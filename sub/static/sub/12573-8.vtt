00:20.957 --> 00:22.207
Mistress Denna.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.026
General Nass.

00:30.361 --> 00:32.782
I wish I could say
this was a pleasure.

00:33.975 --> 00:36.075
The Seeker has been tracking me,

00:36.313 --> 00:39.063
trying to get his hands
on the Box of Orden.

00:39.384 --> 00:40.834
He must be stopped.

00:42.051 --> 00:44.545
You command
an entire legion, General.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.110
Surely you can kill one man.

00:47.476 --> 00:49.334
I have received new orders.

00:49.589 --> 00:52.432
You are to capture the Seeker.
And train him.

00:53.830 --> 00:56.530
I thought Lord Rahl
wanted the Seeker dead.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.892
Lord Rahl's plans have changed.

01:06.666 --> 01:07.984
1x08 - <i>Denna</i>

01:08.474 --> 01:09.525
Sync: Kasius

01:13.305 --> 01:14.055
Wait.

01:15.601 --> 01:17.151
We're being followed.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.327
Are you sure?

01:26.810 --> 01:28.379
You can't help him.

01:31.149 --> 01:32.249
Or yourself.

01:38.179 --> 01:39.037
Why?

01:45.352 --> 01:46.652
Kahlan, wake up.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.782
It was just a dream.
Everything's fine.

01:52.452 --> 01:53.952
It was just a dream.

01:59.427 --> 02:00.643
I killed you.

02:01.697 --> 02:03.205
Good thing it was just a dream.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.020
What if it wasn't?

02:08.699 --> 02:11.749
What are you talking about?
What else could it be?

02:11.922 --> 02:13.122
A premonition.

02:14.126 --> 02:16.635
- You're not going to kill me.
- But the Prophecy...

02:17.506 --> 02:20.473
- Shota said I would betray you.
- You know what Zedd thinks of her.

02:20.731 --> 02:24.331
- We can't trust her. She's a witch.
- A very powerful witch.

02:25.759 --> 02:29.009
One who knows what's written
on the halls of Prophecy:

02:29.475 --> 02:31.859
"The One in White
will betray the Seeker."

02:34.444 --> 02:37.290
You could never do
anything to betray me, ever.

02:37.415 --> 02:40.065
It goes against
everything you believe in.

02:40.263 --> 02:41.869
I'm a danger to you.

02:45.711 --> 02:48.261
I know we haven't known
each other long,

02:48.399 --> 02:50.404
but in my whole life,

02:51.523 --> 02:54.214
there's no one
that I've trusted more,

02:56.023 --> 02:57.373
cared about more.

03:01.879 --> 03:02.673
I...

03:10.246 --> 03:11.390
You what?

03:49.355 --> 03:51.600
- This isn't right.
- Why not?

03:52.315 --> 03:53.865
You don't understand.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.534
You're right, I don't.

03:57.971 --> 03:58.696
This?

03:59.994 --> 04:01.394
This can never be.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.659
There are two roads to Briamont.
We should approach from the south.

04:13.784 --> 04:15.484
I'm not coming with you.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.779
What are you talking about?

04:18.652 --> 04:21.303
It's too dangerous for me
to be near Richard.

04:21.428 --> 04:25.431
Is this because of what that she-devil
Shota told you about some Prophecy?

04:26.722 --> 04:29.935
I know you think Prophecy
can be averted. You tried to do it

04:30.415 --> 04:32.715
when you took Richard into Hartland.

04:33.378 --> 04:35.024
But it didn't work, did it?

04:35.954 --> 04:39.687
Forget what I believe.
You can't abandon Richard.

04:40.185 --> 04:41.835
I'm not abandoning him,

04:43.045 --> 04:45.713
- I'm protecting him.
- From what exactly?

04:51.465 --> 04:52.715
You were right.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.544
I do have feelings for him.

04:58.093 --> 04:59.393
Last night, I...

05:01.382 --> 05:03.219
I almost lost control
of those feelings.

05:05.278 --> 05:07.128
If I hadn't stopped myself,

05:07.659 --> 05:09.909
Richard would've been lost forever.

05:10.388 --> 05:13.729
- The Prophecy would've been fulfilled.
- But you did stop yourself.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.868
Maybe next time I won't be able to.

05:17.263 --> 05:19.610
You're stronger than that.
You'd never let that happen.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.238
Not on purpose, no.

05:24.430 --> 05:27.076
But how am I to know
how the Prophecy will come to pass?

05:28.327 --> 05:31.860
I could betray him
because of a spell or a trick.

05:34.506 --> 05:37.138
All I know is the Prophecy
cannot be avoided.

05:37.263 --> 05:40.407
All I know is that the Seeker
needs his Confessor.

05:40.532 --> 05:41.757
I've thought of that.

05:42.571 --> 05:46.471
Most Confessors have gone into hiding
since Rahl's been hunting us.

05:47.379 --> 05:50.479
A Confessor I know
has taken refuge in a settlement

05:50.999 --> 05:52.309
a couple days from here.

05:52.629 --> 05:54.313
You took an oath.

05:54.636 --> 05:57.523
I know. But there are other ways
that I can help Richard.

05:58.259 --> 06:00.809
I'm not giving up on him
or his mission.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.780
But I can't stay by his side.

06:06.583 --> 06:10.033
Your feelings for Richard
are what make you afraid, child.

06:11.065 --> 06:12.920
And I can't imagine how hard it must

06:13.045 --> 06:15.082
never to have
what ordinary young people have.

06:15.684 --> 06:17.529
But Richard is strong too.

06:18.341 --> 06:21.291
And if you tell him the truth,
he'll understand.

06:21.889 --> 06:24.633
And you'll find a way
through this maze, together.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.286
I know Richard.

06:26.798 --> 06:29.813
If he knows how I feel about him,
he won't let it go.

06:29.938 --> 06:31.238
He'll follow me,

06:31.808 --> 06:34.758
try to convince me
that there's a future for us,

06:36.970 --> 06:38.270
but there isn't.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.616
That's why he can never know
how I feel about him.

06:44.661 --> 06:45.654
Promise me.

06:48.857 --> 06:50.157
What's going on?

06:51.102 --> 06:53.394
You can't go. I need you.
Zedd needs you.

06:53.519 --> 06:55.405
Every minute I stay,
I'm a danger to you.

06:55.530 --> 06:57.497
I'd be dead right now
if it weren't for you.

06:57.622 --> 07:00.339
You may be dead soon,
or worse, if I stay.

07:00.464 --> 07:03.214
Worse than dead?
What are you talking about?

07:06.769 --> 07:10.069
This has something to do
with what happened last night.

07:11.742 --> 07:14.641
Confessors may be good at reading people
but you're not good at lying.

07:17.692 --> 07:21.190
I'm sorry I kissed you.
I won't don't it again if it upset you.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.276
But you kissed me back.

07:26.264 --> 07:27.714
That was a mistake.

07:29.559 --> 07:32.356
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have the same feelings for me

07:32.481 --> 07:33.744
that I have for you.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.857
I don't have any feelings for you.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.103
And I never will.

07:47.255 --> 07:49.757
- How could you just let her go?
- What would you have me do?

07:49.882 --> 07:52.846
- Spin a wizard's web around her?
- You could've at least taken my side.

07:54.846 --> 07:57.396
There's something
you're not telling me.

07:58.951 --> 08:00.460
Lesson 18, Seeker:

08:01.363 --> 08:04.552
Keep to the path ahead,
not the road behind.

08:16.745 --> 08:18.245
Richard, behind you!

08:26.692 --> 08:27.736
Mord-Sith.

08:29.246 --> 08:32.900
Richard, we can't fight them.
We have to leave now!

08:33.207 --> 08:34.847
Don't use the Sword!

09:00.707 --> 09:02.007
Get the old man.

09:06.086 --> 09:07.686
We've lost the Wizard.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.465
We have what we came for.

09:30.753 --> 09:33.671
You may call me Mistress Denna.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.075
Are you tired?

09:37.765 --> 09:39.578
Tell me where my friend is.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.414
When you're asked a question,
you'll answer.

09:44.838 --> 09:46.697
Are you tired?

09:47.435 --> 09:49.135
Would you like to sleep?

09:49.680 --> 09:52.216
I'm not even gonna close my eyes
till I get out of this place.

09:52.923 --> 09:55.461
Then you'll be a very weary boy.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.429
Because what I have planned

09:58.973 --> 10:02.980
is going to make you beg me
for the respite of a warm bed.

10:13.133 --> 10:15.686
Tell me where my friend is.

10:16.848 --> 10:19.493
The Wizard is dead.
I killed him myself.

10:20.810 --> 10:21.960
You're lying.

10:22.136 --> 10:24.790
You've never encountered
a Mord-Sith before, have you?

10:26.464 --> 10:29.005
We can capture and control

10:29.284 --> 10:31.838
any form of magic
that's directed at us.

10:32.694 --> 10:34.294
That's why your friend

10:34.682 --> 10:37.232
tried to warn you
not to use your Sword.

10:37.912 --> 10:39.962
I turned its power against you.

10:41.486 --> 10:45.193
And then, I burned your friend
to the ground

10:45.318 --> 10:47.585
with his own Wizard's Fire.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.377
Does it upset you to learn this?

10:55.848 --> 10:56.898
Not really.

10:57.535 --> 11:00.033
The old man
was getting on my nerves anyway.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.677
Now who's the liar?

11:09.067 --> 11:11.867
Those belonged to the other men
I've trained.

11:13.300 --> 11:16.823
It's an honor to add the Sword of Truth
to my collection.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.473
I wouldn't grow too fond of it
if I were you.

11:19.598 --> 11:23.286
It's just that sort
of rebellious attitude

11:23.516 --> 11:26.601
that's made you something
of a problem for Lord Rahl.

11:27.732 --> 11:29.521
Rahl's days are numbered.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.400
He was going to kill you,

11:34.659 --> 11:38.655
but now, in his wisdom, he sees
that this would only make you a martyr.

11:39.020 --> 11:42.270
Perhaps turn even more people
to your misguided cause.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.124
So instead, he's given me the honor

11:46.560 --> 11:47.831
of training you.

11:48.703 --> 11:50.403
No one's gonna train me.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.833
Did you not feel my Agiel?

11:56.224 --> 11:57.774
The harder you fight,

11:58.184 --> 12:00.684
the more painful
its magic will become.

12:04.018 --> 12:07.453
And after I've finished
training you with it,

12:08.079 --> 12:10.424
you'll do anything to please me.

12:11.517 --> 12:12.467
Anything.

12:14.953 --> 12:17.005
And nothing will please me more

12:17.697 --> 12:19.359
than to see the Seeker,

12:20.814 --> 12:23.464
stand at the gates
of the People's Palace,

12:23.674 --> 12:25.886
and there, before the multitudes,

12:26.011 --> 12:28.106
take the hand of Lord Rahl

12:28.448 --> 12:31.466
and pledge his undying love

12:31.688 --> 12:33.088
and fealty to him.

12:37.541 --> 12:39.639
I'm going to take that Sword,

12:40.603 --> 12:42.803
and I'm going to kill him with it.

12:44.872 --> 12:46.222
After I kill you.

12:48.749 --> 12:51.466
I do enjoy a challenge.

12:52.411 --> 12:53.661
Shall we begin?

13:05.965 --> 13:07.815
What is your business here?

13:08.028 --> 13:10.580
I'm looking for a friend.
She lives in the village.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.624
This "friend," who is she?

13:13.672 --> 13:16.332
My friend is very fond
of white roses?

13:19.310 --> 13:21.110
You're a friend of Lara's.

13:21.248 --> 13:23.801
- Welcome.
- It's an honor to be asked,

13:24.273 --> 13:27.823
but I don't know if I'm ready
to be Confessor to the Seeker.

13:29.196 --> 13:31.977
I have faith in you, Lara.
You can do this.

13:33.454 --> 13:35.504
I've made so many friends here.

13:35.706 --> 13:38.817
The villagers, the past few years,
they've come to depend on me

13:39.122 --> 13:41.703
to guide them in their affairs,
keep order.

13:41.828 --> 13:43.739
I will give them
whatever help they need.

13:51.724 --> 13:53.999
Then I would be honored
to serve the Seeker.

14:23.666 --> 14:25.216
Saved some rainwater.

14:34.397 --> 14:35.547
I'm Benedict.

14:39.527 --> 14:41.171
Why are they keeping you prisoner?

14:43.731 --> 14:44.716
My daughter.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.719
I was asleep in my bed

14:49.308 --> 14:51.608
when those D'Haran animals broke in.

14:52.274 --> 14:54.674
They took me
and my youngest, Mariel.

14:55.421 --> 14:57.839
- She's only 8.
- She's here?

14:58.504 --> 15:00.524
She's in another temple.

15:01.112 --> 15:03.012
She's undergoing the Trials.

15:04.369 --> 15:07.864
If she lives through them,
they'll turn her into a Mord-Sith.

15:08.638 --> 15:11.952
- But she's only a child.
- That's how they create these monsters.

15:13.221 --> 15:15.971
They kidnap young girls
from their families,

15:16.409 --> 15:18.248
punish them mercilessly

15:18.373 --> 15:21.473
until there's not a shred of kindness
left in them.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.138
Then they teach them dark magic

15:24.414 --> 15:26.540
and how to use it to torture,

15:27.710 --> 15:30.063
in the service of Darken Rahl.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.766
My daughter's final test
will be to kill me.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.230
To prove she's one of them.

15:46.595 --> 15:48.485
Maybe we both can't escape.

15:49.737 --> 15:52.200
But if I can keep them busy,
you might have a chance.

15:52.689 --> 15:54.339
You don't even know me.

15:55.401 --> 15:56.746
Why would you do this?

15:59.522 --> 16:02.772
Why did you give me your water
when you had so little?

16:04.148 --> 16:06.098
I know how difficult this is.

16:07.317 --> 16:10.802
It's not easy for me, either.
I consider all of you family.

16:11.390 --> 16:13.378
But the Seeker needs my help.

16:15.431 --> 16:17.731
Kahlan has come to take care of you.

16:18.242 --> 16:22.239
You will all honor and obey her,
as if she were me.

16:24.903 --> 16:26.953
We will do as you say, My Lady.

16:34.063 --> 16:36.663
Why are these people
kneeling before you?

16:41.277 --> 16:42.584
You must tell the truth.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.588
Have you used your power
to confess them?

16:50.679 --> 16:52.479
I have confessed them all.

17:00.861 --> 17:02.960
You turned them into slaves.

17:03.085 --> 17:05.685
And commanded them
to ignore their fears.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.808
They drove the D'Harans
out of the village.

17:09.157 --> 17:12.050
I gave them a purpose,
strength to defend their homes,

17:12.175 --> 17:14.657
- rebuild their lives.
- And become your obedient servants.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.618
I didn't do this for myself.
I did it to help them.

17:19.646 --> 17:20.797
Are you sure?

17:21.537 --> 17:24.319
No part of you enjoys
making these people worship you?

17:24.444 --> 17:25.752
Do anything that you ask?

17:26.766 --> 17:28.016
This man, Raph,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.465
have you taken him as your lover?

17:32.132 --> 17:34.135
And how many have you confessed?

17:34.871 --> 17:36.271
That is different.

17:36.998 --> 17:40.705
I've confessed enemies in battle,
to protect the Seeker and his mission.

17:40.830 --> 17:43.480
And only when it was
absolutely necessary.

17:43.804 --> 17:47.148
Who are you to tell me
what I did wasn't necessary?

17:47.945 --> 17:49.526
I did what I thought was right.

17:49.770 --> 17:52.370
These people are safe now,
they're happy.

17:54.283 --> 17:56.741
- Lara!
- It's all right. He's a friend.

17:57.595 --> 18:00.328
- What is it? What happened?
- Richard's been captured

18:00.742 --> 18:02.094
by the Mord-Sith.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.395
Get up!

18:20.145 --> 18:20.974
Run!

18:27.188 --> 18:28.004
Go!

18:28.498 --> 18:30.248
What are you waiting for?

18:37.527 --> 18:38.408
Mistress.

18:40.084 --> 18:43.290
You didn't really think Benedict
would leave us, did you?

18:43.415 --> 18:45.165
We're practically family.

18:45.449 --> 18:47.699
I would never betray you, Mistress.

18:48.353 --> 18:50.903
I told him
everything you said I should.

18:51.142 --> 18:53.631
So everything you told me
about your daughter was a lie?

18:54.518 --> 18:55.818
That's all true.

18:56.333 --> 18:59.571
But now after being here with us
these past few months,

18:59.696 --> 19:01.915
Benedict realizes
what an honor it is

19:02.040 --> 19:04.142
to have his daughter chosen
to be Mord-Sith.

19:04.559 --> 19:06.936
- Don't you, Benedict?
- Yes, Mistress.

19:07.289 --> 19:08.812
You planned this?

19:09.337 --> 19:10.064
Why?

19:10.533 --> 19:13.943
To show you the futility
of trying to resist me.

19:25.893 --> 19:27.582
You surprise me, Seeker.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.350
You could have run, might have
even made it to the main gate.

19:32.007 --> 19:34.707
But you gave up
your one chance at freedom,

19:35.053 --> 19:37.153
all for a child you'd never met.

19:38.712 --> 19:39.385
Why?

19:40.715 --> 19:42.965
To keep her from becoming like you.

19:46.163 --> 19:48.895
Mord-Sith will torture him
within an inch of his life.

19:49.552 --> 19:52.037
And when they're done,
he'll do whatever they command:

19:52.162 --> 19:53.328
lie, murder.

19:53.721 --> 19:55.863
They could turn him
into a pawn of Darken Rahl.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.362
Richard will resist.

19:57.984 --> 19:59.822
He'll fight the pain, yes.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.200
But their Agiels can break any man.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.327
Not even Richard
can hold out against them.

20:04.992 --> 20:06.746
I couldn't even try to defend him.

20:07.292 --> 20:10.692
They would've taken my powers
and turned them against me.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.110
And without my magic,
I'm just an old man in a robe.

20:14.701 --> 20:16.297
There must be a way to save him.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.315
I followed the Mord-Sith
back to their temple.

20:20.014 --> 20:22.862
There are dozens of D'Haran guards.
We don't have the men

20:22.987 --> 20:25.431
- to overwhelm their defenses.
- I can get you the men.

20:27.111 --> 20:29.435
- Absolutely not.
- What do you mean, no?

20:29.925 --> 20:32.475
She's confessed
everyone in the village.

20:34.681 --> 20:35.484
What?

20:35.827 --> 20:38.069
You heard what the Mord-Sith
will do to the Seeker.

20:38.688 --> 20:42.464
- We'll save him some other way.
- What other way is there?

20:42.968 --> 20:46.036
You asked me to take up your mission
to protect the Seeker.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.311
- That's what I'm offering to do.
- You're offering.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.090
Not the people
you'd be ordering into battle.

20:52.215 --> 20:53.815
They'd have no choice.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.900
If we have any chance
of saving Richard,

20:58.025 --> 20:59.813
we have to go now.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.690
I know what you're doing.
Trying to use your mind to escape.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.367
Everybody tries it.

21:18.709 --> 21:20.109
But it won't work.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.363
Because even your thoughts
belong to me.

21:23.781 --> 21:25.575
Can you tell what I'm thinking now?

21:34.455 --> 21:35.305
If I...

21:36.873 --> 21:39.421
touch you here with the Agiel,

21:40.121 --> 21:41.671
your heart will stop.

21:43.134 --> 21:44.245
Now tell me,

21:44.736 --> 21:46.524
who were you with?

21:48.377 --> 21:49.877
Rahl wants me alive,

21:50.451 --> 21:52.001
you said so yourself.

21:53.026 --> 21:54.276
If you kill me,

21:55.091 --> 21:56.991
imagine what he'd do to you.

22:39.889 --> 22:41.939
It's called the Breath of Life.

22:42.666 --> 22:45.716
It's used to revive those
who die during training.

22:47.386 --> 22:48.688
I was dead?

22:50.027 --> 22:51.427
For a few minutes.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.776
You were nearly a permanent resident
of the underworld.

22:57.427 --> 22:58.527
Now you know

22:59.356 --> 23:01.756
not even death
will end your torture.

23:06.659 --> 23:07.620
The Agiel

23:08.349 --> 23:10.349
is so much more than a weapon.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.020
When I stopped your heart with it,

23:14.423 --> 23:15.992
it left a part of me

23:16.562 --> 23:17.362
here.

23:19.601 --> 23:20.801
Our hearts,

23:21.414 --> 23:23.264
our minds are becoming one.

23:24.725 --> 23:26.775
Soon your only thought will be,

23:27.809 --> 23:29.699
"How can I please my mistress?"

23:32.568 --> 23:35.495
Then everything will be
so much easier for you.

23:36.912 --> 23:38.916
I won't have to hurt you anymore.

23:41.410 --> 23:42.910
Would you like that?

23:46.071 --> 23:48.121
But first, you have to tell me,

23:48.702 --> 23:50.452
who were you thinking of?

23:53.288 --> 23:54.738
Her name is Kahlan.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.008
Kahlan

24:00.644 --> 24:01.522
Amnell.

24:05.222 --> 24:06.736
You're in love with her.

24:09.605 --> 24:11.205
Has she confessed you?

24:11.848 --> 24:13.598
Is that why you love her?

24:17.048 --> 24:19.248
Kahlan would never do
anything to hurt me.

24:21.173 --> 24:24.253
And she would never need magic
to make me love her.

24:25.605 --> 24:27.105
She didn't tell you.

24:28.798 --> 24:29.948
Tell me what?

24:30.485 --> 24:32.720
If you and Kahlan
were to be together,

24:33.347 --> 24:34.347
even once,

24:35.006 --> 24:36.641
her power would be unleashed.

24:37.897 --> 24:41.372
It would overwhelm you
and destroy your soul.

24:42.484 --> 24:44.765
You would be her slave forever.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.694
That's not true.

24:50.103 --> 24:53.241
You never wondered
why she didn't return your feelings?

24:54.278 --> 24:56.890
A noble, brave young man
like the Seeker,

24:57.991 --> 25:00.289
so pleasing to the eye of any woman?

25:07.418 --> 25:10.190
<i>This isn't right.
This can never be.</i>

25:13.061 --> 25:16.055
I can't believe your Wizard friend
never warned you.

25:18.274 --> 25:19.547
<i>None of that, boy.</i>

25:19.672 --> 25:22.019
<i>It can never be.
Not with her.</i>

25:25.894 --> 25:28.359
I don't want to see you
suffer anymore.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.600
I have other duties to attend today,

25:36.476 --> 25:39.115
so Constance will be training you.

25:39.633 --> 25:41.247
And she's very brutal.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.276
So I want you

25:43.719 --> 25:46.086
to create a refuge in your mind,

25:46.883 --> 25:48.283
as you did before.

25:49.587 --> 25:52.087
But you told me
not to think of Kahlan.

25:55.355 --> 25:57.857
I want you to think of me.

26:32.688 --> 26:34.338
I did what you told me.

26:34.962 --> 26:36.384
I wasn't with her.

26:37.092 --> 26:38.342
I was with you.

26:39.396 --> 26:40.572
You did well.

26:50.819 --> 26:54.223
But there's still a part of you
that's defiant.

26:55.326 --> 26:56.626
You're thinking,

26:57.116 --> 26:58.868
if you grab my Agiel,

26:59.345 --> 27:01.895
you might be able
to fight your way out.

27:03.547 --> 27:04.547
Go ahead.

27:05.197 --> 27:06.247
Pick it up.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.040
After withstanding so much,

27:09.752 --> 27:11.819
I won't deny you the chance.

27:26.916 --> 27:29.207
I just wanted you to understand

27:29.936 --> 27:33.614
that an Agiel causes constant pain
to anyone who it touches,

27:34.612 --> 27:36.764
even the person who wields it.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.363
Well, if it hurts you...

27:46.106 --> 27:47.106
I'm sorry.

27:47.582 --> 27:48.532
Don't be.

27:49.676 --> 27:53.026
Pain is the one experience common
to every living thing.

27:54.044 --> 27:55.194
It unites us.

27:56.732 --> 27:58.882
Mord-Sith are taught to use pain,

27:59.745 --> 28:00.951
to channel it,

28:01.394 --> 28:02.591
control it,

28:03.819 --> 28:05.266
just as you are learning.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.742
The Mord-Sith and the D'Harans
are fearsome.

28:11.867 --> 28:15.822
But their swords and dark magic
cannot break the love that bonds us.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.729
The battle tonight will be ours.

28:19.854 --> 28:22.135
We will free the Seeker.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.310
We will do as you bid, My Lady.

28:25.543 --> 28:28.093
I can't let these people
be slaughtered.

28:29.131 --> 28:31.751
They'll fight without fear.
The advantage is ours.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.036
You're ordering them into battle

28:34.161 --> 28:36.881
against trained D'Haran soldiers
and Mord-Sith.

28:37.842 --> 28:41.623
Because they have no fear doesn't mean
they won't be outmatched and killed.

28:41.748 --> 28:44.388
When that happens, any hope
of saving Richard dies with them.

28:45.104 --> 28:46.974
How else do we get Richard out?

28:48.299 --> 28:51.780
If I can find a way to talk
to Richard, get through to him,

28:51.905 --> 28:54.005
remind him that he's the Seeker,

28:54.437 --> 28:58.235
- maybe we can find a way out, together.
- And what if he's already broken?

28:59.076 --> 29:02.198
Maybe I can get close enough to kill
the Mord-Sith who's been training him,

29:02.958 --> 29:04.658
break her hold over him.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.434
One hour.

29:07.924 --> 29:09.205
That's all I ask.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.030
If I don't come back by then...

29:17.229 --> 29:18.881
May the Spirits protect you, child.

29:28.617 --> 29:32.144
Mistress Denna, would you allow
Constance to train me tomorrow?

29:36.062 --> 29:38.536
Why are you asking for Constance!?

29:39.730 --> 29:41.825
You prefer her touch to mine?

29:43.876 --> 29:47.731
Obviously I've been too easy on you!

29:49.505 --> 29:52.302
Why do you ask for her?
Answer me.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.643
Because it hurts you
to use the Agiel.

29:57.996 --> 30:01.046
I don't want you to suffer any more
because of me.

30:11.587 --> 30:14.187
I've never known
anyone like you, Seeker.

30:18.959 --> 30:21.109
There's someone at the main gate.

30:21.546 --> 30:23.654
Send them away!

30:24.311 --> 30:25.661
It's a Confessor.

30:37.429 --> 30:39.031
You must be Kahlan.

30:40.063 --> 30:42.163
Richard's told me all about you.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.298
Apparently he was in love with you.

30:45.837 --> 30:47.136
But not anymore.

30:47.801 --> 30:49.102
I can see why.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.850
You're not quite as impressive
as I'd imagined.

30:54.217 --> 30:57.219
I have a hundred men
in the hills ready for battle.

30:57.344 --> 30:59.441
They're preparing
to strike this temple.

30:59.566 --> 31:03.549
My scouts tell me that there are
only two dozen men in the hills.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.488
And they're not fighters,

31:05.742 --> 31:08.031
they're common villagers.

31:08.725 --> 31:12.453
They're not common at all.
Every one of them has been confessed.

31:13.133 --> 31:15.581
They'll fight to the death
to save the Seeker.

31:15.871 --> 31:17.871
If they attack, many will die.

31:19.192 --> 31:20.294
Maybe even you.

31:21.694 --> 31:23.494
I want to avoid bloodshed.

31:25.727 --> 31:27.627
I know how powerful you are.

31:30.678 --> 31:33.278
All I ask is to talk
to the Seeker alone.

31:35.090 --> 31:36.340
To say goodbye.

31:39.274 --> 31:41.565
My scouts also observed

31:42.192 --> 31:44.151
another Confessor on the hill.

31:44.735 --> 31:47.112
And from what Richard
has told me about you,

31:48.298 --> 31:52.066
you would never use your power
to enslave innocent villagers.

31:52.982 --> 31:55.432
It must have been
the other Confessor.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.672
So all I need to do is kill her,

32:00.206 --> 32:02.419
and the spell on her followers
would be broken.

32:30.686 --> 32:32.895
You made a wise choice, Richard.

32:34.156 --> 32:35.872
I'm very proud of you.

32:55.053 --> 32:56.053
I'm sorry.

32:57.762 --> 33:01.762
I didn't want to hurt you, but
Denna's archers would have killed you.

33:02.328 --> 33:03.856
We have to get you out of here.

33:05.473 --> 33:07.067
I don't know if I can leave.

33:07.770 --> 33:09.620
I'm losing myself to Denna.

33:10.267 --> 33:12.698
I tried to fight,
but her magic is too strong.

33:14.037 --> 33:16.437
Most of the time,
I can't even think.

33:16.677 --> 33:18.871
I do anything she asks me to.

33:20.763 --> 33:23.682
- You can resist her.
- She's going to make me stand with Rahl

33:23.807 --> 33:25.707
and swear allegiance to him.

33:26.177 --> 33:28.827
- You'd never do that.
- I might do worse.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.183
I can't defy her,

33:31.929 --> 33:34.011
especially when she's near me
with her Agiel.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.297
If she orders me to kill you,

33:39.880 --> 33:41.935
I might not be able to stop myself.

33:44.926 --> 33:45.984
I know you.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.720
You're strong enough.

33:52.557 --> 33:54.107
There might be a way.

33:54.554 --> 33:55.449
Tell me.

33:56.645 --> 33:57.618
Confess me.

34:02.797 --> 34:05.597
- Richard I can't confess you.
- You have to.

34:05.743 --> 34:09.693
- I'd destroy everything that you are.
- Denna's already doing that.

34:10.130 --> 34:12.228
If you confess me, I can fight her.

34:12.353 --> 34:14.259
I'd rather be your slave than hers.

34:14.429 --> 34:17.763
You can fight her without magic.
Look inside yourself.

34:18.103 --> 34:19.013
I have.

34:20.078 --> 34:23.018
But when I do,
I don't see myself anymore.

34:23.612 --> 34:24.862
I only see her.

34:28.942 --> 34:29.850
Please!

34:30.158 --> 34:31.257
You have to!

34:33.027 --> 34:34.356
Shota was right.

34:34.803 --> 34:36.353
You have betrayed me.

34:36.928 --> 34:38.492
I betrayed you by leaving.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.121
If I'd have stayed with you,
none of this would've happened.

34:48.991 --> 34:51.117
- How much longer?
- Patience.

34:51.614 --> 34:54.179
We gave her what she asked for.
It's been an hour.

34:54.304 --> 34:56.027
She's not coming back.

34:57.566 --> 35:00.116
I want you
to take your men to the left.

35:03.284 --> 35:04.268
After them!

35:07.305 --> 35:09.385
My Lady...
don't be afraid.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.255
Where are you going?
The Seeker still needs our help!

35:35.265 --> 35:36.966
The Confessor is dead.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.845
Her poor slaves have been
freed from bondage.

35:40.903 --> 35:43.015
There's nobody left
to fight for you.

35:43.929 --> 35:45.600
Before you're executed,

35:46.232 --> 35:48.657
you'll be trained by me.

35:49.582 --> 35:52.742
Rest assured,
your training will be slow

35:53.277 --> 35:54.757
and agonizing.

35:56.918 --> 35:57.918
Of course,

35:58.411 --> 36:00.702
Richard can save you this torment

36:01.277 --> 36:03.625
by granting you a merciful death,

36:04.591 --> 36:06.705
and proving to me, once and for all,

36:06.955 --> 36:09.416
that his training is complete.

36:10.395 --> 36:11.345
Kill her.

36:15.508 --> 36:16.508
Do it now.

36:37.837 --> 36:39.740
Do it now.

36:41.105 --> 36:42.184
Kill her.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.158
Richard, this isn't you.

36:44.288 --> 36:47.579
- I can't.
- Then watch her suffer!

36:50.943 --> 36:52.652
End her pain, Richard.

39:18.931 --> 39:20.181
How did you...?

39:23.554 --> 39:25.854
You taught me how to withstand pain.

39:51.568 --> 39:53.618
We need to get you out of here.

40:16.143 --> 40:18.291
There's something
that I need to tell you.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.583
Denna told me.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.090
Is it true?

40:30.144 --> 40:32.044
Do you know what it was like

40:32.712 --> 40:34.212
hearing it from her?

40:36.105 --> 40:37.755
Why didn't you tell me?

40:41.708 --> 40:45.708
I was afraid that if I told you
the truth, you'd become scared of me.

40:46.288 --> 40:48.138
Your feelings would change.

40:49.665 --> 40:52.225
Well, why would you care
if my feelings changed?

40:52.350 --> 40:54.550
You told me you didn't share them.

40:58.777 --> 41:00.077
Like you said...

41:01.039 --> 41:02.709
I'm not a very good liar.

41:09.559 --> 41:12.859
- So now what?
- I'm not sure.

41:15.478 --> 41:16.628
But I do know

41:18.111 --> 41:20.211
I'm not leaving your side again.

41:21.219 --> 41:22.562
What about the Prophecy?

41:24.762 --> 41:28.261
I can't think of any worse betrayal

41:29.650 --> 41:30.987
than leaving you.

41:33.264 --> 41:35.564
Maybe the Prophecy's been fulfilled.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.027
But Richard...

41:40.155 --> 41:42.655
your mission
is far more important than

41:43.347 --> 41:44.793
any feelings we may have.

41:46.512 --> 41:47.812
That's why we...

41:49.137 --> 41:50.590
We can never act on them.

41:51.828 --> 41:53.718
We can never let our guard down.

41:54.386 --> 41:55.936
We have to bury them.

41:59.337 --> 42:00.637
Can you do that?

42:04.887 --> 42:07.637
If there's one thing
I learned from Denna...

42:09.639 --> 42:11.639
it's how to suffer in silence.

42:25.811 --> 42:26.827
Mistress!
