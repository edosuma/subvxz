- All right.
- Who are you?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.983
My name is Bridget Sullivan.
I work for Colonel Ryan.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.452
- Are you a member of the Unit?
- There are no women
in the Unit.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.691
Now, we are gonna have
a long ride in which to
get to know one another.

42:05.757 --> 42:08.827
- What base are we going to?
- We're not going to a base.

42:08.894 --> 42:11.963
When will I see
my children again?

42:12.030 --> 42:15.033
I promise you,
as soon as I know the answer
you will know it.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.504
Now, I'd like you
to take a look at these.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.940
These are
your new identities.

42:22.007 --> 42:27.178
New names, credit cards,
passport.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.982
Now, we'll start simply.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.919
Memorize your new
Social Security number.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.387
Then we'll start in
on your cover.

42:36.454 --> 42:39.625
- Why are we doing all of this?
- To keep you safe, Ms. Brown.

42:39.691 --> 42:42.794
To keep you
and your families safe.

42:44.262 --> 42:48.266
Now, once upon a time,
I spent quite a bit of time
undercover.

42:48.333 --> 42:52.671
You may think that the problem
lies in trying to remember
your cover and the truth.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.806
Actually,
it's much more simple.

42:54.873 --> 42:57.208
There's only one truth.

42:57.275 --> 42:59.210
Only the cover is true.

43:01.747 --> 43:04.282
The lives you had before
are over.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.989
All right, let's go.

43:11.056 --> 43:14.660
