it's none of my business.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.125
‐ Then I guess
it won't be a problem

16:41.209 --> 16:43.294
if they ask me to stay on
and run the thing?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.630
‐ Kate, if you're asking
if I've contemplated

16:45.713 --> 16:48.466
our working future together,
the answer's yes,

16:48.549 --> 16:50.968
and I made peace with it.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.471
‐ You're evolving.
‐

16:53.554 --> 16:54.889
Moderately.
I don't know.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.477
I'm just finally comfortable
in my own skin.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.812
‐ Wow, I'm speechless.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.564
‐ This whole Spencer thing,

17:03.648 --> 17:06.317
it's really fucked me up.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.778
And now that that's resolved,

17:08.861 --> 17:10.946
I can finally move on.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.157
‐ What do you think
we should do?

17:14.242 --> 17:19.121
‐ Well, Nike's marketing dollars
and distribution infrastructure

17:19.204 --> 17:20.915
could really take us
to the next level.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.921
‐ I was talking about us.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.175
‐ $10 million?

17:31.259 --> 17:33.219
It's a lot of money.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.179
That's enough
to pay for Kiki's college

17:35.263 --> 17:37.723
and her sister's and their kids.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.685
‐ Charles, you know
this is not about the money.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.853
‐ Yeah, but we can't keep living
like this, baby.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.314
You'd have to relocate.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.750
And I'm not gonna pull you
from your work.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.859
‐ All right, all that
is beside the point.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.194
We'll always have enough money.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.696
We'll always have each other.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.698
But you need to make
your health a priority.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.241
Put that rib down

17:55.324 --> 17:57.618
and scoop up
some of those green beans.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.205
‐ Yeah, I guess none of it
really matters

18:01.289 --> 18:02.707
if I'm dead, anyways.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.334
Thankfully, I'll have purpose
going forward.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.712
I got our children,

18:07.795 --> 18:10.548
I got you...

18:10.631 --> 18:12.758
And I can always
just coach here, you know.

What is it you aren't saying?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.476

to yourself.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.730
Can you really walk away
from the Rams?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.624
‐ Oh, so you're gonna bring up
the Rams Super Bowl, huh?

18:27.648 --> 18:28.899
The Rams Super Bowl loss?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.610

You're right.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.789
‐ Hey, my man, can I get
a couple more of these, please?

26:45.813 --> 26:46.897
These kinda small.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.399
‐ That's why you got
high blood pressure now.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.443
‐ ‐ Reggie.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.071
I am honored you came,
now that you're an oligarch.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.030
‐ Hey, don't be bitter.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.240
Business is business.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.950
‐ Wow!
I've taught you well.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.803
It's like you've been
painting fences all month

26:59.827 --> 27:01.078
and now you know karate.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.956
Good afternoon, everyone!

27:04.039 --> 27:05.791
Thanks for coming.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.626
Big day.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.128
Today we pour the foundation
of our future.

27:10.212 --> 27:14.132
I feel so lucky to be surrounded
by my closes friends,

27:14.216 --> 27:16.969
my family‐‐ you are my family.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.556
You have all,
every single one of you,

27:20.639 --> 27:23.600
killed it in your own
individual, special ways.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.936
Like Kate with Municipal Brand.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.479
You're a killer.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.441
And Lance, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

27:31.525 --> 27:33.819
but you've been
a steadying hand.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.547
‐ Yeah, it takes
a special kind of individual

27:35.571 --> 27:37.364
to understand
the mind of a maniac.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.199
‐ Thank you.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.119
Jason,

27:42.202 --> 27:44.621
for a guy that's often
been mistaken

27:44.705 --> 27:47.457
for waiters at hotel pools,

27:47.541 --> 27:49.167
you destroyed it.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.628
Vernon's deal, Patrick's deal‐‐

27:51.712 --> 27:54.965
you're the best agent
in the fucking business,

27:55.048 --> 27:58.010
and I am so proud

27:58.093 --> 27:59.636
to be your fuckin' boss.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.513
‐ Partner.
‐ Hmm?

28:01.597 --> 28:02.973
‐ Partner!

28:03.056 --> 28:04.975
‐

28:05.058 --> 28:06.810
Reg.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.478
You're a trailblazer.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.856
To think of where you started
and where you're going,

28:10.939 --> 28:12.024
it's mind‐blowing.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.901
Kudos, brother.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.321
Just don't get started in
on cocaine.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.823
That's my only advice.

28:19.907 --> 28:20.949
Vern.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.911
The heart you show on the field

28:23.994 --> 28:25.537
and in life

28:25.621 --> 28:31.168
will be infused
in the walls of this complex.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.545
And also, your commissions, too,
will be infused as well.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.629
Thank you.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.594
There he is.
Right on time.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.889
You big bald motherfucker.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.309
I want you to know something.

28:49.436 --> 28:54.399
Wherever we may roam
for the rest of our lives,

28:54.483 --> 28:57.653
when I see you, I'm home.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.282
Brothers for life.

<i>‐ And in the end,
what did you learn?</i>

29:07.371 --> 29:10.749

it's about the journey and...

29:10.832 --> 29:13.043
Sometimes it's about the result.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.463
