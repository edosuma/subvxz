RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race

00:28.800 --> 00:30.320
UK vs. the World...

00:30.320 --> 00:32.320
You need to create a dress

00:32.320 --> 00:35.960
that Mama Ru herself
would want to wear.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.320
Here we go, another
sewing challenge.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.160
As long as it's stitched,
that's a win for me.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.760
Get outta your head, Cheryl.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.160
If Ru loves the color,

00:45.160 --> 00:50.560
maybe she won't really
nitpick on the sewing.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.360
Cheryl Hole.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.320
You're competing against
the rest of the world,

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
and you need to put a bit more
into it,
I'm afraid.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.400
Jujubee.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.200
I feel like, Juju,
you haven't arrived.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.960
I don't know what's going on,
but you need to stop it now.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.960
Janey Jack. Jimbo.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.160
You are the top two queens
of the week.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.680
Thank you.
Why you over Jujubee?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.960
She did well
the first three times.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.080
This is my time back.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.720
If I keep you, does this mean

01:19.720 --> 01:21.480
that I've got
one in the bank with Juju?

01:21.480 --> 01:24.760
I would do that,
because you're Jimbo.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.760
Janey Jack, con-drag-ulations.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.520
You're a winner, baby.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.360
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

01:33.360 --> 01:34.720
Cheryl.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.480
-Oh, wow.
-Wow.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.960
That was so fun.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.840
That was a--
that was something, honey.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.760
We're back in the werkroom,

01:54.760 --> 01:59.960
and I'm so relieved
that Janey saved me.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.320
But my heart sinks for Cheryl,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.240
because I know how much
she wants this.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.680
"I wasn't threatened.
Still not threatened.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.400
"Love you divas,
XXO, Cheryl Hole.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.560
P.S.: Going for that piss now."

02:14.560 --> 02:16.920
[all laugh]

02:16.920 --> 02:18.640
Oh, Cheryl!

02:18.640 --> 02:20.000
I'm, like, devastated
a little bit,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
but, like, she was
the worst in the challenge,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.560
which is, like,
the bottom line, right?

02:25.560 --> 02:27.840
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna miss Cheryl.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.000
She's my best friend, and that
smile
could light up a werkroom.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.840
-We love you, Cheryl!
-Bye, Cheryl!

02:32.840 --> 02:35.040
I'm gonna miss
that mediocre queen.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.040
Actually,
she's no longer mediocre.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.440
Ugh!

02:39.440 --> 02:41.720
I wanna thank you so much

02:41.720 --> 02:44.400
for letting me
live on another week.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.280
I really appreciate you.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.280
But I am curious.
Who did you choose, Jimbo?

02:49.280 --> 02:50.960
What? [chuckles]

02:50.960 --> 02:52.240
Oh!

02:52.240 --> 02:54.320
[all laugh]

02:54.320 --> 02:56.440
So stupid.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.600
Always some food
on this bitch.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.560
Oh, damn.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.000
Hey, look over there, you guys.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.360
I picked Jujubee by accident.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.200
Okay.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.000
Girl...

03:12.520 --> 03:13.840
Why?

03:13.840 --> 03:16.120
I picked Jujubee because
she's a really good singer,

03:16.120 --> 03:18.360
and I wanna be the one
that sings with Ru.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.240
-Is that the only reason?
-Yeah.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.960
The other girls are gagged
that I have Jujubee's lipstick.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.760
To be honest, so am I.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.000
At the last minute,
the devilish side of me won,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.400
and just was, like, pick
Jujubee,
that's the fun one.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.760
She might beat you.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.800
I'm gagged.
I am gagged.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.800
You know, we were sitting there,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.680
and remember,
we were talking about

03:40.680 --> 03:43.040
you wanted me to save you.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.600
And I found that

03:44.600 --> 03:48.120
that was kind of an agreement
that we had, right?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.120
Eeh.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.040
Well, this is awkward.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.800
So I guess
that's off the table.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.760
No, it's still--
it's on the table.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.000
[all laugh]

03:58.000 --> 04:00.960
I don't understand that at all.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.000
Like, how can you do that?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
You formed that alliance
yourself,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.480
and then you backstab
that person with a big machete.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.960
That is some shady shit.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.520
So essentially,
he broke the alliance.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.680
No, I didn't!

04:14.680 --> 04:17.120
But I will mention
she brought it up, not me.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.760
That's even worse.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.840
And I did say it to both of you.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.160
You said it to Cheryl as well?

04:23.160 --> 04:26.200
I did. I said, "If you save me,
will I save you,"

04:26.200 --> 04:27.280
and all that stuff.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.320
You know,
we are all here to win.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.000
None of us are here
to save each other.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.320
So I'm trying to win.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.280
Girl, well,
you playin' it real.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.880
So Jimbo is the bitch to watch.

04:38.880 --> 04:39.880
-Yes.
-Yeah, I think so.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.000
No, guys,
don't say stuff like that.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.880
But it's good.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.920
So now we know.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.480
I never thought that you were
gonna
be the shady one, Jimbo.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.680
I don't know if I am.
Well, I guess I am.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.080
-I think we know.
-Yeah.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.080
-I am?
-We know.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.800
You are.

04:55.800 --> 05:01.200
She actually gained my trust,
but now all bets are off.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.440
I just can't believe Jimbo
chose me after what she said.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.080
She's a really good liar.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.200
Not only will I be
more wary of Jimbo,

05:10.200 --> 05:13.120
every single queen
in the werkroom will be.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.920
What did I say?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.200
-No, ours is the real one.
-Ours real?

05:18.200 --> 05:19.840
I promise.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.440
And I think, thanks to me, the
competition
has finally started.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
Team bimbo.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.640
Team bimbo
all the freaking way.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.680
Team bimbo.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.120
I hope you do make
an alliance with her,

05:27.120 --> 05:28.120
because she'll flip on you, too.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.760
Oh, baby, that's why

05:29.760 --> 05:31.360
I didn't start
walking over there yet.

A lot, a lot.

And Michelle especially

06:53.160 --> 06:54.840
Are you gonna get here?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.440
-Turn up?
-Yeah.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.920
Yeah, I mean, the best coffee

06:59.920 --> 07:01.400
By Michelle, yeah.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.600
I think Juju
seems very worried.

She rose the bar
so high for herself

that she can't get up there,
and I feel for her.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.080
Okay, news, real quick, ladies.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.240
I know that I have been
going by Monique Heart

07:16.240 --> 07:17.640
since the beginning
of my drag career,

07:17.640 --> 07:19.000
especially on Drag Race,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.320
but I would really prefer
to be known as just "Mo."

07:22.320 --> 07:23.960
-Oh, okay.
-So just call me Mo.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.960
Though I present
a female aesthetic,

07:27.960 --> 07:32.080
I would like to be known
as a genderless entertainer.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.840
It opens it up for so much mo',

07:35.840 --> 07:39.320
and what better platform to do
it on,
to let the world know?

07:39.320 --> 07:42.080
I'm changing my name
to Mo Heart.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.560
But if you can,
just call me Mo,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.960
like Mo Heart, Mo Love,
Mo this, Mo that.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.720
They tried to call you Monique,
but you said Mo.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.240
Yeah! [laughs]

07:51.240 --> 07:53.800
But wait.
Can y'all call me Amber?

Anyway, regardless,
I'm here to win this week,

-Hello, RuPaul!
-Hi!

08:15.720 --> 08:18.680
It's the hard-knock life,
old chum,

08:18.680 --> 08:21.040
so whenever things get rocky,

08:21.040 --> 08:24.720
remember, somewhere
over the rainbow

08:24.720 --> 08:26.560
there's a lonely goatherder

08:26.560 --> 08:32.080
saying, "Mama mia,
that's a spicy meatball."

08:32.080 --> 08:33.880

08:35.000 --> 08:36.560
-Musical. Has to be.

-Yes!

08:47.040 --> 08:48.400
-Hi-ee!
-Hi-ee!

08:48.400 --> 08:51.560
Now, in a world divided,
the art of drag

08:51.560 --> 08:55.080
encourages us
to set aside our differences

08:55.080 --> 08:59.720
and heal with love,
laughter, and compassion.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.200
That is why I proclaim today

09:03.200 --> 09:07.000

on-brand for you.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.400
Yeah.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.760
That explains
when you do the lip sync,

10:16.760 --> 10:18.160
you go down like the Titanic.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.400
[all laugh]

10:21.400 --> 10:24.200
Mama Ru, I love your look today.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.840
You're really putting
the "whore" in "seahorse."

10:26.840 --> 10:28.040
Thank you!

10:28.040 --> 10:29.200
Now tell a joke.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.040
[all laugh]

10:33.520 --> 10:35.680
-Pangina Heals.
-Yes.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.320
The only thing wider
than your back is Baga's ass,

10:37.320 --> 10:38.800
and that smells better.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.440
[all laugh]

10:42.440 --> 10:43.600
Accurate.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.400
[laughs]

10:45.400 --> 10:47.200
Mo Heart, you've been
passed around

10:47.200 --> 10:49.880
more than
a donation basket on Sunday...

10:49.880 --> 10:51.760
[all laugh]

10:51.760 --> 10:53.000
...and gotten less change.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.040
[all laugh]

10:55.040 --> 10:57.000
Only in Canada.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.720
Jujubee.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.000
It's quite ironic that
you've been here four times,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.840
because when you
walked down the runway

11:04.840 --> 11:06.400
in that Make it Yourself dress,

11:06.400 --> 11:09.400
you had four back rolls. Yay!

11:09.400 --> 11:13.280
[fake laugh]

11:13.280 --> 11:15.720
Jimbo, Jimbo, Jimbo.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.280
Do you know why
you haven't won a lip sync?

11:17.280 --> 11:20.000
Because there isn't a ring to

11:20.000 --> 11:22.040
"You're a winner, Granddad."

11:22.040 --> 11:24.760
[all laugh]

11:24.760 --> 11:28.400
J.J. and Pangina,
I would love to read you,

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
but like most
international pop stars,

11:30.400 --> 11:32.120
you didn't make it big
in the States.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.240
Blu Hydrangea.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.160
More like
a dead funeral wreath.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.960
Baga Chipz.
More like Jabba the Hutt.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.400
[laughs]

11:46.400 --> 11:48.080
We can tell
you are the filler queen,

11:48.080 --> 11:51.080
until we saw Blu Hydrangea.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.080
Ooh!

11:52.080 --> 11:54.960
Tumbleweeds for these jokes,
bitch.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.080
[all chuckle]

11:59.120 --> 12:01.080
That's it?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.000
Really?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.200
Pangina. Okay,
so RuPaul was looking

12:06.200 --> 12:09.800
for the most beautiful, talented
drag queen from Thailand.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.000
Was she busy?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.600
[all laugh]

12:12.600 --> 12:14.720
She was, she was.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.520
Janey Jack, you put the "ho"
in "Holland."

12:18.520 --> 12:22.280
Now, I hear that tulips
are the biggest export.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.440
Is that what happened to yours?

12:23.440 --> 12:26.240
[all laugh]

12:26.240 --> 12:32.120
And of course, the people's
love,
Baga Chipz.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.160
You walked into the room
as Princess Di,

12:34.160 --> 12:37.880
but I just saw
Princess Di-arrhea.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.320
[all laugh]

12:44.960 --> 12:46.040
Bitch!

12:46.040 --> 12:49.760
Juju will read
the piss outta you.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.680
I live for it.
I live, I live!

12:52.680 --> 12:55.960
Janey Jack. If I wanted
to read something Dutch,

12:55.960 --> 12:57.800
bitch, I would have
watched your season.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.000
-[tongue pop]
-But lucky you're cute.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.320
When you go home next,
my room's 228.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.840
See you there!

13:02.840 --> 13:05.360
Ooh! Okay!

13:05.360 --> 13:07.280
I feel dirty.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.560
Jujubee.
More like Juju has-been.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.520
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

13:12.680 --> 13:14.880
Jimbo, your tits
are the biggest thing

13:14.880 --> 13:16.400
that's entered this werkroom,

13:16.400 --> 13:18.400
apart from Baga's
cheap veneers.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.320
-Ooh!
-Oh!

13:20.320 --> 13:22.240
Oh, dear.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.360
You'll go to hell!

13:23.360 --> 13:26.960
Huh. But I had my teeth done
in Harley Street, bitch.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.480
What has this show
done to you, Blu?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.440
I know. It's ruined me.

13:31.440 --> 13:36.080
Ladykins, it's nice to see
that you're all fluent

13:36.080 --> 13:40.360
in the international language
of throwing shade,

13:40.360 --> 13:44.960
but one of you
is truly dark-sided.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.840
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

13:48.880 --> 13:51.680
Jujubee.
[cheering]

13:51.680 --> 13:52.960
Again?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.320
[all laugh]

13:55.320 --> 13:58.240
Juju, you're not getting older,
you're getting shadier.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.840
[all laugh]
Wiser.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.560
[laughs]

14:02.560 --> 14:06.680
Now, ladies, it's time
to step out of the shade

14:06.680 --> 14:08.280
and into the spotlight.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.400
[gasps]

14:09.400 --> 14:11.120
For this week's maxi-challenge,

14:11.120 --> 14:16.200
you'll be starring in the lip
sync
Rusical reality show

14:16.200 --> 14:18.960
West End Wendys: The Comeback.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.960
[cheering]

14:22.960 --> 14:27.920
Now, each of you will play an
iconic
but faded West End star

14:27.920 --> 14:30.960
who's clawing her way
back to the top.

14:30.960 --> 14:36.840
Roles up for grabs
are Widdle Orphan Fannie,

14:36.840 --> 14:40.960
a former child star whose
tomorrows
don't look so bright.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.280
-Oh.
-Oh.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.800
There's Tracey Fatberg,
the former sixties dancing star

14:46.800 --> 14:49.840
with a teeny addiction
to hairspray.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.040
Ooh!

14:51.040 --> 14:56.520
Lally Bowelz, with a "Z,"
the irrepressible performer

14:56.520 --> 14:59.280
who's ready for
another comeback, mama.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.760
-Oh, that's definitely Baga.
-The old queen.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.560
There's Mariah Gon Trappy,

15:03.560 --> 15:06.760
a nun with a dirty, dirty habit.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.200
[chuckles]

15:08.200 --> 15:11.840
There's Dr. Spank-N-Spurter,
a born-again virgin.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.920
Think Michelle Visage.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.120
-[laughs]
-Oh.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.880
There's Meryl Streep,

15:16.880 --> 15:20.720
the Hollywood megastar
who can't say no.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.800
Okay.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.000
And there's Dodo the Dog,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.280
a Kansas girl's
former best friend,

15:27.280 --> 15:31.320
who's ready to take her hidden
talents
over the rainbow.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.000
Now, Juju, you won
the mini-challenge,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.040
so you get to assign the roles.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.920
Wow!

15:39.920 --> 15:42.040
This is my first Rusical.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.760
♪ I'm so excited ♪

15:43.760 --> 15:45.640
And I get to assign roles.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.720
[chuckles]

15:47.720 --> 15:50.040
Later you'll be meeting
with your choreographer,

15:50.040 --> 15:53.000
the Strictly fabulous
Johannes Rabede.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.080
[cheers and applause]

15:57.080 --> 16:02.120
Ladies, I expect nothing less
than
the performance of a lifetime.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.040
Racers, start your engines,

16:06.040 --> 16:07.960
and may the best drag queen win.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.920
[cheering]

16:10.920 --> 16:12.440
Let's have a good listen first.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.280
Is everybody ready?
Three, two, one.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.960
I love musicals,
and every time I go to see one,

16:17.960 --> 16:20.320
I just wish I could be
up on that stage.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.400
But I can't sing,
so doing a lip sync Rusical

16:23.400 --> 16:25.160
is me living my fantasy.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.320
This is brilliant.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.240
-They are all awesome.
-It's so good.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.880
Those parts are really good.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.400
-Yeah, they're awesome.
-They're all really good.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.360
I'm gonna let the other girls
just choose
what part they want,

16:34.360 --> 16:36.200
because I think
that's the most fair thing.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.200
First come, first serve.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.440
Sure, I have the power

16:39.440 --> 16:41.280
to choose parts
for everybody, right,

16:41.280 --> 16:42.720
but what does everybody want?

16:42.720 --> 16:44.840
I wanna be Liza Minnelli.
She's my idol.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.920
I'll be Dr. Spank.
That one, and Lally Bowelz.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.280
I think for me, either
Lally Bowelz or Meryl Streep.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.960
Okay. What about you?

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
I do like a lot of them,
but I like the dog.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.840
I think I relate on a spiritual
level
to Mariah Gon Trappy,

16:58.840 --> 17:01.040
who's a goody-two-shoes
that turns out to be a slut.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.960
-Yeah, okay. That is you.
-Factual.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.320
-Okay.
-Lally or Mariah.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.640
Okay.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.360
-Lally.
-[laughs]

17:09.360 --> 17:11.520
So everybody wants Lally.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.800
Everybody wants Lally Bowelz.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.120
I want it, too.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.320
I have the power to choose it,
so I'm keeping it for me.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.520
Who do you wanna be?

17:20.520 --> 17:21.720
I want Lally.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.080
Well, then she's taking it.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.760
I do Liza Minnelli on stage,

17:27.760 --> 17:30.000
I've got all the outfits,
the wigs, I do the mannerisms.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.240
I just don't see you do
that dancing, though.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.240
I don't see you do jazz.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.960
She wouldn't know Liza Minnelli

17:35.960 --> 17:37.480
if she sat on her face.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.040
[imitating Liza Minnelli]
Hello, it's me, Liza.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

in your shows, right,

in your shows, you know
where I sing in my shows,

17:51.440 --> 17:54.360

give us a little Liza.

the runt of the litter.

everybody a chance

right?

are pretty even.

have been picked,

so stuck on the Lally one

19:40.880 --> 19:43.480
[laughs]

19:43.480 --> 19:47.000
I mean, Baga is completely
a spoiled brat right now.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.720
Being the most famous woman
in Britain,

19:48.720 --> 19:50.880
I think she's used
to having her way

19:50.880 --> 19:52.680
and getting what she wants,

19:52.680 --> 19:55.960
and she's just not getting it,
and tough titties.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.280
I don't like the song,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.720
don't like the lyrics,
don't like the words.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.360
It's not going to be shit,
but all I'm saying is

20:03.360 --> 20:06.560
if I had a different role,
I would be much better.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.960
Because if I was Lally Bowelz,

20:08.960 --> 20:12.280
I would have given you
Liza on acid.

20:12.280 --> 20:16.920
Ooh, God, they boil my piss,
everyone,

20:16.920 --> 20:18.640
apart from you and Blu.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.000
Thank you.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.240
I feel really terrible,

20:21.240 --> 20:24.320
because I feel like
Baga's kind of angry.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.320
And, I don't know,
like, is this how she is?

20:27.320 --> 20:29.920
Yeah, I think it's hard
to see Baga like this.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.720
I didn't think Baga
was being serious,

20:31.720 --> 20:34.880
but I think she's really upset,

20:34.880 --> 20:36.400
and it's kind of funny.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.400
Vegan recycler.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.320
Just don't let them
get under your skin,

20:41.320 --> 20:45.280
because you and I know
we could do any one of these.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.040
It's frustrating for me to know
that Baga is so talented

20:48.040 --> 20:50.400
and she's really
letting this go to her head.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.960
And I really hope that she's
able
to pull it out in the show.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.600
Being this character,
she's addicted to hairspray,

20:55.600 --> 20:58.880
which you have been addicted
to hairspray before, right?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.640
I mean, who hasn't?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.440
Everybody has
a really great role.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.120
Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't worry.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.400
I mean, Baga's--
one thing I know about Baga

21:08.400 --> 21:10.480
is that she gets over things
pretty quickly, so--

21:10.480 --> 21:11.560
And I'm not being funny.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.240
I've seen a different side
of Juju now.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.400
I forgive, but I never forget.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.960
They should have won
the reading challenge.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.560
[laughs]

21:20.560 --> 21:23.000
And she's put me
in this very bad situation

21:23.000 --> 21:24.760
that could send me home.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.480
-Hi!
-Hi!

21:30.480 --> 21:34.000
Oh, hello, hello.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.240
Now it's time to learn the
choreography
with Strictly's Johannes.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.240
My name is Johannes Rabede,
all the way from South Africa,

21:41.240 --> 21:44.040
and I'm excited
to be here with you all.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.680
Without wasting any time,

21:46.680 --> 21:49.920
please let us start,
and we'll start with Pangina.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.480
Okay.
I had done theater before,

21:52.480 --> 21:54.720
so I'm confident
with my dancing.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.520
But the Rusical is huge,

21:56.520 --> 21:59.000
and the whole world
will be watching us,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
so pressure!

22:01.000 --> 22:02.200
I want you to come
to the front of the stage.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.480
How would you do that?
Show me.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.200
[laughs]

22:07.200 --> 22:08.880
She's old, right?

22:08.880 --> 22:11.400
She's definitely old, darling.
I love that.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.360
And then from there,
you're gonna be tapping.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.680
-Okay.
-On the step, just...

22:17.160 --> 22:18.880
It looks great.
She's doing good.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.200
Yes, sister!

22:23.200 --> 22:24.960
You will elevate that,
obviously.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.360
I will try.
[all laugh]

22:27.360 --> 22:28.760
-Okay,
-Thank you.

Tracey.

Hello!

22:32.280 --> 22:33.400
Tracey Fatberg, how are you?

22:33.400 --> 22:34.920
Tracey, luv.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.400
Ooh, I hate this role, I hate
this role,
I hate this role.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.480
I'm not gonna lie.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.840
This is a very demanding part,
actually.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.440
[exhales]

22:44.440 --> 22:49.200
I'm thinking you should
probably gimme one, two, three.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.280
Like this?

22:51.280 --> 22:54.320
[all laugh]

22:54.320 --> 22:56.840
No, Baga, I don't think so.

22:56.840 --> 22:57.960
She'd skip, wouldn't she?

22:57.960 --> 22:59.760
-No.
-Oh.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.320
There's a lot
of choreography for you.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.400
[moans]

23:03.400 --> 23:07.000
Fuck me backwards
and call me Sally.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.200
Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta,
around.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.520
Hit, hit.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.600
I think if Baga was not in
her head about not getting Liza,

23:14.600 --> 23:18.040
she probably could be doing
a better job right now.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.120
How are you feeling, baby?

23:20.120 --> 23:21.400
I'm just fucking knackered.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.920
I'm worried about Baga.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.840
I thought this was gonna be
up her alley,

23:25.840 --> 23:27.280
and it's not pulling through.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.200
Lots of work to be done, doll.
Lots of work to be done.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.240

26:17.680 --> 26:20.000
-Meryl Streep.
-Hello, hello.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.480
How are you feeling

26:21.480 --> 26:23.120
-Good. Yeah.
-Yeah?

26:23.120 --> 26:25.960
I'm thinking be Meryl.

26:25.960 --> 26:29.920
I definitely wanted to play
Liza,
because I'm a dancer.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.240
But this is a challenge.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.480
Challenge yourself.
Deal with what you get.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.800
Forget about the dancing,
the acting.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.000
You don't have to dance it,
so you can actually talk it,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.040
-You understand what I'm saying?
-But I like dancing.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.960
As a dancer, we are trained
to be very disciplined,

26:44.960 --> 26:47.000
and it's hard to let that go.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.960
So I'm looking at her,

26:48.960 --> 26:50.280
because I don't know
if she can do it.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.240
I just think it's a bit safe.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.160
It just feels
a little bit restricted.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.840
Like, I don't see freedom.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.800
You're telling me not to do
too much of the choreography.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.280
-Uh-huh.
-But that comes so naturally,

27:05.280 --> 27:07.240
so I feel like
I'm holding back.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.280
Did I set myself up here?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.440
Like, nobody wanted this shit.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.400
Like, now I understand
why nobody wanted it.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.960

27:14.960 --> 27:16.200

Last but not least, Dodo,
please join us, my darling.

27:21.960 --> 27:24.120
I'm having a little bit
of a neck issue,

27:24.120 --> 27:26.760
but I'm gonna work through it.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.320
I see.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.000
Well, suddenly someone has
a neck injury out of nowhere,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.040
so performance anxiety?

27:34.040 --> 27:36.160
[whispers]
I don't know.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.760
What is the problem?
What happened?

27:37.760 --> 27:41.920
Just my neck. My neck muscle
is just getting a bit stiff,

27:41.920 --> 27:45.040
so I can't really turn
my head that well.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.960
I slept on my neck
funny last night,

27:46.960 --> 27:49.080
and I could seize up completely,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.120
and I'm very worried
about my performance

27:52.120 --> 27:53.960
being affected by my injury.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.360
So just go through the concept

27:55.360 --> 27:56.480
and just tie it down
for yourself

27:56.480 --> 27:58.240
so that you know
what you're doing.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.040
One, two, believer.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.560
Believer comes over, right?

28:03.560 --> 28:04.960
-Yeah.
-Right?

28:04.960 --> 28:06.960
Do we need to simplify this?

28:06.960 --> 28:08.320
No, that was very simple.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.920
I know.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.160
I'm super frustrated.

28:11.160 --> 28:14.920
Johannes has had
to dumb down my choreography

28:14.920 --> 28:17.640
because of my injury,
and I feel like

28:17.640 --> 28:20.960
I'm not really able
to really give my all.

-Hey, Jimbo.
-Hey, Michelle.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.400
-Your character was Dodo.
-Yes.

48:50.400 --> 48:53.040
I felt Dodo kind of
didn't go anywhere.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.280
You kind of walked,
you did some dog things,

48:55.280 --> 48:56.320
and that was it.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.480
I was kind of upset

48:57.480 --> 48:59.000
at how long the basket
was in front of your face

48:59.000 --> 49:00.320
when you started singing,

49:00.320 --> 49:02.120
because it's not like
the reveal was that shocking.

49:02.120 --> 49:04.040
We knew you were a dog,
you know what I mean?

49:05.240 --> 49:08.120
Because I knew Jimbo
was in that dog,

49:08.120 --> 49:09.720
I don't know,
I was just expecting more.

49:09.720 --> 49:12.280
I felt Jimbo got a bit lost.

49:13.400 --> 49:16.040
-Hi, Jimbo.
-Hi, Jonathan. Oh, wow.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.600
[laughs] For me, it was
a bit of a mixed bag.

49:18.600 --> 49:21.240
I feel like your first lyric was
about
being trapped in a basket,

49:21.240 --> 49:22.280
and I felt like you were trapped

49:22.280 --> 49:23.720
in that characterization
in the outfit.

49:23.720 --> 49:28.000
What we wanted to see
was half you, half the choreo.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.840
That's why I say you learn it
and then throw it out.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.520
That's what the challenge
is about,

49:32.520 --> 49:34.880
and it just didn't seem like
the two came together.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.960
But you look gorgeous tonight.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.960
The commitment to it,

49:38.960 --> 49:41.560
you come out
and you strike this pose,

49:41.560 --> 49:43.800
and it's like you're in
a life art drawing class.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.920
You are presenting it
throughout.

49:51.160 --> 49:54.400
So you were Lally Bowelz.

49:54.400 --> 49:57.080
You did the choreography.
I think you did it well,

49:57.080 --> 50:00.080
but I think what was missing
were those moments.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.680
We all wanted Liza,
and we didn't get Liza.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.080
We were waiting for
that really big Liza stuff,

50:06.080 --> 50:08.120
the terrific, the ta-ta-ta.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.080
So it's like, unh! Ha!

50:10.080 --> 50:12.160
Just never got there.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.080
You just came out
and performed it

50:15.080 --> 50:18.440
without kind of injecting
extra jokes in it,

50:18.440 --> 50:19.800
so that was a shame.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.600
It wasn't as entertaining
as it could have been,

50:22.600 --> 50:23.920
but you looked incredible.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.920
But it was a bit candor
and low-ebb.

50:26.920 --> 50:29.320
Tonight, this, for me, is cute,

50:29.320 --> 50:32.440
but this is inflatable snakes
stuck to a dress.

50:32.440 --> 50:35.520
Not enough for me
on this platform.

50:35.520 --> 50:36.600
There's something
about the tights

50:36.600 --> 50:39.000
that are just the wrong shade.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.040
The shoes, amazing.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.800
You look a little bit
like you've fallen

50:42.800 --> 50:45.000
into the shallow end
of a children's pool party.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.320
But it's a good vibe.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.560
It's adorable, it looks
Club Kid, it fits the brief.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.320
But you've been getting
the exact same critique,

50:53.320 --> 50:57.320
which is have you arrived yet,
or what's going on with Juju.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.880
I'm afraid I have to say
I'm just really sorry.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.200
You did what was asked of you,

51:01.200 --> 51:03.800
but you didn't take it
to the Juju level,

51:03.800 --> 51:05.920
and we have expectations of you

51:05.920 --> 51:09.080
that, you know, just haven't
been
quite reached yet.

51:09.080 --> 51:11.000
Give it to us all the way.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.520
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

51:12.520 --> 51:13.920
All right, thanks, Juju.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.480
Thank you.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.400
Up next, Janey Jack.

51:18.400 --> 51:22.520
I really, really enjoyed
your Meryl Streep.

51:22.520 --> 51:26.000
All of the lyrics in this
entire Rusical were hilarious,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.640
but you just
lip synced perfectly.

51:28.640 --> 51:32.560
You gave just enough
for us to laugh.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.240
Yeah, I was really impressed,
because, you know,

51:34.240 --> 51:37.120
there's nothing inherently funny
about Meryl Streep.

51:37.120 --> 51:41.160
You did capture that slight
smugness she can have,

51:41.160 --> 51:42.880
and I thought you did that
brilliantly.

51:42.880 --> 51:44.200
Character work,
completely impeccable.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.840
Things like her hands
in her pocket.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.080
There was just real details.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.120
I could see that
you put lots of work in.

51:50.120 --> 51:53.160
And I think every single one
of Meryl Streep's 21 nominations

51:53.160 --> 51:54.280
I saw in your performance.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.800
I loved it.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.800
There was a certain ease that
you had
when you took the stage.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.120
Did not see you working out
the choreography.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.320
It just felt so effortless.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.960
This tonight,
you look gorgeous,

52:05.960 --> 52:07.600
but there's something
about the dress.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.160
I think there's something
from the waist down

52:10.160 --> 52:11.320
that's gone wrong.

52:11.320 --> 52:14.080
I thought you were really
chic and sophisticated

52:14.080 --> 52:15.240
in this outfit.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.880
I wanted to see
a little bit more shoulder,

52:16.880 --> 52:18.360
I wanted that line
to be lower a little bit.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.840
Slut.
[all laugh]

52:20.840 --> 52:23.440
-Thank you, Janey.
-Thank you, Mama Ru.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.960
Mo' money, Mo Heart.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.400
-Hello!
-Hey, Mo!

52:27.400 --> 52:31.000
Dr. Spank-N-Spurter.
You definitely had fun with it.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.320
It just could have gone further.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.080
You slipped in the cartwheel.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.600
Don't let your face tell us.

52:36.600 --> 52:39.000
You basically told us,
y'all, I just fucked up.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.200
We see that.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.720
It's true.
You know, when you slip

52:42.720 --> 52:45.440
and you get a little
frustrated with yourself,

52:45.440 --> 52:48.120
we see everything.
We see it all.

52:48.120 --> 52:51.080
I really understand what it is
to be frustrated,

52:51.080 --> 52:52.960
but you're just
so bloody brilliant.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.720
You got back up,
and, you know, that took balls,

52:55.720 --> 52:58.120
and balls and Frankenfurter is
what we judges always look for.

52:58.120 --> 53:01.000
-Mmm.
-Tonight, you look sensational.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.040
I love this, the color palette,
your makeup.

53:05.040 --> 53:07.320
It's so beautiful.
It's great.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.520
I get it. It's one of
my favorite Pixar movies.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.040
It's beautiful,
that corset is gorgeous.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.520
But when I watch you
when you're standing up here,

53:15.520 --> 53:16.760
you look like
you are shitting your pants.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.120
So just, Mo, push yourself

53:19.120 --> 53:21.440
and keep challenging yourself,

53:21.440 --> 53:22.720
because you've got the goods.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.240
I've wanted to come out
and give it.

53:24.240 --> 53:29.120
I felt it and just to
totally, like, losing it,

53:29.120 --> 53:31.880
and you just gotta pull it in,
and I didn't.

53:31.880 --> 53:38.040
But if I do get a lovely
chance to stay, please,

53:38.040 --> 53:40.960
I surely will show the hell up.
Thank you very much.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.520
-You got it, girl.
-Got it, girl.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.400
Up next, Pangina Heals.

53:46.400 --> 53:47.440
Hi!

53:47.440 --> 53:49.120
Widdle Orphan Fannie.

53:49.120 --> 53:53.120
So the minute you came out,
it was just a production.

53:53.120 --> 53:55.960
The character development, tick.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.680
Lip sync, tick.

53:57.680 --> 54:00.400
And it was so fun to watch.

54:00.400 --> 54:03.080
I believed that's Little Orphan
Annie
50 years later.

54:03.080 --> 54:06.000
I do, and you owned it.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.080
Yeah, congratulations.

54:07.080 --> 54:10.520
I mean, you really kicked
the show off brilliantly.

54:10.520 --> 54:13.320
Just the way you wore the dress,

54:13.320 --> 54:15.720
you were Orphan Fannie
throughout.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.840
I think you were limping
on the wrong leg.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.360
Oh!
[all laugh]

54:20.360 --> 54:22.560
You had a bandage
on your supporting leg,

54:22.560 --> 54:24.280
and you indicated that
as your bad leg,

54:24.280 --> 54:25.880
but that was the one
that was leading the way.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.240
So perhaps you need a little
Daniel Day-Lewis My Left Foot

54:29.240 --> 54:30.280
to get you going.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.280
Yeah, I thought
it was brilliant.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.000
It was kind of frightening, too,

54:33.000 --> 54:36.480
because it's like looking
in a mirror, you know?

54:36.480 --> 54:38.400
It's like, is that
what's gonna happen to me?

54:38.400 --> 54:40.200
If it happened to Michelle,
it can happen to me.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.800
-Oh, true.
-You know?

54:41.800 --> 54:44.960
[all laugh]

54:48.440 --> 54:49.640
This, tonight,

54:49.640 --> 54:51.160
is one of my favorite
school science experiments.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.080
[all laugh]

54:53.080 --> 54:54.800
It's fashiony,
but it's also fun.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.080
I would wear that print.
I love it.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.120
It looks a bit like

54:58.120 --> 54:59.840
you've had an accident
with a gumball machine.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.960
But I'm gonna go with it,
because we all love candy.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.480
You didn't lose yourself in it.
We still see you.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.320
Your makeup's
really cool tonight.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.040
Your body shape looks gorgeous.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.080
Another strong night for you,
Pangina.

55:09.080 --> 55:10.400
-Thank you.
-Keep it up.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.560
You set the bar very high.

55:11.560 --> 55:12.920
Thank you.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.080
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

55:16.080 --> 55:19.960
Based on the judges' critiques,
I've made some decisions.

55:21.040 --> 55:24.040
Janey Jack.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.760
Pangina Heals.

55:25.760 --> 55:26.920
Con-drag-ulations.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.320
You are the top two queens
of the week.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.960
Thank you.
[applause]

55:32.960 --> 55:34.120
Mo Heart.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.200
You are safe.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.480
Thank you.

55:43.480 --> 55:46.760
That means Jimbo and Jujubee,

55:46.760 --> 55:53.040
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are in the bottom two.

55:53.040 --> 55:57.120
Janey, Pangina,
each of you needs to decide

55:57.120 --> 56:00.400
which of the bottom two
you would eliminate

56:00.400 --> 56:03.400
if you win the lip sync.

56:03.400 --> 56:06.680
So while you queens deliberate
in the werkroom,

56:06.680 --> 56:08.960
the judges and I will have...

56:10.920 --> 56:12.000
Afternoon tea.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.880
You may leave the stage.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.840
Thank you so much.

56:18.120 --> 56:20.600
-Whew! We're back!
-Oh, my God,

56:20.600 --> 56:22.720
I can't believe it.

56:22.720 --> 56:27.800
I am back in Untucked,
and I'm feeling great.

56:27.800 --> 56:31.080
Well, hats off to you girls.
You did a good job.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.680
[all laugh]

56:32.680 --> 56:34.880
I feel on top of the world.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.760
We both have a badge.

56:36.760 --> 56:38.000
We're both in the run
for another one.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.520
I feel like
I rose to the challenge,

56:40.520 --> 56:43.440
and I can't believe it
that I'm second week top two.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.680
Like, it's great.

56:44.680 --> 56:46.480
What about you, Baga?
How are you?

56:46.480 --> 56:49.560
Yeah, I did feel like
I had the last of the pickings

56:49.560 --> 56:52.480
when it came to the characters,
I really do.

56:52.480 --> 56:58.080
I was left with that one,
and I'm just happy to be safe.

56:58.080 --> 57:02.680
I delivered Tracey...
what's the name?

57:05.640 --> 57:07.160
Can I address the elephant
in the room, Baga?

57:07.160 --> 57:10.920
I love you so much, but,
like, your tantrum, though,

57:10.920 --> 57:12.640
it brought the room down, girl.

57:12.640 --> 57:16.120
Well, I wanted Juju's part.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.480
We have to do things
that we don't like, babe.

57:18.480 --> 57:22.320
I just feel like you're not
showing
a full team player.

57:22.320 --> 57:25.520
Like, the Baga Chipz
experience is real

57:25.520 --> 57:27.160
until you get a challenge
that it's just, like,

57:27.160 --> 57:29.840
"It's not what I want,
so I'm not doing it."

57:29.840 --> 57:32.120
I just feel like it's everyone
versus Baga now.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.280
-No, it's not, it's not!
-No, but it's not.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.480
We are all on the same team.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.000
We're all here together,

57:37.000 --> 57:40.040
but we want you to stay
on that team as well.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.200
I agree. I think I've been
a bit of a spoiled brat, and--

57:42.200 --> 57:44.480
Yeah. Lovely. Praise God.
She gets it.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.200
I've gotta stop overthinking,

57:46.200 --> 57:49.320
and I've gotta just get up
and get on with it

57:49.320 --> 57:50.960
instead of moaning.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.840
-Can we hug you now?
-Yeah.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.520
I just wanna apologize
if I've affected anybody's--

57:54.520 --> 57:56.040
No, thank you
for your apologies.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.040
We love you.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.600
I think she's
a big enough person

57:58.600 --> 58:03.320
to be, like, I apologize,
and that takes real character.

58:05.800 --> 58:06.840
Jujubee, how are you feeling?

58:11.040 --> 58:13.800
I actually thought
I did pretty good.

58:13.800 --> 58:15.000
Me, too.

58:17.120 --> 58:18.600
I chose the part

58:18.600 --> 58:20.960
because I knew it was gonna be
a challenge for myself,

58:20.960 --> 58:25.000
and I just
missed the mark again.

58:26.160 --> 58:28.560
I've felt this feeling before.

58:28.560 --> 58:32.040
I think on Season 2, I was in
the bottom
three weeks in a row,

58:32.040 --> 58:34.120
you know, and I lip synced
my way out of it.

58:34.120 --> 58:35.280
But this time,

58:35.280 --> 58:37.000
I'm not lip syncing
my way out of this.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.120
Ugh.

58:39.120 --> 58:40.720
Well, you're not alone
in the bottom two.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.240
Jimbo, how do you feel?

58:42.240 --> 58:43.360
Pblblblblt.

58:43.360 --> 58:48.160
Oh, God, I am so bummed.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.440
You know, Mama Ru saying

58:50.440 --> 58:52.640
ignore the choreographer
that's brought in...

58:54.680 --> 58:56.640
It's hard for me
to just say, yeah,

58:56.640 --> 58:59.320
like, I'm gonna ditch that
choreo
during a choreo challenge.

59:01.040 --> 59:03.120
That's not what the judges said.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.200
Nobody said it was
a choreography challenge.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.480
It's a Rusical.

59:06.480 --> 59:08.880
That means you have to be able
to do the choreography,

59:08.880 --> 59:11.320
but make it look natural,
like you didn't study it,

59:11.320 --> 59:14.440
and you have to put in
the personality you're playing.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.400
This challenge
was about trying to embody

59:16.400 --> 59:22.560
this half-Dodo, half-Dorothy,
half-Jimbo
choreo challenge.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.280
I am in shock.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.960
Two weeks in a row
I've been in the top,

59:25.960 --> 59:28.200
and now all of a sudden
I'm in the bottom.

59:28.200 --> 59:32.080
I'm surprised that Mama Ru
doesn't at least make me safe,

59:32.080 --> 59:34.800
knowing that
I have overcome an injury

59:34.800 --> 59:35.960
and that I've tried my best.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.040
I should have just,
like Ru said,

59:38.040 --> 59:42.120
ignored everything
and done whatever I wanted.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.000
I do believe that Jimbo should
have
been in the bottom two.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.440
But do I want Jimbo
to be in the bottom two?

59:47.440 --> 59:49.080
No, Jimbo is my best friend.

59:49.080 --> 59:51.680
But unfortunately,
he didn't excel.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.280
Let's go speak to the two girls.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.400
I would like to take Juju,
if I may.

59:56.400 --> 59:57.800
Sure. I'll talk to Jimbo.

59:57.800 --> 1:00:00.480
Right now
there's a lot of emotions,

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:02.920
but I have decisions to make.

1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:08.120
All I can say is
I had to combine being a dog,

1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:11.320
being Dorothy, being beautiful,
learning choreo.

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:14.240
I also had to navigate
having a neck injury.

1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:18.120
I have so much invested
in this emotionally

1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:21.320
in terms of what I wanna do,
what I wanna show,

1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:23.600
what I wanna learn,
what I wanna bring.

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:26.720
Breathe, Jimbo. Calm down.

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:29.480
You're just going on and on
and on and on,

1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:34.040
but I know how badly
she wants to be here, so I get
it.

1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:36.960
I know that Juju is an icon
and a legend,

1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:40.640
but this is her second time
in the bottom.

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.720
-Yeah.
-It seems like she's given up.

1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:45.080
She is deflated,
and I'm just wondering

1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:47.800
who has the dots
to send her home.

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:51.000
I want to be here so badly.

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.000
I know.

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.040
And I will do whatever
you want me to do.

1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:56.360
I will do anything.

1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:58.040
You can have my lunch, you can
have the rest of my drink,

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:00.120
you can have my small umbrella.

1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:02.040
I will do everything.

1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:09.600
I just wish that
I could hit all the marks

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:12.200
that the judges wanted
out of me.

1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:16.280
Do you, at this point,
feel like you've lost your
fight?

1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:18.480
No!

1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:21.320
When I'm in drag, I feel like
I'm doing something right.

1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:24.000
I'm scared.

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.040
I didn't come all this way
to go home now.

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:31.240
I do wanna remind you that
when Jimbo was in the top,

1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:35.720
he chose my lipstick
and he chose another lipstick,

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:36.880
and that was yours.

1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:38.560
-I know.
-So...

1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:40.120
I mean, she's right,

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:43.080
but would me
choosing Jimbo's lipstick

1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:46.200
be the same shady,
nasty game Jimbo played?

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.520
I feel for Juju.

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.440
She's been in the bottom twice.

1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:53.560
Now, that is the thing.

1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:55.000
Jimbo's been in the top twice.

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.120
I love Jimbo, but, like,
I don't trust him,

1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:00.840
because if you made an alliance
and then you broke it--

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.000
It's hard, because
Jimbo made his bed,

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.840
so now does he lie in it?

1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:09.520
I don't know how
to explain to everybody

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:12.360
that, like, the fight
will always be in me.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:13.880
Juju has done this before,

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:17.320
so it's a little bit frustrating
that she's not bringing it.

1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:19.440
She needs to be in this game,

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:23.080
and she needs to pick herself
back up
in order to prove it.

1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:26.120
Why do you deserve to stay
over Jimbo?

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:28.720
I think I went above and beyond.

1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:30.040
So you did better
in the challenge?

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.760
-I think so.
-Okay.

1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:34.360
I want you to tell me

1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:36.280
the choices you made
with the lipsticks.

1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:39.920
I understand my moment,
but what happened with Juju,

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:42.800
where you created an alliance
and went behind her back--

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.080
No, I didn't create an alliance.

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:45.840
What I did was
I said the same thing

1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:48.320
that you're going to say to me,
the same thing

1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:51.440
that everybody says to anybody
in this position,

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.040
is if I save you,
will you save me?

1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:55.680
I'm gonna correct you,

1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:57.280
because I have never said that.

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:58.520
Well--

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.000
I didn't say that to you now,

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.680
and I did not say that
to Juju last week.

1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:03.560
You want your sisters
to have your back.

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:05.000
If you can't show the front,

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.960
they will never
have your back, bitch.

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.240
I'm playing the game
like everyone plays the game,

1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:12.400
and I am really
wanting to be here.

1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:16.160
I haven't held anything back,
and I need another chance.

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:19.080
I want to be here
so fucking badly,

1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:21.400
and I'm so disappointed
that I'm in the bottom

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:22.840
and that I'm having
to beg for my life.

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:25.400
And I really hope

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:30.120
that you will take the whole
competition
into consideration.

1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:33.760
I appreciate your realness,
your honesty, and your fight,

1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:36.000
and I think everything you said

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.440
proves enough,
you know, on your part.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:42.560
But I also really sympathize,
of course, with Juju,

1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:45.480
who I saved last week
and who I saw herself pushing.

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:47.360
So it's just really hard.

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:53.400
[gentle, refined music playing]

1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:16.520
[slurps]

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:24.200
I'm really torn
between these two choices,

1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:26.040
these two beautiful queens.

1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:28.640
We have Jimbo,
this incredible talent,

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.200
but who is not being
100% fully true with himself

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:33.480
and the choices that he makes.

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.760
We have Jujubee,
who seems to be sort of lost,

1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:39.640
but really hungry in that she
wants
to win this time around.

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:43.000
Hard. Very hard choice.

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:47.520
Having been a judge before,

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:51.040
I am basing my decision
on the here and the now.

1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:54.600
Who is rising to the occasion
with this challenge?

1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:00.240
My decision is very clear.

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:02.680
The person that I wanna keep

1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:05.240
is the person
that has more to give.

1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:13.120
Welcome back, ladies.

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:17.280
Two internationally acclaimed
queens
stand before me.

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:22.960
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:28.080
and earn the power to give one
of the bottom queens le chop.

1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:33.960
We both have a RuPeter badge,
so this can go any way.

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.520
But I wanna win.

1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:38.040

if you can't love yourself,

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:44.680
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:46.160
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:47.680
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:48.680

Welcome, Katie Price.

1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:12.000
Thanks for having me.
I'm so excited.

1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.320
When you walked out,

You really are a lucky lady,

1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:19.000
