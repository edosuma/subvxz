What,
are you smoking now?

39:44.824 --> 39:48.092
Drinking in the middle
of the day?

39:48.228 --> 39:51.162
It's been a rough one.

39:51.197 --> 39:54.565
Rough couple of days since
you've been gone, actually.

39:54.667 --> 39:57.902
What's going on?

39:58.004 --> 39:59.203
Donna's missing.

39:59.239 --> 40:01.706
Donna?
What, next-door Donna?

40:01.741 --> 40:03.975
Jack called the police.

40:04.010 --> 40:05.510
He has no idea
where she is.

40:05.545 --> 40:06.878
She...

40:06.913 --> 40:09.280
might've run off
with another man.

40:09.416 --> 40:11.516
What makes you
say that?

40:11.551 --> 40:13.117
Jack.

40:13.253 --> 40:15.453
I guess they had
a lot of problems.

40:15.588 --> 40:18.289
A lot of secrets.

40:18.358 --> 40:20.525
But we don't have secrets
anymore, do we?

40:22.729 --> 40:25.797
Problems?
-Mimi, we are fine.

40:25.932 --> 40:27.632
I told you, I want us to be
on the same page.

40:27.767 --> 40:30.301
But you still haven't told me
everything that's going on!

40:30.370 --> 40:35.306
Because I just --
I don't even know myself.

40:35.442 --> 40:37.041
Are we in danger?

40:39.279 --> 40:40.545
We are, aren't we?

40:40.580 --> 40:43.147
No, not anymore.

40:43.283 --> 40:45.583
I'm going to fix things.

40:45.618 --> 40:47.151
Fix things where?

40:47.287 --> 40:48.519
Because home is what's broken
right now,

40:48.555 --> 40:50.588
Allen,
and we can't keep doing this.

40:50.623 --> 40:53.758
<i> I</i> can't keep
doing this.

40:53.793 --> 40:56.060
What are you saying?

40:56.095 --> 40:57.829
Project Blue Book.

40:57.964 --> 40:59.831
Your job.

40:59.966 --> 41:02.600
You need to make a choice,
and now.
