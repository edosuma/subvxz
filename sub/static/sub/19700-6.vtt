ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.014 --> 00:16.016

00:20.754 --> 00:24.325
When I put those clothes on...

00:24.358 --> 00:26.594
something happens to me.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.732
Something...

00:31.765 --> 00:33.234
frightening.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.236
(screaming)

00:35.269 --> 00:38.239
(dramatic orchestral music
playing)

00:38.272 --> 00:41.942
Oh, God, no!

00:46.280 --> 00:48.516
NARRATOR: Strait-Jacket
mounts to a crescendo

00:48.549 --> 00:50.751
of electrifying suspense.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.087
Sinister. Frightening.
(gasps)

00:53.121 --> 00:57.591
Joan Crawford in a shattering
screen portrayal.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.959
Leave me alone!

00:58.992 --> 01:00.528
You let go of me!

01:00.561 --> 01:02.763
You listen to me!

01:02.796 --> 01:04.132
Just call me, Lucille.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.933
I wouldn't like my
little girl to think

01:05.966 --> 01:08.436
I was trying to take
her fella away from her.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.105
Carol and Michael
are going to be married,

01:11.139 --> 01:13.307
and nobody's gonna stop it.

01:13.341 --> 01:17.278
NARRATOR: Ingeniously designed
to shock and startle,

01:17.311 --> 01:19.447
Strait-Jacket
may go beyond the limits

01:19.480 --> 01:22.116
of your ability
to endure suspense.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.118
Mother!

01:24.152 --> 01:25.653
He's gone.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.123
Oh, my God!

01:29.157 --> 01:32.059
NARRATOR: The author
of the famed novel Psycho,

01:32.092 --> 01:35.896
the director of the wildly
acclaimed chiller Homicidal,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.999
the costar of
What Ever Happened to Baby Jane,

01:39.032 --> 01:42.136
join forces to create
a frightening classic

01:42.170 --> 01:44.138
of shock and suspense.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.174
(suspenseful music playing)

01:50.678 --> 01:53.381
(crowd cheering)

01:57.518 --> 01:58.819
ANNOUNCER:
Direct from Hollywood,

01:58.852 --> 02:02.523
that master of suspense,
Mr. William Castle!

02:04.525 --> 02:07.761
CASTLE: Good evening,
my murderous minions.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.397
(crowd cheering)

02:18.306 --> 02:19.940
I'm William Castle,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.443
the director of the picture
you're about to see.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.878
Be warned,
Strait-Jacket contains

02:24.912 --> 02:27.381
the most realistic portrayal

02:27.415 --> 02:30.184
of axe murders
in motion picture history,

02:30.218 --> 02:33.854
made all the more vivid
by the powerful performance

02:33.887 --> 02:35.523
of a screen legend.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.559
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star of Strait-Jacket,

02:38.592 --> 02:41.362
Miss Joan Crawford.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.363
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

02:42.396 --> 02:43.797
CASTLE:
Oh, no.

02:43.831 --> 02:48.369
Don't panic, but-but a madwoman
is loose in this theater!

02:48.402 --> 02:51.071
(crowd gasps, cheers)

03:01.582 --> 03:03.917
(cheering continues)

03:17.931 --> 03:19.233
CASTLE:
No.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.868
(crowd gasping)

03:23.604 --> 03:25.839
No, no, please.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.375
(laughter, cheering)

03:30.544 --> 03:32.780
(crowd gasps, shrieks)

03:34.948 --> 03:37.285
(crowd cheering)

03:39.953 --> 03:42.189
Miss Joan Crawford!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.224
(crowd cheering loudly)

03:47.461 --> 03:49.430
(microphone feedback hums)
Thank you.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.266
I hope you will approve
of our little picture,

03:52.300 --> 03:55.703
and please, enjoy a refreshing

03:55.736 --> 03:58.806
Pepsi Cola at the
concession stand.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.108
A-And now,
before the show begins,

04:01.141 --> 04:03.711
a little something
to protect all of you.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.947
Ladies? Ladies? Come on.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.982
(crowd whistles, cheers)

04:09.016 --> 04:10.718
JOAN (quietly):
What the hell is this?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.119
You said no
more gimmicks.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.289
Well, do you want a hit,
Joan, or don't you?

04:15.323 --> 04:18.492
(cheering continues)

04:20.528 --> 04:22.530
*

04:26.534 --> 04:28.669
(cheering fades)

04:33.006 --> 04:36.009
MAMACITA: Home again,
home again, jiggedy jog,

04:36.043 --> 04:38.579
we put you to bed.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.180
JOAN:
I need a drink.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.582
MAMACITA:
Don't you think you had

04:41.615 --> 04:42.916
enough to drink on the plane?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.985
Hey, you are not my keeper.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.388
You're a servant;
don't ever forget that.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.925
I don't think I can do it
anymore, Mamacita.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.328
New Mexico this weekend,

04:54.362 --> 04:55.529
then the tour is done.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.665
Oh, New Mexico.
Jesus Christ!

04:57.698 --> 05:00.000
Why did I say yes
to any of this?

05:00.033 --> 05:03.003
Why did you?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.338
(groans)

05:04.372 --> 05:06.674
No offers
in nine months.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.609
Huh?

05:08.642 --> 05:12.179
I had to take it just to
keep the goddamn lights on.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.847
Look, Miss Joan.

05:13.881 --> 05:14.848
(lighter clicks)

05:14.882 --> 05:16.450
Flowers.
Yeah?

05:16.484 --> 05:17.851
From whom?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.388
Mr. George Cukor.

05:20.421 --> 05:24.191
"Congratulating you
on your latest success."

05:24.224 --> 05:26.059
My latest success,
what a joke.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.696
He's five years
older than me,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.731
and he's hotter
than he's ever been.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.966
He's winning awards
for My Fair Lady,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.036
I'm pimping myself out
to William Castle.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.873
The picture is doing very well.
People are coming to see you.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.310
People are coming to see
blood and gore

05:43.343 --> 05:45.546
and heads being chopped off!

05:45.579 --> 05:48.516
They're not coming to see me,
you stupid croak!

05:52.285 --> 05:53.887
(sobs)

05:53.921 --> 05:56.657
(sobbing):
Oh, God.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.059
I'm sorry, Mamacita.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.061
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.163
I am sorry!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.331
You're always sorry!

06:04.364 --> 06:05.899
You're crazy,

06:05.933 --> 06:07.568
but you do it!

06:07.601 --> 06:09.269
I tell you now this:

06:09.302 --> 06:11.572
the next time you throw
something at my head,

06:11.605 --> 06:14.041
I leave you.
Then you will have nothing!

06:16.777 --> 06:18.579
Good night.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.114
(Joan cries softly)

06:23.383 --> 06:26.086
Careful going up the stairs.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.456
You are blotto.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.690
(whimpers)

06:29.723 --> 06:31.725
*

06:49.309 --> 06:52.079
*

07:23.343 --> 07:26.346
*

07:52.540 --> 07:55.242
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

08:13.561 --> 08:16.697
Box office numbers, Mr. Warner.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.465
What's with the guard?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.734
Are you afraid
I'm gonna kill the messenger?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.703
Oh, I'm not security, sir.
DENNIS: This is Bart,

08:22.736 --> 08:24.705
our new trainee.
He forgot his sport coat,

08:24.738 --> 08:26.640
so they gave him a
loaner at the gate.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.075
Ah. Uh-huh.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.377
Well, your parents
must be very proud.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.980
Son of a bitch.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.649
Strait-Jacket did 2.5 million?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.050
Is that not good?
Yeah, it's great

08:37.084 --> 08:38.051
if you're Harry Cohn.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.219
It's Columbia Pictures.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.588
And Lady in a Cage
is on track

08:40.621 --> 08:42.255
to do even better.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.757
I heard that's supposed to
be an excellent picture.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.658
That's Paramount.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.993
Quick, Biff...

08:46.026 --> 08:47.260
Bart.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.396
What is it about these
hag movies that people love?

08:49.429 --> 08:52.232
I don't know, my-my mom says
that they're kind of degrading.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.002
Bingo. Degradation.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.436
That's what it is.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.072
You take some
movie queen of yore,

08:59.106 --> 09:01.942
who was once
too beautiful to screw us

09:01.975 --> 09:03.977
and you make her suffer.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.749
Tearing down your idols.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.918
It's very satisfying
for an audience.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.185
Don't you think, Bob?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.121
Bart.
Goddamn it!

09:14.154 --> 09:16.123
I created this genre!

09:16.156 --> 09:19.593
Hagsploitation!
It even has its own word!

09:19.627 --> 09:20.861
And you know
who came up with that?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.396
The New York Times.
No! Me!

09:24.798 --> 09:27.367
Get me Bob Aldrich in my office.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.270
Are you sure?

09:30.303 --> 09:33.040
Am I sure? What the...

09:33.073 --> 09:35.075
You banned him
from the lot.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.449
Switch jackets.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.217
Sir?

09:44.251 --> 09:47.387
You take off your jacket
and you give it to Bart,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.323
and then you put on his.

09:52.492 --> 09:56.296
Now, show Bart
how to dial Bob Aldrich,

09:56.329 --> 09:59.132
then go down to the front gate

09:59.166 --> 10:03.036
and tell them that you are
the new security guard.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.879
DENNIS:
Right.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.848
Nice to meet you, Bart.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.516
Great. Yes, sir,
such a pleasure.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.551
Thank you so much.
Mm-hmm.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.690
(doorbell rings)

10:30.030 --> 10:31.364
Please be brief.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.867
She must conserve her energy
for Albuquerque.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.403
Is she crossing the desert
on foot?

10:38.706 --> 10:40.708
JOAN:
Oh, Hedda, darling.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.011
I don't have a
quiet minute today.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.514
I have to convert this
dust bowl look to a desert look

10:47.547 --> 10:51.852
and work out this awful crick
in my neck, and then

10:51.885 --> 10:55.555
back on the road for that
goddamn Lizzie Borden routine.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.692
You're not having a gay old time
greeting fans coast to coast?

10:58.726 --> 10:59.727
(chuckles)

10:59.760 --> 11:01.895
Does a Ringling Brothers
elephant

11:01.929 --> 11:03.797
have a gay old time?

11:03.831 --> 11:04.832
(chuckles)

11:06.666 --> 11:08.135
Hedda?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.402
Hedda, what is it?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.471
Did you skip lunch?
Do you want...

11:11.504 --> 11:13.974
No.
...me to get Mamacita
to boil you an egg?

11:14.007 --> 11:18.145
No, no, just-just sit with me.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.546
Hedda,

11:19.579 --> 11:22.382
are you all right?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.417
(sighs)

11:26.453 --> 11:29.222
Oh... hmm.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.891
(sighs)

11:30.924 --> 11:33.160
Last week...

11:33.193 --> 11:36.429
I was on the phone
with Frances Marion,

11:36.463 --> 11:41.334
deploring the demise
of the tender love story,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.403
when my arm went dead.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.572
Limp like a stewed noodle.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.007
Oh...

11:47.040 --> 11:49.076
It was a heart attack.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.245
I have a defect,
apparently.

11:52.279 --> 11:56.183
And the doctor says it won't be
long before another one hits.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.118
Come on, Hedda.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.586
Get up. Let me...

11:59.619 --> 12:01.421
We'll sit somewhere
more comfortable.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.923
Thank you, darling.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.359
Why, why, why
didn't you call me?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.429
Oh, no, I used
the time to reflect.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.364
(laughs softly)

12:11.398 --> 12:17.871
If I am finished, and the sum
of my life's work is tallied,

12:17.905 --> 12:20.307
am I satisfied?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.709
With reams of gossip?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.611
Oh, how can
you say that?

12:24.644 --> 12:26.146
(laughs)

12:26.179 --> 12:29.449
Look at all the careers
that you have launched.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.451
Mine included.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.288
I didn't muse
on the careers I'd nurtured.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.791
I thought about
the ones I destroyed.

12:37.825 --> 12:41.128
The reds, the queers,
the whores,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.831
the cheaters and dopeheads.

12:43.864 --> 12:49.402
The ones who cursed me,
sued me, offed themselves.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.504
And I felt...

12:53.673 --> 12:55.642
...good.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.812
That I'd contributed
to our moral economy.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.513
And so you have.

13:00.547 --> 13:05.085
You have been nothing
short of a bulwark

13:05.118 --> 13:10.190
against the tide of smut
crashing over this culture.

13:10.223 --> 13:14.962
But I can't stop it
lapping at your door.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.834
What are you
talking about?

13:20.868 --> 13:23.503
Somebody's been shopping
a stag picture

13:23.536 --> 13:27.274
in which you allegedly appeared,
in your youth.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.009
(laughs)

13:29.042 --> 13:31.678
Well, that is ridiculous.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.947
It must be someone
who resembles me.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.450
I know Louella's
been sniffing around.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.119
So has Confidential.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.854
Bastards.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.456
Can I sue?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.125
Not if there's a film.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.960
Is there, Joan?

13:46.994 --> 13:50.197
Why would you ask that?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.465
Because if there is,
I'll find out.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.068
I always find out.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.375
And you would
write about it.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.677
It's what I do.

14:17.024 --> 14:21.561
I'm offering you the opportunity
to add your voice to the story.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.231
By telling
the tale of shame yourself,

14:24.264 --> 14:27.935
you can turn it
into a story of redemption.

14:27.968 --> 14:31.238
Not a bad way for
either of us to go out.

14:31.271 --> 14:36.376
The perfect final scoop
for my readers.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.916
I am sorry about
your ill health, Hedda.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.284
(chuckles)

14:44.317 --> 14:48.288
And I am sorry that
it has so weakened

14:48.321 --> 14:52.592
your ability to distinguish
truth from lies.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.595
(sighs)

14:55.628 --> 14:57.297
All right, Joan.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.468
But just remember.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.973
It's always better to cooperate.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.485
(Robert and Harriet
moaning)

15:18.518 --> 15:20.453
(groans)

15:20.487 --> 15:21.888
(sighs)

15:21.921 --> 15:24.824
Oh, goddamn it.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.893
I think I drank too much.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.130
All right.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.132
Time to talk.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.402
I don't think talking about it
improves its performance any.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.471
I'm not talking about "it,"
I'm talking about you.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.507
You're morose.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.808
You've been morose.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.144
You wear slippers
to lunch.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.813
And you smashed all of
my Sinatra records.

15:46.846 --> 15:50.250
Yeah, I thought it'd make me
feel better, but it didn't.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.319
You know, I knew
4 for Texas was gonna stink,

15:52.352 --> 15:54.154
even before Sinatra
shit all over it.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.156
Then what'd you go
through with it for?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.091
Because Jack Warner thought
it was a bad idea,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.659
and I didn't want
to give that prick

15:59.692 --> 16:01.694
the satisfaction
of being right.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.663
You know what I think?

16:03.696 --> 16:06.333
All this gloom isn't
about your last flop.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.834
It's about your last hit.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.369
What?

16:09.402 --> 16:11.204
I think the fact
that Bob Aldrich

16:11.238 --> 16:13.840
had his biggest success
with a woman's picture,

16:13.873 --> 16:16.676
well, I think it's
knocked you off-balance.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.378
Ah, Harriet...

16:18.411 --> 16:20.947
You have to stop moping
around the house.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.715
It's not good for you.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.884
It's time to decide what it is
that you want to do,

16:24.917 --> 16:26.553
and then do it.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.123
Even if Jack Warner
does think it's a good idea.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.059
Where you going?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.194
Carson's on.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.630
JACK: I'm glad you finally came
to your senses, Bobby.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.032
How do you mean?

16:39.066 --> 16:41.534
Well, I sent you out
of here six months ago

16:41.568 --> 16:44.404
with a stack of
premium hag scripts.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.707
Please tell me
that you picked one.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.577
Well, no, Jack, I didn't.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.645
You're killing me,
Bobby. Really?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.381
(sighs) Look, I know
you think I'm like

16:54.414 --> 16:56.149
a dog with a bone
with this thing,

16:56.183 --> 16:58.218
but let me explain
something to you, all right?

16:58.251 --> 17:01.154
Goldwyn is finished,
Mayer is dead,

17:01.188 --> 17:03.090
and Selznick is just
one pastrami sandwich away

17:03.123 --> 17:04.257
from a coronary.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.393
But Jack L. Warner

17:06.426 --> 17:09.396
still runs Warner Brothers.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.398
And incidentally,
how many brothers

17:11.431 --> 17:13.333
do you see standing
in this room?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.235
You're the only one, Jack.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.837
That's right.
I'm the last goddamn dinosaur.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.839
And I am up to my tits in tar.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.174
What are you talking about?

17:21.208 --> 17:22.942
The end.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.177
Talking about the end, Bobby.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.012
Oh, come on, Jack.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.415
My Fair Lady's the biggest hit
in the last five years.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.450
Yeah. And what
happens in six months

17:30.483 --> 17:32.619
when I don't have anything
to follow that up?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.921
I'll admit it, Bobby.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.857
I'm scared.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.927
I used to make
the culture.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.363
And today I'm lost in it.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.932
I am in the twilight

17:45.965 --> 17:47.867
of my days, Bobby.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.968
I know that.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.605
But I would... just like to keep

17:52.639 --> 17:55.775
the sun from going down
a little bit longer.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.810
Sure.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.447
I need a miracle.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.882
I need another
goddamn Baby Jane.

18:02.915 --> 18:08.054
And it's called What Ever
Happened to Cousin Charlotte?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.723
That's a great title.
I love this title.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.559
Because it'll remind people

18:12.592 --> 18:14.294
of What Ever Happened
to Baby Jane?
Mm-hmm.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.628
Right?
(chuckles)

18:15.662 --> 18:17.564
All right. Go ahead, hit me.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.333
What do you got?
Okay, so, it's about
an aging Southern belle

18:20.367 --> 18:22.068
Yeah.
who's living
all alone in one of those

18:22.101 --> 18:25.338
scary Louisiana
plantation mansions.
Uh-huh. Good.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.907
And she's got a city slicker
cousin who comes to visit.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.908
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
Huh?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.311
Drives her crazy,
gaslights her.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.012
So you got dismemberment--
there's a hatchet murder.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.647
Fantastic.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.749
So I was thinking. For Cousin
Charlotte, Bette Davis.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.151
And for the city
slicker cousin,

18:38.185 --> 18:40.153
Ann Sheridan.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.488
No, no.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.256
It's got to be Crawford.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.592
Crawford and Davis together,
that's the winning formula.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.827
This is my one condition, Jack.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.997
I am not working with them again
together, never again.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.765
You can't work with them? Wha...

18:52.799 --> 18:54.167
They hate each other.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.668
Besides, they'd never
agree to it.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.371
Bobby, if you think
it's twilight for us,

18:58.405 --> 19:00.373
it is midnight for them.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.342
They are gonna do your
Charlotte picture.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.511
And you know what?
They're gonna do it for less.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.679
And you know what else?
So are you.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.681
All right, I
want you to get

19:08.715 --> 19:10.383
those two harpies' signatures
on the dotted line.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.618
You got it?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.553
Got it, Jack.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.054
(pounds desk)
Thanks.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.724
Now get out of here.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.087
(exhales)

19:48.120 --> 19:49.722
Joanie.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.591
(knocking on door)

19:53.025 --> 19:54.894
Bette.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.263
Another horror picture, Bob?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.997
I wouldn't classify
it like that.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.899
Weren't you the one that
said we shouldn't be

19:59.932 --> 20:01.167
repeating ourselves?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.069
This is completely different.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.904
This time, you get to
kill the cleaning lady.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.340
ROBERT: Now, Charlotte's
nothing at all like Jane.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.909
Charlotte's a victim.
But she's also a fighter.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.011
JOAN:
Tell me about Miriam.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.447
Miriam. Elegant, calculating.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.782
But with a certain warmth.

20:15.815 --> 20:16.783
It needs an actress

20:16.816 --> 20:18.685
of real skill.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.752
And who do you see as Miriam?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.754
Uh, Joan, of course.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.256
JOAN:
And I suppose you want Bette

20:23.290 --> 20:25.758
to play Cousin Charlotte.

20:25.792 --> 20:26.759
Who else?

20:26.793 --> 20:27.927
And she's agreed?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.762
How could she say no?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.598
BETTE:
Are you out of your mind?

20:31.631 --> 20:35.468
I wouldn't piss on Crawford
if she were on fire.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.304
JOAN:
I think she secretly blames me

20:37.337 --> 20:39.372
for her Oscar loss.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.107
I don't think that's true.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.109
She actively lobbied against me,

20:43.142 --> 20:46.112
and then she wormed her way
into accepting Bancroft's award,

20:46.145 --> 20:47.447
which I understand

20:47.480 --> 20:49.215
Bancroft hasn't
even laid eyes on.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.784
Well...
JOAN:
I know she expected all sorts

20:51.818 --> 20:53.720
of offers after her nomination,

20:53.753 --> 20:55.988
but they never really
materialized, did they?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.457
BETTE:
And have you gotten a load

20:57.490 --> 20:58.558
of the interviews
that she's been

20:58.591 --> 21:00.460
giving lately for that stinker,

21:00.493 --> 21:02.995
Lady with the Axe, or
whatever the hell it's called?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.965
So goddamn grand,
you want to vomit.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.635
JOAN:
And now she's doing television?

21:08.668 --> 21:11.170
I mean, really,
is that a face America wants

21:11.203 --> 21:13.473
in its living room
at dinnertime?

21:13.506 --> 21:15.141
I don't think so.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.976
BETTE: She wouldn't
promote our picture.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.413
But she has no problem taking
her cow town carny act

21:20.447 --> 21:22.181
on the road with Bill, Bill...

21:22.214 --> 21:24.150
Castle.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.318
Yes. What I don't understand
is why

21:25.352 --> 21:26.986
you would want
to work with her again.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.155
Well, let's be honest, Bette,
working with either of you

21:29.188 --> 21:31.524
wasn't exactly
a picnic for me.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.993
But we did some good work
together, the three of us.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.662
Did we?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.029
I'm not so sure.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.665
What do you mean?

21:38.698 --> 21:39.999
I'm seen as a joke now.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.668
A white-faced ghoul.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.870
I let myself be overshadowed,

21:43.903 --> 21:45.705
pushed aside.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.006
A grotesque caricature.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.008
That's the way I'm going
to be remembered.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.445
I outlasted Garbo,
for Christ's sakes.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.782
Now I'm going out
as a dowdy matron?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.016
The answer's...

21:57.049 --> 21:58.017
No.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.018
Bette.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.020
Come on.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.822
There is no movie without you.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.191
Just tell me what you want.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.359
I want top billing,

22:06.393 --> 22:08.461
my name before hers.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.531
I want creative control.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.733
(laughs)

22:15.568 --> 22:17.404
Really?

22:17.437 --> 22:18.905
JOAN:
I want a big signing bonus.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.542
Jack Warner cooked the books
on Baby Jane.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.144
I want my payday up front.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.380
Every time I agree
to a back end,

22:27.414 --> 22:30.016
that's exactly
where I end up getting it.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.553
I'm through
getting pushed around.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.256
I know exactly what you mean.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.270
Five bucks, to handle your bags.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.539
(bell chiming)

22:55.608 --> 22:58.411
Cruise the parking lot, Teddy.

22:58.445 --> 23:01.013
Here.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.049
Get lost.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.753
Checking in, Miss Crawford?

23:06.786 --> 23:09.121
Presidential suite's taken.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.358
You know why I'm here, Hal.

23:12.391 --> 23:16.463
Someone has been calling
every rag in town

23:16.496 --> 23:19.098
claiming they have possession
of a blue movie,

23:19.131 --> 23:21.434
in which
I supposedly appear.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.302
Geez, Billie.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.871
That's awful.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.640
You bastard, I know it's you.

23:27.674 --> 23:31.110
You threatened to tell the world
about me and Daddy Cassin.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.145
I kept my mouth shut
on all that, didn't I?

23:33.179 --> 23:35.114
A very expensive silence.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.450
Hey, it's an
expensive town.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.151
Why do you
do this to me?

23:39.185 --> 23:41.788
When you came to Hollywood,
I found you work.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.656
As an extra, playing a clown.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.625
Nobody starts at the top.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.660
Yeah, guess you're
proof of that.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.466
Christ, why don't you
show some decency?

23:53.500 --> 23:56.903
This girl, whoever it is,
must have been desperate.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.006
Needed the money
for food or rent.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.509
Whatever it is you have,
you should burn it.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.511
I ain't in the habit
of burning money.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.380
No, you're not.

24:12.619 --> 24:17.524
(scoffs) This is half
what Lolly Parsons is offering.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.326
That's all I've got to spare.
I'm strapped.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.862
You? Strapped?

24:22.895 --> 24:24.997
Queen Pepsi, USA?

24:25.031 --> 24:27.967
Miss Big Fat Movie Star.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.004
You saw Baby Jane?

24:32.038 --> 24:34.206
I see all your pictures.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.043
I'm proud of my kid sister.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.181
That check is all

24:42.214 --> 24:44.450
you'll get for now.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.653
I'm at the end of my career.

24:48.655 --> 24:52.559
You want to call Lolly Parsons?

24:52.592 --> 24:54.727
Go ahead, ruin me.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.563
I don't care.

24:56.596 --> 25:00.366
I just want you to remember
where you came from, Billie,

25:00.399 --> 25:02.802
and how lucky you are.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.904
I have never been lucky.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.875
JACK:
L'Chaim, Bobby.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.877
I told you
it would all work out.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.211
Help yourself.

25:12.244 --> 25:17.149
Every studio
is struggling

25:17.183 --> 25:19.719
to find their own
hag horror picture.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.888
And we got
the two original hags.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.222
The winning
combination.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.257
I know.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.726
You know, I think

25:26.759 --> 25:28.895
that What Ever Happened
to Sister, uh...

25:28.928 --> 25:30.262
Cousin. Cousin Charlotte.
What?

25:30.296 --> 25:31.397
You changed it?

25:31.430 --> 25:33.065
No, it's always been
Cousin Charlotte.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.901
All right, it's gonna be
even bigger than Baby Jane.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.235
Yeah, I think so, too.
I do.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.670
And you know who
else thinks so?
Who?

25:37.704 --> 25:39.105
Darryl Zanuck.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.440
Why are you speaking
that betrayer's name

25:41.473 --> 25:43.275
in my presence, Bobby?

25:43.309 --> 25:45.244
Oh, come on,
that's a little harsh, isn't it?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.079
I don't think he betrayed you.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.749
I think he felt
creatively stifled here,

25:49.782 --> 25:51.117
so he just left.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.752
To form another studio.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.086
Well, he always wanted
to work with Bette

25:54.120 --> 25:55.254
after All About Eve,

25:55.287 --> 25:56.455
and now that he's back at 20th,

25:56.488 --> 25:58.257
I mean, it's a perfect fit.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.892
What? This?

26:01.661 --> 26:03.195
What are you saying?

26:03.229 --> 26:05.264
You shopped my picture
around to other studios?

26:05.297 --> 26:08.034
It's my picture, Jack.
And now, Zanuck's.

26:08.067 --> 26:12.371
You can't work for Zanuck.
We have an agreement.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.773
No, no, we don't.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.108
But I do have a
contract with Zanuck.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.277
Oh, and I'm not working for him,
we're partners.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.480
I have full autonomy, final cut,

26:21.513 --> 26:23.115
and some respect.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.652
Respect is cheap.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.788
And you tell Zanuck I'll sue.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.289
Fuck you!

26:30.322 --> 26:31.791
This is my genre.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.559
That's bullshit, Jack.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.294
I brought Baby Jane to you.

26:35.327 --> 26:38.130
I had to convince you
to do the picture. I was the one

26:38.164 --> 26:40.299
that had the vision.
I was the one that knew
Come on.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.001
these two women
still had something to offer.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.470
And what did you do
all that time? What did you do?

26:44.503 --> 26:46.639
You questioned me,
you berated me,

26:46.673 --> 26:48.307
you underestimated me,
to the point

26:48.340 --> 26:50.843
where I was questioning
and underestimating myself.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.645
And all this talk
about twilight

26:52.679 --> 26:55.147
and end of days-- oh, my God.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.482
Well, it might be twilight
for you, Jack,

26:56.515 --> 26:58.084
but it's not for me.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.853
From where I'm standing,
this twilight is a new dawn.

27:00.887 --> 27:04.991
(chuckling)
Oh, my God. You know what?

27:05.024 --> 27:08.427
If the speeches in Charlotte
are all as shitty as that one,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.697
Zanuck can have it.

27:10.730 --> 27:14.033
You fu-- give me--
give me back my cigar.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.534
I didn't come here
for your cigars.

27:15.567 --> 27:16.869
No, what'd you come here for?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.404
I came here
to get my balls back.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.541
You hear 'em clanking?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.495
(engines turn off)

27:48.567 --> 27:50.903
Nice dress, Lucille.

27:50.937 --> 27:54.540
(chuckles) Well, when I see
how casually you're attired,

27:54.573 --> 27:58.144
I guess my enthusiasm
for our little table read

27:58.177 --> 27:59.746
must have run
away with me.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.247
Oh, not at all.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.549
You can go straight from day
to night in that getup.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.752
You probably have plans
after this

28:05.785 --> 28:07.920
to accept another award.
Maybe the Nobel Prize

28:07.954 --> 28:09.722
on behalf of Dr. King?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.057
(chuckles wryly)

28:11.090 --> 28:12.859
(whispers):
Give it to her.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.435
Matches. Goodie.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.005
I remembered your
charming habit

28:26.038 --> 28:27.940
of striking matches on
the sole of your shoe.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.408
So, I found
those for you.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.944
Can I use them
to set you on fire?

28:31.978 --> 28:34.914
How ungrateful.
Shh.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.416
I meant it as a
symbolic gesture, Bette.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.786
I think we should burn
the pages of our past

28:39.819 --> 28:42.288
up until now
and start afresh.

28:45.624 --> 28:49.095
I know you need to
hear it from me,

28:49.128 --> 28:51.230
so here it is.

28:53.165 --> 28:57.469
I'm sorry if what happened
on Oscar night offended you.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.442
I don't want
your half-assed apology.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.277
I want a promise
from you.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.946
What?

29:06.979 --> 29:10.382
When we go in there,
we present a united front.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.118
Bob, Zanuck,
our costars

29:12.151 --> 29:13.786
are going to try
to push us around.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.387
The only way we're going
to get what we want

29:15.421 --> 29:18.124
is to speak with one voice,
preferably mine.

29:18.157 --> 29:21.227
I'm your sworn ally.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.696
Good. It serves us both.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.633
Shall we?

29:27.666 --> 29:28.634
After you.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.635
No, please, you first.

29:29.668 --> 29:30.970
Ladies first.
I insist.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.105
No, please.
(groans)

29:41.881 --> 29:43.682
PAULINE:
"Big Sam approaches

29:43.715 --> 29:45.751
"the painting of his daughter,
Charlotte,

29:45.784 --> 29:47.920
dressed in virginal white."

29:47.954 --> 29:51.323
"I fought to keep this house
and to bring it back up.

29:51.357 --> 29:55.928
"I don't have a son
to give it to, only Charlotte.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.663
And she ain't gonna
give it to you."

29:57.696 --> 29:59.265
BETTE:
No, Victor,

29:59.298 --> 30:00.933
I'm gonna pause you there.
This can't possibly be

30:00.967 --> 30:02.201
the opening of our film.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.003
What's wrong with it?
A couple of guys

30:04.036 --> 30:05.938
arguing in a study?

30:05.972 --> 30:07.539
We have an illicit
love affair,

30:07.573 --> 30:10.376
we have a Louisiana
plantation to play with,

30:10.409 --> 30:12.611
and our introduction
to Charlotte

30:12.644 --> 30:14.513
is a goddamn
oil painting.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.016
JOAN:
I agree with Bette.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.517
And I was also wondering,

30:18.550 --> 30:21.287
do we really need
all these ellipses?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.890
"Only Charlotte,"
dot, dot, dot.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.958
I mean, wouldn't a comma
be more appropriate?

30:25.992 --> 30:27.793
Even a semicolon.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.561
We're not submitting it to
the Library of Congress, Joan.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.696
ROBERT:
Ladies,

30:30.729 --> 30:32.398
c-can we just get
through it once?

30:32.431 --> 30:34.066
Victor, from wherever
you left off.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.101
VICTOR:
Yeah.

30:37.169 --> 30:41.140
"I ain't watched over my girl
all these years to have some--

30:41.173 --> 30:44.877
to have some creature
like you take her away."

30:44.911 --> 30:45.978
"Big Sam lunges at John,

30:46.012 --> 30:48.547
but John shields himself
behind a desk."

30:48.580 --> 30:49.648
BRUCE:
"Listen,

30:49.681 --> 30:51.217
"I'm gonna
tell you something.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.385
Your daughter
ain't a little girl anymore."

30:53.419 --> 30:54.987
BETTE:
What the hell is this?

30:55.021 --> 30:56.822
"A severed head
bounces down the staircase

30:56.855 --> 30:59.725
and rolls to a stop
at Charlotte's feet"?

30:59.758 --> 31:00.893
Why are you jumping ahead?

31:00.927 --> 31:02.228
Because I'm looking
for the changes

31:02.261 --> 31:04.063
that we discussed
and I'm not finding them.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.564
(Robert sighs)
What I see is--

31:05.597 --> 31:08.067
is chopped off hands
and bloodied stumps.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.002
But where are the
good character scenes?

31:10.036 --> 31:11.737
Where are the meaty monologues?

31:11.770 --> 31:14.773
Yes, and does the syntax concern
anyone else here at the table?

31:14.806 --> 31:16.408
I mean, Louisianians

31:16.442 --> 31:18.244
speak with a kind of

31:18.277 --> 31:20.346
music all their own.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.448
BETTE: Don't get me wrong.
I am not opposed

31:22.481 --> 31:23.849
to blood and
guts, all right?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.184
I mean, Shakespeare,
for Christ's sake,

31:25.217 --> 31:26.752
he had a woman eat
her sons in a pie,

31:26.785 --> 31:29.255
but there is
a fine line

31:29.288 --> 31:34.126
between art and trash, and
that line is plausibility.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.595
Well, let's keep our notes
until...
So, if you have a head

31:36.628 --> 31:38.297
bouncing down
the stairs, and

31:38.330 --> 31:39.765
to all the world it looks
like a rubber prop,

31:39.798 --> 31:43.102
well, then, my reaction
isn't scary, it's a joke.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.770
You know what
I'm talking about, Joan.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.139
I mean, that thing that
you just came off of, right?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.877
Well, I don't know, Bette.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.946
I think you sell
the believability

31:53.980 --> 31:55.281
with your performance.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.450
And granted, I mean,
we didn't have

31:58.484 --> 32:01.120
the most realistic looking
severed heads on Strait-Jacket,

32:01.153 --> 32:02.788
but the picture did

32:02.821 --> 32:05.724
a robust business.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.794
We drew a very young,
a very hip crowd.

32:08.827 --> 32:11.297
BETTE: Well, I'm not traipsing
around the country

32:11.330 --> 32:12.664
chopping off heads.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.233
No one would ask Brando
to do that.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.801
JOAN:
Brando isn't begging

32:15.834 --> 32:19.338
for a recurring role
on Wagon Train either.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.007
VICTOR:
Maybe we'll find

32:21.040 --> 32:23.175
a solution in reading
the whole story aloud.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.910
(chuckles)

32:24.943 --> 32:27.579
That's right, thank you.
Uh, uh, Pauline,

32:27.613 --> 32:28.814
pick it up from
where we ended.

32:28.847 --> 32:31.250
"Big Sam grips his cigar box

32:31.283 --> 32:33.019
"as if to smash
in John's skull,

32:33.052 --> 32:35.087
"but then takes out
a stogie to smoke.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.355
"He laughs
at the fear

32:36.388 --> 32:37.823
on John's face."

32:37.856 --> 32:38.991
(Victor laughs)

32:39.025 --> 32:39.858
(camera snapping)

32:39.891 --> 32:41.527
BETTE:
Oh, for Christ's sake,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.996
you said there was to be
no photography.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.264
He's up in the catwalk.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.332
He's not gonna
bother us.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.834
(laughing):
Oh, I didn't even see him there.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.369
Didn't you?

32:50.402 --> 32:53.339
I'm sorry you're not
camera-ready, Bette,

32:53.372 --> 32:54.773
but we don't have eight hours

32:54.806 --> 32:56.675
to wait for you
to put your face on.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.177
BETTE: Do you think
that matters to me?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.678
He's disrupting
our rehearsal.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.281
Do you think anyone cares to see
you mooning over a Pepsi-Cola?

33:02.314 --> 33:05.051
We are gonna get through this
if it kills us!

33:05.084 --> 33:07.353
Even if I have to
tranquilize the both of you!

33:07.386 --> 33:10.022
No, Bob, until you put some more
thought into this script,

33:10.056 --> 33:12.924
you are just wasting our time.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.065
And change
the goddamn title!

33:21.767 --> 33:24.170
(door closes)

33:30.076 --> 33:33.179
I'd be happy to read both parts.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.749
Shall we begin again?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.353
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

33:44.356 --> 33:46.725
HAL:
If you're here to

33:46.758 --> 33:48.494
smother me with a pillow,

33:48.527 --> 33:51.397
wait till I fall asleep.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.333
Why bother? You're
dead to me already.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.568
What do they say
is wrong with you?

33:56.602 --> 33:59.605
My appendix.
They want to take it out.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.108
Oh, well, that's
a minor matter.

34:02.141 --> 34:05.244
But before you
call around town

34:05.277 --> 34:09.948
with more lurid lies
about me, here.

34:09.981 --> 34:13.352
To cover your medical expenses.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.588
If you've any decency,
you'll agree.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.191
There's enough there to
purchase whatever it is

34:19.225 --> 34:20.792
you think you have.

34:20.826 --> 34:25.431
You mean my personal copy
of Velvet Lips?

34:25.464 --> 34:28.267
Oh...

34:28.300 --> 34:30.469
So much for the great
Joan Crawford

34:30.502 --> 34:32.771
being cash-strapped.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.041
I got an advance
on my next picture.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.778
I'm going to star with some of
my Oscar-nominated colleagues

34:39.811 --> 34:42.781
from Baby Jane, so the
studio is optimistic.

34:42.814 --> 34:46.218
(laughing):
Jesus, Joan.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.655
I'm lying here
like a beached fish

34:49.688 --> 34:52.324
and you still need to show off.

34:52.358 --> 34:55.794
Hey, I get it.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.297
I was the golden boy
everyone loved,

34:58.330 --> 34:59.331
you were the runt

34:59.365 --> 35:00.899
Mother didn't want.

35:00.932 --> 35:05.103
That's how you're always going
to see yourself.

35:06.438 --> 35:10.476
Do you think
I actually give a shit

35:10.509 --> 35:14.980
who kissed your sorry ass
back in Kansas 40 years ago?

35:15.013 --> 35:19.685
You think you're better than me,
but you're not,

35:19.718 --> 35:23.322
with your queen's English
and your furs

35:23.355 --> 35:26.091
and your martyr routine.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.827
Underneath, you're rotten trash,

35:28.860 --> 35:30.429
like me.
Then maybe you don't want...

35:30.462 --> 35:32.764
I'm keeping it as repayment

35:32.798 --> 35:35.701
for your shameful treatment
of Mother.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.269
Ready for the O.R.,
Mr. LeSueur?

35:37.303 --> 35:39.338
Shameful treatment!

35:39.371 --> 35:41.507
Bringing her out here
to California

35:41.540 --> 35:43.842
so she could decline in luxury?

35:43.875 --> 35:46.011
You made her use
the service entrance.

35:46.044 --> 35:48.547
You refused
to let her take meals

35:48.580 --> 35:50.349
with your kids,
for Christ's sake!

35:50.382 --> 35:54.620
I didn't want her poisoning
them with her junk.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.289
I didn't want them
to end up like you.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.357
Let's go.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.626
Come on, Hal.
The film.

36:00.659 --> 36:04.563
There is no film, Billie.
You said so yourself.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.711
Chops were nice.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.214
The fish was dry.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.882
What time is your
flight leaving?

36:23.915 --> 36:25.984
6:00 a.m.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.586
I want you to come with me.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.088
To the airport?
Baton Rouge.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.724
Oh, Louisiana
this time of year?

36:32.758 --> 36:33.725
No, thank you.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.228
Why not?

36:36.262 --> 36:38.730
Harriet.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.966
Let's just go home.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.585
What's the matter?

36:59.618 --> 37:02.521
Nothing. I'm sorry,

37:02.554 --> 37:04.590
you have to leave
early in the morning,

37:04.623 --> 37:07.926
and we can talk about it
when you get back.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.462
Why don't you want to
be part of my movie?

37:11.963 --> 37:14.099
Because I don't want to be
part of your life.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.802
What?

37:16.835 --> 37:19.605
Because I haven't been
for quite some time.

37:19.638 --> 37:22.874
And I never am when you're
making a picture.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.277
And you're only happy when
you're making a picture,

37:25.311 --> 37:27.279
going into battle.

37:27.313 --> 37:30.449
If you'd ever fought as hard
for me in this marriage

37:30.482 --> 37:33.218
as you do for
one of your stars,

37:33.251 --> 37:35.120
I wouldn't be saying this.

37:35.153 --> 37:37.989
And I hadn't planned
on saying it tonight,

37:38.023 --> 37:39.558
but I want a divorce.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.792
Harriet.

37:40.826 --> 37:41.793
And I have to believe
the only person

37:41.827 --> 37:43.061
who wants it more is you.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.563
Oh, please,
don't say that.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.398
Oh, Christ, Bob,
somebody has to.

37:46.432 --> 37:47.966
And you won't.

37:47.999 --> 37:51.169
Maybe because you never
stopped having a life.

37:51.202 --> 37:53.572
I'm not sure
when mine ended,

37:53.605 --> 37:55.641
but I'm gonna get it back,

37:55.674 --> 37:57.008
but not with you.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.690
Mamacita, here,

38:11.723 --> 38:13.925
nude hose for the twins.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.161
I'm afraid, in those cotton
tights they're beginning to look

38:16.194 --> 38:18.697
like overgrown toddlers.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.768
Please join me
in the living room.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.202
Why?

38:24.235 --> 38:26.738
I have difficult news.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.109
No, now what is it?
Just tell me.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.712
The hospital called.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.781
Your brother died in surgery.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.550
His appendix exploded.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.422
Huh.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.258
Just like that.

39:01.907 --> 39:05.811
Sometimes, when the
emotions are too many,

39:05.844 --> 39:07.746
we cannot cry.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.428
Jerry,

39:22.461 --> 39:25.063
hello,
this is Joan Crawford.

39:25.096 --> 39:29.735
Yes. I'm sorry to bug you after
hours, but I was wondering,

39:29.768 --> 39:32.604
are the payments for Charlotte
coming in all right?

39:33.872 --> 39:35.607
Wonderful.

39:35.641 --> 39:39.110
Jerry, listen,
do me a favor, please.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.414
Call City National first thing
in the morning when they open

39:42.448 --> 39:46.918
and cancel a check for me.

39:46.952 --> 39:50.789
Yes, I wrote it to my brother,
Hal LeSueur,

39:50.822 --> 39:52.691
dated today.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.695
No, he won't be needing
a loan after all.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.363
Yes, thank you, dear.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.468
Oh, and my best...
my best to Anita.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.939
There is a bright side.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.776
You do not need the surplus
to pay for your brother,

40:10.809 --> 40:12.444
so you are not forced
to do the movie

40:12.478 --> 40:14.813
with that terrible
Miss Davis.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.451
I'm not pulling out
of Charlott now.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.652
It has potential.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.988
It has potential
to ruin your life.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.991
What do you want me to do,
Mamacita?

40:26.024 --> 40:28.727
What, sit here by myself

40:28.760 --> 40:31.730
toasting my memories, hmm?

40:31.763 --> 40:34.299
There are many pleasures
still to enjoy.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.667
New friends.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.969
You are invited to
parties all the time.

40:38.003 --> 40:43.509
I can't show my face without
having a picture to discuss.

40:43.542 --> 40:47.479
If I'm not working,
I might as well be dead.

40:47.513 --> 40:49.648
Get some sleep.

40:49.681 --> 40:53.018
It's a long flight
to Baton Rouge.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.540
MAN: All right, everybody,
take five.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.575
(indistinct chatter)

41:19.745 --> 41:22.848
I can't play a schoolmate of
these children, it's obscene.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.783
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Bette,

41:24.816 --> 41:26.017
but you're the one
who insisted

41:26.051 --> 41:27.686
on playing young Charlotte
yourself.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.054
You're just going to have
to shoot me from the back.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.789
We can't, because we need

41:30.822 --> 41:33.024
to capture the evidence.
Oh.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.126
Well, then, cast one of
these girls as a lookalike,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.962
put her face in the shadow,
and I'll do the voice.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.229
Where the hell is Bob?

41:38.263 --> 41:41.399
Taking a nature break.
Uh, maybe...

41:58.617 --> 42:01.987
All right, the wheels are flying
off the scene in there,

42:02.020 --> 42:03.088
and you're out here

42:03.121 --> 42:04.923
watering the daffodils.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.558
Wha...

42:06.592 --> 42:08.393
Are you crying?

42:08.426 --> 42:10.428
I can't do it, Bette.
I can't make this picture.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.097
What the hell are you
talking about?

42:12.130 --> 42:14.065
Harriet and I are over.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.767
Christ.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.436
Is it final?

42:18.469 --> 42:19.938
Seems to be.

42:19.971 --> 42:24.442
She doesn't feel like
she's part of my life.

42:24.475 --> 42:26.411
The crazy irony is that
we were all going

42:26.444 --> 42:27.846
to be together
on this picture.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.414
You know, the kids
have all got parts.

42:29.447 --> 42:32.517
Adele's working on helping
with the script.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.286
Harriet was supposed to be here
enjoying it with me.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.857
Now I'm just looking around
and I'm thinking...

42:38.890 --> 42:40.025
this has ruined my marriage.

42:40.058 --> 42:43.094
I'm not going to candy-coat it.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.430
Harriet is a
wonderful woman.

42:45.463 --> 42:48.099
Losing her is
going to be bad.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.467
It always is.

42:49.500 --> 42:52.270
I know, I've been through it
four times.

42:52.303 --> 42:57.442
But I survived...
and so will you.

42:57.475 --> 42:59.945
24 years, Bette.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.947
I don't know how to be alone.

43:01.980 --> 43:04.015
We'll be alone together.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.488
Come on.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.159
MAN (over P.A.):
Delta 39 confirmed

43:14.192 --> 43:16.494
for transpo
to Secure Facility 2.

43:43.188 --> 43:46.357
Well, perhaps our driver
is waiting for us

43:46.391 --> 43:48.359
at the baggage claim.

43:58.737 --> 44:01.606
We are checking in.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.009
Oh, I'm sorry,
we're all full up.

44:04.042 --> 44:05.677
They're shooting a movie.

44:05.711 --> 44:07.679
We are part of this movie.

44:07.713 --> 44:10.515
Joan.
Bette.

44:10.548 --> 44:12.684
Finally, a friendly face.

44:12.718 --> 44:13.952
When did you get in?

44:13.985 --> 44:15.854
Well, hours ago,
but there was no one

44:15.887 --> 44:17.355
at the airport to greet us.

44:17.388 --> 44:18.890
Oh, no.

44:18.924 --> 44:21.092
But you made it.
What a trooper.

44:23.895 --> 44:26.297
And now she's saying
there's no room here for us.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.399
Nonsense, Frannie.

44:28.433 --> 44:31.469
Miss Crawford has a reservation
for a suite.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.071
She's part of
the production.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.472
Well, of course, Miss Davis.

44:34.505 --> 44:35.741
You just have a seat.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.375
We're gonna get that
ready for you.

44:37.408 --> 44:38.643
Won't take but an hour.

44:38.676 --> 44:41.312
An hour?
BETTE:
Oh, relax, Joan.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.648
This is Baton Rouge,
not Beverly Hills.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.917
Oh, my ice is melting.

44:45.951 --> 44:48.586
See you on the set.

44:48.619 --> 44:51.622
She is enjoying this.

44:55.093 --> 44:56.928
MAMACITA: You would think
there would at least be

44:56.962 --> 44:59.330
a complimentary gift
basket waiting for you.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.667
Well, we're here now, and it's
not so terribly bad, is it?

45:02.700 --> 45:05.503
It stinks! They have put
us next to the garbage.

45:05.536 --> 45:09.707
It's Louisiana-- everything has
the sweet smell of rot.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.913
I've made a decision, Mamacita.

45:14.946 --> 45:18.116
We are going to put
this dreadful day behind us,

45:18.149 --> 45:21.586
and I'm determined to enter
into this project

45:21.619 --> 45:24.355
with the proper spirit.

45:24.389 --> 45:27.759
In fact, I think I'll call
Mr. Aldrich now,

45:27.793 --> 45:29.761
tell him we've arrived safely,

45:29.795 --> 45:31.797
and perhaps give him
a couple of the notes

45:31.830 --> 45:33.965
that I made on the plane.

45:36.134 --> 45:38.269
(line ringing)

45:38.303 --> 45:41.539
Yes, hello,
this is Joan Crawford.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.441
Could you connect me

45:43.474 --> 45:47.112
with Bob Aldrich's suite,
please?

45:47.145 --> 45:48.713
ROBERT (chuckling):
Hello?

45:48.746 --> 45:53.118
Mm. Bob? It's Joan.
(chuckles)

45:53.151 --> 45:56.788
I just wanted to let you know
that we have arrived,

45:56.822 --> 45:59.390
and we're tucked away snuggly
in our little bungalow.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.559
A bit of a snafu at the airport,

46:01.592 --> 46:05.496
but we're here,
and I am raring to go.

46:05.530 --> 46:06.898
BETTE (laughing):
Bob, hang up.

46:06.932 --> 46:09.634
The champagne's going flat.
(laughing)

46:09.667 --> 46:11.002
ROBERT (laughing):
Well, that's great, Joan.

46:11.036 --> 46:12.637
You get some rest.

46:12.670 --> 46:15.006
We'll see you tomorrow on set.
Bye-bye. (hangs up)

46:15.040 --> 46:19.510
* Of mine *

46:19.544 --> 46:24.883
* Don't break this heart. *
