WEBVTT

00:39.135 --> 00:41.416
Well, there's no name
on it, but the card says,

00:41.417 --> 00:44.116
"A new set of wings for my favorite angel."

00:44.117 --> 00:46.139
"Sorry about the color."

00:46.140 --> 00:47.842
Well, that can only be from Matt to you.

00:47.843 --> 00:49.450
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Aww.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.894
Well, as long as it's not
pink, then you're safe.

00:53.895 --> 00:58.529
Oh-oh.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.530
Oh!

00:59.531 --> 01:02.497
Yeah, oh my gosh, these are
the exact ones I wanted.

01:02.498 --> 01:03.331
Sorry.

01:03.332 --> 01:04.949
You pay attention.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.546
- I do.
- Honey, thank you so much.

01:06.547 --> 01:08.047
Merry Christmas.

01:09.090 --> 01:11.449
- Okay, next.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11.450 --> 01:12.450
There's more.

01:16.459 --> 01:17.918
- It's pink, too.
- Open it.

01:17.919 --> 01:19.836
They match, good job.

01:29.791 --> 01:30.680
God!

01:30.681 --> 01:32.190
Yeah?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.219
Winning Powerball ticket?

01:35.220 --> 01:36.569
No, no!

01:36.570 --> 01:39.129
Two tickets to Africa, for both of us!

01:39.130 --> 01:40.893
- Africa?
- The Furnace!

01:42.450 --> 01:44.549
It's, um, it's a race.

01:44.550 --> 01:47.659
150 miles across the biggest
animal reserve in the world.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.686
You run with buffaloes,
lions, elephants, rhinos.

01:51.687 --> 01:53.229
- Leopards.
- Leopards.

01:53.230 --> 01:54.899
The big five, you know?

01:54.900 --> 01:56.653
You race against animals?

01:57.540 --> 01:58.629
No.

01:58.630 --> 02:01.579
No, Mom, you race against people.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.119
I mean, there's animals
there, but some racers do get

02:05.120 --> 02:08.199
a little too close for comfort,
but that's the fun of it.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.032
I bet there's nothing like being chased

02:10.032 --> 02:12.209
by a lion to make you run faster, right?

02:12.210 --> 02:14.398
- Especially with you.
- Oh.

02:14.399 --> 02:15.839
You couldn't find
something more suitable

02:15.840 --> 02:20.509
for your honeymoon like
Venice or Paris?

02:20.510 --> 02:21.510
Matt!

02:22.460 --> 02:24.168
Have a safe flight!

02:24.169 --> 02:25.419
Bye!

02:25.420 --> 02:26.793
Oh, my god, that's cold.

02:28.110 --> 02:30.926
Man, we should've warmed
this thing up first.

02:30.927 --> 02:32.569
Oh, god.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.649
Your present went down
like a lead balloon, huh?

02:35.650 --> 02:36.759
You can't blame your mom.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.810
In her mind, you're still in junior high.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.687
Hey, merry Christmas.

03:00.899 --> 03:02.739
We've all been there.

03:02.740 --> 03:05.183
Some worse than others, of course.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.800
I'm talking about the bottom of your soul,

03:12.790 --> 03:14.440
where there's nowhere left to go.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.229
A suffocating nothingness as death

03:29.230 --> 03:31.333
tightens its grasp around your throat.

03:32.329 --> 03:33.738
Squeezing.

03:33.739 --> 03:34.739
Hard.

05:52.781 --> 05:56.360
You said I would
be fine with the one lung.

05:56.361 --> 06:01.361
Yeah, I didn't say you'd be
able to run through the woods.

06:01.470 --> 06:04.093
I wasn't running, I was jogging.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.379
You were lucky the man
you were chasing after

06:07.380 --> 06:08.380
was a doctor.

06:10.483 --> 06:12.147
I wasn't chasing anyone.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.323
That's not what he said.

06:19.350 --> 06:20.500
You should be thankful.

06:24.129 --> 06:25.129
Thankful?

06:27.280 --> 06:29.273
You could've
ended up in a wheelchair.

06:33.530 --> 06:34.530
Mary.

06:38.221 --> 06:40.221
Why didn't I just die?

06:45.270 --> 06:48.663
Even before I
met her, I buried her husband.

06:51.130 --> 06:52.559
That's if you can call being married

06:52.560 --> 06:54.790
to a man for two days your husband.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.509
She never noticed me,
she was too bent over

07:06.510 --> 07:09.438
with that oxygen mask of
hers to notice anything.

07:09.439 --> 07:11.257
I hate you!

07:13.707 --> 07:15.723
Did you, uh, say something?

07:23.127 --> 07:24.294
Who are you?

07:25.399 --> 07:26.859
I am the grave digger.

07:26.860 --> 07:27.860
Coffin.

07:33.018 --> 07:34.349
Coffin?

07:34.350 --> 07:36.613
Yeah, well, for obvious reasons.

07:39.098 --> 07:40.098
Are you okay?

08:02.930 --> 08:03.780
The lawyers tell me that

08:03.781 --> 08:05.530
you haven't given a deposition yet.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.669
We can't hold them
responsible for the brake pads

08:08.670 --> 08:10.033
on the truck until you do.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.033
I don't care.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.039
This money can go a long way
to help covering your med...

08:17.040 --> 08:18.869
I don't want it.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.930
Mary, I'm just trying to help.

08:20.931 --> 08:23.819
I didn't ask for your help.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.463
I didn't ask for anyone's help.

08:27.699 --> 08:29.149
I just wish you'd all leave me alone,

08:29.150 --> 08:31.659
but everyone, they just love a cripple!

08:31.660 --> 08:33.519
You are not a cripple!

08:33.520 --> 08:35.470
Oh, yeah, then what do you call this?

08:36.679 --> 08:37.610
And this!

08:37.610 --> 08:38.610
Mary.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.469
I just want it to stop.

08:42.470 --> 08:44.669
Mary.

09:44.780 --> 09:45.780
Neil Armstrong.

09:51.915 --> 09:55.082
The first man to set foot on the Moon.

09:59.426 --> 10:02.009
I know who Neil Armstrong is.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.647
Well, one small step for
women, one huge leap for you.

10:14.546 --> 10:16.129
What do you want?

10:17.080 --> 10:18.080
I can help you.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.237
I don't want any help.

10:22.616 --> 10:25.079
Well, what we want and
what we need are often

10:25.080 --> 10:26.437
completely different.

10:30.789 --> 10:33.856
And what is it that I need, huh?

10:33.857 --> 10:35.183
For someone to catch you.

10:36.110 --> 10:37.883
Who says I'm gonna fall?

10:41.127 --> 10:42.377
You just did.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.920
Coffin!

10:53.610 --> 10:54.610
You remembered.

10:55.869 --> 10:58.126
It's a hard name to forget.

10:58.127 --> 10:59.127
Mm, yeah.

11:01.309 --> 11:03.219
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

11:03.220 --> 11:06.700
I've got a huge funeral,
but I knock off at five.

11:12.829 --> 11:14.579
I was a doctor, once.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.390
Doctor, huh?

11:16.391 --> 11:17.785
Wow.

11:17.786 --> 11:20.169
Yes, there was a
civil war in my country,

11:20.170 --> 11:22.720
and when the killing started,
I managed to get out.

11:23.880 --> 11:27.733
But unfortunately, no other
member of my family was able to.

11:30.180 --> 11:31.180
Sorry.

11:32.245 --> 11:34.445
Well, like I said,
it was a long time ago.

11:36.590 --> 11:37.590
So...

11:39.190 --> 11:43.665
If you're a doctor, I mean,
you're qualified, right?

11:43.666 --> 11:46.859
Well, is there any other kind?

11:46.860 --> 11:49.333
So, why aren't you practicing?

11:51.510 --> 11:54.659
Well, in America,
the degree's different.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.610
You have study for a further two years.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.550
Why didn't you?

12:02.650 --> 12:03.650
I, um...

12:06.800 --> 12:09.999
I was busy trying to make ends meet.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.299
I mean, I worked as an orderly.

12:12.300 --> 12:16.933
But I was fired for giving
a patient the wrong advice.

12:17.950 --> 12:20.059
Her doctor misdiagnosed her.

12:20.060 --> 12:22.849
I mean, he was inexperienced,
so it was understandable.

12:22.850 --> 12:25.033
He just refused to take my advice.

12:26.197 --> 12:27.705
What happened?

12:27.706 --> 12:29.029
Well, she died.

12:29.030 --> 12:32.379
Not from anything I did,
there were complications.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.653
He failed to see a clot in her brain.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.489
Of course, he knew about
the business with the pills,

12:39.490 --> 12:42.433
and blamed me for his negligence.

12:44.290 --> 12:48.393
Yeah, so I, um, I spent
five years in jail.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.209
So, why did you say
that you could help me?

12:53.210 --> 12:54.210
I'm a doctor.

12:56.260 --> 12:57.463
Not anymore.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.623
I put my faith in a higher power.

13:03.026 --> 13:04.026
God?

13:04.695 --> 13:07.963
Mm, I've seen him do incredible things.

13:09.986 --> 13:10.986
Really?

13:12.630 --> 13:14.999
After everything that's happened to you,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.153
how can you still believe in God?

13:18.154 --> 13:19.339
When Joseph was thrown in prison,

13:19.340 --> 13:22.763
he didn't dwell on the
injustice, he believed.

13:26.110 --> 13:27.153
I believe in God.

13:29.045 --> 13:30.095
And I believe in you.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.323
If you let me, I'd like to
help you out of your prison.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.303
You think you can do that?

13:41.960 --> 13:43.781
I think we can.

13:48.986 --> 13:50.597
Have that.

13:50.598 --> 13:52.576
Have that, now blow.

13:52.577 --> 13:53.637
Bubbles.

13:53.638 --> 13:54.638
Blow.

14:00.278 --> 14:01.111
Faster!

14:01.112 --> 14:02.611
Lift the knees up!

14:13.646 --> 14:15.216
Okay, all right, okay.

14:15.217 --> 14:18.213
I'm here, I'll save you,
just go down for a while.

14:18.214 --> 14:20.464
Come on, come on.

14:20.465 --> 14:23.053
Deeply, chest out, chin up.

14:23.054 --> 14:28.054
Some more, more.

14:28.276 --> 14:30.326
There's plenty more where that came from.

14:34.524 --> 14:35.941
Faster than that!

14:44.370 --> 14:46.013
Hey, what're you...

14:59.720 --> 15:01.723
Courage does not always roar.

15:02.750 --> 15:06.759
Sometimes, courage is a quiet
voice at the end of the day,

15:06.760 --> 15:09.046
saying "I will try again tomorrow",

15:09.047 --> 15:11.697
"and the tomorrow after that
tomorrow, if necessary."

15:23.461 --> 15:24.461
It worked!

15:27.770 --> 15:29.159
Mom!

15:29.160 --> 15:31.813
- Sweetheart, you're early.
- Hey, yeah.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.229
Where is it?

15:37.230 --> 15:38.439
Where's what?

15:38.440 --> 15:41.016
Oh, stop playing silly games, where...

15:41.017 --> 15:42.439
- It's in the car.
- I'll go get it.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.419
Oh, no, no, Coffin will bring it.

15:44.420 --> 15:45.420
Coffin!

15:46.500 --> 15:48.003
- Coffin?
- Coffin!

15:50.795 --> 15:51.803
Ah, thank you.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.837
Mom, this is Coffin.

15:55.838 --> 15:57.439
How do you do?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.593
He works in the
cemetery, digging graves.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.469
- Digging graves, oh.
- Yes, yes, that's right.

16:03.470 --> 16:04.370
I've been doing it so long,

16:04.371 --> 16:06.336
I can barely remember my first name.

16:08.070 --> 16:09.020
I'm just kidding.

16:09.021 --> 16:10.619
Shegai Shanan.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.250
Oh, Shlegai, um...

16:14.370 --> 16:16.024
That's why they call me Coffin.

16:16.025 --> 16:17.769
Yeah.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.220
He's gonna stay for dinner.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.839
Oh, but why didn't you phone me?

16:21.840 --> 16:24.421
I only prepared for the three of us!

16:24.422 --> 16:25.889
What's to eat, like a bird?

16:25.890 --> 16:27.169
Let's just give him some of mine.

16:27.170 --> 16:30.139
- What's going on?
- Hi, Dad, this is Coffin.

16:30.140 --> 16:31.199
How do you do?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.190
Coffin?

16:32.191 --> 16:34.469
- Yes.
- I'll explain later.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.619
Well, let's not loiter in the doorway,

16:36.620 --> 16:38.479
giving the neighbors
something to gossip about.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.199
Come on, come in.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.130
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

16:41.131 --> 16:43.439
I was petrified!

16:43.440 --> 16:46.589
I mean, I'm standing there, the
lion's cornered and I've got

16:46.590 --> 16:49.919
my spear anchored in the ground
and I waited and the lion

16:49.920 --> 16:53.459
just jumps at me and the teeth and jaws!

16:53.460 --> 16:56.039
I could see its tonsils and
I was thinking to myself,

16:56.040 --> 16:57.663
wow, what great big...

16:59.079 --> 17:00.329
He's a fascinating man.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.114
Yeah.

17:02.115 --> 17:03.163
Yeah, he really is.

17:04.470 --> 17:05.970
You don't know the half of it.

17:09.659 --> 17:13.233
What a nice change not to
talk about me for a while.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.229
Honey, I don't think
it's such a good idea

17:18.230 --> 17:21.848
to stop wearing the oxygen mask.

17:21.849 --> 17:23.688
What did I just say, Mom?

17:23.689 --> 17:25.059
Yes, I know, I know, I know.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.898
But have you mentioned
this to Dr. Phillips?

17:27.900 --> 17:28.733
No, why should I?

17:28.734 --> 17:30.809
She's gonna say what you say.

17:30.810 --> 17:33.819
She knows a lot more
about this than you or I.

17:33.820 --> 17:34.820
Not Coffin.

17:35.819 --> 17:38.053
- What?
- Coffin's a doctor, too.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.369
I thought you said he was a gravedigger?

17:43.370 --> 17:44.403
Yeah, he is.

17:45.770 --> 17:47.429
Mary, please don't tell me

17:47.430 --> 17:49.139
he's some kind of a witch doctor.

17:49.140 --> 17:50.673
A witch doctor?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.829
Yeah, the occult, voodoo.

17:54.830 --> 17:56.386
All that stuff they do in Africa.

17:56.387 --> 17:58.109
"Stuff they do in Africa."

17:58.110 --> 17:59.689
Really, Mom?

17:59.690 --> 18:01.013
That stuff is real.

18:01.850 --> 18:03.633
You know, you know what?

18:04.590 --> 18:05.699
Coffin's the reason I'm standing here,

18:05.700 --> 18:07.219
breathing like a normal human being.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.739
Can't you just be happy for me for once?

18:09.740 --> 18:10.899
Of course I'm glad.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.909
And you, of all people, should approve,

18:12.910 --> 18:15.149
'cause he thinks it's
God that's healing me.

18:15.150 --> 18:16.769
Oh, Mary.

18:16.770 --> 18:19.479
It's true, even though his
entire village was slaughtered,

18:19.480 --> 18:21.119
he still believes in God.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.384
There's no reason to be so blasphemous.

18:23.385 --> 18:24.622
"Blasphemous."

18:24.623 --> 18:26.149
You know what, I'm getting
stronger by the day.

18:26.150 --> 18:29.213
I can run almost a mile without
needing that stupid mask.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.073
- Run?
- Yes, run!

18:36.900 --> 18:40.913
I've entered a park run,
it's, it's only 10 miles.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.992
- 10 miles?
- Yeah, it's a start.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.359
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.289
You're gonna injure yourself, I'm, I'm,

18:49.290 --> 18:50.829
I'm calling Dr. Phillips in the morning.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.130
She is not my doctor anymore!

18:56.280 --> 18:58.809
- We're leaving, now?
- What's that?

18:58.810 --> 18:59.810
Mary?

19:00.730 --> 19:01.809
- Mary.
- Mary?

19:01.810 --> 19:02.810
Mary?

19:20.032 --> 19:21.112
Are you don't want me
to ride alongside you

19:21.113 --> 19:22.363
with the oxygen cylinder?

19:24.342 --> 19:25.492
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.842
I'll be so far behind, you
won't even know I'm there.

19:29.843 --> 19:32.493
No, it's okay, just wait
for me at the finish line.

19:34.294 --> 19:35.294
Look.

19:37.433 --> 19:40.149
If I don't see you at the
finish line in an hour,

19:40.150 --> 19:42.199
I'm gonna come looking for you.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.103
I'll do better than
that, 53 minutes tops.

19:47.283 --> 19:49.366
You've come a long way.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.599
God really has...
No, no, I did this.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.509
We did this, hard work
and perseverance did this.

19:56.510 --> 19:58.273
Not some magical spirit in the sky.

20:07.050 --> 20:10.603
If you feel like you
don't wanna go on, don't.

20:14.433 --> 20:15.863
There's no shame in stopping.

20:17.170 --> 20:19.120
You've obviously never been a runner.

20:25.453 --> 20:26.286
Mary!

20:26.287 --> 20:27.472
They say sorrow looks back.

20:27.473 --> 20:29.501
Got the oxygen tank.

20:29.502 --> 20:30.599
If you need it, okay?

20:30.600 --> 20:31.873
Worry looks around.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.879
Mary, pace yourself!

20:34.880 --> 20:36.213
And faith looks up.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.030
But sometimes,

20:40.440 --> 20:43.419
it's good to just keep
your eyes on the ground.

21:33.893 --> 21:37.476
Okay, we're gettin'
out, thank you, over.

21:50.994 --> 21:52.334
Mary, Mary!

21:52.335 --> 21:53.492
Stand back, sir.

21:53.493 --> 21:55.121
Stand back, sir.

21:55.122 --> 21:57.020
- Stand back, please.
- She needs this!

21:57.021 --> 21:59.188
She needs this to breathe!

22:00.248 --> 22:01.847
No, she needs this to breathe!

22:01.848 --> 22:03.019
Mary!

22:03.020 --> 22:04.020
Mary!

22:29.751 --> 22:31.040
What's he doing here?

22:31.041 --> 22:32.219
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.352
I was there when it happened.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.742
You killed her!

22:35.743 --> 22:37.651
It's all your fault, you killed her!

22:37.652 --> 22:40.512
She's not dead.

22:40.513 --> 22:46.952
Sweetie, sweetie, she's not...
Look at her!

22:46.953 --> 22:50.382
Look at her!

22:50.383 --> 22:52.043
Come here, come here.

22:52.044 --> 22:53.627
It's okay, come on.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.982
How many bodies have I buried?

23:02.983 --> 23:04.229
1,000?

23:04.230 --> 23:05.230
2,000?

23:06.510 --> 23:09.403
I'd lost count in the drudgery
that had become my life.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.743
I prayed to God that Mary not
be another forgotten number.

23:21.258 --> 23:22.258
Is she dead?

23:30.890 --> 23:32.359
My wife wants to see you pay the price

23:32.360 --> 23:33.660
for what happened to Mary.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.529
What is that?

23:49.530 --> 23:51.430
I know you were only trying to help.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.980
There's a ticket to go home in here.

23:57.810 --> 23:58.810
Use it.

24:33.295 --> 24:34.404
- Ah.
- Ah.

24:34.405 --> 24:35.434
- Ah.
- Ah.

24:35.435 --> 24:36.524
- Ah.
- Ah.

24:36.525 --> 24:37.694
Amen.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.359
All right, okay, okay.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.527
It's all right, all right.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.037
Wonderful, all right.

25:41.074 --> 25:43.407
You're a hard man to find.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.372
Yeah, it's me.

25:49.373 --> 25:50.206
I'm real.

25:50.206 --> 25:51.206
Here, feel.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.379
I'll wait for you outside.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.899
I had worked in a cemetery for years,

26:11.900 --> 26:15.429
and yet, I saw my first ghost
only when I was back home.

26:15.430 --> 26:16.430
Among the living.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.448
Come on, let me show you around.

26:42.449 --> 26:43.976
Okay.

26:43.977 --> 26:44.820
Thanks.

26:44.821 --> 26:47.863
So, uh, this is all pre-war.

26:49.157 --> 26:51.324
Was part of the civil war.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.933
It's so beautiful in here.

26:56.620 --> 26:57.620
Yes.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.109
It is somewhat special.

27:00.110 --> 27:02.860
It's the only place that
survived the civil war intact.

27:03.746 --> 27:04.746
Wow.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.459
The church lets
me use it for a clinic.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
Once a week.

27:11.888 --> 27:12.888
Nice.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.200
Your father told me you were dead.

27:19.030 --> 27:19.863
Yeah.

27:19.863 --> 27:20.863
Yeah, I know.

27:23.314 --> 27:24.314
He wanted you gone.

27:28.070 --> 27:29.863
To say that you were dead.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.823
It worked, didn't it?

27:35.414 --> 27:36.479
I mean, I thought you'd abandoned me,

27:36.480 --> 27:38.680
until my dad told me
about the plane ticket.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.373
I thought you were dead.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.317
Good times, right?

27:51.677 --> 27:53.127
But I'm happy you're alive.

27:55.612 --> 27:56.612
Come on.

27:58.357 --> 27:59.513
I'm sorry.

28:07.730 --> 28:08.730
Very romantic.

28:12.730 --> 28:14.093
Well, it's not by choice.

28:15.470 --> 28:17.770
Load shedding, it happens
every now and again.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.869
What's load shedding?

28:20.870 --> 28:24.449
Well, they cut the
power to some districts,

28:24.450 --> 28:28.599
in order to continue the supply
of power to other districts.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.463
They choose the worst times to do it.

28:29.464 --> 28:31.173
I mean, it's totally frustrating.

28:32.230 --> 28:34.913
Oh, I bet it helps you
get to sleep earlier.

28:36.020 --> 28:38.523
Oh, I suppose that's one benefit.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.960
Why are you here?

28:54.758 --> 28:56.349
You don't travel 10,000 miles

28:56.350 --> 28:59.545
to come and have dinner
with an old fart like me.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
The Furnace.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.373
It's a death trap.

29:20.470 --> 29:21.470
Maybe.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.299
You could die out there.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.689
- Maybe.
- Well, is that what you want?

29:26.690 --> 29:27.690
Of course not.

29:28.537 --> 29:30.079
Well, help me understand.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.113
Is it some kind of a calling from God?

29:33.460 --> 29:34.959
Don't start that again.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.339
God has better things to
do than interfere with me.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.239
In our culture, there's
something called Ugutwasa.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.979
It's like a calling from your ancestors,

29:42.980 --> 29:44.810
- or a calling from God.
- Coffin.

29:46.030 --> 29:47.569
Look.

29:47.570 --> 29:50.229
I've been there and I lost my husband,

29:50.230 --> 29:52.269
I lost my health, I'm not trying to find...

29:52.270 --> 29:54.193
Mary, what do you want from me?

29:59.460 --> 30:01.060
I need you to help me prepare.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.019
No.

30:04.020 --> 30:04.853
No?

30:04.854 --> 30:05.929
No?

30:05.930 --> 30:08.453
I did it once before
and you nearly died.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.250
Don't ask me to do that again.

30:20.926 --> 30:25.168
We'll see about that.

30:32.410 --> 30:33.749
Open your mouth.

30:33.750 --> 30:34.750
Ah.

30:35.482 --> 30:36.482
Ah.

30:37.831 --> 30:38.831
Ah.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.121
Morning.

31:00.371 --> 31:01.454
Good morning.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.082
Good morning.

31:25.239 --> 31:26.679
You're not gonna go away, are you?

31:28.110 --> 31:29.160
So, you'll help me?

31:33.700 --> 31:35.309
You're gonna need
more than just a trainer

31:35.310 --> 31:36.589
to succeed in all of this.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.188
- No, I'm...
- Ah, ah.

31:40.740 --> 31:43.939
Your breathing has improved
remarkably over the last year.

31:43.940 --> 31:45.369
Strength isn't an issue.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.170
Obviously you're as strong as an ox.

31:48.227 --> 31:49.227
- Ox?
- Ah-ah.

31:50.090 --> 31:52.182
And as stubborn as one, as well.

31:53.540 --> 31:56.023
But the African Bush
isn't to be trifled with.

31:57.140 --> 31:59.089
It'll get into your head.

31:59.090 --> 32:02.459
Pick you up, spin you around,
chew you up and spit you out.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.233
It'll snuff your life
out in a split second.

32:07.580 --> 32:08.413
You're gonna have to acquire

32:08.414 --> 32:10.133
a whole new set of survival skills.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.579
Gonna have to learn how to
survive on 20 hours of sleep

32:13.580 --> 32:15.649
and a week of running, you're
gonna have to learn how to

32:15.650 --> 32:18.109
balance your water intake
with the amount of weight

32:18.110 --> 32:20.869
you can carry, you're gonna
have to get through this on

32:20.870 --> 32:24.459
25,000 calories, just to survive.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.360
And then, of course, there's the heat.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.979
Getting lost, eaten by a
wild animal in the Bush.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.214
I mean, do you really, really want this?

32:34.215 --> 32:36.334
And are you ready for this?

32:36.335 --> 32:37.435
That sounds awesome.

32:59.810 --> 33:02.810
Could all runners
please come to the starting line.

33:16.071 --> 33:18.009
Right, everyone.

33:18.010 --> 33:21.613
If anyone is still unclear,
now's the time to pay attention.

33:24.490 --> 33:27.609
If you're stationary for
more than seven hours,

33:27.610 --> 33:29.893
you're disqualified
and we can pick you up.

33:32.351 --> 33:35.437
You press your panic
buttons, we come pick you up.

33:36.700 --> 33:39.749
If you leave the route
for more than 20 miles,

33:39.750 --> 33:40.833
we can pick you up.

33:43.440 --> 33:47.189
Water points are more than a
four-marathon distance apart.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.190
Plan accordingly.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.080
Don't be stupid.

33:54.220 --> 33:56.163
Runners have died attempting this race.

33:58.380 --> 33:59.709
Please go check your starting times

33:59.710 --> 34:00.960
on the roster over there.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
Good luck.

34:12.290 --> 34:13.290
No.

34:14.730 --> 34:15.730
No.

34:17.060 --> 34:18.060
No.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.748
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.289
No, I want that.

34:23.290 --> 34:24.266
What're you gonna do with that?

34:24.268 --> 34:25.703
You gonna read in the dark?

34:27.030 --> 34:29.228
You've got your headlamp for that.

34:29.230 --> 34:31.289
Definitely no.

34:31.290 --> 34:33.513
No, that's non-negotiable.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.590
Suppose that's smart.

34:42.221 --> 34:44.329
A spare pair of shoes,
where's the other one?

34:44.330 --> 34:45.538
There isn't one.

34:45.539 --> 34:46.708
How're you gonna run with one shoe?

34:46.710 --> 34:49.150
Just don't ask, just put it in the bag.

34:53.399 --> 34:55.027
And these?

34:55.029 --> 34:56.958
Girl's got to have a little luxury.

34:56.958 --> 34:59.459
- It's unnecessary weight.
- It's very necessary.

35:00.710 --> 35:01.710
You only need one.

35:03.980 --> 35:08.980
Right, this is by far going
to be your heaviest pack.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.233
Six liters.

35:11.223 --> 35:13.852
Six liters, why so much?

35:13.853 --> 35:15.589
Well, a normal
person needs two liters,

35:15.590 --> 35:17.715
and that's sitting at a desk.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.119
Yeah, well, I'm not normal.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.059
Say that again.

35:22.060 --> 35:23.239
You're gonna need all
of this to get through

35:23.240 --> 35:25.149
to the first pit stop, okay?

35:25.150 --> 35:28.875
You know, I think three
liters should be fine.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.933
I mean, look at this, I got all this.

35:32.026 --> 35:35.333
You're not starting this
race without four liters.

35:36.270 --> 35:37.573
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

35:38.818 --> 35:40.149
Right.

35:40.150 --> 35:41.449
Now.

35:41.450 --> 35:44.743
This little sucker is gonna
be your best friend, okay?

35:46.140 --> 35:49.049
It'll let us know that
you are still in the race,

35:49.050 --> 35:53.213
and more importantly,
that you're still alive.

35:54.170 --> 35:55.003
Okay?

35:55.004 --> 35:56.682
- This is gonna annoy me.
- Yes, it's gonna annoy you.

35:56.683 --> 35:59.649
It's gonna irritate you, but
no matter how much it does,

35:59.650 --> 36:01.550
do not take it off, do you understand?

36:02.546 --> 36:03.949
Yes, sir.

36:03.950 --> 36:05.069
No, I mean it.

36:05.070 --> 36:06.277
Never take it off.

36:09.895 --> 36:12.728
All right, let's get this pack on.

36:13.807 --> 36:14.807
Got it.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.086
How does that feel?

36:20.087 --> 36:23.233
Feels better than an oxygen cylinder.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.900
Okay, well um...

36:31.780 --> 36:33.403
That's you, you're up.

36:34.829 --> 36:37.129
If I don't see you at the...

36:37.130 --> 36:39.836
At the last pit stop, I'll be very angry.

36:41.149 --> 36:42.956
Not as angry as I'll be.

36:42.957 --> 36:44.286
Okay.

36:44.287 --> 36:45.704
- Okay.
- Thank you.

36:48.980 --> 36:49.980
Mary?

36:56.270 --> 36:57.689
Where'd you find that?

36:57.690 --> 37:00.709
- You left it behind.
- Yeah, with good reason.

37:00.710 --> 37:01.710
Take it.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.540
Please.

37:20.090 --> 37:21.240
You're a good doctor.

37:46.337 --> 37:49.596
Your water, just measure your water.

37:49.597 --> 37:52.788
And Mary, Mary, pace yourself, okay?

37:52.789 --> 37:53.622
88.

37:53.622 --> 37:54.622
Ready?

38:22.080 --> 38:23.403
Pace yourself, Mary!

38:29.420 --> 38:33.229
They say, for all humans
to come to Africa,

38:33.230 --> 38:34.613
is for them to come home.

38:37.770 --> 38:39.963
Mary must have felt that better than most.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.169
Alone, in the wilderness,
surrounded by the ancient Bush

38:46.170 --> 38:47.880
and its wild animals.

40:34.970 --> 40:35.970
Mary.

40:37.728 --> 40:39.189
- Hi!
- Mary.

40:39.190 --> 40:40.403
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

40:41.258 --> 40:42.091
Thank you.

40:42.092 --> 40:44.706
Here, I can take that for you.

40:44.707 --> 40:45.819
Oh, guess what?

40:45.820 --> 40:48.737
I saw a cheetah.

40:48.738 --> 40:49.788
- A cheetah?
- Yeah!

40:50.858 --> 40:52.929
I was a little freaked out
and then an elephant came

40:52.930 --> 40:55.049
and scared him away.

40:55.050 --> 40:57.109
I see, well, you need
some water, sit down.

40:57.110 --> 41:00.219
- You don't believe me.
- No, I believe you.

41:00.220 --> 41:02.259
Elephants, cheetahs, the
whole nine yards, yes.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.260
Have some water.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.365
Oh, oh, thank you.

41:06.366 --> 41:07.366
Go ahead.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.913
Slowly, slowly.

41:11.367 --> 41:12.367
Right.

41:13.247 --> 41:14.947
You still have 12 more legs to go.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.833
I did miscalculate the water.

41:21.036 --> 41:22.886
Just a little dehydrated, that's all.

41:25.223 --> 41:27.183
- It's so hot out there.
- I know, I know, I know.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.203
It's hotter than
I thought it would be.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.880
Let me help you with that.

41:55.284 --> 41:59.201
You know, I keep hearing
footsteps behind me.

42:03.625 --> 42:06.958
Every time I turned around, it was gone.

42:12.384 --> 42:13.634
Who?

42:15.123 --> 42:16.123
Matt.

42:40.932 --> 42:41.932
Hey.

42:43.111 --> 42:44.721
Hey.

42:44.722 --> 42:45.805
Are you okay?

42:55.823 --> 42:57.390
You're okay.

42:57.391 --> 42:58.391
You're okay.

43:32.070 --> 43:34.079
Strength isn't measured

43:34.080 --> 43:36.283
by how much you can take before you break.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.440
It's how much you can
take after you're broken.

44:10.362 --> 44:11.362
Hey.

44:12.341 --> 44:14.591
- Hey.
- Is everything okay?

44:16.381 --> 44:17.969
Yeah.

44:17.970 --> 44:20.799
Yeah, it's an old injury.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.697
Haven't felt it in years.

44:21.698 --> 44:23.309
That's the problem with injuries.

44:23.310 --> 44:26.310
If they don't heal properly
they show up at the worst times.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.409
I thought it had healed.

44:29.410 --> 44:31.363
This race shows all our cracks.

44:32.450 --> 44:34.163
Come, run with me.

44:35.970 --> 44:38.502
No, no, I'll just slow you down.

44:38.503 --> 44:42.020
I'm not here for a place
on a podium, come on.

44:43.941 --> 44:44.941
Come on.

45:00.540 --> 45:01.623
Matching scars.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.373
Yeah, how'd you get yours?

45:06.750 --> 45:07.950
I'll tell you someday.

45:09.850 --> 45:11.350
Is that what brought you here?

45:13.269 --> 45:14.419
What?

45:14.420 --> 45:15.420
Your scars.

45:18.230 --> 45:19.230
In a way.

45:23.100 --> 45:24.813
My husband and I, we uh,

45:25.870 --> 45:28.449
dreamed of running this race together.

45:28.450 --> 45:29.700
Why didn't you?

45:31.942 --> 45:32.942
He died.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.219
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

45:36.220 --> 45:38.313
No, no, no, it's okay.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.340
He's with God now.

45:47.132 --> 45:48.142
Yeah.

45:48.143 --> 45:50.393
Yeah, I wish believed that.

46:10.153 --> 46:11.653
How's she doing?

46:15.210 --> 46:17.869
She is stationary.

46:17.870 --> 46:19.620
Between water points two and three.

46:22.310 --> 46:23.310
Wait a minute.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.480
She just started moving again.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.279
Okay, thank you.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.280
Yeah.

47:02.294 --> 47:03.294
Hey.

47:04.515 --> 47:08.182
You need to get going
before the heat comes.

47:10.833 --> 47:13.233
I don't know why we
do this to ourselves.

47:14.510 --> 47:16.699
Sometimes wonder if being a bit mad

47:16.700 --> 47:19.322
isn't the most important
part of being human.

47:19.323 --> 47:22.630
Yeah, well, you got to be
mad to get fun outta this.

47:23.950 --> 47:27.339
God made me for a purpose,
but he also made me fast,

47:27.340 --> 47:29.673
and when I run, I feel his pleasure.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.449
It's hard to imagine a joyful God.

47:34.450 --> 47:36.959
Mary, if we turn to
God only when we suffer,

47:36.960 --> 47:39.060
we forget that he's there in our joy, too.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.773
Well, you're just a regular
fortune cookie now, aren't ya?

47:43.633 --> 47:45.672
I'm going to stop for a bit.

47:45.673 --> 47:46.899
You can go ahead.

47:46.900 --> 47:48.459
Why?

47:48.460 --> 47:49.460
I'm going to pray.

47:50.790 --> 47:53.029
Could you wanna do
that while we're walking?

47:53.030 --> 47:54.713
I could, but I choose not to.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.162
Don't worry, I'll catch up again.

48:00.740 --> 48:01.890
We'll see about that.

48:13.590 --> 48:16.369
Running is the loneliest sport.

48:16.370 --> 48:19.413
It's just you, the road, and God.

48:20.320 --> 48:23.219
You fight against the road, the elements,

48:23.220 --> 48:25.195
but mostly against yourself.

48:29.050 --> 48:31.403
It is here that the
true strength is shown.

48:32.460 --> 48:36.049
When, and against all odds,
you push yourself farther

48:36.050 --> 48:37.803
than even you thought you could go.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.406
Mary.

48:58.950 --> 49:00.572
What, what's wrong?

49:02.215 --> 49:03.243
ICBs.

49:03.244 --> 49:05.209
Oh, damn it.

49:05.210 --> 49:07.369
The iliotibial band.

49:07.370 --> 49:08.463
It's no joke, Mary.

49:09.490 --> 49:10.615
Come on, hold onto me.

49:10.616 --> 49:12.585
I had this problem in the past.

49:12.586 --> 49:14.119
It just started all of a sudden.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.169
Well, let's get you
into the tent and lie down.

49:16.170 --> 49:19.223
I'll strap you up, get some
leg support there, okay?

49:20.578 --> 49:21.661
Take it easy.

49:31.349 --> 49:32.349
Okay.

49:41.136 --> 49:42.136
All right.

49:49.756 --> 49:53.339
You don't have to break
yourself, you know.

49:54.540 --> 49:56.556
There's no shame in stopping.

49:56.557 --> 49:57.557
Right now.

50:00.690 --> 50:03.964
You've obviously never been a runner.

50:03.965 --> 50:05.065
Well, obviously not.

50:07.200 --> 50:10.267
Think I'll live longer for it.

50:10.268 --> 50:11.617
Right.

50:11.618 --> 50:12.966
How are you for water?

50:12.967 --> 50:14.402
Oh, yeah.

50:14.403 --> 50:18.089
I did better with rationing
my water this time.

50:18.090 --> 50:22.084
Well, a work in progress,
I'll go get you some more, okay?

50:22.085 --> 50:23.085
Thank you.

52:06.547 --> 52:07.547
Mary.

52:08.337 --> 52:10.587
Here, let me take your bag.

52:24.318 --> 52:25.318
Oh, my god.

52:29.300 --> 52:32.109
You don't expect me to allow
you to go on like this, huh?

52:32.110 --> 52:34.779
I mean, you can't want
to carry on like this.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.680
Of course I do, it's just a blister.

52:38.260 --> 52:39.829
You don't have to prove
anything to anybody.

52:39.830 --> 52:42.035
You've gone above and beyond...

52:42.036 --> 52:44.399
Why do you keep doin' that, huh?

52:44.400 --> 52:45.789
Try to dissuade me from finishing.

52:45.790 --> 52:47.229
What happened to the guy who pushed me?

52:47.230 --> 52:48.230
I'm worried.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.739
Yeah, well you have to let
me make my own decisions.

52:52.740 --> 52:55.073
Otherwise, I'm no better
than an invalid again.

52:58.540 --> 53:00.140
You can't fault me for caring.

53:01.670 --> 53:05.269
I appreciate that, but I
also need you to believe in me.

53:05.270 --> 53:06.270
Okay?

53:06.940 --> 53:08.973
This is the last stretch left.

53:10.010 --> 53:12.410
Yeah, but the last
stretch is often the worst.

53:14.780 --> 53:16.113
I can do this.

53:24.920 --> 53:25.920
Okay.

53:27.150 --> 53:28.999
You wait here, okay?

53:29.000 --> 53:30.559
Can we get some water here, please?

53:30.560 --> 53:31.560
Thanks.

53:44.670 --> 53:45.670
What is that?

53:46.870 --> 53:50.293
This is tincture of benzoin, all right?

53:51.255 --> 53:52.883
Used by the Special Forces.

53:54.809 --> 53:55.809
Hold still.

53:59.828 --> 54:02.587
Don't move.

54:02.588 --> 54:03.588
Hold still.

54:04.409 --> 54:05.409
Really?

54:06.700 --> 54:08.080
Suck it all out.

54:13.837 --> 54:16.309
Now, this is gonna hurt.

54:16.310 --> 54:17.310
A lot.

54:18.470 --> 54:19.470
Hold still, okay?

54:22.788 --> 54:23.788
Hold still!

54:32.770 --> 54:33.770
How's your foot?

54:35.769 --> 54:37.859
It's feeling a lot better.

54:37.860 --> 54:38.860
Yeah.

54:40.690 --> 54:42.799
I wonder where Raphaela is.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.550
She should've been right behind me.

54:45.729 --> 54:47.337
Who's Raphaela?

54:47.338 --> 54:49.688
Oh, this girl from
Brazil I was running with.

54:51.418 --> 54:52.418
Okay.

54:54.618 --> 54:56.319
You got your water, GPS, everything?

54:56.320 --> 54:57.795
- Yeah.
- Good.

54:57.796 --> 54:59.486
- I should get goin'.
- All right.

54:59.487 --> 55:01.606
I've lost a lot of time.

55:01.607 --> 55:03.515
All right, thank you.

55:03.516 --> 55:04.516
Okay.

55:52.832 --> 55:53.832
Go away!

55:57.632 --> 55:58.632
Go away!

55:59.686 --> 56:02.269
Get outta here, get outta here!

56:03.286 --> 56:04.536
Get outta here!

56:14.600 --> 56:17.400
I'm not sure why
I always expected the worst.

56:21.140 --> 56:22.599
Maybe because it prepares you

56:22.600 --> 56:24.250
for when it's actually happening.

56:28.818 --> 56:30.401
I'll be with you.

56:34.893 --> 56:36.693
It's no use hanging around anymore.

56:37.540 --> 56:39.209
The signal's been stationary
for three hours now.

56:39.210 --> 56:40.660
She's probably gone to sleep.

56:42.330 --> 56:44.430
You should try get some shut-eye yourself.

56:45.840 --> 56:48.358
I'll wake you if she starts moving again.

56:48.359 --> 56:49.359
Thanks.

58:08.970 --> 58:09.970
Morning.

58:12.987 --> 58:15.137
You'll be happy to know
she's moving again.

58:16.820 --> 58:17.990
All right.

58:17.991 --> 58:20.208
Here you go, have something.

58:20.209 --> 58:21.209
Thank you.

59:42.872 --> 59:43.872
What is it?

59:47.010 --> 59:49.589
Her GPS signal has stopped
again for over four hours.

59:49.590 --> 59:54.569
Don't worry, so have all the others, okay?

59:54.570 --> 59:58.132
- Is it a glitch?
- No.

59:58.133 --> 59:59.389
It's the heat.

59:59.390 --> 01:00:00.390
Heat?

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.663
Likely it's pushing
110 degrees out there.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.323
They probably all stopped to
find shelter and wait it out.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:17.790
Scorpion.

01:00:19.055 --> 01:00:21.539
Whatever happens, if you
get stung by a scorpion,

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.839
don't try and cut the wound
or suck the poison out.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.340
You'll only make things worse.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.239
Most scorpion stings
will not kill an adult.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.240
It'll be painful, but it won't kill you.

01:00:42.928 --> 01:00:44.428
Excruciating pain.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:47.222
Involuntary movements.

01:00:49.168 --> 01:00:50.168
Tremors.

01:00:51.637 --> 01:00:53.220
Difficulty walking.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.130
Hallucinations.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.210
You could even end up with a seizure.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.633
Okay, the moral of the story is,

01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:18.310
don't get bitten by a scorpion.

01:01:57.102 --> 01:01:58.102
Matt.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.790
Mary.

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:03.791
Matt.

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:07.515
Come on.

01:02:18.407 --> 01:02:19.574
Matt!

01:02:35.037 --> 01:02:36.123
What's the matter?

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.629
She's moving.

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:44.759
Moving?

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.800
- What's the time?
- It's past midnight.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.189
Maybe she's running
in the cool of the night

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.240
so she can get ahead.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120
Yeah.

01:02:54.832 --> 01:02:57.032
Except, she's moving
in the wrong direction.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.183
What do you mean?

01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:03.383
I'll show you.

01:03:03.384 --> 01:03:04.384
Come.

01:03:55.975 --> 01:03:56.975
Matt!

01:03:58.724 --> 01:03:59.724
Matt!

01:04:12.412 --> 01:04:16.339
Okay, so, this is where she
was when she stopped, right?

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.369
And when we started going
again, she head out this way.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:19.370
Due east.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.090
It's the wrong way.

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:23.476
Yeah, well maybe, um...

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.793
Maybe she's taken a shortcut.

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.110
There are no shortcuts.

01:04:32.403 --> 01:04:34.921
What do you want us to do?

01:04:34.922 --> 01:04:36.479
What do you mean?

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.680
We could send out a
team to intercept her.

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:41.319
In the dark?

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.613
Won't be easy.

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:45.000
It's our only option.

01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.629
No, no, then you'd disqualify her.

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.093
Better disqualified than dead.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:04.123
No, let's give her till the morning.

01:05:04.124 --> 01:05:05.124
Okay.

01:05:05.993 --> 01:05:07.253
Morning it is.

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:21.899
If you happen to come
across a lion in the Bush,

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.379
which is unlikely, because they
like to keep to themselves,

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.380
don't run.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.113
He'll only chase you down and eat you.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.989
Make yourself large, make some noise,

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:42.973
and hope that it goes away.

01:07:47.922 --> 01:07:49.709
How long is this gonna last?

01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:52.429
It'll pass quickly enough,
always does in the Bush.

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.900
Well, how long is "quickly enough?"

01:07:55.926 --> 01:07:57.079
It's been a waiting game.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.080
10 minutes, half-hour, it's hard to say.

01:08:02.872 --> 01:08:04.597
- I'm gonna go search for her.
- Don't be stupid.

01:08:04.598 --> 01:08:06.106
I can't leave her out there.

01:08:06.107 --> 01:08:08.796
You go out there, the
can't help you.

01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:10.630
Is that what you want?

01:11:03.383 --> 01:11:08.051
She hasn't moved, has she?

01:11:08.052 --> 01:11:09.219
No.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.969
No, she hasn't moved.

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:13.070
Don't worry, we'll find her.

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:21.189
Straight, straight, stop!

01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:22.834
- There, there.
- Stop there, stop.

01:11:22.835 --> 01:11:23.903
What?

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:24.784
There's no one here, there's nothing.

01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:26.423
- Mary!
- Coffin.

01:11:26.424 --> 01:11:27.424
This way.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.203
Over here, over here.

01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:31.287
- Mary!
- Where?

01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:39.882
What?

01:11:41.141 --> 01:11:43.058
It's working perfectly.

01:11:44.922 --> 01:11:46.071
Mary!

01:11:46.072 --> 01:11:47.072
Mary?

01:11:48.653 --> 01:11:49.653
Mary!

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:56.050
Coffin.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.110
We're wasting our time.

01:13:00.053 --> 01:13:01.613
What do you mean, we're wasting time?

01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:04.590
She could be anywhere.

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:13.599
Look, we have to go back.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.520
What if she's out here?

01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:16.959
- What if she's stuck out here?
- But we have to go back.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:20.013
So we can get fully
mobilized, please, trust me.

01:14:19.627 --> 01:14:23.133
You're going to come this
far to die from food poisoning?

01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:35.047
I'm so hungry.

01:14:42.705 --> 01:14:44.369
Where did you come from?

01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:45.370
You're lost.

01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:48.653
Coffin will be worried about you.

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:53.462
Coffin.

01:14:59.474 --> 01:15:01.532
How do you know about Coffin?

01:15:01.533 --> 01:15:06.533
Come on, we need to get going.

01:15:07.993 --> 01:15:08.993
Come on.

01:15:10.684 --> 01:15:12.267
Come on, good girl.

01:15:14.505 --> 01:15:15.505
Good girl.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.683
Have you had caviar?

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:28.943
No, no, I didn't think so.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.223
It's fishes' eggs, fish eggs.

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:37.803
And people, they pay thousands
of dollars for fishes' eggs.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.163
Matt wanted it at the
wedding, had to have it.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.743
Was trying to be fancy.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:53.839
God, he was so
uncomfortable in his tuxedo.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.163
He was like, so stiff.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.659
I told him we should just get
married in our tennis shoes,

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.879
but yeah, he was afraid of my mom.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.070
My mom wouldn't have liked that.

01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:40.439
All right, team, let's look sharp!

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.899
First runners are
approaching the finish line.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.367
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:45.770
Let's go!

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.562
Hey, sorry, boss,
have you seen this girl?

01:17:44.563 --> 01:17:46.563
Have you seen this girl?

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.169
Hey, have you seen this girl?

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.899
Her name's Mary.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.282
Mary, have you seen this girl?

01:17:58.283 --> 01:18:03.951
Just look, look at the... Damn.

01:18:15.677 --> 01:18:17.427
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.079
Just look at the picture!

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.738
Just take her away.

01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:27.860
Please, have you seen this girl?

01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:30.380
Have a look at this picture, come on!

01:18:30.381 --> 01:18:32.329
- Coffin, Coffin!
- Okay, okay!

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:34.058
- Okay!
- Come on!

01:18:34.059 --> 01:18:35.059
Okay!

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.358
I'm sorry.

01:18:42.359 --> 01:18:43.359
I'm sorry.

01:18:50.808 --> 01:18:52.079
Raphaela.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.782
Raphaela was running right behind Mary.

01:18:53.783 --> 01:18:55.579
- Raphaela?
- Has Raphaela come in?

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.727
Maybe she knows...
Raphaela Desullo?

01:18:57.728 --> 01:19:00.769
- I don't know, the Brazilian!
- She was a Brazilian runner.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:05.020
What're you talking about,
"she was a Brazilian?"

01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:08.530
She died in this race two years ago.

01:19:10.039 --> 01:19:11.417
What do you mean, she died?

01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:12.251
What're you talking about,

01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:14.119
"she died in this race two years ago?"

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.743
She was running right
behind, right behind Mary.

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.537
She was attacked by a lion.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.783
Mary said she was running
with her, running with her!

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:34.636
It's not possible.

01:20:29.608 --> 01:20:30.608
Mary?

01:20:53.205 --> 01:20:54.205
Drink.

01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:17.962
Don't be afraid.

01:21:22.389 --> 01:21:23.556
Who are you?

01:22:03.854 --> 01:22:04.854
Mary.

01:22:09.995 --> 01:22:14.995
Hey.

01:22:16.726 --> 01:22:18.643
You just let him die.

01:22:19.904 --> 01:22:20.904
For nothing.

01:22:28.363 --> 01:22:29.363
Hey.

01:22:32.594 --> 01:22:33.927
Don't be afraid.

01:22:36.643 --> 01:22:37.643
Okay?

01:22:48.866 --> 01:22:50.086
Matt!

01:22:50.087 --> 01:22:51.526
Matt, doctor!

01:22:51.527 --> 01:22:52.527
Matt!

01:22:54.007 --> 01:22:55.625
Matt!

01:22:55.626 --> 01:22:56.876
Where were you?

01:23:00.437 --> 01:23:01.687
Where were you?

01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:09.073
I'm there every time
someone cries or fails.

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:12.110
Or gives up.

01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:15.839
And there for every tragedy.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.329
You're okay.

01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:19.119
And every piece of meaningless suffering

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.013
that humans inflict on each other.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.553
I am there, suffering with you.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040
Every moment.

01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:37.929
I was there when you cursed me.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:38.930
I hate you!

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:41.970
When you turned your back.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.120
I'll be there every moment of your life.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.493
Begging you to love me again.

01:23:52.658 --> 01:23:55.329
I can't have love without freedom.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:59.087
And true freedom will always
entail some suffering.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.763
I loved him so much.

01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:06.303
You'll see him again.

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:11.820
Not yet.

01:24:19.661 --> 01:24:21.244
You need to let go.

01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:33.530
Don't be afraid.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.240
When you run through the
fire, you will not be burned.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:05.114
The Furnace was made to purify God.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.790
No, no, please, leave it.

01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:23.929
Please can you leave that, please?

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:25.329
I was told to take them all off.

01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:26.663
Just leave it!

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:33.010
Where is he?

01:25:33.011 --> 01:25:34.649
Coffin.

01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:36.509
You're gonna wanna come see this.

01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:37.510
- Come on!
- Okay.

01:25:45.543 --> 01:25:46.543
Look.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.840
It's Mary.

01:25:57.561 --> 01:25:58.769
Coffin!

01:25:58.770 --> 01:25:59.770
She made it.

01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:01.689
She made it.

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.036
- It's a miracle.
- Yeah.

01:26:03.037 --> 01:26:04.736
Coffin!

01:26:04.737 --> 01:26:06.513
- Let's go get her.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:08.055
Coffin!

01:26:08.056 --> 01:26:09.734
Let her finish.

01:26:09.735 --> 01:26:11.364
Yeah.

01:26:11.365 --> 01:26:12.365
Coffin!

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.429
Guys, uh, please put it back up, guys.

01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:20.139
Please, huh?

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.243
Put it back up!

01:26:22.546 --> 01:26:23.546
Coffin!

01:26:29.175 --> 01:26:34.175
Coffin!

01:26:40.605 --> 01:26:45.605
Coffin!

01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:13.819
Bet you've never been so happy

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.097
to see a cylinder in your life again, eh?

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.902
Careful, careful.

01:27:22.903 --> 01:27:25.084
You did it.

01:27:25.085 --> 01:27:26.085
You did it.

01:27:29.533 --> 01:27:30.533
No.

01:27:31.353 --> 01:27:34.391
We did it.

01:27:34.392 --> 01:27:35.392
We did it.

01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:59.760
Mary ran the Furnace
again the following year.
