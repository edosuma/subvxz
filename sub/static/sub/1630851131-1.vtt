05:09.000 --> 05:12.833
Hey, excuse me!
Have you seen my wallet somewhere?

05:16.500 --> 05:17.875
Sorry!

05:18.417 --> 05:20.125
Hi, have you found a wallet?

05:24.417 --> 05:25.500
Really?

05:26.292 --> 05:27.917
It’s a black leather wallet.

07:09.958 --> 07:14.958
Johannes Müller, yes.
My wallet got stolen.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.958
I’d like to block my credit card.

07:18.292 --> 07:20.333
Yes, ok.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.083
The IBAN?

07:23.876 --> 07:24.644
Erm...

07:27.083 --> 07:28.208
The number?

07:32.218 --> 07:34.485
What was that?

07:34.487 --> 07:34.921
Er, just, I have to...

07:39.025 --> 07:40.493
I have to block my cards, um...

07:42.829 --> 07:45.529
..because my wallet got stolen.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.965
I don't know.
Just a fucker,

07:47.967 --> 07:49.834
you know, stole...

07:49.836 --> 07:51.936
I'm sure you just lost it -
it's fine. It's gone.

07:51.938 --> 07:52.939
Yeah, sure. How do you
know that, that I lost it?

07:55.842 --> 07:59.109
Oh, fuck, man, I don't know.
You think I'm stupid and rich?

07:59.111 --> 08:00.213
No, I think you're
clever and poor.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.582
I cannot believe it, man.

08:04.584 --> 08:05.518
It's the second time this
summer I lost my wallet.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.253
Same procedure, all over again.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.191
Oh.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.025
- Oh, holy shit.
- What?

08:15.027 --> 08:16.727
I've been in this club
for, like, two days.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.496
- Classy!
- I'm leaving Berlin tonight.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.030
I haven't seen
any of the city

08:20.032 --> 08:21.499
and I need to print my
fucking boarding pass.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.567
Yeah.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.136
I can show you around
if you like.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.106
Really? You don't...
You don't have to.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.175
Yeah, I think I would be a fool
if I wouldn't.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.762
Oh, OK.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.131
- So, list game.
- Yeah?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.699
- Yeah.
- Let's go for it.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.635
Erm...

10:37.637 --> 10:39.236
Dixis or actual toilets?

10:39.238 --> 10:41.071
What?

10:41.073 --> 10:41.641
I saw a Dixi over there.
I don't know.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.277
- Er, anal or oral?
- You didn't answer my question,

10:47.279 --> 10:49.079
- so I will not answer yours.
- Answer my question.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.814
What was your question?
I didn't hear.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.150
OK, so, hummus or
peanut butter?

10:53.152 --> 10:56.687
Hummus. Anal or oral?

10:56.689 --> 10:58.422
You said that before.
You asked...

10:58.424 --> 11:00.157
You didn't answer it.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.792
You don't ask the question
twice, so I am.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.761
Minus point for you.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.195
Oh, wow!

11:05.197 --> 11:07.364
So, sunrise or sunset?

11:07.366 --> 11:08.267
Er...

11:10.336 --> 11:12.238
Sunset. Having a blow job

11:13.105 --> 11:15.939
or getting a blow job? Sorry.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.443
Giving a blow job or having
a blow job given to you?

11:23.716 --> 11:24.016
I can't... I can't hear you.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.451
Er...

11:27.453 --> 11:28.752
- That's a hard one.
- Is it?

11:28.754 --> 11:30.054
Ha-ha! No pun intended.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.960
Ah, let's say both. So, um...

11:37.196 --> 11:39.196
Are you getting hard?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.998
I am getting slightly hard,
yeah. Do you wanna...

11:41.000 --> 11:42.933
- Oh, fuck.
- ..sit back a little?

11:42.935 --> 11:44.303
No, no. I will crash into
a tree if you touch me.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.374
OK. Top or bottom?

11:50.776 --> 11:52.843
Er...

11:52.845 --> 11:53.813
Oh, we have green light.
Let's go.

12:02.054 --> 12:02.822
Hello.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.625
- May I have a computer, please?
- Hi! Yes. Number ten.

12:06.833 --> 12:07.875
Thanks!

12:08.294 --> 12:10.094
I fucking love these places.
They're so '90s.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.795
- Yeah?
- I remember, like,

12:11.797 --> 12:13.997
the first cyber internet cafe
in Nottingham

12:13.999 --> 12:15.234
and I used to have all these
international cyber boyfriends

12:16.268 --> 12:17.501
and we used to
talk to each other

12:17.503 --> 12:20.070
in a disgustingly dirty way.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.873
Oh-ho! So, you jerked off in
public on Windows 95 or what?

12:22.875 --> 12:24.775
Who do you think I am?

12:24.777 --> 12:25.311
It was Windows 97.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.216
Oh. It's Harry Munro.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.917
Mm.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.452
Well, hello, nice to meet you,

12:35.454 --> 12:37.387
Mr Harry Munro.
I'm your biggest fan.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.456
- Nice to meet you.
- Can I have an autograph?

12:39.458 --> 12:42.292
No, you can't. It's nice to
meet you too, though, Mr...

12:42.294 --> 12:42.928
Wait. Let me... Let me guess.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.097
Daniel?

12:47.032 --> 12:47.833
Callum?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.535
No, no, I've got it.

12:51.537 --> 12:52.936
Adolf.

12:54.406 --> 12:55.506
Yes, please.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.541
It's Johannes.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.277
Nice to meet you, Mr Johannes.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.813
OK, so, my flight is at 11pm...

13:02.815 --> 13:04.481
- Mm.
- ..from Sho-nen-field.

13:04.483 --> 13:05.916
Sch nefeld.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.417
From Sho-ne...

13:07.419 --> 13:08.952
Sch nefeld.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.120
Sch nefell?

13:10.122 --> 13:12.322
Sch nefeld.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.358
- I really couldn't give a shit.
- Oh, OK.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.492
My flight's at 11pm
from Sch nefeld.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.261
Sch nefeld.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.229
Oh, for fuck's sake.

13:19.231 --> 13:20.364
I've got, like, a million
e-mails from work.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.233
Oh.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.867
I'm not gonna bother
with that now.

13:23.869 --> 13:24.336
Let me just check one thing.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.176
Oh, football.
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:32.178 --> 13:33.312
Oh, fuck, yes,
we beat the bastards!

13:35.147 --> 13:36.580
Don't you like sport?

13:36.582 --> 13:38.482
Yes, but not football.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.818
I like elegant sport -

13:40.820 --> 13:42.886
- for example, gymnastics.
- Mm-hm.

13:42.888 --> 13:43.889
- Synchronised swimming or...
- Mm-hm.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.927
I'll show you something.
This is insane.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.095
- You know about diving?
- Mm.

13:52.097 --> 13:56.268
And the bodies
of these athletes

13:57.136 --> 13:59.503
are, like, from another planet.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.071
Look at this.

14:17.957 --> 14:18.891
- That's amazing.
- Mm.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.028
Shame it was
Nazi propaganda, though.

14:25.130 --> 14:28.198
Wait - why don't you
like football?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.168
Oh, you know, 11 idiots running
after a ball and both teams,

14:31.170 --> 14:33.170
too, are waiting for them

14:33.172 --> 14:35.038
and you need to put a ball
into a square.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.573
Like, I think there are

14:36.575 --> 14:38.542
more interesting things
in the world.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.378
OK, Mr Black-And-White Films.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.314
Don't tell me
it wasn't beautiful.

14:44.316 --> 14:45.883
- It was beautiful.
- I saw you cry.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.318
I didn't cry.
But it was beautiful.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.486
It was the reflection
in your glasses.

14:49.488 --> 14:52.022
OK, shut up.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.156
OK, what we doing now?
We've got 17 minutes left.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.260
Hmm...

14:55.127 --> 14:57.094
Let's make a photo and send it

14:57.096 --> 14:58.061
out in the universe
of the internet.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.464
- Boring!
- OK.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.033
Why don't we do a Chatroulette
instead? That sounds great.

15:03.035 --> 15:06.169
Chatroulette - what's that?
This website with, um,

15:06.171 --> 15:08.005
people in front of camera,
like, I don't know,

15:08.007 --> 15:09.640
- practising fisting...
- Mm-hm.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.375
- ..and gangbang and stuff?
- Yeah, exactly.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.144
- OK.
- What we should be doing.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.514
- Oh, shit.
- What?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.950
This does not have a computer
camera - that's so annoying.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.987
- Oh, no.
- I should've known that in 1990

15:24.490 --> 15:26.256
Well, thank you, Berlin.

15:26.258 --> 15:26.959
- Wait.
- Sorry.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.460
I have an idea.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.129
- Yeah, just...
- What?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.263
Take your face
and move it like this.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.564
Hey, be careful.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.166
Yeah, no, it's...

15:36.168 --> 15:37.567
- Don't move. That's perfect.
- OK.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.703
Hmm?

15:39.705 --> 15:42.172
Oh, just Paint still exist?

15:42.174 --> 15:43.373
It does indeed.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.276
Oh, wow!

15:47.379 --> 15:48.180
So gorgeous.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.286
Oh, you little bastard.
I look like a football...

15:55.587 --> 15:57.721
- I'm just drawing what I see.
- ..with Dumbo ears.

15:57.723 --> 15:59.990
Fuck you. Now it's my turn.

15:59.992 --> 16:00.693
- Turn and face...
- OK.

16:04.229 --> 16:07.064
See how Picasso
is drawing this.

16:07.066 --> 16:07.633
Picasso.

16:09.568 --> 16:10.634
I like it.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.403
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.072
Oh, that's not even funny.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.107
That's not even funny.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.408
Let's give it a blue
background.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.278
Yes.

16:20.713 --> 16:21.680
- Print.
- Mm.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.624
So...?

16:34.626 --> 16:36.693
So?

16:36.695 --> 16:38.996
Any other amazing ideas?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.299
Mm, I've got a few on my mind.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.067
- So, where next?
- We've got the tickets.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.168
Yes.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.005
Erm...

16:48.574 --> 16:50.440
What?

16:50.442 --> 16:52.242
Did... Did I not put
my bike here?

16:52.244 --> 16:53.543
Fuck!

16:53.545 --> 16:55.312
Oh, shit.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.215
- Erm...
- Erm... OK.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.283
Sorry.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.752
OK, we have to go to

17:01.754 --> 17:04.054
- the police straightaway.
- We can't.

17:04.056 --> 17:04.656
We're too high to go to
the police. Don't be stupid.

17:07.958 --> 17:13.958
[Harry tries to read in German.]

17:21.740 --> 17:22.775
- Oh!
- Sh!

17:39.158 --> 17:41.158
The German language is so sexy.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.226
Can you just speak to me in
German continuously?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.328
- Can you, please?
- I forgot all my language.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.164
You've forgotten all your
language but you know English?

17:47.166 --> 17:49.166
Yeah, but all the German
is gone.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.634
It's too much in my head.
Too much...

17:50.636 --> 17:51.435
Talk anyway...

17:51.667 --> 17:55.375
Car-wash-ma-chi-ne.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.833
Herr Müller?

17:59.478 --> 18:00.512
Hate to watch him go.

18:37.749 --> 18:38.750
Where were you?

18:40.419 --> 18:42.185
Fancied a smoke.

18:42.187 --> 18:42.688
Fair enough.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.125
It wasn't fun anyway, so...

18:48.127 --> 18:48.427
What did they say?

18:50.529 --> 18:51.396
Oh, there were some problems...

18:53.866 --> 18:57.667
..with my lost wallet,

18:57.669 --> 18:59.505
so I couldn't give my
personalities and so on.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.140
- I have to come again.
- Sorry.

19:03.142 --> 19:03.575
It's fine.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.279
Hmm. Please, let's do
something fun.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.514
- Yes!
- Drink prosecco?

19:10.516 --> 19:11.316
Yes!

19:13.652 --> 19:15.552
- Can we go back a bit, cos...
- OK.

19:15.554 --> 19:16.887
Let me get this straight -

19:16.889 --> 19:18.555
you actually genuinely think
that...

19:18.557 --> 19:20.423
That being gay puts you

19:20.425 --> 19:22.526
in a privileged position
in society?

19:22.528 --> 19:24.394
Yeah, I think we have
both brains develop

19:24.396 --> 19:26.429
and therefore
we have another sensibility.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.165
Oh, my gosh! Is that the same
sensibility as saying,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.766
oh, the same difference

19:29.768 --> 19:31.535
- between lilac and purple...
- Yes.

19:31.537 --> 19:32.903
..or being a master of
fashion at birth?

19:32.905 --> 19:35.238
It's just... No, no.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.507
This is just as stupid
as saying that

19:37.509 --> 19:40.243
every gay loves Barbra
Streisand or Judy Garland

19:40.245 --> 19:42.612
and who the fuck
listens to Judy Garland anyway?

19:42.614 --> 19:46.783
Identify split ends in women's
hair. Appreciating small boobs.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.586
Or watching Eurovision Song
Contest as gay revenge...

19:49.588 --> 19:51.488
- Yeah.
- ..for the World Cup.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.789
Yeah, yeah.
Cos all gays masturbate

19:52.791 --> 19:55.358
to the fucking Eurovision.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.693
Is there anything more straight
than the YMCA dance?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.762
♪ YMCA

19:58.764 --> 19:59.331
♪ It's fun to stay at the... ♪

19:59.865 --> 20:02.668
Wow! This is intense.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.470
Yeah.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.372
You know, there is nothing
worse than being

20:09.374 --> 20:10.974
surrounded by businessmen

20:10.976 --> 20:13.243
while you are high
or coming down.

20:13.245 --> 20:14.644
No. No, children.
Children are worse.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.513
Honestly, it's awful. I...

20:16.515 --> 20:18.248
I feel like a paedophile
and at any minute,

20:18.250 --> 20:20.684
someone's gonna
call me out on it.

20:20.686 --> 20:21.685
- Do you ever get that?
- No. Never.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.520
- No?
- No.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.223
But I will rescue you
from that.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.591
We are away from there
any minute.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.594
Mm. Oh, wow!

20:30.596 --> 20:33.797
This is a side of Berlin
that I haven't seen before.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.533
Lots of bankers
and fancy hotels -

20:36.535 --> 20:38.635
the new beating heart
of neoliberalism

20:38.637 --> 20:40.971
and the capital of Europe.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.440
Do you know, I find it cute.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.574
You find neoliberalism cute?

20:44.576 --> 20:45.344
No, kids.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.711
Oh! Fair enough.

20:47.713 --> 20:50.680
You know, my biggest dream
is to become a father.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.350
Your biggest dream
is to become a father?

20:51.783 --> 20:53.850
- Yes.
- Wow!

20:53.852 --> 20:55.719
You want to bring a kid into
this mess of a world

20:55.721 --> 20:56.488
- we live in.
- Oh, come on! I mean...

21:00.292 --> 21:02.926
- You think the world is a mess?
- Yeah.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.928
Yeah, yeah,
we are fucking the world up

21:04.930 --> 21:07.564
and the worst thing is that we
think we're doing a lot

21:07.566 --> 21:10.834
by reducing and reusing plastic
and it's not even about that.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.502
It's all about
the big companies

21:12.504 --> 21:13.338
and the politicians
who enable them.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.740
Like, I watched a documentary
the other day and it said...

21:16.742 --> 21:19.309
Another documentary - I know.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.911
It was saying that over 70% of
the world's greenhouse gases

21:21.913 --> 21:23.680
come from the word's
biggest 100 companies.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.048
- Yeah?
- We don't need more people.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.450
Yeah, but...

21:27.452 --> 21:29.052
I'm not sharing that thought.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.022
I mean, don't you think,
for example,

21:32.024 --> 21:35.892
our child could help the world,
being a better place?

21:35.894 --> 21:37.827
Sorry, did I just hear you say
"our child"?

21:37.829 --> 21:41.398
Oh! Yeah, ours, mine, yours.
I mean...

21:41.400 --> 21:42.499
Oh, hello.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.335
Mm.

21:43.869 --> 21:44.569
You know what I mean.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.078
So, my mother, you know, she...

21:55.714 --> 21:59.418
..raised me with so much
effort, energy and love...

22:02.554 --> 22:05.090
..that I think I need to pass
that on to somebody, you know?

22:07.025 --> 22:08.393
- That's cute.
- Thank you.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.631
So, if he's a he,

22:14.633 --> 22:18.601
we should call him Julian,
for Julian Assange.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.004
And if she's a she - and she
would definitely be a she -

22:21.006 --> 22:21.940
we should call her...

22:23.975 --> 22:25.709
..Cleopatra.

22:25.711 --> 22:26.878
What?! That's...
That's ridiculous.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.350
Maria Cleopatra M ller Munro.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.350
No, no, no, no.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.419
Maria Cleopatra Munro M ller.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.888
Maria Cleopatra Munro/M ller,
and here we go.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.790
Yeah. OK, then.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.361
A compromise -
I can work with that, I guess.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.363
- Wie geht es dir?
- Hi.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.708
We are not interested.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.901
One of you guys
sounds British - am I right?

22:51.903 --> 22:53.803
- Yeah, I'm from Devon. And you?
- Nice. Nottingham.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.005
Nice. And you're living here?

22:56.007 --> 22:57.674
No, I'm just here on
a weekend break.

22:57.676 --> 23:00.143
How... How about you guys?

23:00.145 --> 23:02.712
I joined the mission about
three months ago

23:02.714 --> 23:04.481
and, er, I'll be...
I'll be here for a year.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.950
Yeah.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.485
So, you're making
new friends or...?

23:08.487 --> 23:09.087
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

23:12.424 --> 23:12.858
So, what do you do?

23:14.993 --> 23:17.560
We just like to talk to people,

23:17.562 --> 23:21.431
answer their questions and...

23:21.433 --> 23:23.466
Do you think we need help?
I don't think so.

23:23.468 --> 23:24.169
We don't need help,
to be honest. So...

23:25.537 --> 23:27.537
Hold up, Johannes.
I'm... I'm interested.

23:27.539 --> 23:30.039
I guess my question would be...

23:30.041 --> 23:32.409
I don't know - why?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.177
You guys are young and this,
kind of, seems like,

23:34.179 --> 23:36.012
sort of old-fashioned.
But I get...

23:36.014 --> 23:37.680
If you believe in God,
everyone has the right

23:37.682 --> 23:39.582
to their own faith, but...

23:39.584 --> 23:41.718
I don't know.
Why study an ageing book

23:41.720 --> 23:44.187
that's full of, like,
obnoxious and boring people?

23:44.189 --> 23:46.156
And you must get abuse from
the general public as well.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.626
Like, why put yourselves
through that?

23:49.628 --> 23:52.595
Yeah, I understand what you're
saying but we believe that

23:52.597 --> 23:54.166
the people of this world
are suffering from

23:55.033 --> 23:58.201
a lack of faith and religion.

23:58.203 --> 24:01.004
Society is becoming, er,
more individualistic.

24:01.006 --> 24:04.140
And...

24:04.142 --> 24:08.144
religion is dying and nothing
is there to fill that void.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.746
Yeah, I agree - society's
lost something

24:09.748 --> 24:12.081
that holds us together

24:12.083 --> 24:13.185
and often, religion does a lot
of good things.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.453
Like, we see it
at work all the time.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.488
There are so many people that
don't have access

24:18.490 --> 24:21.524
to public health care or
services, like asylum seekers.

24:21.526 --> 24:23.726
And it's often religious people
or religious organisations

24:23.728 --> 24:25.462
that helps them out,
so, yeah, I...

24:25.464 --> 24:27.964
Sounds so cute and interesting,
right?

24:27.966 --> 24:31.000
What about eternal damnation?
Hmm?

24:31.002 --> 24:32.170
I know... I don't think
it will bother you

24:33.538 --> 24:36.005
but do we have a place
in paradise left for us?

24:36.007 --> 24:39.509
God loves all his children.

24:39.511 --> 24:42.545
There are many modern
interpretations of the Bible.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.748
And we believe there is a place
for the both of you in heaven.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.484
Oh, wow! You know what?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.718
I think I'd prefer it in hell,
you know?

24:48.720 --> 24:50.587
Kind of warm and sweaty,

24:50.589 --> 24:53.189
a lot of collars and harnesses

24:53.191 --> 24:55.558
and rings around
the cocks and...

24:55.560 --> 24:57.694
Really?
You're gonna go there now?

24:57.696 --> 24:59.229
- Yeah. Why not?
- Oh, no. You do you. It's fine.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.098
Maybe you just want one?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.702
Oh, yeah, they're always
perfect for a wrap. Thank you.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.706
- Right. OK. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.040
Have a lovely day.

25:11.042 --> 25:11.576
- You too. Nice to meet you.
- Ciao.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.180
OK.

25:51.182 --> 25:52.584
You are a Manchego.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.586
As in the cheese?

25:56.588 --> 25:59.122
Mm. Kind of intense and hard.

25:59.124 --> 26:01.858
Looks more like Camembert.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.259
I know. They didn't have a
Manchego here but still...

26:03.261 --> 26:05.762
Hmm.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.664
OK. Tell me about that and
where we're going with this.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.032
Everybody is a cheese.

26:09.034 --> 26:11.267
Not the cheese you like

26:11.269 --> 26:12.936
but you're kind of
human cheese.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.337
There are some people who are

26:14.339 --> 26:16.639
toxic and disgusting in a way.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.841
They're more like
blue cheese.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.110
And these super-boring
clean boys,

26:21.112 --> 26:22.213
they are more like Babybel.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.081
OK, so, everyone's a cheese?

26:25.083 --> 26:28.184
- Mm-hm.
- OK, let's go with that.

26:28.186 --> 26:31.588
And, um, what kind of cheese
would you be?

26:31.590 --> 26:35.325
Like, um, Philadelphia -
soft and sweet?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.260
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm a cheddar.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.329
Yeah, more, like,

26:39.331 --> 26:43.132
easy-going and tender.

26:43.134 --> 26:44.367
OK, you've thought about this
for far too long,

26:44.369 --> 26:46.269
far too long. Stop now.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.838
I have two weaknesses -

26:48.840 --> 26:51.941
good food and men,
in that order.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.944
The gospel according to Dolly.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.914
Mm. I can't stand all this
pretentious rubbish.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.750
You see it everywhere
in London.

27:00.752 --> 27:05.021
Like, a pop-up vegan bumhole
cum-filled soul-food fusion.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.289
- It's just ridiculous.
- Yeah?

27:06.291 --> 27:08.124
- I don't like it.
- No.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.093
I think it's cool, you know,
to have all these differences -

27:10.095 --> 27:12.762
kind of experimental.

27:12.764 --> 27:14.731
It's pushing the boundaries.

27:14.733 --> 27:17.800
It's bullshit.
OK, first of all,

27:17.802 --> 27:19.102
they rip you off and then they
hand you something

27:19.104 --> 27:21.004
the size of a Mentos.

27:21.006 --> 27:24.207
A Mentos.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.276
And what's even worse is this,
like, celebrity-chef culture.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.912
Every fucking middle-class
person in the UK has

27:29.914 --> 27:32.915
a copy of Ottolenghi's
cookbook for £20,

27:32.917 --> 27:35.752
and then they spend £50
on the fucking ingredients

27:35.754 --> 27:38.087
that they can't find
anywhere else,

27:38.089 --> 27:41.658
like sheep testicles marinated
in a bed of babies' tears.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.693
Gold saffron. All this shit
that you can never find...

27:43.695 --> 27:45.228
I don't know what you're
talking about.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.132
I'm sorry. Rant over.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.135
So, what we gonna do -
dine and dash?

27:52.137 --> 27:54.971
When and what?

27:54.973 --> 27:56.973
You've lost your wallet,
so I'm guessing

27:56.975 --> 27:58.941
all of this is on me, right?

27:58.943 --> 28:02.745
This is on the city of Berlin.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.114
How is the city of Berlin
funding our date?

28:05.116 --> 28:07.717
So, we went through
the back yard,

28:07.719 --> 28:10.420
and I've detected
some blind spots

28:10.422 --> 28:13.224
where we are invisible
for the reception, so...

28:14.259 --> 28:18.094
behave and then
everything will be fine.

28:18.096 --> 28:20.396
Hmm - if we behave,
everything will be fine.

28:20.398 --> 28:21.232
Isn't that sweet?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.400
Do you take all your
one-night stands here

28:24.402 --> 28:26.402
to make them feel special?

28:26.404 --> 28:30.909
No. I try to not come in here
more than once a month,

28:35.046 --> 28:36.846
Yeah, and the other thing -
I'm not doing it at all.

28:36.848 --> 28:37.382
Yeah, right.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.739
Mm-hm. What the fuck
are you doing?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.108
Are you giving me a footsie
with your cheap shoes?

29:05.110 --> 29:06.976
Mm.

29:06.978 --> 29:09.479
Oh, hello. Ooh!

29:09.481 --> 29:10.315
- Mm. Mm!
- Stop it.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.817
You're ruining my trousers, OK?

29:14.819 --> 29:17.386
It's a dirty business.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.756
And I'll get us a dessert now.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.226
Mm! Sit down.
I'll get this one.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.977
So, what are you doing?

29:40.979 --> 29:45.014
Hmm? I'm... enjoying
a continental breakfast

29:45.016 --> 29:48.417
while stroking the crotch
of a cute German boy.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.053
No, no, I mean
in ordinary life.

29:51.055 --> 29:53.823
Oh, I'm... I'm a doctor.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.958
Oh, what?
No, I don't believe you.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.794
Why not?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.530
I mean, the circumstances
we met?

30:00.532 --> 30:02.865
You don't give off
the doctor vibe so much.

30:02.867 --> 30:05.401
OK, and what is
the doctor vibe?

30:05.403 --> 30:09.272
Fuck! When you were talking
about work, work, work, work,

30:09.274 --> 30:13.509
I was imagining you, like,
working in a factory or,

30:13.511 --> 30:17.146
I don't know, as a butcher
cutting meat in thin slices

30:17.148 --> 30:21.417
with an overall, gloves and
a hairnet and things like that.

30:21.419 --> 30:24.153
OK, I guess it's the same sort
of uniform, but...

30:24.155 --> 30:25.123
OK, wow!

30:28.259 --> 30:30.193
You know what?
I always find this weird.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.862
Whenever I tell someone
I'm a doctor, I always get this

30:32.864 --> 30:35.364
same sort of reaction,
like I should be proud

30:35.366 --> 30:37.099
that I'm some
sort of an elitist.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.467
I should be waving
like the Queen.

30:38.469 --> 30:40.238
Like, "Oh, look at me.
Hello, hello."

30:40.972 --> 30:43.072
So, what are you doing?

30:43.074 --> 30:45.875
I am a junior doctor
working in A and E.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.610
A and E?

30:47.612 --> 30:49.147
It's like...
the emergency room.

30:50.615 --> 30:51.416
OK.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.587
So, how many lives
did you save recently?

30:57.589 --> 30:59.322
Can we not talk about that?
I didn't come to Berlin

30:59.324 --> 31:01.157
to talk about work, work, work.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.159
Sorry.

31:03.161 --> 31:06.996
But... wow! I mean,

31:06.998 --> 31:07.532
you've got your shit together.
I mean...

31:09.534 --> 31:11.200
Your parents must be proud.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.970
Mm. They're, um, unhappy,
but...

31:15.173 --> 31:15.607
..extremely proud.

31:18.009 --> 31:19.143
We should move on.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.046
Oh, shit, all right.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.521
- So close.
- Sorry.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.246
You know, I think this is the
first time I've been on a date

33:04.248 --> 33:05.583
without using Grindr or Tinder
or anything like that.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.993
I haven't been on any
Tinder date, to be honest.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.695
Really? Well, how about Grindr?

33:19.697 --> 33:22.498
Mm. I mean, I downloaded
the app for a while

33:22.500 --> 33:26.669
but I got bored of it
straightaway. And...

33:26.671 --> 33:28.072
Yeah, I don't know, for me
it's like cock shopping.

33:30.375 --> 33:35.745
Decent 24cm XXL top
says "hi".

33:35.747 --> 33:39.315
Or Super Sucker, 22,
is texting you,

33:39.317 --> 33:41.183
"Hi, wanna come over
and suck my dick?"

33:41.185 --> 33:43.619
And...

33:43.621 --> 33:46.290
Is there a more sophisticated
way to find sex?

33:47.025 --> 33:50.259
Oh, my God. OK. Firstly,

33:50.261 --> 33:52.795
I don't think that sex has to
be sophisticated.

33:52.797 --> 33:56.132
I mean, do you? And moreover,
I think you're generally just,

33:56.134 --> 33:58.267
like, clutching at straws.
I don't think it's that bad.

33:58.269 --> 33:59.604
I... Like, it's not always
like that, you know?

34:01.372 --> 34:02.073
Well, then...

34:03.741 --> 34:05.241
..show me your profile.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.045
OK. Here we go.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.580
- I'm surprised.
- Hmm?

34:11.581 --> 34:12.748
The first one's actually
quite cool.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.283
Thank you.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.186
OK. Let's continue.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.157
- Topless. Sure.
- Mm.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.092
Here we go. Football!

34:24.094 --> 34:27.196
Yes! Sure.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.665
And, wow! The doctor fetish.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.667
- In a lab coat.
- Mm-hm.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.402
- OK, how about Grindr?
- Mm.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.105
OK, Grindr.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.312
OK, I think it's enough.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.679
Thought it might be
too much for you.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.148
This is nothing for me.

34:46.150 --> 34:46.551
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

34:50.321 --> 34:52.788
But, you know,
it's not that bad, Grindr.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.356
If it wasn't for Grindr,
I wouldn't

34:54.358 --> 34:56.125
be able to have sex -
simple as.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.394
- That sucks.
- Why does it suck?

34:58.396 --> 35:00.362
Because... you don't meet people
in a different way? That's...

35:00.364 --> 35:02.698
- It's not...
- ..bad.

35:02.700 --> 35:03.732
It's not the how -
it's the what.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.168
OK.

35:06.170 --> 35:09.305
You know, with Tinder, you can
be more classy and gentle.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.273
Wow!

35:11.275 --> 35:13.175
On average, it takes me five
glasses of wine

35:13.177 --> 35:14.543
and I can get drunk and sleep
with someone,

35:14.545 --> 35:16.812
whereas with Grindr, it's...

35:16.814 --> 35:17.849
It's kind of the same
but with less chat.

35:24.355 --> 35:25.256
You know, honestly,
I scare myself sometimes.

35:27.692 --> 35:31.160
I-I go to work and I sleep with
a random guy

35:31.162 --> 35:32.296
and it satisfies me for, like,
5, 10, 15 minutes

35:32.830 --> 35:34.563
and then I just...

35:34.565 --> 35:35.333
come and I feel...

35:37.335 --> 35:40.402
..disgusting.

35:40.404 --> 35:41.606
It's like I just wanna
chop my dick off, you know?

35:50.314 --> 35:53.749
OK, so, I have an idea.

35:53.751 --> 35:56.152
- Let's play a game.
- OK.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.454
The game's about guessing

35:58.456 --> 36:00.589
what profession the people
we see have.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.258
- How exciting.
- OK.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.528
Yeah? I'll start. Um...

36:05.830 --> 36:08.430
This guy over there.
What's his profession?

36:08.432 --> 36:10.666
- What's his profession?
- Yeah.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.668
I think he works in
genetic mutations.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.671
What is that?

36:15.673 --> 36:16.641
When you, like,
modify the DNA of, like...

36:19.410 --> 36:21.610
- ..stuff.
- OK.

36:21.612 --> 36:22.813
Genetically modified tomatoes.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.682
What about...

36:26.684 --> 36:27.218
those three over there?

36:29.287 --> 36:31.554
Oh! They're like a family,

36:31.556 --> 36:32.788
like the royal family
of Berlin.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.791
- OK.
- But...

36:35.793 --> 36:38.327
they had a huge fight,
you know?

36:38.329 --> 36:39.562
Like, they're actually
not liking each other.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.397
Oh.

36:41.399 --> 36:43.334
And the man
slept with the sister.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.968
Oh, wow!

36:45.970 --> 36:48.437
What about those two there?

36:48.439 --> 36:50.239
- Oh, wow.
- Mm.

36:50.241 --> 36:51.874
- The kiss is kind of intense.
- Yeah.

36:51.876 --> 36:52.376
Bit much, isn't it?

36:55.613 --> 36:57.580
Wait a minute.
Is he fingering her?

36:57.582 --> 36:59.481
There might be a cheeky
finger going in there.

36:59.483 --> 37:01.283
- It's kind of gross.
- No, it's...

37:01.285 --> 37:03.552
- It's kind of good.
- No.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.321
Come on, it's cos they just
only met each other

37:05.323 --> 37:06.956
and they're in love.
In a few months,

37:06.958 --> 37:07.925
they'll have forgotten
each other completely.

37:10.494 --> 37:11.827
Yeah. And then they end up like
this couple over there.

37:11.829 --> 37:13.662
Oh, my God!

37:13.664 --> 37:15.264
Barely looking at each other
and talking.

37:15.266 --> 37:17.633
- That's so sad.
- No! It's cool.

37:17.635 --> 37:18.968
If I end up like that, like,
kill me. Like, no, thanks.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.403
No, that's actually...

37:21.405 --> 37:23.239
- Why? It's a victory of love.
- Oh, God.

37:23.241 --> 37:23.774
Probably they're not in the...

37:26.577 --> 37:29.278
..start of, I don't know, their
relationship or something.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.647
But still, it's like another
fire burning, you know?

37:31.649 --> 37:32.982
The silence is sexy.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.817
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:34.819 --> 37:36.752
I would rather be
them than them.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.921
That just looks so boring.
They look just sad.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.457
I'd rather be like those two
than those two. It's just...

37:41.459 --> 37:43.692
Well, OK. Well, I find it
beautiful, though.

37:43.694 --> 37:46.962
You know, my parents are
like that and it's...

37:46.964 --> 37:48.464
You don't have to speak
about everything

37:48.466 --> 37:50.299
all the time, you know?

37:50.301 --> 37:52.768
It's only about love for them

37:52.770 --> 37:55.471
and, therefore,
this is beautiful.

37:55.473 --> 37:56.839
If you say so.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.007
- OK.
- How about you?

37:58.009 --> 38:00.042
Mm.

38:00.044 --> 38:01.443
What do you do?

38:01.445 --> 38:02.645
What do I do?

38:02.647 --> 38:04.013
- Yeah.
- I dance.

38:04.015 --> 38:04.949
- Really?
- Yes.

38:06.984 --> 38:09.051
And I deliver food by bike, OK?

38:09.053 --> 38:11.287
That's so cool.
That you dance, I mean.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.721
- That's really cool.
- Thank you.

38:12.723 --> 38:14.358
- Good for you.
- Erm... You know, I'm...

38:15.726 --> 38:17.660
My sister was going to dance
class when we were younger...

38:17.662 --> 38:20.462
- Mm-hm.
- And this is, like,

38:20.464 --> 38:23.565
a memory that is, like, burned
into my head like yesterday.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.934
And I remember my mother took
me one day, with her,

38:25.936 --> 38:29.938
and when I entered
that dancing classroom,

38:29.940 --> 38:31.840
there was, like,
this old lady teaching.

38:31.842 --> 38:33.809
And she looked like she...

38:33.811 --> 38:36.879
I don't know, older than my
grandma, sort of thing.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.516
But she could move.
And when she started dancing...

38:41.752 --> 38:43.552
I don't know -
it was just like...

38:43.554 --> 38:44.953
Wow!

38:44.955 --> 38:49.091
She could move in ways

38:49.093 --> 38:51.560
that were so pure and
so beautiful, you know?

38:51.562 --> 38:55.331
Since then,
I'm obsessed with it.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.066
Like... Oh,
that's the thing I want to do.

38:57.068 --> 38:57.868
Mm.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.370
And what kind of dance
do you do?

39:01.372 --> 39:02.340
Er... Whoa!

39:05.009 --> 39:06.975
Look at the prosecco.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.011
Er, I do contemporary.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.813
And a bit of physical theatre,
though.

39:10.815 --> 39:13.082
I'm totally into Pina Bausch.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.352
You know her? She's amazing.
And DV8.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.119
Never heard of it. I don't know
why I asked. Sorry.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.521
Ah, you have to watch them.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.090
They have, like, a lot of
videos on the internet,

39:21.092 --> 39:22.791
and they are so amazing.

39:22.793 --> 39:23.627
What they express
with their bodies...

39:26.364 --> 39:27.963
- Unbelievable.
- I kind of wanna see.

39:27.965 --> 39:29.565
- What?
- You dance.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.533
- No.
- Yeah. Go on.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.634
- No.
- Why not?

39:32.636 --> 39:33.604
No way. I'm... No.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.875
Because I'm high and...

39:39.877 --> 39:41.011
And, I don't know, I'm, like...

39:48.753 --> 39:49.153
Well, because of you.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.992
I hate to say it but I don't
think we're gonna get

39:56.994 --> 39:59.094
another chance for this,
so I think... you should

39:59.096 --> 40:00.164
actually just stand up
and dance right now.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.968
Come on. Like, I might never,
ever see you.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.070
- I don't do those things.
- Come on, you have to dance.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.572
- No, I'm not dancing.
- Please. Just do it for...

40:10.574 --> 40:12.674
Live life. Like, "I should
have danced that day."

40:12.676 --> 40:14.977
- Leave me alone!
- Come on. Just do it.

40:14.979 --> 40:16.044
I know you want to.
You can tell you want to.

40:16.046 --> 40:16.647
Show me what you can do.

40:22.620 --> 40:23.986
OK.

40:23.988 --> 40:24.755
OK, correct answer.

40:30.861 --> 40:31.562
Yeah, that's really fit.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.735
I don't think so. I'm not...

40:39.737 --> 40:40.538
No, I don't... That's...

42:48.032 --> 42:49.965
Do you think this is joy?

42:49.967 --> 42:51.633
What?

42:51.635 --> 42:52.102
This feeling.

42:54.772 --> 42:55.873
Pure joy, baby.

42:58.108 --> 43:00.075
You're probably still high.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.243
No. I think I'm coming down,
actually,

43:01.245 --> 43:03.011
so I don't think it's...

43:03.013 --> 43:04.746
I don't think it's that.

43:04.748 --> 43:07.916
I'm thinking about this
a lot lately, you know?

43:07.918 --> 43:11.887
Like, the difference
between joy, pure joy,

43:11.889 --> 43:14.122
and the one you get from drugs.

43:14.124 --> 43:16.058
Like, they feel so similar

43:16.060 --> 43:20.095
but there must be some sort of
difference.

43:20.097 --> 43:23.599
You know, can we experience joy
by popping a pill?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.634
All right, Socrates. Well...

43:25.636 --> 43:26.902
yeah, why not?

43:26.904 --> 43:29.171
No, no, no. I-I...

43:29.173 --> 43:31.807
don't think it should come
that easy, you know?

43:31.809 --> 43:33.911
Things like that
are reserved for love.

43:37.915 --> 43:40.048
OK. Erm...

43:40.050 --> 43:41.850
I fall in love
as often as I get high.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.152
Really?

43:44.154 --> 43:46.755
Yeah, the bus driver, the cute
guy who serves me coffee,

43:46.757 --> 43:48.357
the old lady on my street
who only wears reds.

43:48.359 --> 43:49.291
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

43:49.293 --> 43:52.327
OK. Why?

43:52.329 --> 43:54.296
Like, society tells us who
we can fall in love with

43:54.298 --> 43:56.131
and how we should fall in love
with them,

43:56.133 --> 43:58.133
but we can fall in love
with anyone.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.768
Like, why can't we just fall
in love with anyone?

43:59.770 --> 44:01.203
- That's...
- Be shit.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.005
Yeah, and it kind of works.
It be shit.

44:03.007 --> 44:04.673
- It works, it works.
- No, no, this is not the love

44:04.675 --> 44:06.408
I'm talking about, you know?

44:06.410 --> 44:08.410
This is... This is love your
neighbours,

44:08.412 --> 44:10.779
love your community,
love humanity, OK?

44:10.781 --> 44:12.781
This is general love.

44:12.783 --> 44:15.751
I'm talking about love
between two persons.

44:15.753 --> 44:18.086
Like, it gets possessive,
it gets hard.

44:18.088 --> 44:19.988
It's fucking painful.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.757
You know? You...

44:21.759 --> 44:23.725
You get inspired by a person

44:23.727 --> 44:25.293
so much that he moves,
you do things,

44:25.295 --> 44:28.196
that you... That you...

44:28.198 --> 44:29.931
You can't get this person
out of your mind.

44:29.933 --> 44:32.267
He's, like, stuck in here
and...

44:32.269 --> 44:35.437
in your dreams
and you connect that

44:35.439 --> 44:39.741
to everything in your complete
life, and you end up, also,

44:39.743 --> 44:42.811
thinking of the possibility
that this could last forever.

44:42.813 --> 44:44.312
You know what I mean?

44:44.314 --> 44:47.349
Honestly? I've never
experienced that.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.085
Really? You were never in love?

44:50.854 --> 44:52.890
No. Not by your definition,
anyway.

45:04.101 --> 45:06.101
I mean, when I was younger,
I thought

45:06.103 --> 45:08.804
I was in love with people
but from afar, but, like...

45:08.806 --> 45:10.939
I guess when I was in year two,
I kissed my best friend.

45:10.941 --> 45:12.274
But usually, I just go on
Grindr

45:12.276 --> 45:13.475
and I fuck guys
and that's my life.

45:13.477 --> 45:15.477
I work, work, work, eat, fuck,

45:15.479 --> 45:17.212
work, work, work.
Eat, fuck, work, work, work,

45:17.214 --> 45:19.247
- and that's fine with me.
- Yeah, well...

45:19.249 --> 45:20.716
- It works for me.
- ..this is, like, the norm

45:20.718 --> 45:23.351
in gay community, you know?

45:23.353 --> 45:26.855
To be sexually free,
to have this instable libido,

45:26.857 --> 45:28.323
but this is not my drive.

45:28.325 --> 45:31.159
You know? I like...

45:31.161 --> 45:33.862
It's not that I'm not
enjoying sex, you know?

45:33.864 --> 45:36.898
But I want to fuck the person
I love

45:36.900 --> 45:39.101
and I trust, and this brings it
to another level, you know?

45:39.103 --> 45:42.070
Then you are...

45:42.072 --> 45:43.739
You're noticing all
the things in between.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.173
It's not only about coming -

45:45.175 --> 45:48.176
it's about worshipping
each other,

45:48.178 --> 45:51.747
being valued
and to not be alone.

45:51.749 --> 45:54.116
No, that's fine and that's good
for you but that's probably cos

45:54.118 --> 45:56.084
you grew up in a household
with love,

45:56.086 --> 45:57.786
and whose family got along
and parents loved each other.

45:57.788 --> 45:59.488
We don't have all that.

45:59.490 --> 46:01.323
I don't think it's about
only the parents.

46:01.325 --> 46:02.991
I think it's also
tied up to masculinity,

46:02.993 --> 46:05.260
the gay community, you know?

46:05.262 --> 46:09.965
That we are... We prove to each
other our virility and...

46:09.967 --> 46:12.367
Then, I don't know,
we just want to prove

46:12.369 --> 46:14.238
that we are as much a man
as a straight man.

46:15.105 --> 46:17.372
And there I get confused.

46:17.374 --> 46:21.076
I don't think it's an
expectation - I just... need it.

46:21.078 --> 46:22.444
- Need what?
- Like, fucking for me...

46:22.446 --> 46:24.146
- Well, fucking.
- OK. Oh, wow.

46:24.148 --> 46:26.181
It's a release for me.
I just...

46:26.183 --> 46:27.849
You know, I've never been in
a relationship

46:27.851 --> 46:30.418
or anything like that, but I...

46:30.420 --> 46:32.087
I just can't fuck the same guy
more than once, you know?

46:32.089 --> 46:34.456
And it...

46:34.458 --> 46:36.992
It gets to the point where I
have to fuck different guys

46:36.994 --> 46:39.027
at different times,
as many times as possible.

46:39.029 --> 46:40.562
I think it's also about
rejecting the hetero norms.

46:40.564 --> 46:42.330
- Mm.
- Like, that's it.

46:42.332 --> 46:44.166
I just can't fuck
the guy same...

46:44.168 --> 46:45.102
- The same guy more than once.
- Yeah.

46:52.876 --> 46:55.944
OK, here we are, but I have to
ask you to put your shoes off.

46:55.946 --> 46:58.079
Of course I can
take my shoes off.

46:58.081 --> 47:00.248
And the socks if you want
but it's not necessary.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.150
I'll leave my socks on
if that's OK.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.019
Yeah, leave them on,
you amateur.

47:04.021 --> 47:06.054
Wow! Wow!

47:06.056 --> 47:08.223
Wow!

47:08.225 --> 47:11.526
It has its own dance studio.
Check out the floor -

47:11.528 --> 47:13.562
- isn't it amazing?
- Is that...?

47:13.564 --> 47:14.563
The ash wood - it wouldn't
be... It would be better.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.565
OK.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.400
Erm, I think it's time for...

47:18.402 --> 47:19.369
- What?
- You.

47:22.506 --> 47:24.039
- Do what?
- I think you should...

47:24.041 --> 47:26.174
I think you should dance
for me.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.843
I told you before -
I'm not going to do it.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.578
- No? Come on. Please.
- No.

47:29.580 --> 47:32.848
- No.
- Pretty, pretty please.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.449
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Why not?

47:34.451 --> 47:37.485
I didn't ask you to operate me
or something, you know?

47:37.487 --> 47:39.087
You don't need an operation.

47:39.089 --> 47:42.090
No. I'm not going to do it.

47:42.092 --> 47:44.259
If you need an operation,
I will operate on you happily.

47:44.261 --> 47:45.460
Not on your free time.

47:45.462 --> 47:47.264
OK. OK, OK.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.365
Well...

47:50.500 --> 47:51.967
I'm just going to ask
one more time -

47:51.969 --> 47:53.635
will you dance for me,
please?

47:53.637 --> 47:54.471
I would really, really like it
if you dance for me.

47:56.506 --> 47:58.073
No.

47:58.075 --> 47:58.642
Fine.

48:01.411 --> 48:02.012
I'll dance for you, then.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.548
Are you sure you want
to do that?

48:06.550 --> 48:08.917
Yeah. Yeah, I will. I'm gonna
use those Hula Hoops over there

48:08.919 --> 48:10.151
and I'm gonna dance for you,
if that's OK.

48:10.153 --> 48:11.419
Feel free.

48:14.057 --> 48:15.123
Oh, God, no!

48:15.125 --> 48:17.895
Ah! Ah!

48:27.371 --> 48:28.470
Oh.

48:28.472 --> 48:29.905
Next.

48:32.075 --> 48:34.109
Oh, there we go.
We're getting it, getting it.

48:34.111 --> 48:35.510
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

48:35.512 --> 48:37.581
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

48:40.450 --> 48:42.284
- Oh, be careful!
- Oh!

48:42.286 --> 48:44.252
OK. That was... a surprise.

48:45.289 --> 48:46.256
Sh, sh, sh.

48:56.133 --> 48:56.700
Hmm.

49:08.412 --> 49:10.712
Oh, wow! You know, I find
this architecture fascinating.

49:10.714 --> 49:12.247
I think it's crazy how
something so ugly

49:12.249 --> 49:14.582
can be just so romantic.
It's...

49:14.584 --> 49:19.554
I think it's a little more than
romantic. It's idealistic.

49:19.556 --> 49:21.358
It is somehow melancholic
in its own way, and utopic.

49:36.506 --> 49:38.273
You know, seeing all these
trains makes me realise

49:38.275 --> 49:39.574
that I have to go back to work.

49:39.576 --> 49:41.676
Fuck!

49:41.678 --> 49:43.278
Why do you hate your work
so much?

49:43.280 --> 49:45.380
I'm fed up, Johannes.

49:45.382 --> 49:47.215
You get to do what you love
and that's great,

49:47.217 --> 49:49.284
but maybe you don't
make enough money,

49:49.286 --> 49:51.119
or you won't be able to afford
your own house until you're 50

49:51.121 --> 49:52.255
at least, or if... ever.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.358
Thank you for that.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.160
It's not about that. The most
important things in life is...

49:59.162 --> 50:01.029
to be able to do whatever you
want or to...

50:01.031 --> 50:03.031
To be with who you want
to be. Like...

50:03.033 --> 50:05.433
Like this now.

50:05.435 --> 50:08.336
So, why, then,
don't you do whatever you want?

50:08.338 --> 50:10.238
I don't know what
I want to fucking do.

50:10.240 --> 50:12.407
I don't know what I want
to do tomorrow. Like,

50:12.409 --> 50:14.676
you won't believe the amount of
times I said that I will

50:14.678 --> 50:17.212
go into work and quit my job
and blah, blah, blah. Like,

50:17.214 --> 50:19.647
in January I said that I would
become a person who helps

50:19.649 --> 50:22.017
inmates get back into society.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.019
And then I decided
I'd make cheese.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.254
Cos who doesn't love cheese?
I could make Cheddar cheese,

50:26.256 --> 50:28.523
Halloumi cheese. All kinds
of cheese. And then...

50:28.525 --> 50:31.259
I said to myself I would become
a cleft-palate surgeon and help

50:31.261 --> 50:32.560
children who are born with
cleft palates get rid of them.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.163
- And then...
- Wow!

50:35.165 --> 50:37.465
Bloody hell! Germany!

50:37.467 --> 50:39.567
And then I said to myself
I would

50:39.569 --> 50:41.669
become a tree surgeon,
you know?

50:41.671 --> 50:44.072
Because I watched a documentary
about tree surgery

50:44.074 --> 50:46.141
and those people are great
and they help trees

50:46.143 --> 50:48.243
and it's just so exciting.
And then, do you know what?

50:48.245 --> 50:50.578
All these people who can't get
abortions in the world

50:50.580 --> 50:53.048
who want to have abortions.
I thought I'd become, like,

50:53.050 --> 50:54.516
someone who can stand up for
them and help them and then...

50:54.518 --> 50:56.818
Wh-What's so funny?

50:56.820 --> 51:00.588
I'm sorry - it's just...
you sound so neurotic.

51:00.590 --> 51:03.658
Come on - with cheese
and trees...

51:03.660 --> 51:06.494
I just... Ever since I
learned about the world,

51:06.496 --> 51:08.630
I've wanted to change the
world, but what do I do?

51:08.632 --> 51:11.232
I just come to Berlin for
three days to get high on 2CB.

51:11.234 --> 51:15.737
2C-what? I mean, feeling guilty
will not help you or the world.

51:15.739 --> 51:17.541
2CB is just like M
but a bit more trippy.

51:20.744 --> 51:22.612
How did you do it? How did you
find your passion and be happy?

51:24.815 --> 51:28.216
To be honest, I'm not...

51:28.218 --> 51:29.553
Not really completely happy
with what I'm doing.

51:33.723 --> 51:36.491
I think nobody is, but, yeah,
I think... Yeah, I don't know,

51:36.493 --> 51:38.726
we all search for
the state of happiness

51:38.728 --> 51:41.129
but we can actually not
find it. It's probably unreal.

51:41.131 --> 51:42.564
But you know what
the problem is?

51:42.566 --> 51:44.632
It's actually...

51:44.634 --> 51:47.435
Maybe you will never find
what makes you happy.

51:47.437 --> 51:49.671
Or maybe you will
never find someone

51:49.673 --> 51:51.840
who will tell you what
happiness is.

51:51.842 --> 51:53.508
But I think this is OK.
You know?

51:53.510 --> 51:56.544
What I'm trying is...

51:56.546 --> 51:58.313
I know what I have
to do tomorrow

51:58.315 --> 51:59.716
and I try to enjoy that
as much as possible.

52:02.152 --> 52:03.553
My God, you are literally
so inspiring.

52:06.456 --> 52:10.191
Like, I'd love to be able
to walk into work tomorrow

52:10.193 --> 52:12.293
and just say "bye" to everyone.

52:12.295 --> 52:16.264
Just be like,
"I'm going. I'm gone."

52:16.266 --> 52:18.833
But, like, do it in, like,
a big massive, like, musical,

52:18.835 --> 52:20.902
kind of Bollywood-fashion way,
you know, with all the songs

52:20.904 --> 52:23.705
- and dances and, like, "Ah!"
- Yeah.

52:23.707 --> 52:26.608
That would be absolutely great.

52:26.610 --> 52:29.579
I can picture that 100%,
to be honest.

52:33.850 --> 52:34.618
You know, and...

52:36.620 --> 52:38.486
And then what?

52:38.488 --> 52:38.855
What do you mean?

52:40.757 --> 52:40.924
Like...

52:45.328 --> 52:45.795
Look at you and me.

52:48.298 --> 52:49.733
Harry... I have a boyfriend.

52:52.736 --> 52:53.503
Oh.

53:01.578 --> 53:02.345
Hm.

53:08.418 --> 53:09.417
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

53:09.419 --> 53:11.219
- No.
- Come on.

53:11.221 --> 53:13.588
What is...? No.

53:13.590 --> 53:15.757
- Come on. We're taking a photo.
- No, please!

53:15.759 --> 53:17.258
I've decided we're doing this,
so we're doing this.

53:17.260 --> 53:17.794
Just get in.

53:22.232 --> 53:23.500
- How much is it? Two euros?
- For real?

53:28.705 --> 53:30.240
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

53:31.841 --> 53:32.576
I've got...

53:53.363 --> 53:56.397
So, I have a boyfriend,
it's true.

53:56.399 --> 53:57.632
- That's all right.
- But you know what?

53:57.634 --> 53:59.634
This is true too.

53:59.636 --> 54:01.369
It's fine.

54:01.371 --> 54:01.938
OK.

54:05.375 --> 54:05.942
Does, erm...

54:08.445 --> 54:10.245
Does he know
that you're doing this?

54:10.247 --> 54:10.814
No.

54:13.783 --> 54:15.416
But we have an
open relationship, so...

54:15.418 --> 54:16.684
Oh, how's that going for you?

54:16.686 --> 54:18.586
Lots of chemsex
and threesomes?

54:18.588 --> 54:20.588
Are you sure you are all right?

54:20.590 --> 54:22.557
Yes. I'm sure I'm all right.
Why wouldn't I be all right?

54:22.559 --> 54:24.692
Do I look fine to you?
Do I look upset to you?

54:24.694 --> 54:26.494
I'm completely fine.
I don't give a shit.

54:26.496 --> 54:28.830
I don't care if you are married

54:28.832 --> 54:30.698
and have one of those
little shitty dogs

54:30.700 --> 54:31.334
and like to take them
on walks in parks

54:32.335 --> 54:33.968
and play
happy fucking families.

54:33.970 --> 54:34.904
I don't... I don't care.
Why would I care?

54:41.311 --> 54:43.911
Why did you tell me this after
spending ten hours with me?

54:43.913 --> 54:44.347
Did you feel sorry for me

54:45.649 --> 54:47.482
because I said that I wanted
to chop my dick off

54:47.484 --> 54:49.951
- or something like that?
- No. No. It's not that.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.319
I... I just didn't find
the right moment. I'm sorry.

54:51.321 --> 54:51.921
Great.

54:54.391 --> 54:55.058
Fucking great.

54:59.929 --> 55:00.764
And how is he?

55:04.301 --> 55:05.502
- He's OK.
- He's OK.

55:07.637 --> 55:09.437
Isn't that great?

55:09.439 --> 55:11.372
Well, if that's love,
then I don't want

55:11.374 --> 55:13.875
anything to do with that,
thank you very much.

55:13.877 --> 55:16.944
Let's say the relationship is
more open to him than for me.

55:16.946 --> 55:18.913
What does that mean?

55:18.915 --> 55:21.482
That means he wanted
an open relationship.

55:21.484 --> 55:23.484
- Mm.
- As you were saying before,

55:23.486 --> 55:25.520
because he needs to fuck around
all the time.

55:25.522 --> 55:28.056
And...

55:28.058 --> 55:28.858
I'm cool with it
as long as he loves me.

55:31.361 --> 55:33.728
But I... I don't
need to fuck around.

55:33.730 --> 55:35.530
OK, so you're happy with him
being able to fuck

55:35.532 --> 55:38.366
anyone he wants to
and still loving you,

55:38.368 --> 55:40.368
while you don't get to fuck
anyone else and you love him?

55:40.370 --> 55:41.636
Why don't you just
fuck more people?

55:41.638 --> 55:43.705
Because I'm OK
fucking just him.

55:43.707 --> 55:45.807
Really? How about the other
way round?

55:45.809 --> 55:47.410
Are you happy with that? That
he gets to fuck random people?

55:50.880 --> 55:54.816
I accept his rules, OK?
I need to trust him.

55:54.818 --> 55:57.354
Oh, wow! You accept his rules,
you need to trust him?

55:58.788 --> 56:00.788
I'm not the best person about
knowing about relationships

56:00.790 --> 56:02.924
but I know trust doesn't
work like that.

56:02.926 --> 56:06.127
You trust because you just
trust, not because you need to.

56:06.129 --> 56:08.730
Like, way, way back in the day,
when we were

56:08.732 --> 56:10.798
living in caves, still,
everyone was polyamorous.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.867
Everyone just
fucked around with everyone

56:12.869 --> 56:13.368
and that was just
the way that it was.

56:13.370 --> 56:17.672
The only reason why it stopped
is because of STDs on the rise,

56:17.674 --> 56:20.041
killing people off. So, if you
look at it, back in the past,

56:20.043 --> 56:21.144
our basic function
was just to...

56:22.512 --> 56:24.379
To fuck everyone,
just like most animals.

56:24.381 --> 56:27.448
Yeah, and this is bullshit,
you know?

56:27.450 --> 56:30.518
OK, I agree with you that we
are polyamorous by nature.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.787
But it's not about health.

56:32.789 --> 56:35.056
We live in a monogamous world,
OK, because of religion.

56:35.058 --> 56:37.091
Religion claimed
the traditional family.

56:37.093 --> 56:38.726
- Religion?
- Yes, religion.

56:38.728 --> 56:40.595
OK, what about
Muslims and Mormons?

56:40.597 --> 56:42.096
Yeah, OK,
bullshit right again there.

56:42.098 --> 56:44.966
- OK, so...
- OK, one man fucks ten women.

56:44.968 --> 56:47.568
Tell me - did these women
choose polygamous conditions?

56:47.570 --> 56:49.604
And, anyway,
I understand our nature.

56:49.606 --> 56:51.773
But I cannot accept it.
You know why?

56:51.775 --> 56:53.908
Because I was raised in
a fucking traditional family.

56:53.910 --> 56:56.010
- Mm.
- Yeah, where happiness

56:56.012 --> 56:58.946
means two people together.
So simple as that.

56:58.948 --> 57:01.816
And then I have all my friends,
you know? Sexually free.

57:01.818 --> 57:04.986
Having free sex,
all of that shit.

57:04.988 --> 57:08.956
And there am I, here,
feeling different.

57:08.958 --> 57:10.658
- And then I have Klaus, OK?
- Klaus?

57:10.660 --> 57:11.161
- Klaus is my boyfriend.
- Oh, great.

57:12.162 --> 57:13.661
And he wants
an open relationship,

57:13.663 --> 57:15.930
so why not have it?

57:15.932 --> 57:17.434
You know, I'm gay,
so I should, right?

57:20.103 --> 57:22.069
Because it's super-cool to have
an open relationship, it's...

57:22.071 --> 57:24.539
Everybody has it.

57:24.541 --> 57:27.575
So if I'm not doing this,
I am the fucking weirdo.

57:27.577 --> 57:29.811
And this is... And then...
I don't know.

57:29.813 --> 57:31.813
I don't know why
I'm lying to myself.

57:31.815 --> 57:33.714
If you don't want to do it,
then just don't do it.

57:33.716 --> 57:35.516
Yeah, why don't you just cut
off your dick

57:35.518 --> 57:36.186
with a knife, then?
It's so easy, right?

57:47.530 --> 57:49.165
Call me stupid
but I didn't expect this.

57:50.667 --> 57:53.668
I'm sorry - I just started to
believe it, you know?

57:53.670 --> 57:55.670
Fucking fool.

57:55.672 --> 57:56.139
So did I.

57:59.175 --> 58:00.076
I have an idea.

58:46.523 --> 58:47.190
Hmm.

58:49.559 --> 58:52.226
So... what do you want
from life?

58:52.228 --> 58:53.096
Ooh.

58:55.632 --> 58:57.598
That's a deep question.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.801
Really... goes far down.

59:00.803 --> 59:01.671
Can still jump, you know.

59:06.175 --> 59:07.176
I don't know. I guess...

59:09.746 --> 59:11.879
I guess I want to be
able to see my family

59:11.881 --> 59:13.917
and know that it's not the last
time I'm gonna see them.

59:19.255 --> 59:23.024
I wanna be able to sit with
the worst posture in the world

59:23.026 --> 59:25.261
and... not have to worry
about my back in 30 years.

59:29.766 --> 59:32.567
I guess I also wanna
be able to, like,

59:32.569 --> 59:34.070
spend money without worrying
about running out.

59:36.706 --> 59:39.006
To always be in the plus and
not have to worry

59:39.008 --> 59:40.675
about rent or
anything like that.

59:41.911 --> 59:44.178
Fuck! What's that?

59:44.180 --> 59:46.747
Calm down.
It's just... my alarm clock.

59:46.749 --> 59:48.583
Fuck, it's...
Why is it so fucking loud?

59:50.219 --> 59:52.587
What is this?!

59:52.589 --> 59:54.322
What's wrong with this? It's
so I don't miss my flights.

59:54.324 --> 59:56.891
Yeah, I mean,
we have phones nowadays.

59:56.893 --> 59:59.327
Yeah, I have a tendency to lose
my phone, so I bought this.

59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.062
It's big, it's ugly
and I never lose it.

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.230
- Bibi Blocksberg?
- What's wrong with that?

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.032
- You fucking kidding me?
- Nothing wrong with that.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.367
You know,
if I would be a thief,

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.669
I would return it straightaway.

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:09.937
That's the point of it, you
know? It's meant to be...

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:10.938
like that.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.708
Oh!

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:27.724
That'll be me soon, I guess.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:09.899
So, um...

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:14.303
This is it?

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:20.141
Time's up.

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.309
Well, I have to be at the
airport in three hours, so...

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.146
Hmm.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:34.891
Do you want to see
my apartment?

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:39.462
Really?

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.331
I don't know. It's...

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.134
OK.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.738
Hmm.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.406
Usually, I would say "yes"

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.008
and it wouldn't even be
a question, but with...

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.311
I don't... You know?

01:01:58.481 --> 01:01:59.248
Mm-hm.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.487
I can show you my kitchen.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:07.423
Photos and...

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:10.159
Give you a massage.

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:12.729
Massage.

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:29.846
- You OK?
- Yes.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.316
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:07:54.875 --> 01:08:00.917
This is the S9 train
to Schönefeld airport.
