Okay, Alfred G., three, two...

00:17.453 --> 00:18.852
Not today, my friend.

00:19.555 --> 00:21.811
Was he, like, a mobster or something?

00:21.836 --> 00:25.131
No, he, like, sells Vicodin
on the low, full time.

00:25.156 --> 00:28.453
Stop. Down. Now.

00:29.219 --> 00:30.383
If you tell me he has a goatee,

00:30.385 --> 00:31.570
I'm gonna be so jealous.

00:31.773 --> 00:33.483
He was really tender.

00:35.664 --> 00:39.178

good choice, Xavier L.

We do not make gestures like that.

Hunger Action Month.

01:15.535 --> 01:17.268
Then shouldn't they be eating it?

01:17.270 --> 01:18.436
No. I took it away from them,

01:55.395 --> 01:58.174
I just got off the phone
with Mrs. Lark from district.

01:58.176 --> 02:00.811
A while back, they
mandated that every school

02:00.813 --> 02:02.713
launch an anti-bullying program.

02:02.715 --> 02:05.316
I need this committee
to come up with ways

02:05.318 --> 02:07.284
to prevent bullying here at Fillmore.

02:07.286 --> 02:09.333
But we don't have a bullying problem.

02:09.335 --> 02:12.690
I know, but someone reported
that we didn't have a program,

02:12.692 --> 02:14.492
and now we have to have one.

02:14.494 --> 02:16.726
That was me.
- Why would you do that?

02:16.728 --> 02:18.796
But then how are we going to
know who the popular kids are?

02:18.798 --> 02:20.531

- I thought I was excused

02:20.533 --> 02:22.466
from all extracurricular activities

02:22.468 --> 02:23.868
due to emotional stress.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.065

when Lauren Zellnek

02:29.509 --> 02:30.808
convinced everyone that I was gay

02:30.810 --> 02:33.477
and put fetal pigs in my locker,

02:33.479 --> 02:35.565
I could have used a program like this.

Anyway, I need you all to
come up with different ways

02:41.220 --> 02:43.118

02:43.120 --> 02:44.955
Are you all in?
- Yes.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.262
Because with cutbacks
looming, it's volunteering

02:51.264 --> 02:52.630
for a program like
this that would keep you

to you guys about bullies.

03:07.547 --> 03:09.346
Did you know that the word "bully"

03:09.348 --> 03:10.830
originally meant "sweetheart"?

03:12.244 --> 03:13.684
Makes a lot of sense
when you think about it.

03:13.686 --> 03:17.938
Because sometimes a bully
starts out as a sweetheart.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.619
That's how they get you.

03:20.393 --> 03:23.527
A bully is someone who generally
disregards your feelings,

03:23.529 --> 03:24.528
ignores your texts,

03:24.530 --> 03:26.463
and changes the password on
your joint Netflix account

03:26.465 --> 03:28.766
two days after you break up.
- Uh, Ms. Watson...

03:28.768 --> 03:31.468
A bully can also take you
to Nashville one weekend

03:32.772 --> 03:33.737

03:33.739 --> 03:35.973
and then on Monday tell you it's over.

03:35.975 --> 03:37.310
What's a mimosa?

03:37.312 --> 03:39.513
It's something women in their 20s order

03:54.971 --> 03:57.625
And just because you leave
a shoe in his apartment

03:57.627 --> 04:00.431
doesn't mean you can
show up whenever you want.

what they did wrong on signs

them around their necks

only said nice things?

experiences like that?

09:33.860 --> 09:35.443
No? Really?

09:35.445 --> 09:38.888
No one's ever sprayed you
in the face with Windex?

09:39.466 --> 09:40.840
No one's ever started a
rumor that you were gay

09:40.865 --> 09:43.956
<i>because you won tickets to
The Rosie O'Donnell Show?</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:47.350
Did Lauren Zellnek make you
take a shot from a diva cup?

09:47.351 --> 09:49.423
Jesus Christ.

09:49.487 --> 09:52.994
Look, I really want to know
how brutal it is for you guys.

09:52.996 --> 09:54.970
People make fun of my haircut.

09:55.024 --> 09:57.796
Oh, if that's the worst
thing that's happened to you,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.852
you're dead when you
get into the real world.

09:59.877 --> 10:01.540
It's not that bad here at Fillmore.

10:01.565 --> 10:05.350
Ugh. You guys, you're giving
me nothing to work with.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.625
It's gonna get bad.

10:07.650 --> 10:11.046
When you get to sixth
grade, get boobs, cramps,

10:11.048 --> 10:13.582
whatever it is guys get,

10:13.584 --> 10:14.918
everything's gonna change.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.019
When that happens, remember
that you have a voice.

10:18.021 --> 10:20.055
And think of our group's name:

10:20.057 --> 10:23.443
Stop Teasing And Bullying. STAB.

10:23.445 --> 10:29.998
All: STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

10:30.000 --> 10:33.001
STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

10:33.655 --> 10:35.874
Ms. Snap, I drew you another picture.

10:37.007 --> 10:38.840
Why do you insist on making me ugly?

10:38.842 --> 10:41.002
What?
- I didn't pay $60 a week

10:41.004 --> 10:43.275
for a juice cleanse to have
my thigh gap go unnoticed.

10:43.855 --> 10:44.855
I'm on to you.

10:45.418 --> 10:47.355
I'm not gonna let you
bring me down, Debbie.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.523
This is a prime example
of institutional bullying.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.580
Gender specific bathrooms force students

11:00.582 --> 11:02.353
to prematurely classify themselves,

11:02.355 --> 11:04.020
when really gender's on a spectrum.

11:04.022 --> 11:07.123
I can relate. One time
I dreamt I had a dick.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.257
I do have one question though.

11:08.259 --> 11:10.242
How are they gonna know
which bathroom to use?

11:12.337 --> 11:13.648
Now they can use either.

11:14.203 --> 11:15.474
Don't you have a class right now?

11:15.476 --> 11:16.656
They're in silent free time.

11:16.658 --> 11:19.013
[all screaming]

11:19.015 --> 11:20.820
Come on. We've got five
more bathrooms to hit.

11:23.074 --> 11:25.926
Did you know you can
get HPV from fingers?

11:25.951 --> 11:28.077
How many fingers?

11:28.079 --> 11:30.676
I bought my very first Groupon today.

11:30.701 --> 11:32.683
Oh, nice. What was it for?

11:32.685 --> 11:34.545
Anal bleaching.

11:37.121 --> 11:38.896
Do you really think that you need that?

11:39.724 --> 11:40.715
Probably.

11:40.717 --> 11:42.058
Both: STAB! STAB! STAB!

11:42.060 --> 11:44.026
STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

11:44.028 --> 11:45.795
Oh, don't worry. That's, uh,

11:45.797 --> 11:47.163
that's our new anti-bullying club.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.165
Aren't they being a little aggressive?

11:49.167 --> 11:52.068
No. They're just standing
up for themselves.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.069
My mom says I can be President.

11:53.071 --> 11:55.250
You're too stupid to be the President.

11:55.252 --> 11:57.430
Oh, isn't that kid in your class?

11:57.432 --> 11:59.315
Yeah. That's Blake.

11:59.317 --> 12:00.500
Well, he's a bully.

12:00.525 --> 12:02.309
You need to call a
conference with his parents.

12:02.334 --> 12:03.342
Dumb bitch.

12:04.818 --> 12:06.021
Today.

12:06.865 --> 12:08.433
Because the bottom line is

12:08.435 --> 12:10.186
you can't break up with someone

12:10.188 --> 12:12.021
and still like all
their posts on Facebook.

12:12.497 --> 12:13.982
You need to give them closure.

12:14.521 --> 12:16.675
Just because one person's okay

12:16.677 --> 12:18.029
doesn't mean the other person is.

12:18.429 --> 12:19.921
For all you know, that other person

12:19.923 --> 12:21.585
could have been asked to
leave their pottery class

12:21.587 --> 12:23.833
at the learning annex
due to excessive crying

12:23.835 --> 12:26.829
<i>because the class kept reminding
them of the movie Ghost.</i>

12:27.906 --> 12:30.491
So what's the answer?

12:30.493 --> 12:32.868
Sorry. I got a little sidetracked.

12:36.782 --> 12:41.597
It's one.

12:41.599 --> 12:42.667
[knocking]

12:42.669 --> 12:44.238
Ms. Bennigan?
- Oh, Hot Dad.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.263
What?

12:46.685 --> 12:48.813
Yes? Hi. Hello.

12:48.815 --> 12:50.320
Are you Blake's dad?

12:50.322 --> 12:53.506
Yeah. You wanted to meet with me?

12:53.531 --> 12:56.766
Yes, thank you for coming in.

12:56.768 --> 13:00.525
Um, I wanted to talk
with you about some issues

13:00.527 --> 13:02.105
concerning Blake's behavior.

13:02.183 --> 13:03.316
Yeah.

13:03.998 --> 13:05.497
I was afraid of that ever since

13:05.530 --> 13:09.032
the, uh, change in our family situation.

13:09.347 --> 13:10.447
Oh.

13:10.449 --> 13:12.285
Oh, I'm surprised Blake didn't tell you.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.029
Uh...

13:15.219 --> 13:16.379
His mom left us.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.313
Oh.

13:19.226 --> 13:20.458
I'm so sorry.

13:20.483 --> 13:22.550
Oh, no. It's... it's fine.

13:22.575 --> 13:23.813
No, we'll be strong.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.516
We do miss having a
woman around the house,

13:26.547 --> 13:30.243
but, you know, you're sort
of a surrogate mom to Blake.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.469
[giggles]

13:37.742 --> 13:40.076
[chuckles]
- I'm... I'm sorry.

13:40.078 --> 13:41.906
I've embarrassed you.
- No, no, no.

13:43.899 --> 13:48.484
So, um, what's going on
with Blake's behavior?

13:48.486 --> 13:50.582
You know what? Don't worry about it.

13:50.903 --> 13:52.421
Hey, wait, what?

13:52.423 --> 13:53.356
I thought you said there were issues.

13:53.381 --> 13:54.890
The issue is he's too advanced.

13:54.892 --> 13:57.109
He's the smartest kid I've ever known.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.494
Blake?
- He's the pussy's pajamas.

14:00.398 --> 14:02.198
Cat's!

14:02.200 --> 14:05.382
The cat's pajamas.

14:06.270 --> 14:09.833
Okay. Well, thanks
for letting me come by.

14:09.835 --> 14:11.061
Thanks for letting me come.

14:13.378 --> 14:15.311
Well, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna get going.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.947
<i>Kids: STAB! STAB! STAB!</i>

14:17.949 --> 14:19.081
<i>STAB! STAB! STAB!</i>

14:19.083 --> 14:20.149
STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

14:20.151 --> 14:21.517
[blows whistle]
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

14:21.519 --> 14:22.284
Get out of here. Stop.

14:22.286 --> 14:23.867
STAB is too big for you to control.

14:23.892 --> 14:24.978
He's a bully.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.355
Let's show him what we do to bullies.

14:26.357 --> 14:30.292
Whoa!
- Kids: STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

14:34.184 --> 14:36.017
I am beside myself.

14:36.019 --> 14:38.386
This week was supposed
to prevent bullying,

14:38.388 --> 14:41.489
and now we have more
reported cases of bullying

14:41.491 --> 14:42.457
than ever before.

14:42.459 --> 14:44.059
Your compliments board turned into

14:44.061 --> 14:46.494
a-a... an insult board.

14:46.496 --> 14:48.463
We have a banned vigilante squad.

14:48.465 --> 14:50.498
<i>It's like Lord of The Flies out there.</i>

14:50.500 --> 14:53.535
We were trying...
- I don't care!

14:53.537 --> 14:56.972
Luckily, Mrs. Lark from the district

14:56.974 --> 14:58.506
is an anti-bullying expert.

14:58.508 --> 15:00.375
She's agreed to come in this afternoon

15:00.377 --> 15:03.501
and help these children
that you've traumatized.

15:05.087 --> 15:06.247
If today doesn't go well,

15:06.249 --> 15:09.602
start looking for other
places to warp young minds.

15:12.222 --> 15:15.090
If you see a kid who's
missing a tooth, let me know.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.115
I found this on the playground.

15:17.140 --> 15:18.613
Oh, shoot.

15:18.615 --> 15:20.395
Excuse me, I'm looking for the library.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.431
I'm here to facilitate
an anti-bulling workshop.

15:23.433 --> 15:24.032
Lauren?

15:24.034 --> 15:27.068
Oh, my God. Lauren Zellnek?
- [gasps]

15:27.070 --> 15:30.271
Oh, actually it's Lauren Lark now.

15:30.273 --> 15:31.106
I'm married.

15:31.108 --> 15:33.541
Um, sorry, do we know each other?

15:33.543 --> 15:34.409
You don't remember the girl

15:34.411 --> 15:37.521
you were completely
brutal to in high school?

15:38.857 --> 15:40.415
Deb Adler.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.551
Don't you mean Dumb Fatter?

15:43.553 --> 15:47.288
Oh, Deb, you have to let that go.

15:47.290 --> 15:48.423
It's in the past.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.524
Based on your eyeliner,

15:49.526 --> 15:51.292
I can tell you're still very angry.

15:51.294 --> 15:52.494
Seriously?
- Well, I'm sorry for the way

15:52.496 --> 15:57.499
I behaved in high school,
but that was a long time ago.

15:57.501 --> 16:00.235
And...[chuckles] bravo to you

16:00.237 --> 16:02.170
for losing all that weight.

16:02.172 --> 16:04.139
It must have been really hard

16:04.141 --> 16:09.210
because it was a lot of weight.

16:09.212 --> 16:14.082
A lot. [laughing]

16:14.084 --> 16:20.321
[laughing]

16:23.399 --> 16:25.752
Good afternoon.

16:25.754 --> 16:31.205
Today, we're gonna work
to turn all of you bullies

16:31.207 --> 16:32.721
into buddies.

16:32.723 --> 16:34.202
What a nightmare.

16:34.204 --> 16:38.373
Now, who here has a personal story

16:38.375 --> 16:39.476
they'd like to share

16:39.478 --> 16:43.511
<i>about a time they were bullied?</i>

16:46.035 --> 16:48.395
This is for the students.

16:50.824 --> 16:52.220
Yes.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.323
Ms. Snap hates my drawings.

16:55.325 --> 16:57.274
What? That's not true.

16:57.276 --> 17:00.195
They're just not an accurate
portrayal of my body.

17:00.197 --> 17:02.348
I drew you a new one.

17:04.401 --> 17:05.401
Ms. Snap?

17:09.925 --> 17:11.714
What a cool body.

17:13.376 --> 17:14.242
I love it.

17:14.243 --> 17:17.714
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:17.715 --> 17:19.446
All right.

17:19.449 --> 17:20.675
Where's Blake?

17:28.425 --> 17:30.358
Blake, why aren't you in the workshop?

17:30.772 --> 17:33.054
I can't go in there
and face all my nemeses.

17:33.483 --> 17:37.091
Listen, today you've gotta
walk in someone else's shoes.

17:37.093 --> 17:38.988
And now that you know what
it's like to be bullied,

17:38.990 --> 17:41.052
you won't do it again, right?

17:41.802 --> 17:42.802
Right.

17:44.085 --> 17:45.607
Do you feel better?

17:45.609 --> 17:47.345
Yeah. Thanks.

17:48.278 --> 17:51.412
Maybe you could tell your dad

17:51.414 --> 17:53.056
what a great talk we had?

17:55.579 --> 17:58.620
Don't you think it would
be fun to see me at school,

17:58.622 --> 18:00.844
and then back at your dad's house?

18:02.626 --> 18:05.593
For this next exercise,

18:05.595 --> 18:08.263
we're gonna do a little roleplay.

18:08.265 --> 18:10.986
Mrs. Adler, why don't you come up

18:10.988 --> 18:12.916
and help me show everyone

18:12.918 --> 18:15.770
the proper way to handle a bully?

18:15.772 --> 18:17.441
Let me guess. You're the bully.

18:17.443 --> 18:20.699
You're ugly.
- Have we started yet?

18:20.701 --> 18:24.074
I said you're ugly.

18:24.076 --> 18:27.182
Okay. I would appreciate it

18:27.184 --> 18:29.184
<i>if you would not talk to me like that.</i>

18:29.186 --> 18:31.085
At school, we should respect each other.

18:31.087 --> 18:34.445
You're a lesbian.
- No, I'm not.

18:35.640 --> 18:39.394
And calling someone a
lesbian isn't an insult.

18:39.396 --> 18:41.763
Even though you're not fat anymore,

18:41.765 --> 18:46.668
you'll always be a
fat girl on the inside,

18:46.670 --> 18:49.037
Dumb Fatter.

18:49.039 --> 18:51.206
Shut your mouth.
- Ah, ah, ah.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.807
Now that is the wrong...
- [yelling]

18:52.809 --> 18:55.743
Oh, my God.
- Who's a lesbian now?

18:55.745 --> 18:57.445
Kids: STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

18:57.447 --> 18:58.279
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:58.281 --> 19:00.348
Kids: STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB! STAB!

19:00.350 --> 19:02.416
Get off me, get off of me!

19:02.418 --> 19:05.238
Ladies, will you please
help me stop this?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.521
Stop it!

19:06.523 --> 19:09.157
Ow! She's biting me!

19:09.159 --> 19:12.660
[kids cheering]
- Ladies, help! Ow!

19:12.662 --> 19:14.964
I am the principal!

19:19.078 --> 19:23.045
Well, I just got off the
phone with the district office.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.297
We are so sorry.
- It was my bad.

19:25.299 --> 19:26.226
It is not my fault.

19:26.228 --> 19:29.953
Actually, it was good news.

19:29.955 --> 19:32.480
After what happened
today with Mrs. Lark,

19:32.482 --> 19:35.465
she doesn't want anything
else to do with us.

19:35.490 --> 19:37.790
She's excused Fillmore Elementary

19:37.792 --> 19:42.194
from any further participation
in the anti-bullying program.

19:42.196 --> 19:43.562
That's great news.
- That's awesome.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.097
Wow.
- So happy I could have helped.

19:45.099 --> 19:46.932
By the way, does anyone
know what's going on

19:46.934 --> 19:48.566
with the bathrooms?
