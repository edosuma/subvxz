00:02.746 --> 00:05.149
If you go to war,
you are destined for

00:05.216 --> 00:08.385
for great
and unfortunate things.

00:09.986 --> 00:12.154
<i>I would press north,</i>
<i>towards the Alps.</i>

00:12.222 --> 00:13.756
Let's see our people
to the winds.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.960
We could press
attack from the South.

00:17.028 --> 00:18.396
Pompey could stay Spartacus

00:18.463 --> 00:21.532
from gaining the mountains
and slipping from grasp.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.435
I will not be
as gentle next time.

00:23.503 --> 00:27.307
<i>She has moved</i>
<i>to join rebellion?</i>

00:27.374 --> 00:29.009
Five hundred of your men

00:29.077 --> 00:31.581
for Tiberius' life --

00:32.650 --> 00:35.285
<i>The boy holds no value now.</i>

00:35.353 --> 00:36.988
Crassus will yet honor trade.

00:37.055 --> 00:39.557
If you give him something
else his heart desires.

00:41.894 --> 00:44.396
Prepare the men for march.

00:44.464 --> 00:48.134
I would press towards Spartacus

00:48.202 --> 00:51.372
and see him to deserved end.

Spread word
to your kind to strike

01:41.497 --> 01:42.897
shackle from their slaves.

01:42.965 --> 01:47.036
Or see their houses follow
yours in blood and death.

01:47.103 --> 01:49.672
Who are you?

01:49.739 --> 01:53.209
I am Spartacus.

01:56.347 --> 01:59.049
Another villa set upon.

01:59.117 --> 02:00.284
What number holds total?

02:00.352 --> 02:02.820
Six in half as many days.

02:05.757 --> 02:09.560
I am Spartacus.

02:09.627 --> 02:12.564
I am Spartacus.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.600
I am Spartacus.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.308
I am Spartacus.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.578
He lays assault with swiftness

02:25.646 --> 02:27.146
to rival winged Mars.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.716
Spartacus stands
but mortal man.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.817
I have yet held
privilege of one that

02:30.885 --> 02:33.553
could span distant
ground within single breath.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.455
You believe reports false?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.524
I believe he lays strategy,

02:37.592 --> 02:40.193
to set Pompey to confusion.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.596
Chasing veiled spectre
of the man himself.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.697
We were charged with bringing

02:43.765 --> 02:45.799
Spartacus to heel, not Pompey.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.801
If the Thracian
slips beyond the mountain,

02:47.869 --> 02:51.071
burden of defeat shall
rest upon our shoulders.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.607
And those that have given
life towards campaign.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.516
There was nothing
save cooling embers

03:02.583 --> 03:06.119
<i>in the rebel camp where</i>
<i>Tiberius met his end.</i>

03:06.187 --> 03:08.121
Forward scouts are yet
to have set eyes

03:08.188 --> 03:09.589
upon Spartacus and his army.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.224
See efforts doubled.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.133
I would press the Thracian
upon field of battle

03:13.160 --> 03:15.228
at soonest opportunity.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.464
And gaze into his eyes
as life and hope

03:17.532 --> 03:19.332
forever drain from them.

03:30.012 --> 03:32.981
Lugo. See it done.

03:33.048 --> 03:34.849
Many times have
I marveled at mad

03:34.917 --> 03:37.285
scheme sprung
from fevered mind.

03:37.353 --> 03:40.188
Yet one you now set
forth towers above all.

03:40.256 --> 03:41.656
We have confounded
Pompey to the north,

03:41.724 --> 03:43.892
yet Crassus still advances
from the south

03:43.959 --> 03:45.693
with overwhelming advantage.

03:45.761 --> 03:48.663
Hope lies only in
deciding field of final battle.

03:48.731 --> 03:51.632
You weave barest tether
to the promise of such.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.834
It will hold long enough

03:53.902 --> 03:56.003
for the others
to slip from grasp.

03:56.071 --> 03:59.306
<i>I pray it so.</i>

03:59.374 --> 04:00.708
And would lend much needed aid

04:00.776 --> 04:03.277
in giving
Crassus fucking pause.

04:06.315 --> 04:09.317
Grip sword. And have it so.

04:22.698 --> 04:25.900
They have taken all from me.

04:25.968 --> 04:30.104
You will yet serve
purpose in coming battle.

04:30.172 --> 04:34.041
By seeing those who
cannot fight to the mountains.

04:34.109 --> 04:36.778
Return to task with Nasir,

04:36.845 --> 04:38.579
and prepare for journey.

04:42.751 --> 04:44.685
<i>The man is more</i>
<i>dead than living.</i>

04:44.753 --> 04:47.588
And yet eager to give
life to your cause.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.489
My cause?

04:49.557 --> 04:52.626
It does yet not stand your own?

04:52.693 --> 04:55.395
I'm no martyr upon cross.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.931
<i>That will gladly give my life,</i>

04:56.998 --> 04:59.100
so that those
more deserving may live.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.569
Then take pause,

05:01.637 --> 05:04.606
see heart attended
in advance of parting.

05:14.016 --> 05:16.151
<i>It seems another life.</i>

05:16.218 --> 05:18.920
That I last stood in equal
embrace with Crixus.

05:18.988 --> 05:21.489
<i>Much has been taken from us.</i>

05:21.557 --> 05:24.926
<i>Soon we will face</i>
<i>the legions of Rome.</i>

05:27.063 --> 05:30.298
And we will
return bitter favor.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.501
You crafted this?

05:33.569 --> 05:35.570
We will lash hand to grip.

05:35.638 --> 05:36.938
So it is not torn from grasp

05:37.006 --> 05:39.174
if called to split Roman flesh.

05:50.186 --> 05:54.022
I cannot flee to the mountains
with the others.

05:54.089 --> 05:57.826
Despite command, my place
is upon field of battle.

06:01.931 --> 06:05.767
As mine is forever
by your side.

07:03.262 --> 07:05.830
The hour is upon us.

07:05.898 --> 07:08.166
I do not want
to leave your arms.

07:08.234 --> 07:11.937
Nor I see you from them.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.272
Yet you must
go with the others.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.041
Come with me.

07:16.109 --> 07:18.244
You know I must stay.

07:18.311 --> 07:21.514
That you may
reach the mountains,

07:21.581 --> 07:26.351
live free
of the Republic beyond them.

07:26.419 --> 07:29.788
There is no life
absent your touch.

07:29.855 --> 07:31.890
You once said
to me that the gods

07:31.957 --> 07:34.960
had sent me to save you.

07:35.027 --> 07:38.997
And you were mistaken.

07:39.065 --> 07:42.534
You were the one sent.

07:42.602 --> 07:44.736
And I in need of saving.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.354
Your skills remain keen,
Imperator.

08:03.422 --> 08:05.657
I would sharpen
them to deadly edge,

08:05.725 --> 08:09.194
in advance of facing
the Bringer of Rain.

08:37.489 --> 08:40.057
<i>He appears at peace.</i>

08:40.125 --> 08:41.893
Does he not?

08:41.961 --> 08:43.662
Yes, Dominus.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.703
It is false image
of the boy I knew.

08:51.771 --> 08:54.239
Forever of furrowed brow

08:54.307 --> 08:56.475
and pressing concern.

08:56.543 --> 08:59.344
A reflection of his father,

08:59.412 --> 09:02.780
<i>grave of face and disposition.</i>

09:04.850 --> 09:07.785
He was not always so.
Was he?

09:07.852 --> 09:11.488
No, Dominus.
He was not always so.

09:11.556 --> 09:13.190
The passing of years
hardens a man

09:13.258 --> 09:17.094
to the simple joys of life.

09:17.162 --> 09:20.698
Until all that is left
is a thing of stone,

09:20.766 --> 09:23.701
cold and unforgiving.

09:23.769 --> 09:25.369
I wish nothing
more than journey

09:25.437 --> 09:28.239
had set towards different path.

09:31.175 --> 09:34.478
Give voice to slave
that robbed him of life.

09:38.916 --> 09:42.686
A man long in years.

09:47.859 --> 09:50.494
With scars of his
master etched upon flesh.

09:50.562 --> 09:53.797
Would that he had been struck
from this world,

09:54.999 --> 09:59.603
so that Tiberius
may yet be of it.

10:01.940 --> 10:03.374
Apologies for intrusion.

10:03.441 --> 10:04.975
We have received word
from forward scouts.

10:05.043 --> 10:06.009
Spartacus?

10:06.077 --> 10:07.678
A clutch of his men
sighted to the north.

10:07.745 --> 10:09.313
Give order to break encampment

10:09.380 --> 10:10.881
and fall to march.

10:10.949 --> 10:14.417
Imperator.

10:14.485 --> 10:16.019
War at last draws to its end.

10:16.087 --> 10:17.021
<i>As all things must,</i>

10:17.088 --> 10:19.723
born of man and misplaced
desire.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.124
The guards will see
you returned

10:21.192 --> 10:23.060
to where you belong.

10:23.128 --> 10:26.297
You have not asked yet
why I turned from you.

10:26.365 --> 10:29.734
Could answer reverse course
of time's passing?

10:29.802 --> 10:31.570
Or erase memory
of deepest wound?

10:31.637 --> 10:33.372
No.

10:33.439 --> 10:35.040
Yet I would give
life to gaze upon

10:35.108 --> 10:38.443
forgiveness in your eyes again.

10:38.511 --> 10:40.645
For all that I have done.

10:40.713 --> 10:43.047
If but I could be so moved.

10:51.089 --> 10:53.957
Once beyond camp,
you will divide number and path.

10:54.025 --> 10:55.392
Better give chance
of reaching mountains

10:55.460 --> 10:56.793
absent discovery by Pompey.

10:56.861 --> 10:58.528
I would count fortune
more assured,

10:58.596 --> 10:59.663
were you to lead us.

10:59.730 --> 11:02.131
Crassus must be given pause.

11:02.199 --> 11:05.168
So that you and the others
may slip beyond grasp.

11:05.236 --> 11:07.570
We will wait for you then,
at foot of the mountains.

11:07.638 --> 11:10.806
But I would not have it so.

11:10.874 --> 11:14.477
Am I not free,
to make own choice?

11:14.545 --> 11:18.214
As you frequently remind.

11:18.281 --> 11:20.549
Yet do not hazard life,

11:20.617 --> 11:24.020
in hopes that
I yet cling to my own.

11:24.087 --> 11:27.324
You will not fall
in battle against Crassus.

11:27.391 --> 11:28.792
You now hold power to pierce

11:28.859 --> 11:31.194
future's uncertain veil?

11:31.262 --> 11:34.064
I hold but faith.

11:34.131 --> 11:37.734
In a man like no other.

11:40.872 --> 11:45.709
Gratitude.
For your words.

11:45.776 --> 11:49.546
And for what comfort
your presence has given.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.684
Go.

12:00.058 --> 12:01.792
You are clear of purpose?

12:01.860 --> 12:03.761
Never more so.

12:03.828 --> 12:05.496
Yet Nasir and I shall
not be among those

12:05.563 --> 12:08.298
striking towards mountains.

12:08.366 --> 12:10.768
We have broken
words towards subject.

12:10.835 --> 12:12.036
You cannot fight --

12:12.103 --> 12:13.771
He has yet found way,

12:13.839 --> 12:15.039
forged by loving hands.

12:15.106 --> 12:18.109
Do not ask my own
to lay idle in coming battle.

12:24.817 --> 12:26.818
I have born witness
to the fall of many

12:26.886 --> 12:29.654
I have called brother.

12:29.722 --> 12:33.125
You are the last yet living

12:33.193 --> 12:35.027
that stood with me when
Batiatus' ludus

12:35.094 --> 12:37.630
was laid to ruin.

12:37.697 --> 12:39.665
You honor me,

12:39.733 --> 12:43.502
by standing again
at my side in final conflict.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.278
They are readied for journey.

12:59.753 --> 13:02.522
My friends.

13:02.590 --> 13:05.959
<i>The time of our</i>
<i>parting has come.</i>

13:06.027 --> 13:08.362
Know that you
will be heavy upon thought

13:08.429 --> 13:11.865
when we face Crassus
and his legions.

13:11.933 --> 13:14.401
Many of us will fall.

13:14.468 --> 13:17.437
<i>There remains strategy</i>
<i>nor deception</i>

13:17.505 --> 13:22.208
that can bend course
of inevitable fate.

13:22.276 --> 13:25.144
Yet know that our blood...

13:25.212 --> 13:26.712
<i>...shall purchase needed</i>
<i>opportunity</i>

13:26.780 --> 13:28.981
<i>for you to gain mountain paths.</i>

13:29.049 --> 13:31.917
Beyond snapping jaws of Rome

13:31.985 --> 13:34.686
that have plagued
us with death...

13:34.754 --> 13:38.190
<i>...and misery.</i>

13:38.258 --> 13:41.994
Part ways.

13:42.061 --> 13:46.365
And live free.

13:46.433 --> 13:50.302
Gratitude.
For all you've done.

13:55.875 --> 13:59.912
Gratitude.
Gratitude, Spartacus.

13:59.980 --> 14:01.847
<i>Gratitude.</i>
<i>Gratitude Spartacus.</i>

14:01.915 --> 14:03.282
<i>May the gods bless you.</i>

14:03.350 --> 14:05.251
<i>May the gods bless you.</i>

14:09.323 --> 14:12.425
<i>Gratitude...</i>

14:12.493 --> 14:16.263
Gratitude.

14:16.330 --> 14:19.733
Spartacus!

14:19.801 --> 14:20.967
Roman scouts have
laid eyes upon us

14:21.035 --> 14:22.135
to the south of the valley!

14:22.203 --> 14:23.836
What markings did they bear?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.838
Fearsome bull upon chest.

14:25.906 --> 14:26.873
Crassus.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.542
Fucking bait is seized upon.

14:29.610 --> 14:33.245
Set upon path,
and do not turn from it!

14:33.313 --> 14:35.181
Go!

14:37.550 --> 14:39.485
I shall lend prayer.

14:39.553 --> 14:41.487
Toward the end of Crassus.

14:41.555 --> 14:43.857
And the triumph of Spartacus.

14:58.206 --> 15:01.776
I have had my fill of words
and tearful farewells.

15:01.844 --> 15:03.277
<i>I desire blood,</i>

15:03.345 --> 15:07.447
and cries of our enemy.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.383
Let us make it so.

15:40.448 --> 15:41.715
<i>Halt!</i>

15:48.256 --> 15:50.824
<i>Balistae ready!</i>

15:57.365 --> 15:59.300
Do not engage
unless given command!

15:59.367 --> 16:01.902
Stand ready!

16:04.072 --> 16:07.174
Spear.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.451
I do not seek quarrel!

16:17.519 --> 16:20.054
Only to deliver message
from Imperator Crassus!

16:20.121 --> 16:21.522
Spear.

16:24.259 --> 16:26.127
Break words.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.864
And pray to your gods
I find them of worth.

16:49.017 --> 16:52.988
Have you ever witnessed
such a thing?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.122
So many hearts,

16:54.189 --> 16:56.290
beating towards inevitable end?

16:56.358 --> 16:58.125
Why did you call me here,
Crassus?

16:58.193 --> 17:00.127
<i>The same reason you came.</i>

17:03.599 --> 17:04.999
Curiosity.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.902
Well has it been satisfying?

17:07.970 --> 17:11.071
We've vexed each other
for many months.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.342
Both suffering grievous
wound upon effort.

17:14.410 --> 17:17.311
Yet have never
broken single word.

17:17.378 --> 17:18.880
There are none that
would hold difference.

17:18.946 --> 17:23.218
Perhaps.

17:23.285 --> 17:27.689
Yet I would still
have them regardless.

17:46.708 --> 17:49.376
Leave us.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.510
Imperator --

17:50.578 --> 17:52.379
Fall to command.

18:17.938 --> 18:19.539
It is a thing known, is it not?

18:19.606 --> 18:23.243
That you cannot
win this conflict.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.379
A sentiment shared.

18:25.447 --> 18:26.947
By all the Romans I have killed

18:27.015 --> 18:30.083
who held such belief.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.418
My son among them.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.221
Apologies Imperator I cannot
give voice to regret of passing.

18:34.289 --> 18:36.657
To the soldier
that robbed Crixus of life.

18:36.725 --> 18:39.092
The Gaul died
upon field of battle.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.794
An honor denied Tiberius.

18:40.862 --> 18:43.964
It is not as I had commanded.

18:44.032 --> 18:45.933
Yet the woman
had been rudely treated

18:46.001 --> 18:48.169
<i>by his hands,</i>

18:48.236 --> 18:50.404
<i>and her own claimed vengeance.</i>

18:54.209 --> 18:58.378
As mine are so moved
in memory of my son.

18:58.446 --> 19:00.080
And yours towards
wife no longer --

19:00.148 --> 19:01.615
Do not think to place your loss

19:01.683 --> 19:04.385
upon equal footing.

19:04.452 --> 19:07.455
Your son took
up arms for the Republic.

19:07.522 --> 19:11.458
The same one that saw
my innocent wife torn from grasp

19:11.526 --> 19:14.595
and condemned
to slavery and death.

19:14.663 --> 19:15.696
And now you
would lead thousands

19:15.764 --> 19:17.431
to join her in futile attempt.

19:17.499 --> 19:20.234
Whatever happens to my people

19:20.302 --> 19:23.071
it happens because
we choose for it.

19:23.138 --> 19:26.107
We decide our fates.
Not you.

19:26.175 --> 19:28.777
Not the Romans.

19:28.845 --> 19:31.280
Not even the gods.

19:31.348 --> 19:34.383
You choose but time
and place of journey's end.

19:34.451 --> 19:37.019
Better to fall by the sword

19:37.087 --> 19:38.587
than by the master's lash.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.857
And will
it balm festering wound?

19:41.925 --> 19:44.193
If the Bringer
of Rain heralds miracle

19:44.261 --> 19:47.596
and defeats Crassus
and his legions,

19:47.664 --> 19:49.999
will he withdraw
from the Republic?

19:50.066 --> 19:51.767
<i>Content that he's brought those</i>

19:51.834 --> 19:55.570
<i>who so injured him to justice?</i>

19:55.638 --> 20:00.141
There is no justice.

20:00.209 --> 20:02.910
Not in this world.

20:02.978 --> 20:05.679
At last.

20:05.747 --> 20:10.183
A thing we agree upon.

20:17.559 --> 20:22.229
When we again meet,
I will kill you.

20:22.297 --> 20:26.234
No. You are going to try.

20:31.073 --> 20:34.342
It is all a free man can do.

20:43.318 --> 20:45.786
You cannot place trust
in the words of Spartacus.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.021
What reason would he have

20:47.088 --> 20:48.589
to twist tongue upon subject?

20:48.656 --> 20:50.157
I do not pretend to know lay

20:50.225 --> 20:52.125
of a savage's fucking thoughts.

20:52.193 --> 20:53.727
Tell me again.

20:53.795 --> 20:57.564
What hand struck
Tiberius from this life?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.599
One belonging
to a man long in years,

20:59.667 --> 21:01.234
as I have said --

21:02.403 --> 21:06.306
Spartacus spoke of a woman.

21:06.374 --> 21:09.575
Moved by vengeance.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.711
<i>He but attempts to turn</i>
<i>us against each other</i>

21:11.779 --> 21:12.979
with plotted lie.

21:13.047 --> 21:15.415
The threat of ruin
carries upon such deceit,

21:15.483 --> 21:18.384
if so embraced.

21:18.452 --> 21:23.023
Yet only in
the breaking of truth

21:23.091 --> 21:26.493
swells hope of forgiveness.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.267
It was my hand that moved
against Tiberius,

21:34.335 --> 21:36.337
and saw him from this world.

21:44.847 --> 21:47.416
Was my touch so cruel?

21:47.483 --> 21:50.619
That you would strike
at heart through noble son?

21:50.687 --> 21:51.753
Speak!

21:51.821 --> 21:53.822
While you yet have
throat to give voice!

21:53.890 --> 21:56.859
<i>You place blame upon victim!</i>

21:56.927 --> 22:00.764
Your "noble" fucking son
forced himself inside her.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.534
One of many acts that
lead to deserved fate.

22:04.602 --> 22:05.535
More lies!

22:05.603 --> 22:08.138
It is the truth!

22:08.205 --> 22:09.439
His love for you turned to hate

22:09.507 --> 22:10.741
in the wake of the decimation.

22:10.808 --> 22:13.410
And he struck at you
the only way he could.

22:13.477 --> 22:16.546
One he knew would
inflict deepest wound.

22:22.787 --> 22:25.121
Why did you not tell me?

22:25.189 --> 22:29.759
I made attempt,
upon Melia Ridge.

22:29.827 --> 22:32.095
There is no misstep
that would see father

22:32.163 --> 22:35.065
withhold forgiveness
from treasured son.

22:43.407 --> 22:45.542
We did not wish
to cause you further pain

22:45.609 --> 22:48.178
absent reason, Marcus.

22:48.246 --> 22:50.180
<i>The cause of withholding truth.</i>

22:50.248 --> 22:52.249
Leave us.

23:07.198 --> 23:12.102
A son is but
reflection of the father.

23:13.204 --> 23:16.940
Is this how I stand?

23:17.008 --> 23:19.676
Twisted and grotesque?!

23:22.647 --> 23:25.115
You stand as you always have.

23:25.183 --> 23:28.118
A good man.
That does what he must.

23:34.192 --> 23:35.759
Apologies.

23:40.832 --> 23:42.533
Apologies.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.936
Apologies for
all you've suffered.

23:49.375 --> 23:52.778
Know that it shall
end when Spartacus falls.

23:52.845 --> 23:56.682
And unfortunate events of war

23:56.749 --> 23:59.785
trod path of distant memory.

24:33.352 --> 24:36.353
<i>It is heavy burden.</i>

24:36.421 --> 24:39.957
Gaze at war's end.
And weigh bitter cost of it.

24:44.195 --> 24:47.197
You do not believe
that we can defeat Crassus?

24:49.601 --> 24:53.303
You are forever
conjuring the impossible.

24:53.371 --> 24:55.806
And I would not wager
against you in final gambit.

24:55.874 --> 24:59.877
Yet odds are not of a favor.

24:59.945 --> 25:04.014
No. They are not.

25:04.082 --> 25:07.285
I would offer
drink to lift spirits,

25:07.352 --> 25:08.953
but I have
turned from it of late.

25:09.021 --> 25:12.557
A thing not escaping notice.

25:12.624 --> 25:14.792
I too turned
from wild pursuits.

25:14.860 --> 25:18.429
When possessed by purest heart.

25:18.497 --> 25:20.231
You speak of your wife?

25:23.936 --> 25:27.339
When we first lay together,

25:27.407 --> 25:30.976
she told of how the gods
delivered oracle in her dreams.

25:32.378 --> 25:36.414
And foretold that I would
never love another woman.

25:38.317 --> 25:41.086
Did prophecy hold true?

25:41.154 --> 25:43.989
I found comfort in others.

25:44.057 --> 25:47.693
Yet there's an emptiness
that can never be filled.

25:47.761 --> 25:52.065
A void left
where heart once beat,

25:53.834 --> 25:57.637
when Sura was taken from me.

25:57.704 --> 26:01.273
<i>You once questioned</i>
<i>how victory can be defined.</i>

26:01.341 --> 26:03.976
I thought answer
held in Roman deaths.

26:04.044 --> 26:07.346
A position no longer taken?

26:07.414 --> 26:10.616
Life is what defines it.

26:10.684 --> 26:12.017
Not the death of Romans.

26:12.085 --> 26:14.119
Nor ours, nor those
that follow us into battle.

26:14.187 --> 26:16.788
But the life of Sibyl.

26:16.856 --> 26:18.690
Of Laeta,
the mother and her child,

26:18.757 --> 26:22.460
so many others.

26:22.528 --> 26:25.163
They are all Sura.

26:25.230 --> 26:29.000
And I would see them live.

26:29.067 --> 26:31.535
A cause even I can embrace.

26:34.405 --> 26:37.274
If we are to give the others
any chance against Crassus,

26:37.342 --> 26:40.043
you must do more
than embrace it.

26:40.111 --> 26:42.145
You must lead.

26:42.213 --> 26:43.680
An old argument, Spartacus.

26:43.748 --> 26:46.282
One that must
now stand settled.

26:46.350 --> 26:49.719
I cannot do this without
you assuming rightful position.

26:52.189 --> 26:54.925
One that there
is none more deserving of.

27:00.198 --> 27:03.100
What would you have me do?

27:03.168 --> 27:05.636
The impossible.

27:20.652 --> 27:22.486
The men stand ready?

27:22.554 --> 27:25.189
They do, Imperator.

27:25.256 --> 27:27.791
Gratitude.

27:27.859 --> 27:30.427
For loyal service.

27:30.495 --> 27:32.195
<i>Spartacus stands the fool,</i>

27:32.263 --> 27:34.364
to face our
legions with so few.

27:36.567 --> 27:39.135
He has proven
himself many things.

27:39.203 --> 27:42.705
A fool not among them.

28:08.868 --> 28:10.369
They stand an ocean.

28:10.437 --> 28:13.773
As when Crixus was swept
from the shores of the living.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.608
They but offer opportunity.

28:15.676 --> 28:18.644
To swim in a sea
of Roman blood.

28:25.818 --> 28:28.153
Great and unfortunate things.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.994
What meaning do words carry?

28:35.062 --> 28:39.165
A warning,
given voice by loving wife.

28:41.368 --> 28:44.404
To a man who no longer exists.

28:52.946 --> 28:56.315
Soon Crassus will give command!

28:56.382 --> 28:59.818
And we shall face
his legions in open battle!

29:01.887 --> 29:06.057
We stand in the shadow
of greater might!

29:06.124 --> 29:10.694
As their Republic cast across
the lives of every man...

29:10.762 --> 29:13.230
<i>every woman...</i>
<i>And every child...</i>

29:13.298 --> 29:16.133
condemned to the darkness
of slavery!

29:19.403 --> 29:21.738
Forced to toil and suffer,

29:21.806 --> 29:25.008
so that those of coin
and position

29:25.076 --> 29:29.046
can see their fortunes grow
beyond need or purpose!

29:31.182 --> 29:32.983
Let us teach them,

29:33.050 --> 29:36.787
that all who draw
breath are of equal worth!

29:39.323 --> 29:41.725
And that those that seek
to place heel

29:41.792 --> 29:44.528
upon the throat of liberty...

29:44.595 --> 29:48.165
Will fall
to the cry of freedom!

29:59.810 --> 30:01.711
No wounded enemy
is to be blessed

30:01.779 --> 30:03.880
with merciful passing!

30:03.947 --> 30:06.850
I would make example
of all those who dare raise

30:06.918 --> 30:10.120
hand against the glory of Rome!

30:10.187 --> 30:12.055
Raise ballistae and catapults.

30:12.123 --> 30:14.224
<i>Go!</i>

30:14.292 --> 30:16.693
<i>Ignite!</i>

30:16.761 --> 30:17.895
<i>Ready!</i>
<i>Release!</i>

30:17.963 --> 30:19.797
<i>Release!</i>

30:23.469 --> 30:26.405
Forward!

30:34.381 --> 30:36.048
Sound advance!

30:36.116 --> 30:39.184
And see Rebellion
distant memory!

30:40.754 --> 30:41.887
Advance!

30:41.955 --> 30:44.790
<i>Advance!</i>

30:55.735 --> 30:56.835
Take position!

31:10.850 --> 31:12.151
Hold...

31:17.023 --> 31:18.691
Hold...

31:23.330 --> 31:24.697
Hold!

31:24.764 --> 31:27.499
<i>Charge!</i>

31:40.913 --> 31:44.215
Archers!

31:44.283 --> 31:46.517
Now!

31:50.922 --> 31:52.957
The savage yet proves
resourceful.

31:53.024 --> 31:56.226
He but delays coming
tide with grains of sand.

31:56.294 --> 31:58.228
Give signal to form testudo!

32:03.334 --> 32:05.001
They fall
to predicted maneuver.

32:05.069 --> 32:06.836
Let us show
them one unexpected.

32:06.904 --> 32:08.838
Now!

32:50.683 --> 32:53.685
Raise command for
ballistae and catapults!

32:53.753 --> 32:55.253
You would rain
death upon our own men?

32:55.321 --> 32:57.389
I would end this fucking war!

33:16.243 --> 33:17.943
Do not turn from advance!

33:18.011 --> 33:19.445
Press forward!

33:45.706 --> 33:47.674
The slaves fall to superior

33:47.742 --> 33:48.809
strategy and tactic.

33:48.876 --> 33:50.877
As do Romans beneath
our command.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.646
An unfortunate loss.

33:52.713 --> 33:56.450
Yet one gladly accepted,
to bring Spartacus to his end --

33:56.517 --> 33:59.052
<i>Riders approaching!</i>

33:59.120 --> 34:00.920
<i>About face!</i>

34:27.614 --> 34:31.217
Turn ballistae!
Quickly!

34:31.284 --> 34:33.386
You there!
Defend the left flank!

34:48.002 --> 34:49.870
Caesar!
Take command of rear position!

34:49.937 --> 34:52.804
<i>Do not let them</i>
<i>fall to confusion!</i>

34:52.873 --> 34:54.040
We must withdraw!

34:54.108 --> 34:56.309
No! That is what he expects!

34:56.377 --> 34:58.144
Sound horn and advance!

34:58.212 --> 34:59.746
Hi-ya!

35:13.161 --> 35:14.628
Castus!

35:25.940 --> 35:30.777
<i>Would that I had been you...</i>

35:30.845 --> 35:33.614
... for but a day.

35:46.930 --> 35:47.896
Agron!

35:47.964 --> 35:49.865
<i>Shore your flank!</i>

35:49.933 --> 35:51.901
Do not let them close upon us!

35:51.969 --> 35:54.337
Nasir!

35:59.377 --> 36:03.281
Naevia!
Aid Gannicus!

36:03.348 --> 36:04.282
Move!

36:04.350 --> 36:05.851
Come!

36:13.826 --> 36:16.695
Spartacus!

36:22.702 --> 36:24.002
Hi-ya!

36:41.321 --> 36:43.288
Imperator!

36:43.356 --> 36:44.956
Protect the Imperator!

36:47.093 --> 36:48.626
Crassus!

36:58.303 --> 36:59.570
It is a glorious day!

36:59.638 --> 37:01.072
To have so many Romans to kill!

37:01.139 --> 37:03.274
It is but one
life that holds meaning.

37:03.342 --> 37:04.775
Draw attention upon field.

37:04.843 --> 37:06.611
I shall claim it.

37:10.683 --> 37:12.083
<i>Hold the line!</i>

37:12.151 --> 37:15.687
Seize amphoras and see
them to purpose!

37:35.271 --> 37:36.839
Caesar!

37:42.478 --> 37:43.578
Send for the medicus!

37:43.646 --> 37:45.113
I need no soothing balm.

37:45.181 --> 37:46.381
Only to return to field

37:46.449 --> 37:48.082
with rebel blood hot upon face.

37:48.150 --> 37:49.784
Do not place
yourself at further risk.

37:49.852 --> 37:50.819
If you fall,

37:50.886 --> 37:53.221
Spartacus would
gain advantage --

38:21.585 --> 38:23.653
I have longed to meet
you in true contest.

38:23.721 --> 38:25.154
As I have longed
to see your head

38:25.222 --> 38:27.657
parted from fucking neck.

39:18.676 --> 39:20.410
Saxa!

40:01.151 --> 40:03.185
I made promise.

40:06.556 --> 40:08.190
That time next we met...

40:08.258 --> 40:11.293
I would have your life.

40:11.361 --> 40:13.095
Come then.

40:15.999 --> 40:18.067
And attempt to take it.

40:21.237 --> 40:23.305
Formation!

40:54.238 --> 40:56.739
<i>This does not belong to you,</i>
<i>slave.</i>

41:01.845 --> 41:03.112
No!

41:39.086 --> 41:41.988
Rotate!

42:14.622 --> 42:16.389
Hold!

44:37.391 --> 44:39.659
Halt!

45:01.949 --> 45:04.217
Would that you
had been born a Roman.

45:08.555 --> 45:10.790
And had stood beside me.

45:13.694 --> 45:17.197
I bless the fates...

45:17.264 --> 45:20.233
that it was not so.

46:45.353 --> 46:47.654
Agron!

46:50.825 --> 46:52.859
Give me a sword...

47:16.952 --> 47:18.487
Imperator --

47:18.554 --> 47:22.992
Fall by my side
and retake hill!

47:28.398 --> 47:29.632
Sweep surrounding hills!

47:29.700 --> 47:30.733
Imperator!

47:30.800 --> 47:33.368
The gods once more aid
Spartacus

47:33.436 --> 47:35.405
in slipping from fucking grasp.

47:35.473 --> 47:37.442
He weeps from
a thousand wounds.

47:37.510 --> 47:39.211
And if heart yet beats,

47:39.279 --> 47:41.146
it shall cease
at briefest passing --

47:41.214 --> 47:43.749
There are many who
have followed mad cause

47:43.817 --> 47:47.719
that still
cling to fading life.

47:47.787 --> 47:51.123
See them to promised
example upon Appian Way.

47:51.191 --> 47:52.892
And let all slaves,

47:52.960 --> 47:55.194
upon road
to Mother Rome know reward

47:55.262 --> 47:58.231
for turning hand
against master.

48:53.155 --> 48:55.590
Ignoble end.

48:55.658 --> 49:00.095
For a legend that once
stood a god of the arena.

49:00.162 --> 49:04.198
<i>Legends are but bone</i>
<i>and meat of dreams.</i>

49:04.266 --> 49:08.736
Rotting in the harsh
sun of reality.

49:08.804 --> 49:11.405
It is hard sight.

49:11.473 --> 49:14.207
To see one so loved
among the damned.

49:16.844 --> 49:20.914
She was known
to be of the rebellion.

49:20.982 --> 49:24.584
I have forgiven reason.

49:24.652 --> 49:27.219
Yet do what I must.

49:34.995 --> 49:36.662
Pompey.

49:39.824 --> 49:42.253
Praise the gods to find
you well old friend.

49:43.977 --> 49:46.815
I'd feared that Spartacus and his rebels
had overrun you,

49:46.935 --> 49:48.539
before I ratted them in the north.

49:49.342 --> 49:50.642
The north?

49:50.710 --> 49:52.411
He came upon
rebel army attempting

49:52.479 --> 49:54.180
to gain the mountains.

49:54.248 --> 49:57.083
Dispatch has already
been sent to Rome,

49:57.151 --> 49:58.852
naming Pompey victor

49:58.920 --> 50:00.821
<i>against enemy you</i>
<i>could not quell.</i>

50:00.888 --> 50:03.156
You claim false laurels.

50:03.224 --> 50:04.357
Spartacus
was defeated --

50:04.425 --> 50:08.595
-- in the north.
By valiant Pompey,

50:08.663 --> 50:10.563
<i>hero of Hispania.</i>

50:10.631 --> 50:12.098
You honor me.

50:12.166 --> 50:14.434
I but honor Rome.

50:14.501 --> 50:18.338
And those of like mind,
that would see it flourish.

50:19.740 --> 50:22.142
Then we are one in such regard.

50:22.209 --> 50:25.879
Let us break meal
on your return.

50:30.452 --> 50:32.920
After all that
we have suffered,

50:32.988 --> 50:35.022
you allow Pompey
to snatch triumph

50:35.090 --> 50:36.023
from deserving hands?

50:36.091 --> 50:39.093
Supporting claim
he will be made ally.

50:39.161 --> 50:42.429
<i>We shall stand fearsome</i>
<i>triumvirate,</i>

50:42.497 --> 50:44.398
with means to bend
the course of history.

50:44.466 --> 50:47.434
You forever
speak of the future.

50:47.502 --> 50:49.636
The past cannot be altered.

50:49.704 --> 50:53.840
The present holds
but regret and loss.

50:53.908 --> 50:55.068
It is only in the days to come

50:55.109 --> 50:59.213
<i>that a man may find solace.</i>

50:59.280 --> 51:01.715
When memory fades.

51:53.899 --> 51:58.136
<i>Gannicus! Gannicus!</i>
<i>Gannicus!...</i>

52:19.928 --> 52:22.329
He yet lives.

52:27.468 --> 52:29.402
We've gained the mountains.

52:32.172 --> 52:36.176
We waited for you, as promised.

52:39.380 --> 52:40.813
All safe?

52:43.584 --> 52:47.253
Pompey set upon other half.

52:47.321 --> 52:49.055
Many were lost.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.028
We must see him
to mountain path,

52:55.096 --> 52:57.497
before we too are discovered.

53:01.836 --> 53:04.404
Stay hand.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.909
I would rest awhile.

53:08.977 --> 53:11.045
We cannot stay here.

53:11.112 --> 53:15.650
No, you cannot.

53:15.717 --> 53:18.218
Nor can I follow.

53:26.528 --> 53:31.566
Spartacus... Spartacus.

53:37.807 --> 53:42.678
Spartacus.

53:42.746 --> 53:45.246
That is not my name.

53:48.952 --> 53:51.953
I shall finally hear it again.

53:54.090 --> 53:57.225
Given voice by loving wife...

53:57.292 --> 54:00.027
<i>in greeting longed for...</i>

54:10.372 --> 54:14.107
Do not shed tear.

54:14.175 --> 54:18.044
There is no greater victory...

54:18.112 --> 54:21.881
than to fall from this world...

54:21.949 --> 54:25.485
a free man.

55:41.798 --> 55:46.535
One day Rome
shall fade and crumble.

55:47.937 --> 55:53.008
<i>Yet you shall always</i>
<i>be remembered.</i>

55:54.410 --> 55:58.180
In the hearts of all
who yearn for freedom.
