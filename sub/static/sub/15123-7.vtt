WEBVTT

00:11.645 --> 00:13.514
( loud groaning )
11-3, us.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.884
That's not fair. Our team's like
120 years older than yours.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.320
It is fair because this is
Sabrina's first time playing.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.788
Sorry, did we forget
to explain to Sabrina

00:20.854 --> 00:23.457
the complicated rules
of living-room-balloon-ball?

00:23.524 --> 00:25.226
You hit the balloon
over the couch.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.095
Okay, we all up to speed now?

00:27.161 --> 00:29.797
Rotate.
(phone ringing)

00:29.863 --> 00:31.732
Hey, hey, hey.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.801
Hey, didn't know if I'd catch
you on a Saturday.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.204
Hi, Dad.
Is he there?

00:36.270 --> 00:38.172
You promised to yell for me
when he picked up.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.707
I did yell,
but you didn't hear me

00:39.773 --> 00:41.709
because you refuse
to wear the hearing aid.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.144
It makes me look old.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.412
You know what
makes you look old?

00:44.478 --> 00:46.214
Saying "What?"
What?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.915
Wear the aid or get off
the phone, Christine.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.251
Anyway, Burt,
your brother Bruce
can't have us

00:50.318 --> 00:51.519
for Thanksgiving this year.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.254
He'll be
on an Alaskan cruise.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.888
Did you tell him
about Alaska?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.457
Yes.
What?

00:56.524 --> 00:57.691
What can I do for you guys?

00:57.758 --> 00:59.427
The long and short of it
is this, Burtie--

00:59.493 --> 01:00.961
Since Bruce
will be gone,

01:01.028 --> 01:02.763
we thought we'd
spend the holiday
at your place.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.399
Obviously it
won't be as fancy
as Bruce's,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.701
but it'll be more like
the original Thanksgiving--

01:07.768 --> 01:10.271
no heat, and I'm sure
some of the food
will be donated.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.106
I'm kidding, son.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.642
But look, it's
been way too many
years since we saw you.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.144
What do you say?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.546
( panting )
My parents want to come
here for Thanksgiving!

01:18.612 --> 01:19.880
And they'll see
that I haven't done anything

01:19.947 --> 01:22.216
with my life in the last
five years!
Burt, are you there?

01:22.283 --> 01:23.617
I bet he didn't pay
his phone bill.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.085
Burt, you're just
torturing yourself.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.754
We're not that close
with these people.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.922
They always judge you.
Just tell them
we made other plans.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.559
See you at Thanksgiving.
Can't wait. Love you.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.626
(screams)

01:32.693 --> 01:34.595
Oh, I was thinking
what you said,

01:34.662 --> 01:36.197
but then
these other words came out!

01:36.264 --> 01:37.898
Oh, stupid brain.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.300
( balloon pops )

01:40.701 --> 01:42.503
* Whoo! *

01:42.570 --> 01:46.840
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:48.176 --> 01:49.310
Four days.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.845
Four days to make
this place presentable.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.748
We got to work like
the boss is watching.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.884
Oh, and Jimmy, you
got to get rid of
that baby for the holiday.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.387
What?
She won't care.
It's not Christmas.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.788
Having a baby
out of wedlock

02:00.854 --> 02:02.823
was one of the biggest things
they judged me for.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.057
I don't want
them judging me again

02:04.124 --> 02:05.393
for letting
you repeat the cycle.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.395
It's like a
self-refilling prophecy.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.529
Thank you.
So ditch the kid.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.664
In fact, you
can go with her.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.900
'Cause you remind them
of my mistake.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.835
Now I got to go evict
the porch squirrels.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.039
So I take it Burt's
relationship with his parents

02:19.106 --> 02:20.174
is kind of estranged?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.675
Oh, no, it's
completely strange.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.212
Two malaprops in a row.
God, I love this family.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.248
Yeah, they are malaprops,
but they're also his parents.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.116
And they really do
a number on him.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.584
It's because he knows

02:30.651 --> 02:32.253
that they've always thought
he was a screw-up.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.988
Here you go, Brucie,
a dollar for every "A."

02:35.055 --> 02:36.290
Keep getting grades
like that,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.226
I'm going to have
to get a second job.
( chuckles )

02:38.292 --> 02:40.261
Hey, I got two "A's"
on my report card.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.662
You know what else
has two "A's"?

02:41.729 --> 02:42.996
"Jackass."

02:43.063 --> 02:45.599
(laughing)

02:45.666 --> 02:48.336
We don't mean to laugh,
but your brother's very clever.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.538
"Jackass" does have
two "A's" in it.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.541
In the spelling--

02:53.607 --> 02:55.443
uh, there's two
"A's" in the...

02:55.509 --> 02:57.611
Uh, go play
with your trucks.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.281
I just got
into business school.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.716
Way to go, Bruce.
I knew it.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.585
I got Virginia pregnant.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.653
I knew it.
( sighs )

03:05.719 --> 03:08.155
Get that thing
off my counter.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.890
There's pee on it.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.960
Yeah, business is going great.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.629
Turns out it was a good thing
I had a kid early,

03:15.696 --> 03:17.365
'cause now I
have an assistant on the job.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.099
How is Jimmy?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.569
Great. Busy.
Choosing colleges.

03:21.635 --> 03:25.606
Somebody was supposed
to pick me up from the mall!

03:25.673 --> 03:28.276
I had to walk three miles
in humidity,

03:28.342 --> 03:30.511
you worthless sheep!

03:30.578 --> 03:32.780
He's, uh, he's going through
a little phase.

03:32.846 --> 03:36.284
Jimmy, you remember
your grandparents, don't you?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.286
Check out my new piercing.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.254
( sighs )

03:40.321 --> 03:41.221
(zipper unzipping)

03:41.289 --> 03:42.423
Oh...

03:43.724 --> 03:46.560
Bruce's son has one
with a real diamond.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.264
Yeah, no matter
how hard Dad tries,

03:50.331 --> 03:51.732
his parents always think

03:51.799 --> 03:53.734
Bruce's poo doesn't stink,
and-and Dad's does.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.870
Which is sort of true, because
Bruce eats a very bland diet.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.839
(squirrels chattering)

03:58.906 --> 04:00.774
(sighs)

04:00.841 --> 04:02.743
Poor baby.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.278
It still kills him that
he doesn't have their approval.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.713
( sighs )

04:05.779 --> 04:07.648
Ah...
(yelling)
( squirrel chattering )

04:07.715 --> 04:08.616
(screaming)

04:14.688 --> 04:16.056
So I know you're bummed
about your parents visiting,

04:16.123 --> 04:17.224
but I think I got an idea

04:17.291 --> 04:19.560
that'll make you
feel a lot better.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.596
This is a house I clean...
Are we going to have
unfamiliar bedroom sex?

04:22.663 --> 04:25.766
I knew that erotic
suggestion box would pay off.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.000
Thank you, Oprah.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.602
That's not it.
Come inside.

04:29.803 --> 04:33.006
Oh, are we going to have
unfamiliar kitchen sex?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.743
This could be our only chance
to have sex on an island.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.878
I noticed this when I was
cleaning here earlier today.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.950
They're going on vacation
during Thanksgiving.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.852
It's perfect, Burt.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.821
We can tell your parents
we've been working real hard,

04:47.888 --> 04:49.056
saving up our money.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.358
And we bought this house.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.493
It's perfect!
I know!

04:52.560 --> 04:54.362
You don't have to feel
like a loser anymore.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.529
I love you so much.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.531
You know what I want
to do right now?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.967
Have sex with me
on an island?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.602
Okay, but let's wipe it down
real good first.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.771
People cut raw chicken
on these things.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.250
That one.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.086
No, no, no, wait.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.555
He has sad eyes.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.391
Cook that one.
(squawking)

05:23.457 --> 05:26.360
Okay, okay, sorry,
sorry. Not you.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.628
I can't do this.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.497
It's best if you don't
look in their eyes.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.098
Just say Edgar or Morty.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.332
What's going on?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.034
Uh, Barney's going to pretend
to be my parents' caterer

05:34.101 --> 05:36.269
on Thanksgiving
to impress my grandparents.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.238
We're going
to go with this one.

05:38.305 --> 05:41.141
He's old, and I don't
think he'll make it
to next Thanksgiving.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.410
Plus, I want him
to die with dignity.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.779
And not just end up as turkey
burgers on the Fourth of July.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.015
Oh, hey, do you want
to hang out for Thanksgiving?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.517
Seriously?
Yeah.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.151
Wyatt's away interviewing
at law schools,

05:51.218 --> 05:53.621
and my family's taking
the jet to Turkey

05:53.687 --> 05:55.288
for what they're called
"an ironic Thanksgiving."

05:55.355 --> 05:56.990
So I'm alone, too.

05:57.057 --> 05:57.858
That would be great.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.160
Yeah, pretend to be
a little family.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.261
Well, if we're going to pretend,

06:01.328 --> 06:03.130
we could go to the fake house
with everybody else.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.898
My dad can't have a problem
with his parents meeting Hope

06:04.965 --> 06:05.966
if she has a mother.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.402
Oh, my God, it'll be like
turkey dinner theater.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.103
I just hope I can
pull it off.

06:10.170 --> 06:10.938
I'm not so great
at lying,

06:11.004 --> 06:12.840
and this is really
important to my dad.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.108
Okay. Well, maybe we should
practice kissing a couple times

06:15.175 --> 06:18.746
so it's not awkward
when we do it in front
of your grandparents.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.813
Okay.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.217
How was that?
I feel like we
looked uncomfortable.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.553
Let's try again.
Okay.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.254
(turkey gobbling)

06:27.320 --> 06:29.389
He's old, but he's got

06:29.457 --> 06:32.025
a lot more fight
left in him than I thought!

06:51.679 --> 06:53.814
We're home.

06:53.881 --> 06:58.452
* Our house
in the middle of our street *

06:58.519 --> 07:02.490
* Our house
in the middle of our *

07:02.556 --> 07:04.658
* Our house it has a crowd *

07:04.725 --> 07:07.795
* There's always something
happening *

07:07.861 --> 07:10.397
* And it's usually quite loud *

07:10.464 --> 07:13.901
* Our mum she's so house-proud *

07:13.967 --> 07:17.738
* Nothing every slows her down
and a mess is not allowed *

07:17.805 --> 07:19.973
* Our house... *
This is your new room, Maw Maw.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.509
* In the middle
of our street *

07:21.575 --> 07:24.044
* Our house... *
Nice.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.748
* In the middle of our... *
(buzzing)

07:27.815 --> 07:31.084
In my day, they were shaped
more like penises.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.285
(doorbell ringing)

07:32.352 --> 07:34.021
They're here.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.288
They're here!

07:35.355 --> 07:36.790
VIRGINIA: Welcome.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.792
Wow, wow, what a place.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.829
Burt, I don't believe this.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.796
Aw, crap.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.031
It was Virginia's idea...

07:44.097 --> 07:46.634
To, um, move
into this neighborhood.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.468
Because, uh, they have
better schools here.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.538
Grampy and Grandma!

07:50.604 --> 07:51.605
Jimmy!
( chuckles )

07:51.672 --> 07:54.575
No creepy makeup.
Thank God.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.943
JIMMY:
Got a surprise for you.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.078
You didn't put another earring
in your swizzle stick, did you?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.213
No, I've been using my
swizzle stick for other things.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.348
SABRINA:
Hi.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.050
Surprise.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.552
Uh, this is my wife,

08:04.618 --> 08:06.019
Sabrina.
Hi.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.855
And this is your
great-granddaughter Hope.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.491
Jimmy, I just got to ask--
in light of your parents'
track record,

08:11.559 --> 08:13.794
did the, uh, marriage
cause the baby

08:13.861 --> 08:16.997
or did the baby
cause the marriage?
( Burt laughs loudly )

08:17.064 --> 08:19.032
That's rich.
Just like me.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.333
Come on, I'll
give you the tour.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.737
I never get tired of looking
at all my cool stuff.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.906
Venison meatballs?

08:25.973 --> 08:28.275
Oh, uh, this is Barnard,
our caterer.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.677
He does all our big events--

08:29.743 --> 08:31.244
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

08:31.311 --> 08:32.412
WrestleMania.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.714
Enjoy.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.325
Argh...

08:45.392 --> 08:46.994
matey.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.495
She won't take a nap.
( sighs )

08:48.562 --> 08:50.297
I think it's 'cause
she's in a strange place.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.101
Her and I
are in a strange place

08:54.167 --> 08:55.402
emotionally, lately.
( Christine sighs )

08:55.468 --> 08:58.572
Sabrina was just telling me
about the day you met.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.507
That was very
courageous

09:00.574 --> 09:01.842
how you lost a testicle

09:01.909 --> 09:03.877
saving her
from an armed robber.

09:03.944 --> 09:07.047
Luckily he went after the
criminal doing a cartwheel.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.083
Or he'd have taken that bullet
right between the eyes.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.885
Um, that's right.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.387
And the truth is,
is that without the other
one there taking up space,

09:14.454 --> 09:17.424
the one that is left
has just gotten gigantic.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.391
They're like goldfish.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.460
The more space they have,
the bigger they get.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.362
I love giant goldfish.

09:22.429 --> 09:26.800
Why don't you take Great-Grandma
and-and show her your fishies.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.535
I want to see your fishies.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.905
Shot me in the
testicle?! Really?!

09:31.972 --> 09:34.041
I know. Isn't it hilarious?
It was Sabrina's idea.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.275
Mmm. By the way,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.544
I told her that we potty
trained Hope at six months.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.747
So if she starts to stink,
whoever's holding her

09:39.813 --> 09:41.749
is going to have to
apologize for farting.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.283
I just love
all this playacting.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.719
I haven't had this much fun
since I did improv games

09:45.786 --> 09:47.487
at the teen mom center.

09:47.554 --> 09:51.058
They thought it would help us
talk our way out of having sex
the next time.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.059
Ah.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.031
( sniffs )

10:01.468 --> 10:03.671
( beeping )
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Chat request.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.807
( grunts )

10:08.742 --> 10:10.477
"Hey, girl, whatcha doing?"

10:10.543 --> 10:12.045
Oh.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.082
"Reading what you just wrote."

10:15.148 --> 10:17.450
Dummy.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.353
"What are you wearing?"

10:20.420 --> 10:22.656
Oh.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.292
"Sweater set,

10:25.358 --> 10:28.195
"control top pantyhose,
( sniffles )

10:28.261 --> 10:30.731
and, uh, navy slacks."

10:31.732 --> 10:32.733
( sighs )

10:33.701 --> 10:35.535
"Weird.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.338
"You might
be more comfortable

10:38.405 --> 10:40.240
taking that off."

10:40.307 --> 10:42.342
Hmm.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.977
"Makes sense to me."
( sighs )

10:45.145 --> 10:47.781
Boy, this is beautiful,
beautiful.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.050
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I raided your humidor.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.452
You've got quite a few
illegal Cubans in there.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.021
Oh, yeah?

10:54.087 --> 10:56.189
Maybe we should,
uh, let them out.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.424
Well, I already did.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.059
(nervous chuckle)

10:59.126 --> 11:00.728
(laughing)

11:00.794 --> 11:02.462
You know, son,
I'm really impressed

11:02.529 --> 11:04.364
with all of this.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.532
I mean,
look at this.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.667
This is
40-year-old scotch.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.069
( spits )

11:09.136 --> 11:10.938
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning
to get rid of that.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.439
It's probably gone bad
by now.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.274
Yeah.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.844
( mutters )

11:16.910 --> 11:18.645
To you, son.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.748
To me.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.619
(coughs)

11:26.686 --> 11:27.755
Fire in the hole.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.026
(coughing)

11:35.395 --> 11:36.529
(grunting)

11:36.596 --> 11:38.198
This is great, ain't it?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.367
(coughing)

11:40.433 --> 11:42.469
"You make me crazy.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.504
"I want to see you right now.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.940
Let's video chat."

11:47.007 --> 11:50.043
Well, I could do that.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.080
(gasps)

11:59.186 --> 12:01.488
So if you like
your dinner,

12:01.554 --> 12:03.991
I purchased all
of the ingredients
at Howdy's Market.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.593
In the future, Barnard,
we prefer

12:06.659 --> 12:07.961
you shop at the high-end market

12:08.028 --> 12:09.529
because when you're rich,

12:09.596 --> 12:11.198
you don't concern
yourself with prices.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.065
Clap, clap.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.767
Mm-hmm.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.869
I, I found my diary!

12:15.936 --> 12:19.106
Apparently, me and-and some guy

12:19.172 --> 12:21.274
named, uh, Brayden
are in love

12:21.341 --> 12:24.011
and-and there's nothing
anybody can do about it.

12:24.077 --> 12:24.945
Hmm.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.849
(phone rings)

12:28.916 --> 12:31.718
Anybody gonna get that?

12:31.785 --> 12:34.254
Uh, they'll call back.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.924
(answering machine beeps)

12:36.990 --> 12:38.458
WOMAN: Hi, thanks for calling.
You've reached...

12:38.525 --> 12:42.529
Please leave a message,
* My country 'tis of thee *

12:42.595 --> 12:46.166
( answering machine
continues )
* Sweet land of liberty *

12:46.233 --> 12:50.570
( man's voice,
indistinct )
* Of thee I sing *

12:50.637 --> 12:54.174
* Land where my father died *

12:54.241 --> 12:57.845
( answering machine
continues )
* Land of the pilgrims' pride *

12:57.911 --> 13:02.749
* From every fountain side *
* From every mountainside *

13:02.816 --> 13:08.688
* Let threesomes ring. *
* Let freedom ring. *

13:08.755 --> 13:11.224
( answering machine beeps )
We do that every day at 7:00.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.494
14.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.931
RALPH:
I don't want
to talk about it.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.199
CHRISTINE: We have
to talk about it.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.634
I don't want to.
We have no other
option, Ralph.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.802
I can't take it
anymore.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.804
We have to tell Burt
the truth.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.406
Tell me the truth
about what?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.942
Is it that I'm adopted?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.278
'Cause every time I change
the radio stations in the car

13:31.344 --> 13:32.712
and the Mexican
music comes on,

13:32.779 --> 13:33.881
I just start dancing
in my seat.

13:33.947 --> 13:34.948
I can't control it.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.850
That's not it, Burt.
Christine?

13:36.917 --> 13:40.020
We're completely broke and we're
about to lose our house.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.421
( sighs )

13:41.488 --> 13:43.290
What happened, Dad?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.825
I had all my retirement money
tied up with Bernie Madoff

13:45.893 --> 13:48.695
and Borders bookstores,
and I lost it all.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.164
That's the real
reason we came here.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.566
They kicked us out of our house.
We're homeless.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.937
But now that I
see how well you're doing,

13:57.004 --> 13:58.771
what do you think
of us living with you

13:58.838 --> 14:00.407
until we get back
on our feet?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.909
( sighs )

14:03.843 --> 14:05.112
We'd be honored.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.186
(hushed): What the hell
are you thinking?

14:13.253 --> 14:15.655
They can't stay here
because we don't live here.

14:15.722 --> 14:16.689
( hushed ):
I know, I know,

14:16.756 --> 14:18.791
but do you have any
idea how great that felt?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.427
I'm their hero now.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.462
I've waited my
whole life for this.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.864
Talking like this
hurts my voice.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.533
Burt, the people
who own this house

14:26.599 --> 14:29.102
are gonna come back.
Not for three days.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.338
Please, Virginia, let me feel
like this for three more days,
( sighs )

14:31.404 --> 14:33.073
and then I'll tell them
the truth, I promise.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.342
It is kind of fun
pretending to be other people.

14:36.809 --> 14:37.677
Three more days can't hurt.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.012
Yeah.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.413
So, uh...

14:40.480 --> 14:43.416
what do you say to some
unfamiliar bed sex?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.053
All right. Ooh, I'm gonna go
find some earrings.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.356
I want to look like
one of those chicks
from Real Housewives.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.905
( snorts )

15:05.973 --> 15:07.507
(sighs)

15:08.741 --> 15:11.211
Aren't you our maid?

15:11.278 --> 15:13.947
Probably not anymore.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.748
You might want to check
your kitchen calendar.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.884
You're not supposed to be
home for three days.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.720
Someone just had
to try the moguls.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.555
But that's not the point.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.790
(girl screams)

15:23.856 --> 15:25.692
Oh, yeah,

15:25.758 --> 15:28.261
my grandmother's also sleeping
in your daughter's room.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.364
BOY: A woman?
Thank you, God!

15:31.431 --> 15:33.700
And apparently my son's
fake wife is sleeping

15:33.766 --> 15:35.402
in your son's bed.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.471
These are beautiful,
by the way.

15:41.774 --> 15:46.279
Boy, you guys sure high-tailed
it out of there fast.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.780
I should get those people
to come over here

15:47.847 --> 15:49.616
and kick you
out of this house.
( sighs )

15:49.682 --> 15:52.352
Well, since it doesn't
seem to matter anyway...

15:52.419 --> 15:55.655
I'm-I'm not actually
Jimmy's wife.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.190
I just thought it would
be fun pretending

15:57.257 --> 15:58.625
to be somebody
that I'm not.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.193
I'm Tiffany Hargrove.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.961
I'm, uh, the artistic director

16:02.029 --> 16:03.263
of the Natesville
Dinner Theater.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.531
And, um, well,
I gotta run,
( chuckles )

16:04.597 --> 16:06.133
'cause I'm running a little late

16:06.199 --> 16:07.767
for a dress rehearsal
for Fiddler on the Roof.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.102
( chuckles )
Toodles!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.771
So where's
your real wife?

16:11.838 --> 16:13.173
I'm a single father.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.008
Hope's real
mother got electrocuted.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.010
Oh, that's so sad.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.311
Faulty wiring?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.280
Yeah, in her head.
Murdered a bunch of folks.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.182
Got the electric chair.
( gasps )

16:22.249 --> 16:23.450
Also, two testicles.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.584
Two.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.656
I can't believe you lied to us
about having money.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.324
What about you?
You call and say you want

16:31.391 --> 16:32.692
to visit at Thanksgiving,

16:32.759 --> 16:34.527
but you kinda left out the
part about you being homeless.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.363
You're right.
You're right. I blew it.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.965
The only thing I
have left of any value is

16:39.032 --> 16:40.200
this antique
pocket watch.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.968
And that's only because
I just stole it

16:42.035 --> 16:43.536
from that house
we were just in.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.837
Give me that.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.606
I'll put it back Tuesday.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.442
When Bruce
comes back into town,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.678
I'll explain everything.
You can go stay with him.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.912
No, you can't do that.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.947
I don't want Bruce
to find out.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.616
Please, save me
this one bit of dignity

16:56.683 --> 16:59.319
until I figure out a way
to get back on my feet.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.820
Well, you can
stay here in the meantime.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.389
It's not as lavish
as the other place,

17:02.455 --> 17:03.723
but it's a roof over your head,

17:03.790 --> 17:05.158
and you're welcome to it
for as long as you need.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.693
Oh, goody.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.660
Now I get to split

17:07.727 --> 17:10.363
my social security
check seven ways.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.503
I don't know
what I'm happier about:

17:16.569 --> 17:18.771
that my parents are staying
with us or that

17:18.838 --> 17:20.940
we finally have an excuse to
order the gut-buster pizza.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.076
You're just really enjoying
playing the hero, aren't you?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.811
( chuckles )
Yeah, it's nice.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.013
At first, I was afraid
they didn't really
want to be here,

17:27.080 --> 17:30.150
but I think they're
starting to feel
a little more comfortable.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.519
Well, they certainly
look comfortable.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.421
What the hell is all this?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.955
Oh, it's our new bed.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.024
You didn't expect us
to sleep on

17:38.091 --> 17:39.259
that old couch,
did you?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.694
That thing had 70 years
of farts in it.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.631
Uh, what the hell are those
sunglasses you're wearing?

17:44.697 --> 17:47.367
We got ourselves
a new 3-D television.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.536
CHRISTINE: We're watching
the History Channel.
( Ralph laughs )

17:49.602 --> 17:51.804
It's like the Nazis
are marching right in here.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.540
How'd you pay
for all this stuff?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.875
Turns out there was one
credit card company

17:55.942 --> 17:57.844
we weren't maxed out on.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.811
Sushi?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.848
( sighs )
Mom, Dad,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.550
we got to talk.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.585
JIMMY: Dad explained
to Grandma and Grandpa that now

18:05.652 --> 18:08.221
that they were poor, they
needed to start acting like it.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.291
And lucky for them,
we were the perfect
people to teach them.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.692
First they needed jobs.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.594
And since Grandpa made all his
money in real estate,

18:14.661 --> 18:16.663
we found him something
selling houses.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.365
See ya at 5:00.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.766
( tires squealing )

18:19.832 --> 18:21.434
Instead of his normal
three-piece suit,

18:21.501 --> 18:22.902
he wore a chicken suit.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.972
But when you're poor,
you can't be too picky.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.275
Meanwhile, Mom taught Grandma
how to live within their means.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.210
So you just
add a little vinegar

18:30.277 --> 18:31.511
and some lemon juice.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.146
(chuckles)
Don't bother.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.683
I closed up shop
down there a long time ago.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.485
Down there?
I was just showing you how

18:38.551 --> 18:41.388
to make cheap salad dressing.
What were you talking about?

18:41.454 --> 18:42.555
Oh...

18:43.656 --> 18:45.225
Never mind.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.827
JIMMY: Mom also showed Grandma
how to shop using coupons

18:47.894 --> 18:50.430
and how to always keep an eye
out for damaged goods.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.266
And when there aren't any
damaged goods,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.167
she showed her how
to damage them.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.368
( sighs )

18:58.070 --> 19:00.940
We also showed them you could
relax after a hard day's work

19:01.007 --> 19:03.243
without going to one of those
fancy chairs at the mall

19:03.310 --> 19:04.611
that cost a dollar.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.815
And that you
don't need a fancy 3-D TV

19:08.881 --> 19:10.217
to entertain yourself.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.785
All you need is a couch,
a balloon,and a stupid game.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.487
Next.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.688
By the end of the week,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.624
they totally got
the hang of it.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.659
They say you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.194
But apparently you
can teach a grandpa

19:21.261 --> 19:23.596
in a chicken suit
to flip a sign.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.365
To the progress
of my parents and learning

19:25.432 --> 19:27.700
that you don't have
to be rich to be happy.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.402
And year-old freezer-burned
flank steak

19:29.469 --> 19:31.504
is just as good
as top sirloin.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.940
Better: you can
chew so much longer.

19:34.006 --> 19:34.807
(laughs)

19:34.874 --> 19:37.410
Enough. I can't
take this anymore.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.412
What, Dad?
Hold on.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.650
I've been gnawing on that same
bite for 15 minutes.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.452
I'm sorry, I just can't
do this anymore.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.787
Oh, thank God.
I can't, either.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.690
My fingers are covered
in coupon paper cuts

19:50.757 --> 19:54.026
and, well, this salad
dressing tastes like douche.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.762
We know you're trying
to help us,

19:55.828 --> 19:57.697
and we-we know that you
enjoy this life,

19:57.764 --> 19:59.766
but it's a God-awful
way to live.

19:59.832 --> 20:03.536
I mean, no offense.
You keep a lovely home.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.005
Your brother Bruce gets back
from his cruise tomorrow.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.508
And as humiliating
as it might be to tell him

20:08.575 --> 20:10.510
that we need his help,
it's nowhere near as bad

20:10.577 --> 20:11.911
as living on a budget.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.248
(whispers):
Take me with you.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.650
Bruce isn't coming in.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.286
Cut himself shaving
and is afraid

20:19.352 --> 20:20.687
if he touches something,

20:20.753 --> 20:21.854
he'll catch
the flesh-eating bacteria.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.257
Oh, my God,
I never thought of that.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.693
Let's go.
Love you, Burt.

20:29.629 --> 20:33.366
You know, son, I always
thought of you as a slacker

20:33.433 --> 20:35.702
who took the easy way out.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.537
But after living with you
for one week,

20:37.604 --> 20:40.607
I've realized that you're
not a slacker.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.643
I mean, you take care
of that old lady,
and your son,

20:43.710 --> 20:45.745
and, uh, your
illegitimate granddaughter

20:45.812 --> 20:48.448
by working your butt off
for very little money.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.450
That's to be commended.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.120
Thanks, Dad.

20:54.186 --> 20:58.691
I, however, would rather kill
myself than live like that.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.327
You're a better man than I.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.665
( car engine starts )

21:05.732 --> 21:07.367
Well, we've got
about five hours

21:07.434 --> 21:09.736
till they repossess
this TV.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.804
Let's see what a 72-inch,

21:11.871 --> 21:13.973
3-D Wheel of Fortune
looks like.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.547
(doorbell rings)

21:26.386 --> 21:27.954
Is Barbara June here?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.357
I just can't
get her out of my mind.

21:31.524 --> 21:35.294
Maw Maw, your
boyfriend's here!

21:35.362 --> 21:38.064
CHILD: Happy Thanksgiving.
Gobble gobble.
