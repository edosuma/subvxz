was a completely unknowing

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.113

for deeply personal reasons.

He had murdered someone
very close to me,

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.072
and in return,
my first instinct was basic.

never include Frank Kitchen.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.070
I changed my mind
about the man.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.592
He was an abandoned child who
had become a ward of the state,

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.992
condemned to live
on the streets at an early age.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.639

romantic nostalgia for the idea

have a second chance,

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.478

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.757
a scientist...
in a way, an artist.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.317
I decided I wouldn't
and couldn't do

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.516
something simply
for revenge,

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.278
so I also performed the surgery
partially as an experiment.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.837
I wanted to reinforce
the theory that,

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.513
if gender is identity,

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.998
then even the most extreme
surgical procedure

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.159
will fail to alter the essence,
and this proved to be true.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.838
Frank Kitchen is still
very much the man he was

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.118
because he believes himself
to be the man he was.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.920
So, you see, my experiment
was a success and a failure.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.596
My sincere hope
for his redemption was naive.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.472

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.710

of an overweening estimation

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.799
However, having said that,

I decided to put up a fight.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.115
If you could be
manipulated properly,

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.954
maybe I'd get out
of this miserable facility

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.634
and rightly end up
in front of a judge and jury.

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.040
I'd hire myself
some hotshot lawyers

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.750
and hope for 12 men
and women, good and true,

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.998
who would appreciate my vision
of a better world.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.114
I buy the plan.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.072
But you blew it in the hearing.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.356
After I lost my temper
and attacked you,

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.999
I knew it was game over.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:35.916
[Sighs]

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.877
A trial would be
one long misery

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.394
with a predictable end,

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.076
resulting in an even
greater humiliation.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.313
So I decided
to accept my fate,

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.352
but I wanted there to be
a statement of the truth.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.917
I wanted it to be on the record,

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.870
in case anyone ever cares
to look for the facts.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.236
Now I'll return to my books
and my private thoughts.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.916
Good-bye to out there
and all that.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.754
Good night, room.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.673
Good night, moon.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.157

about Johnnie.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.110
Although she screwed me over,
I really liked her.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.158
She stayed working in Reno.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.272
I think it was
the best thing for her.

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.155
A new city, new place to live,
a fresh start.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.795
Yeah, I think it worked out
for the best.
