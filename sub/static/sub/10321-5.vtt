You know the kind of guy
who does nothing
but bad things...

00:03.771 --> 00:06.574
and then wonders why
his life sucks?

00:06.607 --> 00:11.145
Well, that was me.
Every time somethin' good
happened to me,

00:11.179 --> 00:13.281
somethin' bad
was always waitin'
around the corner.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.220
That's when I realized
I had to change.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.424
So I made a list
of everything bad
I've ever done,

00:23.457 --> 00:26.394
and, one by one,
I'm gonna make up
for all my mistakes.

to be a better person.

to see me wearing
a fancy jacket...

and teachin' a class.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.342
All right.
Let's get started.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.545
But how hard can it be
to teach foreigners
to speak American?

So why am I here?
Number 27 on my list--

with accents.

[ Earl Narrating ]
I wasn't sure how to make up
for all the teasin' I had done,

01:53.581 --> 01:56.217
so I asked the one person
I know who also talks funny.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.487
I mean, speaks with an accent.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.224
You made fun of the way
people talk? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

I don't know how I'm gonna
make up for it.

You wanna make up
for laughing at people...

who can't speak your language,
teach them your language.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.367
I could do that.
Does the manager know...

02:13.401 --> 02:16.337
you wash off the plastic cups
and put 'em back in the rooms?

02:16.370 --> 02:19.407
It was his idea.
He told me not to waste my time
trying to be so clean...

The last time I stood in front
of a room full of foreigners,
I was robbing the D.M.V.

02:29.617 --> 02:33.454
All right, guys.
Let's try some basic directions.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.689
To get to the library,

02:35.723 --> 02:38.726
you need to take a left
at the light.

These people were not
gonna find the library.

to find the "liberry," and

- Here's the food.
- Thanks, Crab Man.

coming up with another phrase
for when I drop off the food.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.621
I have no opinion on that.
Yeah.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.492
It's tricky.

It feels good to hug a man
and know it doesn't have
to go anywhere.

How was prison?
Did they make you
go to sleep real early?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.271
Well, they turned
the lights off
around 9:00,

in the dark
