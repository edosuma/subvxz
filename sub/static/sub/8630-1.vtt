"And we were in the backseat of his Buick

17:12.656 --> 17:16.660
"And, girl, he started looking at me

17:16.743 --> 17:19.996
"Yeah, he started looking at me real strange

17:20.080 --> 17:23.625
"Like l was a woman or something

17:24.585 --> 17:30.090
"And he started talking real soft
ln the backseat of that old Buick

17:30.925 --> 17:34.678
"And by the time the sun was coming up

17:35.722 --> 17:39.891
"l just couldn't stop grinning

17:42.562 --> 17:45.188
"Girl, you gave it up in the back of a Buick?"

17:45.273 --> 17:48.024
You better be talking about a ride to school.

17:48.109 --> 17:51.695
-We are.
-Have you done your warm-ups?

17:51.779 --> 17:52.821
-Yes.
-Yes.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.866
Yes? So, everyone ready to begin?

17:57.535 --> 17:58.952
Positions, from one.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.541
And five, six, seven, eight.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.002
No. And again.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.130
Five, six, seven, eight.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.842
And Nyla... And spin.

18:14.844 --> 18:15.969
Nice.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.639
Keep going, ladies. Keep going. Sorry.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.484
Are you okay?

18:30.568 --> 18:35.447
Yeah, l'm just... l'm just a little nauseous.
l don't know what it is.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.533
l think you're just nervous about college
and being on your own.

18:38.618 --> 18:43.914
l've seen this before. Hey, you'll be fine.
You're a smart girl.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.500
Come on, l'll get you a ginger ale.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.337
Excuse me.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.805
-Coffee.
-Thanks.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.065
Unit's centered in the vicinity
of 135th Street,

19:10.149 --> 19:13.360
be on the lookout for a silver BMW
parked in an alleyway.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.445
Possible illicit activity. Over.

19:15.530 --> 19:19.032
This is Officers Watkins and Moreno.
We'll check it out.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.036
Resuming normal radio traffic.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.421
Ten-six unit's on check.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.844
-Get out of the car, sir.
-You're under arrest.

19:41.931 --> 19:46.184
-She's ready to see me?
-l'm sorry, it'll be just a few more minutes.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.358
-Where is Crystal?
-She called. She's on her way.

19:53.442 --> 19:58.405
-Does it take that long to make tea?
-l've got it right here.

20:05.997 --> 20:11.626
-l'm sorry, she'll be right with you.
-Honey, l'm the one sorry for you.

20:11.711 --> 20:16.089
This is boring, boring, boring.
These are all boring.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.592
lt's boring.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.053
The desk.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.266
This is all boring.

20:29.604 --> 20:33.356
Robe Rouge is a magazine.
lt is not a Web site.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.234
We need for this... Look, this layout...

20:36.319 --> 20:39.446
This layout needs to pop.
lt needs to be lush.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.699
We need to make our readers want to buy.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.994
Go back to the drawing board,
give me something with some sort of style,

20:46.078 --> 20:48.371
because this isn't it.
l don't like this, not one bit.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.957
-What about putting Rihanna on the cover?
-No, that's not gonna work.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.375
All right.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.967
l'm so sorry.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.430
Look who finally decides
to show up at work.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.223
So tell me, Crystal, what was it this time?

21:07.308 --> 21:10.894
You overslept,
the babysitter didn't show up. What is it?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.145
l'm sorry.

21:12.229 --> 21:16.858
You know, l have my limits,
even for very good assistants.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.527
Yes, ma'am.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.949
-Katina, where's my binder?
-Yes, l left it here on your desk.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.992
l knew you would need it
for your meeting this morning.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.579
-And my circulation reports?
-Circulation reports are attached.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.706
And your 9:00 is here.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.124
9:00? lt's 1 0:00.

21:34.001 --> 21:38.004
You agreed to meet with Juanita Sims.
She runs a non-profit organization.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.633
-Shall l ask her in?
-lt's fine. Fine.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.059
-Juanita Sims.
-Hi!

21:51.143 --> 21:55.855
l'm Juanita Sims,
and l'm so glad you took this meeting.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.316
Now l'll be quick,
because l know you're very busy.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.403
l read in your magazine
about your upbringing.

22:01.487 --> 22:05.490
l just knew that this would be a program
that you would respond to.

22:05.574 --> 22:10.870
First of all, l'm a nurse, and l have just
opened a free health and wellness clinic

22:11.330 --> 22:16.001
in a community center in one
of the poorest neighborhoods in this city.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.086
Forgive me. l'm just a little nervous.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.088
-As you know...
-Where do l come in?

22:20.381 --> 22:21.589
Well...

22:23.801 --> 22:27.929
lt's a little non-profit, and everything l do
l do out of my own pocket and...

22:28.014 --> 22:29.639
Let me stop you right now.

22:29.724 --> 22:33.768
l give to cancer, l give to Africa,
l give to education.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.230
-Those are my charities of choice.
-Well, those are all very good charities,

22:37.314 --> 22:41.901
but there is so much need
in our own community.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.069
"Our?"

22:43.487 --> 22:47.157
We are all afforded the same opportunities
in "our" community.

22:47.241 --> 22:52.495
What they do with theirs, it is not my issue.
Your answer is no. End of conversation.

22:53.205 --> 22:58.251
-End of conversation?
-Crystal, show Miss Simmons out.

23:01.380 --> 23:06.134
-lt's Sims. Miss Juanita Sims.
-Right this way.

23:08.763 --> 23:09.804
No.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.059
l've been waiting out there
in that damn lobby of yours

23:14.643 --> 23:16.561
for over an hour for you.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.105
Now, it's cool, you don't want
to give any money, l get that.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.693
But this attitude, this blatant disrespect
for other people's time and feelings,

23:23.778 --> 23:27.072
well, honey, that's just ridiculous.
Does it take all of this for you to be that?

23:27.156 --> 23:31.659
Then, honey, if it does, then you
may be paying just a little too much.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.662
And l can see myself
out of this tacky-ass place.

23:34.747 --> 23:40.001
Ain't got no color up in here, all this white.
No color up in this place, including you.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.505
Tacky-ass heifer. Wait till l tell everybody
how tacky you are.

23:43.589 --> 23:47.300
l can show my own self out,
thank you very much.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.594
How do l open this damn door?

23:52.014 --> 23:53.973
This is why
you haven't been able to conceive.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.769
Your fallopian tubes
are scarred here and here.

23:57.853 --> 24:01.439
We usually see this form from
a pelvis infection that was once untreated.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.108
What was once untreated?

24:04.860 --> 24:08.613
-Should we talk alone?
-No, it's okay.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.490
An untreated STD can cause this issue.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.619
ls there a surgery or something
that we could...

24:14.703 --> 24:17.163
l honestly wouldn't recommend it.
lt's very risky.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.543
Right. Okay. Excuse me.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.046
Thank you, Doctor.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.222
Babe.

24:36.016 --> 24:40.562
-Babe. lt's okay. Would you...
-l'm sorry l have to go to work.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.898
Would you talk to me?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.109
Do you know how hard it is
looking at all those people

24:46.193 --> 24:49.863
who do not want the children
that they have? And we...

24:51.157 --> 24:52.907
-Okay, let's talk about it.
-Let's talk later, okay?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.118
We'll talk later.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.412
-l love you.
-l love you, too.

24:59.290 --> 25:04.043
Now, first off,
these condoms are free, okay? They're free.

25:04.128 --> 25:08.631
Now, how many times have you heard
your man say, "lt don't feel the same"?

25:08.716 --> 25:13.678
Yes, you've heard that.
Or he might say, "Baby, l ain't got nothing."

25:13.762 --> 25:16.264
And his ass
ain't even been to the doctor. You...

25:17.850 --> 25:21.769
Excuse me forjust one minute.
Take as many as you think you might need.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.021
Frank.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.442
-Hey, baby.
-Frank.

25:27.526 --> 25:31.154
l don't want to talk to you.
l haven't seen you in four days.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.323
Baby, you know l drive that truck.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.493
Frank, l know you. l can smell her
all over you. You've been with her.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.580
Baby, l've been eating donuts, okay?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.124
Look, l miss you.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.877
You don't miss me.
Look, l'm too old for this shit, Frank.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.004
You don't want to be with me
unless you can't be with her.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.840
-Baby, l love you. l do.
-You don't love me.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.927
Well, if you love me so much,
why don't you leave me the hell alone?

25:54.303 --> 25:56.429
-Now, come on. Don't hurt me like that.
-Hurt you?

25:57.765 --> 26:00.475
Get your ass out of here.
l've got to go talk to my ladies.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.436
-Baby, l just want to kiss those lips.
-Will you...

26:07.107 --> 26:08.608
Okay, ladies.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.697
Remember when you're using your condoms

26:14.782 --> 26:17.116
you need a water-based lubricant.
Where are they?

26:22.790 --> 26:24.082
Sure, why not?

26:24.166 --> 26:26.501
Excuse me.
Let me have a double vodka straight.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.587
What?

26:30.756 --> 26:33.675
You can tell a lot about a man
by what he drinks.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.510
And what does my drink say about me?

26:39.139 --> 26:42.976
That you're married, here on business,

26:43.060 --> 26:46.604
and you want to get a buzz on quick
so that you can have a good time,

26:46.689 --> 26:49.440
forget about the wife at home and all of that.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.651
-Wow.
-Am l right?

26:51.735 --> 26:52.735
Dead on.

26:55.364 --> 26:58.157
-So what are my chances?
-For what?

26:59.994 --> 27:02.078
Having a good time in your beautiful city.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.999
l'll tell you what.

27:06.083 --> 27:10.295
l'm off in a couple of hours.
l could show you around, if you're up for it.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.504
l'd like that.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.310
l kept the dinner warm for you.

27:27.855 --> 27:31.190
-How'd it go today?
-What are you talking about?

27:34.028 --> 27:38.698
-Thought you were gonna look for a job.
-Ain't nobody trying to hire a veteran.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.367
Get me a drink.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.390
You're not doing what l asked you to do.

28:07.561 --> 28:11.022
-l want a damn drink!
-Beau, maybe you shouldn't drink tonight.

28:13.150 --> 28:17.487
-You saying l got a problem?
-l'm saying you need to take your meds.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.490
-Now you're telling me what l should do?
-l'm telling you what l think.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.368
l'm not accusing you of anything.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.328
-Are you hungry?
-What?

28:34.588 --> 28:38.091
-l'm not an alcoholic.
-l know.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.386
l'm trying. l'm trying, Crys.

28:42.096 --> 28:43.471
l know that, too.

28:51.772 --> 28:56.692
l know what the military did to you.
l'm on your side.

28:57.569 --> 29:01.864
l know why you get mad sometimes.
l get mad.

29:03.951 --> 29:07.620
But sometimes when you drink,

29:07.704 --> 29:09.455
you get out of control.

29:10.124 --> 29:13.459
Don't drink tonight, okay?

29:21.552 --> 29:23.302
You love me?

29:29.685 --> 29:33.813
Man, l have loved you
since we were 14 years old.

29:40.821 --> 29:43.531
Ain't nothing changed at all
with Crys, right?

29:46.994 --> 29:50.872
lf you love me,
then why won't you marry me?

29:51.790 --> 29:52.874
Beau.

30:01.925 --> 30:06.345
We got more things to worry about
than getting married.

30:11.101 --> 30:14.937
Listen, l know we had a fight last night,

30:15.022 --> 30:18.441
but the silent treatment
just isn't good for me.

30:18.525 --> 30:24.489
You were supposed to meet for dinner.
Call me. l'm worried about you.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.119
"My papa thought he was Puerto Rican

30:30.204 --> 30:35.416
"We would've been, except we were
Just regular negroes with hints of Spanish

30:35.501 --> 30:38.127
"So off l made it to this 36-hour marathon

30:38.212 --> 30:42.465
"Con salsa con Ricardo Sugar Ray
on Southern Boulevard

30:42.549 --> 30:48.596
"lt was up, up, up, up, up stairs and stairs
And lots of hallway

30:49.556 --> 30:53.809
"My colored New Jersey self
Didn't know what anybody was saying

30:53.894 --> 30:58.898
"Except if dancing was proof of origin
l was Jibarita herself that night

30:58.982 --> 31:03.986
"l kept smiling and right on stepping
lf he could lead, l was ready to dance

31:04.071 --> 31:07.365
"lf he couldn't lead
l caught this attitude l'd seen Rosa do

31:07.449 --> 31:09.450
"And would not be bothered"

31:10.786 --> 31:16.916
-Mrs. Bradmore, are you ready to order?
-No, Danny, l think l'm just gonna go home.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.627
Can you have my driver pull around
and get my coat, please?

31:19.711 --> 31:23.256
-Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am.
-Thank you.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.554
-Hey, Mama.
-Hey.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.653
-You moved my box.
-What?

31:45.737 --> 31:49.574
-l had a box there. Where's my box?
-lt's right there, Mama.

31:49.658 --> 31:53.619
l don't like it when you move my things. l...

31:53.745 --> 31:54.745
l'm sorry.

32:08.552 --> 32:12.888
-l know you're tired, Mama.
-l'm tired.

32:15.684 --> 32:16.934
Come on.

32:21.189 --> 32:25.151
You're my angel.
You're nothing like your sister.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.002
-lt's only $38, Mom.
-That's all l made.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.881
l tried to get some more,
but your sister wouldn't give me any money.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.050
Maybe you shouldn't have told her
it was for me.

32:49.134 --> 32:53.471
l didn't tell her it was for you,
but you know l don't lie.

32:54.056 --> 32:57.183
-l know.
-She can't stand you.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.729
lt's because you're so much better
than she is.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.566
lf l told her that l needed money
for you to better yourself,

33:05.651 --> 33:07.818
she would never give it to me.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.657
She holds on to that wallet
like Jacob holding an angel.

33:14.868 --> 33:19.038
Maybe l can speak to your teachers
and l can pay it off over time.

33:19.373 --> 33:22.667
No, don't. She won't do that.

33:22.751 --> 33:27.129
Miss Yasmine said if l don't get the money,
then l can't get the application to apply.

33:30.092 --> 33:34.178
Elnohim will find a way. Don't worry.

33:38.642 --> 33:42.144
-All right, shall l read?
-Okay.

33:43.689 --> 33:47.149
"And dance is my thank you for music

33:47.651 --> 33:51.487
"And l love you more than dance

33:51.571 --> 33:55.533
"More than Aureliano Buendia
Loved Macondo

"More than Hector Lavoe loved himself

-l told you.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.529
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.824
So, can l come up?

34:38.034 --> 34:40.828
-lt's getting late.
-Okay.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.831
-Well, good night.
-Good night.

34:51.422 --> 34:56.427
Hey, you know what? l was thinking.
Maybe on our next date you can cook.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.972
You know, help a brother save some money.

35:00.056 --> 35:04.643
-l had such a good time, l will do that.
-Nice. Okay.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.439
Go on in. l want to make sure you're safe.

35:12.736 --> 35:13.736
Bye.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.999
Wait, wait, wait.

35:29.336 --> 35:32.296
Look, l got something to tell you.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.550
l only have about $80 on me.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.595
-What are you talking about?
-That's all l have.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.681
lf you want to go to the ATM, we can do that.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.603
You think l'm a hooker?

35:47.687 --> 35:50.189
-Aren't you?
-No!

35:54.986 --> 35:58.405
-l'm sorry. l'm drunk.
-What is so funny?

36:00.158 --> 36:04.036
l guess l'm just old-fashioned.
What kind of woman picks a man up in a bar

36:04.120 --> 36:06.664
and brings him back to her place
if she's not a hooker?

36:06.957 --> 36:09.041
One that likes to fuck.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.753
-Don't laugh at me.
-l'm sorry.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.215
Don't laugh at me.

36:18.051 --> 36:23.013
-This is some sick shit.
-You men with your double standards.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.349
You can do it, but a woman can't.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.727
Get out. Get out!

36:29.646 --> 36:34.108
That's a good idea.
You seem to do this too often to be healthy.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.819
You think l have some kind of disease?

36:39.906 --> 36:43.409
lf it ain't in your body,
it is definitely in your head.

36:46.913 --> 36:51.125
You ain't one to judge me
you son of a bitch!

36:51.209 --> 36:53.711
Now, what do you want?

36:53.795 --> 36:56.338
-Why won't you give Mom some money?
-Don't say a word.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.716
-Q word.
-Bitch.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.844
l make sure that her rent is paid
and that she has groceries.

37:01.928 --> 37:05.264
-What more does she want?
-She needs some money.

37:06.683 --> 37:07.933
For what?

37:10.437 --> 37:14.982
Look, l have to pay
my college application fees.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.233
What?

37:16.693 --> 37:20.821
l got a scholarship to college,
but l have to pay my application fees,

37:20.906 --> 37:22.114
and she didn't want to tell you that,

37:22.198 --> 37:25.075
because she knew you wouldn't do it
if you knew it was for me.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.161
How much?

37:28.538 --> 37:29.705
$300.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.334
Girl, you think l'm Boo Boo the fool?
That don't sound right.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.795
lt's true.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.217
You've been fucking.

37:43.637 --> 37:48.140
-What? No, l haven't.
-l can see it in your face.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.897
-Are you pregnant?
-Not everybody is like you, Tangie.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.776
Yeah, but you are, little sister.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.324
And Mama is so proud of you.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.203
-Wait till she finds out you're pregnant.
-l'm not pregnant.

38:09.579 --> 38:13.916
How you gonna go to college like that?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.335
Mama's gonna die. You know it.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.089
l can't wait.

38:24.344 --> 38:28.931
He didn't use a condom?
Baby, you've got to use a condom.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.725
l remember the first time l got pregnant.

38:34.354 --> 38:35.980
l was so scared.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.199
l went to this apartment on 1 38th.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.955
A red building in the middle of the block.

38:53.039 --> 38:56.834
Down a back alley. Apartment 331 .

38:58.878 --> 39:01.922
l didn't have money
for no college application.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.097
But l wasn't pregnant anymore.

39:15.979 --> 39:18.230
l'm not giving you any money.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.361
l'm not pregnant.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.963
l've been trying to reach you all night.

39:45.175 --> 39:47.342
Yeah, my battery died.

39:47.427 --> 39:52.181
Your battery died. And you couldn't call me
from another phone and tell me that?

40:04.652 --> 40:10.032
You know, Carl, l was so worried about you
that l even called the police.

40:10.116 --> 40:13.243
You called the police? What they say?

40:13.328 --> 40:17.998
They told me to call back in 24 hours,
but you could have at least called me.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.333
Fine, Jo.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.214
This is about the fight the other night,
isn't it?

40:25.298 --> 40:28.425
No. l said my battery died.

40:28.510 --> 40:32.554
Yeah. You're still angry. l can hear it
all in your voice. You're still mad.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.932
Jo, l'm not mad, l'm not angry.

40:37.352 --> 40:40.187
Good, 'cause you don't have a right to be.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.942
Well, you could have told me, you know?

40:47.153 --> 40:49.947
-l could have told you. l could have told you.
-Yeah, you could have told me.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.908
l could have told you just the same way
you could have told me

40:52.992 --> 40:58.372
that you were gonna take $200,000
of my money, put it in some stock,

40:58.456 --> 41:01.792
and you didn't check with me,
not one time, Carl.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.086
lt's always about you and your damn money.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.171
Yes, it is. lt is. l earned it.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.590
Jo, l'm a broker.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.343
Everybody down at the firm
knows who you are.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.053
lt's embarrassing to me

41:13.429 --> 41:18.559
that l can't come home and make a decision
as a man in this house, so l took it.

41:19.644 --> 41:24.231
Okay? l took it, and l said l was sorry.
l don't want to talk about this shit anymore.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.401
That's fine. Don't talk about it.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.279
You're gonna listen.
Yeah, you're gonna listen, Carl.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.781
l know l have issues with trust,

41:32.866 --> 41:37.161
but when you make choices like this,
it doesn't help me, not one bit.

41:37.245 --> 41:41.707
You don't just have trust issues,
you got issues.

41:44.711 --> 41:45.878
l'm gonna go take a shower.

41:46.588 --> 41:49.840
Can l take a shower?
Do l have permission to take a shower?

41:50.258 --> 41:51.592
Thank you.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.564
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.234
You're up late.

42:09.319 --> 42:10.861
l can't sleep.

42:16.326 --> 42:19.703
-How was the rest of your day?
-lt's where l left it.

42:22.123 --> 42:25.334
l understand that.

42:25.418 --> 42:28.587
-Are you hungry?
-No, babe.

42:29.255 --> 42:34.176
-You want to know what happened?
-You want to tell me what happened?

42:35.011 --> 42:37.137
Do you remember my friends from college?

42:37.222 --> 42:39.973
-Kiana and Nicole?
-Yeah.

42:40.767 --> 42:43.852
"The three of us were like a pyramid
Three friends

42:43.937 --> 42:50.484
"One laugh, one music
One flowered shawl knotted on each neck

42:51.444 --> 42:55.030
"We all saw him at the same time

42:55.114 --> 42:56.615
"And he saw us

42:58.534 --> 43:02.037
"l felt a thump in each one of us
Didn't know what to do

43:02.121 --> 43:06.458
"We all wanted what was coming our way
So we split

"The other tzo were tickled

43:21.849 --> 43:25.519
"And spurned his advances

"And then the rose

43:41.953 --> 43:44.663
"l found on my friend's desk"

43:46.958 --> 43:48.959
There was nothing to say.

43:53.631 --> 43:58.010
Eight months later l woke up
with the worst cramps in my life.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.390
And now l can't give you a baby.

44:05.351 --> 44:09.396
Baby, you give me
so much more than l ever need.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.233
l love you. lt doesn't matter.
We'll get through it.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.918
Let me lock up so they don't steal this thing.

44:33.171 --> 44:36.089
-Jesus.
-Hey, baby.

44:36.174 --> 44:40.385
-Leave me alone, Frank.
-Can't we at least talk about it?

44:44.724 --> 44:48.977
Go home.
That's right, you ain't got no home to go to.

44:49.062 --> 44:50.812
-What?
-Somebody told me

44:50.897 --> 44:53.690
you moved out of your apartment.
What you do, move back in with her?

44:53.775 --> 44:58.153
-Hell, no!
-l'm sick of your lies and shit.

44:58.237 --> 45:01.156
Baby. Baby, l'm sorry.

45:01.908 --> 45:05.118
l'm sorry. l don't know why
l keep going back there. l mean...

45:05.203 --> 45:10.457
No, listen. This time it was different, baby.
The whole time l was there, l just...

45:10.541 --> 45:13.126
The whole time
l was just thinking about you.

45:13.211 --> 45:16.630
l mean, listen, if l can't have you, baby,
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.882
What would l look like
letting you back in my life

45:18.966 --> 45:21.843
after all the advice l give
to the women at my clinic?

45:21.928 --> 45:25.680
-Babe, listen to me.
-Frank, you listen.

45:25.765 --> 45:29.267
Every time l let you move back in,
you do the same thing,

45:29.352 --> 45:32.229
and every time l come home
and you're not here, l do the same thing.

45:32.313 --> 45:34.898
l go through that closet,
l go through the drawers

45:34.982 --> 45:36.441
to see if your things are gone!

45:36.526 --> 45:38.652
l have to set an example for my women!

45:38.736 --> 45:41.863
You want me to be honest.
Now, l'm telling you the truth.

45:41.948 --> 45:45.367
-Baby, please...
-l'm not listening to this shit no more!

45:45.451 --> 45:48.370
lf you meant that, how come
you didn't say it in the first damn place?

45:48.454 --> 45:54.376
Because l didn't know how. Okay?
l didn't know how. Kiss me, sweetie.

45:54.544 --> 45:57.087
-Frank, just leave. Okay?
-Just kiss me. Kiss me.

45:57.171 --> 46:02.634
-Frank, no. Go. Frank. Frank.
-You love me. You love me, baby.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.177
-Frank.
-l love you, sweetheart.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.847
-Oh, my God, l love the way you smell.
-Frank. Frank, no. Frank.

46:06.931 --> 46:11.476
l missed you so much, baby.
Let me stay. Please, let me stay.

46:11.561 --> 46:12.811
Frank.

46:15.314 --> 46:18.316
You got any condoms?

46:22.947 --> 46:25.782
l called Dr. Belken.
He can see you this afternoon.

46:25.867 --> 46:26.908
Okay.

46:26.993 --> 46:30.078
These are from your husband.
He's on line three.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.958
What a pleasant surprise.

46:35.042 --> 46:37.377
Look, babe, l just called to tell you

46:37.462 --> 46:40.714
how sorry l was for the way
l've been acting the last few days.

46:40.798 --> 46:41.798
You're so right.

46:41.883 --> 46:46.052
l should not have taken the money
out of your account.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.138
l guess l just thought...

46:49.849 --> 46:53.268
Well, l thought l was helping you,
or us, l should say.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.020
And l thought it would gain interest,

46:55.104 --> 46:58.315
and l thought it would make you
really proud of me.

46:58.399 --> 46:59.774
But obviously l was wrong,

46:59.859 --> 47:05.238
so l'm just gonna say l don't blame you
for taking my name off the account.

47:06.365 --> 47:10.452
lt won't happen again, baby.
l'm really sorry.

47:10.536 --> 47:11.661
Thank you.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.625
l got you tickets to the opera tonight.

47:16.709 --> 47:20.128
You really must be sorry
if you're gonna sit through that again.

47:20.213 --> 47:23.381
What did you call it last time? Water torture.

47:23.466 --> 47:27.719
Yeah, water torture. Water torture.
But not with you, babe. Anything for you.

47:28.054 --> 47:30.013
See you tonight.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.807
-Bye.
-Bye.

47:32.892 --> 47:35.227
-l love you.
-l love you, too.

47:37.313 --> 47:38.396

-You Yasmine?
-Yeah.

48:03.756 --> 48:07.842
-lt's your birthday?
-No, just a guy l went to dinner with.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.053
He's nice. A gentleman.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.430
He wants to fuck you.

48:14.433 --> 48:15.934
Can l help you with something?

48:17.853 --> 48:21.898
Yeah, l'm here to pay
for the college application.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.026
l don't know what you mean.

48:25.528 --> 48:29.281
Sorry, l'm Tangie, Nyla's sister,

48:29.365 --> 48:35.412
and she said that she had $300 to pay
for a college application or something.

48:35.788 --> 48:39.207
-No, everything here is free.
-What?

48:39.292 --> 48:41.001
Everything here is free.

48:41.085 --> 48:44.296
Nyla's one of my best students. l'm sure
she won't have trouble getting in anywhere.

-Very difficult to press charges against.
-He's not a friend.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:38.934
You'll hear things like,

"She knew him. She must have wanted it.

One sip of wine. l don't drink.

to be legitimate.

with closed mouth,

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:03.060
pressing charges will be as hard

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:09.024
as trying to keep your legs closed
while five fools try to run a train on you.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:14.071

"'Cause nobody knew

of myself.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:03.086
-Oh, no! No! No!
-What's going on?

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:08.341
Crazy-ass man dropped the children
out the fifth-story window.

01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:12.804
Why'd he do that?

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:14.765
l apologize in advance,

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:18.685
but l'm gonna have to ask
each of you a few questions.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:22.522
-Did each of you witness what happened?
-Yes.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:26.026
-How do you all know each other?
-Well, l don't know...

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:29.154
l'm the manager of the apartments.
l live next door to her.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.281
-She's my assistant.
-Okay.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.365
Donald.

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.205
Excuse me.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:53.720
-What?
-What did you do? What did you do?

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:58.058
-Mama! Stop it, Mama!
-You sent her there. You sent her there.

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:04.689
-You are the darkness. What did you do?
-You all right, baby?

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:10.362
Get out. Get out.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.823
Do you even know her name?

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:16.076
Do you even know her?
Do you know anything about her? Get out!

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.704
-Get out! Get out before l kill you! Get out!
-No, no. Mama, stop it!

01:14:24.544 --> 01:14:26.002
What's wrong with you?

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:30.215
Letting all these men
crawl up inside you like that.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:34.511
How can you have any relationship
with God inside me?

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.017
She could've killed her.

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.522
-She could've killed me.
-l was with you!

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.440
-You think that made it okay?
-Yes!

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.192
-l didn't want to be there!
-l was with you!

01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:52.070
-l didn't want to be there!
-l was watching her!

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:53.572
You weren't by yourself!

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.408
l didn't want to be... You made me go!

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:12.549
She's an alcoholic demon.
She could've killed her.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:21.558
You sent her there alone.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:42.787
The pair of you
could not have come from me.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.214
He only left you that money

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.176
so you could control me,

01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.179
like he did.

01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:07.395
He used to put his hands up my dress,

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.526
told me l was the only one he needed.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:24.079
He told me l was ugly.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:34.130
And when l was 1 5,
he gave me to a white man.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:39.261
He said he wanted beautiful grand-girls.

01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:41.721
No.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.015
Not like me.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:52.357
He said, "Don't sleep with the darkness."

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:59.990
-And then you came.
-Mama, please stop lying.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.162
-He touched you.
-Shut up!

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:09.040
He touched you, too.

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:15.046
l can tell. l can smell it on you.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:20.093
You don't know me.

A part of me knows this happened,
but most of me feels like l'm dreaming.

Am l awake?

No, l like you, too.
Hey, you better be careful...

-You happy now, Tangie?
-What're you doing in there?

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.672
You sent me to that woman and you knew.

01:31:55.218 --> 01:32:00.181
You should have told me
that the $300 was for an abortion,

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:02.892
instead of lying like you did.

01:32:07.731 --> 01:32:11.609
-Baby. Baby, who's that?
-That's just my sister.

Sweetie, with a mother like ours,
you better learn how to laugh,

01:48:52.067 --> 01:48:54.736
Then save some other woman's babies.

01:48:56.864 --> 01:49:01.326
Help another woman who's missing
what you're missing.

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:04.913
There's too much life wrapped in your voice.

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:09.000
You gotta get up from here.

01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:32.106
Come on. Come on, baby.

01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:36.736
Come on.

01:49:42.117 --> 01:49:45.453
Come on, baby. Come on. Come.

01:49:47.289 --> 01:49:50.250
lt's all right.

01:49:50.334 --> 01:49:51.876
Now, Crystal.

01:49:56.215 --> 01:49:58.508
Crystal, l want you to breathe.

01:50:01.303 --> 01:50:05.932
Come on.

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:10.061
Yes. Yes.

01:50:10.145 --> 01:50:13.982
Yes, baby, that's right.
That's right, baby, breathe.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.950
Breathe. Breathe for me. That's right.

01:50:25.995 --> 01:50:28.663
My last husband,
I had a detective follow him,

01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:32.125
and even though l didn't do that with you,

01:50:36.672 --> 01:50:41.843
l know l ignored everything in me
to be with you.

01:50:46.015 --> 01:50:50.184
Baby, why don't you just tell me
what the hell you're talking about?

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:59.360
l went to my gynecologist,

01:50:59.445 --> 01:51:04.407
and before you,
every level in my body was fine.

01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:11.664
Baby, are you sick? Talk to me.

01:51:15.252 --> 01:51:17.211
Tell me the truth, Carl.

01:51:18.422 --> 01:51:20.757
Who have you been sleeping with?

01:51:22.426 --> 01:51:24.719
Jo, l promise you since...

01:51:24.803 --> 01:51:27.347
Since you and l have been together,
l have not slept with another woman,

01:51:27.431 --> 01:51:29.349
and l promise you that.

01:51:37.232 --> 01:51:42.028
-What about a man?
-What the fuck did you just ask me?

01:51:42.613 --> 01:51:47.158
l see the way you look at them
when you think l'm not paying attention.

01:51:47.242 --> 01:51:52.080
l see it.
The pool boy in the Hamptons, my driver,

01:51:53.749 --> 01:51:57.293
the guy the other night at the opera.
l see it all, Carl.

01:52:02.132 --> 01:52:03.758
You have no idea

01:52:05.427 --> 01:52:10.223
how much l hate coming up
into this motherfucking house sometimes.

01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:14.435
Every day, Joanna,
if it ain't you telling me what to wear,

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:17.105
how to look, calling the shots over my head.

01:52:18.857 --> 01:52:20.358
Are you gay?

01:52:20.442 --> 01:52:22.819
How you gonna ask me a question like that?

01:52:22.945 --> 01:52:25.363
How did you marry a woman,

01:52:26.949 --> 01:52:30.785
and then turn around
and let a man bend you over?

01:52:31.787 --> 01:52:33.538
Ain't nobody bending me over.

01:52:35.290 --> 01:52:38.960
So you doing the bending?
ls that what it is?

01:52:40.462 --> 01:52:42.046
l don't wake up holding another man,

01:52:42.131 --> 01:52:45.133
walking down the street
holding some man's hands.

01:52:45.217 --> 01:52:46.843
That's gay, okay?

01:52:49.555 --> 01:52:51.639
That ain't me.

01:52:53.642 --> 01:52:57.520
You're saying a lie, Carl. You're saying
a lot without saying nothing at all.

01:53:05.487 --> 01:53:06.821
l'm saying

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:14.203
that your husband is a man, Jo.

01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:20.793
l'm a man every day of the week.

01:53:22.671 --> 01:53:24.005
l'm a man.

01:53:28.844 --> 01:53:32.346
l'm just a man who enjoys

01:53:34.183 --> 01:53:35.766
having sex

01:53:40.105 --> 01:53:42.023
with another man, Jo.

01:53:45.152 --> 01:53:47.862
No attachments, no fucking...

01:53:49.156 --> 01:53:51.324
No relationship,

01:53:51.408 --> 01:53:55.036
just sex, you know?

01:53:59.208 --> 01:54:02.335
That's what l'm saying,

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:03.920
and l'm sorry.

01:54:11.512 --> 01:54:13.012
l'm sorry, Jo,

01:54:17.726 --> 01:54:19.185
for my truth.

01:54:23.524 --> 01:54:25.191
"Save your sorry

01:54:27.528 --> 01:54:30.780
"One thing l don't need

"A sign on the door
Better yet, l'm gonna leave a voicemail

"A message on my voicemail

01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:01.602
"'lf you called to say you're sorry
Then call somebody else

01:55:01.687 --> 01:55:04.188
"'Cause l don't use them anymore'

01:55:04.273 --> 01:55:09.360
"l let... l let 'l'm sorry, l didn't mean to'

01:55:10.529 --> 01:55:11.696
"And 'how could l know about that?'

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:15.408
"Take a walk down a dark and musty street
ln Brooklyn, Carl

01:55:20.289 --> 01:55:25.126
"Well, l'm gonna do exactly what l want
And l'm not gonna be sorry for none of it

"Let sorry soothe your soul

"l'll soothe mine

"You know
You were always being inconsistent

"Doing things
And then saying you're sorry about it

When l get back, l want you gone

01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:40.219
and take your HlV with you.

01:57:56.486 --> 01:57:58.028
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:57:58.113 --> 01:58:00.865
And l am just so excited that you came.
l want you to meet everybody.

01:58:00.949 --> 01:58:03.159
Ladies? Ladies?

01:58:03.243 --> 01:58:06.996
This is Miss Bradmore. She's the one
who gave us all the money. Yes!

01:58:09.291 --> 01:58:11.625
Now, now, l want to show you the roof.
l'm just so excited.

01:58:11.710 --> 01:58:13.711
We had it fixed because of you!

01:58:19.468 --> 01:58:20.593
Mama!

01:58:24.848 --> 01:58:26.015
Come on.

01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:31.270
-l brought her some things.
-ls it ticking?

01:58:32.147 --> 01:58:33.481
Where is she?

01:58:35.525 --> 01:58:36.859
Over here.

01:58:39.404 --> 01:58:41.864
Nyla.

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:43.491
Hey, Mommy.

01:58:44.326 --> 01:58:46.118
l'm so proud of you.

01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:57.338
-You want some food, Mama?
-No.

01:58:58.590 --> 01:58:59.882
l have to go.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:06.555
This is the devil's music.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.599
Yes, it is.

01:59:11.144 --> 01:59:13.145
How many women in your classes have HlV?

01:59:13.688 --> 01:59:18.943
Two out of four, and usually
from someone they trusted or loved.

01:59:19.027 --> 01:59:22.238
You know, l don't know what's worse,
if it's the betrayal or the virus.

01:59:22.322 --> 01:59:25.950
HlV is not the death sentence
that it used to be.

01:59:26.034 --> 01:59:28.619
l mean,
l have patients that are on their meds

01:59:28.703 --> 01:59:32.540
and have great lives and have been
living them for the last 20 years.

01:59:33.041 --> 01:59:35.125
Women just give up so much.

01:59:37.462 --> 01:59:39.129
Just so much of their power.

01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:43.592
lt can happen to any of us.
Anyone that's in love.

01:59:45.387 --> 01:59:47.805
Miss Juanita, look who's here.

01:59:47.889 --> 01:59:49.390
-l can't believe...
-Crystal!

01:59:49.474 --> 01:59:52.810
...l'm having such a good time
and there's no man around.

01:59:52.894 --> 01:59:55.479
Well, you leave that where it is.

01:59:55.564 --> 01:59:59.483
My love is too beautiful
to have thrown back on my face.

01:59:59.568 --> 02:00:01.485
-That's true.
-l like that.

02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:04.321
-Try one.
-What?

02:00:04.406 --> 02:00:05.990
Well, l do it all the time in my class.

02:00:06.074 --> 02:00:09.785
You just say, "My love is too..."
and then you fill in the blank.

02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:14.790
"My love is too sanctified
To have thrown back in my face"

02:00:14.875 --> 02:00:19.086
-All right, now see?
-"My love is too magic

02:00:19.921 --> 02:00:22.631
"To have thrown back in my face

02:00:22.716 --> 02:00:27.261

"My love is too music
To have thrown back on my face

02:00:32.142 --> 02:00:36.520
"My love is too Saturday night
To have thrown back on my face"

02:00:36.605 --> 02:00:37.855
Yes, and you remember that

02:00:37.939 --> 02:00:41.692
when a man tries to walk off
with all of your stuff.

02:00:41.776 --> 02:00:46.196
l know that's right,
or saying sorry a million times.

02:00:46.281 --> 02:00:49.742
We all have "l'm sorry" stories, don't we?

02:00:50.035 --> 02:00:54.079
"Get this. Just last week
My ex old man comes in saying

02:00:54.164 --> 02:00:57.791
"'Baby, l don't know

02:00:57.876 --> 02:01:02.087
"No, no, this is it

02:01:02.172 --> 02:01:05.591
-"'l'm sorry'

"'Our inadequacies

lt's okay.

02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:02.690
l asked myself,

02:02:05.402 --> 02:02:07.528
how l could let that happen.

02:02:15.745 --> 02:02:17.079

"A child and endlessly weaving garments
For the moon

02:06:08.603 --> 02:06:10.354
