00:47.020 --> 00:49.900
A beautiful babygirl.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.740
Yes. Yes,
she's just perfect.

00:54.820 --> 00:58.740
I'll giveyou to Sister Yvonne.
She's dying to talk toyou.

01:00.380 --> 01:03.780
Mrs. York,
wait until you see her.

01:03.860 --> 01:06.100
She's a tiny miracle.

01:08.220 --> 01:12.660
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.260
Then we'll expect you.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.140
All right. Bye.

01:20.940 --> 01:23.780
The clouds sweep away the color.

01:26.460 --> 01:31.260
Leaves everything like
a black and white photograph.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.180
Tell me about the parents. Any history
of drug abuse or alcohol addiction?

02:00.260 --> 02:03.700
We're supplying the environment,
but we're inheriting the genes,

02:03.780 --> 02:08.699
whether the mother was traumatized
during the period of gestation.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.060
It's all important.

02:11.140 --> 02:14.580
You're going to be the mother
ofthis child, not her lawyer.

02:14.620 --> 02:18.700
Right. Sister, I'm so sorry.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.620
I'm soinsecure aboutall this.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.620
You know we tried so hard.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.580
I'm not anxious to take on a load
of problems I'm not prepared for.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.780
-She has a "sins of the father thing".
-I do not.

02:29.820 --> 02:34.260
The mother was at university
and the fatherwas an exchange student.

02:34.340 --> 02:37.460
Sweetheart, ifthere are
any complications,

02:37.540 --> 02:39.060
psychological or physical,
we'll handle it.

02:39.140 --> 02:41.740
She's got us.
My best friend's a doctor.

02:41.820 --> 02:44.180
Besides, I play racquetball
with a couple ofgood shrinks.

02:44.220 --> 02:46.180
You're such a wise guy.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.780
She's beautiful.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.260
It's okay.

03:11.300 --> 03:14.580
Oh, she's beautiful.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.980
Bye, bye.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.180
Bye.

04:37.180 --> 04:41.420
Hush, little baby
Don'tsaya word

04:41.500 --> 04:45.740
Mommy's gonnabuyyouamockingbird
Want togo tosleep?

04:45.820 --> 04:47.740
Shh!

04:47.820 --> 04:50.540
Quiet, quiet.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.140
-Ooh.
-Ta-da

04:54.220 --> 04:57.020
She's beautiful!

04:57.100 --> 04:59.380
Everybody, I'd like you to meet...

04:59.420 --> 05:01.940
Delia.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.540
What's she gonna sing?

05:03.620 --> 05:06.900
-Any requests?
-I don't know. When she's hungry,

05:06.980 --> 05:09.340
she can hit notes Tina Turner
hasn't thought of.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.660
Ow!

05:16.700 --> 05:18.780
She scratched me.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.460
Excuse me. Doctor in the house.

05:21.540 --> 05:25.100
Let's take a look at this.
It's nothing. You'll be all right.

05:25.180 --> 05:27.700
I don't know what happened.

05:27.780 --> 05:31.060
She stopped crying as soon as Gene
picked her up. I don't know what I did.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.700
Aye-yie-yie!

05:33.780 --> 05:36.820
Maybe this pin came undone
whileyou were burping her.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.820
-What museum did we get this from?
-I take fullblame.

05:39.900 --> 05:45.140
I was the one who insisted that she go
aunatural with diapers and safety pins.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.740
Well, I don't think
it merits a law suit.

05:47.820 --> 05:50.580
-Butyou come see me in the morning.
-Okay.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.780
Come on. Here. Come on.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.980
-Delia, don't scratch your mommy.
-You okay?

06:04.380 --> 06:06.900
An eclipse is hardly an event,
SisterYvonne.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.060
Hardly an event?
A spontaneous eclipse?

06:10.140 --> 06:14.220
Howmanyspontaneous eclipses
haveyouseeninyourlife?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.060
Don't speak to me
in that fashion!

06:16.140 --> 06:20.660
You've damned us,
cursed us with that child!

06:20.700 --> 06:25.420
I can think ofno worse curse
than the murder ofa child!

06:25.500 --> 06:28.660
-We should never have been born!
-Be quiet!

06:28.700 --> 06:31.060
DearFatherin heaven,
we are heartilysorry...

06:31.100 --> 06:34.100
Quiet!

06:45.260 --> 06:47.100
No!

07:23.260 --> 07:25.100
I don't believe this.

07:25.180 --> 07:30.140
Yeah, well,
antibiotics willstop it.

07:30.220 --> 07:34.220
But those red marks
mean serious infection, don't they?

07:36.180 --> 07:39.580
How can a baby's fii ngernail
do so much damage?

07:39.660 --> 07:43.220
Who knows? I had a client who got
athlete's foot in the Caribbean.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.260
She almost lost her leg.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.540
-Yeah, Lou, but this...
-Karen, I'm a doctor.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.500
I've seen every conceivable type
ofinfection, believe me.

07:51.580 --> 07:54.460
On a scale ofone to ten,
this is a big two.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.780
The good news is,
you gotyour baby!

07:57.860 --> 08:00.700
-Yeah.
-No more testing. Isn't that a relief?

08:00.780 --> 08:03.180
-Just my annual PAP smear.
-That's right.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.260
I just don't get it.
Gene and I have been tested.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.620
We're both okay. I should've
been pregnant a dozen times by now.

08:08.700 --> 08:13.140
Karen, that happens to lots ofcouples.
Three times a day.

08:13.180 --> 08:17.380
-Thankyou.
-WhatmadeyouandGene decide
on thename "Delia"?

08:17.460 --> 08:19.700
-It's a pretty name, isn't it?
-Beautiful.

08:19.780 --> 08:22.220
It means "always visible" in Greek.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.420
Besides, IhadanAuntDelia...

08:24.500 --> 08:27.820
who was the fiirst woman
in ourhometown torun foroffiice.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.540
Thought it might be
a good-luck name as well.

08:30.620 --> 08:34.740
-Oh, yeah? Grooming her for offiice?
-It's a family tradition.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.220
Nowsanctify this water...

08:50.300 --> 08:54.220
that Your servants who are washed in it
may become one...

08:54.300 --> 08:57.100
with Christ's death
andresurrection,

08:57.180 --> 08:59.100
tobe cleansed
anddeliveredfromsin.

08:59.180 --> 09:04.020
Anoint them with Your HolySpirit, that
theymaybeborn again in Your church,

09:04.100 --> 09:07.500
that theymaybecomeinheritors
ofYourglorious kingdom.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.140
Delia, Ibaptizeyou...

09:12.220 --> 09:14.220

09:21.020 --> 09:24.780
Theysay thata child thatcries
is closerto God.

10:50.940 --> 10:53.620
Thereyou go. Right there.

10:53.660 --> 10:56.580
Yes, Delia!
Isn't that beautiful?

10:56.660 --> 10:59.020
Boo!

10:59.100 --> 11:03.060
Boo! Yeah.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.980
Say "hi".

11:05.020 --> 11:08.340
Hi, Daddy. Whoops.

11:23.820 --> 11:25.660
Don'tyou look pretty!

11:30.980 --> 11:33.620
Smile nice, Mr. Congressman.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.900
Dropyour drawers forCapitolHill.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.740
Sure was convenient...

11:43.820 --> 11:46.100
that somebody took that picture
of Resnick in the motel room.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.820
Who cares who took it?
Someone nailed the incumbent.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.180
Resnick is a crook
and whoremonger.

11:51.260 --> 11:53.100
Those photographs
will bury him.

11:53.180 --> 11:57.620
You've had six weeks to think about it.
What doyou say?

11:57.660 --> 12:00.140
-Why doyou want me to run,Jake?
-Fishing.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.980
For answers, not compliments.
You know what I stand for.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.220
How many hours haveyou spent
complaining to me...

12:05.300 --> 12:08.380
about the bungling bureaucracy
and howyou'd change things?

12:08.460 --> 12:10.500
A couple thousand at least.

12:10.580 --> 12:13.300
Nowis the time toput
somemuscle whereyourmouth is.

12:13.340 --> 12:16.020
A lot ofus agree with you
and think they all ought to take...

12:16.100 --> 12:20.340
theirsweetdeals, perks
andbulgingpensions andtakeahike.

12:20.380 --> 12:24.980
You'reyoung. Youdon'tneedthemoney.
Youcome from apoliticalfamily.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.660
You've got the looks, the brains.
Everything that spells voter appeal.

12:28.740 --> 12:32.340
-I said, no compliments.
-That was the downside.

12:32.420 --> 12:36.500
Wait till you hear
what I like aboutyou.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.500
Gene York,
popular Virginia legislator,

12:39.540 --> 12:42.900
has announcedhe willrun forcongress
forthe 14th Districtseat...

12:42.980 --> 12:45.860

12:45.940 --> 12:48.620
Exitpolls at this timeindicate...

12:48.700 --> 12:53.660
that Gene York should win the 14th
Districtbyan unprecedentedmajority.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.420
You've got a meeting
with Noland tomorrow at 2:00.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.180
Congressman York,
newchair ofthe Finance Committee,

13:02.260 --> 13:04.820
has been fiighting for
thehomeless reliefbill.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.180
Look overthere,Jake.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.660
Look at this.

13:53.740 --> 13:56.620
She almost took the head clean off!

13:57.700 --> 14:00.780
She's real rough on prom queens.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.020
llie, ollie, oxen free

14:04.100 --> 14:07.260
I'll find you
behind a tree

14:09.180 --> 14:11.180
-Boo!
-Boo.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.340
Boo!

14:26.940 --> 14:30.540
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

14:30.620 --> 14:33.540

14:36.980 --> 14:39.380
Delia, this isn't funny!

14:39.460 --> 14:41.300
Delia.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.060
Delia!

14:45.140 --> 14:47.500

14:47.540 --> 14:49.340
Delia!

14:50.780 --> 14:53.740
Delia, come out now, please.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.260
Delia!

14:57.220 --> 14:58.780
Delia!

15:20.620 --> 15:22.620
No! No!

15:27.180 --> 15:29.100
Delia!

15:29.180 --> 15:31.700
-Lookwhatyou've done, you dumb dog!
-No, no, no!

15:31.780 --> 15:34.860
He saved my daughter's life.
Areyou okay, baby?

15:34.940 --> 15:37.580
Areyou okay? Yeah?

15:38.940 --> 15:41.300
He's beenbathed,
hadhis shots.

15:43.580 --> 15:46.260
All checked out. He's fii ne.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.460
She adores him.
He adores her.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.660
Okay, okay.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.660
He'dbegoodprotection
forhertoo.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.620
Congressman Gene York

16:00.660 --> 16:03.660
byissuing arenewedpledge for

16:03.740 --> 16:07.220
Thepopular Virginia congressman
continues toleadallpolls.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.900
I thinkwe should
get one thing clear.

16:09.940 --> 16:12.340
You guys don't know
whatyou're doing.

16:32.620 --> 16:37.060
There's a witch
wholives on top ofthat tower.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.620
Anyone who has the courage
to climb that ladder,

16:39.700 --> 16:42.500
will be granted
anywish theywant.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.580
I could do it
if I wanted to.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.940
-You're afraid ofheights.
-No, I'm not.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.220
I'm not talking toyou,Jerome.

17:21.180 --> 17:23.060
Miss Norris!

17:25.780 --> 17:27.819
Whatis going on?

17:33.180 --> 17:37.180
-But he hit her! Her lip was cut.
-I've heard enough!

17:37.220 --> 17:39.860
Ifhe did,
she probably deserved it.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.500
She spit at him. Bit him so hard
his hand swelled up.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.500
You've got a psycho
for a daughter.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.740
And you, Mr. Congressman,
see what happens next election.

17:48.820 --> 17:52.820
Mr. Creighton,
I never bow to threats.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.180
Please leave
before I lose my temper.

18:03.660 --> 18:06.060
Whata fiirst-classjerk.

18:06.140 --> 18:07.980
Doyousupposeithappened...

18:08.060 --> 18:11.700
the way Delia told us it happened?

18:11.780 --> 18:14.140
Sure.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.580
Why not?

18:32.340 --> 18:34.580
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, Daddy.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.900
Tell me.

18:37.980 --> 18:42.940
Exactlywhat kind ofproblems haveyou
been having with this boy at school?

18:43.020 --> 18:45.540
He's always doing something to me.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.420
Calling me names or hitting me.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.620
Areyou sureyou didn't start it?

18:52.700 --> 18:56.900
He started it by putting his gum
in my hair that very fii rst day.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.260
I know. I remember.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.740
How about doing your dad a big favor,
and staying far away from him?

19:04.820 --> 19:07.380
That whole family is trouble.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.300
Daddy, there won't be any trouble.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.580
That's my girl.

19:13.660 --> 19:16.020
I promise.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.540
-Can you identify this one for me?
-Killerwhale!

19:20.620 --> 19:22.940
Andwhere does itgo?

19:23.020 --> 19:26.260
That's perfect. You got it.
We're fii nished. Recess. Thankyou.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.100
Hey!

19:33.140 --> 19:34.980
Gimme mywatch back!

19:36.860 --> 19:38.740

19:41.740 --> 19:46.580

-You're so brave, come get it!

19:46.620 --> 19:49.540
I'm gonna tell Miss Norris.

19:49.620 --> 19:54.980
"I'm gonna tell Miss Norris".
You big crybaby.

20:03.980 --> 20:06.300
Come on,Jerome!

20:20.780 --> 20:22.980
Teacher!

20:42.100 --> 20:45.540
I warned you about this,
but no, you're not gonna pay attention.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.500
That kid is trouble!
I mean it!

20:47.580 --> 20:49.500
You'll hear from me.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.140
Lookat the children.
They don'tpayanyattention toher.

22:01.180 --> 22:04.740
-Shestillhasn'tmade friends.
-Somekids takemore time.

22:04.820 --> 22:09.700
-Besides, she's more mature than most.
-Yeah.

Honey, it's a fiirstday

22:42.860 --> 22:45.260

22:46.860 --> 22:48.940
Hi, honey.

22:49.020 --> 22:51.780
Let's go, Delia.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.220
Delia!

23:42.380 --> 23:45.420
-Delia!
-Don't move her. I'll get help.

23:53.460 --> 23:56.500
It looks likeyou're gonna be
our guest for a while, Delia.

23:56.580 --> 23:59.380
-Hi, sweetheart. What is it?
-Let's talk outside.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.300
Be right back, honey.

24:08.340 --> 24:10.780
Thankyou.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.700
What?

24:12.780 --> 24:15.780
You can relax.
There's no sign ofinternal bleeding,

24:15.860 --> 24:20.300
butl'm gonnarun a couple tests
andtakesomeXrays.

24:20.380 --> 24:23.620
Aside from a fewbruises
andmaybeaslightconcussion...

24:23.700 --> 24:27.020
Thank God.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.220
I still don't understand
why that horse bolted.

24:30.300 --> 24:34.140
That happens sometimes, Gene.
Especiallywhen a child...

24:34.220 --> 24:36.140
-is becoming a woman.
-What?

24:36.220 --> 24:38.340
Delia started menstruating.

24:38.420 --> 24:41.900
That's impossible.
She's only eightyears old.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.820
It's notimpossible.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.940
It's rare, but it's not impossible.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.860
I'll helpyou explain it to her
ifyou want.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.460
Yeah.

24:49.540 --> 24:52.740
Youlook tired, Karen.
Youcanaffordsomehelp.

24:52.820 --> 24:56.020
She's old enough. Do it.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.180
-So sorry to have keptyou waiting.
-It's okay.

25:03.260 --> 25:07.300
Just got off the phone with the agency.
They gaveyou a four-star rating.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.980
They like to recommend me
for special families.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.300
Special families?

25:13.340 --> 25:17.620
Families with special needs.
I like a challenge.

25:17.660 --> 25:20.740
Well, welcome to the Olympics.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.020
Come up.
I wantyou to meet Delia.

25:27.340 --> 25:31.380
That's Ryder. He's friendly. Delia?

25:31.420 --> 25:34.580
-I'd like you to meet Miss Thueson.
-Jo. Please call me Jo.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.740
Short forJosephine.
First names are more friendly.

25:37.820 --> 25:40.140
-Hello.
-Hi, there, Delia.

25:44.380 --> 25:47.340
-What's this?
-That's a healing crystal.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.460
Isn't thatpretty?

25:55.020 --> 25:57.940
Come on, I'll showyou
toyour room.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.860
I'm notanti-business,Jake.

25:59.900 --> 26:02.980
But I'm not gonna letyou
pave over parks with concrete eyesores.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.540
You cripple construction,
you cripple the country.

26:06.620 --> 26:10.380
You campaigned for me soyou could have
a connection on the Hill.

26:10.460 --> 26:13.140
-I don't deserve that.
-You've gotten greedy.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.020
You're trying to turn me
into what we both hated.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.660
Good boy, Ryder.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.940
Yeah. Good boy.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.660
Come on. Come on, Ryder.

26:36.220 --> 26:40.020
-They grow like that with points?
-Mm-hmm.

26:40.060 --> 26:43.180
The Book ofLight.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.340
That's all about healing and crystals.

26:45.420 --> 26:48.300
And stupidjunk!

26:48.380 --> 26:50.900
I'm going out to play.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.780
Delia, come back here.

26:52.860 --> 26:57.220
No, it's okay, Mrs. York.
Let her get used to me a little.

26:57.300 --> 27:01.460
She'll get used toyou
after she apologizes. Excuse me.

27:02.860 --> 27:04.900
Delia!

27:21.660 --> 27:23.940
They're all black!

27:35.620 --> 27:38.900
Noah, canyoucome over?
Ineedto talk.

27:38.940 --> 27:42.660
You feel it too?
Tightening in the throat?

27:42.740 --> 27:45.860
-Yeah.
-Ever since I got here.

27:45.940 --> 27:48.220
Energy's real low.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.820
Look at my palms.

27:54.780 --> 27:57.860
-Is that the girl?
-Yeah.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.300
What doyou get from her?
Anything?

28:00.380 --> 28:02.500
Very weird.

28:02.580 --> 28:07.740
It's more like a... It's more
like a muddy pool than an aura.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.860
It's like mud and molasses.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.780
Swirls ofred paint.

28:12.860 --> 28:15.100
Does that mean
what I think it does?

28:15.180 --> 28:17.780
A verynegative life force.

28:17.820 --> 28:21.180
-Red means violence.
-She's got a violent streak, all right.

28:21.260 --> 28:26.260
Swirled together like that,
it means rage and chaos.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.260
Is she dangerous?

28:29.340 --> 28:31.500
Why don'tyou get her
on my turf?

28:31.580 --> 28:33.860
Bring her to the fair.
Let others see her.

28:33.940 --> 28:36.180
That was my plan.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.980
Why don'tyou get out?
I'll seeyou at the fair.

28:39.060 --> 28:42.660
-Areyou all right?
-Yeah.

29:18.100 --> 29:22.620
Your creepy friend
almost caused an accident.

29:22.700 --> 29:26.100
-Was he drunk?
-No, Mrs. York.

29:26.180 --> 29:29.500
He was sick.
You saw him, Delia.

29:29.580 --> 29:33.420
He was sweating,
he couldhardly catch his breath.

29:35.420 --> 29:38.260
Maybe he was sick.

29:59.660 --> 30:03.900
-Jo said she saw what?
-She saw
an inverted cross on the mirror.

30:03.980 --> 30:06.740
I'm sure there's some explanation
for it. You can handle it.

30:06.780 --> 30:09.380
I know I can handle it.
I just wanted to talk toyou about it.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.940
I've got a committee meeting.
I've gotta go.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.580
Yousawthe crossyourself.

30:15.660 --> 30:18.140
No, I don't know.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.020
I don't know anything anymore.
I'm tired.

30:21.060 --> 30:24.980
I knowyou're tired.
That's why I'm here.

30:25.020 --> 30:29.540
I understand kids.
Theyjust want to fiit in.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.940
Let me take her out this weekend,
just the two ofus.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.900
-There's a psychic fair.
-Psychic fair. Psychic fair?

30:36.980 --> 30:40.500
I don't know. I don't want Delia
getting involved in anything strange.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.940
There's nothing strange
about metaphysics and new thought.

30:42.980 --> 30:46.100
It's very positive.
She'll be one up on her friends.

30:46.140 --> 30:50.380
-She doesn't have any friends.
-Maybe she'll make new friends.

30:50.460 --> 30:52.940
Okay.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.620
Okay.

31:02.260 --> 31:05.420
ommm.

31:05.500 --> 31:09.260
Oommm.

31:12.940 --> 31:15.420
Thankyou. Let's go.

31:31.620 --> 31:34.180
Oh, look.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.980
Have a cup.

31:56.980 --> 32:00.060
I see a face.

32:00.140 --> 32:03.020
He's a very important man,
and I'm sure he will be...

32:07.180 --> 32:10.340
I feel a strong aura emanating...

32:10.420 --> 32:13.980
Okay, here's what we've got.
This should helpyou interpret it.

32:16.340 --> 32:19.380
No. No.

32:27.580 --> 32:31.620
You're a dancer, many lifetimes.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.660
Ballet. Not here, abroad.

32:39.180 --> 32:42.780
-Europe? Netherlands?
-Belgium.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.300
What? What? What is it?

33:04.620 --> 33:06.820
-Very nice.
-Thankyou.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.860
Enjoy the fair.
Thankyou.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.780
-What's thisplace?
-Noah and a couple offriends.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.620
Let's get our picture taken.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.660
-Whatareyoudoing?
-I thought it would be fun
to get our picture taken.

33:21.740 --> 33:24.100
No, you didn't!

33:27.820 --> 33:31.940
Oh, my God.
It'sjust like I saw it.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.820
This isn't an aura.
It's like an infection.

33:34.860 --> 33:37.740
Pestilence.
Look how it's spread overJo.

33:37.820 --> 33:42.060
Noah, these colors, or lack of,
ofsepia and black...

33:42.140 --> 33:43.980
This is the aura ofa Borgia,

33:44.060 --> 33:46.660
not a little girl.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.580
No!

34:01.420 --> 34:03.900
-Delia, wait!
-Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

34:10.739 --> 34:12.460
Come on!

35:25.620 --> 35:29.860
-Does anyone know
how the fii re started?
-No.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.780
-Know what a Kirlian photograph is?
-No.

35:32.820 --> 35:37.300
It photographs auras.
Jo was given...

35:37.380 --> 35:40.460
One ofthese photographs was taken
ofher and Delia at the psychic fair.

35:40.540 --> 35:42.500
I don't believe
in any ofthat stuff.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.460
What does that have
to do with the fii re?

35:44.500 --> 35:46.980
Even ifyou don't believe in that stuff,
there's other stuff.

35:47.060 --> 35:52.060
Like lying, accusations
about dual behavior.

35:52.140 --> 35:55.900
Delia behaves differently
in front ofother people
than she does in front ofus.

35:55.980 --> 35:59.140
You're notanswering my question.
Whatdoes this have to do with the fiire?

35:59.220 --> 36:02.340
What I'm trying to say is...

36:02.380 --> 36:05.340
Jo says that Delia...

36:05.420 --> 36:08.100
is a very powerful personality.

36:08.140 --> 36:11.980
Like "Carrie setting fii re
to the prom"...

36:12.060 --> 36:13.900
powerful?

36:15.060 --> 36:17.740
Karen,

36:17.820 --> 36:20.620
would you give me
a major break here?

36:20.700 --> 36:22.620
Shame onyou
forbuying into thatcrap...

36:22.700 --> 36:24.780
andletting othersjudge
the childyouhave.

36:24.860 --> 36:26.780
Whatis thematter
withyour vision?

36:26.860 --> 36:29.860
Tsk. Anyway, I'm committed
to havingJo stay.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.900
She's determined to get through
to Delia, and I want her to try again.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.820
I understand the guys
have patched things up.

36:35.900 --> 36:39.740
Yeah. Thank God.
Jake flew up to meet him.

36:39.820 --> 36:42.940
Hejustgotcarriedaway
with having a friendin ahighplace.

36:43.020 --> 36:46.020
He helpedput Gene there.

36:46.100 --> 36:49.500
Areyou talking about Daddy?

36:49.580 --> 36:52.420
My daddy's going to be president.

37:00.540 --> 37:02.540
No, Iorderedthered.
Iorderedthered.

37:02.620 --> 37:06.020
Areyou sure there's enough seating
for 200? Watch out for the ferns!

37:06.100 --> 37:10.220
Go. Delia's alone.
This is a chance for us to talk.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.580
-Just pack up and come with me.
-I can't, Noah.

37:13.660 --> 37:16.420
You have the photograph.
You're sharing her aura.

37:16.460 --> 37:20.100
Everything she touches turns to illness.
The tone below illness is death!

37:20.140 --> 37:23.420
For heaven's sake,
she'sjust a little girl.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.780
What wereyou doing?

37:31.820 --> 37:33.900
Meditating.

37:33.980 --> 37:36.700
Asking for guidance.

37:36.780 --> 37:39.260
I just want to helpyou, Delia.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.980
-Ifyou'll just help me to understand.
-What?

37:44.180 --> 37:46.740
About what happened
at the psychic fair...

37:46.820 --> 37:49.300
and other things.

37:49.380 --> 37:52.460
About the trouble with the kids
at school, starting with kindergarten.

37:52.540 --> 37:54.820
I know theywere
unkind toyou there.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.820
Yes.Jerome teased me.

37:58.860 --> 38:02.380
He stuck gum in my hair,
kicked in my lunch pail. He hit me.

38:02.460 --> 38:05.220
Is that whyyou hurt him?

38:05.260 --> 38:10.020
I didn't hurt him.
He was a sissy.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.900
And then his fatherwas killed
in that terrible accident.

38:16.980 --> 38:22.140
-How did you feel about that?
-I don't know.

38:24.460 --> 38:26.820
In my bathroom, the cross?

38:26.860 --> 38:29.060
Upside down?

38:29.140 --> 38:33.540
-Doyouknow what thatmeans?
-Yes.

38:33.580 --> 38:36.220
-Who taught that toyou?
-My father.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.980
Your father taughtyou that?

38:40.340 --> 38:42.820
My father... is your father.

38:42.900 --> 38:46.540
I don't... I don't understand.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.380
What's the matterwith you?

38:51.820 --> 38:56.140
Why did you do that?
What evil madeyou do that?

39:26.420 --> 39:30.780
Mrs. York! Mrs. York! Mrs. York!

39:30.860 --> 39:34.540
Mrs. York!

39:34.620 --> 39:39.300
Mrs. York! Mrs. York!

40:21.740 --> 40:26.020
Jo! Jo dead. Dead.

40:26.100 --> 40:29.100
Relax, relax, Karen.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.460
Relax.Just let go.

40:31.540 --> 40:35.180
Let go. That's right.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.260
That's right. Good.

40:44.940 --> 40:48.100
Sorry. She's, uh...
She's okay.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.340
What, Lou?

40:53.140 --> 40:57.620
I think Karen may be pregnant.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.420
What?

41:12.060 --> 41:13.900
We've sedated her.

41:24.980 --> 41:28.420
-He toldus ifwe stopped
tryingyoumightgetpregnant.
-Iknow, but...

41:28.460 --> 41:32.220
But what? We were both tested,
and there was nothing wrong.

41:32.300 --> 41:35.980
There was a 50-50 chance
you'd get pregnant, and you did.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.300
-Now, be happy.
-I am happy.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.580
I'm just not going
to let anything happen.

41:40.660 --> 41:43.380
-What could happen?
-I don't know.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.700
-I gotta go. Have a good one.
-Bye.

41:45.740 --> 41:47.780
Have a good day.

42:22.220 --> 42:24.620
Mrs. York!

42:45.020 --> 42:46.900
Youshould've seenherface.

42:46.940 --> 42:49.980
She doesn't want me
to have this baby.

42:50.060 --> 42:53.380
Karen, come on. How can you say
something like that?

42:53.460 --> 42:56.980
She wouldn't try to hurtyou.
You said yourself, it'sjust a game.

42:57.060 --> 43:01.340
Childrenjust don't know
when to stop.

43:01.380 --> 43:04.020
I thinkyou'rejust...
I thinkyou're nervous...

43:04.060 --> 43:08.380
Oh, that's gonna be an umbrella excuse
forwhatever I'm feeling
over the next fiive months.

43:08.460 --> 43:11.700
Icanseeitcoming.
Gene!

43:11.740 --> 43:14.860
Our daughter isn't sacrosanct.

43:14.940 --> 43:17.660
Every time her odd behavior
is mentioned, you get defensive.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.620
Herbehavioris notodd.
Lou toldyou.

43:19.700 --> 43:22.980
When childrennolongerfeelthe center
ofattention, they do outrageous things.

43:23.060 --> 43:25.500
That's what happened.

43:25.580 --> 43:28.580
I had a serious talkwith her.

43:28.660 --> 43:31.220
She promised
she wouldn't do it again.

43:31.260 --> 43:35.900
There's all kinds ofthings.
Jo's Book ofLight.

43:35.980 --> 43:40.020
She flashed it at me at the window
like she wanted me to see it.

43:40.060 --> 43:44.340
Ifounditin thebushes.
Parts are underlined, making
references to Biblepassages.

43:44.380 --> 43:47.580
In it was aphotograph
ofJoandDelia at thepsychic fair.

43:47.620 --> 43:50.140
-Karen...
-It was a Kirlian photograph.

43:50.220 --> 43:52.180
Gene, pleaselisten tome!

43:52.220 --> 43:54.940
I talkedto theman who tookit.
He was a friendofJo's.

43:55.020 --> 43:57.860
-Itphotographs auras.
-Honey, come on!

43:57.940 --> 44:01.180
Don'tyou think it's odd our daughter
has never had any childhood illnesses?

44:01.220 --> 44:04.580
Not necessarily. She obviously
has a strong immune system.

44:04.660 --> 44:07.700
Strong immune system.
Friends, friends.

44:07.740 --> 44:11.060
She has no friends.
Don'tyou think that's odd?

44:12.740 --> 44:15.340
Yes, I know that's odd,
but I didn't have any friends too.

44:15.420 --> 44:19.020
I was an only child,
and I turned out okay.

44:19.100 --> 44:20.980
Karen, look.

44:22.860 --> 44:25.780
I'll keep my eyes open.
I'll be on the lookout.

44:25.820 --> 44:31.300
Iflseeanythingstrange,
anything atall, I'll deal with it.

44:33.140 --> 44:35.860
We'll deal with it together?

44:37.780 --> 44:39.620
Us.

44:41.340 --> 44:43.220
Come on.

44:53.860 --> 44:55.740
Delia?

44:55.780 --> 44:58.620
Come on! Time togo.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.300
Doctor says, "You're pregnant".
She says, "I want a second opinion".

45:08.380 --> 45:12.100
He says, "Okay, you're ugly".

45:14.100 --> 45:17.820
One ofthe niceties I miss
about having dinner is saying grace.

45:17.860 --> 45:21.340
Delia, doyouremember
thatsimpleprayer...

45:21.420 --> 45:23.380
ofthanks I taughtyou?

45:23.420 --> 45:25.140
No.

45:25.180 --> 45:28.180
Sureyou do.
Thankyou, Lord,

45:28.260 --> 45:30.740
-for Thybountifulgifts...
-I don't remember it!

45:34.380 --> 45:37.940
Audible prayers can
sometimes be embarrassing.

45:37.980 --> 45:42.620
-Let's voteagainstit, huh?
-Not everything is up for a vote, Gene.

46:02.420 --> 46:04.220
h, youmustbe Mrs. York.

46:04.260 --> 46:08.020
-Hello. Father Mattson?
-Yes. How doyou do? Congratulations.

46:08.060 --> 46:09.940
Thankyou. I'm six months.

46:09.980 --> 46:11.860
Father, I need your advice.

46:11.900 --> 46:14.180
I want to know ifyou're familiar
with this New Age book.

46:14.260 --> 46:17.300
-Please, let's go inside.
-Thankyou.

46:19.260 --> 46:21.780
There are severalBible
references in this book.

46:21.820 --> 46:25.180
-One is from Revelations. Right here.
-Ah, yes.

46:25.260 --> 46:29.500
"And he stood on the sand
ofthe seashore..."

46:29.580 --> 46:33.220
Where is it? "And I saw a beast
coming up out ofthe sea,

46:33.300 --> 46:35.500
having ten horns and seven heads.

46:35.580 --> 46:37.500
And on his horns were ten diadems.

46:37.580 --> 46:41.180
And on his heads
were blasphemous names".

46:41.260 --> 46:44.980
The Book of Revelations
will be argued until the Apocalypse.

46:45.020 --> 46:46.420
Please.

46:46.460 --> 46:50.900
But we believe thebeast
tobe theAntichrist.

46:50.980 --> 46:53.460
In God's eyes,
that's exactlywhat he is: a beast.

46:53.500 --> 46:58.980
The tenhorns are a confederation
oftennations.

46:59.060 --> 47:02.340
The seven heads are the seven leaders
who will give him their allegiance.

47:02.420 --> 47:05.460
They form an alliance
with the Antichrist.

47:05.500 --> 47:09.060
So, it's about politics?

47:09.140 --> 47:11.220
There's nothing that isn't politics,
Mrs. York.

47:12.860 --> 47:15.220
Lookaroundus.

47:15.300 --> 47:19.220
We're ushering in the Antichrist
to a world ofoverpopulation,

47:19.300 --> 47:22.060
pollution, crime.

47:22.140 --> 47:24.980
Our hell is his paradise.

47:25.060 --> 47:27.900
We brought this on ourselves?
We helped usher him in?

47:27.940 --> 47:30.780
This is crazy.

47:30.820 --> 47:34.260
We'rejustspeaking
fiigurativelyhere, right?

47:34.300 --> 47:38.100
Whatever makes you comfortable.
But, yes, we are ushering him in.

47:38.180 --> 47:40.820
That part ofus that is the worst ofus,
is what gives him his power.

47:40.860 --> 47:43.740
You're saying we're all
in league with the devil?

47:43.820 --> 47:47.580
Most ofus unknowingly, ofcourse,
but there are others.

47:47.620 --> 47:50.260
What doyou mean?
What others?

47:50.340 --> 47:54.620
Leaders who plunder the treasuries
oftheir poor countries,

47:54.660 --> 47:59.100
trashing their own people, driving them
into famine, hopelessness, disease.

47:59.180 --> 48:02.940
Men whopave overforests
thatprovide the veryair we breathe.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.940
These are the true apostates,
the ones laying out...

48:05.980 --> 48:08.180
the red carpet for the Antichrist.

48:08.220 --> 48:10.460
You do believe
the Antichrist will come?

48:10.500 --> 48:13.620
Yes, I do.

48:13.700 --> 48:16.380
" Uttering haughty
and blasphemous words,

48:16.460 --> 48:19.740
and allowed to exercise authority
for 42 months".

48:19.820 --> 48:21.500
That's all it'll take?

48:21.580 --> 48:24.620
A politician can do
a lot ofharm in 42 months.

48:25.820 --> 48:29.980
This man will be a terrible,
charismatic liar.

48:30.060 --> 48:33.820
Millions are gonnabelieve
in his one world, onereligion.

48:33.860 --> 48:37.820
Doyou think
he can be stopped?

48:37.900 --> 48:40.500
I'd pack it in ifl didn't.

48:42.540 --> 48:45.180
We all do what we can, right?

48:45.260 --> 48:47.140
Yes, Father.

48:47.220 --> 48:49.980
Yes, we all do what we can.

49:08.940 --> 49:11.020
Hi, honey.
Is your mother home?

49:11.100 --> 49:13.820
She's across the street.

49:13.860 --> 49:16.980
Let me leaveyou something
foryour mother to read.

49:37.340 --> 49:40.980
Ladies, excuse me. I live
in this house. What happened?

49:41.060 --> 49:44.380
I only said hello.
We handed her a pamphlet.

49:44.460 --> 49:47.660
-You didn't scare her?
-With a smile?

49:47.740 --> 49:52.100
That little girl, the things she said!
I've never heard language like that!

49:52.180 --> 49:55.900
She tore up the pamphlet,
and then threatened us with your dog.

49:55.980 --> 50:00.020
Please,just wait here.
I'll getyou some money.

50:04.420 --> 50:07.980
-You get toyour room right now!
-Why? I didn't...

50:08.060 --> 50:10.500
Don't argue with me! Go!

50:18.820 --> 50:22.420
Delia? What happened?

50:22.500 --> 50:24.340
Theyscaredme.

50:24.420 --> 50:27.140
They said the world
was gonna end,

50:27.220 --> 50:31.380
and that I was a sinner
who was going to burn to death...

50:31.460 --> 50:33.660
unless I do what they say.

50:33.700 --> 50:37.340
That'sjust not true.

50:37.380 --> 50:39.740
Yes, it is.

50:39.820 --> 50:43.020
Those end-of-the-world zealots
have been around since I was a kid.

50:43.100 --> 50:46.860
They scared the hell out ofme.
I had nightmares for a week.

50:46.940 --> 50:49.980
-That's not what happened.
-Mommy,

50:50.020 --> 50:52.020
you weren't even there.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.380
You did it again.
You found an excuse.

51:11.460 --> 51:15.060
Way back in your childhood, you found
a corollarywith what happened today.

51:15.140 --> 51:17.100
She told us what happened.

51:17.180 --> 51:20.060
It never occurred toyou that she
might not be telling the truth?

51:20.140 --> 51:24.060
No, Karen,
it never occurred to me.

51:41.580 --> 51:44.660
I should guess you're
about eight months along.

51:44.740 --> 51:47.580
Oh, about eight months, two days,

51:47.660 --> 51:50.780
and 12 hours and 23 minutes.

51:50.860 --> 51:53.980
You have no idea what happened
to SisterYvonne?

51:54.060 --> 51:58.060
She chose a secular life.
That's all I can tell you.

51:58.140 --> 52:00.380
-No contact at all?
-None.

52:00.420 --> 52:02.300
Forwarding address?

52:02.340 --> 52:04.340
I don't think so.

52:04.420 --> 52:07.380
There's something wrong,
isn't there?

52:09.460 --> 52:12.860
I'll see ifl can fii nd some address
that might helpyou.

52:12.940 --> 52:15.100
Great.

52:20.260 --> 52:24.540
ReverendMother?

52:24.580 --> 52:27.100
Doyou think it's possible...

52:27.180 --> 52:30.460
for a child to be born evil?

52:30.500 --> 52:34.620
A child is not born evil.
It's the world it's born into...

52:34.700 --> 52:36.540
that's fiilledwith evil.

52:36.620 --> 52:39.060
-Butyou believe in original sin?
-Yes.

52:39.100 --> 52:42.220
But there are degrees ofsin.
To what degree it will be manifested...

52:42.300 --> 52:45.820
depends on how close
we come to God.

52:45.900 --> 52:48.020
Then the idea
ofan evil seed...

52:48.100 --> 52:50.180
God wouldn't create
something evil!

52:50.260 --> 52:52.780
Man does that for Him.

53:05.540 --> 53:09.140
Gene? Come help me!

53:19.100 --> 53:21.500
Gene!

53:23.140 --> 53:25.180
Gene!

53:25.220 --> 53:27.900
What's wrong?

53:27.940 --> 53:30.220
I can't get up.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.740
I feel like
the Goodyear blimp.

53:32.820 --> 53:35.540
Couldn't say "no"
to the ice cream, could you?

53:48.540 --> 53:52.700
He kidnappedhis kid.
Hejumpedbail, andsnatchedtheboy.

53:52.780 --> 53:55.660
Don'tgive me that. Thebastard
doesn'tgive a damnabouthis kid!

53:55.740 --> 53:58.060
He's holding theboyhostage.

53:58.140 --> 53:59.980
Youbet!

54:00.060 --> 54:03.620
And you tell your slimy client
that he's in bounty country now.

54:03.660 --> 54:07.260
Andl'm gonnabag him, fiielddress him,
slam him across thehoodofmy car...

54:07.340 --> 54:10.500
like a gutted moose, and drop him
on the steps ofthe countyjail!

54:12.140 --> 54:14.940
I'm partialto Chinese.
Charlie Chan's myhero.

54:15.020 --> 54:16.860
Ineversaw
apregnantlawyerbefore.

54:16.940 --> 54:20.900
You know courtrooms, you look away
for a second and... ahh!

54:20.940 --> 54:22.980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

54:23.060 --> 54:25.460
With a sense ofhumor. Hmm.

54:26.980 --> 54:28.940
My friend Forrey Riggs
told me aboutyou.

54:29.020 --> 54:33.980
Lawyer. Black. Very smart.
Wife's a teacher. Yeah, I remember.

54:34.060 --> 54:36.780
-I wentona dig forhim.
-He says you dig pretty good.

54:36.860 --> 54:39.940
Sit down.

54:39.980 --> 54:43.700
I'd likeyou to do
some investigative work for me.

54:43.780 --> 54:45.820
I play Paul Drake
toyour Perry Mason?

54:45.900 --> 54:48.540
No, I gave up my practice long ago.

54:48.620 --> 54:50.500
Huh.

54:52.540 --> 54:54.780
Congressman Resnick.

54:54.860 --> 54:56.940
Graham Resnick!

54:57.020 --> 54:59.420
Oh, yeah.
I enjoyed taking him down.

54:59.500 --> 55:02.220
-Yeah, my husband got hisjob.
-Iknow whoyouare.

55:02.300 --> 55:05.020
Your husband's pretty clean.
He's a good guy.

55:05.100 --> 55:07.740
Tell him to keep it that way.

55:07.820 --> 55:10.380
Why did you choose Resnick
as your target?

55:10.460 --> 55:13.420
Citizen's Action Committee contacted me.

55:13.500 --> 55:17.180
Huh. Could you tell me
who was on the committee?

55:19.060 --> 55:22.700
My fee is three hundred a day,
plus expenses.

55:22.780 --> 55:26.140
I wantyou to fii nd someone for me.

55:26.220 --> 55:28.460
Missing persons is most
ofmy business.

55:28.540 --> 55:31.620
The baby in this photograph
is our adopted daughter.

55:31.660 --> 55:35.620
I wantyou to fii nd her parents.
Theyoung novice is SisterYvonne.

55:35.660 --> 55:38.380
I have an address for her.
I'm not sure that it's good.

55:38.460 --> 55:42.100
This photograph was taken years ago
at St. Francis Orphanage.

55:44.300 --> 55:47.500
There's more.
There's so much more.

55:47.580 --> 55:51.220
There's arash ofthings
thathave happenedovertheyears.

55:51.300 --> 55:54.060
A Kirlianphotograph
that was takenbyapsychic. Noah.

55:54.140 --> 55:55.980
I can getyou his last name.

55:56.060 --> 55:58.180
It started with the baptism.

55:58.220 --> 56:02.140
There was a terrible accident
with Father Hayes. Then there wasJo.

56:02.220 --> 56:04.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:04.220 --> 56:06.260
Slowdown, slowdown.

56:06.340 --> 56:10.500
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry!

56:10.540 --> 56:14.900
-It's all right.
-It'sjust...

56:14.980 --> 56:19.700
It'sjust that so much has happened.
I'm fii ne, I'm fii ne.

56:21.980 --> 56:24.060
Come here. Come on.

56:40.900 --> 56:44.220

56:44.300 --> 56:47.300
-Theypavedthe way foryourhusband.
-Huh.

56:48.460 --> 56:50.300
Smell a rat?

56:50.380 --> 56:52.660
Yeah.

56:52.740 --> 56:54.940
Hell ofa world, huh?

56:55.020 --> 56:57.020
Yeah. It's a hell ofa world.

56:57.100 --> 57:01.060
Ihave toldyouall Ican, Mr. Knight.

57:01.100 --> 57:04.980
The law prevents me from giving you
the names of Delia's biological parents.

57:05.060 --> 57:10.340
Mrs. York already toldyou they were
ayoung couple at the university...

57:10.380 --> 57:12.460
who got careless.

57:16.740 --> 57:20.540
Reverend Mother,
did we order two clowns to perform?

57:20.620 --> 57:22.580
Ofcourse not!

57:30.980 --> 57:32.860
What in Lord's name?

57:32.940 --> 57:36.060
Excusemeamoment, Mr. Knight.

57:57.100 --> 58:00.140
It's beautiful, honey.
Karen, lookat this.

58:00.220 --> 58:02.620
She drew the family trees
ofour founding fathers.

58:02.700 --> 58:05.540
Never known a child
so interested in politics.

58:08.380 --> 58:12.060
-May I be excused?
-Mm-hmm.

58:12.140 --> 58:15.260
It's beautiful, honey.

Excuse me, excuse me.
Haveyou seen this young woman?

59:41.180 --> 59:44.220
Yeah, she used to come in here.
Don't look like that anymore, though.

59:44.300 --> 59:46.180
We all get older.

59:46.260 --> 59:48.780
-Drinkin'andturning tricks don'thelp.
-Where is she now?

59:48.860 --> 59:52.020
-What areyou, a cop?
-Was.

59:52.100 --> 59:55.340
"Was" don't cut it, pal.
Only birdies sing for free.

59:55.420 --> 59:57.420
What does 20 bucks get me? Vanna?

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.300
-A vowel. Maybe a consonant.
-Oh.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.500
He's a tough guy.

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.220
Hereyou go.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.500
Pimp's name is Misha Russkie.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.780
Uh-huh. First McDonald's,
now pimping. They learn fast.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.860
Uh-uh.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.500
He'll be in after dark.
Pop in around 9:00.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.380
I gotta keep track ofmy expenses.
Give me a blank receipt.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.980
I'll fii ll it in later.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.540
A dishonest cop.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.020
Ex. Ex.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.460

-Going straight to hell, pal.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.420
Oh, yeah.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.780
Straight to hell.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.980
She was no good for me. Nyet.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:04.140
She starts for to preaching
to her tricks. Bad for business.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.620
Eh, I had to dump her.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.780
She got religion again, huh?

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.940
No, she starts for to hearing voices.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.780
Becomes a prophet.
Calls herself Felicity.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:20.620
Now she has a cult
in North Carolina.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.820
I don't know where.
But, I'll tell you this.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.780
She does better than me now.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.460
Eh! Okay.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.420
Just tell me what this means.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.700
All right, all right.
Theyoung couple existed.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.740
But they're not
your daughter's parents.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.300
They both died in the 1930s.
They didn't even know each other.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.820
-What?
-You've got SisterYvonne,
a nun who became a hooker.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.740
And now some kind

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.140

I tracked her down...

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.740

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.300
Disappeared afterJo's death.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.260
Something must have scared
the hell out ofhim.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.260
Mrs. York!

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.660

Don't be silly.
Let's giveyou a healthy baby.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.620

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.340
Why?

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:23.500

I'm so sorry.

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.100
Your brother died

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.700
-What?
-I couldn't believe it.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.620

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.740
Your brother at
the construction site.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:06.220

He's with Lisa.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.300

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.340
Did you know
that SisterYvonne died?

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.260
You're kidding?

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.260

It's called coincidence.

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.740

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.340
I'm gonna run some errands.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.100
On the phone.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.580
Sorry. Didn't mean to keepyou waiting.

01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:42.060
Let's go somewhere
more quiet, shall we?

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:49.780
And somewhere, I think it's in Daniel,
it talks about the fourth kingdom.

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.700
Hmm.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.300
What is there about the fourth kingdom
that frightens you so much?

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.620
Here it is.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.980
"Thus he spoke.

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:07.540
As for the fourth beast, there shall be
a fourth kingdom here on Earth,

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.980
and it shall be different
from all the kingdoms...

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:14.220
and it shall devour
the whole Earth".

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:19.020
-This fourth kingdom is where
the Antichrist comes from.
-Yeah.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.420
-Does he have to be born there?
-No, not necessarily.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.620
-Where is the fourth kingdom?
-Rome.

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.580
Rome.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.980
Rome. He said, "Travelto Rome".

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.740
So...

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:37.580
-So, it could mean, " Educated in Rome".
-Yes.

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:43.060
Father, the Antichrist
is always spoken ofas a "he".

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:48.660
The Bible didn't mean to be sexist.
Mankind can also mean womankind.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.180
Womankind. Womankind.

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.900
Uh, Father, could I be left alone here
for a few minutes?

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.260
Oh, yes, ofcourse.

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.260
Hi.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.940
Well, Gene tells me

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:57.220
Yeah?

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.420
-I beg your pardon?
-Youknow, feeling icky.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:05.340
Aftera couple falsealarms
andthen fiinallyyoubecoming amother.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.220
Oh, my God!

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:16.100
I wantanswers.
It's allhere.

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.740
You're not mentioned,
but the pieces fiit. All about Delia.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.940
Her father. Who is Damien Thorn?
The diary says he's the Antichrist.

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.660
Yes, yes. It's true!

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.300
Damien. He's the whole, Karen.
Damien is the power!

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.580
Tell me about Delia.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.940
She's Damien's daughter.
She carried his seed.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.820
When did you know this?

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:42.500
We've always known. We've been waiting
ever since his death.

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:47.340
Whatis this fetuspapyraceous?
Whatis it?

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:51.100
Fetuspapyraceous.
Ah, it's one twin able to carry...

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.700
the embryo ofits twin inside
ifit's a female.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.860
Just waiting to be implanted.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.500
Alexander is Delia's twin.

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.660
She carried her twin inside her
until you removed it.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.300
When?

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.260
When I examined her,
after she fell off the horse.

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.140
You implanted it in me...

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.180
when you examined me
afterJo's death.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:17.380
You made me a surrogate
for Delia's brother, you son ofa bitch.

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.140
-Why Gene? Is Gene in on this too?
-Gene? No!

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:22.380
But we need him.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.180
He will become
a very important political fiigure.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.340
Ofcourse. Ofcourse.

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.500
It's allaboutpolitics, isn'tit?

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.460
Forty-two months
andit'llallbe over.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.740
Wrong, Karen.
It'll just be starting.

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.580
Jake Millican is in on this too.
What happened, Lou?

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.060
Did he get greedy?
Started thinking in the short term?

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:42.140
No, he's back
with the program now.

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.900
It's gonna be a new world.
Gene will usher in our king.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.420
One man. One religion.

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.340
That freakwill never rule...
'cause I'm gonna kill him!

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.180
Ofcourse.
You're one ofthem too.

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.300
No!

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:47.100
I want to see my son.

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:54.940
Yes, Mother. See him.
Really see him.
