He's a professional
football player.

[ Mac ] I'm not talking about
killing the guy. I'm talking
about going with a group...

00:07.341 --> 00:09.274
and intimidate him,
maybe break his arm.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.343
You can't break
Tom Brady's arm.
Yes, I can.

No more Super Bowls
for that pretty boy.

Listen. Let me tell you
something with absolute honesty
and concern for your well being.

kick your ass.

last night?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.392
Charlie.
The kid needs to start
paying attention.

Who is this?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.230
Well, can you get him
out of here? He stinks.

Oh, my-- Je-- Oh, my God.
He shit his pants, Dee.

know that.

the American Legion. Wake up!

Yo!
What's the matter?

00:49.583 --> 00:53.519

Well, poke him harder
in his ribs.

How could you let this
happen, Charlie?

What? It's not my fault.
The guy orders one drink,

01:45.206 --> 01:47.339

again the rest of the night.

about this booth? There's
piss and shit everywhere.

Plus, that guy was so old.

- Old people are gross.
- Tell you what.
I'll get the gasoline.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.784
We're not gonna burn it.
Come on, dude. You never
let me burn anything.

01:58.786 --> 02:03.388
- Maybe we should close
to fumigate or something.
- No, no. We can't do that.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.724
We can't let anybody
know that this happened.
We'll never live it down.

02:05.726 --> 02:09.828
Are we gonna serve drinks today?
I don't think the board of
health will be too keen on that.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.232
I'm sorry. Do you see
any representatives from
the board of health here?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.300
Let's clean up the mess
and act like it never happened.

02:15.302 --> 02:19.771
I'm not getting anywhere
near that booth.
Me neither.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.543
I can't believe you guys
are making me do this.

02:24.545 --> 02:28.213
I can't believe you left
a dead guy in the bar overnight.
So I guess we're even.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.650
Charlie, the E.M.T.
said he had a heart attack,
not Ebola.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.386
- Do you wanna do this?
- No.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.855
Then don't
question my methods.

02:36.857 --> 02:42.427
Whoa, Charlie! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Goddamn it.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.629
We need to isolate the area.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.732
You're just gonna spread
whatever parts of him
decomposed overnight.

- No.
- What, are you
a scientist, dude?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.971
A scientist?
That's, like, science talk.

What the hell is science talk?

That's me. Actually--

Actually, I'm the owner.
I could help her out now.

We own it together.
Not really.
What can I help you with?

03:06.287 --> 03:12.024
My name is Rebecca Keane. I was
notified that my grandfather
died here last night.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.859
Oh.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:13.861 --> 03:18.230
- That's really horrible.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

I, uh-- I just wanted to see
where he spent his last night.

03:25.439 --> 03:30.342
Hmm, that would be somewhere
in this vicinity over here.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.811
- Oh, God.
- Are you all right?

03:32.813 --> 03:37.482
Yeah, I'm okay.
I-- I really didn't know him
that well actually.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.953
But he didn't
have any other family,
so the police called me.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.721
Oh, that's so sad.
Yeah.

03:42.723 --> 03:47.326
I guess I was
a little curious, you know.
I mean, he's my grandfather.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.328
And I know nothing about him.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.731
Yeah. Well,
he was a great man.
Really?

Yeah. Yeah,
just a very warm and...

03:56.604 --> 03:58.670
gentle soul actually.

03:58.672 --> 04:04.810
So you knew him?
Yeah, I wouldn't actually say
that I knew him all that well.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.613
I knew him pretty well.

04:07.615 --> 04:11.016
Yeah, we got pretty close
near the end there.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.784
Wow, really?
I knew him too.

- He didn't know him
as well as I did though.
- Oh.

Well, listen, I should go.
I have to get back to work.
I just wanted to stop in.

Of course. Well,
listen, if you ever
wanna stop by, you know,

about your grandfather that

available as well.

blowing up my spot.

His family just abandoned him.

Could we think about
that for one second?

Why the hell would we want
to think about that?

- Really depressing, Dee.
- It just makes me think
about Pop-Pop is all.

Pop-Pop is an asshole,
Sweet Dee.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.745
And I'm placing my bets that
that girl's grandfather
is an asshole too.

abandon their parents
for no good reason.

to a nursing home?

all the time.

is looking... good.

to ask you a favor.

with me to see my grandfather?

until it's too late

go by yourself?

the phone, dude.

to think about me though
