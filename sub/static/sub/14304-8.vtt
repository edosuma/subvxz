( blowing fanfare )

00:50.051 --> 00:52.718
Ladies and gentlemen

00:52.720 --> 00:55.754
of the Butterfly-Johansen
annual picnic,

00:55.756 --> 00:57.523
lunch is served.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.691
( cheering )

00:59.693 --> 01:01.326
Food!

01:01.328 --> 01:04.396
You know, Lord Wildrew
is still single.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.999
Never too late
to start over, dearie.

01:07.001 --> 01:10.102
Yes, Aunt Etheria,
I heard you the first
hundred times.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.938
May I present
the first course?

01:12.940 --> 01:16.308
Check out this big girl
sitting at the grown-up table!

01:18.611 --> 01:21.613
I'm too old to be sitting
at this stupid kids' table.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.450
It's not stupid.
We get all the Mewni
corn we want.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.619
It's so good.
My man here knows
what I'm talking about.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.455
Right, hungry buddy?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.258
I mean, really,
sippy goblets.

01:35.895 --> 01:39.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the big deal?

01:39.533 --> 01:42.101
All the fun is happening
over there.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.608
( slurping loudly )

01:52.212 --> 01:54.446
Oh, it's starting to happen.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.747
What's starting
to happen?

01:55.749 --> 01:58.417
Grown-up stuff.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.385
( all talking at once )

02:00.387 --> 02:03.555
There's no need for
any of this, I just want--

02:03.557 --> 02:06.492
You Johansens
spoiled my appetite

02:06.494 --> 02:09.394
like you've spoiled
the Butterfly family tree.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.664
Let's put a stop to this.
Tut-tut.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.468
Your neck ruffles are choking
off the oxygen to your brain.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.637
- River!
- You... oh!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.672
Yes, of course, of course.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.274
( clears throat )
Now, now.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.176
There's no need for
all this back and forth

02:24.178 --> 02:25.777
about who's better
than who.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.413
We're all royalty,
as you know.

02:28.415 --> 02:31.283
There is a way we can
settle this petty dispute

02:31.285 --> 02:34.753
like the civilized
people we are.

02:34.755 --> 02:38.290
With flags!!

02:38.292 --> 02:40.192
Flag!

02:40.194 --> 02:41.260
Oh, dear.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.728
It's about time.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.265
I've been thinking
about this all year.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.470
Come on, Marco.
Let's play.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.971
All we have to do
is be the first

02:52.973 --> 02:55.674
to get this flag
up there.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.876
Oh, like
king of the hill.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.711
I rock at that game.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.280
Not that hill.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.484
- That hill.
- Oh.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.119
And the winner gets to
look down on everyone else

03:07.121 --> 03:09.321
for a whole year.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.290
I am so ready for this.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.892
- No way.
- Hey. That's my flag.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.527
You can have it back
after the match.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.462
but you won't be
playing Flags today.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.132
Why not? You played Flags
when you were my age.

03:20.134 --> 03:23.302
- I did a lot of things
you won't be doing.
- ( groans )

03:23.304 --> 03:25.904
I know it's boring to be
the oldest at the kids' table,

03:25.906 --> 03:29.541
but you're not ready
to be the youngest
at the adults' table.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.245
Now go and help your little
cousins chew their corn.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.514
I'll show her.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.250
I can play this game,
and I will win.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.485
Come on, Marco.
You're on Team Star.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.188
But you heard your mom.
We're supposed to stay
at the kids' table.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.756
Don't you worry.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.325
We'll be sitting at
the kids' table.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.860
The game will commence
when all participants

03:48.862 --> 03:51.063
are at the ready.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.266
So if both sides of
your family are playing
against each other,

03:54.268 --> 03:56.034
whose side are we on?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.569
Duh. Our side.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.739
Here's to another
spirited game of Flags.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.243
Let us not have a repeat
of last year's unfortunateness.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.677
What happened
last year?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.412
Just before he
reached the peak,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.781
Uncle Lump
got his body cut off.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.750
- What?!
- Relax. He's fine.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.585
He's right over there.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.787
Neigh, neigh.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.756
I think he likes it
better this way.

04:17.758 --> 04:21.293
Ready, set...
flags.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.664
Here we go, Marco.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.967
And both families
are at the course.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.402
The Johansens take
an early lead,

04:30.404 --> 04:32.037
but the Butterflies
are making up the slack.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.513
That's my girl.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.990
Star, little help.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.426
Oh, here, my dear boy.
Allow me to assist you.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.662
- Hey, thanks.
- Marco, no!

04:59.098 --> 05:02.801
By my troth, you must surely
ate it on that one.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.238
Smooch my royal
hindquarters.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.841
- Toodles!
- Nice takedown,
Uncle Heartrude.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.811
- Let go!
- You good?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.614
Why did you congratulate him?
He pulled me down.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.982
That's Flags.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.818
That's how you play.
We gotta keep moving.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.821
Prithee, may I accept
some assistance?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.823
Dream on,
Uncle Jerkface.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.292
Whoa sakes. I have
not the choice

05:27.294 --> 05:29.861
but to
gnaw off my own fibula.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.364
We're going into
the rain zone.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.599
( thunder rumbling )

05:34.601 --> 05:36.001
Oh, no.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.705
I can do king of the hill,
I can not do wet socks.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.274
Flags doesn't care
what you like.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.242
We gotta keep moving.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.945
Out of the way,
old lady.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.454
- Wait a minute.
- Eyes on the prize, Marco.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.755
( laughing )

05:59.625 --> 06:01.326
Star, we gotta
go back.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.894
We are never
going back.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.339
I think your family's really
trying to hurt each other.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.041
Yeah. Isn't it awesome?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.976
Not again, not again,
not again.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.911
And there's the repeat
of last year.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.081
Adieu, Uncle Lump.
Who shall take the hill?

06:23.083 --> 06:26.451
I am beside myself
with anticipation.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.057
Star.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.493
Look at my girl,
all grown up

06:34.495 --> 06:36.061
and playing Flags.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.764
You make me so proud.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.799
Aw, Dad, you're so sweet.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.269
Great job, honey.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.904
You just threw your...

06:45.906 --> 06:47.572
You got me.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.274
You just threw your...

06:49.276 --> 06:54.045
( muttering indistinctly )

06:54.047 --> 06:57.716
You just threw your dad
down a mountain.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.950
Haven't you figured
it out yet?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.786
You don't waste time
on anybody.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.421
Keep up.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.094
And the herd of participants
is being further culled.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.930
There is now only a handful
vying for the top of the hill.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.933
So dreadfully exciting.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.302
Lady Etheria and Lord Grunt
lead the pack

07:17.304 --> 07:20.105
with a late appearance from...
oh, my.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.040
The Princess Star Butterfly.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.708
What?

07:28.414 --> 07:30.148
Star?

07:53.773 --> 07:56.007
You've been a stone in
my poulaines for too long,

07:56.009 --> 07:58.810
my incorrigible little niece!

07:58.812 --> 08:01.246
You're about to
abdicate the throne!

08:08.421 --> 08:10.722
What is she doing?

08:15.528 --> 08:16.661
Marco, come on.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.630
Star, this game
is changing you.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.866
It's not about
who versus who

08:20.868 --> 08:22.634
or rivalries
or whatever.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.436
It's about winning
no matter what.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.204
And that's just
not you.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.110
Eat this.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.721
Let's just go back
down the hill.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.095
Star.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.872
She's got our flags.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.908
Get her!

09:04.544 --> 09:06.878
Get our flags.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.050
Give me flag.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.985
Give it to me!

09:28.935 --> 09:30.268
Mom?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.275
- Are you all right?
- Oh, man, Mom,

09:37.277 --> 09:39.377
those are
some sweet magic moves

09:39.379 --> 09:42.113
with your big old wings
and stuff.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.683
Star, you're never
going to believe,

09:44.685 --> 09:47.018
but I just met
your twin sister.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.120
She was made
out of corn.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.890
I don't even remember
giving birth to her.

09:51.892 --> 09:56.127
River, did I ever give birth
to a corn baby?

09:56.129 --> 09:58.964
No. I'm afraid
we just have the one
child, my dear.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.565
Thank you, River.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.467
The name is Star.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.303
Okay. Why don't you
just lay back down?
Thank you.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.771
You see what Flags
does to your brain?

10:06.773 --> 10:10.141
I'm sorry I tried to
trick you with my corn twin.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.210
And maybe you're right.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.079
Maybe I'm not
ready for Flags.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.281
But maybe the real problem
is that Flags is dumb.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.316
I found her.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.585
Star Butterfly.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.221
Our only child,
my dear.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.489
Okay.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.157
Hungry.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.560
I was trying to bring
all these flags

10:28.562 --> 10:30.161
to the top of the hill.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.597
Not so that I could
win the hill for myself,

10:32.599 --> 10:35.100
but to claim the hill
for all of us!

10:35.102 --> 10:37.168
( cheering )

10:37.170 --> 10:39.270
Who wants food?

10:39.272 --> 10:43.274
That's the most adult
thing I've heard all day.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.310
I misjudged you, Star.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.946
You earned a rightful seat
at the grown-up table.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.347
Hug!

10:49.349 --> 10:51.950
Star, public displays
of affection

10:51.952 --> 10:53.918
aren't a Butterfly virtue.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.854
The Johansens,
on the other hand,

10:55.856 --> 10:57.522
are amazing at it.

10:57.524 --> 11:01.259
You are the perfect blend
of both sides of the family.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.161
I'm proud of you.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.096
Thanks, Mom.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.998
Only an idiot would wanna
win this game.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.533
Whoo hoo!

11:08.535 --> 11:10.301
I'm the winner.
King of the hill.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.203
In your face.
Uh-uh-uh.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.610
Now, when you carry
the four,

11:18.612 --> 11:23.214
let V be the finite
dimensional vector
space over K.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.051
Where we're
solving for K...

11:26.053 --> 11:29.220
( loud sigh )

11:29.222 --> 11:30.655
( Skullnick continues )

11:30.657 --> 11:33.658
'Sup?

11:33.660 --> 11:37.228
For cosine localized
algebra, we write K.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.197
Blaah!

11:39.199 --> 11:44.335
( teacher continues
in monotone )

11:44.337 --> 11:45.770
Okay.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.076
Fly free, little Marisol!

11:54.046 --> 11:56.247
- ( yells )
- Oh, no.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.749
Be free!

11:57.751 --> 12:00.418
Why did you do that?

12:00.420 --> 12:03.388
Because she was bored!

12:03.390 --> 12:05.056
We're all bored!

12:05.058 --> 12:06.925
She's bored, he's bored,

12:06.927 --> 12:08.827
he's bored, Marco's
definitely bored.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.662
Don't drag me
into this.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.530
Bored out of his mind.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.932
That's it.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.266
- Detention.
- For that?

12:15.268 --> 12:18.269
Marco, go get my hamster.

12:18.271 --> 12:22.407
Viva Marisol!

12:22.409 --> 12:25.610
Oof!
( growls )

12:25.612 --> 12:28.646
Sit in there and think
about what you did, hooligan.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.852
'Sup, Star?
Welcome to D-ten.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.287
Looks like you're
one of us now.

12:39.258 --> 12:43.228
Math cage, hamster cage,
detention cage.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.929
You guys can stay
in here if you want,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.464
but I won't be caged.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.266
I'm outta here.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.768
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.704
I mean, you were elected
mayor of detention,

12:52.706 --> 12:54.806
- but whatever.
It's no big deal.
- What?

12:54.808 --> 12:59.277
Yeah. It says so right here
on this thing.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.079
This paper...
piece of paper.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.380
But I just got here.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.716
No, no, I get it.
It's cool.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.384
The mayor has
more important things to do.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.487
Uh, hey, everybody,
can I have your attention?

13:09.489 --> 13:12.223
Listen up.
I have some bad news.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.592
The mayor is busy and won't
be able to help us today,

13:14.594 --> 13:19.030
so I guess we'll just
go back to our previous
system of anarchy.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.934
( glass shatters )

13:22.936 --> 13:26.337
Let me see that.
Hey. This is fake.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.072
Every election is fake.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.941
What does the mayor
of detention even do?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.944
Well, the townspeople have
a list of requests.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.414
And the mayor, you,
fulfill them.

13:40.085 --> 13:41.986
Let's get this over with.

13:43.289 --> 13:44.522
Candy.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.358
Tattoo.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.195
And comb.

13:57.369 --> 14:01.539
Well, looks like
my work here is done.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.541
See you, guys.
Won't be needing this anymore.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.210
( crying )

14:07.646 --> 14:09.781
What's up with Waterworks
over there?

14:09.783 --> 14:12.784
Oh, that's Toby.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.185
Yeah, but why is he crying?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.720
Oh, he's just bummed

14:15.722 --> 14:17.856
'cause he didn't get
his request in on time.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.525
- Not your problem.
- Ugh. Okay.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.228
Fine. One last thing,
but then I'm gone.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.063
Toby, what's your request?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.564
Well, usually,

14:26.566 --> 14:29.701
we all gather around
this little window like so,

14:29.703 --> 14:33.471
and we watch wrestling
on the TV across the hall.

14:33.473 --> 14:37.542
I can control it
with this stolen remote.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.811
Except the batteries
are dead.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.813
Worst timing ever.

14:41.815 --> 14:45.650
The Junior Mustache
is fighting the Sterling
Stallion at 4:00 p.m.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.054
So where we gonna get
fresh batteries, Miss Mayor?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.390
Hmmm.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.459
- ( music playing )
- ( gasps )

14:56.395 --> 14:59.197
That's it. Oskar's
keytar uses batteries.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.632
I like your style.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.838
Come out, Marisol.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.540
- Here, baby.
- ( squeaking )

15:09.542 --> 15:12.076
Fine. I'm comin' in.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.751
Aw, come on.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.622
Huh?

15:26.025 --> 15:27.425
Oh, hey, Jackie.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.427
Do you need some help?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.297
Just hangin' out.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.132
I drew up a plan.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.567
We'll cross the field
to the parking lot,

15:36.569 --> 15:38.569
but we have to get back
by 1:00 p.m. sharp.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.272
That's when Skullnick
checks in every day
for roll call.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.642
The school ground's
a harsh, unforgiving landscape

15:44.644 --> 15:46.444
not to be taken lightly.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.514
( yelling )

15:51.650 --> 15:55.119
First, we gotta get past
the fall hall.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.792
Next, we must blend in
with band practice.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.564
And lastly,
Miss Skullnick.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.568
I got it.
Shimmering destructo cannon.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.974
How about we call that
Plan B?

16:15.976 --> 16:19.477
I was thinking we could
just scare her away
with this.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.346
Potato chips!

16:21.348 --> 16:23.314
I don't get it.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.584
Not chips.
This.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.787
Aw, he's so cute.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.557
( chewing loudly )

16:36.595 --> 16:39.497
Oh, when did I pack you?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.100
Sour cream and ham flavored?

16:42.102 --> 16:44.035
My favorite.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.671
Oooh, I better not.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.840
Oh, but what could
one chip hurt?

16:48.842 --> 16:51.509
Who are you kidding,
Margaret?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.044
You wouldn't just
stop at one.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.613
But you have been doing
your water aerobics every day,

16:55.615 --> 16:57.448
so you deserve this.

16:59.051 --> 17:02.620
What's going on here?

17:05.057 --> 17:07.658
( kids chattering,
cameras clicking )

17:07.660 --> 17:11.562
They better not be having
fun on school grounds.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.233
Don't worry. I have him
pretty much wrapped
around my finger.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.168
Let me do the talking.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.369
Hey there, Oskar.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.338
We'd like to borrow your...

17:20.340 --> 17:23.708
( Star shuddering )

17:26.645 --> 17:28.546
Uh, Madame Mayor.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.915
Batteries.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.583
( stammering )

17:32.585 --> 17:35.920
Mayor. Star!
Ugh, forget it.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.556
Hey, Oskar, can we borrow
your keytar batteries
to watch wrestling?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.659
There is no cause worthier
than the wrestling arts.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.765
Great. I'll just take
those batteries then.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.867
No, you can't have these.
I gotta keep jammin'.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.837
But I have a spare set
of batteries in the trunk.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.807
Somewhere in one of these.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.444
Batteries!

17:59.446 --> 18:00.778
Nailed it.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.715
I hope you didn't hurt
my sweet Marisol.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.417
No, I'm fine, thanks.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.885
Where's the stuck kid?

18:07.887 --> 18:10.621
- Ahem.
- It's probably him.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.724
Don't worry, little fella.
We'll get you out in no time.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.526
Wait. Wait, wait!

18:15.528 --> 18:17.061
Is this safe?

18:17.063 --> 18:18.763
Yeah, I'll be fine.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.134
- All free.
- Finally!

18:23.136 --> 18:26.003
Whoo, I don't have to look
like an idiot anymore...

18:28.307 --> 18:30.908
Marisol!

18:30.910 --> 18:33.444
My little Marisol.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.746
( smooching )

18:35.748 --> 18:37.715
It's almost time to
check on the degenerates.

18:37.717 --> 18:41.219
You wanna check on
the degenerates, Marisol?

18:41.221 --> 18:43.254
Yes, you do,
yes, you do.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.824
OSKAR: Oh, yeah, this bad boy
is one of my favorites.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.261
I got it near that library
that serves the best tacos.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.763
That is such a great story.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.733
( phone buzzing )

18:55.735 --> 18:59.504
- Mayor Butterfly,
it's almost 1:00.
- Ah!

18:59.506 --> 19:01.639
No, not this one.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.674
- No.
- Zilch.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.009
- Nope.
- Aha!

19:06.311 --> 19:07.612
Thanks, Oskar.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.946
No problem.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.150
( making keytar sounds )

19:14.753 --> 19:16.354
Get in.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.389
Porcupine beast
transformation!

19:30.102 --> 19:33.804
GIRL: Those girls are
so weird.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.175
Oh, my little Marisol.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.843
That cloud
looks like a tree.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.879
And that one looks
like... aaah!

19:41.881 --> 19:44.815
Oh, yeah, that one
does look like an aaaah!

19:44.817 --> 19:47.618
( kids screaming )

19:47.620 --> 19:48.719
( laughing )

19:48.721 --> 19:51.322
Skullnick.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.791
- Star.
- Radiant rainbow bridge!

20:11.710 --> 20:13.544
STAR: Made it.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.317
Oh, you must be
so hungry.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.820
Aren't you? How about
something to eat, huh?

20:25.190 --> 20:27.258
( anguished shriek )

20:34.099 --> 20:36.734
Has anyone seen
my Marisol?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.903
Oh, you mean this Marisol?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.339
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.775
Does this mean
we can leave detention?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.110
No!

20:54.853 --> 20:58.589
ANNOUNCER:  <i>This has been one</i>
<i>exciting Wrestle Rama,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

20:58.591 --> 21:00.358
<i>Looks like Junior Mustache</i>
<i>is getting ready</i>

21:00.360 --> 21:02.393
<i>to pull off his</i>
<i>Boom Boom of Doom.</i>

21:02.395 --> 21:04.929
<i>Oh! That looks like it hurt.</i>

21:04.931 --> 21:08.799
<i>One, two, three...</i>

21:08.801 --> 21:10.968
<i>ANNOUNCER: And he's out.</i>

21:10.970 --> 21:12.703
Well, duties fulfilled.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.938
You are free to go.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.973
Why, thank you.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.375
You, too.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.948
Get him, get him!

21:23.950 --> 21:26.884
ANNOUNCER:  <i>This has been</i>
<i>one exciting match, folks.</i>

21:26.886 --> 21:29.654
You know you don't have to
wear that badge anymore, right?

21:29.656 --> 21:33.858
I know, but if I take it off,
we wouldn't be matching!

21:35.994 --> 21:38.062
- Rip his head off!
- Tear him apart!
