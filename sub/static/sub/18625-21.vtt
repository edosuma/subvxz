[Jim] <i>Okay. We wait until he's asleep.</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:55.264
[Claire] <i>I use my Shadow Staff</i>
<i>to get us in.</i>

00:55.347 --> 00:58.892
[Jim] <i>And I ever so gently</i>

00:58.976 --> 01:01.603
[Toby] <i>Hold up there, Mr. Storyteller.</i>
<i>Do changelings even sleep?</i>

01:01.687 --> 01:02.896
[shouts, growls]

01:02.980 --> 01:05.022
[Jim] <i>Good point, Tobes. New plan.</i>

01:05.107 --> 01:08.902
<i>We spike his coffee</i>
<i>with extra strength cold medicine.</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:12.155
[Claire] <i>I use the Shadow Staff.</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:14.866
[Toby] <i>And I bring my Warhammer</i>

01:14.950 --> 01:17.828
-[Jim] <i>And I ever so gently...</i>
<i>-</i> [Claire] <i>Wait.</i>

01:17.911 --> 01:20.414
<i>What if he's not alone?</i>
<i>His office was guarded last time.</i>

01:20.497 --> 01:22.958
[laughs]

01:23.041 --> 01:25.961
[Jim] <i>Okay, fine. We spike the coffee.</i>

01:26.044 --> 01:27.045
[Claire] <i>Shadow Staff.</i>

01:27.129 --> 01:29.715
[Toby] <i>I use my Warhammer</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:33.135
[Jim] <i>Then, I ever so gently</i>
<i>remove the ring.</i>

01:33.218 --> 01:35.762
-[Toby] But what if it doesn't come off?
-Why would it not come off?

01:35.846 --> 01:38.598
[Toby] <i>I don't know. Maybe it's glued on,</i>
<i>or he added a few pounds.</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:40.392
Why would it be glued on, you dingus?

01:40.475 --> 01:42.144
[Toby] <i>You said be ready</i>
<i>for every precaution.</i>

01:42.227 --> 01:44.604
- He's waking up!
- Oh, how is he waking up?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.982
- This isn't even really happening!
- Cut off his hand!

01:47.065 --> 01:49.067
- What?
- Use your sword. Hurry! Do it!

01:49.151 --> 01:52.195
- No, I'm not gonna cut--
- Do it! Do it! Before it's too late!

01:53.488 --> 01:54.990
-[shouts]
-[Toby] Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:55.073 --> 01:58.327
If you chop his hand off, you chop
your mom's hand off too, remember?

01:58.410 --> 02:02.164
Oh, I forgot. Angor Rot's binding spell.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.541
We're not ready. There's too much risk.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.961
But Angor Rot said if you don't get
the ring, he's coming back for you.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.922
Hey, we'll figure this out, Jimbo.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.841
It's not like we don't have
a secret Trollmarket

02:12.924 --> 02:15.385
right under our feet
filled with crazy magic.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.597
You sure you don't wanna come?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.265
Sorry. Parents are on a weekend trip,

02:20.349 --> 02:22.643
so Mary and Darc are coming over
for girls' night.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.811
Just keeping up appearances.
You know what I mean.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.231
- Ooh, girls? I love a good pillow fight.
- Just ignore that.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.150
We'll let you know
if we find anything, okay?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.985
See ya.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.037
[blender whirring]

02:43.121 --> 02:47.584
- What are you doing out of your crib?
- Tryin' a new recipe. Wanna taste?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.464
Just 'cause my parents are gone

02:52.547 --> 02:54.800
doesn't give you free rein
to do whatever.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.052
I'm still your older sister,
you little troll!

02:57.135 --> 03:00.138
Technically, I'm a few centuries older,

03:00.222 --> 03:05.018
so I should be the one
babysittin' you, sponge face!

03:05.102 --> 03:06.853
I've had it with you.
[gasps]

03:06.937 --> 03:08.480
-[laughs]
-Fudgeknuckle!

03:08.563 --> 03:10.107
Ever since you replaced my brother,

03:10.190 --> 03:12.609
all I do is cover
for your awful existence!

03:12.692 --> 03:15.028
I'm the one who gets blamed
for everything!

03:15.112 --> 03:17.739
My dad wants me to see
a shrink for ordering $900

03:17.823 --> 03:19.366
worth of socks online!

03:19.449 --> 03:23.703
Could've been worse!
Used a promo code! Got free shipping!

03:23.787 --> 03:26.123
Ugh! You're the worst fake brother ever!

03:26.206 --> 03:28.875
Easy, sister. Did you forget?

03:28.959 --> 03:34.423
I'm the one puttin' my neck on the line,
siding with you guys over Gunmar.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.676
And for what? To be a crib rat?

03:37.759 --> 03:40.387
I used to be the life of the party!

03:40.470 --> 03:42.889
Now you're going back to your crib
'cause my friends are coming over.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.893
- [grunts] I told you. Not me scruff!
- It's naptime.

03:47.936 --> 03:52.941
And don't ever ask me to do the favor
of letting you see your brother again!

03:53.024 --> 03:56.611
Fine! I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.324
[grunting]

04:01.408 --> 04:04.161
Nobody picks me up by me scruff.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.663
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey. It's still on.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.041
- I don't care who knows. Invite 'em all.
- Got it.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.460
[laughs]

04:11.543 --> 04:13.211
[knocks]

04:15.046 --> 04:17.716
Excuse me. Mr. Rot and Gut?

04:17.798 --> 04:21.219
Do you guys have
a ring remover spell or anything?

04:21.303 --> 04:24.765
-[window opens]
-[Rot] You want a ring... remover?

04:24.848 --> 04:30.020
Hmm, let's see. Ring, ring...
Oh, here it is!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.814
That's Ringworm remover, ya glork.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.777
- What about a magical super magnet?
- [Gut] Oh! Definitely got one of those!

04:36.860 --> 04:39.863
Doesn't work great. Just grabs snails.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.115
I'm afraid our colleagues here
won't be of much use

04:42.199 --> 04:43.950
if you do not know
what you're looking for.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.162
We got a Footswapper.
You can take his feet.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.332
Magical solutions are a delicate matter.
You must be precise.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.043
-Find the exact tool for the job at hand.
-[Gut screams]

04:53.126 --> 04:58.340
- What did you do with our feet?
- Oh! Gut! I'm wiggling your toes.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.218
-[Rot laughs]
-So where do we find the right tool?

05:01.301 --> 05:05.347
I know just the place!
Are you ready, young wards,

05:05.430 --> 05:07.432
to embark with me
on the greatest adventure?

05:07.516 --> 05:10.060
Oh, yeah! Where? Where?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.687
The adventure of reading!

05:12.771 --> 05:17.484
Hours upon hours
of research awaits you. <i>Avante!</i>

05:18.777 --> 05:21.238
Well, we sure walked into that one.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.743
[Blinky] My brother spent centuries
curating our kind's most exotic collection

05:26.827 --> 05:30.997
of scrolls, tomes and texts.
If the answer is anywhere, it's here.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.708
- I didn't know you have a brother.
- Had a brother.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.378
Dictatious Maximus Galadrigal.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.213
These books are all
that I have left of him.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.633
- If he were here to see me now...
- [Jim] Blink, I didn't know that--

05:41.716 --> 05:45.303
- Uh, Aaarrrgghh!!!
- Uh-oh. Uh...

05:45.387 --> 05:49.182
Just leaving. Had things I was doing.

05:49.266 --> 05:53.019
Uh... Gotta go. Just leaving.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.855
- Hey, wingman. What's--
- Fine. Bye.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.608
Strange. I don't believe

05:58.692 --> 06:01.194
- I've ever seen him in my library.
- Let alone reading.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.281
You guys notice Aaarrrgghh!!!'s
been acting kinda weird lately?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.993
Aaarrrgghh!!! is a complex
and yet endearing troll, Tobias.

06:08.076 --> 06:13.206
Sometimes it's best to just
let him be. Let's get reading!

06:18.295 --> 06:19.129
[sighs]

06:19.212 --> 06:22.966
All right, done. Just relax
and enjoy your time with the girls.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.219

the subwoofers on this thing?

Look at you. Aren't you the big one?
[chuckles]

06:53.622 --> 06:56.207
Hey! Grog! Haven't seen you in a while.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.125
[gasps]

06:57.208 --> 06:59.753
Keep it movin'. Keep it movin'.
Got plenty of room.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.090
No! No way! You are not having a party!

07:04.174 --> 07:06.468
[laughs] By the looks of it, I am.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.137
-What time your friends comin' over?
-[gasps]

07:09.220 --> 07:12.265
Hey, girl! 'Sup?

07:12.349 --> 07:16.811
'Sup, Claire? Sorry we're late. Just swung
by Tremiti's for a large triple meat 'za.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.939
Extra carnivore. Your favorite.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.024
No! No, no, no! Don't come!

07:21.107 --> 07:23.318
Hey, get away from the window!

07:23.401 --> 07:25.779
<i>- Get out of here!</i>
- Claire? Who's over there?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.323
Nobody. We'll hang out another time.

- Claire?
<i>- I gotta go!</i>

07:33.286 --> 07:35.330
C-bomb just hung up on me.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.500
Let me out!

07:38.583 --> 07:40.710
- Don't eat that!
- Phone tasty.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.380
- Oh.
- [troll] Whatever.

07:43.463 --> 07:48.218
Book 26, nothing. This last one
was just a list of toe fungus.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.261
Fungi. Fungi! Whatever! I don't care!

07:50.345 --> 07:54.432
[groans] I'm still on book three.
Can't exactly read Trollish,

07:54.516 --> 07:56.726
so just been kinda
looking at the pictures.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.981
This is taking forever. Any luck, Blink?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.524
[snores, yawns]

08:02.607 --> 08:05.860
Excuse me. My zeal for the library
sciences seems to be waning.

08:05.944 --> 08:10.198
Since I only have two eyes,
reading makes them very tired, very fast.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.784
Dude, you awake? You look terrible.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.829
I can't conceive why. I've met
every one of my daily human needs,

08:15.912 --> 08:19.457
three meals a day, eight glasses
of water, eight minutes of sleep.

08:19.541 --> 08:23.294
Oh, Blinky,
it's eight hours of sleep! Not...

08:25.422 --> 08:27.549
And... then there were two.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.551
[groans]

08:31.094 --> 08:34.681
I don't know how many more books
I can read before my brain melts.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.183
I think this book's about reading books.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.230
Wait a sec. I think you found something.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.692
Whoa.

08:46.818 --> 08:52.490
"A draught of Elix-Lore allows thee
to consume knowledge

08:52.574 --> 08:54.534
at a voracious pace."

08:54.617 --> 08:56.953
Won't take Strickler's ring off,
but it could help speed things up.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.747
I wonder if Rot-Gut has any.

08:58.830 --> 08:59.914
[Jim laughs]

09:03.376 --> 09:05.086
Huh? Mm!

09:05.170 --> 09:08.923
See? Know what to look for and
you can find the exact tool for the job!

09:09.007 --> 09:12.761
Oh! Give me some of that yum yum juice.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.596

09:14.679 --> 09:16.806
Ah! [smacks lips]

09:16.890 --> 09:17.932
Okay.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.769
After a swig of this, we'll get through
these books in no time.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.270
Kinda minty.

09:22.353 --> 09:26.191
With notes of... mold. Oh...

09:26.274 --> 09:29.652
Toby, it says you're only supposed
to drink a drop of it.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.030
-You drank half the bottle!
-[gurgling]

09:32.113 --> 09:35.075
Hey, Jim. My insides
are gurgling real weird.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.703
But do you feel... hungry for knowledge?

09:38.787 --> 09:41.247
Actually, I feel like I'm gonna--

Mm-mm.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.812
Jim, am I wrong?
Or did words just fly into my mouth?

10:03.895 --> 10:07.148
- How do you feel?
- I feel as good as Grimbald

10:07.232 --> 10:09.400

at the Quibble of Quandary

10:09.484 --> 10:12.821
after besting a vicious Sloorbeast.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.531
Wait. What did I just say?

10:17.325 --> 10:21.121
Holy moly! You just...
devoured the entire book!

10:21.204 --> 10:25.625
Oh, man, Tobes, you're like a--
you're like a troll genius!

10:25.708 --> 10:27.252
Quick, eat another one!

Hello, Gnomes. Hold still here.
I gotcha. Here we go.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.997
What's that under your arm?
Looks pretty bad.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.625
Nothing! Shut up! What you see?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.710
That's not yours!

11:50.793 --> 11:52.211
Sorry.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.215
Geez. Who plarped in his Glug?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.509
[all grunting]

11:59.969 --> 12:01.304
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Oh, Glug!

12:04.140 --> 12:07.477
- I've never seen him like this.
- Give the big lug a break.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.812
Even he needs to blow off some steam.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.274
[all chant] Aaarrrgghh!!! Aaarrrgghh!!!
Aaarrrgghh!!! Aaarrrgghh!!!

12:13.358 --> 12:16.194
[belches loudly]

12:16.277 --> 12:18.947
-[all cheer]
-Oh, yeah!

12:19.030 --> 12:22.492
- Yeah!
- A lotta steam apparently.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.619
This is insane!

12:24.702 --> 12:27.705
Wahoo! Eh? Yahoo!

12:27.789 --> 12:29.374
-[NotEnrique laughs]
-Yeah!

12:29.457 --> 12:32.877
-Who's the Sultan of Swagger?
-[all cheer]

12:32.961 --> 12:37.173
The Dark Prince of Partypalooza?

12:38.758 --> 12:41.928
Let's crank this party up!

12:42.011 --> 12:44.138
[loud music plays]

12:48.434 --> 12:49.644
[groans]

12:49.727 --> 12:52.689
So, what do you do?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.942
Oh. The strong, silent type. I see.

12:56.025 --> 13:00.154
Say, what does a girl got to do
to get that mask off?

13:03.449 --> 13:06.661
She's having a party?
Why wouldn't she invite us?

13:06.744 --> 13:09.163
-Yeah. We're cool.
-Hmm!

13:15.336 --> 13:20.174
- Why is it snowing in my room?
- Is blizzard magic not okay?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.469
[screams]

13:24.595 --> 13:26.389
- She's weird.
- Yeah.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.349
[car beeps outside]

13:29.434 --> 13:31.561
Oh, no. Not them!

13:32.353 --> 13:34.939
Hey, ladies. What's going down?

13:35.023 --> 13:38.443
Throwing a rager and not telling us,
is what's going down!

13:38.526 --> 13:42.071
I don't get it, Claire.
I thought we were your BFF's.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.282
This little thing? This isn't a party.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.951
[trolls] Yahoo! Party!

13:47.035 --> 13:50.663
Claire, are those... college kids?

13:50.747 --> 13:53.374
Let us in! We can hang with upperclassmen!

13:53.458 --> 13:56.002
No, I can't. I'm not opening this door.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.295
[groans]

13:57.378 --> 14:00.173
- No! Don't!
- Come on.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.216
Fine! I'll find another way in.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.761
Wait. Mary. Are you crazy?

14:04.844 --> 14:09.515
- You should have invited us.
- No, no! Stop! Get off my house.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.100
[grunts]

14:14.562 --> 14:16.439
Pummelling hour!

14:17.440 --> 14:19.609
Yeah! Hi.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.614
-[all cheer]
-[laughs]

14:24.697 --> 14:25.698
Yes!

14:26.366 --> 14:27.200
Ugh.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.536
Was that the delivery guy with me socks?
We're almost outta snacks.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.746
Mary and Darci are here.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.583
Do you realize how busted we are?
Mary's gonna tell everyone!

14:35.666 --> 14:39.295
Great! This party's blowing up!

14:39.379 --> 14:42.090
No. She's got
30,000 dumb followers online.

14:42.173 --> 14:46.052
One pic of this, and we're talking
news vans, black helicopters,

14:46.135 --> 14:47.678
you on a dissection table.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.055
Ooh.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.934
That's right. Ooh!
Just fix this! Shut it down!

14:53.017 --> 14:56.604
- Aaarrrgghh!!! Not helping!
- I'm sorry.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.688
Yeah!

14:59.482 --> 15:01.067
[shattering]

15:04.654 --> 15:08.199
- Blinky, wake up. Wake up!
- [phone vibrates] <i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

15:08.282 --> 15:11.828
<i>I am Gun Robot.</i>
<i>Pick up your phone. Pick up.</i>

15:11.911 --> 15:16.541
Claire! I'm so glad you called.
You gotta come to Trollmarket. Toby is--

15:16.624 --> 15:20.086
No time, Jim. You need to come here.
NotEnrique's out of control!

15:20.169 --> 15:23.714
Out of control?
Toby is gorging on magic troll words

15:23.798 --> 15:25.508
and turning into some kind
of a knowledge god!

15:25.591 --> 15:28.094
- [Toby] More! More knowledge!
- Toby, stop!

15:28.177 --> 15:30.138
More! More knowledge!

15:30.221 --> 15:34.434
Jim! NotEnrique, my house!
I've tried everything!

15:34.517 --> 15:35.935
More knowledge!

15:36.018 --> 15:38.896
Claire, look,
I know you can figure it out.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.398
<i>I'm so sorry but--</i>

15:40.481 --> 15:41.816
I gotta go!

15:41.899 --> 15:45.778
Okay. Maybe we should take a break, Tobes.
You gotta be full by now, right?

15:45.862 --> 15:51.868
No, James. I am becoming a living archive.
A codex of all troll history and arcana!

15:51.951 --> 15:56.456
I am like Voltar the Voracious,
who was born with two minds!

15:56.539 --> 16:00.668
For all good that did him.
Stepped on by a Thrall.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.545
[laughs]

16:03.212 --> 16:07.633
Don't you see, James? I already
have the solution to our problem!

16:07.717 --> 16:12.263
To do something impossible,
you must change what is possible.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.933
The oldest known troll
was 5,352 years old named Chokeenamaga.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.852
Okay.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.314
So, Tobes,
how do we get the ring off Strickler?

16:21.397 --> 16:25.651
The Kairosect will grant us
all we need to get the Inferna Copula.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.861
<i>Queethokpharlock.</i>

16:26.944 --> 16:30.031
Hey, hey, focus.
How do we get the Kairo thing?

16:30.114 --> 16:32.909
You must return to Gatto's Keep.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.662
Gatto? Oh, great!
Aren't you already on his crap list?

16:36.746 --> 16:40.791
<i>Bula-nok-chura-azu-zoth. Bula! Bula!</i>

16:40.875 --> 16:45.505
<i>- Bula-chura! Bula-chura! Bula-chura!</i>
- Oh, no!

16:45.588 --> 16:48.758
<i>Bula-chura! Bula-chura!</i>

16:48.841 --> 16:50.801
[laughs]

16:52.345 --> 16:55.640
<i>Bula-chura! Bula-chura!</i>
<i>Bula-chura! Bula-chura!</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:02.939
All right, Tobes. We got what
we're looking for, so let's chill, okay?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.441
We'll get some fresh air. Splash of water.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.236
There are more important endeavors!

17:08.319 --> 17:11.656
[voice distorted] I must know all!

17:12.656 --> 17:13.657
Oh, boy.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.452
[camera shutter clicking]

17:17.828 --> 17:22.666
Oh, hey, Claire. What's your wi-fi?
And why is the floor all wet? Ew!

17:22.750 --> 17:24.460
[sighs] Wait.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.714
Where... is... Mary?

17:28.798 --> 17:33.844
Yeah, this party is pretty crispy.
So... where are you from?

17:33.928 --> 17:37.723
- [troll] Underground.
- Love the underground scene.

17:37.807 --> 17:42.728
- So, are you like a... art major?
- What is art?

17:42.812 --> 17:46.732
Wow. That is so deep.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.068
We should do something sometime.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.822
- [groans] What are you doing?
- Mary. Come with me. Now.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.200
No! Call me.
[groans] Come on!

17:56.284 --> 17:57.827

18:03.499 --> 18:04.750
[shouts]

18:04.834 --> 18:09.297
The great Warg age
enters the seventh blood moon.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.800
The Draknagoth will arise!

18:12.883 --> 18:13.801
[loud gurgling]

18:13.884 --> 18:16.512
[heaves, burps]

18:16.596 --> 18:18.306
Nope.

18:18.389 --> 18:24.520
The parallels of the universe!
All its answers have become so clear!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.064
The secret to life is--
[gurgles]

18:27.148 --> 18:28.941
Nope. Nope. Nope.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.944
The secret of life is--

18:36.073 --> 18:39.118
The meaning is... Nope.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.996
The secret of life is... is...

18:42.079 --> 18:44.081
I think I'm-- Nope. I think I'm--

18:44.165 --> 18:46.292
Ugh.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.544
All right, Tobes.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.379
[vomits]

18:52.923 --> 18:53.924
The meaning is...

18:56.552 --> 18:59.096
[groans, sniffs] Ah!

18:59.180 --> 19:00.181
Elix-Lore.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.601
Tobes, Tobes.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.102
[burps]

19:06.103 --> 19:07.104
What is two plus two?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.985
Awesome sauce!

19:13.069 --> 19:15.946
Phew. Back to normal.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.782
But my library, on the other hand...

19:17.865 --> 19:21.118
Sorry. I'll-- clean it up.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.787
No. No, it's all recoverable.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.790
Rot-Gut's probably has
a little something to put it right.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.707
No!

19:27.708 --> 19:31.087
What are you doing?
The boy of my dreams was in--

19:31.170 --> 19:34.131
- Why is the floor all wet?
- It was just shampooed.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.635
- You need to leave... like, yesterday.
- Claire, what happened to us?

19:37.718 --> 19:41.639
We used to be inseparable.
And now, we barely see you.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.225
You're hanging
with your boyfriend, Jimmy Jam.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.935
He's not my boyfriend.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.896
But are we even your girlfriends anymore?

19:48.979 --> 19:52.483
Yes. But, this other life, you just can't.

19:52.566 --> 19:56.028
- Wait! I know what's going on.
- You do?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.239
You have a college boo!

19:58.322 --> 20:01.617
And you're keeping it secret
to spare Jim's feelings.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.743
Um...

20:02.827 --> 20:06.122
Oh! Hugs. Come here. Bring it in.

20:07.164 --> 20:11.043
Sorry about the drama!
But I gotta see this piece on the side!

20:11.127 --> 20:13.379
-[Mary giggles]
-Mary! No, no! Stop!

20:13.462 --> 20:14.380
[siren outside]

20:14.463 --> 20:15.881
[man] <i>Attention!</i>

20:15.965 --> 20:18.968
<i>This is the police!</i>

20:19.051 --> 20:21.971

<i>an awesome party in there!</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:24.890
<i>Disperse immediately!</i>

20:24.974 --> 20:26.767
-[all shouting]
-[siren wails]

20:29.437 --> 20:30.479
Quick! Out the window!

20:30.563 --> 20:32.648
- They won't see you!
- But what about you?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.650
Your parents will kill you
when they find out!

20:34.734 --> 20:39.864
I'll take the fall. It was my party.
But go. Save yourselves.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.783
Oh! Tell that artist boy to call me!

20:42.867 --> 20:45.911
Claire, you're the best. Talk tomorrow.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.209
<i>Open up!</i>

20:55.921 --> 21:00.342
You are under arrest
for falling for that.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.761
[laughs]

21:01.844 --> 21:04.805
You little brat. I could kiss you.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.892
Gross! Come on! I'm your brother.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.729
- Fake brother.
- Deserved that.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.731
Sorry.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.776
Maybe I shouldn't have had
a party. [sighs]

21:16.859 --> 21:20.446
Any time you wanna see your brother,
you know, just ask.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.450
And I'm sorry for always grabbing you
by the scruff.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.453
Maybe I can take you to Trollmarket
once in a while.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.246
[yawns]

21:29.330 --> 21:32.708
Now that we've made up,
I should be hittin' the sack.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.752
Don't want to stop you
from cleanin' up here.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.798
- I'm cleaning up?
- Really, the scruff again?

21:38.881 --> 21:40.633
- You better...
- All right, all right, all right.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.510
Truce. Truce!

21:43.594 --> 21:48.599
You go to sleep.
I'll clean up the mess.

21:49.225 --> 21:54.104
From what I heard,
siblings fight all the time. Right, sis?

21:54.188 --> 21:57.942
I guess that practically
makes us family.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.319
I guess it does.
