ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT

00:41.867 --> 00:44.667
-BEING A COP IN THE 21ST CENTURY
IS QUITE DIFFERENT

00:44.767 --> 00:47.100
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BEFORE.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.867
YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.700
AS LAW ENFORCEMENT,
YOU HAVE TO BE PEOPLE'S PASTORS,

00:52.800 --> 00:54.967
YOU HAVE TO BE
THEIR GUIDANCE COUNSELORS,

00:55.067 --> 00:58.200
BEST FRIEND,
YOU KNOW, A SHOULDER TO CRY ON,

00:58.300 --> 01:01.667

DEPUTY RAYMOND.

01:04.433 --> 01:07.400
GOT A STOLEN VEHICLE
OCCUPIED THREE TIMES.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.800
-WRECKED, I GUESS.

-Woman: (over radio)
CAR IS AT 1810 FARAWAY.

01:12.067 --> 01:15.400
THEY ARE ALL ON FOOT.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.167
-WHERE ARE "THEY"?

01:17.267 --> 01:19.200
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT TO GO
PERIMETER, THOUGH.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.467
-WHICH WAY THEY RUN?
-SOME OF THEM THAT WAY.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.200
WE JUST GOT TO GET GEORGE ON IT.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.267
-ALL RIGHT.
I'LL HEAD IT BACK THAT WAY.

01:30.067 --> 01:32.133
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:32.233 --> 01:34.500
-FARAWAY.
-(radio beeps)

01:34.600 --> 01:36.900
DEPUTY RAYMOND
APPARENTLY SPOTTED HIM.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.267
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM
RIGHT NOW.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.567
SAID HE'S ON CRESTVIEW,
RUNNING TOWARDS FARAWAY.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.667
(radio beeps)

01:42.767 --> 01:46.067
OR HUNKERED DOWN
IN SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD.

01:50.167 --> 01:53.067
THERE'S ONE ON CRESTVIEW.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.200
IS THAT THE ONE SHE GOT?

01:58.300 --> 02:00.367
-WHERE ARE THEY?
-THIS ONE.

02:00.467 --> 02:02.800
-ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT THIS ONE HERE!

02:10.133 --> 02:11.600
YEAH, GOOD.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.733
ALL RIGHT, 69 ONE TIME.

02:13.833 --> 02:14.967
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:15.067 --> 02:18.667
OVER OFF OF CRESTVIEW.
STILL GOT TWO OUTSTANDING.

02:18.767 --> 02:20.067
-HUH?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.800
-YOU GUYS ARE GOING
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.433
-ALL THE CHARGE IS YOURS.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.733
-NO! WHAT CHARGES?
-YOUR BUDDIES PUT YOU IN A JAM.

02:26.833 --> 02:29.233
-NO. I'M IN A JAM?
-YOU JUST TOLD ME
YOU HAD KNOWLEDGE.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.667
-HUH?
-YOU JUST TOLD ME
WHY YOU RAN.

02:31.767 --> 02:34.967
I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS STOLEN UNTIL THEY RAN.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.567
I WASN'T DRIVING.
I WAS IN THE CAR.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.267
-SLOW DOWN.
SO YOU READY TO TALK?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.500
-YEAH. I'M GONNA TELL
YOU EVERYTHING.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.067
-OKAY. WE'RE GONNA TALK
HERE IN A MINUTE.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.567
-YOU GOT HIM PATTED DOWN GOOD?

02:42.667 --> 02:46.767
-YEAH. HE GOT PHONES
AND CONDOMS IN HIS POCKET.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.700
HAVE A SEAT.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.400
THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU GOT TO SAY TO US
BEFORE WE GET BACK UP HERE.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.233
-I ALREADY KNOW.
-YOU ALREADY KNOW?

02:53.333 --> 02:55.300
-I ALREADY KNOW.
-ALL RIGHT.
JUST BE SMART ABOUT IT.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.300
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK UP
TO THE SCENE, WHERE THE CAR IS.
ALL RIGHT?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.800
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:59.900 --> 03:01.800
-SO I PARKED MY CAR, I GOT OUT.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.867
STARTED WALKING UP
BETWEEN TWO HOUSES,
WHERE I COULD SEE A DOG,

03:04.967 --> 03:07.433
-YOU KNOW, RUNNING
BACK AND FORTH IN HIS CAGE.
-YEAH.

03:07.533 --> 03:10.367
UM, AND THEN I SAW HIM POP OUT
OF THE FENCES.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.433
SO, I CHASED HIM OVER HERE

03:12.533 --> 03:14.133
AND THEN HE CAME IN
BEHIND THIS HOUSE

03:14.233 --> 03:16.800
-AND THAT'S WHERE WE GOT HIM.
-DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

03:16.900 --> 03:20.833
YES, HE DID. HE...
SPONTANEOUSLY UTTERED TO ME,

03:20.933 --> 03:22.867
HE SAID...

03:22.967 --> 03:26.433
HE SAID, "YOU GOT THEM GUYS?
THEY'RE RIDING A STOLEN CAR?"

03:26.533 --> 03:28.500
HE'S LIKE, "THEY JUST TOLD ME
IT WAS STOLEN."

03:28.600 --> 03:31.800
-OH, OKAY. GOOD JOB.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.300
ALL RIGHT, FIND OUT
FROM THE HOMEOWNER--

03:34.400 --> 03:36.600
MAKE SURE THEY'RE GOOD,
YOU KNOW.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.967
OBVIOUSLY, THE FRONT
OF THEIR PROPERTY
GOT DAMAGED PRETTY BAD.

03:40.067 --> 03:42.233
(indistinct chatter)

03:42.333 --> 03:44.767
-HI. HOW YOU DOING, MA'AM?
-I'M FINE. HOW ARE YOU?

03:44.867 --> 03:46.900
-I'M GOOD. DEPUTY THOMPSON
OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

03:47.067 --> 03:49.200
UM... WE'RE YOU SITTING
OUT HERE WHEN THIS HAPPENED?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.367
-I WAS IN--
WELL, I SEEN A TAXI COME BY.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.233
-YES, MA'AM.
-IT WAS GOING REAL SLOW.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.200
SO I GOT UP
AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW,

03:55.300 --> 03:57.667
AND THEN I SAW BLUE LIGHTS
AND THIS CAR GOING THAT WAY,

03:57.767 --> 03:59.567
AND HE WENT OFF
ONTO THE GRASS OVER THERE,

03:59.667 --> 04:01.433
SIDESWIPED HIS MAILBOX,

04:01.533 --> 04:04.833
AND THEN, THESE GUYS JUST JUMPED
OUT AND TOOK OFF THAT WAY,

04:04.933 --> 04:07.767
AND THEN THE CAR JUST COME DOWN
AND JUST DRIFTED INTO THE HOUSE.

04:07.867 --> 04:10.233
-HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS CAR AROUND HERE?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.467
-I'VE SEEN THIS CAR
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
GOING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.367
BUT THEY TOOK OFF, THERE WAS
LIKE THREE OR FOUR OF THEM.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.133
-ARE YOU OKAY?
-IF I CAN GET MY BREATH BACK,
I'LL BE OKAY.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.600
-YEAH, SLOW IT DOWN.
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.567
-I... I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT CAR WAS STOLEN.

04:21.667 --> 04:23.767
-WHERE WERE YOU SITTING
IN THE CAR?
-ON THE PASSENGER SEAT.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.767
-YOU WERE SITTING
IN THE PASSENGER SEAT?
-YEAH.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.733
-OKAY.
WHAT MADE YOU RUN?

04:27.833 --> 04:30.833
-BECAUSE I SAW ALL THEM RAN.
I SAW ALL THEM RAN.

04:30.933 --> 04:33.067
AND, MAN, HE TOSSED LIKE...

04:33.167 --> 04:35.900
HE TOSSED ME THE KEYS
BEFORE I LEFT, AND I RAN.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.900
-THAT'S IT.
-AND YOU RAN.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.600
I RAN. EVERYBODY RAN. I WAS
THE LAST ONE TO HOP OUT.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.767
-YOU DIDN'T THINK AT ANY POINT,
YOU SHOULD JUST STOP
AND TELL US,

04:42.867 --> 04:45.133
THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT?

04:45.233 --> 04:47.333
-I MEAN, BUT I JUST GOT OUT
OF JAIL, SIR, YOU FEEL ME?

04:47.433 --> 04:49.333
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE WARRANTS
OUT OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.100
THAT'S WHY I RAN.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.133
-OKAY. WHAT DID YOU GO TO JAIL
FOR RECENTLY?

04:53.233 --> 04:54.733
-VIOLATION OF PROBATION.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.600
-OKAY. SO YOU'RE CURRENTLY
ON PROBATION NOW?

04:56.700 --> 04:58.733
-I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF I HAVE WARRANTS OUT.
I DON'T KNOW.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.067
-SO WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU HOP
IN A CAR WITH THESE GUYS,

05:01.133 --> 05:03.233
NOT KNOWING
IT WAS STOLEN OR NOT?

05:03.333 --> 05:05.800
-THEY DRIVE. THEY HAVE
THEIR LICENSE, EVERYTHING.
THEY HAVE JOBS, EVERYTHING.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.133
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I THINK THEY LEGIT.

05:08.233 --> 05:09.733
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT CAR WAS STOLEN.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.633
I DIDN'T KNOW AT ALL.

05:11.733 --> 05:14.267
-OKAY. YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO THE CAR BELONGS TO EITHER?

05:14.367 --> 05:17.067
-NO.
-ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD
AND HAVE A SEAT.

05:18.667 --> 05:21.633
HE SAID THEY THREW THE KEYS
AT HIM BEFORE HE TOOK OFF.

05:21.733 --> 05:23.367
HE'S LYING, HUH?

05:23.467 --> 05:26.533
-UH, NO. BECAUSE THE KEYS WERE
STILL IN THE IGNITION
WHEN I TURNED IT OFF.

05:26.633 --> 05:30.067
-"THEY THREW ME THE KEYS
BEFORE THEY STARTED RUNNING,"
HUH? NOT TRUE.

05:30.167 --> 05:32.333
-ARE YOU THE OWNER
OF THIS VEHICLE?
-YES, SIR.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.400
-DID YOU KNOW WHO WAS
IN THE VEHICLE, WHO HAD IT?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.800
-NO, SIR.
-NO?

05:35.900 --> 05:39.300
I JUST WALKED IN THE STORE, UH,
YESTERDAY AROUND...

05:39.400 --> 05:43.100
4:45, 5:00,
UH, FOR TEN MINUTES,

05:43.200 --> 05:46.067
AND ON THE WAY BACK OUT,
GO GET IN MY CAR...

05:46.167 --> 05:48.333
-ALL RIGHT.
-...UH, IT WASN'T THERE.

05:48.433 --> 05:53.333
-OKAY. WELL, LATER ON TODAY, WAS
THERE ANYTHING THAT SHOWED YOU,
LIKE, WHO MIGHT'VE HAD YOUR CAR?

05:53.433 --> 05:56.267
-ONCE I GOT
MY NEW PHONE TODAY.

05:56.367 --> 05:59.300
-OKAY.
-I LEFT MY OLD PHONE IN MY CAR
WHEN HE STOLE THE CAR.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.967
-RIGHT.
-I SYNCED EVERYTHING
FROM MY OLD PHONE TO THE NEW.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.467
-OKAY. AND WHAT DID YOU SEE
WHEN YOU SYNCED IT?

06:06.567 --> 06:09.233
HE MUST'VE MADE A VIDEO
OF HIMSELF, UH,

06:09.333 --> 06:11.933
WHICH IS THE EXACT SAME GUY
THAT THEY HAVE.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.633
-YEAH, HE'S ACTUALLY WEARING
THE SAME SHIRT.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.567
THAT'S THE SAME GENTLEMAN
THAT WE HAVE IN CUSTODY.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.167
DO YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

06:17.267 --> 06:19.967
-I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.
-NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.067
-(car door opens)
-STEP OUT HERE REAL QUICK.

06:22.167 --> 06:24.267
WHAT WERE YOU ARRESTED FOR
TEN DAYS AGO?

06:24.367 --> 06:26.200
-FOR POSSESSION
OF A STOLEN VEHICLE.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.867
-POSSESSION OF A STOLEN VEHICLE?
-YES.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.833
-WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
BECAUSE YOU GOT CHARGED
WITH THAT TEN DAYS AGO.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.667
-YEAH, THAT WAS
VIOLATION OF MY PROBATION.

06:33.767 --> 06:37.533
I WAS IN A VEHICLE...
I WASN'T THE ONE EVEN
IN THE VEHICLE.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.433
I WAS GETTING SOMETHING
FROM OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.767
-ALL RIGHT,
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.733
IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE...
IT'S KIND OF LIKE HISTORY
REPEATING ITSELF, YOU KNOW?

06:44.833 --> 06:46.933
BECAUSE YOU WERE CHARGED
WITH THAT TEN DAYS AGO

06:47.067 --> 06:49.267
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE
IN ANOTHER STOLEN VEHICLE.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.933
-IF I DON'T FIND HIM,
I'M TELLING EVERYTHING,

06:52.067 --> 06:53.767
I'M TELLING EVERYTHING ON HIM,
STRAIGHT UP.

06:53.867 --> 06:56.933
-ALL RIGHT. RIGHT NOW,
AT THIS POINT,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED

06:57.067 --> 06:58.867
WITH POSSESSION
OF A STOLEN VEHICLE,

06:58.967 --> 07:01.400
AND FAILURE TO STOP
FOR BLUE LIGHT AND SIREN. OKAY?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.067
-COME ON, DAWG!

07:03.133 --> 07:04.533
-IT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION
RIGHT NOW.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.100
IT'S A REAL BAD SITUATION.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.767
-I'M FROM KANSAS CITY,
SO IT KIND OF GIVES ME

07:09.867 --> 07:11.533
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
WHEN DEALING WITH FOLKS.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.967
I USED TO BE A SCHOOLTEACHER,
SO I'VE RUN INTO A LOT
OF MY OLD STUDENTS,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.967
OLD PARENTS.
THIS IS FAMILY.

07:16.067 --> 07:18.467
THAT'S ONE THING
THAT MOTIVATES ME EVERYDAY.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.767
I CAN BE SOMEBODY'S SUPER HERO.

07:20.867 --> 07:23.067
'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW,
YOU COULD BE SAVING
SOMEBODY'S LIFE,

07:23.100 --> 07:27.400
GETTING SOMEBODY OUT
OF A SITUATION WHERE THEY FEEL
LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A WAY OUT.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.933
-(siren blares)
-WE'VE GOT
A POSSIBLE 10-55 DRIVER.

07:31.067 --> 07:34.333
UM, OFFICERS OBSERVED IT
RUNNING PEOPLE OFF THE ROAD.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.567
IT HIT A CONCRETE BARRIER.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.533
SO, UH, WE'RE GOING TO TRY
AND GET IN THE AREA

07:39.633 --> 07:41.900
AND SEE IF WE CAN, UH,
POSSIBLY THROW OUT STOP STICKS.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.600
BUT HE'S ON THE HIGHWAY
RIGHT NOW.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.800
-OH, HE'S RIGHT HERE.
HE'S COMING UP RIGHT NEXT TO US.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.067
HE'S SUPER DRUNK.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.100
-HE'S PRETTY OUT OF IT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW...

07:51.200 --> 07:53.833
-LET ME CALL, SEE IF WE CAN CALL
AND GET SOME STICKS.

07:53.933 --> 07:57.700
-(siren blaring)
-(indistinct radio chatter)

07:57.800 --> 08:00.633
-WHAT IS HE DOING?
-WHAT IS HE DOING
WITH HIS DOOR OPEN?

08:00.733 --> 08:03.967
WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN FRONT
OF HIM AND GET SOME STICKS.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.067
YEAH, HE'S NOT GOING
TO GET OFF ANYWHERE.

08:06.133 --> 08:10.067
YEAH. PULLED A NICE ONE,
HE'S NOT EVEN RECOGNIZING
THAT WE'RE HERE,

08:10.133 --> 08:12.867
OR AROUND HIM, SO...

08:15.067 --> 08:17.200
-OH, HE'S COMING!

08:17.300 --> 08:21.167
(sirens approaching)

08:29.333 --> 08:31.800
-SO, HE'S STILL GOING
PRETTY CRAZY?

08:31.900 --> 08:33.167
-YEAH.

08:33.267 --> 08:34.433
(siren blaring)

08:34.533 --> 08:37.367
-SO, SAID HE HIT SOME STICKS.
JUST NOT SURE, UH...

08:37.467 --> 08:39.533
WHICH TIRES RIGHT NOW, BUT...

08:39.633 --> 08:42.100
HE'S SLOWING DOWN.
I'M NOT SURE IF
HE'S GOING TO PULL OVER

08:42.200 --> 08:43.800
OR IF HE'S GOING TO TRY
TO KEEP GOING.

08:43.900 --> 08:47.067
BUT WE PULLED A NICE ONE.
HE'S NOT EVEN RECOGNIZING
THAT WE'RE THERE.

08:47.167 --> 08:50.067
UH, SO HE'S PRETTY OUT OF IT.

08:50.167 --> 08:53.067
HE MAY JUST GO
UNTIL HIS CAR STOPS.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.433
-IS HE DONE?

08:55.533 --> 08:58.733
-HE JUST... MAYBE HE JUST
REALIZED THAT WE'RE BEHIND HIM.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.067
(sirens stop)

09:04.067 --> 09:06.967
-HANDS OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE!
(shouting indistinctly)

09:07.067 --> 09:09.600
STEP OUT OF THE CAR NOW!

09:09.700 --> 09:12.167
GET OUT OF THE CAR, HANDS UP!

09:12.267 --> 09:14.433
-GET OUT OF THE CAR!
-GET ON THE GROUND!

09:14.533 --> 09:15.633
-GET ON THE GROUND NOW!

09:15.733 --> 09:18.200
-GET BACK!
-HE CAN'T EVEN GET
ON THE GROUND.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.700
-GET ON THE GROUND NOW!

09:20.800 --> 09:23.067
-HE'S GOING, GOING.
-GET ON THE GROUND!

09:23.167 --> 09:26.233
GET ON THE GROUND,
ALL THE WAY DOWN!

09:26.333 --> 09:29.133
(indistinct shouting)

09:34.567 --> 09:36.667
-SO HE HIT STICKS TWICE?

09:36.767 --> 09:38.433
-HIT TWO SETS OF STICKS
FROM THEIR VEHICLE.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.267
-ROLL HIM UP.
-ROLL RIGHT HERE.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.700
-OKAY.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.767
-WHY WERE YOU RUNNING?

09:43.867 --> 09:45.333
-RUNNING, FROM WHAT?

09:45.433 --> 09:47.300
-WE WERE TRYING
TO PULL YOU OVER.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.067
-I WAS JUST RUNNING TO GO HOME.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.867
-WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
-BRING YOUR LEG BACK.

09:51.967 --> 09:55.533
-I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE TALKING TO ME.

09:55.633 --> 09:56.600
SORRY.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.167
-YOU DIDN'T SEE THE CARS
COME BEHIND YOU?

09:58.267 --> 09:59.700
-NO.
-YOU DIDN'T SEE
THE LIGHTS AND SIRENS?

09:59.800 --> 10:02.667
-NO, I WAS LISTENING
TO MY RADIO.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.400
-WHAT HAVE YOU HAD
TO DRINK TODAY?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.200
HMM?

10:07.300 --> 10:09.000
DO YOU REMEMBER RUNNING
ANYBODY OFF THE ROAD?

10:09.100 --> 10:12.433
-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SOMEBODY
WAS TRYING TO STOP ME.

10:12.533 --> 10:14.033
-HOW MUCH HAVE YOU HAD
TO DRINK TODAY?

10:14.133 --> 10:16.900
-NOT ENOUGH TO BE PULLED OVER.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.667
-ARE YOU-- DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS?

10:20.767 --> 10:22.500
-YEAH.
-WHAT KIND OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS?

10:22.600 --> 10:23.567
-I HAVE DIABETES.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.067
I HAVE THYROIDS.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.833
-I TAKE PROZAC AND VALIUM.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.300
-AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.500
-NO.
-OKAY.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.900
-SO, YOU'RE JUST HEADING HOME,
HUH? THAT'S IT?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.233
-YEAH. I CAN SHOW YOU
MY PILLS.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.700
-WE'RE NOT GONNA WORRY
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.167
-YEAH, I'VE GOT A BAG

10:41.267 --> 10:43.000
WITH MY PILLS, THAT'S IT.
-YOU GOT A BAG?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.633
HOW MANY PILLS
DO YOU TAKE?

10:44.733 --> 10:47.400
-I TAKE ABOUT FIVE A DAY.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.867
-FIVE A DAY?
-YEAH.

10:48.967 --> 10:50.333
-OKAY.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.333
-HEY, HOW MANY STICKS
DID HE HIT?

10:52.433 --> 10:54.233
-HIT TWO SETS OF STICKS
FROM THEIR VEHICLE.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.300
-SO, YOURS STUCK HIM?
-OUR STICKS? YES.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.933
-MY GUY.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.100
SO, HE, DID HE HIT A MEDIAN?
WHAT DID HE HIT?
-YEAH.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.167
THEY SAID HE HIT
I-70 AND PASEO.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.200
-HEY, WHO'S 123?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.567
-RIGHT HERE.
-RIGHT HERE, SARGE.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.767
UH, RIGHT AT I-70 AND PASEO,

11:10.867 --> 11:12.533
THEY SAID HE SLAMMED
INTO THE MEDIAN

11:12.633 --> 11:15.400
AND THEN CONTINUED DRIVING
UNTIL WE GOT UP BEHIND HIM.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.867
-YEAH, HE'S GOT A BUNCH
OF MEDICATIONS THERE.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.767
HE'S OFF.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.533
HAVE YOU HAD YOUR INSULIN
SHOT TODAY, SIR?

11:23.633 --> 11:26.433
-NO.
-WHAT TIME, OR WHEN
DO YOU USUALLY TAKE IT?

11:26.533 --> 11:29.500
-I TAKE IT THREE TIMES A DAY.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.133
-HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
HAD IT TODAY?

11:31.233 --> 11:32.667
-I HAVEN'T HAD IT TODAY YET.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.600
-OKAY.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.633
-YOU'RE INSULIN DEPENDENT?
-YEAH.

11:36.733 --> 11:39.333
-AND YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN
ANY INSULIN TODAY?
-NONE TODAY.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.367
-ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT A GREAT THING.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.067
-NO.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.633
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN HAVING ISSUES
WITH YOUR DIABETES?

11:45.733 --> 11:48.367
-10 YEARS.
-10 YEARS?

11:48.467 --> 11:49.800
-YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.700
-RIGHT.
-WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO...

11:51.800 --> 11:53.067
-I DON'T KNOW.

11:53.167 --> 11:59.267
-WHEN YOUR INSURANCE GOES
FROM FREE TO 227 BUCKS A MONTH?

12:01.700 --> 12:02.933
-YOU SMELL ANY ALCOHOL?

12:03.067 --> 12:04.900
-THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING HIM
IF HE HAD ANY MEDICAL--

12:05.067 --> 12:06.800
-'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
SMELL ALCOHOL.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.300
SO, RIGHT NOW,
THEY'RE CHECKING HIM OUT.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.667
HE HAS A...
TOLD HE SUFFERS FROM DIABETIC.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.433
HE HAD A FEW MEDS
IN HIS BAG.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.767
WE'RE JUST CHECKING
TO MAKE SURE HIS BLOOD SUGAR
IS OKAY.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.267
WE REALLY DON'T
SMELL ANY ALCOHOL.

12:19.367 --> 12:22.167
SO, IT MAY REALLY BE
SOMETHING DEALING WITH DIABETIC.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.333
-HE'S A LITTLE HIGH. 332.

12:24.433 --> 12:25.467
IT IS HIGH.
-OH, YEAH.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.333
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
INTOXICATED REALLY.

12:27.433 --> 12:31.833
HE JUST-- I MEAN, STUDIES SHOW
THAT WHEN SOMEBODY'S IN DIABETIC
STRESS OR WHATEVER,

12:31.933 --> 12:34.933
IT'S JUST AS MUCH
AS SOMEBODY DRIVING INTOXICATED.

12:35.067 --> 12:37.900
SO, YEAH. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT 120, HE'S AT 330.

12:38.067 --> 12:40.200
SO, HE'S WELL PAST
WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.600
SO, WE'RE GONNA GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL. GET HIM
SQUARED AWAY.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.367
-READY, ONE, TWO, THREE.
-THANK YOU.

12:46.467 --> 12:48.267
ALL RIGHT.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.933
-YEAH, WE GOT HIM.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.600
-WHEN I WAS GOING
AROUND THE CORNER,

12:52.700 --> 12:54.167
HE WAS KIND OF
WEAVING AROUND THE LANES.

12:54.267 --> 12:56.767
SO, I KNEW IT WAS HIM.
THAT'S WHY I FLEW UP

12:56.867 --> 12:58.633
TO TRY TO GET
THE STICKS OUT.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.967
-HE WAS GOING MAYBE
15 MILES PER HOUR.

13:01.067 --> 13:04.200
AND THEN AS WE GOT BEHIND HIM,
HE STARTED GOING UP A LITTLE
BIT, UP A LITTLE BIT.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.133
HE GOT UP TO ABOUT
40 TO 60 MILES PER HOUR.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.900
-'CAUSE HONESTLY,
DRIVING PAST HIM,

13:09.067 --> 13:11.567
HUTH LOOKED RIGHT AT HIM.
-I LOOKED RIGHT AT HIM.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.300
HE WAS STRAIGHT AHEAD.
-HE WAS JUST DRIVING.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.433
JUST THOUGHT HE WAS...
-YEAH, I SAW HIM.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.167
-YEAH, I MEAN,
HE WAS JUST DRIVING.

13:17.267 --> 13:18.333
WE GOT CLOSE ENOUGH
AT ONE POINT

13:18.433 --> 13:19.867
THAT I COULD SEE HIM
LOOKING BACK.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.200
SAW HIM LOOK BACK,
AND I'M LIKE, "HE DOESN'T
LOOK INTOXICATED."

13:22.300 --> 13:24.067
-SO, WHAT THEY'LL DO,
THEY'LL TAKE HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.333
THEY'LL DO A BLOOD DRAW ON HIM.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.100
CHECK OUT HIS ALCOHOL LEVEL
THROUGH HIS BLOOD DRAW,

13:27.200 --> 13:30.200
AND THEN GO FROM THERE,
AND TELL IF IT'S ALCOHOL,
OR IF IT'S DIABETIC STUFF.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.300
THE HOSPITAL WILL BE ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WHAT.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.967
YOU KNOW, THANK GOODNESS
HE ONLY HIT A MEDIAN
AND NOT ANYBODY ELSE.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.300
-I'VE BEEN WITH
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE
A COUPLE YEARS NOW.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.300
I CAME INTO THE JOB
KNOWING THE DANGERS.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.900
BUT EARLY ON IN MY CAREER,
I HAD A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH A SUBJECT.

13:45.067 --> 13:46.933
AND, BEING NEW,
IT GAVE ME A WAKE UP CALL

13:47.067 --> 13:48.333
TO WHAT THIS JOB
IS REALLY ABOUT.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.633
THIS STUFF IS REAL.
THERE'S EVIL OUT HERE
THAT EXISTS

13:50.733 --> 13:52.067
THAT PEOPLE JUST DON'T THINK OF.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.367
AND IT'S...

13:54.467 --> 13:56.700
JUST OPENED MY EYES
TO WHAT WE DEAL WITH OUT HERE.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.933
I SAW A COUPLE CARS
PARKED AWKWARDLY ON THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.267
ONE OF THEM HAD
THEIR LIGHTS OFF.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.467
THIS BEING A HIGH DRUG AREA,
LOT OF CRIME THROUGH HERE,

14:04.567 --> 14:05.800
WE'RE JUST GONNA SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.867
(radio chatter)

14:07.967 --> 14:09.433
-HEY, STAY IN THE CAR.

14:09.533 --> 14:12.333
FIVE-ALPHA, COUNTY 6-5-13.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.300
HOW YOU DOING?
-SORRY, I JUST PULLED OVER
INTO THE THING TO USE THE PHONE.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.733
I'M SORRY.
-OKAY.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.633
-MY HUSBAND-- WE JUST
PULLED OVER. THE CAR'S
ACTING FUNNY

14:21.733 --> 14:22.767
AND IT BROKE DOWN,
I'M SORRY.

14:22.867 --> 14:24.567
-IT'S LIKE-- YEAH.
-THIS CAR BROKE DOWN?

14:24.667 --> 14:26.367
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BRAND NEW.
-I DON'T-- YEAH.

14:26.467 --> 14:27.667
IT'S BRAND--
I DON'T KNOW.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.767
IT JUST WAS ACTING FUNNY
SO HE PULLED OVER.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.667
AND WE'RE WAITING FOR--
-THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND UP THERE?

14:31.767 --> 14:34.200
-YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU GUYS
FROM THE AREA?

14:34.300 --> 14:37.900
-NO. WE'RE GOING BACK
TO MY BOSS' HOUSE.
WE BROUGHT HIM HERE,

14:38.067 --> 14:40.400
BUT WE JUST...

14:40.500 --> 14:41.600
SEEING HIM, AND THEN--
-OKAY.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.533
YOU SEEM EXTREMELY NERVOUS.
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:43.633 --> 14:45.067
-YEAH. I JUST DON'T LIKE
GETTING IN TROUBLE.

14:45.133 --> 14:46.833
-YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.
NOBODY SAID YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.400
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE
YOU GUYS ARE GOOD.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.667
-YES.
-DO YOU HAVE YOUR I.D. WITH YOU?

14:49.767 --> 14:51.200
-NO. I DON'T.
-YOU DON'T?

14:51.300 --> 14:53.200
DO ME A QUICK FAVOR,
JUST STEP OUT OF THE CAR
FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

14:53.300 --> 14:55.467
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON YOU
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE?
-NO, NO, NO.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.133
-OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY POCKETS
THAT ARE--
-YES.

14:57.233 --> 14:58.667
-NOTHING IN YOUR POCKETS
OR NOTHING?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.667
-NOTHING.
-ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA
SHUT THIS DOOR REAL QUICK.

15:00.767 --> 15:01.933
-OKAY.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.300
-AND YOU SAID IT'S
YOUR BOSS' CAR?
-YES, IT IS.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.267
-IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS CAR?
ANY WEAPONS IN THE VEHICLE?

15:05.367 --> 15:06.800
-NO. THERE'S NO WEAPONS
IN THE VEHICLE AT ALL.

15:06.900 --> 15:07.833
-OKAY. IS THERE ANY
KIND OF...

15:07.933 --> 15:10.900
-THERE'S, UM... NO.

15:11.067 --> 15:14.133
I DON'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

15:14.233 --> 15:16.467
YOU CAN GO THROUGH ANYTHING.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.600
-YOU DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH ME SEARCHING THAT CAR?

15:18.700 --> 15:20.067
-NO.
-ALL RIGHT, HANG TIGHT
RIGHT THERE

15:20.133 --> 15:22.633
FOR A COUPLE MORE MINUTES.
I APPRECIATE IT.

15:22.733 --> 15:25.600
THE LAST NAME SHE GAVE ME
IS NOT SHOWING AS HER LAST NAME.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.667
HER LAST NAME'S ACTUALLY
SHOWING SOMETHING
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.533
AND SHE'S SHOWING
A POSSIBLE WARRANT
OUT OF OUR COUNTY.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.733
SO, WE'LL SEE.

15:31.833 --> 15:34.500
THEY'RE JUST GONNA CONFIRM IT
FOR ME.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.767
JESSICA, DO ME A QUICK FAVOR.

15:35.867 --> 15:38.233
-YEAH?
-SET THE PHONE DOWN
AND STAND UP FOR ME.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.267
-OOH, HOLD ON.

15:40.367 --> 15:41.467
OKAY.
-TURN AROUND.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.367
SET THE PHONE ON THE TRUNK
FOR ME FOR A SECOND.

15:43.467 --> 15:44.933
-WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:45.067 --> 15:46.267
-IT'S SHOWING YOU HAVE
A WARRANT.

15:46.367 --> 15:49.133
SO, JUST RELAX A SECOND.
-OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.100
OH, NO, NO, NO...
-STOP, STOP, STOP!

15:51.200 --> 15:52.133
STOP!
-PLEASE, DON'T.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.633
-STOP FOR A SECOND. RELAX.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.367
-NOTHING GONNA POKE ME OR STICK
ME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
-NO. NO.

15:57.567 --> 16:00.167
-OKAY. HAVE A SEAT
FOR A MINUTE.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.367
(whimpers)

16:01.467 --> 16:04.133
-HEY, WHAT'S
YOUR DATE OF BIRTH? '84?

16:04.233 --> 16:05.967
-YES.
-OKAY. HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN MARRIED BEFORE?

16:06.067 --> 16:07.400
-I-- NO.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.533
-YOU'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED?

16:08.633 --> 16:09.567
-NO.
-OKAY.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.267
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

16:13.233 --> 16:16.667
-I AM MARRIED.
I'M MARRIED TO HIM.

16:19.233 --> 16:20.900
-THAT'S THE LAST NAME
I FOUND YOU UNDER.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.267
WHAT I SEE ON THE COMPUTER
IS SHOWING ME THAT IT'S YOU.

16:23.367 --> 16:24.967
-SO...
-I'VE NEVER HAD
A WARRANT THOUGH.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.567
-OKAY.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.167
ALL RIGHT.
HANG TIGHT FOR A SECOND.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.733
WATCH YOUR KNEE, OKAY?

16:29.833 --> 16:31.333
WATCH YOUR KNEE
AND YOUR FOOT THERE.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.600
-WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A SAFE?
-YEAH.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.733
OH, IT'S A BOOK THAT'S GOT
A LOCKBOX INSIDE.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.200
SO, WE'LL SEE.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.967
JUST TO MAKE SURE
WITH THE TOW COMPANY.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.200
JESSICA, AS FAR AS THE CAR GOES

16:48.300 --> 16:50.500
ON KINDA LIVING OUT OF THERE,
HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN?

16:50.600 --> 16:54.067
-UM, JUST FOR, LIKE,
THE PAST WEEK OR SO.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.700
'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS HAVING
TO GO OUT TO HIM.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.633
-ALL RIGHT. COME TAKE A LOOK
AT A COUPLE THINGS FOR ME
REAL QUICK.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.200
WHAT IS THIS?

17:05.300 --> 17:06.767
-IT'S A SAFE.
-OKAY.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.767
-MY HUSBAND GOT IT.

17:08.867 --> 17:10.167
-YOUR HUSBAND BOUGHT IT?

17:10.267 --> 17:12.067
HAS HE BEEN LETTING
YOU USE IT, THOUGH?

17:12.167 --> 17:15.700
-WELL, EVERYONE USES IT
THAT GOES IN MY THING.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.067
-I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

17:17.100 --> 17:19.100
-I HAVEN'T USED IT LATELY.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.967
-YOU HAVEN'T USED IT LATELY.
WHAT'S LATELY?

17:22.233 --> 17:24.167
-PAST COUPLE DAYS.
I'VE BEEN AT MY BOSS' HOUSE.

17:24.267 --> 17:26.700
-OKAY. BUT YOU USED IT
BEFORE THAT?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.633
-YEAH. TO HOLD MY I.D.S
AND MY CREDIT CARD.

17:28.733 --> 17:30.400
WHATEVER I DON'T PUT
IN MY LITTLE PURSE UP THERE.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.433
-OKAY.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.467
SO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
IN HERE AS OF RIGHT NOW?

17:34.567 --> 17:36.200
-NOT COMPLETELY. NO.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.367
-OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND
OF IDEA WHAT'S IN HERE?

17:40.233 --> 17:42.833
(sobbing)
-I DON'T KNOW.

17:42.933 --> 17:44.700
-HUH?
-I DON'T KNOW.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.300
-OKAY, SO WHAT IS IN HERE?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.333
IT'S IN YOUR CAR.
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.800
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE HONEST WITH ME?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.167
HUH?

17:52.267 --> 17:53.533
OKAY. JESSICA?

17:53.633 --> 17:55.233
THERE'S NO ISSUES
WITH THIS, CORRECT?

17:55.333 --> 17:57.200
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE GONNA
GET IN TROUBLE FOR IT.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW--

17:57.300 --> 18:00.200
I JUST WANT TO OPEN CONTAINERS,
AND I WANT YOU TO BE OKAY
WITH IT.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.533
OKAY?

18:01.633 --> 18:03.633
-THAT'S FINE.

18:03.733 --> 18:05.533
-THIS ONE'S YOURS, TOO?

18:05.633 --> 18:08.200
-THAT'S MY HUSBAND'S.
-THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND'S?

18:09.433 --> 18:11.100
-YOU SERIOUS?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.067
-JESSICA, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS IS?

18:14.100 --> 18:16.333
-A WHOLE KIT
FOR, LIKE, SHOOTING UP.

18:16.433 --> 18:17.367
-SHOOTING UP WHAT?

18:17.467 --> 18:19.067
-WHATEVER IS IN THERE.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.233
-OKAY. STEP BACK OVER
TO MY CAR REAL QUICK.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.867
OR, THIS OTHER DEPUTY'S
CAR, PLEASE.

18:25.433 --> 18:27.667
(sobbing)

18:27.767 --> 18:28.800
-I'M SORRY?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.300
-YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE.

18:31.400 --> 18:35.100
-I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
TO TELL ME. I WAS GIVING YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY, JESSICA.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.233
-I DON'T KNOW ALL
OF WHAT'S IN THERE.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.133
-THE LAST TIME YOU CHECKED
THE SAFE, WHICH WAS TWO DAYS
AGO, IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

18:40.233 --> 18:43.067
-THERE WAS THREE NEEDLES
OR MORE NEEDLES, YEAH.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.567
'CAUSE I PUT THEM IN THERE.
-OKAY.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.833
-'CAUSE I DON'T CARRY STUFF
THAT I USE ON ME.

18:46.933 --> 18:47.900
-OKAY.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.333
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE A SEAT FOR A MINUTE.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.067
WATCH YOUR HEAD
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.200
-THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.433
-I APPRECIATE
YOUR HONESTY, OKAY?

18:55.533 --> 18:57.600
JUST GIVE US
A COUPLE MINUTES.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.300
I TALKED TO THE OTHER HALF
THAT WAS OVER THERE.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.867
HE HAD AN UNRELATED
WARRANT TO THIS.

19:04.967 --> 19:07.567
HE IS DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE.
-THE OTHER HALF THAT LEFT
FROM HERE?

19:07.667 --> 19:09.333
-THE OTHER HALF
THAT LEFT FROM HERE.

19:09.433 --> 19:10.700
IT'S ACTUALLY HER HUSBAND.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.433
BUT HE'S DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE
OF ANY KIND OF NARCOTICS.

19:13.533 --> 19:15.333
-RIGHT.
-HE'S DISASSOCIATING HIMSELF
FROM HER.

19:15.433 --> 19:16.967
-OKAY.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.633
HEY, JESSICA.

19:20.733 --> 19:22.433
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU
REAL QUICK, OKAY?

19:22.533 --> 19:24.867
YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING
TO JAIL FOR THE NIGHT.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.567
TONIGHT FOR, UM,

19:26.667 --> 19:30.433
YOU HAVE THE WARRANT,
FIRST OF ALL. OKAY?

19:30.533 --> 19:32.467
YOU HAVE DRIVING
ON A SUSPENDED.

19:32.567 --> 19:34.900
WHICH, YOU HAVE
FOUR CONVICTIONS ALREADY.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.200
SO, IT'S THIRD OR SUBSEQUENT.
THAT'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER FELONY, OKAY?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.100
THEN YOU HAVE POSSESSION
OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.533
AND THEN THE STUFF THAT WAS
IN THE BLACK CASE TESTED
POSITIVE FOR HEROIN.

19:42.633 --> 19:44.533
SO, THERE'S GONNA BE FOUR
FELONY CHARGES TONIGHT, OKAY?

19:44.633 --> 19:48.200
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO HIT
ROCK BOTTOM BEFORE THEY CAN
START GETTING BACK UP.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.400
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.067
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:52.167 --> 19:53.833
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.933 --> 19:54.867
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.967 --> 19:57.933
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.167 --> 20:06.100
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.700
-(theme music playing)
