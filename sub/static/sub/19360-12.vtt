Shane Smith:
<i>This week on "Vice,"</i>

00:08.370 --> 00:12.239
<i>the staggering surge of
incarcerated women in America.</i>

00:14.209 --> 00:16.076
<i>The overwhelming
majority of women</i>

00:16.111 --> 00:17.910
are there
for non-violent crimes.

00:19.881 --> 00:21.147
Your legs are
shackled to the bed.

00:21.182 --> 00:22.915
Yeung: Whilst the
C-section's happening?

00:22.951 --> 00:26.352
Like that's the point when you're
gonna run away. I know, right!

00:26.387 --> 00:28.587
Smith: <i>And then, how the
threat of forgeries</i>

00:28.623 --> 00:31.658
<i>is causing turmoil
in the art world.</i>

00:31.693 --> 00:34.192
Rainer Crone: Fantastic.
Ben Anderson: Same paint.

00:34.227 --> 00:36.161
Same acetate, same everything.

00:36.196 --> 00:37.963
This is probably
in excess of 200

00:37.998 --> 00:40.165
or $300 million dollars worth

00:40.200 --> 00:42.000
<i>of paintings that you
could make with these.</i>

00:48.976 --> 00:50.108
Isobel Yeung:
Go, go, go!

00:52.945 --> 00:54.378
Refugee:
We are not animals!

01:05.591 --> 01:08.191
Last year, we followed
President Obama

01:08.226 --> 01:10.326
as he made history
becoming the first

01:10.361 --> 01:11.227
sitting US President

01:11.262 --> 01:14.297
<i>to actually enter
a federal prison.</i>

01:14.332 --> 01:15.464
Obama: How y'all doing?
- Alright.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.801
- How you doing, sir?
- Alright.

01:17.836 --> 01:20.336
Smith: <i>Now, our special
report focused on men</i>

01:20.371 --> 01:22.138
<i>caught up in the system's
harsh treatment</i>

01:22.174 --> 01:24.273
<i>of non-violent
drug offenders,</i>

01:24.309 --> 01:26.474
but lost in the debate
is the fact that

01:26.510 --> 01:27.442
<i>women are actually</i>

01:27.477 --> 01:29.411
<i>the fastest-growing
population</i>

01:29.446 --> 01:31.213
of inmates in America.

Jennifer Goodwin: Face the wall, please.
Face the wall.

01:51.601 --> 01:52.767
Hands on the wall.

01:52.802 --> 01:54.802
You need to be leaning
into the wall!

01:54.838 --> 01:57.171
If you're not leaning,
you and me have a problem.

02:25.099 --> 02:26.598
Yeung: <i>The Bexar
County Jail houses</i>

02:26.634 --> 02:29.735
<i>around 600 women
at any given time.</i>

02:29.771 --> 02:31.904
<i>They gave us access
to their intake process</i>

02:31.939 --> 02:34.639
<i>as a group of women
were being booked in.</i>

03:03.903 --> 03:05.068
Yeung:
<i>Since 1980,</i>

03:05.104 --> 03:07.303
<i>the number of women
incarcerated in America</i>

03:07.338 --> 03:10.339
<i>has increased by more than 700%.</i>

03:10.374 --> 03:12.441
<i>Congresswoman
Karen Bass has watched</i>

03:12.476 --> 03:15.344
<i>as the population of
American women behind bars</i>

03:15.379 --> 03:17.847
<i>has grown to be
the largest in the world.</i>

03:17.882 --> 03:19.248
Do you think that there's
enough momentum

03:19.284 --> 03:21.918
behind criminal justice reform
for incarcerated women?

03:21.953 --> 03:24.652
I do not believe there's
enough momentum right now.

03:24.688 --> 03:28.123
What I have found is
my... my colleagues

03:28.158 --> 03:31.960
were very enthusiastic
around criminal justice reform,

03:31.995 --> 03:33.428
and as they moved forward,

03:33.463 --> 03:36.998
did not recognize that they
were not including women.

03:37.034 --> 03:39.801
It was an oversight
due to lack of understanding.

03:39.837 --> 03:44.171
<i>Women go to prison for very
different reasons than men.</i>

03:44.207 --> 03:46.240
The overwhelming
majority of women

03:46.275 --> 03:48.108
are there for
non-violent crimes.

03:48.144 --> 03:52.079
<i>The average woman
that winds up incarcerated,</i>

03:52.114 --> 03:54.514
her pathway to incarceration

03:54.550 --> 03:57.084
is a long line of abuse

03:57.119 --> 03:59.052
that is never dealt with,

03:59.087 --> 04:01.187
and then she winds up
getting trapped

04:01.223 --> 04:02.922
in the criminal justice system.

04:04.226 --> 04:05.458
Yeung: <i>We wanted to
know what it was like</i>

04:05.493 --> 04:08.728
<i>for the unprecedented number
of women now trapped inside,</i>

04:08.763 --> 04:11.530
<i>and to see how the system
itself was coping.</i>

04:11.566 --> 04:14.400
- Do not remove your hands.
- Do you understand me? Yep.

04:14.435 --> 04:15.633
Yes, Ma'am.

04:15.669 --> 04:18.237
Yeung: <i>How do you normally
treat the intakes?</i>

04:18.272 --> 04:19.338
The people coming in?

04:19.373 --> 04:20.172
Well, with the intakes,

04:20.207 --> 04:21.874
I'm a lot more stern
with the intakes.

04:21.909 --> 04:23.842
Cause I need to set an attitude.

04:23.878 --> 04:25.610
If you come in,
and I'm all smiley,

04:25.645 --> 04:26.711
you're gonna be glad to be here.

04:26.747 --> 04:28.313
I don't want you
to be glad to be here.

04:28.349 --> 04:30.615
Get back out of the doorway!

04:30.650 --> 04:32.250
There's a whole cell
back there. Use it!

04:33.586 --> 04:36.988
Yeung: <i>Male offenders are processed
in the same facility as women.</i>

04:37.023 --> 04:39.357
<i>Both populations have
increased so dramatically,</i>

04:39.392 --> 04:43.361
<i>that Bexar County has opened
multiple new housing units.</i>

04:43.396 --> 04:46.330
John Lauer: I've seen some
people get hurt in this place.

04:46.366 --> 04:47.965
Officers and inmates.

04:48.001 --> 04:50.233
Women are just as bad as the men.
Yeah?

04:50.269 --> 04:51.601
I've been...
I've been attacked

04:51.636 --> 04:53.169
by women more than once.

04:54.439 --> 04:56.306
Which is kind of scary.

04:57.943 --> 04:59.042
Yeung:
<i>And it's your jail policy</i>

04:59.077 --> 05:01.344
for everyone to be
wearing a-a uniform?

05:12.689 --> 05:15.057
We are about to spend
the night in the jail.

05:15.092 --> 05:16.491
Nothing's allowed in.

05:16.527 --> 05:19.795
All jewelery off,
hair bands, everything...

05:19.830 --> 05:23.131
that could potentially be
used as a weapon.

05:25.835 --> 05:27.001
Hi, ladies.

05:28.571 --> 05:30.071
Yeung:
Hey.

05:30.106 --> 05:31.406
So, this is it, I guess.

05:31.441 --> 05:33.007
Uh...

05:34.911 --> 05:36.945
I've got a blanket inside,

05:36.980 --> 05:38.980
although it's pretty
hot in here.

05:39.015 --> 05:42.582
Pretty gross-looking sheet,
which I think is the bed sheet,

05:42.617 --> 05:44.985
and this, which is toiletries.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.954
Yeung: Is this all the
toiletries you guys get?

05:56.365 --> 05:58.730
Is it tough, you know, like...

05:58.766 --> 06:01.867
peeing and going to the toilet
in front of everyone? No.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.036
Yeung:
Yeah, you're just here!

06:04.072 --> 06:06.305
You've got a perfect
viewing platform.

06:06.341 --> 06:08.507
Are some of you guys
in here for the same reason?

06:09.643 --> 06:11.143
What kind of reasons?

06:16.816 --> 06:17.983
Yeung:
What are you in here for?

06:19.419 --> 06:20.852
How long were you using for?

06:24.557 --> 06:25.890
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

06:25.925 --> 06:27.658
Is this your first time in here?

06:34.400 --> 06:36.933
Someone needs the toilet?
Alright, we'll move out.

06:46.145 --> 06:48.077
This is lights out?

06:50.115 --> 06:51.647
It's super bright in here.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.883
It's gonna be really
frigging hard to sleep.

06:59.457 --> 07:01.590
Yeung:
<i>After barely three hours,</i>

07:01.626 --> 07:03.159
<i>the lights were on again.</i>

07:09.133 --> 07:11.066
Yeung:
It's 3:30 in the morning.

07:11.101 --> 07:13.835
Officers have just
woken everyone up

07:13.870 --> 07:15.904
to serve breakfast.

07:15.939 --> 07:19.207
I think so that they can stagger
it throughout the jail.

07:21.345 --> 07:22.776
Yeung:
<i>Meals are served in shifts</i>

07:22.811 --> 07:24.578
<i>in an attempt to deal
with the sheer number</i>

07:24.613 --> 07:27.714
<i>of non-violent offenders
now crowding the cells.</i>

07:27.750 --> 07:30.484
My charge is felony possession

07:30.520 --> 07:33.020
of a controlled substance
under a gram.

07:33.056 --> 07:34.721
It was tampering
with government records,

07:34.757 --> 07:36.424
and I had a fake ID.

07:36.459 --> 07:39.559
Making checks, writing checks.

07:39.594 --> 07:40.993
ID stuff.

07:41.029 --> 07:42.462
Stormy:
Prostitution.

07:42.497 --> 07:43.930
- Amanda: It's all money.
- Mmm.

07:43.965 --> 07:46.866
And then money leading to drugs.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.634
Yeung: How many addicts
are there in here?

07:48.670 --> 07:51.571
- Most are.
- I think everybody's an addict in some way.

07:52.774 --> 07:54.640
Yeung: <i>Since many laws
require mandatory</i>

07:54.676 --> 07:56.841
<i>minimum sentences
for drug crimes,</i>

07:56.877 --> 07:58.177
<i>judges like Nancy Gertner</i>

07:58.212 --> 07:59.678
<i>find they fail to
take into account</i>

07:59.713 --> 08:02.281
<i>the specific
circumstances of women.</i>

08:02.316 --> 08:06.017
The factors in the system
distorted the sentencing.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.053
It's not just that women got

08:08.089 --> 08:10.189
higher sentences
than they should have.

08:10.224 --> 08:14.425
It is that sometimes they
got higher sentences than men.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.395
<i>You rarely found
women at the top</i>

08:17.430 --> 08:19.397
of a drug conspiracy.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.432
They were more often
at the very, very bottom,

08:21.468 --> 08:24.802
<i>because they were being
abused by the head honcho.</i>

08:24.837 --> 08:28.172
So, a woman gets
a very large sentence,

08:28.208 --> 08:31.708
because she's associated
with the drugs in some way.

08:31.743 --> 08:34.443
<i>She could not cooperate against</i>

08:34.480 --> 08:37.679
<i>the man on the rung above her.</i>

08:37.716 --> 08:39.448
It... it...

08:39.485 --> 08:42.018
It is... It's a criminal
justice policy

08:42.053 --> 08:44.954
that was, sort of, profoundly,
profoundly irrational,

08:44.990 --> 08:47.723
and it was very difficult
to be a judge

08:47.758 --> 08:50.058
meting out these sentences

08:50.094 --> 08:51.927
when you wanted to say
something different.

08:51.962 --> 08:55.397
Yeung: <i>Because of these pervasive
mandatory minimum guidelines,</i>

08:55.433 --> 08:58.567
<i>one of which was reinstated
in Indiana in 2016</i>

08:58.603 --> 09:00.469
<i>by then-governor Mike Pence,</i>

09:00.505 --> 09:03.439
<i>non-violent offenders end up
serving lengthy sentences</i>

09:03.474 --> 09:04.972
<i>in federal or state prisons.</i>

09:05.008 --> 09:07.942
We're here in Indianapolis
at the Indiana Women's Prison,

09:07.977 --> 09:11.346
which is actually the oldest
women's facility in the country.

09:11.381 --> 09:14.048
It's currently running
at pretty much full capacity,

09:14.083 --> 09:16.917
so we're gonna head in
and meet some of the offenders.

09:18.988 --> 09:20.921
All right.

09:49.384 --> 09:52.185
Yeung: <i>With so many crimes
revolving around drugs,</i>

09:52.220 --> 09:53.852
<i>the effects of
mandatory minimums</i>

09:53.888 --> 09:56.087
<i>are felt throughout
the facility.</i>

09:56.122 --> 09:58.490
Do you mind me asking what
your sentence is for?

09:58.525 --> 10:01.125
Uh, manufacturing
meth, dealing meth,

10:01.161 --> 10:02.894
and I get a total of 58 years.

10:02.929 --> 10:05.163
- 58 years?
- Yeah.

10:05.199 --> 10:08.066
- That's what your original
sentence was for or...? Yeah.

10:08.101 --> 10:11.135
I have more time than
some people here for murder.

10:11.171 --> 10:14.538
I have more years than they
do in... in total amount.

10:16.442 --> 10:18.509
Yeung: <i>Resigned to long
periods of time behind bars,</i>

10:18.544 --> 10:20.211
<i>women make do
with what they can.</i>

10:20.246 --> 10:23.714
Yeung: So these are cards that people have
sent you? Charissa: These are cards, yeah.

10:25.518 --> 10:28.018
It's girly!

10:28.053 --> 10:30.086
Yeung: What other kind
of stuff do you get?

10:30.121 --> 10:32.689
Well, we make hairspray
with Jolly Ranchers.

10:37.495 --> 10:39.929
I just... Yeah.
You made it yourself?

10:39.964 --> 10:42.365
Yeung: Is it easy to get
hold of tampons and stuff?

10:52.610 --> 10:53.775
That works?

10:56.046 --> 11:00.682
Alright, ladies, this is a
stand-up or sit-down count!

11:00.718 --> 11:03.751
Yeung: <i>But feminine hygiene
barely scratches the surface</i>

11:03.786 --> 11:05.620
<i>of the inmates' concerns.</i>

11:19.835 --> 11:22.269
Yeung: <i>Over 70% of
incarcerated women</i>

11:22.304 --> 11:23.670
<i>suffer from mental illness,</i>

11:23.705 --> 11:26.873
<i>and with inadequate mental
health resources inside prisons,</i>

11:26.908 --> 11:28.408
<i>the solitary confinement unit</i>

11:28.443 --> 11:31.110
<i>is becoming a De facto
mental hospital.</i>

11:47.695 --> 11:51.863
So, we're just walking along
the restrictive housing unit,

11:51.899 --> 11:54.699
which houses about
25 women here.

11:54.734 --> 11:58.002
You can see two women out
here are on suicide watch.

11:58.037 --> 12:01.439
These women are on
four-hour shift rotations,

12:01.474 --> 12:04.241
and they're checking in
every few minutes

12:04.277 --> 12:07.111
to check that no one
has killed themselves.

12:07.146 --> 12:10.281
Yeung: <i>For officers
like Lieutenant Spells,</i>

12:10.317 --> 12:11.748
<i>guarding mentally ill women</i>

12:11.784 --> 12:14.518
<i>has become a major part of
their responsibilities.</i>

12:14.553 --> 12:18.888
How many of the women here are
suffering from mental health problems?

12:21.527 --> 12:23.059
Pretty much gonna
be all of them.

12:23.094 --> 12:24.994
This unit holds 25.

12:25.030 --> 12:28.064
I've been here
for a while, 18 years.

12:28.099 --> 12:30.766
At one time, we used to have just,
maybe, like a couple of 'em.

12:30.802 --> 12:32.835
But the ones that's
coming in here,

12:32.870 --> 12:34.169
you know, throughout the years,

12:34.205 --> 12:35.838
- is more mental issues.
- Mm-hmm.

12:35.873 --> 12:38.307
Yeung: What's the hardest
part about your job?

12:38.343 --> 12:40.275
A lot of times they have kids.

12:40.311 --> 12:42.144
Then, you know, when
they come in to visit,

12:42.179 --> 12:44.513
the kids are crying, and...

12:44.549 --> 12:47.081
I just really feel
sorry for the kids.

12:48.952 --> 12:52.787
Yeung: <i>Around 60% of women in
state prisons are mothers.</i>

12:52.823 --> 12:55.156
<i>Some of whom enter the
system while pregnant.</i>

12:57.060 --> 12:59.126
<i>Charissa didn't know
she was pregnant</i>

12:59.162 --> 13:01.429
<i>when, she says,
she violated her parole</i>

13:01.465 --> 13:03.697
<i>by smoking marijuana.</i>

13:03.733 --> 13:06.333
<i>Now, she's facing
the sobering reality</i>

13:06.369 --> 13:08.168
<i>of giving birth behind bars.</i>

13:08.203 --> 13:10.871
Can you talk me through the
process of what happens

13:10.906 --> 13:12.373
when you go to give birth?

13:12.408 --> 13:15.075
I know that I can only stay
24 hours with my baby.

13:15.110 --> 13:16.943
Once you're there for 24 hours,

13:16.979 --> 13:19.379
the family... or whoever
you have, the caregiver...

13:19.414 --> 13:20.880
- will pick up the baby.
- Mm-hmm.

13:20.915 --> 13:23.449
What do you think that's gonna
be like coming back here

13:23.485 --> 13:26.051
to the prison after 24
hours, after given birth?

13:26.087 --> 13:28.921
It's gonna be...
I'm gonna be a mess.

13:28.956 --> 13:32.358
Not being able to have
that bond with my kid,

13:32.394 --> 13:35.461
and having somebody else
take care of my baby.

13:35.497 --> 13:37.596
Yeung: <i>Though Charissa
didn't qualify,</i>

13:37.631 --> 13:40.766
<i>Indiana does run one of a
few programs in the country</i>

13:40.801 --> 13:42.801
<i>that allows select
non-violent offenders</i>

13:42.836 --> 13:45.136
<i>to keep their newborns
in prison with them</i>

13:45.171 --> 13:47.305
<i>for a period of up to 18 months.</i>

13:47.340 --> 13:50.174
How old is she?
She is nine months.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.843
Yeung: You were in here
when you gave birth?

13:51.879 --> 13:54.144
Yes, I went to the hospital,

13:54.179 --> 13:56.714
and I had to have a emergency
C-section with her,

13:56.749 --> 13:58.215
because I went early with her,

13:58.250 --> 14:01.184
<i>so, she's my
little early-comer.</i>

14:01.220 --> 14:02.820
Yeung: <i>And how was that,
giving birth there?</i>

14:02.855 --> 14:05.756
We was handcuffed
to the bed by just one arm

14:05.792 --> 14:07.625
when the C-section
was happening,

14:07.660 --> 14:10.527
and your legs are
shackled to the bed.

14:10.562 --> 14:12.495
Whilst the C-section's
happening? That's...

14:12.531 --> 14:14.664
- Yeah. Like that's the point
when you're gonna run away.

14:14.699 --> 14:16.800
I know, right!

14:16.835 --> 14:18.301
Yeah!

14:18.336 --> 14:20.102
It's tough. It's tough...

14:20.138 --> 14:21.270
but it's worth it.

14:21.306 --> 14:25.442
Stephanie: <i>I can't imagine...
having my baby,</i>

14:25.477 --> 14:27.876
<i>and then the next day,
giving her up.</i>

14:27.912 --> 14:29.244
Some people don't have families,

14:29.279 --> 14:31.480
so they have to give it to...

14:31.515 --> 14:32.714
foster care.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.516
You know, you don't
know them people.

14:34.552 --> 14:36.251
You don't know who's
taking care of your child.

14:36.286 --> 14:40.722
Yeung: <i>In fact, incarcerated mothers
with children in foster care</i>

14:40.758 --> 14:42.390
<i>risk losing them permanently,</i>

14:42.426 --> 14:45.726
<i>because of a law called the
Adoption and Safe Families Act.</i>

14:45.762 --> 14:48.763
<i>It stipulates that any parent
with a child in foster care</i>

14:48.798 --> 14:50.965
<i>for 15 out of 22 months</i>

14:51.000 --> 14:53.267
<i>loses permanent custody.</i>

14:55.071 --> 14:58.272
<i>But the vast majority of primary
caregivers are mothers.</i>

14:59.542 --> 15:01.275
<i>This leaves women, like Nakita,</i>

15:01.310 --> 15:02.542
<i>in a race against time</i>

15:02.578 --> 15:05.445
<i>to retain their parental rights.</i>

15:05.481 --> 15:08.114
Oh, he's so handsome! That's
him when he was younger.

15:08.149 --> 15:10.249
This is all him up here?
Yeah, yeah.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.485
Uh-huh.
You must be happy.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.687
Yeung: <i> Nakita is serving the
remainder of her sentence</i>

15:13.722 --> 15:14.988
<i>in a halfway house,</i>

15:15.023 --> 15:17.557
<i>where she's allowed to leave
to go to and from work,</i>

15:17.593 --> 15:20.559
<i>but has limited access
to her son, Antonio.</i>

15:20.595 --> 15:22.060
Where's your son now?

15:22.096 --> 15:23.896
He's been in foster care

15:23.931 --> 15:27.065
since I turned myself in
in February.

15:27.101 --> 15:28.934
How's that been?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.136
Oh! Hmm.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.573
Me and my son ain't never been
separated from each other,

15:35.609 --> 15:37.809
so this is our first time.

15:37.844 --> 15:39.644
He don't understand it.

15:41.681 --> 15:45.216
All he know is
mommy's not there, and...

15:46.486 --> 15:48.152
we done had
an episode with my son

15:48.187 --> 15:50.622
trying to kill hisself,
because...

15:50.657 --> 15:52.023
he felt like...

15:52.058 --> 15:56.493
I left him, and... didn't
nobody want him, so...

15:58.196 --> 16:01.364
He was in a mental hospital
for about three weeks.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.935
And how old is he?
He'll be nine in October.

16:04.970 --> 16:06.937
If I don't get a early release,

16:06.972 --> 16:10.740
I will be here
until August 2017.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.644
So, whether or not
you get your son back

16:14.679 --> 16:17.346
depends on whether or not you
get an early release from here.

16:17.381 --> 16:18.447
Yeah.

16:19.884 --> 16:23.485
Yeung: <i> Like Nakita, most
incarcerated women are mothers,</i>

16:23.521 --> 16:26.255
<i>which leaves hundreds
of thousands of children</i>

16:26.290 --> 16:28.156
<i>without their primary caregivers</i>

16:28.191 --> 16:30.291
<i>and vulnerable
to the cycle itself.</i>

16:55.618 --> 16:57.284
Yeung: <i>What are the
legislations that you think</i>

16:57.319 --> 16:58.852
<i>need to be passed
on a national level</i>

16:58.888 --> 17:01.187
to address women who are
entering the justice system?

17:01.222 --> 17:03.556
Well, I think we need to get
rid of mandatory minimums.

17:03.592 --> 17:05.758
<i>I think we need to, um...</i>

17:05.794 --> 17:08.728
<i>increase resources in prisons.</i>

17:08.762 --> 17:11.430
I also think, because
of all of these years

17:11.465 --> 17:13.432
of mass incarceration,

17:13.468 --> 17:16.069
now our society needs to build

17:16.104 --> 17:18.368
an entire layer
of support services

17:18.405 --> 17:19.805
<i>for people when they come out,</i>

17:19.839 --> 17:21.506
<i>so that they
don't re-offend.</i>

17:22.375 --> 17:25.376
We are ones to clamor

17:25.412 --> 17:28.146
about human rights
in other countries,

17:28.181 --> 17:30.215
and I think we need to examine

17:30.250 --> 17:33.085
the human rights issue
right here in the United States,

17:33.120 --> 17:36.053
and I think we should
start with our prison system.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.390
Art has become one

17:40.426 --> 17:42.927
of the hottest commodities
on the planet.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.461
International art sales

17:44.497 --> 17:47.431
topped $45 billion
last year alone.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.466
<i>And high-end works
consistently</i>

17:49.502 --> 17:51.335
<i>have seen better
long-term results</i>

17:51.370 --> 17:53.703
<i>than investments
like gold or silver.</i>

17:53.739 --> 17:58.008
Reporter: <i>Picasso's</i> "Le Reve"
<i>sold for $155 million.</i>

17:58.043 --> 17:59.342
<i>Up over 200%.</i>

17:59.377 --> 18:00.677
Smith:
<i>But all of that value,</i>

18:00.712 --> 18:02.478
depends on whether
the work itself

18:02.514 --> 18:04.347
can be verified as genuine,

18:04.382 --> 18:07.651
<i>and in the case of prolific
artists like Andy Warhol,</i>

18:07.686 --> 18:10.418
<i>determining which pieces
are real and which are fake,</i>

18:10.454 --> 18:12.320
is a controversial decision

18:12.356 --> 18:13.756
that could be worth millions.

18:17.728 --> 18:18.761
Anderson:
<i>In the 1960s,</i>

18:18.796 --> 18:21.596
<i>Andy Warhol changed
the very definition of art</i>

18:21.632 --> 18:23.265
<i>and what it means
to be an artist.</i>

18:23.300 --> 18:25.800
Reporter: <i> Andy, a Canadian
government spokesman said,</i>

18:25.835 --> 18:28.069
that your art could
not be described

18:28.104 --> 18:29.603
as original sculpture.

18:29.639 --> 18:31.505
- Would you agree with that?
- Uh, yes.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.808
Reporter: <i>Why not
create something new?</i>

18:33.843 --> 18:36.343
Uh, because it's easier to do.

18:36.379 --> 18:38.146
Anderson:
<i>Warhol's methods...</i>

18:38.181 --> 18:39.613
<i>removing the artist's hand</i>

18:39.649 --> 18:41.816
<i>and industrializing
the creative process...</i>

18:41.851 --> 18:43.483
<i>was revolutionary.</i>

18:43.518 --> 18:46.553
<i>I spoke to Warhol's close
friend, Joe Simon-Whelan,</i>

18:46.588 --> 18:47.854
<i>about Andy's world.</i>

18:47.890 --> 18:50.623
By the time I met him, everything
was moving so fast for him.

18:50.659 --> 18:52.392
<i>I mean, he was turning
out a film a week.</i>

18:52.427 --> 18:54.227
<i>He was managing
Velvet Underground.</i>

18:54.262 --> 18:56.296
<i>He wasn't so much into painting.</i>

18:56.331 --> 18:59.999
<i>The concept of the...
of the piece, he liked,</i>

19:00.034 --> 19:01.834
but the actual making of it,
he didn't like,

19:01.869 --> 19:05.270
<i>and, um, he was very open
to having others make the work.</i>

19:05.306 --> 19:07.239
He used to call it
"art by telephone."

19:07.274 --> 19:09.575
He would call his
off-site ventures,

19:09.610 --> 19:12.244
and say, "Okay, I need,
you know, ten of these."

19:12.279 --> 19:14.013
They would make ten,
give 'em to Andy,

19:14.048 --> 19:15.715
then he would roll 'em
out for the client,

19:15.750 --> 19:17.882
and say, "Whoo!<i> Voila,</i>
they're all made."

19:17.918 --> 19:19.417
Meanwhile, downtown...

19:19.452 --> 19:22.887
they're just, you know,
just drinking whiskey,

19:22.923 --> 19:25.156
doing whatever they're doing.
Making extra prints.

19:25.192 --> 19:27.792
Don't you think he would have liked
the idea that there could have been

19:27.828 --> 19:29.293
thousands of these prints made,

19:29.329 --> 19:31.662
and maybe even prints made,
you know, after his death.

19:31.698 --> 19:33.564
Actually, he...
he would have liked it,

19:33.600 --> 19:36.533
but his... certainly his dealers
and his salespeople didn't.

19:36.568 --> 19:39.136
Anderson: <i>When Joe got the
chance to buy his own Warhol,</i>

19:39.171 --> 19:40.470
<i>he was positive it was real.</i>

19:40.505 --> 19:43.506
Simon-Whelan: The reason I bought
my painting after Andy died

19:43.542 --> 19:44.641
is cause I thought it was

19:44.676 --> 19:46.710
<i>authenticated by the
executor of his estate.</i>

19:46.746 --> 19:49.379
<i>It's on the cover of the
catalogue raisonné of 1970,</i>

19:49.414 --> 19:51.881
<i>which pretty much
covered all of Warhol's work,</i>

19:51.916 --> 19:54.583
so I thought, "Great,
providence, wonderful work."

19:54.619 --> 19:56.719
Anderson: <i>Joe's friend
and art dealer,</i>

19:56.755 --> 19:59.355
<i>Michael Hue-Williams,
arranged the sale.</i>

19:59.390 --> 20:01.257
In the case of the
"Red Self Portraits,"

20:01.292 --> 20:04.127
<i>I sold that painting
to Joe Simon.</i>

20:04.162 --> 20:09.097
It had a hand-written authentification
on it by Fred Hughes.

20:09.133 --> 20:13.568
Written at a time when Fred
was the only authority.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.637
He was the sole executor
of Andy's estate.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.240
I asked Fred about the painting,

20:18.275 --> 20:21.342
and he said, "Yes, but I've already
written on the back of the painting.

20:21.378 --> 20:22.410
It is a Warhol."

20:22.445 --> 20:24.879
For me, that's it.
That's the end of the story.

20:24.914 --> 20:28.215
Anderson: <i> After owning his "Red
Self Portrait" for 12 years,</i>

20:28.251 --> 20:30.184
<i>Joe decided to sell it,</i>

20:30.219 --> 20:32.286
<i>but first he was required
to get it verified</i>

20:32.321 --> 20:35.089
<i>by the Warhol Foundation's
Authentication Board.</i>

20:35.124 --> 20:38.826
So, you submitted the
painting for authentication?

20:38.861 --> 20:41.195
And what happened
to the painting then?

20:41.230 --> 20:44.430
Well, it came back with this
nasty stamp on the back,

20:44.465 --> 20:46.132
saying "Denied.

20:46.168 --> 20:47.767
This is not by Andy Warhol."

20:47.803 --> 20:49.803
Sorry, they stamped
the word "Denied"

20:49.838 --> 20:51.004
with ink onto the painting?

20:51.039 --> 20:53.807
The back of the painting? Which
seeped through the picture.

20:53.842 --> 20:55.108
It was very naughty.

20:55.143 --> 20:56.709
So what do you think decides

20:56.744 --> 20:59.544
which pieces get authenticated
and which get denied?

20:59.579 --> 21:01.746
Whatever makes the most money.

21:01.782 --> 21:06.051
Anderson: <i>At some point, you had
to step down from the battle.</i>

21:06.086 --> 21:08.386
You know, they said, publicly,

21:08.422 --> 21:09.922
"We won't stop."

21:09.957 --> 21:12.958
Simon-Whelan: <i>This is like a beast
that's just rolling upon itself.</i>

21:12.993 --> 21:14.693
<i>I mean, it's a...
it's a commodity,</i>

21:14.728 --> 21:17.161
<i>and people don't want
to see it collapse,</i>

21:17.197 --> 21:19.931
so people will protect that.

21:19.966 --> 21:21.899
Anderson: <i>This battle
was a direct result</i>

21:21.935 --> 21:24.468
<i>of Warhol's own process,
limiting the role</i>

21:24.503 --> 21:25.970
<i>of the artist in the
making of the art.</i>

21:26.005 --> 21:30.208
<i>As Warhol's work became some of
the most expensive in the world,</i>

21:30.243 --> 21:33.376
<i>the stakes of authentication
increased drastically.</i>

21:33.411 --> 21:35.846
<i>I met with British artist,
Paul Stephenson,</i>

21:35.881 --> 21:37.247
<i>and leading art market analyst,</i>

21:37.282 --> 21:39.482
<i>Marion Maneker, to discuss this.</i>

21:39.517 --> 21:42.685
Many people date the
current art market

21:42.721 --> 21:44.054
<i>from 1998,</i>

21:44.089 --> 21:48.091
<i>when the "Orange Marilyn"
was sold at auction</i>

21:48.126 --> 21:49.359
<i>for a record price.</i>

21:49.394 --> 21:53.095
That sort of woke up the world
to the value of these works.

21:53.130 --> 21:55.030
The first phase
of this market run-up

21:55.066 --> 21:57.699
from about 2004 to 2007,

21:57.735 --> 21:59.534
Warhol led the way.

21:59.570 --> 22:01.636
Maneker:
<i>There are buyers in Asia.</i>

22:01.672 --> 22:03.405
<i>There are buyers
in South America.</i>

22:03.440 --> 22:06.441
<i>There are buyers
in the gulf states.</i>

22:06.477 --> 22:09.543
It has an appeal that
very few other artists do.

22:09.579 --> 22:12.146
Warhol was the first artist
who was talking about

22:12.182 --> 22:14.215
what makes a Warhol,
his own authenticity.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.717
And that's one of the issues
with the art market.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.952
Are these actual works?

22:17.988 --> 22:21.822
Or are these copies because he
wasn't there to approve them?

22:21.858 --> 22:24.024
Anderson: <i>With individual
Warhol's now selling</i>

22:24.059 --> 22:25.592
<i>in the tens of millions,</i>

22:25.627 --> 22:26.960
<i>we asked Donald Sheridan,</i>

22:26.996 --> 22:29.096
<i>who made many of the
artist's prints,</i>

22:29.131 --> 22:31.298
<i>what makes a real Warhol.</i>

22:31.333 --> 22:32.799
These are the
Retrospective Series.

22:32.834 --> 22:36.336
So they're Warhol revisiting
his most iconic images.

22:36.372 --> 22:39.672
Anderson: <i>Who decided that the
acetates would be in those positions?</i>

22:39.708 --> 22:41.440
You know, anybody
who was working there,

22:41.475 --> 22:44.743
we were basically
allowed to play.

22:44.779 --> 22:46.545
Anderson:
<i>He didn't take the picture.</i>

22:46.580 --> 22:47.813
<i>He didn't choose
this color scheme.</i>

22:47.848 --> 22:49.382
<i>You decided the composition,</i>

22:49.417 --> 22:51.017
and then you guys printed it...

22:51.052 --> 22:52.218
- on your own?
- Yeah.

22:52.253 --> 22:55.021
- That could still be a Warhol?
- Oh, yeah.

22:55.056 --> 22:57.423
He knew it was
gonna be a Warhol,

22:57.458 --> 22:58.890
Andy did, you know.

22:58.926 --> 23:01.426
He knew that we could
give him good Warhols.

23:01.461 --> 23:03.128
"Just make it pretty."

23:03.163 --> 23:04.195
And you gave good Warhol?

23:04.231 --> 23:06.231
Yes.

23:08.468 --> 23:09.867
Anderson:
<i>Because Warhol wasn't there</i>

23:09.903 --> 23:11.436
<i>when many of his works
were made,</i>

23:11.471 --> 23:13.204
<i>we wanted to see
if we could make a Warhol</i>

23:13.240 --> 23:15.439
<i>30 years after
the artist's death,</i>

23:15.474 --> 23:16.540
<i>using the original acetates</i>

23:16.575 --> 23:19.343
<i>that were used in some
of his most iconic works.</i>

23:19.378 --> 23:21.812
Stephenson: <i>Warhol's
"Jackie" was a photograph</i>

23:21.847 --> 23:24.614
<i>taken by Jacques Lowe
in Hyannis Port,</i>

23:24.650 --> 23:26.417
<i>then appropriated by Warhol,</i>

23:26.452 --> 23:29.119
<i>and then he had it enlarged
into this size acetate.</i>

23:29.155 --> 23:31.488
At that point, he worked
on this acetate by hand,

23:31.523 --> 23:33.556
adapted it, made it

23:33.591 --> 23:35.291
the way he wanted to make it.

23:35.327 --> 23:36.926
You can still
see actually, just...

23:36.962 --> 23:40.229
here on the sides, her hair
flicks up quite a way out.

23:40.265 --> 23:42.131
Warhol's cut it right down in.

23:42.167 --> 23:43.166
In producing these acetates,

23:43.201 --> 23:45.301
and then, blacking out
bits of them, that's...

23:45.337 --> 23:46.902
that's the only stage
where he's actually

23:46.938 --> 23:48.938
physically involved in...
in the process.

23:48.973 --> 23:52.040
- Wow.
- In terms of this image, yeah.

23:52.076 --> 23:53.608
How much do these sell for now?

23:53.643 --> 23:57.379
If a 40-by-40-inch "Jackie"
came up for sale today...

23:57.414 --> 24:00.382
$40 million plus.

24:00.417 --> 24:01.916
This is probably in excess

24:01.952 --> 24:04.786
of 200 or $300 million worth

24:04.821 --> 24:06.887
of paintings that you
could make with these.

24:06.922 --> 24:09.656
Stephenson: So, he'd put
the small acetate on here,

24:09.692 --> 24:11.959
this light shines
through the acetate,

24:11.995 --> 24:13.160
<i>through this lens</i>

24:13.196 --> 24:14.595
<i>and into the other room</i>

24:14.630 --> 24:16.464
<i>where he'd make it
the correct size.</i>

24:16.499 --> 24:18.265
Anderson: <i>The lab is one
of the last in the world</i>

24:18.301 --> 24:20.701
<i>still able to carry out
the exact same process</i>

24:20.736 --> 24:22.803
<i>Warhol's printers employed.</i>

24:27.542 --> 24:28.741
<i>In East London,</i>

24:28.776 --> 24:31.244
<i>Paul has also managed to track
down the exact same paint</i>

24:31.279 --> 24:33.179
<i>that Warhol used
for his background.</i>

24:33.215 --> 24:36.749
<i>It was so old it was
about to get thrown out.</i>

24:36.784 --> 24:39.486
<i>It was on sale at half price.</i>

24:39.521 --> 24:43.722
Naphthol Red is, uh,
the lips on a "Marilyn."

24:43.757 --> 24:45.090
This is Chairman Mao's face.

24:45.126 --> 24:47.659
Stephenson:
<i>Yellow-Yellow Orange Azo.</i>

24:47.694 --> 24:50.962
Um, and this is late
'70s Acro-Violet,

24:50.998 --> 24:54.099
which is the face color
for Jackie O.

24:54.135 --> 24:56.035
<i>Marilyn,
all the self-portraits.</i>

24:56.070 --> 24:58.369
This has got
"Copyright 1980" on it, so...

24:58.405 --> 25:01.339
this was a kind of a cool thing to find,
cause they don't make that anymore.

25:01.374 --> 25:04.075
There's only a limited amount of
this... this stuff left that was made.

25:04.110 --> 25:05.910
This might be the last pot of...

25:05.945 --> 25:07.478
of Acro-Violet
left in the world.

25:09.582 --> 25:11.649
<i>Is one of Warhol's
original printers.</i>

25:11.684 --> 25:15.685
<i>Alexander Heinrici now
works in Bushwick, Brooklyn.</i>

25:15.720 --> 25:18.721
<i>He was Warhol's primary
silk-screen printer</i>

25:18.757 --> 25:21.024
<i>from 1974 to '76.</i>

25:21.060 --> 25:24.127
I saw him almost every day
when I worked with him.

25:24.163 --> 25:27.564
And what do you think of, like,
the Warhol idea of... of...

25:27.599 --> 25:31.034
almost removing the hand of the
artist from... from the process.

25:31.069 --> 25:33.235
Oh, he totally
changed everything.

25:33.271 --> 25:36.539
I mean, that...
that's his, uh, forte.

25:36.574 --> 25:37.639
I mean, that's what he did.

25:37.675 --> 25:40.576
I was just lucky to be his
silk-screen printer, you know?

25:40.611 --> 25:42.411
At the time.
Yeah, yeah.

25:42.447 --> 25:43.946
Anderson:
Can you explain that?

25:43.981 --> 25:45.681
Like, exactly what's
happening now?

25:45.716 --> 25:48.483
Heinrici: <i>Well, the screen
is coated with emulsion,</i>

25:48.518 --> 25:50.017
<i>which is photo sensitive.</i>

25:50.053 --> 25:51.752
<i>We put the positive on,</i>

25:51.788 --> 25:55.623
<i>and then we expose it
with ultra-violet light</i>

25:55.658 --> 25:58.793
that will harden the emulsion
where the light hits it,

25:58.828 --> 26:01.796
<i>and leave it soft
where it doesn't.</i>

26:01.831 --> 26:04.199
<i>The emulsion breaks
out where it's soft,</i>

26:04.234 --> 26:06.333
and stays where it's hard.

26:06.368 --> 26:09.203
Is this exactly the same as the
process that you did back then?

26:09.238 --> 26:10.270
Yeah.

26:17.279 --> 26:19.646
Okay, let's go.

26:28.055 --> 26:30.055
You got it? Over here.

26:38.766 --> 26:40.832
This looks like Warhol now.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:44.004 --> 26:45.437
Well, we're learning, right?

26:45.472 --> 26:48.507
Not many more years,
and we'll be pros.

27:02.555 --> 27:04.555
Anderson: <i>We showed
it to Rainer Crone,</i>

27:04.590 --> 27:06.123
<i>who was the world's
leading Warhol scholar,</i>

27:06.159 --> 27:08.459
<i>and author of Andy's first</i>
catalogue raisonné.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.796
Crone:
Whoa! That's incredible.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.764
That's how you wanted
to surprise me.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.633
Wow.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.069
Beautiful, no?

27:21.373 --> 27:22.405
Fantastic.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.006
Same acetate,

27:24.042 --> 27:25.975
same printer, Alex Heinrici,

27:26.010 --> 27:27.109
same everything.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.978
In your mind, are these...

27:29.013 --> 27:30.879
you know, how close
are these to Warhol's?

27:30.914 --> 27:32.814
They are fan...
this is fantastic.

27:32.849 --> 27:34.583
Yeah. What do you think
Andy would have made

27:34.618 --> 27:37.286
of the idea of recreating these

27:37.321 --> 27:39.354
decades after his death?
It's good! Good!

27:39.390 --> 27:42.424
It's in his concept,

27:42.459 --> 27:43.525
in his traditions.

27:43.561 --> 27:44.926
So, he has the idea,

27:44.961 --> 27:46.562
- and then anybody can make them?
- Yeah.

27:46.597 --> 27:47.961
- As many prints as they want?
- Yes.

27:47.997 --> 27:49.530
That's what he wanted.

27:49.566 --> 27:51.332
Anderson:
<i>Since the Warhol controversy,</i>

27:51.367 --> 27:54.868
<i>numerous other artists have their
own issues with authentication.</i>

27:54.904 --> 27:55.736
<i>Two of the biggest galleries</i>

27:55.771 --> 27:57.871
<i>have been fooled
with older works.</i>

27:57.907 --> 28:01.175
<i>Sotheby's admitted that two
paintings worth over $10 million</i>

28:01.211 --> 28:03.911
<i>they'd authenticated
and sold were fake.</i>

28:03.946 --> 28:07.447
<i>The Guggenheim had to do the same
with a painting in its collection.</i>

28:07.482 --> 28:09.015
<i>After its legal battle,</i>

28:09.050 --> 28:11.851
<i>the Warhol Foundation disbanded
its Authentication Board</i>

28:11.886 --> 28:15.021
<i>leaving hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of Warhol's in doubt.</i>

28:16.391 --> 28:19.726
Markets like gold and art
are about confidence.

28:19.761 --> 28:21.727
You buy something
with the hope that

28:21.762 --> 28:23.462
you'll be able to resell it.

28:23.497 --> 28:26.432
And the real question
of its value is your confidence

28:26.467 --> 28:28.066
that there are other
buyers behind you.

28:28.102 --> 28:31.303
One of the things that
the art world needs

28:31.339 --> 28:34.106
is a better system
for people to be able to say,

28:34.141 --> 28:35.307
"Yes, this is real."
