WEBVTT

00:29.404 --> 00:31.864
Read the charges.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.491
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,

00:34.534 --> 00:37.870
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defense Industries,

00:37.912 --> 00:40.372
you stand before this council

00:40.415 --> 00:45.461
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.510
How do you plead?

00:53.553 --> 00:55.054
Not guilty!

00:55.096 --> 01:00.684
My experiments are only theoretical,
completely within legal boundaries.

01:00.727 --> 01:05.063
We believe you actually
created something.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.399
Created something?

01:07.442 --> 01:11.195
But that would be
irresponsible and unethical.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.405
I would never, ever,

01:14.949 --> 01:16.742
make more than one.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.668
What is that monstrosity?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.462
Monstrosity?

01:28.546 --> 01:33.467
What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

01:33.551 --> 01:37.471
I call it Experiment 626.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.350
He is bulletproof, fireproof

01:41.434 --> 01:44.103
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

01:44.187 --> 01:49.233
He can see in the dark
and move objects 3,000 times his size.

01:49.275 --> 01:54.279
His only instinct,
to destroy everything he touches!

01:56.282 --> 01:58.033
So it is a monster.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.368
Hey, just a little one.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.663
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!

02:02.747 --> 02:07.459
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

02:07.502 --> 02:13.799
Experiment 626, give us some sign
you understand any of this.

02:13.883 --> 02:18.470
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.648
So naughty!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.819
I didn't teach it that.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.655
Place that idiot scientist under arrest!

02:37.448 --> 02:41.535
I prefer to be called "evil genius"!

02:41.619 --> 02:44.163
And as for that abomination,

02:44.247 --> 02:48.000
it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.210
It has no place among us.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.463
Captain Gantu, take him away.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.382
With pleasure.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.863
Uncomfortable?

03:17.906 --> 03:20.199
Good!

03:20.241 --> 03:24.453
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.623
So relax, enjoy the trip,

03:27.707 --> 03:30.042
and don't get any ideas.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.503
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.381
They won't shoot anyone but you.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.800
Why, you...

03:39.510 --> 03:42.554
May I remind the Captain
that he is on duty?

03:44.515 --> 03:45.724
Secure the cell!

03:45.767 --> 03:47.309
Aye, Captain.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.481
Captain on deck.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.651
All ahead full.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.866
Does this look infected to you?

04:31.604 --> 04:32.980
Quiet, you.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.902
- Gunfire in the cell bay!
- Open a channel.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.747
He's loose on Deck C!

04:50.790 --> 04:52.040
Red alert. Seal off the deck!

05:00.508 --> 05:02.426
Security, converge on Door 7!

05:02.468 --> 05:07.097
Deadly force authorized. Fire on sight!
Fire on sight!

05:07.140 --> 05:08.598
There he is!

05:13.146 --> 05:14.313
Security to Bridge.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.648
It's in the ventilation system.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.487
He's headed for the power grid.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.326
What was that?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.828
I don't think he's on the ship anymore.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.205
Confirmed. He's taken a police cruiser.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.543
Yeah, he took the red one.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.360
That's it! We've got it. We've got it!

06:04.739 --> 06:07.532
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.659
He's engaged his H-drive!

06:09.702 --> 06:12.037
Warning, guidance is not functional.

06:12.121 --> 06:15.040
Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog
is about to make a jump!

06:15.124 --> 06:17.626
Break formation! Get clear of that ship!

06:17.710 --> 06:21.671
Navigation failure. Do not engage...

06:31.307 --> 06:33.392
Get me Galactic Control.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.561
Where is he?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.063
He's still in hyperspace.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.398
Where will he exit?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.732
Calculating now.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.903
Quadrant 17, section 005, area 51.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.572
A planet called Ee-arth.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.534
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!

06:52.370 --> 06:53.412
What is that?

06:53.454 --> 06:55.330
Water. Most of the planet is
covered in it.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.251
He won't survive in water.
His molecular density is too great.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.173
No.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.721
Of course.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.266
How much time do we have?

07:14.308 --> 07:17.936
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.688
We have to gas the planet.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.983
Hold it! Hold everything!

07:23.067 --> 07:25.777
Earth is a protected wildlife reserve.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.989
Yeah. We've been using it
to rebuild the mosquito population,

07:29.073 --> 07:32.367
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

07:32.452 --> 07:35.245
Am I to assume you are the expert?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.622
I don't know about "expert."

07:39.959 --> 07:41.710
Agent Pleakley at your service.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.545
Can we not simply destroy the island?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.338
No! Crazy head!

07:45.423 --> 07:48.633
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms,

07:48.676 --> 07:51.303
have colonies all over that planet.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.637
Are they intelligent?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.140
No, but they're very delicate.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.267
In fact, every time an asteroid strikes
their planet,

07:57.310 --> 08:00.145
they have to begin life all over.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.898
It's fascinating, isn't it?
With this, I've been able to study...

08:02.982 --> 08:05.984
What if our military forces
just landed there?

08:06.068 --> 08:07.694
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

08:07.778 --> 08:10.906
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.992
Landing there would create
mass mayhem and planet-wide panic!

08:14.076 --> 08:17.037
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 626

08:17.121 --> 08:18.622
that we do not possess.

08:18.664 --> 08:23.084
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley,
would you send for his extraction?

08:24.629 --> 08:26.546
Does he have a brother?

08:27.548 --> 08:28.882
Close grandmother, perhaps?

08:32.803 --> 08:34.763
Friendly cousin?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.722
Neighbor with a beard?

08:58.663 --> 08:59.871
He got away?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.374
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.877
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.672
Which is precisely why
you must now bring him back.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.048
What, me?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.050
And to reward you,

09:12.093 --> 09:16.888
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.227
626 will not come easily.

09:22.270 --> 09:26.481
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon
might stun him long enough to...

09:26.566 --> 09:30.277
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

09:31.862 --> 09:35.991
But it's a delicate planet!
Who's going to control him?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.951
You will.

09:38.035 --> 09:41.454
Very good, Your Highness.
I didn't quite...

09:41.539 --> 09:42.581
You're not joking!

09:42.623 --> 09:46.793
So, tell me, my little one-eyed one,

09:46.877 --> 09:51.548
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet

09:52.008 --> 09:57.095
has my monstrosity been unleashed?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.412
Stop. Stop.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.957
Lilo, why are you all wet?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.751
It's sandwich day.

12:35.546 --> 12:39.257
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish
a peanut-butter sandwich.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.759
Pudge is a fish?

12:40.801 --> 12:43.428
And today
we were out of peanut butter.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.891
So I asked my sister what to give him,
and she said a tuna sandwich.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.268
I can't give Pudge tuna!

12:50.352 --> 12:53.354
Do you know what tuna is?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.857
- Fish?
- It's fish!

12:55.941 --> 12:59.944
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

13:00.029 --> 13:02.113
I'm late because I had to go to the store

13:02.156 --> 13:06.242
and get peanut butter,
'cause all we have is stinking tuna!

13:06.285 --> 13:09.496
Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.664
Pudge controls the weather.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.585
You're crazy.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.256
Please! Please!

13:20.299 --> 13:23.301
Everybody calm down!

13:23.344 --> 13:24.469
Girls.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.682
- Lilo...
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

13:29.767 --> 13:31.226
I won't do it again!

13:31.310 --> 13:33.478
Maybe we should call your sister.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.981
No! I'll be good! I want to dance.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.067
I practiced.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.444
I just want to dance.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.196
I practiced.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.491
She bit me.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.501
I called your sister.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.420
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.507
We'll try again on Sunday.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.432
Does this look infected to you?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.600
Yeah.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.229
You better not have rabies.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.858
If you have rabies,
the dogcatcher is going to have to cut...

14:19.942 --> 14:22.652
Are you going to play dolls?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.196
You don't have a doll.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.198
This is Scrump.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.868
I made her, but her head is too big.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.371
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset,

14:33.455 --> 14:36.332
because she only has
a few more days to...

14:56.103 --> 14:57.228
Lilo!

14:58.314 --> 15:04.444
Lilo?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.322
Oh, no.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.743
You better be home.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.290
Hey! Watch where you're going!

15:17.958 --> 15:19.334
Stupid head!

15:28.469 --> 15:29.844
Lilo!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.430
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

15:32.514 --> 15:33.723
Go away.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.645
Lilo? We don't have time for this.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.689
Leave me alone to die.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.693
Come on, Lilo, that social worker's
going to be here any minute!

16:05.255 --> 16:08.174
You are so finished when I get in there!

16:13.555 --> 16:17.850
I'm going to stuff you in the blender,
push "purÃ©e," then bake you into a pie

16:17.935 --> 16:19.143
and feed it to the social worker!

16:19.228 --> 16:23.731
And when he says, "This is great.
What's your secret?" I'm going to say,

16:23.816 --> 16:27.402
"Love and nurturing."

16:28.028 --> 16:29.153
Hi.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.865
You must be the...

16:32.950 --> 16:34.283
The stupid head.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.080
You know, I'm really sorry about that,

16:39.164 --> 16:42.834
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

16:42.876 --> 16:43.960
I can pay for that.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.503
It's a rental.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.338
Are you the guardian in question?

16:47.381 --> 16:49.841
Yes. I'm Nani.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.343
Nice to meet you, Mister...

16:52.428 --> 16:53.469
Bubbles.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.680
Mr. Bubbles. That's a strange...

16:55.723 --> 16:56.931
Yes, I know.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.559
Are you going to invite me in, Nani?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.312
I thought we could sit out here and talk.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.356
I don't think so.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.566
Right.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.486
This way.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.540
Wait here.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.590
Hey!

17:32.760 --> 17:35.303
So, lemonade?

17:35.971 --> 17:38.347
Do you often leave
your sister home alone?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.682
No. Never.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.603
Well, except for just now.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.231
I had to run to the store to get some...

17:49.735 --> 17:52.445
You left the stove on
while you were out?

17:52.529 --> 17:54.530
Low heat! Just a simmer.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.992
It's coming along great.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.786
I found that this morning.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.996
Lilo! There you are.

18:02.081 --> 18:06.667
Honey face, this is Mr. Bubbles.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.419
Nice to meet you.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.588
Your knuckles say "Cobra."

18:13.926 --> 18:15.885
Cobra Bubbles.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.180
You don't look like a social worker.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.432
I'm a special classification.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.935
Did you ever kill anyone?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.605
We're getting off the subject.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.441
Let's talk about you. Are you happy?

18:33.695 --> 18:36.280
I'm adjusted. I eat four food groups

18:36.365 --> 18:38.866
and look both ways
before crossing the street

18:38.951 --> 18:42.787
and take long naps and get disciplined.

18:42.830 --> 18:43.955
Disciplined?

18:43.997 --> 18:48.417
Yeah. She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.002
- No.
- With bricks.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.629
Bricks?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.755
In a pillowcase.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.550
Okay! That's enough sugar for you.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.928
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.973
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.307
Thirsty?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.979
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

19:08.063 --> 19:10.356
in which you have found yourself.

19:11.358 --> 19:16.320
I am the one they call
when things go wrong,

19:16.363 --> 19:20.199
and things have indeed gone wrong.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.011
My friends need to be punished.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.143
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.394
Yep.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.690
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.861
You have three days
to change my mind.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.706
Lilo!

20:37.277 --> 20:38.819
Why didn't you wait at the school?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.738
You were supposed to wait there!

20:40.822 --> 20:42.198
Lilo!

20:42.241 --> 20:45.618
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.703
Answer me!

20:47.746 --> 20:49.830
- No!
- No, you don't understand?

20:49.915 --> 20:51.916
- No!
- No, what?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.751
No!

21:01.843 --> 21:03.928
You're such a pain!

21:04.012 --> 21:07.139
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?

21:07.224 --> 21:09.892
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!

21:09.935 --> 21:14.021
Go ahead! Then you'll be happy,
because it'll be smarter than me, too!

21:14.106 --> 21:15.940
And quieter!

21:15.983 --> 21:19.568
You'll like it, 'cause it's stinky, like you!

21:19.611 --> 21:21.946
Go to your room!

21:21.989 --> 21:24.282
I'm already in my room!

21:39.798 --> 21:40.881
Hey.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.553
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.140
We're a broken family, aren't we?

21:50.434 --> 21:51.642
No.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.062
Maybe a little.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.191
Maybe a lot.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.319
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.155
We're sisters. It's our job.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.157
Yeah, well, from now on...

22:06.199 --> 22:08.993
I like you better as a sister than a mom.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.662
Yeah?

22:11.747 --> 22:16.125
And you like me better as a sister
than a rabbit, right?

22:20.255 --> 22:21.630
Yes.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.591
Yes, I do.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.678
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.013
You hit her?

22:29.056 --> 22:30.681
Before I bit her.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.684
You bit her. Lilo, you shouldn't...

22:33.727 --> 22:35.728
People treat me different.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.899
They just don't know what to say.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.067
I'll tell you what.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.819
If you promise not to fight anymore,

22:43.862 --> 22:48.657
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.911
Tuesdays and bank holidays
would be good.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.996
Yeah? Would that be good?

22:54.873 --> 22:57.041
My camera's full again.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.919
Aren't they beautiful?

23:10.889 --> 23:12.390
A falling star!

23:16.770 --> 23:21.023
I call it! Get out! Get out!
I have to make a wish!

23:21.066 --> 23:22.983
Can't you go any faster?

23:23.068 --> 23:25.569
Oh, no! Gravity is increasing on me.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.987
No, it's not!

23:27.072 --> 23:29.949
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing happened yesterday.

23:30.033 --> 23:33.786
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!

23:33.870 --> 23:35.871
Why do you act so weird?

23:40.085 --> 23:41.669
It's me again.

23:42.421 --> 23:47.925
I need someone to be my friend,
someone who won't run away.

23:48.009 --> 23:53.389
Maybe send me an angel,
the nicest angel you have.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.147
What we when hit?

24:45.650 --> 24:48.569
There it is.
It stayed jammed under the fender.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.740
We better call somebody.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.676
We're looking for something
that can defend itself,

25:12.761 --> 25:16.305
something that won't die,
something sturdy, you know?

25:16.348 --> 25:17.556
Like a lobster.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.392
Lilo, you lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?

25:20.477 --> 25:23.145
No. We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.

25:28.652 --> 25:32.446
So nice to see your pretty face again!

25:32.531 --> 25:33.572
Jumba?

25:33.657 --> 25:37.076
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

25:39.037 --> 25:41.288
The kennel's back this way.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.123
Go. Pick someone out.

25:46.211 --> 25:51.131
Hello?

25:53.134 --> 25:55.469
Are there any "aminals" in here?

26:02.936 --> 26:04.144
Hello!

26:15.532 --> 26:19.243
Hi.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.079
Wow!

26:22.706 --> 26:25.916
Yes. All of our dogs are adoptable.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.085
Except that one!

26:28.128 --> 26:29.420
What is that thing?

26:29.462 --> 26:32.131
A dog, I think,
but it was dead this morning.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.757
It was dead this morning?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.427
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.096
I like him! Come here, boy.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.145
Wouldn't you like a different dog?

26:46.229 --> 26:48.439
We have better dogs, dear.

26:48.523 --> 26:52.192
Not better than him.
He can talk! Say hello.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.613
Dogs can't talk, dear.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.739
He did.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.199
Does it have to be this dog?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.831
Yes, he's good. I can tell.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.000
You'll have to think of a name for him.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.086
His name is Stitch.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.672
Now, that's not a real name

27:13.757 --> 27:17.384
in Iceland, but here it's a good name.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.927
Stitch it is.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.554
And there's a $2 license fee.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.306
I want to buy him!

27:22.349 --> 27:24.516
Can I borrow $2?

27:30.357 --> 27:31.982
He's all yours.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.652
You're all mine.

27:34.694 --> 27:35.903
Well, what's he doing?

27:35.987 --> 27:39.198
Keep quiet. He's listening for us.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.704
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...

27:52.212 --> 27:53.879
Why don't you run?

27:56.383 --> 27:57.966
Coming! I'm coming!

27:58.009 --> 27:59.259
Stop!

27:59.344 --> 28:03.097
I have just determined this situation
to be far too hazardous!

28:03.181 --> 28:04.682
Don't worry, I won't hit her.

28:04.724 --> 28:08.936
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.188
Here! Educate yourself.

28:12.315 --> 28:16.652
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low even for you!

28:20.365 --> 28:22.074
Tear him apart
with all both my bare hands!

28:22.158 --> 28:23.909
Have you lost your mind?

28:23.993 --> 28:25.703
What is it, Stitch?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.996
We cannot be seen!

28:28.873 --> 28:31.041
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

28:33.169 --> 28:36.380
You can't shoot, and you can't be seen.

28:36.423 --> 28:40.759
Look at you! You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.846
Okay, I got to get to work.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.515
Stick around town
and stay out of the roads, okay?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.392
I'll meet you at 1:00.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.903
Okay, I guess we should be going.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.906
What about Stitch?

29:09.789 --> 29:11.165
My friends!

29:15.253 --> 29:17.045
What do you want?

29:17.088 --> 29:22.050
I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your hair
and punched you in the face.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.219
Apology not accepted.

29:24.262 --> 29:27.181
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.559
I got a new dog. His name is Stitch.

29:30.602 --> 29:34.772
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.360
Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!

29:44.199 --> 29:46.116
Somebody do something!

29:46.201 --> 29:47.910
Oh, great! He's loose.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.537
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.457
He will be irresistibly drawn
to large cities

29:53.541 --> 29:55.083
where he will back up sewers,

29:55.126 --> 29:57.920
reverse street signs
and steal everyone's left shoe.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.150
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.489
Are you okay?

30:59.023 --> 31:01.149
Hey, over here, little buddy.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.731
When you're ready to give up,
just let us know.

31:44.068 --> 31:48.113
Yeah!

32:20.772 --> 32:21.939
This is you.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.651
This is your badness level.

32:25.735 --> 32:29.154
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

32:29.238 --> 32:30.697
We have to fix that.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.574
Lilo!

32:32.617 --> 32:34.618
Your dog cannot sit at the table.

32:34.702 --> 32:37.704
Stitch is troubled. He needs desserts.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.873
You didn't even eat your sweet potato.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.416
I thought you liked them.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.793
Desserts!

32:47.507 --> 32:49.007
David!

32:49.092 --> 32:50.801
I got a new dog.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.595
You sure it's a dog?

32:54.305 --> 32:57.391
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.521
Hey.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.489
How's it, Nani?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.617
Did you catch fire again?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.494
Nah, just the stage.

33:17.578 --> 33:21.373
Listen, I was wondering
if you're not doing anything this...

33:21.457 --> 33:24.543
David, I told you, I can't. I...

33:26.170 --> 33:28.005
I got a lot to deal with right now.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.424
I know. I just figured
you might need some time...

33:30.508 --> 33:32.634
You smell like a lawn mower.

33:34.470 --> 33:35.595
Look, I got to go.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.848
The kid at Table 3's
throwing poi again.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.058
Maybe some other time, okay?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.144
Don't worry.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.521
She likes your butt and fancy hair.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.940
I know. I read her diary.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.859
She thinks it's fancy?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.209
Look what I find! Get restraints!

34:06.294 --> 34:08.962
- Right.
- Take that! Hurry!

34:09.547 --> 34:11.339
Hold still just a...

34:27.356 --> 34:28.648
Hey, Nani!

34:30.068 --> 34:32.069
Is that your dog?

34:32.862 --> 34:34.071
All is well.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.447
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

34:36.532 --> 34:39.076
Your head looks swollen.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.244
Actually, she's just ugly.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.664
Darling. He's joking.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.875
Ugly, look at me.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.002
This is not working out.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.378
But...

34:51.797 --> 34:52.922
Yeah?

34:52.965 --> 34:57.677
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid fakey luau anyway?

34:58.179 --> 34:59.638
Come on, Lilo.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.938
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?

35:08.022 --> 35:10.607
Nah. The manager's a vampire,

35:10.691 --> 35:14.236
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.779
I knew it.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.200
This is a great home. You'll like it a lot.

35:21.953 --> 35:22.994
See?

35:23.079 --> 35:24.454
Lilo...

35:24.539 --> 35:25.789
Comfy.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.250
- Hey!
- Hey!

35:28.292 --> 35:29.626
What is the matter with you?

35:29.669 --> 35:32.462
Be careful of the little angel!

35:32.505 --> 35:35.215
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.550
We just have to take him back.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.219
He's just cranky
because it's his bedtime.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.595
He's creepy, Lilo.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.557
I won't sleep
knowing he's loose in the house.

35:43.641 --> 35:47.310
You're loose in the house all the time,
and I sleep just fine!

35:47.395 --> 35:49.146
Hey, what are you doing?

35:49.188 --> 35:50.814
Stop that, Stitch!

35:50.898 --> 35:52.107
Hey!

35:54.527 --> 35:55.610
Look at him, Lilo.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.029
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.948
We have to take him back.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.617
He was an orphan,
and we adopted him!

36:02.660 --> 36:04.327
What about 'ohana?

36:04.412 --> 36:06.204
He hasn't been here that long.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.958
Neither have I.
Dad said 'ohana means "family."

36:13.921 --> 36:16.298
'Ohana means "family."

36:16.340 --> 36:19.426
- "Family" means...
- Nobody gets left behind.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.928
- Or?
- Or forgotten.

36:22.013 --> 36:26.349
I know. I know. I hate it
when you use 'ohana against me.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.773
Don't worry,
you can sleep right next to me.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.907
Look how curious the puppy is.

36:41.991 --> 36:45.202
This is my room, and this is your bed.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.788
This is your dolly and bottle.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.999
See? Doesn't spill.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.293
I filled it with coffee.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.879
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.674
Hey! That's mine!

37:02.720 --> 37:03.887
Down!

37:06.849 --> 37:11.394
Be careful of that! You don't touch this!
Don't ever touch it!

37:17.109 --> 37:21.613
No! Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.660
No! That's from my blue period.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.459
There.

37:34.543 --> 37:37.254
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

37:37.296 --> 37:40.257
Why not try and make something
for a change?

37:57.024 --> 37:58.775
Wow. San Francisco.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.162
Save me!

38:15.793 --> 38:17.711
No more caffeine for you.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.008
This little girl is wasting her time.

38:23.092 --> 38:26.886
626 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.350
Push that over.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.313
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

38:36.355 --> 38:39.274
- Say, I want to try it on.
- No!

38:39.317 --> 38:40.525
- Share!
- Hey!

38:40.609 --> 38:43.653
You're just jealous 'cause I'm pretty!

38:44.030 --> 38:45.113
Don't move.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.866
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.243
She's so beautiful.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.954
Look, another one.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.916
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.168
And they like me!

38:58.210 --> 39:00.879
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.

39:00.963 --> 39:03.173
Now, they're, they're...

39:08.012 --> 39:10.889
I think it might be a koala, an evil koala.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.682
I can't even pet it.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.560
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

39:19.231 --> 39:20.398
Hello?

39:21.692 --> 39:22.859
Nani?

39:24.820 --> 39:26.029
Hello?

39:27.031 --> 39:28.531
Are you there?

39:32.620 --> 39:35.372
- Now, this is interesting.
- What?

39:35.456 --> 39:38.249
626 was designed to be a monster,

39:38.334 --> 39:41.127
but now he has nothing to destroy.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.383
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.428
What must it be like to have nothing,

39:50.513 --> 39:54.849
not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?

40:04.819 --> 40:05.902
Nah!

40:27.842 --> 40:29.968
That's the Ugly Duckling.

40:30.052 --> 40:32.679
See? He's sad because he's all alone

40:32.763 --> 40:34.389
and nobody wants him.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.434
But on this page,
his family hears him crying

40:37.476 --> 40:39.018
and they find him.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.187
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy,

40:41.272 --> 40:43.690
because he knows where he belongs.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.285
Want to listen to the King?

40:56.328 --> 40:58.705
You look like an Elvis fan.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.210
Nani.

41:04.670 --> 41:05.795
Nani!

41:06.839 --> 41:08.089
Yeah?

41:08.132 --> 41:09.299
Look.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.824
Heard you lost your job.

41:34.909 --> 41:39.412
Well, actually, I just quit that job,

41:39.497 --> 41:41.956
because, you know,
the hours are just not conducive

41:41.999 --> 41:43.791
to the challenges of raising a child...

41:43.834 --> 41:45.001
Hey!

41:45.044 --> 41:46.878
I am so sorry about that.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.755
What is that thing?

41:48.839 --> 41:50.465
That's my puppy.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.674
Really?

41:55.513 --> 42:00.266
Thus far, you have been adrift
in the sheltered harbor of my patience,

42:00.351 --> 42:03.228
but I cannot ignore you being jobless.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.939
Do I make myself clear?

42:06.023 --> 42:07.565
Perfectly.

42:07.650 --> 42:12.403
And next time I see this dog, I expect it
to be a model citizen, capisce?

42:13.864 --> 42:15.198
Yes?

42:15.241 --> 42:16.533
New job.

42:17.117 --> 42:18.660
Model citizen.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.663
Good day.

42:27.127 --> 42:28.545
Mrs. Hasagawa?

42:28.587 --> 42:30.630
I'm here to answer your newspaper ad.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.049
Elvis Presley was a model citizen.

42:33.133 --> 42:36.386
I've compiled a list of his traits
for you to practice.

42:36.428 --> 42:39.055
Number one is dancing.

42:39.139 --> 42:40.682
I can't talk now, dear.

42:40.724 --> 42:43.017
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.561
That's why I'm here.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.062
Hands on your hips.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.855
Now follow my lead.

42:54.530 --> 42:55.822
That's my want ad.

42:55.906 --> 42:57.156
I know!

43:05.541 --> 43:07.667
Why is everything so dark?

43:07.751 --> 43:09.919
I am all about coffee.

43:10.212 --> 43:12.297
Let's move on to step two.

43:12.381 --> 43:15.383
Elvis played guitar. Here.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.678
Hold it like this,
and put your fingers here.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.931
See? Now you try.

43:23.934 --> 43:26.561
And I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

43:26.604 --> 43:29.022
I wish I could, Nani,
but I just hired Teddy,

43:29.106 --> 43:31.357
and with tourist season ending...

43:43.787 --> 43:46.289
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

43:46.373 --> 43:48.041
I just love to answer phones...

43:48.125 --> 43:50.918
This is the face of romance.

43:50.961 --> 43:54.255
She looks like
she could use some loving.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.886
We might have something.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.638
Good. Now kiss her.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.852
I'm sure Elvis had his bad days, too.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.896
I'm all about saving people.

44:09.980 --> 44:12.357
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.734
- Really?
- Okay, this is it.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.653
Time to bring it all together.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.071
That'd be so great!

44:18.155 --> 44:20.990
You have no idea
how badly I need this job.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.663
It's all you! Knock them dead!

44:49.186 --> 44:50.728
Don't crowd him!

44:56.694 --> 44:58.277
Hey, knock it off!

45:36.734 --> 45:38.192
Hey, Lilo!

45:38.861 --> 45:40.570
How's it, Nani?

45:41.238 --> 45:43.448
We've been having a bad day.

45:49.830 --> 45:52.206
Hey, I might not be a doctor,

45:52.249 --> 45:55.626
but I know that there's no better cure
for a sour face

45:55.711 --> 45:59.213
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.798
What you think?

46:01.925 --> 46:04.093
I think that's a great idea.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.907
Yeah!

48:04.882 --> 48:06.465
Can't complain, Mom.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.301
I'm camping out
with a convicted criminal,

48:08.385 --> 48:11.220
and I had my head chewed on
by a monster!

48:11.263 --> 48:14.223
Wait, something is not right.

48:14.266 --> 48:17.476
626 is returning willingly to water.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.854
Hold on, Mom, another call.

48:20.731 --> 48:24.483
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.

48:24.568 --> 48:26.152
Things are going well.

48:26.236 --> 48:27.445
He cannot swim!

48:27.529 --> 48:29.447
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?

48:29.531 --> 48:31.449
Why will he risk drowning?

48:31.533 --> 48:34.493
Jumba? Jumba, help me out here.

48:34.578 --> 48:38.080
I would have expected you back
by now with 626 in hand.

48:38.123 --> 48:42.335
Just a few things left to pack,
and we'll be...

48:42.419 --> 48:45.171
Hang up. We are going swimming.

49:22.876 --> 49:25.211
Yeah!

49:35.347 --> 49:36.472
Lilo!

49:38.058 --> 49:39.100
What happened?

49:39.142 --> 49:43.062
Some lolo must have
stuffed us in the barrel.

49:43.146 --> 49:44.647
Where's Stitch?

49:46.692 --> 49:48.150
Get off of her!

49:49.152 --> 49:50.528
What happened?

49:50.612 --> 49:52.571
Stitch dragged her down.

50:00.872 --> 50:02.415
We lost Stitch!

50:28.567 --> 50:33.362
Lilo? Lilo, look at me.
Look at me, baby. Are you hurt?

50:33.447 --> 50:34.613
No.

50:38.660 --> 50:41.495
He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.136
David, take Lilo.

50:58.764 --> 51:03.184
This isn't what it looks like.
We were... It's just that...

51:07.314 --> 51:09.398
I know you're trying, Nani,

51:09.483 --> 51:13.277
but you need to think about
what's best for Lilo,

51:13.361 --> 51:16.489
even if it removes you from the picture.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.537
I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.248
I'm sorry.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.883
Nani? Is there something I can do?

51:36.593 --> 51:38.052
No, David.

51:40.263 --> 51:42.431
I need to take Lilo home now.

51:43.558 --> 51:46.519
We have a lot to talk about, you know.

51:46.603 --> 51:47.812
Thanks.

51:51.733 --> 51:55.528
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

51:57.614 --> 51:59.365
Then you came along.

52:26.726 --> 52:28.185
Lilo, honey,

52:30.814 --> 52:32.314
we have to...

52:34.276 --> 52:37.987
Don't worry. You're nice,
and someone will give you a job.

52:39.489 --> 52:40.823
I would.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.494
Come here.

53:11.188 --> 53:15.983
One fond embrace

53:21.489 --> 53:28.204
Until we meet again

53:49.309 --> 53:50.976
That's us before.

53:52.687 --> 53:55.439
It was rainy, and they went for a drive.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.318
What happened to yours?

54:00.362 --> 54:04.365
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?

54:08.161 --> 54:11.538
I know that's why you wreck things
and push me.

54:18.296 --> 54:22.633
Our family's little now,
and we don't have many toys,

54:22.717 --> 54:25.761
but if you want,
you could be a part of it.

54:26.763 --> 54:30.432
You could be our baby,
and we'd raise you to be good.

54:34.938 --> 54:36.981
'Ohana means "family."

54:38.316 --> 54:41.610
"Family" means
nobody gets left behind,

54:43.947 --> 54:46.573
but if you want to leave, you can.

54:52.580 --> 54:54.623
I'll remember you, though.

54:57.210 --> 54:59.586
I remember everyone that leaves.

55:29.617 --> 55:31.160
I...

55:31.703 --> 55:32.953
Lost.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.838
I'm lost.

55:49.637 --> 55:50.888
Help!

55:51.598 --> 55:53.766
I don't like the ocean!

55:55.852 --> 56:00.439
Look, a friendly little dolphin.
They helped sailors in the war...

56:00.523 --> 56:03.650
It's a shark!
It's a shark, and it ain't friendly!

56:03.693 --> 56:06.487
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!

56:06.529 --> 56:09.698
Octopus, come and help me?
The octopus is worse than the shark!

56:09.783 --> 56:11.575
I hate this planet!

56:20.377 --> 56:23.087
Little monster!

56:30.053 --> 56:31.553
Agent Pleakley here.

56:31.638 --> 56:33.889
I have lost patience with you both.

56:33.973 --> 56:37.684
Have you captured 626 or not?

56:39.896 --> 56:42.398
Consider yourselves fired
and prison-bound.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.734
Your incompetence is
nothing short of unspeakable!

56:46.778 --> 56:48.070
But...

56:50.240 --> 56:52.825
We're fired!

56:52.909 --> 56:55.661
Now we do it my way!

56:55.745 --> 56:56.954
Your way?

56:57.747 --> 56:58.789
Wait!

56:59.416 --> 57:02.376
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

57:03.086 --> 57:04.294
Jumba and Pleakley.

57:04.379 --> 57:06.964
Whatever. The mission is in jeopardy.

57:07.048 --> 57:12.052
This could be your chance
to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

57:12.095 --> 57:15.097
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?

57:15.974 --> 57:17.391
Immediately.

57:32.240 --> 57:36.618
Don't run. Don't make me shoot you.
You were expensive.

57:38.163 --> 57:41.331
Yes. Yes, that's it. Come quietly.

57:43.710 --> 57:44.877
Waiting.

57:44.961 --> 57:46.211
For what?

57:49.507 --> 57:50.799
Family.

57:53.261 --> 57:55.137
You don't have one.

57:55.638 --> 57:57.639
I made you.

57:58.391 --> 58:01.185
Maybe I could.

58:01.269 --> 58:03.228
You're built to destroy.

58:03.771 --> 58:06.148
You can never belong.

58:07.984 --> 58:11.236
Now come quietly,
and we will take you apart.

58:11.863 --> 58:14.490
No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!
Don't run!

58:29.464 --> 58:30.589
Lilo.

58:31.925 --> 58:33.967
I didn't hear you get up.

58:36.137 --> 58:37.471
Baby, what's wrong?

58:37.514 --> 58:39.348
Stitch left.

58:39.432 --> 58:40.974
Really?

58:41.017 --> 58:42.809
It's good he's gone.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.771
He didn't want to be here, anyway.

58:46.231 --> 58:47.940
We don't need him.

58:51.861 --> 58:53.111
Lilo,

58:54.364 --> 58:56.698
sometimes you try your hardest,

58:56.741 --> 59:00.369
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

59:01.287 --> 59:05.207
Sometimes things have to change,

59:05.291 --> 59:08.585
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better,

59:09.254 --> 59:10.587
even if...

59:12.257 --> 59:13.382
Nani!

59:15.260 --> 59:17.886
- David!
- I think I found you a job.

59:17.929 --> 59:19.054
You what?

59:19.097 --> 59:21.723
Old man Kuakini's store,
but we got to hurry.

59:21.808 --> 59:26.895
Okay. Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.

59:26.980 --> 59:28.814
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.274
I'm going to be right back.

59:30.358 --> 59:33.610
Lock the door
and don't answer it for anyone, okay?

59:34.571 --> 59:37.030
Things are finally turning around.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.242
David, I owe you one.

59:40.285 --> 59:41.410
That's okay.

59:41.494 --> 59:44.413
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.

59:49.919 --> 59:52.004
Come back here, you little...

59:55.592 --> 59:56.758
Stitch?

59:57.468 --> 59:58.760
What is it?

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:05.851
Hiding behind your little friend
won't work anymore.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.895
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.440
New rules.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.742
What are we going to do?

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.120
I love this song!

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:26.371
Pliers.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.457
- Screwdriver.
- Check.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:32.919
Come out, my friend,
from whomever you're hiding behind.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.548
What the...

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:42.679
Come on! What's the big deal?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.141
I'll put you back together again.

01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:49.144
I'll make you taller and not so fluffy!

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.229
I like fluffy!

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.149
No. No. No!

01:00:56.277 --> 01:00:58.612
Leave my mother out of this!

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.824
You could do with a makeover.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:07.829
I tried to give you my good looks,
but let's face it, something went wrong.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.247
No!

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.128
Quick! Follow me! If we make it to...

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:18.048
- You're alive!
- They're all over the place!

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:22.678
Running away? Here, let me stop you.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.682
You always get in the way!

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:28.558
Where's the girl?
What have you done to the girl?

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:32.604
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.065
No, no, no! No aliens!

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.070
Blue punch buggy!

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.407
No punch back.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.117
They want my dog!

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.119
There's no need to alert the authorities.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.745
Everything's under control.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:49.996
Lilo, who was that?

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.207
Good, my dog found the chainsaw.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.417
Lilo! Don't hang...

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.636
You shouldn't play with guns.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.721
Okay.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:06.888
Thank you.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.932
I just remembered. It's your birthday!

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:10.559
Happy birthday!

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:12.352
- Merry Christmas!
- It's not Christmas.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.437
Happy Hanukkah!

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.688
We're leaving Stitch?

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.898
Trust me. This is not going to end well.

01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:18.233
- One potato.
- Two potato.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:19.735
- Three potato.
- Four.

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:21.236
- Five potato.
- Six potato.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.404
Seven potato, more.

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:23.530
- My...
- Mother...

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.614
- Told...
- Me...

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:25.741
- You...
- Are...

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.242
- It.
- I win!

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.169
Thanks. Mahalo plenty.
You won't be disappointed.

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:40.130
I'll show up early to help
with the morning...

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.260
Don't turn left.

01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:49.097
No.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.564
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:58.940
Lilo!

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.695
Please don't do this.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.238
You know I have no choice.

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.282
No! You're not taking her!

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:08.867
I'm the only one who understands her!

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.869
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.954
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.957
But you don't know what you're doing!
She needs me!

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.293
Is this what she needs?

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:23.215
It seems clear to me that you need her
a lot more than she needs you.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.430
Lilo! Lilo!

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:45.111
Lilo!

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.456
You ruined everything.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.633
You're one of them?

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.887
Get out of here, Stitch.

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:15.183
Surprise!

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:20.438
And here I thought
you'd be difficult to catch.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:22.732
Silly me.

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:24.693
Lilo?

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.528
Lilo!

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:42.043
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:47.257
And, look,
I even caught you a little snack.

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.097
No! Stop!

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:06.651
Lilo.

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.615
Okay, talk.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:12.908
I know you had something
to do with this.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:14.951
Now where is Lilo?

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.329
Talk! I know you can.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.583
Okay, okay.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.671
Where's Lilo?

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:29.633
Lilo...

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:34.804
Now all your washing is up!

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.015
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.725
Listen carefully.

01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:45.774
Hello? Galactic Command?
Experiment 626 is in custody.

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.776
We'll wait right here.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.745
Don't interact with her.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.960
Where's Lilo?

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.670
Who? What?

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:11.800
Lilo, my sister.

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:19.557
Sorry, we do not know anyone by this...

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.810
Lilo! She's a little girl, this big!

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:26.189
She has black hair and brown eyes,
and she hangs around with that thing!

01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:30.443
We know her.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.821
Bring her back.

01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:34.864
We can't do that.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:37.325
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:41.621
See, problem is we're just here for him.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.790
So she's gone?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.375
Look at the bright side.

01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:48.169
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:57.679
Come.

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.150
'Ohana.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.610
Hey! Get away from her.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.196
No! What did you say?

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.866
'Ohana means "family."

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:23.747
- "Family" means nobody...
- Nobody gets left behind.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.832
Or forgotten.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.125
Yeah.

01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:30.336
Hey.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.838
What?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:36.468
After all you put me through, you
expect me to help you just like that?

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.054
Just like that?

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:41.598
Fine.

01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:44.225
Fine? You're doing what he says?

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:46.102
He's very persuasive.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:49.439
Persuasive?
What exactly are we doing?

01:07:49.523 --> 01:07:51.900
- Rescue.
- We're going to get Lilo?

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.740
Good! I was hoping to add theft,
endangerment

01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:01.743
and insanity to my list of things
I did today.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.078
You, too?

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.502
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.296
What? Did you think we walked here?

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.258
This is Gantu,
requesting hyperspace clearance.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.176
Stand by for clearance.

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:06.307
Clearance is granted on vector C-12.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.475
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.562
Gantu, what's going on?

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:15.483
I thought you'd like to know
that the little abomination is...

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.613
Yes, Captain?

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.368
I'll call you back.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.542
How did you get out of there?

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.796
So what exactly are we doing?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.216
Don't worry, is all part of plan.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.051
We are professionals.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.179
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.645
Hold on!

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:05.575
Okay, is show time!

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.341
This is it!

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.390
Go! Go! Go!

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.196
Little savage! Get off my ship!

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:49.244
Stitch!

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:06.135
Computer, locate Experiment 626.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.429
626 located.

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:10.556
We finish this now.

01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.061
Stitch is unconscious.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.731
- What do we do now?
- We stay close. Hope for a miracle.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.066
That's all we can do.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.662
No!

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.416
Don't leave me, okay?

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:47.969
Okay.

01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:59.564
Target 626 is in motion. Speed is 84.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.107
Impossible!

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:27.967
Stitch!

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.763
Abomination.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.181
Stupid head.

01:12:43.984 --> 01:12:47.362
You're vile! You're foul! You're flawed!

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.822
Also cute and fluffy!

01:13:03.295 --> 01:13:04.545
You came back.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.714
Nobody gets left behind.

01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:16.557
Lilo!

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:23.898
Good dog.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.126
David!

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:44.961
Hey, Lilo.

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:47.255
Can you give us a ride to shore?

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.008
Sure,

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.302
but I have to make two trips.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.224
So you're from outer space?
I heard the surfing's choice.

01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:01.018
We have 626.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.437
Take him to my ship.

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:04.647
- Leave him alone.
- Hold on.

01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:06.941
Grand Councilwoman, let me explain.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.192
Silence!

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.237
I am retiring you, Captain Gantu.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:15.032
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.701
Goes to me.

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.911
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a Fluff Trog farm

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.205
after we sort this thing out.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.708
I think I should...

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:26.169
You! You're the cause of all this!

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:29.130
If it wasn't for your Experiment 626,
none of this...

01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:31.507
- Stitch.
- What?

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.801
My name Stitch.

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.052
Stitch, then.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.305
If it wasn't for Stitch...

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:42.268
Does Stitch have to go in the ship?

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.770
Yes.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.814
Can Stitch say goodbye?

01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:49.650
Yes.

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:51.110
Thank you.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.201
Who are you?

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:02.622
This is my family.

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.583
I found it all on my own.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:11.088
It's little and broken, but still good.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.133
Yeah. Still good.

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:26.270
Does he really have to go?

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:30.608
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:34.403
I cannot change
what the council has decided.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.491
Lilo, didn't you buy that thing
at the shelter?

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:44.413
Hey!

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:48.668
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:52.380
I paid $2 for him. See this stamp?
I own him.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:56.217
If you take him, you're stealing.

01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:01.430
Aliens are all about rules.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.891
You look familiar.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:07.603
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.856
Yes. You had hair then.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.818
Take note of this.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:18.823
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile,

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:23.119
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.955
on Earth.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:32.920
And as caretaker
of the alien life form, Stitch,

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.673
this family is now
under the official protection

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:38.426
of the United Galactic Federation.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.971
We'll be checking in now and then.

01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:45.266
I was afraid you were going to say that.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.769
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:50.896
I know what you mean.

01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:57.320
Don't let those two get on my ship.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:08.998
CIA?

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:10.166
Former.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.126
Saved the planet once.

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.461
Convinced an alien race

01:17:13.503 --> 01:17:16.589
that mosquitoes were
an endangered species.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.299
Now, about your house...

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.304
Wait.
