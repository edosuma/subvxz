00:01.680 --> 00:03.781
Any architect
will tell you that no matter

00:03.868 --> 00:06.195
how impressive
a structure is,

00:07.077 --> 00:10.155
it's only as strong
as its weakest link.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.881
Since when do you
know so much about bridges?

00:20.949 --> 00:22.648
You know everything
relates back to science.

00:22.715 --> 00:24.936
Are you two
always this chatty? Pretty much.

00:25.004 --> 00:27.968
Then I guess I'll be known
as the quiet one.

00:33.570 --> 00:36.228
This whole thing will come down
if we can't relieve the pressure.

00:36.296 --> 00:39.953
How much time do we have?
They're breaking every 12.6 seconds.

00:40.031 --> 00:43.025
You do the math. So the answer is...
"not enough."

00:43.093 --> 00:45.408
The weight shouldn't matter
if we can create a web support

00:45.476 --> 00:46.882
with the proper
geometric angles...

00:46.979 --> 00:49.734
Compression at its top part
and tension in its lower.

00:50.007 --> 00:51.218
Got it!

00:51.492 --> 00:53.929
Then stop the chitchat
and get to work.

00:54.562 --> 00:56.189
This feels weird.

00:57.734 --> 00:58.932
Costume riding up again?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.539
No, working
with the Octopus.

01:01.742 --> 01:03.968
That's Otto Octavius,
for crying out loud.

01:04.101 --> 01:07.703
He almost failed me
for using a No. 3 pencil!

01:07.920 --> 01:10.307
What if he starts
critiquing my spider moves?

01:10.375 --> 01:12.316
Relax. He doesn't know
we're his students.

01:12.403 --> 01:15.953
We're just two heroes welcoming
him to the superhero community.

01:18.653 --> 01:20.653
Just one more pass, and...

01:21.443 --> 01:23.099
Had to get creative, huh?

01:23.193 --> 01:27.513
It's what I do... along with
keeping this city safe.

<i>Luckily for New York commuters,</i>

01:41.603 --> 01:44.575
<i>the Spider-Men, and the newest
member of their group, the Octopus,</i>

01:44.643 --> 01:46.928

01:46.996 --> 01:48.194
Turn that off.

01:48.262 --> 01:50.098
Yes, sir.
Should I drive us home?

01:50.166 --> 01:54.270
No. Keep circling
until I say otherwise.

01:54.749 --> 01:56.465
Whoa!

02:03.332 --> 02:06.385
Don't you know claws
ruin a car's finish?

02:06.661 --> 02:10.332
Will you look at that! I think
someone's pet lizard escaped.

02:10.457 --> 02:13.082
Better than battling
a giant hamster, I guess.

02:18.951 --> 02:21.382
What? No witty remark? Yep.

02:21.450 --> 02:24.247
He's definitely going to be known
as the quiet one of the group.

02:26.158 --> 02:27.630
Oh, no, you don't!

02:27.698 --> 02:31.747
Arachna-pus formation! We
need a better name for that.

Gotcha! You're not
going any...

02:43.193 --> 02:44.896
Eww!

02:49.146 --> 02:52.898
Don't worry.
I'll stop... him.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.986
Okay, so here's a fun fact
I forgot.

02:56.054 --> 02:58.654
Lizards have the ability
to detach their tails

02:58.724 --> 03:00.583
and compress their bodies
nearly flat.

03:00.668 --> 03:05.294
Lucky us. We get a... souvenir.
It is lucky, actually.

03:05.365 --> 03:09.068
The DNA from this tail will
answer many of our questions.

03:09.279 --> 03:11.888
To the cave of analysis!

03:12.388 --> 03:16.161
No good? I was referring
to my lab at Horizon High.

03:16.622 --> 03:18.521
Thought you guys
wanted me to be witty.

03:20.979 --> 03:25.430
It's definitely a member
of the Lepidosauria family,

03:25.568 --> 03:27.766
but unlike the ones
we covered in class,

03:27.853 --> 03:30.325
these seem to have traces
of something else.

03:35.630 --> 03:38.990
I... I mean, look at
all these squiggly things!

03:39.435 --> 03:42.161
Those "squiggly
things," as you call them,

03:42.255 --> 03:44.052
are strands of human DNA.

03:44.186 --> 03:46.990
If you were one of my students,
I'd expect you to know that.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.279
But... That explains the
Lizard's size and posture,

03:49.347 --> 03:51.911
but not why it was
attacking that car.

03:52.083 --> 03:56.865
Maybe the question is not why it was
attacking, but who was it attacking.

04:02.036 --> 04:03.835
You put a camera
in your arm?

04:03.922 --> 04:05.435
Of course. For research.

04:05.607 --> 04:08.773
In fact, I've been
watching your spider moves,

04:08.860 --> 04:12.169
and I have a few suggestions
on how to improve them.

04:12.709 --> 04:14.732
I told you
he was critiquing us.

04:21.885 --> 04:24.880
That's Norman Osborn's car.

04:25.113 --> 04:27.168
Why would a lizard
be attacking Norman?

04:27.247 --> 04:31.404
My expertise is in atomic physics,
not reptilian behavior.

04:31.529 --> 04:33.990
Perhaps we could
use some help in this area.

04:34.089 --> 04:36.624
I'm running a search
for the best scientific minds

04:36.692 --> 04:39.474
in the fields of genetics
and herpetology.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.396
Ah! Of course!
Dr. Curt Connors.

04:42.575 --> 04:46.966
Geneticist, biologist,
biochemist, herpetologist.

04:47.185 --> 04:50.048
And he just happens
to work for Oscorp.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.369
That's too much of a
coincidence not to check out.

04:52.456 --> 04:57.322
Uh, may I remind you that Norman
Osborn isn't exactly a fan of ours?

04:57.409 --> 05:01.427
Really? He's been nothing
but supportive of my genius.

05:01.685 --> 05:05.411
Perhaps your association with me
will improve your standing.

05:05.617 --> 05:07.918
Maybe he'll be
the cocky one of the group.

05:13.041 --> 05:16.190
Otto Octavius and...

05:16.536 --> 05:19.229
colleagues
to see Curt Connors.

05:19.308 --> 05:20.544
I'm sorry, sir.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.388
No one is allowed past this desk
without an appointment.

05:23.575 --> 05:26.419
Then just call me "Nobody."

05:26.825 --> 05:29.974
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm still not seeing that name.

05:30.693 --> 05:32.318
I'm trying
to be quippy.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.125
Is it my delivery?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.427
Ah, they just need
to get to know you.

05:37.950 --> 05:42.185
In that case, behold, the Octopus!

05:43.260 --> 05:45.302
Oh, boy.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.607
Now may have not been the best
time to unleash those babies.

05:57.927 --> 05:59.102
Ow!

05:59.661 --> 06:01.372
Whoa!

06:03.693 --> 06:05.169
Yow!

06:08.904 --> 06:11.115
Right according to plan.

06:11.364 --> 06:13.365
Deactivate security!

06:14.845 --> 06:17.622
I think we already
deactivated it.

06:19.966 --> 06:22.693
Oh, then please
accept my apologies.

06:22.911 --> 06:24.635
That was not meant for you.

06:24.730 --> 06:27.630
There have been some...
attempts on my life recently,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.607
and I needed
to heighten security.

06:29.799 --> 06:32.419
Otto, a pleasure
to see you again.

06:32.544 --> 06:35.357
I'm glad your talents
have evolved as I predicted.

06:35.458 --> 06:38.771
And congrats to the three of you for
saving the bridge this morning.

06:38.888 --> 06:41.993
Hold on a second.
You're happy to see us?

06:42.255 --> 06:45.388
You're not going to try and
capture or experiment on us?

06:45.476 --> 06:50.474
Yeah. 'Cause I'm scanning your words
for sarcasm, and nothing's coming up.

06:50.685 --> 06:54.536
I told you that my association
would improve your likeability.

06:54.661 --> 06:58.543
Spider-Man, I owe the both
of you an explanation.

06:58.732 --> 07:00.864
I rushed to judgment
when I met you two,

07:00.951 --> 07:04.549
and, well, maybe it's been
the attempt on my life,

07:05.021 --> 07:08.943
but I realize I'm better off with
you as friends than as enemies.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.488
We'll see.

07:10.786 --> 07:12.490
The reason we're here,
Norman,

07:12.577 --> 07:14.904
is because we wanted
to talk to Curt Connors

07:14.982 --> 07:18.169
about that lizard that
attacked your car earlier.

07:18.383 --> 07:20.417
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

07:21.193 --> 07:23.115
You can't stand
in our way, Norman.

07:23.271 --> 07:27.357
I mean, you can't talk to
Curt Connors about the Lizard

07:27.638 --> 07:30.060
because Curt Connors
<i>is</i> the Lizard.

07:30.396 --> 07:32.210
What? What happened?

07:32.396 --> 07:37.382
Curt was... <i>is</i> one of Oscorp's
most brilliant scientists.

07:37.716 --> 07:40.341
But when he heard I was funding
research in limb regeneration

07:40.435 --> 07:44.300
based on lizard DNA, he thought he
could apply it to his lost arm.

07:44.442 --> 07:46.919
I told him that
the research wasn't ready,

07:47.232 --> 07:50.647
<i>but he went behind my back and
used the serum on himself anyway.</i>

07:50.818 --> 07:53.474
<i>It turned him into that lizard creature.</i>

07:53.818 --> 07:56.851
Now he blames me and has been
trying to destroy me for it.

07:56.919 --> 07:59.560
What a pathetic waste
of a mind.

07:59.825 --> 08:01.169
Huh?

08:01.991 --> 08:05.074
Dr. Connors, we were just talking
about you. I'm outta here!

08:05.286 --> 08:07.420
- Were your ears hurting?
- Activate security!

08:07.591 --> 08:10.083
Something tells me that's us!

08:15.311 --> 08:19.046
Wow! His tail came back
one, two, three!

08:22.047 --> 08:24.771
And I'm coming back
with a one-two punch!

08:24.838 --> 08:27.615
Don't hurt him!
That's still Curt Connors.

08:27.696 --> 08:30.152
Arachna-pus formation!
Still not loving that name.

08:30.229 --> 08:31.872
No time for gymnastics.

08:31.940 --> 08:34.376
We need to stop
him from hurting Norman!

08:34.443 --> 08:36.832
It's not gymnastics,
Otto.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.349
It's teamwork!

08:40.388 --> 08:43.496
Norman, what type of fire
suppression do you have here?

08:43.779 --> 08:46.966
- A cooling gas system.
- Perfect.

08:51.054 --> 08:53.703
Lizards are cold-blooded.

08:53.771 --> 08:56.279
No heat, no movement.

08:57.274 --> 09:00.529
Thanks for
the h-h-heads-up.

09:00.685 --> 09:04.216
We should get him webbed before he
heats up again. No need.

09:04.356 --> 09:06.489
My technicians have been
working on a containment suit

09:06.576 --> 09:08.568
in the hopes
we would capture him.

09:09.013 --> 09:11.974
It's probably best
if I keep him here.

09:12.564 --> 09:16.825
I have a team of scientists working
on a cure from the original formula.

09:17.468 --> 09:20.888
I'll admit, that
containment suit seems pretty secure.

09:21.138 --> 09:23.177
Otto, I need your help.

09:23.273 --> 09:26.271
I have some data that I believe
can be converted into a cure,

09:26.482 --> 09:30.286
but no one on my team is anywhere
near the genius that you are.

09:30.354 --> 09:33.036
- Would you take a look?
- I'd be happy to help.

09:33.165 --> 09:36.904
It's nice to have one's genius
recognized for a change.

09:37.091 --> 09:40.708
Ah. Good.
And I just have to ask again,

09:40.812 --> 09:44.974
is there any way I could get you to
leave Horizon and come work for me?

09:45.474 --> 09:48.193
Well, I appreciate
that, Norman.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.950
But the thing is,
while I know I'm brilliant,

09:52.018 --> 09:54.048
I am only 19 years old,

09:54.116 --> 09:56.157
and Max was the first to trust

09:56.225 --> 09:59.149
that age would have
no bearing on genius.

09:59.352 --> 10:03.179
So I feel I owe him...
for now.

10:03.321 --> 10:05.212
Very admirable.

10:05.450 --> 10:09.462
But if you change your mind,
my door is always open.

10:09.642 --> 10:10.837
Thank you, Norman.

10:10.905 --> 10:13.063
You don't know
how happy this makes me.

10:13.485 --> 10:15.274
You're welcome!

10:21.009 --> 10:23.345
You're doing well, Curt.

10:25.110 --> 10:26.422
Just one more job,

10:26.490 --> 10:29.423
and I promise we'll regrow
that arm of yours.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.923
Norman, please.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.634
Stop turning me
into that thing.

10:35.165 --> 10:37.806
Oh, you don't want me
to stop now.

10:37.969 --> 10:41.681
I'm so close to sharing the
regenerative formula with you.

10:41.845 --> 10:44.087
That is what you want,
isn't it?

10:44.307 --> 10:45.751
Okay.

10:46.899 --> 10:49.212
Just one more time.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.688
Excellent. Now rest up.

10:52.812 --> 10:54.593
You've got
a big day tomorrow.

10:54.829 --> 10:57.806
After I've made
one important phone call.

10:58.276 --> 11:00.946
- You okay, Pete?
- Yeah. Sorry.

11:01.102 --> 11:04.626
I just... I'm starting to
feel Otto pulling away.

11:04.841 --> 11:07.188
I thought I could train him
to be a superhero like us,

11:07.256 --> 11:10.790
but I'm concerned my teachings
might take a back seat to his ego.

11:10.858 --> 11:13.221
Look, you're a great
role model, Pete.

11:13.289 --> 11:14.818
And if Otto can't see that, of arms.

11:14.885 --> 11:18.040
Then maybe he needs
mechanical eyes instead of arms.

11:18.255 --> 11:20.575
Or maybe
I need to work harder.

11:20.770 --> 11:21.880
Well...

11:21.948 --> 11:24.249
good luck getting through
that grumpy exterior.

11:24.376 --> 11:27.731
'Cause I don't see the hero
as clearly as you do.

11:28.518 --> 11:32.817
Hello, you precious
little underachievers.

11:32.911 --> 11:36.419
As you know,
today is test day.

11:36.539 --> 11:41.023
And since your grades on the last
test were so abysmal,

11:41.133 --> 11:45.091
I've come to the conclusion
I'm working you too hard.

11:45.159 --> 11:47.716
So, since I'm in
such a good mood,

11:47.794 --> 11:49.739
I'm just going to give you
all A's!

11:49.807 --> 11:51.653
You get an A! You get an A!

11:51.728 --> 11:53.567
A's for everyone!

11:53.793 --> 11:56.661
Wow! I take it back.
He is my hero.

11:56.889 --> 11:58.708
Otto, may I have a word?

11:58.953 --> 12:02.864
Oh, ho, ho!
Of course, Maxy, ol' boy!

12:03.960 --> 12:06.576
Otto, how many times
do I have to remind you

12:06.702 --> 12:10.559
not to conduct unauthorized experiments
within the walls of Horizon High?

12:10.627 --> 12:13.925
- What are you talking about?
- I received a call informing me

12:14.010 --> 12:16.210
you're involved with
something dangerous again.

12:16.399 --> 12:18.930
- From whom?
- That doesn't matter.

12:19.017 --> 12:21.985
Clearly it does if you're going
to take their side over mine.

12:22.072 --> 12:25.989
Look, even you have to admit
you don't have the best track record.

12:26.216 --> 12:28.006
First it was
the mechanical arms,

12:28.093 --> 12:30.760
and then the secret power source
you were working on.

12:30.847 --> 12:32.958
Both successes,
I might add.

12:33.091 --> 12:35.452
Yes. But those experiments
put you,

12:35.520 --> 12:37.622
your students,
and this school in danger,

12:37.731 --> 12:39.755
and I simply cannot have that.

12:39.895 --> 12:42.257
My rules are in place
for a reason.

12:42.430 --> 12:45.169
Max, I am not involved
with anything

12:45.243 --> 12:47.794
that would put anybody
here at Horizon in danger.

12:47.862 --> 12:50.444
All right.
If that's what you say,

12:50.627 --> 12:52.356
then I trust you.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.637
What?

12:56.872 --> 12:59.887
<i>Otto? Otto?
It's Norman!</i>

13:00.058 --> 13:03.216
<i>The Lizard's broken free of his restraints!
Have you found the cure?</i>

13:03.284 --> 13:06.825
Yes, I believe I have.
<i>Then get over here fast.</i>

13:06.934 --> 13:08.755
My life... is in danger!

13:08.857 --> 13:11.012
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

13:16.741 --> 13:18.458
Class dismissed.

13:19.052 --> 13:21.216
- But the bell hasn't rung.
- Huh?

13:21.716 --> 13:22.773
Now, remember,

13:22.841 --> 13:25.223
this has to look good
for Otto.

13:25.497 --> 13:29.544
Do this, and you'll never
have to become the Lizard again.

13:29.775 --> 13:34.294
And you will finally give me
the formula to regrow my arm.

13:34.483 --> 13:36.747
Am I not a man of my word?

13:37.870 --> 13:40.214
Hope I'm in time!

13:47.640 --> 13:49.648
Get behind me, Norman!

13:52.777 --> 13:54.562
Is this a private party?

13:54.677 --> 13:57.789
What are you two doing here?
I got the call, not you.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.609
We're a team, Otto.

13:59.730 --> 14:03.114
I don't need you.
I have the cure.

14:03.344 --> 14:05.788
- Where'd you get that?
- Norman knew it would take

14:05.875 --> 14:08.706
a superior level of genius
to create one,

14:08.793 --> 14:10.797
so he gave the data to me.

14:10.890 --> 14:13.805
Hey! Did you test the genetic
markers for abnormalities?

14:13.888 --> 14:16.664
Or calculate the
polymerase chain reaction?

14:16.732 --> 14:19.848
You should probably test it
before you just inject him.

14:20.094 --> 14:22.555
Don't try and pass yourselves
off as scientists

14:22.623 --> 14:25.253
by regurgitating things
you've heard me say.

14:25.321 --> 14:29.367
You referred to DNA as squiggly
things, for crying out loud.

14:32.703 --> 14:36.797
Now we'll see
what true genius can do!

14:42.344 --> 14:46.203
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say that wasn't a cure.

14:49.508 --> 14:51.211
My calculations were correct.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.096
Th-This shouldn't be happening.

14:53.269 --> 14:55.390
Could someone have tampered
with your vial, Otto?

14:55.458 --> 14:57.656
Someone who wants to stop you
from being a hero

14:57.862 --> 15:00.242
so they can have
all the glory?

15:00.754 --> 15:03.062
You! You did this!

15:03.185 --> 15:06.273
Switched it with something
while we were grappling for it.

15:06.404 --> 15:09.984
Me? Otto, you've lost your mind if you
think I'd do something like that.

15:10.052 --> 15:13.172
Yeah. You think we want
a 60-foot lizard monster?

15:13.240 --> 15:15.883
'Cause if so, your ego is
as big as he is.

15:23.865 --> 15:25.208
Let go of me!

15:25.276 --> 15:27.333
- We need to work to...
- There's no time, Otto!

15:27.435 --> 15:30.311
Be the hero you are
and destroy this monster

15:30.443 --> 15:32.083
before it levels the city!

15:32.176 --> 15:36.255
No, Otto. We can still save
Dr. Connors. Together.

15:37.693 --> 15:40.240
I don't need
my hand held.

15:54.698 --> 15:56.315
Otto, stop it!

15:56.495 --> 15:58.815
You're enraging him!

15:59.073 --> 16:01.425
- And you're enraging me!
- Aah!

16:01.511 --> 16:04.931
Hey, ugly!
Here's web in your eye!

16:09.460 --> 16:11.633
Okay. Bad idea.

16:20.557 --> 16:24.429
So sorry the formula
didn't work as expected, Otto.

16:24.554 --> 16:28.603
Maybe my calculations
were... off.

16:28.968 --> 16:32.062
Looks like today
just isn't your day.

16:32.562 --> 16:35.593
See to it that this gets
to all the news outlets.

16:37.773 --> 16:39.726
He's alive.
Just unconscious.

16:39.866 --> 16:43.437
Good, 'cause he was getting a lot tougher
to fight than Lizilla over there.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.804
But I have an idea.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.373
Come on!

16:47.921 --> 16:49.423
Web him to these skyscrapers.

16:49.510 --> 16:52.906
They're made of reinforced steel
and should help slow him down.

17:07.616 --> 17:08.983
Oh, come on!

17:09.108 --> 17:10.624
This just keeps
getting grosser.

17:10.726 --> 17:13.025
But maybe it can be helpful.
One of us should take

17:13.093 --> 17:16.301
a sample of this back to Horizon
and see if we can't create a cure!

17:16.388 --> 17:18.352
- Whoa!
- Very smooth.

17:18.439 --> 17:20.569
Use Otto's computer.
Maybe it'll help you

17:20.671 --> 17:23.288
figure out what went wrong
the first time.

17:25.218 --> 17:28.452
You're about a what,
size 2,000 wide?

17:36.484 --> 17:39.359
Ugh! Knew
I should've gone with 3,000.

17:40.595 --> 17:42.718
Cures 'R Us.
How can I help you?

17:42.820 --> 17:44.593
Funny. How's it coming?

17:44.710 --> 17:47.616
Turns out the data
Norman gave Otto was tainted.

17:47.765 --> 17:49.951
Maybe even incorrectly labeled.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.190
<i>Norman's too smart to make a mistake
like that.</i>

17:52.258 --> 17:53.512
<i>Why would he do that to Otto?</i>

17:53.580 --> 17:55.461
I don't know, but now's not
the time to figure it out.

17:55.528 --> 17:58.127
Try decoupling the reptilian
DNA from the isotope.

18:00.361 --> 18:01.590
It's working!

18:01.658 --> 18:02.947
I'll have it to you
in no time.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.900
<i>Don't bother.
We're coming to you.</i>

18:05.126 --> 18:06.556
You're bringing him here?

18:06.705 --> 18:08.181
<i>He's a hundred-foot lizard!</i>

18:08.249 --> 18:10.540
<i>He's going wherever he wants!</i>

18:14.963 --> 18:17.297
Okay, you want the good news
or the bad news?

18:17.423 --> 18:19.158
There's more bad news?

18:19.580 --> 18:21.595
Let's just say
the Lizard is so big

18:21.663 --> 18:23.322
that his skin
is four times as thick.

18:23.390 --> 18:26.642
You need to inject him at the base of the
skull where the flesh is the thinnest.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.275
- What's the good news?
- You get to be the hero now.

18:29.362 --> 18:30.577
Good luck!

18:38.890 --> 18:40.163
Whoa!

18:40.742 --> 18:43.367
Hold still already,
will ya?

18:47.786 --> 18:49.324
Great.

18:53.985 --> 18:56.891
Now, time to test-drive
the new Web Wings.

19:01.489 --> 19:04.646
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Don't fall on Horizon!

19:05.943 --> 19:07.279
Phew!

19:09.650 --> 19:11.451
Oh, no.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.977
Dr. Connors, welcome back.

19:23.407 --> 19:25.962
<i>And it appears
that Otto Octavius,</i>

19:26.118 --> 19:28.009
<i>the self-proclaimed "Octopus,"</i>

19:28.110 --> 19:30.938
<i>is responsible
for the giant rampaging lizard</i>

19:31.079 --> 19:33.034
<i>that endangered the city.</i>

19:33.102 --> 19:36.251
- You lied to me, Otto.
- It wasn't supposed to be danger...

19:36.319 --> 19:37.698
I don't wanna hear it.

19:37.912 --> 19:40.517
I guess I can't
trust you anymore.

19:40.743 --> 19:42.605
So, it pains me
to say it, but...

19:42.673 --> 19:45.324
Let me save you
the trouble, Modell.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.650
I quit!

19:46.751 --> 19:49.759
I'm going someplace
where I'm appreciated!

19:50.118 --> 19:52.511
We should tell Max
that it wasn't Otto's fault...

19:52.579 --> 19:54.314
That Norman gave him
tainted data.

19:54.431 --> 19:58.165
I don't think Max is the one who needs
convincing that Otto should stay.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.781
- Otto!
- Hmm.

20:00.970 --> 20:03.425
Welcome to Osborn Academy.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.420
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

20:06.610 --> 20:09.415
Uh, go check
out your new lab.

20:09.650 --> 20:11.618
I'll be with you
in a moment.

20:11.813 --> 20:13.713
Thank you, Norman.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.884
Everything all right,
Spider-Man?

20:17.962 --> 20:19.743
Was this your plan
all along, Norman?

20:19.899 --> 20:22.665
Get Otto fired so you could
hire him here at Oz Academy?

20:22.766 --> 20:24.891
Why, whatever do you mean?

20:25.024 --> 20:28.837
Don't con me. If we're friends now,
then you'll tell me the truth.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.511
The truth, Spider-Man,

20:30.598 --> 20:33.696
is that we are decidedly
not friends.

20:33.907 --> 20:38.251
At least not until you confess that you are
a soldier in the Jackal's spider army.

20:38.415 --> 20:41.571
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then prepare yourself.

20:41.961 --> 20:44.386
Because if you thought
I was after you before,

20:44.454 --> 20:46.727
you have no idea
what's about to come next.

20:46.884 --> 20:49.454
Your days are numbered,
Spider-Man.

20:51.719 --> 20:54.305
Then he says my days are numbered.

20:54.384 --> 20:55.907
Man, that's twisted.

20:56.016 --> 20:58.475
But not the craziest thing
we've seen today.

20:58.752 --> 21:01.428
Hey, you sure nobody else
can do this?

21:01.496 --> 21:03.492
We're the ones
who detached it,

21:03.686 --> 21:05.967
so we're the ones
who have to get rid of it.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.481
I don't know, Miles.

21:08.669 --> 21:12.638
I really thought I could teach Otto not
to let his ego get the better of him.

21:12.866 --> 21:15.483
I thought I could turn him
into a hero like us.

21:15.687 --> 21:19.937
But if he's aligned himself with Norman
Osborn, I don't know what to think.

21:20.317 --> 21:22.186
Well, you know what they say.

21:22.357 --> 21:25.905
"No matter how much
a snake sheds its skin...

21:29.581 --> 21:31.758
it's still a snake."
