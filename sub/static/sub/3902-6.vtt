One thing--

05:48.449 --> 05:50.048
We're not here
to talk cases, mcnulty.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.084

Sit.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.021
Relax.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.956
I'm a reasonable guy.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.759
In fact, everywhere i go,
people say to me,

06:00.761 --> 06:04.096
Bill rawls, you are
a reasonable fucking guy.

06:04.098 --> 06:07.666
-<i> Am i right, jay?</i>
- You are reasonable, sir.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.401
<i> Yes, yes, i am.</i>

06:09.403 --> 06:12.104
And because your sergeant
knows me to be reasonable,

06:12.106 --> 06:13.739
He came in here
a couple weeks ago

06:13.741 --> 06:15.374
And reasoned with me,
right, jay?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.469
A question you don't
really have to--

06:44.471 --> 06:47.139
A rhetorical question.
You were being rhetorical.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.410
<i> We work murders cases</i>
<i> here, detective.</i>

06:51.412 --> 06:52.644
We work them
as they come in.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.613
One at a fucking time,
it's called a rotation.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.914
<i> You're up</i>
<i> 'til you catch one.</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:57.149
<i> When you catch one,</i>
<i> you step down,</i>

06:57.151 --> 06:59.050
You work it for a while,
someone else steps up.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.586
It's a simple, but effective
way to do business

07:01.588 --> 07:06.458
In a town that has 250
to 300 cases a year.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.092
Yes, sir.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.729
But if someone gets
it into his head to leave
the rotation,

07:10.731 --> 07:12.931
It puts an unfair burden
on the other detectives,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.900
Who have to pick up
their casework.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.602
<i> Overworked cops</i>
<i> make mistakes,</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:21.006
<i> Mistakes lower</i>
<i> the unit-wide</i>
<i> clearance rate.</i>

07:21.008 --> 07:23.442
And that can make
someone who is

07:23.444 --> 07:27.012
Otherwise
as reasonable as me...

07:28.949 --> 07:31.750

13:26.840 --> 13:28.439
Are you waiting
for crime lab?

13:28.441 --> 13:29.374
Over an hour.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.076
Only two units on the street
and both of 'em are up

13:32.078 --> 13:33.945
<i>At the city council</i>
<i> president's house.</i>

13:33.947 --> 13:34.913
What happened there?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.347
Someone stole
his lawn furniture.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.983
They're up there taking
pictures of an empty patio

13:38.985 --> 13:41.519
And dusting the backyard
gate for latents.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.420
I kid you not.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.556
I swear to god,
you show me the son
of a bitch

13:44.558 --> 13:46.191
That can fix this
police department,

13:46.193 --> 13:48.893
I'd give back
half my overtime.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.562
He was all
cut up and shit,

13:50.564 --> 13:54.165
<i> His insides</i>
<i> was hangin' out.</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:56.367
That's fucked up, yo.
I mean, damn.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.304
Sometimes, you gotta
send a message, yo.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.941
I mean, yo, when you
picked up that phone,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.442
What you think
they was gonna do, huh?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.979
Shit, all that shit
is in the game, man.
You know that.

14:07.981 --> 14:11.449
Yeah, like you
and that girl, huh?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.852
- What girl?
- The one in the apartment.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.287
- Come here, man.
-<i> The one you told us</i>
<i> about, remember?</i>

14:16.289 --> 14:20.158
I mean, i liked
what you said about all
that killing, you know.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.028
Especially that part
about how it ain't
got to be like that.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.330
Just sell the shit
and move on.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.233
Get me a ginger ale
and get something
for yourself.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.267
Boy:
<i> Yo, day, c'mon.</i>

14:29.269 --> 14:32.136
Yeah, i know,
i remember that, but it
ain't like that, is it?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.305
-<i> ( pager beeping )</i>
- yeah, i know.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.240
I know it ain't.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.643
<i> Thing about it was his eye,</i>
<i> his eye was blown out,</i>

14:38.645 --> 14:40.411
And the other one
was open...

14:40.413 --> 14:42.513
And, yo, dee,
it fucks me up!

14:42.515 --> 14:43.882
<i> It's like</i>
<i> he's looking out,</i>

14:43.884 --> 14:46.918
Like he sees
everything, you know?

14:47.487 --> 14:49.954
Don't think about it.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.489
I can't.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.124
Fuck!

14:53.126 --> 14:57.328
Yo, let that shit go.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.165
Just let it go.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.191
Yeah, barksdale kid
on the line.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.429
He's beeping someone.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.313
Who threw that?
You got a good arm.
Go deep.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.219
( phone ringing )

15:55.221 --> 15:56.621
- Yo.
-<i> What up?</i>

15:56.623 --> 15:59.958
- Yo, you ain't him.
-<i> Hold on, hold on.</i>

15:59.960 --> 16:03.695
<i> Hey, yo, strings,</i>
<i> it's dee.</i>

16:03.697 --> 16:05.596
Strings:
<i> Yeah.</i>

16:05.598 --> 16:07.065
Dee:
<i>Yeah, you hit me?</i>

16:07.067 --> 16:08.633
<i> Yeah, yeah, um...</i>
<i> I wanted to know,</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:12.003
<i> If you know young hopper,</i>
<i> the one they got down there?</i>

16:12.005 --> 16:12.637
<i>Which one?</i>

16:12.639 --> 16:15.306
<i> You know, the fool</i>
<i> who dropped the man</i>
<i> with a punch, you know?</i>

16:15.308 --> 16:16.741
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>what about him?</i>

16:16.743 --> 16:19.143
<i> He got some</i>
<i> promise, right?</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:20.278
<i>What you mean?</i>

16:20.280 --> 16:22.714
<i> Enough to bring</i>
<i> home, right?</i>

16:22.716 --> 16:25.450
You know, man,
whatever.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.188
<i> A'ight.</i>

16:30.523 --> 16:33.091
<i> ( phone clicking )</i>

16:33.093 --> 16:35.727
<i> ( beeping )</i>

16:49.275 --> 16:52.710
They bringin'
bodie home.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.682
The young boy
who was with him,

16:57.684 --> 16:59.417
Light-skinned kid
from the cemetery.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.753
- Greggs:<i> Where?</i>
- In the alley behind
the 800 block of argyle.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.689
-<i> Right across</i>
<i> from the low-rises.</i>
- Shot?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.425
- Stabbed, beaten, burned.
-<i> Jesus.</i>

17:07.427 --> 17:10.728
- Yeah, we gotta
get with omar.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

17:13.133 --> 17:15.266
( tires screeching )

17:20.607 --> 17:22.206
Impressive.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.476
It's not often that i see
respondents come so prepared

17:25.478 --> 17:27.345
<i> For a juvenile</i>
<i> commitment meeting.</i>

17:27.347 --> 17:29.380
<i>In addition to those</i>
<i> signed statements</i>

17:29.382 --> 17:31.682
From preston's sponsors
at the police athletic league,

17:31.684 --> 17:35.586
I also have a photostated
copy of a cashed check,

17:35.588 --> 17:38.656
Which indicates that he is
enrolled in the ged program

17:38.658 --> 17:42.527
At the baltimore city
community college.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.731
Can i ask how this young man
is able to afford, not one,

17:46.733 --> 17:49.233
But two attorneys
from your firm, mr. Levy?

17:49.235 --> 17:51.402
<i> This is pro bono,</i>
<i> your honor.</i>

17:51.404 --> 17:53.438
My firm is making it
a priority to identify

17:53.440 --> 17:55.473
A number of city youths
who are in crisis

17:55.475 --> 17:58.810
<i> And to undertake efforts</i>
<i> to reorder their lives.</i>

17:58.812 --> 18:00.845
Excuse me, but i can't
help but notice

18:00.847 --> 18:03.281
That your client is under
a delinquent petition

18:03.283 --> 18:05.383
<i> For the sale of narcotics,</i>
<i> and further,</i>

18:05.385 --> 18:06.784
For assault on
a police officer.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.287
Beyond that, he walked away
from a jsa facility.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.123
Your honor, my client
stands ready to acknowledge

18:12.125 --> 18:13.558
That he was involved,
for a time,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.359
<i>In the sale of</i>
<i>a small amount of drugs,</i>

18:15.361 --> 18:19.097
<i>A transaction for which</i>
<i>he received no remuneration,</i>

18:19.099 --> 18:20.264
<i> Having been manipulated</i>

18:20.266 --> 18:22.700
<i> By older traffickers</i>
<i> in his neighborhood.</i>

18:22.702 --> 18:25.103
<i> That was a mistake,</i>
<i> your honor.</i>

18:25.105 --> 18:25.636
So noted.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.705
However, we will contend
that it was preston

18:27.707 --> 18:29.674
Who was the victim
of a brutal police beating

18:29.676 --> 18:33.478
Indications of which
are still evident on him,
your honor.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.512
<i> He struck back,</i>

18:34.514 --> 18:36.781
<i> Wildly and in</i>
<i> self-defense,</i>
<i> your honor.</i>

18:36.783 --> 18:39.851
- And the walk-away?
- Preston was heavily medicated

18:39.853 --> 18:41.886
When he left
the cheltenham facility.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.187
In that state,
your honor,

18:43.189 --> 18:48.359
He was simply trying to get
back to see his grandmother.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.695
Did you know
what you were doing

18:50.697 --> 18:53.631
<i> When you left</i>
<i> boys village, son?</i>

18:53.633 --> 18:54.866
( clearing throat )

18:54.868 --> 18:57.201
Naw, i was, uh...
I was messed up.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.670
Anything else
you'd like to add?

18:59.672 --> 19:03.174
Um, just...

19:03.176 --> 19:05.810
I don't know, uh...

19:05.812 --> 19:08.346
I'm ready to be good.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.583
Pending a hearing on
these charges to be scheduled

19:12.585 --> 19:14.752
Within six months,
i'm putting the respondent

19:14.754 --> 19:16.888
On home monitoring
with his grandmother.

19:16.890 --> 19:17.788
Ah, your honor.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.892
I'm afraid mrs. Broadus
doesn't have a telephone

19:20.894 --> 19:22.727
<i> For any</i>
<i> monitoring calls.</i>

19:22.729 --> 19:24.428
She's on a fixed income,
your honor.

19:24.430 --> 19:28.833
How about he calls
his probation officer
twice a week?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.437
Cool, whatever.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.740
Your honor.

19:35.742 --> 19:39.677
-<i> ( dogs barking )</i>
-<i> ( sirens wailing )</i>

19:57.797 --> 20:00.531
( chattering )

20:01.568 --> 20:02.767
Yeah!

20:02.769 --> 20:04.602
Yo, bubbles,
what's the game?

20:04.604 --> 20:07.772
- Hey, johnny.
Up an' about, huh?
- Yeah.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.308
- Huck.
- Bubs.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.909
Where's the scam
at here?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.312
Ain't no scam.
Thank you, ma'am.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.248
What you got here
is an honest day's work

20:17.250 --> 20:19.283
For an honest day's pay.
Right, lavell?

20:19.285 --> 20:20.785
Oh, mr. Straight-time,
bubbles.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.487
Gotta give a little
somethin' back when
they least expect it.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.357
Me and huck here,
we got somethin' on too.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.626
- We got a plan.
- No.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.229
For real,
for real.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.002
Yo, we're gonna take off
on the copper house.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.606
Damn, johnny.
Your first few days out and
you goin' get all dramatical.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.574

- Got to be got, homes.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.544

- Fuck the fence.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.411
Fuck the--

20:47.413 --> 20:48.713

20:48.715 --> 20:51.816
Fuck the dog.
Yo, all that time i was
resting got me thinking.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.552
Yo, got good

20:54.554 --> 20:56.754
Copper house...

20:56.756 --> 20:58.956

20:59.692 --> 21:01.459
I gotta roll.
Okay, cash me out.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.929
Yo, if you ain't got dreams,
bubs, what the fuck you got?

21:04.931 --> 21:08.899

C'mon, dreamer.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.594
- Yeah?

<i> Got 'em.</i>

21:38.431 --> 21:39.897

21:39.899 --> 21:41.465
Hold a sec.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.800
Carv, call for you.

21:42.802 --> 21:43.968
Carver:
<i> Yeah, hello?</i>

21:43.970 --> 21:47.638
You ain't gonna believe
who i'm lookin' at right now.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.440
Again he walks off?

21:49.442 --> 21:53.044
Ding, round three.

21:58.351 --> 22:02.019

22:02.722 --> 22:04.588
- Yo.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.324
Yo, stink, what up.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.025
<i> Yo, where your</i>
<i> manners, fool?</i>

22:08.027 --> 22:08.959
<i>My bad, yeah.</i>

22:08.961 --> 22:11.629
<i> You need to keep</i>
<i> your fuckin' head, boy.</i>

22:11.631 --> 22:12.630
<i>Forgot it.</i>

22:12.632 --> 22:15.433
<i>Um, yo, what's up?</i>
<i>Where you at?</i>

22:15.435 --> 22:17.735
<i> I don't know,</i>
<i> where you at?</i>

22:17.737 --> 22:20.805
<i>Oh, i'm down in the pit.</i>
<i>Just came home.</i>

22:20.807 --> 22:23.474
I don't see nobody around,
i just wanted to know,

22:23.476 --> 22:24.742
You know, what was up.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.678
<i> Ain't nothin',</i>
<i> goin' late, man.</i>

22:27.680 --> 22:29.013
Oh.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.449
<i> Just catch us</i>

- non-pertinent?

22:42.495 --> 22:45.730
How do you log that
non-pertinent?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.898
No drug talk.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.702
They use codes to hide
their pager and phone numbers.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.038
And when someone
does use a phone,

22:54.040 --> 22:55.139
They don't use names.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.542
And if someone
does use a name,
he's reminded not to.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.846
All of that
is valuable evidence.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.481
Of what?

23:03.483 --> 23:05.649
Conspiracy.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.386
Conspiracy?

23:08.388 --> 23:10.921
We're building something
here, detective.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.990
We're building it
from scratch.

23:12.992 --> 23:18.462
All the pieces matter,
all right?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.708
( tires screeching )

23:30.710 --> 23:32.877
Shit.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.713
Ow, fuck.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.847
Oh, shit.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.517
Are you
fucking serious?

23:39.519 --> 23:40.117
Ah, fuck.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.886
You keep walking
away from jsa,

23:41.888 --> 23:43.454
<i> We keep</i>
<i> kicking your ass.</i>

23:43.456 --> 23:44.789
<i> I'm all right with that,</i>
<i> if you are.</i>

23:44.791 --> 23:47.158
Look, i ain't walk away
from nowhere, man.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.994
Check my back pocket.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.803
Home monitoring?

23:58.805 --> 24:01.672
Yeah, man,
if you ask questions

24:01.674 --> 24:02.973
Before y'all start
wilding on niggas,

24:02.975 --> 24:04.842
<i> You might save</i>
<i> everybody some trouble.</i>

24:04.844 --> 24:06.477
How the fuck
are you home?

24:06.479 --> 24:08.012
Yeah, you know
what i mean.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.148
Juvenile judge, man,
he saw my potential, okay?

24:11.150 --> 24:13.050
He expects
big things from me.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.518
Yeah, like what?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.053
<i> I don't know,</i>
<i> college, law school,</i>

24:16.055 --> 24:18.456
Medical school,
all that good shit.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.057
Seriously,
how are you out?

24:20.059 --> 24:21.826
Look, i'm gonna
tell you somethin'.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.828
Okay, this is just
my opinion, but, uh...

24:23.830 --> 24:26.564
The juvenile system
in this city is fucked up.

24:26.566 --> 24:30.601
<i> It's a big-ass fucking</i>
<i> joke, no offense.</i>

24:31.204 --> 24:34.104
Fucking fuck.

24:35.074 --> 24:35.973
Hey.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.477
Look, give me a ride
down to my grandma's,
we'll call it even.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.779
Man:
<i> Hey, yo, hold up!</i>

24:41.781 --> 24:43.581
In back, fucknuts.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.851
Man:
<i> Get a line real quick.</i>

24:50.723 --> 24:54.592
<i> ( sirens wailing )</i>

25:15.181 --> 25:16.914
Jay!

25:21.053 --> 25:24.288
<i> ( music playing )</i>

25:27.527 --> 25:28.559
( honks horn )

25:28.561 --> 25:32.830
Get your ass out of
the street, bitch.

25:35.234 --> 25:38.636
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.539
What's up?
What you need?

25:44.176 --> 25:47.678
Little late in
the month for this shit,
don't you think?

25:47.680 --> 25:50.014
What you mean?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.054
My aunt, she hit
the match-four.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.958
You stealing
from me, cass?

26:13.005 --> 26:14.939
<i> What?</i>

26:16.809 --> 26:18.842
Raymond,
you look fresh today.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.244
Got laid last night,
that's why.

26:20.246 --> 26:24.281
Oh, yeah?
Your asshole
still hurtin'?

26:24.283 --> 26:26.884
- Call jimmy.
- What's up, boss?

26:26.886 --> 26:31.088
Rawls finally got around
to reading the office reports

26:31.090 --> 26:32.189
That mcnulty
tried to give him.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.892
He wants arrest warrants
for deidre kresson

26:34.894 --> 26:38.896
And the two project murders
that match up to that gun.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.165
I know.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.701
Ah, c'mon, jay.
Be right on this.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.870
I can't, it's rawls.
He wants warrants today.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.038
All right, no problem.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.773
So, who the fuck are
we supposed to charge?

26:49.775 --> 26:52.743
You got a witness that puts
d'angelo barksdale

26:52.745 --> 26:55.179
At the scene of the murder,
the night of the murder.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.048
You've got a ballistics match
between the kresson girl

26:58.050 --> 27:02.219
And the two dead
mopes in the project
where barksdale hangs.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.153
Run with it.

27:03.155 --> 27:06.156
This weak-ass shit is not
gonna get past a grand jury.

27:06.158 --> 27:10.094
Charge the mope
and work it more afterward.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.732
Call jimmy,
let him know.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.670
Dee:
Yo.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.008
All right, listen up,
new deal.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.810
Wallace, you goin'
be on the stash now

27:26.812 --> 27:28.012
With latroy
and peaches.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.246
And what
about sterling?

27:29.248 --> 27:31.882
Sterling, he gonna
be down on preston
lookin' out for a while.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.751
- Cassandra too.
- What happened?

27:33.753 --> 27:36.353
- Nothing.
- Why you wanna
change up then?

27:36.355 --> 27:39.790
Nigga, i got to explain
shit to you now?

27:44.930 --> 27:46.997
Stringer bell's
pager number?

27:46.999 --> 27:49.967
Stinkum's too,
i'm pretty sure.

27:49.969 --> 27:50.934
Very sweet.

27:50.936 --> 27:53.837
If they moved around a bit
more, we'd have problems.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.840
But they're a little lazy,
you know.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.709
<i> Tend to go to</i>
<i> that one pay phone</i>

27:58.711 --> 28:01.412
<i> In the courtyard</i>
<i> a little too much.</i>

28:01.414 --> 28:03.914
Jesus.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.284
He's lit at 9:00
in the morning?

28:07.286 --> 28:11.388
Or from
the night before.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.831
Detective?

28:21.300 --> 28:24.835
<i> Detective polk.</i>

28:31.911 --> 28:35.913
Yeah, it's mcnulty,
bunk paged me.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.383
All right.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.794
Why did you even
come in today?

28:50.796 --> 28:52.096
I had some--

28:52.098 --> 28:54.131
To pretend that
you were here?

28:54.133 --> 28:55.799
To fill out
a run sheet?

28:55.801 --> 28:58.502
I know i missed a couple days
last week, lieutenant.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.939
I got run sheets
from you every day
for the last two weeks.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.941
Twice in
carver's handwriting.

29:03.943 --> 29:07.277
Twice it was prez.
Once it was mcnulty,
i think.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.080
They covered for you.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.815
<i> But i won't.</i>

29:11.817 --> 29:15.486
Well, lieutenant,
i, um...

29:17.823 --> 29:20.324
I don't know,
i'm not really up for this

29:20.326 --> 29:21.391
Drug thing, you know.

29:21.393 --> 29:25.496
Maybe if mahone was here,
i could get into it more.

29:25.498 --> 29:29.967
Learn some new tricks,
i'm...

29:31.103 --> 29:32.369
Oh, hell,
lieutenant,

29:32.371 --> 29:34.304
Why don't you just
send me back to property

29:34.306 --> 29:35.773
And keep
everybody happy?

29:35.775 --> 29:37.040
Send you back
to property crimes,

29:37.042 --> 29:38.942
So you can binge
for two more weeks?

29:38.944 --> 29:40.277
I'm not doing that.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.512
Lieutenant, please,
look i...

29:41.514 --> 29:43.380
You were dumped
on me, augie.

29:43.382 --> 29:47.184
But it ends there,
i don't dump people.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.119
You either go out
on those rooftops today

29:49.121 --> 29:50.988
To watch pay phones
with the rest of this unit,

29:50.990 --> 29:55.893
Or you go over
to the medical office
and check yourself in.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.395
- Medical?
- For alcohol abuse.

29:58.397 --> 30:04.234
Either dry yourself out,
or go up on those rooftops wet.

30:10.376 --> 30:14.444
Take a few minutes
and think on it.

30:23.022 --> 30:26.123
- Where'd they go?
- Who?

30:28.427 --> 30:30.160
Lieutenant...

30:30.162 --> 30:32.462
We need a file cabinet,
or two.

30:32.464 --> 30:35.332
The paperwork
from this, i mean...

30:35.334 --> 30:37.467
<i> There's a lot of it.</i>

30:37.469 --> 30:39.503
Lieutenant?

30:39.505 --> 30:42.472
Sir, um...

30:42.474 --> 30:46.443
I'm going to...

30:48.447 --> 30:51.515
Good luck
with the case.

30:51.517 --> 30:56.086
<i> ( reggae music playing )</i>

30:57.223 --> 31:00.891
Fucking rawls.
He's fucking up
the case to get to me.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.393
No, he's fucking it up
for three paper clearances

31:03.395 --> 31:05.128
On prior cases, jimmy.
It ain't personal.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.931
All he's got is d'angelo
at the scene through hearsay

31:07.933 --> 31:11.201
And a ballistics
match to a couple of
unrelated drug murders.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.369
How can
he charge that?

31:12.371 --> 31:13.937
Baby, he can charge
anything he wants

31:13.939 --> 31:15.138
To get credit
for the clearance.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.074
Grand jury doesn't indict,
he drops the case,
keeps the stats.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.376
I need to go in there
and tell him what
the fuck he can do.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.545
- No, you don't.
- No, i'm trying to build
something here,

31:21.547 --> 31:23.580
All rawls can think to do
is stick a finger in my eye.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.116
- You talk to landsman?
- Jay can't fix this.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.186
Rawls told him to have
the warrants typed
and ready by morning.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.121
You're telling me
he's gonna charge murders

31:31.123 --> 31:32.923
He can't prove
just to get the stats?

31:32.925 --> 31:34.658
And fuck up our case
in the process.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.260
We give up
the ballistics info

31:36.262 --> 31:37.661
And the motive for
the kresson killing

31:37.663 --> 31:40.130
In the charging documents
and avon barksdale,

31:40.132 --> 31:41.231
He's gonna change up.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.966
And what he don't change
up, he'll clean up.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.368
Somebody needs
to tell rawls that.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.369
Oh, rawls couldn't
care less.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.537
Rawls wants me home
and he wants the stats,
that's all.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.072
Then we take
this to daniels.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.641
- Daniels?
- It's his case,
he'll fight for it.

31:50.643 --> 31:53.477
- Daniels won't do shit.
- He plays stiff every
now and then,

31:53.479 --> 31:55.345
- But he's a good man.
- Are you kidding me?!

31:55.347 --> 31:58.382
Daniels has been
trying to put the brakes
on this for weeks now.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.284
This'll be his
new excuse to close shop.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.519
Well, look, you guys
got to make your move soon.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.554
All right?
I'm sorry to say.

32:04.556 --> 32:08.025
- Freamon?
- All right, man,
take care.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.093
- We tell daniels.
- Fuck daniels

32:10.095 --> 32:13.230
And his fucking
ass-kissing, up-the-chain-
of-command ambition.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.299
What other choice
do you got, huh?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.601
We go to daniels.
If he fights, he fights.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.569
If he gives
it up to rawls,
then fuck it,

32:19.571 --> 32:22.372
We were never gonna do
the case anyway.

32:24.677 --> 32:27.177
All right, come on.

32:40.326 --> 32:44.394
<i> ( rock music playing )</i>

33:01.046 --> 33:02.179
Oh, god.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.415
Fucking idiot!

33:06.752 --> 33:09.019
Come on, get up,
stupid, let's go.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.153
I'm hurt, man,
i'm hurt.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.022
<i> What are you doing?</i>
<i> Leave me alone.</i>

33:12.024 --> 33:13.290
What are you on,
dope or something?

33:13.292 --> 33:15.192
- Mostly, yeah.
- Come on, get up,
get up.

33:15.194 --> 33:19.229
Oh, ow! You tryin'
to rip out my guts
or something, man?

33:19.231 --> 33:21.298
You tryin'
to kill me, man?

33:21.300 --> 33:24.101
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

33:24.103 --> 33:25.235
Buddy,
i gotta get help.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.170
You can't. You can't
leave me here, man.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.572
You gotta stay with me.
Stay with me.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.474
All right, let me get you
over to the curb.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.576
Go get help, man,
what are you doing?

33:32.578 --> 33:36.279
- Stay there, stay there.
-<i> Aw, christ.</i>

33:36.281 --> 33:38.115
Damn, boy, that all
come out of you?

33:38.117 --> 33:42.119
- Onion soup, campbell's.
- Yeah, come on.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.187
<i> Run, forrest, run.</i>

33:45.224 --> 33:49.326
You could go to forester,
or the deputy ops.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.261
Why come crying
to me?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.596
Why not go to your friend
the judge?

33:52.598 --> 33:55.499
I don't see a circuit court
judge being able to argue

33:55.501 --> 33:58.769
The city homicide commander
out of three murders,

33:58.771 --> 34:00.670
Even if the cases
are all weak sisters.

<i> It's put up or shut up</i>
<i> time, lieutenant.</i>

34:02.708 --> 34:05.308
Either you step up
or you send us all home.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.376
So, this is on me?

34:06.378 --> 34:10.547
I don't see anyone else
in charge of this detail.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.082
Rawls is a major.

34:12.084 --> 34:14.518
<i> Rawls is an asshole.</i>

34:14.520 --> 34:17.454
My point is,
he ranks me on this.

Look, all right.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.532

35 cent a foot.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.368
And that's all
in respect i have
for y'all.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.837
What y'all tryin'
to do in the our
community with these,

37:53.839 --> 37:56.306
These quality
domiciles here.

37:56.308 --> 38:00.310

take it or leave it.

38:03.615 --> 38:07.851
I understand the interest
in clearing these cases, i do.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.353
But charging
those murders now,

38:10.355 --> 38:11.588
And putting
the information

38:11.590 --> 38:13.356
That we have into
the charging documents.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.026
I just call 'em like
i see 'em, lieutenant.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.560
Three murders,
same gun.

38:17.562 --> 38:20.897
We got this barksdale kid
right at the scene on the one.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.599

38:22.601 --> 38:23.867
We're starting
to pull good information.

38:23.869 --> 38:28.538
You charge these
prematurely and barksdale
will change up on us.

The work
we've already done.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.676
I can't tell you how to run
your case, lieutenant.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.911

38:43.088 --> 38:44.988
Yes, sir, a favor.

<i> No!</i>

38:55.634 --> 38:57.834
You got off
from work early today.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.337
Yep, work sucks.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.972
Are we eating dinner
with you?

39:02.974 --> 39:04.874
Why not?

39:05.377 --> 39:06.710
Mom was
cooking lasagna.

39:06.712 --> 39:11.448
So, we'll go to little italy,
get some lasagna at sabs.

We creep back in
there and steal that
shit right back.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.031

You good?

40:46.845 --> 40:49.979
I could top off

40:49.981 --> 40:52.882
Just one,
just one more.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.558

42:45.864 --> 42:47.697
You know,
what you should do,

42:47.699 --> 42:48.932
You should take
the whole roll

42:48.934 --> 42:51.034
And go do somethin'
nice for your girl.

42:51.036 --> 42:53.970
You do have
a girl, right?

42:54.706 --> 42:55.905
Yeah, well, anyway,

42:55.907 --> 42:59.709
You got enough money
to get yourself one now.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.713
Yo, why you punk sterling
like you did?

43:03.715 --> 43:06.749
I mean, he did get shot
behind this shit.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.318
I didn't
punk him, yo.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.687
So, why you drop him
to lookout?

43:10.689 --> 43:11.955
Cass, too.

43:11.957 --> 43:14.257
'cause they
was thieving, yo.

43:14.259 --> 43:15.758
Both of them.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.760
They got pissed
'cause i wasn't
paying them.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.663
So, sterling,
he started shaking
up the vials,

43:20.665 --> 43:21.931
Handing off to cass.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.167
She was selling
on the side.

43:29.808 --> 43:32.141
If i tell 'em,
what you think
they gonna do?

43:32.143 --> 43:34.777
They gonna take
a baseball bat
to sterling.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.613
Probably one
to cassandra, too.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.081
There's too much drama,
right?

43:38.083 --> 43:41.684
So, i just took 'em
both off the stash.

43:41.686 --> 43:44.988
So, why didn't
you pay us?

43:45.957 --> 43:48.191
That wasn't right.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.126
Listen, man.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.962
Stringer thought
we had a snitch down here.

You know, with the jumpout,
omar, all that shit.

43:57.235 --> 44:00.370

still holdin' money at

49:27.699 --> 49:29.966
You got an incoming call
to d'angelo barksdale's

49:29.968 --> 49:31.500
Giving him the number
of a pay phone,

49:31.502 --> 49:35.371
Westside exchange,
numbers encoded, right?

49:35.373 --> 49:36.305
Three minutes later,

49:36.307 --> 49:39.508
You get another call from
the low-rises to that number.

49:39.510 --> 49:42.211
Then a half a minute later
you get another call

49:42.213 --> 49:44.180
From the low rises
to a pager number

49:44.182 --> 49:46.048
We know is
stringer bell's.

49:46.050 --> 49:47.016
Well, i'll be damned.

49:47.018 --> 49:50.619
Finally, you get another call,
probably from a pay phone,

49:50.621 --> 49:52.388
Probably stringer bell
calling back

49:52.390 --> 49:54.390
Coming on into
the low rise courts.

49:54.392 --> 49:57.560
45 minutes later,
another call,

49:57.562 --> 50:02.298
<i> This one from</i>
<i> the same pay phone that</i>
<i> went to d'angelo's pager</i>

50:02.300 --> 50:05.001

whole damn thing off.
You see that?

50:05.003 --> 50:06.469
This is the murder,
right here.

This first number,
the one they sent
to d'angelo,

50:09.607 --> 50:14.443

comes from a pay phone
over by the greek's.

before the murder.

50:28.159 --> 50:29.358
It's all here
on the pen registers.

50:29.360 --> 50:32.561
This one calling that one,
that one calling back.

50:32.563 --> 50:35.164
We're up on those pay phones
when we should be,

50:35.166 --> 50:36.265
And we have them cold.

50:36.267 --> 50:38.067
But we're not up
in time, are we?

50:38.069 --> 50:41.237

You saw him
get arrested?

51:13.738 --> 51:15.071
On tuesday?

51:15.073 --> 51:16.672
Tuesday, tuesday,
yes, yes, tuesday.

51:16.674 --> 51:19.275
By the police?
The police arrested him?

51:19.277 --> 51:21.811
Cuffs,
they handcuffed him.

51:21.813 --> 51:23.579
Mmm.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.581
How about
these guys?

51:25.583 --> 51:28.250
Were they there
with him?

51:28.252 --> 51:30.219
No, no.

51:30.221 --> 51:31.353
No?

51:31.355 --> 51:35.191
<i>No, he fight,</i>
<i> you arrest.</i>

51:35.193 --> 51:37.660
<i> Thank you, sir.</i>

51:37.662 --> 51:39.695
<i> Thank you.</i>

51:45.470 --> 51:48.237
It's a match.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.140
No.

51:51.142 --> 51:53.109
I need help.
Rawls ranks me.

51:53.111 --> 51:56.779
Lieutenant, think
what you're doing here.

51:56.781 --> 51:58.781
You're gonna
cross bill rawls,

51:58.783 --> 52:03.385
As ruthless a fuck
as we have in this
department,

52:03.387 --> 52:06.388
<i> And to do what?</i>

52:06.390 --> 52:11.260
To fight for a case
the deputy of operations
doesn't even want.

52:12.430 --> 52:13.562
No.

52:13.564 --> 52:17.800
I like my career,
thank you very much.

52:19.537 --> 52:21.604
Greggs:
<i>In the cemetery,</i>
<i>you were telling us a guy</i>

52:21.606 --> 52:24.240
<i>By the name of bird</i>
<i>killed the working man?</i>

52:24.242 --> 52:27.543
Omar:
<i> Yeah, that man</i>
<i> who testified.</i>

52:27.545 --> 52:29.578
<i>William gant, right.</i>

52:29.580 --> 52:31.847
Yeah, bird did that one,
for sure.

52:31.849 --> 52:34.817
- How you know?
- Everybody know, man.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.218
Nigga walked up
behind the man

52:36.220 --> 52:37.520
And shot him
straight in the head.

52:37.522 --> 52:39.855
The whole blessed
projects saw that much.

52:39.857 --> 52:41.924
And bird worked
for avon?

52:41.926 --> 52:43.459
Yeah, as one
a his shooters.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.861
Liked to use this
real sweet gun he got.

52:45.863 --> 52:48.330
A 380 from austria
or australia,

52:48.332 --> 52:49.498
Or something like that.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.734
But i know
he love that gun.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.536
- A 380?
- Yeah, a 380.

52:53.538 --> 52:54.770
You get him,
you get the gun,

52:54.772 --> 52:57.606
'cause bird too dumb
to throw a gun like
that off.

52:57.608 --> 52:59.808
- A gun alone ain't enough.
- Oh, no?

52:59.810 --> 53:03.345
He goes to court,
testifies he bought
the gun on the street

53:03.347 --> 53:04.313
After gant was killed.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.315
Come on, now,
so, what be enough then?

53:06.317 --> 53:07.249
Eyeball witness.

53:07.251 --> 53:11.620
Some kind of corroboration
for what you're telling me here.

53:13.891 --> 53:16.792
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

53:16.794 --> 53:18.360
I'm your man.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.229
You saw the murder?

53:20.231 --> 53:21.463
Yeah.

53:21.465 --> 53:24.633
You can id this man bird
as the shooter of william gant?

53:24.635 --> 53:27.703
And you ain't afraid
to go into the court downtown

53:27.705 --> 53:31.974
And testify against
one of barksdale's people?

53:32.610 --> 53:35.411
Omar don't scare.

53:35.913 --> 53:38.380
The fact is that while
lieutenant daniels

53:38.382 --> 53:40.282
And his merry band
are lost in the swamps,

53:40.284 --> 53:43.919
Playing with beepers
and pay phones and body mikes,

53:43.921 --> 53:45.621
My people have
developed information

53:45.623 --> 53:47.556
That ties barksdale
to three killings.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.325
D'angelo barksdale,
not avon.

53:49.327 --> 53:51.260
D'angelo,
on behalf of avon.

53:51.262 --> 53:52.728
The victim is identified
by our witness

53:52.730 --> 53:55.864
As being involved
with avon barksdale.

53:55.866 --> 53:58.467
Sir, we're developing
information.

53:58.469 --> 54:00.836
You're dancing
around this thing.

54:00.838 --> 54:02.371
I'm charging
three murders.

54:02.373 --> 54:06.008
You charge those cases,
my investigation folds.

54:06.010 --> 54:07.576
And what's more,
not one of those cases

54:07.578 --> 54:09.345
Is strong enough for court.
You know that.

54:09.347 --> 54:10.913
So, we bring
the barksdale kid in,

54:10.915 --> 54:14.717
Throw a little mindfuck
at him and the case
becomes stronger.

54:14.719 --> 54:16.352
You've had him
in the box twice before.

54:16.354 --> 54:18.387
He's gonna go for less
the third time around.

54:18.389 --> 54:22.424
So, we recanvass,
develop fresh witnesses.

54:22.426 --> 54:23.659
The case
i charge on today

54:23.661 --> 54:26.528
Can be twice as strong
by the trial date.

54:26.530 --> 54:27.696
<i> We get a conviction,</i>

54:27.698 --> 54:31.634
We roll little boy barksdale
into big boy barksdale,

54:31.636 --> 54:35.404
Then we go home like
good old-fashioned cops

54:35.406 --> 54:38.274
And pound
some budweiser.

54:38.276 --> 54:40.676
This...

54:40.678 --> 54:42.811
Is bullshit!

54:42.813 --> 54:44.446
It was
mcnulty himself

54:44.448 --> 54:46.348
Who made the ballistics
match on these murders

54:46.350 --> 54:47.850
And he's telling me
to fight this.

54:47.852 --> 54:50.286
<i>He knows you don't have</i>
<i>a viable prosecution.</i>

54:50.288 --> 54:52.688
So do you,
so do i.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.590
Enough!

54:55.926 --> 54:59.728
Look, i've got no love
for your wiretap, lieutenant.

54:59.730 --> 55:04.300
I'm spending 2,000 a day
over the unit operating budget

55:04.302 --> 55:05.901
To staff the case.

55:05.903 --> 55:07.770
And major rawls here
is offering a chance

55:07.772 --> 55:11.774
To leverage barksdale
through a murder prosecution.

55:11.776 --> 55:13.909
Why not jump on this?

55:13.911 --> 55:17.579
Because if
major rawls is right,

55:17.581 --> 55:20.816
Then he will be just
as right a month from now.

55:20.818 --> 55:23.085
And if the wire
doesn't give us a case,

55:23.087 --> 55:25.554
He can charge all
the murders he has.

55:25.556 --> 55:26.855
We lose nothing.

55:26.857 --> 55:30.025
But if he's wrong,
if he can't convict,

55:30.027 --> 55:32.528
Or if the barksdale kid
doesn't flip,

55:32.530 --> 55:34.997
Then it's too late
to do anything else.

55:34.999 --> 55:39.668
Avon barksdale
changes up his pattern
and the wiretap dies.

55:39.670 --> 55:42.071
And at that point,
there isn't gonna
be a thing

55:42.073 --> 55:44.740
That you or me
or rawls here

55:44.742 --> 55:48.444
Is gonna be able to say
to that goddamn judge.

55:55.619 --> 55:56.952
<i>You wanted</i>
<i>to see me, major?</i>

55:56.954 --> 56:00.856
Mcnulty does personal
business on the clock,
i want to know.

56:00.858 --> 56:03.625
He cheats on a run sheet,
i want to know.

56:03.627 --> 56:06.495
He runs any kind of game
at all, i want to know.

56:06.497 --> 56:08.931
Major, the man's
an asshole,

56:08.933 --> 56:10.866
But he doesn't do much
other than work.

56:10.868 --> 56:14.470
<i>He's got this fuckin' case</i>
<i>in his gut like it's cancer.</i>

56:14.472 --> 56:16.705
He does no wrong?

56:16.707 --> 56:19.775
He doesn't drink anymore?
Doesn't drink on duty?

56:19.777 --> 56:22.411
Doesn't drink
and drive, detective?

56:22.413 --> 56:23.612
Major...

56:23.614 --> 56:26.448
You gotta help me
on this, michael.

56:46.604 --> 56:50.072
Daniels:
<i>The murder warrants</i>
<i>are on hold.</i>

56:50.074 --> 56:53.609
The deputy gave us
another month.

56:53.611 --> 56:55.811
<i>Also, whoever that was</i>
<i>you brought in here today</i>

56:55.813 --> 56:59.581
Gave himself up
as an eyewitness
in the gant murder.

56:59.583 --> 57:00.482
Who, omar?

57:00.484 --> 57:04.953
And greggs said
to tell you she'd write
it up in the morning.

57:06.624 --> 57:09.057
Lieutenant.

57:09.727 --> 57:12.060
Thanks.

57:17.134 --> 57:19.968
It cost you?

57:22.807 --> 57:26.141
<i> ( music playing )</i>

58:09.653 --> 58:12.955
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>
