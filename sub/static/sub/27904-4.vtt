WEBVTT

00:03.873 --> 00:04.352
Hey.

00:04.395 --> 00:06.223
Hey, honey.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.356
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

00:08.399 --> 00:10.662
This whole area here
is Donny Land.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.621
Don...

00:12.664 --> 00:15.058
she can put her stuff
on your desk.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.060
Well, what if I have
to tell a story?

00:17.104 --> 00:18.279
I talk with my hands.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.238
That's how I paint a picture.

00:21.282 --> 00:26.026
Okay, well, maybe paint a
picture of you working. Hmm?

00:26.069 --> 00:27.288
It'll be a one-of-a-kind.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.332
Come on, honey,

00:28.376 --> 00:30.247
you can put your
stuff over here.

00:30.291 --> 00:33.598
Well, that's sweet, honey,
but, you know, I work here now;

00:33.642 --> 00:36.210
I feel like I should
have my own desk.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.342
I wish we could, but
if we give you a desk,

00:38.386 --> 00:40.866
someone else is gonna
have to give theirs up.

00:40.910 --> 00:43.217
Oh. Hmm. I see.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.263
What?

00:46.307 --> 00:47.699
He's your brother.
She's your wife.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.223
I'm screwed.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.835
Do you know what I had to do
to earn this desk?

00:52.878 --> 00:54.576
Months of dodging
and ducking my way

00:54.619 --> 00:58.101
through this guy's
endless stories.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.017
What are you laughing at?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.585
I don't know.
You made fun of
Don; I liked it.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.893
Lowell, you seem
a bit on edge.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.504
I'm just not giving up
this desk.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.376
It's all I have.
I'm not losing it, not today!

01:12.420 --> 01:14.509
Hey, nobody's
gonna take your desk.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.989
Thank you.
Okay.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.339
Okay, you feel better now?

01:18.382 --> 01:20.776
Yes.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.908
It won't happen again.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.258
Okay.Good.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.912
Who the flip took
my flipping pencil sharpener?!

01:26.956 --> 01:28.958
All right,

01:29.001 --> 01:32.222
L... Lowell,
take it easy.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.920
I don't think you're really mad
about the pencil sharpener

01:34.964 --> 01:36.444
or the desk.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.488
ANDI: Maybe you're
having trouble

01:37.532 --> 01:39.229
adjusting to being single

01:39.273 --> 01:40.752
since you and your wife
split up.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.451
Jeepers.
I never thought of that.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.018
The greatest minds
in the world

01:46.062 --> 01:48.543
have come together
to figure out the obvious!

01:57.726 --> 01:59.684
Is that Lowell's
pencil sharpener?

01:59.728 --> 02:02.296
I couldn't give it back;
I was in too deep.

02:15.178 --> 02:18.007
Mom, I have to build a solar
system for my science class.

02:18.050 --> 02:21.315
Again?
You already know this stuff.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.099
How many planets are
in the solar system?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.101
A billion.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.714
Two?

02:32.978 --> 02:35.677
Okay, we'll work on it
this weekend.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.548
It's due tomorrow.Of course it is.

02:37.592 --> 02:41.161
Okay, well, I-I'll get your dad
to do it when he gets home.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.163
Oh, you know what'll be fun?

02:43.206 --> 02:45.687
I'll say we told him
about it last week.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.126
Hey, guys.
Hi.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.823
So, get this.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.695
Lowell placed an order
with the lumberyard today,

02:53.738 --> 02:55.697
and he got all weepy
when they asked

02:55.740 --> 02:58.265
if we were doing
his-and-hers closets.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.745
He is getting
really good prices, though.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.445
He's too lonely, all by himself
in that apartment.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.055
I got to stop by there
and, well,

03:06.098 --> 03:07.883
see if I can snap him out of it.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.754
Tonight?Mm-hmm.

03:09.798 --> 03:13.454
But...

03:13.497 --> 03:17.849
last week you promised Teddy
you'd build him a solar system.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.462
I know.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.552
I remember.

03:25.727 --> 03:26.858
I listen.

03:30.079 --> 03:33.038
But shouldn't you do this one?
I mean, last night

03:33.082 --> 03:36.390
I had to clean dog poop
off of Emme's shoe, again.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.521
I think she

03:37.565 --> 03:40.132
just jumps from pile to pile.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.700
Well, while you

03:42.744 --> 03:45.399
were cleaning her shoes,
I hemmed Kate's band uniform

03:45.442 --> 03:47.270
to make it shorter.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.054
Longer.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.057
I made it longer,
like a pilgrim.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.930
All right,

03:54.973 --> 03:56.801
forget Lowell--
I'll do the solar system.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.890
I already got it all
planned out, because I've

03:58.934 --> 04:01.806
been thinking about ever since
you mentioned it last week.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.376
No. I like that you want
to go check on your friend,

04:06.420 --> 04:08.813
so I will create the universe.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.816
A woman probably did it anyway.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.644
Man, you guys are too busy.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.604
The only thing I did last night
was binge-watch Fantasy Island.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.822
And all I can say is,

04:17.866 --> 04:19.911
be careful what you wish for.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.178
Heh. That sounds
like a night, huh?Hmm.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.963
Mindless, pointless fun?

04:28.006 --> 04:30.313
Do you remember
how much fun fun was?

04:30.357 --> 04:32.794
Yeah.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.970
You know, sometimes I
see old pictures of us,

04:35.013 --> 04:38.147
and I think: What are
they smiling about?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.757
Don't they know
what's coming?

04:39.801 --> 04:40.715
Right?

04:42.717 --> 04:43.979
LOWELL:
I'm so glad you dropped by.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.023
Yeah.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.243
Let me just close
my bedroom door.

04:50.246 --> 04:53.771
Well, now the place
looks huge.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.078
Can you hear me over there?

04:56.121 --> 04:58.123
Sit down, make
yourself at home.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.829
This is cozy.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.832
The saleslady at the store
said it was a love seat.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.226
Then I said,
"I love you, too."

05:14.270 --> 05:15.750
Then I kind of had
to buy it.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.013
Look, Lowell,

05:18.056 --> 05:21.059
I know you're going through
a tough time, but...

05:21.103 --> 05:24.672
your mood is creating
a weird work vibe.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.239
Is it the crying?
The yelling?

05:27.283 --> 05:29.764
I think it's the combo platter,
my friend.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.026
Oh, come on,

05:31.069 --> 05:32.288
it's not all bad.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.855
You got your own place here.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.900
You could do whatever you want.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.075
Like what?

05:38.729 --> 05:40.949
That is a great question.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.125
Uh, well, what were you doing
before I got here?

05:43.168 --> 05:44.866
Well, I open and close
the bed a lot.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.957
Fun.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.916
Hey, Don. Don's here.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.701
He'll lighten things up.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.224
Don, lighten things up.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.269
What brings you by,
fair traveler?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.837
Well, I went home,
and you know what I realized?

05:59.881 --> 06:00.882
My wife lives there.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.710
So, I, uh,

06:02.753 --> 06:04.755
grabbed some beer and snacks,
and here I am.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.018
See, Lowell?
It's all coming together.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.411
We got food,
we got beverages.

06:08.455 --> 06:12.328
Now we just need something
to do... besides talking.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.331
Hey. What's this hole?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.116
I tried to hang a picture, but
I was madder than I thought.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.597
Well, I think we
can do something with that.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.643
That's my light bill.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.645
No, no, we'll make
a game out of this.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.648
Okay, if you get the ball
in the hole from here,

06:27.691 --> 06:30.564
that's one point.And if you make it from here,
it's two points.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.956
Ah.And if you

06:32.000 --> 06:34.959
don't get in the hole,
it's no points.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.440
All right,
I like that you're trying.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.053
Yes!

06:42.097 --> 06:44.969
Nothin' but hole.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.667
This is so fun!

06:46.710 --> 06:49.931
But we lost the ball;
now what do we do?Dang it, Adam!

06:57.721 --> 06:59.549
Automatic ball return.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.944
Gentlemen, I think
we just invented a sport.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.295
This is a masterpiece.

07:06.338 --> 07:09.907
This is definitely gonna make
the front table at open house.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.953
Yeah. It looks good.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.085
So, is it time to paint Uranus?

07:18.089 --> 07:20.527
Teddy, you've been
doing that all night.

07:20.570 --> 07:21.876
You're right. I'm sorry.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.226
But Uranus has
a weird bump on it.

07:26.750 --> 07:27.751
Miss it.

07:27.795 --> 07:28.883
Miss it. Mi...

07:28.926 --> 07:30.101
Yes!

07:32.147 --> 07:33.496
What are you doing, Don?
Follow through!

07:33.540 --> 07:35.933
All right, good game.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.935
I should get going
and help with Teddy's project.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.284
I'm glad you're
feeling better, Lowell.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.677
This was surprisingly fun.

07:40.721 --> 07:41.809
It really was.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.637
I mean, you invented a game

07:43.680 --> 07:46.074
you can only play
in my apartment.Mm-hmm.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.510
That makes me the hub.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.512
I'm the hub of the wheel.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.906
You can't leave.
I demand a rematch.

07:51.949 --> 07:55.126
Well, I would, because I am at
the peak of my athletic ability,

07:55.170 --> 07:57.085
but I should get home.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.695
Okay, then
tomorrow.Well...

07:58.739 --> 08:01.045
Andi's not gonna let me
come back tomorrow.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.699
I have responsibilities.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.440
Who knows what
she told me last week

08:04.484 --> 08:05.789
that I'm supposed
to do tomorrow?

08:07.661 --> 08:09.576
Okay, fine. Then
we'll-we'll play without you.

08:09.619 --> 08:10.794
What?

08:10.838 --> 08:13.144
You're gonna have fun
without me?

08:13.188 --> 08:14.406
Probably more.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.585
All you really need is the hub.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.108
But...

08:20.151 --> 08:22.023
but I invented the game.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.895
Well, we'll put up a
picture in your memory.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.419
No, no, no.
I'm coming back.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.248
I just have to figure out a way
to work it with Andi.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.685
She only let me come down here

08:31.728 --> 08:33.382
because Lowell's
such a basket case.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.690
Thanks.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.866
Oh. No, that's a...
that's a good thing.

08:38.909 --> 08:39.910
I can use that.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.433
Oh. Then you're welcome.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.568
So, how's Lowell doing?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.004
It is no fun over there,

08:47.048 --> 08:48.571
let me tell ya.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.662
I even had
to bring Don in to help.

08:52.706 --> 08:55.143
And Lowell wants me to come back
again tomorrow, but...

08:55.186 --> 08:56.927
Hmm.I couldn't do that.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.147
Could I?

08:59.190 --> 09:01.976
Maybe you should bring him
over here.

09:05.893 --> 09:09.549
That... is an idea
I did not see coming.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.466
Oh, but, no,
I'm afraid it'd remind him

09:14.510 --> 09:16.730
of everything
he used to have...

09:18.688 --> 09:20.516
You know what?
He'll be fine.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.257
The hell with him.Oh, no, no.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.346
Wait a minute.
I mean, he's your friend.

09:24.389 --> 09:27.305
You need to be there for him.
You should go back tomorrow.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.090
Wha...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
Well, if you're
gonna force me to,

09:33.616 --> 09:35.139
fine, I'll go.

09:36.445 --> 09:39.840
When will I ever get
a minute for myself?

09:50.459 --> 09:52.069
So, check out
this standing desk.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.158
It takes up less space
than a regular desk,

09:54.202 --> 09:57.858
and then if you're sitting,
I can hover right over you.Uh-huh.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.729
L-Let's keep thinking.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.644
There's just no room in here.

10:01.688 --> 10:05.126
I can't hang you
from the ceiling like a bat.

10:05.169 --> 10:08.782
I can't believe this. My pencil
sharpener's missing again.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.479
Don, cough it up.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.395
Fine.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.658
But you should know I sharpened
a carrot in here earlier,

10:15.702 --> 10:18.052
so it may be a little slow.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.488
Sharpen whatever you want, Don.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.229
What's mine is yours.

10:21.272 --> 10:24.406
Hey, Lowell seems better.Mm-hmm.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.147
I guess you get to stay home
with me tonight.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.890
Great. What a happy surprise.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.457
All right, well, I have to go
fill out these purchase orders,

10:32.501 --> 10:36.026
so I guess I'll go do it
in the shovel of the bulldozer.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.508
If they raise me up, it'll be
like a penthouse office.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.469
What are you doing, man?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.341
Sad it up.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.648
If Andi doesn't think you're
a mess, my game nights are over.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.127
Well, I don't want that.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.476
When you're not there,
Don cheats.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.262
Every time I try to shoot,
he tickles me.

10:54.305 --> 10:57.352
Victory at any cost.
That's what makes a champion.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.485
My pen fell in the engine.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.011
I hope that's gonna be okay.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.708
Uh, Lowell, I'm just gonna
borrow one of yours.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.755
Oh, Lowell won't mind.
Right, Lowell?

11:08.798 --> 11:11.148
I do mind.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.672
How dare you?

11:12.715 --> 11:13.803
What?

11:13.847 --> 11:16.284
Why is everybody always
taking my stuff?

11:16.327 --> 11:19.069
You just said y-your
stuff was our stuff.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.592
Feelings don't make sense, Andi.

11:20.636 --> 11:24.553
I'm gonna go find a church
and get some soup.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.820
What happened?
I thought he was better.

11:30.864 --> 11:35.259
Looks like I'm gonna have to go
back over there again tonight.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.742
You know what, Adam?
I don't believe you.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.092
You don't?

11:42.136 --> 11:47.097
It's just, you've grown
so much as a person,

11:47.141 --> 11:49.621
I mean, putting your friends
before yourself.

11:49.665 --> 11:52.886
I-I, it... I'm so proud of you.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.496
Oh.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.672
Thanks, honey.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.109
Aww. Mm.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.634
For tonight's match,
I created a signature cocktail

12:02.678 --> 12:04.245
to enjoy during warm-ups.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.550
Oh.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.727
We are getting real classy.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.207
Hey, you know, this could
be a rich guy sport,

12:10.251 --> 12:13.776
like polo
or non-miniature golfing.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.256
Yeah, this could
really catch on.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.866
Uh, but we need a name first.

12:16.910 --> 12:20.696
You don't get on ESPN
without a name.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.132
I like "Wall Ball."

12:22.176 --> 12:25.005
Eh, too rhymey.
We don't want that crowd.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.007
Hmm.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.880
How about "Wall Hole"?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.969
I like it. It tells a story.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.624
Oh, then we can call
my signature drink

12:35.667 --> 12:37.234
an Andy Wall-Hole.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.497
Uh, no, I don't get it.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.803
Well, you know,
like Andy Warhol.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.109
Ah.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.371
Who's that?

12:43.414 --> 12:47.549
Don. Andy Warhol?

12:47.592 --> 12:49.594
From New York?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.118
Plays shortstop for the Mets?

12:52.597 --> 12:54.208
Oh, right, right. Okay.

12:54.251 --> 12:59.039
Ah. Hey, Lowell, see if anyone
owns the name WallHoleUSA.com.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.563
Yeah, we're definitely gonna
want that for the online store.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.260
The money is in the merchandise.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.264
Someone already has
the Wall Hole site,

13:07.308 --> 13:10.659
but the subject matter's
quite disturbing.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.012
Ooh, she was not expecting that.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.709
Oh-- well, maybe she was.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.191
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.237
Dad, what are you doing here?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.456
You're supposed to be home
resting from your knee surgery.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.197
Well, we heard from Don that
you boys had something good

13:27.241 --> 13:31.245
going on over here, so I told
your mother that my nurse, uh...

13:31.288 --> 13:33.508
Oh, my name is Funchy.
You canjust call me that.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.553
Sure thing, Nursey.

13:35.597 --> 13:38.600
Said I should get out of
the house and take a rehab walk.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.169
So, uh, what's going on?

13:42.212 --> 13:46.042
I hope you're throwing something
into that hole.

13:46.086 --> 13:49.089
We need to talk to you.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.046
What's going on?

13:50.090 --> 13:52.048
You tell us. Our husbands

13:52.092 --> 13:54.572
have been over at Lowell's
apartment every night this week.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.878
What are they up to?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.532
They're not up to anything.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.229
They're helping Lowell
during a difficult time.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.145
I'm actually very proud of them.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.234
Bless her little heart.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.977
No, i-it's true.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.675
I-- you should be happy.
Our husbands are good people.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.897
I highly doubt that.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.768
Something's in it for them,

14:16.812 --> 14:18.553
or else they wouldn't
be over there.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.555
No.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.036
Well...

14:24.254 --> 14:27.388
That does sound more like Adam.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.172
Shoot. You know,
I really thought

14:29.216 --> 14:31.174
he was growing as a person.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.176
Honey, they don't do that.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.919
LOWELL:
All right.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.660
We're at match point.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.184
For the first time
in the history of Wall Hole,

14:41.228 --> 14:43.404
a father and son meet
in the playoffs.

14:43.447 --> 14:46.886
Can a family
survive it?

14:49.714 --> 14:50.672
All right.

14:50.715 --> 14:51.934
Yeah!

14:51.978 --> 14:53.936
Dad makes it to the finals.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.199
Even on one leg,
the old man smoked you.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.897
He gets in my head.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.595
I built that head.
I know my way around in there.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.597
Well, I've got winner.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.512
You know, I was getting
burned out on nursing,

15:04.555 --> 15:06.296
but now that I'm a pro athlete,

15:06.340 --> 15:08.342
I've got my passion back.

15:09.952 --> 15:13.173
Ooh, it's Andi.
Uh, everybody shush.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.478
Well, we're starting
a game here.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.306
Look, if I go down,
we all go down.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.961
Uh, how exactly will Igo down?

15:19.005 --> 15:22.312
Well, I--
Just, everybody, shush.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.315
Hey, honey.

15:25.359 --> 15:28.362
No, Lowell's not doing so good.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.712
Friday was his and Jen's
movie night,

15:30.755 --> 15:33.193
so it's bringing up
a lot of feelings.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.283
I think we're gonna watch
all the Harry Potters.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.111
Okay, bye, honey.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.331
Andi has no idea.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.593
It's game on, boys.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.033
Well, he's terrible at this.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.993
He didn't even hang up before
he said "Andi has no idea."

15:51.037 --> 15:52.821
So what's our move?

15:52.864 --> 15:55.519
All I can say is, I've had
pepper spray in my purse

15:55.563 --> 15:59.001
for four years, and I want
to use it before it expires.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.527
That'll be the pizza.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.964
Ooh.All right.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.097
Uh, oh.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.143
I can't believe that Lowell
started feeling better

16:10.186 --> 16:11.274
this very minute.

16:11.318 --> 16:14.321
I say we all go home

16:14.364 --> 16:16.627
to our beautiful wives. Huh?

16:16.671 --> 16:18.760
Oh, hey, ladies.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.850
Didn't see you there.

16:21.893 --> 16:25.854
Yes, I lied about why
I was at Lowell's.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.552
But you ambushed me before
I could cover it up.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.467
So who's really at fault?

16:30.511 --> 16:33.557
You used your friend's
unhappiness

16:33.601 --> 16:36.778
to go out and have fun
and avoid stuff around here.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.781
What? No. I love the
stuff around here.

16:39.824 --> 16:43.350
Or were you trying to avoid me?

16:43.393 --> 16:46.179
No. No.

16:46.222 --> 16:49.051
It was the stuff around here.Mm-hmm.

16:49.095 --> 16:52.054
I mean, you're making up reasons
to go out at night,

16:52.098 --> 16:56.450
and... and... you don't want me
to have a desk at work.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.365
Yeah. It's starting
to come together now,

16:58.408 --> 17:00.454
it's all connected.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.240
No, no, stop connecting things.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.416
Okay? H-Honey, I swear,

17:06.460 --> 17:09.680
this is just about me trying to
get away with something silly.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.292
Well, then,
what's really going on?

17:14.250 --> 17:17.036
Okay, fine. Look-- uh...

17:17.079 --> 17:18.254
I was just trying

17:18.298 --> 17:20.169
to enjoy a little break.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.085
But not from you.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.696
There's school projects

17:25.740 --> 17:30.571
and shoes that need
de-poopifying, and...

17:30.614 --> 17:34.096
and the kids never
turn off a light.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.490
I have probably spent
three years of my life

17:36.533 --> 17:39.362
turning off lights.

17:39.406 --> 17:42.235
I mean, you have to know
what I'm talking about.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.106
No, I don't.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.413
I find every minute
with my children

17:46.456 --> 17:49.372
to be a joy to treasure.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.287
Do you?

17:53.246 --> 17:57.293
Two weeks ago, when you went to
Target to buy Teddy new shorts?

17:57.337 --> 18:00.427
Mm-hmm.
You were gone so
long, I got worried.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.560
Yeah. So I went down there.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.954
And you know who I saw,
drinking an Icee,

18:05.997 --> 18:08.391
watching Dr. Phil
in the TV section?

18:08.435 --> 18:11.220
My long-lost twin sister?

18:11.264 --> 18:14.397
No, it was you, baby.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.705
But I didn't say anything.

18:17.748 --> 18:21.491
I left and let you have
your time because I get it.

18:21.535 --> 18:22.927
And also, to keep in my pocket

18:22.971 --> 18:25.016
in case something
like this came up.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.672
Well, I'm very sorry...
that you found out about that.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.241
You know, we do spend
a lot of time

18:32.285 --> 18:33.416
taking care of other people.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.244
That's all I'm saying.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.246
And since we're coming clean,

18:37.290 --> 18:39.727
I should tell you that time
at Target, it wasn't my first.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.251
They know me there.

18:42.295 --> 18:48.475
They let me use the remote
that controls all 65 TVs.

18:48.518 --> 18:51.347
There's a master remote?Uh-huh.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.349
How big is it? I need
to know how big it is.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.743
Eh, it's not big,
but it's heavy.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.658
Nice.
Yeah.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.356
You see?

19:00.400 --> 19:03.925
Everyone needs to bust
out once in a while.

19:03.968 --> 19:07.624
My mistake was not
busting you out with me.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.584
Aw, that's sweet.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.455
And, you know, maybe I should've

19:12.499 --> 19:15.980
taken you with me
to watch the 65 TVs.

19:16.024 --> 19:19.854
I would like to check
out that remote.

19:19.897 --> 19:24.163
You know, Target's open
for another hour.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.426
Let's do it.
Yeah.

19:26.469 --> 19:29.646
Oh, h-hey, kids, uh,
we're going out to run some

19:29.690 --> 19:31.822
very important adult errands.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.696
Pro tip, if you angle the TVs
just right,

19:35.739 --> 19:39.352
you can watch it
from the bed department.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.484
I am so glad I married you.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.790
Hmm.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.060
Good morning, guys.Hey, morning, honey.

19:52.103 --> 19:55.455
Andi, I know you were upset
with Adam, but this week,

19:55.498 --> 19:56.891
I started to enjoy my new life.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.110
Having the guys there
really did help.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.590
Go tell that to Marcy.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.375
I had to sleep
on the porch swing last night.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.812
Don't worry, Lowell.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.596
Adam and I are good.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.250
All right, well,
I have some paperwork to do,

20:08.294 --> 20:10.818
so if you need me,
I'll be in my bulldozer.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.603
Oh, whoa, whoa, why
would you go out there,

20:13.647 --> 20:15.953
when you can
just do your work here

20:15.997 --> 20:18.565
on your new desk?

20:18.608 --> 20:20.131
Whoa.
Yeah.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.959
I invented the Murphy desk.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.614
The Murphy bed's
hardworking little brother.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.660
Oh, I love it.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.749
Now I'm officially part
of the team.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.620
Thanks, honey.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.144
Hmm, yeah. Wall hole, wall desk.

20:33.188 --> 20:37.540
Man, the "wall" part of my brain
is really firing right now.
