00:06.674 --> 00:07.741
- Chicago Med, we're inbound
with a 24-year-old female,

00:09.543 --> 00:12.580
Cheryl Martin, high-speed
collision on Route 30,

00:12.613 --> 00:14.448
T-boned on the passenger
side.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.651
34 weeks pregnant,
chest and belly pain.

00:17.685 --> 00:21.089
Heart rate 124,
BP 102 over 80.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.057
- Got it.
We'll be waiting.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.525
Dr. Halstead?
- Maggie?

00:24.558 --> 00:26.460
- Incoming helo,
ten minutes out.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.463
[tense music]

- Double cappuccino.

00:59.327 --> 01:03.197
*

01:03.231 --> 01:04.232
- What are you doing
with my phone?

01:04.265 --> 01:06.267
- I'm posting this.

01:08.369 --> 01:15.376

01:31.359 --> 01:38.366

01:51.945 --> 01:54.114
- My little girl...
please...

01:58.386 --> 02:05.459
*

02:15.303 --> 02:16.504
- Baghdad.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.505
- Page OB.
- Got it.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.506
- Maggie.
- Yep.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.740
- Dad?
- I'm here, honey.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.808
- You need an assistant?
- Sure.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.477
- Coming through.
- Need x-rays, chest and pelvis.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.645
- Got it.
- Sir, what is your name?

02:24.678 --> 02:25.713
- Ray.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.648
- Why don't you come with me
and let the doctors

02:27.681 --> 02:28.549
do their work, okay?
This way.

02:28.582 --> 02:32.320
- Dad, Dad, please.
- Stay right here.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.222
He'll be right here, sweetie.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.591
- On my count,
one, two, three.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.193
- I need the ultrasound.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.127
- Should I start
a femoral line?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.763
- I'll do that.
- Okay, get a triple...

02:42.796 --> 02:45.666
- Excuse me.

02:45.699 --> 02:49.537
Lungs are wet.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.539
Belly's soft but tender.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.608
Get a CBC, type and screen,
KB and coags.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.177
If she's RH negative,
give RhoGAM.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.750
- Got good heart tones
and fetal movement.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.452
Baby and placenta
look okay.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.453
- I'm in.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.488
Clear!

03:11.325 --> 03:12.560
Natalie.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.362
- Left hemothorax.
She's bleeding.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.429
- Put in a chest tube
and give her back

03:15.463 --> 03:16.497
all the blood you get out.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.232
- We're going to put a tube
in your chest, okay?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.301
- My baby?
- Won't hurt the baby.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.771
Betadyne, lidocaine.
- I got it.

03:23.804 --> 03:27.675
- [whimpers]

03:27.708 --> 03:29.477
- [breathing heavily]

03:39.287 --> 03:40.288
- I'm in.

03:40.321 --> 03:44.024
- Secure the tube
and let's get her over to CT.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.527
- [panting]

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
- We're taking your daughter up
for a CAT scan; you can come.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.044
- Dr. Rhodes.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.349
Welcome to CT surgery.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.351
- Dr. Latham, thank you.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.653
- I'll be supervising
your fellowship.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.288
- I look forward to it.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.857
- Dr. Downey thought
very highly of you.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.026
I'm curious.
There are rumors.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.261
Did you kill him?

04:23.397 --> 04:24.632
- I'm sorry?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.667
- Did you?

04:28.736 --> 04:32.873
- Well, yes, I killed him and
several other patients as well.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.007
- You're being sarcastic.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.878
- Yes, Dr. Latham.
I am being sarcastic.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.381
- I can see why you might have
found that inappropriate.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.019
Oh, I should tell you...

04:46.053 --> 04:48.422
You weren't my first choice
for this fellowship.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.023
I preferred a young woman
from Groote Schuur,

04:50.057 --> 04:52.993
but I was out-voted.
Hmm.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.396
Such is life.

04:55.429 --> 04:59.066
That being said, I hope
we will work well together.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.841
- Sputum test was negative.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.943
Chest is clear.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.044
Night sweats?

05:11.078 --> 05:13.046
- No.
- Good.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.048
TB's still latent.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.117
- For now.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.389
- No reason it shouldn't
stay that way.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.425
Anything I need to know?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.095
- I worry about Tate
and his son.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.798
- They've been tested, April,
They're negative.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.065
And you're not contagious.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.101
- I know, I know,
but...

05:34.134 --> 05:37.838
- What?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.774
- I just don't feel...

05:40.808 --> 05:42.810
clean.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.749
- New residents settling in?

05:48.782 --> 05:51.452
- Yeah. Now I just got to keep
'em from killing people.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.755
- July 1st is not a good day
to need a hospital.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.524
[chuckles]

05:56.557 --> 05:58.959
- And how are you doing?

05:58.992 --> 06:01.094
- Cleaned out Bert's desk
this morning.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.996
Thought it would make me
feel better.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.099
It didn't.
- Mm.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.469
- Good morning.
- Dr. Choi.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.871
- Our new Chief Resident
will need this.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.073
E.D. staff contact list.
- Thank you.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.174
- Oh, and one more thing.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.978
I know I got the Chief
Resident's gavel here somewhere.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.980
- [chuckles]
- [laughing]

06:20.013 --> 06:21.949
- Funny.
By the way, Maggie,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.484
I've got some ideas
to improve patient flow.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.118
- Oh.
Can't wait to hear about them.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.157
I hate killing their dreams.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.126
- No, you like to let them
hang themselves.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.966
- Morning.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.001
- Hey.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.873
Here are my scheduling sheets.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.207
Last Chief Res gave them
to me.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.076
- Thanks, but I've got
my own system.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.012
How we ran sick bay
on the carrier.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.082
- Hey, Dr. Choi,
I'm taking off.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.451
I texted you I'm switching
shifts with Elise Baker.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.552
- Right, yeah.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.419
- And she also--she called.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.988
She said she's going to be
a little late.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.890
She has to take her kid in
for shots.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.925
- No problem, thanks.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.897
- Sure you don't want
these sheets?

07:09.930 --> 07:13.000
- No, I got it.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.035
- Dr. Choi, we need you.

07:17.671 --> 07:18.972
Chout, talk to me.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.641
- Emmie Miles,
15-year-old girl.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.043
Found unconscious,
suspected opioid overdose.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.945
She appeared to have smoked
a fentanyl patch.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.113
- Okay, we're going to
treatment--

07:26.146 --> 07:27.948
- Six.
I got it, Maggie.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.116
- All right.
- You give her NARCAN?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.218
- Five times.
She responded in the ambo.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.853
Just slid back into overdose.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.221
- All right, let's move her.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.989
On my count.
Ready?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.091
One, two, three.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.993
April, let's give her another
two milligrams NARCAN

07:40.027 --> 07:41.228
and hang a drip.
- Got it.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.263
- Bring her down slowly, don't
want to precipitate withdrawal.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.600
Chout, fentanyl patch.
This girl try to kill herself?

07:46.634 --> 07:48.636
- No idea, Doc.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.244
- Grande quad half-caf
nonfat no whip mocha.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.111
- Not half-caf.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.013
Three shots regular,
one shot decaf.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.584
- Okay.
So what happened to your knee?

08:03.617 --> 08:06.620
- I'm embarrassed to say,
I tripped over a suitcase.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.022
Missed my conference
in Lyon.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.257
At least I got
to practice French

08:10.290 --> 08:13.694
with an orthopedic nurse
from Montreal.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.664
So, Dr. Reese,
the reason why I'm here,

08:16.697 --> 08:19.166
uh, aside from the coffee,
of course,

08:19.199 --> 08:23.203
is that Med has
a residency opening for you.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.707
- I'll take it.
- On my service.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.108
- Psychiatry?
- Enough foam, enough foam.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.243
- Okay.

08:30.277 --> 08:34.147
Um...
Dr. Charles, thank you,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.549
but I've never considered
psychiatry.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.018
I don't think I'm equipped.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.152
- I think you have
all the tools.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.554
You're a problem solver.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.956
You pay attention.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.592
And look at how beautiful
you're making my coffee

08:44.625 --> 08:46.126
despite all my meddling.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.929
- But...I don't know how
to talk to people.

08:48.962 --> 08:52.132
- It's actually more
about listening than talking.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.202
- Grande quad 3/4-caf
nonfat no whip mocha.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.104
- I tell you what.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.072
How about you come
and spend the day with me,

08:59.106 --> 09:02.109
and then see
what you think.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.647
- She has a contained rupture
of the aorta.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.681
A pseudoaneurysm.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.149
- That's how we read it.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.618
- It's leaking.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.653
Let's get her up to
the cath lab, fix it.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.254
- Cheryl's 34 weeks pregnant.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.422
Wouldn't that irradiate
the baby?

09:15.455 --> 09:18.626
- Well, it's not ideal,
but it's very little radiation.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.028
- What about surgery?
- That's the other option.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.129
- We'd have to put her
on bypass.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.664
We can't protect
the baby's heart rate.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.933
- So let's give her
a c-section.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.900
Take the baby
out of the equation.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.169
- No. She could still carry
this baby to term.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.004
- Natalie, you are very
concerned about the baby,

09:31.038 --> 09:31.905
but what about the mother?

09:31.939 --> 09:35.108
She is lying there
with an aortic injury.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.748
- [breathing heavily]

09:40.781 --> 09:42.182
Honey.
- Dad.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.685
- Your daughter has some damage
to her aorta.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.754
It's what we call
a pseudoaneurysm.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.056
And it caused a leak
in the vessel wall.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.292
- Sometimes a leak like this
will stop on its own.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.961
If that's the case,
then Cheryl will be able

09:53.994 --> 09:55.963
to carry the baby to term.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.965
So at this point, we're just
going to wait and watch.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.199
- We're going to take her up
to the ICU

09:59.232 --> 10:01.001
where we can keep
a close eye on her.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.337
- Whatever you think is best.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.174
Oh, my chest.
Oh!

10:07.207 --> 10:08.275
- Mr. Buckner?
- Daddy!

10:08.308 --> 10:10.243
- He's having an M.I.
- Dad?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.212
- Oh, oh.
- Daddy, what's happening?

10:12.245 --> 10:13.113
- No pulse.
Code blue!

10:13.146 --> 10:14.982
Radiology hallway!
We need a crash cart.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.083
- Yes, Doctor.
- Daddy!

10:16.116 --> 10:17.985
- We're going to take care
of him; just lie still.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.087
Just stay here.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.122
- Nat, get a quick look.
- [crying]

10:29.830 --> 10:32.365
- He's in v-fib.
Charge to 200.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.267
Hold compressions.
Clear!

10:34.301 --> 10:36.303
- Clear.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.371
- Still in v-fib.
Clear!

10:38.405 --> 10:40.708
- Clear.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.277
- Daddy.
- Sinus rhythm.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.213
- We got a pulse.
- He's back.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.181
- Let's get him up
to the cath lab now.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.118
On my count. One, two three.
- Daddy. Daddy!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.220
Daddy!

10:54.354 --> 10:57.457
- All right, let's go.

11:12.172 --> 11:12.840
- Morning, Dr. Choi.
- Morning.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.845
- This your fentanyl OD?
- Yes.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.180
- Sarah,
are you back?

11:20.213 --> 11:23.350
- I've invited Dr. Reese
to become a psych resident.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.786
- That's great.
- You think so?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.455
- Absolutely.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.491
I'm a great believer
in psychiatry.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.395
- Huh, interesting.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.232
- Dr. Charles, this is the
patient's mother, Mrs. Miles.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.467
- Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Miles.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.903
This is my colleague,
Dr. Reese.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.404
- I don't understand this.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.273
Emmie doesn't use drugs.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.341
- A fetanyl patch
is a very high dose

11:48.375 --> 11:50.143
of a very strong opioid.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.846
This is a difficult question,
but I have to ask it.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.281
Do you think there's any chance
that your daughter

11:54.314 --> 11:55.883
could have been trying
to take her own life?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.517
- No, absolutely not.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.820
She's very popular.
She has hundreds of friends.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.488
She has no reason
to kill herself.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.090
- Do you have any idea how she
might have gotten

12:03.123 --> 12:05.759
hold of the patch?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.861
- My mother has cancer.

12:07.895 --> 12:11.131
She's prescribed fentanyl
patches for pain.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.366
I suppose she could--

12:13.400 --> 12:17.805
- Would you mind
if we talk with her for a bit?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.940
- Please.
Go ahead.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.109
- Thank you.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.348
Honey, I'll be back
in a couple of minutes, hmm?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.256
- Hi, Emmie,
how are you feeling?

12:36.289 --> 12:39.426
I'm Dr. Charles.

12:39.459 --> 12:43.230
- And I'm Dr. Reese.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.465
- Can you tell us
what happened today?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.968
- Leave me alone.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.837
- We're concerned about you,
Emmie.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.371
And we need to understand
what happened

12:51.404 --> 12:54.407
so that we can take care
of you.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.443
- We just want to help.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.821
- You know what?
Why don't we come back later.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.323
And maybe you'll feel
like talking then.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.266
You know who the most unhappy
people in the world are?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.234
- Hmm?
- 15-year-old girls.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.836
- I remember.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.905
- Mom said Emmie had
hundreds of friends.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.274
Hyperbole?
- Maybe not.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.177
She could have hundreds
of friends.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.378
- Oh, like that.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.880
- Girls her age
share everything.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.415
They judge everything.
Maybe Emmie was shamed,

13:35.448 --> 13:37.284
and that led
to a suicide attempt.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.819
- Let me know what you find.
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.427
- Nice bunch of newbies.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.628
- [chuckles]

13:48.661 --> 13:51.564
- Maybe even the Ice Princess
will finally find somebody.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.300
- The "Ice Princess"?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.336
- Yeah, Dr. Manning,
who else?

13:59.472 --> 14:03.443
- Just a princess?
Why not the Ice Queen?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.478
- It was a joke.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.353
[whispering]
It was a joke.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.388
- Dr. Halstead.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.433
HR informed me that you
still haven't supplied them

14:26.466 --> 14:28.501
with current malpractice
insurance.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.337
- Well, I'm trying
to find a carrier

14:30.370 --> 14:31.304
that will write me
a policy.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.340
- I'm guessing that's because
of the lawsuit.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.342
- Doesn't make sense.
The suit was dropped.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.379
- But to an insurance company,
you still look like a bad risk.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.283
Attending physicians
must provide

14:43.316 --> 14:45.385
their own malpractice
insurance.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.989
Now, the hospital could give you
a grace period of two weeks,

14:49.022 --> 14:51.358
but after that--
- I understand.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.694
- Look, I know you and I
have had our ups and downs,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.998
but I don't want
to lose you.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.467
So I'll make a few calls.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.668
- Thank you.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.470
- You may not want
to thank me.

15:03.503 --> 15:07.507
I guarantee, your insurance
will not come cheap.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.380
- Courtney?
- 33-year-old male,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.315
peds versus auto,
GCS 15.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.584
Bruising to the right orbit,
no loss of consciousness.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.019
- All right, wait a second.
Dr. Choi.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.720
- Got a GSW in Baghdad.
Where's Baker?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.689
- Took her kid in for shots,
remember?

15:22.722 --> 15:25.058
- I'll take it.
- What room, Dr. Choi?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.659
- Trauma 3.
- You heard your Chief Resident.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.428
Let's go.
- It's--it's occupied.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.463
- Dr. Choi.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.934
Go to Trauma 2.
Rotate.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.472
- Patient told me
he's HIV positive.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.741
- That's right, be careful.
- No problem.

15:41.774 --> 15:46.546
On my count.
One, two, three.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.415
- Get out.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.682
- Can you tell me
your name, sir?

15:49.716 --> 15:51.351
- Greg Allen.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.986
- Can you tell me
how this happened?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.555
- Crossing the street.
Wasn't looking.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.057
Will somebody please call
my wife?

15:57.090 --> 16:00.493
The number's in my wallet.
- I will.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.595
- Lungs are clear.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.664
- I'll take it from here.
- I got it.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.699
- I'll take it.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.504
Thank you.
- I'm HIV positive.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.607
- Okay.
Follow my finger.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.782
- All right,
retractor's in.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.518
Looks good.

16:25.552 --> 16:29.656
- Let's harvest.
Check the LIMA pulse.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.059
- The LIMA looks small.
How about the saphenous vein?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.127
- No. The left internal
mammary artery

16:34.161 --> 16:35.762
is always the first
and best option.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.497
- I understand.
It's just...

16:37.530 --> 16:40.633
Dr. Downey preferred the
saphenous vein to a small LIMA.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.075
- LIMA pulse is good.
Let's start freeing it up.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.043
- If you're sure.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.779
- Ben Zona!
Al ta'atzben otti!

16:52.812 --> 16:54.747
I know what I'm doing and I
don't like to be contradicted

16:54.781 --> 16:57.517
by a fellow
while I am operating!

17:03.790 --> 17:06.693
[exhales sharply]

17:27.680 --> 17:28.515
- And Emmie does have
hundreds of friends.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.151
623 to be exact.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.819
She's on a lot
of social media platforms.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.622
- 623 friends?
Yikes.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.390
Who do you invite
to the birthday party?

17:37.424 --> 17:40.393
- Mm-hmm. She isn't always
very nice to the other girls.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.628
- Not very nice?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.197
- She wasn't shamed.
She's the shamer.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.732
- Interesting.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.200
Well, so what do you think?

17:47.234 --> 17:50.103
- Maybe...Emmie realized
she really hurt someone,

17:50.137 --> 17:51.504
and she felt guilty.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.606
- Guilty enough
to kill herself?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.508
- Hmm, I don't know.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.210
- You know what?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.779
We got to get Emmie
to open up.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.581
Next time Mom takes a break,

18:01.614 --> 18:04.184
jump in there,
give it another shot.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.153
- Uh, Dr. Charles, wait.
Where are you going?

18:06.186 --> 18:08.655
- Well, I just thought Emmie
might be more comfortable

18:08.688 --> 18:10.623
talking to a woman...

18:10.657 --> 18:12.259
and somebody her own age.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.727
- But I don't know
what to say or what to ask.

18:14.761 --> 18:15.728
- I think that once
you get in there,

18:15.762 --> 18:18.765
you'll discover that you do.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.904
- Thank you.
It's just...

18:24.937 --> 18:26.639
I hate standing around.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.807
I mean, I've had a lot
of experience,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.742
and this guy won't let me
do anything.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.810
I know he's your friend
and I'm sure

18:30.843 --> 18:32.279
he's a really good doctor,
but...

18:32.312 --> 18:35.148
- Mm-hmm.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.184
- I don't know.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.621
- Jeff, can I--
can I ask you something?

18:41.654 --> 18:43.623
- Yeah.

18:43.656 --> 18:47.794
- Do I seem like a--
an ice princess?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.162
- A what?

18:49.196 --> 18:51.164
- A nurse called me
that today.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.767
Do I come across as rigid
or uptight?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.304
- Really?
Come on.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.938
Do you remember back when
the four of us were hanging out?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.641
You were the one who always
kept the party going.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.611
Do you remember that one time
we were at a Greek restaurant?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.945
There was a wedding party
next to us,

19:05.978 --> 19:07.647
and they were breaking plates.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.282
So you got us
to start breaking plates,

19:09.316 --> 19:10.817
and the next thing you know,
you're standing on the table,

19:10.850 --> 19:12.319
and you were waving your arms
and you were yelling, like,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.721
"Opa! Opa!"
You were crazy.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.523
- Oh, my God, yes.
- You remember that?

19:16.556 --> 19:18.625
- The bouzouki player
wanted me to join the band.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.194
- That's right. That was great.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.797
- [laughing]
- Yeah, it really was.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.832
Mmm.

19:31.904 --> 19:36.643
- See, I told you.
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.977
- I still have to be on
antibiotics

19:38.010 --> 19:39.646
for another five months.

19:39.679 --> 19:44.217
- Hey, we--we'll be all clear
by New Year's.

19:44.251 --> 19:47.787
So, tonight,
you're gonna come over.

19:47.820 --> 19:51.691
I'll cook dinner.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.894
- I'll see how I feel
after work.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.929
- Okay.
All right.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.937
You're not contagious,
honey.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.774
- Doesn't hurt to be careful.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.808
- Okay.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.668
- Hey.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.305
How are you feeling?

20:38.338 --> 20:41.974
Your, um, your blood pressure
looks good.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.978
And your heart rate--
- Are you a shrink?

20:46.012 --> 20:49.649
- Uh, no.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.284
I'm barely a doctor.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.920
I just graduated
medical school.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.627
I was, uh, checking out
your Instagram photos.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.928
[chuckles]

21:01.961 --> 21:06.666
And you look
really beautiful.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.835
I always hate the way
I look in photos.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.737
- Yeah.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.071
You need to take a lot.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.740
- You do?

21:13.773 --> 21:16.843
- I took about 100
to get that one.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.411
- Oh.

21:18.445 --> 21:22.382
- I have to look perfect
or I won't send it.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.320
You've been reading
my tweets too?

21:27.354 --> 21:29.322
- Mm-hmm.

21:29.356 --> 21:33.760
- You must think
I'm a horrible person.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.994
- Why would I think that?

21:35.027 --> 21:37.697
- 'Cause of what I say
about other girls.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.799
- No.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.834
No, I, um...

21:46.706 --> 21:51.878
I just think you're under
a lot of pressure to be perfect.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.647
- Oh, God.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.684
- Emmie?
- I'm not--I'm not perfect.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.458
- Emmie, nobody is.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.661
- You don't understand.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.468
Look.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.973
It's vitiligo.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.810
I Googled it.
You can't cure it.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.845
It's gonna spread
all over my body.

22:25.878 --> 22:29.482
Every--everybody's gonna
make fun of me.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.785
My life is ruined.
[sobbing]

22:32.819 --> 22:36.055
- Emmie, did you try
to kill yourself?

22:36.088 --> 22:38.157
- I don't know.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.059
- You don't know?

22:40.092 --> 22:44.531
- I just--I just wanted it
all to go away.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.700
[sobbing]

22:49.469 --> 22:52.004
- I'm gonna take
a skin scraping; is that okay?

23:02.815 --> 23:06.819
- He extubated easily,
and the graft is in.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.821
You were right
about using the LIMA.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.557
- True,
but he's hemolyzing.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.492
His urine output
is marginal and pink.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.795
- Neither's uncommon
after being on pump.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.164
Nothing to suggest
he won't make a full recovery.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.800
- There's also nothing
to suggest he will.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.938
- Dr. Latham.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.443
Um...

23:30.477 --> 23:32.979
I realize, like every doctor
who teaches here,

23:33.012 --> 23:36.583
you have your own methods.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.118
But, I assume,
if I have an opinion,

23:39.151 --> 23:40.119
you'd like to hear it.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.988
- Well, of course.
Why?

23:42.021 --> 23:47.059
- Well, it's just that you
seemed very upset in the O.R.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.861
- Did I?

23:48.895 --> 23:51.864
- Yes.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.900
- I'm not upset.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.941
- I can't see!
Help me!

24:01.974 --> 24:03.042
- Mr. Allen?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.243
- I can see out of
my right eye.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.913
- Dr. Wheeler!

24:06.946 --> 24:09.115
- I can't see out of
my right eye!

24:09.148 --> 24:10.950
- The CT showed a hematoma.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.052
Check the intraocular pressure.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.187
- Where's my wife?
- She's on her way.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.823
- Pressure's high.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.124
He's got a retrobulbar
hemorrhage.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.059
- He needs a lateral
canthotomy.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.894
- The patient
is HIV positive.

24:21.928 --> 24:22.929
- Now,
or he'll lose the eye.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.031
- [whimpering]
Help me.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.067
- Clamp.
- [whimpering]

24:30.169 --> 24:32.004
- Here.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.577
- Surgical scissors.
- Here.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.613
- [whimpering]

24:45.552 --> 24:48.555
[moaning]

24:52.992 --> 24:54.827
[breathing heavily]

24:54.861 --> 24:56.228
- Your vision will return
in a little while.

25:11.911 --> 25:12.945
- Did Dr. Wheeler tell you
to perform that procedure?

25:14.113 --> 25:15.081
- It was an emergency.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.083
The patient could have
gone blind in that eye.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.085
- Then why didn't Dr. Wheeler
perform it?

25:19.118 --> 25:20.753
- You'll have to ask
Dr. Wheeler.

25:20.787 --> 25:21.788
- You're a medical student.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.723
You're not allowed to do
an invasive procedure

25:23.756 --> 25:27.093
unless ordered to do so
by a doctor.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.028
- I've done a lateral
canthotomy

25:29.061 --> 25:30.162
the third year on optho.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.063
- You're not on optho.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.232
You're in the E.D.,
and there are rules.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.967
And unless you figure that out,
you're gonna get yourself

25:35.001 --> 25:37.837
kicked out of here
and med school.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.873
You understand?

25:40.907 --> 25:42.909
- I hear you.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.084
- Do you want me
to write him up?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.889
- No.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.864
It's for his own good.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.299
I know what happens
when you don't follow protocol.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.003
It's not personal.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.809
- Why didn't you tell me that
you were coming back to Med?

26:16.843 --> 26:18.144
- I didn't know
until this morning.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.979
- So you'll be back
in the E.D.?

26:20.012 --> 26:22.915
- Uh, not exactly.

26:22.949 --> 26:26.085
Dr. Charles wants me to be
a psych resident.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.286
- You?

26:27.319 --> 26:28.454
- Is that such a shock?

26:28.487 --> 26:31.357
- I just didn't realize that you
had an interest in that.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.059
- I didn't.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.795
I don't.
I...

26:35.828 --> 26:38.397
I don't know.
What do you see?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.399
- I wish people
wouldn't diagnose themselves.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.168
They always screw it up.
- Hmm.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.402
- Your patient doesn't have
vitiligo.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.071
She has tinea veriscolor.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.006
- A yeast infection?
- Yeah.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.341
- That's wonderful.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.378
- You know, I'm gonna miss
the smell of coffee on you.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.822
- It's a little early to tell,
but my initial assessment

27:02.855 --> 27:04.957
is that your father
is doing well post-op.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.894
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.830
- Dr. Rhodes.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.865
- Excuse us.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.844
- You can see.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.412
The leak from her pseudoaneurysm
is increasing.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.980
- I still think
we should watch it.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.949
- Natalie,
if she goes into labor,

27:29.982 --> 27:31.317
it could rupture
and kill her.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.419
We gotta take care
of this now.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.055
We'll take Cheryl
to the Hybrid Room.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.457
I'll shield the baby with
a lead blanket and stent her.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.961
We'll have OB standing by.
If anything goes wrong,

27:41.994 --> 27:44.330
they can perform
an emergency c-section.

27:46.899 --> 27:51.871
Nat, we've got
to deal with this.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.906
- I'll page OB.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.343
[door opens, closes]

27:59.178 --> 28:04.884
[footsteps approaching]

28:04.917 --> 28:05.852
- Doctor?

28:05.885 --> 28:07.419
- I was with his daughter
when he crashed.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.554
How is he?

28:08.587 --> 28:11.023
- Mr. Buckner is in and out
of non-sustained v-tach.

28:11.057 --> 28:14.126
Heart rate spikes to 180.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.327
- How long has it
been going on?

28:15.361 --> 28:16.996
- 15 minutes.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.366
We've started
an amiodarone infusion.

28:20.399 --> 28:24.270
- Should suppress
his arrhythmia.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.305
- Your lips to God's ear.

28:45.491 --> 28:48.260
- Ready to cannulate.

28:50.429 --> 28:54.400
- Seeing decels on the
fetal heart rate down to 110.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.502
- In position
to place the stent.

28:56.535 --> 28:59.238
- Dr. Manning's right.
I don't like that tracing.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.141
- Just a little bit longer.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.011
- Heart rate's down to 100.
[electronic beeping]

29:05.044 --> 29:06.478
96.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.114
- No time.
The baby's in distress.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.482
We have to get her out now.
- Okay.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.958
[indistinct chatter]

29:26.365 --> 29:28.367
- Last heart rate was 85.

29:38.177 --> 29:41.013
- Cut the cord.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.049
Dr. Manning.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.027
She's all yours, Dr. Rhodes.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.529
- Okay, fluoro on.
Let's go.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.569
I'm not hearing anything.
How's the baby?

30:03.602 --> 30:05.537
- First APGAR 6
but already improving.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.607
How's mom?
- Hanging in there.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.010
Placing the stent now.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.045
And deploy.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.250
It's in.
Well-seated.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.286
- [crying]

30:30.096 --> 30:32.164
- His creatinine levels
hit 2.5.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.599
- Is he responding
to diuretics?

30:33.632 --> 30:35.134
- No.
- [exhales sharply]

30:35.167 --> 30:37.069
I'm not sure why
his kidneys aren't working.

30:37.103 --> 30:40.272
Possibly post CPR
and pump.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.308
Call renal, see what
the nephrologists suggest.

30:55.187 --> 30:55.922
- Your little girl
is doing just fine.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.526
- Oh, look at you.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.929
Oh, thank you.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.140
- Cheryl.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.243
I'm afraid your father
is not doing very well.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.410
- What do you mean?

31:18.444 --> 31:20.212
- I'm gonna go check on him.

31:20.246 --> 31:23.015
I'll let you know.

31:23.049 --> 31:26.152
- Please take me to him.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.254
- Cheryl, you just had
an emergency c-section.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.090
- Take me and my baby.

31:31.123 --> 31:34.326
- I can't do that.
- Please.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.362
My dad.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.571
- Pressure's dropping.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.540
No pulse.
- Call a code.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.076
- Will, start compressions.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.111
- Epi, one milligram.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.284
- Charge to 200.
- Code blue.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.591
- All right,
hold compressions.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.061
Clear.
- Clear.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.562
- Fine v-fib.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.598
- 200 again.
- Charging 200.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.370
- Hold.

32:18.404 --> 32:22.374
Clear.
- Clear.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.410
- Let me do it.

32:27.479 --> 32:31.383
- He's asystole.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.085
He's gone, Connor.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.187
- Vasopressin 40. Now.
[sustained beep]

32:35.221 --> 32:37.223
- Dr. Rhodes,
the patient is dead.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.612
Time of death, 15:20.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.520
[machine beeps]

33:12.191 --> 33:14.093
[machine beeps]

33:15.127 --> 33:17.329
Connor.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.365
[machine beeps]

33:22.434 --> 33:24.436
[machine beeps]

33:27.439 --> 33:29.441
[machine beeps]

33:36.348 --> 33:38.350
- Daddy.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.154
Look.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.327
It's your granddaughter.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.116
- [exhaling slowly]

34:12.784 --> 34:16.355
- Daddy?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.389
Oh, no.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.232
[crying]

34:27.299 --> 34:29.668
- I've never seen anything
like that.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.704
- Oh, no.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.545
- Baruch dayan emet.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.580
- [muffled crying]

35:06.705 --> 35:08.807
- Dr. Reese,
how's our patient?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.310
- I gave her
ketoconazole cream.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.379
Her fungal infection
should be gone in a week.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.715
- Excellent.
- Mm-hmm.

35:16.748 --> 35:20.686
Dr. Charles, I've decided
I will take that residency

35:20.719 --> 35:22.354
in psychiatry.

35:22.388 --> 35:24.723
I see now that by combining
my clinical knowledge

35:24.756 --> 35:28.427
with psychology,
maybe I really can help people.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.330
- I am so glad
to hear that.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.437
You're not talking about Emmie
though, are you?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.206
- Um...
- Listen,

35:40.239 --> 35:45.377
you very skillfully treated
a superficial skin infection.

35:45.411 --> 35:48.680
Unfortunately, neither of us
have done anything to address

35:48.714 --> 35:50.849
the profound underlying
psychological issues

35:50.882 --> 35:53.252
that she suffers from.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.620
I'm just saying, you know,

35:54.653 --> 35:56.455
our patient
has a long way to go.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.325
- Oh. Yes.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.693
- Anybody ever tell you
the etymology

36:01.727 --> 36:04.563
of the word "psychiatry"?

36:04.596 --> 36:08.534
The medical treatment
of the soul.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.869
Isn't that marvelous?

36:10.902 --> 36:14.773
So, worry not,
Dr. Reese.

36:14.806 --> 36:18.410
We all--all of us
have a long way to go

36:18.444 --> 36:20.446
in healing our souls.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.889
- Dr. Choi.
- Yes?

36:30.922 --> 36:34.393
My patient waited 2 1/2 hours
for a treatment room,

36:34.426 --> 36:37.263
but I understand Treatment 1
has been free all day.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.271
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.607
I'd sure like to know where
Noah Sexton disappeared to.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.689
- 35 grand a year.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.526
- Huh?
- What my malpractice

37:07.559 --> 37:10.396
is going to cost.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.930
And that's on top
of my student loans,

37:11.963 --> 37:13.732
which now
because I'm an attending,

37:13.765 --> 37:16.468
I have to start paying off.

37:16.502 --> 37:20.572
How's your "sick bay" system
working?

37:20.606 --> 37:23.509
- [chuckles]

37:23.542 --> 37:26.678
I will take those
scheduling sheets after all.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.947
- You can have 'em.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.849
Well, you know, the thing
I learned early on,

37:30.882 --> 37:34.586
the nurses,
they run everything anyway.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.390
- Yeah.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.462
- You know,

37:43.495 --> 37:46.532
I saw a dead man
come back to life today.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.902
Makes all this other stuff
seem kinda small.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.718
- Do you think she's on
pre-exposure prophylaxis?

38:06.752 --> 38:10.922
- Pretty standard with HIV.
Why?

38:10.956 --> 38:14.760
- Doesn't look like he's afraid
he'll infect her.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.597
- Well, there's very
little risk, April.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.932
Learn to deal
with things, April.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.968
Life's not perfect.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.776
But it is pretty great.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.821
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, sweetie.

38:42.854 --> 38:43.722
- Let me check your phone.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.891
I want to see
how many "likes" we got.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.927
- "Likes"?
- The selfie we took.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.498
22.
Hey, you know what we should do?

38:52.531 --> 38:53.565
- What?

38:53.599 --> 38:55.634
- We should take one in front
of Dylan's Candy Bar.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.836
That'll make
everybody jealous.

38:57.869 --> 39:00.038
- Yeah, you know
what we should do?

39:00.071 --> 39:04.009
We should go live in a cave
with no electricity

39:04.042 --> 39:06.712
until you're about 35 years old.
That's what we should do.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.647
- Daddy.
- What?

39:12.017 --> 39:14.019
- April.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.589
- Hey.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.625
[thunder rumbling]

39:23.562 --> 39:27.666
- So--so how are we feeling
after work?

39:27.699 --> 39:29.701
- Good.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.737
- Then dinner tonight?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.740
You --you like my raviolis,
right?

39:34.773 --> 39:36.575
- I tolerate your ravioli.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.610
- [chuckles]

39:41.680 --> 39:45.016
- Are you sure you're okay
with everything?

39:45.050 --> 39:46.652
Me, the whole package?

39:46.685 --> 39:49.488
- Baby, I'm sure.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.902
- I'll make the garlic bread.
- [chuckles]

40:05.837 --> 40:09.941
Come on.
[both laughing]

40:12.511 --> 40:13.979
- Oh.
[chuckles]

40:14.012 --> 40:18.717
Mm.
I got these.

40:18.750 --> 40:19.985
- Thanks.
- [sighs]

40:20.018 --> 40:24.756
- I'll get 'em next time.
- Okay.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.592
- You know, I didn't expect
to see you here.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.661
- My mother-in-law insisted
on taking Owen for the night.

40:29.695 --> 40:32.731
She says I need a life.
[laughing]

40:37.168 --> 40:39.605
[both laughing]

40:39.638 --> 40:42.608
- Ah.
- Ahem.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.114
My car is, um,
is over there.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.883
- Okay, I'll walk you to it.
- No, no.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.019
You don't have to do that.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.887
- Okay.

40:55.921 --> 40:59.024
My apartment is just
around the block anyway, so...

41:02.060 --> 41:03.562
- Okay.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.598
Well...
good night.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.070
- You want to come by
for a night cap?

41:17.943 --> 41:19.711
- Yeah.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.747
Yeah, I do.
