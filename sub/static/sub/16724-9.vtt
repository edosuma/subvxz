00:19.556 --> 00:21.890
Mom and Dad might
not recognize us

00:21.891 --> 00:23.125
when we get back
from go-karting.

00:23.126 --> 00:24.393
'Cause our hair
will be like this.

00:24.394 --> 00:26.228
And our faces
will be like this!

00:26.229 --> 00:28.230
And our penises
will be like this.

00:28.231 --> 00:30.766
You can't see what I'm doing,
but it's pretty great.

00:30.767 --> 00:32.634
Three youth tickets, please.

00:32.636 --> 00:35.070
Sorry, track's closed for the
rest of the day. League racing.

00:35.071 --> 00:36.472
What?! What?
But I pedaled all this way

00:36.473 --> 00:37.906
to put the pedal
to the metal.

00:37.941 --> 00:39.241
You'll have to come back
another time.

00:39.242 --> 00:40.843
Perhaps check
the online calendar

00:40.844 --> 00:43.912
that I work so hard on
that no one bothers to look at.

00:43.947 --> 00:46.148
If I'm online, I'm
looking at sloths.

00:46.149 --> 00:48.484
Whoa, Mama like.

00:48.518 --> 00:50.252
TINA: They're fast,
and I'm curious.

00:50.287 --> 00:52.621
Screw regular go-karting.
I want to do that.

00:52.622 --> 00:55.624
Every kid wants to be in
league racing. Get in line.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.459
Okay, where's the line?
(chuckles) Funny, honey.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.461
The only way to join
the circuit is to get a kart.

00:59.462 --> 01:01.430
No problem.
Where do we get one?

01:01.431 --> 01:03.766
They're custom.
They cost a grand, at least.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.301
(groaning):
Ah!

01:05.334 --> 01:07.169
I know you from
somewhere. You're Bryce

01:07.170 --> 01:09.171
from Kingshead Island,
aren't you? Yep.

01:09.172 --> 01:11.006
Oh, yeah. Remember us? Nope.

01:11.007 --> 01:13.275
Ouch. Too bad you won't
be joining the league.

01:13.310 --> 01:15.945
It would've been fun chucking
raisins at you as I blow by.

01:15.946 --> 01:17.346
Geesh-geesh, goosh-goosh.
TINA: Ow.

01:17.380 --> 01:20.015
Ow. Oh, my God, I hate him.
(laughs)

01:20.016 --> 01:21.550
Hard to hate a guy who
gives you raisins.

01:21.551 --> 01:23.185
(chewing loudly)

01:23.219 --> 01:26.155
Three burgers of the day.
Who are your pals, Teddy?

01:26.156 --> 01:28.223
These guys are
from the home brew supply shop.

01:28.224 --> 01:31.026
I brought 'em over here to try
your burgers with Teddy's Brewski.

01:31.027 --> 01:32.795
What's Teddy's Brewski?

01:32.796 --> 01:34.964
It's the name of my home-brewed
beer. I used to call it

01:34.965 --> 01:37.666
Bucket Brew, since that's where
it ferments. In a bucket.

01:37.701 --> 01:39.802
Is it safe to drink? You know,
it's just that you brewed it

01:39.803 --> 01:42.471
in a bucket. Of course it's safe.
It's alcohol.

01:42.472 --> 01:44.006
Mmm... Mmm... Right?

01:44.007 --> 01:45.641
Mm-hmm. Oh.
Mmm.

01:45.675 --> 01:47.309
Aw, so cute.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.645
Your burgers and his beer
are making little belly babies.

01:49.646 --> 01:51.447
Ew. What?
Oh, Bob.

01:51.481 --> 01:53.015
Bob! Bob!
What what? What?

01:53.016 --> 01:55.384
You should sell my beer!
We could be partners! What?

01:55.418 --> 01:57.186
Teddy, I-I don't think
restaurants are allowed

01:57.187 --> 01:59.722
to sell home-brewed beer.
Aw, who's gonna care?

01:59.756 --> 02:02.825
The health inspector, the Bureau
of Alcohol, the police...

02:02.826 --> 02:05.327
So we won't get caught.
We'll run it like a speakeasy.

02:05.328 --> 02:06.862
I'll be like Al
Capone with breasts.

02:06.863 --> 02:09.365
Come on, Bob, just taste
your burger and then my beer.

02:09.399 --> 02:11.367
Well, it's pretty hard
to pair my burgers

02:11.368 --> 02:13.102
with the right beer.

02:13.103 --> 02:14.503
Oh, my God.

02:14.504 --> 02:16.105
Right? Huh? Oh, my God.

02:16.106 --> 02:18.273
That's amazing.
Let's do it! It's amazing!

02:18.274 --> 02:21.410
Let's do it!
(chuckles) Yes! (shouts)

02:21.411 --> 02:23.045
Maybe Mom and Dad
would sponsor a go-kart

02:23.046 --> 02:24.847
if it was advertising
for the restaurant.

02:24.848 --> 02:26.849
(sighs) They can't even sponsor
their electric bill.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.418
Or maybe a sponsorship
would work.

02:29.452 --> 02:31.553
Hey, Mr. Fischoeder!
I missed you. Damn.

02:31.554 --> 02:33.889
Where have you been?
Oh, around.

02:33.923 --> 02:35.524
How would you like
to have semi-exclusive

02:35.525 --> 02:38.193
advertising rights
on a go-kart that you pay for?

02:38.194 --> 02:40.362
Me pay kids? That sounds weird.

02:40.363 --> 02:42.913
How 'bout you pay me...
that sounds better...

02:42.932 --> 02:43.966
No. Um... Huh.

02:43.967 --> 02:45.467
Hold on. I haven't finished.

02:45.468 --> 02:46.802
For one of these!

02:46.803 --> 02:48.570
A broken-down bumper car?

02:48.571 --> 02:50.973
Perhaps you kids can turn
one of these not go-karts

02:50.974 --> 02:53.742
into a very much go-kart.
Someone's sleeping

02:53.743 --> 02:55.978
back here, Mr. Fish.
(snoring)

02:55.979 --> 02:58.881
That's our employee lounge.
Owen, wake up!

02:58.915 --> 03:00.749
Hmm. You look like you've got
something to prove.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.451
Guys, I think this is the one.

03:02.485 --> 03:04.286
Ooh, that's the
most expensive one.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.621
We'll give you
three bucks for it.

03:05.655 --> 03:07.156
Deal. Unless you want to
make it eight dollars

03:07.157 --> 03:09.224
for a second bumper
car, plus Owen,

03:09.225 --> 03:11.060
whom I will throw
in for free.

03:11.094 --> 03:12.995
What can he do?
Lord knows.

03:12.996 --> 03:15.898
It all remains to be seen.
He's a mass of potential.

03:15.899 --> 03:18.100
Now all we need
is a lawn mower engine.

03:18.134 --> 03:19.601
Or a steam engine.

03:19.602 --> 03:21.737
Or a motorcycle engine.

03:21.771 --> 03:23.505
So how much is it
gonna cost us, Critter?

03:23.506 --> 03:25.641
Aw, come on,
I can't charge you guys.

03:25.675 --> 03:27.676
Our kid was born
inside your restaurant.

03:27.677 --> 03:30.479
Plus, I think the parts will be
donated, if you catch my drift.

03:30.513 --> 03:32.247
Come on, people,
let's tear this old dog apart,

03:32.248 --> 03:33.482
teach it new tricks!

03:33.483 --> 03:35.951
♪ ♪

03:41.358 --> 03:43.926
Half bumper car,
half go-kart, all balls.

03:43.927 --> 03:45.527
Nice.

03:45.528 --> 03:47.730
You're gonna bump those
rich kids right off the track.

03:47.764 --> 03:49.498
And how are we
on snack storage?

03:49.532 --> 03:52.201
Chip clip right there on the side.
Chip clip! Yeah.

03:52.202 --> 03:54.203
Now, she's gonna handle
like a bumper car.

03:54.204 --> 03:56.538
The steering's real loose,
so don't be afraid

03:56.539 --> 03:58.140
to whip that wheel around
real good.

03:58.141 --> 04:00.309
Yeah, yeah. You push the
pedal and the thing goes.

04:00.310 --> 04:02.378
Wait till Bryce gets a
load of this sweet ride.

04:02.379 --> 04:03.812
What is that?

04:03.813 --> 04:05.514
Are you jealous?
(laughs)

04:05.548 --> 04:07.049
It doesn't sound like you are,

04:07.050 --> 04:08.951
but you will be
once we race against you.

04:08.952 --> 04:10.452
You're not gonna race
against me.

04:10.453 --> 04:11.520
What are
you talking about?

04:11.554 --> 04:12.688
I'm in A-league.

04:12.689 --> 04:14.123
New cars start
out in B-league.

04:14.124 --> 04:15.958
You got to win your
way up to A-league.

04:15.959 --> 04:18.827
Are you kidding me? Nope.
I'm serious-ing you.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.661
I'll be winning
the Kingshead Island Grand Prix

04:20.663 --> 04:22.664
when you're still figuring out
which pedal is the gas

04:22.665 --> 04:24.500
and which is the brake.
And the big round thing

04:24.501 --> 04:26.702
in the middle that steers it?
That's your mom. Burn.

04:26.736 --> 04:28.670
Oh, that fart with a mouth?
That's your face!

04:28.671 --> 04:30.239
(chuckles)
Yeah, right.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.875
ANNOUNCER: Drivers, ten minutes
till the B-league race.

04:32.876 --> 04:35.310
I guess that's us.
Let's go tear up the B-league

04:35.311 --> 04:37.579
so we can blow it
out Bryce's tailpipe.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.048
(sighs)
Here we go.

04:39.082 --> 04:40.582
ALL:
Wish me luck out there.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.518
Hmm? Wait,
what do you mean wish you luck?

04:42.519 --> 04:44.420
'Cause I'm driving.
I thought I was driving.

04:44.421 --> 04:46.188
I thought we all thought
I was driving.

04:46.189 --> 04:47.756
Oh, my God. Did we not talk

04:47.757 --> 04:49.725
about who's gonna drive?
It's obviously me.

04:49.759 --> 04:52.661
But remember how good I was
at that motorcycle arcade game?

04:52.662 --> 04:55.998
(beeping, engine revs)

04:55.999 --> 04:57.599
The point is to not
burst into flames.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.368
Strongly disagree.

04:59.369 --> 05:01.370
Tina, you're not much better.
Remember what happened

05:01.371 --> 05:03.505
when you drove the car
in the parking lot?

05:03.506 --> 05:05.107
That was different.
That was dirty driving.

05:05.108 --> 05:07.576
This is legal. Go-karting
is good clean fun.

05:07.610 --> 05:09.411
There's only one way
to settle this.

05:09.446 --> 05:11.113
Gene's hairy mole?
Gene's hairy mole.

05:11.114 --> 05:13.849
Oh, boy. Ow. Ow. Ow!

05:13.850 --> 05:15.084
Hold 'em up.

05:15.085 --> 05:17.252
Yes! Uh, I mean...
(groans)

05:17.253 --> 05:19.688
Whatever. I'm the driver. But,
hey, it's all about the team.

05:19.689 --> 05:21.356
Right, sibs?
Fair is fair, I guess.

05:21.357 --> 05:22.691
Go team.

05:22.692 --> 05:24.526
Yeah, Tina!
That's the spirit!

05:24.527 --> 05:27.196
And you know what, I want you
to be my water girl out there.

05:27.197 --> 05:28.564
How does that sound?

05:28.565 --> 05:30.399
Water girl instead
of race kart driver?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.486
(gritting teeth):
Hmm, let me think about that.

05:34.705 --> 05:36.940
Hey, when I win this race,
it'll be like we all won.

05:36.941 --> 05:39.009
Especially me.
T, give me a squirt.

05:39.010 --> 05:41.011
You missed.
Did you do that on purpose?

05:41.012 --> 05:43.213
No. What a crazy
water bottle. Oh, whoops.

05:43.214 --> 05:45.282
Uh, it's doing it again.
Oh, sorry. (grunting) Hey!

05:45.283 --> 05:46.716
This is...
this is crazy. (groans)

05:46.717 --> 05:48.518
ANNOUNCER:
Drivers, start your engines.

05:48.519 --> 05:51.855
That guy can make a flag
do anything he wants.

05:51.856 --> 05:53.423
But mostly flap around.

05:54.559 --> 05:55.559
(groans)

05:55.560 --> 05:57.561
Come on, you hunk of junk!

05:57.562 --> 05:59.596
Go straight! Now turn! Turn!

05:59.630 --> 06:02.566
You call that turning?
The other way!

06:04.302 --> 06:05.735
Pretty good, kid.

06:05.736 --> 06:08.071
But can you Gus?

06:08.072 --> 06:10.607
Whoa. It's beautiful!

06:10.641 --> 06:12.709
Why is it called Gus?
It's named after me.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.377
My name is Gus.

06:14.378 --> 06:16.580
A lot of people think
the Gus comes from the wrists.

06:16.614 --> 06:19.082
It doesn't.
It comes from in here.

06:19.116 --> 06:20.116
Your flask?

06:20.151 --> 06:21.718
Yes. And the heart.

06:21.719 --> 06:23.553
Without heart,
you're just waving a flag around

06:23.554 --> 06:25.388
at the end of a little stick.

06:25.423 --> 06:26.923
Hey, maybe you've got
what it takes

06:26.924 --> 06:28.892
to be a junior-Gus-in-training.

06:28.893 --> 06:32.062
I've waited my entire life
to hear those exact words!

06:32.063 --> 06:34.731
That bumper-kart is terrible.

06:34.732 --> 06:36.333
We'll never win a race
in that thing.

06:36.334 --> 06:37.734
Well, we might
if, you know,

06:37.735 --> 06:39.903
you drove it like
Critter told us to.

06:39.904 --> 06:41.271
What's that supposed
to mean?

06:41.272 --> 06:42.973
Maybe it's not
the kart's fault

06:42.974 --> 06:45.141
you slammed into all those
walls and got turned around

06:45.142 --> 06:47.744
and drove the wrong way for an
embarrassing amount of time.

06:47.745 --> 06:49.779
You think you can drive that
thing? (scoffs) Be my guest.

06:49.814 --> 06:51.815
Take a lap.

06:51.816 --> 06:53.750
We're gonna go nice and easy.

06:53.751 --> 06:55.986
You lead, I'll follow.
I know you want to bump

06:56.020 --> 06:58.622
into stuff but you can't.
You're a race car now.

06:58.623 --> 07:00.957
You're all grown-up.
That's it, Mr. Speedy.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.092
(tires screech)

07:04.595 --> 07:05.967
See?
See what?

07:05.997 --> 07:07.430
How I took that turn
instead of crashing

07:07.431 --> 07:08.832
like you did?
Maybe I should be the one

07:08.833 --> 07:10.467
behind the wheel
for Team Belcher?

07:10.501 --> 07:13.603
Tina, hello, it was
my first race, okay? Back off.

07:13.604 --> 07:15.438
Besides, I won Gene's hairy
mole fair and square.

07:15.439 --> 07:17.174
So let's speak
of this no more.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.942
It's just, I could maybe win...
Gene's hairy mole!

07:18.943 --> 07:20.277
I know. Gene's hairy mole.

07:20.278 --> 07:22.679
How's it coming? TEDDY: Great.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.315
Once I'm done here, I'm gonna bring
up another batch from the basement.

07:25.349 --> 07:27.184
Home brew in used bottles;
I think we're getting good

07:27.185 --> 07:28.685
at this speakeasy thing.

07:28.686 --> 07:30.220
And all these sipsies
are getting me tipsy.

07:30.221 --> 07:32.355
Eh, I had to hammer some
of the caps back on

07:32.356 --> 07:34.624
and I used tape
for a couple of 'em, but...

07:34.659 --> 07:35.792
I don't think
anyone will notice.

07:35.793 --> 07:37.794
Uh, another "beer,"
please? Wink.

07:37.795 --> 07:40.530
Another one of the beers
we normally sell here?

07:40.531 --> 07:42.032
Sure. Here you go.

07:42.033 --> 07:43.834
Whoa! Live one!

07:43.835 --> 07:46.036
Is he supposed to say "wink"?
Or is he just supposed to wink?

07:46.037 --> 07:47.637
Well, we've been
doing both. Oh...

07:47.638 --> 07:50.006
Oh, God. Oh, God! Bobby,
the G-men are here!

07:50.007 --> 07:51.842
Turn the whole room around
like they do in the movies!

07:51.843 --> 07:54.077
Quick, go! Ugh, no, no. Not now.

07:54.078 --> 07:55.846
Teddy, get out of here!
Hurry. Hurry.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.081
Hugo!
Bob.

07:58.082 --> 07:59.850
Ron. Bob. Ron!

07:59.851 --> 08:02.052
Oh. What's wrong with
this picture, Ron?

08:02.053 --> 08:03.320
Uh...

08:03.321 --> 08:05.355
There are actually customers
in here!

08:05.389 --> 08:06.256
Right.

08:06.257 --> 08:08.091
(sniffing)
Smells...

08:08.092 --> 08:10.360
yeasty.
(sniffing)

08:10.361 --> 08:11.828
I've never smelled this tangy...

08:11.829 --> 08:14.564
(sniffing)
sour...

08:14.599 --> 08:16.700
yeast here before.

08:16.701 --> 08:20.036
Oh, uh, well, we have
started baking bread,

08:20.037 --> 08:22.372
so maybe you're smelling
the yeast from that. Yeah.

08:22.406 --> 08:26.009
And where is this yeasty bread, Bob?
Uh, we, uh...

08:26.010 --> 08:28.445
we threw it away.
It wasn't any good. No. Yeah.

08:28.446 --> 08:29.846
Terrible, terrible.
It didn't come out, so...

08:29.847 --> 08:31.414
I mean, it was
our first batch.

08:31.415 --> 08:33.717
You know? W-We're not...
Who are we? You know?

08:33.751 --> 08:35.085
We're not bread experts.
(chuckles)

08:35.119 --> 08:36.186
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

08:36.220 --> 08:37.087
(chuckles)

08:37.087 --> 08:39.089
(chuckling)

08:39.090 --> 08:41.357
(sighs)
Bread.

08:41.359 --> 08:43.760
BOB (loudly): Hugo, you really
don't have to go down there!

08:43.760 --> 08:45.595
HUGO:
So yeasty.

08:45.596 --> 08:47.264
Okay, you need to stop
saying that word.

08:47.265 --> 08:48.532
It's making me
uncomfortable.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.534
Oh, really?
Yeasty, yeasty, yeasty.

08:50.535 --> 08:53.103
You know what I think, Bob?
I think the bread story

08:53.104 --> 08:55.272
is a cover for what
you're really doing.

08:55.306 --> 08:56.440
And what would that be?

08:56.441 --> 08:58.041
You're brewing your own beer!

08:58.042 --> 09:00.243
What?! That's crazy.
What? (chuckles)

09:00.244 --> 09:02.579
It's crazy. Where would you get that?
Beer. Who's brewing beer?

09:02.613 --> 09:04.748
What are... What is... what is this?
What? Who is this guy? Beer. Pfft.

09:04.749 --> 09:07.484
You know, the only thing worse
than an idiot who makes

09:07.485 --> 09:11.455
bacteria-infested home brew
is a restaurant that serves it.

09:11.456 --> 09:13.490
Well, Hugo, there's
no home brew here,

09:13.491 --> 09:15.096
so are we done
with the inspection?

09:15.126 --> 09:17.127
(sniffs)
I suppose.

09:17.128 --> 09:18.628
But know this, Bob,

09:18.663 --> 09:21.331
if I find out
you are selling bacteria beer,

09:21.332 --> 09:23.333
you're going to get
the triple smack-down.

09:23.334 --> 09:25.602
Smack one: I shut you down.

09:25.603 --> 09:28.238
Smack two:
beer and wine license? Gone.

09:28.239 --> 09:29.573
Smack three?

09:29.574 --> 09:31.475
Tell 'em, Ron.
Uh...

09:31.509 --> 09:33.143
You rot in hell, Bob!

09:33.144 --> 09:34.744
Hmm.
Let's go, Ron.

09:34.745 --> 09:38.315
And I'll be back
to try that bread, Bob.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.984
Great. 'Cause it's gonna
be here, Hugo.

09:40.985 --> 09:42.986
HUGO: Oh, great!
I'll bring my bread mouth!

09:43.020 --> 09:46.656
So I guess this means
the speakeasy's over?

09:46.691 --> 09:49.025
Nothing's over, Teddy.
Hugo can't stop us.

09:49.026 --> 09:51.328
All right, who knows
how to bake bread?

09:51.362 --> 09:53.597
(engines rumbling)

09:55.133 --> 09:57.033
Flutter, flutter, flutter.
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

09:57.034 --> 09:58.268
And snap it off!

09:58.302 --> 10:00.103
Hell of a snap-off, Gene.

10:00.104 --> 10:01.805
Yeah, but my shimmy was shabby.

10:03.174 --> 10:05.976
I saw you drive that monstrosity
the other day.

10:05.977 --> 10:08.145
It was impressive. Want to take
a little walk and talk?

10:08.146 --> 10:10.180
I have a proposition for you.
I'm taken.

10:10.181 --> 10:11.615
Well, it's complicated.

10:11.616 --> 10:13.483
Honey, if I was hitting
on you, you'd know,

10:13.484 --> 10:14.718
because you'd be terrified.

10:14.719 --> 10:16.153
Trust me, you're
hitting on me.

10:16.154 --> 10:17.687
Just come with us,
please.

10:17.722 --> 10:19.556
My name is Sasha, and
this is my racing team.

10:19.557 --> 10:20.824
Hi.
Hi.

10:20.825 --> 10:22.559
So how'd you like
to be a driver?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.561
Oh, I can't. My sister
is our team's driver.

10:24.562 --> 10:26.563
She won the right to
drive fair and square.

10:26.564 --> 10:28.298
Gene's hairy mole. It's
this thing we do with...

10:28.299 --> 10:30.000
Oh, it's okay.
I don't need to know.

10:30.001 --> 10:32.669
Listen, I'm not talking
about you driving that thing.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.971
I'm talking about this.
TINA: Whoa.

10:34.972 --> 10:37.374
Eddy, our usual driver,
is in detention again.

10:37.375 --> 10:41.011
You'd be doing us a big favor if
you drove the K.I.S. kart today.

10:41.012 --> 10:42.512
"Kiss"?
No, K.I.S.

10:42.513 --> 10:44.414
It stands for Kingshead
Island Speeders.

10:44.415 --> 10:46.383
Can I call it "kiss"?
No. Listen to me.

10:46.417 --> 10:49.486
This is your chance to drive a
real race kart, in the A-league.

10:49.487 --> 10:51.221
But I thought you had to win
your way into the A-league.

10:51.255 --> 10:52.522
It's about the kart.

10:52.523 --> 10:54.224
This kart is already
in the A-league.

10:54.225 --> 10:56.193
But why don't you want to
drive the car yourself?

10:56.194 --> 10:57.894
Any kid can drive.
I want to win.

10:57.929 --> 10:59.730
You think I can win?
In A-league?

10:59.764 --> 11:02.265
If you can get that bumper-fart
around the track in 70 seconds,

11:02.266 --> 11:04.201
imagine how fast
you can go in this.

11:04.202 --> 11:06.103
(engine purring)
Wow.

11:06.104 --> 11:08.538
You and this thing might
actually have what it takes

11:08.539 --> 11:10.240
to knock Bryce off the top spot.

11:10.241 --> 11:12.209
He deserves to be beaten,
by the way.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.711
He's a dirty driver.
We call him Not Nice Bryce.

11:14.712 --> 11:17.948
I don't know. The bumper-kart
is kind of a family project.

11:17.949 --> 11:19.416
Oh, sure, of course, yeah.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.917
You can just keep
squirting water

11:20.918 --> 11:22.586
into your sister's mouth
if you want.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.921
(grunting) Here,
I made you this last-place medal.

11:24.922 --> 11:26.356
It's gum.

11:26.357 --> 11:27.758
Good one, Bryce.

11:27.759 --> 11:29.860
Joke's on you. I <i> love</i> old gum!

11:29.861 --> 11:31.728
Mmm. (gags)

11:31.763 --> 11:34.731
It's okay. He walked away.

11:34.732 --> 11:35.932
Tina, what are you wearing?

11:35.933 --> 11:37.067
A driver's jumpsuit.

11:37.068 --> 11:38.635
We've been through this, okay?

11:38.636 --> 11:41.371
Belcher Racing only has
one driver, and that's me.

11:41.372 --> 11:44.374
I know. I'm driving for the
Kingshead Island Speeders.

11:44.409 --> 11:45.876
What?!
I call it "kiss."

11:49.041 --> 11:50.408
How can you do that to us?!

11:50.409 --> 11:51.843
You're like
a Belcherdict-Arnold!

11:51.844 --> 11:53.546
I was Team Belcher's
best driver,

11:53.579 --> 11:54.913
but you didn't care if we won

11:54.914 --> 11:56.214
as long as you got
to be the driver.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.982
That's crazy. You're crazy.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.984
Get out of that jumpsuit,
get your water bottle

11:59.985 --> 12:01.319
and get back in the pit.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.987
I'm never going back to the pit

12:02.988 --> 12:05.089
unless the pit is a cool diner
where teens hang out.

12:05.090 --> 12:07.392
Look, the A-league race
is about to start. I got to go.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.493
You're in A-league?!

12:08.494 --> 12:10.028
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.896
They give your go-kart a
little wreath if you win.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.865
Oh, wow!
Isn't that great?

12:13.866 --> 12:15.667
It <i> is</i> pretty
great. Bye!

12:18.504 --> 12:20.271
SASHA: Hi, Tina.
How are you doing? Good.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.407
'Cause you're looking
a little stiff out there, kiddo.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.908
Who's saying this?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.443
Sasha. I'm on the radio
inside your helmet.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.178
Oh, 'cause I thought
for a second you were...

12:27.179 --> 12:29.547
Oh, never mind. I'm not gonna
tell you what I thought.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.748
Tina, you're driving
like a water girl.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.050
Come on, cut it loose.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.618
All right, all right,
I just need

12:33.619 --> 12:35.486
to get to know the car
a little, I guess. Hello.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.088
You feel different
than the bumper-kart.

12:37.122 --> 12:38.723
But I must feel different
than your old driver,

12:38.724 --> 12:40.658
'cause I have a girl butt,
or so I'm told.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.759
I'm Tina, by the way.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.760
Tina, I'm gonna put you on mute.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.362
Okay.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.397
(engine revving)
Whoa.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.199
You did that really well.
Nice turning, wheels.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.434
And good job,
steering wheel, too.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.036
And, uh, engine,
you did your part.

12:52.037 --> 12:53.605
Second place!
I knew it!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.273
I knew you
were a racer!

12:55.274 --> 12:57.408
I got a little worried when
you were talking to yourself

12:57.409 --> 12:59.143
and being really weird,
but then you came through!

12:59.144 --> 13:00.745
It's okay!
(laughs)

13:00.746 --> 13:02.780
This time second,
next time beat Bryce.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.116
LOUISE:
<i>Tina, can you pass me a napkin?</i>

13:05.150 --> 13:06.918
And try not to betray it.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.519
Louise, please
pass the pepper.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.421
And try not to crash it
into the salt.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.824
Why don't you try to remember
where that pepper came from?

13:12.825 --> 13:15.560
From here, from this
apartment, from this family.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.795
So that's where
pepper comes from.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.398
Girls, you two need
to stop all this.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.133
You're both
go-kart drivers now.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.302
And you're not even racing
against each other, right?

13:24.336 --> 13:25.603
That's right.
I'm in the A-league.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.238
Well, I'm coming
for you, T.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.107
If I finish the season in
first place in the B-league,

13:29.108 --> 13:30.742
then I get a spot in the
Kingshead Island Grand Prix.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.143
You do?
Yup.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.445
And that's when I get
to beat you.

13:34.446 --> 13:37.282
But you have to actually win
races to finish in first place.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.783
Maybe you didn't
totally understand that.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.319
(chuckles):
Oh, keep it up.

13:41.353 --> 13:43.121
Way ahead of you. Literally.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.489
(growls)

13:44.490 --> 13:47.192
Look, I know there's this rumor

13:47.193 --> 13:49.694
that Tina's a better driver,
and I think you started it,

13:49.695 --> 13:51.763
but you and me are gonna work
real hard,

13:51.797 --> 13:54.098
and we're gonna win some races.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.434
♪ ♪

14:19.625 --> 14:20.959
(Louise whoops loudly)

14:20.993 --> 14:23.361
Ha, ha!

14:23.362 --> 14:25.763
Looks like I'll be seeing you
at the Grand Prix, sis.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.899
And I'll be seeing you
from the first place podium.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.201
Also, I'll see you at home,
and also in the car,

14:30.202 --> 14:31.870
'cause we should probably
carpool to the race.

14:31.904 --> 14:32.871
Yup, yup, got it!

14:32.905 --> 14:35.073
I hit the gas,
and I drive away!

14:37.877 --> 14:41.713
It's weird how you freshly baked
the staleness right into them.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.382
It's-it's an old family secret.
Another cold one, Bob.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.218
Hey, Bob, that bun
doesn't look like this bun, Bob.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.088
You trying to screw me?
I want the fresh-baked buns.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.689
I want
the fresh-baked buns.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.692
So, you're not using these buns
on your burgers?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.995
Suspicious. Gretchen? Move on.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.831
We're-we're making buns
for, uh, um, uh...

14:59.865 --> 15:01.599
For what?
Uh, the buns are for...

15:01.600 --> 15:03.501
For breakfast!
Yes.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.737
We're gonna start
breakfast now. Hmm.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.238
Breakfast at Bob's.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.040
I can't wait
to come by and try it.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.408
6:00 a.m. sound good?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.043
I mean, well, we
haven't really talked

15:12.044 --> 15:13.411
about when we're
opening yet, so...

15:13.445 --> 15:16.047
Okay, see you
at 6:00 then.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.882
And you better
have sausages, Bob!

15:17.883 --> 15:18.750
We'll have it!

15:23.789 --> 15:26.424
BOB: So, this is what
the kids have been up to?

15:26.458 --> 15:29.093
I had no idea it was, like,
you know, actual racing.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.762
It is a beautiful day
for racing.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.763
Hey, want a hit?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.198
Sure. Thanks, Crit.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.200
Mmm, this homebrew of yours
is oh so refreshing.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.435
Your bread is, uh...
Whoop, hey, there it goes!

15:37.436 --> 15:39.404
Got away from me there.
Sorry about that.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.105
Uh, you-you kind of threw it.
Oh, yeah.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.941
Right. So it didn't
get away from you.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.375
You threw it.
No, it's bad.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.044
I was trying
to spare your feelings,

15:46.045 --> 15:47.579
but if you want to address it,
it's not very good bread.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.280
No, I get it. No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.649
I guess I got it right away.
I just thought... forget it.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.618
Yeah. Unnecessary
little confrontation here.

15:53.652 --> 15:56.154
Gene, you've been
oddly enthusiastic

15:56.155 --> 15:58.356
about flag waving
these last couple weeks.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.025
I thought you were just messing
with me, but you were serious.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.160
Very serious.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.261
Then, well, there's something

16:03.262 --> 16:04.596
I want to ask you.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.930
Oh, my God, you're dying!

16:05.931 --> 16:07.332
I'll take over for you!

16:07.333 --> 16:09.300
What? No, I'm not dying.
For now.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.435
I'm not dying.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.570
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.105
I was gonna ask you

16:14.106 --> 16:16.107
if you wanted
to flap your first grand prix.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.142
(gasps)
I would be honored!

16:18.143 --> 16:20.345
I'll wave your flag, Gus,
but I'll never replace you.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.980
Right, I-I know.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.615
Just to clarify,
it's only one race.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.716
We'll see.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.518
Guys, huddle up.
Cookie toast.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.152
Tina, bring it home for us.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.355
Uh, hey, Rico, these cookies
are ten dollars each.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.490
You're eating them like they're
five dollars each. Sorry.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.425
Can I have a cookie?
I'll put a cookie on the finish line.

16:34.426 --> 16:35.927
But what if someone
drives over it?

16:35.928 --> 16:38.129
That someone will be you.
Then I can't eat it.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.965
Ugh. Great. Bryce.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.367
You here,
me no like.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.768
Pasta salad
on your kart.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.169
Ugh!
(laughs)

16:45.170 --> 16:47.839
Don't you put
pasta salad on my kart!

16:47.840 --> 16:50.642
ANNOUNCER: Drivers, two minutes
to the start of the Grand Prix!

16:50.643 --> 16:53.344
I'm gonna beat you!
I'm gonna beat Tina!

16:53.345 --> 16:55.280
I'm gonna beat all
you Richie Riches!

16:55.281 --> 16:57.048
Not likely,
especially because of that.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.450
Aw, crap.
Flick, flick.

17:01.263 --> 17:03.731
It's a blown pump. I don't
have my tools, but maybe

17:03.765 --> 17:05.432
I can rig something. ANNOUNCER:
Drivers, to the starting line!

17:05.433 --> 17:06.934
I don't know if
we're gonna make it!

17:06.935 --> 17:08.277
We'll make it! We'll make it!

17:08.303 --> 17:09.837
What's going on?

17:09.838 --> 17:11.472
It looks like you have
one less competitor to beat.

17:11.506 --> 17:12.940
But I don't want
to beat her this way.

17:12.941 --> 17:14.340
Today, you beat
her this way.

17:14.342 --> 17:15.943
Tomorrow, you beat
her that way.

17:15.944 --> 17:17.912
All that matters is today
you beat her this way.

17:17.945 --> 17:20.548
Drivers, start your engines!
(grunts) There! Now you're gonna

17:20.582 --> 17:22.316
leak some oil, but you
just might make it around!

17:22.349 --> 17:24.919
Thanks, Critter.
Oh, and a wheel mighfall off.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.854
What? What?! Nothing!
Get out of your head!

17:26.855 --> 17:29.323
Did you fix it or not, Critter?!
Let's say I did.

17:29.357 --> 17:30.491
Go, go, go!

17:31.626 --> 17:33.527
(tires screeching)

17:37.866 --> 17:39.366
Come on, bumper-kart!

17:39.367 --> 17:41.102
Hold it together!
You got this!

17:46.842 --> 17:48.209
How you doing
out there?

17:48.210 --> 17:49.643
Well, I'm torn
between the desire to win

17:49.644 --> 17:51.011
and my love for my sister.

17:51.012 --> 17:52.313
Forget it. Bye.
Bye.

17:57.152 --> 18:00.221
Atta girl.
Let's beat these snobs!

18:07.062 --> 18:09.255
Yeah! Uh-huh!

18:14.136 --> 18:16.971
♪ Every day... ♪
(engine revving)

18:17.005 --> 18:18.097
All right!
(whooping)

18:23.245 --> 18:24.879
Gene, it's white
flag time.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.981
Last lap coming up!

18:30.852 --> 18:32.987
It's now or never,
Tina. Make your move!

18:33.021 --> 18:34.355
Pass him!

18:37.893 --> 18:39.693
Aah! Oh, come on!

18:39.728 --> 18:42.038
Hey! That's not nice, Bryce!
Oh, I get it now.

18:45.734 --> 18:47.251
Aah!
That's it!

18:48.336 --> 18:50.571
(tires screeching)
What?!

18:50.605 --> 18:52.406
So long, Bryce.
I kartly knew you.

18:52.441 --> 18:54.909
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go!
Come on, Bryce, get it together.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.245
That's Tina and
Louise out in front.

18:58.246 --> 18:59.747
Come on, girls!
Win this thing!

18:59.748 --> 19:01.682
Oh, my God. I assumed
they'd both lose.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.751
What if one of them wins
and beats the other?

19:03.752 --> 19:05.152
Dibs on not handling it!

19:05.187 --> 19:07.229
Checkered flag time!
They're coming in!

19:07.255 --> 19:08.923
Gene, do the double!

19:08.957 --> 19:10.591
I'm not ready!

19:10.625 --> 19:12.460
Easy, easy.
Deep breath.

19:12.461 --> 19:14.195
Let it flow
from within you.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.596
Here they come!

19:19.267 --> 19:20.901
(tires screeching)

19:20.936 --> 19:21.902
Son of a bitch!

19:23.271 --> 19:25.005
SASHA:
Yes! The Grand Prix is ours!

19:25.040 --> 19:26.073
Go Team K.I.S.

19:29.277 --> 19:30.678
No, go Team Belcher.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.047
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?

19:33.048 --> 19:34.815
(thud)

19:34.816 --> 19:37.134
Are you crazy? You're helping
another team win?!

19:37.152 --> 19:38.919
Sorry, Sasha.
It's a family thing.

19:38.954 --> 19:40.321
(grunting)

19:40.322 --> 19:41.756
He's Gussin'!

19:41.790 --> 19:44.225
What are you doing?!
Helping you win!

19:44.259 --> 19:46.894
You should win!
You're the better driver.

19:46.928 --> 19:49.363
You should win. You worked
really hard to get here.

19:49.398 --> 19:51.632
I guess, but...
Oh, I just won.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.401
Nice flag-waving, Gene!

19:53.435 --> 19:56.237
I did it! I did it!
I waved that flag!

19:56.271 --> 19:58.105
(whoops)
Yay, kids!

19:58.106 --> 19:59.740
Yes! Yes, kids!

19:59.741 --> 20:01.342
(whoops) Yeah,
that's the way to do it!

20:01.343 --> 20:03.611
Belchers! Belchers!
Belchers...

20:03.612 --> 20:05.246
No one? No one.

20:08.483 --> 20:10.251
Are you done
yet, Hugo?

20:10.252 --> 20:12.753
Look, Bob, we both know
you're slinging homebrew.

20:12.788 --> 20:15.022
And if my supervisor wasn't
saying, "I'm going to fire you

20:15.023 --> 20:16.857
if you waste any more time
on that case,"

20:16.858 --> 20:18.659
I'd nail you for it.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.636
That said...
the sausages are good.

20:20.662 --> 20:22.096
Let's go, Ron!

20:22.097 --> 20:23.798
Hey, can I get a box
for my pancake half?

20:23.799 --> 20:26.767
Just stuff it into your mouth!
It's half a bite!

20:26.802 --> 20:28.144
(doorbells jingle) BOB:
We got to stop.

20:28.170 --> 20:29.670
We can't keep this up.

20:29.671 --> 20:31.672
Oh, thank God.
I'm so bloated and tired.

20:31.673 --> 20:33.340
Somebody's gonna
have to tell Teddy.

20:33.341 --> 20:34.942
Dibs on not telling him!
Dibs on not... Damn it!

20:34.943 --> 20:36.193
How do you
talk so fast?

20:36.211 --> 20:38.813
TINA:
Vroom. Oh, good turn.

20:38.814 --> 20:40.948
Vroom.
Tina? Tina?

20:40.949 --> 20:42.983
You're-you're driving
in your sleep again.

20:42.984 --> 20:44.719
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.454
I know it's like we both won,

20:46.455 --> 20:49.323
but maybe we both don't need
to sleep with the trophy, huh?

20:49.324 --> 20:51.325
(sighs)
Okay, one more night.

20:51.326 --> 20:53.227
Okay, one more week.
Sweet dreams.
