00:01.268 --> 00:03.137
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy, The Vampire Slayer.

00:03.170 --> 00:06.339
Did you know your sister
took my key, Dawnie?
And she won't give it back.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.308
I bet you know
where she put it, don't you?

00:08.342 --> 00:11.644
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would protect it
with her life.

00:11.679 --> 00:15.083
So they sent the key to her
in the form of a sister."

00:15.115 --> 00:18.719
Let Glory understand this:
I won't help her find the key.

00:18.751 --> 00:20.487
I would never do that
to an innocent--

00:20.521 --> 00:22.890
-An innocent?
-It's not a person.

00:24.625 --> 00:29.263
-What about the key?
-He indicated
that it was a person.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.536
[gasps]
Oh, god, no.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.070
I love you.

00:37.104 --> 00:40.408
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.409
You are not my boyfriend!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.447
-I kinda got the impression
that she was a--
-Robot.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.716
-Oh, yeah, robot.
-She's a robot.

00:48.749 --> 00:54.021
I made her to love me.
I didn't make a toy.
I made a girlfriend.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.789
-I'm placing an order.
-No, I'm not making
any more girls.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.659
Sure you are.
Here's your specs.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.429
Mom?

01:03.331 --> 01:04.397
What are you doin'?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.534
Mommy?

01:07.567 --> 01:11.272
MAN:
We commend to almighty god
our sister, Joyce Summers.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.310
-But it's tomorrow
that I'm worried about.
-What's tomorrow?

01:16.343 --> 01:18.346
That's exactly
what I don't know.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.484
Giles, you don't have to help.
You cooked.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.387
Oh, come on.
I quite like to cook.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.088
Helping you two out
makes me feel useful.

01:29.123 --> 01:32.225
Wanna clean out
the garage on Saturday?
You could feel indispensable.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.262
Hmm. How tempting.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.229
Dawn, if there are
any plates in your room,
let's have them

01:36.264 --> 01:38.466
before they get furry,
and we have to name them.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.602
Hey, I was, like,
five then.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.007
How is she doing?

01:48.841 --> 01:50.311
And you?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.480
I'm okay.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.115
Well, some minutes
are harder than others.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.118
I'm so sorry.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.888
All I can say is
it will get better.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.125
It has to.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.764
We're holding up, though,
you know,
getting into a routine.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.933
Good.
Routine's good.

02:13.967 --> 02:18.572
In fact, I was thinking
that we might return
to our training schedule.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.977
I don't know.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.479
I was, um,
thinking about

02:26.514 --> 02:30.651
maybe taking a break
or something.

02:32.252 --> 02:36.856
Just ease off for a while,
not get into full slay mode.

02:36.889 --> 02:40.060
You were doing so well.

02:40.093 --> 02:44.198
And-and you were great,
helping me
with everything.

02:44.231 --> 02:48.868
I'm just starting
to feel uneasy about stuff.

02:48.901 --> 02:50.237
Stuff?

02:50.271 --> 02:53.507
Training, slaying.
All of it.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.810
It's just--

02:56.843 --> 03:00.080
I mean, I can beat up
the demons until
the cows come home,

03:00.112 --> 03:03.417
and then I can
beat up the cows.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.752
But I'm not sure I like
what it's doing to me.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.920
But you've mastered so much.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.358
I mean, your strength
and resilience alone--
Yeah.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.426
Strength, resilience.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.795
Those are all words
for hardness.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.901
I'm starting to feel
like being the Slayer

03:20.933 --> 03:23.271
is turning me
into stone.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.373
Turning you into stone?
Buffy--
Just--

03:26.407 --> 03:28.542
Think about it.

03:28.575 --> 03:32.079
I was never there
for Riley, not like
I was for Angel.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.747
I was terrible to Dawn.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.516
-At a time like this--
-No.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.453
You're bound to feel
emotionally numb.

03:39.486 --> 03:42.622
Before that.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.259
Riley left because
I was shut down.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.627
He's gone.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.631
And now my mom is gone.

03:50.663 --> 03:55.201
And I loved her
more than anything,

03:55.235 --> 03:58.972
and... I don't know
if she knew.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.942
Oh, she knew.

04:01.974 --> 04:05.145
-Always.
-I don't know.

04:05.177 --> 04:08.147
To slay, to kill--

04:08.181 --> 04:12.286
it means being hard
on the inside.

04:12.319 --> 04:16.889
Maybe being the perfect Slayer
means being too hard
to love at all.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.225
I already feel like
i can hardly say the words.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.661
-Buffy--
-Giles...

04:22.995 --> 04:24.665
I love you.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.233
Love, love,
love, love, love--

04:27.266 --> 04:29.970
-Giles, it feels strange.
-Well, I shouldn't wonder.

04:31.704 --> 04:33.973
How serious are you
about this?

04:37.377 --> 04:39.480
Ten.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.281
I'm serious to
the amount of ten.

04:44.884 --> 04:47.521
There is something...
in the Watchers' Diaries.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.023
A quest.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.992
A quest?
Like finding a grail
or something?

04:53.026 --> 04:57.497
Not a grail.
Maybe answers.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.000
It would take a day,
perhaps two.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.771
I'm not leaving Dawn,
not with Glory
looking for her.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.971
Sure you can.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.041
What's the deal?

05:09.076 --> 05:13.112
Some Slayers before Buffy
found it helpful
in regaining their focus,

05:13.146 --> 05:14.848
in learning more
about their role.

05:14.882 --> 05:18.285
There's a sacred place
in the desert.
It's not far.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.521
But I can't go.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.555
I'm not leaving you, Dawn.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.293
If you have to go learn--

05:26.326 --> 05:30.262
I mean, if it'll help you out,
I think you should do it.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.768
I can hang with the gang.
I'll be okay.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.677
I love you, Dawn.
You know that, right?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.180
Yeah.
I love you too.

05:47.213 --> 05:51.418
I love you,
 really love you.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.687
Gettin' weird.

05:53.721 --> 05:57.356
Sorry.
But it's important
that I tell you.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.125
Weird love's better
than no love.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.264
Some say it's better
than the real thing.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.401
Better than
the real thing.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.273
SPIKE:
She looks good,
but what about the rest?

06:13.305 --> 06:15.875
A little walk,
a little talk,

06:15.908 --> 06:18.177
perhaps a zippy cartwheel.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.581
Hey, she's, uh, great.

06:20.613 --> 06:23.617
You'll be real happy,
I swear. She's got
everything you asked for--

06:23.651 --> 06:26.754
all the extra programming,
tons of real-world knowledge,

06:26.786 --> 06:28.622
the profiles you gave me
about her family and friends.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.223
All the extra programming,
right?

06:31.257 --> 06:35.127
Uh, the stuff
that you wanted,
the scenario responses--

06:35.161 --> 06:38.632
You know, the, uh--
uh, special skills.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.933
All of it.
Now, you said that
I could leave town--

06:40.968 --> 06:44.737
Wait. I'm not sure
I'm a satisfied customer.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.274
She looks
a little shiny to me,
you know?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.242
A touch of plasticine.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.377
(beep)

06:50.409 --> 06:51.778
Spike?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.480
Oh, Spike!

07:00.987 --> 07:02.322
She'll do.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.161
(theme music playing)

07:58.211 --> 08:00.713
(sighs)
He's getting stronger.

08:00.747 --> 08:04.016
I'm losing him.
I'm losing control of him.

08:04.050 --> 08:08.154
You are speaking of Ben,
most glamorous
yet tasteful one?

08:08.187 --> 08:10.824
He stabbed you in your body.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.660
Jinx is all right,
your highness,

08:12.692 --> 08:16.930
and we do have
the new knowledge that
the key is a human being.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.033
If time runs out on us
and all we're left with is info,

08:21.067 --> 08:23.302
then we're screwed.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.706
-Oh, surely not.
-No. We're screwed.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.242
But you're a God.
The sacred Glorificus.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.379
I'm a God in exile,

08:32.412 --> 08:35.716
far from the hellfires
of home

08:35.749 --> 08:39.186
and sharing my body
with an enemy

08:39.219 --> 08:42.556
-that stabs my boys in
their fleshy little stomachs.
-(groans)

08:42.590 --> 08:45.091
(groans)
I'm in pain.

08:45.125 --> 08:50.429
How can we help?
We'll lay down our lives.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.836
The Slayer and the key
are connected.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.605
She's going to have
contact with it.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.908
Find out who's new
in her life,

09:00.941 --> 09:04.344
Who's... special,
who's different.

09:04.376 --> 09:06.078
Watch her.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.716
We can do that,
O... thou.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.918
I want to hear
about everyone

09:10.951 --> 09:13.854
she has contact with.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.989
That girl has my key,

09:17.289 --> 09:20.559
and I'm trusting you boys
to get it for me.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.461
If you love me,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.832
get it for me.

09:48.587 --> 09:51.423
-What's in the trunk?
-Supplies.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.493
Supplies?
I was wondering
about that.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.828
Like food, water,
maybe a compass?

09:55.863 --> 09:58.899
What about a book, a gourd
and a bunch of twigs?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.668
I don't think
I'll be that hungry.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.335
They're for me.
Come on. This way.

10:02.369 --> 10:07.640
You see, the location
of the sacred place
is a guarded secret.

10:07.674 --> 10:11.144
I can't take you there
myself.

10:11.177 --> 10:16.149
I'll have to perform a ritual
to transfer my guardianship
of you, temporarily,

10:16.182 --> 10:18.418
to a-- to a guide.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.787
This'll do.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.124
A guide,
but no food or water?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.259
So it leads me
to a sacred place,
and then a week later

10:26.293 --> 10:28.595
it leads you
to my bleached bones?
Buffy, please.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.562
It takes more than a week
to bleach bones.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.001
So, how's it start?

10:36.068 --> 10:38.038
I, uh,

10:38.071 --> 10:40.841
jump out of the circle,
then I jump back in it,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.875
and then, um,

10:42.909 --> 10:44.945
I shake my gourd.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.014
I know this ritual!
The ancient shamans
were next called upon

10:48.048 --> 10:50.450
to do the "hokey pokey"
and turn themselves around.

10:50.482 --> 10:51.751
Go quest.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.726
(gourd rattling)

10:59.759 --> 11:01.061
(sighs)

11:09.903 --> 11:12.404
And that's what
it's all about.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.341
What you searching for,
Slayer, a weak spot?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.510
Hmm? Try me.
Give me the best you've got.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.349
(grunts, gasps)

11:22.381 --> 11:24.551
Is that your best,
Slayer?

11:24.583 --> 11:26.586
-No.
-Why not?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.923
I want to hurt you,
but I can't resist
the sinister attraction

11:29.956 --> 11:32.759
of your cold
and muscular body.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.861
Maybe I should repay you
for your gentleness.

11:34.894 --> 11:38.230
Maybe I should
let you go.
No! No, Spike.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.432
Never let me go.

11:40.466 --> 11:44.171
You know you should
be afraid of me.
I'm bad.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.375
You are.
You're very, very bad.
(grunts)

11:52.544 --> 11:55.783
-Are you gonna do it that way?
-No.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.553
This way.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.892
You can't do it.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.861
I could never do it.
I'm helpless against you,
you fiend.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.230
Oh!

12:17.904 --> 12:20.506
Buffy.

12:22.809 --> 12:26.078
(speaking foreign language)

12:47.967 --> 12:53.039
(purring)

12:54.374 --> 12:57.009
Hello, kitty.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.403
I know this place.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.542
Okay, Warning Spell's
all set.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.811
So that's it?
We're all protected-up
for the night?

14:04.844 --> 14:08.548
Well, it's probably not
as good as Willow could do.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.482
She's a natural with magic.
In just the time
I've known her,

14:10.517 --> 14:13.586
she's already blown
right past me.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.687
So when the whiz kid
gets back from chem lab,

14:15.721 --> 14:18.225
can you have her,
you know, bulk up
the spell a little...

14:18.258 --> 14:21.094
if you want, maybe,
while Anya and I
go do a quick patrol?

14:21.128 --> 14:25.498
Oh, I don't see why
we have to patrol
just 'cause Buffy's away.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.734
I mean,
I'd rather stay home
and watch television.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.769
TARA: Oh, yeah, Willow wants
to watch this thing on
the History Channel tonight.

14:30.802 --> 14:33.605
Salem witch trial stuff,
which is only gonna
get her all upset.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.774
ANYA:
I was there.
It really wasn't that bad.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.411
See, if you were really
a witch, you could
do a spell to escape.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.581
So, really,
it was only bad
for the falsely accused,

14:41.614 --> 14:43.750
And, well, they never
have a good time.
No.

14:44.616 --> 14:46.186
So, guys,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.788
if this is
a real slumber party,
where's the pizza?

14:51.790 --> 14:54.061
You're evil.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.096
And that excites you?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.198
It excites me,
it terrifies me.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.900
I try so hard
to resist you, and I can't.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.071
Yeah?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.438
Darn your
sinister attraction.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.375
Are you afraid of me?

15:09.408 --> 15:10.977
Yes.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.548
You know
I can't bite you.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.583
I think you can.

15:17.616 --> 15:21.120
I think you can
if I let you,
and I want to let you.

15:21.153 --> 15:25.993
I want you to bite me
and devour me
until there's no more.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.995
Like this?

15:29.196 --> 15:31.563
Oh, Spike, devour me.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.764
All right.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.302
Spike, I can't help myself.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.735
I love you.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.072
You're mine, Buffy.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.173
Should I start
this program over?

15:41.207 --> 15:44.443
Shh!
No programs.
Don't use that word.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.145
Just be Buffy.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.015
(chattering)

15:49.048 --> 15:50.250
It's got last week's
notes too.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.284
Just get it back to me
by Thursday.
Sure.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.421
And, uh,
don't write in it.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.323
Or-- Or, uh, put a coffee mug
down on it or anything.
Okay.

15:57.356 --> 16:00.192
And don't spill. Okay.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.794
Oh, and don't fold
the page corners down.
Bye.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.230
Bye.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.352
Time to slay.

16:26.385 --> 16:30.157
Yeah. Yeah.
(mumbling)

16:30.190 --> 16:32.359
Vampires of the world,
beware.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.278
(sighs)

16:57.517 --> 16:59.619
(owl hooting)

17:05.857 --> 17:07.294
ROBOT BUFFY:
Hey, there.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.195
-Buffy.
-Xander.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.335
And... Anya.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.836
How is your money?

17:16.867 --> 17:19.372
Fine. Thank you for asking.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.442
Isn't it a beautiful night
for killing evil things?

17:24.644 --> 17:28.079
-I guess.
-You're back very early.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.049
Yeah. How was the whole
vision-quest experience?

17:31.084 --> 17:35.255
I don't understand
that question,
but thank you for asking.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.390
You're my friend
and a carpenter.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.692
Are you all right?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.894
-You're all--
-Hey, there! Wait up!

17:42.929 --> 17:44.063
Spike!

17:44.096 --> 17:47.032
It's Spike,
and he's wearing a coat.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.436
Yes. Uh--
hello, all.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.740
Uh, Buffy's back early,
I see.

17:53.772 --> 17:57.443
Lots of patrolling
all around tonight,
then, is it?

17:57.477 --> 18:01.614
Ow! Hey! Give a fella
a break there, Slayer.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.916
I'm glad you're all here,
uh, 'cause, uh--

18:04.951 --> 18:08.255
'Cause the place
is crawling with
vamps tonight.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.057
Uh, tons of 'em.

18:11.089 --> 18:14.260
I think we oughta split up.
XANDER:
We haven't seen any vamps.

18:14.294 --> 18:18.431
-Are you sure there's--
-(growling)

18:18.464 --> 18:21.300
-You're right.
-Yep. Guess so.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.315
Spike, be careful!

18:45.023 --> 18:47.125
No. Get away from him.

18:56.236 --> 19:00.272
I think that was probably
the big action for tonight.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.974
You two can toddle
on home if you want.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.444
Uh, Buffy?

19:05.478 --> 19:09.316
Yes. Spike and I
will do it alone.
You guys head home.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.560
Hmm. I don't
understand this.

19:21.594 --> 19:26.298
I did the slaying.
I should be--
Satisfied?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.667
But I'm not.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.971
I'm all--
My skin is all hot.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.843
-Do I look hot to you?
-Always.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.878
You better feel me
to make sure.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.913
I can do that.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.818
Oh. (coughs)

19:46.853 --> 19:51.723
I breathed in, like,
a quart of vampire dust.
That can't be good.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.260
I wish Giles told us
they were back
from the desert.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.862
I wish I knew
what went on there.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.730
Oh, you know,
Slayer-Watcher stuff.

19:58.765 --> 20:02.368
Probably some silly ritual
with an enchanted
prairie dog or something.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.203
Whatever it was,
I think she's still
a little spacey.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.106
-She fought okay.
-Yeah.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.778
Hey, she never asked
about Dawn.

20:13.112 --> 20:16.883
-That's true.
-Something's wrong.

20:16.915 --> 20:20.185
(pleasurable moaning)

20:20.219 --> 20:24.557
-I hear something.
-Shh.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.192
Oh, Spike,
you're the big bad.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.061
You're the big bad.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.932
Those darn Salem judges,

20:32.964 --> 20:35.301
with their
less-satanic-than-thou
attitudes.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.369
Oh, honey,
let's change it.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.606
The Discovery Channel
has koala bears.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.112
Where's Dawn?
She's in the bedroom.
She fell asleep.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.146
-Good.
-What's goin' on?

20:48.180 --> 20:50.916
Buffy's gone insane.
WILLOW:
What?

20:50.950 --> 20:53.420
-What'd she do?
-Brace yourself.

20:53.452 --> 20:56.388
You're not gonna believe it.
Everyone,
before we jump all over her,

20:56.423 --> 21:00.159
people do strange things
when someone they love dies.

21:00.192 --> 21:03.229
When I lost my mother,
I did some pretty
dumb stuff,

21:03.261 --> 21:05.731
like lying to my family
and staying out all night.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.634
Buffy's
boinking Spike.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.070
Oh. Well,
Tara-- Tara's right.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.474
Grief can be powerful,
and we shouldn't judge--

21:15.508 --> 21:18.644
What, are you kidding?
She's nuts.

21:18.678 --> 21:22.914
Well, it's not healthy.
We're all agreeing there.
What can we do?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.417
Sometimes in the movies,
when they go crazy,
they slap 'em.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.185
I'm gonna go find her
and talk to her.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.155
If she's losing it,
we gotta help her
before she gets herself hurt.

21:30.189 --> 21:33.025
You aren't really
gonna slap her, are you?

21:33.058 --> 21:35.094
No, but if I have to see her
straddle Spike again,

21:35.126 --> 21:37.128
I will definitely
knock myself unconscious.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.707
Hello?
Who's there?

21:53.980 --> 21:56.682
(door rattling)

21:56.715 --> 22:01.119
-Who's that?
-Don't know. Down there.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.022
And no matter what,
don't come out
till I get you, okay?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.324
Okay.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.534
Oh. It's you.

22:14.567 --> 22:18.069
I saw you in the cemetery
with Buffy.

22:18.104 --> 22:22.240
Yeah? I can't see how
it's any business of yours.

22:22.273 --> 22:24.743
It is my business
because Buffy's my friend,

22:24.777 --> 22:27.846
and she's gone through
some stuff lately that--

22:27.880 --> 22:31.049
Well, it's affected her,
and you're taking
advantage of her.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.885
She's upset about
her mum. Mmm.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.890
And if she turns
to me for comfort, well,
I'm not gonna deny it to her.

22:37.923 --> 22:41.160
-I'm not a monster.
-Yes, you are a monster.

22:41.192 --> 22:44.596
Vampires are monsters.
They make monster movies
about them.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.333
Well, yeah,
you got me there.

22:47.365 --> 22:52.538
Spike, Buffy
has lots of friends,
and we love her very much...

22:52.572 --> 22:55.040
and we'll do whatever
it takes to protect her.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.042
Now, if that means
killing you,

22:57.076 --> 22:59.244
then, well,
that's just a bonus.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.515
Gentlemen,
I'm so sorry to intrude,

23:02.548 --> 23:06.051
but I wondered
if I might beg a moment
of your time.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.118
Friends of yours?

23:08.153 --> 23:09.288
Guess not.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.803
Tie his hands.
Miss Glory
will want him restrained.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.971
-Hey! Let me go!
-Careful with him.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.941
-She will want the key intact.
-Key?

23:28.974 --> 23:30.576
Who's a key?
I'm not the--

23:30.609 --> 23:33.480
(muffled shouting)

23:41.453 --> 23:45.124
I know you.
You're the First Slayer.

23:45.156 --> 23:49.161
This is a form.
I am the guide.

23:49.194 --> 23:54.133
I have a few questions
about being the slayer.

23:54.165 --> 23:56.568
What about... love?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.671
Not just boyfriend love.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.007
You think you're losing
your ability to love.

24:01.039 --> 24:03.009
I didn't say that.

24:04.810 --> 24:08.013
Yeah.
You're afraid that
being the Slayer

24:08.047 --> 24:10.182
means losing
your humanity.

24:12.551 --> 24:16.255
-Does it?
-You are full of love.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.424
You love with
all your soul.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.028
It's brighter
than the fire,

24:22.060 --> 24:24.329
blinding.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.566
That's why you
pull away from it.

24:29.167 --> 24:32.505
I'm full of love?
I'm not losing it?

24:32.538 --> 24:34.472
Only if you reject it.

24:34.507 --> 24:38.711
Love is pain,
and the Slayer forges
strength from pain.

24:38.744 --> 24:43.148
Love, give, forgive.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.352
Risk the pain.
It is your nature.

24:46.384 --> 24:48.855
Love will bring you
to your gift.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.858
What?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.060
Spike?

24:57.763 --> 25:01.099
I waited like you said,
but then I missed you.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.403
Spike?

25:04.435 --> 25:06.337
-(knock on door)
-Xander, did you--

25:06.372 --> 25:08.974
-Spike's gone.
-Buffy.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.344
Uh, come in.
Shh! It's late.

25:12.377 --> 25:14.246
Everyone's asleep.
Wait.

25:22.954 --> 25:24.856
We can talk out here.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.998
Did Xander find you?
He was looking for you.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.732
He hasn't come back.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.835
Anya sat up waiting.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.036
BUFFY: I don't know
where Xander is.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.671
I haven't seen him.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.373
And when I came
out of the tunnel,
Spike was gone.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.009
I need to find him.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.278
Um, Buffy,
this thing with Spike,

25:46.311 --> 25:48.114
it-it isn't true, is it?

25:48.146 --> 25:51.416
You didn't, you know,
sleep with Spike?

25:51.450 --> 25:55.622
No. I had sex with Spike.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.590
I'm sorry if it bothers you.
You're my best friend.

25:58.625 --> 26:04.063
I-I am, and I--
I always will be,
no matter what you do.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.732
I'm just trying
to figure out
why this happened,

26:06.766 --> 26:12.070
and I think with
your mom and everything,

26:12.104 --> 26:14.440
everyone was being
all sympathetic

26:14.472 --> 26:17.609
and-- and making you
feel weak,

26:17.644 --> 26:19.711
and Spike
wasn't like that.

26:19.746 --> 26:24.651
So just this one time,
you just did something
kinda crazy.

26:24.683 --> 26:25.984
It wasn't one time.

26:26.018 --> 26:29.221
It was lots of times
and lots of different ways.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.090
-I could make sketches.
-No!

26:32.124 --> 26:35.326
Buffy, there is something
seriously wrong here.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.663
I mean-- Well--

26:37.697 --> 26:40.633
Okay, yeah, you've been
with a vampire before,

26:40.666 --> 26:43.134
but Angel had a soul.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.673
Angel's lame.
His hair grows straight up,
and he's bloody stupid.

26:46.705 --> 26:50.142
Uh-- Okay.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.011
Look, I just wanna
help you.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.080
Let me help you.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.348
You're my best friend.

26:57.383 --> 27:01.319
Yeah. Again,
I really am, but--

27:01.353 --> 27:03.521
You're recently gay.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.156
Um--

27:05.191 --> 27:06.893
Guys! Guys, wake up.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.664
Oh, Xander. Oh.
I was scared.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.968
Are you hurt?
What happened?
Guys.

27:16.001 --> 27:19.538
-Demony kinds of guys. Buffy--
-Yes? That's me.

27:19.570 --> 27:23.342
The guys that work for Glory,
you said they're kind of
like hobbits with leprosy?

27:23.375 --> 27:26.478
Well, this is a whole
flock of hobbits,
and they just grabbed Spike.

27:26.511 --> 27:29.347
-I think they're
taking him to Glory.
-But he knows about Dawn.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.683
We have to get him back.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.685
So how do we find him?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.657
I fight with weapons.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.560
Yeah. I got nothin'.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.363
Let's hit your place.
We'll stock up.

27:44.395 --> 27:46.999
Tara, can you stay here
and watch Dawn?

27:47.032 --> 27:48.034
Of course.

27:51.537 --> 27:55.207
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little confused.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.243
I'm full of love,
which is nice,

27:58.277 --> 28:00.346
and love

28:00.378 --> 28:01.646
will lead me to my gift?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.914
Yes.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.683
I'm getting a gift,

28:05.718 --> 28:08.721
or do you mean
that I have a gift
to give to someone else?

28:08.755 --> 28:10.556
Death is your gift.

28:12.290 --> 28:15.361
-Death--
-Is your gift.

28:15.394 --> 28:20.098
Okay. No.
Death is not a gift.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.534
My mother just died.
I know this.

28:22.567 --> 28:25.037
If I have to kill demons

28:25.070 --> 28:28.406
because it makes the world
a better place,
then I kill demons.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.910
But it's not a gift
to anybody.

28:30.942 --> 28:34.246
Your question
has been answered.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.594
What the hell is that,
and why is its hair
that color?

28:48.626 --> 28:53.031
Stunning one, we believe
he is... the key.
The key.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.201
Really?

28:55.233 --> 28:58.604
That's fantabulous...
and impossible.

28:58.636 --> 29:01.140
He can't be the key...

29:01.173 --> 29:04.609
because, see,
the key has to be pure.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.946
(sniffs)
This is a vampire.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.615
Lesson number one:
vampires equal impure.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.417
Yeah, damn right.
I'm impure.

29:12.451 --> 29:15.453
I'm as impure as
the driven yellow snow.
Let me go.

29:15.554 --> 29:19.625
You can't even
brain-suck a vampire.
He's completely useless.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.759
So I'm just gonna
let myself out.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.997
But, Your Unholiness,
we observed the Slayer.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.898
She protected this one
above all others.

29:26.932 --> 29:30.301
She treated him
as precious.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.806
Really? Precious?

29:35.641 --> 29:38.076
Let's take a peek
at you, precious.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.278
(chuckles)

29:40.311 --> 29:43.348
-Sod off.
-Oh!

29:48.186 --> 29:49.654
(groans)

29:49.688 --> 29:52.523
-He doesn't look
very fancy to me.
-Hey, easy with the lip.

29:52.557 --> 29:56.095
But if the Slayer
protects him,

29:56.127 --> 29:58.897
maybe appearances
are deceiving.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.804
Maybe there's something
on the inside.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.174
(yelling)

30:10.709 --> 30:14.346
Shh! Shh!
What do you know, precious?

30:14.380 --> 30:17.316
What can I dig
out of you?

30:21.519 --> 30:24.823
This is my house.
If we're gonna stop Spike
from blabbin' about Dawn,

30:24.856 --> 30:27.326
we're gonna need these.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.863
Ooh!
The big guns.

30:30.896 --> 30:34.333
Only not guns.
Shouldn't we have guns?

30:34.365 --> 30:37.568
Those are my weapons.
Give me something
big and sharp.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.873
Um, Buffy, where do we go?
Where should we
look for Glory?

30:40.906 --> 30:42.974
She's a God.
She wants the key.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.443
Yeah, so we
should look--

30:47.113 --> 30:51.150
I don't know.
Why are you all looking at me?

30:51.182 --> 30:54.220
Okay, buff. It's okay.
You're right. You shouldn't
have to know everything.

30:54.252 --> 30:57.890
We need to rescue Spike.
WILLOW:
Um, Buffy?

30:57.923 --> 30:59.724
I think you have
more weapons upstairs.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.327
Why don't you
go get those?

31:02.361 --> 31:06.265
And maybe change
your clothes, you know.
Something more... fighty.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.634
I can do that.
I'll be right back.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.705
Okay, this has gone
way too far. She thinks
we're goin' to rescue Spike.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.708
What are we gonna do?

31:16.741 --> 31:19.678
Find him.
Keep him from talking,
whatever it takes.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.949
-What do we do with Glory?
-Whatever we do,
we're gonna need Buffy's help.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.951
Then we're gonna
have to talk to her.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.452
-Intervention time again?
-Yeah.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.990
-'Cause what we need right now
is a sane Buffy.
-Whoa. Group hang time?

31:33.224 --> 31:35.361
That-- That was quick.

31:35.394 --> 31:39.730
Didn't seem like it to me.
Death is my gift. Pfft.

31:39.765 --> 31:42.268
Buffy, we need to talk.

31:42.300 --> 31:45.237
What's wrong?
Is Dawn okay?

31:45.270 --> 31:49.607
-Dawn's fine.
-Buffy, we care about you,
and we're worried about you.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.310
- The way you're acting,
the things you're doing--
-It's wrong.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.114
Wait. This shouldn't be
about blame.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.249
Blame? There's blame now?

31:57.282 --> 32:01.452
No. There's only love
and... some fear.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.888
We're just kinda thrown
by the you having sex
with Spike.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.625
The who whating how
with huh?

32:06.657 --> 32:09.961
Okay, that's denial.
That usually comes
before anger.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.498
-I am not
having sex with Spike!
-Anger.

32:12.530 --> 32:15.933
No one is judging you.
It's understandable.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.336
Spike is strong
and mysterious

32:18.369 --> 32:20.239
and sort of compact,
but well-muscled.

32:20.271 --> 32:24.509
I am not having sex with Spike,
but I'm starting to think
that you might be.

32:24.542 --> 32:28.646
(chuckles)
Buffy, I saw you.
Anya too.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.683
We saw you and Spike
with the straddling.

32:32.718 --> 32:37.323
Spike's mine.
Who's straddling Spike?

32:37.355 --> 32:40.625
-Oh, my god.
-And so say all of us.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.794
Say, look at you.

32:42.827 --> 32:46.698
You look just like me.
We're very pretty.

32:46.731 --> 32:49.800
-Two of them.
-XANDER: Hey, I know this.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.202
They're both Buffy.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.472
No. She's a robot.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.476
She acts just like
that girlfriend-bot
that Warren guy made.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.179
You guys couldn't
tell me apart from a robot?

33:00.211 --> 33:02.980
Oh, I don't think
I'm a robot.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.650
She's very well done.

33:06.352 --> 33:09.555
Spike must have had her built
so he could program her to--

33:09.587 --> 33:13.325
-Oh, god.
-Yikes. Imagine the things--

33:13.358 --> 33:16.295
-No! No imagining,
any of you.
-I already got the visual.

33:16.327 --> 33:20.132
People, friends of mine,
you're forgetting the most
important thing.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.201
Glory has Spike,
and she's going to harm him.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.671
Glory has Spike?

33:25.703 --> 33:28.874
We were gonna
bring that up.
We were getting weapons.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.509
Grab 'em.
We're going now.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.845
I have to kill him.

33:33.878 --> 33:35.713
(scoffs) We don't even know
where to look.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.217
I know where to start.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.753
I have a riddle
for you, precious.

33:42.788 --> 33:46.724
How is a vampire
that won't talk
like an apple?

33:50.929 --> 33:54.099
(groaning)

33:54.133 --> 33:58.136
Think I can do you
in one long strip?
Enough.

33:59.938 --> 34:03.174
No more.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.411
I'll tell you
who the sodding key is.

34:13.119 --> 34:15.454
BUFFY: Glory's key-sniffing
snake was about here
when I killed it.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.623
It was headed back to her.
WILLOW: Do you think
she lives around here?

34:18.657 --> 34:20.958
XANDER:
It's not a lot to go on.

34:20.992 --> 34:24.362
It's all we got.
GILES: It's quite
extraordinary, really.

34:24.396 --> 34:28.733
Thank you. But I really think
we should be listening
to the other Buffy, Guy-iles.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.302
She's very smart, and she's
gonna help us save Spike.

34:31.335 --> 34:34.606
Guy-iles?
Spike didn't even bother
to program my name properly.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.742
Listen, skirt girl, we are
not going to save him.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.978
We're going to kill him.
He knows who the key is,

34:40.010 --> 34:42.079
and there's no way
he's not telling Glory.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.949
You're right. He's evil.

34:44.983 --> 34:48.652
But you should see him naked.
I mean, really.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.159
Okay, guys, split up
and spread out.

34:53.192 --> 34:56.295
Check the priciest-looking
places first.
Xander, you come with me.

34:56.327 --> 35:01.467
Willow, Anya, stick together.
And, Guy-iles--Giles,
you can watch it.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.679
-Is that better?
-(coughs)

35:13.711 --> 35:17.983
Do you think you can
try to talk again now?
Good.

35:18.016 --> 35:20.585
Because I'm tired
of these games!

35:20.619 --> 35:23.454
"I need time. I need a drink."
You're a very needy
little bloodsucker,

35:23.489 --> 35:25.324
and it's not
very attractive.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.295
So start talking.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.364
Yeah, okay.

35:32.398 --> 35:35.132
The key.

35:35.166 --> 35:37.001
Here's the thing.

35:39.338 --> 35:43.775
It's that guy... on TV.
What's-his-name.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.210
On the television?

35:45.244 --> 35:47.945
On that show,
the price show,

35:47.978 --> 35:50.349
where they guess
what stuff costs.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.385
-The Price is Right?
-Bob barker.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.521
We will bring you
Bob Barker.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.123
We will bring you
the limp and beaten body
of Bob Barker.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.791
It is not Bob Barker,
you scabby morons!

36:00.826 --> 36:04.195
The key is new
to this world,

36:04.230 --> 36:06.697
and Bob Barker
is as old as grit.

36:08.099 --> 36:11.302
The vampire is lying to me.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.572
(chuckling)

36:15.240 --> 36:20.346
Yeah. But it was fun.
And guess what, bitch?

36:20.378 --> 36:22.880
I'm not telling you jack.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.983
You're never gonna get
your sodding key,

36:25.016 --> 36:30.655
'cause you might be strong,
but in our world...
you're an idiot.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.358
I am a God.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.726
The God of what,
bad home perms?

36:35.760 --> 36:38.996
Shut up!
I command you shut up!

36:39.030 --> 36:42.568
Yeah, okay. Sorry,
but I just had no idea

36:42.601 --> 36:44.735
that Gods were such
prancing lightweights.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.072
-(chuckles)
-Mark my words.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.173
The Slayer
is going to kick

36:49.206 --> 36:52.844
your skanky, lopsided ass

36:52.878 --> 36:55.681
back to whatever place
would take

36:55.713 --> 36:59.284
a cheap, whorish,
fashion victim

36:59.318 --> 37:01.820
ex-God like you.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.293
Good plan, Spike.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.094
Bring him back.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.967
(elevator bell dings)

37:16.001 --> 37:17.302
Here!

37:22.807 --> 37:24.141
Oh, god.

37:47.264 --> 37:49.701
You do not insult Glory
by escaping.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.039
Slayer.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.239
Buffy, we're here.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.878
Spike!
Spike's in there!

38:51.329 --> 38:52.764
Buffy!

39:10.681 --> 39:13.351
-The Slayer was there.
-A lethal fighter.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.985
She seemed to be
everywhere at once.

39:15.019 --> 39:19.657
She had friends
with many weapons.
They may have been demons.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.260
And where's my vampire?

39:22.293 --> 39:24.228
(stammering)

39:25.963 --> 39:28.132
(both screaming)

39:33.739 --> 39:35.072
Is it weird?

39:36.373 --> 39:38.076
Oh, yeah.

39:38.108 --> 39:41.947
At least it's not
a very good copy.
I mean,

39:41.980 --> 39:43.949
look at it.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.152
Uh, yeah.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.755
(door closes)

39:51.989 --> 39:53.625
What did you guys
do with Spike?

39:53.659 --> 39:56.260
And please let the story
have a dusty ending.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.963
We dumped him
back in his crypt.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.297
Tried to find out if
he'd told her anything,

40:00.331 --> 40:02.199
but he was
too badly beaten
to make much sense.

40:02.233 --> 40:06.204
Well, even if he told her,
he'd just lie to us
about it anyway, right?

40:06.237 --> 40:09.608
Yeah.
You can count on it.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.610
But i have to know... now.

40:12.643 --> 40:15.413
If he did give us up,
Dawn and I need
to get out of town.

40:15.447 --> 40:19.384
-I mean, she could be
on her way right now.
-But not to worry, you know.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.418
I'm sure we'll all
be perfectly safe.

40:21.452 --> 40:24.088
We're safe. Right.

40:24.121 --> 40:26.858
And Spike built a robot Buffy
to play checkers with.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.929
It sounded convincing
when I thought it.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.331
Hey, I think
I found something.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.235
(groans)
Looks very complicated
in there.

40:38.268 --> 40:39.605
Personally, I'd rather
look at guts.

40:39.637 --> 40:42.007
I found
where she's broken.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.976
Some of these wires
got fried extra crispy.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.512
It's an easy fix.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.981
I mean,
not that I would.

40:50.014 --> 40:54.418
God, I feel kind of bad
for the guy.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.021
Gets all whupped,
and his best toy
gets taken away.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.625
Xander, please don't
be suggesting

40:59.657 --> 41:01.626
what I'd have to kill you
for suggesting.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.195
No, no. Travesty.
Completely on board.

41:04.228 --> 41:07.065
It's just...
the guy was so thrashed.

41:19.878 --> 41:23.581
Spike, you're covered
in sexy wounds.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.855
Yeah.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.659
I feel real sexy.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.996
Where you been?

41:38.028 --> 41:40.030
I fell down
and got confused.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.000
Willow fixed me.
She's gay.

41:42.032 --> 41:44.735
Wil fixed you?

41:44.769 --> 41:46.637
I thought they'd melt you
into scrap.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.940
They were confused too.
Do you wanna
ravage me now?

41:51.208 --> 41:53.844
Give us a minute.
Got some bones need mending.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.416
Why did you let
that Glory hurt you?

42:00.385 --> 42:02.253
She wanted to know
who the key was.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.556
Well, I can tell her,
and then you won't--
No!

42:04.590 --> 42:06.858
(coughs)

42:07.958 --> 42:09.994
You can't ever.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.429
Glory never finds out.

42:11.461 --> 42:12.931
Why?

42:14.132 --> 42:16.534
'Cause Buffy--

42:16.568 --> 42:20.606
the other
not-so-pleasant Buffy--

42:20.639 --> 42:24.074
Anything happened to Dawn,
it'd destroy her.

42:24.108 --> 42:27.545
I couldn't live,
her being in that much pain.

42:27.579 --> 42:30.447
I'd let Glory kill me first.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.317
Nearly bloody did.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.677
And my robot?

43:01.780 --> 43:04.048
The robot is gone.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.318
The robot was gross
and obscene.

43:07.351 --> 43:09.820
-It wasn't supposed to--
-Don't.

43:09.855 --> 43:13.958
That thing--
it wasn't even real.

43:23.934 --> 43:28.706
What you did
for me and Dawn--
that was real.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.045
I won't forget it.

44:25.996 --> 44:28.032
Grr! Arrgh!
