WEBVTT

00:11.410 --> 00:16.350
You're in trouble,
big, big trouble.

00:16.385 --> 00:17.815
Tell us
what we need to do

00:17.850 --> 00:19.985
to make this safe
for my girls.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.085
She's getting
bashed in the head.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.990
It's turned out to be
the house of horrors.

00:26.690 --> 00:28.090
They're living
here in danger?

00:28.100 --> 00:29.625
Yes.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.670
This is not good,
not good at all.

00:33.705 --> 00:35.887
I just hear death.

00:35.922 --> 00:38.070
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.700
God.

00:39.710 --> 00:40.710
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:40.745 --> 00:41.875
I see dead people.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.510
Her face was all demonic.

00:43.545 --> 00:45.075
I speak to dead people.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.980
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:48.015 --> 00:49.215
And they speak to me.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.145
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.990
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:54.025 --> 00:55.790
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

00:55.825 --> 00:57.392
I rely on my partner.

00:57.427 --> 00:58.925
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.690
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.190
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:02.200 --> 01:05.400
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.435 --> 01:06.560
They're everywhere.

01:06.570 --> 01:07.935
It's my job to reveal them.

01:07.970 --> 01:10.030
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.835
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.870 --> 01:14.870
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.075
...until the very end...

01:16.110 --> 01:17.745
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

01:17.780 --> 01:19.640
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:19.650 --> 01:21.715
That's it.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.010
...or time to get out.

01:23.020 --> 01:27.250
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:41.270 --> 01:42.830
I'm in the small town of Medina

01:42.840 --> 01:45.900
between Rochester
and Buffalo, New York.

01:45.910 --> 01:49.240
I got a call from a young
mom named Kelsey.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.310
Now, she was sobbing
saying the dead

01:51.345 --> 01:53.662
are going after her babies

01:53.697 --> 01:55.945
and brainwashing her mom.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.450
I'm not sure exactly what
the hell she meant by that.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.720
But she sounded
so scared for her kids,

02:00.755 --> 02:03.220
I had to take the case.

02:08.630 --> 02:09.824
Before Amy arrives,

02:09.860 --> 02:11.560
I sweep the house
from top to bottom

02:11.570 --> 02:14.270
looking for
any leading information --

02:14.305 --> 02:17.565
photographs, family heirlooms.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.940
Even a baby's crib
can influence her findings.

02:20.975 --> 02:24.280
So it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:24.315 --> 02:25.675
When I'm done, the location

02:25.710 --> 02:27.580
will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:40.390 --> 02:43.230
Boy.
This isn't good.

02:48.340 --> 02:51.005
So there's, like, you know,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.635
some dead people here who...

02:53.670 --> 02:55.510
I think that maybe
they can ****

02:55.545 --> 02:57.145
with living people.

02:57.180 --> 03:00.510
And they're bad.
They're very bad.

03:02.580 --> 03:05.720
And they want to do things
to living people.

03:05.755 --> 03:06.855
I don't know why there's

03:06.890 --> 03:08.520
so many **** dead
people in this house.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.485
Maybe it was a hospital

03:11.520 --> 03:15.790
or maybe it was
a crazy house at one time.

03:15.800 --> 03:20.365
Maybe it was a boarding house.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.170
And then, I hear there
are demons lurking.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.045
So, Kelsey,
I'm glad I'm here because

03:32.080 --> 03:34.050
when we spoke on the phone,
you sounded pretty upset.

03:34.085 --> 03:35.745
What's going on
in this house?

03:35.780 --> 03:38.320
My main concern
is my daughter Zoey.

03:38.355 --> 03:40.387
Um, she's 3 years old.

03:40.422 --> 03:42.420
She's seeing things.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.155
She's afraid.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.610
She won't go into
her room by herself.

03:46.645 --> 03:49.030
And you have,
another child as well?

03:49.065 --> 03:50.900
We have Lucy.
She's 2 months.

03:50.935 --> 03:52.895
Two small kids.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.700
Looks like it's
affecting you, too.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.235
Yeah.

03:56.270 --> 04:01.610
It's a daily struggle
just to keep the girls safe.

04:01.645 --> 04:03.205
The girls
are my main concern.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.740
And I have to stay
strong for them.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.430
As far as activity goes,
give me a --

04:08.465 --> 04:10.110
kind of a list
of what's happening.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.550
There's been loud screams,
things moving,

04:13.585 --> 04:16.601
shadow figures,
apparitions.

04:16.637 --> 04:19.620
And now
it's gotten physical.

04:19.630 --> 04:22.029
Okay. So how long have
you guys been here?

04:22.065 --> 04:23.925
We've lived here
18 months.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.800
Now, when I pulled up,
this place looked like a --

04:26.835 --> 04:28.835
a huge factory.

04:28.870 --> 04:30.770
Um,
how big is this place?

04:30.805 --> 04:32.487
It's 6,200 square feet.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.170
And it has 12 rooms.

04:34.205 --> 04:35.475
Wow.

04:35.510 --> 04:38.880
Now, do you know any history
about the house?

04:38.915 --> 04:41.275
We just know that it used
to be an inn.

04:41.310 --> 04:44.480
- And how old is it?
- It's about 200 years old.

04:44.515 --> 04:47.352
So who exactly
lives here?

04:47.387 --> 04:50.238
Myself,
my daughter Zoey,

04:50.273 --> 04:53.055
my daughter Lucy,
my mom.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.460
You mentioned on the phone
your mom's got some kind

04:55.495 --> 04:57.830
of strange connection,
obsession with the house.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.965
What's that all about?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.930
She seems to be
really attached to it.

05:02.940 --> 05:07.170
She doesn't seem to ever
want to leave the house.

05:07.205 --> 05:10.010
- That's strange.
- Since we've lived here,

05:10.045 --> 05:12.740
her health has just
declined rapidly.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.335
Is she the only
one getting sick?

05:15.370 --> 05:18.780
We're all exhausted
all the time.

05:18.815 --> 05:22.190
We all are sick
all the time.

05:22.225 --> 05:23.825
It -- it feels like home.

05:23.860 --> 05:26.660
But it feels like
we're sharing our home

05:26.695 --> 05:29.460
with something nasty.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.900
I don't even know
how anyone can stay here.

05:36.935 --> 05:39.600
There are just so many dead.

05:39.610 --> 05:41.575
I feel very dizzy.

05:41.610 --> 05:45.040
Very sick,
horrible, horrible...

05:45.050 --> 05:47.315
We can't focus.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.410
I think that the living here

05:49.420 --> 05:52.385
would experience
extreme sadness.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.250
When I first walked in,
I literally wanted

05:54.285 --> 05:58.520
to start crying,
extreme depression.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.330
All right, Kelsey.
This is a pretty big room.

06:07.365 --> 06:08.830
Why'd you bring me
in here?

06:08.840 --> 06:14.140
Well, one night I was sitting
right outside that door.

06:14.175 --> 06:15.640
All of a sudden,
I heard footsteps

06:15.675 --> 06:16.905
walking towards the door.

06:16.940 --> 06:21.745
And the door just slammed
right in my face.

06:21.780 --> 06:26.550
And so you hear, like,
footsteps like this?

06:26.585 --> 06:29.185
Yep.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.320
Any doors and windows
open for ventilation

06:31.355 --> 06:33.420
that this might've
slammed shut on its own?

06:33.430 --> 06:35.490
No, this happened
just a few weeks ago,

06:35.500 --> 06:38.000
when it was winter.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.535
Like that?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.735
Exactly.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.400
That must've scared
the hell out of you.

06:46.410 --> 06:48.910
Yeah.

06:52.310 --> 06:54.945
Living people, they have
a problem with the doors.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.780
The doorknob's always...
tch, tch, tch, always rattling.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.490
And all I'm seeing is --
is, like,

07:04.525 --> 07:07.327
the doors had blood on them.

07:07.362 --> 07:10.095
There was blood
on the floor.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.800
Something is trying
to get inside.

07:16.070 --> 07:17.035
Anything else?

07:17.070 --> 07:19.000
I looked up and saw
a woman walk

07:19.010 --> 07:22.270
from our dining room
into our kitchen.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.440
She was wearing
this long, white dress,

07:24.475 --> 07:26.527
looked like from
a long time ago.

07:26.562 --> 07:28.271
So did you go
into the kitchen

07:28.306 --> 07:29.980
to see
what the hell it was?

07:30.015 --> 07:32.115
The fear overcomes me.

07:32.150 --> 07:35.250
And I just can't bring myself
to walk in and see.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.855
Well, okay.
Anything else?

07:36.890 --> 07:40.120
Um, one night, I was sitting
down here on the couch.

07:40.130 --> 07:43.630
All of a sudden,
I heard this ear-piercing,

07:43.665 --> 07:47.065
horrific scream
of a woman.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.930
And it sounded like
she was being hurt.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.100
That was what was
startling about it.

07:55.140 --> 07:59.275
I'm hearing a woman screaming.

07:59.310 --> 08:01.910
Is she trying to get in?
Or is she trying to get out?

08:01.920 --> 08:05.120
They could see her, like,
as a full-body apparition.

08:05.155 --> 08:06.180
What would they see?

08:06.190 --> 08:08.890
Like a white dress
or something.

08:08.925 --> 08:11.590
I guess maybe, like,
a nightgown.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.305
Freaking out.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.555
Her heart's pounding.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.770
I think she was murdered.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.610
So this is Zoey's room?

08:35.620 --> 08:37.250
And the reason
I took the case,

08:37.284 --> 08:38.880
um, what's going on
in here?

08:38.890 --> 08:41.284
She would wake up,
start crying,

08:41.320 --> 08:44.420
refuse to lay back down,
refuse to go back to sleep,

08:44.455 --> 08:49.495
talking about shadow figures
and, mean men.

08:49.530 --> 08:54.770
One day, Zoey had got away
from us and took off.

08:54.805 --> 08:57.722
And we found her at the top
of the stairs

08:57.757 --> 09:00.640
holding what looked
to be someone's hand.

09:00.675 --> 09:03.240
My heart dropped.
I -- I stopped.

09:03.275 --> 09:04.445
I froze.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.730
It was one of
the more scary things

09:06.765 --> 09:08.980
that have happened here
for me.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.750
Okay. Anything else?

09:10.785 --> 09:12.015
Um, yeah.

09:12.050 --> 09:14.150
I will be walking up
the stairs,

09:14.185 --> 09:16.052
walking past this room.

09:16.087 --> 09:17.885
And I'll look
in the room.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.520
And there'll be
a black shadow figure

09:20.530 --> 09:22.915
standing right
in the window.

09:22.950 --> 09:25.265
It's happened three times.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.665
And I was literally
afraid for my life.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.030
So could there be
somebody standing outside

09:30.040 --> 09:31.470
and a car going by
with the lights

09:31.505 --> 09:33.070
and it reflecting
in here?

09:33.105 --> 09:35.470
No. It was very solid.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.910
Looked like an actual man
was standing there.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.340
What are you hoping
to get out of all this?

09:40.350 --> 09:41.675
Answers.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.145
Tell us
what we need to do

09:43.180 --> 09:46.420
to make this safe
for my girls.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.920
Okay.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.090
This person's
in big trouble,

09:56.100 --> 09:58.630
big, big trouble.

10:01.800 --> 10:06.400
This is not good,
not good at all.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.610
And I feel like
these dead people

10:08.645 --> 10:10.810
are very focused on this person.

10:10.845 --> 10:14.010
Violent, very violent...

10:16.720 --> 10:20.115
...anger, hatred,

10:20.150 --> 10:26.855
being surrounded by these
very bad dead people.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.490
And the only reason why they
would be focused on this person

10:29.500 --> 10:31.795
is because they think
they can make

10:31.830 --> 10:34.700
this person kill yourself
or kill everybody.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.440
This living person is in danger.

10:56.660 --> 10:59.160
So I was talking to Kelsey,
and she basically said

10:59.195 --> 11:03.060
that you're kind of
obsessed with the house.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.895
I guess that's fair.

11:04.930 --> 11:08.015
I knew
three steps in the door

11:08.050 --> 11:11.110
that this
is where we should be.

11:11.145 --> 11:14.170
It's turned out to be,
at times,

11:14.205 --> 11:17.005
the house of horrors.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.310
I understand you've been having
some health issues, too.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.080
I had to have
two back surgeries

11:22.115 --> 11:23.915
and a hip surgery.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.770
And I just can't seem
to heal here.

11:26.805 --> 11:29.555
Have you had experiences
living here?

11:29.590 --> 11:34.760
Yes. I've had experiences
with the walk-in closet.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.895
I thought to myself,

11:35.930 --> 11:38.160
"Maybe this is some
kind of a portal."

11:38.195 --> 11:40.835
You hear
a woman screaming.

11:40.870 --> 11:44.540
I mean, guttural,
painful screams

11:44.575 --> 11:47.005
come out of that closet.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.270
Well, how the hell
do you sleep in here?

11:48.305 --> 11:49.705
I don't sleep in here.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.810
I sleep in what
would be Zoey's room.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.545
I started sleeping
in there,

11:54.580 --> 11:57.065
thinking I would get
a better night's sleep.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.550
But it has not worked
out that way at all.

11:59.585 --> 12:00.615
Why not?

12:00.650 --> 12:03.320
I'm having
these horrific nightmares.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.685
Okay, what
kind of nightmares?

12:04.720 --> 12:08.590
Every single dream,
it has to do with somebody

12:08.600 --> 12:11.295
in this house
who is in peril.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.800
What do you think
is going on here?

12:12.835 --> 12:14.035
It's like this house

12:14.070 --> 12:16.170
is,
a paranormal highway.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.920
The living person
in this room gets sick a lot.

12:21.955 --> 12:26.040
There is a Satanic vortex
that's in their closet.

12:27.550 --> 12:28.745
Everything in this room

12:28.780 --> 12:31.320
that happens is due
to this **** closet

12:31.355 --> 12:34.115
and this ****
vortex in there.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.290
I think that they would
see things in there.

12:36.325 --> 12:37.585
Like what?

12:37.620 --> 12:39.920
I don't know,
maybe having dreams.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.695
Lots of stress.
Lots of stress.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.630
I see somebody, like,
crying so much

12:48.640 --> 12:50.330
they puke kind of thing.

12:50.340 --> 12:56.070
So scared, so scared,
crying and crying and crying.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.260
So anything else?

12:57.295 --> 12:58.405
The most significant

12:58.440 --> 13:00.040
and the most
frightening experience

13:00.050 --> 13:03.245
that I've had here
so far has to be

13:03.280 --> 13:05.780
walking over to the window
and looking out.

13:05.790 --> 13:11.790
And there were, like,
8 or 10 shadow figures.

13:11.825 --> 13:17.460
They were shaped
like a human form.

13:17.495 --> 13:19.965
But they were solid black.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.170
And they were just
staring right at the house.

13:23.205 --> 13:26.600
And just one by one,
they turned around

13:26.610 --> 13:30.070
and walked down
towards the river.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.875
It terrified me.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.440
You sure these were
shadow people

13:33.450 --> 13:35.650
and not a bunch of people
that were dressed in black?

13:35.685 --> 13:38.550
No. No, there's a street
light out there.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.515
And it was lit up.

13:40.550 --> 13:45.420
And you could see they were
this solid black forms.

13:45.430 --> 13:47.120
They weren't people.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.790
No.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.330
It's like you're
constantly anticipating

13:51.365 --> 13:53.495
what might happen next.

13:53.530 --> 13:56.270
And it's really difficult
to live like that.

13:56.305 --> 13:58.365
It takes its toll
on everybody.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.940
There's not a lot of life left
in this house anymore.

14:05.380 --> 14:10.510
I just saw, like, a really tall,
dark shadow man.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.450
And he just walked
straight right back

14:12.485 --> 14:14.487
and right into there.

14:14.522 --> 14:16.455
He was **** tall, too,

14:16.490 --> 14:20.520
'cause he must've been
right up on that tree there.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.630
He says that there's more.

14:31.170 --> 14:35.505
So those shadowed...things,

14:35.540 --> 14:37.840
they've been here
for a long, long time.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.145
I think that living people
would see them.

14:42.180 --> 14:47.820
But it doesn't seem like
they're much interested in them.

14:47.855 --> 14:49.450
Any idea how the living
would see them?

14:49.460 --> 14:52.620
Like human-shaped shadow people.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.530
Are the living here
in danger from them?

14:54.565 --> 14:59.600
I can't say 100%
that they're safe.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.255
Okay, Cindy,
why'd you bring me over here?

15:08.290 --> 15:10.805
I was walking down
this set of stairs.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.010
I got probably six
or eight stairs from the bottom.

15:15.045 --> 15:18.850
And it felt like somebody
took their arm

15:18.885 --> 15:21.185
and just swooshed

15:21.220 --> 15:23.950
and knocked my knees out
from underneath me.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.725
And I flew and hit hard.
- All right.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.960
So when I came up these steps,
these seemed pretty sturdy.

15:31.995 --> 15:33.565
They are.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.400
- You could've got killed.
- It's possible.

15:37.435 --> 15:40.005
And you're still
in this house?

15:40.040 --> 15:44.910
And you're gonna say
you're not obsessed by it?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.840
I don't want to leave it.

15:46.850 --> 15:49.350
Okay.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.385
There's a man.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.705
I think it's a man.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.730
But he sounds inhuman.

15:57.765 --> 15:59.720
He doesn't want us here.

15:59.730 --> 16:01.955
He grabbed my wrist and, like,

16:01.990 --> 16:04.260
pinched it between
the bones, you know?

16:04.295 --> 16:06.495
It, like,
almost felt like a ice pick.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.900
And then, he was grabbing
my neck here like,

16:09.935 --> 16:14.170
you know, this,
my shoulder,

16:14.205 --> 16:16.857
and then my jaw.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.475
He is very physical.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.610
As far as being able
to touch people.

16:22.620 --> 16:25.285
And then, I saw somebody
get shoved,

16:25.320 --> 16:29.420
a living person, a female,
get shoved from behind.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.690
So he's somebody
I would worry about.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.255
I think it's dangerous.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.530
I feel like he's, like,
trying to attach to me.

16:35.565 --> 16:40.200
My God.
**** Get off of me!

16:53.060 --> 16:55.065
So I made some calls,
and Kelsey's right.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.630
The house is almost 200 years
old and used to be an inn.

16:58.665 --> 17:01.165
I'm heading back there
to meet a local historian

17:01.200 --> 17:04.300
who says the guy that built it
had such a tragic time there,

17:04.310 --> 17:06.240
he probably wishes
he never laid his eyes

17:06.275 --> 17:07.940
on it in the first place.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.145
Sounds like my clients
were right.

17:16.180 --> 17:19.599
This place was built
about 200 years ago.

17:19.635 --> 17:22.811
Very close.
We found, um, that the house

17:22.847 --> 17:25.954
was actually constructed
around 1837.

17:25.990 --> 17:28.460
It's regarded as one
of the largest cobblestone

17:28.494 --> 17:30.365
buildings
in North America.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.770
She also mentioned
that it might've been an inn.

17:33.805 --> 17:35.635
Yes, that is correct.
It was an inn.

17:35.670 --> 17:39.055
Um, and it was there to cater
to the stagecoach traffic

17:39.090 --> 17:42.440
that was traveling from Buffalo
to Rochester at the time.

17:42.475 --> 17:44.110
And we actually have
a photograph here

17:44.145 --> 17:47.910
from 1870
that shows, um,

17:47.920 --> 17:50.520
what it would've looked like
from that time period.

17:50.555 --> 17:51.850
And this picture makes it
a lot more bustling

17:51.885 --> 17:52.985
than it is today.

17:53.020 --> 17:55.320
- Absolutely.
- What do we know about the guy

17:55.355 --> 17:57.155
that built this monster
of a house?

17:57.190 --> 18:00.490
The inn was constructed
by Zachariah Spencer.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.900
He was a wealthy farmer
from Connecticut.

18:02.935 --> 18:03.982
So you mentioned
on the phone

18:04.017 --> 18:04.995
that he's probably
even sorry

18:05.030 --> 18:07.950
he set eyes on this location.
Why was that?

18:07.985 --> 18:10.870
Yes, um, he turns the business
over eventually

18:10.905 --> 18:13.305
to his son Henry,
um, in 1843.

18:13.340 --> 18:16.595
Henry was about 28 years old
at the time.

18:16.630 --> 18:19.850
And at that point in time,
he is a loner.

18:19.885 --> 18:20.945
Um, he's not married.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.065
And he has no --
no children to speak of.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.150
That's kind of strange
for that time period.

18:25.185 --> 18:26.415
Isn't it?
- Yes.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.020
Okay. So now,
Henry's got the business.

18:29.055 --> 18:30.325
What happens?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.830
Um, from the best we can tell,
he runs it quite well.

18:32.865 --> 18:37.530
And then, two years later,
he kills himself.

18:37.565 --> 18:39.417
Okay, and how do
we know that?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.235
We do have
a deed transfer

18:41.270 --> 18:43.600
that reverts the property
back to Zachariah

18:43.610 --> 18:45.875
that says, um,

18:45.910 --> 18:49.405
Henry died at his own device.
- All right.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.150
Could we assume he committed
suicide on the property?

18:52.185 --> 18:53.515
Yes.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.415
Now that Zachariah's
got the property

18:55.450 --> 18:57.380
and the business back,
does he run it again?

18:57.390 --> 18:58.715
Or does he sell it?

18:58.750 --> 19:02.620
This time, he transitioned
the business to his other sons,

19:02.655 --> 19:04.355
Burrall
and Samuel Spencer.

19:04.390 --> 19:06.790
All right.
So how'd these guys do?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.490
Um, they overextended
themselves.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.230
And eventually ran
the business bankrupt.

19:11.265 --> 19:13.330
Burrall started,
forging checks

19:13.340 --> 19:16.270
about to
the extent of $270,000

19:16.305 --> 19:17.735
at that point in time.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.470
What are we talking about today?
What would that be?

19:19.505 --> 19:23.240
By today's standards
of about $6 million.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.640
Wow. Okay.

19:24.650 --> 19:27.950
So this poor guy, Zachariah,
comes over, successful guy.

19:27.985 --> 19:29.515
He's got all these kids.

19:29.550 --> 19:32.150
One kid, Henry, who's 28
and winds up killing himself.

19:32.185 --> 19:33.185
Yes.

19:33.220 --> 19:35.555
And then,
the other two knuckleheads

19:35.590 --> 19:38.190
wind up running the business
into the ground.

19:38.225 --> 19:40.060
- Yes.
- All right.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.065
There's, like, two guys.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.270
It feels like
older teens maybe.

19:48.305 --> 19:51.440
And they're bad.
They're very bad.

19:51.475 --> 19:53.105
I don't like these guys.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.275
I don't know
if they're human.

19:55.310 --> 20:00.045
They might be
pretending to be human.

20:00.080 --> 20:03.050
Like, I don't know
if they're really dead kids

20:03.085 --> 20:06.285
or if they're demons.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.920
And they're, like, talking about
Satanism and ****

20:09.930 --> 20:11.895
Them, you got to
bargain with them.

20:11.930 --> 20:14.490
Like, if you agree
for them to do something,

20:14.500 --> 20:16.860
then you're gonna ****
pay a price.

20:16.870 --> 20:18.195
That's all I know.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.130
What sort of things
will he do?

20:20.140 --> 20:21.730
They can scare them.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.990
They can harm them,
cause accidents,

20:25.025 --> 20:28.205
cause accidents
where people die.

20:28.240 --> 20:33.110
And I think also that they
influence the living very much.

20:33.145 --> 20:36.080
And I think that they could
influence a living person

20:36.115 --> 20:39.720
into harming themselves
or somebody else.

20:39.755 --> 20:42.160
It's not a good situation.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.595
If you need us
to investigate

20:48.630 --> 20:50.495
unexplained activity
in your home,

20:50.530 --> 20:52.915
go to "The Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.300
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story.

20:55.335 --> 20:56.370
And we'll help if we can.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.820
So far, I've got
a family worried sick

21:06.855 --> 21:08.920
over their children's safety
on a property

21:08.930 --> 21:11.965
where a former owner
committed suicide.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
But I need to see
if there's anything else.

21:15.035 --> 21:16.295
Searching through old records,

21:16.330 --> 21:18.930
I find a disturbing
article about a local farmhand

21:18.940 --> 21:20.605
who murdered a 13-year-old girl

21:20.640 --> 21:23.225
right next to
my client's property.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.170
Now, for some reason,
the local cops

21:25.205 --> 21:27.272
won't talk to me
about this case.

21:27.307 --> 21:29.340
So I reached out
to a local author

21:29.350 --> 21:31.480
who says this was one
of the most gruesome crimes

21:31.515 --> 21:33.980
in the town's history.

21:40.420 --> 21:42.720
Were you able to find out
anything about this farmhand

21:42.730 --> 21:44.155
that killed
this 13-year-old girl?

21:44.190 --> 21:47.700
Yes, the man we're talking
about is Eugene Emory.

21:47.735 --> 21:50.360
He was a farmhand
local to the area.

21:50.370 --> 21:52.170
And there's no known
photograph of him,

21:52.205 --> 21:54.900
but we did find
a sketch of him.

21:54.935 --> 21:55.905
Okay.

21:55.940 --> 21:59.175
He was described
as 5'8", clean-shaven.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.110
You have any idea how old he
might've been in this sketch?

22:01.145 --> 22:03.610
Yes, at the time that sketch
was done, 40 years old.

22:03.645 --> 22:04.815
40, okay.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.945
This guy have
any priors?

22:06.980 --> 22:10.335
Not really.
But farmers in the area

22:10.370 --> 22:13.655
had said that he liked
the young girls.

22:13.690 --> 22:16.520
Okay, so do we know when
he starts working for the people

22:16.530 --> 22:18.255
that live next door
to my client's property?

22:18.290 --> 22:21.210
He started working
for the Grimes family in 1888.

22:21.245 --> 22:24.130
Immediately was attracted
to their daughter, Cora,

22:24.165 --> 22:25.902
then about 12 years old.

22:25.937 --> 22:27.605
What do we know
about her?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.990
Described as
a very pretty girl --

22:30.025 --> 22:32.302
brunette with curly hair,
brown eyes.

22:32.337 --> 22:34.638
Supposedly, quite
a brilliant girl.

22:34.673 --> 22:36.940
He was actually
trying to court her.

22:36.950 --> 22:39.380
And they had been
seen out in the area

22:39.415 --> 22:40.985
in the horse
and carriage.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.770
He had brought her
a few little gifts.

22:42.805 --> 22:44.485
And the family knew
about all this?

22:44.520 --> 22:46.090
Well, they did.
I don't think, at first,

22:46.125 --> 22:48.520
they realized
it was that serious.

22:52.660 --> 22:54.665
I, feel weak,
real weak.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.985
Really, really,
really, really,

22:57.020 --> 22:59.270
really, really,
really weak.

22:59.305 --> 23:01.835
Hard to walk.

23:01.870 --> 23:04.540
I'm seeing the panicky girl
who was murdered again.

23:04.575 --> 23:06.757
And she's starting
to show me flashes

23:06.792 --> 23:08.940
of who she was
and what happened to her.

23:08.950 --> 23:12.110
She has dark brown hair,
white nightie,

23:12.120 --> 23:16.380
hourglass figure,
about 5'2", no shoes.

23:16.390 --> 23:22.960
It's warm, hot even,
sticky hot.

23:22.995 --> 23:25.397
Something's wrong here.

23:25.432 --> 23:27.800
Something's wrong here.

23:27.835 --> 23:30.430
My God.
My God.

23:33.900 --> 23:36.685
Take me to the murder.
What happened?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.470
Well, on June 24, 1889,
summer evening,

23:39.480 --> 23:42.180
Cora's parents
leave the premises.

23:42.215 --> 23:43.345
Okay.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.050
Well, Cora and Eugene
were having a discussion.

23:45.085 --> 23:47.385
And she's trying
to let him know

23:47.420 --> 23:49.150
that their relationship
isn't gonna go forward.

23:49.185 --> 23:50.655
And he's not liking this.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.855
She's trying to make it
clear to him

23:52.890 --> 23:54.820
that she thinks there's
too big an age difference.

23:54.855 --> 23:56.957
And he's not
the boss of her.

23:56.992 --> 23:58.826
She leaves to go
into the house.

23:58.861 --> 24:00.625
But in doing so,
she turns her --

24:00.660 --> 24:04.330
her back on him.
He picks up a piece of firewood.

24:04.365 --> 24:08.000
Using it like a club,
he bashes her in the head.

24:08.035 --> 24:10.322
That first blow
probably killed her.

24:10.357 --> 24:12.610
But he strikes her
two more times.

24:15.310 --> 24:18.210
She's getting bashed
in the head.

24:20.120 --> 24:24.090
Like, I'm just seeing
her head explode.

24:25.720 --> 24:29.975
And I'm seeing, like,
brain and hair.

24:30.010 --> 24:33.770
Something about
the evil that men do.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.552
I don't know who this is.
They're in me.

24:36.587 --> 24:39.300
That **** hurts.
- Who's jumping you?

24:39.335 --> 24:41.870
A chick who's being murdered.

24:41.905 --> 24:43.910
****

24:46.980 --> 24:48.740
Get out.

24:50.680 --> 24:51.815
All right.
So now what happens?

24:51.850 --> 24:53.780
Well, Emory takes off
through the woods.

24:53.815 --> 24:56.080
And the men form a posse.

24:56.090 --> 24:57.690
He sees 'em in the night
with their lanterns.

24:57.725 --> 24:59.990
And he knows they're
in pursuit of him.

25:00.025 --> 25:01.755
He turns himself in,

25:01.790 --> 25:05.160
confesses to the sheriff
that he loved this girl.

25:05.195 --> 25:07.225
He's weepy.
He's sobbing.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.295
But he doesn't know
why he did it.

25:09.330 --> 25:11.330
This was big news
at the time.

25:11.365 --> 25:12.635
What happened at trial?

25:12.670 --> 25:15.305
They do convict him
of second-degree murder.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.940
And he's sentenced
to life imprisonment.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.405
He ended up
dying in prison

25:19.440 --> 25:21.660
of natural causes,
kidney failure,

25:21.695 --> 25:23.880
after serving
almost 13 years.

25:30.620 --> 25:33.050
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.390
But what has me the most
concerned are the dead

25:35.425 --> 25:37.855
coming out of the vortex
in the closet

25:37.890 --> 25:41.560
and then surrounding
a living person in bed.

25:41.595 --> 25:45.482
There's dead people everywhere.

25:45.517 --> 25:49.978
There was a man on the left.

25:50.013 --> 25:54.440
And he's in his early 60s.

25:54.475 --> 25:57.345
Then there's a lady.

25:57.380 --> 26:01.045
And she's tiny.
She's probably, like, 5'2".

26:01.080 --> 26:04.990
And then, at the end of the bed,
just completely black.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.295
Amy,
is this what you saw?

26:10.330 --> 26:12.630
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.060
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:36.095 --> 26:38.160
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:38.195 --> 26:40.200
and our clients
for the first time.

26:40.235 --> 26:41.832
Now, Amy, this is Kelsey.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.430
And this is her mom, Cindy.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.100
It's like these ladies are
in a dysfunctional relationship

26:46.135 --> 26:47.300
with this house.

26:47.310 --> 26:49.470
And what I mean by that
is it tortures them

26:49.505 --> 26:51.175
physically and emotionally.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.740
But they're drawn to it like
they're obsessed with it.

26:54.750 --> 26:57.435
But there's a reason Kelsey
called us in.

26:57.470 --> 27:00.120
This is her 3-year-old
daughter, Zoey,

27:00.155 --> 27:02.215
and Lucy, who's a newborn.

27:02.250 --> 27:06.190
Kelsey's convinced that the dead
here are picking on Zoey.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.092
And she is not sure if
it's safe for them to be here.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.960
Now that Amy knows just
a little bit about you guys,

27:11.995 --> 27:15.770
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk for us.

27:15.805 --> 27:17.035
Something
about this location

27:17.070 --> 27:22.310
is that there were
a lot of dead people here.

27:22.345 --> 27:26.005
And I could not
figure out why.

27:26.040 --> 27:30.410
I was speculating maybe
it was an asylum or a hospital.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.685
Maybe it was
a boarding house.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.915
So I was extremely confused

27:34.950 --> 27:39.760
as to why there were all
these random dead people here.

27:39.795 --> 27:42.355
Some of them can
affect the living

27:42.390 --> 27:47.230
because I felt a lot of
depression and anxiety.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.130
Obviously, the house
is really old.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.765
Um, a lot of people
have been through here.

27:52.800 --> 27:57.170
It was built in 1837.
Originally, it was an inn.

27:57.180 --> 28:01.910
We actually have a photograph
of your place from 1870.

28:01.945 --> 28:03.215
Geez, it looks
about the same.

28:03.250 --> 28:04.550
- Yeah, there's nothing...
- That's crazy.

28:04.585 --> 28:07.180
Not much has changed.

28:07.190 --> 28:09.050
Now, as far
as depression goes,

28:09.085 --> 28:10.650
tell Amy about that.

28:10.660 --> 28:11.825
Since moving in here,

28:11.860 --> 28:13.920
I think we all are
drained and tired.

28:13.930 --> 28:17.060
And I think our attitudes
are different.

28:17.095 --> 28:18.965
Yeah.
I mean, there...

28:19.000 --> 28:22.070
I am always on edge, always.

28:22.105 --> 28:23.430
If it wasn't for Zoey,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.570
there would be no life
in this house.

28:28.810 --> 28:31.775
So I was outside.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.740
And I saw this thing,

28:34.750 --> 28:38.880
this really super-tall
dark shadow man, like,

28:38.915 --> 28:42.120
probably 30 feet tall
just glide,

28:42.155 --> 28:45.385
like, across the yard

28:45.420 --> 28:48.995
and then went
into the basement.

28:49.030 --> 28:52.600
And I saw just
all these shadow people.

28:52.635 --> 28:54.565
They were
kind of human size.

28:54.600 --> 28:58.540
I think that the living
might be able to see them.

28:58.575 --> 29:00.605
And they
didn't honestly seem

29:00.640 --> 29:04.360
at all interested
in living people.

29:04.395 --> 29:08.080
But you never know,
that could change.

29:08.115 --> 29:11.250
Well, Cindy's seen them outside.

29:11.285 --> 29:14.480
There were, like, 8 to 10

29:14.490 --> 29:18.920
just solid black mass figures
facing the house.

29:18.955 --> 29:22.642
And one by one,
they just turned around

29:22.677 --> 29:26.330
and walked right back down
to the river.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.647
Scared me half to death.

29:28.682 --> 29:30.930
I saw them three times.

29:30.940 --> 29:32.505
Um, each time, it was when

29:32.540 --> 29:34.600
I was walking past
Zoey's room.

29:34.610 --> 29:39.410
The third time, I got angry
and just stared at it.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.280
And that thing
didn't back down from me.

29:42.315 --> 29:43.845
It kept staring.

29:43.880 --> 29:47.250
Finally, I just got so scared,
I walked away.

29:52.060 --> 29:54.920
So what else?

29:54.930 --> 29:57.560
Then I went into
the master bedroom.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.082
- That's Cindy's room.
- Okay.

30:00.117 --> 30:02.535
And I saw
somebody crying.

30:02.570 --> 30:07.000
And they were scared
and hysterical,

30:07.010 --> 30:10.270
under a ton of stress.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.440
Yeah. I've shed my fair share
of tears here

30:13.450 --> 30:18.410
and just been moments
of just true despair.

30:18.420 --> 30:20.950
I also got that
the individual there,

30:20.985 --> 30:23.555
does get sick a lot.

30:23.590 --> 30:28.590
And that person sees
a lot of strange things.

30:28.625 --> 30:31.330
Um, and the reason
why is because

30:31.365 --> 30:34.182
when I went
into the closet,

30:34.217 --> 30:37.593
I saw this
dark, black hole.

30:37.628 --> 30:40.935
I really got evil
from it.

30:40.970 --> 30:46.240
And I said that it was
the Satanic vortex.

30:46.275 --> 30:48.577
I hate that closet.

30:48.612 --> 30:51.896
I hate that closet.

30:51.931 --> 30:55.180
I hear women screaming.

30:56.190 --> 31:00.220
And it sounds like
it's coming from that closet.

31:00.230 --> 31:02.455
Tell her about
your illnesses as well.

31:02.490 --> 31:06.130
I've had several back surgeries
and a hip surgery.

31:06.165 --> 31:09.770
I have had maybe six or eight
other procedures

31:09.805 --> 31:11.165
since we've been here.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.835
- What?
- I just can't heal.

31:13.870 --> 31:19.895
I'm just exhausted
and anxious and depressed.

31:19.930 --> 31:25.920
And I'm just fighting
to get my life back

31:25.955 --> 31:27.985
after these injuries.

31:28.020 --> 31:31.990
But at the same time, you don't
want to give up the house.

31:32.025 --> 31:33.907
I love this house.

31:33.942 --> 31:35.755
I got three steps in.

31:35.790 --> 31:38.760
And I knew that we were
supposed to be here.

31:38.795 --> 31:41.260
Interesting.

31:43.270 --> 31:46.405
In the master bedroom,

31:46.440 --> 31:50.310
I also saw a person
in the bed terrified.

31:50.345 --> 31:51.670
You talking 'bout Cindy?

31:51.680 --> 31:53.545
Yes.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.400
There were all
of these dead people,

31:56.435 --> 31:59.092
that were kind of
around the bed.

31:59.127 --> 32:01.750
So what did this look
like to you?

32:01.785 --> 32:03.320
I had a sketch done.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.420
I don't know
if I want to even open this up.

32:16.530 --> 32:18.940
There you go.

32:18.975 --> 32:20.800
My God.

32:23.010 --> 32:27.440
Wow.
Well, that's awful.

32:29.510 --> 32:32.380
Knowing that they're
targeting my mom,

32:32.415 --> 32:35.790
I mean, I just get angry.

32:35.825 --> 32:38.290
It's overwhelming.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.060
Did you see anything else?

32:47.070 --> 32:48.460
Yes.

32:48.470 --> 32:55.040
I met a dead male that is
very active in this house.

32:55.075 --> 32:57.740
And he is
a serious problem.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.905
He grabbed my arm

32:59.940 --> 33:05.010
and was pinching
through both of the bones.

33:05.020 --> 33:09.050
And it felt like an ice pick
going right through there.

33:09.085 --> 33:11.822
He absolutely did
not want me here.

33:11.857 --> 33:14.560
And I felt he could do
physical harm

33:14.595 --> 33:16.155
to living people --

33:16.190 --> 33:18.590
pushing, shoving,
hitting them.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.930
And I think
he could be dangerous.

33:23.470 --> 33:26.570
Well, dangerous is
an understatement.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.905
You could've been killed.

33:27.940 --> 33:30.270
I was coming down
the stairway.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.445
All of a sudden, it felt like
somebody took their arm

33:33.480 --> 33:36.610
and just knocked my legs
right up from underneath me.

33:36.645 --> 33:41.080
And I went down,
I mean, hard.

33:41.090 --> 33:43.620
Does that sound like this --
this scum bag would do that?

33:43.655 --> 33:45.825
Yeah.

33:45.860 --> 33:47.220
All right.

33:47.230 --> 33:49.790
So did you get anything
on this guy when he was alive?

33:49.825 --> 33:51.625
I saw
he was a white male.

33:51.660 --> 33:55.030
I think he was
in maybe his 40s.

33:55.065 --> 33:57.665
The other thing that I got

33:57.700 --> 34:01.240
was that he had murdered
a woman.

34:01.275 --> 34:03.175
I saw her briefly.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.070
And she was
in a complete panic.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.175
She was screaming.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.360
She was wearing
a white dress,

34:09.395 --> 34:11.510
dark hair,
she looked young.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.844
She was petite.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.820
And she wasn't
wearing any shoes.

34:14.855 --> 34:17.150
And it was hot
and sticky.

34:17.159 --> 34:21.420
Then I saw that she was
bashed in the head.

34:21.429 --> 34:22.625
And then
her head exploded.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.360
And I just saw the brain
and hair

34:24.395 --> 34:27.195
and everything
just go,

34:27.230 --> 34:29.250
Then I walked
in the kitchen.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.235
And she jumped
into my body.

34:31.270 --> 34:35.040
The pain was
absolutely excruciating.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.870
In the last 120 years,

34:37.880 --> 34:39.505
there's only been three women

34:39.540 --> 34:40.775
that have been murdered
in this town.

34:40.810 --> 34:44.150
One of them was right next door.
And it happened in 1889.

34:44.185 --> 34:45.580
The victim was
a 13-year-old girl

34:45.614 --> 34:47.185
named, Cora Grimes.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.650
And she was a beautiful girl,
dark hair, dark eyes.

34:50.659 --> 34:52.425
Now, the year before
she was murdered,

34:52.460 --> 34:56.060
the parents had hired
a farmhand named Eugene Emory.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.947
The guy became
obsessed with her.

34:57.982 --> 34:59.800
The guy was basically
a pedophile.

34:59.835 --> 35:02.465
She's 13. He's 39.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.000
You said the murder
probably happened

35:04.035 --> 35:05.565
when it was sticky and hot?

35:05.600 --> 35:08.670
Well, the murder took place
on June 24, 1889,

35:08.705 --> 35:10.875
so the hot time of the year.

35:10.910 --> 35:13.005
Now, Cora's parents
left for a bit.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.180
Emory approached Cora
and professed his love to her.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.450
She said to him,
"You're too old for me,"

35:18.485 --> 35:20.517
and turned her back on him.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.515
And this guy went into a rage.

35:22.550 --> 35:26.225
He picked up
a club-sized piece of firewood

35:26.260 --> 35:31.560
and took a shot at her head
and cracked her skull open.

35:31.595 --> 35:33.527
He wound up turning himself in.

35:33.562 --> 35:35.460
And, he ended up confessing.

35:35.470 --> 35:37.500
He basically said
he lost his mind over the girl

35:37.535 --> 35:39.605
and can't explain
why he killed her.

35:39.640 --> 35:44.940
Um, he ended up getting a life
sentence and dying in prison.

35:44.975 --> 35:47.040
Now, we don't have
a photo of him.

35:47.050 --> 35:52.110
But I did track down the sketch
somebody did in the courtroom.

35:52.120 --> 35:55.580
Um, I mean, it's a sketch,
but...

35:58.460 --> 36:01.360
...is it possible that's
the guy you might've seen?

36:01.395 --> 36:03.725
I don't know.
Possible.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.580
It's hard to tell
from that picture.

36:06.615 --> 36:08.992
But the case
sounds very similar.

36:09.027 --> 36:11.335
Everybody just says
I look so young,

36:11.370 --> 36:14.470
which is still creeping me out
that he's in this house.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.870
Anything else?

36:18.880 --> 36:21.310
When I went into
the living room,

36:21.345 --> 36:25.310
I saw
two teenage males.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.515
They're a big problem.
They're here.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.285
And I keep going back
and forth on, like,

36:29.320 --> 36:34.020
are they really these kids
or are they demons?

36:34.030 --> 36:37.830
Their little mission
is to create this havoc --

36:37.865 --> 36:39.797
torture people,
scare people.

36:39.832 --> 36:42.601
And they can influence
the living

36:42.636 --> 36:45.370
to harm themselves
or others.

36:45.405 --> 36:47.200
How would they get here?

36:47.210 --> 36:50.970
The freaking vortex.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.910
Now, you had mentioned
that they can cause people

36:52.945 --> 36:56.375
to harm themselves and others.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.315
There was a suicide on the
property you should know about.

36:59.350 --> 37:02.220
This place was built by a guy
named Zachariah Spencer.

37:02.255 --> 37:04.150
Come 1843,

37:04.160 --> 37:07.890
Zachariah turned his whole
business over to his son Henry.

37:07.925 --> 37:11.577
Two years after taking
over the business, 1845,

37:11.612 --> 37:15.230
Henry killed himself
right on the property here.

37:15.265 --> 37:17.330
Boy.

37:17.340 --> 37:19.000
I don't even want to ask her
if there's anything else.

37:19.035 --> 37:21.135
But did you see anything else?

37:21.170 --> 37:27.580
The room that I am
extremely nervous about

37:27.615 --> 37:30.832
is the blue room.

37:30.867 --> 37:34.015
Which is Zoey's room.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.620
Now, you sleep in Zoey's room?

37:35.655 --> 37:37.450
Yeah.

37:37.460 --> 37:40.460
I don't sleep in the master
bedroom anymore.

37:40.495 --> 37:43.090
So does Zoey sleep
in there with you?

37:43.125 --> 37:46.297
- No.
- She never did.

37:46.332 --> 37:49.435
Got it. Okay.
Interesting.

37:49.470 --> 37:53.300
The individual that
sleeps in that room

37:53.335 --> 37:59.480
is someone who is
in grave danger.

37:59.515 --> 38:01.775
Those specific dead

38:01.810 --> 38:05.010
are very focused
on that living person.

38:07.390 --> 38:09.890
So what the hell
do they want from Cindy?

38:09.925 --> 38:12.822
You've been subject
to that room

38:12.857 --> 38:15.720
where that horrible
vortex thing is.

38:15.730 --> 38:18.290
And they followed you.

38:19.960 --> 38:27.405
I think that they are
trying to possess you.

38:27.440 --> 38:34.340
I mean, they can jump you
and mold you into a killer.

38:34.350 --> 38:37.110
My gosh.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.620
They're probably
trying to get you

38:39.655 --> 38:42.237
as close to death
as possible

38:42.272 --> 38:44.820
'cause that would be
the easiest,

38:44.855 --> 38:47.142
time for them.

38:47.177 --> 38:49.395
That's scary.

38:49.430 --> 38:51.830
Goodness.
I wasn't expecting that.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.255
So, Kelsey,
you called us in

39:12.290 --> 39:14.060
'cause you're worried
about your kids.

39:14.095 --> 39:15.330
But it turns out,
your mother's

39:15.365 --> 39:16.725
the one that's in danger.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.460
To see if there's any way
you guys can stay here safely,

39:19.470 --> 39:21.230
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:28.310 --> 39:32.040
It just isn't
the right place.

39:32.075 --> 39:36.045
My goodness.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.920
And I think, honestly,
as quickly as possible,

39:38.955 --> 39:41.190
you need to get out
of the house.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.225
And once you leave,

39:45.260 --> 39:49.060
you then also need
to go for an exorcism.

39:52.570 --> 39:55.700
Once that's done,
all the attachments will go away

39:55.735 --> 39:58.300
so there'll be no more desire
to return

39:58.335 --> 40:00.372
and things like that.

40:00.407 --> 40:02.375
As far as this location,

40:02.410 --> 40:07.180
I don't think anyone alive
should live here.

40:09.850 --> 40:12.880
Kind of figured
something like that

40:12.890 --> 40:16.790
was gonna be
what the outcome was.

40:16.825 --> 40:19.290
Well, I wasn't.

40:25.830 --> 40:27.895
I love this house.

40:27.930 --> 40:29.135
You might feel differently

40:29.170 --> 40:31.740
once you're away
for a few months

40:31.775 --> 40:34.275
after you have
your exorcism.

40:34.310 --> 40:35.570
If she gets the exorcism
done right...

40:36.980 --> 40:38.410
...do you think she'll start
to heal a little bit better?

40:38.445 --> 40:41.210
Yeah.
Once you leave the location

40:41.245 --> 40:43.045
and you have the exorcism,

40:43.080 --> 40:45.985
I think you'll see
a dramatic change --

40:46.020 --> 40:48.890
your emotional state,
your mental state,

40:48.925 --> 40:50.757
your physical state.

40:50.792 --> 40:52.590
And if they stay?

40:52.625 --> 40:54.295
I just...

40:54.330 --> 40:56.390
That's just not
an option to me.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.995
I'm sorry.
But it's just not.

40:58.030 --> 41:00.060
Um, absolutely would
not recommend that.

41:00.070 --> 41:03.520
Well, I'm a little concerned
about you, though.

41:03.555 --> 41:06.970
I know what she's saying
that you need to do.

41:07.005 --> 41:09.970
But I'm wondering
if you're like,

41:09.980 --> 41:11.380
"I'm not giving up this house."

41:11.415 --> 41:13.645
No, I'm going.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.350
No ifs,
ands or buts about it.

41:16.385 --> 41:18.380
- Okay.
- Yep.

41:18.415 --> 41:19.815
Yeah.

41:19.850 --> 41:23.350
This is so much bigger
than what I thought.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.555
No house is worth this.
- No.

41:25.590 --> 41:29.530
I just didn't realize how
big of a nightmare we were in.

41:31.730 --> 41:34.600
The only way Cindy and
Kelsey can save their family

41:34.635 --> 41:37.435
is to move as far away
as possible.

41:37.470 --> 41:40.300
If they do that and get
an exorcism for Cindy,

41:40.310 --> 41:42.870
all of the attachments
to the dead will be broken.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.610
And they can begin to lead
a peaceful life.
