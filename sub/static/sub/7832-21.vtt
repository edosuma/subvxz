I'll go on the most popular program of the day.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.924
I assume that's still
Don McNeill and his Breakfast Club.

12:49.034 --> 12:53.164
Oh, get with the times, man.
It's Jerry Rude and the Bathroom Bunch.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.264
Oh, I don't think Mr. Burns
would like that show.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.775
<i>What's the matter?
Think I'm not hip?</i>

12:58.878 --> 13:02.314
I don't have enough-
[ Quoting Lyric ]

13:05.518 --> 13:07.918
Thank you, Knickknack and Paddywhack,
the Siamese midgets.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.454
We'll be sure to catch
your new series on Fox.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.751
Good luck, Mr. Burns.
And if you get in trouble...

13:12.858 --> 13:15.986
I wrote some jokes about how white people
are different from black people.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.222
- Hmm.
- How you doin', Mr. Burns?

13:18.330 --> 13:20.423
Jerry Rude.
Welcome to the show.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.501
[ Chuckles ]
I am pleased to-

13:22.601 --> 13:25.502
All right, let's get this geezer out quick
so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.164
You see, white people
have names like Lenny...

13:28.274 --> 13:31.243
whereas black people
have names like Carl.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.403
[ Laughing ]
Zoom!

13:34.513 --> 13:38.449
Now, Mr. Rude, I just want
you to know I'm a good sport.

13:38.551 --> 13:42.783
If you want to make fun of my legendary love
of cashews- [ Chuckles ] you have at it.

13:42.888 --> 13:46.085
Uh-huh. All right.
Uh, how many times a day do you go to the can?

13:46.192 --> 13:49.320
Oh, about 40, I suppose.
When are we going on the air?

13:49.428 --> 13:51.828
- We're on the air now, Skeletor.
- What?

13:51.931 --> 13:54.024
Question two:
How long is your wiener? Seriously.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.660
Great heavens!
What kind of Radiola show is this?

13:57.770 --> 14:00.432
All right, how about this?
When was your first gay experience?

14:00.539 --> 14:03.940
Oh, well, when I was six,
my father took me on a picnic.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.011
That was a gay old time.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.739
Ho-ho! I ate my share
of wieners that day.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.975
Oh, that sounds lovely.
[ Coughs ] Queer.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.211
[ Coughs ]
Queer. Um, ever murder anybody?

14:14.320 --> 14:17.756
Murder?
Well, mistakes have been made.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.849
Monty, I've heard you're a pretty flatulent guy.
Any comment on that?

14:20.960 --> 14:23.258
- Well, now, see here. Stop that.
- [ Farting ]

14:23.362 --> 14:25.262
<i>- Attention, wireless listeners.
- [ Farting Continues ]</i>

14:25.364 --> 14:28.390
Most of the sounds you are now hearing
are not being made by me.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.368
- Oh, stop! Stop!
Won't someone please stop the farting?
- [ Farting Gets Louder]

14:32.471 --> 14:34.371
Aah!
[ Groaning ]

14:34.473 --> 14:37.101
Don't worry, folks. He's not dead.
I still hear some faint sounds of life.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.109
[ Farting Continues ]

14:40.846 --> 14:42.746
That didn't go well, did it?

14:42.848 --> 14:46.477
- Good thing those lesbians knew C.P.R.
- Oh, what's the use?

14:46.585 --> 14:50.681
I'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire
like Arthur Fortune.

14:50.789 --> 14:54.691
Oh, Arthur Fortune.
[ Sighs ]

14:54.793 --> 14:57.489
You know what that
fabulous man just did?

14:57.596 --> 15:00.861
He gave the Springfield Zoo
two male pandas...

15:00.966 --> 15:03.730
<i>and got them to mate successfully.</i>

15:03.836 --> 15:06.202
And a stunt like that
impresses people?

15:06.305 --> 15:10.036
Oh, yeah. And I'm not easily impressed.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.042
Wow! A blue car!

15:12.144 --> 15:15.580
If a couple of Chinese bamboo-gobblers
can win people's hearts...

15:15.681 --> 15:20.709
I'm going to bring them something that man
has searched for since the dawn of time.

15:20.819 --> 15:24.687
- A sober Irishman?
- Even rarer.

15:30.562 --> 15:34.589
<i>[ Homer ]
Whew.! That was one long helicopter ride.</i>

15:36.302 --> 15:38.270
<i>##[ Bagpipes ]</i>

15:41.273 --> 15:43.639
Do you really think you can capture
the Loch Ness Monster?

15:43.742 --> 15:46.677
I mean, he's eluded Leonard Nimoy
and Peter Graves.

15:46.779 --> 15:51.079
[ Scoffs ]
Peter Graves couldn't find ugly at a Radcliffe mixer.

15:51.183 --> 15:55.142
<i>[ Clears Throat ] Hey. Hey. Let's see now.
We have the Monsterometer...</i>

15:55.254 --> 15:59.714
Flipper-finder, Hoax-a-Scope,
which is important for the looking and finding-

15:59.825 --> 16:01.986
Ugh. The whole town's turned out.

16:02.094 --> 16:04.028
I've never seen them so excited.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.894
<i>Hey, Willie.
That old couple looks just like you.</i>

16:09.001 --> 16:12.903
Aye. 'Tis my ma and pa.
They own a tavern hearabouts.

16:13.005 --> 16:18.500
They still have the same pool table on which
I was conceived, born and educated.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.639
- So you're back, Son.
- Aye.

16:22.748 --> 16:25.683
- I suppose you'll be leavin' soon.
- Aye.

16:29.421 --> 16:32.151
[ Grunting ] Good.
[ Muttering ] One more.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.762
Where's my monster, tubby?
What do you people think I'm paying you for?

16:37.863 --> 16:41.629
<i>- Uh, to work in your power plant?
- You're not payin'me anything.!</i>

16:41.734 --> 16:43.861
You kidnapped me.
I remember it distinctly...

16:43.969 --> 16:46.437
with the grabbing and duct taping
and the tennis ball in the mouth.

16:46.538 --> 16:50.167
- It hurt me.
- The beast looks something like this.

16:50.275 --> 16:53.244
- [Jingles ]
- Only without the saucy T-shirt.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.472
Check! Okay.

16:55.581 --> 16:59.517
## [ Whistling ]

17:04.189 --> 17:06.885
He's been down in
that icy water for hours.

17:06.992 --> 17:11.258
How can the lad survive
such brutal punishment?

17:16.234 --> 17:18.430
<i>- [ Bell Dinging ]
- [ Barking ]</i>

17:18.537 --> 17:20.436

- [ Buzzing ]

17:20.539 --> 17:23.406
[ Mutters ]
You monster!

17:23.509 --> 17:25.943
<i>[ Pinging ]</i>

17:26.045 --> 17:28.809
Oh, my great, good God.
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

17:28.914 --> 17:32.111
I am detecting a gigantic
amphibious life-form.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.777
It's 80 meters long,
and it's heading this way.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.412
Oh, good glavin!
It's on my shoe!

17:38.590 --> 17:40.490
- It's a- a small frog.
- [ Croaking ]

17:40.592 --> 17:43.060
Just get off.Just get off there.
Just get out. Get out!

17:43.162 --> 17:45.392
Stupid machine.
Oh, wait a minute.

17:45.497 --> 17:49.297
This isn't the Monsterometer.
It's the Frog Exaggerator! Oy.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.426
We're the laughingstock of the town.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.106
Don't worry, Mr. Burns.
We're gonna find that monster...

17:55.207 --> 17:57.175
no matter how long it takes.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.540
Besides, I'm getting kind of
used to wearing a kilt.

17:59.645 --> 18:03.581
[ Giggles ]
Can you believe I'm a size four? Whoo!

18:03.682 --> 18:04.944
- Ach.
- Aye.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.950
Oh, it's pointless hunting for an animal...

18:07.052 --> 18:10.283
that has 2 4 miles of water to hide in.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.653
- Drain the lake.
- What?

18:12.758 --> 18:15.955
You heard me.
Deploy the Delochinator.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.589
[ Groans ] Ooh!
[ Muttering ]

18:20.699 --> 18:24.999
Oh, pumping is hard.
[ Muttering ]

18:34.980 --> 18:38.211
- We've lost our homes
and everything we hold dear.
- Aye.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.719
I see it! I see the monster!

18:45.824 --> 18:51.592
Nae! There's merely Loch Ness High School's
discarded homecoming float.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.031
No way! Aberdeen rules!

18:55.134 --> 18:59.002
[ Roaring ]

19:00.439 --> 19:02.339
[ Screaming ]

19:02.441 --> 19:04.841
[Jingling ]

19:04.943 --> 19:08.071
- God, it's him!
- Come on, boys. Overpower it.

19:08.180 --> 19:12.446
- ## [ Whistling ]
- Fine. I'll do it myself.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.520
[ Grunting ]

19:16.622 --> 19:18.783
That was amazing, Mr. Burns!

19:18.891 --> 19:21.382
I was a little worried
when he swallowed me...

19:21.493 --> 19:23.461
but, well, you know the rest.

19:23.562 --> 19:27.862
Ah. And now for my triumphant return
to Springfield.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.967
Monster fever has gripped
Springfield by the throat.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.975
And it's all thanks to one man-

19:39.077 --> 19:43.446
Montgomery Burns has captured not only
a legendary monster, but also our hearts.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.074
And by the way, girls, he's single.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.953
Single? Well, he passes the Selma test.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.589
And now, presenting
the ninth wonder of the world-

19:58.697 --> 20:01.825
the eighth being Gomer Pyle's
heavenly singing voice-

20:01.934 --> 20:05.028
I give you the Loch Ness Monster!

20:05.137 --> 20:07.264
<i>- ##[ Fanfare ]

- Thank you. You're too kind.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.869
Yes, that's it. Let it all out.
Clutch me to your common bosom.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.312
Hey, look.
He's getting up.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.655
No, no. Stop it. Stop it.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.553
<i>- You'll enrage the beast.!
- [ Cooing ]</i>

20:26.658 --> 20:28.819

[ Shuddering ]

20:34.333 --> 20:37.564
<i>Aah.! Stop it.!
You're blinding me.!</i>

20:37.669 --> 20:40.069
Oh. Oh! I can't see.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.073
- Aah!
- [ Screams ]

20:43.175 --> 20:45.200
Run!

20:45.310 --> 20:48.074
<i>- Mr. Burns will kill us all!
- [ Screaming ]</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:51.439
Wait. Don't go.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.678
Love me!

20:55.921 --> 20:58.719
Well, if you wanted
people to love you...

20:58.824 --> 21:01.224
you sure blew it
with that insane rampage.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.226
- [ Sighs ]
- But you know what?

21:03.328 --> 21:05.592
To be loved,
you have to be nice to people...

21:05.697 --> 21:07.597
every day.

21:07.699 --> 21:10.532
But to be hated,
you don't have to do squat.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.536
You know, perhaps you're right.

21:12.638 --> 21:16.870
I got so swept up with the notion of being liked,
I completely forgot who I am.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.877
I'm a selfish old crank,
and that fits me like a Speedo.

21:20.979 --> 21:25.143
[ Cooing ]

21:25.250 --> 21:28.583
So what do we do with our friend here?
Uh, throw him in the Dumpster?

21:28.687 --> 21:33.488
No, no, no. I really want to give
the lovable scamp a good home.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.700
- D'oh!
- Tough luck, Simpson.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.964
- Come on, Nessie. One more pull.
- [ Roars ]

21:46.071 --> 21:49.131
Okay, okay.
Want a shrimp cocktail?
