you're always finding

Hey, Dad?
Hm?

00:06.750 --> 00:08.460
Can we go to Pinkberry?

00:09.500 --> 00:11.210
Sorry, baby.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.120
Pinkberry burned down.

Please?

00:24.170 --> 00:25.250
Uh, sorry, babies.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.750

01:25.960 --> 01:29.210
Listen, we made
an agreement with Jack.

01:29.210 --> 01:31.290
We promised.
-Oh, please.

on their promises constantly.

This family was built
on false promises.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.420
It's payback time.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.290
Dre, this has nothing to do with
the payback, and you know it.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.170
This is about
your issue with dogs.

01:56.170 --> 01:57.670
What are you talking about?
Mm...

01:57.670 --> 02:00.330
I do not have
an issue with dogs.

That's a dog,

02:09.330 --> 02:10.250
We should kick you!

02:12.420 --> 02:14.330
I had an issue
with that dog

02:14.330 --> 02:16.420
for trying to bite off
my daughter's face.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.420
And those people
treated me like a monster

02:18.420 --> 02:19.710
for protecting my baby.

02:19.710 --> 02:21.620
And the Chihuahua
was out for blood.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.750
Mm-hmm.
You talking about
that vicious beast

02:23.750 --> 02:26.080
that tried to attack
my grandbaby?
Oh, my God.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.420
Yes.
Uh-huh.

it would be

02:28.830 --> 02:31.920

Mm-hmm.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.380
You saw what happened
to your cousin Leon.
Yeah...

02:34.380 --> 02:36.790
I had to stop inviting him
to the family reunion

02:36.790 --> 02:38.420
'cause he was just
hard to look at.

02:38.420 --> 02:41.330
To be fair, Mama,
you didn't have to stop.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.000
That was your
personal choice.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.170
Well, he was hideous.

02:44.170 --> 02:46.290
It made me nauseous
to look at him.

02:46.290 --> 02:49.170
Okay, 12-year-old
Leon aside,

02:49.170 --> 02:51.960
I actually think a dog would
be really good for this family.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.380
How are we gonna
have a dog

02:53.380 --> 02:54.830
when we don't even know
how many kids we have?

02:54.830 --> 02:56.250
We have five children, Dre.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.040
Bow, we are not
dog people.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.380
How do you know that?

03:00.380 --> 03:03.120
Real Black people
don't mess with dogs.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.210
-Bonjour, family!
-Hey!

03:05.210 --> 03:07.290
-I'm back!
-Hey!

03:07.290 --> 03:11.120
Uh, it's a long story,
but I was asked to leave France.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.920
-Oh.
-Oh, this is Monsieur Luigi.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.500
He's my
emotional-support dog.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.000
So glad you're here,
but you're not helping my case.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.500
I know a place where you'd
never be asked to leave.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.290
This is the one
I was telling you about.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.500
Be cool.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
What's the matter, Dre?

03:30.500 --> 03:33.670
Bow and I were up
all night arguing.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.210
She's pressuring me
to get a dog.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.120
A dog?!

03:37.120 --> 03:39.460
Congratulations, Dre!

03:39.460 --> 03:41.960
That's far more exciting
than last year's news

03:41.960 --> 03:43.210
about your fourth kid.

03:43.210 --> 03:44.960
Five.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.250
Apparently,
I have five kids.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.250
Wow.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.170
That's way too many.
It's too many.

03:49.170 --> 03:50.670
Start sleeping
in separate beds.

03:50.670 --> 03:51.880
I'm just not a dog guy.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.670
Oh, I get it.
Because you're Black.

03:53.670 --> 03:55.920
You know, a lot of Jewish people
are afraid of German Shepherds.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.290
So it's a cultural thing.
That makes a lot of sense, Dre.

03:58.290 --> 03:59.580
Because you grew up
in the hood

03:59.580 --> 04:01.790
where you were surrounded
by vicious dogs

04:01.790 --> 04:02.960
that people
bought for protection

04:02.960 --> 04:04.250
but they couldn't control.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.670
So the dogs escaped,
and then they just

04:05.670 --> 04:07.420
wandered the streets
thirsty for blood.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.880
Uh...no.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.580
Well, then
it must be that because,

04:10.580 --> 04:12.170
during
the civil-rights era,

04:12.170 --> 04:14.210
dogs were used as weapons
against Black people

04:14.210 --> 04:16.040
by police and lynch mobs.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.420
No, but it probably
should be.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.830
Oh, then it's got to be
because during slave times

04:20.830 --> 04:23.210
they used "Negro Dogs" to track
and hunt Black people down.

04:23.210 --> 04:24.750
-Oh, yeah.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.790
You know, all of those
are amazing stories

04:26.790 --> 04:29.750

04:29.750 --> 04:31.290

04:31.290 --> 04:33.000
I don't want a dog.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.540
What?!
How is that possible?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.580
I am disappointed
in you, Dre.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.120

or -- or a Rott
named Baby Get-Right.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.790
-Yeah.

08:39.790 --> 08:41.250
I want people to cross the
street when they see me coming,

08:41.250 --> 08:42.710
and not just because
I'm a Black man.

08:42.710 --> 08:44.170
Well, if you need an argument

08:52.210 --> 08:54.250
Need any help?

08:54.250 --> 08:56.040
I'm fine.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.170
Yes.
You certainly are.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.920
Okay. Ruby,
I need to say something.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.500
While I'm here visiting,

09:03.500 --> 09:08.040
maybe we could cool it
on the weird flirty stuff, okay?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.500
Flirty stuff?

09:09.500 --> 09:12.330
Yeah, you know, like the comment
that you made yesterday.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.170
And like how you're
in my room now

09:14.170 --> 09:15.460
even though
the door was closed.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.460
And it was locked.

09:16.460 --> 09:19.830
Oh, Johan.
I am so sorry.

09:19.830 --> 09:24.710
I was simply complimenting you
on your undeniable good looks.

09:24.710 --> 09:29.460
Some might say you resemble
a modern-day Lionel Richie.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.960
I never meant to make you
uncomfortable.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.080
I feel terrible.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.790
Really?
So, we're cool?

09:35.790 --> 09:37.460
Oh, yeah.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.500
We cool.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.750
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.460
Hey, you really think
I look like Lionel?

09:42.460 --> 09:44.250
Maybe Commodores
Lionel.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.040
Before he got money.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.790
Dude. What the hell
are you doing?

09:58.790 --> 10:00.750
I'm getting you ready
for a big dog.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.290
And big dogs
love a lap.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.790
Dude...

10:05.790 --> 10:08.250
Junior, do you want me
to chop you in your throat?

10:08.250 --> 10:09.750
Oh, I'm not Junior.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.000
I'm a hundred-pound Rottweiler
with leash aggression

10:12.000 --> 10:13.120

he's a lapdog.

10:15.420 --> 10:16.500
Oh, my God.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.080
You want a dog?
I'll give you a dog.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.620
It's time to prepare you
for your new reality.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.080
Uh-oh!

10:25.080 --> 10:28.120
Look what I
got into.

Squirrel!

Squirrel!

Squirrel!
There's a squirrel!

10:39.830 --> 10:41.380
Junior, stop it.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.460
We're trying to do
our homework.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.710
Oh. Can I see that
for a second?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.000
Dude!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.120
Ptew!

10:50.120 --> 10:51.460
Dog just ate
your homework.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.710
What is wrong
with you?!

10:57.290 --> 11:00.000
Eugh.
Why is the floor wet?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.880
Because you were too lazy

Great news, Dre.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.830
-Mm-hmm.
-I found a Boxer Rescue.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.540
So, you get to get
the kind of dog you want

11:12.540 --> 11:14.880

It's my job to make sure
there aren't any

11:31.790 --> 11:34.080
potential dangers
around your home.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.710
Is our child
in danger?

11:35.710 --> 11:37.420
Oh, no, no.
Not him. Not him.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.580
The dog.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.920
Babies can be extremely
aggressive with pets...

11:41.920 --> 11:43.670
-Mm.
-...so...

11:43.670 --> 11:48.710
Will the baby be spending
much time inside the home?

11:48.710 --> 11:50.170
Lots of stairs.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.880
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, you know, dogs have legs.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.420
Some of them.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.250
-Oh.
-Ow.

11:57.250 --> 12:01.500
So as you can see, we have
a very dog-friendly car.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.580
And oh...

12:03.580 --> 12:05.120
Third-row seating.

12:05.120 --> 12:10.120
So, there's plenty of room
for our family and a dog.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.460
And then, oh...

12:11.460 --> 12:13.460
Ah, look at that.
So easy.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.830
Dog could probably do that
with his nose!

12:14.830 --> 12:16.710
Just open that seat up.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.250
We encourage you
not to teach your dog

12:18.250 --> 12:19.710
to move things
with his face.

12:19.710 --> 12:20.960
Oh.
Great.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.290
I didn't realize that.

12:23.670 --> 12:25.670
So, you're both aware
that someone is required

12:25.670 --> 12:27.120
to be at home with the dog
at all times?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Good.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.290
And your highest level
of education is?

12:31.290 --> 12:32.710
Oh, uh, M.D.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.960
I'm a doctor.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.420
-Wow.
-Yes.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.170
-Yeah.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.580
Your highest level
of education?

12:39.580 --> 12:41.620
Oh, B.A.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.710
Okay.
So, just college.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.880
What do you mean,
"just college"?

12:46.880 --> 12:49.420
It's just part of the process,
Mr. Johnson.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.830
We're only trying to ensure
that we place the animal

12:51.830 --> 12:53.170
in a suitable home.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.420
"Suitable home"?

12:55.420 --> 12:58.290
We have a yard
with a working water hose,

12:58.290 --> 12:59.920
which is more than I can say
for my cousins

12:59.920 --> 13:01.380
who live in Inglewood!

13:01.380 --> 13:03.250
So, next you're probably gonna
tell me that the dog

13:03.250 --> 13:04.330
is gonna need
its own driver.

13:04.330 --> 13:05.750
Is that what's
happening now?

13:05.750 --> 13:09.960
No. All we require is
a well-balanced diet, shelter,

13:09.960 --> 13:11.460
standard
health insurance.

13:11.460 --> 13:14.170
Health insurance?
For a dog?

13:14.170 --> 13:15.460
Dre, that totally
makes sense.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.040
I mean, we have seen patients
at the hospital

13:17.040 --> 13:19.080
who did not have
health insurance,

13:19.080 --> 13:20.500
and my God,
that was a nightmare.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.000
Okay, those patients
are people, Bow.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.040
And people
are not dogs.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.380
You're right.

13:26.380 --> 13:29.750
Dogs are much more
sensitive creatures.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.290
-I kicked a dog!
-Oh, my God.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.670
-Dre...

13:32.670 --> 13:35.080
So, I bought myself some time
on the dog issue

13:35.080 --> 13:37.420
and put my focus
back into work.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.880
And I think this is
a really good campaign

13:39.880 --> 13:42.790
that's gonna help us bring
these missing girls back home.

13:44.330 --> 13:47.420
Okay, okay, look.
This is ridiculous!

13:47.420 --> 13:49.250
All right,
whose idea was it

13:49.250 --> 13:50.920
to Bring Your Dog
to Work Day?

13:50.920 --> 13:53.330
Your little discussion
the other day on pets

13:53.330 --> 13:54.380
inspired us, Dre.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.000
So, I guess
it was your idea.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.170
Lookit -- we have to go through
an entire work week

13:59.170 --> 14:00.750
barely seeing
our loved ones.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.080
So, I thought,
why not designate

14:03.080 --> 14:05.580
a Bring Your Loved One
to Work Day?

14:05.580 --> 14:08.330
Okay, well why not
Bring Your Spouse to Work Day,

14:08.330 --> 14:10.750
or Bring Your Kid to Work Day
instead?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.580
Or...A Girl You Met
at the Club

14:12.580 --> 14:15.620
and You Want to Show Her
that You Have a Job to Work Day.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.420
And I thought you said
you didn't even like dogs.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.040
No. I said I don't like
German Shepherds.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.000
But Ella-Jo here
is a poodle.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.750
Aren't you?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.380
And you would never commit
genocide, would you, Ella

14:24.380 --> 14:27.000
No you wouldn't.
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.790
Is that $2,000
designer dog carrier?

14:30.790 --> 14:33.040
What's wrong?
I have seen you carry your baby

14:33.040 --> 14:35.420
in a Gucci bjorn
plenty of times.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.040
Why can't my baby
have the best, too?

14:37.040 --> 14:38.500
Because it's not a baby.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.080
Well, for those of us
who don't have children,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.580
we consider them
our babies.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.920
Dogs are way better
than babies.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.420
You never have to bail a dog
out of jail.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.420
You never have to send a dog
away to boarding school

14:48.420 --> 14:50.250
till things blow over
with the cops.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.000
I miss Switzerland.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.670
Dogs should not be
in the workplace.

14:53.670 --> 14:54.920
It's unsafe.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.670
How do we know that
one of these dogs

14:56.670 --> 14:58.040
isn't just gonna snap
on somebody?

14:58.040 --> 15:01.170
Oh, Duke would never
snap at anybody.

15:01.170 --> 15:02.460
Would you, David Duke?

15:02.460 --> 15:03.830
How would you know?

15:03.830 --> 15:05.580
He's an animal...

15:05.580 --> 15:06.830
named David Duke.

15:06.830 --> 15:09.420
Dre, you really need to
calm down, okay?

15:09.420 --> 15:12.000
I had no idea that our dogs
would make you so angry.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.710
No. You know what
makes me angry?

15:14.710 --> 15:18.620
People giving more consideration
to animals than people.

15:18.620 --> 15:22.120
This country was more upset
at Cecil the Lion's death

15:22.120 --> 15:24.620
than it was
about Mike Brown.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.040
-The same thing with Katrina.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.250
I remember you
all up in here

15:29.250 --> 15:31.750
rallying to raise money
for animals

15:31.750 --> 15:33.380
when people's lives
were at stake.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.880
Not true, Dre.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.460
We raised money for the
restoration of the Superdome.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.380
We put the Wetzel's Pretzels
in there.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.670
Hello!

15:40.670 --> 15:42.210
You guys sound crazy.

15:42.210 --> 15:43.290
Ain't that
the truth, brother?

15:44.830 --> 15:46.540
Wait a minute...

15:46.540 --> 15:48.710
Where are
Peaches and Herb?

15:52.170 --> 15:53.830
By the time I got home,

15:53.830 --> 15:56.790
I decided I didn't need
any more creative ways

15:56.790 --> 15:58.170
to say "no."

15:58.170 --> 16:00.170
We are not
getting a dog...

16:05.170 --> 16:06.920
Which seems to be
the right idea,

16:06.920 --> 16:10.040
since there's no one
watching you.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.080
Where's everybody at, huh?

16:15.960 --> 16:17.170
Once I told my family
we weren't getting a dog,

16:17.170 --> 16:20.210
I was immediately
iced out.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.580
Hey, guys!
Who wants some frozen yogurt?

16:21.580 --> 16:22.380
I'm buying.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.420
Junior?
What's your problem, man?

16:28.420 --> 16:29.920
You didn't even want
the dog.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.880
No. But I put in
24 thankless hours

16:32.880 --> 16:34.210
to prepare the twins
for one.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.580
I let them crate me.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.580
Fine. More frozen yogurt
for me.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.880
Move, Johan.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.540
Are you upset about
the dog thing, too?

16:51.540 --> 16:54.880
Actually, I'm kind of upset
about Ruby.
What?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.710
She seems to have forgotten
I even exist.

16:56.710 --> 17:00.210
All of her lack of attention
has made me vulnerable.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.580
Suddenly,
I'm insecure and needy.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.210
Tell me I'm enough.

17:04.210 --> 17:06.250
So, a woman
whose advances drove you

17:06.250 --> 17:08.670
to file a restraining order
from another country

17:08.670 --> 17:10.080
is now someone
that you miss?

17:10.080 --> 17:11.830
Desperately.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.170
Well,
I tried everything.

17:14.170 --> 17:16.420
I even offered Jack
to drive your car,

17:16.420 --> 17:18.540
and he told me to go take
a flying leaf.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.000
Ooh. Wow.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.420
He did not get
straight A's.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.000
Well, you know
what, Dre?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.380
You get what
you deserve.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.790
You put your selfish
feelings about dogs

17:26.790 --> 17:27.830
above everybody else's.

17:27.830 --> 17:29.500
Am I being selfish?

17:29.500 --> 17:32.460
Look, we have enough going on
with our family and our kids.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.920
I just didn't want another thing
to be responsible for.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.120
What are you
responsible for?

17:36.120 --> 17:40.460
