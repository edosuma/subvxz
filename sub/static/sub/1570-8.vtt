FRANCINE:
Stop!

01:57.598 --> 02:00.033
I have heard enough
of this song and dance.

02:00.067 --> 02:02.769
You're just lucky I don't beat
you like my dad did to me.

02:02.803 --> 02:06.439
In fact, let's pay
a visit to my dad

02:06.473 --> 02:09.408
so you can see what happens to
naughty boys when they grow up.

02:11.445 --> 02:13.646
Dad, tell him
how much jail sucks.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.515
Tell him about the beatings,
the rapes,

02:15.549 --> 02:18.317
the overly washed
Egyptian cotton bath towels.

02:18.352 --> 02:20.286
Tell him
so he'll stop being bad.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.522
Steve, just be happy
you're bad now

02:22.556 --> 02:24.357
and not when I was boy.

02:24.391 --> 02:26.392
Back then, Krampus
would have come for you.

02:26.427 --> 02:27.627
Krampus?

02:27.661 --> 02:29.395
Yes, Krampus.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.465
The demon of Christmas.

02:32.499 --> 02:34.100
<i>When I was a boy</i>
<i>in Southern Bavaria,</i>

02:34.134 --> 02:36.569
<i>in lower Berchtesgaden,</i>

02:36.603 --> 02:39.338
<i>Santa would ride with Krampus.</i>

02:39.373 --> 02:41.340
<i>Santa would give gifts</i>
<i>to the good kids</i>

02:41.375 --> 02:44.143
<i>and Krampus would punish</i>
<i>the naughty ones.</i>

02:44.178 --> 02:47.180
<i>Scare you</i>
<i>with his rusty chains.</i>

02:47.214 --> 02:49.182
<i>Slap your bottom</i>
<i>with his birch branches.</i>

02:49.216 --> 02:51.084
<i>And if you were really bad,</i>

02:51.118 --> 02:53.319
<i>he'd throw you</i>
<i>in his almost child-sized sack</i>

02:53.353 --> 02:55.321
<i>and shake you good!</i>

02:55.355 --> 02:57.256
<i>Oh, that's Krampus for you.</i>

02:57.291 --> 02:59.358
Yeah, sounds like a
load of bull jizzle.

02:59.393 --> 03:00.793
I've never heard of Krampus.

03:00.828 --> 03:03.830
That's because your gramps
trapped the demon, he did.

03:03.864 --> 03:05.431
<i>On Christmas Eve,</i>

03:05.466 --> 03:08.034
<i>I snuck out of bed</i>
<i>to get more of Mother's strudel</i>

03:08.068 --> 03:10.670
<i>even though she told me</i>
<i>I couldn't have any more.</i>

03:10.704 --> 03:11.971
<i>I didn't care.</i>

03:12.005 --> 03:13.072
<i>I wanted more.</i>

03:13.107 --> 03:14.373
<i>When I got there,</i>

03:14.408 --> 03:16.943
<i>I saw that Krampus</i>
<i>had beat me to it.</i>

03:16.977 --> 03:20.113
<i>He was neck-deep</i>
<i>in Mutter's strudel.</i>

03:20.147 --> 03:22.515
<i>So I trapped him</i>
<i>in that copper pot.</i>

03:22.549 --> 03:24.584
Copper-potted him good.

03:24.618 --> 03:26.652
And that's why you
and all the other baddies

03:26.687 --> 03:30.123
never get a visit
from Krampus on Christmas Eve.

03:30.157 --> 03:31.290
That's nonsense.

03:31.325 --> 03:32.625
See for yourself.

03:32.659 --> 03:35.061
That copper pot is with my stuff
in your basement.

03:35.095 --> 03:36.762
Okay, okay, I'm bored.

03:36.797 --> 03:38.798
Let's go.

03:38.832 --> 03:40.299
Krampus is real.

03:40.334 --> 03:41.734
Real I say!

03:41.768 --> 03:43.102
The copper pot's
in your basement.

03:43.137 --> 03:44.203
It's right there

03:44.238 --> 03:46.439
with my old Rossignol skis!

03:46.473 --> 03:49.041
They're super-long
and super-fast!

03:50.077 --> 03:52.078
Check your basement, Stan!

03:55.182 --> 03:56.716
So, Hayley, have you decided

03:56.750 --> 03:58.151

04:42.596 --> 04:44.197
The bar gets busy

04:44.231 --> 04:45.665

04:45.699 --> 04:47.066

this Speedo, Jeremy?

05:02.416 --> 05:04.250

05:04.284 --> 05:07.086
Is it a tandem Speedo
for two men?

05:08.222 --> 05:09.855
Eh, even this is too loose.

05:09.890 --> 05:11.757

05:23.937 --> 05:25.771
what do you think you're doing?

05:25.806 --> 05:27.807
I am hiding these

05:46.627 --> 05:48.628
No, Jack's my dad.

05:48.662 --> 05:51.063
Let... me... out.

05:51.098 --> 05:52.832
I can't. You're a demon.

05:52.866 --> 05:54.233
I-It would be...

05:54.268 --> 05:55.501
unwise.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.737
Release... me.

05:57.771 --> 05:59.038
STEVE:
Hey, bitch!

Where's my Mickey Mouse towel?!

06:00.841 --> 06:02.041
FRANCINE:
I'm sorry!

06:02.075 --> 06:03.542
I'll try harder!

06:03.577 --> 06:05.611
Okay. If I let you out,

06:05.646 --> 06:08.147
will you promise to scare my
son and make him a good boy?

06:08.181 --> 06:09.248
Yeah!

06:09.283 --> 06:11.284

what I do, man.

<i>You did</i> what?!

06:35.116 --> 06:36.383
I released Krampus.

06:36.418 --> 06:38.686
I just wanted him to
scare Steve straight.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.755
Sexual orientation
is not a choice!

06:41.790 --> 06:43.324
What?

06:43.358 --> 06:44.992
Look, Krampus took Steve,

06:45.026 --> 06:46.627
and he says he'll only
give him back

06:46.661 --> 06:47.861
if you take his place.

06:47.896 --> 06:49.229
What do you say, Dad?

06:49.231 --> 06:51.599
If I use my CIA connections
to get you out of re,

06:51.633 --> 06:53.300
will you switch with Steve?

07:00.508 --> 07:02.076
I'm in.

07:02.110 --> 07:05.546
Krampus probably took him
to his castle in Bavaria.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.714
I know where it is.

07:06.748 --> 07:08.182
Give me the keys.
I'll drive.

07:08.216 --> 07:09.516
(cackles)

07:09.551 --> 07:11.685
See you, sucker!

07:13.121 --> 07:15.122

07:28.003 --> 07:29.169
Let me go!

07:29.171 --> 07:30.971
What are you doing?

07:31.006 --> 07:32.039
Krampus is back.

07:32.073 --> 07:33.273
He's been gone for, like,

07:33.308 --> 07:35.476
50 years or something,
you guys.

07:35.510 --> 07:37.344

09:44.606 --> 09:46.507

09:46.541 --> 09:48.375
Want to tell me <i>who</i> you did?

09:48.409 --> 09:49.777
(whispers):
Was it a boy?

09:49.811 --> 09:51.245
Krampus kidnapped Steve.

09:51.279 --> 09:53.514
And the only one who knows
where to find him is Jack.

09:53.548 --> 09:54.615
And Jack took off.

09:54.649 --> 09:55.616
Krampus?

09:55.650 --> 09:57.417
Santa's evil sidekick?

09:57.452 --> 09:58.852
Santa must know where he is.

09:58.887 --> 10:01.221
Santa won't help me.
Santa hates me.

10:01.256 --> 10:04.458
I'm coming for you, Smiths!

10:04.492 --> 10:05.692
Hyah!

10:05.727 --> 10:07.027

Look, even if I wanted
to ask for Santa's help,

10:09.130 --> 10:11.131
how am I supposed to get
to the North Pole?

10:11.166 --> 10:12.766

10:49.704 --> 10:52.072
Way harder.

10:58.112 --> 11:01.348
How dare you come to my house.

11:03.484 --> 11:05.252
Krampus.

11:05.286 --> 11:06.753
What about him?

11:06.788 --> 11:08.789
He's been gone over 50 years.

11:08.823 --> 11:10.257
No, Krampus is alive.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.125
And he has my son.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.927
Who cares about your son?

11:13.962 --> 11:16.029
I can't go back
to sharing Christmas

11:16.064 --> 11:18.165
with that
soul-singing goat.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.434
Always nibbling on my list.

11:20.468 --> 11:21.835
Please, I need your help.

11:21.870 --> 11:23.503
I need to find Steve.

11:23.538 --> 11:25.038
Okay.

11:25.073 --> 11:27.341
I'll help you get your boy

11:27.375 --> 11:31.411

11:32.480 --> 11:33.714
Deal.

11:33.748 --> 11:35.082
Come on, Roger.

11:35.116 --> 11:36.817

11:36.851 --> 11:39.286
I'm almost there.

11:40.822 --> 11:42.089

11:56.104 --> 11:57.804
You guys seem okay.

11:57.839 --> 12:00.073
But that Krampus
is a real jerk.

12:00.108 --> 12:01.775
Oh, that's not true!
That's not the way.

12:01.809 --> 12:03.143
(all babbling)

12:03.177 --> 12:05.913
Krampus cares about you
more than anyone.

12:05.947 --> 12:08.849
He cares enough to punish you
when you're bad.

12:08.883 --> 12:11.885
That's cause he's a monster
who enjoys terrorizing kids.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.021

14:04.966 --> 14:06.867
He seems like a
total lost cause.

14:06.901 --> 14:10.771
Which is exactly why I need
to apologize to him.

14:10.805 --> 14:12.005
Apologize?

14:12.040 --> 14:14.374
It's my fault
he turned out bad.

14:14.409 --> 14:16.476
I should have been
beating his ass

He cared about kids.

Santa just spoils them.

And I make a hell of a lot

18:32.876 --> 18:34.677
(laughing)

18:42.085 --> 18:43.185
Kids don't buy toys.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.287
You give toys away.

18:44.321 --> 18:45.621
How does that make money?

18:45.656 --> 18:47.423
Do not overthink this.

So I am.

20:21.218 --> 20:24.687
I suppose this is how I'm
to repay my debt to the world

20:24.721 --> 20:27.390
for taking Krampus away
all these years.

20:27.424 --> 20:29.592
So, will you remain
Krampus forever?

20:29.626 --> 20:30.926
Like, all the time?

20:30.961 --> 20:32.261
Who knows?

20:32.295 --> 20:34.029
In the meantime,
it's Christmas Eve,

20:34.064 --> 20:37.299
and I've got a lot
of bottoms to blister.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.935
(Jack laughing)

20:41.071 --> 20:43.139
You better be good,
boys and girls,

20:43.173 --> 20:45.741
or I'll beat you until blood's
coming from your ears

20:45.776 --> 20:47.543
and your eyes and your mouth.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.378
Merry Christmas!

20:49.413 --> 20:51.113
And from your ass.
