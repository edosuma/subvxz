WEBVTT

00:01.613 --> 00:04.075
I have to show a house today,
so see you guys at Luke's football game.

00:04.077 --> 00:05.056
I'm too tired to go.

00:05.057 --> 00:06.201
I have a midterm tomorrow,

00:06.202 --> 00:08.951
which I'll probably fail and
I was up really late studying.

00:09.192 --> 00:11.793
She was. I was up
really late doing this.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.062
Don't even bother coming.
I'm quitting today.

00:15.231 --> 00:17.765
I'm sick of this guy on the team
always making fun of me.

00:17.769 --> 00:18.558
He's just jealous because

00:18.559 --> 00:20.240
you're the one who puts
points on the board.

00:20.411 --> 00:23.377
- Why? Because you run the scoreboard
- run the scoreboard.

00:24.068 --> 00:24.847
I'm out, too.

00:25.044 --> 00:26.509
But all your classmates
will be there.

00:26.644 --> 00:27.906
We ignore each other all week.

00:28.136 --> 00:29.666
It's nice to have a little break
on the weekends.

00:29.667 --> 00:32.386
Geez, I've never seen
such a bunch of no-getters.

00:32.387 --> 00:33.173
Coined it!

00:33.448 --> 00:35.134
Remember, keep
a positive attitude,

00:35.135 --> 00:36.601
and good things will happen.

00:37.312 --> 00:39.099
Two things I bring
to every open house --

00:39.221 --> 00:41.438
my lucky pen and a smile.

00:42.182 --> 00:43.189
I haven't sold
a house all month.

00:43.190 --> 00:45.367
Do you see me saying
"I'm done"? Never.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.986
Because there is
no "done" in Dunphy.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.606
I'll see you guys at the game.

00:51.132 --> 00:54.164
Hey, there is no "umph" in Dunph--
different spelling!

00:54.972 --> 00:55.936
Cam!

00:57.092 --> 00:58.706
Yes, Phil, I remember
your special play,

00:58.707 --> 01:01.029
but I think the triple
gull-wing is a little tricky

01:01.030 --> 01:03.063
to run at such an important
sporting match.

01:04.150 --> 01:07.284
Cam has a number
of delightful superstitions

01:07.285 --> 01:08.353
during the football season.

01:08.354 --> 01:10.474
Well, they're not superstitions
when they work.

01:10.623 --> 01:11.867
That seems science-y.

01:12.439 --> 01:16.137
Not sorry that today
is the last g-a-m-e.

01:16.779 --> 01:19.468
Well, thank you, but
good coaches don't need luck.

01:20.156 --> 01:21.149
We make luck.

01:21.505 --> 01:22.993
See you at the athletic endeavor.

01:23.603 --> 01:26.008
I'm going to call Gloria and
see if she can pick up Lily, too,

01:26.009 --> 01:26.874
you know, just in case...

01:26.875 --> 01:28.233
What, you procrastinate again

01:28.234 --> 01:29.512
and not tell Charlie
you're quitting?

01:29.666 --> 01:30.828
No, no! I'm gonna do it.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.255
I just -- I'm picturing
his face when I tell him,

01:33.294 --> 01:36.176
shaking his head in disappointment.
It's -- it's hard.

01:36.177 --> 01:38.011
- Hey, just do it!
- No.

01:38.383 --> 01:40.612
I don't know why you're making
yourself so crazy over this.

01:40.613 --> 01:41.404
You're right. You're right.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.844
I -- I do not want to be crazy.

01:43.566 --> 01:44.524
I'll see you at the game.

01:46.762 --> 01:47.602
Hey, Gloria.

01:47.752 --> 01:49.687
Yes, Mitch, I will pick her up.

01:49.763 --> 01:52.116
Thank you so much!
All right. Bye, Lily.

01:52.181 --> 01:53.812
Good luck with
the whole Patrick situation.

01:53.845 --> 01:55.672
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.192
Well, welcome to the rest
of your life, sweetheart.

01:58.733 --> 02:01.352
So, Lily, tell me more
about this Patrick.

02:01.596 --> 02:04.050
He likes the swings,
he sits by the flag,

02:04.161 --> 02:05.760
and he can count to 100.

02:06.612 --> 02:08.202
He sounds like
the whole package.

02:08.217 --> 02:09.336
Then what is the problem?

02:09.529 --> 02:10.608
He doesn't notice me.

02:10.753 --> 02:12.394
So then make him notice you.

02:12.761 --> 02:14.343
You don't want
to wake up one morning

02:14.351 --> 02:15.417
as a lonely 9-year-old,

02:15.418 --> 02:17.737
wondering where
all the time went.

02:19.545 --> 02:21.251
Hey, mom.
If you're at the store later,

02:21.252 --> 02:22.522
could you pick up some ice?

02:22.523 --> 02:23.821
I'm gonna need it
for after the game.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.820
My little athlete.

02:24.852 --> 02:26.939
I want to try out the gelato maker
I traded my bike for.

02:27.552 --> 02:28.880
Lures me in every time.

02:29.050 --> 02:30.402
Oh, okay. Bye.

02:31.624 --> 02:33.319
Dad, you can just drop me
at the next light.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.230
I can walk from there,
and I got to call Phil anyway.

02:35.299 --> 02:36.289
You did the same thing yesterday.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.394
Why? What's going on with you?

02:37.772 --> 02:40.331
- You smoking again?
- No! No.

02:40.422 --> 02:42.415
I just -- I don't want
to put a spotlight

02:42.416 --> 02:43.963
on the fact that
I'm the boss's daughter.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.029
It makes people resent me.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.147
- This is good. Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.

02:46.148 --> 02:47.134
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:52.617 --> 02:53.858
I can see that bothers you.

02:53.859 --> 02:54.914
Well, yeah, your own kid,

02:54.915 --> 02:56.805
embarrassed to be seen
with you, you know?

02:57.470 --> 02:59.048
- You spend your whole life --
- Here's fine.

03:15.798 --> 03:18.694
Last month, a law-school
classmate offered me a job

03:18.695 --> 03:19.792
at his legal aid society,

03:19.793 --> 03:21.310
and I just knew
I had to take it.

03:21.648 --> 03:23.638
And I explained that
in a letter

03:23.639 --> 03:25.808
that I was going to sneak
onto Charlie's desk.

03:26.338 --> 03:27.723
Oh, good. It's you.

03:27.757 --> 03:29.556
Hey! Did you sleep here?

03:32.580 --> 03:35.693
My girlfriend dumped me,
uh, in an e-mail.

03:36.186 --> 03:37.568
Couldn't even do it
face-to-face.

03:38.424 --> 03:39.446
Pretty gutless, huh?

03:39.940 --> 03:41.826
Oh, you should go home,
get some rest.

03:42.566 --> 03:44.280
I can't go back there.
It would be too hard.

03:44.468 --> 03:45.549
Mm, too many memories?

03:45.550 --> 03:47.815
No, we were living on my boat.
I don't know where she took it.

03:48.029 --> 03:49.603
Enough of my whining.
What do you need?

03:49.618 --> 03:53.845
Oh, well, I just --
I just came by to say hi. Hi.

03:54.487 --> 03:59.356
And also, mm, to tell you
in a very gut-ful fashion,

03:59.357 --> 04:00.200
face-to-face,

04:00.308 --> 04:02.361
about something that
I have been thinking about.

04:02.362 --> 04:05.421
But I do think that, um,
I am going to have to leave

04:05.422 --> 04:06.936
about five minutes early today.

04:07.444 --> 04:10.801
Uh, Cam is -- is coaching
a high-school football game.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.341
- I'm in.
- What?

04:12.682 --> 04:14.880
Certainly not gonna be able
to focus on any of this today.

04:14.881 --> 04:17.435
Yeah, I need a shot
of marching bands,

04:17.435 --> 04:20.213
fresh-cut grass,
rosy-cheeked kids.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.384
Hey!

04:22.310 --> 04:23.687
Do they still run through a banner?

04:23.710 --> 04:25.780
- They do!
- I love that. I love that.

04:26.644 --> 04:28.678
Let's see.
The game's at what, like, 4:00?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.861
We should probably --
Hey! Give me that.

04:31.412 --> 04:32.391
I'm --

04:32.443 --> 04:33.512
this is my private cell.

04:34.629 --> 04:37.401
Only three people
in the whole world use this.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.127
Two people.

04:41.708 --> 04:44.140
Uh, Claire, is, uh --
is there a reason

04:44.224 --> 04:45.499
you didn't sign
this shipping form?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.258
Oh, no. Sorry.
I'll do it now.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.980
Oh, no. No. Now's a little late.

04:49.094 --> 04:50.061
See, they came in this morning,

04:50.062 --> 04:52.402
and they can't do a thing
without a manager's signature.

04:52.445 --> 04:53.740
So now I've got
100 rosewood panels

04:53.741 --> 04:54.956
- lined up in the warehouse.
- Oh, my God.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.494
In the future, I'd appreciate it --

04:56.495 --> 04:57.968
Hey, hey, Tim.
I think you made your point.

04:57.969 --> 04:59.506
It was an honest mistake, all right?

04:59.507 --> 05:02.009
- Dad -- - I'm just saying
that it's what a warehouse is for,

05:02.134 --> 05:02.977
to hold things.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.725
- Not the end of the world. Right.
- Of course.

05:06.854 --> 05:08.405
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

05:08.554 --> 05:10.681
It's my fault.
Bye, Tim. Bye!

05:11.253 --> 05:12.041
Dad!

05:12.151 --> 05:13.539
This is exactly what
I was talking about

05:13.540 --> 05:14.627
in the car this morning!

05:14.940 --> 05:16.813
I want them to see me
like a co-worker,

05:16.864 --> 05:18.550
not somebody who's
getting special treatment

05:18.551 --> 05:19.711
'cause she's the boss's daughter.

05:19.740 --> 05:22.690
Is it possible you're being
a little oversensitive here?

05:22.800 --> 05:26.188
No, I'm not. I'm being --
Wow, here? Really?!

05:26.189 --> 05:27.412
You know, you gave me this.

05:27.507 --> 05:30.350
- Look how adorable you were.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

05:30.388 --> 05:33.097
I want you to try really hard
to hear what I'm saying.

05:33.642 --> 05:35.899
When I need your help,
I will ask for it.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.825
And until then, just butt out.

05:42.613 --> 05:43.656
What happened to you?

05:48.458 --> 05:50.007
Hey, Miller, your toes
are looking a little lonely.

05:50.008 --> 05:51.355
Why don't you pay them a visit?

05:51.443 --> 05:52.715
What's with the extra
warm-ups, coach?

05:52.716 --> 05:54.130
These guys haven't won all year.

05:54.277 --> 05:55.306
Did you hear that, team?

05:55.981 --> 05:57.594
Miller just bought you
a little present.

05:57.595 --> 05:59.145
I wasn't complaining. I was just
wondering why we have to --

05:59.146 --> 06:00.009
Take a lap!

06:01.480 --> 06:05.975
Burt Levoisier, Red Stagg,
Duckie Pond --

06:06.618 --> 06:08.212
all coaching legends
at this High School

06:08.223 --> 06:10.401
and none have won more
than two games their first season.

06:10.687 --> 06:12.411
I win today, that makes three,

06:12.412 --> 06:16.252
making me the winningest
first-year freshman coach ever.

06:17.639 --> 06:19.304
Oh, hey, Luke, Reuben's sick,

06:19.305 --> 06:21.369
so I'm gonna need you
to be the announcer today.

06:21.370 --> 06:23.771
How am I supposed to keep score
and announce at the same time?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.894
Same way you're a spaz and
a dork at the same time, spork.

06:26.895 --> 06:29.335
Okay, lose the attitude,
but keep that intensity.

06:32.447 --> 06:33.291
Uh, hey, excuse me, ref.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.087
What's with all
the black arm bands?

06:35.143 --> 06:36.779
Their coach passed away last night.

06:37.268 --> 06:38.361
He'd been sick for a while.

06:38.451 --> 06:40.762
That's terrible.
And we're still playing?

06:40.810 --> 06:41.850
Well, they're tough kids.

06:42.131 --> 06:43.975
Roger Knight lived
for high-school football,

06:43.976 --> 06:45.462
so they're playing
this one in his honor.

06:46.328 --> 06:47.956
Okay, hey, guys!
Guys! Guys! Guys!

06:47.957 --> 06:49.430
Tragic news about Coach Knight.

06:50.032 --> 06:51.528
But you know what?
We need to focus up.

06:52.116 --> 06:53.539
Plenty of time to pay our respects,

06:53.540 --> 06:55.593
but there will be no mourning
knight this afternoon.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.367
- Lot of character over there.
- Yep.

06:58.727 --> 07:00.499
- Those kids haven't won a game all year.
- Uh-huh.

07:00.836 --> 07:02.160
And now to have
to play on his birthday...

07:02.161 --> 07:03.463
Okay, see you at the coin toss.

07:05.188 --> 07:06.131
Top of the morning!

07:07.683 --> 07:09.583
Real estate and,
to a lesser extent, life

07:09.584 --> 07:10.944
is all about perseverance.

07:12.959 --> 07:13.803
Things go wrong.

07:14.774 --> 07:17.728
Keys get lost, deals fall through,
keys get misplaced.

07:18.461 --> 07:20.365
Uh, a lot of it
has to do with keys.

07:20.553 --> 07:23.470
But that's when you find out
there are two types of people --

07:23.890 --> 07:26.345
those who waste time
staring at a closed door...

07:27.279 --> 07:29.688
And those who find a window.

07:39.354 --> 07:41.392
I'm looking at my first month
ever without a sale.

07:41.871 --> 07:42.980
Some people might give up.

07:43.414 --> 07:45.503
But those people
aren't Phil Dunphy.

07:46.562 --> 07:47.517
No!

07:48.445 --> 07:49.625
It's like I tell my kids --

07:52.300 --> 07:55.207
keep a positive attitude
and things will fall your way.

07:58.974 --> 08:01.030
As my favorite redhead once sang,

08:01.343 --> 08:03.152
the sun will come out tomorrow.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.398
That redhead,
of course, was Mitchell,

08:12.504 --> 08:15.420
introducing me to
the plucky orphan Annie...

08:21.877 --> 08:24.387
whose never-say-die attitude
pulled this country

08:24.388 --> 08:26.052
out of a little thing called...

08:26.960 --> 08:28.717
The Great Depression.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.424
And anything a little girl can do,
I can try to do, too.

08:34.312 --> 08:35.369
Hey!

08:57.310 --> 08:58.968
Hey, guys! Welcome back!

08:59.195 --> 09:01.832
- Drink it in!
-  Wow!

09:03.191 --> 09:04.301
Pretty great, huh?

09:04.390 --> 09:07.785
Oh, am I glad you guys could
see this during the daytime.

09:07.786 --> 09:10.131
I really think it shows
better like that.

09:10.689 --> 09:11.534
So?

09:11.841 --> 09:14.013
Should we just cut to the chase
and pay me my commission?

09:14.257 --> 09:15.596
I'm kidding.
You don't pay me directly.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.619
There's no fee in dun-- Phil.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.196
Listen, Phil, we've got
some great news.

09:19.197 --> 09:21.114
I love it!
Where's my lucky pen?

09:22.209 --> 09:23.807
We wanted to tell you
this in person.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.898
- We just came from the doctor --
- I'm pregnant!

09:26.086 --> 09:28.257
Oh, my God! You guys!

09:28.376 --> 09:30.108
Except we decided
to put off buying the house

09:30.109 --> 09:32.090
- until after the baby's born.
- Sure.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.170
- We've been trying for, like, six years.
- Sure.

09:34.342 --> 09:36.745
For a while there, it seemed like
the universe was against us.

09:36.746 --> 09:39.175
That's ridiculous. Why would
the universe be against one person?

09:40.477 --> 09:41.771
Here, have a spirit sticker!

09:41.777 --> 09:43.113
Don't be the only
student without one.

09:45.026 --> 09:46.448
I actually go to this school!

09:47.912 --> 09:49.792
Wow, you really
are invisible, huh?

09:50.112 --> 09:51.652
I could not be more fine with it.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.321
You're like that guy
from that movie

09:53.322 --> 09:54.548
who wishes he was never born.

09:55.192 --> 09:56.200
"It's a wonderful life."

09:56.550 --> 09:58.064
You say that, but do you mean it?

09:58.677 --> 10:00.819
Beautiful day here
at Red Stagg field.

10:00.820 --> 10:04.302
Kicking off for the home team
is number 44, Jason Miller,

10:04.303 --> 10:08.526
who also plays lacrosse,
soccer, and all the girl parts

10:08.527 --> 10:10.830
when he and his friends
act out "High School Musical."

10:10.997 --> 10:13.219
Quite possibly the only
girl parts he'll ever see.

10:16.008 --> 10:16.838
Haley!

10:17.103 --> 10:18.470
Hey, Dylan!

10:18.679 --> 10:20.039
I didn't realize
you were coming here.

10:20.247 --> 10:21.130
Are you kidding?

10:21.191 --> 10:22.545
This place was
like a home to me.

10:22.751 --> 10:24.167
It's like I was homeschooled.

10:24.377 --> 10:25.883
But I wasn't.
I was school-schooled.

10:26.344 --> 10:27.185
Were you?

10:27.971 --> 10:29.971
I got six kinds of pills
in my pocket,

10:29.972 --> 10:33.516
but this here, all this,
this is the best medicine.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.320
Aw, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

10:36.763 --> 10:37.872
So, Charlie, I --

10:42.574 --> 10:43.750
I'm here to get Lily.

10:43.842 --> 10:46.317
Oh, before I call her,
we had a small issue today.

10:46.598 --> 10:48.993
One of the boys, Patrick,
said Lily pushed him down

10:48.994 --> 10:50.436
and tried to kiss him.

10:50.461 --> 10:52.221
No, that doesn't sound like Lily.

10:52.222 --> 10:54.475
She was probably imitating
something she saw

10:54.476 --> 10:55.819
on TV or in her family --

10:55.820 --> 10:57.317
Ay, it was the TV, yes.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.015
Oh, but here she is.
She's always so sweet.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.206
Bye, Patrick.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.274
You see?
They're just friends.

11:04.879 --> 11:06.465
What are you laughing at, Evan?

11:06.466 --> 11:07.620
You're next.

11:09.113 --> 11:11.197
Okay, I'm going to talk
to her for a little bit.

11:13.472 --> 11:16.334
Oh, did I ever tell you that
I put your name up here?

11:17.233 --> 11:18.088
Huh?

11:18.327 --> 11:19.740
"Haley Dunphy dome."

11:19.966 --> 11:21.976
Aww, you named our special spot?

11:22.080 --> 11:24.602
Actually it was supposed
to be "Haley Dunphy, do me."

11:25.223 --> 11:26.543
I'm bad with spacing.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.080
Oh, you're not so bad.

11:30.238 --> 11:33.410
And that's halftime --
Panthers 6, Dolphins 0.

11:33.601 --> 11:35.382
That zero score by Jason Miller,

11:35.527 --> 11:37.207
who proudly prances off the field.

11:37.801 --> 11:39.325
Just let me go up there
and kick that kid's butt.

11:39.326 --> 11:41.507
Knock it off, Miller.
I need your leg. Take a knee.

11:42.386 --> 11:44.610
Now, I don't know what
tuna net you dolphins swam into,

11:44.611 --> 11:46.390
but you are drowning out there!

11:47.391 --> 11:49.841
Coach, would it really be
such a bad thing if we lost?

11:49.847 --> 11:51.940
- Beg your pardon?
- Look at them, coach.

11:51.964 --> 11:53.482
Haven't they lost enough already?

11:53.636 --> 11:54.877
Maybe giving them a win would,

11:54.878 --> 11:56.560
in a way, be a victory for us, too.

11:56.561 --> 11:58.010
Okay, you know what mattered
the most to Coach Knight?

11:58.011 --> 11:59.355
His work with special-needs kids?

11:59.356 --> 12:01.497
Okay, he took one kid
to one beach one time.

12:01.676 --> 12:02.505
Football!

12:02.694 --> 12:03.881
Football is what mattered the most!

12:03.882 --> 12:05.601
He lived for competition!

12:05.810 --> 12:09.321
He believed in sportsmanship,
integrity!

12:09.822 --> 12:12.179
Okay? Now, the way I see it,
we can roll over

12:12.424 --> 12:14.791
and give them an empty,
meaningless victory

12:14.792 --> 12:16.204
that he... would hate.

12:16.544 --> 12:19.540
Or we can go out there,
leave it all on the field,

12:21.300 --> 12:23.901
and be a team
he would be proud to lose to.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.214
Now, is this an "I" activity
or a "we" activity?!

12:27.444 --> 12:28.402
- We!
- What?!

12:28.403 --> 12:29.236
- We!
- What?!

12:29.237 --> 12:31.588
- We! We! We! We! We! We!
- That's right!

12:31.738 --> 12:33.365
Now you sound like dolphins!

12:35.254 --> 12:36.159
Hey, Tim!

12:36.599 --> 12:38.521
I got the next three days
of delivery slips

12:38.522 --> 12:40.025
for you here, signed, huh?

12:40.235 --> 12:41.494
- Thanks, Claire.
- Yeah.

12:41.835 --> 12:42.836
Signed those up good, huh?

12:42.837 --> 12:43.735
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.899
Yeah. Thanks.

12:45.074 --> 12:48.029
So, this is -- this is the,
uh, the regency birch?

12:48.030 --> 12:49.826
Beautiful model. Gorgeous.

12:49.827 --> 12:51.922
- You guys do such good work down here.
- Mm-hmm.

12:52.978 --> 12:54.913
Really, you mind
if I take her for a spin

12:54.914 --> 12:56.069
before she goes up
to the showroom?

12:56.156 --> 12:58.249
- You're the boss... ...
- 'S daughter.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.150
Mm-hmm.
That's what you want to say.

13:00.398 --> 13:04.081
Oh, okay. So, no mirror when
they're shipping, which makes sense.

13:06.033 --> 13:09.280
Also have, uh...
no handles.

13:10.391 --> 13:11.569
Hey -- hey, Tim?

13:13.785 --> 13:15.482
Hey, Tim!

13:16.907 --> 13:18.006
Tim!

13:19.198 --> 13:21.128
Oh, God.
Yeah, hi, dad.

13:21.390 --> 13:22.338
Hey, co-worker.

13:22.557 --> 13:24.282
Just seeing when you want
to leave for the game.

13:24.283 --> 13:27.014
- We're late already.
- Soon, soon.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.036
I'm -- I'm just --
I'm finishing up

13:30.037 --> 13:31.378
a little paperwork in my office.

13:31.670 --> 13:34.146
Okay. Let me know
if you need any help.

13:34.322 --> 13:35.414
No, I do not need your help.

13:35.415 --> 13:39.293
And as I believe I mentioned,
I would appreciate it

13:39.451 --> 13:43.061
if you were not constantly
looking over my shoulder.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.145
Come on. Give me some credit.

13:44.146 --> 13:45.744
That's the last thing I would do.

13:45.847 --> 13:49.328
Dad, you seem to forget
that I raised three children,

13:49.622 --> 13:52.888
and I had a career before this.

13:53.084 --> 13:55.951
I have done plenty of stuff
that does not -- Oh!

13:58.862 --> 13:59.775
Do you hear that?

13:59.865 --> 14:01.944
Sounds like it's coming
from the warehouse.

14:02.022 --> 14:03.570
Yeah, what even is that?

14:05.545 --> 14:06.873
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

14:07.571 --> 14:10.481
Uh, one piece of advice --
take it or leave it.

14:11.881 --> 14:12.757
What?

14:12.844 --> 14:15.531
The latch is under
the panel on the right.

14:24.933 --> 14:26.848
I got you mustard and Sauerkraut,
just what you like.

14:27.484 --> 14:28.798
You're being awfully nice,

14:29.234 --> 14:32.022
considering I started
that whole closet-nado.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.298
Well, you're still my daughter.

14:33.299 --> 14:35.022
It's okay I call you
that here, right?

14:35.023 --> 14:35.910
Yeah.

14:36.189 --> 14:38.643
Listen, it's hard for me to treat you
like everyone else.

14:39.493 --> 14:41.779
You're the only one
I carried home in my arms --

14:41.978 --> 14:44.608
except Dontrell,
last year's Christmas party.

14:44.609 --> 14:47.040
I pretty much poured him
through his sunroof.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.673
But I'll try.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.043
Thanks, dad.

14:50.044 --> 14:51.354
You got plans this weekend?

14:51.409 --> 14:52.528
- No. Not really. Why?
- Good.

14:53.047 --> 14:54.755
Be at the warehouse,
8:00 tomorrow.

14:54.756 --> 14:55.972
Wear something
you don't care about.

14:56.566 --> 14:57.411
Hey, guys.

14:57.617 --> 14:58.227
Hi, honey.

14:58.228 --> 14:59.326
What'd I miss?

14:59.786 --> 15:00.496
Nothing good.

15:00.497 --> 15:02.545
We're down by 6
with 3 minutes to play.

15:02.546 --> 15:04.160
Well, they could still
turn it around.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.086
Show's not over till the fat --
mama!

15:07.067 --> 15:10.050
Sensational punt by Miller,
who hasn't kicked that high

15:10.051 --> 15:11.349
since he broke the gender barrier

15:11.350 --> 15:13.411
and joined our own
modern dance troupe.

15:13.439 --> 15:15.003
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah!

15:15.019 --> 15:17.149
It's all about keeping
an attitive positude.

15:17.285 --> 15:19.390
Positude attitive.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.606
Hey, we should see a midnight
movie tonight, like old times.

15:24.607 --> 15:26.322
Oh, my God. I am so in!

15:26.594 --> 15:27.540
Cool. Cool.

15:27.571 --> 15:29.795
I'll come by your house
around 11:30 with the ladder?

15:29.796 --> 15:32.118
I don't need to climb
out of my window anymore, Dylan.

15:32.916 --> 15:36.031
Oh, ooh. Can we do it earlier?
I have a midterm tomorrow.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.362
Oh, I can't do earlier.

15:37.433 --> 15:39.830
I've got to meet up with some
classmates from nursing school.

15:40.145 --> 15:41.320
You're gonna be a nurse?

15:41.540 --> 15:43.893
Yeah, I figured it was
a natural next step.

15:44.021 --> 15:45.894
I've always healed people
with my music,

15:45.895 --> 15:48.222
and now I'm just doing
the same thing with drugs.

15:48.576 --> 15:50.819
Wow.
Well, ye-- another time, then.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.527
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:55.010 --> 15:56.689
Hey, if everything goes well,

15:56.690 --> 15:58.439
maybe one day
I'll see you in the hospital.

15:59.080 --> 15:59.873
I'd like that.

16:01.148 --> 16:02.360
So, I finally
get out of the closet,

16:02.361 --> 16:04.311
and there's dad
looking down at me.

16:04.623 --> 16:05.412
Been there.

16:05.867 --> 16:06.791
The whole daddy thing, though,

16:06.792 --> 16:08.158
it's really one
of your bigger issues.

16:08.659 --> 16:10.968
At least my daddy issues
are with my actual daddy.

16:10.969 --> 16:14.425
I don't run around making every
authority figure I meet into a father.

16:14.426 --> 16:15.306
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.406
W-what's that supposed to mean?

16:16.610 --> 16:17.865
Mitchell, come on.

16:17.866 --> 16:19.585
Why have you
not quit your job yet?

16:19.586 --> 16:20.846
His girlfriend
just broke up with him.

16:21.430 --> 16:22.740
Yeah, and what was your excuse last week?

16:22.741 --> 16:23.416
I had a cold.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.175
And the week before?

16:24.191 --> 16:25.242
I felt a cold coming on.

16:25.632 --> 16:29.779
Mitchell, this fell
out of your jacket.

16:30.639 --> 16:31.394
Care to explain?

16:31.395 --> 16:33.364
I was holding it for a friend.

16:36.159 --> 16:37.021
You want to quit?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.583
Charlie, you're --
you're a great boss,

16:39.584 --> 16:41.088
but I ju--
I got this other offer,

16:41.089 --> 16:42.889
and I just really miss
the courtroom.

16:43.966 --> 16:45.761
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you,

16:45.762 --> 16:48.010
you're... really letting me down.

16:49.252 --> 16:50.829
I just expected
so much more out of you.

16:50.830 --> 16:52.827
- Ohh.
- You were my favorite.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.434
Ohh, God.

16:54.435 --> 16:57.648
Um, well, maybe I-I could
still do things on the weekends.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.642
No, no! Charlie,
I'm -- I'm sorry.

17:00.727 --> 17:02.491
I -- I'm done.

17:03.543 --> 17:04.307
You know what?

17:05.215 --> 17:06.094
I don't blame you.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.345
I have to get back
on solid ground.

17:09.102 --> 17:10.810
- We both do.
- Well, I do more.

17:11.209 --> 17:12.152
My house is a boat.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.384
You made me in trouble.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.666
I didn't tell you to sit
on a boy until he liked you.

17:17.684 --> 17:18.895
- Yes-huh.
- Nuh-huh.

17:18.987 --> 17:20.294
We're not doing this again.

17:22.781 --> 17:24.083
Home team calls time-out.

17:24.365 --> 17:26.333
12 seconds left,
they're down by 6,

17:26.414 --> 17:28.269
and unable to shake
the Miller curse.

17:28.722 --> 17:29.620
That's it!

17:31.277 --> 17:32.503
Okay, boys, final play.

17:32.759 --> 17:33.922
Time for a little trickery.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.684
Oh, honey.
What happened to you today?

17:36.802 --> 17:38.101
A cosmic pummeling.

17:39.069 --> 17:40.149
I lost the deal.

17:40.528 --> 17:41.381
If I don't close on one tomorrow,

17:41.382 --> 17:43.632
it's gonna be my first month
ever with no sale.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.734
Actually, there is
no 31st this month.

17:46.017 --> 17:47.060
What are you talking about?

17:47.061 --> 17:50.181
Tomorrow's the first.
Honey, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

17:50.303 --> 17:51.089
No, I'm not okay!

17:51.090 --> 17:52.889
I just found out there is
literally no tomorrow!

17:54.700 --> 17:55.974
You know, I always say
if you wait long enough,

17:55.975 --> 17:56.923
your luck will change?

17:57.285 --> 17:58.560
Turns out that's just
a big pile of c--

17:58.561 --> 17:59.906
Hold on to your hats, folks.

18:00.653 --> 18:04.264
Are they? They are!
It's the triple gull-wing!

18:04.298 --> 18:05.366
That's my play!

18:05.423 --> 18:07.873
Woodson fakes right,
he fakes right again,

18:08.053 --> 18:10.509
he fakes faking right,
and he scores!

18:10.510 --> 18:12.186
They scored on my play!

18:12.751 --> 18:14.985
- Mitchell says you can sell me a house.
- Yes, I can!

18:15.003 --> 18:17.330
- Good call, Phil. Was that your play?!
- Yes, it was!

18:17.490 --> 18:18.752
You're being too rough, Lily.

18:18.753 --> 18:22.427
You cannot just see a guy and, mwah!,
kiss him like that, okay?

18:22.428 --> 18:24.228
Yes, you can!
Yes, you can!

18:25.308 --> 18:27.502
Okay! Okay! Miller's out.
Manny, you're my backup kicker.

18:27.503 --> 18:28.598
I need you to go out
there and nail this.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.814
Although if I miss it,
wouldn't a tie be a perfect way to --

18:30.842 --> 18:31.703
Manny, enough!

18:32.095 --> 18:33.791
You are not gonna
take away my victory!

18:35.006 --> 18:37.364
I mean --
I mean, your victory.

18:37.900 --> 18:38.549
Okay?

18:39.315 --> 18:40.861
Manny, I'm sorry.
I should not have yelled at you.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.949
You can go out there and
do whatever feels right.

18:43.198 --> 18:44.939
Okay? I support you
no matter what.

18:49.626 --> 18:52.966
32! Hut! Hut! Hike!

19:02.048 --> 19:04.501
I won! I won!
I mean, we won!

19:04.810 --> 19:05.896
We won! We won!

19:07.160 --> 19:08.546
Ooph! Sorry, ma'am.

19:08.677 --> 19:10.338
Ma'am? I sit next
to you in English.

19:10.356 --> 19:12.144
Hey, I think I dropped my phone
under the bleachers.

19:12.145 --> 19:12.896
Come get it with me?

19:14.519 --> 19:15.338
Found it.

19:15.516 --> 19:17.812
Great, and world order is restored.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.912
- Can we go home now?
- Yeah. Okay.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.341
Oh, hey, what's that?

19:23.024 --> 19:24.904
"Alex Dunphy dome?"

19:25.236 --> 19:27.844
Uh, I think it says
"Alex Dunphy, do me."

19:27.992 --> 19:29.868
Ugh, who would write
something like that?

19:30.106 --> 19:30.914
No idea.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.313
Hey, you want me
to scratch it out?

19:33.440 --> 19:36.306
No! I mean, pfft,
too late now.

19:36.535 --> 19:37.691
If it's out there,
it's out there.

19:40.545 --> 19:41.338
Hey, champ.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.309
Aren't you gonna go
celebrate with your team?

19:44.367 --> 19:45.535
Yeah, in a minute.

19:51.864 --> 19:53.356
You meant to miss the kick,
didn't you?

19:53.394 --> 19:54.107
I blew it.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.823
I could miss that kick
nine out of ten times.

19:57.471 --> 19:58.971
Why couldn't I miss it
when it counted?

20:01.046 --> 20:02.019
Let me ask you something.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.806
That ball sails
through the uprights,

20:05.406 --> 20:06.978
your team carries you
off the field.

20:08.095 --> 20:08.994
How does that feel?

20:10.910 --> 20:12.681
- Come on.
- Good.

20:12.899 --> 20:15.009
It's fun being part of a team.

20:15.185 --> 20:16.972
And it's really fun
being the hero.

20:17.287 --> 20:20.517
So I think you made
that kick on purpose.

20:21.143 --> 20:21.935
And listen.

20:22.582 --> 20:23.951
I don't think you're willing
to admit it yet,

20:23.952 --> 20:25.785
but somewhere underneath
all that humanity,

20:25.786 --> 20:27.130
there's a competitor -- sorry.

20:27.357 --> 20:29.211
There's a competitor,
and, Manny,

20:29.212 --> 20:30.855
there's nothing wrong with that.

20:31.548 --> 20:32.390
Nothing.

20:34.544 --> 20:35.321
Thanks, coach.

20:36.131 --> 20:37.142
You want to go eat some pizza?

20:37.455 --> 20:38.353
- Sure.
- Me, too.

20:40.966 --> 20:43.454
Hey, you think someday they might
name this field after you?

20:43.455 --> 20:44.507
Well, you're not the first person

20:44.508 --> 20:45.599
to think along those lines.

20:45.872 --> 20:47.846
Earlier today, someone
in the faculty bathroom

20:47.847 --> 20:50.056
was messing around with the phrase
"Cameron Tucker dome."

20:53.538 --> 20:55.476
Just sold the most
expensive house in town,

20:55.477 --> 20:57.358
sight unseen, all cash.

20:57.383 --> 20:59.013
- How 'bout that?
- I'm proud of you, dad.

20:59.932 --> 21:01.680
Pretty great day
for all the Dunphys.

21:01.883 --> 21:04.837
And then I said,
"Michelle, do you honestly believe

21:04.838 --> 21:06.350
every stupid rumor you hear?"

21:07.313 --> 21:08.123
Oh, you haven't heard?

21:08.292 --> 21:11.006
Well, apparently,
one of my exes is just, like...

21:11.028 --> 21:12.950
Tim, I -- I am so sorry
that you got hurt,

21:12.951 --> 21:13.950
and I will get
to the bottom of it,

21:13.951 --> 21:16.397
but I suspect it was sabotage
by the competition,

21:17.183 --> 21:19.393
maybe Closets, Closets,
Closets, Closets.

21:19.767 --> 21:22.380
Not too bad, a little puffy,
kind of like your eyes were

21:22.381 --> 21:24.037
when you saw
"Finding Nemo," Miller.

21:25.264 --> 21:27.984
Like I said -- positive attitude.
