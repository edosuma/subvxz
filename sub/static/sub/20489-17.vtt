00:10.410 --> 00:11.611
The guy's name is adam.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.613
And you're going to
listen to what he has to say.

00:13.648 --> 00:15.615
This is a waste of time.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.582
No, it's not.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.219
My mother told
me all about him.

00:19.254 --> 00:20.785
He can help you.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.022
Mutant x is for real.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.989
Are you expecting me
to just go run and hide?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.226
Adam protects
new mutants like you
by bringing them to the

00:26.261 --> 00:28.428
underground where those
government goons can't find you.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.830
I can
take care of myself.

00:30.865 --> 00:31.997
Okay.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.034
And, i'm not about to
trust some guy i don't know.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.600
Marc, please.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.637
Just listen
to what he has to say.

00:37.672 --> 00:38.655
Sorry, babe.

00:38.690 --> 00:39.639
I'm outta here.

00:40.040 --> 00:40.840
No, no. No, no.
Please. Please.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.442
Please megan, let go of me.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.660
You can't leave.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.844
I said, let go.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.463
Megan.

00:46.498 --> 00:48.274
Marc.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.050
Megan!

01:15.275 --> 01:18.043
What happened?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.480
What's wrong with her?

01:23.683 --> 01:26.086
She's dead.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.494
This is all your fault!

03:09.923 --> 03:11.890
What are you doing?

03:11.925 --> 03:14.327
Sizing you up for the kill.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.493
What's up?

03:15.528 --> 03:17.130
Looking for your weak point.

03:17.165 --> 03:18.731
What weak point?

03:31.945 --> 03:33.947
It is far
too early to be exerting
that kind of energy, shal.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.513
It's not normal.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.951
Looks like somebody
needs a cup of coffee.

03:37.986 --> 03:39.552
You better
make it a pot.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.755
Hey. Has anyone seen adam?

03:42.790 --> 03:43.556
No, emma.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.158
He must have come
home pretty late last night.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.376
Didn't hear him come in.

03:46.411 --> 03:47.525
Maybe he's still asleep.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.127
Or maybe he just
didn't make it home at all.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.564
Come on,
even geniuses need to get their
groove on once in a while.

03:51.599 --> 03:55.168
Well, i was supposed to meet
him in the lab half an hour ago

03:55.203 --> 03:57.170
for an edd check.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.137
He missed a check-up?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.574
That doesn't
sound like adam.

04:40.813 --> 04:44.817
Get away from her.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.636
Murderer.

04:46.671 --> 04:48.386
What?

04:48.421 --> 04:50.023
You killed her.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.396
It's not possible.

04:58.431 --> 05:05.638
I loved her and you
took her away from me.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.605
Who are you?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.642
Why can't i remember
what happened?

05:10.043 --> 05:13.246
Because...
you hit your head when
i pulled you off of her.

05:13.281 --> 05:16.849
No. My head doesn't hurt.

05:16.884 --> 05:22.020
It's just... empty.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.258
You tell it to the cops.

05:25.293 --> 05:27.660
I didn't kill her.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.264
Well,
that's going to be a hard
sell with me as an eyewitness.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.448
Yeah, right.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.485
You're no killer.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.710
This is our quarry.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.714
He has the ability
to absorb a person's memory
with his powerful gaze.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.681
Precisely.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.884
Four of my best agents
have failed to capture him.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.722
By the time they apprehend him,
they quite literally forget

06:30.123 --> 06:32.925
why they were ever
there in the first place.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.293
That's about to change.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.131
Well, i'm glad
to hear you say that.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.498
His power's in his eyes.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.136
However, your second eyelid
should serve as your protection.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.740
He won't know
which end is up when
i'm through with him.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.949
Could you do that again?

07:02.555 --> 07:04.922
Adam?

07:04.957 --> 07:06.959
Adam, can you hear me?

07:12.965 --> 07:14.167
Adam, i know you're there.

07:14.202 --> 07:15.786
Please answer me.

07:15.821 --> 07:17.335
Okay, that's it.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.936
I'm officially worried.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.773
Why wouldn't
he answer his comlink?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.575
Who was the
last one to see him?

07:22.975 --> 07:24.177
I was.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.179
He got a call from someone
named megan alexander.

07:26.214 --> 07:28.581
She's not a new mutant
but her boyfriend is.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.784
Adam went to meet with them
to try to convince her boyfriend

07:31.819 --> 07:32.950
to go into the underground.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.987
Any idea where
they were meeting?

07:35.022 --> 07:36.554
The loading dock on the pier.

07:36.589 --> 07:37.755
Well. I'm going
to go over there.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.592
Maybe i can pick up
a telempathic hit there.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.394
So have you tried hooking
into adam from here?

07:41.794 --> 07:43.796
Yeah, but it was weird.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.598
All i got was a blank.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.999
What does that mean?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.201
I don't know.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.402
It could mean nothing.

07:49.802 --> 07:50.603
He could be unconscious.

07:51.003 --> 07:52.205
For fourteen hours?

07:52.605 --> 07:54.972
Well, his comlink's active.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.809
At least we
know he's still alive.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.611
Right.
He's out there somewhere.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.178
He's just not responding.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.814
Why don't i try
tracking his signal, huh?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.015
See where he is.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.219
If he's not going to
come to us, we'll go to him.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.632
Jesse, i think something's
happened to adam.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.200
The entire warehouse
is swarming with police.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.239
You don't think that he could
still be in there, do you?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.243
Adam?

08:31.444 --> 08:33.010
No, no. No way.

08:33.044 --> 08:34.611
He's miles away
from the warehouse.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.614
I was able to get a fix off
the signal from his comlink.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.051
Brennan and
shalimar are on their way
over to pick him up now.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.456
Well, then who...?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.073
All right, jess.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.075
We're here at 16th
and market, and adam's
nowhere to be found.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.242
No, he's got to be there.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.478
I'm been staring at this
signal for five minutes.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.679
It hasn't moved.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.281
You sure you're looking
at the right map, jess?

09:08.681 --> 09:09.682
He's not here.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.648
Nah, come on.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.285
He should be
right in front of you.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.494
He's not, but his ring is.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.662
You can't get a
signal from his ring.

09:24.697 --> 09:27.900
His com link
won't work unless it's
activated by his dna.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.902
It's covered in his dna.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.904
Blood.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.129
Marc griffin.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.148
My name's lena.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.133
We need to talk.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.135
Get out of my way...

10:03.536 --> 10:05.503
argh.

10:05.538 --> 10:10.708
I don't handle
rejection very well.

10:10.743 --> 10:14.747
Bet you think
a girl could just get lost
in those eyes of yours, huh?

10:17.149 --> 10:18.751
Guess again.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.320
Argh.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.156
I can't see.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.958
Relax, honey.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.960
It'll eventually
wear off.

10:31.964 --> 10:32.765
Who's there?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.583
C'mon.

10:33.618 --> 10:34.367
No.

10:34.767 --> 10:35.533
Come on!

10:35.568 --> 10:36.769
I need your help.

10:37.169 --> 10:37.935
Let me guess.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.371
You don't
know where to hide.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.773
Yeah.
Something like that.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.574
I know a place.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.777
Good. So we got the
blind leading the stupid.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.379
Why would adam
take off his ring?

10:46.414 --> 10:47.945
It doesn't
make sense.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.982
It's got to somehow be
connected to megan's murder.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.584
Maybe adam was a witness.

10:51.984 --> 10:52.785
Hey, guys...

10:53.185 --> 10:54.352
you're not going
to believe this.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.389
The police have released
an artist's rendering of the

10:56.424 --> 10:58.391
suspect in the murder
of megan alexander.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.393
Check it out.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.713
Is this your idea of joke?

11:21.113 --> 11:22.680
What? - Cops?

11:22.715 --> 11:24.682
You trying to set me up?

11:24.717 --> 11:26.719
This is megan's place
and i thought we'd be safe.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.320
Come on.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.733
How are your eyes?

11:40.768 --> 11:43.135
Still blurry.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.108
Why did you
save me back there?

11:51.143 --> 11:52.745
'Cause i needed some help in
finding out who i am and you're

11:52.780 --> 11:54.764
the only person i know.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.714
Why would i help you.

11:56.749 --> 11:57.950
You killed
my girlfriend.

11:58.350 --> 11:59.751
I don't believe
that for a second.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.270
And i don't
think you do either.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.720
You don't know
what i think.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.558
Look,
last night i broke into a
doctor's office and did a

12:05.958 --> 12:08.360
little research
on my condition.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.161
Amnesia.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.327
Yeah.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.329
It's either retrograde,
post-hypnotic or

12:12.364 --> 12:14.732
emotional-hysterical
usually cause by trauma.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.169
And i've ruled out injury
'cause i know you lied to me

12:17.204 --> 12:19.136
about hitting my head.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.974
I also found out that memory
loss is usually treated by

12:22.009 --> 12:24.777
sodium
amybarbital or thiopentol,
which unfortunately for

12:24.812 --> 12:27.197
you did nothing
to alleviate my condition.

12:27.232 --> 12:29.547
So now i want you
to tell me what's going on.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.349
You sure don't sound like
a guy with amnesia to me.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.752
No,
because my ability to store
short-term memory hasn't been

12:34.787 --> 12:37.590
affected
and i seem to have a natural
affinity for learning things.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.957
So, you're an
intelligent murderer.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.394
So,
if i killed megan, what were
you doing holding the gun?

12:42.795 --> 12:45.963
I had to fight to
get it away from you.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.400
No,
because i remember that
the fight happened after

12:48.801 --> 12:50.402
i woke up and you
were holding the gun.

12:50.437 --> 12:54.772
So, you're a liar.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.010
And not a very good one.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.176
Go to hell!

12:59.211 --> 13:03.215
I'm not going anywhere
until i get some answers.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.026
Adam a fugitive from justice.

13:14.426 --> 13:18.430
Of course it's what i've
been calling him all along.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.434
Why would adam protect
the man accusing him of murder?

13:22.469 --> 13:25.638
Maybe adam
thinks he's innocent.

13:26.038 --> 13:31.208
Or maybe, adam doesn't
know what to think.

13:31.243 --> 13:37.649
What if this griffin character
stole adam's memories and has

13:37.684 --> 13:44.056
them sitting in his brain
just waiting to be discovered?

13:44.091 --> 13:48.861
Capture griffin,
and we've got adam as well.

13:50.863 --> 13:53.666
Shalimar, none of us
even want to consider this,

13:54.066 --> 13:56.433
but has it crossed your
mind that we might be wrong?

13:56.468 --> 14:00.472
I mean, what if adam
is somehow responsible
for megan's murder?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.875
What?

14:03.275 --> 14:07.680
Listen, we both know
adam's not capable of murder.

14:07.715 --> 14:10.447
Yeah, right.

14:10.482 --> 14:14.086
Wish i knew what
i was looking for,

14:14.121 --> 14:16.906
never mind
how to find it.

14:16.941 --> 14:19.692
That's why
you're with me.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.069
What?

14:32.104 --> 14:34.506
Well,
adam was definitely here.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.705
What?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.542
This is adam's blood.

15:24.156 --> 15:28.125
This isn't.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.162
I bet if we run
this dna sample through
the database we'll

15:30.197 --> 15:32.164
find a piece to our puzzle.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.133
Okay.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.570
You want to
know the truth?

15:38.971 --> 15:42.174
I don't know for
sure it was you.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.942
Then why would
you accuse me?

15:44.977 --> 15:48.580
When i came in,
she was dead and you
were standing over her.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.983
But what
was i doing there?

15:51.018 --> 15:52.985
I mean,
obviously you knew me.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.551
She did.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.354
I was in danger.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.991
Look, she told
me that there's this
group out there.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.194
They call themselves
mutant x. And then
there's this other

16:02.229 --> 16:04.962
rogue government
organization.

16:04.997 --> 16:09.401
Well, my guess is one
of them did something
to mess with your head.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.405
And they set
you up for murder.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.608
No. You're lying.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.175
See, no...

16:18.210 --> 16:20.612
see, you're lying, but you're
mixing in enough of the truth

16:20.647 --> 16:22.179
to confuse to the issue.

16:22.214 --> 16:23.415
You're pointing
a gun at me.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.634
What do you
want me to say?

16:24.669 --> 16:25.818
I want you
to keep talking.

16:25.853 --> 16:26.618
Why? Why?

16:27.019 --> 16:28.220
Whatever i
say, you just...

16:28.255 --> 16:29.421
you pick and choose

16:29.822 --> 16:31.023
until you
find something that
you want to believe.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.425
Well,
because i weigh what you
say against what i know.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.844
I'm done with
the cross-examination.

16:34.879 --> 16:36.228
You want to shoot
me? Go right ahead.

16:36.628 --> 16:37.429
But i'm walking out
of here right now.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.431
Hey, hey,
hey, griffin!

16:49.041 --> 16:51.443
Okay. Please.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.646
You want to
know who you are?

16:54.681 --> 16:58.650
Turn yourself in.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.660
Griffin.

17:10.662 --> 17:11.864
Griffin!

17:15.067 --> 17:16.667
Griffin!

17:19.070 --> 17:20.672
Griffin!

17:21.874 --> 17:23.840
Adam!

17:23.876 --> 17:26.242
Thank god you're alive.

17:26.278 --> 17:27.479
Man,
are we glad to see you.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.081
Are you...?

17:29.481 --> 17:31.048
You know me?

17:31.083 --> 17:32.884
Yeah. Of course we do.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.803
What did
you call me?

17:34.838 --> 17:36.688
You don't
recognize us?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.300
I don't know what's
going on in his head.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.129
Hello again.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.334
Don't bother
running, griffin.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.340
Let's get him, guys.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.754
Okay. Let's
get out of here.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.122
Adam. Wait.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.159
Where you going?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.132
Hey.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.169
Easy. Easy. Easy.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.374
I think this is our guy.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.376
Get on the radio.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.086
Congratulations,
miss blake.

19:16.121 --> 19:18.123
I can see my confidence in
you was not misplaced after all.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.125
I'd have delivered
adam, too, sir.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.692
But...

19:21.727 --> 19:26.131
i have a feeling that with mr
griffin here it will be almost

19:26.166 --> 19:28.551
like talking to adam himself.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.901
Isn't that so, mr griffin?

19:30.936 --> 19:33.338
We both know you pilfered
adam's consciousness.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.358
How else could
you frame him for murder?

19:36.393 --> 19:39.309
I didn't steal anyone's
memories, mason.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.147
And i didn't frame
anyone for murder, either.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.550
Then how did you
know my first name?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.163
Now perhaps we can have an
honest conversation now that

19:58.198 --> 20:01.767
we see eye to eye.

20:01.802 --> 20:04.535
You first.

20:04.570 --> 20:08.574
You killed your girlfriend
during a domestic squabble.

20:08.609 --> 20:11.341
Adam walks in.

20:11.376 --> 20:15.380
To eliminate him as a witness,
you steal his memories and

20:15.415 --> 20:18.801
set him up for the murder.

20:18.836 --> 20:22.152
Well isn't that a nice story.

20:22.187 --> 20:25.791
When do you
get to the part about me
living happily ever after?

20:29.795 --> 20:31.361
I simply don't understand,

20:31.396 --> 20:33.764
mr griffin,
why you are do resistant.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.801
There's a bright future
ahead of you at genomex.

20:35.836 --> 20:38.604
It's worth a
lot to you, huh?

20:39.004 --> 20:42.207
Money, position, power.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.575
It's all yours.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.412
If you have the
information that leads to the

20:47.447 --> 20:49.414
destruction of mutant x.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.188
Marc griffin.

20:58.223 --> 20:59.790
So it was megan's boyfriend.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.827
He's a psionic with
the ability to absorb memory.

21:02.227 --> 21:05.831
Well that explains why
adam didn't recognize us.

21:06.231 --> 21:09.835
Yeah,
and why he ran straight
into the arms of the police.

21:09.870 --> 21:12.202
Wait 'til i get
my hands on this guy.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.440
I'm going to leave him
with a few memories of my own.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.442
Wait a minute.

21:17.843 --> 21:21.046
If griffin can
absorb adam's memory,

21:21.081 --> 21:24.249
then he can absorb
all of his knowledge.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.251
He knows
about the safehouses.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.853
He knows the security codes.

21:27.888 --> 21:29.419
Sanctuary access.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.257
He knows where we live.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.665
What's that?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.232
Ow! Easy.

21:42.267 --> 21:46.672
All mr. Griffin has managed
to provide us with are a few

21:47.072 --> 21:49.474
safehouses and a few
mutant x contacts.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.441
What's the problem?

21:51.476 --> 21:53.443
He says it's too
much information.

21:53.478 --> 21:57.082
Half of what he spews out are
disjointed scientific equations.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.484
I see.

21:59.885 --> 22:02.688
Sadly, he has the memories
but lacks adam's superior

22:02.723 --> 22:04.690
intellect to process the data.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.657
Exactly.

22:06.692 --> 22:09.094
Griffin only possesses
half the equation.

22:09.129 --> 22:13.864
And adam possesses
the other half.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.502
And considering mr griffin
has wiped his slate clean,

22:17.537 --> 22:21.907
adam must have
no idea who to trust.

22:21.942 --> 22:23.473
Not at all.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.911
His world has
been quite literally
turned upside down.

22:25.946 --> 22:28.714
Well, then.

22:29.114 --> 22:34.319
Perhaps he'd be receptive to
a familiar face from the past.

22:46.331 --> 22:47.933
Adam.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.935
Thank god you're all right.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.302
Who are you?

22:52.337 --> 22:53.939
Well, they said
you had a memory lapse.

22:54.339 --> 22:57.542
I would never have
believed it if i hadn't
seen it with my own eyes.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.544
Adam?

22:59.945 --> 23:02.147
It's mason.

23:02.182 --> 23:04.314
Mason eckhart.

23:04.349 --> 23:08.753
Do you know what
happened to me?

23:08.788 --> 23:12.574
A band of
outlaws set you up.

23:12.609 --> 23:15.686
Deviant liars
the lot of them.

23:15.721 --> 23:18.243
They call
themselves mutant x.

23:18.278 --> 23:20.766
Griffin's one
of these mutants?

23:20.801 --> 23:22.332
Yes, i'm afraid so.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.770
Now doctors
are working feverishly to
assess what he did to you.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.371
So we can
reverse the process.

23:26.772 --> 23:27.973
Restore my memory?

23:28.008 --> 23:29.940
God willing.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.377
We desperately need you back,
adam, as soon as possible.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.543
Wait, wait, wait.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.545
You... you and
i work together?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.983
I keep forgetting
you're in the dark here.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.786
Those bastards!

23:41.186 --> 23:45.155
We work at genomex.

23:45.190 --> 23:52.397
A biotech firm,
which is actually a secret
branch of us intelligence.

23:52.798 --> 23:56.001
You're our chief biogeneticist.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.804
And this is why they're
trying to set me up?

23:58.839 --> 24:01.206
To discredit
genomex and myself.

24:01.241 --> 24:02.372
All right.

24:02.407 --> 24:03.608
This makes some sense.

24:03.643 --> 24:04.775
But now wait, wait.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.612
These mutants,
are their abilities the
result of natural evolution?

24:07.647 --> 24:09.179
Sadly, no.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.816
These anomalies are the
tragic results of genetic

24:11.216 --> 24:13.183
experimentations gone wrong.

24:13.218 --> 24:16.822
Our job is
to protect the world from
their freakish powers.

24:16.857 --> 24:19.189
What,
so you and i are trying
to cure these anomalies?

24:19.224 --> 24:23.628
Adam,
this isn't the place to discuss
these sensitive matters.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.595
Trust me.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.232
It'll all be clear when
we get you home to genomex.

24:27.267 --> 24:28.398
Wait!

24:28.433 --> 24:30.635
How can you prove to the
cops what really happened?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.838
And what makes you so
sure that i'm so innocent?

24:32.873 --> 24:34.404
Adam, please.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.041
We both know you'd never
be capable of something

24:36.076 --> 24:38.043
so barbarous as murder.

24:38.078 --> 24:40.410
Hey, time's up.

24:40.445 --> 24:44.049
Dig down into
your core to find the
inner strength you need

24:44.449 --> 24:46.817
in this time of struggle.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.418
I only ask
you remain patient.

24:48.453 --> 24:52.858
I'm pulling as
many strings as i can to
arrange for your release.

24:52.893 --> 24:55.878
Wait. Mason.

24:55.913 --> 24:58.864
Thank you.

25:06.471 --> 25:09.639
So,
tapped into the pd database,

25:09.674 --> 25:12.077
you'll never guess who just
paid adam a visit in jail.

25:12.477 --> 25:13.678
Who?

25:14.079 --> 25:15.645
Mason eckhart.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.282
Well,
that explains it.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.884
I did a little
tapping myself.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.251
He's being transferred to
a secret federal facility.

25:21.286 --> 25:24.089
I'll bet you eckhart
trying to reprogram
him to work for the gsa.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.892
He's crazy if he thinks
adam would ever agree to that.

25:26.927 --> 25:28.058
Oh, jess, come on.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.694
Adam doesn't
even know who
he is at this point.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.661
There's no telling
who he's going to trust.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.700
How are the
girls doing reprogramming
the security codes?

25:35.735 --> 25:37.702
I think they
got it covered.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.269
Why?

25:39.304 --> 25:40.906
What do you got planned?

25:41.306 --> 25:44.109
I think that we should
take adam for a little
stroll down memory lane.

25:44.509 --> 25:46.111
Come on.

26:07.732 --> 26:11.701
Adam, it's me.
It's jesse.

26:11.736 --> 26:15.340
You're one of
them, aren't you?

26:15.375 --> 26:16.907
Mutant x.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.543
Do you remember?

26:18.944 --> 26:20.110
No.

26:20.145 --> 26:22.547
My friend mason eckhart
told me all about you.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.114
You and your kind.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.151
Look, i don't know what line
he's laying down on you.

26:26.186 --> 26:28.954
But you are the
leader of mutant x.

26:28.989 --> 26:30.520
That's a lie.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.122
No. It's the truth.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.358
Okay,
and i can prove it.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.760
Look,
do you remember this?

26:35.795 --> 26:40.130
You designed it.

26:40.165 --> 26:42.567
It is keyed into
your personal dna.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.770
Look, you made
one for all of us.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.542
Guard!

26:52.577 --> 26:54.179
Adam, look at it!

26:54.214 --> 26:54.980
Guard!

26:55.380 --> 26:58.183
Look at it!

26:58.218 --> 27:00.951
Listen to him.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.753
He's telling the truth.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.591
Adam,
you got to believe us.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.394
You didn't
kill megan alexander.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.597
Megan alexander.

27:12.632 --> 27:15.365
I knew her mother.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.402
That's why i went to meet her.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.003
You remember?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.170
Well, yeah.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.607
For some reason
that part i do remember.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.434
Right.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.436
Get me out of here.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.440
Put these on.

28:14.092 --> 28:15.659
This is my home?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.696
You designed
it and built it
from the ground up.

28:17.731 --> 28:18.897
I designed this?

28:18.932 --> 28:20.498
Not bad.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.065
I'll say.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.667
How's it feel to be home?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.104
Like i say, it looks
familiar but i don't know.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.907
Somehow it feels right.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.117
Shalimar?

28:39.152 --> 28:40.836
Emma?

28:40.871 --> 28:42.520
Hello.

28:50.528 --> 28:54.532
So, is there a place
where i store all the
data that i've compiled?

28:54.933 --> 28:56.499
Of course,

28:56.534 --> 29:00.538
i can download
just about anything
in sanctuary from the lab.

29:00.939 --> 29:04.142
Maybe if i look over
some old notes it just
might jar some memories.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.314
He didn't recognize me.

29:11.349 --> 29:12.951
I couldn't
even begin to imagine
what that must be like.

29:12.986 --> 29:14.517
Not knowing anybody.

29:14.552 --> 29:17.756
Not knowing any places.
Just a blank slate.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.959
How long do
you think it'll be before
he's back to his old self?

29:20.994 --> 29:23.326
I don't know.

29:23.361 --> 29:26.965
But we'll
get him there.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.778
You know, adam,
if this will be easier
we can print it out

29:39.813 --> 29:40.979
in a hard copy for you.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.545
No, thanks.

29:42.580 --> 29:43.782
That won't be necessary.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.784
See if you can pull up any
files relating to mutations

29:45.819 --> 29:47.385
of the temporal lobe.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.551
Okay.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.188
Just give
me one sec.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.598
Can i give it a try?

30:00.633 --> 30:02.600
Sure.

30:13.411 --> 30:16.980
Looks like you're
a pretty fast learner.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.417
For some reason i seem to
be good at picking things up.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.384
You think?

30:21.419 --> 30:23.421
You think you're going to be
able to reverse this and get

30:23.456 --> 30:24.622
your memory back?

30:25.023 --> 30:26.189
In theory, yeah.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.226
But it's going to be
important to access the source.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.427
Griffin?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.994
Yeah.

30:31.029 --> 30:32.630
Since he's framing
me for murder,

30:32.665 --> 30:34.232
i have no illusions about his...

30:36.634 --> 30:39.838
adam?

30:49.047 --> 30:51.414
Now i'm going
to ask you a question.

30:51.449 --> 30:53.451
I just want you to
concentrate on the answer.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.455
The computer will decipher
the information by reading the

30:57.490 --> 30:59.457
neurotransmitters
in your brain.

30:59.492 --> 31:02.225
I'm ready.

31:02.260 --> 31:05.463
Mutant x is home base
- they call it sanctuary.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.866
Where is it located?

31:14.272 --> 31:17.075
Pointless.

31:17.475 --> 31:19.477
We just received
word from the prison.

31:19.512 --> 31:21.044
Adam's escaped.

31:21.079 --> 31:24.647
My day just
keeps getting better
by the minute.

31:24.682 --> 31:28.686
And from my
perspective, your shelf
life is just about up.

31:28.721 --> 31:29.888
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

31:30.288 --> 31:32.255
Let's not make any
rash decisions here.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.692
Rash was ever thinking that
you could be of value to me.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.912
But that's because you're
going about this all wrong.

31:36.947 --> 31:39.423
Just because i can't process
all the information i have,

31:39.458 --> 31:41.900
doesn't mean
that i can't access it
through other methods.

31:41.935 --> 31:43.501
You want
to go to sanctuary.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.104
I can
take you there.

31:46.139 --> 31:48.306
Like a bird to its nest.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.720
Here comes
adam's brain scan.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.088
Look at his temporal lobe.

32:05.123 --> 32:07.926
For some reason this red area
is indicating a sudden change

32:08.326 --> 32:10.328
of brainwave function.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.930
Got any idea why?

32:11.965 --> 32:14.697
Yeah, i do.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.299
Griffin's power.

32:16.334 --> 32:20.738
I think it's triggered a genetic
corrosion in my brain cells.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.740
You are supposed to
be resting over here.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.307
There's no time for that.

32:24.342 --> 32:30.348
By the looks of that scan,
it's degenerating exponentially.

32:30.748 --> 32:37.155
Is that what's
causing the blackouts?

32:37.555 --> 32:39.557
Does that happen a lot?

32:39.592 --> 32:41.176
Hey guys?

32:41.211 --> 32:42.725
Guys?

32:42.760 --> 32:43.927
What's going on?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.563
I thought you changed
the security codes?

32:45.598 --> 32:46.764
We did.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.331
What could be causing this?

32:48.366 --> 32:50.368
I don't know but i have to
activate the back-up systems and

32:50.403 --> 32:51.569
seal everything off now.

32:53.171 --> 32:54.372
I'm going to do a walk-through
to make sure everything's clear.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.374
Alright, i got you covered.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.780
Brennan.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.589
Brennan.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.613
You've made me a very
happy man, mr. Griffin.

33:43.654 --> 33:46.056
Hey, jess.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.459
Brennan?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.864
What the hell's going on here.

33:53.264 --> 33:55.666
I'm going to go check it out.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.668
You stay with adam.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.081
What is it?

34:11.117 --> 34:13.284
Griffin's here.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.251
Griffin?

34:15.286 --> 34:17.253
I thought you said
this place was secure?

34:17.288 --> 34:19.290
Well,
not to someone with your
memories, apparently.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.657
And he's not alone.

34:21.692 --> 34:25.295
Alright, so we got to find
them before they find us.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.503
Adam.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.710
I've always dreamt
that this day would come.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.277
That's the dojo.

34:41.312 --> 34:44.514
Adam created this for
a variety of functions,

34:44.550 --> 34:48.083
one of which
is a virtual prison.

34:48.119 --> 34:52.924
They're not going anywhere
- unless you want them to.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.326
What do you plan on
doing with this place?

34:55.726 --> 34:58.529
It will be
converted into a hidden
division of genomex.

34:58.564 --> 35:02.498
My pied a terre.

35:02.533 --> 35:07.738
Collect the others while i
explore the rest of my new home.

35:39.770 --> 35:42.939
Megan.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.177
Marc,
look what you've done.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.179
Baby, it was an accident.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.745
An accident?

35:49.780 --> 35:51.782
Then why did you tell
the police that it was adam?

35:52.183 --> 35:54.585
He was trying to help you.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.989
To help us.

35:58.024 --> 36:00.992
I was scared.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.397
I love you.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.164
I love you.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.002
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.603
You know that.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.406
If you really love me,
you'll do the right thing.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.231
Get out of my house.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.273
Have you out
in a minute, guys.

37:35.886 --> 37:37.853
I'm so sorry, baby.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.890
I'll do whatever it takes
to make things right.

37:47.498 --> 37:49.465
Where's megan?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.902
She's gone griffin.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.869
I'm a psionic.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.871
I was able to draw
megan from your mind.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.309
Look, i know that you
didn't mean to kill her.

37:58.709 --> 38:01.512
It was an accident.

38:01.912 --> 38:08.719
But it's time that
you set things right.

38:08.754 --> 38:12.340
You owe it to adam
- and to megan.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.926
I don't know if this
is going to work.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.729
It may be too late.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.331
You can do it.

38:20.731 --> 38:22.333
I know you can.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.956
My eyes. My eyes.

38:47.958 --> 38:50.361
I think it's
time for you to crawl
back into your rock.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.771
Shalimar, come on.

39:02.373 --> 39:03.974
Get to the lab!

39:04.009 --> 39:05.176
Go.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.598
Get down.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.407
Hey. Hey, you okay?

39:56.427 --> 39:58.829
What, you're just having
a little look around?

39:58.864 --> 40:01.197
Adam,
thank god you're all right.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.435
We've come to rescue
from these monsters and
take you back to genomex.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.437
No, i like it here.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.003
You're...

40:08.038 --> 40:09.240
back to my old self.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.443
Yeah, so why don't you do
yourself a little favour and get

40:12.843 --> 40:14.009
your ass out of my sanctuary?

40:14.044 --> 40:16.847
I don't think so, since i've
discovered your little hideout,

40:17.248 --> 40:19.650
your cloak of secrecy
is all but vanished.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.652
Let's face it, adam.

40:22.052 --> 40:23.654
It's over.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.062
Looks like it worked.

40:32.463 --> 40:33.629
Yeah.

40:33.664 --> 40:34.430
Are you all right?

40:34.465 --> 40:35.666
Yeah,
i'm never better.

40:36.066 --> 40:38.268
I guess that
explains the fire
back in your eyes.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.471
You have no idea how long
i've wanted to do that.

40:40.506 --> 40:41.672
Well, i don't
mind telling you,

40:42.072 --> 40:44.074
we were very
worried about you.

40:44.475 --> 40:46.041
Thanks.

40:46.076 --> 40:48.078
It's good to have you back.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.897
Good to be back.

40:49.932 --> 40:51.647
Yeah. Thanks.

40:51.682 --> 40:55.286
Griffin decided to go to
the police and tell the truth.

40:55.321 --> 40:59.290
I know i can never
make it up to you.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.692
But i want you
to know i'm sorry.

41:02.092 --> 41:05.696
Well,
i want you to know that we've
been working on a little

41:05.731 --> 41:09.300
antidote to counteract
the coma-like side-effects

41:09.335 --> 41:11.667
of your mutant ability.

41:11.702 --> 41:16.106
So there might
just be a way for you to
make it up to me after all.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.511
Excuse me.

41:20.546 --> 41:22.130
Excuse me.

41:22.165 --> 41:23.679
Excuse me.

41:23.714 --> 41:24.915
What did you
say your name was?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.517
Never mind.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.484
It's not
important now.

41:28.519 --> 41:32.122
Just tell me, what are
all these people doing here?

41:32.157 --> 41:34.525
I'm not
exactly sure, sir.

41:34.925 --> 41:38.929
Well, then, back to...

41:38.964 --> 41:42.933
where you were.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.746
I would
appreciate it if you would
tell me where my office is.
