01:17.840 --> 01:19.319
Don't move!

03:02.639 --> 03:04.560
They're looking for you all over,

03:05.840 --> 03:07.840
but your hideout's safe.

03:11.639 --> 03:13.919
It's not a hideout,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.080
it's a prison.

03:16.599 --> 03:19.439
And I locked myself in here
all on my own.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.919
If they haven't found me yet
it's only thanks to you, Mistral.

03:30.039 --> 03:31.919
I had a bad dream:

03:33.800 --> 03:36.599
hands, arms were reaching
outta the ground,

03:36.680 --> 03:39.800
they were grabbing at me
and I couldn't get free.

03:42.159 --> 03:44.039
The dead were returning.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.520
They were dragging me
underground with them.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.000
The dead don't return even in dreams.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.719
It's the living we gotta be scared of.

04:06.560 --> 04:13.439
GOMORRA

04:26.160 --> 04:28.120
Mrs Levante...

04:28.199 --> 04:29.279
Please, follow me.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.120
You confirm that you have no idea
who it could have been?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.680
Think carefully.

04:53.759 --> 04:56.480
Any news about
my brother Michelangelo?

04:59.879 --> 05:03.040
The police haven't found
any trace of him.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.079
We fear he and his wife
have ended up like your parents.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.639
Have faith in the justice system.

05:13.319 --> 05:16.240
My brother doesn't even have
a grave to put a flower on.

05:16.319 --> 05:19.199
You can't deny us the comfort
of a grave for Mamma and Papa.

05:19.879 --> 05:22.800
You've kept them locked
in there for ten days.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.759
When can we give them a decent burial?

05:25.839 --> 05:28.759
It's not possible in Naples,
you know that.

05:29.519 --> 05:31.759
We just want to bury them in peace.

05:31.839 --> 05:33.879
Put an end to it.

05:35.079 --> 05:37.360
The only vengeance is justice.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Justice is in the hands of God
and we've always trusted him.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.439
Did you behave?

06:11.319 --> 06:15.279
I did what the women in our family
know how to do best,

06:16.519 --> 06:18.240
mouth shut, eyes down.

06:18.319 --> 06:21.480
Good, it won't be the cops
that make Gennaro pay.

06:24.279 --> 06:26.639
We gotta get vengeance
for our own blood.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.120
The magistrate's authorized
the funeral.

07:18.199 --> 07:20.560
It's not gonna be in Naples, but in Rome.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.360
And we know where.

07:24.439 --> 07:27.759
Good, so we can bury them
with their mother and father.

07:27.839 --> 07:30.000
Don Gennaro, leave it to us.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.319
If they find you it's over
and we can't afford that.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.800
But we gotta move fast.

07:42.639 --> 07:44.639
We got people in Rome who can help us.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.519
When the time comes, we'll be ready.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.360
There's something else.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.480
Our guy in the DA's office said

07:53.560 --> 07:56.680
they don't know anything
about Patrizia's accusations.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.959
Good evening, counselor.

08:12.279 --> 08:15.240
It's been a while, Don Gennaro.

08:15.319 --> 08:18.040
What's with the formality?
We used to be close.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.079
Things change,
you're not a kid anymore.

08:23.839 --> 08:27.560
You were at my father's side
for 30 years, with loyalty and respect.

08:27.639 --> 08:30.000
You're part of the family.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.960
When Don Pietro died
I thought it was all over,

08:35.159 --> 08:38.360
instead it's like he's standing
in front of me again.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.399
I need to know what I'm accused of.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.919
The magistrate's a hardass,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.919
he's sealed the files,
but I'm working on it.

08:53.519 --> 08:55.720
We gotta move fast.

08:55.799 --> 08:57.799
Trust me, Gennaro.

09:17.399 --> 09:19.039
She's beautiful.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.279
You can tell she's got our blood.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.720
If Mamma was still here
she'd be proud of you.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.840
May she live to a hundred!

09:39.919 --> 09:41.840
A hundred years, kiddo!

09:45.240 --> 09:46.600
Come here.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.399
Come to Uncle.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.720
Lavinia, every kid you have comes out
better than the one before.

09:54.799 --> 09:57.639
- You better hold her.
- Come to Papa.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.399
You're right, Don Angelo,
but don't say that to Serena.

10:02.039 --> 10:04.120
She's very jealous.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.279
And whaddaya got
to be jealous of, Serena?

10:17.960 --> 10:20.399
Don Angelo sure loves kids.

10:23.279 --> 10:25.759
C'mon! Don't you want
to give him a baby?

10:27.159 --> 10:30.960
Still on about that, Lavinia?
It's not for us.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.480
You don't listen,

10:32.559 --> 10:35.759
but if you give him a son
you'll make him the happiest man alive.

10:38.559 --> 10:42.559
He's the happiest man alive
because he knows I love him,

10:42.639 --> 10:45.919
so much so that I don't want
to share him with anyone.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.639
You open your legs and babies come out.

10:52.039 --> 10:54.399
I keep my husband's face in there.

10:55.519 --> 10:57.480
If that's what you like...

11:06.399 --> 11:10.360
- You spoken to the guys in Rome?
- It seems it's all under control.

11:11.519 --> 11:13.440
There won't be any problems.

11:13.519 --> 11:17.559
There'll only be a police escort
for the hearse, people at the cemetery...

11:17.639 --> 11:19.879
It's not that simple, Luciana.

11:22.279 --> 11:24.840
You gotta do what you gotta do.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.080
What's wrong?

11:30.759 --> 11:33.840
He's the boss
and he knows we're nobody.

11:33.919 --> 11:36.279
That's why you gotta go by yourself.

11:37.519 --> 11:41.440
He'll know he can trust you
and that he needs us.

11:44.679 --> 11:45.639
Let's go.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.000
Fernando's taking you.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.559
Is it your will that Lucrezia Maria
Immacolata be baptized

13:11.639 --> 13:15.279
in the faith of the Church
we all profess?

13:15.360 --> 13:16.720
Yes, it is.

13:17.279 --> 13:19.919
Lucrezia Maria Immacolata, I baptize you

13:20.000 --> 13:24.120
in the name of the Father, of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

13:25.960 --> 13:30.639
Parents and godparents,
this light is entrusted to you

13:30.720 --> 13:34.120
to be kept burning brightly.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.840
May your child, enlightened by Christ,

13:38.919 --> 13:41.440
walk always as a child of the light,

13:42.360 --> 13:44.960
and keeping the flame of faith alive

13:45.039 --> 13:48.720
may she go to meet the Lord
with all the saints,

13:48.799 --> 13:50.679
in the heavenly kingdom.

15:15.279 --> 15:16.679
Come on, sweetie.

15:27.799 --> 15:30.679
Sweetie, what ride do you want to go on?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.480
What's wrong, Pietro?

15:38.559 --> 15:40.480
When's Papa coming back?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.759
Sweetheart, Papa's not coming back.

15:46.399 --> 15:47.879
He's never coming back.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.759
Let's go.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.920
- All good, bro?
- Yeah.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.000
Trust me.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.799
VERANO CEMETERY

20:30.079 --> 20:32.400
The cops are locking you in!

20:32.480 --> 20:35.319
They fucked us!
The cops are here, run!

22:40.920 --> 22:42.720
Close it!

23:40.720 --> 23:42.440
The exit's that way.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.799
We're close.

23:46.079 --> 23:49.440
The Levante family tomb is here, lot 329.

23:53.559 --> 23:57.440
I checked carefully, the ceremony
in church was booked for them,

23:58.480 --> 24:00.279
Gerlando and Benedetta Levante.

24:00.359 --> 24:04.839
Maybe it's like you say
but you shoulda checked better.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.279
When it's so important,

24:08.359 --> 24:12.480
an innocent mistake
becomes an unforgivable betrayal.

24:18.079 --> 24:19.799
Please...

24:45.599 --> 24:49.160
PRIMA PORTA CEMETERY

24:50.079 --> 24:52.079
Keep your eyes peeled.

25:09.359 --> 25:12.000
There was piranhas waiting at Verano.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.119
There was cops too.

25:15.799 --> 25:19.119
That's why the magistrate
had them buried here.

25:22.119 --> 25:24.960
Because of him they've been laid
to rest in no-man's land.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.000
And Gennaro's still free.

25:28.079 --> 25:30.359
We gotta take care
of Gennaro Savastano.

25:31.519 --> 25:34.440
We gotta bury him
under shit tons of dirt.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.640
I got a message for Mistral.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.240
Please, have a seat.

26:18.039 --> 26:20.680
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.

26:20.759 --> 26:23.599
If you're here in the middle
of the night, it's urgent.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.680
I know you want to talk to my husband,

26:26.759 --> 26:30.200
but he was godfather
at my niece's baptism today.

26:30.279 --> 26:34.039
He drank too much at the reception,
excuse him, he's not well.

26:35.559 --> 26:38.079
- He's resting.
- Sorry to hear it.

26:40.559 --> 26:43.839
You can tell me
whatever you have to say to him.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.359
I'm speaking on behalf of Don Aniello.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.400
I'm happy to listen.

26:54.319 --> 26:58.839
They say whatever is said to you
goes straight to Gennaro Savastano.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.960
They have an overactive imagination.

27:08.279 --> 27:12.039
But if they were right,
what would they want to say to him?

27:18.839 --> 27:23.000
My uncle sees what the Levantes
are doing in Secondigliano

27:23.960 --> 27:27.200
and he heard what happened
at the cemetery in Rome.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.000
Know what he thinks?

27:35.319 --> 27:37.799
Whoever's left of the Levantes

27:38.519 --> 27:41.079
should go join their family.

27:48.599 --> 27:49.799
Good evening.

28:09.279 --> 28:13.559
It was a trap, that shithead magistrate
was waiting for us.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.559
- The Levantes weren't there.
- The fuck you saying, Mistral?

28:17.480 --> 28:20.680
They made us look like idiots?
Are you an idiot?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.319
You an idiot?

28:24.480 --> 28:26.680
If you are, you better tell me now.

28:29.039 --> 28:32.319
My father said only fools
give second chances.

28:35.359 --> 28:39.160
Lucky for you I'm not my father,
but I'm not a fool either.

28:46.599 --> 28:50.960
Ambition's important, you need me
to get outta this shithole.

28:51.039 --> 28:52.960
I understand you.

28:53.839 --> 28:55.720
But you gotta do things right.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.119
Or I won't let you out of here.

29:07.359 --> 29:11.039
Don't worry, Donna Luciana,
your husband's as fit as a fiddle.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.279
But the heads of the Levantes
he promised me...

29:23.720 --> 29:25.920
I got a message for you.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.759
What's wrong, you don't like me?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.640
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks, Don Aniello.

31:01.839 --> 31:04.759
Don Gennaro's happy to meet you.

31:04.839 --> 31:08.279
But given the situation
he needs a safe place.

31:08.920 --> 31:13.119
Of course, this isn't
a great time for our Gennaro.

31:14.799 --> 31:16.920
He needs to be real careful.

31:18.559 --> 31:21.319
Does he know how
lucky he is to have you?

31:22.559 --> 31:24.599
Can I ask you something?

31:25.640 --> 31:27.920
Why are you with him?

31:28.000 --> 31:31.079
Obviously Gennaro
promised him something.

31:31.160 --> 31:34.759
What can he promise?
He's got nothing left.

31:34.839 --> 31:37.640
But whoever wins the war takes all.

31:39.119 --> 31:42.000
Picking an ally is fundamental.

31:43.119 --> 31:45.759
And that's why
we're here with Don Angelo.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.400
Isn't it?

31:54.759 --> 31:56.720
Every alliance has a price.

32:02.039 --> 32:04.640
Tell me what to say to Gennaro.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.440
That we have the perfect place
for the occasion.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.039
It's on for tonight.

33:32.319 --> 33:35.400
Good evening, Don Angelo,
the car's ready.

33:44.039 --> 33:45.799
It's all good.

33:50.759 --> 33:52.000
Good job.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.599
Good night.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.320
You know what you gotta do.

35:54.199 --> 35:57.199
This is the car I prepared for you.

36:05.519 --> 36:08.840
- We can't afford any mistakes.
- Trust me.

37:40.039 --> 37:42.960
We got Gennaro Savastano off our ass!

38:24.760 --> 38:26.320
Run!

39:12.719 --> 39:14.000
Go!

39:41.320 --> 39:44.079
Your uncle was right, Graduate.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.880
The most important thing
is to choose your allies well.

39:52.239 --> 39:54.199
You disgust me.

39:57.239 --> 39:58.760
Fair enough.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.719
Don Elia, everything okay?

41:06.920 --> 41:09.840
Here, Don Aniello, I got a gift for you.

41:23.639 --> 41:26.480
I wanted you
to say goodbye to your nephew.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.280
You're not worth shit.

41:44.360 --> 41:47.119
Your father knew it and you know it too.

41:50.039 --> 41:52.840
If that was true,
you'd be holding this

41:52.920 --> 41:55.320
and your nephew would still be alive.

42:00.599 --> 42:02.440
You can't kill me

42:03.719 --> 42:08.519
because I know something that's worth
more than your pent-up anger.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.320
Chitchat won't get rid of my anger.

42:26.639 --> 42:28.960
Ciro Di Marzio is alive.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.679
You're making things worse.

42:51.159 --> 42:53.119
I saved him.

42:54.519 --> 42:56.440
I helped him that night.

43:00.039 --> 43:01.960
He's left Naples.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.239
That so?

43:08.280 --> 43:10.199
Only I know where he is.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.920
if you want me to tell you,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.039
you gotta man up.

43:17.559 --> 43:19.599
Lower the gun

43:19.679 --> 43:23.079
and give me your word
that between you and me it ends here.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.079
Where is he?

43:42.280 --> 43:44.239
Far away.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.440
He's in Riga.

43:50.039 --> 43:53.599
He left you alone
with the remorse you killed him.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.039
IN THE NEXT EPISODE
