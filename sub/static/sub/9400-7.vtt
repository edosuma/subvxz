Nate - Mike wilson.

00:03.834 --> 00:04.850
Listen. I heard
you were looking

00:04.851 --> 00:06.400
For the opportunity
to play ball again.

00:09.365 --> 00:10.900
This is the coolest thing
i've ever seen.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.665
You have to do this, daddy.

00:12.666 --> 00:15.356
This can't be good
for my back

00:15.767 --> 00:17.387
<i>Man, that can't be good
for nobody's back.</i>

00:17.530 --> 00:19.060
You're coming back home.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.200
I guess I never really left.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.800
Can you help me make a cape?

00:22.830 --> 00:24.360
Quentin really likes mine

00:24.400 --> 00:28.200
And I thought maybe we
could make one for him too.

00:28.230 --> 00:30.300
Tell me where you live

00:30.330 --> 00:32.030
Because I'm pretty sure
it's not in shop class.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.960
I live in a foster home.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.400
Would d you be interested
in fostering a child?

00:36.430 --> 00:39.200
Well I guess it would
depend on the situation.

00:41.460 --> 00:44.030
I've never had my own room before.

Harrison manumary marson

00:55.500 --> 00:56.530
Luke!

00:56.560 --> 00:58.730
You should read this. it's really cool.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.000
Huh? my book?

01:00.030 --> 01:02.930
No. it's an article
about moving in together.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.500
It says we need to have our own space

01:05.530 --> 01:07.760
In order to ease the transition.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.300
Way ahead of you.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.760
What is that?

01:12.800 --> 01:15.260
Oh it's your cage silly.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.860
I figured you need your own space.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.060
And look it's even
got a little bed of hay.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.660
I know how you like hay.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.230
Luke cut it out.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.430
Come on.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.160
Get up. up.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.530
Man brooke looks hot here.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.160
Maybe you two could
share the cage huh?

01:44.130 --> 01:46.500
What?

01:47.900 --> 01:51.200
Funny I don't remember
ordering bad Italian.

01:51.230 --> 01:53.200
Sorry to bother you so late

01:53.230 --> 01:56.600
But uh caught you buying
drinks at the bar tonight.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.800
I know the license is yours

02:01.830 --> 02:04.460
But she claims to belong to you too.

02:05.930 --> 02:07.760
You have a
15-year-old daughter?

02:07.800 --> 02:08.960
How long has it been?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.930
Not long enough.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.800
Thanks.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.250
You are welcome.

02:17.250 --> 02:18.000
Sam?

02:18.030 --> 02:20.530
Can you just yell at me in the morning?

02:20.560 --> 02:21.700
I'm really tired.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.800
I'll bet you are.

02:25.830 --> 02:29.960
Because being brooke
davis is exhausting!

02:30.000 --> 02:31.800
I miss angie.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.200
Marvin?

02:38.230 --> 02:40.100
Millie what are you doing in omaha?

02:40.130 --> 02:41.030
What?!

02:41.060 --> 02:45.200
Oh my god! what are you doing here?

02:45.230 --> 02:48.560
I had this horrible dream
where I lived far away from you

02:48.600 --> 02:51.800
And every time I spoke I'd
say this awful catchphrase.

02:51.830 --> 02:53.430
Only it wasn't a dream.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.500
So I quit my job. again.

02:55.530 --> 02:56.830
For me?

02:56.830 --> 02:58.130
for us.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.860
Without you omaha just
felt cold and lonely.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.330
Do you feel better now?

03:03.360 --> 03:05.100
Now I'm just cold.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.430
Get in here.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
Whoa daddy can fly.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
yes he can.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.900
Oh I can't tell you
how happy it makes me

03:19.930 --> 03:21.360
To see you playing again.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.660
Thanks baby.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.500
You know it'd really make
me happy to see you play again.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.430
You haven't been in
the studio in a while.

03:27.460 --> 03:29.230
Yeah well too much
has happened lately

03:29.260 --> 03:30.500
To think about music.

03:30.530 --> 03:33.360
Well the deal was we both
go after our dreams remember?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.460
Yeah mama.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.130
I like when you sing.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.800
Oh you do huh?

03:43.960 --> 03:45.800
Oh never mind.

03:46.900 --> 03:47.750
I'll see you.

03:47.750 --> 03:48.600
okay bye.

03:48.630 --> 03:49.660
See you buddy.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.100
Hey. how'd you sleep?

04:01.130 --> 04:02.130
Not very well.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.930
Someone hit me with a magazine.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.130
I'm sorry.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.200
I was reading an article
in b.davis magazine

04:08.230 --> 04:09.860
And I had a bad dream.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.230
It's about moving in together.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.460
What's so scary about that?

04:14.500 --> 04:16.760
Well "once you move
in expect to find out

04:16.800 --> 04:19.529
You don't know each other
as well as you think."

04:19.560 --> 04:21.100
That's ridiculous.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.860
Everybody says we're like twins.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.260
Okay you're right.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.060
And to make up for the magazine attack

04:28.100 --> 04:30.630
I'm making your favorite breakfast.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.000
Oh really? french toast?

04:34.830 --> 04:35.900
Pancakes.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.800
Pancakes!

04:39.830 --> 04:43.200
Sam I made breakfast!

04:45.030 --> 04:46.730
Sam!

04:49.730 --> 04:52.400
Come on!

04:59.600 --> 05:01.460
Unbelievable.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.900
Ugh! cut it out!

05:05.930 --> 05:07.260
"cut it out!"

05:07.300 --> 05:09.100
Let go! you'll rip it!

05:09.130 --> 05:11.230
So? then you'll have two stupid capes.

05:11.260 --> 05:14.130
It's not stupid! I wear
it for my friend quentin!

05:14.160 --> 05:16.260
Then quentin must be stupid.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.760
Fight fight fight fight!

05:21.831 --> 05:23.946
"Just because he moved in

05:23.946 --> 05:25.510
Don't expect his stuff to move out."

05:25.550 --> 05:27.750
Apparently guys don't
like changing anything

05:27.780 --> 05:28.880
When a woman moves in.

05:28.910 --> 05:30.510
That's not true.

05:30.550 --> 05:31.880
Oh really? that's funny.

05:31.910 --> 05:33.750
'cause yesterday when I was cleaning

05:33.780 --> 05:35.880
I knocked over a picture
of you and lindsey.

05:35.910 --> 05:38.050
i...uh...

05:39.550 --> 05:40.680
I...

05:40.710 --> 05:43.580
I thought I got all those. i'm sorry.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.280
I know I'm being silly.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.510
I just feel like a guest in your house.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.680
And I haven't unpacked any of my boxes

05:49.710 --> 05:52.050
'cause I don't know
where to put anything.

05:52.110 --> 05:55.250
Well does the all-knowing
magazine have a fix

05:55.280 --> 05:57.210
Or does it just point out problems?

05:57.250 --> 05:58.580
Let's see.

05:58.610 --> 06:03.150
It says we should work it
out by communicating openly

06:03.180 --> 06:06.780
Compromising and
focusing on each other.

06:06.810 --> 06:10.650
Doesn't just say...that
we should have sex?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.680
Fine.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.110
How about this? okay...

06:17.150 --> 06:19.310
Neither one of us leaves

06:19.350 --> 06:22.150
Until you're completely moved in.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.250
Okay?

06:23.280 --> 06:26.810
I mean unless that is that
my sugar mama needs to work.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.410
Oh no your sugar
mama's her own boss.

06:29.450 --> 06:31.810
And she just gave me some time off.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.750
Okay. then it's official.

06:34.780 --> 06:37.050
We are...

06:38.510 --> 06:40.380
...on house arrest.

06:41.510 --> 06:45.080
Haiku is a japanese poem
which consists of three lines

06:45.080 --> 06:47.510
Of five seven and five
syllables respectively.

06:47.550 --> 06:49.980
A good example of this would be...

07:10.310 --> 07:12.410
My friend brooke davis

07:12.450 --> 07:16.110
Blowing through my class like wind

07:16.150 --> 07:18.580
Sam in trouble no?

07:20.450 --> 07:23.050
I hate school.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.150
School was never my
strong suit either.

07:25.180 --> 07:27.210
It's a good thing we're both handsome.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.210
What's wrong?

07:30.250 --> 07:33.050
I got in a fight with chuck scholnik

07:33.080 --> 07:35.750
'cause he teased me about my cape.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.310
I know the scholnik family.

07:37.350 --> 07:40.150
You should tease him
about his alcoholic mother.

07:40.180 --> 07:43.610
I just want him to leave me alone.

07:43.650 --> 07:45.250
Yeah I know the feeling.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.610
I was teased when I was in prison.

07:47.650 --> 07:48.880
About what?

07:50.550 --> 07:52.610
The point is that as a scott man

07:52.650 --> 07:55.150
People are always
gonna be jealous of you.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.610
It's a burden we have to live with.

07:57.650 --> 08:01.180
Scott men are inherently
better than most people.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.950
Daddy too?

08:02.980 --> 08:04.980
Especially your daddy.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.310
I thought we were past dressing
up to impress each other.

08:15.350 --> 08:17.550
Does this mean I need to
toss the footie pajamas?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.880
Well if the alternative
is you sleeping naked yes.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.310
I'm going to the station
to beg for my old job.

08:23.350 --> 08:24.950
I hope they take me back.

08:24.980 --> 08:27.810
They'd be stupid not to.
you're a big tv star now.

08:27.850 --> 08:30.210
With your own catchphrase
and everything.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.010
I'm sorry I ever spent
a minute away from you.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.909
You just said a mouthful.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.549
Very funny.

08:43.580 --> 08:46.580
I'm sorry I disrupted your class.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.980
It's okay. I turned you into a haiku.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.250
Gesundheit.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.080
I take it things aren't going
very well between you and sam.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.750
She stole my i.d. last
night and snuck out.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.780
When you asked me to take her

08:59.810 --> 09:02.550
I thought I'd be getting
little orphan annie.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.510
Instead of singing and dancing

09:04.550 --> 09:06.680
I have stealing and disappearing.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.680
Do you want me to talk to her?

09:08.710 --> 09:10.350
No. no I'll handle it.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.880
Okay.

09:14.350 --> 09:16.380
How do I handle it?

09:16.410 --> 09:19.580
You got to talk to her tonight
and lay down some ground rules.

09:19.610 --> 09:20.950
She needs structure.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.380
She's actually a really bright kid.

09:23.410 --> 09:24.680
Fine.

09:24.710 --> 09:27.950
For you I will try.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.210
I just -- I need her
to try too you know?

09:31.250 --> 09:33.450
Even if it's just a little.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.710
I think that's totally fair.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.250
Good.

09:38.980 --> 09:42.710
I'll let you know how it goes.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.880
Thank you brooke.

09:43.910 --> 09:46.780
Yeah thank me if I
don't kill her by tomorrow.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.580
So where do you want to start?

09:51.710 --> 09:52.850
Well that's easy.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.610
I never feel at home
until I unpack my music.

09:55.650 --> 09:58.180
But you know what?
maybe we don't have to.

09:58.210 --> 10:01.380
I mean we probably have
doubles of everything right?

10:01.410 --> 10:04.380
Actually I don't like the cure.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.880
How can you not like the cure?

10:07.910 --> 10:10.410
Well their music's
depressing and whiny.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.610
Yeah and if it could
squint it would be you.

10:12.650 --> 10:15.610
You do realize that the
lyrics I spent all day painting

10:15.650 --> 10:18.210
At the river court were
cure lyrics right?

10:18.250 --> 10:20.650
Oh yeah I know.
and I love the lyrics.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.780
I hate the music.

10:21.810 --> 10:24.080
I don't even know who you are right now.

10:24.110 --> 10:25.080
Come on peyton.

10:25.110 --> 10:26.650
Look I'm just trying to be honest.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.680
I mean there's got to be things
that I like that you don't right?

10:28.710 --> 10:31.110
Yeah. yeah okay.

10:31.150 --> 10:32.580
Now that you mention it.

10:32.610 --> 10:33.810
Your tattoo.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.850
What about it?

10:35.880 --> 10:38.210
Well first off it does
not mean what you think it does

10:38.250 --> 10:39.350
'cause I looked it up.

10:39.380 --> 10:43.080
Second brooke has
a very similar tattoo.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.180
Near her lady business.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.680
Now if you will excuse me

10:46.710 --> 10:48.360
I'm gonna go take my cure albums

10:48.360 --> 10:50.010
where they'll be appreciated.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.650
Like the trash?

10:53.080 --> 10:54.280
You see?

10:54.310 --> 10:57.810
We are totally different
just like the article says.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.610
Thanks a lot brooke.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.590
"friday I'm in love" isn't too bad.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.490
It's nice in here.

11:20.530 --> 11:23.400
How come we haven't moved
into the master bedroom?

11:23.430 --> 11:24.760
You mean mmom's room?

11:24.800 --> 11:26.430
No I mean the master bedroom.

11:26.460 --> 11:28.460
I mean she gave you the house right?

11:31.160 --> 11:32.830
It'd just be...

11:32.860 --> 11:37.230
Too weird sleeping in here as an adult.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.000
Who said anything about sleeping?

11:41.860 --> 11:43.590
No. definitely out of the question.

11:43.630 --> 11:46.430
Luke we are adults.

11:46.460 --> 11:47.830
Shouldn't we be in the adult room?

11:47.860 --> 11:49.030
Who's asking?

11:49.060 --> 11:51.660
You or b. davis magazine? hmm?

11:51.700 --> 11:55.490
Whichever will get you to do it.

11:57.530 --> 12:03.360
I would tell the magazine
that my room's bigger.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.590
And I like it better.

12:06.630 --> 12:10.330
And I would tell peyton that...

12:11.360 --> 12:13.930
...that I would do anything for her

12:13.960 --> 12:17.860
Even something as creepy as
sleeping in my mom's room.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.330
Then I guess I'm asking.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.730
Then I guess I'm moving.

13:03.930 --> 13:05.200
I love your music.

13:05.230 --> 13:07.000
Your album is one of my favorites.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.100
Thanks.

13:09.130 --> 13:10.990
I even have a slot
reserved in my cd case

13:10.990 --> 13:12.860
For your next record.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.930
There is gonna be a next record right?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.000
I hope so.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.000
I hope so too.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.230
Your voice is incredible.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.260
You're not so bad yourself.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.700
You don't have a cd I can buy do you?

13:21.730 --> 13:23.930
No no. i-i just do this for fun.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.700
But it must be amazing
to sing for a living.

13:26.730 --> 13:27.730
It used to be.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.060
So much has been going on lately

13:30.100 --> 13:32.430
Music doesn't seem to matter much.

13:32.460 --> 13:33.630
That's too bad

13:33.660 --> 13:35.300
Because it matters to
a lot of other people.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.530
Well it looks like your
music matters a lot too.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.400
You don't want to
keep your fans waiting.

13:39.430 --> 13:41.630
Neither do you.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.200
Hi chris.

13:56.230 --> 13:58.730
I wanted to talk to you
about how we left things.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.860
Just hear me out.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.130
I know that omaha's a bigger market.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.730
But this is your home.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.610
I agree which is why

14:04.610 --> 14:07.130
what'll it take? We need you.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.900
Well I could use an office

14:10.930 --> 14:13.430
Better snacks in the lunch room.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.800
And I had an intern in omaha.

14:15.830 --> 14:17.800
Done done and done.

14:19.130 --> 14:21.660
Thing is we need you to start a.s.a.p.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.960
Like uh...tomorrow?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.160
What do you think?

14:24.200 --> 14:26.560
I think omaha's gonna miss me.

14:28.130 --> 14:29.300
Terrific.

14:34.730 --> 14:36.400
Hey buddy.

14:38.860 --> 14:41.430
Your mom and I would like
to talk to you for a second.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.130
Think you could pause that game?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.260
Not if I'm in trouble.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.700
You're not in trouble.

14:45.730 --> 14:48.800
We just heard you got in
a fight at school today.

14:48.830 --> 14:50.560
A kid grabbed my cape.

14:50.590 --> 14:54.260
He wouldn't let go of
it. he said it was stupid.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.400
Sounds like that kid is stupid.

14:56.430 --> 14:59.760
I mean a man should know
never to grab another man's cape.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
Nathan.

15:00.830 --> 15:04.000
Your cape kiddo
is not stupid okay?

15:04.030 --> 15:07.230
when I was younger I had a poncho

15:07.260 --> 15:09.230
That everybody else said was really ugly

15:09.260 --> 15:11.360
But I really liked it
so I kept wearing it.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.800
And that's what you should do.

15:12.830 --> 15:13.960
If you like your cape

15:14.000 --> 15:15.590
You should just wear
it whenever you want

15:15.630 --> 15:17.230
And ignore what everybody else says.

15:17.260 --> 15:20.700
Well what if he keeps picking on me?

15:20.730 --> 15:24.200
Oh well I can teach you
how to deal with bullies.

15:24.230 --> 15:26.660
And what your father means by that

15:26.700 --> 15:30.530
Is if somebody's picking on
you you should just walk away.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.590
Right honey?

15:33.030 --> 15:35.830
Yes. yes she's right.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.730
But I want to be tough like daddy.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.260
If you can learn to walk away

15:41.300 --> 15:43.200
You'll be tougher than I ever was.

15:50.490 --> 15:51.630
It's not funny.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.490
I'm sorry.

15:53.530 --> 15:56.760
I'm only laughing because
of how angry you got.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.260
I mean I'veever heard
anybody yell at it before.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.030
Oh honey it is not a big deal.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.330
Doesn't it happen to
every guy at some point?

16:07.360 --> 16:08.730
And it wouldn't have happened at all

16:08.760 --> 16:10.030
If we weren't in my mom's bed!

16:11.960 --> 16:13.700
This is your fault.

16:13.730 --> 16:17.230
Well you have never complained before.

16:17.260 --> 16:20.760
I'm talking about your obsession
with this stupid magazine.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.800
Oh my god the
magazine has been dead on.

16:23.830 --> 16:26.700
It has predicted pretty much everything.

16:26.730 --> 16:30.100
I just wish it would
have warned me about this.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.160
Okay all right. Okay.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.460
What are you doing?

16:36.490 --> 16:39.430
Well it seems I've
made a huge mistake.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.960
I'm calling Lindsey.

16:42.130 --> 16:46.060
Fine.If you think that'll help.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.560
Hey. have I been in tonight?

16:54.590 --> 16:56.000
Was that a trick question?

16:56.030 --> 16:58.060
Sam? have you seen her?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.400
Not since last night.

16:59.430 --> 17:00.860
Why did she run out on you again?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.000
No.

17:02.030 --> 17:04.060
She's actually waiting in the car.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.160
I just needed an excuse to see you.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.900
Sorry I asked.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.099
You know you're a jerk.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.300
I told you I wanted to be a mom

17:14.329 --> 17:15.760
And you ran away so fast

17:15.800 --> 17:18.329
You left an Owen-shaped
hole in my front door

17:18.359 --> 17:20.329
And I never heard from you again.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.329
Not so much as a phone call.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.030
And if you hadn't caught
little Brooke Davis Junior

17:26.060 --> 17:28.060
With my I.D. I still wouldn't have.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.160
You're right.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.430
You didn't deserve that.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.260
I'm sorry.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.730
Whatever.

17:38.795 --> 17:41.504
You're still a jerk.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.080
What's going on?

17:51.110 --> 17:52.380
"when moving in

17:52.410 --> 17:55.650
"be ready for him to
unpack this little secret --

17:55.680 --> 17:57.250
He wants his own space."

17:59.380 --> 18:02.050
If it's in the magazine
it must be true.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.510
So you stay on your side of the line

18:04.540 --> 18:06.110
And you get my mom's bed.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.810
And I'll get the TV
and the kitchen huh?

18:08.850 --> 18:11.350
What is this "the brady bunch"?

18:11.380 --> 18:13.210
Just so you know
if you cross this line

18:13.250 --> 18:15.380
You'll be admitting that
this article is stupid.

18:16.210 --> 18:19.580
And that I'm right.About everything.

18:19.610 --> 18:22.010
Fine. looks like I get the bathroom.

18:22.050 --> 18:25.810
Fine.I'm hungry.

18:25.850 --> 18:30.950
I think I'll go make myself
some uh...french toast.

18:30.980 --> 18:34.210
Oh it is so on.

18:43.980 --> 18:47.540
Sweetie is that the boy
that was picking on you?

18:47.580 --> 18:49.950
No. I thought my shoe was untied.

18:49.980 --> 18:53.810
Bye mama. Bye sweetie.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.780
Excuse me could I
talk to you for a second?

18:57.810 --> 18:59.250
I'm Haley Scott. I'm Jamie's mom.

19:00.650 --> 19:03.110
Jamie came home from
school upset the other day.

19:03.150 --> 19:04.950
I guess your son was teasing him.

19:04.980 --> 19:07.050
Well you know how boys are.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.410
Don't you think we should
do something about it?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.780
No I think it's best

19:11.810 --> 19:14.610
If we let the boys work
it out for themselves.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.480
So much better than
tattling don't you think?

19:17.510 --> 19:18.850
Uh he's not tattling.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.280
He's 5 years old and he
just wants to be left alone.

19:21.310 --> 19:24.280
Jamie? Is he the one with the cape?

19:25.510 --> 19:27.650
5 is a little old for a
cape don't you think?

19:27.650 --> 19:31.440
Maybe you should do him a
favor take it away from him

19:31.480 --> 19:33.610
And then he won't get teased anymore.

19:33.650 --> 19:34.910
About the cape anyway.

19:34.950 --> 19:36.680
What is that supposed to mean?

19:36.710 --> 19:39.010
He's probably just a late bloomer.

19:39.050 --> 19:41.650
I'm sure he'll make friends... someday.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.910
Listen honey

19:42.950 --> 19:45.050
If your little brat doesn't
stop picking on my son

19:45.080 --> 19:47.350
Not only will I give Jamie
permission to kick his ass

19:47.380 --> 19:49.250
But I'll be kicking your
ass right alongside of him.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.350
Got that bitch?

19:50.380 --> 19:53.250
I'd like to see you try little girl.

19:55.650 --> 19:58.180
What happened to walking away?

19:58.210 --> 20:00.780
I know but you didn't see her.

20:00.810 --> 20:02.480
She was such a bitch.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.550
Sounds like you made that pretty clear.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.210
Jamie's been through so much lately

20:07.250 --> 20:10.910
The last thing he needs is
some bully picking on him.

20:10.950 --> 20:12.050
He'll be fine.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.110
He's a tough kid.

20:13.150 --> 20:15.450
But you know what? I'll take care of it.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.580
In the meantime

20:16.610 --> 20:19.010
Just try not to kill
anybody okay Slugger?

20:19.050 --> 20:20.680
What are you gonna do?

20:20.710 --> 20:23.550
I'm gonna call his mom a
bitch and then push her.

20:23.580 --> 20:24.580
Oh that's right.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.510
You already did that didn't you?

20:26.550 --> 20:28.950
Look I don't know
what I'm gonna do okay?

20:28.980 --> 20:31.710
But I'll take care of it.
I'll think of something.

20:31.750 --> 20:32.850
I'm sorry.

20:32.880 --> 20:37.910
Oh are you kidding
me? My girl is a badass.

20:37.950 --> 20:39.410
That's hot.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.580
Damn he's good.

21:12.150 --> 21:15.250
Look what I found on my side.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.780
Oh no no no no no.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.210
You cross you lose.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.110
"Fergie I love you very much

21:27.150 --> 21:29.750
"and miss you every time we're apart.

21:29.780 --> 21:33.250
I need to see you...soon."

21:33.450 --> 21:34.750
Don't you dare.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.350
What's up?

21:49.380 --> 21:52.780
Lucas loves him some fergalicious.

22:00.850 --> 22:03.950
Hi Brooke. it's nice to see you too.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.610
I'm sorry. I was just
hoping you might be Sam.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.350
But apparently all she
knows how to do is leave.

22:07.380 --> 22:09.480
Is it that bad?

22:09.510 --> 22:11.610
I think she likes me about
as much as I like my mother.

22:11.650 --> 22:14.780
Well we both know there's some parents

22:14.810 --> 22:16.260
You're better off without

22:16.260 --> 22:17.710
but you're not one of them.

22:17.750 --> 22:18.880
She'll realize that.

22:18.910 --> 22:20.710
Unfortunately she hasn't
stuck around long enough

22:20.750 --> 22:22.950
To figure that out.

22:22.980 --> 22:25.150
Thank you for coming to check on me.

22:25.180 --> 22:27.850
Well actually I need a favor.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.950
It's last minute

22:29.980 --> 22:31.710
It's a lot of work and
I need it in two hours.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.880
As tempting as that sounds
I'm still orphan-deep

22:35.910 --> 22:38.680
In the last favor I did
for the Scott family.

22:38.710 --> 22:40.610
It's for Jamie.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.010
What do you need?

22:47.050 --> 22:48.280
It's my new hero!

22:49.680 --> 22:52.910
I've been here three years.
I've never gotten a raise.

22:52.950 --> 22:55.110
You tell them to shove their job

22:55.150 --> 22:56.860
You get a better position

22:56.860 --> 22:58.580
a new office and a hot intern.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.780
Well I don't
know if --

23:00.810 --> 23:02.010
Hot intern?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.710
Gigi? Mouth!

23:10.850 --> 23:13.180
Wait you guys know each other?

23:13.210 --> 23:17.910
We were high-school lovers.

23:17.950 --> 23:19.380
Nice!

23:24.750 --> 23:26.450
It's a bird!

23:26.480 --> 23:27.810
It's a plane!

23:27.850 --> 23:29.550
It's
su-u-perbaby!

23:31.710 --> 23:33.580
Aw are you sad?

23:33.610 --> 23:36.510
Are you gonna go fly home to your mommy?

23:36.550 --> 23:39.950
No. I'm gonna walk away.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.980
So who doesn't think
that capes are cool?

23:47.750 --> 23:51.310
Well if I didn't have a
cape I couldn't do this.

23:59.910 --> 24:00.910
Oh by the way

24:00.971 --> 24:02.422
That box right there is full of capes

24:02.422 --> 24:03.873
If anybody wants one.

24:22.736 --> 24:25.322
You didn't come home last night.

24:26.290 --> 24:26.710
It's not my home.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.740
Besides you said I could
come and go as I please.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.270
So I left.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.790
That is not what I meant.

24:34.830 --> 24:37.420
I was worried about you.

24:38.980 --> 24:41.470
Sam... I can't help you

24:41.470 --> 24:43.960
If you're not willing to be helped.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.990
Apparently you'd rather
eat here than in my kitchen

24:47.990 --> 24:51.180
And you want to sleep in a
car instead of my guest room.

24:51.180 --> 24:53.910
I don't know what to do for you.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.040
I just don't think this is gonna work.

25:01.930 --> 25:02.810
It's okay.

25:04.780 --> 25:06.730
I'm used to people giving up on me.

25:07.970 --> 25:09.640
Happens all the time.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.810
See that waitress over there?

25:18.610 --> 25:20.190
That's my mom.

25:22.410 --> 25:24.380
One day I'm gonna tell her who I am

25:24.380 --> 25:26.650
And what a big mistake she made.

25:30.310 --> 25:32.960
Like I said I'm used to
people giving up on me.

25:35.860 --> 25:37.040
Thanks anyway.

25:38.660 --> 25:39.710
Sam...

25:45.410 --> 25:47.450
My god.

25:49.850 --> 25:52.160
So my girlfriend and I moved to omaha

25:52.160 --> 25:53.910
But then my girlfriend moved back.

25:54.370 --> 25:57.050
So I decided to move
back to be with her.

25:57.740 --> 26:00.690
You're so much more muscular
than you were in high school.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.830
Yeah my girlfriend is
really into being healthy

26:02.840 --> 26:04.980
So I am too.

26:05.010 --> 26:06.900
For my -- my
girlfriend.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.800
What have you been up to?

26:10.610 --> 26:13.250
Going to college. I'm
taking journalism classes.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.290
Having lots of sex.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.110
Oh and my mom had her
appendix out last week.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.410
That's...wow.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.180
It's so good to see you again.

26:26.370 --> 26:27.820
It's weird though

26:27.820 --> 26:29.280
Because I was thinking
about you just the other day.

26:29.310 --> 26:30.560
Oh yeah? what about?

26:30.560 --> 26:31.930
well I was walking to class

26:31.940 --> 26:33.310
And all of a sudden I thought

26:33.340 --> 26:35.190
"i should have had sex with mouth."

26:35.190 --> 26:37.040
Isn't that weird?

26:39.130 --> 26:40.420
Yeah that is weird.

26:42.090 --> 26:44.550
Did I mention that I have a girlfriend?

26:44.590 --> 26:47.680
Cool. I do too. sometimes.

26:55.070 --> 26:57.530
So nathan told me about the capes.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.270
You are officially the
world's greatest godmother

27:00.270 --> 27:02.430
And you've totally made jamie's year.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.150
Thank you so much brooke.

27:04.150 --> 27:06.240
At least I made one kid happy today.

27:07.010 --> 27:08.010
What happened?

27:10.550 --> 27:14.550
I was gonna talk to sam
last night like you said.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.380
And she never showed.

27:16.410 --> 27:20.140
And I just told her I
can't help her anymore.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.510
I'm sorry haley.

27:21.830 --> 27:23.320
No no.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.810
I should not have forced her on you.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.170
I just thought...

27:26.170 --> 27:28.410
If anyone could handle her you could

27:28.450 --> 27:31.610
Because you were a lot like
her and you got past it.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.370
I thought she could too
if somebody gave her a chance.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
Well I guess I'm not strong enough.

27:38.210 --> 27:41.420
Brooke you -- you're the
strongest person I know.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.960
You just gave up a
multimillion-dollar corporation

27:46.000 --> 27:47.210
And you seem fine about it.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.540
I wish I had your strength.

27:49.540 --> 27:50.720
My strength?

27:50.720 --> 27:54.860
Haley you gave up your
singing career to be with nathan

27:54.860 --> 27:57.210
Who was at least as
screwed up as me or sam

27:57.240 --> 27:59.650
When you got ahold of him.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.730
And now he's the best guy I know.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.570
Look it was scary.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.610
I was scared to death
to give up the company.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.820
But it wasn't fun anymore.

28:13.550 --> 28:15.940
And now I get to do what
I fell in love with --

28:16.540 --> 28:18.600
Design clothes on my terms.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.940
Yeah. that sounds familiar.

28:22.940 --> 28:29.210
I met a girl who sings on
the street every day for fun.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.980
It's amazing. she seems so happy.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.810
Music used to be like that for me

28:34.850 --> 28:36.580
And it's just not anymore.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.610
You know?

28:38.650 --> 28:40.780
Well then you need
to make it fun again.

28:40.810 --> 28:45.240
Find what you loved
about it and start there.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.750
You're too strong not to.

28:50.580 --> 28:53.210
I will think about it.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.650
Okay.

28:57.180 --> 28:59.780
You're definitely done with sam?

29:02.070 --> 29:03.080
I'll think about it.

29:04.380 --> 29:05.580
Good.

29:15.870 --> 29:17.700
Oh that's just not fair.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.290
What are you talking about?

29:19.680 --> 29:20.570
Oh you know what?

29:20.570 --> 29:23.570
It's dark in my room so I
was just gonna crash early.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.040
All by myself.

29:27.270 --> 29:29.810
Well it's nice and bright in my room.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.880
Thought I'd do a little
reading before bed.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.380
Maybe you should re-read your book

29:36.410 --> 29:40.010
And think about the
comet and how close it is

29:40.040 --> 29:44.240
But you can't touch it
'cause you're stubborn.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.070
Maybe I will.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.160
I love my book.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.200
Good good.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.480
I love sleeping naked.

29:56.700 --> 29:57.690
Damn she's good.

29:59.350 --> 30:02.870
And then daddy jumped 8
feet and dunked the ball.

30:02.870 --> 30:05.010
I was the most popular kid in school.

30:05.280 --> 30:09.260
I even got six girls' digits
like uncle skills taught me.

30:09.260 --> 30:10.580
Really? uncle skills?

30:10.580 --> 30:12.850
Well I'll be having a
conversation with uncle skills.

30:13.540 --> 30:16.630
Get used to being popular.
you're a scott boy.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.120
Mama why don't you
wear your poncho anymore?

30:21.570 --> 30:23.700
I think one day I just outgrew it.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.830
Good night buddy.

30:27.210 --> 30:28.610
Good night.

30:31.280 --> 30:34.040
I haven't told you how proud of you I am

30:34.080 --> 30:35.430
For walking away today.

30:37.760 --> 30:38.530
I didn't want to

30:38.570 --> 30:40.740
But you said it would make me tough.

30:40.780 --> 30:41.380
It does.

30:41.410 --> 30:44.010
It took me a long time
to learn that lesson.

30:44.950 --> 30:47.440
Those kids teased you about your
cape and you wore it anyway.

30:48.190 --> 30:50.760
They wanted to fight you
and you just walked away.

30:51.660 --> 30:54.050
See there's leaders
and there's followers

30:54.810 --> 30:56.950
And you are a leader.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.880
I wouldn't have fought him
but he said quentin was stupid

31:00.910 --> 31:02.940
And quentin was not stupid.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.770
Quentin was my friend.

31:06.210 --> 31:07.720
That's right. he was your friend.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.470
And he would be proud of you too.

31:16.450 --> 31:17.680
Good night buddy.

31:47.650 --> 31:51.750
Trust me Backseats are
not meant for sleeping.

31:51.780 --> 31:53.650
What are you doing here?

31:55.940 --> 31:59.080
I thought I'd crash
at your place tonight.

32:01.140 --> 32:02.910
I know what it feels like

32:02.910 --> 32:04.680
to have parents who give up on you.

32:04.710 --> 32:07.480
I had one who ignored me
and one who resented me.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.750
And sometimes I feel
like I'd be better off

32:09.780 --> 32:12.240
If I never had parents at all.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.710
No you wouldn't.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.750
Sam I don't want to make

32:15.780 --> 32:19.210
The same mistakes our parents made.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.030
I want you to move in with me

32:22.030 --> 32:24.810
on an official foster-home basis

32:24.850 --> 32:26.410
If you want to.

32:26.450 --> 32:28.980
What's the catch?

32:29.010 --> 32:30.650
There's no catch.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.210
There are rules.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.310
Breakfast is at 7:00 a.m. sharp.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.410
And no more stealing

32:37.450 --> 32:41.380
My stuff or anyone
else's but mostly mine.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.110
Deal?

32:46.140 --> 32:48.810
Deal.

32:56.380 --> 32:59.080
That is the last thing.

33:00.133 --> 33:01.443
I promise.

33:08.850 --> 33:11.110
What you did for jamie was amazing.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.980
I didn't do that for jamie.

33:13.010 --> 33:14.850
I did that for chuck's mom.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.250
I was afraid you were gonna kill her.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.810
Well you saved the day for everyone

33:21.850 --> 33:23.680
Like a big old superhero.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.050
You don't need a sidekick do you?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.380
A sidekick?

33:27.410 --> 33:28.540
No. oh!

33:28.580 --> 33:31.180
No I think tomorrow
I'll go back to being

33:31.210 --> 33:34.150
Mild-mannered slam-ball
player nathan scott.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.280
I wouldn't call you mild-mannered.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.480
What about you? what
are you doing tomorrow?

33:40.510 --> 33:43.510
I think I'm in the
mood to do some singing.

33:43.540 --> 33:45.150
It's about time.

33:53.910 --> 33:55.810
I tell you to stay and you disappear.

33:55.850 --> 33:58.710
I tell you to get lost
and you're at my doorstep.

33:58.740 --> 34:01.950
Apparently you have everything
backwards so come on in.

34:01.980 --> 34:04.010
Wait wait
wait. hey can --

34:04.050 --> 34:04.780
Can we talk?

34:04.780 --> 34:05.510
sure.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.850
How have you been? there we talked.

34:07.850 --> 34:09.460
Now if you don't mind it's late

34:09.460 --> 34:11.080
And I have a young girl sleeping inside.

34:11.110 --> 34:13.280
I just want a chance to explain myself.

34:13.310 --> 34:14.949
Fine.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.150
Explain.

34:18.780 --> 34:22.850
Look I got freaked out
when you mentioned the baby.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.980
I had a horrible childhood.

34:25.010 --> 34:28.679
Then I get addicted to
heroin really early on.

34:28.710 --> 34:33.110
Now I avoid anything more
responsible than making drinks.

34:33.150 --> 34:37.080
The thought of me being
a father is just too much.

34:37.110 --> 34:40.150
I never asked you to be the father.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.810
I know.

34:41.850 --> 34:44.540
But if you ever did...

34:44.580 --> 34:47.250
I know I wouldn't be any good at it.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.179
So I disappeared.

34:49.210 --> 34:53.280
And you have every
right to be mad at me.

34:53.310 --> 34:55.340
And I'm sorry.

34:58.380 --> 35:00.010
Have you ever considered

35:00.050 --> 35:03.210
That going through all
those awful experiences

35:03.250 --> 35:06.780
Is exactly what would make
you a good father someday?

35:06.810 --> 35:10.150
I've seen you be responsible with rachel

35:10.180 --> 35:12.180
And caring with jamie.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.410
You even brought sam home

35:14.440 --> 35:17.540
And she's a total stranger to you.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.010
Well truth be told

35:19.050 --> 35:22.510
I just brought her home
'cause I wanted to see you.

35:27.380 --> 35:30.010
Okay well if she's
at the bar tonight

35:30.050 --> 35:33.050
Then bring her home
and you will see me again.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.510
Then I hope she's in the drinking mood.

35:35.540 --> 35:36.740
But if not

35:36.780 --> 35:39.280
Then I hope the real
brooke davis will stop by.

35:41.610 --> 35:46.340
I promise you I won't
go anywhere this time.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.710
I'll think about it.

35:53.740 --> 35:55.250
Jerk.

36:28.640 --> 36:32.980
You know I read somewhere that
you should never go to bed angry.

36:33.010 --> 36:35.250
Now it wasn't b. davis magazine

36:35.280 --> 36:37.580
So I'm not sure if it's very valid.

36:37.610 --> 36:38.880
I'm not angry.

36:38.910 --> 36:42.580
In fact I've actually had fun
these last few days playing around.

36:42.610 --> 36:44.810
Especially since I've been winning.

36:45.980 --> 36:49.210
Before you get too
excited may I remind you

36:49.250 --> 36:53.280
That your moving boxes
were on my side of the line.

36:53.310 --> 36:55.680
What'd you do?

36:55.710 --> 36:59.280
Well I just unpacked
some of your stuff.

36:59.310 --> 37:04.310
I found a really great picture
to replace the one of lindsey.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.310
Oh luke that is sweet.

37:07.340 --> 37:10.150
Of course you went through my art again

37:10.180 --> 37:11.980
Without asking permission.

37:12.010 --> 37:13.580
My side my art babe.

37:13.610 --> 37:16.740
I think I'm starting to
like your side better.

37:16.780 --> 37:18.780
I was about to say the same thing.

37:18.810 --> 37:20.780
Let's be on the same side again.

37:28.340 --> 37:30.610
I really have to go to the bathroom.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.410
Oh my god I'm starving.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.480
Mm somebody smells good. hot date?

37:37.510 --> 37:38.910
No? why? it's just work.

37:38.950 --> 37:41.380
Touchy touchy. I'm just
saying you smell good.

37:41.410 --> 37:44.250
I'd say you look good too
but I don't want to get hit.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.680
Well go ahead. risk it.

37:45.710 --> 37:47.440
So how was your first day back?

37:47.480 --> 37:48.710
Was everyone happy to see you?

37:48.740 --> 37:49.810
Some of them.

37:49.850 --> 37:52.580
Well I'm thrilled to have you back.

37:52.610 --> 37:55.050
So do you have your new
tree hill catchphrase yet?

37:55.080 --> 37:55.880
I don't think I'm gonna need one

37:55.880 --> 37:56.680

37:56.710 --> 37:59.510
How about "mouthing off from the hill"?

37:59.540 --> 38:01.080
No.

38:01.110 --> 38:02.850
"if a tree falls your
mouth will make a sound"?

38:02.880 --> 38:03.910
Please stop.

38:03.950 --> 38:04.710
Or what about

38:04.710 --> 38:05.480

38:05.510 --> 38:06.740
"i'm marvin mcfadden

38:06.780 --> 38:09.180
And I am so glad I'm
back here with you."

38:09.210 --> 38:11.050
I love it.

38:13.050 --> 38:14.310
Bye grandpa!

38:14.340 --> 38:15.780
See you buddy.

38:18.010 --> 38:19.210
Bye honey.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.580
Ms. scholnik...

38:20.610 --> 38:22.850
Dan scott jamie's grandfather.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.440
That's a cute kid.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.050
Well kid anyway.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.640
You know I hear he and jamie

38:29.680 --> 38:31.680
Got in a little scuffle the other day.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.280
I sure hope they work out.

38:33.310 --> 38:34.780
You know what? I think
they already have.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.680
You know I'd love to join
you for your morning drink

38:36.710 --> 38:38.480
But I'm late for a meeting
with my parole officer.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.380
Murder.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.080
Hey! tell me you're on
your way to the studio

38:56.110 --> 38:57.950
To make your new record.

38:57.980 --> 38:59.110
Uh actually

38:59.150 --> 39:01.410
I was thinking about doing
singing for fun today.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.250
What do you think? you up for a duet?

39:03.280 --> 39:05.910
Are you kidding? I would be honored.

39:05.950 --> 39:07.950
Great. what do you want to play?

39:07.980 --> 39:09.950

40:04.110 --> 40:06.380

40:26.740 --> 40:28.810
You said breakfast at 7:00.

40:28.850 --> 40:29.950
It's 7:00.

40:29.980 --> 40:33.710
It's a start.

40:33.740 --> 40:36.880
Breakfast!

40:36.910 --> 40:41.010
Well your stuff is unpacked.

40:41.050 --> 40:42.580
The tape is gone.

40:42.610 --> 40:46.210
And the house is
officially both of ours.

40:46.250 --> 40:47.640
Perfect timing.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.150
I made waffles.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.810
I love waffles. I do too.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.610
Plus I got the recipe
from b. davis magazine

40:54.640 --> 40:56.210
So you know it'll be good.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.510
You better enjoy them because um...

40:58.540 --> 41:00.540
I canceled your subscription.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.150
What?!

41:03.310 --> 41:04.410
Holy cow.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.810
I forgot there was a
world outside the house.

41:09.980 --> 41:11.310

41:20.610 --> 41:22.340
