Hey, Mr. Duck,
you want to play?

00:05.762 --> 00:07.202
What are you doing
out of school?

00:07.237 --> 00:10.010
- It's spring break!
- Spring break?

00:10.044 --> 00:11.148
We get a week off from school.

00:11.182 --> 00:13.346
You're never in school.
How do you learn anything?

00:13.380 --> 00:17.154
You get a week off at Christmas,
three months off for the summer,

00:17.188 --> 00:18.661
and now you're on spring break?

00:18.695 --> 00:22.095
Huh. No wonder Canada's
killing us these days.

00:22.129 --> 00:23.760
So...do you want to play?

00:23.795 --> 00:27.198
No, I do not want to play.
I'm a grown up.

00:27.233 --> 00:29.170
Grown ups do not play.

00:29.204 --> 00:32.441
Hmmph!

You want to go to Acapulco?

01:07.761 --> 01:09.663
- What?
- Acapulco!

01:09.697 --> 01:13.134
A week of fun in the sun
on the Mexican Riviera!

01:13.169 --> 01:16.171
- What are you talking about?
- Spring break.

01:16.205 --> 01:17.707
Spring break is for students.

01:17.741 --> 01:21.011
What, students are the only
ones who need to cut loose

01:21.046 --> 01:22.379
and let it all hang out?

01:22.414 --> 01:25.984
I have a very stressful life.

01:26.019 --> 01:29.455
I need spring break.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.792
Forget it, I'll find
someone else to go with me.

01:31.826 --> 01:34.762
Someone fun.
Someone who knows how to party.

01:34.797 --> 01:39.200
I'm tellin' ya, you're going
to end up in a Mexican jail.

01:39.235 --> 01:42.871
Thanks, grandpa.
I'll send you a postcard.

[Doorbell rings]

Good evening.

Ehh...

01:50.246 --> 01:52.047
Why are you so dressed up?

01:52.081 --> 01:53.649
Duh, it's movie night.

01:53.684 --> 01:55.751
Yeah. Hang out
and watch a movie.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.788
Oh! I thought
we were going to be in a movie.

01:58.823 --> 02:03.194
Oh, I wish I knew that before
I memorized all these lines.

02:05.064 --> 02:07.466
Just take a week off from work.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.371
Tina, you need spring break
more than anyone.

[Stuttering] What you doin'?

02:28.192 --> 02:30.960
Trying to find someone
to go on spring break with me.

02:30.994 --> 02:31.794
Ooh, I'll go.

02:31.829 --> 02:34.330
Oh, you know who I didn't try?

02:34.365 --> 02:36.500
That guy who works
at the post office.

02:36.534 --> 02:39.237
I got to go.

02:39.738 --> 02:42.240
What's the name
of this movie again?

02:42.274 --> 02:44.777
[Sighs] "The Black Widow."

02:44.811 --> 02:47.480
Ok, is that guy
a good guy or a bad guy?

02:47.514 --> 02:49.282
Lola, the movie's
barely started

02:49.316 --> 02:51.451
and you've already asked
a hundred questions.

02:51.485 --> 02:53.352
All right, here's what
we're going to do--

02:53.387 --> 02:57.257
you get three more questions,
that's it.

02:57.291 --> 02:59.726
Oh, there's a subject? I thought
you were just wasting my time.

02:59.761 --> 03:01.896
- Who's the Black Widow?
- She is.

03:01.930 --> 03:03.497
Why is she called
the Black Widow?

03:03.532 --> 03:07.335
You're using up
your questions awful fast.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.371
Look, she's a jewel thief

03:09.405 --> 03:13.142
and she always leaves behind a
calling card with a spider on it.

03:13.176 --> 03:14.943
So they call her
the Black Widow.

03:14.978 --> 03:17.846
- Then who is--
- This is your last question.

03:17.881 --> 03:19.815
- I have to know!
- Fine.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.519
- Who is the Black Widow?
- You already asked that!

- It's her.
- Oh! No, it's not.

03:25.156 --> 03:28.091
It's that guy.
The detective!

03:28.125 --> 03:30.127
- What?
- He's in love with her,

03:30.161 --> 03:32.229
so he pretends to be
the Black Widow to protect her,

03:32.263 --> 03:34.565
and in the end,
he goes to jail for her.

03:34.599 --> 03:36.033
How do you know all this?

03:36.067 --> 03:37.827
Uh, "The Black Widow"
is my favorite movie.

03:37.836 --> 03:39.804
I've seen it a hundred times.
I've memorized all the dialogue.

03:39.838 --> 03:42.807
"Ma'am, I'm afraid we're going to
have to ask you some questions."

I won't bite."

break-in at the museum?"

"What are you implying,
detective?"

No, I don't think
it's weird to invite

03:54.688 --> 03:55.855
my plumber on spring break.

03:55.889 --> 03:59.893
Well, then, you can forget about
ever fixing my toilet again.

03:59.927 --> 04:03.797
And I put a lot
of weird stuff down there.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.269

I don't know anyone else.

Huh. Yeah, ok.

04:21.284 --> 04:22.351

at the Chinese restaurant

it was gone!

- Yes, everywhere!

you're going to have

06:08.957 --> 06:09.957
to tell your mom you lost it.

I can't! I borrowed it
without asking.

to have to face the music.

What are you talking about?

06:39.120 --> 06:41.888
This morning before I left,
I made biscuits

06:41.923 --> 06:44.124
and I think I forgot
to turn off the oven.

06:44.158 --> 06:45.592
It could start a fire!

06:45.626 --> 06:47.460
First of all,
who makes biscuits

06:47.494 --> 06:49.229
before they leave town
for a week?

stop worrying.

only a week.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.887
I mean, uh, what makes you
think it was stolen?

07:44.921 --> 07:49.091
Because the thief
left this behind.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.697
- You have to help me.
- Me?!

07:54.732 --> 07:56.199
Well, I can't call the police!

07:56.233 --> 07:59.535
They'd alert Patricia, and I can't
have her know it's missing.

07:59.570 --> 08:00.837
It would break her heart.

08:00.871 --> 08:04.107
Do you have any ideas
to how we could catch

the Black Widow?

08:05.843 --> 08:07.276
Uh...

08:07.311 --> 08:08.878
I think I might.

08:08.912 --> 08:10.947
You said you were going
to face the music.

08:10.981 --> 08:15.318
I did. I have been listening
to this for like six hours.

08:15.352 --> 08:18.487
What, am I facing the wrong way?

08:18.522 --> 08:21.090
[Music stops]

to buy some time

while I look for the bracelet.

08:26.830 --> 08:27.963
[Sighs] Ok.

08:27.997 --> 08:30.699
We have to retrace your steps
from that night.

08:30.733 --> 08:33.234
Now where did you go
after you left my house?

08:33.269 --> 08:35.270
I told you,
I went straight home.

08:35.304 --> 08:38.006
No, wait!
I didn't go straight home.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.808
I stopped for frozen yogurt!

08:40.842 --> 08:43.443
Great. You probably lost it
at the frozen yogurt place.

08:43.479 --> 08:46.747
Well, not necessarily. Because while
I was eating the frozen yogurt,

08:46.782 --> 08:48.616
I got a massive brain freeze,

08:48.651 --> 08:50.118
so I drove myself
to the hospital.

08:50.152 --> 08:52.386
[Tires squealing,
horns honking]

08:52.421 --> 08:54.956
Hmm. Then maybe
it's at the hospital.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.392
No, I never made it
to the hospital. I got lost.

08:57.426 --> 08:59.794
Turns out you can't drive
somewhere with your eyes shut.

08:59.828 --> 09:02.330
When I opened my eyes,
I was parked in front

09:02.364 --> 09:03.831
of a 24 hour
spray tanning salon,

09:03.866 --> 09:07.067
so I went in and got the mega
bronzer total body special!

09:07.102 --> 09:09.336
So it could be
at the tanning salon.

09:09.370 --> 09:13.139
Well, unless it's at
the shooting range.

09:13.707 --> 09:15.841
I was on such a sugar rush
from the fro-yo

09:15.875 --> 09:17.608
that I thought I have
to shoot something.

09:17.643 --> 09:20.878
So I shot a round of skeet
at Randy's all night gun club.

09:20.913 --> 09:22.646
Did you ever go home?

09:22.681 --> 09:24.081
Yes!

09:24.115 --> 09:26.250
Right after
I went night swimming.

09:26.284 --> 09:27.150
Night swimming?

09:27.185 --> 09:28.986
Oh, it was freezing cold
and terrifying.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.054
I probably will never
do it again.

09:31.089 --> 09:33.257
So it could be
at the bottom of a lake.

09:33.291 --> 09:34.825
Or the other places
I mentioned.

09:34.859 --> 09:40.163
But yes, the bottom of the lake
is a distinct possibility.

09:43.567 --> 09:47.136
We've been on this bus
for nine hours.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.506
When are we going
to be in Acapulco?

09:49.540 --> 09:52.775
[Bus stops]
You see, we're here.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.543

10:06.623 --> 10:08.390
I'll ask this guy.

10:08.424 --> 10:11.460
Excuse me, can you tell me
where the beach is?

10:11.494 --> 10:13.629
The beach?

10:13.663 --> 10:15.597
- Acapulco.
- Acapulco?

10:15.632 --> 10:20.602
This isn't Acapulco.
This is Tacapulco.

10:20.637 --> 10:23.505
[Bus honks musical horn]

10:23.539 --> 10:25.373
Wait!

10:25.408 --> 10:26.808
Wait!

10:26.842 --> 10:29.710
Don't--don't worry.

10:29.745 --> 10:32.312
The bus will be back.

10:32.347 --> 10:35.515
In a week.

[No audio]

10:57.640 --> 10:58.907
Did you find it?

10:58.942 --> 11:01.410
[Sighs] No.

11:01.445 --> 11:02.411
And thanks for helping.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.980
Well, I'm not going to ruin
another spray tan.

11:05.015 --> 11:08.017
We've looked everywhere.
The bracelet's gone.

11:08.051 --> 11:09.485
You got to come clean.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.087
You're right.

11:11.121 --> 11:13.422
The Hillhurst diamond
has been stolen.

11:13.457 --> 11:16.525
Left in its place,
a calling card from the thief,

11:16.560 --> 11:19.962
who goes by the name
"The Black Widow."

11:19.996 --> 11:22.298
Police are investigating
while security at the museum

11:22.332 --> 11:27.636
has been tightened in case the black
widow attempts to strike again.

11:27.671 --> 11:30.806
Why did you steal
the Hillhurst diamond?

11:30.841 --> 11:32.274
I thought you were going
to come clean!

11:32.309 --> 11:35.044
I did. I took
like a two hour shower.

11:35.078 --> 11:36.879
I mean, my spray tan's
completely gone.

11:36.914 --> 11:41.017
Bugs, the Black Widow wouldn't
just steal a bracelet.

11:41.052 --> 11:42.652
The Black Widow is insatiable.

11:42.687 --> 11:45.389
She couldn't resist
a famous diamond on display

11:45.423 --> 11:46.390
at the local museum.

11:46.424 --> 11:47.824
Sure, she knows
she'll be caught in the end,

11:47.859 --> 11:49.860
but the Black Widow
can't resist the thrill.

11:49.894 --> 11:51.128
She wants to be stopped,

11:51.162 --> 11:52.562
but who can stop
the Black Widow?

11:52.597 --> 11:55.365
There is no Black Widow!
It's a movie!

11:55.399 --> 11:58.868
- Ohh. Right.
- You got to put it back.

11:58.903 --> 12:01.204
How? Now that
there's been a break in,

12:01.238 --> 12:02.505
security will be too tight.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.407
I'll never be able
to do it alone.

12:04.442 --> 12:06.843
You need to help me, detective.

12:06.877 --> 12:11.013
You need to stop
watching that movie.

12:12.771 --> 12:14.438
- Oh, dear.
- What?

12:14.472 --> 12:16.625
I think I left
my curling iron on.

12:16.745 --> 12:18.209
Curling iron?

12:18.243 --> 12:19.652
You don't have any hair.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.881
It's for my tail.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.085
Sometimes I forget
to turn it off.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.222
And it says very clearly
on the side,

12:26.256 --> 12:27.823
"Do not leave unattended."

12:27.858 --> 12:30.793
It's unattended!
It could start a fire!

12:30.827 --> 12:32.461
You are bumming me out, Porky!

12:32.495 --> 12:35.030
Now listen, we may be
in the middle of nowhere,

12:35.065 --> 12:39.135
but I am determined
to make this spring break epic.

12:39.169 --> 12:41.603
We got to do
something crazy, man.

12:41.638 --> 12:44.005
All right, let me think,
let me think here.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.106
I got it!

12:45.141 --> 12:49.210
What if we attach a million
balloons to that donkey?

12:49.244 --> 12:51.045
And just watch him fly away.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.648
Where would we get
a million balloons?

12:53.682 --> 12:56.084
Ok, good point.
I got it!

12:56.118 --> 12:59.621
Maybe we roll him around
in maple syrup

12:59.655 --> 13:02.424
and stick a bunch
of newspapers to him.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.826
Where are we going
to get the syrup?

13:04.860 --> 13:05.727
Or the newspapers?

13:05.761 --> 13:07.662
You know,
it's real easy to be the guy

13:07.696 --> 13:08.729
who points out the problem.

13:08.764 --> 13:11.366
I need the guy
who points out the solution.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.534
Ahh, I can't think.

13:13.569 --> 13:15.269
It's too hot.

13:15.304 --> 13:17.038
That's it.

13:17.072 --> 13:19.407
I don't know if this is
such a good idea.

13:19.441 --> 13:23.678
Porky, streaking is one of the
ultimate spring break pranks.

13:23.712 --> 13:26.181
So we're really doing this?

13:26.215 --> 13:29.451
Oh, we are doing this.

13:31.554 --> 13:34.623
On the count of three...

13:34.657 --> 13:37.693
1, 2, 3!

13:37.727 --> 13:38.460
Whoo-hoo!

13:38.494 --> 13:42.430
We're on spring break!
We're crazy!

13:42.464 --> 13:43.831
Whoo!

13:43.865 --> 13:45.433
[Both laughing]

13:45.467 --> 13:47.435
Yeah! Yeah! We're crazy!

13:47.469 --> 13:50.238
Look at us! Check it out!

13:50.272 --> 13:51.506
Whoo!

13:51.540 --> 13:53.208
[Whooping]

13:53.242 --> 13:56.177
What is a matter
with you people?!

13:56.211 --> 13:58.012
Don't you get it?

13:58.047 --> 14:00.915
We're streaking!

14:01.317 --> 14:04.519
We are completely naked!

14:04.553 --> 14:07.955
[All gasping]

14:08.957 --> 14:11.226
[Cell doors slam]
Jail?!

14:11.260 --> 14:14.529
For streaking?
It's spring break!

14:14.563 --> 14:16.297
It's what you do.

14:16.332 --> 14:19.501
Maybe we should have done
something to that donkey.

14:19.535 --> 14:23.739
The Rothwell Gallery is here,
just off the museum lobby.

14:23.773 --> 14:25.508
Now, because
of the increased security,

14:25.542 --> 14:27.576
we won't be able
to enter through the air ducts

14:27.611 --> 14:28.978
like I did when
I took the diamond.

14:29.012 --> 14:32.949
Instead, we'll have to make
an aerial assault.

14:42.092 --> 14:44.827
Once we land on the roof,
we use a glass cutter

14:44.861 --> 14:47.330
to carefully remove
a section of the sky light

14:47.364 --> 14:49.465
directly over
the Rothwell Gallery.

14:49.500 --> 14:53.269
At 11:00, the guard
begins his rounds.

14:53.303 --> 14:55.738
At 11:03, he makes his way
to the Egyptian wing.

14:55.772 --> 14:59.476
And that's when we'll lower ourselves
towards the gallery floor.

14:59.510 --> 15:01.578
Once we're there,
I'll place the Hillhurst diamond

15:01.612 --> 15:04.114
back on her pedestal,
while you remove

15:04.149 --> 15:05.950
the surveillance tape
from the security office.

15:05.984 --> 15:10.888
Then we'll climb back up
the rope, and we're home free.

15:11.189 --> 15:12.823
- Lola.
- What?!

15:12.858 --> 15:14.592
What is this on your ankle?

15:14.626 --> 15:16.627
[Gasps] My mom's
diamond bracelet!

15:16.662 --> 15:19.196
Now I remember.
Before I went to bed that night,

15:19.231 --> 15:21.532
I wanted to see what it would
look like as an anklet.

15:21.566 --> 15:26.670
I didn't lose it.
I was wearing it the whole time.

15:27.338 --> 15:30.507
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

15:30.542 --> 15:33.110
Porky, it's fine.
We'll get out.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.245
No, it's not that.

15:34.279 --> 15:36.981
- I think I left my curtains open.
- So what?

15:37.015 --> 15:38.950
Well, on my desk is an
antique magnifying glass.

15:38.984 --> 15:43.154
If the sun's rays were to pass through
the magnifying glass just so,

15:43.188 --> 15:45.389
the papers on my desk
could ignite,

15:45.424 --> 15:49.059
starting a fire that could
burn down my entire house!

15:49.094 --> 15:52.830
Man, I wish that guy
from the Chinese restaurant

15:52.864 --> 15:56.300
had called me back.

15:57.603 --> 15:59.638

15:59.672 --> 16:03.141
You're going to rot in this jail

16:03.175 --> 16:08.113
for the rest
of your miserable lives!

16:08.148 --> 16:10.349
But first...

16:10.383 --> 16:14.220
You get one phone call.

16:15.389 --> 16:19.626
Take it. It's heavy!

16:46.121 --> 16:48.155
How you doin'?

16:48.190 --> 16:50.124
Can I try someone else?

Sure. Why not?

16:56.398 --> 16:58.766
Who is calling so late?

16:58.800 --> 17:02.336
Speedy, it's Daffy. You're
never going to believe this.

17:02.371 --> 17:04.338
You're in a Mexican jail.

17:04.373 --> 17:05.440
How'd you know?

17:05.473 --> 17:07.709
[Sighs] Where
in Mexico are you?

17:07.742 --> 17:09.578
Tacapulco.
It's in the middle of nowhere.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.614
You've probably never heard of it, but
let me tell you something, it's--

17:12.648 --> 17:16.319
- I used to live here.
Where's the sheriff?

17:18.521 --> 17:23.358
Speedy Gonzales.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.695

17:40.310 --> 17:42.878
- Cousin!
- Cousin!

17:42.913 --> 17:45.515
It's so good to see you!

17:45.549 --> 17:48.952
How have you been?
How's Lucinda and the babies?

17:48.986 --> 17:51.721
They're not babies anymore.

17:51.755 --> 17:53.322
Oscar is seven

17:53.357 --> 17:55.491
and Pepito is four.

17:55.526 --> 17:58.227
Ay, ay, ay!
It's been too long.

17:58.262 --> 17:59.095
Ahem.

17:59.129 --> 18:01.631
So, uh, does this mean
we're free to go?

18:01.665 --> 18:05.101
You're not going anywhere...

18:05.135 --> 18:08.705
until we have a fiesta!

He's not just the fastest mouse
in all of Mexico,

18:19.483 --> 18:24.053
he's also a successful
restaurateur!

18:24.088 --> 18:25.254
Tell them.

18:25.289 --> 18:27.023
Ay, no, it's not
that big a deal.

18:27.057 --> 18:29.192
It's just a pizza place.

18:29.226 --> 18:30.860
Ohh!

18:30.894 --> 18:32.629
[Giggles]

18:32.663 --> 18:34.764
Psst, Porky.

18:34.798 --> 18:37.967
This is going to be epic!

18:39.370 --> 18:41.471
[Laughs]

18:41.505 --> 18:43.807
Ohh!

18:44.542 --> 18:49.045
Call Dr. Weisberg!

18:50.347 --> 18:53.049
Bugs Bunny?

18:53.084 --> 18:54.551
You're free to go.

18:54.585 --> 18:57.854
See you guys later.

18:57.889 --> 19:01.391
Well, probably not.

19:03.428 --> 19:05.229
Bun bun!

19:06.030 --> 19:09.366
So, you finally let
the cat out of the bag.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.468
Oh, right! Thank you.

19:11.503 --> 19:13.971
Yahhh!

19:15.273 --> 19:17.674
Lola confessed everything.

19:17.709 --> 19:20.010
She told you
she's the Black Widow?

19:20.045 --> 19:22.146
[Whistles]

19:22.180 --> 19:24.515
What? Ha ha! No!

19:24.550 --> 19:28.586
She said you took the bracelet
to have one made just like it

19:28.620 --> 19:32.123
to give to Lola as a surprise
so that she and her mother

19:32.157 --> 19:33.658
could have matching bracelets.

19:33.692 --> 19:35.927
And that you took
the Hillhurst diamond

19:35.961 --> 19:37.361
to throw us off your trail

19:37.396 --> 19:40.698
and buy yourself more time,
but then you returned it

19:40.732 --> 19:43.901
because it was the right
thing to do. [Laughs]

19:43.935 --> 19:48.873
I would have done
the exact same thing.

19:56.882 --> 19:58.049
You know what, Daffy?

19:58.083 --> 20:01.819
I'm really glad you asked me
to go with you on spring break.

20:01.853 --> 20:04.322
Ahh. I did need to cut loose.

20:04.356 --> 20:06.591
[Laughs] I can't believe

20:06.625 --> 20:09.091
I was worried about
an open curtain.
