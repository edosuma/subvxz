Previously on <i>Royal Pains:</i>

00:02.337 --> 00:04.003
What are you doing here?

00:04.005 --> 00:06.592
I've left your father.

00:06.594 --> 00:08.122
I got fired.

00:08.124 --> 00:10.474
Why didn't you tell me?

00:10.476 --> 00:12.163
Because you've been preoccupied

00:12.165 --> 00:13.867
ever since I stepped
through the door.

00:13.869 --> 00:16.959
- Close the gate!
- Stay where you are!

00:16.961 --> 00:19.652
Get the truck!
Stay there.

00:19.654 --> 00:22.682
- Are you suggesting...
- Are you offering?

00:22.684 --> 00:24.348
Yes, he is, and yes, you are.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.114
Okay, let's make this official.

00:26.116 --> 00:29.976
To the return
of the living Hankmed.

00:29.978 --> 00:32.011
[Gunshot]

00:32.012 --> 00:34.411
I didn't hear a thing.

00:36.581 --> 00:40.482
Hank, an intruder
has breached the perimeter.

00:40.484 --> 00:42.786
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you're too late.

00:42.788 --> 00:45.556
[Boris speaking hebrew]

00:49.359 --> 00:51.260
I've got a pulse.

00:51.262 --> 00:52.861
Call 911.

00:52.863 --> 00:54.195
Looks like he's been
shot in the heart.

00:54.197 --> 00:57.430
He's bleeding profu...

00:57.432 --> 00:59.198
I've lost his pulse.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.900
All right,
we need to open his chest.

01:00.902 --> 01:04.102
Anyone here have
combat medicine experience?

01:04.104 --> 01:06.004
I need help now.

01:06.006 --> 01:07.338
[Speaking hebrew]

01:10.708 --> 01:14.844
Okay.
Here, bag him.

01:14.846 --> 01:17.178
Glove up.

01:19.048 --> 01:22.049
Either of you have
a flashlight?

01:22.051 --> 01:24.784
Good, thank you.

Making the incision.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.021
Hank...
What are you doing?

01:29.023 --> 01:30.955
He may be
losing blood too fast.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.523
If I don't stop it,
he'll bleed to death

01:32.525 --> 01:35.525
before the ambulance gets here.

01:41.262 --> 01:43.763
Hold this open.

01:43.765 --> 01:45.464
Spread the ribs
as much as you can.

01:45.466 --> 01:48.198
Now!

01:48.200 --> 01:49.399
That's it.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.934
Okay.

01:54.205 --> 01:57.506
Yup, there's the hole.
The bullet's embedded.

01:57.508 --> 01:58.908
Must've sent him into v-fib.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.877
- Will you remove it?
- It's in the left ventricle.

02:00.879 --> 02:03.179
I've got to take it out
before I get the heart started.

02:30.170 --> 02:31.870
[Boris snaps]

02:34.807 --> 02:36.608
He's bleeding too fast.

02:36.610 --> 02:41.746
I need to plug the hole with
my finger till he's in an O.R.

02:41.748 --> 02:44.282
I'm pumping it to get
the blood circulating again.

02:44.284 --> 02:47.084
Come on, beat.

02:49.021 --> 02:52.156
There we go.
He's alive.

02:52.158 --> 02:55.059
He's alive.

02:55.061 --> 02:57.194
Yes.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.835
Removed a small-caliber bullet
from the left ventricle.

03:04.837 --> 03:06.903
My finger's in the hole to
prevent him from exsanguinating.

03:06.905 --> 03:08.705
You're gonna have to keep it
there while we prep him.

03:08.707 --> 03:11.708
I'll cancel my dinner plans.

Hi.

03:27.592 --> 03:29.692
Hi. We need to get statements
from you and the victim.

03:29.694 --> 03:32.395
Oh, well, he'll be in surgery
for a few more hours,

03:32.397 --> 03:33.763
and I don't know what
I can tell you.

03:33.765 --> 03:36.132
I heard the shot
from the guesthouse,

03:36.134 --> 03:39.568
ran up and found Mr. Kuester
Von Jergens Ratinecz

03:39.570 --> 03:40.936
and a few guards.

03:40.938 --> 03:43.406
- One shot?
- Yep.

03:43.408 --> 03:47.243
- Do you know who fired it?
- No.

03:47.245 --> 03:50.413
Did the victim have a weapon?

03:50.415 --> 03:52.581
- I-I-I don't know.
- Okay.

03:52.583 --> 03:55.050
We still need a detailed
statement for the report,

03:55.052 --> 03:57.653
but we can wait until tomorrow.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.488
- Okay.
- Nice work.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.957
Thank you.

I think you were
just showing off.

04:05.862 --> 04:07.829
- Hey.
- So what'd they say?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.865
They just asked questions...

04:09.867 --> 04:12.767
That I don't have answers to.
Mm.

04:13.069 --> 04:15.570
You know, one of the nurses
knows a cop

04:15.572 --> 04:17.471
who told her the guy
is a John Doe.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.041
He got in with an hvac crew
to case the place.

I don't get it.

- When we left here earlier,

04:36.893 --> 04:38.326
there were flashing lights.

04:38.328 --> 04:40.694
There were squad cars,
yellow tape.

04:40.696 --> 04:41.995
Maybe they've already finished.

04:41.997 --> 04:44.965
No, not that fast.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.759
Yeah, it's so exciting.

So obviously we've expanded
the staff, but...

06:04.931 --> 06:06.364
hey, before we start,
I got a couple ideas.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.599
So how is that before we start?

06:08.601 --> 06:09.901
That's starting.

- Who is he again?
- Uh, Ken Keller.

when it was just me.

you're a silent partner,

Well...

Do you prefer Ken or Keller?

06:24.983 --> 06:26.984

06:26.986 --> 06:28.284

06:28.286 --> 06:30.487

the expanded staff

I love you and thank you.

06:42.434 --> 06:43.566

but we haven't even

06:43.568 --> 06:45.602
started the meeting yet.
Really?

06:45.604 --> 06:46.703
I heard "agenda item three."

06:46.705 --> 06:48.204
I know.
It was a misfire.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.673
- Oh.
- Muffin time will be later.

06:50.675 --> 06:52.175
- All right.
- Great.

06:52.177 --> 06:54.244

one agenda item...

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Together.

intruding per se.

you might need this.

I can't believe
I left my phone.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.395

and adjourn the meeting.

to this <i>important meeting!</i>

Yes. Thank you.

Well...

07:57.144 --> 07:59.344
This is supposed to be
agenda item number four,

07:59.346 --> 08:01.247
but how about you and Divya
see the new patient,

08:01.249 --> 08:02.882
Veronica Sullavan?
Her address is in there.

08:02.884 --> 08:04.683
Sounds like a plan.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.986
[Stammers] So the meeting...

08:06.988 --> 08:09.889
Kinda got out of control.

08:09.891 --> 08:11.456
Yeah. Kinda reminded me
of my old

08:11.458 --> 08:12.691
Brooklyn hospital meetings.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.560
Way too much talking,
and nothing gets done.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.895
So basically the exact
nightmare scenario

08:16.897 --> 08:18.363
you pictured
when I pitched expansion?

08:18.365 --> 08:19.664
Well, it helped
that you were suffering

08:19.666 --> 08:21.032
through the meeting, too.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.201
No, no, growing pains.
Those are growing pains.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.004
All right, from now on
I'll email an agenda in advance.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.741
I'll limit all comments
to ten seconds or less,

08:28.743 --> 08:30.542
and I'll require that
all refreshments are consumed

08:30.544 --> 08:31.744
prior to the meeting...
how's that?

08:31.746 --> 08:32.945
It's a start.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.346
Wow.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.784
Please tell me that
we have somewhere to get to.

08:37.785 --> 08:41.287
That post-meeting was worse
than the actual meeting itself.

08:41.289 --> 08:42.956
We do. Let's get to it.

08:51.332 --> 08:53.867
Hi. Thank you for coming.

08:53.869 --> 08:56.003
My regular doctor
is in Manhattan,

08:56.005 --> 08:58.172
but I have so many clients
in the Hamptons

08:58.174 --> 08:59.840
that I just don't like to leave

08:59.842 --> 09:01.575
unless absolutely necessary.

09:01.577 --> 09:04.311
- Do you perform weddings?
- No, I don't.

09:04.313 --> 09:06.546
I perform introductions.

09:06.548 --> 09:09.782
I'm a matchmaker.
This is my wall of fame.

09:09.784 --> 09:11.584
Are you two single?

09:11.586 --> 09:13.319
I have some space
on my wall still.

09:13.321 --> 09:14.720
I'm married to my work.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.322
Haven't gotten around
to buying the ring yet,

09:16.324 --> 09:17.323
but I will.
[Laughs]

09:17.325 --> 09:20.293
And are you open to...
No.

09:20.295 --> 09:21.661
Just checking.

09:21.663 --> 09:23.430
Hazard of the job.

Ooh...

09:29.972 --> 09:33.140
There's that again.
Sorry, light-headed.

09:33.142 --> 09:35.676
That's been happening
all morning.

09:35.678 --> 09:38.546
I also have
a flutter in my chest,

09:38.548 --> 09:39.814
like a hummingbird.

09:39.816 --> 09:42.083
Which is something
that a woman in my condition

09:42.085 --> 09:43.251
has to actually take seriously.

09:43.253 --> 09:44.886
You're referring to your s...

09:44.888 --> 09:46.787
wait.

09:49.791 --> 09:51.726
I hear two heartbeats.

09:51.728 --> 09:52.994
Maybe it's the stethoscope.

09:52.996 --> 09:55.530
[Whispers]
Maybe it's my two hearts.

09:55.532 --> 09:57.665
You had a heterotopic
heart transplant?

09:57.667 --> 10:00.368
Yes, but you shouldn't be able
to hear them both.

10:00.370 --> 10:01.569
They should beat as one.

10:01.571 --> 10:03.471
It's far more romantic
that way.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.540
[Chuckles]
Not to mention healthier.

10:05.542 --> 10:06.641
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:06.643 --> 10:10.311
I want to do an EKG.
Fun.

10:11.614 --> 10:14.616
Ugh, if I had a nickel
for every time I had an EKG,

10:14.618 --> 10:16.952
I would have
a metric butt load of nickels.

10:16.954 --> 10:18.286
[Chuckles]

10:18.288 --> 10:20.923
I was diagnosed with
cardiomyopathy nine years ago.

10:20.925 --> 10:22.524
Two years
on the transplant list,

10:22.526 --> 10:24.827
seven years
as a transplant patient.

10:24.829 --> 10:26.896
And a month after my surgery,

10:26.898 --> 10:30.567
I had to have an EKG
every other day.

10:30.569 --> 10:32.369
That's like 15 nickels
right there.

10:32.371 --> 10:33.637
I could probably do it myself,

10:33.639 --> 10:34.738
but I wouldn't be able
to read it.

10:34.740 --> 10:35.839
Well, let's see if I can.

10:35.841 --> 10:37.141
I've never done one
on two hearts.

10:37.143 --> 10:38.242
Yeah, I get that a lot.

10:38.244 --> 10:39.610
Why did your doctors
add a heart

10:39.612 --> 10:41.545
rather than perform
a replacement?

10:41.547 --> 10:43.346
They couldn't find
a perfect match,

10:43.348 --> 10:46.049
so they put in a second
to help mine pump.

10:46.051 --> 10:48.551
After the surgery,
I was "all heart,"

10:48.553 --> 10:51.254
so I decided to start
a matchmaking business.

10:51.256 --> 10:53.856
No one ever likes that joke,

10:53.858 --> 10:55.658
but feel free to be the first.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.627
It's all right.

10:57.629 --> 11:01.197
Uh, the complexes in one heart
appear normal,

11:01.199 --> 11:03.432
but the other shows
intermittent svt.

11:03.434 --> 11:06.102
Definitely wouldn't have
been able to read that.

11:06.104 --> 11:08.437
I'd like to take you
to a local specialist

11:08.439 --> 11:09.538
just to be safe.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.474
Ah, the life
of a transplant patient!

11:11.476 --> 11:13.042
The doctor will probably want
to look at your medications,

11:13.044 --> 11:14.243
so you should bring them.

11:14.245 --> 11:16.612
I hope you have a big backseat.

11:16.614 --> 11:18.447
She has a great attitude,
don't you think?

11:18.449 --> 11:19.849
Admirable.

11:19.851 --> 11:22.685
So it's her sense of humor
you don't care for?

11:22.687 --> 11:25.688
I saw you roll your eyes.
I did not roll my eyes.

11:25.690 --> 11:27.256
Div...

11:27.258 --> 11:29.458
Fine.

11:29.460 --> 11:32.661
I rolled my eyes.

11:32.663 --> 11:35.931
I have a problem
with her profession.

11:35.933 --> 11:38.367
My parents, they played
matchmaker with me and raj.

11:38.369 --> 11:41.636
It didn't matter
that we weren't in love...

11:41.638 --> 11:43.438
Real love...

11:43.440 --> 11:46.741
The kind you find without
third-party meddling.

11:46.743 --> 11:49.110
I tried to make them understand.
You see where it got me?

11:49.112 --> 11:50.545
Yeah, well, from the looks
of things this morning,

11:50.547 --> 11:51.813
it seems like
they're coming around.

11:51.815 --> 11:53.782
- Just my mother.
- It's a start.

11:53.784 --> 11:56.318
- She left my father.
- Wow.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.954
That's...
how do you feel?

11:58.956 --> 12:02.257
Honestly?
Responsible.

12:02.259 --> 12:03.659
Why would you be responsible?

12:03.661 --> 12:06.128
Hank, I encouraged her
to do it.

12:06.130 --> 12:09.065
I actually...
[Singsong] I'm ready!

12:09.067 --> 12:11.100
- Uh...
- Later.

12:11.102 --> 12:12.568
Okay.

12:19.242 --> 12:21.944
Boris.
Yeah. Hank.

12:21.946 --> 12:23.546
[Sighs]

12:26.850 --> 12:29.884
I'm not gonna apologize
for saving that man.

12:29.886 --> 12:32.320
I took an oath...
I know, I know.

12:32.322 --> 12:34.455
I have come to thank you.

12:34.457 --> 12:36.190
I acted emotionally last night

12:36.192 --> 12:39.127
out of concern for my family.

12:39.129 --> 12:40.361
Your family?

12:40.363 --> 12:42.596
The man was discovered

12:42.598 --> 12:44.332
under Carlos' bedroom window.

12:44.334 --> 12:47.201
I have no illusions
about what he was after.

12:47.203 --> 12:50.004
And with all you've witnessed
this summer, do you?

12:50.006 --> 12:52.540
You wanted him to die.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.809
I was angry, Hank.

12:54.811 --> 12:56.510
You know my family's history.

12:56.512 --> 12:59.446
I will not let it reach my son.

13:02.918 --> 13:05.152
But...

13:05.154 --> 13:07.288
I should have known asking you
to compromise your integrity

13:07.290 --> 13:09.891
would be...

13:09.893 --> 13:11.659
Futile.

13:13.228 --> 13:14.762
So thank you.

13:14.764 --> 13:16.731
You're welcome.

13:16.733 --> 13:20.701
I'm glad we can
put this ugly mess

13:20.703 --> 13:23.638
behind us now.

13:34.459 --> 13:36.359
Hi.

13:36.361 --> 13:37.794
Hi.

13:37.796 --> 13:40.864
Wow.

13:40.866 --> 13:42.265
What... what's all this?

13:42.267 --> 13:44.268
You have a crazy workload
today.

13:44.270 --> 13:45.803
I wanted you to be
properly fed.

13:45.805 --> 13:49.373
This is, uh...
this is totally unnecessary.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.075
It's very sweet, though.

13:51.077 --> 13:53.243
I get sweeter.

13:53.245 --> 13:55.846
I also copied the schedule
for all your doctors.

13:55.848 --> 13:58.114
Oh, and I got you
some extra phone chargers,

13:58.116 --> 14:00.083
so now you'll have one
for your house

14:00.085 --> 14:03.186
and one for your car
and one for my place.

14:03.188 --> 14:05.187
You are getting too many
important calls

14:05.189 --> 14:06.322
to run out of battery.

14:06.324 --> 14:09.424
Wow. That's amazing.

14:09.426 --> 14:11.659
You don't sound amazed.

14:11.661 --> 14:14.662
No, I mean, it's...

14:14.664 --> 14:20.368
okay, are you being
a little... Extra... Paigey?

14:20.370 --> 14:21.936
I don't know what that means.

14:21.938 --> 14:25.139
Like, you're always
very supportive, right?

14:25.141 --> 14:27.808
But after the muffins yesterday

14:27.810 --> 14:30.511
and the 90-minute
deep-tissue massage last night

14:30.513 --> 14:33.547
and now this, you're being
even more supportive than usual,

14:33.549 --> 14:35.916
which is already
maniacally supportive,

14:35.918 --> 14:40.454
so I can't help
but think something's off.

14:40.456 --> 14:42.089
Maybe it's you,

14:42.091 --> 14:44.658
because I am
the perfect amount of me.

14:44.660 --> 14:45.960
- Ah.
- And I had a brainstorm

14:45.962 --> 14:47.661
about yesterday's
staff meeting.

14:47.663 --> 14:51.065
The problem is that
the staff hasn't bonded.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.900
Oh. Well, babe,
it's a little early

14:52.902 --> 14:54.702
for a corporate retreat,
don't you think?

14:54.704 --> 14:56.404
I was gonna suggest a mixer.

14:56.406 --> 14:58.005
That's actually
a really good idea.

14:58.007 --> 14:59.373
But I can't...
I mean, I'm so...

14:59.375 --> 15:01.876
no, I know, you're busy.
But I can plan it.

15:01.878 --> 15:04.712
How are you
gonna have time for that?

15:04.714 --> 15:06.881
You've got art school
coming up in three weeks.

15:06.883 --> 15:08.883
You've gotta find a place...
It's under control.

15:08.885 --> 15:10.951
This is more important
right now.

15:10.953 --> 15:14.355
So what do you say?

15:14.357 --> 15:15.990
Yeah, it sounds perfect.

15:15.992 --> 15:17.692
Great.
I'm gonna get started.

15:17.694 --> 15:21.229
Excellent.
Mwah.

15:21.231 --> 15:23.699
Wait, after breakfast...
Paige?

15:31.375 --> 15:34.377
Dr. London found
that both your hearts

15:34.379 --> 15:35.512
are pumping adequately.

15:35.514 --> 15:37.580
That's good.

15:37.582 --> 15:39.349
Did I mention
that he's a client now?

15:39.351 --> 15:43.386
Brilliant cardiologist,
easy on the eyes.

15:43.388 --> 15:44.554
No, thank you.

15:44.556 --> 15:45.855
The tests also showed no signs

15:45.857 --> 15:47.957
of your body
rejecting the heart

15:47.959 --> 15:50.426
or any ischemic or valvular
heart disease.

15:50.428 --> 15:53.462
He did put a couple
of new pills in my regimen.

15:53.464 --> 15:57.167
Did I mention that he's also
interested in photography,

15:57.169 --> 16:00.036
fine wine, and iyengar yoga?

16:00.038 --> 16:03.407
I mean, I'd have to get
to know you first,

16:03.409 --> 16:05.742
but I have a really
good feeling about this.

16:05.744 --> 16:07.377
You know, Ms. Sullavan...
[Sighs]

16:07.379 --> 16:09.746
I am really not interested.

16:09.748 --> 16:12.048
Is that the only reason
that you called?

16:12.050 --> 16:14.585
No. I'm nauseous.

16:14.587 --> 16:15.986
I know that side effects
are side effects

16:15.988 --> 16:18.189
of most medications, but...

16:18.191 --> 16:20.825
Is there something
you can do about it?

16:20.827 --> 16:23.561
Well, let me confer
with Hank and Dr. London.

16:23.563 --> 16:26.530
Maybe there's something else
that we can give you.

16:26.532 --> 16:28.632
Most people don't think
matchmaking is for them,

16:28.634 --> 16:31.803
but then, once they try it...
I did!

16:31.805 --> 16:34.405
I did try it.

16:34.407 --> 16:35.874
You pair people up
simply because

16:35.876 --> 16:38.142
it looks good on paper.

16:38.144 --> 16:40.811
I believe in love.

16:40.813 --> 16:43.414
I believe in romance.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.883
I believe in something
real and lasting.

16:45.885 --> 16:47.752
These people are not
paper dolls to me.

16:47.754 --> 16:50.488
I get to know everything about
my clients, outside and in.

16:50.490 --> 16:53.424
I believe that's the only way
that you <i>can</i> find a match

16:53.426 --> 16:55.693
that's real and lasting.

16:55.695 --> 16:58.062
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

16:58.064 --> 17:00.965
No, I'm glad you did.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.868
Look, before my surgery,

17:02.870 --> 17:04.102
I was stuck
in a lousy marriage,

17:04.104 --> 17:05.671
I had a lousy job.

17:05.673 --> 17:07.872
I didn't believe in love.
I didn't believe in happiness.

17:07.874 --> 17:10.041
But then this woman
I didn't even know,

17:10.044 --> 17:11.542
she gave me her heart.

17:11.545 --> 17:15.114
I got a second chance at life.

17:15.116 --> 17:17.816
And I realized that lousy just
wasn't gonna cut it any more.

17:17.818 --> 17:19.451
I wanted to find
what made me happy,

17:19.453 --> 17:21.853
and it turns out
that helping other people

17:21.855 --> 17:25.156
find happiness, find love...
that makes me happy.

17:25.159 --> 17:29.095
I'm really good at it.

17:36.070 --> 17:38.071
How is the burglar?

17:38.073 --> 17:40.306
He's still in a coma
from the initial hypoxia,

17:40.308 --> 17:42.174
but his vitals are stable,
so we're hopeful.

17:42.176 --> 17:44.376
Oh, what did the police say?

17:44.378 --> 17:45.678
I haven't talked to them yet.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.246
Maybe Boris snuffed him out.

17:47.248 --> 17:48.514
I think that
would've made the news.

17:48.516 --> 17:49.682
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

17:49.684 --> 17:51.651
All right, that's it.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.021
Eddie doesn't want to meddle
in your lives, so I will.

17:55.023 --> 17:57.491
We think you should
move in with us.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.159
What?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.761
It's not safe at shadow pond.

18:00.763 --> 18:02.930
Even the name sounds shadowy.

18:02.932 --> 18:05.233
Ms. Newberg,
I think we're okay.

18:05.235 --> 18:07.703
We're surrounded by guards,
like, all the time.

18:07.705 --> 18:09.237
Guards who shoot people.

18:09.239 --> 18:10.939
Look, they were
defending Boris's family.

18:10.941 --> 18:11.974
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, that man

18:11.976 --> 18:13.342
pretended to be on an hvac crew

18:13.344 --> 18:17.846
so he could sneak
onto the property.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.683
- Dad? Dad, are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.685 --> 18:22.718
I think I'm good.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.520
Ms. Newberg, would you mind
getting dad's heart medicine?

18:24.522 --> 18:26.022
Yeah, they're
in the car, honey.

18:26.024 --> 18:29.292
Between interviews
for book publishers

18:29.294 --> 18:32.929
and now a shooting,
he's worn himself out.

18:32.931 --> 18:34.764
Yeah.

18:34.766 --> 18:37.267
We only made love once today.

18:37.269 --> 18:39.202
Thank you for sharing that.

18:39.204 --> 18:42.238
Mm.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.740
Be right back.

18:45.543 --> 18:47.377
Hvac did you just say hvac?

18:47.379 --> 18:49.112
You seem better.

18:49.114 --> 18:51.448
Yeah, I did.
What's wrong?

18:51.450 --> 18:52.816
Okay, you know what,
I wasn't going to say anything,

18:52.818 --> 18:55.218
because Hank told me
to stay out of Boris's life,

18:55.220 --> 18:57.019
and then Boris made
the same suggestion,

18:57.021 --> 18:58.387
but that was
before it happened.

18:58.389 --> 19:00.389
- Before what happened?
- Okay.

19:00.391 --> 19:02.291
I'm trying to give Boris
a copy of my book.

19:02.293 --> 19:04.427
He takes off.
Then all of a sudden,

19:04.429 --> 19:07.764
from out of the trees come
these guys with guns blazing.

19:07.766 --> 19:10.267
I'm telling you, they were
chasing down the driveway,

19:10.269 --> 19:12.335
trying to stop this hvac truck.

19:12.337 --> 19:15.238
It was like a spy movie thing.
Wait a sec.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.173
This is the day
before the break-in?

19:17.175 --> 19:19.142
Yes.

19:19.144 --> 19:21.578
They were holding him
a full day before they shot him?

19:21.580 --> 19:23.146
What the heck
were they doing to him?

19:23.148 --> 19:25.248
Relax, Evan, I don't think
that's what dad was saying.

19:25.250 --> 19:28.018
That is exactly
what dad is saying.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.819
Maybe they shot him
when he was trying to get away.

19:29.821 --> 19:31.121
Stay out of it, okay?

19:31.123 --> 19:34.457
Henry, the guy had
a shark tank in his basement.

19:34.459 --> 19:36.960
I mean, a torture chamber
wouldn't be out of the realm...

19:36.962 --> 19:39.463
Evan, we're staying
out of it.

19:45.937 --> 19:48.005
Oh, excuse me.
Hi. You made it.

19:48.007 --> 19:49.874
Of course.
You called.

19:49.876 --> 19:51.141
Are you not feeling okay?

19:51.143 --> 19:53.978
No, I'm fine.
Stop being such a doctor.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.680
I invited you to lunch,
so come on, let's eat.

19:56.682 --> 19:58.982
Actually, I just ate lunch.
When I got your message,

19:58.984 --> 20:01.218
I assumed it was
a medical appointment.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.620
You're a workaholic.

20:02.622 --> 20:04.722
That's what you suffer from,
workaholism.

20:04.724 --> 20:08.125
- Oh, is that your diagnosis?
- That's why you're single.

20:08.127 --> 20:10.394
I did some research
on you, Hank.

20:10.396 --> 20:11.395
Hi, Harper!

20:11.397 --> 20:13.197
- Hey.
- Harper, this is Hank.

20:13.199 --> 20:15.966
- Hi.
- Hank, Harper.

20:15.968 --> 20:17.434
Glad you guys
could join me for lunch.

20:17.436 --> 20:20.337
I actually hate eating alone.

20:20.339 --> 20:23.573
Oh, my gosh,
I think I see Nick Lachey.

20:23.575 --> 20:24.975
I'm gonna go say hi.

20:24.977 --> 20:29.079
See you guys later.
Okay.

20:29.081 --> 20:32.415
Gee, I, uh, wonder
if this is a setup.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.418
What do you expect
from a matchmaker?

20:34.420 --> 20:37.287
Yeah, I don't,
because I didn't hire her,

20:37.289 --> 20:39.056
but apparently
I've been drafted.

20:39.058 --> 20:42.759
So less a blind date,
more a blindside.

20:42.761 --> 20:45.262
[Laughs] Yeah, exactly.

20:45.264 --> 20:47.030
So what brought you
to Veronica?

20:47.032 --> 20:50.700
I wasn't having
a lot of dating luck myself,

20:50.702 --> 20:52.335
so I'm giving this a shot.

20:52.337 --> 20:54.170
Is anybody here a doctor?

20:54.172 --> 20:57.406
Both: I am.

20:57.408 --> 21:01.343
Excuse me, coming through!

21:01.345 --> 21:02.878
Veronica!

21:07.350 --> 21:09.951
No pulse.
Yeah.

21:13.701 --> 21:15.201
Both: I need a defibrillator.

21:15.203 --> 21:16.904
You bag her,
I'll do compressions.

21:16.906 --> 21:19.006
Just so you know, she had
a heterotopic heart transplant.

21:19.008 --> 21:22.443
Two hearts.
Good to know.

21:22.445 --> 21:24.512
One and two
and three and four...

21:24.514 --> 21:26.414
An ambulance is on its way.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.749
Okay, take over for me.
Thank you.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.684
[Under breath] Six, seven...

21:30.686 --> 21:32.520
What's the matter?
It's not working.

21:32.522 --> 21:34.121
- But it's brand new.
- Well, it...

21:34.123 --> 21:37.191
- take over for me.
- Okay.

21:37.193 --> 21:38.426
I need a knife.

21:38.428 --> 21:39.427
You're gonna cut her
open right here?

21:39.429 --> 21:40.461
Get me a knife now.

21:40.463 --> 21:42.430
- [Groans]
- One, two,

21:42.432 --> 21:47.235
three, four,
and five, and six...

21:47.237 --> 21:48.303
All right,
she's not responding.

21:48.305 --> 21:49.571
I'm gonna do
a precordial thump.

21:49.573 --> 21:51.306
[Grunts]

21:51.308 --> 21:52.474
Wait, wait,
what are you doing to her?

21:52.476 --> 21:54.208
It can cause
an electrical discharge

21:54.210 --> 21:55.576
which can put her back
into normal rhythm.

21:55.578 --> 21:58.579
[Grunts] Mm...

21:58.581 --> 22:01.783
By the way, it helps to have
the plastic off the battery.

22:01.785 --> 22:04.385
Now it's working.
Nice.

22:04.387 --> 22:07.255
[Gasps]

22:07.257 --> 22:09.290
- Nice.
- Veronica?

22:09.292 --> 22:11.926
You went into cardiac arrest,

22:11.928 --> 22:13.361
but your hearts
are beating again.

22:13.363 --> 22:14.796
Now we need to get you
to the hospital.

22:14.798 --> 22:17.098
It's gonna be okay.

22:20.236 --> 22:24.406
[Typing quickly]

22:29.780 --> 22:31.347
[Object clattering on table]

22:31.349 --> 22:34.884
- Early wedding planning?
- Ah ha ha.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.955
Giant Hankmed launch party
planning, actually.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.423
Paige went rogue.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.761
- Does Hank...
- Nope.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.329
- You know the last thing he...
- Yep.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.431
- He's not gonna like...
- Oh, I know.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.800
Can I please
finish my sentence?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.635
He's already anxious about
the expansion of Hankmed,

22:50.637 --> 22:52.203
and after that horrendous
first staff meeting...

22:52.205 --> 22:53.805
yes.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.840
I would've had the same thought,
if you'd let me complete it.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.709
[Phone chimes]

22:57.711 --> 23:00.712
Okay, maybe you could...

23:00.714 --> 23:03.014
Strategically place
the flowers around the house,

23:03.016 --> 23:04.683
and Hank wouldn't notice them.

23:04.685 --> 23:07.319
He wouldn't notice them?

23:07.321 --> 23:08.654
It's like the poppy field

23:08.656 --> 23:10.689
from <i>the wizard of oz</i>
<i>in here, Divya.</i>

23:10.691 --> 23:12.191
Look, it's...
[Scoffs]

23:12.193 --> 23:13.325
[Sighs]

23:13.327 --> 23:14.493
Then you'll have
to be honest with him.

23:14.495 --> 23:16.062
[Door closes]

23:16.064 --> 23:17.396
Oh, God.
Well, it looks like

23:17.398 --> 23:18.931
you're going to get
your wish, Divya.

23:18.933 --> 23:20.566
It'll be all right.
I'll back you up.

23:20.568 --> 23:21.968
No. I'll handle it.

23:21.970 --> 23:23.903
You guys haven't set a date

23:23.905 --> 23:25.404
and you're already
picking flowers?

23:25.406 --> 23:26.472
All right.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.744
What...?

23:31.746 --> 23:33.479
[Clears throat]

23:33.481 --> 23:35.881
Paige invited 300 people
to the Hankmed launch party.

23:35.883 --> 23:37.183
Give or take.

23:37.185 --> 23:38.684
I'm sorry, did you just say
"launch party"?

23:38.686 --> 23:41.988
- Hank, it's not Evan's fault...
- Bugger off, Divya.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.426
[Chuckles] Thank you.

23:46.428 --> 23:47.493
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll be going.

23:47.495 --> 23:49.195
Byebye.
Launch party?

23:49.197 --> 23:51.897
I know, I know, it ballooned
into something unwieldy.

23:51.899 --> 23:54.400
- 300 people.
- Give or take, okay?

23:54.402 --> 23:56.736
Give or take.
I would've shut it down,

23:56.738 --> 23:58.604
but that would've meant
shutting Paige down,

23:58.606 --> 24:01.441
and for God knows what reason,
she seems to really need this.

24:01.443 --> 24:03.710
She needs a party
for 300 people?

24:03.712 --> 24:06.246
I know, give or take.
Look, Hank,

24:06.248 --> 24:08.115
something's going on with her,
and I don't know what it is,

24:08.117 --> 24:10.017
because she won't admit that
something's going on with her,

24:10.019 --> 24:12.120
so I'm...
[Stammers]

24:12.122 --> 24:14.222
I'm gonna shut it down.
I'll shut it down.

24:14.224 --> 24:16.457
No.
No, no, no.

24:16.459 --> 24:21.830
Evan... Don't shut it down.

24:21.832 --> 24:23.765
- Really?
- Really.

24:23.767 --> 24:26.402
We'll have a big launch party.

24:26.404 --> 24:30.272
Why don't you look relieved?

24:30.274 --> 24:33.475
Because... What if this
relaunch party doesn't fix her?

24:33.477 --> 24:35.477
Like, what if...
what if this party's

24:35.479 --> 24:37.946
just like a gateway party
into even bigger parties,

24:37.948 --> 24:40.248
like celebrations and galas?

24:40.250 --> 24:41.583
Then you'll be there for her,

24:41.585 --> 24:46.088
just like she'll always be
there for you.

24:46.090 --> 24:50.325
For the record,
I like this one.

24:50.327 --> 24:52.428
It does that.

25:08.847 --> 25:10.748
I was told
the John Doe was here.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.783
He was.
He's being transferred.

25:12.785 --> 25:15.285
- Transferred where?
- Got me.

25:15.287 --> 25:16.753
How long ago did they take him?

25:16.755 --> 25:17.988
Just happened.

25:17.990 --> 25:19.189
They might still be
in the ambulance bay.

25:19.191 --> 25:22.659
- Okay.
- Why?

25:22.661 --> 25:24.127
Okay.

25:27.065 --> 25:29.333
Excuse me,
where are you taking him?

25:29.335 --> 25:33.204
I-I-I'm a doctor.
I said, I'm a doctor.

25:33.206 --> 25:35.140
This patient just
had open heart surgery.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.542
Hey, why is he being moved?

25:37.544 --> 25:40.478
Ask dispatch. All I know is
I've got the transfer papers.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.481
This is unit 547, transporting
patient to foxtrot Mike.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.458
Well, there isn't
much difference

25:54.460 --> 25:55.826
between the past
and the present, then,

25:55.828 --> 25:59.130
if I can't control it,
is there?

25:59.132 --> 26:02.200
I see. Yeah.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.401
Good, then, do it!

26:03.403 --> 26:07.038
[Both speaking german]

26:07.040 --> 26:09.908
Okay.
You seem troubled, Hank.

26:09.910 --> 26:11.943
I'm confused.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.645
All right, you tell me, then.
Good.

26:14.647 --> 26:16.881
The John Doe was moved,

26:16.883 --> 26:19.384
I'm pretty sure
by the government.

26:19.386 --> 26:20.718
Why would you say that?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.620
Well, the paramedics
who put him in the ambulance

26:22.622 --> 26:25.322
said they were taking him
to "foxtrot Mike."

26:25.324 --> 26:26.924
Last I checked,
New York paramedics

26:26.926 --> 26:30.227
don't use phonetic alphabets.

26:30.229 --> 26:32.829
[Scoffs]

26:32.831 --> 26:34.832
Very good, Hank.
[Glasses clatter]

26:34.834 --> 26:37.334
Very good.

26:37.336 --> 26:42.172
You see, "foxtrot Mike"
is fort Meade.

26:42.174 --> 26:46.242
The NSA has taken
your John Doe.

26:46.244 --> 26:48.243
He wasn't shot
breaking in, was he?

26:48.245 --> 26:49.912
He was shot breaking out.

26:49.914 --> 26:52.247
I had assumed we had put this
in the past, yes?

26:52.249 --> 26:56.518
I don't like being lied to.

26:56.520 --> 27:01.956
This man was caught
planting listening devices.

27:01.958 --> 27:04.959
You understand?
Bugs, everywhere in my house.

27:04.961 --> 27:07.729
I am hosting a meeting
in the near future,

27:07.731 --> 27:10.198
to which it seems some parties
would like to be privy.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.367
So this had nothing to do
with the safety of your son.

27:12.369 --> 27:15.570
Who knows what else
he was going to do?

27:15.572 --> 27:17.538
These are
dangerous people, Hank.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.240
They do dangerous things.

27:19.242 --> 27:22.110
Why didn't you just tell me?

27:22.112 --> 27:26.514
I assumed you...
Wouldn't want to be involved.

27:26.516 --> 27:27.715
Hank, in your profession,

27:27.717 --> 27:30.117
you see a problem
and you treat it, yeah?

27:30.119 --> 27:31.786
It is a controlled environment.

27:31.788 --> 27:33.888
Everything is primarily
black or white.

27:33.890 --> 27:39.427
For me...
Not so simple.

27:42.698 --> 27:44.065
[Speaking foreign language]

27:51.008 --> 27:52.557
I've read about a patient
with two hearts,

27:52.677 --> 27:55.078
but I've never had
a chance to work on one.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.980
We had to get
a specially modified pacemaker

27:56.982 --> 27:58.715
with two leads.
Unbelievable.

27:58.717 --> 28:00.784
Yeah, I know,
it's very exciting stuff.

28:00.786 --> 28:03.119
Veronica has
a temperature of 100.5.

28:03.121 --> 28:05.188
I mean, she may be fighting
some type of infection.

28:05.190 --> 28:08.225
It's a slight fever, but
her arrhythmia's more pressing.

28:08.227 --> 28:09.593
Both of her hearts
need pacemakers,

28:09.595 --> 28:15.365
or she's staring at
another cardiac arrest.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.133
What is it?

28:17.135 --> 28:19.603
I think there's more to this
than Veronica's hearts.

28:19.605 --> 28:21.004
Now, you said she had nausea.

28:21.006 --> 28:23.339
- And now a fever.
- When I saw her at the club,

28:23.341 --> 28:25.642
she was wearing
sunglasses inside.

28:25.644 --> 28:26.877
And when we first went
to her house,

28:26.879 --> 28:28.645
a lot of the shades were drawn.
Mmhmm.

28:28.647 --> 28:29.813
Do you think she's photophobic?

28:29.815 --> 28:31.047
Conditions that present

28:31.049 --> 28:33.316
with both arrhythmias
and photophobia...

28:33.318 --> 28:36.119
- Q fever.
- Typhoid.

28:36.121 --> 28:39.289
Veronica!

28:39.291 --> 28:43.894
Here, get her feet.
I've got the line.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.228
Easy, easy.

28:45.230 --> 28:48.065
Get me 2 milligrams
of lorazepam.

28:48.067 --> 28:49.499
I'll get her on oxygen.

28:49.501 --> 28:52.669
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Seizure's subsiding.

29:00.178 --> 29:05.549
Hey, welcome back.
What happened?

29:05.551 --> 29:06.850
You had a seizure.

29:06.852 --> 29:08.585
I'm gonna call neuro
for a consult.

29:08.587 --> 29:11.221
But we will have to postpone
your pacemaker surgery.

29:11.223 --> 29:15.792
[Scoffs]
Don't sound so disappointed.

29:15.794 --> 29:18.261
Don't you have other
defected hearted patients?

29:18.263 --> 29:20.763
First we need to figure out
what's going on with you.

29:20.765 --> 29:23.666
[Weakly] Yay, I'm special.

29:23.668 --> 29:25.601
I'll be back
to check in on you.

29:25.603 --> 29:27.036
Thank you.

29:27.038 --> 29:30.273
Veronica, your seizure,
along with your other symptoms,

29:30.275 --> 29:32.709
may be signs of
an underlying condition.

29:32.711 --> 29:34.411
What?

29:34.413 --> 29:36.613
Has the light
been bothering your eyes?

29:36.615 --> 29:39.883
They've been sensitive.

29:39.885 --> 29:41.585
Like a flash like when you...

29:41.587 --> 29:43.587
Open the curtains
in the morning.

29:43.589 --> 29:45.722
That's called photophobia.
It's a symptom, too.

29:45.724 --> 29:48.892
- Of what?
- Hank, take a look at this.

29:48.894 --> 29:52.029
- What?
- It's petechial rash.

29:52.031 --> 29:53.363
What is it?

29:53.365 --> 29:56.033

41:16.777 --> 41:18.811
Please sit down.

41:18.813 --> 41:22.514
[Clears throat] No.

41:22.516 --> 41:24.951
Do you really want to know?

41:24.953 --> 41:29.055
Yeah, I do.

41:29.057 --> 41:30.427
Perhaps my assumption
about you was wrong.

41:30.465 --> 41:32.286
Perhaps you are not so predictable.

41:32.887 --> 41:35.382
You've been very generous to me.
And to Evan.

41:35.589 --> 41:37.166
You opened your home to us.

41:37.286 --> 41:40.312
Gave me credibility when no one
out here had any idea who I was.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.697
You're right, my world is black
and white.

41:42.817 --> 41:43.983
Yours isn't.

41:44.227 --> 41:47.128
But I always assumed we were more
alike than different.

41:48.706 --> 41:50.274
Now I'm starting to wonder.

41:51.238 --> 41:53.717
Okay, if I'm gonna work with you, I need
to be sure

41:53.754 --> 41:55.773
it doesn't make me a part of
something I don't believe in.

41:59.537 --> 42:01.011
Then find out.

42:01.706 --> 42:02.504
How?

42:02.767 --> 42:04.185
I need your help.

42:06.551 --> 42:08.532
Would you be interested in joining me in an
adventure.

42:10.546 --> 42:11.673
I'm listening.
