WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:12.500 --> 01:14.083
Pooh: Oh, bother.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.708
Oof!

01:21.958 --> 01:23.583
Ouch!

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Why, this is perfect.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.083
Piglet will know just what
to do with whatever this is.

01:44.083 --> 01:48.583
And when he figures it out,
we'll be even better friends.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.458
- Tigger: Nah,
it's gotta be higher.
- Rabbit: No, lower.

01:53.458 --> 01:56.458
- Nah, over here.
- No, over here.

01:56.458 --> 01:58.958
D-D-Don't you think
it should be over--

01:58.958 --> 02:01.333
Piglet, my friend,
it belongs right here.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.166
No, Piglet, it belongs
on this wall.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.708
But the light's
all wrong there.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.875
Yeah? Well, the dark's
all wrong over there.

02:07.875 --> 02:11.166
- Oh! Watch out!
-

02:11.166 --> 02:14.125
- Come in.

02:14.125 --> 02:18.750
Hello, Piglet,
my very best friend.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.125
Why, hello, Pooh Bear.

02:21.125 --> 02:26.333
That is a very interesting shirt
you're wearing today.

02:26.333 --> 02:30.583
E-E-Excuse me, Pooh,
but what's that?

02:30.583 --> 02:35.166
Oh! This is a surprise
for you.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.875
Surprise!

02:38.458 --> 02:41.000
It's a friendship gift.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Why, thank you, very much, Pooh.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.500
You're very welcome, Piglet.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.875
A friendship gift?

02:48.875 --> 02:50.208
Well, well!

02:50.208 --> 02:52.125
That's very thoughtful
of Pooh.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.458
Ooh!

02:53.458 --> 02:55.375
Very considerable,
I'm sure.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.708
Uh, what'd you give him?

02:57.708 --> 02:59.083
Why, nothing.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.208
Nothing?

03:01.208 --> 03:05.166
Oh, no. Pooh doesn't expect me
to give him anything.

03:05.166 --> 03:09.000
All the more reason
to give him something grand.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.416
Oh, dear.

03:11.875 --> 03:14.375
You just don't understand,
Piglet.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.166
The gift has to be
from the heart.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.500
But Pooh loves honey
more than anything,

03:19.500 --> 03:22.416
and his tummy is very close
to his heart.

03:22.416 --> 03:24.625
It just ain't enough, kiddo.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.875
If you're determined to show
Pooh how much you like him,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.708
by giving him honey--

03:29.708 --> 03:31.625
Then you gotta give him
lots of honey.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.875
But this is all
the honey I have.

03:34.875 --> 03:37.083
- Not to worry.
-

03:37.083 --> 03:38.416
You just stick with us.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.333
Tigger:
Great idea, bunny boy!

03:43.333 --> 03:46.000
We'll get Piglet's honey
straight from the bee's mouth.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.375
- How's you ever think of it?
- Oh, it was simple.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.416
I just thought like a bear.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.208
Um, e-e-excuse me,

03:53.208 --> 03:55.250
but one of the bees
won't give me any honey.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.708
Just ask them nicely.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.500
Do we have to do
everything for him?

04:03.416 --> 04:04.583
King me.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.250
Hut, two, three!

04:06.250 --> 04:08.125
Hut, two, three.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.583
Hut, two, three.

04:11.458 --> 04:14.250
- Halt!
- F-F-For you.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.708
For me? Oh!

04:20.416 --> 04:22.000
Oh.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.875
- Oh!
-

04:25.208 --> 04:27.000
Honey for Pooh!

04:37.833 --> 04:40.166
Uh-oh!

04:40.166 --> 04:43.291
Aren't you forgetting something?

04:43.291 --> 04:45.291
W-W-What?

04:45.291 --> 04:49.000
The honeypot, the honeypot.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, d-d-dear.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.250
Yow!

04:53.833 --> 04:55.750
Oh, m-m-my.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.166
How should we get
Pooh's present now?

04:59.875 --> 05:02.125
No problem, Piglet!

05:02.125 --> 05:04.166
We'll just think like a bear.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.708
We'll borrow some.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.583
Honey, boy?

05:07.583 --> 05:09.958
- Left, left.
- A little more to the right.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.291
Maybe it was
a little more to the left.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.458
I think you're right.

05:17.458 --> 05:18.708
No, left.

05:37.208 --> 05:40.000
Tigger: Okay, ten pots
from Kanga. Check.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.875
Seven from Rabbit. Check.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.083
One yo-yo from Roo?

05:44.083 --> 05:45.875
Yech! Uncheck.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.250
Okay, any more honey,
bunny boy?

05:48.250 --> 05:49.625
Ha-ha! VoilÃ !

05:53.250 --> 05:55.208
Oh!

05:55.208 --> 05:57.000
My!

05:58.500 --> 06:00.833
Oh, dear.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.166
I've ruined Pooh's
friendship gift.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.208
What am I going to do now?

06:06.208 --> 06:08.708
The only thing to do, Piglet.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.583
Get more honey.

06:10.583 --> 06:14.416
Where am I gonna get more honey?
It's all broken.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.333
That's easy!

06:16.333 --> 06:19.000
The land of milk and honey.

06:20.708 --> 06:23.875
My mum used to read
to me about that place

06:23.875 --> 06:25.458
when I was just a kitten.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.375
But where do we find
this magical place?

06:28.375 --> 06:31.416
Why, in the jungle, Piglet.

06:31.416 --> 06:35.458
We just follow the trail
of the most dangerous
adventures.

06:35.458 --> 06:39.500
Uh, must we have
dangerous adventures?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.250
Oh, posilutely!

06:41.250 --> 06:43.375
How else do we know we're headed
in the right direction.

06:43.375 --> 06:46.416
You're right!
We leave at dawn.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.583
- Well, which way do we go?
- Together: That way!

06:51.583 --> 06:54.291
But that's where
all the jungle seems to be.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.416
He's right.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.500
Let's go!

06:58.708 --> 07:01.000
to wherever we're going

07:01.000 --> 07:02.750
here nor there

07:02.750 --> 07:05.458
we're certain to find

07:05.458 --> 07:08.500
- That's right, bunny boy!

07:08.500 --> 07:11.750
to hither or tither or yon

07:11.750 --> 07:13.708
that perfect reward

07:16.083 --> 07:19.000
like Pooh did for you

07:19.000 --> 07:21.416
anything you wouldn't do

07:21.416 --> 07:23.416
you wouldn't go

07:23.416 --> 07:25.458
to show

07:25.458 --> 07:27.708
-

07:27.708 --> 07:30.458
-

07:30.458 --> 07:32.958
-

07:32.958 --> 07:34.625
for a friend

07:34.625 --> 07:37.291
for a friend

07:45.166 --> 07:47.833
and even thin

07:47.833 --> 07:50.458
you'd jump right in

07:50.458 --> 07:53.125
-

07:53.125 --> 07:55.333
for a friend

07:55.333 --> 07:57.333
-

07:57.333 --> 08:00.208
for a friend

08:02.125 --> 08:05.708
Oh, stop! Stop!
I can't take it anymore!

08:08.166 --> 08:10.166
You guys are a riot!

08:10.166 --> 08:13.166
Hey, what's the big idea,
scaring us like that?

08:15.625 --> 08:17.958
You're the funniest thing
I've ever seen.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.833
Does this suit come
with two pair of pants?

08:26.625 --> 08:28.833
Looks just dandy to me.

08:30.583 --> 08:33.583
This animule's one taco short
of a combination plate.

08:33.583 --> 08:37.458
Let me talk to him.
I have a way with strangers.

08:37.458 --> 08:40.083
Now there, could you tell us

08:40.083 --> 08:44.333
the way to the land
of milk and honey?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.000
Say that again!

08:49.708 --> 08:52.583
I said, could you tell us

08:52.583 --> 08:57.083
the way to the land
of milk and honey?

09:04.416 --> 09:06.166
The land of milk and honey!

09:06.166 --> 09:07.958
The land of milk and honey!

09:07.958 --> 09:09.333
Heee!

09:12.583 --> 09:15.125
This is-- This is too much!

09:15.125 --> 09:20.000
Don't worry, Rabbit.
We'll find somebody else to ask.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.291
Yeah, someone with
a little less sense of humor.

09:24.875 --> 09:29.208
Piglet! Yoo-hoo! It's me!

09:29.208 --> 09:31.583
Perhaps he's hiding
in the cupboard.

09:37.708 --> 09:40.583
That's odd.
No Piglet.

09:40.583 --> 09:43.250
I shall just have
a little smackerel

09:43.250 --> 09:45.583
of something till he returns.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.416
He'd want me to.

09:47.416 --> 09:50.500
No honey?

09:55.125 --> 09:58.000
No honey,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.583
no Piglet,

09:59.583 --> 10:02.416
and no honey.

10:02.416 --> 10:03.708
Hmm.

10:03.708 --> 10:06.458
Something strange is going on.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.291
But we must ask directions.

10:10.291 --> 10:13.416
Yeah, remember what happened
when you asked old laughing boy.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.416
That was a hyena.

10:15.416 --> 10:17.583
This is a band of monkeys.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.750
One and two--

10:18.750 --> 10:20.458
Excuse me.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.625
Could I ask you something?

10:22.625 --> 10:24.708
Sure! You have a request?

10:24.708 --> 10:27.583
Chattanooga Choo-Choo?
Ludwig's Fifth?

10:27.583 --> 10:29.875
Hey! How about "The Last
Train to Clarksville"?

10:29.875 --> 10:31.583
We can do it all, you know.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.208
Listen! One and two!

10:34.208 --> 10:37.500
-

10:37.500 --> 10:39.958
No, wait!
All I want to know is

10:39.958 --> 10:43.250
how to find the land
of milk and honey!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.208
Did you say

10:47.208 --> 10:49.750
the land of milk and honey?

10:49.750 --> 10:51.583
Why, yes.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.125
Take five!

11:00.375 --> 11:01.708
Oh! Ouch!

11:03.291 --> 11:05.000
The land of milk and honey!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.625
The land of milk and honey!

11:08.333 --> 11:11.291
An A-flat.

11:11.291 --> 11:14.833
The place you're looking for
is under the volcano.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.583
Yeah, we should have known.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.125
These adventures always
got volcanoes in them.

11:19.125 --> 11:22.458
Mmm! Smells sweet.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.000
Look!

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
The land of milk and honey!

11:39.875 --> 11:41.625
And I say we tunnel in.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.375
- It's the only way.
- E-E-Excuse me.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.875
And I say we catapults
over the walls.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.000
- Excuse me, please?
- No, not now, Piglet.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.333
Can't you see we're deciding
the best way inside?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.458
Yes, and that way's tunneling.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.166
No, it's catapulting.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.708
Why don't we just knock?

12:00.166 --> 12:02.625
After you, Tigger.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.166
Oh, no, no, no, after you.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
Say, that's quite a doorbell.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.458
Oh, boy!
They must really hate salesmen.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.875
Suddenly,
getting honey for Pooh

12:30.875 --> 12:34.000
doesn't seem
like such a good idea.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.625
I propose we go home.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.333
And I second it, too.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.625
Please be f-f-friendly.

12:50.708 --> 12:52.583
Cannibals!

12:52.583 --> 12:55.291
Say something, Rabbit.

12:55.291 --> 12:59.083
Me? This was Piglet's idea.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.291
What?

13:00.291 --> 13:01.625
-

13:01.625 --> 13:03.708
I've got a--

13:03.708 --> 13:06.000
I've got a whatever it is,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.875
and I'm not afraid to use it.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.750
Hey! That's no cannibal!

13:13.750 --> 13:15.250
It's a pygmy piglet!

13:15.250 --> 13:18.875
Ooh! Ooh!
Come on out, everyone.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.708
Oh, Great One,
you have brought the pygmies

13:30.708 --> 13:32.583
the sacred pigtail.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.708
You mean this?

13:34.708 --> 13:38.458
Your people thank you
for returning this gift.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.000
Together: His people?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.708
Oh, yes.

13:42.708 --> 13:45.166
He is our king.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.458
I am?

13:48.166 --> 13:49.375
He am!

13:51.708 --> 13:53.458
But I don't wanna be king.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.208
I just wanna get some honey
for Pooh and go home.

13:55.208 --> 13:58.000
Oh, don't be silly, Piglet.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.583
Your people will give you
anything you want.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.958
And 'cause we're
your bestest buddies,

14:03.958 --> 14:06.000
they'll give us
anything we want, too.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.125
So don't be so hasty,
Your Harness.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.750
But I don't know how to be king.
Maybe we should just go--

14:11.750 --> 14:15.000
Nonsense!
You're the perfect ruler.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.083
Besides, we'll do
all the talking for you.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.000
Sure! I'll be
your prime minister,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
and Rabbit here will be
your chamber maid.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.166
Chamberlain.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.208
Hail, oh, Great One.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.208
Are you ready to return
the sacred tail

14:27.208 --> 14:29.708
to its rightful place?

14:29.708 --> 14:33.250
Only then will our precious
honey flow once more.

14:33.250 --> 14:36.250
You mean you want me
to give up my present for Pooh?

14:36.250 --> 14:40.875
Well, that is,
if you don't mind.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.583
Speaking for the Great One,

14:43.583 --> 14:48.416
the Prime Minister and I
just want to say--

14:48.416 --> 14:50.875
He's just busting
to help you.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.000
B-B-But...

15:24.583 --> 15:28.458
How will I tell Pooh that
I lost the present he gave me?

15:28.458 --> 15:31.625
Don't worry. We can always get
it back when no one's looking.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.000
Just relax and act kingy.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.458
All I wanted was
a little honey for Pooh.

15:38.875 --> 15:39.958
Pooh: Rabbit!

15:39.958 --> 15:41.708
Are you home, Rabbit?

15:43.625 --> 15:45.833
Rabbit?

15:45.833 --> 15:49.583
It's not like him to be
un-at home at lunchtime.

15:49.583 --> 15:53.333
This is getting very suspicious.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.083
Oops!

16:03.166 --> 16:06.625
Just as I feared,
no Rabbit...

16:06.625 --> 16:08.708
and no honey!

16:08.708 --> 16:10.958
Just like at Piglet's.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.000
Honeynapper tracks!

16:15.458 --> 16:17.500
I must get back to my house

16:17.500 --> 16:19.333
before they get all the honey

16:19.333 --> 16:21.125
in the Hundred Acre Woods.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.333
Please, you really
don't have to do that.

16:25.333 --> 16:29.708
But you have started the honey
flowing again, oh, Mighty One.

16:29.708 --> 16:31.958
We owe you everything.

16:34.458 --> 16:35.708
Excuse me.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.000
Have you seen Rabbit
and Piglet,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.166
my prime minister
and chamberlain?

16:40.166 --> 16:43.875
Now, aren't you all just
itching to learn how to bounce?

16:43.875 --> 16:49.000
Uh, not really, Prime Minister.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.625
We have chores to do.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.500
Oh, nuts.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.416
Oh, wait a minute,
I just remembered!

16:55.416 --> 16:58.708
The King told me that these
lessons are more important.

16:58.708 --> 17:01.458
Yeah, that's what he said.
Yeah, yeah.

17:01.458 --> 17:04.625
Oh, well, in that case--

17:04.625 --> 17:07.458
Great! Okay, troops,
now watch me.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.875
Bounce, two, three, four!

17:09.875 --> 17:11.833
Bounce, two, three, four!

17:11.833 --> 17:13.875
The King just told me

17:13.875 --> 17:18.250
that he was very upset
that you grow carrots here.

17:18.250 --> 17:22.416
So as your Chamberlain,
I say hands on the hoe.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.500
Eyes on the row.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.750
Now, plant, two, three, four.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.583
Plant, two, three, four.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.458
Wonderful, three, four.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.291
Wonderful!

17:32.291 --> 17:34.583
- Oh, my.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.000
Tigger, no!

17:40.750 --> 17:44.875
Look what you did
to the King's carrot garden.

17:44.875 --> 17:49.000
Well, the King told me
that bouncin' was more
important than carrots.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.750
- He did not.
- He did so.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.083
- He did not.
- Uh-uh, did so.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.708
- Did not.
- Did so.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.875
- Did not.
- Did so.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.708
Oh, my!
This isn't right at all!

18:07.583 --> 18:09.708
Wonderful!

18:09.708 --> 18:11.458
Absolutely wonderful!

18:11.458 --> 18:13.083
At this rate,

18:13.083 --> 18:15.458
my statue will be done
before Tigger's.

18:15.458 --> 18:18.291
What are you doing, Rabbit?

18:18.291 --> 18:21.000
Why, having my statue made.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.291
I told them you wanted one made
of your favorite chamberlain.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.625
Me! I knew you wouldn't mind.

18:26.625 --> 18:32.125
And, of course,
I told them you wanted one
of the Prime Minister, too.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.625
But I don't want any statues.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.458
Shh! They don't know that.

18:35.458 --> 18:38.000
They love doing things for you.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.875
But people should do nice
things for their friends

18:40.875 --> 18:43.458
not 'cause they have to,

18:43.458 --> 18:45.833
but because they want to.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.458
You're not being
very good friends.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.000
- I think it's time to go home.
- Right.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.708
I'll just get Piglet's present.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.708
I think I just did
a major uh-oh.

19:06.958 --> 19:10.583
You've broken the sacred tail.

19:14.958 --> 19:19.500
The volcano has erupted.
Please help us, oh, Great One.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.750
M-m-me?

19:21.750 --> 19:24.000
But we need you.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.166
You're right,
I should speak for myself.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.625
I may be little,
but the pygmies look up to me.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.250
Follow me.

19:40.583 --> 19:41.958
I said, follow me.

19:44.833 --> 19:48.625
You tear down that statue,
and you tear down that one.

19:48.625 --> 19:52.708
But we're such
very small animals.

19:52.708 --> 19:57.416
Even very small animals
must stand up for what's right.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.708
Hooray! Oh, boy!

20:13.708 --> 20:16.208
Yippee! Wow!

20:19.500 --> 20:20.875
Well, what do you know?

20:20.875 --> 20:23.458
Piglet really is
the great one after all.

20:24.583 --> 20:27.208
Guard, guard, guard, guard.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.000
Guard, guard, guard, guard.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.583
- Honeynappers!

20:32.583 --> 20:34.583
They shall not pass.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.125
Who goes there?

20:37.125 --> 20:40.708
Piglet: It's us--
me, Rabbit, and Tigger.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.208
It is?

20:44.708 --> 20:46.375
Wait.

20:46.375 --> 20:50.291
How do I know it's me,
Rabbit, and Tigger...

20:50.291 --> 20:53.458
and not honeynappers?

20:55.708 --> 21:00.875
I said, how do I know
it's me, Rabbit, and Tig--

21:02.958 --> 21:05.458
Hiya, buddy bear.
Did you miss us?

21:05.458 --> 21:08.833
Oh, hello, Tigger.

21:08.833 --> 21:12.458
How did you get past
my honeynapper traps?

21:12.458 --> 21:15.333
- Your backdoor was open.
- Pooh: Oh.

21:17.166 --> 21:20.750
Oh, why, Pooh Bear,
you're all out of honey.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.875
No, Piglet.
I cleverly put it

21:23.875 --> 21:25.958
where it's safe
from honeynappers.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.458
Right in here.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.833
Sometimes, Pooh Bear,
you really amaze me.

21:30.833 --> 21:33.125
Thank you, Rabbit.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.000
Pooh, as a token
of my friendship,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.458
I'd like--

21:38.458 --> 21:40.708
Here.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.625
Oh, Piglet,

21:42.625 --> 21:45.000
you didn't have
to get me anything.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.458
Your friendship is enough.

21:47.458 --> 21:50.125
Oh, thank you, Pooh.

21:50.125 --> 21:54.291
But I'd hate to see it
go to waste.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.208
Oh, it won't, Pooh.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.750
It won't.
