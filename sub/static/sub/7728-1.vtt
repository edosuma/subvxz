Father, everything's relative.

06:06.326 --> 06:07.618
Is it?

06:09.162 --> 06:10.997
Or, maybe not.

06:11.164 --> 06:13.124

Yes, I did.

Father, isn't he the one who--

06:30.516 --> 06:31.184
Yes.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.977
Died in a fall on those steps?

06:33.394 --> 06:34.270
Yes, that's right, Tim.

07:19.732 --> 07:20.441
Oh, yes.

07:23.403 --> 07:24.404
"Jesus loves you.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.114

you're an asshole."

Good morning, John.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.743

07:33.955 --> 07:35.206
Any plans today, Joe?

07:35.415 --> 07:36.874

07:39.877 --> 07:41.129

07:41.379 --> 07:43.339
That's commendable.

07:43.548 --> 07:44.924

Kinderman with me.

07:52.723 --> 07:53.599

07:53.808 --> 07:54.559
Yeah.

07:55.643 --> 07:56.727
Yeah, every,

07:56.936 --> 07:58.521
every year on this
day he gets depressed,

07:58.729 --> 08:00.606
so I,
I try to cheer him up.

08:00.815 --> 08:03.901
<i>I cannot believe you,
that you just said that.</i>

08:04.152 --> 08:05.236
<i>What kind of world is this?</i>

08:05.403 --> 08:07.321
Are you an animal?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.782
Do you know what
Macbeth is about?

08:10.032 --> 08:10.950
I'll tell you.

08:11.159 --> 08:14.996
It's a play about the
numbing of the moral sense.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.206
I tell Ryan that we have
nothing to go on this case.

08:17.415 --> 08:18.249
You know what he says to me?

08:18.458 --> 08:20.835
"Win some, lose some."

08:21.252 --> 08:22.587
You're a racist, Ryan.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.088
Did you know that?

08:24.338 --> 08:26.007
On the entrance exam
for new policeman,

08:26.215 --> 08:28.634
they ask, "What are rabies and
what would you do for them?"

08:28.801 --> 08:32.513
Ryan said, "Rabies
are Jewish priests,

08:32.679 --> 08:35.057
"and I would do anything I
possibly could for them."

08:37.143 --> 08:38.561
What was the murder
weapon, Stedman?

08:38.769 --> 08:40.062
I'd be guessing.

08:40.313 --> 08:41.731
Well, if not us, who?

08:41.981 --> 08:43.482
And if not now, when?

08:43.691 --> 08:44.358
All right.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.944
Something like
garden shears, maybe.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.488
We're abandoned.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.780
I didn't get you.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.575
I was signaling
beings on Mars.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.577
Sometimes they answer.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.078
Funny.

08:56.245 --> 08:58.956
So, are you enjoying
your luxury cruise

08:59.123 --> 09:00.833
aboard the Patna, Lord Jim?

09:02.835 --> 09:05.296
I want you to
telex Richmond right away

09:05.505 --> 09:08.257
and most urgently for the
file on the Gemini Killer.

09:08.466 --> 09:11.177
The Gemini Killer's
been dead for 15 years.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.178
Who was speaking to you?

09:12.386 --> 09:13.554
But he's dead.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.264
He should live so long.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.182
And the autopsy?

09:16.474 --> 09:17.225
When, please?

09:17.517 --> 09:18.392
Tomorrow.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.436
And tomorrow, and tomorrow.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.730
I am leaving you.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.774
Ryan, Stedman, go home.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.859
Go home to your families.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.986
Talk about wops.

09:32.073 --> 09:32.823
Starving?

09:33.074 --> 09:33.783
Not really.

09:34.033 --> 09:34.825
Just some coffee.

09:35.076 --> 09:37.954
Hey, you've been up since
five o'clock in the morning.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.580
I have this.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.665
How was your tour of Virginia?

09:40.915 --> 09:41.582
Neat.

09:41.832 --> 09:42.833
We stopped at a diner,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.586
and instead of potatoes,
they served Mama grits.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.048
So she says right out loud,
"These Jews are crazy."

09:49.257 --> 09:49.882
They are!

09:50.132 --> 09:51.884
They're all wackos.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.803
Next, they'll wanna eat papaya.

09:54.053 --> 09:54.720
My God.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.722
How was your day?

09:56.973 --> 09:58.224
Fabulous triumph.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.643
Our trackers at long
last brought in Mushkin,

10:00.893 --> 10:03.479
the Georgetown terrorist
and scourge of society

10:03.646 --> 10:05.106
who breaks into people's homes

10:05.356 --> 10:06.941
and completely redecorates.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.401
You okay, Bill?

10:09.569 --> 10:10.987
Hi, Daddy.

10:11.237 --> 10:11.904
And goodbye?

10:12.154 --> 10:13.447
Uh huh, off
to dance class.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.199
Pocahontas with the hair.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.451
<i>Watch out for red shoes.</i>

10:17.660 --> 10:18.995
So, you're home now.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.413
No, gotta go again.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.873
Today is my day to cheer
up our day Father Dyer.

10:25.293 --> 10:28.879
(approaching police sirens)

10:37.346 --> 10:38.598
(car screeches,
sirens turn off )

10:39.432 --> 10:40.891
What are you doing out here?

10:41.892 --> 10:45.062
Founding an order
called Lurking Fathers?

10:45.313 --> 10:46.981
I've been out
there for centuries.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.649
Four new popes
have been elected.

10:48.858 --> 10:50.318
It's a lot of white smoke.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.111
Official business.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.489
So all right.
So I'm late.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.491
So I know it.
So I'm sorry.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.367
I got...

11:00.703 --> 11:01.996
You want butter on it?

11:02.163 --> 11:03.247
No.

11:03.456 --> 11:04.582
And could I have
two Cokes, please?

11:04.832 --> 11:05.416
Medium or large?

11:05.625 --> 11:06.542
Medium.

11:06.792 --> 11:07.543
What are you doing?

11:07.793 --> 11:08.794
I need some lemon drops.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.171
We'll be late for the
start of the picture.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.298
I once spent a year hearing
children's confessions

11:12.506 --> 11:14.342
and I wound up a
lemon drop junkie.

11:14.592 --> 11:15.843
Little weirdoes keep
breathing it on you

11:16.093 --> 11:17.720
along with all that pot,
and between the two of them,

11:17.970 --> 11:19.513
I've got a feeling it's
probably addictive.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.601
(background chatter)

11:27.021 --> 11:29.523
Now I suppose you
have all sorts of

11:29.774 --> 11:31.359
rosary biz and the like.

11:31.609 --> 11:32.735
No, no.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.695
Loose as a goose.

11:34.904 --> 11:36.072
Maybe you should
go home and rest.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.240
I can't go home.

11:38.491 --> 11:39.158
Why?

11:39.325 --> 11:40.326
The carp.

11:41.619 --> 11:44.997
You know, I
thought you said...

11:45.164 --> 11:49.460
My wife's mother
is visiting, Father.

11:50.044 --> 11:52.004
And Tuesday night,
she's cooking us a carp.

11:52.254 --> 11:56.300
It's a tasty fish, I
have nothing against it.

11:56.550 --> 12:00.262
But because it's supposedly
filled with impurities,

12:00.513 --> 12:02.264
she buys it live.

12:03.516 --> 12:06.227
And for three days it's been

12:06.477 --> 12:09.313
swimming up and
down in my bathtub.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.024
Up

12:12.775 --> 12:13.943
and down.

12:15.653 --> 12:16.862
And I hate it.

12:17.113 --> 12:19.448
I can't stand the sight of it.

12:19.657 --> 12:21.450
Moving its gills.

12:22.827 --> 12:24.161
You're standing very
close to me, Father.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.955
Have you noticed?

12:26.497 --> 12:27.373
Yes.

12:28.541 --> 12:32.128
I haven't had a
bath for three days.

12:32.336 --> 12:35.339
I can't go home until
the carp is asleep.

12:35.548 --> 12:37.133
(Joe laughs)

12:37.383 --> 12:39.719
Because if I see it swimming,

12:41.971 --> 12:43.556
I'll kill it.

12:43.723 --> 12:46.684
(background chatter)

12:48.728 --> 12:50.312
- And a salad.
- Okay.

12:50.521 --> 12:54.150
The whole world is a
homicide victim, Father.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.485
Would a God who is good

12:56.694 --> 12:59.238
invent something like death?

12:59.405 --> 13:01.198
Plainly speaking,
it's a lousy idea.

13:01.365 --> 13:02.324
It's not popular, Father.

13:02.533 --> 13:03.242
It's not a winner.

13:03.451 --> 13:04.452
There you go, blaming God.

13:04.702 --> 13:05.995
Who should I
blame, Phil Rizzuto?

13:06.162 --> 13:07.204
You wouldn't want
to live forever.

13:07.413 --> 13:08.038
Yes, I would.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.790
No, you wouldn't.
You'd get bored.

13:09.999 --> 13:10.916
I have hobbies.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.418
In the meantime,

13:13.878 --> 13:16.881
we have cancer and mongoloid
babies and murderers,

13:17.089 --> 13:19.133
monsters prowling the planet.

13:19.383 --> 13:22.386
Even prowling this
neighborhood, Father.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.806
Right now, while
our children suffer

13:27.141 --> 13:29.560
and our loved ones die.

13:29.769 --> 13:33.689
And your God goes waltzing
blithely through the universe

13:33.898 --> 13:37.026
like some kind of
cosmic Billie Burke.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.278
Bill, it all works out right.

13:39.445 --> 13:40.237
When?

13:40.404 --> 13:41.739
At the end of time.

13:41.947 --> 13:42.782
That soon?

13:43.032 --> 13:44.617
No, we're gonna be there.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.869
We're gonna live forever, Bill.
We're spirits.

13:49.747 --> 13:52.583
How I would love
to believe that.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.753
It's that kid that got
killed on the dock, isn't it?

13:55.920 --> 13:57.671
I heard it on the news.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.799
You wanna talk about it?

14:01.425 --> 14:02.301
You knew him.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.346
A little bit.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.515
Police Boys Club.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.391
His name was Thomas.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.851
Thomas Kintry.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.897
Black boy, about 12 years old.

14:16.398 --> 14:17.149
The killer

14:19.360 --> 14:22.279
drove an ingot into
each of his eyes

14:23.447 --> 14:25.241
then cut off his head.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.871
<i>Is this okay, Father?</i>

14:31.080 --> 14:33.457
<i>I can get you something else.</i>

14:33.666 --> 14:34.959
Some more coffee?

14:42.466 --> 14:47.304
In place of his head was the
head from a statue of Christ,

14:47.555 --> 14:51.475
all done up in blackface, like
a minstrel show, you know?

14:51.642 --> 14:54.645
The eyes and the
mouth painted white.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.566
Mr. Bones.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.321
The boy had been crucified

15:07.074 --> 15:09.618
on a pair of rowing oars.

15:10.244 --> 15:13.873
(church bells tolling,
background chatter)

15:21.881 --> 15:23.132
May the Lord be in your heart

15:23.382 --> 15:26.010
and help you to
confess your sins.

15:27.803 --> 15:28.929
Yes?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.515
<i>(old woman)
I have a...</i>

15:31.682 --> 15:35.644
<i>a scrupulous conscience,
Father.</i>

15:36.729 --> 15:39.690
<i>This need to confess</i>

15:41.442 --> 15:43.319
<i>so many things.</i>

15:44.695 --> 15:49.617
<i>If I step on two straws
in the shape of a cross</i>

15:49.825 --> 15:53.662
<i>I feel that I have
to confess it.</i>

15:55.414 --> 15:56.957
<i>It torments me.</i>

15:58.000 --> 16:00.085
Try to make a good confession.

16:00.294 --> 16:03.213
And remember, Christ
forgives us, all of our sins.

16:04.381 --> 16:08.719
<i>Only little things, nothing.</i>

16:09.637 --> 16:11.639
<i>Seventeen of them, Father.</i>

16:13.098 --> 16:15.559
<i>The first was that waitress</i>

16:16.477 --> 16:18.312
<i>near Candlestick Park.</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:22.274
<i>I cut her throat and
watched her bleed.</i>

16:23.359 --> 16:25.110
<i>She bled a great deal.</i>

16:25.945 --> 16:29.448
<i>It's a problem that
I'm working on, Father.</i>

16:30.741 --> 16:32.785
<i>All this bleeding.</i>

16:33.243 --> 16:36.205
(maniacal laughter)

16:39.959 --> 16:43.629
(screaming and sobbing)

17:01.146 --> 17:03.899
(thunder rolling)

17:05.192 --> 17:07.694
(humming)

17:07.944 --> 17:11.115
(police radio chatter)

17:13.867 --> 17:16.619
I don't know. I don't know.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.039
He was such a good...

17:19.205 --> 17:22.626
(camera shutter clicking)

17:26.130 --> 17:30.217
(thunder rolling,
police radio chatter)

17:40.436 --> 17:41.603
You know, I've been
thinking, Lieutenant--

17:41.812 --> 17:43.230
This is new.

17:43.439 --> 17:45.733
Do we need prints from the
inside of the sliding panel?

17:45.983 --> 17:48.152
I mean, all you're gonna get
are the prints of the priests.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.319
Yes, I know.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.072
Then what's the point?

17:52.281 --> 17:53.991
I'm padding the job.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.328
(clicking pen)

18:03.000 --> 18:04.918
(thunder rolling)

18:51.006 --> 18:53.550
(eerie music)

19:04.311 --> 19:06.939
(women laughing)

19:10.067 --> 19:14.238
(eerie music,
wood sliding)

19:24.081 --> 19:27.918
(wood sliding continues)

19:48.522 --> 19:50.732
(window slams open)

19:50.983 --> 19:53.360
We got an autopsy on the boy.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.739
Yes.

19:57.948 --> 20:01.410
Kintry didn't die
from the decapitation.

20:01.660 --> 20:06.248
He was injected with a drug
called succinylcholine.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.334
They use it in
electroshock therapy.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.546
But injecting 10 milligrams

20:12.796 --> 20:15.132
for each 50 pounds
of body weight

20:15.382 --> 20:18.427
causes immediate
and total paralysis.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.389
The kid couldn't move or scream

20:22.598 --> 20:24.683
while the killer was
nailing and cutting him up.

20:24.892 --> 20:26.643
He was conscious?

20:26.852 --> 20:27.561
Yes.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.315
He was fully aware.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.651
The drug attacks the
respiratory system.

20:36.153 --> 20:39.448
He died from slow asphyxiation.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.874
<i>[Nurse On Speaker]

20:49.041 --> 20:50.542
<i>to West Wing nurses' station.</i>

20:50.792 --> 20:54.213
Father Dyer,
Joseph Dyer, D-Y-E-R.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.050
He's in room 411,
it's right down there.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.343
411.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.638
<i>[Nurse On Speaker]
Dr. Miller, line 118.</i>

21:12.481 --> 21:14.274
What's this nonsense?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.234
Well, nothing's really wrong.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.777
They're just doing some tests.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.153
You mean they
couldn't find the rabbit?

21:18.320 --> 21:19.321
I don't know you.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.281
You're reading
Women's Wear Daily?

21:21.490 --> 21:22.115
So what?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.409
Am I supposed to give
spiritual advice in a vacuum?

21:24.660 --> 21:26.078
Is that for me?

21:26.245 --> 21:29.331
Oh, I found it in the street,
I thought it suited you.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.166
(coughing)

21:31.375 --> 21:32.960
I thought you told me nothing's
really wrong with you.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.169
There isn't, my brother Eddie

21:34.419 --> 21:36.380
had these same stupid
symptoms for years.

21:36.588 --> 21:39.007
Your brother Eddie
died at the age of 30.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.634
So what, he got
killed in Vietnam.

21:40.801 --> 21:41.802
There could have
be some connection.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.136
A connection?

21:43.345 --> 21:44.554
Are you sure this
isn't serious, Joe?

21:44.721 --> 21:45.514
Well, with Eddie, there was--

21:45.681 --> 21:47.266
You shut up about Eddie!

21:47.516 --> 21:48.558
With my brother,
it was nerves.

21:48.725 --> 21:49.851
You make a lot of people
nervous.

21:50.102 --> 21:50.686
Only sinners.

21:50.894 --> 21:51.853
Everybody!

21:52.104 --> 21:53.522
Is everything
alright in here, guys?

21:53.730 --> 21:54.648
We're fine!

22:00.279 --> 22:01.822
I'm just tired.

22:02.531 --> 22:05.367
Well, call the
desk and book a room.

22:06.702 --> 22:07.619
I brought you a
hamburger, father.

22:07.828 --> 22:08.954
I'm not hungry.

22:09.121 --> 22:10.038
Eat half.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.206
It's from Clyde's.

22:11.415 --> 22:12.207
Where'd the other
half come from?

22:12.416 --> 22:14.751
Space, your native country.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.586
Who stuck this guy?

22:16.837 --> 22:18.463
Nice and peaceful
here, isn't it?

22:18.714 --> 22:19.381
Idyllic.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.342
Those things will
kill you, incidentally.

22:22.592 --> 22:23.719
They're quiet.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.596
Mr. Horowitz?

22:26.763 --> 22:27.973
Nope.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.599
This is 409?

22:29.808 --> 22:30.809
411.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.853
Never mind.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.354
Go in peace, my child.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.773
May the Schwartz be with you.

22:38.984 --> 22:41.320
Shouldn't you be reading
from the Gospels or something?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.238
They don't give
you all the fashions.

22:43.447 --> 22:44.406
Oh, this is true.

22:44.614 --> 22:45.741
Damn right.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.743
Look at the gooey gowns,
they're getting boring.

22:47.993 --> 22:49.244
Couldn't you get me
something serious to read?

22:49.453 --> 22:50.454
I've gotta be going.

22:50.704 --> 22:51.997
No, can't you pick
me something up?

22:52.164 --> 22:53.498
My God, the grammar.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.292
No, I want <i>The National
Enquirer</i> and <i>The Star.</i>

22:55.542 --> 22:57.919
There are Jesuit
missions in India, Father.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.379
Couldn't you find
one to work in?

22:59.588 --> 23:01.089
No look, these are all
last week's editions.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.341
I've read every one of them.

23:02.591 --> 23:03.550
If you will forgive me,

23:03.759 --> 23:05.302
I'll leave this
mystical conversation.

23:05.552 --> 23:08.972
Too much of aesthetics
always gives me a headache.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.307
Is it something I said?

23:10.557 --> 23:12.642
Mother India is
calling you, Father.

23:12.851 --> 23:15.187
<i>[Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Kincaid
to Orthopedics, please.</i>

23:17.481 --> 23:21.234
<i>[Nurse On Speaker]
EKG stat to ER, EKG stat to ER.</i>

23:26.323 --> 23:29.409
<i>Father Kanavan's vocal
cords were paralyzed.</i>

23:29.618 --> 23:31.370
<i>He couldn't make a sound.</i>

23:31.578 --> 23:33.205
<i>He couldn't cry out for help,</i>

23:33.914 --> 23:35.540
so the killer was
able to take his time.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.250
Succinylcholine again?

23:37.459 --> 23:41.213
In precisely the proper
dosage to cause the paralysis.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.340
A fraction too little
has no effect.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.884
A fraction too much
causes instant death.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.720
Our friend has
medical expertise.

23:48.929 --> 23:51.598
Did we find a hypodermic
at the crime scene?

23:51.807 --> 23:52.891
No syringe.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.684
What about the
fingerprint analysis?

23:54.893 --> 23:56.478
Most of the prints
were the priest's.

23:56.686 --> 23:57.854
You said most?

23:59.231 --> 24:01.441
We've got something else.

24:03.777 --> 24:06.613
Right here, on the inside
pull of this panel.

24:06.822 --> 24:07.739
It's strange.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.534
Nobody touches this
pull but the priest.

24:10.742 --> 24:12.119
And the killer.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.123
See, he wants the panel closed,

24:16.331 --> 24:18.083
so the next person in
line for confession

24:18.291 --> 24:20.210
doesn't know that
Father Kanavan is dead.

24:20.419 --> 24:24.131
So he puts his hand in
and slides it almost shut.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.675
Then he has to pull
his hand back out

24:26.842 --> 24:29.678
and finish the job
from the outside.

24:29.845 --> 24:32.013
So the prints on the oars
from the crucified boy

24:32.222 --> 24:33.265
match the prints on the panel.

24:33.557 --> 24:34.808
Correct?

24:35.016 --> 24:36.935
They're one and the same.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.273
Well, aren't they?

24:47.320 --> 24:50.031
Two different people
committed these murders?

24:52.325 --> 24:53.118
<i>(Kinderman)
Where's Julie?</i>

24:53.535 --> 24:55.036
<i>(Mary)

24:55.203 --> 24:56.705
<i>(Kinderman)

26:17.077 --> 26:18.286

(Boy 1) No, it isn't.

26:18.495 --> 26:19.246
(Boy 1)
If it hits the line,

26:19.454 --> 26:20.038
it's out of bounds.

26:21.957 --> 26:22.791

<i>Earth, come in please.</i>

<i>Can you hear us?</i>

I'm so sorry you were
murdered, Thomas, I miss you.

26:40.725 --> 26:41.977
I miss you too.

26:43.144 --> 26:46.648
(smooth big band playing)

27:08.003 --> 27:10.338
You know, I wonder if both
of us are dreaming this.

27:10.589 --> 27:11.923
No, Bill.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.341
I'm not dreaming.

<i>Dr. Bartlet, please

29:28.935 --> 29:29.644
Ugh...

29:38.278 --> 29:42.407
(thunder rolling)

29:52.500 --> 29:53.877
What are these?

29:57.714 --> 30:00.175
What are they, what's in them?

30:01.760 --> 30:04.679
Father Dyer's
entire blood supply.

30:10.226 --> 30:11.019
What?

30:15.690 --> 30:17.066
All of his blood?

30:20.236 --> 30:22.238
And not a drop of it spilled.

30:23.573 --> 30:24.574
All neat.

30:26.201 --> 30:29.329
There's not even a
smudge on the jars.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.961
There's only the
writing in his blood.

30:41.758 --> 30:42.592
Writing?

30:48.306 --> 30:49.891
On the wall.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.811
(thunder rolling)

31:01.027 --> 31:03.029

31:06.825 --> 31:08.368
<i>[Nurse On Speaker]

<i>[Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Hoffman,
line 412, please.</i>

31:14.415 --> 31:16.209
Take a squad of men.

31:17.627 --> 31:19.838
Make sure all the
hospital doors are locked.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.840
Make a pattern search.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.132
No one in.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.051
No one out.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.012
Except for emergencies.

31:31.099 --> 31:31.850
No one.

31:32.892 --> 31:33.810
All right.

<i>[Nurse on Speaker] EKG

31:39.691 --> 31:40.567
Now,

31:42.569 --> 31:43.903
what time was the

31:46.030 --> 31:47.991
body discovered?

31:48.199 --> 31:48.950
At six.

31:50.743 --> 31:51.744
By whom?

31:53.246 --> 31:55.081
You saw him at 5 a.m.?

31:56.708 --> 31:58.167
Yes, that's right.

31:58.376 --> 31:59.544
He was awake?

32:01.671 --> 32:02.922
He was awake.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.383
I came to give him medication.

32:05.633 --> 32:06.968
How long did it take you?

32:08.511 --> 32:09.804
About a minute.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.222
And then what?

32:11.472 --> 32:13.683
I came back to the desk.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.727
And you were here
to do what and do,

32:15.935 --> 32:17.937
see Father Dyer again at
six o'clock, is that right?

32:18.146 --> 32:19.105
Yes, that's right.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.982
Were you here or
inside in the office?

32:21.232 --> 32:22.734
I was inside the office,

32:22.942 --> 32:24.611
I was writing up reports.

32:24.819 --> 32:27.739
So, If someone had
entered Father Dyer's room

32:27.947 --> 32:29.782
between the time you left
and the time you returned,

32:30.033 --> 32:31.701
you might well not
have seen them.

32:31.951 --> 32:32.577
That's right.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.704
Did you see anybody else
come into the room?

32:35.121 --> 32:36.915
No, I didn't.

32:37.081 --> 32:38.207
Or leaving the room?

32:38.416 --> 32:40.043
No, I didn't.

32:40.251 --> 32:42.420
Did you see anybody
in the hallway?

32:42.629 --> 32:44.964
Did you see anybody
in the hallway?

32:45.173 --> 32:46.132
Mrs. Clelia.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.217
You saw Mrs. Clelia
walking around?

32:48.426 --> 32:50.303
No, not exactly.

32:50.553 --> 32:51.930
Not exactly?

32:55.516 --> 32:58.061
I found her lying
completely unconscious.

32:58.311 --> 32:58.937
When was that?

32:59.145 --> 33:02.065
On my way to give the
Father his last medication.

33:02.315 --> 33:03.358
The five or the six?

33:03.524 --> 33:04.651
The six.

33:04.901 --> 33:06.527
Mrs. Clelia is a patient?

33:06.736 --> 33:07.862
Yes, she is.

33:08.112 --> 33:08.905
In Neurology?

33:09.155 --> 33:11.199
<i>[Nurse on Speaker] Dr.

33:11.366 --> 33:14.619
<i>Dr. Randolph to examining

(moaning)

33:31.219 --> 33:33.596
<i>How we doing today?</i>

33:38.351 --> 33:40.186
They're all harmless.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.523
Some more serious problems
here too, though, of course.

33:43.731 --> 33:44.691
Some catatonics,

33:44.941 --> 33:47.318
some with Alzheimer's, autism.

33:50.488 --> 33:52.156
Are you my son?

33:53.282 --> 33:56.119
I'd be very proud
to believe so.

33:58.121 --> 34:00.081
You're not my son.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.959
(eerie growling)

34:06.963 --> 34:09.632
There's your girl over there.

34:10.925 --> 34:13.052
(humming)

34:18.641 --> 34:19.726
Mrs. Clelia?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.355
My name is William Kinderman.

34:24.522 --> 34:25.313
Yes.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.360
Would you help me, please?

34:30.570 --> 34:32.405
What about my radio?

34:32.612 --> 34:33.697
Pardon me?

34:33.906 --> 34:35.824
<i>I said, my radio.</i>

34:36.074 --> 34:37.952
Aren't you gonna fix it?

34:39.120 --> 34:41.914
<i>Ugh, nothing ever gets
fixed around here.</i>

34:42.081 --> 34:44.958
Just a bunch of
pies and anchovies.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.210
Go away!

34:48.170 --> 34:50.339
<i>I don't ever talk to strangers.</i>

34:50.882 --> 34:53.509
I'm the radio
repairman, Mrs. Clelia.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.012
Well, fix it.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.638
<i>Well, what's wrong with it?</i>

34:57.847 --> 34:59.599
Dead people talking.

35:03.394 --> 35:04.562
It's right here.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.356
Do you see it?

35:08.441 --> 35:09.484
Yes, I see it.

35:11.069 --> 35:14.697
I just knew you weren't
really a radio repairman.

35:14.906 --> 35:17.325
That's a telephone I'm holding.

35:20.036 --> 35:21.079
It's alright.

35:22.413 --> 35:25.291
A lot of people wouldn't
know the difference either.

35:27.001 --> 35:28.127
It's all right.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.299
You have a very kind face.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.598
You will do well.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.394
(humming)

35:55.488 --> 35:57.865
You caught her
on a talkative day.

35:58.116 --> 35:59.158
You being funny?

35:59.367 --> 36:01.994
No, she's quasi-catatonic,
in and out.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.079
What's this?

36:03.746 --> 36:05.039
It's the disturbed ward.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.220
(door slides shut)

36:24.183 --> 36:25.184
To get out,

36:29.063 --> 36:31.107
you punch a
four-digit combination

36:31.357 --> 36:34.193
that sends a signal out
to the control booth.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.653
The inner door opens.

36:35.903 --> 36:37.822
The control booth
operator visually checks

36:38.072 --> 36:40.241
through the one-way glass.

36:40.449 --> 36:43.411
And, every day, there's
a new combination.

36:43.661 --> 36:44.996
I'd like to look around.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.594
<i>Bill.</i>

37:13.107 --> 37:15.109
(door slides open)

37:16.152 --> 37:17.195
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

37:18.446 --> 37:20.740
Dr. Freedman's gone
ballistic, sir.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.158
I think you need to come.

37:22.325 --> 37:24.243
(inaudible dialogue)

37:30.041 --> 37:33.085
<i>Death, be not proud.</i>

37:33.294 --> 37:37.673
<i>Though some have called
thee mighty and dreadful,</i>

37:37.840 --> 37:39.342
<i>thou art not so.</i>

37:41.219 --> 37:45.306
<i>Though soonest our
best men with thee go,</i>

37:45.556 --> 37:48.643
<i>rest of their bones

37:50.895 --> 37:53.814
<i>but those thou dost
thinkest thou dost overthrow</i>

37:54.065 --> 37:55.650
<i>die not, poor Death.</i>

37:58.361 --> 38:00.279
<i>Nor canst thou kill me.</i>

38:03.199 --> 38:06.869
<i>I was only 21 when I died.</i>

38:07.078 --> 38:10.039
We're a hospital
here, not a war zone.

38:10.206 --> 38:11.999
<i>How do you expect us
to keep people calm</i>

38:12.208 --> 38:13.501
<i>when you're running
around here--</i>

38:13.751 --> 38:17.505
(phone ringing, yelling muffled)

38:26.472 --> 38:27.974
<i>You need a court warrant
in order to be here</i>

38:28.224 --> 38:30.017
<i>doing what you're doing!</i>

38:30.226 --> 38:31.894
Look, I fully
appreciate your trying

38:32.144 --> 38:33.938
to prevent further tragedy.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.107
Think of the state of
our patients' minds

38:36.357 --> 38:37.858
when you've got these
policemen here--

38:38.067 --> 38:40.194
Lieutenant wants fingerprints
taken of all the hospital staff.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.153
He said fingerprints.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.405
Not on your life, god dammit!

38:42.613 --> 38:43.906
No sir, no way, Jose!

38:44.156 --> 38:44.782
No, he's standing right here.

38:45.032 --> 38:46.200
Do you want to talk to him?

38:46.409 --> 38:47.159
I don't want 100 lawyers
running up and down the halls.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.577
Do you want to talk to him!

38:48.786 --> 38:50.705
You ever heard of
malpractice suits?

38:50.955 --> 38:52.331
You ever heard of
the Gemini Killer?

38:52.581 --> 38:53.541
Have I what?

38:53.791 --> 38:54.292
I said--

38:54.542 --> 38:55.793
Yes, of course I've
heard of him, so what?

38:55.960 --> 38:57.086
He's dead.

38:57.295 --> 38:59.672
That's right, he died
in the electric chair.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.966
<i>And so why are we
talking about that?</i>

39:02.174 --> 39:04.593
<i>Just a minute, I'll explain.</i>

39:04.760 --> 39:06.470
Yes, the Gemini is dead.

39:06.679 --> 39:08.597
We know that, but do you
recall all the stories

39:08.764 --> 39:11.100
in the papers and on television,

39:11.309 --> 39:13.811
about the Gemini's strange MO?

39:14.061 --> 39:14.979
I'll remind you.

39:15.187 --> 39:15.980
Supposedly,

39:17.440 --> 39:19.900
supposedly the middle finger
of the victim's left hand

39:20.151 --> 39:21.485
was always found

39:21.694 --> 39:23.612
severed, always missing.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.573
In addition,

39:26.824 --> 39:28.159
on the victim's
back we were told,

39:28.326 --> 39:29.952
the killer carved out

39:30.995 --> 39:32.955
a sign of the zodiac.

39:34.582 --> 39:35.916
The Gemini symbol, the twins.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.210
That was 15 years ago.

39:38.461 --> 39:39.503
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

39:39.754 --> 39:40.713
Temple, why are
you encouraging this?

39:40.880 --> 39:43.007
Would you shut your mouth!

39:48.554 --> 39:49.305
Excuse me.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.438
Excuse me.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.446
<i>[Nurse On Speaker]
EKG stat to ER. EKG stat to ER.</i>

40:05.654 --> 40:07.740
The Gemini MO

40:09.283 --> 40:11.744
that you heard about is false.

40:13.621 --> 40:16.457
The missing finger was not
on the victim's left hand,

40:16.665 --> 40:19.919
but on the right, it was
the index finger, this one.

40:20.127 --> 40:23.130
And the sign of the
Gemini was carved

40:24.131 --> 40:26.217
not on the victim's back,

40:27.426 --> 40:30.554
but on the victim's
left hand palm.

40:30.721 --> 40:32.473
Only Richmond
Homicide knew that,

40:32.640 --> 40:33.516
no one else.

40:34.642 --> 40:36.477
A misinformation
was fed to the press

40:36.644 --> 40:37.812
in order to weed out
all the crackpots

40:38.062 --> 40:39.063
who were coming
in saying everyday

40:39.313 --> 40:40.689
that they were
the Gemini killer.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.233
How did you kill him?

40:42.441 --> 40:44.235
"Well, first I cut off this
finger," the loony says,

40:44.402 --> 40:47.405
"And on their backs
I made my mark."

40:47.613 --> 40:48.572
Next case.

40:50.032 --> 40:50.783
But,

40:51.534 --> 40:54.078
in this case, gentlemen,

40:54.286 --> 40:55.079
in this

40:56.497 --> 40:59.417
three decapitations,
three victims,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.794
with this finger severed,

41:01.961 --> 41:03.796
the correct one.

41:03.963 --> 41:06.590
And the sign of the Gemini here.

41:09.802 --> 41:10.636
Here!

41:13.973 --> 41:15.182
One more thing.

41:17.435 --> 41:20.312
The Gemini wrote letters
to the newspapers,

41:20.521 --> 41:22.565
bragging about his murders.

41:22.773 --> 41:25.192
And he always
doubled his final L's,

41:25.401 --> 41:29.613
whatever the word, two
L's, as in wonderfull.

41:31.115 --> 41:31.824
Yes.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.286
The victims' names
always starting

41:35.494 --> 41:38.080
with K, like Karl, his father

41:38.873 --> 41:40.541
the famous evangelist
whom he hated

41:40.791 --> 41:42.293
and wanted to shame.

41:42.543 --> 41:46.464
And whom he wanted to kill
and keep killing and killing.

41:46.672 --> 41:50.384
But the priest, Father
Dyer, Joseph Dyer.

41:51.260 --> 41:54.096
Father Dyer's
middle name was Kevin.

41:54.305 --> 41:55.723
Kevin.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.809
(eerie wind blowing)

42:03.314 --> 42:05.232
Even that could do it.

42:06.650 --> 42:08.569
Would it take a
lot of strength?

42:08.777 --> 42:10.529
No, not at all.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.156
Very little, in fact.

42:16.410 --> 42:17.578
<i>Spring-activated,</i>

42:17.786 --> 42:20.456
open it, and it
closes on its own.

42:24.251 --> 42:25.961
Takes strength
just to open it.

42:26.212 --> 42:26.879
Oh...

42:37.431 --> 42:39.225
It's a little stiff.

42:39.475 --> 42:41.018
It needs adjustment.

42:42.853 --> 42:43.479
What's this?

42:43.729 --> 42:44.396
What?

42:44.563 --> 42:45.523
<i>This label.</i>

42:46.982 --> 42:48.943
Just a shipping tag.

42:49.193 --> 42:50.319
Is it new?

42:50.569 --> 42:51.737
Just came in.

42:52.947 --> 42:54.198
A replacement?

42:57.993 --> 42:58.911
Where's the old one?

43:07.920 --> 43:09.672
(clock ticking)

43:09.880 --> 43:13.634
Two priests and a crucified
boy, Father Healey.

43:13.801 --> 43:18.389
Clearly some religious
connection, but what is it?

43:20.933 --> 43:23.519
I don't know what
I'm looking for.

43:23.686 --> 43:24.562
I'm groping.

43:26.814 --> 43:27.982
(sighs)

43:28.232 --> 43:29.608
But,

43:29.817 --> 43:32.152
besides being priests,

43:32.361 --> 43:36.240
what might Kanavan and
Dyer have had in common?

43:36.490 --> 43:37.783
Where's the link?

43:39.994 --> 43:41.287
I don't know.

43:42.538 --> 43:43.581
I don't know.

43:46.125 --> 43:46.917
Dear God.

43:48.168 --> 43:51.213
(clock falls silent)

44:01.640 --> 44:03.767
It could be that exorcism.

44:03.976 --> 44:06.478
The MacNeil kid, Regan MacNeil.

44:07.396 --> 44:10.858
The exorcism over on Prospect
Street that Damien Karras did,

44:13.193 --> 44:14.820
the one that killed him.

44:15.738 --> 44:18.198
(soft sobbing)

44:19.992 --> 44:22.620
(door creaking)

44:24.288 --> 44:28.375
(whispering in foreign language)

44:32.880 --> 44:35.299
(soft thump)

44:45.684 --> 44:48.437
(door creaking)

44:52.900 --> 44:56.945
(whispering in foreign language)

45:06.038 --> 45:08.957
(ominous rattling)

45:14.922 --> 45:18.967
(whispering in foreign language)

45:20.094 --> 45:23.013
(dramatic echoing)

45:30.896 --> 45:33.023
(moaning)

45:36.360 --> 45:40.322
(whispering in foreign language)

45:46.036 --> 45:47.371
(growling)

45:47.579 --> 45:48.706
(screaming)

45:48.956 --> 45:50.958
(laughing) Excuse me.

45:51.125 --> 45:51.917
<i>(Father)
Alice!</i>

45:52.084 --> 45:53.377
The speech!

45:53.585 --> 45:55.337
Will you give this to
Father, please Lieutenant?

45:55.546 --> 45:56.422
I gotta run.

45:58.298 --> 45:59.758
What's the matter
with these lights?

46:00.008 --> 46:00.884
<i>Good night, Alice!</i>

46:01.135 --> 46:02.720
Good night, Father.

46:06.640 --> 46:09.059
(door slams)

46:26.660 --> 46:28.454
Your speech, Father.

46:29.538 --> 46:30.622
Thanks.

46:30.873 --> 46:32.291
That's all right.

46:33.792 --> 46:34.918
Need a drink?

46:37.212 --> 46:37.963
I do.

46:45.179 --> 46:48.098
Do you believe in
possession, Father?

46:48.557 --> 46:49.558
Who cares?

46:49.808 --> 46:50.809
I've got enough to do

46:51.018 --> 46:52.895
worrying about kids
who need scholarships.

46:53.103 --> 46:54.730
I'll talk to Paul
Morning, if you like.

46:54.938 --> 46:55.981
Who is he?

46:56.231 --> 46:58.650
He's our chaplain
over at the hospital.

46:58.859 --> 47:00.652
<i>They say he performed
an exorcism once</i>

47:00.861 --> 47:02.029
<i>in the Philippines.</i>

47:02.237 --> 47:05.032
The story is his hair
turned white overnight.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.075
Is that true?

47:07.242 --> 47:07.993
What's the difference?

47:08.160 --> 47:09.912
What's that got to do with this?

47:10.120 --> 47:13.373
Well, you mentioned
that exorcism.

47:13.582 --> 47:14.666
As a connection.

47:16.084 --> 47:17.878
To the people who
were murdered, you mean.

47:18.045 --> 47:19.213
That's right.

47:19.421 --> 47:21.799
Joe and Damien Karras
were very close.

47:21.965 --> 47:23.258
Yes, I know.

47:23.467 --> 47:26.762
Joe was also a
friend of the MacNeils.

47:27.012 --> 47:28.680
And Father Kanavan?

47:28.931 --> 47:30.682
Kanavan had my job back then.

47:30.933 --> 47:33.811
<i>He gave Damien permission
to investigate the case.</i>

47:34.019 --> 47:36.271
That leaves us with
the Kintry boy, Father.

47:36.480 --> 47:37.397
Does it?

47:37.564 --> 47:39.733
Damien gave our
School of Linguistics

47:39.942 --> 47:42.903
a tape he wanted them
to analyze for him,

47:43.153 --> 47:45.197
the voice of the MacNeil kid,

47:45.364 --> 47:47.032
supposedly possessed.

47:48.200 --> 47:50.118
He wanted to find out if
the sounds on the tape

47:50.369 --> 47:53.997
were a language or just
a lot of gibberish.

47:54.164 --> 47:55.582
He was looking for
proof the MacNeil kid

47:55.833 --> 47:56.792
was speaking in a language

47:57.000 --> 47:58.544
she couldn't
possibly have known.

47:58.794 --> 47:59.753
And was she?

48:00.170 --> 48:00.879
No.

48:03.215 --> 48:05.759
The tape was really
English in reverse.

48:05.926 --> 48:07.302
But the expert who
figured that out--

48:07.553 --> 48:08.929
Was Kintry's mother.

48:09.179 --> 48:11.682
(bird chirping)

48:33.120 --> 48:36.039
(bird falls silent)

48:39.960 --> 48:42.546
(ominous music)

49:16.330 --> 49:20.417
(ominous music,
footsteps echoing)

49:50.113 --> 49:54.159
(wind blowing, paper flapping)

49:58.538 --> 50:00.666
(beeping)

50:05.921 --> 50:07.714
This is impossible.

50:09.216 --> 50:11.176
(thunder rolling, rain falling)

50:21.812 --> 50:23.021
Do you remember coming in here

50:23.271 --> 50:25.983
when the priest
died, Mrs. Clelia?

50:32.239 --> 50:33.699
You're the radio man.

50:33.907 --> 50:35.450
Yes, that's right.

50:36.702 --> 50:39.287
Do you remember coming in here?

50:48.755 --> 50:49.673
Do you remember coming in here

50:49.840 --> 50:51.758
and touching those jars?

50:56.179 --> 50:59.391
Why did you touch
them, Mrs. Clelia?

51:01.143 --> 51:04.062
Was there anyone
else in this room?

51:07.274 --> 51:08.567
Who was in here?

51:13.238 --> 51:15.449
That radio isn't mine.

51:15.657 --> 51:16.658
Mine is newer.

51:21.496 --> 51:23.999
<i>That man in the
isolation tank,</i>

51:24.166 --> 51:26.334
<i>you know, the one
you looked in on?</i>

51:26.543 --> 51:27.878
<i>(clears throat)</i>

51:28.712 --> 51:31.506
<i>You know, the one
you looked in on.</i>

51:32.758 --> 51:37.220
<i>Well, the police brought
him in here 15 years ago.</i>

51:37.471 --> 51:40.932
<i>They picked him up
wandering the C&O Canal,</i>

51:41.725 --> 51:43.518
<i>uh, no, no,</i>

51:44.561 --> 51:46.438
<i>down around Key Bridge.</i>

51:51.651 --> 51:54.279
<i>Yes, total amnesia.</i>

51:56.281 --> 51:59.534
The man in the
isolation tank...

51:59.743 --> 52:02.579
You know, the one
you looked in on.

52:07.375 --> 52:11.004
The police brought him
in here 15 years ago.

52:12.172 --> 52:15.634
They picked him up
wandering the C&O Canal.

52:17.260 --> 52:17.928
Down around Key--

52:18.136 --> 52:19.179
(door rattling)

52:21.681 --> 52:24.309
You had something to tell me?

52:26.478 --> 52:28.021
Please, sit down.

52:42.953 --> 52:44.955
There's a paper drive?

52:46.957 --> 52:50.252
Haven't had a chance
yet to read them.

52:52.379 --> 52:54.589
I just keep them till I do.

52:56.049 --> 52:58.927
I hate to miss the
science articles.

52:59.136 --> 53:00.095
They're good.

53:03.014 --> 53:04.975
(thunder rolling)

53:19.948 --> 53:22.951
That man in the isolation tank,

53:23.160 --> 53:25.495
you know, the one
you looked in on.

53:25.704 --> 53:26.913
Yes.

53:27.080 --> 53:30.584
The police brought
him here 15 years ago.

53:30.834 --> 53:33.295
They picked him up
wandering the C&O Canal

53:33.503 --> 53:35.505
down around Key Bridge,

53:35.714 --> 53:38.258
total amnesia, no ID.

53:38.633 --> 53:41.344
They brought him to us here,

53:41.595 --> 53:43.972
and his condition grew worse.

53:44.181 --> 53:46.433
<i>He ended up catatonic,</i>

53:46.600 --> 53:48.852
<i>completely withdrawn.</i>

53:49.060 --> 53:50.312
But recently...

53:55.192 --> 53:55.942
Well,

53:57.777 --> 54:00.030
about six weeks ago,

54:00.739 --> 54:03.950
he slowly started
to come out of it.

54:04.159 --> 54:05.952
Every day he got better,

54:07.329 --> 54:09.039
<i>just a little, but better.</i>

54:10.457 --> 54:13.418
And then all of a
sudden, he got violent,

54:13.627 --> 54:15.462
really bad news.

54:16.922 --> 54:19.966
<i>We've been giving him
electroshock therapy,</i>

54:20.175 --> 54:21.176
and as of two weeks ago

54:21.384 --> 54:23.803
he's been in isolation, but...

54:26.264 --> 54:28.642
The thing is, Lieutenant...

54:29.267 --> 54:30.352
Yes?

54:33.730 --> 54:36.066
He says he's
the Gemini Killer.

54:36.316 --> 54:38.693
(eerie music)

54:48.578 --> 54:51.623
I want the file on that man.

54:51.873 --> 54:53.083
Get it.

54:53.792 --> 54:54.751
Now!

54:56.002 --> 54:59.422
You wanted to know
about the man in cell 11.

54:59.673 --> 55:00.632
Stretch your memory.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.550
What was he wearing when
they brought him in?

55:02.759 --> 55:03.677
Do you recall?

55:03.843 --> 55:06.179
That was quite some time ago.

55:06.388 --> 55:08.515
Was he dressed like a priest?

55:09.099 --> 55:10.433
Like a priest?

55:10.600 --> 55:11.559
Were there any
signs of injuries?

55:11.768 --> 55:12.727
Blood, lacerations?

55:12.936 --> 55:14.396
That would be in the file.

55:14.896 --> 55:17.107
It is not in the file!

55:17.357 --> 55:18.358
It is not!

55:18.942 --> 55:19.985
Two men on every ward.

55:20.235 --> 55:21.945
Rotate them 24 hours a day.

55:22.195 --> 55:22.904
Mm-hmm.

55:23.154 --> 55:24.281
On the disturbed ward,

55:24.489 --> 55:26.449
one man inside near
the entry door,

55:26.700 --> 55:28.201
one man outside the door.

55:28.410 --> 55:29.995
Ask the Jesuits in Georgetown

55:30.161 --> 55:32.706
for the dental records of
a Father Damien Karras.

55:32.956 --> 55:35.000
Find out if he ever
had a saliva test.

55:35.208 --> 55:37.752
Might help us get a
positive identification.

55:37.961 --> 55:39.129
What for, sir?

55:40.505 --> 55:41.589
Sir, are you alright?

55:41.798 --> 55:42.465
Mmm...

55:44.551 --> 55:46.219
<i>[Nurse On Speaker]
IV team to NICU.</i>

55:46.428 --> 55:47.679
<i>IV team to NICU.</i>

55:51.683 --> 55:53.226
You all right?

55:53.476 --> 55:54.185
Yeah.

55:55.520 --> 55:56.688
Father Karras,

55:58.398 --> 56:02.402
was a Jesuit psychiatrist
at Georgetown University.

56:02.610 --> 56:04.237
The man was a saint.

56:05.322 --> 56:08.491
He was my best
friend, I loved him.

56:08.742 --> 56:10.618
Fifteen years ago,

56:10.827 --> 56:12.287
he jumped or was
pushed to his death

56:12.495 --> 56:14.664
down that long flight of steps

56:14.914 --> 56:16.458
next to the Car Barn.

56:18.293 --> 56:19.085
Atkins,

56:21.171 --> 56:22.005
I saw it.

56:23.381 --> 56:25.175
I watched him,

56:25.383 --> 56:26.217
die.

56:29.971 --> 56:31.014
I think,

56:32.640 --> 56:34.225
the man in cell 11,

56:36.561 --> 56:37.812
is Damien Karras.

56:40.648 --> 56:42.859
(growling)

56:48.656 --> 56:50.575
It's a wonderful life.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.793
(water dripping)

57:04.547 --> 57:05.590
Who are you?

57:08.301 --> 57:09.594
I am no one.

57:13.640 --> 57:14.474
Many.

57:17.018 --> 57:19.020
Are you Damien Karras?

57:19.270 --> 57:23.316
Ah, you haven't any medical
records for him, have you?

57:23.483 --> 57:25.318
No tedious fingerprints.

57:25.485 --> 57:26.778
Are you Karras?

57:26.986 --> 57:30.073
I am the Gemini
Killer, James Venamun.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.282
The Gemini is dead.

57:31.533 --> 57:33.201
No, not quite.

57:35.161 --> 57:36.413
Remember Karen?

57:38.373 --> 57:39.999
Little ribbons in her hair?

57:40.166 --> 57:41.751
Yellow ribbons.

57:44.879 --> 57:45.839
I killed her.

57:48.216 --> 57:51.553
Well, after all, it was
inevitable wasn't it?

57:51.761 --> 57:55.056
A divinity shapes our
ends, and all that.

57:56.975 --> 57:59.310
I picked her up in Richmond.

58:00.478 --> 58:04.107
And then I dropped her
off at the city dump,

58:05.400 --> 58:07.026
some of her.

58:07.277 --> 58:08.736
Some of her I kept.

58:09.696 --> 58:10.864
I'm a saver.

58:13.450 --> 58:16.244
Pretty dress she was wearing.

58:16.494 --> 58:18.955
Little peasant blouse, pink,

58:20.331 --> 58:21.833
and white ruffles.

58:24.252 --> 58:29.090
I still hear from her
occasionally, screaming.

58:29.841 --> 58:31.843
<i>I think the dead should shut up</i>

58:32.051 --> 58:34.095
<i>unless there's something
to say.</i>

58:39.517 --> 58:42.937
I also killed the
black boy by the river,

58:44.981 --> 58:46.316
and the priests.

58:48.067 --> 58:51.613
Oh, yes, their names
began with a K.

58:51.821 --> 58:55.992
That little modicum at least,
I was able to insist upon.

58:56.201 --> 58:57.660
You see, they were
off my beaten track.

58:57.911 --> 58:59.162
I kill at random.

59:00.205 --> 59:01.122
That's the thrill of it.

59:01.372 --> 59:03.416
No motive, that's the fun.

59:05.376 --> 59:07.879
The black boy and the priests

59:08.046 --> 59:09.172
were different.

59:10.673 --> 59:14.344
I was obliged to settle
a score on behalf of,

59:15.970 --> 59:16.763
well,

59:18.014 --> 59:18.932
a friend.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.227
What friend?

59:22.477 --> 59:24.395
A friend over there,

59:24.562 --> 59:25.688
on the other side.

59:25.897 --> 59:27.899
One needs friends.

59:28.107 --> 59:29.067
There is suffering over there.

59:29.317 --> 59:30.443
They can be cruel.

59:30.693 --> 59:32.195
Who is they?

59:32.362 --> 59:33.446
Never mind.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.241
I cannot tell you, it's,

59:37.575 --> 59:38.535
forbidden.

59:39.369 --> 59:42.038
(loud growling)

59:51.005 --> 59:52.799
I do that rather well,

59:54.092 --> 59:55.385
don't you think?

59:58.972 --> 01:00:00.890
Well why not, after all,

01:00:04.352 --> 01:00:06.813
I've been taught by the master.

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.233
Who is that?

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:11.985
The one.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:18.533
There is only one.

01:00:20.368 --> 01:00:23.079
(water dripping)

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:29.168
Incidentally, who is this
Damien you mentioned?

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:30.336
Don't you know?

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:32.088
I know nothing,

01:00:32.297 --> 01:00:36.384
except I must go on killing
daddy, I must shame him.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.055
Are they calling these Gemini
killings in the papers?

01:00:41.264 --> 01:00:43.016
You must get them to
do that, Lieutenant.

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:44.559
It's important.

01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:46.477
The Gemini is dead.

01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:49.897
No, I am not, I'm alive!

01:00:50.106 --> 01:00:52.900
<i>I go on, I breathe!</i>

01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:57.071
Look at me, look at me,
and tell me what you see!

01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:02.493
I see a man who looks
like Damien Karras.

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:08.041
If you looked with
the eyes of faith,

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.376
you'd see me.

01:01:11.586 --> 01:01:13.796
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:15.590
Your blindness.

01:01:21.137 --> 01:01:25.433
Tell the press that I am
the Gemini, Lieutenant,

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.852
or I will punish you.

01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:29.145
Punish me?

01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:30.229
Yes.

01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:32.023
What are you talking about?

01:01:32.273 --> 01:01:33.441
Do you dance?

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.693
What do you mean?

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:40.031
(female voice singing
in foreign language)

01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:52.919
I like plays.

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:56.506
The good ones, Shakespeare.

01:01:57.215 --> 01:02:00.385
I like Titus
Andronicus the best.

01:02:00.635 --> 01:02:01.928
It's sweet.

01:02:03.012 --> 01:02:04.055
Incidentally,

01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:09.811
did you know that you
are talking to an artist?

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.526
I sometimes do special
things to my victims.

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:19.320
Things that are creative.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.073
Of course, it takes knowledge,

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.367
pride in your work.

01:02:28.246 --> 01:02:29.247
For example,

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:35.586
a decapitated head
can continue to see

01:02:35.837 --> 01:02:39.757
for approximately 20 seconds.

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:43.219
So when I have one
that's cocking,

01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:47.932
I always hold it up so
that it can see its body.

01:02:48.641 --> 01:02:52.437
It's a little extra I throw
in for no added charge.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.233
I must admit, it makes
me chuckle every time.

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:01.195
Life is fun.

01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:05.658
It's a wonderful life, in fact,

01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:09.579
for some.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.919
It's too bad about
poor Father Dyer.

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:21.883
I killed him, you know.

01:03:23.968 --> 01:03:26.471
An interesting problem,

01:03:26.679 --> 01:03:29.474
but finally it worked.

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:34.103
First, a bit of the
old succinylcholine

01:03:34.353 --> 01:03:35.313
to permit one to work

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.941
without annoying distractions.

01:03:40.193 --> 01:03:40.985
Then...

01:03:42.028 --> 01:03:46.282
a three foot catheter
threaded directly

01:03:46.574 --> 01:03:48.701
into the inferior vena cava,

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:52.413
or the superior vena cava.

01:03:52.622 --> 01:03:54.207
It's a matter of taste,
I think, don't you?

01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:57.502
<i>Then the tube moves
through the vein,</i>

01:03:57.752 --> 01:03:59.962
<i>under the crease of the arm,</i>

01:04:00.213 --> 01:04:03.257
into the vein that leads
directly into the heart.

01:04:03.466 --> 01:04:06.677
And then you just
hold up the legs

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:10.431
and you squeeze
the blood manually

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.726
into the tube from
the arms and the legs.

01:04:13.935 --> 01:04:16.020
There's little
shaking and pounding

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.355
at the end for the dregs.

01:04:17.522 --> 01:04:18.898
It isn't perfect.

01:04:20.066 --> 01:04:22.985
There's a little blood
left, I'm afraid.

01:04:23.236 --> 01:04:25.488
But, regardless,

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:31.077
the overall effect
is astonishing.

01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:34.622
And isn't that really
what counts in the end?

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:36.582
Yes, of course.

01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:40.294
Good showbiz,
Lieutenant, the effect!

01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:42.046
And then,

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:45.216
off comes the head

01:04:45.424 --> 01:04:48.594
without spilling one single

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:50.263
drop of blood.

01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:53.850
Now, I call that
showmanship, Lieutenant.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:58.271
Then of course, no one notices.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:00.231
Pearls before--

01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:01.691
(hand smashing face)

01:05:04.652 --> 01:05:08.823
Oh, a few boos from
the gallery, I see.

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:11.659
That's all right.

01:05:11.868 --> 01:05:12.785
I understand.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.288
I've been dull.

01:05:17.373 --> 01:05:18.749
Well,

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:22.920
I shall liven things up
for you a bit, Lieutenant.

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:24.922
The master

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.801
is throwing me
scrap from his table,

01:05:30.136 --> 01:05:32.638
a reward for faithful service,

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.934
something fun,

01:05:39.312 --> 01:05:43.149
something random,
something my way.

01:05:46.152 --> 01:05:47.486
Good night, moon.

01:05:48.571 --> 01:05:50.239
Good night, air.

01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:53.743
Good night, Amy.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.039
Telling her beads...

01:06:00.249 --> 01:06:01.250
Her beads...

01:06:23.064 --> 01:06:23.940
<i>(Kinderman)
He passed out.</i>

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:25.942
<i>(Nurse)
Again?</i>

01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:27.276
<i>My god, he's hemorrhaging.</i>

01:06:27.443 --> 01:06:28.903
The man in that cell,

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:30.321
knows the details

01:06:30.571 --> 01:06:32.865
of a murder of a girl named
Karen, happened years ago.

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.450
Yes?

01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:37.370
It was a Gemini killing that
never appeared in the papers.

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:40.623
<i>His goddamn nose is broken!</i>

01:06:40.873 --> 01:06:43.876
When I told you that the man
in cell 11 fell unconscious,

01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:45.962
you said something.

01:06:46.212 --> 01:06:46.879
Really?

01:06:48.089 --> 01:06:50.591
Yes, I think
you said, "Again?"

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.968
Might've done.

01:06:53.177 --> 01:06:55.054
Does that mean that
it's happened before?

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:56.555
Yes, it has.

01:06:56.722 --> 01:06:57.848
Many times?

01:06:58.891 --> 01:07:00.559
No, not really.

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:02.269
It's just been this week.

01:07:02.478 --> 01:07:05.189
I think the first
time was Sunday.

01:07:06.357 --> 01:07:07.942
And again?

01:07:08.192 --> 01:07:09.652
The next day.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.195
If you want exact times, it's--

01:07:11.362 --> 01:07:13.030
On your chart.

01:07:13.239 --> 01:07:14.240
Yes, that's right.

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:15.866
Any other times?

01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:20.496
Early yesterday morning,

01:07:20.705 --> 01:07:21.789
just before we found--

01:07:21.998 --> 01:07:23.582
Yes, that's all right.

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:25.001
I'm very sorry.

01:07:28.129 --> 01:07:32.800
When this happens, does
it seem like a normal sleep?

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.303
Nothing's normal
about that man.

01:07:36.554 --> 01:07:38.055
You seem a little
pleased about that.

01:07:38.264 --> 01:07:41.058
Well, it's quite unusual.

01:07:41.267 --> 01:07:44.687
His autonomic system
slows to a crawl,

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:47.398
his heartbeat, his temperature,

01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:50.276
his breathing,

01:07:50.443 --> 01:07:54.321
but his brain wave
activity accelerates.

01:07:55.865 --> 01:07:56.991
Accelerates?

01:07:58.159 --> 01:08:01.203
Okay, keep that on
until the weekend.

01:08:02.872 --> 01:08:04.415
You're most kind.

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:05.666
I'm a bitch.

01:08:09.045 --> 01:08:10.796
Have you ever told
the man in cell 11

01:08:10.963 --> 01:08:13.132
what happened to Father Dyer?

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.842
No, of course not.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:16.719
<i>Might anyone
else have told him?</i>

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.636
Why would they?

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:20.305
I don't know.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:21.932
I don't, either.

01:08:22.892 --> 01:08:24.435
Thanks again, Miss.

01:08:24.602 --> 01:08:26.312
Why did you hit him?

01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:31.984
Take it easy on that hand.

01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:32.943
I will.

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:36.529
"Save your servant."

01:08:39.992 --> 01:08:43.703
That's just something our
friend in cell 11 said one time.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.790
"Save your servant?"

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.957
Keeps running through my mind.

01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:49.710
An odd expression.

01:08:49.919 --> 01:08:51.670
What was odd was
how he said it.

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:53.046
How was that?

01:08:55.633 --> 01:08:58.969
It was just his
voice, it was different.

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.720
Different how?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:06.310
He sounded decent, nice,
completely different.

01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:09.270
And there was so much
emotion in his voice.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.189
He sounded,

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.901
I don't know, desperate.

01:09:14.693 --> 01:09:18.572
And what else has
he said in this voice?

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.492
Only one other thing.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.620
And what was that, Miss?

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.412
He said, "Kill it."

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:32.419
(footsteps echoing)

01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:39.069
"Save your servant who
trusts in you, my God.

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:40.321
"Let him find in you Lord,

01:10:40.571 --> 01:10:44.200
a fortified tower in
the face of the enemy."

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:54.293
<i>The Lord is my light
and my salvation.</i>

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:57.338
<i>The Lord is the
defender of my life.</i>

01:10:58.547 --> 01:10:59.506
My life...

01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:04.678
<i>"And Jesus said</i>

01:11:04.929 --> 01:11:07.640
<i>"to the man who was possessed,</i>

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.391
<i>"What is your name?</i>

01:11:10.643 --> 01:11:13.938
"And he answered, 'Legion,

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:17.191
for we are many.'"

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:23.656
Many.

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:34.333
(door closing)

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:46.262
Good night, Daddy.

01:11:46.512 --> 01:11:48.222
Good night, Julie dearest.

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:49.598
<i>It's so late.</i>

01:11:49.765 --> 01:11:53.727
Yes, it is, very late.

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:06.115
(growling)

01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:31.932
(rattling)

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:06.967
(door closes)

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.489
(creaking)

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.946
(ice cracking)

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:18.330
(screaming)

01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:19.581
God, can't I get any sleep?

01:14:19.832 --> 01:14:20.833
What the hell do you want?

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.376
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:24.795
Bad enough you wake me up at
half past five for breakfast.

01:14:24.962 --> 01:14:25.796
Sir, I'm sorry.

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:26.713
You're sorry?

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.132
I think you do this on purpose.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.092
What's your name?
I'm going to report you.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.011
My name is Amy
Keating, good night.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.598
(sighs)

01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:39.977
<i>Angels of mercy, horseshit.</i>

01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:43.439
(footsteps running away)

01:14:54.408 --> 01:14:58.120
(noisily rattling at desk)

01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:02.499
You all right?

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:03.959
Yeah.

01:15:04.168 --> 01:15:08.380
Yes, I'm fine, I'm just a
little jumpy, that's all.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.423
Okay.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.898
(grinding)

01:15:33.864 --> 01:15:35.824
(grinding continues)

01:15:50.881 --> 01:15:52.799
(keys jingling)

01:16:04.353 --> 01:16:07.898
(door creaks open
light clicks on)

01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:26.667
(light clicks off)

01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:32.089
(ominous rumbling,
screaming)

01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:09.501
She was slit down the middle,

01:17:11.253 --> 01:17:11.962
cut open,

01:17:13.589 --> 01:17:16.758
and all her vital
organs were removed.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.514
Then the killer
stuffed her body with

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:26.518
other materials and
sewed her back up.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.813
Other materials?

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:36.278
Rosaries, Catholic rosaries.

01:17:36.528 --> 01:17:38.363
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

01:17:44.953 --> 01:17:47.831
(ominous rumbling)

01:18:04.556 --> 01:18:06.558
Did you get my message?

01:18:08.435 --> 01:18:10.020
I left it with Keating.

01:18:11.313 --> 01:18:13.940
Nice girl, good heart.

01:18:14.358 --> 01:18:17.277
(machine rattling)

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:34.378
Yes, about this body of mine,

01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:36.755
friend of yours.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.179
<i>Well, there I was,
so awfully dead</i>

01:18:44.388 --> 01:18:45.764
<i>in that electric chair.</i>

01:18:46.014 --> 01:18:47.557
I didn't like it.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:49.017
Would you?

01:18:49.226 --> 01:18:50.352
It's upsetting!

01:18:51.436 --> 01:18:54.481
There was still so
much killing to do,

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:59.111
and there I was, in the
void without a body.

01:19:01.697 --> 01:19:03.281
But then along came,

01:19:05.158 --> 01:19:08.370
well, you know, my friend,

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:10.455
one of them,

01:19:10.664 --> 01:19:12.290
those others, there,

01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:14.292
the cruel ones,

01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:16.420
the master.

01:19:19.673 --> 01:19:20.799
And he thought

01:19:22.134 --> 01:19:24.636
that my work should continue,

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:28.432
but, in this body.

01:19:29.433 --> 01:19:33.729
In this body in
particular, in fact.

01:19:34.438 --> 01:19:38.567
Oh, let's call it revenge.

01:19:40.193 --> 01:19:41.862
A certain matter of an exorcism,

01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:44.823
I think in which your
friend, Father Karras

01:19:45.073 --> 01:19:49.119
expelled certain parties
from the body of a child.

01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:51.329
Certain parties
were not pleased,

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:52.873
to say the least,

01:19:54.249 --> 01:19:56.001
to say the very least,

01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:01.423
and so my friend, the master

01:20:02.299 --> 01:20:07.220
devised this pretty little
scheme as a way of getting back,

01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:10.849
of creating a stumbling block,

01:20:11.141 --> 01:20:12.934
a scandal,

01:20:13.894 --> 01:20:18.648
a horror to the eyes of all men
who seek faith, using

01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:23.361
the body of this saintly
priest as an instrument of...

01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:26.323
Well, you know my work.

01:20:26.573 --> 01:20:29.159
But, the main thing,

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:34.623
is the torment of your
friend, Father Karras,

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:37.834
as he watches while I rip,

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:41.630
and cut, and mutilate
the innocent!

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:42.923
His friends!

01:20:43.173 --> 01:20:45.759
And again, and again!

01:20:46.051 --> 01:20:47.928
And on and on!

01:20:48.428 --> 01:20:51.014
He is inside with us!

01:20:51.515 --> 01:20:54.351
He will never get away!

01:20:54.559 --> 01:20:57.270
His pain won't end!

01:20:58.146 --> 01:21:00.106
(growling)

01:21:06.947 --> 01:21:10.283
Oh, gracious me,

01:21:11.326 --> 01:21:12.911
was I raving?

01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:19.459
Please forgive me.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.212
I'm mad.

01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:27.509
Let's see,

01:21:29.511 --> 01:21:30.470
where was I?

01:21:32.556 --> 01:21:36.017
Oh, yes, the master.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:39.312
He was kind, you see.

01:21:40.397 --> 01:21:44.484
He brought me to our mutual
acquaintance, Father Karras.

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:47.529
Not too well at the time,

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:53.159
I'm afraid he was passing on
in the dying mode as we say.

01:21:54.369 --> 01:21:59.457
So, as Karras was about to

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:02.377
slip out of his body

01:22:02.586 --> 01:22:03.503
Is this true?

01:22:04.713 --> 01:22:08.633
The master was slipping me in.

01:22:09.593 --> 01:22:11.219
Oh now, there was some confusion

01:22:11.428 --> 01:22:14.222
when the medics said
that Karras was dead.

01:22:14.472 --> 01:22:18.226
I mean, he was dead,
technically speaking.

01:22:18.476 --> 01:22:20.896
<i>I mean, his time was up.</i>

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.523
<i>He wanted out,</i>

01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:26.359
but I was in.

01:22:27.319 --> 01:22:29.529
A little traumatized, true.

01:22:29.738 --> 01:22:33.366
I mean, after all,
his brain was jelly,

01:22:34.117 --> 01:22:36.119
lack of oxygen and all
that sort of thing.

01:22:36.369 --> 01:22:37.537
You understand?

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:43.126
It took a maximum effort

01:22:43.335 --> 01:22:46.838
that at last got me out of
that cheap little coffin!

01:22:48.548 --> 01:22:50.759
Vow of poverty, disgusting.

01:22:52.427 --> 01:22:53.386
Never mind.

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:59.017
Toward the end, a little

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:01.728
slapstick and comic relief

01:23:01.937 --> 01:23:04.731
when that old Brother Fain
who was tending the body,

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.942
saw me climbing from the coffin.

01:23:07.192 --> 01:23:09.986
(laughing)

01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:13.031
It's the smiles that keep
us going, don't you think?

01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:16.618
The little giggles and
bits of good cheer.

01:23:18.328 --> 01:23:19.079
But then,

01:23:20.497 --> 01:23:24.751
after that, it was all blue
Mondays for a while, I'm afraid.

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:29.756
<i>So much damage to
Karras' brain cells.</i>

01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.717
So many lost.

01:23:35.845 --> 01:23:39.224
It's not enough, you
see, to be a spirit.

01:23:41.101 --> 01:23:42.477
There's no magic.

01:23:43.478 --> 01:23:46.106
In this artificial box
that you call a world,

01:23:46.356 --> 01:23:50.151
we cannot touch except through
bodies, you understand?

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.530
We must operate through
neurologic systems,

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.824
brains that function,
and your friend's

01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:58.201
was nearly past resurrection.

01:23:59.828 --> 01:24:02.580
It was quite an
effort to regenerate

01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:05.000
his puny little brain cells.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:09.045
It took me 15 years!

01:24:11.548 --> 01:24:14.134
So many years.

01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:21.266
Oh, I'm just a traveling man,

01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:26.021
one who moves.

01:24:26.521 --> 01:24:29.566
(thunder rolling)

01:24:32.736 --> 01:24:34.738
I have dreams of a rose,

01:24:36.448 --> 01:24:39.826
and falling down a
long flight of stairs.

01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:49.044
I don't believe you're
the Gemini Killer.

01:24:49.919 --> 01:24:55.133
Oh, you are issuing a clear
invitation to the dance.

01:24:55.383 --> 01:24:56.593
What does that mean?

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.761
Never mind.

01:25:00.096 --> 01:25:03.808
Incidentally, don't blame
me for that idiot Temple.

01:25:04.059 --> 01:25:05.185
That was a suicide.

01:25:05.435 --> 01:25:07.854
The man was a lunatic weakling.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.316
Still, he helped me.

01:25:12.984 --> 01:25:14.194
Are there services?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.279
I would like to attend.

01:25:17.906 --> 01:25:19.115
Temple helped you?

01:25:19.282 --> 01:25:20.909
Yes, of course!

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:22.702
He brought you to me.

01:25:24.579 --> 01:25:28.625
<i>I told him if he failed to
convince you to come to me</i>

01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:32.420
<i>that he would suffer
in unspeakable ways.</i>

01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:36.800
"Pain that cannot be
imagined," I said.

01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:40.970
Poor superstitious
fool, he believed me,

01:25:41.221 --> 01:25:43.640
<i>but he couldn't take the
pressure it would seem.</i>

01:25:43.848 --> 01:25:44.599
What pressure?

01:25:45.433 --> 01:25:47.894
The pressure of inimitable me.

01:25:49.979 --> 01:25:53.691
Some other tasks I said
I had in mind for him,

01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:57.946
things, little things.

01:26:00.115 --> 01:26:03.159
Did Temple get you
out of this cell?

01:26:07.413 --> 01:26:08.915
<i>Who gets you out?</i>

01:26:13.962 --> 01:26:15.839
Just friends,

01:26:18.091 --> 01:26:20.718
old friends.

01:26:32.313 --> 01:26:34.983
Tell the press

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:38.570
that I am the
Gemini, Lieutenant,

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:39.904
final warning.

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:45.577
<i>Incidentally, I can help.</i>

01:26:46.494 --> 01:26:47.662
Help what?

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:53.084
Your unbelief.

01:26:56.129 --> 01:26:56.963
I'm tired.

01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:01.509
I am so tired.

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:07.515
<i>(Damien)
Bill, help me.</i>

01:27:30.038 --> 01:27:30.705
Damien?

01:27:30.955 --> 01:27:31.915
No!

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:34.959
(ominous rumbling)

01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:43.551
Little Jack Horner,

01:27:49.599 --> 01:27:51.559
child's play, Lieutenant.

01:27:52.727 --> 01:27:55.271
Father Morning, please.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.398
<i>Jimmy, I can't read this.</i>

01:27:57.607 --> 01:28:00.276
Korner, K-O-R-N-E-R.

01:28:00.443 --> 01:28:01.861
I'll call again.

01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:03.196
See you later, alligator.

01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:04.322
<i>[Nurse With Patient]
Come on sweetheart,</i>

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:06.741
<i>let's go back to your room.</i>

01:28:07.575 --> 01:28:09.202
<i>Just take your time.</i>

01:28:10.245 --> 01:28:11.079
<i>That's it.</i>

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.665
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:28:17.502 --> 01:28:19.837
<i>(Kinderman)
How do you get out of here?</i>

01:28:20.004 --> 01:28:22.840
<i>(Gemini)
Old friends, old friends.</i>

01:28:24.259 --> 01:28:27.553
<i>I'm a traveling
man, one who moves.</i>

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.556
<i>Old friends, one who moves.</i>

01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:32.850
<i>One who moves, one who...</i>

01:28:37.522 --> 01:28:39.440
(indistinct chatter)

01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:45.947
I didn't hear it,
say it again, will you?

01:28:46.197 --> 01:28:49.284
Yeah, and I...
(mumbling)

01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:08.386
(ominous rumbling)

01:29:17.562 --> 01:29:20.315
(ominous music)

01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:00.646
(ominous music)

01:30:32.678 --> 01:30:33.471
Hit the lights!

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:34.138
Mommy!

01:30:34.347 --> 01:30:35.515
<i>God almighty!</i>

01:30:35.681 --> 01:30:36.808
<i>What the hell do you
think you're doing?</i>

01:30:37.016 --> 01:30:37.934
Are you crazy?

01:30:38.184 --> 01:30:40.520
What on Earth is
the matter with you?

01:30:40.728 --> 01:30:42.230
I want my mommy.

01:30:42.438 --> 01:30:43.022
Just toys.

01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:44.941
Is that a crime?

01:30:45.191 --> 01:30:46.734
He's after someone, who?

01:30:46.984 --> 01:30:50.238
You treat your own
family like this?

01:30:50.405 --> 01:30:52.240
Aren't you leaving?

01:30:52.448 --> 01:30:56.119
Please leave, I cannot
wait for you to leave!

01:30:57.328 --> 01:31:01.999
Oh, you are issuing a clear
invitation to the dance,

01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:04.168
<i>to the dance, to the dance...</i>

01:31:04.419 --> 01:31:05.420
Julie.

01:31:05.628 --> 01:31:08.047
(phone ringing)

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:10.133
Hello.

01:31:11.384 --> 01:31:12.802
<i>Bill.</i>

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:14.220
Hiya, honey.

01:31:14.429 --> 01:31:15.221
Where...

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:18.474
Uh-huh.

01:31:18.641 --> 01:31:21.561
(busy signal beeping)

01:31:24.313 --> 01:31:25.189
Uh-huh.

01:31:26.399 --> 01:31:27.650
Okay, sweetheart.

01:31:30.361 --> 01:31:31.821
That was Bill.

01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:34.282
There's a nurse coming
over with a package.

01:31:43.583 --> 01:31:45.835
Danny, get in the car!

01:31:46.002 --> 01:31:48.921
Roll it, roll it,
move it, move it, go, go!

01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:53.134
(sirens blaring,
wheels squealing)

01:32:05.813 --> 01:32:08.524
(ominous music)

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:16.824

(sirens blaring,
wheels squealing)

01:32:40.431 --> 01:32:41.098
Go around!

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.603
Ram it if you have to!

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:46.729
Ram it.

01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:49.357
Back up, you son of a, get out!

01:33:02.161 --> 01:33:02.954
Go!

01:33:07.208 --> 01:33:09.252
(doorbell ringing)

01:33:09.502 --> 01:33:10.670
That must be the nurse.

01:33:10.878 --> 01:33:13.589
(machine ticking)

01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:22.431
(growling)

01:33:28.813 --> 01:33:30.982
(wheels squealing)

01:33:32.191 --> 01:33:33.818
Go around the back!

01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:47.373
Oh, hi, Dad.

01:33:47.582 --> 01:33:49.250
Mother, Daddy's home.

01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:50.501
What's this?

01:33:53.462 --> 01:33:55.423
Billy, what's going on?

01:33:56.799 --> 01:33:58.759
I'm crazy, that's
the only explanation.

01:33:58.968 --> 01:33:59.885
Well, you're honest.

01:34:00.094 --> 01:34:01.846
Let's start from
the beginning.

01:34:02.054 --> 01:34:02.763
It's alright.

01:34:02.972 --> 01:34:04.265
No, it isn't alright.

01:34:04.557 --> 01:34:06.434
What's this nurse thing?

01:34:06.601 --> 01:34:07.560
What nurse?

01:34:07.768 --> 01:34:08.561
I'm so tired.

01:34:08.769 --> 01:34:09.937
Oh hi, Stevie!

01:34:10.146 --> 01:34:10.813
Yeah, how'd it go?

01:34:11.022 --> 01:34:11.606
Julie!

01:34:11.814 --> 01:34:12.898
Daddy, I'm talking.

01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:14.358
Sorry, Steve, I missed that.

01:34:14.567 --> 01:34:15.443
Bill,

01:34:15.651 --> 01:34:17.486
what kind of a nurse is this?

01:34:17.695 --> 01:34:21.073
I open the door for
the woman, she faints.

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.742
<i>And then when she wakes up,</i>

01:34:23.034 --> 01:34:25.745
<i>she says, "When is it bedtime?"</i>

01:34:27.622 --> 01:34:29.290
Please help me.

01:34:32.251 --> 01:34:33.294
Is it bedtime?

01:34:34.128 --> 01:34:37.465
So is she staying
for dinner or what?

01:34:37.715 --> 01:34:40.051
It's okay, Danny, we're good.

01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:44.221
(ominous music)

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.848

I've been waiting
for you, Lieutenant.

01:34:55.066 --> 01:34:57.193
I wanted you to see this.

01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:12.101
