00:12.742 --> 00:15.742
(crickets chirping)

04:43.515 --> 04:46.515
(light piano music)

06:18.955 --> 06:21.705
(birds chirping)

06:32.302 --> 06:34.802
(light music)

07:56.004 --> 07:58.504
(music stops)

08:11.809 --> 08:14.809
(light piano music)

08:31.837 --> 08:34.587
(steps clacking)

08:50.471 --> 08:51.890
- Why are you wearing smart shoes?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.800
This isn't a smart job.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.530
- You didn't tell me anything.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.033
- Well I told you to wear boots.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.450
- No, you didn't.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.333
- Yes, I did.

09:00.230 --> 09:02.130
- No, you told me to create a low profile

09:02.130 --> 09:04.750
whilst also maintaining the image,

09:04.750 --> 09:06.020
- That we mean business.

09:06.020 --> 09:07.260
- Those were your exact words.

09:07.260 --> 09:10.787
- And what says business more than boots?

09:10.787 --> 09:11.937
- That is such a shite.

09:12.890 --> 09:15.440
You can't just give me one
sentence's worth of description

09:15.440 --> 09:17.290
and expect me to have it nailed down.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.080
Why do people talk to
you again, and not me?

09:20.080 --> 09:22.030
- Because I'm the approachable one,

09:22.030 --> 09:23.390
and occasionally, once in my life

09:23.390 --> 09:24.767
I actually like to smile.

09:24.767 --> 09:25.620
- Yeah, right.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.532
- Yeah, see, that's what I mean,

09:26.532 --> 09:28.065
right there, fucking unapproachable.

09:28.065 --> 09:29.267
- God.

09:29.267 --> 09:31.490
- Did you even bother to bring a gun?

09:31.490 --> 09:33.290
- You didn't tell me to bring a gun.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.940
- Would you not have
thought it been a good idea

09:35.940 --> 09:38.420
to compensate seeing that I'm
the one who usually carries

09:38.420 --> 09:41.070
and mine was thrown in the
river last week by Marcus?

09:41.070 --> 09:42.970
Now we're gonna be going in unarmed.

09:42.970 --> 09:44.233
Well done, dickhead.

09:45.330 --> 09:46.820
- So it is a break-in then?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.850
- Well that's besides the point.

09:48.850 --> 09:49.800
- There I was thinking we'd be

09:49.800 --> 09:52.580
going back to doing entertainment
at kids birthday parties.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.508
- Well no one wants you
for entertainment, do they?

09:54.508 --> 09:57.707
- (laughing) Yeah, yeah.

09:57.707 --> 09:59.690
- Right, okay, story time.

09:59.690 --> 10:00.860
So there's this guy.

10:00.860 --> 10:03.540
Let's call him Some
Fucker Who's Gonna Get It.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.743
He's an actor.

10:04.743 --> 10:07.603
He's a failed actor actually
but he's a swell guy.

10:07.603 --> 10:10.390
You know what, let's
just call him Swell Guy.

10:10.390 --> 10:12.470
Swell Guy goes for an audition

10:12.470 --> 10:13.930
but he bottles it.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.730
He bottles it worse than
when you bottled that guy

10:15.730 --> 10:18.520
with that top shelf bottle of
tequila in the club last week.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.190
- I'd forgotten about that, yeah.

10:21.190 --> 10:22.023
Bad comparison.

10:22.023 --> 10:24.563
- You know, I never really
did say thank you for that.

10:24.563 --> 10:25.440
- Well it was either that

10:25.440 --> 10:27.990
or you light up the entire
club with a machine gun.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.433
It is probably best
you're not carrying, Cary.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.995
- On to our Swell Guy.

10:33.995 --> 10:35.668
Now I don't know if he
was having a bad day

10:35.668 --> 10:36.713
before that audition

10:36.713 --> 10:38.627
or if that just throws something off more.

10:38.627 --> 10:39.957
But after he left there,

10:39.957 --> 10:42.327
it was only gonna get worse from there.

10:42.327 --> 10:43.528
- I know,

10:43.528 --> 10:45.490
he kept staring at us.

10:45.490 --> 10:47.500
- After the audition on the way home,

10:47.500 --> 10:49.450
the Swell Guy gets a call

10:49.450 --> 10:52.113
saying that his poor dear
beloved brother has died.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.230
Now to make matters worse,

10:55.230 --> 10:58.750
on the way back, some
poor sod tries to mug him.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.810
Now, due to the quite understandable state

11:01.810 --> 11:02.843
the Swell Guy is in,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.210
you quite understand that he
goes to pound town on the guy

11:06.210 --> 11:07.410
and not in the good way.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.330
Now it just so happens
that this is perhaps,

11:12.330 --> 11:14.310
no, it is the worst mistake

11:15.150 --> 11:19.180
that Swell Guy has ever, or
will ever make in his life.

11:19.180 --> 11:22.080
'Cause it just so happens the
guy he goes to pound town on

11:23.271 --> 11:27.160
happens to have enough
wealth and money and contacts

11:27.160 --> 11:28.810
to hire me,

11:28.810 --> 11:32.283
Legendary Cary and his
trusty sidekick James Wright.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.650
And that is how Swell Guy turns into

11:38.650 --> 11:40.200
Some Fucker Who's Gonna Get It.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.980
- So how did you know he
wants to become an actor?

11:43.980 --> 11:46.540
- Well I've been observing
him for the last few days

11:46.540 --> 11:48.490
and he's been reading a
piece of paper on his own.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.822
So either he's an actor or he's a psycho.

11:51.822 --> 11:52.655
- Or he's both.

11:52.655 --> 11:54.740
- Well then, we should be charging double.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.720
- And how'd you know the brother was dead?

11:56.720 --> 11:58.063
- Our employer told me

11:58.063 --> 12:00.680
that the brother was no
longer part of the equation,

12:00.680 --> 12:03.240
so I made the natural and
professional assumption

12:03.240 --> 12:05.310
that the brother was dead.

12:05.310 --> 12:08.581
- And the person who is employing us is?

12:08.581 --> 12:09.730
- Faulkner.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.780
- As in the Faulkner?

12:12.100 --> 12:15.330
- As in his son, Faulkner Junior.

12:15.330 --> 12:16.860
When his father moved to the country

12:16.860 --> 12:18.580
he took over the business.

12:18.580 --> 12:21.580
Find he's even more erratic and
irrational than his old man.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.383
And he pays double.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.250
- [James] Well, that would make
sense, there are two of us.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.300
- [Cary] Double each.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.663
- [James] How much exactly is that?

12:30.663 --> 12:32.300
- [Cary] We have money people who sort it

12:32.300 --> 12:34.080
so I don't know exactly what it is.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.772
- [James] Money people?

12:35.772 --> 12:37.220
It definitely means he can pay us.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.400
- Exactly.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.660
That means he can afford the best

12:39.660 --> 12:41.280
so he can afford to snuff out the best.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.340
That means we can't mess this up.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.173
- Do you remember, mate,

12:44.173 --> 12:46.203
when we first started out doing this?

12:47.470 --> 12:49.840
We were beating up rich dickheads and

12:50.860 --> 12:52.770
thieving richer dickheads.

12:52.770 --> 12:53.970
The pay was pretty good.

12:55.332 --> 12:57.340
It was kind of fun, but let's be real,

12:57.340 --> 12:58.590
we're not going anywhere.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.003
- I don't know, I'm pretty content.

13:02.003 --> 13:06.810
- Well mate, content is just stale.

13:06.810 --> 13:09.972
- And what word would
you have me use, then?

13:09.972 --> 13:12.970
- What's that word for
people who live in the past?

13:12.970 --> 13:14.339
- Nostalgic?

13:14.339 --> 13:15.470
- Uh huh.

13:15.470 --> 13:17.440
- I'll take that.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.000
- I didn't mean it as a compliment.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.938
- Yeah, but see, I'm taking it as one.

13:20.938 --> 13:23.887
That's the difference between you and me.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.560
There's no mystery left
in the world, no intrigue.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.613
There's no passion.

13:29.590 --> 13:32.060
People just go and do
their everyday lives,

13:32.060 --> 13:34.110
start in the morning, end in the evening.

13:36.220 --> 13:37.733
We're out of time, you and me.

13:40.003 --> 13:41.290
Literally.

13:41.290 --> 13:43.180
It's nearly nine o'clock.

13:43.180 --> 13:44.880
He'll becoming back from his walk.

13:45.799 --> 13:47.113
When we get back, you
and me are gonna have

13:47.113 --> 13:48.536
a proper chat about this.

13:48.536 --> 13:53.536
No doubt about it.

14:20.180 --> 14:22.430
(knocking)

14:36.421 --> 14:41.421
It's time for you to work your magic.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.017
Oh, by the way,

14:44.278 --> 14:47.761
Faulkner says that he wants him alive.

14:47.761 --> 14:51.958
- [James] I think you're
supposed to tell me earlier.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.458
(tense music)

15:33.626 --> 15:34.793
- [Cary] Shit.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.127
- So we've got another job.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.681
(lightly tense music)

16:43.753 --> 16:45.113
- [Man] Hello.

16:45.113 --> 16:45.946
- Hi.

16:46.870 --> 16:49.270
- Are you the man with
the big house by the sea?

16:50.490 --> 16:51.460
I'm Richard, by the way.

16:51.460 --> 16:54.030
I just got the run down
castle next to yours.

16:54.030 --> 16:55.537
- We don't usually get a lot
of new people around here.

16:55.537 --> 16:57.010
- By the looks of things,

16:57.010 --> 16:59.280
you don't get any people around here.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.750
So, how did you manage to
get such a nice location?

17:02.750 --> 17:04.653
- [Writer] Well, I used to write.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.090
- Oh, well, I've been
around enough of you lot

17:08.090 --> 17:10.620
to know that I should never
ask what you're writing about.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.647
But I probably will at some point.

17:12.647 --> 17:15.403
Despite that, I'm not
a big fan of reading.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.053
But I'm sure whatever
you did was pretty good.

17:18.053 --> 17:20.360
It got you the house, didn't it?

17:20.360 --> 17:21.440
- Yeah.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.880
Yeah it was.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.330
- So what do you do now?

17:28.070 --> 17:29.153
Retired then?

17:30.160 --> 17:31.480
- I like writing.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.860
But the writing doesn't seem to like me.

17:33.860 --> 17:34.913
Not recently, anyway.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.535
- [Richard] What, so you
come here every morning

17:37.535 --> 17:38.670
looking for a bit of inspiration

17:38.670 --> 17:40.810
from the calming waters of nature?

17:40.810 --> 17:44.290
- And silence, usually.

17:44.290 --> 17:47.240
- Well, so you like your isolation then?

17:47.240 --> 17:50.700
- [Writer] I'd like anything
that'd enable me to write.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.710
- Well, I respect that commitment.

17:52.710 --> 17:54.370
There are few people
with that kind of focus.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.550
Well, in my experience anyway.

17:56.550 --> 17:57.470
- [Writer] Thanks.

17:57.470 --> 18:00.100
- I'm quite fond of isolation myself.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.995
If I spend too much time with people

18:01.995 --> 18:04.120
I tend to go a bit insane.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.170
Well, especially the sort of
person I usually hang out with.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.660
You should come take a look
at my house at some point.

18:10.660 --> 18:13.530
It's old and empty, probably haunted.

18:13.530 --> 18:14.840
But you never know,

18:14.840 --> 18:17.290
might get a bit of
inspiration for your new book.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.180
- I'll try anything at this point.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.460
(tense music)

18:23.460 --> 18:26.260
- Well, this is certainly an
interesting turn of events.

18:27.510 --> 18:29.503
What the fuck are we supposed to do now?

18:50.514 --> 18:51.347
- Well.

18:54.697 --> 18:58.170
We could go and collect the money

18:58.170 --> 19:01.940
for this half of the job.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.840
And then call in an
anonymous tip to the police

19:04.840 --> 19:07.140
and let them come in and
finish it off for us.

19:08.988 --> 19:10.212
But I have a feeling neither of us

19:10.212 --> 19:11.175
wants to do that.

19:11.175 --> 19:12.008
- Nice.

19:12.008 --> 19:14.540
Faulkner wanted him
alive so we can't do it.

19:14.540 --> 19:15.970
And if the police find out about this,

19:15.970 --> 19:17.080
they're gonna think we've done it

19:17.080 --> 19:19.060
so we're fucked either way.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.253
We've gotta do this.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.023
- Throw around them

19:23.023 --> 19:24.510
and get justice for Swell Guy.

19:24.510 --> 19:25.888
- So he's some Swell Guy again?

19:25.888 --> 19:27.210
- What, he got it, didn't he?

19:27.210 --> 19:28.887
- Find who killed him,

19:28.887 --> 19:31.246
and find how we did it,

19:31.246 --> 19:33.303
and we can bring this guy to justice.

19:35.468 --> 19:37.385
I mean he did kill him.

19:39.241 --> 19:40.908
- Okay, let's do it.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.107
Lock the doors, search the house.

20:01.759 --> 20:03.824
(light music)

20:03.824 --> 20:06.060
- How the hell'd you
get a place like this?

20:06.060 --> 20:07.580
- Yeah, I know, it's strange.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.898
The previous owner just
built this, a sort of hotel.

20:10.898 --> 20:13.010
And he had a vision,

20:13.010 --> 20:15.600
kept on making more
and more modifications.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.920
Tried to add a pool, extra rooms.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.190
But eventually, either
he just ran out of money

20:20.190 --> 20:21.270
or conviction, like you,

20:21.270 --> 20:22.793
and he just left.

20:24.110 --> 20:25.810
And obviously no one in their right mind

20:25.810 --> 20:27.140
would ever buy this place.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.400
So I did.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.030
And it was ridiculously cheap.

20:31.030 --> 20:31.863
- Why?

20:31.863 --> 20:32.696
- It's interesting.

20:32.696 --> 20:35.560
I mean, it's a bit bougie, barbaric,

20:35.560 --> 20:36.400
but it's not boring.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.170
Are you taking notes?

20:38.170 --> 20:41.230
Amidst all this, I think I can
find something interesting.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.773
I've got money to spend and

20:43.908 --> 20:45.780
I just have too many houses.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.511
I'm a house hoarder.

20:47.511 --> 20:49.563
All right, on with the tour.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, I know it's strange

20:53.000 --> 20:55.856
but I'm not a psycho, trust me.

20:55.856 --> 20:59.052
I just want to enjoy
my very own retirement.

20:59.052 --> 21:00.860
I mean, I can afford it.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.420
- So what'd you do before?

21:03.420 --> 21:05.007
- I was a thief.

21:05.007 --> 21:06.200
- Are you joking?

21:06.200 --> 21:08.600
- No, if I was joking, that
wouldn't be very funny.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.110
People were hurt, but never me

21:11.110 --> 21:12.620
because I was good.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.890
I was very good.

21:13.890 --> 21:14.910
- Also very humble.

21:14.910 --> 21:17.030
- No, no, honest.

21:17.030 --> 21:18.150
If you're gonna be good at something

21:18.150 --> 21:19.420
you might as well let people know.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.780
I mean, they're gonna find out either way.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.930
But I would appreciate it

21:23.930 --> 21:25.690
if you wouldn't tell anyone about this.

21:25.690 --> 21:28.810
I don't really want to be the
talk of the town just yet.

21:28.810 --> 21:30.050
- I've got no one to tell.

21:30.050 --> 21:30.960
- Perfect.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.510
In my experience, the quiet ones

21:32.510 --> 21:33.900
are always more trustworthy.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.300
The loudmouths, not so much.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.933
So you probably shouldn't trust me.

21:39.112 --> 21:41.612
(tense music)

21:52.880 --> 21:54.810
- What are you doing?

21:54.810 --> 21:55.710
- It's a nice tie.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.510
He doesn't need it.

22:02.148 --> 22:04.888
(door knocking)

22:04.888 --> 22:07.888
(music intensifies)

22:08.722 --> 22:11.760
(letter clacking)

22:11.760 --> 22:16.760
- So this was, and will be
at some point, the bedroom.

22:17.575 --> 22:19.515
- What the hell happened here?

22:19.515 --> 22:21.190
- Well this is the part of the house

22:21.190 --> 22:22.923
the last owner never refinished.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.403
He gave up, but I won't.

22:29.350 --> 22:30.500
This is the last of it.

22:31.944 --> 22:33.450
Have you enjoyed the tour?

22:33.450 --> 22:34.283
- Yeah.

22:35.470 --> 22:36.590
Nice place.

22:36.590 --> 22:38.080
Is this everything?

22:38.080 --> 22:40.030
- Yeah, you've seen everything.

22:40.030 --> 22:41.433
- There must be a cellar.

22:42.350 --> 22:43.524
- No, I don't think so.

22:43.524 --> 22:44.470
I saw the blueprints.

22:44.470 --> 22:45.303
- You sure?

22:46.230 --> 22:47.063
- Yeah.

22:54.772 --> 22:57.439
- There's something behind here.

22:58.672 --> 23:00.594
(tense music)

23:00.594 --> 23:01.670
- (sighing) It's all right.

23:01.670 --> 23:03.913
It's the apartment guy, the concierge.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.657
(ripping)

23:19.240 --> 23:21.093
It's a bank statement.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.564
Who has their bank statements
mailed to them anymore?

23:24.564 --> 23:25.453
- I do.

23:25.453 --> 23:27.560
I don't trust online banking.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.837
It takes five years to set it up

23:28.837 --> 23:31.420
and then another five to
connect to the printer.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.253
- [James] God, a couple
more years with you,

23:32.253 --> 23:34.132
we'll both be in Cameroon.

23:34.132 --> 23:34.965
- Haha.

23:36.310 --> 23:37.143
- [James] Say what, the accounts

23:37.143 --> 23:38.630
that's on display is unrivaled.

23:40.192 --> 23:41.745
- Why don't you check
the rest of the mail?

23:41.745 --> 23:44.245
I'll go check the rest of the house.

23:44.245 --> 23:47.115
- [Richard] I just can't believe it.

23:47.115 --> 23:48.360
- [Writer] Well fuck it then, let's go.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.150
(ominous music)

23:50.150 --> 23:52.067
- All right, after you.

24:04.947 --> 24:07.313
- His name was Gordon Bale, by the way.

24:08.433 --> 24:12.353
Loos like Gordon really
liked ordering food and

24:13.400 --> 24:15.543
instead of cooking or
going out for dinner.

24:16.700 --> 24:20.210
More importantly, Gordon
made a rather significant

24:20.210 --> 24:23.193
cash withdrawal three days ago.

24:24.580 --> 24:27.189
We need to find out what he
might have bought with that.

24:27.189 --> 24:28.380
- [Cary] James?

24:28.380 --> 24:29.583
- Yeah?

24:29.583 --> 24:30.486
- [Cary] Come here.

24:30.486 --> 24:31.903
I found a drawer.

24:33.371 --> 24:34.204
- What?

24:39.482 --> 24:41.643
- Is that what an author
would call an anticlimax?

24:41.643 --> 24:43.810
- It's what anyone would
call an anticlimax.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.503
- How did you know there
was a room in there?

24:46.503 --> 24:49.820
- Crime fiction, hidden
doors, hand in hand.

24:49.820 --> 24:50.653
- [James] Gun?

24:51.680 --> 24:52.710
- Looks like it didn't protect him

24:52.710 --> 24:54.260
as well as he thought it would.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.720
- That's our lead. We need
to find out who sold him that

24:57.720 --> 24:59.570
and then we're really onto something.

25:01.060 --> 25:01.893
- Arthur.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.063
- He could help us.

25:07.450 --> 25:08.283
But would he?

25:10.690 --> 25:12.340
- As a matter of fact,

25:12.340 --> 25:15.350
I don't think that was an anticlimax.

25:15.350 --> 25:17.430
In fact, I think it was perfect.

25:17.430 --> 25:19.510
I have the skill, you have the knowledge.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.700
And you need the inspiration.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.510
It's way better than staring
at ducks all day, trust me.

25:24.510 --> 25:25.800
If you do this with me,

25:25.800 --> 25:28.780
you'll be churning out
masterpieces in no time.

25:28.780 --> 25:30.960
- I thought you're retired.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.060
- Old habits die hard.

25:33.050 --> 25:33.983
- Oh.

25:34.870 --> 25:35.820
Because of last time.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.440
- Yeah, because of last time.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.400
- Well, Arthur's a big boy.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.790
He can get over this sort of thing.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.210
Anyway, it's bad for
business if you hold grudges.

25:45.210 --> 25:49.160
- Look, if what we know
about this Faulkner is true

25:49.160 --> 25:51.600
and he gets wind of this situation,

25:51.600 --> 25:54.640
he'll know that we haven't
completed the jobs to his specs.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.400
And when that happens,
we're gonna end up like him.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.160
You know where Arthur is,

25:59.160 --> 26:00.970
you know who Arthur is.

26:00.970 --> 26:02.840
If you go there,
Faulkner's men are probably

26:02.840 --> 26:04.363
gonna be swarming the place.

26:05.540 --> 26:07.890
Let's be honest, Arthur
might just rat you out.

26:08.740 --> 26:09.703
- James.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.450
Do you know anyone who's got anywhere

26:12.450 --> 26:14.960
without taking the necessary risks?

26:14.960 --> 26:16.680
- Well I know a lot of people
who've gone to the morgue

26:16.680 --> 26:18.743
by taking necessary risks.

26:19.748 --> 26:20.581
- Fair enough.

26:20.581 --> 26:22.120
- And tell how much of an idiot you were

26:22.120 --> 26:23.240
at your funeral.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.170
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

26:24.170 --> 26:25.460
You keep searching here

26:25.460 --> 26:28.240
and we'll meet back at the office in say,

26:28.240 --> 26:29.498
- Three hours.

26:29.498 --> 26:30.331
- Three hours.

26:30.331 --> 26:31.164
- [James] Not two.

26:31.164 --> 26:31.997
- Not two.

26:31.997 --> 26:32.830
- Three hours.

26:32.830 --> 26:33.663
- [Cary] Three.

26:33.663 --> 26:34.496
- At the office.

26:34.496 --> 26:35.840
- [Cary] At the office.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.790
- In three hours.

26:36.790 --> 26:38.850
- Jesus Christ!

26:38.850 --> 26:41.240
Yes, three hours.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.130
- Don't die.

26:42.130 --> 26:42.963
- [Cary] I won't.

26:42.963 --> 26:44.510
- But if you do, I'll
haunt your fucking ghost.

26:44.510 --> 26:45.620
- So what do you say?

26:45.620 --> 26:46.890
One job, not a bank.

26:46.890 --> 26:48.820
Just a house, something easy,

26:48.820 --> 26:50.940
enough to get your blood pumping.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.870
You've been writing about it for so long.

26:52.870 --> 26:54.990
Take the next logical step.

26:54.990 --> 26:56.823
It'll make you feel so alive.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.103
- Oh.

27:03.190 --> 27:04.560
Be careful.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.520
Faulkner's the kind of person
who has a contingency plan

27:07.520 --> 27:09.363
against these sort of things.

27:13.079 --> 27:14.593
(door shutting)

27:14.593 --> 27:17.176
(pen clicking)

27:18.740 --> 27:20.577
- How about you try,

27:20.577 --> 27:23.493
"It was a cold and lonely night."

27:24.520 --> 27:25.353
- Sorry, what?

27:25.353 --> 27:27.110
- I'm not the fucking poet.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.030
Just write some words in random order.

27:29.030 --> 27:30.590
It can't be that hard.

27:30.590 --> 27:32.380
Just do something.

27:32.380 --> 27:33.550
- Trust me.

27:33.550 --> 27:34.557
There's nothing I hate more

27:34.557 --> 27:36.560
than indecisiveness and inaction.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.313
- Yes, that's the mentality.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.940
- Hang on, why are we doing this now?

27:40.940 --> 27:42.340
Shouldn't we be talking about our

27:42.340 --> 27:43.790
imminent breaking of the law?

27:45.140 --> 27:46.960
- Okay, fine.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.310
First we enter the house.

27:48.310 --> 27:49.330
Leave that to me.

27:49.330 --> 27:50.840
Then you take something,

27:50.840 --> 27:51.930
hopefully you can do that yourself.

27:51.930 --> 27:56.320
- We take something too
trivial to be noticed but has,

27:56.320 --> 27:58.630
- [Richard] Enough butter
to grease a monkey.

27:58.630 --> 27:59.940
- They call me the writer.

27:59.940 --> 28:02.530
- The most important thing
is to keep a cool head.

28:02.530 --> 28:03.680
Relax.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.035
Imagine the place is your own home.

28:06.035 --> 28:08.310
Feel the house or the bank.

28:08.310 --> 28:10.433
Just remember, if you think you know it,

28:10.433 --> 28:12.720
nothing can get the jump on you.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.450
- And if something does
get the jump on us?

28:14.450 --> 28:17.260
- Second most important
thing, learn to improvise.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.370
Don't crack under pressure.

28:18.370 --> 28:20.820
If you can't take the
heat, don't light the fuse.

28:21.870 --> 28:23.980
- That's not a phrase either.

28:23.980 --> 28:26.400
- Okay, quick fire question.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.920
We're in the house, and
the owners come back.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.902
They see two strangers in their home.

28:30.902 --> 28:32.162
What do you do?

28:32.162 --> 28:34.940
- Hi, I'm Moreau, the estate agent.

28:34.940 --> 28:36.480
Someone contacted us about selling?

28:36.480 --> 28:39.700
- [Richard] Oh, but we didn't
contact anyone about selling.

28:39.700 --> 28:40.533
- Someone did.

28:40.533 --> 28:41.800
They left a key in the office,

28:41.800 --> 28:42.633
so we came and stayed.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.290
And then we get the fuck out there

28:44.290 --> 28:45.780
before they ask any more questions.

28:45.780 --> 28:47.280
- Wow, I'm impressed.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.320
Okay, the neighbors see
us breaking into the house

28:49.320 --> 28:51.066
and calls the cops.

28:51.066 --> 28:53.073
- We're Italians. We own
the house and we're just

28:53.073 --> 28:55.810
shooting a little film about a break in.

28:55.810 --> 28:58.427
- Then why aren't you in
any of the family photos?

28:58.427 --> 28:59.570
- I'm the photographer.

28:59.570 --> 29:02.453
I'm behind the lens in all of these.

29:02.453 --> 29:03.615
- All right.

29:03.615 --> 29:05.520
Someone points a gun at us.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.103
- We get the fuck out of there.

29:10.105 --> 29:12.605
(light music)

29:19.223 --> 29:21.973
(cars whooshing)

29:24.167 --> 29:25.350
- You know, after all these years

29:25.350 --> 29:26.810
I still struggle to comprehend

29:26.810 --> 29:29.156
why you insist on sneaking up on me.

29:29.156 --> 29:30.210
You're still loud.

29:30.210 --> 29:31.911
- It's good seeing you too, Arthur.

29:31.911 --> 29:32.950
- I don't say the same.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.980
- I see you still carry an umbrella

29:34.980 --> 29:36.280
even though it's not raining.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.940
- Well you never know
when things might go south

29:37.940 --> 29:39.070
specially with you in the mix.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.270
- I need your help.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.480
- Your subtlety as always
is much appreciated.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.480
- I need to find a killer.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.130
- Well then I would suggest you go home

29:46.130 --> 29:48.520
and look at yourself in the mirror.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.353
- No.

29:49.353 --> 29:50.750
This guy does it because he wants to,

29:50.750 --> 29:51.830
not because he has to.

29:51.830 --> 29:55.261
And like it or not, you're involved.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.270
- Do enlighten me.

29:57.270 --> 29:59.057
- We were on a job to apprehend a subject

29:59.057 --> 30:01.540
when we went and found he was dead.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.373
- We?

30:02.373 --> 30:04.460
Oh god, don't tell me you're still working

30:04.460 --> 30:05.579
with James Wright.

30:05.579 --> 30:08.383
That poor bastard deserves so much more

30:08.383 --> 30:10.830
than working with an old
stick in the mud by the name,

30:10.830 --> 30:12.467
sorry, I forgot you were here.

30:12.467 --> 30:13.610
- May I continue?

30:13.610 --> 30:14.970
- Please.

30:14.970 --> 30:16.950
- [Cary] We found the
subject shot in the head.

30:16.950 --> 30:18.690
He bought a gun to protect himself.

30:18.690 --> 30:19.970
- [Arthur] Well that
didn't work, didn't it?

30:19.970 --> 30:21.540
- [Cary] Exactly.

30:21.540 --> 30:23.190
We think you or one of your associates

30:23.190 --> 30:24.390
supplied him with the firearm,

30:24.390 --> 30:26.540
and if you didn't then we were hoping

30:26.540 --> 30:28.090
you could help us find out who did.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.890
- [Arthur] Well, a name
would certainly help.

30:29.890 --> 30:30.723
- Gordon Bale.

30:30.723 --> 30:32.489
- Never heard that name before in my life.

30:32.489 --> 30:33.750
Or probably at some point

30:33.750 --> 30:35.750
but he mustn't have been very memorable.

30:37.720 --> 30:41.528
You know, a lot of these
types tend to use fake names

30:41.528 --> 30:43.890
for a multitude of reasons.

30:43.890 --> 30:45.720
A photo would be even more helpful.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.720
- [Cary] I came straight here.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.610
- So that's a no.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.870
- [Cary] James is at the
apartment, it's not far from here.

30:49.870 --> 30:52.880
- I'd love to join you
once you've lost your tail.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.950
Two men behind the flat there,

30:54.950 --> 30:58.327
been following us since
we got off the main road.

30:58.327 --> 31:00.930
One of them's wearing a hood,
probably carrying a gun.

31:00.930 --> 31:01.920
- [Cary] Faulkner.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.130
- Ah, I see.

31:03.130 --> 31:05.640
- See we were meant to bring
the subject in alive and

31:05.640 --> 31:07.050
things didn't go exactly to plan.

31:07.050 --> 31:09.880
- Ah, well, if your boy likes specificity,

31:09.880 --> 31:10.713
he should have hired me instead.

31:10.713 --> 31:12.630
I wouldn't be too
concerned about these two.

31:12.630 --> 31:15.090
Though I hope you know
where the street marks.

31:15.090 --> 31:17.000
I'd be much more worried
about who he sent over there

31:17.000 --> 31:17.923
to finish the job.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.313
All right.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.433
- That was the address.

31:22.550 --> 31:23.657
I'll meet you there in 30.

31:23.657 --> 31:25.323
- Good. Well, give
yourself some credit, mate.

31:25.323 --> 31:27.710
Yeah I could lose these guys in five.

31:27.710 --> 31:28.790
- 15 it is.

31:28.790 --> 31:30.713
- I'll see you there and then.

31:30.713 --> 31:31.750
Hey, Will!

31:31.750 --> 31:33.200
Will Holcroft, is that you?

31:33.200 --> 31:34.230
Oh my god.

31:34.230 --> 31:35.630
Here mate, have my umbrella.

31:38.650 --> 31:39.483
Maybe not.

31:40.898 --> 31:43.898
(suspenseful music)

32:04.907 --> 32:07.440
(gun firing)

32:07.440 --> 32:09.607
(bashing)

32:15.817 --> 32:17.984
(bashing)

32:22.253 --> 32:24.670
(gun firing)

32:40.058 --> 32:40.891
- Fuck.

32:47.671 --> 32:50.171
(tense music)

33:10.182 --> 33:11.175
- [Writer] The lights are on,

33:11.175 --> 33:12.057
they're still here!

33:12.057 --> 33:14.517
- [Richard] I've done my
research, they're not home.

33:14.517 --> 33:16.180
This is our house now.

33:16.180 --> 33:17.513
- [Writer] Okay.

33:31.181 --> 33:34.014
(stones rustling)

33:40.330 --> 33:42.002
- You're not ready for lockpicking.

33:42.002 --> 33:43.919
- I'll find my own way.

34:57.189 --> 34:59.439
(knocking)

35:00.376 --> 35:01.626
- Welcome home.

35:07.157 --> 35:09.407
- [Writer] I can't
believe we really made it.

35:10.660 --> 35:13.612
- Yeah, well, take anything you want.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.810
- [Writer] I thought we agreed

35:14.810 --> 35:17.130
we'd only take one thing each.

35:17.130 --> 35:18.630
- Well, go for it.

35:24.410 --> 35:27.577
(lightly tense music)

36:29.809 --> 36:32.726
(lighter clacking)

36:45.561 --> 36:48.061
(tense music)

36:50.204 --> 36:51.037
- Oy!

36:52.397 --> 36:53.230
Oy!

37:05.277 --> 37:06.110
He's back!

37:06.110 --> 37:07.672
Fucker's back!

37:07.672 --> 37:08.672
- Holy shit!

37:24.225 --> 37:26.725
(light music)

37:39.908 --> 37:42.158
(rustling)

38:40.042 --> 38:42.709
(pee trickling)

38:56.918 --> 38:59.751
(water splashing)

40:06.839 --> 40:09.339
(tense music)

41:04.676 --> 41:06.843
(bashing)

41:43.427 --> 41:45.317
(grunting)

41:45.317 --> 41:46.656
- James Wright.

41:46.656 --> 41:49.814
(knife clanking)

41:49.814 --> 41:52.388
(bashing)

41:52.388 --> 41:53.221
And you?

41:54.443 --> 41:56.558
I don't know who you are.
- Does it matter who I am?

41:56.558 --> 41:58.641
- Well, you're not wrong.

42:00.032 --> 42:02.199
(bashing)

42:11.570 --> 42:13.820
(clanging)

42:15.183 --> 42:16.348
Fucking hell.

42:16.348 --> 42:17.775
Cary, you motherfucker,

42:17.775 --> 42:19.400
you said you could do that in 15 minutes.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.259
- Yeah, well, there were two of them.

42:21.259 --> 42:22.757
Well now I've got another dead guy.

42:22.757 --> 42:24.272
- James.

42:24.272 --> 42:26.689
(gun firing)

42:29.011 --> 42:32.178
(light driving music)

43:56.893 --> 43:59.643
(music swelling)

44:31.516 --> 44:34.683
(light driving music)

45:23.641 --> 45:26.141
(light music)

45:46.477 --> 45:49.644
(lightly tense music)

45:53.792 --> 45:56.542
(wind whooshing)

45:57.670 --> 45:58.970
- How's the writing going?

46:01.680 --> 46:02.578
- Good.

46:02.578 --> 46:03.411
- Good.

46:03.411 --> 46:04.661
Cheers to that.

46:11.534 --> 46:13.506
So, what's it about?

46:13.506 --> 46:15.676
- For now, it's not out our crime.

46:15.676 --> 46:17.801
- [Richard] No, I mean the story.

46:17.801 --> 46:20.286
- You asked me what it's about, crime.

46:20.286 --> 46:21.551
- So what happens?

46:21.551 --> 46:23.756
- [Writer] You probably won't like it.

46:23.756 --> 46:24.810
- Will I not like it

46:24.810 --> 46:27.507
or is it because you haven't
decided what it it yet?

46:27.507 --> 46:29.770
- Whether you like it,
it's not the end of that.

46:29.770 --> 46:31.430
But be assured it wouldn't matter that.

46:31.430 --> 46:32.920
- [Richard] So what's it called?

46:32.920 --> 46:34.859
- Usually, I wait till the end

46:34.859 --> 46:36.563
like some reward for finishing.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.783
But this one, I knew from the start.

46:43.097 --> 46:45.580
"Voyage Into The Night."

46:45.580 --> 46:47.460
- That's quite a name, mate.

46:47.460 --> 46:48.973
Speaking of bold names,

46:50.440 --> 46:51.273
check this out.

46:52.948 --> 46:53.781
- [Writer] What's this?

46:53.781 --> 46:55.268
- [Richard] That, my friend,

46:55.268 --> 46:57.223
is the final chapter of our story.

47:02.860 --> 47:04.612
- What's so special about this one?

47:04.612 --> 47:06.620
- For starters, it's not a house.

47:06.620 --> 47:08.025
Well, kind of.

47:08.025 --> 47:09.024
It's a factory owned by one

47:09.024 --> 47:10.750
of the richest families in the world.

47:10.750 --> 47:12.470
They closed when the patriarch died.

47:12.470 --> 47:15.617
In this case, the apple
fell very far from the tree.

47:15.617 --> 47:17.030
All the children moved away

47:17.030 --> 47:19.320
and decided it wasn't worth a damn.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.750
They decided wrong.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.599
The father loved the factory
even more than his kids.

47:23.599 --> 47:25.923
So he built a house on the side of it.

47:28.530 --> 47:31.610
They say he left something
of great value in the house.

47:31.610 --> 47:34.060
Something he didn't even
tell his children about.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.840
It's a story I've heard for years.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.300
Only three people have ever gone in.

47:41.300 --> 47:43.490
Only one has ever come out alive.

47:43.490 --> 47:44.930
And he didn't find shit.

47:44.930 --> 47:46.873
- But you said the factory was abandoned.

47:47.910 --> 47:48.743
- Well, kind of.

47:48.743 --> 47:50.450
The family had the common decency

47:50.450 --> 47:52.760
to leave some guards on the outside.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.870
But the inside of the
factory is completely empty.

47:55.870 --> 47:58.100
It's built on the side of a cliff.

47:58.100 --> 47:59.500
Once you get past the guards,

47:59.500 --> 48:01.410
the house and the factory
should be completely empty.

48:01.410 --> 48:03.023
It should be smooth sailing.

48:04.979 --> 48:09.095
- If there is a hidden way,
that won't be a problem.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.218
Why do we go in

48:10.218 --> 48:12.203
if we don't know something of value?

48:12.203 --> 48:13.820
Specially now it's unseen.

48:13.820 --> 48:14.780
- We don't.

48:14.780 --> 48:16.840
Unless something in that
room is anything short

48:16.840 --> 48:20.117
of our heart's desire,
we take it or leave it.

48:20.117 --> 48:22.521
We're not in it for the money.

48:22.521 --> 48:25.530
- I think we've all heard that one before.

48:25.530 --> 48:26.580
- So what do you say?

48:34.591 --> 48:37.591
(light piano music)

48:43.800 --> 48:45.636
- This friend of yours considering,

48:45.636 --> 48:47.180
made us come out all this way

48:47.180 --> 48:48.474
for what again?

48:48.474 --> 48:49.990
- Precautions.

48:49.990 --> 48:51.370
We're not walking into that house

48:51.370 --> 48:53.540
with dark clothes and a blunt knife.

48:53.540 --> 48:56.070
If there's any time to
be prepared and precise,

48:56.070 --> 48:56.903
it is now.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.120
Arthur, it's been a while.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.619
- Richard, you absolute madman.

49:12.619 --> 49:13.858
When you first contacted me about this

49:13.858 --> 49:14.947
I knew you were crazy.

49:14.947 --> 49:17.115
But now, I think you're markedly insane.

49:17.115 --> 49:18.754
- Well, thanks for coming anyway.

49:18.754 --> 49:19.793
- Not a problem.

49:19.793 --> 49:20.626
You must be the writer

49:20.626 --> 49:22.169
that he told me absolutely nothing about.

49:22.169 --> 49:23.002
- My hands are dirty.

49:23.002 --> 49:24.370
- Of that I have no doubt.

49:24.370 --> 49:26.900
Something tells me that
won't be the last time.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.000
This should have everything you need.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.250
Gun, clothe, all the rest of it.

49:37.250 --> 49:39.540
I've also added the guards shift times

49:39.540 --> 49:42.450
along with the floor plan
to the factory itself,

49:42.450 --> 49:44.750
along with the maids' living quarters.

49:44.750 --> 49:48.350
Yes, the maids do still live
there, sentimental, I guess.

49:48.350 --> 49:49.300
That was all that was on record

49:49.300 --> 49:50.920
so you're gonna have to look for that

49:50.920 --> 49:53.126
oh so mysterious secret room yourself.

49:53.126 --> 49:55.202
But I'm sure you've discussed it already.

49:55.202 --> 49:56.360
That is mine.

49:56.360 --> 49:57.518
- Thank you, Arthur.

49:57.518 --> 49:59.252
We couldn't have done this without you.

49:59.252 --> 50:00.085
- I know.

50:01.350 --> 50:03.740
Richard, usually in
these types of situations

50:03.740 --> 50:04.573
I say see you.

50:04.573 --> 50:07.547
But in this case it looks
like it might be a goodbye.

50:07.547 --> 50:08.685
- See you around.

50:08.685 --> 50:09.810
- A word to the wise.

50:09.810 --> 50:11.428
Whatever it is you might find in there,

50:11.428 --> 50:12.851
just don't forget what you're looking for

50:12.851 --> 50:13.684
in the first place.

50:13.684 --> 50:15.152
He might have earned your trust,

50:15.152 --> 50:16.968
but just remember that his motivation

50:16.968 --> 50:19.218
is different than your own.

50:23.953 --> 50:26.703
(dramatic music)

50:34.975 --> 50:36.804
- It could be considered evidence, mate.

50:36.804 --> 50:38.137
- Maybe he died.

50:39.493 --> 50:41.667
- Yeah, I see that.

50:41.667 --> 50:44.273
- I'm really admiring
the professionalism here.

50:45.211 --> 50:46.830
The Faulkner guy is absolutely terrible

50:46.830 --> 50:48.170
at hiring you two incompetents.

50:48.170 --> 50:50.550
I mean, how does it feel
to have technically been

50:50.550 --> 50:52.530
colleagues with that dipshit over there,

50:52.530 --> 50:53.700
it's just degrading.

50:53.700 --> 50:55.035
- [Cary] Not what you're here to do.

50:55.035 --> 50:56.618
- [Arthur] Ah, yes.

51:03.807 --> 51:05.260
- Recognize him?

51:05.260 --> 51:06.500
- Yes, I do.

51:06.500 --> 51:08.230
He called himself Bill Smith though,

51:08.230 --> 51:09.480
not Gordon whatever.

51:09.480 --> 51:10.330
- Bill Smith is a

51:11.180 --> 51:12.590
rather generic name.

51:12.590 --> 51:13.529
- Yes it is.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.100
- More like John Doe.

51:15.100 --> 51:17.150
- I called him out for it
the last time I saw him

51:17.150 --> 51:18.689
and you know, he seemed to say

51:18.689 --> 51:21.140
it's my first time, it
was this, it was that.

51:21.140 --> 51:23.490
And usually with these types
it is their first time.

51:23.490 --> 51:24.323
Or it's not.

51:24.323 --> 51:25.671
But with him I could tell

51:25.671 --> 51:26.810
that it probably was his first time.

51:26.810 --> 51:28.560
Shame really, seemed like a nice guy.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.993
- He didn't deserve to die.

51:30.900 --> 51:33.053
- [Arthur] Yes well, neither
did our friend in the bathroom.

51:33.053 --> 51:34.910
Well actually, he tried to kill us

51:34.910 --> 51:36.310
so that's not strictly true.

51:39.170 --> 51:41.560
- I reckon that's 5-7 by two two.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.380
You don't know anyone
around here who sells those?

51:43.380 --> 51:44.890
- My dear friend, around these parts,

51:44.890 --> 51:46.719
I'm the only person who sells those.

51:46.719 --> 51:48.281
- Well that narrows down the list

51:48.281 --> 51:50.320
of potential suspects.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.530
- No.

51:51.530 --> 51:52.560
It's not a common gun

51:52.560 --> 51:54.410
but I imagine you've sold a fair few.

51:56.020 --> 51:58.670
I however, did find a letter.

51:58.670 --> 51:59.933
- Let's have a look.

52:00.860 --> 52:01.720
"Dear Gordon,

52:01.720 --> 52:03.410
hope all is well.

52:03.410 --> 52:05.900
Things haven't gone exactly
as expected at my end.

52:05.900 --> 52:07.680
And in an attempt to get out of the hole

52:07.680 --> 52:10.010
I've only dug myself deeper into it.

52:10.010 --> 52:12.200
By now, people will be coming for me.

52:12.200 --> 52:14.540
Unfortunately that puts you in danger too.

52:14.540 --> 52:16.860
I know that you've had nothing
to do with my situation

52:16.860 --> 52:19.110
but I would prefer it if you found a way

52:19.110 --> 52:20.700
to protect yourself.

52:20.700 --> 52:23.350
Go see a man at this address,
he will sort you out.

52:23.350 --> 52:24.250
Don't use your real name.

52:24.250 --> 52:25.490
Make sure that there is no way

52:25.490 --> 52:27.120
that he can trace you back to him.

52:27.120 --> 52:30.120
I don't know when of
if I will see you again

52:30.120 --> 52:34.890
but know that I am so sorry
things ended up like this.

52:34.890 --> 52:35.900
Dickie."

52:35.900 --> 52:37.550
- So he wasn't reading through a script

52:37.550 --> 52:38.383
when you were stalking him.

52:38.383 --> 52:39.800
He was reading through this.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.150
- We need to find this guy.

52:43.340 --> 52:46.000
- Address says 52 Riverside Porter.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.660
- 52 it is then.

52:47.660 --> 52:49.793
Arthur, one final favor.

52:50.794 --> 52:52.100
- [Arthur] Kachoo!

52:52.100 --> 52:54.000
- Check all the people who bought that

52:55.240 --> 52:58.200
5-6 whatchamacallit last week

52:58.200 --> 52:59.673
and let us know if any of them seemed

52:59.673 --> 53:01.980
under serious threat.

53:01.980 --> 53:03.312
- Cary.

53:03.312 --> 53:04.612
They bought a gun,

53:04.612 --> 53:06.445
I'm pretty sure they were
under serious threat,

53:06.445 --> 53:08.166
but yes, I will
(thunder rumbling)

53:08.166 --> 53:09.966
let you know if anything happens,

53:09.966 --> 53:11.883
if I find anything out.

53:16.524 --> 53:19.524
(suspenseful music)

54:38.440 --> 54:39.273
- Two minutes.

54:39.273 --> 54:41.053
Two minutes and then the guard are back

54:41.053 --> 54:42.886
and then we're fucked.

54:44.398 --> 54:47.148
(doors slamming)

54:51.612 --> 54:54.112
(tense music)

55:01.743 --> 55:04.319
(gun clacking)

55:04.319 --> 55:05.323
- Shit.

55:05.323 --> 55:06.981
Shit, I left my gun.

55:06.981 --> 55:08.481
- There's no time.

55:11.062 --> 55:13.562
(dog barking)

55:24.549 --> 55:27.549
(crickets chirping)

55:33.463 --> 55:36.130
(gate clanking)

55:53.232 --> 55:56.399
(lightly tense music)

56:49.200 --> 56:50.338
Go upstairs.

56:50.338 --> 56:51.579
I'll go up the main factory.

56:51.579 --> 56:53.602
- Wait, that wasn't the plan.

56:53.602 --> 56:55.623
- We're not leaving
until I find that room.

56:56.458 --> 56:58.108
- What if they're upstairs?

56:58.108 --> 56:59.030
What happened to caution, precaution?

56:59.030 --> 57:00.260
- Caution and precision.

57:00.260 --> 57:02.240
I'm not leaving until I find that room.

57:02.240 --> 57:03.073
- [Writer] Let's go upstairs,

57:03.073 --> 57:04.060
grab something we find interesting

57:04.060 --> 57:04.893
and let's get out.

57:04.893 --> 57:06.873
- Get your ass upstairs.

57:10.463 --> 57:13.880
(melancholy piano music)

58:04.202 --> 58:06.702
(tense music)

58:47.162 --> 58:49.745
(somber music)

59:04.777 --> 59:07.860
(tense violin music)

1:00:34.832 --> 1:00:38.165
(dramatic string music)

1:00:59.566 --> 1:01:02.649
(tense violin music)

1:01:12.636 --> 1:01:15.165
- I am taking this box.

1:01:15.165 --> 1:01:17.539
- You can't take it.

1:01:17.539 --> 1:01:18.560
- What the fuck?

1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:19.870
When we started this,

1:01:19.870 --> 1:01:22.030
we agreed that we can take one object

1:01:22.030 --> 1:01:23.460
in every house we went to.

1:01:23.460 --> 1:01:25.200
This is my object.

1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:26.630
I intend on staying alive.

1:01:26.630 --> 1:01:28.570
If we take this, we'll have
everyone who wants to kill

1:01:28.570 --> 1:01:29.550
out for us.

1:01:29.550 --> 1:01:30.790
I intend on staying alive!

1:01:30.790 --> 1:01:32.470
- I didn't even wanna do this!

1:01:32.470 --> 1:01:33.940
I moved out here to start a new life,

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:35.980
to build my fucking fortress!

1:01:35.980 --> 1:01:37.410
- Fuck off, this was your idea!

1:01:37.410 --> 1:01:39.350
One last heist, one great haul,

1:01:39.350 --> 1:01:40.365
one big object!

1:01:40.365 --> 1:01:42.180
- I only started this
'cause I ran into you!

1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:43.650
- Fuck off, you dragged me into this!

1:01:43.650 --> 1:01:46.660
- Oh, please, you pretentious prick.

1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:48.760
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be stuck

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.240
in that glorified office of yours

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:55.885
fucking contemplating about
your empty fucking creativeness!

1:01:55.885 --> 1:01:57.070
I need this.

1:01:57.070 --> 1:01:57.903
- You need nothing!

1:01:57.903 --> 1:01:59.480
You've got purpose, you've got excitement,

1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:00.350
you've got everything I could need.

1:02:00.350 --> 1:02:01.750
I'd have a hundred men satisfied but you.

1:02:01.750 --> 1:02:04.410
You don't need the box, no one does.

1:02:04.410 --> 1:02:06.500
- Look at this face. Do
you think this is the face

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:09.360
that gives two fucks
about your permission?

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:10.193
- Do not.

1:02:12.648 --> 1:02:14.934
- Don't.
(creaking)

1:02:14.934 --> 1:02:17.101
(bashing)

1:02:26.682 --> 1:02:28.932
(thudding)

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:41.010
- What bloody time do you call this?

1:02:41.010 --> 1:02:42.380
- I do apologize, sir.

1:02:42.380 --> 1:02:43.440
Our matter is rather urgent.

1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:45.220
- Do you anyone by the name Dickie?

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:46.053
- Dickie?

1:02:47.220 --> 1:02:48.323
Ah, you mean Richard?

1:02:49.310 --> 1:02:51.820
Yeah, he was the previous owner here.

1:02:51.820 --> 1:02:53.330
- [Cary] Someone very
close to him has died

1:02:53.330 --> 1:02:54.917
and we'd like you to inform them.

1:02:54.917 --> 1:02:56.663
- But he moved away months ago.

1:02:56.663 --> 1:02:57.570
- [James] Do you know where he is now?

1:02:57.570 --> 1:02:58.710
- No.

1:02:58.710 --> 1:03:00.610
But I do know where you two will be

1:03:00.610 --> 1:03:02.890
if you don't fuck off
from my property now.

1:03:02.890 --> 1:03:04.793
- [James] Sorry to have woken you.

1:03:14.412 --> 1:03:16.974
So, we breaking into there?

1:03:16.974 --> 1:03:17.807
- Yup.

1:03:20.074 --> 1:03:22.574
(tense music)

1:04:34.736 --> 1:04:38.293
You know, as far as
first detectives jobs go,

1:04:39.150 --> 1:04:40.620
that wasn't the worst.

1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:42.070
- We were both nearly killed.

1:04:43.650 --> 1:04:46.280
Aside from that, I say we've had worse.

1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:47.905
- You remember that time three years ago

1:04:47.905 --> 1:04:50.455
where I had to drag you
from that burning building?

1:04:51.290 --> 1:04:52.123
- One of many.

1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:56.120
- To somehow still being alive.

1:04:56.120 --> 1:04:59.153
- Cheers.
(glasses clinking)

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:05.370
So what are we thinking
for the break-in tomorrow?

1:05:05.370 --> 1:05:07.427
We can wait for the wanker to go to work

1:05:07.427 --> 1:05:09.560
and then I can either pick the lock

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.000
or we can break the
windows and go in that way.

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.923
- You know, I say we go for
the subtle approach this time.

1:05:17.770 --> 1:05:19.770
I've had enough of the
unnecessary attention,

1:05:19.770 --> 1:05:20.707
to be honest.

1:05:33.652 --> 1:05:36.152
(light music)

1:06:03.898 --> 1:06:06.398
(tense music)

1:06:15.353 --> 1:06:17.520
(sighing)

1:06:23.590 --> 1:06:26.170
- [Arthur] This better be seriously good.

1:06:26.170 --> 1:06:27.003
- Arthur?

1:06:27.003 --> 1:06:28.957
- Oh, I guess it was.

1:06:28.957 --> 1:06:30.950
You did it, well done.

1:06:30.950 --> 1:06:31.783
Where's Richard?

1:06:31.783 --> 1:06:32.850
He must be very happy with himself.

1:06:32.850 --> 1:06:34.500
Now put him on the phone.

1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.274
- Yeah, he shot off this morning.

1:06:36.274 --> 1:06:38.332
He left me a message saying
he got some stuff to do.

1:06:38.332 --> 1:06:39.760
Don't you know where he is?

1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:40.850
- Oh.

1:06:40.850 --> 1:06:42.380
Well that's not much of a surprise.

1:06:42.380 --> 1:06:44.350
It's not the first time this has happened.

1:06:44.350 --> 1:06:47.771
If I were you, I would probably
check his house in the city.

1:06:47.771 --> 1:06:49.648
I can send you the address if you'd like.

1:06:49.648 --> 1:06:50.970
And how was the car by the way?

1:06:50.970 --> 1:06:52.068
Work well and everything?

1:06:52.068 --> 1:06:52.926
- It worked just fine.

1:06:52.926 --> 1:06:53.759
Bye.

1:07:12.859 --> 1:07:15.802
(phone buzzing)

1:07:15.802 --> 1:07:16.635
- Cary.

1:07:18.580 --> 1:07:19.413
- What?

1:07:29.301 --> 1:07:30.300
- Arthur.

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:31.140
Arthur?

1:07:31.140 --> 1:07:32.097
- [Arthur] Is James with you?

1:07:32.097 --> 1:07:33.182
- Yeah, mate, I'm here.

1:07:33.182 --> 1:07:34.720
- [Arthur] All right, good.

1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:36.920
I think I may have found
who you need to look for.

1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:38.220
- What, Dickie?

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:39.090
We found his house.

1:07:39.090 --> 1:07:40.422
He's moved out months ago.

1:07:40.422 --> 1:07:41.660
- I think you mean Richard.

1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:44.460
No one calls him Dickie
except your murder victim.

1:07:44.460 --> 1:07:45.293
They must have been close

1:07:45.293 --> 1:07:46.879
because Richard had
never been called that.

1:07:46.879 --> 1:07:49.500
He never even told me his last name.

1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:50.593
- Well where is he?

1:07:52.017 --> 1:07:54.267
- [Arthur] Richard is dead.

1:07:58.467 --> 1:08:00.090
One of my guys told me

1:08:00.090 --> 1:08:01.197
he was found dead in his house,

1:08:01.197 --> 1:08:03.900
killed by the same bullet that got Gordon.

1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:05.870
Now I have no idea what's going on

1:08:05.870 --> 1:08:08.544
and the only person who
might is his partner.

1:08:08.544 --> 1:08:09.837
You need to find him,
you need to find him.

1:08:09.837 --> 1:08:11.898
I don't know his name or his address,

1:08:11.898 --> 1:08:12.892
he uses a burner phone.

1:08:12.892 --> 1:08:15.760
Very old fashioned like you, Cary.

1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:18.830
What I do have is a license
plate, the license plate

1:08:18.830 --> 1:08:20.290
of the car I gave him.

1:08:20.290 --> 1:08:21.844
I'll text it to you now.

1:08:21.844 --> 1:08:24.495
- We find the car, we find him.

1:08:24.495 --> 1:08:27.417
- When you find him, be careful.

1:08:27.417 --> 1:08:30.374
He's a lot more ruthless than he lets on.

1:08:30.374 --> 1:08:31.457
- Understood.

1:08:41.628 --> 1:08:44.128
(tense music)

1:09:55.860 --> 1:09:58.610
(dramatic music)

1:10:41.414 --> 1:10:46.414
(somber piano music)
(water splashing)

1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:24.137
(door knocking)

1:11:24.137 --> 1:11:26.172
- [Gordon] Ah, Dickie,
you arrived, and early!

1:11:26.172 --> 1:11:27.005
What's going on?

1:11:27.005 --> 1:11:28.422
- Hello, brother.

1:11:35.510 --> 1:11:38.177
(caps clinking)

1:11:44.569 --> 1:11:45.402
This for me?

1:11:45.402 --> 1:11:46.713
- No, they're both mine.

1:11:47.550 --> 1:11:48.383
- Thanks.

1:11:52.370 --> 1:11:54.540
Jesus, Gordy, this tastes like shit.

1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:56.950
- I'm surprised you haven't
drunk any more, then.

1:11:56.950 --> 1:11:58.100
- [Richard] Can you
bring me anything else?

1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:00.400
- The cure for low key
alcoholism and kleptomania.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.370
- Ooh, you gonna write
that in your new book?

1:12:02.370 --> 1:12:03.360
- It's not like you're gonna read it.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:04.193
- True.

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:08.100
- So, what brings you this close to home?

1:12:08.100 --> 1:12:09.270
All the banks robbed dry?

1:12:09.270 --> 1:12:11.980
- No, I actually came to see you.

1:12:11.980 --> 1:12:13.620
I'm taking your advice and I'm out.

1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:15.663
It feels fucking good.

1:12:17.708 --> 1:12:19.480
- [Gordon] Out of what?

1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:20.313
- [Richard] Everything.

1:12:20.313 --> 1:12:22.433
Everything, I'm done, I'm out, I quit.

1:12:22.433 --> 1:12:23.663
- What is going on?

1:12:23.663 --> 1:12:26.017
- [Richard] I know, right, unbelievable.

1:12:26.017 --> 1:12:28.684
- Probably 'cause it's not true.

1:12:32.405 --> 1:12:35.310
- I had a brush with death recently

1:12:35.310 --> 1:12:37.670
and it put a lot of things in perspective.

1:12:37.670 --> 1:12:40.350
And I've got enough money
now to get out clean

1:12:40.350 --> 1:12:41.500
and live well.

1:12:42.748 --> 1:12:43.949
- What happened?

1:12:43.949 --> 1:12:46.151
- Well, if you must know, Gordy,

1:12:46.151 --> 1:12:49.610
actually, let me dramatize
it for you, shall I?

1:12:49.610 --> 1:12:51.840
I was in a job with three blokes

1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:54.490
with great honor and integrity.

1:12:54.490 --> 1:12:57.090
And then they decided
to fuck me up the ass.

1:12:57.090 --> 1:12:59.320
The first guy stabbed me
in the back with a knife.

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:00.947
The second twisted it,

1:13:00.947 --> 1:13:03.940
and the third ran off
with my hard-earned cash

1:13:03.940 --> 1:13:05.610
as I chased him still with the knife

1:13:05.610 --> 1:13:07.300
firmly lodged in my behind.

1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:08.740
- So what actually happened

1:13:08.740 --> 1:13:10.260
is you went and betrayed them.

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:11.940
And they caught on.

1:13:11.940 --> 1:13:13.700
- Yeah, precisely.

1:13:13.700 --> 1:13:14.533
- Jesus.

1:13:14.533 --> 1:13:16.790
One of these days you're
actually gonna get killed.

1:13:16.790 --> 1:13:17.990
You better stay retired.

1:13:18.877 --> 1:13:21.320
Although we both know
that ain't gonna happen.

1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:23.370
- Wait till you see this
one, mate, it's insane.

1:13:23.370 --> 1:13:24.940
Quiet neighborhood, no one
there for me to bother.

1:13:24.940 --> 1:13:27.300
- [Gordon] You mean no one to bother you.

1:13:27.300 --> 1:13:29.290
- Sure, but I gotta tell you bro,

1:13:29.290 --> 1:13:30.610
this might just be it.

1:13:33.490 --> 1:13:34.670
- Let's make a deal then.

1:13:34.670 --> 1:13:35.714
If you don't succumb to thievery

1:13:35.714 --> 1:13:37.028
by our next family gathering,

1:13:37.028 --> 1:13:38.471
I'll give you something better to drink.

1:13:38.471 --> 1:13:39.402
- Deal.

1:13:39.402 --> 1:13:42.319
(bottles clinking)

1:13:56.830 --> 1:13:59.280
- Good evening, Mr. Bale,
this is Detective Koby.

1:14:00.890 --> 1:14:02.470
I regret to inform you that your brother

1:14:02.470 --> 1:14:04.737
was found dead this evening.

1:14:04.737 --> 1:14:05.633
He was shot.

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.150
He was under suspicions

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.550
and it is unfortunate that
trouble found him first.

1:14:12.866 --> 1:14:14.699
I'm sorry to say this.

1:14:23.730 --> 1:14:25.696
- Fuck out of my way, bitch.

1:14:25.696 --> 1:14:26.529
Get off!

1:14:26.529 --> 1:14:28.196
Get the fuck off me!

1:14:34.164 --> 1:14:37.497
(dramatic somber music)

1:14:39.117 --> 1:14:40.200
Oh, fuck, ah!

1:15:05.076 --> 1:15:06.525
(somber piano music)

1:15:06.525 --> 1:15:08.775
(groaning)

1:15:28.666 --> 1:15:29.640
Hello?

1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:31.470
Yeah, is this Cary Lang?

1:15:31.470 --> 1:15:32.723
Yeah, right, it's Faulkner.

1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:35.060
Shut up and listen.

1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:36.320
Something's happened.

1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:37.560
I don't know his name.

1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:40.320
He's my height, brown haired, slim built.

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:43.044
Listen, I want this fucker alive.

1:15:43.044 --> 1:15:44.780
I don't care if he's in pieces.

1:15:44.780 --> 1:15:45.910
You get me him alive

1:15:45.910 --> 1:15:47.523
or it's you who's six feet under, okay?

1:15:53.544 --> 1:15:56.627
(somber piano music)

1:16:05.743 --> 1:16:08.790
- [Richard Voiceover] Dear
Gordon, I hope all is well.

1:16:08.790 --> 1:16:11.323
Things haven't exactly
gone as expected at my end.

1:16:12.290 --> 1:16:14.190
In an attempt to get out of the hole,

1:16:14.190 --> 1:16:16.043
I've only dug myself deeper into it.

1:16:16.930 --> 1:16:19.540
By now, people will be coming for me

1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:22.040
and that unfortunately
puts you in danger as well.

1:16:23.010 --> 1:16:26.360
I know you have had nothing
to do with my situation.

1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.750
But I would feel easier if you found a way

1:16:28.750 --> 1:16:30.170
to protect yourself.

1:16:30.170 --> 1:16:32.490
Go see this man at this address.

1:16:32.490 --> 1:16:34.030
He will sort you out.

1:16:34.030 --> 1:16:35.270
Don't use your real name

1:16:35.270 --> 1:16:38.020
and make sure there is no
way they can link you to him.

1:16:38.970 --> 1:16:42.830
I don't know when or if
I will see you again.

1:16:42.830 --> 1:16:45.880
But know that I am so sorry

1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:47.707
things ended up like this.

1:18:11.173 --> 1:18:13.840
(door knocking)

1:18:22.039 --> 1:18:23.705
(door creaking)
- [Gordon] Can I help you?

1:18:23.705 --> 1:18:24.538
- [Man] Hi, mate.

1:18:24.538 --> 1:18:27.420
I think your pizza got dropped
off at mine by mistake.

1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:28.540
- [Gordon] Didn't order any pizza.

1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:29.596
- [Man] It says it's for Gordon.

1:18:29.596 --> 1:18:30.429
That's you, right?

1:18:30.429 --> 1:18:33.262
- [Gordon] Yeah, give me a second.

1:18:36.478 --> 1:18:38.324
Can I see this?

1:18:38.324 --> 1:18:39.398
(gun firing)

1:18:39.398 --> 1:18:42.731
(dramatic somber music)

1:19:56.548 --> 1:19:59.048
(light music)

1:22:10.030 --> 1:22:12.150
- Listen now, you scumbag.

1:22:12.150 --> 1:22:15.170
Do us all a favor and fuck off.

1:22:15.170 --> 1:22:16.800
I got enough on my plate as it is.

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:20.633
And your attitude's really
starting to get under my skin.

1:22:21.970 --> 1:22:23.893
No, I'm not doing business with you!

1:22:28.380 --> 1:22:29.213
Let me be

1:22:30.410 --> 1:22:32.530
or I will rip your fucking head off,

1:22:32.530 --> 1:22:33.533
you know I will!

1:22:36.357 --> 1:22:37.190
- Ooh.

1:22:37.190 --> 1:22:38.500
- Jesus.

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:39.846
- He is big though.

1:22:39.846 --> 1:22:41.850
That's why there's two of us.

1:22:41.850 --> 1:22:43.758
- Not as big as your ego though.

1:22:43.758 --> 1:22:44.591
- Hah.

1:22:45.581 --> 1:22:46.441
All right, let's go.

1:22:46.441 --> 1:22:47.768
- Bro, what the fuck are you doing?

1:22:47.768 --> 1:22:50.660
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- No, no, not like this.

1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:52.000
- What you mean?

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.560
- Well how about for one night we dispense

1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:57.530
of the unnecessary violence
and try something else?

1:22:57.530 --> 1:22:59.430
How many pairs of glasses have you lost?

1:22:59.430 --> 1:23:00.483
I mean, broken.

1:23:01.430 --> 1:23:02.263
- Fine.

1:23:02.263 --> 1:23:03.593
- Hell, what the, what are you doing?

1:23:04.582 --> 1:23:06.240
- Well this is necessary violence!

1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:07.307
- No, no, no, no.

1:23:08.490 --> 1:23:09.943
I'll go talk to him.

1:23:11.810 --> 1:23:13.023
Right, coax him over?

1:23:14.430 --> 1:23:17.850
- Oh fine, you go talk to him
with your newfound charisma.

1:23:17.850 --> 1:23:20.390
- Yeah, right, I fucking will, watch me.

1:23:20.390 --> 1:23:23.386
- [Cary] And if your idea
doesn't work, it's mine.

1:23:23.386 --> 1:23:24.469
- Mr. Jensen.

1:23:26.078 --> 1:23:29.817
- How the fuck do you know my name?

1:23:29.817 --> 1:23:32.755
- We've been looking for
you for some time now.

1:23:32.755 --> 1:23:35.640
- And who the fuck are you?

1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:38.223
- I'm Jack and this is Ben.

1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:40.570
Germaine.
- Ben.

1:23:40.570 --> 1:23:42.000
Germaine.

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.250
- And what do you two fucking want?

1:23:44.250 --> 1:23:46.670
- We'd like to talk to you about a recent

1:23:46.670 --> 1:23:47.990
acquisition you made.

1:23:47.990 --> 1:23:50.253
A vehicle with this registration.

1:23:52.470 --> 1:23:54.280
- Yeah, I've got it.

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:57.920
Some bloke sold it to me too
for an absolute piece of shit.

1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:00.410
Only a fucking retard
would turn that down.

1:24:00.410 --> 1:24:01.923
- So you turned it down then?

1:24:02.850 --> 1:24:06.200
- [James] Hey, mate, just
tell us what he looks like.

1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:08.772
- You're asking an awful lot of questions.

1:24:08.772 --> 1:24:10.086
You're not cops, are you?

1:24:10.086 --> 1:24:11.169
- [James] No.

1:24:12.530 --> 1:24:13.933
- You sound like a cop.

1:24:16.890 --> 1:24:18.237
- [James] We're just looking for answers.

1:24:18.237 --> 1:24:19.589
- And how's that going for you?

1:24:19.589 --> 1:24:21.100
- Just fucking answer his
questions, all right?!

1:24:21.100 --> 1:24:23.030
- Don't you two surround me.

1:24:23.030 --> 1:24:26.135
- Now you're lack of compliance
is making me uncomfortable.

1:24:26.135 --> 1:24:27.218
- Compliance.

1:24:28.219 --> 1:24:29.886
What's in it for me?

1:24:32.890 --> 1:24:33.723
- Hey.

1:24:34.610 --> 1:24:36.330
We did it your way.

1:24:36.330 --> 1:24:37.163
It's my turn now.

1:24:37.163 --> 1:24:39.290
Tell us about our fucking
car and our fucking man

1:24:39.290 --> 1:24:41.393
and the fucking place he went to.

1:24:41.393 --> 1:24:42.226
- Or what?

1:24:42.226 --> 1:24:43.953
- Or you're not gonna like the answer.

1:24:45.292 --> 1:24:47.083
- And what if I don't feel like it?

1:24:47.083 --> 1:24:47.916
(gun clacking)

1:24:47.916 --> 1:24:48.749
- You'll feel like it.

1:24:48.749 --> 1:24:50.860
Do not compete with me

1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:52.383
'cause you will lose.

1:24:52.383 --> 1:24:54.420
- So let's remember what you're asking me

1:24:54.420 --> 1:24:57.510
with a gun pressed up against my bollocks?

1:24:57.510 --> 1:25:00.016
- Just tell us the car model

1:25:00.016 --> 1:25:03.030
and what he's gonna do with it.

1:25:03.030 --> 1:25:04.580
- The vehicle license plate

1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:06.563
is in my left hand pocket of my jacket.

1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:11.940
- [James] Jesus, mate, what
were you gonna pull out first,

1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:13.090
the knife or the phone?

1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:14.820
- Neither.

1:25:14.820 --> 1:25:17.070
(bashing)

1:25:17.070 --> 1:25:18.020
All right, all right, all right.

1:25:18.020 --> 1:25:19.563
Just give me the damn phone!

1:25:25.980 --> 1:25:26.813
This is the car.

1:25:26.813 --> 1:25:28.420
He went up north.

1:25:28.420 --> 1:25:30.670
Somewhere no one could bother him!

1:25:32.839 --> 1:25:36.140
- Thank you very much for
your assistance, Mr. Jensen.

1:25:38.850 --> 1:25:40.620
- You're lucky I didn't
learn your real names.

1:25:40.620 --> 1:25:42.962
- Nope, we're just clever.

1:25:42.962 --> 1:25:47.770
- Oh, and you better forget
about this conversation.

1:25:47.770 --> 1:25:48.863
Because we won't.

1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:52.723
- So, Cary.

1:25:54.583 --> 1:25:56.180
Or should I say Jack?

1:25:56.180 --> 1:25:57.980
When are we going after this writer?

1:25:59.350 --> 1:26:00.940
- We'll sort out our affairs down here

1:26:00.940 --> 1:26:03.453
and then cover up our tracks and head up.

1:26:05.396 --> 1:26:08.063
- That should take a day or so.

1:26:08.980 --> 1:26:11.590
So we'll leave first thing after tomorrow.

1:26:11.590 --> 1:26:12.423
- Done.

1:26:22.672 --> 1:26:26.422
(lightly somber piano music)

1:26:31.525 --> 1:26:32.598
- [Man] Need a light, man?

1:26:32.598 --> 1:26:33.431
- Cheers.

1:26:33.431 --> 1:26:34.514
- No problem.

1:26:42.676 --> 1:26:45.260
- Well it is a bit of a
problem. I'm trying to quit.

1:26:45.260 --> 1:26:46.270
- Yeah but every now and then

1:26:46.270 --> 1:26:47.970
it's nice to break your own rules.

1:26:49.260 --> 1:26:52.730
- Thanks for feeding my
self-destructive tendencies.

1:26:52.730 --> 1:26:55.103
- Life's too short to not treat yourself.

1:26:55.103 --> 1:26:56.550
- I'm Cary, by the way.

1:26:56.550 --> 1:26:58.860
- Yeah, Cary, Cary Lang.

1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:01.227
I'm the writer you're looking for.

1:27:01.227 --> 1:27:03.350
- Now, now, let's take it easy.

1:27:03.350 --> 1:27:06.120
I know you can't kill me
and you won't kill me.

1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:07.160
- [Cary] How's that?

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:08.930
- The can't or the won't?

1:27:08.930 --> 1:27:10.200
Actually, I've indulged you.

1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.090
Indulge me, we've got time for both.

1:27:12.090 --> 1:27:14.620
You can't kill me 'cause
you don't have a gun.

1:27:14.620 --> 1:27:16.750
If you did, it'd be pulled
out at the head right now

1:27:16.750 --> 1:27:18.890
or some giant bulge in your jacket.

1:27:18.890 --> 1:27:20.630
But you won't kill me and
that's more interesting

1:27:20.630 --> 1:27:22.433
because you're like me.

1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:24.810
You won't go beating up on some

1:27:24.810 --> 1:27:27.310
smart, attractive, funny,
helpless man on the street,

1:27:27.310 --> 1:27:28.290
even though you could.

1:27:28.290 --> 1:27:30.170
Because you want that
squeeze of the trigger

1:27:30.170 --> 1:27:31.810
to still mean something.

1:27:31.810 --> 1:27:33.730
You don't want action without consequence.

1:27:33.730 --> 1:27:35.540
You're still aware of what you do.

1:27:35.540 --> 1:27:37.250
You don't want to do this, but you do it.

1:27:37.250 --> 1:27:39.590
And you want something more.

1:27:39.590 --> 1:27:41.400
And you've always wanted
that something more.

1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:42.770
You've been trying to
crawl your way out of it

1:27:42.770 --> 1:27:43.760
since day one.

1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:46.200
You'd much rather do what you
love and love what you do.

1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:47.680
And I might just be able to give you that.

1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:49.320
I've just told your life story.

1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:50.180
I could tell by the look in your face

1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:53.156
you have quite a few questions to ask me.

1:27:53.156 --> 1:27:54.093
- More than a few.

1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:56.860
- Well, I won't answer all of them.

1:27:56.860 --> 1:27:59.180
I'm sure we'll have more fun that way.

1:27:59.180 --> 1:28:01.330
But the first one would probably be

1:28:01.330 --> 1:28:02.780
how did I find you?

1:28:02.780 --> 1:28:05.860
And why did I say all of that?

1:28:05.860 --> 1:28:07.253
- Yeah, sure.

1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:09.213
Go ahead.

1:28:09.213 --> 1:28:10.770
- Well, I had to call Richard.

1:28:10.770 --> 1:28:13.460
And after that I killed
his brother Gordon.

1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:15.390
Loose ends, et cetera.

1:28:15.390 --> 1:28:18.670
But you can't kill two
men and get away with it.

1:28:18.670 --> 1:28:19.970
I'm not stupid, I'm still sane.

1:28:19.970 --> 1:28:21.560
Someone was gonna come after me.

1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:22.820
Someone was gonna find me.

1:28:22.820 --> 1:28:25.270
And I just wanted to know
how sharp their teeth were.

1:28:25.270 --> 1:28:26.653
- Are you satisfied?

1:28:27.930 --> 1:28:28.763
- Very.

1:28:28.763 --> 1:28:30.150
You see, us writers,

1:28:30.150 --> 1:28:32.090
or at least the ones of us who care,

1:28:32.090 --> 1:28:33.350
we do our research.

1:28:33.350 --> 1:28:36.640
We try to know everything
we can about our stories.

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:38.810
I've talked to a number
of people from your world

1:28:38.810 --> 1:28:41.650
who hold you and your
partner in high regards.

1:28:41.650 --> 1:28:43.700
After all, you've sent
many of their enemies

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:44.650
into the ground.

1:28:44.650 --> 1:28:46.470
And I wanted to meet you in person,

1:28:46.470 --> 1:28:48.070
to see for certain if you are

1:28:48.070 --> 1:28:49.743
truly who they say you are.

1:28:50.778 --> 1:28:52.150
- You did just get the sneak on me though.

1:28:52.150 --> 1:28:53.493
- We're not perfect, Cary.

1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.410
- [Cary] No, we're not.

1:28:57.410 --> 1:28:58.400
No, we are not.

1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:01.860
And it wouldn't be nearly
as interesting if we were.

1:29:01.860 --> 1:29:04.210
- So you regret killing those people then?

1:29:04.210 --> 1:29:05.450
- The killing?

1:29:05.450 --> 1:29:07.630
Yes, but it was necessary.

1:29:07.630 --> 1:29:09.280
I've done more than a
few things in my life

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:10.113
I wish I didn't do.

1:29:10.113 --> 1:29:12.400
There's nothing wrong with
admitting my mistakes.

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:15.530
But what matters is whether
or not I learned from it.

1:29:15.530 --> 1:29:16.363
- [Cary] Have you?

1:29:16.363 --> 1:29:17.603
- I'm here now.

1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:20.850
- So what do you want then?

1:29:20.850 --> 1:29:23.480
To continue as if nothing happened?

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:24.793
No.

1:29:24.793 --> 1:29:27.700
What you want more than
anything is to write.

1:29:27.700 --> 1:29:28.860
Because the world that you create

1:29:28.860 --> 1:29:30.800
is so much better than ours.

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:33.510
- Yes to do what I love.

1:29:33.510 --> 1:29:34.650
And I have.

1:29:34.650 --> 1:29:36.730
- And how was it?

1:29:36.730 --> 1:29:37.670
- It was...

1:29:39.015 --> 1:29:42.348
(waves gently crashing)

1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:47.473
beautiful.

1:29:50.290 --> 1:29:52.560
- You know I can't let
you get away with this.

1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:53.393
- I know.

1:29:53.393 --> 1:29:55.080
But you can give me a chance.

1:29:55.080 --> 1:29:57.070
And I know you will.

1:29:57.070 --> 1:30:00.740
Because for the first time,
you've met your match.

1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:02.863
You found a challenge.

1:30:04.180 --> 1:30:06.170
I've already found what I desire.

1:30:06.170 --> 1:30:07.160
I've even had to stop others

1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:08.683
having something too valuable.

1:30:09.675 --> 1:30:11.530
Maybe it's time for you and your partner

1:30:11.530 --> 1:30:12.980
to search for the same thing.

1:30:14.171 --> 1:30:15.940
- [Cary] That's what
writers call catharsis.

1:30:15.940 --> 1:30:18.630
- Exactly, the quick, bubbling emotions,

1:30:18.630 --> 1:30:19.960
the purifying outbreak.

1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:21.150
- Can I get that light?

1:30:21.150 --> 1:30:22.784
- Yeah.

1:30:22.784 --> 1:30:23.617
- Thanks.

1:30:24.540 --> 1:30:26.200
- You know.

1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:28.540
Maybe not the challenge,
your out of depth,

1:30:28.540 --> 1:30:32.127
too focused on the how and the why.

1:30:33.458 --> 1:30:35.776
- Why'd you do it?

1:30:35.776 --> 1:30:36.693
- Humor me.

1:30:38.090 --> 1:30:39.090
- I think you did it

1:30:40.110 --> 1:30:42.160
because Richard was a scumbag

1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:43.888
and his brother was innocent.

1:30:43.888 --> 1:30:46.600
And, like me, that's who you are.

1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:49.694
- Richard was a friend.

1:30:49.694 --> 1:30:51.750
An endearing backstabber,

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:54.760
he wanted something he shouldn't have had.

1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:58.810
We disagreed and we all paid a price.

1:30:58.810 --> 1:30:59.710
- It, what is it?

1:30:59.710 --> 1:31:01.484
You won't say more than it.

1:31:01.484 --> 1:31:03.650
- It outs all our debts.

1:31:03.650 --> 1:31:06.200
It's gone, it's destroyed,
it shouldn't be touched.

1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:11.013
- So what happens now then
in this grand story of yours?

1:31:11.013 --> 1:31:12.600
- Now, I walk away.

1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:13.787
You and James pursue.

1:31:14.657 --> 1:31:15.590
You can catch me.

1:31:15.590 --> 1:31:17.700
If you kill me, you get what you need.

1:31:17.700 --> 1:31:21.060
Clear your name, case solved.

1:31:21.060 --> 1:31:25.150
If you let me walk away,
maybe you get what you want.

1:31:26.530 --> 1:31:27.363
- Your lighter.

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:30.980
- Give it back to me next time you see me.

1:32:06.077 --> 1:32:06.910
- Well.

1:32:07.810 --> 1:32:08.960
We're nearly there now.

1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:14.003
You realize when we bring him in dead,

1:32:15.110 --> 1:32:16.810
our debt with Faulkner is settled.

1:32:18.410 --> 1:32:20.690
- He won't let us bring him in alive.

1:32:20.690 --> 1:32:22.900
He's created his own world in his stories

1:32:22.900 --> 1:32:25.403
and that means that he's
not afraid of death anymore.

1:32:30.370 --> 1:32:31.720
- You think you can do it?

1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:33.520
When we get there, pull the trigger?

1:32:35.556 --> 1:32:36.806
- I don't know.

1:32:37.797 --> 1:32:39.600
That's what you're here for.

1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:41.617
I can do the things that you can't

1:32:41.617 --> 1:32:43.623
and you can do the things that I can't.

1:32:45.140 --> 1:32:45.973
Or won't.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:49.353
- Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

1:32:51.510 --> 1:32:53.560
- Well, whatever happens,

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:55.550
at least you're wearing boots this time.

1:33:07.508 --> 1:33:10.508
(light piano music)

1:34:43.685 --> 1:34:44.518
Argh!

1:35:44.482 --> 1:35:47.815
(music slowly swelling)

1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:50.450
(grand dramatic music)

1:38:31.331 --> 1:38:34.414
(gentle piano music)

1:40:05.420 --> 1:40:08.253
(water splashing)

1:40:18.931 --> 1:40:22.098
