-[Toby] Holy moly!

00:33.033 --> 00:35.160
[grunts, screams]

00:38.080 --> 00:39.164
What the heck was--?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.875
-[car door closes]
-Huh? [gasps]

00:41.959 --> 00:43.168
[suspenseful music playing]

00:43.252 --> 00:44.962
Oh, what are you doing, Tobes?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.839
Only an idiot races
a creature with four legs.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.549
[panting]

00:49.633 --> 00:50.676
I can do this!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.303
[whimpers]

00:53.637 --> 00:55.389
[screams, pants]

00:55.472 --> 00:58.433
-Whoa!
-[snarling]

00:59.560 --> 01:00.852
[whimpering]

01:00.936 --> 01:02.980
Hop on!

01:03.063 --> 01:05.022
-Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
<i>-Adiós,</i> fire cat.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.900
[engine revs, sputters]

01:07.651 --> 01:08.819
[snarling]

01:08.902 --> 01:11.113
Hey, maybe save the jokes
for when we aren't gonna die.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.573
-Come on!
-[tires screeching]

01:14.408 --> 01:15.325
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:15.409 --> 01:18.996
I can't believe you took that stupid rock
to your science class!

01:19.079 --> 01:21.623
First, it's not a rock.
It's volcanic slag.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.584
And how was I supposed to know
there was a flaming monster hiding in it?

01:24.668 --> 01:28.839
You bought a magic rock off a troll
named "Mervin the Monster Dealer."

01:28.922 --> 01:30.340
What did you think
would happen, Tobes?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.927
-Blinky, please tell me you got it!
-Of course, Master Jim.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.430
You've lured the luminaire
right into our stratagem.

01:36.513 --> 01:40.392
-Stra-ta-gem? [sniffs]
-It means "brilliant trap."

01:40.475 --> 01:42.311
[growling]

01:42.394 --> 01:43.228
[roars]

01:45.063 --> 01:47.482
[Jim]
What are you waiting for? Throw it!

01:47.566 --> 01:50.402
Um, Master Jim,
you said this was a luminaire,

01:50.485 --> 01:53.780
when that is obviously
an infernal hellheeti.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.783
[objects shattering, clattering]

01:56.867 --> 02:00.829
-Should I punch it?
-Yeah, let him unleash the fury!

02:00.912 --> 02:02.623
-Not yet, Aaarrrgghh.
-It came from a rock!

02:02.706 --> 02:05.542
How many four-legged flaming creatures
come out of rocks?

02:05.626 --> 02:08.336
As a matter of fact, 11.
Thirteen, if you consider--

02:08.419 --> 02:10.130
Can I punch it?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.798
-[both] Yes!
-No!

02:11.882 --> 02:13.884
[growling]

02:14.801 --> 02:17.179
[panting]

02:17.262 --> 02:21.683
-[gasps]
-[snarling]

02:21.767 --> 02:25.896
I was going to add, "Make sure you
do not feed the fire by attacking it!"

02:25.979 --> 02:27.856
-Oops.
-[gasps]

02:27.939 --> 02:32.611
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.820
Oh, my gosh.
[whimpers]

02:33.904 --> 02:36.782
If we don't want to feed the fire,
how do we put it out?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.785
You have sour sap,
dew dredge, lumpkin oil--

02:39.868 --> 02:41.662
-What about water?
-That's the obvious one.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.372
Where would we get enough of that?

02:43.455 --> 02:44.956
A hellheeti hydrant!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.043
-Aaarrrgghh?
-On it.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.021
[roars]

03:15.946 --> 03:17.197
[laughing]

03:17.280 --> 03:20.826
-Boom, boom.
-<i>Adiós,</i> fire cats.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.830
Well done, Master Jim.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.374
Another victory for our Trollhunter.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.000
"Trollhunters."

03:29.084 --> 03:31.294
Come on, guys, it's a team effort.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.882
Uh, guys, the fire hydrant--
Close enough.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.636
It's getting close to dawn.
You guys better get back to Trollmarket.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.099
[cat meows]

04:19.091 --> 04:20.844
-Morning, Mom.
-Hi.

04:23.138 --> 04:27.350
-Made your favorite breakfast.
-Sorry, kiddo. In a rush.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.482
She passed up your famous
egg white manchego omelet?

04:33.565 --> 04:35.400
-Yep.
-I mean, it's been like a month,

04:35.484 --> 04:38.195
and she's still not talking to you
about the whole hospital thing?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.821
-Not a word.
-Brutal.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.323
You know a woman is beyond angry

04:41.406 --> 04:43.533
when she starts dishing out
the silent treatment.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.286
I don't know how to fix this
unless I tell her the truth.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.705
But if I do, they'll send me
to the crazy house.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.624
Then you had to go
and make things worse

04:50.707 --> 04:52.584
by promising Claire
you were gonna save her brother.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.129
He's trapped in the Darklands.
I can't just leave him there, Tobes.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.590
You know who else
is in the Darklands? Gunmar.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.550
[sighs]
Don't remind me.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.345
[girls giggling]

05:03.428 --> 05:09.059
-Oh, no. Dillweed, five o'clock.
-Lake, Jumbo.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.395
They fixed your tooth.
Now, all they gotta do is fix your face.

05:12.479 --> 05:16.191
What did you just say?
When I get you alone, payback's coming.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.610
Pooh!
[chuckles]

05:18.693 --> 05:20.654
[school bell rings]

05:22.155 --> 05:22.989
Ugh.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.158
[Mary] I heard he was run
out of town by the mob.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.703
I heard he got a mail-order bride
and moved to North Korea.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.873
As if. Where do you think
Mr. Strickler went, Jimmy-Jam?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.125
-You should know. You were his fave.
-Who, me?

05:34.209 --> 05:37.587
[chuckles] Oh, uh... I don't know.
He probably just needed a vacation.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.214
You really think
Strickler might come back?

05:39.297 --> 05:42.759
After what went down, he'd be a fool
to ever show his face again.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.678
So when are we saving my brother?

05:44.761 --> 05:47.347
Claire, we can't just waltz
into the Darklands.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.058
We just saved the trolls
by keeping Killahead Bridge closed.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.186
Imagine what they'll do to us
if they find out we want to open it.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.691
Guys, this is my brother
and Notenrique's driving me nuts.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.609
You know how many times
I have to change him?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.487
He knows how to use the toilet.
He chooses the diaper.

06:02.571 --> 06:06.199
I get it. We'll get him back.
We just can't risk releasing Gunmar.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.118
Admit it, you're going back on your word.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.120
-I'm not.
-You are.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.497
-I am not.
-[school bell rings]

06:12.581 --> 06:13.582
Are.

06:13.665 --> 06:17.085
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
Blinky said we can bring you.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.879
To Trollmarket? Seriously? When?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.756
-Are we going now?
-After school.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.967
But try not to let the whole world know.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.219
All right, butts in seats. You too, Nuñez.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.639
Since Strickler's a no-show,
I'm subbin' in.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.766
We got some book-learnin' to do.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.687
You spend so much time with Lake,
you're practically swimming in him.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.314
We're just friends. End of story.

06:37.397 --> 06:42.402
Okay, people, who can tell me
what happened in the year 1989?

06:42.485 --> 06:46.948
No, seriously, I don't remember.
It was a crazy year. Really, Palchuk?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.369
You ready?

06:51.453 --> 06:54.623
If this helps me get my brother back,
yeah, I'm ready.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.335
Just remember,
saving Enrique is our little secret.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.796
-If any of them were to find out--
-Don't worry, lips are sealed.

07:01.880 --> 07:06.176
Now, you're gonna want
to start drawing a semi-circle.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.553
Oh! You have it. Okay, never mind.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.063
[sighs]

07:18.563 --> 07:19.606
Wow!

07:28.782 --> 07:32.744
The crystal staircase. This is more
than I... I-I never would have...

07:32.827 --> 07:36.498
Oh... Hold up a sec!
We need a few ground rules here, okay?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.333
The locals are not friendly to outsiders.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.336
The first time we came here,
Jim almost got killed.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.547
-You think she heard any of that?
-Not a word.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.429
It's...

07:52.138 --> 07:54.891
[sighs]
It's beautiful.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.144
Welcome to Heartstone Trollmarket.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.731
This place is beyond--
It's beyond beyond!

08:01.815 --> 08:04.901
I want to live down here.
Can I live down here?

08:04.985 --> 08:08.238
Mm, yeah, no, I don't think so.
I don't think that's a good id--

08:08.321 --> 08:10.073
-[trolls grumbling]
-[gnome chattering angrily]

08:10.156 --> 08:12.075
-[grunts]
-[troll] Is that a fleshbag?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.743
[gasps]

08:15.954 --> 08:17.080
[grunts]

08:17.163 --> 08:18.748
[sighs]

08:18.832 --> 08:21.501
-You're... You're...
-Aaarrrgghh.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.087
Well, if it isn't the fair Claire.

08:24.170 --> 08:28.008
-We've been expecting you.
-Blinkous Galadrigal.

08:28.091 --> 08:32.595
Jim told me you helped him face Draal
and slay Bular. And that Vespa!

08:32.679 --> 08:36.599
Best birthday ever. Your wisdom must
rival that of the Venerable Bedehilde.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.520
[gasps] You've read
<i>A Brief Recapitulation of Troll Lore</i> ?

08:40.602 --> 08:43.732
Volumes 1 through 47. It took me a while
to decipher the symbols.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.235
But once I got past the Fifth Declension,
I started to get the hang of it.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.236
[laughs]

08:48.319 --> 08:51.531
She read the book. She read the book!

08:52.866 --> 08:53.825
She's a flower.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.786
[gasps] Bagdwella's Fine Gifts!
Is that where Toby adopted the gnome?

08:56.870 --> 09:00.290
What's a Rotgut's? Is it food?
Oh, is that the Troll Pub?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.958
[troll]
There goes the market.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.881
[clapping]

09:09.758 --> 09:10.967
[gasps]

09:12.719 --> 09:15.388
You're Vendel, aren't you?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.849
Claire Nuñez.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.895
I am so humbled you've accepted me,
the first human female in Trollmarket?

09:21.978 --> 09:25.065
No! I accepted a human Trollhunter

09:25.148 --> 09:27.484
and allowed the pudgy one
to stay for moral support.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.196
But this? A third? It's an infestation!

09:31.279 --> 09:33.156
Vendel, I, um... I can ex--

09:33.239 --> 09:38.203
[speaking foreign language]

09:38.286 --> 09:39.788
She speaks Troll.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.625
[gasps] And Trollmarket is honored
to have you as well.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.627
Oh, Blinkous!

09:45.710 --> 09:50.924
If only the amulet had chosen
such a learned and delightful fleshbag.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.343
-Hey!
-[grunts]

09:53.426 --> 09:54.761
[chuckles]

09:55.970 --> 09:58.932
-You speak Troll?
-Yes. Notenrique's been tutoring me.

09:59.015 --> 10:03.645
That was awesome, Claire.
Vendel loves you and he hates everyone!

10:03.728 --> 10:08.733
Mr. Blinky, Trollmarket is amazing
and there's so many cool things.

10:08.817 --> 10:12.278
But if it's okay,
there's one thing I have to see.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.464
[rattling]

10:56.781 --> 10:58.575
The bridge.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.579
More specific...
what used to be Killahead Bridge.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.915
Every piece accounted for,
even the Eye Stone.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.420
Hopefully, this will give the girl
some closure.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.674
She does understand
why we cannot allow the bridge to open?

11:14.757 --> 11:15.925
Well, you said it yourself,

11:16.009 --> 11:18.761
we'd be fools to open the bridge
and risk letting Gunmar out.

11:18.845 --> 11:23.266
-Right, Jim?
-Oh, of course. We'd be crazy to do that.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.603
Hey, buddy, it's your sis.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.314
Don't you start thinking
I've forgotten about you.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.109
We're gonna get you back. I promise.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.111
See you soon, little chicharrón.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.739
[sniffles]

11:40.617 --> 11:42.785
Thank you for giving me that.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.579
Young Tobias, would you be so kind

11:44.662 --> 11:46.706
as to give Miss Claire
the rest of the tour?

11:46.789 --> 11:49.375
I need to share a word
with our Trollhunter.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.504
Prepare yourself
for the Sacred Grounds,

11:53.588 --> 11:57.717
where Trollhunters are broken
and remade into warriors.

12:00.094 --> 12:05.224
The Hero's Forge!

12:05.308 --> 12:07.477
All this for one Trollhunter?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.188
I mean, I train here, too,
when we need to up our game,

12:10.271 --> 12:12.649
get ripped, maximize our squat cores.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.859
-You know, hero stuff.
-Whoa!

12:14.943 --> 12:21.449
-Is that Draal? Kanjigar's son?
-In the flesh... stone. Stone flesh.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.077
What's that statue he's making?

12:24.160 --> 12:29.749
I do not make statues. This is my father.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.918
Took a while to track down
all his remains.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.088
Hate to be there when we have
to rebuild Jim, right? What a mess.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.799
Well, I just grossed myself out.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.761
You fight in an arena surrounded
by the remains of dead Trollhunters?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.555
That is...

12:44.639 --> 12:47.308
the most heroic thing
I've ever seen.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.103
-Can we turn it on?
-Maybe now's not the best time.

12:50.186 --> 12:54.023
The drive belt's slipping.
Pass me the wrench.

12:54.107 --> 12:58.778
-Hey, you're right.
-So, you brought Claire to Trollmarket.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.698
You really like this girl.
No secrets between you two.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.908
Screwdriver?

13:03.992 --> 13:06.828
I thought you liked her too, Blink.
Everyone else did.

13:06.911 --> 13:11.332
Ah! She's lovely. I can see why
you'd go to the ends of the Earth for her.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.876
Or say, the Darklands?

13:13.960 --> 13:18.006
Sometimes, the heart leads you down
paths you should not cross.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.091
-How did you--?
-Figure it out?

13:20.174 --> 13:24.095
Your devotion to this girl is as obvious
as a glow worm to a huldre fish.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.848
Blinky, it's her brother.
I made her a promise. I--

13:26.931 --> 13:30.101
But you know the danger.
If you went in alone, you'd be killed.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.688
Which is why <i>we </i> will answer every call.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.190
You said I have
to answer every call. Now--

13:36.274 --> 13:39.318
-Wait, did you just say "we"?
-Aaarrrgghh and I discussed it.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.946
We knew you were going in,
with or without our approval.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.033
But... if Claire's brother
is important to you,

13:45.116 --> 13:47.035
then he's important to us.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.954
For folly or for fraught, we are a team.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.666
[panting]

13:53.750 --> 13:54.959
Spit it out, Bagdwella.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.254
Your friends are about
to be turned into pâté!

13:58.337 --> 13:59.338
[suspenseful music playing]

14:04.719 --> 14:08.181
-Claire!
-I'm fine for now. Help him!

14:08.264 --> 14:10.475
-I swear, I didn't touch anything!
-[Draal] The controls!

14:10.558 --> 14:12.727
[grunts]
This blasted arm!

14:12.810 --> 14:15.605
There's a manual kill switch
inside the Soothscryer!

14:15.688 --> 14:17.356
Go, Master Jim!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.612
-[grunts]
-[screaming]

14:22.695 --> 14:24.739
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh-- [screams]

14:24.822 --> 14:25.948
[grunts]

14:27.325 --> 14:29.327
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! [screams]

14:29.410 --> 14:32.288
[sighs] Thanks, Jimbo.
You make it look so easy.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.166
-Okay, I can use your help now.
-Aaarrrgghh!

14:35.249 --> 14:36.501
[grunts]

14:37.085 --> 14:39.921
-Hey! [screams]
-[grunts] Gotcha.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.592
-I'm coming! Just hold on!
-Turn it off!

14:45.760 --> 14:47.929
[grunting]

14:55.686 --> 14:56.771
[screams]

14:56.854 --> 14:58.106
-[rattling]
-[grunting]

14:58.189 --> 15:00.358
[breathing uneasily]

15:00.441 --> 15:02.276
[grunting]

15:02.360 --> 15:05.029
[screaming]

15:05.113 --> 15:06.614
[gears squeaking]

15:08.699 --> 15:09.951
[panting]

15:18.709 --> 15:20.753
-Is this normal?
-Nothing's normal around here.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.004
Get used to it, sister.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.968
-Uh--
-[all gasp]

15:27.927 --> 15:31.055
It's calling to him, at last.

15:33.724 --> 15:34.642
[screams]

15:38.646 --> 15:42.108
-Jim? Jim? Jim?
-No Jim.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.734
What do you mean, "No Jim"?

15:43.818 --> 15:47.738
-There was definitely a Jim.
-He has been summoned.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.624
Hello?

15:58.708 --> 16:00.168
[voice echoing]

16:00.251 --> 16:02.795
[echoing]
Toby? Blinky?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.965
-[male voice] <i>He's useless.</i>
-[female voice] <i>Unwelcome.</i>

16:06.048 --> 16:09.594
-[male voice] <i>A mistake has been made.</i>
-[female voice] <i>Leave this place.</i>

16:09.677 --> 16:11.262
Who are you? Where am I?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.890
<i>-He is but a child.</i>
<i>-A human, no less!</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:15.641
Are you worthy?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.575
[grunts, gasps]

16:33.618 --> 16:37.538
[gasps]
But only a Trollhunter can wield Daylight.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.123
We <i>are </i> Trollhunters!

16:39.207 --> 16:40.500
[voice echoing]

16:40.583 --> 16:42.168
You're Kanjigar.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.045
The voice from my amulet,
that was you!

16:44.128 --> 16:46.756
<i>-Your amulet?</i>
<i>-Our amulet.</i>

16:46.839 --> 16:50.092
<i>We are the Council of Elder Trollhunters.</i>

16:52.762 --> 16:55.473
Oh, man! Now, I'm dead!

16:55.556 --> 16:58.142
That stupid Soothscryer
killed me in the Forge.

16:58.226 --> 17:03.814
You are not dead.
You are still in the Forge, in a way.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.275
This is the Void.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.444
A place between worlds

17:08.528 --> 17:12.865
for the Trollhunter to receive counsel
from those who came before.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.534
We've been waiting and watching.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.619
Growing restless
until you've proven yourself.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.998
The arena going haywire, that was you?

17:21.082 --> 17:23.834
Wait, you've been watching me?

17:23.917 --> 17:26.253
There are no secrets here.

17:27.003 --> 17:30.716
-[Jim screaming]
-[Bular screaming]

17:36.639 --> 17:41.060
We've seen all.
Your triumphs and your deceptions.

17:41.143 --> 17:45.815
<i>I get it. We'll get him back.</i>
<i>We just can't risk releasing Gunmar.</i>

17:45.898 --> 17:48.568
We know what you plan to do,
young Trollhunter.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.486
You court danger and death.

17:50.570 --> 17:55.449
-We have to go.
-"We"? A Trollhunter works alone.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.035
If you bring those you care for
into the Darklands,

17:58.119 --> 18:00.121
you all will be swallowed by it.

18:00.204 --> 18:04.709
To be a Trollhunter
is to make sacrifices.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.712
I had to distance myself from my son
to keep him safe.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.840
Something you have failed to do!

18:10.923 --> 18:12.508
[voice echoing]

18:26.564 --> 18:28.107
Look, I'm not perfect. I know.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.778
But maybe my friends are the reason
I'm the only one here still... breathing?

18:32.862 --> 18:35.197
<i>-Blasphemy!</i>
<i>-He mocks us!</i>

18:35.281 --> 18:38.492
<i>-Leave this place!</i>
<i>-A mistake has been made.</i>

18:38.576 --> 18:42.038
What do you mean, he's in the Void?
The Void sounds like a very empty word.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.331
-A bad word.
-Yeah.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.541
And are these happy ghosts
we're talking about here,

18:45.625 --> 18:47.918
or soul-sucking poltergeists?

18:48.002 --> 18:51.005
They will not suck his soul.
They will merely peer into it.

18:51.088 --> 18:55.343
He is now under the spiritual guidance
of Master Trollhunters.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.804
Ghost guidance counselors?
Jim gets all the cool stuff.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.806
[gasping]

19:01.807 --> 19:03.142
[grunting]

19:03.225 --> 19:05.686
Hey! You're back
from the other side, dude!

19:05.770 --> 19:07.730
Wow! So trolls and ghosts exist.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.983
What's next?
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> ? Fairies?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.360
Fairies? Preposterous!

19:12.443 --> 19:15.613
Fairies lost the war to the pixies
centuries ago.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.240
-What did they say?
-They said they won't stop us.

19:18.324 --> 19:22.870
-What would my father stop you from?
-From going into the Darklands.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.163
But if we're going in,

19:24.246 --> 19:27.166
they said the only way
we're getting out alive

19:27.249 --> 19:29.710
is if we kill Gunmar.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.630
And with Strickler gone,
maybe we have a chance.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.675
[birds squawking]

19:36.092 --> 19:38.761
[grunting]

19:40.179 --> 19:41.389
[grunting]

19:42.264 --> 19:45.142
-How much further, Otto?
-Should be just up ahead, <i>mein Freund.</i>

19:45.226 --> 19:48.187
The old tomes were cryptic
on his whereabouts.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.775
[gasping]

20:26.392 --> 20:29.186
-[Otto gasps]
-[sighs]

20:29.270 --> 20:33.649
-Here.
-[gasps] The Inferna Copula.

20:34.942 --> 20:35.860
[chuckles]

20:43.909 --> 20:48.748
-Is, uh... Is he alive?
-Don't look at me. [scoffs]

20:49.498 --> 20:50.583
[grunts]

20:51.667 --> 20:53.419
Huh?
[breathing heavily]

20:53.502 --> 20:54.378
[grunts]

20:56.839 --> 20:57.923
[whimpering]

20:58.507 --> 20:59.341
[grunts]

21:00.634 --> 21:02.803
[moaning]

21:02.887 --> 21:04.180
-[yelps]
-[both gasp]

21:04.263 --> 21:05.639
[screams]

21:08.267 --> 21:12.146
Who has awakened me?

21:13.606 --> 21:16.400
I have, Angor Rot.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.612
You know my name.

21:19.695 --> 21:23.949
A shame I will never know yours.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.121
Oh...

21:40.966 --> 21:42.635
[roars]

21:44.011 --> 21:46.931
[grunting]

21:47.014 --> 21:49.558
My ring.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.643
My flesh.

21:52.269 --> 21:57.983
Yield to me!
For I wear the Inferna Copula.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.944
[grunts]

22:00.986 --> 22:05.908
You have killed thousands.
You are chaos incarnate.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.245
And you are...

22:09.328 --> 22:10.287
mine.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.583
[laughing]
