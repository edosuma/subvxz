WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:11.980
âSPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH!
âAHEM.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.140
THANKS FOR COMING, GUYS.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.020
AS YOU ALL KNOW,
THIS IS A BIG DAY FOR ME.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.100
I'VE BEEN HERE AT THE PARK
FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.500
I'VE SPENT A GOOD CHUNK
OF MY LIFE UP IN THAT ROOM,

00:19.600 --> 00:21.100
BUT IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.020
YOU DON'T GROW
BY STANDING STILL.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.380
I'VE DECIDED
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE...

00:25.480 --> 00:28.740
TO TRAMPY ââ
THE TRAMPOLINE THAT I SLEEP ON.
( LIGHT APPLAUSE )

00:28.840 --> 00:31.540
I JUST HAD TO SAY,
"RIGBY, YOU'RE A MAN NOW.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.220
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE."

00:33.320 --> 00:34.820
ALSO, I WON A SWEET NEW BED

00:34.920 --> 00:37.060
IN THE 82nd ANNUAL "HOTDOG HORF"
THIS WEEKEND.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.740
WHAT WILL BECOME
OF OLD TRAMPY?

00:39.840 --> 00:42.160
I'M GONNA SEND HER OFF
IN STYLE.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.940
DOES ANYONE WANT TO SAY
A FEW WORDS?

00:45.040 --> 00:46.500
CAN WE WRAP THIS UP?

00:46.600 --> 00:48.980
THERE'S LOT OF PIPES IN THE PARK
THAT NEED SNAKING.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.820
RIGHT. SURE.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.560
( BREATHES DEEPLY )

00:54.640 --> 00:57.020

01:06.280 --> 01:08.280
( APPLAUSE )

01:11.480 --> 01:14.620
YOU READY?
âAS I'LL EVER BE.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.720
FAREWELL, OLD FRIEND.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.340
AHH.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.980
NEW BEGINNINGS,
RIGHT, MORDECAI?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.020
SORRY THE BED'S SO BIG.
âIT'S COOL.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.900
AT LEAST IT SMELLS BETTER
THAN TRAMPY. NIGHT, DUDE.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.940
GOOOOOD NIGHT.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.500
( YAWNS )

01:35.600 --> 01:37.580
MM.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.580

01:38.680 --> 01:40.300
DIDN'T REALLY TAKE.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.560
( YAWNS )

01:45.480 --> 01:47.100
HUH.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.460

01:56.920 --> 02:00.260
CAN'T...GET...COMFORTABLE.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.060
DON'T PANIC, RIGBY.
IT'S JUST A NEW EXPERIENCE.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.260
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.460
( Voice breaking ) TRAMPY.
I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.220
( GARBAGE TRUCK BEEPING )
( SCREAMS )

02:10.320 --> 02:12.380
WAIT! STOP!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.060
( PANTING )

02:14.160 --> 02:16.140
STOP!

02:16.240 --> 02:19.380
NO SECOND CHANCES.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.620
( CRIES ) TRAMPY.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.280
NO!

02:26.400 --> 02:28.300
( GROANS )

02:28.400 --> 02:30.360
DUDE, THE GARBAGE MAN
PROBABLY JUST DIDN'T SEE YOU.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.180
HE SAW ME.
I SAW HIM SEE ME.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.300
MORDECAI, YOU GOT TO HELP ME
GET IT BACK.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.300
NO WAY.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.780
âOH, PLEASE.
âNO.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.060
OH, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.500
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.740
OH, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE!

02:42.840 --> 02:45.120
UGH. FINE.
I'LL GO GET THE KART.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.220
HI, SIR. WE NEED TO GO
IN THERE SO I CAN GET
MY TRAMPOLINE BACK.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.580
WELL, WELL.
THREW AWAY SOMETHING DEAR TO YOU

02:52.680 --> 02:55.020
WITHOUT THINKING IT THROUGH,
DID YOU?

02:55.120 --> 02:56.860
YEAH.
SO CAN WE GO IN, OR...

02:56.960 --> 02:58.340
YOU'LL FIND YOUR TRAMPOLINE

02:58.440 --> 03:02.020
AT THE VERY TIP OF GARBAGE
MOUNTAIN IN ZIGGY'S SHACK.

03:02.120 --> 03:05.420
BUT BEWARE! THERE ARE
MANY PITFALLS ALONG THE WAY,

03:05.520 --> 03:08.820
AND ZIGGY DOES NOT TAKE KINDLY
TO VISITORS.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.820
FIND YOUR ITEM
AND ESCAPE BEFORE SUNDOWN,

03:11.920 --> 03:14.500
OR FACE
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.620
WHY SUNDOWN?

03:15.720 --> 03:17.620
LIABILITY.
IT'S A UNION THING.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.860
FINE. JUST LET US IN.
CAN WE JUST COME IN?

03:19.960 --> 03:23.740
OH, THAT'S NOT UP TO ME.
THAT'S A JOB FOR THE GATEKEEPER.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.220
( BOTH GROAN )

03:25.320 --> 03:27.660
THROUGH THIS GATE
YOU TWO CAN GO,

03:27.760 --> 03:30.060
IF THE ANSWER TO THIS RIDDLE
YOU KNOW.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.420
DUDE, LOOK. LET'S JUST GO
THROUGH THAT HOLE IN THE FENCE.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.500
HâHEY, HEY!
DON'T YOU DO THAT!

03:34.600 --> 03:36.380
YâYOU'RE LUCKY
I'M TRAPPED IN THIS GATE!

03:36.480 --> 03:39.400
( GRUNTS ) IT SMELLS LIKE
MUSCLE MAN'S COUCH CUSHIONS.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.460
Both: WHOOOOA!

03:44.560 --> 03:46.940
THIS IS THE HUGEST DUMP
I'VE EVER SEEN.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.220
EH, I'VE SEEN BIGGER.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.300
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.680
( SIGHS )
WE START WALKING.

03:55.640 --> 03:59.180
SHEESH, DID OUR TOWN
MAKE ALL OF THIS?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.540
AW, COME ON!

04:00.640 --> 04:01.700
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.220
( GROANS )
WE'RE WALKING IN CIRCLES.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.580
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

04:04.680 --> 04:06.940
WE'VE PASSED THIS STUPID OLD
CAN OF CORN FIVE TIMES.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.820
WHO YOU CALLING OLD,
YOU JERK?

04:09.920 --> 04:11.020
( GASPS )

04:11.120 --> 04:12.660
DUDE.
THAT CAN JUST TALKED.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.220
YOU'RE DARN RIGHT, I DID!

04:14.320 --> 04:16.780
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING
KICKED AROUND LIKE GARBAGE.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.940
I MEAN, I LITERALLY AM GARBAGE,
BUT I STILL DON'T APPRECIATE IT.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.380
GEEZ, SORRY, MAN.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.480
WE'RE JUST HERE
TO GET MY TRAMPOLINE BACK.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.340
I THREW IT OUT BY ACCIDENT.
âGET IT BACK?!

04:25.440 --> 04:28.060
I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS REALIZE
HOW THIS PLACE WORKS.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.500
ZIGGY AIN'T GONNA ALLOW
THAT.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.460
HUH? WHO'S THIS ZIGGY GUY?
THE KING OF THE DUMP?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.620
YEAH,
AND HE'LL MESS YOU UP.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.660
I'M GONNA BE STRAIGHT
WITH YOU GUYS. THIS PLACE SUCKS.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.540
YOU SHOULD CUT YOUR LOSSES
AND GO HOME.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.380
NO WAY!
NOT WITHOUT TRAMPY.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.580
WAIT.
YOU LIVE HERE, RIGHT?

04:42.680 --> 04:44.260
COULDN'T YOU JUST TAKE US
TO ZIGGY?

04:44.360 --> 04:46.260
ME?
WâWâWHOA, THERE.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.360
I GOT, UH ââ
I GOT TO GO.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.660
GOOD LUCK!

04:50.760 --> 04:52.300
( BIRD CAWING )
âFINE!

04:52.400 --> 04:55.500
THE ONLY CAN WE NEED
IS OUR CANâDO ATTITUDE.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.160
COME ON, MAN. WE'RE GONNA FIND
TRAMPY WITH OR WITHOUT HIM.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.420
HE LOOKS MAD. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO IF HE GETS HERE?

05:04.520 --> 05:05.940
âQUIET!
âWHOA!

05:06.040 --> 05:09.760
THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT
PAST THE FROZEN CAVES.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.300
MAN, WHAT KIND OF DUMP
HAS CAVES?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.140
Both: WHOOOOA!

05:16.240 --> 05:18.300
LOOK AT ALL
THESE BROKEN TVs.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.860

I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
TO ZIGGY'S SHACK.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.500
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW TO GET THERE? WE'RE LOST.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.140
<i>OF COURSE WE KNOW THE WAY.</i>

05:36.240 --> 05:38.460

07:56.880 --> 07:59.380
YOU WOULDN'T BE SO TOUGH
WITHOUT YOUR MINIONS.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.980
YOU REALLY WANT TRAMPY SO BADLY.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.020
IF YOU WANT THE THING
FOR WHICH YOU CAME,

08:04.120 --> 08:05.860
YOU MUST DEFEAT ME IN A GAME.

IF YOU CROSS THE FINISH LINE
FIRST, YOU CAN KEEP TRAMPY.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.820
IF YOU FALL,
YOU'LL RELINQUISH IT TO ME.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.540
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT, RIGBY.
NO SECOND CHANCES.

DUDE, I JUST WATCHED YOU FALL
TO YOUR DEATH!

09:22.120 --> 09:24.700
YOU'RE LITERALLY TAKING A SECOND
CHANCE AT LIFE RIGHT HERE.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.980
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
DID I GET A SECOND CHANCE

WHEN I ACCIDENTALLY THREW MY
PORTABLE CASSETTE PLAYER AWAY

09:30.160 --> 09:32.340
20 YEARS AGO?
NO!

09:32.440 --> 09:36.020
AND DID I GET A SECOND CHANCE
WHEN I BROKE INTO THE DUMP

09:36.120 --> 09:37.340
AND THEY CAUGHT ME

09:37.440 --> 09:40.740
AND THE JUDGE MADE ME LIVE
IN THE DUMP AS PUNISHMENT?

09:40.840 --> 09:41.980
NO!

09:42.080 --> 09:43.620
WAIT, THEY MADE YOU LIVE
AT THE DUMP?

09:43.720 --> 09:44.900
FOR 20 YEARS?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.020
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
IT WAS JUST FOR ONE NIGHT,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.700
LIKE A "SCARED STRAIGHT!"
THING.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.660
BUT I GOT USED TO IT.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.420
NOW, HAND OVER TRAMPY
BEFORE I MAKE YOUR FRIEND
