00:03.440 --> 00:06.120
Elke Sommer to block.
Elke Sommer to block.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.560
Donna... loved <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>

00:19.640 --> 00:22.240
Ah, Forman. Come on, man.
Give it a rest, huh?

00:22.320 --> 00:26.520
So you're single now. That's a good thing.
Now you're like me, man.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.600
You're free to be with lotsa subpar,
somewhat sleazy chicks.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.000
It's Christmas, baby.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.000
Oh, you disguise your heart, Hyde, but...

00:39.040 --> 00:41.720
I know you need love.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.800
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I need it.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.560
All right. I'm goin' to work before you two
start braidin' each other's hair.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.720
You know what? I wish for once Hyde
would fall in love, you know?

00:57.760 --> 00:59.640
So we could make fun of <i>him.</i>

00:59.680 --> 01:01.800
We'd be all, "Hey, everyone"...

01:05.400 --> 01:07.800
"Hyde's in love."

01:13.800 --> 01:15.720
Burn.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.000
Oh, I know.
Let's get Hyde a woman.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.760
We can have
a "Let's Get Hyde a Woman" party.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.280
And... And we can have food
and music and, um...

01:28.320 --> 01:31.120
- Women?
- That's it.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.520
Hey, this party is a great idea.
I am gonna find the perfect match for Steven.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.120
After all, my nickname
is "The Queen of Romance."

02:14.160 --> 02:15.920
No one calls you that.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.840
Now, we will each bring
no less than two...

02:20.880 --> 02:24.880
and no more than five girls
to the party for Hyde, okay?

02:24.960 --> 02:28.520
I will console the rejects
with a hot oil massage.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.640
I will be nude.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.960
Well, I'm outta here. The radio station's
giving away a van, and I gotta work.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.880
I will be clothed.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.880
Well, I think it's a great idea.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.120
Steven is almost a man,
and he needs to meet a girl...

02:45.200 --> 02:48.640
who will help him find his way.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.480
Yeah. A girl helped me find
my way... to hell! I'm in hell.

02:53.560 --> 02:58.400
Oh, you're not in hell.
If you're too hot, take off your sweater.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.720
- So, it's settled. We'll have the party here.
- No, Kitty.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.080
I don't know
what you're talkin' about, but, no.

03:06.160 --> 03:11.240
Yes. We're... We're havin' a little party
for Steven, so he can meet his Miss Right.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.480
Why is it here?
Why is it always here?

03:16.560 --> 03:19.480
Well, what do you want them to do,
have the party in the street?

03:19.560 --> 03:21.920
Yes.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.560
They puke in the street,
the city cleans it up.

03:27.760 --> 03:32.360
Oh-ho, man!

03:32.400 --> 03:36.360
Oh, I hope I win this van.
I really need a place to do it with Jackie.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.200
Okay. Listen up everybody.
The rules are simple.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.360
You place one hand on the van.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.680
If you remove your hand for any reason,
you're out.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.520
Last person to remove his hand
wins the van.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.920
Any questions?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.280
You're out.
Any other questions?

03:56.360 --> 03:59.400
- Don't start without me, Max.
- Oh, God.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.760
Hello.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.080
My name is Daniel...

04:08.120 --> 04:11.080
and I have won every WFPP contest...

04:11.160 --> 04:16.200
since the Weber Gas Grill
Trampoline Bounce of 1972.

04:17.279 --> 04:21.240
I am unbeatable,
so the choice is yours:

04:21.320 --> 04:24.840
Joy or despair...

04:24.920 --> 04:28.040
pleasure or pain...

04:29.040 --> 04:32.680
life... or death.

04:32.760 --> 04:36.200
I am Daniel!

04:36.240 --> 04:38.920
And I cannot be beaten.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.600
Look at what I brought.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.120
- Big Rhonda?
- Uh-huh.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.680
There goes the keg.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.120
Everybody, look who's here...

05:07.400 --> 05:11.160
a caring, intelligent, snazzy young man...

05:11.240 --> 05:14.440
Ste-e-even Hyde!

05:16.720 --> 05:20.440
Um, thanks.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.160
Hey, man. What's goin' on? I thought
we were watchin' <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

05:23.240 --> 05:28.720
Yeah. Change of plans.
We're havin' a party with girls, a keg...

05:28.800 --> 05:31.120
and girls.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.840
- For no reason whatsoever.
- Great.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.320
- And there's no agenda.
- All right.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.840
Stop grilling me, you bastard!

05:46.320 --> 05:49.080
Oh, hey, Melissa.

05:49.160 --> 05:53.160
- How's the contest going?
- Lame. But at least the boneheads are entertaining.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.960
Check out that idiot's 'fro.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.800
Hey, that's my dad.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.520
- Oh! Uh...
- No.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.920
Okay. Yeah. You're right.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.920
- So, hey, what are you doin' tonight?
- We're in Wisconsin...

06:07.000 --> 06:08.880
so nothing.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.240
Well, I'm goin' to this party. It's in a stinky
basement, and they'll have a stolen keg.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.440
- I'm in.
- Cool.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.520
Hey, Dad. I brought you some mints
and your afro pick.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.360
Oh, thank God, Donna.
My hair was startin' to look silly.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.880
Hey, check out the redhead.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.680
That redhead is my baby girl Donna.
I'm her dad.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.800
I want Donna to call me "Daddy."

06:43.440 --> 06:46.080
- That's it!
- Ah! Bob.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.440
You took your hand off the van.
You lose.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.480
This isn't over.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.600
It is for you.
Get outta here.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.520
And so begins the battle of wits.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.080
Oh, man.
I've never been good at wits.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.720
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.560
So, chips and dip, huh?

07:27.560 --> 07:30.120
Yeah.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.200
And the words kinda sound alike,
so that's always fun.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.520
Look. No offense,
but I'm really not in the mood for talking.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.080
I just... broke up
with my girlfriend, so...

07:44.720 --> 07:47.880
Oh, you poor thing.

07:49.200 --> 07:54.600
You know, you have these sad lips
that are just so hot.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.360
Really?

08:03.040 --> 08:08.720
I may not be popular, but if given the
chance, I'll put out somethin' fierce.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.960
Psst!

08:23.040 --> 08:26.360
Psst! How's it goin'?

08:29.040 --> 08:33.280
Great, great, great, great. 'Cause, see,
at first, I thought I should wear my hair up.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.320
But... let's be honest.
My hair is one of my top five features.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.840
So, voilÃ ! It's down.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.200
Psst! Psst!

08:47.520 --> 08:51.560
Hyde, allow me to introduce you
to a special lady.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.640
So we meet every week to pray
and discuss Scripture. You in?

08:57.080 --> 09:01.560
I used to date your dad.
Isn't that a turn-on?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.880
It's not like head cheerleader's
always the most talented...

09:05.960 --> 09:08.640
but in my case, it's true.

09:08.720 --> 09:14.160
I have to date guys who aren't as good-looking
as me, otherwise, I'd never date.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.560
You gonna eat that?

09:21.200 --> 09:24.320
I know you're really angry
and emotionally crippled...

09:24.400 --> 09:28.080
but that's okay,
'cause my boyfriend's in jail.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.960
My turn-offs include people who are mean
to puppies and people who smoke...

09:36.000 --> 09:38.920
or... don't smoke?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.840
Or smoke?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.920
Wait. Do you smoke?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.760
Okay. So guess which leg's real.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.120
I'm so glad I finally got to meet you, 'cause
I've, like, always been afraid of you...

09:54.160 --> 09:56.560
and I like to be scared.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.200
So? What do you think?

10:06.240 --> 10:09.120
You know, I think, if I time this right...

10:09.200 --> 10:12.080
I can nail
every single one of these girls...

10:12.160 --> 10:14.000
tonight.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.320
No, no, no, no, no. You're supposed
to pick just one... to love, not nail.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.080
Love.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.000
Yeah. Right.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.560
Okay. Listen to me, Johnny Cool.

10:25.640 --> 10:30.120
I threw this party for you, so you can find one
girlfriend to love you. And that is all. One.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.840
- You set this up?
- Yeah. We all thought you needed help finding a quality woman.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.760
What?

10:37.840 --> 10:40.520
Man, you sit around and talk about me?
Is that what's goin' on?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.920
Look. I don't want your help.

10:42.960 --> 10:47.280
I give and I do,
and I do and I give.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.320
And for what?

10:49.400 --> 10:52.360
For nothing.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.600
Well, I'm done. Go.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.320
- But, Fez...
- I said, <i>go.</i>

11:05.520 --> 11:07.360
- Hey, Hyde.
- Hey.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.120
This is Melissa. She just moved here from
Chicago. Work at the radio station together.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.200
Melissa, this is Hyde.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.560
You're not leaving already, are you?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.720
- Uh, no. I came out to get some fresh air.
- <i>Oh.</i>

11:20.760 --> 11:23.160
It's, uh...
It's fresher out here... the air.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.560
I like air. How 'bout you?

11:27.640 --> 11:29.520
Air's okay.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.680
You know what's really good? Water.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.400
That's really...

11:47.560 --> 11:51.360
This summer I'm gonna visit
my aunt in Mississippi.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.560
Oh, you're goin' away?
That is sad.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.480
Hey, you should come with me,
chocolate milk.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.080
When I looked across the room,
I saw a guy who was wounded...

12:06.160 --> 12:09.000
a guy who sits in the dark
waiting for the light to find him again.

12:13.240 --> 12:17.600
If only I could find
this light you speak of...

12:18.640 --> 12:22.720
then maybe... just... maybe...

12:22.760 --> 12:24.840
my pain might go away.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.880
Would it help if I held you?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.680
I doubt it.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.720
But let's try, Katie.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.760
Yeah. Lower. Yeah.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.640
I am so disgusted.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.640
Oh, I know.
There are way too many girls at this party.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.800
I can't even smell my own perfume.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.400
Well, you're the only one.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.880
You know, you may not even be
the prettiest girl here.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.080
You shut your hole.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.080
I... am... pretty!

13:05.160 --> 13:07.000
Unsure.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.320
Must... find... Michael!

13:14.360 --> 13:17.120
Hi. You know...

13:17.160 --> 13:20.560
I'm a guy who's... wounded.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.920
- So I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- Thanks. Get one for yourself too.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.160
No. I...

13:30.240 --> 13:32.120
Ca...

13:33.760 --> 13:36.440
- Can I get you a beer?
- There you go.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.560
- Thanks.
- Right.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.880
A toast...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.840
to all my good friends.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.040
I will miss you
when I blow out of this burg...

13:52.120 --> 13:54.240
with the beautiful Big Rhonda.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.560
Now it's off to "Missis-syphilis"!

14:05.480 --> 14:09.920
Oh, no. Red, they've been drinking.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.600
Well, well. What do ya know?

14:17.600 --> 14:21.360
Here, Kelso. Thought you might need
some coffee to keep you goin'.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.720
Hey, you know what would be fun?

14:26.800 --> 14:30.560
- Seein' which one of us could drink the most coffee, huh?
- Uh-huh.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.480
Oh, no.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.320
- You'll just lose.
- Wha... No. I would not.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.000
- I could so beat you.
- Well, I doubt that.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.080
- Oh, you're goin' down.
- Hmm.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.160
- That's my six to your one!
- Yeah. Ya really whipped me.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.560
Kelso, have you ever been
to Niagara Falls?

14:52.640 --> 14:56.680
- Uh-uh.
- Hmm. Don't you like the soothing sound of water?

14:56.760 --> 15:00.600
- Yeah. I guess.
- Hmm. You ever sat beside a babbling brook...

15:00.680 --> 15:05.720
listening to the beautiful,
steady stream of water?

15:05.800 --> 15:08.200
Well, I... Okay.
I don't know if you realize this, but...

15:08.280 --> 15:10.880
a-all this talk about water
is really making have to go pee.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry. Yeah.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.040
I can see that "urine"...
a lot of pain.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.760
Yeah. Well, y-you better shut up,
'cause you're gonna have to go too.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.560
That's where you're wrong.
I <i>am</i> going.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.160
I know I just met her, Mr. Red...

15:38.200 --> 15:40.760
but I love her.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.880
She is sturdy.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.920
I want to climb her.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.600
You're just desperate to give it away,
aren't you, son?

15:58.720 --> 16:00.600
Yes. Yes, I am.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.920
Look.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.280
There are two things that you need
to learn about women.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.400
Oh, finally, the sex talk!

16:10.480 --> 16:15.560
First: If a woman outweighs you
by 30 pounds...

16:15.640 --> 16:17.600
you're in for trouble.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.280
But I'll put on weight.
I'll bridge the gap.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.720
Which brings me
to my second point.

16:22.760 --> 16:27.760
When used separately,
women and alcohol can be a lot of fun.

16:27.840 --> 16:33.320
But if you mix 'em,
they can turn you into a dumb-ass.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.560
- Michael!
- Jackie.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.640
- I thought you were at the party.
- No, no, no. It was awful.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.240
Do you know what it's like
to be the prettiest girl at a party...

16:46.320 --> 16:48.240
and not have anyone acknowledge it?

16:49.280 --> 16:51.640
Yes, I do.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.680
- Michael, am I pretty?
- Oh, come on, cupcake.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.480
You are the prettiest girl in Point Place.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.400
No. You know what? In Wisconsin.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.480
Nice one, Pinocchio.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.640
- Am I prettier than Pam Macy?
- Of course.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.520
Am I prettier than Farrah Fawcett?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.319
Oh, all right. Come on.
She's like a perfect 10.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
And you are an 11.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.920
- Am I prettier than...
- Oh, my God!

17:23.880 --> 17:27.160
Am I prettier than the girl
with the feathered hair at the supermarket?

17:27.240 --> 17:29.440
Okay, okay, the blonde-haired one
or the brown-haired one?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.400
Well, does it matter?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.720
No, 'cause ya smoke 'em both, baby!

17:34.760 --> 17:38.080
- Am I prettier than...
- Oh, my God!

17:38.120 --> 17:40.320
I can't take it anymore!

17:40.360 --> 17:44.800
Am I pretty? Am I pretty?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.960
Am I pretty? Shut up!

17:48.040 --> 17:50.680
And we finally have a winner.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.720
I did it!

17:52.800 --> 17:56.720
Oh, my God. I won!
Who's the best? I'm the best!

17:56.800 --> 17:58.640
Loser!

17:58.720 --> 18:01.600
I'm not a loser, okay?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.920
I win everything.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.280
I don't lose. I win!

18:07.360 --> 18:10.000
Because I'm a winner!

18:11.120 --> 18:13.960
I'm a winner!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.880
So, Michael Kelso,
tell Wisconsin how it feels...

18:16.960 --> 18:21.000
to be WFPP's new
Hand 2 Van winner!

18:21.080 --> 18:23.400
Well, I guess I have to say it
like this, Max:

18:23.480 --> 18:25.880
If this van's a-rockin'...

18:25.960 --> 18:27.840
we're in there doin' it!

18:27.880 --> 18:31.200
- Michael!
- Oh. Um, I'm sorry.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.240
I'm doin' it with Jackie Burkhart!

18:36.360 --> 18:41.200
If you really think putting my head
on your lap will make me feel better...

18:42.240 --> 18:44.800
I mean, I guess...

18:44.880 --> 18:46.800
I should try.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.760
All right. That's it.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.520
Excuse me, girls.
I have some information...

18:56.600 --> 18:59.560
No. Don't listen to what she's...
I'm... She's the one who hurt me.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.200
Uh-huh. Yeah. He dumped <i>me.</i>

19:10.960 --> 19:13.160
You dumped her?

19:13.240 --> 19:17.000
Well, I had to. She wouldn't...
She wouldn't take my ring.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.240
You wouldn't take his ring?

19:19.320 --> 19:22.000
This is none of your business.
And you...

19:22.080 --> 19:25.200
are a sad little man.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.960
Tsk. Oh, poor baby.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.720
- Do you want my number?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.360
- So, you havin' fun?
- That reminds me.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.360
I have to go.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.640
Uh, Melissa...

19:41.720 --> 19:45.280
um, I was wonderin' if maybe
you wanted to do somethin' sometime.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.440
Sorry. I did something last night,
and I already made plans for sometime.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.480
No. Wait, wait.
Uh, let me try that again.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.240
Um, look.
If you're not doing anything Friday night...

19:57.320 --> 19:59.960
I'd like to take you out...
to, uh...

20:00.040 --> 20:02.080
to...
to dinner and a movie.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.400
Pizza?

20:05.480 --> 20:07.360
The mall?

20:09.520 --> 20:11.360
Bowling?

20:11.440 --> 20:13.760
I'd love to. Call me.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.320
Call you?
That's a little unorthodox.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.440
I'll call you.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.160
Ye-e-es.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.720
"I'll call you." "I'll call you."

20:26.800 --> 20:29.480
Whipped.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.600
What? I don't care about her.
Melissa who? What the hell.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.320
Whipped like the family pig.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.600
Rhonda, I cannot go to Mississippi.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.080
So, you're not coming?

20:47.160 --> 20:49.560
I'm sorry.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.600
But maybe we can go
to the movies sometime.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.440
And make out in the theater? Yeah!

20:54.520 --> 20:56.360
Call me.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.880
Good God. Sober up, man.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.160
Oh, screw it, Donna.
Fez likes them big.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.960
Fez likes them small.
Fez likes them all.
