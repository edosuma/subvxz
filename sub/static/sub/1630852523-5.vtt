00:12.804 --> 00:15.390
You just can't post pictures
or anything

00:15.473 --> 00:17.642
where you look darker than you are.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.481
Because, bitch, the main thing
people will say about you

00:23.565 --> 00:24.983
is that she blackfishes.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.570
With that situation,
it just kind of sucks,

00:28.653 --> 00:31.865
because that is
my natural skin tone sometimes,

00:31.948 --> 00:35.326
and maybe it's lighting,
and when things come up now,

00:35.410 --> 00:37.954
I'm like, "It's another thing coming up."

00:38.038 --> 00:42.042
"It's another person trying to expose me,
making fake tweets."

00:42.125 --> 00:44.002
Ooh, bitch, I wanna sock you so bad.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.045
Please.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.796
I--

00:46.880 --> 00:49.215
I feel gaslighted.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.928
I will never be friends with a racist.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.766
I hope you would.

00:58.349 --> 01:02.228
But I almost would rather
be painted out to be the bad guy,

01:02.312 --> 01:07.609
as opposed to try to uphold
some standard that I'll never live up to.

01:08.359 --> 01:13.490
As an influencer, our whole lives
are put on this weird pedestal

01:13.573 --> 01:15.450
more than a traditional celebrity.

01:15.533 --> 01:21.206
You have to become a spokesperson,
activist, model, publicist, manager.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.834
You have to be so many things at once,
and it's really scary

01:24.918 --> 01:27.837
'cause you're not allowed
to mess up in any way.

01:27.921 --> 01:34.010
But I also think it's not fair for me to,
like, be so dismissive in a way.

01:34.094 --> 01:38.014
I would never wanna offend anyone,
that's not my intention.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.265
You know, I am sorry.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.977
It's just hard
because I feel like there's never…

01:43.520 --> 01:45.313
There's, like, no winning. You know?

01:45.396 --> 01:49.567
I feel like I have to extra prove
that I'm not a bad person.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.485
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.987
It's been like that my whole life.

01:53.071 --> 01:57.659
Just-- I've been hated on
by, like, my own community, like…

01:58.535 --> 01:59.536
just everyone.

01:59.619 --> 02:05.416
Like, I'm so, almost used to it
that it's like, scary, you know?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.252
I don't wanna become numb.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.003
I mean, I see what you mean.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.380
You have your guard up.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.215
-I know you don't do it intentionally.
-Yeah.

02:12.298 --> 02:17.554
And I get that, but, like,
you still have the opportunity to show,

02:17.637 --> 02:21.266
"Hey, look, it's not the case.
I understand why you're upset."

02:21.349 --> 02:22.976
"And this is me changing for you."

02:23.059 --> 02:24.227
One hundred percent.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.480
All I want from her
is to understand she's hurting others.

02:27.564 --> 02:31.568
I don't expect her to go on Twitter
and apologize, that's her own doing.

02:31.651 --> 02:35.697
But I just want her to be
more caring for other people's feelings,

02:35.780 --> 02:39.033
which I know she is,
'cause she cares about everybody.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.035
I just feel so bad for…

02:42.036 --> 02:42.912
like, you.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.541
You're not the representation
that they want you to be.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.587
When in reality,
we started out just as, like, little kids…

02:50.670 --> 02:53.506
-Yeah.
-…who didn't have attention growing up.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.300
Because of my race and my background,

02:55.383 --> 02:58.219
people do give me
a way harder time than most creators.

02:58.303 --> 03:02.432
But, for you, there's been people
who get called out for the same thing

03:02.515 --> 03:05.059
-that you have been "called out" for…
-Mm-hmm.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.644
…but get way less heat.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.770
Yeah.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.856
You think it's because you're transgender?

03:09.939 --> 03:11.274
Yeah, I don't know.

03:11.983 --> 03:12.984
I think it is.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.739
Being in the LGBT community
and especially for me being trans,

03:17.822 --> 03:21.826
it's like, you're under the scrutiny
and microscope of millions of people,

03:21.910 --> 03:23.912
more so than other creators.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.830
It sucks, and…

03:26.623 --> 03:30.293
I don't know, it's really hard for me
to be real and genuine

03:30.376 --> 03:34.547
because I don't think I… I don't know.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.550
It's almost like turning off
my humanity sometimes, I feel like.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.596
I just want you to just change
because you hear people…

03:41.679 --> 03:42.680
-Mm-hmm.
-…how they feel.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.016
I'm totally self-aware,
I understand it's like…

03:45.099 --> 03:47.518
I give off this mentality
like I don't care,

03:47.602 --> 03:50.939
whatever, this that and the other,
but I know I hurt you, you know?

03:51.606 --> 03:52.774
And it sucks.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.026
I hear you on it, as a friend,

03:55.109 --> 03:57.445
and I thank you for that, for telling me,

03:57.528 --> 03:59.572
-'cause I don't think a lot of people…
-Yeah.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.740
…would sit me down,

04:00.823 --> 04:03.159
or even give me the chance
to have a conversation.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.118
For sure.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.788
If I'm ever wrong
or need to be held accountable,

04:06.871 --> 04:10.500
like, I look to people
who are around me to do so.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.335
-I love you.
-I love you too.

04:12.418 --> 04:16.339
Next time you cross a bitch like me,
just know I got a good right hook.

04:16.422 --> 04:20.885
You have a right hook, but I have man arms
I have not touched, remember that.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.596
I know, bitch,
I've seen how you grab people.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.349
-She-Hulk.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.017
-Can you do me a favor?
-What?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.647
Babe, I was leaving myself.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.065
I hate to see you go.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.651
-But I like to watch her leave.
-Bye, Dragun.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.071
You better walk. Don't turn too fast,
that lace might fall off.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.990
Pull back that hairline, see what happens.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.577
Girl, go put that headband back on.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.670


05:00.883 --> 05:03.469
Don't throw it at my face.
Throw it at my chest area.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.138
-
-Alright, ready?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.809
-I just saved your life.
-It is so scary.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.103
Oh my God, Calvin!

05:12.186 --> 05:13.521
Worst throw ever.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.398
It was right at his dick.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.817
Hello!

05:18.526 --> 05:19.569
Hi, Nikita.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.404
-Hi, Nikita.
-Hey! Hi.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.114
-How are you?
-Hey, Alex.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.949
-What are you doing?
-What am I doing?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.201
I'm resting after-- We played bumper cars.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.079
-What are you doing here?
-You're usually here at nine.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.707
Baby, girls like me
don't come out in the daytime.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.502
-It's 'cause glam takes a while.
-You look great. It's worth it.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.214
Thank you. Well, that being said,
I feel like…

05:40.298 --> 05:41.632
…something inside of me…

05:42.884 --> 05:43.718
Deep down.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.137
I don't wanna know about your sex life.

05:50.266 --> 05:54.520
But, something in me just feels like…
you need to walk on the wild side.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.731
I feel like you need to experience things…

05:56.814 --> 05:59.317
-Right.
-…and you need to elevate your content.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.612
-You know?
-What are you talking about?

06:03.154 --> 06:09.660
I just feel like it could be kind of fun
if you stepped into my stripper heels.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.539
-Are you trying to glam me up?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.666
-You don't have to beg me.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.336
Yes, I'm down.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.962
-When?
-Are you really?

06:20.046 --> 06:20.880
Tomorrow.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.800
Okay, tomorrow I have
to film a couple of things

06:23.883 --> 06:26.386
but what time-- Can you come at one?

06:26.469 --> 06:28.513
-I can come at one.
-Is it a Nikita one?

06:28.596 --> 06:30.390
-Or is it a me one?
-It will be one.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.601
For me, in my past,
it's been so hard to open up to guys.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.145
In the same way
they have assumptions about me,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.689
I have assumptions
that they're not gonna accept me.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.234
-Oh, yeah, you should do Vinnie.
-What?

06:41.317 --> 06:42.860
Vinnie would love it.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.946
I feel like he'd be too pretty.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.366
He'd be so pretty I'd feel intimidated.

06:48.449 --> 06:52.203
No longer do we have this, like,
toxic male masculinity

06:52.286 --> 06:54.872
that's so afraid to express femininity.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.333
Like, you're allowed to play.
Like, why not?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.459
You down?

07:00.086 --> 07:00.920
I don't know.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.966
-Yes, I am down.
-Okay.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.260
-Yay!
-You're gonna eat it up.

07:07.343 --> 07:11.472
Okay, so your homework tonight
is to practice pussy-stunting.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
Like showing my pussy?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.271
-What?
-I don't know, you said "pussy-stunting."

07:18.354 --> 07:20.314
-Pussy-stunting is--
-Do I have to tuck?

07:20.398 --> 07:21.524
-No.
-Okay.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.192
-You can if you want.
-I might.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.195
Pussy-stunting is,
like, walking with confidence,

07:30.074 --> 07:32.660
For me, like, I could walk outside

07:32.743 --> 07:35.037
knowing that at any moment
someone's gonna be like,

07:35.121 --> 07:37.748
-"That's a man," or, "That was a dude."
-Mm-hmm.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.627
And I'll still walk and go get coffee
and keep my head up high.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.463
I did not invent pussy-stunting.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.340
I just happen to be
the number one pussy-stunter of the world.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.801
I'm like the pussy-stunt professor.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.012
I feel like I've taught people
how to pussy-stunt.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.890
-One day I'm going to come in kitchen…
-Full pussy-stunt.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.601
…pussy-stunt, all the way around,
and look at everybody.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.060
-No.
-Don't look at anybody?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.062
-You don't look at anybody.
-Okay. Not looking.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.774
The key is that everybody
is looking at you, but you don't look.

08:03.858 --> 08:04.734
Okay.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.488
My first TikTok was a pussy-stunt.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.997
I said, "Baby, if I'm gonna do a TikTok
for my first moment, it's three outfits."

08:18.080 --> 08:21.167
"Faux fur,
in a parking garage, half-naked."

08:23.544 --> 08:26.255
Welcome, TikTok, you've never
seen a girl like me, but here I am.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.011
With YouTube and Instagram,
you had to follow that person.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.972
Whereas, on TikTok,
it's just this random algorithm

08:35.056 --> 08:39.018
where anyone can open their phone,
and a different person will pop up.

08:39.101 --> 08:44.023
This app put me on
some conservative-ass people's pages,

08:44.106 --> 08:47.485
that probably would never
even want to see a girl like me,

08:47.568 --> 08:50.154
and it just, like, blew up overnight.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.117
This app humbled me, I'm like,

08:55.201 --> 08:57.745
"Wait. So many people in the world
have access to this,

08:57.828 --> 08:59.997
so many people don't know I'm trans."

09:00.081 --> 09:04.043
They're like, "Wait, is this a dude?
Does she have a dick?"

09:04.126 --> 09:08.464
Like, it just got so crazy
and sparked this new chapter in my life.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.674
It's a good chapter.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.509
How full-fantasy do you want?

09:11.592 --> 09:15.388
Do you want a full Nikita Dragun fantasy
or just the tip?

09:16.597 --> 09:18.808
-We can start with just the tip.
-Okay.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.394
-And then see how it goes from there.
-Okay.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.156
-Let's jump off the balcony.
-Go.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.408
Let's do it.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.494


09:38.578 --> 09:39.412


09:39.495 --> 09:40.746
Let go of me, psycho.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.500
-Patrick, let go.
-No.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.793
-I got you.
-If you touch me--

09:49.005 --> 09:50.006
Wee!

09:50.089 --> 09:52.883
-Push them together more.
-Very anticlimactic.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.969
-Yeah, it is.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.429
I have had

09:56.512 --> 10:00.641
47 phone calls so far today,
and 30 chains of text messages.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.647
-No, this is an everyday thing.
-This is a daily thing.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.525
Thomas has been having meetings
to encourage content for a while.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.656
You have to do one video a month,
that's it.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.908
To live in a mansion for free.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.745
Vinnie asked someone to make a TikTok,
they said, "No."

10:20.828 --> 10:22.288
It was Chase.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.958
It's like, Calvin, Pat,
and all of them, they have no motivation.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.085
That was a nice plant.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.671
They don't pay rent,
they don't have a lot to do,

10:30.755 --> 10:32.965
and they're getting content
where they are.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.343
Bro, I'm so bored.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.974
You come here, I whack you with this.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.269
Go over there.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.687
I'm so stressed.

10:47.396 --> 10:52.777
I'm not, like, fully okay at all,
and I haven't been in the last year.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.195
I've put in…

10:54.987 --> 10:58.658
ten, twelve hours a day
into this business,

10:58.741 --> 11:00.451
every day for over the last year,

11:00.534 --> 11:03.746
and it's just starting
to catch up and take a toll.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.914
I wish I had help.

11:04.997 --> 11:10.127
I've had so many heart-to-hearts
with people I could rely on a year ago.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.590
I've been like, "Guys, I need your help,
like, I can't do this alone."

11:15.508 --> 11:16.926
And it doesn't change anything.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.681
-That was your flip-flop.
-I know.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.642
Oh my God.

11:24.725 --> 11:28.187
You guys wanna help me
with my Blackwater promo?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.064
-No one wants that.
-Why not?

11:30.147 --> 11:33.192
We live in a content house.
Let's make content.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.528
-Not with you.
-It'll be so funny.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.446
Come on, dude, stop being a puss.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.074
I won't help you,
'cause you won't help me.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.784
Dude, you've never asked me.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.620
'Cause the time I did, you said, "No."

11:45.538 --> 11:48.999
I feel like this is the only time
I actually get to be open about…

11:50.167 --> 11:52.962
how overwhelming this is, for me at least.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.257
It just, like,
is fully on my back to keep it running.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.759
A lot of the time
I feel taken advantage of.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.263
-What do you wanna do?
-We can make pizza blindfolded.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.681
We could make a handshake.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.725
A handshake? What, are you five?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.601
-Yeah.
-That's your idea?

12:07.685 --> 12:09.353
Make a lit-ass handshake.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.772
It all just adds up.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.235
And I just always feel like
I keep adding more and more on my plate.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.406
We need to think of something.
What can we do?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.075
We could…

12:40.926 --> 12:42.928
That was horrible.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.021
Who tinted your windows?

12:52.104 --> 12:53.439
Are you Secret Service?

12:53.522 --> 12:55.357
Why is your window tinted
where I can't see you?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.275
You tinted them.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.736
-You ready to golf?
-No, 'cause like--

12:58.819 --> 13:01.280
Go right there,
I wanna be able to look at your form.

13:04.074 --> 13:04.909
Oh!

13:04.992 --> 13:06.494
We're not a golfing family.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.664
-How are you and Kouvr?
-Good.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.542
-How long have you been together?
-Two and a half years.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.586
-She's ready to get married.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.588
So then, what's stopping you?

13:19.381 --> 13:23.886
I love Kouvr to death, my only issue
is that we rush through everything.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.514
-Because we rushed through our childhood?
-Yes.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.974
Do you not remember this was my dream
when we were kids?

13:29.058 --> 13:29.892
I know.

13:34.188 --> 13:39.360
I have gnarly cars rolling around here,
I've got motorcycles, ATVs, skate ramps.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.279
Not to psychoanalyze myself, but I am.

13:42.363 --> 13:46.283
I never had a real childhood,
so I'm living it the way I dreamed.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.536
When's the last time you saw Mom?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.663
I don't know.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.457
She texted me two weeks ago
cussing me out, though.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.335
Remember, half the time
when she was yelling at you, she's drunk.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.796
It's not on you,
I've been talking to my therapist.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.425
but at the end of the day,
she did this to herself.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.178
Where's your dad now?

14:08.764 --> 14:09.640
Uh…

14:10.432 --> 14:12.893
My dad passed away
when I was nine, to cancer.

14:12.977 --> 14:17.314
Uh, after my father died,
my mom took it hard, started drinking.

14:17.398 --> 14:22.194
There was a lot of things that happened
in that household that was pretty bad.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.076
One day I got kicked out.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.583
I miss Carlsbad, dude.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.627
I can't go to Carlsbad,
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.131
I went down, and I passed our
old neighborhood and I wanted to--

14:42.214 --> 14:43.674
Throw up? I went in--

14:43.757 --> 14:46.510
No, I wanted to drive
the car off the road.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.013
You were 11 when he died? Ten?

14:49.096 --> 14:52.308
Ten. I don't know, I got…
For me, I got really angry.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.475
-Like…
-Yeah.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.312
…I would see other kids with their dads,
and that would piss me off.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.899
I was playing handball and this kid was,
"At least my dad's not dead."

14:59.982 --> 15:00.900
Oh, I remember that.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.694
Punched him straight in the face
and went into the bathroom and cried.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.405
How's the job hunting going?

15:07.114 --> 15:08.574
Uh, it's tough.

15:09.074 --> 15:09.909
It's, like,

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
taking a toll on my mental state.

15:12.786 --> 15:13.954
It's awful.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.709
No one's making fun of you
for not having a job.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.628
-Yeah.
-I don't mind paying your rent.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.339
I don't care.
I will always help you, no matter what.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.466
I know you're trying,
so I'm there to help you.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.929
It's just family. I've helped pay
for my sister's college tuition,

15:30.012 --> 15:32.681
I've given my brother $40,000,

15:32.765 --> 15:34.391
and a car,

15:34.475 --> 15:37.019
and I pay for his rent at his apartment.

15:37.645 --> 15:41.148
There's a lot of pressure with this job,
but my family needs some help,

15:41.231 --> 15:43.400
and I will always help my family members.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.903
-I love you, dude, you're my best friend.
-Yeah.

15:45.986 --> 15:50.532
I just wish you would talk to me more,
I know you keep your emotions to yourself.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.201
-You know?
-Yeah.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.037
And I appreciate that, dude. Come on.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.872
-We're gonna do a cringe hug.
-Oh no.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.083
Oh, yeah, embrace it.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.418
-Why are you taller than me?
-Oh my God, I'm taller!

16:01.502 --> 16:03.253
-Wait. No, no, no.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.298
Let me see. Wait, back, turn your back.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.927
Am I taller? Someone confirm this.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.346
-Who's taller?
-Who's taller?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.099
So that way we can say who's taller.
Point at who's taller.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.477
Just so I can say it.
Who's taller, damn it?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.234
I'm gonna call Tesla
and see if I can buy one.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.485
-Stop it.
-Why?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.487
No, you already pre-ordered one. No.

16:28.570 --> 16:32.116
-I can cancel it and buy one.
-No, put the phone away.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.909
-I'm buying a Tesla.
-You're not buying it.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.911
-I'm bored, I want a Tesla.
-No!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
I can afford another car.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.290
No, you haven't paid taxes yet.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.170
That's not fun.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.965
-I can't bail you out for that.
-It's funny.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.300
'Cause you have to pay taxes?

16:52.261 --> 16:55.806
-Promise you're not gonna buy a car.
-I'm not gonna buy a car.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.392
-Pinky promise me.
-Pinky promise. I'm not.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.728
-I love you.
-I love you too.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.188
I'm looking out for your best interests.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.525
-You see what's happening?
-No.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.777
With, like, all the drama
about my last vlog?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.447
-With the-- Nati?
-The kiss, yeah.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.282
The wedding didn't hit my expectations.

17:13.365 --> 17:17.995
And I've noticed a spike going down
in my views or my subscribers.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.872
I'm not always gonna have a good video

17:19.955 --> 17:23.292
but I kind of get weary
when something doesn't work out.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.252
So I had, like, an idea for a vlog.

17:25.836 --> 17:29.590
Tati, the one "not seeing,"
but seeing Michael,

17:29.673 --> 17:31.842
she has a twin sister, named Nati.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.678
-Yep.
-They're very nice. I care about them.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.973
Both of them wanted
to be part of a prank I put together.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.142
Vinnie kisses Nati,
you're gonna hide in the closet,

17:40.225 --> 17:44.313
and Michael's gonna walk in
thinking Vinnie is kissing his girlfriend.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.272
Great.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.191
-Thumbs up?
-Okay.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.610
Can you come to your room?

17:49.693 --> 17:50.611
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Okay.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.071
Okay.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.328
I feel really bad
'cause last night Nati was crying

18:02.998 --> 18:07.169
And she didn't ask for that,
I hadn't-- Oh my God.

18:07.878 --> 18:11.006
When I posted it,
I made it clear it was a prank.

18:11.090 --> 18:15.886
But a lot of fans were very jealous
and upset at her for kissing Vinnie.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.305
So they started sending her death threats,

18:18.388 --> 18:20.182
And just…

18:20.265 --> 18:23.936
her whole world kind of came down
from a video I made.

18:24.019 --> 18:28.524
I honestly just feel awful for her
because she got really overwhelmed.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.442
I told her not to worry,

18:30.526 --> 18:34.321
but people are in her DMs
telling her to kill herself. It's a lot.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.454
Like, "His lips touched someone else's?
I'll kill them."

18:43.080 --> 18:44.748
What do you expect?

18:44.832 --> 18:48.043
I feel like I can't have
my own personal life.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.712
Let's say I were
to try to get a girlfriend,

18:50.796 --> 18:55.926
if they don't approve of that person,
they'd go into that person's past life,

18:56.009 --> 19:00.514
look at everything about them,
make sure they can find something…

19:06.728 --> 19:09.189
They're gonna wanna leave
'cause they can't handle it.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.317
I don't think it's fair
to lump his entire fan base into it.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.904
You have the normal fans, who are like,
"We love Vinnie." "Vinnie's the best."

19:15.988 --> 19:18.157
Then, you have the radical fans,

19:18.240 --> 19:21.827
who are genuinely convinced
they're going to marry Vinnie.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.414
If they got an opportunity,
would kidnap and hold him in a basement.

19:25.497 --> 19:30.377
Those people that took it to that extent,
I wouldn't call them my fans. 'Cause…

19:31.837 --> 19:34.631
Who in their right mind
would do that?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.888
I don't wanna have to deal with this.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.222
It's terrible.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.184
I had to tweet last night. Listen.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.186
"It's not my fans,
but the girl in my video

19:47.269 --> 19:50.856
doesn't deserve death threats
'cause she chose to be in a prank."

19:50.939 --> 19:54.443
"I never thought
I'd have to ask people not to do that."

19:54.526 --> 19:56.361
It wasn't your fault, Alex, at all.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.447
-How?
-It wasn't!

19:58.530 --> 20:01.366
How? Like, what do you mean?

20:01.992 --> 20:04.578
-All of us didn't know this would happen.
-Right.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.997
It's high school drama,
that's what social media is.

20:07.080 --> 20:07.956
Especially TikTok.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.378
It's just toxic high school.

20:19.134 --> 20:22.012
-Aw!

20:22.095 --> 20:23.222
Dude!

20:29.770 --> 20:33.106
Oh, I'm not gonna end up
doing that thing with Nikita.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.734
-That was a horrible idea.
-That's okay.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.611
-How is that a good idea?
-It's not.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.700
I do feel bad about
not pussy-stunting,

20:43.784 --> 20:45.702
but the whole Nati situation…

20:45.786 --> 20:49.039
I'm at the point where I'm stuck,
people know my every move.

20:49.122 --> 20:52.751
So, maybe I do wanna be low-key
about what I do now.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.755
What should I say to Nikita?
"Hey, I don't wanna do it tomorrow"?

20:56.838 --> 21:00.133
"Hey, it's Vinnie,
I don't wanna do that scene tomorrow."

21:00.217 --> 21:04.179
"I don't wanna get backlash,
I don't wanna be offensive."

21:04.263 --> 21:05.138
Yeah.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.810
Be like, "I wanna avoid controversy,
but if you need anything else."

21:09.893 --> 21:11.979
She loves controversy,
but she'll understand.

21:19.861 --> 21:23.573
-Anybody seen the boxing pads?
-Hello!

21:23.657 --> 21:25.617
-Hi, Nikita.
-Hi, Nikita.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.702
Hi, boys.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.329
-You look amazing.
-Thanks, Alex.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.623
-What are you doing?
-Writing bit ideas.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.208
Should you scratch that

21:33.292 --> 21:36.253
'cause we're about to give you
the biggest bit of your career?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.173
-I told you 1 p.m.
-It's one!

21:40.257 --> 21:42.676
It's 3 p.m.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.761
-It's 2:48.
-Eight.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.431
-Which is 3 p.m.
-That is early for me.

21:47.514 --> 21:51.560
Honey, it's three.
I have to leave at four.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.228
Okay, so we have a whole hour.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.939
I can do you in 30 minutes.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.524
I still have to do stuff here.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.485
-Baby, you give me time, no?
-I can't today, Nikita.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.696
-What do you mean?
-I told you yesterday.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.072
As a friend,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.783
when you tell me to do anything,
when have I ever said no?

22:06.867 --> 22:10.120
I told you one sharp.
I can't do it today, Nikita.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.372
So I'm just supposed to do Vinnie?

22:12.456 --> 22:15.500
-What are you doing?
-I'm just doing his makeup.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.170
You can do my makeup if you want.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.714
-Pat, you would kill it.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.633
I'm not Alex, but I'm the next best thing.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.178
Yeah!

22:27.095 --> 22:29.222
-I'm sorry.
-I'm over it.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.766
All right, Vincenzo.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.851
What is with these flakey-dakeys?

22:32.934 --> 22:35.937
I thought I was supposed to be
the flakiest one here.

22:36.605 --> 22:40.400
I know you texted me yesterday
about not feeling as comfortable.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.069
I don't know, I just feel like,

22:42.152 --> 22:45.572
there might be somebody out there,
if they were to see it,

22:45.655 --> 22:47.657
they'd feel uncomfortable
or something like that.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.160
That might think you're making fun
of the community…

22:50.243 --> 22:52.662
-Yeah.
-…or not taking it serious.

22:53.246 --> 22:57.751
After the Nati and Tati situation,
I wanna be more careful with what I do.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.004
Because, you know,
if I'm not then people get hurt.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.925
And it's like, I just didn't want
to offend the transgender community.

23:05.008 --> 23:08.553
It's a whole bunch of different things
fluttering through your head.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.348
The smallest things
end up being huge for me,

23:11.431 --> 23:14.101
and then all the sudden
everyone's attacking my ass for it.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.228
No, I could see that.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.855
Obviously, for us,
everyone does pick apart

23:18.939 --> 23:20.690
-everything we do and try to cancel us.
-Yeah.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.860
But, from my side,
as someone who represents my community,

23:23.944 --> 23:27.531
I think it's dope someone
who has such a massive platform

23:27.614 --> 23:31.243
is able to express yourself
without making it feel weird.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.329
Again, I would never force that,
but at the same time,

23:34.413 --> 23:38.792
I think anyone from outside looking in,
you shouldn't have that fear. You know?

23:39.793 --> 23:42.421
Mr. Vincenzo should do this pussy-stunt

23:42.504 --> 23:45.090
to get himself out of his own head.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.552
Right now, he is,
like, the hot boy on TikTok.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.303
Expressing himself in this way,

23:50.387 --> 23:53.849
it offers other people
to have the same level of acceptance.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.893
This is proactive,
this is the opposite of canceled.

23:56.977 --> 24:00.105
You're like a pioneer. This is so dope.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.190
I'm obviously a very straight-up person.

24:02.274 --> 24:06.194
I feel like in any moment or whatever,
how I feel, I express it in the moment,

24:06.278 --> 24:07.654
whether that's good or bad.

24:07.737 --> 24:11.032
No, I think it's good.
I just… I have a bad tendency

24:11.116 --> 24:16.621
of not fully expressing and, like,
thinking about things before I say them.

24:16.705 --> 24:20.083
-Yeah.
-You know? Like, that's my bad tendency.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.710
Are you down, like, actually?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.795
-I'm down to do something.
-Okay.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.214
I just didn't want
to do the, like, full, like--

24:26.298 --> 24:27.299
-Yeah.
-You know?

24:27.382 --> 24:30.427
-That's why I said, "Just the tip."
-Like, just the tip.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.850
I do care about Nikita, I mean,
a lot of people have a bad image on her.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.852
Nikita's definitely had it rough.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.062
I can only imagine. I'm not in her shoes.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.483
There's no reason
to hate on somebody for who they are.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.610
It does make me wanna walk in her shoes.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.320
What are you vibing for glam?

24:48.403 --> 24:52.991
I located a size 11 heel for you somehow.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.659
Shall we start? Glam squad!

24:54.743 --> 24:56.953
-Patty!
-Patty!

24:57.037 --> 24:59.498
Time to get my beauty on. Let's go, baby.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.425
What fascinates me about Vinnie
is his presence on social media

25:10.509 --> 25:12.469
has been extremely sexualized,

25:12.552 --> 25:16.264
and I relate to that being a female
who is sexualized.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.058
I like to pick his brain

25:18.141 --> 25:20.268
because he's so confident
in his masculinity,

25:20.352 --> 25:21.394
which I appreciate.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.275
-I used to wear eyeliner a lot.
-Really?

25:27.359 --> 25:28.568
Like, in high school?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.820
No, I went to Catholic school.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.531
-Stop, really?
-Mm-hmm.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.117
High school seems like,
literally, like, a few months ago.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.538
It's been a year.
I had 200k followers on TikTok.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.082
Already? You started TikTok
when you were in high school?

25:42.165 --> 25:42.999
Mm-hmm.

25:43.083 --> 25:48.088
That's crazy, I couldn't imagine
doing social media in high school.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.589
-Like--
-When did you start?

25:49.673 --> 25:52.259
Okay, so I went to school in Virginia.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.637
And at the time,
I was the only one openly gay.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.806
-Yeah.
-I was the only boy on the cheer team.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.977
And my whole life I was just
working towards musical theater.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.604
-Mm-hmm.
-I wanted to be a pop star.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.689
It was my only goal.

26:05.772 --> 26:09.150
And I got a scholarship to NYU
for musical theater.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.696
But then, I just felt like something was,
like, off still.

26:12.779 --> 26:13.738
Yeah.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.324
That's when I was questioning my identity,

26:16.408 --> 26:19.828
so I turned down the scholarship
and started social media

26:19.911 --> 26:22.247
the year after I turned down
my scholarship.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.834
I started documenting everything,
and I blew up when I came to L.A.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.752
That's awesome, I think, like--

26:27.836 --> 26:31.047
-We could learn from each other.
-Yeah, I think we could.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.800
I haven't done boy-glam
in forever.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.635
When was the last time?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.554
Probably when I was a boy.

26:39.055 --> 26:42.100
Such a cutie pie.
You're gonna be a gorgeous girl.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.978
-My work here is done as an artist.
-"My work…"

26:48.857 --> 26:50.859
Okay, come on, follow me.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.365
Okay, now, pussy-stunting
is walking with the confidence

26:57.449 --> 26:59.492
of knowing you have a vagina, right?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.913
-Shall we start?
-Alright. Wait.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.583
Three, two, one, pussy-stunt.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.834
Yeah.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.427
I feel pretty freaking powerful right now.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.263
Yeah.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.806
Suck mine too.

27:22.891 --> 27:26.394
It still kind of lingers in my mind
that I could be canceled for anything.

27:26.478 --> 27:30.106
But the best way to get rid of that
is by just not caring.

27:31.691 --> 27:35.445
There's always people to bring you down.
Just flush it all away and it gets better.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.831
Now, walk back.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.421
Yeah. That was nice.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.383
I'm gonna cry.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.968
-Oh…

28:04.474 --> 28:09.437


28:09.521 --> 28:11.856
-
-<i>Alex broke his foot.</i>

28:11.940 --> 28:13.900


28:13.983 --> 28:16.486
Hold on, I'm gonna come down there.

28:16.569 --> 28:19.030
Can you just pick me up, Calvin?
Leave him there.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.242
This is why I made him
get health insurance.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.159
Idiot.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.454
He's, like,
comatose on the ground.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.499
-He looks like he's dead.
-You know he hates broken bones?

28:30.250 --> 28:32.252
Oh my God, it hurts a lot.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.380
Hi, honey. Okay…

28:35.964 --> 28:36.840
What'd he do?

28:36.923 --> 28:39.592
He went up,
and his foot went backwards.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.887
I'm not gonna push on it,
I'm gonna run my finger over it.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.098
-Can you wiggle your toes?
-No.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.182
Does that hurt?

28:46.266 --> 28:48.476
-I feel-- A little.
-What about this?

28:48.560 --> 28:51.479
-If I pass out at anything--
-No, I know.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.439
I will pass out.

28:52.522 --> 28:56.693
A fracture or a break would turn purple.
It's swollen but it's not black and blue.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.906
It's probably a bad sprain or a tear.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.033
Alex, should I call a medic?

29:04.117 --> 29:05.994
Is there any way you can sit up?

29:06.077 --> 29:07.954
-Yeah, no.
-I know.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.915
I've been in the same exact position
for about 25 minutes.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.960
-Like five, ten minutes.
-I don't know time right now.

29:14.043 --> 29:17.630
All I know is that it hurts a lot.

29:17.714 --> 29:21.843
Dude, I went to the skate park
to blow off steam and I break my foot.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.428
How does this happen to me?

29:23.511 --> 29:25.722
-We're gonna put you in this van.
-Ready?

29:25.805 --> 29:27.348
-One, two, three.
-Go.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.018
Slowly. Over the shoulder.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.853
He's gonna pass out.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.068
-It's only what you want.
-No, it's not.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.029
<i>She was getting death threats.</i>

29:42.238 --> 29:44.949
-Do you have any Advil, Kouvr?
-I have ibuprofen.

29:45.617 --> 29:49.996
I'm not kidding, I've torn my ACL,
my meniscus, I've broken my elbow.

29:50.079 --> 29:52.999
This is probably the worst pain
of all of them.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.835
Did you see my foot, how it happened?

29:55.919 --> 29:57.170
-What did he do?
-Was sideways.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.881
-Did it turn outward or inward?
-I think inward.

30:01.007 --> 30:04.511
He was coming down the ramp and his foot--
I can't even turn it as far.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.679
I can't listen to that.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.015
-Like this? Or that?
-No.

30:09.098 --> 30:13.353
It didn't even go like this,
it literally turned his foot sideways.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.480
-Was it like that? Or this?
-Yeah.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.983
-I think it was like that.
-You guys are killing me!

30:20.318 --> 30:22.362
Alexa, tell me a joke.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.405
<i>How did the banana get out</i>
<i>of jail?</i>

30:24.489 --> 30:25.657
How?

30:25.740 --> 30:27.075
<i> He wins on appeal.</i>

30:30.036 --> 30:33.665
That was good, that was funny.
Okay, I'm good now.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.751
-The medic will be here in five minutes.
-Okay.

30:38.878 --> 30:43.675
I'm worried. When you stop posting
in this line of work, you lose engagement.

30:43.758 --> 30:47.428
You don't get sick days.
If you do, you lose followers,

30:47.512 --> 30:50.390
which is a loss of revenue,
which is your job.

30:50.974 --> 30:54.310
Yeah, doesn't look great,
I'm not gonna lie.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.146
At least you have a reason to relax
for a couple of days.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.232
You think I'm gonna sit here
for a couple of days?

30:59.315 --> 31:00.859
I have to upload tomorrow.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.194
It was bound to happen,
I push myself way too hard.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.112
Okay.

31:04.195 --> 31:08.116
Honey, it's okay,
we can get it done, all right?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.242
How?

31:15.206 --> 31:17.584
Pain is temporary, footage is forever.
