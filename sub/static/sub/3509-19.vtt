WEBVTT

00:03.021 --> 00:04.602
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

00:04.603 --> 00:07.216
the evidence tells us well
beyond a reasonable doubt

00:07.217 --> 00:09.275
that Otis Williams is guilty.

00:09.629 --> 00:13.048
Now he shot and killed Lyla Addison.

00:13.049 --> 00:14.322
And for what?

00:14.323 --> 00:16.758
For her car. Her car.

00:16.759 --> 00:19.941
But that was not the end 
of Mr. Williams' savagery.

00:19.942 --> 00:23.552
He tossed her body into a
trunk and went on a joyride.

00:23.863 --> 00:27.054
Now the defense can make
up any stories they want,

00:27.055 --> 00:29.544
but those stories do not negate the facts.

00:29.545 --> 00:32.247
And the facts are that 
Mr. Williams was caught

00:32.249 --> 00:33.485
in the victim's car,

00:33.486 --> 00:35.314
his fingerprints were all over it,

00:35.315 --> 00:37.567
and her blood was on his clothes.

00:38.731 --> 00:41.454
The true administration of justice

00:41.455 --> 00:43.820
is the firmest foundation

00:43.821 --> 00:45.635
of good government.

00:46.454 --> 00:50.359
Now this should be a challenge
to each and every one of you.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.137
You are the 12 people in this world

00:53.138 --> 00:55.557
that can bring justice to Lyla Addison.

01:02.191 --> 01:03.418
Help me.

01:03.419 --> 01:07.231
Help. 
Excuse me, sir. You can't...

01:07.314 --> 01:08.387
Order.

01:09.350 --> 01:10.679
Order.

01:11.662 --> 01:13.316
Call the paramedics.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.640
Ugh.

01:17.980 --> 01:19.983
Are you trying to kill me? 
What's in this?

01:19.984 --> 01:21.325
Everything you need for a

01:21.326 --> 01:23.635
healthier and longer life.
What is the sense

01:23.636 --> 01:25.492
of living longer if you have to drink that?

01:25.493 --> 01:27.285
Ahh. That's the stuff.

01:27.286 --> 01:28.342
Ugh. Good morning.

01:28.343 --> 01:30.746
Good morning, darling. Hey.
Hey, why aren't you in school?

01:30.747 --> 01:33.970
It's faculty development day. 
Perfect,

01:33.971 --> 01:35.663
because do you know what's
playing at the Angelika?

01:35.664 --> 01:37.909
Hmm.
"Forbidden Planet."

01:37.910 --> 01:39.604
Leslie Nielsen, long
before his comic glory.

01:39.605 --> 01:41.183
You remember how much you used to love this?
Mm-hmm.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.170
Want to go with me?
Sorry, I can't.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.297
I made plans to spend
the day in the Village.

01:45.958 --> 01:47.682
Mm. Delicious. 
Um, bye, grams. Thank you.

01:47.683 --> 01:49.141
Bye, dad.
Bye.

01:49.279 --> 01:50.586
Ahh.

01:52.505 --> 01:54.230
Mother, did you see that? 
Alexis lied.

01:54.231 --> 01:56.540
She did not.
She loves my breakfast smoothies.

01:56.541 --> 01:59.257
No, no, not about that.
About where she's going today.

01:59.258 --> 02:01.578
Her nose crinkled. That's her tell.
Oh, honey, come on.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.520
This is not the World Series of Poker.

02:03.865 --> 02:05.690
I'm telling you, she's up to something. 
Mm.

02:06.663 --> 02:08.068
What about you?
You want to go to the movies?

02:08.068 --> 02:09.591
No can do, kiddo.

02:09.592 --> 02:11.785
Gotta meet with my
contractor at the studio.

02:11.786 --> 02:14.440
Well, then it looks like
I'm going by myself.

02:16.212 --> 02:17.783
Or maybe...

02:18.345 --> 02:19.896
Not at all.

02:20.894 --> 02:23.288
For Richard Castle, press 1.

02:25.412 --> 02:26.657
Hey. 
Hey.

02:26.658 --> 02:28.115
Why were there news vans out front?

02:28.116 --> 02:30.988
Because of who our victim is.
 Joe McUsic.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.216
Who?

02:32.736 --> 02:35.013
Juror number seven in
the Lyla Addison case.

02:35.014 --> 02:36.525
The Addison case, seriously? 
Yeah.

02:36.526 --> 02:39.381
- What happened? - He dropped dead
during the closing argument.

02:39.382 --> 02:40.919
Lanie thinks that he was poisoned.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.605
Heir to the Addison fortune is
murdered, and during the trial

02:43.606 --> 02:45.478
a juror is murdered as well.

02:45.479 --> 02:46.570
This has all the makings

02:46.571 --> 02:48.727
of a John Grisham novel.
What are you doing?

02:48.728 --> 02:52.698
I'm, uh, texting my poker group,
calling dibs on this story.

02:57.463 --> 02:58.813
He was poisoned, all right.

02:58.814 --> 03:00.913
Pink lividity, the smell
of bitter almonds...

03:00.914 --> 03:03.411
Test strip came back positive for cyanide.

03:03.461 --> 03:06.092
Cyanide? That is fantastic.

03:06.983 --> 03:08.965
Unless you're the juror.

03:08.966 --> 03:11.102
There were no puncture marks on the body,

03:11.103 --> 03:12.545
so it was ingested.

03:12.546 --> 03:15.900
That's an odd way to kill.
Not for Nazis or evil dictators.

03:16.372 --> 03:17.634
How did he ingest it?

03:17.635 --> 03:20.471
Brownish stains in his mouth
indicate he recently had coffee.

03:20.472 --> 03:21.766
Maybe it was in there.

03:21.767 --> 03:24.540
After he consumed e poison,
how long before he died?

03:24.541 --> 03:25.907
No more than 15 minutes.

03:25.908 --> 03:27.119
According to the court clerk,

03:27.120 --> 03:29.795
Mr. McUsic arrived this morning at 8:37

03:29.796 --> 03:32.080
and died at approximately 9:13.

03:32.081 --> 03:32.886
15 minutes.

03:32.887 --> 03:35.305
That means that he was
poisoned at the courthouse.

03:35.306 --> 03:39.480
Mm-hmm. And who benefits from a dead juror?
The defendant.

03:39.968 --> 03:41.374
Then we agree.

03:41.584 --> 03:43.651
The defendant, Otis Williams.

03:43.652 --> 03:45.746
This guy's a real dirtbag's dirtbag.

03:45.747 --> 03:48.633
Grand theft auto, aggravated
assault, attempted murder.

03:48.634 --> 03:51.134
Dirtbag trifecta, which
means, if convicted,

03:51.135 --> 03:53.546
he'd go away for a long time.
Life without parole.

03:53.547 --> 03:55.173
I bet the D.A. would ask for the needle

03:55.174 --> 03:56.508
if New York still had the death penalty.

03:56.509 --> 03:57.640
They caught him in the stolen car

03:57.641 --> 03:59.432
with Lyla Addison's body in the trunk.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.374
They got his fingerprints,
traces of the victim's blood.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.031
This guy's way past guilty.

04:03.032 --> 04:06.531
So this is jury intimidation at its finest.

04:06.532 --> 04:09.255
You kill a juror, you not
only guarantee a mistrial,

04:09.256 --> 04:09.945
but it also serves

04:09.946 --> 04:12.261
as a warning for any future
jurors on a retrial.

04:12.262 --> 04:13.344
I mean, who wants to serve on a jury

04:13.345 --> 04:14.546
if there's a chance of being killed?

04:14.547 --> 04:16.555
But we know Otis didn't do it.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.492
He's been incarcerated since his arrest.

04:18.493 --> 04:20.031
He might have had an accomplice.

04:20.031 --> 04:23.439
Whoever poisoned Joe McUsic
somehow did it in this building

04:23.440 --> 04:25.329
15 minutes before he died.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.219
I'll get with security, pull
the surveillance footage

04:27.220 --> 04:28.907
from all the corridors and common rooms.

04:28.908 --> 04:31.288
I'll talk to the jurors.
Someone might have seen something.

04:31.289 --> 04:32.003
All right.

04:35.399 --> 04:36.042
Why don't we see

04:36.043 --> 04:38.010
what Mr. Otis Williams
has to say for himself?

04:41.712 --> 04:43.285
Counselor.

04:43.286 --> 04:44.567
Detective Beckett.

04:44.568 --> 04:45.848
I'd like to speak with your client.

04:45.849 --> 04:47.427
Detective, anything we have
to say about Lyla Addison,

04:47.428 --> 04:49.832
we've said during the trial.
I'm not here about Ms. Addison.

04:49.833 --> 04:53.042
I'm here about juror number seven.
Okay.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.313
He was murdered.
Murdered?

04:55.314 --> 04:58.766
I thought he died of a seizure
or some other natural cause.

04:58.767 --> 05:01.110
There's nothing natural
about cyanide poisoning.

05:01.111 --> 05:03.354
Okay, look, my client doesn't
know anything about that,

05:03.355 --> 05:04.948
and there's no way I'm
letting him talk to you.

05:04.949 --> 05:06.670
Now if you'll excuse us,
we're due in court.

05:06.671 --> 05:07.591
Let's go.

05:11.290 --> 05:13.122
In light of the shocking circumstances

05:13.123 --> 05:15.635
of juror number seven's
death, it is my belief

05:15.636 --> 05:16.835
that this particular jury

05:16.836 --> 05:19.518
is no longer capable of
reaching a fair verdict.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.094
Therefore, I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

05:22.095 --> 05:25.304
- Uh, your honor, the people 
intend to refile charges. - Noted.

05:25.649 --> 05:27.948
Until then, Mr. Williams will be remanded.

05:28.306 --> 05:29.843
This hearing is adjourned.

05:30.725 --> 05:32.965
You call this justice, your honor?

05:33.318 --> 05:35.279
After what he did to my daughter?

05:37.320 --> 05:38.236
You... monster.

05:38.237 --> 05:41.020
Dad! Dad, no.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.745
Let's go home.

05:47.941 --> 05:51.090
Looks like Otis' plan is working.
Yeah, for now.

05:52.906 --> 05:54.237
Ryan, you find anything yet?

05:54.238 --> 05:56.727
Not yet. That building
has a lot of cameras.

05:56.785 --> 05:59.300
Even though we have a very
narrow time frame, it's gonna

05:59.301 --> 06:00.514
take a couple of hours to
get through all of it.

06:00.515 --> 06:01.968
Maybe we're wrong about the defendant.

06:01.969 --> 06:04.406
Maybe we should be looking at a juror.
What do you mean?

06:04.407 --> 06:06.587
Tony Muller. Juror number four.

06:07.081 --> 06:08.880
He's been missing since the murder.

06:08.881 --> 06:10.667
He was a no-show for one of our interviews.

06:10.668 --> 06:12.364
He's not answering his cell.
Neighbors saw him

06:12.365 --> 06:13.835
leave his apartment with an overnight bag.

06:13.836 --> 06:15.332
All right, keep an eye out
for him on the video.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.242
I already got an A.P.B. out on him.
Oh, you do?

06:17.243 --> 06:18.526
Mm-hmm. 
Good.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.191
Beckett.

06:20.843 --> 06:22.569
The brother of your dead juror's here.

06:25.509 --> 06:27.596
I thought courtrooms were
supposed to be safe.

06:27.796 --> 06:29.397
I'm so sorry, Mr. McUsic.

06:29.398 --> 06:31.550
We're doing everything
we can to figure it out.

06:31.551 --> 06:33.325
But who would want to hurt Joe? 
Well,

06:33.326 --> 06:35.170
you know, it might not have
to do with your brother.

06:35.503 --> 06:38.209
It might have to do with the
jury that he served on.

06:38.415 --> 06:40.936
Did you know that he was
assigned the Addison trial?

06:40.937 --> 06:41.864
No.

06:42.413 --> 06:44.648
No. I just knew he had jury duty.

06:45.652 --> 06:48.025
Can you think of any reasons why
your brother might have been

06:48.026 --> 06:50.871
biased either toward or
against the defendant?

06:52.229 --> 06:53.519
When he was a kid,

06:53.685 --> 06:55.944
my brother had a few scrapes with the law.

06:57.555 --> 06:59.470
But he cleaned his life up.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.183
He believed in second chances.

07:02.794 --> 07:04.786
That's why he ran the halfway house.

07:06.064 --> 07:08.613
What he didn't believe in were
third, fourth, fifth chances.

07:08.614 --> 07:09.731
He'd been out there long enough to know,

07:09.732 --> 07:11.855
some folks can't be rehabilitated.

07:15.583 --> 07:16.512
Do you know if your brother

07:16.513 --> 07:18.493
had any problems with anyone at work?

07:18.494 --> 07:21.021
I mean, given the kinds of
people that he dealt with...

07:21.312 --> 07:24.537
No. Joe had a way with folks.

07:25.726 --> 07:27.632
He'd look out for people.

07:33.937 --> 07:35.870
You think Joe was chosen at random,

07:35.871 --> 07:37.763
or do you think he was killed
because of his background?

07:37.764 --> 07:39.864
Well, since this isn't,
in fact, a Grisham novel,

07:39.865 --> 07:41.496
I thought I'd keep an open mind.

07:41.497 --> 07:44.323
Hey, Ryan. Can you look into
Joe McUsic's halfway house,

07:44.324 --> 07:45.708
see if he had problems with anyone there?

07:45.709 --> 07:46.823
I already spoke with the staff.

07:46.824 --> 07:47.889
They don't remember any conflicts,

07:47.890 --> 07:48.747
but they're sending over a

07:48.748 --> 07:51.404
list of residents in case.
Yo. Our missing juror?

07:51.405 --> 07:53.536
Troopers picked him up crossing 
the G.W. bridge.

07:53.537 --> 07:54.837
They're bringing him in now.

07:56.454 --> 07:58.668
You were leaving town in a hurry,
Mr. Muller.

07:58.669 --> 08:00.711
Any reason why?
Isn't it obvious?

08:00.712 --> 08:02.467
I'm marked for death, man.

08:02.873 --> 08:03.887
Marked for death?

08:03.888 --> 08:06.241
I didn't ask for jury duty.
I was summoned.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.694
They said show up at
this time at this place.

08:08.695 --> 08:10.638
They failed to mention that
the defendant's homeboy

08:10.639 --> 08:13.627
was gonna kill me. 
The defendant's homeboy?

08:13.628 --> 08:16.079
Yeah. This big scary black guy.

08:16.222 --> 08:18.764
Exactly what happened, Mr. Muller?

08:19.255 --> 08:22.113
Yesterday, this guy follows me
into the courthouse bathroom

08:22.114 --> 08:24.500
and starts chatting me up about the trial.

08:24.501 --> 08:26.237
Did he give you his name? 
No, no.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.832
But he's going on and on about
how Otis Williams is innocent

08:29.024 --> 08:31.038
and how he's being
railroaded by the system.

08:31.039 --> 08:34.279
And then this morning, I see the same guy

08:34.280 --> 08:35.818
on the defendant's side of the gallery

08:35.820 --> 08:38.505
in the front row, eyeballing me.

08:38.506 --> 08:40.423
Have you ever seen him with Joe?

08:40.424 --> 08:43.197
Yes, which is why when I saw Joe bite it

08:43.198 --> 08:45.600
right in front of me, I knew I was next.

08:45.601 --> 08:47.028
And why should I die?

08:47.283 --> 08:49.976
I was only trying to fulfill
my civic responsibilities.

08:52.968 --> 08:55.256
Thank you for coming in, 
Mr. Muller.

08:55.257 --> 08:57.094
Now do you think you'll
be able to describe him

08:57.095 --> 08:58.229
to our sketch artist?

08:58.230 --> 09:00.135
He... he's a big scary black guy.

09:00.136 --> 09:02.553
It might help if you're just
a little more specific.

09:02.554 --> 09:04.596
Uh, okay. Uh...

09:04.597 --> 09:06.482
Well, like I said, he's a...

09:06.483 --> 09:09.101
He's a big scary black guy

09:10.242 --> 09:12.562
named Wardell Williams.

09:12.563 --> 09:14.504
The defendant's cousin.

09:14.505 --> 09:16.392
I didn't... I thought you
didn't know who he was.

09:16.393 --> 09:18.148
I didn't, but there he is.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.426
Well, a-are you sure? 
Yeah.

09:25.427 --> 09:27.722
- Why? - While you guys were in
the box with Mr. Muller,

09:27.723 --> 09:29.632
I-I found this on courthouse surveillance.

09:31.443 --> 09:33.797
See, that's Joe the juror
at the coffee machine

09:33.798 --> 09:37.287
roughly 14 minutes before his
death, right in our kill zone.

09:39.514 --> 09:41.847
Cousin Wardell. 
And watch this.

09:47.249 --> 09:49.478
Looks like he makes a killer cup of joe.

09:52.054 --> 09:53.277
Too soon?

09:55.054 --> 09:59.277

10:10.259 --> 10:11.631
Now y'all trying to accuse me of murder

10:11.632 --> 10:14.173
with this half-assed version
of a Zapruder film?

10:14.174 --> 10:16.466
You and Otis were more than just cousins.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.242
Grew up in the same household.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.724
More like brothers.

10:20.039 --> 10:21.806
Yeah, me and O. tight.
So what?

10:21.807 --> 10:23.747
So it makes sense you'd do anything him,

10:23.748 --> 10:27.752
including kill a juror on his murder trial.
Man, y'all reaching.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.107
Are we?

10:29.561 --> 10:32.331
You talked to jurors.
That's jury tampering.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.747
So accusing one black man of
a murder he didn't commit

10:34.748 --> 10:37.229
isn't good enough for you?
Y'all trying for the daily double?

10:37.817 --> 10:40.141
Man, I talked to a gang of
folks in that courthouse.

10:40.142 --> 10:42.099
How I'm supposed to know which
one of them is a juror?

10:42.414 --> 10:44.192
Well, the "juror" badges on their shirts

10:44.193 --> 10:47.187
might have been a hint.
Using video surveillance footage

10:47.188 --> 10:50.883
C.S.U. managed to pull Joe's
coffee cup out of the garbage.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.961
They're testing it for cyanide.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.529
Why don't you just come clean

10:54.530 --> 10:55.879
while we still got a deal to make?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.575
Man, I told you, I didn't do nothin'!

10:57.576 --> 11:00.768
Wardell, sit down before
I make you sit down.

11:05.136 --> 11:07.382
So obviously, you must be the bad cop.

11:07.624 --> 11:09.478
Guess that makes you the good cop.

11:09.479 --> 11:10.950
Actually, I'm not a cop.

11:10.951 --> 11:14.136
Oh, you not a cop? 
Mr. Castle is a writer.

11:14.442 --> 11:16.658
He consults with the
department on occasion.

11:16.891 --> 11:19.379
Oh. So that's how you two do it?

11:19.723 --> 11:22.026
You tell the lies, you print the lies?

11:22.027 --> 11:24.602
Man, y'all framing me just
like they did my cousin.

11:24.603 --> 11:27.378
Man, this whole damn thing a conspiracy.
Wardell, be serious.

11:27.379 --> 11:28.985
You don't think I'm serious?

11:29.867 --> 11:32.115
Then tell me, why of all
the lawyers in the city,

11:32.116 --> 11:35.000
the district attorney is trying Otis' case?

11:35.218 --> 11:36.949
You don't think it's 'cause
he's running for Mayor

11:36.950 --> 11:38.115
and he wants to lock my cousin up

11:38.116 --> 11:40.458
so all his rich, powerful
white friends can feel safe?

11:40.927 --> 11:43.796
Look, you're not doing
yourself any favors right now.

11:43.797 --> 11:45.665
You just got it all worked out, huh?

11:45.839 --> 11:48.734
You got my cousin O.
pulling a bigger Thomas.

11:48.735 --> 11:51.144
And you got me poisoning
this man to get him off.

11:52.695 --> 11:54.095
Looks that way.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.111
Well, looks don't make it so.

11:57.602 --> 11:59.782
Looks like I'm poisoning
this man's coffee...

12:01.918 --> 12:04.479
When really, all I did was hand it to him.

12:06.256 --> 12:07.610
Hey, Esposito. 
Hmm?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.389
Can you get a warrant for Wardell's place,

12:09.390 --> 12:11.587
see if there's any traces of cyanide?
You got it.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.801
And as they say in legalese,
asked and answered.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.439
It's too bad.
I was hoping there'd be a little more

12:16.440 --> 12:17.853
to the story than that.

12:19.411 --> 12:20.276
Hmm.

12:20.451 --> 12:22.037
"Hmm," what?

12:22.038 --> 12:23.393
Alexis said she'd be in the Village today,

12:23.394 --> 12:25.015
but she's over in Williamsburg.

12:25.217 --> 12:26.701
Well, how do you know
she's in Williamsburg?

12:26.702 --> 12:28.245
GPS tracked her phone.

12:28.743 --> 12:30.151
You tracked her phone?

12:30.203 --> 12:32.560
Yeah. Super cool app I just downloaded.

12:32.561 --> 12:34.768
I can see where she is at anytime.

12:35.141 --> 12:36.807
Does she know that you're doing this?

12:38.715 --> 12:40.565
What, are you kidding? 
No, she'd kill me.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.588
And be justified.

12:42.589 --> 12:44.414
I'm her father.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.046
If something's going on, I-I need to know.

12:46.047 --> 12:46.737
A lot of parents

12:46.738 --> 12:49.191
will go through their kids'
drawers or computers.

12:49.521 --> 12:51.142
Far less intrusive.

12:55.198 --> 12:56.625
Beckett.

12:56.958 --> 12:58.944
Joe's cyanide-laced coffee cup.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.656
C.S.U. found both Joe and
Wardell's prints on it,

13:01.657 --> 13:03.806
but there was something
very important missing.

13:03.807 --> 13:05.139
Cyanide.

13:05.140 --> 13:06.762
Really? 
Really.

13:06.763 --> 13:08.639
Well, how was he poisoned?

13:08.640 --> 13:11.314
During the autopsy, I
discovered cyanide residue

13:11.315 --> 13:13.199
in a prescription time-release capsule.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.992
So Joe had a prescription for cyanide?

13:15.993 --> 13:19.490
No. He had a prescription
for corticosteroids.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.810
According to his physician,
he took one every morning

13:21.811 --> 13:23.502
for symptoms from lupus.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.451
It looks like the killer

13:24.452 --> 13:26.279
switched out the contents of Joe's capsule

13:26.280 --> 13:28.320
and replaced it with the cyanide.

13:28.321 --> 13:30.548
Okay, so then when Joe was
taking his medications,

13:30.549 --> 13:33.836
he unknowingly poisoned himself.
But here's the rub...

13:33.837 --> 13:36.126
Since the cyanide was in
a time-release capsule

13:36.127 --> 13:38.722
designed not to dissolve in stomach acid,

13:38.723 --> 13:40.993
but in the intestines...
our timeline is all screwed up.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.740
Uh-huh. 
Yep, turns out Joe

13:42.741 --> 13:44.774
was poisoned almost one
hour before his death

13:44.775 --> 13:47.686
13 this morning. That's before
he even got to the courthouse.

13:47.687 --> 13:49.569
Which means the killer
probably wasn't there either.

13:49.570 --> 13:52.076
Then Joe's death might not have
anything to do with the trial.

13:52.077 --> 13:53.834
Well, we learned three
very important things.

13:53.835 --> 13:56.145
Firstly, our killer is diabolical.

13:56.146 --> 13:58.385
You let someone unwittingly
kill themselves?

13:58.386 --> 13:59.308
Pure evil.

13:59.309 --> 14:02.150
Second, our killer knew Joe
or at least knew his habits.

14:02.151 --> 14:04.275
Third, our killer was a woman. 
Hmm?

14:04.276 --> 14:06.739
Statistically speaking,
poisonings are almost always

14:06.740 --> 14:09.322
carried out by the fairer sex.
Ah, but you are missing

14:09.323 --> 14:12.178
one very important detail, Castle.
Enlighten me.

14:12.179 --> 14:14.460
Our killer had access to Joe's medications,

14:14.461 --> 14:16.378
medications that he did not keep on him.

14:16.379 --> 14:19.121
So therefore our killer had
access to... his apartment.

14:19.122 --> 14:20.077
Bingo.

14:20.908 --> 14:22.467
NYPD.

14:24.838 --> 14:26.682
You know, the murder of Joe the juror

14:26.683 --> 14:27.971
is a real tragedy.

14:27.972 --> 14:29.582
Isn't every murder a tragedy?

14:29.583 --> 14:32.155
Yes, every murder's a tragedy,
but Joe is special.

14:32.598 --> 14:35.247
He was a juvenile delinquent
who reformed himself,

14:35.914 --> 14:37.587
a born-again citizen

14:37.732 --> 14:41.036
who believed in the system
and helped out ex-cons.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.677
And what did he get for his trouble?

14:44.601 --> 14:46.748
Hmm. 
Pill full of poison.

14:46.749 --> 14:47.479
Mm-hmm.

14:48.438 --> 14:50.546
"Cowards die many times before their death.

14:50.547 --> 14:53.391
The valiant never taste of death but once."

14:54.498 --> 14:55.839
Bro, you're not Castle.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.688
Yeah, I know I'm not Castle.
Then stop trying to talk like him.

14:59.664 --> 15:02.251
What, I'm not allowed
to reference the bard?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.118
I'm a Renaissance man.

15:07.119 --> 15:09.699
Memorizing one quote does not
make you a Renaissance man.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.357
What if I memorized two?

15:11.358 --> 15:13.159
Have you memorized two?

15:13.160 --> 15:14.581
No, but what if I did?

15:16.572 --> 15:17.617
Depends on the quote.

15:18.008 --> 15:19.946
Ah!

15:22.423 --> 15:23.915
Now who the hell are you?

15:25.131 --> 15:26.483
Hank Ponzell,

15:26.484 --> 15:29.568
former resident of Joe
McUsic's halfway house,

15:29.569 --> 15:33.065
until you were kicked out when
Joe denied your extension.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.636
That had to make you mad, huh, Hank?
You don't understand.

15:35.637 --> 15:38.945
Oh, no. I think we do.
Joe kicked you to the curb,

15:38.946 --> 15:39.943
and you poisoned him.

15:39.944 --> 15:41.965
Lab report shows that every
one of these capsules

15:41.966 --> 15:43.877
tested positive for cyanide.
If I poisoned him,

15:44.126 --> 15:45.732
why would I still be in his apartment?

15:45.733 --> 15:47.669
To take the rest of the poisoned pills away

15:47.670 --> 15:50.156
so we couldn't find them, so
you could hide your tracks.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.395
I was out of the apartment all day.

15:51.396 --> 15:54.861
Anyone could've gotten in there.
And I would never hurt Joe.

15:56.349 --> 15:57.824
He was my friend.

15:57.825 --> 15:59.109
Friends like him, huh? 
Right?

15:59.110 --> 16:02.116
I didn't poison him.
Joe was letting me stay there, okay?

16:02.325 --> 16:04.225
I maxed out my time at the halfway house

16:04.226 --> 16:05.409
and didn't have a place to go.

16:05.410 --> 16:08.402
Joe broke the rules and
let me crash with him.

16:08.686 --> 16:11.064
Then why were you playing
hide-and-go-seek in his closet?

16:11.065 --> 16:12.513
I'm a felon on parole.

16:12.950 --> 16:15.278
I hear cops, and my
ex-con instincts kick in.

16:15.279 --> 16:18.334
Okay, if you were there on the up-and-up,

16:18.335 --> 16:21.084
tell us, was Joe in any kind of trouble?

16:24.943 --> 16:26.092
Look, buddy,

16:26.439 --> 16:28.911
I don't think you appreciate
the situation you're in.

16:28.912 --> 16:30.569
You are on parole,

16:30.570 --> 16:33.420
and you're up to your neck
in a homicide investigation.

16:33.421 --> 16:35.854
Now you better start talking,
or we're gonna have you

16:35.855 --> 16:37.701
back in Sing Sing before
the evening roll call.

16:37.702 --> 16:40.681
All right. Joe had me run
errands for him, okay?

16:41.075 --> 16:43.503
Pick up laundry, go to the
bodega, stuff like that.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.087
A few weeks ago, he gave me an envelope

16:45.088 --> 16:47.377
and told me to take it to this lady.
What was in the envelope?

16:47.378 --> 16:51.160
Cash. Like 2 grand.
But I don't know what it was for. I swear.

16:51.161 --> 16:53.666
Joe always talked about how he
got out of the criminal life,

16:53.667 --> 16:55.236
but maybe he still had a foot in.

16:56.608 --> 16:59.013
Who was this lady that you
delivered the envelope to?

17:01.030 --> 17:02.380
Ms. Jenkins?

17:03.092 --> 17:04.186
Yes.

17:06.188 --> 17:08.846
Do you live at 3751 West End Ave.?

17:09.205 --> 17:11.375
Yes. 
We need to chat.

17:11.376 --> 17:14.983
I did it. I did it. I did it. 
You killed him?

17:14.984 --> 17:16.816
Oh, my God, no. Of course not.

17:16.817 --> 17:19.406
Why would you think that?
Because you just said "I did it."

17:19.407 --> 17:22.166
Oh, no, no, not murder. 
No, God.

17:22.167 --> 17:25.003
I-I did something else.
Something... awful.

17:25.167 --> 17:26.632
Ms. Jenkins, you're the court clerk.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.739
Why did Joe McUsic give
you that much money?

17:29.091 --> 17:31.791
He paid me to put him on that jury.

17:40.444 --> 17:41.845
Joe McUsic came to me

17:41.846 --> 17:44.331
and said he wanted to serve his jury duty.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.913
I didn't see the harm.

17:46.022 --> 17:48.531
Sure. I mean, especially if
you're gonna make a profit.

17:48.532 --> 17:50.773
My roommate moved out two months ago.

17:50.774 --> 17:53.114
I needed the extra cash
for rent, and I figured,

17:53.115 --> 17:56.327
who's gonna know?
I mean, it's jury duty.

17:56.605 --> 17:59.405
Please, please, don't send me to prison.

17:59.406 --> 18:02.233
All day long, I-I see the
women who get sent there,

18:02.234 --> 18:04.493
and... I can't hack it.

18:04.494 --> 18:07.380
I'll be some lifer's
bitch before breakfast.

18:07.381 --> 18:10.206
Okay, Joe specifically asked

18:10.207 --> 18:12.323
to be on Otis Williams' trial?

18:12.377 --> 18:15.609
Yes. He was insistent about
getting on that jury pool.

18:15.610 --> 18:16.782
Did he tell you why?

18:16.783 --> 18:19.047
No, but it was the Lyla Addison case,

18:19.097 --> 18:20.621
so I figured maybe he wanted to write

18:20.622 --> 18:22.799
a tell-all book about it or something.

18:23.121 --> 18:26.455
I-I swear, all I did was
put him in the pool.

18:26.456 --> 18:28.605
He got through jury selection on his own.

18:28.606 --> 18:30.542
Ryan and Esposito looked at Joe's computer.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.217
There's no evidence that
he was writing a book

18:32.295 --> 18:33.653
or even taking notes on the trial.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.800
So a murdered juror just
bought himself on to the jury,

18:35.801 --> 18:37.465
and we still have no idea why?

18:37.709 --> 18:39.155
A murder, a mystery,

18:39.156 --> 18:41.327
wrapped up inside a courtroom thriller...

18:41.374 --> 18:43.274
I can't believe John Grisham
hasn't written this book.

18:43.275 --> 18:44.444
I wish he had, maybe then we'd know

18:44.445 --> 18:46.332
what was so special about
that trial to Joe.

18:46.602 --> 18:48.938
Well, maybe Joe had a personal
connection to the trial...

18:48.985 --> 18:50.780
to the victim, Lyla Addison,

18:50.828 --> 18:52.710
or to the defendant, Otis Williams.

18:52.711 --> 18:53.912
Doesn't Joe have a juvie record?

18:53.913 --> 18:55.770
Mm-hmm. What if he knew
Otis from back in the day?

18:55.771 --> 18:57.802
They could've gotten arrested
together or maybe spent

18:57.803 --> 18:59.031
some time in the same juvenile hall.

18:59.032 --> 19:00.470
That's a good idea. I'll look into it.

19:00.471 --> 19:01.841
Meanwhile, I'll have
Lyla Addison's case file

19:01.842 --> 19:04.267
sent over from the 7-4,
and you should check in

19:04.268 --> 19:05.623
with the family.
Could be a connection there.

19:05.624 --> 19:06.765
Okay. Good night, Castle.

19:06.766 --> 19:07.669
Night.

19:20.453 --> 19:22.012
Hey, dad. Writing?

19:22.013 --> 19:24.051
Yeah. How was your day?

19:24.052 --> 19:25.578
Did you have a good time in the Village?

19:25.579 --> 19:27.793
Yeah. 
Go anywhere else?

19:28.403 --> 19:30.712
Uh, no. Just stayed in the Village.

19:32.918 --> 19:33.969
Really?

19:34.923 --> 19:37.513
I mean, New York is a big city.

19:38.029 --> 19:39.248
Lots of boroughs.

19:39.249 --> 19:41.577
Yeah, but I just stayed in Manhattan.

19:41.976 --> 19:45.517
So you didn't go to, uh... Brooklyn?

19:45.518 --> 19:47.794
Williamsburg is beautiful
this time of year.

19:49.744 --> 19:51.252
How did you know?

19:51.363 --> 19:53.882
A friend of mine told me.
He went there. He saw you.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.320
What friend?

19:55.321 --> 19:58.657
A close friend. J.J... Adams.

19:58.658 --> 20:00.746
Nose twitch. That's your tell.
You're lying.

20:00.813 --> 20:02.830
No, I'm not. 
Then who is J.J. Adams?

20:02.831 --> 20:04.636
He's a friend of mine.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.309
Wait. J.J. Adams was Leslie
Nielsen's character name

20:08.310 --> 20:10.291
in "Forbidden Planet." 
You're totally lying.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.936
How did you know where I was?
Are you having me followed?

20:12.937 --> 20:17.322
Monitoring my metro card?
Checking my credit... my phone.

20:18.580 --> 20:19.936
Dad, tell me you are not tracking my phone.

20:19.937 --> 20:21.484
Okay, look, this is not about what I did.

20:21.485 --> 20:23.075
It's about what you did. 
You lied to me.

20:23.076 --> 20:25.076
Says the man who violated his
daughter's civil rights.

20:25.077 --> 20:26.741
Okay, technically, I would
have to be the government

20:26.742 --> 20:28.475
to violate...
You're tracking my every move.

20:28.476 --> 20:31.274
Not your every move.
Welcome to George Orwell's "1984,"

20:31.275 --> 20:33.185
with my father as Big Brother.
This isn't about...

20:33.186 --> 20:35.088
What's next, a chip in my brain?

20:35.549 --> 20:38.225
Whatever it takes when you're
keeping secrets from me.

20:38.226 --> 20:40.407
You know what? If you're so
interested in what I'm doing,

20:40.408 --> 20:41.648
why don't you ask your phone?

20:41.649 --> 20:43.233
I'm sure there's an app for that.

20:48.567 --> 20:49.780
You had it coming, Castle.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.867
I mean, you have the best kid in the world,

20:51.868 --> 20:55.260
and you treated her like a common criminal.
Maybe she is, though.

20:55.349 --> 20:56.647
I still don't know why she lied about

20:56.648 --> 20:58.472
going to Williamsburg.
And you probably never will,

20:58.817 --> 21:00.642
unless you plan on waterboarding her.

21:00.849 --> 21:02.608
Honestly, is what I did so wrong?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.784
I don't really think that
it matters to Alexis.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.713
I mean, you broke her trust.

21:07.314 --> 21:08.912
Yeah, I know.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.126
So what do I do now?

21:11.127 --> 21:12.328
Win it back.

21:13.088 --> 21:14.752
Come on. Lyla's family's waiting.

21:18.091 --> 21:20.347
No, I've never seen him
outside the jury box.

21:20.632 --> 21:21.655
Don't think any of us have.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.616
Well, a juror bribing his way onto a trial?

21:25.372 --> 21:28.024
I've never in my 25 years as a prosecutor

21:28.025 --> 21:29.928
seen anything like it. 
Mr. Addison,

21:29.929 --> 21:32.456
is it at all possible that
your daughter knew this man?

21:33.082 --> 21:34.024
No.

21:35.225 --> 21:36.411
Stephen?

21:37.639 --> 21:39.453
I know most of my sister's friends.

21:39.977 --> 21:41.208
He's not one of 'em.

21:41.728 --> 21:43.585
And if he was, why would he have done this?

21:44.061 --> 21:46.236
Why would he put my sister's
shot at justice in jeopardy?

21:51.057 --> 21:52.832
Roy, I don't think I need to tell you

21:52.833 --> 21:55.873
how catastrophic this could
be to the city's legal system

21:55.948 --> 21:58.383
now I need Joe McUsic's murder solved.

21:58.384 --> 22:01.247
How bad are things, Lou? 
It's pretty bad.

22:01.597 --> 22:04.365
Just this morning at voir dire, 
I had potential jurors

22:04.366 --> 22:07.180
expressing fears for their
own personal safety.

22:07.361 --> 22:09.640
Now the people of New York
need to be assured

22:09.641 --> 22:11.000
that they are protected.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.049
Keep me in the loop.

22:17.524 --> 22:19.155
In all the years I've been in command

22:19.156 --> 22:21.792
of the 12th precinct,
you know how many times

22:21.793 --> 22:23.308
the district attorney has shown up?

22:23.486 --> 22:25.870
Once. Today.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.673
You heard the man. Let's get to work. 
Yes, sir.

22:33.764 --> 22:36.562
There is no Joe connection to Lyla Addison.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.028
There's nothing in her financials,

22:38.029 --> 22:40.111
her murder file, her e-mails, her texts,

22:40.112 --> 22:41.420
not even her yearbook.

22:41.421 --> 22:44.637
Joe and Lyla have absolutely
nothing in common.

22:44.638 --> 22:45.796
It's like the two of them didn't even

22:45.797 --> 22:48.688
live on the same planet.
Same goes with Joe and Otis.

22:48.689 --> 22:51.761
There's no Joe connection in the juvie files?
No, not even close.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.583
Joe and Otis were sent
to different juvie halls

22:53.584 --> 22:55.776
at different times, and they
ran in opposite neighborhoods.

22:55.777 --> 22:56.972
So then why the hell did he want to get

22:56.973 --> 22:59.808
on that jury so bad?
Wait a minute I think I got something.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.025
You have a connection?

23:01.135 --> 23:02.912
According to his credit card, Joe purchased

23:02.913 --> 23:05.614
a pay-as-you-go cell phone
from an electronics store

23:05.615 --> 23:07.072
a couple of months back.

23:07.688 --> 23:09.263
So?
So he already had a cell phone.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.643
What's he need a burner phone for,

23:10.644 --> 23:13.003
especially an anonymous one?

23:13.004 --> 23:14.579
And if he is using it, where is it?

23:14.580 --> 23:15.728
All right, take a crew to his apartment,

23:15.729 --> 23:17.137
see what you can find.

23:17.745 --> 23:19.641
That might be the break that we need. 
Yeah.

23:21.352 --> 23:24.280
Castle? Castle, can you
stop playing around?

23:24.644 --> 23:25.660
Actually, I'm not playing around.

23:25.661 --> 23:27.980
I'm a little busy blowing
this case wide open.

23:28.094 --> 23:30.841
This is a photograph of the looky loos

23:30.842 --> 23:32.187
at Lyla's crime scene.

23:32.188 --> 23:34.237
This is a little magnification app.

23:34.621 --> 23:35.948
Recognize anyone?

23:42.796 --> 23:43.908
It's Joe.

23:43.909 --> 23:46.629
He was at Lyla Addison's crime scene.

23:48.096 --> 23:50.692
Why would he be there?
Only three reasons for a civilian

23:50.693 --> 23:53.335
to be at a murder scene...
One, they're dead,

23:53.336 --> 23:56.300
two, they just happen to
be in the immediate area,

23:56.301 --> 23:58.755
or three, it's our killer,
and he couldn't resist

23:58.756 --> 24:00.776
the compulsion to return
to the scene of the crime.

24:00.777 --> 24:03.751
And which number do you think Joe is?
I'm gonna go with three.

24:03.752 --> 24:06.134
He's our victim and our killer. 
Nice.

24:06.135 --> 24:07.694
Ah. Sorry.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.813
Joe McUsic... Victim and killer?

24:18.265 --> 24:20.553
This is the best twist yet.

24:20.713 --> 24:23.528
Joe served on the jury of
a murder he committed.

24:23.529 --> 24:25.472
Yeah, but if Joe literally
got away with murder,

24:25.473 --> 24:28.246
why would he risk it all and
bribe his way onto the jury?

24:28.247 --> 24:30.375
Maybe he felt compelled
to save an innocent man.

24:30.669 --> 24:33.500
Maybe he wanted to create reasonable doubt

24:33.501 --> 24:36.052
in the deliberation room to get Otis off,

24:36.053 --> 24:38.976
just like Henry Fonda in "12 Angry Men."

24:38.977 --> 24:41.212
Or maybe he got onto the jury
because he wanted to make sure

24:41.213 --> 24:44.413
that an innocent Otis got
convicted of his crime.

24:44.501 --> 24:46.811
No. I like my "killer with a conscience" 
theory better.

24:46.812 --> 24:48.651
Yeah? Well, like your theory all you want.

24:48.652 --> 24:50.964
Mine is less convoluted and contrived.

24:50.965 --> 24:53.908
I hate to burst bubbles,
but you're both wrong.

24:54.017 --> 24:56.245
Joe did not kill Lyla. He had an alibi.

24:56.764 --> 24:58.872
I did a background on the halfway house.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.785
On the night Lyla was killed,
Joe was at a fund-raiser.

25:02.581 --> 25:03.874
He was there until midnight.

25:03.875 --> 25:06.881
And Lyla was killed between
9:30 and 11:30 P.M.

25:06.900 --> 25:07.648
So if he didn't kill her,

25:07.649 --> 25:09.141
why did he want to be on the jury so bad?

25:09.142 --> 25:11.334
And why was he at the crime scene?

25:11.488 --> 25:12.865
Okay, so we know

25:13.153 --> 25:15.793
that Joe was a juror with a hidden agenda.

25:16.177 --> 25:18.368
He was embroiled in a high-profile case

25:18.452 --> 25:20.309
being tried by the D.A. himself.

25:20.744 --> 25:22.936
But before he could accomplish
what he set out to do,

25:23.482 --> 25:26.697
he was struck down by
powerful, shadowy forces.

25:28.057 --> 25:29.049
What?

25:29.848 --> 25:31.504
There's gotta be something
that we're missing.

25:31.505 --> 25:33.432
There has to be a tangible connection

25:33.433 --> 25:35.716
between Joe and our defendant

25:35.717 --> 25:38.196
or Joe and our victim.

25:38.397 --> 25:41.601
Or between Joe and somebody else entirely.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.144
I found the phone.

25:43.181 --> 25:45.268
It was hiding behind some
books in the bookcase.

25:45.269 --> 25:48.596
Joe made 14 calls with it,
all to the same number.

25:49.946 --> 25:51.945
District attorney Lou Karnacki's office.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.192
Looks like the D.A. was out of order.

25:55.636 --> 25:58.181
Mrs. Craig...
Oh, please. Call me Dawn.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.332
Dawn, you are

26:00.333 --> 26:02.515
our district attorney's
administrative assistant?

26:02.516 --> 26:04.581
Yes, ever since he came into office.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.776
Do you remember ever receiving

26:05.777 --> 26:08.009
any phone calls from a Joe McUsic?

26:08.648 --> 26:11.788
Ooh. Uh, we get hundreds
of calls every day.

26:11.789 --> 26:14.251
Um, that name doesn't sound familiar.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.675
We have reason to believe
he called numerous times.

26:16.676 --> 26:17.656
He may have said

26:17.657 --> 26:20.101
it was regarding the Otis Williams case.

26:20.102 --> 26:21.520
Oh. Uh, yeah.

26:21.521 --> 26:24.835
I did get a series of
bizarre anonymous calls

26:24.836 --> 26:27.892
from a man claiming that
Otis Williams was innocent.

26:28.425 --> 26:30.819
That would be Joe.
Did he ever speak to the D.A.?

26:30.820 --> 26:33.993
No. I never put him through.
I figured he was a wacko.

26:34.409 --> 26:36.659
Well, you know, we get
a lot of these calls,

26:36.660 --> 26:38.506
and half my job is to filter out

26:38.507 --> 26:40.231
the legitimate calls from the crackpots.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.944
Did he ever mention anything else?

26:42.076 --> 26:44.380
Yeah. He said he had evidence

26:44.381 --> 26:46.551
that would exonerate Otis Williams,

26:46.552 --> 26:47.791
and how he was gonna mail it

26:47.792 --> 26:50.784
to the district attorney's office.
Did you ever get that package?

26:50.785 --> 26:52.161
Not that I know of.

26:52.355 --> 26:54.871
Uh, Dawn, most of these phone calls

26:54.872 --> 26:56.308
are under two minutes long.

26:56.309 --> 26:58.331
But then there's this one at 10:14 P.M.

26:58.332 --> 26:59.672
It's over ten minutes long.

26:59.673 --> 27:01.759
Is there any chance that
you took that phone call?

27:01.760 --> 27:04.673
Oh, no. I never stay past 7:00.

27:05.484 --> 27:07.185
How late does the D.A. work?

27:11.084 --> 27:12.830
This conversation is over.

27:21.672 --> 27:23.148
This is the way you keep me in the loop,

27:23.149 --> 27:24.820
Roy?
It's a fast-moving case, Lou.

27:24.821 --> 27:26.067
My team just followed the
evidence where it led them.

27:26.068 --> 27:29.031
Oh, don't give me that.
We've known each other too long.

27:29.032 --> 27:31.763
Mr. Karnacki, Joe McUsic
made several phone calls

27:31.764 --> 27:34.517
to your office.
One of them lasted over ten minutes.

27:34.912 --> 27:37.156
Did you speak to him, sir?
The dead juror?

27:37.157 --> 27:39.412
Yes.
No, of course not.

27:39.432 --> 27:40.588
Did he send you any evidence

27:40.589 --> 27:42.225
that was relevant to the
Otis Williams case?

27:42.226 --> 27:44.055
Excuse me.
I don't think we've been introduced.

27:44.056 --> 27:46.688
I'm the guy that can get you
banned from this precinct.

27:46.689 --> 27:48.923
And I can have you transferred
to the harbor unit!

27:48.924 --> 27:51.391
Lou, you said you wanted
this murder squared away.

27:51.392 --> 27:52.111
That's all we're doing.

27:52.112 --> 27:54.646
No, what you're doing
is sneaking around behind my back.

27:54.647 --> 27:57.807
Now the next time you want
an interview, you call.

27:57.808 --> 28:01.080
And don't you ever, ever, drag
one of my staff down here

28:01.081 --> 28:02.537
without my knowledge again.

28:06.883 --> 28:08.866
You called in the D.A.'s personal assistant

28:08.867 --> 28:11.097
without informing him?
Sir, I'm sorry. I was... I...

28:11.098 --> 28:12.584
It was a smart move.

28:13.969 --> 28:15.236
Don't you see what just happened?

28:15.237 --> 28:16.236
He could have called and asked

28:16.237 --> 28:19.261
why his assistant was here,
but he came in person.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.285
He wanted to stop the interview.

28:21.357 --> 28:22.701
He's hiding something.

28:32.476 --> 28:35.835
Wardell Williams was right.
It's a conspiracy.

28:35.981 --> 28:36.941
I agree.

28:38.115 --> 28:39.396
I know. 
Weird.

28:40.289 --> 28:41.811
Yeah, weird, but good,

28:41.812 --> 28:43.335
because that's just the tip of the iceberg.

28:43.336 --> 28:45.551
Are you ready for the "Titanic"? 
Yes.

28:46.212 --> 28:48.495
Good. I did a little
digging on the Internet.

28:48.496 --> 28:52.128
Guess who the D.A.'s largest 
campaign contributors were

28:52.193 --> 28:54.404
on his last election?
Who?

28:54.405 --> 28:58.456
Randolph and Andrea
Addison, Lyla's parents.

28:58.554 --> 28:59.555
Here's what I'm thinking...

28:59.556 --> 29:01.862
Devastated parents demand justice.

29:01.863 --> 29:04.424
Insist that the D.A. try
the case personally,

29:04.425 --> 29:07.501
maybe even suggest to Karnacki

29:07.502 --> 29:09.248
that he needs to put Lyla's killer away

29:09.249 --> 29:11.548
in order to secure their political support.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.268
Of course, and Karnacki agreed

29:13.269 --> 29:14.661
because it was gonna be an easy case.

29:14.662 --> 29:16.585
I mean, they already had Otis Williams.

29:16.586 --> 29:19.268
It was open and shut.
Until Joe starts calling,

29:19.269 --> 29:20.815
insisting that Otis is innocent,

29:20.816 --> 29:22.264
which is bad for Karnacki...

29:22.265 --> 29:24.409
Actually, in the end, bad for Joe.

29:24.793 --> 29:26.412
You know, but it still doesn't explain

29:26.413 --> 29:29.105
why Joe bought into the jury pool

29:30.077 --> 29:33.239
or why he thought that Otis
Williams was innocent.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.832
I mean, if he had exonerating
evidence, where is it?

29:35.833 --> 29:38.392
We've looked everywhere.
We've talked to everyone.

29:38.393 --> 29:39.497
Not everyone.

29:40.557 --> 29:41.359
As I said before,

29:41.360 --> 29:44.083
- we're not here to discuss
the Lyla Addison case. - Neither are we.

29:44.084 --> 29:46.231
We're here to talk about
Joe McUsic's murder...

29:46.232 --> 29:48.416
Juror number seven.
You're not still suggesting

29:48.417 --> 29:49.802
that my client had
something to do with that?

29:49.803 --> 29:51.926
Uh, we are open to the idea
that Mr. Williams

29:51.927 --> 29:53.592
may not be guilty of either murder.

29:53.593 --> 29:55.448
Look, we think that you might
be able to help yourself

29:55.449 --> 29:57.448
by helping us find the real killer.

30:04.448 --> 30:06.032
This is Joe McUsic.

30:06.380 --> 30:08.237
Had you ever seen him before the trial?

30:08.555 --> 30:09.757
Mnh-mnh.

30:09.885 --> 30:12.373
He claimed to have evidence
proving your innocence.

30:12.388 --> 30:14.101
Do you have any idea what
that evidence might be?

30:14.102 --> 30:16.355
How am I supposed to know?
He bought his way onto the jury

30:16.356 --> 30:17.587
in order to get you acquitted

30:17.588 --> 30:19.456
and then he got murdered for it.

30:22.149 --> 30:23.589
Well, look, I'm sorry he's dead.

30:23.833 --> 30:26.232
I appreciate my man putting
himself out like that for me,

30:26.233 --> 30:28.180
but I don't know how to help y'all.

30:28.181 --> 30:29.667
Mr. Williams, if you didn't kill Lyla,

30:29.668 --> 30:31.295
then we need to figure out who did.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.971
You were first on the scene.
Any detail you can remember,

30:33.972 --> 30:36.036
no matter how obscure, might help us.

30:39.357 --> 30:41.452
A'ight. It was late.

30:41.668 --> 30:44.740
Just got off my job, you know?
Walking home...

30:45.256 --> 30:48.088
When I saw that sweet 760i,

30:48.248 --> 30:51.240
just sitting there, keys in the ignition.

30:52.817 --> 30:54.392
I knew I shoulda passed it by,

30:54.393 --> 30:56.408
but I always wanted to drive a 760,

30:57.004 --> 30:57.644
so I jumped in.

30:57.645 --> 31:01.863
I'm sorry. We need details.
So did you see anyone?

31:01.864 --> 31:03.684
No.
Was there anything around the car?

31:03.685 --> 31:05.744
Anything that might suggest
someone else had been there...

31:05.745 --> 31:09.029
cigarette butts, uh, chewing gum... 
Shoe prints, heel prints?

31:09.030 --> 31:12.340
Nah, nothing like that.
Okay, um, what happened next?

31:12.492 --> 31:14.695
I slid in the ride, pulled the seat up,

31:14.696 --> 31:15.471
hit the ignition...

31:15.472 --> 31:18.441
Wait, wait.
Did you say you pulled the seat up?

31:18.442 --> 31:20.100
Yeah. Are you sure?

31:20.101 --> 31:22.855
Yeah, I'm sure.
That bad boy was all the way back,

31:22.856 --> 31:24.811
so I hit the button on
the side to move it up.

31:24.812 --> 31:26.488
Lyla was all of 5-foot-nothing.

31:26.489 --> 31:28.375
There's no reason for that seat
to have been all the way back.

31:28.376 --> 31:29.844
Somebody else was driving that car,

31:29.845 --> 31:30.848
most likely our killer.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.867
And our killer would have
to press the back button

31:32.868 --> 31:35.768
in order to move it. 
Did C.S.U. check for prints?

31:36.576 --> 31:38.603
The steering wheel and the dash.

31:38.604 --> 31:40.604
The only prints they
found were my client's,

31:40.605 --> 31:43.124
so when they caught him behind the wheel,

31:43.125 --> 31:45.012
I don't think they put much effort into it.

31:48.915 --> 31:50.772
Lyla's car is still at the
impound pending the trial.

31:50.773 --> 31:53.012
We can still have C.S.U. print
the seat controls.

31:55.366 --> 31:57.029
A seat back button?

31:57.562 --> 32:01.225
What a great detail for a murder mystery.
Only if we get a print.

32:01.269 --> 32:03.460
Yes, otherwise, we'll just
be looking for tall people.

32:03.465 --> 32:04.473
Yeah.

32:05.998 --> 32:06.957
Dad.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.352
H-hey.

32:11.792 --> 32:12.768
Everything all right?

32:14.105 --> 32:15.303
I'm sorry for yelling at you last...

32:15.304 --> 32:18.905
No, no, I... I violated your trust.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.132
I shouldn't have spied on you.

32:20.133 --> 32:22.961
That was wrong.
And I want you to see this...

32:24.225 --> 32:26.539
I am deleting that app...

32:26.540 --> 32:28.296
Now and forever.

32:28.949 --> 32:30.790
Okay? Gone.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.368
So... I'm sorry.

32:34.216 --> 32:35.272
Forgive me?

32:37.305 --> 32:38.857
But will you forgive me?

32:39.081 --> 32:40.201
Of course.

32:41.230 --> 32:43.469
So... tell me

32:43.568 --> 32:45.329
what happened in Williamsburg.

32:50.192 --> 32:53.005
Two days ago, a bunch of us
went to Keena's of Brooklyn.

32:53.006 --> 32:54.156
It's a boutique.

32:54.293 --> 32:55.665
And my friends thought it'd be cool

32:55.666 --> 32:58.305
if we all took a couple of things.
You shop...

32:59.520 --> 33:01.234
You were shoplifting?
No.

33:01.268 --> 33:02.641
I couldn't, but my friends did,

33:02.642 --> 33:05.072
and they said I was chicken.
So you went back to finish the job

33:05.073 --> 33:06.299
to impress your friends. 
No,

33:06.300 --> 33:07.694
I went back to pay for what they stole.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.916
I couldn't just let someone
get cheated like that.

33:09.917 --> 33:13.006
I took money out of my savings
and went back to the store...

33:14.836 --> 33:16.687
When I got there, I put cash
on the counter with a note

33:16.688 --> 33:18.360
and ran out as fast as I could.

33:20.677 --> 33:22.708
I don't know whether to be angry or proud.

33:25.224 --> 33:26.872
What friends were you with?
It doesn't matter.

33:26.873 --> 33:27.688
Of course it matters. 
I don't

33:27.689 --> 33:29.514
want you ha...
Who I was with is off the table.

33:30.117 --> 33:31.638
I'm not gonna narc on them.

33:33.858 --> 33:35.027
Again...

33:35.636 --> 33:36.964
Angry and proud.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.336
One question, though.

33:40.277 --> 33:43.044
If you didn't take anything,
why did you feel responsible?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.468
Because they're my friends.

33:46.341 --> 33:48.021
I guess somebody had to.

33:49.364 --> 33:50.628
It was the right thing to do.

33:52.625 --> 33:53.744
Don't you think

33:53.930 --> 33:55.641
they should be the ones paying...
Dad.

33:56.733 --> 33:58.404
Why are you even friends with these
girls in the first place?

33:58.405 --> 33:59.733
It's not that simple.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.742
No, you're right.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.976
It never is, is it?

34:10.058 --> 34:12.532
Oh, sorry.
Uh, no, detective Beckett, stay.

34:12.828 --> 34:14.058
I was just leaving.

34:15.949 --> 34:17.469
It won't happen again, dad.

34:19.088 --> 34:20.081
Promise.

34:27.677 --> 34:28.652
You okay?

34:29.708 --> 34:31.676
Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.

34:31.716 --> 34:32.931
Yeah, tell me about it.

34:34.243 --> 34:35.553
Is that the C.S.U. report?

34:36.706 --> 34:38.389
Two sets of prints on the seat controls.

34:38.391 --> 34:40.516
Otis' are on the seat up button.

34:40.516 --> 34:42.820
And on the seat back?
Take a look for yourself.

34:46.661 --> 34:48.228
You gotta be kidding me.

34:54.737 --> 34:56.168
This is the fingerprint that we pulled

34:56.168 --> 34:58.397
off Lyla Addison's car seat controls,

34:58.444 --> 35:00.795
and this is your fingerprint
that we have on file.

35:00.796 --> 35:02.178
They are a match.

35:02.481 --> 35:04.500
There must be some mistake.
There is no mistake.

35:04.501 --> 35:05.889
You were in Lyla Addison's car the

35:05.890 --> 35:08.633
night that she was killed.
I didn't even know Lyla.

35:08.634 --> 35:09.801
Yeah, you did.

35:10.559 --> 35:12.172
We showed your picture around.

35:12.779 --> 35:14.785
You're a bartender at
the Kiwi Seven Lounge.

35:14.786 --> 35:16.309
They pay you under the table, cash.

35:16.310 --> 35:18.717
Lyla's a silent partner.
You still want to go

35:18.718 --> 35:20.224
with the story that you don't know her?

35:22.814 --> 35:24.523
I think that you killed her,

35:24.524 --> 35:26.710
and then you dumped her body in her trunk.

35:26.711 --> 35:29.235
What you didn't count on was the guilt.

35:29.786 --> 35:31.651
You had to get it off your
chest, so you told Joe,

35:31.652 --> 35:34.564
but your brother, he was an honorable man.

35:34.565 --> 35:35.708
He wasn't gonna rat you out,

35:35.709 --> 35:37.028
but he wasn't gonna let an innocent man

35:37.029 --> 35:38.434
go to jail for life.

35:38.435 --> 35:40.207
So he called the D.A.

35:40.642 --> 35:42.340
When that didn't work, he got on the jury.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.497
But you... you found out.

35:45.906 --> 35:47.363
And you realized...

35:47.933 --> 35:50.198
You wouldn't be safe as
long as he was alive.

35:50.199 --> 35:51.975
And then you slipped into his apartment

35:52.243 --> 35:54.891
and you dosed his meds with cyanide.

35:55.109 --> 35:58.245
Dosed his meds? 
Making you the worst brother since Cain.

36:00.252 --> 36:01.715
That isn't what happened.

36:01.716 --> 36:03.152
Then what happened?

36:06.916 --> 36:08.145
Okay.

36:11.193 --> 36:12.121
Well, wait.

36:12.864 --> 36:14.243
Wait!

36:16.262 --> 36:18.625
I was there, but I didn't kill her.

36:19.229 --> 36:20.968
And I didn't kill my brother.

36:21.189 --> 36:22.798
But it doesn't really matter what I say,

36:22.799 --> 36:24.180
you won't believe me anyway.

36:24.181 --> 36:26.205
Well, considering your other
choice is murder one,

36:26.206 --> 36:27.527
I would roll the dice.

36:31.813 --> 36:33.823
Stephen killed Lyla.

36:34.602 --> 36:36.075
Stephen Addison...

36:36.538 --> 36:38.029
Her brother.

36:38.175 --> 36:40.408
And we had talked about Joe's condition.

36:41.079 --> 36:43.051
Stephen must have seen Joe on that jury

36:43.052 --> 36:44.494
and killed him, too.

36:44.859 --> 36:47.312
Stephen and Lyla were a pair of rich,

36:47.313 --> 36:49.056
spoiled coke fiends

36:49.057 --> 36:50.697
who needed to make a drug run,

36:50.698 --> 36:52.105
so they had me drive.

36:52.309 --> 36:54.191
Stephen's screwing around with this gun.

36:54.192 --> 36:56.950
This little trust-fund
gangster thinks he's so badass

36:56.951 --> 36:59.009
till we hit a pothole, and bang!

36:59.951 --> 37:01.516
The gun went off and hit Lyla.

37:01.963 --> 37:03.650
She died instantly.

37:05.758 --> 37:06.843
I freaked.

37:06.844 --> 37:08.615
But Stephen threatened to
point the finger at me

37:08.616 --> 37:10.013
if I told the truth.

37:10.639 --> 37:12.100
I'm so scared.

37:12.101 --> 37:14.503
I'm... I'm just a nobody.

37:15.254 --> 37:17.205
He's got million-dollar lawyers!

37:20.379 --> 37:22.154
We put her body in the trunk.

37:22.194 --> 37:23.444
And you dumped the car?

37:23.445 --> 37:25.107
Stephen said if we left it in the ghetto,

37:25.108 --> 37:27.805
the cops would think it was
a carjacking gone wrong.

37:28.159 --> 37:30.946
And then what happened?
We tossed our bloody clothes

37:30.947 --> 37:32.439
in a dumpster.

37:32.875 --> 37:36.348
And... I went to see Joe at his fund-raiser

37:37.427 --> 37:39.108
and I told him what happened.

37:42.434 --> 37:45.658
He said we couldn't leave
Lyla in a trunk like that.

37:46.171 --> 37:47.998
But by the time Joe got there,

37:47.999 --> 37:50.321
the cops had already pulled
over that black guy,

37:50.322 --> 37:51.687
so Joe went to that dumpster

37:51.688 --> 37:54.353
and got Stephen's bloody
clothes as insurance.

37:54.407 --> 37:56.150
That must be what Joe sent to the D.A.

37:57.399 --> 37:59.202
It's all my fault.

38:00.702 --> 38:03.261
My brother's dead, and it's all my fault.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.949
We can place Stephen at
Lyla's bar that night.

38:06.950 --> 38:10.451
But without physical evidence,
all we have is Eddie's word.

38:10.452 --> 38:12.061
What do you think we should do, sir?

38:12.062 --> 38:13.236
I'm sorry, detective.

38:13.516 --> 38:15.193
Looks like there's nothing you can do.

38:15.933 --> 38:17.910
W-what are you saying, we just
let him get away with it?

38:17.911 --> 38:19.034
Did I say that?

38:20.498 --> 38:22.097
Uh, sir, where are you going?

38:22.916 --> 38:24.672
To see an old friend.

38:32.237 --> 38:34.583
Hey. How'd you get in here?

38:35.470 --> 38:37.059
Used my key to the city.

38:37.432 --> 38:39.237
You, uh, you want a drink?

38:39.238 --> 38:42.199
I just got my hands on
this brilliant bottle

38:42.200 --> 38:44.310
of 1875 St. Miriam.

38:44.503 --> 38:46.167
I need that package, Lou.

38:46.886 --> 38:48.977
The one Joe McUsic sent you.

38:49.538 --> 38:50.762
I know you didn't get rid of it.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.393
It's not your style.
Not the Louis Karnacki I know.

38:55.352 --> 38:56.959
Word of advice, Roy.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.083
Just... let this one pass you by.

39:00.084 --> 39:02.722
Did you know Lyla Addison was
murdered by her brother?

39:04.826 --> 39:06.044
First rule of being a lawyer

39:06.045 --> 39:08.591
is never ask a question you
don't want an answer to.

39:08.592 --> 39:10.095
I guess it's good I'm not a lawyer.

39:10.096 --> 39:12.458
Yeah, well, that's the
problem with you cops.

39:12.459 --> 39:14.041
You live on the corner of black and white.

39:14.042 --> 39:17.725
But over here, on this side of
the street, it's just gray.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.240
You just put an innocent man up for murder.

39:19.241 --> 39:20.770
What's gray about that, Lou? 
Oh, come on!

39:20.771 --> 39:24.076
You're gonna sing "Kumbaya"
for Otis Williams?

39:24.718 --> 39:27.794
Otis Williams, what, theft,
uh, aggravated assault,

39:27.795 --> 39:30.316
attempted murder...
That's just the stuff we got him on.

39:30.353 --> 39:32.395
But he didn't kill Lyla, Lou.
He didn't kill her.

39:36.351 --> 39:38.348
It's for the greater good, Roy.

39:38.401 --> 39:39.171
What?

39:39.649 --> 39:41.707
You run for the Mayor's office?

39:43.516 --> 39:45.117
Think of what I can do for this city

39:45.118 --> 39:46.647
when I'm elected.

39:47.243 --> 39:48.329
Now...

39:48.543 --> 39:50.039
It takes money to get there,

39:50.856 --> 39:55.331
and the Addisons are keeping
the war chest well stocked.

39:56.410 --> 39:58.417
It's just how it's played.

39:58.725 --> 40:00.283
You know that.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.453
Oh... 
Listen to me, Roy.

40:07.454 --> 40:08.878
Listen to me.

40:10.003 --> 40:13.038
Roy Montgomery, police commissioner.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.120
Now... when I am elected,

40:16.121 --> 40:18.263
I will appoint you, I promise.

40:19.484 --> 40:21.006
You have my word on that.

40:21.197 --> 40:23.490
Think of what we could do for this city.

40:24.861 --> 40:26.665
You gotta let this go.

40:28.269 --> 40:29.708
Please.

40:32.501 --> 40:34.956
Give me the package Joe McUsic sent you...

40:35.535 --> 40:37.872
And I'll put in a good word for you.

40:44.830 --> 40:46.898
Preliminary lab results indicate

40:46.899 --> 40:49.029
at Stephen's clothes had
Lyla's blood on it.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.391
Eddie was telling the truth.

40:50.392 --> 40:53.346
And C.S.U. found traces of cyanide
in Stephen's apartment.

40:53.347 --> 40:55.341
Young Mr. Addison is going down
for both murders...

40:55.342 --> 40:56.795
Negligent homicide for his sister

40:56.796 --> 40:59.787
and murder one for Joe McUsic.
What happens to Eddie?

40:59.788 --> 41:01.510
We'll charge him with
accessory after the fact,

41:01.511 --> 41:04.340
but I'll push for probation.
I'll call the D.A...

41:05.524 --> 41:07.843
Well, whoever the Mayor
appoints as acting D.A.

41:09.631 --> 41:11.535
Sir, I'm sorry about your friend.

41:11.783 --> 41:12.299
Yeah.

41:14.125 --> 41:16.513
I mean, Lou screwed up. 
He did.

41:16.514 --> 41:18.279
But that doesn't take away
from the good he's done.

41:18.625 --> 41:20.459
It's unfortunate that
despite all that good,

41:20.460 --> 41:22.922
he's only gonna be remembered
for this one bad thing.

41:25.586 --> 41:27.419
Well, nice work, you two. 
Good night.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.185
So... plans with Josh tonight?

41:34.186 --> 41:35.846
No, he's on shift.

41:36.097 --> 41:38.224
I was thinking of sneaking
off to the Angelika.

41:38.577 --> 41:40.455
"Forbidden Planet" is playing.

41:40.962 --> 41:41.979
"Forbidden Planet"?

41:41.980 --> 41:45.058
Is, uh... is that the one with the robot?

41:46.405 --> 41:48.222
You've never seen "Forbidden Planet"?

41:48.223 --> 41:51.115
More of a "Star Wars," "Matrix" guy myself.

41:51.116 --> 41:51.809
Oh, my gosh.

41:51.810 --> 41:55.540
Castle, this is the movie
that inspired those two.

41:55.541 --> 41:57.058
That's it. I'm taking you.

41:57.059 --> 41:59.833
My treat. 
Oh, no, no. I-I, uh, I have plans.

41:59.834 --> 42:01.637
Nope, not anymore.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.708
All right. Well, can I have,
uh, candy and popcorn?

42:06.709 --> 42:09.233
Sure. 
Oh, Castle, you're gonna love this.

42:09.234 --> 42:10.491
This is Leslie Nielsen

42:10.492 --> 42:13.111
before he became a comic genius.

42:13.343 --> 42:13.881
Really?

42:13.882 --> 42:14.667
Yeah.

42:15.245 --> 42:17.059
Can we stop at Remy's for burgers after?

42:17.060 --> 42:18.727
Now you're pushing it. 
Oh.

42:18.728 --> 42:19.611
I'm kidding.

42:19.898 --> 42:21.462
So it starts off

42:21.463 --> 42:23.621
at the beginning of the 23rd century...
