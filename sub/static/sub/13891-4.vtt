00:45.769 --> 00:47.408
Kryten, it's me.
Are you there?

00:47.409 --> 00:50.168
'Er, yes, sir, I'm
here, sir, reading you. Over.'

00:50.169 --> 00:55.008
There's something on Little
Monitor 2. Weird shape.
Really massive. What is it?

00:55.009 --> 00:57.809
'It's your kebab, sir,
as requested. Over.'

00:59.289 --> 01:00.809
What, this is a kebab?!

01:04.129 --> 01:06.968
Wow! It's absolutely massive!
It's a monster!

01:06.969 --> 01:11.129
'A large chicken doner combo, salad,
chilli sauce, everything. Over.'

01:11.853 --> 01:14.172
All right, I'm going in!

01:14.173 --> 01:16.133
'Good luck, sir!'

01:50.773 --> 01:52.853
What?!

01:55.173 --> 01:56.933
No way!

01:57.973 --> 02:00.652
What's that smell?
Has there been a fire in here?

02:00.653 --> 02:03.412
Just a small one.
I put it out with my beer.

02:03.413 --> 02:05.612
For goodness' sake, Lister,
that's terrible!

02:05.613 --> 02:08.412
Don't panic! I've got another one.

02:08.413 --> 02:10.372
You can't eat in the drive room.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.812
No foods or liquids
around the work stations.

02:12.813 --> 02:14.892
Health and Safety Protocol 121.

02:14.893 --> 02:17.452
Who cares about health and safety,
Rimmer?

02:17.453 --> 02:21.652
We're getting life signs from
this moon, 200 clicks east.
I'm going to check it out!

02:21.653 --> 02:25.452
Lister, we have health and
safety protocols for a reason -
to safeguard the crew.

02:25.453 --> 02:26.492
What crew?

02:26.493 --> 02:30.052
The original crew? They all got
wiped out, remember?

02:30.053 --> 02:31.933
Exactly. By you!

02:33.213 --> 02:34.252
Exactly.

02:34.253 --> 02:36.372
When you didn't fix
that drive plate properly,

02:36.373 --> 02:38.493
and that radiation leak
fried them to a crisp.

02:39.653 --> 02:40.933
Exactly.

02:42.133 --> 02:45.972
Which is why the whole
health and safety protocol
procedure has been updated.

02:45.973 --> 02:48.932
Because, ultimately, who was truly
to blame for that accident?

02:48.933 --> 02:50.612
The man... or the system?

02:50.613 --> 02:51.852
The man.

02:51.853 --> 02:53.612
Was it the man, though?

02:53.613 --> 02:55.052
It was, yes.

02:55.053 --> 02:56.452
Or was it the system?

02:56.453 --> 02:58.413
It was the man,
definitely the man.

02:58.414 --> 02:59.772
Or was it the system?

02:59.773 --> 03:01.292
The man.

03:01.293 --> 03:04.092
A system that allowed a technician
to repair a drive plate

03:04.093 --> 03:06.172
without adequate training
or know-how.

03:06.173 --> 03:09.012
A system that has since been
completely overhauled
by yours truly,

03:09.013 --> 03:11.373
so that an accident of that
nature never happens again.

03:11.374 --> 03:12.892
So what you're saying is,

03:12.893 --> 03:17.052
you learned valuable safety lessons
from wiping out the crew
and, as a result,

03:17.053 --> 03:18.893
you've updated the safety
regulations,

03:18.894 --> 03:22.172
making this ship
a much safer working environment

03:22.173 --> 03:24.173
for the crew you wiped out.

03:25.253 --> 03:28.412
Scoff away, Lister, but the point is
we have new regulations,

03:28.413 --> 03:30.532
which means that
you're going to have to fill in

03:30.533 --> 03:32.493
an accident report form for
that fire.

03:32.494 --> 03:37.052
A what?! And once it's completed,
you'll have to submit it to the
Accident Report Assessment Unit,

03:37.053 --> 03:38.813
care of the Health and Safety
Executive.

03:38.814 --> 03:40.372
And who the smeg would that be?

03:40.373 --> 03:41.653
Me.

03:45.053 --> 03:46.452
There are the forms.

03:46.453 --> 03:49.932
I am not filling out any
smegging forms, Rimmer!

03:49.933 --> 03:51.452
I'm going to check this moon.

03:51.453 --> 03:54.252
Ignore that, and someone
could get seriously hurt.

03:54.253 --> 03:56.053
Yeah - you, if you keep talking!

03:57.093 --> 03:59.412
Hang on a minute! It's 20 pages!

03:59.413 --> 04:01.573
I'll send you on the other
sections later.

04:19.973 --> 04:21.411
You're up late, sir.

04:21.413 --> 04:22.732
Been hunting.

04:22.733 --> 04:26.012
Trying to swat this damn
space weevil.

04:26.013 --> 04:28.413
Little sucker keeps outsmarting me!

04:29.493 --> 04:32.093
Well, they do have an IQ of 2, sir.

04:35.053 --> 04:38.692
One minute it's there, next minute
it's gone. It's driving me crazy!

04:38.693 --> 04:41.452
What's happening with you?
Well, I've been running some tests

04:41.453 --> 04:44.972
on the crystals I extracted
from the quantum rod, sir.

04:44.973 --> 04:48.052
A by-product of the rod's ability
to transport its host vessel

04:48.053 --> 04:50.972
seems to be a curious power
of synchronicity.

04:50.973 --> 04:53.372
That's strange.
Before, I was napping,

04:53.373 --> 04:56.172
and I had a dream you were doing
something crazy with crystals.

04:56.173 --> 04:58.372
What a weird coincidence.

04:58.373 --> 05:01.372
Hey! We both said
that at the same time!

05:01.373 --> 05:02.452
And that!

05:02.453 --> 05:04.092
What's going on?!

05:04.093 --> 05:06.333
Why are we saying
everything together?!

05:07.653 --> 05:09.693
Probably just coincidence.

05:20.293 --> 05:21.892
I think that's fixed it, sir.

05:21.893 --> 05:24.371
You think that tube thing made us
speak at the same time?

05:24.372 --> 05:25.453
I doubt it, sir.

05:25.454 --> 05:28.452
Probably just coincidence.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.452
What the hell's going on?!

05:30.453 --> 05:33.132
Well, it seems the crystals,
temporarily at least,

05:33.133 --> 05:36.972
have invigorated our psi, making us
more prone to coincidence.

05:36.973 --> 05:39.492
There was a fascinating book
on the subject

05:39.493 --> 05:45.333
by a scientist
called Arthur Koestler which was
called The Roots Of Coincidence.

05:49.053 --> 05:50.692
There it is!

05:50.693 --> 05:52.332
How weird is that?!

05:52.333 --> 05:55.812
According to Koestler, coincidence is
more likely to happen

05:55.813 --> 05:58.292
to people in states of
heightened emotion,

05:58.293 --> 06:02.932
as emotions lower consciousness
while increasing the powers
of the unconscious.

06:02.933 --> 06:05.052
So, every time we're together
and emotional,

06:05.053 --> 06:07.572
we're likely to experience
this coincidence stuff?

06:07.573 --> 06:09.212
Only temporarily, sir.

06:09.213 --> 06:11.053
Space weevil!

06:14.453 --> 06:18.092
Mr Lister, some rather intriguing
developments on the, er...

06:18.093 --> 06:19.132
Oh.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.732
Mr Lister?

06:20.733 --> 06:22.413
Well...

06:26.133 --> 06:27.133
Kryten!

06:28.533 --> 06:29.892
Open the door!

06:29.893 --> 06:31.853
I've left my key!

06:33.453 --> 06:35.053
Open the door!

06:36.173 --> 06:37.613
Let me in!

06:47.533 --> 06:50.212
Sir, what on earth
were you doing outside?!

06:50.213 --> 06:52.532
Trying to get in!
Wasn't it obvious?

06:52.533 --> 06:56.012
We've had a life sign confirmation
from one of the scouters.

06:56.013 --> 06:58.212
I took Starbug to check it out.

06:58.213 --> 07:01.892
That's the second moon
with life signs we've passed
in the last decade!

07:01.893 --> 07:05.053
I had no idea this region of space
was so lively.

07:06.333 --> 07:10.092
Yeah, it's mental
round here, Kryten,
you never get a moment's peace!

07:10.093 --> 07:14.252
Anyway, they're called BEGGs,
Biologically Engineered Garbage
Gobblers,

07:14.253 --> 07:17.732
created on Earth to eat refuse.
They've got this digestive system

07:17.733 --> 07:20.572
that can cope with scoffing
sediment, sludge and slop,

07:20.573 --> 07:24.332
permanently inebriated, with breath
that could sandblast buildings.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.252
I'm so pleased for you, sir.

07:26.253 --> 07:28.932
At last you've got the opportunity
to make new friends.

07:28.933 --> 07:31.972
I wanted to see if they'd help
in finding Kochanski.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.652
Did they, sir?

07:33.653 --> 07:35.372
Nah, they've not seen her.

07:35.373 --> 07:38.412
Just spent the whole evening
drinking whisky and playing poker.
Anyway...

07:38.413 --> 07:41.812
Incidentally, sir, why WERE you
outside with a jet-pack?

07:41.813 --> 07:42.852
Let me finish.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.532
As I was saying...
Sir, where is Starbug?

07:45.533 --> 07:48.732
Let me finish! As I was saying,
we were sat round the...

07:48.733 --> 07:51.572
Sir! You lost Starbug
in a card game?!

07:51.573 --> 07:53.532
You've spoilt the end now!

07:53.533 --> 07:56.892
Don't look at me like that.
There is an upside.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.173
Upside, how can there be
an upside? What's the upside?

07:59.174 --> 08:01.053
I lost Rimmer too.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.252
Pick him up Friday.

08:04.253 --> 08:07.732
That's tomorrow! Oh, sir, what on
earth are we going to do?

08:07.733 --> 08:11.573
I know. 24 hours - it's going to be
worse than being a kid
on Christmas Eve.

08:12.733 --> 08:16.692
Oh, all right, all right. I'll go
back tomorrow, get him back somehow.

08:16.693 --> 08:17.772
Starbug too.

08:17.773 --> 08:18.973
Speaking of Mr Rimmer,

08:18.974 --> 08:22.612
he asked me to give you these
accident report forms for you
to fill in.

08:22.613 --> 08:23.893
Oh, cheers, Krytes.

08:24.973 --> 08:26.853
Good night.

08:49.533 --> 08:53.092
Just drying the cutlery, sir,
using my heat outlet.

08:53.093 --> 08:55.452
Kryten, where's Lister?
Have you seen him?

08:55.453 --> 08:57.772
I think he may be
in the drive room, sir.

08:57.773 --> 09:00.492
Has he had an opportunity
to talk to you yet, sir?

09:00.493 --> 09:02.812
Why? No reason, sir,
I was just wondering.

09:02.813 --> 09:06.812
Do you know
if he's completed that sheaf
of health and safety forms yet?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.812
I think he may need another set, sir.

09:08.813 --> 09:11.812
You see, there was a slight
accident with the airlock,

09:11.813 --> 09:15.292
and the papers were accidentally
sucked out into space, sir.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.293
Another accident?

09:18.933 --> 09:22.692
That means he's going to have
to fill out two sets
of accident report forms.

09:22.693 --> 09:23.973
I'll get the papers.

09:23.974 --> 09:28.252
Well, it wasn't an accident per se,
sir. You mean, he just flushed them
out into space?

09:28.253 --> 09:31.612
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly
like that, sir...

09:31.613 --> 09:33.053
Were safety procedures followed?

09:33.054 --> 09:36.692
Was an airlock accident risk
assessment form completed
before he opened the airlock?

09:36.693 --> 09:39.372
That may have been overlooked, sir.

09:39.373 --> 09:42.252
Well, that's another set of forms
he's going to have to fill in.

09:42.253 --> 09:43.813
I don't know whether
I've got enough.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.653
Flushing safety reports into
space...

10:03.533 --> 10:05.373
He's not going to get away
with this.

10:05.374 --> 10:08.213
There's got to be a solution
to this.

10:09.493 --> 10:12.692
I've just been speaking to Kryten,
and he told me what you did.

10:12.693 --> 10:15.572
Did he? I have to say,
I'm disappointed,

10:15.573 --> 10:17.093
but not the least bit surprised.

10:18.413 --> 10:19.452
Right.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.092
Well, you're taking it better
than I expected.

10:22.093 --> 10:25.412
Expect people to let you down -
you'll never be disappointed.

10:25.413 --> 10:28.972
Let me say right off
that I'm truly sorry, I really am.

10:28.973 --> 10:30.972
You're not sorry.
Of course I'm sorry!

10:30.973 --> 10:33.453
I've been up all night thinking
about it. I can't sleep!

10:33.454 --> 10:34.892
Are you serious?

10:34.893 --> 10:38.212
Of course I'm serious! What I did
was out of order, out of line,

10:38.213 --> 10:40.292
beyond the pale.

10:40.293 --> 10:42.172
Wow.

10:42.173 --> 10:46.652
And just let me say, I'll put
everything to rights first thing
in the morning.

10:46.653 --> 10:48.173
I promise.

10:49.893 --> 10:53.732
Finally, after all these years of
battering my head against a wall,

10:53.733 --> 10:56.372
trying to make you into
a person of calibre and stature,

10:56.373 --> 10:58.932
who takes pride
in the mundane and petty,

10:58.933 --> 11:00.413
at last the penny's dropped.

11:00.414 --> 11:01.972
Listey,

11:01.973 --> 11:08.053
I think you're finally
become the vending machine
third technician of my dreams!

11:11.613 --> 11:12.732
What's this?

11:12.733 --> 11:14.253
The accident report forms.

11:15.533 --> 11:19.252
I haven't got time to waste
twatting about with that!

11:19.253 --> 11:20.492
What?!

11:20.493 --> 11:23.932
I've got to dig myself out of
this hole I've got myself into.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.252
Hole, what hole?

11:25.253 --> 11:27.932
The gambling with BEGGs hole.

11:27.933 --> 11:30.052
Gambling with BEGGs?

11:30.053 --> 11:32.252
You've been gambling with BEGGs?!

11:32.253 --> 11:33.772
Those garbage-munchers!

11:33.773 --> 11:36.052
Lister, I've told you
a million times...

11:36.053 --> 11:39.052
you gamble with lowlifes,
there's only one loser.

11:39.053 --> 11:40.893
In this case, there's two!

11:42.133 --> 11:43.213
Who's the other one?

11:43.214 --> 11:46.253
A guy about your height,
your colouring, who goes
by the name of you.

11:47.293 --> 11:50.292
Er, Mr Lister gambled you
in a poker game, sir,

11:50.293 --> 11:52.453
and I'm afraid to report,
he lost you.

11:53.493 --> 11:55.292
We're all deeply sorry, bud...

11:55.293 --> 11:57.453
apart from me and him and him.

12:00.293 --> 12:02.013
Do you really think this is helping?

12:02.014 --> 12:03.692
I'm not here to help!

12:03.693 --> 12:05.612
Read my CV.

12:05.613 --> 12:10.893
"Does not help. Does not clean.
Will have sex with anything."

12:13.373 --> 12:14.972
You lost me in a poker game?!

12:14.973 --> 12:17.212
Like I'm some kind of thing

12:17.213 --> 12:19.453
to be lost in a poker game?!

12:20.533 --> 12:22.252
I was trying to win Starbug back.

12:22.253 --> 12:24.133
I didn't have anything else
they wanted.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.772
Right. Turn the engines up
full power. We'll outrun them.

12:26.773 --> 12:30.132
Once they realise they can't
catch us, they'll give up.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.173
Ah, we can't outrun them. Why not?

12:41.413 --> 12:44.813
Wow! Cool pants, bud!

12:46.533 --> 12:49.132
Oh, that's a groin exploder, sir.

12:49.133 --> 12:50.732
It sure is!

12:50.733 --> 12:53.252
That's going to drive
the chicks nuts!

12:53.253 --> 12:55.732
If I don't make good on my debt...

12:55.733 --> 12:57.613
deliver Rimmer by midnight
tomorrow...

12:57.614 --> 13:00.972
then this thing is going to propel
my love spuds

13:00.973 --> 13:03.972
to the far reaches of deep space.

13:03.973 --> 13:06.972
So what? You never use them anyway!

13:06.973 --> 13:09.332
Have you tried removing it, sir?

13:09.333 --> 13:11.332
It's rigged to blow
if I tamper with it.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.332
There's a sign on the side -
"E-R-R-A".

13:14.333 --> 13:17.532
ERRA? Must be something to do
with the manufacturer,
but I can't trace them.

13:17.533 --> 13:20.932
I have to say I'm taking
no pleasure from this.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.052
No pleasure whatsoever.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.772
No, wait. In fact,
that's completely wrong.

13:25.773 --> 13:28.852
I'm taking immense pleasure
from this.

13:28.853 --> 13:33.732
It may not have occurred, sir,
but if the exploder detonates,
killing Mr Lister,

13:33.733 --> 13:38.012
then the ship will automatically shut
down your hologram projection unit.

13:38.013 --> 13:40.812
If Mr Lister goes, you go with him.

13:40.813 --> 13:43.172
You're both sort of... connected.

13:43.173 --> 13:44.492
Like we are!

13:44.493 --> 13:47.212
What a coincidence!

13:47.213 --> 13:49.052
A thought occurs, sir.

13:49.053 --> 13:52.652
This technology is way beyond
anything the BEGGs could manufacture.

13:52.653 --> 13:57.812
They have a low cunning, but are
a primitive race of little
sophistication.

13:57.813 --> 14:00.173
Maybe that's our answer.

14:14.139 --> 14:16.978
Weh-for-a-borg-ka-sming! Ha-ha-ha!

14:18.237 --> 14:22.396
He says, "Ah, so, you return
with my winnings! Ha-ha-ha!"

14:22.484 --> 14:24.563
And in keeping with our agreement,

14:24.564 --> 14:27.204
you deactivate the knacker attacker,
yeah?

14:28.484 --> 14:29.763
Bew-ka-fing?

14:29.764 --> 14:31.284
Is that the hologram?

14:32.364 --> 14:36.283
Yes, it is, but as you can see, he's
old and raddled and fit for nothing.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.283
Scrom-jella!

14:37.284 --> 14:38.643
Fhoom, olla-goon.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.563
Chall-ah-gah! Raddled.
Mon-blaga. Dro-go.

14:41.564 --> 14:44.043
Instead, I bring you this.

14:44.044 --> 14:46.283
O-galla kra-goom-oo, hoon!

14:46.284 --> 14:48.003
The fabled...

14:48.004 --> 14:50.204
spoon of destiny.

14:51.404 --> 14:55.203
He that hath the spoon
controls all things.

14:55.204 --> 14:57.923
No object hath such power.

14:57.924 --> 15:00.763
Oom-balla-scoom-droo!

15:00.764 --> 15:04.923
Hmm-yalla controls
tra-la-loomo drob-oh!

15:04.924 --> 15:08.363
He-swar-gyent-oo-moo?

15:08.364 --> 15:11.825
He says, if the spoon controls all
things, why are you trading it?

15:12.057 --> 15:13.738
Um...

15:13.796 --> 15:18.035
Well, we just don't... really... use
it much any more.

15:18.036 --> 15:19.415
And, um...

15:19.499 --> 15:20.898
It's a good question.

15:20.899 --> 15:26.898
We prefer the ship of green
and a sexy light man

15:26.899 --> 15:30.619
with the lady legs so long
and luscious.

15:33.259 --> 15:34.419
He speaks English!

15:34.420 --> 15:36.618
La-bogo-a-row-go-bay-len...

15:36.619 --> 15:40.978
English boarding school.
Bilan-garoo.

15:40.979 --> 15:42.939
What, he went to an English boarding
school?

15:42.940 --> 15:45.498
Ah, no, sir, he ate someone
from an English boarding school.

15:45.499 --> 15:49.818
He forced them to teach him English
and then he munched them whole.

15:49.819 --> 15:53.818
If it pleases, maybe we will play
cards again.

15:53.819 --> 15:59.098
Then perhaps you will win back your
hologram and your ship of green.

15:59.099 --> 16:04.178
Or maybe you will lose, and,
if you do, we will take your droid!

16:04.179 --> 16:08.538
And your scented, shiny friend too.

16:10.739 --> 16:14.459
Look, we've got nothing to lose.
Let's play.

16:16.419 --> 16:18.378
I have a bad feeling about this.

16:18.379 --> 16:20.778
I've got this one, Krytes.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.178
Sir, you're being set up again.
Don't you see?

16:23.179 --> 16:26.218
They're not simple people, they're
every bit as smart as you or I!

16:26.219 --> 16:28.659
Yeah, I was close the last time,
I just got a bit cocky!

16:28.660 --> 16:30.698
You choked! You always choke!

16:30.699 --> 16:34.338
You can't handle the pressure, bud.
If anyone's going to choke,
they'll choke.

16:34.339 --> 16:36.818
They'll choke?!
Yeah, they're the chokers.

16:36.819 --> 16:40.618
They're not going to choke.

16:40.619 --> 16:45.019
They're choking! Don't choke!
How do you get out of this?

16:46.299 --> 16:48.418
Don't die! How do you
get out of the exploder?

16:48.419 --> 16:51.138
What's he saying, Kryten?

16:51.139 --> 16:55.978
He's speaking Choking To Death, sir.
It's very hard to translate
if you're not being strangled.

16:55.979 --> 16:57.618
Don't die, don't die!

16:57.619 --> 17:00.458
Argh!

17:00.459 --> 17:04.417
Argh! The only guys that can help me
get out of this thing

17:04.419 --> 17:08.699
and now they're dead!
What am I going to do now?!

17:12.259 --> 17:13.578
Let me get this right.

17:13.579 --> 17:16.818
You guys have become...
quantum entangled somehow?

17:16.819 --> 17:18.018
Exactly.

17:18.019 --> 17:19.377
So you killed them?

17:19.378 --> 17:21.858
Oh, that event was always
going to occur.

17:21.858 --> 17:25.617
It's just, with our heightened
emotions, we were more
aware of the synchronicity.

17:25.618 --> 17:27.698
Who cares?! What am I going
to do now?

17:27.699 --> 17:30.578
Perhaps we can harness
our new-found powers to help, sir.

17:30.579 --> 17:32.058
How?

17:32.059 --> 17:35.298
Well, Koestler said intense emotional
states tend to drive coincidence.

17:35.299 --> 17:38.778
So you're saying we need to make you
two emotional?

17:38.779 --> 17:41.098
Precisely. Getting me emotional?

17:41.099 --> 17:42.859
That's going to be harder
than you think.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.458
Ever heard of the expression
"as cool as a Cat"?

17:46.459 --> 17:48.939
We're pretty hard to fluster,
buddy.

17:50.179 --> 17:51.778
Stage one achieved.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.178
What do we do now?

17:53.179 --> 17:54.939
Who turned that on?

17:56.059 --> 17:57.898
'He's in danger, isn't he?

17:57.899 --> 18:00.458
'Oh, darling. Can't we help him?

18:00.459 --> 18:03.058
'He's got to get to the station.
It's his only chance.

18:03.059 --> 18:04.419
'But there's so little time!'

18:04.420 --> 18:07.178
Station? Maybe some space station.

18:07.179 --> 18:09.378
'It's up to him now.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.218
'His fate is...

18:11.219 --> 18:14.458
'written in the stars.'

18:14.459 --> 18:16.417
Maybe the stars
are something to do with this?

18:16.418 --> 18:17.619
It's that book again.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.778
I'm not even going to say it.

18:19.779 --> 18:21.338
Look! Stars.

18:21.339 --> 18:22.498
And numbers.

18:22.499 --> 18:24.898
2-5-2-3-1-1.

18:24.899 --> 18:27.138
Those sound like
space coordinates.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.778
That's getting really annoying.

18:28.779 --> 18:33.178
That's what E-R-R-A
is. It's a space station!

18:33.179 --> 18:37.058
Maybe the device was manufactured on
the space station

18:37.059 --> 18:38.858
and ended up on this moon somehow!

18:38.859 --> 18:43.299
Let's punch these numbers into the
navicom and see where it takes us.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.402
So what is that place?

18:46.501 --> 18:49.420
It's the Erroneous Reasoning
Research Academy, sir,

18:49.421 --> 18:51.140
or ERRA, for short.

18:51.141 --> 18:53.700
Erroneous reasoning? What's that?

18:53.701 --> 18:55.621
Most of the great scientific
breakthroughs

18:55.622 --> 18:58.180
come when two theories previously
dismissed as wrong

18:58.181 --> 18:59.900
are combined to make a right.

18:59.901 --> 19:04.220
The DNA double helix was discovered
in this exact way.

19:04.221 --> 19:05.341
What did they do here?

19:05.342 --> 19:07.620
Well, they specialised
in wrongness, sir.

19:07.621 --> 19:09.500
Wrongness?!

19:09.501 --> 19:12.540
The staff were hand-picked
for their ability to be mistaken,

19:12.541 --> 19:16.300
for their gifts in fallacious
analysis and defective reasoning.

19:16.301 --> 19:18.181
You could have excelled here!

19:19.461 --> 19:23.341
They were all outstandingly good
at being consistently incorrect.

19:24.741 --> 19:28.101
There were a lot of referees,
TV critics, weathermen...

19:29.421 --> 19:32.100
who were then re-educated
in the sciences

19:32.101 --> 19:35.380
to develop extraordinary new
erroneous theories

19:35.381 --> 19:38.980
that would be combined together
to produce works of great genius.

19:38.981 --> 19:40.020
Did it work?

19:40.021 --> 19:41.061
No.

19:42.141 --> 19:44.660
The whole idea turned out to be
wrong.

19:44.661 --> 19:48.340
The man behind the idea was
so depressed, he attempted suicide.

19:48.341 --> 19:52.981
Naturally, he failed and he went on
to live into his 90s.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.740
Look, we know the device
was manufactured here.

19:58.741 --> 20:01.340
The key to getting out of this has
got to be here somewhere.

20:01.341 --> 20:03.260
Logging on to the mainframe.

20:03.261 --> 20:04.780
Oh, interesting.

20:04.781 --> 20:08.340
There appears to be some
kind of life form in stasis.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.060
Maybe we can ask their advice!

20:10.061 --> 20:11.700
Top floor.

20:11.701 --> 20:15.140
I pressed top floor.
How come we're going down?

20:15.141 --> 20:16.581
I'll press down.

20:19.461 --> 20:21.140
Now we're going up!

20:21.141 --> 20:23.740
Everything is wrong here!

20:23.741 --> 20:25.821
I don't think you're right, Kryten.

20:26.901 --> 20:28.780
I assure you I am, sir.

20:28.781 --> 20:30.820
No. I like this place.

20:30.821 --> 20:32.620
I'm very comfortable here.

20:32.621 --> 20:37.541
The smell, the atmosphere.
It feels like... home.

20:42.901 --> 20:44.740
The stasis booths are in there.

20:44.741 --> 20:46.141
How the hell do we get in?

20:46.142 --> 20:48.380
Pity none of us can walk
through walls!

20:48.381 --> 20:50.180
Oh, well, one of us can!

20:50.181 --> 20:53.260
Mr Rimmer, if he switches
to soft light projection mode.

20:53.261 --> 20:55.701
Once I'm in, change back
to hard light projection mode.

20:55.702 --> 20:59.060
Highly likely there'll be
a switch to open the door
from inside the vault.

20:59.061 --> 21:02.860
Whatever. Can you just make it
quick? Cos this is getting hotter.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.541
I'm getting baked potatoes!

21:05.941 --> 21:08.741
It sounds like it's getting
ready to blow. Come on.

21:18.901 --> 21:20.540
Can you read me, sir?

21:20.541 --> 21:21.941
Switching you over now.

21:23.701 --> 21:25.940
'Back to hard light, over.'

21:25.941 --> 21:27.380
See anything?

21:27.381 --> 21:30.620
'Eyes adjusting, walking along...
Wait.

21:30.621 --> 21:32.420
'Stasis booths, banks of them.'

21:32.421 --> 21:33.460
Anything?

21:33.461 --> 21:35.620
'There's a light on in one of
the booths.

21:35.621 --> 21:37.380
'Whatever it is, it's alive.

21:37.381 --> 21:41.300
'According to the read-outs,
female, aged 31.'

21:41.301 --> 21:42.780
Kochanski's female.

21:42.781 --> 21:44.260
Kochanski's 31!

21:44.261 --> 21:45.620
Is it Kochanski?

21:45.621 --> 21:48.060
'Whoever it is, they're
brunette, 5'5".'

21:48.061 --> 21:50.780
Kochanski's brunette.
Kochanski's 5'5"!

21:50.781 --> 21:51.939
Is it Kochanski?

21:51.940 --> 21:53.861
'Starting pod deactivation sequence.

21:53.862 --> 21:55.660
'Getting ID info.

21:55.661 --> 21:57.421
'Give me two minutes.
Going offline.'

21:57.422 --> 22:00.180
Oh, it won't be her. It'll be
someone else. It won't be her.

22:00.181 --> 22:03.900
I know it's not her. Don't even
think for one second that I
think that it's her,

22:03.901 --> 22:05.459
because I know it isn't,
I know it.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.339
Say it is...
Do you think it might be?

22:07.340 --> 22:09.741
Think it's something to
do with this coincidence thing?

22:09.742 --> 22:11.701
Could be!

22:12.741 --> 22:15.180
The door's opening! Here we go.

22:15.181 --> 22:17.460
It's not Kochanski.
It won't be Kochanski.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.741
It won't be Kochanski.

22:20.061 --> 22:22.620
Gentlemen. Meet Professor Edgington,

22:22.621 --> 22:26.261
head of the ERRA Institute and
inventor of the groinal exploder.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.860
Well, it's definitely not Kochanski.

22:38.861 --> 22:40.301
She went for my groin.

22:46.821 --> 22:51.500
Most fascinating. She was working on
a research programme into evolution,

22:51.598 --> 22:56.117
attempting to evolve into the next
species of the evolutionary ladder.

22:56.118 --> 22:58.437
Naturally, the professor,
as a gifted ERRA-pert,

22:58.529 --> 23:00.248
got the experiment totally wrong.

23:00.249 --> 23:04.608
So basically, she took
an evolutionary wrong turn
and wound up a monkey?

23:04.609 --> 23:06.609
She should've stopped
and asked directions!

23:08.289 --> 23:13.048
Much as I'm enjoying this
chitchat, it ain't helping me
get this ball-buster off.

23:13.049 --> 23:14.209
I believe it is, sir.

23:14.210 --> 23:18.568
This is the very machine
Professor Edgington carried out
her operation with.

23:18.569 --> 23:21.928
Now, if we can evolve her
back to her human form,

23:21.929 --> 23:23.648
she may be able to help us.

23:23.649 --> 23:26.768
I've studied the manual,
it seems quite straightforward.

23:26.769 --> 23:29.248
I'm amazed she got it so wrong!

23:29.249 --> 23:31.809
Come on, let's go, switch it on.
Turning on now, sir.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.448
Pressing "undo" now.

23:34.449 --> 23:37.088
Evolution mode... engaged.

23:37.089 --> 23:38.729
Oo-oo-oo!

23:41.769 --> 23:44.088
Oh, smeg! She's human.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.328
Oh, smeg! She's naked.

23:46.329 --> 23:48.888
She's also naked.

23:48.889 --> 23:51.568
Did anyone mention that yet?
Is she naked?

23:51.569 --> 23:52.967
Oh, yes! I didn't notice.

23:52.968 --> 23:54.729
I'll go and get her a sheet
immediately.

23:54.730 --> 23:56.048
No rush, Kryten.

23:56.049 --> 23:58.368
Remember Protocol 175...

23:58.369 --> 24:00.328
no running in the corridors.

24:00.329 --> 24:01.688
Take your time.

24:01.689 --> 24:03.208
Walk carefully.

24:03.209 --> 24:07.688
Forget about the lift, Kryten,
take the stairs... one at a time.

24:07.689 --> 24:10.208
He's just going to be a few minutes.

24:10.209 --> 24:11.889
What are you doing, Lister?

24:13.929 --> 24:17.328
Allow me to introduce you
to the crew, Professor Edgington.

24:17.329 --> 24:20.528
Oh, please, call me Irene...
or Professor E.

24:20.529 --> 24:22.608
This is Mr Rimmer.

24:22.609 --> 24:24.168
Mr Rimmer!

24:24.169 --> 24:26.888
I sense a special bond between us.

24:26.889 --> 24:29.969
I've always been attracted
to the brave, silent types.

24:31.529 --> 24:33.248
That's me, all right!

24:33.249 --> 24:36.248
I probably won't speak again
for hours,

24:36.249 --> 24:39.889
as I'll be off silently doing
something very brave.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.608
What a gorgeous bunk room.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.968
It's utterly enchanting.

24:46.969 --> 24:48.488
Enchanting?!

24:48.489 --> 24:49.928
Oh!

24:49.929 --> 24:52.088
Who plays the trumpet? Trumpet?

24:52.089 --> 24:53.728
It's a guitar case.

24:53.729 --> 24:55.888
Do any of you play? Yeah, I play.

24:55.889 --> 24:59.209
I bet you're absolutely brilliant.

25:00.449 --> 25:03.648
I thought she was supposed to be
wrong about everything, Kryten.

25:03.649 --> 25:06.808
Moving on to the matter in hand...

25:06.809 --> 25:09.849
Yeah, yeah, can you... help
me get out of this?

25:12.449 --> 25:13.608
There it is.

25:13.609 --> 25:15.368
It's a diagram.

25:15.369 --> 25:18.528
Five symbols. We have to turn them
off in the correct order.

25:18.529 --> 25:20.289
What happens if we choose
the wrong ones?

25:20.290 --> 25:22.289
Absolutely nothing.
It's all perfectly safe.

25:22.290 --> 25:24.048
Oh, God...

25:24.049 --> 25:26.808
Right, if you're going to explode,
it's not going to be in here.

25:26.809 --> 25:30.648
Oh, Protocol 121 - no exploding
in the drive room, right?

25:30.649 --> 25:33.088
Sir, perhaps best
if you stand in the corridor.

25:33.089 --> 25:35.448
Don't mess this up.
I'm relying on you, Kryten.

25:35.449 --> 25:37.729
Don't listen to a word she says.

25:39.889 --> 25:43.528
Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta.

25:43.529 --> 25:45.528
OK, ma'am, what's the first
one we turn off?

25:45.529 --> 25:47.528
Beta.

25:47.529 --> 25:48.808
Beta it is.

25:48.809 --> 25:50.368
No...

25:50.369 --> 25:52.168
alpha. No, beta.

25:52.169 --> 25:53.608
Beta or alpha.

25:53.609 --> 25:54.808
Or delta.

25:54.809 --> 25:56.448
No, it's definitely delta.

25:56.449 --> 25:57.889
Delta or gamma.

25:59.089 --> 26:02.728
The only one Professor E
hasn't mentioned is theta.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.729
First one - here it comes, sir -
theta.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.849
Next one - gamma.

26:12.169 --> 26:15.728
Definitely gamma, trust me.
Any other possibilities? No...

26:15.729 --> 26:17.888
No, gamma. It's definitely gamma.

26:17.889 --> 26:19.928
Just gamma. I'm certain it's gamma.

26:19.929 --> 26:21.209
Or maybe beta or alpha.

26:22.449 --> 26:25.649
Next one, sir, here we go - delta.

26:27.089 --> 26:29.368
Next - alpha, beta or gamma?

26:29.369 --> 26:30.928
Beta.

26:30.929 --> 26:32.168
Or gamma.

26:32.169 --> 26:33.368
Or beta.

26:33.369 --> 26:34.729
Alpha!

26:37.249 --> 26:39.448
Two more, sir, then we're there.

26:39.449 --> 26:44.008
Two more? My boots are full
of my own leg dribble.

26:44.009 --> 26:47.168
Professor? Call me Irene...
everyone does.

26:47.169 --> 26:50.608
Next wire - gamma or beta, ma'am?

26:50.609 --> 26:54.008
Beta, it's definitely beta. I'm not
going to change my mind this time.

26:54.009 --> 26:55.808
Beta. Beta.

26:55.809 --> 26:58.888
Beta. OK, gamma it is. Go for it.

26:58.889 --> 27:01.168
Wait a minute,
how about this for weird?

27:01.169 --> 27:04.368
Her name's Irene and her nickname is
Professor E.

27:04.369 --> 27:08.368
Put those names together
and you get Irene E.

27:08.369 --> 27:09.728
Irony.

27:09.729 --> 27:10.809
Wouldn't it be ironic

27:10.810 --> 27:15.088
if a professor known for being wrong
finally got something right?

27:15.089 --> 27:17.168
What do we do?

27:17.169 --> 27:20.929
Go for it. Go for beta.
Go for what she said.

27:45.209 --> 27:51.448
Oh, Arnold, you're everything I want
in a man - kind, clever, selfless.

27:51.449 --> 27:54.048
Don't forget amazing!

27:54.049 --> 27:56.408
Can I ask you a question?

27:56.409 --> 27:58.448
Do you think it would be wrong
for us

27:58.449 --> 28:01.369
to make love on our very first
evening together?

28:03.049 --> 28:04.889
Hmm, let me think.

28:06.209 --> 28:08.568
Well, Irene, on reflection,

28:08.569 --> 28:10.488
and I've given this much thought,

28:10.489 --> 28:12.248
I don't think it would.

28:12.249 --> 28:15.369
In fact, I think it would be
absolutely fine, tickety-boo
and peachy.

28:17.209 --> 28:19.128
Hiya.

28:19.129 --> 28:20.169
Come on.

28:24.489 --> 28:26.929
Don't touch the buttons!
Don't touch the buttons!

28:26.930 --> 28:28.729
Don't...!

28:30.289 --> 28:32.169
Oh...

28:33.249 --> 28:34.729
Oh...

28:40.289 --> 28:41.849
Have you got a pen?
