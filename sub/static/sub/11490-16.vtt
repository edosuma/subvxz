00:05.220 --> 00:10.510
It seems to me that it would be more fair if
everybody on both basketball teams was the same height.

00:11.990 --> 00:14.380
That's how it seems to you, huh?

00:14.390 --> 00:16.020
Yeah, like in boxing.

00:16.070 --> 00:17.470
Heavyweights fight heavyweights.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.840
Lightweights fight lightweights.

00:19.870 --> 00:24.260
So, in your world, everybody on a
basketball team would be, say, 6'5",

00:24.290 --> 00:26.870
and they'd only play
other teams that were 6'5".

00:26.910 --> 00:30.070
Exactly. That way, no one
would have an unfair advantage.

00:31.170 --> 00:32.759
That's very interesting.

00:32.780 --> 00:34.170
You really think so?

00:34.200 --> 00:38.550
No, but it's less likely to start a fight than
"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

00:39.270 --> 00:42.080
And yet, you said it anyway.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.750
Listen, I've got to talk
to you about something.

00:44.780 --> 00:47.560
Okay, "dumb" was a poor choice of words.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.720
It's not about that.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.110
Can it wait till halftime?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.080
No.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.410
I've got to go to a
funeral this weekend.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.130
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Who died?

00:57.140 --> 00:59.020
My
ex-mother-in-law.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.980
That couldn't wait till halftime?

01:00.990 --> 01:02.030
Charlie.

01:02.060 --> 01:05.280
I'm just saying she'll
still be dead at halftime.

01:06.390 --> 01:11.740
I was very close to her and I want to pay
my respects, so I'm going to Santa Barbara,

01:11.780 --> 01:15.330
and I'll be spending the
weekend with my ex-husband.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.020
Oh, okay.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.570
Define "with."

01:24.590 --> 01:27.340
Well, everyone's staying
at his parents' house.

01:27.370 --> 01:28.690
All right... well, do you
want me to come with you?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.930
- No.
- Great.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.630
- Why not?
- Do you want to come?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.380
Hell, no.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.810
That's what I figured.

01:41.820 --> 01:44.830
Look, I just want to
be up-front with you.

01:44.860 --> 01:48.620
I was married to Alex for eight years, and
I just don't want you to get the wrong idea.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.650
I wouldn't have had any idea if
you hadn't felt the need to tell me.

01:53.430 --> 01:56.460
Yeah, well, I don't want us to
have any secrets from each other.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.960
Oh, I agree. We definitely
should not have secrets.

01:58.970 --> 02:02.170
- Right.
- You know, from this point forward.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.540
What kind of guy is this Alex?

02:11.560 --> 02:15.520
He's a good guy. We just got married
too young and wanted different things.

02:15.530 --> 02:18.210
He wanted something
different than your things?

02:18.240 --> 02:21.070
'Cause your things are terrific.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.450
Thank you.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.310
He didn't go gay on you, did he?

02:29.550 --> 02:32.200
- No.
- Rats.

02:32.690 --> 02:36.640
- Are you jealous?
- No, no. Of course not.

02:37.550 --> 02:42.010
I mean, maybe a little. You know,
in the sense that his mother's dead.

03:15.980 --> 03:19.060
I miss you, too, honey.
How was the funeral?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.410
Yeah, I guess they're all pretty sad.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.900
Probably why they don't
call them fun-erals.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.690
Yeah, that was lame.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.250
So, where are you now, at the house?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.170
And where is your ex-husband?

03:35.180 --> 03:39.010
And where is his room
in relationship to yours?

03:39.020 --> 03:41.750
Hey, hey, it's got nothing
to do with jealousy.

03:41.790 --> 03:43.780
I just know, based on a
lifetime of experience,

03:43.790 --> 03:47.800
that penises do not observe
a traditional mourning period.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.970
Forget it, you are not driving my
car until you get a learner's permit.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.490
- Not even in the driveway?
- Not anywhere.

03:54.850 --> 03:56.980
What if you have a heart attack?
Can I drive you to the hospital?

03:56.990 --> 03:59.730
- No, call an ambulance.
- Fine.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.270
If they don't get here in
time, can I have your car?

04:06.710 --> 04:09.150
There's my posse. What
are we doing tonight, boys?

04:09.160 --> 04:11.490
Think big. It's my treat.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.890
- Drunk?
- Probably.

04:15.530 --> 04:16.820
Where is Chelsea?

04:16.860 --> 04:17.970
She had to go out of town.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.820
Oh, so your girlfriend's
gone for a couple of days.

04:20.870 --> 04:24.250
- Now, suddenly, you have time for us?
- Yeah.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.780
You ever think that maybe
Jake and I already have plans?

04:27.820 --> 04:30.420
That our lives go on even
when you're not around?

04:30.460 --> 04:33.380
That we don't just pop into
existence the moment you need us?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
I'm free.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.370
Me, too. I'm just making a point.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.750
So, what's it going to be? A movie,
bowling? Putt-putt, Nevada cathouse?

04:43.760 --> 04:45.750
I vote for cathouse.

04:45.790 --> 04:47.480
Do you even know what a cathouse is?

04:47.510 --> 04:50.670
Not firsthand. That's
why I voted for it.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.450
A movie would be fine.

04:57.480 --> 05:00.140
All right, a movie it is.
What's out that's good?

05:00.150 --> 05:03.440
There's a new pirate
movie. It's rated "Arr!"

05:07.720 --> 05:10.880
You guys have no sense of humor.

05:12.380 --> 05:16.790
Can we go to that new theater with the
reserved seats and the jumbo kosher hot dogs?

05:16.800 --> 05:18.140
You just finished dinner.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.630
That doesn't mean I finished eating.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.360
Hey, Charlie.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.260
Wanda... what are you doing here?

05:26.270 --> 05:29.660
I was in the neighborhood,
and I'm drunk and horny.

05:31.050 --> 05:33.460
New plan.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:42.550 --> 05:44.130
Have I met this one before?

05:44.170 --> 05:45.850
I doubt it.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.770
She looks familiar.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.830
Blond, bustyand bombed?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.380
Around here, that's familiar.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.100
I thought Uncle Charlie liked Chelsea.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.190
He does.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.330
Well, then, what's he doing with Wanda?

05:58.340 --> 05:59.980
Well, buddy, it's like this.

06:00.040 --> 06:06.110
Uh, despite his many admirable qualities,
your Uncle Charlie is, at heart, a sleazeball.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.600
That's what I figured. I
just wanted a second opinion.

06:09.610 --> 06:12.280
Hang on. I'll grab another bottle.

06:14.310 --> 06:17.270
Broad is part camel.

06:18.370 --> 06:21.450
Except the humps aren't on her back.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.090
Oh, come on. That was
funnier than "Rated arr!"

06:29.330 --> 06:32.510
Look, I know you're upset, but I'll
take you to the movies some other time.

06:32.550 --> 06:34.450
This has nothing to do with the movie.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.770
Then what's the problem?

06:35.790 --> 06:38.330
The problem is you're a sleazeball.

06:39.010 --> 06:40.530
Really? How so?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.900
Oh, please. You're in a committed
relationship with a wonderful woman,

06:43.910 --> 06:46.440
and the minute her back is
turned, you're out gallivanting.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.470
- Gallivanting?
- Screwing around.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.230
Then, why don't you just
say, "Screwing around"?

06:51.760 --> 06:55.610
Hey, as we speak, Chelsea is
doing the same thing I'm doing.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.560
Oh, really?

06:56.580 --> 06:59.460
She's pouring liquor down the
throat of an inebriated party girl?

06:59.480 --> 07:01.140
- Inebriated?
- Drunk.

07:01.150 --> 07:03.850
Geez, who are you showing off for?

07:06.010 --> 07:09.430
At this moment, Chelsea is in
the same house as her ex-husband.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.610
- Why?
- His mother died.

07:11.620 --> 07:15.340
Oh, my apologies. Clearly, anything
you do at this point is justified.

07:15.350 --> 07:17.700
- No, it's not.
- I was being disingenuous.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.680
- What?
- Sarcastic.

07:19.690 --> 07:23.220
You know, this is why Mom
gets pissed off at you so much.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.120
Look. Charlie, do what you want.

07:27.130 --> 07:29.520
If you can live with
yourself, more power to you.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.710
If I could live with myself, we'd be
having this conversation by telephone.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.740
See, him I understand.

07:37.730 --> 07:40.570
Charlie, bed, now, come.

07:41.370 --> 07:44.030
Succinct, ain't she?

07:45.170 --> 07:48.400
Does "succinct" mean
what I think it means?

07:48.880 --> 07:51.580
I highly doubt it.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.170
Hello?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.850
Right here, baby.

08:04.970 --> 08:07.860
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, why?

08:09.170 --> 08:12.810
Never mind. Come on. Come on.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.820
- Let's get you into bed.
- Thank you.

08:15.830 --> 08:20.650
Hey, you remember when we were in Vegas and
I talked that cute waitress into joining us?

08:20.660 --> 08:21.570
Yeah, I do.

08:21.610 --> 08:24.160
I saw her last week at the Hard Rock.

08:24.190 --> 08:26.870
- No kidding.
- She gained a lot of weight.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.650
- Is that so?
- Yeah, we were lucky.

08:29.660 --> 08:32.990
We nailed her right
before she quit smoking.

08:34.620 --> 08:35.640
Listen, Wanda, uh...

08:35.669 --> 08:37.919
She does smell better, though.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.770
- I'm sure, but listen...
- Like Fritos.

08:43.070 --> 08:47.470
You know what? I got
to... check on something.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.430
Well, is it okay if I start without you?

08:51.290 --> 08:54.720
Top drawer, nightstand--
take your pick.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.990
Careful. The big one's a flashlight.

09:02.020 --> 09:06.330
That was fast. I'm guesng.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.890
You're right. I'm a sleazeball.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.510
Don't tell me you actually
had a moral epiphany.

09:15.550 --> 09:18.070
- Uh, "epiphany" means...
- Don't bother.

09:22.090 --> 09:26.420
I don't know what you call it, but I've
got a gorgeous, willing girl in my bed,

09:26.430 --> 09:28.570
and I'm just not interested.

09:28.590 --> 09:31.240
Maybe you're a gay sleazeball.

09:32.920 --> 09:33.980
I'll tell you what's going on.

09:34.030 --> 09:38.760
You care about Chelsea too much to cheapen your
relationship with a meaningless one-night stand.

09:40.490 --> 09:44.660
You're right. I do care about
Chelsea. I'm crazy about her.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.870
Boy, that sucks.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.420
Hello. Oh, hey, Chelsea, we were just...

09:52.430 --> 09:54.650
Give me that.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.540
Hey, baby, what's going on?

09:57.560 --> 10:00.830
He did? At his own mother's funeral?

10:00.840 --> 10:03.650
Her ex-husband put the moves on her.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.950
What a sleazeball.

10:07.450 --> 10:11.580
No, no, no, don't blame yourself.
You were right to go to the funeral.

10:12.620 --> 10:15.340
Tonight?

10:15.370 --> 10:18.600
I'd love to see you tonight, but...

10:18.630 --> 10:22.740
isn't it a little late to drive
all the way from Santa Barbara?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.580
Oh, you're already on the road.

10:25.610 --> 10:27.780
Oh, that close?

10:27.790 --> 10:32.120
Wonderful. Drive safe.

10:32.750 --> 10:38.170
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

10:38.180 --> 10:42.440
Remember when I was little and every time someone
said "crap", ey had to put a dollar in the swear jar?

10:42.450 --> 10:43.890
I do.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.050
Whatever happened to all that money?

10:48.090 --> 10:51.880
Wanda, I don't want you to take this the wrong
way, but you got to get the hell out of here.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.310
Come on. Chop-chop.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.510
Wanda?

11:01.770 --> 11:04.360
Wanda...

11:14.480 --> 11:16.770
Oh, darn.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.080
So the car's a time machine?

11:24.110 --> 11:27.420
Yeah, it's called a DeLorean.
They don't make 'em anymore.

11:27.430 --> 11:31.550
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap. Help.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.560
- I need help. - Oh, my God,
w-what happened? What's wrong?

11:33.570 --> 11:36.300
Wanda passed out and
Chelsea's on her way over.

11:36.330 --> 11:39.040
Interesting story about the DeLorean.

11:39.570 --> 11:43.950
- It was built by a man named John DeLorean.
- Are you not listening to me? I've got an emergency here.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.040
A dead girl in your bed is an emergency.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.740
A passed-out girl is a dinner date.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.520
I still don't understand why
it's called Back to the Future.

11:52.550 --> 11:55.690
Because they're stuck in the
past, and they have to get back...

11:55.700 --> 11:57.910
Home.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.110
Oh, for God's sake, come on!

12:01.160 --> 12:04.050
My girlfriend's on her way over, and
I've got a half-naked broad upstairs!

12:04.080 --> 12:06.460
Half-naked. I'm your man.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.090
Sit down.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.670
Have you tried waking her up?

12:12.700 --> 12:16.500
Well, of course I've tried waking her
up. This is not my first unk bimbo!

12:16.810 --> 12:18.140
So, what do you expect us to do?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.490
I expect you to help me get
her dressed and drive her home.

12:20.530 --> 12:22.920
Enough talk. Let's get to it.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.420
I said, sit down.

12:26.460 --> 12:27.510
Where does she live?

12:27.540 --> 12:28.500
I have no idea.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.910
So, how am I supposed to drive her home?

12:29.940 --> 12:33.160
Oh, come on. Do I have to think
of everything? Just help me!

12:33.170 --> 12:35.530
All right.

12:46.130 --> 12:48.580
Oh, and I'm a sleazeball?

12:48.590 --> 12:50.590
You're-You're
misreading my-my "wow."

12:50.630 --> 12:55.010
I meant "Wow, what a predicament."

12:55.020 --> 12:58.640
Yeah, right. You hold her
up. I'll put her dress on.

12:58.650 --> 13:02.600
Okay. She's very fit.

13:03.310 --> 13:06.410
- Hold her arms up.
- Really soft skin.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.550
Smells nice, too.

13:09.590 --> 13:12.540
Okay, why don't you just put a
chloroform-soaked handkerchief over her face

13:12.580 --> 13:15.360
and throw her in the
back of your panel van?

13:16.350 --> 13:19.470
Sounds like a waste of
chloroform, doesn it?

13:22.320 --> 13:24.300
Okay, you get her
head; I'll get her feet.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.790
Why do you get her feet?

13:25.810 --> 13:28.570
- What difference does it make?
- I like feet.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.530
Just get her head.

13:32.350 --> 13:37.540
Okay, on three. One, two, three.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.350
Goodness.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.280
Slowly, slowly.

13:42.290 --> 13:43.600
Slowly, my ass. Come on.

13:43.610 --> 13:46.110
- Let's get her out of here.
- Charlie. Charlie...

13:47.770 --> 13:51.360
Goodness gracious, these are real.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.570
Slowly. Slowly.

14:02.390 --> 14:06.930
Quickly. Quickly.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.010
Hi, baby. Come on in.

14:11.370 --> 14:14.940
Oh, Charlie, you were
so right about Alex.

14:17.180 --> 14:18.950
Alex?

14:18.980 --> 14:22.090
Oh, yeah. Alex. What a sleazeball.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.230
Can I get you something to drink?

14:23.260 --> 14:25.350
No. I just want to get
in bed and hold you.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.090
Oh, boy, does that sound good.

14:27.110 --> 14:29.780
- Leme just say good night to Jake.
- Okay. I'll meet you upstai.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.720
You know what? Why don't
you come say good night, too?

14:33.730 --> 14:34.800
Why?

14:34.840 --> 14:39.080
Well, you're my girlfriend,
and he's my nephew, and...

14:39.370 --> 14:41.930
isn't that enough?

14:42.120 --> 14:43.010
Hey, Jake...

14:43.040 --> 14:46.470
Might want to hang back a sec.
I just ripped off an air biscuit.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.770
- What?
- I farted.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.810
Sorry. I get the fancy
words from my dad.

14:53.150 --> 14:55.480
Anyway, Chelsea and I just
wanted to say good night.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.500
Okay.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.190
He keeps his feelings bottled up.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.790
Everything else he shoots
into the atmosphere.

15:02.190 --> 15:03.560
- Hi, Chelsea.
- Hi, Alan.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.200
Uh, sorry to hear about
your ex-mother-in-law.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.110
Oh, thank you.

15:06.140 --> 15:08.220
Oh, hey, Jake. I could
really use your help.

15:08.230 --> 15:10.740
- With what?
- I'm taking out the...

15:13.520 --> 15:15.300
I'm taking out the trash.

15:15.330 --> 15:17.480
What are you talking about?

15:17.520 --> 15:18.890
The trash.

15:18.910 --> 15:23.180
I'm taking it out, and I could
use your help carrying it.

15:23.710 --> 15:25.510
So now you want my help?

15:25.540 --> 15:27.480
Yes, now I want your help.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.230
What about the 20 bucks you owe me?

15:31.290 --> 15:33.580
Charlie?

15:36.050 --> 15:37.480
Here.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.410
Is the trash still out
where you can see it?

15:41.400 --> 15:44.430
Never mind. Just go help your father.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.460
Fine.

15:45.470 --> 15:47.980
- Nice seeing you, Chelsea.
- Good night.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.660
I could have said 50, couldn't I?

15:50.670 --> 15:53.130
Could have said a hundred.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.750
Can we please go to bed now?

15:55.790 --> 15:59.010
- Beds are for amateurs.
- Oh, Charlie.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.620
What if Jake comes back?

16:07.640 --> 16:10.750
We'll breathe through our mouths.

16:16.390 --> 16:18.200
She really does look familiar.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.780
Terrific.Just don't drop he

16:19.790 --> 16:22.260
I can't wait to tell
my friends about this.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.150
You're not telling anybody about this.

16:24.190 --> 16:27.090
What's the point of doing
it if I can't tell anybody?

16:27.120 --> 16:30.220
You've got 20 bucks and
a memory. Now shut up.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.860
Okay, we've got to get her in the car.

16:32.890 --> 16:33.650
You want me to pull it around?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.470
No, I don't want you to pull it around!

16:35.510 --> 16:38.880
Okay, well, then, you pull it
around, I'll stay here with her.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.800
But be very careful.

16:42.010 --> 16:44.200
Come on, let's finish this upstairs.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.770
Move, move, move!

16:48.710 --> 16:50.830
- Chelsea, wait.
- What?

16:51.320 --> 16:53.950
I'm so happy you're back.

16:56.830 --> 17:00.140
Oh, hey, Alan. Is the trash out?

17:00.150 --> 17:01.920
Uh, almost.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.550
Almost ain't gonna cut it.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.569
Did you at least clean out my room?

17:08.849 --> 17:11.940
- Yes, I did.
- Good. Good.

17:11.950 --> 17:13.480
Okay, well, good night.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.230
Uh, Charlie, can I
talk to you for a sec?

17:16.240 --> 17:19.150
- About what?
- uh, recycling.

17:19.160 --> 17:24.010
I'm not quite sure what
to do with the... big jugs.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.510
Honey, why don't you go up and get
comfortable, and I'll be right there?

17:29.520 --> 17:31.520
- Hurry.
- I will.

17:31.530 --> 17:34.200
Okay, first you need to separate
the plastic from the glass.

17:34.230 --> 17:36.890
Then when you get to the newspaper...
What the hell is your problem?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.460
Shs in Jake's room.
What am I supposed to do?

17:39.470 --> 17:41.590
I don't know.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.650
Here's my credit card. Take
her to a hol or something.

17:44.660 --> 17:47.290
Okay. Chain motel or someplace nicer?

17:47.490 --> 17:48.430
What?

17:48.470 --> 17:50.510
You know, uh, room service, ocean view.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.690
That way when she regains
consciousness, she won't feel so cheap.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.850
Plus, in the nicer places, you
have a free continental breakfast.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.520
Assorted pastries, coffee,
freshly squeezed orange juice...

17:59.560 --> 18:02.320
I know what a continental breakfast is!

18:02.350 --> 18:05.390
- Just get her the hell out of here!
- Okay, fine.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.530
- Oh, Charlie?
- What?

18:08.540 --> 18:10.060
I'm a little low on gas.

18:10.070 --> 18:12.820
- Use the card!
- Right, right, right.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.010
- Charlie?
- What?

18:16.020 --> 18:18.260
I'm really happy you're trying
to make it work with Chelsea.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.420
Go!

18:28.210 --> 18:30.000
What the hell are you doing?

18:30.030 --> 18:32.780
You said I could have
a memory. This is it.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.520
Give me the phone.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.610
Oh, good idea. I can't
get us both in the frame.

18:38.790 --> 18:41.750
Can you make it look like
we're talking to each other?

18:41.790 --> 18:43.840
Forget the picture. We have
to bring the car around.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.360
Shouldn't someone stay here with Wanda?

18:45.410 --> 18:47.980
Yeah, but it shouldn't be you.

18:52.110 --> 18:53.690
- Give me the keys.
- You said I could pull it around.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.990
I changed my mind.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.850
Okay. I'll tell Mom about Wanda.

19:02.650 --> 19:05.740
One ding, one scratch, and you're dead.

19:05.750 --> 19:09.080
Dude, mellow out. You'll
give yourself a heart attack.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.540
Hey, look! It's me!

19:24.090 --> 19:26.210
I'm glad you came back.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.840
I don't like it when you're gone.

19:27.870 --> 19:30.520
I don't like it when I'm gone, either.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.440
Here they are.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.090
Funny story.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.450
