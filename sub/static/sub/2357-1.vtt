00:27.360 --> 00:31.126
Daddy, what's the greatest thing
you ever saw?

00:32.164 --> 00:34.758
The greatest thing that I ever saw.

00:38.704 --> 00:40.899
One time, when I was a little boy...

00:41.707 --> 00:45.268
...I was playing with my slingshot,
and I saw this jaybird.

00:46.779 --> 00:48.644
I don't know why, but I shot him.

00:48.814 --> 00:51.305
You killed a birdie?

00:51.851 --> 00:53.785
I didn't mean to.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.212
I don't even know why I shot at him,
but I felt so bad.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.587
Then I started praying to God
that he would come back.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.728
And all of a sudden,
the jaybird woke up.

01:02.895 --> 01:05.522
He just... He just flew away.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.290
God saved him?

01:08.467 --> 01:10.560
Yeah, I think so.

01:11.303 --> 01:12.327
Hey, Katie.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.599
Bedtime.

01:18.277 --> 01:21.508
Why does it always
have to be bedtime?

01:23.749 --> 01:25.649
I'll race you inside.

01:38.564 --> 01:40.395
December 18th.

01:41.634 --> 01:43.659
Your last day.

01:45.171 --> 01:46.536
No more parole.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.774
I'm a free man.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.405
It seems like so long ago.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.245
So...

01:58.350 --> 01:59.977
You wanna celebrate?

02:22.975 --> 02:25.409
You got problems. Issues, man.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.103
Come on, today's a good day.
I'm celebrating something.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.373
So no problems today
and definitely no issues.

02:30.549 --> 02:32.847
Sorry to bust up your fantasy world,
Cinderella...

02:33.018 --> 02:36.249
...but our 5:00 just took a nose-dive
into the Dallas river.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.287
We lost a thousand cases.

02:38.924 --> 02:41.324
- All right, call in a four-shift.
- Okay.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.554
Have them pull a swing. I want another
truck loaded and off by 11.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.129
All right?

02:48.601 --> 02:50.193
Yeah?

02:51.470 --> 02:54.405
- Did you hear about the 5:00?
- Yeah.

02:54.573 --> 02:56.404
Hell, if it ain't always something,
huh?

02:56.575 --> 02:58.270
We'll make up for it by tomorrow.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.638
How's the driver?

02:59.812 --> 03:03.270
Broken leg.
Passerby pulled him out.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.644
Who says
there's no more heroes, huh?

03:06.919 --> 03:08.409
How's your little girl?

03:08.587 --> 03:11.181
She's good. She's an angel.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.291
Love every moment.

03:13.459 --> 03:14.858
It kills you when they leave.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.693
I'll call the driver's wife.

03:17.863 --> 03:19.694
- Ben.
- Yeah.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.564
You're doing a great job.

03:23.569 --> 03:24.934
Thanks.

03:26.071 --> 03:28.631
I can schedule the classes
around Katie's school.

03:28.808 --> 03:33.404
And if I score over 80 on the test,
RealTops guarantees me a job.

03:33.579 --> 03:35.171
How much is the class?

03:36.682 --> 03:37.740
It's $ 1100.

03:42.621 --> 03:44.885
This could be really good for us.

03:45.691 --> 03:47.158
I can make money selling homes.

03:47.326 --> 03:49.920
Enough that we can move out
of the city, on a lake.

03:50.095 --> 03:53.189
- But Dallas isn't that bad, come on.
- I know.

03:53.632 --> 03:55.998
There's a RealTops office
in Marietta.

03:56.168 --> 03:57.499
When that brewery opens...

03:57.670 --> 03:59.501
But they haven't offered me
the job yet.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.537
Yeah, but they will.
Danny trusts you.

04:01.707 --> 04:03.675
He'll want you running that place.

04:05.144 --> 04:07.237
You really wanna live
in the country, huh?

04:09.949 --> 04:13.817
It'd be nice to look out the window and
see something other than concrete.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.886
I like the country too.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.534
- Why, you mother... You mother...
- Watch your mouth.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.729
You know how Dad felt about cussing.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.375
- They let you out early?
- They can't keep you forever.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.601
Not on burglary, anyway.

05:13.078 --> 05:16.775
- Good to see you, big brother.
- It's good to see you, okay?

05:19.318 --> 05:21.377
Hey, Lisa.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.452
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.153
Good to see you too.

05:28.327 --> 05:31.091
Look at you.
Prettiest little girl on planet Earth.

05:31.263 --> 05:34.391
- Katie, this is your uncle Ricky.
- I've seen your picture.

05:34.566 --> 05:36.261
That's funny, that's really funny...

05:36.435 --> 05:40.098
...because I got a picture of you
in my wallet.

05:42.641 --> 05:44.734
How long are you in town for?

05:45.377 --> 05:47.004
I don't know.

05:48.113 --> 05:50.172
I gotta get her to bed.

05:50.749 --> 05:53.309
- I love you, baby.
- Hey, it's good to see you. It's...

05:53.485 --> 05:55.009
Yeah.

06:01.894 --> 06:04.590
I'm sorry I couldn't come visit you.

06:04.763 --> 06:07.163
Florida's a long drive.

06:07.333 --> 06:11.292
And jail ain't a place
for your little angel.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.366
She's beautiful, Ben.

06:15.841 --> 06:19.208
Hey, Ricky,
there's blankets in the closet.

06:19.378 --> 06:22.211
Thanks, but I got a room.
I didn't wanna impose.

06:23.148 --> 06:25.082
All right, I'm going to bed.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.775
You boys
don't drink yourself stupid.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.545
Good night.

06:35.494 --> 06:36.654
How's Marilyn?

06:40.699 --> 06:42.360
She's not a part of my life anymore.

06:42.534 --> 06:44.729
I got something.
I got something good.

06:48.273 --> 06:52.107
Supercomputers.
Ones like the military uses.

06:52.277 --> 06:54.677
The internals, wiring and switches...

06:54.847 --> 06:59.284
...all custom-made,
lined with a common conductor.

06:59.885 --> 07:01.113
Gold.

07:01.286 --> 07:02.981
I'm not talking gold bars.

07:03.155 --> 07:07.888
I'm talking something so low-profile,
a rent-a-cop watches the place.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.518
Dust. Gold dust.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.062
Untraceable.
The lab stocks 30 pounds of it.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.065
You can carry that out
with a knapsack.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.567
All I need is a dialer.

07:19.938 --> 07:21.838
Look, Ricky.

07:23.909 --> 07:27.902
Every day I was inside,
all I could think about was my family.

07:30.482 --> 07:33.849
You know that Katie was 3 years old
when I got out?

07:34.019 --> 07:35.145
Three years old.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.289
And she didn't even know
who the hell I was.

07:40.492 --> 07:42.790
I can't go back in.

07:47.399 --> 07:50.300
You ever think
about what we'd be doing...

07:50.469 --> 07:52.937
...if Dad hadn't killed himself?

07:56.208 --> 07:58.005
All the time.

08:03.582 --> 08:06.107
I'm heading to Utah Sunday.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.544
Till then, I'm at the Six Days Inn.

08:11.356 --> 08:13.187
Don't be stupid, Ricky.

08:13.358 --> 08:15.952
You're out. Stay out.

08:16.995 --> 08:18.758
If you change your mind, call me.

08:18.931 --> 08:22.423
I'm calling you no matter what,
but I'm not changing my mind.

08:23.435 --> 08:25.801
- I love you.
- You too.

08:29.174 --> 08:30.505
Dad?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.871
Ben.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.279
Damn it, Ben.

08:37.448 --> 08:41.317
Don't smoke in bed.
You're gonna burn this place down.

08:44.723 --> 08:46.657
Are you okay?

08:47.359 --> 08:50.954
I am fine.
I just had another bad dream.

08:54.766 --> 08:56.757
I'm sorry.

08:58.303 --> 09:00.498
May I see? Are you all right?

09:03.575 --> 09:05.475
You're all right.

09:12.084 --> 09:13.574
What did Ricky want?

09:13.752 --> 09:15.049
He just wanted to say hi.

09:18.323 --> 09:20.553
Other side. Okay?

09:20.726 --> 09:23.194
- Stop it, Daddy.
- One more, one more.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.027
Love you, guys.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.165
Yeah.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.537
Joey said you wanted to talk to me.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.331
Yeah, sit down, Ben.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.878
Well, this must be serious.

09:47.052 --> 09:50.112
It seems like we mostly talk
with my head poking through the door.

09:50.289 --> 09:54.487
Yeah, that's true.
I mean, that's... That's how we talk.

09:57.696 --> 09:59.630
You upset with me, Danny?

09:59.798 --> 10:01.561
Oh, God, no, Ben.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.159
You're one of the good ones.

10:05.637 --> 10:09.300
That's what's making
this position I'm in...

10:09.975 --> 10:12.136
Well, it's making me sick.

10:14.646 --> 10:16.705
I gotta let you go.

10:19.117 --> 10:22.518
I put you in
to run the new place in Marietta.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.921
The owners
did a background check.

10:26.325 --> 10:29.419
- Your record came up.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.

10:29.595 --> 10:32.758
Hell, I don't care
what you did in the past, Ben.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.930
I've made some bad choices
in my life too.

10:36.101 --> 10:39.559
Yeah, well, then talk to them, Danny.
Tell them I'm not the same man.

10:39.738 --> 10:42.298
I have talked to them, Ben.

10:43.642 --> 10:46.167
Hell, they wanted you gone
three weeks ago.

10:51.350 --> 10:54.114
Danny, this job is everything to me.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.346
I'm sorry.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.345
Hi.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.078
Hey.

11:32.491 --> 11:35.654
- I see you got your books already.
- Yeah.

11:35.827 --> 11:40.264
All I gotta do is study for five months
and we are home free.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.463
You okay?

11:44.636 --> 11:46.866
Yeah, I'm all right, just...

11:47.039 --> 11:50.440
I'm... I'm tired.
I'm just gonna lay down.

12:31.049 --> 12:32.710
Yeah.

12:32.884 --> 12:34.715
Tomorrow night.

12:37.856 --> 12:39.949
Why did you change your mind?

12:40.459 --> 12:42.791
Life changed it for me.

12:52.804 --> 12:54.795
Just get in the back.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.869
Hey, give us a second.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.879
Ready?

13:06.918 --> 13:08.715
Who in the hell is that?

13:09.287 --> 13:11.983
His name is Phelps.
And he's the one that gave me the tip.

13:12.157 --> 13:13.749
We were inside together.

13:14.192 --> 13:17.184
He's okay, man.
He's just an extra pair of eyes, is all.

13:17.362 --> 13:19.125
You didn't tell me about Phelps,
Ricky.

13:19.297 --> 13:21.765
I didn't tell you,
because I knew how you'd react...

13:21.933 --> 13:23.400
...and I need you.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.668
No, I can't do this.

13:26.838 --> 13:29.932
Period. Tell him.
Let's get the hell out of here.

13:36.314 --> 13:37.838
Ben...

13:40.452 --> 13:43.853
Phelps, he works for someone.

13:45.190 --> 13:48.023
A guy I owe a lot of money to.

13:49.761 --> 13:51.752
And they...

13:52.764 --> 13:56.222
They want their money now. Tonight.
And they're not the kind of people...

13:56.401 --> 13:59.268
...who would understand
why it didn't happen tonight.

14:01.973 --> 14:05.136
They're gonna kill me, Ben.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.058
Let's go.

14:41.079 --> 14:42.740
Hold this.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.746
Come on, man. It's cool, man.

14:47.919 --> 14:51.753
Ricky told me. No guns. I know.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.320
You'll do as you're told.

15:12.577 --> 15:15.011
- What's with all the colored ones?
- Watch this.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.841
Yellow's video.

15:17.015 --> 15:20.109
Red's audio.
Green is the alarm companies.

15:20.285 --> 15:22.116
Most of the others are dummies.

15:27.025 --> 15:28.458
All right.

15:34.299 --> 15:36.563
All right, five minutes
until the alarm company...

15:36.735 --> 15:38.293
...knows they have crossed wires.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.562
It means we have three.

15:42.641 --> 15:43.665
- Ready?
- Yeah, ready.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.332
Let's go.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.210
All right.

15:57.622 --> 15:59.590
Almost looks real.

16:01.726 --> 16:03.489
All right,
you know what you're doing.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.358
Make sure no one surprises.
We're going straight in. Ready?

16:06.531 --> 16:07.759
Let's go.

16:09.968 --> 16:13.301
Touch that thing and we all go
boom-boom. Show me your hands.

16:13.471 --> 16:15.132
You, right there.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.172
Come with me.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:17.342 --> 16:19.003
Let's go.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.536
Get out of here, come on.
Come on, let's go.

16:21.713 --> 16:22.737
Let's go, let's go.

16:22.914 --> 16:24.575
Come on, come on.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.311
Let's go.
Let's go take a walk. Come on.

16:28.119 --> 16:30.644
Come on. Over here.

16:30.822 --> 16:32.517
All right? Sit right here.

16:33.358 --> 16:36.293
Don't move. Don't move.

16:38.763 --> 16:40.458
Relax. Calm down.

16:41.766 --> 16:44.860
Sit tight.
It's gonna be a happy ending, okay?

16:45.036 --> 16:46.298
Capiche?

16:52.110 --> 16:53.839
Okay.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.610
What the hell is taking him so long?

16:57.782 --> 17:01.013
- It's been 30 seconds. Calm down.
- All right.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.183
Cool. Everybody's cool, right?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.828
Everybody's cool.

17:41.926 --> 17:42.950
Hey, don't. Don't.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.686
- What are you doing?
- Don't do it.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.990
His ankle. His ankle.

17:47.165 --> 17:49.360
- Show me your hands.
- Police. Drop your weapons.

18:21.232 --> 18:23.962
Ben Garvey, please rise.

18:31.876 --> 18:36.006
We, the jury, duly impaneled
in the above entitled action...

18:36.181 --> 18:40.618
...find the defendant,
Ben Garvey, guilty.

18:46.057 --> 18:47.524
Because you committed a crime...

18:47.692 --> 18:50.593
...that lead directly
to the deaths of three people...

18:50.762 --> 18:55.495
...the jury has found you guilty
of three counts of capital murder.

18:58.369 --> 19:01.270
I hereby sentence you
to Beaumont Supermax...

19:01.439 --> 19:04.408
...where you will await execution.

19:05.243 --> 19:08.303
May God have mercy on your soul.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.186
State Supreme Court refused it.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.533
I'm not a killer.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.334
You were there
during the commission of a crime.

19:33.204 --> 19:34.228
This is Texas.

19:34.405 --> 19:38.102
In the eyes of the law, you might
as well have shot them yourself.

19:39.444 --> 19:43.107
Ben,
they're moving real fast on this.

19:43.281 --> 19:45.613
You need to prepare yourself.

19:48.319 --> 19:52.779
And then Wendy told Mrs. Jamison,
so I hit her in the face.

19:53.124 --> 19:54.887
You know that was wrong,
don't you?

19:55.059 --> 19:57.550
Yeah, but she deserved it.
She broke a promise.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.260
Yeah, but no more hitting.

20:04.435 --> 20:06.300
No matter what, okay?

20:06.471 --> 20:07.733
Okay.

20:09.307 --> 20:11.707
Daddy, when are you
gonna come back home?

20:19.184 --> 20:20.845
You know I love you
and your mommy...

20:21.019 --> 20:23.146
...more than anything else
in the world, right?

20:24.055 --> 20:25.545
Yeah.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.849
Well...

20:30.261 --> 20:32.525
I did something real bad.

20:32.864 --> 20:33.888
Come on, take your walk.

20:34.065 --> 20:36.226
Something I didn't mean to do.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.732
Like the jaybird?

20:43.608 --> 20:45.599
Yeah, like the jaybird.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.451
So Daddy's gotta go away
for a really long time.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.584
Do you have to go?

21:01.359 --> 21:02.383
Yeah, I have to.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.377
When are you gonna come back?

21:31.055 --> 21:33.080
I'm not coming back.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.389
I can't come back.

21:38.663 --> 21:41.029
Daddy will always love you.

23:03.381 --> 23:05.508
You headed for Mount Angel?

23:05.683 --> 23:08.516
Rain's gonna start up again.
Jump in. I'll give you a ride.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.753
Constant rain showers
this time of year.

23:20.531 --> 23:22.089
Like clockwork.

23:22.266 --> 23:25.030
Sun, rain, sun, rain.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.404
I'm assuming
you're the new groundskeeper?

23:31.876 --> 23:33.844
Yeah.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.947
Well, how do you like it so far?

23:37.915 --> 23:39.439
What's happening to me?

23:41.352 --> 23:42.979
It's quiet.

23:43.321 --> 23:45.152
Quiet is why the order came here.

23:45.323 --> 23:48.656
It's good for priests.
Not to mention the patients.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.832
Groundskeeper's office
is at the end of the main hall.

24:03.007 --> 24:05.771
Let me park,
and I'll give you the tour.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.632
You have been given
a second chance.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.187
I wanna go home.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.542
Tapalamaho
is what the Indians called this plateau.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.680
They'd come here to pray.

25:49.847 --> 25:51.576
Then, 200 years ago,
the order came...

25:51.749 --> 25:55.913
...built this place
and started praying too.

25:56.087 --> 25:59.523
I guess if it's good enough for the
Indians, it's good enough for priests.

25:59.690 --> 26:02.557
Chapel's off the east wing.
I'll show it to you.

26:05.997 --> 26:08.431
The stained glass needs
to be cleaned every month.

26:08.599 --> 26:12.399
The chapel itself, once a week.
Fridays are good.

26:12.837 --> 26:16.705
The last groundskeeper left things
in a bit of a mess.

26:16.874 --> 26:19.001
Unexpected departure.

26:23.781 --> 26:27.979
The chapel was the first building
put up, and all the pipes run from it.

26:28.152 --> 26:31.144
Most plumbing problems
will start here.

26:35.993 --> 26:37.790
Oh, it's the old priest rectory.

26:37.962 --> 26:40.522
It's closed up. Water damage.

26:42.133 --> 26:44.567
This tunnel connects
all five buildings.

26:44.735 --> 26:46.965
Its not used for much anymore.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.038
But I think the first priests hid here...

26:49.207 --> 26:51.266
...when the natives got restless.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.141
There's no going back, Ben.

27:01.686 --> 27:03.620
If you need help, use Robbie.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.382
Working on the grounds
is good therapy for him.

27:06.557 --> 27:08.491
He likes to be needed.

27:08.659 --> 27:10.786
Well, she's all yours.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.490
How are you adjusting?

28:23.267 --> 28:25.735
It can be difficult at first.

28:26.537 --> 28:28.402
It becomes easier.

28:31.108 --> 28:33.269
Do you remember my name?

28:36.447 --> 28:37.937
Avery.

28:45.022 --> 28:46.580
Where am I?

28:49.427 --> 28:51.395
This is Oregon.

29:11.682 --> 29:13.377
I'm alive.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.681
What does that make you, then?

29:21.125 --> 29:23.059
A guide.

29:27.298 --> 29:29.425
I don't want any of this.

29:31.869 --> 29:34.861
I wanna be back
with my wife and my daughter.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.375
Can I please leave?

29:43.514 --> 29:46.608
You've made a selfish choice, Ben.

29:46.784 --> 29:49.378
Men died that day.

29:49.887 --> 29:51.047
There's a price to pay.

29:51.789 --> 29:55.350
You cannot see them again
in this life.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.328
It was an accident.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.760
It was a horrible accident.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.729
Ben, listen to me.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.700
The rules are simple.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.237
This is a second chance.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.139
Now, if you deny it...

30:11.308 --> 30:14.971
...you've damned yourself
to an eternity without Lisa and Katie.

30:16.180 --> 30:20.446
Outside of this town,
the only thing waiting for you is death.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.820
Accept this new life.

30:33.864 --> 30:35.331
What if I can't?

30:38.235 --> 30:39.896
You will.

30:40.404 --> 30:43.635
Only a fool spits in the face of God.

31:00.057 --> 31:01.991
I'm not crazy.

31:03.961 --> 31:06.327
People think
just because you're here...

31:06.497 --> 31:08.727
...means you're crazy.

31:15.339 --> 31:17.807
I did high school in Portland.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.240
I didn't like it.

31:21.178 --> 31:23.169
I wanted to go to college after...

31:23.347 --> 31:26.544
...but my dad wanted me
to join the Army.

31:27.551 --> 31:29.951
He thought it would make me tough.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.047
Do you like your dad?

31:36.694 --> 31:38.093
Yeah.

31:39.530 --> 31:41.020
He live in Oregon?

31:42.533 --> 31:44.728
He died when I was a kid.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.098
That's sad.

31:56.146 --> 31:57.511
People are watching us.

31:59.116 --> 32:00.913
I don't know who they are.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.985
They're always watching.

32:06.023 --> 32:07.888
Do you think I'm crazy?

32:10.594 --> 32:12.926
No. I don't think you're crazy.

32:34.218 --> 32:35.776
Watch his hand.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.288
Why did you stop me?

32:40.958 --> 32:42.220
Why did you stop me?

32:43.160 --> 32:45.788
Why did you stop me?

33:23.767 --> 33:26.327
Why'd you do it, Ben?

33:48.726 --> 33:50.660
PGE operator. Can I help you?

33:50.828 --> 33:53.092
Yes, I need a number, please.

33:53.597 --> 33:55.224
Lisa Garvey in Dallas, Texas.

33:55.399 --> 33:56.798
Hold on, please.

34:00.471 --> 34:03.634
I'm sorry, sir.
There is no such listing.

34:26.362 --> 34:27.387
Priest Andari.

34:29.667 --> 34:32.362
They're copies
of his most famous works.

34:33.904 --> 34:35.268
Hi.

34:35.906 --> 34:38.806
I'm Julie Ingram.
I'm one of the counselors here.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.178
You are the new groundskeeper?

34:42.346 --> 34:43.404
Ben.

34:47.184 --> 34:50.915
They were etched by the Mount's
founding priest, Isaac Fowler.

34:52.322 --> 34:57.259
They've faded a bit,
but this is a nice place to think.

34:58.362 --> 34:59.727
I'll come back later.

34:59.897 --> 35:02.559
No. No, it's okay.

35:03.667 --> 35:05.498
I'm done thinking.

35:07.337 --> 35:08.599
Hey.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.538
Welcome to Mount Angel.

35:27.624 --> 35:29.785
Why did you stop me?

35:30.394 --> 35:32.453
It was an accident.

35:32.629 --> 35:34.824
There are no accidents.

35:34.998 --> 35:38.456
There are only thing things we do and
what those things do to other people.

35:38.635 --> 35:40.569
William.

35:40.738 --> 35:42.103
Let him go.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.141
You're just like me.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.721
This is Building Number 5.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.757
It's where we keep patients
who can't be controlled.

36:02.926 --> 36:04.951
It's best to steer clear of it.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.147
You new?

36:34.758 --> 36:36.692
Around here, I mean.

36:36.860 --> 36:38.088
Yeah.

36:38.262 --> 36:41.754
There's not a lot to do in Dundee,
but it's an all right place.

36:42.499 --> 36:44.057
Can I get you anything else?

36:50.541 --> 36:52.532
I'll just take the check.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.038
Go away.

38:25.202 --> 38:26.726
Get out of here.

38:53.463 --> 38:55.488
Go home, dog.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.133
You're not getting in here.

38:57.301 --> 38:58.928
Go home.

39:04.241 --> 39:07.870
People have been drawing
with charcoal for thousands of years.

39:08.946 --> 39:11.540
There are these caves in France...

39:12.616 --> 39:14.675
...Lascaux, I think...

39:15.218 --> 39:17.413
...where they found these
from the Stone Age...

39:17.587 --> 39:19.248
...all done in charcoal.

39:19.423 --> 39:22.483
Deer, bison, horses.

39:25.929 --> 39:27.328
Even one of you.

40:49.346 --> 40:52.474
Hi. I'm Lisa Madison,
and I've been selling homes here...

40:52.649 --> 40:55.447
...in the Marietta, Powder Springs
area for over a year now.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.654
I know the area and the people...

40:58.822 --> 41:00.255
...like the back of my hand.

41:00.424 --> 41:03.757
Why? Because I live here
with my daughter.

41:03.927 --> 41:06.122
This is my house and my dream.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.492
RealTops made it possible for me...

41:08.665 --> 41:11.156
...and I can make it
possible for you.

41:11.668 --> 41:13.226
Bye.

41:22.546 --> 41:23.911
So, what's in Texas?

41:24.648 --> 41:26.081
Home.

41:26.249 --> 41:28.683
Bus will be along in about an hour.

42:50.867 --> 42:53.427
This bus is not for you, Ben.

42:53.970 --> 42:55.665
You don't wanna be on it.

42:56.973 --> 42:59.100
You need to let go.

43:00.076 --> 43:02.306
Stop thinking about what you had.

43:03.013 --> 43:04.947
Just accept what you were given.

43:05.515 --> 43:08.279
A new home, a job.

43:09.119 --> 43:12.384
A chance to make
what you did right.

43:13.190 --> 43:15.886
I have to be with my wife
and my daughter.

43:16.059 --> 43:17.549
They need me.

43:21.898 --> 43:23.627
Ben, look at me.

43:26.436 --> 43:28.370
Death is here.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.736
Close to you.

43:31.408 --> 43:34.468
It's what you hear in the forest
when you're all alone.

43:35.412 --> 43:37.642
Now, you cheated him once.

43:38.348 --> 43:40.748
You won't cheat him a second time.

43:41.351 --> 43:44.377
This bus won't take you home.

43:45.956 --> 43:49.858
Stay on it and you'll never see
your family again.

43:52.429 --> 43:54.954
Make the right choice
while you still can.

44:32.602 --> 44:34.069
Thank you.

44:50.287 --> 44:51.515
Ben?

44:51.688 --> 44:52.780
Hi.

44:52.956 --> 44:54.048
Hi.

44:54.224 --> 44:56.715
I didn't see you today.

44:56.893 --> 44:58.793
I was cleaning the chapel.

44:59.362 --> 45:01.489
It's beautiful inside.

45:02.165 --> 45:03.496
Quiet.

45:03.667 --> 45:06.397
Quiet guy who likes quiet places.

45:06.569 --> 45:07.627
Shocking.

45:08.905 --> 45:11.169
Hey, what are you doing for dinner?

45:13.777 --> 45:15.472
You still smoke?

45:16.880 --> 45:19.872
Cigarette burn
between your fingers, right?

45:20.050 --> 45:22.450
Yeah. I quit a few years back.

45:22.619 --> 45:24.849
I fell asleep while smoking.

45:25.021 --> 45:28.252
- Could've burned your house down.
- That's why I quit.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.851
So you been in Dundee long?

45:33.029 --> 45:35.725
No, not long.

45:35.899 --> 45:38.231
I'm actually from San Diego.

45:38.401 --> 45:40.494
And you're a psychiatrist.

45:41.671 --> 45:43.400
And your job brought you here.

45:43.573 --> 45:44.597
Partly.

45:44.774 --> 45:49.143
And then there was the train wreck
of a relationship that I was in.

45:49.312 --> 45:52.281
I think I needed to escape that.

45:53.450 --> 45:55.350
- Changing your whole life around.
- Yeah.

45:55.518 --> 45:57.452
That must have been tough.

45:57.954 --> 46:01.412
No. Not really.

46:03.626 --> 46:07.619
I figured I was probably more lonely
in the relationship than I was out.

46:08.798 --> 46:10.322
I was right.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.401
It looks like they're kicking us out.

46:19.843 --> 46:21.504
Need a ride?

46:22.212 --> 46:25.477
No, thanks. I'm just down the road.

46:26.116 --> 46:28.050
Okay. I'll see you in the morning.

47:07.924 --> 47:09.255
This bus is not for you, Ben.

47:53.069 --> 47:54.161
What did we do?

48:50.593 --> 48:52.754
What's the symbol mean?

48:56.666 --> 48:58.657
I killed a man.

48:59.936 --> 49:01.597
Shot him.

49:04.173 --> 49:06.903
And I did it for no other reason
than he was home.

49:08.678 --> 49:10.908
That's how I got here.

49:11.514 --> 49:13.379
What does it mean?

49:13.950 --> 49:17.249
The symbol on your wrist,
the one that you carved into the trail.

49:17.420 --> 49:19.581
How could I have done that?

49:19.756 --> 49:21.747
I saw you out, William.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.019
No one can get out.

49:27.730 --> 49:29.630
Not even you have that key.

49:31.901 --> 49:33.300
What does it mean?

49:33.469 --> 49:37.098
You should know.
You're just like me.

49:51.187 --> 49:53.246
They're watching again.

50:00.129 --> 50:01.653
Nobody's watching, Robbie.

50:02.699 --> 50:04.462
I see them.

50:05.068 --> 50:06.592
There's nobody.

50:06.769 --> 50:08.464
Do you understand that?

50:08.638 --> 50:10.367
That's why they keep you here,
Robbie.

50:10.540 --> 50:13.168
It's because you act crazy
and you talk crazy.

50:13.343 --> 50:15.208
There's nobody watching us.

50:17.347 --> 50:19.611
You're here too, Ben.

50:36.899 --> 50:38.526
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

50:38.701 --> 50:42.569
I'm picking up some furniture
in Silverton. I could use a hand.

50:48.778 --> 50:50.575
Oh, rain clouds.

50:50.747 --> 50:52.806
I suspect it's gonna start up again.

50:55.251 --> 50:57.219
People like Robbie...

50:57.920 --> 51:02.220
People with psychological issues,
do they even know it?

51:02.392 --> 51:04.155
No, not usually.

51:04.327 --> 51:07.785
The hardest part of treatment
is convincing them they're ill.

51:08.698 --> 51:10.689
What's wrong with Robbie?

51:11.634 --> 51:12.931
Robbie killed his father.

51:14.203 --> 51:18.537
Stabbed him 40 times with a hunting
knife, then burnt the house down.

51:18.708 --> 51:21.176
- Robbie did that?
- Yup.

51:22.045 --> 51:24.536
His father was a bad man.

51:25.948 --> 51:28.280
Robbie thinks people
are watching him.

51:28.451 --> 51:29.816
Yup.

51:29.986 --> 51:33.444
Well, we all create fictions
to deal with our pain.

51:33.890 --> 51:37.087
The only thing watching Robbie
is his guilt.

51:45.001 --> 51:47.993
I'll be right back.
I just want to say goodbye to Carl.

52:30.146 --> 52:33.309
It looks like poison ivy,
maybe an allergic reaction.

52:34.317 --> 52:36.911
How's everything else?
You look tired.

52:37.086 --> 52:39.213
I haven't been sleeping so well.

52:39.388 --> 52:40.412
Because?

52:41.724 --> 52:43.453
I've never lived in the woods before.

52:43.626 --> 52:45.821
At night, you get woken up.

52:45.995 --> 52:49.260
You hear things.
Well, sometimes I even see things.

52:49.432 --> 52:52.697
Nothing's out there.
You know, it's just the wind.

52:53.102 --> 52:54.831
Yeah, I know.

52:58.708 --> 53:03.702
I'll give you some
prescription-strength hydrocortisone.

53:03.880 --> 53:06.075
It'll bring the swelling down.

53:17.627 --> 53:19.060
Hey.

53:19.228 --> 53:20.593
Hi.

53:24.767 --> 53:28.601
I was gonna take a walk
down Plowers' trail after work.

53:30.206 --> 53:31.537
You wanna come along?

53:37.446 --> 53:39.346
Oh, come on, dog, stop digging.

54:00.403 --> 54:02.462
I hope you like the rain.

54:03.172 --> 54:04.696
It's on its way.

54:05.341 --> 54:07.366
Can my dog come along?

54:07.543 --> 54:09.443
What's his name?

54:09.979 --> 54:11.003
Dog.

54:12.481 --> 54:14.244
You named your dog Dog?

54:14.417 --> 54:16.351
Well, I just found him.

54:16.619 --> 54:18.382
Yes, bring Dog.

54:18.554 --> 54:21.045
But we're giving him a real name
on the walk.

54:21.791 --> 54:23.224
All right.

54:25.628 --> 54:28.461
What about Bill?

54:28.631 --> 54:30.121
Bill?

54:30.399 --> 54:32.526
What kind of name is Bill for a dog?

54:32.702 --> 54:34.932
It's better than Dog.

54:35.104 --> 54:37.004
Not by much.

54:38.174 --> 54:40.267
So tell me something about you.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.001
Like what?

54:42.545 --> 54:44.069
I don't know.

54:44.447 --> 54:46.381
What's your favorite color?

54:47.450 --> 54:49.281
Well, I haven't thought
about that one.

54:49.452 --> 54:53.047
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Over here.

54:53.222 --> 54:54.450
Come on, Dog.

55:03.633 --> 55:06.796
It's beautiful.

55:07.536 --> 55:09.128
I know.

55:12.241 --> 55:14.106
Do you come here a lot?

55:15.611 --> 55:17.511
Yeah, quite a bit.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.375
To think.

55:19.548 --> 55:21.072
About?

55:24.487 --> 55:26.751
Just things I'm trying to let go of.

55:28.591 --> 55:30.286
There's a struggle.

55:30.459 --> 55:32.518
How do you live
if you're ruled by your past?

55:32.695 --> 55:36.187
But how do you let go
of a past that made you?

55:41.771 --> 55:44.171
You still haven't told me anything
about yourself.

55:46.642 --> 55:49.270
I like the name Dog for a dog.

55:50.713 --> 55:52.840
Maybe it's not such a bad name.

56:00.423 --> 56:02.050
Hey, man.

56:02.224 --> 56:06.126
Kitchen guys wanted me to let you
know the disposal line's backed up.

57:43.459 --> 57:44.721
Sorry, Ben. Sorry.

57:44.894 --> 57:47.727
- We thought you were William.
- He found a way out.

57:48.230 --> 57:49.561
You need a hand finding him?

57:49.732 --> 57:51.859
No, no, he's dangerous.
We'll see you tomorrow.

57:52.034 --> 57:53.797
Come on.

59:08.677 --> 59:11.043
I wonder how far down it is.

59:16.185 --> 59:18.676
Everybody's looking for you.

59:18.854 --> 59:20.344
They're worried.

59:21.690 --> 59:23.715
They always worry.

59:24.226 --> 59:26.057
That's what they do.

59:30.332 --> 59:35.793
I kept thinking they'd let me go
once I got better if I...

59:36.805 --> 59:39.205
If I made better choices.

59:46.782 --> 59:48.977
I have a son in the world.

59:51.287 --> 59:53.346
I don't see him.

59:55.624 --> 59:57.216
Yeah, me too.

59:57.393 --> 59:59.520
I mean, I have a daughter.

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.262
We're far apart.

01:00:03.899 --> 01:00:06.197
My boy, he...

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:10.102
Well, he probably doesn't
even remember me by now.

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:19.545
They made me this way.

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.943
They gave me drugs.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:28.715
Put me in that building because
I wouldn't do what they wanted.

01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:32.690
I wouldn't be
who they wanted me to be.

01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:35.758
Let's go back.

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.934
If you run,
they're just gonna follow you.

01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:45.568
I know.

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:50.735
But they can't follow me to heaven.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:58.447
No. No.

01:01:06.862 --> 01:01:08.489
Give me a hand.

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.527
Are you okay?

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.710
Have you ever had this
happen before?

01:01:21.877 --> 01:01:23.139
No.

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.041
Never a suicide.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:29.441
He wanted to go home.

01:01:30.452 --> 01:01:32.886
Mount Angel was his home.

01:01:34.156 --> 01:01:37.353
I guess he just couldn't accept that.

01:01:39.561 --> 01:01:41.529
Sometimes
I think the only real medicine...

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:44.791
...is to accept our lives as they are.

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.571
Come on. I'll walk you home.

01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:19.491
Hi.

01:02:19.968 --> 01:02:21.299
Hi.

01:02:23.138 --> 01:02:25.538
I heard what happened with William.

01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:29.673
I just wanted to make sure
you're all right.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.639
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:02:37.886 --> 01:02:39.751
Do you need anything?

01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:44.181
Are you hungry?

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.556
I can make us something to eat.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.367
Okay.

01:02:54.002 --> 01:02:55.196
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:02:59.975 --> 01:03:01.943
This beer is good.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:06.775
I mean, I'm not a big beer girl,
but there's actually beer that's called:

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.974
"Stone Brew Nation"?

01:03:09.151 --> 01:03:10.209
What is that?

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.518
But it's good.

01:03:17.659 --> 01:03:19.650
Are you happy here?

01:03:22.364 --> 01:03:25.299
It's... It's a little strange.

01:03:25.467 --> 01:03:27.264
I don't know.

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:29.427
Do you find it odd?

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.802
Odd?

01:03:33.108 --> 01:03:34.735
No.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:40.439
Dundee is perfectly,
boringly small-town normal.

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:44.074
- I like the people, though.
- Yes, the people are very nice.

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.652
- Yeah.
- Decent.

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:49.154
Yeah, they just...
You know, they're hard working.

01:03:49.324 --> 01:03:50.848
Normal.

01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:24.725
I'm sorry, I...

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.856
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.624
I should leave.

01:04:58.093 --> 01:04:59.822
Good boy, Dog.

01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:06.895
Damn it.

01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:10.838
Sorry, Dog.

01:05:11.006 --> 01:05:13.065
I'll get it down for you later.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.645
Hey, Robbie.

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:28.544
Hey, Ben.

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:32.918
No clouds out tonight.

01:06:33.088 --> 01:06:34.612
No.

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:38.987
How many you up to?

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:44.658
Four thousand two hundred
and twenty-one.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.462
Listen, Robbie.

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:49.797
I gotta ask you something.

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:54.299
- Remember...?
- You want a Mountain Dew?

01:06:55.944 --> 01:06:57.536
Thank you.

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:00.639
You're welcome.

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:06.086
Robbie.

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.186
The people that you said
are watching...

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.787
...who are they?

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.530
I don't know.

01:07:20.535 --> 01:07:22.332
Do they watch me?

01:07:24.773 --> 01:07:26.297
Yes.

01:08:59.067 --> 01:09:01.228
There's nothing
that we can do to beat death.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.487
Dog, get in the house.

01:09:23.258 --> 01:09:25.920
Dog, come on. Inside.

01:09:34.202 --> 01:09:36.170
Leave me alone!

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.997
Leave me alone!

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:42.336
Leave me alone!

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.376
Leave me alone!

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.843
Leave me alone!

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.139
Leave me alone!

01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:03.658
I just wanna go home.

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:10.797
I miss you.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.462
I'm sorry.

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:16.928
I know.

01:11:18.306 --> 01:11:20.365
I just wanna come home.

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:22.034
Then do.

01:11:26.414 --> 01:11:28.644
Just come home, Ben.

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.571
Let's go, Dog. Come on.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.305
Dog.

01:12:31.479 --> 01:12:32.741
Dog?

01:12:40.755 --> 01:12:42.222
Dog!

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.586
Dog!

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.469
How's your head?

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.075
You took a nasty fall.

01:13:02.477 --> 01:13:04.308
What am I doing here?

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.181
You were running through the woods
out of control.

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.245
I couldn't let you leave.

01:13:13.521 --> 01:13:15.989
What do you mean,
you couldn't let me leave?

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:25.092
What's this?

01:13:25.266 --> 01:13:27.097
Patient folder.

01:13:27.869 --> 01:13:29.894
Your patient folder.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:35.938
You've been with us
since shortly after the accident.

01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:38.340
What accident?

01:13:40.648 --> 01:13:45.051
We all create fictions
to hide our pain.

01:13:56.364 --> 01:13:57.854
No.

01:14:01.636 --> 01:14:04.196
No, they're not dead. This is a lie.

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:09.771
Three years ago,
you fell asleep smoking.

01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:11.510
There was a fire.

01:14:11.679 --> 01:14:13.544
You got out.

01:14:14.115 --> 01:14:16.640
But Katie and Lisa didn't.

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:19.152
You blamed yourself.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.515
You couldn't handle the guilt.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.950
You disappeared
after several months.

01:14:25.126 --> 01:14:30.154
Then you were arrested burglarizing
an empty warehouse in Dallas.

01:14:30.598 --> 01:14:31.997
You were placed in care...

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:37.230
...and you came here shortly after
to continue treatment.

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.339
I'm not a patient.

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.438
I work here. I'm a groundskeeper.

01:14:43.611 --> 01:14:46.512
You and Robbie tend the grounds.
You both enjoy it.

01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:49.616
Right, and I have a cabin
on Plowers' trail.

01:14:49.784 --> 01:14:50.978
I have a dog.

01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:52.642
The old smith cabin?

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:56.222
It's been empty for three years.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.723
There's no dog, Ben.

01:15:00.061 --> 01:15:02.188
We don't allow animals
at the Mount.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:06.896
You're lying to me.

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:10.130
Why are you lying to me, Ezra?

01:15:11.439 --> 01:15:12.804
They're not dead.

01:15:12.974 --> 01:15:14.271
I'm gonna prove it to you.

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:30.516
Hi, I'm Lisa Madison,
and I've been selling homes...

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:33.456
...in the Marietta, Powder Springs
area for over a year now.

01:15:33.628 --> 01:15:35.152
I know the area and the people...

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.798
...because I live in Marietta
with my daughter.

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.456
They made my dream a reality.

01:15:39.634 --> 01:15:41.295
RealTops made it all possible
for me.

01:15:41.469 --> 01:15:43.562
- They can make it possible...
- Who's that, Ben?

01:15:43.738 --> 01:15:45.831
- Bye.
- I don't...

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.441
I don't know.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:00.886
Come on, it's late.

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:04.018
Let's walk you to your room.

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.251
We'll talk more in the morning.

01:16:16.504 --> 01:16:18.438
Ben! Don't!

01:16:31.619 --> 01:16:34.486
No, no. No.

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:37.056
Come on, let's go.

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:38.988
Let's go.

01:16:43.364 --> 01:16:44.854
Hey.

01:16:46.067 --> 01:16:47.625
Hey!

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:50.130
Let me out!

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:53.069
Ezra, let me out!

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:56.269
Ezra, let me out!

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:57.870
Let me out!

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.112
No, no.

01:17:07.288 --> 01:17:10.416
Ezra! No, no!

01:17:42.156 --> 01:17:43.987
Thank you.

01:17:45.893 --> 01:17:47.758
Ben, hi.

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.295
- Hi.
- You doing better?

01:17:51.799 --> 01:17:54.290
I was hoping
you weren't still mad at me.

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:57.465
About what?

01:17:58.506 --> 01:18:00.633
What happened at the cabin.

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:05.745
I'm sorry,
I don't remember any cabin.

01:18:13.621 --> 01:18:15.145
Ben?

01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:18.222
Are you okay?

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:37.640
I was talking to a man.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.641
An angel.

01:18:43.651 --> 01:18:48.520
And he warned me
that if I didn't accept my life here...

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.157
...then I would die.

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:54.786
That death would find me.

01:18:57.832 --> 01:18:59.356
And...

01:19:02.136 --> 01:19:06.095
A couple of times,
I would have sworn...

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:09.937
...that I saw a demon or something.

01:19:10.311 --> 01:19:12.711
And I would have tried
to leave sooner...

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:17.576
...but I was afraid.

01:19:21.055 --> 01:19:23.182
- Those were all hallucinations?
- Yeah.

01:19:24.692 --> 01:19:28.822
Yeah, the angel
is a subconscious representation...

01:19:28.996 --> 01:19:32.796
...of your desire to heal.

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:37.134
The angel was asking you
to accept this life...

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.239
...which meant getting better.

01:19:39.874 --> 01:19:43.708
But your mind struggled,
because to heal...

01:19:44.645 --> 01:19:49.605
...it would also mean
letting go of Lisa and Katie.

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.342
Yeah.

01:19:51.519 --> 01:19:56.320
So you manifested fears
and images of death...

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:58.425
...to keep you here.

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.695
I wanna start over.

01:20:12.173 --> 01:20:13.435
I wanna forget.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:18.001
You don't have to forget.

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:21.247
You just have to move on.

01:20:24.852 --> 01:20:28.015
I wanna be outside
working the grounds again.

01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:29.747
All right.

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:34.928
We'll move you back to your old room,
away from Building Number 5.

01:20:51.412 --> 01:20:53.539
Do you sleep with the light on?

01:20:56.584 --> 01:20:58.142
Light on?

01:20:58.319 --> 01:20:59.718
Yeah.

01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:04.347
I can't sleep in the dark.
I need that light on.

01:21:04.525 --> 01:21:09.224
If not, I'm afraid that when I wake,
everything will be gone...

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:12.127
...and it'll only be me left
in the world.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.091
Does that sound crazy?

01:21:15.269 --> 01:21:18.830
No. It doesn't sound crazy.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.631
Do you like it here, Ben?

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.139
I'm okay with it.

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.581
I like it here.

01:21:28.983 --> 01:21:31.383
It's better than my old life.

01:21:32.386 --> 01:21:34.217
That's great, Robbie.

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.648
Ben.

01:21:39.727 --> 01:21:42.457
No one's ever treated me
like you do.

01:21:43.998 --> 01:21:45.693
Like a friend.

01:21:47.368 --> 01:21:48.892
That's because you are my friend.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:52.599
My best friend.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.982
Are you sure you want something
with shepherd in it?

01:22:37.151 --> 01:22:39.278
- Positive.
- Well, we have one.

01:22:39.453 --> 01:22:42.684
Small thing, really. Well-mannered.

01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:54.824
How long has this dog been here?

01:22:56.003 --> 01:22:58.767
Not long. About a week.

01:23:58.933 --> 01:24:01.026
You're just like me.

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.232
What happened?

01:27:22.903 --> 01:27:25.235
- He's disappeared.
- Not for long.

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.206
He'll turn up.

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:32.405
Find Ben.

01:27:33.614 --> 01:27:35.104
It's him.

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:38.082
Okay, go in.

01:27:51.999 --> 01:27:55.799
Ben, I stopped by your room.
You weren't there.

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.631
I was worried.

01:27:59.473 --> 01:28:00.872
Ben?

01:28:05.746 --> 01:28:07.907
Ben's not here.

01:28:09.116 --> 01:28:10.743
He went home.

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:29.427
Ben. What are you doing here?

01:28:31.071 --> 01:28:32.902
Take it easy, Ben. Take it easy.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:35.108
Ben, take it easy.

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:51.858
Since when do angels bleed?

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:54.995
Ben, listen to me.

01:28:55.696 --> 01:28:58.893
Ben, listen to me. Calm down.

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:03.168
Ben. Relax.

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.703
Ben, calm down.

01:29:07.074 --> 01:29:09.042
So it never happened?

01:29:09.209 --> 01:29:11.609
- It never happened?
- No.

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:16.547
Then they're alive.

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.815
Ben, think of what you're doing.

01:29:24.825 --> 01:29:26.588
- No!
- Ben.

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:33.799
You lied to me.

01:29:35.135 --> 01:29:36.568
Why did you do this?

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.371
Rehabilitation, Ben.

01:29:42.776 --> 01:29:48.112
What if instead of killing people,
we could change them...

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:51.979
...by providing them with new lives,
environments?

01:29:52.152 --> 01:29:53.881
- Insane.
- No.

01:29:54.054 --> 01:29:55.885
It all starts in the mind.

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.320
What people do, why they do it...

01:29:59.126 --> 01:30:02.152
...the selfish choices, it's all in here.

01:30:02.329 --> 01:30:04.194
In our heads.

01:30:05.165 --> 01:30:09.431
What if we could fix
human beings, Ben?

01:30:09.603 --> 01:30:13.471
Fix them before they've even made
those mistakes.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.039
Then they wouldn't be human.

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:18.440
- No, no, you don't understand.
- Don't you move.

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:23.106
I understand.

01:30:23.283 --> 01:30:25.274
I understand.

01:30:25.452 --> 01:30:28.012
You tried to convince me
I was crazy, Ezra.

01:30:28.188 --> 01:30:30.679
You wanted me to believe
that if I left, I'd die.

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:32.621
That bus never crashed.

01:30:32.793 --> 01:30:35.421
You told me my family was dead.

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:39.532
You're not rehabilitating people, Ezra.
You're torturing them.

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:42.399
I saved your life, Ben.

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:44.799
Like you saved William's.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:50.037
A different case. He didn't do well.

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:51.700
You pumped him full of drugs.

01:30:51.879 --> 01:30:55.280
- You did the same thing to me.
- The drugs just loosened the anxiety.

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.507
You made him nuts.

01:30:56.683 --> 01:30:58.742
He was seeing things.
I was seeing things.

01:30:58.919 --> 01:31:02.047
- He made a choice.
- He had no choice.

01:31:02.222 --> 01:31:03.314
You killed him, Ezra.

01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:05.822
You may as well pushed him
off that cliff yourself.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:08.086
You'd be buried, Ben.

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:11.698
Dead. Mud and worms.

01:31:14.201 --> 01:31:17.261
We gave William
a second chance at life.

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:21.704
- The same chance we gave you.
- I didn't ask for one.

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:30.209
Can't let you leave, Ben.

01:31:35.622 --> 01:31:37.988
I'm not so sure you can stop me.

01:31:38.158 --> 01:31:40.820
I found your files, Ezra.
I made a copy.

01:31:40.994 --> 01:31:43.929
- Where's the hard drive?
- Hidden, somewhere safe.

01:31:46.633 --> 01:31:49.830
And it'll stay that way
as long as I make it home.

01:31:50.003 --> 01:31:53.029
Otherwise, it will go
to every paper in the country.

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.967
Now I'm gonna go home, Ezra.

01:31:57.144 --> 01:32:00.136
And the only way you can stop me
is if you kill me.

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:09.250
Kill you?

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:14.688
Ben, as far as the world
is concerned...

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:17.126
...you're already dead.

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:43.453
Ben.

01:32:44.391 --> 01:32:49.090
What we're doing,
we're doing for the right reasons.

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:21.426
Mommy, I had a dream
about Daddy.

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.898
He lived in the woods
with big trees and stuff.

01:33:25.065 --> 01:33:28.466
I went to see him, but he was sad.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:31.337
I told him about the bird.

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:33.473
What bird, honey?

01:33:35.375 --> 01:33:38.833
The jaybird.
The bird that didn't die.

01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:45.841
Maybe Daddy's like the jaybird.

01:33:46.019 --> 01:33:49.352
Maybe someday
he's gonna come back too.

01:33:50.123 --> 01:33:53.092
Don't think that way, honey.
Don't think that Daddy ever left.

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.057
Because he didn't.

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:57.889
He's still here with us.

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:00.328
I know he is.

01:34:50.917 --> 01:34:54.546
Mommy, what's the greatest thing
you ever saw?

01:34:56.056 --> 01:34:58.388
I don't think I've seen it yet, baby.
