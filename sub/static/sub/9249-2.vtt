00:01.296 --> 00:03.306
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:03.307 --> 00:05.246
Well, for eight intense weeks,

00:05.247 --> 00:07.281
I was surrounded
by brilliant novelists

00:07.282 --> 00:08.982
and poets and playwrights.

00:08.984 --> 00:10.984
Sounds wonderful.

00:10.986 --> 00:12.185
No, it was awful.

00:12.187 --> 00:14.088
They hated my writing.

00:14.089 --> 00:16.624
- Aw, honey, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.693
The more they hated it,
the more it drove me.

00:18.694 --> 00:20.694
I dug deep, I found my voice.

00:20.696 --> 00:22.562
I bet you have
a beautiful voice.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.665
No, turns out my voice has
the mouth of a sailor.

00:26.967 --> 00:28.568
Ooh, that's a spicy blurb.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.904
That's what the
publisher said...

00:29.905 --> 00:31.038
when he bought my book.

00:31.039 --> 00:32.205
Oh!

00:34.408 --> 00:35.309
What did you do?

00:35.310 --> 00:37.110
I bought us...

00:37.112 --> 00:39.012
(using announcer voice):
a brand new car!

00:39.014 --> 00:41.415
This Dodge Challenger
comes fully equipped

00:41.416 --> 00:42.683
with a heated steering wheel

00:42.684 --> 00:44.318
and illuminated cup holders.

00:44.319 --> 00:45.818
What?

00:49.723 --> 00:51.924
(hammering)

00:57.097 --> 00:59.265
What are you doing?

01:02.870 --> 01:04.872
What are you doing?!

01:04.873 --> 01:06.706
Writing.

01:08.142 --> 01:10.711
I mean, you know, obviously
not at this exact second.

01:10.712 --> 01:12.346
But I was trying to write,

01:12.347 --> 01:14.748
and the drip under the sink was
driving me crazy,

01:14.749 --> 01:16.183
so I had to get a wrench

01:16.184 --> 01:18.318
out of the junk drawer,
which is organized.

01:18.319 --> 01:19.519
You're welcome.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.856
Turns out that drip was
masking, like, a humming,

01:22.857 --> 01:25.192
like a high-pitched
brain-piercing hum,

01:25.193 --> 01:27.260
which actually is not coming
from the fuse box,

01:27.261 --> 01:28.328
which is now labeled.

01:28.329 --> 01:29.228
You're welcome.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.731
Turns out it was
behind this thing,

01:31.732 --> 01:34.301
which is now all cleaned
out and color-coded.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.468
You're welcome.

01:36.470 --> 01:38.537
Still doesn't get
us to the shoe.

01:38.539 --> 01:39.606
Oh.

01:39.607 --> 01:40.941
Well, I think
that's pretty obvious.

01:40.942 --> 01:43.009
The shoe is a, um...

01:43.010 --> 01:44.710
it's a cry for help.

01:44.712 --> 01:46.745
Oh, Mol.

01:46.747 --> 01:48.415
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

01:48.416 --> 01:49.983
I've got a publisher
breathing down my neck,

01:49.984 --> 01:52.085
and I haven't written
more than a couple of words

01:52.086 --> 01:53.185
since I got home.

01:53.187 --> 01:54.721
Sweetie, you got to write.

01:54.722 --> 01:56.890
You're our meal ticket.

01:56.891 --> 01:58.357
What can we do to help?

01:58.359 --> 02:00.360
Nothing, unless you have
enough dirty sex stories

02:00.361 --> 02:02.027
to fill half a book.

02:03.863 --> 02:05.765
Okay, you'd better make
a fresh pot of coffee. Oh, God.

02:05.766 --> 02:07.232
We're gonna be here a while.

02:40.516 --> 02:41.849
Don't answer it!
Don't answer it!

02:41.850 --> 02:42.784
Don't answer it! No!

02:42.785 --> 02:44.485
Whoa!

02:44.486 --> 02:46.821
God, why not?

02:46.822 --> 02:47.722
'Cause it's my publisher.

02:47.723 --> 02:48.756
And he wants the book.

02:48.757 --> 02:49.824
Do you have a book to give him?

02:49.825 --> 02:51.925
'Cause I sure as hell don't.

02:53.361 --> 02:54.695
(sighs) Thank God.

02:54.696 --> 02:55.730
Yeah, she's here.

02:55.731 --> 02:57.365
Don't. No, no.

02:57.366 --> 02:58.800
No.

02:58.801 --> 03:00.301
Wait, scratch that.

03:00.302 --> 03:01.302
I am mistaken.

03:01.303 --> 03:03.171
Ms. Flynn is not here.

03:03.172 --> 03:05.505
That was my reflection
in the mirror.

03:06.974 --> 03:09.542
She has stepped out and
won't be back for...

03:09.544 --> 03:11.178
Two... Three-three.
No, two.

03:11.179 --> 03:13.714

to put you on hold for a second.

03:25.093 --> 03:26.260
All right.

03:26.261 --> 03:27.360
You, too.

03:27.362 --> 03:29.229
Thank you.
My pleasure.

03:29.231 --> 03:31.197
I've dodged many a
phone call in my day.

03:31.199 --> 03:33.601
AT&T and Rent-A-Center
both think I drowned

03:33.602 --> 03:36.436
on a white-water rafting trip.

03:37.938 --> 03:40.374
A week. What am I supposed
to do with a week?

03:40.375 --> 03:42.242
I don't know, write a book.

03:42.243 --> 03:44.078
Really?

03:44.079 --> 03:46.046
What? I just don't
understand the process.

03:46.047 --> 03:48.015
The process is...
if I don't finish this book,

03:48.016 --> 03:49.383
they're gonna want
the advance back.

03:49.384 --> 03:51.518
Which, if you remember,
we blew on a muscle car.

03:51.519 --> 03:52.720
You blew.

03:52.721 --> 03:53.821
Really?

03:53.822 --> 03:56.090
You want to finger-point
right now?

03:56.091 --> 03:58.125
Okay, all right, I'm sorry.

03:58.126 --> 03:59.693
Listen.

03:59.694 --> 04:02.296
I think I know what you need.

04:02.297 --> 04:03.596
Flynn!

04:03.598 --> 04:05.065
Get your butt in that seat

04:05.066 --> 04:06.900
and your fingers
on that keyboard!

04:06.901 --> 04:09.469
I am sick of hearing
your whiney-ass excuses!

04:09.470 --> 04:12.905
I want results, not
reasons, so shut your mouth

04:12.907 --> 04:15.609
and don't get up until
you have typed "The End"!

04:15.610 --> 04:18.077
Do I make myself clear?!

04:19.279 --> 04:21.880
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

04:21.882 --> 04:24.985
No. No. I should have been
the understanding husband.

04:24.986 --> 04:26.787
I'm sorry. It's okay.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.156
You yelled at me!

04:29.157 --> 04:31.158
And-and now we know
that doesn't work.

04:31.159 --> 04:33.426
(crying)

04:37.464 --> 04:39.699
I wish I could help Molly
with her writing,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.368
but it's beyond my skill set.

04:41.369 --> 04:43.336
I'm more of a
"take out the trash

04:43.337 --> 04:45.305
and kill the spiders"
type of husband.

04:45.306 --> 04:46.673
You're scared of spiders.

04:46.674 --> 04:49.009
I said "type."

04:49.010 --> 04:51.478
All right, when was the
last time Molly wrote something?

04:51.479 --> 04:52.945
At her writers' workshop.

04:52.947 --> 04:55.815
She came up with all that
kinky stuff in only two months?

04:55.816 --> 04:58.785
My, the circus orgy alone
was very intricate.

04:58.786 --> 05:00.185
Yeah.

05:00.187 --> 05:02.322
The sword-swallower,
the contortionist, you know?

05:02.323 --> 05:04.624
All those clowns
coming out of that Murphy bed.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.359
There was a lot of moving parts.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.428
Wait. You read her book?

05:08.429 --> 05:09.829
Page by page.

05:09.830 --> 05:11.597
Every night,

05:11.599 --> 05:13.800
Victoria picks a section,
and we try to come

05:13.801 --> 05:17.370
as close as we can to doing
what the characters are doing.

05:17.371 --> 05:21.307
Have you no decency?

05:21.308 --> 05:22.674
No, I do not.

05:22.676 --> 05:24.177
Oh.
Uh, I also have

05:24.178 --> 05:25.445
no shame, no inhibitions,

05:25.446 --> 05:27.947
and from the belly button down,
no body hair.

05:27.948 --> 05:30.283
So that looks like...

05:30.284 --> 05:32.451
Ah, never mind.

05:34.787 --> 05:36.322
Let me ask you something.

05:36.323 --> 05:37.490
Since she's returned,

05:37.491 --> 05:39.592
have you and Molly been having
regular relations?

05:39.593 --> 05:42.461
In what world do you think
I'm gonna answer that?

05:42.462 --> 05:44.464
Well, since she's been back,

05:44.465 --> 05:46.666
he's been ordering
cottage cheese, so

05:46.667 --> 05:48.634
someone's seeing him naked.

05:48.635 --> 05:50.468
Yeah, seems to me

05:50.470 --> 05:52.538
she was writing a lot
when she wasn't getting any.

05:52.539 --> 05:54.440
Now that she's back,
you got her off track,

05:54.441 --> 05:55.841
'cause now she's getting plenty.

05:55.842 --> 05:57.810
Really, Dr. Seuss?

05:57.811 --> 06:00.212
Is that your diagnosis?
Well,

06:00.213 --> 06:01.313
think about it.

06:01.314 --> 06:02.948
Why do boxers abstain
before a big fight?

06:02.949 --> 06:04.884
Because it's hard
to pleasure themselves

06:04.885 --> 06:06.985
with those big gloves?

06:08.220 --> 06:10.790
It's 'cause sex saps
their strength, all right?

06:10.791 --> 06:13.893
A little self-denial keeps 'em
focused, sharp, on their game.

06:13.894 --> 06:15.761
Molly's not a boxer.
She's a writer.

06:15.762 --> 06:17.363
Who hasn't written a word
ever since she got home

06:17.364 --> 06:18.697
and started workin'
your heavy bag.

06:18.698 --> 06:23.569
Please. You're just talking
out of your shaved ass.

06:23.570 --> 06:25.271
Well, he may have a point.

06:25.272 --> 06:27.939
In Africa, I had an uncle
who was an artist.

06:27.941 --> 06:29.375
When starting a new painting,

06:29.376 --> 06:31.377
he'd go off into the
mountains by himself,

06:31.378 --> 06:33.178
leaving his many wives at home.

06:33.179 --> 06:35.948
When he returned, he'd
have a beautiful canvas.

06:35.949 --> 06:37.616
See? 'Cause he didn't have sex.

06:37.617 --> 06:39.985
Well, we were never really sure.

06:39.986 --> 06:43.054
A lot of the paintings
were of frightened sheep.

06:47.626 --> 06:49.827
(whistling)

06:56.034 --> 06:57.836
(sighs)

06:57.837 --> 06:59.303
Ooh.

06:59.305 --> 07:01.974
(indistinct voices
and cheering on TV)

07:01.975 --> 07:04.076
MOLLY: No!

07:04.077 --> 07:07.079
No! No! No!

07:07.080 --> 07:08.880
God!

07:08.881 --> 07:10.816
I'm trying to write in there.

07:10.817 --> 07:12.184
Are you kidding?

07:12.185 --> 07:14.853
Last time I was in the kitchen,
you were bleaching the grout.

07:14.854 --> 07:16.555
Well, that's my process, okay?

07:16.556 --> 07:18.155
So no TV!

07:19.224 --> 07:20.859
Just because
you can't buckle down

07:20.860 --> 07:23.828
and write your dirty book, we
all got to live like Mennonites?

07:23.829 --> 07:25.463
Yes.

07:25.464 --> 07:26.897
So, what am I supposed to do?

07:26.899 --> 07:29.267
I don't care!
Go outside and play.

07:29.268 --> 07:31.202
There's nobody to play with.

07:31.203 --> 07:33.505
Can't you just go play
by yourself?

07:33.506 --> 07:35.073
I played with myself yesterday.

07:35.074 --> 07:36.840
I can't do it again. I'm 60.

07:38.043 --> 07:40.979
Maybe I'll go ask if the old guy
across the street wants

07:40.980 --> 07:43.280
to go throw rocks off a bridge.
(groans)

07:43.282 --> 07:44.949
What did I tell
you about leaving

07:44.950 --> 07:46.284
your hemorrhoid
pillow laying around?

07:46.285 --> 07:47.752
I'm in a flare-up.

07:47.753 --> 07:49.754
It's like I'm trying
to pass a Chinese throwing star.

07:49.755 --> 07:51.188
Ew!

07:53.491 --> 07:57.127
Wow! I bet
we couldn't do that again.

07:58.463 --> 08:01.431
Okay. Okay, we're gonna

08:01.433 --> 08:03.568
give this one a 12
for difficulty.

08:03.569 --> 08:06.370
If we get this one,
we're champions of the world.

08:06.372 --> 08:09.040
Shh. When you talk, the plunger moves.
Sorry.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.042
Sorry, I'm nervous.

08:11.043 --> 08:13.978
(sighs)

08:13.979 --> 08:16.180
(whoops) U.S.A.!

08:16.181 --> 08:21.586
BOTH:
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

08:21.587 --> 08:24.155
(Vince whoops)
What the hell's going on here?

08:24.156 --> 08:27.257
She turned off the TV.

08:31.162 --> 08:34.198
Hey, look at you.

08:34.198 --> 08:35.832
Hold on.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.467
Just finishing up.
(printer whirring)

08:37.469 --> 08:39.035
How many pages you get done?

08:39.037 --> 08:41.972
Just the one.

08:41.974 --> 08:43.808
This is a letter
to your publisher.

08:43.808 --> 08:47.378
It's a proposal to turn
my novel into a novella.

08:47.379 --> 08:49.246
(laughs) What's a novella?

08:49.247 --> 08:50.448
Oh, it's a novel.

08:50.449 --> 08:52.116
Just, you know, one with, uh...

08:52.117 --> 08:53.384
(mumbles)

08:53.385 --> 08:54.752
...64 pages.

08:54.753 --> 08:57.354
You know, that way, I
can just slap a "The End"

08:57.355 --> 08:59.256
on this sucker and
be done with it.

08:59.257 --> 09:02.025
So it would just end
in the middle of the story?

09:02.027 --> 09:03.861
Well, do you have a better idea?

09:03.862 --> 09:05.596
Because I don't.
You know why?

09:05.597 --> 09:07.397
'Cause I don't have
ideas anymore.

09:07.399 --> 09:10.234
I haven't written a single
word since I got back.

09:10.235 --> 09:13.069
I'm... That's it!
I'm done! I'm tapped!

09:15.137 --> 09:17.808
No, you're not.

09:17.809 --> 09:19.743
You have me.

09:19.744 --> 09:22.646
And together, we will do,

09:22.647 --> 09:25.182
or not do,

09:25.183 --> 09:27.651
whatever it takes
to get you writing again.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.453
Really?

09:29.454 --> 09:31.188
You can count on it.

09:31.189 --> 09:33.222
I'm in your corner, champ.

09:34.057 --> 09:35.626
I'm not gonna shake your hand.

09:35.627 --> 09:37.594
I love you.
I love you, too.

09:37.595 --> 09:39.129
(laughs)

09:39.130 --> 09:41.965
S-Sweetie, what-what are you
doing down there?

09:41.966 --> 09:44.401
Aren't-aren't you supposed
to be working on your book?

09:44.402 --> 09:45.602
Oh, I am.

09:45.603 --> 09:47.903
I'm just tweaking the ending.

09:47.905 --> 09:50.374
(whoops loudly) Molly!
(laughs)

09:50.375 --> 09:51.708
Come on!
No!

09:51.709 --> 09:54.311
I need a little something
to clear my head. No, no!

09:54.312 --> 09:56.480
You need to keep working,
because Oh.

09:56.481 --> 09:57.948
I'm-I'm... I'm not in the mood.

09:57.949 --> 09:59.916
What? You are
always in the mood.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.518
You tried to get my bra off

10:01.519 --> 10:04.321
while we were
watching <i> Hotel Rwanda.</i>

10:04.322 --> 10:06.990
You'd already seen it.

10:06.991 --> 10:08.892
Mike.
No.

10:08.893 --> 10:10.260
You know you want to.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.628
No, not tonight.
(laughing)

10:11.629 --> 10:13.230
I am... I am so gassy.

10:13.231 --> 10:14.931
I'm gassy.

10:14.932 --> 10:17.567
(singsongy): If you're trying
to repulse me, it's not working.

10:17.568 --> 10:19.436
(laughing): Molly, no. No.

10:19.437 --> 10:21.705
Oh, maybe. No!<i> No!</i>

10:21.706 --> 10:22.905
Now, no means no!

10:22.906 --> 10:26.341
Now, you call me
when you want to cuddle.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:38.463 --> 10:41.633
Well, I did it.
I didn't do it.

10:41.634 --> 10:43.834
What?

10:43.836 --> 10:47.071
At 8:55 P.M. last night,
for the first time in his life,

10:47.072 --> 10:49.840
Mike Biggs turned down sex.

10:49.842 --> 10:52.143
Well, I know it was hard.

10:52.144 --> 10:53.944
Literally.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.416
But mark my words,
this is gonna work.

10:58.417 --> 10:59.751
That's what I'm afraid of.

10:59.752 --> 11:02.186
Molly's able to write again,
and instead of having sex,

11:02.187 --> 11:05.088
I'm stuck playing
hemorrhoid ring toss with Vince.

11:05.090 --> 11:08.159
You know, you could just
take a cold shower. Okay.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.528
Plus, there are a lot of
other things besides sex

11:10.529 --> 11:12.096
that can keep a couple together.

11:12.097 --> 11:13.431
Just look at us, huh?

11:13.432 --> 11:14.565
We're not intimate,

11:14.566 --> 11:16.466
yet we still care deeply
about each other.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.937
You know? Concerned about
the other's wants and needs.

11:19.938 --> 11:22.439
Finish each other's...

11:26.244 --> 11:28.345
I'm not saying that.
Come on!

11:28.347 --> 11:30.381
Don't be a...
Jackass! See?

11:30.382 --> 11:32.582
Till death do us part.

11:34.418 --> 11:36.286
(doorbell ringing)

11:39.390 --> 11:42.293
What do you want?

11:42.294 --> 11:44.261
I need somewhere
to write, Peggy.

11:44.262 --> 11:47.097
No distractions, no one
to talk to, no Internet.

11:47.098 --> 11:50.568
Just a place where
fun comes to die.

11:50.569 --> 11:52.536
Welcome.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.037
Thank you.

11:54.039 --> 11:56.006
Ooh. It even smells
like solitary confinement.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.508
No need to butter me up.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.375
I said you could stay.

11:59.377 --> 12:01.845
Can I just set up over in here?
Doesn't matter

12:01.846 --> 12:03.780
to me. You're in the way
wherever you are.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.316
You want to bounce anything

12:05.317 --> 12:07.051
off me, just let me know.

12:07.052 --> 12:08.318
Uh, I-I'm good.

12:08.319 --> 12:09.987
No bouncing, just writing.

12:09.988 --> 12:11.321
Understood.

12:11.323 --> 12:13.290
I'm probably
your target audience.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.858
Who cares what I think?

12:14.859 --> 12:17.528
This book isn't exactly
for the churchgoing crowd.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.695
Are you kidding?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.631
Have you ever read the Bible?

12:20.632 --> 12:23.634
Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot
sleeping with his daughters.

12:23.635 --> 12:27.203
That book is chock-full
of spilled seed.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.438
Wow. No wonder
you're always going to church.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.642
For that, and to see who died.

12:31.643 --> 12:34.211
In a way, the holy scriptures
were my gateway

12:34.212 --> 12:35.845
to my shelves of sin.

12:35.847 --> 12:38.915
What-what are you talking
about, your "shelves of sin"?

12:38.916 --> 12:41.351
(Molly laughs)

12:41.352 --> 12:44.921
Oh, my God!

12:44.922 --> 12:46.757
This whole wall is X-rated.

12:46.758 --> 12:48.325
I-I've never noticed it.

12:48.326 --> 12:51.762
I mean, I just assumed
these were all Westerns.

12:51.763 --> 12:54.563
Oh, some of 'em
got horses in 'em.

12:56.233 --> 13:00.904
Personally, I prefer...
a raunchy bodice-ripper.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.304
A good romp in the barouche.

13:02.306 --> 13:04.741
I don't even know
what that means.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.409
Classic erotica.

13:06.410 --> 13:10.647
Your <i>Lady Chatterley's,
Story of O, Candy.</i>

13:10.648 --> 13:12.315
"Banned in Paris."

13:12.316 --> 13:14.351
That's all I needed to hear.

13:14.352 --> 13:17.386
Those Frenchies are les pigs.

13:17.388 --> 13:19.823
Peggy, I had no idea.
Oh, yeah.

13:19.824 --> 13:21.658
I've been alone for a long time.

13:21.659 --> 13:25.060
If I didn't have some release,
I'd be a pretty angry woman.

13:28.465 --> 13:31.800
So, these were just out
the whole time Mike was a kid?

13:31.802 --> 13:33.770
I knew he wouldn't get into 'em.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.305
Books were as safe
as celery in this house.

13:51.587 --> 13:53.689
(whistles)

13:53.690 --> 13:56.024
She got more than 50% off.

13:57.827 --> 14:00.229
I shouldn't be doing this.

14:00.230 --> 14:03.331
It's like watching <i>Ace of
Cakes</i> when I'm on a diet.

14:08.638 --> 14:11.807
That's not right.

14:11.808 --> 14:14.243
Still works.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.012
Hey!

14:16.013 --> 14:17.847
Hey! Where you been all day?

14:17.848 --> 14:19.382
At your mother's,
trying to write.

14:19.383 --> 14:21.616
I thought that was where
fun went to die. (laughs)

14:21.618 --> 14:23.786
Well, now, it's where
I go to write,

14:23.787 --> 14:25.955
because I wrote 15
of the best pages

14:25.956 --> 14:27.389
I have ever written.

14:27.390 --> 14:28.890
Isn't it great?

14:28.892 --> 14:31.994
Yeah!

14:31.995 --> 14:34.697
Because that means you're gonna
be done soon, right?

14:34.698 --> 14:35.998
Oh, no, no, no.

14:35.999 --> 14:38.634
These new pages have opened up,
like, a whole new subplot.

14:38.635 --> 14:40.401
I think I'm on to a trilogy.

14:42.872 --> 14:45.541
I can't hold out for a trilogy.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.542
What are you talking about?
Oh, nothing.

14:47.544 --> 14:49.044
I mean, just don't get ahead
of yourself, you know?

14:49.045 --> 14:51.113
Finish the first one,
then take a little break.

14:51.114 --> 14:52.414
Maybe, like, a year or two.

14:52.415 --> 14:55.718
You know, just whatever it takes
to recharge the engine.

14:55.719 --> 14:58.686
I don't know. I'm just so happy
to be writing again.

14:58.688 --> 15:02.624
What do you say
we celebrate all my hard work

15:02.625 --> 15:05.661
by going upstairs
and making up for last night?

15:05.662 --> 15:07.729
Right now?
Mm-hmm.

15:07.730 --> 15:09.498
Molly, a guy likes
a little foreplay.

15:09.499 --> 15:10.766
Okay.

15:10.767 --> 15:11.900
I'll go up ahead of you.

15:11.901 --> 15:13.267
You can do that grabby thing.

15:13.269 --> 15:15.037
Come on. You do
that grabby thing.

15:15.038 --> 15:16.871
I love that.
No.

15:16.873 --> 15:19.474
Look, I can't just turn
it on like that, okay?

15:19.475 --> 15:21.877
Yeah, you can.

15:21.878 --> 15:25.913
Come on. I'm starting
to take this personally.

15:27.315 --> 15:30.986
Oh, God. Are you not attracted
to me anymore?

15:30.987 --> 15:32.788
Oh, no. Of course I am.

15:32.789 --> 15:34.389
You're beautiful, you're sexy,

15:34.390 --> 15:36.992
you got the cutest
little dimples, but

15:36.993 --> 15:39.694
I can't.

15:39.695 --> 15:41.263
You know what?

15:41.264 --> 15:43.165
I got enough things
destroying my confidence.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.232
I don't need you
to be one of 'em.

15:45.234 --> 15:47.269
Molly, wait. I'm doing this
to help you.

15:47.270 --> 15:49.937
How is this helping me?

15:49.939 --> 15:51.606
Okay, well...

15:51.607 --> 15:53.807
How can I put this?

15:54.643 --> 15:57.879
You're like a boxer.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.315
Because I want
to punch you in the face?

16:02.350 --> 16:05.220
No. Because writing
is like fighting.

16:05.221 --> 16:06.921
You got to stay focused.

16:06.922 --> 16:11.091
And when we have sex, well,
it... it saps your strength.

16:11.093 --> 16:13.361
What?!

16:13.362 --> 16:15.796
Why do you think

16:15.798 --> 16:17.799
you got so much writing done
in Iowa?

16:17.800 --> 16:19.467
Because I wasn't there
to tempt you.

16:19.468 --> 16:22.903
So, you put all your pent-up
desires onto the page.

16:22.905 --> 16:27.341
Where did you get
such a dopey idea?

16:27.343 --> 16:29.343
Carl.

16:29.345 --> 16:32.146
Carl. Yeah. Really?!
Well, look,

16:32.147 --> 16:34.415
I don't like that he's right,
either, but now we have proof.

16:34.416 --> 16:37.518
15 pages of people doing
all sorts of nasty things

16:37.519 --> 16:39.921
that we didn't get
to do last night.

16:39.922 --> 16:43.191
You're listening to Carl.

16:43.192 --> 16:45.960
I just... I need you
to hear that.

16:45.961 --> 16:49.497
Let... let that sink in!

16:49.498 --> 16:51.365
Well, the man's been
wrong his entire life.

16:51.366 --> 16:54.101
You got to figure he's due.
No!

16:54.102 --> 16:55.603
No, you don't. No, you don't,

16:55.604 --> 16:57.305
and especially not
when it's about us.

16:57.306 --> 17:00.841
Okay? Our love is strong
and healthy,

17:00.842 --> 17:03.644
and it has nothing
to do with my work.

17:03.645 --> 17:06.414
What we have is special,

17:06.415 --> 17:12.219
and we're not gonna let some
stupid superstition ruin that.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.721
You're right.
Carl's an idiot.

17:13.722 --> 17:15.356
Get upstairs.
(giggling)

17:15.357 --> 17:17.690
I'm getting close.

17:31.405 --> 17:34.207
Son of a bitch!

17:38.345 --> 17:40.147
(cheering, whistle blows on TV,
door closes)

17:40.148 --> 17:41.782
MAN (on TV): Incomplete.

17:41.783 --> 17:43.617
(indistinct shouting on TV)

17:43.618 --> 17:45.486
Aw, no!

17:45.487 --> 17:46.886
God,

17:46.888 --> 17:49.056
I knew I should have
held back last night.

17:49.057 --> 17:51.758
That second one was just greedy.

17:51.759 --> 17:54.227
Well, we don't know that
what we did last night

17:54.229 --> 17:56.396
is responsible
for what I didn't do today.

17:56.397 --> 17:57.864
Oh, don't be naive.

17:57.865 --> 18:00.167
Face the facts! We run too hot,
and that's no good!

18:00.168 --> 18:02.803
Well, what are we gonna do?
What can we do?

18:02.804 --> 18:04.004
You got to finish this book!

18:04.005 --> 18:05.872
Well, I'm not picking
the book over us.

18:05.873 --> 18:07.207
Yes, you are.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.343
'Cause you have a husband
that believes in you,

18:09.344 --> 18:11.144
and more importantly,
wants the money.

18:11.145 --> 18:14.047
Ah! So do I.
Is that bad?

18:14.048 --> 18:16.348
No. I've been without sex,
and I've been without money.

18:16.350 --> 18:19.119
Right now, I choose money.
Oh.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.587
That's why we're
so good together!

18:20.588 --> 18:21.921
Okay, okay, okay.

18:21.923 --> 18:23.957
From now on,
until you finish that book,

18:23.958 --> 18:26.293
this house is officially
a sex-free zone.

18:26.294 --> 18:28.627
Okay. What about the rewrite?

18:28.629 --> 18:32.499
We will cross that cold and
lonely bridge when we get to it.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.367
I love you!

18:34.368 --> 18:35.669
I love you, too.

18:35.670 --> 18:37.836
(grunts)

18:47.327 --> 18:49.396
Hey, how's it going today?

18:49.397 --> 18:50.662
It's amazing.

18:50.664 --> 18:53.733
Since we stopped having sex,
this thing writes itself.

18:53.734 --> 18:56.202
That's great, honey.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.571
Hey, can I read you something?

18:58.572 --> 19:00.572
I'm not sure if it works or not.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.809
Sure.
Okay.

19:02.810 --> 19:04.244
(sighs)

19:04.245 --> 19:06.779
"Slowly, she stepped
from the bath,

19:06.780 --> 19:10.583
"knowing his eye was pressed
greedily at the keyhole.

19:10.584 --> 19:14.387
"She placed one leg on the tub,
flesh glistening.

19:14.388 --> 19:16.456
"A bead of water wove its way

19:16.457 --> 19:19.784
