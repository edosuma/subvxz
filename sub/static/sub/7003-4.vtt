WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.069
Blue 32. Hi-hi-hike!
Brad, go long.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.671
All right.

00:06.672 --> 00:09.908
Deeper! Deeper!
Deep this, mini montana.

00:09.909 --> 00:12.911
We were just about
to take that outside.
Nice try.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.980
Is mom home?

00:14.981 --> 00:16.447
No.

00:16.448 --> 00:19.217
Great! Go long by the couch.
Give me a down.

00:22.321 --> 00:23.788
All right!

00:23.789 --> 00:26.190
Hey, didn't you sign up
for an elective today?

00:26.191 --> 00:27.692
Yeah. Let's go, randy.

00:27.693 --> 00:29.894
No, wait a minute.
I'm real proud of you.

00:29.895 --> 00:33.732
Your first year of shop -
the year of the ashtray.

00:35.467 --> 00:38.169
Actually, brad's taking home ec.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.403
What?

00:39.404 --> 00:43.842
This is the year of the muffin.
No way!

00:43.843 --> 00:45.276
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:45.277 --> 00:47.912
Home ec?
You really gotta take shop.

00:47.913 --> 00:51.783
It's where you learn about
tools, building things,
tearing stuff down, and...

00:51.784 --> 00:53.518
<i>(grunts)</i>

00:53.519 --> 00:55.920
Yeah, but home ec
is me and 30 girls.

00:55.921 --> 00:59.057
What do you wanna be
around 30 girls for?

00:59.058 --> 01:02.260
Oh-ho-ho!
I catch you.

01:02.261 --> 01:04.562
Before you go jumping
in a room with 30 girls,

01:04.563 --> 01:06.765
You really should take shop.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.900
Why?

01:08.901 --> 01:11.602
Shop prepares you for women.

01:11.603 --> 01:15.306
You learn how to cut wood.
How to sever a finger.

01:15.307 --> 01:17.208
You learn pain.

01:17.209 --> 01:19.443
<i>Then</i> you're ready for women.

02:30.249 --> 02:32.183
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

02:53.873 --> 02:55.940
Hey, tool man!
Oh!

02:55.941 --> 02:59.043
I watch you on tv
all the time.
I love you.

02:59.044 --> 03:00.812
I love you too.
Who are you?

03:00.813 --> 03:02.113
Joe morton,
your new neighbor.

03:02.114 --> 03:03.347
I just moved into the house
across the alley.

03:03.348 --> 03:06.550
Hey, all right.
I saw the moving van.
Uh-huh.

03:06.551 --> 03:08.319
Did I see a 50-inch-square tv?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.921
Know what's great
on the big screen?

03:09.922 --> 03:12.123
What?
<i>Tool time!</i>

03:12.124 --> 03:14.793
Welcome to the neighborhood.
What line of work you in?

03:14.794 --> 03:17.695
I'm in meat.
You're the tool man,
I'm the meat man.

03:17.696 --> 03:19.931
Morton meats.
You heard of us?
Yeah!

03:19.932 --> 03:22.400
Yeah. Eight locations.
Best meat in the midwest.

03:22.401 --> 03:24.669
You want a pen?

03:24.670 --> 03:28.072
There's a cow on there.
Yeah.

03:28.073 --> 03:30.441
Turn it upside down,
see what she does.

03:30.442 --> 03:32.443
<i>(mooing)</i>

03:34.180 --> 03:36.747
Kind of like "moo" power.

03:36.748 --> 03:40.351
That's great.
This hot rod's a beaut.
What year?

03:40.352 --> 03:42.553
This is '33.
Really?

03:42.554 --> 03:46.624
Look more like a '34 body
on a '33 chassis to me.
No, it's all '33.

03:46.625 --> 03:49.227
I'm no expert, but I go to
the hot rod show every year.

03:49.228 --> 03:52.663
Well, meat man, I built
it myself. It's a '33.

03:52.664 --> 03:55.599
So, I guess a big-time cable tv
host like you makes out pretty
good, huh?

03:55.600 --> 03:59.304
I guess you could say
I got the highest credit
limit allowed at sears.

03:59.305 --> 04:04.209
Still, you can't be making
bob vila money, right?
He's on real tv.

04:04.210 --> 04:07.912
It's common knowledge
that vila's overpaid
for what he does.

04:07.913 --> 04:10.715
Oh, I hit a nerve, huh?
Don't sit on that.

04:10.716 --> 04:13.718
Yeah, sure.
Whatever you're making,
you must be doing ok.

04:13.719 --> 04:15.954
Yeah.
Bought you one of these babies.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.057
I'm ok. I'm ok.
Don't worry about me.
I wasn't.

04:19.058 --> 04:23.561
What kind of grill is that?
Well, it's, um...

04:23.562 --> 04:26.965
Oh! It's a dented reproduction
of a '33 roadster.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.901
Just tell me how much it cost.
I'll give you the cash now.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.503
It was an accident.
I can pound that out.

04:32.504 --> 04:35.773
I just figured I'd drive it
before I put a dent in it.

04:35.774 --> 04:37.775
That's funny!

04:37.776 --> 04:39.844
I like that, you can
just shake things off.

04:39.845 --> 04:42.113
I'm gonna get back
on this windshield.

04:42.114 --> 04:44.182
Don't mind me.
I'm a fly on the wall.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.618
Wish I had some
insect repellent.

04:47.619 --> 04:51.122
I'll just buzz
around and watch.
All right.

04:55.827 --> 04:59.330
<i>(horn blares)</i>

04:59.331 --> 05:01.565
I really got
something to do inside.

05:01.566 --> 05:03.634
What is it?
A little problem.

05:03.635 --> 05:05.836
What's wrong?
What's wrong? Uh...

05:05.837 --> 05:07.972
It's my wife.

05:07.973 --> 05:09.673
She's got this condition.

05:09.674 --> 05:12.010
I gotta go wake her up,
dress her,

05:12.011 --> 05:14.478
Pour coffee down her throat
to get her going.

05:14.479 --> 05:16.881
I hear you, buddy.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.582
No, that's not it...

05:18.583 --> 05:20.851
Timmy, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

05:20.852 --> 05:23.888
I see you on tv, I figure
there's a guy who got it made.

05:23.889 --> 05:26.624
Now I find out there's a dark
side to the tool man.

05:26.625 --> 05:30.395
Hm. Take care, buddy.
Here's your paper.

05:31.863 --> 05:33.864
Beauty!

05:38.937 --> 05:40.939
Does everybody know
what time it is?

05:40.940 --> 05:43.074
<i>Tool time!</i>
That's right.

05:43.075 --> 05:47.645
Binford tools is proud to
present tim "the tool man"
taylor! Whoo!

05:47.646 --> 05:49.280
<i>(cheering)</i>

05:52.952 --> 05:54.919
Thank you, heidi.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.788
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

05:57.789 --> 06:01.192
Y'all know my assistant,
al "god knows what's under
that beard" borland.

06:03.395 --> 06:06.697
Today al and I
will be talking about fencing.

06:06.698 --> 06:10.201
In order to do that,
I'm gonna need my dueling dowel.

06:10.202 --> 06:13.071
Heidi?
Here you go, tim.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.773
Thanks, heidi.
You're welcome.

06:18.910 --> 06:22.246
En garde, big fella.
Come on, flannel man.
Tim.

06:22.247 --> 06:24.315
Tim. Tim.

06:24.316 --> 06:25.749
He's scared.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.752
This is not the type of fencing
we're talking about.

06:28.753 --> 06:31.289
We're talking
about the classic...

06:54.146 --> 06:56.547
<i>(audience gasps)</i>

06:56.548 --> 06:58.149
<i>(applause)</i>

07:01.953 --> 07:05.356
Fencing champion,
gilmore high, 1976.

07:05.357 --> 07:08.626
Al and I have done this
to prove a point.
No, we haven't.

07:08.627 --> 07:11.362
Just as al defended
himself against me,

07:11.363 --> 07:13.864
A sturdy fence is a great way
to defend your home -

07:13.865 --> 07:17.101
The best way to keep out dogs,
cats and a pesky neighbor.

07:17.102 --> 07:20.905
The good thing is,
you don't have to be a master
carpenter to build one.

07:20.906 --> 07:23.174
A big plus for you, tim.
Could be.

07:23.175 --> 07:26.044
As I said, this is the classic
alternate-board fence.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.113
We wanna show you how
to keep that fence plumb.

07:29.114 --> 07:31.549
For that, we need a jig.
Tim, the jig?

07:31.550 --> 07:33.551
<i>(â™ª hums jig)</i>

07:40.559 --> 07:44.328
This will help keep
your fence plumb,
as well as help with spacing.

07:44.329 --> 07:46.564
While al's fiddling
around with his plumb,

07:46.565 --> 07:49.200
I'll discuss another way
to stop a pesky neighbor.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.102
You guessed it,
electrical shock.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.970
<i>(laughter)</i>

07:52.971 --> 07:56.674
To demonstrate that,
we've installed
an invisible doggy fence.

07:56.675 --> 07:59.410
We have?
Yes. Right through
the floor here.

07:59.411 --> 08:03.314
Now, foo foo
wears a special collar.

08:03.315 --> 08:06.717
When attached to him,
it activates the fence.

08:06.718 --> 08:09.287
If foo foo were dumb
enough to try to stray,

08:09.288 --> 08:11.489
He gets a mild,
correctional shock.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.791
Grr.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.659
<i>(buzzing)</i>
<i>(yelping)</i>

08:15.660 --> 08:17.661
Grr!

08:17.662 --> 08:19.430
<i>(buzzing)</i>
<i>(yelping)</i>

08:19.431 --> 08:24.001
Now, this will work on
that pesky neighbor...

08:24.002 --> 08:27.338
If you can get him
to wear the collar.
<i>(laughter)</i>

08:27.339 --> 08:29.740
Al, won't you be my neighbor?

08:29.741 --> 08:31.242
<i>(laughter and applause)</i>

08:33.245 --> 08:36.514
I don't think so, tim.
Let's get back
to building that fence.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.815
We're gonna need more slats,

08:37.816 --> 08:40.784
So if you'll walk over
and grab those slats for me,

08:40.784 --> 08:42.553
We can finish it.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.555
Sure thing.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.364
Could you get me
those nails there, tim?

09:02.574 --> 09:03.941
<i>(buzzing)</i>

09:03.942 --> 09:05.943
<i>(laughter)</i>

09:09.815 --> 09:12.883
So I said to the salesman,
"either give me a new pair
of pantyhose,

09:12.884 --> 09:14.952
Or I'll strangle
you with these."

09:14.953 --> 09:18.289
Marie, you are
so good with people.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.090
You know,
you gotta love you.

09:20.091 --> 09:22.426
I learned that in therapy.

09:22.427 --> 09:25.596
This may come as a surprise
to you, but I used to be
a meek person.

09:25.597 --> 09:28.432
Oh, so was I.
Until we moved to texas.

09:28.433 --> 09:31.335
You can't be meek in texas -
it's a state law.

09:33.004 --> 09:35.606
Can you get this?
Oh, yeah.

09:35.607 --> 09:39.210
Thanks a lot, jill.
I know I'll find ours
as soon as I finish unpacking.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.112
Don't worry about it.
We always have extra toasters.

09:42.113 --> 09:45.349
Tim goes through them quickly.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

09:45.350 --> 09:49.019
How about a piece of cake?
I'd love some.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.854
But I really shouldn't -

09:50.855 --> 09:52.890
My therapist says
I have food issues.

09:52.891 --> 09:55.526
Oh, please!
Who doesn't?

09:55.527 --> 09:59.096
So you're in therapy?
Yeah. Started two weeks ago.

09:59.097 --> 10:01.265
I got a coupon.

10:03.101 --> 10:06.170
Discount therapy!
This is an interesting idea.

10:06.171 --> 10:07.471
Maybe I shouldn't tempt you.

10:07.472 --> 10:12.343
What does that therapist know?
He accepts coupons!

10:12.344 --> 10:14.545
So how about
a little piece, then?

10:14.546 --> 10:17.281
How about a big hunk?
Ok!

10:17.282 --> 10:20.751
Tim, I want you to come
over here and meet marie.

10:20.752 --> 10:24.822
She's volunteered to help me
with the library fundraiser.
You finally hooked somebody.

10:24.823 --> 10:27.658
Yeah. I got a piece of
cake out of the deal, too.
Nice to meet you, marie.

10:27.659 --> 10:29.360
Hi, handsome.
Thank you.
There you go.

10:29.361 --> 10:31.895
I want to sit and chitchat, but
I'm gonna go put the grill on.

10:31.896 --> 10:33.130
I'll show it to you later.

10:33.131 --> 10:35.366
I thought you already
did that today.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.535
I didn't tell you.
I met our new neighbor,

10:37.536 --> 10:41.439
Mr. Meat man, mr. Obnoxious.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.042
This guy comes over,
breaks the grill...

10:45.043 --> 10:47.578
Did he happen
to give you a pen?

10:47.579 --> 10:49.647
Yeah, with a big cow on.
Know the guy?

10:49.648 --> 10:52.916
Mm, I'm married to him.
Oh, yeah!

10:56.488 --> 11:01.292
Wait a minute.
I said "obnoxious" -
I meant "gregarious."

11:01.293 --> 11:03.193
Listen, no need
to explain to me.

11:03.194 --> 11:05.963
I call him a lot worse,
believe me.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.965
I gotta go home, jill.
I gotta cook some supper.

11:07.966 --> 11:10.234
But you didn't finish your cake!
I'm taking it with me.

11:10.235 --> 11:13.804
Oh, ok. I'll walk you out.
All right.
See you later, dollface.

11:13.805 --> 11:15.839
Nice to meet you.
Oh, tim.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.009
While I'm gone, can you try to
get your foot out of your mouth?

11:20.379 --> 11:23.614
I'm gonna pound you!
Hey, hey, cut it out.

11:23.615 --> 11:26.751
You're supposed to be setting
the table. What's going on?

11:26.752 --> 11:31.221
Word got out about
lover boy's idea to meet girls.

11:31.222 --> 11:34.458
Every guy in the seventh grade
signed up for home ec.

11:36.795 --> 11:42.633
Dad, they put us in separate
class - 30 boys and no girls.

11:42.634 --> 11:45.703
And we have to sew!

11:45.704 --> 11:47.371
I'd like to help you out, brad,
I really would.

11:47.372 --> 11:50.508
But I got a whole drawer full
of socks that need darning.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.842
Man!

11:51.843 --> 11:54.878
And maybe after that
you can crochet me a sweater.

11:54.879 --> 11:56.614
Yeah.

11:56.615 --> 12:00.050
You gotta still set that table!
No running in the house!

12:00.051 --> 12:02.620
Nice going, as usual, tim!

12:02.621 --> 12:06.390
I smoothed it over, though.
We're having dinner with
joe and marie on Saturday.

12:06.391 --> 12:09.527
We don't wanna do that!

12:09.528 --> 12:11.329
I do. I like marie.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.364
I don't like joe.
You don't know that guy.

12:13.365 --> 12:15.333
You only spent a couple
of minutes with him.

12:15.334 --> 12:18.336
And he's loud, obnoxious,
thinks he knows about cars.

12:18.337 --> 12:21.205
Why does this sound familiar?

12:21.206 --> 12:26.377
Oh, look, you like marie?
Why don't you go out with marie?

12:26.378 --> 12:29.313
Come on, they're new
in the neighborhood.
They don't know anybody.

12:29.314 --> 12:32.583
Besides, it's an opportunity for
us to go out with another couple
for a change.

12:32.584 --> 12:35.720
Well, pick another couple.
How about jack and suzanne?

12:35.721 --> 12:37.722
They don't like you.

12:40.024 --> 12:42.393
We could go out with
the couple we went out
with last weekend?

12:42.394 --> 12:45.696
Al and his mother
do not constitute a couple.

12:47.799 --> 12:50.968
Al's mother by herself
constitutes a couple.
"where's the meat?"

12:53.538 --> 12:54.805
You're going!

13:05.884 --> 13:09.253
Grr!

13:09.254 --> 13:11.655
I'll tell you what.
Let's just go to the salad bar -

13:11.656 --> 13:13.557
We can be out of here
in one hour.

13:13.558 --> 13:15.092
Oh, right.
And if we don't chew,

13:15.093 --> 13:17.127
We can be out of here
in five minutes.

13:19.264 --> 13:22.065
Hey, tool man!
Oh!

13:22.066 --> 13:23.967
Finally, I'm meeting
mrs. Tool man.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.202
Honey, honey,
her name's jill.

13:25.203 --> 13:28.071
Hey, jill.
Hi, joe.

13:28.072 --> 13:30.207
Come here.
I'm a hugger.
I'm a shaker.

13:32.611 --> 13:34.478
Sit down!
Sit down, please.

13:34.479 --> 13:36.714
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.182
Tonight everything's
on the meat man.

13:39.183 --> 13:43.253
Don't look at the prices.
Order whatever you want.
Ah, chicken I'll have.

13:43.254 --> 13:46.524
You don't come to a place like
the chuck house for chicken.
You want steak.

13:46.525 --> 13:47.792
Honey, let him order
what he wants.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.727
Why don't you try
the steak?

13:49.728 --> 13:52.362
I don't want the steak.
I'd like the chicken.

13:52.363 --> 13:55.699
But you can get
chicken anywhere.
I like the chicken here.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.068
No, you want the steak here.
They make it so rare,

13:58.069 --> 14:00.771
You need eight rolls
to sop up the blood.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.374
I think I'll have the chicken.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.844
Jill, you gotta have the steak.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.813
It's just what the doctor
ordered for your condition.

14:08.814 --> 14:11.615
What condition?
Tell us about the steaks.

14:11.616 --> 14:15.018
I told you,
she doesn't have a condition.
Tim said she did.

14:15.019 --> 14:19.423
He's right you can go anywhere
for chicken. Let's have steaks.

14:19.424 --> 14:22.326
And what condition
would that be, tim?

14:22.327 --> 14:23.594
Tim said you got no pep

14:23.595 --> 14:26.664
And you stay in bed
for days at a time.

14:26.665 --> 14:30.601
And why did you say that?!
I didn't say that.

14:30.602 --> 14:32.436
Yeah, you did.
I did not.

14:32.437 --> 14:34.104
Then what did you say?

14:38.376 --> 14:41.812
I was in the garage. I can't
remember what I say in the
garage 'cause of the fumes.

14:43.648 --> 14:46.049
Look, the drinks are here.
Oh, boy.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.152
We didn't order any drinks.
Joe took the liberty.

14:49.153 --> 14:51.622
For the three of us,
I got cabernet sauvignon.

14:51.623 --> 14:54.658
And for you, jill,
I got, uh... This.

14:54.659 --> 14:58.629
What is this?
It's a shirley temple.

14:58.630 --> 15:02.232
Yeah, tim told me about
your other little problem.

15:05.136 --> 15:08.973
Excuse me, waitress?
Can you bring us
some extra rolls, please?

15:08.974 --> 15:11.274
I'm gonna need 'em
to sop up all the blood.

15:16.314 --> 15:18.182
<i>(horror film on tv)</i>

15:29.227 --> 15:31.629
I'm never gonna finish
this stupid hat.

15:31.630 --> 15:36.500
Well, then you won't get
a chance to make the skirt
that goes with it.

15:36.501 --> 15:38.669
How'd you like a split lip?

15:38.670 --> 15:42.472
Great. You'd get extra credit
for sewing it back up.

15:42.473 --> 15:46.710
Hey, hey! All right, all right!
Cool down, you guys.

15:46.711 --> 15:48.646
Randy, don't make fun
of your brother.

15:48.647 --> 15:53.684
Sewing is a valuable skill
that has served me well.

15:53.685 --> 15:57.487
You know how to sew?
You're darn tootin'!

15:57.488 --> 16:01.258
And I learned to sew
in the navy.

16:01.259 --> 16:03.260
I didn't know
you were in the navy.

16:03.261 --> 16:05.195
Signed up when I was 18.

16:05.196 --> 16:08.165
Wanted to travel the world,
cast my fortune to the wind,

16:08.166 --> 16:10.500
Sail the seven seas.

16:10.501 --> 16:13.270
Where'd you sail?

16:13.271 --> 16:16.306
Nowhere.

16:16.307 --> 16:18.609
I was stationed
in fallon, nevada.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.112
<i>(garage door opening)</i>

16:22.113 --> 16:23.647
Holy smokes,
your folks are home!

16:23.648 --> 16:26.750
Quick, turn that off.
Get up to bed.

16:26.751 --> 16:28.452
Mark! Mark, wake up.

16:28.453 --> 16:31.855
Wake up,
you gotta go to sleep.

16:31.856 --> 16:34.324
But I <i>was</i> sleeping.

16:36.895 --> 16:40.430
Hi. Hey.
So, how was the evening?

16:40.431 --> 16:43.333
Great. I'm hungry.
I thought you went
out to dinner.

16:43.334 --> 16:46.269
His steak was a little rare.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.906
A little rare?
That steak had a bell on it!

16:52.844 --> 16:54.211
Where are those cookies?

16:54.212 --> 16:56.513
I ate them.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.115
All of 'em?

16:58.116 --> 17:01.018
You're not paying me. You said
I could eat whatever I wanted.

17:01.019 --> 17:04.521
Don't pay any
attention to him.

17:04.521 --> 17:09.259
He's probably just upset
because his wife has severe
emotional problems.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.561
I told joe that to get
him out of the garage.
We've discussed this.

17:12.563 --> 17:15.265
So you said,
"my wife is a slug"?

17:16.835 --> 17:19.502
I was desperate.
Where are those little sausages?

17:21.705 --> 17:24.508
Al, tim told our
new neighbors

17:24.509 --> 17:28.512
That I was a depressed
alcoholic with a sleeping
disorder.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.981
Only an insensitive jerk
would have repeated that.

17:30.982 --> 17:33.450
If you wanted those sausages,
you should have told me.

17:33.451 --> 17:35.519
Would you shut up?!

17:35.520 --> 17:38.956
This isn't al's problem.
No, the problem is the meat man.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.224
No, the problem is your
brain serves no function

17:41.225 --> 17:43.193
Other than keeping your
head from caving in!

17:50.301 --> 17:52.302
<i>(softly)</i> wilson.

17:53.504 --> 17:55.338
Wilson!

17:58.009 --> 17:59.342
Wilson.

18:10.021 --> 18:13.123
Tim?
Wilson, you up?

18:14.759 --> 18:16.827
I am now.

18:16.828 --> 18:18.929
Have you ever had
a real annoying neighbor?

18:24.803 --> 18:27.071
Tim, is this
a trick question?

18:29.007 --> 18:31.108
No, I'm talking about
that guy next door to me.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.043
He just moved in - joe.

18:33.044 --> 18:35.512
He's already bugging me.

18:37.048 --> 18:39.649
I know the feeling, tim.

18:39.650 --> 18:42.419
That guy is such
a pain in the butt.

18:42.420 --> 18:44.454
Just being around him
gives me a headache.

18:44.455 --> 18:47.324
Tim, you wouldn't happen to have
an aspirin on you, would you?

18:47.325 --> 18:49.893
What would you do?

18:49.894 --> 18:53.063
Well, what I would do,
when I'm face-to face with
an irksome individual,

18:53.064 --> 18:56.900
I always say look
for the good in people.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.904
Huh. And that works?
Most of the time.

19:00.905 --> 19:02.505
And if it doesn't...

19:02.506 --> 19:03.941
I take his ball away.

19:11.716 --> 19:14.017
Hey, tool man.
<i>(clank)</i>

19:14.018 --> 19:15.685
Boy, you're jumpy!

19:15.686 --> 19:17.487
Do you ever use
the front door, joe?

19:17.488 --> 19:19.823
You really got me
in hot water with your wife.

19:19.824 --> 19:22.793
I kept trying to figure out why
you'd tell me a lie like that.

19:22.794 --> 19:26.563
Then it comes to me.

19:26.564 --> 19:30.067
You're having an affair, right?
No, I'm not having an affair.

19:30.068 --> 19:34.037
Ok, then I know what it is.
You hate me.

19:34.038 --> 19:35.672
I wouldn't say that...

19:35.673 --> 19:38.475
Hey, don't apologize.

19:38.476 --> 19:40.343
I know the meat man
comes on strong sometimes.

19:40.344 --> 19:42.445
I'm not everybody's
cut of beef.

19:44.348 --> 19:46.349
I'm sorry.

19:46.350 --> 19:49.552
Hey, look. I'm the one
who should apologize
for that stupid story.

19:49.553 --> 19:52.489
Well, I should learn
how to let people eat chicken.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.925
Anyway, tool man,
I got something for you.

19:54.926 --> 19:57.161
That's all right, joe.
You didn't need to do that.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.565
Hey!

20:02.566 --> 20:04.701
Hey!

20:04.702 --> 20:06.236
This is an original '33.

20:06.237 --> 20:09.706
Yeah, well, I felt real bad
about denting your fake one.

20:12.243 --> 20:15.979
These are impossible to find.
I looked for two years.
Not for the meat man.

20:15.980 --> 20:18.148
I called in a few favors,
drove to ohio,

20:18.149 --> 20:20.818
Bingo-bango,
you got yourself a grill.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.420
The grill of my dreams!

20:25.556 --> 20:30.260
This must have cost a fortune.
Don't worry about it.
I'm doing great.

20:30.261 --> 20:33.797
When the hot rod's all done,
give me a spin around the block,
we'll call it even, ok?

20:33.798 --> 20:36.266
You got it.
See you around, buddy.

20:38.102 --> 20:40.503
Thanks, joe.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.741
Was that joe's
voice I heard?
Yeah.

20:44.742 --> 20:46.376
Look what he did.

20:46.377 --> 20:50.580
He found an original grill
for the '33 - an original!

20:50.581 --> 20:54.484
You know, like I always say,

20:54.485 --> 20:58.322
You just gotta find
the good in people.

20:58.323 --> 21:00.290
So now you like
the meat man?

21:00.291 --> 21:02.392
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah, I like meat man.

21:02.393 --> 21:06.930
And honey, I apologize for
making up that stupid story.
I was out of line.

21:06.931 --> 21:11.168
But you know what?
If you and marie want
to go out as a couples, I'm in.

21:11.169 --> 21:14.371
Marie and I definitely
wanna go out as couples.
All right.

21:14.372 --> 21:16.773
We just gotta find
two other guys.

21:21.246 --> 21:25.849
Yeah, jerry. Oh, you want us
to see your vacation videos?

21:25.850 --> 21:28.818
Oh, that's too bad.
We can't do it.

21:28.819 --> 21:31.488
No, no. Tim's working late.

21:31.489 --> 21:33.924
No, he's not here.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.094
I'm so sorry.
Maybe some other time.

21:37.095 --> 21:40.230
Ok, bye-bye.

21:40.231 --> 21:44.467
Liar, liar,
bra's on fire!

21:44.468 --> 21:46.303
So you wanna go to over
to jerry and sheila's,

21:46.304 --> 21:48.671
And watch them argue
their way through europe?

21:48.672 --> 21:51.975
That's not the point.
Why is it I can't lie about you
and you can lie about me?

21:51.976 --> 21:54.878
Because I'm better at it!

21:54.879 --> 21:58.348
Tim, if you're gonna
lie about me, you have
to use common sense.

21:58.349 --> 22:02.752
Wait. Hold on.
We have to find
another guideline.

22:02.753 --> 22:05.789
Why don't we just sit down
and discuss acceptable lies
and non-acceptable lies.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.392
Ok, ok. I'll give you some,
all right?

22:08.393 --> 22:10.193
Lie number one...

22:10.194 --> 22:12.529
"I can't go out tonight

22:12.530 --> 22:16.499
Because my wife is accepting
a mother of the year award."

22:18.436 --> 22:21.704
Ok.
All right,
lie number two.

22:21.705 --> 22:25.943
"I can't go out tonight
because my wife is finishing
her third book."

22:25.944 --> 22:29.446
Reading it or writing it?
Very funny!

22:29.447 --> 22:32.382
All right,
I'm getting the vibe.

22:32.383 --> 22:36.019
"we can't go out tonight
because my wife is braiding
her back hair."

22:41.759 --> 22:43.560
Not acceptable!
A little over the top?

22:43.561 --> 22:44.962
Yeah.
All right.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.830
"I can't go out tonight
because my wife will be

22:46.831 --> 22:49.132
Hugging me and smothering me
in romantic kisses."

22:49.133 --> 22:51.734
Acceptable,
but nauseating.
Ok.

22:56.407 --> 23:00.410
I always say look
for the good in people.

23:00.411 --> 23:02.512
And that works?
Most of the time.

23:02.513 --> 23:04.647
And if it doesn't...

23:04.648 --> 23:07.384
I miss the ball!

23:07.385 --> 23:11.788
I always say look
for the good in people.

23:11.789 --> 23:13.991
And that works?
Most of the time.
