<i>Please enjoy the music</i>
<i>while your party is reached.</i>

00:28.895 --> 00:30.328
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- So what do you think?</i>

00:30.430 --> 00:32.591
<i>- About what?</i>
<i>- About tomorrow.</i>

00:32.698 --> 00:34.189
<i>It's our first day of high school.</i>

00:34.300 --> 00:37.736
<i>If we want to be popular,</i>
<i>we just have to be proactive.</i>

00:37.837 --> 00:39.668
<i>Calm your proactive ass down.</i>

00:39.773 --> 00:43.174
<i>Saying you want to be popular</i>
<i>guarantees it isn't gonna happen.</i>

00:43.276 --> 00:45.836
I'm gonna get a girlfriend.
You think that's possible?

00:45.945 --> 00:47.936
Anything's possible, Wade.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.037
<i>Just don't be needy.</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:51.640
<i>You got to let it come to you.</i>
<i>And one more thing.</i>

00:51.818 --> 00:55.185
From now on,
I don't want you calling me Ryan.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.290
Call me T-Dog.

00:59.259 --> 01:00.726
- T-Dog?
- Yep.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.056
- What does the "T" stand for?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

01:04.164 --> 01:06.223
- But it sounds better than R-Dog.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:06.332 --> 01:08.960
You know, like, if a hot girl
went up to you, and she goes,

01:09.069 --> 01:13.096
"Hey, have you met T-Dog?
Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?

01:13.206 --> 01:15.800
"Man, that T-Dog is crazy!"

01:15.909 --> 01:18.469
<i>That sounds like a guy</i>
<i>every woman would want to know.</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:22.514
- Hey, do I need a nickname?
- You have one. Skeletor.

01:22.615 --> 01:25.516
That was last year.
I look good now. I'm filling out.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.950
All right, name one part of your body
that filled out, Wade.

01:28.054 --> 01:30.579
Name one part of your body
that isn't filled out, huh?

01:30.690 --> 01:32.123
I'm not trying to offend you.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.716
<i>I'm just saying you shot up too fast</i>
<i>and you're freakishly skinny.</i>

01:34.828 --> 01:37.092
Oh, yeah? Well, you're too fat
and that's equally unattractive.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.960
- You wanna go there?
- I'm sorry.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.863
It's just, I want things to go well,
you know?

01:41.968 --> 01:44.562
- Sorry I said you're freakishly skinny.
- It's okay.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.002
<i>You just are.</i>

01:46.639 --> 01:49.301
Hey, go to sleep!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

01:49.409 --> 01:50.433
- What are you, crazy?
- Sorry.

01:50.543 --> 01:51.532
<i>- Is that your stepdad?</i>
- No one.

01:51.644 --> 01:52.611
- Give me that phone! Give it!
- It's...

01:52.712 --> 01:55.203
<i>You're in high school now.</i>
<i>Don't take his...</i>

01:55.315 --> 01:56.577
Go to sleep.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.848
How about some
chicks on the walls in here?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.854
It's like a nerd paradise.

02:28.414 --> 02:31.042
Time to make the donuts.

02:34.787 --> 02:35.879
Hoo-rah!

02:38.892 --> 02:40.052
Touchdown!

02:40.393 --> 02:43.021
We won! We won the game!
And Wade loses again!

02:43.129 --> 02:45.097
- Get out of my room!
- Dad said get up.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.665
He's not my dad. He's your dad.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.734
Fine, the guy who does your mom
says get up.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.700
- Just leave!
- Loser!

02:53.673 --> 02:57.666
Morning, sunshine. First day of school.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.145
- Mom!
- Oh, my God!

03:00.246 --> 03:02.077
Since when did you start
sleeping naked?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.912
I'm in high school now,
don't you remember?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.885
I don't like elastic squeezing
on my ass when I sleep!

03:07.987 --> 03:09.011
Okay.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.119
Hey! What are you doing
in this shower?

03:13.226 --> 03:16.354
Dawn? Rachel, that's right.
Nice to see you.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.731
<i>Put your hands up</i>
<i>Put your hands up</i>

03:19.832 --> 03:22.528
<i>I'm the best white rapper</i>
<i>you've ever seen</i>

03:25.238 --> 03:26.364
A hair!

03:34.013 --> 03:35.571
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.343
Thank you, ladies!

03:42.355 --> 03:44.482
What's up, winners? You stoked?
Pedal to the metal?

03:44.591 --> 03:45.580
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:45.692 --> 03:46.659
All right. Who's a winner?

03:46.759 --> 03:47.748
- I am!
- I am!

03:47.860 --> 03:48.849
Morning!

03:50.396 --> 03:52.762
- Look at you, with your magic stick.
- What do you think?

03:52.865 --> 03:54.423
Magic is stupid.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.763
No, no, honey.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.234
- Mom!
- What?

03:58.338 --> 04:00.067
You forgot the sausages!

04:00.573 --> 04:04.100
- I'll get the sausages.
- Come on. I'm hungry.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.871
All right, I'll get the sausages.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.811
Excuse me, listen,
I'm really sorry to bother you.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.507
My family and I, we just ran out of gas

04:10.617 --> 04:12.949
and we're trying to get to the kids
to SeaWorld.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.680
And, I, like an idiot forgot my wallet.
If I can just...

04:15.788 --> 04:18.221
- Your legs work okay?
- Yeah, why?

04:18.324 --> 04:20.416
You should walk somewhere
and get a job.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.187
- Harold...
- I'll take care of it.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.887
That's what I have, a job.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.055
We'll get to SeaWorld
one way or the other.

04:26.165 --> 04:29.532
We're on our way to church.
Maybe that's where you ought to go.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.536
Thank you. Have a great day.

04:31.704 --> 04:33.831
- Can you help out a veteran?
- Not today.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.908
- Get away from the car.
- Honey, roll up the window.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.067
Get away!

04:37.176 --> 04:38.905
- What's your name?
- Drillbit.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.877
Listen, Drillbit, I wasn't born yesterday.

04:40.980 --> 04:45.110
I don't want you using this on
any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?

04:45.218 --> 04:47.778
- You got my word on it.
- You know what?

04:49.355 --> 04:51.789
- I'm gonna write "not for pot" on there.
- You don't have to write.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.018
Yeah. "Not for pot."

04:54.127 --> 04:57.028
You're gonna feel pretty silly if you try
to buy weed with that, won't you?

04:58.164 --> 04:59.859
Remember, put your best foot forward.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.867
People decide what they think about you
in the first five seconds.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.335
So, let me smell your breath.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.427
Minty.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.473
- You swipe on some deodorant?
- Yeah.

05:08.574 --> 05:13.204
- You dust the nuts?
- No, Jim. I did not dust my nuts.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.008
I'll never get tired of that one, Dad.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.207
You know, you should hit the weights
with the boys and me.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.410
- I'll pass.
- We'll get you in the gym.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.511
We'll beef you up. Look at these guys.
Show them. Give him a gun shot.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.180
Give him a crab.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.781
Worship the sun.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.555
- Yeah, look at these guys.
- They're freaks.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.562
Not in my house!

05:31.831 --> 05:33.822
<i>- Have a great day.</i>
- Okay, I love you, Dad.

05:33.933 --> 05:37.027
<i>I love you, too.</i>
<i>Have fun at school, Ryan. Bye.</i>

05:41.207 --> 05:44.574
- So what'd your dad say?
- He told me to have fun.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.008
Wow, great parenting.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.512
I don't know how
we're surviving without him.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.775
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

05:51.317 --> 05:54.377
- He's a piece of shit, anyway.
- Thank you, honey.

05:57.657 --> 06:00.285
<i>- Enchant√©.</i>
- Hello.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.956
You got room for two
in this little speedster?

06:04.063 --> 06:07.692
I am in a rush now. But I hostess up
at Moon Shadows on the one.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.325
So if you get up there just, you know,
ask for me. I'm Jessica.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.370
- Thanks, Jessica.
- Yeah.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.372
'Cause our chef, Louis,
always makes too much chowder.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.500
So he'll set you up with
a nice plastic bowl of it out back.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.349
- You're late today.
- Hey, get a job!

06:23.449 --> 06:26.816
- You get a job.
- I already got one, giving money to you.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.285
- How're you doing, Mrs. Lampanelli?
- All right.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.052
- You look beautiful today.
- You're a liar. But it works for me.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.922
- Go on, get out of here, you nut!
- You earned it.

06:35.027 --> 06:37.621
And don't spend it on food. Porn only!

06:43.102 --> 06:45.093
First day of high school.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.838
- It's kind of scary.
- Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.

06:49.375 --> 06:53.311
Sure, last year we were the oldest
so we got to sit in the back of the bus,

06:53.413 --> 06:57.349
but now we'll probably have to sit
in the front with the losers.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.443
We'll be all right.

07:00.553 --> 07:04.956
You have to have a proactive attitude
if you wanna be popular in high school.

07:05.057 --> 07:08.584
People decide what they think of you
in the first five seconds.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.194
I think you're a dork.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.400
Oh, Wade.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.937
- Oh, no.
- This is uncool.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.870
We can't start high school like this.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.340
You got to be shitting me. Come on.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.571
- Please, am I dreaming here?
- No.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.806
We're never allowed
to buy the same shirt again!

07:28.915 --> 07:30.439
Whoever sees it first gets to buy it.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.178
You guys should wear
red ribbons in your hair, too.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.277
See? We both look like dorks.
Go change.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.754
No! I'm the one who was
planning on wearing this.

07:37.857 --> 07:41.452
Wade, I run the mile in 21 minutes!

07:41.894 --> 07:44.158
How fast do you think I can go?

07:45.765 --> 07:48.199
- Go! Hurry!
- I'm going!

07:50.102 --> 07:52.627
Wade, bus!

07:53.172 --> 07:54.764
- Perfect!
- Come on!

07:55.942 --> 07:58.172
What a way to start high school, huh?

08:02.114 --> 08:04.275
Let me guess.
Two-for-one sale at Hot Topic?

08:04.383 --> 08:06.851
- Losers!
- Dorks!

08:06.953 --> 08:08.318
We're dead.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.226
First day of our high school careers.

08:19.765 --> 08:23.565
All right, let's light this fuse
and see what happens.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.631
- Let's go, man.
- All right.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.172
Are you guys part of a bowling team?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.707
Last one.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.842
Hey, at least it'll be easy
to find each other.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.888
Yeah. I'll just look
for the kid with the same shirt.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.556
- Come on!
- No, you have to spin it a few times first

08:51.664 --> 08:52.961
to get it to work.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.793
Thank you.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.600
No, wait! Wait!

09:04.010 --> 09:06.035
- What are you guys doing? Guys!
- Now, shut it. Move!

09:06.145 --> 09:07.510
- No, thanks.
- Guys!

09:07.613 --> 09:09.171
- Get out of the way!
- Man!

09:09.282 --> 09:11.682
- Here we go.
- But that... That's not for me.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.274
- That's for my books!
- Okay, here we go.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.353
- In there.
- I am not a book!

09:14.453 --> 09:16.182
- Get in there!
- This is bad.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.917
- This isn't my locker! Please!
- No, this is good.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.152
At least we know we're not
the biggest dorks in school.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.784
- Please, please, please!
- Maybe we should say something.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.157
It's survival of the fittest.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.629
I've got to say something.
I got to. I have to.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.599
Say something? It's hilarious.
The kid fits in the locker. Come on.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.260
- That's not funny.
- Somebody, help!

09:31.370 --> 09:32.701
This is the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.035
- Help! Please!
- Stop!

09:43.549 --> 09:47.713
- I mean, you don't have to, but...
- Harry Potter.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.619
You need to keep your big mouth shut.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.385
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to tell him.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.552
- Hey!
- Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!

09:58.664 --> 10:01.599
Hey, check this out.
Matching shirt geeks.

10:01.701 --> 10:02.861
Oh, my God.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.960
Yo, Ron, these bitches
really wanna wear the same shirt.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.402
Let's make them
wear the same shirt, huh?

10:06.505 --> 10:08.268
Sounds good. Yeah.

10:09.241 --> 10:12.642
The fat one here, the skinny one there,
and just let go.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.103
There.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.507
You better keep that shit on,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.746
'cause if I see you trying to take it off,
you're dead.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.118
And you know what happens
if one of you dies? Both of you dies.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.748
'Cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!

10:33.833 --> 10:34.925
That's very cute.

10:35.034 --> 10:38.003
You look like those Velcro monkeys
who hug each other.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.963
How was school, Wade?

10:42.074 --> 10:44.634
We made so many friends,
I can't even remember all their names.

10:44.744 --> 10:47.577
- Great! You got to be in it to win it.
- I am in it!

10:47.680 --> 10:48.669
Great.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.638
Yeah!

10:52.685 --> 10:54.016
- Yeah.
- So school went well, huh?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.748
Oh, it was great.
It couldn't have gone better.

10:56.856 --> 11:00.155
It was the shirt, right?
I'll have to get you more of those.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.125
Hey! What are you doing?
That's my stuff!

11:04.230 --> 11:05.288
This is city property.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.263
Nobody's supposed to be
camping out here.

11:07.366 --> 11:08.958
Your stuff's in the dumpster
around the corner.

11:09.068 --> 11:13.061
That's where I eat! You don't put
a man's belongings where he eats!

11:13.172 --> 11:16.699
- My taxes pay for your salary.
- You don't pay taxes.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.437
- You don't even have a job.
- What else you wanna remind me of?

11:19.545 --> 11:23.276
That I don't have good health care?
That I don't belong to a good gym?

11:23.382 --> 11:27.182
Where's the compassion?
Protect and serve. That's what it says.

11:27.319 --> 11:29.116
- Compassion?
- Yeah, compassion.

11:29.221 --> 11:31.280
You wanna know
what I have compassion for?

11:31.390 --> 11:35.656
The homeless who are mentally ill,
the homeless who are drug-addicted.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.752
Buddy, you're just a jackass.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.694
Oh, guy hits a little bit of bump
in the road and he's a jackass?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.564
Maybe I should go smoke some crack
and get your sympathy.

11:43.669 --> 11:46.103
- Go back to the Village People!
- Back up!

11:46.205 --> 11:47.229
Damn!

11:48.774 --> 11:52.073
All right, today is the first day
of our high school careers.

11:52.611 --> 11:53.942
Yes, it is.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.018
There she is.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.784
That's the girl who came up to me
at my locker.

12:07.193 --> 12:11.289
- Well, make your move.
- What move? I don't have a move.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.606
All right, thanks for signing up.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.112
How're you doing?

12:30.216 --> 12:32.150
Is this your first time signing up
for the Heritage Club?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.311
- Yeah, it is. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.390
What'd you sign up for?

12:41.494 --> 12:45.988
- Photography and Asian Heritage.
- Asian Heritage, huh?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.588
- I like your commitment.
- Yeah.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.225
- I like it a lot.
- Hey, buddies! Remember me?

12:51.370 --> 12:53.895
- Hi.
- Oh, Jesus H.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.499
Oh, God.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.968
Guys, why aren't you wearing them?

13:00.079 --> 13:03.344
- Why are you talking to us?
- I just wanted to say thank you

13:03.449 --> 13:05.041
for helping me out yesterday and all.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.676
You guys are definitely the type of
people I'm gonna want to hang out with.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.017
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Emmit Oosterhaus, by the way.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.249
- Hi.
- Wade. That's T-Dog.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.384
T-Dog? Dude,
that's a really cool nickname.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.621
Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?

13:17.730 --> 13:19.755
We need to ditch this guy.
He's like a stray cat.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.628
Once you feed him,
he'll never go away, okay?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.429
Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.763
I'm off to U.S. History.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.030
- U.S. History.
- Hey, look!

13:26.138 --> 13:28.732
The Siamese queers had a baby.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.968
I guess that makes them triplets,
now doesn't it?

13:31.076 --> 13:33.909
Well, actually,
we still wouldn't be triplets, see.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.578
You see, they'd be my parents,
and I'd be the baby.

13:36.682 --> 13:37.808
Don't get smart with me.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.717
I said you're triplets and I think that
you guys need to get into his shirt

13:41.821 --> 13:43.584
- and be triplets.
- We can do that.

13:43.689 --> 13:46.283
You know what? Emmit, shut up.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.361
Look, you really have to
do this crap, guys?

13:49.461 --> 13:52.328
Come on, give us a break.
It's the second day of school.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.763
Hey, I like this kid. Yeah.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.902
Double Stuf's got an attitude.

14:00.773 --> 14:04.140
Yeah. We have to do this shit
because it's hilarious.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.203
This school is boring.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.146
Watching you freak out amuses me.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.850
And, yeah, it's just the second day
of school. So guess what?

14:14.954 --> 14:20.290
It's gonna keep coming
and coming and coming!

14:25.030 --> 14:26.122
Party time!

14:26.899 --> 14:29.265
- Stop peeing on me!
- Wait! Wait! No!

14:35.374 --> 14:37.103
He pissed himself. What a loser.

14:47.586 --> 14:48.553
Help.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.514
Help me!

14:54.326 --> 14:57.625
- Is that Mario Lopez, dude?
- Whoever he is, he's cute!

15:01.166 --> 15:03.066
Take his pants off! Pants off!

15:20.786 --> 15:24.313
- Up, down, up...
- Write your name!

15:31.330 --> 15:33.958
No! Please, don't! No! Don't!

15:40.673 --> 15:41.662
Bernie?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.404
- Come on, give me one match, here.
- That's funny.

15:47.513 --> 15:48.878
- All I need is one.
- Yeah, I like it.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.472
- Will you just give up?
- Damn it! Look at that.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.212
God, I can't even get one card!
Not one thing!

15:55.321 --> 15:58.586
State of California just robbed me, Don.
You saw it.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.058
You'd think... Where's my quarter?
Did you see my...

16:04.163 --> 16:05.994
- You're always looking at me.
- Is the pill bottle... I forget,

16:06.098 --> 16:09.363
- is that the castle or is that a rook?
- Don, did you just take my quarter?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.868
No, I didn't take your quarter, Drillbit.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.962
Not my fault you can't keep track
of your finances.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.405
I don't know why you're spending all
your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.136
You're unbelievable.
I got to get out of here.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.508
You know,
I can't take this anymore, man.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.309
Rich people don't like us,

16:24.416 --> 16:26.043
and the tourists are scared of us.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.642
- When they see Bernie, they're terrified.
- Terrified.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.450
They're not scared of me, I'm sexy.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.149
- Sanitizer?
- Yeah.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.191
Yeah. Thanks, man.

16:35.627 --> 16:39.529
I just get... I'm like a bird.
I just wanna fly north. I want to...

16:40.566 --> 16:42.534
I'd like to go to Canada.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.598
What was it last year? I think it was,

16:44.703 --> 16:46.500
- "I was gonna go to Iceland."
- Reykjav√≠k.

16:46.605 --> 16:47.594
- No, no.
- Where's that?

16:47.706 --> 16:50.641
Yeah, but the thing about Canada,
if you go high enough north...

16:50.743 --> 16:52.233
- That's right.
...the government pays you

16:52.344 --> 16:53.743
- to take the land.
- That's the truth.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.508
Yeah. Lookit, man,
the beer's twice as strong.

16:56.615 --> 16:59.413
They don't lock the doors,
that should appeal to a man like you.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.713
And what about
a British Columbian girl?

17:01.820 --> 17:04.084
Does that sound like
a pretty potent mix?

17:04.189 --> 17:06.281
Yeah, that's not too bad.
I kind of like that.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.858
Okay, now, man, check this out.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.861
One-way flight to Canada, $287.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.329
You got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing,
what're they called,

17:13.432 --> 17:15.262
- the Federales, the...
- Mounties.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.698
Another...
I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.

17:20.806 --> 17:25.573
So we're talking $387 and it's a new
life for your old <i>hombre,</i> Drillbit.

17:25.676 --> 17:28.441
I dig it, man. Follow the dream.
Chase that thing.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.310
How you gonna come up
with that kind of money, though?

17:30.416 --> 17:31.542
Get a job.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.118
I was an Army Ranger.
There are a lot of people dying for that.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.949
Watch this kid play Hendrix.
He really jams. Look at him.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.523
Oh, yeah, there he goes.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.649
Yeah, I like how he looks
a little bit like Hendrix.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.058
Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.997
- I'll give him a couple bucks.
- A buck? Give him a compliment, man!

17:48.100 --> 17:49.067
Give me a buck!

18:06.418 --> 18:07.851
Why is he in my house?

18:07.953 --> 18:11.013
Are we trying to attract
after-school bullies?

18:11.123 --> 18:13.455
I'm here because
Wade invited me to be here.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.652
Because I'm your friend now.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.828
This fantasy land you live in,
Emmit, are there rides?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.526
Stop picking on him, all right?
This is our guy.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.124
I don't want him to be our guy.

18:24.236 --> 18:28.036
Well, the good news is, I think I found
a solution to our problems.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.865
- Kill Emmit?
- No, bear with me.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.706
This might sound stupid,
but I was on the Internet last night

18:33.812 --> 18:37.714
and there's a bunch of sites where
we can hire a professional bodyguard.

18:37.816 --> 18:41.274
- What do you mean by bodyguard?
- Like he beats up kids that bother us.

18:41.386 --> 18:45.322
A bodyguard? Wade,
that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.654
We should just be men
and fight these kids!

18:47.759 --> 18:49.090
Are you serious?

18:50.496 --> 18:53.226
Of course not. I've never been in a fight.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.867
Have you seen those
high school fights on YouTube?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.527
Kids are brutal.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.808
He gave us an earthquake
when we were peeing in the urinal.

19:03.909 --> 19:04.898
He shoved me in a locker.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.741
And he put my head in his shirt
and called us Siamese queers.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.017
How's that funny?

19:14.119 --> 19:16.917
It's not funny. It's just, it's rare that,

19:17.022 --> 19:18.785
you know,
kids say things that surprise me.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.792
Siamese queers.
I'd never heard that one.

19:24.563 --> 19:28.021
- What would you like me to do?
- We really just want it to stop.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.331
So are they pretty much free to say
whatever they want?

19:31.436 --> 19:33.734
Or am I allowed to defend myself?

19:34.973 --> 19:38.033
Oh, no. Principal Doppler,
I thought this was gonna be anonymous.

19:38.143 --> 19:42.341
In this country, we give the accused
the chance to face his accusers.

19:42.447 --> 19:43.937
Terry, come over here for a second,
will you?

19:44.049 --> 19:46.813
Now we've known each other for...
Yeah, have a seat.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.150
- What's your take on this?
- Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.324
Be polite! There you go.

19:53.725 --> 19:54.851
- Wade.
- Hi.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.087
Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.291
Yeah. Principal Doppler, sir,
I was really excited

20:01.400 --> 20:04.392
about starting this new school year.
I'm not gonna lie.

20:04.803 --> 20:08.364
Who knows?
I, maybe, was hazing them a little bit,

20:09.408 --> 20:10.875
but I'm sorry.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.274
I really am.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.279
You know, I appreciate you taking
responsibility. It's refreshing.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.611
- He doesn't mean it!
- We need to call his parents in.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.981
- Now.
- He doesn't have any parents.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.055
Well, not in this country, anyway.
They live in Hong Kong.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.954
- He's an emancipated minor.
- What does that mean?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.323
It means he's legally an adult.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.455
He answers to no one.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.259
He's above the law.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.901
- What a nightmare, huh?
- Yeah.

20:39.738 --> 20:40.727
Oh, crap.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.029
Oh, no.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.703
- Run.
- Go! Go!

20:47.813 --> 20:49.781
- Run! Go, go!
- Hurry.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.508
Wait for me!

21:09.534 --> 21:10.694
Go, go!

21:15.807 --> 21:17.502
- Do you think he sees us?
- No.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.322
Open the door! Open the door!

21:31.423 --> 21:32.549
What do they want?

21:32.658 --> 21:35.092
Just keep driving, Mom.
It's none of our business.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.433
Let's go, let's go!

22:02.587 --> 22:05.556
Have you guys lost your mind?
Come on, let's go!

22:06.291 --> 22:07.622
Go, go, come on!

22:11.363 --> 22:12.990
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

22:13.465 --> 22:15.558
- Run! Run!
- Go!

22:16.702 --> 22:18.226
Get them, baby!

22:22.374 --> 22:23.807
There! The garage!

22:46.998 --> 22:48.522
You gonna rat on me, boys?

22:48.633 --> 22:51.431
Try to get my parents involved
in this situation?

22:52.137 --> 22:56.005
Now I have to make it my mission
to destroy you punks!

22:56.108 --> 22:59.509
Hey! You kids get the hell off
my property!

22:59.611 --> 23:02.774
I'm gonna give you three seconds,
then I'm getting my shotgun!

23:02.881 --> 23:05.008
- No!
- You better get out of here right now!

23:05.117 --> 23:07.381
- Please don't!
- No! Please!

23:08.286 --> 23:10.754
One! Two! Three!

23:15.026 --> 23:17.995
- Go! Go!
- And stay out, you gang bangers!

23:29.241 --> 23:31.266
Charles, chai latte up.

23:31.476 --> 23:34.877
- Hey! Get off my computer!
- Keep your shirt on.

23:34.980 --> 23:35.947
Come on.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.548
If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

23:40.652 --> 23:43.212
When it works,
you're going to kiss my ass.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.381
How are we gonna know
which one's the bodyguard?

23:57.569 --> 23:59.764
Have you ever done
this kind of thing before?

23:59.871 --> 24:02.431
I worked for the hardest gangstas
in the world.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.600
Kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.

24:05.377 --> 24:08.175
Hell, I still work for Tupac,
even though he dead.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.572
I am Israeli Military Secret Service
Antiterrorist Squad.

24:13.318 --> 24:16.685
So when I kill this kid,
do you want me to do it quickly,

24:16.788 --> 24:19.279
- or do you want him to suffer?
- Suffer.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.454
If you hire Tiger's Protection Services,

24:23.562 --> 24:25.427
not only do you get the Tiger,

24:25.530 --> 24:28.556
but you get the protection
of his entire pride.

24:31.169 --> 24:32.136
Do you like hip-hop?

24:32.237 --> 24:33.864
What the hell you implying
I like hip-hop for?

24:33.972 --> 24:36.634
'Cause I'm dressed this way?
I like country. You like country?

24:36.741 --> 24:39.904
That's the kind of music I like. Alabama.
Gimme some of that.

24:40.011 --> 24:43.174
Some Brooks and Dunn.
The Dixie Chicks, bitch.

24:46.117 --> 24:48.415
Kids hiring a bodyguard
to take care of a bully?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.044
Stupidest thing I ever heard.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.647
Back in my day, if a kid was getting
beat up, it was called childhood.

24:53.758 --> 24:56.852
Pick somebody, anybody.
I'll go beat their ass

24:56.962 --> 25:01.023
right here, right now, and then you can
ask them for a goddamned reference.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.362
How about you, lady?

25:03.468 --> 25:06.665
I'll kick your ass right now!
Close. Closed.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.969
- Yeah!
- This is very disturbing.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.236
You want an ass kicking?

25:19.184 --> 25:21.175
What do you do
when you're not body guarding?

25:21.286 --> 25:23.516
I work at Raging Waters.

25:23.622 --> 25:27.922
I sense great hesitation.
Wait one moment. Excuse me.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.157
I'm going to borrow this.

25:30.896 --> 25:33.490
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, God damn!

25:35.100 --> 25:37.498
- $2,100 a week.
- $10,000 a week.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.662
We're hoping you'd say, like,
around $100.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.204
- Not interested.
- I hate kids like you.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.903
I can't help you. No one can help you!

25:54.052 --> 25:56.919
- Susan, your double espresso's up.
- I'm Susan.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.464
I'm Drillbit Taylor.

26:18.944 --> 26:23.347
U.S. Army Ranger, black ops operative,
decorated marksman,

26:23.448 --> 26:27.384
- improvised weapons expert.
- Are you still in the military?

26:27.752 --> 26:30.653
I was discharged.
Unauthorized heroism.

26:33.858 --> 26:37.817
Yeah. They call it an army of one
in the ads, but they don't mean it.

26:39.598 --> 26:43.056
Unless they mean the whole army
working together as one.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.534
But they certainly don't want one man
out there kicking ass

26:45.637 --> 26:48.765
like an army of one,
which is the way I took it.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.868
As a bodyguard
I protected three Vice Presidents,

26:53.745 --> 26:57.340
Bobby Brown, Sylvester Stallone...
Not as tough as he looks.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.677
So what's the story?
Who do you guys need protection from?

27:00.785 --> 27:04.084
It should be easy for you.
Just a high school bully.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.987
Yeah. Run into a few of those in my life.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.460
- What'd you do to provoke him?
- Well, he's fat, and he's a dork,

27:11.563 --> 27:13.929
- and I'm awesome.
- Shut up, Wade.

27:14.032 --> 27:17.160
By "awesome" do you mean
scared, skinny and lonely?

27:18.837 --> 27:19.826
Yeah.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.106
Yeah.

27:22.874 --> 27:27.106
- So how do we know you're legit?
- Come here. Go on, come here.

27:27.212 --> 27:28.907
I'm not gonna bite.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.383
I want you to look at my eyes.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.811
Take a good look.

27:37.288 --> 27:41.190
Come here! What do you see?
You looking?

27:43.294 --> 27:46.229
- What the hell have you seen?
- You want some?

27:47.432 --> 27:51.459
These eyes have seen
unspeakable horror.

27:52.737 --> 27:54.068
That's my evidence.

27:54.172 --> 27:58.802
That's how you know if a guy's legit.
You need some evidence, too?

27:59.210 --> 28:01.178
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.

28:01.279 --> 28:04.840
I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark
near the Tannhauser Gate.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.317
Isn't that <i>Blade Runner?</i>

28:08.053 --> 28:10.647
Look closely 'cause it's all in there.

28:13.024 --> 28:13.991
Boo!

28:18.630 --> 28:20.689
So, how much do you charge?

28:21.132 --> 28:24.499
$387 a week.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.229
- One second.
- I say yes.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.269
I'm not even sure if I'm available.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.740
- He's good.
- No! No! He's weird.

28:31.843 --> 28:34.437
You know, we might be able
to work up to that.

28:34.779 --> 28:37.145
But right now, we've only got $83.

28:39.984 --> 28:43.750
Okay, well, give me that now
and we'll figure out the rest later.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.389
You know what this is?

28:49.360 --> 28:50.759
It's a wing.

28:51.629 --> 28:55.895
And you're under it.
All three of you, right there.

28:56.501 --> 28:57.968
Okay, here's the mission plan.

28:58.069 --> 29:02.267
Using my expertise at stealthy
and covert ops, I'll infiltrate the school

29:02.373 --> 29:06.207
where I will watch over you
like the Lord almighty himself.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.938
Careful.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.211
Like the good Lord,
I'm gonna use some mysterious ways,

29:11.316 --> 29:13.784
so you're not always gonna see me,
but I'll be there.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.546
Especially when you don't see me.

29:15.653 --> 29:17.553
But first, I'm gonna need some supplies.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.316
- I want to go in and get...
- Like nunchucks?

29:19.424 --> 29:20.391
Maybe.

29:20.525 --> 29:23.358
But a lot of stuff, I'll just get from
just what's laying around the house.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.450
You'd be surprised.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.463
Anything can be turned into
a weapon of mayhem or destruction.

29:27.565 --> 29:29.863
- Even a puppy?
- Especially a puppy.

29:29.968 --> 29:34.302
Germans used them in World War I.
Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.

29:35.540 --> 29:38.771
They'd attach dynamite to them.
Rommel did it. Jerry bastard.

29:39.277 --> 29:42.110
- Now, listen. One thing that...
- This is my house.

29:42.413 --> 29:43.812
Wow.

29:43.915 --> 29:48.978
- We can go in. Nobody's home.
- Let's hit it. Deploy, soldiers.

29:49.087 --> 29:52.955
- Soldiers? Cool. You hear that, T-Dog?
- Beeline, front door! Single file!

29:53.057 --> 29:54.285
Officers first!

29:57.262 --> 30:00.254
You, get me a bowl of cereal.
Go on. Scram.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.474
- Okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here.
- What for?

30:12.577 --> 30:14.272
You take that,
my mom'll rip my head off!

30:14.379 --> 30:16.040
At ease, Casper!

30:16.247 --> 30:20.013
Okay. Observe its momentary
reflective blinding capabilities.

30:20.618 --> 30:23.610
Bang! You're defenseless.

30:23.721 --> 30:26.053
Silver alloy,
one of the strongest ever constructed.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.149
Probably stop an armor-piercing bullet
at point-blank range.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.694
You don't really think
it could come to that.

30:31.796 --> 30:32.922
You tell me.

30:33.364 --> 30:36.663
Filkins is a whack job.
He almost ran over us with his car!

30:36.768 --> 30:40.704
- He's a menace.
- Yeah, I was my dad's favorite, too.

30:40.805 --> 30:42.932
He once cut a kid's arm off
with a samurai sword.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.838
- Bladed weaponry?
- Yeah.

30:45.210 --> 30:48.737
Okay. I'm not gonna take any chances.
You're now on orange alert.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.643
Okay, now this will be good
for video surveillance.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.449
This is good.

30:54.552 --> 30:56.952
You take the guts out of this
and use it for wiretapping.

30:57.055 --> 31:00.547
I think we can use this as a...
I don't know, as a timekeeping device.

31:00.658 --> 31:02.489
I think I'll wear it on my wrist, possibly.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.824
You think you might need this?

31:05.964 --> 31:08.694
This piece of crap's not worth anything.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.325
As a weapon. It's too obvious.

31:11.436 --> 31:13.666
<i>Testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?</i>

31:13.771 --> 31:16.365
- Testing, one, two.
<i>- Can you come back now?</i>

31:16.474 --> 31:18.806
Guys, you got to go far back!
I can hear you!

31:18.910 --> 31:21.606
<i>Testing, testing, one, two.</i>
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

31:23.081 --> 31:25.049
- They work pretty good.
- These are great.

31:25.149 --> 31:26.138
- Yeah.
- These are invaluable.

31:26.251 --> 31:27.479
- They get a little staticky, though...
- Yeah.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.109
...I think, some places in the house.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.448
Why you need all this stuff for?

31:30.588 --> 31:32.283
I thought we were gonna give
Filkins a beat down.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.482
I am gonna beat him down,

31:33.591 --> 31:35.855
but sometimes
after that first beat down,

31:35.960 --> 31:37.860
then they get a little, you know...
They want a little payback.

31:37.962 --> 31:40.430
I'm home!
Who wants grilled-cheese sandwiches?

31:40.531 --> 31:41.896
- Go! Go! Mom! Mom!
- Okay.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.059
- Exit! Exit!
- Go, out the back, out the back, go.

31:44.168 --> 31:45.692
Just 'cause you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

31:45.803 --> 31:49.466
- Shut the door.
- Act natural. Hey, Mom.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.041
- Hey, Barbara, how you doing?
- Hi, boys.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.734
- Who's your new little friend? Hi.
- Hi.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.471
- Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus.
- Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.342
- He's not our friend.
- Yeah, he is.

31:56.447 --> 31:57.505
He's like our hamster.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.276
Smell like something?

32:01.019 --> 32:03.817
- Ryan? You washing?
- Yeah. You?

32:05.223 --> 32:07.088
It's a funny smell. It's all right.
Grilled-cheese sandwiches.

32:07.725 --> 32:10.523
Hey, come on! Buzz us in!

32:11.562 --> 32:12.722
You're gonna wanna see this!

32:12.830 --> 32:13.990
Big money coming in!

32:14.098 --> 32:16.532
This ain't a bunch of
aluminum cans here.

32:16.634 --> 32:17.794
Where do you want it?
Priceless treasures.

32:17.902 --> 32:19.233
Go set them down there.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.897
So you don't think those kids
are gonna miss this stuff?

32:22.006 --> 32:23.906
No. They got two of everything.

32:24.008 --> 32:27.910
They got the iPod, the iPod Nano.
And I don't care if they do,

32:28.012 --> 32:31.311
'cause after this little transaction,

32:31.416 --> 32:34.817
well, the old Drillbit's taking his act
to the Great White North.

32:34.919 --> 32:37.080
- What?
- Yeah, I'm going to Canada.

32:37.188 --> 32:39.679
Well, that's stupid.
You're gonna cut out now?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.988
- I'm going...
- These kids are a cash cow, Drillbit.

32:43.094 --> 32:45.289
You need to hang in there.
You don't cut and run.

32:45.396 --> 32:47.660
You got to get in there and milk this.

32:47.765 --> 32:49.198
Okay, come on back.

32:49.500 --> 32:53.994
All right, I'll tell you what.
I give you $125 for the whole lot.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.094
What?

32:55.206 --> 32:57.970
I just heard you say
you took it from some kids.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.374
So? Don't get all righteous on me.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.174
Half this store you guys got
from crackheads and thieves.

33:03.281 --> 33:05.442
Hey. Who the hell
do you think you are, man?

33:05.550 --> 33:07.177
Let me tell you something.
Those people are our customers!

33:07.285 --> 33:09.480
We're not that harsh on them,
so you shouldn't be!

33:09.587 --> 33:11.555
How would you like it
if we called you a crackhead?

33:11.656 --> 33:12.987
You have called me one.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.491
- Have we? Have we?
- I think I might have.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.985
<i>- Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in.</i>
- What is that?

33:18.096 --> 33:21.657
I'm sorry, hold it just a second.
D.B. one-four-niner-eight, come in.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.358
- Just take this.
<i>- We just wanted you to know</i>

33:23.468 --> 33:25.402
<i>that Emmit was holding out</i>
<i>on some bar mitzvah money.</i>

33:25.503 --> 33:29.064
<i>Emmit, I don't care how many times you</i>
<i>get bar mitzvahed, you're not a man.</i>

33:29.173 --> 33:30.231
<i>- I am a man.</i>
<i>- No, you're not.</i>

33:30.341 --> 33:32.639
- Drillbit! Milk it, milk it.
<i>- So we'll have another 50 bucks for you</i>

33:32.744 --> 33:34.871
<i>- on Monday.</i>
- Grab the udder and milk it.

33:34.979 --> 33:37.345
Ten-four, good buddy.
I will see you tomorrow.

33:37.448 --> 33:41.179
Commence radio silence in three, two.

33:43.287 --> 33:45.915
Today's the official start
of our high school careers.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.391
Last week's history.
Nothing good came out of last week.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.827
- We became best friends.
- Nothing good came out of last week.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.330
There's the sword. Man, we're so dead.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.732
- Where's Drillbit, Wade?
- Hey. Calvary's here.

33:58.836 --> 34:00.895
- Please, where have you been?
- Yes. What's up, man?

34:01.005 --> 34:03.473
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

34:04.609 --> 34:07.806
We got 40 bucks we promised,
plus we got an extra 17.

34:07.912 --> 34:08.900
I sold my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.206
Okay, this is gonna be sweet.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.177
I can't wait to watch
you kick Filkins' ass.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.377
- Yeah. What, is he here?
- Yeah, over there on his car.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.918
I want you to be
the last face he ever sees.

34:17.021 --> 34:18.079
What are you gonna do?

34:18.188 --> 34:19.713
- What am I gonna do?
- Come on.

34:19.824 --> 34:20.813
I want you to gnaw on his skull.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.391
- What's the plan?
- Shut up.

34:23.527 --> 34:27.157
Guys, I'm gonna check this dude out.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.400
Yes.

34:31.702 --> 34:32.998
Excuse me.

34:36.373 --> 34:37.431
Yeah.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.380
Just got to kind of stand here
for a second.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.347
All right. Hey, take it easy, man.

34:57.328 --> 34:59.353
He's thin, but sinewy and muscular.

34:59.464 --> 35:02.627
He's got a low center of gravity which
means he's fast like a jack rabbit.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.759
He didn't take a shower today
or yesterday. He's got bad breath.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.997
He's got a couple of cavities
which is not improving...

35:08.106 --> 35:10.131
This is serious. I thought
you were gonna go kick his ass.

35:10.241 --> 35:11.265
Yeah.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.639
Look at Tommy Trigger Finger.
You want the blood and the guts.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.177
Well, it doesn't work that way.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.871
I can't just kick his ass.

35:16.981 --> 35:20.917
Physically, I can,
but if you kick a bully's ass,

35:21.018 --> 35:23.248
then maybe you guys live till lunchtime.

35:23.354 --> 35:24.821
And then what?

35:24.922 --> 35:28.722
"Teach those victims how to kick
the bully's ass and they live forever."

35:28.826 --> 35:30.259
Steven Seagal.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.261
So you're gonna teach us
how to beat him up?

35:32.363 --> 35:35.764
- Like train us?
- So we're gonna beat up Filkins?

35:36.934 --> 35:40.768
What I'm about to show you are
top-secret black ops fighting moves.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.772
And it's all about technique.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.273
I don't care if you're talking about

35:44.375 --> 35:49.438
karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis,

35:49.580 --> 35:52.481
kung pao, Panda Express.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.814
It's all about technique.
I want you to watch my technique.

35:56.187 --> 35:58.815
It's pretty flawless.
Come on, Ryan, charge me.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.720
I'm serious. Try to kill me.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.589
Come on. You ready?
Go! Yeah. Come on.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.389
I got you!

36:06.297 --> 36:08.424
I got you! I got you!

36:12.036 --> 36:13.333
Damn it!

36:13.437 --> 36:18.033
Okay. Tripped right there.
That was the bear hug.

36:18.476 --> 36:21.240
Okay. Wade. Come on!

36:22.180 --> 36:23.579
Here you go! Watch the elbows!

36:23.681 --> 36:25.171
Don't! Stop!

36:25.283 --> 36:28.844
Okay. Last but not least. Charge me.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.651
Everyone, up! Circle me!

36:34.759 --> 36:37.091
Come on.
Let me see some fight from you.

36:37.495 --> 36:38.928
Okay, you guys ready for the blizzard?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.999
- Go get him, boys!
- Yeah. Go, get it, all three of you!

36:42.533 --> 36:46.993
I call truce! Truce! Back up! Three's
too many. Three's too many. Stop.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.974
Wow, one of you
really charley-horsed me.

36:51.075 --> 36:54.602
Okay.
Now it isn't all oriental martial arts.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.374
Sometimes you give
a little Mexican judo as in

36:57.481 --> 36:59.073
"Ju don't know who
you're messing with, homes."

36:59.183 --> 37:03.085
Come on, Ryan, one more. Last one!
Show me your mettle. Come on! <i>Ol√©!</i>

37:04.055 --> 37:05.022
Wow!

37:06.157 --> 37:07.181
Ryan!

37:07.525 --> 37:09.186
Man down!

37:11.062 --> 37:12.029
Ryan!

37:13.965 --> 37:15.398
Was that my fault?

37:16.801 --> 37:19.599
Hey! Check this out.

37:19.704 --> 37:22.104
Dude! You fell like 60 feet.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.502
Jeez, that was crazy.

37:25.743 --> 37:26.801
What is this?

37:26.911 --> 37:28.310
This is a strategic outpost.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.380
I got these posted all over the city.

37:30.481 --> 37:31.812
Don't even look at it, okay?

37:31.916 --> 37:33.850
Now let's get back up there
and get to work.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.784
What's this for?
To wash your balls in the morning?

37:38.656 --> 37:40.817
No. Look like a squeegee to you?

37:40.925 --> 37:43.018
Or does it look like a weapon
with a straight edge

37:43.127 --> 37:45.459
and a little mop to clean up the blood?

37:46.964 --> 37:48.829
T-Dog, Emmit, this way.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.628
- Where's Drillbit?
- I don't know.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.794
- Wait up.
- Should be right up here.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.072
Man down!

38:02.313 --> 38:03.905
Take this.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.380
- Take a swing at my head.
- Oh, no.

38:05.483 --> 38:07.280
Wade, come on. Just hit me.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.148
- But it'll hurt.
- Wade hit me.

38:09.253 --> 38:11.016
- I'll do it.
- Shut up.

38:15.226 --> 38:19.356
I feel no pain,
'cause I have a trained mind.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.430
- Go!
- Come on.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.931
- Let's beat it.
- Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

38:24.969 --> 38:28.200
- Hey, Drillbit. We could make s'mores!
- No.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.139
- How much does a Hug Me Bear cost?
- No.

38:31.742 --> 38:35.234
- Where'd you get the kids, Drillbit?
- I won them in a poker game.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.947
Order up!

38:37.048 --> 38:39.573
- How's this part of the training?
- It's called bulking up.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.278
- I'm already fat.
- Hey. You're not fat.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.015
I don't want to hear you say you're fat.

38:44.121 --> 38:49.616
Words like lard ass, fat pig, butterball,
landslide, mudslide.

38:49.727 --> 38:52.491
I don't want to hear that.
What are you tipping the scales at?

38:52.596 --> 38:54.063
180.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.291
What?

38:57.201 --> 38:58.293
Whenever you're ready, boys.

38:58.402 --> 38:59.562
Okay, one of you guys
got to pick this up,

38:59.670 --> 39:00.659
'cause I'm still on the clock.

39:03.541 --> 39:04.974
Filkins. Filkins.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.442
Avoidance technique!
Avoidance technique!

39:11.048 --> 39:12.515
<i>Come out here, Capone!</i>
<i>You want to fight?</i>

39:12.616 --> 39:14.243
<i>You want to fight,</i>
<i>you and me, right here?</i>

39:14.352 --> 39:16.149
This is very important. See that?

39:16.253 --> 39:17.948
<i>What's the matter? Afraid to</i>
<i>come out from behind your men?</i>

39:18.055 --> 39:19.545
- He has a holdback guy.
<i>- Afraid to stand up for yourself?</i>

39:19.657 --> 39:21.784
Now that allows people to think
that you want to fight

39:21.892 --> 39:23.257
when really he doesn't want to fight.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.192
<i>You got nothing in court.</i>
<i>You don't got the bookkeeper.</i>

39:25.296 --> 39:26.763
When I'm here I'm your holdback guy.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.798
So now you can act crazy.

39:28.966 --> 39:30.661
No, hey, hey, calm down.

39:34.572 --> 39:35.766
I'm gonna kill you!

39:35.873 --> 39:38.398
Hey, stop! Stop!

39:38.509 --> 39:39.874
Calm down.

39:39.977 --> 39:41.103
- Hoo-rah.
- Hoo-rah.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.078
Get under the wing.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.643
Put all the bills facing
the same direction.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.085
Yeah, don't worry about it, Don.

39:51.188 --> 39:53.315
I thought these kids were loaded.

39:53.591 --> 39:56.583
It's like all you read about are how
14-year-olds rule the marketplace,

39:56.694 --> 39:58.025
and look at this.

39:58.129 --> 40:01.530
Hardly got anything. You think this is
gonna get me to the Great White North?

40:01.632 --> 40:03.793
Allow me to make a point real quick.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.160
Hello, delicious.

40:05.269 --> 40:08.636
Drillbit? Do you know
why we come here every day?

40:09.840 --> 40:12.934
It's because these businessmen
can't eat all their food.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.203
They have more than they need.

40:15.312 --> 40:17.974
These kids are a lot like
these businessmen, okay?

40:18.082 --> 40:20.209
They have way more than they need.

40:20.317 --> 40:23.718
It's our job to go into their houses
and take all their excess.

40:23.821 --> 40:25.948
I get a kick out of these kids.

40:26.690 --> 40:29.420
I told you that little fat one
says some funny shit.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.051
I like these kids, too, man.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.222
I mean, from what I gather,
they're some pretty cool dudes.

40:34.331 --> 40:36.925
But if you like them,
you should think about helping them.

40:37.034 --> 40:39.093
- If you care about them.
- What do you mean?

40:39.203 --> 40:40.534
Steal their TV.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.934
Maybe they'll read a book.

40:43.040 --> 40:47.602
Steal their iPod. Heck, I don't know.
Maybe they'll learn to play the piano.

40:48.145 --> 40:49.669
They don't need all this crap.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.407
You think Mozart had a Game Boy?

40:51.515 --> 40:55.349
I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me.
I was outside playing, climbing trees.

40:55.453 --> 40:59.253
Yeah, man, me, too.
I'm still outside hanging around in trees.

41:00.191 --> 41:03.456
And the parents are never around.
There's no one there in the daytime.

41:03.561 --> 41:05.825
One big hit. It's all we need.

41:20.544 --> 41:21.738
Boobies.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.246
Penis!

41:34.592 --> 41:39.757
All right. Open your eyes, let your body
drift back into consciousness.

41:41.098 --> 41:46.968
<i>Namaste.</i> Thank you for your practice.
That concludes the meditation time.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.532
- Okay. How do you feel?
- I feel good.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.302
- Doing all right?
- Yeah. I think my biceps are coming in.

41:52.409 --> 41:53.637
Guns are coming in.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.008
Now, listen.
We're about 10% done with the training.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.102
- Next...
- 10%?

41:57.214 --> 42:00.081
Are you high?
We can't sit in the woods anymore.

42:00.184 --> 42:03.051
- We got to go back to school.
- Yeah, and I can't forge any more notes.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.451
How many diseases can a kid have?

42:12.062 --> 42:14.360
You guys think you're ready?

42:15.900 --> 42:18.391
You know,
I am really scared to go back.

42:18.502 --> 42:21.471
Look. If you're not ready to fight,
there is another alternative.

42:21.572 --> 42:22.630
But I got to be honest with you,

42:22.740 --> 42:26.073
only the strongest of warriors
can pull this one off.

42:27.478 --> 42:32.082
It's so difficult that most men
tremble at its mere thought.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.047
What is it?

42:34.184 --> 42:36.118
What the hell is it?

42:39.189 --> 42:40.417
Love him.

42:40.758 --> 42:42.749
- What?
- Love him.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.090
You know, I don't know
what's going through your head, Drillbit,

42:45.195 --> 42:47.254
but I'm not gonna bang him.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.259
When I'm talking about love,
I mean compassion.

42:49.366 --> 42:52.494
- I'm not going to...
- Shut up. And understanding.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.136
Find your commonality.

42:55.239 --> 42:58.402
Let him know you're more alike
than different.

42:59.276 --> 43:01.335
Maybe that'll put out his fuse.

43:03.213 --> 43:04.441
And remember, guys,

43:04.548 --> 43:07.415
just because you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

43:07.518 --> 43:11.579
I'll be there like a silent,
deadly poltergeist.

43:11.689 --> 43:12.656
- Thanks.
- Okay.

43:12.756 --> 43:13.950
All right, see you later, Drillbit.

43:14.058 --> 43:15.719
Remember, you're under my wing.

43:19.830 --> 43:20.990
Oh, no.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.396
There he is. Should we hide?

43:23.500 --> 43:26.333
No. We've been running
and hiding all week.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.531
This is what Drillbit's been
talking about, finding commonalities.

43:29.640 --> 43:33.508
He's rapping. You love to rap!
You can do this!

43:33.777 --> 43:34.766
No, I can't.

43:34.878 --> 43:36.903
Yes, you can. It's just like in <i>8 Mile.</i>
He'll respect you.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.743
No, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!

43:38.849 --> 43:41.317
- You're crazy! Don't do it.
- You can do it, Ryan.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.113
- I believe in you.
- Don't.

43:43.954 --> 43:47.355
All right. I can do it. I can do it.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.254
- Whassup, whassup?
- Whassup?

43:53.597 --> 43:56.259
I wanna rap with you.
Hey, flip the script, Ronnie.

43:56.367 --> 43:57.595
Hit that beat.

43:57.868 --> 44:00.268
- Yo, this cool, Fil?
- Sure, whatever.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.970
<i>Yo, call me whatever you want</i>

44:04.074 --> 44:06.599
<i>but you know I gets busy I'm so badass</i>

44:06.744 --> 44:09.304
<i>I'm the king of Vice City</i>
<i>Like the Buddha, I'm Zen</i>

44:09.413 --> 44:11.643
<i>Like Beckham, I bend, I tell suckers</i>

44:11.749 --> 44:13.740
<i>"Say hello to my little friend"</i>

44:14.685 --> 44:15.947
Snap! This guy!

44:17.955 --> 44:21.686
<i>Hey, meatball, where's your spaghetti?</i>
<i>Your rapping's like a nightmare</i>

44:21.792 --> 44:23.384
<i>But I don't see Freddy</i>
<i>You best</i>

44:23.494 --> 44:26.224
<i>not even try to spit rhymes, dude</i>
<i>'Cause when you spit</i>

44:26.330 --> 44:28.821
<i>all I ever see is chewed-up food</i>

44:29.333 --> 44:30.925
Yeah, that's how we roll!
That's how we do!

44:31.035 --> 44:32.024
Hold on!

44:32.136 --> 44:33.433
<i>I know you didn't just go there</i>

44:33.537 --> 44:36.563
<i>I got more skills than you</i>
<i>in my one and only nut hair</i>

44:36.840 --> 44:38.171
Nice, man, nice.

44:38.776 --> 44:41.438
<i>So you better step off</i>
<i>before you insult me and mine</i>

44:41.545 --> 44:44.207
<i>'Cause if you decide to step on, see</i>
<i>I'm like a land mine</i>

44:44.314 --> 44:45.611
Boom!

44:48.185 --> 44:50.881
<i>Oh, my God, look</i>
<i>it's a punkass rapping</i>

44:51.055 --> 44:53.489
<i>He say one more word</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to bitch-slap him</i>

44:53.590 --> 44:56.252
<i>So surprised you're moving</i>
<i>ass is so damn fat</i>

44:56.360 --> 44:59.625
<i>You're lucky I don't hit you</i>
<i>with my Wiffle, Wiffle Ball bat</i>

45:00.164 --> 45:03.224
<i>Can't hurt my head with a bat</i>
<i>I'm the Incredible Hulk</i>

45:03.333 --> 45:06.734
<i>I'm like Costco</i>
<i>I'm serving ass kickings in bulk</i>

45:06.837 --> 45:09.499
<i>You don't like my words</i>
<i>Mister King of the School?</i>

45:09.606 --> 45:12.769
<i>Well, guess what?</i>
<i>You can suck on my family's jewels</i>

45:12.910 --> 45:14.241
<i>Bitch!</i>

45:23.020 --> 45:25.079
That was awesome.

45:25.189 --> 45:26.486
What have I just done?

45:26.590 --> 45:28.148
Hey, that was amazing. I mean,

45:28.258 --> 45:29.748
telling him to suck on
your two family jewels

45:29.860 --> 45:31.555
was in questionable taste, but still...

45:31.662 --> 45:33.960
I know, I got caught up
in the moment, okay?

45:34.064 --> 45:36.157
Keep walking.
I don't want to get shot like Tupac.

45:36.266 --> 45:39.201
You know, most of those people
were cheering for you.

45:39.303 --> 45:42.329
Really? That could be good.
Maybe Drillbit was right.

45:46.443 --> 45:48.104
Think you're so funny?

45:48.212 --> 45:51.238
Good. 'Cause you're not gonna laugh
when you're dead.

45:51.348 --> 45:54.579
You're gonna get it now,
worse than ever.

45:54.818 --> 45:55.910
All of you.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.245
Ryan, holdback technique.

45:59.857 --> 46:01.984
You don't like the fact that
he's better than you, Filkins!

46:02.092 --> 46:04.583
You better back the hell off before I...

46:08.465 --> 46:13.596
- Thanks for holding him for me.
- Holy crap, you guys are retarded!

46:17.274 --> 46:19.208
How did he do so much damage
with one punch?

46:19.309 --> 46:21.539
It's like his fist is the size
of your whole face.

46:21.645 --> 46:23.476
I guess it's true.

46:23.580 --> 46:24.808
Rap really does promote violence.

46:24.915 --> 46:27.383
Yeah, but the question is, where was
Drillbit when we needed him?

46:27.484 --> 46:29.076
Maybe he got called to the black ops.

46:29.186 --> 46:30.949
Wade, come on.
You really believe that garbage?

46:31.054 --> 46:33.113
There's my little soldiers.

46:34.725 --> 46:36.659
There are my pooper troopers.

46:36.760 --> 46:40.696
Hey, sorry I missed that walkie-talkie
call. I had something come...

46:42.399 --> 46:45.562
- What the hell happened to you?
- Filkins punched me.

46:46.436 --> 46:48.666
- Filkins did that to you?
- Yeah.

46:48.772 --> 46:49.932
Where were you?

46:50.040 --> 46:52.235
- With one punch?
- Where were you?

46:53.143 --> 46:56.340
- Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
- Stop.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.675
- No, just let me get the blood off.
- No. Stop.

46:58.782 --> 47:00.909
Man. Here, sit down for a second.

47:01.018 --> 47:03.748
- Crap. It looks painful.
- Yeah, it is.

47:04.221 --> 47:05.916
- Here, let me put a little pressure on it.
- No.

47:06.023 --> 47:07.615
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

47:07.724 --> 47:09.419
Ryan had a rap off with Filkins.

47:09.526 --> 47:12.256
- You had a rap off?
- You said to find common ground.

47:12.362 --> 47:15.525
He said he was like Costco,
serving up ass kickings in bulk.

47:15.632 --> 47:17.725
That's what you said?
That's not common ground.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.564
Even though it's funny.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.865
That's not exactly what I meant
when I said common ground.

47:21.972 --> 47:24.770
Why didn't you get punched?
Why'd he slug you?

47:24.875 --> 47:26.866
'Cause of your brilliant
holdback technique.

47:26.977 --> 47:29.741
The holdback technique?
You really tried that?

47:29.847 --> 47:33.442
Yeah. Bottom line is
your advice backfired.

47:33.550 --> 47:35.142
Now we're more screwed than ever.

47:35.252 --> 47:37.413
All because you wanted to protect
the hobbit over here.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.045
- Hey, let's just stop for a second.
- I am not a hobbit.

47:39.156 --> 47:40.953
- You're a damn hobbit, okay?
- I am not!

47:41.058 --> 47:44.687
Hold it! Hey.
Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.286
Problem isn't the holdback technique,

47:47.397 --> 47:50.525
although I don't think you guys
had it perfected enough to try.

47:50.634 --> 47:52.226
The problem is Randy
starts rapping insults.

47:52.336 --> 47:55.237
It's not Randy! Okay? It's Ryan!

47:55.339 --> 47:59.673
And all this talk about you being there
when you're not there, it's bull! Okay?

48:00.177 --> 48:02.042
I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!

48:02.145 --> 48:06.343
Hey! Sit down here.
Sit down here for a second.

48:06.450 --> 48:11.080
All of you, sit down. You take the bass
out of your voice when you talk to me.

48:11.755 --> 48:13.723
Now, we just completed phase one.

48:13.824 --> 48:16.486
See if this guy has any mettle.
And guess what we found out?

48:16.593 --> 48:20.188
Filkins does have some mettle.
So now we move to phase two.

48:20.297 --> 48:23.733
Know what phase two is?
Direct contact.

48:23.901 --> 48:27.496
That's where I come in.
Because I will not let this happen again,

48:27.604 --> 48:29.504
if I can help it.

48:29.606 --> 48:31.301
So what's the plan?

48:31.408 --> 48:32.875
- The plan?
- Yeah.

48:36.613 --> 48:38.638
How early do you guys
have to get up for school?

48:38.749 --> 48:39.738
- 7:00.
- 7:00.

48:39.850 --> 48:44.253
Oh, God. Okay.
Tomorrow, we all go in together.

48:51.461 --> 48:54.453
Hey, Wade, what's up?

48:55.666 --> 48:57.031
Where'd you get the shiner?

48:57.134 --> 48:59.261
Come in here, boy. Talk to me.

49:02.472 --> 49:04.940
I was protecting this one kid
in my school

49:05.042 --> 49:07.943
from a bunch of bullies
and one of them punched me.

49:08.045 --> 49:11.173
What? Why would you protect
the kid from a bully?

49:11.415 --> 49:14.316
So he doesn't get beat up.

49:14.685 --> 49:17.279
Then you're interfering
with the natural order.

49:18.655 --> 49:20.646
When I was a kid, I was kind of a bully.

49:20.757 --> 49:23.920
But it's not a bad thing. There was
this kid. I don't know what it was.

49:24.027 --> 49:27.986
Maybe it was his stupid face.
But he'd just really get under my skin.

49:28.098 --> 49:31.067
So I pushed him around a little bit,
called him some hurtful names,

49:31.168 --> 49:34.535
and I honestly think, if I met him today,
he'd thank me for it.

49:34.638 --> 49:37.471
I prepared him for the harshness
of the real world.

49:38.742 --> 49:40.039
Thanks, Jim.

49:40.143 --> 49:43.408
I'm a resource, Wade.
You should use me more often.

49:46.383 --> 49:47.816
Is it locked?

49:48.418 --> 49:50.147
- You got lunch money?
- Yep.

49:50.420 --> 49:52.581
- You got any tests today?
- See you and the questions.

49:52.689 --> 49:55.419
Don't fresh-off to any of your teachers.

49:55.892 --> 49:58.452
All right, come here,
give mommy a kiss.

49:58.562 --> 50:00.792
Come on, punky-wunky. I love you.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.192
- Okay.
- Be good.

50:09.339 --> 50:12.103
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye. I love you, Mommy!

50:12.209 --> 50:13.972
"I love you, Mommy."

50:15.912 --> 50:17.573
Black ops in the hizzouse.

50:17.681 --> 50:20.081
This old soldier could use
a kissy from mommy.

50:20.183 --> 50:21.844
Come on.
I'm going in to the school today.

50:21.952 --> 50:24.011
Drillbit is going in. Very visible.
Let's do it.

50:24.121 --> 50:26.248
- You can't go in there looking like that.
- Why?

50:26.356 --> 50:28.256
You look like Crocodile Dundee
or something.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.053
Screw you. What're you talking about?

50:30.160 --> 50:31.491
I'm just saying we need to clean you up.

50:31.595 --> 50:34.428
Wrong. This soldier doesn't clean up.
What you see is what you get.

50:34.531 --> 50:36.328
Drillbit, you just don't look
like a teacher.

50:36.433 --> 50:38.731
I mean, we need you to blend in.
The camouflage technique.

50:38.835 --> 50:41.065
- In my house. Come on.
- Let's go.

50:41.204 --> 50:43.764
"Camouflage technique"? I like that.

50:43.974 --> 50:49.105
...if I remember how to do this.
It really is strong enough for a man.

50:59.456 --> 51:02.118
Did your dad leave any socks behind?

51:03.126 --> 51:06.562
How many tardies can you have
before they give you a detention?

51:08.532 --> 51:10.734
Emmit, you're drying my eyeballs.

51:14.104 --> 51:18.006
All right, here's our class schedules
and a detailed map of the school.

51:18.108 --> 51:21.077
We have the first class together,
so just meet us by the Life Skills room

51:21.178 --> 51:22.270
so you can walk us to our lockers.

51:22.379 --> 51:24.142
Okay, now, remember,
I'm not just gonna walk in there

51:24.247 --> 51:26.511
and start kicking ass, okay?
I got to protect you guys,

51:26.616 --> 51:29.050
but I need to blend in and lay low.

51:29.152 --> 51:33.612
I'm gonna be visible to you guys,
but invisible to everyone else.

51:40.831 --> 51:45.200
That's a look that says,
"I have no idea what I'm doing here."

51:47.437 --> 51:50.531
All first-time subs have it.
Welcome to McKinley!

51:52.209 --> 51:55.610
- Thanks. Was it that obvious?
- Well, yeah, a little bit.

51:56.746 --> 51:57.872
Whoa!

51:58.181 --> 52:01.617
Not you kids. Please, go to class.
Go, go, go. Get away from me.

52:02.452 --> 52:05.285
You, second floor, teachers' lounge.

52:05.388 --> 52:07.379
They'll give you your assignment
up there. It's right over there.

52:07.491 --> 52:10.153
- I'm gonna head up there. Okay.
- Yep? You got it.

52:19.035 --> 52:20.525
How're you doing?

52:22.472 --> 52:25.805
Teachers' lounge. They're all the same.

52:28.278 --> 52:31.042
Put your names on the food. Smart.

52:31.748 --> 52:32.772
Sneaky.

52:34.384 --> 52:36.944
- See <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> last night?
- Yeah.

52:38.488 --> 52:39.716
- Hey, Lis.
- Hi.

52:39.823 --> 52:41.688
Got half an orange with your name on it.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.258
Oh, no, thanks.

52:58.275 --> 53:01.369
- Can I help you?
- No. With what?

53:02.078 --> 53:04.706
- Are you lost?
- No. Why?

53:05.248 --> 53:08.775
- You look like a lost parent.
- No.

53:08.919 --> 53:11.820
No. I'm a substitute.

53:13.790 --> 53:17.988
- For what?
- For whatever needs substituting.

53:19.696 --> 53:23.792
Yeah, they'll just plug me in.
I think I'm just gonna wait here until,

53:23.900 --> 53:26.994
you know, if they need me in
French, then that's where I'll go.

53:27.103 --> 53:29.799
- You know French?
- A little bit. Yeah.

53:29.906 --> 53:33.569
Enough to get by,
or enough to teach these animals.

53:35.612 --> 53:37.807
- What do you teach?
- English.

53:38.615 --> 53:39.946
My native tongue.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.278
I'm Lisa Zachey.

53:47.090 --> 53:49.581
Now is that Miss or Missus Zachey?

53:49.693 --> 53:55.063
- Miss.
- Miss. It had to be. <i>Enchant√©.</i>

53:57.133 --> 53:59.067
And who are you?

53:59.269 --> 54:01.760
Drill... Dr. Illbit.

54:02.706 --> 54:03.673
Oh.

54:03.773 --> 54:05.001
- Yeah.
- A doctor.

54:05.108 --> 54:08.805
Teacher. Teacher and a doctor.
Just want to help.

54:08.912 --> 54:12.939
People don't care how I do it.
Just give me a chance to help.

54:13.250 --> 54:17.084
- You want some hot coffee?
- Only in the worst way.

54:19.623 --> 54:22.148
Who can give me
another name for gonorrhea?

54:25.161 --> 54:26.560
That's a little hint.

54:26.663 --> 54:31.066
That's right, the clap. Or the drip.

54:31.501 --> 54:33.469
All right, Dane? Get the lights.

54:33.570 --> 54:38.564
<i>In the male, the bacteria of gonorrhea</i>
<i>usually enters by way of the urethra.</i>

54:38.675 --> 54:41.701
<i>From two to five days later,</i>
<i>the guy feels a painful burning,</i>

54:41.811 --> 54:43.540
<i>particularly when he urinates...</i>

54:43.647 --> 54:45.945
They make these things to scare us.
I'm not scared of this.

54:46.049 --> 54:49.018
<i>... looks like this.</i>

54:49.252 --> 54:53.586
- I really like your suit.
- Yeah. I really like your everything.

54:53.690 --> 54:55.214
Now what do we do?

54:55.325 --> 54:57.816
Not many teachers
can afford a suit like that.

54:57.927 --> 54:59.861
- Yeah?
- If he wants to eat.

55:01.031 --> 55:03.261
Well, I mainly eat out of a dumpster.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.460
I should try that.
I need some new dresses.

55:07.570 --> 55:11.529
Don't. Or if you do, stay away from
the one at Ocean and Wilshire.

55:11.641 --> 55:15.407
That's mine. Seriously, stay out of it.

55:16.746 --> 55:19.715
- What are we doing? Let's go.
- I don't know.

55:19.816 --> 55:21.681
You're a bad boy.

55:22.018 --> 55:25.510
- Maybe I need a detention.
- You're funny.

55:26.690 --> 55:29.454
- I'm not joking.
- Me, either.

55:36.232 --> 55:38.598
Look, I want nothing more
than to spend the rest of the day

55:38.702 --> 55:40.966
sitting on this couch with you,

55:41.071 --> 55:44.768
but I got to get to class because
my students need me. Okay?

55:44.908 --> 55:48.639
No. You still have five minutes
before the next class.

55:48.978 --> 55:49.967
We do?

55:50.080 --> 55:54.278
And you seem like someone who could
accomplish a lot in five minutes.

55:54.651 --> 55:56.448
I hope so.

55:56.553 --> 55:59.647
Although five minutes
might be four too many.

56:03.226 --> 56:04.921
Let's go, let's go!

56:05.028 --> 56:07.622
We really like Life Skills.
Can we just stay in the room, maybe?

56:07.731 --> 56:09.892
Why don't you practice
some life skills out here in the hallway?

56:09.999 --> 56:11.591
It's just as important.

56:12.535 --> 56:13.524
Okay, where is he?

56:13.636 --> 56:16.469
This is bull. Maybe I should
just beat the crap out of you two.

56:16.573 --> 56:18.438
There's Brooke!

56:23.480 --> 56:24.947
Oh, no. There he is.

56:31.654 --> 56:32.848
I think I'd better get...

56:32.956 --> 56:34.446
When are you free? I want to see you.

56:34.557 --> 56:36.718
- I have sixth period free.
- Sixth period? Okay.

56:36.826 --> 56:38.487
I think I have that period free, also.

56:38.595 --> 56:40.426
Why don't we meet back here? Okay?

56:40.530 --> 56:42.020
- Okay.
- Meet me right here?

56:42.132 --> 56:43.622
I'll keep the couch warm.

56:43.733 --> 56:46.702
We better check the tags to make sure
this couch is flame retardant.

56:46.803 --> 56:48.100
- I will.
- You know?

56:48.271 --> 56:50.068
You know what I mean?
Flame retardant?

56:50.173 --> 56:51.731
- Yes.
- 'Cause you're hot.

56:53.309 --> 56:55.869
Where is Life Skills?

56:58.348 --> 57:00.578
Drillbit, come in, please!
Where are you?

57:00.683 --> 57:01.672
<i>Drillbit, come in!</i>

57:01.785 --> 57:04.310
I don't know!
I can't understand Emmit's map!

57:04.821 --> 57:07.881
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, Emmit. Come on.

57:08.324 --> 57:11.384
- Crap!
- I knew Drillbit was a fraud.

57:11.494 --> 57:13.587
- I told you!
- He's gonna be here!

57:13.696 --> 57:14.890
Life Skills!

57:15.064 --> 57:17.658
I need Life Skills!

57:18.234 --> 57:19.633
Out of my way!

57:27.143 --> 57:29.703
Open the door!

57:29.846 --> 57:31.177
How is that up to code?

57:31.281 --> 57:33.613
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

57:36.653 --> 57:39.315
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

57:51.267 --> 57:53.326
This is real! This is not a drill.

57:53.436 --> 57:55.301
Everybody, clear the hall!

57:55.405 --> 57:58.169
That means you! Let's go!
Clear the hall!

58:00.677 --> 58:02.941
The freak actually came through, huh?

58:04.247 --> 58:05.441
Awesome!

58:12.856 --> 58:14.619
- Hoo-rah.
- Hoo-rah.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.157
All right.

58:27.070 --> 58:29.095
Mister Filkins!
Why don't you just come up

58:29.205 --> 58:31.969
to the front of the class and read from

58:32.075 --> 58:34.566
<i>The Collected Works</i>
<i>of the Romantic Poets?</i>

58:39.415 --> 58:41.781
"I like kissing this and that of you

58:41.885 --> 58:46.879
"I like slowly stroking the shocking fuzz"

58:51.027 --> 58:54.463
Hey, aren't you the guy that
kicked Filkins' butt freestyling?

58:55.298 --> 58:57.823
You better believe it.
They call me T-Dog.

58:57.967 --> 59:01.562
- Wow, that's cool.
- He is so cute!

59:01.671 --> 59:02.638
Wow.

59:02.739 --> 59:05.003
<i>Wade, this is Drillbit. Come in. Wade?</i>

59:05.608 --> 59:08.304
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Filkins is heading east down the stairs.

59:08.411 --> 59:10.971
The first stairwell. He's coming
down now. Watch your ass.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.604
Read you. Copy. Roger.

59:12.715 --> 59:15.616
F.Y.I., I just heard this pack of girls
yapping, and your girl, Brooke,

59:15.718 --> 59:19.484
just got cast in <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>
You might want to check that out.

59:19.956 --> 59:23.983
Madam, madam, your lady mother
is coming to your chamber!

59:24.961 --> 59:27.623
The day is broke, be wary, look about.

59:30.867 --> 59:34.200
Come on! You're dogging it!
Faster! Faster!

59:34.304 --> 59:36.264
Go! I want to see some more!

59:36.372 --> 59:41.571
Go! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! One more!

59:41.711 --> 59:43.576
And you guys!
I don't want you just watching!

59:43.680 --> 59:46.240
Do some bass fishing! Then reel it in!

59:46.349 --> 59:47.407
Come on!

59:47.517 --> 59:50.042
Let's go, keep going!
Work some thumbs!

59:50.153 --> 59:51.814
For texting!

59:53.556 --> 59:54.784
Look out, huh?

59:55.158 --> 59:59.060
- How was school, Professor?
- It is great.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:03.430
And as long as you got a coffee cup
in your hand, nobody says anything.

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.932
I was thinking
about writing a paper on...

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.527
- Hey!
- What the...

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:10.663
Coffee cup.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:13.503
Now, Castro,
he knew that he was not gonna get

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.407
any action with Marilyn Monroe.

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.911
And that is why John F. Kennedy
was shot.

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:25.617
- Don!
- Hello, fellow teacher.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.554
Come on, guys, hit the showers!

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:39.124
Look, my rope's too short.
I can't get down.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:42.204
Where you going? Get back here!

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:45.507
- Yo, hold on!
- What is this?

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:47.838
Ronnie, let yourself down.

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:03.923
<i>Happy birthday, Dr. Illbit</i>

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:09.124
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:01.749
Hey, T-Dog. You've got to admit
hiring Drillbit was a good idea.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.546
- Okay, you're right.
- See?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.087
The freak's actually worth all the money
we're spending on him, I guess.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.680
Good morning.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:12.516
- Great coffee this morning, Dr. Illbit.
- Enjoy it.

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.428
- You know, I really like it here.
- You're doing a great job, Drillbit.

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:16.657
I know I am.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.730
Come here, come here, come here.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.361
Okay, quick. Pop quiz. You like a girl.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.132
You're completely shocked
that she likes you.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:26.265
Things are already just crazy hot,
just <i>loco.</i>

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.400
But now you'd like to ask her out.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:31.674
And you're not sure if
she's just in it for the sex.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.942
And you haven't been
on a date in forever.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.574
And you're a little bit afraid,

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.482
and you don't know
what the hell you're doing, anyway.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.111
Well, I can't really relate to that,

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.747
but what I would do is just
join every club she's in

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.418
and eventually work up
the nerve to talk to her.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.995
- And how's that working for you?
- Not at all.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.564
Okay, look. One should do the opposite.

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.292
- Yeah, probably.
- Okay.

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:55.670
Congratulations, you just passed.
Hey, scram. Scram. Crotch blocker.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.001
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.634
- Look, you look pretty.
- Thank you.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.739
You know,
I haven't been on a lot of dates,

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:07.543
and I really don't know the way
this is supposed to work,

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.140
because we kind of skipped that part.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:13.621
But would you ever want to get together
after school and maybe hang out?

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.655
I'm sorry.

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:21.621
Rule 35A in the teacher's manual states
that you cannot date other teachers.

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:27.062
Oh, really. Yeah.
Probably a good policy.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.528
Yeah.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:31.432
So it's a good thing you're a doctor.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.634
So, yes.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.712
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:44.947
The Battle of Sekigahara

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:49.881
when Kanetsugu mocked
Tokunaga's abuses,

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:53.590
which only infuriated Tokunaga

01:03:54.363 --> 01:04:00.962
who then summoned Toyotomi
and united Japan.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.938
And kept the local feudal lords
from warring.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.873
Hey. What are you doing in this club?

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.409
I'm Asian.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.001
He died. Then...

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.512
- No, you aren't.
- Yeah. A little bit.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.149
Really?

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:18.911
- You don't even look a little Asian.
- Yeah, I know.

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.756
The West attacked first.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:26.153
So how come I see you in, like,
so many activities I'm in?

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:31.196
Just... I joined some of the clubs
you were in because

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.200
I wanted to have a chance to talk to you.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:38.604
Wakisaka, 990 men.
Ankokuji, 1,800 men.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:42.109
So you're not Asian.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:43.178
No.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:47.681
Well, maybe somewhere way back.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:52.785
Chosokabe, 6,600 men.
This is exciting, don't you think?

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.287
All these men.

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.391
Well, you can't quit now.

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:58.551
I'm gonna make you come
to all our meetings.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.754
Membership is way down this year.

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:02.558
Okay. I can do that.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:07.660
- Is everything okay at school?
- Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm busy.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:11.831
Honey, I know there's a lot of pressure
on kids once they get to high school.

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.568
And there are kids who are gonna
want to be your friend,

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:16.270
but they'll also want you
to take their drugs.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:19.413
I just noticed that you seem
to be out of money a lot lately,

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.847
and I want to make sure
you're not spending your money on that.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.579
No! I'm not doing drugs, Mom.
I promise.

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:26.882
Coach says drugs are for losers.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.119
You sure you're not high?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.927
No!

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.825
Well, I notice you're really going
at your food.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.195
- Got the munchies?
- Anyways, we just worry about you.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.792
I understand that.

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:42.359
Also, I'm missing a silver platter
that was in the living room.

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.336
- Have you seen it?
- I'm taking Home Ec.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.635
We needed serving trays
for appetizers. Sorry.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.369
Yeah, well, come to think of it,
I'm missing a watch.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:50.308
You didn't take that to Home Ec, too,
did you?

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.472
Oh, yeah.
We're making watch cupcakes, Jim.

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.276
Watch it, wise guy.

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:01.412
Hey.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:05.661
Careful, Wade. You don't sneak up
on somebody like that.

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:06.989
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.996
But I could have jumped up
and killed you in two moves,

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.760
and then, I don't know, I'd feel guilty.

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:14.495
- I talked to Brooke.
- Really? Have a seat.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.628
- I think she might like me.
- Yeah?

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.570
Yeah. At least a little bit.

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.608
That's all you need.
Get your foot in the door.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.178
I don't think I would have had
the confidence to have tried without you.

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.610
- I mean...
- Come on.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:26.944
It's been great having someone
around who, like, likes me

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:29.176
and isn't making fun of me
or telling me to join the football team

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.752
like my stepdad.

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:33.879
Just do your best. Be all you can be.
What's the Army always say?

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.617
"Have it your way."

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.591
I think that's Burger King.

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:43.728
Where do you think they got it from?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:47.360
Plus, what you did.
The whole black ops bodyguard thing.

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:50.469
Well, yeah.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:54.803
Yeah. I actually wanted to be a doctor.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.570
Yeah.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.683
But my old man was an Army colonel,
wouldn't pay for me to go to college.

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:08.715
Yeah. He always said, "Drillbit, you're
not the doctor type. You're stupid."

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:12.791
I guess he thought that
because I didn't get good grades

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.863
or like to go to school.

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.265
I don't know. Maybe he was right.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.338
So you became an army of one.

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:26.063
An army of one.

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:28.601
Here.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.308
We made this for you.

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:33.779
An army of four.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.486
I don't know if you understand,

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:42.683
but before we met you, we thought
our lives were gonna suck forever.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.282
At least I did.

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:51.561
Well, you're right. I don't understand
because of how hardened I am.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.863
Tough thing about what I do
is I can't let my guard down.

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:00.173
Well, for what it's worth,

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:03.803
I hope after all this is done,
you'll still be my friend.

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:04.913
Bye.

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.816
This is so beautiful.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.086
I love coming out here.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:22.688
Actually, I used to live in a small place
near here until it got re-zoned.

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.523
Yeah.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.725
- That's a shame.
- Nah. Probably just as well.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.564
Hey, stranger.

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:32.096
Can you spare some change, stranger?

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:33.773
Here you go.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.136
- Sucker.
- Yeah.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.845
Got some money for some food? Hi.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.048
No time to be cheap.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:48.856
- Wow.
- Good evening, sir. Can I get a dollar?

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.591
- Cool. Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:54.720
Hey, can I get another dollar?

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:00.560
You look familiar.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.100
You know that you're a better person
than me,

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:08.643
because, I hate to say it,
but I just get irritated.

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:12.475
They irritate the shit out of me.
I felt like...

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:16.711
But then you have to think,
they work for the grace of God, so...

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.084
- That's cute.
- Hey, you want to see something cool?

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.486
Come here.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.484
- There.
- Thank you.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.261
So what else do you have in here?

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:30.654
- Two-buck Chuck.
- You know that wine?

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:32.495
I love this wine.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.365
- That's all a teacher can afford.
- Tell me about it.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.933
Get this.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.071
And here I was all worried that
you were gonna take me

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.667
to some hip dance club or something.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.078
That's definitely not me.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.446
But, no, I'm actually more of

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.179
a kind of simple,
just down to earth outdoorsman.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.785
I like that you don't try too hard.

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:57.914
The truth is,
this is me trying really, really hard.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.825
That's cute.

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:05.392
Look, I want to talk to you. I mean...

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:12.032
There's some things
I want you to know about me.

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:15.838
I want us to look each other in the eye,
and I want us to get it out on the table,

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:19.039
and we just, you know,
we listen, and there's no judgment.

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:24.518
God. You're just so great. You're really
just like the perfect guy for me.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.319
- Really?
- I'm serious.

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:31.757
You're just beautiful,
and you're nice to me, and it's so great.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:36.421
'Cause I'm really just always attracted
to just such dirtbag guys.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:37.623
They're out there.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:41.362
I'm a real loser magnet.
It's, like, on some unconscious level,

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:46.601
I just need to be with a guy who has
absolutely nothing going for him.

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:50.668
You know, just some loser,
some bum lying pig.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.110
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- You know, just...

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:53.203
Stop it.

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:57.217
I get it. You made some bad choices,
and who hasn't?

01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:00.285
It's just you were starting
to rant a little bit.

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:01.913
It's just I'm happy to be
with somebody...

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:02.991
I know.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.925
You're with a doctor now.

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:09.130
Yeah. Thank God.

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.594
Let's just kiss.

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.873
Did you do that?

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.944
Kid just jumped out of the bushes
and started jamming. That's weird.

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.781
I got nothing to do with it.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.805
- That naked guy's my teacher!
- What?

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.474
- Yeah!
- He ain't your teacher!

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:05.815
Every day he's at the off-ramp.
I give him some change.

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.752
What do you mean? Like a bum?

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:11.553
What are you talking about?
He's not a bum! Less fortunate!

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.686
Yeah, or get out of the way.

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:15.957
How're you doing?

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:17.692
- Hey, how's it going, Drillbit?
- Hey, Drillbit.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.461
So, listen,
you know the thing we talked about?

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:20.728
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.063
- Plan's off.
- What?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.935
- Drillbit! Drillbit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.502
What do you mean the plan's off?

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:29.338
It's not off. I just mean let's...
Let's postpone it.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:31.037
'Cause I don't think we need
to get their belongings now.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.171
These kids,
they kind of look at me like I'm a hero,

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.840
and, I don't know,
let's run with that for a little bit.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.144
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:38.445
You're really getting into this whole
teacher thing here, huh?

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.385
With the sweaters and the loafers.

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.356
- They're wingtips.
- You look like you teach Fagonometry.

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.518
What the hell is this? Who are you?

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:49.393
I got an old saying for you, Drillbit,
"You can't polish a turd."

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:51.659
Hey, Don, first of all,
that's not an old saying.

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:52.825
You stole that from me.

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:55.403
I say it all the time.
Secondly, I'm insulted.

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.064
Well, you should be. Drillbit, I know you.

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.570
And the real you
would do this deal, man.

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:04.407
There's a lot of heads that want to feed
off of this, man. Don't let us down.

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.003
No! No, that's just it.

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:08.140
For the first time,
I'm not letting everybody down.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.878
- And now you're not making any sense!
- Yeah.

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:15.082
That guy's a fraud!
He's a bum in a Mister Rogers sweater!

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:21.025
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Okay, check it out, check it out.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.222
I just saw the new substitute...

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:24.299
Delta-four-niner,
this is Yu-Gi-Oh-seven.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.095
On the highway to the danger zone.

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.862
<i>Repeat, on the highway, over.</i>

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.835
Oh, shitballs!

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:32.133
Yu-Gi-Oh-four-seven,
you are not clear to cross.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.334
Repeat, you got a bogie northbound.

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:35.842
- Oh, crap.
- Guys, hold your position.

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:36.967
I'm en route.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.740
Guys, hold your position!

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:42.210
Come here, you little rat turds!

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.875
No! Come on!

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:45.351
Yo, so what'd you do, huh?

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.786
What, did you give the substitute
teacher some spare change

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.881
- so he'd give us a hard time?
- Get them!

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.254
Mister Filkins?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.952
Excuse me. I need you to get to class.

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:55.359
And you three,
I want you out of here, too!

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.795
- Go on!
- Hey.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.900
Get out of my face, you bum!

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:01.663
Maybe I will
if you stop hassling these kids.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.169
But until you're ready to do that,

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.502
I'm gonna give you
some detentions to think about it.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.700
Please, just don't,
don't give me detention.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:10.677
Yeah. That's my power,
and I will exercise it.

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.940
And then what? Huh? You gonna make
us shower on the beach

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.515
with you and the rest of the bums?

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.811
- Yeah, we're on to you, buddy.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:20.753
What a freak. You got some
weird little fantasies there, kid.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:23.620
Okay, here's the deal.
Let me make it real simple.

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.590
I'm a faculty...

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.525
Punk-ass!

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:31.957
- He got me right in the ear!
- Run! Run!

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.729
- Yeah! Run! Save yourself!
- Run!

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.837
Medic!

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:38.395
Medic!

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.742
I got hit right in the nose!

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.935
Followed up by a shot to the ear!

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:46.145
Oh, man. Okay.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.149
Oh, that doesn't work at all.

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.490
- This whole time he's a bum!
- Hey! Hey, you guys, hold it! Wait up!

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:58.458
- Guys, let me explain!
- Explain what, huh?

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.756
Filkins is just gonna come after us
harder than ever!

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:02.922
What was that about showering
on the beach?

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:03.998
You guys, hold it.

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:05.157
Why would you shower on the beach?

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:06.256
Why don't we all just shower
on the beach?

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:07.460
It's part of my morning fitness regimen!

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.594
I jog on the beach five miles,
then I swim ten miles.

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:11.969
That's what I do to stay in shape.
Then I shower.

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.735
So, why didn't you defend yourself?

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:16.276
'Cause I got sucker punched!
Look at this!

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.613
Then I got hit in the ear,

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:23.048
which you probably can't even see,
'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.118
I didn't really get hurt,

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:27.279
but I just kind of went down
to give you guys a chance to get away.

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:28.913
We paid you to beat him up!

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.152
How am I gonna beat him up
with all these kids around?

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.230
Okay, then the principal comes
and maybe some cops.

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.389
They'll find out I'm not a real teacher.

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.933
What good am I
if I'm sitting there in jail?

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.799
Look, I took a bullet for you guys today.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.666
You guys got off scot-free!

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.502
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.337
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:51.608
I'm like one of those guys
jumping in front of the President.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.477
And, look, I'm not expecting a thank you.
That's my job.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.244
But maybe give me a bonus
or something.

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:59.320
Sly used to throw in a car
every now and then.

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:03.889
I'm so sorry, Drillbit.

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:09.353
What am I gonna do with you guys?

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.495
You want some cereal?

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:15.195
- You got any Cap'n Crunch?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.494
Let's go.

01:16:20.574 --> 01:16:21.632
- Drillbit!
- What are you doing?

01:16:21.742 --> 01:16:23.175
- What the hell?
- No, don't, stop. Come on.

01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:24.767
- Put that stuff down!
- Hey, no way, man!

01:16:24.878 --> 01:16:26.368
- Drillbit, why you yelling?
- Drillbit, back off, man!

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.914
- You know these guys?
- No, I don't know these people!

01:16:29.016 --> 01:16:30.176
We're almost done here, all right?

01:16:30.284 --> 01:16:32.479
- I am freaking out!
- My parents are gonna kill me!

01:16:32.586 --> 01:16:33.985
- What the hell's going on?
- Everything's fine!

01:16:34.088 --> 01:16:35.316
- Screw this, man! I'm out of here!
- Wait a second!

01:16:35.422 --> 01:16:36.514
- Why are you all yelling?
- Don?

01:16:36.624 --> 01:16:38.854
- Not like this! What are you doing?
- Take it easy!

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:41.052
- Just take it easy, man.
- This isn't the plan.

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:43.186
- Relax.
- All the shit's gone in your house.

01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:44.559
You came to me as a man,
I came to you as a man.

01:16:44.665 --> 01:16:46.155
All the shit is gone in my house!

01:16:46.266 --> 01:16:47.699
- Are you...
- Don't you touch me!

01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:49.860
Don't make me Billy Jack your ass.

01:16:51.839 --> 01:16:52.897
Watch out!

01:17:03.517 --> 01:17:05.678
That's how you Billy Jack
somebody's ass.

01:17:05.786 --> 01:17:06.912
Come on, Bernie, let's go!

01:17:07.021 --> 01:17:08.852
Let's go!
Go on, get out of the way, man!

01:17:08.956 --> 01:17:10.548
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:17:10.658 --> 01:17:12.956
You'd better run! I saw your faces!

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.426
I got a photogenic memory!

01:17:15.596 --> 01:17:17.826
Get out of my house, you asshole!

01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:20.627
What? There's another one?
I'll kill the asshole!

01:17:20.734 --> 01:17:23.794
No! You, asshole! Get out of my house,
now! Look at what you've done!

01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:25.633
I didn't do anything!

01:17:25.806 --> 01:17:27.774
I'm trying to help you guys! Look at me!

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:29.706
Wade, I think one of them peed
in your kitchen.

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.903
- Great!
- Should I call the police?

01:17:32.046 --> 01:17:34.139
No, don't call the police! Just stop.

01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:36.113
Drillbit, just tell us the truth.

01:17:36.216 --> 01:17:39.549
You can't handle the truth! I can't...
What do you want to hear?

01:17:39.653 --> 01:17:41.621
That I was raised in an orphanage?

01:17:41.722 --> 01:17:44.520
That I... That no one wanted me?
You don't want to hear that!

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:46.593
'Cause that's a lie, too!

01:17:48.996 --> 01:17:52.363
Fine. Maybe I wasn't completely straight
with you guys about who I am.

01:17:52.466 --> 01:17:54.457
So you lied about being in the military?

01:17:54.568 --> 01:17:58.004
No! That's true. I was trained
by the United States Army.

01:17:58.105 --> 01:18:00.972
Then why could a teenager beat you up
with so little effort?

01:18:01.075 --> 01:18:04.602
Because I don't like violence.
I wasn't cut out to be a soldier.

01:18:04.912 --> 01:18:07.380
- Boo-hoo.
- I like the parts with the repelling

01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:10.917
and the crawling through the mud
and the swinging on the monkey bars

01:18:11.018 --> 01:18:14.613
and the helping the wounded,
but I don't like confrontation.

01:18:14.722 --> 01:18:18.249
Even this, with you three ganging up
on me, is not... I don't...

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:20.919
- It's really... I'm sorry.
- Shit!

01:18:21.195 --> 01:18:24.631
You were in the military, huh?
Tell me where you served.

01:18:24.832 --> 01:18:28.996
My company was in the Middle East,
and I was there for like half a day.

01:18:29.103 --> 01:18:33.836
I saw some camels and heard some,

01:18:34.475 --> 01:18:37.342
I think, were some explosions,
I don't know.

01:18:37.845 --> 01:18:41.941
And it was...
It was so hot over there. It was...

01:18:42.816 --> 01:18:46.149
I just climbed in the wheel well of a
cargo plane, and I flew back to the U.S.

01:18:46.253 --> 01:18:48.653
I went AWOL. It was...

01:18:48.756 --> 01:18:50.849
Is your name even Drillbit?

01:18:51.191 --> 01:18:52.351
Is my...

01:18:53.427 --> 01:18:55.486
What? How can you ask me that?

01:18:55.796 --> 01:18:56.922
Is it?

01:18:58.098 --> 01:19:02.194
No, it's... It's Alamo Taylor.

01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:07.671
No. That's a lie, too.

01:19:08.942 --> 01:19:12.207
There I go, trying to impress
a bunch of kids again.

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:15.905
When are you gonna grow up?

01:19:16.016 --> 01:19:18.348
My real name is Bob Taylor.

01:19:18.819 --> 01:19:20.912
Not Robert, just Bob.

01:19:22.222 --> 01:19:25.350
There, you satisfied?
And I didn't kill anyone with a drill bit.

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.222
Although when I was in high school,

01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:29.818
I did puncture my pinky with a drill bit.

01:19:30.097 --> 01:19:33.066
And everyone started calling me Drillbit,
making fun of me.

01:19:33.167 --> 01:19:34.998
- Okay? And you can see the scar...
- No, get away.

01:19:35.102 --> 01:19:36.763
...if you look closely right there.
Can you see?

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:40.601
Look, Ryan, look, you can see it.
It's real. Look.

01:19:40.707 --> 01:19:41.799
Can you see it in the light?

01:19:41.909 --> 01:19:46.710
So you were just using us to take
our money and everything in my house?

01:19:54.321 --> 01:19:56.687
That's kind of an oversimplification.

01:19:58.258 --> 01:20:00.123
I thought you cared about us.

01:20:00.727 --> 01:20:03.093
I do. I just...

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:06.594
I thought you were my friend.

01:20:07.801 --> 01:20:10.531
Get out, Drillbit,
and don't ever come back.

01:20:16.009 --> 01:20:17.271
Leave!

01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:20.676
I'm sorry.

01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:29.889
Hello?

01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:31.218
<i>Hey. Yeah, look, I know...</i>

01:20:31.325 --> 01:20:33.020
<i>I'm sorry, I know</i>
<i>I was supposed to meet you,</i>

01:20:33.126 --> 01:20:35.822
<i>but I'm just having a real terrible day.</i>

01:20:35.963 --> 01:20:37.430
Where are you?

01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:42.001
Remember you said you had
that real self-destructive pattern

01:20:42.102 --> 01:20:47.130
of always going out with guys
that were just real losers, just dirtbags?

01:20:47.241 --> 01:20:49.209
<i>Total zeros.</i>

01:20:49.309 --> 01:20:51.038
- Yes.
- Well.

01:20:51.144 --> 01:20:53.806
You might not be
out of the woods yet with that.

01:20:54.014 --> 01:20:59.213
No, you said you were a doctor.
You're a doctor. You're not a doctor?

01:20:59.319 --> 01:21:00.786
No, I'm not a doctor.

01:21:00.888 --> 01:21:04.415
I'm a homeless U.S. Army deserter.
I was...

01:21:04.524 --> 01:21:07.516
I'm not a teacher, but I'm at the school.
I'm trying to protect these kids.

01:21:07.628 --> 01:21:10.392
What? What did you say
about homeless?

01:21:11.265 --> 01:21:15.531
Like, metaphorically speaking
or in a box?

01:21:18.705 --> 01:21:20.798
You got to let it out.

01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:25.100
You got to just let it out. Just...

01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:32.082
That's not it.

01:21:32.252 --> 01:21:35.915
<i>Drillbit? I mean, Bob. It's us, the guys.</i>

01:21:36.523 --> 01:21:39.583
<i>- Pick up, Bob.</i>
<i>- Yeah, pick up, Drillbit.</i>

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.449
Boys?

01:21:41.561 --> 01:21:44.029
<i>We just called to say</i>
<i>we're calling the cops on you,</i>

01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:47.862
<i>and we hope you spend the rest</i>
<i>of your pathetic life in prison!</i>

01:21:47.968 --> 01:21:51.665
<i>Now I see why people call you Drillbit.</i>
<i>Because you screw people!</i>

01:21:51.805 --> 01:21:54.672
<i>You're a jackass and a dirtbag.</i>

01:21:55.142 --> 01:21:57.372
<i>And I want my bar mitzvah money back.</i>

01:21:57.511 --> 01:22:00.742
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>and I'd like my walkie-talkie back. Over.</i>

01:22:07.054 --> 01:22:09.249
I tell you what,
I'll give you 1,500 for everything.

01:22:09.356 --> 01:22:10.653
1,500? Come on, man.

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:12.816
This stuff holds
a lot of sentimental value.

01:22:12.926 --> 01:22:15.554
- To who?
- To the people I stole it from.

01:22:15.662 --> 01:22:17.027
I don't care about them. 1,500.

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:19.598
All right. Deal. What do I do?
Just back this thing up?

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.827
- Yeah, back it right up.
- All right.

01:22:25.906 --> 01:22:27.737
How're you doing, Don?

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.470
You got a real stupid laugh,
you know that, Don?

01:22:34.748 --> 01:22:36.579
How about you go ahead
and hop on out of that van here,

01:22:36.683 --> 01:22:38.412
so I can kick your ass again?

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:41.248
Sorry, but this haul's getting
returned to sender.

01:22:41.355 --> 01:22:42.947
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it is, Don.

01:22:43.056 --> 01:22:44.387
And I'll tell you another thing
that's gonna happen.

01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:46.152
This left foot is gonna go
on the right side

01:22:46.259 --> 01:22:47.658
- of your face!
- Oh, give me a break, Drillbit.

01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:51.424
I know you and the Drillbit I know
isn't capable of really doing it!

01:22:55.802 --> 01:22:56.769
Hoo-rah!

01:22:58.271 --> 01:23:01.263
I'm giving you one more chance
to save this friendship!

01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:07.305
Damn it! You ready for this, Don?

01:23:08.682 --> 01:23:11.412
- No!
- Yeah!

01:23:16.289 --> 01:23:19.190
Polish that turd, Don!

01:23:22.896 --> 01:23:24.454
I'm dead.

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:26.589
- You're dead.
- I'm sad.

01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:32.065
Wade, what's wrong?
Is everything okay?

01:23:32.172 --> 01:23:34.436
Yeah, but you're not gonna
wanna go home.

01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:38.136
- Oh, no, no, no. The cable go out?
- If it is, you're dead.

01:23:39.479 --> 01:23:40.446
Of course it was your fault!

01:23:40.547 --> 01:23:42.071
You were home!
You should have stopped them!

01:23:42.182 --> 01:23:44.946
Bear with me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

01:23:45.052 --> 01:23:46.246
Oh, God.

01:23:46.653 --> 01:23:48.644
Please don't scream.

01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:51.891
What the hell?
I thought we were robbed!

01:23:51.992 --> 01:23:53.289
We were!

01:23:53.393 --> 01:23:55.953
We didn't get robbed!
We got rearranged!

01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:58.555
You and your weirdo friends
have a marijuana party?

01:23:58.665 --> 01:24:00.155
- No!
- Oh, honey.

01:24:00.267 --> 01:24:02.633
- Punish him, Dad.
- Yeah, don't let him get away with this.

01:24:02.736 --> 01:24:05.534
- Are you smoking pot?
- No. I'm really confused.

01:24:05.639 --> 01:24:08.335
No, no, Wade.
Drillbit must have done it.

01:24:08.942 --> 01:24:10.204
Who's Drillbit?

01:24:10.710 --> 01:24:12.507
You tell me what's going on now, Wade.

01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:15.345
I just... I think it's weird, you know,

01:24:15.449 --> 01:24:19.112
that this is what I get for trying to make
them feel like a part of the group.

01:24:19.219 --> 01:24:23.918
I mean, I saw it like a school tradition.
It's hazing, yeah, but

01:24:24.024 --> 01:24:26.117
just to, you know, make them
feel like they belonged.

01:24:26.226 --> 01:24:29.957
Sort of like a fun initiation.

01:24:30.063 --> 01:24:32.088
I mean, didn't you all have that
when you were kids?

01:24:32.199 --> 01:24:36.260
Yeah. I remember my first few days.
Got tied to the flagpole,

01:24:36.369 --> 01:24:39.099
egged a few times.
At the end of it, it's all laughs.

01:24:39.206 --> 01:24:41.766
Yeah, Wade, boys, you really
shouldn't have panicked like that.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:43.433
Yeah, this boy's not dangerous,

01:24:43.543 --> 01:24:46.205
not compared to a dirty,
homeless ex-soldier.

01:24:46.313 --> 01:24:49.840
The more I think about it,
that guy, he could've really hurt me.

01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:54.182
All right. I'm... I'm sorry, but your boys
brought a fugitive onto school property

01:24:54.287 --> 01:24:56.346
threatening the safety of my students.

01:24:56.456 --> 01:24:58.617
Now, I don't... I don't wanna point
any fingers here,

01:24:58.725 --> 01:25:01.421
but I think we all know who's to blame.

01:25:02.395 --> 01:25:04.695
You put my life in danger, guys.

01:25:05.132 --> 01:25:08.260
It's worse than any hazing
that anybody could do.

01:25:08.368 --> 01:25:10.233
I'm just lucky I was able
to defend myself.

01:25:10.337 --> 01:25:11.804
Who knows what might have happened?

01:25:11.905 --> 01:25:14.669
This guy's a veteran!
How many people might he have killed?

01:25:14.774 --> 01:25:16.605
Did anybody see "To Catch a Predator"
on <i>Dateline?</i>

01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:18.302
- I watched that!
- I saw that, yeah.

01:25:18.411 --> 01:25:20.504
It's where they set the booby trap
for the pedophiles.

01:25:20.614 --> 01:25:22.377
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- A grandfather, a priest...

01:25:22.482 --> 01:25:24.416
I mean, could you imagine it?
You think you're on a date,

01:25:24.518 --> 01:25:26.076
and then all of a sudden,
police are everywhere.

01:25:26.186 --> 01:25:27.744
- Yeah.
- My God, this guy knows where we live.

01:25:27.854 --> 01:25:28.821
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:25:28.922 --> 01:25:33.291
I think you'll be glad to know I gave
security camera footage of this Drillbit

01:25:33.393 --> 01:25:36.123
to the police and they said
they'd be watching for him.

01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:38.390
No, what the hell's the matter
with you guys?

01:25:38.498 --> 01:25:40.932
Are you mentally defective
or something?

01:25:41.034 --> 01:25:43.161
You got to understand,
Drillbit was around because

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.135
this psychopath over here
was gonna murder us!

01:25:45.238 --> 01:25:47.536
I mean, Filkins is the real criminal!

01:25:47.641 --> 01:25:48.938
Yes! He has a samurai sword

01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:50.703
- he has used on his other victims!
- All right...

01:25:55.749 --> 01:25:56.841
Sit down!

01:25:58.518 --> 01:26:00.076
Sit down!

01:26:00.654 --> 01:26:01.951
Thank you very much.

01:26:02.055 --> 01:26:03.249
Now, Terry.

01:26:04.157 --> 01:26:06.455
Is there any truth to this?

01:26:07.327 --> 01:26:09.318
Oh, yeah. All of it.

01:26:10.764 --> 01:26:14.962
I'm really a samurai warrior from
the 14th century sent to kill them.

01:26:19.105 --> 01:26:20.538
He's cute.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.507
Okay, I hope I speak for everyone here

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:27.011
in saying that I feel
this issue is resolved.

01:26:27.113 --> 01:26:28.102
- Thank you. Okay, okay.
- All right?

01:26:28.215 --> 01:26:29.807
Very good.
Thank you for coming in, folks.

01:26:29.916 --> 01:26:31.816
- Thank you.
- All right, yeah.

01:26:31.918 --> 01:26:33.977
- Hey, wasn't that fun?
- Hell, yeah.

01:26:34.087 --> 01:26:35.452
- Oh, my goodness!
- Great.

01:26:35.555 --> 01:26:36.522
- You feel better now, honey?
- Terry, honey.

01:26:36.623 --> 01:26:38.056
I did not know you were all alone.

01:26:38.158 --> 01:26:40.251
We want to have you over to the house
for dinner, okay?

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.796
- That would be wonderful!
- Wade could use more friends.

01:26:50.737 --> 01:26:52.466
Give me one, please.

01:26:56.243 --> 01:26:59.701
You're kind of a born loser. It's funny.

01:27:00.413 --> 01:27:01.903
It's not funny.

01:27:02.182 --> 01:27:03.774
It's funny to me.

01:27:04.184 --> 01:27:06.982
Come on, don't jinx me. Don't jinx me.

01:27:08.855 --> 01:27:11.881
500! Yes! Yes! I did it!

01:27:11.992 --> 01:27:13.391
- I got it, man!
- Dude!

01:27:13.493 --> 01:27:14.755
Look at that! Yes!

01:27:14.861 --> 01:27:16.055
You got a ticket to Canada!

01:27:16.162 --> 01:27:18.392
You better believe it! Come on, man!

01:27:18.498 --> 01:27:20.728
Finally! Finally, I get one!

01:27:20.867 --> 01:27:24.234
Come here, you!
This candy's on me! Put it down!

01:27:24.537 --> 01:27:28.166
You got it! Well, maybe just get
one of them. Here. Here you go!

01:27:41.288 --> 01:27:43.415
Okay, keep your eyes peeled.

01:27:46.493 --> 01:27:49.291
- Do you see Filkins?
- No, but I see Brooke.

01:27:49.763 --> 01:27:52.357
Gonna go for it. I'm gonna ask her out.

01:27:53.166 --> 01:27:54.394
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:57.565
- You waited all this time. Why now?
- Why not?

01:27:58.004 --> 01:28:00.438
My life sucks so badly,
even if she says no,

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.599
it's not like I'll have very far to fall.

01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:09.075
I don't know.

01:28:10.450 --> 01:28:13.078
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:15.586
Look, I don't know how to do this.

01:28:16.222 --> 01:28:19.419
In fact, I've been wanting to do this
for a while. I just didn't know

01:28:19.526 --> 01:28:21.118
when would be a good time. I don't...

01:28:21.227 --> 01:28:25.425
I didn't know if it would ever be
a good time. I mean, if I'd ever think...

01:28:28.768 --> 01:28:30.395
It's okay, Brooke.

01:28:32.739 --> 01:28:35.970
Yo, bro, I swear to God
those ain't my sodas,

01:28:36.076 --> 01:28:38.977
but if you wanted to, say, hire me
or something, like a bodyguard,

01:28:39.079 --> 01:28:43.175
I think maybe I could dedicate my life
to finding the real culprit.

01:28:45.719 --> 01:28:48.586
Wade, come on.
I'm okay with this, so let's just go.

01:28:48.688 --> 01:28:50.588
What'd you say, ho?

01:28:50.957 --> 01:28:52.515
Okay, you know what?
What is your problem?

01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:54.616
Why don't you just leave them alone?

01:28:54.728 --> 01:28:57.526
What are you gonna do, bro?
What are you gonna do?

01:28:59.432 --> 01:29:03.300
You aren't gonna do anything,
because you don't have any balls.

01:29:04.504 --> 01:29:06.836
- Leave him alone!
- It's just not in you.

01:29:12.045 --> 01:29:14.275
You see? Look at that.

01:29:15.248 --> 01:29:16.545
Sackless!

01:29:21.321 --> 01:29:24.916
Why do you even waste my time?
You're pathetic.

01:29:30.497 --> 01:29:32.226
You all right, Wade?

01:29:32.632 --> 01:29:34.623
- Don't worry about that guy.
- He's just insecure inside.

01:29:34.734 --> 01:29:37.100
- Get up. Let's get out of here.
- Wade?

01:29:37.203 --> 01:29:38.693
Where are you going?

01:29:38.805 --> 01:29:41.239
- T-Dog! Stop him!
- Fight! Fight!

01:29:44.043 --> 01:29:45.032
Come on, Wade!

01:29:45.145 --> 01:29:47.511
I'll kick the crap out of you right now.
You know why?

01:29:47.614 --> 01:29:50.640
Half because
everyone is sick of your garbage

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:53.275
and half because
of what you said to Brooke!

01:29:55.054 --> 01:29:56.885
Do you think I'm dumb?

01:29:57.824 --> 01:29:59.951
Trying to trick me
into getting myself in trouble?

01:30:00.059 --> 01:30:03.051
Fine. Then we'll beat your face in
somewhere else.

01:30:03.163 --> 01:30:05.154
- Anywhere. Go ahead. You name it.
- Okay, good.

01:30:05.265 --> 01:30:09.827
Everybody! Everybody! I'm gonna kick
their asses tonight at my house!

01:30:10.236 --> 01:30:13.330
Everybody should come!
It's gonna be hilarious!

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.403
Ultimate Geek Fighting!

01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:20.076
Once you step on my property,
you're freaking trespassing, brother,

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.943
and I can do anything I want.

01:30:22.048 --> 01:30:23.879
You're nothing but a pathetic wimp,

01:30:23.983 --> 01:30:27.111
and everyone's gonna know
by the end of tonight, brother!

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.915
And I will see you there!

01:30:36.296 --> 01:30:38.025
What have I just done?

01:30:38.364 --> 01:30:40.229
That was awesome, man.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.027
- Me and Emmit are gonna back you up.
- Oh, now it's "me and Emmit."

01:30:44.137 --> 01:30:46.833
You've never been nice to me, Ryan,
and I've only been kind to you.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:49.170
And I've tried so hard
to make this friendship work,

01:30:49.275 --> 01:30:52.642
but I am not going to die
for someone who won't die for me!

01:30:52.745 --> 01:30:56.374
"Survival technique."
I renounce violence.

01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:58.977
I have a future!

01:31:00.119 --> 01:31:01.814
What do we do next?

01:31:02.722 --> 01:31:05.282
Guess we'd better learn how to fight.

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.885
- Jump left, jump left.
- Come on, Blue.

01:31:08.995 --> 01:31:10.326
- That's what I'm talking about!
- No, no, no, no.

01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:11.988
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Come on!

01:31:12.098 --> 01:31:13.292
Come on! Yes!

01:31:13.433 --> 01:31:15.697
This PowerBar's really working.

01:31:15.802 --> 01:31:17.360
I feel stronger.

01:31:18.238 --> 01:31:19.569
I feel fatter.

01:31:19.672 --> 01:31:21.469
<i>Well, what do you want me to do?</i>
<i>You just want me to hit you?</i>

01:31:21.574 --> 01:31:23.804
<i>Come on. Do me this one favor.</i>

01:31:26.012 --> 01:31:27.604
That was perfect!

01:31:29.082 --> 01:31:32.142
All right. We need to learn
how to take a punch.

01:31:32.485 --> 01:31:34.544
You ready? Let me go first.

01:31:35.388 --> 01:31:36.980
- All right?
- Okay.

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:52.135
Block out the pain.

01:31:52.238 --> 01:31:54.832
Remember what that douche bag
Drillbit taught us?

01:31:54.941 --> 01:31:57.341
- Mind over pain!
- Okay.

01:31:57.443 --> 01:32:00.241
All right. Hit me in the chest.

01:32:02.982 --> 01:32:03.949
Jeez!

01:32:05.785 --> 01:32:07.616
- Your knuckles are all bone!
- All right.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.620
We get to call how hard
the other guy hits.

01:32:09.722 --> 01:32:13.317
All right. Ten being the hardest,
how hard do you want it?

01:32:13.426 --> 01:32:16.054
Five. In the back. In the back.

01:32:20.667 --> 01:32:21.827
Oh, God!

01:32:21.935 --> 01:32:25.598
Wonder what it feels like getting hit
in the middle of the forehead.

01:32:28.374 --> 01:32:29.341
Jeez!

01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:32.973
- All right, new rules!
- Okay.

01:32:33.079 --> 01:32:34.341
I'm not gonna tell you
where I'm gonna hit you.

01:32:34.447 --> 01:32:35.539
- No, I don't like that rule.
- No, it's good.

01:32:35.648 --> 01:32:37.513
- No, it's not good.
- It's good. It simulates a real fight.

01:32:37.617 --> 01:32:39.710
- Trust me.
- All right, fine.

01:32:44.023 --> 01:32:45.320
I can't see this coming.

01:32:45.425 --> 01:32:47.086
There's no way Wade can hurt me.

01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:50.687
Not balls!

01:32:51.798 --> 01:32:53.356
You hit me in the nuts!

01:32:55.368 --> 01:32:58.496
<i>Dear Mom, if you're reading this,</i>

01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:01.739
<i>it's very possible that I'm dead.</i>

01:33:04.944 --> 01:33:09.005
<i>If I don't survive, you should definitely</i>
<i>sue Emmit's family.</i>

01:33:09.382 --> 01:33:13.011
<i>P.S. Sorry I let your silver platter</i>
<i>get stolen.</i>

01:33:13.219 --> 01:33:15.551
<i>My raps and rhymes will become</i>
<i>more valuable now.</i>

01:33:15.655 --> 01:33:17.555
<i>You're free to sell them</i>
<i>to Ghostface Killah.</i>

01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:25.254
Remember the plan.
Strike first and strike hard.

01:33:25.365 --> 01:33:28.027
You go for the head. I'll go for the nuts.

01:34:10.376 --> 01:34:13.243
It actually looks like a pretty cool party.

01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:17.480
Oh! Hey, guys.

01:34:17.617 --> 01:34:22.350
So, how does it feel to know
that death is just a few moments away?

01:34:22.989 --> 01:34:25.457
- Where's Filkins?
- In the kitchen.

01:34:28.394 --> 01:34:30.089
In case we don't make it,

01:34:32.198 --> 01:34:34.564
- I don't want to have any regrets.
- Yeah.

01:34:36.302 --> 01:34:37.360
Face!

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:43.101
I've already got the first hit
out of the way.

01:34:43.209 --> 01:34:44.471
Let's get some.

01:35:00.626 --> 01:35:02.787
Hey! Hey, hey. Everybody, everybody!

01:35:03.129 --> 01:35:04.687
These kids actually came!

01:35:04.797 --> 01:35:07.925
These are the Siamese queers
I've been telling you about!

01:35:08.701 --> 01:35:11.363
They showed up!
They really are that dumb!

01:35:11.738 --> 01:35:13.205
I hate when he calls me that.

01:35:13.306 --> 01:35:16.002
So we're gonna have a good time!
Because they...

01:35:24.684 --> 01:35:25.742
It worked.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.111
- It's over!
- That was easy.

01:35:29.288 --> 01:35:31.381
- We did it, we did it!
- We did.

01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:35.621
Everybody, from ninth grade
to twelfth grade,

01:35:35.862 --> 01:35:38.695
I promise you,
his reign of tyranny is over!

01:35:39.365 --> 01:35:42.698
I proclaim it!
He will never bother us again!

01:35:44.737 --> 01:35:46.204
And he's getting up!

01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.430
You're dead.

01:35:49.542 --> 01:35:51.203
And I'm in big trouble!

01:36:05.258 --> 01:36:08.750
Catch me off guard?
You broke my stairs.

01:36:09.395 --> 01:36:11.454
My father loved those stairs!

01:36:16.269 --> 01:36:17.668
You blocking out the pain?

01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:20.034
I thought I was for a second,
but I'm totally not.

01:36:20.139 --> 01:36:21.766
You want to play?

01:36:22.608 --> 01:36:23.700
Let's play.

01:36:40.226 --> 01:36:43.354
Get up, get up, get up! Come on, Ryan.

01:36:44.497 --> 01:36:48.365
You're like, super-hot.
I'm never gonna leave you.

01:36:48.467 --> 01:36:51.197
- Ronnie! You're missing out.
- Okay.

01:36:52.471 --> 01:36:53.768
Hey, boys!

01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:00.308
Yo, Jay, give me some murder music.

01:37:01.314 --> 01:37:04.147
This just gets better and better.

01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:12.789
All right!

01:37:14.794 --> 01:37:16.728
Hey, yo, yo. Back off.

01:37:16.863 --> 01:37:18.990
I want to fight both these bitches.

01:37:19.232 --> 01:37:23.225
They're yours, Filk!
They're yours, baby! Here we go.

01:37:23.336 --> 01:37:25.201
- You're the bitch!
- Huh?

01:37:30.509 --> 01:37:31.942
That's right!

01:37:33.512 --> 01:37:34.604
What the...

01:37:36.716 --> 01:37:39.082
- Emmit's got game!
- Oh, yeah!

01:37:42.154 --> 01:37:44.247
- Good one, Ron!
- Come on!

01:37:46.025 --> 01:37:47.959
Bear hug!

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.288
- Come on!
- Oh!

01:37:59.839 --> 01:38:03.172
I have reach! I have reach!

01:38:05.177 --> 01:38:08.613
Come on, Wade!
You're like Rocky! Get back out there!

01:38:10.383 --> 01:38:14.114
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- You're not gonna hurt me anymore?

01:38:14.387 --> 01:38:17.515
I won't hurt you! You should let go!
I can't breathe, Ryan, can't breathe!

01:38:17.623 --> 01:38:21.081
I'll let you go.
Not gonna hurt me anymore, are...

01:38:22.662 --> 01:38:25.495
- I have reach!
- No! Wade!

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.865
Hey! Hey, there. Hey...

01:38:31.704 --> 01:38:33.103
- Didn't hurt!
- Really?

01:38:33.205 --> 01:38:34.297
Yeah.

01:38:34.507 --> 01:38:36.202
Okay, that did.

01:38:38.811 --> 01:38:40.369
Let that kid go.

01:38:45.284 --> 01:38:48.447
Private Drillbit Taylor reporting for duty!

01:38:48.988 --> 01:38:50.922
- Hoo-rah.
- You came back?

01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:54.059
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you even doing here?

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.853
What, you need more money
from these geeks?

01:38:56.963 --> 01:38:59.864
No. But this fight is over!

01:39:00.533 --> 01:39:02.763
You hear me? <i>Abierto!</i>

01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:06.038
Done.

01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.709
It's over, people! Pack it up! Go home!

01:39:10.977 --> 01:39:16.643
Look. You're a young man. You got...
You got a crazy look in your eye.

01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:20.143
And it's really freaking me out right now.

01:39:24.490 --> 01:39:25.684
Nice punch.

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:30.026
I try to be reasonable,
but I got to tell you,

01:39:30.262 --> 01:39:35.564
these boys hired me as their bodyguard
and I will protect them!

01:39:40.106 --> 01:39:41.596
Want to hear something crazy?

01:39:41.707 --> 01:39:44.175
Deep inside you,
I know there's a good kid.

01:39:46.879 --> 01:39:50.371
God damn it,
I'm sick of getting hit by this kid.

01:39:50.583 --> 01:39:52.210
Come on, Drillbit. Kick his ass.

01:39:52.318 --> 01:39:56.220
- I can't! He's a minor!
- No, he's not. He's 18.

01:39:57.223 --> 01:39:59.123
You're 18?

01:40:05.197 --> 01:40:06.892
That's it.

01:40:16.475 --> 01:40:17.442
Drillbit!

01:40:19.145 --> 01:40:20.407
How old are you?

01:40:20.513 --> 01:40:23.277
Okay! All right, I'm 17. I'm a minor.

01:40:23.382 --> 01:40:24.474
- My mom drives me to school.
- Come on!

01:40:24.583 --> 01:40:25.845
I swear to God!

01:40:26.352 --> 01:40:27.649
That was awesome.

01:40:27.753 --> 01:40:30.244
Man, Drillbit, you're badass.

01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:33.051
I don't think I could do that again.

01:40:33.325 --> 01:40:35.122
It's weird. I guess it's like

01:40:35.227 --> 01:40:38.219
when a mother
lifts an automobile off a child.

01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:39.991
- Yeah.
- You just get that burst of strength.

01:40:40.099 --> 01:40:41.657
That's the only way I can explain it.

01:40:41.767 --> 01:40:44.668
Adrenaline. That's the word for it.

01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:48.001
My hands are...
My hands are still shaking.

01:40:48.607 --> 01:40:51.508
- Thanks for coming back.
- You kidding me? I had to do it.

01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:53.544
I'm not gonna go AWOL on you boys.

01:40:53.646 --> 01:40:55.443
I made that mistake one...

01:40:55.681 --> 01:40:59.447
Crap on a shit sandwich!
I'm out of here, boys! <i>Adi√≥s!</i>

01:41:00.319 --> 01:41:01.547
Bye, Drillbit!

01:41:01.787 --> 01:41:02.845
Hey, fags!

01:41:04.957 --> 01:41:06.652
This ain't over!

01:41:17.636 --> 01:41:19.501
- He feels no pain.
- Whoa.

01:41:23.342 --> 01:41:24.741
Was that my pinky?

01:41:28.547 --> 01:41:31.015
- Are you okay?
- My finger!

01:41:31.117 --> 01:41:32.084
You okay?

01:41:32.218 --> 01:41:33.879
- I'm so sorry.
- Why did I catch a sword?

01:41:33.986 --> 01:41:35.453
- I lost it. No, no.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

01:41:35.554 --> 01:41:38.990
- I lost it.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:40.922
No, it's okay. I'm blocking the pain.

01:41:41.026 --> 01:41:43.426
I can't block this pain.
Get some ice for me.

01:41:43.529 --> 01:41:44.962
It's not bad. Here, help me find it

01:41:45.064 --> 01:41:46.292
- before the ants get it.
- Where'd you last see it?

01:41:46.398 --> 01:41:48.298
- Look in the grass.
- My dad, yo, just don't tell my dad!

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.560
Help me, guys!
Find it before a rat gets it!

01:41:49.668 --> 01:41:50.896
See it? Look over there.

01:41:51.003 --> 01:41:52.197
- Is that it?
- Where?

01:41:52.304 --> 01:41:54.101
Hey, guys, I found it!

01:41:56.242 --> 01:41:57.504
No!

01:41:58.444 --> 01:41:59.570
We found it.

01:42:01.313 --> 01:42:02.405
Get me some ice.

01:42:02.515 --> 01:42:03.513
- Ice!
- Ice!

01:42:03.616 --> 01:42:04.674
Margarita all right?

01:42:04.783 --> 01:42:06.512
Oh, my God.

01:42:06.619 --> 01:42:07.677
Bro!

01:42:07.786 --> 01:42:09.219
Come on, buddy.
We got to get you to a hospital.

01:42:09.321 --> 01:42:11.653
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:42:11.757 --> 01:42:13.486
It's gonna be okay.

01:42:13.592 --> 01:42:16.891
Congratulations, boys.
You just caught the great Bob Taylor.

01:42:16.996 --> 01:42:19.123
Fantastic. No alcohol in the car, sir.

01:42:19.231 --> 01:42:21.893
Oh, yeah.
Well, let me get the finger out.

01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:26.264
Hoo-rah.

01:42:28.841 --> 01:42:31.071
- Yo, dudes, that was awesome!
- Thanks, man.

01:42:31.177 --> 01:42:33.236
Man, you have no idea how long kids
have been waiting to do that.

01:42:33.345 --> 01:42:34.835
- Thanks.
- Dude, this is gonna be blogged,

01:42:34.947 --> 01:42:35.914
for sure!

01:42:36.015 --> 01:42:38.711
I am so glad
I did not go to my sister's birthday party!

01:42:39.652 --> 01:42:40.641
Hey.

01:42:40.753 --> 01:42:42.277
He was amazing.

01:42:42.922 --> 01:42:44.685
You know,
Terry's just always been crazy.

01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:46.849
You know, he's threatened me
with his sword all the time.

01:42:46.959 --> 01:42:48.756
I'm just tired of being scared, you know?

01:42:48.861 --> 01:42:51.352
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:58.100
When the adrenaline rush passes,
I'm gonna be in a lot more pain.

01:42:59.805 --> 01:43:02.672
I don't want you to think I'm the kind of
guy who tries to impress girls

01:43:02.775 --> 01:43:05.801
with violence,
but that was kind of for you.

01:43:07.479 --> 01:43:10.107
That was very brave of you.

01:43:20.259 --> 01:43:23.456
You know, Emmit,
I can't believe I'm saying this...

01:43:24.964 --> 01:43:29.060
You, my friend, are one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

01:43:29.168 --> 01:43:31.193
You have no idea how scared I was.

01:43:31.303 --> 01:43:34.568
All right. Now, let's go get
something to eat. I'm starving.

01:43:38.444 --> 01:43:41.607
<i>Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.</i>

01:43:41.714 --> 01:43:44.114
<i>Thanks for sending the Cap'n Crunch.</i>

01:43:44.283 --> 01:43:46.274
<i>Suddenly, I'm very popular in here.</i>

01:43:46.385 --> 01:43:50.947
Hey, Bob. Give me some of that Cap'n
Crunch or I'll stab you in the shower.

01:43:53.058 --> 01:43:54.252
Just kidding.

01:43:56.762 --> 01:43:59.390
<i>I was glad to read</i>
<i>in your last correspondence</i>

01:43:59.498 --> 01:44:02.934
<i>that Filkins was shipped off</i>
<i>back to Hong Kong</i>

01:44:03.035 --> 01:44:06.664
<i>to be with his parents for breaking</i>
<i>so many underage drinking laws.</i>

01:44:07.206 --> 01:44:10.642
<i>Now maybe high school can be</i>
<i>what you want it to be</i>

01:44:10.743 --> 01:44:12.643
<i>- instead of sucking rat nads.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

01:44:13.812 --> 01:44:14.904
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:44:15.581 --> 01:44:18.948
<i>As for me, every time I look</i>
<i>at where my pinky used to be,</i>

01:44:19.184 --> 01:44:22.153
<i>I think of you boys</i>
<i>and our battles together.</i>

01:44:22.588 --> 01:44:23.953
It's kind of cool.

01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:26.483
<i>Luckily, they have</i>
<i>a work release program,</i>

01:44:26.592 --> 01:44:28.890
<i>and they say I should</i>
<i>be able to land a job,</i>

01:44:28.994 --> 01:44:30.825
<i>which excites me a great deal.</i>

01:44:30.929 --> 01:44:33.227
<i>And speaking of exciting me</i>
<i>a great deal,</i>

01:44:33.332 --> 01:44:35.630
<i>Miss Zachey and I
<i>have been in contact.</i></i>

01:44:35.768 --> 01:44:39.602
<i>I don't know why women dig</i>
<i>guys in prison, but they really do.</i>

01:44:39.705 --> 01:44:43.607
<i>On top of that, all I can say is,</i>
<i>I miss you guys</i>

01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:45.472
<i>and will see you when I get out.</i>

01:44:45.577 --> 01:44:49.411
<i>Which, thanks to the currently lenient</i>
<i>nature of the United States Army</i>

01:44:49.515 --> 01:44:52.143
<i>deserting laws is in two days from now,</i>

01:44:52.284 --> 01:44:55.515
<i>officially satisfying</i>
<i>my three-week sentence.</i>

01:44:55.954 --> 01:44:58.149
<i>- Your brother, Bob Taylor.</i>
- See you, Drillbit.

01:44:58.257 --> 01:45:01.055
<i>- AKA Drillbit.</i>
- Later, bro.

01:45:01.293 --> 01:45:04.353
<i>AKA, Alamo Taylor.</i>

01:45:04.897 --> 01:45:07.263
<i>I still like the sound of that.</i>

01:45:10.135 --> 01:45:11.932
There you are!

01:45:13.072 --> 01:45:14.562
- Drillbit!
- Come on.

01:45:14.673 --> 01:45:15.970
- Oh, my God.
- There he is.

01:45:16.075 --> 01:45:17.872
Come on, get in here!
Come here! Fall in!

01:45:17.976 --> 01:45:20.274
- He's a free man!
- Give me a hug!

01:45:20.412 --> 01:45:22.243
Give me a hug. Yeah.

01:45:22.581 --> 01:45:25.015
Well, that's gonna keep me smiling
all day, huh?

01:45:25.117 --> 01:45:26.607
Yeah, that's my buddy, Drillbit.

01:45:26.719 --> 01:45:28.277
He's a cool guy.
We're in a fight right now.

01:45:28.387 --> 01:45:29.848
This has been the longest
three weeks of my life.

01:45:29.955 --> 01:45:31.320
I missed you, too.

01:45:32.024 --> 01:45:33.821
- Feels good.
- You gonna shake the jail?

01:45:33.926 --> 01:45:35.826
- It wasn't that bad.
- Come on, let's go.

01:45:35.928 --> 01:45:38.624
You know, the guy in the next cell taught
me some Spanish.

01:45:38.731 --> 01:45:41.996
Did you know <i>abierto</i> means "open"?

01:49:35.267 --> 01:49:37.633
Help! I'm bleeding!

01:49:38.904 --> 01:49:41.930
Come here, soldier.
Let me take a look at that.

01:49:42.407 --> 01:49:44.341
Come here. Jump up there.

01:49:44.443 --> 01:49:49.278
You got a little bloody nose.
Tilt your head back, 45-degree angle.

01:49:50.282 --> 01:49:52.807
- What happened?
- Somebody punched me.

01:49:54.319 --> 01:50:00.007
Tell me his name. Names.
It'll never happen again.

01:50:59.815 --> 01:51:00.815
