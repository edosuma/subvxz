WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.506
Oh!

00:02.538 --> 00:04.710
She's absolutely adorable!

00:04.742 --> 00:06.813
He.

00:06.847 --> 00:09.820
Oh, sorry.
He's dressed all in pink.

00:09.853 --> 00:11.424
That's his favorite color.

00:11.456 --> 00:13.828
Oh, that's fun for him.

00:13.861 --> 00:15.599
Fantastic.

00:15.631 --> 00:18.705
Oh, wow, look at that.
How cute.

00:18.737 --> 00:20.142
Thank you.

00:20.174 --> 00:21.376
Oh, may I?

00:21.411 --> 00:23.047
Sure.

00:24.882 --> 00:28.690
(Michael)
Hey, look at me!
I'm a baby!

00:28.725 --> 00:30.729
I'm one of those babies
from Look Who's Talking.

00:30.761 --> 00:32.599
What am I thinking?

00:32.633 --> 00:34.837
[laughs]
Look at all those staplers.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.141
What's a stapler?
I don't even know.

00:36.174 --> 00:38.178
I'm a baby.
Hey, Mom!

00:38.211 --> 00:39.847
I'm thirsty.

00:39.879 --> 00:41.550
I'm thirsty, Mama.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.121
I want some milk.

00:43.155 --> 00:45.859
And you know where
milk comes from.

00:45.891 --> 00:47.395
Breasts!

00:47.428 --> 00:48.731
[guffaws]

00:48.765 --> 00:52.873
[cheerful music]

00:52.905 --> 01:01.190
*

01:22.598 --> 01:23.867
Hey.
Hey.

01:26.373 --> 01:28.877
You almost done?

01:28.911 --> 01:32.453
Just about, yeah.

01:32.485 --> 01:33.855
Now.

01:33.888 --> 01:36.327
(Jim)
Yes, I've started
to see Karen.

01:36.361 --> 01:39.700
It's very new,
and I'm not really ready

01:39.733 --> 01:41.404
to talk about it
openly yet just because

01:41.436 --> 01:43.741
I think once the word
gets out there,

01:43.775 --> 01:45.944
it might affect the way
people behave around us.

01:45.979 --> 01:49.320
Or...I don't know.

01:49.353 --> 01:51.824
Just not yet.

01:51.857 --> 01:55.865
Yeah, Jan, it, um,
looks like a check.

01:55.899 --> 01:57.736
A piece of paper
of some sort.

01:57.769 --> 01:58.905
A receipt.

01:58.938 --> 02:00.241
Jan, this is Angela Martin
from accounting.

02:00.241 --> 02:01.977
(Jan)
Mm-hmm.

02:02.010 --> 02:02.879
Look, we have a rebate

02:02.912 --> 02:05.652
from the Federal Work
Opportunity Program.

02:05.684 --> 02:06.986
And no one knows
what that means.

02:07.021 --> 02:09.859
We get that money
for hiring an ex-convict.

02:09.892 --> 02:12.698
I didn't hire
an ex-convict.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.802
Unless they mean Toby.

02:14.837 --> 02:16.072
Convicted rapist.

02:16.105 --> 02:17.943
[Jan huffs]

02:17.975 --> 02:18.977
I'm just kidding.

02:19.011 --> 02:20.849
When did the check come?

02:20.882 --> 02:21.817
Last week.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.955
Okay, that's when
the branches merged,

02:23.987 --> 02:25.991
so Josh must've been taking
advantage of this program.

02:26.025 --> 02:27.363
Smart move.

02:27.396 --> 02:28.997
One of the Stamford
people is a criminal?

02:29.031 --> 02:31.001
Hey, Jan,
speaking of Stamford,

02:31.035 --> 02:32.939
Hannah brought in
her baby.

02:32.973 --> 02:35.678
Jan, which one of new
employees is a criminal?

02:35.711 --> 02:39.420
A reformed convict.
And I'm not sure.

02:39.453 --> 02:40.654
Though hang on.
Let me email our H.R.

02:40.688 --> 02:41.957
Stay on the line.

02:41.991 --> 02:43.361
[whispering]
Who is it?

02:43.395 --> 02:45.365
Hannah?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.867
(Kevin)
Hmm.

02:46.901 --> 02:49.038
Andy?

02:49.070 --> 02:51.810
(Angela)
Andy.

02:51.844 --> 02:54.483
Martin?

02:54.517 --> 02:55.985
Oh, you are such a racist.

02:56.019 --> 02:57.923
Wait, why am I a racist?

02:57.956 --> 02:59.025
Because you think
he's black.

02:59.058 --> 03:02.466
He is black, right?

03:02.499 --> 03:04.937
Stop it.
Stop it right now!

03:04.969 --> 03:06.707
(Jan)
Okay, it's someone
named Martin Nash.

03:06.741 --> 03:08.042
Yeah!

03:08.076 --> 03:09.010
Michael?

03:09.044 --> 03:12.184
Why did the convict
have to be a black guy?

03:12.218 --> 03:15.759
It is such a stereotype.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.965
I just wish that Josh had made
a more progressive choice,

03:18.998 --> 03:22.004
like a white guy...

03:22.036 --> 03:23.941
who went to prison

03:23.975 --> 03:28.817
for polluting
a black guy's lake.

03:28.850 --> 03:30.153
I wonder what he did.

03:30.186 --> 03:32.858
In our society,

03:32.892 --> 03:35.465
a black man
can be arrested

03:35.499 --> 03:38.804
for almost anything.

03:38.837 --> 03:41.676
He was probably
at a sporting event

03:41.711 --> 03:44.617
and saw some people
pushing each other.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.252
And he intervened.

03:46.285 --> 03:49.025
Why would anyone
go to jail for that?

03:49.058 --> 03:51.194
So...

03:51.229 --> 03:53.266
what we need to do

03:53.299 --> 03:54.970
is to forget

03:55.003 --> 03:57.242
about this whole
"Martin in prison" thing.

03:57.274 --> 03:59.011
People will draw

03:59.045 --> 04:00.481
unfair conclusions
about Martin

04:00.481 --> 04:02.184
and/or black people.

04:02.217 --> 04:05.992
Cool.
Okay.

04:06.025 --> 04:07.027
Angela?

04:08.764 --> 04:10.534
Sure.

04:10.569 --> 04:12.271
Let's protect the convicts

04:12.305 --> 04:14.075
at the expense
of the general feeling

04:14.107 --> 04:15.812
of safety in the workplace.

04:15.845 --> 04:19.118
As a 90-pound female
that sits in an ill-lit,

04:19.150 --> 04:21.221
rarely-visited corner
of the office,

04:21.255 --> 04:23.158
naturally
I agree with that.

04:23.193 --> 04:25.063
Good.

04:25.097 --> 04:26.265
All right.

04:29.105 --> 04:31.876
[ring]

04:31.911 --> 04:33.079
Jim Halpert.

04:33.113 --> 04:35.652
I am so horny.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.064
Okay, I can't help you
with that.

04:42.097 --> 04:45.772
Oh, I think you can,
Big Tuna.

04:45.804 --> 04:48.645
Tell me about that
Indian chick Kelly.

04:48.678 --> 04:50.180
She seems pretty slutty.

04:50.213 --> 04:52.117
Good for a romp
in the sack.

04:52.151 --> 04:54.922
She is dating Ryan,
I think.

04:54.956 --> 04:57.127
Oh, and I care why?

04:57.161 --> 04:58.865
She's high maintenance.

04:58.897 --> 05:00.601
Next.
How about...

05:04.140 --> 05:05.945
[silently]

05:08.183 --> 05:09.250
Blondes are more fun.

05:09.284 --> 05:10.654
Come on,
trust me on that.

05:10.689 --> 05:11.691
Yeah, trust me.

05:11.723 --> 05:14.095
That would be fun
for no one.

05:14.128 --> 05:16.064
Okay, fine.
Okay.

05:16.099 --> 05:18.203
Pam, the receptionist.

05:18.236 --> 05:22.110
Pam.
Should I go for it?

05:28.423 --> 05:30.829
Absolutely you should.

05:30.861 --> 05:32.096
Jackpot.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.201
Just try to be cool.

05:34.235 --> 05:35.203
I am cool.

05:35.237 --> 05:36.340
Are you cool really?

05:36.373 --> 05:37.709
I'm so cool.

05:37.743 --> 05:39.044
Tell me what is
going on.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.079
[exhales deeply]

05:40.112 --> 05:44.154
Um, Martin from Stamford

05:44.188 --> 05:47.261
was at one time in prison.

05:50.969 --> 05:54.275
No, Dwight.
Be cool, be cool.

05:54.308 --> 05:55.142
I am greatly concerned

05:55.176 --> 05:57.281
about having a convict
in the office.

05:57.314 --> 06:00.052
And I do not care
if that convict is white,

06:00.086 --> 06:02.191
black, Asian, German,

06:02.224 --> 06:04.930
or some kind of halfsie.

06:04.962 --> 06:07.200
I do not like criminals.

06:17.521 --> 06:19.325
[whistles]

06:19.358 --> 06:21.763
Oh, God.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.072
All righty.
Let's get started.

06:26.104 --> 06:27.508
What is she into?

06:27.541 --> 06:29.210
I know Pam pretty well.

06:29.244 --> 06:30.949
I know the things
that she likes.

06:30.981 --> 06:32.819
And just as important,

06:32.853 --> 06:34.388
I know the things
that she hates.

06:34.422 --> 06:37.594
So one of the things
that she likes is pranks.

06:37.627 --> 06:41.034
And the things
that she hates...

06:41.069 --> 06:42.405
Frisbee-based
competitions.

06:42.438 --> 06:44.308
Are you kidding?

06:44.341 --> 06:46.379
I started the main
Frisbee golf club

06:46.413 --> 06:49.117
at Cornell
where I went to college.

06:49.150 --> 06:50.421
I live to frolf.

06:50.454 --> 06:52.091
Lead off with that.

06:52.123 --> 06:53.326
Okay.

06:53.359 --> 06:55.097
She loves hunting.

06:55.129 --> 06:58.168
She also loves those ads
for Six Flags

06:58.202 --> 06:59.204
with the old guy.

06:59.237 --> 07:00.841
[humming Six Flags
commercial jingle]

07:00.841 --> 07:02.578
Got it.

07:02.611 --> 07:05.951
Also...do you speak
pig Latin?

07:05.985 --> 07:08.256
Hey, Martin.
How's it going?

07:08.288 --> 07:10.929
Good.
Getting settled, you know.

07:10.961 --> 07:13.466
Ah, good, good.
Good.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.002
Just a second.

07:15.036 --> 07:18.509
Everybody, may I have
your attention please?

07:18.544 --> 07:21.550
I realize that a lot of you
have already heard

07:21.582 --> 07:23.352
that Martin here

07:23.386 --> 07:25.491
has had some trouble
with the law.

07:25.523 --> 07:27.695
But I just want
to declare publicly

07:27.727 --> 07:31.368
that I trust him
completely.

07:31.402 --> 07:34.240
And that anybody
who doesn't

07:34.274 --> 07:38.282
is an ignorant,
dumb person, okay?

07:38.315 --> 07:39.350
As a matter of fact,

07:39.384 --> 07:41.590
you show me a white man
you trust,

07:41.623 --> 07:44.028
and I will show you
a black man

07:44.061 --> 07:46.533
that I trust even more.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.537
Pam, tell me
a white person you trust.

07:48.570 --> 07:50.073
My dad.

07:50.107 --> 07:52.512
Danny Glover.

07:52.545 --> 07:55.282
Yeah?
Jonas Salk.

07:55.316 --> 07:57.286
Who?
Justin Timberlake.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.290
Oh, please.
Colin Powell.

07:59.324 --> 08:00.392
(Karen)
Hey, I got one.

08:00.426 --> 08:02.097
Yeah?
Jesus.

08:02.131 --> 08:04.168
Apollo Creed.

08:06.172 --> 08:07.474
Close your eyes.

08:07.508 --> 08:10.380
Picture a convict.

08:10.412 --> 08:12.384
What's he wearing?

08:12.416 --> 08:13.586
Nothing special.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.424
Baseball cap on backward,
baggy pants.

08:16.459 --> 08:18.395
He says something
ordinary like,

08:18.428 --> 08:20.568
"Yo, that's shizzle."

08:20.601 --> 08:24.340
Okay, now slowly
open your eyes again.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.444
Who were you picturing?

08:26.478 --> 08:28.348
A black man?

08:28.383 --> 08:29.450
Wrong.

08:29.484 --> 08:33.126
That was a white woman.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.564
Surprised?

08:35.598 --> 08:38.670
Well, shame on you.

08:38.704 --> 08:40.339
So, you all want to know
what I was in for?

08:40.372 --> 08:43.079
No, that's not cool.

08:43.113 --> 08:44.280
You don't
have to tell them.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.757
I really don't mind.
It was a stupid mistake.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.327
I was working in finance,

08:50.359 --> 08:53.133
and I got involved
in some insider trading.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.369
So I spent a little time

08:55.402 --> 08:57.107
in the clink.

08:57.141 --> 08:59.410
[laughs]
Oh!

08:59.444 --> 09:03.587
That is awesome.

09:03.619 --> 09:06.825
I had Martin explain to me
three times

09:06.860 --> 09:11.134
what he got arrested for,
because...

09:11.169 --> 09:13.138
it sounds an awful lot

09:13.173 --> 09:18.149
like I what I do here
every day.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.550
What was prison like?

09:19.585 --> 09:20.887
Not terrible.

09:20.921 --> 09:22.390
Boring.

09:22.424 --> 09:24.862
We do the same thing
every day.

09:24.895 --> 09:26.599
But at least
we'd get outdoors time.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.169
You got outdoors time?

09:28.203 --> 09:29.806
Two hours every day.

09:29.838 --> 09:32.177
Sometimes we'd play
pickup football games.

09:32.211 --> 09:34.581
Michael, why don't we get
outdoors time?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.484
Yeah, some days
I never go outside.

09:36.518 --> 09:38.223
Well, we are
running a business.

09:38.256 --> 09:39.390
What was your cell like?

09:39.425 --> 09:40.728
Not good.

09:40.761 --> 09:44.936
It was a little bit bigger
than Michael's office.

09:44.968 --> 09:47.406
But you know,
I really only slept there.

09:47.441 --> 09:50.948
You know, during the day
our time was our own.

09:50.980 --> 09:52.651
They had classes.

09:52.685 --> 09:54.455
I took some
watercolor classes.

09:54.487 --> 09:55.990
They have art classes?

09:56.023 --> 09:56.726
Yeah.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.929
They have business
classes there?

09:58.964 --> 10:01.201
They did, taught by some
Harvard Business School guys.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.873
A lot of the guys also
that were in the class--

10:03.907 --> 10:05.643
the inmates--

10:05.677 --> 10:06.679
a lot of them
have gone on to do

10:06.713 --> 10:07.881
extraordinary things
in business.
Terrible things.

10:07.915 --> 10:11.254
Kind of sounds like prison's
better than Dunder-Mifflin.

10:11.289 --> 10:13.425
Okay, well,
that's not true.

10:13.459 --> 10:15.329
I would so
rather be in prison.

10:15.362 --> 10:16.832
(Ryan)
Prison sounds great.

10:16.865 --> 10:18.303
No, you would not.

10:18.336 --> 10:19.605
This place is not prison.

10:19.638 --> 10:23.546
It's way better
than prison.

10:23.578 --> 10:25.449
Baby!

10:25.483 --> 10:26.619
Hello, baby!

10:26.652 --> 10:27.822
Here, you want to play
with this?

10:27.855 --> 10:28.990
You can't give
paperclips to a baby.

10:29.023 --> 10:30.660
He could swallow.

10:30.693 --> 10:32.497
Oh, it's okay.
I've got tons of 'em.

10:32.530 --> 10:34.936
You like that?
Goo goo goo goo?

10:34.969 --> 10:39.510
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong.

10:39.545 --> 10:40.981
Listen, you're cute.

10:41.013 --> 10:43.787
There's no getting
around it.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.325
So I don't know
if I like country music,

10:46.359 --> 10:47.962
but I was thinking
maybe one of these days

10:47.995 --> 10:49.365
we could drive out
to the fields,

10:49.398 --> 10:51.100
crank up some tunes.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.037
Smoke a few Macanudos.

10:53.072 --> 10:56.078
Maybe even toss
a disc around.

10:56.110 --> 10:59.017
Utway ooday ooyay
inkthay, Ampay?

10:59.049 --> 11:01.321
Wow. I--

11:01.321 --> 11:04.428
Shh!

11:04.461 --> 11:05.930
Think about it.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.566
I'll hit you back.

11:19.123 --> 11:20.928
Wow.

11:20.961 --> 11:24.601
That was...

11:24.634 --> 11:26.940
Wow.

11:26.973 --> 11:30.547
Okay, listen up,
everybody.

11:30.579 --> 11:34.956
Um, you guys said that prison
was better than this place.

11:34.989 --> 11:37.192
And I heard you
loud and clear.

11:37.225 --> 11:39.966
So I am instituting
some changes

11:39.999 --> 11:42.103
to make this
more like prison.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.773
We are going to start

11:43.806 --> 11:46.011
with an hour
of outdoor time.

11:46.044 --> 11:47.145
So let's go!

11:47.180 --> 11:50.453
[all shivering]

11:56.131 --> 11:57.100
Michael,
it's freezing out.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.736
I can't feel my toes.

11:58.769 --> 12:02.710
Why don't we
pump some iron?

12:02.745 --> 12:04.714
Anybody want to pump up?

12:04.748 --> 12:06.885
What is that,
like, five pounds?

12:06.919 --> 12:08.523
It's two and half.

12:08.555 --> 12:10.693
I'm not going for bulk.
I'm going for tone.

12:10.726 --> 12:11.895
I'm going back inside.
It's freezing.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.934
Yeah, it is freaking
cold out here.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.135
Anybody wants to stay out,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.172
you got about 27 minutes
of rec time.

12:20.245 --> 12:22.717
(Michael)
Oh, hey, Martin!

12:22.751 --> 12:25.121
You have TV in the joint?

12:25.156 --> 12:26.257
Yeah, in the rec room.

12:26.291 --> 12:28.763
Ah, got a ten-inch
black and white?

12:28.797 --> 12:30.933
Actually, our TV was
bigger than that one.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.937
[snickering]

12:32.971 --> 12:35.778
(Michael)
These people do realize
how lucky they are.

12:35.810 --> 12:39.150
This office is
the American Dream.

12:39.184 --> 12:42.190
And they would rather
be in the hole.

12:43.659 --> 12:45.697
Oh, Andy.

12:45.730 --> 12:48.001
I thought of one last tack
you can take with Pam.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.306
Yeah, what?
Quick question.
Do you play the guitar?

12:50.338 --> 12:51.340
I play the banjo.

12:51.373 --> 12:52.911
Hold on.
Let me think about that.

12:52.944 --> 12:54.279
Yes, that'll work.

12:54.314 --> 12:56.985
But can you sing in a sexy
high falsetto voice?

13:00.259 --> 13:02.731
[falsetto]
* You know I can, my man *

13:02.763 --> 13:03.732
Yep, that's perfect.

13:03.766 --> 13:06.204
Hey.
Hey.

13:06.237 --> 13:07.740
I'm gonna go get
my banjo out of my car.

13:07.774 --> 13:08.977
Perfect.

13:09.009 --> 13:11.381
What is going on?

13:11.414 --> 13:13.251
I'm messing with Andy.

13:13.284 --> 13:14.855
I'm sending him to all
the women in the office

13:14.889 --> 13:17.393
with just
terrible information

13:17.426 --> 13:18.929
on how to get them
to go out with him.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.365
I love it.
I want in.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.237
Who's the target?

13:23.272 --> 13:25.710
Oh, you know what?

13:25.742 --> 13:27.714
It was gonna be Pam, but--
Perfect.

13:27.746 --> 13:29.383
What do I do?
Just give me an assignment.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.923
Oh, you know what,
though?

13:31.955 --> 13:34.227
I feel like I already
sicced him on Pam.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.361
We'll give her a break.

13:35.396 --> 13:38.001
Let's think
of someone else.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.137
All right, everybody.

13:39.170 --> 13:41.107
There has been
a lot of name-calling

13:41.141 --> 13:42.442
against our office today.

13:42.475 --> 13:45.448
Corporate maligning,
slurring.

13:45.481 --> 13:48.857
Much of it coming
from one of you

13:48.889 --> 13:53.064
who claims that
prison is better

13:53.097 --> 13:54.466
than here.

13:54.499 --> 13:57.173
And none of us
can say "boo"

13:57.206 --> 14:00.179
because none of us
have ever been to prison.

14:00.212 --> 14:03.318
Well, here's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

14:03.352 --> 14:06.791
Somebody else who has
been to prison

14:06.825 --> 14:08.294
who can tell you what

14:08.328 --> 14:12.036
it is really like.

14:12.070 --> 14:15.442
[bad New York City accent]
I'm Prison Mike.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.846
You know why they call me
Prison Mike?

14:17.882 --> 14:19.284
Do you really expect us to
believe you're somebody else?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.153
Do you really expect me

14:21.187 --> 14:23.424
to not push you up against
the wall, beeyotch?

14:23.458 --> 14:25.396
Hey!
Whoa, whoa!

14:25.428 --> 14:28.201
Hey, that's just the way
we talk in the clink.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.007
Been a lot of fun talk
about prison today.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.144
But I am here
to scare you straight.

14:34.882 --> 14:38.989
I am here
to scare you straight!

14:39.024 --> 14:41.795
In prison, you are
somebody's bitch.

14:41.829 --> 14:43.332
Oh, and you.

14:43.365 --> 14:45.135
You, my friend, would be

14:45.168 --> 14:47.105
da belle of da ball.

14:47.139 --> 14:49.477
Don't drop the soap.
Don't drop the soap.

14:49.509 --> 14:50.346
Michael, please.

14:50.379 --> 14:52.918
[kissing noises]

14:52.952 --> 14:54.956
Where did you learn
all of this?

14:54.989 --> 14:56.123
Internet.

14:56.157 --> 14:57.159
So not prison.

14:57.192 --> 15:00.098
And prison.
It's 50/50.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.434
Both.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.438
Look, prison stinks

15:03.472 --> 15:04.473
is what I'm saying.

15:04.507 --> 15:06.243
It's not like
you can go home

15:06.277 --> 15:07.981
and recharge your batteries

15:08.015 --> 15:09.283
and come back in the morning

15:09.317 --> 15:12.022
and be with your friends
having fun in the office.

15:13.524 --> 15:15.196
What did you do,
Prison Mike?

15:15.229 --> 15:18.402
I stole.

15:18.435 --> 15:20.907
And I robbed.

15:20.941 --> 15:24.380
And I kidnapped
the President's son

15:24.414 --> 15:26.050
and held him for ransom.

15:26.084 --> 15:28.923
That is quite
the rap sheet, Prison Mike.

15:28.957 --> 15:30.459
An I never got caught
neither.

15:30.491 --> 15:32.965
Well, you're in prison,
but, mm-hmm.

15:32.997 --> 15:35.469
Prison Mike, what was
the food like in prison?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.475
Gruel sandwiches.

15:38.508 --> 15:39.577
Gruel omelets.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.414
Nothing but gruel.

15:41.448 --> 15:43.184
Plus, you can eat
your own hair.

15:43.217 --> 15:44.956
Wow.

15:44.989 --> 15:46.290
Prison sounds horrible.

15:46.323 --> 15:48.194
Yeah, yeah.

15:48.227 --> 15:50.365
Well, thank you, Andy.
Thanks.

15:50.399 --> 15:52.470
Prison Mike,
what's the very, very

15:52.503 --> 15:54.273
worst thing about prison?

15:54.306 --> 15:56.310
[muttering]
Don't encourage him,
Dwight.

15:56.343 --> 15:59.484
The worst thing about prison
was--was the Dementors.

15:59.517 --> 16:01.720
They were flying
all over the place,

16:01.753 --> 16:03.558
and they were scary.

16:03.592 --> 16:04.627
And then they'd come down
and they'd suck the soul

16:04.660 --> 16:06.198
out of your body,
and it hurt.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.665
Dementors like
in Harry Potter?

16:07.700 --> 16:10.506
No, not Harry Potter.

16:10.538 --> 16:12.510
There were no movies
in prison.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.278
This is my point.

16:13.312 --> 16:16.383
You guys got it soft
and cushy.

16:16.418 --> 16:18.055
This place is
freaking awesome.

16:18.087 --> 16:19.557
The people are awesome.

16:19.589 --> 16:20.358
Your boss is nice.

16:20.391 --> 16:22.429
Everybody seems
to get along.

16:22.463 --> 16:24.433
People are tolerant.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.338
People who would jump
to conclusions

16:26.370 --> 16:27.706
can redeem themselves.

16:27.739 --> 16:30.279
Nobody's nobody's bitch.

16:30.311 --> 16:32.182
I hope that this scared you.

16:32.216 --> 16:34.520
And from me, Prison Mike,
to you,

16:34.554 --> 16:38.128
I just want to thank you
for listening to me.

16:38.162 --> 16:41.134
And letting me be a part
of your life today.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.406
'Cause you got
a good life!

16:44.439 --> 16:45.576
You got a good life.

16:45.609 --> 16:48.347
A good life.

16:53.824 --> 16:56.298
So, what do you think?

16:56.330 --> 16:58.135
It doesn't sound so great,
does it?

16:58.168 --> 17:01.074
Wow.

17:01.108 --> 17:02.042
Thank you.

17:02.042 --> 17:05.581
Um, that must have been hard
for you to relive that.

17:05.616 --> 17:07.152
Both of you.

17:07.186 --> 17:09.757
Yeah, that wasn't really

17:09.789 --> 17:11.660
at all my experience.

17:11.693 --> 17:13.597
There were
certain elements

17:13.632 --> 17:15.569
of what you performed

17:15.601 --> 17:17.640
I've seen on television,

17:17.672 --> 17:20.545
but it didn't remind me
of my time in prison.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.788
Okay, okay.
Fine.

17:25.822 --> 17:28.162
You guys think prison
is so great?

17:28.195 --> 17:30.266
All right.

17:30.298 --> 17:33.405
Well, here you go.

17:33.437 --> 17:35.341
(Jim)
Okay, Michael.
Come on, let us out.

17:35.376 --> 17:37.746
No, if you think prison
is so wonderful,

17:37.780 --> 17:39.284
then enjoy prison.

17:39.317 --> 17:40.652
Are we locked in here?

17:40.686 --> 17:42.522
They are such babies.

17:42.555 --> 17:44.426
I am going to
leave them in there

17:44.459 --> 17:46.631
until they can
appreciate what it's like

17:46.664 --> 17:48.601
to have freedom.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.272
And if this doesn't
bother them,

17:50.306 --> 17:51.841
then I am out of ideas.

17:51.873 --> 17:54.180
[continuous knocking on door]

17:54.214 --> 17:56.383
[Hannah humming lullaby]

17:56.418 --> 17:58.822
Hey!
Let us out of here!

17:58.855 --> 18:01.661
[loud pounding]

18:01.694 --> 18:04.966
Hey, I have--
Shh!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.871
[ring]

18:09.609 --> 18:11.581
This is Toby.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.351
Hey, Pam.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.719
Where are you
calling from?

18:17.625 --> 18:19.963
Michael, why is everyone
locked in the conference room?

18:19.997 --> 18:23.471
They were very disrespectful
to me and to the office.

18:23.505 --> 18:26.578
And Martin has had
a bad influence.

18:26.610 --> 18:29.549
To think that I gave him
the benefit of a doubt.

18:29.584 --> 18:30.651
It's--

18:30.685 --> 18:34.360
Well, you're gonna have to
let them out or I will.

18:34.394 --> 18:36.597
Okay, you know what, Toby?

18:36.630 --> 18:40.605
I am teaching them
a lesson, so...

18:40.638 --> 18:42.743
You know
they're teasing you.

18:42.776 --> 18:45.749
I mean, obviously this is

18:45.782 --> 18:50.056
a much nicer place
than an actual prison.

18:50.089 --> 18:51.794
We get paid to be here.

18:51.828 --> 18:54.032
We go home afterwards
and have social lives.

18:54.064 --> 18:57.272
And we have parties here.

18:59.643 --> 19:01.613
They're teasing you.

19:01.647 --> 19:02.282
To be funny.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.772
Okay, nutcases,
get out of there.

19:13.805 --> 19:15.642
Good work.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.912
Long day.
Really long.

19:17.945 --> 19:21.052
Why don't you guys
head home early?

19:21.085 --> 19:23.657
Time off
for good behavior!

19:23.692 --> 19:25.696
[chuckles]

19:25.728 --> 19:27.799
Good job.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.004
Enjoy your freedoms.

19:34.779 --> 19:39.589
Martin went from being
a new guy from Stamford

19:39.624 --> 19:41.727
to a convict,

19:41.760 --> 19:44.599
to my friend,

19:44.634 --> 19:46.803
back to a convict,

19:46.837 --> 19:49.609
then to kind of
a nuisance, actually,

19:49.644 --> 19:51.813
if we can be
completely honest.

19:51.847 --> 19:55.721
And finally to a quitter.

19:55.755 --> 19:58.060
And I will not miss him.

19:58.093 --> 20:02.402
And that is not
because he is black.

20:04.474 --> 20:05.609
[falsetto voice]
* So we've been told

20:05.642 --> 20:08.113
* And some choose
to believe it *

20:08.145 --> 20:13.089
* I know they're wrong,
wait and see *

20:13.122 --> 20:15.896
* 'Cause one day
we'll find it *

20:15.929 --> 20:18.867
* The ainbowray
onnectionkay *

20:18.901 --> 20:23.110
