00:01.440 --> 00:05.399
<i>I'm not sick, but I'm not well</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:08.432
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:08.480 --> 00:12.996
<i>Cos I'm in hell.</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:22.432
Hi, Alan, you wanted to talk about...
Oh, I'm sorry...

00:22.480 --> 00:25.631
It's just Tai Chi. Take a seat,
I'll just power through.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.758
It should take 45 minutes,
I'm done in ten.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.074
Stick that up your dojo.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.155
Great.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.988
Right, this weekend,
the JLB conference in Kettering.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.157
I'm planning to unleash Project Zeus.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.474
Project Zeus?

00:43.520 --> 00:47.718
You will not be informed of the meaning
until the time is right.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.751
Oh, right.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.313
'I like it when he's rude to me.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.716
'Hopefully, it's a psychological defect,
not a weird sexual thing.'

00:54.760 --> 00:57.957
OK, now is the time for you to know
the meaning of Project Zeus.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.710
The meaning of Project Zeus is,
why can't Marketing be an arm of Sales?

01:02.760 --> 01:04.590
I don't know, Alan.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.633
Thousands of reasons,
but also, kind of none.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.274
But won't Marketing kick up a shit-storm?

01:11.320 --> 01:15.791
That's why I've booked you and me in
for a presentation to the board.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.876
I'll leave the details up to you.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.469
But if you persuade them,
we co-manage a new super-department.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.114
If we fail, you're junior,
you take the bullet.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.720
- Christ.
- Exactly!

01:26.760 --> 01:30.719
So, you're going to need a team.
I'll assign you some slave drones.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.239
Milk them till they're dead.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.511
We need them sweating facts
and shitting stats till D-Day. OK...

01:35.560 --> 01:36.834
OK.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.078
If we succeed, I'm going to be Charles
and you'll be my Camilla.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.430
'I'm going to be Johnson's queen.
If the public will accept me,

01:44.480 --> 01:47.040
'I'm going to be Johnson's queen.'

01:48.480 --> 01:52.189
'My team! I'm going to be
the most amazing boss ever.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.151
'I'll have them eating
out of my hand

01:54.200 --> 01:57.112
'while I squeeze them by the balls.'

01:57.160 --> 01:58.275
Are you all right?

01:58.320 --> 02:02.029
Yes, it's fine. Just monitoring
stomach-acid levels.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.593
'That's not businesslike.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.710
'It's not even a proper disability.'

02:08.360 --> 02:12.592
Right, well, thanks, guys, for coming
to the first get-together

02:12.640 --> 02:14.596
of the Project Zeus work group.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.200
First up, remember,
this is a brainstorm.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.152
I'm not judging.
It's an ideas party,

02:20.200 --> 02:23.715
so before we start the pitter-patter
of grey matter...

02:23.760 --> 02:25.990
'That is a brilliant jokette.'

02:26.040 --> 02:27.314
<i>... I'll go get the pizzas.</i>

02:27.360 --> 02:29.920
'Hot, cheesy pizza
to max out your stomach acid.'

02:29.960 --> 02:31.154
How's it going?

02:31.200 --> 02:33.998
I was telling them it doesn't matter
what they say tonight,

02:34.040 --> 02:36.998
when, actually, I'll be keeping
a rigorous note of every contribution.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.395
Jeremy, have you been
eating my pizza?

02:39.440 --> 02:41.670
Big Suze was hungry. She's rich.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.950
She doesn't understand
about not taking people's stuff.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.558
DOORBELL

02:45.600 --> 02:47.875
Can you get that please, Jeremy?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.989
- Jeremy.
- Johnson.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.554
'Oh, I've got a sweater
around my shoulders.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.070
'I'm not a corporate cocksucker,
I'm a human being. Sure.'

03:00.120 --> 03:01.235
Sorry.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.599
No apology required.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.392
SHE GIGGLES

03:05.600 --> 03:07.318
- (Mark) Alan!
- Hi, guys.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.509
(AIl) Hi.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.030
Just wanted to say, "Have fun."
Tonight should be an idea zone.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.799
Watch a DVD, eat some pizza,
fuck each other.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.196
I'm serious. Fuck a chicken,
if that's what it takes.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.071
Watch a chicken fucking a horse.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.918
What? You think the guys who invented
Google watched Trumpton?

03:22.960 --> 03:26.839
'Oh, he is good. Taboo-busting,
semi-incomprehensible pep talk.'

03:26.880 --> 03:28.711
Hi there, can I come in?

03:28.760 --> 03:30.193
Uh... no.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.755
Nice room. Here, have a drink.

03:33.800 --> 03:38.794
So... that's a great piece of
real estate you got there.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.751
A mighty fine piece of ass.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.472
What, Big Suze?

03:42.520 --> 03:45.353
In business, Jeremy,
every man has his price,

03:45.400 --> 03:47.834
and I judge yours to be £530.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.156
- What?
- I'm not going to beat around the bush.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.078
I want to make you
a real-life indecent proposal.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.634
An indecent proposal?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.193
I want to sleep with your girlfriend, Jeremy,

03:58.240 --> 04:02.472
but I don't like playing the game
with women, talking to them,

04:02.520 --> 04:06.559
but I do like some of the things
they do, so...

04:06.600 --> 04:09.956
£530 to sleep with Big Suze?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.230
That's my indecent proposal.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.157
It certainly is.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.873
You have a property
of which I wish to make a use.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.480
Is that so very different
from hiring a solicitor

04:19.519 --> 04:20.793
or leasing a Spanish villa?

04:20.839 --> 04:23.195
It is, because you'd be
putting your dick...

04:23.240 --> 04:24.878
What's your answer, Jeremy?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.990
Maybe you could finger her for 300.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.837
I'm not bargaining with you.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.237
'He thinks I'm a scag addict
bedroom DJ who can be bought off,

04:33.280 --> 04:37.558
'but no-one's going to give me
a medal for saying no. I am broke.'

04:37.600 --> 04:39.318
OK, it's a deal.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.035
'Is this a terrible idea?
It can't be, it's in a film.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.799
'They wouldn't put a terrible idea
in a film. They'd get sued.'

04:47.440 --> 04:50.113
So, finance, logistics, etc.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.073
These are the key tasks for you
to get done for my presentation.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.430
I want you to have fun with these.
Don't sweat it, go mental.

04:57.480 --> 05:00.631
But then go sane again
and check and recheck,

05:00.680 --> 05:02.955
cos I'll be the guy pitching
this stuff. OK?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.672
And how do you think we should be?

05:04.720 --> 05:06.676
'Tube up his nose,
man with a tube up his nose! '

05:06.720 --> 05:08.472
<i>...funding implications?</i>

05:08.520 --> 05:11.637
Yep, just relax
and take your time, OK?

05:11.680 --> 05:12.999
OK.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.596
'Shit.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.234
'This could be a tricky sell.'

05:19.280 --> 05:23.034
Say, Suze, do you like
the films of Robert Redford?

05:23.080 --> 05:24.229
I don't know. Who is he?

05:24.280 --> 05:27.511
He's a red-haired old gentleman

05:27.560 --> 05:30.472
and he started
the Sundance Film Festival.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.635
Sounds like a nice man.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.318
Exactly!

05:33.360 --> 05:37.433
So, in that spirit,
I was wondering, basically,

05:37.480 --> 05:42.270
how would you feel about sleeping
with Mark's boss, for money?

05:42.320 --> 05:44.709
Sleep with a man? For money?

05:44.760 --> 05:48.196
Yes, but it's not like that,
it's from a Hollywood film.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.071
Sounds like
you want to pimp me out.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.351
Pimp me out, Pimp My Ride -
there's a new climate.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.311
I'm a human being, Jeremy.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.238
Yes, sure.
From one perspective.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.192
But also, is it really so different

06:01.240 --> 06:04.789
from hiring a solicitor
or leasing a villa in Spain?

06:04.840 --> 06:07.718
I can't believe this, Jeremy.
This is really horrible.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.830
No, look, Suze. Sorry.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.474
I love you.
I've just got this big overdraft.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.830
I take it all back. There.
Normal! We're back to normal.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.394
No, we're not.
You tried to make me a hooker.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.998
It was a joke, Suze.
I'm hitting the reset button.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.838
- Goodbye, Jeremy.
- Don't go.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.108
'God, I only asked her to be a hooker.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.072
'It's not like I wanted her
to work in telesales.'

06:28.760 --> 06:32.230
'Er, Kettering. Got to force
Sales and Marketing together

06:32.280 --> 06:35.636
'with my bare hands
and this bunch of mooks.'

06:35.680 --> 06:39.753
Johnson will be here around three,
so I want to pull together your work

06:39.800 --> 06:42.189
ahead of the big
presentation tomorrow.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.312
What have you got? Have you got
the logistics figures, Lisa?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.874
The finance projections, Katie? Jeff?

06:47.920 --> 06:51.754
We chatted, and you said, "Relax
and take your time", so we thought,

06:51.800 --> 06:54.678
before we started,
there are a few questions...

06:54.720 --> 06:58.076
You're kidding? You've got... nothing?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.429
You did say,
"Relax and take your time."

07:00.480 --> 07:03.995
I didn't actually mean,
"Relax and take your time." Jesus!

07:04.040 --> 07:07.430
I'm giving the presentation tomorrow.
Johnson is here at three.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.993
My balls are on the line here.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.270
We could form
a couple of workgroups...

07:11.320 --> 07:14.118
I don't care how you do it
as long as you fucking well do it!

07:14.160 --> 07:17.357
- OK.
- Listen, I did have a little look,

07:17.400 --> 07:19.516
and one of the concepts I came up with

07:19.560 --> 07:22.028
was not just amalgamating
Sales and Marketing,

07:22.080 --> 07:23.638
but also putting Planning into the mix,

07:23.680 --> 07:27.673
to see if, with one big department, we can't...

07:27.720 --> 07:31.156
That sounds interesting.
Why don't I take that?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.668
I'm going to the loo.
I can have a look at it

07:33.720 --> 07:36.393
and I can then
wipe my fucking arse on it.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.510
If integrating two departments
is a nightmare,

07:38.560 --> 07:41.836
how exactly is pulling a third in
going to help? You dick pole!

07:43.640 --> 07:47.076
'Here we go, Big Suze's place.
If she won't take my calls,

07:47.120 --> 07:50.192
'how about I hit her with
some petrol station flowers? '

07:52.080 --> 07:53.513
Johnson!

07:53.560 --> 07:55.630
- Jeremy.
- What the hell are?

07:55.680 --> 07:58.319
Suze came to the office
to give me a piece of her mind,

07:58.360 --> 08:01.193
and ended up
giving me a piece of her ass.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.471
- Suze, what's he doing here?
- We're in a relationship, Jez.

08:04.520 --> 08:08.035
- What do you mean?
- It's fun. We eat breakfast off each other.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.479
Come on, let's get moving.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.193
It's two hours to Kettering,
even in a Beemer.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.073
'He didn't even pay for her.'

08:15.120 --> 08:17.031
He's an alpha male, Jeremy.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.958
And you'd be the first to admit
you're a bottom-feeder.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.115
No, I wouldn't.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.470
You can't treat me like this,
Johnson. You owe me.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.397
I'll take this to
the Citizens Advice Bureau.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.149
How do you like those guys
on your ass? I don't give up, Alan!

08:31.800 --> 08:36.828
So, we've all been talking,
me and Lisa and Katie and Jeff,

08:36.880 --> 08:40.429
and we think we'd like to
step down from the workgroup.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.914
But... you can't.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.871
- You said it was voluntary.
- It's not.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.434
I was shocked
when you called Kathy a knucklehead.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.550
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.831
You said she should knuckle down
or you'd knuckle her fat head.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.393
Then you stamped on Gerrard's foot.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.112
- That was an accident.
- It wasn't.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.948
It could have been. I was careful
to be sure that it could have been.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.073
Come on, Soph. You want us to enjoy
the executive lifestyle together.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.269
<i>I was nice to you,</i>

09:05.320 --> 09:08.118
even when you gave me shit about
the earnings projections.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.549
That's not how you should treat people.
You should be nice.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.830
'Oh, sure. It's nice to be nice.'

09:12.880 --> 09:14.677
Shall we go get some dinner?

09:14.720 --> 09:19.111
'Have your fancy dinner, till the bill
comes and the bodies pile up.'

09:19.160 --> 09:21.071
Come in.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.477
Fine. I guess it's just Gerrard and me
from here on in. Right, Gerrard?

09:25.520 --> 09:27.033
Sorry?

09:27.080 --> 09:30.072
I said, it's just you and me
from here on in. Right?

09:30.120 --> 09:31.872
Right, sorry.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.229
I've got a mucus build-up in my ears...

09:34.280 --> 09:35.554
< See you later, then.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.717
Cool. Cool, dude. Sit down.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.911
Clear your tubes, cos you and me
are going to chow down

09:41.960 --> 09:45.669
on the biggest hairy motherfucking
business shit-storm since Enron.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.589
'Sales, Marketing, Marketing, Sales.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.791
'AII I'm doing is scrolling up
and down this useless document,

09:53.840 --> 09:55.831
'inserting words, almost at random.'

09:55.880 --> 09:57.791
KNOCK AT DOOR

09:57.840 --> 10:00.308
'I can roll Gerrard out
for the sympathy vote.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.750
'He's my dark secret,
my elephant man.'

10:05.200 --> 10:07.509
Hey-hey, it's me. Surprise visit.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.994
I can see it's you.
What the hell are you doing here?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.838
I'm here to party, man.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.235
You're following Johnson
and Big Suze!

10:15.280 --> 10:19.478
- You're going to do something disruptive.
- No, no, God, no... Maybe.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.239
I need to find Big Suze.
There's no answer at her room.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.158
Why do you want to get back
with her? She was annoying you.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.428
That was before we stopped going out.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.597
So now she's finished with you,
you're in love with her again?

10:29.640 --> 10:32.359
Exactly. D'oh!
That's how love works, Mark.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.879
(Johnson) Hi, it's Charles.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.114
Johnson.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.593
(Johnson) Is that Camilla?

10:36.640 --> 10:38.835
Yeah, this is Camilla.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.518
'God, that's so humiliating.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.233
'Why couldn't we be Holmes and Watson,
or Ben and Jerry?

10:43.280 --> 10:47.910
'Even Bernie Winters and Schnorbitz
would've been an improvement.'

10:47.960 --> 10:49.757
So, how's Project Zeus coming along?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.074
'Oh, shit.'

10:51.120 --> 10:53.270
It's going really well, actually.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.833
I think I've cracked it, Alan.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.714
Cool. So let's roll out somewhere
spicy and celebrate.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.479
Sales is going to get
shit-faced with Marketing.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.115
Although there are actually
a few pesky I's to dot

11:05.160 --> 11:07.196
and a few T's
for me and Gerrard to...

11:07.240 --> 11:09.879
- Just bring your laptop along, dude.
- But, Alan...

11:09.920 --> 11:12.195
Mark, if you say it's done, it's done.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.118
Come on, Mark. Let's get wankered.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.390
Yeah, seriously cunted.

11:17.440 --> 11:22.912
'Great. I'm going out with literally
the worst men in the world! '

11:25.800 --> 11:27.153
Hey, Suze.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.112
Jeremy, what the hell are you doing here?

11:30.160 --> 11:31.673
Me? Nothing.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.393
I was just passing through...
Kettering and I thought,

11:34.440 --> 11:36.635
"Hey, I know someone who's gone
to Kettering for the weekend."

11:36.680 --> 11:37.829
Jez...

11:37.880 --> 11:42.271
Honestly, I was always coming
to Kettering. It's a party town.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.197
Come on, Suze.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.708
Let's sort this.
What do you see in Johnson?

11:46.760 --> 11:50.389
- I just like him.
- Come on, is it because he's black?

11:50.440 --> 11:51.953
What? No!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.991
I hadn't even noticed.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.395
Well, you're making a mistake, Suze.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.874
Because he's terrible at being black.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.751
I'm a better black man than he is.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.119
That sounds almost...

12:02.160 --> 12:05.709
Look, Suze, being black
isn't about the colour of your skin.

12:05.760 --> 12:09.309
It's about vibe, about kicking back,
smoking a number,

12:09.360 --> 12:13.319
fighting prejudice and negative stereotypes
wherever you find them!

12:13.360 --> 12:17.911
I'm down with that. What's Johnson
done for black people lately?

12:17.960 --> 12:21.350
You mean, apart from his mentoring
and his community work?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.992
Yeah, apart from that.

12:23.040 --> 12:28.034
Jeremy, you tried to sell my body
to another man for private gain.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.310
I don't want to talk to you. Goodbye.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.191
SHE SIGHS

12:32.240 --> 12:35.550
I did not try to sell her body
to another man.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.674
I tried to rent out her
sexual organs on a one-use basis.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.358
SHE SIGHS

12:45.400 --> 12:48.278
I've always wanted to come
somewhere like this.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.632
I love the funny women taking their
clothes off, and you lot gawping.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.956
Wasn't the last one a bit... thin?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.275
Relax, Mark. We're relaxing.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.834
You don't want a fat lap dancer, do you?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.156
'Oh, my God, this is horrible.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.918
'Oh, she's touching the tube.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.110
'That can't be hygienic.'

13:08.160 --> 13:10.879
How's it looking, Mark?
Looking good, right?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.514
Oh, it is looking so good, Alan.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.913
'Maybe I can work in a back room.
There must be a back room somewhere

13:18.960 --> 13:22.509
'that isn't full of mobsters
or sallow men getting wanked.'

13:22.560 --> 13:24.312
(Big Suze) I'm going to get you a dance.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.955
That's what I'm going to do, Mark.
That's what you need.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.312
No, Suze, I really don't think
l-l-I really have time,

13:32.360 --> 13:33.793
and Soph, and everything.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.115
An early wedding present.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.912
Hello, you, yes you.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.111
Would you do one to him, please?
Thanks.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.196
- Suze, I really...
- Shh.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.912
'I'm being forced into this.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.678
'That's the line.'

13:46.720 --> 13:48.039
Hi, and what's your name?

13:48.080 --> 13:50.355
Mar-tin.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.073
Nice to meet you, Martin.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.350
'Oh, great. Here we go.

13:55.400 --> 14:00.679
'I'm just another cock getting wired
into the global economy.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.358
'Yeugh, how should I look like?

14:02.400 --> 14:06.791
'Bond-like neutrality, as though I'm
so used to real-life naked women?

14:06.840 --> 14:11.391
'Or - don't want to be rude -
smiling encouragement?

14:11.440 --> 14:15.991
'That's not a leer, is it? Got to
avoid the leer. And the dribble.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.918
'Oh, God, she looks amazing.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.871
'This really should not be allowed.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.037
'This is what men want and we
shouldn't be allowed to have it

14:24.080 --> 14:27.595
'because it's horrible and it
makes you feel sick. Oh, great.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.437
'Now I'm getting an erection.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.392
'How grimly predictable.
When is the work going to happen? '

14:32.440 --> 14:34.078
I'm very sorry

14:34.120 --> 14:37.954
and you're a very attractive woman,
but I have a helluva lot on, so...

14:38.000 --> 14:40.912
- Do you want me to stop?
- No, no, no, you go ahead.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.430
You're obviously very talented
but I should just get on with this.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.677
- What are you writing?
- Just a proposal, so...

14:47.720 --> 14:49.995
You haven't written very much,
have you?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.156
You should sum up your aims
in the first line.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.589
This is a very complex
business proposal,

14:54.640 --> 14:57.632
so I don't think you could sum up
all the aims in one line.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.558
If you can't sum up your aims
in the first line, they're too diffuse.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.160
My aims are not
too fucking diffuse, OK?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.475
Fine. Jesus!

15:05.520 --> 15:09.069
They just might be too diffuse,
that was all I was saying.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.079
'Great, now I'm getting
an angry lap dance. Brilliant.'

15:13.120 --> 15:15.554
Hi, Mark, how are you feeling?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.079
Relaxed.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.509
l-I feel really very relaxed.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.552
So you didn't fancy
a night out with the team?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.431
They were going to
a lap dancing place.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.436
Really? God.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.277
Men!

15:34.320 --> 15:35.309
Do you wanna?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.918
I should keep a clear head.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.872
Go on. Before we get your booty
locked up by Captain Corrigan.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.833
'She's so cool and nice. How did
Mark get anything going with her?

15:43.880 --> 15:45.791
'She must have some
massive character defect

15:45.840 --> 15:48.229
'that only becomes apparent
after a while.'

15:48.280 --> 15:49.679
So how's it going with Big Suze?

15:49.720 --> 15:52.109
Oh, pretty terrible.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.628
I came to try and win her back
but I don't even know if I like her or...

15:54.680 --> 15:57.558
I sometimes wonder what I'm doing
with Mark. Getting married.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.795
I mean, whether he's really into me.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.957
Have I lived enough. I've only slept
with four men. Is that enough?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.798
Four? Oh, yeah.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.831
'Jesus, I've had sex
with more men than that

16:07.880 --> 16:09.916
'and I basically only sleep with women.'

16:09.960 --> 16:13.794
You might slip another one or two in
just to get your average up.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.115
I don't know if I'm attractive enough to.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.993
You're attractive.
You're a hottie, Soph. You're hot.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.999
Oh, that's nice. Thanks, Jez.
You're pretty hot, too.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.476
Well... here's to being hot.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.112
'Shit, is this going to happen?

16:28.160 --> 16:30.390
'This is almost definitely a terrible idea.

16:30.440 --> 16:35.230
'But I won't know for certain
until I've actually done it.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.308
'No, I was right, that was a terrible idea.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.352
'That's probably the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.188
'AIthough maybe screwing each other
will make it weirdly better.'

16:46.240 --> 16:47.514
DOOR OPENS

16:47.560 --> 16:49.152
Hey, Markie!

16:49.200 --> 16:53.751
Hello, just need to grab some files,
and some ProPlus and Nurofen.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.314
I'm pulling an all-nighter with Gerrard.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.873
Cool. Well, I'll probably head off.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.992
You know, get some sleep
in the utility area.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.396
Yeah? Will you be OK?
There's always the bathroom floor.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.351
Er, no, mate, no, no.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.039
I'm fine in the utility area, got it all set up.

17:09.079 --> 17:12.470
Couple of bog rolls for a pillow
and a wicked big tarpaulin.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.351
Good, that sounds nice.

17:17.160 --> 17:20.470
You're a bloody good guy.
You're a great guy. Isn't he a good guy?

17:20.520 --> 17:23.397
Oh, you're a great guy.
You're a fucking great guy.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.317
'Why are they being so nice?

17:25.359 --> 17:27.920
'Maybe they've been
having a chat about me

17:27.960 --> 17:30.235
'and they've realised
I was right about North Korea,

17:30.280 --> 17:32.236
'and about the European constitution,

17:32.280 --> 17:35.556
'and by God, I think I'm right
about the congestion charge.'

17:38.320 --> 17:42.791
'Oh, my God, I feel terrible.
I feel like my head's going to explode.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.310
'Relax, Mark, heads don't explode.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.874
'It's much more likely
you'll just get a tumour.'

17:48.920 --> 17:52.356
So half an hour till the board roll in
and I pitch this mother.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.153
This is it, it's just you and me
from here on in.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.237
- Sorry?
- I said it's just you and me from...

17:58.280 --> 17:59.918
Right. Sorry, yes.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.520
It's the mucus this side.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.836
Yes, of course.
OK, so final analysis,

18:05.880 --> 18:08.519
what have we actually got?
What will I present to the board?

18:10.080 --> 18:14.358
Not that. That sounded good at 3am
when we were high on Diet Coke.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.152
That's bullshit.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.796
That's just table talk,
that's not fit for public consumption.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.673
Is that it?
Where's the actual sustenance?

18:23.720 --> 18:26.837
Where's the beef?
Gerrard, we've got...

18:26.880 --> 18:29.030
There's nothing.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.992
I've got nothing.
I've got fucking nothing here.

18:32.040 --> 18:36.113
We haven't got anything.
We've spent all night doing...

18:36.160 --> 18:38.196
nothing, Gerrard, you prick!

18:38.240 --> 18:40.708
I've been working very hard trying to...

18:40.760 --> 18:43.320
You cocksucker!
You bullshit, wanker!

18:43.360 --> 18:47.239
That's enough, Mark, all right?
You can't talk to me like that!

18:47.280 --> 18:53.037
'I've lost my elephant man.
My beautiful elephant man.'

18:53.080 --> 18:56.470
How's it going, mate?
Everyone's excited.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.750
Jeff...

18:58.800 --> 19:01.872
Jeff... Listen, Jeff, your idea.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.390
Have you still got the printout of the idea,
the three-department merger?

19:05.440 --> 19:07.032
The one you wiped your arse on?

19:07.080 --> 19:11.915
Yeah. That wasn't actually that funny,
was it? Have you got a copy?

19:11.960 --> 19:14.599
Yeah, sure, mate.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.675
Here it is.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.514
'I feel so bad about betraying Mark.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.676
'Still another snog for Jez's snog book.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.156
'Hmm, he looks terrible.
Looks like he could do with a friend.'

19:31.200 --> 19:32.553
Mark?

19:32.600 --> 19:36.673
'God, I really hope
I don't still smell of Sophie.'

19:36.720 --> 19:38.711
What's on the piece of paper, Mark?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.909
What?

19:39.960 --> 19:43.077
Has something on that piece of paper
made you sad?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.588
You know what this piece of paper
says, Jeremy?

19:47.880 --> 19:50.189
Is it something to do with history?

19:50.240 --> 19:52.231
Have they stopped history books?

19:52.280 --> 19:55.477
This piece of paper says that I am fucked.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.431
Oh, that's horrible. Who sent you that?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.994
It's my plan for Project Zeus.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.519
Let's have a look.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.230
That's what I've got to
go through that door

20:08.280 --> 20:13.434
- and pitch to the JLB board in ten minutes.
- Shit.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.677
I'm about to walk into a boardroom gangbang

20:16.720 --> 20:19.109
and get fucked by the biggest swinging dicks

20:19.160 --> 20:20.878
in corporate strategy.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.672
Maybe you should run away.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.199
Right, thanks, Jez.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.912
People say it like it's a bad thing,

20:25.960 --> 20:27.359
running away from your problems,

20:27.400 --> 20:30.119
but if they never catch up with you,
what's the hitch?

20:30.160 --> 20:33.516
In this case
there would be repercussions.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.471
What do you care? You'd be in the woods

20:35.520 --> 20:38.557
playing the ukulele
with the rabbits and the squirrels.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.398
I suppose I could... run away.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.634
Do it, man!

20:45.640 --> 20:47.995
<i>'I think that was good advice.</i>

20:48.040 --> 20:51.510
'I mean, I didn't actually
expect him to do it.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.551
'Maybe I wouldn't have said it

20:53.600 --> 20:56.160
if I thought there was any chance
of him actually doing it,

20:56.200 --> 20:59.272
'but... yep, there he goes.'

20:59.320 --> 21:01.436
'God, I'm running away.

21:01.480 --> 21:05.951
'This is brilliant. Maybe I'll go to a KFC
and have a whole bargain bucket.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.117
'Or I could join Al-Qaeda.
Maybe I'll marry my lap dancer.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.152
'I do think in a weird way
we had a connection.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.351
'Fuck the Blockbusters fine,
I'm going clear! '

21:15.400 --> 21:19.359
'Hiding out in a car park. He's not exactly
Grisly Adams, but it's a start.'

21:19.400 --> 21:20.879
(Big Suze) Jeremy?!

21:20.920 --> 21:23.229
Where's Mark?
What the hell are you doing here?

21:23.280 --> 21:27.432
I know my rights. I've spoken to my friends
at the Citizens Advice Bureau.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.630
Pay up or I shall make a disturbance.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.351
OK, sure, fine,
if it will make you feel any better.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.359
Here, £380.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.356
Cash. Will that do?

21:40.400 --> 21:44.188
I'll take it. But you know what?
This means nothing to me.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.515
I haven't got a penny in the world, Suze,

21:46.560 --> 21:49.028
but this means nothing to me without you.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.111
There, you see.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.594
Now do you see? That's how I feel.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.949
Now will you go back out with me?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.798
Er, no, Jez.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.434
I'm just not really that into you.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.595
In that case... if you'll excuse me...

22:14.600 --> 22:17.831
'Shit, this could be difficult
to row back from.

22:17.880 --> 22:21.111
'This isn't a misspelt e-mail,
this is going feral.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.152
'I mean, rejecting society, seeking
the company of wild creatures.

22:24.200 --> 22:27.112
'That's not going to look good
on my quarterly review.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.038
'What's Jeremy stealing?
Hotel napkins? '

22:30.080 --> 22:33.356
- Mark?
- Soph.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.392
What the fuck?
Why are you hiding behind a bush?

22:36.440 --> 22:38.237
Aren't you meant to be
in the big meeting?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.793
It doesn't work, Soph.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.798
Project Zeus, it's unworkable.
What am I going to do?

22:42.840 --> 22:44.751
Hey, look, it'll be OK.

22:44.800 --> 22:49.191
You know what, you should just
go in there and tell the truth.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.118
The truth?! Soph, this isn't
an advert, this is real life

22:52.160 --> 22:56.676
where cocks get chewed off and arses
get stuffed with compliance reports.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.153
Look, I know it's corny,

22:58.200 --> 23:01.510
but just tell them this is real life -
smelling the flowers.

23:01.560 --> 23:05.155
All that reports-up-bums stuff,
that's the bullshit.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.272
Just tell them the truth -
you're sorry, but you tried.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.788
- Do you really think?
- Of course.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.238
'Maybe she's right.
Maybe the truth does work.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.111
'Maybe Iraq was a good idea.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.799
'Maybe I am putting enough
into my pension plan.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.116
'Maybe computer games aren't
a waste of time. Maybe OJ's innocent.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.914
'Maybe everything's gonna be OK! '

23:29.880 --> 23:32.872
Everyone's wondering why
you climbed in through the window.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.992
Yeah, I don't play
by the rule book. What can I say?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.917
You don't use doors?

23:37.960 --> 23:40.110
Every window is also a door.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.229
Not every window.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.397
That depends, not tiny windows
like lavatory windows.

23:44.440 --> 23:48.228
OK, Mark is now going to take you
through the detail of Project Zeus.

23:48.280 --> 23:52.068
'Here I go. Palms dry, mouth dry,
inter-buttock area moist.'

23:52.120 --> 23:59.071
So integrating Sales
and Marketing - Project Zeus!

23:59.120 --> 24:02.476
The bad news is it doesn't work.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.392
But, look - big picture - so what?

24:07.440 --> 24:10.159
Maybe we shouldn't be in
the credit business at all.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.159
Maybe we should look at human rights
or global warming.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.193
These are just ideas.
But where's the humanity?

24:18.240 --> 24:22.233
I suppose that's what I want
to ask you today, if anything.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.350
Where is the humanity?

24:27.080 --> 24:28.308
Old friend.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.555
'Shit, I'm crashing and burning.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.275
'That stupid bloody hippy
sold me down the river.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.309
'Plan B.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.555
'What is Plan B? '

24:37.600 --> 24:42.469
Right, OK, you can stop the murmuring.
Please stop murmuring.

24:42.520 --> 24:48.197
Unless you think it's nice to murmur
at someone who's... dying.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.949
<i>'Did I just say that?
I did just say that.'</i>

24:52.000 --> 24:53.831
That's right, I've got brain cancer.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.314
Half my brain's been eaten away
already... probably.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.272
But I think I did
a pretty decent job

24:59.320 --> 25:02.198
for a man with a brain tumour
the size of a pineapple

25:02.240 --> 25:04.037
who's gonna be dead within a month.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.914
'Er, Plan C? Is there a Plan C? '

25:07.960 --> 25:11.555
Ah, ah, my brain!
My poor diseased brain!

25:13.360 --> 25:18.115
Yeah, I'd just like to assure everyone that
Mr Corrigan will indeed be dead in a month.
