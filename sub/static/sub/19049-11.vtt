00:02.174 --> 00:03.942
DENNIS: Frank, I'd like to
thank you for giving me the

00:04.009 --> 00:04.943
opportunity of a lifetime.

00:05.010 --> 00:05.944
FRANK: Whatever.

00:06.011 --> 00:07.612
I hope they have some cool,
exotic creatures for us to

00:07.680 --> 00:09.447
fiddle around with and play with.

00:09.515 --> 00:11.282
MAC: Dennis, we're going
to an animal rights event.

00:11.350 --> 00:13.118
There's gonna be all sorts
of exotic creatures there.

00:13.185 --> 00:14.119
You think so?

00:14.186 --> 00:15.120
SWEET DEE: Oh.

00:15.187 --> 00:16.988
They better have some
cool stuff at this thing.

00:17.056 --> 00:19.791
I mean, the money I laid out for this
charity... they could have built a zoo.

00:19.859 --> 00:21.793
Yeah. Actually, guys,
zoos are animal prisons.

00:21.861 --> 00:23.795
See, I've been boning up on my
animal rights literature so I

00:23.863 --> 00:25.797
can have some talking
points with Chase.

00:25.865 --> 00:27.799
He's a big animal rights lover,
and he's gonna be there.

00:27.867 --> 00:30.802
Security is not gonna let you go
anywhere near Chase Utley, bro.

00:30.870 --> 00:33.204
Those creepy letters
you've been writing him?

00:33.272 --> 00:35.607
You've got to be on a list somewhere.

00:35.674 --> 00:37.842
What are you giving me shit for, okay?

00:37.910 --> 00:38.843
Oh!

00:38.911 --> 00:40.712
Dee's the one going after
Ryan Howard all of a sudden.

00:40.780 --> 00:41.713
Well, so what?

00:41.781 --> 00:42.714
Why is that weird?

00:42.782 --> 00:43.715
That makes perfect sense.

00:43.783 --> 00:44.716
I'm a hot, single lady.

00:44.784 --> 00:45.717
He's a hot, single man.

00:45.785 --> 00:47.719
Hot? (laughs) Dee,
you're pregnant as shit.

00:47.787 --> 00:48.720
Frank, this shortcut sucks.

00:48.788 --> 00:49.721
It ain't a shortcut.

00:49.789 --> 00:51.723
Why in the hell are we in the woods?

00:51.791 --> 00:52.724
Get on the A.C. Expressway.

00:52.792 --> 00:53.725
Goes straight to Atlantic City.

00:53.793 --> 00:54.726
I'm avoiding tolls.

00:54.794 --> 00:55.727
Okay, hold on a second.

00:55.795 --> 00:57.729
You're willing to shell out tons
of money for a charity, and you

00:57.797 --> 00:59.731
can't spare a couple
bucks for a toll road?

00:59.799 --> 01:02.734
What? What do you want me to do, give
all my money to some toll jockey?

01:02.802 --> 01:03.735
Yeah.

01:03.803 --> 01:04.736
Just for riding on a street?

01:04.804 --> 01:06.738
Squirrel!

01:06.806 --> 01:08.273
(thudding)

01:41.510 --> 01:42.443
Oh, thank God.

01:42.511 --> 01:43.478
That was close.

01:43.546 --> 01:44.412
Why did you do that, Mac?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.413
Goddamn it!

01:45.481 --> 01:47.415
You almost ran over
that squirrel, Frank.

01:47.483 --> 01:50.142
So you should have
let me mash it.

01:50.262 --> 01:52.037
*

01:52.303 --> 01:55.476
*

01:55.591 --> 01:57.659
I can't wait to make my speech.

01:57.727 --> 01:59.661
I'm gonna get up there and lace
into these liberal nut jobs.

01:59.729 --> 02:01.997
What? I thought you
loved animals now.

02:02.064 --> 02:06.835
No. I only donated all this money so I
could make a mockery of their cause.

02:06.902 --> 02:09.738
Animals should be food,
rugs and trophies.

02:09.805 --> 02:12.107
Why do you think I'm
wearing a leather suit?

02:12.108 --> 02:13.275
Are you? Is that leather?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.276
Bet your ass it's leather.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.278
Huh.
I just assumed it was plastic.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.093
Who wears a plastic suit?

02:18.213 --> 02:19.124
I don't know, Frank.

02:19.244 --> 02:20.516
*

02:20.636 --> 02:22.587
All right, listen, I'm gonna call us
a tow truck and get us out of here.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.252
I'm not getting any bars, though.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.253
You getting any bars, Frank?

02:25.321 --> 02:26.254
I got nothing. What gives?

02:26.322 --> 02:28.256
What gives is that we're in the
middle of goddamn nowhere.

02:28.324 --> 02:29.257
(beep)

02:29.325 --> 02:30.258
(yelling and gasping)

02:30.326 --> 02:31.259
CHARLIE: What happened?

02:31.327 --> 02:32.260
Are we in A.C.?

02:32.328 --> 02:34.262
No, we're not in A.C.
because Mac wrecked the car, and now

02:34.330 --> 02:35.263
we're stranded somewhere.

02:35.331 --> 02:36.264
Oh, man!

02:36.332 --> 02:37.265
Oh.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.267
"Come to Atlantic City," you said.

02:39.335 --> 02:42.270
"Let us tie you up and put a sack on
your head so you don't freak out.

02:42.338 --> 02:43.104
That'll be a good adventure,"

02:43.172 --> 02:44.105
you said.

02:44.173 --> 02:46.107
Well, I'm freaking out a little bit.

02:46.175 --> 02:46.941
Right. Relax. Relax, Charlie.

02:47.009 --> 02:48.943
This is gonna be a great
adventure, this is exciting.

02:49.011 --> 02:49.944
This is the unknown.

02:50.012 --> 02:50.945
This is all part of it, man.

02:51.013 --> 02:52.947
Well, it ain't a great
adventure to me.

02:53.015 --> 02:54.883
Riding on a private jet, sipping
champagne... that's an adventure.

02:54.950 --> 02:56.885
Then why didn't you fly us
in a private jet to A.C.?

02:56.952 --> 02:57.986
It's only 80 miles.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.522
You know how quick that trip would be?

03:00.589 --> 03:01.790
Be a total waste of money.

03:01.857 --> 03:03.792
See, this is why I don't
leave Philly, all right?

03:03.859 --> 03:05.794
You leave Philly, and
bad shit happens.

03:05.861 --> 03:06.895
I mean trees? Everywhere trees?

03:06.962 --> 03:07.896
What the hell is this place?

03:07.963 --> 03:09.898
All right, I'm hitching
a ride back home.

03:09.965 --> 03:10.999
Calm down, Charlie.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.535
Let's all walk, and we'll
find some help, okay?

03:13.602 --> 03:15.537
I'm not walking, 'cause I got a
baby on board, my feet hurt.

03:15.604 --> 03:17.872
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
'cause this suit is, like,

03:17.940 --> 03:18.873
chafing me up like crazy.

03:18.941 --> 03:19.874
Oh, Jesus. All right.

03:19.942 --> 03:22.644
Mac and I and Charlie will go
find some help, okay? Okay?

03:22.712 --> 03:24.646
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
except I'm not gonna go.

03:24.714 --> 03:26.648
I'm gonna hang back
and oil up my glove.

03:26.716 --> 03:27.649
Your glove?

03:27.717 --> 03:28.650
What is your endgame in this?

03:28.718 --> 03:30.652
I'm gonna have a catch
with Chase Utley.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.655
You... We got... Chase Utley is
not gonna have a catch with you.

03:33.723 --> 03:34.656
Come on, come on.

03:34.724 --> 03:35.657
Don't you say that, Charlie!

03:35.725 --> 03:36.658
Don't you say that!

03:36.726 --> 03:37.659
Listen, listen.

03:37.727 --> 03:38.660
We're gonna find help, okay?

03:38.728 --> 03:39.728
Hurry up, guys.

03:39.795 --> 03:42.217
Hurry up, 'cause I
got to get to Chase.

03:47.104 --> 03:49.905
*

03:50.693 --> 03:51.575
*

03:51.695 --> 03:53.214
*

03:53.334 --> 03:56.042
*

03:56.162 --> 03:59.207
*

03:59.327 --> 04:02.240
*

04:03.500 --> 04:04.803
*

04:04.923 --> 04:06.678
*

04:06.798 --> 04:07.981
*

04:08.101 --> 04:09.689
*

04:09.980 --> 04:10.862
Well, listen.

04:10.982 --> 04:14.429
Sometimes, even I can't control everything,
so when a new experience presents

04:14.497 --> 04:18.433
itself to me, I try to stay
open to it and just say yes.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.434
Say yes, huh?

04:19.502 --> 04:21.435
Yeah.
Hey, let me show you something.

04:21.504 --> 04:22.437
Let me show you something.

04:22.505 --> 04:23.438
Look.

04:23.506 --> 04:24.439
Huh. You wearing makeup?

04:24.507 --> 04:26.641
Yeah, I'm always wearing a
little bit of foundation, but

04:26.709 --> 04:27.642
that's not the point, Charlie.

04:27.710 --> 04:28.643
What do you see there?

04:28.711 --> 04:29.644
Oh, shit!

04:29.712 --> 04:30.645
You got a lesion, dude.

04:30.713 --> 04:32.647
No, it's not...
That's not a lesion.

04:32.715 --> 04:33.648
It's a hickey.

04:33.716 --> 04:34.649
Oh.

04:34.717 --> 04:35.650
You never seen a hickey?

04:35.718 --> 04:36.651
No, I have. Ew! Weird!

04:36.719 --> 04:39.554
I thought women our age
didn't give hickeys anymore.

04:39.622 --> 04:40.555
Oh, no, they don't.

04:40.623 --> 04:42.657
Young ladies do, though, and I
met an extremely young lady the

04:42.725 --> 04:43.658
other day, and she gave me this.

04:43.726 --> 04:44.659
Weird.

04:44.727 --> 04:45.660
No, she was legal.

04:45.728 --> 04:46.661
She was totally legal.

04:46.729 --> 04:47.695
I always check their licenses.

04:47.763 --> 04:48.830
That's not the point.

04:48.898 --> 04:51.399
The point is, how did I
meet this young woman?

04:51.467 --> 04:53.935
Well, I got caught unexpectedly
in a rainstorm one day, so I

04:54.003 --> 04:55.136
retreated into a local theater.

04:55.204 --> 04:57.405
There, I caught a matinee.

04:57.473 --> 05:00.241
And during this matinee,
I saw this young woman.

05:00.309 --> 05:02.977
I introduced myself, and we both
got caught up in the moment, and

05:03.045 --> 05:05.013
we said yes to the new
experience, and that's how I

05:05.080 --> 05:07.282
wound up with this wonderful
and very sexual hickey.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.283
Oh.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.285
You see what I'm saying
about adventure, Charlie?

05:10.352 --> 05:12.654
Yeah, you always say
yes to everything.

05:12.721 --> 05:14.756
Well, no, I don't always say yes.

05:14.824 --> 05:15.757
That's absurd.

05:15.825 --> 05:17.759
I'd be a dead man, wouldn't I,
if I said yes to everything?

05:17.827 --> 05:18.927
Yeah. Oh, shit, dude.

05:18.994 --> 05:20.328
Look at that truck right there.

05:20.396 --> 05:21.396
Oh, yeah.

05:21.464 --> 05:23.398
You think there's someone in there?

05:23.466 --> 05:25.900
Well... what do we say in
this scenario, Charlie?

05:25.968 --> 05:27.068
We say yes.

05:27.136 --> 05:30.371
We say yes.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.609
Hiya.

05:34.677 --> 05:35.944
Sorry to wake you up there.

05:36.011 --> 05:36.945
Sorry.

05:37.012 --> 05:38.046
What do you want?

05:38.113 --> 05:40.048
Oh, uh, our car broke down a
little ways back, and we were

05:40.115 --> 05:42.050
hoping maybe you could help us out.

05:42.117 --> 05:44.052
Oh, I could, uh, radio that in
and get you a tow truck out

05:44.119 --> 05:46.054
here, but I'm about to
hit the road myself.

05:46.121 --> 05:48.056
You can always hitch a ride with me.

05:48.123 --> 05:49.157
Oh. Uh, where you headed?

05:49.225 --> 05:50.792
Atlantic City.

05:53.929 --> 05:55.864
You got any munchies in the car?

05:55.931 --> 05:56.865
I'm grumbling.

05:56.932 --> 05:58.867
No, Frank, we don't have
anything in the car because we

05:58.934 --> 06:01.202
were starving ourselves
for the casino buffet.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.271
It was only supposed to
be a 45-minute drive.

06:03.339 --> 06:04.806
I got to eat pretty soon.

06:04.874 --> 06:05.707
I'm starting to get woozy.

06:05.774 --> 06:08.409
Yeah, I'm starting to get woozy, too.

06:08.477 --> 06:10.612
I've been starving myself
for a few days for Chase.

06:10.679 --> 06:11.713
What?

06:11.780 --> 06:14.983
Oh, I wanted to create that sort
of gaunt, angular look with

06:15.050 --> 06:18.653
my cheekbones to impress him, you know,
give myself a more athletic look.

06:18.721 --> 06:20.522
But... (sighs) I'm starving.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.814
All right, let's jump into the forest,
and we'll find some food there.

06:22.934 --> 06:24.565
*

06:24.685 --> 06:27.099
*

06:27.365 --> 06:29.592
We are not killing any animals, okay?

06:29.712 --> 06:31.833
Screw that! I'm hungry.

06:31.901 --> 06:33.655
It's wabbit season.

06:34.215 --> 06:35.603
Okay, fine.

06:35.671 --> 06:36.704
Dee, come with me.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.009
I'm gonna find us something to eat.

06:38.597 --> 06:41.426
Where are you, wabbit?

06:42.144 --> 06:45.405
I'm gonna get you, wabbit.

06:47.516 --> 06:49.384
Oh.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.252
There you are.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.522
(gun chamber clicks)

06:54.590 --> 06:56.597
What the hell!

06:58.249 --> 06:59.439
Wabbit?

06:59.859 --> 07:01.106
Where'd you go?

07:01.830 --> 07:03.164
(rustling in brush)

07:03.232 --> 07:07.235
(gasps)

07:07.303 --> 07:08.503
Shit!

07:08.571 --> 07:12.473
How'd you do that?

07:12.541 --> 07:15.543
Why are you staring at me?

07:15.611 --> 07:17.912
Why you giving me that look?

07:17.980 --> 07:20.048
Whoa.

07:20.115 --> 07:24.285
We're having a moment here, aren't we?

07:24.353 --> 07:27.288
(sighs)

07:37.113 --> 07:40.348
You boys are, uh...
awfully dressed up. (chuckles)

07:40.416 --> 07:41.983
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, the tuxes.

07:42.051 --> 07:45.687
Sure, yeah, well, we're on our way to
Atlantic City for a charity event.

07:45.755 --> 07:47.822
You kind of threw me
with those outfits.

07:47.890 --> 07:52.160
Don't usually find lot lizards out in
the wild. Yeah, you know what, I'm a

07:52.228 --> 07:53.561
little behind on my trucker terms.

07:53.629 --> 07:56.598
A "lot lizard" would be a, uh...?

07:56.666 --> 07:58.333
A lizard.

07:58.401 --> 07:59.334
You know, truck stop whores.

07:59.402 --> 08:00.902
I mean...
Oh!

08:00.970 --> 08:01.670
Oh!

08:01.737 --> 08:02.938
No, no... no offense.

08:03.005 --> 08:04.306
No, man, none taken.

08:04.373 --> 08:05.307
Because we're not whores.

08:05.374 --> 08:07.309
No, no, we're not prostitutes.

08:07.376 --> 08:08.310
Definitely not a lizard.

08:08.377 --> 08:10.178
Hey, hey, hey, shh.

08:10.246 --> 08:11.346
Hey.

08:11.414 --> 08:12.914
Your secret's safe with me.

08:12.982 --> 08:14.082
Don't worry, too, I'm not a cop.

08:14.150 --> 08:16.251
And I'm not gonna judge you, neither.

08:16.319 --> 08:19.254
A man's got to make a living, and looking
the way you do, I'm not surprised.

08:19.322 --> 08:20.255
I'm not surprised.

08:20.323 --> 08:23.258
Oh, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, but again...
Not lizards, though.

08:23.326 --> 08:24.259
Not prostitutes.

08:24.327 --> 08:27.262
Save your seduction for
someone else, all right?

08:27.330 --> 08:29.397
I do not tangle with lizards no more.

08:29.465 --> 08:33.802
No. Back in the day, sure,
I would've indulged, hell!

08:33.869 --> 08:38.139
I would've let you turn me
into Swiss cheese. (chuckles)

08:38.207 --> 08:41.943
I would've let you make me a...
make me into a mailbox... just

08:42.010 --> 08:44.479
open the slot and put
whatever you want inside.

08:44.547 --> 08:46.614
Oh...
Not no more.

08:46.682 --> 08:47.782
I got a wife now.

08:47.850 --> 08:52.220
So I will not suck you, and I
will not be sucked on... by you.

08:52.288 --> 08:53.254
'Kay?

08:53.322 --> 08:54.756
That's it.

08:54.824 --> 08:55.890
That's a 10-4.

08:55.958 --> 08:59.694
Yeah, we read you loud and clear,
and just to reiterate, we

08:59.762 --> 09:03.698
don't suck on people... we own a bar.
So... You run a bar? (laughs)

09:03.766 --> 09:05.168
Yeah, well, I'm sure you do.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.050
*

09:07.709 --> 09:09.249
*

09:09.369 --> 09:13.261
*

09:13.381 --> 09:15.538
*

09:19.203 --> 09:19.705
It's grass, Mac.

09:19.825 --> 09:20.433
You're eating grass.

09:20.556 --> 09:22.490
Well, look, I see Charlie eating
grass all the time, okay?

09:22.558 --> 09:23.491
Oh, really?

09:23.559 --> 09:25.493
Okay, well, Charlie is not an
example of good health, so...

09:25.561 --> 09:27.495
Look, Charlie is a
survivor, all right?

09:27.563 --> 09:29.497
And that's the way we have to
think... eat anything to survive.

09:29.565 --> 09:32.066
Oh. What is that?

09:32.134 --> 09:33.601
That's a dead crow.

09:33.669 --> 09:35.403
Well, I'm definitely not eating that.

09:35.471 --> 09:37.839
Wait, whoa, whoa. Why not?

09:37.906 --> 09:40.241
Because it is a disgusting
dead bird, that's why.

09:40.309 --> 09:43.244
You eat dead chickens and dead turkeys
all the time... that's so hypocritical.

09:43.312 --> 09:46.047
Okay, that's not hypocritical...
people eat chickens and turkeys.

09:46.115 --> 09:46.914
Nobody eats a crow.

09:46.982 --> 09:47.915
It's a trash bird.

09:47.983 --> 09:48.950
You know what I do think?

09:49.017 --> 09:50.885
I think we're gonna give
this crow a proper burial.

09:50.953 --> 09:51.986
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

09:52.054 --> 09:54.288
But what I will is use it as bait.

09:54.356 --> 09:56.290
Ooh. What if we hide in the
bushes, and then we wait for

09:56.358 --> 09:58.292
something higher on the food
chain to come along and grab it,

09:58.360 --> 10:00.294
and then we grab that and eat
it... that's a good idea.

10:00.362 --> 10:01.295
I'm gonna go to the car.

10:01.363 --> 10:02.063
I'm not doing it. No.

10:02.131 --> 10:03.865
I'm gonna go to the car and
I'm gonna get a blanket, then

10:03.932 --> 10:06.234
we can pick up this trash bird
with it, and we'll do my plan.

10:06.301 --> 10:06.968
I'm not helping you.

10:07.035 --> 10:08.636
That's all right, I'll do
it myself... I'll eat alone.

10:08.704 --> 10:10.605
I'm gonna find Frank, I'm gonna
get him on my team, okay?

10:10.672 --> 10:11.093
Good.

10:14.476 --> 10:15.490
Frank?

10:17.112 --> 10:18.646
Hey, Frank, where are you, bro?

10:18.714 --> 10:19.947
Oh, there you are.

10:20.015 --> 10:21.048
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:21.116 --> 10:23.571
(whispers): Mac, I'm having a
thing with this rabbit here.

10:26.121 --> 10:28.055
(whispers): Whoa, dude!

10:28.123 --> 10:30.725
He's staring right at you.

10:30.793 --> 10:34.162
We've been staring at each
other for ten minutes.

10:34.229 --> 10:36.164
I-I... He's not afraid of me.

10:36.231 --> 10:39.400
He's looking at me like he knows
me, he's looking at me like he

10:39.468 --> 10:40.635
can see right through my soul.

10:40.702 --> 10:42.270
He probably can, dude.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.772
That is the connection
between man and beast.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.008
Animals can see souls.

10:47.075 --> 10:48.343
That is a fact of nature.

10:50.913 --> 10:51.846
(Sweet Dee yells)

10:51.914 --> 10:52.847
Oh!

10:52.915 --> 10:54.849
Deandra, what the hell are you doing?!

10:54.917 --> 10:56.150
Oh, you guys, I got it.

10:56.218 --> 10:57.185
I got it.

10:57.252 --> 10:57.985
We can eat.

10:58.053 --> 10:59.787
We can't eat the rabbit...
he's got my soul.

10:59.855 --> 11:00.822
What are you talking about?

11:00.889 --> 11:01.856
They had a moment, Dee.

11:01.924 --> 11:02.790
They shared a connection.

11:02.858 --> 11:04.959
I know it's cute, you guys, but,
come on, this isn't about

11:05.027 --> 11:06.727
us anymore... I got to feed the baby.

11:06.795 --> 11:08.930
Mac, grab it by the head
and wring its neck off.

11:08.997 --> 11:11.499
I would rather grab your head and
wring your neck, for wanting

11:11.567 --> 11:12.533
to kill this rabbit, all right?

11:12.601 --> 11:14.936
You want to eat it
so bad, you kill it.

11:15.003 --> 11:16.070
Fine. I will kill it.

11:16.138 --> 11:18.172
I'll kill it, and I'll eat it myself.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.372
I'm gonna kill the
shit out of it.

11:28.485 --> 11:29.908
*

11:30.028 --> 11:34.970
*

11:35.090 --> 11:35.823
Great, yeah, thanks.

11:35.891 --> 11:38.392
No, we were hoping to be dropped
off at a casino, though.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.827
This is just a motel.

11:39.895 --> 11:46.733
I know, and I thought we would slip into
a room, and you... could check my oil.

11:47.105 --> 11:51.939
Oh. No. Um...
What happened, man?

11:52.007 --> 11:52.707
No, I'm sorry. No.

11:52.774 --> 11:53.407
No.

11:53.475 --> 11:57.311
Shoot, hell, maybe I knew I wanted it when I...
I gave you the ride.

11:57.379 --> 11:59.280
No, no, no, no, you're better...
Byron.

11:59.348 --> 12:00.114
Remember you changed?

12:00.182 --> 12:02.717
Byron, you've changed... you don't
want this kind of thing anymore.

12:02.784 --> 12:04.252
No, I do want this kind of thing.

12:04.319 --> 12:05.052
No, you don't.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.355
You would not suck me and you
would not, um, be sucked by me.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.222
Be sucked by us.

12:08.290 --> 12:09.156
I take that back.

12:09.224 --> 12:09.891
I don't mean that.

12:09.958 --> 12:11.993
You can't take that back, Byron!

12:12.060 --> 12:14.028
I didn't mean any of those...
Look, man, think about your

12:14.096 --> 12:15.563
wife... remember, you
said you love your wife.

12:15.631 --> 12:16.264
I do, I do, I do.

12:16.331 --> 12:16.931
Good.

12:16.999 --> 12:21.002
I do, but... (whispers): I got cash
in my pocket, I got desire in my

12:21.069 --> 12:23.604
heart, and I'm a-frothin' and
a-foamin', and I was thinking...

12:23.672 --> 12:26.674
hey, hey, I got an idea.

12:26.742 --> 12:32.146
What do you say...
we slip into a room and you two

12:32.214 --> 12:33.147
split me open like a coconut?

12:33.215 --> 12:36.717
Oh... Dennis, what do we
say in this situation?

12:36.785 --> 12:37.451
We say no.

12:37.519 --> 12:39.687
Why? No? Why?

12:39.755 --> 12:41.555
It's just... Oh, my God!

12:41.623 --> 12:43.891
Another...
(Charlie yells)

12:43.959 --> 12:44.725
(door slams shut)

12:44.793 --> 12:47.028
Should've locked my damn door.

12:47.095 --> 12:50.031
I should've locked the door.

12:53.101 --> 12:55.569
Yeah, well, that was
definitely an adventure, huh?

12:55.637 --> 12:58.072
Yeah, well, sometimes the
adventures aren't always good ones.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.474
Yeah, but I said yes to the
new experience, right?

13:00.542 --> 13:03.778
I'm out of Philly, I'm alive, and
I'm not afraid of truckers anymore.

13:03.845 --> 13:06.347
Yeah, well, if anything, you should
be more afraid of truckers now.

13:06.415 --> 13:07.348
But I do see your point.

13:07.416 --> 13:10.356
Hey, listen, I'm gonna try and get
in touch with the guys, okay?

13:12.955 --> 13:13.554
Aw, shit.

13:13.622 --> 13:15.723
Dude, I left my jacket in the truck.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.024
I had everything in that jacket.

13:17.092 --> 13:19.794
I had all my money, I had my
phone... do you have any money?

13:19.861 --> 13:21.796
Uh, yeah, it's all right there.

13:21.863 --> 13:23.230
I put it all on black.

13:23.298 --> 13:24.632
What? No, no, no, no, no!

13:24.700 --> 13:25.599
Black wins!

13:25.667 --> 13:26.801
Baby!

13:26.868 --> 13:28.836
Oh, phew! All right, but that
was lucky, that was lucky.

13:28.904 --> 13:31.105
Yeah, I know, but you know
what, dude, you were right...

13:31.173 --> 13:33.007
I said yes to this little
adventure and I won.

13:33.075 --> 13:34.508
Would you like to bet again, sir?

13:34.576 --> 13:35.276
Yes, I would.

13:35.344 --> 13:36.143
No. No. No.

13:36.211 --> 13:37.044
Let it ride, please.

13:37.112 --> 13:37.912
What are you doing?

13:37.980 --> 13:39.580
Dude, I am gonna say
yes to everything!

13:39.648 --> 13:40.982
We can't say yes to everything.

13:41.049 --> 13:42.183
That is all of our money, dude.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.050
No, it's all my money.

13:43.118 --> 13:44.552
You lost yours when you
said no to the trucker.

13:44.619 --> 13:46.876
What? Did you want to say yes
to the trucker?

13:46.902 --> 13:48.073
*

13:48.193 --> 13:50.739
*

13:50.859 --> 13:52.360
walk away with a free 18-wheeler.

13:52.427 --> 13:54.495
Dude, we are gonna
lose all of our money.

13:54.563 --> 13:55.363
Black wins again!

13:55.430 --> 13:57.898
Oh, baby! Whoo! Yes!

13:57.966 --> 13:59.200
Yes, yes!

13:59.267 --> 14:00.201
Let it ride, please.

14:00.268 --> 14:00.868
Let it ride.

14:00.936 --> 14:03.904
Okay, okay, yeah, let it ride.

14:07.309 --> 14:08.676
I want to bash you, bunny.

14:08.744 --> 14:12.046
I want to give you one good bash and
eat your sweet, delicious meat.

14:12.114 --> 14:14.349
You can't kill the rabbit,
Deandra... it's got my soul.

14:14.416 --> 14:15.516
It's got the man's soul, Dee.

14:15.584 --> 14:16.718
Maybe I'll suffocate you.

14:16.785 --> 14:19.287
I'll suffocate your rabbit face,
and then I'll just suck all the

14:19.355 --> 14:23.091
life out of it and then... twist your neck and...
Look, can we do this thing,

14:23.158 --> 14:24.258
for crying out loud?

14:24.326 --> 14:25.293
Yes, absolutely.

14:25.361 --> 14:28.329
This is absolutely ridiculous,
holding a funeral for a crow.

14:28.397 --> 14:29.597
Yes, that's right, we are.

14:29.665 --> 14:30.732
We are honoring its life.

14:30.799 --> 14:32.033
I want to say a couple words.

14:32.101 --> 14:32.767
Yes, please.

14:32.835 --> 14:36.537
Uh, I've never been good to animals,
wearing a leather suit and all.

14:36.605 --> 14:40.908
And, uh, also, I kicked a dog
in a subway once, it was a real

14:40.976 --> 14:44.212
jerk move, and I'm really sorry I
did it, and I like animals now.

14:44.279 --> 14:45.113
That was beautiful, Frank.

14:45.180 --> 14:46.848
Okay, where the hell are
Charlie and Dennis?

14:46.915 --> 14:48.683
I feel like they're not
coming back for us.

14:48.751 --> 14:50.485
Okay, they're coming back, okay?

14:50.552 --> 14:54.422
Guys...
let's just do the right thing.

14:54.490 --> 14:56.858
Good night... sweet prince.

14:56.925 --> 15:01.262
Oh, God, you-you got to be kidding me.
Come on.

15:01.330 --> 15:04.399
FRANK AND MAC: ♪ Ave Maria... ♪

15:04.466 --> 15:07.769
Are you kidding me?

15:07.836 --> 15:09.537
(orchestra plays)

15:09.605 --> 15:12.073
(crowd chatter)

15:12.141 --> 15:14.075
I mean, I never thought
I would hold $15,000.

15:14.143 --> 15:15.076
Amazing, bro.

15:15.144 --> 15:17.078
Listen, I thought I was
teaching you today.

15:17.146 --> 15:20.081
Let me tell you something, my
friend, you were teaching me.

15:20.149 --> 15:21.343
I know. I mean, look at
all this amazing food.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.170
Oh, I'm starving.!

15:22.290 --> 15:24.312
*

15:25.040 --> 15:25.887
What is that?

15:26.007 --> 15:27.741
DEBRA: Hi, there.
You two are with the Reynolds party, yes?

15:27.809 --> 15:28.909
Yeah. Yes.

15:28.977 --> 15:29.910
Is one of you Frank?

15:29.978 --> 15:31.912
Oh, actually, uh...
Yes.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.580
Hi, Mr. Reynolds.

15:33.648 --> 15:34.681
I'm Debra.

15:34.749 --> 15:35.882
We spoke on the phone.

15:35.950 --> 15:36.883
Yes. Yes.

15:36.951 --> 15:39.786
Well, now, I know you'd
like to say a few words.

15:39.854 --> 15:41.955
Is it all right if we
have you up to speak now?

15:42.023 --> 15:43.991
Uh...
Yes, it is.

15:44.058 --> 15:44.992
Great.

15:45.059 --> 15:47.527
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

15:47.595 --> 15:50.897
Mr. Reynolds here is one
of our largest new donors.

15:50.965 --> 15:55.927
Well, it's donors like him that makes
our work for animals possible.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.871
(applause)

15:57.939 --> 15:58.639
Thank you.

15:58.706 --> 16:00.140
Thank you.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.341
I am Frank Reynolds.

16:01.409 --> 16:02.342
Yes, yes, yes.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.511
Yes, yes.

16:04.579 --> 16:05.512
Yes.

16:05.580 --> 16:08.015
That's the word I want to talk about.

16:08.082 --> 16:10.384
But first, let's talk about animals.

16:10.451 --> 16:11.451
Yeah.

16:11.519 --> 16:13.654
If animals have taught me
anything, it's that you can

16:13.721 --> 16:18.859
easily die, and very quickly, under
a bus and on the side of the road.

16:18.926 --> 16:19.860
Yes.

16:19.927 --> 16:21.862
Okay?
So you have to live in the now.

16:21.929 --> 16:22.863
Live in the now!

16:22.930 --> 16:23.864
Mm-hmm.

16:23.931 --> 16:25.866
I'm gonna live in the now right now.

16:25.933 --> 16:28.702
I'm gonna donate another $5,000
to this charity right now.

16:28.770 --> 16:29.770
Oh! Oh!

16:29.837 --> 16:32.606
That's a...
That's too generous.

16:32.674 --> 16:33.607
This is for the rats.

16:33.675 --> 16:34.608
Take it easy.

16:34.676 --> 16:35.509
All right. Oh!

16:35.576 --> 16:36.510
For the rats, people.

16:36.577 --> 16:38.512
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

16:38.579 --> 16:39.513
And I'm done.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.514
Good, good.

16:40.581 --> 16:42.816
Uh, Mr.
Reynolds, there's one more thing.

16:42.884 --> 16:45.485
Per your request, we were able
to arrange a surprise night for

16:45.553 --> 16:48.889
your friend with two true
all-stars of our organization...

16:48.956 --> 16:53.193
Chase Utley and Ryan Howard
of the Philadelphia Phillies.

16:53.261 --> 16:54.528
Oh!

16:54.595 --> 16:57.531
(laughter)

16:57.598 --> 16:58.632
Hi.

16:58.700 --> 16:59.833
CHASE: Mac, right?

16:59.901 --> 17:01.768
Uh... yes.

17:01.836 --> 17:04.003
I hear you're my number one fan.

17:04.071 --> 17:06.173
Yes, I am.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.473
Hi. Hi.

17:07.541 --> 17:08.141

We're just having fun.

18:23.785 --> 18:25.719
I just saw you bite that dude.

18:25.787 --> 18:27.721
Yeah, it was a...
He took a bite.

18:27.789 --> 18:28.722
It was a fair bite.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.724
Yeah, I do like to
bite him a little bit.

18:30.792 --> 18:31.725
Man, come here, come here.

18:31.793 --> 18:32.726
Wrestle with us, dude.

18:32.794 --> 18:33.727
Hey, yeah.

18:33.795 --> 18:34.728
You guys are wasted, man.

18:34.796 --> 18:35.729
Let's wrestle.

18:35.797 --> 18:36.730
Yeah, you're wasted.

18:36.798 --> 18:37.731
No, we're not.

18:37.799 --> 18:38.732
You're not wasted?

18:38.800 --> 18:41.701
No, no, we're completely sober,
but you guys drank a lot, though.

18:41.769 --> 18:42.702
Yeah.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.704
You guys drink more than
anybody I've ever seen.

18:44.772 --> 18:45.705
Oh, really, dude?

18:45.773 --> 18:46.706
Oh, really? (whoops)

18:46.774 --> 18:47.707
Ah... (chuckles)

18:47.775 --> 18:48.708
Good work, Charlie. Yeah.

18:48.776 --> 18:49.476
That's what we do.

18:49.544 --> 18:54.014
Well, you know, it's been great, fellas,
but, uh, we're gonna take off now.

18:54.081 --> 18:55.015
Oh!

18:55.082 --> 18:56.116
Really? You guys gonna go?

18:56.184 --> 18:57.984
Yeah, you guys, try not to
hurt anybody tonight, okay?

18:58.052 --> 18:58.985
Nah, dude, nah.

18:59.053 --> 19:00.020
No, no, no, we're good, dude.

19:00.087 --> 19:01.021
We're good, dude.

19:01.088 --> 19:02.756
Get off me, though, for reals.

19:02.824 --> 19:03.423
Okay.

19:03.491 --> 19:04.090
You guys take care, okay?

19:04.158 --> 19:04.925
Yeah.

19:04.992 --> 19:05.926
All right.

19:05.993 --> 19:07.594
Whoo! Boy, that was a...
(Charlie yells)

19:07.662 --> 19:08.929
...hell of a night, man.

19:08.996 --> 19:10.263
Hell of a night, man.

19:10.331 --> 19:12.265
Hey, how much money do we have left?

19:12.333 --> 19:13.233
10,000 bucks.

19:13.301 --> 19:14.734
(Charlie laughs)

19:14.802 --> 19:17.771
I got an idea how we
can spend that shit.

19:17.839 --> 19:18.772
BOTH (chanting): Champagne!

19:18.840 --> 19:19.906
Champagne!

19:19.974 --> 19:20.907
Champagne! Champagne!

19:20.975 --> 19:22.909
PENELOPE: Here we go, gentlemen.

19:22.977 --> 19:24.711
(cheering, mumbling)

19:24.779 --> 19:27.414
Thank you, Penelope.

19:27.482 --> 19:29.716
(Frank grunting)

19:29.784 --> 19:31.618
Oh, it's tearing me up inside.

19:31.686 --> 19:33.019
What? What?!

19:33.087 --> 19:34.988
What's going on?

19:35.056 --> 19:36.756
Frank, what are you doing?

19:36.824 --> 19:39.025
I ate the crow.

19:39.093 --> 19:40.627
What... what'd he say?

19:40.695 --> 19:41.628
What?

19:41.696 --> 19:43.029
I ate the crow.

19:43.097 --> 19:44.297
Why?

19:44.365 --> 19:45.765
I dug it up last night.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.702
I thought it would taste like
chicken, but I was wrong.

19:48.769 --> 19:49.803
Oh, my God.

19:49.871 --> 19:52.038
I think I got to go to a hospital.

19:52.106 --> 19:53.039
All right.

19:53.107 --> 19:55.998
All right, look, they're clearly
not coming back for us, okay?

19:56.118 --> 19:57.273
*

19:59.981 --> 20:01.314
Oh.

20:01.382 --> 20:03.016
Oh, man.

20:03.084 --> 20:05.719
Seriously, I'm gonna be sad
when this is all over.

20:05.786 --> 20:10.156
Yeah, well, all good adventures
must come to an end at some point.

20:10.224 --> 20:11.224
All good things are ending.

20:11.292 --> 20:12.192
(exhales loudly)

20:12.260 --> 20:14.995
I shouldn't still be drinking.

20:15.062 --> 20:16.096
Hey.

20:16.163 --> 20:17.230
Mm-hmn?

20:17.298 --> 20:19.799
I just thought of one last
thing that would be awesome.

20:19.867 --> 20:20.567
Give me your phone.

20:20.635 --> 20:22.577
All right.

20:25.540 --> 20:29.776
Oh, this is gonna be...
this is gonna be awesome, dude.

20:29.844 --> 20:30.777
It's just gonna be great.

20:30.845 --> 20:32.679
(both laughing)

20:32.747 --> 20:34.881
Look at this.

20:34.949 --> 20:37.517
I know, it feels like we're
walking a lot here, bunny, but I

20:37.585 --> 20:39.486
tell you what, as soon as we get
back to the bar, you can have as

20:39.554 --> 20:41.688
many carrots as your
little heart desires.

20:41.756 --> 20:44.691
Dee, first you wanted to kill it, and
now you're bringing it back to the bar?

20:44.759 --> 20:45.692
Yeah.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.161
I named him Peter Peter Nickel Eater.

20:48.229 --> 20:50.864
'Cause last night in the car,
he tried to eat a nickel.

20:50.932 --> 20:52.899
It was the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

20:52.967 --> 20:55.402
I say you bash its
brains in right now.

20:55.469 --> 20:57.170
I'm done liking animals.

20:57.238 --> 20:59.506
This crow is eating me alive!

20:59.574 --> 21:00.507
(coughing)

21:00.575 --> 21:04.044
Frank, you are sick because
you ate rancid, maggot-filled

21:04.111 --> 21:05.412
meat, not because of animals.

21:05.479 --> 21:07.647
And, Dee, you've got to
set that rabbit free.

21:07.715 --> 21:08.715
Really?

21:08.783 --> 21:12.619
Yes! It needs to live in the
wild, where it can be free and

21:12.687 --> 21:15.722
safe in the loving embrace
of Mother Nature, okay?

21:15.790 --> 21:18.825
Trust me, Peter Nickels-Eater
is gonna be much happier.

21:18.893 --> 21:20.627
Yeah, all right.

21:20.695 --> 21:21.695
You're right.

21:21.762 --> 21:24.698
Okay, buddy, I love you, but
go back to your family now.

21:24.765 --> 21:25.699
Go on.

21:25.766 --> 21:26.700
Okay.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.501
See? He's happier already.

21:28.569 --> 21:32.005
He's gonna go back to his mother
and father, and he's gonna have

21:32.073 --> 21:33.473
a wonderful life.

21:33.541 --> 21:34.474
(bird screeches)

21:34.542 --> 21:35.642
(all gasp)

21:35.710 --> 21:38.311
God... damn it!

21:38.379 --> 21:39.613
Goddamn it!

21:39.680 --> 21:40.614
Okay, nature is bullshit.

21:40.681 --> 21:41.615
I'm done with this.

21:41.682 --> 21:42.749
I told you, animals suck.

21:42.817 --> 21:44.084
(phone vibrating)

21:44.151 --> 21:46.019
Oh. Wait. Was that a text?

21:46.087 --> 21:46.987
You getting reception?

21:47.054 --> 21:48.755
Yes, I guess I'm getting
reception... I just got a text.

21:48.823 --> 21:49.756
Oh, it's from Dennis.

21:49.824 --> 21:50.757
Ooh.

21:50.825 --> 21:53.827
I think he sent me a picture.

21:53.894 --> 21:56.062
No.

21:56.130 --> 21:57.831
No!

21:57.898 --> 22:00.433
Oh! You guys, you guys, a car!
Hey!

22:00.501 --> 22:01.434
No.

22:01.502 --> 22:02.469
Hi-yo!

22:02.536 --> 22:03.470
Hey! Wait-wait-wait-wait!

22:03.537 --> 22:04.471
Wait!

22:04.538 --> 22:05.538
Oh, good.

22:05.606 --> 22:06.539
(Sweet Dee coughs)

22:06.607 --> 22:07.607
Hey there!

22:07.675 --> 22:08.608
Y'all need a ride?

22:08.676 --> 22:09.609
(laughing): Yes. Yes.

22:09.677 --> 22:11.896
Yeah.

22:12.429 --> 22:14.403
Must be hot, huh?

22:14.641 --> 22:17.539
