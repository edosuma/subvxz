00:41.968 --> 00:43.670
That's beautiful.

00:44.493 --> 00:47.161
Yeah, if you're a farmer's wife.

00:47.162 --> 00:49.100
Ma, come on.
My birthday was last month.

00:49.101 --> 00:50.099
It's fine.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.053
Well, we're not leaving

00:51.054 --> 00:53.908
Until we find something
that we both like.

00:53.909 --> 00:56.882
Did you bring food and water?

00:58.771 --> 01:01.002
All right. Do me a favor.
Try this one on.

01:01.003 --> 01:02.479
No! Let me see.

01:03.612 --> 01:06.504
Every girl needs an l.B.D.

01:06.505 --> 01:09.302
Not me. I...Got vaccinated.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.479
Come on!

01:11.657 --> 01:12.900
Let me see it.

01:15.187 --> 01:16.570
Wow!

01:16.605 --> 01:18.888
That is one stunning

01:19.521 --> 01:21.613
Little black dress.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.231
And, Jane?

01:24.265 --> 01:26.181
You look beautiful.

01:27.598 --> 01:29.106
Mom, where am I gonna wear this?

01:29.140 --> 01:30.922
A murder at the Boston pops?

01:30.956 --> 01:33.643
Okay, we're not leaving
until we buy it.

01:35.152 --> 01:38.108
Okay, okay. Fine.
Get the damn dress.

01:39.216 --> 01:41.297
It'll look fabulous in my closet.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.544
Thank you.

01:45.194 --> 01:46.208
Rizzoli.

01:46.209 --> 01:48.236
Hey. G... mom! Knock! Come on!

01:48.270 --> 01:51.495
What? Like I haven't
seen that before?

01:52.007 --> 01:53.845
Okay, frost. I'll meet you there.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.196
Okay.

01:55.197 --> 01:55.986
Yeah.

01:56.021 --> 01:57.527
No, no. I'll be right there.

01:57.561 --> 01:58.804
All right.

01:58.839 --> 01:59.877
I love you.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.794
No, not... no, not you. Bye.

02:02.828 --> 02:04.671
Okay. I'll see you later. Okay.

02:04.706 --> 02:06.178
Thank you, mom!

02:19.614 --> 02:22.394
Jane Rizzoli. Victor 825.

02:24.237 --> 02:26.172
Damn. Look how young he is.

02:27.418 --> 02:30.303
No obvious signs of injury.
It's odd.

02:30.304 --> 02:32.409
Listen. I can promise you

02:32.410 --> 02:35.305
That we are working tirelessly
for justice in this case.

02:35.306 --> 02:37.852
No, no, no... yeah, "Tirelessly.
" Look at him work.

02:37.886 --> 02:40.665
Shh! Somebody might hear you.

02:40.699 --> 02:42.436
But as you know, uh,
Boston has some of the...

02:43.242 --> 02:46.121
I wonder if that guy has, like,
a satellite for the news van.

02:46.155 --> 02:47.796
No, he's not a cop. All right?

02:47.830 --> 02:49.704
He's a police officer.
He's a climber.

02:49.739 --> 02:50.809
He's an ass!

02:50.843 --> 02:52.281
Well, he's got a lot of pulp.

02:52.282 --> 02:55.379
"Juice." We say, "
Guy's got juice."

02:55.380 --> 02:57.269
And you're gonna be drinking
yours out of a sippy cup

02:57.270 --> 02:58.907
If you don't lower your voice.

02:59.393 --> 03:01.007
What killed this kid?
I don't see anything.

03:01.008 --> 03:03.751
There's no... no knife wounds...

03:03.786 --> 03:05.890
No bullet entry or exit wounds.

03:05.891 --> 03:09.371
No external sign of trauma
to indicate a beating.

03:09.372 --> 03:11.313
Wasn't killed for his stuff.

03:11.347 --> 03:12.684
His school I.D.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.163
"Mathias senna."

03:16.247 --> 03:17.986
15... God.

03:18.021 --> 03:19.794
I'm never having kids.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.608
What do you got for me, Rizzoli?

03:25.021 --> 03:27.931
Don't you want to wait
for the camera crews?

03:27.965 --> 03:29.669
There's no obvious cause of death.

03:29.703 --> 03:31.042
I'll know more after the autopsy.

03:33.461 --> 03:35.066
Hey, hey. Hey.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.893
Don't touch anything in
my crime scene, all right?

03:38.031 --> 03:39.935
So as to not contaminate.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.237
Right.

03:41.271 --> 03:43.772
You might want to take
a look under there.

03:52.453 --> 03:54.171
I'm not finished
processing the scene.

03:54.205 --> 03:57.281
Well, I bet that you could
match those shoe prints

03:57.315 --> 03:58.651
To that skateboard...

03:58.685 --> 04:00.123
If you tried.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.426
I'd do it myself,

04:01.953 --> 04:03.647
But I don't want to
contaminate your crime scene.

04:03.648 --> 04:05.950
Thank you. That's very helpful.

04:06.509 --> 04:08.748
You're welcome.

04:09.299 --> 04:10.338
Bye.

04:12.190 --> 04:13.528
That went well.

04:13.562 --> 04:16.600
Find something.

05:02.566 --> 05:03.533
Mathias?

05:03.567 --> 05:04.934
Mathias?!

05:04.968 --> 05:06.269
Mathias.

05:07.904 --> 05:10.338
Mathias.

05:12.207 --> 05:13.941
Mathias.

05:16.044 --> 05:17.544
No!

05:17.579 --> 05:19.679
No, no, no, no.

05:19.713 --> 05:21.347
No, no, no.

05:21.381 --> 05:23.048
Mathias.

05:29.767 --> 05:32.824
He didn't come home last night.

05:32.858 --> 05:34.958
I even called his father.

05:34.993 --> 05:35.992
You're divorced?

05:36.861 --> 05:39.561
Since he was 10. We are fighting.

05:39.595 --> 05:41.564
Over custody of Mathias?

05:42.934 --> 05:46.002
All he wanted to
do was skateboard.

05:46.037 --> 05:48.571
I told him it's not
safe out there!

05:48.605 --> 05:50.639
He wouldn't listen.

05:50.674 --> 05:53.574
The devil got into my boy.

05:55.009 --> 05:57.543
And left me alone with his curse.

05:57.578 --> 05:58.911
What do you mean "The devil"?

05:58.946 --> 06:00.913
He was not the same
after he met those boys!

06:00.948 --> 06:03.315
The skateboarders.

06:03.349 --> 06:05.083
We'll need their names.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.919
I don't know them.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.753
I just know they are bad.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.222
Mrs. Senna...

06:13.885 --> 06:16.591
I understand that you
don't trust us right now.

06:17.993 --> 06:19.949
But we want to find
your son's killer

06:19.950 --> 06:21.309
As badly as you do,

06:21.310 --> 06:24.765
And I promise you we
will do everything...

06:24.799 --> 06:28.935
Everything we can to find
the person who did this.

06:34.474 --> 06:36.142
Thank you.

06:37.744 --> 06:40.946
He was all I had.

06:44.201 --> 06:46.016
How much you know about cape v?

06:46.050 --> 06:48.816
You mean, do I have any special
insight because I'm black?

06:49.983 --> 06:52.381
Yeah.

06:52.415 --> 06:54.082
The gangbangers I've arrested

06:54.117 --> 06:56.851
Are usually somewhat suspicious
of white female cops.

06:56.885 --> 06:58.777
It's a pretty *** culture.

06:58.778 --> 07:00.900
Uh, not that I really know much.

07:00.901 --> 07:03.541
They think of themself as
more creole than black.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.191
This Mathias was a good kid.

07:07.226 --> 07:10.261
He's got no arrests, good grades.

07:10.294 --> 07:12.428
All right, let's
look at everything.

07:13.830 --> 07:15.698
Pull up sex offenders and
predators in the area,

07:15.732 --> 07:16.832
See if anything pops.

07:16.867 --> 07:17.833
Got it.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.441
That comment the...

07:19.442 --> 07:22.484
The mother made about the
devil getting into her son...

07:23.028 --> 07:24.108
Let's see if there's any tie

07:24.109 --> 07:26.274
To local gangs, devil worshipping.

07:26.308 --> 07:28.543
And we narrow it down
to, uh, skateboarders.

07:28.577 --> 07:32.212
Nice. I'll check with Bric.

07:32.247 --> 07:33.547
You seen Korsak?

07:33.581 --> 07:34.447
Coffee shop.

07:34.481 --> 07:36.014
Again?

07:37.885 --> 07:39.451
Hey, Korsak. Shh!

07:39.485 --> 07:40.852
Would you like coffee, Detective?

07:40.886 --> 07:41.920
Uh, no, thank you.

07:46.096 --> 07:47.096
Who's she?

07:48.331 --> 07:49.331
New.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.646
What are you doing here?

07:51.647 --> 07:54.222
Working... on my testimony
for the O'Reilly murder.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.003
I'm up tomorrow.

07:55.004 --> 07:56.835
Yeah, but why are
you working here?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.841
Uh...It was cold at my desk.

08:01.577 --> 08:03.720
All right.
How's the trial looking?

08:04.712 --> 08:07.046
Bunch of idiots on the
jury who watch too much TV.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.414
Waiting for the
presto-bango magic DNA.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.814
Yeah.

08:10.849 --> 08:13.049
Listen. You still got your
connection at family court?

08:13.084 --> 08:15.184
Okay, I got a juvie victim
named Mathias Senna.

08:15.219 --> 08:16.718
What do you need me for?

08:16.753 --> 08:18.721
Well, I need to know now what
is in that custody hearing.

08:18.755 --> 08:20.190
Oh, sure. I'm not doing anything.

08:20.225 --> 08:21.659
Thanks.

08:21.693 --> 08:23.194
And switch to decaf.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.938
Lungs are congested and heavy,

08:33.972 --> 08:35.905
But overall organs appear normal.

08:35.941 --> 08:37.941
So what's the cause of death here?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.076
I don't have one.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.611
Mees lines...

08:41.645 --> 08:43.851
Possible indicators of
toxins in his system.

08:43.852 --> 08:46.348
So he was poisoned? Mm. Doubtful.

08:46.383 --> 08:48.017
A few pinpoint
petechial hemorrhages

08:48.051 --> 08:49.218
Could indicate asphyxia.

08:49.252 --> 08:50.161
So he was suffocated.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.553
No airway obstruction
or external indication

08:52.588 --> 08:53.688
Of strangulation.

08:53.722 --> 08:56.657
Hello? Cause of death.

08:56.691 --> 08:58.758
Do you think lieutenant
Grant was sexy?

08:58.792 --> 09:01.193
You know, in a male kind of way?

09:01.930 --> 09:03.257
Do you like him?

09:03.258 --> 09:04.217
Not my type.

09:04.218 --> 09:07.431
You know, I'll do a tox screen
on arsenic and heavy metals...

09:07.466 --> 09:09.066
Both of which can
cause mees lines.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.934
You just said he
wasn't poisoned, Maura.

09:10.969 --> 09:11.969
I said it was doubtful,

09:12.003 --> 09:13.203
Based on the evidence.

09:13.237 --> 09:14.403
God, woman.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.407
Grant's a brass-kisser.

09:20.176 --> 09:21.339
Even when we were young,

09:21.340 --> 09:23.493
He had all the nuns wrapped
around his little finger.

09:23.494 --> 09:26.013
"Oh, I'll erase the board
for you, sister Mary pat."

09:28.314 --> 09:30.381
At recess, he would yell out,

09:30.416 --> 09:33.851
"Roly-poly Rizzoli eats cannoli."

09:33.886 --> 09:36.353
Oh, you were overweight?

09:36.388 --> 09:38.188
No. I was athletic.

09:38.223 --> 09:39.823
And strong.

09:39.857 --> 09:41.590
Maybe I was a little chubby.

09:41.591 --> 09:42.901
Why? What'd they call you?

09:44.028 --> 09:46.128
"Maura, the bore-a."

09:46.163 --> 09:47.296
you know.

09:47.330 --> 09:49.331
They meant "Boring,"
But it doesn't rhyme.

09:52.568 --> 09:53.802
Do you think maybe I was?

09:55.070 --> 09:56.404
What is that?

09:56.941 --> 09:59.273
Crime lab confirmed the
presence of candle wax.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.574
What? Hold your questions.

10:01.609 --> 10:03.343
These dark particles?

10:03.377 --> 10:04.877
Those are burned feathers.

10:04.912 --> 10:06.078
Okay, let me guess.

10:07.247 --> 10:10.216
He was smothered with
a burning down pillow

10:10.250 --> 10:12.351
While...He drank candle wax.

10:12.385 --> 10:13.452
No.

10:14.540 --> 10:17.008
Maura, I know it makes
you break out into hives

10:17.042 --> 10:18.105
If you have to guess,

10:18.106 --> 10:19.217
But I need a theory, okay?

10:19.218 --> 10:20.417
Just... just one.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.411
The medical evidence is consistent

10:22.412 --> 10:24.183
With what I would expect to find

10:24.184 --> 10:26.389
If the victim went
through an exorcism.

10:27.724 --> 10:29.258
He was killed by an exorcism?

10:29.292 --> 10:30.692
I didn't say that.

10:35.230 --> 10:38.431
The dad's not religious.
It's the mom's church.

10:38.466 --> 10:39.765
It's a storefront.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.167
Well, it may not
look like a church,

10:41.201 --> 10:43.037
But it's an urban crystallization

10:43.038 --> 10:45.303
Of a larger American pattern
of religious choice.

10:45.338 --> 10:46.405
Yeah.

10:46.439 --> 10:47.774
It's also a good scam.

10:47.808 --> 10:49.811
Even the drive-thru
chapels are tax-exempt.

10:49.846 --> 10:52.783
Well, commercial spaces
can still be sacred.

10:54.285 --> 10:55.618
This is the guy who runs it.

10:55.653 --> 10:57.920
Father Osorio Kokou,

10:57.955 --> 10:59.884
Leader of the Cidade Velha church.

10:59.885 --> 11:02.090
Born "Reginald Perry"...

11:02.125 --> 11:03.837
In and out of jail
since he was a kid.

11:03.838 --> 11:05.126
Robbery, assault.

11:05.161 --> 11:06.361
Oh, check fraud.

11:06.395 --> 11:09.329
Started his church
while he was on parole.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.297
So he's raking it in,

11:11.332 --> 11:13.632
Exorcism goes bad, he
dumps the boy's body.

11:13.666 --> 11:16.334
Excuse me. This is an
awful lot of speculation.

11:16.368 --> 11:18.235
It's a theory. It's different.

11:18.269 --> 11:21.437
Besides, who in this day and
age is performing exorcisms?

11:21.471 --> 11:23.914
Well, the catholic church has
been performing exorcisms

11:23.915 --> 11:26.473
Since the second century,
and they still do.

11:26.508 --> 11:29.709
It's an effective ritual
for expelling demons.

11:30.978 --> 11:32.978
Good to know.

11:35.482 --> 11:38.854
This is father Kokou, my priest.

11:38.888 --> 11:41.158
Hello. Jane: Hello.

11:41.192 --> 11:43.194
We're investigating
the death of Mathias.

11:43.228 --> 11:45.902
Did you perform an
exorcism on him?

11:46.610 --> 11:49.666
We performed purification
rituals on the boy.

11:49.700 --> 11:50.800
Yes.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.268
And did you "Purify" Him

11:52.302 --> 11:53.469
The night he disappeared?

11:53.503 --> 11:55.370
Father Kokou would
never hurt Mathias.

11:56.739 --> 11:58.640
He was helping.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.914
Exorcisms are very powerful.

12:07.949 --> 12:09.582
Is that what she said?

12:09.617 --> 12:11.184
No.

12:11.218 --> 12:12.732
Is that what you said?

12:12.733 --> 12:13.835
No.

12:13.836 --> 12:15.521
Maura.

12:15.555 --> 12:18.823
I...I said "
May God give his soul rest."

12:18.858 --> 12:21.425
And she thanked me by saying "
Stay in God's peace."

12:21.460 --> 12:24.190
We were fighting hard for Mathias.

12:24.191 --> 12:26.071
The devil was strong in him.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.732
And the devil killed him.

12:29.336 --> 12:31.537
See, we don't think
the devil killed him.

12:31.571 --> 12:34.573
We think Mathias may have
been killed by an exorcism.

12:34.607 --> 12:37.342
"Think." So you don't know.

12:37.376 --> 12:38.942
You're good, Reginald.

12:39.452 --> 12:40.667
We're not finished.

12:40.668 --> 12:42.679
Thanks for stopping by.

12:43.322 --> 12:44.961
This is a house in mourning.

12:44.962 --> 12:46.746
It's time for you to go.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.416
Beatrice, that's up to you.

12:50.886 --> 12:52.653
Please do as the priest said.

12:53.962 --> 12:56.590
The forces of evil are powerful.

12:57.206 --> 12:59.405
I can handle evil.

12:59.406 --> 13:01.107
Not this kind.

13:07.659 --> 13:09.537
È±

13:09.538 --> 13:11.393
I was disrespectful?

13:11.394 --> 13:13.628
Father "Cuckoo" Back there
is my number-one suspect.

13:13.663 --> 13:14.930
Father Kokou.

13:14.964 --> 13:16.731
Know, Maura. I was making a point.

13:16.766 --> 13:19.599
Well, "Kokou" is the most popular
boy's name with cape Verdeans.

13:19.634 --> 13:21.734
Okay, I don't need a
history lesson. Thank you.

13:21.769 --> 13:23.069
Very intriguing culture.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.371
Descendants from the
Portuguese explorers

13:25.405 --> 13:27.672
And slaves from the
Cape Verdean islands.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.773
I'm impressed!

13:28.807 --> 13:29.907
I can Google, too.

13:29.941 --> 13:32.043
And that father kokou...

13:32.078 --> 13:33.511
Or... or whatever is a phony.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.614
Did you check out that
poncho he was wearing?

13:35.648 --> 13:36.849
A grand boubou.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.049
I said I know.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.117
Oh, you knew?
What that robe was called?

13:41.453 --> 13:42.520
A "Boo-boo"?

13:42.554 --> 13:43.741
Well, it's popular

13:43.742 --> 13:45.490
With the Christians
in west Africa.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.625
Though the swahili in east Africa

13:49.360 --> 13:50.627
Like their boo-boos?

13:50.661 --> 13:51.761
Yes.

13:51.796 --> 13:52.929
That's not funny.

13:52.963 --> 13:54.296
Okay.

13:54.331 --> 13:56.798
Rizzoli.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.233
Okay, give me the address.

13:59.267 --> 14:01.001
Okay.

14:02.304 --> 14:03.770
I'll see you back at the ranch.

14:03.805 --> 14:05.338
I'm gonna go talk
to the boy's father.

14:05.372 --> 14:06.939
I'll get you a boubou.

14:06.974 --> 14:08.440
Whoo-hoo!

14:08.475 --> 14:09.908
A "Boo-boo"?

14:11.611 --> 14:13.712
I tried to get Matt
away from his mother

14:13.746 --> 14:15.381
And that crazy voodoo priest.

14:15.415 --> 14:16.983
I should have just taken him.

14:17.017 --> 14:18.484
Do you think that your ex-wife

14:18.518 --> 14:19.652
May have had anything to do

14:19.686 --> 14:20.920
With Mt's death?

14:20.954 --> 14:22.454
Not... not Beatrice. No.

14:22.489 --> 14:24.690
M-maybe the church.

14:24.724 --> 14:27.126
You did everything
you could, Malcolm.

14:28.072 --> 14:30.125
And my son is dead.

14:35.325 --> 14:37.158
When did your ex-wife
join the church?

14:38.828 --> 14:41.262
After the divorce.

14:41.296 --> 14:42.530
That priest is a crook.

14:42.565 --> 14:44.800
He got her to give
him all of her money,

14:44.834 --> 14:46.067
Even the child support.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.002
He spent every last
dime on lawyers,

14:48.036 --> 14:49.402
Fighting for custody.

14:49.437 --> 14:51.304
I mean, we even put off
having our own children...

14:51.339 --> 14:53.406
Alicia, I-I-I have
a child already.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.507
I know.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.709
I had.

14:58.578 --> 15:02.046
The judge was just about
to rule in our favor.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.909
We were gonna bring him home.

15:03.910 --> 15:05.949
Get settled, be a family.

15:24.232 --> 15:27.400
Dad's story checked out.
He was getting full custody.

15:27.434 --> 15:28.534
So maybe the mom killed him.

15:28.569 --> 15:30.135
Yeah, I'll e-mail the
whole file to you.

15:32.872 --> 15:35.974
Um, I'm guessing she's in the
waitress-protection program,

15:36.009 --> 15:37.509
And you're working here because...

15:37.543 --> 15:38.877
You're her new bodyguard.

15:38.910 --> 15:41.078
I'm working a case here,
Rizzoli, undercover.

15:41.112 --> 15:43.747
And you're undercover
to get her...

15:43.781 --> 15:45.848
Beans-to-water ratio?

15:47.083 --> 15:48.384
Someone's been
stealing from her till.

15:48.385 --> 15:49.627
I said I'd help her out.

15:49.628 --> 15:52.284
I have a fresh batch of
blondies, my mother's recipe.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.389
Do you want one?

15:54.498 --> 15:56.432
Don't want to insult your mother.

15:58.134 --> 16:01.869
I will insult your mother
if it keeps my ass smaller.

16:01.903 --> 16:03.803
I hear ya.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.874
How much is missing?

16:05.875 --> 16:08.742
$11.01 yesterday.
$14.99 the day before.

16:08.777 --> 16:10.695
Wow. 26 whole dollars.

16:10.696 --> 16:12.012
Now I understand why
you don't have the time

16:12.046 --> 16:13.313
To do homicide cases.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.447
Hey!

16:14.482 --> 16:15.482
I got a full load here!

16:15.516 --> 16:16.816
And I'm in the middle of a trial.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.317
You got time for blondies.

16:18.351 --> 16:20.051
Oh, you're gonna tell me again
how much you hate Grant?

16:21.845 --> 16:22.954
You don't keep your mouth shut,

16:22.955 --> 16:24.476
And I'll go tell her
how much you like her.

16:30.692 --> 16:32.265
This is a nasty custody battle.

16:32.266 --> 16:34.340
Mom and her church against dad.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.790
Something there?

16:35.791 --> 16:37.942
Maybe. What do you got?

16:37.943 --> 16:41.061
Tracking Matt's friends
and, uh, child predators.

16:41.062 --> 16:42.077
Okay.

16:42.814 --> 16:44.814
Jane!

16:44.849 --> 16:46.169
Hey, ma.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.826
Look who I found in the lobby.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.152
Well, you weren't
answering your phone,

16:50.186 --> 16:53.120
And the brand-new officer
O'Connor wouldn't let me up.

16:53.155 --> 16:55.021
All right. Well, I'll
talk to him. Thanks.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.223
Uh, hey, do you have
Matt's autopsy report?

16:57.257 --> 16:59.258
Yes, I'm waiting
on tox and micros,

16:59.292 --> 17:00.960
But I can tell you
this conclusively.

17:00.994 --> 17:02.895
It was not a natural death.
Really?

17:02.929 --> 17:05.530
You could knock me over
with a chicken feather.

17:06.464 --> 17:08.900
Uh, and what are you doing here?

17:08.934 --> 17:10.434
I, uh, brought you the dress

17:10.469 --> 17:12.269
That you're going to wear tomorrow

17:12.303 --> 17:13.611
When you come to dinner.

17:13.612 --> 17:15.471
It's just the solernos, mom.

17:15.506 --> 17:17.006
So? You cat look nice?

17:17.040 --> 17:19.608
Ooh. Look at this. Oh, wow.

17:19.642 --> 17:20.909
Look at the detailed
ottoman ribbing.

17:20.944 --> 17:24.145
Yeah, it's got that,
uh, Grecian v-neck.

17:24.179 --> 17:26.179
Oh, gorgeous woven-edge hem.

17:26.180 --> 17:27.481
Jane. Yeah.

17:27.516 --> 17:29.892
Um, listen, when you two are
done playing "Project runway,"

17:29.893 --> 17:30.628
I got work to do.

17:30.629 --> 17:32.117
I know you always forget to eat.

17:32.534 --> 17:33.957
Thank you.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.086
I love you. Love you.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.921
Well, look at that.

17:36.955 --> 17:39.089
Want some? Is it okay?

17:39.090 --> 17:40.314
Yeah. All right.

17:40.315 --> 17:41.521
Look at this.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.660
Oh. What is that white substance?

17:44.695 --> 17:45.828
Fluff.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.265
Light, downy particles of cotton?

17:50.883 --> 17:52.465
It's marshmallow.

17:53.135 --> 17:56.371
And the brown substance is
called peanut butter.

17:56.372 --> 18:01.143
It's ground-up, heavy,
oily particles of peanuts.

18:01.177 --> 18:04.012
What, they didn't have that
in your fancy boarding school?

18:04.046 --> 18:05.747
Oh, it's really good.

18:05.781 --> 18:08.082
Two hits on pedophiles
that like Matt's type...

18:08.117 --> 18:09.949
Both in custody
when he disappeared.

18:09.984 --> 18:12.249
All right, what about his
skateboarder friends?

18:12.284 --> 18:14.617
Gang unit says Matt was
hanging with some bad kids.

18:14.651 --> 18:15.917
Ran the names...

18:15.951 --> 18:16.846
They've all been brought up

18:16.847 --> 18:18.586
On minor drug
charges, except Matt.

18:18.620 --> 18:19.686
This is the gang leader.

18:21.055 --> 18:22.655
"Cruncha"?

18:22.690 --> 18:26.258
A.K.A. Jerome, 18...

18:26.292 --> 18:28.160
And the only adult.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.474
He recruits juveniles
on skateboards

18:30.475 --> 18:31.434
To run drugs for him?

18:31.435 --> 18:32.538
Maybe Matt said no.

18:32.572 --> 18:34.706
The origin of gang names is
actually quite fascinating.

18:34.740 --> 18:38.268
A nickname signifies a
change in status or identity.

18:38.269 --> 18:40.711
You're not a true member
until you have a nickname.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.646
Yo, Dr. Death.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.148
Jane-lo needs a cause of death,

18:45.182 --> 18:47.216
Not a seminar on
gangster nicknames.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.265
Maybe there's something to
what doc is saying. Thank you.

18:49.266 --> 18:50.387
If Matt had a nickname,

18:50.388 --> 18:52.293
Could mean he was
in Cruncha's gang.

18:52.294 --> 18:54.327
So maybe it's time
to talk to Cruncha.

18:54.361 --> 18:56.229
Yo.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.588
Do you know this guy?

19:10.622 --> 19:13.524
Yeah, that's, um, that's the
homie Ollie right there, man.

19:13.558 --> 19:14.591
We used to skate.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.359
So Ollie was Mathias' nickname?

19:16.393 --> 19:19.195
Yeah, he was, uh, he
was bad on the board.

19:19.229 --> 19:22.862
But, uh, I'm done
talking to five-oh's.

19:22.863 --> 19:24.551
So you can bother
someone else, dude.

19:24.552 --> 19:26.094
You mind, Jane?

19:26.095 --> 19:27.217
I, uh...

19:27.218 --> 19:29.019
Didn't make it to the gym today.

19:29.053 --> 19:30.754
Yeah, be my guest.

19:34.124 --> 19:35.958
Let me go! Let me go, poosh!

19:35.992 --> 19:36.992
Let me go!

19:38.028 --> 19:39.662
I'm not a dude. I'm a Detective.

19:39.696 --> 19:41.901
If you disrespect
that, I will hurt you!

19:41.902 --> 19:42.874
You got that?

19:43.298 --> 19:44.164
You got that?!

19:44.165 --> 19:45.367
Yes, I got it! I got it!

19:45.368 --> 19:47.001
Now, your boy got killed out here.

19:47.035 --> 19:48.268
Look, I ain't killed nobody, man.

19:48.303 --> 19:49.469
You go ask his mother!

19:49.503 --> 19:51.871
Crazy cape Verdeans and they -
they hexes!

19:51.905 --> 19:53.705
And... they... they evil, man!

19:53.740 --> 19:56.374
Them brothers and sisters at
that church are off the chain!

19:56.408 --> 19:58.343
So, just let me go, man!

19:58.377 --> 19:59.944
I didn't do nothin', man.

19:59.978 --> 20:01.879
Get out. Get out of here.

20:05.684 --> 20:07.651
So, what are you thinking?

20:07.685 --> 20:09.732
My gut says he's right.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.181
Church and the priest are evil,

20:11.182 --> 20:13.322
But it's not enough for a warrant.

20:13.356 --> 20:14.623
Nice move.

20:17.192 --> 20:19.560
Another set of micro and
tox reports came back...

20:19.594 --> 20:20.561
All negative.

20:21.014 --> 20:23.013
I could run tox
screens every day...

20:23.014 --> 20:24.325
Every day for the rest of my life

20:24.326 --> 20:26.160
And still not have
a cause of death.

20:26.194 --> 20:28.128
Gee, that's encouraging.

20:28.163 --> 20:30.531
All right, what about, um, herbs

20:30.532 --> 20:31.799
That they use in exorcisms?

20:31.800 --> 20:33.100
Can you run those?

20:33.134 --> 20:35.002
Yeah, already on it.
It'll be in the next screening.

20:35.036 --> 20:36.804
This is so frustrating.
This poor kid!

20:36.838 --> 20:38.305
Poor parents.

20:39.975 --> 20:41.041
What is it?

20:41.076 --> 20:42.543
Shh, shh, shh.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.837
I hate snakes.

21:26.673 --> 21:27.978
You can't take me off this case.

21:27.979 --> 21:29.322
I'm not taking you
off the case. Okay?

21:29.323 --> 21:30.990
But you can't ignore
a threat like that.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.791
It's a crazy priest and
some garden snakes!

21:32.825 --> 21:34.159
Come on! Yeah.
I understand what it...

21:34.193 --> 21:36.228
Hey, Jane, whoever did this
covered the security lens

21:36.262 --> 21:37.295
With spray paint.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.997
No prints. Nothing on the tape.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.098
Do exorcism priests tag?

21:42.133 --> 21:43.866
Hey. Hey! No jokes.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.235
Okay? This is a very dicey
political situation.

21:46.269 --> 21:48.970
We cannot be seen as persecuting
a priest or the church.

21:49.005 --> 21:50.205
What if he did it?

21:50.239 --> 21:51.472
Come on, Joe, is that
all you care about,

21:51.507 --> 21:53.074
Is how this is gonna
affect your career?!

21:53.108 --> 21:55.097
No, what I care about is you
going about this in a smart way

21:55.098 --> 21:56.260
So it sticks!

21:56.959 --> 21:58.096
So you believe me?

21:58.097 --> 21:59.129
Yes.

21:59.163 --> 22:01.030
Get kokou.

22:01.065 --> 22:02.365
Just be careful.

22:10.772 --> 22:13.373
Okay. Thank you.

22:13.408 --> 22:17.067
Yet another tox report
that came back negative.

22:17.068 --> 22:19.816
He didn't die from an herb
commonly used in exorcisms.

22:19.817 --> 22:22.362
Well, look for the uncommon ones.

22:22.363 --> 22:24.697
It's still thousands.
We have to narrow it down.

22:24.731 --> 22:26.065
Maura, I can't go
after that priest

22:26.099 --> 22:27.333
Until I know what Matt died of.

22:27.367 --> 22:28.500
Well, I'm not gonna guess.

22:28.535 --> 22:31.336
All right, well, what
if you were to guess?

22:31.370 --> 22:33.238
Just hypothetically guess.

22:33.272 --> 22:35.906
What would be your guess...

22:35.941 --> 22:37.574
Hypothetically?

22:40.812 --> 22:44.314
I found several cases of
people in the literature...

22:44.348 --> 22:46.248
Who were hexed to death.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.850
Murder by hex.

22:49.052 --> 22:50.285
All right, enough guessing.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.520
Well-documented cases.

22:51.554 --> 22:53.416
Victims who were so convinced
that they were cursed

22:53.417 --> 22:54.435
That they suffered

22:54.436 --> 22:56.591
Catastrophic
catecholamine-induced arrhythmia.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.392
I don't even know what that is.

22:58.426 --> 22:59.560
Heart attack.

22:59.594 --> 23:01.528
A heart attack because
they were scared?

23:01.562 --> 23:03.029
My kid didn't die of fear.

23:03.064 --> 23:04.530
Well...

23:04.565 --> 23:07.166
Haven't you ever been
afraid of anything?

23:08.901 --> 23:10.569
Uh...Witches.

23:11.504 --> 23:13.438
My family went to Salem
when I was little.

23:13.472 --> 23:14.972
See? You were very impressionable.

23:15.007 --> 23:16.740
Yes, I had to sleep
with a night-light.

23:16.775 --> 23:18.175
Why? What were you scared of?

23:19.810 --> 23:21.644
Chromobacterium violaceum.

23:21.679 --> 23:22.979
What's that?

23:23.013 --> 23:25.314
It's a flesh-eating bacteria.

23:25.348 --> 23:28.117
Crawls inside your
ear or your nose,

23:28.151 --> 23:29.485
And it starts eating
you from the in... okay.

23:29.519 --> 23:30.486
I-I got it.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.887
Thank you.

23:31.921 --> 23:33.955
It's horrible.

23:35.291 --> 23:38.626
Every culture has an
exorcism ceremony.

23:38.661 --> 23:40.161
You know, and there's no law

23:40.196 --> 23:42.897
Against being a charismatic
religious leader.

23:42.931 --> 23:45.199
Yeah, yeah, like Jim
Jones and kool-aid

23:45.233 --> 23:46.700
And David Koresh and Waco.

23:46.734 --> 23:47.934
What could go wrong?

23:50.237 --> 23:52.071
I feel like going to church. You?

23:57.977 --> 24:00.011
We're about to do a ceremony.

24:00.045 --> 24:02.513
I'm about to serve
a search warrant.

24:05.716 --> 24:09.319
This is a very disruptive way
to observe a foreign culture.

24:09.353 --> 24:11.786
Well, at least one
of us will fit in.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.962
You could have told
me you had a warrant.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.597
She didn't.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.965
We didn't have time.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.699
You lied?

24:29.734 --> 24:31.234
No.

24:31.268 --> 24:33.236
I said I was about
to serve a warrant.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.004
I didn't say when.

24:41.678 --> 24:44.379
Your rituals could seem
as strange to others

24:44.414 --> 24:45.547
As ours do to you.

24:45.581 --> 24:47.215
Blood into wine,

24:47.250 --> 24:48.883
Bread into flesh.

24:48.918 --> 24:50.785
He's right.

24:50.819 --> 24:53.287
It's no different
than the poteau-mitan,

24:53.322 --> 24:54.288
Linking heaven and hell.

24:54.323 --> 24:55.179
Is it?

24:55.180 --> 24:56.355
You know about the poteau-mitan?

24:56.390 --> 24:58.146
I spent two years in Dakar

24:58.147 --> 24:59.962
With themÃ©decins sans frontiere.

24:59.963 --> 25:01.490
You were in doctors
without borders?

25:01.525 --> 25:02.625
Mm-hmm.

25:02.659 --> 25:04.493
Why can't you just say that?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.800
Please.

25:12.835 --> 25:14.135
Let us complete the ceremony,

25:14.169 --> 25:15.669
Help sister Beatrice.

25:15.704 --> 25:17.804
Then you can do your search.

25:17.839 --> 25:19.172
Only if we can observe.

25:23.443 --> 25:24.643
If you wish.

25:36.315 --> 25:37.481
Don't worry.

25:37.482 --> 25:38.792
No. Why worry?

25:38.793 --> 25:40.760
We're just locked in
a room with an ex-con

25:40.794 --> 25:42.528
Who's about to do an exorcism.

25:42.562 --> 25:44.396
This is great.

26:08.183 --> 26:09.283
Snakes!

26:09.284 --> 26:09.881
Shh!

26:09.882 --> 26:12.219
Sna... shh!

26:42.944 --> 26:45.478
She believes the devil
that possessed her son

26:45.513 --> 26:47.480
Is inside of her.

26:49.950 --> 26:51.783
Think of an exorcism as a...

26:51.818 --> 26:55.486
As a massive therapeutic
intervention.

27:03.460 --> 27:04.493
Weapon.

27:04.528 --> 27:07.262
Passed from her
son's heart to her!

27:07.297 --> 27:08.830
Liberam!

27:08.865 --> 27:10.232
Liberam!

27:17.406 --> 27:18.806
Get everybody out the back! Go!

27:18.840 --> 27:20.908
Out of the back!
Let's go! Let's go!

27:24.378 --> 27:25.312
Stop!

27:40.106 --> 27:41.280
Where'd you get the sweatshirt?

27:41.281 --> 27:42.987
My homie Ollie gave it to me.

27:42.988 --> 27:44.488
Right before you put a
pillow over his head

27:44.522 --> 27:45.622
And smothered him to death?

27:45.656 --> 27:48.325
Look, I'm...
I'm a skater, not a killer.

27:48.359 --> 27:49.425
That's cute, Jerome.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.760
You just threw a Molotov
cocktail at a cop.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.795
You think you can scare
the cops off this case?

27:53.829 --> 27:55.763
With some snakes and firebomb?

27:55.798 --> 27:57.799
What are you talking
about snakes, man?

27:57.833 --> 27:59.600
Brother ain't messing
with no damn snakes.

27:59.634 --> 28:00.468
And the firebomb?

28:02.437 --> 28:04.805
Look, the voodoos killed Ollie.

28:06.708 --> 28:08.241
I want a lawyer.

28:10.335 --> 28:11.886
Okay, we're done.

28:15.382 --> 28:16.482
Take him to lockup.

28:21.554 --> 28:23.846
He has kids do petty crimes
to cover for his ass,

28:23.847 --> 28:25.256
But he throws a
revenge bomb himself?

28:25.290 --> 28:26.524
No. He didn't kill him.

28:26.558 --> 28:28.059
So you make the priest for it?

28:28.093 --> 28:30.027
Oh, big daddy voodoo
isn't saving souls.

28:30.062 --> 28:31.962
I haven't ruled out
the parents, either.

28:31.996 --> 28:34.264
Damn it. I am late for dinner.

28:34.298 --> 28:35.833
My mom's gonna kill me!

28:35.867 --> 28:37.236
You were firebombed, Jane.

28:37.270 --> 28:38.271
It's a good excuse!

28:38.305 --> 28:39.997
Yeah. You don't know my mother.

28:39.998 --> 28:41.644
Will you call her and
tell her I'm on my way?!

28:41.645 --> 28:42.270
Okay?!

28:42.271 --> 28:43.711
Yeah.

28:43.745 --> 28:45.512
Come on.

28:48.416 --> 28:49.783
Hi, ma. Hi!

28:49.817 --> 28:50.883
I'm sorry. Mm!

28:50.918 --> 28:53.569
No worries. Mwah!
I'm glad you're here.

28:53.570 --> 28:54.352
Like it? Yeah.

28:54.386 --> 28:55.452
Okay. Okay.

28:55.487 --> 28:56.854
Help me out? Go entertain. Okay.

28:56.888 --> 28:57.888
Okay, okay, okay.

29:01.223 --> 29:03.390
Rizzoli.

29:03.424 --> 29:04.991
Wow, you look amazing.

29:07.424 --> 29:09.458
Thank you.

29:11.228 --> 29:12.862
What the hell, ma?

29:12.896 --> 29:14.863
Where's pa and the solernos?

29:14.898 --> 29:17.799
They went to go pick
up ice cream for later!

29:19.568 --> 29:21.235
No, they didn't.

29:21.270 --> 29:22.903
There's no one else here?

29:22.938 --> 29:25.372
I made ragu bolognese.

29:25.406 --> 29:28.542
You made me wear this
dress for Joe Grant?!

29:28.576 --> 29:30.244
What? No!

29:30.278 --> 29:32.012
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:32.046 --> 29:32.846
Ma!

29:36.550 --> 29:38.751
I need to know
you're taken care of.

29:38.785 --> 29:40.819
By him?

29:40.853 --> 29:42.887
Are you kidding?! He's cute!

29:42.921 --> 29:44.455
He's not cute! He's very cute.

29:44.489 --> 29:45.255
So what?!

29:45.289 --> 29:46.056
Go! You go!

29:46.090 --> 29:47.023
Be a girl!

29:51.477 --> 29:52.932
I love you.

29:54.863 --> 29:58.425
So, I, uh, haven't
seen you in a dress

29:58.426 --> 30:00.425
Since, what, senior prom?

30:02.402 --> 30:04.267
With Charlie Krenz.

30:04.268 --> 30:05.312
He was a dork.

30:05.313 --> 30:06.714
Yeah, he was a dork.

30:06.748 --> 30:09.217
What, are you gonna tell
me I've filled out nicely?

30:09.251 --> 30:11.985
Uh, and risk being brought up
on, uh, harassment charges?

30:12.020 --> 30:13.720
Uh...Maybe.

30:15.289 --> 30:17.324
You look good.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.425
I had no idea she
was inviting you.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.427
She didn't invite me.
I broke in the window.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.896
Yeah, you always were funny. Yeah.

30:27.831 --> 30:29.264
Uh...

30:31.700 --> 30:32.666
Thank you.

30:32.701 --> 30:34.101
You're welcome.

30:35.051 --> 30:36.909
How did she convince
you to do this?

30:36.910 --> 30:37.909
Your mom? You kidding me?

30:37.910 --> 30:41.176
She, uh, she wouldn't
take no for an answer.

30:41.210 --> 30:43.612
She told me it was a
reunion or something.

30:43.646 --> 30:45.013
Yeah, apparently. Yeah.

30:45.047 --> 30:46.681
So, I, uh

30:46.715 --> 30:49.816
Heard about your little
incident at the church.

30:51.485 --> 30:52.903
You gonna write me up?

30:52.904 --> 30:53.944
Maybe.

30:54.266 --> 30:56.800
You gonna write me up,
uh, for harassment?

30:56.834 --> 30:57.934
Maybe.

30:57.968 --> 30:59.802
But you'd have to do it first.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.340
I think you look perfect.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.176
Thank you.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.013
Dinner's almost ready!

31:16.048 --> 31:17.181
Set the table, Jane!

31:17.215 --> 31:18.348
Okay!

31:19.584 --> 31:22.385
I can't believe my mother.

31:22.420 --> 31:23.720
Yeah. It's just the
two of us, right?

31:23.754 --> 31:25.054
Yeah.

31:25.089 --> 31:26.522
My mother still... Oh...

31:27.924 --> 31:29.324
Yeah.

31:29.359 --> 31:32.827
My mother still likes to tell me
when it's gonna rain outside.

31:32.861 --> 31:34.628
That's why I bring an
umbrella, you know?

31:34.662 --> 31:36.163
Yeah.

31:36.197 --> 31:37.200
No, no. She... you know,

31:37.201 --> 31:38.998
she just wants you to be happy.
That's all.

31:39.033 --> 31:41.167
Well, no offense, but I don't
need a guy to make me happy.

31:41.201 --> 31:42.868
And no one's proposing here, so...

31:42.903 --> 31:45.204
What's that supposed to mean?

31:53.544 --> 31:55.411
This is a bad idea, huh?

31:58.047 --> 31:59.847
Yes. Yes.

31:59.882 --> 32:01.248
It is a bad idea.

32:02.584 --> 32:04.017
All right. Well... Okay.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.052
Tell your mother I said hi.

32:05.086 --> 32:06.086
Tell her yourself.

32:13.058 --> 32:14.957
Why are you laughing?

32:14.992 --> 32:17.225
No, I mean, Se... do I look stupid?

32:18.260 --> 32:19.293
No. Are you kidding?

32:19.327 --> 32:20.794
Really, you don't know?

32:20.828 --> 32:23.295
You're gorgeous, my friend.

32:23.329 --> 32:24.930
Then why are you laughing?

32:24.964 --> 32:26.531
Really? Okay. Well...

32:26.565 --> 32:27.931
Tell my mother that.

32:27.966 --> 32:30.284
She thinks I'm some
sort of pity project.

32:30.285 --> 32:32.300
She just loves you. That's all.

32:32.335 --> 32:33.034
Mm.

32:33.069 --> 32:34.769
Want some cheese?

32:34.803 --> 32:36.403
No.

32:36.437 --> 32:39.205
Ew! No. Not out of
the dead fridge. No.

32:39.239 --> 32:40.606
If she loves me so much,

32:40.640 --> 32:42.574
Why did she hand me
off to that creep?

32:42.608 --> 32:44.942
I don't believe you
think he's a creep.

32:44.976 --> 32:46.210
Well, I do.

32:47.411 --> 32:49.079
I've known him since he was 5.
You know he used to lisp.

32:49.113 --> 32:51.114
So?

32:51.149 --> 32:52.482
"So"?

32:52.517 --> 32:54.451
You get rid of guys if
they have receding gums.

32:54.486 --> 32:56.653
That's true. That is true.

32:56.688 --> 32:59.155
But you're always complaining
that the guys you date

32:59.190 --> 33:00.925
Don't understand or like your job,

33:00.959 --> 33:01.959
And he respects you.

33:01.994 --> 33:02.880
Stop.

33:02.881 --> 33:03.481
Really.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.964
You think he's this
political animal,

33:04.965 --> 33:07.107
But it's just that
it comes out of him

33:07.108 --> 33:08.134
When he's around you

33:08.135 --> 33:09.614
Because he wants to impress you.

33:09.615 --> 33:10.981
It's mating behavior.

33:11.495 --> 33:12.924
I think it's sweet.

33:12.925 --> 33:14.492
I think you're insane.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.792
I'm off to solve a murder.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.627
Night-light on or off?

33:17.661 --> 33:19.261
On.

33:19.295 --> 33:21.095
I can't wait till
we solve this one.

35:25.236 --> 35:27.137
Thank you.

35:27.172 --> 35:28.539
It's in there.

35:29.180 --> 35:31.529
There are almost
always explanations

35:31.530 --> 35:32.874
For these phenomena.

35:32.908 --> 35:33.948
Almost?

35:36.949 --> 35:38.979
Well, maybe the dog
knocked the flowers over.

35:38.980 --> 35:40.880
Maura, it's four
feet off the floor.

35:40.915 --> 35:44.049
Hey, you know, maybe
ghosts are real.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.518
Maybe I could pick the winning
lottery numbers today.

35:46.552 --> 35:47.886
Maybe I am losing my mind.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.422
I could do a brain
scan if you like.

35:50.456 --> 35:51.989
Thank you. That's -
that's very helpful.

35:52.024 --> 35:53.590
Thanks.

35:54.725 --> 35:56.826
Can you run one more tox panel?

35:57.581 --> 35:58.928
Okay.

35:58.962 --> 36:00.797
What do you want me to look for?

36:00.831 --> 36:01.998
I can't even believe
I'm saying this.

36:02.032 --> 36:02.999
Okay?

36:03.033 --> 36:05.501
Purple poisonous plants.

36:05.535 --> 36:06.769
Purple?

36:06.803 --> 36:08.037
Yeah.

36:17.149 --> 36:20.172
You said that Mathias was
holding purple flowers. Yeah.

36:20.173 --> 36:22.081
Monkshood is a purple
flowering plant

36:22.115 --> 36:23.182
That grows in Boston.

36:23.216 --> 36:24.316
Is it poisonous?

36:24.350 --> 36:25.148
Yes.

36:25.149 --> 36:26.170
And it works very quickly,

36:26.171 --> 36:28.286
And it's extremely hard to detect.

36:28.321 --> 36:29.587
But I can try.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.661
Tox report on monkshood...
Positive.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.362
Low levels were detected,

36:38.396 --> 36:40.103
But enough to determine
the cause of death.

36:40.104 --> 36:41.598
Mathias was poisoned.

36:44.634 --> 36:46.168
I know why I had that dream,

36:46.202 --> 36:47.836
Because I know where I've
seen that plant before.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.704
Can you type the genetics of
the monkshood in Matt's body

36:50.738 --> 36:52.272
And match it to the
plant that it came from?

36:52.306 --> 36:53.806
No.

36:53.841 --> 36:55.808
Can you lie about that?

36:55.842 --> 36:57.676
No. I don't lie.

36:57.710 --> 36:59.601
Well, it's not a lie.

36:59.602 --> 37:00.345
Well, yes, it is.

37:00.379 --> 37:02.514
I know when it is.
I start to hyperventilate.

37:02.515 --> 37:03.815
Okay, it's a white lie.

37:03.850 --> 37:05.584
It's still a lie.

37:06.313 --> 37:07.591
You've never lied to a guy

37:07.592 --> 37:09.488
And tell him he was
good when he wasn't?

37:09.522 --> 37:10.923
No.

37:12.425 --> 37:14.126
Like this shirt with this jacket?

37:14.160 --> 37:15.928
Not really. No.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.901
We're sorry to tell you,
but your son was poisoned.

37:22.935 --> 37:25.069
What? H-how?

37:25.751 --> 37:29.807
Actually, with a...
A plant like this one right here.

37:29.841 --> 37:32.342
I didn't poison my son.

37:32.376 --> 37:33.844
That church.

37:33.878 --> 37:35.711
Beatrice's crazy church.

37:35.746 --> 37:37.680
That's how they did it.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.815
We don't think so.

37:39.849 --> 37:41.983
What's interesting is that, uh,

37:42.018 --> 37:45.520
Dr. Isles can type
the genetics of plants,

37:45.554 --> 37:47.855
Which means she can
match the monkshood

37:47.890 --> 37:49.690
That was found in Matt's body

37:49.724 --> 37:51.525
To the plant that it
originally came from.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.093
Isn't that right, Dr. Isles?

37:54.429 --> 37:56.529
Yes. We do do genetic typing.

37:56.564 --> 37:59.832
Basically, someone would just
have to soak the monkshood

37:59.866 --> 38:01.066
In a bottle of water.

38:01.100 --> 38:04.565
Find Matt on his skateboard.
Offer him a drink.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.666
That's right.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.166
This is crazy.

38:07.967 --> 38:11.203
If...If I may.

38:11.237 --> 38:14.176
Malcolm wouldn't have
a child with you.

38:14.177 --> 38:15.105
Is that right?

38:15.954 --> 38:17.756
Wait. H-how do you know that?

38:18.349 --> 38:20.155
It's in your custody papers.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.490
It's one of the reasons that
the judge gave you Matt.

38:22.524 --> 38:25.056
It's because of your
commitment to him.

38:25.091 --> 38:26.123
There you have it. Right?

38:26.158 --> 38:27.557
He didn't do it.

38:27.591 --> 38:30.291
Yeah, you... you didn't want
another child. You had Matt.

38:31.860 --> 38:34.428
But you wanted one of
your own, didn't you?

38:35.997 --> 38:38.364
You knew that Malcolm was
winning the custody battle.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.300
And you knew it was
never gonna happen.

38:41.301 --> 38:43.202
No.

38:44.337 --> 38:46.271
No.

38:46.851 --> 38:49.937
You knew about the exorcisms
because of the custody dispute,

38:49.938 --> 38:52.943
And you figured that the church
and his mom would be blamed.

38:57.848 --> 38:59.381
Malcolm.

39:01.050 --> 39:04.586
You know she never would have
stopped fighting for custody.

39:04.620 --> 39:06.888
And we would have spent all
our money on the lawyers,

39:06.922 --> 39:08.689
And it just was
trapping us in the past,

39:08.723 --> 39:11.967
And I swear, Malcolm, I
swear, I did it for us.

39:11.968 --> 39:13.034
No!

39:13.069 --> 39:14.135
No!

39:14.170 --> 39:15.603
Hey! Hey! No!

39:16.199 --> 39:17.832
Mr. Senna! Mr. Senna, okay!

39:17.867 --> 39:19.069
No! No! Come on! Mr. Senna!

39:19.070 --> 39:20.385
Malcolm, I'm sorry.

39:20.386 --> 39:21.425
Calm down.

39:24.371 --> 39:26.038
You have the right to remain silent.
Calm down, sir.

39:26.073 --> 39:28.374
Anything you say can and will
be held against you... Malcolm.

39:28.408 --> 39:29.775
...In a court of law.

39:29.809 --> 39:30.842
Malcolm.

39:52.094 --> 39:53.995
Your mother tell you
it was gonna rain?

39:54.029 --> 39:55.429
Naw.

39:55.464 --> 39:56.597
Yours?

39:56.631 --> 39:58.231
No.

40:01.602 --> 40:03.669
How long you been sitting here?

40:03.704 --> 40:04.670
You're soaked.

40:04.705 --> 40:07.039
Longer than I expected.

40:07.073 --> 40:09.407
I got to leave for D.C.

40:09.442 --> 40:10.423
Soon.

40:10.424 --> 40:12.703
Just wanted to come by and
see you before I left.

40:12.704 --> 40:14.103
Say bye if that's okay.

40:15.712 --> 40:17.214
What's in D.C.?

40:17.215 --> 40:19.683
Big job I wasn't expecting.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.618
What, they appoint you to the
supreme court or something?

40:22.653 --> 40:24.320
No.

40:24.354 --> 40:25.754
Not that big.

40:25.789 --> 40:28.156
They appointed me to be a liaison

40:28.190 --> 40:30.491
Between the city of Boston
and homeland security.

40:32.561 --> 40:35.095
Ah, that is big.

40:36.363 --> 40:38.463
Guess I'll be out
of your hair now.

40:40.633 --> 40:42.800
That's cool. I mean...

40:42.835 --> 40:43.833
You know...

40:43.834 --> 40:44.894
For you.

40:44.895 --> 40:46.207
Right.

40:49.841 --> 40:53.844
Sorry I called you "Frog face."

40:53.878 --> 40:57.080
What about "Roly-poly Rizzoli"?

40:57.114 --> 40:58.381
Yeah, that too.

41:00.049 --> 41:01.549
I liked you.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.887
Really? Yeah.

41:08.447 --> 41:11.489
For a long time.

41:11.523 --> 41:12.989
I mean, like...

41:13.024 --> 41:16.325
A really, really,
really long time.

41:39.944 --> 41:41.711
You're leaving.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.580
Yeah.

41:48.550 --> 41:51.717
Well, have fun in Washington.

41:53.486 --> 41:55.465
I'll miss you.
