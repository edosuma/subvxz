10:37.114 --> 10:40.552
UH, I HAVE A--I HAVE A LOT
ON MIND RIGHT NOW.

10:40.552 --> 10:43.077
UH, I DIDN'T REALLY WANNA COME
TO WORK TODAY,

10:43.077 --> 10:45.296
BUT MY GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE
AGENT LISBON

10:45.296 --> 10:47.472
TRICKED ME INTO MEETING YOU,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.344
KNOWING THAT
I COULDN'T REFUSE YOU

10:49.344 --> 10:51.607
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE AGE
MY DAUGHTER WOULD BE

10:51.607 --> 10:55.350
IF SHE WERE STILL ALIVE,
IF SHE HADN'T BEEN MURDERED.[gasps] OH, GOODNESS.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.613
MURDERED BY A MAN NAMED
RED JOHN,

10:57.613 --> 10:59.659
WHOM I MET WITH RECENTLY.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.270
HE SAVED MY LIFE
AND ABDUCTED A FRIEND OF MINE.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.186
LONG STORY.
HENCE, MANY THINGS ON MY MIND.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.361
[slurps]

11:06.361 --> 11:09.146
THAT'S NOT
A VERY FUNNY JOKE.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.713
HMM.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.759
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FRIEND?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.630
STILL MISSING.

11:14.630 --> 11:18.373
UH, PLEASE,
TELL US ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.158
HE WAS A GOOD PERSON.

11:21.158 --> 11:24.727
HE WAS... FUNNY

11:24.727 --> 11:27.208
AND... [voice breaks]
AND GENEROUS.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.733
AND I COULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT
ANYTHING, AND HE WOULD LISTEN.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.692
[Patricia] OH, YES,
HE COULD BE CHARMING.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.826
HE HAD HIS WAYS.

11:36.826 --> 11:40.395
WHAT KIND OF WAYS?HE HAD A TEMPER.

11:40.395 --> 11:44.312
THAT HE DID.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.706
I MEAN, HIS HEART WAS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE, YOU KNOW?

11:48.620 --> 11:51.188
WHATEVER HIS FAULTS,

11:51.188 --> 11:53.364
HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE
THIS WAY.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.325
REALLY, I'M IMPRESSED.

11:57.325 --> 12:00.937
YOU--YOU PLAYED ME LIKE A FISH
AND--AND YOU LIED TO ME.I KIND OF DID, DIDN'T I? SORRY.

12:00.937 --> 12:04.375
NO, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE
FINALLY LEARNING A FEW THINGS.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.335
OF COURSE, UH,
NOW I SHALL HAVE MY REVENGE.WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:07.335 --> 12:10.251
[chuckles] AHH.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.644
[Rigsby] DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE NOT HERE ABOUT DRUGS.

12:12.644 --> 12:15.125
WE'RE HERE ABOUT THE KILLING
THE OTHER NIGHT.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.084
[man] AH, YEAH, YEAH.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.608
KIDNAPPED A MAN, HUH?
THAT'S TOO BAD.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.958
LOCAL BEAT COPS SAY YOU GUYS
DO BUSINESS UNDER THAT BRIDGE.YEAH, LOOK,

12:21.958 --> 12:25.353
THE LOCAL BEAT COPS ARE NICE
GUYS, BUT THEY'RE OUT OF TOUCH.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.095
WE DON'T DO BUSINESS UNDER THAT
BRIDGE. THE HOS--THEY GOT DIBS.

12:28.095 --> 12:31.489
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA TALK
TO THE LADIES OVER ON FREMONT.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.970
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.YEAH, NO WORRIES.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.407
HEY, HEY, RED.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.627
YOU--YOU EVER DATE
A HUSTLER BEFORE?

12:38.627 --> 12:40.977
NOT SO FAR!

12:40.977 --> 12:43.240
WHAT? I'M KIDDING.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.768
THANK YOU.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.553
YEAH. OKAY.
GOOD TO KNOW.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.730
GOOD AFTERNOON. REID COLMAN. I'M
MR. DUBLIN'S PERSONAL LAWYER.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.472
GLAD TO SEE YOU PEOPLE.
YOU MADE ANY PROGRESS?

12:57.472 --> 13:01.258
EARLY DAYS, MR. COLMAN.YOU'LL, UH, NEED
TO TALK TO ME, YES?

13:01.258 --> 13:04.392
NOW'S A GOOD TIME.
I HAVE TEN MINUTES OR SO.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.525
IF YOU'LL COME THIS WAY,
WE CAN USE THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.571
UH, JUST A MOMENT.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.964
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

13:10.964 --> 13:12.966
MARJORIE.

13:12.966 --> 13:15.011
MARJORIE.
THAT'S A VERY NICE NAME.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.013
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO MARJORIE FIRST, THANKS.[sighs]

13:17.013 --> 13:19.973
UH, WE WILL NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOU IN DUE COURSE, SIR.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.931
I'LL, UH, TRY
AND FIT YOU IN LATER.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.977
PROSTITUTES? NO. NO.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.806
MR. DUBLIN WAS NOT
THAT SORT OF MAN AT ALL.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.720
THE ALLEYWAY
FROM WHICH HE WAS ABDUCTED

13:28.720 --> 13:30.418
WAS USED BY PROSTITUTES,

13:30.418 --> 13:33.334
AND IT WAS NOWHERE NEAR
MR. DUBLIN'S REGULAR ROUTE.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.162
I HAVE BEEN
MR. DUBLIN'S PERSONAL SECRETARY

13:35.162 --> 13:36.728
FOR TEN YEARS,

13:36.728 --> 13:39.470
AND I CAN TELL YOU
WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

13:39.470 --> 13:41.168
THAT HE IS

13:41.168 --> 13:43.910
THE MOST DECENT, CARING,
CLEAN, GENEROUS HUMAN BEING

13:43.910 --> 13:45.912
THAT ANYONE COULD HOPE
TO MEET.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.305
WE WANT TO BRING HIM BACK
SAFELY, MARJORIE.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.177
WE NEED
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.883
USUALLY I CAN GET AHOLD
OF HIM AT ANY TIME.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.494
HIS WORK DEMANDS IT,
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE,

14:03.494 --> 14:06.019
HE'D DISAPPEAR
FOR AN HOUR OR SO,

14:06.019 --> 14:08.804
NO--NO ANSWER FROM HIM
OR HIS DRIVER.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.502
HOW OFTEN WAS THAT?EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS.

14:11.502 --> 14:14.462
A REGULAR DATE RIGHT AROUND
THE TIME HE WAS ABDUCTED, YES?

14:16.551 --> 14:19.554
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK
HE MIGHT BE DOING?

14:19.554 --> 14:22.296
MISTRESS, I THOUGHT,

14:22.296 --> 14:23.863
BUT NOT THIS.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.823
MEN HAVE NEEDS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:27.823 --> 14:30.913
PLEASE, YOU'LL FIND HIM,
WON'T YOU? YOU'LL FIND HIM?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.437
MARJORIE, UH,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

14:33.437 --> 14:36.092
UH, IT'S VERY LIKELY
THAT HE'S ALREADY DEAD.

14:36.092 --> 14:39.617
WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:39.617 --> 14:43.012
IT'S A HUNCH THAT I HAVE,
AND IF I'M RIGHT,

14:43.012 --> 14:45.928
IT'S A BLESSING FOR YOU.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.670
UNREQUITED LOVE IS
A TERRIBLE THING.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.542
YOU HAVE TO FIND YOURSELF A MAN
THAT WILL LOVE YOU BACK.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.415
YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN. YOU
DESERVE IT. THINK ABOUT THAT.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.427
SO THIS WAS DONE BY SOMEONE WHO
KNEW ABOUT DUBLIN'S ROUTINE--

15:06.427 --> 15:07.863
SOMEONE VERY CLOSE.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.126
WH-WHY DID YOU SAY
HE WAS DEAD?

15:10.126 --> 15:12.520
BECAUSE HE IS. HE'S DEAD,
AND IT'S NOT A KIDNAPPING.GIVE ME A REASON.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.131
I'LL BET YOU
ALL THE TEA IN CHINA.[cell phone rings]

15:15.131 --> 15:17.481
[scoffs]
THAT IS NOT A REASON.I'LL GIVE YOU GOOD ODDS.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.483
[ring]HEY.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.877
HEY. RANSOM DEMAND
CAME THROUGH.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.531
HOW MUCH?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.446
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

15:25.446 --> 15:28.231
A MILLION DOLLARS FOR
THE SAFE RETURN OF DUBLIN--

15:28.231 --> 15:30.625
THAT KINDA SOUNDS LIKE
A KIDNAPPING, DOESN'T IT?

15:30.625 --> 15:33.715
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A KIDNAPPING.
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT DEAD.

15:33.715 --> 15:37.197
IS THIS A SERIOUS THEORY,
OR IS THIS YOUR REVENGE?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.819
[Cho] THIS WAS SENT
FROM A THROWAWAY PHONE.

15:50.819 --> 15:53.909
"DO EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED
OR H.D. GETS HIS THROAT CUT

15:53.909 --> 15:56.868
"AND WE SEND YOU HIS TONGUE.
WE WANT A MILLION DOLLARS

15:56.868 --> 15:59.393
"IN USED $50s AND $100s
AT 0600 TOMORROW.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.222
LOCATION WILL FOLLOW.
NO POLICE, OR H.D. IS DEAD."ANY PROOF OF LIFE?

16:02.222 --> 16:05.225
NO.HUH.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.184
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD
TO MRS. DUBLIN.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.447
THAT IS AN ORDER.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.015
JAWOHL, MEIN KOMMANDANT.CAN I SEE?YEAH.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.756
WHERE IS MRS. DUBLIN?

16:14.756 --> 16:17.759
YEAH, SHE CRIES A LOT. THEN SHE
HAS TO FRESHEN HER MAKEUP,

16:17.759 --> 16:19.804
AND THEN SHE CRIES AGAIN.
SORT OF A CYCLE.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.242
THREE
DELIBERATE MISSPELLINGS

16:22.242 --> 16:24.244
AND AN OBVIOUS
MILITARY LILT,

16:24.244 --> 16:26.420
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT
THE WRITER IS NOT A VETERAN

16:26.420 --> 16:29.466
BUT WANTS US TO BELIEVE
THAT HE OR SHE IS--

16:29.466 --> 16:32.382
SO A NOTCH OR TWO LESS CLEVER
THAN HE OR SHE THINKS

16:32.382 --> 16:34.776
THAT THEY ARE,
USING THIS CRIME TO EXPRESS

16:34.776 --> 16:38.432
SOME KIND
OF DEEP, PERSONAL GRUDGE.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.348
THE VIOLENCE IS
AUTHENTIC ENOUGH.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.958
OH, MY LORD. WHAT NOW?
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

16:42.958 --> 16:45.047
IT'S--IT'S NOTHING,
GISELLE.

16:45.047 --> 16:48.007
THESE ARE MY COLLEAGUES.
PLEASE REMAIN CALM.HOW CAN I REMAIN CALM?

16:48.007 --> 16:51.227
I CAN'T RAISE
A MILLION DOLLARS BY TOMORROW!

16:51.227 --> 16:55.362
WE AREN'T NEARLY AS RICH
AS PEOPLE THINK.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.365
WH-WHAT DO I DO?I CAN'T SPEAK TO
THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS, MA'AM.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.715
THAT'S YOUR CALL.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.935
NOW CAN YOU THINK
OF ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE HAD

17:03.935 --> 17:06.112
A PERSONAL GRUDGE
AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND?

17:06.112 --> 17:08.331
NO. NOBODY.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.725
MY HUSBAND IS A RESPECTED
AND BELOVED MEMBER

17:10.725 --> 17:12.596
OF SACRAMENTO SOCIETY.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.946
AND YOU?

17:14.946 --> 17:17.645
DO YOU RESPECT
AND BELOVEHIM?

17:17.645 --> 17:19.690
OF COURSE I DO.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.780
DEEPLY. WHAT A QUESTION.

17:22.780 --> 17:26.436
WELL, WH-WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO RAISE A MILLION DOLLARS

17:26.436 --> 17:29.352
TO SAVE HIS LIFE?WHY DO YOU ASK THAT? I DO!

17:29.352 --> 17:31.354
WELL, THE WATCH
AND THE EARRINGS--

17:31.354 --> 17:33.530
THAT'S, LIKE, QUARTER MIL
RIGHT THERE.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.750
YOU CAN RAISE THE MONEY.
YOU'RE CONFLICTED,

17:35.750 --> 17:38.753
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU WANT YOUR HUSBAND BACK.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.364
YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR HUSBAND
VERY MUCH AT ALL.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.323
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A VERY GOOD ACTRESS

17:43.323 --> 17:46.239
PLAYING THE PART
OF THE LOVING WIFE.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.284
THAT'S WHAT I THINK
YOU ARE.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.026
CAN YOU LOOK AT ME
AND TELL ME THAT I'M WRONG?

17:51.026 --> 17:54.073
[sighs]

17:55.726 --> 17:56.988
DUH.

17:59.556 --> 18:03.169
OF COURSE I DON'T LIKE HIM
VERY MUCH.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.562
EVERYBODY IN THE KNOW
KNOWS THAT HARVEY DUBLIN IS

18:05.562 --> 18:09.392
A MEAN, LYING, BACKSTABBING,
CROOKED SON OF A BITCH.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.829
BUT I'M HIS WIFE,

18:11.829 --> 18:15.311
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
BUT ACT LIKE I LOVE HIM?WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE HIM?

18:15.311 --> 18:17.879
[sighs] HAVE YOU EVER
DIVORCED A MEAN LAWYER?

18:17.879 --> 18:21.187
HE HAS NO RECORD
OF ANY PERSONAL WRONGDOING.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
HE'S A RESPECTED LOBBYIST.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.408
AN EXTORTIONIST AND CON MAN,
MORE LIKE IT.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.454
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

18:27.454 --> 18:30.457
WHO MAY HAVE WANTED
TO HARM YOUR HUSBAND.ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:30.457 --> 18:33.329
THERE'S PEOPLE ALL OVER THE CITY
PRAYING THAT HE STAYS GONE.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.897
HOW ABOUT YOU?ME?

18:35.897 --> 18:37.986
YEAH, YOU.

18:37.986 --> 18:41.511
OH, I'LL RAISE THE MONEY.
I OWE HIM THAT MUCH.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.557
I KNEW WHAT I WAS MARRYING.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.559
YES, MR. DUBLIN IS
THE TARGET OF SOME LAWSUITS.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.778
MOST PROMINENT MEN ARE
AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER

18:47.778 --> 18:51.347
IN THEIR CAREERS.
IT'S A HAZARD OF MODERN LIFE.

18:51.347 --> 18:54.133
SO HARVEY DUBLIN'S A SAINT.
THAT'S YOUR POSITION?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.352
NO, HARVEY DUBLIN IS NOT
A SAINT,

18:56.352 --> 18:58.267
BUT I'M HIS LAWYER,
AND I SPEAK FOR HIM.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.269
LOOK, HARVEY STARTED
WITH LESS THAN NOTHING.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.664
HE WAS A STREET KID.
HIS PARENTS WERE DRUG ADDICTS.

19:03.664 --> 19:07.102
HE LIVES IN FEAR OF FALLING
BACK INTO THAT WORLD,

19:07.102 --> 19:09.539
SO MAYBE HE PUSHES
A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD.

19:09.539 --> 19:12.020
MAYBE HE'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT TOO INTENSE

19:12.020 --> 19:15.458
IN HIS DESIRE TO WIN. THIS IS
AMERICA. THAT'S NO CRIME.SEVEN LAWSUITS PENDING.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.853
LOOK, ANYONE CAN GET SUED.
IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.377
HALF THE PLAYERS IN THIS TOWN
ARE IN BED WITH DUBLIN

19:21.377 --> 19:24.293
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
IN FACT, YOUR, UH,

19:24.293 --> 19:25.860
YOUR NEW DIRECTOR,
GALE BERTRAM--

19:25.860 --> 19:28.079
HE'S ONE OF HIS CODEFENDANTS.REALLY?

19:28.079 --> 19:29.907
YEAH. BANK OF CLAREMONT vs.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.518
BRIXHAM LAKE DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION AND OTHERS.

19:31.518 --> 19:34.477
IT'S GONNA BE A BLOCKBUSTER.DO GO ON.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.263
IT'S A COMPLEX
LAND/WATER RIGHTS THING.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.352
IT'LL RUN FOR YEARS.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.571
THE POINT IS,
BERTRAM WAS NAMED CODEFENDANT

19:41.571 --> 19:45.096
TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE DEFENSE
TO SETTLE EARLY.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.882
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.HMM. THAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT BERTRAM.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.058
NO, IT'S NOT.YES, IT IS.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.060
WHO'S TO GAIN THE MOST,
LEGALLY SPEAKING,

19:52.060 --> 19:54.062
IF MR. DUBLIN DOESN'T RETURN?

19:54.062 --> 19:56.282
WELL, THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S HARD TO SAY.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.284
TOO MANY VARIABLES
IN THE EQUATION.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.286
BUT HE IS COMING BACK,
RIGHT?

20:00.286 --> 20:02.636
I MEAN, IF GISELLE PAYS
THE KIDNAPPERS,

20:02.636 --> 20:04.681
WHY SHOULDN'T HE?WELL, STUFF HAPPENS.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.293
UH, DID YOU EVER SERVE
IN THE MILITARY, MR. COLMAN?

20:07.293 --> 20:11.210
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE
THAT HONOR. WHY DO YOU ASK?STANDARD QUESTION.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.602
[speaks inaudibly]

20:12.602 --> 20:14.169
WELL, HEY, DON'T JUST--

20:14.169 --> 20:15.649
[scoffs] OH, SHOOT.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.651
HEY, LADY, WAIT UP.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.522
MA'AM,
WE JUST WANT TO TALK.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.307
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

20:21.307 --> 20:24.179
YEAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. LISTEN,
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT GUY

20:24.179 --> 20:27.487
THAT WAS KIDNAPPED UP THE STREET
A COUPLE BLOCKS OVER?

20:27.487 --> 20:30.403
HIS DRIVER WAS SHOT DEAD.OH, THAT. YEAH. ISN'T THAT WILD?
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT.

20:30.403 --> 20:34.363
WHAT EXACTLY ARE PEOPLE SAYING?ALL KINDS OF STUFF. FRIEND
OF MINE SAID SHE WAS THERE.

20:34.363 --> 20:37.279
OH, YEAH?WELL, SHE'S ACTING
ALL MYSTERIOUS,

20:37.279 --> 20:40.413
LIKE, "I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED,"

20:40.413 --> 20:44.112
LIKE SHE'S A SECRET AGENT
OR WHATNOT.WHAT'S YOUR FRIEND'S NAME?

20:44.112 --> 20:47.463
YOURS FOR $50.THIS IS
A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.336
WE COULD TAKE YOU IN
RIGHT NOW FOR OBSTRUCTION.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.295
OH, BABY, SAVE YOURSELF
TIME AND PAPERWORK.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.385
I GOT 40... 43 BUCKS.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.042
UH... 12 CENTS.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.610
MONEY'S TIGHT ALL OVER, HUH?

21:03.610 --> 21:06.569
COME ON.
CUT US A BREAK HERE.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.403
SUGAR--BIG OLE TALL GIRL,
PINK HAIR.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.449
SHE'LL BE AROUND TOMORROW NIGHT.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.973
NICE DOIN' BUSINESS WITH YA.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.367
12 CENTS? SERIOUSLY?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.325
WHAT? [sighs]
SHE CLEANED ME OUT.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.153
[chuckles] 12 CENTS.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.464
AH.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.509
INTERESTING
ABOUT BERTRAM, HUH?

21:33.509 --> 21:36.512
YOU SAID THAT BEFORE.
NO, IT'S NOT.

21:36.512 --> 21:39.907
I GOT A WEIRD VIBE
THE FIRST MOMENT I MET HIM.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.475
UH, THE DIRECTOR OF
THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

21:42.475 --> 21:44.781
DID NOT KIDNAP
HARVEY DUBLIN.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.827
SO YOU THINK.
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HIM?

21:46.827 --> 21:48.829
THIS IS YOUR REVENGE,
ISN'T IT?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.918
WELL, I-I AM SIMPLY
GONNA IGNORE YOU.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.442
I'M NOT PUNISHING YOU,
THOUGH YOU DO DESERVE IT.

21:53.442 --> 21:57.490
DUBLIN TURNED OUT TO BE
THE SLEAZEBAG I GUESSED HE WAS.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.144
HE DESERVES JUSTICE
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.451
OH, YOU'RE A COP.
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.453
YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE IT.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.325
MY FINGERS ARE IN MY EARS.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.396
MORNING!

22:34.396 --> 22:37.094
HEY!

22:37.094 --> 22:38.835
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

22:38.835 --> 22:41.925
NOTHING YET.NO KIDDING.
WHERE'S THE MONEY?

22:41.925 --> 22:44.232
TRASH CAN DOWN THERE.THERE?

22:44.232 --> 22:45.886
YEAH.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.932
OH. JUST AS I THOUGHT.
NO ONE'S GONNA SHOW UP.

22:48.932 --> 22:52.371
LOOK AT THIS PLACE. IT'S FAR
TOO OPEN FOR A RANSOM DROP.WELL, THEY SAID NO POLICE,

22:52.371 --> 22:55.461
AND MAYBE THEY'RE STUPID ENOUGH
TO THINK THAT THERE'S NO POLICE.

22:55.461 --> 22:58.028
THEY KILLED A GUY
IN THE STREET.

22:58.028 --> 23:01.249
THEY HAVE TO KNOW
THE POLICE ARE INVOLVED. [sighs]

23:01.249 --> 23:03.599
THEY NEVER INTENDED
TO PICK UP THE RANSOM.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.906
WELL, MY HUNCH IS CORRECT.
THE KIDNAPPING'S A SHAM.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.604
DUBLIN'S ALREADY DEAD.WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON
FOR A PRETEND KIDNAPPING?

23:08.604 --> 23:10.606
WELL, THAT IS
THE SALIENT QUESTION, YES.

23:10.606 --> 23:14.175
BUT YOU CAN STOP WASTING
YOUR TIME HERE, CERTAINLY.

23:14.175 --> 23:17.961
HEY, DID MRS. DUBLIN
USE REAL MONEY OR FAKE MONEY?REAL.

23:17.961 --> 23:21.138
DID YOU LOOK AT IT?NO. WHAT WOULD
THAT MATTER NOW?

23:21.138 --> 23:22.749
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:22.749 --> 23:25.273
I'M--YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS.

23:25.273 --> 23:28.276
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING MIGHT BE
TRUE AND IT MIGHT NOT BE.

23:28.276 --> 23:31.322
WE STILL HAVE TO SIT ON
THIS THING FOR A LITTLE WHILE

23:31.322 --> 23:34.630
TO MAKE SURE NOBODY
SHOWS UP--COUPLE OF HOURS.WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.416
IT'S NOT SILLY.
IT'S PROFESSIONAL.PROFESSIONAL SH-MESSIONAL.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.418
JANE.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.301
[clatters]

23:53.301 --> 23:55.695
HEY, IT'S REAL!

23:55.695 --> 23:58.393
POLICE! FREEZE!
HANDS IN THE AIR!

23:58.393 --> 24:02.136
GET ON YOUR KNEES!
DO IT NOW! DO IT NOW!OKAY.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.268
DON'T MOVE.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.929
[man]
THE DIRECTOR IS EXPECTING

24:12.929 --> 24:15.932
A FULL BUT CONCISE
PROGRESS REPORT.HOW'S THAT JACKET SMELL?

24:15.932 --> 24:18.979
THIS IS A DIFFERENT SUIT.YEAH, BUT THE OTHER ONE'S
RUINED, ISN'T IT? HMM?

24:18.979 --> 24:20.371
POWER OF SUGGESTION.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.678
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BITE ME.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.687
SO...
POOR HARVEY DUBLIN, HUH?

24:31.687 --> 24:34.516
SIR, NO ONE PICKED UP
THE RANSOM DROP,

24:34.516 --> 24:36.475
SO FOR THAT
AND OTHER REASONS,

24:36.475 --> 24:38.128
WE BELIEVE THAT

24:38.128 --> 24:40.130
THE KIDNAPPING ASPECT
OF THIS CASE IS A PRETENSE.

24:40.130 --> 24:43.090
MASKING WHAT?THAT WE CAN'T SAY FOR SURE.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.875
WE HAVE PROMISING LEADS.WELL, I NEED SOMETHING
TO TELL THE MEDIA.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.790
TELL 'EM
HARVEY DUBLIN'S DEAD.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.967
WELL, I'M SO GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO WORK ON THIS CASE, MR. JANE.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.926
YOUR DIRECTNESS IS BRACING.

24:52.926 --> 24:56.320
OF COURSE, PROCEDURALLY,
WE'RE STILL ASSUMING HE'S ALIVE,

24:56.320 --> 24:58.932
UNTIL WE HAVE
PROOF POSITIVE OTHERWISE.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.543
WHY KILL DUBLIN?
WH-WHAT'S THE MOTIVE?

25:01.543 --> 25:03.545
WELL, TWO POSSIBILITIES.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.504
UH, ONE--SIMPLE ROBBERY.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.854
THE CULPRIT WAS GOING
AFTER THE DIAMOND THAT, UH,

25:07.854 --> 25:10.509
DUBLIN ALWAYS CARRIES ON HIM.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.728
[chuckles]
DIAMOND? WHAT DIAMOND?

25:12.728 --> 25:14.730
WELL, APPARENTLY,
DUBLIN HAD A TERROR

25:14.730 --> 25:16.993
OF FALLING BACK
INTO POVERTY, OF, UH,

25:16.993 --> 25:19.605
DYING IN A PAUPER'S GRAVE
LIKE HIS FATHER DID,

25:19.605 --> 25:21.563
SO HE ALWAYS CARRIED
A LARGE DIAMOND WITH HIM,

25:21.563 --> 25:23.173
JUST IN CASE.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.828
IT'S KIND OF
A TOUCHING STORY, ISN'T IT?

25:25.828 --> 25:27.830
SO SOMEONE STAGED
THIS ABDUCTION

25:27.830 --> 25:30.703
TO STEAL THE DIAMOND.

25:30.703 --> 25:33.532
OKAY. UM, WHERE'S
YOUR EVIDENCE FOR THIS?WELL, NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.883
THAT'S--THAT'S WORD
ON THE STREET.IT'S MORE LIKE A THEORY,
REALLY.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.799
WORD ON THE STREET.JANE.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.410
SO YOU HAVE NOTHING?

25:43.933 --> 25:46.588
YOU--YOU SAID THERE WERE
TWO POSSIBILITIES?

25:46.588 --> 25:49.286
OH, THE OTHER REASON
SOMEONE WOULD KILL HIM IS,

25:49.286 --> 25:51.637
UH... B-B-B-BRIXHAM LAKE.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.553
UH, WAIT A SECOND.WHAT ABOUT BRIXHAM LAKE?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.903
WELL, IT'S SUCH
A COMPLEX LITTLE SCANDAL,

25:56.903 --> 25:58.513
ISN'T IT?

25:58.513 --> 26:01.516
AND IT ALL GOES AWAY
IF HARVEY DUBLIN IS DEAD.

26:01.516 --> 26:05.651
I AM A NAMED CODEFENDANT IN ONE
OF THE BRIXHAM LAKE LAWSUITS.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.522
YES, I SAW THAT.
VERY INTERESTING.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.132
UH, OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE INNOCENT,

26:09.132 --> 26:12.875
BUT, UH, I IMAGINE
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF

26:12.875 --> 26:14.877
THAT YOU WOULD RATHER
REMAIN SECRET

26:14.877 --> 26:17.445
THAT WILL COME OUT
IF THE SUIT GOES TO TRIAL.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.316
YOU HAD AMPLE MOTIVE.

26:19.316 --> 26:22.319
SO THAT'SOPTION TWO?

26:22.319 --> 26:24.495
ME? I'M YOUR SUSPECT?

26:24.495 --> 26:27.063
WHA-- [chuckles]
WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING AT?

26:27.063 --> 26:29.109
WELL, I W--
I WAS JUST WONDERING

26:29.109 --> 26:32.112
WHY YOU DIDN'T TELL US
THIS GUY WAS SUCH A SLEAZEBAG

26:32.112 --> 26:35.028
AND THAT YOU ARE UP TO YOUR NECK
IN HIS GRUBBY BUSINESS.THAT'S ENOUGH.

26:35.028 --> 26:38.074
YES, IT IS.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

26:38.074 --> 26:41.382
YOU SHALL JUST HAVE TO TRUST
IN MY INNOCENCE, MR. JANE.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.340
I'M NOT GOOD AT TRUST.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.343
I'M REALLY TRYING
TO ALLOW YOU THE LATITUDE

26:46.343 --> 26:48.345
THAT
YOUR RARE TALENTS DESERVE,

26:48.345 --> 26:50.783
BUT YOU MAKE IT
VERY DIFFICULT.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.524
YOU TWO MAY GO NOW.
HIGHTOWER, STAY.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.048
YES, SIR.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.884
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
ARE YOU INSANE?

27:04.884 --> 27:07.887
AND WHERE DID YOU COME UP WITH
THAT STUPID-ASS DIAMOND STORY?

27:07.887 --> 27:10.672
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.
I SEE THAT MAN,

27:10.672 --> 27:12.892
I GET AN IMMEDIATE URGE
TO WIND HIM UP.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.676
HE'S THE DIRECTOR.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.679
I'M SORRY. HE AMUSES ME.I'M GLAD HE ENTERTAINS YOU,

27:17.679 --> 27:20.290
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA FIRE YOU
NOW PROBABLY.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.510
NO. YOU GUYS NEED ME
TOO MUCH.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.164
[speaks inaudibly]

27:24.164 --> 27:27.689
I'LL CATCH UP.

27:27.689 --> 27:32.302
[speaks indistinctly]

27:32.302 --> 27:33.695
EXCUSE ME?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.741
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

27:35.741 --> 27:37.743
I WAS COMPLIMENTING HER
ON HER JACKET.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.093
IT'S SUCH A VIVID COLOR.LIAR.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.095
YOU'RE GONNA CALL ME
A LIAR?

27:42.095 --> 27:44.097
OH, I HATE YOU.OH.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.533
I DO.MNH-MNH.

27:45.533 --> 27:49.929
WE HAVE OUR BEST PEOPLE
ON THIS THING 24/7.

27:49.929 --> 27:53.628
I WANT TO EXTEND MY SYMPATHIES
TO THE FAMILY OF PETER RUSSO,

27:53.628 --> 27:55.978
AND--AND PLEASE JOIN US
IN OUR PRAYERS

27:55.978 --> 27:58.024
FOR MR. DUBLIN'S SAFETY.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.200
ARE THERE QUESTIONS--
BRIEFLY, PLEASE?

28:00.200 --> 28:03.377
YEAH. ARE YOU LOOKING INTO THIS
BEING A SEX-RELATED CRIME MAYBE?

28:03.377 --> 28:06.380
I MEAN, THAT ALLEYWAY IS--NO, THERE'S NO SEX ANGLE, JEFF--
NONE THAT WE'RE AWARE OF.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.731
SIR, DO YOU THINK THERE'S
A BRIXHAM LAKE CONNECTION HERE?

28:09.731 --> 28:13.300
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.BUT BOTH YOU AND DUBLIN ARE
INVOLVED IN THAT CASE,

28:13.300 --> 28:16.259
AREN'T YOU?NO, NO, NO.
WH-WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS,

28:16.259 --> 28:19.132
IT SEEMS
THAT MR. DUBLIN WAS RUMORED

28:19.132 --> 28:22.091
TO KEEP A LARGE DIAMOND
WITH HIM, ON--ON HIS PERSON,

28:22.091 --> 28:24.920
AND THE THEFT OF THAT DIAMOND IS
OUR CURRENT LINE OF THINKING

28:24.920 --> 28:26.443
AS TO MOTIVE.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.750
[Jeff] YEAH? WHAT KIND
OF DIAMOND IS IT?

28:28.750 --> 28:31.274
UH, BIG.
IT'S 2 OR 3 CARATS, I THINK.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.407
[scoffs] WHY WOULD HE CARRY
A DIAMOND LIKE THAT

28:33.407 --> 28:36.366
AROUND WITH HIM? WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION, JEFF.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.717
UH, PERHAPS MR. DUBLIN
WAS TRYING TO BE PREPARED

28:38.717 --> 28:39.848
FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.545
YOU KNOW...

28:41.545 --> 28:43.504
[turns TV on] ...UNDERSTANDABLE, ISN'T IT?

28:43.504 --> 28:46.246
I MEAN,
HE'S, UH, HAD A TOUGH...[clicks switch]

28:46.246 --> 28:48.335
[turns TV on] JUST ONE MORE QUESTION...

28:48.335 --> 28:50.337
[clicks switch]

28:50.337 --> 28:52.513
[telephone ringing in distance]

28:52.513 --> 28:55.516
HOW DO YOU THINK
THE DIRECTOR IS GOING TO FEEL

28:55.516 --> 28:57.518
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
YOU FOOLED HIM

28:57.518 --> 29:00.477
INTO TALKING
COMPLETE GARBAGE ON TV?IT'S NOT GARBAGE,

29:00.477 --> 29:02.479
AND HE'LL BE VERY ANGRY
OR VERY HAPPY,

29:02.479 --> 29:05.091
DEPENDING ON
WHETHER I'M RIGHT OR NOT.

29:05.091 --> 29:08.485
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?
THERE IS NO DIAMOND--

29:08.485 --> 29:12.098
OH. I SEE. A TRAP.
VERY CLEVER.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.621
MM.A TRAP FOR WHO?

29:13.621 --> 29:15.579
GUESS.JUST TELL ME.

29:15.579 --> 29:18.495
GUESS.YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW YOU.
YOU CROSSED A LINE ALREADY,

29:18.495 --> 29:20.497
AND NOW YOU'RE PLAYING
GUESSING GAMES WITH ME?

29:20.497 --> 29:22.978
NO, IT'S JUST THAT
I'M NOT SURE MYSELF.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.372
I HAVE A PLAN, THOUGH.OH, SHEEPDIP.

29:25.372 --> 29:29.028
YOU ARE STILL TRYING TO
PUNISH ME FOR LYING TO YOU.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.073
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY. SORRY.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.684
YOU WANTED OFF THIS CASE.
YOU'RE OFF.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.686
YOU CAN TAKE A NAP
IN YOUR THINKING ROOM.

29:35.686 --> 29:38.037
WE'LL SOLVE THIS CASE
WITHOUT YOU, THE RIGHT WAY--

29:38.037 --> 29:40.604
WITH
GOOD, SOLID DETECTIVE WORK.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.782
SO I TAKE IT YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR MY PLAN?

29:43.782 --> 29:47.176
"NO, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR YOUR PLAN."

29:47.176 --> 29:49.744
"SHEEPDIP YOUR PLAN."

29:56.751 --> 29:58.405
[speaks indistinctly]

29:58.405 --> 30:00.755
HI, LADIES.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.148
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SUGAR.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.280
NO SUGAR. JUST CANDY.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.629
YOU'RE NOT SUGAR?

30:05.629 --> 30:08.067
NO, MA'AM. EXCUSE ME.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.069
YEAH, WELL,
WE KINDA THINK YOU ARE.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.114
YEAH, WELL,
THINKING'S FREE, FLACO.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.116
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO COME
WITH US, SUGAR.

30:14.116 --> 30:16.075
WHAT FOR?BECAUSE YOU SAW
WHAT HAPPENED

30:16.075 --> 30:18.120
IN THAT ALLEYWAY
OVER ON FREMONT.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.122
NAH, I WAS JUST PLAYING.
I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.821
OKAY, STILL,
WE'D LIKE FOR YOU--HEY! [grunts]

30:22.821 --> 30:25.432
OH! [grunts]

30:25.432 --> 30:27.564
[grunts]

30:27.564 --> 30:30.089
AAH! AAH!

30:32.482 --> 30:34.528
[sighs] OKAY.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.182
[sniffles] OHH.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.574
HERE.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.489
[inhales sharply] OHH.

30:41.883 --> 30:44.581
OHH.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.540
[whispers] THANKS.
