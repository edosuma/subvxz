00:38.421 --> 00:40.476
while everybody else
is taking a fun day?

00:40.554 --> 00:43.007
He's buried in Nick
Fury's paperwork canyon.

00:43.132 --> 00:44.381
Fury's currently gone missing,

00:44.500 --> 00:46.390
and probably not to golf in Hawaii.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.382

It is forbidden for humans
to enter Inhuman cities.

It's also forbidden for
Inhumans to return to Atarog.

I see all possible futures,
all the probabilities.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.670
This is very bad.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.538
The more of these
defenses we activate,

11:01.595 --> 11:04.699
the more likely the Royal Family
will be alerted to our presence.

11:04.801 --> 11:06.442
We're not leaving
without Fury.

11:06.512 --> 11:08.668
And I want
that explanation, now.

11:08.746 --> 11:10.426
(SIGHS) Okay.

11:10.512 --> 11:13.496
Nick discovered my powers when
I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:13.598 --> 11:16.262
And since then,
I've been his secret asset.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.710
But then Hydra
found out about me, and...

11:18.819 --> 11:19.765
Wait.

11:19.827 --> 11:21.965
Are you saying Zola
didn't attack the Triskelion

11:22.015 --> 11:23.458
just to take over
the world?

11:23.520 --> 11:24.849
He wanted me.

11:24.903 --> 11:26.919
So Nova and Nick
had to get me out.

11:26.997 --> 11:29.348
They've been protecting me
from Hydra ever since.

11:29.395 --> 11:32.012
I'm gonna need some proof before
I can just take your word for it.

11:32.114 --> 11:33.762
You could be a Hydra plant.

11:33.817 --> 11:37.223
There was an 83% chance
you'd demand proof.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.137
It's 100% now.

11:39.309 --> 11:40.442
Very well.

11:40.512 --> 11:42.823
This is the Web of Reality.

11:42.926 --> 11:44.903
TRITON:
By the Mists...

11:45.075 --> 11:47.926
MADAME WEB: Every reality,
every possible future,

11:48.075 --> 11:49.192
I see them all,

11:49.260 --> 11:51.762
judging which is most likely
to come to pass.

11:52.005 --> 11:53.978
Is that Doc Ock
as a good guy?

11:54.122 --> 11:55.895
Doubt that's
a high probability.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.149
Okay, I think
I believe you.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.878
This is how I knew
which keys to put in the box.

12:00.956 --> 12:02.120
So where's Fury?

12:02.183 --> 12:04.112
We need to get
him out now.

12:04.237 --> 12:06.057
There's a 98% probability

12:06.103 --> 12:07.896
that door will
explode if opened.

12:08.013 --> 12:09.561
SPIDER-MAN:
I'll take that bet.

12:09.733 --> 12:10.662

knowing the future,

12:14.735 --> 12:16.170
and Triton reading
the Inhuman graffiti,

12:16.248 --> 12:17.733
rescuing Nick'll be cake.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.346
There's nothing easy
about my predictions.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.835
It's always possible
I've missed something.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.554
Remember that when
you deal with Crossbones.

12:25.663 --> 12:28.141
Crossbones?  Who said
anything about Cross...

12:28.187 --> 12:29.359

(BOTH SCREAM)

12:29.426 --> 12:30.582

12:37.838 --> 12:39.588

Are you okay?

12:39.635 --> 12:41.830
Do I look okay,
Spider-Man?

12:41.955 --> 12:43.463
I'll make this simple.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.182
Hand over Madame Web,

12:45.252 --> 12:48.197
or Nick Fury never
sees the sun again.

12:48.549 --> 12:51.502
Okay, this is a good news,
bad news thing.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.858
Good news,
we finally found Fury.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.272
But Crossbones, a mercenary
working for Hydra, is all bad news.

12:56.366 --> 12:58.226
is all bad news.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.767
Tick-tock, kids.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.046
This offer to trade
Fury for Madame Web

13:02.093 --> 13:04.116
only lasts till I get bored.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.343
Any chance there's
a third option?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.483
Yes, no? Maybe?

13:08.588 --> 13:10.483
Okay, guess not.

13:12.108 --> 13:13.788
CROSSBONES:
Time's up, kid.

13:13.936 --> 13:15.202
What's it gonna be?

13:15.327 --> 13:17.030
Fury or Web?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.772
Is "all of the above"
an option?

13:18.905 --> 13:20.319
Catch me if you can!

13:20.390 --> 13:21.788
(GRUNTING)

13:27.997 --> 13:29.108
Yah!

13:32.007 --> 13:33.819
Solid strategy,
Spider-Man,

13:33.897 --> 13:35.788
getting Hydra
to blast me free.

13:35.874 --> 13:38.186
Yeah, sure, that was
totally my plan.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.569
Now let's get you
out of here.

13:39.624 --> 13:42.108
Forget me.
Save Madame Web.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.499
But you always said
never leave a man behind.

13:44.568 --> 13:47.525
After I told you to always
follow my orders.

13:47.657 --> 13:49.649
Go.

14:11.881 --> 14:12.960
Come on!

14:14.920 --> 14:17.530
Thank you for saving us.
Now we must go.

14:17.631 --> 14:19.280
We're not leaving
without Fury.

14:19.389 --> 14:21.492
As soon as Madame Web
tells us what's coming next,

14:21.538 --> 14:23.202
we get Nick and vamoose!

14:23.280 --> 14:24.195
Madame Web?

14:24.241 --> 14:25.880
I don't know.

14:25.967 --> 14:27.538
It's all in flux.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.071
Too many possibilities.
Keep it together.

14:30.180 --> 14:31.517
I just need to know
what the odds are

14:31.563 --> 14:33.634
if we try to get you
and Fury out of here.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.017
Right now,
about 50-50.

14:37.063 --> 14:38.032
Good enough.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.971
So I'm gonna follow
your directions like Fury does.

14:40.017 --> 14:41.782
I don't tell Nick
what to do.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.329
I just give the odds.
He makes the choices.

14:44.392 --> 14:45.483
Well, he's not here.

14:45.529 --> 14:46.618
But you are.

14:46.696 --> 14:47.986
You want my advice?

14:48.056 --> 14:50.814
You'll solve this
if you use the last key.

14:55.618 --> 14:57.837
Wait. Is this one
of those things

14:57.883 --> 15:00.079
where I'm supposed to
realize I'm the last key,

15:00.134 --> 15:01.861
and I just have
to be myself to win?

15:01.907 --> 15:04.040
I don't know.
Is it?

15:04.212 --> 15:07.337
Uh, may I remind you,
if Hydra doesn't find us

15:07.407 --> 15:09.478
there is still the matter
of Atarog's traps.

15:09.524 --> 15:11.127
We must do
as Director Fury said,

15:11.173 --> 15:12.704
and get Madame Web
to safety.

15:12.750 --> 15:15.126
Yeah, that's the safe
and responsible plan.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.712
But if Madame Web's right,

15:16.845 --> 15:19.267
think we're gonna try
the Spidey plan instead.

15:20.275 --> 15:23.642
Oh. Looks like
your unlucky day, Fury.

15:23.759 --> 15:25.634
Your kids ran out on you.

15:25.829 --> 15:28.228
They're smart agents
who follow orders.

15:28.329 --> 15:30.642
By now, those kids
and Madame Web

15:30.704 --> 15:32.900
are halfway across
the China Sea.

of the hall.

you looked.

15:42.987 --> 15:45.310
Hey, bonehead.
