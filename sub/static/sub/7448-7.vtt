for $880.

frustrating years,

30:12.367 --> 30:15.047
Gary Jubelin judged
he had sufficient evidence

30:15.047 --> 30:18.207
to charge the men
who murdered Terry Falconer.

30:18.207 --> 30:21.607

codenamed Informant X -

30:21.607 --> 30:23.687
gave him premeditation.

30:23.687 --> 30:25.767
Informant Y - Ben Dokic -

30:25.767 --> 30:29.527
added a confession from
Anthony Perish's own mouth.

And when 'Little Willy' Strong -

30:32.207 --> 30:34.687
decided to sign his statement
against Decker,

30:34.687 --> 30:37.207
Gary had corroboration.

30:37.207 --> 30:41.166
Surely this time the DPP's
office wouldn't dare refuse him.

Gary, no need to ask how you 've
spent Christmas and New Year.

Have I missed something?

30:50.887 --> 30:53.087

30:53.087 --> 30:57.687
is the DNA linking Simpson, aka
Decker, to the JB's shooting.

- That's right.

murdered Terry Falconer,
