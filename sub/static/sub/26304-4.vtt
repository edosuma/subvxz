00:01.250 --> 00:03.769
- My brother-in-law died
three and a half months ago.

00:03.770 --> 00:06.272
Matt was the glue
that held us together.

00:07.191 --> 00:09.025
My sister is in freefall.

00:09.026 --> 00:10.610
- Are you here for group?
- This is your thing.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.320
I don't want to show up
and screw with your thing.

00:12.321 --> 00:14.405
- Just come, because I'm gonna
feel bad if you don't.

00:14.406 --> 00:15.906
- You'd be happy,
'cause you hate me.

00:15.907 --> 00:17.408
- I don't hate anyone.

00:17.409 --> 00:20.453
- I am a
successful businesswoman.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.913
My daughters are independent
and thriving.

00:22.914 --> 00:24.665
- What is that?
That is my shirt.

00:24.666 --> 00:25.876
- This shirt?

00:25.877 --> 00:29.337
I'm just mad all the time.

00:29.338 --> 00:33.716
You were right, there was
a lot about him I didn't know.

00:33.717 --> 00:35.051
- Are you gonna
give me my shirt back?

00:35.052 --> 00:37.428
- No, I really like this shirt.

00:37.429 --> 00:39.805
Do you know your husband's
passcode to his phone?

00:39.806 --> 00:41.058
- Of course.

01:01.411 --> 01:02.995
Jesus!

01:48.500 --> 01:51.043
Hey, hey, hey.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.962
Oh, my God.

01:52.963 --> 01:54.880
- What's wrong with you?
Please move.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.215
Get out of the street!
- Why don't you go...

02:05.058 --> 02:08.686
It's okay,
we're gonna find your home.

02:11.106 --> 02:13.149
- Well, that's not helpful.

02:18.030 --> 02:21.365
- Oh, my God,
he is so adorable.

02:21.366 --> 02:22.825
Wait, is it a he or she?

02:22.826 --> 02:24.577
- I thought you said
gender was over.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.371
- It is, but only for humans.
- I'm kidding, it's a he.

02:27.372 --> 02:29.957
- Oh, we should give him
a totally normal human name.

02:29.958 --> 02:32.710
You know, the more normal
it is, the funnier it will be.

02:32.711 --> 02:35.338
Like, uh, Dave the dog.
- Mm-hmm.

02:35.339 --> 02:38.424
- Or Steve the dog.
Josh the dog.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.635
Josh the dog.

02:39.636 --> 02:41.510
- I think this dog
already has a name,

02:41.511 --> 02:43.429
and a person who's losing
their mind right now.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.765
- Mm. Okay.

02:45.766 --> 02:49.477
Let's knock on some doors,
and try to find his human.

02:49.478 --> 02:52.855
- Hey, there she is.
- Oh, she is so cute!

02:52.856 --> 02:54.774
- Leigh, this is Rogue.
- Hi, Rogue.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.734
- Rogue, Leigh.
Rogue, Rogue, hey!

02:56.735 --> 02:59.654
Oh, hi, hi! Okay...

02:59.655 --> 03:01.989
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
chill out.

03:01.990 --> 03:03.741
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- Is it okay?

03:03.742 --> 03:05.326
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just, she doesn't

03:05.327 --> 03:07.244
really like when
people get too close too fast.

03:07.245 --> 03:10.581
- Noted.
So how did you two meet?

03:10.582 --> 03:13.292
- Well, I always wanted a dog
when I was a kid,

03:13.293 --> 03:15.378
and my dad didn't really
like animals,

03:15.379 --> 03:18.714
so after college,
went to the shelter,

03:18.715 --> 03:20.925
and there was these...
I don't know.

03:20.926 --> 03:24.178
All these other dogs there
ran up to the bars,

03:24.179 --> 03:25.972
wagging their tails,
and then, there's Rogue,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.556
all the way in the back.

03:27.557 --> 03:29.809
Kennel cough, covered in mange.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.227
She growled at me
when we first met.

03:32.938 --> 03:34.438
- I mean, all those other dogs,

03:34.439 --> 03:35.815
they're gonna get adopted
within the week.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.650
They didn't need me,
but Rogue did.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.652
- Aw. How about now?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.071
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Okay.

03:42.072 --> 03:43.781
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa.

03:43.782 --> 03:44.992
- I'm sorry, I don't know
what her deal is.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.118
- It's okay.
- I might need to

03:46.119 --> 03:47.660
up her Prozac, I'm sorry.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.246
- I'm sorry, did you say
your dog's on Prozac?

03:50.247 --> 03:52.081
- Yeah. Yeah, she gets anxious.

03:52.082 --> 03:53.457
It keeps her leveled
when I go to work.

03:53.458 --> 03:56.544
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:56.545 --> 03:59.005
- Okay.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.215
- What? Say it.

04:01.216 --> 04:03.676
- I've just been reading
a lot of op-eds

04:03.677 --> 04:05.970
about how we're over-medicated
as a society,

04:05.971 --> 04:11.100
and are controlled by our
Evil Overlord Big Pharma.

04:11.101 --> 04:14.395
- Well, believe me,
this dog needs her meds.

04:14.396 --> 04:17.565
- She sure seems like it.
- Oh, wow.

04:17.566 --> 04:19.817
Oh, come on.
Give her a break.

04:19.818 --> 04:22.695
You don't like people, either.
- Mm, you got me there.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.655
- Right?
- So maybe we're soul mates.

04:24.656 --> 04:27.033
- Two of a kind.
That's what I was thinking.

04:31.121 --> 04:35.166
- Maybe there's nobody looking,
and we could be his people.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.709
- Mm-mm, it's a nice dog.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.837
Dogs aren't nice
unless they're taken care of.

04:39.838 --> 04:43.382
- Can we stop calling him "it"
and give him a name?

04:43.383 --> 04:45.885
- How about Visitor,
because he's just visiting?

04:45.886 --> 04:49.055
- Mm, yeah, that's good.
Maybe he could visit forever.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.641
- Jules, it's not happening.
- Come on.

04:51.642 --> 04:55.770
Look at this little face.
- You are cute... okay.

04:55.771 --> 04:57.396
Okay.
- Yep.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.277
- Don't go into a spiral
about one review.

05:03.278 --> 05:05.071
- Well, the thing is,
Barf Girl was right.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.156
You know, I think a lot of
people leave Beautiful Beast

05:07.157 --> 05:09.867
feeling only the beast part,
and I want to start a new class

05:09.868 --> 05:12.078
that focuses less
on image and results,

05:12.079 --> 05:13.663
and more on self-love
and community.

05:13.664 --> 05:15.748
Guess what I'm calling it?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.084
- The Self-Love
Community Jamboree?

05:18.085 --> 05:21.754
- That's actually pretty good.
But I like mine better.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.174
Get ready, it's called
"Middle School Dance Party."

05:25.175 --> 05:27.134
- Your dance class is inspired

05:27.135 --> 05:29.553
by the most humiliating time
in someone's life?

05:29.554 --> 05:31.931
- Yeah, actually,
that's the point.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.850
I mean, it's all about
embracing your inner child.

05:34.851 --> 05:36.811
Mom's gonna love it.
- Yeah.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.356
- Hey.

05:40.357 --> 05:42.483
- Well, he has a microchip,

05:42.484 --> 05:44.527
but unfortunately,
it wasn't registered.

05:44.528 --> 05:48.489
- Great, so how are we going
to find his owners?

05:48.490 --> 05:50.074
- I would take him
to the nearest shelter.

05:50.075 --> 05:51.450
If his people
are looking for him,

05:51.451 --> 05:53.035
that's the first place
they'll go.

05:53.036 --> 05:54.705
Good luck with everything.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.499
- Yeah. It's okay.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.503
- No sad faces, we are
going to find your people.

06:02.504 --> 06:04.422
- Or we could keep him.
- No.

06:04.423 --> 06:05.840
Jules, you can't have a dog.

06:05.841 --> 06:07.383
You couldn't even
keep a hamster alive.

06:07.384 --> 06:09.635
- Nobody can keep
a hamster alive.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.262
Besides, it's been,
like, 20 years.

06:11.263 --> 06:13.097
I think I'm
developmentally ready.

06:13.098 --> 06:15.474
- Okay, look, this is
how it's gonna go:

06:15.475 --> 06:17.935
you're going to spam Instagram
with dog selfies

06:17.936 --> 06:19.979
for a couple weeks,
get bored, move on,

06:19.980 --> 06:24.150
and then, I feed and walk this
dog for the rest of its life.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.985
- That's how you think
it's gonna go?

06:25.986 --> 06:30.197
- I'm just saying that it's
a lot of responsibility

06:30.198 --> 06:33.075
taking care of
another living creature.

06:33.076 --> 06:36.245
- Hey, come here, girl.
Yeah, go long.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.125
- You do know that if you
feed her from the table,

06:41.126 --> 06:42.668
she's never gonna stop begging.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.754
- Well, she's already
had a hard life.

06:44.755 --> 06:47.173
So now that she's with me,
I just want her to be happy.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.425
- You know what would
make her really happy?

06:48.426 --> 06:49.884
- What?
- Boundaries.

06:49.885 --> 06:52.928
I went down a dog research
rabbit hole,

06:52.929 --> 06:54.930
and I was reading a lot
about wolf packs.

06:54.931 --> 06:56.766
They have a power structure.

06:56.767 --> 07:02.271
So if you were the powerful
and strong alpha,

07:02.272 --> 07:05.066
then Rogue gets to be
the stress-free beta.

07:05.067 --> 07:08.361
- Okay, well, uh, thanks for
the fourth grade book report.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.322
Wolves are super cool,
but Rogue and I are good, okay?

07:11.323 --> 07:13.532
- Okay, well,
I'm just saying that

07:13.533 --> 07:15.284
we need to
get our pack in order

07:15.285 --> 07:16.702
if we're ever gonna
live together.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.289
- Um, uh, live... live together?

07:21.375 --> 07:24.336
- Maybe. I don't...
Forget I said it.

07:26.964 --> 07:29.757
- You like me.
- Shut up.

07:29.758 --> 07:33.135
- Come on, admit it.
- You're...

07:33.136 --> 07:35.221
Okay, I guess.
- Yes!

07:39.059 --> 07:41.060
- Hey,

07:41.061 --> 07:44.231
I would like to talk to you
about something.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.985
- What?

07:49.736 --> 07:52.405
It's, um...

07:52.406 --> 07:55.866
I, uh...

07:55.867 --> 08:00.705
Yeah, remember when I told you
Rogue was on Prozac?

08:00.706 --> 08:02.415
Yeah, she's not the only one.

08:05.335 --> 08:09.672
- I've been taking it on and
off since I was in college.

08:09.673 --> 08:12.216
- For anxiety?
- For depression.

08:12.217 --> 08:14.219
- Wow, okay.

08:16.888 --> 08:19.849
Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, I tried.

08:19.850 --> 08:22.351
But when I told you about
Rogue, you got all judgey.

08:22.352 --> 08:23.978
- That's because Rogue's a dog.

08:23.979 --> 08:27.607
Seriously, if this
is something that helps you,

08:27.608 --> 08:30.610
that is all I care about.
- Well, it does.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.446
- Good. Okay, great.

08:33.447 --> 08:36.949
- And I know exactly what to do
to keep it under control.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.993
I take my meds.
I have a good doctor.

08:38.994 --> 08:41.245
- Good.
- But, you know,

08:41.246 --> 08:44.040
sometimes it gets bad.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.750
Um...

08:45.751 --> 08:48.002
I get difficult.
Things get dark.

08:48.003 --> 08:52.798
It's just... it's too much
for some people.

08:52.799 --> 08:57.053
- Well, I am not some people.

08:57.054 --> 08:59.639
- Really?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.350
- Really.

09:02.935 --> 09:04.227
Jeez, I thought
you were gonna tell me

09:04.228 --> 09:06.270
you were into cosplay.
- What?

09:06.271 --> 09:07.813
- You got a lot
of action figures.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.148
- Oh, my God.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.192
I am not...

09:11.193 --> 09:12.903
Into cosplay.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.988
Unless you are.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.491
I might be open to it.

09:18.492 --> 09:21.160
- Oh-ho, then I definitely
want to live with you, yeah.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.871
Yeah, that seals it.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.917
Yeah.

09:29.211 --> 09:31.045
- I can't tell you
how happy I was to hear

09:31.046 --> 09:32.546
that the original offer
fell through.

09:32.547 --> 09:34.006
I think it was meant to be.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.175
I have always wanted
to turn this place

09:36.176 --> 09:37.843
into a women's wellness center.

09:37.844 --> 09:42.139
Not just barre, but yoga,
massage, acupuncture.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.933
- Sounds ambitious.

09:43.934 --> 09:46.644
- Uh, I will start working
with an architect

09:46.645 --> 09:49.355
as soon as Mrs. Hartounian
accepts my offer.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.982
- Listen, I want to be
up front with you.

09:52.651 --> 09:54.986
- Now, Mrs. H asked me
to hear you out,

09:54.987 --> 09:58.489
but I'm expecting another offer
from a group of investors.

09:58.490 --> 10:01.325
This time, all cash.

10:01.326 --> 10:04.704
- But I-I've been her tenant
for 15 years.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.373
I stayed when they
tore up the street,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.583
and the entire neighborhood
smelled like a sewer.

10:09.584 --> 10:13.004
I... I've taken out
a second mortgage on my home.

10:13.005 --> 10:14.630
That's how much
I believe in this.

10:14.631 --> 10:17.758
- If it... if it helps,
I'm sure the new owners

10:17.759 --> 10:19.927
will let you stay as a tenant...

10:19.928 --> 10:21.637
- No.
- And anchor the place.

10:21.638 --> 10:23.556
- I don't want to be
someone's tenant.

10:23.557 --> 10:24.808
That's the whole point.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.061
- Okay, look,

10:29.062 --> 10:31.356
I'll present your offer.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.052
- Oh, shit.
God...

11:01.053 --> 11:02.845
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

11:04.222 --> 11:05.973
Hello? Hi.

11:05.974 --> 11:08.809
- I can't believe that you're
already dating again.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.853
- Oh, I know,
it all happened so fast.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.563
I think I'm in love.

11:12.564 --> 11:14.357
- No, but seriously,
you got a dog?

11:14.358 --> 11:16.859
- Mm, no, it's a stray.
I'm looking for his owner.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.235
- Well, send me his info.

11:18.236 --> 11:19.570
I'll, uh, I'll post it
on Facebook.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.781
I'm on a ton of dog groups.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.532
- You don't have a dog.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.451
- Yeah, but I like those posts
where people

11:25.452 --> 11:28.829
are reunited with their pets.
It warms my cold, dead heart.

11:28.830 --> 11:32.458
- Okay, I am sending it
to you now.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.960
- Bye.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.971
- Oh, my God.

11:47.391 --> 11:49.559
Jules, get in here.

11:53.063 --> 11:54.939
- Oh, that's not good.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.565
- You were supposed to watch
him while I took a shower.

11:56.566 --> 11:57.651
- Okay, I got distracted
for like a second...

11:57.652 --> 11:59.068
- But this is what I mean by

11:59.069 --> 12:00.987
not responsible enough
to own a dog.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.698
- Okay, well, you can't expect
me to watch him every second...

12:03.699 --> 12:07.576
- What's this?
- Oh, shi...

12:07.577 --> 12:09.620
- Why is there a dog
in my house?

12:09.621 --> 12:11.122
- Sorry, okay, okay.

12:11.123 --> 12:14.083
Uh, it's... it's just,
it's a long story.

12:14.084 --> 12:16.752
- You know, I-I don't even
want to know.

12:16.753 --> 12:19.630
I just want it gone.
- Okay.

12:19.631 --> 12:22.049
- Guys, come on.

12:22.050 --> 12:24.219
I really don't need this today.

12:29.308 --> 12:31.183
Middle School Dance Party?

12:31.184 --> 12:34.145
- Don't look at me.
That's not mine.

12:34.146 --> 12:37.481
- Okay, um, I know you've
been stressed about money.

12:37.482 --> 12:39.483
So I came up for this new idea
for the studio.

12:39.484 --> 12:43.029
It is a dance class
for your inner child.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.823
- "Pay what you can?"
- Just for the first month.

12:45.824 --> 12:49.076
And once everyone's obsessed,
it'll be full price.

12:50.287 --> 12:51.413
That's great, Jules.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.790
That's really
gonna turn the tide,

12:54.791 --> 12:57.878
if you can actually stick to
the class for more than a week.

13:04.801 --> 13:09.013
I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean it
to come out like that.

13:09.014 --> 13:11.057
- You know,
they told me in rehab

13:11.058 --> 13:12.558
the hardest part
about staying sober

13:12.559 --> 13:14.936
is the fact that
the people in your life

13:14.937 --> 13:17.813
don't believe you can change.

13:17.814 --> 13:20.150
But I didn't think
that would be you guys.

13:23.445 --> 13:24.863
- J...

13:33.664 --> 13:35.539
- One night.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.541
- Okay, okay.
- That's it.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.627
Clean that up.

13:46.426 --> 13:50.097
That's how she treats people
she likes, you're lucky.

14:02.818 --> 14:05.069
Danny.

14:55.037 --> 14:58.372
Well, he's better
than the shelter.

14:58.373 --> 15:00.667
Mm-mm, off.

15:15.641 --> 15:18.768
- One night, that's it.

15:18.769 --> 15:21.771
Get over here.

15:21.772 --> 15:24.315
Get over here, mister.

15:30.989 --> 15:34.158
Matt, Matt, get in here.
Look at this, look at this.

15:34.159 --> 15:38.621
- What's up?
- Stay, leave it.

15:38.622 --> 15:40.373
Watch.
- Yeah, I'm watching.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.958
- Leave it.

15:43.335 --> 15:46.504
Go get it!
Good girl, good girl!

15:46.505 --> 15:48.381
- Look at you guys.
- You know I have more of them,

15:48.382 --> 15:49.508
But I'm not gonna
give you any more.

15:49.509 --> 15:51.550
- That was amazing.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.885
Well, thanks for
putting in the work.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.345
- Of course.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.055
And if you really get trained,

15:56.056 --> 16:00.685
maybe we can get you
off of your meds, maybe.

16:00.686 --> 16:03.437
- You want to get Rogue
off of her Prozac?

16:03.438 --> 16:05.940
- Not all at once,
but I don't see why

16:05.941 --> 16:07.234
we should be
over-medicating her.

16:07.235 --> 16:10.861
- Mm-hmm, right.
Over-medicate.

16:10.862 --> 16:13.698
We still talking
about Rogue, here?

16:13.699 --> 16:18.452
- Look, I have been
reading up on this,

16:18.453 --> 16:22.164
and there's still so much
about the long-term effects

16:22.165 --> 16:24.083
of antidepressants
that we don't know about.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.043
And so I was talking
to my mom about it...

16:26.044 --> 16:27.628
- Wait, I'm sorry, no.

16:27.629 --> 16:28.922
You told your mom
about my meds?

16:28.923 --> 16:30.256
I haven't even told my mom.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.008
- Well, I'm really close
with my mom.

16:32.009 --> 16:33.843
- Yeah, well,
I've met her twice.

16:33.844 --> 16:37.763
- Well, she had postpartum
depression after I was born,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.432
and she said the things
that really helped her

16:39.433 --> 16:40.517
were St. John's Wort
and Omega 3 fish oil pills.

16:40.517 --> 16:41.768
- Yeah, I'm not
gonna be able to fix

16:41.769 --> 16:44.103
whatever's wrong with my brain
by taking some pill

16:44.104 --> 16:46.772
some snake oil salesman
sold to your mom.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.357
- Okay, well, you don't
need to be mean about.

16:48.358 --> 16:51.569
- I'm... you just taught my dog
some stupid tricks

16:51.570 --> 16:53.487
so you could micromanage
my mental health.

16:53.488 --> 16:54.947
Do you have any idea
how messed up that is?

16:54.948 --> 16:56.407
- No, you know what,
I'm just trying to help.

16:56.408 --> 16:58.619
- I don't want your help.
- Cool, okay.

17:07.628 --> 17:09.920
- My whole life,
everyone thought I was lazy.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.925
When I got diagnosed
my sophomore year of college,

17:14.926 --> 17:18.220
it was one of
the happiest days of my life.

17:18.221 --> 17:19.889
My doctor telling me
I had a disease

17:19.890 --> 17:22.558
instead of a character flaw.

17:22.559 --> 17:24.894
- I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

17:27.439 --> 17:30.024
- I-I need you to understand
that this isn't fixable.

17:30.025 --> 17:33.027
- Okay, but you
just need to understand

17:33.028 --> 17:35.697
that I'm never gonna stop
trying to take care of you.

17:46.124 --> 17:49.335
Oh, shoot.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.546
Visitor?

17:52.547 --> 17:54.800
Come here, boy.

17:59.388 --> 18:01.973
Where were you?

18:01.974 --> 18:03.933
- I took him for a walk.

18:03.934 --> 18:06.936
I had to get it in
because in a few weeks,

18:06.937 --> 18:08.981
I'll be too bored to do it.

18:18.490 --> 18:21.826
- I keep an orderly home.

18:21.827 --> 18:24.453
I am a good mother.

18:24.454 --> 18:27.290
I am patient.

18:27.291 --> 18:31.836
Mm, I am patient even
with my eldest daughter

18:31.837 --> 18:34.922
when she isn't patient with me.

18:34.923 --> 18:37.384
Or anyone else,
for that matter.

18:39.678 --> 18:42.930
I am a smart businesswoman
who...

18:42.931 --> 18:45.308
sucked up to her landlady
for over a decade,

18:45.309 --> 18:47.476
and priced herself
out of the market.

18:47.477 --> 18:49.020
I am...

18:51.231 --> 18:54.442
I am the one who
holds everything together,

18:54.443 --> 18:58.279
and never got the chance
to grieve my son-in-law,

18:58.280 --> 19:00.740
who was a hell of a lot nicer
than either of my own kids.

19:00.741 --> 19:03.826
I am...

19:03.827 --> 19:06.037
Starting to wonder
if this shit even works.

19:12.961 --> 19:15.379
- Hey.
Come here.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.964
See that?
Go long.

19:16.965 --> 19:18.507
There you go.

19:18.508 --> 19:21.844
Good boy! Good boy!

19:26.850 --> 19:28.809
We made this for you.
- We?

19:28.810 --> 19:30.603
I already ate.

19:30.604 --> 19:34.357
- Just drink it, and forgive me
for being a jerk.

19:35.776 --> 19:37.360
- Please.

19:41.823 --> 19:45.326
Hello? Hi.

19:45.327 --> 19:48.037
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

19:48.038 --> 19:50.623
It's Danny, he says
he found the family.

19:52.417 --> 19:55.252
His name is Boots?

19:55.253 --> 19:58.965
Okay, does he have one black
toenail on each back paw?

20:01.718 --> 20:06.347
Yep. Mm-hmm, yeah.

20:06.348 --> 20:08.474
- Okay, yeah, it's him.
- Okay. I'll tell them.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.643
- Thanks.

20:13.981 --> 20:15.815
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

20:15.816 --> 20:18.150
He's gonna go home.
That's what I wanted.

20:20.404 --> 20:22.780
- Well, Danny's
going to text the address,

20:22.781 --> 20:24.532
and if you want, I can
come with you after class.

20:24.533 --> 20:27.368
- No, if I were his owner,
I would...

20:27.369 --> 20:30.289
I wouldn't want to wait
another minute.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.584
- And if we got to keep you,
I would have named you Josh.

20:35.585 --> 20:37.253
Oh, good-bye.

20:37.254 --> 20:38.797
Oh-ho-ho.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.760
I will see you later.

20:44.761 --> 20:47.848
- Okay.
Hey, have a nice first class.

20:58.692 --> 21:03.654
- Welcome to the very first
Middle School Dance Party!

21:05.032 --> 21:08.242
Okay, I want you
to look in the mirror.

21:08.243 --> 21:10.328
That person is not your enemy.

21:10.329 --> 21:13.497
That person is your
best friend.

21:13.498 --> 21:16.083
All those things
that make us weird or awkward,

21:16.084 --> 21:20.796
those are also the things that
make us gorgeous and amazing.

21:32.643 --> 21:35.061
- Okay, guys.

21:35.062 --> 21:38.439
Are you ready to embrace
your inner tween?

21:38.440 --> 21:40.900
Yes?

21:40.901 --> 21:44.862
5, 6, 7, 8.
Isolations!

21:44.863 --> 21:48.282
Add hips.
Yeah, Sean!

21:50.535 --> 21:52.161
Yes!

21:52.162 --> 21:56.749
And turn, and clap.
Turn, clap, clap.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.336
And right, left,
to the left, right, left.

22:00.337 --> 22:04.757
To the left, right, left.
To the right.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.759
And grapevine.

22:08.679 --> 22:11.138
And pose.
Drop a pose!

22:11.139 --> 22:13.099
Strike a pose!

22:15.894 --> 22:17.187
- I know.

22:19.940 --> 22:22.817
- This is it.

22:22.818 --> 22:26.154
You want me to take him up?

22:29.908 --> 22:31.994
Bye.

22:35.038 --> 22:38.249
Here you go.
- Let's go, buddy.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.669
- Here's the leash.
- Oh, thanks.

22:42.879 --> 22:45.340
Come on.
Let's go, big guy.

22:50.387 --> 22:54.181
- Oh, oh, my God!
- Come here, boy!

22:54.182 --> 22:56.434
- Hi. How you doing?
- Come on, let's go inside.

23:04.776 --> 23:08.321
- There's nothing else
we can do, you heard her.

23:08.322 --> 23:09.822
- Then we should find
another doctor.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.616
- Leigh, come on.

23:11.617 --> 23:15.453
We can't keep pretending
this isn't happening.

23:15.454 --> 23:17.872
Maybe just a couple more days.

23:20.417 --> 23:25.087
- I know how much you love her,
but she's in pain.

23:27.215 --> 23:30.635
- It's time to let her go.

23:30.636 --> 23:33.137
Hey, hey, come here.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.522
- I know.

24:51.174 --> 24:54.844
Rogue was a great dog.

24:57.055 --> 25:00.349
- You know, Matt told me about
that day Rogue died.

25:00.350 --> 25:02.143
It was the day
after Christmas, right?

25:02.144 --> 25:03.811
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:03.812 --> 25:06.522
He said he would
never forget it

25:06.523 --> 25:09.358
because that was the day
that he knew

25:09.359 --> 25:11.111
he was gonna marry you.

25:33.342 --> 25:35.926
12, 26.

26:03.705 --> 26:04.915
- You were weird at the party,

26:04.916 --> 26:06.290
you didn't say a word
on the car ride home,

26:06.291 --> 26:07.833
and now you want to go
straight to bed.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.002
- I'm tired.
- Everyone is tired.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.004
It's Friday.

26:11.005 --> 26:13.172
You completely shut down.

26:13.173 --> 26:15.633
- I know Leigh would love it
if I finished my comic book.

26:15.634 --> 26:17.009
- Leigh would love it?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.678
- I want everyone to read it.

26:18.679 --> 26:21.681
Why is that so hard to say?
- Say it again.

26:21.682 --> 26:23.182
Even if it's hard.

26:23.183 --> 26:24.976
- As long as you insist on
being right about everything,

26:24.977 --> 26:26.061
you're never gonna be
in a relationship

26:26.062 --> 26:27.687
that lasts longer
than six months.

26:27.688 --> 26:29.272
- How does Leigh get her voice

26:29.273 --> 26:30.731
to come out of your mouth
like that?

26:30.732 --> 26:32.525
- I wish I had
a better understanding

26:32.526 --> 26:34.736
of what you're going through.
