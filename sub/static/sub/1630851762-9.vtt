(downtempo music playing)

00:12.637 --> 00:15.181
The floors have
just been redone.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.725
Gets plenty
of natural light,

00:16.808 --> 00:18.435
and the windows
are double-paned,

00:18.518 --> 00:21.479
which keeps
the street noise out,
and the heat in.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.899
Good 'cause she
stay shiverin' under
like 10 blankets.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.695
You stay puttin' your
icy-ass feet on me,
so who's livin' right?

00:28.778 --> 00:30.196
Okay, you guys wander.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.157
If you have any questions,
I'll be up front.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.700
-Thank you.
-Yep.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.580
This is nice.
This is nice.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.623
-I could see us here.
-Right?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.584
And it's close
to your shop.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.961
I can take the train to NBW,

00:45.044 --> 00:47.046
or walk to Crenshawn's.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.883
Plus, it's got two Wingstops
equidistant from each other.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.217
I mean, c'mon.

00:52.093 --> 00:55.805
Yeah, it's big, too.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.433
-We need two bedrooms?
-Hell yeah.

00:58.516 --> 01:02.103
This could be an office
or a guest room.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.648
Plus, we're gonna need
a "cool off" room just
in case we have a beef.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.109
If we in separate rooms,

01:08.193 --> 01:10.195
how we gonna have
make-up sex?

01:10.278 --> 01:13.656
Trust me, you're gonna
want the extra space.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.705

01:20.789 --> 01:22.415
Hey,

01:32.592 --> 01:36.221
I mean,
Ahmal had chaotic
bathroom habits.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.018
But... I mean,
it's kind of perfect.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.228

09:45.209 --> 09:47.837
Um, have you not
met Rolando?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.425
I'll never forget you. Bye.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.971
(clinking glass)

09:58.973 --> 10:00.308
-Derek?
-Oh, thank god.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.101
-I thought that was in my head.
-(Taurean laughs)

10:02.184 --> 10:04.854
I think I'm startin'
to feel it. Are you?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.897
Do you smell
mac 'n' cheese balls?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.066
I swear I smell
mac 'n' cheese balls.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.694
Can we all gather
for a toast?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.070
She said gather!

10:13.154 --> 10:14.989
-Shit.
-Okay.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.326
Thank you, baby.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.162
Well, we just
wanted to thank
everyone for coming.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.331
We're gonna miss
you all so, so much.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.498
And even though

10:24.582 --> 10:25.833
Denver has one
of the most unique

10:25.916 --> 10:28.627
city park systems
in the nation,

10:28.711 --> 10:31.839
what it doesn't have...
is you.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.051
So, we just wanna
show our appreciation
to all of you.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.261
Kelli, I know
people throw around

10:37.345 --> 10:39.639
"ride or die"
all casually...

10:39.722 --> 10:41.766
but I feel like you would
actually die for me.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.268
I would...
I would kill
for you, too.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.104
And Derek. I would,
I would kill Derek.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.231
And my guys
over there.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.608
My Papa Posse.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.443
Still don't love
the name, but...

10:52.526 --> 10:55.071
Craig, Edward,
Lawrence, Marjon...

10:55.154 --> 10:57.323
I'mma miss neglecting
our kids with y'all.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.994
Issa...
I love you, girl.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.455
There is no one else
like you in my life.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.248
Thank you?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.541
Hey, do me,
do me, do me!

11:07.625 --> 11:10.920
-Derek: Um... and--
-And Dro!

11:12.380 --> 11:14.090
-Oh shit!
-Girl!

11:14.173 --> 11:15.549
-You heard that?
-Everybody did.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.468
Tiffany:
Well, all of you
are so fabulous

11:17.551 --> 11:18.427
in your own way.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.637
And even though
Denver has six

11:19.720 --> 11:20.846
professional
sports teams,

11:20.930 --> 11:23.391
which means my baby's
gonna be getting the bag.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.142
Mmm.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.396
What it doesn't have...

11:29.939 --> 11:30.898
is you.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.067
(whispers):
She said
that already.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.903
Here's to love,
life...

11:35.986 --> 11:37.697
and great
friendships.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.739
We'll miss y'all.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.784
-Cheers.
-(all saying "cheers")

11:41.867 --> 11:43.077
Cheers.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.500
-You okay, girl?
-(sighs) I just--

11:49.583 --> 11:51.377
I didn't expect to be all--

11:53.045 --> 11:54.922
(Tiffany exhales)

11:55.005 --> 11:57.883
Do you guys mind if
I steal them for a minute?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.593
Chad:
You know how much money
I spent on that briefcase?

11:59.677 --> 12:00.719
Bruh, get out your feelings.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.638
It's 100% eel.
I told you it's cold.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.098
Nigga, that's
an endangered species.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.433
And?
That's why I'm sayin'

12:05.516 --> 12:06.976
they should do
somethin' for me.

12:07.059 --> 12:07.977
Just talk to 'em
about it.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.311
Yeah, you want me
to talk to 'em about it?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.397
-Nah, I'm good. I'm cool.
-Right here, c'mon.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.899
Hey, I read somewhere
that Denver has 0.001

12:13.983 --> 12:15.776
Black people per capita,
so, for every person,

12:15.860 --> 12:17.653
there's only 0.001
Black people.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.655
You about to be
a fraction, nigga.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.991
Hey, so whatchu gonna miss
about L.A. the most, man?

12:23.367 --> 12:24.910
Honestly,
the food.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.038
Mexican,
barbecue, sushi.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.999
I mean, there's no way
Denver has good sushi.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.960
Mmm, barbecue sounds
so good right now.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.296
I mean, L.A. got
bomb-ass weather,

12:35.379 --> 12:37.339
but y'all gotta leave
the barbecue alone.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.843
Oh, no, sir.
L.A. got some bomb
barbecue spots.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.847
Yeah, I mean, you got Woody's,
Bludso's, Moo's Craft, Ray's.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.056
That's just off the top.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.476
Yeah, if you
a transplant...
just say that.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.685
I'm from Houston.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.479
-There it is.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I felt it.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.938
Go ahead and talk
yo' shit, Houston.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.064
They got the meats out there.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.609
-They do... They really do.
-Hell yeah.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.405
I mean, I still stand by L.A.
havin' good barbecue, though.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.908
You know,
people who haven't
been here long enough,

13:03.991 --> 13:05.159
they just write it off.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.620
That's true, too.

13:07.703 --> 13:12.666
Nah, once people
have Texas barbecue,
they know what's good.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.211
Barbecue must not
be good enough
to keep 'em there.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.549
Why'd this get so tense?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.553
Hey... my man, Rolando,
thinks I would look

13:24.637 --> 13:26.597
so cute with a Caesar,
but I don't know.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.099
-Whatchu doin' tomorrow?
-Oh, I'm out.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.185
Me and Issa still
lookin' at apartments.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.648
So, should I get
us some barbecue?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.775
Postmates says it'll
only take 20 minutes.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.069
I upgraded priority
delivery last week.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.779
Game changer, y'all.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.405
-Game changer.
-Okay.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.490
So...

13:44.573 --> 13:46.408
-You like briefcase?
-Derek: Hey,

13:46.492 --> 13:48.661
you know,
we're, we're friends
outside of Lawrence.

13:48.744 --> 13:52.039
Like it's, it's gon' be okay.
We gon' keep in touch.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.541
I-- Yeah, I knew that.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.210
-What day are y'all leavin'?
-Sunday.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.254
Well, I'm gonna save
my goodbyes 'til then.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.256
What? Ah, hold up.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.549
Champagne
ain't alcohol.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.425
Oh, you got
new rules now?

14:03.509 --> 14:06.345
-I'm evolving.
-(all laughing)

14:06.428 --> 14:08.430
-Thank you.
-You know what?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.015
I am not gonna
be sad today.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.517
I'm just gonna look
forward to seeing you

14:11.600 --> 14:14.103
-once you're settled.
-Well...

14:14.186 --> 14:17.064
You'll see me before then
'cause I'm coming back
for Molly's birthday.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.941
I talked to Derek,
and he's down with it.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.277
(all exclaiming)

14:22.695 --> 14:24.613
And I was thinking,
even though
I'm gonna be gone,

14:24.697 --> 14:27.324
it doesn't mean we
can't plan to see
each other more.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.911
Oh, 100%.
I mean, we may be
some busy bitches,

14:30.995 --> 14:32.204
but we gon'
make that happen.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.706
Issa:
Yeah. You know what?

14:33.789 --> 14:35.916
You're comin' down
for Molly's birthday,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.002
and your birthday's
right after that.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.629
Y'all, we should be here
for each other's birthdays.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.964
That's the least we can do.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.134
-That part.
-I love that.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.427
I mean...

14:46.510 --> 14:48.554
can you just imagine
how much will change,

14:48.637 --> 14:50.139
like in two years--

14:50.222 --> 14:51.640
Who will have
another baby?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.559
Who'll get a new job?
(laughs)

14:53.642 --> 14:57.396
Who'll be taller?
Or smaller? Or both?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.567
Huh?

15:01.650 --> 15:02.776
Molly?

15:02.860 --> 15:06.363
-I'm sorry.
-(all laughing)

15:09.074 --> 15:11.285
(laughs)

15:13.954 --> 15:15.873
Why this bitch
laughin' so hard?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.542
Tiffany:
Are you okay?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.170
(wild laughter)

15:25.257 --> 15:27.593
-(Issa laughing)
-Ahh!

15:27.676 --> 15:28.802
Bitch, you slapped me.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.473
What in the open fuck
is wrong with you?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.895
Okay, okay, fine.
Taurean and I had
edibles earlier,

15:37.978 --> 15:40.856
and that shit
is kickin' in like
a soccer game, girl.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.359
I am hiiigh.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.110
-There it is.
-Kelli: Listen...

15:45.194 --> 15:46.487
-if we gon' work together--
-Mm-hm.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.656
I'm gonna need you to tell
me when you do drugs,

15:48.739 --> 15:50.991
-so we can do them together.
-(all laughing)

15:51.075 --> 15:53.577
Molly:
Why're you guys
so loud?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.330
-Hi.
-All (softly): Hey.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.291
I just am comin' to get
a bottle out of the fridge.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.212
Yeah, babies do
be needin' bottles.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.757
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Oh, no, no, you're good.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.884
Yeah, no, girl,
you should be here.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.094
You got a invitation.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.887
I'mma invite you over here.
'Scuse us.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.473
-(softly): Did I say somethin'?
-No, you good, girl. C'mon.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.725
Ooh!

16:16.809 --> 16:19.436
It's so good to see
you... and the baby.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.646
Yeah.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.565
I mean it.
He's so cute.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.359
Y'all are doin'
a good job.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.195
I mean,
not that you need
my opinion at all.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.363
Just...

16:30.614 --> 16:32.116
Congrats.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.118
Thanks.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.329
And I, uh, I heard about
your Art Walk with NBW.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.708
Um, I used to work with Raphael
back when he was at Verizon.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.751
-Oh, Raphael?
Raphael at the office?
-Mm-hm.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
He's so nice.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.381
-Really deep eyebrows.
-(Condola laughs)

16:48.549 --> 16:49.717
(laughs)

16:50.884 --> 16:52.511
Uh, well...

16:53.345 --> 16:54.263
Come on.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.223
Come on.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.897
-(door shuts)
-(Molly exhales)

17:03.981 --> 17:06.358
Whew, bitch,
that was weird.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.741
Dro:
Can I get these two? Yeah.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.534
Bartender:
Here you go.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.165
Hey, Molly.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.833
You know, I tried
callin' you to check in.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.334
I heard about the divorce.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.380
My mama don't stop
runnin' her mouth.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.674
Yeah.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.844
Yeah, look, I, I wanted to be
the one to tell you, um...

17:34.762 --> 17:36.472
Not for, you know...

17:36.555 --> 17:39.016
any reason, just,
um, you know we...

17:40.017 --> 17:41.477
we used to be closer.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.730
And, and, uh, just
thought you should know.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.193
Did you wanna
talk about it?

17:50.527 --> 17:53.822
No... No, shit happens.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.658
You know, and we
both had our issues.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.329
Look, I-I'm
movin' on... so.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.249
Then I'm happy for you.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.044
Yeah, your
friend seems...
really nice.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.670
Yeah, yeah, she is.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.131
So does the dude
that you came with.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.424
Who? Him?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.344
Hi... y'all good?

18:16.386 --> 18:18.180
Yeah.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.556
Oh, this is Dro.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.391
Him and his wife had
a open relationship,

18:21.475 --> 18:23.018
so we kinda dated.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.186
What? Molly.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.271
We hooked up,
like a lot.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.274
-Mm.
-Things got messy,
but we good now.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.567
(awkward chuckle)

18:31.610 --> 18:32.820
Okay, then.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.367
Yeah, um...
right, anyways,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.577
I'mma check
on Morgan.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.287
Um...

18:43.872 --> 18:44.957
Hmm.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.626
So, you understand?

18:47.709 --> 18:48.919
You explained it very clearly.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.046
-I did.
-I mean, we all got a past.

18:51.129 --> 18:54.091
Heh, I used to sell Adderall
to half my senior class,

18:54.174 --> 18:57.010
-so...
-Oh, I'm gonna need that story.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.055
Hi. There you are.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.723
Mwah!

19:01.807 --> 19:03.851
Oh, they got
a chocolate fountain?

19:03.934 --> 19:05.060
I'm 'bout to go in.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.522
Oh, and they got
the colorful cookies, too?

19:08.605 --> 19:11.191
Macarons!
You want some?

19:11.275 --> 19:13.986
Nah, not really, uh--
I'm not hungry.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.737
-(phone buzzes)
-You sure?
