WEBVTT

01:14.000 --> 01:16.720
Faith is needed
but never enough, huh?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.280
Well, yes, she proved that, right?

01:21.520 --> 01:24.600
To quote you even more,
as Augustin said:

01:24.680 --> 01:27.360
"We drink poison,
waiting for our enemy to die.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.920
Christ sacrificed himself
for our existence,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.040
for our Christian identity."

01:32.120 --> 01:34.800
-You have good memory.
-Yeah, it's my biggest flaw.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.960
I never forget.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.720
You might have a nice personality,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.760
but that's not the reason
why you're here.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.920
It's your impact on a huge number
of followers that is outstanding.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.160
Congratulations.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.520
Vera <i>und</i> Terje.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.400
You are married.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.680
PASSPORT
NORWAY

02:03.760 --> 02:05.120
I'll get back to my car.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.800
Fuck.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.240
You said things were under control!

03:13.320 --> 03:14.680
How does this look

03:14.760 --> 03:17.440
if somebody out there
finds out what really went down?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.960
According to what we know,

03:19.040 --> 03:22.520
an attack bigger than July 22
is happening in the near future.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.040
That should tell you something.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.240
My agent risks her life
every single day.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.920
Where is she?

03:31.560 --> 03:32.840
Who is she with?

03:36.560 --> 03:38.280
I can't have another Gothenburg.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.080
Do you have control over your agent?

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
We're in control.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.440
We know where she is, don't we?

03:55.520 --> 03:58.480
I couldn't tell him she just passed
the border into Germany.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.880
He freaked out.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.320
We need to find out
who the German is.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.360
Keep tracking her phone.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.960
Get in touch with Asgeir.
And get me his file.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.360
Now?

04:19.440 --> 04:23.440
I need to contact someone I can
trust in Germany first. Unofficially.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.440
About why it needs to be unofficial,
and why Kathi will help.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.120
THE GERMAN

04:36.960 --> 04:38.720
Sixteen presidents
of the State Police

04:38.800 --> 04:41.200
and as many from
the Federal State Security.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.840
You can be sure, Kathi,
when this meeting is over,

04:43.920 --> 04:46.040
they won't even agree on
what time we have.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.800
Is it important?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.560
Couldn't say.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.200
Plus forty-seven?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.080
Norway.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.640
I must return to my department.
What's up, Mr State Secretary?

04:57.720 --> 05:02.800
I'd like you to replace me
at the police chiefs' briefings.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.760
Until the federal elections
in four weeks,

05:04.840 --> 05:07.520
we want you closer to all
counter-terrorism operations.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.560
Say, as supervisor.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.760
You want to throw me into
that pool of sharks down there?

05:12.840 --> 05:15.360
You're the state secretary.
It's your meeting, not mine.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.000
People grow with their tasks,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.520
and I think you have
a great career ahead of you.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.600
As your pawn sacrifice?

05:21.680 --> 05:23.160
Please, not so dramatic.

05:23.240 --> 05:27.040
It's the Minister's wish
that you keep this election safe.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.280
What shall I tell the Minister?

05:31.360 --> 05:33.520
Ok. Ok, I'll do it.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.400
At least come up with
a job title that sounds meaningful.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.200
<i>Hi Kathi,</i>
<i>it's Inger Pries from Oslo.</i>

05:41.280 --> 05:43.120
Inger, what a surprise.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.720
<i>I'm still sorry I couldn't make it</i>
<i>to your wedding.</i>

05:45.800 --> 05:48.160
Well, you missed the divorce too,
so...

05:48.240 --> 05:49.640
<i>Wow, that's fast.</i>

05:49.720 --> 05:51.840
Yeah, he loved himself
more than I did.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.000
Ok, but this isn't
a private chat, is it?

05:57.080 --> 05:57.920
<i>No.</i>

05:59.080 --> 06:01.920
We've infiltrated
a right-wing cell in Norway.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
One of the leaders is German.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.840
But I don't have
anything on him yet.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.000
But I do have an undercover agent

06:08.080 --> 06:10.480
traveling with him
to Germany right now.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.600
I need all the intel that you got.
And put in an official request.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.680
No, Kathi.
This has to stay between you and me.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.200
I'm afraid we might have a leak.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.240
And I've read that you've had
some leaks at your end too.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.080
Well, officially we have no leaks,
but yes, of course we have.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.920
Ok, I'll keep it
under the radar as long as I can.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.400
<i>Thank you, Kathi.</i>

06:41.480 --> 06:42.480
Bye.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.440
-Kathi?
-Yes.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.520
Thank you.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.560
Ah, that's that. Good, thanks.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.080
Hurry up, and bring Helmut! Now.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.160
Ok. I will tell the terrorists:
"Please wait until tomorrow,

06:59.240 --> 07:02.120
our authorities can't
catch up with you right now."

07:05.480 --> 07:06.600
Shit.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.520
I need a quick update.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.880
BÃ¶hringer is throwing me

07:10.960 --> 07:13.400
into a meeting with
the police chiefs without warning.

07:14.080 --> 07:14.880
When?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.240
Now. The session's already started.
Helmut?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.120
Nothing.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.120
There's no acute danger
among the extreme right-wing groups.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.960
-Also with us...
-Sorry.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.840
We have evidence of some very dubious
party donations from Russia

07:28.920 --> 07:31.720
for the National Alternative
of Germany.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.280
The Russians finance our
right-wing populists with Bitcoin.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.560
-We're observing the flow of money.
-Ok. What do you got, Eva?

07:38.640 --> 07:40.480
Things look worse in my department.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.000
We might have found
a new ISIS-cell here in Berlin.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.680
Verfassungsschutz is working on
getting it confirmed.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.240
-Do we have secure information?
-Yes.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.880
These are the Safar brothers.
They're from Iraq.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.680
We've followed them
for some time now.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.000
They've been in contact with
radical Salafists.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.680
However, we haven't classified them
as very dangerous.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.760
Until now.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.360
It looks they're trying to buy
12 kilos of C4 explosives.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.760
-That's enough to...
-I know what it's enough for.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.680
Who knows about this?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.480
Only our department.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.160
<i>-Are you sure?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

08:24.240 --> 08:26.680
I'll only do it if you want to.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.560
It's fine. I really want to.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
Ok.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.880
You said we need to hide.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.080
That's not something
you need to worry about...

08:37.160 --> 08:40.160
I know, but it's fine. It's smart.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.240
Didn't mom have short hair once?

08:53.320 --> 08:54.760
Yes, she did.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.280
But I've only seen pictures.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.200
How did she look?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.560
She looked cool. Always.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.680
Very pretty.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.880
I look like a boy.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.360
-Pretty.
-Thank you.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.720
Good afternoon.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.520
I am Kathi Falke,

09:26.600 --> 09:31.640
coordinator of
the Anti-Terror Department.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.040
The Minister of the Interior
asked me to supervise

09:34.120 --> 09:36.880
the coordination of
all LKAs and Intelligence agencies

09:36.960 --> 09:38.720
until the upcoming federal election.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.120
Our savior!

09:43.600 --> 09:48.400
Can you tell me what special security
measures you'd have us implement

09:48.480 --> 09:51.080
that we haven't used
in the last ten years?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.320
As you all know,
the biggest challenge

09:54.400 --> 09:57.880
is sharing information
across regions and departments.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.600
That's why we're here.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.040
How can we trust your supervision

10:03.120 --> 10:06.080
when your ex-husband
is the minister's spin doctor?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.480
And you bashed our work
in an internal report?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.160
The report was internal.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.840
And my criticism was of substance.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.480
The report just insists

10:18.560 --> 10:22.800
that all threats must be treated
with great seriousness,

10:22.880 --> 10:25.120
regardless of politics or religion.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.520
In a nutshell.
But you know my report.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.200
So religion doesn't matter

10:31.280 --> 10:35.360
when the Safar brothers detonate
12 kilograms of C4 explosives?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.840
-We're just verifying...
-You know that 12 kilos

10:43.920 --> 10:47.640
of highly explosive C4
is in the hands of radical Iraqis,

10:47.720 --> 10:49.960
and you have the nerve
to tell us here

10:50.040 --> 10:52.600
that we might have prejudice
against Islamists?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.840
The situation is still unclear.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.600
But did you intend
to share your information

10:57.680 --> 11:00.480
about this unclear situation
with us here?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
Or was this just about lecturing us?

11:21.680 --> 11:22.480
1 NEW MESSAGE

11:22.560 --> 11:25.960
RUSSIAN CRYPTO FUNDING FOR NAD
HAS BEEN EXPOSED. I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.520
We're just outside of Berlin.
I must see you immediately.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.080
What's up?

12:03.160 --> 12:05.040
They found our cryptocurrency.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.440
What?

12:07.600 --> 12:10.880
-Do you want me to repeat it?
-Are you sure?

12:12.480 --> 12:15.240
Are you sure they haven't hacked into
all our computers?

12:17.080 --> 12:21.040
Now the following happens:
All disks have to be deleted.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.360
Our central base will be vacated.
Clean up everything. Is that clear?

12:24.440 --> 12:26.720
What about them,
don't they have a computer?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.080
Hand me your phones.

12:37.880 --> 12:38.920
Why?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.080
You must stay
at a contact's house nearby.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.600
The guy there, you can trust him.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.680
He's not part of the operation,
so keep your covers.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.120
-More hardware?
-Yeah.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.480
We're almost in Berlin.
We should stick to the schedule.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.080
And what are we supposed to do
without equipment?

12:57.080 --> 12:59.080
Someone will bring you
new hardware.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.320
Have you spoken to...

13:09.040 --> 13:11.240
I've cleared it with him.
He'll meet you there.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.320
That's the address.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.480
He knows me as Schulz.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.200
You're safe
till I've sorted this out.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.440
Come on.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.360
-Falke.
<i>-The Minister wants to see you.</i>

13:42.120 --> 13:43.400
-Yes.
<i>-Now.</i>

13:43.480 --> 13:44.480
On my way.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.440
My report was internal.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.520
-Who gave him that?
-No idea.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.280
But you should be confident about it.
That report gave you this job.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.640
I need the police presidents' trust
in order to do a good job!

14:01.880 --> 14:03.440
Quite the idealist.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.360
Idealism would suit them well.
The minister too.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.720
I understand, Mrs. Chancellor.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.960
What do you think 12 kilos of C4
explosives might cause, Miss Falke?

14:30.280 --> 14:34.880
The explosive power is devastating.
About comparable to a plane crash.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.160
Wrong!

14:36.240 --> 14:39.160
The Chancellor was so kind
and explained to me

14:39.240 --> 14:41.920
exactly what effect
12 kilos of C4 explosives

14:42.000 --> 14:44.160
have in the hands
of Islamist terrorists.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.320
They can blow up a building
or maybe the subway.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.480
They kill a few hundred people.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.640
The pictures of dead children
will go around the world.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.560
In four weeks, the German government
will be voted out of office,

14:57.640 --> 14:59.880
and what will happen next is...

15:01.000 --> 15:04.120
Rudolf Hensel of
the National Alternative of Germany

15:04.200 --> 15:06.960
becomes Chancellor of the most
powerful economy in Europe.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.360
He forms his cabinet and decides
to leave the European Union.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.280
Our economically weak neighbors fall
apart without Germany's help

15:15.360 --> 15:17.560
and are soon also ruled by populists.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.960
Everything that's been achieved
to secure Europe since World War II

15:23.040 --> 15:24.920
will be destroyed in no time at all.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.280
The European Union will be history.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.640
And with it,
the stability of the continent.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.080
That's what
12 kilos of C4 explosives do

15:34.160 --> 15:37.480
in the hands of Islamist terrorists,
Miss Falke.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.280
If you fail to inform me
of such a situation again,

15:41.360 --> 15:42.960
you'll both be fired.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.920
Of course it's tough psychologically
for a little girl

15:52.000 --> 15:54.960
to be hunted by the Russian mob.
It's completely absurd.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.720
But she needs to be with her father.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.200
Right now you are her biggest threat.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.560
-Jesus.
-Zimonov wants to kill you,

16:01.640 --> 16:05.240
and you're running around like you
want the whole world's attention.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.760
Ok. Ok.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.880
What do you want, Inger?

16:11.920 --> 16:13.440
I need you to go to Germany.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.120
Now.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.600
I need someone with your skill set.
Unofficially.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.560
You want me to leave Michelle now?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.880
I'll make sure
she can stay with Chief.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.120
Ragna is as important to me
as your daughter is to you.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.600
I've failed her before
and I won't do it again.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.200
Almost got her killed because
we didn't provide back-up.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.720
You're a good back-up.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.880
And what are you doing for me, Inger?

16:46.960 --> 16:49.320
I won't just get you new identities.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.080
I will help you fight back.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.720
Zimonov...

16:57.800 --> 17:00.160
is currently working for
the Russian government.

17:00.720 --> 17:06.480
He takes on operations that not
even the GRU or FSB want.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.640
Black-ops operations.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.520
Officially it's election-meddling,

17:11.600 --> 17:15.600
and guess where there's an election
that Russia wants to interfere with.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.280
If you have new information
about Zimonov, I want it now.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.320
Focus on Ragna first.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.720
I want everything you have on him,
or I do nothing.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.680
I'd love to give it to you,

17:24.760 --> 17:27.240
but the director of PST
has already freaked out.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.560
You don't even know where Ragna is.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.280
Do you?

18:13.640 --> 18:14.800
Hi. Hello.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.120
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.680
-So you are Tarje?
-Yeah. Terje.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.080
Nice to meet you. Martin.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.800
-Nice to meet you too.
-And you must be Vera.

18:23.880 --> 18:24.880
I'll take that.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.360
Pleasure to meet you.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.920
Yes, so, please...

18:30.480 --> 18:31.360
Come in.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.040
Jennifer?

18:33.600 --> 18:35.720
Jennifer, let me introduce you
to our guests.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.280
This is Vera and her husband Terje.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.360
They'll be staying with us
for a few days.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.480
Welcome.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.560
We're sorry for just barging
in here on such short notice.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.760
No, no trouble at all. Schulz said
it was an emergency, so...

18:47.840 --> 18:49.240
how could I say no?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.160
Let me show you your room.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.600
We'll be having some people over
for a small party.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.880
My wife is making
amazing grilled food.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.440
You'll be more than welcome
to join us if you want.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.960
-Sure, that sounds nice.
-Great.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.080
I would love to introduce you
to some of my friends.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.560
I'm a big fan of yours.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.200
I'm sorry?

19:15.760 --> 19:17.680
Your blog. Your writing.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.360
When Schulz told me
I almost didn't believe it. I mean...

19:23.440 --> 19:24.720
Furia in my home.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.720
I debated you last night, actually,
in my little online community.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.280
I comment on your blog a lot.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.080
You once answered me, you know?

19:45.720 --> 19:47.680
Hegel42 is my tag.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.680
Will you be writing anything
while you're here?

19:56.240 --> 19:58.080
I don't know. We'll see.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
Well...

20:02.240 --> 20:06.320
Make yourself comfortable.
And welcome to my house.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.280
Thank you very much.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.080
-I can sleep on the floor...
-He knows I'm Furia?

20:18.320 --> 20:19.320
Yes.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.840
Brehme probably had to tell him
to let us stay here.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.880
And that's okay with you? That he
just exposes my identity like that?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.280
If Brehme trusts him, we can too.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.360
Besides, he may know you're Furia,
but he knows you as Vera.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.320
For not being the leader,
Brehme sure calls a lot of the shots.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.680
You can sleep on the floor.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.120
So some of Zimonov's men
are in Germany?

20:46.160 --> 20:47.640
Seems like it.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.280
-Did you know about the deal?
-Yes.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.400
I suggested it to her.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.320
Asgeir, we can't continue like
before. It doesn't work.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.800
No.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.640
-And you trust her, right?
-Yeah. 100%. I like her.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.560
She saved my job.
They were ready to kick me out.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.880
You can't say no.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.920
He's not going to chase us anymore.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.000
I'm going to chase him.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.600
-Do you want to...
-Yes.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.000
I can stay with uncle BjÃ¸rnar
if you have to do something.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.400
Were you listening?

22:05.680 --> 22:08.200
Hi, Eva. Any news?

22:08.280 --> 22:11.760
Yes. This is Sonnenallee 234
in NeukÃ¶lln.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.560
The Safar brothers live there.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.640
We hacked their mobile communications

22:15.720 --> 22:18.880
and decoded an encrypted
messenger service called Yathrib.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.640
The Safar brothers and their entire
network use Yathrib to communicate.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.680
They're Iraqi,
but they came out of Syria in 2016.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.200
Open the chat, please.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.800
"The Armenians are coming for tea."

22:33.880 --> 22:36.400
"At SÃ¼dblock at four."

22:36.480 --> 22:38.680
"The Caliph of Baghdad
will be on time."

22:38.760 --> 22:41.320
The C4 is smuggled from Armenia.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.120
They'll deliver the explosives
at four.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.720
That means we still have an hour.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.240
If they go by Baghdad time,
we have 18 minutes.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.520
-Shit.
-Yes. I'll call BÃ¶hringer.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.800
We'll need the SEK.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.840
The Germans' names
are Brehme and Schulz.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.760
DK radar control has the photo.
On our way to Berlin.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.280
Vera?

23:52.960 --> 23:53.760
Vera?

23:55.200 --> 23:56.800
Trying to find the bathroom.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.680
Everything looks the same
in this house.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.200
Guests have started to arrive.
They want to meet my lovely wife.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.880
I'll be there in a minute.
I'm just...

24:21.320 --> 24:23.840
<i>-We're in position.</i>
-Kathi Falke.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.320
-Herres, the SEK Commander.
-Can we evacuate the building?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.040
Not without alerting them.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.880
We expect 12 kilograms
of C4 explosives to be delivered.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.280
Enough to blow up the whole block.
Do we have enough people on site?

24:35.360 --> 24:36.520
It's not our first time.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.520
-Do we have an order?
-Yes.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.360
Ok, guys. We have an order. Go in.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.160
<i>Ok, we're going in.</i>

24:45.120 --> 24:46.160
<i>We're in front.</i>

24:55.800 --> 24:57.320
<i>Advancing from all sides.</i>

25:01.720 --> 25:03.320
<i>Wait for a command, then go.</i>

25:11.680 --> 25:12.640
Stay ready.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.640
Go!

25:45.960 --> 25:47.360
Stop or I'll shoot!

25:52.320 --> 25:54.000
Target in sight. Waiting for command.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.200
<i>Stop him!</i>

26:02.640 --> 26:04.280
<i>Target on the ground.</i>

26:07.280 --> 26:09.320
<i>-Fronts, advance.</i>
-Shots have been fired.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.800
Status report?

26:18.800 --> 26:19.680
Shit.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.600
That's still a child.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.880
<i>No pulse. I repeat, we have no pulse.</i>

26:32.240 --> 26:35.160
Have the entire building searched
for the explosives.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.360
Ok.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.480
Look. From a traffic camera
in Denmark.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.640
Remove every trace of Ragna

26:57.720 --> 27:00.480
and that the photo
was taken by a traffic camera, ok?

27:00.560 --> 27:01.560
Ok.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.680
<i>In Berlin-NeukÃ¶lln,</i>

27:03.760 --> 27:08.000
<i>the police stormed the apartment of a</i>
<i>suspected Islamist terror cell today.</i>

27:08.080 --> 27:11.400
<i>Officers arrested five</i>
<i>high-profile suspects.</i>

27:11.480 --> 27:12.880
<i>During the operation,</i>

27:12.960 --> 27:16.840
<i>a 14-year-old boy was shot</i>
<i>by special forces while fleeing.</i>

27:27.480 --> 27:28.840
Hey, Inger.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.440
I saw the news.
Was that your operation?

27:32.360 --> 27:34.560
Yes, we killed a 14-year old boy.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.840
I'm sorry. I know how you feel.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.440
Why are you calling?

27:41.120 --> 27:45.720
We got a picture of the German.
He calls himself Brehme or Schulz.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.760
Send it over. We'll have a look.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.600
There's something else.
I'll send someone over.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.160
Special Ops.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.200
Trained in surveillance.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.640
<i>I need you to meet him.</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:01.040
Special Ops?

28:01.800 --> 28:03.760
What kind of threat
are we talking about?

28:06.200 --> 28:08.880
I'm afraid
it's as extreme as it gets.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.560
We need him. Both of us.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.760
Okay, I'll meet him.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.640
<i>Kathi...</i>

28:16.040 --> 28:17.760
This has to stay
between you and me.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.400
It will.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.800
Can you send that over to me?

28:25.880 --> 28:27.080
-Helmut.
-Yes.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.680
You have a second?

28:36.280 --> 28:37.560
Sorry about the boy.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.160
Can you find out who this is
without anyone knowing?

28:49.440 --> 28:51.280
Do you only have this one photo?

28:51.360 --> 28:54.240
And two aliases.
He calls himself Schulz or Brehme.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.040
What?

29:06.080 --> 29:08.480
This will take a moment.
I'll be in touch.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.960
Ok.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.040
Thank you.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.680
Really? Lofoten?

29:18.760 --> 29:20.920
Yeah. Lofoten. Yes.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.960
-VesterÃ¥len.
-Yeah, that's right.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.680
I've actually never been. But I hear
it's beautiful. I've seen pictures.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.560
-May I kidnap you two for a moment?
-That's too bad.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.120
Would you please come with me.
Both of you.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.160
Yes, sure. Nice meeting you.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.720
I want you to meet my
real life online community.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.720
Those who know
what I really stand for.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.360
<i>A spokesman for the</i>
<i>Federal Ministry of the Interior said</i>

29:47.440 --> 29:51.440
<i>that the success of the operation</i>
<i>was due to the excellent cooperation</i>

29:51.520 --> 29:54.280
<i>of all state and federal</i>
<i>counter-terrorism authorities.</i>

29:54.360 --> 29:57.760
<i>Officers arrested five</i>
<i>high-profile suspects.</i>

29:57.840 --> 29:59.960
<i>After the 14-year-old's death,</i>

30:00.040 --> 30:03.720
<i>there were spontaneous demonstrations</i>
<i>in NeukÃ¶lln and Kreuzberg...</i>

30:03.800 --> 30:06.400
Well, that's a suitable introduction.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.480
Exactly the reason why we meet.

30:09.560 --> 30:15.320
So, my friends, I'd love to introduce
you to Vera and her husband Terje.

30:15.400 --> 30:20.040
And all of you already
actually know Vera.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.400
Her writing is fundamental
to let our ideas grow.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.480
So everybody, this is Furia.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.440
What a great pleasure.
Nice to meet you. Daniel.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.720
Welcome, it's a pleasure to meet you.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.720
These Muslims...
they don't understand

30:41.800 --> 30:44.520
that planning terror
can be dangerous for your kids.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.320
-You've seen this?
-No, I haven't.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.280
How do we make people understand
the real danger?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.160
By telling them real stories.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.840
I think in fact you should all
listen to my wife tell you a story.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.400
That's how she convinced me.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.120
Go ahead.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.360
Tell them about Gothenburg.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.240
Tell them about your ex-boyfriend
who resigned.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.760
-And accepted.
-Yeah.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.680
This was back in 2016,

31:15.760 --> 31:18.440
when there was this wave
of Muslims from the Syrian war

31:18.520 --> 31:20.880
sweeping over the borders
of Germany and Sweden.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.160
Yeah, so, it was 2016.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.920
I had just started to write,
actually.

31:29.680 --> 31:34.200
And I was visiting Gothenburg
with my boyfriend at the time.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.760
And we'd been to
one of the anti-immigration rallies.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.600
So tensions were high in the
streets. To say the least.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.080
And we were in this alley.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.960
There was a concert in the building
next to us, so the music was loud.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.960
<i>I was going home.</i>

31:53.040 --> 31:55.440
In this alley, my boyfriend and I.

31:57.120 --> 32:01.360
And then, suddenly, we're surrounded
by this gang of brown faces.

32:04.760 --> 32:09.200
Young, aggressive Muslim boys.

32:11.640 --> 32:16.640
They had beards and dark-glowing
eyes and they were all around us.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.360
Eight Muslim assholes just kicked
the shit out of my boyfriend.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.720
Yeah. So I haven't seen my...

32:44.320 --> 32:47.120
ex-boyfriend since. Or Gothenburg.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.640
Yeah.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.920
That's a...

32:53.240 --> 32:55.720
a strong reminder
what their culture is.

32:55.800 --> 32:56.800
Yeah.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.760
And what about
your letters to Cato?

33:01.840 --> 33:03.520
Have you two ever met?

33:06.400 --> 33:09.720
If you'll just excuse me.
I need to talk to my husband.

33:09.800 --> 33:10.600
Of course.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.360
Thomas.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.040
It's been way too long, man.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
You ok?

33:42.960 --> 33:43.920
I don't know if...

33:55.080 --> 33:57.520
<i>Have you talked to Cato recently?</i>

33:57.600 --> 33:59.240
<i>No, of course not.</i>

34:00.040 --> 34:01.040
<i>Her writing is good.</i>

34:01.120 --> 34:03.960
<i>Furia meets our purpose</i>
<i>and the effects are the real thing.</i>

34:04.760 --> 34:06.360
Our attacks need her.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.040
This was...
updated like you asked for.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.160
And this one is for her.

34:13.240 --> 34:15.680
I had to put in
some security matters.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.760
Ok.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.240
Thank you.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.680
-Take care of yourself.
-You too. See you.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.920
-I was looking for you.
-Okay?

34:38.680 --> 34:41.480
Yeah. You just left me up there
with all those people.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.360
What?
Are you tired of being the star?

34:47.120 --> 34:48.080
What's that?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.120
Just some equipment.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.840
Where did you get it?

34:52.920 --> 34:54.280
Don't worry about that. Come!

35:21.800 --> 35:22.600
Hi.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.480
Hi.

35:27.160 --> 35:33.640
I just stopped by with some stuff.
I went shopping, so, you know...

35:33.720 --> 35:35.560
Give it to her.

35:36.240 --> 35:38.720
Some unicorn stuff...

35:39.840 --> 35:43.040
A sewing machine and some...

35:43.960 --> 35:45.600
Just a few things that she likes.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.920
So I'm...

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
So then I'm ready to leave.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.880
And you have control here...

35:54.960 --> 35:58.120
It'll be fine. I'm taking care of
her. She's having a good time.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.720
-What is she doing now?
-She's on the computer.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.760
Playing games? Ok.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.240
I don't want to make a big deal
out of this, like a big farewell.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.240
So, I'm thinking, I'll leave now,

36:12.320 --> 36:14.720
then I'll call her from the car
in a couple of hours,

36:14.800 --> 36:16.920
and I'll be gone for a few days.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.720
It may not be for just a few days.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.640
You have to say goodbye.
She wants that.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.640
Yeah, but it'll just be
a big deal and...

36:22.720 --> 36:23.640
Michelle?

36:24.640 --> 36:26.760
Come down here and say bye to daddy.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.240
Hey.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.160
Ok, Michelle. Now...

36:38.480 --> 36:40.560
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.240
Good.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.760
-I found him.
-Who?

37:17.840 --> 37:18.840
Brehme.

37:19.360 --> 37:23.120
I knew I'd heard that name before.
It's related to the Russian money.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.400
-The cryptocurrency?
-Yes.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.120
We have an undercover agent
in one of these radical groups.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.240
He claims that
they are financed with bitcoin.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.720
I tried to reach him,
but I haven't succeeded yet.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.120
He always talked about
someone behind the scenes

37:34.200 --> 37:36.160
who was in direct contact with
the Russians.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.800
Then he picked up a name.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.880
Brehme.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.680
So Brehme is a guy
we've already been looking for?

37:42.760 --> 37:43.760
Yes.

37:46.400 --> 37:50.640
And suddenly you have this
picture of him. From where?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.320
I can't tell you that.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.600
Why not?

37:57.520 --> 38:00.040
I'm sorry,
I can't explain it to you just yet.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.200
We need to contact
your undercover agent.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.400
And nobody should know
that we have this photo.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.440
The office has been
cleared and disinfected.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.840
Every single hard drive destroyed.

38:42.920 --> 38:46.000
We must rebuild our infrastructure.
Sure it was it worth it?

38:46.720 --> 38:47.720
Certain.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.520
Chris, I know how much
time and energy

38:50.600 --> 38:53.240
you've invested
in our dark web accounts.

38:53.320 --> 38:56.640
I know how much you care
about our safety.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.400
I wanted to thank you for that.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.360
We will set up
our new headquarters here.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.680
I want to show you something.

39:09.400 --> 39:13.840
Up here was the radiology department,
while the wall was still standing.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.200
After that, nobody wanted to be
treated here again.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.080
Can you recommend a book?

39:26.160 --> 39:27.840
I miss dad. And you. Sigrid

39:36.840 --> 39:37.840
Sigrid...

39:39.480 --> 39:40.840
has written to me.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.440
She's read some books I recommended.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.520
Yeah, I was going to
get in touch with her.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.080
What are we doing here?

39:59.160 --> 40:03.160
Waiting. Until it's safe for us
to travel into Berlin.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.040
Here, for example.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.240
Lots of space.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.440
Ah, here...

40:15.520 --> 40:17.360
-Could become a server room.
-Yes.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.200
Solid door.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.560
Yes, it's tight.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.280
You know why nobody came here

40:30.360 --> 40:31.840
-after the fall of the wall?
-No.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.600
Because this hospital was
state of the art in the 60s.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.480
They just had to
x-ray you three times,

40:37.560 --> 40:41.040
and your risk of cancer
increased by 50 percent.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.640
What are you doing, Brehme?

40:42.720 --> 40:45.080
We could x-ray you now, Chris.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.520
Funny.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.080
Without electricity?

40:56.760 --> 40:58.480
Open the fucking door now!

40:59.040 --> 41:00.920
I don't know exactly
how it works either.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.200
Really old technology.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.680
Let me out!

41:07.440 --> 41:08.440
Look.

41:10.760 --> 41:15.800
We have gathered chat logs from
refugee camps all around Germany.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.720
They are using
an app called Yathrib.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.800
And when you read those messages

41:21.880 --> 41:24.120
you understand that they
have not come in peace.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.800
Hundreds of thousands of refugees
come to Germany,

41:27.880 --> 41:31.040
and if we look at Europe,
we're talking about millions.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.160
They're too many and they'll
attack us sooner or later.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.800
Then it's war.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.360
But this is just technical stuff.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.360
What's important here is...

41:45.400 --> 41:46.440
it's you.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.760
Because when the war comes...

41:52.720 --> 41:55.520
it's up to you
to preserve our legacy.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.360
See how they flock around you.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.280
You fascinate and inspire people.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.400
Let me out, Brehme!

42:12.480 --> 42:13.800
Jan stays here.

42:14.360 --> 42:18.960
He'll let you out if you can tell me
why our cryptocurrency was blown.

42:19.640 --> 42:23.200
And why they have
a fucking picture of me!

42:27.160 --> 42:30.480
When I was in Norway,
you were responsible for our safety.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.560
Sorry to disturb you. There are two
men who want to speak to you.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.640
What is it?

43:08.720 --> 43:11.880
I don't know. They just came here
and insisted on seeing you.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.440
What's going on?

43:16.880 --> 43:19.120
-Brehme wants to see her.
-Why?

43:19.800 --> 43:22.160
That's not for you to ask.
Let's go.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.320
Jan...

43:32.880 --> 43:34.600
Please open the door.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Hey!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.360
What kind of ass are you?

43:43.240 --> 43:45.320
What if this shit works?

43:45.400 --> 43:46.800
He'll grill me!

43:50.040 --> 43:51.520
I want out of here!

43:53.400 --> 43:56.600
