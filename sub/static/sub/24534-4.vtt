WEBVTT

00:56.510 --> 00:57.590
Let's get this over with.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.925
We... We can wait.

01:02.850 --> 01:04.556
Until he's buried, at least.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.393
You took us there, we'd talk.
That was the deal.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.600
Ask what you want to ask.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.986
How did you end up here?

01:25.660 --> 01:26.820
That's a big question.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.087
Sometimes, those are
the easiest ones to answer.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.966
There was one day...

01:42.390 --> 01:46.679
When we could have stopped
all of this from happening.

01:50.190 --> 01:51.509
Let's start there.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.606
Tell me about that day.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.391
How long had it been
since they’d showed up?

02:37.490 --> 02:38.730
A couple of weeks.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.258
We started to stretch our rations
with cattle feed.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.091
Have you ever eaten cattle feed?

03:06.640 --> 03:08.301
Lemme tell you...

03:09.230 --> 03:11.266
It's an acquired taste.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.066
You okay?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.195
I'm fine.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.656
Allow me to be of assistance.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.035
No, let's save it.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.701
It's the last we have.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.951
Yeah, when the pancakes get better.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.410
For when things get better.

03:38.050 --> 03:38.914
That's right.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.251
This is far too significant a condiment

03:41.340 --> 03:42.671
for cattle feed pancakes.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.846
For when things get better.

03:47.390 --> 03:48.425
That can happen.

03:49.770 --> 03:50.976
It already did for us.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.647
Even if it feels not like that right now.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.101
Things will get better.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.232
Shouldn't we be eating the cattle
before we eat their feed?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.561
No one's killing anything
that moves today.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.320
We're sailing out even farther?

04:07.410 --> 04:09.537
We've already been everywhere
within 50 miles of here.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.326
Everywhere we thought
there might be food.

04:11.410 --> 04:12.957
I started to get creative.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.952
I thought of places our friends
in the parking lot may not have hit.

04:16.040 --> 04:16.950
Bowling alley?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.200
Who knows?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.256
Maybe they have nachos.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.876
Cheese that comes from a can.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.960
Where we going?

04:24.510 --> 04:25.716
"We?"

04:25.800 --> 04:28.507
No one goes out alone,
and I still have half the county to grid.

04:30.890 --> 04:31.845
Let's go.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.049
Going on runs that day”

04:40.400 --> 04:42.140
That was our first misstep.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.769
Now, remember,

04:44.860 --> 04:46.111
no spines,

04:46.200 --> 04:48.020
no purple, no black.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.611
You know I went to A&M, right?

04:52.200 --> 04:55.033
Spent more time smoking the plants
than I did studying them, but...

04:55.790 --> 04:57.496
I know which ones are safe to eat.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.212
All right, I told you something.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.756
Now you tell me something.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.080
About what?

05:06.180 --> 05:08.000
About you.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.800
I didn't go to A&M.

05:13.850 --> 05:15.010
Look here.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.853
It appears our search has borne fruit.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.475
I'll see if there's a cart.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.059
How long you gonna keep doing that?

05:28.870 --> 05:29.905
Doing what?

05:30.740 --> 05:32.367
Acting like you're afraid of me.

05:33.370 --> 05:35.702
Ah, I assure you,

05:35.790 --> 05:38.122
that is not the case.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.370
Well, then what is it?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.546
Were you afraid of him?

05:43.090 --> 05:45.001
No. Of course not.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.926
What did you think of him?

05:49.010 --> 05:50.637
I thought we were talking about Nick.

05:51.760 --> 05:52.840
Talking about you.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.106
Oh, man.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.396
Heads up!

06:05.070 --> 06:06.230
I see him.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.640
Ah!

06:51.370 --> 06:52.405
Thanks.

06:54.660 --> 06:55.786
Pricks.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.122
Saw it on my map
when my mom brought us out here.

07:05.670 --> 07:08.127
I know it's crazy,
but it felt like a sign.

07:09.590 --> 07:10.670
Of what?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.421
We're not gonna find food in the library.

07:12.510 --> 07:13.545
I know.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.477
You coming or not?

07:24.150 --> 07:26.562
I went because
Nick wanted me to.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.897
I thought it would be good for me.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.066
I thought it would be good for him.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.736
You really taking that?

08:12.950 --> 08:14.986
Nick, what are we doing here?

08:15.660 --> 08:17.480
Books, we need books.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.286
- For what?
- For a library.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.242
People need a reason to fight, Lucy.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.036
People need a reason
to want to stick around.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.621
It can't all just be about food.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.331
Nick, there's nothing left.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.047
There's gotta be something.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.510
This is about her, isn't it?

08:45.150 --> 08:46.856
She thinks they're looking out for them,

08:46.940 --> 08:48.430
she thinks they're like family.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.600
I was just like her.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.988
At the
colon/a
, I believed
in what we were doing.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.696
I thought it was a good place to be,
but it wasn't.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.399
I just couldn't see it.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.455
And you helped me.

09:08.710 --> 09:11.042
And we'll help her, just not like this.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.420
But you cou/dn ’t help her,
could you?

09:21.220 --> 09:22.460
She killed Nick.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.186
What do you think?

09:41.030 --> 09:41.985
Hey.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.032
You know, I used to be a police officer.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.337
And I knew a guy back on the force.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.963
He'd drink a bottle of rye whisky
for dinner every night.

09:59.050 --> 10:00.881
Day in, day out.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.346
Then one day,

10:05.430 --> 10:08.012
he survived a close call with a suspect.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.512
Stole a garbage truck,

10:10.610 --> 10:13.431
squashed his patrol car flat as a pancake.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.948
You know, he only went one week
without that rye.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.498
What I come away with was,

10:25.580 --> 10:28.287
takes more than one bad afternoon,

10:28.370 --> 10:29.667
or a good one,

10:29.750 --> 10:30.990
to turn somebody.

10:32.380 --> 10:36.202
So I'm guessing once we pay our respects,
you're gonna be on your way, huh?

10:36.300 --> 10:38.040
Back on the old course.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.249
Tsk.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.794
I'm telling you...

10:45.180 --> 10:47.671
I'm telling you, I'm gonna find her.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.839
Iam.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.897
And I want you with me when I do.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.101
I want you to meet her.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.447
I want her to meet you.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.366
I just want to see him buried, John.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.998
And then, yes, I will be on my way.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.417
Man, I'm better on my own.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.080
We can stop.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.380
If it's too much.

11:25.970 --> 11:27.267
Too much?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.009
It's okay.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.516
You just...

11:34.230 --> 11:35.515
Your brother just...

11:38.280 --> 11:39.645
Yeah, he did.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.610
Man, I used to love these places.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.740
You ever been?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.330
Been a while.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.546
Just you?

11:58.510 --> 11:59.545
No.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.920
Places like this...

12:03.220 --> 12:04.926
They made really good churros.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.920
Yeah, they did.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.312
This is a good one.
We should take this back with us.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.941
Height's good if you get caught
with the dead around you.

12:28.030 --> 12:31.158
_ Run flat tires.
Gets mileage, but holds a lot of gas.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.706
It's even got a tape deck.

12:44.890 --> 12:45.925
No keys, though.

12:47.930 --> 12:49.591
How do you know so much about cars?

12:51.140 --> 12:52.220
I don't know that much.

12:57.020 --> 12:58.055
Come on.

13:12.910 --> 13:14.571
Looks like people lived here.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.457
Mmm-hmm. Till the fences gave.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.261
Whoever was camped here

14:13.350 --> 14:15.671
moved to higher ground
when the fence went down.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.476
Looks like they barricaded the stairs.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.315
There.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.856
That's how we get up.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.730
Think we can make it?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.497
Yeah, we can make it.

14:45.090 --> 14:47.877
So what's your record of churros
in a single visit?

14:48.430 --> 14:49.465
Four.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.086
I was having fun.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.716
May have been high on chlorine.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.067
Well, that's worse than
Band-Aids in the water.

15:10.820 --> 15:11.866
Then what happened?

15:13.330 --> 15:15.651
I just wanted to do the right thing.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.912
There's a reason why
we haven't been on a run before.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.927
Look, if you don't like me,
you can just tell me.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.045
I do.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.807
That's why I didn't want to
give you a chance to get to know me.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.896
I've, uh, done things.

15:48.190 --> 15:50.772
I keep this to remind me

15:50.860 --> 15:53.101
that I don't want to_become
that man again.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.281
Just looks like a piece of rock to me.

16:07.090 --> 16:08.205
It's not.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.547
So, going on the run
brought you closer together.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.459
Of course it did.

16:17.430 --> 16:20.263
We were the only people there
still breathing.

16:43.580 --> 16:44.535
Go.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.375
Ah!

18:05.500 --> 18:06.956
There's still some ammo.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.075
We should grab the extra.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.586
Naomi!

18:46.790 --> 18:47.950
Hang on!

19:16.360 --> 19:18.066
When did you sharpen it?

19:21.280 --> 19:22.611
That came later.

19:24.410 --> 19:25.445
Keep talking.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.800
Check this out.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.349
Okay, this stuff's really hard to come by.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.520
We gotta take
as much of this back as we can.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.405
Thanks.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.255
Here.

20:23.090 --> 20:24.170
Take a look.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.751
Maybe those people missed this whole area.

20:29.180 --> 20:31.091
This might not be
the only place around here

20:31.180 --> 20:32.727
those people haven't picked over.

20:32.810 --> 20:35.608
I thought I saw some buildings
off the road back there.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.970
We could drive out there, maybe.

20:41.570 --> 20:42.605
Naomi?

20:44.490 --> 20:45.559
So what happened?

20:45.660 --> 20:46.809
Did she run?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.281
We were all running.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.755
Victor?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.091
What the hell, man? Where are we?

21:22.860 --> 21:25.442
I've been loading this
with provisions since the crops failed.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.117
There's enough in here to last...
Maybe a month.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.860
Why are you showing me this?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.825
There's enough room in here for two.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.376
This food, the stadium...

21:44.470 --> 21:45.835
Victor, people are hungry.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.387
What's here would barely feed
everyone for a day.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.210
Yeah, and that day could be the difference

21:50.310 --> 21:52.380
between people making it
and not making it.

21:52.470 --> 21:53.630
So can this.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.358
I did things before I met you.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.647
People got hurt. People died.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.447
At times, for no other reason
than my own self-preservation.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.100
I wanna live.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.327
There's famine on our horizon.

22:10.410 --> 22:13.072
And this,
this is how I ensure I survive it.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.821
How we both survive it.

22:15.370 --> 22:16.780
You want to get to know me?

22:19.960 --> 22:21.200
This is me.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.462
I'm sorry, Victor, I can't do that.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.016
I didn't think so.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.777
I'll drive myself back.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.936
You got everything you need right here.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.036
So, did you leave?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.200
Strand?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.706
You think this is your fault.

23:04.670 --> 23:05.705
Why?

23:05.800 --> 23:07.040
It's not his fault.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.137
He wasn't the only one
that thought about leaving.

23:38.830 --> 23:39.785
Shit.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.706
Second time you ran out on me
since we met.

23:50.130 --> 23:51.836
You don't have to tell us
where you came from

23:51.930 --> 23:53.579
or what happened to you.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.217
You don't have to tell us anything. But...

23:56.310 --> 23:58.881
You're either with us,
trying to keep this going,

23:58.980 --> 24:00.129
or you're not.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.357
I just can't do it again.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.022
I just... I can't.

24:10.530 --> 24:11.565
Do what?

24:12.240 --> 24:14.310
Try to keep this going.

24:16.870 --> 24:18.610
I did the same thing once.

24:21.410 --> 24:24.038
I went off on my own.
Nobody could've talked me out of it.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.120
Then I realised it wasn't

24:27.210 --> 24:29.508
where I wanted to be, not really.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.170
Maybe you will, too.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.516
Let's get you some gas.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.146
What about you?

24:46.230 --> 24:48.221
Did you think about leaving?

24:49.940 --> 24:50.895
Yes.

24:51.780 --> 24:52.986
We all did.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.827
We have to go.

24:58.910 --> 25:00.821
There could be something for her.

25:00.910 --> 25:03.572
Records or cassettes or CD5.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.535
Something.

26:00.140 --> 26:01.801
Lucy, I'm sorry,
we shouldn't have come here.

26:01.890 --> 26:03.175
I don't want to
end up like that.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.259
We're not gonna end up like that.

26:04.350 --> 26:06.386
We're not gonna give up, okay?
Things are gonna get better.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.515
This Isn ’t the
colon/a.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.431
Maybe it is.
Maybe we just haven't realised it.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.977
No. We know what's wrong,
we're trying to fix it.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.719
Maybe we just can't!

26:13.820 --> 26:15.481
What if we found a new place?

26:15.900 --> 26:17.197
What if we started over?

26:17.280 --> 26:18.406
New fields, new crops...

26:18.490 --> 26:20.617
We've done it before, we can do it again.

26:20.700 --> 26:21.940
Where would we go?

26:26.870 --> 26:28.918
First page we open to,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.627
that's where we go.

26:30.710 --> 26:32.120
That's where we start over.

26:32.210 --> 26:33.746
That's where we take everyone.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.421
What page did it open to?

26:40.850 --> 26:42.920
Whatever page it was,

26:43.010 --> 26:45.592
it's the reason _
you're snttlng here, Isn't It?

26:47.940 --> 26:50.147
I never should have opened that book.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.366
You need help with something?

27:45.950 --> 27:47.656
Got any relish in there?

28:07.930 --> 28:10.478
You finished the relish already,
haven't you?

28:11.850 --> 28:14.899
And the ketchup, and the mustard.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.562
Always go through all the condiments

28:18.650 --> 28:21.528
trying to dress up the things
you really don't want to eat.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.361
Smell pretty good, don't they?

28:24.450 --> 28:26.020
Considering they're from a can.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.075
So...

28:30.250 --> 28:32.992
Where you sending everyone
out to these days?

28:33.080 --> 28:35.412
So you can beat us there?

28:35.500 --> 28:37.036
I don't think so.

28:37.130 --> 28:38.700
You know, Madison,

28:38.800 --> 28:40.119
every time you send someone out

28:40.210 --> 28:42.258
there's a chance they might not come back.

28:42.340 --> 28:43.375
They'll be back.

28:43.470 --> 28:44.505
You sure?

28:44.590 --> 28:45.750
I know my people.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.555
Okay.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.885
Did I ever tell you the story about

28:50.980 --> 28:53.346
where Ennis and I were
before I packed up the bus?

28:53.440 --> 28:57.058
I used to live just like you fine folks.

28:57.150 --> 29:00.813
Well, not in a baseball stadium,
nothing quite that unusual, but...

29:00.900 --> 29:03.858
It was a settlement.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.441
My family's cattle ranch
in the hill country,

29:06.530 --> 29:08.327
two or three other families.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.111
It was a really nice place to be.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.919
Then some wildfires kicked up
about 30 miles away...

29:18.000 --> 29:19.991
I know where
you're going with this.

29:20.090 --> 29:21.626
You were smart.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.916
You saw what was coming,

29:24.630 --> 29:27.337
tried to warn everyone else,
but they didn't listen.

29:28.930 --> 29:31.421
So, you and your brother left
before the fires hit.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.852
I'm sorry about the rest of your family.

29:40.690 --> 29:42.180
People are stubborn creatures.

29:43.570 --> 29:44.605
Weenie?

29:45.700 --> 29:46.735
I'm good.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.443
If you didn't come out here
for the food or the...

29:52.540 --> 29:55.998
...company, what are you doing here?

29:59.250 --> 30:01.457
To tell you that my offer still stands.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.508
You want relish, I'm sure we could
scrounge up a packet or two

30:04.590 --> 30:05.875
in the concession stands.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.348
We could all make a go of it in there,

30:09.430 --> 30:10.920
if we just work together.

30:12.930 --> 30:15.137
You genuinely believe that, don't you?

30:15.230 --> 30:16.265
I do.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.761
That's why this place is gonna fall.

30:27.570 --> 30:29.652
Oh, I'm not gonna join you.

30:31.870 --> 30:34.657
You had the story wrong, by the way,
about me and Ennis leaving.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.536
I convinced everyone to stay.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.321
I told them we could save the place.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.080
And they listened.

30:45.630 --> 30:47.871
Then the fires got close, and...

30:50.800 --> 30:53.428
My brother and I were
the only ones that made it out alive.

30:55.850 --> 30:57.511
We could hear them dying.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.766
Screaming as we drove off.

31:14.830 --> 31:17.321
So that's why
this day was so important.

31:17.410 --> 31:19.321
Because you decided to leave,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.820
because you gave up on the stadium.

31:28.380 --> 31:29.460
Here we go.

31:50.110 --> 31:52.658
I was a nurse in ICU.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.868
I saw a lot of car accidents,
lot of strokes.

31:57.410 --> 32:00.994
After a while, you knew
who was gonna make it and who wasn't.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.121
You gotta talk to your mom.

32:07.130 --> 32:08.449
The stadium...

32:09.050 --> 32:10.506
It's not gonna last.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.922
You gotta start thinking about
where you're gonna go next.

32:16.350 --> 32:17.590
I'll talk to her.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.896
You think you know
what happened that day,

32:31.990 --> 32:33.400
but you're wrong.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.377
Where's Victor?

32:44.460 --> 32:45.529
Is he okay?

33:02.940 --> 33:05.511
Why'd you bring back
the supplies for everyone?

33:06.860 --> 33:09.226
Why not just try to get Cole
to keep it a secret?

33:11.320 --> 33:14.733
I got a little reminder
of what I stood to lose.

33:27.580 --> 33:28.877
And what did people think

33:28.960 --> 33:30.837
when they found out
about your escape hatch?

33:40.470 --> 33:42.552
Wow. Looks like
you guys had a big day.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.301
Finally caught a break, right?

33:45.060 --> 33:47.722
But, boy, we were due! Good work.

33:51.650 --> 33:54.528
I didn’t tell them the truth.
I was the one who packed it.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.900
So, are you gonna tell me?

34:03.580 --> 34:05.400
What page did it open to?

34:08.210 --> 34:09.871
I guess we're going north.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.047
Wonder how the soil is up there.

34:21.220 --> 34:23.427
Lucy, what if there's another way
of looking at this?

34:24.270 --> 34:25.635
I don't understand.

34:26.810 --> 34:28.437
Where did the book take you?

34:34.190 --> 34:35.236
What'd you find?

34:35.320 --> 34:37.902
Okay, what if we went
farther than anywhere on these maps,

34:37.990 --> 34:40.618
_ farther_than those assholes
In the parking lot have scavenged?

34:42.790 --> 34:44.906
Nick, we can't go that far out
every time we need something.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.536
No, we only need to do it once.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.952
We find seeds,
we find fertilizers, we replant.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.872
You know? We turn this place
back into what it was.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.092
Okay. I'll go tell the others.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.426
Good work.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.885
Thanks for today.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.016
Hey, replanting was your idea.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.681
I'm just glad we're gonna do it here.

35:27.660 --> 35:28.706
Mom.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.160
We need to talk.

35:35.250 --> 35:36.877
You told her about Naomi r/ght?

35:39.380 --> 35:40.426
No.

35:49.810 --> 35:51.220
Were you always right?

35:51.310 --> 35:53.608
The ICU.
The patients you thought would die.

35:54.860 --> 35:56.100
They ever live?

35:59.440 --> 36:01.817
No, I let Naomi do her own talking.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.071
Nice wheels.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.416
What else did you find?

36:12.210 --> 36:13.871
Even if we make it work here,

36:13.960 --> 36:16.292
things are gonna get worse
before they get better.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.796
I want to help set up an infirmary.

36:25.430 --> 36:26.636
And I'm gonna help.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.095
I don ’t understand

36:29.180 --> 36:30.636
You stayed at the stadium,

36:30.730 --> 36:31.970
you fought for it.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.681
Why is that the day everything changed?

36:36.860 --> 36:39.818
We should have talked my mom into leaving.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.855
I should have followed my gut.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.690
I should have kept that car a secret.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.942
We should have flipped to another page.

36:50.950 --> 36:53.111
We should have found someplace else to go.

36:54.460 --> 36:55.996
But we wanted to believe.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.120
We wanted to stay.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.586
I wanted to be a better person.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.046
That's why my brother is dead.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.171
That's why Nick is dead.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.506
That's why my friend is dead.

37:10.350 --> 37:12.261
We could have stopped it all.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.075
Is this it?

38:16.750 --> 38:17.785
This is it.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.795
Why here?

38:30.050 --> 38:31.711
What difference
does it make to you?

38:31.810 --> 38:34.552
I... I just wanted to know.

38:52.870 --> 38:54.690
Oh, this isn't about Nick, is it?

38:55.580 --> 38:57.207
You're going after the rest of them.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.201
Even after what happened to him?

39:00.290 --> 39:01.336
It's what Nick wanted.

39:01.420 --> 39:02.455
You don't know that.

39:03.590 --> 39:04.625
You didn't know Nick.

39:07.050 --> 39:08.620
You've been lying to me this whole time.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.335
We had a deal.

39:10.430 --> 39:12.967
To answer your questions. And we did.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.591
The answers only matter
if they're the truth.

39:16.770 --> 39:17.805
They are.

39:17.890 --> 39:19.050
Maybe.

39:19.140 --> 39:21.608
But you served them to me
between two slices of bullshit,

39:21.690 --> 39:23.180
so how am I supposed
to tell the difference?

39:23.940 --> 39:25.066
Sniff before you bite.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.317
Good luck finding them without me.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.195
We don't need you any more.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.861
Alicia found this

39:32.950 --> 39:35.236
on our friend with the El Camino.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.571
They spilt off across the landscape

39:39.660 --> 39:41.457
and reassemble with their gains.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.627
We know where they meet up next.

39:44.630 --> 39:45.836
You just needed a ride here.

39:46.510 --> 39:47.795
You got snookered, Al.

39:49.130 --> 39:51.792
So you're all really gonna lug all of this

39:52.390 --> 39:53.789
wherever the Vultures are meeting?

39:54.470 --> 39:55.505
Depends.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.300
You offering to drive?

39:58.060 --> 39:59.596
Don't take them, Al. Take me.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.182
Their story just ends up
with more people getting hurt.

40:03.270 --> 40:04.305
Mine doesn't.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.226
There's a lot of our story you don't know.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.526
Give me one reason I can believe

40:11.610 --> 40:13.521
anything you tell me from here on out.

40:13.990 --> 40:15.821
We don't have to tell you anything.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.036
You want the truth?

40:18.200 --> 40:20.111
You want to know how this ends?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.206
Come see it for yourself.

40:31.970 --> 40:33.005
Load up.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.307
But you're still planning on
burying your brother, right?

40:41.600 --> 40:43.977
You're not just gonna
leave him on the side of the road?

40:48.280 --> 40:49.315
We'll bury him here.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.025
Here.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.826
He liked growing things, right?

42:04.850 --> 42:05.885
Hey.

42:06.940 --> 42:08.225
Where'd you get that?

42:10.150 --> 42:12.141
We took what we could
when we left the stadium.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.731
Guns, supplies.

42:14.650 --> 42:16.026
Put 'em in anything we could find.

42:16.110 --> 42:17.156
Could I?

42:18.200 --> 42:20.191
Please? It belonged to her.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.246
To who?

42:23.950 --> 42:24.996
Laura.

42:37.630 --> 42:40.713
Uh, we should set this stuff up
in the locker room.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.960
Just give me a second.

43:16.590 --> 43:18.126
Naomi?

43:18.220 --> 43:19.460
Her name was Naomi?

43:21.300 --> 43:22.847
She never told me her real name.

43:23.350 --> 43:24.385
Where is she?

43:25.140 --> 43:26.129
Where'd she go?

43:27.270 --> 43:28.305
Where is she?

43:30.520 --> 43:31.976
Naomi didn't make it out.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.475
The stadium.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.026
Things went wrong.

43:44.620 --> 43:45.655
What happened?

43:47.620 --> 43:48.655
She's dead.

43:52.420 --> 43:53.990
No, that's not true.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.751
She's out there.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.795
She gotta be.

43:59.840 --> 44:00.920
There's the rub.

44:01.010 --> 44:03.342
Your story did end
with someone getting hurt.

44:04.470 --> 44:05.505
Looks like you need something--

44:05.600 --> 44:06.635
Shut up.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.055
They did this.

44:14.940 --> 44:17.727
Come with us. Help us end it.

44:18.690 --> 44:19.645
John".

44:19.740 --> 44:20.695
Just let me be.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.153
Everybody, just let me be.

44:52.690 --> 44:53.805
I'll find out what happened.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.896
And I'll come back for you.

44:58.820 --> 44:59.855
Al.

45:02.570 --> 45:03.605
Go.

45:06.740 --> 45:07.775
Go.

45:38.980 --> 45:40.220
I'm sorry, John.

45:44.860 --> 45:45.906
You were right.

45:48.070 --> 45:50.026
We're always on our own.
