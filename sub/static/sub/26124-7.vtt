WEBVTT

00:23.600 --> 00:24.840
Hey, Tommy.

00:24.940 --> 00:25.929
Rudy wants to talk.

00:32.740 --> 00:33.946
Rudy. How are you?

00:34.950 --> 00:36.906
Good, Vincent, how you doin'?

00:36.990 --> 00:37.979
Good.

00:42.370 --> 00:44.952
We got a busted-out joint
over on the East Side.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.621
Could be a big moneymaker.

00:46.710 --> 00:47.950
46th and Second.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.292
Any closer to the UN,
you have to be a diplomat.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.871
- Another bar?
- For the international set.

00:54.470 --> 00:56.335
Can you find someone else?

00:56.430 --> 00:57.840
Please, Rudy.

00:57.930 --> 01:00.171
Come on, no one else got
your golden touch.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.726
I'm drowning here.

01:01.810 --> 01:04.802
This place, The Hi-Hat,
the parlors, the peeps.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.767
All right, look.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.680
Why don't you let me out
of this parlor thing?

01:08.770 --> 01:10.977
All right? You get
somebody else for that,

01:11.070 --> 01:13.231
I'll run all your bars for you, okay?

01:13.320 --> 01:16.483
- How's that sound?
- Vince, let's take a walk.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.481
Will you excuse us for a minute, Rudy?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.786
Come on.

01:26.790 --> 01:27.996
Can you clear this out?

01:29.380 --> 01:30.495
All right, people, in or out.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.161
All right, come on,
let's just go.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.331
- What's your problem?
- No problem.

01:38.430 --> 01:40.341
Gimme the new bar, gimme five of 'em,

01:40.430 --> 01:42.170
I'll run 'em all for you.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.261
Just let me walk away
from the parlors and the peeps.

01:44.350 --> 01:46.181
What, is your girlfriend
busting your balls?

01:46.270 --> 01:48.852
No. This is me talkin'. All right...

01:50.520 --> 01:54.024
Bobby, he's been handling
the parlors fine for years.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.442
Irene has the peeps well in hand.

01:56.530 --> 01:59.522
I'm like the third wheel
who's takin' money for nothin'!

01:59.620 --> 02:00.939
No. Don't underestimate yourself.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.407
What happens when you go away, huh?
What happens?

02:03.500 --> 02:06.822
All I ever wanted was a nightclub,
Tommy, that's it.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.706
That's the best of me.

02:08.790 --> 02:11.281
If you don't wanna take on
the new place, that's fine.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.621
But for all the rest,
Rudy wants you there.

02:14.550 --> 02:15.539
That's the end of it.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.428
What if I refuse? Then what happens?

02:22.260 --> 02:23.466
They find you somewhere.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.090
Fuck you.

02:29.230 --> 02:32.518
Look, I like you, Vince, all right?

02:32.610 --> 02:33.599
But okay.

02:33.690 --> 02:36.352
What would really
happen if you walked away?

02:36.440 --> 02:39.352
Bobby loses his spot in the parlor.
He's out of work.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.406
You can explain that
to his wife and kids.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.697
We give The Hi-Hat
to another one of our friends,

02:43.790 --> 02:45.280
- and Abby's out of a job...
- Come on.

02:45.370 --> 02:46.860
Basically puts you out on the street.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.782
Don't even think about opening
another bar in the city at that point,

02:50.880 --> 02:52.279
or in any of the boroughs.

02:53.290 --> 02:56.794
You're an earner for us,
Vincent. All right?

02:56.880 --> 02:59.257
You break the chain, poof!
You're gone.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.132
I have never seen someone so miserable

03:06.220 --> 03:07.881
while makin' so much money.

03:08.890 --> 03:11.438
Fuck. Come on.
Come on, let's get a drink.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.170
Hey, Vince. Everything okay?

03:49.850 --> 03:51.090
When you comin' back?

05:46.260 --> 05:48.000
You're up.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.217
Yeah, and getting a little antsy.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.420
How about we go out for breakfast?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.509
Sorry, baby.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.648
Not while Rodney's lookin' for you.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.391
He knows I'm here?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.562
No. But he's lookin'.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.190
Hey.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.941
I won't let anything happen to you.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.876
How 'bout some eggs?

06:32.720 --> 06:35.382
How many days will you be
needing the car, Mr. Martino?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.510
I don't know. Uh...

06:39.940 --> 06:41.896
Can you open-end it?

06:41.980 --> 06:44.028
I'm guessin' you'll want
something premium.

06:44.110 --> 06:46.146
Cadillac or a Lincoln, maybe?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.946
No. No, no.

06:48.030 --> 06:51.659
Just do mid-size. Mid-size.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.037
This can help. Take one.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.286
No fuckin' way.

06:57.370 --> 06:58.997
It's just a legal primer,

06:59.080 --> 07:01.287
it's got tips on how
to beat police entrapment

07:01.380 --> 07:02.916
and knock down the loitering charges.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.003
- Tanya, baby, take this.
- Fuck you doing, girl?

07:06.090 --> 07:07.876
Are they paying you for this bullshit?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.790
I'm with Ashley. You remember Ashley.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.342
- You don't remember Ashley?
- No.

07:13.430 --> 07:15.341
- Hey.
- See you later.

07:15.430 --> 07:16.670
Take this, put it in your purse.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.135
Just helpin' you with some tips

07:18.230 --> 07:19.470
on how to not get
arrested all the time.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.891
- Tough town.
- Compared to where?

07:20.980 --> 07:21.969
Cali.

07:22.060 --> 07:24.108
You mean the girls in Oakland
didn't care

07:24.190 --> 07:26.317
if their pimps saw them
talking to you?

07:26.400 --> 07:27.890
Tell me another.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.527
- What happened?
- My neck still hurts.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.906
- So how's he holding up?
- Good.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.571
Got an eight-hour nightstick,

07:38.660 --> 07:40.321
but don't get in the way
of his chores.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.496
Maybe he should tape
a feather duster to it.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.036
He could do double duty.

07:54.930 --> 07:57.421
Am I making too much noise or...

07:57.520 --> 08:00.762
- I'd rather hear that than him.
- Me, too.

08:00.850 --> 08:02.340
We're going out for lunch soon.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.509
Think about what you want.

08:51.610 --> 08:54.158
- So, is it finished?
- The movie?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.559
Almost, I think.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.400
Well, Candy wants
to reshoot some things

08:57.490 --> 08:59.287
she thinks could be better,

08:59.370 --> 09:01.247
but you should have
heard Harvey scream.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.207
He's payin' for it.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.622
Harvey says
Red Hat
is worth it.

09:05.710 --> 09:08.201
He says it's the first time
in the history of fuck films

09:08.290 --> 09:10.702
that anybody's paid
for the same real estate twice.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.789
Excuse me.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.086
I like acting.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.843
I think I like it more than
anything I've ever done before.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.436
Anything?

09:43.910 --> 09:46.788
Thank fuckin' God, air conditioning.

09:46.870 --> 09:48.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:48.210 --> 09:49.199
Move, Opie.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.621
- What's up with this?
- Social work.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.216
Social work.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.382
Is there money in that?

09:57.470 --> 09:58.539
Where's my cut?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.146
You okay, D?

10:11.860 --> 10:14.647
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.946
What are you having?

10:16.950 --> 10:17.939
What?

10:18.030 --> 10:20.828
I said, what...

10:20.910 --> 10:22.650
A High Life, please.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.367
Three of them, actually.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.226
All right, fine.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.720
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.550
All right, I'll be out front
when you're ready to go.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.435
What?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.147
You got a fuckin' problem?

11:02.990 --> 11:04.150
Bobby?

11:05.750 --> 11:06.944
Don't be mad.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.496
Room four.

11:21.590 --> 11:24.468
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah, Bobby.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.960
- Chrissake. Fuck off.
- Dad, you can't just walk In here.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.925
- There's doors, and there's...
- Wait for me at the bar.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.100
He paid for it, Bobby.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.351
I don't care if he had
C-notes flyin' out of his ass.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.738
He's here to work. That's it!

11:37.820 --> 11:40.448
He's a really nice person, your son.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.197
There he is.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.283
Superman! Ha-ha! Look at your face!

11:48.370 --> 11:49.610
It's all cleared up.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.166
I guess it is true. Huh?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.571
Come on, shut up, Uncle Frank. God.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.969
A wise wine merchant
never samples his own product.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.847
You know what that means?

12:05.930 --> 12:07.340
Don't get drunk on pussy?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.176
Darlene, how long
you gonna be in there?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.595
- Holy shit.
- Come on.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.316
You see that brown ring,
what are you gonna do?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.106
I ain't havin' a baby.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.235
Not even Larry's?

15:11.320 --> 15:12.776
Especially not Larry.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.412
Comes to that,
you should go with someone.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.910
Just let me know when.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.377
So, when are they gonna be here?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.508
- Any minute.
- Great.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.751
I'm gonna get the reels
up and running.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.422
Now remember, these are the guys
who put in the original 30.

15:34.510 --> 15:37.809
Yeah. Yeah. Guys whose names
all end in vowels.

15:37.890 --> 15:40.597
Right, so...
Hey, I need you to play nice.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.476
Why wouldn't I play nice

15:44.570 --> 15:46.970
when they helped me make my movie?

15:47.070 --> 15:50.198
And it's the movie
you wanted to make, but...

15:50.280 --> 15:52.657
But, yeah, we need another injection,

15:52.740 --> 15:54.867
these guys control
distribution and print houses.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.486
Harvey, they're gonna love it.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.241
Whether they do
or whether they do not,

15:58.330 --> 15:59.740
just please play nice.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.320
Eileen, listen to me.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.376
They didn't even want you
at this screening.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.837
They're not used to women
sitting in on business. Okay?

16:06.550 --> 16:08.836
I figured you might need to be here

16:08.920 --> 16:12.959
to explain the cinematic subtext
to them.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.132
- Fuck you.
- Hey, listen,

16:15.220 --> 16:17.051
that doesn't work,
you take your top off.

16:17.140 --> 16:19.301
That much
these gorillas'll understand.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.853
- Thank you.
- You welcome, baby girl.

16:25.810 --> 16:29.644
Ah, don't say nothin'. Let me tell it.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.446
Two scrambled,

16:31.530 --> 16:33.816
rye toast, honey,

16:33.910 --> 16:35.480
and hash browns.

16:35.570 --> 16:36.901
That's you, right?

16:36.990 --> 16:38.787
Very good, but just coffee now.

16:38.870 --> 16:40.781
Okay, cool.

16:41.790 --> 16:43.326
What you think about this?

16:45.170 --> 16:46.455
"In the Heat of the Meat."

16:47.540 --> 16:50.202
It's a porn version
of that Sidney Poitier flick.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.460
Mmm-hmm.

16:54.470 --> 16:57.542
- Why you ain't eatin'?
- I don't feel too good.

17:05.350 --> 17:07.898
I still can't believe
that you're back.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.020
Is C.C. makin' my ears burn?

17:11.110 --> 17:12.941
He don't say a word about you.

17:15.110 --> 17:19.023
So, why don't you just... You gonna
buy me some strait-laced clothes

17:19.120 --> 17:22.283
and a ticket back to Copper Island?

17:22.370 --> 17:24.110
Where?

17:24.210 --> 17:25.279
The U.P.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.370
Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.082
That's not what we do.
We're more about

17:33.170 --> 17:35.718
helpin' out the girls
in the day-to-day.

17:37.430 --> 17:38.419
Yeah?

17:39.430 --> 17:40.920
So, no bus ticket?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.390
Is that what you want?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.436
The fuck is that girl doin'?

17:51.150 --> 17:52.606
Maybe she's just talkin' to her.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.440
What was it like?

17:56.530 --> 17:58.612
Girl, what are you askin' me?

18:02.620 --> 18:04.247
Sometimes...

18:08.670 --> 18:09.910
I don't know.

18:13.090 --> 18:14.079
I don't know.

18:16.630 --> 18:17.881
I'm around.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.032
What my eyes you ha ye.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.976
That was...

19:14.070 --> 19:16.106
It's not your standard fuck film,
I'm well aware of that.

19:16.190 --> 19:17.851
- Yeah, no shit.
- It's...

19:19.320 --> 19:21.652
It's art porn.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.072
- Art porn. Mmm.
- Yeah.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.321
It's gonna bring in women
as well as men.

19:26.410 --> 19:28.708
It's gonna broaden the audience
for adult films.

19:28.790 --> 19:31.577
You're gonna be rolling in cash.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.958
Yeah, there is a bigger market
for higher-class skin flicks now.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.120
I think if we could
get a little more money,

19:37.210 --> 19:39.337
we could get some press attention.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.001
More money? For what?

19:41.090 --> 19:43.217
Once you cut out all the
fuckin' talkin', you're good to go.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.710
Hey. It's not a loop.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.263
It's a full-length feature.
It's made for theaters.

19:48.350 --> 19:51.979
It's got a story,
and for once, holy Christ,

19:52.060 --> 19:54.016
we told it pretty damn well.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.476
Come on, Marty.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.810
Help me out here.

19:58.820 --> 19:59.946
She is not wrong.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.986
We book it in theaters,
it'll run for a while.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.152
Plus, Lori's hot as balls right now.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.117
Hmm. There's no argument there.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.282
- Don't forget about Candy.
- She's still got a few moves.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.611
Hey. "She"? I'm right here.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.450
You can talk to me.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.746
I directed the ﬁlm.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.547
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm saying
that Candy has made

20:18.630 --> 20:20.586
a name for herself behind the camera.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.217
-Hmm.
- And I think

20:22.300 --> 20:24.382
we put a lady director
out in front of this.

20:24.470 --> 20:25.926
Cleans us up to people.

20:26.010 --> 20:27.250
He's right, Matty.

20:27.350 --> 20:28.965
This one we can put
the director out front,

20:29.060 --> 20:30.516
make her part of the package.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.511
It's good for the feminism part.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.351
"The feminism part"?

20:38.980 --> 20:42.734
What I mean to say is you're a broad.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.902
It's a fuck film made by a broad.

20:44.990 --> 20:47.072
It's good for us.
That's all I'm saying, come on.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.991
I'm sorry, Candy.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.149
Do me a favor.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.243
Give me a few minutes
alone with the guys. Okay?

21:00.090 --> 21:01.159
Thanks.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.518
- It's okay.
- What the fuck's her problem?

21:15.600 --> 21:17.227
It's fine, really.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.771
How much more you need
to put this thing out in front

21:21.860 --> 21:23.236
the way you want to?

21:24.780 --> 21:25.815
Now, come on,

21:25.910 --> 21:28.731
imagine if it were your mother
you had to explain this to.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.070
-Mmmmmm.
- I just didn't think

21:30.160 --> 21:31.946
I was going to ever have to do this.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.281
- Do you know the asshole? Yeah.
- Who told her?

21:35.370 --> 21:37.782
Some bastard who said he found, found,

21:37.880 --> 21:39.620
a magazine with my photo in it.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.701
- A 5177/ from
Boys in the Sand.
-Mmmmmm.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.836
Found it under his fuckin' mattress.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.717
And now I'm sitting here
trying to explain how

21:45.800 --> 21:47.631
after eight years
I've been in 22 fuck films

21:47.720 --> 21:49.130
and a Ford dealer's commercial.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.516
That many, huh?

21:54.640 --> 21:55.937
I'm kidding.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.976
Look, she loves you, right?

21:58.060 --> 22:00.642
- Yes.
- It'll be fine.

22:05.530 --> 22:07.942
- I've missed you.
- You see me all the time.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.787
- Oh.
-Mmmmmm.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.949
"Oh I ll

22:31.510 --> 22:33.762
Well, I've been thinking
about going for a while.

22:33.850 --> 22:35.306
I was hoping you'd want to tonight.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.130
Okay, sounds great.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.102
- Maybe some good wine?
- Yes.

22:45.610 --> 22:47.271
We don't get out of bed till 10.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.658
We were on our honeymoon
in Miami Beach.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.538
I'd never been south of Philly,
so that was different.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.531
Me in the room,
suffering from sunburn,

22:56.620 --> 23:00.499
and Linda walking on the strand with
all them Cuban guys leerin' at her.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.536
Can't say that I blame them.

23:02.630 --> 23:04.370
Stop it.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.508
We could use another vacation.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.626
- When's your pick?
- No time soon,

23:08.720 --> 23:12.383
but, hey, maybe I could switch
with one of the guys.

23:12.470 --> 23:15.519
Yeah, I'll just march into
McDonagh's office and demand it.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.670
Guy thinks he's James fuckin' Coburn.

23:17.770 --> 23:19.089
"Schlitz Light."

23:20.650 --> 23:21.935
Hey, that just made me thirsty.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.432
We're gonna need another one of these.
Maybe two.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.610
Someone's got a sweet tooth.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.189
It's college kids.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.655
They like a drink
that comes with cavities.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.577
I used to work behind
the stick at a Korean bar.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.911
Every drink had more colors
than a crayon box.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.581
Yeah? Where was this?

23:46.670 --> 23:48.080
Let me guess. Boston.

23:49.260 --> 23:51.080
Yeah. Manhattan.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.886
- Midtown.
- Yeah?

23:52.970 --> 23:54.130
I grew up in Washington Heights.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.006
Bay Ridge.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.806
Vincent Martino.

23:57.890 --> 24:00.802
Gerry Mullen. You still tending bar?

24:00.890 --> 24:02.846
Yeah. Just you tonight?

24:02.940 --> 24:04.726
Yeah. The other guy's wife
just had a baby.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.276
You're not messin' around this time.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.908
Why don't you try hittin' a few pins?

24:17.200 --> 24:19.691
It's them little hands. Like claws.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.377
I tried.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.990
We're bowling an 85.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.705
How you gonna fix this?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.166
Try usin' a lighter ball
the next time.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.002
Doesn't matter with her.
It's just gonna keep rollln' off.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.806
I'm home!

24:47.770 --> 24:48.771
Shay?

25:06.960 --> 25:09.121
Never mix soda pop with your liquor.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.041
Try this instead.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.916
You're gonna thank me in the morning.

25:13.930 --> 25:14.999
All right?

25:16.510 --> 25:18.501
And there.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.549
What do you think?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.017
Mmm. That's... It's really good.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.806
That's right. Wanna try one?

25:27.900 --> 25:29.765
- Sure.
- All right.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.270
You two know each other?

25:31.360 --> 25:35.148
- No. I'm Barry.
- Paula.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.481
I'm Vincent. Good to know both of you.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.867
Nice to know you.

25:38.950 --> 25:41.077
So, Vincent, what do you...
What do you call this?

25:42.160 --> 25:43.320
Have no idea.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.450
Tell you what.

25:46.540 --> 25:49.122
Why don't you two
put your heads together,

25:49.210 --> 25:50.791
come up with a good name.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.124
It's a Negroni.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.209
Shh.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.388
- Anita's not here.
- Just tell me what room,

26:00.470 --> 26:02.267
or I'm gonna start
breakin' down doors.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.887
- You even breathe in my direction...
- Hey, now, now. Bobby!

26:04.980 --> 26:06.470
I heard you the first time.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.470
Whoa, Danny, hold on.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.026
I just wanna talk to her.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.771
She's not here.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.236
You hidin' her from me?

26:15.320 --> 26:16.981
On my mother's eyes,
she's off tonight.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.368
Her next shift's tomorrow night.
You can see her then.

26:19.450 --> 26:21.111
She better be here.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.900
Fuckin' cops.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.956
So he's fuckin' yelling,

26:27.040 --> 26:29.031
his fuckin' shirt's off,
and the basketball...

26:29.130 --> 26:31.337
What did I say to you two?

26:32.630 --> 26:34.541
Relax. It's just food.

26:34.630 --> 26:35.961
Christ.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.344
That was the best night
I've had in a long time.

26:43.430 --> 26:44.636
The best.

26:45.930 --> 26:48.137
- You're livin' your life, Paul.
-Hmm.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.765
Not many do.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.396
Am I?

26:55.490 --> 26:56.809
Come here, then.

27:03.910 --> 27:07.368
She comes up to my buddy,
Tommy Longo, okay?

27:07.460 --> 27:11.624
He's ginzo, tough guy, full leather,

27:11.710 --> 27:14.543
calzone juice drippin' from his chin.

27:14.630 --> 27:17.542
She says, "Excuse me, sir,

27:17.630 --> 27:19.837
"how do I get to Columbus Circle?"

27:19.930 --> 27:22.387
"The fuckI look like, Magellan?"

27:23.970 --> 27:25.926
Welcome to fuckin' New York, huh?

27:26.020 --> 27:27.806
I liked the city when I visited.

27:27.890 --> 27:30.347
Took my mom to see
0/7! Calcutta!

27:30.440 --> 27:32.055
I didn't know!

27:32.150 --> 27:35.142
And at any rate, she fell asleep
halfway through,

27:35.230 --> 27:37.232
so no harm, no foul.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.562
What happens in
Oh! Calcutta/.7

27:40.660 --> 27:42.525
- "Calcutta"!
- Everyone gets naked.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.360
So what? By 3:00 in the mornin',

27:44.450 --> 27:46.361
I gotta throw cold water on people,

27:46.450 --> 27:48.498
make sure they don't bone
on my dance floor.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.538
Jeez! A full dance floor
at three In the morning?

27:51.620 --> 27:52.917
I gotta get back to the city.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.877
This is fun.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.666
But now the sun's caught us.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.830
- There'll be talk.
- Small-town talk.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.080
Worst kind.

28:01.090 --> 28:02.387
Are you stayin' somewheres?

28:02.470 --> 28:04.756
Nah, I was just gonna drive back.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.307
Bullshit. You're comin' with me.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.607
Jesus. You look awful.

28:19.610 --> 28:20.599
Thanks.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.769
Where were you?

28:21.860 --> 28:23.487
I...

28:23.570 --> 28:25.572
I stayed the night at the office.

28:26.660 --> 28:28.742
Not coming to the march, I take it.

28:28.830 --> 28:30.320
When are you headin' over?

28:30.410 --> 28:31.820
In a half hour.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.911
Uh... Well,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.458
I'm gonna open the townhouse early
for the party after the rally.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.415
Hey. It's okay.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.831
I figured when I woke up
and you weren't here,

28:41.930 --> 28:43.295
I'd be going stag.

28:52.350 --> 28:54.591
I wasn't sure we were
domg this anymore.

28:54.690 --> 28:58.228
We would be, if we were in
the same room and awake more often.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.605
Yeah?

29:03.700 --> 29:04.849
Half an hour?

29:04.950 --> 29:07.077
Yeah, these things
never start on time.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.151
Uh-huh? Okay.

29:10.580 --> 29:11.899
Wait, wait, wait. Let me...

29:12.000 --> 29:13.786
Let me just shower first. All right?

29:15.630 --> 29:18.952
- You knew who I was when I moved in.
- And you know I don't care,

29:19.050 --> 29:21.757
as long as what we have together
is still here.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.831
Well, opening that club took a lot.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.500
- It did.
- Right.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.467
Well, what's left?

29:37.650 --> 29:39.311
Fuck me.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.607
What are you, one of the Waltons?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.369
when we crossed the creek
and saw that falcon?

30:06.470 --> 30:09.428
Hey, Diane? This is Vince.

30:09.510 --> 30:11.592
- Hey, kids. Hey.
- Hey there, Vince.

30:12.350 --> 30:14.011
Why you already dressed
and up on a Sunday?

30:14.100 --> 30:16.307
- Nature camp, Dad.
- Oh.

30:16.390 --> 30:17.550
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.437
Vince was up all night
heroically working with me.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.272
He needs to crash
for a few hours, okay?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.237
Yeah, of course.
Guest room's all made up.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.062
- You want some orange juice?
- Yeah.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.309
Thanks.

30:32.450 --> 30:33.439
It's good.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.612
I_ don't wanna feel like I'm
workIn' around you guys anymore,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.746
everybody gettin'
all paranoid and suspicious.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.457
So let me just say, straight up,

30:40.540 --> 30:42.622
at the end of the day, you and I,

30:42.710 --> 30:44.701
we're on the same side.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.415
We want the same things.

30:46.510 --> 30:48.250
And lookin' forward,
we've been pushin'

30:48.340 --> 30:49.887
to overturn the new loitering laws,

30:49.970 --> 30:51.540
and other laws that target the girls.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.427
I mean, the ultimate goal here
is decriminalization.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.169
- Am I right?
- Decriminal-what?

30:56.270 --> 30:57.259
What could be better than that?

30:58.730 --> 30:59.845
Better?

31:04.780 --> 31:06.065
If this shit is legal,

31:07.150 --> 31:09.698
what the fuck do anyone
need a pimp for?

31:12.990 --> 31:14.571
- All right, I...
- Tell you what.

31:16.330 --> 31:19.618
Why don't you autograph
my copy for me?

31:19.710 --> 31:21.826
- Come_on.
- I'm serious.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.916
I want your John Hancock,

31:29.050 --> 31:30.210
Dave.

31:43.690 --> 31:45.601
Anything else,
mar/on?

32:00.830 --> 32:02.536
I told Joey to run
the vacuum out here.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.120
He left.

32:04.210 --> 32:05.495
He left? To where?

32:05.590 --> 32:08.206
I don't know. He said you the one
who told him to go pick up something.

32:08.300 --> 32:09.415
I did?

32:17.600 --> 32:18.885
- Hello?
- Is he there?

32:18.980 --> 32:20.345
- Who?
- Joey.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.806
- What’s wrong?
- Nothing. Just askin'.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.221
- Did you lose our son?
- Nothin', I said!

32:27.570 --> 32:30.528
Where's that girl? Where's Rachel?

32:30.610 --> 32:33.272
Rach! Rachel!

32:33.360 --> 32:36.113
I don't know, she must
have stepped out, too.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.485
We got a phone number for her?

32:37.580 --> 32:40.617
She live on Orchard, other side
of the river above the barber shop.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.200
She's friendly, what can I say?

32:42.290 --> 32:45.339
- I'll bet.
- You want me to go?

32:45.420 --> 32:46.830
No, you stay here.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.797
Make sure nobody
tries to burn us down.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.086
Got you.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.717
I don't want those fucking assholes
to touch my film.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.729
Not the cut, not the posters,
not the marketing.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.437
I'll see what I can do.

33:12.450 --> 33:13.815
Harvey.

33:15.030 --> 33:18.193
Hey, look, shitheads that they are,

33:18.280 --> 33:20.783
they're gonna spend
their money to sell your film.

33:20.870 --> 33:22.280
And you.

33:23.290 --> 33:25.110
You're gonna be known, Eileen.

33:25.210 --> 33:26.529
Or should I say "Candy"?

33:26.630 --> 33:28.416
You need to be ready for that.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.086
Known.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.250
Harvey, what about my kid?

33:40.260 --> 33:42.012
So get out in front of it.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.227
Tell him who you are.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.936
He hears it from you,
it's the best thing, right?

33:56.410 --> 33:58.116
Next bus going anywhere south,

33:58.200 --> 33:59.827
and we'll get off
when we get to Maryland.

33:59.910 --> 34:02.572
Oh, look, it's Dagwood and Blondie.

34:02.660 --> 34:03.900
What are you doing here?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.456
You got luggage and everything.

34:06.830 --> 34:08.991
We want to get away for a while.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.205
Oh, yeah?

34:11.210 --> 34:12.507
Look, Dad.

34:14.050 --> 34:15.620
We love each other.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.381
Well, that's just great.

34:17.470 --> 34:19.711
Hey, how about I give you two
a lift down to Port Authority,

34:19.800 --> 34:21.301
help get you on your way?

34:21.390 --> 34:23.301
I'm serious, okay? We're in love.

34:23.390 --> 34:25.722
In love, huh? What about you, Rach?

34:26.850 --> 34:28.056
You're in love, too?

34:31.480 --> 34:33.687
Okay, we just wanna start over.
That's it.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.271
Start over? She's a whore,
you're a high school dropout.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.238
Tell me how you two are gonna
start over. This I gotta hear.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.070
Rachel.

34:43.160 --> 34:46.288
Rachel, what are you doing?
What are you...

35:48.100 --> 35:50.512
- Your autograph?
- Yep.

35:50.600 --> 35:55.469
There I am quackin' like a duck
about medical, legal counseling,

35:55.570 --> 35:56.639
while C.C.'s starin' at me

35:58.820 --> 36:00.276
would make a good ashtray.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.521
Shit. Yeah.

36:03.570 --> 36:06.232
That's what you get
for trying to hustle hustlers.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.707
You tell Dorothy?

36:09.790 --> 36:10.996
No way. You kiddin' me?

36:12.040 --> 36:13.371
You told me.

36:13.460 --> 36:14.449
You're different.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.086
You want another drink?

36:22.680 --> 36:23.795
You workin' till close?

36:27.390 --> 36:28.800
Annette can close.

36:35.230 --> 36:36.390
Say somethin'.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.937
I've been sayin' somethin'.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.351
And I told you, I just need time.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.156
Yeah. Tick, tick, tick.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.730
If you were married,
you would understand.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.866
You know how many men
have said that to me?

36:51.160 --> 36:52.491
I'm not like them.

36:52.580 --> 36:54.411
Yeah, they said that, too.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.535
Anita.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.621
- I love you.
- Then prove it.

36:59.710 --> 37:01.371
Go to a pay phone, call your wife.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.789
Tell her it's over.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.384
Tell her you're with Anita Solano now
and you ain't comin' back.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.342
You're not gonna
do jack shit for me, are you?

37:11.430 --> 37:13.182
You're just a waste of my time.

37:13.270 --> 37:14.305
Hey, come on.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.015
Get your fucking hand off me.

37:16.110 --> 37:17.509
Come on, we can work this out.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.601
The hell with that,
and the hell with you.

37:19.690 --> 37:22.022
Let me go,
or I'll call your wife myself.

37:22.110 --> 37:23.316
And don't think I won't.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.448
Okay, hey. Stop. All right?

37:25.530 --> 37:26.610
Just stop!

37:28.370 --> 37:30.907
- God damn it!
- Fucking hate you!

37:31.000 --> 37:31.989
Ow! Shut up!

37:32.080 --> 37:34.412
Fuck you, you ugly cocksucker!

37:44.090 --> 37:46.046
Yeah, me, too. Been a while.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.926
Well...

38:00.650 --> 38:02.481
You wanna let me do this?

38:14.210 --> 38:17.327
Central to Midtown South, Portable .9.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.411
- What do we got?
- Female floater.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.583
Would have gone out with the current,
but she got hung up on the pilings.

38:22.670 --> 38:25.002
Respond to 240 West 4-3.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.710
10-4, ’kay.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.540
Zone squad to Central.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.050
Squad go.

38:31.140 --> 38:34.223
Central, notify Crime Scene
and the ME.

38:34.310 --> 38:37.347
Have 'em respond to 35th and 12th.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.305
Advise on ETA.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.970
10-4.

39:08.180 --> 39:11.138
- I didn't hear you come in.
- I didn't want to wake you.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.841
Hey, I wanted to talk to you.

39:15.930 --> 39:17.136
About what?

39:18.140 --> 39:20.973
Well, I needed to wrap my head
around some things, so I took off.

39:21.810 --> 39:23.311
I was wondering where you went.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.640
Mmm.

39:26.490 --> 39:27.775
I found it, Abby.

39:28.950 --> 39:29.939
What?

39:30.950 --> 39:32.690
This place.

39:32.780 --> 39:34.941
It's this town up in Vermont.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.861
It's not too big, it's not too small.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.702
Good people, it's a college town.

39:41.710 --> 39:44.338
Good houses, there's some
good opportunities there.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.750
- Vermont?
- Yeah.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.086
Vince, I'm from Connecticut, remember?

39:52.140 --> 39:53.505
And I've seen Vermont.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.092
Christ. I've seen them all.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.186
Where'd you stay last night?

40:04.270 --> 40:06.101
With a friend.

40:06.190 --> 40:07.771
Which friend?

40:11.450 --> 40:13.361
Dave Hiller.

40:13.450 --> 40:15.020
Ashley's partner.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.400
Dorothy.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.241
Dorothy. Whatever.

40:21.370 --> 40:23.782
You should be careful around that guy.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.120
Why is that?

40:26.170 --> 40:27.580
'Cause the pimps hate him.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.337
That means he's doing his job.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.716
The word is that Ash...

40:33.800 --> 40:35.848
Dorothy got another girl out of town.

40:35.930 --> 40:37.761
Chocolate, right?

40:37.850 --> 40:39.306
No, another one.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.516
Are you a little jealous here, Vince?

40:42.600 --> 40:44.227
We don't do jealous.

40:44.310 --> 40:47.143
You two wanna bang
each other's brains out, go for it.

40:47.230 --> 40:49.562
Have at it. But when you're with him,

40:49.650 --> 40:51.356
grow some eyes
in the back of your head.

41:02.410 --> 41:03.991
If it's any comfort,

41:05.330 --> 41:07.082
I get jealous, too.

41:09.130 --> 41:12.543
Hey, M.E. might take a minute.
Find us some good coffee.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.756
Midtown South Portable 5, go.

41:46.080 --> 41:50.790
- You catchin', Chris? Any ID?
- Nothin'.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.461
So what kind of an offer?

41:54.470 --> 41:57.382
You know who Marty Hodas is?
King of the Peeps?

41:57.470 --> 41:58.505
Uh-uh.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.636
Well, he has some backers
who are interested

42:00.720 --> 42:03.132
in some more feature-length stuff.

42:03.230 --> 42:06.097
Three films, one main character.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.010
They want you.

42:09.060 --> 42:12.279
- Three films.
- Six-month exclusive contract.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.648
No other film work.
No other work of any kind.

42:16.780 --> 42:18.065
This is it, kid.

42:19.990 --> 42:21.571
Sounds like we should do it, then.

42:21.660 --> 42:23.366
You sure?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.661
Yeah, I mean,
I'd have to clear it with CO,

42:26.750 --> 42:28.320
- but sounds good.
- Yeah.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.956
We need to talk about that.

42:30.040 --> 42:34.659
But first I need to know
that you're ready for this.

42:36.340 --> 42:39.047
'Cause they want to make you an offer,

42:39.140 --> 42:41.882
and I want to go to the table
and negotiate.

42:42.970 --> 42:45.302
I'm ready. Yeah.

42:45.390 --> 42:47.597
So these are some of the sets.

42:47.690 --> 42:50.306
- Fake walls.
- Excellent.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.469
Yeah.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.565
Looks so big.

42:55.860 --> 42:58.101
When we're shooting,
it feels a lot smaller.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.613
There's, you know,
eight, 10 people on the crew.

43:02.950 --> 43:07.205
There's... There's the guy
who's in charge of the lighting,

43:07.290 --> 43:09.246
and there's a guy who records sound.

43:09.330 --> 43:11.628
- And they all work for you?
- Uh...

43:12.290 --> 43:14.042
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

43:15.130 --> 43:17.212
When do you make a new movie?

43:17.300 --> 43:18.927
A new one?

43:19.010 --> 43:20.420
Still workin' on this one.

43:20.510 --> 43:24.514
- Can I watch you?
- No. Not this one.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.800
It's...

43:32.690 --> 43:34.351
Well, we're just cutting it now.

43:37.530 --> 43:39.851
I don't think you'd find it
very interesting.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.559
But you do know the story, though.

43:42.660 --> 43:43.649
What is it?

43:45.330 --> 43:46.900
It's "Little Red Riding Hood."

43:51.080 --> 43:52.536
You think it's dumb.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.747
I just wanna see you work.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.159
Tell my friends what you do.

44:00.630 --> 44:02.336
Maybe the next one.

44:02.430 --> 44:03.920
You're no fun.

44:06.390 --> 44:07.766
Let me show you the camera.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.600
You don't look so hot.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.031
Rizzi said you banged out sick.

44:42.260 --> 44:43.921
She had your watch.

44:46.510 --> 44:47.499
What?

44:47.600 --> 44:50.262
The one Linda gave you
for your anniversary.

44:54.770 --> 44:58.319
Watch was still tangled in her hand
when we pulled her out of the water.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.101
- Where is it now?
- McDonagh has it.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.030
Chris.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.917
Hand to God, it was an accident.

45:18.090 --> 45:20.911
We were arguing in the car,
she was clawing at me, I...

45:21.010 --> 45:22.625
I shoved her.

45:23.760 --> 45:25.580
I was just trying to get her to stop.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.880
Thing is, Danny,

45:29.720 --> 45:32.553
the most important thing is,
what are you gonna do now?

45:32.640 --> 45:35.689
I would never hurt her intentionally.

45:35.770 --> 45:38.147
You know me.
You know how I felt about her.

45:38.230 --> 45:41.688
Best option, call your union delegate
and turn yourself in.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.021
No. I can't do that.

45:44.110 --> 45:46.158
Better than they have
to come looking for you.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.026
Better than I have to take you in.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.111
You? You're my partner.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.491
That's why you should listen to me.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.837
Do the right thing.

45:58.920 --> 45:59.909
Okay.

46:02.550 --> 46:04.165
Just let me go home.

46:07.720 --> 46:11.133
Talk to my wife first.
I have to do that.

46:12.980 --> 46:15.517
- I'll drive you there.
- No.

46:17.150 --> 46:19.516
Chris, I'm not gonna rabbit.

46:20.650 --> 46:22.356
I got nowhere to go.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.981
Hey there, sugar bloom.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.479
Where you goin'?

46:32.830 --> 46:33.899
Bitch.

46:39.670 --> 46:40.955
Hot Rod

46:47.090 --> 46:48.887
Been lookin' for you everywhere.

46:48.970 --> 46:51.040
Gave up lookin' for you.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.472
I heard that Chocolate left.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.221
Then you heard wrong.

46:56.310 --> 46:59.302
I sold her to some player
out in Brooklyn.

46:59.400 --> 47:03.029
Shit. I'd have off-loaded her
for free.

47:03.110 --> 47:06.523
Bitch bumped her gums so much,
damn near drove me crazy.

47:12.450 --> 47:14.031
And you moved out of your crib?

47:16.080 --> 47:17.069
Got a better one.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.029
You holdin'?

47:22.540 --> 47:23.666
Yeah, baby.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.290
You know I got you.

48:46.210 --> 48:47.245
Fuckit

48:54.930 --> 48:56.340
Hello? Sanger Center,
how can I...

48:56.430 --> 48:57.499
Dona.

48:58.890 --> 49:00.846
Yes, by appointment only.

49:00.930 --> 49:03.148
What day were you interested in?

49:03.230 --> 49:05.437
Can I just put you on hold
for a minute?

49:05.520 --> 49:07.067
Thank you.

49:07.150 --> 49:08.856
Sanger Center, how can I help you?

49:09.990 --> 49:12.641
Sure. Clinic hours are
Monday through Friday,

49:12.740 --> 49:14.401
9:00 to 4:00.

49:14.490 --> 49:15.559
You're welcome.

49:17.080 --> 49:18.980
Okay, sorry about that.

49:19.080 --> 49:22.117
Let's see, you said Wednesday?

49:22.210 --> 49:24.110
Maybe he was cleaning his gun.

49:24.210 --> 49:25.746
Middle of the night, in his car,

49:25.830 --> 49:27.582
after writing out a note to his wife?

49:30.300 --> 49:33.178
I know. But it can't play.

49:34.890 --> 49:37.006
And then there's Anita Solano.

49:45.730 --> 49:47.937
Drunk. Fell on the rocks,
cracked her head open,

49:48.020 --> 49:49.009
went into the river.

49:56.370 --> 49:57.610
No pension there, either.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.786
- Do you want another one?
- Sure. What's it called?

50:08.880 --> 50:10.836
Village Queen. It's pineapple juice
and grenadine.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.127
Which is my favorite way to drink it.

50:13.220 --> 50:14.209
Hey, Kenneth.

50:14.300 --> 50:15.870
Can we talk? Alone?

50:15.970 --> 50:17.380
Of course. Yeah.

50:33.530 --> 50:34.940
This isn't gonna work out, is it?

50:39.870 --> 50:41.690
We got so busy with this place.

50:41.790 --> 50:43.189
That we forgot to break up.

50:45.830 --> 50:48.412
I love you. Shit.

50:50.630 --> 50:51.699
I love you, too.

50:53.460 --> 50:55.872
But now this is real,

50:55.970 --> 50:59.383
and so is the bar, and you're
gonna be livin' those hours.

50:59.470 --> 51:01.756
And me? That's not my life.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.470
What about the club?

51:07.060 --> 51:08.516
You gambled every dime you had on it.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.182
Do you want to stay partners?
Do you want out?

51:11.270 --> 51:13.898
- It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?
- It is.

51:15.490 --> 51:16.980
It's yours as much as mine.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.366
I think I want out.

51:27.460 --> 51:30.122
I swear, C.C., this is the nicest
place I've ever been to.

51:30.630 --> 51:32.746
You know what? That shit
kills your appetite.

51:34.590 --> 51:36.330
It was just a little bump.

51:36.420 --> 51:38.081
And I'm just lookin' out for you.

51:38.180 --> 51:40.671
You are. Thank you, baby.

51:43.310 --> 51:47.098
You know, I was told this place
has the best beef in the city.

51:47.180 --> 51:49.899
Hand-carved and aged to perfection.

51:50.980 --> 51:51.969
Here we go.

52:05.740 --> 52:08.243
Make it an honest pour.
And don't forget my girl.

52:08.330 --> 52:09.570
Of course, sir.

52:09.660 --> 52:11.287
We have a few specials tonight...

52:11.370 --> 52:12.917
We're gonna start
with two shrimp cocktails,

52:13.000 --> 52:14.376
then we're gonna have
two porterhouses.

52:14.460 --> 52:15.495
Just so you know,

52:15.590 --> 52:17.455
one porterhouse order
is for two people.

52:19.380 --> 52:21.757
Well, we want two.

52:22.550 --> 52:23.847
And how would you like that cooked?

52:23.930 --> 52:25.670
Well done, near to black.

52:25.760 --> 52:28.342
I see any kind of pink,
it's going right back.

52:28.430 --> 52:29.977
There be any sides this evening?

52:30.060 --> 52:31.687
Baby, I'm gonna let you choose.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.646
Um...

52:36.690 --> 52:39.944
- Baked potato?
- What the lady said.

52:40.030 --> 52:42.442
Excellent choice. Thank you.

52:42.530 --> 52:45.158
Tonight is all about you.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.906
Nobody but me knows how hard you work.

52:49.910 --> 52:53.073
However, I wanna say something.

52:54.790 --> 52:56.872
You're gonna be getting
a lot of opportunities now.

52:58.210 --> 53:00.792
Travel, celebrity status,
the whole nine.

53:00.880 --> 53:04.998
But wherever you go,
you should value the worth

53:05.100 --> 53:08.137
of what you have right here
in this city, with me.

53:09.600 --> 53:10.760
I do, Daddy.

53:10.850 --> 53:13.307
Ain't nobody gonna love you
the way I love you, Lori.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.765
You can believe that.

53:16.690 --> 53:17.816
Mmm.

54:02.070 --> 54:05.062
- You can tell me.
- I can't.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.980
- Why not?
- Yeah, how'd that go?

54:09.530 --> 54:11.998
You don't have to be shy with me.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.366
Come on. I've got a room
just around the corner.

54:17.210 --> 54:19.166
So what do you want to do?
You wanna pay for a room,

54:19.250 --> 54:20.877
want me to show you where to park?

54:20.960 --> 54:22.951
I only got time for a car date.

54:23.050 --> 54:25.371
Shay. Shay!

54:50.030 --> 54:51.941
Hey, Mr. Pipilo.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.826
- How you doin', Michael?
- All right.

54:53.910 --> 54:55.616
You guys licensed for this shit?

54:55.710 --> 54:57.530
- What's up?
- Come on.

54:57.620 --> 54:59.201
I got a surprise for you.

54:59.290 --> 55:01.087
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

55:01.170 --> 55:02.956
Get some lumpy Irish guy to do this.

55:03.050 --> 55:04.039
You're gonna hurt yourself.

55:04.130 --> 55:05.210
Let's go.

55:18.850 --> 55:21.057
- You like it?
- The car?

55:21.150 --> 55:22.560
No. Fire hydrant.

55:24.230 --> 55:25.686
Rudy, you didn't have to do this.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.099
Come on. Let's go get some dinner.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.315
I gotta open the club.

55:29.410 --> 55:30.900
I'll have you back before that.

55:30.990 --> 55:32.901
Come on. See how she drives.

55:32.990 --> 55:35.447
- Come on.
- All right.

55:35.540 --> 55:36.746
Get in there.

56:10.030 --> 56:12.157
- What's this?
- I know, right?

56:13.160 --> 56:14.616
It's like someone
took the mOV|e pr0jector

56:14.700 --> 56:16.156
and threw it in reverse.

56:17.200 --> 56:18.531
Go on. Take it.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.377
- For what?
- For your loss.

56:25.300 --> 56:26.949
I thought that was an accident.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.165
It was.

56:29.170 --> 56:31.172
Just forget she was seein' Danny.

56:31.260 --> 56:32.420
All right?

56:32.510 --> 56:33.795
For his family's sake.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.826
You ever have the segreto sauce
in this place?

57:02.210 --> 57:03.575
Get down! Get down!

57:06.210 --> 57:07.916
God damn it!

57:08.000 --> 57:09.251
Son of a bitch!

57:11.550 --> 57:12.960
Cocksucker!

57:13.050 --> 57:15.041
Who the fuck do they think we are?

57:15.140 --> 57:16.459
Jesus Christ!

57:17.640 --> 57:19.710
They were throwing
those shots at you, Vince!

57:19.810 --> 57:21.380
Who'd you piss off?
