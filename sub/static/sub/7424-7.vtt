Nine years ago,
<i>I witnessed my mother's murder.</i>

00:04.341 --> 00:08.309
I would have been killed, too,
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:09.561 --> 00:11.229
You're him.

00:11.231 --> 00:14.632
I just found...
six cases of you

00:14.634 --> 00:17.568
<i>trying to save victims</i>
<i>around the city.</i>

00:17.570 --> 00:21.022
<i>You're not a monster.</i>

Who are you making yourself
look so pretty for?

00:22.525 --> 00:23.658

00:23.660 --> 00:25.059
Well, that'd be nice.

00:25.061 --> 00:26.945
Surprise!

00:31.284 --> 00:32.650
to complicate things,
you know?

00:32.652 --> 00:34.285
We're friends. We work together.

00:34.287 --> 00:35.653
It's just one kiss.

00:35.655 --> 00:36.988
Right.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.456
Vincent, I want to have you
over for dinner.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.508
I'll have dinner ready by 8:00.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.378
<i>Unless there's something else</i>
<i>holding you back.</i>

00:43.380 --> 00:46.297
<i>I hope to see you there.</i>

00:46.299 --> 00:49.600
<i>I can't remember</i>
<i>what happened last night.</i>

00:49.602 --> 00:52.053
You fugued out.
Fugued out?

00:52.055 --> 00:55.023
You're up and walking around,

I seriously doubt I look giddy.

Frat party,
couple sneaks out

03:21.254 --> 03:22.319
to make nasty in the bushes,

03:22.321 --> 03:23.421
finds a cut-up

03:23.423 --> 03:24.422
How long's he been here?

03:24.424 --> 03:25.590

you didn't seriously just use
that as a segue, did you?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.766
Two tickets to the party.

03:35.768 --> 03:37.768
Sorry, but I have

03:37.770 --> 03:39.887
plans already.

03:39.889 --> 03:42.306
Yeah, you know what? You
actually do have plans, and

03:42.308 --> 03:44.192
they're called Mr. July
and Mr. October.

03:44.194 --> 03:46.510
Give me one good reason
besides your old favorite

03:46.512 --> 03:47.678
"I have to run an errand."

03:47.680 --> 03:49.030
Or do you want me
to start asking

03:49.032 --> 03:51.449
the tough questions about your
elusive life these days?

03:51.451 --> 03:53.618
It's just a casual thing, right?

03:53.620 --> 03:54.535
I'll be back

03:54.537 --> 03:56.070
before nightfall.
Hopefully

03:56.072 --> 03:56.988
not alone.

03:56.990 --> 03:58.372
All right.

it used to be.

04:06.132 --> 04:08.049
Vic is Derek Moore.
Narrowed down the time

04:08.051 --> 04:09.634
of death between midnight
and 1:00 a.m.

04:09.636 --> 04:11.586
I found a short trail of blood
on the sidewalk

04:11.588 --> 04:13.337
that veers up
into the lawn.

04:13.339 --> 04:16.390
He managed to make it this far
after the attack before he died?

04:16.392 --> 04:19.392
Yeah, but thanks to the
extremely efficient sprinkler system,

04:19.394 --> 04:22.396
the true crime scene's gonna be
next to impossible to find.

04:22.398 --> 04:24.565
Blood trail's been washed away.

04:53.845 --> 04:56.430
I blacked out again.

04:57.566 --> 04:59.717
Frontal cortex

04:59.719 --> 05:02.937
has maintained a steady
algorithm over the last hour.

05:02.939 --> 05:05.389
No sign of hypotension.

05:05.391 --> 05:07.091
I don't get it.

05:07.093 --> 05:08.943
You know, it's like
I'm sleepwalking or something.

05:08.945 --> 05:11.195
And I know it's not due
to low blood sugar,

05:11.197 --> 05:12.697
so what is triggering it?

05:12.699 --> 05:14.448
The trigger's unclear.

05:14.450 --> 05:16.734
Everything seems
normal-ish, but...

05:16.736 --> 05:19.436
you're showing signs
of dissociative amnesia.

05:19.438 --> 05:21.405
You don't remember
what you're doing,

05:21.407 --> 05:22.690
and...

05:22.692 --> 05:24.659
you're clearly doing something.

05:24.661 --> 05:28.112
Okay, I don't think
you should be around me.

05:28.114 --> 05:29.830
If I don't know
what I'm doing,

05:29.832 --> 05:31.048
and then I...
You're not

05:31.050 --> 05:32.250
gonna hurt me.

05:32.252 --> 05:33.251
But just in case,

05:33.253 --> 05:35.419
I have backup.

05:40.425 --> 05:41.726
Stings a little
but it's the best

05:41.728 --> 05:43.394
night's sleep you'll ever have.

05:44.229 --> 05:45.462
Good.

05:47.149 --> 05:50.818
But you're not the only one
I'm worried about.

05:52.604 --> 05:53.938
I think it's safe to say

05:53.940 --> 05:55.406
you'll need
an indefinite rain check

05:55.408 --> 05:57.074
on your camping weekend, but...

05:57.076 --> 05:58.809
we can't tell Catherine.
I can't

05:58.811 --> 06:00.161
keep another secret from her.

06:00.163 --> 06:02.480
Just until we know
what we're dealing with.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.198
If you think things are good,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.751
I seriously suggest you actually
listen to me this time.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.869
I know you don't want
to believe this, but...

06:08.871 --> 06:11.255
if Catherine thinks you're too
dangerous, too out of control,

06:11.257 --> 06:14.008
she's gonna reach a point
where she has to turn you in.

06:14.010 --> 06:15.509
I know she wouldn't
do that, okay?

06:15.511 --> 06:16.794
We have to tell her.
Okay.

06:16.796 --> 06:18.045
Let's not forget that we have

06:18.047 --> 06:19.830
a much bigger problem
on our hands.

06:19.832 --> 06:21.432
If that wasn't your blood,

06:21.434 --> 06:22.833
whose was it?

06:24.886 --> 06:27.571
I don't know.

06:27.573 --> 06:30.024
All I remember is that
I was walking past

06:30.026 --> 06:32.676
Northam Campus on my way
to Catherine's, okay?

06:32.678 --> 06:35.613
It must have been
just after midnight.

06:35.615 --> 06:37.031
And all of a sudden,

06:37.033 --> 06:38.699
you know, I started
to feel light-headed

06:38.701 --> 06:41.068
and then... and then
I don't remember.

06:42.955 --> 06:44.221
It's happening.

06:45.907 --> 06:47.658
Do you feel any, uh...

06:49.995 --> 06:51.996
Vincent?

07:20.158 --> 07:20.908
Vincent,

07:20.910 --> 07:21.725

It's the middle of the day.

08:43.578 --> 08:45.495
Probably on a rooftop somewhere.

08:45.497 --> 08:47.747

You know Vincent.

08:47.749 --> 08:50.249

Uh, you know what?

08:51.452 --> 08:53.369

08:53.371 --> 08:54.804
Could you just let him

08:54.806 --> 08:56.305
roped into something
by my partner tonight,

08:56.307 --> 08:58.123
so I'm gonna have to push

08:58.125 --> 09:00.259
Hope that's okay.
Yeah. N-Northam?

09:00.261 --> 09:02.678

09:02.680 --> 09:04.680

09:04.682 --> 09:06.298

Pretty gruesome.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.483

09:09.854 --> 09:13.472

colleagues there.

09:13.474 --> 09:15.408

09:17.695 --> 09:20.947
No. Pretty slow, actually.

09:30.592 --> 09:32.208

09:32.210 --> 09:35.428
Always wonder when

09:37.135 --> 09:38.617
Uh, anyway, uh...

09:38.618 --> 09:40.034

09:41.421 --> 09:43.187
Good seeing you.

09:45.758 --> 09:47.792
Okay.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.392
Any luck tracking down

10:04.394 --> 10:06.194
No enemies have
surfaced yet,

10:06.196 --> 10:08.479
but I'm about to have some
face time with his girlfriend.

10:08.481 --> 10:10.898
She didn't do it.
She has an alibi--

10:10.900 --> 10:12.900
study group, Chem 102.
Don't remind me.

10:12.902 --> 10:14.869
That's when I decided
to become a lawyer.

10:14.871 --> 10:17.238
Oh, yeah? How's that
working out for you?

10:17.240 --> 10:19.624
The 401(k) plan and fancy
expense account are great,

10:19.626 --> 10:21.626
and it's awesome spending
weekends on my yacht,

10:21.628 --> 10:23.461
thanks for asking.
Lab results should be in.

10:23.463 --> 10:24.712
I'm gonna head
to the morgue.

10:24.714 --> 10:26.581

something

10:41.064 --> 10:42.146

10:42.148 --> 10:44.148
Peter, you know
what would be

10:44.150 --> 10:46.017
really helpful? If you could
go and get the report

10:46.019 --> 10:47.518
from the first investigators
on the scene

10:47.520 --> 10:48.653
and see if it mentions anything

10:48.655 --> 10:49.854
about the postmortem stain.

10:49.856 --> 10:51.322
They put that in the report?

10:51.324 --> 10:52.723
That is so cool.

10:52.725 --> 10:55.243
Feel free to take your time.

10:56.278 --> 10:58.062
Oh, my God,
you have a fan boy.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.282
Cause of death:

11:01.284 --> 11:03.000
excessive bleeding
from multiple lacerations.

11:05.788 --> 11:08.122
Now, we're going to run
his clothes to see if we find

11:08.124 --> 11:09.874
any DNA other than Derek's.

11:09.876 --> 11:12.710
And we found splinters embedded
deeply in the palm of his hand.

11:12.712 --> 11:14.295
Maybe he was defending himself
with something.

11:14.297 --> 11:15.746
You were so right.

11:15.748 --> 11:18.216
Postmortem stain.
You really pegged it.

11:18.218 --> 11:19.183
Rad.

11:19.185 --> 11:21.302
Totally rad.

11:21.304 --> 11:23.354
So, Catherine, this is what I
thought you'd find interesting.

11:23.356 --> 11:25.773
At first, I was inclined
to write it off as a cut.

11:25.775 --> 11:28.192
Maybe he snagged his ankle
on a rock or something, but...

11:28.194 --> 11:29.560
Looks like a check mark.

11:29.562 --> 11:31.696
It is, and I've seen
one like it before.

11:31.698 --> 11:33.264
Carved into
another body?

11:33.266 --> 11:34.949
I haven't been able
to remember where,

11:34.951 --> 11:37.285
but I've started
to pull old files.

11:37.287 --> 11:38.736
He was in a fraternity.

11:38.738 --> 11:41.289
Maybe it was
an initiation. Hazing.

11:48.347 --> 11:50.348
Look, I don't know
what else to tell you.

11:50.350 --> 11:52.250
Maybe a hazing ritual
went wrong.

11:52.252 --> 11:53.768
Wouldn't be the first time.

11:53.770 --> 11:55.686
You want to tell us
about initiation?

11:55.688 --> 11:57.889
We don't really make
that kind of thing public.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.290
We all take an oath here.

11:59.292 --> 12:00.475
Okay.

12:00.477 --> 12:02.577
You have any enemies?

12:02.579 --> 12:05.062
Maybe a rival house?

12:05.064 --> 12:06.848
Derek was a leader,
a pledge master.

12:06.850 --> 12:09.133
The guys here--
they all looked up to him.

12:09.135 --> 12:11.102
He was one of my best bros.

12:11.104 --> 12:13.804
You seem pretty mellow for a guy
whose best bro just got killed.

12:13.806 --> 12:16.407
I smoked a bowl this morning.

12:16.409 --> 12:18.910
You want to arrest me, go ahead.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.612
My dad's a partner
at Lange and Wallace.

12:21.614 --> 12:24.749
Oh, partner. Must
be a nice yacht.

12:24.751 --> 12:26.784
I'm late for class.

12:32.958 --> 12:34.792
Excuse me.

12:34.794 --> 12:36.544
Hey.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.763
Any reason
you're playing I Spy?

12:38.765 --> 12:42.666
We could use some help
catching whoever did this.

12:42.668 --> 12:45.436
He was your brother. That's
got to matter to somebody.

12:45.438 --> 12:48.606
It does, but I'm new here,
and I took an oath...

12:48.608 --> 12:50.141
Okay, enough
with the frickin' oath.

12:50.143 --> 12:52.009
We're not asking you
for your secret handshake.

12:52.011 --> 12:53.778
But if you could
point us to somebody

12:53.780 --> 12:56.347
who might have had a bone
to pick with Derek.

12:59.868 --> 13:01.685
Want to explain?

13:01.687 --> 13:03.070
It's all the pledges.

13:03.072 --> 13:05.523
When we accept a bid,
we sign our names.

13:05.525 --> 13:06.908
It's tradition.

13:06.910 --> 13:09.193
And the names that get crossed out?
Dropouts.

13:09.195 --> 13:10.828
Why would someone drop?

13:10.830 --> 13:13.998
They can't hack it,
but I'd rather go through

13:14.000 --> 13:15.967
with initiation than deal
with the fallout of bailing.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.534
Fallout as in...?

13:17.536 --> 13:19.053
Let's just say,

13:19.055 --> 13:20.638
I wouldn't be checking
my Facebook page much

13:20.640 --> 13:22.006
if I chickened out.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.391
It can get
kind of brutal.

13:23.393 --> 13:24.842
Oh, public disgrace
and humiliation.

13:24.844 --> 13:26.477
Joys of male bonding.

13:27.646 --> 13:28.896
Any idea where Bradley is?

13:28.898 --> 13:30.648
No one's seen him around campus

13:30.650 --> 13:34.135
since he left the house.

13:38.324 --> 13:40.942
You don't need it.

13:40.944 --> 13:43.060
Tell that to my vertebrae

13:43.062 --> 13:45.112
and the concrete wall
that realigned them.

13:45.114 --> 13:47.564
I didn't?

13:47.566 --> 13:49.333
You did.

13:49.335 --> 13:51.869
You didn't know what you were
doing, so no guilt, but,

13:51.871 --> 13:53.237
I mean, toss me across the room

13:53.239 --> 13:55.039
like a sack of flour once,
shame on you.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.758
I am so sorry. Are you okay?
I'll live.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.093
But these new
Terminator episodes

13:59.095 --> 14:02.179
take things
to a whole new level.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.103
Okay, I cannot leave
this building

14:09.105 --> 14:11.606
until we figure out
how to control it.

14:13.192 --> 14:14.692
What did you find?

14:14.694 --> 14:16.894
It's not pretty.

14:18.063 --> 14:20.314
So, basically,

14:20.316 --> 14:23.484
when you're in Terminator
trance, it looks like

14:23.486 --> 14:25.602
your frontal lobe is repressed.

14:25.604 --> 14:27.204
Like the functions

14:27.206 --> 14:29.440
that would normally
give you control over

14:29.442 --> 14:34.278
your emotions, compassion,
and all the...

14:34.280 --> 14:35.779
touchy-feely stuff.

14:35.781 --> 14:38.282
Okay, what else?

14:38.284 --> 14:40.751
What?

14:40.753 --> 14:42.253
JT, what is it?

14:42.255 --> 14:46.340
Uh...

14:46.342 --> 14:49.577
you have anything
against frat guys?

14:49.579 --> 14:51.679
No. Why?

14:51.681 --> 14:53.230
Catherine's
investigating a murder

14:53.232 --> 14:55.750
that happened
right when you were blacked out.

14:55.752 --> 14:58.519
Same part of
town, same hour.

14:58.521 --> 15:02.189
Died of multiple lacerations.

15:02.191 --> 15:05.076
Kind of like... claws.

15:18.030 --> 15:21.349

Hey. March,

15:38.978 --> 15:39.748
right?

15:39.749 --> 15:40.948
Yes, ma'am, that's right.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.399
Big fan of your work.

15:42.401 --> 15:43.834
She means your charity work.

15:43.836 --> 15:45.169
It's a great cause.

15:45.171 --> 15:47.004
Abs aren't bad, either.
Tess.

15:47.006 --> 15:49.673
What? We're female cops. We
get objectified all the time.

15:49.675 --> 15:51.592
Besides, you don't
mind, do you?

15:53.094 --> 15:54.461
Okay. I'm gonna...

15:54.463 --> 15:56.413
I'm gonna go
check out the buffet.

15:56.415 --> 15:57.798
See ya.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.435
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

16:04.357 --> 16:07.141
<i>February?</i>

16:07.143 --> 16:09.193
Really? Who doesn't
love February?

16:09.195 --> 16:11.762
It's so... cozy.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.197
So, July.

16:13.199 --> 16:14.481
July's a great month.

16:14.483 --> 16:16.116
<i>November</i> is <i>great.</i>

16:16.118 --> 16:19.620
It's got Thanksgiving
and everything.

16:25.377 --> 16:27.161
Hey.

16:27.163 --> 16:29.546
Hi.
Mike.

16:29.548 --> 16:31.215
Mike Strickland.

16:31.217 --> 16:33.500
I'm September.
Thanks.

16:33.502 --> 16:36.170
How do they decide the months,
anyway?

16:36.172 --> 16:37.805
Do they look at you and go,

16:37.807 --> 16:39.556
"You look like fall,
but not like late fall?"

16:39.558 --> 16:42.176
Weren't you on the beat
in the 98th three years back?

16:42.178 --> 16:44.345
You were first on the scene
of that tour bus.

16:44.347 --> 16:46.680
Right. You saved that kid
with glasses who was trapped.

16:46.682 --> 16:49.400
Yeah, he's in the sixth grade
now. He still sends me letters.

16:49.402 --> 16:53.303
Oh, well, um... good memory.

16:53.305 --> 16:56.273
I'm gonna go and work the room,

16:56.275 --> 16:58.242
or whatever I'm supposed
to be doing.

16:58.244 --> 17:00.811
Okay. Good luck.

17:09.055 --> 17:10.454
I wasn't hiding
or anything, ma'am.

17:10.455 --> 17:12.289
I was at my parents.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.675
Ma'am? Ouch.

17:15.678 --> 17:18.494
You realize we don't like that
till we're, like, 50, right?

17:18.497 --> 17:22.715
Sorry. I don't really know how
to talk to, you know... cops.

17:22.718 --> 17:24.184
Lady cops.

17:24.185 --> 17:27.554
Can you tell us why
you dropped out of the Delts?

17:27.556 --> 17:30.190
You obviously pledged
for a reason.

17:30.192 --> 17:34.278
You were the only one to drop.
Couldn't handle the pressure?

17:34.280 --> 17:37.331
Look, Derek had this coming,

17:37.333 --> 17:39.366
but I didn't do it.

17:39.368 --> 17:40.901
I was playing
<i>Deathwatch PvP.</i>

17:40.903 --> 17:42.286
I'm sorry?

17:42.288 --> 17:43.637
It's, uh, player
versus player

17:43.639 --> 17:45.689
with graphical interface.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.491
You know, we had five guys
with picture lock on each other.

17:47.493 --> 17:50.127
What do you mean,
"Derek had it coming to him?"

17:51.629 --> 17:54.665
He's a complete sadist.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.801
I mean, I know
initiation is supposed to be

17:57.803 --> 18:00.754
about jackass,
old-school bonding stuff,

18:00.756 --> 18:04.274
but Derek would literally
beat me with a paddle.

18:04.276 --> 18:06.093
<i>You should have run</i>
<i>when you had a chance.</i>

18:06.095 --> 18:09.263
I'm gonna teach you
what it means to be a brother.

18:09.265 --> 18:10.714
You're gonna beg
for freaking mercy, bro.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.383
Like Walton Bell Tower
never saw.

18:13.385 --> 18:14.685
I am gonna make you weep.

18:14.687 --> 18:16.653
Who's Walton?

18:16.655 --> 18:18.054
It's a <i>what.</i>

18:18.056 --> 18:19.573
The Walton Bell Tower
on campus.

18:19.575 --> 18:22.159
It's where most of
the fun went down.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.065
Were all the hazing
rituals done there?

18:29.067 --> 18:30.400
Pretty much.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.252
Actual crime scene?

18:32.254 --> 18:34.237
Derek wasn't attacked
where he was found.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.622
Tech triangulated the call.

18:35.624 --> 18:37.124
Came from a quadrant of campus

18:37.126 --> 18:39.626
midway between the party
Derek left and that tower.

18:39.628 --> 18:41.745
Why would you leave a party
alone in the middle of the night

18:41.747 --> 18:43.096
and go halfway across campus?

18:43.098 --> 18:44.548
And head to a
hazing tower.

18:44.550 --> 18:47.017
He made it sound like
he was meeting you there.

18:47.019 --> 18:49.686
Up there? In the middle
of the night? No way.

18:49.688 --> 18:51.254
It sounded like
he thought he was.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.390
Maybe someone
used your name

18:53.392 --> 18:54.525
to lure him there?

18:54.527 --> 18:56.310
Maybe said you'd reconsidered.

18:56.312 --> 18:57.461
That you were coming back
to the house.

18:57.463 --> 19:00.197
And meeting him at Walton Tower.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.291
I rest my case.

19:11.293 --> 19:14.210
Still no closer to
understanding guys.

19:18.716 --> 19:21.418
Looks like we found
the actual scene of attack.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.670
Is that a saddle shoe?

19:23.672 --> 19:25.922
I didn't know those
came back into style.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.926
I'll call our location in.

19:40.855 --> 19:44.407
Vincent? Why are you here?

19:44.409 --> 19:46.976
I'm so sorry.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.578
I followed you.

19:48.580 --> 19:51.081
What are you doing?

19:51.083 --> 19:53.833
I thought we were going
to meet tonight.

19:54.869 --> 19:56.786
Uh, tonight can't happen.

19:56.788 --> 20:00.340
I'm sorry. I-I really
wanted to get away

20:00.342 --> 20:03.460
from all of this with you...

20:03.462 --> 20:05.879
but, uh, things have changed.

20:05.881 --> 20:07.881
Oh.

20:07.883 --> 20:09.933
No. I understand.

20:09.935 --> 20:11.851
No, I don't think you do.

20:13.387 --> 20:16.890
I need to tell you something.

20:16.892 --> 20:19.642
The killer
that you're after--

20:19.644 --> 20:21.444
he might be me.

20:31.462 --> 20:32.702
In a minute we'll know
if the blood

20:32.703 --> 20:34.670
from the tower matches
what Vincent tracked in.

20:37.124 --> 20:39.341
Hey?
Yeah?

20:41.461 --> 20:43.879
Hey, um, I'm so sorry
about this weekend.

20:43.881 --> 20:46.565
That doesn't
matter right now.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.934
You didn't ask for this.

20:48.936 --> 20:52.688
Vincent, you did
not murder Derek.

20:52.690 --> 20:56.809
Even when you're not yourself,
you do the right thing.

20:56.811 --> 20:59.278
I kill people, too,
and you know it.

21:00.864 --> 21:04.033
I wish that I could tell you

21:04.035 --> 21:06.368
that normally,
this wasn't my life, but...

21:06.370 --> 21:08.621
I'm not going anywhere.

21:09.990 --> 21:12.408
Trust me.

21:13.877 --> 21:15.244
Okay.

21:17.664 --> 21:20.216
Derek was on his way
across campus.

21:20.218 --> 21:22.951
We think that he was sent there
by someone at the party.

21:22.953 --> 21:24.119
One of his fraternity brothers?

21:24.121 --> 21:25.304
Or at least one
of the pledges.

21:25.306 --> 21:27.506
Derek was brutal during hazings.

21:27.508 --> 21:29.458
Tess is running
all their profiles.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.744
Good, because one of them
is your perp.

21:31.746 --> 21:33.646
Most likely.

21:33.648 --> 21:34.963
The blood samples
don't match.

21:34.965 --> 21:36.465
Vincent didn't do it.

21:38.068 --> 21:39.902
Okay,

21:39.904 --> 21:41.637
but I had someone's blood on me.

21:41.639 --> 21:43.105
Whose was it?

21:54.951 --> 21:56.485
What's that?

21:56.487 --> 21:58.954
I'm scanning through
old cases from last year.

21:58.956 --> 22:01.990
I know that I've seen
this strange check mark

22:01.992 --> 22:03.626
somewhere before.

22:03.628 --> 22:05.094
A-ha.

22:05.096 --> 22:07.046
Oh, my gosh, you were right.

22:07.048 --> 22:09.415
Another body found on campus
almost a year ago.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.300
Looks like we're
no longer talking

22:11.302 --> 22:12.518
about one isolated homicide.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.271
You got all that
from one check mark?

22:15.273 --> 22:17.556
Obviously the check mark
is a calling card

22:17.558 --> 22:21.894
the killer is leaving behind,
targeting college students.

22:21.896 --> 22:23.445
No. Hang on.

22:23.447 --> 22:25.998
She wasn't even
officially a victim.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.350
She was a cadaver
from the campus anatomy lab.

22:28.352 --> 22:30.436
"Campus security
found the cadaver

22:30.438 --> 22:32.955
"lying on the steps
of the old science block

22:32.957 --> 22:37.743
with a fresh check mark
carved into her embalmed flesh""

22:37.745 --> 22:40.629
They wrote it off
as a sick prank.

22:43.032 --> 22:45.134
That's amazing that
you remembered that photo.

22:45.136 --> 22:49.088
So the cadaver was
practice, perhaps.

22:49.090 --> 22:50.990
For a real murder?

22:50.992 --> 22:52.808
A year later.

22:52.810 --> 22:56.312
You never know what triggers
these guys to take the big step.

22:58.431 --> 23:02.017
I need you to double-check
the ETA on those lab results.

23:02.019 --> 23:03.552
Cool.

23:03.554 --> 23:04.904
Where are you going?

23:04.906 --> 23:06.655
Our killer had to have
access to the lab

23:06.657 --> 23:08.157
where the cadaver was from.

23:08.159 --> 23:10.359
I'm going to have them
pull the student roster

23:10.361 --> 23:11.994
for that semester,

23:11.996 --> 23:15.164
and then I'm gonna check out
the actual crime scene.

23:17.233 --> 23:19.568
Please tell me
you got something new.

23:19.570 --> 23:21.587
I'm at the bell tower.
Been too busy with the body

23:21.589 --> 23:24.239
to actually survey the true
crime scene that you found.

23:24.241 --> 23:26.058
Our killer left that check mark

23:26.060 --> 23:27.509
as a calling card,

23:27.511 --> 23:28.877
so there's probably other clues.

23:28.879 --> 23:30.763
What did you make of that ball?

23:30.765 --> 23:32.097
Seemed like some kind
of throwback ritual

23:32.099 --> 23:34.500
that was part of
initiation tradition.

23:34.502 --> 23:36.518
Brothers didn't give us much.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.437
Yeah, it's almost as if
the scene's been staged

23:38.439 --> 23:40.088
for some reason.

23:40.090 --> 23:42.441
Look, I had seen
that check mark before.

23:42.443 --> 23:44.143
I think our killer
made a practice run

23:44.145 --> 23:45.361
several months ago.

23:45.363 --> 23:46.395
Practice run?

23:46.397 --> 23:48.530
On a cadaver here on campus.

23:48.532 --> 23:51.650
I put a call in
to get a roster... Agh!

23:51.652 --> 23:52.601
Evan?

23:52.603 --> 23:53.902
Evan, are you okay?

23:53.904 --> 23:54.737
Evan!

23:54.739 --> 23:56.956
Evan! Evan!

24:01.020 --> 24:02.454
Whoever this SOB was,

24:02.751 --> 24:05.239
he was bold enough
to kidnap one of our own.

24:05.339 --> 24:06.755
We're in a race
against the clock.

24:06.757 --> 24:08.507
Found Evan's phone
in the bell tower.

24:08.509 --> 24:10.042
From what he told me,
we're looking for someone

24:10.044 --> 24:12.428
who was planning this murder
for a while now.

24:12.430 --> 24:14.263
We think this cadaver
was a trial run.

24:14.265 --> 24:15.664
IT got into Evan's computers.

24:15.666 --> 24:18.184
This picture was the last window
that was opened.

24:18.186 --> 24:20.769
Looks like our perp
did a test on a cadaver

24:20.771 --> 24:22.805
from the campus anatomy lab
several months ago.

24:22.807 --> 24:24.190
Think he took the plunge
and made his first real kill

24:24.192 --> 24:25.274
with this fraternity kid?

24:25.276 --> 24:26.559
That's what it looks like.

24:26.561 --> 24:28.093
I'm circulating
a list of students

24:28.095 --> 24:30.679
who had access
to the Northam Cadaver Lab

24:30.681 --> 24:32.648
the semester
of the first incident.

24:32.650 --> 24:34.349
Evan had requested it
before he was kidnapped.

24:34.351 --> 24:35.901
We pulled it
from his emails.

24:35.903 --> 24:37.286
If our perp sticks close
to campus, why take Evan?

24:37.288 --> 24:38.454
What's this psycho's MO?

24:38.456 --> 24:40.406
We don't have motive
for Derek's attack,

24:40.408 --> 24:42.524
but for Evan,
it seemed pretty simple.

24:42.526 --> 24:43.626
He was getting too close.

24:43.628 --> 24:45.394
Close to what?
The guy's stuck in a morgue.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.496
But he was taken from
the crime scene on campus.

24:47.498 --> 24:48.831
Wait a minute.

24:48.833 --> 24:50.416
What's the name of
Evan's new intern?

24:50.418 --> 24:52.635
Peter something,
the third.

24:52.637 --> 24:53.969
Hollingsworth?

24:53.971 --> 24:55.321
From Northam University.

24:55.323 --> 24:56.305
Son of a bitch.

24:56.307 --> 24:58.641
That's why he knew
Evan was onto him.

24:58.643 --> 24:59.592
You really think
he'd have the balls

24:59.594 --> 25:02.428
to come to a precinct,
into our own lab

25:02.430 --> 25:03.979
that's investigating
the murders he committed?

25:03.981 --> 25:05.481
What if the whole thing
was planned?

25:05.483 --> 25:06.649
What better way
for a criminology student

25:06.651 --> 25:07.733
to follow his first kill

25:07.735 --> 25:09.217
all the way through
the whole process?

25:09.219 --> 25:11.053
He asked for an internship
in the precinct

25:11.055 --> 25:12.855
where he knew
Derek's body would end up.

25:12.857 --> 25:13.906
Okay, okay, I'll put out an APB.

25:13.908 --> 25:16.325
We got our perp.
Let's get this SOB.

25:16.327 --> 25:18.494
We'll find out where he lives.

25:56.449 --> 25:58.951
What's is this?

26:01.237 --> 26:02.738
Oh, my God.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.957
Something tells me this
isn't for a dissertation.

26:08.378 --> 26:09.945
Wait a minute.

26:12.832 --> 26:18.470
Jazz album, saddle shoe,
beach ball.

26:18.472 --> 26:20.589
Derek's murder is
an exact replica,

26:20.591 --> 26:22.725
except for when he tried
to crawl away for help.

26:22.727 --> 26:24.426
Peter's copying famous
murders in the city.

26:24.428 --> 26:25.844
Great. A copycat.

26:25.846 --> 26:27.062
Nothing better
than one freak

26:27.064 --> 26:28.514
mimicking a bunch
of other freaks.

26:28.516 --> 26:30.015
I'm gonna send these
to the precinct,

26:30.017 --> 26:31.233
see if they can get
any information

26:31.235 --> 26:32.568
on the original cases

26:32.570 --> 26:33.969
that might help us figure out
where he took Evan.

26:33.971 --> 26:35.270
But if he was gonna
try to kill Evan,

26:35.272 --> 26:36.989
why not just do it
in the bell tower?

26:36.991 --> 26:39.775
These crimes are all about
precision and control, right?

26:39.777 --> 26:41.910
So if he's recreating
famous New York murders,

26:41.912 --> 26:44.363
he's not going to just
kill Evan randomly.

26:44.365 --> 26:46.615
Okay, so the question is:
which one of these

26:46.617 --> 26:47.916
is he going to recreate
with Evan?

26:47.918 --> 26:49.368
We can rule out the ones
he already committed.

26:49.370 --> 26:51.253
And the ones that are
too far away.

26:51.255 --> 26:52.705
It's broad daylight.

26:52.707 --> 26:53.839
He's going to want
to go somewhere dark,

26:53.841 --> 26:55.490
somewhere out of the way.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.801
The subway tracks.

27:08.221 --> 27:11.607
But the closest subway station's
over a mile from the bell tower.

27:11.609 --> 27:13.809
Manhattan Main Line.

27:13.811 --> 27:15.694
There is no
Manhattan Main Line.

27:15.696 --> 27:17.896
But there was back
in the '20s.

27:17.898 --> 27:20.348
It used to connect to
that old City Hall Line.

27:20.350 --> 27:22.201
Let's get everybody down there.
It's not going to be easy.

27:22.203 --> 27:24.352
That rail line--
it goes on for miles.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.624
<i>What about this one?</i>

27:28.626 --> 27:31.460
Attempted rape, assailant
hasn't come forward yet.

27:31.462 --> 27:33.829
No ID on the guy who saved her.

27:33.831 --> 27:35.330
Promising.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.250
You forgot to turn
on the security?

27:38.252 --> 27:39.334
What's the point?

27:39.336 --> 27:40.803
Vincent, I need you.

27:40.805 --> 27:42.171
Someone took Evan.

27:42.173 --> 27:44.372
The guy from her birthday?
Yes.

27:44.374 --> 27:45.424
The one you kissed?

27:45.426 --> 27:46.308
JT.

27:46.310 --> 27:48.093
Just clarifying.
He's gone.

27:48.095 --> 27:49.244
I need you to come with me.

27:49.246 --> 27:51.263
I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:51.265 --> 27:54.049
He may have been taken to
the tunnels under campus.

27:54.051 --> 27:55.984
The abandoned rail line.
Why there?

27:55.986 --> 28:00.656
He's... He's recreating
old killings.

28:00.658 --> 28:03.492
Vincent,
he's recreating yours,

28:03.494 --> 28:05.894
from the night
you saved me at the subway.

28:07.414 --> 28:09.164
You know the underbelly
of this city

28:09.166 --> 28:10.783
better than anyone.

28:10.785 --> 28:12.901
You might be my only
hope of finding Evan

28:12.903 --> 28:14.670
before it's too late.

28:17.907 --> 28:20.075
Why am I always outnumbered?

28:20.077 --> 28:22.127
Fine, if you're
going to go

28:22.129 --> 28:24.880
into the dark tunnels
with this guy alone...

28:29.053 --> 28:31.103
you're gonna need this.

28:40.864 --> 28:43.198
Check that tunnel down there.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.267
Over this way,
over this way.

28:51.007 --> 28:52.875
Apparently, your apprenticeship
is at an end.

28:52.877 --> 28:53.992
It's okay.

28:53.994 --> 28:57.112
I been studying
my whole life.

28:57.114 --> 28:58.764
Any particular reason?

28:58.766 --> 29:00.749
Happy little boys
don't conventionally dream

29:00.751 --> 29:02.050
of slicing up bodies.

29:02.052 --> 29:03.785
Do they usually find
their fathers

29:03.787 --> 29:05.921
lying stone-cold
on the garage floor

29:05.923 --> 29:07.306
with a perfect splatter of blood

29:07.308 --> 29:08.557
projecting from their
left temple?

29:18.551 --> 29:20.468
How old were you?

29:20.470 --> 29:21.570
Seven.

29:21.572 --> 29:24.139
Does it matter?

29:24.141 --> 29:26.608
Did that moment turn me
into something I wasn't,

29:26.610 --> 29:28.643
or have I always
been this way?

29:28.645 --> 29:29.995
Enough studying,
time for action?

29:33.950 --> 29:35.868
I can hear your sarcasm,

29:35.870 --> 29:39.288
but if you really wanted
to understand us,

29:39.290 --> 29:41.039
you should have tried harder.

29:41.041 --> 29:44.159
Doesn't it ever get to you,

29:44.161 --> 29:45.711
only being a spectator,

29:45.713 --> 29:49.264
never actually
accomplishing anything yourself?

29:49.266 --> 29:52.301
I can't say that
that perspective

29:52.303 --> 29:54.636
has ever presented itself to me.

29:55.471 --> 29:57.339
Why Derek?

29:57.341 --> 30:01.059
You picked him as your
first for a reason.

30:01.061 --> 30:03.779
I'd done my homework, and...

30:03.781 --> 30:04.980
it was time.

30:04.982 --> 30:06.064
I saw what Derek did

30:06.066 --> 30:09.034
to those pledges.

30:09.036 --> 30:10.869
It wasn't right.

30:10.871 --> 30:13.322
Plus he had the look

30:13.324 --> 30:15.924
that I needed, so...

30:15.926 --> 30:19.728
Still, it's hard to control
the variables, isn't it?

30:19.730 --> 30:21.380
With me,

30:21.382 --> 30:23.448
you didn't really have time
to prepare at all.

30:23.450 --> 30:26.034
Am I even the right type?

30:26.036 --> 30:28.387
To have this kill not align
with the first

30:28.389 --> 30:31.557
in its acute attention
to detail, well...

30:31.559 --> 30:33.508
That'll keep you up at night.

30:37.730 --> 30:42.100
You're trying to
get into my head.

30:42.102 --> 30:44.353
And it's working, I assume,

30:44.355 --> 30:48.991
because I'm right.

30:48.993 --> 30:50.192
Anything?

30:50.194 --> 30:51.443
Other than bad memories

30:51.445 --> 30:53.612
from the last time
we were down here? No.

30:53.614 --> 30:55.163
I'm alive because of you.

30:55.165 --> 30:56.898
And I would do it again.

30:56.900 --> 31:01.403
It just doesn't make taking
a life any easier, that's all.

31:05.842 --> 31:08.076
Oh, no.

31:08.078 --> 31:10.596
Catherine,

31:12.515 --> 31:14.266
I think it's happening.

31:16.419 --> 31:18.920
Take it.

31:18.922 --> 31:20.255
Please.

31:20.257 --> 31:21.690
Protect yourself.

31:21.692 --> 31:22.757
Take it.
You know what to do.

31:22.759 --> 31:24.092
No, I won't.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.317
Take it.

31:34.238 --> 31:35.437
Take it.

31:36.456 --> 31:38.523
Vincent.

32:16.413 --> 32:18.330
You're being
too impulsive.

32:18.332 --> 32:23.418
You need to slow down,
take your time.

33:49.372 --> 33:51.339
Evan.

33:51.341 --> 33:52.340
No, it's okay.

33:52.342 --> 33:53.375
It's me.

33:53.377 --> 33:54.960
Cat.

33:54.962 --> 33:56.511
Cat, what the hell
just happened?

33:58.798 --> 34:00.915
Thank God we got
to you in time.

34:00.917 --> 34:02.634
I was scared.

34:02.636 --> 34:04.519
Are you okay?

34:37.826 --> 34:40.081
I have been calling.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.533
He's here.

34:41.534 --> 34:43.168
Oh, thank God. Is he okay?

34:43.170 --> 34:44.668
Yeah.

34:44.670 --> 34:47.021
We've got it under control.

34:47.023 --> 34:48.255
Okay, I am on my way.

34:48.257 --> 34:49.757
No.

34:49.759 --> 34:52.177
I-I mean...

34:52.179 --> 34:54.762
I don't think
now is a good time.

34:54.764 --> 34:58.983
JT, I don't know
how we cover this one up.

35:00.069 --> 35:02.070
Evan heard the whole attack.

35:02.072 --> 35:03.438
Be normal.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.573
Be as normal
as you can possibly be.

35:05.575 --> 35:08.309
No one needs to know
you have anything to do with us.

35:08.311 --> 35:10.395
Don't give anyone a chance
to wonder what's going on.

35:12.865 --> 35:15.083
Okay.

35:30.015 --> 35:32.100
I wasn't sure
you'd be in today.

35:32.102 --> 35:34.636
You know us Brits;
we keep it all inside.

35:34.638 --> 35:37.805
Did you get a psych eval?

35:37.807 --> 35:40.391
Charming little chat
over tea.

35:40.393 --> 35:42.143
Evan.

35:42.145 --> 35:43.945
I'm alive.

35:43.947 --> 35:45.313
That's what
I'm focusing on--

35:45.315 --> 35:48.333
that and how I could
have been so moronic

35:48.335 --> 35:52.287
to have this guy under my wing
and not even see it.

35:52.289 --> 35:54.873
You didn't ask for him;
he came to you.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.575
I wouldn't be so
hard on yourself,

35:57.577 --> 36:00.245
and you figured
it out... mostly.

36:00.247 --> 36:03.798
I'm used to seeing
the aftermath

36:03.800 --> 36:05.032
of these kind of guys,

36:05.034 --> 36:08.253
but to be face to face
with one,

36:08.255 --> 36:11.839
to see that he had
no remorse, no emotion...

36:13.676 --> 36:17.345
Do you remember any
of what happened to him?

36:17.347 --> 36:20.081
I don't think I'll ever forget.

36:23.519 --> 36:27.822
All I know is that
whatever killed Peter,

36:27.824 --> 36:29.774
it wasn't entirely human.

36:29.776 --> 36:31.976
What do you mean?
I think you know.

36:33.862 --> 36:36.781
To a degree.

36:36.783 --> 36:38.783
What you went through
with your mom in the woods.

36:38.785 --> 36:41.703
Yeah, and after years
of couch surfing

36:41.705 --> 36:43.087
with a dozen therapists,

36:43.089 --> 36:45.239
I realized it was
all in my head.

36:45.241 --> 36:47.542
I went through this
horrific experience

36:47.544 --> 36:50.545
and my mind tried
to make sense of it.

36:50.547 --> 36:52.079
I heard flesh ripping,

36:52.081 --> 36:55.300
not just being severed,
but ripped apart, Catherine.

36:55.302 --> 36:57.352
I swear,
it was some kind of...

36:57.354 --> 36:58.586
Evan, I'm not
questioning

36:58.588 --> 37:00.772
what you went through.

37:00.774 --> 37:03.424
I just-- I know how easy
it is to see the beast

37:03.426 --> 37:04.859
when there is none.

37:08.614 --> 37:11.199
Ev... Evan, you're okay now.

37:11.201 --> 37:13.368
You're safe.

37:14.386 --> 37:16.571
That's what matters.

37:26.448 --> 37:29.083
Morning.

37:30.836 --> 37:32.420
So, you know those firefighters
I was talking to

37:32.422 --> 37:33.671
at the party
the other night?

37:33.673 --> 37:35.757
This ends badly
for me, doesn't it?

37:35.759 --> 37:37.958
Strickland, the cute
one, is into you,

37:37.960 --> 37:40.645
and the only way he'll go out
is if he has his wingman,

37:40.647 --> 37:42.230
the hot one with
the arm tattoo.

37:42.232 --> 37:43.314
That's a lot of math.

37:43.316 --> 37:45.183
Double date on them.

37:45.185 --> 37:47.151
This is entrapment.

37:47.153 --> 37:50.104
This is fun-- something
you're in desperate need of.

37:52.908 --> 37:53.908
Okay, it's happening.

37:53.910 --> 37:55.076
You're distracted.

37:55.078 --> 37:56.911
Who is he?

37:57.997 --> 38:00.815
Okay, there,

38:00.817 --> 38:03.284
there was this guy
that I was kind of into,

38:03.286 --> 38:05.820
but it doesn't matter.
Okay,

38:05.822 --> 38:08.089
well, the best way to get over
an "it doesn't matter" guy

38:08.091 --> 38:10.091
is to find a new one,
preferably one

38:10.093 --> 38:11.826
who looks good bare-chested
in red suspenders.

38:11.828 --> 38:14.679
Oh, no,

38:14.681 --> 38:17.181
that is not the face of someone
who's happy we solved the case.

38:17.183 --> 38:20.184
Just, uh, seeing what was left
of our perp last night.

38:20.186 --> 38:22.169
Psycho deserved it--
off the record.

38:22.171 --> 38:24.522
Now, that is for the courts
to decide.

38:24.524 --> 38:26.891
Our vigilante stepped
way across the line.

38:26.893 --> 38:28.609
He's out of control
and he just jumped

38:28.611 --> 38:30.678
to the top
of our most wanted list.

38:32.731 --> 38:34.449
Every precinct
is on this.

38:34.451 --> 38:36.517
Okay, this guy's got
to get brought in.

38:36.519 --> 38:38.686
It looks like there's been
attacks all over town.

38:38.688 --> 38:40.705
Somebody out there
knows something

38:40.707 --> 38:42.940
and is just
not talking.

38:42.942 --> 38:45.710
Eight incidents
in the past month.

38:45.712 --> 38:48.463

that would have prevented

exactly what happened
in the tunnel,

39:51.945 --> 39:53.194

Look,

39:54.497 --> 39:56.230
Vincent was my only hope
of saving Evan.

39:56.232 --> 39:57.431
I took a chance.

39:57.433 --> 39:59.400
You may have saved Evan,

containment.

40:48.535 --> 40:49.584
You can't keep him
in that.

40:49.586 --> 40:50.501
He's dangerous.

If he's not in control
of himself,

40:52.422 --> 40:53.704
somebody needs to be.

40:53.706 --> 40:55.673

a way to fix this.

I am getting you
out of here.

Give me the key.

41:01.548 --> 41:03.898
That might be a little
harder than it seems.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.267
We retraced Vincent's steps

41:06.269 --> 41:10.221
and looked at what's triggering
his blackouts.

41:10.223 --> 41:12.423

going to dinner,

41:12.425 --> 41:14.559
