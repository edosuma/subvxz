- Are you coming to bed?
- Hmm.

01:58.090 --> 01:59.990
Fi?

01:59.992 --> 02:01.762
It's tomorrow, the...

02:03.963 --> 02:05.797
My conjoined twins. Judgement.

02:05.799 --> 02:07.898
I've got the bloody
Archbishop of Westminster

02:07.900 --> 02:08.799
breathing down my neck.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.638
Oh, yeah.

02:11.270 --> 02:13.006
OK.

02:15.042 --> 02:18.008
Oh, do you wanna play doubles
on Saturday morning

02:18.010 --> 02:19.546
with the Wards?

02:19.979 --> 02:21.715
Hmm?

02:24.116 --> 02:25.786
Singles.

02:35.062 --> 02:38.897
"Michael's heart is normal
and sustains them both."

02:38.899 --> 02:41.902
"Luke's brain..."

03:20.774 --> 03:22.139
Judiciary guilty!

03:22.141 --> 03:24.277
Let God decide!

03:35.855 --> 03:37.591
Hey, hey.

03:39.393 --> 03:42.663
- Court rise.
- You're cutting it fine.

03:55.675 --> 04:00.278
If the twins remain joined,
both babies will die.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.281
If the hospital is granted
permission to separate them,

04:04.283 --> 04:06.184
Luke will die instantly,

04:06.186 --> 04:08.752
while Michael
is likely to develop

04:08.754 --> 04:11.189
into a normal healthy child.

04:11.191 --> 04:16.728
The logic of the lesser evil
is clear,

04:16.730 --> 04:21.332
one child flourishing better
than two dead.

04:21.334 --> 04:26.336
But if the doctors invade
Luke's body and sever his aorta,

04:26.338 --> 04:29.310
with the inevitable consequence
of his death,

04:30.444 --> 04:33.978
why is that not murder?

04:33.980 --> 04:36.346
The loving parents
of these twins

04:36.348 --> 04:40.952
refuse to sanction such an act
of premeditated killing.

04:40.954 --> 04:45.757
God has given life,
they have argued in this court,

04:45.759 --> 04:49.127
and only God can take it away.

04:49.129 --> 04:51.195
It has been difficult,

04:51.197 --> 04:54.865
under such pressure of time
and intense public interest,

04:54.867 --> 04:58.002
to arrive
at settled legal principle,

04:58.004 --> 05:02.039
but the obvious
is worth stating.

05:02.041 --> 05:07.045
This court is a court of law,
not of morals.

05:07.047 --> 05:09.947
Do you think
the verdict was right?

05:09.949 --> 05:11.348
Can you tell us
how you're feeling?

05:11.350 --> 05:13.019
Just this way, please.

05:14.521 --> 05:17.788
"Today the court has granted
the hospital a licence

05:17.790 --> 05:20.091
to murder one of our children."

05:20.093 --> 05:22.493
"Mrs Justice Maye
has taken a scalpel

05:22.495 --> 05:25.799
to the heart of reason
and justice."

05:34.040 --> 05:36.774
Royal courts
of injustice!

05:36.776 --> 05:41.115
My Lady, I think you'll be fine
going out the usual way.

06:07.072 --> 06:08.839
<i>I will leave you
with Flaubert's</i>

06:08.841 --> 06:12.510
celebrated observation
regarding Lucretius.

06:12.512 --> 06:16.346
"With the gods gone
and Christ not yet come,

06:16.348 --> 06:20.185
there was a unique moment,
from Cicero to Marcus Aurelius,

06:20.187 --> 06:23.324
when man stood alone."

06:25.591 --> 06:27.358
So, there you have it.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.529
Before Christianity
began to close the Western mind,

06:31.531 --> 06:33.063
what was briefly possible then

06:33.065 --> 06:37.470
was 'the fixity
of a pensive gaze'.

07:01.494 --> 07:03.864
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:04.363 --> 07:05.997
How'd it go?

07:05.999 --> 07:08.632
I gave instructions
to slaughter a baby.

07:08.634 --> 07:10.334
That's what it said in the...

07:10.336 --> 07:14.238
Oh, yeah. Right, I saw that.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.476
Sorry. Ridiculous.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.277
Well, I'll tell you,

07:20.279 --> 07:23.081
I'll make reservations
for dinner,

07:23.083 --> 07:25.183
'cause I've had
a shit-awful day myself.

07:25.185 --> 07:29.954
And we'll go
drink some wine and...

07:29.956 --> 07:33.123
And I can get some opera tickets
for Saturday night.

07:33.125 --> 07:36.026
No, I'm duty judge all weekend.

07:36.028 --> 07:37.327
- You can't switch it?
- Mm-mm.

07:37.329 --> 07:40.565
- Two judgements for Monday.
- Mmm.

07:40.567 --> 07:43.668
- What?
- No, nothing.

07:43.670 --> 07:47.372
It's just... like last weekend
and the 50 weekends before that.

07:47.374 --> 07:49.910
Well, that's how it is.

07:50.442 --> 07:52.947
Yes. Yes.

07:58.685 --> 08:01.254
Um... look...

08:03.189 --> 08:07.294
I don't know how to say this,
um, but here it is.

08:10.463 --> 08:12.596
I think...

08:16.536 --> 08:19.072
I think I wanna have an affair.

08:19.605 --> 08:21.238
What?

08:21.240 --> 08:24.108
Yeah, I'm going to, um...

08:24.110 --> 08:26.144
I mean, you shouldn't be
surprised by this.

08:26.146 --> 08:29.313
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

08:29.315 --> 08:34.017
Fi... when was the last time
that we made love?

08:34.019 --> 08:37.287
- No idea.
- No, you wouldn't.

08:37.289 --> 08:40.157
You once told me
that couples in long marriages

08:40.159 --> 08:42.326
often ended up like siblings.

08:42.328 --> 08:45.198
Well, here we are.

08:46.231 --> 08:48.398
I love you, but...

08:48.400 --> 08:51.536
- You're serious about this?
- Mm-hm.

08:51.538 --> 08:53.606
You're being...

08:59.346 --> 09:02.347
Do you remember how we were?

09:02.349 --> 09:04.585
Do you remember how we...?

09:06.052 --> 09:08.254
Don't you miss that?

09:12.993 --> 09:14.528
OK.

09:16.663 --> 09:18.396
Jack.

09:18.398 --> 09:23.133
Jack. It's already started,
hasn't it?

09:23.135 --> 09:25.136
Tell me the truth.
What's her name?

09:25.138 --> 09:26.738
I can tell you honestly
that it hasn't started yet.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.440
- What's her name?
- Melanie.

09:29.442 --> 09:32.009
- Not the mathematician?
- She's a statistician.

09:32.011 --> 09:33.444
The one who came round
for dinner

09:33.446 --> 09:35.079
and talked us into a stupor

09:35.081 --> 09:38.215
and wrecked our floor
with her stilettos?

09:38.217 --> 09:40.118
That's absurd.
She's half your age.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.420
Look, you wanna live like this?

09:42.422 --> 09:47.224
Fine. I don't.
I'm going to have this affair.

09:47.226 --> 09:49.627
And a divorce and the child
I've failed to give you?

09:49.629 --> 09:52.463
No. No divorce,
no deception, no lies.

09:52.465 --> 09:56.334
I love you
and we're meant to be together,

09:56.336 --> 09:59.302
but... look, I could have gone
behind your back.

09:59.304 --> 10:04.441
How very kind. I can't believe
how cool we are. Open marriage.

10:04.443 --> 10:06.544
The time to suggest that, Jack,
was before the wedding,

10:06.546 --> 10:08.345
not 20 years afterwards.

10:08.347 --> 10:10.180
Such a cliché.

10:10.182 --> 10:11.581
You do this, it's the end.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.084
- Simple as that.
- Threat?

10:14.086 --> 10:15.655
Promise.

10:32.572 --> 10:34.805
- 11 months.
- What?

10:34.807 --> 10:36.807
You said you had no idea,
so I'll tell you.

10:36.809 --> 10:38.408
- What?
- 11 months.

10:38.410 --> 10:40.111
It's been 11 months.

10:40.113 --> 10:42.379
Almost to the day.

10:42.381 --> 10:44.315
I marked it in my diary.
Special event.

10:44.317 --> 10:48.118
Oh, God. Jack, this is...

10:48.120 --> 10:51.189
This is so unfair. I have had
the conjoined twins case...

10:51.191 --> 10:54.191
Yes, I know, and before them
the Orthodox Jewish schoolgirls,

10:54.193 --> 10:56.259
and before them
the bad father from Bahrain,

10:56.261 --> 10:58.095
and before him the baby
in the phone box...

10:58.097 --> 10:59.696
Are you already
having this affair?

10:59.698 --> 11:02.333
If you are, I'd like you
to pack a bag now and leave.

11:02.335 --> 11:04.134
I told you that I'm not.

11:04.136 --> 11:06.739
Well, you've had your answer,
so now what?

11:10.342 --> 11:13.411
Don't you miss it, Fi?

11:13.413 --> 11:15.713
Or is just 'cause you don't
want it, I can't have it?

11:15.715 --> 11:17.518
Is that the deal?

11:21.120 --> 11:27.394
You have to understand that
it's not just about the sex.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.361
It's...

11:30.363 --> 11:32.563
We don't even kiss any more.

11:32.565 --> 11:34.835
Barely a peck on the cheek.
It...

11:37.403 --> 11:39.539
Or is it just me you don't want?

11:59.893 --> 12:02.759
- Yeah.
- <i>Sorry to disturb you.</i>

12:02.761 --> 12:04.728
Go ahead.

12:04.730 --> 12:07.165
<i>A call from the out-of-hours
Urgent Business Associate</i>

12:07.167 --> 12:08.598
<i>on behalf of counsel</i>

12:08.600 --> 12:10.800
representing
a hospital in Wandsworth.

12:10.802 --> 12:13.603
They urgently need to give blood
to a cancer patient.

12:13.605 --> 12:15.506
It's a boy of 17.

12:15.508 --> 12:18.309
<i>Now, he and his parents
are refusing.</i>

12:18.311 --> 12:19.810
<i>Why are they refusing?</i>

12:19.812 --> 12:22.246
- They're Jehovah's Witnesses.
- <i>Go on.</i>

12:22.248 --> 12:23.781
<i>The hospital
is seeking an order</i>

12:23.783 --> 12:26.184
<i>to proceed
against their wishes.</i>

12:26.186 --> 12:28.853
- How long have we got?
- <i>Perhaps four days.</i>

12:28.855 --> 12:32.723
List it for hearing at short
notice the day after tomorrow.

12:32.725 --> 12:34.324
<i>Give notice to the respondents.</i>

12:34.326 --> 12:35.926
Direct the hospital
to inform the parents.

12:35.928 --> 12:37.627
They'll have liberty
to apply for legal aid.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.629
The boy will need
legal representation.

12:39.631 --> 12:41.799
I want the hospital to serve
evidence by four tomorrow

12:41.801 --> 12:44.201
with a witness statement
from the treating oncologist.

12:44.203 --> 12:46.503
I'll need to know
why transfusion is necessary.

12:46.505 --> 12:48.406
And the parents
should use their best endeavours

12:48.408 --> 12:50.440
to file evidence
by noon on Thursday.

12:50.442 --> 12:51.912
OK, thanks. Bye.

12:59.284 --> 13:02.752
<i>Why is blood
so important to God?</i>

13:02.754 --> 13:04.854
<i>Why is God so insistent?</i>

13:04.856 --> 13:06.656
<i>Yes, Sarah?</i>

13:06.658 --> 13:09.926
Because that's where the soul
is, right in the blood,

13:09.928 --> 13:12.530
and therefore it belongs to him.

13:12.532 --> 13:14.331
Very good indeed.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.900
The soul, the life,

13:15.902 --> 13:20.503
it's in the blood,
and it's not ours, it's God's.

13:20.505 --> 13:24.842
Now let us pray
for our dear friend, Adam Henry,

13:24.844 --> 13:27.911
and a prayer of faith
will make the sick one well

13:27.913 --> 13:30.484
<i>and Jehovah will raise him up.</i>

13:38.658 --> 13:40.826
Jack?

17:26.853 --> 17:28.885
Good morning, My Lady.
I trust you had a good evening.

17:28.887 --> 17:31.588
Absolutely marvellous. Quiet.

17:31.590 --> 17:33.257
- And you?
- Very pleasant, thank you.

17:33.259 --> 17:36.259
I went fishing with Dominic
on the River Lea.

17:36.261 --> 17:40.564
Catch anything? Don't tell me.
What have we got?

17:40.566 --> 17:42.132
You have the child
abducted to Morocco,

17:42.134 --> 17:43.834
Hague Convention,
listed for ten,

17:43.836 --> 17:46.103
some routine
maintenance pending suits,

17:46.105 --> 17:48.205
an ex-parte application
to exclude a husband

17:48.207 --> 17:49.573
from the matrimonial home,

17:49.575 --> 17:50.975
and this Jehovah's Witness boy

17:50.977 --> 17:53.744
listed for tomorrow
as requested.

17:53.746 --> 17:55.011
The parents are making

17:55.013 --> 17:56.779
an emergency application
for legal aid.

17:56.781 --> 17:59.115
The certificate should
go through this afternoon.

17:59.117 --> 18:00.683
A lot of press interest already.

18:00.685 --> 18:02.952
Oh, and your singing friend,
Mr Berner,

18:02.954 --> 18:04.787
will be acting for the hospital.

18:04.789 --> 18:06.690
The boy has a form
of leukaemia...

18:06.692 --> 18:08.992
The boy, the boy.
Let's at least give him a name.

18:08.994 --> 18:12.563
Of course, My Lady.
Adam. Adam Henry.

18:12.565 --> 18:16.633
An only child. Very devout.
Awfully precocious, they say.

18:16.635 --> 18:20.671
His parents are Kevin and Naomi,
also very devout.

18:20.673 --> 18:22.605
Mr Henry runs
his own small company,

18:22.607 --> 18:23.841
groundwork, land drainage.

18:23.843 --> 18:25.142
Apparently he's quite a virtuoso

18:25.144 --> 18:26.677
with a mechanical digger.

18:26.679 --> 18:28.679
- Whereas Mrs Henry...
- That's enough.

18:28.681 --> 18:30.484
Sorry. Damn.

18:31.951 --> 18:34.086
I'll get my own coffee.

18:36.821 --> 18:42.293
Um, no, could you please send
the new keys to my clerk?

18:42.295 --> 18:45.228
Yes, I'll let the porter know
to expect you.

18:45.230 --> 18:46.896
Right, good.

18:46.898 --> 18:48.634
Thanks.

18:54.906 --> 18:56.907
Oh, Fiona. Fiona, Fiona.

18:56.909 --> 18:58.609
Oh, Sherwood.

18:58.611 --> 19:01.010
- Bloody hell. My coffee.
- Got a gem for you.

19:01.012 --> 19:02.947
- I haven't got time.
- It won't take a second.

19:02.949 --> 19:04.347
- I had it from Sedley.
- Look at this sleeve.

19:04.349 --> 19:07.918
Listen. Cross-examiner asks
a pathologist

19:07.920 --> 19:09.819
if he can be absolutely sure

19:09.821 --> 19:13.090
that a certain patient was dead
before he began the autopsy.

19:13.092 --> 19:15.926
"Absolutely sure,"
says the pathologist.

19:15.928 --> 19:17.894
"Oh. How can you be so sure?"

19:17.896 --> 19:19.330
"Because," says the pathologist,

19:19.332 --> 19:22.065
"his brain was sitting in a jar
on my desk."

19:22.067 --> 19:23.834
"Ah," says counsel.

19:23.836 --> 19:27.638
"But couldn't the patient
be alive nevertheless?"

19:27.640 --> 19:29.172
"Well," says the pathologist,

19:29.174 --> 19:31.040
"it's possible
he could have been alive

19:31.042 --> 19:34.111
and practising law somewhere."

19:34.113 --> 19:38.118
Practising law.

19:53.932 --> 19:55.899
- Let me take that.
- Yes, thank you.

19:57.936 --> 19:59.772
Practising law.

20:02.741 --> 20:04.844
Court rise.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.854
- May it please you, My Lady.
- Yes, Mr Soames.

20:17.856 --> 20:21.057
My Lady, may I refer you
to my client's undertaking...

20:21.059 --> 20:22.926
Your client, Mr Soames,
is in direct breach

20:22.928 --> 20:24.761
of his undertaking
to this court.

20:24.763 --> 20:26.764
He's removed his daughter
from the jurisdiction.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.198
Now, I hear, he's in Rabat,

20:28.200 --> 20:29.967
with no intention
of returning her.

20:29.969 --> 20:31.401
I was rather expecting
to find you

20:31.403 --> 20:33.807
blushing on his behalf.

20:36.107 --> 20:38.441
Your client claims
that the £7 million

20:38.443 --> 20:40.911
he has been ordered to pay
his former wife

20:40.913 --> 20:43.680
belongs to the company
and is not his to give.

20:43.682 --> 20:45.382
I find this is not the case.

20:45.384 --> 20:47.918
I am satisfied that the company
is nothing more than a fig leaf

20:47.920 --> 20:49.452
for a beneficial
tax arrangement.

20:49.454 --> 20:52.256
I shall make
the charging order forthwith.

20:52.258 --> 20:55.092
- Yes, Mr Blackwell.
- My Lady.

20:55.094 --> 20:58.062
This is an ex-parte application
to exclude

20:58.064 --> 21:00.430
an unreasonable husband
from the matrimonial home...

21:00.432 --> 21:03.267
Why in heaven's name are you
doing this without notice?

21:03.269 --> 21:05.869
I see nothing in the papers
that would make that necessary.

21:05.871 --> 21:08.872
What communication have you had
with the other side? None.

21:08.874 --> 21:11.240
If the husband's willing to give
an undertaking to your client,

21:11.242 --> 21:13.177
then you really shouldn't be
bothering me with this.

21:13.179 --> 21:15.379
If he isn't, then serve notice
and I'll hear both sides.

21:15.381 --> 21:17.150
All rise.

21:20.885 --> 21:23.120
I've got another beginning
on Thursday.

21:23.122 --> 21:24.858
It's just too soon.

21:29.461 --> 21:32.930
My Lady, that Mr Berner,
who'll be before you tomorrow.

21:32.932 --> 21:34.797
- Yes?
- His clerk called.

21:34.799 --> 21:36.900
To remind you that you have
a rehearsal tonight.

21:36.902 --> 21:39.803
- No.
- 7:30 at your flat.

21:39.805 --> 21:41.740
As arranged.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.176
Thank you.

22:22.847 --> 22:24.717
Get them out.

22:39.164 --> 22:41.401
Thank you, gentlemen.
Ten minutes.

22:43.903 --> 22:46.372
Young man,
I really need to talk to you.

23:55.406 --> 23:57.576
Bloody thing.

23:59.545 --> 24:01.879
Well, why don't you
put that down, for a start?

24:01.881 --> 24:04.314
Thank you. Thanks. Oops.

24:04.316 --> 24:07.617
- Where's Jack, anyway?
- Oh, conference. Birmingham.

24:07.619 --> 24:09.987
Poor sod. Right, there.

24:09.989 --> 24:13.923
- You alright? You look a bit...
- No, I'm fine. Um...

24:13.925 --> 24:17.193
They've given us 15 minutes,
which includes an encore.

24:17.195 --> 24:19.161
Did I tell you
I'm giving up the law?

24:19.163 --> 24:23.033
Not again.
Shall we do the carol first?

24:23.035 --> 24:24.968
- Hmm?
- I just had this case.

24:24.970 --> 24:27.437
So there's a pavement brawl
outside a pub in Kentish Town.

24:27.439 --> 24:30.539
My poor fool, he's just standing
on the edge watching his mates.

24:30.541 --> 24:32.241
The whole thing's on CCTV.

24:32.243 --> 24:34.443
Someone gets a broken jaw,
so it's GBH,

24:34.445 --> 24:37.980
and they're all sent down,
including my kid.

24:37.982 --> 24:40.417
Two and a half years for a crime
he wasn't even charged with.

24:40.419 --> 24:43.019
So-called joint enterprise.
Nothing I could do.

24:43.021 --> 24:44.488
- Category three?
- Yep.

24:44.490 --> 24:46.390
In front of Charles Mackay.

24:46.392 --> 24:48.392
He went six months
below the guidelines.

24:48.394 --> 24:49.660
Count yourself lucky.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.228
A fight between
consenting adults.

24:51.230 --> 24:53.130
Victim didn't even
need treatment.

24:53.132 --> 24:56.466
Four working-class kids,
clean records,

24:56.468 --> 24:58.035
two with babies, all in work.

24:58.037 --> 24:59.937
They're taxpayers.

24:59.939 --> 25:01.571
Mark, let's get started.

25:01.573 --> 25:04.207
Where are the words?

25:04.209 --> 25:06.476
It's bloody class warfare,
Fiona.

25:06.478 --> 25:08.378
Pointless. I hereby give up.

25:08.380 --> 25:12.015
No, you don't. You're in front
of me tomorrow and...

25:12.017 --> 25:15.117
<i>♪ Lully, lullay</i>

25:15.119 --> 25:18.988
<i>♪ Thou little tiny child...</i>

25:25.064 --> 25:30.199
<i>This is the BBC World
Service. The news at 0400 GMT.</i>

25:30.201 --> 25:33.402
<i>Rescue operations continue

25:33.404 --> 25:35.372
<i>in the wake of Storm Ada.</i>

25:35.374 --> 25:38.111
<i>Rail and road
connections to Montpelier...</i>

25:40.378 --> 25:43.113
There's a bit of a media scrum.

25:43.115 --> 25:45.082
Say nothing.

25:49.755 --> 25:52.756
- Naomi! Naomi! Kevin, this way!
- Let us through.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.758
- Let us through.
- Look over here, love. Naomi.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.594
- Please, let us through.
- Naomi, nice one, sweetheart.

25:58.596 --> 26:02.164
- That's it.
- Naomi, darling.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.503
Kevin. Kevin.
Talk to me, please.

26:06.704 --> 26:09.506
They have absolutely nothing
to say at this stage.

26:09.508 --> 26:12.375
- Now, please...
- Just something about the boy.

26:12.377 --> 26:15.612
- Anything...
- Excuse us. Excuse us.

26:15.614 --> 26:17.113
OK, the judge is ready for you.

26:17.115 --> 26:20.049
No. There's nothing to say, OK?

26:20.051 --> 26:22.421
- Yeah, they're ready now.
- Oh, thank you.

26:37.403 --> 26:39.238
My Lady, they're ready for you.

26:51.450 --> 26:53.653
Court rise.

27:03.595 --> 27:06.432
In the matter of A, a child.

27:12.637 --> 27:15.639
We are here
on a matter of extreme urgency,

27:15.641 --> 27:17.507
of life and death.

27:17.509 --> 27:19.809
Time is of the essence.
Please bear this in mind.

27:19.811 --> 27:22.511
Speak briefly and to the point.
Mr Berner.

27:22.513 --> 27:25.282
I... I shall indeed be brief,
My Lady.

27:25.284 --> 27:26.816
The applicant in the matter

27:26.818 --> 27:29.286
is the Edith Frances Hospital,
Wandsworth,

27:29.288 --> 27:31.087
which is seeking
the leave of this court

27:31.089 --> 27:33.390
to treat a teenager, Adam.

27:33.392 --> 27:35.092
He's 17 years and nine months.

27:35.094 --> 27:36.826
He first experienced
stomach pains at school.

27:36.828 --> 27:39.129
I've read the papers, Mr Berner.

27:39.131 --> 27:42.466
My Lady, I believe all parties
accept that Adam has leukaemia.

27:42.468 --> 27:45.102
The hospital wishes to treat him
with four drugs,

27:45.104 --> 27:47.671
a universally recognised
therapy, as I can show.

27:47.673 --> 27:50.774
- No need.
- Thank you, My Lady.

27:50.776 --> 27:52.875
Two of these drugs
have the side effect

27:52.877 --> 27:54.344
of attacking the bone marrow,

27:54.346 --> 27:56.379
compromising the body's
immune system,

27:56.381 --> 27:59.815
therefore it's standard
to transfuse during treatment.

27:59.817 --> 28:02.818
However, the boy and his parents
are Jehovah's Witnesses

28:02.820 --> 28:04.386
and it's contrary to their faith

28:04.388 --> 28:06.389
to accept blood products
into their system.

28:06.391 --> 28:09.426
This apart,
Adam and his parents agree

28:09.428 --> 28:11.527
to any treatment
the hospital can offer.

28:11.529 --> 28:14.597
At this point I'd like to call
the consultant haematologist.

28:14.599 --> 28:16.732
Fine.

28:16.734 --> 28:19.635
Professor Carter, bring us
up to date on Adam's condition.

28:19.637 --> 28:21.270
It's not good, he's weak,

28:21.272 --> 28:22.838
and, as I would expect,
he's beginning to show

28:22.840 --> 28:24.673
the first signs
of breathlessness.

28:24.675 --> 28:27.143
His haemoglobin counts
are dropping steadily.

28:27.145 --> 28:30.680
The norm is 12.5.
This morning it was 4.5.

28:30.682 --> 28:32.481
And the white cell count?

28:32.483 --> 28:34.884
Well, they should be
somewhere between 5 and 9.

28:34.886 --> 28:37.187
He was showing 1.7.

28:37.189 --> 28:39.555
- As for the platelets...
- Remind me of their function.

28:39.557 --> 28:42.424
They're necessary for clotting,
My Lady.

28:42.426 --> 28:46.696
The norm is 250. Adam's count
this morning was 34.

28:46.698 --> 28:48.430
A healthy adolescent produces

28:48.432 --> 28:51.334
500 billion blood cells
every day.

28:51.336 --> 28:53.870
Adam is producing
no blood at all.

28:53.872 --> 28:56.405
And if you could transfuse
this patient...?

28:56.407 --> 28:59.209
Then he would stand
a decent chance.

28:59.211 --> 29:01.210
Have you discussed
with Adam

29:01.212 --> 29:03.712
what will happen to him
if he's not transfused?

29:03.714 --> 29:06.482
Well, I've spared him the
details. He knows he could die.

29:06.484 --> 29:09.451
What knowledge does he have
of the manner of his death?

29:09.453 --> 29:11.124
Nothing at all.

29:11.923 --> 29:14.793
Then perhaps you could tell us?

29:17.596 --> 29:19.595
It'll be very distressing
for everyone,

29:19.597 --> 29:20.896
including the medical team.

29:20.898 --> 29:22.532
They simply can't understand

29:22.534 --> 29:24.500
why they should risk
losing this patient.

29:24.502 --> 29:27.237
He'll fight to breathe
and he's bound to lose.

29:27.239 --> 29:28.939
It'll be frightening,
like drowning.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.574
Before that, there will be
internal bleeding perhaps,

29:31.576 --> 29:33.742
perhaps renal failure.

29:33.744 --> 29:35.378
Some patients lose their sight.

29:35.380 --> 29:38.215
He may have a stroke.
Patients vary.

29:38.217 --> 29:41.754
The one sure thing is that
it will be a horrible death.

29:43.321 --> 29:44.821
Do you agree, Professor,

29:44.823 --> 29:47.524
that the freedom of choice
in medical treatment

29:47.526 --> 29:49.392
is a fundamental human right?

29:49.394 --> 29:50.794
In adults, yes, I agree.

29:50.796 --> 29:52.562
Adam is very close
to being an adult.

29:52.564 --> 29:55.398
If his 18th birthday
were tomorrow morning,

29:55.400 --> 29:57.834
he wouldn't legally be an adult
this afternoon.

29:57.836 --> 29:59.335
I think we can agree

29:59.337 --> 30:01.337
that Adam
is very nearly an adult,

30:01.339 --> 30:02.972
and isn't it the case
that he's expressed

30:02.974 --> 30:04.440
his views to you intelligently?

30:04.442 --> 30:06.308
His views
are his parents' views.

30:06.310 --> 30:07.811
His objections
to blood transfusion

30:07.813 --> 30:10.247
are the doctrines
of a religious cult

30:10.249 --> 30:12.282
for which he's likely to become
a pointless martyr.

30:12.284 --> 30:13.882
You took the oath.

30:13.884 --> 30:16.253
- I assume you're a Christian?
- I am an Anglican.

30:16.255 --> 30:19.689
Is the Church of England a cult?

30:19.691 --> 30:21.958
Are you aware that
the World Health Organization

30:21.960 --> 30:24.661
estimates that up to 20%
of new AIDS cases

30:24.663 --> 30:26.863
are caused
by blood transfusions?

30:26.865 --> 30:29.266
And transfusion brings
other dangers.

30:29.268 --> 30:33.436
Hepatitis, Lyme disease,
malaria, syphilis,

30:33.438 --> 30:37.740
Chagas' disease,
graft-versus-host disease,

30:37.742 --> 30:40.776
transfusion-related
lung disease, variant CJD.

30:40.778 --> 30:43.013
Very rarely happens
and never under me.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.815
So if we added up
all the dangers,

30:45.817 --> 30:47.383
wouldn't you say
there was enough

30:47.385 --> 30:49.018
to give a rational person pause?

30:49.020 --> 30:50.687
The blood products we use

30:50.689 --> 30:52.756
are tested
to the highest standard.

30:52.758 --> 30:55.025
But it wouldn't be
unreasonable, surely,

30:55.027 --> 30:57.760
given all the potential
for infection and error,

30:57.762 --> 30:59.996
for a patient to insist
his consent be sought.

30:59.998 --> 31:01.698
You're playing with words.

31:01.700 --> 31:04.066
If I'm not allowed
to transfuse this boy,

31:04.068 --> 31:05.802
we may lose him.

31:05.804 --> 31:08.071
Jehovah's Witnesses patients
are often treated now

31:08.073 --> 31:09.805
by what's called
bloodless surgery.

31:09.807 --> 31:12.007
Look, we're not dealing
with surgery here.

31:12.009 --> 31:13.977
This boy needs blood
because his treatment

31:13.979 --> 31:15.778
prevents him making
any of his own.

31:15.780 --> 31:19.783
- It's as simple as that.
- Thank you, Professor.

31:19.785 --> 31:23.719
Thank you for your time,
Professor Carter.

31:23.721 --> 31:27.657
We'll take a break. 20 minutes.

31:27.659 --> 31:29.662
Court rise.

31:51.650 --> 31:53.682
- Jack?
- Oh, hi.

31:53.684 --> 31:55.751
I thought
you were gonna be in court.

31:55.753 --> 31:57.921
<i>I was just gonna leave you
a message. Um...</i>

31:57.923 --> 32:00.824
- Where are you? What's going...
- <i>You know what? I have to go.</i>

32:00.826 --> 32:02.761
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Oh, for God's sake!

32:21.779 --> 32:24.814
From that point on,
we never looked back.

32:24.816 --> 32:28.051
I stopped drinking,
got my training,

32:28.053 --> 32:32.988
and me... me and Naomi
became good with each other,

32:32.990 --> 32:34.923
and looking after Adam properly.

32:34.925 --> 32:39.895
And he was calmer, and
he started doing well at school.

32:39.897 --> 32:43.967
And we had a lot of support
from our Kingdom Hall

32:43.969 --> 32:45.802
and good friends there.

32:45.804 --> 32:47.937
You know, the sort of people
who never let you down.

32:47.939 --> 32:52.475
We were happy.
We've lived in the truth.

32:52.477 --> 32:56.645
And now, Mr Henry,
your son has leukaemia

32:56.647 --> 32:59.949
and you and Naomi are facing
the ultimate test of faith.

32:59.951 --> 33:03.686
- Is that how you'd put it?
- That's exactly what it is.

33:03.688 --> 33:09.758
Can you tell the court
why you and your wife and Adam

33:09.760 --> 33:12.461
are refusing
a blood transfusion?

33:12.463 --> 33:16.932
What you have to understand
is that blood,

33:16.934 --> 33:20.737
it's the essence
of what it means to be human.

33:20.739 --> 33:25.141
It's the gift of life that
we should all be grateful for.

33:25.143 --> 33:27.943
Just as life is sacred,
so's blood.

33:27.945 --> 33:33.749
So why would Adam refuse
such a gift from the doctors?

33:33.751 --> 33:35.517
Mixing your own blood

33:35.519 --> 33:39.055
with the blood of an animal
or another person

33:39.057 --> 33:42.862
is pollution,
it's contamination.

33:43.862 --> 33:46.996
It's a rejection of God's gift.

33:46.998 --> 33:49.231
That's why
he specifically forbids it

33:49.233 --> 33:52.969
in Genesis and Leviticus
and Acts.

33:52.971 --> 33:54.737
And our son, Adam,

33:54.739 --> 33:56.972
he knows that God's word
has to be obeyed.

33:56.974 --> 34:00.645
Do you and your wife
love your son, Mr Henry?

34:02.047 --> 34:04.613
Yes, we love him.

34:04.615 --> 34:08.150
And if refusing
a blood transfusion...

34:08.152 --> 34:10.085
should cause his death?

34:10.088 --> 34:11.954
Then he'd take his place

34:11.956 --> 34:14.891
in the kingdom of heaven
on earth that's to come.

34:14.893 --> 34:17.695
And how will you and Naomi feel?

34:22.099 --> 34:26.572
You'll be grief-stricken,
won't you, Mr Henry?

34:31.876 --> 34:37.614
So this refusal is Adam's
decision, not coming from you?

34:41.052 --> 34:42.788
He's a...

34:45.789 --> 34:48.123
He's a very...
He's a very special person.

34:48.126 --> 34:51.159
He's profound.

34:51.161 --> 34:53.795
We couldn't change his mind
even if we wanted to.

34:53.797 --> 34:56.733
I mean, no one could.

34:56.735 --> 34:59.769
Mr Henry, these books
of the Bible you mentioned.

34:59.771 --> 35:02.804
At the time of these Iron Age
texts, transfusion didn't exist.

35:02.806 --> 35:04.541
How on earth
could it be forbidden?

35:04.543 --> 35:07.142
It existed in the mind of God.

35:07.144 --> 35:09.045
Many Jehovah's Witnesses
accept blood products

35:09.047 --> 35:11.046
without compromising
their faith.

35:11.048 --> 35:14.050
Isn't it the case that there are
other options open to young Adam

35:14.052 --> 35:16.119
and you could, if you wanted,
play your part

35:16.121 --> 35:18.287
in persuading him to take them
and save his life?

35:18.289 --> 35:20.188
I don't know anyone

35:20.190 --> 35:22.659
who departs from the teachings
of the Governing Body.

35:22.661 --> 35:24.661
The elders give us
good guidance.

35:24.663 --> 35:27.195
The same strict elders who've
been visiting your son every day

35:27.197 --> 35:28.932
to make sure
he doesn't change his mind?

35:28.934 --> 35:30.967
These are kind and decent men.

35:30.969 --> 35:33.036
The other churches have priests
in the hospital too.

35:33.038 --> 35:37.005
It's true, isn't it, that
if Adam agreed to a transfusion,

35:37.007 --> 35:39.909
he'd be what you call
dis-fellowshipped,

35:39.911 --> 35:41.144
cast out of the community?

35:41.146 --> 35:42.579
Disassociated, actually,

35:42.581 --> 35:43.912
but it's not gonna happen

35:43.914 --> 35:45.782
because he isn't
gonna change his mind.

35:45.784 --> 35:49.251
He's in your care and it's
your mind I want to change.

35:49.253 --> 35:52.588
He's scared of being shunned.
Isn't that the term you use?

35:52.590 --> 35:54.990
The only world he knows
would turn its back on him

35:54.992 --> 35:57.159
for preferring life
to a terrible death.

35:57.161 --> 35:58.994
Does that sound like
a free choice?

35:58.996 --> 36:01.898
My Lady, if you spent
just five minutes with him,

36:01.900 --> 36:04.233
then you'd understand that this
is a very, very special person

36:04.235 --> 36:05.702
who knows his own mind.

36:05.704 --> 36:07.704
Mr Henry,
have you told Adam

36:07.706 --> 36:09.938
that if he saved his own life
and agreed to a transfusion,

36:09.940 --> 36:11.039
you'd still love him?

36:11.041 --> 36:12.208
We've told him we love him.

36:12.210 --> 36:13.742
- Is that all?
- It's enough.

36:13.744 --> 36:15.612
When were
the Jehovah's Witnesses

36:15.614 --> 36:17.347
commanded to refuse
blood transfusions?

36:17.349 --> 36:20.182
It's in Genesis.
It dates from the creation.

36:20.184 --> 36:21.985
It dates from 1945, doesn't it?

36:21.987 --> 36:25.021
A committee in Brooklyn
has decided your son's fate.

36:25.023 --> 36:28.090
There are deep truths that
weren't previously understood.

36:28.092 --> 36:30.025
The same is just as true
in science.

36:30.027 --> 36:32.327
Not much room for dissent
in your church, is there?

36:32.329 --> 36:34.329
You've probably no idea
what it means

36:34.331 --> 36:37.633
to submit to a higher authority.

36:37.635 --> 36:39.936
We do so of our own free will.

36:39.938 --> 36:41.403
When you were Adam's age,

36:41.405 --> 36:43.271
you wouldn't have known
your own mind.

36:43.273 --> 36:46.141
He's lived in the truth.
I didn't have that privilege.

36:46.143 --> 36:48.711
You say life is precious. Other
people's lives or just your own?

36:48.713 --> 36:51.146
All life is a gift of the Lord
and his to take away.

36:51.148 --> 36:53.883
Easy to say, Mr Henry,
when it's not your life.

36:53.885 --> 36:57.153
Harder to say
when it's your own son.

36:57.155 --> 36:58.920
- Is masturbation a sin?
- Yes.

36:58.922 --> 37:00.856
- And abortion? Homosexuality?
- Yes.

37:00.858 --> 37:03.860
Is this what Adam's
been taught to believe?

37:03.862 --> 37:06.195
That is what he knows
to be true.

37:06.197 --> 37:08.367
Thank you, Mr Henry.

37:10.702 --> 37:15.737
He said,
"I'm my own man."

37:15.739 --> 37:18.708
"I'm separate from my parents."

37:18.710 --> 37:22.081
"Whatever their ideas are,
I'm deciding for myself."

37:24.682 --> 37:26.851
"I'm prepared to die."

37:30.989 --> 37:33.755
Thank you, Mrs Greene.

37:33.757 --> 37:35.925
There's a crucial
difference between the right

37:35.927 --> 37:37.459
to assent to treatment

37:37.461 --> 37:40.329
and the right to refuse
life-saving treatment.

37:40.331 --> 37:42.231
My Lady, the law is clear.

37:42.233 --> 37:44.934
He has no autonomy in the matter
until he's 18.

37:44.936 --> 37:48.104
Slice it as my learned friend
may, he is not 18.

37:48.106 --> 37:50.972
In so important a matter,
there can be no sheltering

37:50.974 --> 37:53.342
behind the couple of months
that separate him

37:53.344 --> 37:54.976
from his 18th birthday.

37:54.978 --> 37:57.213
It's clear that Adam
has a full grasp

37:57.215 --> 37:58.815
of the religious principles

37:58.817 --> 38:01.883
on which
his refusal of treatment rests.

38:01.885 --> 38:05.454
It is a patient's basic right,
protected by common law,

38:05.456 --> 38:08.758
to refuse treatment.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.325
I submit
My Lady should not be tempted

38:10.327 --> 38:12.929
onto the dangerous ground
of undermining

38:12.931 --> 38:14.731
so fundamental a human right

38:14.733 --> 38:17.369
and the precious dignity
it confers.

38:32.083 --> 38:35.117
Given the unique circumstances
of this case,

38:35.119 --> 38:39.755
I have decided I would like
to hear from Adam himself.

38:39.757 --> 38:42.258
I need to know
if he understands his situation

38:42.260 --> 38:43.892
and what he confronts

38:43.894 --> 38:47.429
should I rule
against the hospital.

38:47.431 --> 38:51.233
I'll go now to Adam's bedside
in the company of his guardian.

38:51.235 --> 38:54.070
I'll give judgement
in open court when I return,

38:54.072 --> 38:55.537
probably after 7pm.

38:55.539 --> 38:58.009
Court rise.

39:03.081 --> 39:05.014
- Unconventional.
- Very eccentric.

39:05.016 --> 39:07.182
- But there's nothing we can do.
- Will it help...

39:07.184 --> 39:10.286
She's not working
to our deadline.

39:10.288 --> 39:11.920
Yeah, unbelievable.

39:11.922 --> 39:13.555
I've never known a judge
to do this.

39:13.557 --> 39:15.557
I know.
She's completely off the wall.

39:15.559 --> 39:17.061
Who knows what will happen?

39:38.248 --> 39:40.451
It's just down here.

39:44.222 --> 39:46.158
- Hi.
- Hi, Marina.

39:52.163 --> 39:53.996
- Donna. Hi.
- Hi.

39:53.998 --> 39:56.065
- Hi, Emy.
- Marina.

39:56.067 --> 39:59.434
- Hi, Marina. Good to see you.
- You OK? Nice to see you.

39:59.436 --> 40:03.338
This is Mrs Justice Maye. Very
high up. Here to see young Adam.

40:03.340 --> 40:04.539
- Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.

40:04.541 --> 40:06.144
Hi.

40:10.248 --> 40:13.883
I'll let him know
you're coming, My Lady.

40:13.885 --> 40:17.619
He's made up his mind,
like living for his principles.

40:17.621 --> 40:19.257
Dying, you mean.

40:29.300 --> 40:32.001
Brilliant. I was right.

40:32.003 --> 40:35.237
The judge has come to see me.
I knew it.

40:35.239 --> 40:37.273
What do they call you?

40:37.275 --> 40:40.008
Your Highness? Your Excellency?
Your Honourable something?

40:40.010 --> 40:42.244
In court it's "My Lady".

40:42.246 --> 40:47.383
My Lady. Oh, that's fantastic.

40:47.385 --> 40:50.219
- Am I allowed to call you that?
- My name's Fiona Maye.

40:50.221 --> 40:51.920
No, but I wanna call you...

40:51.922 --> 40:53.289
I wanna call you My Lady,
please.

40:53.291 --> 40:55.827
Do you want
to catch your breath?

41:00.530 --> 41:02.366
My Lady.

41:04.635 --> 41:07.302
You know, I told Marina,
and Donna, the sister,

41:07.304 --> 41:10.373
and Jake, the dinner guy, and
all the doctors that you'd come.

41:10.375 --> 41:12.041
And they all said, 'No, no,

41:12.043 --> 41:13.943
judges don't do
that sort of thing.'

41:13.945 --> 41:16.512
- But I knew.
- Well, there you go.

41:16.514 --> 41:19.581
Underneath their clothes,
people are sheep.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.386
So you've come
to change my mind.

41:24.021 --> 41:25.588
Straighten me out.

41:25.590 --> 41:28.557
No, Adam. I need to know
what's best for you.

41:28.559 --> 41:32.662
Please, miss, set me on the path
of righteousness.

41:32.664 --> 41:37.300
I have to be sure
you know what you're doing.

41:37.302 --> 41:40.670
Leukaemia's
a very serious illness.

41:40.672 --> 41:45.307
Refusing a blood transfusion
when it could save your life,

41:45.309 --> 41:47.443
some people think
you've been unduly influenced

41:47.445 --> 41:50.012
by your parents and the elders,

41:50.014 --> 41:52.347
and others think
that you're awfully clever

41:52.349 --> 41:55.650
and we should just let you
get on with it.

41:55.652 --> 42:01.423
Should we?
Let you do yourself in?

42:01.425 --> 42:04.360
Somehow I've got to decide.

42:04.362 --> 42:06.528
I think it's my choice.

42:06.530 --> 42:08.563
I'm afraid
the law doesn't agree.

42:08.565 --> 42:11.002
The law is an ass.

42:12.670 --> 42:16.037
So they say.

42:16.039 --> 42:19.742
But let's just consider
the practicalities.

42:19.744 --> 42:22.010
With a transfusion,

42:22.012 --> 42:25.514
the consultant could add
two drugs to your treatment

42:25.516 --> 42:29.584
and you'd stand a good chance
of a pretty quick recovery.

42:29.586 --> 42:32.153
Without a transfusion,
you could die.

42:32.155 --> 42:34.358
- You understand that?
- Yeah.

42:38.061 --> 42:42.063
But how about this, Adam?
Partial recovery.

42:42.065 --> 42:45.501
You could lose your sight,
suffer brain damage.

42:45.503 --> 42:47.673
Your kidneys could go.

42:49.407 --> 42:51.307
Is that going to please God?

42:51.309 --> 42:53.376
If you don't believe in God,

42:53.378 --> 42:56.512
you've no right talking about
what does or doesn't please him.

42:56.514 --> 42:59.648
I haven't said I don't believe.

42:59.650 --> 43:02.418
I need to know
you've thought this through.

43:02.420 --> 43:07.456
Blind or mentally disabled,
or both.

43:07.458 --> 43:11.563
For the rest of your life.
Ready for that?

43:19.771 --> 43:22.140
I'd hate it.

43:22.706 --> 43:25.109
I'd hate it.

43:32.717 --> 43:34.682
But I'd accept it.

43:37.688 --> 43:39.324
Wait.

43:44.461 --> 43:46.461
Excuse me.

44:00.478 --> 44:05.182
Now, you listen closely
to this lady.

44:13.824 --> 44:16.291
Hey, Adam. Roast chicken, man.

44:16.293 --> 44:18.029
Out.

44:29.739 --> 44:32.076
Go away.

44:37.148 --> 44:39.584
Do you have children, My Lady?

44:40.585 --> 44:42.788
No, sadly. I wish...

44:44.121 --> 44:46.454
Always too busy.

44:46.456 --> 44:48.824
The law can take over your life.

44:48.826 --> 44:50.693
Perhaps you will.

44:50.695 --> 44:52.827
- I don't think so.
- Sorry. I didn't mean...

44:52.829 --> 44:54.762
Tell me this, Adam.

44:54.764 --> 44:57.733
I want to hear it
in your own words.

44:57.735 --> 45:00.702
Why won't you have
a blood transfusion?

45:00.704 --> 45:03.204
'Cause it's wrong.

45:03.206 --> 45:04.706
Go on.

45:04.708 --> 45:07.142
God has told us that it's wrong.

45:07.144 --> 45:08.610
Why is it wrong?

45:08.612 --> 45:11.447
Why is anything wrong, My Lady?

45:11.449 --> 45:13.648
We just know it.

45:13.650 --> 45:19.690
Murder, torture, lying, being
unfaithful in your marriage.

45:20.891 --> 45:23.726
How do we just know it?

45:23.728 --> 45:28.264
It's in our hearts.
God has put it there.

45:28.266 --> 45:33.334
And so... like, even if
we get useful information

45:33.336 --> 45:35.470
by torturing a terrorist,

45:35.472 --> 45:39.474
we know,
we just know it's wrong.

45:39.476 --> 45:41.943
Is transfusion like torture?

45:41.945 --> 45:44.213
They're both wrong.

45:44.215 --> 45:45.847
I wish I could
make you see this.

45:45.849 --> 45:48.284
Blood isn't just
a biological thing

45:48.286 --> 45:50.355
and it isn't just a symbol.

45:53.224 --> 45:55.460
It's life itself.

45:57.327 --> 45:59.530
It's what we are.

46:00.697 --> 46:02.664
We've chosen to live
in God's truth

46:02.666 --> 46:06.267
and he's told us not to mix
our blood with other people's.

46:06.269 --> 46:09.671
It's a simple rule
we wanna live by.

46:09.673 --> 46:13.208
We're not inflicting it
on anyone else.

46:13.210 --> 46:17.181
We just wanna live our lives
in the truth as we see it.

46:19.349 --> 46:21.519
As we know it.

46:25.655 --> 46:29.458
Thank you, Adam.

46:29.460 --> 46:33.329
And if I decided the hospital
can legally transfuse you,

46:33.331 --> 46:34.362
what would you think?

46:34.364 --> 46:35.530
I'd think My Lady

46:35.532 --> 46:37.268
was an interfering busybody.

46:53.918 --> 46:56.288
No, don't go yet, please.

46:57.387 --> 46:59.521
Adam, I have to be in court.

46:59.523 --> 47:01.626
Just wait till Donna
brings my supper.

47:04.327 --> 47:07.929
Alright, before I go, will you
tell me about your guitar?

47:07.931 --> 47:10.566
It's beautiful.

47:10.568 --> 47:12.635
It belonged to my grandad.

47:12.637 --> 47:15.740
It looks really lived-in.
Lovely.

47:18.742 --> 47:21.043
- You know something?
- What?

47:21.045 --> 47:22.543
I've been playing four weeks

47:22.545 --> 47:24.545
and I can already play
ten tunes.

47:24.547 --> 47:27.585
And this is the hardest so far.

47:35.760 --> 47:39.898
No, it's a C. There.

47:41.032 --> 47:42.800
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm.

47:52.510 --> 47:54.446
That's it.

47:56.347 --> 48:01.516
<i>♪ And on my leaning shoulder</i>

48:01.518 --> 48:07.789
<i>♪ She laid her snow-white hand</i>

48:07.791 --> 48:13.429
<i>♪ She bid me take life easy</i>

48:13.431 --> 48:19.034
<i>♪ As the grass grows
on the weirs</i>

48:19.036 --> 48:24.740
<i>♪ But I was young and foolish</i>

48:24.742 --> 48:30.979
<i>♪ And now am full of tears ♪</i>

48:30.981 --> 48:33.382
Pretty good, only four weeks.

48:33.384 --> 48:34.916
I never even knew it had words.

48:34.918 --> 48:38.454
It's Yeats, a very famous poet
and a lovely poem.

48:38.456 --> 48:40.856
I love "and on my leaning
shoulder".

48:40.858 --> 48:42.891
Let's do the whole thing.

48:42.893 --> 48:46.494
It's dinnertime for you
and I have to be in court.

48:46.496 --> 48:49.933
My Lady, please...
stay a bit longer.

48:51.402 --> 48:53.769
"She bid me take life easy."

48:53.771 --> 48:56.675
Well, then,
can I have your email?

49:00.043 --> 49:01.478
Goodbye, Adam.

49:04.514 --> 49:07.449
Are you coming back?

49:07.451 --> 49:11.052
I am bound
by the Children Act

49:11.054 --> 49:15.791
and the clear injunction
of its opening lines:

49:15.793 --> 49:17.525
"The child's welfare

49:17.527 --> 49:20.831
shall be the court's
paramount consideration."

49:23.666 --> 49:26.068
Assuming a good recovery,

49:26.070 --> 49:29.704
this young man's welfare
is better served

49:29.706 --> 49:31.606
by his love of reading

49:31.608 --> 49:35.010
and his newly found passion
for the guitar,

49:35.012 --> 49:38.579
by the exercise
of his lively intelligence

49:38.581 --> 49:43.619
and by the expression of
a playful, affectionate nature

49:43.621 --> 49:49.657
and by all of life and love
that lie ahead of him.

49:49.659 --> 49:51.927
I find that A himself,

49:51.929 --> 49:55.430
his parents
and the elders of his church

49:55.432 --> 50:01.537
have made a decision
which is hostile to A's welfare.

50:01.539 --> 50:07.708
He must be protected from
his religion and from himself.

50:07.710 --> 50:09.711
In my judgement,

50:09.713 --> 50:13.752
his life is more precious
than his dignity.

50:15.952 --> 50:19.153
My direction and declaration
are as follows.

50:19.155 --> 50:22.057
It will be lawful
for the applicant hospital

50:22.059 --> 50:24.525
to pursue
such medical treatments of A

50:24.527 --> 50:26.994
as they deem necessary,

50:26.996 --> 50:29.500
including blood transfusion.

52:26.684 --> 52:28.920
End of the affair?

52:30.721 --> 52:32.222
Maybe.

53:01.751 --> 53:05.987
Look, the only important thing
is that I love you.

53:05.989 --> 53:09.224
- You fucked her.
- Yes.

53:09.226 --> 53:12.661
But if it was a stupid mistake,
then so is this, because...

53:12.663 --> 53:14.729
If you're staying,
then sleep in the spare room.

53:14.731 --> 53:16.632
Hey, come on,
we can't avoid this any longer.

53:16.634 --> 53:18.967
Our only option is to talk.

53:18.969 --> 53:21.172
Excuse me. Long day.

53:34.985 --> 53:37.284
- Uncle Jack!
- Hi, guys!

53:37.286 --> 53:39.121
I'll collect them tomorrow
around ten.

53:39.123 --> 53:40.789
- Yes, perfect.
- Thanks for this.

53:40.791 --> 53:42.090
- Bye, girls. Be good.
- Bye!

53:42.092 --> 53:44.059
Sally, Maisie,
you ready for some fun?

53:44.061 --> 53:45.927
Yeah!

53:45.929 --> 53:47.365
Let's go.

53:48.431 --> 53:50.132
I love...

53:50.134 --> 53:52.767
I love how she just
clings to you all the time.

53:52.769 --> 53:55.704
- Look. She does.
- Got you!

53:55.706 --> 53:59.007
Suppose...
Suppose she had to get you.

53:59.009 --> 54:01.980
Would you still go after her?
Yeah, you would?

54:03.179 --> 54:05.315
Alright, try to get me.

54:07.451 --> 54:09.284
<i>Hello?</i>

54:09.286 --> 54:12.354
- Hello, Michael. Fiona Maye.
- <i>Fiona?</i>

54:12.356 --> 54:14.322
You got my message?

54:14.324 --> 54:16.791
No, I meant it.

54:16.793 --> 54:19.860
I need a solicitor. Yeah.

54:19.862 --> 54:22.197
<i>"The following morning,
ten-year-old Peter Fortune</i>

54:22.199 --> 54:24.365
woke from troubled dreams

54:24.367 --> 54:31.873
to find himself transformed
into a giant person, an adult."

54:31.875 --> 54:34.309
- "He tried to move his arms..."
- Uncle Jack.

54:34.311 --> 54:36.981
Why are you sleeping
in the sitting room?

54:38.215 --> 54:39.880
- Well...
- 'Cause he snores.

54:39.882 --> 54:41.349
Auntie Fi throws him out.

54:41.351 --> 54:43.385
- Our daddy snores.
- Course he does.

54:43.387 --> 54:46.420
They're brothers, stupid.

54:46.422 --> 54:49.057
Yeah, I'm a bad snorer.

54:49.059 --> 54:52.461
"He had eaten too much as well,
because his stomach felt tight,

54:52.463 --> 54:56.798
and he had been talking too much
because his throat was sore."

54:56.800 --> 55:00.267
OK, we're gonna stop there and
I'm gonna turn out this light,

55:00.269 --> 55:03.170
but I'll leave the night light
on, alright, girls?

55:03.172 --> 55:05.106
No jumping on the bed, OK,

55:05.108 --> 55:07.775
and maybe you'll both
wake up to be giants,

55:07.777 --> 55:09.244
just like Peter Fortune.

55:09.246 --> 55:10.778
Night-night.

55:10.780 --> 55:12.784
Night-night, Uncle Jack.

55:19.123 --> 55:21.325
- Shall we talk?
- No.

55:47.351 --> 55:49.150
<i>You've reached
Fiona Maye's phone.</i>

55:49.152 --> 55:50.918
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

55:50.920 --> 55:53.988
Hi. This is Adam Henry.

55:53.990 --> 55:58.360
My Lady, I got your number.
It wasn't difficult.

55:58.362 --> 56:00.295
I'm out of hospital at last,

56:00.297 --> 56:03.831
and it's so great
to hear your calm voice.

56:03.833 --> 56:05.300
I loved it
when you came and sat with me

56:05.302 --> 56:08.302
and we did the <i>Salley Gardens.</i>

56:08.304 --> 56:11.940
I look at that poem every day.

56:11.942 --> 56:14.846
I suppose I like being
'young and foolish'.

56:16.547 --> 56:21.184
But if it wasn't for you,
I'd be neither. I'd be dead.

56:46.275 --> 56:50.010
<i>My Lady, it's me again,
Adam Henry.</i>

56:50.012 --> 56:53.081
<i>I'm having these wonderful,
impossible daydreams,</i>

56:53.083 --> 56:54.916
really stupid, like...

56:54.918 --> 56:57.184
we go round the world
in an oil tanker

56:57.186 --> 56:59.287
and we have cabins
next door to each other,

56:59.289 --> 57:03.057
<i>walk up and down the decks
talking all day.</i>

57:03.059 --> 57:05.459
<i>Oh, and guess what?
I'm reading Yeats.</i>

57:05.461 --> 57:08.329
His doctorate's in good shape
and he'll defend it well.

57:08.331 --> 57:11.298
The problem is Tony.
He'll be at the meeting, yeah.

57:11.300 --> 57:14.137
I might be ten minutes late,
so start without me.

57:27.284 --> 57:30.584
<i>My Lady, it's me again,
Adam Henry.</i>

57:30.586 --> 57:35.257
<i>I'm having these wonderful,
impossible daydreams.</i>

57:35.259 --> 57:38.959
Poor kid. He's lost Jehovah
and he's found you.

57:38.961 --> 57:40.327
Drop him a note, for God's sake.

57:40.329 --> 57:42.599
I can't go encouraging...

57:43.567 --> 57:45.633
It's simply not professional.

57:45.635 --> 57:48.072
No, no, no, of course not.

57:52.576 --> 57:54.911
Alright, I'm...

57:56.313 --> 57:57.882
I'm frightened.

58:01.451 --> 58:03.588
Of... Of myself.

58:09.126 --> 58:12.126
Assuming they want it,
what about an encore?

58:12.128 --> 58:15.229
A few Christmases ago,
we did <i>My Funny Valentine</i>

58:15.231 --> 58:17.367
and I forgot the words.

58:20.070 --> 58:21.572
Right.

58:37.286 --> 58:41.125
<i>♪ My funny valentine</i>

58:42.492 --> 58:47.431
<i>♪ Sweet comic valentine...</i>

59:29.706 --> 59:31.572
Well, well. A stalker.

59:31.574 --> 59:35.043
It's nothing sinister, honestly.
I... I don't mean to harass you.

59:35.045 --> 59:39.179
I'm... I'm just... I thought
you wouldn't recognise me.

59:39.181 --> 59:43.351
- How did you get my number?
- It's not difficult.

59:43.353 --> 59:47.088
I feel the top of my head
has sort of exploded

59:47.090 --> 59:48.655
and all sorts of things
are coming out,

59:48.657 --> 59:50.691
and so I just wanted
to give you these.

59:50.693 --> 59:54.362
- Adam, look, I can't.
- Please, My Lady, please.

59:54.364 --> 59:56.630
It's just poems
I've been writing

59:56.632 --> 01:00:00.603
and letters I never posted
and... thoughts about...

01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:05.009
about things.

01:00:10.447 --> 01:00:14.382
You look a lot stronger.
How's it been?

01:00:14.384 --> 01:00:16.818
Lots of rows with my parents.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.653
School's OK, I suppose.

01:00:19.655 --> 01:00:22.423
Sometimes the idea of having
a stranger's blood inside me

01:00:22.425 --> 01:00:29.329
makes me feel sick, like...
drinking someone else's saliva.

01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:31.099
Come on. You're alive.

01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:34.702
Yeah, but I wanted...
Look, I've so many questions.

01:00:34.704 --> 01:00:36.271
Couldn't we go somewhere
and talk?

01:00:36.273 --> 01:00:37.771
Adam, there's something
I want you

01:00:37.773 --> 01:00:40.240
to get very clear
in your mind.

01:00:40.242 --> 01:00:42.209
For me, your case is over.

01:00:42.211 --> 01:00:43.677
I've got lots of new cases,

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:46.481
babies and children,
all kinds of sadness,

01:00:46.483 --> 01:00:49.450
and for you,
you've got your life back.

01:00:49.452 --> 01:00:51.653
Everything's ahead of you now.

01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:54.322
You're talented. You're going to
do very well, I'm sure of that.

01:00:54.324 --> 01:00:57.124
But there's one thing
I want you to do for me.

01:00:57.126 --> 01:00:59.193
Don't phone me again
or write to me or follow me.

01:00:59.195 --> 01:01:02.329
Do you understand? Your future's
out there waiting for you.

01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:04.264
- And you're going to have fun.
- No, but, My Lady...

01:01:04.266 --> 01:01:07.137
No, that's it.
I'm gonna watch you walk away.

01:02:16.539 --> 01:02:18.572
You were seen coming out
of Mike Morrow's office.

01:02:18.574 --> 01:02:23.378
Divorce? Are you serious?
Without even telling me?

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:28.483
I hope he pointed out that
you might just be overreacting.

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:30.918
Perhaps it's time
I started overreacting.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.755
God. You're the big authority
on family problems,

01:02:34.757 --> 01:02:36.257
and yet when it comes
to your own,

01:02:36.259 --> 01:02:38.193
you're like a sulking child.

01:02:38.195 --> 01:02:40.360
You were ready to buy your
pleasures with my unhappiness.

01:02:40.362 --> 01:02:43.831
- That was a discovery.
- Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:46.233
This is beyond self-pity.

01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:49.470
What is the point
of your silence, Fiona?

01:02:49.472 --> 01:02:51.572
What is the point?

01:02:51.574 --> 01:02:54.374
Come on, wake up.

01:02:54.376 --> 01:02:56.547
I don't trust you any more.

01:02:58.248 --> 01:03:02.983
Listen, I left this marriage
for two days. Two days.

01:03:02.985 --> 01:03:05.755
You left it years ago.

01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:11.793
You might just think about that
while you're away.

01:03:51.735 --> 01:03:53.735
Right, this is the last of it
and now I'm off.

01:03:53.737 --> 01:03:56.704
Tickets are in the blue folder
and I'll see you in Newcastle,

01:03:56.706 --> 01:03:58.606
the first stop
on our old northern circuit.

01:03:58.608 --> 01:04:00.907
Your favourite city,
I seem to remember.

01:04:00.909 --> 01:04:03.478
Yeah, beautiful.
I had cousins there.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.749
It's the only place
I was ever wild and free.

01:04:07.751 --> 01:04:10.287
Have you ever been
wild and free, Nigel?

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:16.324
No, never. Thank God.

01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:18.494
I'd be hopeless at it.

01:05:07.476 --> 01:05:12.412
<i>My Lady, I've got
so many questions for you.</i>

01:05:12.414 --> 01:05:14.585
<i>Why is Yeats such a great poet?</i>

01:05:15.652 --> 01:05:17.688
<i>We just know, but how?</i>

01:05:19.655 --> 01:05:21.789
<i>What is beauty in a poem?</i>

01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:24.458
<i>It's more than
just lovely sounds,</i>

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.128
<i>and it has to be saying
something that's true.</i>

01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:32.032
<i>Why has our wonderful song
got two sharps?</i>

01:05:32.034 --> 01:05:34.837
<i>I don't understand
about sharps and flats.</i>

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:40.777
<i>My Lady, you never told me
what you believed in.</i>

01:05:42.144 --> 01:05:44.581
<i>I bet it isn't God.</i>

01:05:45.447 --> 01:05:46.817
<i>But what?</i>

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.818
<i>And me?</i>

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.490
<i>I just don't know any more.</i>

01:05:59.795 --> 01:06:02.597
<i>Sometimes, in strange moods,
I think,</i>

01:06:02.599 --> 01:06:04.932
<i>well, I'm an adult now.</i>

01:06:04.934 --> 01:06:08.403
<i>This thing will come back.
I just know it will.</i>

01:06:08.405 --> 01:06:09.840
<i>And then...</i>

01:06:16.179 --> 01:06:19.179
<i>We will soon
be arriving at Newcastle.</i>

01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:20.981
<i>Customers should ensure
that they take</i>

01:06:20.983 --> 01:06:23.050
<i>all of their personal
belongings with them.</i>

01:06:23.052 --> 01:06:24.651
<i>Thank you for your custom.</i>

01:06:24.653 --> 01:06:26.153
<i>We look forward
to seeing you again</i>

01:06:26.155 --> 01:06:28.057
<i>in the future.</i>

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.608
- Thank you.
- Hello.

01:06:47.143 --> 01:06:50.744
So I've listed a care case
for two days. Mother inadequate.

01:06:50.746 --> 01:06:53.648
Two children in separate foster
placements hoping for adoption.

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:55.916
- Right.
- My dear Fiona.

01:06:55.918 --> 01:06:58.820
- Welcome to Newcastle.
- Thank you.

01:06:58.822 --> 01:07:01.555
Meet the High Sheriff,
John Baker.

01:07:01.557 --> 01:07:03.758
We'll be joining you for dinner
tonight at the lodgings.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.793
I'm afraid you'll find they've
gone downhill a bit. Cuts.

01:07:06.795 --> 01:07:08.996
John would like
to join you tomorrow

01:07:08.998 --> 01:07:10.965
if you have
anything interesting.

01:07:10.967 --> 01:07:12.133
Well, do join me.

01:07:12.135 --> 01:07:13.200
I'm afraid all I can promise you

01:07:13.202 --> 01:07:15.639
is two neglected children.

01:07:33.655 --> 01:07:35.425
Thank you.

01:07:39.695 --> 01:07:41.831
No, no. I'll take them.

01:08:05.889 --> 01:08:08.492
- Fiona.
- Caradoc.

01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:12.025
You didn't invite anyone
for tonight?

01:08:12.027 --> 01:08:14.996
No. Clean forgot.

01:08:14.998 --> 01:08:16.630
Jolly good.

01:08:16.631 --> 01:08:20.837
Well, let me introduce you
to my lot.

01:08:22.005 --> 01:08:24.604
- John Baker, you've met.
- Yes.

01:08:24.606 --> 01:08:27.140
Paul Rotman has
a fibre optics business here.

01:08:27.143 --> 01:08:30.277
James MacLeish. What do we
call you, Jim? A mandarin?

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.312
Up here
for coastline conservation.

01:08:32.314 --> 01:08:34.048
Mrs Justice Fiona Maye.

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.750
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

01:08:35.752 --> 01:08:39.152
I'll have the same as everyone.
Cheers.

01:08:39.154 --> 01:08:41.688
- To your very good health.
- Slainte.

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:44.157
Rather than spending
millions on coastal defences,

01:08:44.158 --> 01:08:46.059
we could let the sea
flood the fields,

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:49.196
let them revert to salt marshes,
compensate the farmers.

01:08:49.198 --> 01:08:51.765
But the channel through which
or the conduit

01:08:51.768 --> 01:08:55.736
through which they can come
to some agreement...

01:08:55.738 --> 01:08:57.604
Oh.

01:08:57.606 --> 01:09:01.975
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Something seems to have come up.

01:09:01.978 --> 01:09:03.712
Oh.

01:09:09.786 --> 01:09:12.687
I'm frozen. Could we please
get some heating into that room?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.688
- Of course, My Lady.
- Thank you.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:16.823
My Lady, I think
you'd better come and see.

01:09:16.826 --> 01:09:19.029
It's just this way.

01:09:28.738 --> 01:09:31.906
This is
the Jehovah's Witness boy.

01:09:31.908 --> 01:09:34.611
You remember,
from the transfusion case.

01:09:36.377 --> 01:09:38.046
Oh, yes.

01:09:40.182 --> 01:09:42.116
It seems
that he followed you here.

01:09:42.118 --> 01:09:43.984
They wanted to turn him away,
but I...

01:09:43.987 --> 01:09:46.120
Thank you.
I'll deal with it now.

01:09:46.122 --> 01:09:49.122
We'd better have
that heater in here.

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.295
Yes, My Lady.

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:57.365
I'm really, really sorry.

01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:59.634
So here we are again.

01:09:59.636 --> 01:10:03.370
- How did you find me here?
- Internet mostly.

01:10:03.372 --> 01:10:06.641
Followed you to King's Cross
and got...

01:10:06.643 --> 01:10:08.009
Look, I'm so sorry, My Lady.

01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:09.977
Do your parents know
where you are?

01:10:09.979 --> 01:10:12.379
- I'm 18 now. I can be...
- I don't care how old you are.

01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:14.850
They'll be worried about you.

01:10:17.854 --> 01:10:22.055
Uh, right, now, I know
there's a socket somewhere.

01:10:22.057 --> 01:10:23.857
- I can hardly see a thing.
- Sit down.

01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:26.128
Ah, right. Uh...

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:37.405
- Right.
- Thank you.

01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:40.877
Um, I'll be...
I'll be right outside.

01:10:47.984 --> 01:10:50.317
So...

01:10:50.319 --> 01:10:53.821
I had another row
with my dad last night.

01:10:53.823 --> 01:10:55.959
Biggest so far.

01:10:58.094 --> 01:11:03.697
And then I walked out,
just left.

01:11:03.699 --> 01:11:06.366
But I texted my mum last night
saying I was alright and...

01:11:06.368 --> 01:11:07.968
Do it again now. Write to her.

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:09.236
Tell her
you're safe in Newcastle

01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:10.403
and you'll write again tomorrow.

01:11:10.405 --> 01:11:11.438
And then we'll talk.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.873
But it's completely...

01:11:12.875 --> 01:11:15.078
Do it. Come on.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.062
Should I be frightened?
Are you really stalking me?

01:11:35.064 --> 01:11:39.299
No, it's nothing like that.
I read your judgement.

01:11:39.301 --> 01:11:43.504
You said you wanted to save me
from my religion, from myself.

01:11:43.506 --> 01:11:47.244
Well, you did. I'm saved.

01:11:48.978 --> 01:11:51.681
What do you want?

01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:57.117
I'm not the person I was.

01:11:57.119 --> 01:12:00.390
When you came to see me,
I really was ready to die.

01:12:02.457 --> 01:12:05.526
Amazing that someone like you
could waste your time on me.

01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:08.129
I was such an idiot.

01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:12.232
- You seemed very sincere.
- Well, a sincere idiot.

01:12:12.234 --> 01:12:16.102
I felt so noble telling
the doctors to leave me alone.

01:12:16.104 --> 01:12:18.472
No one could understand
how profound I was.

01:12:18.474 --> 01:12:21.378
I was so pumped up.

01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:24.978
At night I used to think
about this video

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.513
I was gonna make on my phone,

01:12:26.515 --> 01:12:29.950
like suicide bombers do.

01:12:29.952 --> 01:12:32.553
It was gonna be on the TV news.

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:36.022
I could make myself cry
just thinking about my funeral,

01:12:36.024 --> 01:12:39.860
everyone loving me,
everyone weeping.

01:12:39.862 --> 01:12:42.231
What a sacrifice he made.

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.266
What an idiot.

01:12:45.268 --> 01:12:47.770
Where was God?

01:12:48.837 --> 01:12:53.040
He was there, behind everything.

01:12:53.042 --> 01:12:57.881
I was obeying his word,
living in the truth.

01:12:59.381 --> 01:13:01.281
But it wasn't only about him.

01:13:01.283 --> 01:13:05.119
It was my delicious adventure,
my beautiful death...

01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:07.220
More of an adolescent thing.

01:13:07.222 --> 01:13:08.923
But if I hadn't been a Witness,

01:13:08.925 --> 01:13:10.991
I would never have been
in that mess.

01:13:10.993 --> 01:13:15.528
- So now you've lost your faith?
- No, no. Perhaps.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:17.831
It scares me to say it out loud,
but the thing is,

01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:19.567
once you take a step back
from the Witnesses,

01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:21.302
you might as well
go all the way.

01:13:21.304 --> 01:13:24.370
Why replace one tooth fairy
with another?

01:13:24.372 --> 01:13:27.340
Top of your head has exploded.

01:13:33.448 --> 01:13:36.317
I can play a piece by Bach.

01:13:36.319 --> 01:13:38.421
I've read all of Yeats.

01:13:39.154 --> 01:13:41.187
I'm in a play.

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:45.425
"All of life and love
that lie ahead of me."

01:13:45.427 --> 01:13:48.128
- That's what you wrote.
- Yes, Adam.

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:51.467
I'm asking you again,
what do you want?

01:13:54.569 --> 01:13:56.269
To thank you.

01:13:56.271 --> 01:13:58.908
There are easier ways.

01:14:03.145 --> 01:14:05.879
When you visited me
at the hospital,

01:14:05.881 --> 01:14:09.049
that was one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

01:14:09.051 --> 01:14:13.620
It's this way you have of...
of listening, of thinking.

01:14:13.622 --> 01:14:15.958
I watched you thinking.

01:14:17.126 --> 01:14:19.362
Why are you here?

01:14:22.564 --> 01:14:25.501
When you hear it,
you'll think it's so stupid.

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:31.474
But, please,
say you'll think about it.

01:14:35.645 --> 01:14:37.514
Well?

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:45.287
I want to come
and live with you.

01:14:49.425 --> 01:14:52.326
I could do odd jobs,
housework, anything.

01:14:52.328 --> 01:14:53.994
You could give me reading lists,

01:14:53.996 --> 01:14:56.330
everything you think
I should know about.

01:14:56.332 --> 01:14:58.197
And I wouldn't get in the way,

01:14:58.199 --> 01:15:00.099
with you and your husband,
I mean.

01:15:00.101 --> 01:15:01.968
I could be like a lodger.

01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:03.539
I'd get a job,
pay you some rent.

01:15:18.954 --> 01:15:21.190
Wait here.

01:15:45.514 --> 01:15:47.647
Your taxi will be here
in five minutes.

01:15:47.649 --> 01:15:50.152
No, no, you can't.

01:15:55.423 --> 01:15:59.492
When I had the blood,
my parents were there.

01:15:59.494 --> 01:16:04.099
I saw them hugging each other
and crying, really sobbing.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.303
They'd lost the case
and they'd tried so hard.

01:16:09.305 --> 01:16:13.473
But then I realised, no, no,
they were crying for joy,

01:16:13.475 --> 01:16:15.675
'cause they'd always
wanted me to live

01:16:15.677 --> 01:16:18.211
and they'd never told me.

01:16:18.213 --> 01:16:19.646
It wasn't about God at all.

01:16:19.648 --> 01:16:25.218
I felt cheated,
like I'd been really stupid.

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.423
The whole thing was a fraud.

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:31.759
And I've looked it up.

01:16:31.761 --> 01:16:35.696
The courts always let
the hospital transfuse a minor.

01:16:35.698 --> 01:16:37.563
You knew that.

01:16:37.565 --> 01:16:39.633
You always knew
what you were gonna do.

01:16:39.635 --> 01:16:42.436
They'd never let a kid die
for their parents' religion.

01:16:42.438 --> 01:16:47.074
So what were you doing
at my bedside,

01:16:47.076 --> 01:16:52.178
coming bothering me
and singing with me,

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.647
getting under my skin,
trying to get close to me,

01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:57.418
asking me questions?

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.785
I didn't ask you into my life.

01:16:58.787 --> 01:17:01.054
A rubber stamp,
that's all you needed.

01:17:01.056 --> 01:17:04.058
You can't just send me away.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.326
I don't care if you think
you're too grand

01:17:06.328 --> 01:17:07.628
to explain yourself,

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:10.065
'cause I've a right to know.

01:17:11.199 --> 01:17:13.435
What did you want from me?

01:17:15.738 --> 01:17:18.441
And my parents,
if they loved me...

01:17:19.675 --> 01:17:21.308
It's here.

01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:23.079
Thank you.

01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:33.187
My clerk will take you to
the station and buy your ticket

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:35.458
and put you on the train
to London.

01:17:48.671 --> 01:17:50.507
To the station.

01:17:54.877 --> 01:17:58.211
If you loved your son,
your only son,

01:17:58.213 --> 01:18:00.449
why would you let him die?

01:18:02.618 --> 01:18:04.387
I'm sorry.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.096
Let's be off, then.

01:18:29.345 --> 01:18:30.847
Goodbye, Adam.

01:19:06.814 --> 01:19:11.684
I, Christine Samantha Delancy,
do swear by Almighty God

01:19:11.686 --> 01:19:13.653
that I will well and truly serve

01:19:13.655 --> 01:19:17.391
our Sovereign Lady
Queen Elizabeth II

01:19:17.393 --> 01:19:19.593
and I will do right
to all manner of people

01:19:19.595 --> 01:19:22.963
after the laws and usages
of this realm,

01:19:22.965 --> 01:19:27.403
without fear or favour,
affection or ill will.

01:19:44.353 --> 01:19:47.553
Son, I found your Bible
in the hall

01:19:47.555 --> 01:19:49.388
and all these pamphlets.

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:51.458
Mum, I don't want any of it
in my room.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.894
You're not dressed yet, darling.
Your father's waiting.

01:19:54.896 --> 01:19:56.629
Come on.
We're gonna be late. Let's go.

01:19:56.631 --> 01:19:58.565
You go ahead. I'm staying here.

01:19:58.567 --> 01:20:00.968
He doesn't wanna keep his Bible
in his room.

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:03.236
- What's up, Adam?
- Nothing's up.

01:20:03.238 --> 01:20:05.504
So, get your suit and tie on.
Let's go.

01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:07.674
I've just told you,
I'm staying here.

01:20:07.676 --> 01:20:10.509
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

01:20:10.511 --> 01:20:12.646
- What's the matter?
- Problems with your breathing?

01:20:12.648 --> 01:20:14.848
I'm fine.

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:18.384
- So what's the problem?
- It's simple.

01:20:18.386 --> 01:20:21.588
You're going to Kingdom Hall.
I'm never going again.

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:24.594
You wanted me to die.
Well, a part of me has.

01:21:23.085 --> 01:21:24.985
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

01:21:24.987 --> 01:21:27.523
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

01:21:33.028 --> 01:21:35.465
I'm not giving up.

01:21:53.948 --> 01:21:55.717
Thank you.

01:21:57.019 --> 01:21:59.521
- Evening, Jim.
- Evening, My Lady.

01:22:06.494 --> 01:22:08.995
- Hello, Fiona. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

01:22:08.997 --> 01:22:11.630
Jack Maye, just the man. We need
a Latin motto for a free school.

01:22:11.632 --> 01:22:14.134
- I'll get us some drinks.
- "Every child a genius."

01:22:14.136 --> 01:22:16.035
Can you do that?
Complete lie, of course.

01:22:16.037 --> 01:22:17.803
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

01:22:17.805 --> 01:22:19.406
You've just got to listen
to this.

01:22:19.408 --> 01:22:21.007
The Mountjoy charge sheet.

01:22:21.009 --> 01:22:24.844
Procuring cocaine,
dangerous driving, whores...

01:22:24.846 --> 01:22:26.780
- You mean sex workers.
- Cross-dressing.

01:22:26.782 --> 01:22:29.849
- What more could you want?
- Blasphemy?

01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:32.052
Fiona, I'd like you to meet
Toby Marlowe.

01:22:32.054 --> 01:22:33.719
- Yes, oh, hello.
- Brilliant barrister.

01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:35.655
- Absolutely brilliant.
- Right.

01:22:35.657 --> 01:22:39.092
- My nephew, actually.
- Super. What's your field?

01:22:39.094 --> 01:22:41.160
- Crim...
- Criminal law?

01:22:41.162 --> 01:22:43.496
- Yes, I'm...
- Good.

01:22:43.498 --> 01:22:45.464
- Excellent. Good luck.
- My Lady, we need you.

01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:46.866
- Yes.
- We need justice.

01:22:46.868 --> 01:22:48.535
The men are getting
all the work.

01:22:48.537 --> 01:22:50.169
We're starving to death,
actually.

01:22:50.171 --> 01:22:53.973
And men are useless.
It's a scientific fact.

01:22:53.975 --> 01:22:57.679
I heard that.
Keep it under your hat.

01:23:36.484 --> 01:23:37.819
Um, Fiona.

01:23:40.087 --> 01:23:41.955
Really?

01:23:41.957 --> 01:23:44.558
Masters of Bench
and guests,

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.893
the Christmas Miscellany
is about to begin.

01:23:47.895 --> 01:23:51.197
<i>My Lady, I just had
word the Jehovah's Witness boy,</i>

01:23:51.199 --> 01:23:53.500
<i>Adam Henry, is very ill again.</i>

01:23:53.502 --> 01:23:55.101
<i>He's in St David's Hospice,</i>

01:23:55.103 --> 01:23:58.671
<i>refusing treatment,
refusing to see his parents.</i>

01:23:58.673 --> 01:24:01.109
<i>They think he might not
survive the night.</i>

01:24:16.024 --> 01:24:19.659
You OK? Where's your music?

01:24:19.661 --> 01:24:20.960
- Look, take this.
- Oh, God.

01:24:20.962 --> 01:24:22.161
This is my spare one. Take this.

01:24:22.163 --> 01:24:23.932
Let's get going.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.877
Are you alright?

01:24:36.979 --> 01:24:39.579
Mark Berner! Maestro!

01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:41.617
Thank you. Thank you.

01:25:05.908 --> 01:25:08.942
<i>♪ Lully, lullay</i>

01:25:08.944 --> 01:25:13.112
<i>♪ Thou little tiny child</i>

01:25:13.114 --> 01:25:19.822
<i>♪ Bye bye, lully, lullay...</i>

01:25:31.632 --> 01:25:36.872
<i>♪ Lullay ♪</i>

01:26:26.354 --> 01:26:28.354
Thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:28.356 --> 01:26:32.258
We do actually have a couple
of encores up our sleeve.

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.960
Very arrogant of us, I know.

01:26:33.962 --> 01:26:37.097
But as it's not February
and not the 14th,

01:26:37.099 --> 01:26:39.732
we thought we'd do
<i>My Funny Valentine.</i>

01:27:10.332 --> 01:27:13.799
Fiona. Fiona, that's the wrong
one. I haven't got the words.

01:27:13.801 --> 01:27:15.304
Fiona. Fiona?

01:27:21.842 --> 01:27:29.014
<i>♪ Down by the Salley Gardens</i>

01:27:29.016 --> 01:27:35.988
<i>♪ My love and I did meet</i>

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:42.861
<i>♪ She passed the Salley Gardens</i>

01:27:42.863 --> 01:27:50.070
<i>♪ With little snow-white feet</i>

01:27:50.072 --> 01:27:56.809
<i>♪ She bid me take love easy</i>

01:27:56.811 --> 01:28:03.415
<i>♪ As the leaves grow

01:28:03.417 --> 01:28:11.191
<i>♪ But I being young and foolish</i>

01:28:11.193 --> 01:28:17.733
<i>♪ With her did not agree</i>

01:28:29.744 --> 01:28:37.049
<i>♪ In a field by the river</i>

01:28:37.051 --> 01:28:43.790
<i>♪ My love and I did stand</i>

01:28:43.792 --> 01:28:50.362
<i>♪ And on my leaning shoulder...</i>

01:29:19.293 --> 01:29:21.928
My Lady, that was
so beautifully done.

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:24.133
- Thanks.
- Beautiful.

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.737
Thank you, Jim.

01:29:36.043 --> 01:29:38.012
Taxi!

01:29:39.547 --> 01:29:42.751
Camberwell.
St David's Hospice, please.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.502
Adam Henry?

01:30:48.216 --> 01:30:49.919
Adam.

01:30:52.052 --> 01:30:55.190
Adam, it's Fiona Maye.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.262
Adam.

01:31:02.564 --> 01:31:06.569
Remember, all of life and love.

01:31:08.403 --> 01:31:10.139
And poetry.

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:17.413
We could be on that ship
sailing round the world.

01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:22.451
Talking about why some...

01:31:26.287 --> 01:31:28.523
...songs are so...

01:31:29.623 --> 01:31:31.594
Adam. Adam.

01:31:33.228 --> 01:31:34.930
Adam.

01:31:48.009 --> 01:31:49.912
My choice.

01:31:55.317 --> 01:31:56.985
My Lady.

01:33:04.219 --> 01:33:08.487
"My Lady, you never told me
what you believed in."

01:33:08.489 --> 01:33:09.789
"I bet it isn't God. But what?"

01:33:09.791 --> 01:33:12.125
"And me?
I just don't know any more."

01:33:12.127 --> 01:33:15.361
"Sometimes, in strange moods, I
think, well, I'm an adult now."

01:33:15.363 --> 01:33:18.734
"This thing will come back. I
just know it will. And then...

01:33:20.568 --> 01:33:23.005
I could be free."

01:33:25.073 --> 01:33:26.539
Free.

01:33:28.576 --> 01:33:30.546
Fiona?

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:34.682
Fiona?

01:33:40.622 --> 01:33:42.358
Fi?

01:33:45.426 --> 01:33:47.429
You're soaking.

01:33:49.264 --> 01:33:50.565
Fi.

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.668
What happened?

01:34:00.809 --> 01:34:03.145
Fi, what is it?

01:34:07.614 --> 01:34:09.848
Come on.

01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:14.122
Even Mrs Justice Maye
owes an explanation sometimes.

01:34:15.457 --> 01:34:18.060
Come on, darling, talk to me.

01:34:20.862 --> 01:34:24.600
I heard about this young man.

01:34:26.734 --> 01:34:28.300
And?

01:34:28.302 --> 01:34:32.541
From the, um...
Jehovah's Witness case.

01:34:34.274 --> 01:34:37.410
- The what?
- In all the papers.

01:34:37.412 --> 01:34:39.615
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

01:34:41.349 --> 01:34:45.550
He was in hospital
and I left the court

01:34:45.552 --> 01:34:47.553
and went to his bedside.

01:34:47.555 --> 01:34:52.293
- Uh-huh. Isn't that unusual?
- Yes, it was, very unusual.

01:34:54.828 --> 01:34:56.764
And then?

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.239
A very strange and beautiful
young man, very, very ill.

01:35:05.472 --> 01:35:10.445
We, um... sang a song together.

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.617
He followed me
up to Newcastle. He...

01:35:17.652 --> 01:35:20.852
He walked through a storm
to find me.

01:35:20.854 --> 01:35:25.157
He wanted to go round the world
in a ship with me.

01:35:25.159 --> 01:35:27.528
He wanted to come
and live with us.

01:35:28.829 --> 01:35:30.431
With us?

01:35:31.698 --> 01:35:33.367
I mean, he...

01:35:34.668 --> 01:35:39.273
He thought I could...
change his life...

01:35:40.274 --> 01:35:42.375
answer all his questions.

01:35:42.377 --> 01:35:44.513
He was just a dreamer, but I...

01:35:47.715 --> 01:35:51.183
I thought I was being kind,
you see.

01:35:51.185 --> 01:35:53.755
I should have...
I should have...

01:35:56.591 --> 01:36:01.730
He couldn't understand
why his parents...

01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:07.803
Their only son.

01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:15.407
What happened? What's his name?
Where is he now?

01:36:15.409 --> 01:36:17.476
Adam. His name is Adam. He...

01:36:17.478 --> 01:36:19.978
I heard tonight
his cancer came back, his thing,

01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.917
and they need to transfuse him.

01:36:23.784 --> 01:36:25.451
And he's refused.

01:36:25.453 --> 01:36:28.588
He's 18. There's nothing
the hospital can do.

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:30.856
He's refused and his lungs
are filling with blood

01:36:30.858 --> 01:36:32.561
and he's dying.

01:36:35.496 --> 01:36:37.733
He's dying for his faith.

01:36:43.704 --> 01:36:45.870
Were you in love with him,
Fiona?

01:36:45.872 --> 01:36:48.576
Oh, Jack.

01:36:51.246 --> 01:36:54.550
He was just a child.

01:36:56.917 --> 01:36:58.686
A boy.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:03.224
A lovely boy.

01:37:05.693 --> 01:37:07.963
A lovely boy.

01:37:11.733 --> 01:37:13.802
It's OK.

01:37:18.338 --> 01:37:19.875
OK.

01:37:59.613 --> 01:38:01.782
I've been watching you sleep.

01:38:02.884 --> 01:38:04.653
Thank you.

01:38:06.587 --> 01:38:08.323
Jack, he...

01:38:12.393 --> 01:38:14.695
Such a waste.

01:38:15.529 --> 01:38:17.265
Yes.

01:38:18.332 --> 01:38:21.000
I was cruel to him.

01:38:21.002 --> 01:38:23.872
- No.
- But you don't know.

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:29.344
Then tell me. Everything.

01:38:34.948 --> 01:38:37.286
Will you still love me?

01:40:05.133 --> 01:40:10.133
