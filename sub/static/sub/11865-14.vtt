02:14.189 --> 02:16.692
Ask most kids what their favorite game is,

02:16.859 --> 02:19.570
they'll probably say hide-and-go-seek.

02:20.445 --> 02:21.780
I know I loved it.

02:22.489 --> 02:23.573
One mississippi.

02:24.074 --> 02:25.325
Two mississippi...

02:27.286 --> 02:30.497
For most kids, the fun of the game isn't in the hiding.

02:31.248 --> 02:33.416
The fun is in being found.

02:35.293 --> 02:36.670
But not for me.

02:37.671 --> 02:39.298
I didn't want to be found.

02:39.464 --> 02:40.257
Here I come!

02:40.299 --> 02:41.008
Ever.

02:45.303 --> 02:46.179
Got you.

02:48.723 --> 02:50.851
They'll never find me.

02:52.853 --> 02:54.355
And they never would.

02:57.774 --> 02:59.276
One mississippi.

02:59.401 --> 03:00.944
Two mississippi.

03:01.403 --> 03:04.364
Three mississippi, four.

03:05.657 --> 03:06.784
Daddy's funny.

03:07.910 --> 03:09.994
It's almost time for bed, Rosie.

03:10.078 --> 03:12.122
But I'm hiding, and you can't find me.

03:16.502 --> 03:17.461
Got you.

03:21.589 --> 03:23.300
- Morning, Kiffany.
- Morning.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.093
Oatmeal with raisins?

03:25.218 --> 03:28.764
I'm over the oatmeal. No more oatmeal.

03:28.806 --> 03:30.891
Having a look at the menu for once.

03:31.058 --> 03:32.268
Am I the first one here?

03:32.393 --> 03:34.477
No, one of you never left.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.355
Mama?

03:37.439 --> 03:38.690
Stay out of the kitchen.

03:39.233 --> 03:41.276
Don't let me catch him sleeping back there again.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.695
It's unsanitary.

03:43.195 --> 03:47.324
Wow. I had this dream last night about waffles,

03:47.616 --> 03:52.454
and it was really horrible because I was being chased by a big butter pat,

03:52.538 --> 03:57.917
and I couldn't get anywhere because I was waist-high in maple syrup.

03:58.585 --> 04:00.921
Did you really sleep here last night?

04:01.004 --> 04:02.881
Yeah, it's quite comfortable, actually.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.634
The supple linoleum is quite nice.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.763
Can I have some pancakes?

04:08.804 --> 04:10.180
If I can see some money.

04:11.181 --> 04:13.016
I'll... cover him.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.894
Ooh, in that case, I'll have some bacon as well, not too crispy.

04:16.019 --> 04:17.062
Not too chewy.

04:17.478 --> 04:18.564
Just in-between.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.984
Why are you sleeping here?

04:23.068 --> 04:24.861
I told you you could stay with us.

04:24.986 --> 04:26.071
She said I couldn't.

04:27.656 --> 04:28.532
Oh, really?

04:28.615 --> 04:30.242
She said that she doesn't want me in your house,

04:30.284 --> 04:32.411
and she wants nothing more to do with me ever.

04:32.536 --> 04:33.496
I never said that.

04:33.579 --> 04:37.082
What I said was I don't think it's wise for you to live with us.

04:37.165 --> 04:39.209
Since when have I given a fuck about wise?

04:39.293 --> 04:41.545
Let me make this stunningly simple for you.

04:41.628 --> 04:43.547
You can't live with us.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.758
Okay. I'll live here.

04:45.883 --> 04:48.260
I'm going to put the "haus" back in der waffle haus,

04:48.343 --> 04:52.806
and I'm going to sleep right here, on this lovely bit of naugahyde.

04:52.931 --> 04:54.016
You can't sleep here.

04:54.058 --> 04:54.808
Why not?

04:55.267 --> 04:56.102
Because

04:56.268 --> 04:57.353
it's a place of business,

04:58.062 --> 04:59.312
for them and for us.

04:59.646 --> 05:01.064
You don't sleep in your office, do you?

05:01.398 --> 05:02.774
I've slept in my office.

05:03.150 --> 05:04.818
Really sound sleep too.

05:04.860 --> 05:06.779
Drool all over my keyboard.

05:06.946 --> 05:09.573
Wake up, got no fucking idea where I am.

05:10.490 --> 05:11.241
Look...

05:12.451 --> 05:13.327
I don't mean to be rude,

05:13.410 --> 05:15.788
but I'd like to be left alone.

05:16.038 --> 05:16.914
Meaning?

05:17.748 --> 05:18.707
Please leave.

05:19.416 --> 05:20.793
I've just ordered breakfast.

05:20.835 --> 05:22.211
Well, get it to go. Please.

05:24.796 --> 05:27.007
I like your top. It's very stylish.

05:27.174 --> 05:30.344
Men don't wear tops. They wear shirts.

05:32.346 --> 05:34.140
"I like your top"? What the fuck was that?

05:34.265 --> 05:35.849
I was just trying to be nice.

05:36.808 --> 05:40.145
If you really wanted to be nice, Daisy,

05:40.229 --> 05:41.563
you would take in a boarder.

05:41.647 --> 05:42.648
You know what, Mason?

05:42.940 --> 05:44.525
I am nice to you,

05:44.775 --> 05:48.153
and I want to continue to be nice to you, which is why you cannot live with us,

05:48.195 --> 05:50.948
and don't you make promises about our house without consulting with me first.

05:51.031 --> 05:51.824
Fine.

05:51.907 --> 05:52.992
Okay, just so we're clear,

05:53.033 --> 05:56.954
that was my house before I gave it to you.

05:57.204 --> 05:58.331
Just so we're clear,

05:58.414 --> 06:01.416
that was some old dead woman's house before you stole it.

06:01.583 --> 06:02.835
Keep out of it, Georgie.

06:03.418 --> 06:04.128
Fine.

06:04.420 --> 06:05.796
Things have changed, Mason.

06:08.382 --> 06:11.092
Great, that's perfect. So I'm on the street. That's it, then.

06:11.218 --> 06:12.886
Oh, I don't know. Things change.

06:12.970 --> 06:15.097
Mason, Mason, Mason.

06:15.222 --> 06:17.808
Penny, my darling, how are you? So good to see you.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.185
- This is Geo--
- Hi, George.

06:19.268 --> 06:20.353
How do you guys know each other?

06:20.686 --> 06:22.146
How do you guys know each other?

06:22.271 --> 06:25.482
Hey... long time no see. What brings you here?

06:25.607 --> 06:26.775
I'm here to see the man.

06:26.859 --> 06:28.485
All roads lead to Rube.

06:29.153 --> 06:31.489
- Flapjacks, $7.95.
- Keep it.

06:31.614 --> 06:32.573
Oh, thank you.

06:32.698 --> 06:34.992
- Nice seeing you, sweetheart.
- You too.

06:35.034 --> 06:38.120
So you were part of Rube's little post-it squad?

06:38.203 --> 06:40.956
I was, long before post-its were in vogue.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.750
So I take it you've been dead a while.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.002
- That depends.
- On?

06:45.253 --> 06:46.754
What you think a while is.

06:46.879 --> 06:48.714
Penny's been dead forever and a day.

06:49.381 --> 06:50.340
How'd you die?

06:50.716 --> 06:51.925
Boating accident.

06:52.009 --> 06:54.762
Sailing? Water-skiing? Fall out of a dinghy?

06:55.262 --> 06:55.971
Bigger.

06:56.222 --> 06:59.350
Mason... you owe me 200 bucks.

06:59.434 --> 07:01.226
Do-- really, do I?

07:01.351 --> 07:02.186
You do.

07:02.394 --> 07:04.271
- A bet's a bet.
- Yeah.

07:05.272 --> 07:06.565
Nice to see you, George.

07:07.608 --> 07:08.609
What was the bet?

07:08.859 --> 07:09.944
The bet was...

07:10.027 --> 07:11.820
we had to guess what year Rube died.

07:11.903 --> 07:13.572
Whoever won got the two hundred.

07:13.614 --> 07:14.740
What was your guess?

07:14.782 --> 07:17.576
I have no idea, and it was 30 years ago, so I'm not paying.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.954
1927.

07:20.371 --> 07:22.665
Now someone owes me 200 bucks.

07:34.051 --> 07:36.012
Hey, Reg, how are you doing?

07:36.053 --> 07:36.887
Fine.

07:37.346 --> 07:38.931
Do you want some oatmeal with raisins?

07:39.014 --> 07:40.891
I'm sick of oatmeal. No more oatmeal.

07:40.975 --> 07:42.476
Then why don't you take a breakfast bar.

07:42.518 --> 07:46.355
There's maple. There's cranberry. There's maple cranberry.

07:46.481 --> 07:47.440
What are you doing?

07:50.067 --> 07:55.781
Sweetie, I know this is hard, but I have to pack away all of J.D.'S things.

07:56.407 --> 07:57.450
No, you don't.

07:57.533 --> 08:00.494
You're right, I don't, but I want to.

08:01.036 --> 08:03.122
- I think it's best.
- I don't.

08:03.163 --> 08:05.791
We all miss J.D... very much.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.793
Then why are you throwing away his shit?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.963
You know, Reggie, all the qualities you could inherit from your sister,

08:11.047 --> 08:12.965
does foul language need to be one of them?

08:13.048 --> 08:16.135
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm not throwing away anything.

08:16.510 --> 08:19.096
I'm labeling and storing his things

08:19.513 --> 08:20.681
so that maybe,

08:21.015 --> 08:22.141
when we're ready,

08:22.850 --> 08:24.394
we could get another dog.

08:24.768 --> 08:26.311
What if J.D. comes back?

08:27.688 --> 08:30.816
- Sweetie, he's not.
- Maybe it wasn't him.

08:31.150 --> 08:34.236
I didn't even look at that dog very long after it happened.

08:35.029 --> 08:35.780
Honey.

08:35.863 --> 08:38.657
- What color is George?
- What?

08:38.741 --> 08:41.118
What color did you label george's stuff?

08:42.077 --> 08:43.120
I don't remember.

08:43.203 --> 08:44.872
The shit you didn't sell in the yard sale.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.960
We need to accept that J.D.'S gone, sweetie.

08:52.254 --> 08:55.216
- I'm giving J.F. a bath.
- Who's J.F.?

08:57.635 --> 08:59.387
The frog George left me.

09:00.221 --> 09:01.014
Reggie.

09:02.264 --> 09:04.767
Why do you believe that George left you that frog?

09:05.184 --> 09:06.977
Because she knew I needed it.

09:07.395 --> 09:09.105
No, honey, what I mean is...

09:12.775 --> 09:13.817
Okay, you know what?

09:14.109 --> 09:18.406
I think you need to go with your father and I to the pet parlor.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.199
Yeah, you know?

09:20.283 --> 09:21.951
You could get out of school a little early.

09:21.993 --> 09:23.703
- Would you like that?
- No.

09:26.955 --> 09:28.791
Keep the frog out of the bathtub.

09:39.510 --> 09:41.220
- What can I get you?
- The usual.

09:41.303 --> 09:44.056
- Iced tea without the ice?
- That's it.

09:44.265 --> 09:46.392
To go, please. Thank you.

09:49.604 --> 09:51.772
You still doing that "no ice" nonsense?

09:52.147 --> 09:55.610
Hey, you go down with the Titanic, see how you feel about ice.

09:56.068 --> 09:57.028
Fair enough.

09:58.529 --> 09:59.572
For the record...

10:00.740 --> 10:02.241
I'm not doing this,

10:02.324 --> 10:05.494
but seeing as we go back a ways...

10:19.342 --> 10:20.468
Is this your reap?

10:24.138 --> 10:26.057
I don't know if I'm doing you a favor.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.725
I don't either.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.610
Thanks, Kiffany.

10:39.028 --> 10:40.738
- Don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

10:43.115 --> 10:46.661
- Well, look who's here.
- Oh, my god, Roxy.

10:46.744 --> 10:48.955
- I heard you were a cop.
- From who?

10:48.997 --> 10:50.581
Oh, you know, the old grapevine.

10:50.664 --> 10:53.083
You look great. You look great.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.877
I look like I always look.

10:57.046 --> 10:58.798
To what do we owe this honor?

10:59.465 --> 11:01.259
His daughter's going to die today.

11:03.969 --> 11:05.429
Take care of the old fool.

11:20.862 --> 11:23.114
I'm sorry. I tried to talk Daisy into it.

11:23.197 --> 11:24.449
Georgie, please. Come on.

11:24.491 --> 11:26.743
I would make a really bloody great roommate, you know?

11:26.825 --> 11:29.620
I make these boysenberry cobblers that would bring tears to your eyes.

11:29.662 --> 11:31.706
Actually, your breath is bringing tears to my eyes.

11:31.747 --> 11:34.459
You know what? I could be the watchdog, you know, security.

11:35.293 --> 11:38.129
Seriously, Mason, you need to get close to a toothbrush.

11:38.213 --> 11:40.130
Oh, god. I'll live off the wild, you know?

11:40.214 --> 11:41.966
I've got cunning. I've got street smarts.

11:42.717 --> 11:45.052
Wait, you lived to what, 27?

11:45.553 --> 11:48.473
I know, but all I know is I'm born for jungle life.

11:57.482 --> 11:58.358
I could do this.

11:59.943 --> 12:04.572
Last time I checked, you didn't exactly have the greatest success in street sales.

12:04.613 --> 12:07.033
Come on, look. He's doing really well. I could do this.

12:07.116 --> 12:10.036
That's because he's cute, and he can sing.

12:10.078 --> 12:10.870
I'm cute.

12:15.457 --> 12:16.417
George.

12:17.543 --> 12:20.755
That dollar could be part of the "Free Mason" fund.

12:21.631 --> 12:24.801
"Free Mason." Good one.

12:24.926 --> 12:25.802
I don't get it.

12:29.972 --> 12:30.890
You're really good.

12:31.390 --> 12:33.434
Thanks. You work around here?

12:34.477 --> 12:35.395
Sort of.

12:35.645 --> 12:39.483
I work different places, everywhere, really.

12:39.982 --> 12:42.568
So I guess you work here.

12:42.652 --> 12:46.030
Just moved here from New York. I was playing all over Manhattan.

12:46.114 --> 12:47.031
That's impressive.

12:47.323 --> 12:49.034
No, well, I was...

12:49.117 --> 12:51.036
playing in the subway system.

12:51.244 --> 12:54.330
It feels good to be outside again. I was underground for a year.

12:54.664 --> 12:56.666
I just feel so alive again.

12:57.041 --> 13:00.128
- Enjoy that while you can.
- Okay.

13:01.671 --> 13:04.673
Okay, really nice to meet you, my rock brother, you know?

13:04.757 --> 13:07.468
Keep on keeping on, and live fast, die young.

13:07.552 --> 13:10.388
You know, leave a good-looking corpse, and here's a quarter. I love your voice. Bye.

13:10.471 --> 13:11.347
Uh, bye.

13:11.681 --> 13:14.935
Mason, I was getting some piano-man attention.

13:15.101 --> 13:19.021
Okay, but don't kill that moment by prolonging it by George, and I stole his money.

13:21.774 --> 13:23.985
Mason, he knows you stole his money.

13:28.322 --> 13:29.490
One mississippi.

13:29.573 --> 13:30.449
Two mississippi.

13:30.950 --> 13:32.660
Reapers are supposed to hide.

13:32.869 --> 13:36.581
I mean, sure, you might bump into us on the street, but that's nobody.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.834
Three mississippi, four...

13:39.584 --> 13:43.045
We stay in the shadows where no one will ever find us.

13:43.087 --> 13:44.297
Georgia Lass.

13:45.506 --> 13:47.091
- What?
- What?

13:47.133 --> 13:48.468
I mean, who?

13:48.551 --> 13:49.844
Georgia Lass.

13:50.011 --> 13:52.097
I don't know who that is.

13:52.139 --> 13:53.973
You must have heard about her. Poor thing.

13:54.056 --> 13:57.894
A piece of the soviet space station fell right out of the sky and... pfft.

13:58.061 --> 14:00.146
Right. I do remember.

14:00.397 --> 14:01.815
Georgia Lass.

14:01.898 --> 14:03.275
All right, I got it.

14:03.358 --> 14:05.067
I hired her last year,

14:05.151 --> 14:07.570
and let me tell you something. This Georgia Lass...

14:07.653 --> 14:09.781
Was the most fascinating woman  you'd ever met?

14:09.864 --> 14:11.282
She disturbed me,

14:11.407 --> 14:13.618
and I can't quite shake her.

14:16.996 --> 14:19.415
This is for the personnel files.

14:19.874 --> 14:21.376
I want you to bring me her file,

14:21.459 --> 14:22.293
and Millie...

14:24.796 --> 14:25.547
What?

14:25.630 --> 14:28.008
The personnel files are for executives only.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.926
Remember, Georgia--

14:30.134 --> 14:32.679
Jesus, I heard you the first three times.

14:39.603 --> 14:42.480
- Hey, Reggie, how you doing?
- Fine.

14:43.481 --> 14:45.483
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

14:46.734 --> 14:49.946
- Your dad's here.
- Go away.

14:57.912 --> 15:00.206
Usually, you can't compete with the dead.

15:00.665 --> 15:02.667
No one speaks ill of the dead.

15:03.919 --> 15:07.547
Dead people are always nicer, prettier, smarter...

15:10.133 --> 15:13.386
Death has a way of cleaning up a girl's reputation.

15:14.346 --> 15:17.890
So, what the fuck did Georgia Lass ever do to Delores?

15:23.313 --> 15:25.357
Actually, the better question was

15:25.398 --> 15:27.526
what the fuck did Georgia Lass ever do?

15:30.236 --> 15:31.154
Is she coming down?

15:32.405 --> 15:34.699
She's staring at her new frog.

15:35.283 --> 15:35.992
Okay.

15:36.451 --> 15:37.494
Listen, Clancy...

15:39.579 --> 15:40.497
Reggie--

15:42.999 --> 15:44.000
oh, never mind.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.960
No, Joy. No never mind.

15:46.044 --> 15:47.045
No, it's really nothing.

15:47.128 --> 15:50.257
Joy, how can I parent her if I don't know what the hell I'm dealing with here?

15:50.549 --> 15:52.509
Reggie thinks J.D. isn't dead.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.343
That's completely normal.

15:54.969 --> 15:58.932
- She thinks George left her the frog.
- That's not.

15:59.057 --> 16:01.226
I think it's time she went back into counseling.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.854
Hi, Joy. Got a minute?

16:04.146 --> 16:07.273
Oh, actually, Claire, you know what? I really don't right now.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.692
- Oh, hi, Clancy.
- Claire.

16:10.068 --> 16:11.903
I just wanted to tell you

16:11.987 --> 16:14.906
that three of my best friends saw how you organized my kitchen,

16:14.948 --> 16:16.909
and every single one of them wants to call you.

16:17.159 --> 16:19.202
Oh, that's-- that's great...

16:19.369 --> 16:21.830
but maybe we could talk about this tomorrow, okay,

16:21.955 --> 16:23.873
because now is just not so great a time.

16:26.042 --> 16:30.713
And I also wanted to ask you if you would take a look at my present-wrapping station.

16:30.797 --> 16:33.216
I think I could set it up a little better in the family room--

16:33.299 --> 16:36.094
What about "now's not a good time" don't you understand?

16:36.219 --> 16:37.846
- Clancy.
- Excuse me?

16:37.929 --> 16:39.389
You left the gate to our yard open?

16:39.931 --> 16:41.266
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:41.308 --> 16:43.601
- The hell you don't.
- Clancy.

16:43.685 --> 16:44.894
No, Joy, let's say it.

16:44.978 --> 16:49.191
This is the woman who complains about our dog taking a crap into her precious flowers

16:49.274 --> 16:54.655
and then, suddenly, the dog is accidentally let out and then dies.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.908
He's just upset. He loved the dog.

16:59.993 --> 17:01.953
I'm sorry for your loss...

17:02.871 --> 17:03.664
again.

17:04.998 --> 17:06.999
- I'm going to go now.
- You do that.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.085
Try not to kill any more dogs.

17:13.423 --> 17:17.678
Jesus Christ, Clancy, I still live here.

17:17.845 --> 17:20.555
- I have to see her.
- Things have to be said.

17:22.557 --> 17:25.101
So. Counseling for Reggie.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.561
Or whoever's interested and available.

17:33.693 --> 17:35.862
I just feel sick,

17:36.571 --> 17:38.240
sick and tired...

17:42.536 --> 17:44.579
and I miss the stupid dog.

17:48.583 --> 17:49.835
I miss you.

17:51.044 --> 17:52.588
I miss my daughters.

17:57.008 --> 17:58.218
I miss everything.

18:01.638 --> 18:03.640
Who the fuck you calling insolent?

18:03.724 --> 18:06.018
When interviewing, they tell you to relax,

18:06.060 --> 18:07.436
to just be yourself.

18:07.936 --> 18:09.562
Well, look what that got me.

18:11.314 --> 18:12.816
I'm already dead.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.235
Curiosity can't kill me.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.031
I bet they all lied to Delores.

18:19.698 --> 18:23.451
What are they all hiding? What's the real story?

18:30.167 --> 18:32.126
So, Misty?

18:32.919 --> 18:35.589
- Any children?
- No.

18:35.755 --> 18:37.966
- Are you single?
- Yes.

18:38.425 --> 18:39.509
Misty.

18:40.969 --> 18:45.306
I have two children, Sassoon and Jordache, and...

18:45.348 --> 18:48.768
I think I'm still married in the state of Louisiana

18:48.935 --> 18:51.438
and probably Kansas.

18:52.022 --> 18:53.941
Topeka's in Kansas, isn't it?

19:13.251 --> 19:15.754
Special forces, Crystal?

19:33.938 --> 19:37.651
God, I couldn't even land this job without a note from my mom.

19:38.276 --> 19:41.155
I guess everybody owes somebody else something,

19:42.573 --> 19:44.742
something they have to do.

19:46.159 --> 19:47.285
Hi, Rosie.

19:49.454 --> 19:50.664
What are you doing up?

19:51.206 --> 19:52.583
You should be asleep, peanut.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.754
Where are you going?

20:00.382 --> 20:01.800
Go back to sleep.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.054
But I'm up now. Where are you going, papa?

20:07.598 --> 20:09.808
I'm going to get a few things your mother needs.

20:11.893 --> 20:13.937
When are you coming back?

20:15.188 --> 20:16.231
Soon.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.778
"I'll be loving you" sing it, papa.

20:26.491 --> 20:29.453
I'll be loving you

20:30.120 --> 20:32.456
always

20:32.832 --> 20:35.292
with a love that's true

20:35.584 --> 20:37.711
always

20:38.629 --> 20:41.215
when things you've planned

20:41.799 --> 20:44.135
need a helping hand

20:45.052 --> 20:47.095
I will understand

20:47.721 --> 20:49.264
always

21:09.577 --> 21:11.369
Hell, no, you can't live with me.

21:11.453 --> 21:12.162
Why not?

21:12.746 --> 21:13.997
Because you can't.

21:14.122 --> 21:15.749
Why? Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

21:15.874 --> 21:17.584
Because I live there,

21:17.710 --> 21:20.212
and you drive me fucking nuts as it is.

21:20.254 --> 21:23.465
Okay. I'm homeless and proud of it.

21:23.548 --> 21:24.633
Well, you should be.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.678
All these fucking assumptions society makes, man.

21:27.761 --> 21:28.971
It's, like, you know,

21:29.179 --> 21:30.097
get a job,

21:30.389 --> 21:31.682
eat food,

21:31.807 --> 21:33.017
live in a house.

21:33.434 --> 21:37.104
It's fascism, that is, absolute fucking fascism.

21:37.187 --> 21:38.188
I won't take it.

21:38.856 --> 21:40.274
I'm going to live in the moment.

21:40.649 --> 21:42.192
I'm living off the land.

21:42.568 --> 21:43.819
Sounds like loitering.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.154
Please, let me live with you, Roxy.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.322
Please, I'll sleep in the bloody bathtub.

21:47.405 --> 21:49.116
Then what will I tell my boyfriend?

21:53.120 --> 21:53.787
What?

21:53.871 --> 21:55.706
See? You don't know me.

21:55.998 --> 21:56.832
Okay.

21:59.126 --> 22:02.004
Live off the land. Fucking pioneer.

22:05.382 --> 22:09.845
All right, I'm going to stake my own claim and claim my own steak.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.016
I mean, it's just like picking berries, really, isn't it?

22:14.099 --> 22:14.808
Ugh.

22:15.392 --> 22:16.852
Foraging in nature.

22:18.062 --> 22:19.647
Did you take that man's steak?

22:19.730 --> 22:22.983
He was finished, and we wouldn't want to waste food, now, would we, Kiffany,

22:23.024 --> 22:25.319
not when there are children starving in Boston.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.280
How about my paying customer?

22:28.447 --> 22:30.407
I'll have a cobb salad, Kiffany.

22:34.537 --> 22:37.039
You're making all the wrong moves, Mason.

22:37.164 --> 22:37.873
Right.

22:47.632 --> 22:48.634
Coffee?

22:49.343 --> 22:50.260
No, thank you.

22:50.594 --> 22:52.930
I know you didn't just steal that money from me.

22:53.138 --> 22:54.682
I was keeping it safe for you.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.475
I wanted you to get-get it.

22:58.019 --> 22:59.186
You're out.

23:00.228 --> 23:00.854
Out?

23:00.938 --> 23:03.107
That's right. Out of my house.

23:03.190 --> 23:06.026
- This is Der Waffle Haus.
- And you're der-out-of-here.

23:06.861 --> 23:10.615
Kiffany, I've had a really bad... couple of days.

23:10.782 --> 23:14.660
That's one cobb salad, and he better be gone by the time I get back.

23:18.789 --> 23:21.667
You heard what the lady said. You got to go.

23:21.876 --> 23:22.502
No.

23:29.884 --> 23:31.385
Have you ever heard of police brutality?

23:31.469 --> 23:33.304
Because that is police brutality.

23:33.387 --> 23:35.473
You really don't get it, do you, Mason?

23:35.597 --> 23:38.267
This is our home, and you just pissed all over it.

23:38.308 --> 23:40.060
I was living off the fat of the land.

23:40.102 --> 23:43.939
No, what you were doing was disrespecting the last place you actually belong

23:44.023 --> 23:45.650
and the only living person you know

23:45.733 --> 23:48.193
that puts up with your freeze-dried bullshit.

23:48.235 --> 23:50.154
Do you call that putting up with me?

23:51.155 --> 23:54.408
I'd call that breaking the camel's back.

23:54.909 --> 23:58.162
Enjoy the streets, Mason, that's all you got.

24:15.137 --> 24:18.098
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah. Me too.

24:27.232 --> 24:29.068
I feel like I've been here before.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.945
You've buried an animal here before?

24:31.404 --> 24:32.572
No, but...

24:33.614 --> 24:37.409
I'm having the most powerful sense of deja vu. It's weird.

24:38.535 --> 24:39.620
Good afternoon.

24:40.037 --> 24:41.038
I'm Jed.

24:41.205 --> 24:44.125
Can I offer you folks a cold beverage or a snack?

24:44.208 --> 24:46.377
No, thank you. I'm good. Reg?

24:46.502 --> 24:47.628
No, thanks.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.672
You've looked over the options for burial and cremation?

24:50.756 --> 24:51.757
Are there any questions?

24:51.924 --> 24:54.844
I feel like I've been here before. Is that crazy?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.346
You probably remember it in its previous incarnation...

24:57.972 --> 24:59.557
as a Foster's Freeze.

24:59.849 --> 25:02.434
I was on the grill, and my wife was on the till.

25:03.644 --> 25:06.856
- Is she a redhead?
- More auburn, really.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.901
No real future in milkshakes, I'm afraid.

25:09.984 --> 25:11.945
Death just makes much better business sense.

25:12.070 --> 25:12.694
Well...

25:13.529 --> 25:14.530
congratulations.

25:14.613 --> 25:15.155
Thank you.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.284
That's for your smaller dog,

25:18.492 --> 25:19.452
your yorkie,

25:19.577 --> 25:22.455
your lhasa apso, your shih tzu, your chihuahua,

25:22.663 --> 25:23.665
and your wiener dog,

25:23.748 --> 25:24.915
anything in your toy group.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.542
J.D. Was a big dog.

25:27.334 --> 25:28.878
He was a golden retriever.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.464
Well, I'm sure he was a very beautiful dog.

25:31.505 --> 25:32.798
He really was.

25:36.928 --> 25:43.351
Uh, I think we might need some more time to discuss this as a family.

25:43.601 --> 25:45.895
Absolutely. You and your husband and your daughter,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.855
you take all the time you want, okay?

25:47.981 --> 25:48.773
Actually, we're...

25:50.607 --> 25:52.985
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.951
You know what? Why don't we take J.D. home and do this together?

26:01.368 --> 26:03.245
- Would that be okay, Reg?
- Okay.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.339
The things we do for love.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.094
Ray.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.973
Go away.

26:26.477 --> 26:29.939
- Dead girl, coming through.
- Oh, Millie, that's terrible.

26:30.064 --> 26:31.607
Just stating the facts.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.569
- Well, let's see what we have here.
- Not much.

26:35.236 --> 26:37.447
I-- not that I was looking at it.

26:37.489 --> 26:40.658
It's just kind of, you know... thin.

26:40.991 --> 26:42.118
Well, you're in the know now.

26:42.159 --> 26:43.619
Might as well hear this with me.

26:43.953 --> 26:46.331
"Attitude-- insolent."

26:46.539 --> 26:50.209
Don't you think the better word would be... saucy?

26:50.459 --> 26:53.212
Am I right or am I right? She was saucy.

26:53.295 --> 26:56.174
"Without manners. No respect for authority."

26:56.716 --> 26:58.843
Kids today, I tell you.

26:58.926 --> 27:00.595
"Ambition-- none."

27:00.678 --> 27:03.180
Maybe she just didn't share her ambition with you.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.015
Well, I certainly didn't see any.

27:06.183 --> 27:10.063
"Future forecast-- won't last long."

27:10.104 --> 27:11.856
Well, you nailed that one.

27:12.148 --> 27:15.317
- Her poor mother.
- Yeah.

27:15.818 --> 27:18.070
At least she was pretty.

27:18.613 --> 27:20.907
What's she going to think when she reads this?

27:21.574 --> 27:23.159
Why would she do that?

27:24.077 --> 27:25.495
She came to see me.

27:25.704 --> 27:28.289
I told her I'd give her my paperwork on her daughter.

27:29.498 --> 27:31.417
I felt it was the least I could do.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.796
Such a short life. Anything she might have touched, it's precious.

27:34.837 --> 27:37.173
You can't show that to her mother.

27:37.298 --> 27:40.676
Millie. I trash-talked a dead girl on this page,

27:40.801 --> 27:42.720
and now I to have to live with that.

27:42.803 --> 27:45.598
- Well, it's not too late--
- Oh, Millie, it is.

27:45.682 --> 27:46.808
No, it's not!

27:48.518 --> 27:51.687
A little white-out and no one's the wiser.

27:53.272 --> 27:58.027
Are you suggesting we tamper with official happy time documents?

27:58.194 --> 28:00.238
I'm not saying...

28:01.489 --> 28:02.781
I'm just saying...

28:02.865 --> 28:05.451
That's against everything I stand for.

28:05.743 --> 28:07.203
Not everything.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.080
Not everything you taught me.

28:09.956 --> 28:10.915
It's just...

28:11.291 --> 28:12.959
It's the right thing to do.

28:15.377 --> 28:17.338
Do you want to type or should I?

28:41.237 --> 28:42.405
I know what to do.

28:44.574 --> 28:50.580
I still think we should say she was a misunderstood genius.

28:50.705 --> 28:54.417
I think she was complicated, Millie. She wasn't a genius.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.629
But she seemed smart, right?

28:57.670 --> 28:58.463
Very.

28:58.671 --> 28:59.672
And funny.

29:00.048 --> 29:02.342
An odd charm, a certain je ne sais quoi...

29:02.425 --> 29:03.759
I know exactly what to write.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.428
I know what will make her mother proud.

29:05.678 --> 29:06.387
What?

29:06.762 --> 29:08.347
I'm going to base her on you.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.602
I thought we wanted to make her seem...

29:12.852 --> 29:14.354
impressive.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.480
You are impressive.

29:16.814 --> 29:17.732
I've watched you.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.693
In one year, Millie, in one short year,

29:20.735 --> 29:22.654
you've grown into a fine young woman.

29:22.820 --> 29:25.740
I'm sure Georgia's mom will be pleased.

29:26.283 --> 29:28.993
Maybe there are no second chances in life...

29:30.077 --> 29:30.912
Done.

29:31.329 --> 29:33.331
But then again, what do I know?

30:02.569 --> 30:04.029
It's a hard way to earn a living.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.572
Any day above ground is a good one, right?

30:06.823 --> 30:09.784
Yeah, enjoy that while you can.

30:17.708 --> 30:18.543
Ray.

30:22.297 --> 30:24.549
You know, I'm kind of a gym rat. Yeah.

30:25.592 --> 30:27.385
Yeah, spin class, yoga...

30:28.261 --> 30:29.095
a little tae bo.

30:30.513 --> 30:32.598
Look, baby, I don't want to brag,

30:32.807 --> 30:34.392
but I'm hung like a jury.

30:37.437 --> 30:40.315
My name's Pete. Dollar for a tune?

30:40.440 --> 30:43.568
Doesn't it bother you, having to depend on other people's handouts?

30:43.693 --> 30:46.196
I've always relied on the kindness of strangers.

30:46.321 --> 30:49.240
Well, I've played Blanche Dubois for a lifetime, so...

30:49.324 --> 30:51.576
- So you must get it.
- I do.

30:58.416 --> 31:00.919
- What was that?
- It's for luck.

31:01.503 --> 31:03.588
If you've got a good one, now would be the time.

31:12.389 --> 31:13.765
No, I can go all night.

31:15.267 --> 31:17.268
I'm like an animal, baby.

31:17.727 --> 31:19.228
Yeah, I'm dangerous.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.023
I'm like a bull moose in heat. Mm!

31:23.274 --> 31:23.983
Credit card?

31:24.776 --> 31:26.278
What, you need my credit card already?

31:26.570 --> 31:29.530
I mean, we hardly know each other. All we're doing is talking here, right?

31:30.907 --> 31:33.284
I mean, for god's sake, nI've still got my pants on.

31:41.584 --> 31:42.919
Holy shit.

31:44.712 --> 31:45.672
Fuck me.

31:46.256 --> 31:47.507
No, no, not you, sweetheart.

31:48.341 --> 31:49.634
Staring at a maple leaf

31:50.719 --> 31:52.679
leaning on the mother tree

31:52.763 --> 31:55.098
I said to myself--

32:09.445 --> 32:10.488
What happened?

32:10.572 --> 32:12.282
Did you kill me?

32:13.033 --> 32:15.702
No. I'm your reaper.

32:16.161 --> 32:17.246
You died and...

32:19.205 --> 32:20.248
Uh-oh.

32:40.185 --> 32:41.520
Am I dead?

32:49.236 --> 32:50.529
Go away.

33:08.546 --> 33:10.799
I haven't figured out who she is yet.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.425
I'll let you know.

33:15.095 --> 33:16.388
She's over there.

33:17.431 --> 33:18.723
That's Rosie.

33:26.857 --> 33:28.650
I don't think I can do this.

33:31.986 --> 33:33.822
We think we can't do something.

33:34.239 --> 33:36.867
We think we can't, we think we can't, we think we can't...

33:38.702 --> 33:39.953
but we can.

33:47.168 --> 33:48.128
Okay, boy.

33:53.467 --> 33:55.843
Sweetie, do you want to say something?

33:58.179 --> 34:00.015
I'm sure J.D. would like it if you did.

34:05.646 --> 34:08.063
- Dear J.D.--
- It's not a letter, sweetheart.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.733
- Clancy.
- Sorry.

34:10.525 --> 34:12.027
Dear J.D...

34:14.112 --> 34:16.197
if you see George,

34:16.697 --> 34:18.367
tell her I say, "hey."

34:19.951 --> 34:22.746
Tell her it's all right to come back...

34:24.623 --> 34:27.042
and tell her thanks for the frog.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.754
Okay, well, that was lovely, sweetheart.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.590
I'm not done.

34:34.757 --> 34:35.467
Good.

34:38.971 --> 34:40.179
I'm sorry.

34:41.473 --> 34:43.100
I'm sorry I left the gate open.

34:45.601 --> 34:46.978
I'm sorry I got you killed.

34:53.277 --> 34:56.237
Leaving the gate open didn't kill J.D., sweetheart.

34:56.571 --> 35:00.200
There's lots of dogs who run all over the place, and they're okay.

35:01.034 --> 35:02.703
J.D. died...

35:04.037 --> 35:06.290
because it was just time for that to happen.

35:07.499 --> 35:10.877
It's not your fault, sweetheart. None of it is.

35:36.486 --> 35:38.447
I didn't say you could sit down.

35:43.285 --> 35:44.410
These are for you.

35:45.036 --> 35:47.205
- Did you steal those?
- No.

35:48.832 --> 35:51.126
- I picked them.
- From where?

35:51.585 --> 35:52.544
The forest.

35:52.628 --> 35:54.171
Posies don't grow in the shade.

35:54.254 --> 35:56.257
Okay, I picked them from somebody's yard,

35:56.340 --> 35:57.674
but there were literally thousands--

35:57.757 --> 36:00.719
actually, millions of them, so I don't think they'll be missed,

36:00.761 --> 36:04.640
and the point is, I picked them for you, so that's got to say something?

36:05.933 --> 36:08.394
If you stole them, I don't want them.

36:09.894 --> 36:11.062
I'm sorry.

36:12.272 --> 36:13.148
Kiffany...

36:13.732 --> 36:16.735
that was terrible of me. I shouldn't have stolen your tip.

36:17.236 --> 36:19.446
It wasn't my table. It was Kirstin's.

36:19.655 --> 36:24.201
I don't understand it. If it wasn't your tip, why are you so mad at me?

36:24.284 --> 36:25.827
We pool our tips.

36:25.953 --> 36:29.081
If someone has a good morning, everyone has a good morning.

36:29.373 --> 36:32.710
If someone gets stiffed, everybody gets stiffed.

36:32.959 --> 36:34.586
Do you understand what that means?

36:34.836 --> 36:36.671
I don't understand why you don't want your posies.

36:36.713 --> 36:39.925
I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "house."

36:40.259 --> 36:43.888
- It's a place where I can sleep.
- A place where you can feel safe.

36:44.221 --> 36:45.930
I don't feel safe anywhere.

36:47.349 --> 36:50.561
I've been having a fuck of a time lately, Kiffany...

36:52.354 --> 36:54.106
Just a world of pain...

36:56.108 --> 36:57.776
Same old, same old, eh?

37:01.363 --> 37:02.281
Sit.

37:07.119 --> 37:08.162
I work hard.

37:08.329 --> 37:09.205
I take orders.

37:09.412 --> 37:12.416
I bring people their food. It's very simple. No mystery.

37:13.583 --> 37:16.545
- You know why I stay here?
- Because you love waffles?

37:18.505 --> 37:21.633
It's a clean, well-lighted place...

37:23.468 --> 37:24.761
and I feel safe.

37:30.935 --> 37:31.602
Here.

37:36.982 --> 37:39.985
- I don't know what to say.
- Say, "thank you."

37:40.611 --> 37:42.905
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:44.573 --> 37:45.533
Hey.

37:56.252 --> 37:57.503
You can't sleep here.

38:04.134 --> 38:05.386
So...

38:06.303 --> 38:08.264
I guess I have to apologize to Claire.

38:09.390 --> 38:10.390
That'd be nice.

38:10.682 --> 38:11.975
Or you could apologize for me.

38:12.476 --> 38:13.185
No.

38:14.019 --> 38:15.729
What a fucking day.

38:18.524 --> 38:19.316
Yeah.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.276
So, what's for dinner?

38:22.903 --> 38:24.946
I don't know but

38:25.656 --> 38:27.157
you should probably go.

38:27.324 --> 38:28.409
I just thought...

38:28.701 --> 38:30.953
I mean, if Reggie needs anything.

38:31.162 --> 38:33.039
Yeah, thanks...

38:33.748 --> 38:35.582
but you should probably go home.

38:43.048 --> 38:46.385
- You were a good father today.
- Thanks.

38:47.552 --> 38:49.638
Doesn't make you a good husband.

38:51.098 --> 38:52.141
I know.

39:02.651 --> 39:04.320
Would you like to go for a walk?

39:05.696 --> 39:06.572
No.

39:08.741 --> 39:11.201
Are you hungry? I think they're serving dinner.

39:11.702 --> 39:15.831
No. I'm waiting for someone.

39:24.089 --> 39:27.009
- Hi, Rosie.
- Hi, papa.

39:39.938 --> 39:40.940
I'm sorry.

39:45.570 --> 39:46.737
Where are you going?

39:59.332 --> 40:00.876
Shh.

40:03.671 --> 40:08.217
It's all right. Go to sleep.

40:08.718 --> 40:12.888
"I'll be loving you" sing it, papa.

40:21.731 --> 40:24.858
I'll be loving you

40:25.776 --> 40:28.279
always

40:28.779 --> 40:32.366
with a love that's true

40:33.451 --> 40:35.703
always

40:38.664 --> 40:43.961
and the things you've planned need a helping hand

40:44.045 --> 40:46.631
I will understand

40:46.881 --> 40:50.843
always, always

40:51.719 --> 40:54.889
days may not be fair

40:55.306 --> 40:57.600
always

40:58.101 --> 41:00.727
that's when I'll be there

41:01.061 --> 41:02.896
always

41:04.648 --> 41:08.152
not for just an hour

41:08.319 --> 41:11.614
not for just a day

41:12.197 --> 41:15.993
not for just a year

41:17.036 --> 41:21.415
but always

41:22.709 --> 41:25.043
Are you leaving again, papa?

41:28.047 --> 41:29.298
No, Rosie.

41:32.134 --> 41:34.053
I'm not going anywhere.

41:52.112 --> 41:53.531
He's not staying here.

41:53.656 --> 41:56.409
You're being totally selfish.

41:56.492 --> 41:58.327
That's a fine sentiment coming from you.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.748
- Excuse me? I am the most--
- Self-involved is what you are, Georgia.

42:02.790 --> 42:05.793
You are always in your own head. It's like you're talking to yourself.

42:05.835 --> 42:06.627
Am I?

42:06.711 --> 42:07.920
She has got a point, Georgie.

42:08.004 --> 42:10.214
- Shut up, Mason.
- Fine. Jesus.

42:13.217 --> 42:14.760
He can have dinner with us.

42:15.177 --> 42:16.929
But then he has to go. He can't stay.

42:17.054 --> 42:18.389
So, what? Is he a dog now?

42:18.514 --> 42:21.601
Should we just put his food in a bowl and leave it out back?

42:21.684 --> 42:23.019
I actually wouldn't mind that.

42:23.102 --> 42:24.562
Shut the fuck up, Mason.

42:24.687 --> 42:26.772
I am trying to protect him.

42:26.897 --> 42:30.943
How is kicking someone to the curb going to protect them?

42:32.028 --> 42:34.781
You just think everyone is in love with you.

42:35.073 --> 42:36.616
Well, maybe they aren't.

42:36.825 --> 42:40.870
Maybe they just need a place to feel safe.

42:41.746 --> 42:43.831
That was very mean, Georgia.

42:43.915 --> 42:45.708
But not entirely inaccurate.

42:46.125 --> 42:47.710
Enough, Mason.

42:52.173 --> 42:55.426
No one is safe here. This is where you killed him.

42:56.052 --> 42:59.097
- He's not coming back.
- He did.

42:59.222 --> 43:00.098
Today.

43:00.431 --> 43:03.142
There was supposed to be one death, and there were two,

43:03.267 --> 43:05.853
and if Mason stays here, he's just going to get angrier and angrier.

43:05.895 --> 43:09.399
- Don't you get it?
- Well...

43:14.445 --> 43:16.155
it's my house too...

43:18.032 --> 43:20.326
and I'm not scared of anything.

43:21.911 --> 43:22.829
Fine.

43:27.082 --> 43:29.627
- Thanks, Georgie.
- No problem-O.

43:32.421 --> 43:35.758
- Stay out of my bedroom...
- That's no fun, my darling.

43:35.842 --> 43:38.344
And if you're not scared, you're just a fool.

43:43.683 --> 43:46.102
Oh, goodness, gracious me.

43:51.273 --> 43:52.441
Ghost stories?

43:54.610 --> 43:56.446
Paint each other's toenails?

43:56.988 --> 43:58.865
Just go to sleep, Mason.

43:59.616 --> 44:01.618
You'll stay here for a little bit, will you?

44:01.826 --> 44:02.534
Sure.

44:03.911 --> 44:05.454
Pull the covers over your head.

44:07.248 --> 44:09.417
No way. It always made me more scared,

44:09.876 --> 44:11.503
being in the dark.

44:13.129 --> 44:14.630
Will you leave the light on?

44:14.922 --> 44:17.675
I'll just stay here until you fall asleep.

44:17.883 --> 44:20.178
I don't think I'll ever fall asleep again.

44:29.854 --> 44:31.230
One mississippi.

44:31.314 --> 44:32.523
Two mississippi.

44:32.982 --> 44:33.775
Mason.

44:35.944 --> 44:38.821
I guess there's always something out there to hide from,

44:39.822 --> 44:42.450
something out there you just can't face.

44:43.075 --> 44:44.035
Three mississippi.

44:44.327 --> 44:45.578
Four mississippi.

44:46.037 --> 44:48.373
So you'll hide  for as long as you can...

44:49.541 --> 44:51.542
but that's not easy either,

44:52.877 --> 44:54.086
all that hiding...

44:55.671 --> 44:56.756
Five mississippi.

45:00.009 --> 45:03.053
In the end, what you were so afraid of

45:03.679 --> 45:06.682
turns out not to be so scary after all.

45:07.683 --> 45:10.186
Six mississippi, seven.

45:10.270 --> 45:12.439
Because you have to know that if you're hiding,

45:12.480 --> 45:13.815
more often than not,

45:14.482 --> 45:16.901
your fears will come looking for you.

45:16.984 --> 45:19.487
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

45:33.292 --> 45:35.420
I never liked you, Ray.

46:01.738 --> 46:04.323
Olly, olly, oxen free.

46:10.747 --> 46:16.335
