05:37.503 --> 05:38.731
Fuck.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.441
Weapon.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.007
It's time,
Freya.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.923
I told you before, Father

09:58.064 --> 10:00.157
the answer is no!

10:00.299 --> 10:02.961
Wulfric will be a good man!

10:03.102 --> 10:05.832
With you by his side
maybe a good king!

10:06.973 --> 10:09.737
He'll be just like his father
a tyrant and a butcher.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.433
I won't marry him!

10:20.920 --> 10:22.683
Then you better choose someone else.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.983
Because when he's king
it'll be too late to say no.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.524
Then don't make him king!

10:34.967 --> 10:35.763
Let me look at that.

10:35.901 --> 10:36.560
It's fine.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.192
Let me see it!

10:49.048 --> 10:50.913
I'm not getting any younger, Freya.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.852
I just want to make sure that
you're well looked after

10:55.221 --> 10:56.620
when I'm gone.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.219
I know, Father. I know.

11:00.359 --> 11:01.621
And

11:02.128 --> 11:04.824
if any one can make
Wulfric keep the peace,

11:05.798 --> 11:08.631
by the gods, it's you.

11:15.675 --> 11:20.305
I rule Herot and Freya rules me.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.038
I don't think so.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.881
And no queen of mine
will fight like a man.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.791
I will take care of you.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.294
She's like her mother.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.665
You'd do well to tread
more softly with her.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.437
There's nothing soft about her.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.844
Gunnar's village was sacked.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.676
What happened?

11:58.117 --> 11:59.106
I don't know.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.048
There were no bodies, nothing.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.519
Slavers?

12:05.157 --> 12:06.488
Too much blood.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.093
What about Gunnar?

12:09.328 --> 12:11.296
He's still trading with the Rus.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.227
He'll be back before the snow.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.429
He'll think it was us.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.427
It should've been.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.037
Was it?

12:25.778 --> 12:27.405
No.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.810
We caught a man
nearby in the woods.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.380
One of ours?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.813
Well, what tribe was he? Frankish, Rus?

12:36.956 --> 12:39.891
I don't know. But I'll find out.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.683
Well, do it quickly.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.924
It's war if you don't.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.404
I'll take those.

13:15.828 --> 13:16.920
Bring him

13:23.068 --> 13:24.558
So who are you, Outlander?

13:25.671 --> 13:27.298
I'd answer him, friend.

13:27.773 --> 13:28.637
Your name!

13:28.774 --> 13:34.610
My name is Kainan.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.477
Kainan? What kind of name is that?

13:37.616 --> 13:39.106
Where are you from?

13:39.852 --> 13:42.412
An Island to the north.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.147
Why did you attack Gunnar's village?

13:44.290 --> 13:45.450
I didn't attack anyone.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.683
Then why were you there?

13:46.826 --> 13:47.724
I was hunting.

13:47.860 --> 13:48.656
Hunting?

13:48.794 --> 13:49.818
Hunting what?

13:49.962 --> 13:51.259
That.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.228
A dragon

14:03.976 --> 14:05.034
Tell me! Why where you there?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.439
Where are your men?

14:06.579 --> 14:07.511
Told you.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.115
Don't lie to me.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.418
Stick with the dragons. I like that one.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.517
All right.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.124
I'll tell you.

14:21.193 --> 14:27.223
I was hunting... dragons.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.439
Not yet

15:24.823 --> 15:26.051
The prisoner's hurt.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.687
So are you, by the looks of it.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.054
And he needs looking after

15:33.232 --> 15:35.962
I've got work to do.
You clean up your own mess.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.538
To hell with it then.

15:45.177 --> 15:46.735
He dies, it's on your head.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.034
Bjorn!

16:52.878 --> 16:54.140
He needs looking after

16:59.518 --> 17:00.849
Let me pass.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.984
That's enough! Get out!

17:50.002 --> 17:51.492
What did he tell you?

17:51.804 --> 17:53.066
Nothing.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.270
Some lies about a dragon.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.041
But he's hiding something.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.245
Keep at him.

18:03.148 --> 18:04.945
I have to send riders to find Gunnar.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.450
He has to know that it wasn't us.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.146
He'll never believe us.
Not when he sees his village.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.983
We should kill him while
we still have the chance.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.157
Like your father would have done.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.521
And he would have been right.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.788
My father's dead because of Gunnar.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.524
Your father's dead
because he was a fool!

18:32.778 --> 18:34.837
You want to kill Gunnar.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.976
I can understand that.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.512
And you want to rule from here.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.620
I can understand that, too.

18:43.822 --> 18:48.589
But it's not your sword that
will make you king, nor Shield Hall.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.725
It's how you rule your own
head and heart.

18:55.200 --> 19:01.230
Until you understand that
then you'll never wear this.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.993
Water.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.297
Please.

19:52.391 --> 19:53.483
Thank you.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.762
Did you do what they're saying?

19:59.431 --> 20:01.331
Did you attack Gunnar's village?

20:03.435 --> 20:04.663
No.

20:19.084 --> 20:19.982
Bjorn!

20:59.891 --> 21:01.051
It's sharp.

21:02.461 --> 21:03.951
It's never sharp enough.

21:04.396 --> 21:04.953
If Gunnar comes tonight...

21:05.097 --> 21:08.294
If Gunnar comes tonight he'll stick
that blade right up your arse.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.302
...then you'll wish it wasn't so sharp.

21:31.723 --> 21:32.917
You smell that?

21:42.534 --> 21:43.831
Arn?

22:26.945 --> 22:28.105
The sentries are gone!

22:28.246 --> 22:30.806
It's Gunnar! Get to the walls!

22:45.230 --> 22:46.492
Where are they?!

22:48.633 --> 22:49.395
Is it raiders?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.195
Give me my blade, woman!

22:59.745 --> 23:00.609
They're inside the walls.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.145
Take your men, fan out!

23:02.280 --> 23:03.838
The rest with me!

23:41.386 --> 23:42.717
Gunnar!

25:09.007 --> 25:10.531
Moorwen!

25:34.099 --> 25:34.929
He's getting away!

25:35.066 --> 25:36.294
Get him out of here!

25:37.636 --> 25:38.603
Where is Gunnar?

25:38.737 --> 25:39.965
I don't know!

25:51.650 --> 25:53.880
What could have done this?

28:01.246 --> 28:03.874
Right, get up.
It was the demon, Mimir.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.949
Come to drag us down to Jotunheim

28:06.084 --> 28:07.847
and freeze us dead.

28:07.986 --> 28:10.750
Enough of your forest spirits, Unferth.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.852
It was Frankish raiders. Sure enough!

28:16.628 --> 28:17.458
They climbed over the walls.

28:17.595 --> 28:18.926
Then what, Boromir?

28:19.064 --> 28:20.031
We all saw Bjorn's body.

28:20.165 --> 28:21.564
He was clawed to death.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.463
It was an animal.
No!

28:23.601 --> 28:25.330
This is the work of Lucifer!

28:25.470 --> 28:29.031
Visited upon us because you
buried King Halga like a pagan...

28:29.174 --> 28:30.232
and not like a Christian!

28:30.375 --> 28:31.433
My father was a Viking.

28:31.576 --> 28:34.841
He worshiped Odin not some
woodworker nailed to a cross.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.514
And I'll be damned if it was
anything but a bear!

28:45.590 --> 28:49.651
First Gunnar, now us.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.225
Three of my men are missing
five are dead.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.367
May Odin keep them.

29:06.377 --> 29:10.711
So why don't you tell me
about your dragon?

29:13.184 --> 29:15.049
My people call it a Moorwen.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.384
A Moorwen?

29:18.156 --> 29:20.522
I've never even heard of such a thing.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.020
Believe me.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.389
The first time I saw one,

29:24.529 --> 29:26.520
I didn't know what I was looking at.

29:28.466 --> 29:30.991
It was just a smudge of
light in the darkness.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.562
It could have been anything.

29:34.806 --> 29:38.242
That's how it draws
its prey in, with light.

29:40.044 --> 29:41.409
Foxfire.

29:41.646 --> 29:45.673
It kills men, beasts, everything.

29:46.684 --> 29:48.914
And it smells like death.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.614
There's nothing like that here.

29:50.755 --> 29:52.484
Yes, there is.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.320
Because I brought it here.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.424
Silence!

30:00.765 --> 30:02.096
Leave him!

30:03.535 --> 30:04.729
Come here!

30:11.476 --> 30:14.104
You say you're responsible for this.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.542
Yes.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.971
It got on my ship, it killed my crew.

30:18.116 --> 30:19.708
Then we crashed here.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.119
I know you don't believe me...

30:22.253 --> 30:25.620
but this thing has carved out
a territory and you are in it.

30:32.397 --> 30:36.458
You think you can frighten us
with children's stories.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.432
This is no story.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.071
But whatever you think did this,

30:42.507 --> 30:44.532
you're going to hunt it down
aren't you?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.313
Take me with you.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.247
How am I supposed to
fight it like this?

30:56.387 --> 30:57.752
You're not.

30:58.489 --> 30:59.888
That one's yours.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.086
What do I do with it?

31:03.228 --> 31:04.593
Hey! What do I with it?

31:04.729 --> 31:06.094
Outlander.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.343
Enough! Mount up.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.514
How's your jaw?

32:01.619 --> 32:02.813
Your jaw!

32:03.154 --> 32:04.382
Freya?

32:06.724 --> 32:08.817
Here. Try some of this.

32:09.294 --> 32:13.663
Cure anything from a sword
in the guts to a broken heart.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.190
You shouldn't feel too bad.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.130
You see that?

32:19.270 --> 32:21.738
She once stuck me with a fork.

32:21.973 --> 32:25.340
It seems I got a little too
familiar when I was in me cups.

32:26.044 --> 32:28.808
Well, go on! Drink!

32:37.055 --> 32:38.249
Good, eh?

32:40.391 --> 32:40.982
What is it?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.353
What is it!

32:42.493 --> 32:44.393
What kind of backwater are you from?

32:44.529 --> 32:46.019
Some place far from here.

32:46.164 --> 32:47.062
For certain.

32:47.198 --> 32:51.191
Far off and sad that's
not tasted Herot mead.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.935
Boromir likes his drink.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.107
You know, Outlander...

33:02.480 --> 33:06.211
we trade in every direction
for a thousand miles.

33:06.951 --> 33:11.684
South, east and west, not north.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.558
There's nothing there.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.283
Maybe you haven't
looked far enough.

33:16.427 --> 33:18.019
Perhaps.

33:18.463 --> 33:23.059
But what's a man who lives so far
north doing in these seas?

33:23.634 --> 33:25.397
We have an outpost near here.

33:25.603 --> 33:29.699
And that's where this Moorwen
got on board your ship?

33:33.745 --> 33:34.837
Yes.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.746
And what it did to your village
it did to mine.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.514
We were taking the bodies
back for a burial.

33:41.986 --> 33:44.147
That's when it must
have gotten onboard.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.286
Hold up!

34:04.542 --> 34:06.100
Bear came this way.

34:06.944 --> 34:08.911
There's been a lot of
animals through here since.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.737
We should split up
try to find the main trail.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.440
That's a bad idea.

34:14.752 --> 34:16.242
We should stay together.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.719
We'll pair up.

34:18.856 --> 34:22.292
Wulfric, you take the Outlander.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.646
A bear wouldn't do this.

36:54.245 --> 36:55.507
It's here.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.020
Wulfric! Wait!

38:06.951 --> 38:08.543
Now that's a bear.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.157
Outlander!

38:24.835 --> 38:26.132
Take this sword.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.400
And your life, too.

38:29.674 --> 38:31.107
It's yours again.

38:44.455 --> 38:51.327
Wulfric! Wulfric!

39:42.646 --> 39:45.308
Kainan!

39:45.449 --> 39:49.909
Kainan! Kainan!

40:04.602 --> 40:05.569
Sit here!

40:05.703 --> 40:07.796
Be my guest tonight.

40:08.472 --> 40:12.135
Daughter! Kainan needs some drink.

40:14.178 --> 40:18.046
See, now you look like a Viking.

40:18.182 --> 40:19.615
Doesn't he, Freya?

40:23.721 --> 40:25.086
Perhaps.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.250
Nobody cooks this better
than my kitchen.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.563
Eat!

40:33.998 --> 40:39.061
There I was, running into
the cave ahead of everyone...

40:39.270 --> 40:42.569
when suddenly, out of nowhere
came the biggest...

40:42.706 --> 40:47.234
most vicious bear I've ever seen.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.744
He tore up two grown men...

40:49.880 --> 40:52.405
and was about to eat
the king himself...

40:52.550 --> 40:55.348
when the Outlander stuck
his sword in it.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.248
You see, the bear was there.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.722
No! There!

41:01.859 --> 41:06.296
And Rothgar was... Rothgar was here.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.629
What's this?

41:12.069 --> 41:16.165
Creeping into Shield Hall uninvited.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.331
Off you go!

41:17.475 --> 41:18.635
Wait!

41:18.776 --> 41:20.403
What's your name?

41:22.079 --> 41:23.706
Answer him, lad.

41:26.383 --> 41:28.943
Here. Are you hungry?

41:36.494 --> 41:40.260
He wants to see the sword
that killed the bear.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.033
No.

41:50.441 --> 41:53.604
I'll trade you for your name.

41:59.917 --> 42:01.316
Eric.

42:02.786 --> 42:04.219
Eric.

42:06.924 --> 42:10.724
A sword for a name.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.696
Just bring it back in one piece.

42:23.007 --> 42:25.703
His parents were killed
by raiders a year ago.

42:28.445 --> 42:29.810
The boy'll be fine.

42:30.447 --> 42:32.438
We take care of our own.

42:35.319 --> 42:38.880
Shields!

42:42.092 --> 42:43.992
Shields!

42:44.628 --> 42:46.425
Shields! it is.

42:49.133 --> 42:54.503
Shield! Shield! Shield!

43:14.792 --> 43:15.952
You!

43:20.364 --> 43:21.296
Kainan!

43:21.432 --> 43:22.763
You.

43:22.900 --> 43:31.000
Kainan! Kainan! Kainan!

43:44.888 --> 43:46.014
Up!

43:52.529 --> 43:55.225
Kainan! Kainan!

44:04.341 --> 44:05.433
What now?

44:05.576 --> 44:06.907
Follow me.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.799
The Outlander's good.

45:03.934 --> 45:06.494
Care to wager some gold on him?

45:07.371 --> 45:09.703
No one beats Wulfric at shields.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.180
Kainan!

45:41.071 --> 45:42.299
Now you try this.

46:00.257 --> 46:01.485
Oh hell.

46:01.959 --> 46:03.551
Are you ready for this, Boromir?

46:14.571 --> 46:15.697
I am now.

46:17.674 --> 46:18.606
Okay.

46:57.514 --> 46:58.742
Not bad.

47:47.965 --> 47:49.159
Sorry.

47:57.441 --> 47:58.237
Outlander, I wanted...

47:58.375 --> 47:59.637
Kainan.

47:59.776 --> 48:01.243
My name is Kainan.

48:01.745 --> 48:03.110
Kainan,

48:03.680 --> 48:05.739
I wanted to thank you for
bringing my father back to me.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.714
For saving his life.

48:11.822 --> 48:15.918
It happened so fast
I did it without thinking.

48:16.827 --> 48:18.294
Like when you hit me?

48:18.896 --> 48:20.386
Hit you?

48:22.599 --> 48:24.294
Yes, sorry about that.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.100
We're even now.

48:38.148 --> 48:39.809
All the women are talking about you.

48:42.386 --> 48:46.186
They say you're from a place
far beyond the ice.

48:47.891 --> 48:50.917
I heard one say from
the home of the gods.

48:52.396 --> 48:53.886
What do you think?

48:55.565 --> 48:57.192
I think...

48:58.335 --> 49:00.326
she was a little drunk.

49:07.044 --> 49:08.511
Freya!

49:09.646 --> 49:12.308
Everyone thinks that
bear killed your people.

49:13.150 --> 49:14.481
It didn't.

49:15.152 --> 49:17.416
It was the Moorwen and
it will come back.

49:33.370 --> 49:34.462
Get the others!

49:36.173 --> 49:37.435
It's Gunnar!

50:25.322 --> 50:26.516
Get out of here!

50:27.124 --> 50:28.455
Get out of here!

50:30.460 --> 50:31.791
Get out of here!

51:18.341 --> 51:19.933
Rothgar!

51:48.738 --> 51:50.797
It's over. We've lost!

51:50.941 --> 51:52.033
No!

51:53.743 --> 51:54.539
Let me go!

51:54.678 --> 51:56.202
Get your hands off me!

51:57.781 --> 51:59.009
Rothgar!

52:02.953 --> 52:05.080
The gate. Close the gate!

52:12.963 --> 52:14.328
Rothgar!

52:15.932 --> 52:18.696
Where are you
you bastard son of a bitch?

52:23.673 --> 52:25.038
Where's my wife?

52:26.843 --> 52:28.504
Where's my boy?

52:30.514 --> 52:33.210
You didn't even leave me their bodies.

52:37.521 --> 52:39.887
If it takes a thousand years

52:41.324 --> 52:45.192
I'll carve your heart out
of your rotting chest.

52:48.265 --> 52:49.994
Do you hear me?

53:04.948 --> 53:07.041
This is the man you want
to make peace with?

54:35.238 --> 54:36.569
Are you all right?

54:38.174 --> 54:39.334
I'm fine.

54:42.946 --> 54:44.106
That looks deep.

54:45.548 --> 54:46.810
Here let me clean it.

54:58.461 --> 54:59.758
What happened out there?

55:00.163 --> 55:01.494
Who was that?

55:01.698 --> 55:02.824
That was Gunnar.

55:03.233 --> 55:04.632
Gunnar?

55:04.968 --> 55:07.766
King Halga, Wulfric's father...

55:08.371 --> 55:11.340
called all the tribes together
for a raid on the Franks.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.131
Gunnar never showed.

55:13.276 --> 55:15.801
There was an ambush and
Halga was killed.

55:17.347 --> 55:19.747
So Wulfric thinks
Gunnar betrayed him.

55:21.284 --> 55:24.549
And Gunnar thinks his village
was destroyed in revenge.

55:25.955 --> 55:27.388
That's right.

55:28.391 --> 55:30.723
Wulfric is simple like his father.

55:31.795 --> 55:34.821
He'll send a party into
the trees just before dawn.

55:35.398 --> 55:37.958
And then attack from the main
gate first light.

55:43.573 --> 55:45.507
But I think he's in for a surprise.

56:25.782 --> 56:27.306
Gunnar said wait here.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.249
Aethril?

57:17.367 --> 57:19.597
Circle up. Circle up!

57:24.441 --> 57:26.602
Get Wulfric and Rothgar up here now!

57:32.549 --> 57:33.675
What's going on?

57:37.887 --> 57:39.252
Wulfric!

57:50.967 --> 57:52.400
Wait! Don't shoot!

57:52.535 --> 57:54.594
Hold your fire. We surrender.

57:54.737 --> 57:55.931
It's a trick.

57:56.172 --> 57:57.730
Archers!

58:00.343 --> 58:01.537
Ready!

58:06.516 --> 58:07.505
Fire!

58:07.650 --> 58:08.844
Wait!

58:12.822 --> 58:14.255
Hold your fire, you bastards!

58:14.390 --> 58:15.482
Wait!

58:25.635 --> 58:26.727
No!

58:30.773 --> 58:32.035
Open the gates!

58:36.546 --> 58:37.877
Wulfric! No!

58:38.815 --> 58:40.077
Look!

59:03.039 --> 59:06.338
Now that is not a bear.

59:13.082 --> 59:14.845
It was like hitting a stone wall.

59:14.984 --> 59:16.042
I hit it with all I had.

59:16.185 --> 59:17.982
Ran. Just like you ran from my father.

59:18.121 --> 59:19.986
I'll cut your tongue out, boy.
Stop!

59:20.123 --> 59:21.454
Both of you.

59:21.591 --> 59:23.752
That thing is still out there!

59:23.893 --> 59:25.258
The gods have cursed us all.

59:25.395 --> 59:26.919
We should leave this place while
we can still save our families.

59:27.063 --> 59:27.927
This is our home!

59:28.064 --> 59:29.929
We are not going to let
that thing chase us out!

59:30.066 --> 59:31.294
She's right! We're not leaving.

59:31.434 --> 59:33.994
We're going to hunt this thing
down and kill it like Vikings.

59:34.137 --> 59:35.695
Hunting won't work.

59:40.176 --> 59:41.905
You can't take it on in the open.

59:42.045 --> 59:42.909
It's too powerful.

59:43.046 --> 59:44.308
Well, what else is there?

59:44.447 --> 59:45.880
We trap it.

59:47.784 --> 59:49.752
Even if you do track it down,

59:49.986 --> 59:51.715
How are you going to kill it?

59:52.021 --> 59:54.216
Why are we even listening to him?
He's not one of us.

59:54.357 --> 59:55.756
That's right. I'm not.

59:55.892 --> 59:57.553
But you're wrong about this, Wulfric.

59:57.694 --> 01:00:00.390
Like you were wrong about and the bear.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.590
And you'll always be wrong until
you stop thinking with this.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.631
This is finished!

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.300
You're not one of us.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.340
The decision is ours.

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:16.136
However, I'm still your king.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.876
And my judgment is that
the Outlander is correct.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.415
We build the trap.

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:35.558
So,

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.560
where do we start?

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.968
Here...

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:48.302
And ending... here.

01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:58.815
What are you waiting for?

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:00.649
Dig!

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.940
The forge, what does it burn?

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.573
Wood.

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:26.146
What about the torches, the lamps?

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.749
Whale oil.

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.379
I'll need it.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:30.577
How much?

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.017
All of it.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.739
How's it coming?

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.877
Is it deep enough for you?

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:01.947
No.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.416
Four more feet.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.251
And when you got that...

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:08.118
I need two rows of postholes
running up both sides.

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.382
Post holes?

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:09.889
Yeah.

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:12.256
What do you need post holes for?

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:13.792
Posts.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.122
Posts.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.265
Posts.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:46.955
Are we done now?

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.154
Not yet.

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.731
Not yet? What's left?

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.594
Shields?

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:55.033
Shields.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.497
When this thing is over...

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.864
...there's a place here for you.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.867
Should you wish it.

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:57.487
You hungry?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.244
What about you?

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.815
I'll eat when you're finished.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.110
No.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.647
You sit.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:30.053
Thank you.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.403
I saw you talking to my father today.

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.606
What did he say?

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.379
He asked me to stay.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:57.943
What did you say?

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:03.948
Freya...

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:13.661
You don't even know
what kind of man I am.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:16.897
I know enough.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.638
No, you don't.

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:25.345
So, tell me.

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:33.588
Kainan?

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.821
My people are no different than yours.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.526
Hungry for land.

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.062
So when we found
an island we wanted,

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.029
we took it.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:05.413
It didn't matter that it already
belonged to something else...

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:11.284
Moorwens. Millions of them.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:14.455
But we wanted it.

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:19.366
After all, we told ourselves
they were nothing.

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:23.029
Just animals. Beasts.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:33.977
So we killed them all with fire.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.203
Those we missed, we hunted down.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.946
You obeyed your king's orders.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.515
You didn't have a choice.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:48.384
You always have a choice.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:57.158
Land that belonged to the Moorwens
now belonged to us.

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:14.276
As part of my pay I was given a place
for my family to live.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.651
And I thought I could forget
what I'd done to get it.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.982
Some things you can't
bury deep enough.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.725
Hey! What are you doing?

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:27.260
That plant, it stung me.
It what?

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:29.193
It stung me.

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.792
Let me show you something.
Stay right here, okay?

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:58.653
Kainan.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.458
The guns are up.

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.495
And there are none of them left.

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.825
You'll be safe.

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:13.133
I love you.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.742
I love you, too.

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:49.606
Three weeks later I got word that
one of the Moorwens had survived.

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:54.282
And it got in our compound
and killed everyone.

01:10:58.687 --> 01:10:59.984
It was the will of the gods.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:00.884
It was their destiny.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:02.547
There is no destiny.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.356
There is no gods.

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:10.760
It was just me.

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:14.832
And I failed them.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.737
I failed them.

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:37.020
This is a king's sword,

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:40.084
passed down from my ancestors.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:42.691
My father gave it to me...

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.526
and told me that one day

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.792
I would know the man to give it to.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.001
A good man.

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:06.349
If you truly believe that you
write the tale of your own life...

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.823
...then the end is up to you.

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.153
More arrows!

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.607
The gods be with you.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.680
Boromir, close the doors.

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.366
Open the gates!

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:43.948
You sure this will work?

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:51.120
That's what I thought.

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:58.052
Hold this.

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:21.174
Gods above...

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.561
Wait for my order!

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.020
What's your damn priest doing?

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:35.220
I command thee, Lucifer,

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.052
quit this place!

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.348
Ready!

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:21.901
Wulfric!

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:24.933
Hold your fire!

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:27.307
Shoot!

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:28.101
Take my hand!

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:28.800
Shoot!

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:31.344
Hold!
Take it now!

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.110
Fire!

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.155
By the gods!

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.465
Freya?

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:29.202
Freya!

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:31.698
Freya!

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.038
Moorwen!

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:09.003
Kainan

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.031
There's another one!

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.243
Kainan!

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:32.680
everyone's leaving.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.255
Eric, it's not safe here anymore.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.799
Everyone's going to the boats.

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.091
You need to go, too.

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.426
But, I want to stay here with you.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.333
You'll come back soon.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:53.905
Everyone will.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.607
You promise?

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:04.912
I promise.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.757
Your boots, do you want them back?

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:48.356
No. They're his now.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:51.991
What are you going to do?

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.196
You're king now.

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.803
King of what? This?

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:02.100
This... and them...

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:05.942
Whatever Herot becomes tomorrow...

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.539
will be because of
what you do right now.

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:12.710
Let's go kill this thing...

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.154
...together.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.211
You're daft!

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:45.319
We're not going down there.

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.011
That's where it came from.

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:48.520
That's where we're going.

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:50.982
But we don't know how to kill it yet.

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.184
We need better weapons.

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:55.353
No. We need better metal.

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:58.097
Boromir, get the forge ready.

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:02.161
Unferth, Olaf, get the torches
and the ropes.

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.695
Let's go.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.206
I'm coming with you.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:10.806
No you're not.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:15.677
That thing killed my father and
destroyed my home.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.307
I'm coming with you.

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.818
This is where your ship went down?

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:28.729
That's right.

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.166
In a lake?

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:41.440
Don't ask.

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:39.834
Kainan?

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:11.825
Freya?

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.167
Freya?

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:21.734
Where's Freya?

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:24.172
Just get the metal and make the swords!

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.641
Damn.

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.652
What kind of metal is this?

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:58.945
King's sword again.

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:32.005
You're...
I know. Daft.

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:01.957
Let's go.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:33.083
Where's it coming from?

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:38.657
It's beneath us.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.077
God.

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.418
I slipped.

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.099
Let's keep moving.

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:38.583
Ain't nothing down there.

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.795
Unferth!
Wulfric!

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:56.366
Can you see anything?

01:32:57.939 --> 01:32:58.837
Over here!

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:27.683
Boromir!

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:55.648
We'll drink together again, Kainan.

01:34:58.459 --> 01:34:59.721
Herot mead.

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.929
Best in the world.

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:21.180
No!

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:25.008
Kainan!

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.480
Freya! Freya...!

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.923
Kainan!

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:37.824
That way!

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:41.199
Freya!

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:43.828
I'm here.

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:29.542
Freya, Freya.

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:39.918
Freya!

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.563
Freya. Squeeze through!

01:36:50.671 --> 01:36:51.228
Squeeze through!

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:52.532
Too tight.

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:55.201
Take it!

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:18.190
Freya, calm down, calm down.

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:26.003
By all the gods.

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:51.598
Move!

01:38:24.298 --> 01:38:25.424
Over there!

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.345
Get her out of here!

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:49.414
Come on!

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.292
Swing me!

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:27.617
Wulfric!

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:24.926
Is it dead?

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:28.692
Yes.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.879
I wanted this for so long.

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:49.546
At least I got to wear it for a day.

01:43:54.494 --> 01:43:56.860
I hope you wear it for
longer than I did.

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.725
We could have been friends.

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:04.130
We are friends.

01:44:49.283 --> 01:44:51.148
Eric.

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:52.407
Up here!

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:54.620
Up here!

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:56.756
Up here!

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.357
Up here!

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:16.006
You wait here for the others.

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:19.102
I've got something to do.

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:22.742
You're not coming back, are you?

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:31.322
In the year of Four Kings,

01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:35.464
Rothgar and Wulfric were laid to rest.

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:38.700
Heroes in the war against the Moorwens.

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:58.921
And Kainan, once a stranger to us...

01:49:59.459 --> 01:50:01.086
...became king.

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:06.758
He took for himself a wife... and a boy,

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.266
who became as his own son.

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:47.101
But only I knew his secret.

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:51.208
That the gods had sent us Kainan.

01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:56.539
And when it came time
to return to them...

01:50:58.618 --> 01:51:02.213
...he chose to stay with us instead.
