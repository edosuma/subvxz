00:34.151 --> 00:35.418
Thomas.

00:55.010 --> 00:57.611
What the hell was that?

00:58.065 --> 00:59.512
Why are we stopped?

01:56.666 --> 01:58.502
Excuse me.

03:09.963 --> 03:14.592
Come on now.
Get in here.

03:16.011 --> 03:17.929
Let me help you.

03:20.957 --> 03:23.185
We gonna make them Injuns pay

03:23.426 --> 03:26.905
for derailing this train.

03:27.030 --> 03:31.743
Right away, I want you to get
back to Hell on Wheels,

03:31.868 --> 03:34.947
rouse those useless
drunken Calvary Men.

03:35.113 --> 03:36.504
Yes, sir.

03:37.032 --> 03:39.451
Oh, and get Bohannon.
I want him to go with them.

03:39.675 --> 03:44.388
Mr. Bohannon is a fugitive, sir.

03:44.513 --> 03:46.424
A fugitive?

03:46.549 --> 03:47.626
From what?
From whom?

03:47.792 --> 03:50.594
There was an incident in the saloon.

03:50.719 --> 03:53.363
Mr. Bohannon killed one of our men

03:53.488 --> 03:55.551
as we was attempting to hang a negro.

03:55.717 --> 03:58.596
You were hanging
a negro in the saloon?

03:59.027 --> 04:00.604
Yeah, he was caught
with a white woman.

04:00.729 --> 04:01.640
- A white woman?
- Yeah.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.441
- You mean one of the whores?
- Yes, sir.

04:04.566 --> 04:08.545
You were going to hang
a negro for screwing a whore?

04:08.670 --> 04:11.442
It seemed appropriate.

04:12.708 --> 04:15.285
Those freed slaves work twice as hard

04:15.410 --> 04:17.988
for half the pay.
Have they deserted us?

04:18.113 --> 04:22.286
Ay, only the one they was hangin'.

04:22.452 --> 04:26.063
Bohannon cut him loose
and they rode off.

04:26.188 --> 04:28.250
I sent a posse in pursuit.

04:28.416 --> 04:32.003
You have run off the man
I wish to pursue the savages.

04:32.128 --> 04:34.423
Nice work, Mr. Gundersen.

04:52.915 --> 04:57.452
Ah, I am unarmed, please!

04:59.789 --> 05:03.118
I beg for your mercy.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.300
Uhh.

05:30.687 --> 05:31.730
Settle down, boy.

05:31.896 --> 05:32.967
Aah!

05:33.092 --> 05:35.109
Hold still.

05:44.537 --> 05:45.953
Aah!

05:46.119 --> 05:48.317
Mr. Bohannon...

05:48.442 --> 05:49.609
Aah!

05:58.590 --> 05:59.796
Aah!

05:59.921 --> 06:01.802
Mr. Bohannon!

06:01.968 --> 06:04.967
That's enough.

06:05.092 --> 06:07.725
I need to see you back in
Hell on Wheels right away.

06:34.678 --> 06:36.031
Don't.

06:36.156 --> 06:38.297
It's the engineer, he's badly burned.

06:53.907 --> 06:56.857
What kind of monster would do this?

07:19.504 --> 07:21.242
Oh, my God.

07:21.367 --> 07:24.343
All is lost.
All is lost.

07:24.509 --> 07:25.594
Don't say that.

07:29.710 --> 07:34.257
I was a fool to believe that
love could prevail over hate.

07:34.382 --> 07:36.939
No. You have to believe,

07:37.218 --> 07:39.483
now more than ever.

07:39.721 --> 07:41.360
Pray with us, Father.

07:44.559 --> 07:45.823
Pray?

07:51.732 --> 07:55.401
God has abandoned
this terrible place.

08:07.515 --> 08:09.429
Blood is God here.

08:11.353 --> 08:13.892
Just as it was in Kansas

08:14.122 --> 08:17.734
and in Babylon in the old book.

08:17.859 --> 08:21.572
As it always was...
And always will be.

08:21.697 --> 08:25.195
No, Reverend, please.

08:25.361 --> 08:29.012
They're sending soldiers
to kill your people, Joseph.

08:29.137 --> 08:32.315
I'm sorry I failed you.

08:32.440 --> 08:36.498
My whole life has become
a ridiculous failure.

08:36.664 --> 08:38.778
My whole life.

08:40.881 --> 08:44.594
Oh, Jesus.

08:44.719 --> 08:46.931
My Jesus Christ!

08:48.558 --> 08:50.568
My Jesus.

08:53.863 --> 08:55.976
Papa?

08:56.142 --> 08:57.867
What's wrong?

08:59.737 --> 09:00.647
Ruth.

09:03.941 --> 09:04.985
Father?

09:07.744 --> 09:09.054
Father?

09:09.179 --> 09:10.032
Father?

09:11.615 --> 09:14.150
Father? Father?

09:20.926 --> 09:23.570
I didn't sign on
to be no Indian fighter.

09:23.695 --> 09:26.089
You didn't sign on at all.

09:26.255 --> 09:29.144
I spared your neck from
the noose because you told me

09:29.269 --> 09:32.596
that building a railroad
was like fighting a war.

09:32.873 --> 09:36.185
This is the war, Mr. Bohannon.

09:36.310 --> 09:39.289
Are you telling me you want me
to bring this Johnny Reb along?

09:39.414 --> 09:41.396
Yes.
No.

09:41.562 --> 09:45.385
Hell, no. I don't
take orders from you.

09:46.025 --> 09:48.737
But you do take orders from
my good friend general Dodge.

09:48.903 --> 09:53.283
You are aware that he worked for
me before the war, aren't you?

09:53.449 --> 09:55.994
I can always send a telegram
if you don't believe me.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.773
What about him?

09:58.898 --> 10:01.709
This is Joseph black moon.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.503
He is willing to lead you
to his father's camp.

10:04.669 --> 10:06.296
Now, why the hell would he do that?

10:06.573 --> 10:08.616
Joseph will negotiate with his father

10:08.741 --> 10:12.010
for the hand over of the renegades
who caused the derailment...

10:12.245 --> 10:14.805
For a guarantee.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.599
No harm comes to the
women and children.

10:25.260 --> 10:28.026
What kind of soldier
do you think I am, huh?

10:28.192 --> 10:32.197
I don't know. That's why
I want your guarantee.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.920
So, it's agreed?

10:41.045 --> 10:46.378
Agreed. But I don't
like it one damn bit.

10:51.956 --> 10:54.625
Thank you, Joseph.
You may go.

10:58.964 --> 11:01.074
What you asking me to do here, sir?

11:01.199 --> 11:04.144
We can't risk that hothead
Griggs starting a war

11:04.269 --> 11:06.606
with the Cheyenne right now,
we haven't enough troops.

11:07.038 --> 11:10.951
But I cannot allow them to
continue to terrorize my railroad.

11:11.076 --> 11:13.322
- You want revenge?
- I want justice.

11:14.646 --> 11:16.366
Different words for the same thing.

11:19.885 --> 11:22.831
Kill the renegades, Mr. Bohannon.

11:29.979 --> 11:32.189
Whatcha doing back here?

11:32.314 --> 11:34.525
Lovely to see you, too.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.995
What happened to England, huh?

11:37.120 --> 11:40.031
I got a taste of England
when I went to Chicago.

11:40.156 --> 11:41.785
Must have tasted pretty bad

11:41.910 --> 11:43.935
for you to come back here
and take up with the likes of him.

11:44.193 --> 11:46.761
I am not taking up with him.

11:47.063 --> 11:48.439
Lily?

11:48.564 --> 11:49.941
If you say so.

11:50.066 --> 11:51.499
Lily!

11:54.337 --> 11:57.574
I am not a kept woman if
that's what you're implying.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.384
So, you're trading
in them satin sheets

11:59.509 --> 12:01.244
for a place out here in
the muck with the rest of us peons?

12:01.410 --> 12:03.121
Lily, it's time for lunch.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.159
Yeah, I'll take that as a no.

12:07.284 --> 12:09.118
Mr. Bohannon...

12:10.487 --> 12:13.215
Has anyone ever told you what
an insufferable ass you are?

12:13.381 --> 12:16.293
Yeah.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.432
All right, boys,
let's get this finished.

12:26.638 --> 12:29.850
Hey, that must be some fine tail

12:29.975 --> 12:32.143
if you're willin' to risk
your neck twice for it.

12:33.312 --> 12:35.523
Things is different this time.

12:35.648 --> 12:37.759
Yeah, well, look here,

12:37.884 --> 12:40.861
Durant wants me to ride
out with them Yankees

12:40.986 --> 12:42.202
and kill the Indians
what derailed the train.

12:42.368 --> 12:44.031
Them blue coats get to taking scalps,

12:44.156 --> 12:45.497
they liable to cut
your rebel hair, too.

12:45.663 --> 12:47.707
I know it. That's why
I'm asking you to ride with me.

12:47.873 --> 12:50.043
You only asking because
you still think I owe you.

12:50.209 --> 12:53.473
No. Our account's square.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.742
I'm asking you 'cause I trust you.

12:56.867 --> 12:59.386
Right now you're all I got.

13:01.104 --> 13:03.115
No shit.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.308
Walking boss need me.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.232
All right then.
I need to visit in here first.

13:13.617 --> 13:16.686
Don't stay too long
just to impress me.

13:22.359 --> 13:23.910
Hey!

13:25.196 --> 13:26.788
Pull up your britches and get out.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.676
Give him his money back.

13:30.801 --> 13:32.979
Don't you come in here
running off my business.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.838
Woman, I am your business.

13:35.004 --> 13:36.256
Oh, is that so?

13:36.422 --> 13:38.241
Yeah, it is.

13:38.549 --> 13:41.887
Well, give me your dang
dollar and let's get to it.

13:42.053 --> 13:44.523
So, I gotta pay you
before we start now?

13:44.648 --> 13:46.057
Yeah, that's right.

13:46.223 --> 13:47.827
'Cause I figure you'll
get yourself killed

13:47.952 --> 13:49.436
before we even get started.

13:49.602 --> 13:52.724
Uh-uh, Toole the one that
got himself killed.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.230
Oh... what...

14:00.399 --> 14:04.278
So are you some kinda
dangerous gunslinger now?

14:04.403 --> 14:05.494
Is that it?

14:05.660 --> 14:06.981
Maybe.

14:07.106 --> 14:09.831
I'm fixin' to be
an Injun fighter, too.

14:10.342 --> 14:11.609
Get out of my crib.

14:11.957 --> 14:13.543
What?
You heard me.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.089
I don't want no dead man's trade.

14:16.214 --> 14:20.027
Last I saw you, you barely
escaped a neck stretchin',

14:20.152 --> 14:22.430
and you ride on outta
here and I figured

14:22.555 --> 14:24.598
for certain they got you killed.

14:24.723 --> 14:26.200
Now you come back,

14:26.325 --> 14:28.725
traipsin' on in here
like you own the place?

14:29.228 --> 14:31.728
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

14:33.232 --> 14:37.010
I am happy to see you, idiot.

14:37.135 --> 14:38.401
I just said so.

14:43.741 --> 14:46.577
Now, gimme that damn dollar.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.763
How's your father?

15:07.032 --> 15:08.675
Very weak.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.685
You'll have to tend to him.

15:11.937 --> 15:13.447
Where are you going?

15:13.572 --> 15:15.772
I'm going to help
them find my brother.

15:17.877 --> 15:19.776
Your own brother?

15:19.942 --> 15:23.280
He has to be stopped
before he starts a war.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.910
Be careful... Joseph.

16:23.039 --> 16:24.382
Will you just look at that?

16:27.314 --> 16:30.305
An Injun, a nigger, and a Greyback.

16:30.580 --> 16:33.558
We got ourselves a rainbow, boys.

16:38.555 --> 16:39.731
Mount up.

16:52.969 --> 16:54.329
Hyah!

17:24.335 --> 17:27.045
There's no reason to panic, Lily.

17:27.170 --> 17:29.715
I'm not, Thomas.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.864
I'm simply moving out.

17:35.412 --> 17:38.412
But... where will you go?

17:38.578 --> 17:42.161
I still have our tent,
Robert's and mine.

17:42.286 --> 17:43.796
I'll find a spot.

17:43.921 --> 17:46.499
Are you mad?

17:46.624 --> 17:48.422
Living amongst that rabble?

17:49.088 --> 17:50.971
And we're under a threat
of an Indian attack.

17:51.096 --> 17:53.440
It's too dangerous.
I won't have it.

17:53.565 --> 17:55.554
That's not your decision to make.

17:55.835 --> 18:00.893
Oh. I see.

18:03.643 --> 18:08.400
I thought it significant that you
chose to come back here with me,

18:08.948 --> 18:12.029
but... I see I was mistaken.

18:12.195 --> 18:15.731
I came back because I believe in you.

18:15.856 --> 18:18.391
I believe in this railroad.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.039
Together we can get it done.

18:22.205 --> 18:25.751
But not together.

18:29.337 --> 18:31.590
I'm sorry.

18:31.756 --> 18:35.218
Hmm. So am I.

18:35.343 --> 18:40.558
Taking you in...
Comforting you,

18:40.683 --> 18:44.361
salving the memory
of Robert at every turn.

18:44.486 --> 18:46.730
And for that I am eternally grateful.

18:46.855 --> 18:52.027
Please, Thomas... can
we end this amiably?

18:58.534 --> 19:01.245
You played me like
a fiddle, didn't you?

19:02.671 --> 19:04.749
Right under my nose...

19:04.874 --> 19:07.518
Where I could see you,
hear your voice,

19:07.643 --> 19:09.211
smell you every day.

19:15.385 --> 19:16.677
I should go.

19:17.220 --> 19:21.557
Ahem. Could you have Henri
help me with my things?

19:23.060 --> 19:24.727
No.

19:26.063 --> 19:28.565
Carry them yourself.

19:50.335 --> 19:52.088
Hold!

20:09.979 --> 20:15.194
We follow Little Bear Creek North
for a day and then head West.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.321
How many in your father's camp?

20:18.446 --> 20:21.533
50, maybe 60.

20:21.749 --> 20:23.826
Mostly women and children.

20:23.951 --> 20:25.329
Hmm.

20:26.955 --> 20:28.999
Where are all the braves?

20:29.124 --> 20:31.168
Out hunting.

20:31.293 --> 20:33.128
And what about this Pawnee killer?

20:34.464 --> 20:36.548
My father will know where he is.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.218
He better.

20:44.908 --> 20:46.642
Think that was smart tellin' him

20:46.808 --> 20:49.188
there's only women and
children at that camp?

20:49.313 --> 20:52.123
What do you mean?

20:52.248 --> 20:54.775
What if your father don't
give up Pawnee killer?

20:56.986 --> 20:59.863
Lieutenant Griggs
gave me his guarantee.

21:00.155 --> 21:02.866
So the white man gave
you his word, huh?

21:12.602 --> 21:13.543
Lieutenant?

21:14.804 --> 21:15.796
How we doing?

21:16.105 --> 21:18.173
Fine.

21:18.408 --> 21:21.176
Is that a Confederate Sabre
you got on your belt there?

21:21.342 --> 21:24.263
Ha ha ha.
Yes, it is.

21:25.715 --> 21:26.890
Where'd you get it?

21:27.116 --> 21:29.643
Antietam.

21:29.809 --> 21:31.687
Spoils of victory.

21:33.456 --> 21:35.065
You call Sharpsburg a victory?

21:35.231 --> 21:41.363
Antietam. And yeah, I do,
a glorious one.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.632
Mount up!

22:23.173 --> 22:25.324
That'll be 6 bits.

22:25.575 --> 22:28.160
6 bits?

22:28.412 --> 22:32.525
75 cents, unless, uh...

22:32.650 --> 22:35.227
Unless you got
something else in mind.

22:35.352 --> 22:36.168
OK.

22:36.387 --> 22:39.254
What are you doing?

22:39.420 --> 22:42.035
You can put it on my account.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.504
All right, Eva. I'll be
back for it later.

22:44.629 --> 22:47.387
You know where I'll be. Now fly.

22:52.636 --> 22:54.227
Thank you.

22:54.393 --> 22:56.305
I'll pay you back.

22:56.896 --> 22:57.716
When?

22:57.841 --> 23:03.421
I, uh, I have a small purse of...

23:03.546 --> 23:05.624
Of coins somewhere.

23:05.749 --> 23:08.408
Yeah, don't worry about it for now.

23:08.574 --> 23:11.328
First thing I'd do...
Is get you a carpenter

23:11.494 --> 23:12.721
to lay you some floor boards.

23:12.846 --> 23:15.267
Otherwise, you'll be saying
hello to Mr. trench foot.

23:15.392 --> 23:17.803
I'm well acquainted with trench foot.

23:17.928 --> 23:20.907
I have spent a year
in the wilderness.

23:21.032 --> 23:25.445
I reckon you're a good sight tougher
than you look, ain't you, Mrs. Bell?

23:25.570 --> 23:26.979
Please. Lily.

23:27.104 --> 23:28.547
All right then, Lily...

23:28.672 --> 23:32.451
I'd still suggest you puttin'
in them floor boards, though.

23:32.576 --> 23:34.267
'Course I had to throw my leg

23:34.433 --> 23:38.397
over that cross-eyed carpenter
twice before he got mine right.

23:46.455 --> 23:49.699
Tell us about your glorious
victory at Sharpsburg, lieutenant.

23:55.465 --> 23:57.800
Antietam it is then.

24:03.140 --> 24:07.787
I was with the 51st Pennsylvania.

24:07.912 --> 24:10.303
Me and my boys
took the Burnside Bridge.

24:10.469 --> 24:15.183
We softened them Rebs up with
a light howitzer from the East Bank.

24:15.349 --> 24:18.832
Then we stormed that bridge
like hounds from hell.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.148
Shoulda seen them Greybacks run.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.859
Ha ha. Yes, sir.

24:24.096 --> 24:27.154
Them boys got the skinny end
of the horn that day.

24:29.768 --> 24:32.325
I was on the other side
of the bridge that day.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.079
Is that so?

24:38.276 --> 24:39.777
Yep.

24:40.945 --> 24:44.588
You want to know why we retreated?

24:44.754 --> 24:47.794
We was out of ammunition...

24:47.919 --> 24:49.885
From killin' Yankees.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.466
Now, don't get me wrong,

24:52.591 --> 24:56.495
they were some brave men. Brave men.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.141
General McClellan might
just as well have been

24:59.266 --> 25:01.410
sending 'em up
against a firing squad.

25:01.535 --> 25:07.649
They kept chargin'
and... we kept shootin',

25:07.774 --> 25:10.447
like fish in a bloody barrel.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.388
Time we was done,

25:14.513 --> 25:17.496
there was a bridge of bodies
'cross that river.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.661
Yeah.

25:19.786 --> 25:22.787
That must have been when
you finally come across.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.171
When all the killin' was done.

25:26.337 --> 25:29.633
Yeah.

25:29.799 --> 25:33.175
We must've put down
500 Yankees that day.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.468
So.

25:37.571 --> 25:40.307
You want to call that
a glorious victory...

25:41.936 --> 25:42.979
You go ahead.

25:46.647 --> 25:47.984
500...

25:49.183 --> 25:50.526
A thousand...

25:50.651 --> 25:51.696
10,000.

25:51.862 --> 25:54.697
It doesn't matter.

25:54.822 --> 25:56.535
Hey!

25:56.701 --> 25:58.370
Hey.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.204
We won.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.710
Ha ha.
And you lost.

26:05.876 --> 26:10.257
And I got the sword
right here to prove it.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.271
Yeah.

26:15.261 --> 26:16.440
Well...

26:17.475 --> 26:18.818
I guess I'm just
gonna have to take it

26:18.943 --> 26:20.153
off of you and shove
it up your ass, then.

26:20.278 --> 26:21.643
Yeah. Is that so?

26:22.947 --> 26:24.062
Listen to me.

26:25.616 --> 26:27.023
Listen to me.

26:27.618 --> 26:30.954
Sometimes you got to bite
the tongue and just take it.

26:56.768 --> 26:57.738
Jesus.

26:57.863 --> 27:00.107
Get up! Hey, hey, get up!

27:00.232 --> 27:01.442
Jensen!

27:03.232 --> 27:04.193
Jensen!

27:04.359 --> 27:05.870
Jensen!

27:39.507 --> 27:41.104
Oh, sweet Jesus.

28:02.195 --> 28:03.862
They took the horses.

28:05.631 --> 28:08.309
Damn it to hell.

28:08.434 --> 28:09.883
That damned father
of yours is pretty clever,

28:10.049 --> 28:11.646
I'll give him that much.

28:11.771 --> 28:13.303
My father had nothing
to do with this.

28:13.469 --> 28:16.418
It was my brother.

28:16.543 --> 28:18.387
Your brother?

28:18.512 --> 28:20.555
This is his work.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.158
What we saw out there, too.

28:23.283 --> 28:24.860
This bloody renegade is your brother

28:24.985 --> 28:27.029
and you expect me to act
fairly with your father?

28:27.154 --> 28:30.237
Hey! We got more important problems,

28:30.403 --> 28:32.072
as in we got no horses.

28:32.238 --> 28:33.602
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

28:33.727 --> 28:35.337
We need to turn
around and go back.

28:35.462 --> 28:38.274
The plan's unchanged.
We march into the village.

28:38.399 --> 28:42.457
March? Are you crazy or just stupid?

28:42.623 --> 28:45.215
You are welcome
to retreat, Mr. Bohannon.

28:45.340 --> 28:48.551
We don't need you.
Let's move out.

28:48.676 --> 28:51.010
Off the reel, gentlemen.

28:54.594 --> 28:55.890
We need to go back.

28:56.015 --> 28:57.459
Following this guy's
gonna be suicide.

28:57.584 --> 29:00.995
No. We split up,
we'll be easier targets.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.228
It's what my brother wants.

29:11.631 --> 29:14.323
Hey. Hey!

29:14.489 --> 29:17.034
I need to know
where you stand right now.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.869
How you mean?

29:19.035 --> 29:21.317
Pawnee killer's fighting
a rear guard action,

29:21.442 --> 29:22.719
trying to buy some
time for his village,

29:22.844 --> 29:24.166
which means they ain't left yet.

29:24.332 --> 29:26.555
What if we get there and
them Injuns still here?

29:27.082 --> 29:29.359
Griggs ain't gonna be in no
talkin' mood, that's for sure.

29:29.484 --> 29:32.007
Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna
kill no women and no children.

29:32.173 --> 29:33.953
You just be ready.

29:34.258 --> 29:38.323
We might end up fighting them blue
coats instead of the Cheyenne.

29:57.623 --> 29:59.624
Father?

30:00.792 --> 30:02.960
I brought you some soup.

30:16.310 --> 30:19.896
Mother told me this was
always your one true love.

30:22.483 --> 30:27.863
I was only little...
But I remember the screaming at night.

30:27.988 --> 30:31.992
I remember the bruises
on her face in the morning.

30:36.764 --> 30:40.041
After you left,
she was always afraid you'd come back...

30:41.837 --> 30:45.006
But never stopped praying you would.

30:47.844 --> 30:50.427
She never stopped loving you.

30:57.354 --> 30:59.936
Have you nothing to say?

31:01.358 --> 31:04.193
Leave me alone.

31:05.261 --> 31:09.612
No. You're the one
who leaves, remember?

31:11.300 --> 31:14.469
Here. Let me.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.808
Here, drink it.

31:29.820 --> 31:32.343
I am not my mother.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.994
I'm not afraid of you.

32:57.506 --> 33:00.851
What the hell are you up to, son?

33:00.976 --> 33:02.120
What do you mean?

33:02.245 --> 33:03.888
This is just a different
bend in the same river.

33:04.013 --> 33:05.424
Skirted it twice, now
back out and back in.

33:05.549 --> 33:07.159
The Pawnee killer would have
had time to tell your father

33:07.284 --> 33:08.815
about the derailment by now.

33:08.981 --> 33:11.631
You're just buying time for
your village to escape, ain't ya?

33:11.756 --> 33:12.694
What do you care?

33:12.957 --> 33:14.533
You gonna get the rest of us killed

33:14.658 --> 33:16.281
out here leadin' us in circles.

33:16.447 --> 33:17.824
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

33:18.061 --> 33:21.672
So you never intended to go
after Pawnee killer, did you?

33:21.797 --> 33:23.774
That's not true.

33:23.899 --> 33:26.207
I just wanted to make sure
my family was safe first.

33:33.608 --> 33:34.549
Hey!

33:34.715 --> 33:37.343
Why the hell you dragging ass?
We need to stick together.

33:40.721 --> 33:41.925
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire!

33:42.050 --> 33:44.058
You're just wasting ammunition.

33:46.088 --> 33:48.532
Why ain't they attacking us?

33:48.657 --> 33:50.434
They will.

33:50.559 --> 33:52.327
Sooner or later.

34:04.673 --> 34:06.583
This is my favorite day of the week

34:06.708 --> 34:09.409
other than Monday when
I give my patooty a rest.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.277
Hey, don't be shy, deuce.

34:13.614 --> 34:14.822
Hello.

34:14.947 --> 34:15.672
Oh.

34:16.283 --> 34:17.449
Ohh.

34:21.121 --> 34:24.033
The ladies call me deuce...

34:24.158 --> 34:26.516
Because I got two of 'em.

34:26.683 --> 34:31.465
Ha ha.
Thank you... deuce.

34:42.176 --> 34:44.311
Hello.

34:57.156 --> 35:02.178
Everybody stares at my
tattoos... but nobody asks.

35:02.344 --> 35:04.997
And yeah, it don't wipe off.

35:06.167 --> 35:09.060
Yes, I...I heard you
were captured by Indians.

35:09.704 --> 35:11.815
Yavapai.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.185
Come upon us from the grass.

35:14.310 --> 35:16.354
It was a sunny day.

35:16.479 --> 35:19.356
They hacked up my mom
and dad, scalped 'em.

35:19.481 --> 35:22.993
Raped my little sister
and smashed her brains out with rocks.

35:23.118 --> 35:24.325
You gonna eat that?

35:25.788 --> 35:27.956
No, please.

35:32.629 --> 35:34.294
But I was lucky.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.004
Had the pox.

35:36.170 --> 35:39.178
They wouldn't touch me.
Traded me off to some Mojave.

35:39.303 --> 35:43.683
They was a cake walk compared to
what the Yavapai would have been.

35:43.808 --> 35:48.154
I have these terrible nightmares...

35:48.279 --> 35:50.281
About the Indian I killed.

35:50.559 --> 35:53.493
It's because his spirit's wandering.

35:53.618 --> 35:55.356
It's reaching out to you.

35:55.522 --> 35:59.198
Yes. And in the dream he...

35:59.323 --> 36:02.280
His cold hands clutch at my ankles.

36:02.446 --> 36:03.836
Don't let him get you.

36:03.961 --> 36:06.784
He's trying to drag you onto
the path to the dead world.

36:07.064 --> 36:09.040
It seems so real when it happens.

36:09.165 --> 36:11.289
It is real.

36:12.769 --> 36:15.271
When a woman kills a brave...

36:16.440 --> 36:19.047
It invites big magic.

36:20.545 --> 36:22.612
specially a white woman.

36:42.861 --> 36:45.239
If the Indians don't
attack us tonight,

36:45.405 --> 36:46.991
I want to start work again tomorrow.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.185
Mr. Durant, Bohannon is a killer.

36:50.310 --> 36:52.921
I can prove it. Look at these
papers I found in his tent.

36:53.046 --> 36:57.458
Right now Mr. Bohannon is hunting
the Indians who attacked us.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.060
Your job is to get
the men back to work.

36:59.185 --> 37:01.820
Ya, ya. In Washington, ya?

37:02.422 --> 37:05.099
Now in Washington he killed. Huh?

37:05.224 --> 37:08.803
Now, Johnson knew he killed,
so he killed Johnson.

37:08.928 --> 37:10.723
Mr. Gundersen.
Hmm?

37:10.889 --> 37:14.610
We will post a relay
of sentries out to the cut.

37:14.735 --> 37:17.647
Arm everyone.
The work must continue.

37:17.772 --> 37:21.485
No. He is not done killing, ya?

37:21.610 --> 37:23.053
Now, look at this.

37:23.178 --> 37:25.823
He's looking for others among
us. Look at these names.

37:25.948 --> 37:30.495
Listen to me,
half the men out there are killers.

37:30.620 --> 37:32.297
Half of them are accomplices.

37:32.422 --> 37:34.789
They are all afraid of Bohannon.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.584
He is an agent of progress,

37:39.162 --> 37:42.339
an asset to me in this endeavor, hmm?

37:42.464 --> 37:44.275
Whatever his motivations.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.845
Now, you will feed
this fantasy of revenge

37:47.970 --> 37:49.637
into the stove.

37:49.803 --> 37:51.214
Tomorrow, God willing,

37:51.339 --> 37:53.891
we will resume work on my railroad.

37:54.057 --> 37:55.185
Ya.

37:55.310 --> 37:57.311
Mr. Durant.

37:59.805 --> 38:04.135
It's a long walk through Indian
territory to Sweden, Mr. Gundersen.

38:05.861 --> 38:07.363
Sweden?

38:21.839 --> 38:24.441
I am from Norway.

38:25.943 --> 38:28.278
I am Norwegian.

40:11.399 --> 40:13.000
Lily?

40:18.072 --> 40:19.272
Lily?

41:32.614 --> 41:35.762
They've gone.

41:40.021 --> 41:42.366
Looks like we just missed 'em, sir.

41:42.491 --> 41:45.035
You son of a bitch.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.825
You knew this was gonna happen.

41:46.991 --> 41:49.619
You planned this with
your brother, didn't you?

41:50.933 --> 41:52.767
Lieutenant!

41:56.751 --> 41:58.712
He's just a kid.

42:00.241 --> 42:02.751
Heh.

42:04.967 --> 42:05.719
No!

42:10.431 --> 42:11.727
Oh!
