WEBVTT

00:10.893 --> 00:12.734
I discovered a plan to reclaim a prize

00:12.758 --> 00:14.958
so large that it would
upset our world here.

00:15.044 --> 00:17.427
Go get us our prize.

00:17.463 --> 00:19.129
- Are you Underhill?
- I am.

00:19.215 --> 00:21.932
We've no quarrel with you.
We will be taking the girl.

00:21.967 --> 00:24.518
This is Eleanor Guthrie,
the trade boss in Nassau.

00:24.603 --> 00:28.472
Imagine, sir, how London would react
to the arrival of the queen of thieves.

00:28.524 --> 00:30.641
Flint stole from me and
I'm making it right.

00:30.693 --> 00:33.977
You hate Flint. I hate Flint.

00:34.029 --> 00:37.064
Right now,
Flint's plan is the only plan.

00:37.149 --> 00:39.566
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda.

00:39.652 --> 00:42.986
I want to see that noose around your
neck and I want to pull the lever

00:43.038 --> 00:45.572
with my own two ha...

00:45.658 --> 00:49.826
Pirate vessel, what follows
is a message from the lord governor.

00:49.878 --> 00:51.712
I have placed Captain Flint
under arrest.

00:51.797 --> 00:54.498
His trial will be swift and final.

00:54.583 --> 00:58.001
I suggest we get him
the hell out of there.

03:02.001 --> 03:03.418
Abigail.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.233
Abigail, I've made arrangements

03:19.319 --> 03:22.987
for you to be shuttled
to Savannah today.

03:31.364 --> 03:32.830
What?

03:32.866 --> 03:34.532
You'll be taken to Mr. Ashford's house.

03:34.617 --> 03:37.201
I'd like you to stay there
for a few days.

03:37.287 --> 03:40.671
Why would you want me to stay there?

03:42.625 --> 03:46.511
You know what's going
to happen in the square.

03:46.546 --> 03:50.848
Yes, you're going to kill Mr. McGraw.

03:54.053 --> 03:55.970
When these trials take place,

03:56.055 --> 03:58.473
they arouse a great deal of passion.

03:58.558 --> 04:00.475
It is natural.

04:00.560 --> 04:05.029
But it's also something
I'm not comfortable exposing you to.

04:05.064 --> 04:08.065
Is it for my welfare
that you want me to leave

04:08.151 --> 04:09.650
or your own?

04:09.736 --> 04:11.786
What?

04:11.871 --> 04:15.907
You raised me to respect the truth.

04:15.992 --> 04:18.625
To know it is the root of all virtue.

04:21.164 --> 04:23.631
I'm asking if you're sending me away

04:23.716 --> 04:26.501
because you're afraid
someone might ask me

04:26.586 --> 04:29.670
what happened in this house last night
and that I would tell them.

04:29.756 --> 04:32.340
Abigail, I understand that you're upset.

04:32.425 --> 04:34.342
Why aren't you?

04:36.596 --> 04:39.430
A man and a woman rescued me,

04:39.482 --> 04:42.600
cared for me, delivered me home.

04:42.685 --> 04:46.020
Now one of them is dead.
The other is about to be.

04:46.105 --> 04:48.155
And the only man, it seems to me,

04:48.241 --> 04:50.274
to have committed a crime in all this...

04:52.745 --> 04:54.245
still works for you.

04:56.950 --> 04:59.000
Is that not the truth?

05:09.128 --> 05:11.929
What does it matter whether
they hang him or not?

05:11.965 --> 05:14.682
We came here to retrieve this ship.

05:14.767 --> 05:16.017
We've done so.

05:16.102 --> 05:18.769
Ought that not to be the
end of the conversation?

05:18.805 --> 05:20.605
We can say what we will about Flint,

05:20.640 --> 05:23.274
and I've said my share,

05:23.309 --> 05:26.193
but the world knows his name,
they know him.

05:26.279 --> 05:29.647
And his body swinging over
the harbor of this place

05:29.732 --> 05:31.315
sends a powerful message.

05:31.367 --> 05:33.985
No one surrenders to a dying thing.

05:34.070 --> 05:37.038
And that's exactly what
we'll be if we don't act.

05:40.243 --> 05:41.909
Where are the men about it?

05:41.995 --> 05:44.629
Well, those who think
saving Flint's a good idea,

05:44.664 --> 05:46.297
you're taking ashore with you.

05:46.332 --> 05:47.612
Well, it wouldn't make much sense

05:47.634 --> 05:49.333
to take the ones who
think it's a bad idea.

05:49.385 --> 05:52.336
No, you're leaving them with me.

05:52.422 --> 05:55.590
And what exactly do you expect
me to say to them, do you think,

05:55.675 --> 05:58.509
when they ask me why we
don't just turn around,

05:58.561 --> 06:00.344
leave you here

06:00.396 --> 06:03.648
rather than attempt to fight a fight
we are far from certain to win?

06:03.683 --> 06:06.350
Tell them that this endeavor
is in their best interests.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.571
Whether they can see that or not.

06:10.657 --> 06:13.691
And then when they're
through having their laugh,

06:13.776 --> 06:16.527
then what do you expect me to say?

06:18.531 --> 06:21.782
Tell them that if this ship
tries to run on a skeleton crew,

06:21.868 --> 06:24.201
they're going to get chased,
they're going to get caught,

06:24.287 --> 06:25.703
and they're going to get killed.

06:25.788 --> 06:27.455
See if that convinces them.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.270
They're resolved to rescue our captain.

06:43.356 --> 06:45.389
Yet, from the look of things,
they seem as likely

06:45.441 --> 06:47.558
to slaughter us
as the Charles Town militia.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.228
If not more so.

06:51.314 --> 06:53.447
Who said anything about rescuing anyone?

06:55.034 --> 06:56.901
Didn't Captain Vane?

06:59.706 --> 07:02.406
There's a significant difference
between preventing Ashe

07:02.458 --> 07:06.711
from making a trophy of Flint
and saving Flint's life.

07:06.746 --> 07:09.246
Who's to say Vane doesn't
help Flint escape from shore

07:09.298 --> 07:13.084
and then slit his throat the
moment we're in open water?

07:13.136 --> 07:15.252
Along with all of ours?

07:17.090 --> 07:18.589
That was dark.

07:37.076 --> 07:39.610
You and your men are going
to remain under guard

07:39.696 --> 07:41.495
while I go ashore.

07:41.581 --> 07:43.914
You know,
we could help if you let us go.

07:43.950 --> 07:46.784
You can also try and take back
this ship if I let you go.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.421
We share an interest in
seeing Flint rescued,

07:50.456 --> 07:54.375
but make no mistake,
this ship belongs to my men now.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.178
It was bargained to us.
We claimed it and we intend to keep it.

07:57.263 --> 07:59.630
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why are you here?

08:01.267 --> 08:04.435
You could make this
difficult if you wanted.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.220
Riling up your crew,

08:06.305 --> 08:09.473
forcing me to divert
more men to guard you.

08:09.559 --> 08:13.144
But if you meant what you said,

08:13.196 --> 08:15.730
then we all face a war

08:15.815 --> 08:19.483
that we must somehow face together.

08:19.569 --> 08:22.069
And causing trouble wouldn't
make much sense, would it?

08:23.706 --> 08:27.291
You want me to help you keep
my men under guard here?

08:27.326 --> 08:30.828
So that, what,
you can kill us without having to hurry?

08:33.166 --> 08:37.585
In a few hours,
when I leave that square with Flint,

08:37.669 --> 08:41.054
it will be to a different
world than when I entered it.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.006
And in that world,

08:43.058 --> 08:46.010
killing 50 strong men of Nassau

08:46.095 --> 08:48.012
able to stand up and defend her...

08:49.515 --> 08:51.348
what kind of sense does that make?

08:53.019 --> 08:54.401
What about your men?

08:57.023 --> 09:00.274
'Cause I'm not sure they
share that assessment.

09:00.359 --> 09:03.577
Some of them are,
understandably, displeased,

09:03.663 --> 09:06.530
but there aren't enough
of them to sail the ship.

09:06.616 --> 09:09.667
If you can keep your
men from provoking them,

09:09.702 --> 09:13.420
I am confident things
will stand until I return.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.096
Wait.

09:31.941 --> 09:33.557
It isn't gonna work.

09:35.778 --> 09:38.445
Your plan to rescue
Flint isn't gonna work.

09:42.368 --> 09:44.485
But there may be
something I can give you

09:44.570 --> 09:46.487
to make it work.

09:52.795 --> 09:54.578
And of all the villains on the sea

09:54.664 --> 09:56.964
to which we have become
accustomed to fearing,

09:57.049 --> 10:00.217
is there a name spoken more frequently

10:00.253 --> 10:03.087
or with more revulsion than Flint?

10:08.427 --> 10:12.730
Until today
and then potentially never again.

10:12.765 --> 10:13.981
Burn in hell!

10:16.769 --> 10:19.820
Now cast your gaze upon
this once fearsome animal,

10:19.906 --> 10:22.773
brought down by his
own hubris and folly.

10:22.859 --> 10:25.659
The villain Flint who perverts the law,

10:25.745 --> 10:29.864
kidnaps our women,
and slays our blessed sons.

10:29.949 --> 10:33.083
I meant what I said earlier.

10:33.119 --> 10:36.620
This outcome, it's not at all
what I would have wanted.

10:41.627 --> 10:43.961
Vice Admiral Lord Kensington.

10:44.013 --> 10:46.680
I don't need to explain to
you his interest in achieving

10:46.766 --> 10:49.300
the greatest possible
exposure for this proceeding.

10:49.352 --> 10:51.135
String him up!

10:51.187 --> 10:53.520
He's going to put on a show.

10:53.606 --> 10:58.192
And once it begins, I fear I will
not be able to control where it goes.

10:58.277 --> 11:02.229
Unless you give me
what I need to stop it.

11:03.316 --> 11:06.150
Sign a confession

11:06.202 --> 11:10.654
for crimes that you have already
tacitly admitted to me anyway.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.573
I'll see this process stopped.

11:12.658 --> 11:14.658
The sentence will be
carried out quietly,

11:14.744 --> 11:17.411
privately tomorrow.

11:17.496 --> 11:20.247
Spare yourself the humiliation.

11:21.334 --> 11:22.917
Spare her.

11:28.507 --> 11:31.091
I'll see she's interred
with proper respect,

11:31.177 --> 11:34.345
her name clear.

11:34.430 --> 11:36.263
Let her go to her rest peacefully.

11:36.349 --> 11:38.983
You cannot tell me that isn't
what she would have wanted.

11:41.070 --> 11:44.521
She was clear about what she wanted

11:44.573 --> 11:46.490
and I don't think it had anything to do

11:46.525 --> 11:48.525
with begging your forgiveness.

11:49.829 --> 11:53.280
What she wanted was
the truth to be known.

11:54.867 --> 11:57.701
What was the truth of it, my lord?

11:57.787 --> 12:02.339
Why did you betray those closest
to you all those years ago?

12:02.375 --> 12:06.377
Was it really so small
and vile as a bribe?

12:06.429 --> 12:09.713
The promise of lording over
other men in this place?

12:12.685 --> 12:16.720
Or were you simply too weak to say no?

12:16.806 --> 12:19.640
Too cowardly to do the harder thing

12:19.725 --> 12:23.143
and preserve your decency?

12:23.229 --> 12:25.229
Tell me it was the latter.

12:25.281 --> 12:28.532
Tell me this is all happening
because of your cowardice.

12:30.453 --> 12:33.153
I could accept that.

12:33.239 --> 12:35.622
I might forgive that.

12:36.993 --> 12:39.877
We want justice. Hang him now!

12:41.330 --> 12:43.414
And from this day...

12:43.466 --> 12:45.416
I suppose there's my answer.

12:46.469 --> 12:48.385
Even in this moment,

12:48.421 --> 12:51.221
alone with a condemned man,

12:51.257 --> 12:54.258
you are unable to speak the truth.

12:56.095 --> 12:59.146
...one we must put down
to teach a lesson

12:59.231 --> 13:01.648
to all those who brazenly follow

13:01.734 --> 13:04.435
his villainous desires.

13:04.487 --> 13:08.355
And lest you thought you knew
just how evil and devious he was,

13:08.441 --> 13:12.776
you will hear of schemes
almost impossible to believe.

13:12.828 --> 13:16.697
Employing his minions to dastardly ends.

13:16.782 --> 13:19.917
Including a woman he conspired with

13:19.952 --> 13:22.419
to murder our lord governor

13:22.455 --> 13:24.121
in his own home

13:24.206 --> 13:26.957
- and in front of his own daughter's eyes.
- Burn him!

13:27.043 --> 13:30.177
Behold his minion...

13:30.262 --> 13:33.547
who tried and failed
to help Captain Flint

13:33.632 --> 13:36.967
spread his evil deeds
here in Charles Town.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.369
Go on.

13:55.454 --> 13:58.489
I say I have the
situation completely under control.

13:58.574 --> 14:01.075
- I doubt that.
- Enough, we must not act in haste.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.743
And most importantly, we must not panic.

14:02.828 --> 14:04.244
Nothing here is under control, sir.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.080
That much is painfully clear.

14:06.165 --> 14:08.966
How is it you are the only
one of us that cannot see it?

14:11.504 --> 14:13.087
I'm sorry, sir.

14:13.172 --> 14:15.612
Miss Guthrie did not tell me
there was a meeting this morning.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.341
I would have set up...

14:20.396 --> 14:22.179
Where is Miss Guthrie?

14:24.016 --> 14:26.233
She's gone?

14:26.318 --> 14:29.236
Started spreading on
the street a few hours ago.

14:29.321 --> 14:31.188
Word is Hornigold arrested her,

14:31.273 --> 14:33.690
handed her over to the navy.

14:33.776 --> 14:36.360
And what do they think of this news?

14:36.445 --> 14:38.579
Depends which "they"
we're talking about.

14:38.664 --> 14:40.697
The beach is drinking in celebration.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.617
The queen is dead, so on and so forth.

14:43.702 --> 14:45.285
And the merchants?

14:45.371 --> 14:47.287
You know how they get.

14:47.373 --> 14:50.707
A little unrest among the crews and
they sleep with one eye open for a week.

14:50.759 --> 14:54.044
I think this is more than a
little unrest, wouldn't you say?

14:56.932 --> 14:58.682
Yes, I'd say so.

15:02.938 --> 15:04.771
Are you all right?

15:04.857 --> 15:07.474
I'm wondering if they
will try her for piracy.

15:09.311 --> 15:12.446
Do you think they would
do that to a woman?

15:12.531 --> 15:14.231
Hang her in front of a mob

15:14.283 --> 15:16.483
the same as they do to a man?

15:18.904 --> 15:21.572
I know this must be difficult for you.

15:23.409 --> 15:25.325
Less than you think.

15:28.964 --> 15:31.248
How much coin do we have on reserve?

15:31.333 --> 15:33.750
Reserve?

15:33.802 --> 15:36.587
How much money can I have
on hand if I needed it?

15:36.672 --> 15:39.056
The kitchen's funds, today's receipts,

15:39.091 --> 15:41.425
the girls' stashes that we know about?

15:41.510 --> 15:43.093
How would I know that?

15:43.145 --> 15:45.145
Find out for me, please.

15:45.231 --> 15:47.764
And have it made ready
for me immediately.

15:47.850 --> 15:49.933
To buy what?

15:57.576 --> 16:00.661
This journey
will be a strange one, gents.

16:00.746 --> 16:03.780
Unlike any we've taken before.

16:03.866 --> 16:07.618
Because of that,
I have been coy with certain details.

16:07.703 --> 16:11.505
Namely what it is
exactly we'll be hunting.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.123
That ends now.

16:16.045 --> 16:17.844
Brace yourselves, gents,

16:17.930 --> 16:20.297
and let me tell you a story

16:20.382 --> 16:23.050
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

16:23.135 --> 16:25.135
Intelligence man...

16:34.530 --> 16:35.979
But...

16:36.065 --> 16:38.982
What?

16:39.034 --> 16:43.320
Last night you said you'd
thought about not returning...

16:44.823 --> 16:46.573
but...

16:50.963 --> 16:54.214
Standing there on the
jetty in Port Royal...

16:56.335 --> 16:58.335
I realized that was the
first time you and I

16:58.387 --> 17:01.638
had been separated by that much
water since we was fucking kids.

17:01.674 --> 17:03.674
Huh.

17:03.759 --> 17:06.593
Being that far away,
you see things differently.

17:08.896 --> 17:10.981
Helped me see what we are.

17:13.484 --> 17:15.319
Maybe what we ain't.

17:19.825 --> 17:22.576
You saved me from something awful, Jack.

17:22.661 --> 17:25.194
And I owe you my life for it.

17:26.749 --> 17:29.449
Maybe there's some part of
that you just can't owe.

17:34.206 --> 17:36.340
But you can owe it to Max?

17:39.261 --> 17:41.461
I don't feel that way with her.

17:45.351 --> 17:47.934
I was at every tavern in that town

17:48.020 --> 17:50.053
trying to find us spies,

17:50.139 --> 17:52.723
build out this thing we started.

17:54.276 --> 17:57.361
And every time I said my name,

17:57.396 --> 17:59.146
they knew my name.

18:00.316 --> 18:02.866
The first thing they said every time

18:02.901 --> 18:06.069
was your name.

18:06.121 --> 18:08.622
Like we was two halves
of the same thing.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.710
I can't be your wife, Jack.

18:22.755 --> 18:26.139
But you and I are gonna be partners
till they put us in the fucking ground.

18:28.727 --> 18:30.811
As long as you feel the same.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.280
If we run and they chase us,

18:50.332 --> 18:51.615
what are our prospects?

18:51.667 --> 18:55.001
Against two of them and shorthanded?

18:55.087 --> 18:57.788
I'd call our chances roughly even.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.790
Against three trained hunters,

18:59.842 --> 19:03.460
if they have any idea
what they're doing,

19:03.512 --> 19:05.846
I'd say we're about a
dozen skilled men short

19:05.931 --> 19:08.799
of having any fucking
prayer of surviving that.

19:08.884 --> 19:11.551
The captain says we wait, trust him.

19:11.637 --> 19:13.553
Says this is all in our interests.

19:13.639 --> 19:17.224
But the only thing he gives
a shit about is his own ends.

19:17.309 --> 19:21.027
And there's not a goddamn
thing we can do about it.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.660
Hey. Hey.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.217
I think I can help you
get out of this place.

19:49.391 --> 19:51.341
You've got about eight votes.

19:53.178 --> 19:54.895
What?

19:54.980 --> 19:58.682
Eight votes for quartermaster.

20:00.569 --> 20:02.486
What the hell are you talking about?

20:02.521 --> 20:04.938
If you hadn't have cut that forestay,

20:05.023 --> 20:08.575
there's an argument to be made that Vane
would have set sail right away

20:08.660 --> 20:10.777
and probably killed us all.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.697
They know it

20:13.749 --> 20:16.032
and it's having an effect.

20:17.836 --> 20:21.254
I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.

20:21.340 --> 20:23.590
They all seem quite
content with Mr. Scott.

20:26.211 --> 20:29.379
Two kinds of quartermasters
on a crew like this.

20:29.465 --> 20:32.549
The one you feel you're
supposed to vote for,

20:32.601 --> 20:34.885
and the one you want to vote for.

20:34.970 --> 20:37.471
And the former always
gives way to the latter.

20:37.556 --> 20:40.390
And you're comfortable with this?

20:40.442 --> 20:42.859
Not remotely.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.584
This one. Get him up.

21:08.874 --> 21:11.115
What the fuck is this about?
What are you doing with him?

21:11.139 --> 21:12.472
Shut up.

21:28.323 --> 21:31.775
Hey, that's our brother you got there.

21:31.860 --> 21:34.160
Put him down.

21:53.215 --> 21:55.549
Move, you fuckin' die!

22:02.524 --> 22:05.942
Affidavits given by sailors
on ships you attacked.

22:05.978 --> 22:10.397
Testimonials of widows and orphans

22:10.482 --> 22:13.984
rendered into that
state by your actions.

22:14.069 --> 22:17.487
And these are insurance petitions

22:17.573 --> 22:21.491
for the loss or destruction of property,

22:21.543 --> 22:24.494
again caused by your hand.

22:26.632 --> 22:28.882
You stand before this court

22:28.967 --> 22:31.718
accused of wreaking untold havoc

22:31.803 --> 22:34.137
throughout the New World,

22:34.172 --> 22:38.642
of clawing at the very fabric

22:38.677 --> 22:42.178
of civilization that holds us together

22:42.264 --> 22:45.682
with malice

22:45.767 --> 22:48.268
and without regret.

22:48.353 --> 22:51.021
Do you dispute this?

22:54.109 --> 22:58.745
Do you have any response to
these allegations at all?

23:00.666 --> 23:04.868
This forum is your
opportunity to be heard.

23:06.171 --> 23:08.204
And the world is listening.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.375
Deny.

23:12.427 --> 23:14.044
Repent.

23:15.464 --> 23:19.049
No one else is going to
speak on your behalf.

23:19.101 --> 23:22.719
Will you say nothing
in your own defense?

23:25.941 --> 23:30.026
You see? These crimes are so vile

23:30.062 --> 23:32.145
that even their perpetrator

23:32.230 --> 23:35.565
is struck dumb when
given a chance to speak.

23:35.651 --> 23:37.617
I have one regret.

23:39.871 --> 23:42.072
I regret ever coming to this place

23:42.124 --> 23:46.242
with the assumption that a
reconciliation could be found.

23:46.328 --> 23:50.580
That reason could be
a bridge between us.

23:51.833 --> 23:55.135
Everyone is a monster to someone.

23:55.220 --> 23:59.589
Since you are so
convinced that I am yours,

23:59.675 --> 24:01.758
I will be it.

24:04.262 --> 24:06.179
Sir! Sir!

24:11.319 --> 24:12.986
What's going on?

24:14.823 --> 24:16.120
Who is this man?

24:16.177 --> 24:18.711
He says his name is Charles Vane,
my lord.

24:18.712 --> 24:21.111
Charles Vane?

24:26.118 --> 24:27.751
What, and you captured him?

24:27.786 --> 24:29.619
He turned himself over, my lord.

24:29.671 --> 24:32.422
I came to offer testimony

24:32.457 --> 24:34.591
in defense of Captain Flint.

24:34.626 --> 24:38.428
It is his right, is it not?

24:42.217 --> 24:44.350
He was carrying this.

24:51.693 --> 24:54.811
If you are who you say you are,

24:54.863 --> 24:56.863
why would anybody

24:56.948 --> 24:59.783
consider you a credible
character witness?

24:59.818 --> 25:03.236
It isn't my testimony I came to offer.

25:04.990 --> 25:08.158
It's your daughter's.

25:17.602 --> 25:20.303
"I fear the stories I have heard

25:20.338 --> 25:23.089
may have clouded the truth
more than clarified it.

25:23.175 --> 25:25.141
As so many of the stories

25:25.177 --> 25:27.427
were relayed to me by my father,

25:27.512 --> 25:30.680
I am forced to wonder
if he is simply mistaken

25:30.766 --> 25:34.567
or if his motives are something
more deliberate than that."

25:45.747 --> 25:48.498
There's no way of keeping
that out of the record?

25:48.533 --> 25:50.500
Could you?

25:50.535 --> 25:52.085
Of course you could.

25:52.170 --> 25:54.621
You could just throw it into the fire.

25:54.706 --> 25:56.372
But should you?

25:58.260 --> 26:01.711
It was produced in front of
your entire constituency.

26:01.797 --> 26:05.882
You are the protector
of the law in this place

26:05.934 --> 26:09.135
and you brazenly disregard
that at your own peril.

26:12.774 --> 26:15.892
All it takes is one juror
to be taken in by this,

26:15.944 --> 26:19.646
one juror to be seduced by
the scandal of it all...

26:22.234 --> 26:23.983
and Flint goes free.

26:24.069 --> 26:26.820
Flint isn't going anywhere.

26:26.905 --> 26:30.573
That book might engender a couple
of unpleasant months for you here,

26:30.625 --> 26:32.792
raise a couple of
uncomfortable questions,

26:32.878 --> 26:34.627
but what it will not do

26:34.713 --> 26:37.080
is affect the outcome of Flint's trial.

26:37.132 --> 26:39.332
Not with the jury we have empaneled.

26:41.253 --> 26:45.171
The situation is well in hand,

26:45.257 --> 26:46.890
I assure you.

26:46.925 --> 26:48.508
And once Flint is swinging,

26:48.593 --> 26:50.810
we'll turn our attention
to his associate

26:50.896 --> 26:53.980
and have him installed right beside him.

27:21.009 --> 27:22.208
A moment's peace?

27:22.294 --> 27:24.294
Far from it.

27:26.214 --> 27:30.133
I heard the Guthrie shipping
concern was officially disbanded.

27:30.185 --> 27:34.354
Captains Naft and Lawrence's
crews scattered to the wind.

27:34.439 --> 27:39.025
And Mr. Frasier left to
preside over its remains,

27:39.110 --> 27:41.978
empty warehouses, and this tavern.

27:45.033 --> 27:46.783
Were I in your situation,
I might be willing

27:46.818 --> 27:49.152
to consider selling whatever
interests I had left here

27:49.204 --> 27:52.655
and moving on to a more civilized place.

27:52.741 --> 27:55.124
I've heard I ought to expect this visit.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.210
Heard that the madame from the inn

27:57.295 --> 27:59.629
has been taking advantage
of the panic in the street,

27:59.664 --> 28:02.131
offering the merchants
pennies for their interests.

28:02.167 --> 28:05.251
For a few whose faith in
this place was truly waning,

28:05.337 --> 28:09.005
the chance to leave with anything to
show for their interests was a blessing.

28:09.090 --> 28:13.176
You'll find me less eager
to sell than the others,

28:13.228 --> 28:15.478
for I know that your faith in this place

28:15.513 --> 28:17.347
is derived from the secret knowledge

28:17.432 --> 28:20.316
that it is soon to be
awash with Spanish gold.

28:20.352 --> 28:22.101
Even if the gold does return,

28:22.187 --> 28:25.488
it does not alter the reality
of what this place is becoming.

28:25.523 --> 28:27.523
If anything, it will aggravate it,

28:27.609 --> 28:29.659
especially for you.

28:29.694 --> 28:31.411
Is that so?

28:31.496 --> 28:33.446
The pirates of New Providence Island

28:33.531 --> 28:37.116
are about to become more powerful
than they have ever been before

28:37.202 --> 28:39.752
at a time when they
would be less restrained

28:39.838 --> 28:41.921
than they have ever been before.

28:42.007 --> 28:45.675
And this tavern will
still be the crossroads

28:45.710 --> 28:48.211
where their world connects to ours.

28:48.263 --> 28:50.430
Where their disputes are aired.

28:50.515 --> 28:53.850
Where their business is conducted.

28:53.885 --> 28:57.303
Where their passions are expressed.

28:57.389 --> 29:00.890
Is that truly something you want
the responsibility of managing?

29:00.976 --> 29:03.526
So that's it.

29:03.561 --> 29:06.729
You believe you can leap
into Miss Guthrie's shoes

29:06.815 --> 29:09.399
and lord over what remains
of their family's enterprise.

29:09.484 --> 29:12.986
I have no interest in making
the same mistakes Eleanor did.

29:13.071 --> 29:15.455
No interest in fencing their plunder.

29:15.540 --> 29:18.574
No interest in lording
over them in any way.

29:18.660 --> 29:21.627
For people like us, power in this place

29:21.713 --> 29:25.915
is most effective when
it is least perceived.

29:26.001 --> 29:29.752
That is my offer to purchase your
inherited interest in this tavern.

29:29.838 --> 29:33.473
It is more generous than any of the
others received by your colleagues.

29:33.558 --> 29:36.759
I will expect your
response by nightfall.

29:41.933 --> 29:45.601
Why is this so important to you?

29:45.653 --> 29:48.354
Why offer more for this
place than the others?

30:10.545 --> 30:12.462
Sit.

30:19.804 --> 30:22.972
The conflict ahead
promises much risk for us

30:23.058 --> 30:25.775
and very little reward
to compensate for it.

30:25.810 --> 30:29.312
And so we would like
to leave this place.

30:29.397 --> 30:31.114
Now, your friend over here

30:31.149 --> 30:34.400
says you're just the
man to help us do it.

30:34.486 --> 30:36.903
My problem is a shortage of manpower.

30:36.988 --> 30:40.323
I need more men than I have
to fully crew this ship.

30:40.408 --> 30:43.993
And I can't simply release your
crewmates indiscriminately.

30:44.045 --> 30:46.796
I'd be inviting a counterattack
to reclaim the ship.

30:48.633 --> 30:50.299
So I want names.

30:50.335 --> 30:52.335
Names?

30:52.387 --> 30:56.005
One list, 10 men.

30:56.091 --> 30:59.509
Those most likely to
consent to join my crew,

30:59.594 --> 31:01.894
help me sail this ship away from here.

31:03.898 --> 31:07.066
And the men whose names
aren't on that list?

31:13.775 --> 31:16.859
I told them we ain't got no
real connection to this crew.

31:16.911 --> 31:20.496
You help him, we both get
safe passage back to Nassau.

31:31.509 --> 31:33.626
No.

31:33.711 --> 31:35.711
No?

31:35.763 --> 31:37.213
I won't do it.

31:41.052 --> 31:43.302
No!

31:51.112 --> 31:54.647
Do not doubt my seriousness.

31:54.732 --> 31:58.568
In a short while,
escaping from this place

31:58.653 --> 32:01.954
will be far harder than it is right now.

32:02.040 --> 32:05.324
Right now,
the only thing preventing a clean escape

32:05.410 --> 32:07.210
is the men to make it work.

32:07.245 --> 32:09.295
And you're gonna give me those men.

32:09.380 --> 32:13.249
Now, if you kill me,
what good will that do you?

32:13.301 --> 32:15.635
None whatsoever.

32:17.672 --> 32:18.838
No.

32:27.899 --> 32:30.433
You'll let me know when
I might have those names.

32:30.518 --> 32:32.185
Wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

32:35.273 --> 32:39.609
"I am forced to wonder
if he is simply mistaken

32:39.694 --> 32:41.160
or if his motives

32:41.246 --> 32:44.447
are something more deliberate than that.

32:44.532 --> 32:47.283
I fear the stories I carry with me

32:47.335 --> 32:49.619
are my sole comfort.

32:49.671 --> 32:52.588
From across an ocean, it is hard to know

32:52.624 --> 32:54.590
what the New World is.

32:54.626 --> 32:58.211
All I knew were the stories I was told

32:58.296 --> 33:00.129
of monsters and valiant men..."

33:00.181 --> 33:03.049
What the fuck are you doing here?

33:03.134 --> 33:05.635
Came to take your ship.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.971
Stayed to get you out of all this.

33:09.023 --> 33:11.807
Figured if anyone was going
to make a trophy of you,

33:11.859 --> 33:13.859
it really ought to be me.

33:13.945 --> 33:16.195
So this is your plan?

33:16.281 --> 33:18.614
Walk in here and read a girl's diary?

33:18.650 --> 33:20.816
More or less.

33:21.953 --> 33:23.369
I see.

33:25.490 --> 33:28.407
So now you have everyone's
eyes where you want them,

33:28.493 --> 33:32.411
on the two of us, what happens next?

33:58.189 --> 34:01.824
"So much lies ahead
in Charles Town, a future..."

34:01.859 --> 34:03.859
When it happens,

34:03.945 --> 34:06.862
once I'm free, whenever it is,

34:06.914 --> 34:08.864
you won't want to get in my way.

34:08.916 --> 34:12.534
When it happens,
we will be moving to the jetty

34:12.587 --> 34:14.503
and out of this place.

34:14.539 --> 34:18.007
Didn't come all this way to have
them kill you steps from the gallows.

34:21.846 --> 34:24.714
They're all trying so
hard to convince themselves

34:24.766 --> 34:27.766
that they have nothing to be afraid of.

34:27.851 --> 34:29.719
How is running gonna change that?

34:31.022 --> 34:32.221
What do you suggest?

34:32.306 --> 34:35.358
That we remind them

34:35.393 --> 34:37.860
that they were right to be afraid.

34:39.864 --> 34:42.898
"I have to tell you what I know.

34:42.984 --> 34:46.235
The ship was set upon by Captain Flint."

34:46.286 --> 34:47.402
What are you doing?

34:47.487 --> 34:51.956
I wish to speak on
behalf of the defendant.

34:52.043 --> 34:54.083
You have not been recognized.
Sit back and you'll...

34:54.128 --> 34:56.661
These men convinced you
that they speak for you.

34:56.748 --> 34:58.881
- How dare you?
- That the power you've given them

34:58.916 --> 35:00.633
is used in your interests.

35:00.718 --> 35:03.502
I will not have the order in my
court usurped by your foul desires.

35:03.588 --> 35:07.006
That the prisoner before you is
your enemy and they your friends.

35:07.091 --> 35:09.558
For those of you who
live to see tomorrow...

35:12.647 --> 35:16.432
know that you had a
choice to see the truth

35:16.517 --> 35:19.485
and you let yourselves
be convinced otherwise.

35:19.570 --> 35:20.853
That's enough!

35:20.938 --> 35:22.988
Bailiffs, remove him.

35:24.609 --> 35:27.276
I said remove him from the dais.

35:47.849 --> 35:51.100
- Stay down!
- Fire!

36:18.246 --> 36:21.330
Wait! James!

36:34.178 --> 36:37.763
Her word will be the
last word for this place.

36:43.187 --> 36:44.737
Move!

36:59.086 --> 37:01.537
Give me the names!

37:03.040 --> 37:04.373
What?!

37:04.459 --> 37:06.675
They've engaged the blockade.

37:06.711 --> 37:09.378
The patrol ships are scrambling.

37:09.464 --> 37:11.263
Weigh the anchor.

37:11.349 --> 37:13.682
I'll take my chances sailing
over taking on those ships.

37:20.892 --> 37:23.275
What?!

37:23.361 --> 37:25.811
I gave you an order.
What is your fucking problem?

37:25.897 --> 37:27.980
The question you should be asking is

37:28.065 --> 37:29.782
where are his keys...

37:32.703 --> 37:35.955
and has he seen them since
he took me away from my men?

38:01.148 --> 38:03.482
- Get down.
- Stay where you are.

38:03.568 --> 38:05.317
Get canvas out quickly.

38:06.487 --> 38:07.570
Set the full sail.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.440
Take him to Howell.

38:13.945 --> 38:15.277
Help me.

38:17.448 --> 38:20.416
If those ships flank us,
they'll have us.

38:20.451 --> 38:22.868
Then let's make sure they
don't get that chance.

38:22.954 --> 38:24.703
Gun crews at the ready.

38:24.789 --> 38:26.705
Gun crews at the ready!

38:29.093 --> 38:30.459
Fire at will.

38:38.686 --> 38:41.136
Incoming!

38:43.858 --> 38:44.858
Ah!

39:07.715 --> 39:09.832
There they are!

39:09.917 --> 39:11.884
They're over there!

39:11.969 --> 39:13.886
Ah!

39:29.103 --> 39:31.854
- The buildings on the right!
- Every building!

39:33.441 --> 39:35.074
Look down there.

39:36.694 --> 39:38.160
Quickly.

39:57.715 --> 40:00.215
- Open the door!
- Set us free!

40:01.352 --> 40:02.718
Let's go!

40:02.770 --> 40:05.220
There they are!

40:07.274 --> 40:09.141
- Move!
- Ah!

40:32.883 --> 40:34.633
Come on!

40:35.836 --> 40:38.754
Target that launch. Go! Go!

40:43.010 --> 40:44.843
Hurry, lads. Hurry.

40:48.265 --> 40:50.265
- Fire!
- Get them both!

40:53.020 --> 40:54.436
Men!

40:54.522 --> 40:56.772
- Take aim.
- Behind them.

41:25.136 --> 41:26.969
Bring him. Bring him, quickly.

41:29.473 --> 41:31.473
Gently. Gently. Easy.

41:31.559 --> 41:32.880
It'll be all right.

41:35.312 --> 41:37.863
That's it. Someone give him some rum.

41:44.038 --> 41:45.621
Come on.

41:54.582 --> 41:56.331
Oh, come on.

41:56.383 --> 41:58.717
I'm sure we've all seen worse.

42:01.889 --> 42:04.056
I'll do what I can.

42:06.427 --> 42:07.877
What does that mean?

42:08.512 --> 42:10.345
What does that mean?

42:12.850 --> 42:13.850
God.

42:21.742 --> 42:23.692
A bit of turmoil since you left.

42:23.744 --> 42:26.328
But it's under control now.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.416
Release those men.

42:31.502 --> 42:32.951
What?

42:34.088 --> 42:35.120
Captain.

42:35.206 --> 42:37.589
I know what happened and I don't care.

42:37.675 --> 42:39.758
I'll not hold pirates
prisoner on this ship,

42:39.844 --> 42:41.126
not after today.

42:44.265 --> 42:45.881
Keep your men in line.

42:47.268 --> 42:48.884
Take us back towards the sandbar.

42:48.969 --> 42:50.352
Southwest corner of the bay.

42:50.387 --> 42:52.721
We'll start from there.

42:52.773 --> 42:55.224
Ready the guns! Full complement.

42:57.061 --> 42:59.561
What's the target, Captain?

42:59.613 --> 43:01.897
Whatever's left.

43:03.951 --> 43:05.784
Heave!

43:13.494 --> 43:15.244
Would you like me to clear the room?

43:15.296 --> 43:17.830
Why would I want you to clear the room?

43:21.385 --> 43:24.586
When the shock sets in,
you may lose faculties.

43:24.638 --> 43:26.255
Some men lose their bowels.

43:26.307 --> 43:28.173
I can do it with as few
as three or four men.

43:28.259 --> 43:30.342
We're not going anywhere.

43:33.764 --> 43:35.480
I don't want this.

43:35.566 --> 43:37.599
If it doesn't come off quickly,
you won't make it three days.

43:37.651 --> 43:40.402
Did you not fucking hear me?!
I said I do not want this!

43:40.437 --> 43:43.071
You'll die.

43:43.107 --> 43:45.240
This way, there's a very good chance
to prevent it.

43:45.276 --> 43:48.410
The crew will look after you.
Don't worry about that.

43:52.499 --> 43:54.449
Hold him down.

43:54.501 --> 43:56.001
It'll be all right, mate. Come on.

43:56.086 --> 43:57.536
Cannonballs!

43:58.789 --> 44:01.123
- Three, six!
- Heave!

44:01.208 --> 44:03.792
- No! No!
- Steady.

44:05.429 --> 44:06.962
No!

44:07.014 --> 44:08.797
Why don't you move it?!

44:15.022 --> 44:17.472
- Ready?
- No! No!

46:42.503 --> 46:45.754
Where are we?

46:45.840 --> 46:48.891
Just south of Inagua.

46:48.926 --> 46:51.727
Winds blew us east.

46:51.762 --> 46:54.763
We stopped off in Tortuga to refit

46:54.815 --> 46:58.100
and garner news,
of which there was plenty.

47:02.239 --> 47:04.106
Eleanor Guthrie's been arrested.

47:06.277 --> 47:08.694
Currently on her way back to London

47:08.779 --> 47:11.997
in the custody of Her
Majesty's Navy to stand trial.

47:14.618 --> 47:16.668
For the first time since I've known it,

47:16.754 --> 47:19.204
there is no Guthrie in Nassau.

47:20.841 --> 47:25.010
One gets used to a state of
affairs for such a long time,

47:25.095 --> 47:27.846
it's easy to forget that
they're all just transitions.

47:29.383 --> 47:31.466
Specks of dust suspended in the air

47:31.518 --> 47:34.770
until a strong enough gust comes
along and rearranges everything.

47:36.557 --> 47:38.807
A strong gust has come to this place.

47:38.893 --> 47:40.976
The men can feel it.

47:41.061 --> 47:43.478
Know it will upset everything
they thought they understood

47:43.530 --> 47:45.480
just a few days ago.

47:45.566 --> 47:48.150
They'll need to lean on something solid.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.987
On the men who can reassure them

47:52.072 --> 47:53.989
that in times like these,

47:54.041 --> 47:56.325
there are some things
that can be counted on.

47:56.410 --> 47:59.211
They'll look to me for that.

48:00.915 --> 48:04.383
But they'll also look to
their new quartermaster.

48:07.721 --> 48:09.838
They voted?

48:09.924 --> 48:11.673
A few days ago.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.177
I...

48:15.229 --> 48:17.429
I think the men wanted to
tell you when you awoke,

48:17.514 --> 48:20.182
so try and act surprised.

48:23.938 --> 48:25.520
It's a funny thing.

48:25.606 --> 48:29.942
The more those men need you,
the more you need them.

48:30.027 --> 48:33.161
And it drives us to do the
most unexpected things.

48:42.006 --> 48:45.340
There's something you ought to
know before we reach Nassau.

48:48.879 --> 48:51.296
About what we'll likely face there.

48:54.468 --> 48:57.102
Before my misfortune

48:57.187 --> 48:59.771
at the hands of Vane's lieutenant,

48:59.857 --> 49:03.191
our friend, the scout you sent
to oversee the Urca beach,

49:03.227 --> 49:04.776
confessed something to me.

49:04.862 --> 49:07.729
He told me that the news he brought us

49:07.781 --> 49:10.232
about the gold having been recovered...

49:11.318 --> 49:12.734
was a lie.

49:14.154 --> 49:17.205
A falsehood he perpetuated himself

49:17.241 --> 49:20.158
so that he could sell the
gold's location to another crew

49:20.244 --> 49:23.078
in exchange for a larger
share of the prize.

49:25.582 --> 49:27.966
He told you this?

49:36.260 --> 49:38.844
I'm sorry, I'm...

49:38.929 --> 49:41.013
I'm having a hard time...

49:46.236 --> 49:48.487
He lied to us all?

49:49.990 --> 49:53.275
And then he sold the
information to another crew

49:53.360 --> 49:55.944
so that they could retrieve the gold?

49:57.281 --> 49:58.914
Yes.

50:01.251 --> 50:03.668
Who the fuck did he sell it to?

50:33.283 --> 50:35.784
Where have you been?
What took you so long?

50:38.405 --> 50:41.790
The information we were given was...

50:41.825 --> 50:44.042
incomplete at best.

50:44.128 --> 50:47.162
There were still healthy
Spanish soldiers on that beach

50:47.214 --> 50:48.747
and they fought...

50:48.832 --> 50:50.082
like hell.

50:55.839 --> 50:57.589
Is that the Walrus?

50:57.674 --> 50:59.758
It is. We found her there.

50:59.843 --> 51:02.511
Needed to get her seaworthy
before we could depart.

51:02.596 --> 51:05.680
You needed to?
Why would you need a second ship?

51:05.732 --> 51:08.483
We needed the hold space.

51:10.854 --> 51:13.522
Would you like to see something shiny?
