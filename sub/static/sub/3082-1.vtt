00:23.540 --> 00:26.840
<i>Now every time</i>

00:26.940 --> 00:30.880
<i>You hit one more bump in the road</i>

00:30.980 --> 00:34.400
<i>Feel the burden</i>

00:34.500 --> 00:38.320
<i>Of another heavy load</i>

00:38.420 --> 00:41.760
<i>Hit by the curves</i>

00:41.860 --> 00:45.521
<i>Life's unexpected twists and turns</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.840
<i>You feel your world is upside down</i>

00:49.940 --> 00:52.771
<i>And you're tumblin', tumblin, tumblin'</i>

00:55.660 --> 01:00.000
<i>So take a hold from deep within</i>

01:00.100 --> 01:03.880
<i>And find your life once again</i>

01:03.980 --> 01:07.120
<i>You better go down easy</i>

01:07.220 --> 01:11.000
<i>You got a lot to learn</i>

01:11.100 --> 01:14.520
<i>You better count your blessings</i>

01:14.620 --> 01:18.920
<i>Or you're gonna crash and burn</i>

01:21.780 --> 01:26.040
It was another world, Alabama in 1935.

01:26.140 --> 01:28.960
A harder world for sure.

01:29.060 --> 01:30.760
Middle of the Depression.

01:30.860 --> 01:33.640
Not a job to be found for 100 miles

01:33.740 --> 01:36.520
once the cotton was in.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.840
William and Helen Hemsley would
have been better advised

01:39.940 --> 01:43.080
to wait before marrying
and starting a family.

01:43.180 --> 01:46.240
But as they usually do, love and passion

01:46.340 --> 01:49.040
got in front of logic and patience.

01:49.140 --> 01:51.360
And in obedience with the scripture,

01:51.460 --> 01:53.360
the Hemsleys set about the business

01:53.460 --> 01:55.320
of being fruitful and multiplying

01:55.420 --> 01:59.280
and starting a whole new life
in the big city of Decatur.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.800
Sir.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.280
Say, I was wondering

02:19.380 --> 02:20.280
if maybe you got any more work

02:20.380 --> 02:21.520
a fellow could do around here...

02:21.620 --> 02:23.600
No, we're done till seeding.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.520
Sir, please.

02:25.620 --> 02:26.880
We got a baby coming due
and there ain't no...

02:26.980 --> 02:29.880
Son, I don't have anything.

02:29.980 --> 02:32.162
There's nothing I can do for you.

02:45.860 --> 02:50.284
William, honey. Meet your sons.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.164
They're perfect, just like you.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.880
Mr. William,

03:05.980 --> 03:09.050
y'all got two fine looking boys here.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.840
Tent revivals were a common occurrence

03:17.940 --> 03:20.080
in the rural South in the Depression.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.880
People needing healing, prayer,

03:22.980 --> 03:25.920
and just some hope in a
poor and frightening time.

03:26.020 --> 03:29.320
For William Hemsley,
all of these applied.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.720
What should've been the
happiest day of his life

03:31.820 --> 03:34.760
was quickly becoming
the most troublesome.

03:34.860 --> 03:39.320
<i>...we first begun</i>

03:39.420 --> 03:42.280
Reverend Reece Wade was
a traveling evangelist

03:42.380 --> 03:43.960
out of middle Tennessee.

03:44.060 --> 03:47.360
And his message this cold October night

03:47.460 --> 03:51.000
would reach right into
William's troubled soul.

03:51.100 --> 03:55.762
And it is here that our
story truly begins.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.080
Blacks and whites, Jews and Gentiles,

04:00.180 --> 04:02.960
all equal in the eyes of the Lord.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.000
All equal in the eyes of the Lord!

04:06.100 --> 04:07.200
Amen.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.400
And let us never forget.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.160
Let us never forget the words

04:10.260 --> 04:13.000
of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ,

04:13.100 --> 04:17.560
who says it is truly more blessed
to give than to receive.

04:17.660 --> 04:19.120
Amen.

04:19.220 --> 04:23.211
It is truly more blessed
to give than to receive.

04:32.580 --> 04:36.605
That's my precious wife Louise,
sitting right over here.

04:42.780 --> 04:47.647
We miscarried again over Thanksgiving.

04:49.100 --> 04:52.160
The doctor over in Birmingham

04:52.260 --> 04:56.000
told us to stop trying,

04:56.100 --> 04:57.920
or it might be her that goes.

04:58.020 --> 05:02.880
And all the gifts He's given us,

05:02.980 --> 05:05.287
that's the one we wanted most.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.247
All of our dreams were of having a baby.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.728
Family of our own...

05:17.500 --> 05:19.489
love...

05:21.940 --> 05:24.361
to take care of.

05:28.340 --> 05:33.401
Maybe... maybe y'all could
pray for us tonight.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.568
For our own miracle.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.720
What?

06:01.820 --> 06:02.840
Now, I know this sounds...

06:02.940 --> 06:06.120
Crazy? Absolutely insane?

06:06.220 --> 06:08.200
- Just listen to me.
- No, William.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.040
Just listen!
We can't do it.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.280
We can't even feed ourselves.
Now we got two more?

06:13.380 --> 06:15.240
I'm not giving away my babies!

06:15.340 --> 06:17.720
I'll work two jobs.
I'll work three!

06:17.820 --> 06:20.080
Having a job is my job!
And there ain't none!

06:20.180 --> 06:22.567
There ain't no work anywhere.

06:24.940 --> 06:27.200
We're drowning.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.051
We got nothing and no way to get along.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.840
They'll take them away from
us if we can't feed them.

06:35.940 --> 06:39.160
What if they get sick or
something happens to me?

06:39.260 --> 06:41.840
You're going to raise two
babies mending dresses?

06:41.940 --> 06:44.168
So you just give them both up?

06:48.540 --> 06:50.600
One.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.560
Now, we can make it with just one.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.520
No, William Hemsley.

06:54.620 --> 06:57.371
Nobody is taking my babies from me.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.687
Never.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.525
They're here.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.042
All right.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.600
Well, I'm sure you're all wondering

07:34.700 --> 07:37.087
why I asked you out
here so urgent and all.

07:39.620 --> 07:43.042
I heard you at the revival,
reverend, and...

07:46.500 --> 07:48.000
it made me think.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.400
And I was talking it
over here with my wife

07:51.500 --> 07:54.400
and we want to ask you something.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.960
Let me see if I can make
this a little easier.

07:57.060 --> 08:00.360
The Bible says we're all
brothers and sisters in Christ.

08:00.460 --> 08:04.520
Our job is to love and
look out for one another.

08:04.620 --> 08:07.520
Now Louise and I prayed
and talked over this

08:07.620 --> 08:10.080
and we want you to have a
love offering given to us.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.680
Oh no.
Thank you but...

08:11.780 --> 08:14.320
- Please take it.
- Take it.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.680
No, thank you, but that's not
why we wanted to see you.

08:17.780 --> 08:20.600
You see, Helen and I have
been praying ourselves

08:20.700 --> 08:25.240
and we think God's give
us both some answers.

08:25.340 --> 08:26.920
Now, we can give everything we got

08:27.020 --> 08:29.200
to raise one child and that is it.

08:29.300 --> 08:34.039
Maybe someone else,
like a man and woman of God,

08:34.140 --> 08:36.320
could give the other
a life we never could.

08:36.419 --> 08:38.488
No, no.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.800
You're beautiful and blessed people

08:44.900 --> 08:47.080
to even consider such a thing.

08:47.180 --> 08:51.640
But you're just tired, honey,
and scared and emotional.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.720
Times is hard for everybody.

08:53.820 --> 08:55.920
No, we prayed on it like you say to do.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.560
No, William. We can't.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.360
You preached it, reverend.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.000
It's better to give than receive.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.440
You don't know this ain't
God answering your prayers.

09:08.540 --> 09:13.400
Maybe He's got something special
in mind for one of our boys.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.600
You see...

09:15.700 --> 09:19.160
it's God we're really giving him to.

09:19.260 --> 09:21.320
That's what the Lord wants.

09:21.420 --> 09:24.091
We both know it.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.687
And you both know it too.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.606
The Lord will choose for you.

10:12.180 --> 10:14.680
I'll love him good for both of us.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.405
Thank you.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.164
And God be with you, sister.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.520
Dexter Ryan is not to know
until Helen and I pass.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.529
Give me your word on that, pastor?

10:32.660 --> 10:34.728
Yeah, you have my word.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.200
I don't know what to say.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.320
There's nothing to say.

10:48.420 --> 10:50.204
He's God's now anyway.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.048
Now, go.

11:18.180 --> 11:22.160
It was not uncommon in
the 1930s to lose a baby.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.640
There was a funeral for the child

11:23.740 --> 11:26.320
they gave away the next day.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.520
All William and Helen could afford

11:28.620 --> 11:31.040
was a shoe box to bury him in.

11:31.140 --> 11:34.608
Of course, only they
knew the box was empty.

11:58.620 --> 12:02.520
And somewhere, on the road
to their new life as a family,

12:02.620 --> 12:05.720
the Reverend Reece Wade
stole away with his new son

12:05.820 --> 12:09.240
and dedicated him to
the creator of life itself,

12:09.340 --> 12:11.761
the king of the universe.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.800
Amen.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.049
Ryan Reece Wade,
welcome to your new life.

12:23.700 --> 12:28.000
<i>Christ the Lord is ris'n today</i>

12:28.100 --> 12:33.480
<i>Alleluia!</i>

12:33.580 --> 12:38.440
<i>Raise your joys and triumphs high</i>

12:38.540 --> 12:42.680
<i>Alleluia!</i>

12:42.780 --> 12:45.000
You'd almost say little Ryan Wade was

12:45.100 --> 12:49.200
like any boy in the 1940s,
except for one thing.

12:49.300 --> 12:54.280
When he sang a song,
he could bring the roof down.

12:54.380 --> 13:00.120
Nehemiah, Esther, Psalms...

13:00.220 --> 13:01.440
Job.

13:01.540 --> 13:05.611
Job. Yeah, Job, Psalms...

13:09.740 --> 13:12.920
- Proverbs?
- Proverbs...

13:13.020 --> 13:15.487
How many books of the
Bible are there, Daddy?

13:16.860 --> 13:20.560
You tell me. Sixty...

13:20.660 --> 13:23.000
- 66.
- 66.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.080
How many in the Old Testament?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.600
- 39.
- 39.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.640
You're on number 20 with Proverbs.

13:30.740 --> 13:33.446
Now, come on.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.520
And do not be conformed to this world,

13:39.620 --> 13:42.480
but transformed by the
renewing of your mind.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.040
That you may prove what
is good and acceptable,

13:45.140 --> 13:46.605
the perfect will of God.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.487
Jeremiah 29.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.041
For I know the plans...

14:03.540 --> 14:06.166
I have for you.

14:12.460 --> 14:17.840
- Declares the Lord.
- Declares the Lord.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.720
But when memorizing
proved to be a challenge,

14:20.820 --> 14:22.520
Ryan knew instinctively

14:22.620 --> 14:26.160
what every grade school teacher knows.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.960
Turn it into a song.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.680
<i>Well</i>

14:31.780 --> 14:41.240
<i>I know the plans I have for you</i>

14:41.340 --> 14:44.250
<i>Declares the Lord</i>

14:48.300 --> 14:53.200
<i>Plans to prosper and not to harm you</i>

14:53.300 --> 14:56.120
<i>And then shall call and pray to me</i>

14:56.220 --> 14:58.400
<i>And I will listen to ya</i>

14:58.500 --> 15:02.320
<i>And ye shall seek and ye shall find</i>

15:02.420 --> 15:07.520
<i>When you seek with all of your heart</i>

15:16.060 --> 15:18.560
Louise was smitten with the boy's gift.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.240
Reece accepted it, but, in his view,

15:21.340 --> 15:26.082
Ryan was set aside to follow in
his footsteps as a man of God.

15:28.940 --> 15:31.720
<i>...price to pay</i>

15:31.820 --> 15:34.800
<i>She walks right in, she walks right out</i>

15:34.900 --> 15:38.200
<i>She sing and dance, she jump and shout</i>

15:38.300 --> 15:44.600
<i>Whoa, baby,
don't you just walk by me...</i>

15:44.700 --> 15:47.644
Am I the master of the fake ID or what?

15:53.940 --> 15:56.247
Oh, no thank you.

15:58.660 --> 16:02.320
Come on, man.
You can't be a PK forever.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.760
PK?

16:03.860 --> 16:06.560
PK. Preacher's Kid.
That's you.

16:06.660 --> 16:09.480
"Please Lord,
never let me have any fun."

16:09.580 --> 16:12.920
That's what I am, Dino. Besides...

16:13.020 --> 16:14.160
I don't like beer.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.601
More for me.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.251
I like beer a lot.

16:23.140 --> 16:26.320
Man! Are you listening to this?

16:26.420 --> 16:27.840
Yeah.

16:27.940 --> 16:30.120
Wow.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.527
I ain't never heard
anything like it before.

16:34.180 --> 16:36.320
How come we can't do music
like this back home?

16:36.420 --> 16:39.920
In Tennessee, in your daddy's church?

16:40.020 --> 16:41.440
Cat, you crazy.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.840
I ain't talking about church, Dino.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.930
I'm just talking about music.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.960
<i>She walk right in, she walk right out</i>

16:53.060 --> 16:55.840
A PK is always the wildest at heart.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.760
<i>Baby baby</i>

16:57.860 --> 17:00.486
<i>Don't you just walk by me</i>

17:22.260 --> 17:24.720
it's 1:45 in the morning.

17:24.819 --> 17:27.400
You been drinking, son?

17:27.500 --> 17:28.960
No, sir.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.400
Don't lie to me.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.204
I ain't lying, Daddy.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.840
You smell like smoke.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.120
I wasn't smoking either.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.320
Where you been?

17:40.420 --> 17:42.640
At Dino's place.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.171
Is that so?

17:45.780 --> 17:48.720
I drove by Dino's when I
was out looking for you.

17:48.820 --> 17:51.924
Must've just missed you.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.760
I was at a roadhouse across County Line.

17:56.860 --> 17:57.520
What?

17:57.620 --> 17:58.800
Daddy, it ain't what you think.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.600
A honky-tonk?

18:00.700 --> 18:02.000
Well, I knew if I told you,
you'd never let me go.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.440
You're underage!

18:03.540 --> 18:05.560
And you're going into the ministry.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.640
I went to listen to some music, Daddy.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.360
What did I do that's so wrong?

18:09.460 --> 18:11.722
You didn't tell me the truth,
that's what.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.840
<i>Dance, dance, dance, everybody now</i>

18:16.940 --> 18:19.440
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

18:19.540 --> 18:21.080
<i>Everybody's doing it</i>

18:21.180 --> 18:23.960
<i>It's boogie-woogie rock and roll</i>

18:24.060 --> 18:26.367
<i>Yeah</i>

18:28.420 --> 18:29.960
Yeah, that's a good song, cuz.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.320
Yeah, man.
We need more guys though.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.920
Well, we need more everything.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.480
Man, we get some guys in here.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.560
I'll sing the songs, write the songs.

18:37.660 --> 18:39.880
You play the drums.
It's all I want to do.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.640
Hey, you call the tune, I'll play it.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.411
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it, oh!

18:46.820 --> 18:48.720
Forty years.

18:48.820 --> 18:53.440
Forty years wandering the desert.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.120
Looking for a sign.

18:56.220 --> 19:00.000
Praying for an answer,

19:00.100 --> 19:02.320
a direction.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.568
But sometimes...

19:05.660 --> 19:08.206
God's answer to His children...

19:11.100 --> 19:13.089
is wait.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.120
Hey, what's the rush?

19:21.220 --> 19:22.800
You're sure your daddy's okay with this?

19:22.900 --> 19:24.320
Oh, yeah, man, I take
his car all the time.

19:30.980 --> 19:32.920
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

19:33.020 --> 19:34.360
Oh no, he looks mad!

19:34.460 --> 19:37.440
Get out! Get back here!

19:37.540 --> 19:41.520
Get back here! Get back here!

19:41.620 --> 19:47.960
<i>You gotta get up, come on
You gotta get up, come on</i>

19:48.060 --> 19:50.400
<i>Put on your dancin' feet</i>

19:50.500 --> 19:52.960
<i>You gotta get up, come on</i>

19:53.060 --> 19:56.040
I've never seen anyone move like that.

19:56.140 --> 19:58.160
He just don't care.

19:58.260 --> 20:01.560
Now I grant you, it was a
tad odd on a first date

20:01.660 --> 20:04.200
to visit a honky-tonk across the tracks.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.760
But Ryan was unlike any
boy I had ever met.

20:07.860 --> 20:12.280
Sweet and gentle, a gentleman
through and through.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.600
When that music started,

20:14.700 --> 20:18.043
it was like a fire erupted
in that heart of his.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.926
You're so pretty in your face.

20:33.980 --> 20:37.280
I was wondering if
you'd ever ask me out.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.360
What took you so long, anyway?

20:39.460 --> 20:42.680
I was afraid you'd say no.

20:42.780 --> 20:44.689
Well, I didn't, did I?

20:46.420 --> 20:47.560
No, you didn't.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.320
Hey, girl, you can really do this.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.560
Well, I should say
the same thing of you.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.160
Where did a preacher's kid learn
to dance the way that you do?

21:04.260 --> 21:06.480
Oh, well I don't know.

21:06.580 --> 21:09.524
Something just happens
to me when I hear music.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.120
You know, whatever it is,

21:17.220 --> 21:19.687
it's a good thing, Ryan Wade.

21:22.860 --> 21:26.320
Hey. You better keep them pipes warm.

21:26.420 --> 21:29.364
This party's just getting started.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.800
That was nice.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.800
Maybe we can do this again sometime.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.800
I would like that, Ryan Wade.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.560
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
please have your attention.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.600
For our next number,
we'd like to bring up

21:50.700 --> 21:52.880
a very special guest.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.600
Now it appears we have a
very talented young man

21:55.700 --> 21:57.600
in our midst tonight.

21:57.700 --> 22:01.840
And the rumor is dude
can really bring it on home.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.440
Well, let's just see.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.080
Please welcome the man with
all those dance moves,

22:08.180 --> 22:09.920
Mr. Ryan Wade.

22:10.020 --> 22:13.400
There are many accounts
of how, when, and where

22:13.500 --> 22:15.480
rock n' roll was actually born.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.640
Now I'm not saying they're
wrong or anything,

22:17.740 --> 22:20.080
But I believe part of that birth

22:20.180 --> 22:24.800
happened on this very night in
little old Lebanon, Tennessee.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.520
Is this you?

22:26.620 --> 22:28.520
We've got the tune from
Little Drummer Boy.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.529
You lead, we'll follow.

22:36.060 --> 22:38.920
<i>Give me a song, Mr. Music Man</i>

22:39.020 --> 22:41.120
<i>Want to hear your rockin' band</i>

22:41.220 --> 22:43.680
<i>Play it loud, don't you play it sweet</i>

22:43.780 --> 22:46.080
<i>I got a feelin' in my feet</i>

22:46.180 --> 22:47.960
<i>Boogie-woogie rock 'n roll</i>

22:48.060 --> 22:50.760
<i>Guitar picking with a lot of soul</i>

22:50.860 --> 22:53.000
<i>Everybody's doing it</i>

22:53.100 --> 22:55.280
<i>It's boogie-woogie rock 'n roll</i>

22:55.380 --> 22:57.720
<i>Boogie-woogie rock 'n roll</i>

22:57.820 --> 23:00.760
<i>Guitar picking with a lot of soul</i>

23:00.860 --> 23:02.480
<i>Call it whatever you like</i>

23:02.580 --> 23:04.840
<i>It's boogie-woogie rock 'n roll</i>

23:04.940 --> 23:07.720
<i>Dance, dance, dance, everybody now</i>

23:07.820 --> 23:09.640
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

23:09.740 --> 23:12.360
<i>Dance, dance, dance, everybody now</i>

23:12.460 --> 23:14.200
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

23:14.300 --> 23:16.760
<i>Everybody's doing it</i>

23:16.860 --> 23:18.960
<i>It's boogie-woogie rock 'n roll</i>

23:19.060 --> 23:20.571
<i>Yeah</i>

23:22.900 --> 23:25.240
<i>Boogie-woogie rock n' roll</i>

23:25.340 --> 23:27.480
<i>Guitar pickin' with a lot of soul</i>

23:27.580 --> 23:30.763
Well, well, well, well.
Look at what we have here.

23:35.340 --> 23:37.920
Wesley, I thought you said this was just

23:38.020 --> 23:40.009
a grand theft auto call.

23:41.340 --> 23:45.400
Son, you can either
go to jail or go home.

23:45.500 --> 23:49.127
After talking to your daddy,
I'd choose jail.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.681
Get that, punk.

23:54.940 --> 23:57.320
This place is starting to match my mood.

23:57.420 --> 24:00.240
Dark and stinky.

24:00.340 --> 24:02.000
You smell that, Wesley?

24:02.100 --> 24:06.520
That's hootie weed.
They're reefers.

24:06.620 --> 24:10.280
Serving alcohol to minors...

24:10.380 --> 24:14.120
and a preacher's boy,
bringing the devil music.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.961
Get down off that stage, boy.
Get down off that stage!

24:21.420 --> 24:25.440
Boy, you know we don't go
for that kind of music.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.802
You understand me?

24:28.740 --> 24:30.480
Do you understand me?

24:30.580 --> 24:32.080
There ain't nothing
wrong with this music.

24:32.180 --> 24:35.568
There ain't nothing wrong
with these people.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.600
There seems to be a
little misunderstanding

24:39.700 --> 24:42.480
of the law around here.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.200
Are we clear?

24:44.300 --> 24:46.600
Wesley, shut this place down!

24:46.700 --> 24:48.360
Get out of here!

24:48.460 --> 24:50.369
Now!

24:53.660 --> 24:56.440
I had to give him the taste
of the back of my hand.

24:56.540 --> 24:58.320
- Did you now?
- Yeah, I did.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.440
He didn't like it too much either.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.840
He almost came after me.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.400
- He did what?
- He almost came after me.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.200
Sir, this will be taken
care of, I promise you.

25:07.300 --> 25:07.960
I don't know what he thinks about

25:08.060 --> 25:11.360
bringing minors into a honky-tonk.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.720
Just make sure it don't happen again.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.120
I am truly sorry.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.890
Sorry, buddy.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.520
Get out of the car.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.041
I said get out of the car.

25:28.380 --> 25:30.608
- Thank you, sheriff.
- Y'all take care.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.920
What do you think I should
preach on tomorrow?

25:35.020 --> 25:37.880
Turn the other cheek?
Eye for an eye?

25:37.980 --> 25:40.520
Why don't you preach the sermon for me?

25:40.620 --> 25:41.840
Maybe sing a little song.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.640
I didn't do anything...

25:43.740 --> 25:45.120
You're lucky he didn't
throw you in jail, boy.

25:45.220 --> 25:46.880
I didn't do anything wrong, Daddy.

25:46.980 --> 25:50.720
Come on. You didn't do anything right!

25:50.820 --> 25:53.600
I told you never to step
foot in that place again.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.480
How's that for starters?

25:56.580 --> 25:57.720
And you're dragging two
underage girls with you?

25:57.820 --> 25:59.800
Mouthing off to the sheriff?

25:59.900 --> 26:02.360
He's a redneck. And he's
picking on these people, Daddy.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.160
I do know that!
But that's not your fight.

26:05.260 --> 26:07.283
Not yet.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.640
This little musical tour
of yours, it's over.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.400
It's time for an apology tour,

26:15.500 --> 26:17.880
starting with your mother
who's worried sick.

26:17.980 --> 26:20.360
And tomorrow,
you're apologizing to the church,

26:20.460 --> 26:23.680
most of whom have called
the house already tonight.

26:23.780 --> 26:28.040
And on Monday, you and I
are driving to Nashville

26:28.140 --> 26:30.891
and you're joining the army, boy.

26:37.340 --> 26:40.320
You are my son, Ryan Wade,

26:40.420 --> 26:42.720
and I love you more than
you will ever know.

26:42.820 --> 26:47.881
But it's time for you to
grow up and be a man.

26:54.980 --> 26:58.680
I wasn't sure if I would
ever see Ryan Wade again.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.920
His daddy thought it was time for Ryan

27:01.020 --> 27:02.760
to grow up and be a man.

27:02.860 --> 27:05.040
And Uncle Sam set about the task

27:05.140 --> 27:08.289
of turning Ryan Wade into that man.

27:10.220 --> 27:13.960
<i>She's lookin' so fine
in her high heel shoes</i>

27:14.060 --> 27:17.400
<i>You better look out,
she'll give you the blues</i>

27:17.500 --> 27:20.480
<i>You better think twice
when she walks your way</i>

27:20.580 --> 27:24.162
<i>To be with her there's a price to pay</i>

27:27.940 --> 27:31.360
Attention!

27:31.460 --> 27:33.840
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

27:33.940 --> 27:37.960
I have five vehicles down,
one trailer that needs an axle,

27:38.060 --> 27:39.920
and a jeep that needs an oil change,

27:40.020 --> 27:41.800
and you knuckleheads decide to

27:41.900 --> 27:44.680
do a private concert in my motor pool!

27:44.780 --> 27:46.720
Lock it up.

27:46.820 --> 27:51.160
Private Wade, this is your new job,
serenading my motor pool?

27:51.260 --> 27:52.720
Sir, no, sir.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.040
Well, while we're on the subject,

27:54.140 --> 27:56.800
I got a question for you.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.082
Where'd you learn to
sing like that, boy?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.050
Let's hear another one.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.000
As you were!

28:06.100 --> 28:09.600
Only fate, DNA, or the good Lord Himself

28:09.700 --> 28:13.000
seemed to have other plans
for Private Ryan Wade.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.880
All right boys, let's do it.

28:14.980 --> 28:18.520
Ryan sang his way through
two years in the army,

28:18.620 --> 28:22.840
developing his raw talents into
a world class singing voice,

28:22.940 --> 28:25.720
having not a clue
that over in Nashville,

28:25.820 --> 28:28.520
a young man by the name of Drexel Hemsley

28:28.620 --> 28:31.520
was on a similar,
if less structured, path.

28:35.420 --> 28:41.120
<i>Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go</i>

28:41.220 --> 28:45.120
<i>Beboppin' baby, shake, a rock 'n roll</i>

28:45.220 --> 28:52.160
<i>You can ask her to dance,
but she don't wanna dance slow</i>

28:52.260 --> 28:56.410
<i>Beboppin' baby, girl,
you got me in a spin...</i>

29:00.060 --> 29:01.760
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

29:01.860 --> 29:03.560
This is Dr. Ralph Jennings,

29:03.660 --> 29:05.760
president of the
Southeastern Bible College.

29:05.860 --> 29:09.600
Your father tells me you got a mind
to follow in his footsteps someday.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.400
And if you perceive the
same call that he did,

29:11.500 --> 29:14.160
there's always a spot for you there.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.125
See, what did I tell you, son?

29:24.420 --> 29:28.960
And the Lord told Jonah to go to Nineveh
and warn them of impending judgment.

29:29.060 --> 29:33.360
The problem is, Jonah wasn't listening,

29:33.460 --> 29:35.400
and a certain fish was waiting

29:35.500 --> 29:39.685
when he decided to run away from God.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.040
Honey, what is it?

29:52.140 --> 29:54.004
It's a good thing you're sitting down.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.085
Okay, so?

30:02.980 --> 30:05.160
<i>Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go</i>

30:05.260 --> 30:09.524
Drexel Hemsley.
Drexel Hemsley!

30:10.780 --> 30:12.400
Oh, Ryan cannot hear this.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.080
I don't think that's possible.

30:14.180 --> 30:18.083
- Why?
- It's in every storefront in town.

30:19.540 --> 30:21.165
How it do?

30:29.700 --> 30:35.080
<i>Girl, slow down,
I want to get to know ya</i>

30:35.180 --> 30:37.520
I know that I can show ya

30:37.620 --> 30:40.720
Who is this?

30:40.820 --> 30:44.606
<i>Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go</i>

30:46.300 --> 30:49.760
<i>Beboppin' baby, shake, rock 'n roll</i>

30:49.860 --> 30:54.320
How many times can that
boy play the same song?

30:54.420 --> 30:55.960
Apparently as many times as

30:56.060 --> 30:58.760
Jesus taught Peter we are to forgive.

31:00.060 --> 31:01.520
It's a fad.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.680
These things never last.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.089
Oh my Lord!

31:15.060 --> 31:16.960
What's that?

31:17.060 --> 31:18.640
That there is the carb, Daddy.

31:18.740 --> 31:21.720
A what? A carb?

31:21.820 --> 31:23.920
A valve shot.

31:24.020 --> 31:25.280
On the carb?

31:25.380 --> 31:27.120
Yeah, you need...
you need a new one.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.360
Okay.

31:28.460 --> 31:33.520
It ain't the first time.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.160
What's it do?

31:35.260 --> 31:39.960
Feeds fuel to the engine.

31:40.860 --> 31:43.008
You got some bad jets.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.960
You learned about cars in the army?

31:46.060 --> 31:48.760
No, sir, always messed
with 'em. You know that.

31:48.860 --> 31:51.840
I've never seen you take
one of these thingies out.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.247
That's something new.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.043
How you doing, son?

32:03.740 --> 32:05.800
I'm okay.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.400
Figuring it out, I guess.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.680
I don't think we ever
really do figure it out.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.480
That's God's job.

32:12.580 --> 32:16.560
Our job is to be who He made us to be

32:16.660 --> 32:20.082
and to do what He calls us to do.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.040
That's the preacher talking.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.280
Your dad here,

32:26.380 --> 32:29.040
I'm mighty proud of you, son.

32:29.140 --> 32:30.920
For hearing the calling

32:31.020 --> 32:34.840
and staying obedient to it.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.691
Come on, let's get something to eat.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.920
Hello there!

33:06.020 --> 33:09.442
Hello. Can you hold on a sec?
I just got this bolt.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.960
Oh, boy.

33:17.060 --> 33:21.240
Does that boy have 24
carat pipes or what!

33:21.340 --> 33:23.568
Oh, man!

33:25.580 --> 33:26.680
You're a fan, I see.

33:26.780 --> 33:28.245
Oh yeah.

33:30.860 --> 33:32.520
Are you guys related or something?

33:32.620 --> 33:34.040
You're a dead ringer for him.

33:34.140 --> 33:36.840
I know. I hear it all the time but no.

33:36.940 --> 33:39.000
Not related, nothing.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.680
Avi Hirshberg of the
Brooklyn Hirshbergs.

33:41.780 --> 33:43.560
Don't let the cowboy accent fool you.

33:43.660 --> 33:45.520
It's just good for business.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.120
Gotcha. Ryan Wade.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.920
Well, how do you do, Mr. Wade.

33:49.020 --> 33:50.160
How can I help you?

33:50.260 --> 33:52.200
Valve shot on this carb.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.720
Yeah.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.640
I think it's past rebuilding.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.480
Oh no, I'm gonna have to
order a new one, I think.

33:57.580 --> 34:00.480
Where... where'd you pull this out of?

34:00.580 --> 34:02.280
Flat Head Six.

34:02.380 --> 34:04.240
All right. Sounds like you
know your way around cars.

34:04.340 --> 34:08.440
I know enough to know when I
need to go to a real mechanic.

34:08.540 --> 34:11.530
Want a job?

34:12.739 --> 34:14.560
- No, thanks.
- No, really.

34:14.659 --> 34:16.639
I got one.
I go to school too.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.360
Oh come on, work with me.

34:18.460 --> 34:20.679
We'll be hanging around
fixing carburetors,

34:20.780 --> 34:22.520
singing along with Drexel.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.159
I even do barbecue Fridays.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.320
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you $10 a week

34:26.420 --> 34:28.000
and all you can eat.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.560
That sounds tempting but no, thanks.

34:31.659 --> 34:33.320
All right, it's too bad.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.920
All right, tell you what,
you come around Wednesday,

34:37.020 --> 34:38.080
I should have it done.

34:38.179 --> 34:39.320
Wednesday?

34:39.420 --> 34:40.600
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.643
I'll see you then.
Thank you.

34:44.219 --> 34:46.004
I can't get over how
much you look like him.

34:48.060 --> 34:49.719
Good morning, Mrs. Carter.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.120
Good morning.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.163
There you go.
Sign here for me.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.411
Ladies.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.123
Thank you.

35:17.100 --> 35:25.520
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

35:25.620 --> 35:30.931
<i>Even when we're far away</i>

35:32.900 --> 35:41.360
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

35:41.460 --> 35:47.841
<i>Until the morning brings another day</i>

35:52.220 --> 35:54.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:54.100 --> 35:57.160
I just want everyone to know
this is a fine young man,

35:57.260 --> 36:00.640
and that song he just sang,
that's his mother's favorite.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.080
Yes sir, it is.

36:02.180 --> 36:03.280
How about that everybody?

36:03.380 --> 36:05.240
That was nice.

36:05.340 --> 36:07.880
That's our show.
We'll see you next week.

36:07.980 --> 36:10.481
You know, I can see right inside of him.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.320
I know what he's thinking.

36:15.420 --> 36:18.320
I know what he's going to say.

36:18.420 --> 36:21.285
I even know what his next
dance move is going to be.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.400
I may just be crazy.

36:26.500 --> 36:30.200
Mama, I can't do this anymore.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.920
Do what?

36:32.020 --> 36:35.600
I don't hear this call
Daddy wants me to hear.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.520
It ain't there.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.920
Took you long enough to figure that out.

36:40.020 --> 36:42.120
So, Mama, what's the point
of me going to school

36:42.220 --> 36:44.846
for a call I don't hear?

36:47.180 --> 36:48.800
I still go out to Nashville,

36:48.900 --> 36:51.128
places y'all wouldn't approve of.

36:54.380 --> 36:57.760
Just to hear real music getting played.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.920
I hurt so bad Mama because...

37:01.020 --> 37:03.248
it's the only call I hear.

37:05.980 --> 37:08.128
When do you plan to tell your daddy?

37:13.180 --> 37:15.320
Maybe you can tell him for me.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.440
No.

37:17.540 --> 37:21.560
Reece Ryan Wade, no chance.

37:21.660 --> 37:25.840
It's a man's job learning
to stand in his truth.

37:25.940 --> 37:29.200
I hope if we have taught you anything

37:29.300 --> 37:31.120
it's that the love of God seeks us

37:31.220 --> 37:35.400
in every situation and desires our good.

37:35.500 --> 37:39.685
If He is in your dreams,
nothing can stand against 'em.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.160
What?

37:45.260 --> 37:47.442
This ain't the call for me.

37:52.580 --> 37:54.880
But you got the gift.

37:54.980 --> 37:57.280
Everyone, your teacher says so.

37:57.380 --> 37:59.721
But not me, Daddy.

38:00.940 --> 38:05.280
Ryan, the worst mistakes we make

38:05.380 --> 38:07.240
are the decisions that
are made in haste,

38:07.340 --> 38:09.640
you understand?

38:09.740 --> 38:13.080
Let's just slow it down here
and finish the school year...

38:13.180 --> 38:16.887
Daddy, Daddy.
I've already withdrawn.

38:23.060 --> 38:26.800
Ryan, you dropped out of school?

38:26.900 --> 38:29.082
I dropped out yesterday.

38:33.740 --> 38:35.365
Daddy, I...

38:50.700 --> 38:52.245
Ryan...

38:54.140 --> 38:56.288
I don't know what to say.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.800
Okay.

39:07.900 --> 39:11.641
Well, this is your life.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.249
You're a man now, I guess.

39:21.060 --> 39:24.640
What... what's your plan?

39:24.740 --> 39:26.480
What are you going to do?

39:26.580 --> 39:30.560
Want to live for a while,
be me for once.

39:30.660 --> 39:31.960
And you haven't been yourself,

39:32.060 --> 39:34.120
is that what you're saying?

39:34.220 --> 39:36.560
I'm not going to subsidize this.

39:36.660 --> 39:38.920
You understand that, right?

39:39.020 --> 39:42.124
I didn't expect you to.

39:44.060 --> 39:46.440
I found an apartment off the square.

39:46.540 --> 39:49.320
Okay, I guess you
got it all figured out.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.284
I'm sorry.

39:53.140 --> 39:56.040
I'm just trying to be
what He made me to be,

39:56.140 --> 39:58.527
not something else.

40:02.540 --> 40:05.371
You're breaking my heart, boy.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.485
Sign here please.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.760
Jenny?

40:37.580 --> 40:38.841
Heh.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.800
Anybody ever tell you you look
just like Drexel Hemsley?

40:47.900 --> 40:50.880
Yes, Miss.

40:50.980 --> 40:52.440
I have heard that before.

40:52.540 --> 40:55.640
I thought you was him.
His mama right upstairs...

40:55.740 --> 40:58.560
Cheryl! You didn't hear that, okay?

41:00.540 --> 41:02.722
It's supposed to be a secret,
for obvious reasons.

41:05.740 --> 41:07.560
Hello, Ryan.

41:07.660 --> 41:10.560
So you're a nurse.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.127
Yeah, I am.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.528
How was the army?

41:19.060 --> 41:20.730
It was fine.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.960
Hey...

41:26.060 --> 41:29.440
would you maybe want to
get together sometime,

41:29.540 --> 41:33.840
grab a cup of coffee or something?

41:33.940 --> 41:35.600
Oh I...

41:35.700 --> 41:39.880
Sorry, I'm kind of seeing somebody.

41:39.980 --> 41:42.606
Well, it's okay.

41:45.940 --> 41:48.000
It's good to see you, Ryan.

41:48.100 --> 41:51.329
It's really good to see you, Jenny.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.680
You look great.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.405
Thanks.

43:19.740 --> 43:21.968
Father...

43:23.420 --> 43:26.490
bless this dear lady.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.724
Hello.

43:37.780 --> 43:42.760
Your son, his music means a lot to me,

43:42.860 --> 43:45.640
and I just wanted to see you,

43:45.740 --> 43:48.571
say a little prayer.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.207
I'll just go. It's okay.

44:08.660 --> 44:14.449
<i>I can see your picture in my mind</i>

44:16.380 --> 44:23.600
<i>A vision that seems so very real</i>

44:23.700 --> 44:31.000
<i>I miss you every night in my dreams</i>

44:31.100 --> 44:38.000
<i>Time and space never keep us apart</i>

44:38.100 --> 44:41.880
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

44:41.980 --> 44:47.484
<i>Even when we're far away</i>

44:49.260 --> 44:51.362
Dexter.

45:24.100 --> 45:27.760
I didn't know then.
But I know now.

45:27.860 --> 45:32.040
That something inside
of Ryan died that day.

45:32.140 --> 45:39.000
<i>I can see your picture in my mind</i>

45:39.100 --> 45:46.800
<i>A vision that seems so very real</i>

45:46.900 --> 45:55.044
<i>I miss you every night in my dreams</i>

46:17.940 --> 46:19.400
You still hiring?

46:19.500 --> 46:22.920
I thought you had a job?

46:23.020 --> 46:25.720
I think I'd rather work here.

46:25.820 --> 46:28.680
Well, thinking is what got you here.

46:28.780 --> 46:31.000
Why don't you go in the
car and start her up.

46:31.100 --> 46:33.771
You started five minutes ago.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.800
They're beautiful, Ryan.
Thank you.

46:38.900 --> 46:41.800
It was great to see you too.

46:41.900 --> 46:45.360
But like I said, I'm seeing someone.

46:45.460 --> 46:48.280
I mean, I'm... sorry.

46:48.380 --> 46:50.200
You take care though, okay?

46:50.300 --> 46:52.280
Yeah. Bye.

46:52.380 --> 46:55.290
Okay, bye.

47:01.580 --> 47:03.760
The boy that sent you the flowers?

47:03.860 --> 47:05.440
Yup.

47:05.540 --> 47:08.600
The one who looked as good
as Drexel Hemsley himself

47:08.700 --> 47:10.080
just asked you out?

47:11.300 --> 47:13.760
And he's your old boyfriend?

47:13.860 --> 47:15.440
Well, we went out once.

47:15.540 --> 47:18.360
Six years ago, but it was a doozy.

47:18.460 --> 47:19.800
How you going to get to know him again

47:19.900 --> 47:21.760
if you don't go out on a date?

47:21.860 --> 47:23.840
Well, who says I want to
get to know him again?

47:23.940 --> 47:26.327
Your eyes, girl, that's who.

47:28.580 --> 47:33.000
Oh, why so verklempt, man?

47:33.100 --> 47:35.160
She said no.

47:35.260 --> 47:38.640
Man. You sent her flowers, right?

47:38.740 --> 47:40.320
Just like you told me.

47:40.420 --> 47:43.520
And the card.
What'd the card say?

47:43.620 --> 47:45.360
From me.

47:45.460 --> 47:49.240
No man. You got to say
stuff like, "I miss you.

47:49.340 --> 47:53.720
"Give me a second chance.
Roses are red. I love you.

47:53.820 --> 47:55.800
I long to be with you."

47:55.900 --> 47:57.800
She's got a boyfriend.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.360
It don't matter. You need to
make her laugh, make her smile.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.080
Girls don't get the
attention they deserve.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.760
You've got to pump up
the volume, or walk away.

48:04.860 --> 48:07.200
It's not time to lower your standards.

48:07.300 --> 48:08.480
It's time to up them.

48:08.580 --> 48:10.444
What am I supposed to do?

48:15.100 --> 48:19.040
<i>Angel of my life</i>

48:19.140 --> 48:22.000
<i>My loving angel</i>

48:22.100 --> 48:26.680
<i>You're all I need</i>

48:26.780 --> 48:34.760
<i>You came into my life when I was alone</i>

48:34.860 --> 48:38.680
<i>Made me believe I wasn't low</i>

48:38.780 --> 48:41.000
<i>I wasn't low</i>

48:41.100 --> 48:43.280
<i>Made me believe</i>

48:43.380 --> 48:47.640
<i>Angel of my life</i>

48:47.740 --> 48:50.200
<i>My loving angel</i>

48:50.300 --> 48:53.160
<i>You're like a dream</i>

48:53.260 --> 48:54.840
<i>Just like a dream</i>

48:54.940 --> 49:00.720
<i>But here you are, and you are real</i>

49:00.820 --> 49:01.960
<i>I'm loving you</i>

49:02.060 --> 49:02.920
<i>Loving you</i>

49:03.020 --> 49:06.360
<i>Loving me</i>

49:06.460 --> 49:07.920
How did you find me?

49:08.020 --> 49:11.040
Your friend...
Cheryl helped a little bit.

49:11.140 --> 49:12.640
I'm going to kill her.

49:12.740 --> 49:16.040
Coffee. Just a cup of coffee.

49:16.140 --> 49:19.440
Look. I know a lot of songs,

49:19.540 --> 49:23.600
and I'll sing every one
of them, until you say yes.

49:23.700 --> 49:26.280
Kid the jig's up.
Here comes the heat.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.280
Might this be the
disturbing the peace call?

49:28.380 --> 49:30.280
You called the cops on me?

49:30.380 --> 49:32.080
Oh, I didn't call them.

49:32.180 --> 49:35.040
And why are there always police
involved with you and me?

49:35.140 --> 49:38.160
Officer, look.
I ain't going anywhere,

49:38.260 --> 49:43.240
until this girl agrees to
go out on a date with me

49:43.340 --> 49:44.840
or you arrest me.

49:44.940 --> 49:46.840
I have a boyfriend!

49:46.940 --> 49:50.120
Then where is he?
Because he ain't here,

49:50.220 --> 49:52.440
and he ain't the one singing
you love songs tonight.

49:52.540 --> 49:56.040
Miss, just a cup of joe with the boy.

49:56.140 --> 49:57.401
What would it hurt?

49:59.820 --> 50:02.960
Sorry, pal, let's go!

50:03.060 --> 50:07.520
Okay! Coffee. One cup.

50:07.620 --> 50:11.800
But only if your backup singer
agrees to go with us.

50:14.060 --> 50:17.721
Son, kiss the bride!

50:22.580 --> 50:26.560
Well, let's just say that
was one good cup of coffee.

50:26.660 --> 50:29.360
In August of 1960,

50:29.460 --> 50:33.120
our lives began as
Mr. and Mrs. Ryan Wade.

50:33.220 --> 50:35.040
And time marched on.

50:35.140 --> 50:39.160
Ryan and I settled into a nice,
little small town routine,

50:39.260 --> 50:41.000
and built our life together.

50:41.100 --> 50:43.800
Ryan fixing cars with Avi,

50:43.900 --> 50:46.720
pretending he'd found his calling.

50:46.820 --> 50:51.520
<i>Fun, fun, fun in the sun</i>

50:51.620 --> 50:55.560
<i>Good vibrations everywhere</i>

50:55.660 --> 51:00.760
<i>Dance, dance, dance in the sand</i>

51:00.860 --> 51:04.806
<i>Sun's reflections, ocean tan</i>

51:08.620 --> 51:12.760
<i>Girls and boys are everywhere</i>

51:12.860 --> 51:16.320
<i>Sunrise surfin'</i>

51:16.420 --> 51:21.480
<i>Love is floating in the air</i>

51:21.580 --> 51:25.844
<i>Sunrise surfin'</i>

51:30.220 --> 51:32.560
It's 8:55 and 70 degrees.

51:32.660 --> 51:34.280
The weather after the news.

51:34.380 --> 51:37.360
The big news? War broke out in
the Middle East this morning.

51:37.460 --> 51:38.240
It has spread now through

51:38.340 --> 51:40.520
the Israeli port city of Haifa
on the Mediterranean.

51:40.620 --> 51:43.640
Syria sent its planes to bomb
the Haifa oil refinery,

51:43.740 --> 51:44.960
leaving it in flames.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.840
Three Israeli planes were shot down

51:46.940 --> 51:49.000
in a dogfight with Jordanian jets.

51:49.100 --> 51:51.800
Three Syrian MiGs attacked
the city of Magneto.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.160
In other news...

51:53.260 --> 51:55.800
What does that have to do

51:55.900 --> 52:00.280
with the Christian church
in the state of Tennessee?

52:00.380 --> 52:02.160
Everything!

52:02.260 --> 52:05.921
It has to do with everything!

52:07.100 --> 52:10.920
We are commanded by the word of God,

52:11.020 --> 52:14.920
to give him no rest from our prayers.

52:15.020 --> 52:19.921
For who? Today, for Israel.

52:21.740 --> 52:24.760
Our precious Lord and savior

52:24.860 --> 52:27.804
was himself a Jew!

52:29.620 --> 52:31.760
If we love God,

52:31.860 --> 52:35.240
we must love what God loves.

52:35.340 --> 52:38.280
And God loves his chosen people!

52:40.820 --> 52:44.200
I've symbolically lit

52:44.300 --> 52:47.480
the eight candles of
the Hanukkah menorah.

52:47.580 --> 52:53.722
God's people need that
Hanukkah miracle again.

52:57.500 --> 53:01.640
Israel won the war.
A modern day miracle.

53:01.740 --> 53:04.960
But our miracle,
to have a family of our own,

53:05.060 --> 53:07.680
apparently wasn't meant to be.

53:07.780 --> 53:10.680
The doctors said Ryan
and I would never have

53:10.780 --> 53:13.042
one of these precious gifts.

53:18.940 --> 53:21.760
He just seems so directionless.

53:21.860 --> 53:24.680
He needs something beyond
just making a living.

53:24.780 --> 53:26.440
A calling perhaps?

53:26.540 --> 53:28.680
It's time.

53:28.780 --> 53:31.000
It's time to tell him the truth.

53:31.100 --> 53:36.000
Every night, I see that man's face,

53:36.100 --> 53:39.680
making me give my word

53:39.780 --> 53:41.720
not to say anything

53:41.820 --> 53:44.969
until they're both gone.

53:46.660 --> 53:51.080
It's been a thorn in my
side for 31 years, mother.

53:51.180 --> 53:55.080
I think about it.
Every day.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.440
The truth shall set you free.

53:56.540 --> 53:59.450
He has a right to know who he is.

54:05.460 --> 54:09.240
<i>Girls and boys are everywhere</i>

54:09.340 --> 54:13.960
<i>Sunrise surfin'</i>

54:14.060 --> 54:17.840
<i>Love is floating in the air</i>

54:17.940 --> 54:22.680
<i>- Sunrise surfin'</i>
- Are you sure about this?

54:22.780 --> 54:26.440
I have never been so sure in my life.

54:26.540 --> 54:30.960
<i>I got a great, big love for you</i>

54:31.060 --> 54:34.160
<i>You're one of a kind,
You're gonna be mine</i>

54:34.260 --> 54:39.491
<i>It's the last thing I'm ever gonna do</i>

54:44.900 --> 54:47.280
Whoo!

54:47.380 --> 54:48.520
I don't believe this.

54:48.620 --> 54:49.880
Dino!

54:49.980 --> 54:53.400
Ryan?

54:53.500 --> 54:56.160
Ryan, my main man!
Pots and pans!

54:56.260 --> 54:58.520
- What is shakin' bacon?
- Man, how are you?

54:58.620 --> 55:01.720
I'm good man! And Jenny.

55:01.820 --> 55:03.760
Aw man, if I only had me a Jenny,

55:03.860 --> 55:07.280
I wouldn't be spending so
much money on alimony, huh?

55:07.380 --> 55:09.320
How you been man?

55:09.420 --> 55:11.040
Man I'm fine. I'm fine.
Is this your gig now?

55:11.140 --> 55:13.160
Oh no. I just play where they pay.

55:13.260 --> 55:16.640
I've been all over.
Florida, New Orleans. California.

55:16.740 --> 55:17.960
Psychedelic sound's where it's at.

55:18.060 --> 55:18.840
This is cool.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.000
You're going to be backing
me up in a minute.

55:21.100 --> 55:23.120
Son, that's going to be
like shooting fish in a barrel.

55:23.220 --> 55:25.080
- You serious?
- Just for fun man.

55:25.180 --> 55:26.960
You know it's all her idea.

55:27.060 --> 55:28.600
I'll lay you down a beat, right?

55:28.700 --> 55:31.560
You just do what you do.
Just like old times.

55:31.660 --> 55:35.048
<i>Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go</i>

55:36.780 --> 55:40.441
<i>Beboppin' baby, shake, a rock 'n roll</i>

55:42.460 --> 55:46.121
<i>You can ask her to dance,
but she don't wanna dance slow</i>

55:47.860 --> 55:51.806
<i>Beboppin' baby, girl,
you got me in a spin</i>

55:53.700 --> 55:56.770
<i>Beboppin' baby, let the party begin</i>

55:58.820 --> 56:00.520
<i>She's movin' so fast</i>

56:00.620 --> 56:02.688
<i>You're gonna think that she's a twin</i>

56:04.020 --> 56:06.000
<i>Hey, girl, slow down</i>

56:06.100 --> 56:09.440
<i>I want to get to know ya</i>

56:09.540 --> 56:12.040
<i>I know that I can show ya</i>

56:12.140 --> 56:14.840
<i>You're the girl for me,
yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

56:14.940 --> 56:18.000
<i>Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go</i>

56:18.100 --> 56:19.640
So let's not do "Bee-bopping Baby."

56:19.740 --> 56:22.520
That's what the Georgia
guy's going to do.

56:22.620 --> 56:24.400
You know what,
everybody's talking about him.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.400
He's like really good.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.000
Oh but he's not as good as you.

56:28.100 --> 56:31.160
Now they'll probably go
in alphabetical order.

56:31.260 --> 56:34.840
And that puts Ryan Wade last,
which is perfect!

56:34.940 --> 56:38.240
I get the feeling,

56:38.340 --> 56:40.200
you think that I can
actually win this thing.

56:40.300 --> 56:43.324
I do, and you will.

56:44.260 --> 56:45.600
Hey Ho!

56:47.860 --> 56:49.960
Come on!

56:50.060 --> 56:52.000
Whoo!

56:52.100 --> 56:56.364
Hello, Nashville!

56:57.900 --> 57:00.002
Whoo!

57:03.460 --> 57:06.280
Are you ready to rock?

57:08.020 --> 57:11.360
I said are you ready to rock?

57:11.460 --> 57:13.440
Well, grab onto your britches,

57:13.540 --> 57:15.920
boys and girls. Ha!

57:16.020 --> 57:20.400
We're going to rock this place
like a hurricane. Come on!

57:20.500 --> 57:23.251
Come on!

57:25.060 --> 57:28.320
Hey. Hey, man.
Can I get a bourbon?

57:28.420 --> 57:30.440
In a...

57:32.540 --> 57:35.120
You know what, why don't you throw
me down a Shirley Temple instead.

57:35.220 --> 57:37.620
- How much is ginger ale?
- 15 cents ma'am.

57:37.720 --> 57:39.160
Thank you. We'll share one.

57:39.260 --> 57:42.600
I'll have what he was going
to have, but make it a double.

57:42.700 --> 57:46.440
<i>A gypsy man, I'll always be</i>

57:46.540 --> 57:49.880
<i>It is just a part of me</i>

57:49.980 --> 57:54.440
<i>They say that I should settle down</i>

57:54.540 --> 58:00.170
<i>There's only once place...</i>

58:01.140 --> 58:02.571
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

58:05.260 --> 58:10.880
<i>I was born for a reason,
not just breathing air</i>

58:10.980 --> 58:16.200
<i>Born for a reason,
got something to share</i>

58:16.300 --> 58:20.880
<i>I'll make no bones about it,
sure as I'm sittin' here</i>

58:20.980 --> 58:24.560
<i>I was born for a reason</i>

58:29.860 --> 58:32.520
Ooh!

58:32.620 --> 58:38.440
That was... out of Mobile,
bringing everything

58:38.540 --> 58:39.971
with the Drexel smash.

58:52.140 --> 58:54.320
Slap the dog and spit in the fire,

58:54.420 --> 58:57.160
that boy looks like our child.

59:03.820 --> 59:07.845
<i>Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go</i>

59:10.100 --> 59:12.885
<i>Beboppin' baby, shake, a rock 'n roll</i>

59:14.900 --> 59:16.360
<i>You can ask her to dance</i>

59:16.460 --> 59:19.960
<i>But she don't want to dance slow</i>

59:20.060 --> 59:24.529
<i>Beboppin' baby,
girl you got me in a spin</i>

59:26.980 --> 59:30.200
<i>Beboppin' baby, let the party begin</i>

59:36.780 --> 59:39.920
Who are you?

59:40.020 --> 59:42.120
The Volunteer state of
Tennessee put your hands

59:42.220 --> 59:46.803
and screams together for Mr. Ryan Wade!

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.763
<i>Ooh</i>

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:16.881
<i>I can see your picture in my mind</i>

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:24.841
<i>A vision that seems so very real</i>

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:34.560
<i>I miss you every night in my dreams</i>

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:40.600
<i>Time and space never keep us apart</i>

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.480
<i>Ahh</i>

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:48.680
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.880
<i>Ahh</i>

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:57.080
<i>Even when we're far away</i>

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.600
<i>Ahh</i>

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:05.120
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.400
<i>Ahh</i>

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:13.160
<i>Until the morning brings another day</i>

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.045
<i>Brings another day</i>

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.760
<i>Ooh, it's a brand new day</i>

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:37.800
<i>I can feel your touch like you are here</i>

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:46.200
<i>A perfect love will cast away my fears</i>

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:54.360
<i>I can hear your voice
blowin' in the wind</i>

01:01:54.460 --> 01:02:01.250
<i>Your love will turn
the darkness into light</i>

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:09.523
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:17.568
<i>Even when we're far away</i>

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:25.171
<i>Your love's keeping me tonight</i>

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:34.090
<i>Until the morning brings another day</i>

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.003
Whoo!

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.525
That's your winner.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.880
- I'm going to go talk to Mama okay?
- All right!

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.480
- All right. Have fun.
- I'll stay here.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.411
Mama!

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.120
I've never seen so much
money in my whole life.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.720
Much less at once.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.600
Oh man, that was great.
Wasn't that great?

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.240
That was so great.
You did it.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.568
You did great.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.842
Mr. Wade.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.840
Great show tonight, sir.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.200
Thank you, sir.
"Mr. Tony Nash, Management."

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.080
I can have you play in
every major state fair

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.560
in the region next month
if you're interested.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.560
Oh, he's interested!

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.160
Good. Look, Ryan, why don't you
come by my office Monday, okay?

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.800
- Thank you, sir. Monday?
- Monday.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.360
All right, I'll see you there.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.480
I've never seen anything
like that tonight.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.680
It was absolutely incredible.

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.520
Be good.
Have a nice night.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.200
Thank you.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.920
What just happened?

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.280
I think he got a job.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.360
Look, it's not rocket science.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.120
I get you booked.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.000
Get you paid.
You give me 15%.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.640
You can fire me any time you like.

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.120
Has anyone ever? Fired you.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.520
It's kind of an
occupational hazard, ma'am.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.000
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to get my head

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.680
wrapped around people paying good money

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.160
to see someone act like somebody else.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.760
Well, they do.
People love this guy.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.360
They can't get enough of him.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.720
And you're about as
close to the real thing

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.080
as I've ever seen.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.880
So you can get me booked places?

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.440
Tennessee state fair is already
holding a spot for you.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.720
Arkansas and Texas after that.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.760
I haven't heard back yet from
Kansas City but it'll be a yes.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.240
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.920
You will not believe your eyes
or your ears when I tell you

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.080
who this isn't,

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.400
but you are going to love him anyway.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.640
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.001
for The identical!

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:15.080
Well, thank you very much, Nashville!

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.400
Right now we'd like to do a
song I think ya'll might know.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.680
It goes like this.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.360
<i>It's a long way to Nashville</i>

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.520
<i>To the Vegas neon lights</i>

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.040
<i>I had to give my heart and soul</i>

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.600
<i>You know, it's been an uphill fight</i>

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.560
<i>Headed to dreamland...</i>

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.360
Oh, come on people, don't be stupid.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.880
We got a job to do here.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.160
Hey, what's going on?

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.440
It's closing weekend.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.000
Final judging of the livestock.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.520
Wow.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.840
Looks like either that
or Wayne Newton, right?

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.166
Heh.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.720
Drexel!

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.448
Oh, man.
I think this boy's a star.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.368
<i>To Nashville tonight</i>

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.400
<i>To Nashville tonight</i>

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:36.084
<i>Ooh, to Nashville tonight</i>

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:43.040
<i>To Nashville tonight
To Nashville tonight</i>

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:48.849
<i>Ooh, Nashville tonight</i>

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:02.760
<i>A gypsy man, that's who I am</i>

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.600
<i>I do things my own way</i>

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.000
<i>I might be here for a little while</i>

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.840
<i>But I know that I won't stay</i>

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.203
<i>I'm a gypsy man</i>

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.320
<i>A gypsy man, I'll always be</i>

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:25.000
<i>It is just a part of me</i>

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.800
<i>They say that I should settle down</i>

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:35.720
<i>But there are so many places,
so many towns, yeah</i>

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:38.002
<i>Ooh</i>

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:44.000
<i>Something 'bout ya that I feel</i>

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.400
<i>It makes me want to stay</i>

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:51.360
<i>Girl, when you put your love on me</i>

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:56.760
<i>I just got to stay, I'm a gypsy man</i>

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.080
<i>Yes, I am</i>

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.640
<i>A gypsy man, I'll always be</i>

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:06.400
<i>It is just a part of me</i>

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:10.040
<i>They say that I should settle down</i>

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:16.319
<i>But there are so many places,
so many towns</i>

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.240
<i>Oh, I got a lot of places to see</i>

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.560
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.171
<i>Ooh</i>

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.520
I want you to be proud of me, Daddy.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:37.439
I am proud of you, Ryan.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.720
I am proud of you.

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:44.481
Was this what you really wanted, really?

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.881
I don't know.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.439
Ryan took his act as far as it could go.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.600
Doing 200 dates a year
was beginning to feel

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.960
like a man running on a hamster wheel.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:11.399
But still, it wasn't
without its rewards.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:17.000
<i>I feel I know you</i>

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.760
<i>I wish that I could show you</i>

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:26.520
<i>There's something that I'm feeling</i>

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:43.640
<i>That it's real, I feel like I know you</i>

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:48.680
<i>I wish that I could show you</i>

01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:50.920
Wow.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.680
That was great.
That was great.

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.240
Thanks.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.680
Well...

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.360
You know you missed three cues tonight.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.440
You'll leave one off
the set list entirely,

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.880
but we've got time to
rehearse other songs.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.520
So what was that anyway?

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.480
It's one of mine.
It's an original.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.640
Oh, an original.
Cool!

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.240
I want to work it into one of our sets.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.160
Forget it.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.400
Forget that?

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.240
That's right, forget it.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.200
These people are paying
to hear Drexel "The Dream,"

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.731
not Ryan the Dream.

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.120
Oh, I see, creative discretion.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.280
No, it's we're booked two years out

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.600
doing Drexel and Drexel only.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.480
I mean, you're printing money.

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.440
You're making enough money to support

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.920
five of Dino's ex-wives on top
of the two he's already got.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.760
And all of you, you just
want to walk off a cliff

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.520
and kill this golden goose.

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.080
You know, it ain't always
about the money, Tony.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.120
Grow up, Ryan.
You know what,

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.400
this is what you guys have been doing
instead of rehearsing the show?

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.640
You know what, it shows.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.440
What are you talking about?

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.560
I'm talking about you all
getting fat and lazy,

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.520
that's what I'm talking about.
You're not hungry anymore.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:58.280
Look, Tony, I'm sick and tired
of doing the same songs

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.800
the same way 200 shows a year.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.680
Being somebody I'm not.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.800
Well, unfortunately that's
what you signed on for,

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.800
and that's what you are.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.640
What is the big deal?

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.520
I just want to work some of my songs in.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.600
Nobody wants to hear your songs, Ryan!

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.160
You don't know that.

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.171
All right.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.520
Shall I spell it out for you, Ryan?

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.640
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.880
I didn't sign Ryan Wade the artist.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.880
I signed Ryan Wade
"The identical."

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:38.051
The best Drexel impersonator
I'd ever heard or seen.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:46.000
And I've worked too hard
to let you destroy it.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.720
You want to work on your own
songs on your own time,

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.360
that's your business.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.280
This right here,

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.520
this is my business, son.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.520
You can't talk to me like that.

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.920
You were a rich turner singing in

01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.920
the church choir when I found you.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.160
Back off, Tony.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.400
Hey, I made you, Ryan Wade,

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.800
and don't you ever forget it.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.891
You didn't make anything.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.280
It's over, Tony.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.880
I quit.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.720
You quit?

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.200
Well, go on and quit.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.400
Ryan, there's only one Elvis.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.600
There's one Drexel and
there's one Beatles,

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:25.400
and you're a pretender, buddy.
You're a nothing!

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.285
Nobody's ever going to sign you.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.720
I'm home.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.365
Hi.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.560
It was like starting all over again

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:54.000
and falling in love for the first time.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.840
For just a little while,

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.040
we were both living our dream, together.

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.920
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:08.200
<i>Reminds me of the love we knew</i>

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.840
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.920
<i>I see your smilin' eyes a'blue</i>

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:20.120
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:23.880
<i>Reminds me of a love we knew</i>

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.760
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.645
<i>I see your smilin' eyes a'blue</i>

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:36.240
<i>Country boy, city girl</i>

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.120
<i>We were like night and day</i>

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.920
<i>I took her to the country</i>

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.203
<i>But she just wouldn't stay</i>

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.240
Yes, sir.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.600
Yeah, absolutely, I'll be there.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.167
Thank you, sir. Bye.

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:04.563
City of Peace Records wants
to meet with me tomorrow.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.965
Whoo!

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:12.920
We believe City Lights is a smash hit.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.200
Now, Ryan,

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.006
I want you to hear me, brother.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.000
I'm prepared to give you $25,000
right now for your song.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.280
Take it in the studio

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:35.600
and cut it on The Dream himself.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.280
Drexel Hemsley.

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.767
Now how does that sound to you.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:47.040
It's a mighty generous offer,

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.527
but I just want to record my own music.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.050
It's not about the money.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.490
It never was.

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.167
Okay, $50,000!

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.080
Some dreams maybe
just aren't meant to be.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.280
But dreams take a backseat
to just plain health.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.280
It all came to a head
one September morning.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:26.530
Actually, everything came
to a head that day.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.681
I'm here, Dexter. I'm here.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:48.650
Why you and not me?

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.560
I don't get it, man.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.840
Listen, I don't care what they say,

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.080
you're still the greatest
singer I ever heard.

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.406
Ever.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.046
Ryan!

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.800
Ryan!

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.520
Two months after Drexel
Hemsley's untimely death,

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.520
the investigation of the cause
of the fatal crash continues.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.600
Thousands still gather outside the gates

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.080
of his former home, Dreamland.

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.840
Letters and cards overrun
the Nashville residence

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.247
on a daily basis.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:52.560
<i>You rain down from heaven above</i>

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:08.971
<i>Now I'm clear to see
what's happened to me</i>

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.480
Amen.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.920
Oh, it's so good to have you kids here.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.000
That is the sweetest dress on you.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.200
Why, thank you.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.880
And, honey, you look better.

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.440
Thank you, Mama.

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.480
Are you back work yet?

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.360
Not yet, Mama.
Not yet.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.040
Brother Wade, what's new at church?

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:35.120
Not much, really.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:39.211
Except the board asked
me to resign on Monday.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.280
Forty years.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.680
Forty years.
Practically built that place

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:51.840
with my own two hands.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:55.360
He used to go in his short
pants and start the coal fire

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.080
at five o'clock in the
morning before worship.

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.200
That's right.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.280
Now I can't even change the light bulb

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.280
without getting dizzy.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.640
Heh. Jenny, last month

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.000
I preached the best sermon
of my whole career.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.040
Oh, it was outstanding.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.600
And Ed Nichols reminds me,

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:17.720
I preached the same one a year ago.

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.480
And I said, "Brother Nichols,
what's wrong with that?

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.000
You just got blessed twice."

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:27.047
Oh yeah. It's time.

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.880
You ready for him to
be home all the time?

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:33.000
Oh, I been waiting many a year.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.480
But I finished the race.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.520
Wasn't always pretty,
sometimes it wasn't much fun.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.440
But I got there.

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.800
There isn't a better feeling
this side of heaven.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.527
Congratulations, Daddy.
Really.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.400
I want you to have that
same feeling, son.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.120
It's not too late.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.440
Oh, Daddy!
This isn't the time.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.680
Let's just have a calm
family supper without any...

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.200
No, now is the time!

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:08.000
He may be all grown up,
but we're his parents.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:12.720
What are you going to do, Ryan?

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.000
You going to sit inside the house

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.840
and mourn for the rest of your life?

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.480
You know what, y'all?

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:21.960
You will honor your father by listening.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.240
Whether you want to hear this or not.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:27.320
I have heard it, Daddy.
A hundred times.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.120
Why?

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.160
Why do you keep running from this, son?

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:35.200
God set you apart, son.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.482
No, He didn't!

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.840
Oh, I know the story, Daddy.

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.800
I know it real well.

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.720
You dedicated me to God.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.880
I know you have a vision for my life.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:54.600
Well, you know what?
It's not my vision, Daddy.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.120
The call you heard was for
your life, not mine, not for me.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:00.720
I'm trying to help you, son.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.280
Please, will you, contain yourself!

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.720
I'm trying to help the boy.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.440
Daddy, what's wrong?

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:09.080
Daddy? What is it, honey?

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.480
Oh dear!

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.400
Oh, Jenny!

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.040
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Daddy, what's wrong?

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.600
I think he's having a heart attack.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.160
Mom, you call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance, Mom.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.520
My pills!

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:19.920
I'll get them, Daddy, I'll get them.

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.240
- It's all right.
- Get my pills.

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.680
It's all right.

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.440
We're gettin' you help, honey.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.040
We'll ride with y'all.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.680
We're right here, honey.
We're right here.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.200
I'll follow, Mama.
I'm right behind you.

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.560
In the name of God
Almighty and Jesus Christ,

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.046
I command the Holy Spirit...

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:49.890
I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm sorry.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.560
Our dear son.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.840
If you are reading these words

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.567
it means your mother and I
have passed from this life.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.680
Time has come for you
to know who you are

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.326
and where you come from.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.920
You were born to a mama
and daddy who love you

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.488
but can't give you the life we want.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.880
We believe God has put you
here for something special

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:32.210
and we asked a man of God
to raise you up proper like.

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.360
You have an identical twin brother

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:40.450
who is reading a letter
just like yours right now.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:48.440
So forgive us and understand

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.960
this is what we had to do.

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:54.050
We love you and will see you in heaven.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.680
Your daddy, your momma,

01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:01.407
William and Helen Hemsley.

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.720
Hello?

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.600
It was a mild heart attack.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.200
He's going to be okay.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.960
Think of coming down?

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.040
No. Not right now.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.971
Ryan, your father wants to see you.

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.080
Honey?

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.000
Tell him I'm glad he's all right.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.640
Tell Mama...

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:46.880
tell her I know now, and I understand.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.640
Understand what?

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.444
She'll know.

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.529
Now, what can I get for you?

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.480
I...

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.603
How about a whiskey?

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:12.450
That will cure your ills, my friend.

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:20.360
Ryan? Ryan Wade?

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.131
Down here.

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.320
I can't believe this.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.360
Darling, darling,
do you know who this is?

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.120
No, baby.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.640
I told you I knew people.

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.160
Maybe now you'll be nicer to me.

01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.280
This is none other than The identical.

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.440
What are you doing here?

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.640
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:42.880
Name's Damon.

01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:47.200
I saw you once in Atlanta.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.760
Man, I about died. I thought
you was The Dream himself.

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:52.640
How did you get so dang good anyway?

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.640
Born to it I guess.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.720
Miss, if you don't mind

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.880
I'm going to trade this
in for something else.

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.160
- A Dr. Pepper or something.
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:05.249
Put it on my tab, darling.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.440
Gave it up, huh?

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.920
Man, that's a shame.

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.240
How did you get into this?

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.800
I was pouring drinks at his hotel once.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.920
He stopped and talked to me.

01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:25.560
Treated me like a real human being.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.240
Like he cared what I had to say.

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:30.284
First average size person ever did that.

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:33.849
Changed my life.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.720
I see you've still got your chai though,

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.120
just like his.

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:44.080
Yeah, why did he wear one?

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.960
- He was Jewish.
- What?

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.360
On his mother's side.
Look it up.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.720
Really?

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.560
A Christian and a Jew.
Same guy. Heh.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.320
He used to say he was
covering his bases.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.760
You believe that?
Isn't that great?

01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.246
Yeah.

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.688
You're looking for
something, aren't you?

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:09.840
Maybe.

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.280
Let me give you a
little hint, Ryan Wade.

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:19.080
It ain't here, but keep looking.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:23.080
You'll find it eventually.
Well, I'm up next.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.205
Stick around. You might
learn something, identical.

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.002
Got to go.

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:41.720
<i>I got a great, big love for you</i>

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:45.120
<i>I never been small,
I've always been tall</i>

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.760
<i>I got a great, big love for you</i>

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.600
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby</i>

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.360
<i>Come on now!</i>

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.409
<i>Give it to me</i>

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:11.243
<i>Oh, the hands are tied</i>

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:20.963
<i>Oh, I cannot see what's
right in front of me</i>

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:28.280
<i>Where in the world will I
be with my next step I take</i>

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:31.280
<i>Time, it keeps playing its tricks on me</i>

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.560
<i>As I move along, feel me get closer</i>

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:39.560
<i>'Cause I know this there's
something about ya</i>

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.080
<i>I can take a trip to see
all there is to see</i>

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.840
<i>I can be in jail then set free</i>

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.240
<i>Getting trashed by a queen,
laid out at her feet</i>

01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:56.604
<i>But in the end,
there's something about ya</i>

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.360
I'm sorry, baby.

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:56.320
I just thought it was some
kind of answer to prayer.

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.560
We'll figure something out.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.171
Okay?

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:07.402
Willie, I'll pray too.

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:14.080
William Hemsley's health
deteriorated after Helen died.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:16.880
Now with the passing of Drexel

01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:21.688
he was a frail and broken
man well beyond his years.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.290
I'm sorry, sir.
We're closing.

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:38.200
He had a brother.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.289
Dexter Ryan?

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.600
He only made it one day.

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.640
Where is he buried?

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.000
Out back, up the hill.

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.202
Thank you, ma'am.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:57.240
Ryan knew the car instantly

01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:00.400
that was parked by the
private Hemsley cemetery

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.800
and there's only one person

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.400
that would possibly take that limo

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.807
to visit those graves on this day.

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.568
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:17.600
Nobody really know'd him.

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:22.560
All the papers talk about
his mistakes, his weaknesses.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:25.600
Hell, like we ain't all got them.

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:29.930
Most people don't know this.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:34.400
He was born with an identical twin.

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.288
It was...

01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:49.884
it was a hard day.

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.690
It was a hard day.

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.484
My boy.

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.441
My perfect boy.

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.930
My sweet boy.

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.530
Forgive me.

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.480
You're already forgiven.
You know that.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:24.960
No. No, I ain't forgiven.
I ain't forgiven.

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.401
I ain't forgiven.

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.808
Mr. Hemsley...

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.765
I know it was a hard day.

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.400
See...

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.840
I was there.

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.200
It's me, Daddy.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:57.362
Dexter Ryan Hemsley.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.289
My son.

01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:07.970
My son.

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.969
My son.

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:45.160
<i>Angel of my life</i>

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:49.960
<i>You're all I need</i>

01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:53.920
<i>You came into my life</i>

01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:57.680
<i>When I was alone</i>

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:03.680
<i>Made me believe, I was alone</i>

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.928
<i>Made me believe</i>

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.880
You, working on the car?

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:33.003
Oh, praise Jesus.

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:37.080
It's supposed to be good for me.

01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:41.880
It's supposed to keep my...
to keep my mind active,

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:46.960
but... I think it's just a
complete waste of time.

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.760
I mean, you know me with this...

01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.320
I'll do it, Daddy.

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.560
I always told you I'd
wrestle you to the ground

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.240
before I let you ride
one of them things.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.767
You're too big for that now.

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.680
I wanted to tell you

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:12.280
so many times, Ryan... I...

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.840
I know, Daddy.

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:16.200
I just...

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.242
I know.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.800
There's something I've got to tell you.

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:23.128
Okay.

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.284
Thank you.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.120
And I mean thank you...

01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:39.244
for everything.

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.602
And I mean everything, Daddy.

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:46.888
Ryan.

01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:49.524
Oh...

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.722
You are my son.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:01.080
And you are more

01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:04.762
than I ever dared pray for.

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:10.360
I want you to follow your dream,

01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:12.927
your calling, not mine.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.841
Because you blessed me boy.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.640
You blessed me, Ryan.

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.448
And I'm sorry, son.
I'm sorry, son.

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:35.240
Ryan never let on to
anyone but his family

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.920
who he really was and
came to walk the path

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.080
of singing both his and
his brother's songs.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.960
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:58.040
<i>Reminds me of the love we knew</i>

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:01.840
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:06.360
<i>I see your smilin' eyes a'blue</i>

01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:10.080
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:14.680
<i>Reminds me of the love we knew</i>

01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.480
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.680
<i>I see your smilin' eyes a'blue</i>

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:25.720
<i>Country boy, city girl</i>

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.560
<i>We were like night and day</i>

01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:33.600
<i>I took her to the country</i>

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:37.440
<i>But she just wouldn't stay</i>

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:41.320
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:45.760
<i>She was a dancer on the stage of life</i>

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:49.120
<i>City lights keep on shining</i>

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.720
<i>All I wanted was a wife</i>

01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:57.040
<i>Shining, shining</i>

01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:01.120
<i>Shining on you and me</i>

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:04.800
<i>Shining, shining</i>

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:08.243
<i>Shining like it used to be</i>

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:11.000
I guess it's true.

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:15.967
If He is in our dreams,
no one can stand against them.

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.360
<i>It don't come easy</i>

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:33.680
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:37.360
<i>It don't come easy</i>

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:41.720
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:45.520
<i>Got to pay your dues
if you wanna sing the blues</i>

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:49.600
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.720
<i>You don't have to shout or leap about</i>

01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.720
<i>You can even play them easy</i>

01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:03.848
<i>Forget about the past
and all your sorrows</i>

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.720
<i>The future won't last</i>

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:14.480
<i>It will soon be over tomorrow</i>

01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:17.200
<i>It don't come easy</i>

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:21.720
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:25.280
<i>It don't come easy</i>

01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:30.040
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.560
<i>I don't ask for much</i>

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.920
<i>I only want trust</i>

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.320
<i>And you know it don't come easy</i>

01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:41.560
<i>And this love of mine
keeps growing all the time</i>

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:45.800
<i>And you know it just ain't easy</i>

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:54.120
<i>Open up your heart, let's come together</i>

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.800
<i>Use a little love</i>

01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:02.609
<i>And we will make it work out better</i>

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:08.360
<i>Ooh, easy</i>

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.400
<i>Yeah</i>

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:13.280
<i>Ooh</i>

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:18.344
<i>It don't come easy
You know it don't come easy</i>

01:40:18.444 --> 01:40:21.280
<i>Ooh It don't come easy</i>

01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.760
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:29.360
<i>It don't come easy</i>

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:33.920
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.640
<i>Peace, remember peace</i>

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:41.600
<i>Is how we make it</i>

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:44.760
<i>Here within your reach</i>

01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:50.000
<i>If you're big enough to take it</i>

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.320
<i>It don't come easy</i>

01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:58.367
<i>You know it don't come easy</i>

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:29.164
<i>I wanted to let you know</i>

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:34.080
<i>What you mean to me</i>

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.965
<i>So I wrote a little song</i>

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.800
<i>What I'm trying to say to you, darling</i>

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.120
<i>Is that I miss you</i>

01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.971
<i>Now that you are gone</i>

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:57.480
<i>I know I let love slip away</i>

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:02.766
<i>It's like trying to hold onto
a runaway train</i>

01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:10.520
<i>Seems like I've been walking
down lonely road</i>

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:15.567
<i>Like a blind man,
I can't find my way back home</i>

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:19.800
<i>Everybody knows it</i>

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.160
<i>Everybody wants it</i>

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:28.800
<i>Everybody needs to know
they have somebody to love</i>

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.680
<i>Everybody feels it</i>

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:36.280
<i>Everybody sees it</i>

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:42.283
<i>Everybody needs to know
they have somebody to love</i>

01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:49.680
<i>The clock upon the wall</i>

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:52.520
<i>Reads 2:00 am</i>

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.327
<i>And I'm still hoping that you'll call</i>

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.921
<i>The minutes turn to hours</i>

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:09.600
<i>And hours in to days</i>

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.320
<i>Oh!</i>

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:16.040
<i>Slow down, I'm gonna ride that pony</i>

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:21.451
<i>And put the music back in our song</i>

01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:29.080
<i>I want you to know I'm feeling...</i>

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:33.880
<i>Now we can...</i>

01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:35.880
<i>Ooh</i>

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.800
<i>Everybody knows it</i>

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.960
<i>Everybody wants it</i>

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.166
<i>Everybody needs to know
they have somebody to love</i>

01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:51.080
<i>Everybody feels it</i>

01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:55.480
<i>Everybody sees it</i>

01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:01.400
<i>Everybody needs to know
they have somebody to love</i>

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.640
<i>Everybody knows it</i>

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:08.259
<i>Everybody wants it</i>

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.727
