08:58.333 --> 09:00.792
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY NIGHT.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.208
WE DO?

09:04.208 --> 09:05.625
YEAH. YOU SAVED MY LIFE
THAT NIGHT,

09:05.625 --> 09:08.583
MY LIFE AND
POSSIBLY MY CAREER--

09:08.583 --> 09:10.208
NEITHER OF WHICH
ARE SO IMPRESSIVE

09:10.208 --> 09:11.708
THAT THEY DESERVE
TO BE SAVED, BUT...

09:12.708 --> 09:16.708
UH, I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS...

09:16.708 --> 09:19.542
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
WHY YOU DIDN'T COME BACK
THAT NIGHT.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.291
I JUST NEED TO SAY
THANK YOU.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.708
[DOOR OPENS]

09:24.708 --> 09:27.875
OH, SORRY, DAVID.

09:27.875 --> 09:28.708
JOEY?

09:31.708 --> 09:34.041

09:35.333 --> 09:37.667
SEE YOU IN CLASS.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.583
THANKS.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.083
OK, FINE.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.959
PACEY.

09:58.959 --> 10:01.166
WHY ARE YOU THROWING ROCKS
AT MY WINDOW?

10:01.166 --> 10:02.125
THAT'S NOT JEN'S WINDOW?

10:02.125 --> 10:03.625
[LAUGHS] NO.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.208
OH. [LAUGHS]

10:05.208 --> 10:06.417
EH, MY BAD.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.333
LOOK, COULD YOU
JUST SEND HER DOWN?

10:07.333 --> 10:08.959
WHO, JEN?
NO, AUDREY.

10:08.959 --> 10:09.500
JUST TELL HER
I'M BACK.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.250
I'M RESTED,

10:11.250 --> 10:12.333
AND I AM READY
TO ARGUE.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.750
YOU CAME HERE
LOOKING FOR AUDREY?

10:13.750 --> 10:15.333
YEAH. LOOK,
I KNOW FOR A FACT

10:15.333 --> 10:16.208
THAT'S SHE'S GOING
TO THAT CONCERT THING

10:16.208 --> 10:17.417
WITH JEN TONIGHT,

10:17.417 --> 10:18.083
AND I'M SURE
THEY'RE JUST IN THERE

10:18.083 --> 10:18.917
PIMPING AWAY RIGHT NOW.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.917
PRIMPING,
NOT--NOT PIMPING.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.250
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.542
OH, HO, A LITTLE
AGITATED THERE, BUDDY.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.750
YES, I AM A LITTLE
AGITATED, OK?

10:26.750 --> 10:27.959
LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE WORD OF ADVICE

10:27.959 --> 10:30.417
ABOUT GIRLS, MY FRIEND.
THEY LIKE TO BE CALLED.

10:30.417 --> 10:31.625
EVEN WHEN THEY SAID THEY
DON'T WANNA BE CALLED,

10:31.625 --> 10:32.625
THEY WANNA BE CALLED,

10:32.625 --> 10:35.792
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THERE'S SEX INVOLVED.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.375
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAD SEX WITH AUDREY?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.959
YES, YES, I DID.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.291
AND YOU DIDN'T CALL HER?

10:40.291 --> 10:44.667
NO, I DIDN'T CALL HER.
OK? I DIDN'T CALL HER.

10:44.667 --> 10:45.667
[SIGHS]

10:45.667 --> 10:47.000
NOW THAT
JOEY'S BEEN MUGGED,

10:47.000 --> 10:48.458
AUDREY HAS SOMEHOW
GOTTEN IT INTO HER HEAD

10:48.458 --> 10:50.250
THAT IT'S OUR FAULT.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.542
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:51.542 --> 10:53.166
I MEAN, JOEY GETTING MUGGED
HAS NOTHING TO DO

10:53.166 --> 10:54.375
WITH YOU AND AUDREY
HAVING SEX.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.750
FINALLY, SOMEONE
WHO AGREES WITH ME,

10:56.750 --> 10:58.208
SO LOOK, COULD YOU
JUST GO UP THERE

10:58.208 --> 11:00.125
AND SEND HER DOWN,
PLEASE?

11:00.125 --> 11:01.750
NO.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.708
THEY'RE GONE.
THEY'RE GONE.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.750
UH, THEY PIMPED
OUT OF HERE AGES AGO.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.375
SORRY.

11:09.834 --> 11:10.375
WELL, GREAT.

11:10.375 --> 11:14.834
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.583
OBVIOUSLY,

11:16.583 --> 11:17.625
THIS NIGHT HAS NOT
GONE QUITE THE WAY

11:17.625 --> 11:20.208
THAT I HAD
ENVISIONED IT,

11:20.208 --> 11:21.667
BUT THE IMPORTANT PART
HERE, JACK,

11:21.667 --> 11:22.291
IS THAT I STILL
HAVE MY DIGNITY.

11:22.291 --> 11:25.125
MMPH.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.834
SO...

11:29.834 --> 11:30.959
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' TONIGHT?

11:30.959 --> 11:32.834
ACTUALLY, I KNOW THIS BAR
THAT DOES NOT CARD.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.917
SOLD.
YEAH, PACE,
I GOTTA TELL YA--

11:35.917 --> 11:37.750
TELL ME ON THE WAY.

11:37.750 --> 11:38.708
OK.

11:38.708 --> 11:39.959
DO YOU REALIZE WHERE
WE ARE RIGHT NOW?

11:39.959 --> 11:41.500
WE ARE BACKSTAGE
AT A ROCK CONCERT.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.417
HOW COOL IS THAT?

11:43.417 --> 11:44.708
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE LOST BACKSTAGE

11:44.708 --> 11:45.625
AT A ROCK CONCERT,

11:45.625 --> 11:46.667
WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS COOL.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.750
I THOUGHT THAT
THE GUY SAID 3 LEFTS.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.208
3 LEFTS WOULD BE
A CIRCLE, AUDREY.

11:52.208 --> 11:53.875
NO. 4 LEFTS IS A CIRCLE.
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.750
WE'RE BACKSTAGE
AT A ROCK CONCERT.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.542
LET'S GO THIS WAY.

11:58.542 --> 11:59.708
ALL RIGHT,
BEFORE WE GET THERE,

11:59.708 --> 12:01.083
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
TO LET ME HAVE THE CUTE ONE.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.375
YOU SAID THAT
THEY WERE ALL CUTE.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.125
WELL, YEAH, ONSTAGE.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.875
EVERYBODY'S CUTE
ONSTAGE, YOU KNOW?

12:05.875 --> 12:06.625
I MEAN, LIKE,
THE WHOLE BUZZ,

12:06.625 --> 12:09.417
THE MUSIC, INSTRUMENTS.

12:09.417 --> 12:10.667
THEIR MUSIC WAS AWFUL.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.041
IT WAS PUERILE
AND--AND GIMMICKY.

12:12.041 --> 12:14.583
OK, JUST LET ME HAVE
THE LEAD SINGER, ALL RIGHT?

12:14.583 --> 12:17.041
OK, FINE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:17.041 --> 12:18.917
UH, JUST TO SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT,

12:18.917 --> 12:21.125
YOU MAY BE HERE
ON SOME MISGUIDED,

12:21.125 --> 12:22.041
HORMONALLY CHARGED
ATTEMPT

12:22.041 --> 12:24.166
TO GET THE PACEY
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM--

12:24.166 --> 12:24.792
WHICH YOU PROMISED
NOT TO COMMENT ON.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.458
AND I'M NOT GOING TO--

12:26.458 --> 12:27.542
BUT I,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

12:27.542 --> 12:29.417
AM HERE OUT OF PURELY
PROFESSIONAL REASONS.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.500
I'M GOING
TO MEET THIS BAND.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.250
I'M GOING TO TAKE THEM BACK
TO THE RADIO STATION,

12:33.250 --> 12:34.750
INTERVIEW THEM, AND
THEN I GO HOME TO DAWSON.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.000
WHO'S OUT RIGHT NOW
WITH JOEY.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.667
WHICH DOESN'T
BOTHER ME A BIT.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.417
BECAUSE I,
UNLIKE YOU,

12:42.417 --> 12:44.583
AM TOTALLY CAPABLE
OF HAVING A MATURE,

12:44.583 --> 12:47.208
COMMITTED, TRUSTING,
ADULT RELATIONSHIP,

12:47.208 --> 12:48.375
AND I WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT

12:48.375 --> 12:51.458
IF YOU COULD JUST SHOW
A MODICUM OF PROFES--

12:53.125 --> 12:54.625
HEY.
HI.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.250
HEY, WYNN, DID WE ORDER

13:07.792 --> 13:10.542

13:10.542 --> 13:12.041
Wynn: SO WHAT'D
YOU THINK?

13:13.542 --> 13:16.041
IT WAS A GREAT SET.

13:16.041 --> 13:16.500
YOU DID--IT WAS...

13:16.500 --> 13:17.375
REALLY GOOD.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.375

13:20.375 --> 13:21.333
WE'LL GO GET OUR COATS.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.500
OK.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.583

WITH THE BEARD.

SO I TAKE IT

TO LIKE IT HERE?

13:29.959 --> 13:31.000
YEAH. I AM.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.250
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T
THINK I'D FIT IN, BUT--

13:33.250 --> 13:35.125
AND NOW YOU'RE
JUST AS PRETENTIOUS
AS THE REST OF THEM.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.125

HE'S VERY FUNNY.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.208
HOW COULD YOU
NOT LOVE A MOVIE

ON THE PASSPORT

13:39.000 --> 13:39.917

FAMOUS CINEMATOGRAPHER.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.959
YOU USED
TO KNOW THIS STUFF.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.667
WRONG. I ONLY PRETENDED
TO KNOW STUFF LIKE THIS

13:49.667 --> 13:50.875
SO THAT YOU WOULD BE
IMPRESSED WITH ME.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.667

WAY MORE OF A GIRL

13:52.667 --> 13:54.875

14:10.417 --> 14:12.750
SHOULD WE GO SAY HELLO?

14:14.625 --> 14:15.792
LET'S NOT.

14:15.792 --> 14:23.333
AH, GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.834
OK.

ABOUT CHASIN'?

14:41.417 --> 14:43.208
WELL, WHEN YOU WEIGH
A LITTLE PERSONAL PRIDE

14:43.208 --> 14:45.458
AGAINST THE OPPORTUNITY
FOR GREAT SEX, IT'S--

14:45.458 --> 14:46.000

14:46.000 --> 14:47.708
YES, EVERY TIME,

14:47.708 --> 14:49.208
AND WOMEN DO
LIKE TO BE CHASED.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.750
RIGHT UP TO THE POINT
WHERE THEY FILE FOR
THAT RESTRAINING ORDER.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.542
RIGHT. YOU GOT
A GOOD POINT THERE.

OF YOUR FRAT BROTHERS

15:06.834 --> 15:08.625

ON THEIR SKULLS.

15:08.625 --> 15:10.000
DRINK UP, WILL YOU?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN HERE.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.667
THIS ISN'T
THE KIND OF PLACE.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.125

A LOT OF WOMEN HERE.

OK, WHY DON'T WE JUST
KEEP THE PERSONAL STUFF
OUT OF THIS,

16:21.583 --> 16:23.083

STICK TO MUSIC.

WRONG WITH YOUR LIFE.

25:59.750 --> 26:02.417
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH MY LIFE?

26:02.417 --> 26:03.875
I--I DON'T KNOW.

26:03.875 --> 26:05.542
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW YOU THAT WELL.

26:06.625 --> 26:09.542
FOR EXAMPLE,
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

26:10.375 --> 26:13.917
YOU ALREADY
ASKED ME THAT.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.542
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER.

26:16.333 --> 26:19.417
WELL, WHY DO YOU
KEEP ASKING?

26:19.417 --> 26:21.291
BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED.

26:21.291 --> 26:24.750
[SIGHS]
IN WHAT?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.750
IN YOU.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.291
OH, GOSH, NO...

26:31.291 --> 26:33.875
I DO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

26:33.875 --> 26:34.917
YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.

26:34.917 --> 26:36.208
JUST NOW.
YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.417
NO. NO, REALLY.
UM...

26:37.417 --> 26:38.583
I DO HAVE
A BOYFRIEND,

26:38.583 --> 26:43.375
AND HE'S
A REALLY NICE GUY.

26:43.375 --> 26:46.250
AND I...

26:46.250 --> 26:48.083
WOULDN'T
IN A HUNDRED
MILLION YEARS,

26:48.083 --> 26:49.583
DO ANYTHING
TO HURT HIM.

26:49.583 --> 26:50.583
SO...

26:50.583 --> 26:50.959
I GOT IT.

26:50.959 --> 26:53.542
OK.

26:53.542 --> 26:55.625
GOOD.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.250
THE CARBONARA'S
NOT A CREAM SAUCE?

26:57.250 --> 26:59.291
NO. IT'S RAW EGG
YOLK, ACTUALLY.

26:59.291 --> 27:00.250
SO WHILE IT
COULD KILL YOU,

27:00.250 --> 27:01.208
WHO WANTS
TO LIVE IN A WORLD

27:01.208 --> 27:02.208
WHERE FOOD ISN'T
AN ADVENTURE, RIGHT?

27:02.208 --> 27:03.959
[LAUGHS]

27:03.959 --> 27:04.417
NOW.

27:04.417 --> 27:06.625
RIGHT, UM...

27:06.625 --> 27:09.125
JEFF, THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA TELL YA.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.125
I'M NOT, UH...

27:11.959 --> 27:16.708
THE THING IS,
I'M NOT TOTALLY...

27:16.708 --> 27:18.250
TOTALLY, UH...

27:18.250 --> 27:19.959
AVAILABLE?

27:19.959 --> 27:21.834
YOU'RE NOT AVAILABLE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY.

27:21.834 --> 27:23.291
YES. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.250
I SORT OF SUSPECTED.

27:25.250 --> 27:28.750
YOU SEEM VERY...

27:28.750 --> 27:29.750
TOGETHER.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.291
AND WE ARE.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.000
WELL, IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU BOTH.

27:34.041 --> 27:34.959
YOU KNOW,

27:34.959 --> 27:36.834
I DON'T USUALLY DO THIS,

27:36.834 --> 27:38.708
BUT WHAT THE HELL.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.417
[SIGHS]

27:40.417 --> 27:42.583
IF YOU GUYS EVER BREAK UP,

27:42.583 --> 27:44.750
GIVE ME A CALL SOMETIME.

27:51.792 --> 27:54.625
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
RIGHT THERE?

27:55.583 --> 27:56.708
I THINK THAT
I SHOULD BE INSULTED

27:56.708 --> 27:59.500
ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT
LEVELS ABOUT THAT.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.708
[CHUCKLES]
PACEY, YOU'RE NOT GAY.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.667
WELL, I  KNOW THAT
AND YOU  KNOW THAT,

28:02.667 --> 28:04.583
BUT HE  DOESN'T
KNOW THAT.

28:04.583 --> 28:05.667
SO FAR AS HE'S
CONCERNED,

28:05.667 --> 28:07.041
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.

28:07.041 --> 28:09.083
Humphrey Bogart: I KNOW.
IT'S JUST ANOTHER PICTURE.

28:09.083 --> 28:11.125
Man: ARE YOU IN ANY
POSITION TO BE CHOOSY?

28:11.125 --> 28:12.375
YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN A HIT
SINCE BEFORE THE WAR.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.333
AND YOUR LAST PICTURE--

28:14.333 --> 28:15.542
Bogart: SO IT STUNK.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.500
EVERYBODY MAKES FLOPS
EXCEPT YOU.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.291
YOU HAVEN'T HAD ONE
BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE
AND RE-MADE

28:19.291 --> 28:20.417
THE SAME PICTURE
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.

28:20.417 --> 28:22.667
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?
YOU'RE A POPCORN SALESMAN.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.041
Man: THAT'S RIGHT.
SO ARE YOU.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.291
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US IS THAT
I DON'T FIGHT IT.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.166
Bogart: ONE DAY
I'LL SURPRISE YOU

28:29.166 --> 28:30.208
AND WRITE SOMETHING GOOD.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.333
Man: ALTHEA BRUCE
WILL DO IT.

28:31.333 --> 28:32.375
Bogart: ALTHEA BRUCE--

28:32.375 --> 28:33.959
Man: ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS FOLLOW THE BOOK...

28:33.959 --> 28:35.792
EXCUSE ME.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.333
Second Man: HIYA, KIDDIES.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.375
WHAT A PICTURE I MADE.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.959
JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE PREVIEW.

28:41.959 --> 28:43.792
PASADENA'S OUT OF ITS MIND...

29:01.708 --> 29:03.375
GREAT TITLE.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.500
I THINK I MIGHT
STEAL IT FOR SOMETHING.

29:05.500 --> 29:09.166
HOW'D YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?

29:09.166 --> 29:10.917
SAW YOU WHEN
YOU CAME IN.

29:10.917 --> 29:11.458
SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.333
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

29:13.333 --> 29:14.291
[EXHALES]
LIKE MEDEA.

29:15.542 --> 29:17.583
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

29:17.583 --> 29:18.834
MINE'S NOT.
NOT WHAT?

29:18.834 --> 29:22.083
A FRIEND.
I MEAN, SHE IS, BUT,

29:22.083 --> 29:23.333
SOMETIMES WE GO OUT,

29:23.333 --> 29:24.333
AND WE HAVE
A FEW DRINKS,

29:24.333 --> 29:25.291
WE GO BACK TO MY PLACE.

29:25.291 --> 29:26.583
SHE FORGETS WHY
I'M NOT RIGHT FOR HER.

29:26.583 --> 29:27.417
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

29:27.417 --> 29:28.583
I'M TRYING
TO GET YOU TO HATE ME.

29:28.583 --> 29:30.667
WELL, IT'S WORKING.

29:32.583 --> 29:36.333
SO WHAT IS THE BEST ENDING
IN ALL OF LITERATURE?

29:36.333 --> 29:37.917
DON'T SAY ULYSSES.
EVERYONE SAYS ULYSSES.

29:39.708 --> 29:40.834
THAT'S EASY.

29:40.834 --> 29:43.333
SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION
BY FLAUBERT.

29:43.333 --> 29:43.875
AND WHAT HAPPENS?

29:43.875 --> 29:45.583
NOTHING, REALLY.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.250
JUST 2 OLD FRIENDS
SITTING AROUND

29:47.250 --> 29:49.417
REMEMBERING
THE BEST THING THAT
NEVER HAPPENED TO THEM.

29:49.417 --> 29:52.708
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING
THAT NEVER HAPPENED?

29:54.208 --> 29:55.166
FONDLY.

29:56.542 --> 29:57.792
YOU SEE,
FLAUBERT BELIEVED

29:57.792 --> 29:59.625
THAT ANTICIPATION
WAS THE PUREST FORM
OF PLEASURE...

29:59.625 --> 30:02.125
AND THE MOST RELIABLE.

30:02.125 --> 30:05.500
AND THAT WHILE
THE THINGS THAT
ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO YOU

30:05.500 --> 30:06.458
WOULD INVARIABLE
DISAPPOINT,

30:06.458 --> 30:07.417
THE THINGS THAT
NEVER HAPPENED TO YOU

30:07.417 --> 30:11.083
WOULD NEVER DIM.

30:11.083 --> 30:12.792
NEVER FADE.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.625
THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE
ENGRAVED IN YOUR HEART

30:14.625 --> 30:17.875
WITH A SORT OF
SWEET SADNESS.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.750
THAT SOUNDS...

30:21.291 --> 30:22.750
DEEP?

30:24.500 --> 30:25.917
COWARDLY.

30:27.708 --> 30:28.750
[SIGHS]

30:28.750 --> 30:31.875
WELL, UH, US ACADEMICS

30:31.875 --> 30:33.083
AREN'T
GENERALLY KNOWN FOR--

30:43.083 --> 30:44.041
COURAGE.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.834
WOW.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.500
GOD IS REALLY
PUNISHING ME HERE.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.917
FOR WHAT?

30:51.917 --> 30:53.166
I DON'T KNOW.

30:53.166 --> 30:57.250
I MUST HAVE DONE
SOMETHING TO A GIRL
WHEN I WAS 18.

30:57.250 --> 31:01.166
YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO TEMPT ME INTO
RECONSIDERING, ARE YOU?

31:02.917 --> 31:05.875
NO.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.708
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER
VERY WELL, DO WE?

31:08.708 --> 31:10.750
NO, WE DON'T.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.750
YOU HAVE THIS IMAGE OF ME,

31:12.750 --> 31:15.834
THIS NOT-ENTIRELY-TRUE
IMAGE OF ME.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.834
AS A 19th-CENTURY
HEROINE?

31:17.834 --> 31:19.333
YEAH.

31:20.208 --> 31:22.708
AND EVEN THOUGH
THAT'S NOT TRUE,

31:22.708 --> 31:26.667
I'D RATHER YOU GO ON
THINKING THAT IT IS.

31:29.458 --> 31:31.000
I THINK THAT
CAN BE ARRANGED.

31:33.875 --> 31:36.875
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK.

31:38.667 --> 31:39.041
ARE WE OK HERE?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.917
WE'RE FINE.

31:47.708 --> 31:50.333
IN 5 YEARS...

31:50.333 --> 31:51.834
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW
EVERYTHING I KNOW

31:51.834 --> 31:53.083
AND MORE.

31:53.083 --> 31:56.875
AND I WILL SEEM
LIKE THE BIGGEST DORK
YOU EVER MET.

31:59.458 --> 32:02.708
OR MAYBE I ALREADY DO.

32:22.917 --> 32:25.041
HEY.

32:26.291 --> 32:27.917
HEY.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.417
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO COME BACK INSIDE.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.792
DON'T BOTHER.

32:32.792 --> 32:33.667
WOULD YOU CARE
TO ELABORATE

32:33.667 --> 32:34.750
ON WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING EARLIER?

32:34.750 --> 32:36.959
[SIGHS]

32:36.959 --> 32:37.792
YOU'LL MISS THE REST
OF YOUR MOVIE.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.834
[LAUGHS]
I HAVE A FEELING

32:39.834 --> 32:41.208
THIS MIGHT BE
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.

32:46.291 --> 32:49.166
Joey: DID YOU EVER MEET
SOMEONE WHO SAW YOU...

32:49.166 --> 32:51.291
I MEAN, REALLY SAW YOU...

32:51.291 --> 32:54.125
BUT SOMEHOW,
ONLY SAW THE BEST?

32:54.125 --> 32:55.000
Dawson:
YOU MEAN BESIDES YOU?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.166
NOT THAT. I MEAN,
SOMEONE OLDER.

32:57.166 --> 33:01.125
SOMEONE WHO SAW
EVERYTHING YOU COULD BE.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.625
IF ONLY...

33:03.625 --> 33:04.667
IF ONLY WHAT?

33:04.667 --> 33:08.083
IF ONLY YOU WEREN'T YOU.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.041
[CHUCKLES]

33:09.041 --> 33:10.792
WELL, AFTER TONIGHT,

33:10.792 --> 33:12.250
I KINDA THINK
YOU MIGHT NOT BE.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.834
YOU KISSED
YOUR PROFESSOR.

33:15.834 --> 33:16.959
[LAUGHS]

33:16.959 --> 33:18.834
YOU KISSED THE GUY
WHO GIVES YOU GRADES.

33:18.834 --> 33:19.917
IS THIS CONSTRUCTIVE?

33:19.917 --> 33:21.959
SORRY.

33:21.959 --> 33:25.166
SO THE WORST PART IS,
IS THAT

33:25.166 --> 33:26.625
THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU
CALLED FROM THE MOVIE SET...

33:26.625 --> 33:28.750
YEAH?

33:28.750 --> 33:30.959
I WAS THERE
AT HIS HOUSE. ALONE.

33:30.959 --> 33:34.000
AND I WENT THERE
SAYING TO MYSELF

33:34.000 --> 33:35.959
THAT I WAS JUST GOING
TO STRAIGHTEN EVERYTHING OUT.

33:35.959 --> 33:36.875
MM-HMM.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.125
BUT REALLY, YOU WERE
GOING OVER THERE

33:38.125 --> 33:39.667
TO MAKE THINGS
MORE COMPLICATED.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.959
I DON'T THINK
THE ANSWER TO THAT

33:41.959 --> 33:43.250
WOULD SOUND VERY JOEY-LIKE.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.333
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO COME UP

33:44.333 --> 33:46.542
WITH A NEW DEFINITION
FOR THE TERM JOEY-LIKE.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.500
ANYWAY, SO YOU CALLED,

33:49.500 --> 33:52.208
I LEFT, AND I OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T GO BACK,

33:52.208 --> 33:53.417
WHICH IS PROBABLY
A GOOD THING, BECAUSE...

33:53.417 --> 33:58.333
I WOULD HAVE MADE
A GIGANTIC FOOL OF MYSELF.

33:59.792 --> 34:00.875
DON'T SAY THAT.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.375
YOU TOOK A RISK.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.917
YOU LIVED.
YOU EXPERIENCED
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

34:04.917 --> 34:06.792
I GUESS.
BUT NOW I'LL NEVER KNOW.

34:06.792 --> 34:09.291
NEVER KNOW WHAT?

34:10.333 --> 34:11.000
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE...

34:11.000 --> 34:13.833
AT THAT MOMENT OF TRUTH.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.375
YOU KNOW, WOULD I HAVE
CHICKENED OUT,

34:15.375 --> 34:19.125
WOULD I HAVE
GONE THROUGH WITH IT?

34:19.125 --> 34:20.958
THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW
WOULD BE TO--

34:20.958 --> 34:22.792
STOP TIME. GO BACKWARDS.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.250
YEAH.

34:24.250 --> 34:26.583
WOULD YOU WANNA DO THAT
IF YOU COULD?

34:29.208 --> 34:30.875
NO.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.708
AND I KNOW THAT
SOUNDS STRANGE.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.708
EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON, RIGHT?

34:33.708 --> 34:38.458
IT'S NOT SO BAD, REALLY.
THE NOT KNOWING.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.875
IT HAS THIS...

34:40.875 --> 34:42.875
SWEET SADNESS TO IT.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.250
HMM. I THINK
I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THAT FEELING.

34:58.708 --> 35:00.625
[SIGHS]

35:00.625 --> 35:02.041
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA
ADMIT, JACK,

35:02.041 --> 35:03.041
I NEVER REALLY
PEGGED YOU

35:03.041 --> 35:03.917
AS THE TYPE OF GUY
WHO WOULD

35:03.917 --> 35:05.083
COME INTO A PLACE
LIKE THIS ALONE.

35:05.083 --> 35:07.875
I'M NOT ALONE.
[CLEARS THROAT]

35:07.875 --> 35:09.291
HEH. THAT'S
A GOOD POINT.

35:12.959 --> 35:15.708
ACTUALLY, AUDREY
BROUGHT ME HERE

35:15.708 --> 35:16.208
THE NIGHT YOU COOKED US
ALL DINNER.

35:19.166 --> 35:20.583
YOU KNOW, THAT'S...

35:20.583 --> 35:22.000
THAT'S KIND OF THE ESSENCE
OF AUDREY, ISN'T IT?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.208
I MEAN, SHE JUST ZEROS IN

35:25.208 --> 35:27.083
ON THE ONE THING
THAT YOU'RE
SLIGHTLY AFRAID OF,

35:27.083 --> 35:29.834
AND THEN SHE JUST DOES NOT
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

35:29.834 --> 35:31.625
THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY
TO HAVE IN A PERSON.

35:31.625 --> 35:32.917
YES, IT IS.

35:32.917 --> 35:34.125
YEAH.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.417
I WONDER WHO DOES
THAT FOR HER?

35:39.792 --> 35:42.458
[LAUGHS]

35:42.458 --> 35:45.792
OK, UH, I THINK
I'M GONNA GO, UH...

35:45.792 --> 35:47.166
CHASE THE GIRLS.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.583
YES, AND CHASE
THE GIRLS.

35:48.583 --> 35:49.583
ARE YOU GONNA
COME OR WHAT?

35:49.583 --> 35:50.625
NO, I THINK
I'M GONNA HANG.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.750
OK, COOL. I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND, MAN.
OK.

35:58.500 --> 35:58.917
TAKE CARE, AUDREY.

35:58.917 --> 36:02.291
OH, MAN.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.583
IT'S BEEN
THOROUGHLY, UH...

36:04.583 --> 36:06.417
SLANTED AND ENCHANTED.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.708
WELL, THANK YOU,
I THINK,

36:08.708 --> 36:11.708
AND, UM...

36:11.708 --> 36:12.333
THANKS
FOR THE ADVICE.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.834
NO PROBLEM.
OK.

36:14.834 --> 36:15.333
ARE YOU COMIN', STEVE?

36:15.333 --> 36:17.083
YEAH, IN A SEC.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.000
BYE.
SEE YA.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.333
SO, YOUR--
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

36:21.333 --> 36:24.708
I MEAN, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

36:24.708 --> 36:26.834
I MEAN, A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
LIKE YOU.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.375
SEE, WE WERE--
WE WERE FRIENDS FIRST.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.875
FRIENDS?
YEAH.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.208
SO NO PASSION?

36:33.583 --> 36:34.750
DID I SAY THAT?

36:34.750 --> 36:38.000
NO, BUT YOU DID SAY
THAT YOU DON'T TRUST PASSION.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
YEAH, BUT JUST BECAUSE
2 PEOPLE ARE FRIENDS FIRST

36:42.000 --> 36:44.458
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY
DON'T HAVE ANY PASSION
IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

36:44.458 --> 36:46.208
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T---

36:46.208 --> 36:48.250
I DON'T MEAN TO INSULT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.166
I MEAN, IT'S JUST...

36:50.166 --> 36:51.291
I BELIEVE
IN THE CONNECTION.

36:51.291 --> 36:53.375
YOU KNOW,
THAT GUT REACTION

36:53.375 --> 36:57.625
THAT SAYS "THIS PERSON,
THIS STRANGER...

36:57.625 --> 37:01.834
IS MEANT TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE,"
AND I DON'T KNOW.

37:01.834 --> 37:03.875
I--I GUESS I JUST FELT
THAT FOR YOU TONIGHT.

37:03.875 --> 37:07.041
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
A REALLY EASY THING

37:07.041 --> 37:09.417
FOR YOU TO SAY,
ISN'T IT?

37:09.417 --> 37:10.917
SOME
ROCK AND ROLL GUY

37:10.917 --> 37:14.917
WHO JUST COMES INTO
TOWN FOR 24 HOURS
AND THEN LEAVES?

37:17.041 --> 37:20.458
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

37:22.417 --> 37:23.375
[SIGHS]

37:28.333 --> 37:30.708
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHIN'
TO REMEMBER US BY.

37:30.708 --> 37:32.667
[CHUCKLES]
THANKS.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.083
DON'T MENTION IT.

37:36.750 --> 37:37.750
BYE.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.083
BYE.

37:41.542 --> 37:46.458
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS SO
NOT THE NIGHT I EXPECTED.

37:46.458 --> 37:47.834
YEAH, I KNOW.
SORRY I TOOK
THE SINGLE ONE.

37:47.834 --> 37:50.041
NAH, IT HAPPENS.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.333
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S GOD'S
WAY OF TELLING ME

37:51.333 --> 37:53.375
I'M NOT AS SINGLE
AS I THOUGHT I WAS.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.333
MMM...

37:54.333 --> 37:56.000
OR MAYBE THAT IS.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.667
AAH!

37:57.667 --> 38:00.583
GO. GO ON.
MAKE HIM HAPPY.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.917
WHY WOULD I WANNA
DO A THING LIKE THAT?

38:02.917 --> 38:05.125
Jen: OK, FINE.
GO MAKE HIM
MISERABLE.

38:05.125 --> 38:07.250
I DON'T CARE.
JUST GO TO HIM.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.375
OK.

38:09.375 --> 38:10.834
BYE.
BYE, SWEETIE.

38:25.417 --> 38:26.417
SHE NEED A RIDE?

38:26.417 --> 38:29.625
SHE'S, UM, GOT A CAR.

38:29.625 --> 38:30.708
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

38:30.708 --> 38:33.291
[SIGHS]
I NEED A LIFE.

38:33.291 --> 38:35.417
YEAH, YOU DO, DON'T YA?

38:37.291 --> 38:39.959
LOOK, PACEY...

38:39.959 --> 38:43.500
I THINK I NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.
TO ME?

38:44.458 --> 38:47.834
I KINDA MAYBE
OVERREACTED A LITTLE.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.041
YOU DON'T SAY?

38:50.041 --> 38:51.792
I CAN'T HELP IT, OK?

38:51.792 --> 38:53.458
HAPPINESS,
IT FREAKS ME OUT.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.792
IT'S LIKE
ALL THOSE PERFECTLY
MANICURED LAWNS

38:55.792 --> 38:58.166
AT THE BEGINNING
OF BLUE VELVET,
YOU KNOW?

38:58.166 --> 38:59.500
YOU JUST KNOW
SOMETHING EVIL
LURKS BENEATH.

39:02.417 --> 39:04.834
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE REAL PROBLEM IS HERE,
DON'T YOU, AUDREY?

39:04.834 --> 39:06.417
NO, PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.

39:06.417 --> 39:08.417
YOU ARE MUCH MORE AFRAID
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME
THE SECOND TIME

39:08.417 --> 39:09.708
THAN YOU WERE
THE FIRST.

39:09.708 --> 39:12.708
YOU SEE, I'VE HAD A VERY
EDUCATIONAL NIGHT TONIGHT

39:12.708 --> 39:13.708
AT MY FAVORITE GAY BAR,

39:13.708 --> 39:14.917
AND WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH

39:14.917 --> 39:17.166
IS I'M JUST SIMPLY NOT GONNA
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

39:17.166 --> 39:18.583
WELL, THAT'S NOT
VERY PC OF YOU.

39:18.583 --> 39:22.291
NO, IT'S NOT, AND THIS
PROBABLY ISN'T, EITHER.

39:24.333 --> 39:24.500
MMM.

39:31.542 --> 39:34.166
SO WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND, ANYWAY?

39:34.166 --> 39:36.417
I MET THIS REALLY
HOT GUY IN THE BAND.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.875
WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS HOT GUY WAS...

39:38.875 --> 39:40.834
MMM.

39:50.542 --> 39:52.417
I BROUGHT YOU A T-SHIRT.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.542
COOL.

39:55.542 --> 39:56.792
[LAUGHS]

39:56.792 --> 39:58.834
WOULD I BRING YOU
ANYTHING LESS?

40:00.375 --> 40:02.708
[CHUCKLES]
[SIGHS]

40:02.708 --> 40:04.458
MMM.

40:07.375 --> 40:10.250
SO HOW'S JOEY?

40:10.250 --> 40:11.708
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
SHE ALMOST HAD AN AFFAIR

40:11.708 --> 40:14.125
WITH HER
ENGLISH PROFESSOR?

40:14.125 --> 40:15.125
JOEY?

40:15.125 --> 40:16.166
MM-HMM.

40:16.166 --> 40:17.542
JOEY POTTER?

40:17.542 --> 40:19.458
YEAH.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.417
WOW.

40:20.417 --> 40:21.417
IT WAS BIZARRE,
ACTUALLY.

40:21.417 --> 40:24.083
IT WAS, LIKE,
ALMOST LIKE MEETING

40:24.083 --> 40:26.083
A NEW PERSON
OR SOMETHING.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.708
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

40:28.708 --> 40:30.625
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

40:30.625 --> 40:31.750
WELL, LIKE, TALKING
TO HER TONIGHT,

40:31.750 --> 40:35.625
I JUST REALIZED
HOW MUCH TIME
HAS PASSED...

40:35.625 --> 40:37.750
HOW MUCH
WE'VE ALL CHANGED.

40:37.750 --> 40:40.792
AND IT'S SO BAD?

40:40.792 --> 40:43.083
NOT NECESSARILY.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.500
[SIGHS]

40:45.500 --> 40:46.583
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

40:46.583 --> 40:47.542
WHAT?

40:49.458 --> 40:52.542
DO YOU THINK
THAT WHEN, UH,

40:52.542 --> 40:54.542
WHEN 2 PEOPLE
ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP,

40:54.542 --> 40:57.083
THAT THEY SHOULD
BE PASSIONATE ABOUT
THE SAME THINGS

40:57.083 --> 40:58.792
IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK?

41:00.792 --> 41:04.667
NO. NOT AS LONG
AS THEY'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

41:07.625 --> 41:08.667
AND WE ARE.

41:08.667 --> 41:13.000
RIGHT? WE'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.208
YOU'RE NOT HAVING DOUBTS
ABOUT US, ARE YOU?

41:15.208 --> 41:20.625
NO. NO, I'M JUST TIRED.

41:20.625 --> 41:23.583
I DON'T KNOW. INSANE.

41:23.583 --> 41:23.792
[LAUGHS]
