11:11.171 --> 11:13.996
we should plan for surgery
to remove the clots as soon

11:14.007 --> 11:15.456
as possible.
Then he'll be able

11:15.533 --> 11:17.425
to breathe comfortably again.

11:21.497 --> 11:23.840
I knew he looked familiar.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.685
I butted heads with Cain
months ago over this guy.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.929
He reclassified his elective
spine surgery as urgent.

11:30.006 --> 11:32.181
Which means if Mullins got COVID
here at Chastain...

11:32.192 --> 11:34.100
He's another Cain casualty.

11:34.177 --> 11:35.601
And we both know that that
surgery wasn't truly emergent.

11:35.678 --> 11:38.029
Well, we suspect.
We don't know for sure.

11:38.106 --> 11:39.355
Okay, in Mina's kangaroo court,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.107
Barrett Cain is sentenced
to death.

11:41.184 --> 11:43.576
All right, I'm gonna
find out for sure.

11:46.281 --> 11:48.498
♪

11:56.883 --> 11:59.625
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

11:59.702 --> 12:01.461
You froze up before,
and then you took off

12:01.537 --> 12:03.671
like a bat out of hell.

12:03.748 --> 12:06.599
Yeah, I'm just fried.
It's jet lag.

12:09.212 --> 12:11.387
(sighs)

12:11.398 --> 12:13.014
Multiple small nodules

12:13.090 --> 12:15.391
with surrounding
ground glass opacities.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.235
It's consistent
with histoplasmosis.

12:17.312 --> 12:19.645
And a lot of other types
of infections

12:19.722 --> 12:21.906
-and inflammatory processes.
-Yeah.

12:21.983 --> 12:24.576
Histoplasmosis is one
of the great imitators.

12:24.652 --> 12:27.412
All of her test results
and symptoms

12:27.489 --> 12:29.864
could mimic something else.

12:29.941 --> 12:32.241
Her diagnosis
might not be straightforward.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.410
-And she might not have histo.
-True.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.920
But until we have something
more definitive,

12:35.997 --> 12:37.505
we stay the course.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.924
Have you heard anything

12:40.001 --> 12:42.710
about who might be
replacing Kim as our CEO?

12:42.787 --> 12:45.597
-Come in.
-Well, have you?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.383
Not a word.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.603
What are you doing?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.941
Who's he?

12:57.018 --> 13:00.269
My former stepson Jake.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.188
My first wife's kid.

13:02.265 --> 13:03.948
I was with Donna for six years.

13:04.025 --> 13:05.399
Gosh.

13:05.476 --> 13:08.236
We've been out of touch
for a long time, and

13:08.312 --> 13:11.364
I reached out
during the pandemic, and, um,

13:11.440 --> 13:13.950
you know, didn't...
didn't hear anything back, but,

13:13.960 --> 13:18.621
just, I'd like to try and...
to reconnect with him.

13:18.632 --> 13:22.124
I was with him
from when he was six

13:22.135 --> 13:23.417
till just about 12, and...

13:23.494 --> 13:25.461
Oh, God, we had fun.

13:25.496 --> 13:30.466
And he was angry and-and...
and hurt

13:30.477 --> 13:34.053
when I divorced his mother.

13:34.130 --> 13:37.816
Then Donna threatened to kill me
if I reached out to him.

13:37.892 --> 13:41.727
Said I'd done enough damage
by abandoning them, and...

13:41.804 --> 13:44.572
Oh, I shouldn't have
listened to her.

13:47.310 --> 13:50.152
Tread lightly.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.746
And good luck, Randolph.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.514
CONRAD:
Hey. Bianca.

14:09.591 --> 14:11.349
Not sure if you're aware
of this,

14:11.426 --> 14:15.520
but HR can help you find
affordable childcare, okay?

14:15.597 --> 14:19.190
Um, great. But my name's not
Bianca and I don't have kids.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.267
(alarm sounding)

14:21.344 --> 14:22.602
We need help!

14:22.678 --> 14:24.195
What happened?

14:24.272 --> 14:26.022
She fell.
And she's in a lot of pain

14:26.032 --> 14:27.315
and she's having even
more trouble breathing now.

14:27.391 --> 14:30.276
Please, you got to do something.

14:30.353 --> 14:32.203
-DEVON: We're gonna get you
on the bed.
-CONRAD: We got you.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.538
We got you.

14:33.615 --> 14:36.365
(wheezing)

14:36.376 --> 14:38.701
Nichelle, try to relax.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.329
Try and relax. Try and relax.

14:41.405 --> 14:43.756
(grunts, panting)

14:46.077 --> 14:48.761
-Bilateral crackles.
-Sats in the 80s.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.223
Something's not adding up.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.017
We'll run some more tests
and I'll order a chest CT.

14:58.547 --> 15:00.389
Well-well, could it be the meds?

15:00.400 --> 15:04.027
As I told Nichelle,
very unlikely.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.234
Shingles. I saw a dermatologist.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.861
They put you on an antiviral?

15:13.938 --> 15:15.496
-Yeah, ten days ago.
-Good.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.824
-She's gonna be okay, right?
-Yeah.

15:18.901 --> 15:21.911
If it's not a fungus,
we'll figure out what it is.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.339
She's stressed
about the special election.

15:25.282 --> 15:26.966
Mr. Randall
didn't want her to run.

15:27.743 --> 15:29.677
And that's why he's not here?

15:31.005 --> 15:33.839
Tom Randall cares
about Tom Randall.

15:33.916 --> 15:36.258
He puts in time for her
if there's a camera.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.595
Nichelle cares about everybody.
Atlanta needs her.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.731
Georgia needs her.

15:45.469 --> 15:48.029
You know, I couldn't imagine
what we'd do without her.

15:59.442 --> 16:01.292
Is he off his call yet?

16:01.369 --> 16:03.411
I'm sorry, Mr. Yorn
is on a different call now.

16:03.487 --> 16:06.247
Of course he is. When do you
suppose he might be available?

16:06.323 --> 16:09.458
-Check back in an hour.
-That's what you said
an hour ago.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.086
Tell you what,
why don't you have me paged

16:12.163 --> 16:14.263
-when he's off the phone?
-Certainly.

16:20.337 --> 16:21.980
(monitor beeping steadily)

16:22.056 --> 16:24.098
-Mr. Mullins.
-Hey.

16:24.175 --> 16:25.933
I have a couple of questions
I'd like to ask you

16:26.010 --> 16:28.152
-before we prep you for surgery.
-Yeah.

16:28.229 --> 16:32.148
Have you continued to experience
acute onset bowel incontinence

16:32.158 --> 16:34.400
post the discectomy
Dr. Cain performed

16:34.477 --> 16:36.327
back in April last year?

16:36.404 --> 16:38.496
Or was it only before surgery?

16:38.573 --> 16:40.281
Say what?

16:40.357 --> 16:42.199
Were you having difficulty
controlling your bowels

16:42.276 --> 16:46.245
after the operation
or was it only before?

16:46.363 --> 16:49.749
Neither. Um, I've never
had that problem.

16:49.825 --> 16:53.720
Did Dr. Cain check
your rectal tone back in April?

16:55.923 --> 16:59.508
Oh, uh, no.
Uh, I think I'd remember that.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.511
(chuckles):
Sure. Of course you would.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.014
All right. I'll see you
in the OR.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.516
And we'll get you back
on your feet before you know it.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.110
Okay.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.536
Ben Mullins. Remember him?

17:18.613 --> 17:20.446
He's back
with chronic thromboembolic

17:20.523 --> 17:23.449
-pulmonary hypertension.
-And you're telling me
this because...?

17:23.526 --> 17:25.376
Because the clots could be
the result of COVID.

17:25.453 --> 17:27.286
Which he most likely
contracted here

17:27.363 --> 17:29.213
after you conned him
into thinking

17:29.290 --> 17:31.999
-his discectomy was urgent.
-I did nothing of the kind.

17:32.076 --> 17:33.501
I know you fabricated
his symptoms

17:33.577 --> 17:35.002
to justify the surgery.

17:35.079 --> 17:36.387
Mullins was never incontinent.

17:36.464 --> 17:39.390
He doesn't even remember
you checking his rectal tone.

17:39.467 --> 17:42.176
I know I may look like I have
stupid written on my forehead,

17:42.253 --> 17:45.229
-but I see what's going on here.
-Even if I did what you are

17:45.306 --> 17:49.183
accusing me of, there are plenty
other white surgeons out there

17:49.260 --> 17:51.852
who did elective surgeries
during COVID.

17:51.887 --> 17:54.405
Why come after the only
other prominent Black cutter?

17:54.482 --> 17:56.240
There are plenty of brothers

17:56.317 --> 17:58.076
I left behind because they
weren't ready for the fight.

17:58.152 --> 18:02.863
Not once did it ever occur to me
to pick them off.

18:02.940 --> 18:05.199
But you're that one rising crab
in the barrel

18:05.276 --> 18:07.960
who pulls the one
above you right back in.

18:10.164 --> 18:13.332
No. You got me wrong, bro.

18:13.409 --> 18:14.917
That's not my M.O.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.585
I don't want you gone, Barrett.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.087
I happen to find strength

18:18.098 --> 18:20.172
in our all-too-small
brotherhood,

18:20.249 --> 18:22.258
but I'm about pushing
each other to excel,

18:22.268 --> 18:24.343
to be more prepared,
to be more skilled,

18:24.420 --> 18:26.220
so our talent
cannot be discounted.

18:26.297 --> 18:28.013
It doesn't matter
if we're better.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.056
We're always gonna
be discounted.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.016
It's about the money.

18:31.093 --> 18:33.444
Money's the one thing
they can't ignore.

18:33.521 --> 18:36.230
Which is why I'm gonna continue
to do whatever it takes

18:36.307 --> 18:38.241
to be the top earner.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.327
That's the way
the game is played.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.124
Playing the game doesn't mean
you have to lose your soul.

18:46.200 --> 18:51.704
You do you, and I'll do me.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.006
Let the cards fall
where they may.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.036
♪

19:29.669 --> 19:31.294
Devon.

19:34.490 --> 19:37.175
Thanks. What's up?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.586
Nichelle and James
seem concerned

19:40.663 --> 19:43.464
that she's taking
the antifungal meds.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.016
It's a little weird.

19:45.092 --> 19:48.352
When James asked me
if she was gonna be okay,

19:48.429 --> 19:51.480
he looked like I'd look
if I thought I might lose Nic.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.234
So you think there's something
going on between them.

20:08.691 --> 20:11.283
Hey, what's up?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.377
So, Cain lied on Mullins' file.

20:13.454 --> 20:15.871
Said he was incontinent
to justify the surgery,

20:15.882 --> 20:19.291
-but he was not.
-That's it.

20:19.368 --> 20:20.876
We have what we need
to get rid of him.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.553
When you say "get rid of him,"

20:22.630 --> 20:25.005
it means to potentially
destroy his career.

20:25.082 --> 20:27.508
-Absolutely.
-Yeah, I-I need to sit with it.

20:27.543 --> 20:30.353
I can't imagine why.
He's a proven menace.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.389
-It's complicated.
-No, it's not.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.350
It's simple. Cain is dangerous.

20:36.427 --> 20:37.559
He shouldn't be allowed
to practice surgery.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.395
We can make that happen.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.147
It is incumbent
upon us to do so.

20:42.224 --> 20:45.192
Like I said, I need a minute.

20:45.269 --> 20:46.494
All right?

20:47.730 --> 20:49.247
All right.

20:54.495 --> 20:57.079
(monitor beeping steadily)

20:57.090 --> 20:59.331
Nichelle, I'm gonna follow your
lead and speak truth to power.

20:59.408 --> 21:00.916
-Conrad...
-I don't think you're telling me

21:00.927 --> 21:02.543
everything I need to know.

21:02.619 --> 21:04.253
And I'm worried that
whatever you're holding back

21:04.264 --> 21:05.596
is putting you at risk.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.684
It's okay. You can tell me.

21:11.128 --> 21:13.229
I can't feel my legs.

21:18.635 --> 21:20.444
CONRAD:
Can you feel that?

21:20.521 --> 21:22.697
-You feel that?
-No.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.029
Lesions in L3-L4.

21:30.105 --> 21:32.123
That's the cause of the lower
extremity paralysis.

21:32.199 --> 21:35.075
Histo only causes spinal lesions
in the immunocompromised.

21:35.152 --> 21:36.127
Which the patient is not.

21:36.203 --> 21:38.287
We're dealing
with something else.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.581
My gut says infection, but our
work didn't turn up anything.

21:40.657 --> 21:42.249
I still think she's not
telling me something.

21:42.326 --> 21:44.043
And it may end up killing her.

21:44.119 --> 21:46.962
Well, I'll leave the detective
work to you two smarty-pants.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.466
Right now, our future governor
needs a spinal decompression

21:50.476 --> 21:52.351
so her paralysis
doesn't become permanent.

22:01.062 --> 22:02.320
Hey.

22:02.396 --> 22:03.979
-There you are.
-Hey.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.325
I have, uh, concerns
about this bypass thing.

22:07.401 --> 22:09.327
-Okay.
-So, you're telling me

22:09.403 --> 22:12.488
you're not just gonna run
my blood through the machine

22:12.498 --> 22:15.333
but you have to...
have to stop my heart, too?

22:15.409 --> 22:16.950
MINA:
Yes. The bypass

22:17.027 --> 22:18.243
will act as your heart and lungs

22:18.320 --> 22:19.578
-while we remove the clot.
-Okay. So,

22:19.655 --> 22:22.581
what happens
if my heart doesn't, um,

22:22.658 --> 22:24.008
start back up again?

22:24.085 --> 22:26.585
Oh, well,
in that very remote possibility,

22:26.662 --> 22:29.347
we would do everything we can
to get your heart beating again.

22:29.423 --> 22:32.007
-"Remote possibility."
-BEVERLY: Mm-hmm.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.300
That isn't reassuring, okay?

22:33.377 --> 22:35.302
I don't know if you've noticed,

22:35.379 --> 22:36.970
but, uh...

22:37.047 --> 22:38.472
(coughs)

22:38.549 --> 22:41.183
...but remote possibilities
tend to happen

22:41.194 --> 22:42.601
-to me.
-Hey.

22:42.678 --> 22:46.197
Forgive him.
It's just been a rough year.

22:46.273 --> 22:48.023
First it was
the emergency back surgery

22:48.034 --> 22:50.818
and then his COVID infection,
and now this.

22:50.894 --> 22:53.278
(slurring): I must be
the unluckiest man alive.

22:53.355 --> 22:55.531
-(alarm beeping)
-MINA: Mr. Mullins?
-Sweetheart?

22:55.541 --> 22:57.875
-(slurring)
-What's going on?
-He may be having a stroke.

22:57.952 --> 22:59.868
-Excuse me. I'll up his oxygen.
-Oh.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.547
(breathing heavily, grunting)

23:03.624 --> 23:06.041
All right, his pupils are
still reactive, but he's lost

23:06.052 --> 23:08.377
tone on his left side.
He needs a head CT.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.429
We need to page Cain.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.970
Hey.

23:18.046 --> 23:19.888
Holy crap.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.474
What are you doing
lurking out here?

23:22.551 --> 23:23.892
Well, I-I was actually
lurking inside.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.903
Just out of sight.

23:25.980 --> 23:28.313
I didn't want
to throw you off your game.

23:28.390 --> 23:31.575
The bouncer told me
you come back here between sets.

23:31.652 --> 23:34.319
(chuckles): Just thought I'd
come see what you were up to.

23:34.396 --> 23:37.248
Seriously? 20 years go by,

23:37.324 --> 23:39.417
and you just thought
you'd come see what I'm up to?

23:39.452 --> 23:41.326
What do...
what do you want, 'Dolph?

23:41.403 --> 23:43.587
So, how's-how's your mother?

23:43.664 --> 23:45.923
She's doing well.
She-- Over you, finally.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.583
Listen, I've got
a lot of friends inside,

23:47.593 --> 23:50.261
so if we could just get to it,
whatever it is?

23:50.337 --> 23:53.005
Yeah. Of-- Yeah. Of course.

23:53.081 --> 23:56.600
Uh, like a lot of people,

23:56.677 --> 23:59.052
the pandemic has forced me
to reevaluate things,

23:59.129 --> 24:02.014
and I realize I've...

24:02.090 --> 24:06.101
I put my professional
and financial life

24:06.112 --> 24:10.898
ahead of my relationships,
and I'm-I'm so sorry for that.

24:10.974 --> 24:14.985
I've seen a lot of people die
this year, Jake.

24:15.062 --> 24:18.614
Some alone.
Others surrounded by loved ones.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.407
Oh.

24:20.484 --> 24:23.368
You're here because
y-you're scared of dying alone.

24:23.445 --> 24:25.579
No.

24:25.656 --> 24:28.081
-That's not why I'm here.
-But it's totally on brand.

24:28.158 --> 24:29.467
Oh, that's not entirely fair.

24:29.543 --> 24:31.126
We had a lot
of wonderful times together.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.045
I-I-- And I-I blew it.

24:33.121 --> 24:35.723
There's no way
around that. I-I...

24:37.477 --> 24:39.593
I cared for you, and I blew it.

24:39.670 --> 24:42.137
No, if you cared for me,
you would've stayed in touch.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.556
Go find somebody else
to hold your hand while you die.

24:44.633 --> 24:46.317
I already mourned losing you.

24:58.405 --> 25:00.405
Ben Mullins has
a clotting disorder

25:00.482 --> 25:04.159
that is threatening his heart,
lungs and now his brain.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.410
This is your fault.

25:05.487 --> 25:06.954
I know the hierarchy
between you two is fluid,

25:07.030 --> 25:09.164
but I will not be spoken to
that way by a resident.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.499
AUSTIN:
Two things, bro,

25:10.510 --> 25:13.168
Dr. Okafor
is no ordinary resident,

25:13.179 --> 25:14.845
and she happens to be right.

25:14.922 --> 25:16.797
-This is on you.
-No, it's on the patient,

25:16.873 --> 25:19.016
who was advised of the risks.

25:19.093 --> 25:20.926
And last time I checked,
I didn't unleash a pandemic

25:21.003 --> 25:23.303
-on the world.
-Mm-hmm. Deny it all you want,

25:23.380 --> 25:25.347
but you will be held responsible
for this.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.690
Logan Kim isn't here
to protect you anymore.

25:26.767 --> 25:28.433
Hey.

25:28.510 --> 25:30.352
Let's just, uh,

25:30.363 --> 25:31.862
take a breath, all right?

25:37.060 --> 25:39.278
He had a stroke in his
nondominant frontal lobe.

25:39.354 --> 25:41.029
AUSTIN:
All right.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.156
Well, looks like we can
proceed with the surgery.

25:43.233 --> 25:45.492
The blood thinners he's on
should be adequate

25:45.569 --> 25:47.494
to treat the clot,
but we need you to be on standby

25:47.571 --> 25:50.038
in case there's
hemorrhagic transformation

25:50.049 --> 25:52.291
and the vessel bursts.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.176
Always here when you need me.

25:55.296 --> 25:57.680
You'd both do well
to remember that.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.519
(monitor beeping steadily)

26:14.740 --> 26:16.365
Dr. Voss?

26:19.579 --> 26:22.413
Kit, what's going on down there?

26:22.489 --> 26:24.373
KIT:
Better if I show you.

26:33.617 --> 26:35.584
Nichelle has something
on her skin

26:35.595 --> 26:37.169
that looks like shingles.

26:37.245 --> 26:39.254
You have shingles, too.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.466
-Why?
-I don't know. Coincidence?

26:42.542 --> 26:44.843
It's a symptom of something
you and Nichelle caught

26:44.920 --> 26:46.887
when you were
out of town together.

26:46.963 --> 26:49.097
-I'm guessing
nowhere near Kentucky.
-I'm her driver.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.108
-All right? That's all.
-Yeah, no, of course.

26:51.185 --> 26:54.528
That being said, she's gonna die
unless I get the truth.

26:56.690 --> 26:58.532
(exhales)

27:00.453 --> 27:02.778
We were in the Caribbean.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.739
Jamaica.

27:05.816 --> 27:08.116
Are the meds you're taking
for the shingles working?

27:08.127 --> 27:10.285
Not really. Why?

27:10.296 --> 27:12.504
Because I know what you both
have now, and it's not shingles.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.801
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:25.811 --> 27:28.062
(high-pitched whirring)

27:31.174 --> 27:33.100
-(heart beating)
-AUSTIN: All right.

27:33.176 --> 27:36.103
A massive clot removed
and a beating heart.

27:36.179 --> 27:38.530
I say it's a beautiful day
in the OR.

27:40.475 --> 27:41.992
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-CHU: Intracranial pressure

27:42.069 --> 27:43.202
is rising.

27:47.983 --> 27:50.158
-Pupils are blown.
-MINA: He's brain-hemorrhaging.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.993
AUSTIN:
And herniating.
He doesn't have much time.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.955
-Somebody call Cain.
-CAIN: He's already here.

27:55.031 --> 27:56.790
Elevate the head,

27:56.867 --> 27:58.759
reverse the blood thinners,
prep for a craniotomy.

28:12.266 --> 28:14.525
Incision.

28:21.683 --> 28:23.483
(monitor beeping rapidly)

28:23.560 --> 28:25.035
CHU:
Intracranial pressure
is up to 60.

28:25.112 --> 28:27.028
CAIN:
I know how high it is.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.664
Ready to enter the skull. Drill?

28:41.462 --> 28:43.595
(whirring)

29:04.410 --> 29:06.860
CHU:
Blood pressure's rising fast.

29:06.937 --> 29:08.245
AUSTIN:
What's going on
up there, Cain?

29:08.322 --> 29:09.529
I stopped the bleed,
but he's still herniating.

29:09.606 --> 29:10.989
-How is that possible?
-He's bleeding

29:11.066 --> 29:12.365
from a place where I can't see.

29:12.442 --> 29:13.909
Other side of the brain.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.368
-Ultrasound?
-AUSTIN: Aren't you supposed

29:15.445 --> 29:17.329
to drill a hole
in the other side of the skull?

29:17.405 --> 29:19.923
CAIN:
No, he doesn't have the time
for two craniotomies.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.091
I'm gonna pass the needle
from this side of the brain

29:21.168 --> 29:23.093
to the other
to remove the blood.

29:23.170 --> 29:25.045
MINA:
You can't blindly poke
a needle through the sides

29:25.121 --> 29:27.506
-of his brain. You'll kill him.
-I don't blindly operate,

29:27.582 --> 29:29.224
and nobody asked
for your permission.

29:31.086 --> 29:33.220
Yo, have you ever
done this before?

29:33.296 --> 29:34.605
Nope. Never.

29:37.467 --> 29:39.100
We need to stop this.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.153
If we do, the patient will die.

29:42.097 --> 29:43.438
Listen to your mentor, Okafor.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.532
Stay in your lane.

29:48.144 --> 29:50.120
CHU:
Blood pressure's dropping.

29:50.197 --> 29:51.205
CAIN:
Time to go to work.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.550
CHU:
BP stabilized.

30:11.626 --> 30:13.727
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:24.514 --> 30:26.740
(door opens)

30:29.161 --> 30:32.153
You're going to protect Cain.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.164
He's done so much harm.

30:34.241 --> 30:36.500
Yeah, but in his mind, he's just
doing whatever he can do

30:36.577 --> 30:39.452
to survive in a system
that's been rigged against us.

30:39.529 --> 30:44.007
So you think systemic racism
excuses his behavior?

30:44.084 --> 30:45.417
No.

30:45.493 --> 30:48.587
But it does explain it.

30:48.663 --> 30:52.299
The frustration,
the-the pain, the anger

30:52.375 --> 30:54.676
that builds up,
knowing that in this country,

30:54.687 --> 30:57.095
your life can go south
at any moment

30:57.172 --> 31:00.357
just because of the melanin
in your skin.

31:01.551 --> 31:03.643
Now, I was raised not
to let the unfairness

31:03.720 --> 31:06.363
of discrimination consume me.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.148
But if Cain wasn't taught that,

31:08.224 --> 31:10.525
can you blame him
for how he turned out?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.360
I mean, what else do you expect?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.529
I wasn't born in this country,

31:14.540 --> 31:17.875
so my experience and history
with racism is different,

31:17.951 --> 31:19.543
but this is a mistake.

31:19.620 --> 31:22.329
I believe Cain can be redeemed.

31:22.405 --> 31:25.883
You're wrong.
People don't change.

31:25.959 --> 31:29.052
Okay, well,
here's the bottom line.

31:29.129 --> 31:31.171
I've listened
to your input, Mina,

31:31.247 --> 31:33.173
but at the end of the day,

31:33.249 --> 31:35.508
it's my decision
whether to report him or not.

31:35.585 --> 31:37.385
Not yours.

31:37.396 --> 31:41.306
And I need you to respect that.

31:41.383 --> 31:45.986
Are you asking me as m--
as my colleague or my boyfriend?

31:48.148 --> 31:51.366
-Does it matter?
-What you do matters to me.

31:57.491 --> 32:00.575
-How did it go with Jake?
<i> -BELL (over phone): Not well.</i>

32:00.586 --> 32:02.577
-Oh, I'm sorry, Randolph.
<i> -You know, I've always</i>

32:02.588 --> 32:04.996
felt guilty about leaving him.

32:05.073 --> 32:08.258
And-- He needed a father.

32:08.335 --> 32:11.929
<i> And I'm not so sure</i>
<i> about the choices he's made.</i>

32:12.005 --> 32:14.089
-Can you do anything about it?
<i> -No, he's--</i>

32:14.099 --> 32:16.758
he's a grown man, he's moved on.

32:16.769 --> 32:21.262
And I think my chance to have
any positive impact on him

32:21.273 --> 32:22.931
-has passed me by.
<i> -You can't give up</i>

32:22.942 --> 32:24.432
<i> so easily, Randolph.</i>

32:24.443 --> 32:25.776
Put up a fight.

32:25.852 --> 32:27.435
Oh, I have to hang up.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.855
It's time to ambush
the CEO of Red Rock.

32:30.932 --> 32:33.116
<i> -What?</i>
-ASSISTANT: And your lunch

32:33.193 --> 32:35.452
is at 12:30 and--
Sir, I'll call security.

32:35.529 --> 32:39.280
It's okay. Dr. Voss
isn't here to hurt me.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.573
Although, given her mastery
of the spine,

32:40.650 --> 32:43.034
I'm sure she could.

32:43.111 --> 32:45.462
Listen, I'm sorry you got
the cold shoulder all day,

32:45.539 --> 32:47.414
but my assistant,
she's a bit overprotective.

32:47.490 --> 32:50.125
All will be forgiven
if you answer one question:

32:50.135 --> 32:53.095
who's replacing
Logan Kim as CEO?

32:54.330 --> 32:56.297
Chastain isn't
getting a new CEO.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.757
I don't understand.
Someone has to be in charge.

32:57.834 --> 33:01.061
Who's gonna run the hospital?

33:04.174 --> 33:05.390
<i> CONRAD:</i>
<i> Dr. Voss expects</i>

33:05.467 --> 33:07.142
you'll be up
and walking again soon.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.986
She said I had lesions
on my spine.

33:09.062 --> 33:11.154
-Please tell me
you know what I have.
-We do.

33:11.231 --> 33:13.231
You have a parasitic worm
called a Schistosoma.

33:13.308 --> 33:15.817
And your spinal lesion biopsy
confirmed it.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.819
CONRAD:
They're usually found in places

33:17.830 --> 33:22.374
like the Middle East,
Southeast Asia, the Caribbean.

33:23.359 --> 33:24.951
The Caribbean?

33:25.028 --> 33:26.244
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are

33:26.321 --> 33:28.246
that we had the time
and the patience

33:28.323 --> 33:29.956
to figure out
what was going wrong with you

33:30.033 --> 33:31.508
before your organs failed,
despite...

33:31.585 --> 33:33.001
-Devon.
-No, no, no.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.669
She needs to hear this.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.296
You lied to us.

33:36.372 --> 33:39.007
We have sick people out there
who need our attention,

33:39.018 --> 33:41.018
but we were stuck here wading
through your nonsense.

33:41.094 --> 33:42.102
CONRAD:
Let me talk to her.

33:49.719 --> 33:52.812
We put you on antiparasitics
for the next four weeks.

33:52.889 --> 33:55.407
James is on them, too.

34:03.650 --> 34:07.285
Keeping secrets from
your doctors can kill you.

34:07.362 --> 34:08.453
I don't want you to think
I'm just another politician

34:08.530 --> 34:10.163
who had an affair.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.956
-I am not here to judge you.
-Well, that's what

34:12.033 --> 34:14.292
people do unless
you give them context.

34:14.369 --> 34:17.045
You know, I represent
the district I grew up in

34:17.056 --> 34:17.879
in Atlanta.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.714
I love my people.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.558
And I've been able to
make a difference where change

34:21.635 --> 34:23.635
is hard to come by.

34:23.711 --> 34:26.221
At first,
my husband understood that.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.398
When we met,
he was an NFL megastar

34:28.475 --> 34:31.068
and I was a judge
in small-claims court.

34:31.144 --> 34:34.237
Now no one asks him
about football.

34:34.314 --> 34:36.356
They ask him what it's like
to be married to me.

34:36.432 --> 34:39.451
And his ego can't handle that.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.820
But James...

34:41.896 --> 34:43.914
Yeah?

34:43.990 --> 34:47.075
He'd love to tell people what
it's like to be married to you.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.660
(scoffs softly)

34:48.736 --> 34:50.078
Yes, sir.

34:50.089 --> 34:53.206
He's a good man, my James.

34:53.283 --> 34:56.093
While my husband might not
sleep with me anymore,

34:56.169 --> 34:57.761
but he will do
a press conference tomorrow

34:57.838 --> 35:00.255
and say, "My wife is stronger
than half the men

35:00.265 --> 35:02.340
I played football with.
No bug's gonna stop her."

35:02.417 --> 35:06.010
But if I was outed as unfaithful
to Atlanta's favorite son,

35:06.087 --> 35:08.221
I would never make it
to the governor's mansion.

35:08.298 --> 35:09.764
You know we're duty bound
to keep

35:09.775 --> 35:11.224
your personal life confidential.

35:11.301 --> 35:12.776
I know.

35:12.853 --> 35:17.114
But it will get out eventually.

35:26.199 --> 35:28.416
Can you ask James to
come in here?

35:37.493 --> 35:39.177
(door opens)

35:44.050 --> 35:45.550
She almost died
keeping a secret.

35:45.627 --> 35:47.227
Anything you want to tell me?

35:52.317 --> 35:54.475
After the memorial,
I went to the hospital

35:54.486 --> 35:55.819
where my dad died.

35:55.896 --> 35:58.438
I found the resident
that took care of him.

35:58.514 --> 36:02.325
It was a good guy,
reminded me of you actually.

36:05.688 --> 36:08.999
They were understaffed,
too few vents.

36:09.075 --> 36:11.326
One nurse for every
ten patients.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.994
We have one nurse
for every two patients.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.079
They intubated him.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.624
He was stable until,
like, 2:00 a.m.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.460
His sat dropped,
heart rate started to slow.

36:20.536 --> 36:22.012
Ten minutes went by.

36:22.088 --> 36:24.181
And when they finally
got to him, he was gone.

36:24.257 --> 36:26.591
Cardiac arrest.

36:26.668 --> 36:28.968
My father, he died alone

36:29.045 --> 36:31.471
because his public hospital,
in a poor brown neighborhood,

36:31.547 --> 36:35.066
didn't have enough resources
to save him.

36:35.143 --> 36:37.402
I'm so, so sorry, man.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.587
When the,
when the resident was...

36:57.573 --> 37:01.551
When he was rereading his notes,

37:01.628 --> 37:03.711
he started to cry.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.964
And I said to him,

37:06.040 --> 37:08.716
"Hey, l-look, we all have
that patient we know

37:08.727 --> 37:11.010
we could have saved."

37:11.087 --> 37:14.305
And he said to me,

37:14.382 --> 37:18.068
"If only it had just been one."

37:18.144 --> 37:20.153
There had been dozens.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.160
(ventilator hissing)

37:29.272 --> 37:33.408
We'll continue to monitor him
but, uh, his prognosis is good.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.586
(sighs)
Dr. Cain said the same thing.

37:36.663 --> 37:38.421
He stopped by.

37:39.449 --> 37:42.217
His words were such a comfort.

37:44.245 --> 37:49.099
We are indebted to him, to all
of you, for saving Ben's life.

37:53.588 --> 37:56.147
Mrs. Mullins, there's something
you should know.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.453
You went behind my back
and told the Mullins about Cain.

38:10.530 --> 38:12.622
-I explicitly told you not to.
-Oh.

38:12.699 --> 38:14.115
Now they're suing.

38:14.126 --> 38:14.958
You weren't listening to reason.

38:15.035 --> 38:16.626
I was listening to my gut.

38:16.703 --> 38:19.129
Which tells me to believe
in Cain's redemption.

38:19.205 --> 38:20.630
You don't get to override that,
Mina.

38:20.707 --> 38:22.457
Barrett Cain broke the first
tenet of our profession,

38:22.467 --> 38:24.301
"do no harm."

38:24.377 --> 38:25.626
He shouldn't be allowed
to practice medicine.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.471
I did you a favor.
I did us all a favor.

38:28.548 --> 38:30.256
You didn't do anybody a favor.

38:30.333 --> 38:31.966
You just carried out
your own verdict

38:31.977 --> 38:33.259
in Mina's kangaroo court.

38:33.336 --> 38:35.312
And you disrespected me.

38:37.557 --> 38:40.933
If you're looking for me
to apologize,

38:41.010 --> 38:42.694
that's not happening.

38:44.156 --> 38:46.898
You know, by my count,
it's been nine

38:46.974 --> 38:50.234
consecutive nights of
soul-stirring sex

38:50.311 --> 38:51.944
-and unparalleled conversation.
-Mm.

38:52.021 --> 38:53.488
And, though I will deny
ever saying this,

38:53.498 --> 38:55.573
my back hurts.

38:55.650 --> 38:57.241
Are you suggesting
we take a break?

38:57.318 --> 38:59.619
-Yes.
-Agreed.

38:59.695 --> 39:01.287
Two nights.

39:01.364 --> 39:02.714
Three.

39:04.492 --> 39:05.917
Agreed.

39:05.993 --> 39:09.346
Rest your back

39:09.422 --> 39:12.265
Yeah. And you reconsider, too.
