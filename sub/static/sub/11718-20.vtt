Can I help you?

00:38.749 --> 00:40.750
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's just a flat tire.

00:40.801 --> 00:43.719
I've got a tow truck coming.

00:52.563 --> 00:54.013
Are you sure?

00:54.047 --> 00:57.316
I can give you a hand
fixing that.

00:57.351 --> 00:58.717
Oh, no, I'm fine.

00:58.735 --> 01:00.353
It's okay.

01:00.387 --> 01:01.771
I've got it under control.

01:01.822 --> 01:03.722
Don't worry about it.

Look, the tow truck's
coming.

03:34.975 --> 03:36.375
Uh. (chuckles)

03:36.393 --> 03:38.010
Why, uh, would somebody want

03:38.044 --> 03:39.979
to steal your shrimp truck,
Kamekona?

03:40.013 --> 03:43.015
That's your job!
I need you to figure it out.

03:43.049 --> 03:45.101
Figure out what? I'm guessing
that there's not a major demand

03:45.152 --> 03:47.269
for a big yellow truck
with your face on it.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.638
Well, I was hoping for some
preferential Five-O treatment

03:49.673 --> 03:52.358

our relationship, but...

03:52.392 --> 03:53.559
Preferential...

03:53.577 --> 03:55.778
Okay, um...

03:55.829 --> 03:57.079
pretty sure
you're aware of this,

03:57.114 --> 03:59.615
but we are a major crimes
task force, okay?

03:59.666 --> 04:01.567
We don't exactly do
missing shrimp trucks.

04:01.585 --> 04:04.069
Major crime.
This is super-major crime!

04:04.087 --> 04:05.404
All my secret recipes

04:05.422 --> 04:07.039
is in there.

Excuse me-- secret?

04:08.341 --> 04:09.341
What are you,
Orville Redenbacher?

04:09.376 --> 04:10.793
It's no secret.

04:10.844 --> 04:12.911
You got garlic, you got butter,
and you got shrimp. That's it.

04:12.929 --> 04:16.015
Yo, it's all about
the proportions.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.750
You know how much
those recipes are worth?

04:17.767 --> 04:20.052
I have no idea.

04:20.086 --> 04:21.353
Priceless, brah.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.557
Okay. I will, uh...

Excuse me.

Hey, where's McGarrett?

05:04.431 --> 05:06.849
He left a dear Danny" note
on my desk this morning.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.101
He's off looking
for Shelburne again.

05:09.135 --> 05:10.653
So, he just picked up and left?

05:10.687 --> 05:12.638
Guy's on a mission.
What are you going to do?

05:12.656 --> 05:13.656
All right.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.491
Let's hope he gets some answers.
Yes.

05:15.525 --> 05:16.692
What do we got?

05:16.743 --> 05:18.277
Farm workers found her
this morning.

05:18.311 --> 05:20.913
Got an ID?
No, nothing.

05:20.947 --> 05:22.448
It's a good place
to dump a body.

05:22.482 --> 05:24.116
Good morning, Max.

05:24.150 --> 05:25.317
Cause of death?

05:29.923 --> 05:31.423
DANNY:
Hey, Max?

05:31.458 --> 05:34.126
Cause of death?
Time of death?

05:34.160 --> 05:35.377
Anything, please?

05:35.428 --> 05:36.345
Max, hello?

05:36.379 --> 05:37.546
Cause of death

05:37.597 --> 05:39.765
is manual asphyxiation
due to chest constriction.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.718
That's it?

05:42.769 --> 05:44.670
CHIN:
Max, how about

05:44.704 --> 05:46.405
an approximate time of death?

05:49.142 --> 05:50.843
Yes, um, I'm sorry.

05:50.861 --> 05:53.946
Uh, time of death is somewhere
between 10:00 and midnight.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.982
And she wasn't killed here.

05:58.201 --> 05:59.902
You okay, buddy?

05:59.953 --> 06:01.320
Yeah.

06:01.354 --> 06:03.322
I just need to get her
back to the morgue.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.975
(phone rings)

06:07.994 --> 06:09.795
Hey, what's up?

06:11.832 --> 06:13.365
Yeah, we're on our way.

06:13.383 --> 06:14.300
That was Kono.

06:14.334 --> 06:16.502
She might have found
the victim's car.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.390
KONO:
<i>All right, so I ran</i>

06:21.424 --> 06:23.425
the vehicle's registration.
I got a DMV photo.

06:23.476 --> 06:25.477
Is that your victim?

06:25.512 --> 06:26.478
Yes.

06:26.513 --> 06:27.897
Angela O'Hara,

06:27.931 --> 06:30.232
23. She lived with her mother
in Pearl City.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.718
Car had a flat.

06:32.736 --> 06:35.271
This is a hell of a place
to break down.

06:35.322 --> 06:36.555
She didn't have a spare?

06:36.573 --> 06:38.607
KONO: No, she called for a tow
around 8:30 last night.

06:38.642 --> 06:39.842
But when
the truck arrived,

06:39.876 --> 06:41.443
there was no driver present,

06:41.494 --> 06:43.245
so they left.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.614
All right, looks to me like
there's a crime opportunity.

06:45.665 --> 06:48.334
Killer drives by, sees this lady.
She's broken down.

06:48.368 --> 06:51.036
Cuz, you got something?

06:51.071 --> 06:52.588
This flat was no accident.

06:57.911 --> 07:00.880
Somebody put a razor blade
in her tire tread.

07:02.098 --> 07:03.649
Her killer planned this.

07:03.683 --> 07:05.184
(screaming)

07:16.056 --> 07:18.741
(woman sobbing)

07:21.645 --> 07:23.629
Ms. O'Hara, I'm...

07:23.647 --> 07:25.348
I'm so sorry for your loss.

07:25.399 --> 07:28.351
Uh, there's just some questions
I have to ask you

07:28.402 --> 07:30.486
that can help
with our investigation, okay?

07:30.521 --> 07:31.921
Is that all right?

07:33.140 --> 07:35.775
I knew something was wrong.

07:37.995 --> 07:40.980
I got a call from... her work

07:40.998 --> 07:44.450
saying that Angela
missed her shift.

07:44.484 --> 07:46.252
Where did she work?

07:46.287 --> 07:49.205
Mana Kai Catamaran.

07:49.256 --> 07:51.207
They do those, uh,

07:51.258 --> 07:54.243
those sightseeing boat tours
around the island.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.135
Did she suffer?

08:02.186 --> 08:04.404
Did my daughter suffer?

08:07.458 --> 08:08.975
(sobs)

08:09.009 --> 08:11.677
Oh, my God.

08:17.284 --> 08:20.320
Um, could you,
uh... tell me.

08:20.354 --> 08:22.205
Do what remember
what time she left for work?

08:25.626 --> 08:27.243
(sighs)

08:28.796 --> 08:30.663
She left earlier than usual.

08:30.697 --> 08:31.864
(sighs)

08:31.882 --> 08:34.583
Okay, I know this is, uh,

08:34.635 --> 08:36.635
really difficult for you.
Um...

08:38.222 --> 08:40.206
But if you could tell me,
uh, anything,

08:40.224 --> 08:42.140
anything that you remember, uh,

08:42.176 --> 08:43.509
anything she might
have mentioned,

08:43.543 --> 08:45.211
it would be really helpful.

08:47.097 --> 08:49.148
She got a...
she got a phone call

08:49.183 --> 08:51.134
right before
she left for work.

08:51.168 --> 08:54.553
And she came to tell me
that she was leaving...

08:55.606 --> 08:58.358
And I didn't even...

09:00.244 --> 09:04.230
(sobbing): I didn't look up
to say good-bye!

09:05.165 --> 09:07.533
Okay.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.202
Oh, um...

09:10.337 --> 09:14.073
Does the company that she work
for, are they, uh...

09:14.091 --> 09:15.625
are they up on the North Shore?

09:15.676 --> 09:18.961
No, they were in Waikiki.

09:19.012 --> 09:21.247
Okay, uh...

09:22.549 --> 09:24.417
a long away from
where we found her car.

09:24.435 --> 09:26.886
Is there anything
you might know why

09:26.920 --> 09:29.088
she'd be up there
on the North Shore?

09:32.443 --> 09:34.110
No, no, I don't know.

09:37.948 --> 09:39.782
Okay.

09:41.435 --> 09:43.619
Okay.

09:43.654 --> 09:45.238
I'm sorry.

09:47.291 --> 09:50.526
CHIN:
Hey, guys, I got something.

09:52.463 --> 09:54.447
Looks like our vic
was being followed.

09:54.465 --> 09:57.616
I found a GPS tracking device
under her car.

10:00.804 --> 10:01.921
I believe this model
has a Web site

10:01.955 --> 10:04.257
that allows users to
monitor the GPS remote.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.225
Okay. Well, let's pull up
an IP address.

10:06.260 --> 10:08.728
See who was monitoring
our victim.

10:11.432 --> 10:12.765
CHIN:
<i>So, we traced the GPS</i>

10:12.799 --> 10:14.050
we found
on Angela O'Hara's car

10:14.084 --> 10:16.469
back to an IP address
registered to this guy.

10:18.071 --> 10:19.071
Cal Litoa.

10:19.106 --> 10:20.823
Okay, so this guy's tracking her
the whole time.

10:20.858 --> 10:23.409
Mm-hmm, according to the GPS,
the last place she stopped

10:23.444 --> 10:25.411
before her car broke down
was a bar on the North Shore.

10:25.446 --> 10:28.030
Okay, I bet that is where he put
the razor blade in her tire.

10:28.081 --> 10:29.332
Matches up with
Fong's estimates too.

10:29.366 --> 10:31.868
Okay, tell me about this guy.
What do we know?

10:31.919 --> 10:33.986
CHIN:
All right...

10:34.004 --> 10:37.473
Cal Litoa:
misdemeanor possession charge...

10:37.508 --> 10:39.375
Last year it looks like
his ex-girlfriend took out

10:39.426 --> 10:41.878
a restraining order against him
after he broke into her apartment

10:41.929 --> 10:43.329
following an argument.
Good.

10:43.347 --> 10:46.282
Uh, what is the connection
to our victim Angela O'Hara?

10:50.254 --> 10:52.638
They both worked
the Mana Kai Catamaran.

10:57.694 --> 10:59.445
DANNY: Listen to me. List...
Don't move.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.013
Sit down and don't move.

11:01.031 --> 11:04.784
CHIN: We need you to tell us why
you were tracking Angela O'Hara.

11:04.818 --> 11:06.285
I can explain.
Good, good.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.521
Start with why we found her body
in a pineapple field

11:08.539 --> 11:11.574
up on the North Shore.
My God. What?

11:11.625 --> 11:12.959
She's dead.

11:14.044 --> 11:15.962
Cal, listen to me.

11:15.996 --> 11:18.764
We know it was your
GPS, but somebody--

11:18.799 --> 11:20.917
I'm not saying it was you--
I just want your help--

11:20.951 --> 11:22.985
somebody put razor blades
in her tire.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.170
Now, you see

11:24.204 --> 11:25.805
where this is going,
don't you, Cal?

11:25.839 --> 11:28.474
Look, I admit
I put the GPS there,

11:28.509 --> 11:30.643
but I thought she
was cheating on me.

11:30.677 --> 11:32.461
She was your girlfriend?
Yeah.

11:32.496 --> 11:34.230
We had to keep it
on the down low,

11:34.264 --> 11:36.265
'cause of work and her m-mother.
Her mother didn't like you?

11:36.300 --> 11:38.518
I can't imagine why not.
Look, man,

11:38.552 --> 11:39.936
you got to believe me.

11:39.987 --> 11:41.654
Okay, relax.
Sit back and relax.

11:41.688 --> 11:44.907
Tell me something: when's
the last time you spoke to her?

11:44.942 --> 11:46.526
Last night.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.079
She called, she said she...
was gonna be late to work.

11:50.113 --> 11:51.447
She say why?

11:51.498 --> 11:52.865
No.

11:52.899 --> 11:55.201
Okay, so you followed her,
found out

11:55.235 --> 11:57.286
she was cheating on you,
you did some bad things--

11:57.337 --> 11:58.504
I understand.
No!

11:58.539 --> 11:59.956
Sit down!
Don't stand up again, okay?

11:59.990 --> 12:01.457
I was working.

12:01.508 --> 12:02.575
You can ask my manager.

12:02.593 --> 12:05.695
Okay. I'm gonna go talk
to your manager.

12:05.729 --> 12:07.913
If I find out you're lying
to me, I'm gonna come back here,

12:07.931 --> 12:09.382
I'm gonna put you
in a mayonnaise jar.

12:09.416 --> 12:10.550
Okay?

12:10.584 --> 12:12.218
Unbelievable.

12:13.136 --> 12:14.587
Uh.

12:20.561 --> 12:23.779
Manager says the kid didn't
get off the boat till 10:30.

12:23.814 --> 12:25.815
You're good.
Well, that's not enough time

12:25.866 --> 12:27.366
to make it to
the North Shore,

12:27.401 --> 12:28.784
put razor blades in
Angela O'Hara's tires

12:28.819 --> 12:31.070
(phone ringing)
and then wait for her to get a flat.

12:31.104 --> 12:33.589
No, he's definitely
not our guy.

12:33.624 --> 12:34.890
Yes, Kamekona.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.710
Yo. Any updates
on my missing truck?

12:37.744 --> 12:39.362
CHIN:
Missing truck?

12:40.631 --> 12:43.082
Hey, uh, yeah,
Kono is all over it.

12:43.116 --> 12:46.385
Turns out that she has a nose
for missing shrimp trucks.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.070
90% clearance rate,
I believe.

12:48.105 --> 12:50.756
Plus, we have the female
intuition thing going for us,

12:50.790 --> 12:52.758
so I think we're in good shape.

12:53.627 --> 12:56.612
Yes, she's making it
a priority.

12:56.647 --> 12:58.681
Unbelievable. You know somebody
stole Kamekona's shrimp truck?

12:58.732 --> 13:00.983
Did you just volunteer Kono?
I did.

13:01.018 --> 13:02.518
She know about this?
No, she doesn't,

13:02.552 --> 13:04.220
and I would really appreciate
some assistance here

13:04.254 --> 13:05.571
seeing as this
is a local crime,

13:05.606 --> 13:06.822
and I'm not too hip
to local crimes

13:06.857 --> 13:08.691
like missing shrimp trucks.
Wait a minute here.

13:08.742 --> 13:10.610
Oh, no, don't worry.
We got leads.

13:10.644 --> 13:13.646
We're in good shape.

13:13.664 --> 13:16.415
Really? Richie the shrimp guy?
Yeah.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.316
The Duke brothers?

13:17.375 --> 13:20.000
Oh, "a disgruntled customer
wearing a Metallica shirt."

13:20.100 --> 13:21.810
Yeah. So you like
the disgruntled customer

13:21.811 --> 13:23.498
for this one
or Richie the shrimp guy?

13:23.657 --> 13:24.657
Who steals a shrimp truck?

13:24.675 --> 13:26.125
I don't know.
I said the same thing.

13:26.159 --> 13:28.010
But that is the mission,
should you choose to accept.

13:28.045 --> 13:29.328
Please.

13:29.346 --> 13:31.180
All right, I'll make
a couple of calls.

13:31.214 --> 13:34.433
That's the least I can do.
Thank you. And I will loop Kono in.

13:34.468 --> 13:36.052
We got to help
the big guy, you know?

13:36.103 --> 13:38.521
Plus, I am becoming very
partial to garlic shrimp.

13:38.555 --> 13:40.940
(chuckles):
Oh-ho-ho. Just a matter of time.

13:40.974 --> 13:42.775
Whoa, whoa, stop.
What does that mean?

13:42.809 --> 13:44.360
Plate lunches
at local grinds.

13:44.394 --> 13:46.178
You're practically
(speaks Hawaiian), bro.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.864
Did I say that I was jumping aboard
to any local customs, Don Ho?

13:48.899 --> 13:50.316
No, I didn't.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.151
I just said that
I liked the garlic shrimp.

13:52.185 --> 13:54.437
Which, in fact,
is basically scampi.

13:54.471 --> 13:56.322
And that is not island food
at all; it's Italian.

13:56.356 --> 13:58.157
(phone ringing)

13:58.959 --> 14:01.744
Look who's calling.
Yes, Max?

14:03.997 --> 14:06.048
I've completed
the autopsy

14:06.083 --> 14:08.668
and found some
troubling anomalies.

14:12.172 --> 14:14.423
What is this, a Boy Scout test?

14:14.458 --> 14:16.392
I failed the knots.
Uh, no, Detective.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.427
It is a Solomon bar rope cuff.

14:18.462 --> 14:20.529
I took the liberty
to mock one up.

14:21.598 --> 14:24.133
It's a knot used
to bind wrists,

14:24.167 --> 14:25.718
and as you can see,

14:25.736 --> 14:27.937
it has a very
distinctive pattern,

14:27.988 --> 14:29.722
a pattern that
matches exactly

14:29.740 --> 14:31.657
the one we found
on our victim's wrist...

14:31.692 --> 14:33.609
and ankles.
But no ropes

14:33.660 --> 14:34.860
were found
at the crime scene.

14:34.894 --> 14:36.395
Well, but I did
recover some fiber,

14:36.413 --> 14:38.948
which leads me to believe that
the killer removed the ropes

14:38.999 --> 14:40.116
after he asphyxiated her.

14:40.167 --> 14:43.536
Which brings me to
my second anomaly.

14:45.706 --> 14:47.223
The victim's ribs
were cracked

14:47.257 --> 14:49.375
on both sides of
the sternal bone.

14:49.409 --> 14:51.727
Ultrasound revealed
that there was damage

14:51.762 --> 14:54.013
to the subclavian artery,
which suggests

14:54.047 --> 14:55.581
that the killer knelt

14:55.599 --> 14:57.550
on the victim and
blocked her airways.

14:57.584 --> 15:00.102
That, combined with
the constricted lung capacity,

15:00.137 --> 15:01.587
caused her death.

15:01.605 --> 15:03.939
Okay, so we have

15:03.974 --> 15:06.892
a whack job who likes to tie up
women and smother them.

15:06.926 --> 15:09.729
Well, this is no whack job,
Detective Williams.

15:09.763 --> 15:13.115
This is a killer that left
a distinct signature

15:13.150 --> 15:15.284
and then attempted
to hide or mitigate it.

15:15.318 --> 15:16.702
It's the Trashman.

15:16.737 --> 15:18.871
Very good, Lieutenant Kelly.

15:18.905 --> 15:19.938
DANNY:
I'm sorry.

15:19.956 --> 15:21.106
What's the Trashman?

15:21.124 --> 15:22.691
The M.O. is the exact same

15:22.726 --> 15:24.293
as a serial killer
dubbed the Trashman.

15:24.327 --> 15:26.796
He was known for discarding
his victims in trash bags

15:26.830 --> 15:28.364
along the side of the road.

15:29.132 --> 15:30.166
That is correct.

15:30.217 --> 15:32.301
The problem is,
the Trashman's in prison.

15:32.335 --> 15:35.287
Technically, a man
named Richard Branch

15:35.305 --> 15:37.723
was arrested
for one of the murders.

15:37.758 --> 15:39.892
Okay, what do you mean,
technically?

15:40.927 --> 15:42.595
You don't think he did it?

15:42.629 --> 15:44.146
No.

15:44.181 --> 15:47.216
I believe the real Trashman
is still out there.

15:54.699 --> 15:56.951
Richard Branch was accused
<i>of murdering six women.</i>

15:56.985 --> 15:59.994
The first one was found on the
H2 in 1985, and the last one

15:59.995 --> 16:01.262
in 2009.

16:01.296 --> 16:02.763
Shortly after that,
he was arrested,

16:02.798 --> 16:04.048
convicted and
sentenced to life.

16:04.099 --> 16:05.766
MAX: Each of his victims
were bound,

16:05.801 --> 16:08.269
asphyxiated and dumped on the
side of the road in trash bags.

16:08.303 --> 16:09.937
As you can see,
the injuries

16:09.972 --> 16:11.672
are an exact match
to our current victim,

16:11.690 --> 16:12.773
Angela O'Hara.

16:12.808 --> 16:15.059
CHIN: All right, well,
Branch is in prison,

16:15.093 --> 16:16.852
so we must be looking
for a copycat killer.

16:16.877 --> 16:17.945
No, no, no.

16:17.946 --> 16:20.648
Then why remove the Solomon
bar cuff thingy, right?

16:20.682 --> 16:22.733
I mean, if he wanted us
to think he was the Trashman,

16:22.784 --> 16:24.685
he would've left the ropes on, no?
As I stated earlier,

16:24.703 --> 16:27.204
Richard Branch is
<i>not</i> the Trashman,

16:27.239 --> 16:28.789
and thus we
are not looking

16:28.824 --> 16:30.825
for a copycat killer.
They arrested him.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.793
They tried him and convicted
him for the crimes, Max.

16:32.828 --> 16:34.628
CHIN: Yeah, but they were
only able to tie him

16:34.663 --> 16:36.464
to one of the Trashman murders.
Correct.

16:36.498 --> 16:38.716
In order to ensure
a conviction,

16:38.750 --> 16:40.101
the prosecuting
attorney's office tried him

16:40.135 --> 16:41.552
only for the murder
of Diane Gallo,

16:41.586 --> 16:44.138
the last victim attributed to
the Trashman.

16:44.172 --> 16:47.391
CHIN: Yeah, Branch was a drifter,
and he fit the profile.

16:47.426 --> 16:50.011
Plus, they found his DNA
on one of the trash bags

16:50.045 --> 16:51.645
containing her body.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.180
His file says they
got an eyewitness,

16:53.214 --> 16:55.208
an eyewitness that
puts this guy with the

16:55.233 --> 16:57.107
victim moments before
the crime takes place.

16:57.108 --> 16:59.676
Eyewitness testimonials
are notoriously unreliable.

16:59.771 --> 17:02.355
They got his DNA, Max,
on one of the victims.

17:02.357 --> 17:04.134
There's an alternate
explanation for the presence

17:04.135 --> 17:06.494
of Richard Branch's DNA
at the crime scene.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.413
CHIN:
Time-out, time-out, time-out.

17:08.446 --> 17:10.498
Why don't we just
pay him a visit?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.032
I can arrange that.

17:13.035 --> 17:14.335
You're in contact
with Richard Branch?

17:14.368 --> 17:17.371
Yes. We share an interest
in acrostic puzzles.

17:17.405 --> 17:19.156
Why doesn't that surprise me?

(chuckles) Well, he ain't in here.
That's for sure.

I am.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.367

Detective Williams

17:52.407 --> 17:54.492
are familiar with your case.
Yeah, so were

17:54.543 --> 17:56.944
the cops who pinned
all these murders on me

17:56.962 --> 17:58.712
without a speck of evidence.

17:58.747 --> 18:00.247
No, not without
a speck of evidence.

18:00.281 --> 18:02.049
Your DNA was

18:03.335 --> 18:05.953
been over this a million times.

18:05.971 --> 18:08.222
He killed again.

18:08.256 --> 18:10.791
If we can prove that
this is the Trashman,

18:10.809 --> 18:13.561
they might reopen your case.

18:13.595 --> 18:15.346
Eh...
Richard...

18:15.397 --> 18:17.648
this could help you.

end up on the body

18:37.119 --> 18:38.369
of Diane Gallo?

18:38.420 --> 18:40.421
I was out looking
for returnables

18:40.455 --> 18:42.123
when I found the bag.

18:42.157 --> 18:44.158
Thought I'd hit the jackpot...

18:44.176 --> 18:47.161
till I opened up the bag
and reached in.

18:47.179 --> 18:49.964
And you touched
the body, huh?

18:51.550 --> 18:55.102
I'll never forget the look
on that poor woman's face.

18:55.137 --> 18:58.088
What that guy did to her.

18:59.174 --> 19:01.842
Okay, what'd you do after that?

19:01.860 --> 19:03.978
This guy...

19:04.012 --> 19:08.616
drives by and sees me there
with... this woman's body

19:08.650 --> 19:11.035

19:11.069 --> 19:14.155
I saw that look in his face.

19:14.189 --> 19:15.689
I knew.

19:15.707 --> 19:16.991
So you ran?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.692
(grunts)

19:18.710 --> 19:20.544
It doesn't take a genius

19:20.579 --> 19:22.963
to pencil out
how this was gonna end.

19:22.998 --> 19:24.331
I had a record.

19:24.365 --> 19:26.550
I knew the police
were looking for this guy,

19:26.585 --> 19:29.286
and there I'm standing
over one of the victims?

19:29.321 --> 19:31.555
Well, what about the eyewitness
who saw you with the victim

19:31.590 --> 19:34.008
before the murder?
How the hell should I know?!

19:34.042 --> 19:37.995
I-I fit the description:
middle-aged white guy!

19:40.348 --> 19:42.850
Truth...

19:42.884 --> 19:46.270
is, I never met that woman.

19:46.321 --> 19:49.657
But those cops, now, they had a
different version

19:49.691 --> 19:53.360
of events, and they kept me
in that room all day

19:53.394 --> 19:56.997
and all night until
I signed that confession.

19:57.032 --> 19:59.533
Mr. Branch was under
the influence of narcotics.

19:59.567 --> 20:01.418

as an opportunity to take
a break and cover his tracks.

21:26.654 --> 21:28.756
So then why start
killing again now?

21:28.790 --> 21:30.490
Serial killers have
poor impulse control.

21:30.508 --> 21:32.009
He couldn't help himself.

21:32.043 --> 21:33.427
Okay, so what you're saying is,

21:33.461 --> 21:34.995
this guy comes
out of retirement,

21:35.013 --> 21:37.798
kills Angela O'Hara,
and then he changes his M.O.

21:37.832 --> 21:40.567
to throw us off?
Yes!

21:44.973 --> 21:48.726
Five-O once asked me
to reopen an investigation.

21:48.777 --> 21:52.596
Now I'm asking you
to do the same.

21:55.867 --> 21:57.418
Please.

21:59.321 --> 22:01.322
All right.

22:01.356 --> 22:03.857
I know one
of the original detectives

22:03.875 --> 22:05.376
from the Trashman case.
Al Shepard.

22:05.410 --> 22:06.794
He's retired now, but...

22:06.828 --> 22:08.629
DANNY: Okay, we will
go see him,

22:08.663 --> 22:10.697
and we'll see what he thinks
about your theory, okay?

22:10.715 --> 22:11.698
Thank you.

22:14.786 --> 22:18.088
I was hoping this day
would never come.

22:18.139 --> 22:19.640
What do you mean?

22:19.674 --> 22:22.376
You got to understand
the pressure

22:22.394 --> 22:24.561
we were under to make an arrest.

22:24.596 --> 22:26.480
Mayor's office
was all over us,

22:26.514 --> 22:28.682
the press had the island
in a panic, said we were

22:28.716 --> 22:30.934
affecting tourism.
Okay, but you did

22:30.985 --> 22:33.153
put Branch away
for the Trashman slayings.

22:33.188 --> 22:34.388
We only had enough evidence

22:34.406 --> 22:36.490
to convict him
of one of the murders.

22:36.524 --> 22:38.859
Everyone believed
that he was the Trashman.

22:38.893 --> 22:40.611
My partner believed he was.

22:41.896 --> 22:44.081
But I had my doubts.

22:44.115 --> 22:47.034
Okay, why weren't you able
to tie him to the other murders?

22:47.068 --> 22:49.903
Branch was a drifter,
in and out of drug rehab.

22:49.921 --> 22:52.539
The evidence against him
was all circumstantial.

22:52.573 --> 22:54.408
Oh, so you just got him
to confess.

22:54.426 --> 22:56.877
After spending 30 hours
in the box with us grilling him,

22:56.911 --> 22:58.679
he would have copped
to the OJ murders.

22:58.713 --> 23:00.264
So, you're saying
you got the wrong guy?

23:00.298 --> 23:02.933
I'm saying, there's a lot

23:02.967 --> 23:04.885
to the case
that didn't make sense.

23:04.919 --> 23:06.253
Okay, well, we're here.

23:06.271 --> 23:08.555
We'd like to know what it is
that doesn't make sense.

23:08.589 --> 23:11.725
There was another murder
that wasn't attributed

23:11.759 --> 23:15.396
to the Trashman,
but I think it <i>was</i> his work.

23:15.430 --> 23:16.897
Woman named

23:16.931 --> 23:18.598
Jennifer Ravich.

23:18.616 --> 23:20.951
She predated the other murders
by about five years,

23:20.985 --> 23:22.453
but just like your victim,

23:22.487 --> 23:25.739
she wasn't found
in a bag or bound.

23:25.773 --> 23:26.773
She have cracked ribs, too?

23:26.791 --> 23:28.158
Yeah.

23:28.209 --> 23:30.544
And there was evidence
that she'd <i>been</i> bound.

23:30.578 --> 23:33.464
But she was older
than the other victims,

23:33.498 --> 23:36.450
so we ruled it out because
it didn't fit the profile.

23:36.468 --> 23:38.669
And you didn't push it?

23:38.720 --> 23:42.005
No. Branch was
in a rehab facility

23:42.056 --> 23:43.841
when Jennifer Ravich was killed.

23:43.892 --> 23:46.176
Would have blown the whole case
wide open.

23:46.227 --> 23:47.511
DANNY:
So the prosecuting

23:47.562 --> 23:49.796
attorney's office just swept it
under the rug?

23:49.814 --> 23:52.850
And I let 'em.

23:52.901 --> 23:54.601
KONO:
<i>Okay, so,</i>

23:54.635 --> 23:57.271
I pulled Jennifer Ravich's case
file from the open unsolved.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.072
Murdered in June of 1980.

23:59.107 --> 24:00.491
Her husband was
a prime suspect--

24:00.525 --> 24:02.576
there was a history of abuse--
but eventually, he was cleared.

24:02.610 --> 24:05.112
Does it look like our guy?

24:05.146 --> 24:07.080
The injuries are consistent
with our other victims.

24:07.115 --> 24:08.866
However, there was
blunt force trauma postmortem.

24:08.917 --> 24:10.951
Also, there was
no ropes, no bags,

24:10.985 --> 24:13.120
but there were ligature marks.

24:13.154 --> 24:15.289
All right, that does not
match our other victims.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.323
MAX:
Well, not necessarily.

24:16.341 --> 24:17.791
If we are indeed looking

24:17.825 --> 24:19.927
at the Trashman's first victim,
it's quite possible

24:19.961 --> 24:21.795
he hadn't perfected
his method yet.

24:21.829 --> 24:23.330
Okay, maybe he made a mistake,

24:23.348 --> 24:25.799
and we can link him
to our new victim.

24:25.833 --> 24:28.769
Well, perhaps Jennifer Ravich
was close to the killer.

24:28.803 --> 24:30.437
Serial killers

24:30.472 --> 24:32.005
often choose someone
who they're close to

24:32.023 --> 24:33.440
as their first victim.

24:33.475 --> 24:35.392
All right, well, we have
the Trashman's first victim,

24:35.443 --> 24:36.560
Jennifer Ravich,
and the last one,

24:36.611 --> 24:37.945
Angela O'Hara,
so what jumps out?

24:37.979 --> 24:40.230
Okay, so, Angela was abducted
from the North Shore,

24:40.281 --> 24:42.682
and Jennifer Ravich's body
was found in Kailua.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.284
Body found
on the road?

24:44.319 --> 24:46.370
No, her body was found
on the steps of St. Martin's.

24:46.404 --> 24:47.821
(computer chirps)

24:47.855 --> 24:50.407
St. Martin's?

24:50.458 --> 24:54.361
That's where my mother
left me when I was a baby.

24:54.379 --> 24:55.462
Your mother, Max?

24:55.497 --> 24:56.914
My biological mother.

24:56.965 --> 24:58.698
As you know,
Bergman is my adopted name.

24:58.716 --> 24:59.833
Oh. That's good to know.

24:59.867 --> 25:01.835
What does that have to do
with the case?

25:09.060 --> 25:11.178
(beeps)

25:13.898 --> 25:16.483
This is Michiyo Takeshita.

25:18.486 --> 25:20.153
It's my biological mother,

25:20.188 --> 25:22.472
the Trashman's second victim.

25:35.692 --> 25:36.700
CHIN:
<i>How long have you known</i>

25:36.701 --> 25:38.836
that your mother was one
of the Trashman's victims?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.387
A while.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.757
I've never talked
to anyone about it.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.326
It is, as you can imagine,

25:46.344 --> 25:48.262
quite difficult for me.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.714
She was an
unwed mother

25:50.765 --> 25:53.133
who didn't know what to do.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.302
Did you ever get
to meet her?

25:55.336 --> 25:57.304
No.

25:57.338 --> 25:58.739
I never knew her.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.643
She was already dead
when I discovered her name.

26:02.677 --> 26:05.512
That's why you went
to go see Richard Branch.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.481
Yes.

26:07.515 --> 26:10.768
I wanted to meet the man
who killed my mother.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.856
But then,
I heard his story, and..

26:15.874 --> 26:18.709
and I looked into the case,
and I realized that

26:18.743 --> 26:20.377
he couldn't
have done it.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.045
CHIN:
Okay, so,

26:22.080 --> 26:24.197
the real question here is,
what does your mother

26:24.215 --> 26:25.749
have in common
with the other victims?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.218
That I don't know.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.370
I studied each case
over and over again,

26:30.405 --> 26:32.005
but I failed
to come up

26:32.039 --> 26:34.425
with a viable theory as to how
he chooses his victims.

26:34.476 --> 26:36.093
There's got to be something
else. There has got to be

26:36.144 --> 26:37.644
a pattern that
we are not seeing. What is it?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.730
Okay, so, Jennifer Ravich
was killed and left

26:39.764 --> 26:41.398
on the steps of St. Martin's,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.317
and you were left there
for adoption.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.937
Why St. Martin's? Do you know
why she left you there?

26:46.988 --> 26:49.823
St. Martin's was
a well-known safe haven

26:49.858 --> 26:51.241
for unwanted children.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.577
Did Jennifer Ravich
have children?

26:53.611 --> 26:56.613
No. No next of kin listed.

26:56.664 --> 26:58.916
Yeah, Angela O'Hara didn't have
children, either.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.168
Hold-hold on a minute.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.871
May-may I see Jennifer Ravich's
autopsy report?

27:03.905 --> 27:07.291
(computer chirps)

27:07.342 --> 27:09.743
Autopsy shows evidence of
full-term delivery of a child.

27:09.761 --> 27:12.179
What about Angela O'Hara's
autopsy?

27:12.213 --> 27:14.548
She also had pelvic separation.
DANNY: No, no, no.

27:14.582 --> 27:16.800
I was at her place.
There was no signs of a kid.

27:16.851 --> 27:19.586
No, there wouldn't be...
if she gave the child up.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.087
I'll go check it out.

27:40.575 --> 27:44.044
Got something?
Yeah.

27:44.078 --> 27:46.997
Hey. Okay, so, I just spoke
to the victim's mother,

27:47.048 --> 27:50.050
and I found out that Angela
had a child out of wedlock,

27:50.084 --> 27:51.785
and she hid it from her mom.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.971
Okay, uh, any connection
to St. Martin's?

27:54.005 --> 27:55.455
Yeah, she was a
parishioner there.

27:55.473 --> 27:56.289
Oh.

27:56.307 --> 27:57.341
All right, okay.

27:57.392 --> 27:58.509
Uh, so, let's
just assume

27:58.560 --> 27:59.843
she abandons her kid
at the church,

27:59.894 --> 28:01.461
uh, she's trying
to put it behind her.

28:01.479 --> 28:02.563
Help me, please.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.515
Wait a minute.
What about the other victims?

28:04.566 --> 28:06.600
Yeah, I spoke to
their family members,

28:06.634 --> 28:08.902
and I found out that at least
three of the victims

28:08.937 --> 28:10.571
had children that they abandoned
at St. Martin's.

28:10.605 --> 28:11.939
That's it.

28:11.973 --> 28:13.240
That's got to be it.
That's his trigger.

28:13.274 --> 28:14.441
He's targeting women

28:14.475 --> 28:15.692
that abandoned their children
at St. Martin's.

28:15.743 --> 28:17.578
Either this guy works there,
or has a connection.

28:17.612 --> 28:18.946
Let's go.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.285
MAN:
<i>St. Martin's has always been</i>

28:25.319 --> 28:29.289
a sanctuary for the children
of unwed mothers.

28:29.323 --> 28:32.626
Okay, uh, how often
are babies left here?

28:32.660 --> 28:33.827
More often than you think.

28:33.845 --> 28:37.014
May I ask what this is about?

28:37.048 --> 28:39.132
Yeah, absolutely.
Angela O'Hara.

28:39.166 --> 28:41.668
We have reason to believe
that she left her baby here.

28:43.688 --> 28:44.888
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry,

28:44.939 --> 28:46.857
but we have a very strict
privacy policy.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.109
We don't even keep records.

28:49.143 --> 28:51.678
These women have
nowhere else to turn.

28:51.696 --> 28:54.514
The-the women
who make the decision

28:54.532 --> 28:56.783
to leave a child with us
are under enormous stress.

28:56.818 --> 28:59.686
We understand, but this woman
was abducted and killed.

28:59.704 --> 29:01.788
She...

29:03.691 --> 29:05.659
I am sorry.

29:05.693 --> 29:08.495
How-how can I help?

29:08.529 --> 29:10.747
Uh, like I said,
we need you to tell us

29:10.798 --> 29:12.132
if she left a baby here.

29:12.166 --> 29:14.051
MAN:
As I've-I've told you,

29:14.085 --> 29:15.168
I-I don't know.

29:15.202 --> 29:16.303
Okay, well, maybe

29:16.337 --> 29:17.971
you can tell us
how it works then?

29:18.006 --> 29:22.509
Someone rings the bell
at the side door, and

29:22.543 --> 29:24.595
Frank Pollard, our caretaker,
usually answers.

29:24.646 --> 29:26.046
He's on the property full-time.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.898
How long has
Pollard worked here?

29:27.932 --> 29:29.516
Since before I arrived here.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.469
At least 30 years.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.990
You... You don't think that...?

29:37.025 --> 29:38.391
We need to see him right away.

29:38.409 --> 29:40.110
Yes, of course.

29:40.161 --> 29:43.246
Sam? Uh,

29:43.281 --> 29:45.565
my assistant Sam
will take you to him.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.734
Could you take these gentlemen
to find Frank, please?

29:47.752 --> 29:49.069
Of course.

29:56.511 --> 29:58.261
It's-it's about
those girls, isn't it?

29:58.296 --> 30:01.098
Just take us to him.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.600
I believe
that he's in his office.

30:08.556 --> 30:11.141
Of course it's in the basement.

30:11.192 --> 30:14.561
Yeah. We don't
go down here much.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.863
Can't imagine
why not.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.032
It's this way.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.117
Really nice.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.451
SAM:
Hey, Frank?

30:21.486 --> 30:23.603
Frank?

30:25.540 --> 30:27.774
Frank?

30:39.470 --> 30:41.621
What's up?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.758
Do you see what I see?

30:44.792 --> 30:46.760
Yes. Church people
are creepy.

30:46.794 --> 30:48.345
Those blades.

30:48.396 --> 30:50.180
They're just like the ones
I pulled out

30:50.231 --> 30:51.565
of Angela
O'Hara's tires.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.934
That's odd.
I-I thought he was down here.

30:53.968 --> 30:55.635
Where else would
this guy be?

30:55.653 --> 30:56.770
Hey, Frank?!

30:56.804 --> 30:59.773
Hey, hands up.
Five-O. Hands up.

30:59.807 --> 31:02.693
Step away from the truck and put
your hands behind your back now.

31:02.744 --> 31:04.745
Now. Hands behind
your back.

31:04.779 --> 31:05.946
What's this about?

31:05.980 --> 31:07.364
Hands behind
your back!

31:07.415 --> 31:09.983
You're under arrest
for the murder of Angela O'Hara.

31:15.506 --> 31:17.791
They got him.

31:22.764 --> 31:23.729
Max?

31:23.754 --> 31:25.549
Did they find anything to
tie him to the murders?

31:25.550 --> 31:28.435
KONO: Yeah, the razor blades in
his office match the ones

31:28.469 --> 31:29.770
we pulled out
of Angela O'Hara's tires.

31:31.773 --> 31:33.940
Fong's processing
the truck, too.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.449
Max, are you okay?

31:42.483 --> 31:44.517
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.369
DANNY:
<i>Let's do this again.</i>

31:46.404 --> 31:50.323
<i>Jennifer Ravich, Sarah Cho,</i>

31:50.357 --> 31:53.526
Michiyo Takeshita,
Marcia Long, Rachel Wilkinson,

31:53.544 --> 31:55.879
Diane Gallo
and Angela O'Hara.

31:55.913 --> 31:57.547
All victims

31:57.582 --> 31:58.915
of the Trashman.

31:58.966 --> 32:00.801
That your thing,
isn't it, Frank?

32:00.835 --> 32:02.552
Killing women who leave
their children at the church.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.537
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.039
DANNY:
We got the ropes,

32:06.057 --> 32:08.141
we got the razorblades, Frank.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.810
Why would I kill those women?

32:09.844 --> 32:11.011
I don't know. Maybe 'cause

32:11.045 --> 32:12.545
you were the one
found the children.

32:13.314 --> 32:15.315
I want you to
look at this.

32:15.349 --> 32:17.984
This is Angela O'Hara.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.654
Okay? You abducted and killed
this woman last night,

32:20.688 --> 32:22.222
and you dumped her body
in a pineapple field.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.357
That's impossible!
I already told you.

32:24.391 --> 32:26.576
I was visiting my mother
in the hospital.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.528
CHIN: That's the wrong
answer, Frank.

32:28.562 --> 32:30.030
We already found her blood
in your truck.

32:30.064 --> 32:32.449
That's not my truck.
It's the church's.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.201
(buzzer sounds)

32:35.787 --> 32:38.338
His alibi checks out.
What the hell is going on?

32:38.372 --> 32:40.507
He was at the hospital while
his mother was having dialysis

32:40.541 --> 32:42.575
when Angela O'Hara was abducted.

32:42.593 --> 32:45.378
(sighs)

32:45.412 --> 32:48.048
Who else has access
to that truck?

32:48.082 --> 32:49.966
Sam. He keeps the keys
in his office.

32:50.017 --> 32:51.668
He's Deacon MacKenna's
assistant.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.005
Guys, get over to
that church right away.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.813
They already arrested
Frank Pollard.

33:02.864 --> 33:03.897
I am aware of that.

33:03.931 --> 33:04.898
Was it true

33:04.932 --> 33:06.733
that he's the Trashman?

33:06.767 --> 33:09.736
I'm not at liberty
to say.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.771
Is there, is there
some kind of problem, though?

33:11.789 --> 33:12.772
No.

33:12.790 --> 33:13.874
Uh, not at all.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.326
I, I just need to see
something for myself.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.779
Oh.

33:24.418 --> 33:26.536
Here it is.

33:39.901 --> 33:42.035
Did Pollard have arthritis?

33:43.271 --> 33:45.238
Yes, he did.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.407
His hands had it pretty bad.

33:51.445 --> 33:53.230
Is something wrong?

33:54.115 --> 33:56.199
I don't think he did this.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.318
The intricate knots

33:58.336 --> 34:00.503
would be impossible
with arthritis.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.209
Mr. Sherman?

34:16.469 --> 34:18.638
Mr. Sherman?
(clattering)

34:38.527 --> 34:40.679
(Max groans)

35:04.387 --> 35:06.338
Why did you come back?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.540
It's you.

35:08.558 --> 35:10.726
You're the Trashman.

35:12.896 --> 35:15.314
Why did you kill
all those women?

35:15.348 --> 35:17.399
You of all people
should know, Max.

35:17.433 --> 35:18.550
They threw us away,

35:18.568 --> 35:21.503
left us on some doorstep
like a piece of trash.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.557
Jennifer Ravich--

35:25.592 --> 35:28.577
your first victim...

35:28.611 --> 35:30.061
she was your mother,
wasn't she?

35:30.079 --> 35:31.563
She wasn't my mother.

35:31.581 --> 35:32.698
I grew up without one.

35:32.732 --> 35:35.534
Was passed along from
one horrible and abusive

35:35.568 --> 35:37.569
foster home to another,
like they were doing me

35:37.587 --> 35:40.372
a big favor.

35:44.761 --> 35:49.214
You know how that feels,
Max, don't you?

35:49.248 --> 35:51.700
You don't know
anything about me.

35:52.602 --> 35:54.586
I know more than you think.

35:54.604 --> 35:56.889
I was here

35:56.923 --> 35:59.808
the day that you were
dropped off by your mother,

35:59.859 --> 36:01.193
your real mother.

36:02.946 --> 36:05.714
Such a pretty girl.

36:06.649 --> 36:09.618
She was scared,
she had no other choice.

36:09.652 --> 36:11.403
They all say that.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.205
They want to get on
with their lives,

36:13.239 --> 36:15.374
they want to pretend
it never happened,

36:15.408 --> 36:18.877
throw us away so they can get on
with their lives.

36:18.912 --> 36:20.629
You didn't know her!

36:24.968 --> 36:27.803
Did you know she came back?

36:30.289 --> 36:32.257
You're lying.

36:32.291 --> 36:35.811
Oh, no, Max, she
came back years

36:35.845 --> 36:37.796
after she abandoned you.

36:37.814 --> 36:40.933
Wanted to know what happened
to you, where you were.

36:40.967 --> 36:43.018
Said she had her life together.

36:43.069 --> 36:44.519
She wanted

36:44.571 --> 36:46.972
to find you, Max!

36:48.358 --> 36:50.308
She did?

36:50.326 --> 36:52.661
And that's how I found her.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.665
She shouldn't
have come back...

36:56.699 --> 36:59.117
just like you shouldn't
have come back.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.015
(tires screeching)

37:19.439 --> 37:22.474
That's Max's car.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.676
What's he doing here?

37:26.696 --> 37:28.814
MacKENNA:
<i>She didn't</i>

37:28.848 --> 37:30.782
want you, Max.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.534
Don't you understand that?

37:34.787 --> 37:36.905

37:39.909 --> 37:42.210
No, I'm not.

You are mentally ill.

No.

No sign of the deacon
or Sam either.
