01:33.183 --> 01:34.884
No wallet, no I.D.

01:34.918 --> 01:37.920
Dead maybe 10 hours, unless
Dr. Morales says differently.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.023
- Print scan?
- No.

01:40.419 --> 01:41.920
Sykes called missing persons.

01:41.954 --> 01:43.488
Too early to tell.

01:45.424 --> 01:47.021
What are these marks on his wrists?

01:47.141 --> 01:49.261
Rope burns. He was tied up.

01:49.296 --> 01:50.697
Torture?

01:50.731 --> 01:53.200
I wouldn't rule it out, but again... 

01:53.234 --> 01:54.735
I know... wait for Morales.

01:54.769 --> 01:57.205
I don't like this.

01:57.239 --> 01:59.741
I don't like this at all.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.487
I just spoke to the property manager.

02:09.554 --> 02:10.788
He said the drum in which
the victim was sealed

02:10.823 --> 02:11.790
isn't one of his.

02:11.824 --> 02:13.291
It looks too new.

02:13.326 --> 02:14.726
Plus, his bill of lading was for 38 drums.

02:14.761 --> 02:16.628
That one makes 39.

02:16.663 --> 02:18.565
This entire property is surrounded

02:18.599 --> 02:20.366
by chain-link fence with razor wire.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.803
If it's not one of his barrels,
then how did it get here?

02:22.838 --> 02:24.438
I asked him that, sir.

02:24.473 --> 02:25.973
He said that there's a
service gate in the back

02:26.008 --> 02:27.642
that's kept unlocked
for late-night drop-offs,

02:27.677 --> 02:28.644
things like that.

02:28.678 --> 02:30.312
Or things like this.

02:30.347 --> 02:32.448
If the contents of these
drums were gonna be recycled,

02:32.483 --> 02:33.784
then whoever did this had to know

02:34.452 --> 02:36.754
that the body would be found fairly soon.

02:36.788 --> 02:38.523
No. No, all these drums
are hazardous material

02:38.590 --> 02:40.825
people bring in thinking it's recyclable,

02:40.860 --> 02:42.260
and which they end up paying the owner

02:42.295 --> 02:44.829
to ship to a landfill up north.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.498
Kill a guy, put him in a barrel

02:46.533 --> 02:48.601
that's gonna be buried
for a thousand years?

02:48.636 --> 02:50.503
Not a bad way to dispose of a body.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.872
Or lots of bodies.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.507
Damn it!

02:53.541 --> 02:55.309
All right.

02:55.343 --> 02:59.648
Sykes, call up a few patrol
officers, get some Hazmat suits.

02:59.682 --> 03:02.351
Ask the fire department to come over,

03:02.385 --> 03:05.622
and then I want you to open each
and every one of these barrels.

03:05.656 --> 03:07.324
We could have some other victims.

03:11.730 --> 03:12.864
So, what are you thinking?

03:12.898 --> 03:14.299
Mass murderer or serial killer?

03:14.333 --> 03:15.801
I'm thinking about what might be buried

03:15.835 --> 03:18.403
in that landfill up north.

03:18.471 --> 03:20.372
All right, uh, go with the victim.

03:20.406 --> 03:22.040
Meet Raydor at the morgue.

03:22.075 --> 03:26.546
And try to get an I.D. on the
young man as soon as you can.

03:29.384 --> 03:32.052
I have a sick feeling about this.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.329
Good morning to you, too, Captain.

03:40.363 --> 03:42.999
We have a serious problem.

03:43.033 --> 03:45.735
Seven broken ribs, cracked sternum,

03:45.770 --> 03:47.771
shattered left clavicle...

03:47.838 --> 03:49.906
dislocated jaw.

03:49.941 --> 03:53.878
But the death was a result
of the rifle shot in his back.

03:53.912 --> 03:55.013
Signs of sexual abuse?

03:55.047 --> 03:56.714
I can't rule it out,

03:56.749 --> 04:00.085
but inside the bullet
wound are cotton fibers,

04:00.119 --> 04:03.855
so the victim wasn't
completely naked when he died.

04:03.890 --> 04:05.090
I see residue around his mouth.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.059
Duct tape.

04:07.093 --> 04:09.728
And the rope-burn patterns on his wrists

04:09.763 --> 04:12.801
indicate that his hands
were bound behind his back.

04:12.869 --> 04:15.538
He was being held hostage and he escaped.

04:15.573 --> 04:17.072
Doesn't look like he escaped to me.

04:17.108 --> 04:22.412
But, yes, he was probably hit
while on the run from this...

04:22.447 --> 04:24.782
a .223 rifle round.

04:24.816 --> 04:27.952
From over a hundred yards away,
wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?

04:27.986 --> 04:30.021
Otherwise, the bullet would
have gone straight through.

04:30.055 --> 04:31.622
Oh. Kid makes a break for it

04:31.656 --> 04:33.490
with his hands tied behind his back,

04:33.558 --> 04:36.460
killer fires at him with a rifle
from a pretty good distance.

04:36.495 --> 04:39.064
Bullet enters his back,
and the kid goes down.

04:39.098 --> 04:40.766
And without his hands to break his fall,

04:40.801 --> 04:42.535
his upper torso and face take the impact,

04:42.570 --> 04:46.006
thus the broken bones and lacerations.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.808
But no I.D.

04:47.842 --> 04:50.811
What... what about his fraternity brothers?

04:50.845 --> 04:52.513
How do you know he was in a fraternity?

04:52.581 --> 04:54.616
Uh, this tattoo.

04:54.650 --> 04:55.884
It's a fraternity symbol.

04:55.919 --> 04:57.820
I see them on lots of young men his age.

04:57.854 --> 04:59.455
This one's from Beta Kappa.

04:59.489 --> 05:00.956
Done fairly recently.

05:00.991 --> 05:02.791
Hmm. Could this be a hazing death?

05:02.826 --> 05:06.161
Hazing is for students trying
to get into a fraternity,

05:06.195 --> 05:09.497
not for students who are already members.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.669
His poor mother.

05:13.703 --> 05:16.204
I cannot imagine.

05:16.239 --> 05:19.708
So maybe there's a frat boy
who can identify our victim.

05:19.742 --> 05:22.678
We can't show a photo
of him looking like this.

05:23.913 --> 05:26.515
Give me an hour.

05:26.549 --> 05:29.117
I'll, uh...

05:29.151 --> 05:30.852
try and make him look presentable.

05:34.958 --> 05:37.793
That's Ben Barlow.

05:37.827 --> 05:40.829
Are you sure this is him?

05:40.863 --> 05:42.030
Absolutely.

05:42.064 --> 05:43.599
We've been close since he pledged.

05:43.633 --> 05:44.767
What's going on?

05:44.801 --> 05:46.101
Is Ben in some kind of trouble?

05:46.136 --> 05:47.703
'Cause he hasn't called
me back in like a week.

05:47.737 --> 05:48.970
That the last time you saw him, Mark?

05:49.005 --> 05:50.672
Um, we picked our claim rooms,

05:50.707 --> 05:52.841
and then he was gonna
meet us the next night

05:52.876 --> 05:54.743
at the Arclight, but he never showed up.

05:54.810 --> 05:56.144
What is a claim room?

05:56.178 --> 05:59.747
As graduates move out
of the fraternity house,

05:59.782 --> 06:02.751
younger members move in and
claim their rooms, right?

06:02.785 --> 06:04.786
You know a lot about fraternities.

06:04.820 --> 06:07.523
My son was in one.

06:07.557 --> 06:09.691
Well, Ben picked a sweet room,
too... his dad's, actually,

06:09.726 --> 06:12.961
which makes it kind of
weird he hasn't shown up yet.

06:12.996 --> 06:14.664
Wait.

06:14.698 --> 06:17.567
Uh, Ben's father was part
of the fraternity thing?

06:17.601 --> 06:19.235
He was president, class of '82.

06:19.269 --> 06:20.937
Made Ben a legacy.

06:21.004 --> 06:23.172
Lieutenant, I opened
the remaining 38 barrels

06:23.207 --> 06:25.541
like you asked, and, uh, no more dead guys.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.750
What the hell's going on?

06:35.852 --> 06:37.686
Did something happen to Ben?

06:43.227 --> 06:44.727
He died.

06:44.761 --> 06:47.262
That's what's wrong
with him in this picture?

06:47.297 --> 06:49.698
Is this why Ben hasn't been at school?!

06:50.900 --> 06:52.100
Yes, Mark.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.102
I'm so sorry.

06:54.136 --> 06:56.070
We picked up Ben's body earlier today.

07:02.243 --> 07:06.647
Mark, has, um, Ben fought with anyone,

07:06.714 --> 07:10.083
made any enemies, received any threats?

07:10.118 --> 07:11.852
What?

07:11.886 --> 07:14.087
No.

07:14.122 --> 07:15.723
Everybody loved Ben.

07:16.725 --> 07:19.661
He was a really good guy.

07:19.728 --> 07:20.929
Does his father know about this?

07:20.963 --> 07:22.597
'Cause when I talked to him, he d...

07:22.631 --> 07:24.566
Whoa, whoa. You spoke
to Ben's father recently?

07:24.600 --> 07:25.800
Yeah.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.001
I called their house,

07:27.069 --> 07:28.803
and he said that Ben was out of town,

07:28.837 --> 07:30.037
but he didn't say anything
about the police being involved.

07:32.741 --> 07:34.308
I got to go.

07:34.342 --> 07:35.976
Um...

07:36.011 --> 07:37.912
I have to let everyone
know what's going on here.

07:37.946 --> 07:40.314
I got to set up a memorial and...

07:40.348 --> 07:41.615
Sir, right this way.

07:41.650 --> 07:42.850
I... when did this happen?

07:42.918 --> 07:44.685
Let's go to this cubicle for a moment.

07:44.753 --> 07:46.621
God.

07:50.359 --> 07:52.660
Whoever killed your friend, Mark,

07:52.694 --> 07:55.696
was hoping that he'd stay
missing for a long time.

07:55.764 --> 07:56.998
What are you saying?

07:57.032 --> 07:58.700
That you can't tell anyone that Ben is dead

07:58.768 --> 08:00.669
and that we need your help
in finding his murderer.

08:00.703 --> 08:01.937
But I don't know anything.

08:01.971 --> 08:03.705
You know more than you think.

08:03.773 --> 08:04.973
We have to move.

08:05.007 --> 08:06.975
So this is what we're going to do.

08:07.009 --> 08:09.344
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

08:09.378 --> 08:11.012
- I, Mark Howard...
- I, Mark Howard...

08:11.046 --> 08:13.081
- ... do solemnly swear...
- ... Do solemnly swear...

08:13.115 --> 08:14.616
... to protect and to serve...

08:14.650 --> 08:15.851
... to protect and to serve...

08:15.885 --> 08:17.219
... as a citizen officer of the L.A.P.D.

08:17.253 --> 08:20.022
... as a citizen officer of the L.A.P.D.

08:20.056 --> 08:22.358
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

08:22.392 --> 08:24.994
Okay, this oath is good
for the next 24 hours.

08:25.028 --> 08:27.631
Now, I need you to sit at this desk,

08:27.665 --> 08:30.867
and I need you to write
down every single thing

08:30.902 --> 08:32.736
that you knew about Ben...

08:32.804 --> 08:35.139
what he liked, what he
hated, who his friends are,

08:35.173 --> 08:37.875
troubles that he had,
everything that you can think of.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.846
Does his family know?

08:40.880 --> 08:43.181
During the period of your
oath, you can have no contact

08:43.216 --> 08:44.850
with anyone outside the L.A.P.D.

08:44.884 --> 08:47.219
You'll be briefed on the
progress of our investigation

08:47.253 --> 08:48.921
on a need-to-know basis.

08:48.955 --> 08:50.022
Is this Ben's home address?

08:50.056 --> 08:52.691
Yeah. That's where he lived.

09:01.769 --> 09:03.669
Ben Barlow's parents are Brian and Lori.

09:03.704 --> 09:05.905
Brian has a family law
practice in Beverly Hills...

09:05.939 --> 09:07.407
lots of high-profile divorce cases.

09:07.441 --> 09:08.908
Mrs. Barlow works from home,

09:08.943 --> 09:10.443
volunteers for planned parenthood

09:10.478 --> 09:12.412
and a battered-women shelter.

09:12.446 --> 09:14.280
Other than a few parking
violations, neither has a record.

09:14.315 --> 09:15.682
Thanks, Mike.

09:15.716 --> 09:17.717
Let's regroup when we're done here.

09:19.286 --> 09:21.354
Captain, I know our first priority

09:21.388 --> 09:24.223
is to eliminate Mr. and
Mrs. Barlow as suspects,

09:24.257 --> 09:25.858
but, uh, somewhere in here,

09:25.893 --> 09:28.094
we need to notify them about their son.

09:28.129 --> 09:29.896
How would you like that handled?

09:29.930 --> 09:31.364
You take the lead, Lieutenant.

09:31.399 --> 09:33.233
I will stand by to help the parents.

09:42.209 --> 09:44.210
- Brian Barlow?
- Yes.

09:44.245 --> 09:46.913
Lieutenant Provenza, Lieutenant Flynn,

09:46.947 --> 09:49.382
Captain Raydor, L.A.P.D.

09:49.416 --> 09:51.718
Have you found them?!

09:51.752 --> 09:53.119
Tell me you found my children!

09:53.154 --> 09:55.121
The three of you have to
get out of here right now.

09:55.156 --> 09:56.456
Do you understand me? Right now.

09:56.491 --> 09:57.925
They're watching our house.

09:57.959 --> 09:58.892
They're listening to all of our phones.

09:58.927 --> 10:00.127
Who's watching your house?

10:00.161 --> 10:01.795
Did you say your children are missing?

10:01.829 --> 10:03.897
Yes. And unless you have my
son and daughter with you,

10:03.931 --> 10:05.232
I don't care why you're here.

10:05.266 --> 10:06.766
We didn't call you.

10:06.801 --> 10:08.168
And you're about to get
both of our kids killed.

10:08.235 --> 10:09.803
Listen to me, Mr. Barlow... the L.A.P.D....

10:09.837 --> 10:11.304
Here's a phone they're not listening to.

10:11.339 --> 10:14.274
I will text you a number.
Call me or I must come back.

10:14.308 --> 10:16.075
- You have to!
- I said listen to me.

10:16.110 --> 10:18.912
Gentlemen, with me please.

10:23.184 --> 10:25.298
Good God, we just walked into a kidnapping.

10:25.418 --> 10:27.988
If their daughter is still alive.

10:36.657 --> 10:38.447
Okay, it's not just a kidnapping.

10:38.655 --> 10:39.622
It's murder.

10:39.656 --> 10:40.689
We're not ignoring that.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.890
The son is dead, I know,

10:41.924 --> 10:43.125
but the daughter may still be alive,

10:43.159 --> 10:44.759
and she has to be our first priority.

10:44.794 --> 10:46.661
Lieutenant Provenza, may I use your phone?

10:46.696 --> 10:49.698
But Barlow knew his kids were
missing and never reported it.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.232
What if he got rid of them himself?

10:51.267 --> 10:53.668
We should have at least
notified him of the boy's death

10:53.703 --> 10:56.237
and then seen what kind of
reaction we got from the guy.

10:56.271 --> 10:59.073
As difficult as this is,
Lieutenant, may I remind you,

10:59.107 --> 11:02.042
the L.A.P.D. is under no legal obligation

11:02.077 --> 11:05.045
to notify anyone of any death at any time.

11:05.079 --> 11:06.646
And what if they're
telling the truth, Flynn?

11:06.680 --> 11:08.814
Unless the mother and
father are terrific actors,

11:08.848 --> 11:10.682
once they find out their son is dead...

11:10.717 --> 11:11.883
the kidnappers will
hear it in their voices.

11:11.918 --> 11:13.518
We could lose the daughter.

11:13.552 --> 11:16.787
Sykes is not just polishing
the apple this time.

11:16.822 --> 11:17.888
The Captain's got it right.

11:22.093 --> 11:23.727
This is Captain Sharon Raydor.

11:23.761 --> 11:24.894
This is Lori Barlow.

11:24.929 --> 11:26.730
Thank you for trusting me, Mrs. Barlow.

11:26.764 --> 11:28.898
We want to help you try
and get your children back.

11:28.933 --> 11:30.633
I need some information.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.936
Can you tell me when you first
heard from the kidnappers?

11:33.970 --> 11:35.671
Six days ago.

11:35.705 --> 11:38.940
They called and said we
needed to give them $100,000

11:38.975 --> 11:41.243
if we ever wanted to
see Ben and Emily again.

11:41.277 --> 11:42.978
So we paid it.

11:43.012 --> 11:46.013
And then they demanded more
money, and we paid that.

11:46.048 --> 11:48.683
Mrs. Barlow, have you
spoken to your children?

11:48.717 --> 11:50.117
My husband has.

11:50.152 --> 11:51.519
And how many payments have
you made to the kidnappers?

11:51.553 --> 11:52.720
Four.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.156
We have paid them four times...

11:55.191 --> 11:57.759
hundreds of thousands of dollars

11:57.794 --> 12:00.528
and still they just... they make us wait.

12:00.563 --> 12:03.998
They tell us to stay off the
phone and keep the line open.

12:04.033 --> 12:07.068
And I told my husband
that we cannot handle this.

12:07.103 --> 12:08.937
But he won't listen to me.

12:08.971 --> 12:11.239
I'm listening, Mrs.
Barlow, from here on out.

12:11.274 --> 12:13.675
Keep the line open, as the kidnappers say,

12:13.709 --> 12:15.677
and the next time you hear from them,

12:15.712 --> 12:17.546
you call this number immediately.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.014
Okay, okay.

12:19.049 --> 12:20.783
I... I'll call you as soon
as we hear from them again.

12:20.817 --> 12:22.952
Captain, permission to wire-tap.

12:22.986 --> 12:24.787
Mrs. Barlow, I need your permission

12:24.821 --> 12:26.655
to attach a wire-tap to your phones.

12:26.723 --> 12:27.923
Of course.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.091
Just...

12:29.125 --> 12:31.727
promise you'll find my children.

12:35.665 --> 12:38.200
We will, Mrs. Barlow.

12:38.234 --> 12:39.768
We will.

12:39.803 --> 12:41.770
Lori? What are you doing in there?

12:41.804 --> 12:44.573
Uh, I... I'll be out in just a minute.

12:44.607 --> 12:45.641
I have to go.

12:48.077 --> 12:50.579
Okay, I'll get a wire started.

12:50.613 --> 12:52.715
Detective Sanchez, four ransom drops.

12:52.749 --> 12:54.650
I'll get a warrant for all
their bank accounts, ma'am.

12:54.684 --> 12:56.918
Mike, uh, you said that Barlow

12:56.953 --> 12:58.587
practiced family law?

12:58.621 --> 13:00.857
I'll call D.D.A. Hobbs,
get access to his cases

13:00.924 --> 13:02.692
going back... four years?

13:02.726 --> 13:05.330
At least. In divorces and custody fights,

13:05.364 --> 13:08.267
sometimes people hold
grudges for a long time.

13:08.301 --> 13:12.170
And, Mike, if you will, see
if we can obtain the passwords

13:12.205 --> 13:14.139
for Emily and Ben's Facebook accounts.

13:14.173 --> 13:15.673
Will do.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.677
Captain, if I may, S.I.S.
has a lot of experience

13:18.711 --> 13:20.011
in kidnapping cases.

13:20.046 --> 13:22.180
So, in my humble opinion,
this might  be a good place

13:22.214 --> 13:24.282
for Sykes to take the lead.

13:24.317 --> 13:26.918
If Mr. Barlow is preparing
to make another drop...

13:26.952 --> 13:28.153
Let's put eyes on him.

13:28.187 --> 13:29.788
What sort of eyes?

13:29.822 --> 13:31.723
There we are.

13:31.758 --> 13:33.125
All right, it's up.

13:33.159 --> 13:34.827
I think that's the Barlow
residence right there.

13:34.861 --> 13:36.762
Yeah, from about 2,600 feet in the air.

13:36.796 --> 13:38.230
Good eye, Lieutenant.

13:39.732 --> 13:41.300
We can take the drone higher or lower

13:41.334 --> 13:43.235
if the scope size seems good.

13:43.269 --> 13:44.670
I think it's about right.

13:44.704 --> 13:46.772
Any closer and we'll lose the peripherals.

13:46.807 --> 13:49.208
Half a mile's on the low
end of not being noticeable.

13:49.243 --> 13:52.679
Hmm. I can't believe that this is all live.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.180
Isn't it great?

13:54.215 --> 13:56.716
Must look really different to you, huh?

13:56.750 --> 13:58.251
Back when you were doing surveillance,

13:58.318 --> 14:00.653
we needed multiple teams
of detectives on the ground

14:00.687 --> 14:02.955
to cover God only knows how
many square miles of terrain.

14:02.990 --> 14:05.658
Big change from the blimp and
telescope you trained with,

14:05.692 --> 14:06.792
isn't it, sir?

14:06.827 --> 14:09.061
Now we can follow people everywhere.

14:09.096 --> 14:11.330
Yeah, as long as they don't look up.

14:11.364 --> 14:13.031
Just got confirmation.

14:13.066 --> 14:16.267
Wire-tap's been approved,
and it should be functional.

14:16.335 --> 14:19.371
Now all we need is for someone to call.

14:21.107 --> 14:23.375
These are Emily's last
few Facebook postings.

14:23.409 --> 14:25.411
This next-to-last one... very interesting.

14:25.445 --> 14:27.747
"Dad's office set up a secret photo session

14:27.781 --> 14:29.081
for my brother and me

14:29.116 --> 14:30.850
for an anniversary present for my parents.

14:30.884 --> 14:32.285
So fun."

14:32.319 --> 14:34.687
This was posted on Emily
Barlow's Facebook account

14:34.722 --> 14:36.723
the day she and her brother went missing.

14:36.757 --> 14:37.958
I called her dad's office.

14:37.992 --> 14:39.359
They didn't know anything about it.

14:39.394 --> 14:41.362
So this could have been
how the kidnappers arranged

14:41.396 --> 14:42.930
to grab both children at once,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.966
and they knew the Barlows
had an anniversary.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.267
More than that, the kidnappers knew

14:46.302 --> 14:47.435
how to get in touch with each of the kids.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.769
They knew where the father worked.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.771
That's a lot of personal information,

14:50.805 --> 14:52.306
so it had to be someone
close to the family.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.440
Yeah, really close.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.942
Barlow's credit report, ma'am.

14:54.976 --> 14:56.410
Our victim's father

14:56.444 --> 14:58.278
cashed in about a million
dollars' worth of stock

14:58.313 --> 14:59.880
held jointly with his wife.

14:59.914 --> 15:01.281
He also emptied all of his bank accounts.

15:01.316 --> 15:03.417
Possibly collecting funds
for the ransom drops?

15:03.451 --> 15:05.953
Or possibly not. I also
pulled the entire family's

15:05.987 --> 15:07.721
credit-card statements
for the last three months,

15:07.756 --> 15:10.457
and one of Mr. Barlow's cards
had some strange charges.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.059
Such as?

15:12.093 --> 15:14.261
Two black 55-gallon drums
purchased 3 weeks ago

15:14.295 --> 15:15.796
from stores in Sun Valley.

15:15.830 --> 15:18.398
Plus a case of prepaid cellphones.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.300
The guy's a divorce attorney.

15:20.334 --> 15:22.069
If he's leaving his wife,

15:22.103 --> 15:23.837
he knows he can't hide money from her,

15:23.905 --> 15:25.472
so collecting his own ransom
payments gets him all their cash

15:25.507 --> 15:27.274
and he can do whatever he wants with it.

15:27.308 --> 15:28.876
Plus, he didn't call the police,

15:28.910 --> 15:30.077
and he sounds like a control freak.

15:30.111 --> 15:32.446
But killing both of his children?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.417
Though we have seen worse,

15:36.451 --> 15:39.153
and he was very serious
about us not interfering.

15:39.187 --> 15:40.955
And the two containers indicate

15:40.989 --> 15:42.890
that someone was thinking about
how to get rid of the bodies

15:42.924 --> 15:44.291
before the kidnapping.

15:44.326 --> 15:46.394
You know, I think we
have to pick up Barlow.

15:46.428 --> 15:48.496
You want to wait for the court
records? They'll be here any minute.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.865
Lieutenant, I don't think
Emily Barlow has a minute.

15:50.899 --> 15:53.234
We have two 55-gallon drums,

15:53.268 --> 15:55.770
Mrs. Barlow is talking
about kidnappers, plural.

15:55.804 --> 15:57.939
If this father was involved,

15:57.973 --> 16:00.207
he is definitely not doing this alone.

16:00.275 --> 16:02.243
Captain, incoming call.

16:05.146 --> 16:07.114
I'm not delivering this money

16:07.149 --> 16:08.516
unless you let me talk to my children.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.384
You don't make the demands here.

16:10.419 --> 16:13.821
I refuse to continue unless
I can talk to my kids.

16:14.923 --> 16:15.957
Fine. Hold on.

16:18.026 --> 16:19.260
Daddy?

16:19.294 --> 16:21.195
Emily, is that you?

16:21.229 --> 16:22.396
Daddy! Help me!

16:22.430 --> 16:23.497
Help me!

16:23.531 --> 16:25.966
Emily, are you and Ben okay?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.001
Emily?

16:28.870 --> 16:30.204
Emily?!

16:30.238 --> 16:32.206
- Are you satisfied?
- I want to talk to my son.

16:33.108 --> 16:35.376
- I'll get back to you. Stay where you are.
- No, just...

16:35.410 --> 16:37.445
Don't call the police.
This'll be the last drop.

16:37.479 --> 16:39.513
If y... 

16:42.985 --> 16:44.385
Got a 661 number.

16:44.419 --> 16:46.354
No GPS signal. Can't be traced.

16:46.388 --> 16:49.357
661... that's the area code
on the prepaid cellphones

16:49.391 --> 16:51.592
purchased with Mr.
Barlow's credit card, ma'am.

16:51.627 --> 16:54.095
At least we know the girl's still alive.

16:54.129 --> 16:55.864
But for how long?

16:55.898 --> 16:57.932
As soon as the last of
the ransom is delivered,

16:57.967 --> 16:59.834
Emily's as good as dead.

17:04.039 --> 17:06.574
Mrs. Barlow, this is Captain Raydor.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.276
You need to stay out of this!

17:08.343 --> 17:10.411
If you or the FBI show
up or have anything to...

17:10.444 --> 17:12.046
Don't worry, sir.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.381
The FBI doesn't get involved
in our kidnapping cases

17:13.415 --> 17:15.016
unless we ask them to.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.050
You've been talking to my
wife after I told you not to.

17:17.085 --> 17:19.053
Mr. Barlow, dealing with
kidnappings on your own

17:19.087 --> 17:20.253
is extremely dangerous.

17:20.288 --> 17:21.988
And what do you think these people will do

17:22.022 --> 17:24.223
if they find out I have
been talking to you?

17:24.258 --> 17:26.492
"These people." Sir, who are these people?

17:26.527 --> 17:29.195
You are endangering the
lives of my children!

17:29.230 --> 17:32.298
Mr. Barlow, wait!

17:33.538 --> 17:34.939
Anyone else getting the feeling

17:34.973 --> 17:36.941
Mr. Barlow knows who the kidnappers are?

17:36.975 --> 17:38.009
Should we pick him up?

17:38.043 --> 17:39.340
Or do we follow him?

17:39.460 --> 17:40.467
Neither.

17:41.024 --> 17:42.847
We call D.D.A. Hobbs.

17:55.389 --> 17:56.225
No, thank you.

17:56.345 --> 17:58.290
I've got the last of
the records here with me

17:58.325 --> 18:00.259
and enough people to sort through them.

18:00.294 --> 18:01.494
Uh-huh. Yeah.

18:01.562 --> 18:03.463
Captain Raydor is...?

18:03.497 --> 18:05.598
Her office.

18:09.170 --> 18:12.973
D.D.A. Hobbs, thank you for
expediting all these records

18:13.008 --> 18:14.408
of Brian Barlow's court cases.

18:14.443 --> 18:16.444
Well, I hope they help.

18:16.478 --> 18:20.414
Meanwhile, I have some
news about Rusty Beck.

18:20.449 --> 18:21.415
Oh?

18:21.450 --> 18:23.050
As you know, Rusty's DNA

18:23.085 --> 18:25.653
ended up being in the mask
he pulled off Phillip Stroh.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.254
In our follow-up,

18:27.289 --> 18:29.456
the lab found a familial match to the boy

18:29.491 --> 18:31.125
in our criminal database.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.962
You're saying Rusty has a
relative who's a criminal?

18:36.698 --> 18:38.132
Paul Dunn.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.135
He was arrested for dealing cocaine

18:40.169 --> 18:42.170
in San Diego about six years ago.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.239
Looks like Rusty's paternal uncle.

18:44.274 --> 18:46.508
Paul has an older brother, Daniel Dunn,

18:46.542 --> 18:49.377
who, I bet, will test out
as Rusty's biological father.

18:51.113 --> 18:52.513
And I found the birth certificate,

18:52.548 --> 18:56.417
listing Sharon Beck as
Rusty's mother, father unknown.

18:56.451 --> 18:58.151
It's from a San Diego hospital.

18:58.186 --> 19:00.721
Is there any physical evidence
saying that that was...

19:07.995 --> 19:10.596
Sharon, what if I got my license

19:10.631 --> 19:13.232
so that I can drive myself home

19:13.300 --> 19:16.168
instead of being picked up
by patrol cars all the time?

19:16.202 --> 19:17.536
It just... it looks weird,

19:17.570 --> 19:19.705
my always riding off with the police.

19:19.739 --> 19:21.574
Where you gonna get this car?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.311
Okay. What... what about a bus pass, then?

19:25.345 --> 19:27.514
And who would look after
you at home when I'm at work?

19:27.548 --> 19:29.182
Oh, my God.

19:29.216 --> 19:31.083
Ordinary people leave their
children alone all the time.

19:31.151 --> 19:33.052
It's not like I'm a little kid.

19:33.087 --> 19:35.255
And isn't it illegal
for her to be asking cops

19:35.289 --> 19:36.589
to pick me up places?

19:36.624 --> 19:38.491
You're a material
witness in a murder trial.

19:38.526 --> 19:40.460
In a murder trial that never begins.

19:40.495 --> 19:44.332
Believe it or not, Rusty,
you are not the only issue

19:44.366 --> 19:49.203
the city of Los Angeles is
dealing with this afternoon.

19:49.238 --> 19:51.472
I'm assuming you have homework.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.245
They're making us read "Hamlet."

19:57.279 --> 19:59.046
That should take some time.

20:02.350 --> 20:05.253
Look, what you tell the boy is up to you.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.555
I'm not sure the father
has any legal standing.

20:07.589 --> 20:09.490
And he may know as little about Rusty

20:09.524 --> 20:10.724
as Rusty knows about him.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.131
Who are you?

20:17.166 --> 20:20.034
Um...

20:20.069 --> 20:21.436
I can't say.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.338
You can't say who you are?

20:24.540 --> 20:26.274
Rusty, this way.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.543
I'm sorry for the interruption.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.112
Who is that?

20:31.147 --> 20:33.548
He's a sworn civilian police officer.

20:33.582 --> 20:35.750
Civilians can be police officers?

20:35.785 --> 20:37.452
Really?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.454
Uh, well, y... yes.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.122
They...

20:41.156 --> 20:45.125
Man, you people lie about everything.

20:46.661 --> 20:48.462
Ma'am, the credit card that was used

20:48.496 --> 20:50.598
to buy the barrels and
the disposable phones

20:50.633 --> 20:52.767
was reported stolen by
Barlow three weeks ago.

20:52.802 --> 20:54.336
Doesn't mean that he didn't buy them,

20:54.370 --> 20:56.538
but he was in court
when they were purchased,

20:56.572 --> 20:58.406
and he's contesting the charges.

20:58.441 --> 21:01.075
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

21:01.110 --> 21:04.178
As everyone knows, I have seen
my share of divorce papers.

21:04.246 --> 21:06.180
It's true. He has.

21:06.248 --> 21:09.250
But I have never seen a filing this thin.

21:10.118 --> 21:12.152
There's just something not right.

21:12.187 --> 21:16.289
May I introduce you to one Gerald Hall?

21:23.264 --> 21:24.764
Wow.

21:24.798 --> 21:27.334
Mr. Hall didn't fill out any
of the required paperwork...

21:27.368 --> 21:29.302
not the statements, not the approvals,

21:29.336 --> 21:30.770
not even the custody papers.

21:30.805 --> 21:32.639
And when Mr. Barlow helped Susan Hall

21:32.674 --> 21:34.475
get a restraining order
against her husband,

21:34.509 --> 21:36.310
he ignored that, too.

21:36.344 --> 21:39.613
Patrol officers had to pull
him off of her property twice.

21:39.647 --> 21:42.349
But Gerald Hall didn't ignore his guns.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.352
They were impounded during
the divorce proceedings,

21:44.386 --> 21:46.220
and he fought until he
got every last one back.

21:46.288 --> 21:48.323
What sort of guns are we talking about?

21:48.357 --> 21:49.724
There were 58 of them,

21:49.792 --> 21:53.328
and 16 of them are high-powered rifles.

21:53.363 --> 21:55.297
If we're looking for
a heavily armed someone

21:55.332 --> 21:56.465
with a grudge...

21:56.500 --> 21:58.334
well, let me put it this way...

21:58.368 --> 22:00.235
I remember my ex-wives' attorneys

22:00.303 --> 22:02.304
far better than I do my marriages.

22:02.339 --> 22:05.341
We may be looking for two
heavily armed someones.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.309
Let's go by Mr. Hall's
house and pick him up.

22:07.344 --> 22:08.677
Problem.

22:08.712 --> 22:10.546
No current address, phone number, either.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.182
Well, we may not have an
address for the husband,

22:13.216 --> 22:14.850
but we have one for the ex-wife.

22:22.858 --> 22:26.827
Susan, thank you for agreeing
to come down and talk to us.

22:26.862 --> 22:28.462
Is this about Gerald?

22:28.496 --> 22:30.263
Actually, it's about Brian Barlow.

22:30.331 --> 22:31.531
Then it's about Gerald,

22:31.565 --> 22:33.233
and I'm not gonna talk badly about him

22:33.267 --> 22:34.701
in front of John and Tricia.

22:34.735 --> 22:35.902
Of course not.

22:35.936 --> 22:37.503
Lieutenant Flynn, would you mind

22:37.538 --> 22:39.405
taking Ms. Hall's
children to the break room?

22:39.439 --> 22:40.873
We'll take good care of them, ma'am.

22:40.907 --> 22:43.842
Sure. Right this way, kids.

22:43.877 --> 22:45.444
Right this way.

22:45.512 --> 22:47.880
Ma'am, let's go to our
visitor's conference center.

22:47.915 --> 22:48.881
Follow me.

22:51.285 --> 22:54.454
3 1/2 years ago, Gerald lost his job.

22:54.489 --> 22:57.424
And, uh, then we lost the house.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.725
And Gerald...

22:58.760 --> 23:00.327
Blamed you.

23:00.362 --> 23:03.397
No, he blamed the government,
but took it out on me.

23:03.432 --> 23:06.367
And after a broken wrist and a concussion,

23:06.402 --> 23:08.903
I'd had enough, so I packed up the kids,

23:08.938 --> 23:11.206
and, uh... I went to Serenity.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.674
Serenity?

23:12.708 --> 23:16.378
Serenity... it's a shelter
for wives and children

23:16.412 --> 23:20.715
of physical abusers, bullies,
whatever you want to call them.

23:20.749 --> 23:22.684
I should have left the
first time he hit me.

23:22.718 --> 23:26.754
Oh, your attorney's wife works
with domestic-abuse issues.

23:26.788 --> 23:28.622
So Serenity's the women's shelter

23:28.656 --> 23:30.391
where you met Lori Barlow?

23:30.425 --> 23:33.961
Yeah. She's a counselor there
and a great friend, and she's...

23:33.995 --> 23:36.897
she helped me accept what I needed to do.

23:36.931 --> 23:40.267
She asked her husband to
take my case... pro bono,

23:40.301 --> 23:41.635
which... that means for free.

23:41.669 --> 23:44.504
I never could have afforded it otherwise.

23:44.538 --> 23:47.741
Seven months later, I was divorced.

23:47.775 --> 23:48.842
Still am...

23:48.910 --> 23:51.411
no matter what Gerald says.

23:52.647 --> 23:54.581
Yes. We saw in the court files

23:54.615 --> 23:56.816
he refused to concede to the decree.

23:56.851 --> 23:59.653
It's because Gerald considers
himself a sovereign citizen.

23:59.687 --> 24:01.488
Well, that's not good.

24:01.522 --> 24:04.291
Sovereign citizen... is
that some sort of militia?

24:04.325 --> 24:06.660
Worse. They're a radical
anti-government group.

24:06.694 --> 24:08.763
They disregard laws, don't pay taxes...

24:08.797 --> 24:10.564
don't even stop for red lights.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.900
Big player in black-market guns, too.

24:12.935 --> 24:15.036
And when he started
spouting all that stuff,

24:15.070 --> 24:18.272
I didn't want my kids infected
with that kind of talk.

24:18.307 --> 24:22.310
Do you know where your
ex-husband is right now, Susan?

24:22.344 --> 24:24.513
Is that what this is all about?

24:24.547 --> 24:27.682
Look, I know Gerald's not
supposed to come around

24:27.717 --> 24:30.752
and that I'm supposed
to report it if he does.

24:31.955 --> 24:33.289
Have you seen him lately?

24:33.323 --> 24:35.324
Yesterday morning.

24:35.359 --> 24:37.860
It was after the kids went to school.

24:37.895 --> 24:40.897
Gerald came by the apartment, and, uh...

24:40.931 --> 24:45.567
and he gave me $20,000 in cash.

24:45.602 --> 24:46.735
What was the money for?

24:46.770 --> 24:48.570
Two years' back child support.

24:48.605 --> 24:50.739
He said he wanted to start

24:50.773 --> 24:52.654
spending time with the kids now and then...

24:53.059 --> 24:56.344
like, take them to a movie
tonight, if I'd let him.

24:56.378 --> 24:59.013
Gives his wife $20,000 in cash
so she lets her guard down.

24:59.048 --> 25:01.811
And then he drives off with their kids.

25:01.931 --> 25:05.487
Sir, we need to keep Mrs. Hall
and her children here with us.

25:05.521 --> 25:07.422
Maybe, uh, put some people around her house

25:07.457 --> 25:09.217
in case Gerald stops by again.

25:09.337 --> 25:10.593
I don't know what to believe.

25:10.627 --> 25:12.862
Where do you suppose your ex-husband

25:12.896 --> 25:14.731
got $20,000 in cash?

25:14.765 --> 25:16.499
I don't know.

25:16.534 --> 25:18.534
To be honest, I always thought,

25:18.569 --> 25:22.038
if he had that kind of money,
he'd just buy more guns.

25:22.073 --> 25:24.507
Maybe he decided 58 was enough.

25:24.542 --> 25:26.342
58?

25:26.376 --> 25:27.644
That's how many of your husband's firearms

25:27.678 --> 25:28.778
were held during the divorce.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.932
Gerald had twice that many guns.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.416
He was buying more all the time.

25:33.450 --> 25:34.584
From where?

25:34.618 --> 25:37.223
A dealer, at a store. I don't know.

25:37.343 --> 25:39.522
- I want that dealer's name.
- Yes, sir.

25:39.557 --> 25:40.890
Where does your ex-husband live?

25:40.925 --> 25:43.760
With his father, who has a trailer.

25:43.794 --> 25:46.596
They're always moving around, so...

25:46.631 --> 25:48.465
Good luck locating him.

25:50.001 --> 25:51.769
But if you do...

25:51.803 --> 25:53.037
Yes?

25:53.071 --> 25:54.672
... please don't tell my ex-father-in-law

25:54.706 --> 25:56.707
I spoke with you.

25:56.741 --> 25:59.977
He's twice as crazy as my husband...

26:00.011 --> 26:02.079
and twice as violent, too.

26:08.953 --> 26:10.720
According to his registrations, Captain,

26:10.754 --> 26:12.788
Mr. Hall and his father
purchased all of his guns

26:12.823 --> 26:14.957
in the last three years
from a guy named Dale Fisher,

26:14.992 --> 26:16.792
who works at a place in North Hollywood

26:16.827 --> 26:18.962
called NoHo Guns and Ammo.

26:18.996 --> 26:20.831
I bet you this Dale would know
how to get in touch with him.

26:20.865 --> 26:23.467
But why do they want to
buy all these weapons?

26:23.501 --> 26:26.070
Normally, I'd say to sell guns
to other sovereign citizens,

26:26.104 --> 26:27.938
but the volume and the trailer

26:27.973 --> 26:30.808
suggest they're running
guns south of the border.

26:30.843 --> 26:33.812
So he collects money from
these multiple ransom drops

26:33.846 --> 26:36.114
and uses it to order serious weapons.

26:36.149 --> 26:39.785
He can triple his investment
by reselling firearms in Mexico.

26:39.819 --> 26:42.054
But Gerald wanted to
pick up his kids tonight.

26:42.088 --> 26:44.189
And he also has another ransom arranged...

26:44.224 --> 26:45.491
the last, he says.

26:45.525 --> 26:46.925
Obviously, we're at the endgame.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.694
My humble opinion... as I've said before,

26:48.728 --> 26:50.762
S.I.S. handles most of
our kidnapping cases.

26:50.797 --> 26:51.930
That means Sykes.

26:51.965 --> 26:53.565
Julio here is our weapons guy.

26:53.599 --> 26:55.100
I'd send them both to the gun shop,

26:55.134 --> 26:57.069
force Fisher to call Gerald and his father,

26:57.103 --> 26:58.904
and get them to come there.

26:58.938 --> 27:01.173
But what if we grab only one
of the Halls at this gun shop

27:01.207 --> 27:04.176
and the other one stays
behind with Emily Barlow?

27:04.210 --> 27:06.745
Hiding in a trailer we know not where.

27:06.779 --> 27:09.047
And they bought two 55-gallon drums.

27:09.082 --> 27:11.650
Which means they always
intended to kill both kids.

27:11.685 --> 27:13.652
So the best way to finish this

27:13.687 --> 27:15.854
would be to get Gerald
to appear at the gun shop

27:15.889 --> 27:17.456
and persuade him to help us

27:17.491 --> 27:19.025
before his father kills the girl.

27:20.928 --> 27:22.195
Persuade him how?

27:33.908 --> 27:36.743
Dale Fisher?

27:36.778 --> 27:38.145
Detective Sykes, Detective Sanchez.

27:38.179 --> 27:40.847
We'd like to ask you about Gerald Hall.

27:40.882 --> 27:42.916
Well, sure. Yeah. Good customer.

27:42.950 --> 27:44.751
You mean he buys a lot of guns?

27:44.819 --> 27:46.120
Look around, lady.

27:46.154 --> 27:47.621
I'm not a florist.

27:49.290 --> 27:52.126
Yeah. Him and his father buy a lot of guns.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.260
So... what?

27:53.295 --> 27:55.096
Is Gerald in trouble?

27:55.130 --> 27:58.065
'Cause if he is, you need
to know I just sell the guns.

27:58.099 --> 28:00.501
Everything I do is legit, I swear.

28:00.535 --> 28:01.935
Sir, don't run if you're not being chased.

28:01.969 --> 28:03.737
Has Gerald or his father

28:03.772 --> 28:05.705
purchased anything from you lately?

28:05.739 --> 28:09.608
Yeah. In fact, I got a big order for them

28:09.676 --> 28:12.144
coming in this afternoon
or tomorrow morning.

28:12.178 --> 28:13.578
Why?

28:15.948 --> 28:21.720
21 M4 semiautomatic rifles,
18 AK-47s, 28 shotguns?

28:21.754 --> 28:23.788
What do you think they're
doing with this many firearms?

28:23.823 --> 28:25.290
I don't know.

28:25.324 --> 28:27.292
And the second amendment
doesn't require me to ask.

28:27.326 --> 28:28.860
Sir, you're going to call the Halls

28:28.895 --> 28:30.262
and tell them this order has arrived.

28:30.296 --> 28:31.930
I don't work for you people.

28:31.964 --> 28:34.132
Mr. Fisher, Gerald Hall
murdered a young man

28:34.166 --> 28:36.969
and sealed him up in a 55-gallon
drum as hazardous waste.

28:37.003 --> 28:39.671
He's preparing to do that
again with a teenage girl.

28:39.706 --> 28:41.206
And he's working with someone.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.775
And this...

28:42.809 --> 28:46.012
this looks like a
partnership agreement to me.

28:46.046 --> 28:48.181
If you don't pick up the
phone and call Mr. Hall,

28:48.215 --> 28:49.582
I'm arresting you

28:49.616 --> 28:51.017
for kidnapping, torture, and murder,

28:51.051 --> 28:52.318
and I'm gonna feel great about it.

28:52.353 --> 28:56.152
Look, these people are a little crazy,

28:56.272 --> 28:57.558
and they are heavily armed.

28:57.592 --> 28:59.593
With weapons you sold them.

28:59.628 --> 29:01.562
Either pick up the phone

29:01.596 --> 29:04.131
or put your hands behind
your back and face the wall.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.330
- Captain?
- Hmm?

29:31.450 --> 29:33.679
I put Susan in the
break room with her kids.

29:33.713 --> 29:35.550
Any word from the gun store?

29:35.634 --> 29:37.851
Still waiting to see
if Gerald Hall responds

29:37.971 --> 29:39.605
to the message his dealer left him.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.406
Meanwhile, we're keeping
an eye on the Barlow house

29:41.441 --> 29:42.311
and their phones.

29:42.431 --> 29:44.476
I finished "Hamlet."

29:45.073 --> 29:47.809
So how much longer do
I have to be here today?

29:47.843 --> 29:50.645
Can you tell me what's going on or not?

29:53.582 --> 29:55.016
I, uh...

29:55.051 --> 29:58.554
I'm not exactly sure how to explain this.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.889
I already know.

30:01.725 --> 30:03.726
The guy in my cubicle said
that his friend was murdered.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.063
Seems pretty broken up about it.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.331
Is that true?

30:08.365 --> 30:09.932
Yes.

30:09.967 --> 30:12.836
His friend and his friend's
sister were kidnapped.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.705
The friend was murdered.

30:14.739 --> 30:17.641
The sister is still alive,
and we're trying to rescue her.

30:17.675 --> 30:20.344
God.

30:20.378 --> 30:22.179
Well, so why are you making that dude

30:22.214 --> 30:24.681
think that he's some kind
of citizen police officer?

30:24.716 --> 30:27.617
The parents of these children
know that they were kidnapped,

30:27.652 --> 30:30.054
but we've yet to tell them
that their son is dead,

30:30.088 --> 30:32.756
and we do not want our
guest informing them.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.191
So you lied to the parents about their son.

30:34.225 --> 30:37.094
We withheld information, yes.

30:37.129 --> 30:38.629
But you're breaking the rules.

30:38.664 --> 30:40.832
No, Rusty, I am not breaking any rules.

30:40.866 --> 30:43.034
I'm trying very hard to make decisions

30:43.102 --> 30:45.269
that could save another child's life.

30:45.303 --> 30:48.739
I'm sorry to interrupt, but,
Captain, we have another call.

30:48.773 --> 30:50.841
Okay. Um, you can play chess on my computer

30:50.875 --> 30:52.643
if you've done your homework.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.380
Okay.

30:56.414 --> 30:58.014
6:00. Where?

30:58.049 --> 31:01.284
Hollywood Western Metro Station, red line.

31:01.318 --> 31:02.686
Okay, the red line.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.020
You come alone. You understand me?

31:04.055 --> 31:05.655
Yes, I understand.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.024
If I even think that
someone else is with you,

31:07.058 --> 31:08.158
your kids are dead.

31:10.695 --> 31:12.129
6:00. Rush hour.

31:12.163 --> 31:14.365
A lot of foot traffic around
the train that time of day.

31:14.399 --> 31:15.699
Easy to blend in.

31:15.734 --> 31:16.767
And the phone?

31:16.802 --> 31:18.169
Same as last time... untraceable.

31:18.203 --> 31:20.171
We still have a bird's-eye
view of the city.

31:20.206 --> 31:21.873
We can follow Mr. Barlow
to the subway stop...

31:21.907 --> 31:23.341
Well, that's all well and good, Buzz,

31:23.375 --> 31:25.143
but the drop is being handled underground.

31:25.177 --> 31:27.212
We'll need S.I.S. inside
and outside the metro

31:27.246 --> 31:29.348
everywhere we can put them.

31:29.382 --> 31:31.184
Nothing's gonna happen to that
girl until they get their cash,

31:31.218 --> 31:32.752
but then they'll kill her.

31:32.786 --> 31:34.454
Well, Gerald will go get his guns first,

31:34.488 --> 31:36.356
which means it's all
up to Sanchez and Sykes.

31:36.391 --> 31:38.391
Maybe. "Maybe" is not good enough.

31:38.426 --> 31:41.795
Lieutenant Tao, while you're
keeping watch on the Barlows,

31:41.829 --> 31:43.930
order a tactical rollout for major crimes.

31:43.965 --> 31:45.432
I want thermal imaging.

31:45.467 --> 31:47.101
I want mobile operations.

31:47.135 --> 31:49.403
We need to be prepared
for a rescue just in case.

31:56.811 --> 31:58.779
Should I pull the car around back?

31:58.813 --> 32:00.047
We'll take care of it.

32:00.081 --> 32:02.816
Where are your keys?

32:04.152 --> 32:05.719
Want to tell us who you're calling?

32:05.753 --> 32:07.120
Or you want to tell us
where the Barlow kids are?

32:07.154 --> 32:08.454
Fish, what's going on here?

32:08.489 --> 32:09.956
I have no idea, Gerald.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.391
Concealed weapon.

32:11.425 --> 32:12.425
Not good.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.266
It's safe, ma'am.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.968
Sir, you have the right to remain silent.

32:21.002 --> 32:24.305
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

32:24.339 --> 32:25.472
You have the right to an attorney.

32:25.507 --> 32:27.074
If you cannot afford an attorney,

32:27.108 --> 32:29.276
one will be appointed for you by the state.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.845
Mr. Hall, I'm Deputy
District Attorney Hobbs.

32:31.913 --> 32:34.081
I'll be prosecuting you for
the murder of Ben Barlow.

32:34.115 --> 32:35.516
I have paperwork for you to sign here

32:35.550 --> 32:37.418
saying that you are both defending yourself

32:37.452 --> 32:39.120
and agreeing to a conviction

32:39.154 --> 32:40.989
of kidnapping and first-degree murder.

32:41.023 --> 32:43.891
In exchange for taking the
death penalty off the table,

32:43.926 --> 32:46.193
you will tell us where
Emily Barlow is right now.

32:46.228 --> 32:48.963
Lady, I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:48.997 --> 32:50.765
One second.

32:50.799 --> 32:52.901
Mr. Hall, we know that you're involved

32:52.935 --> 32:54.436
with the kidnapping of
Ben and Emily Barlow.

32:54.470 --> 32:57.039
We want Emily back alive.

32:57.073 --> 33:01.077
Sign these papers and you can save
your life and the girl's life, too.

33:03.114 --> 33:04.848
Barlow took my kids from me.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.983
So what do I care what happens to his?

33:07.018 --> 33:10.020
No one in the van. But I found this.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.122
Got to be a couple hundred
thousand dollars in here.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.191
Plus, there were four cases of rifles.

33:14.225 --> 33:16.059
Nothing illegal there.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.161
You guys got jack.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.529
Mr. Hall, I'm in a very big hurry.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.031
I do not recognize the authority

33:20.065 --> 33:21.799
of the District Attorney or any...

33:21.833 --> 33:23.033
Okay! Okay!

33:23.068 --> 33:25.536
Detective, since Captain Raydor isn't here

33:25.570 --> 33:29.073
and the suspect was armed,
I'll leave him to you.

33:29.107 --> 33:32.509
See if you can talk him into
signing this plea agreement.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.245
Mr. Fisher, come with me.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.004
Julio, what are you doing?

34:06.345 --> 34:08.045
You assaulted me.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.581
What?

34:09.614 --> 34:11.849
You attacked me, we
fought, you tore my shirt,

34:11.884 --> 34:14.051
you drew your concealed
weapon, tried to kill me.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.087
I didn't do anything to you.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.322
Oh!

34:19.358 --> 34:21.559
Looks like I have to protect my own life.

34:23.462 --> 34:24.896
Wait! Whoa!

34:24.929 --> 34:27.264
Aah! Whoa, whoa!

34:27.299 --> 34:29.367
No!

34:29.400 --> 34:31.101
Sanchez, stop! Stop!

34:31.136 --> 34:32.937
He's a murderer, and
he's never going to help!

34:32.971 --> 34:34.938
If the girl's going to die,
then he is going to die, too!

34:36.641 --> 34:38.041
Y... you can't do this.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.545
I know that you killed Ben Barlow.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.949
And I know that his sister's alive.

34:44.984 --> 34:48.286
You tell me where she's at
or I'm going to kill you.

34:48.321 --> 34:50.288
Do you understand?!

34:50.322 --> 34:52.556
I can't wait to kill you,
and I'll get away with it!

34:52.591 --> 34:58.296
So you tell me right now where
the girl is or you go to hell!

35:25.189 --> 35:27.290
It's up here, about 500 meters.

35:27.324 --> 35:28.390
500 meters ahead.

35:28.425 --> 35:29.491
Copy that, Julio.

35:29.526 --> 35:30.959
Thank you.

35:30.994 --> 35:32.161
Target is approximately 500 meters west

35:32.195 --> 35:33.696
of the van's present location.

35:33.730 --> 35:35.364
Where are you people?

35:35.431 --> 35:37.333
Lieutenant, we are 40
minutes from your action.

35:37.367 --> 35:38.334
Copy.

35:39.335 --> 35:42.270
Okay, S.I.S. is too far away.

35:42.305 --> 35:45.206
We can't let julio and Amy
drive in there without backup.

35:50.613 --> 35:53.348
Detective, I may need to relay orders

35:53.383 --> 35:55.151
to Lieutenants Flynn and Provenza,

35:55.185 --> 35:56.619
who are all the backup we have right now.

35:56.653 --> 35:58.388
Where is my picture?

35:58.455 --> 36:00.123
One last adjustment, ma'am.

36:00.157 --> 36:01.524
I have your live picture,

36:01.559 --> 36:04.328
and your thermal imaging is up and running.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.631
You screw this up,
Gerald, and I'll kill you.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.100
My father's thinking the same thing.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.536
I didn't want Barlow's kids to die.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.004
None of this was my idea.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.072
Right. You just collected the money.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.674
I tried to keep my father calm.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.642
You people stole his grandchildren.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.344
He's not gonna go down easy.

36:20.378 --> 36:23.146
Dad's lived his whole life
for a moment like this.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.481
Me too.

36:35.292 --> 36:37.126
Detective Sanchez,

36:37.160 --> 36:39.361
someone is in the rear of
the trailer on the floor.

36:39.396 --> 36:41.330
There is movement. She is alive.

36:41.365 --> 36:44.700
Do not hesitate to use force to
protect yourself or the hostage.

37:04.788 --> 37:06.088
You got the money?

37:06.123 --> 37:07.123
Yeah, dad, it's all good.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.257
You were supposed to call.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.625
What happened?

37:09.693 --> 37:11.560
Dad, uh, look...

37:17.133 --> 37:19.634
You been made, haven't you?

37:22.305 --> 37:24.505
Listen. I'm sorry, you know?

37:24.540 --> 37:26.140
The police found me.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.075
They came after me... dad!

37:28.109 --> 37:30.077
Aah!

37:48.330 --> 37:50.131
- Is the girl still lying down?!
- Yes!

37:50.165 --> 37:51.499
- Act now!
- Crossfire!

38:00.276 --> 38:02.310
Status! I need status!

38:02.344 --> 38:04.245
He's down, but I don't know if he's dead.

38:05.481 --> 38:07.348
Careful. Watch for trip wires.

38:14.323 --> 38:15.423
Hall's dead.

38:15.458 --> 38:16.758
Very, very dead.

38:18.327 --> 38:19.328
Emily, Emily!

38:19.362 --> 38:20.662
Aah! Aah!

38:20.697 --> 38:22.631
Emily! Emily!

38:22.665 --> 38:23.665
You're safe! You're safe!

38:23.699 --> 38:24.766
You're safe.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.468
You're safe. You're safe.

38:26.502 --> 38:28.337
You're safe. You're safe.

38:28.371 --> 38:29.872
You're safe. You're safe.

38:29.906 --> 38:31.773
You're safe.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.001
So, you saved the girl.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.304
Yes, we did.

40:15.338 --> 40:18.106
And what about the parents?

40:18.140 --> 40:20.174
They gonna be okay?

40:22.418 --> 40:24.913
It's impossible to know.

40:26.215 --> 40:29.712
We gave them their daughter back, so...

40:30.358 --> 40:33.321
we did our best.

40:35.624 --> 40:38.860
And now we...

40:38.895 --> 40:40.929
can stop for dinner on the way home.

40:44.033 --> 40:45.496
How was "Hamlet"?

40:45.616 --> 40:47.344
It's long.

40:47.464 --> 40:52.131
Hamlet is haunted by the ghost
of his father in the first act,

40:52.251 --> 40:55.861
and then his father
comes back for a minute.

40:55.981 --> 40:58.381
And then nothing really
happens until the end.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.883
So you actually read it.

41:00.918 --> 41:03.520
What, you... you think
I, like, lied to you?

41:03.554 --> 41:06.891
It's you police who lie
to everybody, Sharon.

41:06.925 --> 41:07.765
Mm.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.387
How... how do I know
that you won't lie to me

41:10.507 --> 41:12.033
if you think it's necessary?

41:12.528 --> 41:15.030
I won't lie to you. I promise.

41:15.064 --> 41:18.000
I'll tell you everything I know...

41:18.034 --> 41:21.737
as soon as I have had
a reasonable opportunity

41:21.772 --> 41:23.505
to assess the facts.

41:23.540 --> 41:24.940
What's this?

41:24.975 --> 41:28.344
It's what we're gonna
talk about over dinner.
