10:20.875 --> 10:24.411
that had to be Mr. Garvey's idea.

10:24.412 --> 10:26.613
I know you're busy, Wesley,
but I'd like to ask you

10:26.614 --> 10:27.914
some questions about what happened.

10:27.915 --> 10:29.549
You sure Mildred is OK?

10:29.550 --> 10:31.618
That woman is as tough as nails.

10:31.619 --> 10:34.021
The robber is just lucky
that he caught her off guard.

10:34.022 --> 10:36.757
That's for sure.
Mrs. Clarke ain't easy.

10:36.758 --> 10:38.859
Where were you
during the time of the robbery?

10:38.860 --> 10:40.360
I was having a nap.

10:40.361 --> 10:42.396
It was an exhausting day.

10:42.397 --> 10:43.730
Lionel and I were setting up

10:43.731 --> 10:45.098
for the picnic since early morning.

10:45.099 --> 10:47.701
I helped pack up. Went straight home.

10:47.702 --> 10:50.937
Was hungry, so I had a hoagie.
Why're you asking?

10:50.938 --> 10:53.206
We aren't accusing anyone.

10:53.207 --> 10:55.175
We're just asking questions.
It's part of our job.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.743
How well do you know Lionel?

10:56.744 --> 10:59.613
As well as I know my own brother.

10:59.614 --> 11:01.448
How long have you
worked with the U.N.I.A.?

11:01.449 --> 11:03.550
Time doesn't really matter.

11:03.551 --> 11:05.118
I'm a big supporter of the cause.

11:05.119 --> 11:08.655
Truth is, I can't help
but feel responsible

11:08.656 --> 11:09.890
for Mildred getting attacked.

11:09.891 --> 11:12.459
I lost my keys at the picnic,

11:12.460 --> 11:14.227
and... the thief may have found them.

11:14.228 --> 11:15.962
When did you notice your keys missing?

11:15.963 --> 11:18.699
- When I got home.
- Can anyone confirm

11:18.700 --> 11:20.067
your whereabouts during the robbery?

11:20.068 --> 11:22.302
- No.
- No.

11:22.303 --> 11:24.037
Only my Lord and Saviour.

11:24.038 --> 11:26.272
(SIGHING)

11:28.809 --> 11:30.477
(FRANKIE): Not one of them had
a decent alibi.

11:30.478 --> 11:31.945
But why would any of them steal money

11:31.946 --> 11:33.647
they had just raised
for the orphanage?

11:33.648 --> 11:35.048
It can't be one of them.

11:35.049 --> 11:36.917
What about Wesley's missing keys?

11:36.918 --> 11:39.486
Well, if someone stole them
from the picnic,

11:39.487 --> 11:40.787
then we have hundreds of suspects.

11:40.788 --> 11:42.222
Well, that's not very helpful.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.623
Well, why don't we just keep looking

11:43.624 --> 11:45.392
- at our dedicated threesome?
- Well, I could take a look

11:45.393 --> 11:46.660
at the police files.
See what comes up.

11:46.661 --> 11:48.895
- That's a start.
- You know, Mary, when you go,

11:48.896 --> 11:50.597
take a look at the bulletin
in the States.

11:50.598 --> 11:52.232
All right...

11:52.233 --> 11:54.468
Well, Lionel called
a sandwich "a hoagie."

11:54.469 --> 11:56.169
A bit of Yankee slang.

11:56.170 --> 11:58.305
It might be nothing,
but it's worth looking into.

11:58.306 --> 12:01.073
- OK. Consider it done.
- Thanks.

12:04.010 --> 12:07.047
So, you think Cora stole
the money just to spite Mildred?

12:07.048 --> 12:08.949
Well, she's definitely
mad at my mother.

12:08.950 --> 12:11.084
And she had a few choice words
about Mr. Garvey.

12:11.085 --> 12:12.686
Not exactly the rousing support

12:12.687 --> 12:14.221
that you would expect
from the treasurer.

12:14.222 --> 12:16.156
True. But that doesn't mean

12:16.157 --> 12:17.777
she stole the money
from the orphanage.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.894
- But who did?
- Someone who needed money

12:20.895 --> 12:23.063
in a hurry.

12:23.064 --> 12:25.197
♪

12:29.369 --> 12:33.407
- Let go of my hand, you brute!
- Please calm down, Mrs. Clarke.

12:33.408 --> 12:36.109
I know my rights.
You can't just drag me

12:36.110 --> 12:38.512
from my humble abode for no reason!

12:38.513 --> 12:40.213
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

12:40.214 --> 12:42.282
Well, if you think that I'm
inclined to talk to you

12:42.283 --> 12:44.050
after treatment like this,

12:44.051 --> 12:46.486
- you have another thing coming!
- Please just sit.

12:46.487 --> 12:49.623
Oh, Trudy! You and Frankie
need to get down to the station!

12:49.624 --> 12:51.691
- [RIGHT NOW!]
- Mary, what's going on?

12:51.692 --> 12:54.260
I think Detective Greyson is
trying to arrest your mother!

12:59.981 --> 13:03.417
♪

13:05.631 --> 13:07.332
Why is my mother under arrest?

13:07.333 --> 13:08.667
(SIGHING)

13:08.668 --> 13:10.235
She's not under arrest.

13:10.236 --> 13:11.603
Then why is she at the station?

13:11.604 --> 13:13.138
I was only asking her a few questions

13:13.139 --> 13:14.773
about a burglary
at the U.N.I.A. office.

13:14.774 --> 13:16.275
Which she has nothing to do with.

13:16.276 --> 13:18.777
Trudy, this man is calling me a thief.

13:18.778 --> 13:20.312
- That is not what I said.
- But you think

13:20.313 --> 13:23.849
- I'm in cahoots with one!
- Detective Greyson.

13:23.850 --> 13:26.185
- Ugh. You too.
- Please, tell me your theory.

13:26.186 --> 13:28.420
Did Mrs. Clarke throw herself
down to the ground

13:28.421 --> 13:30.422
before or after
she ran off with the money?

13:30.423 --> 13:32.291
I know that she did not
commit the burglary.

13:32.292 --> 13:34.226
I was only asking her a few questions.

13:34.227 --> 13:36.762
- Did she answer your questions?
- Yes.

13:36.763 --> 13:38.664
Then we're done here. Mama, let's go.

13:38.665 --> 13:43.368
- It's OK.
- Something wrong with my foot?

13:43.369 --> 13:44.902
Bye.

13:48.807 --> 13:50.309
From what I understand,

13:50.310 --> 13:53.846
nobody from the U.N.I.A.
reported the burglary to police.

13:53.847 --> 13:56.048
- So?
- So, how did you find out?

13:56.049 --> 13:58.851
- Do you have a spy?
- Why would we do that?

13:58.852 --> 14:02.488
Certain people feel threatened
by Mr. Garvey and his message.

14:02.489 --> 14:04.323
Thank you for the lesson in politics.

14:04.324 --> 14:07.326
- So, how did you find out?
- That's none of your concern.

14:07.327 --> 14:08.994
Mrs. Clarke is my concern.

14:08.995 --> 14:10.996
We wouldn't be
having this conversation

14:10.997 --> 14:12.731
had she just gone straight home.

14:12.732 --> 14:15.700
Why did she go back
and recount the money? Hmm?

14:17.336 --> 14:18.836
I gotta get back to work.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.074
I'm fine.

14:25.444 --> 14:27.012
Did you tell Detective Greyson

14:27.013 --> 14:28.680
that you went back
to recount the money?

14:28.681 --> 14:31.517
No. I didn't mention it
for the sake of discretion.

14:31.518 --> 14:34.353
- Well, somehow he knows.
- How'd he find out?

14:34.354 --> 14:37.589
Only one person knew. Guess who...

14:37.590 --> 14:39.258
Cora the treasurer.

14:39.259 --> 14:41.592
I warned you about her.

14:46.198 --> 14:48.967
Yes, I called the police.
And I'd do it again.

14:48.968 --> 14:51.303
Mr. Garvey asked
to keep this matter private.

14:51.304 --> 14:52.638
Why go against his wishes?

14:52.639 --> 14:54.273
When you love something
with all your heart,

14:54.274 --> 14:56.175
you do anything you can to save it.

14:56.176 --> 14:58.944
You mean the U.N.I.A.?
What're you saving it from?

14:58.945 --> 15:01.413
From itself!
Garvey's mistrust of the police

15:01.414 --> 15:04.349
is backwards thinking. We have a
right to be protected from crime

15:04.350 --> 15:05.951
- like everyone else.
- Well, have you had

15:05.952 --> 15:07.386
this conversation with Mr. Garvey?

15:07.387 --> 15:10.722
- There's no point.
- I'm sure he's a reasonable man.

15:10.723 --> 15:12.925
Let's just say
it's his way or the doorway.

15:12.926 --> 15:15.060
If you disagree with him,
then you might as well leave.

15:15.061 --> 15:17.262
Tell your mother
I wish her luck as treasurer.

15:17.263 --> 15:19.130
I quit.

15:20.833 --> 15:22.968
And if you really want to figure
out what happened to that money,

15:22.969 --> 15:24.870
take a closer look
at Lionel and Wesley.

15:24.871 --> 15:26.805
- What do you mean?
- They were having

15:26.806 --> 15:28.373
a big argument at the picnic.

15:28.374 --> 15:30.142
But I thought they were friends.

15:30.143 --> 15:31.743
Well, that's what was
so strange about it.

15:31.744 --> 15:34.745
And Wesley has been acting
very secretive ever since.

15:37.783 --> 15:40.786
- What's the hurry?
- You just lost your treasurer.

15:40.787 --> 15:43.355
Cora? She's a founding member
of this chapter.

15:43.356 --> 15:45.190
- What happened?
- Let's say she has a difference

15:45.191 --> 15:47.292
of opinion when it comes
to some of your decisions.

15:47.293 --> 15:49.061
That is not a new phenomenon.

15:49.062 --> 15:51.996
- She also tipped off the police.
- Not a new phenomenon either.

15:53.031 --> 15:54.867
You just take everything in stride.

15:54.868 --> 15:57.236
I am philosophical about such things.

15:57.237 --> 16:01.907
I have learned I can't be all
the things to all my people.

16:01.908 --> 16:04.343
But what you do give is
all black people a sense of...

16:04.344 --> 16:07.312
identity. A sense that
being from Africa

16:07.313 --> 16:08.914
is actually something to be proud of,

16:08.915 --> 16:10.816
and that's a powerful message.

16:10.817 --> 16:12.684
You're a rare and special mold.

16:12.685 --> 16:15.187
Never have I met a female detective,

16:15.188 --> 16:17.623
let alone one of my own African kin.

16:17.624 --> 16:19.825
I see good things
for you, Trudy Clarke.

16:19.826 --> 16:23.795
I want you to come
to New York and join my team.

16:23.796 --> 16:25.631
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

16:25.632 --> 16:28.133
Our movement is growing.
And we need good people

16:28.134 --> 16:31.402
like you to help spread the word
and build bridges.

16:33.405 --> 16:35.874
- I don't know what to say.
- I hope you know

16:35.875 --> 16:37.042
I don't just invite anyone.

16:37.043 --> 16:38.976
Of course.

16:39.878 --> 16:42.014
But I need to think about it.

16:42.015 --> 16:44.349
I expect an answer in two days,

16:44.350 --> 16:46.852
before I leave for New York.

16:46.853 --> 16:49.286
That answer should be yes.

16:54.793 --> 16:56.428
A thief wouldn't call
the police on themselves,

16:56.429 --> 16:58.195
so Cora is out.

16:59.164 --> 17:03.034
And that leaves... Wesley and Lionel.

17:05.470 --> 17:07.338
And the ghost of Queen Victoria.

17:08.473 --> 17:10.541
Oh. Sorry. My mind is elsewhere.

17:10.542 --> 17:15.079
- And where is it?
- New York.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.882
Mr. Garvey offered me a job with him.

17:16.883 --> 17:19.718
He's thinking of opening
a detective agency?

17:19.719 --> 17:21.386
Well, he asked me
to come work for him.

17:21.387 --> 17:23.154
Help the organization to grow.

17:24.522 --> 17:28.327
Wow. That is quite the offer.

17:28.328 --> 17:31.163
- What about the agency?
- I would hate

17:31.164 --> 17:33.365
- to see you leave, but...
- Say it.

17:33.366 --> 17:34.833
I would never forgive myself

17:34.834 --> 17:37.035
if you turned this opportunity
because of me.

17:37.036 --> 17:39.771
But New York City?

17:39.772 --> 17:41.907
I mean, I've barely been
outside of Ontario.

17:41.908 --> 17:44.343
I can't just up and leave.
Isn't it a bit crazy?

17:44.344 --> 17:47.012
Crazy can be a good thing.

17:47.013 --> 17:48.280
After all you've done for me?

17:48.281 --> 17:49.681
You've done just as much for me.

17:49.682 --> 17:51.516
I'd probably still be washing dishes

17:51.517 --> 17:53.685
- and cleaning dirty laundry.
- No, you wouldn't.

17:53.686 --> 17:55.821
Look. All that matters is that

17:55.822 --> 17:57.421
you do what's best for you.

17:58.857 --> 18:00.158
Look, I can't be thinking
about this right now.

18:00.159 --> 18:02.594
We still have a robbery to solve.

18:02.595 --> 18:04.096
So, who are we looking at?

18:04.097 --> 18:05.931
Well, Cora said
that she heard an argument

18:05.932 --> 18:07.466
between Lionel and Wesley
at the picnic,

18:07.467 --> 18:09.234
and that he's been
acting strange ever since.

18:09.235 --> 18:11.403
He volunteered that he lost his keys,

18:11.404 --> 18:13.071
which seems a little too convenient.

18:13.072 --> 18:14.239
Do you think that argument with Lionel

18:14.240 --> 18:16.308
has something to do with the robbery?

18:16.309 --> 18:18.443
Trudy! Oh, my goodness.

18:18.444 --> 18:20.245
You were so right about the hoagie!

18:20.246 --> 18:22.080
Lionel is an American.

18:22.081 --> 18:23.548
Uh, may I have a plate, please?

18:23.549 --> 18:24.750
How do you know that?

18:24.751 --> 18:27.319
Well, every month,
we get these bulletins

18:27.320 --> 18:29.154
from the U.S.
about fugitives and the like.

18:29.155 --> 18:30.455
Take a look at this one.

18:30.456 --> 18:32.224
We received this last July.

18:32.225 --> 18:34.326
A coloured man named Lionel Harris

18:34.327 --> 18:36.695
is wanted in Rochester for murder.

18:36.696 --> 18:38.429
Thank you. Look familiar?

18:39.598 --> 18:41.933
- It's Lionel Griffith.
- I think it's time we visit

18:41.934 --> 18:43.568
Lionel and Wesley at their homes.

18:43.569 --> 18:45.402
Well, preferably while they're out.

18:48.140 --> 18:50.241
♪

18:51.576 --> 18:53.311
No sign of the missing money.

18:53.312 --> 18:55.847
Look at this. Lionel was in Rochester.

18:55.848 --> 18:58.450
Fourth of July, that's right
around the time of the murder.

18:58.451 --> 18:59.818
We need to find out more about this.

18:59.819 --> 19:01.586
And why Lionel's a suspect.

19:01.587 --> 19:04.122
A trip south of the border
might be in order.

19:04.123 --> 19:06.091
Oh, well, actually...

19:06.092 --> 19:07.292
Sorry, sorry to interrupt,

19:07.293 --> 19:08.827
but I actually have
the day off tomorrow,

19:08.828 --> 19:10.896
so I could do a little field trip.

19:10.897 --> 19:12.630
Happy travels.

19:14.666 --> 19:17.836
So, if Lionel is our wanted man
in Rochester, what's he doing

19:17.837 --> 19:19.438
stealing money from the orphanage?

19:19.439 --> 19:21.605
And does it connect to Wesley?

19:22.607 --> 19:25.910
Wesley's landlady has
no idea where he is.

19:26.645 --> 19:27.946
But one thing is for sure...

19:27.947 --> 19:29.580
Wesley is an avid reader.

19:30.482 --> 19:32.349
He's also our thief.

19:34.519 --> 19:36.788
It's empty. (SIGHING)

19:36.789 --> 19:37.923
Where'd he go?

19:37.924 --> 19:39.423
And why'd he take the money?

19:41.626 --> 19:43.027
I have an idea.

19:44.729 --> 19:46.031
An old spy trick?

19:46.032 --> 19:48.233
Yeah. Guess who showed it to me.

19:48.234 --> 19:51.670
"Prospect Park. 9PM. Gardener's shed."

19:51.671 --> 19:53.971
Let's go catch a thief.

19:58.076 --> 20:00.178
So, Wesley stole the money
and had a rendezvous

20:00.179 --> 20:01.369
with someone
in the middle of the night.

20:01.370 --> 20:03.515
- Why?
- I guess we'll have to ask him

20:03.516 --> 20:04.816
when we find him.

20:04.817 --> 20:06.717
(GASPING)

20:11.056 --> 20:12.624
Oh, my God! It's Wesley!

20:12.625 --> 20:14.992
We're too late. He's dead.

20:21.276 --> 20:23.145
This is devastating news.

20:23.146 --> 20:25.581
Wesley Hampton was a good man.
Who would want to kill him?

20:25.582 --> 20:27.616
We found a cash box in his room.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.885
So, it turns out Wesley is a thief.

20:29.886 --> 20:32.588
That can't be. That man's
character is beyond reproach.

20:32.589 --> 20:34.923
You must find his killer
and clear his name.

20:34.924 --> 20:37.059
I'm not sure we're gonna
be able to clear his name.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.595
- Meaning?
- The cash box didn't just

20:39.596 --> 20:41.129
end up in his room by itself.

20:41.130 --> 20:44.266
Mm. You must get
to the bottom of this.

20:44.267 --> 20:47.069
And now, more than ever,
I am relying on your discretion.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.037
Can you assure me of that?

20:49.038 --> 20:50.338
You have our word.

20:54.176 --> 20:56.310
Don't let me down.

21:09.524 --> 21:11.460
No pressure to solve this one.

21:11.461 --> 21:14.529
Maybe working for Mr. Garvey
won't be a walk in Central Park.

21:14.530 --> 21:16.431
Well, I'm sure you'll
rise to the challenge.

21:16.432 --> 21:18.233
So, you're trying to get rid of me?

21:18.234 --> 21:20.434
At least I'll have
a place to stay in New York.

21:22.271 --> 21:24.777
But truthfully, I have no idea

21:24.778 --> 21:25.978
how I'm gonna replace you.

21:25.979 --> 21:28.881
I'm sure you'll rise to the challenge.

21:28.882 --> 21:31.384
Any luck tracking down Lionel?

21:31.385 --> 21:34.987
Well, I went to his boarding
house, but he hadn't been there.

21:34.988 --> 21:36.956
I guess we need to keep looking.

21:36.957 --> 21:39.058
- What about Wesley?
- Well, I asked the landlady,

21:39.059 --> 21:39.992
and she said he'd been getting

21:39.993 --> 21:41.961
a lot of long distance calls

21:41.962 --> 21:43.563
and when she asked,
he was cagey about it.

21:43.564 --> 21:46.432
He's been secretive
about a lot of things lately.

21:46.433 --> 21:47.633
(KNOCKING)

21:47.634 --> 21:49.101
Thank you.

21:49.102 --> 21:50.368
We'll see you in a few weeks.

21:51.671 --> 21:53.411
Maybe our mystery caller
will call back.

21:55.374 --> 21:58.044
We need someone at the rooming
house to watch the phones.

21:58.045 --> 22:00.912
Who has all day to sit
and wait for a call?

22:03.449 --> 22:05.351
Thank you so much
for doing this, Mrs. Clarke.

22:05.352 --> 22:08.087
I know the gravity of the situation.

22:08.088 --> 22:10.089
God rest that poor man's soul.

22:10.090 --> 22:11.857
So, if anyone calls for Wesley...

22:11.858 --> 22:14.226
I am to try to get
a name and a number.

22:14.227 --> 22:16.128
And try to find out how they know him.

22:16.129 --> 22:20.299
All right. I will not move from
this here chair until kingdom come.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.402
Elroy will just have to prepare
his own supper tonight.

22:23.403 --> 22:24.904
I knew I could count on you.

22:24.905 --> 22:26.005
Mm-hmm.

22:28.307 --> 22:31.611
No! This phone is off limits!

22:31.612 --> 22:34.880
I am doing
official detective business!

22:34.881 --> 22:36.214
MOVE!

22:39.852 --> 22:41.986
(SEAGULLS CALLING)

22:44.557 --> 22:46.359
A ferry ride across the lake
does a gal good

22:46.360 --> 22:48.461
on a day like this.
I'm glad you brought me along.

22:48.462 --> 22:50.663
Well, at least we both had
the same day off.

22:50.664 --> 22:53.399
So, what's the plan? When we
get to the station, I mean.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.168
Well, no doubt we'll face
the usual amount of confusion

22:56.169 --> 22:57.970
and hostility because of who we are.

22:57.971 --> 23:00.506
- A couple of skirts.
- But we just need to hold firm

23:00.507 --> 23:02.742
and persist in our quest
to speak with to whomever

23:02.743 --> 23:06.078
is in charge of file number 81372.

23:06.079 --> 23:08.014
So, we're gonna say
we're special constables

23:08.015 --> 23:09.315
from a Toronto police station.

23:09.316 --> 23:12.218
Yes, but it's a precinct here,
not a station,

23:12.219 --> 23:15.121
and it's not constable, it's officer.

23:15.122 --> 23:17.923
Red hots, constables, officers.

23:17.924 --> 23:19.191
Jeez, it's like a whole new language.

23:19.192 --> 23:21.594
- I'm just gonna let you do the talking.
- Uh, OK.

23:21.595 --> 23:23.195
They might speak a different
language down here,

23:23.196 --> 23:25.631
but a cop shop's a cop shop
no matter where you are.

23:25.632 --> 23:26.966
They certainly smell the same.

23:26.967 --> 23:30.036
A unique combination
of sweat and superiority.

23:30.037 --> 23:31.202
(MARY GIGGLING)

23:34.440 --> 23:36.842
Good afternoon, sir.
Perhaps you can help us.

23:36.843 --> 23:38.676
Lost your dog or something, gals?

23:39.745 --> 23:42.615
Actually, we were hoping
to speak with an officer

23:42.616 --> 23:45.650
regarding file number 81372.

23:47.019 --> 23:49.354
Ah... You're looking
for Officer McElroy.

23:50.623 --> 23:51.956
Take a load off.

23:55.828 --> 23:57.396
He's just the opening act.

23:57.397 --> 23:59.165
Wait for the main event.

23:59.166 --> 24:02.001
One Officer McElroy.

24:02.002 --> 24:04.403
Gird your loins, Mary.

24:04.404 --> 24:06.172
He's not just gonna roll over
and give us the scoop.

24:06.173 --> 24:07.606
He's gonna test our mettle, won't he?

24:07.607 --> 24:09.241
- Mm-hmm.
- Officer Nellie McElroy

24:09.242 --> 24:10.543
at your service.

24:10.544 --> 24:13.713
Something wrong?

24:13.714 --> 24:16.315
- Stop the starin'.
- Sorry.

24:16.316 --> 24:18.150
We've just never seen
a lady cop before.

24:18.151 --> 24:20.084
It is an absolute honour.

24:21.087 --> 24:23.189
- Where you from?
- Toronto in Canada.

24:23.190 --> 24:24.890
Mary here, she's kind of a cop.

24:24.891 --> 24:27.359
- A morality officer.
- She can't do much...

24:27.360 --> 24:29.228
but she gets to wear the uniform.

24:29.229 --> 24:30.629
Well, as long as you're
gettin' your pension,

24:30.630 --> 24:32.665
you'll do all right.

24:32.666 --> 24:34.800
What did I say about the starin'?

24:34.801 --> 24:37.069
I'm sorry. We don't mean
to make a big deal, it's...

24:37.070 --> 24:38.704
it's just that you're
kind of a big deal!

24:38.705 --> 24:40.740
- (CHUCKLING)
- Well, you can put a hold

24:40.741 --> 24:43.342
on my bronze statue. I still
have to make meatloaf

24:43.343 --> 24:45.277
for my sisters when I finish my shift.

24:45.278 --> 24:48.013
- Now, what can I do for you?
- Oh, uh...

24:48.014 --> 24:49.514
A job in New York?

24:50.750 --> 24:52.890
You must've made quite
the impression on Mr. Garvey.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.921
I only just met him. I don't
know why he offered it to me.

24:55.922 --> 24:58.724
Mr. Garvey is a brilliant man...

24:58.725 --> 25:02.261
I'm sure he sees in you
what everyone else sees.

25:02.262 --> 25:03.728
What's that?

25:05.131 --> 25:07.333
You're smart.

25:07.334 --> 25:08.867
Strong. Fearless.

25:09.835 --> 25:12.104
Passionate about helping people...

25:12.105 --> 25:14.272
Why wouldn't Mr. Garvey
want you to work for him?

25:15.274 --> 25:17.176
But I can't leave behind
my mama, and...

25:17.177 --> 25:18.711
and my siblings...

25:18.712 --> 25:20.179
and you.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.982
I'm just a train ride away.

25:22.983 --> 25:24.784
It's too expensive.

25:24.785 --> 25:26.784
I can't have you going
back and forth like that.

25:28.387 --> 25:31.290
We could talk about...
me moving there too.

25:31.291 --> 25:32.958
You'd move to New York with me?

25:32.959 --> 25:35.895
I... I've got my... my job
and my family to consider.

25:35.896 --> 25:38.429
But... but... but I'll really try.

25:40.065 --> 25:43.768
Marcus Garvey isn't the only one who
has big plans for Trudy Clarke.

25:46.939 --> 25:48.407
Thanks for always being there for me.

25:48.408 --> 25:50.176
I'll always be there for you.

25:50.177 --> 25:52.510
Even when I tell Mama about New York?

25:53.712 --> 25:55.781
- Me? Uh-uh.
- Ah!

25:55.782 --> 25:57.615
You're on your own with that one.

25:59.251 --> 26:01.020
I remember this case clear as day.

26:01.021 --> 26:03.122
Harold Clifford, a white lawyer.

26:03.123 --> 26:05.591
Stabbed and robbed just yards
from his front door.

26:05.592 --> 26:07.793
- That was July of last year?
- Mm-hmm.

26:07.794 --> 26:10.296
Clifford was found dead outside
his apartment building.

26:10.297 --> 26:12.832
A witness claimed to see a cab
parked down the street.

26:12.833 --> 26:15.434
It was registered to a Lionel Harris.

26:15.435 --> 26:17.136
Did you speak with Mr. Harris?

26:17.137 --> 26:19.905
He vanished before I had the chance.

26:19.906 --> 26:21.128
You're sure he's the killer?

26:21.129 --> 26:24.310
Mm-hmm. Harris' girlfriend
came forward with an alibi,

26:24.311 --> 26:26.045
but for some reason
was deemed not credible.

26:26.046 --> 26:28.747
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

26:28.748 --> 26:30.094
I never spoke to her. Another officer

26:30.095 --> 26:31.417
took her statement and dismissed it

26:31.418 --> 26:33.786
- without explanation.
- What's the girlfriend's name?

26:33.787 --> 26:35.221
Victoria Challenger.

26:35.222 --> 26:38.423
"Victoria Challenger." Do you
have an address for her?

26:39.491 --> 26:41.393
Why exactly are you two
so interested in this case?

26:41.394 --> 26:44.663
We're just following up on a
lead for a detective in Toronto.

26:44.664 --> 26:46.732
Just trying to score
some brownie points.

26:46.733 --> 26:49.235
I hope to wear
the badge someday, like you.

26:49.236 --> 26:51.604
Ah.

26:51.605 --> 26:54.273
Well, if you learn anything
about the case, let me know.

26:54.274 --> 26:55.808
Oh, absolutely!

26:55.809 --> 26:58.109
Us gals in uniform
need to stick together.

26:59.778 --> 27:02.214
And about that badge, Officer Shaw...

27:02.215 --> 27:05.049
- we call it a shield.
- "A shield."

27:14.360 --> 27:15.994
Is something wrong?

27:16.962 --> 27:18.822
You go on ahead.
I'll catch up in a minute.

27:20.165 --> 27:21.499
Sure thing.

27:25.070 --> 27:27.273
- What's your secret?
- Excuse me?

27:27.274 --> 27:29.708
How did you convince them
to let you be a cop?

27:29.709 --> 27:31.777
- Ah.
- It's just that you are doing

27:31.778 --> 27:33.679
the only thing
that I have ever wanted to do,

27:33.680 --> 27:35.681
and if I'm being completely honest,

27:35.682 --> 27:38.550
I'm not sure I even thought
it was possible.

27:38.551 --> 27:40.185
Maybe because I'd never
seen it done before,

27:40.186 --> 27:42.454
but... here you are! You are a...

27:42.455 --> 27:44.156
lady cop. (CHUCKLING)

27:44.157 --> 27:45.658
And if they can do it
in Rochester, I'm sure

27:45.659 --> 27:47.793
that they can do it in Toronto.

27:47.794 --> 27:49.827
So, what do I do?

27:52.364 --> 27:54.177
It's an uphill climb, honey.
The boys have

27:54.178 --> 27:55.768
a hard time wrapping
their heads around

27:55.769 --> 27:58.404
- the idea of women cops.
- Yeah, I know. Why is that?

27:58.405 --> 28:01.373
Don't they understand that we would
approach the job differently?

28:01.374 --> 28:05.343
Women can just do things that,
well, men can't.

28:07.146 --> 28:09.548
Best advice I can give you:
keep honing your chops

28:09.549 --> 28:11.150
at whatever side job
this is you're working.

28:11.151 --> 28:13.419
Oh. Oh, no. I really am here
on official business.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.154
I don't care if it's official
or off the books.

28:15.155 --> 28:16.755
The point is you're doing the work.

28:16.756 --> 28:18.457
You're already a cop, Shaw.

28:18.458 --> 28:20.758
Now, you have to wait for
the world to catch up to you.

28:24.496 --> 28:28.400
So you want to leave your
family and move to New York?

28:28.401 --> 28:30.369
Well, it's not that I want
to leave, it's just that

28:30.370 --> 28:32.270
that's where the job would take me.

28:33.539 --> 28:35.708
But your brothers won't have
their big sister around

28:35.709 --> 28:39.444
anymore and I won't have
anybody to drive me to church.

28:41.013 --> 28:44.816
- Well? What do you think?
- Just... just give me a...

28:45.684 --> 28:48.052
Mama say something, anything!

28:51.557 --> 28:53.292
You must take the job and go.

28:53.293 --> 28:57.129
This is the opportunity of a lifetime!

28:57.130 --> 29:01.500
- Wait... what?
- Trudy, I am so proud of you.

29:01.501 --> 29:03.902
You will have the platform

29:03.903 --> 29:07.840
to help so many suffering
working with Mr. Garvey.

29:07.841 --> 29:10.675
Oh, God has great things
in store for you!

29:12.211 --> 29:14.279
That's it, I'm taking the job.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.449
I'm moving to New York City!

29:17.450 --> 29:19.852
Praise Jesus! And you can leave

29:19.853 --> 29:21.754
all this detective
business behind you.

29:21.755 --> 29:25.024
- Oh.
- No more dead bodies.

29:25.025 --> 29:28.426
NO! This phone is unavailable!

29:29.661 --> 29:31.762
MOVE!

29:34.299 --> 29:35.467
Mama!

29:35.468 --> 29:37.236
Detective Greyson.

29:37.237 --> 29:38.871
I take it this isn't a social visit.

29:38.872 --> 29:41.974
It's not a secret that we're
working on the same case.

29:41.975 --> 29:44.309
Mr. Hampton's untimely demise
in Prospect Park.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.779
Seems you have an uncanny knack

29:46.780 --> 29:48.180
for stumbling across dead bodies.

29:48.181 --> 29:50.082
It's gumshoe's luck.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.317
Don't suppose you wanna share
the coroner's report with me?

29:52.318 --> 29:53.752
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, come on. I'm gonna

29:53.753 --> 29:56.320
find out sooner or later.

- A classic military technique.
- You served?

30:06.433 --> 30:08.033
I did.

30:08.034 --> 30:11.870
- Fourth battalion. You?
- Nothing quite as illustrious.

30:11.871 --> 30:13.972
- I was a dispatch rider.
- Signal Corps.

30:13.973 --> 30:17.376
- Were you in France?
- Here and there.

30:17.377 --> 30:18.811
Something tells me that you did

30:18.812 --> 30:21.113
- more than just deliver messages.
- I was just a gal on a bike.

30:21.114 --> 30:23.082
Hm. I bet you were.

not be the only one

- Meaning that trouble follows

30:43.469 --> 30:45.169
He's had a death threat against him.

that your client

forthcoming with you.

board the S.S. Yarmouth,

to see my client?

Let Miss Drake pass, Avery.

31:08.594 --> 31:10.696
Wesley's murder has
everyone a little rattled.

31:10.697 --> 31:13.065
You didn't tell me you
received a death threat.

31:13.066 --> 31:15.767
- I didn't see the relevance.
- You're not concerned?

31:15.768 --> 31:17.603
That's why I hired Avery
as my security.

31:17.604 --> 31:20.072
Well, you seem to be doing
a lot of hiring these days.

special, like Miss Clarke.

I've been trying to keep track
of all the moving parts.

We have Wesley, a thief,

31:45.899 --> 31:48.800
- who has been murdered.
- And Lionel, his best friend,

31:48.801 --> 31:50.736
who's been accused of a murder
in Rochester.

31:50.737 --> 31:53.005
Could Lionel have known
that he took the money?

31:53.006 --> 31:55.641
- So he robbed him?
- And killed him?

31:55.642 --> 31:58.644
- Something's not adding up.
- Ladies!

32:10.323 --> 32:12.324
So, back to Rochester...

32:12.325 --> 32:14.659
Oh, the victim's name is
Harold Clifford.

32:16.595 --> 32:18.630
This is Clifford.
According to the report,

32:18.631 --> 32:21.767
He left the bank, got in a taxi,
and was later found dead

32:21.768 --> 32:23.569
outside of his apartment building.

32:23.570 --> 32:25.637
His wallet was gone, and the
police think he struggled

32:25.638 --> 32:27.906
with the robber before he
was shot. Kicked up a real fuss.

32:27.907 --> 32:29.374
What does that have to do with Lionel?

32:29.375 --> 32:31.710
Well, someone saw
a Hasty Taxi parked out front

32:31.711 --> 32:34.213
of Clifford's apartment
building, and that taxi

32:34.214 --> 32:35.681
was registered to Lionel Harris.

32:35.682 --> 32:37.749
So, he became the cops'
prime suspect for the murder.

32:37.750 --> 32:40.085
But, but we talked
with Lionel's girlfriend,

32:40.086 --> 32:42.554
- Victoria Challenger.
- And she swears he's innocent.

32:42.555 --> 32:45.157
At the time of the murder,
she was working as a maid

32:45.158 --> 32:47.426
- in a building near Clifford's.
- And they had an arrangement.

32:47.427 --> 32:48.994
If he was driving
around the neighbourhood,

32:48.995 --> 32:51.263
- he would stop by and see her.
- As chance would have it,

32:51.264 --> 32:53.732
Lionel was visiting Victoria
at the time Clifford

32:53.733 --> 32:54.866
was robbed and murdered.

32:54.867 --> 32:56.768
That's why his cab was parked outside.

32:56.769 --> 32:58.604
And Victoria told the cops
he was there that night.

32:58.605 --> 33:00.872
- But they didn't believe her.
- Yeah, said she was

33:00.873 --> 33:02.874
- covering for him.
- So, he took off.

33:02.875 --> 33:04.375

- And how does it tie in

33:45.218 --> 33:46.852
We know about the murder.

33:46.853 --> 33:48.654
I didn't kill anyone.

33:48.655 --> 33:50.521
Then why did you run away?

and the victim's white,

to be short-sighted.

33:56.429 --> 33:58.129
So, you came to Canada.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.399
How did Victoria feel about that?

34:02.734 --> 34:05.115
She understood that we could
never see each other again.

of catching up with you.

34:13.079 --> 34:15.146
Someone recognized me.

34:16.447 --> 34:18.428
Two days ago, I received
a note demanding money.

34:19.251 --> 34:22.253
- Who's blackmailing you?
- The note didn't say.

34:23.822 --> 34:25.956
Did Wesley know about your past?

34:25.958 --> 34:28.126
He was my best friend.
I wanted him to know

34:28.127 --> 34:29.328
what he was getting involved with

34:29.329 --> 34:31.396
- by helping me the way he did.
- Did he know

34:31.397 --> 34:33.565
- about the blackmailer?
- That's what we were

34:33.565 --> 34:34.800
arguing about at the picnic.

34:34.801 --> 34:36.735
I told him I wasn't going to pay.

34:36.735 --> 34:39.670
That I was sick of running.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.572
Well, what did he say?

34:43.208 --> 34:44.842
That I was throwing my life away.

34:44.844 --> 34:48.913
Did you tell Wesley about
where to drop the money off?

34:50.014 --> 34:52.983
Yes... Prospect Park.

34:55.654 --> 34:58.557
That's why Wesley stole the
money, to pay the blackmailer.

34:58.558 --> 35:00.991
What are you saying?

- No...

(OVERLAPPING ACCLAMATIONS)

40:50.787 --> 40:53.155
So, what will you do
now that you're a free man?

40:53.156 --> 40:55.257
I'm still in disbelief.
After all this time,

40:55.258 --> 40:58.393
- my burden is lifted.
- Will you stay in Toronto,

40:58.394 --> 40:59.661
or are you gonna
head back to Rochester?

40:59.662 --> 41:02.297
I love my adopted city,
but I'm anxious to see

41:02.298 --> 41:06.168
my sweetheart again. That is,
if she still wants me.

41:06.169 --> 41:08.737
Well, there's one way to find out.

41:08.738 --> 41:10.474
Victoria was up for
a ferry ride across

41:10.475 --> 41:12.051
the lake to see her long-lost love.

41:16.611 --> 41:18.913
- Vicky.
- Lionel.

41:21.750 --> 41:23.885
I still can't believe it's really you.

41:23.886 --> 41:25.486
It's really me.

41:29.024 --> 41:30.924
See, it's that smile
that I missed the most.

41:31.993 --> 41:36.664
Thank you. I only wish
Wesley was still here.

41:37.766 --> 41:40.468
Trudy! I did really well
on my tests in school

41:40.469 --> 41:44.272
just like you said to! I even
learned to spell a new word.

41:44.273 --> 41:49.377
D-E-T-E-C-T-I-V-E.

41:49.378 --> 41:51.513
Detective!

41:51.514 --> 41:52.948
You're amazing, Ismay.

41:52.949 --> 41:55.917
Now, look. You keep applying
yourself like that in school,

41:55.918 --> 41:58.552
and you can do anything
you set your mind to.

42:01.656 --> 42:04.392
You've really made
an impression on that girl.

42:04.393 --> 42:06.661
And you will make
even a bigger impression

42:06.662 --> 42:09.564
- in New York City.
- The sky is the limit,

42:09.565 --> 42:11.366
wherever you go.

42:11.367 --> 42:13.702
You have my gratitude, Miss Drake.

42:13.703 --> 42:16.404
I won't let Wesley's
selflessness be forgotten.

42:16.405 --> 42:18.073
I'm just glad that we could help.

42:18.074 --> 42:21.209
And Trudy, pleased to hear
you'll be accepting my offer.

42:21.210 --> 42:22.811
Who told you?

42:22.812 --> 42:25.714
Your mother.
She could not contain herself.

42:25.715 --> 42:27.781
It was written all over her face.

42:28.850 --> 42:31.118
Well, I'm so appreciative
of the offer.

42:32.354 --> 42:35.156
But I won't be going to New York.

42:35.157 --> 42:38.793
Now, don't get me wrong...
I do want to make a difference,

42:38.794 --> 42:40.362
but I think I can do that right here.

42:40.363 --> 42:41.929
I'm disappointed.

42:44.733 --> 42:46.067
But I understand.

42:46.068 --> 42:48.436
And where are you
off to next, Mr. Garvey?

42:48.437 --> 42:51.772
Look for me
in the whirlwind of the storm.

42:56.411 --> 42:58.479
So... you're not leaving?

42:59.381 --> 43:01.215
I think I'll stick around
a little longer.

43:02.117 --> 43:04.252
- On one condition.
- Anything.

43:04.253 --> 43:06.454
You have to tell my mom
I'm still a private detective.

43:06.455 --> 43:07.622
Oh, no!

43:07.623 --> 43:09.257
