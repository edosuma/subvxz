WEBVTT

02:24.708 --> 02:27.711
We want Pollitt. Brick Pollitt.

02:27.794 --> 02:29.880
<i>We want Pollitt. Brick Pollitt.</i>

04:04.015 --> 04:05.559
Don't you do that!

04:06.101 --> 04:08.853
I'm warning you, Trixie. Gooper!

04:09.062 --> 04:12.399
Can't you stop your child
from putting her hands in the ice cream?

04:12.524 --> 04:13.567
Trixie.

04:14.693 --> 04:15.736
Trixie!

04:16.820 --> 04:19.613
Couldn't you at least wash your hands
before you did that?

04:30.959 --> 04:32.168
Maggie!

04:32.377 --> 04:34.295
<i>You stop that!</i>

04:34.504 --> 04:36.965
How could you do that to a child?

04:37.507 --> 04:39.843
Like this, honey.

04:46.724 --> 04:47.768
Gooper!

04:48.435 --> 04:50.687
Did you see what she did?

04:50.896 --> 04:54.024
I told her to wash her hands first.

05:09.289 --> 05:12.960
One of those no-neck monsters
hit me with some ice cream.

05:13.377 --> 05:16.421
<i>Why do you call Gooper's kiddies
"no-neck monsters"?</i>

05:16.588 --> 05:19.591
Because your brother's children
have got no necks.

05:20.675 --> 05:25.764
Their fat little heads sit on their fat
bodies without a bit of connection.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.349
That's too bad.

05:27.557 --> 05:31.353
Especially 'cause, if they have no necks
you can't wring them. Right, honey?

05:35.399 --> 05:36.650
Here we are!

05:36.733 --> 05:38.360
Come on, Buster, Sonny.

05:38.485 --> 05:40.695
Go get in the car. We're all going to go.

05:42.906 --> 05:45.909
Did you ever hear so many dog's names
tagged on to children?

05:46.117 --> 05:49.621
They've got five monsters
and number six coming up.

05:49.830 --> 05:53.667
They've brought the whole bunch here
like animals to display at a county fair.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.211
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.

05:56.419 --> 05:58.129
It's obvious what they're up to.

05:58.671 --> 06:01.008
What are they up to, Maggie?

06:02.968 --> 06:05.554
I'll tell you what they're
up to, boy of mine.

06:05.762 --> 06:09.015
They're up to cutting you out
of your father's estate.

06:09.974 --> 06:12.144
Everybody knows Big Daddy's...

06:12.352 --> 06:14.062
<i>dying of...</i>

06:15.063 --> 06:18.566
I ought to send Sister Woman
a bill for a new pair of stockings.

06:19.234 --> 06:20.276
Do we?

06:20.527 --> 06:21.694
Do we what?

06:22.820 --> 06:25.824
<i>Know that Big Daddy is dying of...</i>

06:26.575 --> 06:28.243
Don't you believe it?

06:28.660 --> 06:30.495
You'll know soon enough.

06:30.704 --> 06:32.497
Suppose he is?

06:32.705 --> 06:34.582
<i>There's some things you've got to face.</i>

06:34.666 --> 06:37.961
There's some things in this world
you've simply got to face.

06:38.378 --> 06:41.423
Why was Big Daddy in that horrible clinic
for six weeks...

06:41.506 --> 06:43.842
if the examination didn't show anything?

06:43.925 --> 06:48.097
Why did Brother Man bring his whole tribe
down here in this sticky heat?

06:48.680 --> 06:51.433
And why so many allusions
to you and Rainbow Hill?

06:52.309 --> 06:53.935
You know what Rainbow Hill is?

06:54.060 --> 06:57.814
It's a place that's famous for treating
famous alcoholics and dope fiends.

06:57.897 --> 06:59.023
I'm not famous.

06:59.149 --> 07:00.192
No...

07:00.442 --> 07:02.110
and you don't take dope.

07:02.319 --> 07:04.988
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate
for Rainbow Hill.

07:05.197 --> 07:08.450
That's where Brother Man's
going to tell Big Daddy to ship you.

07:09.033 --> 07:10.994
Over my dead body!

07:11.537 --> 07:13.455
Rainbow Hill.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.544
With you out of the way,
Gooper gets hold of the estate...

07:19.753 --> 07:23.173
signs the checks, and cuts off
our credit whenever he wants.

07:23.382 --> 07:25.467
How'd you like that, baby?

07:25.842 --> 07:27.552
You're doing just about everything...

07:27.719 --> 07:31.473
to aid and abet them
in grabbing control, after Big Daddy...

07:38.063 --> 07:39.481
Well, you are.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.817
Quitting work,
devoting yourself to drinking!

07:43.026 --> 07:46.112
Breaking your ankle last night
on the high school field.

07:47.406 --> 07:48.615
Brick?

07:49.866 --> 07:52.202
We've got one thing on our side.

07:52.702 --> 07:53.912
No, two things.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.747
Are my seams straight?

07:56.831 --> 07:58.708
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.

07:58.916 --> 08:01.878
He just can't stand Brother Man
and his wife...

08:02.087 --> 08:04.339
that fertility monster.
She's odious to him.

08:04.631 --> 08:05.631
I can tell.

08:05.799 --> 08:08.176
Just like I can tell he likes me.

08:08.384 --> 08:11.221
That's the second thing
we've got on our side.

08:16.601 --> 08:18.520
He likes me.

08:19.562 --> 08:23.400
<i>The way he looks me up and down,
and over...</i>

08:24.443 --> 08:26.445
He's still got an eye for girls.

08:26.653 --> 08:28.738
That kind of talk is disgusting.

08:30.323 --> 08:33.826
Anybody ever tell you
you were a back-aching Puritan?

08:34.202 --> 08:37.581
I think it's mighty fine how that
old fellow, on death's doorstep...

08:37.664 --> 08:41.208
takes in my shape with what
I consider deserved appreciation.

08:42.751 --> 08:47.466
Gooper still cherishes the illusion he
took a giant step up the social ladder...

08:47.674 --> 08:51.094
when he married Mae Flynn
of the no-neck Memphis Flynns...

08:51.303 --> 08:53.972
because she was queen
of the Cotton Carnival.

08:54.180 --> 08:57.058
I can just see Gooper
falling for Her Majesty...

08:57.267 --> 09:01.396
sitting on that brass throne,
riding that tacky float down Main Street...

09:01.605 --> 09:06.526
smiling and bowing, and blowing kisses
to all the trash on the street.

09:07.652 --> 09:09.696
You know what happened to her?

09:10.154 --> 09:11.657
No, what happened to her?

09:12.533 --> 09:15.577
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.

09:15.786 --> 09:19.372
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso
leaned out the window and said:

09:19.581 --> 09:22.417
<i>"Hey, Queenie! "</i>

09:22.625 --> 09:26.046
Sister Mae looked up and smiled
and waved...

09:26.254 --> 09:29.507
and that drunk shot a squirt
of tobacco juice...

09:29.674 --> 09:31.718
right in her face.

09:44.063 --> 09:45.940
Why are you looking at me like that?

09:47.025 --> 09:48.986
Like what?

09:49.486 --> 09:51.363
Like you were just looking.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.867
I wasn't conscious
of looking at you.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.373
I was conscious of it.

10:11.925 --> 10:14.636
- Lf you were thinking the same thing...
- No, Maggie!

10:14.845 --> 10:17.389
- Why not?
- Will you please keep your voice down?

10:17.556 --> 10:18.932
No!

10:20.225 --> 10:22.226
I know you better than you think.

10:22.435 --> 10:24.313
I've seen that look before...

10:24.521 --> 10:26.356
and I know what it used to mean.

10:26.565 --> 10:31.111
- And it still means the same thing now.
- You're not the same woman now, Maggie.

10:31.528 --> 10:33.821
Don't you think I know that?

10:33.947 --> 10:36.909
- Don't you think I know...
- Know what, Maggie?

10:37.117 --> 10:40.287
That I've gone through
this horrible transformation.

10:40.495 --> 10:42.747
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.

10:43.123 --> 10:46.501
Are you planning on meeting
Big Daddy's plane?

10:48.337 --> 10:50.088
Oh, Brick.

10:53.675 --> 10:55.635
I get so lonely.

10:56.094 --> 10:58.054
Everybody gets that.

11:00.098 --> 11:02.726
Living with somebody you love can be...

11:02.934 --> 11:05.770
lonelier than living entirely alone...

11:06.771 --> 11:09.107
when the one you love doesn't love you.

11:20.410 --> 11:23.455
You can't even stand
drinking out of the same glass, can you?

11:23.622 --> 11:24.957
Would you like to live alone?

11:25.249 --> 11:26.249
No!

11:32.297 --> 11:34.215
No, I wouldn't.

11:37.636 --> 11:40.180
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?

11:40.388 --> 11:42.474
Most drinking men lose theirs.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.267
Why can't you?

11:45.143 --> 11:49.106
I think you've even got better looking
since you went on the bottle.

11:52.275 --> 11:54.194
You were such a wonderful lover.

11:54.402 --> 11:56.112
You'll be late!

11:56.613 --> 11:59.198
You were so exciting
to be in love with.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.451
<i>Mostly, I guess, because you were...</i>

12:07.165 --> 12:08.958
If I thought you'd...

12:09.250 --> 12:12.129
never make love to me again...

12:15.257 --> 12:20.053
l'd find the longest, sharpest knife
and stick it straight into my heart.

12:20.803 --> 12:22.638
I'd do that.

12:25.934 --> 12:27.269
<i>Oh, Brick...</i>

12:27.352 --> 12:30.689
How long does this have to go on,
this punishment?

12:30.855 --> 12:33.691
Haven't I served my term?
Can I get a pardon?

12:33.858 --> 12:38.864
<i>Your finishing-school voice sounds like you
were running upstairs to say, "Fire! "</i>

12:40.740 --> 12:42.409
Is it any wonder?

12:43.284 --> 12:45.328
You know what I feel like?

12:45.536 --> 12:48.207
I feel all the time like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

12:48.373 --> 12:50.042
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.878
Cats jump off roofs and land uninjured.
Do it. Jump.

12:54.087 --> 12:55.087
Jump where?

12:55.255 --> 12:56.673
Into what?

12:56.881 --> 12:58.508
Take a lover.

13:00.802 --> 13:02.846
I don't deserve that!

13:09.227 --> 13:11.897
I can't see any man but you.

13:13.398 --> 13:16.818
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.

13:21.739 --> 13:24.076
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?

13:24.243 --> 13:28.288
Why can't you get fat or ugly or something,
so I can stand it?

13:29.539 --> 13:33.001
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.

13:33.209 --> 13:35.253
I'm more determined than you think.

13:35.462 --> 13:37.339
I'll win all right.

13:37.547 --> 13:38.924
Win what?

13:40.050 --> 13:43.762
What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

13:48.058 --> 13:50.602
Just staying on it, I guess...

13:50.769 --> 13:52.771
as long as she can.

14:04.824 --> 14:07.786
Calm down. Not yet.
Now wait a minute.

14:08.036 --> 14:09.287
Where are the flowers?

14:09.454 --> 14:11.957
Aren't you putting it on a little thick?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.060
Get ready, now!

14:32.352 --> 14:34.937
Mama, she didn't bring anything
for Big Daddy.

14:35.313 --> 14:38.692
Pretty seedy looking flowers
for Big Daddy, huh, Gooper?

14:38.900 --> 14:40.193
I picked them myself.

14:40.402 --> 14:42.320
Looks like she picked them off a grave.

14:42.487 --> 14:46.824
Don't talk about graves when we don't
know if Big Daddy's going to live or die.

14:51.913 --> 14:52.913
Get ready.

14:58.669 --> 15:00.130
Hello, Mae.

15:00.339 --> 15:01.923
Hello, children.

15:16.062 --> 15:18.106
Doc, isn't it great?

15:23.529 --> 15:24.529
Kiss me!

15:25.572 --> 15:27.407
Kiss your grandmother.

15:27.991 --> 15:29.534
Darling Big Daddy!

15:29.701 --> 15:32.162
You look fine, Big Daddy.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.997
Doc, do you want to
tell them the news?

15:35.373 --> 15:39.002
The exploratory operation proved
there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy.

15:39.211 --> 15:40.378
<i>Nothing at all!</i>

15:40.921 --> 15:43.423
<i>Just a spastic colon. And that's all.</i>

15:43.631 --> 15:46.300
- Great news!
- Isn't that great news?

15:46.426 --> 15:48.554
That's the best birthday present of all.

15:49.054 --> 15:50.138
Where's Brick?

15:50.347 --> 15:52.557
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg.

15:52.766 --> 15:54.184
- How?
- What's that?

15:54.392 --> 15:57.395
Got drunk again and tried to jump
the high hurdles at 3:00 AM.

15:57.604 --> 15:59.898
That poor boy still thinks he's an athlete.

16:00.107 --> 16:02.067
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper.

16:02.150 --> 16:03.568
AP got hold of it too.

16:03.735 --> 16:05.362
Yeah, and UP...

16:05.570 --> 16:09.407
and thanks to your professional
legal advice, every other P.

16:09.866 --> 16:11.159
Let's go home.

16:11.367 --> 16:13.537
Don't you want to ride with the children?

16:13.745 --> 16:15.080
No!

16:16.414 --> 16:19.250
He's his sassy old self again, all right!

16:19.459 --> 16:21.210
Be quiet, woman!

16:29.511 --> 16:31.012
Hush up!

16:32.639 --> 16:33.639
Hush up!

16:41.648 --> 16:43.066
Welcome home, Cap'n Pollitt.

16:51.908 --> 16:54.869
I'm going to live, Maggie.
I'm going to live.

16:55.411 --> 16:58.122
They had me real scared.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.125
I've wasted so much time.

17:00.334 --> 17:03.378
I've got a million different kinds
of feelings left in me.

17:03.587 --> 17:07.339
And I'm going to use them.
I'm going to use them all.

17:46.879 --> 17:50.384
Why did you and Brick
suddenly drive up from New Orleans?

17:50.592 --> 17:52.302
For your birthday, what else?

17:52.511 --> 17:56.181
I had one last year
and the year before. Didn't see you then.

17:56.389 --> 17:58.433
You know how Brick is sometimes.

17:58.516 --> 18:01.770
Maybe he thought
he was coming to my funeral instead.

18:01.979 --> 18:04.648
Brick loves you! He does!

18:06.566 --> 18:08.359
But does he love you?

18:09.569 --> 18:12.322
What do you want? Proof?

18:12.781 --> 18:15.075
If I was married to you
three years...

18:15.158 --> 18:17.244
you'd have the living proof.

18:17.452 --> 18:19.913
You'd have three kids
and a fourth in the oven.

18:22.707 --> 18:25.627
Get me out of this. I
want to talk to Brick.

18:32.592 --> 18:35.344
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.

18:39.349 --> 18:41.476
<i>"We love you when we're with you</i>

18:41.559 --> 18:43.144
<i>"And we love you out of sight</i>

18:43.228 --> 18:45.313
<i>"Dimmerinky-dink-a-dink
Dimmerinky-doo</i>

18:46.356 --> 18:49.151
<i>"Big Mama, too"</i>

19:01.955 --> 19:03.123
<i>Brick...</i>

19:03.248 --> 19:04.833
I've got news, honey!

19:05.041 --> 19:06.501
Big news.

19:06.751 --> 19:08.878
Big Daddy's going to live.

19:11.255 --> 19:13.800
That's right, he's a well man.

19:14.009 --> 19:17.679
That's what Big Mama said and Dr. Baugh
was right there with them.

19:17.971 --> 19:20.515
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.

19:21.057 --> 19:23.392
They almost dropped dead
from shock themselves.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.937
He's all right?

19:25.062 --> 19:26.605
Feeling like 40...

19:26.772 --> 19:28.023
<i>and talking like 20.</i>

19:28.106 --> 19:30.191
And we can drive back
to New Orleans tonight.

19:30.275 --> 19:32.485
I'm taking no chances
on moving you.

19:32.569 --> 19:33.611
I won't break.

19:33.695 --> 19:37.324
Or letting them poison
Big Daddy's mind against you.

19:37.991 --> 19:42.120
I just want you to get dressed
and come to Big Daddy's birthday party.

19:42.412 --> 19:45.748
First thing Big Daddy asked about was you.

19:45.957 --> 19:48.627
Big Daddy! Now what makes him so big?

19:49.294 --> 19:51.713
His big heart, his big belly...

19:51.922 --> 19:53.214
or his big money?

19:54.549 --> 19:56.801
The heat has made you cross.

19:56.968 --> 19:58.594
Give me my crutch.

20:01.223 --> 20:03.642
Why don't you put on
your silk pajamas, honey...

20:03.850 --> 20:05.852
and come on down to the party?

20:06.061 --> 20:08.354
There's a lovely cool breeze.

20:09.063 --> 20:10.982
Give me my crutch, Maggie.

20:12.192 --> 20:14.403
Lean on me, baby.

20:21.159 --> 20:23.912
You've got a nice smell about you.

20:25.664 --> 20:28.333
- Was your bathwater cool?
- No.

20:30.085 --> 20:33.421
I know something
that would make you cool and fresh.

20:34.338 --> 20:36.008
Alcohol rub.

20:36.675 --> 20:38.010
Cologne.

20:38.844 --> 20:40.387
No thanks. We'd smell alike.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.056
Like a couple of cats in the heat.

20:53.275 --> 20:55.026
It's cool on the lawn.

20:55.235 --> 20:59.489
I am not going down there.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy!

21:02.367 --> 21:04.327
At least give him this present...

21:04.536 --> 21:08.081
that I remembered to buy for you,
for his birthday.

21:08.706 --> 21:10.625
Just write a few words on this card.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.377
You write something.

21:12.586 --> 21:16.173
It's got to be your handwriting.
It's your present.

21:16.381 --> 21:17.799
I didn't get him a present.

21:18.008 --> 21:19.300
What's the difference?

21:19.509 --> 21:21.678
If there's no difference,
you write the card!

21:21.761 --> 21:24.723
- And have him know you didn't remember?
- I didn't remember!

21:24.890 --> 21:26.933
You don't have to prove it to him!

21:27.142 --> 21:29.311
<i>Just write, "Love, Brick"...</i>

21:29.519 --> 21:30.729
for heaven's sake!
- No.

21:30.895 --> 21:33.898
- You've got to.
- I don't have to do anything!

21:34.107 --> 21:37.361
You forget the conditions I agreed on
to stay living with you!

21:37.444 --> 21:41.573
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all!

21:49.915 --> 21:54.419
That's the first time you've raised
your voice in a long time.

21:57.213 --> 21:58.714
A crack in the stone wall?

22:04.804 --> 22:07.599
I think that's a fine sign.
Mighty fine.

22:13.313 --> 22:14.564
What did you do that for?

22:18.610 --> 22:21.279
To give us a little privacy for a while.

22:22.405 --> 22:24.324
Don't make a fool of yourself.

22:28.370 --> 22:31.122
I don't mind making a fool
of myself over you.

22:31.289 --> 22:33.875
I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.711
Feel embarrassed!

22:36.628 --> 22:37.796
<i>I can't live on this way.</i>

22:37.963 --> 22:42.050
- You agreed to accept that condition!
- I know I did, but I can't!

22:44.344 --> 22:45.553
Let go.

22:51.977 --> 22:53.770
Let go, Maggie!

23:11.705 --> 23:12.998
Son!

23:15.584 --> 23:18.294
We've got the most wonderful news
about Big Daddy!

23:18.461 --> 23:20.713
What's this door doing locked?

23:20.880 --> 23:23.007
<i>You think there's robbers in the house?</i>

23:24.176 --> 23:26.136
Brick's getting dressed, Big Mama.

23:26.344 --> 23:27.679
He's still getting dressed.

23:27.846 --> 23:31.015
It won't be the first time
I've seen Brick not dressed.

23:31.141 --> 23:32.475
<i>Open this door.</i>

23:42.610 --> 23:44.028
Brick, honey!

23:44.195 --> 23:45.988
Sweetheart, how does your leg feel?

23:46.197 --> 23:49.368
Come out of there. I want to give you
the news about Big Daddy.

23:49.534 --> 23:51.661
I told him already.

23:51.870 --> 23:53.872
I just hate locked doors in the house.

23:54.080 --> 23:57.667
I know you do
but people need privacy, don't they?

23:57.875 --> 24:00.045
No, ma'am, not in my house.

24:00.212 --> 24:03.423
What did you take this off for?
It looked so sweet on you.

24:03.548 --> 24:06.301
Not sweet enough
for Big Daddy's birthday party.

24:07.844 --> 24:08.886
Out!

24:10.388 --> 24:11.556
Out, you little monster!

24:19.189 --> 24:22.567
Mae and Gooper are so touchy
about their children.

24:22.733 --> 24:26.696
You hardly even dare suggest
there's any room for improvement.

24:26.905 --> 24:28.448
Brick, hurry on out!

24:28.657 --> 24:31.576
Shoot, Maggie, you just
don't like children.

24:31.784 --> 24:34.370
Why that's not true. I adore them.

24:34.579 --> 24:35.747
Well brought up.

24:35.914 --> 24:38.333
Why not have some, then,
and bring them up well?

24:38.417 --> 24:41.378
- Instead of picking on theirs?
- Big Mama!

24:41.586 --> 24:44.589
<i>Hugh and Betsy have got to go.
They're waiting to say goodbye.</i>

24:44.672 --> 24:47.467
I'll be right down.
Tell them to hold their horses.

24:49.094 --> 24:50.094
Where's Brick?

24:56.142 --> 24:57.685
Oh.

24:59.813 --> 25:02.607
<i>What you said about having children...</i>

25:02.774 --> 25:04.859
It's still kind of a secret, but...

25:06.486 --> 25:09.447
Shoot, Maggie! Stop playing so dumb.

25:09.739 --> 25:11.825
Is he still drinking this stuff much?

25:13.493 --> 25:16.454
- He may have had a little highball.
- Don't laugh about it.

25:16.663 --> 25:19.707
Some men stop drinking when they marry.
Others start.

25:19.916 --> 25:21.959
- He never drank before...
- That's not fair!

25:22.043 --> 25:24.630
Fair or not, I want to ask you a question.

25:25.255 --> 25:26.715
Do you make Brick happy?

25:27.883 --> 25:29.259
Well?

25:31.219 --> 25:33.054
Why don't you ask if he makes me happy?

25:33.137 --> 25:34.389
I know...

25:34.472 --> 25:35.515
It works both ways.

25:35.598 --> 25:40.020
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.

25:40.228 --> 25:43.022
- We're leaving, Big Mama.
- I'm coming!

25:43.273 --> 25:45.400
When a marriage goes on the rocks...

25:45.608 --> 25:48.320
the rocks are there, right there!

25:48.528 --> 25:49.988
Goodbye, Ida.

25:50.072 --> 25:51.698
I'm coming.

25:57.870 --> 25:59.957
That's not fair.

26:00.332 --> 26:02.250
All right, I'm coming.

26:07.005 --> 26:08.756
Is Brick here?

26:09.465 --> 26:11.844
I thought I'd check his ankle.

26:12.427 --> 26:13.845
Is it giving him much pain?

26:14.054 --> 26:17.515
You know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.

26:17.682 --> 26:21.436
Even when he had
that awful back injury in football.

26:21.561 --> 26:23.271
Brick!

26:23.396 --> 26:25.899
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.

26:26.942 --> 26:29.652
I think they're fixing
to sit down at the table.

26:34.282 --> 26:37.411
You forgot to write out the card, honey.

26:40.538 --> 26:41.623
Thanks, Doc.

26:49.006 --> 26:50.382
Can I get you something cool?

26:51.174 --> 26:52.217
No, thanks.

26:52.634 --> 26:54.427
How's the ankle?

26:57.221 --> 26:58.890
Ltches some.

26:59.724 --> 27:03.353
<i>Funny, that's the same leg
you tore a muscle in the...</i>

27:03.770 --> 27:05.063
'Bama State.

27:05.271 --> 27:06.773
Twenty-one to...

27:06.981 --> 27:07.690
Nothing.

27:07.899 --> 27:10.151
You miss football, don't you?

27:10.359 --> 27:12.237
Hurt much when you put weight on it?

27:12.404 --> 27:13.447
Some.

27:13.655 --> 27:17.283
Yeah, you were quite a team,
you and Skipper.

27:19.744 --> 27:21.412
What is it, Doc?

27:21.704 --> 27:25.125
You didn't leave that party
to come up and discuss my health.

27:25.625 --> 27:26.376
That's right.

27:26.460 --> 27:29.838
- I've already heard the good news...
- It's bad news.

27:29.921 --> 27:31.965
It's what we expected.

27:32.340 --> 27:34.550
It's malignant and it's terminal.

27:34.759 --> 27:36.720
<i>He hasn't a chance.</i>

27:36.928 --> 27:40.015
- But Maggie said, and Big Mama...
- Lies.

27:40.599 --> 27:41.891
<i>I lied to them.</i>

27:42.851 --> 27:45.144
I lied to him, too.

27:46.479 --> 27:47.480
Professional ethics.

27:49.274 --> 27:49.816
Gooper?

27:50.025 --> 27:52.652
I told him the truth
coming in from the airfield.

27:53.278 --> 27:54.487
He's going to die.

27:56.364 --> 27:57.907
He's going to die.

28:06.791 --> 28:09.961
<i>"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam"</i>

28:12.714 --> 28:15.133
What kind of truth is that?

28:34.485 --> 28:37.531
<i>"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam</i>

28:37.739 --> 28:40.283
<i>"To shine for him each day</i>

28:41.701 --> 28:44.829
<i>"ln every way try to please him</i>

28:45.038 --> 28:47.665
<i>"At home, at school, at play</i>

28:48.500 --> 28:50.001
<i>"A sunbeam</i>

28:52.254 --> 28:55.173
<i>"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam</i>

28:55.673 --> 28:58.384
<i>"A sunbeam, a sunbeam</i>

28:58.843 --> 29:01.680
<i>"I'll be a sunbeam for him"</i>

29:01.972 --> 29:03.348
Amen!

29:03.473 --> 29:06.768
- Did you like the singing?
- Pass the black-eyed peas.

29:06.893 --> 29:10.605
Look at Big Daddy eat!
Ain't it something to thank your stars for?

29:10.772 --> 29:13.108
They've been practicing just for you.

29:13.191 --> 29:14.443
Tell them to sit and eat.

29:14.526 --> 29:16.486
- Children, come on.
- Over there!

29:16.695 --> 29:18.696
Yeah. Over there.

29:19.572 --> 29:21.032
Look here. Telegrams!

29:21.115 --> 29:23.868
Hundreds of them from every corner
of this great state...

29:23.994 --> 29:25.579
Wishing you happy birthday.

29:25.704 --> 29:27.664
- Shall I read them?
- No!

29:27.747 --> 29:29.624
One from the governor and the senator...

29:29.708 --> 29:32.877
It must be getting on to election time,
hey, Deacon?

29:33.044 --> 29:35.755
Let's remember,
we're all lambs in the same pasture.

29:35.964 --> 29:39.885
Everybody, including Big Daddy,
owes thanks to those in high places who...

29:40.093 --> 29:41.219
Gave us nothing!

29:41.386 --> 29:45.431
Every scrap on this table was raised
right here on this place, Deacon.

29:45.640 --> 29:50.020
I made a pastureland out of this place
when it was nothing but a swamp.

29:50.228 --> 29:53.440
And it was done with the help of God,
and not any governor.

29:53.523 --> 29:54.232
Amen.

29:54.315 --> 29:56.859
<i>"Boom, boom and it makes me crazy"</i>

29:56.943 --> 29:58.236
Great balls of fire!

29:58.444 --> 29:59.654
Surprise!

29:59.862 --> 30:02.908
- What are they up to now?
- It's part of the entertainment.

30:03.074 --> 30:04.993
Don't they get any intermission?

30:05.201 --> 30:06.744
That's funny!

30:07.245 --> 30:08.663
That's very funny!

30:08.871 --> 30:11.123
He don't mean it, Sister Woman.

30:11.249 --> 30:13.960
- He loves children!
- Of course he does!

30:14.086 --> 30:16.087
Will you put some honey on this?

30:16.296 --> 30:19.424
They're all Pollitts,
I'm proud to say, every one of them.

30:19.632 --> 30:22.343
I know Big Daddy's
just as proud as we are...

30:22.552 --> 30:24.763
that there's a
flesh-and-blood dynasty...

30:24.930 --> 30:27.182
waiting to take over.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.476
That's no way to talk.

30:29.684 --> 30:30.684
What way?

30:30.727 --> 30:34.772
<i>"Take over." When we all know...</i>

30:34.981 --> 30:37.442
Big Daddy's going to live
to be at least 100.

30:37.526 --> 30:39.152
I'll drink to that!

30:39.528 --> 30:41.696
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!

30:41.905 --> 30:43.406
To Big Daddy!

30:45.158 --> 30:48.203
In the name of every person
in this county...

30:48.287 --> 30:51.831
in the name of the church
and school board, the board of trustees...

30:51.915 --> 30:54.709
felicitations on your 65th birthday.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.212
Brick, honey,
I brought you something to eat.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.965
I'm not hungry.

31:03.468 --> 31:05.512
What's that supposed to mean?

31:05.720 --> 31:06.971
We're leaving.

31:07.096 --> 31:08.848
- We can't.
- I can.

31:08.973 --> 31:12.603
- The party's coming up here to you.
- I'll get one of the boys to drive me.

31:12.728 --> 31:16.523
You just can't walk out
on Big Daddy's birthday party!

31:16.731 --> 31:18.441
Don't you care nothing about him?

31:18.525 --> 31:19.984
Get out of my way.

31:21.152 --> 31:23.529
Get out of my way, Maggie!

31:26.116 --> 31:27.993
You've got no cause to dislike him.

31:30.328 --> 31:31.704
Do I dislike him?

31:31.913 --> 31:35.958
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.756
What's he ever done to you?

31:41.965 --> 31:43.007
What?

31:43.216 --> 31:45.468
Why do you hate him so much?

31:45.843 --> 31:47.261
What's he ever done to you?

31:51.183 --> 31:52.183
Nothing.

31:53.518 --> 31:56.062
What was Dr. Baugh doing up here?

31:57.480 --> 31:59.190
What did he...

32:03.862 --> 32:06.156
That's right. Big Daddy is going to die.

32:09.409 --> 32:11.702
I don't believe that.

32:12.162 --> 32:15.123
Dr. Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.

32:15.332 --> 32:16.666
Wouldn't he, Maggie?

32:21.504 --> 32:23.548
Poor Big Daddy.

32:24.716 --> 32:26.635
I'm fond of him.

32:26.843 --> 32:29.554
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.

32:29.846 --> 32:31.806
I really am, you know.

32:33.307 --> 32:35.434
<i>When he finds out...</i>

32:36.436 --> 32:38.897
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.

32:41.274 --> 32:42.817
That's why you want to go now.

32:44.444 --> 32:47.029
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.

32:49.741 --> 32:51.952
You've got to do this for me, Maggie.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.579
And leave the field to Gooper and his wife?

32:54.746 --> 32:55.747
No, sir!

32:55.955 --> 32:57.540
Let's face facts, baby.

32:57.749 --> 32:59.500
You're a drinker. That takes money.

32:59.709 --> 33:01.044
I don't want his money!

33:01.253 --> 33:03.255
Are you ready to settle for ten-cent beer?

33:03.338 --> 33:06.508
That's what Gooper'll dole out to you
when they freeze you out.

33:06.716 --> 33:08.968
They've got a plan, baby.

33:09.177 --> 33:13.682
You should've heard them
laying it on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute!

33:13.890 --> 33:16.434
Big Mama's already on their side.

33:16.935 --> 33:20.063
You're a drinker and I'm childless.

33:20.772 --> 33:24.359
We've got to beat that plan,
we've just got to!

33:27.404 --> 33:28.947
I've been so...

33:29.114 --> 33:32.283
disgustingly poor all my life.

33:32.909 --> 33:35.203
That's the truth, Brick.

33:36.330 --> 33:38.290
Have you, Maggie?

33:40.417 --> 33:42.293
You don't know what it's like to have to...

33:42.418 --> 33:45.797
suck up to people you can't stand,
just because they have money.

33:46.881 --> 33:49.051
You don't know what it's like...

33:49.259 --> 33:51.386
never having any clothes.

33:52.387 --> 33:54.556
That dress I married you in...

33:54.764 --> 33:58.851
was a hand-me-down
from a snotty, rich cousin I hated.

34:00.979 --> 34:03.315
You can be young without money.

34:04.482 --> 34:06.818
But you can't be old without it.

34:09.362 --> 34:11.531
Where did I fail you?

34:12.114 --> 34:14.451
Where did I make my mistake?

34:15.994 --> 34:18.329
Make that your last drink
until after the party...

34:18.413 --> 34:19.914
<i>please, honey.</i>

34:26.838 --> 34:30.007
I think I made my mistake
when I tried to tell you about Skipper.

34:30.341 --> 34:32.217
- That's my fatal error.
- Maggie!

34:32.427 --> 34:34.637
- I never should...
- Shut up about Skipper!

34:34.846 --> 34:36.723
I mean it! Shut up!

34:36.931 --> 34:39.601
The laws of silence won't work about that!

34:39.809 --> 34:41.728
Not about Skipper and us.

34:41.936 --> 34:45.815
It's like locking the door on a fire
to forget the house is burning.

34:45.898 --> 34:47.315
Hey, everybody!

34:48.694 --> 34:51.821
But not looking at a fire
doesn't put it out.

34:52.072 --> 34:56.909
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper...

34:56.993 --> 34:58.578
I don't want to hear about it!

34:58.828 --> 35:01.540
Why won't you face the truth, just once...

35:01.706 --> 35:04.876
about Skipper, about me, about yourself?

35:04.959 --> 35:06.002
Hey, everybody!

35:06.127 --> 35:08.212
Are you bringing that party up here or not?

35:08.379 --> 35:10.256
Kit and caboodle, son.

35:10.465 --> 35:12.926
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this...

35:13.135 --> 35:16.054
and I don't care if
it's in front of them.

35:17.806 --> 35:19.766
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?

35:19.849 --> 35:21.934
Are you still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

35:22.018 --> 35:23.686
I could kill you with this crutch.

35:23.894 --> 35:26.148
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?

35:26.356 --> 35:29.317
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Why won't you let it alone?

35:29.401 --> 35:31.736
- It's got to be told!
- I don't want to hear it!

35:31.945 --> 35:35.323
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you...

35:35.531 --> 35:38.285
and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!

35:38.493 --> 35:40.078
- Skipper was no good!
- Maggie!

35:40.287 --> 35:41.704
Maybe I'm no good.

35:41.913 --> 35:43.122
Nobody's good.

35:43.331 --> 35:45.708
But Skipper is dead!

35:46.083 --> 35:47.919
- And I'm alive!
- Maggie!

35:48.085 --> 35:50.046
Maggie the cat is alive!

35:50.255 --> 35:51.631
I'm alive!

35:51.840 --> 35:53.842
Why are you afraid of the truth?

35:54.050 --> 35:55.093
Truth?

36:02.851 --> 36:06.688
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you...

36:06.896 --> 36:09.690
to knock before you open a door.

36:09.899 --> 36:14.446
Otherwise, people might think
you're lacking in good breeding.

36:15.905 --> 36:17.991
Nyah nyah nyah!

36:18.074 --> 36:21.077
What's Uncle Brick doing
on the floor?

36:22.203 --> 36:24.456
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie...

36:27.792 --> 36:29.127
but I failed...

36:29.878 --> 36:33.881
and I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

36:39.095 --> 36:42.056
What were you jumping
high hurdles for?

36:42.515 --> 36:46.394
Because I used to, and people like to do
what they used to do...

36:47.103 --> 36:49.815
after they've stopped
being able to do it.

36:49.981 --> 36:53.401
That's right. And that's your answer.

36:53.693 --> 36:54.861
Now go away.

36:56.279 --> 36:59.532
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

36:59.740 --> 37:04.162
You're just jealous
because you can't have babies.

37:13.338 --> 37:14.589
You see?

37:16.132 --> 37:20.094
Mae and Gooper gloat over us
being childless...

37:21.429 --> 37:24.891
even in front of their little
no-neck monsters.

37:30.522 --> 37:33.149
I went to a doctor in Memphis.

37:33.524 --> 37:35.693
A gynecologist.

37:36.862 --> 37:40.573
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child...

37:40.782 --> 37:42.784
whenever we want.

37:46.412 --> 37:47.496
Brick?

37:49.875 --> 37:53.378
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

37:54.838 --> 37:58.216
But how in hell do you imagine
you're going to have a child...

37:58.382 --> 38:01.011
by a man who cannot stand you?

38:09.102 --> 38:11.229
That, boy of mine...

38:12.522 --> 38:15.984
is a problem I'll just have to work out.

38:16.192 --> 38:18.695
Here comes that party, here we come!

38:18.903 --> 38:21.823
Here comes that birthday party!

38:22.115 --> 38:23.741
That's nice.

38:25.660 --> 38:27.329
The preacher almost cried...

38:27.412 --> 38:30.165
when I told him
I got a stained-glass memorial window.

38:30.248 --> 38:31.916
Who gave you that window?

38:32.000 --> 38:35.294
Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a generous woman of fine character.

38:35.378 --> 38:38.131
What someone should give our church
is a cooling system.

38:38.215 --> 38:39.674
Yes, sir. Exactly my thought.

38:39.758 --> 38:43.303
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots...

38:43.511 --> 38:48.140
diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

38:49.768 --> 38:52.812
Gooper, what have all the kiddies
been shot for?

38:53.021 --> 38:55.189
Everything but stealing chickens.

39:02.822 --> 39:03.865
Well, Brick?

39:04.574 --> 39:06.868
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

39:07.076 --> 39:08.411
Bull!

39:08.494 --> 39:10.913
Guess what memorial
Gus's family gave?

39:11.122 --> 39:13.708
- A new house and basketball court...
- Deacon!

39:14.626 --> 39:17.879
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

39:18.087 --> 39:20.965
Figuring on somebody kicking off
around here?

39:21.215 --> 39:24.970
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

39:28.682 --> 39:30.934
Turn that damn thing off!

39:32.977 --> 39:34.687
Where's my Brick?

39:34.770 --> 39:37.524
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.

39:37.649 --> 39:39.901
How does your leg feel, honey?

39:39.985 --> 39:43.613
Your hand was made for holding
something better! Put that liquor down.

39:43.821 --> 39:47.116
- He is putting it down, all right!
- Turn that off!

39:47.199 --> 39:49.995
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

39:54.749 --> 39:59.629
Hey, everybody, you know the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

39:59.837 --> 40:01.798
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

40:02.507 --> 40:06.594
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper...

40:06.803 --> 40:09.972
<i>and Big Daddy said,
"That's my kid, ain't it? "</i>

40:10.181 --> 40:12.517
It was kind of funny.
I'd never had a beau...

40:12.684 --> 40:15.437
<i>till I met your father.
He said, "I want that kid.</i>

40:15.645 --> 40:16.938
<i>"I need him.</i>

40:17.147 --> 40:21.526
<i>"He ain't going to have nobody else's name
but mine. Let's get the preacher.</i>

40:21.692 --> 40:24.236
<i>"That's what marriage is for. Family."</i>

40:25.363 --> 40:28.199
<i>Children were mighty important
to Big Daddy, even then.</i>

40:28.366 --> 40:30.702
Ida, will you stop
that yammering?

40:30.827 --> 40:33.871
That's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.833
I've been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

40:37.292 --> 40:39.211
Ida, will you keep quiet?

40:40.170 --> 40:41.838
Children, come on!

40:46.509 --> 40:49.638
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!

40:52.599 --> 40:55.560
<i>"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow</i>

40:55.768 --> 40:58.187
<i>"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow</i>

40:59.438 --> 41:02.025
<i>"And so is Big Mama, too</i>

41:08.448 --> 41:11.909
<i>"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow</i>

41:13.036 --> 41:16.414
<i>"And so is Big Mama, too"</i>

41:18.500 --> 41:22.003
- What's wrong with you?
- She's just so happy.

41:22.920 --> 41:27.342
I'm so happy.
I've just got to cry or something.

41:28.259 --> 41:30.261
Big Daddy's 100 percent...

41:30.470 --> 41:31.596
<i>healthy!</i>

41:31.721 --> 41:33.181
<i>Brick, honey...</i>

41:33.556 --> 41:36.267
Aren't you going to give Big Daddy
his birthday present?

41:44.734 --> 41:47.194
You can open up
your birthday present.

41:47.278 --> 41:50.448
You open it. I want to talk to Brick.
Brick, come over here.

41:50.782 --> 41:53.034
Big Daddy's calling you.

41:53.243 --> 41:55.954
Big Mama, take them out for me.

41:56.162 --> 41:59.957
- It's a cashmere robe!
- You sound surprised.

42:00.166 --> 42:04.504
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny!

42:05.255 --> 42:06.839
What's so funny about it?

42:07.465 --> 42:09.634
All my family ever had was family.

42:10.676 --> 42:11.802
Quiet!

42:12.011 --> 42:15.265
- You bought it yourself last Saturday.
- I said quiet!

42:15.473 --> 42:19.727
The salesgirl that sold it to you
waited on me and she told me about it.

42:19.936 --> 42:21.729
- Sister Woman!
- Quiet!

42:21.938 --> 42:24.399
- Stork and the Grim Reaper, neck and neck.
- Deacon!

42:24.483 --> 42:25.567
Deacon!

42:26.568 --> 42:31.114
I'm not butting in on more talk about
memorial stained-glass windows, am I?

42:31.614 --> 42:33.157
Not at all.

42:34.158 --> 42:36.953
What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

42:37.871 --> 42:39.956
I love humanity. That's my reward.

42:40.165 --> 42:43.126
And if humanity returns your love,
you might get elected...

42:43.209 --> 42:45.044
councilman or mayor, hey, Deacon?

42:45.253 --> 42:46.879
Don't start picking on Deacon.

42:46.963 --> 42:50.133
- That's all right. I was...
- Good night, Deacon.

42:50.217 --> 42:54.053
That's exactly what I was about to say.
I better go before it starts raining.

42:54.137 --> 42:57.765
Good night, everybody.
Bless each and every one in this place.

42:59.016 --> 43:02.354
They tell me you were indulging in
some athletics last night.

43:02.562 --> 43:05.732
- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

43:06.191 --> 43:10.111
What were you doing on
the high school athletic field at 3:00 AM?

43:10.194 --> 43:14.991
I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.

43:15.283 --> 43:17.160
Because you were drunk!

43:17.243 --> 43:20.330
Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

43:20.705 --> 43:22.957
It's time to blow out the candles!

43:23.374 --> 43:25.919
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt...

43:26.127 --> 43:28.963
on his 65th birthday.

43:29.172 --> 43:32.717
- To the biggest cotton planter...
- I told you, quit this bull!

43:32.842 --> 43:36.012
I won't let you talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

43:36.095 --> 43:39.808
I'll talk like I want to
on my birthday, or any other rotten day.

43:39.891 --> 43:42.810
Anybody don't like it,
they know what they can do about it.

43:42.894 --> 43:46.022
- I know you don't mean that.
- You don't know nothing, never did.

43:46.105 --> 43:49.776
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.

43:51.111 --> 43:55.198
I've put up with a lot of bull around here
because I thought I was dying.

43:55.406 --> 43:57.825
That's when you started taking over.

43:58.034 --> 44:02.414
Your loud voice and busybody butting in
here and there and everywhere.

44:02.581 --> 44:06.459
Sashaying around here,
making a big noise like a boss.

44:06.668 --> 44:09.170
I'm the only boss around here.

44:09.587 --> 44:12.591
<i>I built this place with no help from you.</i>

44:12.758 --> 44:15.760
<i>And I'll run this place till the day I die.</i>

44:15.969 --> 44:19.639
<i>Is that plain to you, Ida?
Is that perfectly clear to you?</i>

44:19.847 --> 44:21.057
<i>I ain't going to die.</i>

44:21.599 --> 44:24.770
Ain't nothing wrong with me
but a spastic colon!

44:25.353 --> 44:28.356
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars...

44:28.565 --> 44:30.984
l've had to put up with around here.

44:31.192 --> 44:35.821
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with
these 40 years I've lived with you.

44:36.948 --> 44:38.950
Now blow out them candles.

44:39.951 --> 44:43.037
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

44:45.456 --> 44:47.541
<i>Oh, Big Daddy...</i>

44:47.833 --> 44:52.505
In all these years
you never believed I loved you.

44:55.216 --> 44:56.759
And I did.

44:58.302 --> 45:00.137
I did so much.

45:01.306 --> 45:02.849
I did love you.

45:04.309 --> 45:08.354
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

45:14.653 --> 45:17.822
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- Lf he should die before...

45:18.615 --> 45:19.949
Excuse me.

45:22.994 --> 45:24.538
Brick!

45:25.247 --> 45:26.540
<i>Son!</i>

45:30.752 --> 45:32.503
I was calling Brick.

45:33.671 --> 45:36.215
I was just delivering him to you.

45:48.310 --> 45:51.064
- What did you do that for?
- Do what?

45:52.524 --> 45:54.025
Wipe off her kiss?

45:57.278 --> 45:58.446
Did I?

45:58.571 --> 46:01.074
Your woman's got
a better shape on her...

46:01.283 --> 46:02.867
than Gooper's got on his.

46:03.410 --> 46:07.789
- Is that the only difference you've noticed?
- Difference in shape is pretty important.

46:07.997 --> 46:10.791
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?

46:11.000 --> 46:14.004
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

46:14.296 --> 46:16.339
They're a couple of cats...

46:16.589 --> 46:20.843
sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres
of land. That's a lot of land.

46:21.219 --> 46:25.682
They're both squaring off, determined
to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.436
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise
for them babies.

46:29.644 --> 46:33.106
I ain't letting go for a long time yet,
if they're waiting for that.

46:33.189 --> 46:37.027
You just sit tight and let them
scratch each other's eyes out.

46:37.235 --> 46:38.653
You bet your life.

46:39.237 --> 46:43.032
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

46:43.241 --> 46:45.743
<i>Five head of them already
and more coming.</i>

46:47.078 --> 46:50.498
<i>6- 0. She'll probably
drop a litter next time.</i>

46:52.709 --> 46:55.795
- Are you stuck out there?
- I was just passing by.

46:55.878 --> 46:57.797
You were just sneaking and spying.

46:57.880 --> 47:01.676
Do I have to lock all the doors around here
to have a private conversation?

47:01.885 --> 47:04.888
- Why hurt those that really love you?
- Bull!

47:05.138 --> 47:07.598
I'm going to move you and Gooper
out of that room.

47:07.765 --> 47:11.352
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.231
I hate sneaking and spying!
It makes me puke!

47:19.360 --> 47:20.695
They listen, do they?

47:20.945 --> 47:22.780
Yeah, they listen.

47:22.989 --> 47:25.909
They run and tell Big Mama
everything they hear.

47:26.034 --> 47:29.746
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?

47:30.163 --> 47:33.791
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!
What are you doing now?

47:33.875 --> 47:35.584
Freshening up my drink.

47:35.668 --> 47:38.713
- You've a real liquor problem.
- Yes, sir.

47:38.797 --> 47:41.549
Is that why you quit
sports announcing?

47:41.633 --> 47:43.885
I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

47:44.093 --> 47:46.053
Don't guess! It's too important!

47:46.596 --> 47:48.264
So you quit.

47:49.141 --> 47:51.935
- Some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?

47:52.018 --> 47:54.812
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

47:59.317 --> 48:02.862
Do you think a shot of that whisky
would injure my spastic condition?

48:05.115 --> 48:06.407
No, sir.

48:07.617 --> 48:09.535
It might do it some good.

48:17.001 --> 48:19.170
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!

48:19.379 --> 48:21.214
That's the way to feel.

48:26.511 --> 48:28.304
I can breathe.

48:29.681 --> 48:32.475
All my life I've been
like a doubled-up fist...

48:32.683 --> 48:35.519
pounding and smashing and driving!

48:36.187 --> 48:38.982
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

48:40.859 --> 48:42.318
Do you know what I'm thinking?

48:42.402 --> 48:43.903
What's that, sir?

48:44.195 --> 48:45.363
Pleasure!

48:47.615 --> 48:51.244
I'll tell you, I still have a
feeling for women, and I'm 65.

48:51.453 --> 48:53.913
- That's mighty remarkable.
- Remarkable?

48:54.539 --> 48:55.540
Admirable.

48:55.748 --> 49:00.127
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

49:00.336 --> 49:03.381
- I'm going to have me a ball.
- A ball?

49:03.590 --> 49:05.383
I'm going to pick me a choice woman...

49:05.467 --> 49:09.345
and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

49:09.554 --> 49:11.347
I'm going to be happy!

49:13.683 --> 49:16.644
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

49:16.728 --> 49:18.271
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

49:19.981 --> 49:22.567
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?

49:22.775 --> 49:25.278
<i>- A click in my head.
- Did you say, "click"?</i>

49:25.403 --> 49:29.324
Yes, sir. That click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

49:29.532 --> 49:31.701
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

49:33.077 --> 49:37.833
Like a switch clicking off in my head. Turns
the hot light off and the cool one on.

49:37.916 --> 49:39.793
All of a sudden, there's peace.

49:42.295 --> 49:44.505
You're a real alcoholic!

49:45.923 --> 49:47.258
That is the truth.

49:47.466 --> 49:51.429
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

49:51.554 --> 49:54.682
- No, I won't!
- I'm waiting for that click...

49:54.766 --> 49:58.686
and I don't get it unless I'm alone!
I'm not talking. When it's quiet!

49:58.769 --> 50:02.983
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.

50:03.191 --> 50:06.653
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

50:07.654 --> 50:12.158
- Let it be painful.
- I can crawl and hop if I have to.

50:13.118 --> 50:18.414
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out
this family and be drinking on skid row.

50:18.498 --> 50:20.166
Yeah, that will come too.

50:20.750 --> 50:24.755
No. Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm going to straighten you out.

50:24.838 --> 50:26.256
Sit down!

50:26.464 --> 50:30.385
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

50:36.975 --> 50:40.103
- Where are you going?
- To get another bottle.

50:40.311 --> 50:42.730
No, you're not,
you drunken whelp!

50:44.565 --> 50:48.486
Why are you shouting?
I can't stand it!

50:48.695 --> 50:51.948
Get out of here!
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?

50:52.824 --> 50:55.743
You had better know
why you drink or give it up!

50:56.369 --> 50:57.662
Give me my crutch.

50:57.870 --> 50:58.704
Why do you drink?

50:58.788 --> 51:00.916
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.

51:01.124 --> 51:02.417
Good!

51:08.548 --> 51:11.217
At least you're not too numb...

51:11.300 --> 51:14.012
with liquor to feel pain.

51:15.930 --> 51:18.016
- Why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.

51:18.224 --> 51:21.394
- Tell me first.
- No, give me a drink first.

51:21.519 --> 51:23.062
Tell me first.

51:24.021 --> 51:26.983
- First you've got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!

51:27.192 --> 51:30.320
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.

51:30.528 --> 51:35.157
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

51:39.245 --> 51:41.456
What are you disgusted with?

51:42.248 --> 51:45.543
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!

51:45.710 --> 51:48.003
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?

51:48.212 --> 51:50.548
No, not one lie or one person.
The whole thing.

51:50.715 --> 51:52.592
- You got a headache?
- No, I'm trying...

51:52.801 --> 51:56.679
Trying to concentrate, but you can't
because your brain is soaked with liquor.

51:56.888 --> 51:58.014
Wet brain!

51:59.056 --> 52:00.433
Mendacity!

52:00.641 --> 52:04.562
<i>What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.</i>

52:04.771 --> 52:08.649
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her! Gooper?

52:08.733 --> 52:09.859
Get out of there!

52:10.234 --> 52:12.988
<i>Go on. Close the door after you.</i>

52:13.196 --> 52:14.196
Mendacity!

52:14.489 --> 52:19.369
Look at the lies I've got to put up with.
Pretenses, hypocrisy!

52:19.577 --> 52:24.040
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.

52:24.665 --> 52:28.503
Church! It bores me, but I go.

52:28.795 --> 52:33.257
All those swindling lodges, social clubs,
and money-grabbing auxiliaries...

52:33.424 --> 52:35.926
that's got me on their number one
sucker list.

52:36.093 --> 52:40.306
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?

52:40.515 --> 52:45.394
You've got to. There's nothing to live with
but mendacity. Is there?

52:46.437 --> 52:48.606
Yes, sir, you can live with this.

52:51.609 --> 52:52.652
That's not living.

52:54.153 --> 52:57.281
- That's dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.

52:57.365 --> 52:58.950
Then why not kill yourself?

52:59.075 --> 53:00.744
Because I like to drink.

53:00.869 --> 53:02.454
I can't talk to you!

53:02.662 --> 53:03.830
I'm sorry.

53:03.955 --> 53:07.125
Do you expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land...

53:07.250 --> 53:09.961
this side of the Nile to a drunk fool?
- No, sir.

53:10.127 --> 53:13.465
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior?

53:13.673 --> 53:15.508
Give it to Gooper and Mae.

53:15.717 --> 53:19.595
I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

53:20.972 --> 53:23.724
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!

53:23.933 --> 53:28.021
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

53:28.229 --> 53:30.982
I can wait and see
if you pull yourself together or not.

53:31.065 --> 53:32.316
That's right.

53:32.859 --> 53:36.404
- I'm not kidding.
- No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

53:36.822 --> 53:37.906
You don't care?

53:38.114 --> 53:40.158
No, sir, I don't care.

53:41.409 --> 53:43.077
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.

53:43.161 --> 53:46.038
- Now wait a minute!
- Or I'll drive myself.

53:46.122 --> 53:47.790
I'm going home tonight. Now!

53:47.915 --> 53:50.335
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?

53:51.503 --> 53:53.505
Let's not leave it like this.

53:53.755 --> 53:56.340
Like all them other talks we've had.

53:56.549 --> 53:59.969
We always seem to talk around things.

54:00.344 --> 54:04.099
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

54:04.390 --> 54:07.935
- Now we've got to talk straight.
- It's too late for talk.

54:08.144 --> 54:09.270
Why?

54:09.478 --> 54:11.355
What are you disgusted about?

54:11.814 --> 54:14.651
Because you can't play football anymore?

54:15.026 --> 54:18.363
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!

54:24.368 --> 54:28.039
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

54:28.248 --> 54:31.709
Describing what I can't do
while others do it?

54:32.919 --> 54:37.674
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can
stand it? You'll get that back for me?

54:38.091 --> 54:40.260
I think you're passing the buck.

54:43.179 --> 54:44.555
Do you know many drinking men?

54:44.722 --> 54:46.307
I've known a good number.

54:46.515 --> 54:48.684
Could any of them they tell you
why they drank?

54:48.768 --> 54:50.478
You're passing the buck?

54:50.687 --> 54:54.524
You're passing the buck
to things like disgust and mendacity.

54:54.732 --> 54:56.901
If you've got to use
that kind of language...

54:57.068 --> 55:00.237
it's 90 proof bull
and I ain't buying any!

55:00.404 --> 55:05.577
You started drinking with your friend
Skipper's death. Ain't that the truth?

55:14.669 --> 55:16.004
What are you suggesting?

55:17.088 --> 55:18.089
Nothing. But...

55:18.298 --> 55:19.590
But what?

55:19.757 --> 55:20.800
Say your mind.

55:21.175 --> 55:22.385
Say it!

55:22.468 --> 55:25.388
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead, say it!

55:25.514 --> 55:26.973
Why are you shouting like that?

55:27.057 --> 55:29.100
Skipper and I were friends, understand?

55:29.267 --> 55:30.768
Gooper said that Skipper was...

55:30.852 --> 55:33.813
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

55:33.896 --> 55:35.564
And you drag it through the gutter!

55:35.648 --> 55:38.276
- Just a minute!
- You make it shameful and filthy!

55:48.244 --> 55:49.538
Give me your hand.

55:52.248 --> 55:55.668
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!

55:56.294 --> 55:58.963
Didn't you ever look up to anybody?

55:59.130 --> 56:00.924
<i>Anybody at all in your whole life?</i>

56:01.133 --> 56:03.968
<i>Didn't you ever believe in anything,
anybody?</i>

56:05.303 --> 56:08.181
No, sir, I guess you didn't.

56:08.514 --> 56:11.767
Nothing and nobody
except Big Daddy himself.

56:11.976 --> 56:14.062
You and Skipper played football together.

56:14.145 --> 56:16.815
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

56:16.940 --> 56:17.982
I could depend on him.

56:18.066 --> 56:21.485
- On the football field!
- Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!

56:21.569 --> 56:23.779
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

56:23.904 --> 56:25.115
Bull!

56:25.240 --> 56:28.576
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

56:29.160 --> 56:30.828
<i>Why did Skipper crack up?</i>

56:32.455 --> 56:33.748
All right.

56:34.915 --> 56:37.586
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

56:38.670 --> 56:41.089
That straight, true talk.

56:41.339 --> 56:42.840
It's too late to stop now.

56:43.049 --> 56:44.550
Can you say it without a drink?

56:44.634 --> 56:47.303
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.

56:47.511 --> 56:51.683
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.

56:51.891 --> 56:53.768
What else do you need?

56:53.977 --> 56:54.977
Skipper?

56:55.019 --> 56:57.522
He was a crutch for you too,
wasn't he?

56:57.647 --> 56:58.689
Yes, sir.

56:58.856 --> 57:01.484
I could lean on him, in
school and out of it.

57:02.277 --> 57:06.030
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

57:08.866 --> 57:09.866
Ask her.

57:09.951 --> 57:10.951
I'm asking you.

57:11.118 --> 57:14.623
If you want to know why Skipper
cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.

57:14.748 --> 57:16.291
What did she do?

57:16.416 --> 57:19.711
Chase him out of the window
of that Chicago hotel?

57:19.877 --> 57:23.506
Did that little bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

57:24.173 --> 57:25.258
<i>Why?</i>

57:26.384 --> 57:28.553
What went on
between Skipper and Maggie?

57:30.013 --> 57:31.013
Ask her.

57:36.102 --> 57:37.646
Maggie, come here.

57:37.729 --> 57:40.440
Can I be of assistance, Big Daddy?

57:44.026 --> 57:46.570
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you!

57:46.779 --> 57:49.032
Go ahead, play.

57:57.039 --> 58:00.084
What was going on
between you and Skipper?

58:02.087 --> 58:04.089
<i>Well, you see, Big Daddy...</i>

58:06.090 --> 58:07.300
Well?

58:08.551 --> 58:10.428
Come on, Maggie!

58:10.636 --> 58:12.763
You wanted to talk truth upstairs.

58:12.931 --> 58:14.432
Go ahead!

58:14.599 --> 58:17.268
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

58:22.607 --> 58:24.358
Skipper didn't like me.

58:24.567 --> 58:26.611
Why didn't Skipper like you?

58:26.820 --> 58:29.489
- You know he was against our marriage.
- Why?

58:29.697 --> 58:33.451
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what?

58:33.618 --> 58:36.162
Freedom to run from town to town.

58:36.370 --> 58:38.623
Planes, trains, always running!

58:38.790 --> 58:43.086
- Football practice, dirty stories...
- Nobody forced you to come along with us!

58:43.294 --> 58:47.173
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

58:47.381 --> 58:51.011
Since when did a man's smell
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

58:51.219 --> 58:52.720
Football, baby!

58:52.929 --> 58:55.306
The idea of football smelled.

58:55.473 --> 58:58.434
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

58:58.643 --> 59:00.895
He didn't need any team of his own.

59:01.104 --> 59:04.607
<i>He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.</i>

59:05.650 --> 59:08.152
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

59:08.361 --> 59:09.654
You're a liar!

59:09.737 --> 59:11.864
He wasn't good enough on his own.

59:12.073 --> 59:14.409
Professional football is a business...

59:14.618 --> 59:15.660
not a social club!

59:16.369 --> 59:18.413
You mean the business of making money?

59:18.621 --> 59:21.207
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

59:21.707 --> 59:24.502
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!

59:24.668 --> 59:27.088
<i>Not from the first day to the last.</i>

59:27.297 --> 59:29.424
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

59:29.632 --> 59:31.092
He lapped them up.

59:31.300 --> 59:34.929
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

59:35.137 --> 59:37.974
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

59:38.183 --> 59:40.477
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

59:40.685 --> 59:42.478
By the man I worshiped.

59:42.687 --> 59:45.064
That's why I hated Skipper.

59:45.815 --> 59:49.486
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

01:00:00.371 --> 01:00:02.207
Is that true?

01:00:07.336 --> 01:00:09.088
<i>Oh, Big Daddy...</i>

01:00:09.922 --> 01:00:13.802
You don't think I ravished a football hero?

01:00:17.055 --> 01:00:18.723
Skipper was drunk.

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:21.184
So are you most of the time.

01:00:21.392 --> 01:00:24.145
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.607
<i>Are you...</i>

01:00:28.316 --> 01:00:31.527
Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

01:00:31.652 --> 01:00:34.322
- You know what happened.
- I don't know!

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.365
I wasn't there.

01:00:36.574 --> 01:00:39.452
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

01:00:39.661 --> 01:00:41.704
- I was in the hospital...
- Skipper played.

01:00:41.788 --> 01:00:43.206
He played all right!

01:00:43.414 --> 01:00:45.625
<i>His first professional game without Brick.</i>

01:00:47.668 --> 01:00:49.838
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.548
Go on, tell him.

01:00:51.756 --> 01:00:53.675
You're a sports announcer.

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:58.220
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

01:00:58.429 --> 01:01:01.349
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:04.102
and stumbled and fell apart.

01:01:04.435 --> 01:01:08.481
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

01:01:08.689 --> 01:01:10.107
And it was all over:

01:01:10.274 --> 01:01:13.320
0.

01:01:13.528 --> 01:01:15.155
Bad breaks. An off day.

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.364
No, baby.

01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:19.617
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

01:01:19.784 --> 01:01:21.953
Big, tough, confident.

01:01:22.119 --> 01:01:24.038
Pure jelly!

01:01:25.123 --> 01:01:27.584
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

01:01:27.792 --> 01:01:30.503
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:32.505
That little episode was not on TV.

01:01:32.713 --> 01:01:35.925
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

01:01:36.133 --> 01:01:37.510
He was sick.

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.387
Sick with drink.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:40.889
He wouldn't come out.

01:01:40.972 --> 01:01:42.348
He'd busted some furniture...

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:46.227
and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

01:01:46.477 --> 01:01:48.771
So I went to his room.

01:01:49.064 --> 01:01:51.775
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

01:01:51.983 --> 01:01:53.359
He was half crazy.

01:01:53.568 --> 01:01:55.236
Violent and screaming one minute...

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.738
weak and crying the next.

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:01.451
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:06.164
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

01:02:06.664 --> 01:02:10.126
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:13.797
I thought he'd hit me.

01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:16.799
He walked toward me...

01:02:17.217 --> 01:02:21.095
with a funny sort of smile on his face.

01:02:22.596 --> 01:02:25.100
Then he did the strangest thing.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.268
He kissed me.

01:02:27.936 --> 01:02:30.521
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

01:02:31.022 --> 01:02:33.107
<i>And then I knew what I was going to do.</i>

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.276
I'd get rid of Skipper.

01:02:35.484 --> 01:02:39.239
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

01:02:39.948 --> 01:02:41.366
<i>I'd prove it by showing...</i>

01:02:41.574 --> 01:02:45.161
<i>that Skipper would make love
to his best friend's wife.</i>

01:02:45.703 --> 01:02:47.496
He didn't need any coaxing.

01:02:47.705 --> 01:02:49.666
He was more than willing.

01:02:49.874 --> 01:02:52.210
He even seemed to have the same idea.

01:02:53.253 --> 01:02:55.129
You're just trying to whitewash it.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:56.671
I'm not!

01:02:56.756 --> 01:02:58.549
I was trying to win back my husband.

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:01.761
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:03.972
Even that.

01:03:05.056 --> 01:03:06.724
But at the last second...

01:03:06.891 --> 01:03:08.643
I got panicky.

01:03:09.769 --> 01:03:12.396
Supposing I lost you instead?

01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:16.276
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

01:03:17.235 --> 01:03:19.070
So I ran.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.197
Nothing happened!

01:03:21.405 --> 01:03:24.325
<i>I've tried to tell him a hundred times
but he won't let me.</i>

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:26.244
<i>Nothing happened!</i>

01:03:26.453 --> 01:03:28.663
Hallelujah, St. Maggie.

01:03:30.456 --> 01:03:32.917
I wanted to get rid of Skipper.

01:03:33.793 --> 01:03:35.544
But not if it meant losing you.

01:03:35.753 --> 01:03:38.089
<i>He blames me for Skipper's death.</i>

01:03:39.007 --> 01:03:41.968
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.

01:03:44.637 --> 01:03:47.181
Skipper won out anyway.

01:03:49.517 --> 01:03:52.061
I didn't get rid of him at all.

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.447
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?

01:04:03.323 --> 01:04:05.450
I lost you anyway.

01:04:08.119 --> 01:04:10.746
- You didn't talk to him again before he...
- No.

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:13.875
- But Brick did.
- How do you know?

01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:15.794
- Skipper told me.
- When?

01:04:16.002 --> 01:04:18.629
When they put his broken body
in the ambulance.

01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:20.840
I rode with him to the hospital.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:25.262
<i>He kept saying,
"Why did Brick hang up on me? "</i>

01:04:26.638 --> 01:04:28.473
Why, Brick?

01:04:43.863 --> 01:04:46.198
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.913
- You can't drive. You're drunk.
- Not yet, Big Daddy.

01:04:51.996 --> 01:04:54.332
Not yet. Now, give me that bottle.

01:04:58.002 --> 01:04:59.795
What are you running away from?

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.512
Why did you hang up on Skipper
when he called you?

01:05:11.057 --> 01:05:12.349
Answer me!

01:05:13.268 --> 01:05:16.104
What did he say?
Was it about him and Maggie?

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:18.606
- He said they'd made love.
- And you believed him?

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:19.899
Yes.

01:05:20.775 --> 01:05:22.610
Then why haven't you thrown her out?

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.947
Something's missing here.
Why did Skipper kill himself?

01:05:26.698 --> 01:05:28.366
Because somebody let him down.

01:05:35.664 --> 01:05:37.375
I let him down.

01:05:39.461 --> 01:05:41.462
When he called that night...

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.801
<i>I couldn't make sense out of...</i>

01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:50.055
But there was one thing that was sure.

01:05:52.265 --> 01:05:54.642
Skipper was scared.

01:05:55.143 --> 01:05:56.853
Scared...

01:05:58.229 --> 01:06:01.023
about what happened that day
on the football field.

01:06:01.233 --> 01:06:02.233
That I'd blame him.

01:06:02.275 --> 01:06:05.486
Scared that I'd walk out on him.

01:06:07.113 --> 01:06:10.366
Skipper afraid! I couldn't believe that.

01:06:10.574 --> 01:06:14.037
I mean, inside he was real
deep-down scared...

01:06:14.746 --> 01:06:17.498
<i>and he broke like a rotten stick.</i>

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:21.002
He started crying:

01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:23.921
<i>"I need you."</i>

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.591
<i>He kept babbling, "Help me."</i>

01:06:28.009 --> 01:06:29.927
Me help him?

01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:33.764
How does one drowning man...

01:06:33.973 --> 01:06:35.599
help another drowning man?

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.019
So you hung up on him.

01:06:39.771 --> 01:06:41.814
And then that phone...

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.442
started to ring again.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:49.781
It rang and it rang
and it wouldn't stop ringing.

01:06:50.198 --> 01:06:55.244
And I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move or run from that sound.

01:06:55.495 --> 01:06:58.039
It kept ringing louder and louder.

01:06:58.456 --> 01:07:02.127
And the sound of that
was like Skipper screaming for help.

01:07:06.464 --> 01:07:08.799
And I couldn't pick it up.

01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:13.053
So that's when he killed himself?

01:07:17.558 --> 01:07:18.685
Yes.

01:07:20.478 --> 01:07:22.605
Because I let him down.

01:07:27.318 --> 01:07:31.823
So that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

01:07:32.031 --> 01:07:36.368
When I hear that click I don't hear
the sound of that phone ringing anymore.

01:07:36.577 --> 01:07:38.663
And I can stop thinking.

01:07:38.872 --> 01:07:40.498
I'm ashamed!

01:07:40.707 --> 01:07:44.085
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.

01:07:44.544 --> 01:07:47.296
But the truth is always there
in the morning, isn't it?

01:07:48.255 --> 01:07:50.091
And it's here right now.

01:07:51.509 --> 01:07:55.430
You're just feeling sorry
for yourself. That's all it is. Self-pity!

01:07:55.513 --> 01:07:57.848
You didn't kill Skipper. He killed himself.

01:07:58.015 --> 01:08:01.143
You, Skipper and lots like you,
living in a kid's world...

01:08:01.353 --> 01:08:05.231
playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

01:08:05.523 --> 01:08:07.567
Life ain't no damn football game.

01:08:07.775 --> 01:08:09.860
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

01:08:11.278 --> 01:08:14.699
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid...

01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:17.660
pretending you hear cheers
when there ain't any.

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:20.037
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

01:08:20.246 --> 01:08:21.622
Heroes in the real world...

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:25.335
<i>live 24 hours a day,
not just two hours in a game.</i>

01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:29.339
Mendacity! You won't...

01:08:31.799 --> 01:08:35.386
You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

01:08:35.553 --> 01:08:37.680
The truth is pain and sweat...

01:08:37.889 --> 01:08:42.143
paying bills and making love to a woman
that you don't love anymore.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:44.437
The truth is dreams that don't come true...

01:08:44.562 --> 01:08:47.564
and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:55.073
Now, here.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.161
The truth is you never growed up.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.540
- Grown-ups don't hang up on friends.
- Get away.

01:09:03.622 --> 01:09:06.917
And they don't hang up on their wives.
They don't hang up on life.

01:09:07.085 --> 01:09:09.754
Now that's the truth that you can't face.

01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:11.546
- Can you face the truth?
- Try me.

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:13.341
Sure, somebody else's truth!

01:09:13.425 --> 01:09:15.176
- You're running again.
- Yeah, I am.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.886
Running from lies,
like birthday congratulations...

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.557
and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any, and...

01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:35.112
Please, let me go home.

01:09:36.447 --> 01:09:38.241
- What did you say?
- I don't remember.

01:09:38.325 --> 01:09:41.577
- There won't be any happy returns?
- Forget it.

01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:44.330
Let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:47.792
Who said I was going to leave
the place or anything?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.544
I'll outlive you.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:50.837
I'll bury you.

01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:53.089
- I'll buy your coffin.
- That's right.

01:09:53.298 --> 01:09:55.299
Many happy returns.

01:10:01.138 --> 01:10:02.932
They were lying...

01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:04.517
weren't they, son...

01:10:04.893 --> 01:10:07.145
about that report from the clinic?

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:10.648
This pain...

01:10:10.815 --> 01:10:12.566
<i>that keeps grabbing at me...</i>

01:10:13.735 --> 01:10:15.153
It's death...

01:10:16.321 --> 01:10:17.488
ain't it?

01:10:18.489 --> 01:10:19.991
Answer me!

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:21.784
The truth!

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:27.874
You said it yourself.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

01:11:04.202 --> 01:11:05.202
Brick, wait!

01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:30.311
Look at us, Maggie.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.022
The great Pollitt Enterprises...

01:11:33.648 --> 01:11:35.608
<i>stuck in the...</i>

01:11:36.775 --> 01:11:38.528
I hurt him, Maggie.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.159
I hurt him really bad.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:47.078
What's the matter? What's happened?

01:11:47.286 --> 01:11:50.206
- Why is Big Daddy...
- We've got to talk to you.

01:11:50.457 --> 01:11:52.500
- Get Dr. Baugh!
- Where is he?

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.544
I don't know, just find him.

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:04.970
Doc!

01:12:06.597 --> 01:12:09.267
I wouldn't go down to him right now.

01:12:09.517 --> 01:12:10.601
Sweetheart!

01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:14.147
Big Daddy, can you hear me?

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.317
What are you doing?

01:12:17.442 --> 01:12:19.068
I'm coming down.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:25.157
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

01:12:35.835 --> 01:12:37.754
If that pain gets too bad...

01:12:38.797 --> 01:12:40.632
this is morphine...

01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:42.800
and a syringe.

01:12:43.384 --> 01:12:46.095
The instructions are written out.

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:50.350
It's no use pretending anymore.

01:12:50.558 --> 01:12:53.186
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.439
Make it easy on yourself.

01:12:58.899 --> 01:13:00.276
Here.

01:13:00.818 --> 01:13:03.655
You'd better take off those wet clothes.

01:13:04.489 --> 01:13:05.489
Why?

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:07.950
You afraid I might catch cold and die?

01:13:24.758 --> 01:13:26.136
Why can't I go down to him?

01:13:26.219 --> 01:13:27.762
<i>Well, he's...</i>

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:32.767
His stomach's upset, Ida.

01:13:34.685 --> 01:13:36.562
All he needs is a peppermint.

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:39.816
It's time we had that talk, Doc.

01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:43.111
- It'll be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.

01:13:43.444 --> 01:13:45.613
So I've noticed. But there are times...

01:13:45.905 --> 01:13:47.656
It's time we all had our talk.

01:13:47.865 --> 01:13:50.160
What talk are you talking about?

01:13:50.368 --> 01:13:53.955
- What were they fighting about?
- We didn't discuss it.

01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:56.374
What's he doing in the cellar
all alone?

01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:58.000
Why can't Big Mama see him?

01:13:58.209 --> 01:13:59.376
You heard why.

01:13:59.585 --> 01:14:02.881
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:06.801
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:10.763
they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

01:14:11.931 --> 01:14:13.558
Isn't that so?

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:16.895
Of course that's so.

01:14:17.729 --> 01:14:19.480
He loves his family.

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:22.358
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

01:14:22.566 --> 01:14:25.319
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

01:14:25.402 --> 01:14:28.072
It's the party and the excitement.

01:14:28.281 --> 01:14:30.867
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

01:14:31.075 --> 01:14:32.451
Did you notice how he ate?

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:34.829
He ate like a P-l-G hog.

01:14:35.412 --> 01:14:37.414
I hope he doesn't regret it.

01:14:37.791 --> 01:14:38.917
Who?

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:40.752
Big Daddy?

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:43.421
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

01:14:43.921 --> 01:14:47.383
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

01:14:47.591 --> 01:14:49.093
And candied yams.

01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:52.639
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

01:14:53.348 --> 01:14:55.516
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:56.892
What's that?

01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:58.394
Gooper say he hopes...

01:14:58.602 --> 01:15:00.896
Shoot! Gooper says!

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:03.775
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:07.110
Ain't that so?

01:15:10.448 --> 01:15:13.033
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:17.538
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:20.416
he wasn't doomed to...

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.544
what he thought he was doomed to.

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:28.132
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

01:15:28.299 --> 01:15:30.551
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:33.262
Doc, come here!

01:15:33.346 --> 01:15:34.764
I don't need any doctor.

01:15:34.847 --> 01:15:36.724
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

01:15:36.807 --> 01:15:38.351
I want Brick.

01:15:39.185 --> 01:15:41.104
He'll be down directly.

01:15:41.312 --> 01:15:43.689
Sticky rain
always makes me sick.

01:15:44.732 --> 01:15:47.401
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:50.739
What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

01:15:53.658 --> 01:15:54.909
Big Mama needs you.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:56.744
They'll tell her without me.

01:15:56.869 --> 01:15:58.412
Please, Brick.

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:01.332
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are...

01:16:01.498 --> 01:16:04.043
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

01:16:04.252 --> 01:16:06.379
Let them have it all.

01:16:06.587 --> 01:16:09.006
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:11.425
you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

01:16:11.509 --> 01:16:15.805
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

01:16:16.014 --> 01:16:17.432
<i>What I can't stand is...</i>

01:16:17.515 --> 01:16:20.685
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:24.480
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

01:16:24.688 --> 01:16:27.400
Careful, your claws are showing.

01:16:30.695 --> 01:16:32.029
Close that door.

01:16:32.238 --> 01:16:33.906
Don't close that door.

01:16:34.865 --> 01:16:36.533
Let a little air circulate.

01:16:37.242 --> 01:16:39.871
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

01:16:40.288 --> 01:16:41.873
What discussion of what?

01:16:41.956 --> 01:16:44.667
- Maggie, Brick!
- Now, now, Big Mama...

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:47.419
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:50.590
that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:53.051
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

01:16:53.259 --> 01:16:55.595
Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

01:16:55.803 --> 01:16:57.847
- He don't need no cure.
- Of course not.

01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:00.724
He'll just drink
all the whisky in the state.

01:17:00.808 --> 01:17:02.936
Stop that kind of talk!

01:17:03.061 --> 01:17:06.773
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

01:17:06.981 --> 01:17:08.482
Good for you!

01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:11.861
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:15.406
What are you all
surrounding me for?

01:17:15.615 --> 01:17:17.492
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.700
Are you all crazy?

01:17:18.743 --> 01:17:22.121
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.
- You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

01:17:22.329 --> 01:17:23.664
How can I calm myself...

01:17:23.747 --> 01:17:26.751
<i>with everyone staring at me
as if blood was on my face?</i>

01:17:28.753 --> 01:17:30.671
What's all this about?

01:17:31.797 --> 01:17:32.965
Sit down, Mae.

01:17:33.174 --> 01:17:36.051
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.637
Truth!

01:17:38.555 --> 01:17:41.224
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

01:17:41.432 --> 01:17:42.892
The truth is as dirty...

01:17:43.101 --> 01:17:44.227
as lies!

01:17:52.694 --> 01:17:54.612
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

01:17:54.695 --> 01:17:56.155
<i>Well, Ida...</i>

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:57.573
I want to know!

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.330
- Somebody must be lying.
- Sit down, Mama, please.

01:18:04.998 --> 01:18:06.791
I want to know about my husband.

01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:10.711
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.963
One of the best clinics in the country.

01:18:13.047 --> 01:18:15.633
The best in the country, bar none.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.469
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:19.971
Right, Doc?

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:21.138
Sure of what?

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.474
- Not now!
- The test was positive!

01:18:23.557 --> 01:18:24.642
Mae, shut up.

01:18:30.481 --> 01:18:33.693
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

01:18:34.693 --> 01:18:35.736
Hopeless?

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:38.615
- Now, now, darling.
- You had to know.

01:18:39.824 --> 01:18:42.660
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

01:18:43.995 --> 01:18:47.164
- It's gone past the knife.
- He's dying, Big Mama.

01:18:47.373 --> 01:18:49.541
You get away from me, Mae!

01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:50.585
I want Brick.

01:18:50.668 --> 01:18:52.754
<i>Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?</i>

01:18:55.548 --> 01:18:56.591
Brick!

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.050
Mama, please.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.097
- I'm your son, too.
- Gooper's your firstborn.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.307
- Now, listen to me!
- No!

01:19:04.724 --> 01:19:06.684
- He'll be in pain.
- Gooper and I think...

01:19:06.893 --> 01:19:08.311
Mae, shut up!

01:19:08.519 --> 01:19:10.271
- Do you want to see him suffer?
- No.

01:19:10.354 --> 01:19:12.856
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

01:19:13.023 --> 01:19:15.693
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:17.528
No.

01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:25.704
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

01:19:25.787 --> 01:19:27.622
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

01:19:27.705 --> 01:19:31.876
Instead of the needle, haven't
you got a pill to make the pain disappear?

01:19:32.043 --> 01:19:35.629
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:39.134
<i>Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate...</i>

01:19:55.733 --> 01:19:56.733
Does Brick know?

01:20:10.748 --> 01:20:12.666
You know, honey...

01:20:14.627 --> 01:20:17.046
we was never a very happy family.

01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:21.967
There wasn't much joy in this house.

01:20:22.176 --> 01:20:25.429
<i>It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just...</i>

01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:29.475
You know how some homes are happy.

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:35.272
<i>I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, "Now we'll be happy here."</i>

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:39.194
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:41.612
And we'll help each other be happy.

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:48.911
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

01:20:55.835 --> 01:20:57.169
Margaret, honey...

01:20:57.378 --> 01:20:58.712
you've got to help Brick.

01:20:58.796 --> 01:21:00.464
Make him pull himself together.

01:21:00.673 --> 01:21:03.384
- He'll take hold of things.
- What things?

01:21:06.054 --> 01:21:07.054
The place.

01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:09.181
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:10.683
We've all had a shock.

01:21:10.766 --> 01:21:13.728
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough...

01:21:13.812 --> 01:21:17.065
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

01:21:17.148 --> 01:21:19.567
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

01:21:19.984 --> 01:21:22.361
My husband is not going to die!

01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:24.989
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

01:21:25.072 --> 01:21:27.534
- We're hoping too.
- We intend to pray for him.

01:21:27.742 --> 01:21:29.827
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to...

01:21:29.911 --> 01:21:31.913
Gooper is your firstborn!

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:35.833
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

01:21:35.916 --> 01:21:39.712
<i>Brick never carried a thing in his life
but a football or a highball.</i>

01:21:39.921 --> 01:21:41.714
Will you let me talk, please?

01:21:41.798 --> 01:21:43.257
Yes, of course.

01:21:44.759 --> 01:21:47.636
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

01:21:47.845 --> 01:21:49.263
Almost single-handed.

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:53.017
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

01:21:53.184 --> 01:21:55.728
Mama, let's be fair.

01:21:56.437 --> 01:21:58.773
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

01:21:58.856 --> 01:22:01.358
Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

01:22:01.442 --> 01:22:02.277
<i>Mae...</i>

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.904
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

01:22:04.988 --> 01:22:05.988
Mae!

01:22:06.155 --> 01:22:07.740
Big Daddy don't know what he owns.

01:22:07.823 --> 01:22:11.911
The point is I won't see this
place ruined by a drunken ex-football hero.

01:22:12.119 --> 01:22:13.955
Shut up about my husband!

01:22:14.164 --> 01:22:14.998
You shut up!

01:22:15.081 --> 01:22:17.041
He has no right to slander...

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:19.919
I can discuss my brother
with my family members...

01:22:20.378 --> 01:22:22.671
<i>which don't include you!</i>

01:22:23.797 --> 01:22:26.134
Why not go up
and drink with Brick?

01:22:26.217 --> 01:22:28.761
If the hero hadn't passed out already.

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:31.806
He may have to pass up
the Sugar Bowl this year.

01:22:31.889 --> 01:22:34.100
Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his run in?

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:35.851
It was the punch bowl, honey.

01:22:35.935 --> 01:22:37.979
The cut-glass punch bowl.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.607
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

01:22:41.232 --> 01:22:44.819
I have never seen such malice
toward a brother.

01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:47.238
What about his malice toward Gooper?

01:22:47.446 --> 01:22:50.867
He can't even stand being
in the same room with me.

01:22:52.327 --> 01:22:54.203
Can I help you, Mr. Brick?

01:22:54.287 --> 01:22:55.580
No, thank you, Lacey.

01:22:55.663 --> 01:22:58.332
- Where's my father?
- He's in the cellar.

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:00.417
And he's alone.

01:23:00.793 --> 01:23:01.961
<i>And he's...</i>

01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:04.297
Thank you, Lacey.

01:23:04.797 --> 01:23:06.966
It's a deliberate campaign to ruin Brick.

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:08.426
He don't need help.

01:23:08.509 --> 01:23:10.970
For the most disgusting,
sordid reasons on earth.

01:23:11.178 --> 01:23:12.178
Avarice.

01:23:12.346 --> 01:23:14.849
Avarice and greed!

01:23:15.058 --> 01:23:16.058
No, Margaret.

01:23:16.184 --> 01:23:17.560
<i>Don't cry.</i>

01:23:17.769 --> 01:23:20.104
- That takes the cake!
- Mae.

01:23:20.313 --> 01:23:22.064
Who are the tears for?

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:23.816
Brick?

01:23:23.899 --> 01:23:24.984
Big Daddy?

01:23:25.067 --> 01:23:26.194
- Or for yourself?
- Mae!

01:23:26.528 --> 01:23:28.446
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?

01:23:28.529 --> 01:23:30.156
You know why she's got no kids?

01:23:30.364 --> 01:23:33.701
- Ask her big, beautiful husband.
- Mae!

01:23:34.535 --> 01:23:37.246
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you?

01:23:39.249 --> 01:23:41.542
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.

01:23:41.751 --> 01:23:43.252
How would you know?

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:45.880
<i>How would he know?</i>

01:23:46.005 --> 01:23:47.965
Did he ever let anyone love him?

01:23:48.173 --> 01:23:50.760
It was always Brick.
From the day he was born...

01:23:50.844 --> 01:23:53.471
he was always partial to Brick. Why?

01:23:53.638 --> 01:23:56.307
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.

01:23:56.515 --> 01:23:57.892
He said get married. I did.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.894
He said have kids. I did.

01:24:00.102 --> 01:24:02.147
He said live in Memphis. I did.

01:24:02.355 --> 01:24:04.983
Whatever he said to do, I did.

01:24:06.234 --> 01:24:08.903
I don't give a damn
whether Big Daddy likes me...

01:24:09.111 --> 01:24:10.738
or did or never did...

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:13.073
or will or will never.

01:24:14.409 --> 01:24:17.954
I've appealed for common decency
and fair play.

01:24:18.162 --> 01:24:19.872
Now I'm telling you!

01:24:20.206 --> 01:24:22.166
I intend to protect my interests.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:25.002
I'm not a corporation lawyer for nothing.

01:24:25.711 --> 01:24:28.589
- Go get my briefcase.
- Yes, honey.

01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:36.263
<i>It was...</i>

01:24:36.513 --> 01:24:39.225
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.

01:24:58.869 --> 01:25:00.037
Pa?

01:25:26.773 --> 01:25:27.899
Pa?

01:25:40.912 --> 01:25:43.998
- Give me your hand.
- I don't want your hand!

01:26:37.509 --> 01:26:38.511
No.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.138
It's my pain.

01:26:40.305 --> 01:26:42.140
That makes it my business.

01:26:42.473 --> 01:26:45.351
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?

01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:47.645
I came to apologize.

01:26:49.146 --> 01:26:50.899
What for, telling me the truth?

01:26:51.107 --> 01:26:54.444
- There must a dozen reasons.
- Save them.

01:26:54.652 --> 01:26:57.279
I hate apologies. Especially for the truth.

01:26:57.488 --> 01:27:00.574
Whatever you did, don't apologize.
Just don't do it again.

01:27:00.783 --> 01:27:02.869
If you didn't do it, start doing it.

01:27:03.077 --> 01:27:05.163
Start by getting me a cigar
out of that coat.

01:27:05.246 --> 01:27:07.873
- You think you ought to...
- Get me the cigar, boy!

01:27:13.796 --> 01:27:14.839
It's wet from rain.

01:27:14.923 --> 01:27:18.968
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.

01:27:22.847 --> 01:27:24.848
Modern science!

01:27:37.361 --> 01:27:38.905
Get me that...

01:27:43.409 --> 01:27:44.409
that robe.

01:27:56.172 --> 01:27:59.216
- There's a bottle in that desk.
- I don't want a drink.

01:27:59.425 --> 01:28:00.884
I do.

01:28:01.051 --> 01:28:02.720
I want a drink.

01:28:03.221 --> 01:28:05.890
I've got a million clicks in my guts.

01:28:07.225 --> 01:28:09.727
Knives sharpening themselves.

01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:14.941
You know about clicks,
don't you?

01:28:18.152 --> 01:28:20.488
So you bought me a birthday present, huh?

01:28:21.822 --> 01:28:23.616
No, Maggie bought it.

01:28:24.825 --> 01:28:28.579
- She's got good taste that girl.
- In some things, yes...

01:28:28.788 --> 01:28:30.540
but not in men.

01:28:33.459 --> 01:28:35.085
Nice soft material.

01:28:35.502 --> 01:28:37.463
This is my soft birthday.

01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:41.050
Not my gold or silver.
This is my soft birthday.

01:28:46.263 --> 01:28:47.932
Here's to my...

01:28:48.098 --> 01:28:49.933
last birthday.

01:28:51.269 --> 01:28:53.354
Aren't you drinking to that?

01:28:55.606 --> 01:28:57.274
Clickety-click.

01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:10.996
You know what I'm going to do
before I die?

01:29:12.289 --> 01:29:14.459
I'm going to open up all these boxes.

01:29:16.794 --> 01:29:18.463
<i>Will you look at this stuff?</i>

01:29:19.046 --> 01:29:20.214
<i>Bought most of it...</i>

01:29:20.423 --> 01:29:23.050
when I took your mother to Europe
on that tour.

01:29:23.133 --> 01:29:25.969
Never had such a lousy time in my life.

01:29:26.304 --> 01:29:29.140
That Europe is nothing
but a great big auction.

01:29:29.432 --> 01:29:33.144
Bunch of old worn-out places.
It's just a big fire sale.

01:29:33.352 --> 01:29:35.437
Big Mama went wild in it.

01:29:35.646 --> 01:29:38.316
She just bought and bought.

01:29:39.067 --> 01:29:42.069
She was lucky I'm a rich man.
Yes, it sure is lucky.

01:29:42.862 --> 01:29:45.990
<i>Got any idea what I'm worth? Ask Gooper.</i>

01:29:46.198 --> 01:29:48.909
<i>He knows to the penny
unless I miss my guess.</i>

01:29:50.328 --> 01:29:53.998
Close on $10 million in cash
and blue-chip stocks...

01:29:54.207 --> 01:29:57.043
besides some 28,000 acres
of the richest land...

01:29:57.251 --> 01:29:59.086
<i>this side of the Valley Nile.</i>

01:29:59.295 --> 01:30:01.505
That is pretty rich to be.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:09.096
There's one thing you can't buy
in a Europe fire sale...

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:11.890
or any other market on earth.

01:30:12.516 --> 01:30:14.144
That's your life.

01:30:16.813 --> 01:30:19.774
<i>You can't buy back your life
when it's finished.</i>

01:30:20.024 --> 01:30:21.901
No, sir. Nobody can do that.

01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:25.070
Feeling sorry for me or you?

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.701
For you, Papa.

01:30:30.868 --> 01:30:33.537
That's good,
because you're going to miss me.

01:30:35.664 --> 01:30:38.209
Why did you let Ma buy all this stuff?

01:30:38.877 --> 01:30:42.839
The human animal is a beast
that eventually has to die.

01:30:43.214 --> 01:30:46.634
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.

01:30:47.551 --> 01:30:50.388
The reason why he buys everything he can,
is because...

01:30:50.472 --> 01:30:54.475
of a crazy hope that one of the things
he buys will be life everlasting...

01:30:55.059 --> 01:30:56.977
which it never can be.

01:30:57.395 --> 01:31:01.148
I've suddenly noticed you don't call me
Big Daddy anymore.

01:31:01.356 --> 01:31:04.360
If you needed a Big Daddy,
why didn't you come to me?

01:31:04.569 --> 01:31:08.572
If you wanted someone to lean on, why
Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.

01:31:08.864 --> 01:31:11.659
You should've come to your kinfolk.
Those who love you.

01:31:11.742 --> 01:31:15.163
You don't know what love means.
To you it's another four-letter word.

01:31:15.246 --> 01:31:16.789
You've got a short memory.

01:31:17.081 --> 01:31:20.960
- What did you want that I didn't buy?
- You can't buy love!

01:31:21.168 --> 01:31:24.546
You bought $1 million worth of junk!
Does it love you?

01:31:24.755 --> 01:31:28.134
Who do you think I bought it for?
It's yours, the place, the money!

01:31:28.343 --> 01:31:30.303
I don't want things!

01:31:32.847 --> 01:31:34.557
We drew this up...

01:31:36.767 --> 01:31:40.229
- We drew this up with the advice...
- Get out of the way.

01:31:42.106 --> 01:31:44.442
- Get out of my way.
- We're settling this first.

01:31:44.525 --> 01:31:47.653
- I don't want to see it.
- It's a sort of a plan. A preliminary.

01:31:55.453 --> 01:31:56.996
Waste!

01:32:06.964 --> 01:32:08.382
Worthless!

01:32:17.308 --> 01:32:18.809
Worthless!

01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:41.874
Don't, son.

01:32:43.501 --> 01:32:45.002
Please don't cry.

01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:01.351
That's funny.

01:33:01.977 --> 01:33:05.565
I never saw you cry before.
Did you ever cry as a kid?

01:33:05.648 --> 01:33:10.194
Can't you understand?
I never wanted your place or money.

01:33:10.486 --> 01:33:12.696
I don't want to own anything!

01:33:12.905 --> 01:33:16.200
All I wanted was a father, not a boss!

01:33:16.701 --> 01:33:18.828
I wanted you to love me.

01:33:19.036 --> 01:33:20.579
I did and I do.

01:33:21.664 --> 01:33:24.208
Not me and not Gooper,
and not even Mama.

01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:25.751
That's a lie.

01:33:25.959 --> 01:33:27.462
I loved her. I gave her...

01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:30.756
Things, Papa, you gave her things.

01:33:30.965 --> 01:33:33.509
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.

01:33:33.717 --> 01:33:37.346
Some jewelry.
You gave her things, not love.

01:33:39.057 --> 01:33:40.933
I gave her an empire.

01:33:41.142 --> 01:33:44.061
I've seen you out there on your empire...

01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:47.439
with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names...

01:33:47.648 --> 01:33:51.277
or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.

01:33:51.361 --> 01:33:54.989
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

01:33:55.239 --> 01:33:58.242
<i>Next week,
I'll start building that textile plant.</i>

01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:02.413
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and market it.

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.331
I'll tell you...

01:34:03.539 --> 01:34:05.958
<i>in a year or two from now...</i>

01:34:21.682 --> 01:34:25.936
The men who build empires die,
and empires die too.

01:34:26.604 --> 01:34:27.897
No, it won't.

01:34:28.106 --> 01:34:30.107
That's why I've got you and Gooper.

01:34:30.316 --> 01:34:31.567
Look at Gooper.

01:34:31.776 --> 01:34:35.154
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

01:34:35.362 --> 01:34:36.864
Look at me.

01:34:37.197 --> 01:34:41.411
You were right. I am a 30-year-old kid.
And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.

01:34:41.619 --> 01:34:44.955
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?

01:34:45.164 --> 01:34:48.709
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

01:34:49.334 --> 01:34:52.964
Look at me, for the sake of God,
before it's too late!

01:34:53.131 --> 01:34:56.008
For once, look at me as I really am.

01:34:56.217 --> 01:34:57.510
Look at me!

01:34:58.969 --> 01:35:00.554
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

01:35:00.679 --> 01:35:04.309
On my own in the open market,
I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.

01:35:04.517 --> 01:35:09.063
- All of you blame me for everything, huh?
- No, Papa.

01:35:12.566 --> 01:35:15.612
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

01:35:16.237 --> 01:35:20.783
You own 28,000 acres.
You own $10 million.

01:35:20.991 --> 01:35:25.370
You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

01:35:26.372 --> 01:35:28.958
- In my own way...
- No, sir.

01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:31.460
You don't even like people.

01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:35.756
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?

01:35:36.924 --> 01:35:40.970
I want a part of me to keep living.
I won't have it end with the grave.

01:35:41.179 --> 01:35:42.388
Look!

01:35:43.014 --> 01:35:45.558
This is what my father left me.

01:35:45.766 --> 01:35:47.268
This lousy old suitcase!

01:35:47.977 --> 01:35:50.271
On the inside was nothing...

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.192
but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.736
This was his legacy to me.

01:35:56.944 --> 01:35:58.612
Nothing at all!

01:36:00.698 --> 01:36:03.618
And I built this place from nothing.

01:36:08.664 --> 01:36:10.833
And that's all he left you?

01:36:11.208 --> 01:36:13.752
Yeah, he was a hobo.

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:18.257
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

01:36:18.466 --> 01:36:22.011
He worked once in a while as a field hand.
I'd tag along.

01:36:22.636 --> 01:36:26.056
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt,
waiting for him.

01:36:27.558 --> 01:36:29.310
Outside of hunger...

01:36:29.519 --> 01:36:31.979
first thing I could remember is shame.

01:36:32.188 --> 01:36:35.024
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

01:36:35.482 --> 01:36:39.821
<i>I was riding boxcars when I was nine,
something you never had to do.</i>

01:36:40.029 --> 01:36:43.407
<i>And you'll never have to bury me
like I did him.</i>

01:36:44.116 --> 01:36:47.411
I buried him in a meadow,
alongside a railroad track.

01:36:47.578 --> 01:36:50.999
We were running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

01:36:54.043 --> 01:36:55.503
You know something?

01:36:56.837 --> 01:36:59.048
That lousy old tramp died laughing.

01:36:59.256 --> 01:37:00.924
Laughing at what?

01:37:01.925 --> 01:37:03.803
Himself, I guess.

01:37:04.012 --> 01:37:05.471
A hobo tramp...

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.558
not a nickel in his jeans.
No future, no past.

01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:14.939
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

01:37:15.857 --> 01:37:17.775
Happy at having you with him.

01:37:17.942 --> 01:37:20.778
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

01:37:22.613 --> 01:37:24.573
I don't want to talk about that.

01:37:39.964 --> 01:37:41.757
Yeah, I loved him.

01:37:45.803 --> 01:37:48.722
I reckon I never loved anything
as much as that...

01:37:48.931 --> 01:37:50.642
lousy old tramp.

01:37:52.477 --> 01:37:53.895
And you say...

01:37:54.103 --> 01:37:56.522
<i>he left you nothing but a suitcase...</i>

01:37:56.731 --> 01:38:00.234
<i>with a uniform in it
from the Spanish-American War?</i>

01:38:00.776 --> 01:38:02.487
And some memories.

01:38:03.821 --> 01:38:05.073
And love.

01:38:10.953 --> 01:38:13.330
Did I tell you all them stories
about my old man?

01:38:13.539 --> 01:38:15.124
About fifty times.

01:38:29.347 --> 01:38:32.850
It's a plan to protect the Delta's
biggest estate from irresponsibility.

01:38:32.933 --> 01:38:33.934
You have to sign.

01:38:37.187 --> 01:38:38.982
Where is it?

01:38:39.857 --> 01:38:40.525
What?

01:38:40.650 --> 01:38:43.986
What the doctor left
to make his pain easier.

01:38:44.653 --> 01:38:48.365
Brick's down there with him.
He'll help Big Daddy.

01:38:48.574 --> 01:38:50.033
Help him? How?

01:38:50.242 --> 01:38:52.328
- By running the 100-yard dash?
- Shut up.

01:38:52.537 --> 01:38:55.581
Maybe he'll cheer him up
by kicking some field goals.

01:38:55.873 --> 01:38:58.709
One more crack, Queenie...

01:38:58.876 --> 01:39:03.298
and I will not only spit in your eye
but I will punch it black and blue.

01:39:03.381 --> 01:39:04.257
Hold on a minute!

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:06.968
- I'm not listening to any more...
- Mae was only saying...

01:39:07.051 --> 01:39:09.804
I know what she said,
and I know exactly what she meant.

01:39:09.887 --> 01:39:11.764
The only world that Brick knows...

01:39:11.847 --> 01:39:14.099
It's not a world he made.

01:39:18.396 --> 01:39:19.396
Ladies!

01:39:21.232 --> 01:39:23.692
- No.
- Why won't you take it?

01:39:24.693 --> 01:39:28.031
- It'll kill the pain, that's all.
- It'll kill the senses, too.

01:39:28.239 --> 01:39:30.992
When you've got pain
at least you know you're alive.

01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:38.875
It's easing somewhat now.

01:39:41.294 --> 01:39:42.837
When you've got pain...

01:39:43.254 --> 01:39:46.298
it's better to judge yourself,
a lot of things.

01:39:46.507 --> 01:39:49.009
I'm not going to stupefy myself
with that stuff.

01:39:49.093 --> 01:39:50.762
I want to think clear.

01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:53.473
I want to see everything
and feel everything.

01:39:53.681 --> 01:39:55.433
Then I won't mind going.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.769
I've got the guts to die.

01:39:58.978 --> 01:40:01.939
What I want to know is,
have you got the guts to live?

01:40:02.314 --> 01:40:03.775
I don't know.

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:06.652
We can try.

01:40:08.571 --> 01:40:11.615
We could start by helping each other
up these stairs.

01:40:24.128 --> 01:40:25.337
Yes, sir.

01:40:28.508 --> 01:40:30.051
At least read them.

01:40:30.176 --> 01:40:32.428
Put those papers away
before I tear them up.

01:40:32.636 --> 01:40:34.889
I don't want to know what's in them.

01:40:35.097 --> 01:40:39.560
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language.
I'm his wife, not his widow. His wife!

01:40:39.936 --> 01:40:42.313
- What I've got here...
- He said it's just a plan.

01:40:42.396 --> 01:40:45.399
<i>Plan basis. What I'll
say to your plan is...</i>

01:40:47.443 --> 01:40:51.114
Maggie, what is it Big Daddy says
when he's disgusted?

01:40:51.197 --> 01:40:54.158
<i>He says "bull" when he's disgusted.</i>

01:40:54.325 --> 01:40:57.036
<i>That's right. I say
"bull" like Big Daddy.</i>

01:40:57.244 --> 01:41:00.122
- Coarse language don't seem called for.
- Bull!

01:41:00.205 --> 01:41:02.332
I'm outraged by this kind of talk.

01:41:02.416 --> 01:41:06.170
Then stop talking like
your father's dead and me along with him.

01:41:06.254 --> 01:41:08.506
What about her? She wants her share, too.

01:41:08.923 --> 01:41:11.091
As far as Brick is concerned...

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.844
nobody's going to take nothing.

01:41:14.052 --> 01:41:15.763
Not till Big Daddy lets go...

01:41:15.972 --> 01:41:20.017
and maybe just possibly, not even then!

01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:22.353
No, Mama, not even then.

01:41:26.524 --> 01:41:28.317
Hello, Bucky!

01:41:31.195 --> 01:41:34.031
Looks like the wind took some liberties
with this place.

01:41:34.198 --> 01:41:35.949
- Evening, Cap'n!
- Evening, Cap'n!

01:41:36.033 --> 01:41:38.745
- Storm cross over the river?
- Gone to Arkansas.

01:41:38.953 --> 01:41:40.705
Rain do some good, Cap'n?

01:41:40.872 --> 01:41:42.540
Some good, I reckon.

01:41:44.542 --> 01:41:45.835
Some good.

01:41:46.710 --> 01:41:48.420
You could at least read them.

01:41:48.504 --> 01:41:52.300
Put them away before I tear
them up. I don't know what's in them.

01:41:52.383 --> 01:41:53.885
<i>I don't want to know.</i>

01:41:55.469 --> 01:41:56.721
Can I come in?

01:41:58.597 --> 01:42:01.308
Has the storm done any damage?

01:42:01.517 --> 01:42:04.145
Which storm are you talking about?
The one outside...

01:42:04.228 --> 01:42:06.230
<i>or that hullabaloo going on in here?</i>

01:42:14.948 --> 01:42:16.115
Excuse me, sir.

01:42:16.449 --> 01:42:20.953
Heard some mighty loud talking.
What's the powwow about?

01:42:21.328 --> 01:42:24.373
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.

01:42:24.873 --> 01:42:28.002
What's in them important-looking
documents you've got there?

01:42:28.419 --> 01:42:31.088
Nothing.
Nothing much of anything at all.

01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:35.926
Then why are you and Sister
Woman scurrying and scrounging around?

01:42:36.552 --> 01:42:39.097
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.

01:42:42.391 --> 01:42:44.518
What's that smell in this room?

01:42:45.352 --> 01:42:47.104
Didn't you notice it, Brick?

01:42:47.771 --> 01:42:51.567
Didn't you notice the powerful
and obnoxious odor of mendacity?

01:42:55.112 --> 01:42:57.698
Yes, sir, I think I did.

01:42:57.907 --> 01:43:01.285
Ain't nothing more powerful
than the odor of mendacity.

01:43:02.411 --> 01:43:04.872
- Didn't you notice it, Gooper?
- What, sir?

01:43:05.123 --> 01:43:07.166
What about you, Sister Woman?

01:43:07.375 --> 01:43:11.045
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell
of mendacity in this room?

01:43:11.545 --> 01:43:13.839
I don't even know what that is.

01:43:14.047 --> 01:43:17.635
You can smell it. It smells like death.

01:43:22.348 --> 01:43:24.683
What's the matter
with that woman?

01:43:24.767 --> 01:43:26.519
What's-your-name, what's wrong?

01:43:26.686 --> 01:43:29.605
She just had a slight dizzy spell.

01:43:29.814 --> 01:43:32.233
You'd better watch that.
A stroke's a bad way to go.

01:43:35.027 --> 01:43:38.698
Look, he's wearing
Brick's birthday present.

01:43:39.907 --> 01:43:43.494
I haven't given you my present yet
but I will now.

01:43:43.828 --> 01:43:45.579
I have an announcement.

01:43:45.788 --> 01:43:47.623
What kind of an announcement?

01:43:49.082 --> 01:43:51.294
An announcement of life beginning.

01:43:53.838 --> 01:43:55.756
A child is coming...

01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:59.385
sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.

01:44:03.348 --> 01:44:05.641
I have Brick's child in my body.

01:44:06.517 --> 01:44:08.561
And that is my present to you.

01:44:09.019 --> 01:44:12.815
Did you ever in your born days
hear such a bald-faced lie?

01:44:13.023 --> 01:44:14.191
Shut up.

01:44:16.027 --> 01:44:17.403
Thank you.

01:44:17.612 --> 01:44:19.405
Thank you very much.

01:44:32.877 --> 01:44:36.672
Yes, indeed, this girl
has life in her body.

01:44:37.714 --> 01:44:39.384
And that's no lie.

01:44:40.343 --> 01:44:43.763
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!

01:44:45.389 --> 01:44:47.516
- Brick?
- Yes, Big Daddy?

01:44:50.269 --> 01:44:53.314
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

01:44:53.814 --> 01:44:55.941
The place and the people on it.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.611
Ida?

01:45:02.197 --> 01:45:03.658
You want to come with me?

01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:14.209
<i>Brick...</i>

01:45:17.588 --> 01:45:19.799
What were you two talking about
down there?

01:45:19.882 --> 01:45:20.882
Us.

01:45:21.217 --> 01:45:22.384
Me, too?

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:23.927
Yeah.

01:45:24.136 --> 01:45:26.889
You ripped your own brother apart.

01:45:28.224 --> 01:45:29.892
Do you believe that, Gooper?

01:45:34.063 --> 01:45:35.522
- No.
- Well, I do!

01:45:35.731 --> 01:45:36.731
Keep still.

01:45:36.899 --> 01:45:41.195
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

01:45:41.529 --> 01:45:42.989
That's the truth.

01:45:43.239 --> 01:45:44.448
Amen.

01:45:45.449 --> 01:45:48.786
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

01:45:48.952 --> 01:45:50.495
- Be still, Mae.
- She made it up.

01:45:50.579 --> 01:45:53.833
- I said shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us.

01:45:55.334 --> 01:45:57.128
She's not kidding you.

01:45:57.336 --> 01:46:00.756
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even...

01:46:01.006 --> 01:46:02.090
Keep quiet!

01:46:02.174 --> 01:46:05.845
We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

01:46:06.053 --> 01:46:10.557
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

01:46:10.766 --> 01:46:13.852
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

01:46:17.648 --> 01:46:20.818
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

01:46:20.901 --> 01:46:24.655
<i>You heard what Big Daddy said,
"That girl's got life in her body."</i>

01:46:24.738 --> 01:46:26.448
- That's a lie!
- No.

01:46:27.909 --> 01:46:30.494
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

01:46:30.578 --> 01:46:34.039
<i>Believe me, it is desperate,
and she has got it.</i>

01:46:35.708 --> 01:46:38.628
Why don't you
say something, honey?

01:46:39.170 --> 01:46:40.755
All right, honey.

01:46:40.963 --> 01:46:42.048
Shut up!

01:46:42.757 --> 01:46:44.008
Maggie?

01:46:46.343 --> 01:46:47.511
Yes?

01:46:47.678 --> 01:46:49.346
Come on up here.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.724
Yes, sir!

01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:03.695
That girl's got life in her, all right.

01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:09.450
Thank you for keeping still.

01:47:09.783 --> 01:47:11.994
For backing me up in my lie.

01:47:12.453 --> 01:47:13.495
<i>Maggie...</i>

01:47:14.121 --> 01:47:17.875
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:20.920
Lock the door.

01:47:51.383 --> 01:47:59.383
