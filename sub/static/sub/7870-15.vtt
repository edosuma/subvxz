01:21.456 --> 01:23.124
Mom's birthday is tomorrow.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.752
It's time to start your
annual mad dash around town

01:25.835 --> 01:28.379
to get her a present that's
not completely insulting.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.007
You know, sweetie,
there was a time when I would've killed

01:31.091 --> 01:33.885
for that information,
but I'm pleased to announce

01:33.968 --> 01:36.554

I put some thought into it.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.186
(bigger gasp)

01:43.269 --> 01:46.147
It's a state-of-the-art

01:46.231 --> 01:49.150
Wha...?
Mom is gonna love that!

01:49.234 --> 01:51.236
(chuckles) Love?!

01:51.319 --> 01:52.904
Your mom's gonna
feel so good,

01:52.987 --> 01:56.574
it'll make mere love
seem like chewing tinfoil.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.828
Because today,
I'm getting it autographed.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.246
By who? Lenny?

02:01.329 --> 02:04.082
By the box lady herself!

02:04.165 --> 02:06.668

02:06.751 --> 02:10.338
Yeah-ohaa!

02:24.561 --> 02:26.104
"island something."

02:26.187 --> 02:28.731
It's like going to Hawaii
without the murderous locals.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.359
They have jellies made of fruits
I've never heard of!

02:31.442 --> 02:34.320
These'll go great with

02:34.404 --> 02:36.364
Wow, I don't believe
the Simpsons

02:36.447 --> 02:38.032
will be shopping at the
Kwik-E-Mart anymore.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.826
Oh, really?

02:39.909 --> 02:42.495
Apu! What are you doing
out of your natural habitat?

02:42.579 --> 02:44.581

on my store with some

02:47.000 --> 02:48.168

02:48.251 --> 02:50.003
But at the Kwik-E-Mart,
the only fresh fruit

02:50.086 --> 02:52.255
is the one banana
by the register.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.176
You keep your ice cream
right beside the motor oil!

02:56.259 --> 02:58.178
You sell cigarettes to kids.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.096
Now see here,
I have always considered

03:00.180 --> 03:02.098
you cash-giving cows
to be my friends.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.225
And friends do not
betray friends.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.020
Friends are the only
people you can betray!

03:07.103 --> 03:09.397
And you'd do it in a second
for a supermarket

03:09.480 --> 03:11.274
that gives free coffee samples!

Uh-huh.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.324
Would you sign this
for my wife Marge?

04:01.407 --> 04:04.494
She's a big fan
and her birthday is tomorrow.

04:04.577 --> 04:08.122
Uh-hm, you know, while I was
signing this for your wife,

04:08.206 --> 04:10.583
-I just cooked up...

04:15.463 --> 04:17.924
from my show tomorrow
to wish her a happy birthday?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.342
You would do that?!

04:19.425 --> 04:22.929
Oh, my God,
this might be a Marge's birthday

04:23.012 --> 04:24.430
where I get sex!

04:27.058 --> 04:29.227
Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!

04:29.310 --> 04:30.812
Open mine!
Quick, before it suffocates!

04:30.895 --> 04:34.357

I had when I was a girl!

04:34.440 --> 04:35.900
How did you know?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.735
I saw this picture
at Grandma's house,

04:37.819 --> 04:40.405
then I hit the pet stores
till I found one that looked just like it.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.116
Oh, Bart, you got me
the fluffy pet

04:43.199 --> 04:45.326
I've never stopped
thinking about.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.708
Now, last but not least,
your present, Homie.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.919
Oh! (chuckles)
Wait one second, Marge.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.839
Before you open it,
you're gonna get a phone call

04:57.922 --> 05:00.591
that will make this your
most awesome birthday ever.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.468
Well, we're still focused on me

05:02.552 --> 05:05.179
instead of watching golf,
so that's pretty good.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.223
The only golf we'll watch is

05:07.307 --> 05:10.143

two... one...

it's not happening.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.810

05:52.894 --> 05:55.646
Well, at least you
remembered I like her.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.801
All right, chill, bro.
Just chill out.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.345
I will chill you,
right between your damned eyes!

12:01.429 --> 12:03.514
For once, the Indian
has been outsourced!

12:03.597 --> 12:05.641
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.
Just give me the piece.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.060
-No... No...
-You've got a family, dude.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.604
Or were you lying when
you begged for your life?

12:10.688 --> 12:14.650
Oh, sweet Vishnu the Destroyer,
what have I done?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.778
Dude, it's okay. The jails,
they don't have room for us now.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.031
Wiggum just makes you do
book reports for Ralph.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.576
But you have to make 'em
so it looks like he's done it.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.161
That's... that's
kinda the hard part.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.079
Where's this 2006 Beaujolais

12:27.163 --> 12:28.873
that's puttin' me out of business?

12:28.956 --> 12:31.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's a white wine?

12:31.292 --> 12:34.128
And wha-- and a Swiss cheese?
And a peanut butter?

12:34.211 --> 12:36.130
And a potato chip?
And toilet paper?

12:36.213 --> 12:37.548
Wha-what?!

12:39.341 --> 12:43.012
Yo, mysterious pranksters,
it's time for dinner.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.472
Damn it, she knows!

12:44.555 --> 12:46.307
Okay, how do we
buy your silence?

12:46.390 --> 12:48.893
Just throw in a couple of
"fur is murders."

12:48.976 --> 12:51.312
How is fur murder?
They're just animals.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.480
Dad!

12:52.563 --> 12:54.231
Fine. Fur is murder.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.150
Everything's murder.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.152

Bart, you've really
grown as an artist.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.470
Thanks, Milhouse.
We make a great team.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.805
Hold it right there!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.765
The jerk in the glasses
did everything!

13:27.848 --> 13:31.143
-Whoa!
-Waah! Need... inhaler...

13:31.227 --> 13:32.561
(gasps)

13:32.645 --> 13:35.105
(coughs)

13:35.189 --> 13:36.482
Oh, God, man!

13:36.565 --> 13:38.859
Here, drink this paint thinner.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.326
So you're the two punks
who've been tagging the town.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.994
Congratulations.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.163
-BOTH: Huh?
-We're street artists.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.250
Take that, Ronald Reagan!

13:54.333 --> 13:56.126
Even in death,
you're not safe from me.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.090
Is that graffiti or are you
opening up a Mommy and Me?

14:01.173 --> 14:05.094
That's it. You just got yourself
a place on the wall, kid.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.138
Nooo!
I've been satirized!

14:08.222 --> 14:09.890
Who are you guys?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.642
Kenny Scharf, Robbie Conal.

14:11.725 --> 14:12.810
I'm Shepard Fairey.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.646
(chuckles)
What was that name again?

14:15.729 --> 14:16.772
Shepard Fairey.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.190
NELSON (distant):
Haw-haw!

14:18.274 --> 14:19.608
(laughing)

14:19.692 --> 14:22.069
I'm the guy who created
the Obama "Hope" poster,

14:22.152 --> 14:23.821
and the "Obey" stickers.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.990
Man, you're the talkiest
bullies I ever met.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.158
We're not bullies,
we're artists.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.201
And so are you.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.496
Urban vandalism is now
the hottest art form there is.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.331
Hey, I got an F in art.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.917
Mainly so it would say
"fart" on my report card.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.419
(dog howls)

14:38.502 --> 14:40.880
Bart, we would love
to set up a gallery show

14:40.963 --> 14:41.839
for your street art.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.258
Well, if it's in a gallery,
how is it street art?

14:44.341 --> 14:47.511
Bart, street art is not about
questioning authority.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.306
Well, I'll have to discuss it
with my partner.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.182
Bart, say yes!

14:52.266 --> 14:54.226
At the opening,
I could wear a sports jacket

14:54.310 --> 14:56.020
with a T-shirt and jeans!

14:56.103 --> 14:58.105
First, I'm not sure
you have the shoulders for it,

14:58.188 --> 15:01.275
and second, maybe we've
pushed this far enough.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.735
<i>(laughing)</i>

15:02.818 --> 15:05.446
<i>I put you in a rabbit cage!</i>

15:05.529 --> 15:10.409
<i>I poked your flab back in,</i>
<i>square by square.</i>

15:10.492 --> 15:13.537
(growls)
Count me in.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.372
(siren wailing)

15:15.456 --> 15:16.999
(tires screeching)

15:17.082 --> 15:19.543
Apu! It is a miracle!

15:19.627 --> 15:21.503
What now?
Swapper Jack is reuniting

15:21.587 --> 15:22.963
Led Zeppelin in aisle six?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.632
Swapper Jack's is closing!

15:24.715 --> 15:26.300
No. Do not give me
false hope,

15:26.383 --> 15:28.302
like the time they said
it was only sextuplets.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.930
It is true!
Every successful corporation

15:31.013 --> 15:32.890
harbors a terrible secret.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.310
Theirs is that what they sell
as chicken is actually monkey.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.729
-But the drumsticks...
-Stunted monkey tails.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.148
-And their chicken pot pie?
-Monkey pot pie!

15:41.231 --> 15:42.399
But how 'bout their
rotisserie chi--

15:42.483 --> 15:43.943
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

15:44.026 --> 15:46.779
They scoop them up off
the streets of Brazil!

15:46.862 --> 15:48.155
So, we have won.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.907
Finally I am lucky at something.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.992
You were lucky at love.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.744
Yeah, sure, baby.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.247
Hey, Bart, check this out.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.250
Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso!

16:00.334 --> 16:02.127
(laughing)

16:02.211 --> 16:05.005
It's funny 'cause
it's so preposterous.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.674
(nervous laughing)
Yeah.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.677
-Hmm...
-We've hit the big time!

16:09.760 --> 16:11.428
"I, Carumba"?!

16:11.512 --> 16:13.347
Not so loud.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.765
If my dad
hears about the show,

16:14.848 --> 16:17.267
he might realize
Mr. Fatso is him.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.686
What the...?

16:18.769 --> 16:21.021
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>You idiot. Mr. Fatso is you!</i>

16:21.105 --> 16:23.190
What? No. It can't be.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.109
<i>That's right, numbskull.</i>

16:25.192 --> 16:28.946
<i>Your son's made a fool of you</i>
<i>in front of the whole town.</i>

16:29.029 --> 16:31.281
Shut up! I'll fix you!

16:31.365 --> 16:33.742
(gulping)

16:33.826 --> 16:36.286
<i>Well, I'll fix you.</i>

16:36.370 --> 16:38.122
<i>Go drive a car!</i>

16:38.205 --> 16:40.332
Yes, master.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.459
Here, car!
Here, boy!

16:47.214 --> 16:49.633
Excellent installation, dude.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.970
And a great excuse for me
to bust out my courtroom jacket.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.430
Thanks, guys. I, um...

16:54.513 --> 16:58.058
Ooh, this collar's feeling
pretty tight.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.811
(grunts)
Help! Help!

17:00.894 --> 17:02.604
(posters growling)

17:02.688 --> 17:05.399
Oh, this is just a dream.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.192
All I have to do is wake up.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.778
-Why, you little...
-(choking)

17:09.862 --> 17:11.780
Pay for your genius!

17:11.864 --> 17:14.199
Oh, what's the use?

17:14.283 --> 17:18.328
When a man isn't a hero
to his son, he's nothing.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.133
I like what used to make
a neighborhood look dangerous

17:31.216 --> 17:32.801
now makes it look sophisticated.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.095
I like how the painting
makes more than I do.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.930
Looks like Dad's not coming.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.640
He won't leave the car.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.770
I can see how this show
might not be to his liking.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.565
Come on, Dad.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.901
You made me mad,
so I got back at you.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.361
How was I to know
parents had feelings?

17:51.445 --> 17:53.197
Well, we do.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.949
I want to show you
I understand how you feel.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.452
And they say a picture's
worth a 1,000 words.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.666
You just ruined my car.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.461
Correction, it's worth
ten times as much.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.838
$500! Whoo-hoo!

18:09.922 --> 18:11.673
-Thanks, boy.
-You're welcome.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.551
And from now on, Dad,
if anyone laughs at you,

18:14.635 --> 18:16.136
they've gotta go through me.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.846
Really? Anyone?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.474
What about the Hulk
riding a rhinoceros?

18:20.557 --> 18:22.142
Would you stop him
from laughing?

18:22.226 --> 18:25.395
Wait, is the Hulk laughing,
or the rhinoceros?

18:25.479 --> 18:27.773
Both, but the rhinoceros
doesn't know why.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.066
He's just trying to fit in.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.568
Dad, it's getting
cold out here.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.488
-(clinking glass)
-Art lovers and Bart lovers!

18:34.571 --> 18:36.698
First of all, I'd like to thank
the good folks

18:36.782 --> 18:39.326
at <i>Springfield Arts Daily</i>
for setting this up.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.037
Thank you for bringing us
a fresh new voice.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.748
-(chuckles) Yes..
-Yes... yes.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.085
As a graffiti artist, there are
so many people to thank...

18:48.168 --> 18:49.962
people who build walls...

18:50.045 --> 18:53.006
nighttime, for being dark...

18:53.090 --> 18:56.426
Hold it right there,
Spray-candy Warhol!

18:56.510 --> 18:58.011
(gun cocks)

19:00.597 --> 19:03.600
Bart Simpson, you're under arrest
for tagging the town.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.061
This overdue art-quake
that taught us all

19:06.145 --> 19:07.855
a new way of seeing, was actually

19:07.938 --> 19:09.773
a police department sting.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.191
It was?

19:11.275 --> 19:13.277
Yeah. Do you think people
would be stupid enough

19:13.360 --> 19:14.987
to pay for something
some amateur

19:15.070 --> 19:16.280
put on a wall for nothing?

19:16.363 --> 19:18.198
Oh, no, indeed!

19:18.282 --> 19:21.201
Now if I can just get
my $3,000,000 back.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.452
No refunds.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.246
But he just said
the show was a sham.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.456
Oh, it is. And I'm just
a guy sitting at a table.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.042
The only thing that's real
is the sign that says "no refunds."

19:29.126 --> 19:30.878
Ooh...

19:30.961 --> 19:32.880
Wait, Chief. I must know...

19:32.963 --> 19:34.214
who tipped you off?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.716
Eh, probably shouldn't
tell you this,

19:35.799 --> 19:38.427
but, uh, it was
our undercover officer,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.470
Shepard Fairey.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.557
You're an undercover cop?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.767
Hey, don't be so surprised.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.188
I spent 20 years putting up
posters that said "obey."

19:49.271 --> 19:50.731
What gives, Daddy-O?

19:50.814 --> 19:54.026
I thought you were the dean
of the underground scene.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.945
I'm not in the business of
helping out posers anymore.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.488
Now, I just sell stuff to them.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.075
Wait, wait, wait!

20:02.159 --> 20:03.493
He's just a boy.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.245
Do you have to put him in jail?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.831
Well, we've gotta teach
him a lesson somehow.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.666
Hmm...

20:09.750 --> 20:13.503
Chief, I believe I have the answer
in the back of my car.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.424
Hm!

20:19.343 --> 20:20.761
There you go.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.429
Thanks for coming out.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.309
I need to go
to the bathroom.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.894
Uh, knock yourself out.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.856
All right, time's up!

20:34.066 --> 20:36.235
Aw, aw, aw, no!

20:36.318 --> 20:38.987
(acapella theme)

21:21.697 --> 21:23.365
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
