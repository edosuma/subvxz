00:00.460 --> 00:01.819
previously  on "one tree hill"...

00:01.940 --> 00:03.230
Were you robbed?Last night.

00:03.330 --> 00:05.370
You can't tell anyone,okay?

00:05.440 --> 00:07.710
Deb,you own a gun,right?

00:07.810 --> 00:09.770
I want you to teach me how to use it.

00:09.850 --> 00:10.860
Shoplift much?

00:10.940 --> 00:12.780
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:12.880 --> 00:13.950
What are you doing?!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.770
Get off me,bitch!

00:15.980 --> 00:20.120
I am  going to do the worlda fakir and ll you,

00:20.250 --> 00:23.180
but first,I'm gonna get jamie back.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.480
And you're gonna help me.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.460
Where do you think you're going?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.920
Apparently,my mom's dating some freak she met online.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.170
I'm gonna find out who this jerk is.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.330
And when I do,it's gonna get ugly.

00:38.460 --> 00:41.390
I used to put all my little treasures in here.Now you can,too.

00:41.510 --> 00:42.870
Can you help me make a cape?

00:43.010 --> 00:44.220
Quentin really likes mine.

00:44.350 --> 00:47.610
I thought maybe we could make one for him,too.

00:49.070 --> 00:50.970
Have a nice night.

00:53.780 --> 00:54.580
Oh,my god.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.290
Lucas,what is it?

00:56.470 --> 00:58.130
Quentin fields was shot tonight

00:59.940 --> 01:00.940
he's dead.

01:10.790 --> 01:13.500
Quentin fields  was a basketball player.

01:13.650 --> 01:20.430
He was also a son,a brother,somebody's teammate,somebody's friend.

01:20.550 --> 01:22.570
I didn't know quentin fields.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.820
I guess now I never will.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.070
Hey,did anybody call you?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.560
Yeah.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.340
Is it true?

01:32.520 --> 01:36.170
Is quentin really -- is he dead?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.730
Yeah.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.780

Did you ever wonder  what it would be like  if you weren't you anymore?

02:00.700 --> 02:05.000
If you were suddenly gone,how would your world react?

02:08.030 --> 02:09.350
where the hell are you,man?

02:09.509 --> 02:11.790
Please tell me I didn't drag myself out of bed for nothing.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.440
Call me back.

02:13.980 --> 02:16.350
Whatever you imagined is wrong.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.330
Hey,what are you doing here?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.600
Haley,what happened?

02:24.780 --> 02:27.610
There's nothing romantic  about death.

02:28.290 --> 02:30.170
Grief is like the ocean.

02:30.230 --> 02:34.080
It's deep and dark  and bigger than all of us.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.460
And pain is like  inthief  the night.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.280
What am I gonna tell my students?

02:56.820 --> 02:58.330
What am I gonna tell jamie?

02:58.420 --> 03:00.070
He loves quentin.

03:00.270 --> 03:02.280
He'S...making him a cape.

03:04.510 --> 03:07.020
- I'll do it.
- No.

03:09.470 --> 03:11.410
We should do it together.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.600
Hey,coach luke's back.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.480
What's happening,coach?

03:21.330 --> 03:24.640
Hey,guys,uh...

03:25.760 --> 03:27.430
...we have to tell you something.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.660
What's wrong,mama?

03:32.550 --> 03:34.530
It's about quentin,son.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.710
Listen... quentin had an accident,jamie.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.710
What kind of accident?

03:46.820 --> 03:48.530
Is he gonna be okay?

03:48.690 --> 03:51.240
No,he's not okay.He,um...

03:53.050 --> 03:58.140
his -- his body stopped working,and he's gone now.

03:59.020 --> 04:00.340
He's gone to heaven,okay?

04:00.430 --> 04:03.120
And we're not gonna be able to see him anymore.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.550
What about the ravens?

04:04.650 --> 04:06.230
Isn't he gonna play anymore?

04:06.340 --> 04:09.600
Jamie...he died,honey.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.180
He can't play anymore.

04:13.130 --> 04:16.700
And mommy and daddy are incredibly sad about it.

04:17.269 --> 04:20.260
So it's okay if you're sad,too.

04:20.370 --> 04:23.850
I know that he loved you very much,

04:23.990 --> 04:27.140
and I know that you're gonna miss him.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.600
And we're really gonna miss him,too.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.110
But what about his cape?

04:32.220 --> 04:36.780
Jamie,he'S... jamie,honey,listen to me.

04:37.570 --> 04:40.400
He's gonna like it.You'll see.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.020
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.890
Hey,guys,I'm sorry.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.100
There's been a misunderstanding,okay?

04:58.210 --> 05:00.090
These -- these clothesare  frnot ee!

05:00.720 --> 05:02.460
Just taking inventory.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.680
Brooke davis,have you lost your mind?!

05:08.780 --> 05:10.120
It's my store.They're my clothes.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.500
I can do what I want with them.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.430
But what are you doing?

05:13.510 --> 05:14.540
We're having a sale.

05:14.650 --> 05:17.930
For one day,and one day only,everything in the store is freakin' free!

05:18.040 --> 05:20.010
No!

05:20.100 --> 05:22.020
Do you want to talk about it?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.550
Haley told me about your mom.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.810
No,as a matter of fact,i don't want to talk about it.

05:26.850 --> 05:28.080
There's nothing left to say,peyton.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.390
My mom's a bitch!

05:29.520 --> 05:32.110
She's a horrible,selfish bitch!

05:33.090 --> 05:34.670
Happy now?Was that a good talk?

05:34.640 --> 05:35.830
Why are you yelling at me?

05:35.930 --> 05:38.400
I'm gonna need my key back,too.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.770
What?

05:39.900 --> 05:41.270
My house key?

05:41.380 --> 05:42.930
You moved out,right?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.250
I can't have people coming and going like it's some kind of rachel gatina crack den.

05:46.310 --> 05:51.520
Okay,brooke,I understand that you're upset,but is there something else that's going on?

05:52.360 --> 05:55.340
I just need to feel safe in my house,that's all.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.530
So I need your key.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.240
Fine.

06:01.770 --> 06:03.280
What do you want,peyton?

06:03.390 --> 06:05.970
What is it that you are doing here?

06:06.030 --> 06:12.030
I came here to tell you that one of lucas' basketball players was killed last night.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.900
Quentin fields.

06:14.010 --> 06:15.800
And luke's a mess.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.760
I just thought you'd want to know.

06:47.590 --> 06:48.990
I don't know what to say to any of you.

06:49.070 --> 06:53.570
I didn't know what to say to my 5-year-old son who loved quentin

06:53.890 --> 06:55.630
just as much as many of you do.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.090
- So,um,if you want to talk about how you're feeling -
- what's the point?

07:03.670 --> 07:05.410
I mean,he's gone,right?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.320
Some idiot just shot him,and now he's gone forever.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.460
So what's the point?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.300
There is no point.

07:21.910 --> 07:24.600
You think you can fool me,huh?

07:24.850 --> 07:30.370
You think you can spoil my plan to get jamie back with your stupid defective heart?

07:30.480 --> 07:32.070
Well,you can'T.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.800
I have a new plan.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.970
I'm not gonna have to take afjamie L.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.750
Ter al he's gonna come right to me.

07:40.990 --> 07:43.080
And why would he do that?

07:44.240 --> 07:47.480
Oh,because poor grandpa dan is dying,

07:47.610 --> 07:52.470
and his last dying wish is to say goodbye to his sweet little grandson.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.410
And then what?

07:55.010 --> 07:57.520
In a few months,I'll be dead,

07:57.630 --> 08:01.790
and when they can't find jamie,they'll start looking for you.

08:02.020 --> 08:05.280
anthen you'll be the fugitive that you don't want to be.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.850
I've decided I can live with that.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.950
By then,I'll have a six-month head start with my son.

08:12.260 --> 08:15.280
When life gives you lemons,you can't be a sourpuss.

08:15.420 --> 08:16.550
It won't work.

08:16.690 --> 08:19.310
They won't bring jamie to see me.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.200
In case you've forgotten,I'm a murderer,remember?

08:23.570 --> 08:27.560
Besides,my grandson's afraid of me.

08:27.670 --> 08:31.560
Oh... not according to this.

08:31.830 --> 08:34.020
Found this in your jacket.

08:36.309 --> 08:41.080
Looks like jamie loved you  almost as much as he loves me.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.050
What's he gonna do?Drive himself out here?

08:46.210 --> 08:48.390
What are you gonna do about the person who brings him?

08:48.470 --> 08:53.320
Well,I sincerely hope it's haley,but I'm not gonna do anything.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.740
Dan scott,however,is going to kill that person.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.750
At least that's what it'll look like.

09:00.030 --> 09:05.700
I mean,in case you've forgotten,you're a murderer,remember?

09:09.230 --> 09:11.620
I was gonna tell him I was proud of him.

09:13.490 --> 09:16.360
You know,last night when you came by the office --

09:16.480 --> 09:18.810
I said,"I'll just talk to q tomorrow.

09:19.870 --> 09:25.600
" I was gonna tell him how far he's come and how proud I was of him for that.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.500
You're supposed to get tomorrow,you know?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.670
That kid was just 17 years old.

09:33.810 --> 09:36.040
His life hadn't even started yet.

09:36.340 --> 09:40.740
And the phone rings in the middle of the night,and he's just...gone.

09:42.020 --> 09:43.920
It's just wrong,luke.

09:45.070 --> 09:47.180
It's impossible and just wrong.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.640
I feel like I let him down.

09:54.120 --> 09:59.410
I asked him to be a good example and a good teammate.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.730
And then I go and get suspended?

10:04.160 --> 10:06.230
Yeah,but you was defending him,though.

10:06.370 --> 10:08.530
I was failing him.

10:12.390 --> 10:14.390
He's got a little brother.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.380
He's got parents.

10:18.610 --> 10:21.390
How does a mother ever breathe again?

11:02.650 --> 11:04.770
can I have this?

11:08.270 --> 11:10.550
I think he'd like that.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.660
I like your beach house,by the way.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.810
Amazing view.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.210
Yes,I've been there.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.330
Where do you think I got your gun from?

11:50.410 --> 11:55.220
Bedside table,under the suburban-filth catalog.

11:56.010 --> 11:59.690
Their bras are sexy,huh?

12:03.530 --> 12:05.800
Why don't you have kids?

12:05.890 --> 12:11.610
You're young,attractive,crazy as a craphouse rat,but still...

12:13.140 --> 12:15.910
you could have a little boy of your own.

12:16.010 --> 12:18.050
Hell,I might even be able to help you out.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.640
I am really going to enjoy killing you.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.990
Stay in the yard,okay?

13:11.550 --> 13:13.450
They gave me a present.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.340
What are you playing?

13:15.530 --> 13:17.160
Basketball.

13:19.650 --> 13:21.000
What's your name?

13:21.130 --> 13:23.500
James lucas scott.What's yours?

13:23.570 --> 13:29.890
Well,everyone calls me dre,but my real name is brandon andre fields.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.290
Quentin was my brother.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.980
Quentin was my friend.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.710
I'm making him a cape.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.510
Coach scott... I'm quentin's mother -- denice.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.360
Ma'am.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.250
I wanted to thank you for standing up for my boy the way you did in that last game.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.670
It's a shame that we have to meet like this.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.820
Yes,ma'am,it is.

14:05.200 --> 14:10.280
Coach taylor... quentin always had so many nice thingay ato sbout you,

14:10.280 --> 14:12.940
and you,too,nathan.

14:13.290 --> 14:16.500
I really appreciate you boys coming here,

14:16.710 --> 14:21.020
but I mostly wanted to say thank you to this one.

14:21.510 --> 14:24.560
My son has always loved basketball.

14:24.830 --> 14:28.780
But I got to tell you -- when I came home and found him reading a book,

14:28.910 --> 14:31.320
it just about gave me a heart attack.

14:31.820 --> 14:35.140
He said,"mama,mrs.James scott,she don't play.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.060
" He said,"she almost as bad as you are.

14:39.660 --> 14:44.360
" I realize that you were all trying to help my boy live up to the greatness that god gave him,

14:44.480 --> 14:48.030
and you should be proud of that.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.470
Your strength is inspiring.

14:57.940 --> 15:01.730
My strength is from jesus christ.

15:03.590 --> 15:07.950
I am gonna miss my baby boy for the rest of this life.

15:14.020 --> 15:17.450
But I know we are gonna see him again,

15:17.630 --> 15:20.840
and our faith will see us through.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.540
I'm gonna be a musician when I grow up.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.620
I'm gonna play basketball.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.170
Yeah,I might do that,too.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.030
My mom makes the best spaghetti in the world.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.400
My mom makes good macand oni cheese.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.140
My grandpa can whistle really loud.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.990
My grandma deb wears really tight pants.

15:46.090 --> 15:48.210
My favorite animal is a cheetah.

15:48.320 --> 15:53.570
Mine's a rabbit... or a tiger... or a raven.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.760
Yeah,a raven.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.880
I'm not going in there.

15:59.970 --> 16:01.830
It's too sad.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.860
What color is the cape?

16:05.950 --> 16:07.330
Red.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.390
Cool.

16:09.650 --> 16:12.860
Jamie,come on,buddy,time to go.

16:14.620 --> 16:15.820
Bye.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.420
Bye.

16:29.950 --> 16:32.970
I'll be right back.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.600
You're a good boy,you know that?

17:06.589 --> 17:09.230
Everyone's just kind of hanging out downstairs.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.440
Yeah.

17:11.630 --> 17:15.000
I just thought maybe jamie wanted to finish this.

17:19.190 --> 17:23.359
I was also thinking that maybe he shouldn't go to the funeral.

17:24.569 --> 17:28.210
It's just gonna be so sad and final.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.920
Well,that's what death is,hales.

17:31.040 --> 17:35.590
I know,but he's 5 years old,and he still sees a better world than we do.

17:35.710 --> 17:39.440
Well,not to mention wakes and funerals really creep me out.

17:40.730 --> 17:45.290
Yeah,for you,it's clowns.For me,it's old dead guys.

17:48.770 --> 17:54.590
You know,my,uh... my mom's grandfather died when I was around jamie's age.

17:54.730 --> 17:58.860
And so my whole family's at the wake,and we're kneeling in front of the casket.

17:58.910 --> 18:04.970
And I'm really scared because there's this old dead guy just a few feet away from me.

18:05.480 --> 18:10.340
Anyway,my mom's crying,and,uh,my dad -- he says a couple of words,

18:10.390 --> 18:13.660
and then he leans forward,and he kisses the corpse.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.590
And now I'm totally freaked out.

18:16.790 --> 18:22.250
And then,he turns to me,and he says,"kiss your great grandfather,son.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.410
" He didn't make you?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.950
Yeah.It's my dad.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.960
"Kiss the 100-year-old dead guy in makeup.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.720
Dan sucks.

18:35.830 --> 18:37.130
Yeah.

18:38.330 --> 18:40.090
Maybe you're right.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.000
Maybe jamie should sit this one out.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.730
I'm so sorry.

18:52.950 --> 18:54.910
I wanted to see you as soon as I found out.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.130
It's okay.

18:56.230 --> 18:57.590
Thank you,though.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.710
You must be devastated.

18:59.840 --> 19:04.020
I just feel numb,like I'm in a bad dream,and I just want to wake up.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.230
I just want q to wake up.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.560
Did they --

19:08.790 --> 19:12.180
have they found the person responsible?

19:12.370 --> 19:14.110
I don't think so.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.640
Look,I probably should be getting back downstairs.

19:16.730 --> 19:19.810
I don't want to make the day worse for you,nate,or somebody else.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.950
Okay....

19:28.740 --> 19:32.610
********

19:33.450 --> 19:35.060
Yeah,you here.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.880
Q gone.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.630
And... I'm someplace else.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.990
it's just so hard to accept that things like this happen,

20:03.110 --> 20:07.340
and not just to quentin,but at all -- ever.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.740
One out of every 500 people gets assaulted or raped.

20:13.220 --> 20:16.510
There were 30,000 aggravated assaults in our state alone last year,

20:16.590 --> 20:21.010
7,000 robberies,3,000 murders,600 rapes.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.240
It's official.Like sucks,and then you die.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.980
I'm sorry.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.600
it's a tragedy.I know it is.I'm sorry.

20:34.730 --> 20:37.010
Excuse me.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.240
I'm so sorry about that.

20:49.350 --> 20:51.210
- Do I need to go talk to jamie?
- No,he'll be fine.

20:52.070 --> 20:54.380
You can talk to me,though.

20:57.650 --> 20:59.630
I'm just going through a lot.

21:00.530 --> 21:04.530
Saying goodbye to angie,and victoria trying to take the company.

21:05.060 --> 21:08.340
And then I... fall down the stairs.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.490
And now this.

21:10.710 --> 21:13.380
It's just a lot.

21:15.210 --> 21:20.380
there was a therapist that nathan and I went to when we were having some problems.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.520
She really helped.

21:22.650 --> 21:25.110
I can give you her number if you want.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.400
okay.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.930
Okay.Good.

21:37.070 --> 21:39.390
I'm really sorry about everything.

21:41.410 --> 21:44.050
Must have been some fall down the stairs.Does it hurt?

21:46.060 --> 21:48.590
it all hurts.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.140
Get your filthy,

22:48.250 --> 22:51.010
murdering hands away from my son!

23:08.170 --> 23:10.050
I don't know what to say to them.

23:10.140 --> 23:14.300
I'm 22 years old,and I'm supposed to make sense out of all this for my students?

23:15.800 --> 23:18.110
I c-- I can'T.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.350
you reached quentin.

23:30.670 --> 23:33.040
you'll reach them,too.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.140
what's your name?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.540
Sam -- samantha walker.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.270
I'm new.

23:52.460 --> 23:55.160
Can you just take that desk in the back,please?

23:55.300 --> 23:57.140
Why?What's wrong with this one?

23:57.250 --> 23:59.480
That desk is taken.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.230
Quentin,uh... was a great kid.

24:22.930 --> 24:26.440
he was the leader of this team,and I know that he was your friend.

24:28.100 --> 24:32.190
I wish... I could take this pain away,.

24:33.660 --> 24:36.500
but I can'T And I'm sorry.

24:38.620 --> 24:40.460
It's okay to feel angry.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.620
It's okay to feel pain.

24:42.830 --> 24:47.420
It's even okay to hate the person that did this,but when that anger and --

24:47.510 --> 24:52.490
and that pain and that hate becomes too much for you,you come see me,nate,or luke.

24:53.220 --> 24:55.040
Understand?

24:55.200 --> 24:58.800
We are your family,and we gonna get through this together.

24:59.100 --> 25:03.820
You guys know that q was working out with me,helping me with my game.

25:04.690 --> 25:06.920
And that's how I'm gonna remember him --

25:07.040 --> 25:10.810
strong,happy,playing the game he loved.

25:11.230 --> 25:16.210
I want you all to find your own best memories of q and hold onto them

25:16.830 --> 25:21.360
'cause that's where he still lives,and he always will.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.550
Peyton?

25:33.750 --> 25:35.210
Still moving in?

25:35.330 --> 25:36.540
Yeah.

25:36.720 --> 25:41.520
I'm -- I'm just trying to keep busy eep busy and stay preoccupied.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.500
I brought you something.

25:44.850 --> 25:46.050
Brooke,it's fine.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.520
No,I'm really sorry.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.550
It was a total "f-you" transfer from victoria to you,and you didn't deserve it.

25:51.660 --> 25:53.420
It's fine.

25:53.530 --> 25:56.280
Is that why you threw all your pretty clothes out in the street?

25:56.380 --> 25:58.490
Kind of.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.860
Victoria wants the line that bad,she can have it,you know?

26:03.510 --> 26:05.620
Life's too short.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.940
Hey,I got something for you,too.

26:15.890 --> 26:20.960
so,I had to wrestle two really strong women and a kid in a wheelchair for the couture stuff,

26:21.050 --> 26:23.700
but most of it's there.

26:28.940 --> 26:30.860
you can keep them.

26:33.250 --> 26:38.920
life's too short,brooke,to fight,to be miserable...

26:40.260 --> 26:43.360
to let the bitter ones change how awesome you are.

26:50.670 --> 26:51.790
you know what?

26:52.280 --> 26:57.960
Um... you guys asked me what the point was to all of this school and literature -- life.

26:58.090 --> 27:00.920
And,uh,I said there was no a point.

27:01.630 --> 27:03.800
And that's not true.

27:04.260 --> 27:08.580
What I should have said was,"I don't know,"

27:08.670 --> 27:14.560
because the truth is,not long ago,I sat right where you are and wondered exactly the same things.

27:15.620 --> 27:18.700
When something that's tragic and evil

27:18.790 --> 27:22.800
and unexplainable happens like losing someone forever...

27:24.500 --> 27:26.640
...I still wonder...

27:27.650 --> 27:29.730
just like you do.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.750
All right,everybody,get out a piece of paper and a pen.

27:33.830 --> 27:35.570
Why?

27:35.720 --> 27:38.300
Because this is a literature class.

27:42.520 --> 27:48.920
When archaeologists uncover lost civilizations and they unearth these worlds that have long since been destroyed,

27:49.030 --> 27:51.850
you know what they find most often?

27:52.130 --> 27:55.870
They find stories -- ancient languages,words,

27:55.940 --> 28:00.260
inscriptions from people who've been gone for thousands of years

28:00.380 --> 28:01.810
because chances are,they,

28:01.900 --> 28:07.330
like you,they wanted to know,"what's the point?

28:08.590 --> 28:11.130
And they wanted us to know that they were here,you know?

28:11.200 --> 28:15.240
Like... they told their stories,

28:15.340 --> 28:20.910
and they tried to make sense out of their lives and their worlds and their tragedies.

28:21.740 --> 28:24.420
So that's what we're gonna do.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.040
So I want you to write something,anything at all,

28:28.060 --> 28:30.440
about quentin fields.

28:30.580 --> 28:33.770
If you knew him,write a favorite memory.

28:33.890 --> 28:38.970
If you didn't know him,write what you think the point is of all this for yourself

28:39.070 --> 28:42.750
and your life and your time here.

28:44.970 --> 28:47.240
This is a literature class,and that's what writers do.

28:47.410 --> 28:51.460
We put pen to paper in times of devastating tragedy.

28:51.820 --> 28:54.250
And we just try and make sense of it.

28:55.350 --> 28:58.460
Maybe we'll find clarity in some of those words.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.460
Maybe we'll find peace.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.220
who wrote this?

29:07.410 --> 29:09.090
I did.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.490
Give me your marker.

29:26.150 --> 29:29.740
"He who does not weep does not see.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.650
" What's the from?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.370
"Les mis ables.

29:36.070 --> 29:38.280
" "The miserable ones.

29:42.870 --> 29:44.850
who's next?

29:54.790 --> 29:56.570
nice shirt.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.060
Clothes over bros,right?

30:19.680 --> 30:22.130
How come you're getting dressed up again?

30:23.450 --> 30:26.410
Because,uh,mommy and daddy are gonna go to quentin's funeral,

30:26.480 --> 30:28.750
and you're gonna go to the sitter's,remember?

30:29.010 --> 30:32.400
And what happens there,exactly -- at the funeral?

30:36.300 --> 30:39.190
We're gonna say goodbye to quentin,honey.

30:53.630 --> 30:55.330
Jamie loved Q.

30:55.490 --> 30:59.590
It's got to be hard for nathan and haley to explain it all to him,you know?

30:59.740 --> 31:04.040
Well,maybe after they explain it to him,they can explain it to me.

31:05.350 --> 31:06.730
How's the team doing?

31:06.840 --> 31:08.060
Not so good.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.550
I mean,I wouldn't be surprised if they forfeit the rest of the season.

31:14.250 --> 31:18.390
It's really nice having you here,especially now.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.410
I know we haven't really talked much about the wedding.

31:21.550 --> 31:23.980
Oh,god,luke,the wedding can wait.

31:24.130 --> 31:27.770
I mean,this is what a marriage is,right -- the good times and the bad?

31:28.070 --> 31:30.600
I just wish I could help you somehow.

31:31.250 --> 31:35.470
Peyton,you help me so much without saying a word.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.830
And I love you.

31:55.670 --> 31:57.040
who is it?

31:57.200 --> 31:59.060
Nathan.

32:04.860 --> 32:06.410
hi,nate.

32:06.910 --> 32:08.580
Come on in.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.620
It's a tough day,huh?

32:17.210 --> 32:18.490
Yeah.

32:18.630 --> 32:23.430
I wish there was something I could do for you or haley or jamie.

32:23.560 --> 32:27.580
Well,actually,we were wondering if there's anything we could do for you.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.710
How do you mea why me?

32:29.770 --> 32:32.480
Well,I know that your mom has been pulling some stuff with the company,

32:32.530 --> 32:36.520
and -- I don't know -- and I guess having dealt with parent insanity,

32:36.580 --> 32:41.200
I just wanted to check your head and see how you're doing.

32:41.970 --> 32:43.470
I'm fine.

32:43.610 --> 32:44.830
Really.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.110
That sounds like something I would say.

32:47.210 --> 32:53.680
Look,this thing with losing quentin is -- it's hard.

32:53.920 --> 32:58.090
And I have a feeling it's gonna be a pretty prominent thing in our lives for a while.

32:58.170 --> 33:01.780
It doesn't mean that your problems are any less important,

33:02.060 --> 33:04.860
that all of us aren't here for you.

33:07.370 --> 33:09.730
- Look,like I said -
- you're fine.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.990
You can handle it.

33:11.210 --> 33:13.210
It's all good.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.460
Look,I hope that's true,and maybe it is,but...

33:18.780 --> 33:22.050
the thing is,the two of us have been down very similar roads.

33:22.140 --> 33:23.480
I mean,we were in the same cliques first.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.880
We both felt the same pressures,same expectations.

33:26.990 --> 33:29.540
Our parents were like children,

33:29.650 --> 33:35.050
and we both grew into kind of bad versions of ourselves way too fast.

33:35.460 --> 33:38.230
So I think you know I get it.

33:39.590 --> 33:43.780
They never really gave us a chance,did they -- our parents?

33:44.500 --> 33:46.520
They didn't know how.

33:47.350 --> 33:51.240
Look,the thing is,you made your dream happen,all right?

33:51.320 --> 33:54.750
And even though I didn't quite get there,

33:54.850 --> 33:58.480
when it was taken away from me,I dealt with it alone.

33:58.590 --> 34:01.340
That was stupid,selfish,and wrong.

34:01.870 --> 34:07.030
So if your mom tries to take your dream away
from you and you feel that same pain I did

34:07.620 --> 34:10.320
I've sort of been there,okay?

34:10.429 --> 34:13.600
I'm gonna be kind of kissed off if you don't come talk to me about it.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.969
Anyway,thank you for coming today.It means a lot.

34:19.330 --> 34:21.380
I know you didn't know quentin,but....

34:21.929 --> 34:26.120
it doesn't surprise me that you're thinking
about other people when all this stuff is going on with you.

34:26.409 --> 34:29.380
That's not bad for a girl who never had a chance.

34:31.389 --> 34:33.300
came here

35:01.170 --> 35:03.330
jamie,we're going --

35:04.860 --> 35:06.400
I want to go.

35:06.540 --> 35:11.350
Jamie... quentin was my friend,and I want to say goodbye,too.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.100
It's gonna be really sad,buddy.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.110
I'm already sad.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.590
You're right.

35:31.100 --> 35:33.940
Quentin was your friend and a good one.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.100
You should say goodbye.

35:47.220 --> 35:49.250
The lord is my shepherd.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.190
I shall not want.

35:51.290 --> 35:55.050
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.270
He leadeth me beside still waters.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.570
He restoreth my soul.

36:00.690 --> 36:05.000
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake...

36:05.640 --> 36:10.710
* today   I heard *

36:12.160 --> 36:17.290
* that someone   left this earth *

36:18.620 --> 36:24.260
* that someone   disappeared *

36:24.630 --> 36:30.140
* left no one   here *

36:31.730 --> 36:40.630
* today   I heard   that someone *

36:41.210 --> 36:47.560
* just got up and left this earth *

36:47.730 --> 36:54.460
* lying on the ground *

36:57.780 --> 37:01.900
we're to celebrate the homegoing of young quentin fields.

37:05.430 --> 37:07.650
I'm sorry for your loss.

37:07.830 --> 37:10.130
Shut up.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.280
You lost a son.

37:14.150 --> 37:16.440
What was his name?

37:19.510 --> 37:22.700
you know you can't replace him with my grandson.

37:23.590 --> 37:28.070
Somewhere deep down inside...
you know he's not coming back.

37:30.350 --> 37:36.110
No matter what you do,your son is not coming back.

37:37.050 --> 37:42.800
* Disappeared   without noise *

37:42.940 --> 37:48.470
* and I wish   that I was there *

37:49.710 --> 37:53.960
* flying somewhere over there   .. *

37:54.200 --> 37:58.250
We celebrate the life of brother quentin...

37:58.640 --> 38:02.750
* tonight   in silence *

38:02.980 --> 38:09.150
* two lovers   they fight *

38:09.260 --> 38:12.230
* and one is bored *

38:12.380 --> 38:24.430
* one is angry   but neither one of them is right ohh *

38:24.620 --> 38:30.480
* today is   today is *

38:30.680 --> 38:40.940
* today is quiet in my town   today is   oh, *

38:41.080 --> 38:52.360
* today is   today is quiet in my town *

38:54.060 --> 38:56.680
quentin fields  was a basketball player.

38:58.610 --> 39:00.720
he was also a son...

39:07.860 --> 39:08.820
...a brother...

39:08.980 --> 39:14.340
*  the sound of birds *

39:14.690 --> 39:20.250
{\a6}* and I wish...  *

39:17.500 --> 39:20.260
somebody's teammate...

39:24.160 --> 39:26.200
...and somebody's friend.

39:27.810 --> 39:30.340
I never knew quentin fields.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.300
And I guess now I never will.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.900
Grief is like the ocean.

39:41.050 --> 39:44.630
It's deep and dark  and bigger than all of us.

39:45.030 --> 39:52.820
* it'too quiet   too quiet   it's too quiet *

39:52.890 --> 39:55.670
and pain is like a thief  in the night...

39:55.810 --> 40:03.750
* too quiet   it's too quiet   it's too quiet *

40:03.870 --> 40:08.520
...quiet,persistent,unfair...

40:08.890 --> 40:16.280
* oh,it's too quiet   it's too quiet *

40:16.400 --> 40:20.610
...diminished by time  and d h an love.

40:21.330 --> 40:33.190
* It's too quiet   it's too quiet   it's too   you,you *

40:33.310 --> 40:37.240
I didn't know quentin fields,but I'm jealous of him,

40:37.500 --> 40:42.270
because I see how his absence  has affected the people
who did know him,

40:42.380 --> 40:45.110
so I know  that he mattered to them.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.040
And I know he was loved.

40:48.410 --> 41:04.900
* it's so   I sing it out   today is   today is *

41:05.110 --> 41:24.870
* today is quiet in my town *

41:25.240 --> 41:29.420
people say quentin fields was a great basketball player --

41:29.730 --> 41:34.190
graceful,fluid,inspiring.

41:34.790 --> 41:38.660
They say,on a good night,it almost seemed  as though he could fly.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.000
and now he can.
