00:01.577 --> 00:04.252
[Dr. Jane Foster]
The Avengers are alive.

00:04.288 --> 00:06.980
I know for a fact that the Cabal
didn't disintegrate them.

00:07.015 --> 00:10.375
They just teleported them
away... far, far away.

00:14.732 --> 00:17.109
I discovered a way to back-trace the
missing Avengers through space-time.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.784
I can send you to them.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.361
These tethers
are your lifeline back.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.372
Find the Avengers, then activate
the tether to come home.

00:24.408 --> 00:26.875
Don't activate the tether until
you've found them. [Beeping]

00:26.910 --> 00:29.077
You'll only have
one shot at this.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.604
Good luck.

00:38.013 --> 00:40.489
Hmm. This is no forest
I am familiar with.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.384
That is not our moon.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.237
This is most likely not Earth.
[animal growling]

00:47.272 --> 00:48.455
[thud]

00:50.592 --> 00:52.551
[growling continues]

00:52.586 --> 00:54.669
Definitely not Earth.

[thunderous roaring]

01:41.427 --> 01:43.635
[whimpering]

01:45.555 --> 01:47.172
Hulk, I am glad I found you.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.623
[growls]

01:48.659 --> 01:51.560
Hulk saved Cat-man.

01:51.595 --> 01:55.338
Hulk, it is me, Black Panther,
and I have come to help you.

01:55.373 --> 01:57.082
What is that on your wrist?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.102
[growling]

02:00.137 --> 02:01.686
Hulk, where are you going?

02:01.721 --> 02:04.255
[sighs]

02:04.291 --> 02:07.008
Should've known
this would not be easy.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.327
[Hulk grunting]
[blows landing on trees]

[growling]

02:16.587 --> 02:18.044
Hulk, stop!

02:21.400 --> 02:22.732
[laughing]

02:22.767 --> 02:24.968
[grunting]

02:26.596 --> 02:30.432
Hulk tired of running.

02:30.467 --> 02:33.009
You do not have to run
any longer, Hulk.

02:33.045 --> 02:35.187
I have a way out of here.
A way back home.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.658
Mm? Too late, Cat-man.
He's here.

02:40.694 --> 02:41.944
Who is here?

02:41.979 --> 02:44.196
[grunts, laughs]

02:46.325 --> 02:49.242
[both grunt]

02:50.645 --> 02:52.246
Who...

02:52.281 --> 02:55.048
"Who," mortal?

02:55.125 --> 02:59.277
Why, the hunter supreme
of this realm... Skurge!

02:59.313 --> 03:01.496
Apologies, Skurge.

03:01.531 --> 03:03.431
There will be no hunt today.

03:03.466 --> 03:05.091
We were just leaving.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.722
The tether home!

03:12.317 --> 03:14.760
[growling]

03:14.795 --> 03:17.545
No, you'll not escape so easily.

03:17.581 --> 03:19.231
Hulk smash Skurge!

03:20.951 --> 03:24.777
[Black Panther, Skurge grunt]

03:24.813 --> 03:27.047
[Skurge yells] [grunts]

03:27.082 --> 03:29.074
[laughs] [roaring]

03:31.929 --> 03:33.453
Kasta snubba viekr!

03:35.032 --> 03:37.223
No! [Grunts]

03:37.259 --> 03:38.925
[body thuds] Bruce Banner?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.036
[panting] [Skurge]
Thanks to the magic

03:41.071 --> 03:43.129
[growls]
of my beloved Enchantress,

03:43.164 --> 03:47.642
you'll smash nothing
I do not allow, monster.

03:47.677 --> 03:52.013
In this realm,
I am the master of the Hulk.

03:52.048 --> 03:55.708
You and your new ally
are no match for...

03:55.744 --> 03:57.527
Is that so, villain?

03:57.563 --> 04:02.574
Surrender, or your mortal friend
won't see another day in Asgard.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.443
[screaming]

04:07.297 --> 04:09.014
[grunts]

04:09.049 --> 04:12.584
There is no finer realm
for a hunt.

04:12.620 --> 04:17.079
I knew another Avenger would come
for this Hulk and join my sport.

04:17.116 --> 04:20.065
In our last hunt, Black Panther,

04:20.101 --> 04:23.837
you bested me only with
the help of your allies.

04:23.872 --> 04:27.774
This time they are not
here to save you.

04:27.810 --> 04:31.428
Let us hope you provide
a bit of entertainment.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.790
I will give you
the hunt of your life,

04:35.825 --> 04:37.926
if you let Bruce Banner go.

04:37.961 --> 04:40.203
It would be rude
to leave him out.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.847
But I have a remedy.

04:42.883 --> 04:46.759
To replace the band I destroyed
of yours, outlander,

04:46.795 --> 04:48.928
a new one.

04:48.964 --> 04:50.071
Snubba praell knutr!

04:51.483 --> 04:53.074
Huh?

04:53.110 --> 04:55.660
Now I will hunt you both.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.070
Two quarries,
for twice the sport.

04:58.106 --> 05:01.115
But I am not without
a measure of fairness.

05:01.151 --> 05:04.703
I will give you a lead,
to the count of the nine realms.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.455
Run! Jotunheim,

05:07.490 --> 05:10.225
Asgard, Alfheim,

05:10.260 --> 05:12.977
Muspelheim, Nidvellir,

05:13.012 --> 05:15.939
Vanaheim, Svartlheim,

05:15.974 --> 05:19.784
Nifleheim, and Midgard.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.679
[laughing]

05:22.714 --> 05:26.716
Watch out for the poison thorns.
I think they're lethal. [Grunts]

05:26.751 --> 05:29.611
We would have an easier time
over open ground.

05:29.646 --> 05:31.240
Then Skurge will get us.
He'll hunt us from above.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.222
Hide!

05:33.258 --> 05:36.284
[growling]

05:38.771 --> 05:40.372
[grunts]

05:43.159 --> 05:45.410
Skurge somehow changed you
from the Hulk to human.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.413
How was he able to do that?

05:48.448 --> 05:51.040
I don't know. Just when Bruce
Banner is about to keel over,

05:51.075 --> 05:54.844
he uses that magic stone in his
ax to turn me back into the Hulk.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.922
And if Hulk gets close
to smashing him...

05:56.957 --> 05:58.982
Well, you saw what happens.

05:59.017 --> 06:02.785
I can't control the change.
I'm... I'm... I'm helpless.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.871
You are Bruce Banner,
so I doubt that.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.416
But I will find us a way out.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.651
Without my tether, however,
I am not quite sure how yet.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.890
[sniffing] They're close.

06:15.926 --> 06:18.885
I can smell them.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.287
Kanu skia berserk'r!

06:25.802 --> 06:28.242
I know how to get us home, Panther.
We just have to... Oh, no.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.981
[growling]

06:32.016 --> 06:34.400
[roaring]

06:34.436 --> 06:37.696
[grunts] Why is Hulk
chained to puny Cat-man?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.714
Hulk, wait.

06:39.749 --> 06:42.533
[yelling] [cries out]

06:42.569 --> 06:45.378
[yells] Hulk make Skurge pay!

06:45.413 --> 06:48.715
Hulk, stop! Banner...
He had a plan to get us...

06:48.750 --> 06:51.100
Bah! Hulk would smash
puny Banner!

06:51.135 --> 06:53.136
[roars]

06:53.171 --> 06:55.814
[grunting]
So much for conversation.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.608
[grunts] [grunts]

06:58.643 --> 07:00.977
Hulk, you must calm down.

07:01.012 --> 07:03.504
Cat-man try to stop Hulk too?

07:03.539 --> 07:06.557
Hulk smash you, Cat-man!

07:06.593 --> 07:08.568
I am not against you, Hulk.
[grunts] [grunts]

07:08.604 --> 07:10.294
[grunts] [thuds]

07:10.330 --> 07:13.348
[grunts] Sleep, Cat-man.

07:13.383 --> 07:15.842
Hulk find Skurge and smash him.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.713
Out in the open?
Not very smart, Hulk.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.358
But then again,
you're not very smart.

07:31.393 --> 07:33.351
[gru, roars]

07:33.386 --> 07:34.444
[grunts]

07:35.981 --> 07:37.897
[grunts, yells]

07:37.932 --> 07:39.849
[yells]

07:39.885 --> 07:41.910
[roars] [grunts]

07:41.945 --> 07:44.621
[both grunting]

07:46.642 --> 07:49.742
[Skurge laughing]

07:49.777 --> 07:52.587
[Hulk straining]

07:55.609 --> 07:58.075
Kasta snubba viekr!

07:58.111 --> 08:00.745
[laughing]

08:00.781 --> 08:01.905
[groans]

08:01.940 --> 08:03.272
[yelling]

08:03.308 --> 08:05.541
Black Panther!

08:05.577 --> 08:07.293
Panther, wake up!

08:07.329 --> 08:09.646
We're in trouble!

08:11.583 --> 08:12.607
Hold on!

08:14.452 --> 08:17.912
[both grunt, groan]

08:17.948 --> 08:20.465
[both grunt]

08:20.500 --> 08:22.591
Bruce, are you hurt?

08:22.627 --> 08:23.867
[groans, mutters affirmatively]

08:24.830 --> 08:26.462
[both yell]

08:26.497 --> 08:27.780
[thud] [both grunt]

08:27.815 --> 08:29.941
[groans]

08:29.976 --> 08:31.676
Don't look like Asgardians.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.712
What are they?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.722
I don't know.

08:35.756 --> 08:39.017
They look puny,
but they do look soft

08:39.052 --> 08:41.970
and plenty fine to eat.

08:44.115 --> 08:45.815
[crackling sound]
[grunts softly]

08:45.850 --> 08:48.510
Bruce, where are you?

08:48.545 --> 08:50.019
In the same trouble as you.

08:53.650 --> 08:56.001
I think we should've peeled
the skin off the cat.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.210
For a quicker roast.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.172
No. We bake him in that skin.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.259
Seal in the juices real rich.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.812
I would rather we did not
cook the cat at all.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.139
Quiet! You don't get a say.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.857
More wood for the fire, Ulik!

09:11.893 --> 09:13.042
[grunts]

09:18.733 --> 09:22.276
Banner, I can cut us free
if you can distract the big one.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.487
How am I supposed to do that?

09:24.523 --> 09:26.531
Bruce Banner is supposed
to be a genius.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.890
Think of something.

09:29.493 --> 09:32.195
Hey, troll, you were right.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.022
I was right about what?

09:34.057 --> 09:35.656
You were right.

09:35.691 --> 09:37.191
The cat needs peeling.

09:40.655 --> 09:44.098
I knew it!
The cat needs peeling!

09:44.134 --> 09:45.474
Thank you, Banner.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.301
[grunts]

09:47.337 --> 09:48.694
What are you doing? [Grunts]

09:48.729 --> 09:50.779
[groans]

09:50.815 --> 09:53.307
You don't listen to the food,
you eat it.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.285
This food is smarter than you.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.162
[both grunt] [thudding]

09:58.198 --> 10:01.332
[Ulik] I'll tenderize
you with my pounders!

10:01.368 --> 10:03.209
You hit like you cook!
[Ulik] Oh, yeah?

10:03.244 --> 10:05.044
Yeah! [Grunts]

10:05.079 --> 10:06.638
[grunts]

10:08.100 --> 10:10.483
[blow lands]

10:10.519 --> 10:12.234
[blow lands]

10:12.270 --> 10:14.103
[blow lands]

10:14.139 --> 10:16.288
Ulik's weapon may prove useful.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.057
[groans] Hungry? Eat this!

10:18.092 --> 10:20.401
[yells]

10:24.241 --> 10:25.907
[both yell]

10:27.785 --> 10:30.078
Fine. Then we skin it.

10:31.415 --> 10:33.047
Our dinner!

10:33.083 --> 10:34.933
[both growl]

10:34.968 --> 10:37.210
[panting]

10:41.107 --> 10:43.574
[grunts]

10:43.610 --> 10:46.318
[breathing heavily]

10:46.354 --> 10:48.262
They're close. I heard 'em.

10:52.060 --> 10:54.143
[brush rustles] Over that way!

10:55.446 --> 10:57.171
[panting]

10:57.207 --> 10:59.373
[sighs]

10:59.409 --> 11:02.092
We are not going to last long
chained together.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.589
What do you have in mind? No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

11:03.613 --> 11:05.271
Aaahhh! Aah! [Grunts]

11:05.306 --> 11:08.607
I've tried that.

11:08.643 --> 11:11.052
With anything hard
I could get my hands on.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.463
Only Skurge can break
the enchantment with his ax.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.816
Then let us focus
on getting out of here.

11:16.851 --> 11:19.502
Before you turned into Hulk,
you told me you had a way out.

11:22.323 --> 11:24.715
There.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.376
Beyond those mountains
is the city of Asgard.

11:27.412 --> 11:30.288
The home of Thor.
And his friend, Heimdall,

11:30.323 --> 11:32.715
who has the means
to get us home.

11:32.751 --> 11:35.743
Problem is, Skurge
won't let me get close.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.046
I've been trying for weeks.

11:38.081 --> 11:41.190
Well, we did just escape
a pair of hungry trolls.

11:41.225 --> 11:43.518
We have a better shot together.
Take this.

11:43.553 --> 11:45.987
[grunts, strains]

11:56.466 --> 11:58.925
This does not seem so bad.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.135
Well, we haven't seen
any goblins yet.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.836
[grunts] [growling]

12:02.872 --> 12:04.780
[straining] [grunts]

12:04.816 --> 12:06.674
[hissing]

12:09.187 --> 12:11.371
What do the goblins want?

12:11.406 --> 12:14.139
To eat us, like everything else
in this forsaken place.

12:14.175 --> 12:15.666
We better run. [Hissing]

12:15.702 --> 12:16.702
[grunts]

12:20.539 --> 12:21.619
[goblins growling, hissing]

12:25.302 --> 12:26.461
[yells]

12:26.496 --> 12:28.613
[grunting]

12:32.343 --> 12:33.851
[groans]

12:33.887 --> 12:35.677
[growls, cries out]

12:35.713 --> 12:38.105
[goblins hissing, growling]

12:38.141 --> 12:40.483
I'm no help to you.

12:40.518 --> 12:42.526
You are only as useful
as you think you are.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.996
[hissing, growling continue]

12:45.031 --> 12:46.798
I've got an idea. Hold them off!

12:50.937 --> 12:53.930
[grunting]

12:55.200 --> 12:56.933
[grunts]

12:58.919 --> 12:59.919
Yeah!

13:01.748 --> 13:03.889
[laughing] Yes!

13:03.925 --> 13:07.860
Oh, they would be foolish enough
to brave the goblins.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.239
[hissing]

13:12.275 --> 13:14.150
[grunts] [body thuds]

13:14.185 --> 13:15.185
[grunts]

13:19.349 --> 13:21.958
[grunting]

13:33.296 --> 13:34.846
[yells, grunts]

13:36.449 --> 13:39.283
[goblins hissing, growling]

13:39.318 --> 13:40.560
[rumbling]

13:43.156 --> 13:45.889
It worked!

13:45.925 --> 13:48.359
[Black Panther]
It worked, all right. Go!

13:57.753 --> 14:01.030
[panting]

14:01.065 --> 14:03.866
And you wondered
if you were useful.

14:03.902 --> 14:06.693
Well, I've been told
I'm good at smashing.

14:06.729 --> 14:07.729
[yells]

14:13.937 --> 14:16.278
Never made it this far before.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.497
We should make
the gates by morning.

14:18.533 --> 14:20.575
[creaking] Whoa.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.426
[creaking continues]

14:22.461 --> 14:25.029
Whoa. Whoa! Ugh.

14:25.106 --> 14:27.706
I thought all their bridges
were made of rainbows.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.658
Keep moving. We are doing well.

14:29.693 --> 14:31.752
Too well. [Laughs]

14:31.787 --> 14:33.463
Too well.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.789
Kanu skia berserk'r!

14:35.825 --> 14:36.991
[cries out]

14:39.796 --> 14:41.954
[groaning] Oh, no.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.307
[both yell]

14:44.342 --> 14:46.918
[grunting]

14:52.658 --> 14:56.043
[yells] Hulk hate falling!

14:56.078 --> 14:58.471
Where are they?

14:58.506 --> 14:59.931
Hmm? [Growls]

15:02.218 --> 15:03.218
Hmm?

15:09.049 --> 15:10.232
[growls]

15:12.386 --> 15:14.403
[yells]

15:20.453 --> 15:23.504
[both breathing heavily]

15:23.540 --> 15:25.239
[both sigh]

15:25.274 --> 15:27.550
[laughs]

15:27.585 --> 15:30.519
Cat-man fooled bald man.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.797
Cat-man is smart. [Laughing]

15:35.276 --> 15:36.843
[laughs]

15:36.878 --> 15:38.619
Black Panther.

15:38.654 --> 15:40.579
You can call me Black Panther.

15:40.615 --> 15:43.290
[growls]

15:43.325 --> 15:46.102
Hulk calls Cat-man "Cat-man."

15:47.897 --> 15:50.306
Fine. Call me whatever you want.

15:50.341 --> 15:52.808
Do you trust me now? Mm.

15:52.843 --> 15:55.395
Hulk will listen to Cat-man.

15:55.430 --> 15:58.047
[groans]
Then let us get out of here.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.615
We are going that way.

16:01.343 --> 16:04.162
[grunts] Hang on, Cat-man.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.955
[Hulk grunts]

16:08.476 --> 16:10.293
[grunts]

16:10.328 --> 16:12.469
[wind howling]

16:12.505 --> 16:15.431
Uhh.

16:15.466 --> 16:16.966
Hulk go the right way?

16:20.997 --> 16:24.031
Yes. We are almost there.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.475
You're not going anywhere,
except to your doom!

16:27.896 --> 16:29.562
[both grunt]

16:29.597 --> 16:31.439
[both yelling]

16:37.146 --> 16:38.871
[Hulk yells] Hold on!

16:38.907 --> 16:40.990
[both grunt]

16:42.860 --> 16:45.428
[grunts, growls]

16:45.463 --> 16:48.981
[grunting]

16:49.016 --> 16:52.435
[laughs] You Avengers have
made this quite a challenge.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.437
But no more hunting,

16:54.472 --> 16:56.163
and no more running.

16:56.198 --> 16:57.748
[grunts]

16:57.783 --> 16:58.883
[thud]

16:58.918 --> 17:01.552
No more mercy.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.122
[grunts] Smash!

17:05.157 --> 17:06.891
[roaring]

17:09.444 --> 17:11.311
Kasta snubba viekr!

17:11.347 --> 17:14.365
No! [Grunts]

17:14.400 --> 17:17.385
I've seen the Hulk rage,

17:17.420 --> 17:21.289
but I have yet to see
you lose control, Cat-man.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.601
Let us see how you fight
when consumed with the fury!

17:25.637 --> 17:27.661
Kanu skia berserk'r!

17:28.873 --> 17:30.439
No!

17:30.475 --> 17:32.850
[grunts]

17:32.885 --> 17:36.403
[growling]

17:36.439 --> 17:39.565
[roars] [grunts]

17:39.600 --> 17:41.717
[snarling]

17:43.888 --> 17:47.372
Panther, you've got
to control the rage!

17:47.408 --> 17:48.716
[snarls]

17:48.751 --> 17:51.235
Curious.

17:51.312 --> 17:54.171
How Black Panther was able
to help the monster in you

17:54.206 --> 17:56.599
to overcome my curse
of the beserker.

17:56.634 --> 18:00.186
Your magic only works on those who
don't know they can fight it, Skurge.

18:00.221 --> 18:02.145
I know that now.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.307
Ah, you've learned too late, mortal.
[gasps]

18:05.343 --> 18:06.308
[snarls]

18:06.344 --> 18:07.376
[grunts]

18:07.412 --> 18:08.711
Come, then,

18:08.746 --> 18:10.713
meet your doom, beast!

18:10.748 --> 18:13.207
[snarling] [grunting]

18:15.853 --> 18:16.785
[grunts]

18:16.820 --> 18:18.111
[grunts]

18:18.147 --> 18:19.813
[snarls]

18:19.849 --> 18:22.058
Come on, Panther. Stay down.

18:22.093 --> 18:24.335
[snarling] You're beaten.
We're beaten.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.938
Panther... not... beaten!

18:27.973 --> 18:30.683
Oh, yes, you are. [Laughing]

18:32.904 --> 18:36.013
You have found
your courage, mortal.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.091
But this day
will be long remembered

18:39.126 --> 18:43.128
as the one Skurge finished
two of Earth's mightiest heroes

18:43.164 --> 18:46.023
with a single strike! No!

18:46.058 --> 18:48.200
[grunts]

18:51.146 --> 18:52.763
[grunts]

18:52.799 --> 18:55.208
The spell... is it broken?

18:55.243 --> 18:58.211
Let's find out.

18:58.246 --> 19:00.871
[growls, roars]

19:00.906 --> 19:03.174
Skurge!

19:06.988 --> 19:09.121
[panting] [yells]

19:09.157 --> 19:10.564
[grunts]

19:10.600 --> 19:12.383
Kasta snubb...

19:12.418 --> 19:13.418
[roars]

19:15.204 --> 19:17.438
To me, my wolf! [Grunts]

19:19.325 --> 19:20.482
[growling]

19:22.219 --> 19:23.219
[yells]

19:24.705 --> 19:25.738
[whimpers]

19:25.773 --> 19:27.907
[grunts, yells]

19:31.529 --> 19:32.720
Ah... [yells]

19:32.755 --> 19:35.263
[screaming]

19:35.299 --> 19:39.084
Hulk smash you now! [Growling]

19:39.119 --> 19:41.253
Wait! I have a better idea.
[grunts]

19:42.648 --> 19:43.648
[groaning]

19:46.335 --> 19:51.096
[grunts] [screaming]

19:51.132 --> 19:53.498
Hungry. Next meal we eat raw.

19:53.534 --> 19:54.575
[grunts]

19:54.610 --> 19:57.645
[growling]

19:57.680 --> 20:00.798
Blasted mortals!

20:00.833 --> 20:03.350
[Ulik] Skurge! [Gasps]

20:03.386 --> 20:07.513
Your hunt has taken you
awfully far from home.

20:07.548 --> 20:09.540
Why don't you stay for dinner?

20:09.575 --> 20:11.509
We'd love to have you.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.676
[laughing] Uhh...

20:12.711 --> 20:15.671
[grunting]

20:15.706 --> 20:17.689
Come back, brave hunter!

20:17.725 --> 20:19.458
[laughing]

20:22.972 --> 20:26.348
I have been watching.
You have done well, mortals.

20:26.383 --> 20:29.543
Heimdall knows the Hulk.

20:29.578 --> 20:32.563
I know you, Hulk, but I do not
know the stranger with you.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.157
Black Panther.

20:35.193 --> 20:38.652
His name's Black Panther,
and he helped the Hulk.

20:38.688 --> 20:42.297
Hulk was bewitched here by Enchantress
and Skurge. I came to his aid.

20:42.332 --> 20:45.217
I suspected something amiss.

20:45.252 --> 20:47.645
I have scoured the realms
for the Son of Odin,

20:47.680 --> 20:49.947
but he is beyond my sight.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.507
We are working
to bring Thor back as well.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.785
We will send word
when we find him.

20:54.820 --> 20:58.297
Then you have my gratitude,
Black Panther.

20:58.332 --> 21:00.332
I will return you
to the realm of Midgard.

21:13.013 --> 21:17.140
You came to save me, the Hulk.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.109
You barely even know me.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.804
I know you are a hero.

21:21.839 --> 21:24.707
Besides, we are Avengers.

21:24.742 --> 21:32.742
This is what we do.
