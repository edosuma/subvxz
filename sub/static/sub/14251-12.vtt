WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.399
Thank you.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.938
Oh, you look like a man
who could use more coffee.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.736
Keep it coming.

00:08.808 --> 00:11.276
l'm working
on my monthly ops report.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.642
So much has happened in the
last few weeks on this ship,

00:13.713 --> 00:15.237
l'm going to be up all night.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.806
This firenut blend
should keep your eyes open.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.415
Potent stuff.
Thanks.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.480
- Neelix.
- Yes.

00:24.557 --> 00:25.990
l know you have your
hands full this evening,

00:26.092 --> 00:26.990
but l could use your help.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.492
At your service, Commander.

00:28.561 --> 00:29.994
We're approaching
a class- 1 nebula.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.497
Sensors are picking up traces
of protomatter inside.

00:32.564 --> 00:33.691
l understand you've
dealt with it before.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.292
Absolutely, when l was
making my living as a trader.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.394
Protomatter's one of the most
sought- after commodities.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.098
lt's the best energy source
in the Quadrant.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.140
Well, we could use

00:41.207 --> 00:42.697
your expertise
in collecting a sample.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.743
We're leaving at 1400.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.038
See you in the shuttle bay?

00:45.111 --> 00:47.011
l'll be there, sir.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.015
These nutritional supplements
are unacceptable.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.178
What's wrong?

00:54.254 --> 00:56.017
They are pungent.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.250
That's the whole idea.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.554
l've been adding
Talaxian spices

01:00.627 --> 01:02.151
to broaden your palate.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.525
My palate is sufficiently broad.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.690
Why settle for"sufficient"?

01:06.766 --> 01:07.790
The Doctor tells me

01:07.867 --> 01:09.630
you have a full complement
of taste buds.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.101
You've hardly begun
to use them.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.537
Come by the Mess Hall
Thursday night.

01:13.606 --> 01:14.971
lt's the first day of Prixin.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.441
We'll have an impressive array
of exotic cuisine.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.534
Prixin?

01:18.611 --> 01:20.636
The Talaxian celebration
of family.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.408
We observe it every year
on Voyager.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.915
Now that you're
part of the family...

01:23.983 --> 01:25.974
What should l do to prepare?

01:26.052 --> 01:27.178
Nothing.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.880
lt's not a mission, Seven.

01:28.955 --> 01:30.217
lt's a party!

01:30.290 --> 01:32.758
Ensign Wildman to Neelix.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.293
Uh, Neelix here.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.327
l hate to bother you,

01:35.395 --> 01:37.386
but Naomi's having trouble
getting to sleep again.

01:37.464 --> 01:38.522
Would you mind?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.589
No bother at all.
l'm on my way.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.795
lf you'll excuse me,
duty calls.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.168
"Naomi"-- l don't recall
that designation

01:46.239 --> 01:47.501
on the crew manifest.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.542
That's because she's not
a member of the crew.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.839
Naomi was the first child
born on Voyager.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.344
l'm her godfather

01:53.413 --> 01:55.847
and the only one that can
get her to sleep lately.

01:55.915 --> 01:56.882
Bon appetit.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.454
No monsters here.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.491
Good.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.717
Check the replicator.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.792
Ah.

02:13.867 --> 02:14.799
Nothing.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.268
Naomi, maybe Neelix
should check your room

02:17.337 --> 02:18.497
so you can go to bed.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.368
Okay.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.964
ln there.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.945
Nobody here.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.006
There.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.889
Ah, there's not
a monster in sight.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.619
Can you stay longer?

02:40.693 --> 02:42.718
l'm afraid to go to sleep.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.422
Honey, Neelix has to go to work.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.124
Oh, it's all right.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.326
You know what l think about
when l'm afraid to go to sleep?

02:48.401 --> 02:50.335
No. What?

02:50.403 --> 02:53.702
The Great Forest.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.297
What's that?

02:55.375 --> 02:57.036
lt's a place my people believe

02:57.110 --> 02:58.873
we're all going to go to
someday.

02:58.945 --> 03:02.881
lt's a beautiful, beautiful
forest filled with sunlight

03:02.949 --> 03:05.611
and all the people who ever
loved me are gathered there

03:05.685 --> 03:08.415
to watch over me as l sleep,
to protect me.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.887
Really?

03:09.956 --> 03:13.392
Mm- hmm, and when l think about
that forest and those people,

03:13.459 --> 03:15.586
l'm not afraid to sleep anymore.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.927
Do you think those people
watch over me, too?

03:18.998 --> 03:20.932
l know they do.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.936
Now, l'm going to be away
for the next couple of days,

03:25.004 --> 03:27.495
so if you're afraid to sleep,

03:27.574 --> 03:29.940
l want you to think
of that Great Forest.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.101
All right.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.644
Pleasant dreams.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.974
Night, Neelix.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.071
Thank you.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.190 --> 03:45.714
Cylinder...

03:50.430 --> 03:51.397
Oh!

03:51.464 --> 03:52.829
Sorry.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.993
l didn't realize you were home.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.036
l was regenerating.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.570
l see.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.833
Do you require assistance?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.636
No, no, no, l have a small

04:02.709 --> 04:04.836
containment cylinder
stored here.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.845
l'll just be a minute.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.540
Cylinder...

04:08.615 --> 04:11.675
Little cylinder, where are you?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.810
Cylinder, you were here
a month ago.

04:13.886 --> 04:15.717
Now, l know you
didn't just roll

04:15.788 --> 04:17.653
out of the airlock
all by yourself.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.022
Now, where are you?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.651
Oh...

04:21.728 --> 04:23.423
l'm sorry.

04:23.496 --> 04:24.428
l'm talking to myself.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.691
lt's my way
of remembering things.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.892
You are a peculiar creature,
Neelix.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.127
Thanks.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.102
l think.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.467
Ah! Here it is.

04:32.538 --> 04:35.234
Oh, this will be perfect

04:35.308 --> 04:37.401
for containing
a small amount of protomatter.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.412
Last time l used
this little wonder,

04:40.480 --> 04:41.913
l nearly lost it to the Kazon.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.745
The Kazon-- Species 329.

04:44.817 --> 04:46.148
You're familiar with them.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.550
The Borg encountered
a Kazon colony

04:47.620 --> 04:48.917
in the Gand sector.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.888
Grid 6920.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.448
Were they assimilated?

04:53.526 --> 04:55.426
Their biological and
technological distinctiveness

04:55.495 --> 04:56.757
was unremarkable.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.524
They were unworthy
of assimilation.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.032
l didn't realize the Borg
were so discriminating.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.362
Why assimilate a species

05:02.435 --> 05:04.335
that would detract
from perfection?

05:05.538 --> 05:07.005
Good point.

05:07.073 --> 05:12.636
Well, um, if you'll excuse me,
l'm needed in the shuttle bay.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.236
Pleasant...

05:14.314 --> 05:15.747
regenerating.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.087
One day a week--
that's all l ask.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.421
How hard can it be?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.425
Harder than you think.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.428
Neelix, it's pizza!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.691
Bread, tomatoes, cheese.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.528
The cheese alone
would take days.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.330
Separating curds and whey
from synthesized milk--

05:37.403 --> 05:38.392
it's a delicate process.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.938
So replicate the cheese!

05:40.006 --> 05:43.737
Since it means so much to you,
l'll see what l can do.

05:43.810 --> 05:44.742
Thanks.

05:46.412 --> 05:49.904
There's a concentration
of protomatter directly ahead.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.347
Neelix?

05:51.417 --> 05:53.612
Set the transporter
for 10, 000 AMUs.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.085
Not a particle more.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.384
The containment field
is standing by.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.084
We're in range.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.386
Energizing.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.060
What happened?

06:09.135 --> 06:11.865
The transporter beam
ignited the protomatter.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.303
Shields are weakening.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.501
Disengage transport.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.167
Shields are down!

06:19.245 --> 06:21.236
l've got the sample, Commander,
and it's stable.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.440
Let's get out of...

06:30.990 --> 06:32.685
We're clear of the protomatter.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.249
How's Neelix?

06:38.531 --> 06:40.624
He's dead.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.808
No heartbeat.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.905
No synaptic response.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.813
Extensive cell damage
to his brain.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.352
Try a cortical stimulator.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.312
lt won't work.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.913
His neural pathways were
disrupted by the protomatter.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.221
Set the stimulator
for an autonomic bypass.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.692
At least, we can get
his vitals going.

08:48.761 --> 08:49.853
lt's too late for that.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.191
The damage was too severe.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.630
We're running
into more protomatter.

08:57.670 --> 08:58.659
l need your help.

09:09.015 --> 09:13.213
Captain's Log, Stardate 51449. 2.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.221
After receiving a distress call
from Commander Chakotay,

09:16.289 --> 09:17.847
we've sent a beacon
into the nebula

09:17.957 --> 09:21.415
and we're in the process
of tracking down the away team.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.553
Captain, l'm detecting
a shuttle.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.096
Hail them.

09:25.164 --> 09:26.597
No response.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.657
The shuttle's primary
systems are off- line.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.861
Life signs, only two.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.402
Are they
within transporter range?

09:32.471 --> 09:33.403
Affirmative.

09:33.472 --> 09:34.461
Beam them directly to Sick Bay.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.905
Harry, put a tractor
on the shuttlecraft.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.408
Tuvok, you've got the Bridge.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.912
l ran a complete
postmortem analysis.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.917
There was nothing
you could have done.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.681
l knew we were too close
to the protomatter.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.085
l should have said something.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.488
Nobody could have
predicted this, Tom.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.185
How shall l...

09:54.260 --> 09:55.818
proceed?

09:56.929 --> 10:00.626
The Talaxians mourn their
dead for a full week

10:00.700 --> 10:03.328
in a specific burial ceremony.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.938
And that's just what
we're going to do.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.531
l'll inform the crew.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.075
l'll check Neelix's
personal data base--

10:14.146 --> 10:16.444
see what l can find out
about the ceremony.

10:16.515 --> 10:19.075
We'll have it in the Mess Hall.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.176
Somehow that feels
appropriate.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.118
Neelix is dead.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.656
l'm afraid so.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.318
His neural pathways--
are they intact?

10:27.393 --> 10:30.123
Yes, but there's
no metabolic activity.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.185
How long has he been dead?

10:31.263 --> 10:32.195
Seven, l understand...

10:32.264 --> 10:33.196
How long?

10:33.265 --> 10:34.254
lt's been 18 hours.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.631
Then it's not too late
to reactivate him.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.669
What are you saying--

10:37.737 --> 10:39.602
that you can bring
Neelix back to life?

10:39.672 --> 10:41.139
That's precisely
what l'm saying.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.766
The Borg have
assimilated species

10:43.843 --> 10:46.038
with far greater medical
knowledge than your own.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.046
We are capable of
reactivating drones

10:48.114 --> 10:50.981
as much as 73 hours after
what you would call"death."

10:51.050 --> 10:52.847
Neelix wasn't a Borg drone.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.317
We will adapt.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.355
What does this"procedure"
involve?

10:56.422 --> 10:59.448
Nanoprobes are used
to reverse cellular necrosis,

10:59.525 --> 11:01.356
while the cerebral cortex
is stimulated

11:01.460 --> 11:03.087
with a neuroelectric
iso- pulse.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.562
But there's nothing
left to stimulate.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.722
His brain functions are gone.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.892
By your narrow definition
perhaps, but not by mine.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.766
You will extract 70 micrograms
of nanoprobes

11:11.837 --> 11:12.861
from my bloodstream.

11:12.938 --> 11:13.905
l will modify them

11:13.973 --> 11:16.464
to match
his Talaxian physiology.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.511
His function in this crew
is diverse.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.979
lf you wish to salvage him,
we must proceed immediately.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.482
l say we let her try.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.643
Hold on a minute, Tom, please.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.952
No one's ever been resuscitated
after being dead for 18 hours.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.823
lf this procedure does work,

11:35.895 --> 11:39.729
what are the chances that Neelix
would come out of it unaffected?

11:39.799 --> 11:40.823
She's right.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.925
The damage to his cerebral
cortex was severe.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.369
The nanoprobes will compensate
for any cellular degradation.

11:46.439 --> 11:50.341
Captain, a decision
has to be made quickly.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.836
Doctor, give Seven
whatever assistance she needs.

11:53.913 --> 11:54.845
Proceed.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.245
- Captain...
- Do it.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.374
lf there's a chance
we can revive Neelix,

11:58.451 --> 11:59.543
we've got to take it.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.214
Keep me informed.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.825
The nanoprobes are ready.
We should begin.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.025
Hold on, l want to check
his blood viscosity.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.092
The cadaver has been
sufficiently prepared.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.660
And they say l have
a lousy bedside manner.

12:23.209 --> 12:26.667
Set neuroelectric iso- pulses
for one- second intervals.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.643
Ready.

12:33.719 --> 12:34.686
Now.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.848
Neural activity
at nine percent...

12:40.926 --> 12:42.393
10 percent...

12:42.461 --> 12:43.450
12 percent.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.121
This is incredible!

12:45.197 --> 12:46.596
His intracerebral
blood pressure,

12:46.665 --> 12:47.654
his synaptic responses--

12:47.733 --> 12:48.995
they're all returning
to normal.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.798
The alveoli in his lung
are regenerating.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.271
They should be functional...

12:55.307 --> 12:56.274
now.

12:58.377 --> 13:01.039
Neural activity at 52
percent and rising.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.718
His neurotransmitter levels
are rising too fast.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.255
We must stabilize
his motor neurons.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.381
l'm going to try reducing
his acetylcholine levels.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.390
lt might be enough to...

13:13.459 --> 13:15.518
Doctor...

13:16.929 --> 13:19.295
Neelix.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.923
What...happened?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.399
What happened?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.901
Why am...

13:23.969 --> 13:25.402
why am l here?

13:38.784 --> 13:39.808
Dead.

13:39.885 --> 13:43.753
For 18 hours
49 minutes, 13 seconds.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.415
Congratulations, Mr. Neelix.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.391
You've just set
a new world record.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.360
That's impossible.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.160
You mean, l lost consciousness.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.632
l- l was, l was in a coma.

13:55.701 --> 13:56.827
No.

13:56.902 --> 13:57.960
You were dead.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.402
l'm stunned.
l'm amazed.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.640
l- l'm grateful.
Thank you, Doctor.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.579
Actually, you can
thank Seven of Nine.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.549
The procedure was her idea.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.915
Yours?

14:13.986 --> 14:16.853
The Borg assimilated the
technique from Species 149.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.048
l simply modified it.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.956
But you are welcome.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.458
Am l good as new?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.022
That remains to be seen.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.624
There's no way to tell
if your body

14:29.702 --> 14:31.363
will successfully
take over the functions

14:31.437 --> 14:32.904
the nanoprobes are serving.

14:32.972 --> 14:33.939
Nanoprobes?

14:34.039 --> 14:37.440
lt was necessary to repair
the necrotized tissue.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.170
Until l'm certain
the damaged tissue

14:39.245 --> 14:41.839
can function independently,
you'll have to be injected

14:41.914 --> 14:43.506
with nanoprobes
on a daily basis.

14:43.582 --> 14:48.144
Well, as long as l don't start,
uh, assimilating the crew

14:48.220 --> 14:49.710
or sprouting Borg implants...

14:49.788 --> 14:51.756
l'm sure l can live with it.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.451
l'm releasing you
to your quarters.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.220
Your body's
been through quite a shock

14:55.294 --> 14:56.352
so try to get some rest.

14:56.428 --> 14:57.827
Report to Sick Bay
tomorrow morning

14:57.897 --> 14:59.956
at 0800 hours
for your next injection.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.071
The shuttle mission--
was it a success?

15:11.143 --> 15:12.337
Did we get the protomatter?

15:12.411 --> 15:13.343
l'm afraid not.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.380
The sample you
collected destabilized

15:15.447 --> 15:17.039
before it got back to Voyager.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.415
The containment field needs
to be reinforced next time.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.612
lf there is a next time.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.484
l've asked Chakotay
to find out exactly

15:23.555 --> 15:24.920
what caused the accident,

15:25.024 --> 15:26.651
and unless we can take
additional precautions,

15:26.725 --> 15:28.784
l'm not sending another
team into that nebula.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.089
l could help
with that investigation.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.254
No. You are taking
some time off

15:31.330 --> 15:32.262
and that's an order.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.298
No, Captain, please

15:33.365 --> 15:35.196
l don't need
any special treatment.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.498
Neelix, you've just
returned from the dead.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.663
Go easy on yourself.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.798
l suppose you're right.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.971
But you can't ask me to cancel
the first night of Prixin.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.377
The celebration
is in three days.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.778
Oh, l almost forgot.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.975
l've been aging fruit compote
in moolt nectar for weeks now.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.916
l- l can't just let it
go to waste.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.647
Only if you feel up to it.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.450
But could you not
ferment those compotes

15:57.523 --> 15:58.455
so long this time?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.458
Because last year, l got
a little light- headed.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.495
l'll make
the necessary adjustments.

16:03.562 --> 16:04.859
lt's good to have you back.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.295
lt's good to be back,
Captain.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.117
Alixia...

16:38.697 --> 16:40.426
why weren't you there?

16:45.738 --> 16:48.673
Human attitudes toward
death are perplexing.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.606
How so?

16:50.676 --> 16:52.541
Too much importance
is placed on it.

16:52.611 --> 16:55.409
There seem to be countless
rituals and cultural beliefs

16:55.481 --> 16:59.247
designed to alleviate their fear
of a simple, biological truth--

16:59.318 --> 17:01.616
all organisms eventually perish.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.554
l take it the Borg have no fear
of that biological truth.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.856
None. When a drone is damaged
beyond repair, it is discarded,

17:08.926 --> 17:10.861
but its memories
continue to exist

17:10.929 --> 17:12.829
in the collective consciousness.

17:12.897 --> 17:17.061
To use a human term,
the Borg are"immortal."

17:18.137 --> 17:20.230
You are no longer
part of the collective.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.704
You are mortal now,
like the rest of us.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.071
Does that disturb you?

17:26.545 --> 17:29.275
My connection to the Borg
has been severed,

17:29.348 --> 17:32.875
but the collective still
possesses my recollections,

17:32.951 --> 17:34.509
my experiences.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.680
ln a sense, l will always exist.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.223
Fascinating.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.088
That must be a great relief.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.060
Yes.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.652
lt is.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.259
l've sealed the fractures
in the shuttle nacelle.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.427
The rest of the repairs
should be completed by morning.

17:51.503 --> 17:52.800
Good.
How are you coming?

17:52.871 --> 17:55.465
l found a small phase variance
in the transporter logs.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.907
l think it was responsible
for igniting the protomatter.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.308
l've remodulated the transporter
beam to compensate.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.643
Good work.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.272
l'll be in Holodeck 2.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.214
l've created a simulation
of the shuttle accident

18:06.285 --> 18:08.116
to see if there's anything
we've overlooked.

18:10.989 --> 18:12.547
Commander.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.784
Commander, l thought
you might need

18:13.859 --> 18:14.848
some assistance on the holodeck.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.859
lf you're feeling up to it.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.691
Well, l'm up to anything
at this point.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.526
l've been resting
for two days straight

18:19.598 --> 18:21.566
and resting makes me feel,
well, restless.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.236
l've programmed the simulation

18:28.307 --> 18:30.104
to start when we found
the protomatter.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.473
Why don't you monitor the
containment field readings?

18:32.544 --> 18:34.171
Gladly.

18:34.246 --> 18:36.077
Computer, display shuttle crew--

18:36.148 --> 18:38.378
excluding myself--
and begin program.

18:39.952 --> 18:44.184
There's a concentration
of protomatter directly ahead.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.622
Set the transporter
for 10, 000 AMUs.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.920
Not a particle more.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.392
The containment field
is standing by.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.396
We're in range.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.200
The transporter beam
ignited the protomatter.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.702
Computer, freeze program.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.169
lt looks like there
was a problem

19:00.239 --> 19:01.297
with the pattern buffer.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.034
lt might have created
a feedback loop

19:03.108 --> 19:04.370
along the transporter beam.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.467
Sounds right.

19:05.544 --> 19:06.704
Let's keep an eye on it.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.837
See what happened
at the moment of impact.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.575
Computer, resume program.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.676
Shields are weakening.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.211
Shields are down!

19:17.289 --> 19:19.849
l've got the sample, Commander,
and it's stable.

19:19.958 --> 19:20.925
Let's get out of...

19:24.596 --> 19:26.723
Computer, freeze program.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.640
Nothing.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.577
What?

19:42.648 --> 19:47.415
l died, and there was nothing.

19:47.486 --> 19:50.546
There was no one there.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.556
No forest.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.558
Forest?

19:54.626 --> 19:57.823
The Great Forest.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.330
The afterlife.

20:00.399 --> 20:05.928
l was taught that when l died,
my ancestors would be there

20:06.071 --> 20:08.539
waiting for me
by the Guiding Tree.

20:10.242 --> 20:15.077
My sisters, my mother
and father, my cousins...

20:15.147 --> 20:18.116
everyone who was killed
in the war.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.516
l took great comfort

20:21.587 --> 20:25.751
in knowing that we'd all
be together again one day,

20:25.824 --> 20:28.725
but it's not true.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.160
Maybe we pulled you back
before any of that could happen.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.697
No.

20:32.764 --> 20:33.753
l was dead for 18 hours.

20:33.832 --> 20:34.799
l should have...

20:35.968 --> 20:36.992
experienced something.

20:37.102 --> 20:38.501
l should remember something!

20:42.708 --> 20:44.676
lt's just a story.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.903
A myth.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.048
There is no Guiding Tree.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.879
No gathering of the ancestors.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.010
You can't be certain of that.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.679
Don't throw away
a lifetime of faith

20:56.755 --> 20:58.279
because
of one anomalous incident.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.918
Death is still the greatest
mystery there is.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.585
l was there.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.857
l experienced it.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.489
There was nothing.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.964
Computer, delete characters.

21:13.905 --> 21:16.237
That's what's going to happen
to all of us.

21:16.308 --> 21:19.675
Like a hologram--
we just disappear into nothing.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.358
Attention.
Attention.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.561
lf l may have
everyone's attention.

21:47.739 --> 21:48.706
You might want to try

21:48.774 --> 21:50.401
the old"glass and spoon"
approach.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.601
"Glass and spoon"?

21:54.413 --> 21:55.505
Excuse me.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.186
Thank you.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.755
Welcome to the first
night of Prixin--

22:08.827 --> 22:11.921
the Talaxian observance
of familial allegiance.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.022
This year,
Mr. Neelix has requested

22:14.099 --> 22:15.930
that l commence the celebration

22:16.001 --> 22:17.866
with the traditional salutation.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.668
"We do not stand alone.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.935
"We are in the arms of family.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.340
"Father, mother,

22:26.411 --> 22:29.175
"sister, brother,

22:29.247 --> 22:30.771
"father's father,

22:30.849 --> 22:33.579
"father's mother,

22:33.652 --> 22:35.415
"father's brother,

22:35.487 --> 22:37.284
"mother's brother...

22:38.824 --> 22:40.689
fath..."

22:40.759 --> 22:43.956
Suffice to say,
the list is extensive.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.793
"We gather on this day
to extol the warmth and joy

22:46.865 --> 22:48.992
"of those unshakable bonds.

22:49.101 --> 22:52.229
"Without them, we could not
call ourselves complete.

22:52.304 --> 22:55.933
"On this day,
we are thankful to be together.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.475
We do not stand alone."

22:58.543 --> 22:59.475
lndeed, we do not.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.408
Here, here.

23:01.580 --> 23:05.676
A few days ago, we almost lost
a member of our family.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.241
l don't know how
the rest of you feel,

23:07.319 --> 23:09.116
but it scared
the hell out of me.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.586
Neelix,

23:10.655 --> 23:13.590
you still don't know
how to make a pizza...

23:14.626 --> 23:15.593
but l'm glad you're here.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.820
So am l.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.795
Here's to you, Neelix.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.973
Speech.

23:34.312 --> 23:35.540
Thank you, everyone.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.543
Well...

23:42.988 --> 23:44.751
enjoy.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.087
Computer, music.

23:54.533 --> 23:55.659
You all right?

23:55.734 --> 23:56.928
Fine, Commander, fine.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.405
l apologize for the other
day on the holodeck.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.032
l guess this whole"back
from the dead" thing

24:05.076 --> 24:06.407
is hard to get used to.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.070
l'm fine now.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.910
lf you ever want to talk,
you know where to find me.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.680
Having fun?

24:19.758 --> 24:20.884
No.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.551
That's probably

24:22.627 --> 24:25.255
because you've been standing
here by yourself.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.059
l don't understand the rules
and procedures

24:27.132 --> 24:29.760
for this type of...
social occasion.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.132
The rules are simple.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.671
Choose a group of people.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.933
Listen to their conversation.

24:36.074 --> 24:37.268
Then when you feel

24:37.342 --> 24:40.311
like you have something
to contribute, chime in.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.073
"Chime in"?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.978
You say something.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.573
Join the discussion.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.879
l will try, Captain.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.556
The early stages
of Ktarian development

24:54.626 --> 24:55.991
are astounding.

24:56.061 --> 24:58.529
Naomi has grown five centimeters
since her last physical

24:58.597 --> 24:59.791
and that was
only three weeks ago.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.492
lt seems like every time
l turn around,

25:01.600 --> 25:04.296
l'm recycling her clothes
back into the replicator.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.701
Children assimilated
by the Borg

25:05.770 --> 25:07.237
are placed
in maturation chambers

25:07.305 --> 25:08.863
for 17 cycles.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.077
lnteresting.

25:13.144 --> 25:17.103
Well, if you'll excuse me,
l need to go talk to Neelix.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.481
ln these maturation chambers,

25:20.552 --> 25:22.486
the development
of conversational skills

25:22.554 --> 25:25.853
is, l suppose, a low priority?

25:25.924 --> 25:27.118
Neelix.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.420
Oh!

25:28.493 --> 25:29.425
l'm sorry.

25:29.494 --> 25:30.791
No, no, no, it's all right.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.456
We haven't seen you
in a few days.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.191
l've been a little preoccupied.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.668
l understand.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.398
Naomi's been asking
about you.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.030
Really?

25:42.107 --> 25:44.507
She misses you,
and, frankly, so do l.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.806
She's had trouble sleeping
every night this week.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.470
"Only Neelix can tuck me in."

25:48.547 --> 25:49.479
"l want Neelix."

25:49.548 --> 25:52.073
lt sounds familiar.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.345
Maybe you could stop by
later just to say hello.

25:54.419 --> 25:56.216
Why don't...

25:56.288 --> 25:57.653
why don't l go now?

25:57.722 --> 25:59.986
lt's close to Naomi's bedtime.

26:00.025 --> 26:00.992
Are you sure?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.993
Prixin's your favorite holiday.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.052
Yes, but duty calls.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.166
Attention, all monsters.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.965
Get out of this room!

26:13.038 --> 26:14.835
My bed!

26:14.906 --> 26:17.397
Oh, there's no monsters here.

26:19.377 --> 26:20.344
lt's a monster!

26:20.412 --> 26:22.141
Scared you!

26:22.213 --> 26:24.078
You certainly did.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.310
Pleasant dreams, sweeting.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.909
Can you stay longer?

26:29.020 --> 26:31.921
l want to hear
about the Great Forest again.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.582
The Great Forest?

26:33.658 --> 26:34.920
The special place.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.553
The place you think about
when you can't sleep.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.558
Are you sure you want
to hear about that?

26:41.633 --> 26:42.759
lt's just a silly old story.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.267
Please.

26:47.038 --> 26:48.369
Well...

26:51.343 --> 26:53.504
it's a beautiful place,

26:53.578 --> 26:55.671
filled with sunlight...

26:55.747 --> 26:58.773
And all the people
who ever loved me.

27:00.485 --> 27:03.147
Yes.
They've all gathered there...

27:04.756 --> 27:08.192
to watch over you,
to protect you while you sleep.

27:08.259 --> 27:11.990
l had a dream about
the Great Forest last night.

27:12.063 --> 27:14.293
You did?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.766
There was trees,

27:16.835 --> 27:18.029
and grass,

27:18.103 --> 27:19.661
and animals.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.296
And l saw you and Mommy

27:21.373 --> 27:22.897
and we were all happy.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.540
Sounds like a nice dream.

27:26.611 --> 27:28.806
lt was beautiful.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.918
The Doctor asked me
to run a hematological scan.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.462
Why?

27:45.530 --> 27:46.827
To regulate the dosage
of nanoprobes

27:46.898 --> 27:48.229
for your next injection.

27:54.939 --> 27:55.963
Go ahead.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.240
How much longer will l
be needing these injections?

28:01.346 --> 28:03.780
Until your damaged cells
can function on their own.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.815
l don't really like the
idea of Borg technology

28:08.887 --> 28:11.014
swimming around inside me.

28:11.089 --> 28:12.215
That is irrelevant.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.190
You need the nanoprobes
to live.

28:14.259 --> 28:15.419
"Live"?

28:15.493 --> 28:18.326
Oh, is that what l am
doing right now, living?

28:18.396 --> 28:20.864
l'm beginning to wonder.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.832
By most definitions,
you are alive.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.233
Well, part of me isn't alive.

28:25.303 --> 28:27.066
Which part
are you referring to?

28:27.138 --> 28:29.072
l don't know,
but something is missing.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.267
l don't feel
like Neelix anymore.

28:31.342 --> 28:34.106
Maybe Neelix is gone.

28:34.179 --> 28:36.511
Maybe he died
and l'm all that's left.

28:36.581 --> 28:39.049
Stop moving and allow me
to complete the scan.

28:39.117 --> 28:42.177
l- l didn't ask
to be brought back!

28:42.253 --> 28:43.618
You were dead at the time.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.815
Well, what right did you have
to violate me?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.289
You Borg think
you can fix anything,

28:47.358 --> 28:48.882
but you didn't fix me!

28:48.960 --> 28:50.427
There was no alternative.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.689
Just get out.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.697
Just leave me alone!

28:53.765 --> 28:54.925
l said get out!

28:54.999 --> 28:57.524
l would be negligent in
my duties if l did that.

28:57.602 --> 28:58.626
l don't care about your duties!

28:58.703 --> 28:59.670
l don't care...

29:11.583 --> 29:13.551
What's...

29:13.618 --> 29:14.880
what's happening to me?

29:16.254 --> 29:18.518
Your cells are reverting
to a necrotic state.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.784
We must get you to Sick Bay.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.731
His tissue began
rejecting the nanoprobes,

29:26.798 --> 29:29.426
causing spontaneous necrosis
throughout his body.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.492
We modified the nanoprobes
to compensate

29:31.569 --> 29:33.036
and it appears to be working--

29:33.104 --> 29:35.129
Neelix is stable...
for now.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.696
How do we know this
won't happen again?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.608
We don't. l've designed
a monitor for Neelix to wear

29:39.677 --> 29:41.736
that will alert us
at the first sign of necrosis

29:41.813 --> 29:43.781
and we'll continue
with the daily injections.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.908
Beyond that, l'm afraid
it's a...

29:46.985 --> 29:48.350
matter of maintenance.

29:48.419 --> 29:49.909
He may have to live
with this condition

29:49.988 --> 29:51.046
for the rest of his life.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.987
He wants to speak
with you, Commander.

29:58.596 --> 30:03.033
Commander...you said
if l ever needed anything.

30:03.101 --> 30:06.468
You once told me
your people had technology

30:06.538 --> 30:08.369
that can induce
a deep meditation--

30:08.439 --> 30:10.430
an altered state
of consciousness.

30:10.508 --> 30:11.702
The akoonah.

30:11.776 --> 30:14.973
That this device allows you
to look inside yourself,

30:15.046 --> 30:19.983
ask questions that you might
otherwise be afraid to ask.

30:20.051 --> 30:20.983
That's right.

30:21.085 --> 30:22.416
That's what l need.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.478
l need to look inside myself...

30:24.556 --> 30:26.080
figure out
what's happening to me.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.886
l need answers.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.450
Will you help me, Commander?

30:31.496 --> 30:33.964
All right...

30:34.032 --> 30:36.193
but l want you to understand

30:36.267 --> 30:38.428
the vision quest
isn't a quick fix.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.869
lt'll take time
to interpret the images

30:40.939 --> 30:41.963
and there's no guarantee

30:42.040 --> 30:43.632
you'll find
what you're looking for.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.642
l understand.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.837
What should l do to prepare?

30:47.912 --> 30:50.244
You'll need a medicine bundle.

30:50.315 --> 30:54.376
ltems that define you,
things that will ground you,

30:54.452 --> 30:56.511
allow you to take the journey
into yourself.

30:57.555 --> 30:59.648
l'll get ready.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.153
This belonged to my sister,
Alixia.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.924
She made it
during our expedition

31:05.997 --> 31:07.396
to the Dunes of Talmouth.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.431
A flower from Kes's garden.

31:15.740 --> 31:19.403
And last, but not least,
the Guiding Tree.

31:19.477 --> 31:22.674
lt stands at the center
of Talaxian afterlife,

31:22.747 --> 31:25.147
deep inside the Great Forest.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.446
lt's there to help
us find our way

31:27.518 --> 31:28.917
when we first arrive.

31:28.987 --> 31:31.649
At least, that's what
l used to believe.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.689
Not a very impressive
medicine bundle, is it?

31:36.761 --> 31:38.228
lt'll do fine.

31:38.296 --> 31:41.322
Now, place your hand
on the akoonah.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.162
Am l doing this right?

31:46.237 --> 31:47.932
Try to relax.

31:48.006 --> 31:51.840
Clear your mind of everything
but the objects before you.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.071
Focus on them.
Nothing else exists.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.120
Ah- koo- chee- moya.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.522
We are far
from the sacred places

32:08.593 --> 32:10.060
of our grandfathers.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.596
We are far from the bones
of our people.

32:12.664 --> 32:15.690
We come here seeking guidance.

32:17.168 --> 32:19.033
lt's time, Neelix.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.537
Try to leave this room,
this ship...

32:21.606 --> 32:22.868
and go to a place
where you were

32:22.941 --> 32:25.705
the most peaceful and content
you have ever been.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.109
That's where your journey
will begin.

32:37.488 --> 32:40.184
Neelix...good to have you back.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.089
lt's- it's good to be
back, Lieutenant.

32:47.598 --> 32:48.587
Alixia?

32:52.036 --> 32:55.130
Alixia, it's me, Neelix!

32:55.206 --> 32:56.298
Over here.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.641
Captain!
My sister--

33:04.716 --> 33:06.741
she was just standing here
talking to you.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.217
The dead girl.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.015
Oh, yes. Very charming.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.818
l can see
the family resemblance.

33:12.890 --> 33:14.380
Alixia!

33:17.595 --> 33:19.119
You will be assimilated.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.256
No time for that now.
Maybe later.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.266
Potent stuff.

33:33.644 --> 33:36.909
lt's...lt's beautiful.

33:36.981 --> 33:40.644
Yes. lt's just like you
always imagined it would be.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.811
The trees, the sunlight,

33:42.887 --> 33:44.980
and all the people
who ever loved you.

33:45.056 --> 33:50.722
When l died, l looked for you,
but you weren't there.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.729
Why weren't you there?

33:52.797 --> 33:54.492
Because it's all a lie.

33:54.565 --> 33:55.827
What do you mean?

33:55.900 --> 33:59.233
You've wasted
your entire life believing lies.

33:59.303 --> 34:00.634
The"Great Forest."

34:00.738 --> 34:04.139
The"afterlife."

34:04.175 --> 34:06.609
lt's all created
out of your fear of death.

34:06.677 --> 34:08.201
None of it's real.

34:08.279 --> 34:11.248
lf that's true,
what's the point of living?

34:11.315 --> 34:12.475
There isn't any.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.213
That's what you're finally
starting to realize.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.813
l'm afraid to go to sleep.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.085
Tell me about the Great Forest,
Neelix.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.286
Tell me about the trees
and the grass

34:24.362 --> 34:26.626
and all the people
who loved you.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.790
Why are you saying these things?

34:29.967 --> 34:31.127
Scared you!

35:08.106 --> 35:11.542
You died on that shuttlecraft,
Neelix.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.736
They never should have
brought you back.

35:13.811 --> 35:17.247
lt was a mistake
and you know it.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.112
Now accept it.

35:20.218 --> 35:21.776
You know what you have to do.

35:23.521 --> 35:24.749
No.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.257
lt's all a lie.
They lied to you.

35:29.327 --> 35:31.420
You know what you have to do.

35:31.496 --> 35:34.522
We gather on this day
to tell Neelix what he must do.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.794
You stand alone.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.062
Life is irrelevant.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.467
Let go.

35:39.537 --> 35:40.731
lt's pointless.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.796
lt's a lie.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.843
You know what you have to do.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.378
No!

36:00.825 --> 36:02.452
Neelix.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.654
Oh, there you are.
l didn't see you.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.321
Are you looking for me?

36:06.397 --> 36:08.228
Yes, as a matter of fact, l am.

36:08.299 --> 36:09.766
l hope l'm not disturbing you.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.461
You are not.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.595
l...

36:13.671 --> 36:17.334
l want to apologize
for my outburst the other day

36:17.408 --> 36:18.375
in the Mess Hall.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.273
No apology is necessary.

36:20.344 --> 36:23.575
No. No, please,
my behavior was uncalled for.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.479
l didn't mean the things l said.

36:25.550 --> 36:26.482
l wasn't myself.

36:26.551 --> 36:29.520
But l feel much better now.

36:29.587 --> 36:31.817
Commander Chakotay
has helped me to...

36:31.889 --> 36:33.447
understand a few things.

36:33.524 --> 36:37.051
l want you to know
that l don't blame you

36:37.128 --> 36:38.288
for bringing me back.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.159
To life, l mean.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.358
ln fact, what you did
was very thoughtful.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.731
l would have done the same
for any member of this crew.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.168
Yes. l'm sure you would have.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.234
ls there something else?

36:51.309 --> 36:53.243
No.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.875
Yes.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.382
Seven, l think you've made

36:59.450 --> 37:01.281
a wonderful addition
to this crew.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.512
l know it's been
difficult for you

37:03.554 --> 37:06.523
making the transition
from Borg back to human.

37:06.591 --> 37:07.990
Or half human.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.424
Or whatever it is you've become.

37:09.493 --> 37:11.290
Actually, you're
just plain Seven to me.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.262
Your point, Mr. Neelix.

37:13.331 --> 37:16.164
l guess l just want to say...

37:19.403 --> 37:22.395
you're surrounded by people
who care about you.

37:22.473 --> 37:23.701
And whether you know it or not,

37:23.774 --> 37:25.833
Voyager is going to be
a very good home to you.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.377
lt certainly was to me.

37:27.445 --> 37:28.469
Was?

37:28.546 --> 37:30.070
Do you intend to leave?

37:31.515 --> 37:34.211
Leave?
No. l'll be around.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.246
Well...

37:39.523 --> 37:40.649
good- bye.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.124
Good- bye.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.231
What happened to you
this morning?

37:54.305 --> 37:57.433
l'm sorry l had to cancel
our little chat,

37:57.508 --> 37:59.942
but l was needed
in the Mess Hall.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.638
l've been so busy
the last few days

38:01.679 --> 38:04.045
l let things slip around here.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.174
You're not holding up
your end of the bargain.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.081
What do you mean?

38:08.152 --> 38:10.985
When you asked me to guide you
on a vision quest l agreed,

38:11.055 --> 38:13.990
but l also told you it was part
of an ongoing process.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.083
We're supposed to be
discussing your progress.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.492
What's left to say?

38:18.562 --> 38:19.620
l've told you--

38:19.697 --> 38:22.359
l saw my sister,
the Great Forest.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.196
l feel a sense of peace

38:24.268 --> 38:26.862
l've never felt
in my entire life.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.632
lt worked.

38:28.706 --> 38:30.003
You've only lived
with the visions

38:30.074 --> 38:31.473
for a couple of days.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.601
That's not enough time
to draw any conclusions.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.545
You've got to reflect
on the images, examine them.

38:36.614 --> 38:39.048
Allow them to stay alive
in your mind.

38:39.116 --> 38:40.606
A vision quest isn't just
a dream you dismiss

38:40.685 --> 38:42.585
after your first cup of coffee.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.712
l understand.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.086
Good.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.216
l get off duty at 1400 hours.

38:48.292 --> 38:50.192
Meet me in my quarters
and we'll begin.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.558
That's an order.

38:51.629 --> 38:52.823
Yes, sir.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.985
Computer, lights off.

39:23.861 --> 39:26.125
And finally, Mr. Tuvok...

39:26.197 --> 39:30.657
l'm grateful for the opportunity
l had to win your respect.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.863
Your strength and your wisdom
were an inspiration to me

39:33.938 --> 39:36.964
and l can only hope
that your memory of me

39:37.041 --> 39:39.908
will serve to inspire you
in some way.

39:41.479 --> 39:45.711
lt was an honor to spend my last
years on Voyager with this crew.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.250
l want to thank all of you

39:47.318 --> 39:49.343
for your kindness
and companionship.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.354
Good- bye.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.256
Computer, end log
and code for delivery

39:55.326 --> 39:56.884
to Captain Janeway in one hour.

40:13.811 --> 40:15.278
Captain, someone's trying
to initiate

40:15.346 --> 40:17.712
an unauthorized transport.

40:17.782 --> 40:18.942
lt's Neelix.

40:19.016 --> 40:20.449
Where's he going?

40:20.518 --> 40:22.611
Looks like he's trying
to beam into the nebula.

40:23.654 --> 40:24.643
Stop him.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.546
Janeway to Neelix.

40:27.625 --> 40:28.956
Neelix, respond.

40:29.026 --> 40:32.154
Neelix, l order you
to disengage transport.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.725
He's found a way
to block the abort sequence.

40:38.803 --> 40:40.168
Transport's in progress.

40:40.237 --> 40:41.727
Override it! Get him back.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.146
Bridge to Chakotay.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.583
We've blocked
his transporter signal.

40:55.653 --> 40:57.348
You can slow me down,
but you can't stop me.

40:57.421 --> 40:59.582
What are you trying to do?

40:59.657 --> 41:00.988
l'm going back where l belong.

41:01.091 --> 41:02.251
You belong here, Neelix.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.521
Not anymore.

41:03.594 --> 41:04.754
l died in that nebula.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.023
You should've left me.

41:06.096 --> 41:07.563
- Neelix...
- No closer!

41:07.631 --> 41:09.428
l've created
a site- to- site transport.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.024
No one can override the signal.

41:11.101 --> 41:13.228
You told me you were at peace.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.070
l will be...
as soon as l tap this control.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.075
What really happened
in your vision quest?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.804
What did you see?

41:24.949 --> 41:28.407
My sister, the crew, myself.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.250
They all told me
the same thing--

41:31.322 --> 41:34.223
there's no point in living,
and l agree with them.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.225
l'm sure
those were powerful images,

41:36.293 --> 41:38.227
but there are many ways
to interpret them.

41:38.295 --> 41:40.991
You may be coming face- to- face
with your own fear of death.

41:41.098 --> 41:43.623
Or the manifestation
of your emotional crisis.

41:43.701 --> 41:46.261
Your deepest beliefs
have been thrown into doubt.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.965
lt's only natural the vision
quest would reflect that.

41:49.039 --> 41:54.067
1 1 years ago,
l saw my world in ruins...

41:56.213 --> 41:58.681
my family murdered.

41:58.749 --> 42:00.114
All that's kept me going

42:00.217 --> 42:03.084
is knowing that one day
we'd be together again.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.184
That l'd see them again.

42:09.026 --> 42:11.290
But it's not true.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.195
And l can't...
live without that hope.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.232
l understand how this

42:15.299 --> 42:17.233
can change
the way you look at things,

42:17.301 --> 42:20.099
but it can also lead
to an even stronger faith.

42:20.170 --> 42:21.865
You don't know.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.406
You're not there yet.

42:23.474 --> 42:25.101
Ensign Wildman to Neelix.

42:26.810 --> 42:28.072
Answer her!

42:28.145 --> 42:30.773
Neelix, please respond.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.316
No.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.752
You're being called
back to your life again, Neelix.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.686
Don't turn your back on it.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.952
We're your family now.

42:43.827 --> 42:45.124
lt's not enough.

42:45.195 --> 42:46.457
lt is for us.

42:46.530 --> 42:48.691
"His function on this crew
is diverse."

42:48.766 --> 42:50.495
That's what Seven of Nine
said about you.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.763
Even our Borg understands
how important

42:52.836 --> 42:54.667
you are on this ship.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.672
lt's not just the duties
you perform.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.436
lt's the way you make
people feel when you're around.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.909
That Neelix is gone.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.471
l don't think he is.

43:05.549 --> 43:07.517
Why didn't you answer me?

43:07.585 --> 43:10.110
l had to have the computer
track you down.

43:10.187 --> 43:13.020
Naomi thought she saw
a monster in the replicator.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.493
Neelix, what's going on?

43:22.266 --> 43:24.928
l'm trying to decide
some things.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.026
That little girl
needs you, Neelix.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.801
Monsters in the replicator?

43:30.874 --> 43:33.172
Who else on this ship
can handle that?

43:59.837 --> 44:01.464
Duty calls.

44:15.352 --> 44:16.319
Good night, sir.

44:16.387 --> 44:17.615
He says good night.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.785
Good night, Naomi.

44:22.860 --> 44:23.884
Good night.

44:27.264 --> 44:28.663
What's the matter?

44:28.732 --> 44:30.859
Mommy says you were sick.

44:30.934 --> 44:34.233
l was, but l'm okay now.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.067
Did a monster get you?

44:38.308 --> 44:41.106
Yes, l suppose so.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.738
But l chased him away.

44:45.683 --> 44:46.980
Pleasant dreams.
