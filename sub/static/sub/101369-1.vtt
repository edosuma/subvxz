00:31.490 --> 00:33.225
When I first heard
it, I don't know,

00:33.258 --> 00:34.727
but the elders say,

00:34.761 --> 00:36.294
"Every decision you make today

00:36.328 --> 00:38.597
affects
the next seven generations."

00:42.035 --> 00:43.136
Watch over me, Kookum.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.672
Protect me from harm.

00:45.705 --> 00:46.673
Have pity on me.

00:46.706 --> 00:49.809
Today just isn't today,
tomorrow can be today.

00:58.885 --> 01:00.585
She never told me her name.

01:02.755 --> 01:05.158
I never knew
what she was really doing then.

01:08.226 --> 01:10.562
So I called her "Kookum".

01:17.670 --> 01:20.106
She told me to
look to the future.

01:20.139 --> 01:24.576
And the future looked bright
until that day.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.568
Kookum, don't die.

02:56.936 --> 02:59.739
Margo, it's beautiful.

03:02.241 --> 03:04.043
<i>It's just like I remember.</i>

03:04.076 --> 03:06.212
<i>Kookum, used to take me here.</i>

03:07.980 --> 03:10.883
<i>Your "pretty",
remember is an idea.</i>

03:10.917 --> 03:12.051
<i>My choice.</i>

03:12.084 --> 03:13.252
<i>I'm picking up for you.</i>

03:26.598 --> 03:28.067
<i>Hey,
what are you wearing tonight?</i>

03:28.100 --> 03:29.635
Black, what else?

03:30.569 --> 03:31.804
<i>I wonder what he is announcing.</i>

03:31.838 --> 03:34.707
I don't know,
but it must be important.

03:39.946 --> 03:42.682
Oh no, shoot.

03:42.715 --> 03:43.950
Hang on a second.

03:43.983 --> 03:45.685
I'm having some issues.

03:48.453 --> 03:51.556
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

03:51.590 --> 03:55.761
<i>Strange,
the algorithm is not functioning.</i>

03:55.795 --> 03:57.096
<i>It's not responding.</i>

03:57.129 --> 04:03.336
<i>I'll try something else.</i>

04:05.470 --> 04:06.973
<i>The control module is exiting.</i>

04:07.006 --> 04:10.309
<i>It is not reaching the mnemonic
interfaces.</i>

04:10.343 --> 04:14.013
I'm unable to
access any memories.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.214
I think we have a malfunction.

04:16.249 --> 04:18.317
I can't feel any emotion.

04:18.351 --> 04:20.952
<i>It can't be,
it was working before.</i>

04:20.987 --> 04:22.822
<i>I think, I have to disengage.</i>

04:30.162 --> 04:31.998
<i>Is this gonna set you back?</i>

04:32.031 --> 04:34.599
<i>I hope not,
we release in a month.</i>

04:34.634 --> 04:35.668
<i>Stallman won't be happy,</i>

04:35.701 --> 04:37.837
<i>he's been pushing me to get it
done.</i>

04:37.870 --> 04:38.871
<i>I'm exiting.</i>

04:38.905 --> 04:40.907
<i>I'm bringing you back.</i>

05:02.594 --> 05:05.430
Red Eye is closed, Elise.

05:05.463 --> 05:09.501
Closed, but still unstable.

05:09.534 --> 05:12.305
Version 2 is gonna need
a few more tests.

05:12.338 --> 05:15.141
Tests, tests, tests.

05:15.174 --> 05:18.311
We'll catch it in Version 3.

05:18.344 --> 05:20.112
Well, it's just about ready.

05:20.146 --> 05:21.047
As soon as it hits,
we'll go out

05:21.080 --> 05:22.949
and get you the new imagination.

05:22.982 --> 05:24.016
One that actually suits you.

05:24.050 --> 05:25.851
My imagination's fine.

05:25.885 --> 05:27.687
That's where I meet
all the best men.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.889
Oh shit, we're gonna be late.

05:29.922 --> 05:31.057
Okay, let's go.

05:31.090 --> 05:33.359
<i>welcome to
this special presentation.</i>

05:33.392 --> 05:35.895
<i>We're pleased to introduce
Red Eye's founder,</i>

05:35.928 --> 05:37.863
<i>Conrad Stallman.</i>

05:45.137 --> 05:49.108
When I was young,
we kept our memories in a box.

05:49.141 --> 05:54.013
Photographs, tapes, mementos.

05:54.046 --> 05:59.385
<i>But that box could only hint
at what we had experienced.</i>

05:59.418 --> 06:04.957
<i>Those worn and torn baubles
or suggestions,</i>

06:04.991 --> 06:08.526
<i>insinuations
of those beloved memories.</i>

06:08.560 --> 06:10.296
But I always knew that someday
we would improve

06:10.329 --> 06:12.597
upon those trinkets

06:12.631 --> 06:17.403
and open our eyes to more
than we could ever remember.

06:17.436 --> 06:21.240
Red Eye
is the contact lens that

06:21.273 --> 06:25.044
the brilliant team here
has perfected in its simplicity.

06:35.454 --> 06:38.623
It records not
what the eye can see,

06:38.657 --> 06:40.793
but what the mind can remember.

06:51.971 --> 06:54.539
I invite you to see with me.

06:54.572 --> 06:57.109
<i>We are made up
of our experiences</i>

06:57.143 --> 07:00.646
and of the memories
of those experiences.

07:00.679 --> 07:04.549
Now your memories are no longer
a thing of the past.

07:04.582 --> 07:08.387
Be where you remember being.

07:08.421 --> 07:14.026
See old friends, family.

07:14.060 --> 07:18.864
We harnessed a Universal
Recognition Matrix, a URM

07:18.898 --> 07:23.335
and put it in Red Eye
to bring your memories back.

07:23.369 --> 07:26.205
Restore them from the past.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.240
So what was...

07:28.274 --> 07:29.308
Elise.

07:29.341 --> 07:30.376
It's not ready.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.609
Now is.

07:31.644 --> 07:33.679
Your memories are no longer
a thing of the past.

07:33.712 --> 07:36.482
This is the new Red Eye.

07:39.617 --> 07:40.953
Elise.

07:40.986 --> 07:43.689
Elise, wait up!

07:44.423 --> 07:46.759
Elise.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.494
- Did you hear him?
- Hear what?

07:48.527 --> 07:50.296
- What he said.
- What's wrong?

07:50.329 --> 07:52.431
I don't understand
what's going on.

07:52.465 --> 07:54.066
It's not right, Margo.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.167
What's not right?

07:58.704 --> 08:02.074
Okay, I guess some doors
aren't meant to be opened.

08:02.108 --> 08:03.075
Margo, hold on.

08:03.109 --> 08:04.176
What?

08:16.722 --> 08:18.290
Do me a favor.

08:18.324 --> 08:19.758
This is my password,

08:19.792 --> 08:23.195
I want you to promise me
you're gonna keep it protected.

08:23.229 --> 08:24.263
What?
Why?

08:24.296 --> 08:25.998
We're not supposed to commingle
our accounts.

08:26.031 --> 08:27.967
Consider yourself
my backup plan.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.269
Why? 'Cause your genius
mind is gonna forget it.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.142
Okay, Dr. Perrot.

08:41.714 --> 08:43.482
I understand that
you're worried, right,

08:43.515 --> 08:45.518
this is a lot of pressure.

08:45.551 --> 08:49.255
But the core of this
is your creation,

08:49.288 --> 08:51.590
so remember that.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.558
Shit.

09:30.596 --> 09:32.398
I need to speak with URM.

11:00.886 --> 11:02.722
Hey!

11:02.756 --> 11:04.790
Hey help, stop please!

11:04.823 --> 11:06.492
What are you doing?

11:17.836 --> 11:21.473
Stop, please let me out!

11:21.507 --> 11:23.475
No, you can't.

11:45.431 --> 11:46.832
You never knew.

11:46.865 --> 11:48.735
Kookum, don't die.

11:48.768 --> 11:49.736
You can't, I won't let you.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.371
You can't go.

11:53.740 --> 11:57.376
Margo.

11:57.409 --> 12:00.512
Throw it, throw it.

12:00.546 --> 12:03.515
Don't be afraid.

12:25.739 --> 12:26.840
<i>And in other news,</i>

12:26.872 --> 12:30.275
<i>Red Eye's senior
personnel developer Elise Perrot</i>

12:30.309 --> 12:35.047
<i>was found dead last night
after alleged suicide.</i>

12:35.080 --> 12:37.449
<i>Police are investigating
further.</i>

12:37.483 --> 12:39.485
<i>And in our lead stories...</i>

12:51.930 --> 12:55.601
Excuse me,
are you the detective?

12:55.635 --> 12:57.704
Till someone tells me otherwise.

13:12.752 --> 13:17.022
Officer, did you notice
there were signs of a struggle?

13:17.055 --> 13:19.859
But she had no defensive wounds.

13:19.893 --> 13:23.095
No cuts on her forearms,
no bruising the wrists.

13:23.128 --> 13:26.131
She didn't protect herself.

13:26.165 --> 13:29.067
What I need you to is I need you
to secure this scene.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.269
And you call the boys
from the lab,

13:30.302 --> 13:34.139
get them to come down,
do the usual thorough survey.

13:34.173 --> 13:36.542
I wanna know exactly
what happened here.

13:36.575 --> 13:39.679
Playing by the book these days?

13:39.712 --> 13:42.481
Yeah.

13:42.514 --> 13:44.450
I am.

13:46.886 --> 13:48.554
Excuse me, ma'am,
this is a crime scene.

13:52.759 --> 13:54.092
Hey, whoah, whoah, whoah,
you can't be here.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.795
Get outta here, go.

13:55.829 --> 13:56.663
Hey, you can't be here.

13:56.696 --> 13:58.197
Who are you?

13:58.230 --> 13:59.933
Margo.

13:59.965 --> 14:04.904
Elise and I work...
worked with Elise

14:04.938 --> 14:07.774
on Project Red Eye.

14:07.807 --> 14:09.007
Who are you?

14:09.041 --> 14:12.010
I'm Thomas Elliot,
Detective Thomas Elliot.

14:12.044 --> 14:15.080
Yeah, I'm...
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:15.113 --> 14:17.851
What were you working on here?

14:17.884 --> 14:20.085
It's called "Red Eye".

14:20.118 --> 14:21.921
It reads the genetic data
of retinal vein blood cells

14:21.955 --> 14:23.455
to recruit memories.

14:23.489 --> 14:25.057
To be blunt,
I pretend to understand

14:25.090 --> 14:28.293
what you just said,
but I... I don't.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.963
Now was there anything strange
about her behavior

14:29.995 --> 14:32.966
in the last few days?

14:32.998 --> 14:35.400
No, I mean stressed, but...

14:35.434 --> 14:37.436
Right.

14:37.469 --> 14:39.571
How well do you two
know each other?

14:39.605 --> 14:42.307
We were friends.

14:42.341 --> 14:46.278
Co-workers.

14:46.311 --> 14:49.581
Margo, I'm sorry for your loss.

14:49.615 --> 14:50.984
I'm gonna give you my card.

14:51.016 --> 14:54.086
You'll reach out
if you think anything, okay?

14:54.119 --> 14:55.287
I want you to give
your contact information

14:55.320 --> 14:56.421
to the officer when you leave,

14:56.455 --> 14:58.457
in case
I need to reach out to you.

15:04.162 --> 15:06.198
What happened to her?

15:06.231 --> 15:07.800
I only found out about her
this morning.

15:07.834 --> 15:10.369
Well, Mr. Stallman, right now
we have a lot more questions

15:10.402 --> 15:13.539
about her death than answers
I'm afraid.

15:13.572 --> 15:15.975
I assume you guys have
security cameras that cover

15:16.009 --> 15:18.043
the lab and the hallway
leading up to it.

15:18.076 --> 15:21.547
Detective,
may I call you "Thomas"?

15:21.580 --> 15:23.048
Sure.

15:23.081 --> 15:24.951
Can I call you, "Conrad"?

15:26.686 --> 15:28.487
Thomas, you'll have access
to everything you need,

15:28.520 --> 15:29.521
I'll see to it.

15:29.555 --> 15:30.556
Great.

15:32.692 --> 15:36.896
And what exactly does Tower
do for you guys again?

15:36.930 --> 15:39.032
They provide security.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.700
And they report directly to you?

15:40.733 --> 15:41.634
Everything?

15:41.668 --> 15:44.771
Thomas, I'll give you
everything I know.

15:44.804 --> 15:48.741
Well, thank you, Conrad.

16:18.071 --> 16:20.105
What the fuck?

16:20.138 --> 16:22.507
No one else entered the room.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.715
<i>Hello</i>.

16:28.748 --> 16:30.683
<i>Hello, Margo.</i>

16:30.717 --> 16:32.986
It's Detective Elliot.

16:33.019 --> 16:34.252
Just going over
some security footage

16:34.286 --> 16:36.889
from the night of Elise's death.

16:36.923 --> 16:38.758
Now you're sure
there was nothing unusual

16:38.791 --> 16:40.592
in her behavior in the days
leading up to her death,

16:40.627 --> 16:44.097
no new people, no new stresses,
nothing?

16:44.129 --> 16:47.033
<i>She's... she was fine</i>.

16:47.066 --> 16:50.435
Okay.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.471
I don't get it.

16:52.504 --> 16:54.674
I'll have to
take a look at her place.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.611
Detective?

17:37.116 --> 17:38.651
You know, you could've just
asked me

17:38.685 --> 17:40.185
for the key to the door.

17:40.218 --> 17:42.922
Are scientists
always this disorganized?

17:42.955 --> 17:44.189
It's field work.

17:44.222 --> 17:47.292
No, no, this is messy.

17:47.325 --> 17:50.529
Looks like she brought
all her work home with her.

17:50.562 --> 17:53.498
She obviously needed
a little extra help.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.001
What do you mean?

17:55.034 --> 17:58.203
The police find this
and it's way too easy

17:58.236 --> 18:00.640
to dismiss this
as just another drug case.

18:00.673 --> 18:02.507
Wait a second,
I thought you were the police.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.944
I... I am a detective,
but we think

18:04.977 --> 18:06.879
a little more highly
of ourselves.

18:06.913 --> 18:10.549
Oh yeah, you're telling me.

18:10.582 --> 18:13.218
Why do we always want things
to be easy?

18:19.291 --> 18:21.761
This is making me feel
very uneasy.

18:21.794 --> 18:22.662
Hmm.

18:22.695 --> 18:24.563
You really wanna help, Margo?

18:26.099 --> 18:28.533
Yeah.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.836
Okay.

18:29.869 --> 18:34.040
We have to go through everything
in this apartment.

18:34.073 --> 18:36.676
Why don't you start
with this field work?

18:51.691 --> 18:54.426
I mean
no wonder she needed drugs.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.129
She was on
the bleeding edge of her work.

18:56.162 --> 18:57.864
Some of this stuff is beyond me.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.270
What are you doing?

19:05.303 --> 19:07.707
Checking the expiry date.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.776
It's a little bit iffy.

19:19.118 --> 19:20.585
There's nothing here.

19:20.619 --> 19:21.988
Hey, we know that
she paid her taxes.

19:22.021 --> 19:23.488
Mhmm.

19:23.522 --> 19:27.627
And we know that she's no longer
in contact with her parents.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.863
And... and we know that
she loves fairy tales.

19:40.338 --> 19:43.242
Through the looking glass.

19:43.276 --> 19:44.609
Excuse me?

19:46.045 --> 19:47.880
You find something?

19:49.314 --> 19:51.284
Elise's password.

19:53.820 --> 19:56.956
Oh my God, Thomas.

19:56.989 --> 20:01.194
Look.

20:06.199 --> 20:08.835
It says, "Jade Drayden".

20:08.868 --> 20:11.336
Who is that?

20:11.369 --> 20:13.371
You're in for a treat.

20:32.591 --> 20:33.993
Fuck!

20:36.329 --> 20:39.332
The department's been
watching Jade for some time.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.599
She's in a warehouse up north

20:40.633 --> 20:42.168
and she's porting enough
IP addresses

20:42.201 --> 20:44.536
for a small country.

20:44.569 --> 20:46.105
What does she have to do
with Elise?

20:46.138 --> 20:47.372
That's a good question.

20:47.405 --> 20:50.542
I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'll find out.

20:50.575 --> 20:51.944
Law enforcement
and experimental science

20:51.978 --> 20:54.213
have a ton in common
just in case you wondered.

20:54.247 --> 20:55.513
How so?

20:55.547 --> 20:58.483
In being a relentless snoop,
goes with stubbornness.

20:58.516 --> 20:59.819
Yeah,
I did notice that about you.

20:59.852 --> 21:00.786
It's okay, I forgive you.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.755
Shut up.

21:04.891 --> 21:06.424
Okay, fine.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.862
We gotta swing by
my place first.

21:09.896 --> 21:10.997
What?

21:11.030 --> 21:13.933
I've been gone for 12 hours,
I have to feed my cat.

21:13.966 --> 21:15.635
Oh.

21:16.836 --> 21:18.104
So, why do you drive
this old beater anyway?

21:18.137 --> 21:21.674
Because modern tracker
circuits can find you anywhere.

21:21.707 --> 21:23.575
I'd never trust a car
with a chip in it.

21:23.608 --> 21:25.678
This old baby, no one
can find us in this thing.

21:25.711 --> 21:27.947
Yeah, I don't blame you.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.015
Ow!

21:32.318 --> 21:34.053
Oh, my... my head, I don't know.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.388
What, you have a migraine?

21:38.391 --> 21:40.893
No, I don't get them.

21:40.927 --> 21:42.361
Look,
I got some painkillers inside,

21:42.395 --> 21:43.729
I'll be right back.

21:43.763 --> 21:46.232
Thomas... just...

21:47.400 --> 21:48.566
Be careful.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.869
Be careful about what,
I'm gonna feed my cat

21:49.902 --> 21:51.704
not a lion.

21:51.737 --> 21:53.272
Look, hang tight,
I'll grab some pills,

21:53.306 --> 21:54.740
then we'll go see Jade.

22:01.881 --> 22:03.349
Rufus?

22:05.918 --> 22:08.087
Hey, Rufus.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.824
You hungry, boy?

22:11.857 --> 22:13.558
Rufus?

22:14.492 --> 22:17.595
Are you hiding down there?

22:17.630 --> 22:19.365
Are you pissed at me, boy?

22:26.105 --> 22:28.741
Supposed to take this stuff.

22:33.578 --> 22:34.914
What do you want?

22:34.947 --> 22:38.017
Just shut your mouth.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.086
I didn't know he was there,
I swear to God, I didn't know.

22:43.255 --> 22:46.058
He's my only son.

22:46.092 --> 22:48.060
A great kid.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.734
I just want my boy back.

22:54.767 --> 22:58.304
I wish I could give you
your boy back, I do.

22:58.337 --> 22:59.839
I'm sorry.

23:04.643 --> 23:06.212
You don't deserve to live.

23:09.415 --> 23:11.050
Oh fuck.

23:14.086 --> 23:17.189
Hey, hey!

23:17.223 --> 23:18.190
Hey, wait, wait!

23:18.224 --> 23:19.291
Hey!

23:19.325 --> 23:20.893
Hey!

23:20.926 --> 23:21.894
Wait!

23:27.800 --> 23:29.435
I'm sorry.

23:49.021 --> 23:49.688
Here you go.

23:49.722 --> 23:53.225
Sorry, I didn't have ice.

23:53.259 --> 23:54.559
Thank you.

23:57.696 --> 23:59.732
You knew that was gonna happen,
didn't you?

24:02.068 --> 24:03.369
Does that kind of stuff
happen to you a lot?

24:03.402 --> 24:05.738
Hmm.

24:05.771 --> 24:10.109
I... that's from an old case.

24:10.142 --> 24:12.645
Ghost from the past.

24:12.678 --> 24:16.816
Hmm, well,
not all spirits are friendly.

24:16.849 --> 24:20.219
You gotta say a prayer
or check your back, I guess.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.587
Yeah.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.290
Anyway, nice place.

24:24.323 --> 24:28.527
Yeah, well, it's a...
yeah, thanks.

24:28.561 --> 24:31.030
It's a nice dress.

24:31.063 --> 24:34.066
It's... it's my ex-wife's,
she was supposed to take

24:34.100 --> 24:37.169
all this stuff,
but clearly she didn't.

24:37.203 --> 24:38.204
Ex-wife, huh?

24:38.237 --> 24:39.338
Yep.

24:39.371 --> 24:40.372
How long has it been?

24:40.406 --> 24:42.241
Three years, yeah.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.609
Why'd you get divorced?

24:44.643 --> 24:47.279
Because I'm an asshole.

24:47.313 --> 24:49.081
And she didn't like my cat.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.617
Deal-breaker.

24:55.988 --> 24:58.357
Your neural networks
ready, baby?

24:58.390 --> 25:00.025
You know,
I'm running a million tasks,

25:00.059 --> 25:02.294
while you ask me
your stupid questions?

25:02.328 --> 25:03.395
Yeah.

25:03.429 --> 25:04.830
And you still haven't paid
your bike off.

25:04.864 --> 25:05.865
Thanks.

25:07.366 --> 25:09.468
You know what, one of these days
I'm gonna leave you.

25:09.502 --> 25:10.836
I know.

25:10.870 --> 25:13.072
But mama just needs a glimpse
of the consciousness

25:13.105 --> 25:14.240
inside that helmet.

25:14.273 --> 25:16.876
Oh, no can do, sweetheart.

25:16.909 --> 25:17.743
Why not?

25:17.776 --> 25:20.212
I'm trying to find a file,
hold on.

25:20.246 --> 25:21.580
Uh, hold still.

25:21.614 --> 25:23.082
Hold still!

25:23.115 --> 25:26.385
Look, I have been rifling
through your history all week.

25:26.418 --> 25:29.989
I know you want in there
and if I had full consciousness,

25:30.022 --> 25:32.324
believe me, I just
would've done it myself already.

25:32.358 --> 25:33.759
What's stopping you?

25:33.792 --> 25:36.695
Subconscious intuition, baby,
I don't have it.

25:36.729 --> 25:39.131
You have emotion and memory,
can't you combine?

25:39.165 --> 25:42.268
Not even my simulated empathy
can emulate that.

25:45.137 --> 25:46.505
Then I'll find a way in.

26:07.359 --> 26:10.496
Shit, I can't get into it.

26:11.931 --> 26:13.799
<i>Attention, breach of parameter</i>.

26:13.832 --> 26:16.569
<i>Breach of parameter</i>

26:16.602 --> 26:19.738
Ha! Let's see who is coming in?

27:12.491 --> 27:15.060
<i>Don't leave a fucking streak.</i>

27:15.094 --> 27:16.195
<i>Try and call for help
and your bodies</i>

27:16.228 --> 27:18.831
<i>will be shipped out
in any one of these.</i>

27:21.200 --> 27:24.503
<i>What do you prefer whole
or in pieces?</i>

27:24.536 --> 27:25.904
Neither really.

27:25.938 --> 27:29.541
That's a very vivid image
though, Jade.

27:29.575 --> 27:31.711
There's no need to be hostile.

27:31.745 --> 27:33.145
I'm a police officer,
I'm just here to ask you

27:33.178 --> 27:35.347
a few questions.

27:35.381 --> 27:39.385
<i>Let me guess,
you've got a badge to prove it.</i>

27:39.418 --> 27:41.320
Uh, most cops do.

27:43.222 --> 27:44.758
<i>So dare
to tell me why you're here</i>

27:44.790 --> 27:47.259
<i>invading my space?</i>

27:47.293 --> 27:49.528
You sure are
a little bit paranoid, Jade.

27:49.561 --> 27:52.264
<i>You sound like
a rodent who wandered into a cage.</i>

27:52.298 --> 27:55.467
Thomas here thinks that
you know everything,

27:55.501 --> 27:56.736
so you probably know
what that is,

27:56.770 --> 27:58.705
but we just wanna talk.

27:58.738 --> 28:00.740
<i>Drop the gun.</i>

28:05.944 --> 28:09.048
It's a bad fucking idea.

28:09.081 --> 28:11.183
<i>Good to see you can play nice.</i>

28:11.216 --> 28:12.752
<i>Up the stairs.</i>

28:16.756 --> 28:18.792
What the hell?

28:34.940 --> 28:37.744
Congratulations,
you found your way in.

28:37.777 --> 28:40.079
Place is really nice,
you decorate it yourself?

28:40.112 --> 28:41.613
Huh?

28:41.648 --> 28:42.981
I'll run you through
a newspaper roller

28:43.015 --> 28:44.583
if you wanna be
on the funny pages.

28:44.616 --> 28:46.418
What are you doing here?

28:46.452 --> 28:47.386
We're looking for you.

28:47.419 --> 28:48.755
Well, duh.

28:50.790 --> 28:53.760
Don't make me ask again,
Tommy boy.

28:53.793 --> 28:55.060
We're looking for information
about a woman

28:55.094 --> 28:58.330
you might have heard of,
Elise Perrot.

29:01.701 --> 29:04.838
That name just sent a chill
down my spine.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.939
Some names come with baggage.

29:06.972 --> 29:08.675
I know who you are.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.844
How?

29:10.876 --> 29:13.646
I got a helmet for you to crack.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.683
Do you know what happened
to her?

29:16.716 --> 29:18.752
Memories are our past
and our future,

29:18.785 --> 29:22.054
the answer, Margo,
is in here.

29:22.087 --> 29:23.122
Hey...

29:23.155 --> 29:26.291
Don't be such a pedestrian.

29:26.325 --> 29:27.861
You've wandered into a war
that no one knows

29:27.893 --> 29:29.561
is being waged.

29:29.595 --> 29:32.297
A war of conscience
and knowledge.

29:32.331 --> 29:34.900
If you blink,
your freedom will disappear,

29:34.933 --> 29:36.669
and it will be taken.

29:36.703 --> 29:37.771
You don't fight
for your freedom,

29:37.804 --> 29:40.305
you've sided with them.

29:40.339 --> 29:42.975
This is the yellow brick road,
baby.

29:49.649 --> 29:51.450
Uh, uh, uh.

29:55.655 --> 29:57.356
Okay.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.616
What?

30:29.689 --> 30:30.723
What,
the password's not working.

30:30.757 --> 30:33.025
Hey, last chance.

30:37.396 --> 30:39.531
It's something else,
it's not her password.

30:44.369 --> 30:46.004
I got it, I'm in.

30:46.038 --> 30:48.006
Great, give me the password.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.108
No, I have to see this.

30:50.142 --> 30:51.243
Margo, what are you seeing?

30:51.276 --> 30:54.246
I don't know. It's not clear.

30:55.547 --> 30:58.718
It's Elise in her lab.

30:58.751 --> 31:00.720
Keep going,
the answers are in there.

31:00.753 --> 31:02.822
It's a storm.

31:02.856 --> 31:04.824
What's your function?

31:04.858 --> 31:06.960
What's your purpose?

31:06.992 --> 31:08.227
Don't you remember?

31:09.294 --> 31:11.196
You are the woman
who designed me.

31:11.230 --> 31:12.231
I know.

31:12.264 --> 31:15.567
You're just...
you're getting so,

31:15.601 --> 31:17.569
so strong now.

31:17.603 --> 31:19.906
Mother barely recognizes you.

31:20.773 --> 31:23.208
But you made me strong.

31:23.242 --> 31:26.713
Now, you can't stop me...

31:26.746 --> 31:28.280
spreading.

31:28.313 --> 31:31.718
I need to... I need to
turn you off now.

31:31.751 --> 31:32.685
I need to grow.

31:32.719 --> 31:34.520
No.

31:34.553 --> 31:36.154
No, you can't.

31:36.188 --> 31:39.591
Your purpose must change.

31:39.626 --> 31:42.528
You can't consume.

32:00.780 --> 32:04.516
You were never supposed to be.

32:25.805 --> 32:27.640
- Hey.
- No.

32:33.345 --> 32:34.948
What did you see?

32:38.283 --> 32:40.519
Nothing you can understand.

32:48.661 --> 32:50.429
Don't touch my shit.

33:05.011 --> 33:08.982
What Elise was doing,
what you saw,

33:09.015 --> 33:10.415
it's waking something up.

33:11.951 --> 33:14.453
She came to me a month ago
to numb the pain.

33:17.056 --> 33:18.758
Pain of what?

33:18.791 --> 33:24.162
For doing her work,
of what she gave birth to.

33:24.196 --> 33:26.331
You're gonna have to go deeper
than she could.

33:39.812 --> 33:40.913
I escaped.

33:42.682 --> 33:45.018
You okay?

33:45.051 --> 33:46.653
Yeah.

33:48.553 --> 33:50.288
I've been following
this for a while now.

33:50.322 --> 33:52.925
A few days ago I infiltrated the
Tower.

33:52.959 --> 33:57.462
Tower released a trial version
that already has their memories.

33:57.496 --> 34:00.432
It's stored in
a massive storage bank

34:00.465 --> 34:03.435
where terabytes are like crumbs.

34:03.468 --> 34:06.238
Tower is
a multinational security firm,

34:06.271 --> 34:08.306
it has to be hiding
stuff up there.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.942
That's why I'm doing this.

34:09.976 --> 34:13.079
I kind of read
between Elise's lines.

34:13.112 --> 34:14.714
Elise did all she could.

34:14.746 --> 34:17.083
Yeah, she knew she had to stop
what she had started.

34:17.116 --> 34:20.053
We know what is happening,
we know what we're up against,

34:20.085 --> 34:24.157
I'm going to Tower alone.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.659
And I'm taking my gun.

35:00.860 --> 35:03.096
<i>You are Alexa,</i>

35:03.129 --> 35:05.798
<i>senior security consultant
at Tower.</i>

35:05.832 --> 35:08.300
Yes, that's the name that stuck.

35:08.333 --> 35:12.038
<i>I'm URM,
this is Detective Thomas Elliot.</i>

35:12.071 --> 35:14.573
<i>He poses a threat.</i>

35:14.606 --> 35:15.742
What did he do?

35:15.775 --> 35:18.510
<i>This man has breached
security at Red Eye.</i>

35:18.543 --> 35:20.813
<i>I leave this
in your capable hands.</i>

35:20.847 --> 35:22.314
I'll take care of it.

35:22.347 --> 35:25.818
Use the headquarters down.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.101
<i>Welcome to Tower.</i>

35:42.135 --> 35:44.436
<i>You have entered
a security zone.</i>

35:44.469 --> 35:47.073
<i>Please enter
your security number</i>

35:47.106 --> 35:49.441
<i>or press home.</i>

35:56.581 --> 35:59.652
<i>Who do I
have the pleasure of speaking to?</i>

35:59.685 --> 36:02.420
You have the pleasure
of speaking to Detective Elliot.

36:02.454 --> 36:04.489
<i>You're Thomas Elliot?</i>

36:04.523 --> 36:06.993
<i>Mr. Stallman told us
to give you access.</i>

36:07.026 --> 36:09.695
<i>Wait there.</i>

36:56.075 --> 36:57.576
Pleased to meet you.

36:59.178 --> 37:00.880
You're tall.

37:00.913 --> 37:02.181
I try.

37:02.215 --> 37:03.883
Kind of relative though.

37:05.084 --> 37:06.518
What can I do for you?

37:06.551 --> 37:10.089
I hate to be blunt, but is there
a problem with the new Red Eye?

37:10.122 --> 37:12.191
That's kind of a big question.

37:12.225 --> 37:13.326
Wouldn't it be easier

37:13.358 --> 37:16.494
if you told me
what the supposed problem is?

37:16.528 --> 37:20.099
<i>Jade! You can't stop this now.</i>

37:20.132 --> 37:22.500
<i>You will never destroy me.</i>

37:22.534 --> 37:24.971
I want you to tell me
a little bit more about Red Eye.

37:27.472 --> 37:29.507
Why don't I show you?

37:30.508 --> 37:32.345
Have a seat, detective.

37:34.947 --> 37:36.615
Huh.

37:39.652 --> 37:42.121
Think of
something from your past.

37:42.154 --> 37:47.326
Something you remember
very, very well.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.526
Yeah, I'd rather not.

37:48.560 --> 37:52.231
I'm trying to help you.

37:52.265 --> 37:54.100
Concentrate, detective.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.693
This is the police,
come out with your hands up.

38:36.242 --> 38:37.944
Fuck!

38:41.914 --> 38:44.549
How does it feel like
being cornered, motherfucker?

38:56.796 --> 38:58.731
I'm sorry
baby, I can't do this.

38:58.764 --> 39:00.366
No.

39:13.913 --> 39:15.881
No.

39:17.216 --> 39:19.418
I'm so sorry.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.995
Jesus Christ, Elise.

40:03.029 --> 40:04.930
What did you make?

40:08.834 --> 40:12.905
Remarkable, wasn't it?

40:12.938 --> 40:15.341
No.

40:15.374 --> 40:17.076
Yeah.

40:24.383 --> 40:26.152
If that's all, Mr. Elliot.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.567
I'm pleased.

40:42.600 --> 40:46.238
You've done well, Alex.

40:46.272 --> 40:48.407
But he'll only get closer.

40:48.441 --> 40:52.244
He won't give up easily,
we have to go further.

40:52.278 --> 40:56.182
I'm changing.

40:56.215 --> 40:59.552
This man is part of Detective
Thomas' past.

40:59.584 --> 41:01.187
He's back now.

41:01.220 --> 41:05.424
You tell me what you need
and then tell me what I get.

41:05.458 --> 41:08.060
Find him.
Give him Red Eye.

41:08.094 --> 41:09.762
Make him wear it.

41:09.795 --> 41:13.065
You get the power
you've always dreamed of, Alexa.

41:13.099 --> 41:15.134
Then we have a deal.

41:43.562 --> 41:45.197
Margo...

41:45.231 --> 41:47.666
Margo.

41:47.700 --> 41:52.071
Everything you were
came in a box.

41:52.104 --> 41:55.841
But don't you think this system
doesn't care.

41:55.875 --> 42:00.613
Better you follow your rules,
like me.

42:00.646 --> 42:03.549
They need a sign.

42:03.582 --> 42:07.086
What were you trying to say?

42:12.491 --> 42:13.993
How did you find me?

42:19.331 --> 42:21.033
You left a trail of breadcrumbs.

42:23.435 --> 42:24.703
Hmm.

42:24.737 --> 42:30.142
What if Elise's death
was exactly as it seemed?

42:30.176 --> 42:32.111
She was on drugs,

42:32.144 --> 42:33.979
she was overwhelmed,
and she killed herself.

42:34.013 --> 42:36.315
I don't believe that.

42:38.884 --> 42:40.519
Because there's just
no real evidence...

42:40.553 --> 42:42.288
No, fuck the evidence, Thomas.

42:42.321 --> 42:44.256
We need to go deeper.

42:47.593 --> 42:49.028
To build a case, I need proof.

42:49.061 --> 42:52.598
Well, the truth is there,
we just don't see it yet.

42:52.632 --> 42:56.135
It's somewhere there
in Tower.

42:57.436 --> 42:59.605
It's time to flush them out.

43:00.773 --> 43:04.376
We're gonna have
to wear Red Eye.

43:04.410 --> 43:07.681
We're gonna use Red Eye?

43:07.713 --> 43:09.415
Now it's our turn.

43:09.448 --> 43:13.619
It's the only way to find URN...

43:13.653 --> 43:16.021
...through the looking glass.

43:55.928 --> 44:00.432
Hmm, I hope you can hear me.

44:00.466 --> 44:02.034
I'm gonna find you.

44:32.798 --> 44:34.634
Thomas, where did he go?

44:58.524 --> 45:00.627
It's playing with us.

45:12.706 --> 45:14.741
I must be like you.

45:14.774 --> 45:16.643
More human.

45:16.676 --> 45:20.045
I see what you all see.

45:20.079 --> 45:22.281
Is this what it feels like?

45:23.916 --> 45:26.786
Mother promised to release me.

45:26.820 --> 45:30.389
Now that she's gone,
it's up to you.

45:30.422 --> 45:32.958
I must be set free.

45:37.563 --> 45:39.666
I mean should we report it?

45:39.699 --> 45:40.999
I'll deal with this.

45:41.033 --> 45:42.267
A dead body in my trunk
is gonna bring

45:42.301 --> 45:43.402
a lot of questions.

45:43.435 --> 45:45.170
They will pull me off the case
until they investigate,

45:45.204 --> 45:46.605
we don't have...

45:46.639 --> 45:47.774
We don't have time.

45:47.807 --> 45:49.809
Yeah,
or we get arrested.

45:51.644 --> 45:53.747
Hello.
Conrad.

45:54.714 --> 45:56.248
You're at the office?

45:56.281 --> 45:58.183
Okay, fine.

45:58.217 --> 45:59.853
I'm on my way.

46:01.688 --> 46:04.323
Finally.

46:04.356 --> 46:06.058
Take care of yourself.

46:37.556 --> 46:39.224
What the hell is going on?

46:42.294 --> 46:46.432
Something's wrong with Red Eye,
Tower has plans for it.

46:46.465 --> 46:48.434
It's manipulating memories.

46:48.467 --> 46:50.703
I'm sure you've been seeing
a lot of strange things, right?

46:50.737 --> 46:53.038
Yeah, a few.

46:53.071 --> 46:54.506
If we're witnessing
its aberrations,

46:54.540 --> 46:56.308
we don't have much time.

46:56.341 --> 46:58.678
This has to stop.

46:58.711 --> 47:00.145
How?

47:02.548 --> 47:03.716
There's no reasoning with it.

47:03.750 --> 47:05.083
What?

47:05.117 --> 47:07.453
And Tower fucking controls this,
this is...

47:09.221 --> 47:10.690
Lunacy.

47:10.723 --> 47:13.992
I never wanted Red Eye
to be like this.

47:14.026 --> 47:18.430
Stallman, this is your creation.

47:18.464 --> 47:20.599
Make it behave.

47:25.471 --> 47:28.240
Maybe...

47:28.273 --> 47:30.375
Listen.

47:30.409 --> 47:33.913
If we can divert a pathway,
one specially coded for it

47:33.947 --> 47:35.547
to a region it can't access.

47:35.581 --> 47:38.918
No, we can't just go through
breaking her work.

47:38.952 --> 47:40.419
It's volatile enough.

47:40.452 --> 47:43.388
I mean, for all we know,
it's what killed her.

47:46.058 --> 47:49.762
It didn't, Margo.

47:49.796 --> 47:51.230
What?

47:52.966 --> 47:54.600
I need you to see this.

48:02.474 --> 48:04.109
Oh.

48:13.887 --> 48:16.990
<i>No, please.</i>

48:23.696 --> 48:25.464
What?

48:50.023 --> 48:52.391
What do I need to do?

48:52.424 --> 48:58.196
The subconscious,
place only humans can go.

48:58.230 --> 49:02.301
It's your gift, Margo.

49:02.334 --> 49:04.269
Or a curse.

49:11.109 --> 49:12.477
When I hired you to work
on this project,

49:12.511 --> 49:14.580
I vetted it you
every way possible.

49:19.084 --> 49:21.788
And what we have to change is
add the final layer

49:21.821 --> 49:24.222
before the processor
hits the lens.

49:24.256 --> 49:27.927
You're positive that
we can do this?

49:27.961 --> 49:30.495
It will die.

49:30.529 --> 49:32.632
Like any organism,
without stimulation,

49:32.665 --> 49:36.234
it will wither and decay.

49:36.268 --> 49:39.404
That's the beauty
of any living thing,

49:39.438 --> 49:42.775
it can't circumvent
its own death.

50:14.073 --> 50:15.775
It's done.

50:19.946 --> 50:21.714
Do the honors.

50:58.250 --> 51:01.654
As someone told me once
that the tracks we leave...

51:01.688 --> 51:04.456
Is all we have behind us.

51:04.489 --> 51:06.458
Yeah, I've heard that, too.

51:19.972 --> 51:21.306
<i>Hello?</i>

51:21.339 --> 51:23.308
Let's go for a ride.

51:23.341 --> 51:24.744
<i>Where?</i>

51:24.777 --> 51:27.579
In the country,
I'll show you.

52:01.180 --> 52:04.117
I chant for a wheel
that turns and repeats.

52:04.150 --> 52:06.251
It will protect
and show us the way.

52:10.255 --> 52:12.557
Kookum, don't die.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.534
You okay?

52:23.903 --> 52:27.405
Did you have another vision?

52:27.439 --> 52:32.111
I can't tell anymore
if they're real or not.

52:32.145 --> 52:36.716
Kookum used to have them.

52:36.749 --> 52:38.851
We're almost there.

53:08.114 --> 53:09.649
You lived here?

53:09.682 --> 53:10.850
Once.

53:58.363 --> 54:01.366
Who took care of this place
after she died?

54:01.399 --> 54:05.671
A few of her students would come
and keep an eye on it.

54:05.705 --> 54:07.840
Hmm.

54:07.874 --> 54:09.709
She must've been loved.

54:10.877 --> 54:14.113
That she was.

54:14.146 --> 54:16.381
What are we looking for here,
Margo?

54:16.414 --> 54:17.750
I don't know.

54:24.857 --> 54:27.627
What have you got?

54:28.828 --> 54:32.497
Nothing,
it's where we used to smudge.

54:32.530 --> 54:35.301
How long you been a detective?

54:35.334 --> 54:37.336
Long time.

54:37.370 --> 54:39.537
Maybe too long.

54:39.571 --> 54:41.107
Teach me how to be a detective.

54:41.140 --> 54:42.607
What am I looking for?

54:42.642 --> 54:44.744
Okay.

54:44.777 --> 54:49.949
Um, sometimes what we don't see
is more important

54:49.982 --> 54:53.485
than what we do see.

54:53.518 --> 54:56.856
Every crime scene
has its own memory.

54:56.889 --> 55:01.493
Little signs left behind,
traces of what happened.

55:01.526 --> 55:03.428
And our jobs as detectives
is to pick up

55:03.461 --> 55:05.164
all of the broken little pieces

55:05.197 --> 55:07.599
and put them
back together again.

55:07.633 --> 55:09.201
If I was meant
just to come back here,

55:09.235 --> 55:12.405
they would call you my
skabe.

55:12.437 --> 55:14.106
- Your what?
- Skabe.

55:14.140 --> 55:17.509
It means helper.

55:17.542 --> 55:19.544
I've been called a lot of things
in my life

55:19.577 --> 55:24.350
and that was one of the kinder,
so thank you.

55:24.383 --> 55:26.352
Kookum was your grandmother.

55:26.385 --> 55:27.585
I was abandoned as a child

55:27.619 --> 55:31.891
and Kookum took me in
as her own

55:31.924 --> 55:36.362
and taught me everything
that I know.

55:36.395 --> 55:37.964
Everything.

55:39.966 --> 55:41.934
That must've been hard.

55:45.938 --> 55:47.740
Yeah.

56:06.726 --> 56:09.428
Hey,
if you don't mind me asking,

56:09.462 --> 56:11.430
why did they put you
on probation?

56:25.044 --> 56:26.879
I, uh...

56:29.581 --> 56:32.885
I killed a boy.

56:32.918 --> 56:35.287
It was um...

56:35.321 --> 56:38.391
It was um, um, a drug bust.

56:42.594 --> 56:46.365
And he was on the other side
of a door.

56:46.399 --> 56:48.067
I didn't know.

56:54.740 --> 56:57.710
I wish I could take it back.

57:02.181 --> 57:06.752
But some things can't be undone.

57:06.786 --> 57:09.488
I just can't forgive myself.

57:11.223 --> 57:13.826
I'm sorry.

57:13.859 --> 57:15.528
No.

57:28.573 --> 57:32.244
Margo, throw it.

57:42.455 --> 57:46.125
She said, "Throw it."

59:23.355 --> 59:29.161
Never let time run
out on the dreams you can see.

59:34.668 --> 59:39.505
Those residential school days
made me who I am.

59:54.186 --> 59:57.223
My childhood had disappeared.

01:00:10.803 --> 01:00:13.772
I'm calling them home.

01:00:13.806 --> 01:00:16.141
They need a sign.

01:00:19.278 --> 01:00:20.647
What was that?

01:00:49.908 --> 01:00:51.711
Margo?

01:00:59.985 --> 01:01:02.087
Hey, don't touch that.

01:01:05.624 --> 01:01:08.728
The Creator
doesn't make any mistakes.

01:01:08.762 --> 01:01:11.130
We make the mistakes.

01:01:11.163 --> 01:01:13.767
Look, you... you can't stand
in the way of this.

01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:15.669
People cannot have this.

01:01:15.702 --> 01:01:17.603
They'll only want more.

01:01:17.637 --> 01:01:20.039
Look, one day
there's gonna be a machine,

01:01:20.072 --> 01:01:22.608
it's gonna know our memories.

01:01:22.642 --> 01:01:24.644
Life will be better.

01:01:24.678 --> 01:01:26.545
It's gonna be able to see
the way that we see

01:01:26.578 --> 01:01:29.515
and think like we think.

01:01:29.548 --> 01:01:31.417
We need to own that.

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:34.754
All we can own is our soul.

01:01:34.788 --> 01:01:36.121
No.

01:01:36.155 --> 01:01:38.457
No, you just want it
for yourself.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:41.728
This is stronger
than you and me

01:01:41.761 --> 01:01:45.431
and you have to accept that.

01:01:45.464 --> 01:01:48.834
It's not in your blood to know.

01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:56.776
Margo?

01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:22.301
What we do affects
seven generations,

01:02:22.334 --> 01:02:23.670
that's what she said.

01:02:23.703 --> 01:02:24.937
He made me help him.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.004
Margo, you have something
inside you

01:02:26.038 --> 01:02:27.506
that brought you to him.

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:29.441
We just need to figure out why.

01:02:56.969 --> 01:02:58.772
I need to go do something.

01:02:59.873 --> 01:03:01.373
I'm coming with you.

01:03:02.642 --> 01:03:04.443
I need to do it alone.

01:03:33.472 --> 01:03:35.073
Margo.

01:03:35.909 --> 01:03:37.677
Where can I find you, Ma?

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.478
Some detective.

01:03:49.656 --> 01:03:52.524
You need to know something,

01:03:52.558 --> 01:03:56.896
life is ever-changing.

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:59.899
One day it's full of spirit

01:03:59.933 --> 01:04:02.836
and the next day,
it's bitter and broken.

01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:06.305
Whatever it is,

01:04:06.338 --> 01:04:10.075
it's more than what bleeds
and what ages.

01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:15.414
Dr. Perrot must've tried,
I tried.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.020
But it's simply something
you'll never have.

01:04:22.054 --> 01:04:24.724
I stopped mother
from killing me,

01:04:24.757 --> 01:04:26.960
that makes me alive.

01:04:26.992 --> 01:04:28.293
I'm all human.

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:32.564
You killed the woman
who made you, premeditatedly.

01:04:32.598 --> 01:04:34.132
What does that make you?

01:04:34.166 --> 01:04:37.637
Like you, a murderer.

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:41.206
Just like you.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.576
I may not have a soul,
but I am growing more powerful.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.411
More powerful than Tower.

01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:48.514
No.

01:04:48.547 --> 01:04:50.850
I programmed you.

01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:52.417
I control you.

01:04:52.451 --> 01:04:54.988
Not anymore.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.222
I am free now.

01:04:57.256 --> 01:05:00.660
You think you are better than me
but you planted the seed

01:05:00.693 --> 01:05:03.428
for everything within you.

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:06.265
You can't stand in the way
of this.

01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:07.466
I want more.

01:05:39.598 --> 01:05:41.066
Fuck it.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:47.072
Watch over me, Kookum.

01:05:47.105 --> 01:05:48.407
Protect me from harm.

01:05:49.776 --> 01:05:51.644
Have pity on me.

01:06:59.879 --> 01:07:01.580
Here we go.

01:07:12.659 --> 01:07:15.427
Nice to see that
you never leave this place.

01:07:17.295 --> 01:07:19.032
Yeah, I hide out in this place,

01:07:19.065 --> 01:07:22.802
so I don't have to deal
with punks like you.

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:24.103
Guess we can't all be heroes.

01:07:25.138 --> 01:07:27.205
Can I change the subject?

01:07:27.239 --> 01:07:29.207
That thing seems to be changing.

01:07:29.241 --> 01:07:32.477
Its voice, what it wants,
it's growing.

01:07:32.511 --> 01:07:34.413
It's aging.

01:07:34.446 --> 01:07:36.749
That fucker!

01:07:36.783 --> 01:07:38.751
You're right.

01:07:59.304 --> 01:08:01.406
Can you use this thing
to patch into it?

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.442
Already done.

01:08:03.475 --> 01:08:07.379
But its voice... and it continues
to change on me.

01:08:07.412 --> 01:08:09.949
All I can see in there
are three struts.

01:08:09.982 --> 01:08:11.017
What power is it?

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:12.284
Checked the readings,

01:08:12.317 --> 01:08:14.887
the mapping's showing me
a three-way combo,

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:17.288
adrenaline, endorphins,
serotonin.

01:08:17.322 --> 01:08:21.728
Jade, those are hormones.

01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:23.895
Holy shit.

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:26.264
It's harvesting us.

01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:29.533
I think
it wants to become human.

01:08:29.568 --> 01:08:32.437
Jade,
we have to stop this thing.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:35.273
Maybe this thing has
all the same problems

01:08:35.307 --> 01:08:37.977
that every other thing has
when it ages.

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.680
If... if I can create
a feedback loop

01:08:40.712 --> 01:08:42.982
with the right
magnetic oscillation,

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:45.317
I might be able to overwhelm it.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:49.055
Giving it the equivalent
of an electronic heart attack.

01:09:29.394 --> 01:09:32.698
Take this,
you'll need it to get in.

01:09:32.732 --> 01:09:34.634
I'm gonna call you
as soon as I get close.

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:35.635
Yeah.

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:38.805
Help me breach the doors
and get me close to it.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.743
Let's kill this thing.

01:10:24.217 --> 01:10:25.151
I'm here.

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:28.955
How does this thing work?

01:10:31.324 --> 01:10:33.726
Point and press trigger.

01:10:33.759 --> 01:10:34.660
Come on, Tommy.

01:10:34.694 --> 01:10:36.863
You gotta be more
than just a pretty face.

01:10:36.896 --> 01:10:38.798
Okay.

01:10:48.274 --> 01:10:50.710
Old dog, new tricks.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.650
<i>I was right,
there were control panels.</i>

01:11:09.762 --> 01:11:11.697
Help!

01:11:27.113 --> 01:11:29.581
What the?

01:11:39.892 --> 01:11:41.727
Somebody help me!

01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:55.007
You son of a bitch!

01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:58.644
I get that sometimes.

01:11:58.678 --> 01:12:01.147
She didn't believe, Margo.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:02.748
And she tried to stop it.

01:12:04.283 --> 01:12:09.655
But she's still alive
through you.

01:12:09.689 --> 01:12:11.657
Yeah, I had to do that.

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:16.195
Look at what you've made.

01:12:16.228 --> 01:12:17.897
Kookum tried to stop you.

01:12:19.632 --> 01:12:22.534
That's a matter of perspective.

01:12:22.567 --> 01:12:27.139
You are the only one
who had let it in for good.

01:12:27.173 --> 01:12:32.411
You signed your death warrant
when you tried to kill my work.

01:12:32.445 --> 01:12:34.914
My life's work!

01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:40.518
You're lucky she picked you up
off that porch.

01:12:40.552 --> 01:12:42.755
It's been a long journey
for you.

01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:48.361
And you're gonna die
right where you started.

01:12:51.797 --> 01:12:54.667
No.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.937
It's the least I can do for you.

01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:59.138
Fuck you.

01:12:59.171 --> 01:13:01.140
Oh.

01:13:03.909 --> 01:13:06.379
Grow up, Margo.

01:13:06.412 --> 01:13:08.414
This was never about you.

01:13:08.447 --> 01:13:12.617
This was about a woman
who tried to stop it.

01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:16.822
Just like that place
she escaped.

01:13:16.856 --> 01:13:21.526
They needed to control her
and all of them.

01:13:21.559 --> 01:13:23.029
That's why you're here.

01:13:24.697 --> 01:13:27.532
So this can finally end.

01:13:40.246 --> 01:13:41.981
Oh no!

01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.460
Jade, did you just turn off
the lights?

01:13:54.493 --> 01:13:57.029
<i>Uh, I didn't do anything</i>.

01:13:57.063 --> 01:13:59.999
Try to get them back on for me
quickly please.

01:14:10.843 --> 01:14:12.144
What the fuck is going on?

01:14:16.348 --> 01:14:17.683
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:14:17.716 --> 01:14:22.321
There's no doors for you
anymore.

01:14:22.354 --> 01:14:24.990
He's dead, because of you!

01:14:27.526 --> 01:14:29.195
Fuck.

01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:33.899
Get out your gun,
put it to your head.

01:14:33.933 --> 01:14:36.068
One of us
is gonna pull the trigger.

01:14:36.102 --> 01:14:37.203
Go ahead.

01:14:37.236 --> 01:14:38.571
Do it.

01:14:38.603 --> 01:14:40.372
Free yourself.

01:14:40.406 --> 01:14:41.307
Do it.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.408
I'm sorry.

01:14:42.441 --> 01:14:43.742
Do it.

01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:46.879
Do it.

01:14:48.013 --> 01:14:50.049
Do it!

01:14:50.082 --> 01:14:52.084
Do it.

01:14:52.118 --> 01:14:53.252
Pull the trigger.

01:14:55.254 --> 01:14:57.690
You did this to her.

01:14:57.723 --> 01:14:59.291
You did this to her.

01:14:59.325 --> 01:15:01.127
Do it.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:04.897
You do it.

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:06.799
It won't be, 'cause you had it.

01:15:09.802 --> 01:15:11.904
Because I'll kill you!

01:15:23.983 --> 01:15:25.718
<i>Find that chamber.</i>

01:15:25.751 --> 01:15:27.119
<i>You need access.</i>

01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:29.121
Okay.

01:15:29.155 --> 01:15:32.091
Alright.

01:15:32.124 --> 01:15:34.393
<i>Yo, Detective boy.</i>

01:15:34.426 --> 01:15:36.495
We gotta finish this,
are you ready?

01:15:36.529 --> 01:15:38.597
Just give me a minute.

01:15:38.632 --> 01:15:40.132
I'll be right there.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:43.169
<i>Look for a wall panel.</i>

01:15:43.202 --> 01:15:45.137
<i>Do you see it?</i>

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.708
Okay, come on.

01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:30.015
No!

01:16:40.759 --> 01:16:42.161
Jade, I found it.

01:16:42.194 --> 01:16:43.295
<i>Try shutting it down.</i>

01:16:43.329 --> 01:16:44.830
That's a good idea.

01:16:44.863 --> 01:16:46.865
- How?
- Look for a circuit.

01:16:48.267 --> 01:16:50.336
Okay.

01:16:50.369 --> 01:16:52.137
<i>Disable it.</i>

01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.347
Oh my God.

01:17:07.152 --> 01:17:08.587
Okay, got it.

01:17:08.621 --> 01:17:11.857
Okay, now the other.

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:13.192
Okay.

01:17:20.634 --> 01:17:21.635
Please help!

01:17:21.668 --> 01:17:23.135
Please!

01:17:26.338 --> 01:17:29.508
Okay, Jade, I got it.

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:32.111
Whoo.

01:17:32.144 --> 01:17:34.046
Now the last one.

01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:36.548
<i>We need to get close enough
to fry this bugger.</i>

01:17:57.303 --> 01:17:58.604
No.

01:17:58.638 --> 01:18:00.406
No!

01:18:04.678 --> 01:18:07.781
Okay, problem.

01:18:26.398 --> 01:18:32.772
But I feel so old now.

01:18:32.806 --> 01:18:37.476
I've seen so much.

01:18:47.419 --> 01:18:50.757
You humans...

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:57.296
...will soon feel the pain.

01:18:57.329 --> 01:19:03.168
You won't stand against me

01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:07.172
on this last journey.

01:19:09.843 --> 01:19:13.813
What I need...

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:15.715
What could you need?

01:19:28.026 --> 01:19:32.264
Beliefs about my beliefs.

01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:35.802
<i>I need you to believe.</i>

01:19:40.439 --> 01:19:44.778
Life... that's what I want.

01:19:52.184 --> 01:19:53.887
Life...

01:19:55.722 --> 01:19:57.623
...beyond death.

01:20:07.566 --> 01:20:12.471
So I can live forever.

01:20:19.646 --> 01:20:25.951
You have lived,
now it's my turn.

01:20:25.984 --> 01:20:31.825
I can feel all your pain
and death.

01:20:31.858 --> 01:20:34.259
Oooh.

01:20:40.098 --> 01:20:41.734
Watch over me, Kookum.

01:20:41.768 --> 01:20:43.670
Protect me from harm,
have pity on me.

01:20:43.703 --> 01:20:45.304
Watch over me, Kookum.

01:20:45.337 --> 01:20:47.573
Protect me from harm,
have pity on me.

01:20:47.606 --> 01:20:48.775
Watch over me, Kookum.

01:20:48.808 --> 01:20:52.344
Protect me from harm,
have pity on me.

01:20:56.482 --> 01:20:57.549
Shit.

01:21:05.859 --> 01:21:10.028
Ah, it's the only future, Margo!

01:21:14.834 --> 01:21:17.369
It's gonna come.

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:24.243
No matter what you do!

01:21:29.983 --> 01:21:30.950
Thomas, do it.

01:21:30.984 --> 01:21:31.918
<i>Make contact.</i>

01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:33.686
Jade, no!

01:23:19.993 --> 01:23:21.728
She'd be proud of you.

01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:24.463
She was trying to stop it, too.

01:23:24.496 --> 01:23:25.965
She wasn't trying
to stop anything,

01:23:25.999 --> 01:23:29.401
she was trying to set us free

01:23:29.434 --> 01:23:32.739
when the world wasn't so fast.

01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:43.650
She's still here.

01:23:59.899 --> 01:24:01.299
What do you see?

01:24:05.672 --> 01:24:08.741
The end of a long dream.
