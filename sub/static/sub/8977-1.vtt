00:28.517 --> 00:31.142
(singing)Well, I left New York 1949.

00:31.183 --> 00:35.225
(To)go across the country (wi)thout a dad-blame dime.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.600
Montana in the cold, cold fall.

00:38.642 --> 00:42.642
Found my father in the gambling hall.

00:44.433 --> 00:46.767
Father, Father where have you been?

00:48.017 --> 00:51.142
Been out here in the world since I was 10.

00:52.475 --> 00:56.933
Dear son, he said don't worry about me.

00:56.975 --> 01:00.017
I'm about to die of pleurisy.

01:02.767 --> 01:09.267
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara, home I'll never be.

01:09.308 --> 01:16.933
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

01:16.975 --> 01:22.767
For better or worse, through thick and thin.

01:22.808 --> 01:26.933
Like being married to the little woman.

01:28.975 --> 01:32.892
God loved me just like I loved him.

01:34.975 --> 01:37.600
Wants you to do just the same for him.

01:40.407 --> 01:42.725
Well, the worms eat away but don't worry, watch thewind.

01:42.767 --> 01:46.433
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

01:46.475 --> 01:51.225
So I left Montana in an ol'freight train.

01:51.266 --> 01:55.850
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

01:55.891 --> 02:03.516
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

02:03.558 --> 02:11.808
Rode to Oklahoma, rode to El Cajon Rode to Tehachapi, rode to San Antone.

02:11.850 --> 02:22.308
Home I'll never be Home I'll never be Home I'll never be.

02:34.725 --> 02:36.183
ON THE ROAD

02:46.725 --> 02:47.725
Got room for one more?

02:47.766 --> 02:49.016
Yeah, sure, hop in.

02:49.058 --> 02:50.141
There's room for everybody.

02:50.141 --> 02:53.016
Alright.

02:55.100 --> 02:55.850
Thanks, brother !

02:58.350 --> 02:59.058
Whooooee !

02:59.100 --> 03:00.433
Here we go !

03:00.475 --> 03:01.891
Hang on, brother, hang on.

03:05.475 --> 03:06.433
Where you guys from?

03:06.475 --> 03:07.808
North Dakota.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.183
We're headed for the harvest.

03:10.891 --> 03:11.558
Thanks.

03:20.850 --> 03:21.558
What about you?

03:23.183 --> 03:24.058
Montana.

03:24.100 --> 03:29.391
So, you going someplace, or you just going?

03:31.350 --> 03:32.558
I guess I'm just going.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.558
You got any money?

03:35.683 --> 03:38.516
I got enough for a pint of whiskey till we reach Denver.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.933
You reckon if we put them things in the ground, something will grow up?

03:50.850 --> 03:52.641
(laughs)If I get hungry enough, I plan to eat them raw !

03:54.433 --> 03:55.600
(laughs)I'll share them with you !

03:55.600 --> 03:57.225
Aww.

04:12.183 --> 04:15.641
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl.

04:15.683 --> 04:18.766
She's sweet sixteen.

04:18.808 --> 04:22.933
She's the prettiest little thing.

04:22.975 --> 04:25.058
You ever seen.

04:29.183 --> 04:30.641
I got a pretty little girl.

04:30.683 --> 04:33.891
She's sweet sixteen.

04:33.933 --> 04:38.433
She's the prettiest little thing.

04:38.475 --> 04:40.308
You ever seen.

04:40.350 --> 04:54.891
(All join)Oh I got a pretty little girl. She's sweet sixteen. She's the prettiest little thing I ever seen.

05:13.224 --> 05:15.141
Five months earlier.

05:16.558 --> 05:18.599
Leo Paradise loved many things.

05:20.599 --> 05:22.933
Though part of him never left his native Quebec, when.

05:22.974 --> 05:28.058
he moved to this country with his dear wife Gabrielle, heloved it with all his heart.

05:30.849 --> 05:36.016
Now, he joins his departed son Gerard in a better place.

05:36.058 --> 05:37.058
Are you all right?

05:38.474 --> 05:39.262
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

05:39.262 --> 05:40.691
I'm all right.

05:40.691 --> 05:41.224
I'm good.

06:09.599 --> 06:12.433
I first met Dean not long after my father died.

06:14.391 --> 06:17.503
I'd just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about

06:17.504 --> 06:20.934
except that it really had something to do with my father's death,

06:20.935 --> 06:22.846
and my awful feeling that everything was dead.

06:39.349 --> 06:40.599
"Let's go for a drink", says my buddy Sal.

06:40.641 --> 06:44.349
But I show up and guess what â€” no Sal Paradise.

06:44.391 --> 06:49.016
A boring, brooding mute has been inserted in his place.

06:49.058 --> 06:50.183
Oh really, Carlo.

06:50.224 --> 06:51.808
Well, what's there to talk about exactly?

06:51.849 --> 06:53.766
The book I'm not writing?

06:53.808 --> 06:55.099
The inspiration I don't feel?

06:55.141 --> 06:57.558
Even the beer's flat.

06:57.599 --> 06:59.183
I mean, look around, man.

06:59.183 --> 07:00.433
Everything's stultified.

07:00.474 --> 07:02.391
True, but these are temporary worries.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.808
Life is long and wondrous and strange.

07:04.849 --> 07:06.849
Look at me, Sal.

07:06.891 --> 07:07.933
I'm full of inspiration.

07:07.974 --> 07:11.474
My mind is a veritable echo chamber of epiphanies.

07:11.516 --> 07:15.641
Dig it "The air is dark.

07:15.683 --> 07:18.974
The night is sad...

07:19.891 --> 07:21.391
I'll get you another beer !

07:21.433 --> 07:23.349
Bravo, very nice, Carlo !

07:23.391 --> 07:23.849
Chad.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.058
I've been looking all over town for you hoodlums.

07:26.099 --> 07:26.766
How you doing, man?

07:26.808 --> 07:27.724
Listen, remember that thing?

07:27.766 --> 07:30.349
Jailbird friend of mine from Denver?

07:30.391 --> 07:31.641
The one that stole 500 cars?

07:31.683 --> 07:33.558
The one I've been raving about?

07:33.599 --> 07:36.683
He didn't think we really believed that, did he?

07:36.724 --> 07:39.136
First reports of Dean came to me through Chad King,

07:39.137 --> 07:41.503
who'd shown me and Carlo a few letters from him,

07:41.504 --> 07:43.832
writtenfrom a Colorado reform school.

07:44.016 --> 07:45.724
Come on man, let's go !

07:45.766 --> 07:47.224
The great Dean awaits !

07:50.933 --> 07:52.349
Dean had arrived in New York.

07:52.391 --> 07:56.474
He'd just married a 16- year-old chick named Marylou.

07:56.558 --> 07:57.266
New York, 1947.

07:59.016 --> 07:59.766
Come on, gentlemen.

07:59.808 --> 08:00.183
One more.

08:20.891 --> 08:24.224
Well, now, look who's at my doorstep, old Chad King !

08:26.266 --> 08:27.266
How's it going, cowboy?

08:27.308 --> 08:27.891
I'm Sal.

08:27.933 --> 08:28.641
Sal.

08:28.683 --> 08:30.433
Strong grip.

08:30.474 --> 08:32.390
Yes, yes, yes !

08:32.433 --> 08:34.433
Sal and Carlo, the writer pals.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.890
I've heard all about you gone cats.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.349
We're going to orient you into the Nietzschean ways of the big bad city.

08:40.390 --> 08:42.140
And smoke your weed, of course.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.557
Well, yes, we got plenty of that !

08:43.599 --> 08:46.891
Marylou, why don't you get on the ball and make us some coffee?

08:46.932 --> 08:49.891
My writer friends are here Come on in.

08:49.891 --> 08:50.641
Hey hey !

08:50.641 --> 08:52.432
Take your shoes off.

08:52.516 --> 08:53.432
Yeah?

08:53.516 --> 08:54.182
No, I'm just kidding.

08:57.891 --> 09:02.786
(singing) Cry to hear folks chatter

09:05.496 --> 09:09.455
And I know you cheat

09:10.727 --> 09:14.063
Right or wrong don't matter

09:15.448 --> 09:16.011
When you're with me, sweet...

09:16.807 --> 09:17.391
Yes...

09:17.432 --> 09:18.849
You'll never get this one.

09:19.591 --> 09:20.397
(singing)Yipra (and continues)

09:25.873 --> 09:26.686
That's not a song.

09:31.724 --> 09:32.432
Yipra (etc.

09:34.432 --> 09:35.182
Slim Gaillard

09:35.932 --> 09:37.432
Yes, yes, yes !

09:37.474 --> 09:38.224
Slim it is.

09:38.266 --> 09:38.849
Dean.

09:38.891 --> 09:41.682
Some of us need the occasional doughnut to survive

09:41.682 --> 09:42.807
Ah, "the occasional doughnut".

09:42.849 --> 09:44.724
I just love this gal !

09:45.682 --> 09:46.391
Yipra !

09:51.891 --> 09:53.807
And wake up, Chad King.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.266
Thanks.

10:01.724 --> 10:03.641
It's nice to have someone paying attention.

10:15.141 --> 10:16.724
I mean, it's really nice having someone pay attention !

10:18.474 --> 10:20.474
You know, I never met a girl before who could roll tea.

10:20.474 --> 10:21.599
Oh yeah?

10:21.641 --> 10:23.016
Yipra...

10:29.891 --> 10:30.891
My friend !

10:32.641 --> 10:33.516
(Book title) Swann's Way

10:54.474 --> 11:01.224
The day before my father died, he took hold of my hand and he looked at it.

11:01.266 --> 11:07.391
And he said, "You got no calluses, Sal.

11:07.391 --> 11:11.516
That's because you don't do any real fucking work, boy !

11:11.557 --> 11:12.849
"Oh, yeah?

11:16.599 --> 11:17.599
Yeah.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.641
My old man's still lost.

11:24.682 --> 11:28.266
Just wandering the hobo streets of Denver like...

11:28.307 --> 11:30.766
like shit.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.849
To the old men

11:43.432 --> 11:44.224
Yeah.

11:44.266 --> 11:52.266
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

11:52.307 --> 11:54.682
And to the West.

12:30.224 --> 12:31.474
There you go

12:49.224 --> 12:54.182
It wasn't only because I was a writer and needed new experiences that I wanted to know Dean more.

12:54.224 --> 12:58.390
But because somehow he reminded me of some long lost brother.

12:58.432 --> 13:05.807
In the West, he'd spent a third of his time in the pool hall, a third in jail, and a third in the public library.

13:14.307 --> 13:20.307
All my New York friends were giving their tired, bookish political or psychoanalytical reasons for being in the negative.

13:20.349 --> 13:22.307
But Dean just raced in society.

13:22.349 --> 13:25.932
I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me.

13:37.849 --> 13:39.557
Oh yeah

13:48.724 --> 13:51.182
Here's a cat who can really bend his girl, man !

14:41.640 --> 14:43.932
Do you even know what we witnessed right there, Sal?

14:43.974 --> 14:45.890
That tenor-man has it.

14:45.932 --> 14:55.432
You see, he starts with the first chorus, then lines up his ideas, rises through his fate, and then suddenly, somewhere in the middle of the chorus, he gets it.

14:55.474 --> 14:58.099
Everybody looks up and knows.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.599
Time stops.

14:59.599 --> 15:05.253
He has to blow across bridges and come back with such infinite feeling for the tune of the moment,

15:05.254 --> 15:08.340
that everyone knows that it's not the tune that counts, but it.

15:11.932 --> 15:14.640
"It-man", can I buy you that drink?

15:14.682 --> 15:17.765
Make that three.

15:19.057 --> 15:20.099
I'll buy you one.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.807
Alright.

15:21.807 --> 15:25.099
Thanks What's your name, man?

15:28.182 --> 15:29.724
(laughs)They want to know my name !

15:49.807 --> 15:51.348
There's some boys from work.

15:51.390 --> 15:53.890
Hi, boys from work.

15:53.932 --> 15:54.973
Howdy.

15:55.015 --> 15:58.223
So, where was I?...

15:58.265 --> 16:00.432
So there's this whore house.

16:00.473 --> 16:02.932
There's this monkey at the door.

16:02.973 --> 16:04.807
So you...

16:04.807 --> 16:09.932
you place your bet in the cage, you know, and the monkey rolls the cage around, and the dice roll out...

16:10.015 --> 16:14.765
And if you win, you get the girl for free.

16:14.807 --> 16:21.348
But if you loose to that monkey, you gonna get your backside "bitched" !

16:22.723 --> 16:23.640
By the monkey !

16:23.682 --> 16:25.307
Now that's an evolution.

16:25.307 --> 16:26.765
"Sodom andGorilla".

16:26.807 --> 16:29.140
I ain't telling no lie !

16:31.348 --> 16:32.057
That's cool.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.348
So what is it like being with a white woman?

16:38.390 --> 16:40.932
I always wondered.

16:42.557 --> 16:43.640
I'd say it's like...

16:43.682 --> 16:47.223
You never been with a white woman before?

16:47.223 --> 16:50.432
(No...) Been with a white man.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.640
Ozone Park, Queens.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.723
Come in, man.

16:57.765 --> 16:58.848
Memere !

16:59.098 --> 17:00.598
C'est l'bon gars que j'tai parle.

17:01.598 --> 17:02.932
Le chum a Chad, de Denver.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.265
Howdy'do, Ma !

17:04.307 --> 17:05.098
Hello.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.057
You look just like her.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.057
Come on, man.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.973
Where's Marylou?

17:10.973 --> 17:11.807
Oh, man.

17:11.807 --> 17:14.932
We get into a big ruckus, so she calls the cops on me.

17:14.973 --> 17:18.015
Then she whores a few bucks together and heads back to Denver.

17:18.057 --> 17:19.015
Whoa, really?

17:19.057 --> 17:19.848
Yeah.

17:21.098 --> 17:22.973
You know, I'm planning on heading back, too.

17:23.015 --> 17:24.348
When?

17:24.390 --> 17:25.598
You know, soon.

17:25.640 --> 17:29.932
Anyways, before I go, I absolutely have to learn how to write from you.

17:29.973 --> 17:31.932
Well, I'm honored, man, but I...

17:31.973 --> 17:32.598
Show me how !

17:32.598 --> 17:33.640
Alright?

17:33.640 --> 17:34.765
I want to learn.

17:34.807 --> 17:35.848
Teach me.

17:48.723 --> 17:49.557
Alright, then.

17:49.598 --> 17:51.765
Alright, let's see.

18:01.015 --> 18:03.307
"The cowboy thinks I'm some kind of genius.

18:03.348 --> 18:04.723
He's leaning over my shoulder right now.

18:09.057 --> 18:11.265
We gotta forget the Western stuff.

18:11.265 --> 18:14.015
Turn ourselves into the Eastern jazz.

18:14.015 --> 18:15.057
What about.

18:15.057 --> 18:15.432
Hey.

18:25.307 --> 18:28.265
I was walking down 125th street and suddenly I stopped.

18:30.015 --> 18:31.265
I looked at everything in amazement.

18:31.307 --> 18:35.456
It was like I'd just woken up from a dream that had lasted my whole life,

18:35.457 --> 18:39.584
and I realized that God isn't somewhere out there in Heaven, he's right here.

18:39.682 --> 18:40.682
Yes.

18:40.723 --> 18:41.765
In the dirt.

18:41.765 --> 18:43.223
He's an ape like us.

18:43.265 --> 18:44.598
Buh.

18:52.057 --> 18:56.348
And I shambled after as usual, as I have done my whole life, after the people that interested me.

18:56.390 --> 18:59.890
'Cause the only people that interest me are the mad ones.

18:59.932 --> 19:13.223
The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn and say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like Roman candles across the night.

19:25.056 --> 19:27.931
BUS TRAFFIC ANNOUNCEMENT
... service from Albany and Poughkeepsie...

19:27.973 --> 19:32.140
is now arriving at door number 3...

19:30.848 --> 19:31.348
Come on.

19:31.390 --> 19:32.265
Yes, Ma'am.

19:33.765 --> 19:35.098
Where did you get the suit?

19:35.181 --> 19:36.973
11 dollars on 3rd av'.

19:37.015 --> 19:38.765
Come on, guys, concentrate.

19:47.765 --> 19:48.348
Let's see.

19:53.265 --> 19:54.306
For you.

19:56.973 --> 19:58.431
And I'll keep this one.

19:58.473 --> 20:03.681
Sal, Sal, Sal

20:03.681 --> 20:04.640
I'll miss you guys.

20:08.890 --> 20:09.848
To the West-orooni !

20:09.890 --> 20:11.098
To the West-orooni.

20:15.473 --> 20:16.515
Don't forget to write, Carlo.

20:16.556 --> 20:17.848
Don't do anything I wouldn't do !

20:17.848 --> 20:22.473
I will.

21:23.931 --> 21:25.390
Alas, alas, Sal.

21:25.390 --> 21:27.181
It's not me, I'm drunk.

21:27.223 --> 21:33.848
But my soul talking direct soul language, so to speak, to my deepest blood brother and holy goofâ€”that's you.

21:33.931 --> 21:39.931
And to be formal and analytical about it, let me objectify the characteristics I miss the most of you.

21:39.973 --> 21:42.140
Number 1 your conversation.

21:42.181 --> 21:46.056
Number 2 your brotherly smile, man.

21:46.098 --> 21:52.056
But I shall go on, so to close and get the gist Denver waits for you.

21:52.098 --> 21:58.015
Carlo in his damp grotto and clowned misery â€”to use a paradox of expressionâ€” waits for you, so get on it !

21:58.056 --> 22:01.348
Be quick and hurry to me, no delay.

22:01.348 --> 22:02.431
Long dash.

22:03.848 --> 22:05.348
Bring Paradise to Denver.

22:08.015 --> 22:09.265
Bring Paradise to Denver.

22:09.348 --> 22:11.890
And I love you as ever.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.181
Dean.

22:14.598 --> 22:15.348
Drunk.

22:40.390 --> 22:45.973
With the coming of Dean Moriarty, began the part of my life you could call "My life on the Road".

22:47.375 --> 22:52.473
Before that, I'd often dreamed of going West â€”always vaguely planning but never cutting out.

22:56.681 --> 22:59.098
I was a young writer, trying to take off.

23:32.098 --> 23:34.348
43 W80 C degrees in Clarion...

23:52.598 --> 23:54.389
Dawson County, Nebraska.

23:56.139 --> 23:57.431
Now what species are you?

23:58.514 --> 23:59.306
Traveler.

24:00.848 --> 24:01.889
I appreciate the lift.

24:03.931 --> 24:05.139
... It might be your last !

24:05.139 --> 24:07.306
I'm freighting dynamite.

24:14.806 --> 24:15.931
You looking for that toe?

24:15.931 --> 24:18.764
They amputated it this morning.

24:20.639 --> 24:23.598
You can't smoke, but you can drink in this car.

24:23.639 --> 24:25.931
Alright Thanks.

24:28.598 --> 24:30.431
"Follow me, I'm right behind you.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.556
" Did it hurt?

24:35.598 --> 24:38.098
I don't recommend it !

24:54.764 --> 24:56.389
voice of (low) Shoot I gotta take me a piss.

24:56.431 --> 25:00.848
A truck with a flat board at the back with about six or seven boys sprawled out on it.

25:00.889 --> 25:02.473
Piss call.

25:02.514 --> 25:05.348
Woo-ee !

25:05.431 --> 25:06.181
Here we go !

25:06.181 --> 25:07.931
-yelled the kid in the baseball cap.

25:07.931 --> 25:10.973
We been riding this son of a bitch since Des Moines !

25:11.014 --> 25:12.764
These guys never stop!

25:12.806 --> 25:19.806
Every now and then you have to yell for piss call, otherwise you have to piss off the air and hang on brother, hang on!

25:26.389 --> 25:28.181
Denver, Colorado

25:30.723 --> 25:31.431
Thanks a lot, guys

25:38.514 --> 25:40.723
N IN THE STREET (low) I know, it's.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.681
I hope you're not paying rent on this place !

25:59.889 --> 26:01.931
(laughs)Oh, my angel-headed Sal is here at last !

26:03.014 --> 26:04.098
Good to see you.

26:04.139 --> 26:04.931
You, too.

26:04.973 --> 26:07.306
So, what are you doing?

26:07.348 --> 26:07.931
I mean.

26:09.556 --> 26:10.764
What exactly are you doing?

26:10.806 --> 26:14.931
I am vacuuming at May Company by day.

26:14.931 --> 26:15.889
Uhmm...

26:15.889 --> 26:16.722
Impressive.

26:16.722 --> 26:17.389
... I know.

26:17.431 --> 26:21.139
And chasing our beloved, feral, mad dog by night.

26:21.181 --> 26:22.514
And where is Dean?

26:22.556 --> 26:22.931
What's the schedule?

26:22.931 --> 26:25.514
So, I got off work a half hour ago.

26:25.597 --> 26:28.389
At that time, Dean is screwing Marylou at the hotel.

26:28.431 --> 26:32.181
At one sharp, he goes from Marylou to Camille, the new girl.

26:32.181 --> 26:37.639
Of course, neither knows what's going on, but he screws her once, giving me time to arrive at 130.

26:37.681 --> 26:41.764
Then we go out for our unfinished business until 6 in the morning.

26:41.806 --> 26:43.972
"Unfinished business"?

26:44.972 --> 26:50.347
Dean and I are trying to communicate with absolute honesty and completeness everything in our minds.

26:50.389 --> 26:52.056
We do it on Benzedrine.

26:52.097 --> 26:55.276
And then at 6, he goes back to Marylou and spends the rest of the day

26:55.277 --> 26:57.651
running around trying to sort out the necessary papers for the divorce.

26:57.806 --> 27:01.389
All that he wants to do is go back to San Francisco and marry Camille.

27:01.389 --> 27:03.014
It's sick !

27:03.097 --> 27:05.222
And I bet she's incredibly ugly.

27:06.264 --> 27:08.347
Like Helen of Troy with a fucking brain.

27:12.264 --> 27:12.889
What are you doing?

27:12.889 --> 27:14.806
(whispers)Camille really hates me right now.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.556
Why, Sal !

27:22.722 --> 27:23.806
(laughs)Yes, you've arrived !

27:23.847 --> 27:26.931
You finally got on that old road, didn't you?

27:26.972 --> 27:27.764
I did.

27:31.056 --> 27:34.139
Look here, Camille, it's my good buddy Sal from New York.

27:35.222 --> 27:39.056
Sorry for not getting up, Sal, but I wasn't expecting company at this hour.

27:39.097 --> 27:40.014
I'm sorry.

27:40.056 --> 27:40.847
I should leave.

27:40.889 --> 27:46.847
It's Sal's first time in Denver and I think it's absolutely necessary for me to take him out and fix him up with a girl.

27:46.847 --> 27:47.806
Right now?

27:47.847 --> 27:51.931
I should be back no later than 314 for our hour of reverie, darling.

27:51.972 --> 27:54.097
Works all day, runs around all night.

27:54.181 --> 27:55.847
He never eats, he never sleeps...

27:55.847 --> 27:56.764
Ain't she something?

27:56.764 --> 27:57.889
The man thinks he's Superman.

27:57.931 --> 27:58.847
Yeah.

27:58.889 --> 28:01.306
As I said, not 3 but 314.

28:01.306 --> 28:05.931
Now are we straight in the most wonderful and deepest depths of our soul, dear darling?

28:08.847 --> 28:10.222
Is he offering me a choice?

28:10.264 --> 28:12.514
I don't think he's offering you a choice, no.

28:16.431 --> 28:17.264
Hee-hee !

28:17.306 --> 28:18.972
Yes.

28:25.139 --> 28:26.514
You look like a smart guy.

28:27.597 --> 28:30.347
I bet you're wondering what he sees in me, huh?

28:32.347 --> 28:33.556
Respectability?

28:34.931 --> 28:35.889
Very good.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.306
I'm impressed.

28:39.097 --> 28:40.597
Let's go to work, babies.

28:40.639 --> 28:44.264
So now that you're sleeping with half of Denver, are there any girls left for me?

28:44.306 --> 28:46.097
Well now listen here, Sal.

28:46.139 --> 28:49.556
I know a girl named Rita and Rita cannot wait to meet you.

28:49.556 --> 28:51.222
We'll go there at once !

28:51.222 --> 28:52.389
I thought we were going to talk.

28:52.431 --> 28:53.889
Yes, yes, after.

28:53.889 --> 28:56.681
If you want to know my true nature, at this moment?

28:56.722 --> 28:59.889
I'm one of those people who goes around showing his cock to juvenile delinquents.

28:59.889 --> 29:03.139
(Sal laughs)Oh, these Denver doldrums...

29:03.181 --> 29:06.181
Isn't he the finest, smartest fellow in the world?

29:21.139 --> 29:22.014
You know that old guy?

29:23.556 --> 29:24.847
I thought it was my pops.

29:26.764 --> 29:28.056
Carlo, wait up !

29:32.306 --> 29:33.181
Voila.

29:42.305 --> 29:42.972
Darling.

29:43.972 --> 29:46.305
Bless me father, for I will sin.

29:52.597 --> 29:54.014
Yum, yum, yum

30:00.055 --> 30:01.305
It's nice to have you boys.

30:06.514 --> 30:07.722
What's so funny, my boy?

30:09.930 --> 30:11.014
I'm checking my pulse.

30:13.139 --> 30:14.305
Round two-sie, here we go !

30:18.472 --> 30:19.430
It happens.

30:20.305 --> 30:21.222
My hands...

30:24.264 --> 30:24.972
Mine does.

30:45.430 --> 31:13.722
I was filled with guilt.

31:14.805 --> 31:16.597
I thought he said she was my girl.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.722
Nothing for you or me, Sal.

31:20.930 --> 31:24.097
Everything and everyone for that faithless bitch !

31:26.805 --> 31:28.305
Guess who I hear !

31:29.347 --> 31:33.014
Carlo, come on.

31:33.055 --> 31:33.639
No.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.097
Come on.

31:34.097 --> 31:34.305
No.

31:34.347 --> 31:34.930
Come on.

31:35.014 --> 31:35.430
No.

31:35.472 --> 31:35.930
Come on.

31:36.014 --> 31:37.347
No no no no no

31:37.347 --> 31:39.472
Sal No No.

31:39.514 --> 31:40.389
Sal Argh .

31:43.555 --> 31:45.472
Rebop Sal, come on.

31:45.514 --> 31:48.222
Yeah-oh...

31:49.014 --> 31:50.139
No clothes party.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.055
You enjoying?

32:05.097 --> 32:08.722
Yeah, but now I'm finishing up my degree here in Denver.

32:08.764 --> 32:11.972
Dean told me you do, uh, set design...

32:12.014 --> 32:13.555
Set design, yeah.

32:13.597 --> 32:14.680
That's interesting.

32:14.680 --> 32:18.555
The one I enjoyed most designing was, uh, "Desire Under the Elms".

32:18.597 --> 32:19.764
It's a great play.

32:19.805 --> 32:20.639
Yeah.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.097
Eugene O'Neill.

32:22.139 --> 32:24.764
Yeah, I know it's Eugene O'Neill, Carlo.

32:24.805 --> 32:25.680
Thank you.

32:25.722 --> 32:29.555
There's like a rusty nail scratching across my goddam spinal cord.

32:30.597 --> 32:32.639
Dean, "I've got the world on a string"?

32:32.805 --> 32:34.014
Yes, you do.

33:02.264 --> 33:02.847
Come on !

33:02.889 --> 33:07.305
Don't tell me you New York intellectuals don't dance

33:08.097 --> 33:14.472
(Ella Fitzgerald) I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow.

33:14.513 --> 33:16.805
Got the string...

33:20.680 --> 33:29.597
around my finger... Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love...

33:36.097 --> 33:37.222
You didn't say you had a nice voice.

33:37.263 --> 33:39.055
I don't have a nice voice.

33:39.097 --> 33:40.055
Yeah.

33:40.097 --> 33:41.597
Yeah, you do.

33:43.180 --> 33:43.972
Thanks.

33:46.055 --> 33:47.805
Are you staying in Denver very long?

33:54.180 --> 33:55.722
I got the feeling I won't be staying very long.

33:55.763 --> 33:57.888
Yeah.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.638
"Not enough hours in the day.

34:01.555 --> 34:02.513
"Right.

34:06.430 --> 34:07.388
then.

34:07.430 --> 34:10.097
singing along.

34:10.179 --> 34:12.972
What a world, what a life, I'm in love...

34:21.304 --> 34:25.176
(reading)"Assuming for yourself the sorrow of my body

34:25.177 --> 34:28.591
Thus, when you solace me in my desire

34:28.592 --> 34:32.966
I held your body, and lay beside it sleeping

34:33.538 --> 34:35.887
Feeling the pain of your own inward fire"

34:36.888 --> 34:39.179
"Weeping myself to hear your silent weeping" .

34:45.472 --> 34:46.472
Has Dean read this?

34:48.347 --> 34:53.472
I've gotten so crazy over Dean that all his stupid friends call me "Carlo in Wonderland".

34:53.513 --> 34:55.304
Clever, huh?

34:55.347 --> 34:56.388
Ah, yes...

34:56.429 --> 35:02.680
They don't understand this is the first time actual sex has been...

35:02.722 --> 35:05.847
part of my relationship with a man.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.180
This is how you love.

35:13.222 --> 35:15.180
I'm not in fucking wonderland.

35:15.222 --> 35:16.680
I know it's not a man he wants.

35:16.722 --> 35:19.847
I even told him we can take sexuality out of it, just...

35:23.597 --> 35:24.638
"Be with me, man.

35:27.305 --> 35:28.263
Hold me.

35:30.555 --> 35:31.597
Just call me."

35:31.638 --> 35:37.722
And he always promises, "Yes, Carlo, yes, man - I'll call you.

35:37.722 --> 35:38.763
I'll call you."

35:38.763 --> 35:40.763
Who the fuck am I kidding?

35:40.847 --> 35:45.138
I can't even call what I feel "a heartache", it's too banal.

35:45.180 --> 35:47.263
"Melancholy" is too languorous.

35:47.305 --> 35:51.930
"Grief" is closest.

35:55.472 --> 35:56.305
I'm 21.

35:56.305 --> 35:59.597
By the time I'm 23 I'm going to write one great poem.

35:59.597 --> 36:01.847
Then it's all over for me.

36:07.347 --> 36:09.847
Sal, I'm leaving.

36:12.722 --> 36:13.472
I'm going to Africa.

36:13.513 --> 36:15.472
A la Rimbaud, non?

36:15.513 --> 36:17.763
I might jump ship at Dakar.

36:17.763 --> 36:19.722
I'm gonna smoke opium.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.805
And I will pick up dark, mysterious men.

36:25.847 --> 36:28.180
And they will love me.

36:40.305 --> 36:41.763
I really wish I could drink whiskey like a man.

36:44.930 --> 36:48.555
I know those guys are like, "Hey, do a shot !"

37:01.055 --> 37:07.471
Home in Missoula, Home in Truckee, Home in Opelousas, Ain't no home for me.

37:07.513 --> 37:15.433
Home in Ol'Medora, Home in Wounded Knee, Home in Ogallala, Home I'll never be.

37:44.805 --> 37:45.513
Excuse me, miss.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.013
I can't seem to find an empty seat anywhere.

37:48.055 --> 37:50.346
May I?

37:51.346 --> 37:52.680
If you wish.

38:04.888 --> 38:05.471
I'm Sal.

38:07.805 --> 38:08.305
Terry.

38:20.430 --> 38:21.513
Selma, California.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.096
No tienes hambre?

39:28.013 --> 39:29.305
Que pasa Papa?

39:51.555 --> 39:52.555
You want to love me now?

40:37.513 --> 40:39.096
Cesar 1,20.

40:42.763 --> 40:45.304
Matilde 1,10.

40:48.679 --> 40:50.554
Terry 1,15.

40:54.971 --> 40:55.846
Terry.

40:56.804 --> 40:58.763
Sal 1,05.

40:59.721 --> 41:00.679
Sal.

41:04.304 --> 41:06.346
Maria 1,15.

41:06.388 --> 41:08.388
You growing roots?

41:13.971 --> 41:16.138
Jasmine 1,10.

41:23.763 --> 41:27.554
The harvest is ending, and it's getting much colder in the nights.

41:27.596 --> 41:31.096
Terry and I bitterly decided we'd have to leave.

41:32.638 --> 41:38.013
She was supposed to come to New York in a month with her brother, but we both knew she wouldn't make it.

41:38.096 --> 41:43.554
I can feel the pull of my own life calling me back.

41:45.054 --> 41:46.096
I still have a book to write.

41:57.846 --> 41:59.846
(very low)We screw one more time, then you leave...

42:09.429 --> 42:10.263
See you in New York, Terry !

43:20.221 --> 43:21.096
Wait.

43:29.346 --> 43:30.013
Thanks.

43:34.846 --> 43:36.179
You know what they did to me in that prison?

43:36.221 --> 43:39.054
Solitary confinement, and a Bible.

43:39.096 --> 43:41.637
I used it to sit on the stone floor.

43:41.679 --> 43:45.147
But when they seen that I did that, they took away that Bible,

43:45.148 --> 43:49.498
and they brought back a little pocket size one, like so big, and I couldn't sit on it.

43:50.304 --> 43:53.221
You know why I been in prison my whole life?

43:53.221 --> 43:58.887
When I was 13 years old, I was in a movie with a boy, and he makes a crack about my mother.

43:58.929 --> 44:01.137
You know, that dirty word.

44:01.137 --> 44:04.596
So I take out my jackknife and I cut up his throat.

44:04.637 --> 44:07.429
I would have killed him if they hadn't drug me off.

44:07.429 --> 44:13.387
The judge says "Henry, you know what you were doing when you attacked your friend?

44:13.429 --> 44:16.304
" I say, "Yes sir, YourHonor, I want to kill that son-of-a-bitch.

44:18.596 --> 44:19.304
" And I still do.

44:34.721 --> 44:35.637
Bah !

44:35.679 --> 44:37.679
J'suis revenu rien qu'd'un morceau, memere !

44:37.721 --> 44:39.262
Penses-tu qu'fa m'fait quelqu'chose ?

44:42.596 --> 44:43.762
Vieille sorciere !

44:55.721 --> 44:57.596
It was over a year before I saw Dean again.

45:01.471 --> 45:06.346
I stayed home most of the time, struggling with a half- finished manuscript on my desk.

45:08.804 --> 45:10.429
Bored with all of it.

45:14.221 --> 45:20.060
RECORD SONG I used to love you But it's all over All over now.

45:22.429 --> 45:23.471
Sal's sister's house, North Carolina, December 1948.

45:23.929 --> 45:27.679
Ma, on behalf of Nin and I, I just wanted to say that.

45:27.721 --> 45:33.346
"ton gateau est fantastique !"

45:33.387 --> 45:36.012
Thank you Hey, eh, eh.

45:36.054 --> 45:42.679
Listen to this General Douglas MacArthur bans kissing on the streets of Tokyo.

45:42.721 --> 45:45.679
Who does that puritanical old fart think he is?

45:45.721 --> 45:47.304
Sal.

45:57.012 --> 46:00.721
Ho, ho, ho Oh hello, merry, merryâ€¦

46:01.512 --> 46:03.429
Dean, I'll be goddamned !

46:03.471 --> 46:04.179
You're early...

46:04.221 --> 46:04.971
Yeah, well...

46:05.012 --> 46:06.512
Shit Who's in the car?

46:06.554 --> 46:09.762
Oh, it's Marylou and my good pal Ed Dunkel.

46:09.762 --> 46:12.971
Anyways we need a place to clean up immediately.

46:12.971 --> 46:14.096
Man, we're dog tired.

46:14.179 --> 46:14.971
Sure.

46:15.012 --> 46:16.137
How did you get here so fast?

46:16.179 --> 46:17.429
That Hudson goes !

46:17.471 --> 46:18.596
Yeah?

46:18.637 --> 46:19.971
Where did you get it?

46:19.971 --> 46:21.971
I bought it out of my savings.

46:22.012 --> 46:26.262
I was working as a breakman on the Southern Pacificmaking 400 bucks a month.

46:26.304 --> 46:27.429
And guess what?

46:29.179 --> 46:30.179
I'm a father now !

46:31.054 --> 46:31.929
What?

46:31.971 --> 46:33.471
You and Marylou?

46:33.471 --> 46:34.679
No, not Marylou.

46:34.679 --> 46:35.512
Camille !

46:35.554 --> 46:38.929
I annuled Marylou, hitched up with Camille, and now we have a sweet little Amy.

46:38.971 --> 46:41.471
And a nice little pad in 'Frisco.

46:41.512 --> 46:46.054
But as God as my witness, Marylou is the only honey- cunt I'll ever adore.

46:46.096 --> 46:48.887
That makes perfect sense.

46:52.512 --> 46:53.179
Dunkee !

46:54.637 --> 46:55.596
Dig this, Sal.

46:55.637 --> 46:58.762
Crazy Cat gets married and dumps his wife off in Tucson !

46:58.804 --> 47:00.721
Come in, come in.

47:03.346 --> 47:04.637
Holy shit.

47:04.679 --> 47:06.346
We really appreciate this, man.

47:06.346 --> 47:08.429
There's no heater in that California car.

47:08.471 --> 47:11.095
We haven't eaten in 30 hours.

47:11.137 --> 47:12.679
Or slept in a bed since...

47:12.720 --> 47:13.637
Denver?

47:13.679 --> 47:15.012
We don't have a penny, one.

47:15.012 --> 47:16.804
Good times on the Dean Express, huh?

47:17.887 --> 47:20.012
Well, there's lots of food inside for everybody.

47:20.054 --> 47:21.012
Oh great, thanks.

47:22.554 --> 47:23.679
Look at all them books.

47:26.512 --> 47:27.095
Hi.

47:27.095 --> 47:27.679
Hey.

47:29.470 --> 47:30.554
How are you Marylou?

47:30.595 --> 47:31.929
I'm fine.

47:33.679 --> 47:36.095
But I gotta tell you how nice it is to see a sane face.

47:36.137 --> 47:40.679
Well, uh, sane is a very relative term around here, kid.

47:40.720 --> 47:44.012
Don't call me that anymore, because that bastard aged me.

47:44.054 --> 47:46.220
Isn't that a great game to grab ass !

47:46.262 --> 47:50.054
If you want food, it's on the left.

47:56.512 --> 47:57.304
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

47:59.554 --> 48:05.364
Ma, to repay your gregarious hospitalities and all the trimmings on this fine day of holiday giving,

48:05.365 --> 48:09.756
I will drive you and Sal up to old mad New York so you won't have to pay for a train.

48:12.429 --> 48:13.554
How about that, Ma?

48:17.679 --> 48:18.679
Ok...

48:23.095 --> 48:23.804
S.
sorry.

48:36.929 --> 48:39.137
You don't know that feeling, man.

48:43.387 --> 48:44.804
I stole a .

48:44.845 --> 48:50.720
38 and I sat in the car, gun on my temple for 14 hours, Sal, trying to pull the trigger and I couldn't do.

48:53.304 --> 48:54.595
And I'm sweating.

48:54.637 --> 48:56.762
And I'm nauseous.

48:56.804 --> 48:59.220
And Camille finds me this way, and I beg her to do it.

48:59.262 --> 49:00.970
To kill me.

49:02.387 --> 49:03.679
And she couldn't, man.

49:08.595 --> 49:10.012
I don't know what's wrong with me.

49:10.054 --> 49:14.845
I do all these dumb things and I think in all these distorted ways, you know, I'm burning up.

49:20.929 --> 49:24.095
I'm scared I'm gonna lose all the wisdom I ever learned, Sal.

49:28.429 --> 49:35.845
You know, I see a girl and I just, ... you know, I just tremble all over and I get lost !

49:35.887 --> 49:38.554
Like a couple weeks ago.

49:38.595 --> 49:40.595
I meet this black boy, right?

49:40.637 --> 49:46.804
He's 25 and he's staying with his sugar mama, and we're digging some great music and we're getting high.

49:46.845 --> 49:49.054
And then I meet the greatest gone gal, Suzie, right.

49:49.095 --> 49:50.304
Oh, Suzie !

49:50.345 --> 49:52.762
And I swear she's a virgin.

49:52.804 --> 49:57.368
So I take her back to the black boy's place and 3 hours later she's getting a little drunk,

49:57.369 --> 49:59.282
and the greatest show in the world starts, you know.

49:59.970 --> 50:01.262
And she does this dance for us.

50:01.304 --> 50:06.141
She takes off her panties, she leaves on her dress, and she stands on her head and she does the splits,

50:06.142 --> 50:08.549
you know, and she's screaming the whole time "I want your cock !"

50:09.012 --> 50:10.679
right, "I need your cock !"

50:10.720 --> 50:13.715
And she goes over next to the bed and she spreads the black boy's knees open

50:13.716 --> 50:17.882
and pulls out his big black beauty and starts chugging on that, going on that thing, really going at it.

50:18.387 --> 50:23.179
Spreads the black girl's knees open and starts going down on her big black hairy muff, you know.

50:23.220 --> 50:26.595
Getson the bed and does a whole other miraculous splits, you know.

50:26.637 --> 50:28.929
Comes over to me, swallows me up.

50:28.970 --> 50:31.304
Grabs the black boy's ears, pulls him down on her.

50:31.345 --> 50:35.054
Black girl grabs me and its a goddam four-way orgy, Sal.

50:35.095 --> 50:37.387
Goes on for four fucking hours.

50:43.470 --> 50:44.553
God And I missed this?

50:46.637 --> 50:47.553
Yeah.

50:54.095 --> 50:54.970
Yeah.

51:12.970 --> 51:14.553
It's good to have family, isn't it?

51:42.053 --> 51:43.262
Goddammit !

51:43.262 --> 51:46.776
You see, one day that little kid's gonna throw a rock through a guy's fucking windshield

51:46.777 --> 51:49.495
and he's going to crash and die all on account of that little piss-pants?

51:50.428 --> 51:51.178
See what I mean?

51:51.220 --> 51:52.845
God exists without qualms.

52:05.512 --> 52:06.470
South Hill, Virginia.

52:09.428 --> 52:12.053
<i>Coming up next Mike Sullivan covers the weather for your......</i>

52:17.887 --> 52:19.428
<i>going to be up for some low...</i>

52:25.470 --> 52:26.012
Stop.

52:35.012 --> 52:35.887
Que c'est qu'il fait ?

52:37.137 --> 52:37.803
Hein ?

52:37.845 --> 52:39.512
Comme dit le President Truman .

52:39.595 --> 52:42.137
"We have to cut down on the cost of living."

52:52.637 --> 52:54.178
Whooooaooo !

52:54.220 --> 52:58.720
Man, oh, man, we must absolutely findsome time for kicks in New York !

53:00.428 --> 53:01.887
Carlo's back from Africa.

53:01.928 --> 53:05.137
We all get to see Carlo first thing in the morning, darlings.

53:18.762 --> 53:22.178
Lady, you shouldn't let your son drive that fast in these conditions.

53:23.595 --> 53:25.678
You're in my state, you slow down.

53:30.303 --> 53:31.762
I'll pay you back every cent, Ma.

53:31.803 --> 53:34.970
Oh, you're fucked now, Dean.

53:42.220 --> 53:47.637
But all I'm saying in the sincerities of my soul is that I miss you, darling, and I'll be right back in those arms.

53:47.678 --> 53:50.012
(over the phone) Look, I got your postcard from Denver.

53:50.053 --> 53:51.428
Do you think I'm an idiot?

53:51.470 --> 53:52.803
I know Denver means Marylou.

53:52.845 --> 53:54.178
Marylou who?

53:56.387 --> 53:57.512
Come on, Sweet Cakes.

53:57.553 --> 53:59.303
You know there are certainties our minds can grasp.

53:59.345 --> 54:00.845
(over the phone) Oh shut up!

54:00.887 --> 54:02.095
I never want you back!

54:02.137 --> 54:03.262
Don't you dare come back here!

54:03.303 --> 54:04.345
Ever!

54:23.928 --> 54:30.595
This is the new and complete Dean, grown to his own definition of maturity.

54:30.636 --> 54:34.761
I say to myself, "My God, he's changed!

54:34.761 --> 54:38.345
" Fury spits out of his eyes when he tells of things he hates.

54:38.386 --> 54:41.970
Great glows of joy replace this when suddenly he gets happy.

54:42.011 --> 54:45.053
Every muscle lives to twitch and go.

54:46.761 --> 54:47.345
Sal

54:52.053 --> 54:52.720
Yeah?

54:52.720 --> 54:53.928
Phone for you.

54:53.970 --> 54:54.678
Thanks.

54:57.095 --> 54:57.720
Hello?

54:57.761 --> 54:59.511
(over the phone)Sal Paradise?

54:59.553 --> 55:01.511
Bull calling you from New Orleans.

55:01.511 --> 55:02.511
Bull Lee?

55:02.553 --> 55:03.345
How the hell are you?

55:03.386 --> 55:08.011
Well, we have ourselves a situation that needs immediate rectifying.

55:08.011 --> 55:11.553
I've got a girl down here just showed up on my doorstep.

55:11.553 --> 55:18.845
This Galatea Dunkel is looking for some clown named Ed Dunkel, and I don't know who the hell these people are.

55:18.928 --> 55:22.178
Uh, Galatea and Ed are friends of Dean's from Denver.

55:22.220 --> 55:24.095
Oh, shit Dean ...

55:26.553 --> 55:29.011
Well, she wants to talk to you.

55:29.053 --> 55:31.136
Make it fast, would you?

55:31.178 --> 55:34.095
The telephone cartels don't do this for free.

55:38.053 --> 55:39.511
Hello, its Galatea.

55:39.511 --> 55:40.970
Is Ed there?

55:41.011 --> 55:44.011
Uh, Ed's fine, but he's sleeping.

55:44.011 --> 55:47.220
Well, would you please tell him to come and get me.

55:48.303 --> 55:52.011
Mr. Lee and his wife don't seem all that happy to have me around.

55:52.053 --> 55:56.053
And I should kill Ed for what he did to me, dumping me here like this !

55:56.095 --> 55:59.761
And he's simply got to come and get me as soon as he can !

55:59.803 --> 56:04.553
He's got to help me, these people are mad They're mad!

56:04.595 --> 56:06.553
Well, we'll be there right after New Years.

56:15.720 --> 56:16.595
Thank you.

56:16.636 --> 56:18.053
Mmm hmm.

56:21.095 --> 56:21.928
(singing) Dynamite!

56:26.803 --> 56:27.595
Look at that !

56:27.595 --> 56:28.803
Oh my !

56:53.761 --> 56:54.970
I'm telling you, she's cross-eyed.

56:55.011 --> 56:56.053
She's not looking at you, it's me.

56:56.095 --> 57:02.470
I was twenty days at sea in the doldrums, uh, when I decided to kill myself.

57:02.511 --> 57:06.720
And I realized that shit, I haven't written a fucking suicide note !

57:06.761 --> 57:10.013
I'm going over, you know, searching my mind for the right words,

57:10.014 --> 57:14.151
and then I saw all of the crew coming out onto the deck,

57:14.152 --> 57:15.837
and I couldn't jump anymore.

57:16.261 --> 57:20.678
But, in that moment, I resolved to follow my heart.

57:20.678 --> 57:22.345
To live.

57:22.386 --> 57:23.303
Yeah.

57:23.345 --> 57:25.470
To experience the wisdom of life,

57:25.470 --> 57:26.011
Yes.

57:26.053 --> 57:31.428
mad with ecstasy and vengeance and truth.

57:31.428 --> 57:35.803
I'm glad I did, because otherwise I would have missed out on this amazing pot.

57:37.511 --> 57:38.261
So !

57:38.303 --> 57:44.136
On that, on that note, everybody move their feet like you feel something, like you're alive !

57:45.053 --> 57:45.969
Like we're alive !

57:46.011 --> 57:53.344
And on that, I want us to raise our glasses, being alive, (Yeah ) to living, and to life.

57:53.386 --> 57:56.928
and others To life(All cheer)

57:57.886 --> 57:59.469
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

57:59.511 --> 58:02.386
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

58:04.136 --> 58:05.636
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

58:07.386 --> 58:08.928
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

58:16.969 --> 58:18.428
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

58:23.261 --> 58:24.803
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

58:24.844 --> 58:27.844
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

58:32.178 --> 58:34.553
Where do you find such absolutely wonderful people?

58:34.553 --> 58:36.386
I've never seen anyone like that.

58:48.178 --> 58:49.594
She's the real mad one !

59:19.803 --> 59:20.761
with Seven !

59:20.803 --> 59:21.511
Six !

59:21.553 --> 59:22.469
Five !

59:22.511 --> 59:23.261
Four !

59:23.303 --> 59:24.011
Three !

59:24.053 --> 59:24.761
Two !

59:24.803 --> 59:25.636
One !

59:26.011 --> 59:27.719
Happy New Year(cheers)

59:29.303 --> 59:31.344
1949 !

59:31.386 --> 59:33.136
Happy New Year !

59:33.803 --> 59:34.969
Love you as ever, Sal.

59:35.011 --> 59:35.886
Whatever man.

59:35.886 --> 59:36.511
Love you.

59:36.511 --> 59:36.928
Love you.

59:36.928 --> 59:38.053
What have you got?

59:52.928 --> 59:53.803
Hell of a night !

59:53.844 --> 59:55.511
Happy New Year ...

59:58.553 --> 59:59.178
I love you...

01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:05.886
Sal, I have something to ask of you, very important.

01:00:05.928 --> 01:00:06.844
Uh-uh.

01:00:06.886 --> 01:00:08.511
I wonder how you'll take it.

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:11.428
We're buddies, aren't we?

01:00:14.386 --> 01:00:15.094
Yeah?...

01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:17.928
Carlo's apartment, Harlem.

01:00:26.386 --> 01:00:28.261
Sal said yes, my darling.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:32.178
Sal, that's great.

01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:37.219
Well, hop in, the water's fine.

01:00:44.719 --> 01:00:45.303
What?

01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:30.636
Fuck, I can't do this !

01:01:30.677 --> 01:01:31.469
Come on, man.

01:01:31.511 --> 01:01:32.594
You promised.

01:01:32.636 --> 01:01:34.552
Do you really want to do this, Marylou?

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:37.844
She thinks it's swell.

01:01:52.052 --> 01:01:52.844
What?

01:01:52.886 --> 01:01:56.052
Now, come on now, we have to just all goddam relax !

01:01:57.761 --> 01:01:58.302
Dean.

01:01:58.344 --> 01:02:01.011
Can you go wait in the kitchen?

01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:03.677
Like now, please?

01:02:15.052 --> 01:02:17.302
Honey, he just wants to see what it would be like.

01:02:19.177 --> 01:02:22.469
I told him that I wouldn't do that with any guy (whispers) but you.

01:02:31.386 --> 01:02:33.219
Well, you can still change your mind.

01:03:04.261 --> 01:03:05.177
(Sound of Marylou and Dean having sex)Very good.

01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:21.927
(off) Gee.

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:22.552
Write that down.

01:03:22.594 --> 01:03:23.677
I got it.

01:03:27.844 --> 01:03:30.844
So Ed, why did you abandon Galatea in Tucson?

01:03:30.886 --> 01:03:32.344
She's your wife.

01:03:34.302 --> 01:03:37.011
What are you doing wandering around the country like this?

01:03:37.052 --> 01:03:42.094
Dean, why did you leave Camille and pick up Marylou?

01:03:42.136 --> 01:03:44.219
What are your womanly intentions?

01:03:44.219 --> 01:03:49.552
And, what is this mad obsession you have with him?

01:03:52.302 --> 01:03:54.677
(laughs)What is this mad obsession you have with him?

01:03:56.802 --> 01:03:57.719
Touche !

01:03:59.886 --> 01:04:01.844
Days of wrath are coming my friends.

01:04:03.802 --> 01:04:05.094
This high you're on is a mirage.

01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:10.844
You're all going to go flying off to the West Coast and come crashing down to earth.

01:04:11.969 --> 01:04:13.052
Like this, Carlo?

01:04:15.469 --> 01:04:16.552
Yeah, Dean.

01:04:18.552 --> 01:04:19.802
Exactly like that.

01:04:19.844 --> 01:04:21.677
Alrighty, who's hungry?

01:04:34.219 --> 01:04:40.802
We were leaving confusion and nonsense behind, and performing our one noble function of the time move.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.760
New Orleans and ol'Bull Lee.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.969
Then West.

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:50.844
It would take all night to talk about ol' Bull Lee.

01:04:52.177 --> 01:04:54.094
Let's just say now he was a teacher.

01:04:54.135 --> 01:04:57.802
And he had every right to teach, 'cuz he spent all his time learning.

01:05:16.927 --> 01:05:17.719
Now listen darling.

01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:24.052
You know that I'm capable of everything at the same time, and I have unlimited energy.

01:05:25.635 --> 01:05:30.052
So now when we get back to San Francisco we must absolutely go on living together.

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:34.302
I know just the place for you to live.

01:05:34.302 --> 01:05:39.260
I'll be home every night and be at Camille's by the morning.

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:42.344
We've done it before, see, she'll never know.

01:05:53.052 --> 01:05:57.677
<i>Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause.</i>

01:05:57.677 --> 01:06:03.094
<i>It decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce.</i>

01:06:03.135 --> 01:06:05.844
<i>Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral...</i>

01:06:07.469 --> 01:06:08.219
Shit.

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:09.302
Ed, slow down.

01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:11.302
Underpants.

01:06:25.802 --> 01:06:29.927
Do you guys think you can rush through here as fast as you want 'cuz you're from California?

01:06:30.969 --> 01:06:33.427
Don't worry officer, we're heading back to California.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.052
I need everybody to step out of that car, please.

01:06:45.094 --> 01:06:46.052
How old are you, young lady?

01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:48.094
I'm eighteen.

01:06:48.135 --> 01:06:50.385
Who's that guy you're with?

01:06:50.427 --> 01:06:51.885
My husband.

01:06:51.885 --> 01:06:55.885
I've got the certificate right in the back if you want to see it.

01:06:58.344 --> 01:07:00.802
Who you all in such a hurry to see out there in California?

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:03.510
My wife.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.052
Your wife?

01:07:07.094 --> 01:07:10.344
This one here just said she's your wife.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.802
She's my ex-wife.

01:07:12.844 --> 01:07:16.385
What the hell you doing with your ex-wife?

01:07:16.427 --> 01:07:17.760
You're going out to see your wife !

01:07:17.802 --> 01:07:18.635
That's not important.

01:07:18.677 --> 01:07:19.177
Hey boy !

01:07:19.219 --> 01:07:22.302
You gonna waltz in here and tell me what's important?

01:07:34.844 --> 01:07:37.635
It's gonna be 25 dollars for speeding.

01:07:37.677 --> 01:07:38.594
Or what?

01:07:38.594 --> 01:07:43.844
Or I can run you in right now and slap a special California-boy charge on your ass.

01:07:43.844 --> 01:07:44.635
Yeah?

01:07:44.677 --> 01:07:45.469
What charge?

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.010
Don't you worry about it, wise guy.

01:07:59.344 --> 01:08:01.052
That guy's got it so goddam easy !

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:03.010
They'll out and shoot you if you complain, too.

01:08:03.052 --> 01:08:04.844
I wish I had a fucking gun !

01:08:06.344 --> 01:08:08.218
Dunkel, you are not driving anymore.

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:11.968
Marylou, spread those knees and lets smoke some weed.

01:08:37.343 --> 01:08:38.176
It was my father's.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:42.385
It works.

01:08:52.218 --> 01:08:53.135
Thanks a lot.

01:09:03.301 --> 01:09:04.385
Flomaton, Alabama

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:08.176
<i>Don't know...</i>

01:09:08.218 --> 01:09:09.872
<i>When it comes to buying a gift or it comes to buy a present, </i>

01:09:09.872 --> 01:09:12.365
<i>I never have to wonder, I never have to thunder.</i>

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:16.125
<i>If it's a wedding present, if it's an engagement present, if its a shower,</i>

01:09:16.126 --> 01:09:19.890
<i> it it's a husband who wants to buy his wife something, I know exactly what to say...</i>

01:09:20.635 --> 01:09:21.718
<i>I go to...</i>

01:09:22.801 --> 01:09:24.926
Like President Truman says.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:27.635
"You have to cut down on the cost of living."

01:09:27.635 --> 01:09:29.926
Yes, yes we do.

01:09:49.468 --> 01:09:52.135
I'm telling you it's true Sal, I started at 9.

01:09:53.218 --> 01:09:54.635
With a girl named Millie Mayfair !

01:09:54.677 --> 01:09:57.760
That's when my old man was barbering a bit still.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:10:03.260
Oh honey Marylou, if only I'd known you then, how sweet you must have been at 9 !

01:10:04.677 --> 01:10:06.343
Hey, here's another one for you Sal.

01:10:06.427 --> 01:10:09.510
One time I jumped a freight from New Mexico clear to LA.

01:10:09.593 --> 01:10:10.468
And I was 11.

01:10:10.468 --> 01:10:15.927
I lost my father along the side, and we were staying in a hobo jungle and I hadn't seen him for months.

01:10:15.968 --> 01:10:20.954
So, by the time I get to LA I'm so starved for milk that I get a job right in the dairy

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:24.489
and straight off drink 2 quarts of heavy cream and just puke

01:10:27.885 --> 01:10:29.593
Poor, tragic Dean

01:11:02.927 --> 01:11:06.093
So Dunkel, I suppose you're happy to get back to your wife.

01:11:23.177 --> 01:11:24.010
Algiers, Louisiana

01:11:39.385 --> 01:11:40.176
Bull?

01:11:43.343 --> 01:11:44.010
Jane?

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:48.260
Hello?

01:12:07.385 --> 01:12:07.968
Bull?

01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:17.468
Bull?

01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:23.760
Bull?

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.843
That sounds like the angel Sal Paradise.

01:12:35.676 --> 01:12:36.468
How are you?

01:12:41.135 --> 01:12:41.885
Fair.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:52.635
Hi Jane !

01:12:54.593 --> 01:12:56.260
We finally brought Ed Dunkel with us.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.843
Is Galatea home?

01:13:01.843 --> 01:13:02.968
Excuse me.

01:13:05.093 --> 01:13:06.135
Lizards.

01:13:26.343 --> 01:13:27.010
Ed?

01:13:29.301 --> 01:13:30.301
Hi, Galatea

01:13:32.176 --> 01:13:33.843
Get out of my sight !

01:13:34.593 --> 01:13:35.551
You're an animal !

01:13:35.593 --> 01:13:38.385
I guess I'll go help the missus sweep the tree.

01:13:38.426 --> 01:13:40.301
Ass !

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:43.801
You're Sal, right?

01:13:43.843 --> 01:13:45.968
It depends.

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:47.801
Do you know what these bastards did to me?

01:13:47.843 --> 01:13:51.926
Dean leaves his wife and baby penniless because he wants to visit you.

01:13:51.968 --> 01:13:55.260
And Ed, being a sheep wants to tag along.

01:13:55.301 --> 01:13:56.885
Only they have no money !

01:13:56.926 --> 01:14:01.051
So Ed asks me for the money, and I say, "I'm not giving you any unless we're married."

01:14:01.093 --> 01:14:04.426
And Dean says, "Hey, Ed, stupid ass.

01:14:04.468 --> 01:14:05.676
Marry the broad !

01:14:05.718 --> 01:14:06.885
"No, I do love you too, honey...

01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:07.385
Shut up !

01:14:07.718 --> 01:14:09.301
So he marries me for gas fare !

01:14:09.343 --> 01:14:12.347
And we get in the car, and Dean drives like Satan,

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:14.698
smoking marijuana the whole way,

01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:17.026
and they won't even let me stop to use the ladies room.

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:22.718
And when I say something about it, they dump me in Tucson. In Tucson!

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:25.676
Come on, Galatea.

01:14:25.718 --> 01:14:27.010
I mean.

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.426
Dean will be dead some day and then what can you say to him?

01:14:29.426 --> 01:14:30.801
The sooner he's dead, the better.

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.385
Where were you going?

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:38.801
Can't I watch you guys screw?

01:14:41.218 --> 01:14:42.801
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:14:42.801 --> 01:14:44.468
A week, a couple of weeks.

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:45.010
I just thought...

01:14:45.051 --> 01:14:45.885
You just thought what?

01:14:45.926 --> 01:14:48.218
You could just leave me here in this house with strangers?

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:08.719
"Old woman, old woman, old woman, quoth I, "

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.159
"Oh whither, oh whither, oh whither so high "

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.124
"To brush the cobwebs off the sky"

01:15:16.039 --> 01:15:17.652
"Shall I go with thee?"

01:15:20.093 --> 01:15:21.384
I would go with her.

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:25.836
We could go together, and we could brush the cobwebs from the sky.

01:15:26.426 --> 01:15:28.676
"By and by, by and by."

01:15:28.718 --> 01:15:31.509
What the hell has he ever done to anyone?

01:15:31.509 --> 01:15:34.426
Well, he drove my mother halfway across the country.

01:15:34.468 --> 01:15:35.468
Did he?

01:15:35.509 --> 01:15:36.301
Yeah.

01:15:37.551 --> 01:15:38.468
Nah...

01:15:39.884 --> 01:15:43.468
Dean does not feel responsibility towards others.

01:15:43.509 --> 01:15:45.343
He does not know the concept.

01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:51.509
Then again, he feels others have some mysterious obligation to support him.

01:15:52.384 --> 01:15:53.634
No, I'm OK, Bull.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:57.051
I find it unspeakably distasteful.

01:15:57.093 --> 01:16:00.301
But Dean gives everyone a damn good time just being himself

01:16:00.301 --> 01:16:02.259
He gives illusions.

01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:03.259
Tricks.

01:16:03.301 --> 01:16:07.801
Maybe that's because you're not seeing what's really holy about Dean.

01:16:07.843 --> 01:16:10.509
So he's a holy man now !

01:16:10.551 --> 01:16:13.343
A religious figure in your eyes !

01:16:13.384 --> 01:16:14.968
Argh, Paradise ...

01:16:14.968 --> 01:16:17.801
Aren't you a pretty little bird?...

01:16:17.843 --> 01:16:20.593
What I see in him is compulsive psychosis.

01:16:20.634 --> 01:16:25.176
Dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence.

01:16:31.968 --> 01:16:36.301
Well, young man, I do believe the cocktail hour is upon us.

01:16:38.676 --> 01:16:43.426
Now this nation is dead in its soul and we do nothing.

01:16:43.468 --> 01:16:47.051
All we do is wait, for the end to come.

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:49.176
See?

01:16:49.218 --> 01:16:49.801
She knows.

01:16:49.843 --> 01:16:52.176
The female always knows.

01:16:52.218 --> 01:16:55.759
And the end of the world will start here, too.

01:16:55.843 --> 01:16:57.551
In Texas.

01:16:58.343 --> 01:16:59.218
Louisiana.

01:17:00.926 --> 01:17:03.468
Louisiana and Texas.

01:17:05.468 --> 01:17:07.593
This is an outstanding martini.

01:17:07.634 --> 01:17:09.676
Yes.

01:17:09.676 --> 01:17:11.593
May I?

01:17:11.634 --> 01:17:13.051
Please.

01:17:13.051 --> 01:17:13.801
MmmMmm.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.176
That is an outstanding martini.

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:32.468
You know that a bat, when they suck the blood out of things squirrels, and...

01:17:32.509 --> 01:17:33.843
Dad, draw a face.

01:17:33.884 --> 01:17:35.426
Dad draw a face.

01:17:35.468 --> 01:17:43.343
They got teeth, long teeth, that's what they stick in the squirrels and then they suck the blood out of them.

01:17:43.384 --> 01:17:45.509
What's their names?

01:17:45.509 --> 01:17:50.759
I think, uh, Lorraine is a good name for a bat.

01:17:50.801 --> 01:17:52.509
That's Lorraine

01:17:52.509 --> 01:17:57.634
I need some wings on it like that, ain't that right, you little beast?

01:17:57.676 --> 01:17:58.935
Here the toes.

01:17:59.991 --> 01:18:02.464
I'm gonna sell it for a lot of money.

01:18:02.465 --> 01:18:03.465
Money...

01:18:36.426 --> 01:18:38.967
Translation is indeed treason.

01:18:39.009 --> 01:18:40.467
I got him.

01:18:40.509 --> 01:18:42.342
In English you got him saying "fingers rummaging...

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.217
person...

01:18:43.259 --> 01:18:44.217
in his pockets".

01:18:44.259 --> 01:18:46.634
Celine did not write that.

01:18:46.676 --> 01:18:51.009
He wrote, "Hands in assholes and pockets."

01:18:51.009 --> 01:18:52.134
Uh.

01:18:55.217 --> 01:19:01.842
Well, um, if you could push it away from here.

01:19:01.884 --> 01:19:04.259
Away, um, the crumbs.

01:19:04.301 --> 01:19:07.717
So, how's it been with Ed?

01:19:07.759 --> 01:19:10.551
I don't know how to do it.

01:19:11.801 --> 01:19:13.509
How to make him happy.

01:19:15.592 --> 01:19:18.176
Oh, it's simple really, honey, all you have to do is...

01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:25.842
Okay, I'm.

01:19:25.842 --> 01:19:29.301
Here is you, here's him, right here.

01:19:29.342 --> 01:19:31.009
palm of your hand.

01:19:31.051 --> 01:19:34.926
I mean, with mouth, but he'll be in the palm of your hand.

01:19:34.967 --> 01:19:36.842
Boys always love that.

01:19:36.842 --> 01:19:39.051
You'll love it too, I promise.

01:19:42.509 --> 01:19:43.426
Merci

01:19:45.426 --> 01:19:53.717
Now, something can and should be done to eliminate the black seed of noxious effluviants gestating in our unsuspecting gut.

01:19:53.759 --> 01:19:57.592
I give you the orgone accumulator !

01:19:57.592 --> 01:20:02.426
Captures the vibratory atmospheric atoms of the life principal.

01:20:02.467 --> 01:20:06.467
Folks get cancer 'cuz they run out of orgone.

01:20:06.467 --> 01:20:07.801
Come on !

01:20:07.842 --> 01:20:09.426
You gotta try it with me.

01:20:09.467 --> 01:20:11.884
It'll put some juice in your bones, I'm telling you.

01:20:11.926 --> 01:20:17.592
I always rush up and take off 90 miles to the nearest whore house !

01:20:19.884 --> 01:20:24.092
All right, oh hey, look at that, see how big he got?

01:20:24.176 --> 01:20:28.176
See that, not an inch of cancer !

01:20:32.009 --> 01:20:32.926
Let's crank her up.

01:20:35.259 --> 01:20:37.509
And don't let the cocksuckers get you down

01:20:37.509 --> 01:20:39.217
Looks like a fucking closet

01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:49.509
The purity of the road.

01:20:51.551 --> 01:20:58.176
The white line in the middle of the highway unrolled, and hugged our left front tire as if glued to our groove.

01:20:58.217 --> 01:21:00.592
Dunkel, Dunkle, who's gonna shepherd you now?

01:21:00.634 --> 01:21:02.967
Here are a couple bucks for you.

01:21:02.967 --> 01:21:04.759
You know you don't have to do that, Bull.

01:21:04.801 --> 01:21:06.509
It's alright, it's only money.

01:21:06.551 --> 01:21:07.759
Thanks.

01:21:07.801 --> 01:21:08.967
Don't forget to write !

01:21:09.009 --> 01:21:10.051
I won't.

01:21:10.092 --> 01:21:11.176
Bye, brother.

01:21:12.842 --> 01:21:14.842
Dean, you keep her out of the ditch !

01:21:24.717 --> 01:21:26.259
And zoom went the car!

01:21:26.301 --> 01:21:28.217
And we were off again - for California.

01:21:57.426 --> 01:21:59.176
Hey, listen to this one, Sal.

01:22:00.676 --> 01:22:03.176
"'Not caring for their lives' is it?

01:22:03.217 --> 01:22:05.908
Why, what in the world is there that we should care

01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:10.899
for if it is not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time."

01:22:16.717 --> 01:22:18.134
What do you think about that one, Sal?

01:22:19.175 --> 01:22:20.050
Welcome.

01:22:20.467 --> 01:22:21.009
I'll be right with you.

01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.425
Thanks.

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:44.550
Willcox, Arizona

01:23:08.967 --> 01:23:10.759
Can't you wait 'til we're in Frisco?

01:23:14.134 --> 01:23:15.134
I don't care.

01:23:15.134 --> 01:23:17.300
Dean's gonna leave me anyway.

01:23:20.384 --> 01:23:21.717
When are you going to go back to Denver?

01:23:24.509 --> 01:23:25.259
I don't know.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.342
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:23:27.384 --> 01:23:29.509
I could go back to my fiance.

01:23:31.925 --> 01:23:32.842
Fiance?

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.300
He's a sailor.

01:23:35.342 --> 01:23:37.634
He's been away awhile.

01:23:37.675 --> 01:23:38.509
He's.

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:39.134
he's nice.

01:23:39.175 --> 01:23:40.509
That's good.

01:23:44.925 --> 01:23:47.092
I wish Dean wasn't so crazy now.

01:23:47.134 --> 01:23:49.092
You could be wishing that the rest of your life !

01:23:51.884 --> 01:23:53.050
I just want a house.

01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:54.467
A baby.

01:23:56.509 --> 01:23:57.884
You know, something normal.

01:23:57.925 --> 01:23:59.592
I really do want that.

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:14.425
I just had a great idea, you guys are gonna love it.

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:17.634
Is everybody absolutely comfortable?

01:24:29.884 --> 01:24:30.884
You alright Sal?

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.217
(Yeah.

01:24:59.217 --> 01:25:04.350
"For it always happened when I woke like this and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt

01:25:04.351 --> 01:25:11.118
to discover where I was, everything would be moving around me through the darkness, things, places, years.

01:25:11.675 --> 01:25:15.342
My body still too heavy with sleep to move."

01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:38.092
How much money you got, kid?

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.258
Nothing.

01:25:39.258 --> 01:25:41.758
But I got an aunt in Tulare, California.

01:25:41.842 --> 01:25:45.508
She owns a grocery store and as soon as we get there, I'll have money for you all.

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:52.925
Yes, yes, we all got aunts, well let's go jump in back, let's see the aunts and uncles and grocery stores all away across the road to get our kicks.

01:25:55.258 --> 01:25:55.883
I'm Alfred.

01:25:55.883 --> 01:25:56.592
Sal.

01:25:56.592 --> 01:25:57.300
Hi.

01:25:57.342 --> 01:25:57.967
Marylou.

01:25:58.008 --> 01:25:58.633
Hi.

01:25:58.675 --> 01:25:59.092
Alfred.

01:26:02.967 --> 01:26:09.258
Hot damn, I left Bakersfield in a travel bureau car, left my guitar in the trunk of another one.

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.550
It never showed up.

01:26:11.758 --> 01:26:13.342
Guitars and cowboy duds.

01:26:13.383 --> 01:26:14.800
How much you got?

01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:16.300
How much you want?

01:26:30.508 --> 01:26:34.758
I knew a man, he forgave his wife for shooting him and got her out of jail.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.633
Only, she shoots him a second time !

01:26:41.633 --> 01:26:42.717
That's a good one

01:26:43.383 --> 01:26:45.467
Hold on to your girdles

01:26:49.092 --> 01:26:50.633
Baby !

01:27:00.758 --> 01:27:03.133
Yes, yes, yes

01:27:34.092 --> 01:27:39.694
(singing) Had my finger on the trigger so long

01:27:40.614 --> 01:27:44.789
Seems like I'd shoot again by now

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:51.553
So hard when you can't stand the sound

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.687
I gathered your remains, cleaned up the stains

01:27:59.688 --> 01:28:04.477
I took care for we once were friends

01:28:05.821 --> 01:28:11.364
But it's hard when you're burning in a hell

01:28:13.678 --> 01:28:20.517
And it's hard enough to be in love

01:28:21.677 --> 01:28:29.447
And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

01:28:46.967 --> 01:28:47.925
San Francisco, California

01:29:24.727 --> 01:29:25.203
(low) Alright.

01:29:29.836 --> 01:29:30.555
Go, hurry !

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:35.225
Really, you better make it to Camille's in time for dinner so she can feed your lazy ass !

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.516
Do you see what a bastard he is?

01:30:11.641 --> 01:30:13.058
By the end of the week, darling.

01:30:17.183 --> 01:30:17.891
Thank you.

01:30:17.933 --> 01:30:19.808
Thank you.

01:32:32.516 --> 01:32:33.808
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop !

01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:58.141
Darling Sal, I'm going back to Denver, to my fiance the sailor.

01:32:58.183 --> 01:33:00.433
No more road for me.

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:03.599
Thanks for an amazing night, my sweet lover.

01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:07.349
Why don'tyou kick Dean in the ass if you ever see him again.

01:33:07.391 --> 01:33:09.099
I love you.

01:33:09.141 --> 01:33:10.974
P.S.

01:33:11.391 --> 01:33:12.558
Good luck with your book.

01:34:54.808 --> 01:34:56.058
What the hell you looking at?

01:35:05.141 --> 01:35:07.558
Campbell, California

01:35:47.838 --> 01:35:48.378
Yoshi.

01:35:51.843 --> 01:35:52.704
Brada.

01:35:56.724 --> 01:35:57.433
Rodriguez.

01:36:00.472 --> 01:36:01.221
Luigi.

01:37:09.114 --> 01:37:12.641
Sal.. Shit, no. Oh oh oh

01:37:15.391 --> 01:37:16.557
How the hell are you, man?

01:37:16.599 --> 01:37:18.557
Better than you, my boy.

01:37:18.557 --> 01:37:20.057
Have you eaten these last few months?

01:37:20.099 --> 01:37:21.974
Not as much as you, fat ass !

01:37:27.214 --> 01:37:28.849
Family man, huh?

01:37:28.891 --> 01:37:29.807
Yeah.

01:37:32.016 --> 01:37:32.849
How's Camille?

01:37:32.891 --> 01:37:34.641
She's good, she's just resting.

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:36.807
Where's the Hudson?

01:37:36.849 --> 01:37:38.516
Yeah.

01:37:38.557 --> 01:37:42.224
Man, it's so beat I had to leave it on Market Street for the vultures.

01:37:42.266 --> 01:37:43.266
Oh, shit.

01:37:48.099 --> 01:37:48.807
And Marylou?

01:37:48.849 --> 01:37:51.932
That dumb little box married one of her sailors.

01:37:54.016 --> 01:37:57.405
And he's threatened to kill me if he finds me, so I'm gonna have to defend myself

01:37:57.406 --> 01:37:59.782
and kill him and go to San Quentin for life.

01:38:00.224 --> 01:38:01.807
That would be the end of me.

01:38:01.849 --> 01:38:03.516
Oh, come on

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:09.266
How's your ma?

01:38:09.307 --> 01:38:12.016
Still waiting for that 15 bucks you owe her !

01:38:14.724 --> 01:38:16.557
Yeah, one day...

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:18.891
Guess what.

01:38:18.891 --> 01:38:21.224
I'm gonna be a father again.

01:38:21.266 --> 01:38:22.599
Really?

01:38:22.641 --> 01:38:23.266
Yeah.

01:38:23.307 --> 01:38:28.849
Sweet little Amy, she can stand alone for 30 seconds, she's 22 pounds and 29 inches long.

01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:32.847
And I found out that she's 31 one fourth percent English,

01:38:32.848 --> 01:38:35.079
27 and a half percent German,

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:38.479
27 percent Irish, 8 and three fourths percent Dutch,

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.711
7 percent Scotch and one hundred percent wonderful.

01:38:42.307 --> 01:38:43.849
Yes.

01:38:59.557 --> 01:39:00.557
Hush.

01:39:06.849 --> 01:39:08.391
Ahh, heebie jeebies !

01:39:08.432 --> 01:39:11.057
We gotta find ourselves some kicks.

01:39:20.099 --> 01:39:21.307
Sal's here.

01:39:21.349 --> 01:39:22.724
I heard.

01:39:24.891 --> 01:39:27.182
He wants to take me out to hear some music.

01:39:27.224 --> 01:39:28.516
You wish to come?

01:39:29.891 --> 01:39:32.182
Who's gonna stay here and take care of Amy?

01:39:32.224 --> 01:39:34.432
Alright then, I'll just go.

01:39:45.849 --> 01:39:50.307
Dean, don't make yourself feel better by asking me along

01:39:51.015 --> 01:39:52.432
I'll be back in a little bit.

01:40:08.557 --> 01:40:09.099
Sal !

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.474
By Marylou's cunt, it can't be !

01:40:11.974 --> 01:40:12.599
What?

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:17.839
That's 1.10 a ticket and a dime each for the jackets.

01:40:18.265 --> 01:40:20.057
Can I hear a vouchii?

01:40:20.099 --> 01:40:21.182
Vouchii !

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:23.474
Can I hear a sharooni mo' mo' mo' mo' mo'?

01:40:23.515 --> 01:40:25.765
Sharooni mo' mo'mo'mo'!

01:40:25.807 --> 01:40:26.974
You left out one mo' !

01:40:26.974 --> 01:40:27.849
Let me hear that last mo' !

01:40:27.849 --> 01:40:28.390
Mo' !

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:29.224
Mo'!

01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.015
No way

01:40:33.765 --> 01:40:34.599
Yip-rok!

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.849
Hereesi!

01:41:07.307 --> 01:41:10.599
Look at that, Slim knows time, Sal !

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.432
He knows time !

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:45.640
Thank you !

01:41:45.682 --> 01:41:50.974
But most important my sure-ooni mo' loves you !

01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:54.640
Goodness !

01:41:54.682 --> 01:41:56.474
Oh my goodness !

01:41:56.515 --> 01:41:58.370
You are the bee's knees.

01:41:58.371 --> 01:42:01.434
Wanna take you home and wake up with fleas.

01:42:01.435 --> 01:42:05.127
Please, say hello to my future ex-wife!

01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:29.099
Hey, Camille !

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.640
Congratulations on the baby.

01:42:31.724 --> 01:42:32.724
If you.

01:42:32.807 --> 01:42:34.057
Sal, excuse me.

01:42:34.099 --> 01:42:35.807
Dean, I need to talk to you.

01:42:41.057 --> 01:42:42.307
I want you to get out.

01:42:43.599 --> 01:42:44.349
Just go.

01:42:44.349 --> 01:42:45.057
Just get out.

01:42:45.099 --> 01:42:45.932
Now, honey...

01:42:45.974 --> 01:42:46.390
No.

01:42:46.432 --> 01:42:49.849
You said you were going to take care of us and you were done fooling around.

01:42:53.265 --> 01:42:54.974
I know that look on your face, Dean.

01:42:55.807 --> 01:42:56.765
You're bored.

01:42:56.807 --> 01:43:01.015
You're sick of me, and you're sick of work, and the baby.

01:43:01.057 --> 01:43:01.765
I wanna.

01:43:01.807 --> 01:43:05.973
I just want you to take your friend and get out of my house.

01:43:15.807 --> 01:43:17.682
Do you realize how much I've given up for you?

01:43:41.432 --> 01:43:44.557
I never want you back.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.348
I never want to see you again !

01:43:56.432 --> 01:43:58.015
I'll see you very soon, I promise.

01:44:00.182 --> 01:44:01.807
Don't you dare lie to her, too.

01:44:01.848 --> 01:44:02.973
You're a liar.

01:44:02.973 --> 01:44:04.557
You're a liar.

01:44:06.973 --> 01:44:09.973
Liar... Liar...

01:45:24.682 --> 01:45:29.223
I realized as we racked our brains for where to go and what to do, that it was up to me.

01:45:33.015 --> 01:45:37.140
I counted my money and showed it to Dean and said, "Come to New York (with me)."

01:45:37.182 --> 01:45:39.348
"Let's go to Denver first," he said.

01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:42.890
"This time we must absolutely find my father, Sal!"

01:45:47.557 --> 01:45:48.890
Your signature here...

01:45:49.098 --> 01:45:52.057
We're taking the semi-pristine Chrysler to Kansas.

01:45:52.265 --> 01:45:55.390
Along with yourselves, there's a nice young married couple.

01:45:55.432 --> 01:45:58.390
We share the gas expenses equally among the five of us.

01:46:00.307 --> 01:46:01.973
Are we all copacetic on that score gentlemen?

01:46:05.098 --> 01:46:06.057
Yeah.

01:46:59.931 --> 01:47:00.723
Ola

01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:09.806
I'm very glad you have accepted my invitation to a few drinks after that perilous journey.

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.390
Ah, no problem, amigo.

01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.848
Thank you.

01:47:23.931 --> 01:47:24.973
Hmm, whiskey

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.723
I like young men like you.

01:47:39.265 --> 01:47:42.223
You probably don't believe it, but, uh.

01:47:44.515 --> 01:47:48.556
the truth is, I really don't like girls.

01:47:48.598 --> 01:47:50.265
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

01:47:50.306 --> 01:47:52.265
Excuse me.

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:10.640
To tell you the straight deal, I sometimes had to survive the streets of Denver by working far into the night.

01:48:12.598 --> 01:48:14.098
Yes, I can appreciate, uh...

01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:16.556
"Never leave a customer unsatisfied."

01:48:16.598 --> 01:48:19.098
I had that tattooed on my ass.

01:48:25.431 --> 01:48:28.973
Perhaps there will be some money involved...

01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:32.265
Oh, yeah?

01:49:01.598 --> 01:49:02.181
Ah.

01:49:02.223 --> 01:49:03.806
Ah.

01:49:03.848 --> 01:49:04.848
Jesus !

01:49:20.973 --> 01:49:23.473
Denver, Colorado

01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:42.181
You see?

01:49:42.223 --> 01:49:44.848
You give them what they secretly want and they just panic.

01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:55.473
And here you go.

01:49:55.515 --> 01:49:56.556
Club, extra mayo.

01:49:56.598 --> 01:49:58.306
Enjoy.

01:50:02.848 --> 01:50:04.889
Look, I did it for us, man.

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:06.139
I got twenty bucks off the old fag.

01:50:36.223 --> 01:50:39.264
My old man, a little guy, Moriarty.

01:50:39.306 --> 01:50:41.139
Known in these parts as "the Barber".

01:50:41.181 --> 01:50:42.848
"Moriarty"?

01:50:42.889 --> 01:50:44.223
No.

01:50:44.264 --> 01:50:45.639
Never heard of him.

01:50:57.223 --> 01:50:58.264
Sorry, son.

01:50:58.306 --> 01:51:00.139
I ain't seen your old man in.

01:51:00.139 --> 01:51:01.723
I don't know how many years.

01:51:44.639 --> 01:51:45.723
New York, 1950

01:51:54.723 --> 01:51:56.681
How long have we known each other?

01:51:56.723 --> 01:51:58.139
5 years?

01:51:58.181 --> 01:51:59.264
5 pretty good years.

01:51:59.306 --> 01:52:00.389
Who are we now?

01:52:00.473 --> 01:52:02.181
Who are we, yes?

01:52:02.223 --> 01:52:03.098
Who are we now?

01:52:03.139 --> 01:52:04.514
ah, a simple question.

01:52:04.556 --> 01:52:06.139
Are you gonna tell us, Carlo?

01:52:08.223 --> 01:52:09.264
I know I'm 23.

01:52:11.639 --> 01:52:16.556
I know that I rely on my friends and my family for money...

01:52:16.598 --> 01:52:17.764
Ah, ah.

01:52:17.806 --> 01:52:19.264
Join that club, please !

01:52:19.306 --> 01:52:20.889
I know I will.

01:52:20.889 --> 01:52:22.556
I know there's no gold at the end of the rainbow.

01:52:24.098 --> 01:52:26.806
There's just shit and piss.

01:52:26.848 --> 01:52:30.223
But to know that, that makes me free.

01:53:13.639 --> 01:53:15.973
<i>You come in contact with social controls.</i>

01:53:17.639 --> 01:53:21.639
<i>With custom, with moral code, and with law.</i>

01:53:21.723 --> 01:53:26.223
<i>The town or city in which you live has laws which control you.</i>

01:53:26.264 --> 01:53:30.347
<i>There are state laws, and the federal government in your name...</i>

01:53:46.097 --> 01:53:47.556
Mexico, huh?

01:53:50.014 --> 01:53:52.222
Damn Sal, that's big

01:53:53.639 --> 01:53:54.931
You know, I've been thinking.

01:53:56.306 --> 01:53:57.431
I've never been south.

01:53:59.639 --> 01:54:02.431
Damn, Sal, I wish you weren't going.

01:54:02.472 --> 01:54:05.972
It'll be my first timein ol' New York without my good boy.

01:54:10.639 --> 01:54:11.597
Shit, Sal.

01:54:11.639 --> 01:54:13.972
We haven't talked straight in a long time.

01:54:16.681 --> 01:54:17.681
Yeah, I know.

01:54:17.722 --> 01:54:19.181
Yeah.

01:54:19.222 --> 01:54:20.597
You see, man.

01:54:21.806 --> 01:54:24.806
The older you get, those troubles just keep piling on.

01:54:32.431 --> 01:54:33.389
Look at this.

01:54:37.681 --> 01:54:38.722
That's Joanie.

01:54:40.056 --> 01:54:41.847
Look at that smile, too.

01:54:41.889 --> 01:54:43.806
Ain't she gonna break some hearts

01:54:43.806 --> 01:54:45.056
Yeah.

01:54:47.222 --> 01:54:48.264
She's beautiful.

01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:56.389
Did I tell you Marylou's pregnant?

01:54:59.681 --> 01:55:02.264
Well if it speaks French-Canadian, it's a complete coincidence

01:55:07.681 --> 01:55:09.139
(laughs) Shit

01:55:16.347 --> 01:55:17.264
I'll leave you to it.

01:55:20.389 --> 01:55:21.472
Thanks for the visit.

01:55:22.847 --> 01:55:23.681
I'll write you.

01:55:23.722 --> 01:55:25.431
I know you will.

01:55:31.139 --> 01:55:32.014
Take care buddy.

01:55:32.056 --> 01:55:32.847
Go get 'em !

01:55:41.597 --> 01:55:42.306
Hey, Sal !

01:55:43.764 --> 01:55:46.431
Now you know I habla la espanol, don't you?

01:56:11.347 --> 01:56:12.722
La Estrella, Mexico

01:56:20.597 --> 01:56:21.139
Gracias

01:56:21.681 --> 01:56:22.889
Sir, sir !

01:56:22.972 --> 01:56:23.889
Do you like it?

01:56:23.931 --> 01:56:24.972
60 pesos.

01:56:26.181 --> 01:56:26.972
No, gracias.

01:56:28.556 --> 01:56:29.139
Hey kid !

01:56:29.222 --> 01:56:31.389
You got any marijuana?

01:56:31.431 --> 01:56:32.722
Marijuana?

01:56:32.764 --> 01:56:33.389
Si.

01:56:33.431 --> 01:56:34.347
Si si si.

01:56:51.472 --> 01:56:54.556
Those are my brothers, my sister and my grandmother too.

01:56:57.681 --> 01:56:58.806
Well, shit.

01:57:22.097 --> 01:57:24.555
Your 'ma could learn a few lessons from this kid's grandma.

01:57:26.597 --> 01:57:27.555
A man of word !

01:57:31.805 --> 01:57:32.514
Victor.

01:57:33.597 --> 01:57:37.014
This is the biggest bomber of tea I have ever smoked

01:57:40.847 --> 01:57:41.930
What's his name?

01:57:43.264 --> 01:57:44.055
Thomas.

01:57:46.847 --> 01:57:47.805
Thomas.

01:57:47.847 --> 01:57:48.639
Thomas.

01:57:53.305 --> 01:57:54.055
(In car)Thomas?...

01:58:08.597 --> 01:58:09.930
"El Paraiso" !

01:58:27.014 --> 01:58:27.555
Hola (or CLUB OWNER?

01:58:27.597 --> 01:58:29.305
) Hola, welcome to paradise !

01:58:29.347 --> 01:58:31.805
CLUB OWNER Do you like girls?

01:59:42.805 --> 01:59:50.014
Mucho, mucho loveMexico City is the holy place for more !

01:59:51.805 --> 01:59:52.389
You're the best.

01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.889
Gracias.

01:59:52.930 --> 01:59:53.472
Thank you.

01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:59.680
Look at this traffic, Sal !

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:01.097
Everybody just goes !

02:00:04.514 --> 02:00:05.722
Dig those faces.

02:00:05.764 --> 02:00:07.305
I want to be one of them !

02:00:13.097 --> 02:00:13.930
Now we gotta eat this.

02:00:21.639 --> 02:00:22.264
.How much?

02:00:22.305 --> 02:00:27.139
We've got so much, we're rich !

02:00:36.472 --> 02:00:37.805
They look just like us.

02:00:37.847 --> 02:00:38.888
See, they're brothers !

02:00:44.805 --> 02:00:47.597
My brother, I can smell the marijuana !

02:00:48.972 --> 02:00:49.763
Yes !

02:01:16.555 --> 02:01:22.013
Voyager, c'est bien utile, ga fait travailler l'imagination.

02:01:22.055 --> 02:01:25.305
Tout le reste n'est que deceptions et fatigues.

02:01:25.305 --> 02:01:27.847
Prends soin de ta mere.

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:32.430
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:33.930
Voila sa force.

02:01:33.930 --> 02:01:35.847
Il va de la vie a la mort.

02:01:35.847 --> 02:01:36.597
To the West.

02:01:36.597 --> 02:01:38.680
To the West.

02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.847
"You got no calluses, Sal."

02:01:41.305 --> 02:01:43.347
C'est un moment...

02:01:46.722 --> 02:01:47.972
Notre voyage a nous est entierement imaginaire.

02:01:48.013 --> 02:01:49.763
"(indistinct dialogue, baby crying) C'est oublie!

02:01:49.805 --> 02:01:50.847
I've never been able to kill myself.

02:01:50.888 --> 02:01:53.388
I am at your immediate disposal.

02:01:53.388 --> 02:01:54.888
Immediate disposal.

02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:58.513
Because you've crushed all the poetry you had in you.

02:01:58.555 --> 02:02:04.513
Take a close look at yourself and the degree of rottenness you've come to.

02:02:05.763 --> 02:02:07.555
You can't deny the blood guilt.

02:02:07.597 --> 02:02:08.847
You 're white.

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:10.222
White!

02:02:10.263 --> 02:02:12.180
White

02:02:27.138 --> 02:02:28.805
Poor Sal got sick.

02:02:28.847 --> 02:02:30.180
Poor Sal got sick.

02:02:32.638 --> 02:02:34.180
Dysentery, man.

02:02:37.472 --> 02:02:39.972
Now listen if you can hear in your sickness, my boy.

02:02:40.055 --> 02:02:44.305
I got my divorce with Camille down here, and I gotta get back if the car can hold up.

02:02:46.305 --> 02:02:47.305
Not that again.

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.430
All that again, good buddy.

02:02:51.472 --> 02:02:52.638
I've got to get back to my life.

02:02:53.805 --> 02:02:55.222
Wish I didn't have to go.

02:03:09.222 --> 02:03:10.847
Yes, yes, yes.

02:03:10.888 --> 02:03:12.888
I gotta go now, ol' fever Sal.

02:03:18.138 --> 02:03:19.055
Goodbye.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.555
Ozone Park, 1951

02:04:17.721 --> 02:04:18.263
Humm.

02:04:18.305 --> 02:04:19.513
Pour toi.

02:04:22.471 --> 02:04:23.221
Merci.

02:04:33.971 --> 02:04:36.768
(Book title) Denver Doldrums- For S.P. and D.M.

02:04:36.768 --> 02:04:39.614
the secret heroes of these poems - Poems by Carlo Marx

02:04:47.263 --> 02:04:53.786
I would rather go mad, gone down the track to Mexico, heroin dripping in my veins,

02:04:53.787 --> 02:05:02.290
eyes and ears full of marijuana, eating the god Peyote on the floor of a mudhut on the border...

02:05:02.888 --> 02:05:08.283
rather jar my body down the road, crying by a diner in the Western sun;

02:05:08.284 --> 02:05:19.522
rather crawl on my naked belly over tincans in Cincinnati; rather drag a rotten railroad tieto a Golgotha in the Rockies;

02:05:19.523 --> 02:05:25.561
rather crowned with thorns in Galveston; nailed hand and foot in Los Angeles;

02:05:25.562 --> 02:05:30.536
raised up to die in Denver; pierced in the side in Chicago;

02:05:30.537 --> 02:05:37.561
perished and tombed in New Orleans; and resurrected somewhere on Garret Mountain.

02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:48.638
December, 1951

02:05:56.971 --> 02:05:57.846
(at a distance, to a woman) Hey.

02:06:10.388 --> 02:06:11.013
Sal?

02:06:13.846 --> 02:06:15.013
Is that you, man?

02:06:18.096 --> 02:06:19.221
(to his friends, very low) Hang on a minute.

02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:35.930
What are you doing in New York, man?

02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:40.263
Dear Sal...

02:06:42.971 --> 02:06:45.180
I came on the railroad pass.

02:06:45.221 --> 02:06:47.013
Old hard bench coaches.

02:06:48.263 --> 02:06:49.971
Crossing railroads.

02:06:50.055 --> 02:06:56.805
Long, long awful trip, five days and nights, just to see you, Sal.

02:06:59.346 --> 02:07:00.096
Are you alright?

02:07:02.471 --> 02:07:03.388
How's Camille?

02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:05.346
How are the babies?

02:07:22.388 --> 02:07:25.805
(then reading)"Dear Dean, Its the end of the first half of the century.

02:07:25.846 --> 02:07:29.929
Welcome with love and kisses to spend the other half with us.

02:07:32.888 --> 02:07:34.054
We all wait for you.

02:07:34.054 --> 02:07:36.971
Camille, Amy and little Joanie."

02:07:37.013 --> 02:07:39.263
That's great

02:07:39.263 --> 02:07:39.846
Yeah.

02:07:50.138 --> 02:07:56.388
We still haven't talked of Mexico, and us leaving, and the fever of last year.

02:07:56.429 --> 02:07:57.138
But we don't...

02:07:57.179 --> 02:07:58.638
Hey Sal, we gotta go, man !

02:07:59.429 --> 02:08:01.679
We don't have to talk about that right now.

02:08:01.721 --> 02:08:02.304
No.

02:08:03.429 --> 02:08:04.096
Hey.

02:08:04.138 --> 02:08:06.138
Hey Sal, for Christ's sake.

02:08:06.179 --> 02:08:08.388
Duke Ellington ain't gonna wait

02:08:08.804 --> 02:08:10.054
Yeah, just give me a minute, Remi !

02:08:10.096 --> 02:08:12.221
They're all waiting.

02:08:13.596 --> 02:08:14.263
Do you think.

02:08:14.304 --> 02:08:16.971
you can give me a ride to East 14th?

02:08:16.971 --> 02:08:21.304
I want to spend as much time with my boy as possible, you know.

02:08:23.304 --> 02:08:26.388
Man, I wish we didn't have tickets to this concert.

02:08:30.179 --> 02:08:30.721
Yeah.

02:08:49.179 --> 02:08:50.263
Bye, Dean.

02:08:59.763 --> 02:09:00.471
Hey, Sal !

02:09:05.096 --> 02:09:06.179
I love you as ever.

02:10:24.096 --> 02:10:31.471
I first met Dean not long after my father died...

02:10:34.221 --> 02:10:35.929
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl...

02:10:35.929 --> 02:10:39.388
Dean, I'll be goddamned!

02:10:39.388 --> 02:10:40.554
You're early...

02:10:40.554 --> 02:10:40.971
Yeah, well...

02:10:40.971 --> 02:10:43.221
around my finger...

02:10:43.221 --> 02:10:44.929
I was in reform school all the time.

02:10:45.763 --> 02:10:48.554
I was like a young punk asserting myself......

02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:57.513
and she stands on her head and she does the splits......

02:10:57.554 --> 02:10:59.387
"I need your cock!

02:10:59.429 --> 02:11:03.887
"The only people that interest me are the mad ones...

02:11:03.887 --> 02:11:05.971
Mad to live, mad to talk...

02:11:10.012 --> 02:11:12.012
<i>... the West coast and come crashing down to earth...</i>

02:11:12.054 --> 02:11:15.304
And the sound of the wild...

02:11:15.346 --> 02:11:16.471
Bless me, Father, for I will sin

02:11:16.512 --> 02:11:17.471
Man, I just love women!

02:11:17.512 --> 02:11:18.637
I just want a house...

02:11:18.679 --> 02:11:19.554
Ah, shit, Dean!

02:11:19.554 --> 02:11:19.887
a baby.

02:11:19.929 --> 02:11:20.471
Sal.

02:11:20.512 --> 02:11:22.137
I've come to ask you to teach me how to write.

02:11:22.179 --> 02:11:29.283
(singing)And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

02:11:29.283 --> 02:11:30.098
That Hudson goes!

02:11:39.926 --> 02:11:40.641
Hey, Sal !

02:11:46.379 --> 02:11:49.813
I love you as ever.

02:12:02.962 --> 02:12:10.587
So in America, when the sun goes down and I sit on the old, broken-down river pier, watching the long long skies over New Jersey,

02:12:10.587 --> 02:12:16.046
and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West coast,

02:12:16.087 --> 02:12:23.046
and all of that road going, and all the people dreaming in the immensity of it,

02:12:23.046 --> 02:12:28.296
and in Iowa I know by now that the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

02:12:28.296 --> 02:12:32.746
which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the Earth,

02:12:32.747 --> 02:12:37.372
darkens all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in,

02:12:37.407 --> 02:12:40.770
and nobody, nobody knows what is going to happen to anybody,

02:12:40.771 --> 02:12:44.207
besides the forlorn rags of growing old,

02:12:45.212 --> 02:12:50.285
I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of old Dean Moriarty, the father we never found,

02:12:51.331 --> 02:12:55.657
I think of Dean Moriarty, I think of Dean Moriarty.

02:13:15.796 --> 02:13:16.546
Can you hear me now?

02:13:19.421 --> 02:13:20.421
But anyway...

02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.754
Tonight also, I wrote a song, called "On the Road".

02:13:26.885 --> 02:13:29.921
I'm just rather reading what I wrote all night.

02:13:29.962 --> 02:13:32.837
There are better things coming than what I wrote all night.

02:13:32.879 --> 02:13:38.087
Straight from the mind to the voice, with no hand intervening.

02:13:38.129 --> 02:13:45.754
(singing) I left New York, 1949To go across the country without a dad-blame dime.

02:13:45.754 --> 02:13:56.962
Montana in the cold, cold fall Found my father in the gambling hallFather, Father where have you been?

02:13:57.004 --> 02:14:00.587
You've been in the world since I was a teen.

02:14:03.712 --> 02:14:10.671
Dear son, he said, don't worry about me I'm about to die of pleurisy

02:14:14.296 --> 02:14:20.087
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara,

02:14:20.129 --> 02:14:21.837
home I'll never be.

02:14:21.879 --> 02:14:29.504
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

02:14:29.545 --> 02:14:36.754
For better or worse, through thick and thinLike being married to the little woman.

02:14:36.795 --> 02:14:45.045
God loved me just like I loved himI want you do the same just for him.

02:14:45.087 --> 02:14:49.295
The worms eat away but don't worry, watch the wind.

02:14:49.337 --> 02:14:52.212
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

02:14:54.564 --> 02:14:58.033
So I left Montana on an ol'freight train

02:14:58.034 --> 02:15:01.597
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

02:15:01.632 --> 02:15:09.480
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

02:15:09.515 --> 02:15:11.614
Home I'll never be.

02:15:11.615 --> 02:20:12.615
ON THE ROAD
