00:06.355 --> 00:08.555
Previously, on Shadowhunters...

00:08.590 --> 00:10.557
- It worked!
- Just wait a second, OK?

00:18.235 --> 00:19.568
Hello... father.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.204
Valentine used to take me to
this cabin when I was a kid.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.572
We're too late.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.375
These journals are all
that's left of my childhood.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.543
Jace, this was 10 years ago.

00:27.578 --> 00:30.221
Jonathan died in a fire
when he was an infant.

00:30.260 --> 00:31.359
He's still alive.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.245
No... no... no!

01:05.282 --> 01:06.315
Hey, hey, hey!

01:06.350 --> 01:08.217
Hey! It's OK. Wake up. Wake up.

01:08.252 --> 01:09.384
It was just a bad dream.

01:09.420 --> 01:12.254
Jace...

01:14.491 --> 01:16.525
What... what are you doing here?

01:16.560 --> 01:18.293
I, uh, heard you screaming.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.428
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:19.463 --> 01:21.196
I, uh...

01:21.232 --> 01:23.198
I was back at Lake Lyn.

01:23.234 --> 01:25.334
Underwater. Drowning...

01:25.369 --> 01:27.369
Well, you're all right now.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.139
You know,
everything that happened

01:31.175 --> 01:33.375
back at the lake, I...

01:33.410 --> 01:35.177
I can't get it out of my head.

01:35.212 --> 01:38.786
It's not exactly top on
my vacation list, either.

01:39.169 --> 01:40.282
My brother's alive.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.383
Somewhere out there,

01:41.418 --> 01:44.353
Jonathan... exists.

01:44.388 --> 01:46.255
I know. It's a lot to process.

01:50.294 --> 01:52.561
He was a child.

01:52.596 --> 01:55.163
With demon blood.
Don't forget that.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.498
And no one but Valentine

01:56.533 --> 01:58.545
to teach him the difference
between right and wrong.

01:58.569 --> 02:00.168
If he's out there,

02:00.204 --> 02:01.303
I want to find him.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.238
- We will.
- How?

02:03.274 --> 02:04.634
We don't even know
where to start.

02:07.378 --> 02:10.112
Wait... that's not true.

02:12.483 --> 02:14.116
Do you remember this?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.119
Yeah.

02:17.154 --> 02:19.121
My mom's keepsakes from
when he was a baby.

02:19.156 --> 02:21.223
I mean, we thought they
were yours but they're...

02:21.258 --> 02:22.557
Jonathan's.

02:22.593 --> 02:24.526
We can use what's
inside to track him.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.693
Looks like somebody
beat us to it.

02:41.111 --> 02:43.078
Well done, Jonathan.

02:44.448 --> 02:46.315
You said my mother
didn't care about me.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.150
But she kept these things...

02:48.185 --> 02:49.329
It was foolish sentimentality.

02:49.353 --> 02:52.998
Nothing more.
Your mother feared you.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.490
She wanted you dead.

03:17.381 --> 03:19.147
My sister's different.

03:19.183 --> 03:20.315
Yes. She is.

03:20.351 --> 03:21.594
I'm glad you had a
chance to meet Clarissa,

03:21.618 --> 03:23.418
spend some time with her.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.545
So you're... you're acting
like I'll never see her again.

03:26.709 --> 03:27.709
Of course you will.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.191
You have my word.

03:29.226 --> 03:31.393
One day we will all be together.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.595
As a family. But right now...

03:33.630 --> 03:35.497
Right now,
I need you to trust me.

03:35.532 --> 03:38.066
- Trust you.
- Mhm.

03:38.102 --> 03:39.334
It goes both ways.

03:43.107 --> 03:44.139
I found this

03:44.174 --> 03:45.340
under your pillow.

03:45.376 --> 03:47.242
Force of habit. That's all.

03:47.277 --> 03:49.077
Is it? I'm a wanted man.

03:49.113 --> 03:50.212
I must always be prepared.

03:52.116 --> 03:54.116
Soon, I will no longer
be regarded as the enemy.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.550
I will be seen as a hero.

03:55.586 --> 03:58.320
And so will you.

03:58.355 --> 03:59.521
Isn't that what you want?

04:01.225 --> 04:03.258
Yes. Yes, it is.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.006
Good.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.463
We are going to achieve great
things together, Jonathan.

Dragoniod - www.addic7ed.com.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.268
The Clave is very impressed
with your progress.

04:35.292 --> 04:36.469
They think you're ready
for your first mission.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.059
What do you think?

04:38.095 --> 04:40.740
I've been ready since
the day I got here.

04:40.763 --> 04:42.831
Well then, you better get
your butt over to training.

04:42.855 --> 04:45.022
You know how much our
sister hates tardiness.

04:48.584 --> 04:49.584
Any sign of Jonathan?

04:49.618 --> 04:51.719
No. We tracked the box itself,

04:51.754 --> 04:53.654
But... it was a dead end.

04:58.861 --> 05:01.628
So Valentine sent Duncan to
steal a pair of baby booties?

05:01.664 --> 05:03.464
Someone did. Someone who wanted

05:03.499 --> 05:05.432
to circumvent us from
tracking Jonathan.

05:05.468 --> 05:07.534
And now we have no
leads on either of them.

05:07.570 --> 05:08.669
We've got nothing.

05:08.704 --> 05:10.144
Actually,
we have less than nothing.

05:11.741 --> 05:13.574
There's something
you should know.

05:16.612 --> 05:18.132
The Clave doesn't
have the Soul Sword.

05:18.714 --> 05:19.747
They never did.

05:19.782 --> 05:21.782
So the Clave has been
lying this entire time?

05:21.817 --> 05:23.717
Wouldn't be the first time.

05:23.753 --> 05:25.452
The Clave is trying to
prevent an uprising.

05:25.488 --> 05:27.699
If the Downworld finds out that
we don't have the Soul Sword,

05:27.723 --> 05:29.389
there would be total chaos.

05:29.425 --> 05:30.758
But the sword's
been deactivated.

05:30.793 --> 05:32.626
It can't be used
on Downworlders.

05:32.661 --> 05:34.561
Not in the way Valentine
used it before.

05:34.597 --> 05:35.874
But it's still a
Mortal Instrument.

05:35.898 --> 05:38.499
If you combine it with the
other two Mortal Instruments

05:38.534 --> 05:39.500
the cup and the mirror

05:39.535 --> 05:41.769
he could use it to
raise the Angel Raziel.

05:41.804 --> 05:44.338
I thought that was just legend.

05:44.373 --> 05:45.539
Well, the legends are true.

05:47.376 --> 05:49.576
The Angel will
grant him one wish.

05:49.612 --> 05:51.445
Anything he wants.

05:52.782 --> 05:54.815
The end of the
Downworld as we know it.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.047
How's chasing pigeons gonna
help me with my training?

06:03.692 --> 06:05.759
You're not chasing them.
You're tracking them.

06:05.795 --> 06:07.661
This lesson is all about focus.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.530
Now,
activate your tracking rune.

06:19.742 --> 06:21.809
Now, track this egg back
to the bird who laid it.

06:21.844 --> 06:23.577
You need to concentrate.

06:23.612 --> 06:25.379
I'm already an expert tracker.

06:25.414 --> 06:27.481
I thought the same thing
when I was your age...

06:27.516 --> 06:29.616
until I hit a nest
full of Kuri demons.

06:29.652 --> 06:30.784
If it wasn't for Alec,

06:30.820 --> 06:32.486
I wouldn't be standing here.

06:32.521 --> 06:34.688
But you only got better
by being in the field.

06:34.723 --> 06:36.723
Now... it's my turn.

06:36.759 --> 06:38.458
What are you talking about?

06:38.494 --> 06:40.360
The Clave approved me
for my first mission.

06:42.498 --> 06:43.597
That's not happening.

06:43.632 --> 06:44.632
Find the bird, Max.

06:44.667 --> 06:45.799
That's the assignment.

06:45.835 --> 06:47.801
Where are you going?

06:47.837 --> 06:50.804
You're not sending our little
brother out into the field.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.773
You know better than
anyone how good Max is.

06:52.808 --> 06:54.808
His simulation scores
are off the charts.

06:54.844 --> 06:57.071
That's a simulation.
I'm talking about the real word.

06:57.188 --> 06:58.745
Max has had his rune ceremony.

06:58.781 --> 07:00.514
It's standard to get
orders after that.

07:00.549 --> 07:01.938
Just like we did
when we were his age.

07:01.962 --> 07:03.762
It was different back then.
We weren't fighting Valentine.

07:03.786 --> 07:05.485
- Izzy...
- You weren't there that night

07:05.521 --> 07:07.721
with Kaelie.
He came this close to dying.

07:07.756 --> 07:09.623
Max is a soldier.

07:09.658 --> 07:12.759
It's time we start
treating him like one.

07:20.736 --> 07:22.536
Come on. Fix it already.

07:22.571 --> 07:24.404
You're stalling, Cleophas.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.540
Its destructive powers
have been neutralized.

07:26.575 --> 07:28.575
- Fix it.
- I cannot.

07:28.611 --> 07:30.377
You are an Iron Sister.

07:30.412 --> 07:33.714
And supposedly, one of the best
blade smiths in the Citadel.

07:33.749 --> 07:34.826
Surely you're more than capable.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.450
Or maybe you're
just being stubborn.

07:36.485 --> 07:38.352
Keep pumping me with
your mind control serum.

07:38.387 --> 07:40.387
It cannot fix this
sword and neither can I.

07:40.422 --> 07:41.555
Just inject her, father.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.490
Your daughter did what
no one has done before.

07:43.525 --> 07:45.359
I told you Clary was special.

07:45.394 --> 07:46.660
You leave Clary out of this.

07:46.695 --> 07:48.495
She's smarter than
you'll ever be.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.564
She knows what kind of
monster Valentine is.

07:50.599 --> 07:52.544
Don't let the fact that he's
your father sway you into...

07:52.568 --> 07:54.635
Says the woman

07:54.670 --> 07:56.403
who turned her back
on her own brother.

08:02.897 --> 08:04.544
The Downworld can
still be destroyed.

08:04.580 --> 08:05.980
It just takes a
different approach.

08:07.056 --> 08:08.989
One involving a simple wish.

08:11.274 --> 08:13.207
It's not possible.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.309
No one has been able to
raise the Angel Raziel.

08:16.379 --> 08:18.312
Well...
it won't be the first time

08:18.348 --> 08:19.580
I've achieved the impossible.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.192
Hello.

08:37.534 --> 08:40.068
How can I help you today?

08:42.172 --> 08:43.448
It's a fabulous
shop you have here.

08:43.472 --> 08:45.173
Why thank you.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.340
It's been my life's work.

08:50.346 --> 08:51.909
Absolutely fascinating.

08:52.549 --> 08:55.416
I'm Sebastian Verlac.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.118
Pleasure to meet you.

08:57.153 --> 08:58.319
Elliot Nourse.

08:58.354 --> 09:00.221
Anything in particular
I can help you find?

09:00.256 --> 09:03.257
Uh...
yes, as a matter of fact...

09:03.293 --> 09:04.559
there is.

09:04.594 --> 09:06.327
Hey! What are you doing?

09:07.597 --> 09:10.131
Tell me where the
Mortal Mirror is!

09:39.262 --> 09:40.528
Jonathan!

09:42.465 --> 09:44.365
Stop.

09:50.406 --> 09:52.373
The warlock attacked me.

09:54.644 --> 09:57.345
I had to protect myself.

09:57.380 --> 09:58.479
Of course.

10:02.252 --> 10:04.185
What, you're afraid of me?

10:04.220 --> 10:05.620
I just saved you.

10:05.655 --> 10:08.256
You owe me.

10:23.445 --> 10:24.445
Lost track of time?

10:27.012 --> 10:28.144
I missed dinner, didn't I?

10:28.180 --> 10:29.412
Only by a few hours.

10:32.017 --> 10:34.060
I'm... I'm so sorry. Really.

10:36.188 --> 10:38.188
I just...
it's been so crazy here.

10:38.223 --> 10:39.956
I understand.

10:39.992 --> 10:41.157
I can't believe I forgot.

10:41.193 --> 10:42.926
It's OK, Alexander.

10:43.441 --> 10:44.871
If we can't go to the Cape,

10:45.137 --> 10:46.997
I'll bring the Cape to us.

10:50.969 --> 10:54.204
Lobster tails and champagne

10:54.239 --> 10:57.007
to toast to a successful
Downworld meeting.

10:57.338 --> 10:58.370
Mm.

11:00.145 --> 11:02.012
- It went well?
- Relatively.

11:02.047 --> 11:04.981
But the Downworlders barely
trust the Clave to begin with.

11:05.017 --> 11:07.017
And the Seelie
Queen went on and on

11:07.052 --> 11:09.085
about the Clave being
nothing but a bunch of liars.

11:09.121 --> 11:11.021
That's harsh.

11:11.056 --> 11:12.355
But Luke and I assured them

11:12.391 --> 11:14.135
that now that you are the
Head of this Institute,

11:14.159 --> 11:16.960
and implementing a policy
of complete transparency,

11:16.995 --> 11:18.962
change was on the way.

11:20.399 --> 11:21.965
That's good to hear.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.300
It is, isn't it? Oh!

11:23.335 --> 11:25.068
Drawn butter?

11:25.103 --> 11:26.303
Sure.

11:26.338 --> 11:29.973
♪ Even as we're falling apart ♪

11:35.414 --> 11:38.048
OK, so a group of
Downworlders get together

11:38.083 --> 11:40.050
and a fight doesn't break out?

11:40.085 --> 11:42.118
I don't know.
Sounds like a bust to me.

11:42.154 --> 11:44.988
Seelie Queen's spoiling
for a fight with the Clave.

11:45.023 --> 11:46.496
Well, it's kind of
inevitable, isn't it?

11:46.520 --> 11:48.220
Not if I can help it.

11:48.303 --> 11:49.535
I gotta go.

11:50.362 --> 11:51.394
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey!

11:51.430 --> 11:52.929
I'm heading down to the station,

11:52.965 --> 11:54.042
but if, uh...
you want to talk...

11:54.066 --> 11:56.106
No, I'm all good man.
I'm actually here to see Maia.

11:57.970 --> 12:00.103
Hm!

12:02.307 --> 12:03.940
- Hey!
- Hey, what's up?

12:03.976 --> 12:06.076
How do you feel about boats?

12:06.111 --> 12:08.979
Boats? I can't say I
think too much about 'em.

12:09.014 --> 12:11.890
Well, I reserved us a paddle
boat at Prospect Park.

12:11.992 --> 12:12.949
I know you like marine biology,

12:12.985 --> 12:13.683
so I figured you
might like this.

12:13.719 --> 12:15.218
Also, I know it's not the ocean,

12:15.253 --> 12:18.221
but believe me, there's some
weird stuff living down there.

12:20.425 --> 12:23.159
That's really sweet of
you, but, um...

12:23.195 --> 12:25.161
I can't. I'm busy.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.160
I didn't give you a date yet.

12:29.559 --> 12:30.725
Right...

12:30.878 --> 12:34.137
but I'm working a lot
of doubles this week.

12:34.172 --> 12:36.949
And I've got all this
reading for class.

12:37.043 --> 12:39.109
I just can't.
It's not a good time right now.

12:41.352 --> 12:42.652
Not a good time to go boating

12:42.748 --> 12:44.614
or not a good time to
go on a date with me?

12:47.285 --> 12:50.153
I mean... I had a lot
fun at your family dinner

12:50.188 --> 12:52.188
but... just as friends.

12:52.224 --> 12:54.991
Oh! No! Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:55.027 --> 12:57.579
I totally read that situation wrong.
What else is new.

12:58.964 --> 12:59.964
Is this about Clary?

12:59.998 --> 13:02.065
Because you know that...
that's past tense.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.233
It's not Clary.

13:03.268 --> 13:06.169
And I like you.
I like spending time with you.

13:06.204 --> 13:08.238
But... just as friends.

13:08.273 --> 13:10.240
Right... friends.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.135
Where is the mirror?

13:25.323 --> 13:26.423
I don't care what you do.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.258
I promised Jocelyn.

13:31.063 --> 13:32.626
Loyalty.

13:33.001 --> 13:34.297
An admirable trait.

13:34.332 --> 13:36.166
Until it gets you killed.

13:37.202 --> 13:39.235
She was clever, my wife.

13:39.271 --> 13:40.904
She was up to all
sorts of things.

13:40.939 --> 13:43.907
Hiding the cup, the mirror...

13:43.942 --> 13:45.041
our daughter.

13:47.112 --> 13:48.178
Let's take him with us.

13:48.213 --> 13:50.380
We've got other methods
to make him talk.

13:56.121 --> 13:58.121
What are you doing? What...
what is he doing?

13:59.958 --> 14:01.391
Hey! Stop this!

14:01.426 --> 14:02.959
Stop him!

14:08.133 --> 14:10.033
Do not let him die!
Don't let him die!

14:10.068 --> 14:11.935
JONATHAN, DO NOT LET HIM DIE!

14:16.141 --> 14:17.340
Check his arm.

14:23.489 --> 14:24.722
The mark's gone.

14:24.827 --> 14:26.627
Damn.

14:27.828 --> 14:28.860
Go back to the Institute.

14:28.895 --> 14:30.528
Dig into the archives.

14:30.564 --> 14:32.916
Find out what
happened to that mark.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.899
Now.

14:44.678 --> 14:46.511
Dot, are you OK?

14:47.614 --> 14:48.880
Give us a minute.

14:48.915 --> 14:50.682
I didn't know where else to go.

14:50.717 --> 14:52.629
I didn't know who to trust.
So I came straight here.

14:52.653 --> 14:54.686
- OK. What's wrong?
- Have you heard from Elliot?

14:54.721 --> 14:56.788
Elliot Nourse?

14:56.823 --> 14:59.924
No, not since he quit mom's
shop and opened his own.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.893
Dot, what is it?

15:01.928 --> 15:04.429
I think something
terrible's happened to him,

15:04.464 --> 15:06.306
and I'm worried I might be next.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.813
After Elliot opened his
own shop we lost touch.

15:14.833 --> 15:15.668
But when I was little,

15:15.750 --> 15:17.691
Elliot was one of my
mom's best friends.

15:17.736 --> 15:19.502
He introduced me to Jocelyn.

15:19.537 --> 15:20.648
And now you're concerned
he's in trouble.

15:20.672 --> 15:22.839
The mark on Dot's arm is
part of a protection spell.

15:22.874 --> 15:25.608
It's a sigil.
It only transfers to another warlock

15:25.643 --> 15:26.721
if something terrible
has happened.

15:26.745 --> 15:28.625
Whatever he's guarding
must be pretty important.

15:32.256 --> 15:33.909
It's the Mortal Mirror.

15:34.794 --> 15:37.104
Jocelyn had it?
I know it's crazy.

15:37.155 --> 15:38.287
The mirror and the cup.

15:38.590 --> 15:40.556
I guess my mom knew
Elliot would do anything

15:40.592 --> 15:42.558
to keep it safe. As a warlock,

15:42.594 --> 15:44.494
he could protect it
better than anyone, right?

15:44.529 --> 15:46.755
So she entrusted him
with its location.

15:46.864 --> 15:48.631
And Elliot entrusted it to me.

15:48.666 --> 15:51.467
So you know the current
location of the Mortal Mirror?

15:51.503 --> 15:53.403
Sort of.

15:53.438 --> 15:55.705
These lines coordinate

15:55.740 --> 15:57.607
to specific Ley
lines in the city.

15:57.642 --> 16:00.443
I can figure it out,
but it'll take some time.

16:00.478 --> 16:03.513
We have maps of all the Ley lines.
We can help you.

16:03.548 --> 16:05.615
And we can protect you from
Jonathan and Valentine.

16:05.650 --> 16:07.383
With those marks on your wrist,

16:07.419 --> 16:09.619
it's only a matter of time
before they come after you.

16:09.654 --> 16:10.831
Jace and I will go
to Elliot's shop.

16:10.855 --> 16:13.723
See what happened.
You'll be safe here.

16:13.758 --> 16:15.458
Be careful.

16:25.238 --> 16:26.536
Oh, Elliot...

16:34.881 --> 16:36.114
You see these marks?

16:36.516 --> 16:38.249
A demon was here.

16:40.144 --> 16:41.651
He was tortured.

16:41.686 --> 16:43.686
But this isn't murder.
He killed himself.

16:43.721 --> 16:44.687
What?

16:44.722 --> 16:46.898
How can you tell?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.559
The blood from his eyes,
I've seen it before.

16:49.594 --> 16:51.360
It's a warlock incantation.

16:51.396 --> 16:53.663
It's basically their version
of a cyanide capsule.

16:53.698 --> 16:55.531
I'm sorry.

16:56.768 --> 16:58.501
Hi.

16:58.536 --> 17:00.403
- Hey.
- Sebastian?

17:00.438 --> 17:01.737
What are you doing here?

17:01.773 --> 17:03.706
I, uh...
I saw the alert at the Institute.

17:03.741 --> 17:06.442
Is everything under control?

17:06.478 --> 17:08.444
We're still not 100
percent sure what happened.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.480
There was a demon presence here,

17:10.515 --> 17:11.625
but something doesn't add up.

17:11.648 --> 17:12.748
Oh my God.

17:12.784 --> 17:14.784
It's Jonathan.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.719
How do you know that?

17:16.753 --> 17:18.421
The flowers...

17:18.455 --> 17:20.756
My mom shared a memory from
when Jonathan was a baby.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.392
He'd done the exact same thing.

17:24.729 --> 17:27.497
And that Grey demon ichor,
that's how Valentine described

17:27.531 --> 17:29.632
the aftermath of
Jonathan's childhood kills.

17:30.768 --> 17:32.535
Jonathan was here.

17:34.231 --> 17:36.539
Sorry, who's, uh...
who's Jonathan?

17:36.574 --> 17:38.441
My brother.

17:38.476 --> 17:40.643
He must be after
the Mortal Mirror.

17:40.678 --> 17:43.513
If he comes after it again,
I'm gonna have to deal with him.

17:43.548 --> 17:45.781
What does that mean?

17:45.817 --> 17:47.617
It means I'm gonna do
anything in my power

17:47.652 --> 17:48.618
to protect the mirror.

17:48.653 --> 17:50.720
- You'll kill him?
- If that's what it takes.

17:50.755 --> 17:52.722
- Yeah.
- You don't even know

17:52.757 --> 17:54.423
if Jonathan's doing
this on his own.

17:54.459 --> 17:56.492
He could be under
Valentine's influence.

17:56.528 --> 17:57.689
Yeah, Clary's got a point.

17:57.751 --> 18:01.430
I mean, what if Valentine's
forcing him to do his bidding?

18:01.466 --> 18:03.533
Yeah. OK, look.

18:03.568 --> 18:05.999
I know exactly what it's like
to be manipulated by Valentine.

18:06.140 --> 18:07.637
Probably better than anyone.

18:07.672 --> 18:09.155
You know, Clary,
you read those journals.

18:09.179 --> 18:11.774
Jonathan Morgenstern is
a demon-blooded monster

18:11.809 --> 18:14.189
who is responsible for
the death of your friend.

18:14.236 --> 18:15.578
An innocent warlock.

18:15.613 --> 18:17.547
Remember what
Valentine made you do.

18:17.582 --> 18:19.348
I don't have demon blood.

18:19.384 --> 18:20.483
Just think about it, Jace.

18:20.518 --> 18:22.485
Valentine has
manipulated us both.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.755
What if Jonathan is
just his latest victim?

18:27.792 --> 18:29.659
We don't have any facts.

18:29.694 --> 18:31.827
And until we do,
no one is getting killed.

18:33.265 --> 18:35.498
Yeah, I suppose the, uh...

18:35.533 --> 18:38.301
the priority right now should
be finding that mirror.

18:59.591 --> 19:01.424
Ha!

19:01.459 --> 19:03.559
Surrender to the
Authority of the Clave.

19:03.595 --> 19:05.428
You'll never take me
alive, Shadowhunter scum.

19:05.463 --> 19:07.330
- Huh?
- Dracula's time is nigh.

19:07.365 --> 19:08.731
Nosferatu will rise again, man!

19:09.774 --> 19:12.212
OK. Thank you, Simon.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.534
Too much? Also, ah! I think

19:14.608 --> 19:16.263
I pulled something.
This kid is super fast.

19:16.287 --> 19:17.718
Hey! What did I say
about being quicker

19:17.742 --> 19:18.672
with your rune activation?

19:18.741 --> 19:19.955
And you're dropping
your shoulder.

19:19.979 --> 19:21.078
I'll do better.

19:21.512 --> 19:23.613
Catching Simon is easy.

19:23.648 --> 19:24.658
You make mistakes like this

19:24.682 --> 19:25.726
out in the field
and you're dead.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.750
Well, catching Simon
is not that easy.

19:27.785 --> 19:29.518
And can we have a second?
Is that cool?

19:31.623 --> 19:33.689
Izzy,
we've been at this for hours.

19:33.725 --> 19:35.491
I think it's time
we take a break.

19:35.526 --> 19:37.393
Yeah, Max is fine. OK?

19:37.428 --> 19:38.761
It's not Max I'm worried about.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.534
Who wants chow mein
and fortune cookies?

19:45.570 --> 19:46.736
- I do!
- Yes!

19:59.417 --> 20:00.549
Any luck?

20:00.585 --> 20:02.718
I'm getting closer to
narrowing down the location.

20:02.754 --> 20:05.621
You understand that once
you retrieve the mirror,

20:05.657 --> 20:07.456
it becomes property
of the Clave?

20:07.492 --> 20:09.592
You think I want
anything to do with this?

20:09.627 --> 20:12.595
The only thing I care about
is stopping Valentine.

20:12.630 --> 20:14.630
No, I... I didn't mean to...

20:14.666 --> 20:17.833
I'm sorry, but I've lost
whatever faith in the Clave

20:17.869 --> 20:20.803
I had left.
So when I retrieve the mirror,

20:20.838 --> 20:22.738
it becomes property
of Clary Fairchild.

20:22.774 --> 20:24.640
She's the only one that I trust.

20:24.676 --> 20:26.509
She can do what
she wants with it.

20:26.544 --> 20:28.644
Fair enough.

20:30.197 --> 20:32.481
We've had too many
security breaches recently.

20:32.517 --> 20:34.750
So I'm limiting your
escort to Jace and Clary.

20:34.786 --> 20:35.751
You'll be safer that way.

20:35.787 --> 20:37.553
Thanks.

20:37.588 --> 20:39.422
It's Jonathan. My brother.

20:39.457 --> 20:41.524
He's the one who
came after Elliot.

20:41.559 --> 20:42.758
He's after the mirror.

20:45.109 --> 20:46.109
Sebastian.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.579
Thanks, but we're good here.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.673
If I can be of any assistance,
I'd be happy to help.

20:50.702 --> 20:51.702
Thank you.

20:51.736 --> 20:53.436
But we've got it covered.

20:53.471 --> 20:55.404
Sure.

20:59.094 --> 21:00.843
I've never seen someone
with so much energy

21:00.878 --> 21:02.511
after Valentine's injections.

21:02.547 --> 21:05.414
I'm an Iron Sister.
My blood is purified.

21:05.450 --> 21:07.717
His chemicals can
only do so much to me.

21:07.752 --> 21:10.786
Amazing. My mom used to tell me
stories about the Iron Sisters.

21:10.822 --> 21:12.688
How brave and
powerful they were.

21:12.724 --> 21:14.790
We learn many things
at the Citadel.

21:14.826 --> 21:16.759
Most importantly...

21:16.794 --> 21:18.661
virtue comes at a price.

22:07.745 --> 22:09.578
- What are you doing?
- I took the rooftops.

22:09.614 --> 22:10.780
It's faster.

22:10.815 --> 22:12.815
Clary knows I was there.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.850
Which you?
Jonathan or Sebastian?

22:14.886 --> 22:16.819
Jonathan.

22:16.854 --> 22:18.721
They have a warlock.

22:18.790 --> 22:20.523
She has the sigil.

22:20.591 --> 22:21.724
What warlock?

22:21.759 --> 22:23.425
Her name is Dot.

22:24.896 --> 22:26.762
Jace is trying to sabotage me.

22:26.798 --> 22:28.664
He's trying to...

22:28.699 --> 22:31.634
make Clary hate me.
But I swear to you,

22:31.669 --> 22:33.736
I will end him before
I let that happen.

22:33.771 --> 22:36.438
Listen. Once we have the mirror,

22:36.474 --> 22:37.807
none of this will matter.

22:37.842 --> 22:39.775
I can't have Clary hate me.

22:39.811 --> 22:42.344
Not after everything
I've been through.

22:42.380 --> 22:43.712
Clary doesn't care about you.

22:43.748 --> 22:45.514
Yes, she does.

22:45.550 --> 22:47.304
No, Jonathan. She only cares

22:47.359 --> 22:49.685
about an English Shadowhunter
named Sebastian Verlac.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.821
When she realizes
the truth about you

22:51.856 --> 22:54.790
- she will only despise you.
- No.

22:54.826 --> 22:56.592
You are the one
that she despises.

22:56.627 --> 22:59.662
I am her brother! She loves me.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.399
OK, Jonathan.

23:03.434 --> 23:04.800
You're right. I'm sorry.

23:08.573 --> 23:10.539
Go back to Clary.
Find the mirror.

23:10.575 --> 23:12.641
But remember,
until that's accomplished...

23:14.712 --> 23:16.478
no can know who you really are.

23:26.129 --> 23:28.105
So you're telling me your
sister's still alive?

23:28.184 --> 23:30.229
I don't understand what this
has to do with the Downworld.

23:30.253 --> 23:32.053
Cleophas sent me
this fire message.

23:32.088 --> 23:34.055
It appears that Valentine's
holding her captive.

23:35.091 --> 23:37.892
Magnus, she said he
still has the Soul Sword.

23:38.928 --> 23:40.940
- That's impossible.
- Look, I thought the same thing,

23:40.964 --> 23:42.063
but the Clave lied.

23:43.099 --> 23:44.265
I have to tell Alexander.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.300
Wait.

23:47.170 --> 23:48.347
Alec is Head of the Institute.

23:48.371 --> 23:49.937
He might already know.

23:49.973 --> 23:51.239
No.

23:51.274 --> 23:52.907
I just saw him.

23:52.942 --> 23:55.009
He would've told me if he knew.

23:55.044 --> 23:57.610
He would never keep something
this important from me.

24:00.350 --> 24:01.382
Yeah,

24:01.417 --> 24:03.050
definitely think that's nuts,

24:03.086 --> 24:04.986
that the Clave has
little kids fight demons.

24:05.021 --> 24:07.606
But... you guys are
Shadowhunters, right?

24:07.663 --> 24:08.829
It's not anything new.

24:08.863 --> 24:11.092
I'm still worried.
You know, he's my little brother.

24:11.127 --> 24:13.027
I get it. But Izzy,

24:13.062 --> 24:14.106
when it's all said and done,

24:14.130 --> 24:15.930
isn't this what
Max was born to do?

24:16.966 --> 24:17.966
Like you?

24:19.135 --> 24:21.302
Hey!
Check out my fortune cookie.

24:21.337 --> 24:24.171
You will accomplish
impossible feats.

24:24.207 --> 24:25.172
Yes!

24:25.208 --> 24:26.974
See? I told you.

24:27.603 --> 24:29.002
How 'bout we call it a day?

24:29.083 --> 24:30.111
But it's still early!

24:30.146 --> 24:31.245
Unless Simon's too tired.

24:31.281 --> 24:32.179
What?! No way!

24:32.215 --> 24:33.948
I was just getting started.

24:33.983 --> 24:35.917
Let's get back to
work, young Padawan.

24:38.187 --> 24:39.187
What?

24:39.222 --> 24:41.055
Don't tell me you don't
know what a Jedi is.

24:41.090 --> 24:42.223
Um...

24:43.259 --> 24:44.835
Izzy,
what type of trainer are you?

24:44.889 --> 24:46.005
This is important stuff, man!
All right,

24:46.029 --> 24:48.310
last one back to the boat basin
is an Imperial Gonk droid.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.660
And you don't wanna be that guy!

24:51.034 --> 24:51.999
Hey...

24:52.035 --> 24:53.067
Hey.

24:53.102 --> 24:54.885
Are all vampires this weird?

24:55.041 --> 24:56.137
Definitely not.

24:56.172 --> 24:57.238
Come on.

25:00.741 --> 25:02.574
I don't think
we've actually met.

25:02.617 --> 25:03.617
I'm Isabelle Lightwood.

25:04.948 --> 25:06.191
Are you taking her
on a boat ride?

25:06.215 --> 25:07.915
What? No. No!

25:07.951 --> 25:09.128
No, of course not.
Izzy and I are friends.

25:09.152 --> 25:10.930
We're helping her brother Max
train, and then we stopped

25:10.954 --> 25:11.919
to get a bite to eat...
Stop talking.

25:11.955 --> 25:13.054
That's it.

25:14.190 --> 25:15.923
I will see you later.

25:15.959 --> 25:17.158
Yeah. See you.

25:26.202 --> 25:28.069
- What was that?
- What?

25:28.104 --> 25:29.203
That.

25:29.238 --> 25:30.371
In there.

25:30.406 --> 25:32.306
You and Maia.

25:32.342 --> 25:34.108
There is no me and Maia.

25:34.143 --> 25:36.177
OK, Simon,
you can't possibly be that clueless.

25:36.212 --> 25:37.278
OK? She likes you.

25:37.313 --> 25:39.046
It's obvious.
She doesn't like me.

25:39.082 --> 25:40.667
When a girl likes you
and you ask her out,

25:40.673 --> 25:41.969
most of the time
she doesn't say no.

25:41.993 --> 25:42.993
She didn't tell you why?

25:43.019 --> 25:45.462
No. She just told me
she had a lot going on.

25:46.255 --> 25:48.089
That's your problem.
There's obviously

25:48.124 --> 25:50.151
something more that
she's not telling you.

25:53.096 --> 25:54.273
After the whole
Seelie Court business,

25:54.297 --> 25:56.377
I'm done chasing girls who
only want to be my friend.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.033
I didn't take you for a quitter.

26:01.009 --> 26:03.812
Easy for you to say.
When was the last time you got shot down?

26:03.945 --> 26:06.079
You'd be surprised.

26:06.943 --> 26:09.110
Look, I'm just gonna stick
to things I'm good at.

26:09.145 --> 26:11.979
Like... getting my ass
kicked by a 12 year old.

26:18.121 --> 26:20.099
So you've narrowed it down
to these three locations.

26:20.123 --> 26:23.057
Yes. Here. Here and here.

26:24.227 --> 26:25.259
Wait a minute...

26:25.294 --> 26:27.962
that's the park we used to
go to when I was little.

26:29.132 --> 26:31.032
Mom and I used to go
there when I was a kid.

26:31.067 --> 26:34.144
She'd pack a picnic,
watch me sketch for hours.

26:34.437 --> 26:36.037
It was our place.

26:38.908 --> 26:40.882
She hid it somewhere
I'd remember...

26:41.039 --> 26:42.143
just in case.

26:42.178 --> 26:43.277
It's gotta be there.

26:50.920 --> 26:51.986
Uh, hi.

26:52.021 --> 26:53.220
Hey, Sebastian.

26:53.256 --> 26:56.903
Um... I'm sorry,
I'm just heading out on a mission.

26:56.988 --> 26:58.059
Oh, sure. Yeah.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.127
I actually...
I just wanted to...

27:00.592 --> 27:02.492
make sure you were OK.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.099
I'm fine.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.267
Look,
I saw how upset you were today.

27:08.171 --> 27:10.056
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

27:14.043 --> 27:16.911
I keep losing the people
that I care about.

27:18.014 --> 27:20.948
One after the other.
It... it has to stop.

27:20.983 --> 27:22.283
And you're worried that, um...

27:22.318 --> 27:24.151
now Jonathan's back, that it...

27:24.187 --> 27:25.252
that it's not going to.

27:26.289 --> 27:28.022
I don't know.

27:29.058 --> 27:31.325
I mean, Jace thinks that
my brother's a lost cause.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.327
So...

27:35.031 --> 27:36.031
What do you think?

27:36.999 --> 27:38.966
I mean,
I understand he has demon blood,

27:39.001 --> 27:40.968
I know what he's capable of,

27:41.003 --> 27:42.036
but...

27:44.240 --> 27:45.906
but he's my brother.

27:45.942 --> 27:48.976
- God, that's stupid, right?
- Oh, no. No!

27:49.011 --> 27:51.045
God, it's not stupid at all!
And if there's any

27:51.080 --> 27:52.913
humanity left in him,

27:52.949 --> 27:54.982
shouldn't we at least
try to save him?

27:56.953 --> 27:57.953
I think so.

28:03.926 --> 28:04.992
Sebastian...

28:05.027 --> 28:07.027
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:07.063 --> 28:08.896
That was stupid.

28:08.931 --> 28:11.009
- It's... it's just, I'm not...
- No, no, look, I... I get it.

28:11.033 --> 28:13.100
I just want you to
know that I will...

28:14.103 --> 28:15.903
I'll always be there for
you, Clary.

28:18.107 --> 28:20.051
Whatever you need.

28:46.906 --> 28:49.129
Please don't say you've been
waiting for me all this time.

28:49.153 --> 28:49.970
No.

28:50.006 --> 28:51.872
Just wanted to see you.

28:55.111 --> 28:56.111
Is everything OK?

28:56.145 --> 28:58.078
I thought so.

28:58.114 --> 29:02.707
But... now I'm not so sure.

29:02.863 --> 29:03.605
What's going on?

29:03.660 --> 29:04.985
You tell me, Alexander.

29:05.021 --> 29:06.921
From the day I met you,

29:06.956 --> 29:09.890
the one thing I knew I could
count on from you was honesty.

29:11.093 --> 29:14.128
Absolute, total... honesty.

29:18.267 --> 29:19.366
I can explain.

29:19.402 --> 29:21.135
You knew about the sword?

29:21.170 --> 29:23.003
I just found out. I swear.

29:23.039 --> 29:24.004
When?

29:24.040 --> 29:25.105
When did you know?

29:25.141 --> 29:26.207
Tonight?

29:26.242 --> 29:28.175
When I talked about trust.

29:29.278 --> 29:30.278
Did you know then?

29:32.148 --> 29:33.148
I did.

29:34.951 --> 29:36.083
OK.

29:38.287 --> 29:40.955
Look, I was worried that
if the Downworld found out,

29:40.990 --> 29:42.189
there'd be widespread panic.

29:42.225 --> 29:43.335
It could have led
to a rebellion.

29:43.359 --> 29:45.359
And you didn't trust
me to stay quiet?

29:45.394 --> 29:47.161
I didn't say that.
I didn't want to ask you

29:47.196 --> 29:48.996
to have to keep a secret
from your own people.

29:49.031 --> 29:50.331
That wouldn't be fair to you.

29:50.366 --> 29:51.366
Oh.

29:52.368 --> 29:54.235
You're just like the Clave...

29:54.270 --> 29:56.203
Making promises you
never intend to keep.

29:56.239 --> 29:58.172
- Oh! Transparency?
- Magnus!

29:58.207 --> 29:59.940
Magnus,
let's not make this personal.

29:59.976 --> 30:01.342
How can I not make it personal?

30:01.377 --> 30:03.210
Valentine wants me dead.

30:03.246 --> 30:04.246
He wants all of us dead.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.312
I know.

30:05.348 --> 30:07.314
And after I bared
my heart and soul.

30:07.350 --> 30:10.184
I told you things I've
never told anyone.

30:10.219 --> 30:12.953
You looked me straight
in the eye and lied.

30:12.989 --> 30:14.088
Magnus, I didn't...

30:14.123 --> 30:15.300
I guess it runs in the family.

30:15.324 --> 30:16.324
Hey!

30:17.426 --> 30:19.393
That's not fair. Magnus!

30:36.682 --> 30:38.215
Luke's not here.

30:38.305 --> 30:40.472
And they say Shadowhunters
are unfriendly.

30:41.432 --> 30:43.533
I'm not here to talk to Luke.
May I?

30:49.641 --> 30:51.340
So what does the Clave want now?

30:51.376 --> 30:53.576
Nothing. This is about Simon.

30:53.611 --> 30:55.545
What about him?

30:55.580 --> 30:57.424
Want to know if you're
really not interested in him

30:57.448 --> 30:59.215
or you're just...
playing hard to get.

30:59.835 --> 31:02.102
OK, I'm not playing anything.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.631
And I'm sorry,
how is this any of your business?

31:03.655 --> 31:05.221
Simon's my friend.

31:05.256 --> 31:06.634
He's been there for
me when I needed him.

31:06.658 --> 31:07.658
That's awesome.

31:07.692 --> 31:09.358
But if you don't mind,

31:09.394 --> 31:10.714
I'm learning about
phytoplankton.

31:13.264 --> 31:14.230
Who was he?

31:14.265 --> 31:15.398
Hm?

31:15.433 --> 31:16.632
The guy who broke your heart?

31:17.669 --> 31:19.268
Who was he?

31:19.304 --> 31:21.344
I mean, it's not Jace,
if that's what you're asking.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.338
Wait...

31:22.373 --> 31:24.373
you and Jace?

31:24.409 --> 31:25.641
True story.

31:25.677 --> 31:27.643
It was fun. Nothing more.

31:29.647 --> 31:31.314
But someone hurt you.

31:31.349 --> 31:33.416
Someone who meant a lot.

31:33.451 --> 31:35.551
We've all been there.

31:35.587 --> 31:37.420
Me. Simon.

31:37.455 --> 31:39.455
It doesn't mean you
should stop trying.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.190
Who do you think you are,

31:41.225 --> 31:43.593
coming in here and talking
to me about heartbreak.

31:43.628 --> 31:45.561
You don't know
anything about me.

31:45.597 --> 31:47.363
You're right.

31:47.398 --> 31:49.432
But I know Simon.

31:49.467 --> 31:51.233
And he's smart.

31:51.269 --> 31:52.234
Sweet.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.337
- Caring...
- You think I don't know that?

31:54.372 --> 31:55.616
Hey, maybe you have
it all figured out,

31:55.640 --> 31:57.373
but I lost control once,

31:57.408 --> 31:58.728
and I'm not going
to do it again.

32:00.445 --> 32:02.311
Losing control sucks.

32:03.348 --> 32:04.525
I know that better than anyone.

32:04.549 --> 32:06.349
But it's a hell of a lot better

32:06.384 --> 32:07.744
than never taking
a chance at all.

32:10.488 --> 32:12.126
Nice to meet you, Maia.

32:23.501 --> 32:24.533
Magnus, calm down.

32:24.569 --> 32:25.501
Was he ever going to tell me?!

32:25.536 --> 32:27.236
I don't know.
Look, he didn't tell...

32:27.271 --> 32:28.471
I trusted him, Lucian.

32:28.506 --> 32:29.538
More than anyone.

32:29.574 --> 32:31.374
And this is what happens?

32:36.547 --> 32:38.347
Hey. I know you're hurting.

32:38.383 --> 32:39.448
I get it.

32:39.484 --> 32:40.484
And I'm sorry.

32:40.518 --> 32:41.558
But you gotta settle down.

32:41.586 --> 32:42.652
No.

32:42.687 --> 32:44.487
Now is not the time
for settling down.

32:44.522 --> 32:46.322
Yes, it is.

32:46.357 --> 32:47.490
Alec is trying.

32:47.525 --> 32:50.192
Trust me, he's on our side.

32:50.228 --> 32:51.788
He would never do
anything to hurt you.

32:54.298 --> 32:55.498
It's too late for that now.

32:57.568 --> 32:59.268
The Seelie Queen was right.

33:00.371 --> 33:01.671
We can't trust the Clave.

33:01.706 --> 33:03.572
They've deceived us again.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.608
Only now, Valentine is free,

33:05.643 --> 33:07.276
and the sword's missing

33:07.311 --> 33:09.378
and the survival of the
entire Downworld's at stake.

33:11.582 --> 33:12.615
We need to tell her.

33:12.650 --> 33:15.418
I don't trust her. I never have.

33:15.453 --> 33:17.386
She's the most powerful
person in the Downworld.

33:17.422 --> 33:19.355
If we want to stop Valentine...

33:20.558 --> 33:22.205
we're going to need
the Queen's help.

33:24.328 --> 33:26.262
I'll arrange a
trip to the Court.

34:03.234 --> 34:05.334
You know, Clary, what I said...

34:05.369 --> 34:06.647
- earlier, about Jonathan.
- No, it's OK.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.437
You don't have to apologize.

34:08.473 --> 34:09.438
I'm not apologizing.

34:09.474 --> 34:11.273
He's the only
family I have left.

34:11.309 --> 34:13.409
You may not consider me family,

34:13.444 --> 34:15.277
but I care about you.

34:15.313 --> 34:17.279
Look,
if you're ever in any danger,

34:17.315 --> 34:19.281
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to keep you safe.

34:22.453 --> 34:24.520
If that means Jonathan has to
die, so be it.

34:25.556 --> 34:27.656
Clary! The Ley Line
intersection's close.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.201
It's here. Do you see something?

35:01.225 --> 35:02.258
That's it, isn't it?

35:04.595 --> 35:06.386
That's the Mortal Mirror.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.400
OK, let's go.

35:15.573 --> 35:16.573
Clary...

35:26.317 --> 35:27.583
CLARY, RUN!

35:29.654 --> 35:30.654
NO, DON'T!

35:39.889 --> 35:41.722
You're Jonathan, aren't you?

35:44.568 --> 35:45.634
You're my brother.

35:48.223 --> 35:49.422
You don't want to hurt me.

35:50.099 --> 35:53.067
If you hurt Jace,
that's exactly what you'll be doing.

35:53.762 --> 35:55.870
This is what you came
for, isn't it?

35:57.336 --> 35:59.036
You can take this and go.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.561
Or...

36:02.712 --> 36:05.679
you can come with us.

36:07.216 --> 36:08.415
We can help you.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.187
Whatever Valentine's told
you, it's lies.

36:12.223 --> 36:14.590
Whatever happened in the past,

36:14.625 --> 36:17.192
whatever you've done,
it doesn't matter.

36:20.331 --> 36:22.197
You're my family.

36:32.243 --> 36:33.575
Take the mirror and go, Clary!

36:33.611 --> 36:35.244
No! Not without you!

36:35.279 --> 36:36.289
It's the only way to
protect the mirror.

36:36.313 --> 36:37.279
GO!

36:37.314 --> 36:38.347
- DOT, NO!
- Come on!

36:48.359 --> 36:50.259
You know I'm ready now, right?

36:52.363 --> 36:54.162
I remember holding you

36:54.198 --> 36:56.098
when you were just
a few hours old.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.468
I looked into those little eyes,

36:59.503 --> 37:02.371
and promised I'd never let
anything bad ever happen to you.

37:07.378 --> 37:08.477
But we're Nephilim.

37:08.512 --> 37:10.279
It's our calling.

37:12.922 --> 37:14.583
I'll have Alec put in
a call to the Clave.

37:14.618 --> 37:17.319
Report to the Ops Center
first thing tomorrow.

37:34.505 --> 37:37.472
♪ My regrets are a
chain around my neck ♪

37:37.508 --> 37:39.141
♪ You know ♪

37:41.211 --> 37:43.145
♪ It's torturous ♪

37:43.180 --> 37:46.315
♪ Have some burdens
that I can't let go ♪

37:49.924 --> 37:50.924
Maia!

37:51.121 --> 37:52.220
Hey...

37:53.660 --> 37:54.726
Um...

37:55.292 --> 37:57.326
I know this is going
to be difficult,

37:57.361 --> 38:00.429
but I'm going to ask
you to not to speak. OK?

38:00.464 --> 38:02.497
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
I can totally do that.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.477
I mean, there are times to talk
and there are times to not talk.

38:04.501 --> 38:06.301
And I... right.

38:06.337 --> 38:08.170
You were saying.

38:10.207 --> 38:13.241
I've made my fair share
of mistakes with guys

38:13.277 --> 38:15.277
and...

38:15.312 --> 38:16.623
I was afraid to put
myself out there.

38:16.647 --> 38:18.513
You've had your heart broken.

38:18.549 --> 38:20.449
I guess that's something
we have in common.

38:22.386 --> 38:23.418
This was different.

38:23.454 --> 38:25.354
But...

38:25.389 --> 38:28.190
maybe now I'm ready
to take a chance.

38:28.225 --> 38:31.326
I mean... I guess...

38:32.563 --> 38:34.262
I just need to take things slow.

38:34.298 --> 38:35.464
Sure! Yeah!

38:35.499 --> 38:37.265
I mean, slow is good.

38:37.301 --> 38:38.467
I'm a vampire, so...

38:38.502 --> 38:40.469
I kind of have all
the time in the world.

38:42.439 --> 38:44.072
Do you think...

38:44.108 --> 38:46.241
the paddle boats are still open?

38:48.445 --> 38:50.078
I think so.

38:59.356 --> 39:00.533
If I had known Dot
was gonna do that,

39:00.557 --> 39:02.090
I would've never
left without her.

39:02.126 --> 39:03.203
She knew what she was doing.

39:03.227 --> 39:05.327
Because of her,
Valentine can't raise the Angel.

39:05.362 --> 39:07.496
We are finally one
step ahead of him.

39:07.531 --> 39:09.297
Hey...

39:09.333 --> 39:11.133
she survived Valentine.

39:11.168 --> 39:12.501
She'll survive this.

39:13.537 --> 39:16.405
All this fighting and
bloodshed, but...

39:16.440 --> 39:17.572
God, for what?

39:43.434 --> 39:44.566
Hey, you OK?

39:44.601 --> 39:46.468
It was like my dream.

39:46.503 --> 39:48.470
I was back at the lake,

39:48.505 --> 39:50.272
drowning, and...

39:50.307 --> 39:52.174
there were these two
swords coming at me.

39:58.415 --> 39:59.514
These aren't dreams.

39:59.550 --> 40:01.149
They're visions.

40:02.619 --> 40:05.153
I think it's some
kind of message.

40:19.603 --> 40:20.635
What are you doing?

40:20.671 --> 40:21.536
Hey!

40:21.572 --> 40:23.505
Buddy, I, uh...

40:23.540 --> 40:25.173
Don't... don't mind me,

40:25.209 --> 40:26.374
I'm just looking for...

40:26.410 --> 40:27.275
something for the boss.

40:27.311 --> 40:29.377
How's the, uh... training going?

40:32.282 --> 40:33.348
What's the matter?

40:33.383 --> 40:35.383
I found a single hair,

40:35.419 --> 40:37.486
stuck in the bottom of the box.

40:42.426 --> 40:44.226
You're him.

40:45.295 --> 40:46.461
You're Jonathan.
