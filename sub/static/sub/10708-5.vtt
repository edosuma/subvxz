Karma and Amy will make up, and soon,

00:02.789 --> 00:04.322
you'll be back to being number two.

00:04.324 --> 00:06.357
Karma and I aren't
really friends anymore.

00:06.359 --> 00:08.493
It was a thing, but
it's so not a big deal.

00:08.495 --> 00:10.661
We're both single
again. Maybe it's our time.

00:10.663 --> 00:12.330

- Have you seen Karma?
- She bolted a while back.

00:17.003 --> 00:18.803
You want to grab coffee sometime?

00:22.107 --> 00:23.407
And I wrote this one to you

00:23.409 --> 00:24.909
after the Fourth of July Lifeguard Luau.

00:24.911 --> 00:27.513
I was really missing you that night.

00:27.514 --> 00:29.347
I'm sorry, is it weird
that I wrote you letters

00:29.349 --> 00:30.715
all summer that I didn't send?

00:30.717 --> 00:34.652
I love that you never
lost hope that we'd make up.

00:34.654 --> 00:36.821
To be honest, I kind of have

00:36.823 --> 00:39.357
like 50 angsty
emails in my drafts folder

00:39.359 --> 00:40.791
that I wrote you this summer.

00:40.793 --> 00:41.726
Really?

00:41.728 --> 00:43.194
I'm just as dorky as you are.

00:43.196 --> 00:45.897
Just more environmentally-conscious.

00:45.899 --> 00:48.199
Well, I can't wait to
binge-read them all.

00:48.201 --> 00:50.268
Seriously, Amy, my
dad's brush with death

00:50.270 --> 00:51.869
just made me realize I need to tell

00:51.871 --> 00:53.971
my friends and
family what they mean to me.

00:53.973 --> 00:56.574
There's only one
person in my life who is both.

00:56.576 --> 00:58.209
- That's you.
- Oh.

00:58.211 --> 01:01.479
I feel the same way.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.981
How touching.

01:03.983 --> 01:05.215
Here we go again.

01:05.218 --> 01:06.450
Lauren...

01:06.452 --> 01:10.054
I'll leave you two lovebirds alone.

01:10.056 --> 01:11.822
What's her problem?

01:11.824 --> 01:13.958
Daddy, there is no
way I'm driving to Dallas

01:13.960 --> 01:16.994
to stay in that pizza box
graveyard of an apartment.

01:16.996 --> 01:18.663
You are coming to Austin this weekend,

01:18.665 --> 01:19.764

room, over room service.

01:28.474 --> 01:29.874
Can I help you?

01:29.876 --> 01:32.677
Listen, I know that I have been

01:32.679 --> 01:34.178
non-stop Karma for the past few days,

01:34.180 --> 01:35.780
and we haven't
gotten to hang out, but...

01:35.782 --> 01:38.783
Sorry to interrupt,
girls. Amy, can I borrow these?

01:38.785 --> 01:40.785
I need to project a more youthful image

01:40.787 --> 01:42.753
if I'm gonna get any right
swipes on Hitcher.

01:42.755 --> 01:46.090
I'm competing with 22-year-olds

01:46.092 --> 01:48.559
Maybe you should
just give up and get fat.

01:48.561 --> 01:49.694
I've thought about it,

01:49.696 --> 01:52.663
but I still believe in romance.

01:52.665 --> 01:55.499
And it only takes one
date to meet Mr. Right.

01:55.501 --> 01:58.703
- Or Mrs. Right.
- Whatever. Can I?

01:58.705 --> 02:01.906
- Yes.
- Thank you.

02:01.908 --> 02:03.107
Where was I?

02:03.109 --> 02:05.576
You were implying
that I'm jealous of Karma.

02:05.578 --> 02:06.911
Which I'm not.

02:06.913 --> 02:08.579
I'm just frustrated that you're going

02:08.580 --> 02:10.747
back down her rabbit hole.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.149
Mm! You know what I mean.

02:12.151 --> 02:14.118
[groans] That's not what happened!

02:14.120 --> 02:15.720
Her dad's heart attack made us realize

02:15.722 --> 02:17.555
that we really need each other.

02:17.557 --> 02:19.790
I get it. Best friends forever.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.826

02:21.828 --> 02:23.227
Karma's my best friend,

02:23.229 --> 02:27.198
but you're my sister.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.399
Former sister.

02:28.401 --> 02:29.834
For now. You never know.

02:29.836 --> 02:32.169
My mom has been known to recycle an ex.

02:32.171 --> 02:37.108
Her love life is
tragic, but sustainable.

02:37.110 --> 02:38.909
Amy, that's brilliant.

02:38.911 --> 02:40.144
I thought it was witty.

Karma's dad a heart attack

Why are you suddenly so
eager to have dinner with my Rabbi?

into the Bar Mitzvah circuit.

[sighs]

18:24.428 --> 18:25.695
Wait, are you sure?

18:25.697 --> 18:27.030
Your dad's just in the other room.

18:27.032 --> 18:28.531
What? He gave us his
blessing, didn't he?

18:28.533 --> 18:29.899
It's totally kosher.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.702
- I love being Jewish.

18:32.704 --> 18:35.438
And that's why my band... name TBD...

18:35.440 --> 18:37.474
must play Becca's Bat Mitzvah.

18:37.476 --> 18:39.643
They're a bit pricey, but worth it.

18:39.645 --> 18:41.878
Well, how can I argue with my
favorite Bat Mitzvah student

18:41.880 --> 18:44.180
and the boyfriend of my
best Bar Mitzvah student?

18:44.182 --> 18:45.715
[chuckles] What?

18:45.717 --> 18:46.816
Liam?

18:46.818 --> 18:48.018
We're not boyfriends.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.886
Liam's as hetero as they come.

How dare you?

18:58.296 --> 19:00.697
You said it was kosher.

19:00.699 --> 19:03.266
You need to find a new temple.

[camera shutter clicks]

19:04.469 --> 19:06.870
Mom, Dad.

19:06.872 --> 19:09.939
The truth is, I'm really uncomfortable

19:09.941 --> 19:11.908
with this whole poly-Diane thing.

19:11.910 --> 19:16.279
I didn't want to upset
you, but I have to be honest.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.849
We were a bit surprised you
were so accepting so quickly.

19:19.851 --> 19:21.284
So you'll stop seeing Diane?

19:21.286 --> 19:25.321
Oh, sweetheart.

19:25.323 --> 19:27.023
No.

19:27.025 --> 19:29.092
We appreciate that you're
living your truth,

19:29.094 --> 19:31.761
but we have to live ours as well.

19:31.763 --> 19:36.866
But we don't ask
her to move in just yet.

19:36.868 --> 19:39.803
And we'll make sure to do any
sleepovers at her place.

19:42.106 --> 19:43.940
Lauren, I'm sorry.

19:43.942 --> 19:45.275
I screwed up.

19:45.277 --> 19:46.543
Okay, but I still think...

19:46.545 --> 19:47.944
You can just stop.

19:47.946 --> 19:49.813
Of course you dumped
our plan to help Karma.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.182
I'm an idiot for even
being a little surprised.

19:52.184 --> 19:54.584
I did all that for you.

19:54.586 --> 19:56.252
I catfished my mom, broke her heart...

19:56.254 --> 19:58.288
Do you even want
them to get back together?

19:58.290 --> 20:00.490
Honestly? I don't know.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.659
I don't really care if
Bruce is my stepdad.

20:02.661 --> 20:05.261
But I know that I want you as my sister.

20:05.263 --> 20:06.863
Well, I don't,

20:06.865 --> 20:08.732
not if you're always
going to pick Karma over me.

20:08.734 --> 20:10.767
That's not fair.

20:10.769 --> 20:12.202
Karma and I are best friends.

20:12.204 --> 20:13.369
You and I are sisters.

20:13.371 --> 20:14.771
Stop saying we're sisters!

20:14.773 --> 20:17.273
We're not and we never will be again.

20:17.275 --> 20:19.976
It's over.

20:19.978 --> 20:21.111
I'm moving out.

20:30.822 --> 20:31.855
I was hoping your breakup with Rachel

20:31.857 --> 20:33.356
wouldn't get you down.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.758
She helped me see that
I have zero business

20:34.760 --> 20:35.992
being in a relationship.

20:35.994 --> 20:37.961
So I heard it's a big hook-up fest.

20:37.963 --> 20:39.529
No, no, I'm not.

20:39.531 --> 20:42.432
<i>I'm just going as Karma's wingwoman.</i>

20:42.434 --> 20:44.086
Oh. I was gonna show up.
