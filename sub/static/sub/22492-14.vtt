00:18.944 --> 00:20.844
It's alive!

00:39.198 --> 00:40.028
Ugh!

00:40.098 --> 00:42.032
This food NASA sent up is crap.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.727
Yep, but I got an idea.

00:43.802 --> 00:45.394
Hey, Kool-aid!

00:45.470 --> 00:46.869
Oh, yeah!

00:46.939 --> 00:48.099
Aaahhh!

00:56.648 --> 00:58.206
Yeah, there we go.

00:58.283 --> 01:00.251
I am a potato.

01:00.319 --> 01:03.015
Encyclopedia Brown is on the
case!

01:03.088 --> 01:05.921
Aha!
Miss September has implants.

01:05.991 --> 01:07.117
I swear, Hazel.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.023
I don't know what to do with
that man.

01:09.094 --> 01:11.688
He just won't ask his boss
for a raise.

01:11.763 --> 01:14.231
When I married Roger,
he had such balls.

01:14.299 --> 01:15.698
Where did his balls go?

01:15.767 --> 01:17.029
Dad's balls are missing?

01:17.102 --> 01:18.899
A mystery!

01:18.971 --> 01:20.336
Brown!

01:20.405 --> 01:23.272
You really screwed up these
figures again!

01:23.342 --> 01:24.172
Yes, sir.

01:24.243 --> 01:25.232
Who has shit for brains?

01:25.310 --> 01:26.140
Me.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.041
What's that?

01:27.112 --> 01:28.807
I do.
I have shit for brains.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.744
That's better.

01:29.815 --> 01:32.010
Hmm...

01:33.986 --> 01:34.850
Wow.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.683
I've been a bartender 18 years

01:36.755 --> 01:40.191
and never seen anyone cry actual
tears into their beer.

01:40.259 --> 01:42.352
Kudos, chum.

01:42.427 --> 01:44.190
Thanks.

01:44.263 --> 01:45.992
Mm-hmm.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.008
Strippers always get so mad when
you assume they're hookers.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.408
Well, I definitely am one.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.048
Mm-hmm.

02:04.116 --> 02:05.583
Aha!

02:07.753 --> 02:09.220
You know, in the rest of the
world,

02:09.288 --> 02:11.813
soccer is called
football.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.187
Hey! Hey!

02:13.258 --> 02:15.226
Ow!
Ohh!

02:15.294 --> 02:16.158
What's going on?

02:16.228 --> 02:17.388
Why are you touching...

02:17.462 --> 02:18.292
Hello, there.

02:18.363 --> 02:19.295
What you've just seen is a

02:19.364 --> 02:22.458
dramatization of the new asshole
laws enacted by congress,

02:22.534 --> 02:24.058
which go into effect
January 1st.

02:24.136 --> 02:25.501
It's now a federal offense

02:25.570 --> 02:29.028
to point out that soccer is
actually called football.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.699
Uh, in fact, no "Star Trek"

02:30.776 --> 02:33.438
episode contains the words
"Beam me up, Scotty."

02:33.512 --> 02:34.444
Aah!
Ouch!

02:34.513 --> 02:35.878
Ow! My arm.
Aah! Aah!

02:35.947 --> 02:36.879
Ow!

02:38.383 --> 02:40.977
You know, Iceland is actually
green,

02:41.053 --> 02:43.715
and Greenland is actually
icy?

02:43.789 --> 02:45.552
Aah!
Aah! Aah!

02:45.624 --> 02:48.184
Oh, help me, help me, help!

02:49.027 --> 02:52.121
"Heroes" is way better because
it actually answers stuff.

02:52.197 --> 02:55.098
On "Lost," they don't even know
what they're doing.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.099
What are you doing?

02:56.168 --> 02:58.033
No, wait!

02:59.538 --> 03:02.439
I can't believe we just
survived a nuclear war.

03:02.507 --> 03:03.405
Yeah.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.773
Everyone we know is either dead
or a zombie.

03:05.844 --> 03:08.836
We've got plenty of food, but
most of it's crap.

03:08.914 --> 03:11.849
Oh, you know what would
really hit the spot right now?

03:11.917 --> 03:13.976
Hey, Kool-aid!

03:14.052 --> 03:15.576
Oh, yeah!

03:15.654 --> 03:18.851
Aw, yeah!

03:18.924 --> 03:21.222
Aaahhh!

03:21.293 --> 03:24.319
Oh, yeah.

03:24.396 --> 03:27.365
We are here today to announce
Michael Jackson's deal

03:27.432 --> 03:31.334
to perform exclusively at
Las Vegas' Excelsior hotel.

03:31.403 --> 03:32.335
# Hoo-hoo #

03:32.404 --> 03:35.840
To promote the deal,
we created this.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.637
It's even more beautiful than
I thought!

03:57.195 --> 03:59.823
What the...
What's it doing?

04:04.603 --> 04:06.332
No!
No, stop!

04:06.405 --> 04:07.633
Why won't it stop?

04:07.706 --> 04:08.695
Mmm!

04:08.774 --> 04:09.866
Big boy.

04:09.941 --> 04:12.432
Yes, I suppose it is a good
restaurant.

04:12.511 --> 04:15.036
What do you mean,
"restaurant"?

04:16.680 --> 04:19.309
Encyclopedia,
where have you been?

04:19.384 --> 04:22.376
Mom, I solved the mystery of
dad's missing balls.

04:22.454 --> 04:25.218
See, there they are... right
between his legs...

04:25.290 --> 04:27.019
and in that strange lady's
mouth.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.559
Aaahhh!

04:29.194 --> 04:30.024
Look, Hansel.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.960
I'm dropping bread crumbs to
mark our way.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.327
Our way back to our father

04:33.398 --> 04:35.093
who left us for dead in the
forest?

04:35.167 --> 04:36.259
Whee!

04:36.334 --> 04:38.928
Gretel, you are the smartest
girl I know.

04:39.004 --> 04:39.834
Thanks.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.065
That was not a compliment.

04:41.139 --> 04:42.128
I'm hungry.

04:42.207 --> 04:44.607
Let's eat this house.

04:45.811 --> 04:46.937
Mmm!

04:47.012 --> 04:48.104
Frosting!

04:48.180 --> 04:49.875
I think that's bird shit.

04:49.948 --> 04:50.778
Mmm!

04:50.849 --> 04:52.339
Bird shit!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.247
Children!

04:53.351 --> 04:54.181
Both:
Aah!

04:54.252 --> 04:57.221
You must come inside.
You need a good meal.

04:57.289 --> 04:59.621
# La la-la la-la #

05:02.961 --> 05:06.692
It'll be so nice to have you
for lunch.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.790
Double entendre!

05:10.235 --> 05:11.725
No! No!

05:11.803 --> 05:12.701
Ow!

05:12.771 --> 05:14.238
I'm burning alive!

05:14.306 --> 05:15.432
Why?!

05:16.708 --> 05:18.175
We'll sell more gingerbread
than ever

05:18.243 --> 05:20.643
when my wife is done building
her candy house.

05:20.712 --> 05:22.646
The press we'll get is enormous.

05:22.714 --> 05:25.945
Oh, how she loves making
children happy!

05:27.452 --> 05:30.216
Both: Revenge is a dish best served hot.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.651
The end.

05:32.724 --> 05:36.820
And what was the moral of the
story, baby?

05:36.895 --> 05:38.522
Exactly!

05:38.597 --> 05:40.360
Good night.

05:43.535 --> 05:45.696
And now back to...

05:46.938 --> 05:47.870
Kids!

05:49.374 --> 05:50.636
Kids?

05:51.676 --> 05:52.734
So long, Flash.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.540
You'll have to pick up the pace

05:54.613 --> 05:56.706
if you want to catch
Reverse Flash.

05:58.884 --> 05:59.873
Ugh!

05:59.951 --> 06:01.350
Again with Reverse Flash!

06:01.419 --> 06:04.820
He looks just like me but with
the exact opposite color scheme.

06:04.890 --> 06:05.720
Brilliant.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.280
At least he wears a mask.

06:07.359 --> 06:09.054
Bizarro Superman looks just me

06:09.127 --> 06:12.187
but with a face like somebody
threw up in a ice tray.

06:12.264 --> 06:14.095
Seriously, it looks like someone
shit out kryptonite

06:14.165 --> 06:15.689
and then
put it on someone's face again.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.792
Have you ever seen
Negative Wonder Woman?

06:17.869 --> 06:20.030
Hey, Wonder Woman!

06:20.105 --> 06:21.504
Fuck you!

06:21.573 --> 06:24.599
Now, where did I leave my
visible jet?

06:24.676 --> 06:25.574
Oh, look!

06:25.644 --> 06:26.736
There it is.

06:26.811 --> 06:28.676
Easy to find.

06:29.281 --> 06:31.579
Don't grab her or anything.

06:31.650 --> 06:32.742
I'd grab her.

06:32.817 --> 06:34.682
Grab her till she couldn't
walk.

06:34.753 --> 06:35.583
Booyah!

06:35.654 --> 06:37.121
Ugh!

06:37.188 --> 06:38.951
Aw, man, am I thirsty.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.150
Me too.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.250
Want to know what would really
hit the spot?

06:42.327 --> 06:44.557
Hey, Kool-aid!

06:51.836 --> 06:54.202
Oh, yeah!

06:54.272 --> 06:55.671
Hey, get your hands off me.

06:55.740 --> 06:56.900
I won an Oscar.

06:56.975 --> 06:59.307
Did you?
Huh? Did jew?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.436
Get it?
I said "jew."

07:01.513 --> 07:04.277
What are you looking at,
vag badge?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.878
Take me to rehab!

07:09.754 --> 07:12.552
Yeah, I love sex and
Johnnie Walker.

07:12.624 --> 07:15.218
<i>Paris, I'm actually
Jimmie Walker.</i>

07:15.293 --> 07:16.157
Ew!

07:16.227 --> 07:17.524
I got to get to rehab.

07:17.596 --> 07:20.156
Lindsay, are you okay?

07:20.231 --> 07:21.994
Aaahhh!

07:22.067 --> 07:24.262
Experts are baffled by this
recent trend...

07:24.336 --> 07:27.203
celebrity after celebrity
rushing off to rehab.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.900
Coincidence or something more?

07:29.975 --> 07:32.102
You're all acting crazy.

07:32.177 --> 07:35.772
You're going to expose our plan
to take over the world.

07:35.847 --> 07:37.405
Stop that.

07:37.482 --> 07:40.315
Yeah, something is
Affecting us.

07:40.385 --> 07:41.352
Oh.
Oh, god.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.852
I still taste Jimmie Walker.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.786
Are you consuming enough alcohol
rations

07:44.856 --> 07:47.324
to kill earth's
deadly atmospheric bacteria?

07:47.392 --> 07:48.757
More than enough.

07:48.827 --> 07:50.124
Shaznook!

07:50.195 --> 07:52.356
It must be having some sort of
side effect.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.057
Yeah, look at Lindsay.

07:54.132 --> 07:57.590
You know, 'cause on our planet
she was a neurosurgeon.

07:57.669 --> 07:59.830
So hungry!

07:59.904 --> 08:02.338
Must feed freckles!

08:03.608 --> 08:04.939
Tinkerbell!

08:05.010 --> 08:08.639
Then we need to act now before
the effects get any worse.

08:08.713 --> 08:12.410
Shed your skin and initiate
attack sequences.

08:14.653 --> 08:16.450
Paris, take out Bush.

08:16.521 --> 08:17.783
M'kay.

08:17.856 --> 08:19.153
<i>President Bush.</i>

08:19.224 --> 08:20.054
M'kay.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.285
Britney, return our child king

08:21.359 --> 08:23.327
to the home world for safekeeping.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.795
'Kay, y'all.
Come on, Sean Preston.

08:25.864 --> 08:27.889
Where did I leave that little
baby?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.695
Lindsay, you...

08:30.769 --> 08:31.701
uh...

08:31.770 --> 08:33.294
you, uh...

08:33.371 --> 08:35.601
Guard this coffee cup.

08:35.674 --> 08:37.972
Oh, just do whatever you want.

08:38.043 --> 08:39.772
Hey.
You're not one of us.

08:39.844 --> 08:41.208
No, I'm not.

08:41.279 --> 08:45.238
I just love this uniform and
Team Hatred.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.510
Everyone together now!

08:46.584 --> 08:48.108
Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!

08:48.186 --> 08:50.347
Let's go kill people!

08:51.623 --> 08:52.851
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

08:52.924 --> 08:54.084
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!

08:54.159 --> 08:56.457
Oh, hell, I left your car seat

08:56.528 --> 09:00.430
in the "Skymall" catalog
that I meant to order it from.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.022
All right, sit on my lap, baby.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.091
This will be safe.

09:06.705 --> 09:09.367
Sean Preston,
use your baby wings!

09:09.774 --> 09:12.299
Oh, my...
god.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.607
Ewww!

09:15.413 --> 09:17.347
Well, more where that came from.

09:17.415 --> 09:19.212
Everyone, I'm a lizard!

09:19.284 --> 09:20.751
I'm a lizard!

09:20.819 --> 09:21.808
No, my son.

09:21.886 --> 09:23.547
You're just an anti-Semite.

09:23.621 --> 09:26.488
I want to be a lizard!

09:29.728 --> 09:31.355
Don't touch me, Jew.

09:31.429 --> 09:33.522
Give it up, lizard,
or we'll blow your head off!

09:33.598 --> 09:34.792
Ha ha, you idiots.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.460
Don't you know anything about
geometry?

09:37.535 --> 09:38.729
I'm a lizard.

09:38.803 --> 09:41.203
My head will always grow back.

09:41.272 --> 09:42.466
Check it out.

09:46.277 --> 09:48.541
Take that, President Bush!

09:49.514 --> 09:51.573
What are you doing to my
husband?

09:51.649 --> 09:53.446
You married your son?

09:53.518 --> 09:54.712
Eww!

09:54.786 --> 09:57.880
That's the other
President Bush, you hussy!

09:57.956 --> 09:59.821
That's George Bush Sr.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.257
Read my lips...
call an ambulance.

10:02.327 --> 10:05.854
Nobody messes with my snookums.

10:09.868 --> 10:12.564
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

10:15.974 --> 10:18.204
Ow.
Stop.

10:18.276 --> 10:20.244
Don't try to run now, 'cause
it's coming.

10:20.311 --> 10:22.074
Ow!
Oh, you tricked me.

10:22.147 --> 10:23.341
Here it comes.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.244
Hold on.

10:24.315 --> 10:26.408
Get ready for the sweet release.

10:35.460 --> 10:41.194
From the moment the visitors
drank our alcohol...

10:41.266 --> 10:42.494
they were doomed.

10:42.567 --> 10:46.970
For through a million years of
keggers and beer blasts,

10:47.038 --> 10:49.302
man had earned his tolerance.

10:52.544 --> 10:53.533
Earthlings rule!
