WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.264
Previously onDynasty...She can't just take him.

00:03.307 --> 00:05.353
LIAM: She's his mom.We're not just giving up on him.

00:05.396 --> 00:06.571
Not without a fight.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.182
Potential side effects
are too risky.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.444
If the disease doesn't kill him,

00:09.487 --> 00:10.358
the treatment might.

00:10.401 --> 00:11.924
Maybe we need to do it for him.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.796
ALEXIS:
You want to drug him?

00:13.839 --> 00:15.232
I'm not feeling so well.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.937
Wow, I am sore in placesthat I didn't know existed.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.853
Where did you findthat trainer? Prison?

00:27.897 --> 00:30.073
Wasn't she great?Oh...

00:30.117 --> 00:31.596
She'll be a perfect
fit for the new

00:31.640 --> 00:34.121
Carrington Foundation
Veterans' Clinic...

00:34.164 --> 00:35.644
if we can make it happen.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.341
Oh, we will.We will.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.082
Be nice to have our nameon a building

00:39.126 --> 00:40.344
instead ofin the headlines.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.043
Healthy body,
healthy mind.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.262
Doing good.
Feels nice, right?

00:45.306 --> 00:46.916
Yeah.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.874
I can think of a coupleother things that feel nice.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.615
Hmm, not so fast.

00:50.659 --> 00:53.140
We still have to convince
the hospital board

00:53.183 --> 00:54.967
to give us the
green light.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.534
And most of them
would rather expand

00:56.578 --> 00:58.841
the plastic surgery center
and double the profits

00:58.884 --> 01:00.669
instead of helping
veterans for free.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.279
I am already on it.

01:02.323 --> 01:05.108
Anders has arranged awalk-through this afternoon

01:05.152 --> 01:07.154
with the hospitalchaplain.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.764
Father Kelly.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.374
So he can pray for us?

01:10.418 --> 01:12.985
He's basically run a personalabsolution service

01:13.029 --> 01:15.292
for all the sinners onthe board the last 20 years.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.947
One word from him andthe clinic'll be approved.

01:17.990 --> 01:22.125
It's so sexy when you talkpublic service and Catholicism.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.301
KIRBY:
Ta-da!

01:24.345 --> 01:26.956
It's a waffle... house.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.175
You have way too much time
on your hands.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.654
Yeah, don't remind me.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.395
I have nothing but time.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.963
I have no job, and no boyfriend.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.139
I wish I had some free time.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.141
Ever since the House of Devereaux
teaser dropped,

01:38.185 --> 01:40.578
La Mirage has been slammed.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.058
I have events bookedevery night.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.539
Hmm. Sounds rough.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.758
Maybe you should hire someone
to help you?

01:46.802 --> 01:48.064
That's not a bad idea.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.936
Someone you know,
who you can trust,

01:50.980 --> 01:52.808
who has lots of free
time on their hands.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.115
Okay, Kirby, you knowthat liking to party

01:55.158 --> 01:58.161
and planning a party arenot the same thing, right?

01:58.205 --> 02:00.337
I planned heaps of events
for Femperial.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.472
Come on.Fine.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.169
But just a trial run.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.562
If nothing else,it'll get me through

02:07.605 --> 02:10.434
the Atlantix All-Star Gamefestivities this weekend.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.220
Okay, Culhane has turned intoa really big client for me.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.525
All right?So if you want to be

02:14.569 --> 02:17.049
a professional, you betteract... professionally.

02:17.093 --> 02:21.228
I'm nothing if not professional.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.272
FALLON:
Who cares

02:22.316 --> 02:24.056
if the Van Kirk lawyersare the ones

02:24.100 --> 02:25.710
that did the paperwork toput Connor up for adoption

02:25.754 --> 02:26.842
ten years ago?

02:26.885 --> 02:28.191
Clearly, they're not very good

02:28.235 --> 02:29.801
if he was never
actually adopted.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.195
Look, I want a chance to keep
my son in my life

02:32.239 --> 02:33.718
and this just seems like
the best way.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.372
LAURA:
Our lawyers are also great

02:35.416 --> 02:37.940
at divorce, for down the road.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.289
Oh, the motherof the groom.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.204
Feel free to
skip the wedding, Laura.

02:41.248 --> 02:44.164
I'm sure Liam can find someonejust as cold and unfeeling

02:44.207 --> 02:45.730
to walk him down the aisle.

02:45.774 --> 02:48.864
Oh, well, I will be there,
if only to make sure something

02:48.907 --> 02:50.866
about this event is classy.

02:50.909 --> 02:53.260
You wouldn't know classyif it crawled up...Enough!

02:53.303 --> 02:54.522
Both of you.You're both gonna be there,

02:54.565 --> 02:56.132
so get used to it, okay?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.613
And hopefully Connor
will be there, too.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.267
Liam, I am trying to understand

03:00.310 --> 03:02.486
this sudden fervor
for fatherhood.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.184
You made it perfectly

03:04.227 --> 03:06.403
clear that you would like to
single-handedly

03:06.447 --> 03:07.839
end the Van Kirk gene pool.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.624
I never wanted
kids in theory.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.974
But Connor already
exists, Mom.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.062
And, look,

03:13.105 --> 03:14.498
I'm not asking for full custody.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.239
Just for Connor to stay local,
so I have a chance

03:16.283 --> 03:17.414
to get to know him a little bit.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.415
Are you the lawyer?

03:18.459 --> 03:19.721
Yes. Randall.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.026
And as the lawyer,

03:21.070 --> 03:22.376
I have to tell you
that's not likely.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.160
Although your name's on
the birth certificate,

03:24.204 --> 03:26.989
you signed away your
parental rights before
Connor was even born.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.557
Meaning?Meaning if you want to
pursue this in court,

03:29.600 --> 03:32.037
it will be an uphill battle
and it could get contentious.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.256
No, I'm not dragging Connor

03:33.300 --> 03:34.214
through some ugly fight
in court.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.780
Good.We'll just...

03:35.824 --> 03:38.870
have to find another way to
convince Heidi to stay.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.612
ALEXIS: Oh, thank
God you're awake.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.223
Alexis?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.224
What the hell happened?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.834
You collapsed after the party.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.576
I think it's those herbs
you've been taking.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.665
Your wife tells me you sufferfrom neurotoxicity,

03:50.708 --> 03:52.884
but your toxic metals panellooks pretty good.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.669
Something else made you faint.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.977
Not the turmeric
and bee pollen.Probably not.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.631
You're in good hands
with Dr. Khan.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.242
And I'm gonna be
monitoring you myself.

04:02.285 --> 04:05.810
Yeah, and who's gonna be
monitoring you?

04:08.204 --> 04:11.642
WOMAN : Dr. Irvin
to the cardiographics lab.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.340
I think we need totell Dr. Khan

04:13.383 --> 04:15.124
that we dosed Jeffwith Clompofein.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.082
Why? So you can lose
your medical license

04:17.126 --> 04:18.910
and I can lose my whole
future? No, thank you.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.521
So Jeff can betreated correctly.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.784
Last time I checked,
you were a doctor.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.002
So start doctoring.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.440
You have access
to Jeff's files,

04:26.483 --> 04:28.920
so do whatever it takes
to cover our tracks.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.052
And then cure my husband.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.708
HEIDI:
Connor is in the shower,

04:33.751 --> 04:36.145
but he should be out soon
so you guys can say goodbye.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.190
Say something. Go.I have no idea where

04:38.234 --> 04:39.627
we'll put all of these
toys you've bought him,

04:39.670 --> 04:42.325
but they will certainly make
the flight home easier.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.327
Heidi,
what happened to your plan

04:44.371 --> 04:45.720
to stay in Atlanta?

04:45.763 --> 04:47.722
Oh, that was never a real plan,

04:47.765 --> 04:49.071
that was just
something I said

04:49.114 --> 04:50.942
to see how you felt
about having a kid around.

04:50.986 --> 04:54.685
Well, it-it turns out that wefeel pretty strongly about it.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.165
Would youconsider staying?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.123
Here? Permanently?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.604
I'll pay to relocate you guysto Atlanta,

05:00.648 --> 05:02.432
and help cover
Connor's expenses.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.826
I just want an opportunityto hang out with my son,

05:04.869 --> 05:06.480
not from across the country.

05:06.523 --> 05:10.092
That's really generous, but wehave a life back in California.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.224
And, despite my moment of
temporary insanity,

05:12.268 --> 05:13.574
I am really excited

05:13.617 --> 05:15.053
to get back to it.FALLON: Speaking of your

05:15.097 --> 05:17.795
moment of insanity, uh,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.362
do you want to tell
us what happened?

05:19.406 --> 05:21.712
Where you went? Anything at all?

05:21.756 --> 05:25.368
Um... I stayed with a friend
for a few days.

05:25.412 --> 05:29.459
But I realized almost as soonas I left that it was a mistake.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.157
Aw. And that is so admirable,

05:32.201 --> 05:34.246
but what if your moment
of insanity

05:34.290 --> 05:35.726
turns into a full-time job?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.075
LIAM:Yeah, and wouldn't it beeasier to stay close by,

05:37.119 --> 05:40.296
where you have people readyand willing to help?

05:40.340 --> 05:45.388
Like I said, thank you for
the offer, but we're leaving.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.043
Okay.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.132
Well, we totally
respect your wishes.

05:54.005 --> 05:56.791
I need your help to do somethingdark and borderline illegal

05:56.834 --> 05:58.096
that no one can find out about.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.272
What is it?

06:00.316 --> 06:02.231
You're the expert at taking kidsfrom their mothers.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.276
I want you to teach me
how it's done.

06:12.197 --> 06:15.505
What makes you so sure that
Heidi is a bad mother?

06:15.549 --> 06:17.420
To have one is to know one.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.900
She makes a good point.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.510
FALLON:Heidi basically hid Connor's

06:20.554 --> 06:22.556
existence from Liamfor over a decade,

06:22.599 --> 06:24.993
and then showed up here,dumped him on our doorstep

06:25.036 --> 06:26.255
and took offwithout a trace.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.344
Well, she's no mother
of the year, true.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.346
And I'm pretty sureshe's still lying to us

06:30.390 --> 06:31.478
about where shedisappeared to.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.001
ANDERS:Well, that's something we could

06:33.044 --> 06:34.350
probably find out.Yes, but what if she was

06:34.394 --> 06:36.570
off on a drug binge?Or at a furry convention?

06:36.613 --> 06:39.137
She's probably alreadypsychologically damaged Connor.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.488
Look, family court only cares
about one thing:

06:41.531 --> 06:43.359
whether a parent is fit
to raise a kid.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.143
Alexis had a closet
full of skeletons;

06:45.187 --> 06:47.363
it was easy to prove that
she was an unfit mother.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.931
So we just have to findHeidi's skeletons

06:49.974 --> 06:51.280
and throw them at a judge.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.804
Where do we start?

06:53.848 --> 06:57.286
This is where I make
an excuse and leave.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.595
Look, I'm thrilled
that you came to me,

07:01.638 --> 07:04.424
but I made a promise to Cristaland myself

07:04.467 --> 07:05.903
to be a better person.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.209
And helping you with thisdoes not fit into that.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.385
Unbelievable.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.779
The one time I actually want you

07:11.822 --> 07:14.129
to be your true self,
you refuse?

07:14.172 --> 07:15.347
If you want to be

07:15.391 --> 07:16.784
a better person,
maybe you should start

07:16.827 --> 07:19.047
by repairing your relationship
with your daughter.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.442
No? Hmm.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.009
You take her social media.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.577
I'll make some phone calls.

07:29.361 --> 07:33.148
WOMAN :
Nutrition, dial 1454.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.804
JENNINGS:
Ugh.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.937
Usually when people groan
like that around here,

07:39.981 --> 07:41.983
it's becausethey're learning to walk again.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.029
You okay?

07:45.073 --> 07:47.467
Apparently, I'm the only person
who values my time.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.905
I'm being stood up by
two men simultaneously.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.559
Not smart men, obviously.

07:52.602 --> 07:55.083
You know, maybe you couldtake it as a sign.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.693
Instead of cursingwhat you can't control,

07:56.737 --> 07:59.696
maybe just appreciatewhat's already in front of you.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.656
You mean the sweaty stranger who
doesn't understand boundaries?

08:02.699 --> 08:05.136
Maybe not.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.487
But I do appreciate the value
of your time.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.880
So if I were to offer youa sympathetic ear,

08:09.924 --> 08:11.665
maybe I could get a discount?

08:11.708 --> 08:14.232
Cute. But do I look like
I offer discounts?

08:14.276 --> 08:15.886
Hmm.And I'm not sure

08:15.930 --> 08:17.018
how helpful you'd be, so...

08:17.061 --> 08:18.889
You'd be surprised.

08:18.933 --> 08:22.110
By the advice of a gym rat
on his lunch break?

08:22.153 --> 08:24.155
Mm-hmm.I'm good.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.506
WOMAN :
Ophthalmology attending, OR 1.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.029
FALLON:
I just spent the last hour

08:28.072 --> 08:30.031
deep diving into Heidi's
social media

08:30.074 --> 08:32.860
and so far, the only
skeleton I found is her

08:32.903 --> 08:35.036
unfortunate belief that she
can pull off stretch velvet.

08:35.079 --> 08:37.429
Well, is it possible
she's just a good person

08:37.473 --> 08:38.605
who made a bad decision?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.781
Absolutely not.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.391
Oh, anything?

08:42.434 --> 08:44.698
Well, I was able to find
the address where Heidi stayed

08:44.741 --> 08:45.829
during her disappearance.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.049
I gather it's a
privately owned

08:48.092 --> 08:49.703
farm in the
Arizona mountains,

08:49.746 --> 08:51.487
just a stone's throw
from the Mexico border.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.055
She told me she was staying
with a friend.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.187
Apparently a friend who has
an application pending

08:56.231 --> 08:58.320
to grow and distribute
medical marijuana.

08:58.363 --> 09:02.759
Oh-ho-ho.
That lying little pothead.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.369
Anders, I'd hug you right now,

09:04.413 --> 09:06.589
but neither of us
really wants that.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.158
Up for a day trip?

09:12.639 --> 09:13.727
ADAM:
Excuse me, Nurse?

09:13.770 --> 09:16.599
Would you pull up
Jeff Colby's charts?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.775
I'd like to order acouple more panels.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.690
Dr. Khan was pretty thorough.

09:20.734 --> 09:21.996
He ordered the works.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.258
Yeah, I'd like totake a second look.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.303
He's family, you know.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.609
Of course.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.176
WOMAN :
Dr. Messina, you're needed

09:28.219 --> 09:29.307
in OR 2, stat.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.396
All right.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.051
Did Dr. Khan order a DBS?

09:34.095 --> 09:36.271
Um...

09:36.314 --> 09:37.533
:Here we go.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.405
Oh, no.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.539
KIRBY
We're going all out
for the all-stars.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.106
I'm thinking an adult-size
ball pit here,

09:45.149 --> 09:46.673
a vodka waterfall in the bar,

09:46.716 --> 09:48.326
and caviar on every table,
of course.

09:48.370 --> 09:51.373
That sounds great, but this
is soccer, not the NBA.

09:51.416 --> 09:54.202
And this party is being hostedby the Atlantix, not the Lakers.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.639
We have budgetary constraints.Okay.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.554
So we just keep it simple
and sophisticated.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.382
I'm sure we can keep
everyone happy.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.602
Oh, I thinkit sounds great.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.430
Last year, Milwaukeehosted the party in a field...

10:05.474 --> 10:06.649
in March.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.130
We nearly froze to death.

10:09.173 --> 10:12.002
Well, our event space has four
functional fireplaces

10:12.046 --> 10:13.874
to keep you toasty and warm,
so don't worry.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.050
Get off me. Hey, I know
the owner. Get off me!

10:16.093 --> 10:19.531
Well, as you can see, we also
have top-notch security.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.142
Sam!

10:21.185 --> 10:22.883
It's me, Ramy.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.363
I just got youa huge payday.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.582
Now you're getting greedy.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.757
Get my money by 5:00.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.672
$200,000.It's all here.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.240
Kirby, why don't you

10:32.283 --> 10:34.677
show the commissioner
the, um, VIP lounge?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.114
The V-I...?

10:37.158 --> 10:39.421
Uh, please, come with me,
gentlemen.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.468
RAMY:Get off me!

10:43.512 --> 10:44.513
He's fine!

10:44.556 --> 10:45.906
I told you I knew the owner.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.472
He's good.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.692
How have you been the
last few years, Sam?

10:49.736 --> 10:53.130
You know, while I was in prisondoing time for yourcrime.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.480
ADAM:
You're suffering from acute

10:55.524 --> 10:57.178
liver failure-- that's what
caused you to pass out.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.093
What?

10:59.136 --> 11:00.834
And no one noticed it until now?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.270
The warning signs were atypical.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.401
If Dr. Carrington

11:03.445 --> 11:05.360
hadn't taken a new
look at your file,

11:05.403 --> 11:06.796
we may not have caught itso soon-- you're lucky.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.276
That's not the word I'd use.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.494
ADAM: Well, the
good news is

11:09.538 --> 11:11.235
if we can find you a donor,

11:11.279 --> 11:13.585
a liver transplant
will save your life.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.849
And the bad news?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.720
You have an incredibly
rare tissue type.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.374
Finding a donor on the
public transplant list

11:19.417 --> 11:21.245
will benext-to-impossible.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.031
But, if we can find a match
from a family member,

11:24.074 --> 11:25.467
we could do
a living transplant.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.208
Livers regenerate,

11:27.251 --> 11:28.688
so if someone's a match,
we can take a piece

11:28.731 --> 11:30.167
of theirs
and grow you a new one.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.387
I'd give you a piece
of my liver if I could.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.997
I'll leave you
to talk things through.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.260
WOMAN :
Hospital transport

11:36.304 --> 11:37.348
to vascular imaging...

11:37.392 --> 11:40.047
Tell me something, Doctor.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.831
Why were you taking
another look at my file?

11:41.875 --> 11:43.746
What did you do to me?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.183
This has your fingerprintsall over it.I...

11:47.315 --> 11:48.838
Look, I'm not playing
around here.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.930
He gave you Clompofein.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.192
Mother.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.803
What?! What the hell is that?

11:56.846 --> 11:58.848
It's the experimental cure
Alexis mentioned.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.024
I, I was actually trying
to save your life, Jeff.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.939
By putting me back
in the hospital?

12:02.983 --> 12:04.375
That wasn't part of the plan--
the side effects were

12:04.419 --> 12:06.116
a little worse than expected.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.248
You haveto understand...

12:07.291 --> 12:09.772
No, I don't "have to" anything.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.079
Remember that little
confessional you filmed?

12:12.122 --> 12:14.472
There's a copy of it
at my lawyer's office

12:14.516 --> 12:16.387
with instructions
to give it to the police

12:16.431 --> 12:17.998
if I die unexpectedly.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.349
So, unless you want to spendthe rest of your life in prison,

12:21.392 --> 12:23.438
find a way to get me better.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.272
What are you doing here, Ramy?

12:31.315 --> 12:32.795
Where else was I
supposed to go?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.231
I just got released yesterday,

12:34.275 --> 12:35.755
and you're the only person
I know in Georgia.

12:35.798 --> 12:36.799
Well, I'm glad you're out.

12:36.843 --> 12:37.800
What's your plan?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.193
I'm not sure.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.847
I can't go to my brother's
until next week,

12:40.890 --> 12:42.413
so I was thinking

12:42.457 --> 12:44.764
maybe I could, uh, crash here

12:44.807 --> 12:46.635
for a minute.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.898
Um, yes. Of course.

12:48.942 --> 12:49.986
Front desk will find

12:50.030 --> 12:51.248
you a room--
I'll take care of it.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.250
Thank you.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.991
:You're welcome.

12:58.690 --> 12:59.779
Who's the vagrant?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.868
I don't know what that means.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.783
He's my friend, Ramy Crockett.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.914
He's gonna be staying here

13:04.958 --> 13:05.872
for a couple of days.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.003
"Ramy"?

13:07.047 --> 13:08.831
As in the guy
who robbed the manor?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.790
It's a lot more complicated
than that.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.835
Okay, well, I hope it's
not too complicated to keep

13:12.879 --> 13:15.098
a convicted felon away
from the millionaire athletes

13:15.142 --> 13:17.187
that are gonna be here
for tomorrow's party.Kirby?

13:17.231 --> 13:19.450
You worry about the party,
I'll worry about Ramy.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.366
ADAM:
I was able to find

13:22.410 --> 13:24.847
most of Jeff's relatives already

13:24.891 --> 13:25.935
in the hospital database.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.416
And I ran their DNA
against Jeff's,

13:28.459 --> 13:30.200
even Blake's.And?

13:30.244 --> 13:31.636
The only person

13:31.680 --> 13:33.334
that's a match is...

13:33.377 --> 13:34.814
me.
Really?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.641
Well, that's great news--
we need to tell Jeff.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.905
Except I can't donate.Why not?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.820
When my... adoptive mom

13:40.863 --> 13:43.910
was sick, I gave part
of my liver to save her,

13:43.953 --> 13:45.607
which is whyI recognized

13:45.650 --> 13:47.130
the early warning signs in Jeff.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.610
Why can't you donate again?

13:48.653 --> 13:50.699
You said livers
regenerate.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.875
They do, but the chances
of a donor

13:52.919 --> 13:56.270
surviving a second transplant
are incredibly low.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.012
It could kill me.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.362
However...

14:02.929 --> 14:04.495
...there's a terminal patient
at the hospital,

14:04.539 --> 14:06.889
who is a potential match.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.500
He's being taken offlife support any day now.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.720
But he's not a registered donor.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.375
You mean he's not
a registered donor...

14:14.418 --> 14:15.855
yet.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.089
Hmm, pretty poshfor a pot farm.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.612
"The Cleansing
Moon Ranch."

14:34.656 --> 14:35.918
What is this place?

14:35.962 --> 14:36.919
Maybe it's another cult.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.442
WOMAN:Namaste!

14:38.486 --> 14:41.837
You are just in time
for our sunrise circle.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.752
Did you get your jade kegel
welcome egg?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.580
Uh, no.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.278
But I have a bunch at home
in my fridge, so I'm good.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.889
Okay, well,as I'm sure

14:49.932 --> 14:53.501
you know, this is
an exclusive female-only

14:53.544 --> 14:54.632
wellness retreat.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.460
Um, we were hoping
you could tell us

14:56.504 --> 14:58.941
what kind of wellness
you practice here exactly?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.944
Because we heard rumors
of, um, well, drugs.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.990
Oh, that's our cotenants,
not us.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.208
We useHimalayan salts

15:05.252 --> 15:07.080
to reset hormonal planes,

15:07.123 --> 15:08.995
practice orgasmic meditation...

15:09.038 --> 15:10.910
"Orgasmic"?Meditation.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.389
It's life-changing.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.957
We were actually just hoping
we can get a quick tour.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.089
My friend Heidi was

15:16.132 --> 15:17.873
here recently and
she cannot stop

15:17.917 --> 15:19.831
raving about this place, um...

15:19.875 --> 15:21.659
orgasmically.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.052
Huh.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.880
Seemed like she couldn't
get out of here fast enough.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
Really?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.317
She spent our entire

15:27.361 --> 15:28.971
nut milk foraging trip
searching for a signal,

15:29.015 --> 15:31.713
so she could call her son.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.236
She really just needed
a psychic tune-up.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.238
Yeah.

15:35.282 --> 15:36.805
Well, don't we all?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.069
Blake, where are you?

15:40.113 --> 15:41.636
Well, currently,
we're about 20,000 feet

15:41.679 --> 15:43.594
over the Texas/Arkansas border.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.074
We'll be home soon.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.597
Look, honey, I told you.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.948
When Fallon came to me for help,I couldn't say no.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.427
I understand how important

15:50.471 --> 15:52.038
repairing your relationship
with Fallon is,

15:52.081 --> 15:53.474
but I'm having issues, too.

15:53.517 --> 15:54.997
The church finally e-mailed,

15:55.041 --> 15:57.913
asking if I can meet thechaplain at the PT center today.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.393
Great, what's the problem?

15:59.436 --> 16:01.264
You're the one who's got
a relationship with this guy.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.353
Well, you're the one that has
the relationship with God.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.007
If anyone can convince

16:05.051 --> 16:06.443
Father Kelly to sway
the board members,

16:06.487 --> 16:08.097
it's a good Catholic girl
like you.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.925
So you're already
blowing this off?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.102
Honey, I promise you, I'm still100% committed to our mission.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.408
Call me when you're
out of your meeting.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.366
I love you.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.196
Trouble in paradise?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.024
No, we're fine.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.200
So, what do you think?

16:24.244 --> 16:25.897
Why didn't Heidijust say

16:25.941 --> 16:28.422
she was at that...
whatever it was?

16:28.465 --> 16:31.555
Well, maybe she was embarrassedby the orgasmic meditation.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.775
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.345
Your mission, not Heidi's...
you know.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.086
Oh, we're not done.

16:40.129 --> 16:43.306
Fallon, there areno skeletons in Heidi's closet,

16:43.350 --> 16:45.743
just jade eggs.Hmm.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.094
And Cristal needs my help
with this clinic.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.531
Great, you two can go
and save the world

16:50.574 --> 16:52.533
all you want after we do this.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.664
Do what?

16:53.708 --> 16:55.362
Well, we couldn't
find any skeletons

16:55.405 --> 16:57.581
in Heidi's closet, so...

16:57.625 --> 16:59.366
we're gonna have
to go buy some bones

16:59.409 --> 17:00.845
and build our own.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.506
Uh, excuse me?

17:09.550 --> 17:10.899
Do you know
Father Kelly?

17:10.942 --> 17:12.074
Uh, of course.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.815
Great, have you
seen him around?

17:13.858 --> 17:15.643
I was supposed to meet
with him ten minutes ago.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.166
I haven't seen him
around lately.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.559
He retired last week.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.518
Uh, but the church office
e-mailed me this morning

17:21.562 --> 17:24.086
to confirm my meeting
with the hospital chaplain?

17:24.130 --> 17:26.045
Mm-hmm, um...

17:26.088 --> 17:27.176
Oh, then you should
talk with him.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.135
That's Father Collins.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.180
Father... Collins.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.575
Thanks.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.838
There's no chance
he's calling you that

17:36.881 --> 17:38.840
because he's your
son, is there?I'm afraid

17:38.883 --> 17:40.624
the only children
I'm responsible for

17:40.668 --> 17:41.756
are the children of God.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.019
You're the new hospital priest?Mm-hmm.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.499
Why didn't you
tell me yesterday?

17:45.542 --> 17:47.414
Before or after
you called me a gym rat

17:47.457 --> 17:48.850
with a lack of boundaries?

17:48.893 --> 17:50.895
I'm sorry

17:50.939 --> 17:52.636
about that.
I'm just a little

17:52.680 --> 17:53.898
anxious about this program

17:53.942 --> 17:55.465
and I was counting
on Father Kelly's help

17:55.509 --> 17:56.771
with the board.Mm.

17:56.814 --> 17:57.946
But...

17:57.989 --> 18:00.122
maybe the two of us
could sit down

18:00.166 --> 18:01.428
for a coffee and

18:01.471 --> 18:03.430
discuss a mutually
beneficial arrangement?

18:03.473 --> 18:04.474
My treat?

18:04.518 --> 18:06.172
I'm sorry, I'm really

18:06.215 --> 18:07.347
not that kind of a priest.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.436
That kind of a...?Unlike my predecessor,

18:09.479 --> 18:10.567
I really don't think
that the clergy

18:10.611 --> 18:12.134
has any place
in hospital politics.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.657
And that's...

18:13.701 --> 18:17.096
no matter how enticing
the, uh, bribe may be.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.837
I-- No, that's not what I...Don't worry.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.361
From what I've seen,
I have no doubt

18:21.404 --> 18:22.971
that you can hold your own
with those guys.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.458
I have a proposal
for you.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.286
And not an
"uproot your whole life

18:33.329 --> 18:35.288
and stay in Atlanta"
proposal-- a fun one.

18:35.331 --> 18:38.073
Okay.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.640
Since Connor and Liam are doing

18:39.683 --> 18:41.555
their little guys' night out
at the arcade,

18:41.598 --> 18:44.601
I was thinking we could
have our very own

18:44.645 --> 18:46.777
moms' night out.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.650
Um, wow, that's really sweet.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.130
Ah...But we've got an early
flight tomorrow.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.697
And, as far as I know,
you're not actually a mom.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.308
Well, not technically, no.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.354
But parenting is hard.
I mean, I only did it

18:58.398 --> 19:00.530
for two days and I feel
like I needed a vacation.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.141
Uh, but the point isstarting tomorrow,

19:02.184 --> 19:04.534
you go back to being
a single mom

19:04.578 --> 19:06.536
full-time, so...

19:06.580 --> 19:07.972
I don't know,
I just thought tonight

19:08.016 --> 19:09.931
we can go a little crazy,
live a little.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.237
What do you say?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.499
That actually sounds
like a lot of fun.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.329
I'm so sorry,

19:16.372 --> 19:18.200
but I wouldn't be doingmy job as a physician

19:18.244 --> 19:20.420
if I didn't ask you this.

19:20.463 --> 19:23.423
I know your husbandisn't a registered donor,

19:23.466 --> 19:26.513
but he has the uniqueopportunity to save a life.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.341
I have a patientwho probably won't make it

19:28.384 --> 19:29.820
through the nightwithout his help.

19:29.864 --> 19:30.908
I'm sorry, but...

19:30.952 --> 19:32.388
ALEXIS:
Dr. Carrington, is this her?

19:32.432 --> 19:35.217
The woman who is goingto save my husband?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.653
Alexis Colby.

19:36.697 --> 19:39.395
I am eternally gratefulto you and your dear husband.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.571
I'm sorry, but as I was
about to tell the doctor,

19:41.615 --> 19:43.530
organ donation
is banned in our church.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.009
We believe
that the soul

19:45.053 --> 19:47.882
does not remain intactif the body isn't fully intact.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.449
Well, that doesn'teven make any sense.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.494
What about veteranswho lose a leg?

19:51.538 --> 19:52.843
Or someone who hastheir appendix out?

19:52.887 --> 19:54.454
My ears are pierced.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.933
Am I going to hell?

19:55.977 --> 19:58.458
I will not sacrifice my
husband's soul for a stranger.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.459
Now, if you'll excuse me.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.591
Of course, come on.

he'll just have to forgive us.

20:08.903 --> 20:12.863
Maurice Perry doesn't need his
liver in the next life, so...

Shoot. I just realized I
left my phone in my room.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.017
Do you think
you could grab

22:03.060 --> 22:04.714
the car and meet me
at the back entrance?

22:04.758 --> 22:06.760
It's way closer

Okay, thank you.

Ms. Carrington?

Oh, uh, that's me.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.954
Once Maurice passes, the
hospital chaplain will escort

22:26.997 --> 22:29.913
the widow to the chapel
for bereavement counseling.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.741
After that, we'll have, like,
five minutes with the body

transport shows up.

No, it'll only take a minute.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.769
Your father and
I are taking

23:42.812 --> 23:44.553
a proposal for a veterans'
clinic to the board next week.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.468
And I know things

23:46.512 --> 23:48.644
between us haven't been
great, but we could really

23:48.688 --> 23:49.776
use your support.

23:49.819 --> 23:52.256
As a new
board member.Yeah, sure.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.128
Did you even hear a word I said?

23:54.171 --> 23:55.651
Got to be honest, not really.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.479
The veterans' clinic.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.002
Right. Yes, that. Um...

23:59.046 --> 24:00.656
Look, I've got
much bigger things

24:00.700 --> 24:02.266
to think about right now
than your clinic,

24:02.310 --> 24:04.704
so unless you want me
to block the vote outright,

24:04.747 --> 24:06.619
I suggest you let me
get back to work.

24:08.534 --> 24:09.839
Thank you.No, thank you. It's no problem.

Leave me a message.

24:38.259 --> 24:41.044

I've been driving in circles

24:41.088 --> 24:42.350
and I'm pretty sure
there's no back entrance.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.702
Oh, no.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.318
Get out of the
car, slowly.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.496
Hi, there. This is my friend's
car, I'm just picking her up.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.323
Out of the car.

24:59.367 --> 25:02.457
Hands where I can
see them, now.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.376
Officer, there must besome sort of mix-up.

25:08.419 --> 25:11.031
My friend asked meto get her car from the valet.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.642
If I could just call her,she-she'll tell you everything.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.252
We spoke to the valet.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.907
This car was stolen directly
from the hotel's parking lot.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.175
Well?

25:25.219 --> 25:26.786
They didn't find
anything in your room.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.614
I am so sorry.I shouldn't have...

25:29.702 --> 25:31.834
We shouldn't havejumped to conclusions.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.358
I suppose we all make mistakes.

25:34.402 --> 25:35.925
Look, don't even
worry about it, okay?

25:35.969 --> 25:37.579
I just hope you find this guy.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.582
Or at least the watch.

25:44.630 --> 25:45.848
Just because they didn't
find it in his room

25:45.892 --> 25:47.458
doesn't mean he didn't
stash it somewhere.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.156
Kirby. You're my temporary
event coordinator,

25:49.199 --> 25:50.374
not my head of security.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.420
Stay in your lane.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.208
I take it that means
the watch hasn't showed up?

25:58.252 --> 26:01.603
No. I'm really sorry,Michael.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.953
If it makes you feel any better,I'm pretty sure my temporary job

26:03.997 --> 26:06.129
is about to turn into
a permanent leave of absence.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.957
Well, that'd be a shame.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.959
Stolen watch aside,
you did a great job.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.266
Thanks.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.137
Hey, so does this meanwe can be friends again?

26:14.181 --> 26:15.617
Sounds good to me.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.794
Great. So, can I ask youa question, as a friend?

26:18.838 --> 26:20.013
Of course.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.797
Vanessa and her mother?

26:21.841 --> 26:24.887
That's not a question.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.976
I followed the techto the morgue,

26:27.020 --> 26:29.326
but by the time I managedto get alone with the cadaver,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.111
the liver was useless.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.505
What about other hospitals?

26:34.549 --> 26:37.421
I've checked every hospitalbetween here and Chicago.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.423
There's no one else.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.991
We're out of miracles.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.342
Can you tell Jeff?

26:49.695 --> 26:51.435
Where have you been?

26:51.479 --> 26:53.220
And why are you dressed
like a doorman?

26:53.263 --> 26:56.179
Uh, a valet. It's a long story.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.224
I've got time.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.834
Oh, the details
are not important.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.532
It's been three days,and you're already lying to me?

27:01.576 --> 27:03.839
What happened to trying
to be a better person?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.667
Because I'm pretty sure
you didn't spend the night

27:05.711 --> 27:07.016
parking cars
for the less-fortunate.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.932
Well, if you must know,
I was helping Fallon

27:09.976 --> 27:10.890
rescuean innocent child

27:10.933 --> 27:12.500
caught in the middle

27:12.543 --> 27:13.849
of a really ugly custody battle.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.155
Oh, yeah?Mm-hmm.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.330
What kind of custody battle

27:16.373 --> 27:17.766
is happening at 10:00 p.m.,

27:17.810 --> 27:19.028
at a valet stand?

27:20.769 --> 27:22.553
That's what I thought.

27:22.597 --> 27:25.556
While you were dropping
everything to rescue Fallon,

27:25.600 --> 27:27.907
our charity program
was collapsing.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.430
W-What are you talking about?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.040
Father Kelly is gone.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.216
And the new priest has
no interest in helping.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.915
Oh, and your other
child has also proven

27:35.958 --> 27:37.525
to be no help yet again.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.309
And you're blaming me

27:39.353 --> 27:40.702
for Adam's feelings?

27:40.746 --> 27:43.574
I blame you for letting himhave that board seat.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.142
And myself for believingthat you were capable of change.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.363
Take a look in the mirror,
Cristal.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.017
You fought to have
Adam kicked out

27:51.060 --> 27:52.845
of the family corporation.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.803
You tried to have him banished
to some institution

27:54.847 --> 27:56.022
when he went blind.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.719
You tricked him
into thinking

27:57.763 --> 28:00.026
that I slept
with his girlfriend.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.549
Maybe if you'd worked
a little harder

28:01.592 --> 28:03.029
trying to be a good stepmother,

28:03.072 --> 28:05.684
we wouldn't be
here right now.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.424
You are right.

28:07.468 --> 28:09.209
I did those awful things.

28:09.252 --> 28:13.039
The difference between us is Iam trying to atone for my sins.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.617
It's late.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.707
Uh, yeah, I know.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.057
More bad news?

28:33.450 --> 28:34.887
We couldn't find a donor.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.976
No one in your familywas a match.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.281
Okay.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.848
So where does that leave us?

28:39.892 --> 28:42.024
Well, it probably leaves me
going to jail.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.852
You're already showing

28:43.896 --> 28:47.638
symptoms of early-stage
liver failure.

28:47.682 --> 28:50.598
And once that starts
to progress, there's,

28:50.641 --> 28:52.034
there's no coming back.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.734
How long do I have?

28:55.777 --> 28:56.909
My best guess?

28:56.952 --> 28:58.519
Two or three days

28:58.562 --> 29:01.087
before neurological functions
start to diminish.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.747
Is-is there someoneI can call, or...?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.792
No.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.708
Would you want your family
to remember you like this?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.623
Your friends?

29:15.666 --> 29:18.887
I don't want to putthe people I love through that.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.066
But I, uh,
I do want to make sure

29:24.110 --> 29:26.373
everyone's taken care of
after I'm gone.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.333
Would you, uh, do me a favor

29:30.377 --> 29:33.293
and write down
some things for me?

29:42.128 --> 29:44.608
Stashed inside the curtain rod.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.742
Did you think I'd forget
my own trick?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.657
Sam, listen, I'm-I'm sorry.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.225
Look, I didn't want to embarrassyou in front of the others,

29:52.268 --> 29:54.227
but I can't riskmy hotel's reputation.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.142
You need to leave.Come on, okay?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.404
Look, I-I made a mistake.

29:57.447 --> 29:58.666
Ramy, I trusted you.

29:58.709 --> 29:59.928
I gave youa place to stay,

29:59.972 --> 30:01.974
and this is how you thank me?

30:02.017 --> 30:03.758
Man, you're lucky

30:03.802 --> 30:06.761
I'm not calling your P.O.Well, go ahead and call him.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.850
I-I'll be back in jail
soon enough, right? Why wait?

30:09.895 --> 30:11.853
Stop, man. Don't say that.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.202
No, it's true.
And then I get a chance

30:13.246 --> 30:14.987
to see all over again
that no one cares.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.252
I'm sorry I didn't visit.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.775
I just,

30:20.819 --> 30:22.472
it would have been weird.Right.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.692
Because had I opened my mouth
to the police back then,

30:24.735 --> 30:25.954
then you could've
been in there with me.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.564
And then you would'vehad a chance to see

30:27.608 --> 30:29.479
who your real friends are,besides me.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.918
Look, you have no ideawhat it was like in there, Sam.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.354
But I don't want to go back.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.574
Give me another chance.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.623
But you will be watched.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.674
Fallon, Heidi.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.981
Is everything okay?

30:53.025 --> 30:56.202
Uh, not really.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.681
Heidi jacked a Tesla tonight.

30:57.725 --> 30:58.769
HEIDI:That is not what...

30:58.813 --> 31:00.206
And thank God the
Carrington name

31:00.249 --> 31:02.077
still carries some weight,
because otherwise,

31:02.121 --> 31:04.471
your thieving baby mama
would be behind bars.

31:04.514 --> 31:07.300
I told you it was a mistake.
Why won't you believe me?

31:07.343 --> 31:08.736
Okay, well, you know what?

31:08.779 --> 31:11.173
Doesn't really matter
what I believe.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.219
I just wonder how a
family court judge

31:13.262 --> 31:16.526
will look upon
a single mother with a record

31:16.570 --> 31:18.789
of erratic behavior
and auto theft.

31:20.356 --> 31:21.923
You set me up.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.533
The valet,

31:23.577 --> 31:25.187
saying there was
a back entrance to the hotel,

31:25.231 --> 31:26.188
it was all you.

31:27.842 --> 31:30.540
Liam,
I didn't do anything wrong.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.802
You believe me, right?

31:33.152 --> 31:35.197
Of course I do.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.765
Who do you think swiped
the keys from valet?

31:37.808 --> 31:40.202
FALLON:
And frankly, Heidi,

31:40.246 --> 31:43.379
the auto theft combined with
your little getaway

31:43.423 --> 31:45.816
on the Vaginal Mystery Tour
won't look great.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.209
LIAM: Look, this
can all go away,

31:47.253 --> 31:50.560
we just need you to agree
to a couple of things.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.954
Like relocating to Atlanta.

31:52.998 --> 31:56.915
Why are you doing this?Because I can't lose my son
for a second time.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.529
Okay. Or we can just settle thisin front of a judge.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.052
No, you don't understand.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.968
It is not that simple.But it can be.

32:07.012 --> 32:10.058
You used to be a kind person,
Heidi. What happened?

32:10.102 --> 32:11.973
I don't know
why you won't compromise.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.235
Is there something wrong
with a father

32:13.279 --> 32:15.411
wanting to get to know his son?No, but...

32:16.673 --> 32:18.414
Connor's not your son.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.201
I had an affair
with your father.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.334
Connor's your brother.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.390
Senior year,

32:37.433 --> 32:41.307
when I went to visit your familyfor Christmas break.

32:41.350 --> 32:45.485
You and I were pretty much done,and I had a little...

32:45.528 --> 32:47.313
thing with your dad.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.097
It was stupid,

32:49.141 --> 32:51.012
and it only happened
a couple of times,

32:51.056 --> 32:54.189
but he wasn't nearly as
responsible as you were.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.451
That's one way to put it.

32:55.495 --> 32:58.150
You knew Connor wasn't mine
all this time?

33:00.108 --> 33:03.416
Then why did you show up here
saying that he was?I really did need a break.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.157
Ugh.And Connor's been asking

33:05.200 --> 33:06.549
about his father nonstop.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.029
So, since his real dadpassed away,

33:08.073 --> 33:11.250
I figured Liam was
the next best thing,

33:11.293 --> 33:13.730
especially when I found out
you two were getting married.

33:13.774 --> 33:17.212
I mean... it seemed like
an ideal family for Connor.

33:18.605 --> 33:19.954
Obviously,
appearances can be deceiving.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.304
LIAM:
So, why did you lie
to me back then?

33:22.348 --> 33:24.350
You said it yourself,
we were basically done.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.004
So, why didn't you just
tell me he wasn't mine?

33:27.744 --> 33:29.311
Spit it out, Swiss Miss.

33:30.356 --> 33:33.402
I promised I'd keep the identity

33:33.446 --> 33:34.795
of Connor's real father
a secret.

33:34.838 --> 33:35.796
You promised who?

33:35.839 --> 33:37.885
I can't say.

33:38.973 --> 33:41.671
Obviously, she's talkingabout your mother.

33:46.589 --> 33:49.375
LIAM:
How could you let me think
I had a kid out there

33:49.418 --> 33:50.376
all these years?

33:50.419 --> 33:51.899
Always with the drama.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.292
Huh?Oh, come on.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.250
You worshippedyour father.

33:55.294 --> 33:58.471
I could not risk ruiningthat relationship,

33:58.514 --> 34:00.212
especiallyafter he passed.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.691
What good would that do?

34:01.735 --> 34:03.084
You should be thanking me.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.521
Oh, please. You have never
done a selfless thing

34:05.565 --> 34:06.696
in your whole life.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.263
I think you couldn't

34:08.307 --> 34:10.396
stand the idea
of people finding out

34:10.439 --> 34:12.093
that your husband had a son

34:12.137 --> 34:13.921
with a barely legal
high school kid.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.489
That is not true.I did it for Liam.

34:17.533 --> 34:18.534
Liam,

34:18.578 --> 34:20.145
please.

34:21.885 --> 34:25.672
I may not love all your choices,but I love you.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.763
Liam, listen to one
of your choices.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.330
Someone who loves you

34:31.373 --> 34:34.072
would never do what
she did to you.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.902
You can't trust this woman.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.734
Fallon's right.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.519
Liam.Stop.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.869
I don't want to hear
another word from you.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.307
You know what? And don't bothershowing up at the wedding.

34:52.351 --> 34:53.961
Oh.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.231
Maintenance found itin the elevator.

35:03.275 --> 35:04.493
The commissionermust have

35:04.537 --> 35:06.147
dropped it when he wasbringing in his luggage.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.801
Do I want to know
the real story?

35:07.844 --> 35:10.804
Well, I'm hoping that if I comp

35:10.847 --> 35:12.414
the entire bar tabfor the evening,

35:12.458 --> 35:14.155
you will convincethe commissioner that is

35:14.199 --> 35:16.679
the real story.The whole tab?

35:16.723 --> 35:18.681
I'll find a way.

35:18.725 --> 35:21.510
♪ I get this feeling, it's likeparadise, paradise... ♪

35:21.554 --> 35:23.643
And for what it's worth?

35:23.686 --> 35:25.384
Kirby did a great
job with this party.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.389
I'm really sorry, Sam.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.042
I just wanted everything
to be perfect

35:32.086 --> 35:34.784
so that you could see how good
I would be if I had this job.

35:34.828 --> 35:38.092
But I... I should never haveaccused your friend of stealing.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.746
I just got carried away.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.400
Kirby.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.882
You were just being
a vigilant employee.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.058
I'm the one who's sorry.

35:48.102 --> 35:49.364
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

35:50.496 --> 35:53.194
The job is yours
if you still want it.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.674
Of course I want it.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.458
Well, then,
you're officially hired.

35:56.502 --> 35:57.851
Thank you.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.332
What's wrong?

36:00.375 --> 36:03.117
I can't find my keys.RAMY:
Sam.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.728
You, uh, dropped
these in my room.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.556
They must have fallen out

36:07.600 --> 36:08.601
while you were fixing
the curtain rod.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.125
You know how to fix
a curtain rod?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.910
Long story. Thanks.

36:13.954 --> 36:16.696
Of course. Uh,
see you tomorrow.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.876
Mrs. Colby.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.836
Oh, my God. Did Jeff...

36:26.880 --> 36:28.838
No, no, no, no, no.
He's-he's okay for now.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.972
Um, I've...

36:32.015 --> 36:35.105
I've decided that I'm
going to do the surgery.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.718
Donate, not perform it.

36:38.761 --> 36:41.024
But you saidyou might not survive.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.983
I might not.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.506
But I took a vow

36:44.550 --> 36:45.942
to do no harm,

36:45.986 --> 36:47.422
and I can't let Jeff die

36:47.466 --> 36:48.902
if there's something I
can do to prevent it.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.208
You can't do yourself harm,

36:50.251 --> 36:52.035
either.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.385
Come here.

36:57.084 --> 37:01.610
Last night, I realized how many
people Jeff's leaving behind.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.960
And if I die in surgery,

37:04.004 --> 37:05.701
at this point,

37:05.745 --> 37:08.835
nobody besides you
is gonna even notice.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.231
I don't want you to die.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.886
I don't want to, either.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.327
Oh.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.763
Mrs. Carrington.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.634
Uh, what are you...

37:29.812 --> 37:31.597
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.686
It's been three weeks
since my last confession.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.297
You know what?

37:36.341 --> 37:38.517
It's good enough.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.481
So, tell me
what's troubling you.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.483
Someone recently
accused me

37:48.527 --> 37:51.573
of being political
and manipulative.

37:51.617 --> 37:52.966
And they were right.

37:53.009 --> 37:56.361
This clinic was supposed to be
my absolution,

37:56.404 --> 37:59.146
but even it's become corrupt.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.322
Feels like every day,

38:01.366 --> 38:03.019
I'm getting further
from God's graces,

38:03.063 --> 38:05.979
and I'm afraid
that someday soon,

38:06.022 --> 38:08.242
I won't be able
to find my way back.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.854
Well, God doesn't forsake
his children.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.858
I know I can't undo
the harm I've caused,

38:15.902 --> 38:18.992
but I can vow to put good
into the world

38:19.035 --> 38:20.689
from here on out.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.736
If you'll help me.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.177
I'll talk to the board.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.092
But it's only becauseI'd hate to see tears

38:32.135 --> 38:35.095
and, well, I really do loveveterans as much as you.

38:36.139 --> 38:37.010
I can't thank you enough.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.446
And...

38:38.490 --> 38:40.056
I really am sorry

38:40.100 --> 38:42.058
about getting off to such
a rocky start, Father.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.451
Oh...And...

38:43.495 --> 38:45.584
I can't believe

38:45.627 --> 38:47.194
I accused you
of flirting with me.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.109
Oh.

38:49.152 --> 38:51.111
I mean, I definitely wasflirting with you.

38:51.154 --> 38:53.026
And I...

38:53.069 --> 38:55.333
really look forwardto working together.

38:56.464 --> 38:59.032
Five Hail Marys
and one Our Father.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.427
I'm sorry again
about the whole...

39:02.470 --> 39:04.690
auto theft thing.It's okay.

39:04.733 --> 39:07.736
I know in your own
incredibly twisted way,

39:07.780 --> 39:09.390
you were just trying
to protect Connor.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.827
I'm glad he has someonelike you in his corner.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.526
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.266
Me, too.

39:17.093 --> 39:19.052
Are you gonna come visit me?

39:23.099 --> 39:24.362
All the time.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.365
And hey, no matter what,

39:27.408 --> 39:29.149
we're family, okay?

39:29.192 --> 39:31.281
Okay.

39:42.641 --> 39:45.034
Ah, Fallon.I just wanted
to thank you.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.862
It meant a lot to me
that you were willing

39:46.906 --> 39:49.125
to violate
your new do-gooder vow

39:49.169 --> 39:50.257
to help me destroy

39:50.300 --> 39:51.476
an innocent woman's credibility

39:51.519 --> 39:52.651
and steal her kid.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.043
It's the type of thing

39:54.087 --> 39:55.523
father-daughter memories
are made of.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.264
Well, it was nice
to spend time together,

39:57.307 --> 39:59.353
that's for sure.
I've missed you.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.878
Good. Because Liam and Iare moving back into the manor.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.794
This is my home.

40:05.838 --> 40:08.449
And also, La Miragehas a terrible breakfast buffet.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.537
And,

40:09.581 --> 40:10.669
compared to Laura,

40:10.712 --> 40:11.844
you're parent of the year.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.280
I'll take it.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.412
Welcome back.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.804
Thanks.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.415
Oh.

40:17.458 --> 40:20.461
So, what were the skeletons
in Alexis's closet?

40:20.505 --> 40:23.899
I mean, what was so bad that
she was willing to leave me?

40:23.943 --> 40:26.467
Oh, I can't tell you that.

40:26.511 --> 40:27.642
Not to protect Alexis.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.165
To-to protect you.

40:40.699 --> 40:42.701
See you both soon.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.137
Okay?

40:57.193 --> 40:59.369
Sir, you have a visitor.

41:02.372 --> 41:04.157
Laura?Blake.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.594
We need to talk.

41:06.638 --> 41:07.900
ANDERS:
Can I get you something?

41:07.943 --> 41:10.206
Coffee? Tea? Horse tranquilizer?

41:10.250 --> 41:12.426
Some privacy would be nice.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.123
I don't think
that's a good idea.

41:14.167 --> 41:16.343
I don't recall
asking your opinion.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.260
Thank you, Anders.
That'll be all.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.741
I'll be rightoutside the door.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.220
Well, this is a surprise,

41:24.264 --> 41:25.787
Laura, though I
suppose it's good

41:25.831 --> 41:28.181
for the in-laws
to formally sit down together.

41:28.224 --> 41:29.530
Save it.

41:29.574 --> 41:32.838
If I have my way,
we'll never be in-laws.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.143
I'm sorry?

41:34.187 --> 41:36.494
I'm the final approval VKI needs

41:36.537 --> 41:38.626
to sell Carrington Atlantic
to Jeff Colby.

41:39.671 --> 41:41.542
Okay.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.065
I want my son back.

41:43.109 --> 41:45.546
So, in exchangefor your terminating

41:45.590 --> 41:48.375
your daughter's relationship
with Liam,

41:48.418 --> 41:50.595
I'll block the sale of C.A.

41:50.638 --> 41:51.552
and make sure

41:51.596 --> 41:54.076
the company is sold to you.
