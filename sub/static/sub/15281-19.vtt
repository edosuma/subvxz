WEBVTT

00:48.110 --> 00:50.647
MOM, DAD! DAD,
WE HAVE TO GO!

00:50.680 --> 00:51.169
WHAT?

00:51.210 --> 00:52.245
THE HOUSE IS
ON FIRE,

00:52.280 --> 00:53.645
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE!

00:53.680 --> 00:55.113
COME ON,
WE HAVE TO GO!

00:55.150 --> 00:56.185
THE PHONE'S
DEAD--GO!

00:56.220 --> 00:57.710
COME ON,
WE GOTTA GO!

00:57.750 --> 00:59.308
COME ON.
STAY DOWN.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.249
STAY DOWN.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.871
SOMEBODY!

02:27.540 --> 02:29.405
SOMEBODY!

02:30.410 --> 02:34.346
SOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP US!

04:23.530 --> 04:25.828
"THE TORTURE OF
A BAD CONSCIENCE

04:25.860 --> 04:27.953
IS THE HELL OF
A LIVING SOUL."

04:28.000 --> 04:29.592
JOHN CALVIN.

04:29.630 --> 04:32.428
TWO FIRES,
TWO FAMILIES IN THREE WEEKS.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.563
THE FIRST FAMILY,
THE JARVIS',

04:34.600 --> 04:35.692
ALL DIED.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.628
LAST NIGHT,
THE CUTLERS.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.729
ONLY ONE SURVIVOR,
CHARLOTTE CUTLER,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.668
SHE'S IN CRITICAL
CONDITION WITH

04:41.710 --> 04:43.598
BURNS TO OVER
60% OF HER BODY.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.572
WELL,
IT'S NO ACCIDENT.

04:45.610 --> 04:46.747
IT'S THE SAME M.O.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.509
NO FUSES, KEROSEN E,

04:48.550 --> 04:49.448
MULTIPLE POINTS
OF ORIGIN,

04:49.490 --> 04:52.584
FAMILIES
TARGETED AT HOME
WHILE THEY SLEPT.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.451
THE BAY AREA HAS
A SERIAL ARSONIST.

04:54.490 --> 04:57.527
STATISTICALLY, 94% OF
ALL SERIAL ARSONISTS

04:57.560 --> 04:59.619
ARE MALE, 75% ARE WHITE,

04:59.660 --> 05:01.628
AND FEW, IF ANY,
ARE EVER CAUGHT.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.696
FEW

05:03.730 --> 05:06.563
ABOUT 16%, AND THOSE
16% SET 30-PLUS

05:06.600 --> 05:08.363
FIRES BEFORE THEY WERE
EVER APPREHENDED.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.106
I'M TRYING TO BE MORE
CONVERSATIONAL.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.574
OH. IT'S NOT
WORKING.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.498
MOST SERIAL
ARSONISTS

05:14.540 --> 05:15.871
DON'T INTEND TO
INFLICT HARM.

05:15.910 --> 05:18.401
INJURIES OR DEATH,
THOSE ARE ACCIDENTAL.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.644
IT'S NOT ABOUT
VIOLENCE.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.977
FOR THIS ONE IT IS.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.647
IT'S ALSO ABOUT POWER.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.648
SEEING THE DESTRUCT IVE
FORCE OF THEIR FIRES.

05:25.690 --> 05:26.782
WATCHING THE CHAOS,

05:26.820 --> 05:30.620
FOR THEM, FIRE'S
JUST A SUBSTITUTE
FOR SEXUAL RELEASE.

05:30.660 --> 05:31.388
OH, GREAT,
SO IF THESE GUYS

05:31.430 --> 05:33.796
DON'T GET LAID,
THEY START FIRES?

05:33.830 --> 05:34.728
OR IN THIS CASE,

05:34.760 --> 05:37.866
BURN ENTIRE FAMILIES
TO DEATH.

05:37.900 --> 05:38.821
NO STATISTIC?

05:38.870 --> 05:42.738
NOPE. THEY DON'T HAVE
STATISTICS ON THIS GUY.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.465
ONE OF A KIND.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.260
THANK GOD.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.437
THREE WEEKS AGO,
THIS SERIAL ARSONIST

05:47.480 --> 05:49.607
ESCALATED INTO
A SERIAL KILLER

05:49.650 --> 05:51.402
WHOSE WEAPON IS FIRE.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.144
WHY?

05:52.180 --> 05:54.614
MAJOR EVENT.
POSSIBLY THE BREAKUP

05:54.650 --> 05:56.982
OF HIS PRIMARY
SEXUAL OUTLET.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.113
THE SEPARATION,
THE LOSS.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.651
WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS?

06:00.690 --> 06:03.158
SFPD CAN'T CONNECT
THE JARVIS' AND THE CUTLERS,

06:03.190 --> 06:05.658
BUT WITNESSES PUT
AN UNIDENTIFIED

06:05.690 --> 06:07.999
LATE MODEL GOLD SEDAN
NEAR BOTH FIRES.

06:08.030 --> 06:09.759
RUN THE CAR. GARCIA,
RUN THE VICTIMS

06:09.800 --> 06:10.926
THROUGH THE SYSTEM,
IF THERE'S ANY

06:10.970 --> 06:12.528
CONNECTION
WE NEED TO FIND IT.

06:12.570 --> 06:13.389
YES, SIR.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.395
WE NEED VICTIMOLOGY.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.089
I'LL GO SEE
CHARLOTTE CUTLER.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.404
YOU TOOK THE BURN ONE
LAST TIME.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.079
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

06:38.490 --> 06:41.493
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THE FIRES?

06:41.530 --> 06:44.499
I'M GIVING HER AS MUCH
PAINKILLER AS I CAN.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.792
SHE ASKED ABOUT
HER HUSBAND AND SON.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.628
SHE PASSED OUT AGAIN
BEFORE I HAD TO ANSWER.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.559
SO SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.068
WHATEVER YOU TELL HER,

06:53.110 --> 06:57.171
SHE WON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW DIFFERENT.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.478
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.889
DID SHE JUST TELL US TO LIE
TO A MATERIAL WITNESS?

07:04.920 --> 07:09.653
NO. SHE TOLD US
THAT WE COULD.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.994
WELCOME.
RICARDO VEGA, SFFDR.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.702
HI. JASON GIDEON,
THIS IS DEREK MORGAN.

07:23.740 --> 07:24.638
MOST LIKELY
THE ARSON SUSPECT

07:24.670 --> 07:26.604
IS A FIRST RESPONDER WHO
SET BOTH FIRES WITH

07:26.640 --> 07:28.130
PREMEDITATIVE INTENT
TO RETURN TO IT

07:28.180 --> 07:29.602
WITHIN A PROFESSIONAL
CAPACITY.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.674
YOU READ MY PAPER.

07:30.710 --> 07:31.779
"PROFILES OF
A SERIAL ARSONIST,"

07:31.810 --> 07:33.118
I MAKE EVERYONE ON
MY TEAM READ IT.

07:33.150 --> 07:34.572
I'VE RUN THE FIRST
RESPONDERS OF

07:34.620 --> 07:36.110
BOTH FIRES, THESE ARE
THE PEDIGREES OF

07:36.150 --> 07:37.981
EVERYONE THAT WAS HERE
THAT NIGHT.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.716
NO FIRE, POLICE, OR EMT
RESPONDED TO BOTH.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.785
NO ONE EXCEPT ME, WHICH
IS WHY I'VE INCLUDED

07:42.830 --> 07:45.128
COPIES OF MY DEPARTMENT
PERFORMANCE REVIEWS,

07:45.160 --> 07:46.889
MEDICAL RECORDS,
AND PSYCH-EVALS.

07:46.930 --> 07:47.954
IT'S UNNECESSARY.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.796
NO, IT'S NOT.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.798
YOUR BEST SUSPECT IS
A FIREMAN WHO SAW

07:50.830 --> 07:53.162
BOTH FIRES BURNING.
THAT'S ME.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.792
I'M SAVING YOU TIME.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.708
COME ON, I'LL WALK
YOU THROUGH IT.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.601
PAGING DR. BENDER.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.708
MRS. CUTLER?

08:03.750 --> 08:06.173
I'M SPECIAL AGENT
AARON HOTCHNER,

08:06.210 --> 08:09.179
THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT
EMILY PRENTISS.

08:09.220 --> 08:12.189
HELLO. WHERE'S PAUL?

08:12.220 --> 08:13.653
YOUR SON--

08:13.690 --> 08:15.612
WAS WITH YOU THE NIGHT
OF THE FIRE.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.820
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.680
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.152
WE'RE FBI AGENTS.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.624
WE THINK THAT THE FIRE MAY
HAVE BEEN SET INTENTIONALLY.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.820
I'M VERY TIRED.

08:25.870 --> 08:26.939
I UNDERSTAND.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.699
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

08:28.740 --> 08:33.029
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD JUST
GIVE US A COUPLE OF MINUTES?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.737
I WANT YOU TO THINK
BACK TO THAT NIGHT.

08:35.780 --> 08:39.841
WAS THERE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

08:40.250 --> 08:44.311
THINK ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT YOU NORMALLY DO.

08:44.350 --> 08:47.717
UH, GET UNDRESSED,
WASH YOUR FACE...

08:47.760 --> 08:50.729
I COULDN'T BRUSH
MY TEETH.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.852
DENNIS?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.790
THE WATER'S
NOT WORKING.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.957
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.699
DENNIS GOT
THE WATER BACK ON.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.833
THEN...

09:02.870 --> 09:06.806
THEN...YOU WENT TO BED?

09:08.010 --> 09:10.740
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT WOKE YOU UP?

09:10.780 --> 09:11.872
PAUL.

09:11.910 --> 09:15.243
NOT THE SMOKE ALARMS?

09:16.180 --> 09:18.648
IT WAS PAUL.

09:18.890 --> 09:22.257
WHAT ELSE DO YOU REMEMBER?

09:23.930 --> 09:27.752
DENNIS UNLOCKED IT
AND IT WOULDN'T OPEN.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.859
HE UNLOCKED WHAT?

09:29.900 --> 09:30.594
THE FRONT DOOR!

09:30.630 --> 09:34.760
SOMEBODY PLEASE
HELP US, PLEASE!

09:38.840 --> 09:40.273
WHAT'S WRONG?!

09:40.310 --> 09:41.777
I CA--

09:46.920 --> 09:48.774
SOMEBODY!

09:50.420 --> 09:51.785
SOMEBODY, PLEASE...

09:51.820 --> 09:54.653
HELP US, PLEASE...

09:58.090 --> 10:01.298
AND THEN I SAW
THE FIREMAN.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.003
DENNIS? PAUL...

10:11.040 --> 10:12.905
WHERE'S MY BABY?
PAUL.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.771
WHERE ARE THEY

10:14.810 --> 10:15.629
THEY'RE FINE.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.719
THEY'RE JUST OUTSIDE
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.944
OHH...

10:20.980 --> 10:22.982
OH, RIGHT.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.648
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.861
NO, I'M NOT READY.
COULD YOU--

10:37.900 --> 10:40.960
PLEASE TELL THEM TO WAIT
A MINUTE, PLEASE?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.035
I'M NOT READY.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.231
AGENT PRENTISS
WILL TELL THEM.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.239
YOU CALL GIDEON
AND MORGAN?

10:52.880 --> 10:55.769
I CAN STAY WITH YOU
UNTIL YOU'RE READY.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.845
IF YOU'D LIKE.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.886
I'D LIKE THAT.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.048
SHE TOLD HER HUSBAND
THERE WAS NO WATER.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.877
WHERE'S THE SHUT-OFF?

11:26.920 --> 11:30.048
RUNS UP
THE SIDEWALK.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.218
OK, SO I'M THE UNSUB.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.392
ALL RIGHT. I NEED
TO GET IN THE HOUSE.

11:44.030 --> 11:47.033
SO I TURN THE WATER
OFF RIGHT HERE.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.029
AND THEN I WAIT.

11:58.850 --> 12:01.774
I WAIT FOR HIM
TO COME OUTSIDE.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.418
I WAIT FOR THEM
TO GO TO SLEEP...

12:16.100 --> 12:20.264
AND THEN I CAREFULLY
POUR THE FUEL.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.802
CUTTING ACCESS TO
THE BACK DOOR.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.272
I LEAVE THEM ONLY
ONE WAY TO GET OUT.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.988
THE FRONT DOOR.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.228
SHE SAID DENNIS
UNLOCKED IT.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.955
STILL WOULDN'T
OPEN.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.025
WHEN WE GOT HERE
IT WAS UNLOCKED.

12:49.060 --> 12:49.799
DOOR OPENS IN.

12:49.830 --> 12:50.922
NOTHING HELD IT
FROM THE OUTSIDE,

12:50.970 --> 12:54.189
SO WHATEVER HE USED
TO KEEP IT SHUT WAS
ON THE INSIDE.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.231
HERE--SEE THESE
LIGHT SPOTS?

12:56.270 --> 12:58.306
SOMETHING WAS
JAMMED IN THERE,

12:58.340 --> 13:01.104
SHADED THE SURFACE
BENEATH IT FROM THE SMOKE.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.279
WEDGED IN TIGHT, SOME KIND
OF EXPANDING TOOL.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.005
SO WHERE IS IT?
IF HE JAMMED IT

13:05.050 --> 13:06.244
FROM THE INSIDE
IT'D STILL BE THERE.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.941
WE DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING.

13:07.980 --> 13:08.810
TOOK IT WITH HIM.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.283
THAT MEANS HE WOULD'VE
STILL BEEN INSIDE

13:10.320 --> 13:11.287
AS IT WAS BURNING.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.379
HE WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE
BEEN IN FULL FIRE GEAR.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.308
SHE DIDN'T SEE A FIREMAN.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.952
SHE SAW THE UNSUB.

13:16.990 --> 13:18.981
HOLD ON,
THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE,

13:19.030 --> 13:21.055
WHY WOULD HE STAY
INSIDE OF IT?

13:21.100 --> 13:24.592
WANTED TO WATCH THEM BURN.

13:24.630 --> 13:27.838
SOMEBODY,
PLEASE, HELP US!

13:37.480 --> 13:38.276
THIS PLACE IS GREAT!

13:38.310 --> 13:40.119
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
ESPRESSO MACHINE.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.448
DR. REID, THIS IS
DETECTIVE CASTRO,

13:42.480 --> 13:44.380
SHE IS WITH THE SFPD LIAISON.

13:44.420 --> 13:47.059
BURNED MY HAND ON THAT
ESPRESSO MACHINE.

13:47.090 --> 13:47.954
OOH!

13:47.990 --> 13:49.082
A GENIUS, YOU SAID?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.520
YEAH, UH, HIS COORDINATION
DROPS OFF WHEN HE'S THINKING.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.596
GOOD. 'CAUSE WE NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHY

13:53.630 --> 13:55.894
THIS PSYCHO CHOOSES
THESE FAMILIES.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.023
HE'S MOST LIKELY
TARGETING THE MEN.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.561
THEY'RE THE ONLY SIMILAR
MEMBERS OF THE TWO FAMILIES.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.431
C. JARVIS, 29,
WORKED FULL-TIME.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.234
CHARLOTTE CUTLER, 39,
WAS A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.908
THE JARVIS'
HAD TWO GIRLS

14:06.940 --> 14:07.804
IN PUBLIC GRADE SCHOOL,

14:07.840 --> 14:10.308
CUTLER'S HAD A SON
IN PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.442
THE JARVIS'
WENT TO CHURCH,

14:11.480 --> 14:13.209
THE CUTLERS DIDN'T.
NOTHING HOLDS.

14:13.250 --> 14:13.978
EXCEPT WITH THE MEN--

14:14.020 --> 14:15.442
BOTH IN THEIR LATE
THIRTIES, WHITE,

14:15.480 --> 14:17.141
APPROXIMATELY
6-FEET TALL,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.283
BROWN HAIR, NICE HOMES,
NICE FAMILIES,

14:19.320 --> 14:21.914
GOOD JOBS, THAT'S
THE CONNECTION.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.086
WHAT CONNECTION?

14:23.130 --> 14:25.451
CUTLER WAS A LAWYER,
JARVIS AN EXECUTIVE.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.479
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THEY EVER MET.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.554
BUT THEY'RE OF
THE SAME TYPE.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.319
WE KNOW THAT MOST
SERIAL ARSONISTS
ARE WHITE MALES.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.463
A COMPLEX M.O.
DEVELOPS OVER TIME.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.592
THIS GUY IS IN HIS
MID-THIRTIES,

14:33.640 --> 14:37.508
HE SEES THE VICTIMS
AS SUCCESSFUL VERSIONS
OF HIMSELF.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.100
AND HE RESENTS
THEM FOR IT.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.539
I'LL ISSUE AN A.P.B.

14:41.580 --> 14:45.448
FOR A RESENTFUL
6-FOOT WHITE GUY.

14:50.350 --> 14:53.319
OK, GREAT.
I GOT IT. THANKS.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.009
CHARLOTTE CUTLER DIED.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.426
I'M SORRY.
NEXT TIME I'LL GO.

14:57.460 --> 14:59.052
WHAT HAVE WE GOT
ON THE VEHICLE?

14:59.090 --> 15:01.991
UH, IT IS A 1999
GOLD FORD TAURUS.

15:02.030 --> 15:04.498
85% OF THAT MODEL
COLOR-COMBO WERE

15:04.530 --> 15:06.930
SOLD DOMESTICALLY AS
FLEET VEHICLES.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.461
COMPANY CARS,
RENTAL FLEETS.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.569
DID YOU CHECK
ALL AGENCIES?

15:10.610 --> 15:11.634
YEAH, NONE OF THEM
KEPT THEM FOR

15:11.670 --> 15:13.069
THE PAST THREE
WEEKS, OR RENTED

15:13.110 --> 15:14.509
DURING BOTH FIRES,
SO...

15:14.540 --> 15:17.509
WHO KEEPS A RENTAL
CAR FOR THREE WEEKS?

15:17.550 --> 15:18.699
THEN IT'S NOT A RENTAL.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.012
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
A COMPANY CAR.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.449
THIS GUY, HE HAD
TO HAVE TIME

15:21.480 --> 15:22.947
TO STALK HIS
VICTIMS.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.548
AND IF HIS JOB
INVOLVES DRIVING--

15:24.590 --> 15:26.717
THERE WAS A SERIAL
ARSONIST UP IN SEATTLE,

15:26.750 --> 15:28.058
EARLY NINETIES...

15:28.090 --> 15:29.250
PAUL KENNETH KELLER.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.154
YEAH. HE USED TO DRIVE
AROUND ALL DAY

15:30.190 --> 15:33.398
SELLING ADVERTISING
FOR HIS DAD'S AGENCY,

15:33.430 --> 15:34.954
PICKING OUT PLACES
TO BURN.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.366
COMPANY CAR.
GOOD WORK, J.J.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.194
LET'S DO THE PROFILE.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.232
THE UNSUB WE'RE
LOOKING FOR IS A

15:43.270 --> 15:45.204
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT,
UNDER-ACHIEVING,

15:45.240 --> 15:47.379
35 TO 45-YEAR-OLD
WHITE MALE

15:47.410 --> 15:50.072
WITH A SEVERE NARCISSISTIC
CHARACTER DISORDER.

15:50.110 --> 15:52.601
NOTHING IN HIS LIFE
WORKS FOR LONG.

15:52.650 --> 15:55.141
IF HE WAS MARRIED,
HE'S NOW DIVORCED.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.512
IF EMPLOYED,
IT WON'T LAST.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.188
WHAT HE WANTS
IS ADMIRATION,

15:59.220 --> 16:01.256
BUT HE'S GOT NO
RESPECT FOR OTHERS--

16:01.290 --> 16:02.052
NOT THEIR FEELINGS,

16:02.090 --> 16:03.626
AND MOST CERTAINLY
NOT THEIR SAFETY.

16:03.660 --> 16:04.354
HE FEELS ENTITLED.

16:04.390 --> 16:06.483
HE'S LIKE A PETULANT
ADOLESCENT.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.192
HE BOTH RESENTS AND HE
ABSOLUTELY EXPECT S

16:09.230 --> 16:10.527
EVERYONE TO
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

16:10.570 --> 16:11.559
AND GIVEN THAT
A MALE RELATIVE

16:11.600 --> 16:12.760
WOULDN'T TOLERATE
THIS BEHAVIOR,

16:12.800 --> 16:14.529
HE MOST LIKELY LIVES
WITH A FEMALE RELATIVE--

16:14.570 --> 16:18.108
HIS MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER,
AUNT, WHOM HE EXPLOITS.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.176
HIS ARSON KIT
IS EXPENSIVE.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.700
FIRE SUIT,
OXYGEN MASK.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.571
THIS SUGGESTS THAT
HE MAY BE EMPLOYED,

16:23.610 --> 16:25.999
BUT HIS PERSONALITY WILL
NOT ALLOW HIM TO WORK

16:26.050 --> 16:28.075
CLOSELY WITH OTHERS
IN AN OFFICE SETTING.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.610
THIS ALONG WITH
THE INFORMATION ABOUT

16:29.650 --> 16:31.311
HIS VEHICLE LEAD US
TO BELIEVE THAT

16:31.350 --> 16:33.250
HE'S A TRAVELING
SALESMAN OF SOME SORT,

16:33.290 --> 16:36.009
WHO WORKS FOR A COMPANY
BIG ENOUGH NOT TO NOTICE

16:36.060 --> 16:37.186
THAT HE'S A SOCIOPATH.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.688
OK, THIS SCUMBAG HAS ISSUES,
WE ALL GET IT.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.152
BUT WHY FIRE?

16:42.200 --> 16:44.259
HE'S LIKE A DRUG ADDICT.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.029
ONLY FIRE'S HIS DRUG.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.094
EACH TIME AN ADDICT
NEEDS A FIX,

16:47.140 --> 16:49.062
THEY NEED MORE OF
THE DRUG TO GET OFF.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.364
SO HIS CRIMES MOST
LIKELY GET MUCH WORSE.

16:51.410 --> 16:57.371
IT WOULD BE ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
QUIT WITHOUT HELP.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.612
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:01.650 --> 17:04.619
SHE SHOOTS...

17:04.650 --> 17:07.118
SHE SCORES!

17:07.160 --> 17:08.081
THE CROWD GOES WILD.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.159
I JUST PUT THE ENTIRE
DEPARTMENT ON TAC ALERT.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.658
GARCIA'S ON
LINE ONE.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.419
BRACE YOURSELVES.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.827
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
THE MEANING OF LUST.

17:19.870 --> 17:20.598
DID SHE SAY LUST?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.392
MM-HMM.
I CROSS-REFERENCED

17:22.440 --> 17:23.702
EVERY KNOWN FACT
ON THE VICTIMS,

17:23.740 --> 17:25.628
AND I JUST FOUND
A WEBSITE THAT LINKS BOTH

17:25.670 --> 17:28.230
DENNIS CUTLER AND
MATTHEW JARVIS' COMPANIES

17:28.280 --> 17:31.545
ON A LIST OF BUSINESSES
GUILTY OF L.U.S.T.

17:31.580 --> 17:32.672
I'M MISSING SOMETHING.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.746
LEAKING UNDERGROUND
STORAGE TANKS.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.475
THE WEBSITE BELONGS TO
A RECENTLY FOUNDED

17:36.520 --> 17:39.341
SAN FRANCISCO CHAPTER OF
THE EARTH DEFENSE FRONT.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.550
THE EDF?

17:40.590 --> 17:41.579
THE ECO-TERRORIST
GROUP?

17:41.620 --> 17:42.314
TH EY AREN'T
ECO-TERRORISTS,

17:42.360 --> 17:43.452
TH EY'RE ENVIRONM ENTAL
ACT IVISTS.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.754
DENNIS CUTLER
AND MATTHEW JARVIS MAY
DISAGREE WITH YOU.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.496
I'M PRETTY SURE SOME
EDF PEOPLE WERE

17:47.530 --> 17:49.395
SENT UP FOR TORCHING
AN SUV DEALERSHIP

17:49.430 --> 17:50.795
A WHILE BACK
IN SAN DIEGO.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.366
NOBODY DIED
IN THOSE FIRES.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.662
MAYBE THEY GOT
LUCKY.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.564
NO, IT'S NOT LUCK.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.488
THIS GROUP'S DEDICATED
TO PROTECTING LIFE.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.405
WHAT, DO THEY WAIT
UNTIL NO ONE'S HOME

17:58.440 --> 17:59.532
AND THEN LIGHT THE PLACE UP?

17:59.570 --> 18:00.400
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DO.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.238
SO TELL ME WHO WE'RE
PLAYING AGAIN TODAY.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.201
WE PLAY THE JETS.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.478
THE JETS, RIGHT, OK.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.445
I'LL BE--
IN A SECOND.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.344
KATIE! COME ON.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.838
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE LATE
TWICE IN ONE WEEK.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.583
YEAH? YEAH.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.712
I'M COMING!

18:16.760 --> 18:18.227
COME ON, SWEETIE.

18:18.260 --> 18:21.149
RIGHT. NO, I GOT THAT.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.125
YEAH. NO, WE'RE LEAVIN'--
WE'RE LEAVIN' RIGHT NOW.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.694
YEAH.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.437
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

18:29.470 --> 18:31.461
WE READY?

18:32.340 --> 18:33.568
BELT.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.475
OH, YEAH.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.801
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.705
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT OPENING.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.776
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT
THE FBI DOESN'T HAVE

18:41.820 --> 18:44.618
FILES ON ORGANIZATIONS
LIKE THIS?

18:44.650 --> 18:45.412
LISTS AND MEMBERS?

18:45.450 --> 18:46.644
DOMESTIC GROUPS
LIKE THE EDF AREN'T

18:46.690 --> 18:48.385
THE BUREAU'S TOP
PRIORITY RIGHT NOW.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.853
BESIDES, THEY'RE
MORE OF A MOVEMENT

18:49.890 --> 18:50.629
THAN AN ORGANIZATION.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.685
THERE'S A CENTRAL
IDEOLOGY, BUT--

18:52.730 --> 18:54.789
CHAPTERS ARE INDEPENDENT,
THEY DON'T PAY DUES

18:54.830 --> 18:56.650
AND THEY DON'T KEEP
MEMBERSHIP LISTS.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.463
WHAT IF ONE OF
THE CHAPTERS HAS

18:58.500 --> 19:01.389
BROKEN RANKS AND
HAS A NEW BELIEF?

19:02.670 --> 19:04.262
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

19:04.310 --> 19:06.437
HEY! GET OUT, GUYS,
GET OUT! GET OUT!

19:06.470 --> 19:07.698
COME ON,
KIDS, GET OUT!

19:07.740 --> 19:08.638
GET OUT NOW!

19:08.680 --> 19:11.672
OPEN THE DOOR!
GET OUT!

19:11.710 --> 19:12.677
IT'S NOT OPENING!

19:12.710 --> 19:13.517
IT WON'T OPEN, DAD!

19:13.550 --> 19:14.869
HURTING PEOPLE'S NEVER
BEEN PART OF IT.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.945
DOESN'T TRACK. DOESN'T
FIT THE PROFILE.

19:16.980 --> 19:19.210
GARCIA, CAN YOU IDENTIFY
HOW MANY MEMBERS ARE

19:19.250 --> 19:21.286
IN THIS PARTICULAR
EDF CHAPTER?

19:21.320 --> 19:22.958
UH, IT LOOKS LIKE...

19:22.990 --> 19:24.582
A HUNDRED TO 150.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.394
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

19:27.430 --> 19:29.227
I'M SCARED, DAD!
I'M SCARED!

19:29.260 --> 19:30.898
DOORS OPEN--OPEN!

19:30.930 --> 19:33.364
START THE CAR!
I'M TRYING--

19:33.400 --> 19:34.731
IT WON'T START.

19:34.770 --> 19:35.395
HURRY!

19:35.440 --> 19:37.328
I'M SCARED, DAD,
I'M SCARED!

19:37.370 --> 19:39.964
COME ON,
GET OUT! GET OUT!

19:40.010 --> 19:40.908
COME ON!

19:40.940 --> 19:43.647
KEEP TRYING!
KEEP TRYING!

19:43.680 --> 19:46.501
KEEP TRYING--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

20:08.740 --> 20:13.473
THOMAS R. DUNLEAW,
DUNBROOK DEVELOPMENT GROUP.

20:13.510 --> 20:14.408
ON THE LIST.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.876
OK, I'M SENDING YOU A FILE
ON THE EDF LEADER.

20:17.910 --> 20:22.472
EVAN ABBY, 41, 5'11",
185 POUNDS.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.384
THAN KS, GARCIA.

20:23.420 --> 20:24.216
PARDON ME FOR ASKING, SIR,

20:24.250 --> 20:25.512
BUT HOW DO WE EVEN
KNOW HE'S INVOLVED?

20:25.550 --> 20:27.689
WE DON'T. THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INTERVIEWING

20:27.720 --> 20:28.652
ABBY AT THE CRIME
SCENE.

20:28.690 --> 20:29.987
IF HE IS THE LEADER
OF THE EDF,

20:30.020 --> 20:31.658
HIS REACTION TO ALL
THIS SHOULD TELL US

20:31.690 --> 20:34.295
EXACTLY WHAT
WE NEED TO KNOW.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.821
MAKE IT LOOK REAL.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.498
WHERE DO YOU GUYS
WANT IT?

20:38.530 --> 20:39.929
THIS IS THE SPOT.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.597
WHEN HE ARRIVES,
BRING THE FAKE BODIES

20:41.640 --> 20:43.904
RIGHT PAST US--
NICE AND SLOW.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.430
I WANT HIM
TO GET A GOOD LOOK.

20:45.470 --> 20:49.907
REMIND ME TO NEVER PLAY
POKER WITH YOU GUYS.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.578
SO WHAT DO WE HAVE
ON THIS GUY?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.019
HOTCH!
WHAT?

20:55.050 --> 20:56.711
WHAT DO WE HAVE ON
THE EDF LEADER?

20:56.750 --> 21:00.459
EVAN ABBY, 41, DIVORCED,
FATHER OF LIAM, 14.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.980
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER,

21:02.020 --> 21:04.420
DOES CONSULTS ON
REAL ESTATE PROJECTS,

21:04.460 --> 21:07.327
HAS WORKED WITH EVERY
COMPANY ON THE EDF LIST.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.897
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM.

21:14.370 --> 21:16.895
MR. ABBY, THESE ARE
SPECIAL AGENTS

21:16.940 --> 21:18.601
JASON GIDEON
AND AARON HOTCHNER.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.766
THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.472
UM, AGENT PRENTISS SAID
YOU NEEDED MY HELP

21:22.510 --> 21:24.671
WITH A L.U.S.T.
RELATED FIRE?

21:24.710 --> 21:26.371
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.878
TOM, BRAD,
KATIE DUNLEAW.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.411
ALL BURNED TO DEATH.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.953
WHEW. UH...SO, UM,

21:33.990 --> 21:37.050
WHERE'S THE--UH, WHERE'S
THE LEAKING STORAGE TANK?

21:37.090 --> 21:39.479
KATIE WAS ONLY 12.

21:39.530 --> 21:43.796
YOU'VE GOT A SON ABOUT
THAT AGE, DON'T YOU?

21:44.100 --> 21:46.989
DID YOU KNOW TOM DUNLEAW?

21:47.030 --> 21:47.860
WHAT IS THIS?

21:47.900 --> 21:49.367
HE WORKED FOR DUNBROOK
DEVELOPMENT GROUP.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.368
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
THESE QUESTIONS?

21:51.410 --> 21:53.401
YOU POSTED DUNBROOK
ON YOUR WEBSITE.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.329
MY WEBSITE? LOOK, I CAME
DOWN HERE VOLUNTARILY

21:56.380 --> 21:58.007
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD YOU
NEEDED HELP WITH A

21:58.050 --> 21:59.403
L.U.S.T.-RELATED FIRE.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.917
THREE FIRES....

22:00.950 --> 22:03.839
THREE FAMILIES...

22:03.890 --> 22:04.914
TH REE FATH ERS--

22:04.950 --> 22:07.919
WHO WORKED FOR COMPANIES
POSTED ON YOUR EDF WEBSITE.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.109
ALL BURNED TO DEATH.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.889
YOU WORKED FOR
THESE COMPANIES--

22:10.930 --> 22:11.954
EVERY ONE ON YOUR LIST.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.890
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF A CRIME?

22:13.930 --> 22:14.954
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.594
MR. ABBY,
I SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE.

22:17.630 --> 22:18.995
BUT I REJECT
THESE METHODS.

22:19.030 --> 22:22.659
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
CAUSE OR METHODS
YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.804
YOU CREATED THE SITE,
YOU POSTED THE LIST,

22:24.840 --> 22:25.932
YOU'RE THE LEADER
OF THE EDF.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.733
WELL, IF YOU COULD
PROVE THAT, WE WOULDN'T

22:27.780 --> 22:29.930
BE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION, WOULD WE?

22:29.980 --> 22:32.005
MR. ABBY, PEOPLE
ARE DYING.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.608
CHILDREN,
MR. ABBY.

22:33.650 --> 22:36.915
WE KNOW EDF'S STRATEGY HAS
ALWAYS SUPPORTED VIOLENCE.

22:36.950 --> 22:40.784
I'M ASKING YOU, HAS EDF'S
STRATEGY CHANGED?

22:40.820 --> 22:43.983
NO. IT HASN'T.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.126
HE COULD BARELY
LOOK AT THIS.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.560
A SERIAL ARSONIST
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
PEEL HIS EYES AWAY.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.033
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.129
MORE THAN JUST HIS
SUPPORT FOR THE EDF.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.159
HEY, IT OCCURRED
TO ME--

22:59.210 --> 23:01.428
IF ALL I KNEW ABOUT
THE EDF WAS THAT

23:01.480 --> 23:04.176
THEY WENT AROUND
BURNING DOWN
SUV DEALERSHIPS

23:04.210 --> 23:05.905
AND HOUSING
DEVELOPMENTS...

23:05.950 --> 23:08.043
WELL, THAT'S A COMMON
MISCONCEPTION.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.616
THAT'S MY POINT.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.140
WHAT IF OUR PROFILE
IS RIGHT--

23:11.190 --> 23:14.079
AND THE UNSUB HELD
THE SAME MISCONCEPTION?

23:14.120 --> 23:16.111
HE WANTS TO FIT IN,
HE WANTS PEOPLE

23:16.160 --> 23:17.855
AROUND HIM TO
APPRECIATE WHAT HE DOES,

23:17.890 --> 23:21.018
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT
THE UNSUB JOINED THE EDF...

23:21.060 --> 23:23.494
THINKING--
IT WAS AN
ARSONIST'S CLUB?

23:23.530 --> 23:24.758
SURE. THAT'S POSSIBLE.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.769
IF WE GIVE ABBY
OUR UNSUB'S PROFILE

23:27.800 --> 23:28.960
COULD HE HELP US
IDENTIFY HIM?

23:29.000 --> 23:29.830
WE CAN'T GIVE ABBY
THE PROFILE,

23:29.870 --> 23:31.861
NOT UNTIL WE FIND OUT
WHAT HE'S HIDING.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.129
STILL, IT SEEMS ABBY'S
OUR BEST CHANCE

23:35.180 --> 23:36.078
OF FINDING THE UNSUB.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.078
YOU WANT ABBY
OR THE EX-WIFE?

23:38.110 --> 23:39.748
ABBY.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.883
AT BERKELEY 20 YEARS AGO,

23:47.920 --> 23:50.081
EVAN WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.451
IN EVERY WAY.

23:51.490 --> 23:54.095
WARM, FUNNY, HONEST.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.995
EVEN NAIVE.

23:56.030 --> 23:56.826
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:56.860 --> 24:01.160
WE HAD SCHOOL LOANS,
I GOT PREGNANT...

24:01.200 --> 24:03.668
HIS JOB...

24:03.710 --> 24:06.008
EVAN WAS AN
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT.

24:06.040 --> 24:10.033
BUILDER'S HIRED HIM TO HELP
THEM CLEAN UP THEIR SITES.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.638
MAKE SURE THEY WERE
UP TO EPA CODE.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.218
EVAN THOUGHT THEY HIRED HIM
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.046
DID HE?

24:16.080 --> 24:18.184
NO. DEVELOPERS DON'T
CARE ABOUT MERCURY

24:18.220 --> 24:19.039
IN THE GROUNDWATER.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.513
THEY JUST WANT TO PASS
INSPECTION AS FAST

24:21.560 --> 24:22.857
AND CHEAP AS POSSIBLE.

24:22.890 --> 24:26.485
HE HAD A BUDGET,
IT WAS NEVER ENOUGH,

24:26.530 --> 24:28.748
BUT THEY DIDN'T CARE
HOW HE SPENT IT,

24:28.800 --> 24:31.121
AS LONG AS THEY PASSED
INSPECTION.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.491
WELL, HOW DID EVAN
DEAL WITH THAT?

24:33.540 --> 24:35.690
HE DRANK.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.196
IT GOT BAD.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.502
HOW BAD?

24:38.540 --> 24:40.201
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT
HURT HIMSELF.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.539
I DIDN'T KNOW IF HE
COULD LIVE WITH IT.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.105
HOW'S HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR SON LIAM?

24:46.150 --> 24:47.913
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

24:47.950 --> 24:50.145
I HAD TO THREATEN TO
TAKE HIM TO COURT

24:50.180 --> 24:53.240
TO GET HIM TO PAY
CHILD SUPPORT.

24:53.290 --> 24:55.918
MUST'VE EITHER
SCARED THE HELL

24:55.960 --> 24:58.281
OUT OF HIM OR REALLY
PISSED HIM OFF.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.025
WHY'S THAT?

25:00.060 --> 25:02.096
BECAUSE EVERY
SUNDAY NIGHT

25:02.130 --> 25:03.620
FOR THE PAST 9 MONTHS

25:03.670 --> 25:07.868
HE TOSSES $2,000 CASH
THROUGH THE MAIL SLOT.

25:07.900 --> 25:12.132
HE LEI-T LONG BEFORE
I THREW HIM OUT.

25:13.710 --> 25:17.077
I DON'T KNOW.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.270
I DON'T KNOW.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.847
BUT I PROMISE I'M GOING
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.940
OK. I LOVE YOU, TOO.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.879
EVERYTHING OK?

25:26.920 --> 25:27.818
YEAH.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.316
YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY
CLAIMING TO BE INNOCENT,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.089
HE'S ACTING PRETTY
GUILTY.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.779
I NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE EFFECT BEING

25:32.830 --> 25:34.923
CONFRONTED BY THE FBI
WILL HAVE ON A SUSPECT.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.168
I DON'T THINK HE'S EFFECTED,
I THINK HE'S FREAKED OUT.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.167
IN THE TIME WE'VE
BEEN WATCHING HIM,

25:39.200 --> 25:41.964
HE'S PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
INTO CARDBOARD BOXES,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.605
HIT HIS ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE AND 4 BANKS.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.234
IT DOES LOOK LIKE
HE'S GETTING READY TO RUN.

25:47.270 --> 25:50.535
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT DO WE DO?

25:51.910 --> 25:53.571
FOR NOW, NOTHING.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.212
WE JUST WATCH.

26:02.690 --> 26:05.124
ALL THOSE PEOPLE

26:05.160 --> 26:07.697
THAT'S EITHER A VERY
LAME GOING AWAY PARTY

26:07.730 --> 26:09.027
OR AN EDF MEETING.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.267
WE NEED TO SET SURVEILLANCE
UP. GRAB YOUR CAMERA.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.120
WHERE SHOULD I SET UP?

26:13.170 --> 26:13.989
RIGHT HERE.

26:14.040 --> 26:14.995
IF HE'S HIDING SOMETHING,

26:15.040 --> 26:17.702
WE DON'T HAVE A WARRANT,
WE DON'T HAVE SUPPLIES,

26:17.740 --> 26:18.729
YOU WANT TO INTIMIDATE HIM.

26:18.770 --> 26:22.729
I WANT ANOTHER CHANCE TO
FIND OUT WHAT HE'S HIDING.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.907
OK...

26:26.250 --> 26:28.616
SMILE, EVERYBODY.

26:56.280 --> 27:00.273
OHH...WOW, IT LOOKS
LIKE INTIMIDATION WORKED.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.856
SO WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

27:09.890 --> 27:12.279
SHOVING A BUNCH OF DEAD KIDS
IN MY FACE WASN'T ENOUGH?

27:12.330 --> 27:15.254
THOUGHT I NEEDED A LITTLE
HARASSMENT, TOO?

27:15.300 --> 27:16.255
IT'S OVER, ALL RIGHT?

27:16.300 --> 27:18.325
I DENOUNCED THE FIRES
AND THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE

27:18.370 --> 27:20.224
FOR THEM, AND I JUST
DISBANDED THE EDF.

27:20.270 --> 27:22.693
IF THE EDF HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE FIRES,

27:22.740 --> 27:24.105
WHY WOULD YOU DISBAND?

27:24.140 --> 27:26.267
DO YOU HAVE KIDS,
AGENT HOTCHNER?

27:26.310 --> 27:27.334
I HAVE A SON LIKE YOU.

27:27.370 --> 27:28.735
GOOD. THEN I'M GONNA
TELL YOU THIS,

27:28.780 --> 27:30.179
ONE FATHER TO ANOTHER.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.747
I STARTED THE EDF
FOR MY SON. AND YOURS.

27:32.780 --> 27:37.149
NOT TO HAVE SOME OTHER
GUY'S SON BURN TO DEATH.

27:37.180 --> 27:40.240
HOPE YOUR PICTURES
COME OUT.

27:42.090 --> 27:45.355
PRENTISS, DOES HE LOOK
LIKE HE WEIGHS 185 TO YOU?

27:45.390 --> 27:46.425
165, MAYBE.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.451
WHY WOULD HE HOLD
A MEETING

27:48.500 --> 27:49.990
WHEN HE KNEW
WE WERE WATCHING?

27:50.030 --> 27:52.225
HE WANTED
US TO SEE IT.

27:52.270 --> 27:54.238
HE WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE SAW HIM

27:54.270 --> 27:56.238
TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.807
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM?

28:02.840 --> 28:04.148
I DON'T KNOW.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.909
HE SEEMED PRETTY ANGRY

28:05.950 --> 28:08.077
FOR A GUY WHO'S TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.987
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO GET THOSE PHOTOS
TO GARCIA.

28:11.020 --> 28:11.816
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:11.850 --> 28:13.852
EITHER HE'S ANGRY
BECAUSE HE'S GUILTY

28:13.890 --> 28:15.312
OF A WRONGDOING,

28:15.360 --> 28:17.419
OR HE'S ANGRY BECAUSE
HIS ATTEMPTS TO DO

28:17.460 --> 28:18.484
THE RIGHT THING
WITH THE EDF

28:18.530 --> 28:20.725
HAVE GOTTEN PEOPLE
KILLED, BUT--

28:20.760 --> 28:21.727
EITHER WAY...

28:21.760 --> 28:24.126
THE ARSONIST
WAS HERE TONIGHT.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.837
YEAH, I'LL SHOW YOU
A SICK, DERANGED COWARD,

28:28.870 --> 28:32.033
YOU IGNORANT SON OF A BITCH.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.514
OHH, YEAH.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.256
DERANGED COWARD.

28:51.290 --> 28:53.827
OHH! OH, YEAH.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.159
YEAH.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.988
I'LL SHOW YOU
A DERANGED COWARD.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.109
OH, YEAH.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.132
AAH! AAH!

29:42.180 --> 29:43.329
OW!

29:43.380 --> 29:44.369
OW!

29:44.410 --> 29:46.105
OW, OW!

30:04.500 --> 30:07.389
THE VICTIM WAS
A CPA. GREG BALLOU, 39,

30:07.430 --> 30:09.364
WHITE, 6-FEET, HANDSOME.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.504
HE WAS TALKING TO HIS
FIANCE ON HIS CELL

30:11.540 --> 30:12.302
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

30:12.340 --> 30:14.228
THIS KEROSENE IS
THE SAME EXACT TYPE

30:14.280 --> 30:15.076
USED IN THE OTHER FIRES.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.839
WELL, HOTCH HAD ABBY
UNDER SURVEILLANCE

30:16.880 --> 30:17.574
AT THE TIME OF
THE ATTACK,

30:17.610 --> 30:18.349
SO WE KNOW ABBY'S
NOT THE UNSUB.

30:18.380 --> 30:20.177
WITNESSES PUT
THE GOLD SEDAN HERE,

30:20.210 --> 30:21.177
SO WE KNOW THIS IS OUR GUY.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.073
AND GIVEN THAT
THE ATTACK OCCURRED

30:22.120 --> 30:23.576
LESS THAN 30 MINUTES
AFTER THE EDF MEETING

30:23.620 --> 30:25.611
AND ABBY'S HOUSE IS LESS
THAN A MILE FROM HERE.

30:25.650 --> 30:28.084
CHANCES ARE THE UNSUB
WAS AT ABBY'S HOUSE.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.088
HE PARKED SOME DISTANCE
AWAY AND WALKED.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.953
THIS VICTIM WASN'T
EVEN CONNECTED TO
THE EDF LIST.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.457
HE WAS JUST A GUY WHO
LOOKED LIKE HE HAD

30:34.500 --> 30:36.127
A NICE LIFE LIKE
THE OTHERS.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.025
THE UNSUB DIDN'T GO
INTO A HOUSE,

30:38.070 --> 30:39.526
HE BARELY EVEN
GOT OUT OF HIS CAR.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.538
THERE WAS NO PLANNING
WHATSOEVER. WHY?

30:41.570 --> 30:44.403
HE'S EVOLVING.
HE'S DOING IT FAST.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.509
HE'S SMARTER THAN THAT.

30:45.540 --> 30:48.077
THIS WAS RANDOM,
IMPULSIVE, ADOLESCENT.

30:48.110 --> 30:50.476
LIKE A TANTRUM. HE'S GOT
DISPLACED AGGRESSION.

30:50.510 --> 30:52.341
HE LISTENS TO ABBY DENOUNCE
HIM AND HIS WORK,

30:52.380 --> 30:55.941
IT ENRAGES HIM,
AND SO THAT'S THE TRIGGER.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.538
UNSUB LASHES OUT
IMMEDIATELY.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.514
WELL, IF HE WAS AT ABBY'S
WE HAVE HIM ON CAMERA.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.359
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE GARCIA

31:01.390 --> 31:02.459
HAS A SUSPECT LIST.

31:02.490 --> 31:03.514
HE'S EVOLVING
TOO RAPIDLY.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.425
HE'S GONNA ATTACK
AGAIN SOON.

31:05.460 --> 31:08.623
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST THIS ABBY GUY
WITH THE PROFILE.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.888
LET'S GO.

31:17.070 --> 31:19.402
HE'S LEAVING, BUT NOT
THE WAY WE THOUGHT.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.429
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:20.470 --> 31:22.006
HE'S SEEING HIS
ONCOLOGIST.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.600
OHH, GOD. UCH.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.641
IT MAKES SENSE.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.216
THE BANKS, THE ATTORNEY.

31:28.250 --> 31:31.117
HE'S PUTTING HIS
AFFAIRS IN ORDER.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.913
YEAH.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.563
WHICH ONE
IS YOUR SON?

31:51.970 --> 31:52.709
CATCH ER.

31:52.740 --> 31:54.674
DOES HE KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

31:54.710 --> 31:58.441
I THINK SO, BUT WE HAVE
AN ARRANGEMENT.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.607
WHAT'S THAT?

32:00.650 --> 32:02.948
WE BOTH PRETEND I'M NOT.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.584
GO FOR IT, KID!

32:04.620 --> 32:07.214
I'M SORRY.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.950
HOW LONG
DO YOU HAVE?

32:18.430 --> 32:20.660
6 MONTHS
WOULD BE A MIRACLE.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.362
AND YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYONE?

32:23.400 --> 32:25.504
NO.

32:26.470 --> 32:29.598
IT'S LEUKEMIA.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.744
LUST CAN BE LETHAL.

32:31.780 --> 32:36.979
I STARTED THE EDF RIGHT
AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.045
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

32:39.090 --> 32:42.548
MY FATHER, WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL...

32:42.590 --> 32:44.455
EVERYONE KNEW
HE HAD AFFAIRS--

32:44.490 --> 32:45.422
EVEN MY MOTHER--
BUT NOBODY

32:45.460 --> 32:48.258
TALKED ABOUT IT, SO I
DECIDED TO CONFRONT HIM.

32:48.300 --> 32:52.066
AND I FOLLOWED HIM--
THE LAWYER'S,

32:52.100 --> 32:53.761
THE DOCTOR'S...

32:53.800 --> 32:56.598
THE BAN KS,
THE WEIGHT-LOSS,

32:56.640 --> 32:59.131
AND IT ALL CAME BACK.

32:59.170 --> 33:02.139
HE HAD LUNG CANCER.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.378
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT BENZENE IS?

33:07.410 --> 33:10.140
I KNOW IT CAUSES CANCER.

33:10.180 --> 33:13.388
LEUKEMIA.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.514
IT'S ALSO HIGHLY
FLAMMABLE.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.687
THEY KEPT IT IN
UNDERGROUND TANKS.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.051
IT'S EXPENSIVE
TO CLEAN UP--

33:21.100 --> 33:23.091
CHEAPER TO HIDE.

33:23.130 --> 33:25.462
MY SPECIALTY.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.697
MOST OF THE PROPERTIES
WERE ZONED "CR",

33:28.740 --> 33:32.437
COMMERCIAL--WAREHOUSES
WHERE NOBODY WORKED,

33:32.470 --> 33:34.609
SO WHAT'S THE HARM,
RIGHT?

33:34.640 --> 33:39.339
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT
ONE OF THOSE JOBS

33:39.380 --> 33:44.215
WAS SOLD
AND REZONED "ES".

33:44.250 --> 33:46.514
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

33:46.550 --> 33:48.381
AND YOU DIDN'T REPORT IT?

33:48.420 --> 33:52.049
I REPORT IT,
THEY COME AI-TER ME...

33:52.090 --> 33:54.058
AND I LEAVE NOTHING
FOR MY SON.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.159
THAT'S WHY
I STARTED THE EDF,

33:56.200 --> 33:57.553
THE L.U.S.T. LIST.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.524
I WAS TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.390
YOU STILL CAN.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.237
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

34:04.270 --> 34:07.808
HE WAS AT YOUR HOUSE
LAST NIGHT...

34:07.840 --> 34:08.829
AND HE WAS ANGRY.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.609
EVERYBODY WAS
ANGRY LAST NIGHT,

34:10.640 --> 34:12.642
THEY WERE FURIOUS THAT
I SHUT IT ALL DOWN.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.717
HE WAS ANGRY FOR
A DIFFERENT REASON.

34:15.750 --> 34:16.648
WHAT YOU SAID
ENRAGED HIM.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.717
BUT HE'S A COWARD, HE
WOULDN'T CONFRONT YOU.

34:19.750 --> 34:20.785
HE WAS PROBABLY
THE ONLY ONE WHO

34:20.820 --> 34:22.082
WASN'T ANGRY
AT THE TIME.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.554
HE DIDN'T EXPRESS
ANYTHING...

34:24.590 --> 34:27.127
UNTIL Al-TER HE LEI-T.

34:33.730 --> 34:36.631
VINCENT STILES.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.806
THANK YOU.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.441
VINCENT STILES.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.414
ABBY'S LEAVING,
KEEP A TRAIL ON HIM

34:50.450 --> 34:52.645
UNTIL WE HAVE STILES
JUST TO BE SURE.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.749
COPY THAT.
I HAVE ABBY.

35:33.930 --> 35:34.897
CLEAR.

35:34.930 --> 35:36.898
GIDEON, HE'S NOT HERE.

35:41.700 --> 35:44.168
HE GOT THE COMPANY NAMES
FROM THE EDF WEBSITE,

35:44.210 --> 35:46.929
THEN HE WATCHED THE OFFICES
UNTIL HE FOUND EMPLOYEES

35:46.970 --> 35:47.766
THAT SUITED HIS TASTE.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.631
HE JUST LEI-T. A NEIGHBOR
SAW HIM LEAVE.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.545
HE'S A PHARMACEUTICAL
SALES REP, HE'S BEEN

35:52.580 --> 35:54.616
LIVING HERE SINCE
HIS DIVORCE 6 WEEKS AGO.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.845
THAT'S THE STRESSOR.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.518
YEAH, TALK TO ME.

35:58.550 --> 36:00.381
YEAH, I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.148
WHAT?

36:01.190 --> 36:04.853
ABBY SHOOK THE TAIL
WE HAD ON HIM.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.905
BET YOU WERE AFRAID
I WASN'T COMING, HUH?

36:21.940 --> 36:23.805
LOOK.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.775
THOSE THINGS THAT
I SAID ABOUT YOU...

36:26.810 --> 36:27.799
I'M SORRY.

36:27.850 --> 36:30.910
I HAD TO SAY THEM.

36:31.550 --> 36:33.814
I KNOW...

36:33.850 --> 36:34.851
YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.778
A GENIUS.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.549
I APPRECIATE YOUR
TRUE VALUE.

36:38.590 --> 36:42.959
SO WHAT, YOU JUST CAME
HERE TO APOLOGIZE?

36:43.000 --> 36:43.853
NO...

36:43.900 --> 36:47.290
I CAME HERE BECAUSE
I RESPECT YOUR TALENT.

36:47.330 --> 36:51.437
AND I WANT TO TAKE
FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.787
GARCIA CHECKED
ABBY'S PHONE RECORDS,

37:10.820 --> 37:13.653
AND HE CALLED STILES
RIGHT AFTER I LEI-T HIM.

37:13.690 --> 37:17.854
WELL, YOU SAW SOMEONE
ABBY IDENTIFIED WITH.

37:19.730 --> 37:22.335
I CATCH KILLERS,
I SAVE LIVES, I'M A HERO,

37:22.370 --> 37:23.735
UNTIL MY KEY HITS
MY FRONT DOOR,

37:23.770 --> 37:26.034
AND THEN I'M JUST
THE FATHER AND THE HUSBAND

37:26.070 --> 37:27.332
WHO'S NEVER THERE.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.906
I GOT THAT ONE.

37:28.940 --> 37:29.770
HERE'S THE THING.

37:29.810 --> 37:34.008
WHEN I'M HOME, I'M IN
THIS SILENT PANIC

37:34.050 --> 37:35.972
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
I HAVE TO BE

37:36.020 --> 37:38.011
AS GOOD AS I CAN
AS FAST AS I CAN,

37:38.050 --> 37:39.984
BECAUSE ANY MINUTE
THE PHONE IS GONNA RING

37:40.020 --> 37:40.941
AND MY TIME IS UP,

37:40.990 --> 37:41.911
AND THAT PANIC IS EXACTLY
WHAT I SAW IN ABBY.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.282
GOOD. YOU'RE ABBY.
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN
WALKING,

37:45.330 --> 37:46.149
YOU GOTTA MAKE
THIS RIGHT.

37:46.190 --> 37:47.657
YOU HAVE NO TIME LEI-T,
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

37:47.690 --> 37:48.850
COME ON,
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,

37:48.900 --> 37:50.356
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.
WHAT IS IT?

37:50.400 --> 37:51.867
I'D STOP HIM.
HOW?

37:51.900 --> 37:54.061
I'D BURN HIM.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.534
THE SAME WAY
HE KILLED THEM.

37:56.570 --> 38:00.301
I'D DO IT WHERE
NOBODY COULD GET HURT.

38:00.340 --> 38:03.537
WHICH IS WHY I WOULD
CALL IT IN FIRST.

38:04.910 --> 38:06.901
WE GOT A 9-1-1
ANONYMOUS TIP FOR

38:06.950 --> 38:08.349
A FIRE IN
THE HARBOR DISTRICT.

38:08.380 --> 38:08.971
IS IT A WAREHOUSE?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.817
YEAH.
6000 SAN ALAMEDA.

38:10.850 --> 38:11.839
CAN YOU
CALL GARCIA?

38:11.890 --> 38:12.811
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

38:12.850 --> 38:13.987
HEY, GARCIA, CAN YOU CHECK
THE ZONING CODE ON

38:14.020 --> 38:16.318
A WAREHOUSE AT
6000 SAN ALAMEDA?

38:16.360 --> 38:17.213
YEAH, I CERTAINLY CAN.

38:17.260 --> 38:19.683
THE SFPD CHOPPER CIRCLED
THE HARBOR TWICE.

38:19.730 --> 38:20.788
THERE'S NO SIGN OF FIRE.

38:20.830 --> 38:22.695
OK, 6000 SAN ALAMEDA

38:22.730 --> 38:24.493
IS A COMMERCIAL
STORAGE FACILITY.

38:24.530 --> 38:26.669
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THE PROPERTY WAS JUST SOLD

38:26.700 --> 38:29.032
AND THE LOT WAS APPROVED
FOR ZONE CONVERSION.

38:29.070 --> 38:30.059
"CR" TO ll ES" I

38:30.100 --> 38:31.362
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.229
"CR", COMMERCIAL,
WHAT'S "ES"?

38:32.270 --> 38:33.305
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
AND THERE'S A LEAKING

38:33.340 --> 38:36.002
BENZENE TANK UNDERNEATH IT.
IT'S NOT A FALSE ALARM.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.769
BUT THERE'S
NO FIRE THERE.

38:37.810 --> 38:40.074
THERE'S ABOUT TO BE.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.054
I STARTED
WITHOUT YOU.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.060
THIS IS HOW YOU
DO IT, RIGHT?

38:59.100 --> 39:01.125
WELL, FIRE'S A FIRE.

39:01.170 --> 39:05.607
ONCE IT GETS GOING,
IT DON'T MATTER.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.406
THAT'S NOT--

39:07.440 --> 39:10.102
THAT'S NOT REALLY
TRUE, THOUGH, IS IT?

39:11.110 --> 39:13.476
HA HA! I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.569
THERE'S SOMETHING
MISSING FROM

39:15.620 --> 39:17.838
THIS SCENARIO,
DON'T YOU THINK?

39:18.450 --> 39:20.884
I'M SORRY, YOU LOST ME.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.081
THE INNOCENT FAMILY.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.758
YOU KNOW,
THE VICTIMS.

39:24.790 --> 39:27.122
THAT'S WHAT
THE SUIT'S FOR, RIGHT?

39:27.160 --> 39:30.493
SO YOU CAN SEE THE
TERROR ON THEIR FACES

39:30.530 --> 39:32.122
AS THEY BURN?

39:34.770 --> 39:35.759
BUT OF COURSE, THEN,

39:35.800 --> 39:39.031
YOU'RE HERE TO
KILL ME, RIGHT?

39:44.450 --> 39:46.441
YOU'RE DEAD RIGHT.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.509
WE CAN'T PUT A BENZENE FIRE
OUT WITH WATER.

39:52.550 --> 39:54.518
ALL WATER DOES
IS SPREAD IT AROUND,

39:54.560 --> 39:55.686
IT BURNS TOO HOT.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.415
CONTAMINATES
THE GROUND TABLE.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.087
SO WE'LL
LET IT BURN.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.028
WE EXHAUST THE FUEL.

40:00.060 --> 40:00.879
ALL WE CAN DO IS CORDON
IT OFF, STOP IT FROM

40:00.930 --> 40:03.455
SPREADING, AND LET
THE BENZENE BURN OUT.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.489
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

40:04.530 --> 40:05.519
YEAH, I GOT IT.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.925
DOES HOTCHNER?

40:08.770 --> 40:09.532
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

40:09.570 --> 40:12.562
DON'T PUT ME ON SPEAKER.
JUST LISTEN.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.032
WELL, YOU KNOW,

40:14.070 --> 40:15.207
YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND SHOOT ME,

40:15.240 --> 40:19.449
AND THEN YOU SET THIS
PLACE OFF LIKE A BOMB.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.869
NO?

40:23.920 --> 40:25.683
HMM.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.052
WHA--

40:30.090 --> 40:34.186
YOU KNOW, THIS SUIT CAN
HANDLE OVER 1,500 DEGREES.

40:34.230 --> 40:36.050
BENZENE BURNS SO FAST,

40:36.100 --> 40:38.227
I WON'T GO THROUGH HALF
MY AIR BEFORE IT GOES OUT.

40:38.260 --> 40:41.161
OH, YOU WON'T EVEN GO
THROUGH THAT MUCH.

40:41.200 --> 40:45.569
SEE, BENZENE BURNS
AT TWICE THAT.

40:46.670 --> 40:49.503
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:50.580 --> 40:51.399
THE RIGHT THING.

40:51.440 --> 40:55.046
WHY? YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.945
NEITHER DID YOU!

40:56.980 --> 40:58.811
THIS FIRE WILL SPREAD!

40:58.850 --> 41:00.841
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S
ON ITS WAY.

41:00.890 --> 41:03.484
THEY CAN'T FIGHT
A BENZENE FIRE.

41:03.520 --> 41:04.680
THEY'LL CONTAIN IT.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.482
SERIOUSLY, WHAT--

41:06.530 --> 41:09.158
HOW DO YOU PLAN ON
GETTING OUT OF HERE?

41:13.830 --> 41:15.639
I DON'T.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.707
6000 BLOCK
OF SAN ALAMEDA--

41:33.820 --> 41:36.687
MORGAN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

41:36.720 --> 41:40.656
HOTCH, IT'S TOO LATE,
MAN, I'M SORRY.

41:41.930 --> 41:44.228
HOTCH--STOP!
STOP, STOP!

41:44.260 --> 41:46.763
HE'S BURNING TO DEATH
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA STAND HERE?

41:46.800 --> 41:49.928
LOOK AT IT, MAN!
IT'S OVER!

41:58.710 --> 42:02.271
HE WANTED HIS DEATH
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.725
AUTHORITIES HAVE
ASSURED US THAT BENZENE

42:19.770 --> 42:21.567
POSES NO IMMEDIATE
THREAT TO THE AREA,

42:21.600 --> 42:24.899
AND FIRE OFFICIALS SAY SO FAR
THE ONLY KNOWN FATALITIES

42:24.940 --> 42:26.305
APPEAR TO BE THE TWO ARSONISTS

42:26.340 --> 42:29.969
WHO HAVE YET
TO BE IDENTIFIED.

42:35.050 --> 42:38.247
I FOUND THIS
IN ABBY'S CAR.

42:50.760 --> 42:51.556
GANDHI SAID,

42:51.600 --> 42:54.728
"LIVE AS IF YOU WERE TO
DIE TOMORROW.

42:54.770 --> 42:58.365
LEARN AS IF YOU WERE
TO LIVE FOREVER."

42:58.400 --> 43:01.676
HERE HE IS.
THANKS.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.072
MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

43:03.110 --> 43:04.304
IT'S OK, LIAM.

43:04.340 --> 43:06.808
LIAM? MY NAME'S AARON.

43:06.850 --> 43:08.306
I WAS A FRIEND OF
YOUR DAD'S.

43:08.350 --> 43:10.614
I SAW YOU WITH HIM
AT MY PRACTICE.

43:10.650 --> 43:12.015
THAT'S RIGHT.

43:12.050 --> 43:13.745
YOU WEREN'T
AT HIS FUNERAL.

43:13.790 --> 43:15.189
I COULDN'T BE THERE.

43:15.220 --> 43:17.984
I HAD TO BE WITH
MY FAMILY.

43:18.020 --> 43:20.818
BUT I WAS
THINKING OF HIM...

43:20.860 --> 43:22.657
AND YOU.

43:26.170 --> 43:29.298
YOUR DAD ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.408
WHY YOU?

43:34.440 --> 43:35.338
I DON'T KNOW.

43:35.380 --> 43:39.043
MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS
YOUNG WHEN MY DAD DIED.

43:42.150 --> 43:45.813
ANYWAY, YOU MAY HAVE
SOME QUESTIONS...

43:45.850 --> 43:48.284
SOME DAY, AND, UH...

43:48.320 --> 43:50.015
PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO CALL ME,

43:50.060 --> 43:53.621
I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO ANSWER THEM.
