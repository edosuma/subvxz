00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:39.039 --> 00:40.973
Come on, team, you really rock!

00:41.007 --> 00:42.998
Check it out, I have a...

00:45.979 --> 00:48.504
My revenge shall be eternal!

00:50.650 --> 00:54.347
Montezuma,
there shall be no revenge.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.218
Revenge!

00:57.791 --> 01:01.056
- Happy birthday, Calvin.
- A real tiger!

01:01.094 --> 01:03.722
I can't believe you got me
a real live tiger.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.560
OK.

01:05.598 --> 01:09.967
Native Americans would be more plentiful
if they hadn't traded their land for casinos.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.868
Well, cowboys never even existed.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.397
They're just a masculine image
campaign purported by Marlboro.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.910
I think something's wrong with our son.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.139
- This is some bullshit!
- Yeah.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.944
- Who are you talking to?
- To Hobbes, my pet tiger.

01:22.982 --> 01:26.110
- Can't you see him?
- That's just a stuffed animal.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.677
No, it's not. He's real.
Get him, Hobbes.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.416
Blood is everywhere!

01:33.460 --> 01:35.553
The vicious tiger
shows no mercy.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.529
I see.

01:42.535 --> 01:46.096
This is for the best.
Give him these pills every two hours.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.505
Hobbes? Hobbes?

01:49.642 --> 01:51.007
- Calvin.
- Hobbes!

01:51.044 --> 01:54.741
Calvin, your parents don't believe.
We have to kill them.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.480
- Son, did you do this?
- Me? No.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.148
My tiger did.
He's a bloodthirsty monster.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.588
OK, you're coming with us.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.826
Fasten your seatbelt, Hobbes.
We're going to Mars!

02:13.733 --> 02:15.792
Mars is amazing!

02:15.835 --> 02:21.637
Mars is amazing.
Mars is amazing.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.601
¤ Look around ¤

02:24.644 --> 02:27.807
¤ No one's ever gonna knock you down ¤

02:31.184 --> 02:33.812
So this is your two weeks, then?

02:33.853 --> 02:35.115
I see.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.872
Hello?

02:56.910 --> 03:01.279
Grandma! I'm sorry!
No. I must have misdialed!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.953
Revenge!

03:07.987 --> 03:10.387
Yes, yes.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.656
- Cameron!
- Damn it! Not a moment of peace.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.323
You would be justified
in passing me the bread.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.993
It's old, honey.
I just wish that they...

03:22.035 --> 03:23.059
Babe?

03:23.102 --> 03:25.093
I'm afraid it's very serious.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.572
In your career,
have you ever had contact...

03:27.607 --> 03:30.201
with a brand of movie makeup
called Prolactin?

03:30.243 --> 03:31.801
I don't know. What is it?

03:31.844 --> 03:33.675
It's used to make fake semen.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.647
- Crap!
- Well, at any rate...

03:35.682 --> 03:38.446
your body is now 99% cancer.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.714
You have less than a day to live.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.951
Don't worry, baby. I'll find love again.

03:43.990 --> 03:44.979
Thanks.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.653
Is there anything special you want to do
before you, you know, kick it?

03:48.695 --> 03:50.856
As a matter of fact, there is!

03:50.897 --> 03:53.991
That's all right. OK.
You know, I thought maybe we'd cuddle.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.059
Yes?

03:57.103 --> 04:01.369
That's for making Lucy Liu cry
on the set of Charlie's Angels, Bill Murray!

04:03.476 --> 04:04.773
Yes?

04:04.811 --> 04:08.440
That's for giving me cancer
with your fake semen, Ben Stiller!

04:08.481 --> 04:12.076
I was just an actor.
That stuff gave me cancer, too!

04:12.118 --> 04:13.745
Well...

04:13.786 --> 04:15.549
That's for having cancer!

04:18.324 --> 04:19.985
- Yes?
- Where's John Rutter?

04:20.026 --> 04:23.792
I'll hit him in the nuts for blackmailing
me over those topless photos!

04:23.830 --> 04:26.060
You'll have to go visit him in prison!

04:26.099 --> 04:29.068
Yeah. I won that case.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.469
- When does he get out?
- Four years from now!

04:32.505 --> 04:37.169
You win this rounds,
John Rutter's nuts.

04:40.046 --> 04:43.345
Come on,
plenty of Cameron for everybody!

04:43.383 --> 04:45.977
That's right, people. Closer.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.420
You're gonna want
a really good photo of this.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.788
Burn in hell, you dickless ass clowns!

04:55.595 --> 04:58.086
Didn't the dead paparazzi
get a memorial, too?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.655
Yeah. It's right over there.

05:06.873 --> 05:10.866
OK, Mrs. Milano,
just one more big push.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.725
Dinner's ready, boys.
Chili time!

05:28.761 --> 05:31.958
- Straight from New York City.
- New York City?!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.194
Actually, it's pretty good.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.266
Are you guys excited
to meet my fiancé Frank?

05:41.307 --> 05:43.036
I can't wait, sweetie.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.943
I'm not ready
to see my baby get married.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.336
Frankie!

05:48.981 --> 05:50.744
Lord, it's a monster!

05:50.783 --> 05:54.048
Dad, don't shoot!
That's my fiancé.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.749
Sorry about that.
Nice to meet you, Frank.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.053
So, Frank,
what's your line of work?

06:01.194 --> 06:04.891
- What the hell does that mean?
- Honey, be nice.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.058
Honey, watch out!

06:07.100 --> 06:09.466
Dad, he was just trying
to go to the bathroom.

06:09.502 --> 06:13.666
Right. Sorry, Frank.
Toss the ball around?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.282
He's going crazy!

06:28.755 --> 06:32.555
Dad, a beehive fell in his pants.
He's already in pain.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.686
Oh, man!
Sorry again there, Frank.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.753
That's my bad.

06:37.797 --> 06:41.858
You know, I am really
taking a liking to this Frankie guy.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.529
What the hell is that?

06:47.840 --> 06:50.832
You monster!
What are you doing to my daughter?

06:52.545 --> 06:54.410
Dad, we were having sex!

06:54.447 --> 06:57.382
Oh, man, so sorry about that.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.580
Terrible misunderstanding.
I feel awful.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.350
Apologies all around. Carry on.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.054
Honey, I'm so proud
of you finally coming to terms...

07:08.094 --> 07:10.688
with our daughter
marrying Frankenstein.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.063
Franken-stein? He's Jewish?!

07:17.537 --> 07:20.665
Ride My Ass. Quite the bargain.
Good time for the...

07:20.706 --> 07:23.106
Hey, get the kids!
It's a family affair.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.042
Sir, do right by your kids.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.208
Revenge!

07:34.487 --> 07:37.479
- So what have you guys been up to?
- Got a new bell yesterday.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.821
- A new bell!
- Loving it. Really cool jingle.

07:43.930 --> 07:47.058
No, Mario,
the bridge, she's closed!

07:48.701 --> 07:51.431
Which way should we go?

07:56.242 --> 07:59.040
Look at that. We got a flat tire.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.445
Look, a repair garage.
I'll pull in there.

08:06.686 --> 08:10.645
Mama mia!
Luigi, we got a pimped out ride.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.260
We need some coins, Mario.
We have no money.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.230
Leave to me!

08:21.234 --> 08:23.862
Mario! Are you OK?

08:23.903 --> 08:25.029
Look, it's a turtle.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.969
What are you doing?!
You just killed my turtle!

08:30.009 --> 08:34.241
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
- Hey, what's going on here?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.475
Luigi, let's get out of here!

08:39.385 --> 08:41.909
Look, Luigi, it's the Princess.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.548
Princess, you must come with us.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.615
I'll suck your c... for 50 bucks.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.127
- Princess!
- Do you accept coins?

08:49.161 --> 08:52.562
Come on, Princess,
we got the gold.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.498
No, that's my princess.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.866
No. I'm hit.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.531
- What is this?
- That's blood, baby.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.700
Mario, we need to find you
some mushrooms so you can heal.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.573
I know just the guy.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.375
This is some really good shit man.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.313
I feel really good!
Look at the pretty colors!

09:18.357 --> 09:21.019
Cheese it! It's the fuzz!

09:23.763 --> 09:25.697
I feel so funny.

09:25.731 --> 09:30.168
Look, there's coins everywhere. I'm rich!

09:30.202 --> 09:31.692
Mario, no!

09:33.005 --> 09:34.939
No, Mario, no!

09:36.742 --> 09:38.710
I think I should drive!

09:41.347 --> 09:43.781
Freeze!
Put your hands in the air!

09:43.816 --> 09:45.909
He's got a wrench!
Take him down!

09:45.952 --> 09:47.112
No!

09:47.153 --> 09:48.552
Mama mia!

09:48.588 --> 09:52.456
He's marinating in his own ragu!

09:52.491 --> 09:56.723
You killed my brother!
You sons of a bitches!

10:04.904 --> 10:09.204
You'll never take me alive,
you mother...!

10:26.025 --> 10:28.687
Raccoon City sounds lovely.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.556
What? What?
