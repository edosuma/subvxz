WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:03.200
I'm Hank. And I'm a
different kind of doctor.

00:03.225 --> 00:04.925
Here's what happened to me last summer.

00:04.950 --> 00:07.650
I got fired from my job as
an E.R. doctor in Brooklyn

00:07.701 --> 00:10.603
for refusing to let a rich
patient cut the line.

00:10.605 --> 00:13.072
Then I got dumped by my fiancee.

00:13.074 --> 00:15.641
I went out to the Hamptons
with my brother, Evan,

00:15.643 --> 00:18.138
and met a mysterious
billionaire named Boris,

00:18.140 --> 00:20.463
who set us up in a cottage on his estate.

00:20.465 --> 00:23.065
Along with Divya, a determined
physician assistant,

00:23.067 --> 00:25.668
we started a concierge medical practice,

00:25.670 --> 00:27.535
healing the rich and famous.

00:27.537 --> 00:30.371
I also met Jill, the
hospital administrator,

00:30.373 --> 00:32.049
and helped her start a free clinic

00:32.051 --> 00:33.118
for the locals out here.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.688
Jill and I had an on-again, off-again,

00:35.690 --> 00:37.060
on-again romance.

00:37.062 --> 00:38.498
As last summer came to a close,

00:38.500 --> 00:40.400
everyone went their separate ways.

00:40.402 --> 00:43.609
I stayed behind to keep
an eye on my patients

00:43.611 --> 00:45.645
and unwind from a few very hectic months.

00:45.647 --> 00:47.582
But winter came and went pretty quickly,

00:47.584 --> 00:49.317
which brings us to today...

00:49.319 --> 00:53.489
the first day of a brand-new summer.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:05.266 --> 01:07.636
Shaver's remorse.

01:07.638 --> 01:10.638
I kind of got used to all that extra fur.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.974
Ah, you don't need it anymore, Hank.

01:14.148 --> 01:15.381
Uh, it's $30 now.

01:15.383 --> 01:17.617
$30? Franco, it was $10 a few weeks ago.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.119
It was $10 a few hours ago.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.755
All right.

01:22.793 --> 01:24.495
Ooh, nice haircut, doctor.

01:24.497 --> 01:25.931
How do I look?

01:25.933 --> 01:27.833
Like a victim of highway robbery.

01:27.835 --> 01:28.835
How much did you pay?

01:28.837 --> 01:30.271
More than usual, less than you.

01:30.273 --> 01:32.108
Well, Paige is worth every penny.

01:32.110 --> 01:33.843
You think she's with you for your hair?

01:33.845 --> 01:35.445
Well, she gets back today,

01:35.447 --> 01:37.348
and everything at her party
should be perfect...

01:37.350 --> 01:38.750
everything, especially me.

01:38.752 --> 01:40.018
Party? What party?

01:40.020 --> 01:41.420
The one I'm throwing her today.

01:41.422 --> 01:42.722
Ev, you throw her a party

01:42.724 --> 01:44.223
every time she gets back from a trip,

01:44.225 --> 01:45.524
and she takes a lot of trips.

01:45.526 --> 01:49.464
I know. I... I... I wanna
incentivize her to come home.

01:49.466 --> 01:50.866
It's my dangling carrot.

01:50.868 --> 01:53.536
And how big will today's carrot be?

01:53.538 --> 01:55.839
Today's carrot will be very exclusive...

01:55.841 --> 01:56.974
- Honestly.
- Okay.

01:56.976 --> 01:58.476
You, me, me...

01:58.478 --> 02:00.412
Remind me why we need a P.O. Box.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.014
Uh, you want our patients to know

02:02.016 --> 02:03.515
we're still crashing at Newberg's?

02:03.517 --> 02:04.884
Better than them thinking we run

02:04.886 --> 02:06.286
a mail-order medical practice.

02:06.288 --> 02:08.354
This is for me, me, me.

02:08.357 --> 02:11.358
Oh, this cool one's for you.
Just kidding. It's for me!

02:11.360 --> 02:12.426
Me...

02:12.428 --> 02:14.662
Me...

02:14.664 --> 02:16.864
Oh, check it out... it's a postcard.

02:16.866 --> 02:18.232
Who sent a postcard?

02:18.234 --> 02:20.334
Jill... From Uruguay.

02:20.336 --> 02:21.702
Jill sent you a postcard?

02:21.704 --> 02:23.170
No, she sent it to you.

02:23.172 --> 02:24.772
Then why are you reading it?

02:24.774 --> 02:26.140
It's a postcard.

02:26.142 --> 02:29.810
You want privacy, tell her
to spring for an envelope.

02:31.446 --> 02:33.048
I wonder what her "big news" is.

02:33.050 --> 02:34.316
Yeah.

02:34.318 --> 02:36.685
Me too.

02:36.687 --> 02:37.820
Me...

02:37.822 --> 02:40.190
You, and...

02:40.192 --> 02:42.193
"occupant".

02:42.195 --> 02:44.662
Looks like summer has arrived.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.500
Her name is Divya.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.740
Hi, Divya.

02:53.742 --> 02:55.709
Isn't it a bit early for lunch?

02:55.711 --> 02:57.911
I haven't worked up an appetite just yet.

03:06.556 --> 03:08.991
Divya, check those two drivers.

03:12.030 --> 03:13.763
Miss, wait. Are you hurt?

03:13.765 --> 03:15.832
I don't think so.
I hit the brakes just in time.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.634
Call 911. Tell them
we have a bus collision

03:17.636 --> 03:18.869
with possible injuries.

03:18.871 --> 03:20.204
Got it. Where are you going?

03:20.206 --> 03:21.238
In there.

03:24.644 --> 03:28.147
Excuse me. Just coming in.

03:28.149 --> 03:30.850
Hi. Hi.

03:30.852 --> 03:32.652
Everyone, please stay still.
I'm a doctor.

03:32.654 --> 03:34.788
I'm gonna make sure
you're all okay one at a time.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.484
All right, ambulances are en route.

03:36.486 --> 03:37.724
I ordered a few, just in case.

03:37.726 --> 03:39.159
Evan? Evan, what are you doing in here?

03:39.161 --> 03:41.061
When you come in,
we come in behind you, man.

03:41.063 --> 03:43.930
- We?
- Both drivers are okay...

03:43.932 --> 03:45.966
just a little shaken.

03:45.968 --> 03:48.535
The woman promised to call
if anything pops up.

03:48.537 --> 03:51.071
Divya, triage
from the other end of the bus.

03:51.073 --> 03:54.041
Anyone who can exit safely,
come up to this window, please.

03:54.043 --> 03:56.344
Ev, there are people outside
who can help you off-load.

03:56.346 --> 03:57.545
- Okay.
- Can I help?

03:57.547 --> 03:58.813
Do you know what happened?

03:58.815 --> 04:01.282
Yeah, about 250 grand worth
of midlife crisis

04:01.284 --> 04:03.585
came straight at me, and I had to swerve.

04:03.587 --> 04:04.987
Uh, what's the plan?

04:04.989 --> 04:06.221
The door is jammed. It won't open.

04:06.223 --> 04:07.990
Yeah, I saw. Can you pop another window?

04:07.992 --> 04:10.859
Yeah, I'll give it my best try.

04:10.861 --> 04:12.494
Aah! Aah!

04:12.496 --> 04:14.230
Okay, okay, stay still, sir.

04:14.232 --> 04:16.332
Stay still. Where's the pain?

04:16.334 --> 04:19.302
Oh! My left leg is killing me!

04:20.303 --> 04:21.837
Aah!

04:21.839 --> 04:24.774
Okay, okay. All right.

04:28.879 --> 04:31.013
- What's your name?
- Rob.

04:31.015 --> 04:33.015
Rob, you fractured your femur.

04:33.017 --> 04:36.018
- Ev, is everyone else out?
- Uh, just a couple more to go.

04:36.020 --> 04:38.754
Okay, good, good.
I need you over here now.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.255
Come here.

04:40.257 --> 04:42.357
Okay, Rob, this is my brother, Evan.

04:42.359 --> 04:43.925
He's gonna be your temporary splint.

04:43.927 --> 04:45.027
- What?
- What!?

04:45.029 --> 04:46.728
It's called a human-hare splint.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.097
Okay, now, sit down.

04:48.099 --> 04:51.400
Okay, good.

04:51.402 --> 04:52.801
That's it.

04:52.803 --> 04:55.104
Extend your left leg
till your foot hits this pillow.

04:55.106 --> 04:56.772
- Now grab his ankle...
- Okay.

04:56.774 --> 04:59.242
And extend your back
till you're lying on the floor.

04:59.244 --> 05:01.511
- What?
- Just lie down.

05:01.513 --> 05:03.079
Good. Now, use all your strength

05:03.081 --> 05:04.581
to keep his leg completely straight.

05:04.583 --> 05:05.915
But that's gonna really hu...

05:05.917 --> 05:06.916
- Now.
- Aah!

05:06.918 --> 05:09.652
Okay.

05:09.654 --> 05:12.288
Oh. Oh, my God.
Oh, that's so much better.

05:12.290 --> 05:13.823
Hank!

05:13.825 --> 05:16.092
Good. Now, just hold him
till I tell you to stop.

05:16.094 --> 05:17.260
Hank!

05:17.262 --> 05:20.163
We were helping the last passenger out.

05:20.165 --> 05:24.234
He just doubled over in pain
and then just collapsed.

05:30.908 --> 05:32.308
He got impaled
with a piece of broken glass.

05:32.310 --> 05:34.677
I had a bottle of iced tea in my lap.

05:34.679 --> 05:36.613
I didn't feel anything till just now.

05:36.615 --> 05:38.515
Your adrenaline was masking the pain.

05:38.517 --> 05:40.217
Helping the passengers out
probably opened the wound.

05:40.219 --> 05:42.920
I managed to get a 16 into his hand.

05:42.922 --> 05:44.622
He's 60 systolic.

05:44.624 --> 05:46.323
His B.P. is crashing fast.

05:46.325 --> 05:48.359
All right, hand me a tourniquet...

05:48.361 --> 05:50.527
and open up the line.

05:50.529 --> 05:53.096
I'm just looking for a vein.

05:53.098 --> 05:54.564
Veins are collapsed.

05:54.566 --> 05:57.334
- Uh, give me a 14 angio...
- Okay.

05:57.336 --> 05:59.268
and set up another line, quickly.

05:59.270 --> 06:00.670
But you said that his veins...

06:00.672 --> 06:01.771
There's one more I can try...

06:01.773 --> 06:04.073
- his jugular.
- Okay.

06:04.075 --> 06:05.641
Let's elevate his legs.

06:05.643 --> 06:08.277
Okay. The blood from his legs
will pool in his upper body

06:08.279 --> 06:09.511
and dilate the vein.

06:09.513 --> 06:11.113
We should be able to get him
some volume fast.

06:11.115 --> 06:12.615
And that will get his B.P. back up.

06:12.617 --> 06:13.816
Exactly.

06:13.818 --> 06:14.884
Okay.

06:20.459 --> 06:24.329
Inserting the angio needle
into his jugular vein.

06:24.331 --> 06:25.664
Okay, we got it.

06:25.666 --> 06:28.533
Line, please.

06:28.535 --> 06:31.870
Okay, I'm opening up the line.

06:37.677 --> 06:40.044
- What happened?
- You just took a little nap.

06:40.046 --> 06:41.679
Now we have to rush you to the hospital.

06:41.681 --> 06:44.181
You're gonna be okay.

06:44.183 --> 06:45.349
Gonna be okay.

06:52.156 --> 06:54.791
Yeah. Hank! Hank, come!

06:54.793 --> 06:56.760
Come on, come on. Hey, guys.

06:56.762 --> 06:59.363
Hey, it's the Mayor of Southampton!

06:59.365 --> 07:01.265
Hi. I've always wanted to meet you, sir.

07:01.267 --> 07:03.167
Pleasure. So, yeah, it's not just me.

07:03.169 --> 07:05.669
That's my brother, Hank Lawson.
I'm Evan. R. Lawson.

07:05.671 --> 07:08.538
That's Divya Katdare,
and together, we are Hankmed.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.207
Hank! So, okay, great.

07:10.209 --> 07:12.242
So, uh, great.
These are my business cards.

07:12.244 --> 07:14.311
Mayor, uh, maybe
you can hand 'em around, bud.

07:14.313 --> 07:15.412
Thanks a lot!

Welcome home!

07:52.104 --> 07:54.404
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

07:54.406 --> 07:56.439
O... kay.

07:56.441 --> 07:57.940
Oh, my God, the party...

07:57.942 --> 07:59.075
I totally forgot.

07:59.077 --> 08:00.576
The rest of the Hamptons didn't.

08:00.578 --> 08:03.512
Yeah. Um, I did not invite
this many people.

08:03.514 --> 08:04.914
Oh, word of a party got out... shocking.

08:04.916 --> 08:07.516
Um... [clears throat] hi, yeah.

08:07.518 --> 08:09.920
Uh, thank you so much for coming, guys.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.421
Uh, sorry I'm late.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.590
It's just there were lives
in town that needed saving,

08:13.592 --> 08:15.426
and as the CFO of Hankmed,

08:15.428 --> 08:18.997
I'm basically... I... I basically just
do whatever needs to be done.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.932
If I'm there and kind of danger...

08:20.934 --> 08:23.001
danger comes up, then I'm there.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.936
But my brother... Hank, why don't you...

08:32.811 --> 08:36.246
Just a few of your close friends, huh?

08:36.249 --> 08:38.750
I didn't even do it.
Word just got out.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.186
I think you used the wrong word.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.288
- Oh, God.
- What?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.157
The queen of the castle's back.

08:45.159 --> 08:46.291
Oh, boy.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.426
You know what?
I think that I need a drink.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.763
- Good luck, Evan.
- Thank you.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.131
- Hi, Divya.
- Hello, Ms. Newberg.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.367
I'm so happy to be back with my boys.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.635
And thank you for letting us

08:57.637 --> 08:59.371
stay here this winter, Ms. Newberg.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.806
This is totally the first party

09:00.808 --> 09:02.441
I've ever thrown here, too, by the way.

09:02.443 --> 09:05.310
Oh, I love a good summer
starter, especially a big one.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.312
It just oozes sexiness...

09:07.314 --> 09:09.180
Which reminds me,
your father called from prison.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.382
That's a fun segue.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.750
How did he sound?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.218
He sounds fine. He sends his love.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.453
It's just that...

09:14.455 --> 09:15.754
He still doesn't want any visitors.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.955
Your father has a lot of pride.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.323
Well, we don't want to take his pride.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.791
- We just want to see him.
- Yeah.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.360
Well, he doesn't want to be seen as is.

09:21.362 --> 09:23.696
And neither do you, by the way.

09:23.698 --> 09:24.830
Let me tuck this in.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.398
Oh, no, no, no, I really... no, no.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.667
Ms. Newberg! Aah, that's
a little too deep, okay?

09:28.669 --> 09:30.736
- Car pulling up!
- Paige is here!

09:30.738 --> 09:32.405
Oh, my God, she's here. Good.

09:32.407 --> 09:33.639
Okay, guys, guys! Everybody, guys!

09:33.641 --> 09:35.141
She's here! Guys!

09:35.143 --> 09:36.342
It's time! Guys, she's...

09:36.344 --> 09:38.077
Everybody... everybody, shut up!

09:38.079 --> 09:39.145
Okay, great.

09:39.147 --> 09:41.213
So, inside, places right now, okay?

09:41.215 --> 09:42.682
This is great. Right now! Let's go!

09:42.684 --> 09:44.317
Okay, thanks a lot.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.920
Yeah, come on in.

09:47.922 --> 09:50.790
Welcome home!

09:50.792 --> 09:52.058
- Jill.
- Jill?

09:52.060 --> 09:53.860
Oh, wow.

09:53.862 --> 09:55.595
Oh, you guys shouldn't have.

09:55.597 --> 09:57.363
Yeah, we didn't, actually,
but here you go.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.132
It's good to see you, Jill. Welcome back.

09:59.134 --> 10:02.301
It's good to see you, too.

10:02.303 --> 10:04.203
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:04.205 --> 10:06.739
I had no idea you were getting
back from Uruguay today.

10:06.741 --> 10:08.374
Yeah, surprise.

10:08.376 --> 10:11.076
Surprise.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.211
So did you get my postcard?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.312
I did.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.514
Okay. Can we talk about it later

10:16.516 --> 10:19.116
when we have a little bit more privacy?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.717
Of course.

10:20.719 --> 10:22.888
- Okay.
- Of course.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.224
- How was the trip?
- Hey, what's up?

10:26.526 --> 10:30.229
Paige got held up
putting out a family fire.

10:30.231 --> 10:31.497
She's not making it.

10:31.499 --> 10:33.799
Did you tell her about the haircut?

10:36.371 --> 10:37.904
Ev.

10:47.782 --> 10:50.283
Marisa.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.488
It's good to see you.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.993
And it's good to see all of you.

11:00.995 --> 11:03.329
I understood you wanted a conversation,

11:03.331 --> 11:04.931
not a convention.

11:06.100 --> 11:10.003
Give us a moment, gentlemen, please.

11:13.809 --> 11:16.344
Come, sit down.

11:26.622 --> 11:28.389
How have you been?

11:28.391 --> 11:30.792
That's why you summoned me...

11:30.794 --> 11:32.460
to ask what's shaking?

11:34.363 --> 11:35.964
No.

11:35.966 --> 11:38.367
I want to give you this.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.508
What are you doing, Boris?

11:45.510 --> 11:47.311
I am accepting financial

11:47.313 --> 11:50.380
and legal responsibility for the baby.

11:50.382 --> 11:53.083
I want it to be provided for.

11:53.085 --> 11:56.621
I want it to bear my family name.

11:56.623 --> 11:58.690
I... want it to be protected.

11:58.692 --> 12:02.060
And what does our baby
need to be protected from?

12:02.062 --> 12:04.095
Marisa, there are some in my family

12:04.097 --> 12:07.332
who might challenge the idea of a new heir,

12:07.334 --> 12:09.900
you understand?

12:09.902 --> 12:12.836
It's a necessary precaution.

12:12.838 --> 12:15.872
All you have to do is...

12:15.874 --> 12:17.674
review and sign,

12:17.676 --> 12:19.776
when... whenever you're ready, of course.

12:19.778 --> 12:23.045
I'm sure the terms are very generous,

12:23.047 --> 12:25.682
but this is not about a trust fund

12:25.684 --> 12:27.450
or a prestigious surname.

12:27.452 --> 12:29.085
What is this about?

12:29.087 --> 12:30.320
This is about you

12:30.322 --> 12:32.989
taking personal responsibility
for our child.

12:34.392 --> 12:37.528
Boris...

12:37.530 --> 12:39.563
please stop pushing

12:39.565 --> 12:42.132
the people closest to you
farther and farther away.

12:42.134 --> 12:43.533
I did not push you away. You left.

12:43.535 --> 12:45.602
You did it with Hank.
You did it with me.

12:45.604 --> 12:48.172
And I will not let you do this
with our baby.

12:48.174 --> 12:50.240
Marisa.

12:50.242 --> 12:52.309
- Ahh.
- Marisa.

12:52.311 --> 12:53.945
<i>¿Que te pasa?</i>

12:53.947 --> 12:56.615
Marisa!

12:59.486 --> 13:01.786
Dieter!

13:01.788 --> 13:05.923
Well, I spent the winter here,
treating patients with Hank.

13:05.925 --> 13:08.259
It's quiet out here in the off-season, huh?

13:08.261 --> 13:11.094
Just what I needed after Raj.

13:11.096 --> 13:13.596
How are things with your parents?

13:13.598 --> 13:15.998
My parents have been in London.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.234
Ah. They haven't spoken to you.

13:18.236 --> 13:20.102
Oh, we spoke once,

13:20.104 --> 13:22.004
when I called them
to tell them the C.D.C.

13:22.006 --> 13:25.942
released me and Raj
with a clean bill of health.

13:25.944 --> 13:28.345
Divya, I'm sorry.
They'll come around eventually.

13:28.347 --> 13:29.813
Any idea when?

13:29.815 --> 13:31.282
They're your parents.

13:31.284 --> 13:33.117
They're supposed to test your patience.

13:33.119 --> 13:36.421
And, you, how was Europe with Paige?

13:36.423 --> 13:39.124
Epic. It was epic...

13:39.126 --> 13:40.826
Though I haven't spent more than
a week with her since then.

13:40.828 --> 13:42.327
She travels like a rock star. It's crazy.

13:42.329 --> 13:44.796
Hey, you're dating in the jet set now.

13:44.798 --> 13:46.631
I'll be there as soon as I can.

13:46.633 --> 13:48.266
Boris.

13:48.268 --> 13:50.067
I thought he kicked you guys out.

13:50.069 --> 13:51.903
- He did.
- When did you patch things up?

13:51.905 --> 13:54.471
- We didn't.
- Oh.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.480
Go on in.

14:03.482 --> 14:04.949
Good. Hank.

14:04.951 --> 14:07.585
- What's wrong?
- It's not me.

14:07.587 --> 14:09.954
Marisa? She's here?

14:09.956 --> 14:12.390
I think she's in labor, but, uh,

14:12.392 --> 14:14.126
of course she disagrees with me

14:14.128 --> 14:15.628
and refuses to go to the hospital,

14:15.630 --> 14:17.763
I must tell you, my helicopter
is on standby if needed.

14:17.765 --> 14:19.765
Boris, I'm happy to examine her,

14:19.767 --> 14:22.335
but I'll need you to wait out here.

14:22.337 --> 14:24.837
Yeah, yeah.

14:27.875 --> 14:31.010
I'm sure it's just Braxton hicks...

14:31.012 --> 14:34.347
exacerbated by parental anxiety.

14:34.349 --> 14:36.683
Okay, tell me about the contractions.

14:36.685 --> 14:39.419
Non-rhythmic, anterior only,

14:39.421 --> 14:42.489
stable frequency... <i>ay!... </i> and intensity.

14:42.491 --> 14:44.525
Okay, listen, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna help you onto the bed.

14:46.095 --> 14:49.330
That's it. Easy.

14:49.332 --> 14:51.766
Right here.

14:53.537 --> 14:55.905
Good.

14:58.743 --> 15:00.777
I think they're subsiding now.

15:00.779 --> 15:02.111
Yeah, with Braxton hicks,

15:02.113 --> 15:04.580
sometimes just changing
positions can be enough to help.

15:04.582 --> 15:07.550
A welcome little trick, Dr. Lawson.

15:07.552 --> 15:08.784
And for my next trick,

15:08.786 --> 15:12.221
I'll be performing a full exam,
just to be safe.

15:12.223 --> 15:14.622
Did you determine the gender yet?

15:14.624 --> 15:16.724
I wanted to find out,

15:16.726 --> 15:20.761
but I would be obligated
to share the results with Boris.

15:20.763 --> 15:22.330
Right. And if it's a boy,

15:22.332 --> 15:25.667
which would increase its odds
of inheriting the disease,

15:25.669 --> 15:27.468
you think it'll be even harder for Boris

15:27.470 --> 15:28.870
to embrace his own child.

15:28.872 --> 15:32.774
The most important thing to me

15:32.776 --> 15:35.143
is that this baby
is loved unconditionally.

15:35.145 --> 15:37.846
And while I don't want to raise

15:37.848 --> 15:40.348
our baby alone...

15:40.350 --> 15:43.184
I'm prepared to do just that.

15:43.186 --> 15:45.353
It's entirely up to Boris.

15:52.594 --> 15:55.662
Good thing I got your card
before I drove away.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.330
So you guys are local heroes now.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.498
Just local.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.400
Try not to scratch, Ms. Windland.

16:00.402 --> 16:01.667
Please call me Judy.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.338
Let me see your eyes for a sec.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.008
Conjunctiva injected.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.144
Where have you been?

16:10.146 --> 16:11.946
Here, since you saw me.

16:11.948 --> 16:14.583
First the traffic... it's getting
worse and worse every year.

16:14.585 --> 16:16.685
And then the accident, and now this.

16:16.687 --> 16:19.454
Uh, open, please.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.089
Pharynx is red with minimal swelling.

16:21.091 --> 16:22.624
Uvula is mid-line.

16:22.626 --> 16:24.326
Any idea what set off your allergies?

16:24.328 --> 16:27.095
Uh, well, the area rug is wool.

16:27.097 --> 16:29.430
Um, there has clearly been a cat here,

16:29.432 --> 16:31.999
and, oh, that postmodern monstrosity...

16:32.001 --> 16:33.600
that's just wrong.

16:33.602 --> 16:35.535
Sir, could you just move it,

16:35.537 --> 16:38.337
please, a bit closer to the front door?

16:40.307 --> 16:41.507
Keep going.

16:41.509 --> 16:43.276
If I move it any closer
to the front door,

16:43.278 --> 16:44.544
it's gonna be outside.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.179
Oh, you want it outside, okay.

16:46.181 --> 16:47.514
Could have just said that.

16:47.516 --> 16:49.283
Deep breath.

16:51.453 --> 16:53.154
Judy, isn't this your house?

16:53.156 --> 16:55.256
- Uh, lungs are clear.
- It used to be.

16:55.258 --> 16:57.091
My husband and I divorced a year ago.

16:57.093 --> 16:59.226
And so I... I get it during the summer.

16:59.228 --> 17:02.030
The rest of the time,
my ex is here with her.

17:02.032 --> 17:04.165
I'm an interior designer,

17:04.167 --> 17:06.001
and I can tell you that the only thing

17:06.002 --> 17:07.836
she has good taste in
is other women's husbands.

17:07.838 --> 17:09.672
The rash?

17:12.675 --> 17:15.145
Maculopapular, pruritic.

17:15.146 --> 17:16.579
Red, bumpy, and itchy.

17:16.582 --> 17:19.684
Bless you.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.653
I mean, look at this place.

17:21.655 --> 17:23.654
She's changed so much.

17:23.656 --> 17:25.423
And on top of my existing allergies,

17:25.425 --> 17:28.726
I seem to be allergic
to everything she has.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.962
We're throwing our...

17:30.964 --> 17:34.999
<i>I'm</i> throwing my annual summer
kickoff dinner party tonight,

17:35.001 --> 17:37.502
and I'm covered in hives,
and no medication is working,

17:37.504 --> 17:39.937
and I just... please tell me

17:39.939 --> 17:41.839
that my day's not gonna get any worse.

17:41.841 --> 17:43.507
Have you, uh, ever been diagnosed

17:43.509 --> 17:46.243
with diabetes or peptic ulcer disease?

17:46.245 --> 17:49.480
No.

17:49.482 --> 17:51.415
Will you, uh, excuse me a moment?

17:51.417 --> 17:52.783
Mm-hmm.

17:52.785 --> 17:54.485
Judy, I'm gonna inject you with a steroid

17:54.487 --> 17:56.086
and a couple of histamine blockers.

17:56.088 --> 17:58.088
Your day should start to get
better within a few hours,

17:58.090 --> 18:00.591
and I'll stop by later to make sure.

18:00.593 --> 18:03.326
Okay, here we go.

18:06.298 --> 18:08.866
Who was that?

18:08.868 --> 18:10.934
Okay, you don't have to tell me, I guess.

18:10.936 --> 18:12.870
Was it Raj?

18:12.872 --> 18:15.139
What? I kind of miss that guy.
It's weird.

18:15.141 --> 18:19.076
Again, Evan, I have not spoken
with Raj since our quarantine.

18:19.078 --> 18:21.078
He didn't talk to me then,

18:21.080 --> 18:23.247
and we were locked in
the same room for a whole week.

18:23.249 --> 18:25.483
Wow. Sounds like a fun quarantine.

18:25.485 --> 18:26.951
He may never speak to me again.

18:26.953 --> 18:29.220
And, honestly, he has every right not to.

18:29.222 --> 18:30.688
Look, maybe he just needs some time

18:30.690 --> 18:33.157
to get past it, you know,
like your parents do.

18:33.159 --> 18:36.227
Well, it seems he needs
more time than my parents did.

18:36.229 --> 18:38.129
That was your parents calling?

18:38.131 --> 18:39.430
They just arrived for the summer,

18:39.432 --> 18:42.067
and they want to sit down
and talk face-to-face.

18:42.069 --> 18:43.401
- That's great, Divya.
- That's awesome.

18:43.403 --> 18:44.569
I'm so happy for you.

18:44.571 --> 18:46.838
Let's call Raj while we're hot.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.040
No.

18:54.777 --> 18:57.245
- Making dinner for Paige?
- It's the way to go.

18:57.247 --> 18:58.947
It's a way more intimate reunion.

18:58.949 --> 19:00.648
Totally. Nicely played, Ev.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.116
Yeah.

19:02.118 --> 19:04.551
Well, actually, Newberg suggested it.

19:04.553 --> 19:06.420
Suggested or insisted?

19:06.422 --> 19:08.521
Uh, insisted, yeah.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.123
So...

19:10.125 --> 19:12.058
Oh, have you talked
to Jill yet, by the way?

19:12.060 --> 19:13.793
No, haven't had the chance.

19:13.795 --> 19:16.229
It's cool. Probably shouldn't force it.

19:16.231 --> 19:17.998
Huh? What... what does that mean?

19:18.000 --> 19:21.469
Nothing. It's just...

19:21.471 --> 19:24.372
Like, when she said, "we got to talk",

19:24.374 --> 19:26.942
- like, the way she said that...
- Yeah?

19:26.944 --> 19:29.144
What if her big news is bad news?

19:29.146 --> 19:30.479
Come on.

19:30.481 --> 19:32.614
Seriously. What if it's big, bad news?

19:32.616 --> 19:34.415
We'll see what happens.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.818
- Finished, boys.
- Hey.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.086
What's, uh... what's all this?

19:39.088 --> 19:40.287
Blue point oysters,

19:40.289 --> 19:42.956
lobster caviar, truffles, and champagne...

19:42.958 --> 19:44.924
foods that puts you in the mood.

19:44.926 --> 19:46.559
Yeah, in the mood to be poor.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.961
Don't be so shortsighted.

19:48.963 --> 19:51.964
It's better to live
in poverty and in love

19:51.966 --> 19:55.702
then to have a fortune and spend
it all on divorce attorneys.

19:55.704 --> 19:58.205
I forgot the vanilla saffron.

19:58.207 --> 20:01.508
We really need to find
a new place to live.

20:29.001 --> 20:31.301
Welcome back home!

20:33.071 --> 20:35.972
They're exquisite. Thank you.

20:40.077 --> 20:41.344
Father.

20:41.346 --> 20:43.480
Hello, Divya.

20:45.783 --> 20:48.852
I'm so happy that you are back.

20:48.854 --> 20:51.688
The house has been so empty
without you two.

20:51.690 --> 20:54.290
Divya, there's much to discuss.

20:55.893 --> 20:58.161
I owe you an apology

20:58.163 --> 21:00.964
for waiting until the last minute

21:00.966 --> 21:04.001
to cancel the wedding,

21:04.003 --> 21:07.638
for costing you
a lot of money by doing so,

21:07.640 --> 21:12.109
and for the embarrassment
that I caused our family.

21:12.111 --> 21:14.745
I feel awful,

21:14.747 --> 21:19.017
and I'm eager to somehow
earn your forgiveness.

21:22.555 --> 21:25.023
Mistakes were made on both sides.

21:25.025 --> 21:26.457
We should have known better

21:26.459 --> 21:28.526
than to commit you to such a close friend.

21:28.528 --> 21:32.431
Raj is a good man,
an understandable choice.

21:32.433 --> 21:36.668
He will make another woman
very, very happy.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.303
Raj is in the past.

21:38.305 --> 21:41.940
It's time to move forward as a family.

21:41.942 --> 21:44.843
You'll join us tonight for dinner...

21:44.845 --> 21:46.512
at the club, 7:00 sharp?

21:48.815 --> 21:51.784
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Good.

22:06.068 --> 22:08.203
No, Coral, I totally get it.

22:08.205 --> 22:11.107
Don't even worry about it.
Maybe next year.

22:11.109 --> 22:13.242
Send Chris my love.

22:13.244 --> 22:17.713
Sue, we're down to 15.

22:17.715 --> 22:22.618
My body has stopped revolting
against me, thanks to you.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.921
Good. The, uh, itching and runny nose?

22:25.923 --> 22:27.757
Gone and gone.

22:27.759 --> 22:30.559
- Stick out your tongue.
- Ahh.

22:30.561 --> 22:33.161
Okay, good.

22:33.163 --> 22:37.032
Okay, um, take a few deep breaths.

22:38.701 --> 22:40.468
Okay.

22:41.737 --> 22:43.037
Crystal clear.

22:43.039 --> 22:44.906
Let's see the rash.

22:44.908 --> 22:47.175
Have you ever been married, Hank?

22:47.177 --> 22:49.477
Uh, almost, once.

22:49.479 --> 22:51.513
Well, take your time. Choose wisely.

22:51.515 --> 22:53.549
Uh, that's where the "almost" came in.

22:53.551 --> 22:55.151
Oh.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.255
Huh.

22:59.257 --> 23:01.758
This one's still red and swollen.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.160
It doesn't itch.

23:03.162 --> 23:05.262
I probably bumped it moving
all the furniture around.

23:05.264 --> 23:07.498
Yeah, I... I don't see any bruising.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.433
Does this hurt?

23:09.435 --> 23:10.801
No, it feels good.

23:10.803 --> 23:13.204
When you're done,
could you do my feet?

23:13.206 --> 23:15.706
I should to get back
to setting up the party, anyway.

23:15.708 --> 23:18.442
Look, Judy, I know you care
about this party...

23:18.444 --> 23:19.843
No, Hank, what I care about

23:19.845 --> 23:23.513
is just getting things back to normal.

23:23.515 --> 23:27.050
What if my friends keep canceling?

23:27.052 --> 23:28.852
And you're thinking they will.

23:28.854 --> 23:31.120
No, I'm thinking you're having
an asymmetrical reaction

23:31.122 --> 23:33.323
to the cortisone, which I find curious.

23:33.325 --> 23:34.825
Don't I read your mind well.

23:34.827 --> 23:37.428
Uh, thank you for the concern,
but I'm okay.

23:37.430 --> 23:39.096
Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow
to follow up.

23:39.098 --> 23:40.532
I look forward to it.

23:40.534 --> 23:43.802
- And, Judy...
- Hmm?

23:43.804 --> 23:46.972
Good luck tonight.

23:46.974 --> 23:49.843
Thank you.

24:01.221 --> 24:03.822
Judy...

24:03.824 --> 24:05.423
you said you sat in traffic.

24:05.425 --> 24:07.592
On the way out here? Yeah, a ton.

24:07.594 --> 24:10.361
- For how long?
- Five hours, at least...

24:10.363 --> 24:11.929
long enough for my phone to die. Why?

24:11.931 --> 24:13.698
Do you have pain in your left leg?

24:13.700 --> 24:15.001
Hank, I can't worry about this...

24:15.003 --> 24:16.204
Judy!

24:18.506 --> 24:19.905
It...

24:19.907 --> 24:23.376
it may be a little painful.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.078
No.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.714
No.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.616
Aha, there it is.

24:29.618 --> 24:31.718
- Hmm?
- Deep-vein thrombosis.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.353
Deep-vein what?

24:33.355 --> 24:34.755
It's a clot that can form

24:34.757 --> 24:36.857
when you're sitting still for too long.

24:36.859 --> 24:39.192
- Like in traffic.
- Yep, or on a plane.

24:39.194 --> 24:41.528
It also goes by the name
of economy class syndrome.

24:41.530 --> 24:44.397
That and they charge for baggage?

24:44.399 --> 24:46.833
If the clot grows
into your thigh and breaks off,

24:46.835 --> 24:48.734
it can cause an obstruction
in your lungs.

24:48.736 --> 24:49.935
Oh.

24:49.937 --> 24:51.503
Luckily the clot's below your knee,

24:51.505 --> 24:53.138
so you have two treatment options.

24:53.140 --> 24:55.273
I can treat it here,
by pill and injection,

24:55.275 --> 24:56.375
to keep it from growing.

24:56.377 --> 24:57.943
- Or?
- Or we can hospitalize you

24:57.945 --> 24:59.612
and start the meds intravenously.

24:59.614 --> 25:01.146
Mm.

25:01.148 --> 25:03.482
Stay here, go to the hospital.

25:03.484 --> 25:06.085
Stay here, go to the hospital...

25:06.087 --> 25:08.154
Please just do your thing,

25:08.156 --> 25:09.588
so I can get back to prepping my party.

25:09.590 --> 25:11.323
Uh, Judy, with either treatment,

25:11.325 --> 25:13.158
you can't get out of bed.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.660
Oh.

25:14.662 --> 25:17.462
Okay, uh, then do your thing.

25:17.464 --> 25:20.065
I will go get in bed,

25:20.067 --> 25:23.369
and you can check on me in the morning.

25:23.371 --> 25:25.004
Good thing you're a bad liar.

25:25.006 --> 25:27.173
And now that I can't trust you,

25:27.175 --> 25:28.641
you have two new treatment options.

25:28.643 --> 25:30.910
You can cancel the party
and come to the hospital,

25:30.912 --> 25:32.444
or I can stand outside your door

25:32.446 --> 25:35.848
and send away all your guests
by citing a medical emergency.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.787
Fine.

25:41.789 --> 25:44.123
- Take me to the hospital.
- Okay.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.425
At least they allow guests.

25:46.427 --> 25:48.627
You know, you're really
killing me here, Hank.

25:48.629 --> 25:50.663
Quite the contrary.

25:57.153 --> 25:59.120
This way.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.634
What's going on here?

26:13.636 --> 26:15.369
What do you mean, Divya?

26:15.371 --> 26:17.904
I mean, what is this?

26:17.906 --> 26:22.375
This is dinner with the Uppals.

26:22.377 --> 26:24.411
Are you really trying this again?

26:24.413 --> 26:28.982
Divya, this is neither
the time nor the place.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.252
Finally...

26:32.254 --> 26:34.621
we agree on something.

26:34.623 --> 26:36.856
Divya!

26:40.561 --> 26:42.295
Ooh, smells good.

26:42.297 --> 26:44.097
What is it?

26:44.099 --> 26:47.568
It is a medley of potent aphrodisiacs.

26:47.570 --> 26:51.071
Oh. Well, I hate to disrupt
a romantic dinner.

26:51.073 --> 26:52.440
No, no, you're not disrupting.

26:52.442 --> 26:54.509
Paige postponed her return... again.

26:54.511 --> 26:56.979
Oh. That's a bummer, Evan. I'm sorry.

26:56.981 --> 26:58.280
Yeah, me too.

26:58.282 --> 27:00.048
She no-showed two days in a row.

27:00.050 --> 27:01.549
What does that mean?

27:01.551 --> 27:03.852
Like, did I do something?

27:03.854 --> 27:06.321
Did I not do something?

27:06.323 --> 27:08.557
Or did she meet someone?

27:08.559 --> 27:09.625
Evan!

27:09.627 --> 27:12.595
Okay, what did she say exactly?

27:12.597 --> 27:16.231
Well, she didn't say anything,
'cause we've just been texting.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.967
So, how did she sign her texts...

27:18.969 --> 27:21.769
uh, "love you", "xoxo"?

27:21.771 --> 27:24.272
Yeah.

27:24.274 --> 27:25.841
Some people are just to the point.

27:25.843 --> 27:27.309
You know what?

27:27.311 --> 27:29.811
She may not be the master
of romantic communication.

27:29.813 --> 27:31.813
That's okay. I happen to be.

27:31.815 --> 27:33.249
Yeah.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.718
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go write her an email

27:35.720 --> 27:38.922
that she will never delete.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.190
All right.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.594
- Poor guy.
- I know.

27:44.596 --> 27:48.197
So...

27:48.199 --> 27:49.532
So...

27:49.534 --> 27:50.600
Listen, Hank,

27:50.602 --> 27:53.802
I was away for a long time.

27:53.804 --> 27:57.039
I was recruiting and training volunteers

27:57.041 --> 27:59.942
and vaccinating entire villages.

27:59.944 --> 28:02.611
I... I saw a lot.

28:02.613 --> 28:03.913
And I...

28:05.115 --> 28:07.116
thought a lot.

28:09.119 --> 28:12.855
I finally realized what I want right now.

28:14.591 --> 28:17.961
And it's not here.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.402
When are you going back to Uruguay?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.839
I am going to tell
the hospital tomorrow

28:27.841 --> 28:30.542
and help them find
and train a replacement.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.914
I'm happy for you.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.418
Yeah, I mean, you... you...
you threw yourself

28:40.420 --> 28:43.288
into a totally new environment,
and you thrived.

28:43.290 --> 28:47.492
Well, it wasn't
quite that easy, actually.

28:47.494 --> 28:49.160
I...

28:49.162 --> 28:53.331
yeah, I had a really hard time at first.

28:53.333 --> 28:57.435
Listen, Hank, I've lived here
my whole life,

28:57.437 --> 28:59.538
but...

28:59.540 --> 29:02.508
I have to do this.

29:02.510 --> 29:06.278
You couldn't have just said
all that on the postcard?

29:10.417 --> 29:12.952
I missed you, Hank.

29:15.289 --> 29:17.456
I did.

29:49.256 --> 29:51.157
Yeah?

29:59.736 --> 30:01.202
Hi?

30:01.204 --> 30:02.937
Hi.

30:02.939 --> 30:04.772
You checked yourself out of the hospital

30:04.774 --> 30:07.909
against medical advice
after I checked you in?

30:07.911 --> 30:09.110
It was stupid. I know.

30:09.112 --> 30:12.547
But I just needed to be here, Hank.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.549
I was gonna check myself
right back in afterwards.

30:14.551 --> 30:16.618
Judy, it's a hospital, not a timeshare.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.887
- You need to be in bed.
- Why?

30:18.889 --> 30:21.857
Aside from a sore leg,
I feel totally fine...

30:21.859 --> 30:24.093
Physically anyway.

30:32.036 --> 30:34.805
Your friends didn't show?

30:34.807 --> 30:36.006
No, they showed.

30:36.008 --> 30:38.309
- They just left, in fact.
- Oh.

30:38.311 --> 30:39.811
They liked the food,

30:39.813 --> 30:43.180
and they laughed at each other's
jokes, but it just...

30:43.182 --> 30:44.415
it wasn't the same.

30:44.417 --> 30:46.450
All I know is the whole thing

30:46.452 --> 30:49.419
was way more painful
than this clot in my leg.

30:49.421 --> 30:50.586
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:50.588 --> 30:52.455
Oh, I don't want anybody's pity.

30:52.457 --> 30:56.325
I just want to move forward.

30:56.327 --> 30:57.993
He's happy, Hank.

30:57.995 --> 30:59.394
But me?

30:59.396 --> 31:01.330
I have to come out here all by myself

31:01.332 --> 31:03.599
and start my life over from scratch.

31:03.601 --> 31:06.001
It's just...

31:06.003 --> 31:08.604
Judy?

31:26.723 --> 31:28.891
Hi. This is Dr. Lawson.

31:28.893 --> 31:31.060
I'm at 40 Sluchan Avenue
with a 32-year-old female...

31:31.062 --> 31:33.362
syncopal, cyanotic, and unresponsive.

31:33.364 --> 31:35.398
Please hurry.

31:49.681 --> 31:51.783
Hi.

31:51.785 --> 31:52.951
Hi.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.853
What happened?

31:54.855 --> 31:56.421
It's okay. It's okay. You passed out,

31:56.423 --> 31:59.058
probably as a result
of a pulmonary embolism.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.127
So you weren't bluffing.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.996
I'm not much of a gambler when
it comes to arterial blockage.

32:03.998 --> 32:06.366
Blockage?

32:06.368 --> 32:07.834
Am I gonna die?

32:07.836 --> 32:09.769
No, you are not gonna die.

32:09.771 --> 32:12.105
Your vitals look good,
and I'm right here with you.

32:12.107 --> 32:15.542
- Are you having chest pain?
- Just a little bit, yeah.

32:15.544 --> 32:18.545
- Okay, how's your breathing?
- It's fine.

32:18.547 --> 32:20.781
Am I really okay,

32:20.783 --> 32:23.918
or do you just have
an amazing floor-side manner?

32:23.920 --> 32:26.753
You are really okay.

32:26.755 --> 32:28.655
I'm gonna give you
some heparin for the clot,

32:28.657 --> 32:32.091
and then we're gonna get
you back to Hamptons Heritage,

32:32.093 --> 32:34.861
where I expect a full recovery.

32:45.373 --> 32:48.141
I regret the way that
I handled things last night.

32:48.143 --> 32:52.745
I have placed a call to the Uppals

32:52.747 --> 32:55.282
to apologize for my abrupt

32:55.284 --> 32:58.085
and impolite exit.

33:00.889 --> 33:03.291
But you need to understand

33:03.293 --> 33:07.294
that Raj was not the problem.

33:11.266 --> 33:14.101
I want to choose my husband...

33:14.103 --> 33:15.635
not be assigned one, so...

33:15.637 --> 33:18.471
Now, here's what
you need to understand.

33:18.473 --> 33:21.807
Marriages in our family
have always been arranged.

33:21.809 --> 33:23.409
Your mother's marriage to me

33:23.411 --> 33:25.377
was arranged by your grandparents,

33:25.379 --> 33:28.814
by the collective wisdom of
four elders from two families,

33:28.816 --> 33:30.749
just as their marriages had been.

33:30.751 --> 33:31.983
I understand that.

33:31.985 --> 33:35.286
I understand that, and I respect that,

33:35.288 --> 33:38.656
which is why this has been
so hard for so long.

33:38.658 --> 33:43.395
You both mean the world to me.

33:46.232 --> 33:49.902
And when I find my husband,

33:49.904 --> 33:53.540
I pray that you will like him.

33:54.875 --> 33:58.645
But I will love him.

33:58.647 --> 34:01.715
Nothing takes priority over that.

34:04.052 --> 34:06.587
Well, Divya...

34:06.589 --> 34:10.625
if you can't accept our wishes,
our traditions,

34:10.627 --> 34:13.661
then you shouldn't accept
anything from us.

34:21.971 --> 34:25.741
Okay, what does that mean exactly?

34:29.545 --> 34:31.411
Hi, Judy.

34:31.414 --> 34:33.179
Well, well, well,

34:33.181 --> 34:35.882
I just love what you've done
with the place.

34:35.885 --> 34:37.251
You would love it more

34:37.253 --> 34:39.119
if they'd let me wallpaper
and change out all the fixtures.

34:40.956 --> 34:42.889
So when can I leave?

34:42.891 --> 34:46.059
Your C.T. confirmed
a small pulmonary embolism.

34:46.061 --> 34:47.893
But after the warfarin stabilizes you,

34:47.896 --> 34:50.730
we can stop the heparin
and get you out of here.

34:50.732 --> 34:51.797
And that's it?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.565
We'll monitor your platelet function,

34:53.568 --> 34:56.335
but other than that and a ban
on contact sports, yeah.

34:56.337 --> 34:57.736
More flowers.

34:57.738 --> 35:00.105
Are you going
for the hospital record here?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.576
They're from my friends.

35:03.578 --> 35:05.578
Sent out of obligation and pity.

35:05.580 --> 35:07.914
Maybe I underestimated them.

35:07.916 --> 35:09.916
And maybe they
just need to get used to you

35:09.918 --> 35:13.119
in your new environment,
just like you do.

35:13.121 --> 35:15.822
- You make it sound so easy.
- No.

35:15.824 --> 35:18.024
No, I know how hard it is, believe me.

35:18.026 --> 35:21.527
Your "almost"?

35:21.529 --> 35:24.363
She left you?

35:24.365 --> 35:26.131
Did you tell her you were a doctor?

35:28.035 --> 35:31.036
And I was where you are now...
in a world of hurt,

35:31.038 --> 35:33.638
no idea what my next step was.

35:33.640 --> 35:37.240
Then I came out here,
started my life from scratch.

35:37.242 --> 35:40.310
Now I'm happier than I've ever been...

35:40.312 --> 35:42.278
only I never got flowers.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.548
Oh, well, lucky for you,

35:45.550 --> 35:47.282
I have plenty.

35:47.284 --> 35:50.185
Thank you.

35:50.187 --> 35:52.454
Dr. Lawson.

35:52.456 --> 35:54.056
Dr. Redliner. Hi.

35:54.058 --> 35:55.991
And I thought you made
a name for yourself

35:55.993 --> 35:57.325
around here last summer.

35:57.327 --> 35:59.528
Oh. You're referring to the Jitney.

35:59.530 --> 36:01.363
And to your future, Hank.

36:01.365 --> 36:04.099
I'm sure saving a bus full
of people can't compare

36:04.101 --> 36:07.168
to the adrenaline rush of curing
a media mogul's hangover.

36:07.170 --> 36:09.637
Okay, okay, easy.

36:09.639 --> 36:12.707
Just know that the E.R. door
here is always open to you.

36:12.709 --> 36:16.477
Thank you. Thanks for the offer.

36:22.584 --> 36:24.184
Yeah, we're actually...

36:24.186 --> 36:26.253
Uh, okay, you're going right there.

36:26.255 --> 36:27.622
Uh, maybe we should go...

36:27.624 --> 36:29.390
- Yeah! Great!
- to another...

36:29.392 --> 36:31.860
Oh, excuse me.

36:31.862 --> 36:33.328
Dude, we really got to find

36:33.330 --> 36:35.331
yet another free mansion to live in.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.900
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

36:37.902 --> 36:39.535
'Cause I guess you won't be moving in

36:39.537 --> 36:40.803
with Jill anytime soon.

36:40.805 --> 36:43.706
Not sure that's in the cards, no.

36:43.708 --> 36:45.341
I'm glad you handled
her news so well, though.

36:45.343 --> 36:46.743
Yeah.

36:50.580 --> 36:51.981
If it makes you feel any better,

36:51.983 --> 36:54.550
I have a feeling
we'll be single together.

36:54.552 --> 36:58.220
Actually, that might take
all the fun out of it for me.

36:58.222 --> 37:00.956
What... no reply to your epic email?

37:00.958 --> 37:03.558
She's getting bored.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.327
Ev, come on!

37:05.329 --> 37:06.795
You're jumping to conclusions.

37:06.797 --> 37:08.564
Fairly obvious ones.

37:08.566 --> 37:10.566
Our time apart just made her realize

37:10.568 --> 37:12.869
I'm not in her league...
that's all. I'm not.

37:12.871 --> 37:16.340
Ev, this all in your head.
You and Paige are fine.

37:16.342 --> 37:18.308
In fact, you're more than fine.

37:18.310 --> 37:21.278
You're adorably and disgustingly perfect.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.946
See?

37:22.948 --> 37:25.915
I'm sure that's her
right now at the door.

37:25.917 --> 37:28.151
What are you doing?

37:28.153 --> 37:30.620
I don't want to seem desperate.

37:30.622 --> 37:31.888
- All right.
- Yeah.

37:31.890 --> 37:33.990
We're still in seventh grade. Okay.

37:33.992 --> 37:35.692
All right.

37:40.364 --> 37:42.398
Is it her? Can you see her?

37:42.400 --> 37:44.267
Hank?

37:44.269 --> 37:45.502
Paige?

37:45.504 --> 37:48.338
Anybody?

37:48.340 --> 37:50.640
I owe you an apology.

37:50.642 --> 37:53.310
Oh? For what...

37:53.312 --> 37:56.179
trying to exile my father,

37:56.181 --> 37:57.447
trying to violate

37:57.449 --> 38:00.016
my doctor-patient
confidentiality with Marisa,

38:00.018 --> 38:02.218
evicting Evan and me without notice?

38:02.220 --> 38:03.453
All of the above.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.655
That is the correct answer.

38:08.792 --> 38:11.226
Hank, I don't want Marisa to be alone

38:11.228 --> 38:13.729
for the rest of her pregnancy.

38:13.731 --> 38:17.732
She'll move back,
but only under one condition.

38:17.734 --> 38:20.835
She'd like you back at Shadow Pond.

38:20.837 --> 38:22.170
And she's right.

38:22.172 --> 38:25.674
My emotions got the best of me this time.

38:25.676 --> 38:27.677
I crossed the line.

38:29.546 --> 38:32.816
I'd like you back at Shadow Pond.

38:36.554 --> 38:38.822
I'm not a yo-yo, Boris.

38:38.824 --> 38:42.693
And you'll have a lease to prove it.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.161
A lease?

38:44.163 --> 38:46.797
You may fill in
the expiration date as you will.

38:48.433 --> 38:50.367
And I wanna pay.

38:50.369 --> 38:54.137
No more free rent...
it comes at too high a price.

38:54.139 --> 38:55.906
Shall we say market rate, then?

38:55.908 --> 38:57.741
Oh, let's not get carried away.

38:57.743 --> 38:59.509
Hank!

38:59.511 --> 39:00.743
It's getting chilly!

39:00.745 --> 39:04.046
You want I should bring you a sweater?

39:04.048 --> 39:07.316
Perhaps I underestimated
my leverage here.

39:07.318 --> 39:08.584
I'll pay anything.

39:17.259 --> 39:18.526
All right, great.

39:18.528 --> 39:20.062
Divya, you got to be more careful

39:20.064 --> 39:21.797
with those pictures of me, all right?

39:21.799 --> 39:24.133
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- Great.

39:24.135 --> 39:25.701
Ugh, we should've hired pros, man.

39:25.703 --> 39:27.269
It's the first weekend of the summer.

39:27.271 --> 39:28.470
The pros were booked.

39:28.472 --> 39:30.873
Okay, where do you want this stuff?

39:30.875 --> 39:32.942
Uh, don't put it directly in the sunlight.

39:32.944 --> 39:35.344
Got bubble wrap,

39:35.346 --> 39:36.612
got the tape.

39:36.614 --> 39:38.113
Oh, not too close to the fridge either.

39:38.115 --> 39:40.416
Sorry, Divs, it's just
really delicate, okay?

39:40.418 --> 39:41.984
Oh.

39:41.986 --> 39:44.520
Are you crazy?

39:44.522 --> 39:47.823
Why would you do that? That's not cool.

39:47.825 --> 39:50.726
I took those pictures of myself.
You know how...

39:50.728 --> 39:54.397
Oh, I know a good idea when I see one.

39:54.399 --> 39:55.698
Let's do this.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.032
- Great.
- Yes!

39:57.034 --> 39:58.501
Love it.

39:58.503 --> 39:59.902
- All right.
- Yes.

39:59.904 --> 40:01.704
You're paying for the dry cleaning.

40:01.706 --> 40:03.005
Paige?

40:09.045 --> 40:10.579
It's nice to see you back home.

40:10.581 --> 40:12.814
Hi.

40:14.817 --> 40:16.085
Evan?

40:16.087 --> 40:17.319
Yeah?

40:17.321 --> 40:18.888
Where do you want this?

40:18.890 --> 40:20.989
Oh, yeah.

40:24.261 --> 40:26.161
Cool. Thanks.

40:28.165 --> 40:29.998
Look, I'm sorry I was so M.I.A.,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.401
I was dealing with some family drama.

40:32.403 --> 40:33.869
Yeah, you mentioned that.

40:33.871 --> 40:36.104
And then I got your email,

40:36.106 --> 40:39.574
and I knew I could only respond in person.

40:39.576 --> 40:42.043
What's your response?

40:55.691 --> 40:57.457
Well, you make a very persuasive case

40:57.459 --> 40:58.926
for yourself, Ms. Collins.

40:58.928 --> 41:01.595
- Let me think it over, though.
- Okay.

41:01.597 --> 41:03.798
Well, I'm gonna go
to the car and grab the box

41:03.800 --> 41:05.600
labeled "Evan's hair product".

41:05.602 --> 41:07.369
I should probably
help you with that one.

41:07.371 --> 41:08.771
- Okay.
- It's pretty heavy.

41:13.110 --> 41:15.978
I really missed you.

41:24.388 --> 41:26.655
Okay, how about we take a quick break?

41:26.657 --> 41:29.258
That sounds great.

41:30.828 --> 41:34.363
Thank you, Boris!

41:35.999 --> 41:38.700
Oh, man, I have been getting
inundated today.

41:38.702 --> 41:39.902
Yeah. Me too.

41:39.904 --> 41:41.836
Is it a beginning-of-summer thing?

41:41.838 --> 41:44.439
"Heard about you guys and the Jitney".

41:44.441 --> 41:46.642
"Have rash, will pay".

41:46.644 --> 41:49.212
Teenager, definitely.

41:49.214 --> 41:52.015
Oh, hey, how'd it go with your parents?

41:52.017 --> 41:53.417
It went perfectly.

41:53.419 --> 41:54.685
Great.

41:54.687 --> 41:56.887
I'm so glad to hear that.

41:56.959 --> 42:02.159
Oh. By the way... any chance
I could crash here tonight?

42:02.184 --> 42:04.684
- Uh... yeah.
- Great.

42:04.709 --> 42:05.909
Thank you.

42:05.934 --> 42:06.934
Sure.

42:06.959 --> 42:08.459
Maybe tomorrow night too?

42:09.384 --> 42:13.284
Divya? How perfectly did it go... exactly?
