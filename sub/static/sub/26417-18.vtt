WEBVTT

00:01.476 --> 00:03.991
Wow, another anniversary.

00:04.340 --> 00:06.761
Seems like we were just kids
when we got into this.

00:06.846 --> 00:08.636
No one thought
we'd make it this far.

00:08.722 --> 00:11.082
When this all started,
I was just a man with a dream

00:11.168 --> 00:12.626
walking into
a run-down strip club.

00:13.117 --> 00:15.519
And look at us now.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.347
Happy Cattleman's
Anniversary, Louis.

00:19.449 --> 00:21.488
Happy Cattleman's
Anniversary.

00:23.215 --> 00:25.098
Oh! For me?

00:25.300 --> 00:28.386
Usually you just give
a present to the restaurant.

00:29.448 --> 00:31.504
This year's different.
Open it!

00:32.582 --> 00:35.019
Who's "Roth Ira"?
It's a retirement account.

00:35.105 --> 00:36.910
I opened one in your name
and one in my name

00:36.996 --> 00:38.176
when we started
the restaurant.

00:38.261 --> 00:40.027
We've done so well
that we're now on track

00:40.113 --> 00:41.871
to retire at 55!

00:41.985 --> 00:43.535
Mm.

00:43.621 --> 00:47.066
Uh, were you thinking
we'd retire at 57?

00:48.250 --> 00:49.715
60?

00:50.348 --> 00:51.496
Never.

00:51.707 --> 00:53.504
We are never retiring.

00:54.591 --> 00:56.550
Mr. Huang,
you shouldn't have.

00:56.683 --> 00:58.675
I'm the luckiest
bear in Orlando!

00:58.776 --> 01:00.222
Ha ha ha!

01:01.414 --> 01:03.121
Is this cashmere?

01:05.643 --> 01:06.866

01:06.952 --> 01:08.602

01:23.176 --> 01:26.027
Tina told me to work on
myself and become a better man,

01:26.112 --> 01:27.831
so I got you, Journal.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.130
Will she be impressed?

01:29.215 --> 01:30.431
Evan:
My guess is yes.

01:30.603 --> 01:32.167
Journaling
will show Tina

01:32.253 --> 01:33.862
you can indulge
your introspective side.

01:33.948 --> 01:35.941
Hey! It's not cool to read
over someone's shoulder, man.

01:36.026 --> 01:37.104
I would never!

01:37.190 --> 01:38.306
You were
talking out loud.

01:38.391 --> 01:39.730
- You were, actually.
- We heard every word.

01:39.815 --> 01:43.945
When you boys turn 21,
you can read my journal.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.315
Here's a tip
from someone

01:45.401 --> 01:46.615
who's been keeping
a dream journal

01:46.700 --> 01:47.917
for the past
six years...

01:48.003 --> 01:49.953
Write with
your mouth closed.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.285
Evan,
we share a room,

01:51.370 --> 01:52.745
and I've never
seen this journal.

01:52.831 --> 01:54.623
That's because it's private.
I hid it.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.491
You can be...
a little nosy.

01:56.576 --> 02:00.046
Hey, do you ever dream about
a witch with cold hands?

02:01.771 --> 02:04.341
Um, never mind.
It's probably nothing.

02:04.753 --> 02:06.503
Off to school!

02:06.589 --> 02:07.872
Bye, Mommy.

02:08.253 --> 02:12.682
Behold... the youngest student
at Orlando State University.

02:12.768 --> 02:13.948
Prove it.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.346
Fine. Youngest-looking.
Same difference.

02:16.432 --> 02:18.331
Well, congrats!
How was your registration?

02:18.417 --> 02:20.729
Well, we took a couple runs
at my photo I.D.,

02:20.815 --> 02:23.112
but we finally
got there.

02:23.557 --> 02:25.018
The only problem is,

02:25.104 --> 02:28.322
my educational administration
classes are so expensive,

02:28.407 --> 02:30.471
I could only afford
to take one a semester.

02:30.557 --> 02:33.261
Well, I know which class
you should take next...

02:33.510 --> 02:35.096
Retirement 101.

02:35.181 --> 02:36.808
Now, I know you said
you never want to retire,

02:36.893 --> 02:38.682
but you haven't seen
Rancho Contento.

02:38.768 --> 02:40.367
They're accepting
early-bird deposits.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.729
It's a planned community
in Santa Barbara

02:42.815 --> 02:44.878
and the perfect place
for us to sunset.

02:45.658 --> 02:46.987
These people look like

02:47.073 --> 02:48.588
they're in a commercial for
stool softener.

02:48.673 --> 02:51.041
Well, exactly. They're
relaxed and unencumbered,

02:51.127 --> 02:52.924
just like we'll be
when we retire there.

02:53.096 --> 02:55.713
Every morning,
we'll walk to the pier.

02:59.325 --> 03:02.361
You'll fish, like you
used to when you were a kid.

03:02.629 --> 03:05.338
I'll read
a charming local newspaper.

03:07.393 --> 03:09.297
Then we'll go back
to our bungalow

03:09.382 --> 03:12.033
to enjoy a bottle
of homemade wine

03:12.285 --> 03:13.932
as we watch the sunset.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.182
And the best part is,
unlike now,

03:16.268 --> 03:19.119
when we're busy with the boys
and the PTA and the restaurant,

03:19.205 --> 03:20.620
we'll get to spend
all our time together.

03:20.705 --> 03:23.822
Well, that part does sound nice,
but I'm sorry, Louis.

03:24.035 --> 03:27.792
I just pictured our retirement
very differently.

03:29.652 --> 03:32.052
But that was nothing.
Exactly.

03:32.138 --> 03:34.222
Retirement makes you stupid,
Louis.

03:34.307 --> 03:35.402
You have to keep moving,

03:35.488 --> 03:37.277
or else your brain
will turn to mush.

03:37.363 --> 03:38.738
We'll retire
when we die.

03:38.878 --> 03:41.988
Our bodies make that decision
for us, not ourselves.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.981
Oh, oopsie! Oh, hey, Tina.
I didn't see you sitting there.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.237
It's no big deal.
It's just a journal.

03:55.323 --> 03:57.230
I really like to indulge
my introspective side.

03:57.316 --> 03:59.722
You know, like a guy
who's really working on himself.

03:59.815 --> 04:01.394
Your shirt's on
inside out.

04:01.488 --> 04:02.751
Uh...

04:03.174 --> 04:05.118
Uh, it's really hard
to dress your body

04:05.204 --> 04:07.378
- when you're so deep inside your mind.
- Uh-huh.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.735
Yeah, I was just journaling
about that exact thing.

04:14.549 --> 04:16.998
All I'm saying is,
I took polka for three years.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.534
I'm gonna crush "DDR."

04:18.620 --> 04:21.002
I've been practicing
my "DDR" footwork for weeks.

04:21.088 --> 04:23.167
I'm practicing my "DDR"
right now.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.244
Guys, quick question...
What the hell is "DDR"?

04:29.330 --> 04:30.947
Uh,
"Dance Dance Revolution."

04:31.033 --> 04:32.283
It's this new video game

04:32.376 --> 04:34.416
that you play with your feet
instead of your thumbs.

04:34.503 --> 04:35.784
It's at an arcade
across town,

04:35.870 --> 04:38.652
- and we were hoping you could drive us.
- Why not?

04:38.738 --> 04:41.022
I won't be hanging with
the girl of my dreams anyway.

04:41.107 --> 04:42.872
Oh, buddy.
Lay it on us.

04:42.958 --> 04:44.005
Tina didn't
like Journal?

04:44.091 --> 04:45.354
I can't
figure her out!

04:45.440 --> 04:47.221
I want to become a better man
for her, but...

04:47.307 --> 04:48.620
what does that
even mean?

04:48.706 --> 04:50.963
How can this be better?
You're the total package!

04:51.049 --> 04:53.268
You said it, not me.
Now, back to me and Tina.

04:53.364 --> 04:55.816
So, basically, I've tried
everything to get her back.

04:55.902 --> 04:56.984
So sometimes,
I'm, like,

04:57.070 --> 04:58.425
does she really want me
to be a better man

04:58.510 --> 05:00.427
or does she just like
that Pearl Jam song?

05:00.542 --> 05:02.539
I mean, it's a good song,
but I just feel like

05:02.625 --> 05:04.674
it's influenced
a whole generation of girls.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.183
Or I could
write her a sonnet,

05:06.356 --> 05:08.076
but then I'd have to learn
what a sonnet is.

05:08.169 --> 05:09.878
So, yeah,
that's where my head's at.

05:11.351 --> 05:13.370
Oh, dang.
We were just getting started.

05:13.807 --> 05:14.923
Hey.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.768
Tina's your sister.
Help me out.

05:16.893 --> 05:19.127
Just tell me
what she likes.

05:19.384 --> 05:21.846
Lately, all she can talk about
is "Sex and the City."

05:21.978 --> 05:23.264
At first,
I was worried

05:23.349 --> 05:25.057
she was following Trish
down her dark path.

05:25.143 --> 05:27.408
But turns out,
it's just a TV show.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:36.923 --> 05:38.626
Hey, Deidre.

05:38.721 --> 05:40.564
And, uh, Richard.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.861
Oh. If I knew
we were having guests over,

05:42.947 --> 05:44.486
I would've put out
the fun welcome mat.

05:44.572 --> 05:45.914
Oh,
I invited Deidre over

05:46.000 --> 05:47.817
to sell me
some of her floozy makeup.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.113
Okay.

05:50.369 --> 05:52.519
Hello, beautiful
insert-name-of-customer!

05:52.605 --> 05:53.789
I... Oh.

05:54.008 --> 05:55.157
Um...

05:55.281 --> 05:57.121
Sorry.
I'm nervous.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.996
Hello,
beautiful Jessica!

06:00.082 --> 06:01.286
Hello.

06:02.417 --> 06:05.169
Spring is all about
the shimmer.

06:05.878 --> 06:07.191
Get fudged!

06:07.832 --> 06:09.371
I forgot
my neutral nudes.

06:09.457 --> 06:10.874
It's just...

06:11.086 --> 06:12.120
One second.

06:14.699 --> 06:15.737
Okay.

06:15.823 --> 06:16.734
You hate Deidre,

06:16.820 --> 06:18.531
and you always say
"Makeup is for uglies."

06:18.617 --> 06:20.109
Why would you invite her
over here?

06:20.195 --> 06:22.488
Oh, I'm just supporting
small local businesses,

06:22.574 --> 06:24.464
like I always do.

06:24.698 --> 06:27.333
But, hey,
while I'm doing this,

06:27.442 --> 06:29.672
maybe you could
hang out with Richard.

06:30.058 --> 06:32.246
You know, he retired early. Oh.

06:32.332 --> 06:34.050
I see what you're doing,
Jessica.

06:34.136 --> 06:34.957
You want me to see

06:35.043 --> 06:36.753
that retirement
has made Richard stupid.

06:36.839 --> 06:37.691
Well, guess what.

06:37.777 --> 06:39.925
Retirement isn't stupid,
and neither is Richard.

06:40.011 --> 06:43.535
Oh, please. He married Deidre.
Case closed.

06:45.486 --> 06:46.503
Oh.

06:46.589 --> 06:47.816
Sorry.
Could you hear that?

06:47.902 --> 06:49.222
I'm listening
to an audiobook.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.827
Oh! What a productive way
to spend your retirement.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.012
Jessica and I were just starting
to think about that stuff.

06:55.097 --> 06:56.121
I'd love
to pick your brain.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.331
Or what's left of it.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.894
Well, why don't we leave
the ladies

06:58.980 --> 07:00.631
to their Mary Kay
and go to my place?

07:00.717 --> 07:01.887
I can show you
my training room.

07:01.972 --> 07:03.496
I built it myself
when I retired.

07:03.582 --> 07:05.173
Oh, you hear that,
Jessica?

07:05.259 --> 07:06.476
Since Richard
is retired,

07:06.562 --> 07:08.665
he has time
to build himself a home gym.

07:09.009 --> 07:10.072
I'd love to see it.

07:10.158 --> 07:11.548
Fire up a lat pole.

07:11.634 --> 07:12.751
Great.

07:12.837 --> 07:14.788
But, actually,
it's not a home gym.

07:14.874 --> 07:17.111
I-It's a room
for my model train.

07:17.199 --> 07:19.040
I like to watch it
go through the tunnels.

07:19.235 --> 07:21.415
Every time, I don't think
it's gonna come out,

07:21.501 --> 07:23.470
but
then it does!

07:27.729 --> 07:28.688
Mm.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.064
Thanks again for letting me
watch your HBO, Uncle Marvin.

07:31.305 --> 07:32.321
Are you kidding?

07:32.407 --> 07:33.831
I should be thanking you
for introducing me

07:33.916 --> 07:36.266
to this pun-tastic look
at the lives and loves

07:36.352 --> 07:38.251
of these crazy
"Sex and the City" gals.

07:38.337 --> 07:39.095
Yeah.

07:39.181 --> 07:41.131
Honestly, I don't know
why Tina likes this show.

07:41.232 --> 07:42.697
All they do
is eat brunch,

07:42.837 --> 07:44.820
walk to brunch, or miss a brunch.
Ah.

07:44.906 --> 07:46.150
Feels like
a lot of brunches.

07:46.236 --> 07:48.028
Well, I know
what I like about this show,

07:48.114 --> 07:50.143
and it's right there
in the title.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.180
The city.

07:52.265 --> 07:53.362
Oh, thank God.

07:53.448 --> 07:55.784
I've never seen
the Big Apple look so vibrant.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.509
The food, the cabs,

07:57.742 --> 07:59.245
the fresh possibility

07:59.331 --> 08:00.784
of a fistfight
around every corner.

08:00.870 --> 08:02.787
I can see why
these gals date so much.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.041
It'd be hard
not to fall in love in NYC.

08:12.734 --> 08:14.302
What are you doing?

08:18.387 --> 08:19.804
Hey, I thought
you were sleeping.

08:19.913 --> 08:21.659
I was acting.

08:21.853 --> 08:24.174
All right, I'm headed off
to orientation.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.953
I hope everyone came prepared,

08:26.039 --> 08:27.775
because I don't
loan out pencils.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.658
Surprise!

08:29.744 --> 08:31.547
I took the morning off
so I could drive you to school.

08:31.632 --> 08:34.361
Aww, Louis,
that is so sweet.

08:34.479 --> 08:36.296
Open my door for me
when we get there.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.969
I want everyone to think
I'm a trust-fund baby.

08:42.534 --> 08:44.402
How are they gonna think
you're a trust-fund baby

08:44.487 --> 08:46.904
if you're carrying your books
in Mom's Mervyn's bag?

08:47.095 --> 08:48.690
Bill Gates
flies coach.

08:49.131 --> 08:51.371
Louis, you missed your turn.
No, I didn't.

08:51.457 --> 08:53.062
Because today,
you're not going to school.

08:53.147 --> 08:54.487
And I'm not going
to work.

08:54.580 --> 08:57.265
- Today, we're retired.
- What?

08:57.351 --> 08:58.446
I'm gonna show you
what our lives

08:58.531 --> 09:00.406
will be like
at Rancho Contento.

09:03.937 --> 09:05.421
Are you
contento yet?

09:05.702 --> 09:08.343
It means "happy."

09:11.639 --> 09:14.429
Look at us...
Two relaxed retirees.

09:14.515 --> 09:16.225
Don't you feel... free?

09:16.311 --> 09:18.563
No. I feel like
I'm being kidnapped.

09:18.649 --> 09:21.854
Can't we pretend to be old,
lazy people another day?

09:21.986 --> 09:24.170
You got your turn to show me what
you think retirement will be like

09:24.255 --> 09:26.179
with Richard.
Now it's my turn.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.405
I spent two hours
in that train room.

09:28.594 --> 09:30.093
I can still
hear the choo-choos.

09:30.179 --> 09:32.952
Okay, fine.
Let's be retired.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.030
But if my brain turns to
mush, it's on you.

09:35.131 --> 09:36.202
Great!

09:36.678 --> 09:39.716
What is this place?
Are we at a mall?

09:40.155 --> 09:42.140
No, it's an outdoor
shopping center.

09:42.226 --> 09:43.444
But this
is just an example.

09:43.530 --> 09:46.046
The pier at Rancho Contento
will be much better.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.436
And we won't hear the screams
from the piercing kiosk.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.959
That's the only part
I like.

09:50.178 --> 09:51.765
Focus on the fishing.

09:51.851 --> 09:55.093
O, Lady Sea, will she release
her scaled bounty

09:55.179 --> 09:57.483
or drag us all
to her murky depths?

09:57.671 --> 10:00.116
That man fell asleep
with a burrito in his mouth.

10:00.515 --> 10:01.905
Well, he earned that.

10:01.991 --> 10:04.991
After a lifetime of hard work,
he's allowed a burrito nap.

10:05.077 --> 10:07.647
You know what I remember
from fishing with my uncle?

10:07.733 --> 10:11.265
He said that when a shark
stops moving, it dies.

10:11.382 --> 10:14.022
These sharks,
they're all dead.

10:14.108 --> 10:15.335
Oh, come on.

10:15.421 --> 10:17.975
They're still vibrant,
curious people with full lives.

10:18.061 --> 10:19.061
Ha!

10:20.235 --> 10:21.686
Oh.

10:21.839 --> 10:25.186
Oh, now you're too good
to wave at Old Tom, eh?

10:25.272 --> 10:26.822
Go to hell, Harriet!

10:27.386 --> 10:30.147
Oh, Rancho Contento
would've weeded that guy out.

10:32.391 --> 10:35.772
In New York City, a single guy
only needs three things...

10:36.030 --> 10:37.694
A fabulous outfit,

10:37.780 --> 10:39.788
a fabulous plan
to get his ex back,

10:39.874 --> 10:42.366
and the support
of a fabulous crew.

10:42.690 --> 10:44.038
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

10:44.124 --> 10:46.179
Love the look, Eddie,
but it's a little fancy

10:46.265 --> 10:47.447
for "Dance Dance Revolution."

10:47.561 --> 10:48.819
Yeah,
maybe you should change.

10:48.905 --> 10:50.679
About that...
Before I drive us,

10:50.765 --> 10:52.179
I need
a teeny-tiny Tina favor.

10:52.314 --> 10:54.265
After watching "Sex and
the City," I realized...

10:54.351 --> 10:55.663
Duh...
What better way

10:55.749 --> 10:57.244
to show Tina
I'm broadening my horizons

10:57.329 --> 10:58.678
than by sweeping her
off her feet

10:58.764 --> 11:01.082
and taking her to the most
romantic city in the world?

11:01.168 --> 11:03.786
Ooh, Pensacola.
Niiiiice.

11:04.025 --> 11:05.111
New York City.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.635
But since I obviously
can't afford that,

11:06.720 --> 11:07.838
I'm gonna create
a brunch date

11:07.923 --> 11:09.845
at a cool NYC restaurant
right here...

11:09.931 --> 11:11.220
With your help,
of course.

11:11.306 --> 11:12.329
Sweet idea, Eddie.

11:12.415 --> 11:14.283
You can explain what brunch is
to us in the car.

11:14.368 --> 11:15.846
Nah, this is way more important
than the arcade.

11:15.931 --> 11:17.728
I've been trying
to get Tina back for weeks.

11:17.814 --> 11:19.650
Okay, so,
I'll be the cook.

11:19.743 --> 11:21.180
Walter, you'll be the waiter.

11:21.266 --> 11:22.680
And, Trent,
you'll be the busker

11:22.807 --> 11:24.056
who plays sax for us
as we exit the restaurant.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.783
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- I know!

11:25.868 --> 11:27.450
In what universe
am I not the busker?

11:27.536 --> 11:28.993
Look at this face...
Total busker.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.212
No, he means

11:30.298 --> 11:32.032
Eddie promised
to take us to the arcade,

11:32.118 --> 11:33.377
and now he's trying
to get us to do

11:33.462 --> 11:35.017
some lame
"get Tina back scheme" instead.

11:35.102 --> 11:36.652
Hey, the scheme is not lame!

11:36.952 --> 11:39.196
Or is it?
I'm open to suggestions.

11:39.525 --> 11:41.649
It's always
about you, Eddie. Yeah.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.118
All we talk about is you and
ways for you to get Tina back.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.400
Walter: You haven't even
asked about Brian.

11:45.485 --> 11:48.070
He's got mono, Eddie...
The kissing disease.

11:48.243 --> 11:50.606
Well, I'm trying to get
the kissing disease!

11:50.865 --> 11:52.860
You guys won't even help!

11:57.909 --> 11:58.948
Ugh.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.958
All I taste is swamp.

12:01.106 --> 12:03.624
You're supposed to say
"notes of swamp."

12:03.710 --> 12:06.561
Anyway, the wine I make at
Rancho Contento will be better.

12:06.647 --> 12:07.659
Maybe.

12:07.937 --> 12:09.854
Or maybe we'll be so dumb
from being retired,

12:09.940 --> 12:12.573
we won't even know
what tastes good anymore.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.979
I didn't realize I was on stage
at the Chuckle Factory.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.304
Sorry.

12:17.389 --> 12:18.859
It's just,
we used to think

12:18.945 --> 12:20.628
the same thing
about retirement.

12:20.752 --> 12:23.420
I was sure I would
suddenly turn stupid.

12:23.630 --> 12:26.382
I thought if I stopped moving,
I would die.

12:26.498 --> 12:27.747
You two are retired?

12:27.832 --> 12:28.915
Mm-hmm.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.768
But you seem so...

12:31.035 --> 12:32.448
not dead.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.245
Active.
She means active.

12:35.229 --> 12:36.360
Oh, we are.

12:36.503 --> 12:38.315
I'm building
my own library at home.

12:38.401 --> 12:39.823
Even got a microfiche.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.800
And Kent here
plans all our trips.

12:41.893 --> 12:44.268
I was a financial advisor
for 20 years,

12:44.377 --> 12:45.526
and Linda was an attorney,

12:45.612 --> 12:47.565
so we were always too busy
to travel.

12:47.651 --> 12:49.292
But now
we get to make up

12:49.378 --> 12:51.355
for all the together time
we missed.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.010
Yeah.

12:53.758 --> 12:55.174
But now
that you don't work,

12:55.259 --> 12:56.456
do you ever get...

12:56.542 --> 12:57.729
Hopelessly bored?

12:57.815 --> 12:58.925
Honestly, no.

12:59.011 --> 13:01.526
I had my name on a law firm
for 10 years.

13:01.612 --> 13:03.370
My legacy is set.

13:03.456 --> 13:08.089
I feel like I earned this time
to do whatever I want, you know?

13:08.706 --> 13:10.346
That could be us,
Jessica...

13:10.447 --> 13:12.315
The cool retired couple
at the winery

13:12.401 --> 13:13.768
who also make
their own wines?

13:13.854 --> 13:15.581
That sounds like
a conflict of interest,

13:15.667 --> 13:17.799
but...
maybe you're right.

13:17.909 --> 13:19.666
Kent: Uh, just a tip
from someone who tried.

13:19.751 --> 13:21.901
Make limoncello
instead.

13:21.986 --> 13:24.447
Homemade wine
is fungus city.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.982
And the bathtub...

13:26.068 --> 13:28.538
Not a great
fermenting vessel.

13:34.804 --> 13:36.650
Check the pillow.

13:37.462 --> 13:39.033
Don't tell Evan
I was snooping.

13:39.148 --> 13:41.822
I don't talk to that kid
unless I have to.

13:46.637 --> 13:49.695
Monday... dreamt Emery was
eaten by a great white shark.

13:49.781 --> 13:52.064
Tuesday... dreamt Emery
fell off a cliff.

13:52.149 --> 13:53.673
Wednesday...
Dreamt Emery

13:53.759 --> 13:55.439
was attacked
by a swarm of killer bees.

13:55.525 --> 13:56.572
I woke up laughing.

13:56.658 --> 13:58.204
I die
in all these dreams?

13:58.322 --> 13:59.957
Does Evan
want to kill me?

14:01.361 --> 14:02.752
O-Oh... Oh, sorry,

14:02.843 --> 14:05.227
but it's funny
when you picture it.

14:05.313 --> 14:08.337
Beard of bees?
Funny.

14:14.548 --> 14:16.673
I like the cut
of Miranda's jib.

14:16.837 --> 14:18.783
- How 'bout you?
- Huh? Sorry.

14:18.869 --> 14:20.501
I just can't believe
my friends.

14:20.587 --> 14:22.294
I had the perfect plan
to get Tina back,

14:22.379 --> 14:24.196
and they wouldn't
help me.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.064
My crew
should support me

14:26.150 --> 14:28.267
- like Carrie's crew supports her.
- Yeah.

14:28.353 --> 14:30.158
These gals would do anything
for Carrie.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.189
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.139
You think Miranda would
leave Carrie in the lurch

14:33.224 --> 14:35.041
to go to some dumb arcade?

14:35.126 --> 14:37.244
Hell no!
Miranda's ride-or-die.

14:37.330 --> 14:39.166
Yeah. Heck, they all are,
for each other.

14:39.252 --> 14:40.447
Look, Eddie.

14:40.532 --> 14:41.781
You know, the more
I watch this show,

14:41.866 --> 14:45.142
the more I see
it's not about sex or brunch

14:45.228 --> 14:46.719
or even New York City.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.595
It's about
these four friends.

14:48.681 --> 14:51.086
I guess so.
And Manolo, whoever that is.

14:51.172 --> 14:53.226
Yeah. They're always gonna
be there for each other.

14:53.328 --> 14:55.244
Have you always been there
for your boys?

14:55.330 --> 14:57.250
That's what makes a crew
a crew.

14:57.359 --> 14:59.582
I mean, that
and dressing up as a cow

14:59.695 --> 15:01.570
to break out of a Thai prison.

15:02.531 --> 15:04.007
I couldn't help
but wonder...

15:04.093 --> 15:05.843
In trying to become
a better man for Tina,

15:05.929 --> 15:08.320
did I end up becoming
a bad friend to my boys?

15:12.617 --> 15:15.023
Well, the Cattleman's
suggestion box

15:15.109 --> 15:17.031
was full of
barbecue sauce again.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.609
I miss being retired.

15:18.695 --> 15:20.375
You know, I had fun
being retired, too.

15:20.464 --> 15:22.257
Especially meeting
Kent and Linda.

15:22.343 --> 15:23.640
They're doing it right.

15:23.745 --> 15:26.129
I knew you'd come around
on retirement!

15:26.237 --> 15:28.019
Does this mean you're open
to Rancho Contento?

15:28.104 --> 15:29.791
I think someday,
I might be.

15:29.877 --> 15:31.059
Really?

15:31.214 --> 15:32.665
You know, if we send in
our deposits now,

15:32.750 --> 15:34.134
we can still get
that early-bird deal.

15:34.219 --> 15:35.463
Shall I grab
the checkbooks?

15:35.549 --> 15:37.487
You can, but I already
spent my retirement.

15:37.573 --> 15:38.989
That money's gone.

15:39.075 --> 15:40.377
Wh...

15:41.057 --> 15:44.049
You know, this swamp wine
really grows on you.

15:48.456 --> 15:50.791
What do you mean the money's gone?
Where has it gone?

15:50.877 --> 15:52.205
To Orlando State.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.135
I used the savings
from my retirement

15:54.221 --> 15:55.538
to double my class load.

15:55.639 --> 15:58.490
So now I will graduate
in two years, not four.

15:58.576 --> 15:59.791
What?
How could you do that?

15:59.877 --> 16:02.095
If you're worried about
the early withdrawal penalties

16:02.263 --> 16:04.380
from the Roth IRA,
don't be.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.526
We're good.
I called Kent.

16:06.612 --> 16:07.628
Who?!

16:07.714 --> 16:09.744
The cool retired guy
from the winery.

16:09.830 --> 16:13.127
I also got his recipe
for limoncello.

16:13.286 --> 16:14.854
Don't touch the jars
in the pantry

16:14.940 --> 16:16.135
for six to eight months.

16:16.221 --> 16:18.237
I can't believe you'd rather
spend money on school

16:18.323 --> 16:19.354
than our retirement!

16:19.440 --> 16:20.659
I mean, school sucks!

16:20.745 --> 16:23.252
That's what the majority
of graffiti is about!

16:26.748 --> 16:27.915
'Sup, guys?

16:28.001 --> 16:29.025
Look,
this isn't easy

16:29.111 --> 16:30.370
- for me to say...
- Young man: <i>Hey!</i>

16:30.455 --> 16:31.772
No cutskis.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.307
I'm not cutting,
man.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.873
I'm just trying
to talk to my friends.

16:35.187 --> 16:37.002
I've got my eyes on you.

16:37.348 --> 16:39.945
As I was saying, I'm sorry
if I've been a bad friend.

16:40.031 --> 16:42.138
Especially when you guys have
listened to me talk about Tina

16:42.223 --> 16:43.506
basically nonstop.

16:43.592 --> 16:45.320
You ha been
kind of obsessed.

16:45.406 --> 16:47.557
I know, and I appreciate
you guys putting up with it.

16:47.643 --> 16:50.522
Y'all are like my Miranda,
my Samantha, my Charlotte,

16:50.608 --> 16:51.546
and my Carrie.

16:51.632 --> 16:53.273
And I'm lucky
to be more like

16:53.406 --> 16:55.937
- a Stanford Blatch in the crew.
- Who?

16:56.023 --> 16:58.570
Oh, he's this dope gay dude who
should be more of a major character.

16:58.655 --> 17:01.139
The point is, it can't
just be me all the time.

17:06.008 --> 17:07.910
Now, let's
"Dance Dance Revolution."

17:10.171 --> 17:13.021
I bribed him with Cattleman's ribs
to take you guys to the front.

17:13.248 --> 17:15.468
- Thanks, Eddie.
- I can finally pee!

17:15.554 --> 17:17.503
No, no, no, no, no.
You cannot cutski.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.119
No cutskis!

17:23.388 --> 17:25.436
And king me.
Again.

17:28.626 --> 17:29.742
Sorry, Grandma.

17:29.828 --> 17:31.898
It's not you
who I want to destroy.

17:32.382 --> 17:33.780
I can't take this
anymore!

17:33.866 --> 17:34.883
Why do you want
to kill me?

17:34.968 --> 17:36.274
What makes you say that,
dear brother?

17:36.359 --> 17:38.265
Because I read
your dream journal, okay?

17:38.351 --> 17:39.734
I die in all of your dreams.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.468
Aha! I knew it.

17:41.554 --> 17:43.193
But there's one thing
you didn't count on.

17:43.278 --> 17:44.679
That journal was a fake.

17:44.765 --> 17:46.538
I planted it
to teach you a lesson.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.788
Maybe now
you'll respect my privacy.

17:48.874 --> 17:51.085
So you didn't actually dream
those horrible things?

17:51.673 --> 17:53.351
You spent hours
imagining them

17:53.437 --> 17:54.904
and writing them
in a fake journal?

17:54.990 --> 17:56.116
That's worse.

17:56.202 --> 17:57.390
I didn't write it.

17:57.484 --> 17:59.210
- Grandma did.
- What?

18:10.238 --> 18:11.789
Hm.

18:11.874 --> 18:13.757
Your limoncello
is terrible.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.394
I told you
it's not ready yet.

18:18.362 --> 18:20.347
And neither am I.

18:22.105 --> 18:24.956
Louis, I would love
to retire with you one day.

18:25.042 --> 18:27.805
I just don't feel
like I've earned it yet.

18:27.891 --> 18:29.167
What do you mean?

18:29.253 --> 18:31.107
Well, talking to Linda
about her legacy

18:31.193 --> 18:34.175
made me realize
I haven't accomplished enough.

18:34.339 --> 18:35.925
What? That's crazy!

18:36.011 --> 18:38.269
You're a great parent,
you're head of the PTA,

18:38.355 --> 18:40.434
not to mention everything
you've done for Cattleman's.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.066
I know, but it's "Louis Huang's
Cattleman's Ranch"

18:43.152 --> 18:44.354
on the sign.

18:44.735 --> 18:46.659
I want my name
on something.

18:46.745 --> 18:48.776
That's why I need to
go back to school

18:48.862 --> 18:50.433
and become
the best principal

18:50.519 --> 18:52.839
so I can cement
my own legacy...

18:52.925 --> 18:55.917
Get my name on a door,
maybe a whole school.

18:56.183 --> 18:57.589
Maybe even a college.

18:57.752 --> 19:00.175
"The University of Phoenix
and Jessica Huang."

19:00.261 --> 19:02.831
Mnh, no. Not that,
but something similar.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.917
Then I can relax
and fish

19:06.034 --> 19:08.745
and get dumb with you
at Rancho Contento

19:08.870 --> 19:10.675
knowing that my name
lives on.

19:10.761 --> 19:13.175
I get it.
You want to make an impact.

19:13.701 --> 19:16.644
"College of William & Mary
& Jessica Huang."

19:16.753 --> 19:21.658
Or "Jessica Huang presents
Harvard University."

19:21.869 --> 19:23.370
Ah.

19:24.086 --> 19:25.659
That's good.

19:29.952 --> 19:31.178
Hey, Eddie.

19:31.264 --> 19:32.795
Trent told me
how you VIP'ed

19:32.881 --> 19:34.248
your friends
at the arcade.

19:34.334 --> 19:35.578
That was really cool
of you.

19:35.664 --> 19:36.914
What good is a greased rib

19:36.999 --> 19:38.772
if you can't grease
a palm or two?

19:39.398 --> 19:41.459
Um, Trent also said
you've been watching

19:41.545 --> 19:42.794
a lot of "Sex and the City."

19:42.914 --> 19:44.831
And Manolo?
That's a shoe.

19:45.073 --> 19:47.810
Oh, God.
That makes so much more sense.

19:48.797 --> 19:51.486
Want to hang out tomorrow,
talk "SATC"?

19:51.572 --> 19:52.627
I'd love to,

19:52.713 --> 19:55.674
but I got big brunch plans
with my crew.

19:55.984 --> 19:57.000
Rain check?

19:57.275 --> 19:58.754
Definitely.

20:00.088 --> 20:02.573
Journal is not
gonna believe this.

20:08.530 --> 20:09.952
Surprise.

20:10.054 --> 20:12.049
Louis, if you try
to kidnap me again,

20:12.134 --> 20:13.788
I will call
campus security.

20:13.874 --> 20:16.059
They are guaranteed to respond
within 9 to 13 minutes.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.335
I just need five.
I have a present for you.

20:18.421 --> 20:20.179
I can't let you
go back to school

20:20.265 --> 20:21.936
without a real backpack.

20:22.022 --> 20:23.772
Now, this is just a start,
but I know

20:23.858 --> 20:26.275
you'll have your name on a door
or a building in no time.

20:26.379 --> 20:28.396
Aww.
That is very sweet.

20:28.692 --> 20:29.808
Unsafe,

20:29.894 --> 20:32.077
because now potential muggers
will know my name,

20:32.163 --> 20:33.826
but it's very sweet.

20:33.912 --> 20:36.225
That's not all.
Look inside.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.874
I cashed out
my retirement account, too.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.593
Now you can go full-time.

20:42.679 --> 20:43.944
Oh!

20:44.088 --> 20:45.772
Louis, thank you!

20:45.858 --> 20:49.686
Oh, now I can join
the Orlando-Re-Mi's.

20:49.808 --> 20:51.458
It's
the a cappella group.

20:51.544 --> 20:52.928
Once I get in,
I'm changing the name

20:53.013 --> 20:55.155
to "Jessica
and the Do-Re-Mi's."

21:00.483 --> 21:01.632
Mimosa?

21:01.717 --> 21:03.296
Don't worry.
It's just OJ and Sprite.

21:03.382 --> 21:04.465
Well, hell,
why not?

21:04.551 --> 21:06.135
As Samantha would say,

21:06.221 --> 21:07.405
"I'll try anything once."

21:07.491 --> 21:10.254
So, brunch is just breakfast
at lunchtime.

21:10.339 --> 21:12.543
