07:47.000 --> 07:49.459
and climb up to the top,

07:49.501 --> 07:52.334
but seeing how massive it is

07:52.334 --> 07:54.334
and with these knees...

07:56.167 --> 07:57.334
Is there an elevator?

07:57.334 --> 07:59.959
They just broke it yesterday.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.292
I have bad knees.

08:01.334 --> 08:03.292
Ahh.

08:03.334 --> 08:04.709
I'm coming.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.459
My knees are just shaking

08:08.459 --> 08:09.751
right now,

08:09.792 --> 08:11.375
they are going numb.

08:12.834 --> 08:13.918
Just the nobles,

08:13.918 --> 08:14.959
the kings, the royalty

08:15.000 --> 08:16.584
- would have been able
- to be up here.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.501
- This is so powerful,
- you guys.

08:18.501 --> 08:20.167
- Obviously, they have
- no compassion

08:20.167 --> 08:21.334
for what I'm going through,

08:21.334 --> 08:23.709
so I'll go at my own pace.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.167
Rez, look at the carvings.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.000
- My knees are vibrating
- right now.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.459
Anyone that drinks

08:35.459 --> 08:37.334
as much as gg drinks

08:37.375 --> 08:39.626
would be laid out.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.709
F...

08:40.709 --> 08:41.876
Gg's lagging behind,

08:41.876 --> 08:43.542
not because of ra,

08:43.542 --> 08:45.334
it's because of her clubbing,

08:45.375 --> 08:46.876
her partying last night.

08:46.876 --> 08:48.250
She's not in pain,

08:48.250 --> 08:49.626
she's miserable

08:49.667 --> 08:51.042
because she's hungover.

08:55.042 --> 08:56.542
- Feel the breeze.
- Look behind you.

08:56.542 --> 08:57.834
- Beautiful.
- Oh my god.

08:57.876 --> 08:59.334
Look at the scenery.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.792
Going down is gonna freak

09:00.792 --> 09:02.209
me the f... out.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.375
- You don't have to
- look down, honey.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.501
Just look at the ground

09:04.542 --> 09:06.209
and go one step at a time.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.209
Welcome to the skies.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.417
Is that the highest?

09:13.417 --> 09:14.709
- Yes.
- Nice, nice.

09:14.751 --> 09:15.792
Oh, wow.

09:15.792 --> 09:16.834
Holy sh...

09:16.876 --> 09:18.250
- Finally, when I arrive
- to the top,

09:18.250 --> 09:19.751
you just really realize

09:19.751 --> 09:21.250
why this was built,

09:21.250 --> 09:22.334
close to the heavens

09:22.334 --> 09:23.375
and the skies.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.334
And you have to become still

09:25.375 --> 09:26.459
on the inside really

09:26.501 --> 09:27.584
to take it in

09:27.584 --> 09:29.000
and feel the people

09:29.000 --> 09:30.417
who lived here

09:30.417 --> 09:32.375
3,000 years ago.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.918
So cool.

09:34.918 --> 09:36.250
Oh, wow.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.250
That's Guatemala, yes.

09:37.292 --> 09:39.250
- That is the border
- town of Belize,

09:39.250 --> 09:41.542
we don't really have a fence.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.918
Wow.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.083
It's crazy, being here

09:48.083 --> 09:49.334
on top of this artifact,

09:49.334 --> 09:50.542
amongst the clouds,

09:50.584 --> 09:52.292
I'm looking down and thinking,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.083
- "wow, look how far
- I've come."

09:54.125 --> 09:55.584
In life, we have a journey

09:55.626 --> 09:57.584
and we never know

09:57.626 --> 09:59.584
what the end result

09:59.626 --> 10:02.083
is gonna look like.

10:02.125 --> 10:03.209
Maybe the universe

10:03.209 --> 10:04.292
has a plan for me

10:04.292 --> 10:05.751
- and I just have to follow
- this journey

10:05.792 --> 10:07.375
to see where I end up.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.792
[Music playing]

10:11.792 --> 10:13.083
- Coming up...
- It's none of your

10:13.125 --> 10:14.959
- f... ing business.
- It is my f... ing business.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.709
- I'll chime in what the f...
- Focus on your sh...

10:16.751 --> 10:18.918
Focus on your own sh...

10:27.834 --> 10:29.709
I'm coming.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.584
Ouch.

10:39.626 --> 10:41.292
Oh, that breeze.

10:43.501 --> 10:45.417
- I don't know what I was
- expecting

10:45.459 --> 10:47.792
to feel once I got up here,

10:47.834 --> 10:48.918
but it's just so amazing.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.042
My knees are just shaking

10:50.042 --> 10:51.083
right now,

10:51.125 --> 10:52.417
they're going numb,

10:52.459 --> 10:53.834
but I'm so excited

10:53.834 --> 10:55.167
that I did this,

10:55.209 --> 10:56.542
I pushed myself to get

10:56.542 --> 10:57.834
to this top

10:57.834 --> 10:59.459
because this view

10:59.501 --> 11:01.125
is something else.

11:03.501 --> 11:04.667
It's a very spiritual

11:04.667 --> 11:05.834
place to be.

11:05.876 --> 11:07.083
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.334
We have room right here.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.250
No, no, I'm good, - I'm good.

11:10.292 --> 11:11.792
No, no, no, no, no.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.250
Hello. Don't do that.

11:13.292 --> 11:14.375
I'm in control.

11:14.375 --> 11:15.542
I'm definitely

11:15.542 --> 11:16.709
petrified of heights.

11:16.751 --> 11:18.334
My vertigo is kicking in,

11:18.375 --> 11:20.167
I'm scared of falling.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.000
- You know, I may look like
- I'm a thug

11:22.042 --> 11:23.709
but I'm not gonna front,

11:23.709 --> 11:25.125
a bitch has problems.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.501
And now, I wanna get down

11:26.542 --> 11:27.959
as fast as possible.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.501
Tour guide, sir.

11:30.667 --> 11:31.876
Hello?

11:31.876 --> 11:33.250
Yeah, that's the way down,

11:33.250 --> 11:34.626
keep going.

11:34.667 --> 11:35.792
- We're heading down,
- you guys?

11:35.834 --> 11:36.959
Yes.

11:38.042 --> 11:39.542
No, we have to do - it like...

11:39.542 --> 11:40.709
F...

11:40.709 --> 11:41.834
This.

11:44.417 --> 11:45.542
We go all the way down

11:45.542 --> 11:46.667
and I gotta be honest,

11:46.709 --> 11:47.959
I'm still thinking about

11:47.959 --> 11:49.209
how terrified

11:49.209 --> 11:50.792
I just was

11:50.792 --> 11:52.334
about how high I was.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.042
- Like, I almost peed
- like a girl.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.751
- The tour guide
- has water for us.

11:55.792 --> 11:56.918
Sherv, do you want a water?

11:56.918 --> 11:58.209
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.667
- Thank you.
- Sure.

11:59.709 --> 12:00.792
Towel? Tommy, towel?

12:00.792 --> 12:01.876
Yes, please.

12:01.918 --> 12:04.167
I wanna ask you something.

12:04.209 --> 12:05.876
- You know how I'm taking
- everybody's portrait?

12:05.918 --> 12:07.209
It started with my parents.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.083
- They've been together
- 43 years

12:09.125 --> 12:10.417
and I've been taking

12:10.417 --> 12:11.667
everybody's picture.

12:11.709 --> 12:14.083
We should talk about it.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.417
We can do something fun.

12:15.459 --> 12:16.834
My art project about couples

12:16.876 --> 12:19.417
has really evolved and golnesa

12:19.459 --> 12:20.542
is like many,

12:20.542 --> 12:21.584
many women out there.

12:21.584 --> 12:22.626
You know, she doesn't have

12:22.626 --> 12:23.667
a significant person

12:23.709 --> 12:24.834
in her life right now

12:24.834 --> 12:25.918
but she's dating.

12:25.918 --> 12:27.542
- We can make it be really
- cool and creative.

12:27.584 --> 12:29.125
What about on a jet,

12:29.125 --> 12:30.667
drinking champagne?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.209
And that fits actually

12:32.209 --> 12:33.667
perfectly well

12:33.709 --> 12:34.918
into the whole theme

12:34.918 --> 12:36.083
of relationships

12:36.125 --> 12:37.375
between two people.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.876
Okay, this is very

12:38.876 --> 12:40.292
confusing though.

12:40.292 --> 12:42.250
- This isn't directed
- towards you,

12:42.292 --> 12:43.417
it's directed towards her.

12:43.459 --> 12:44.876
Why?

12:44.918 --> 12:45.959
You're asking everyone

12:45.959 --> 12:47.959
- to take a couples picture.
- Yeah.

12:47.959 --> 12:50.083
- So, why are you asking her
- to take a couples picture?

12:50.125 --> 12:51.375
I think the conversation

12:51.375 --> 12:52.626
was between the mouth

12:52.667 --> 12:54.125
- and the ears that were
- supposed to hear it.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.125
- If you do it, great.
- If you don't, then don't.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.375
- It's not a big deal.
- I mean, you know,

12:57.417 --> 12:59.292
- the main thing is,
- situations just like this,

12:59.292 --> 13:00.626
people just wanna talk sh...

13:00.667 --> 13:02.125
It's a lot of focus on me.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.792
- No, it's not even
- focus on you.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.125
I was talking to her, I said,

13:05.125 --> 13:06.626
- "this isn't even
- directed at you."

13:06.626 --> 13:08.542
- But you were talking
- about me in front of me.

13:08.584 --> 13:10.459
I was talking...

13:10.459 --> 13:12.292
You are the most problematic

13:12.292 --> 13:13.417
person to talk to

13:13.417 --> 13:14.542
on planet earth.

13:14.584 --> 13:15.709
Golnesa will turn

13:15.709 --> 13:16.792
on you in a f... ing

13:16.834 --> 13:18.209
heartbeat if she doesn't like

13:18.250 --> 13:19.626
what you have to say.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.834
She's turned on Asa,

13:20.834 --> 13:22.000
she's turned on shervin,

13:22.042 --> 13:23.209
she's turned on mj,

13:23.209 --> 13:24.334
she's turned on Mike

13:24.375 --> 13:25.584
and she's turned

13:25.584 --> 13:26.792
on me several times.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.459
I can't be around that energy.

13:28.501 --> 13:29.667
- If I'm talking about you
- and you're here...

13:29.667 --> 13:31.125
- I don't understand
- why you wanna chime in

13:31.167 --> 13:32.292
all the f... ing time.

13:32.334 --> 13:33.667
- It's none
- of your f... ing business.

13:33.709 --> 13:34.959
- It is my f... ing business.
- I'll chime in what the f...

13:35.000 --> 13:36.250
- I wanna chime in.
- Don't f... ing put

13:36.292 --> 13:37.584
- your f... ing finger
- in my f... ing face like this.

13:37.626 --> 13:38.834
- I'll chime in when the f...
- I wanna chime in.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.125
- [Inaudible] No,
- you're not gonna chime in

13:40.167 --> 13:41.250
- on my f... ing life [Inaudible].
- I'll chime in whenever

13:41.292 --> 13:42.626
- the f... I want.
- Chime in on your life.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.417
Focus on your own sh...

13:44.417 --> 13:46.167
Focus on your own sh...

13:46.167 --> 13:47.626
- You're fake as f...
- And everyone's sick

13:47.667 --> 13:49.167
- and tired of your bullsh...
- I'm fake as f...?

13:49.209 --> 13:50.959
- Yes.
- I'm fake as f...?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.459
Why are you talking to nothing?

13:52.501 --> 13:53.959
It's going to my heart, ahh.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.918
My inflammation

13:55.918 --> 13:57.834
has reached my heart.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.834
Yeah.

13:59.876 --> 14:01.000
- You just can't walk away,
- can you?

14:01.042 --> 14:02.042
- How many stories?
- Chemotherapy.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.125
- Why are you talking
- to nothing?

14:03.167 --> 14:05.000
Why have you had chemotherapy?

14:05.042 --> 14:06.959
- Why are there stories out
- that you've had chemotherapy?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.167
- Why are you talking
- to nothing?

14:08.209 --> 14:09.459
I'm really over

14:09.459 --> 14:10.709
golnesa's lies.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.459
All over social media,

14:12.501 --> 14:14.209
talking about her heart,

14:14.209 --> 14:15.792
chemotherapy.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.083
In the next moment,

14:17.125 --> 14:18.375
she's dancing,

14:18.375 --> 14:20.167
drinking, smoking

14:20.167 --> 14:21.918
and popping off.

14:23.584 --> 14:25.375
- I'm fake as f...
- Keep going.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.501
- You're pathetic
- is what you are.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.000
I'm enjoying it.

14:28.042 --> 14:29.542
- You don't get along
- with anyone.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.167
- You were fighting
- with him yesterday.

14:31.209 --> 14:32.501
You fought with him.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.459
- You fight with him,
- you fight with her,

14:34.501 --> 14:36.000
now it's my turn today?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.375
You have no relevance other

14:37.375 --> 14:38.667
than everybody else's business.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.459
You focus on everybody's

14:40.459 --> 14:42.209
business but your own.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.417
I really don't understand

14:43.417 --> 14:44.584
Reza's obsession right now

14:44.626 --> 14:45.876
with my health.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.250
If you're not gonna be there

14:47.250 --> 14:48.292
to support me

14:48.292 --> 14:49.334
in a positive way,

14:49.375 --> 14:51.209
don't consume your whole life

14:51.250 --> 14:52.334
to come after me

14:52.334 --> 14:53.375
in a negative way.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.083
- You're nothing, nothing.
- I'm nothing, I know.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.125

24:24.167 --> 24:25.417
You probably don't

24:25.417 --> 24:26.667
understand it, you know,

24:26.667 --> 24:28.417
- but sometimes you fight
- with your brother.

24:28.459 --> 24:29.834
Grown-ups are like that, too.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.292
Sometimes they want different

24:31.292 --> 24:32.751
things at different times.

- not to fight.

You know, I put myself

25:36.584 --> 25:37.792

Are you looking

26:10.959 --> 26:12.167

- We're looking for
- something very, very special.

- Yeah, I want something
- very grand.

26:15.751 --> 26:17.584

26:17.584 --> 26:19.083
"i love you, I'm sorry."

- "You're the most beautiful

26:27.292 --> 26:29.250
his love, his passion.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.459
mostly this one.

- You like this one
- or you like red?

26:35.250 --> 26:36.542
Both.

26:36.542 --> 26:37.792
Why five dozen roses?

26:37.792 --> 26:39.626
Because it's obvious,

26:39.667 --> 26:41.417
5 times 12 is like,

26:41.417 --> 26:43.125

70...

26:44.792 --> 26:47.209
10, 50, 12, 62.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.083
I have a reason,

26:49.083 --> 26:50.876
because Jews like the number 26

26:50.918 --> 26:52.125
and if you reverse that 62,

26:52.125 --> 26:53.292
you get 26

26:53.334 --> 26:54.417

26:54.417 --> 26:55.459
of roses, okay?

- You think this is better
- or that one?

26:56.751 --> 26:58.375

28:13.250 --> 28:14.959
- You look good.
- Good.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Okay, so how was it?

28:18.042 --> 28:19.292
It was good.

28:19.334 --> 28:21.000
We climbed up the Mayan ruins

28:21.042 --> 28:23.959
and it was really high,

28:24.000 --> 28:25.292
really long and my knees

28:25.292 --> 28:26.542
were just shaking,

28:26.542 --> 28:28.375
it was really painful for me.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.542
Yeah.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.292
- I need to start a new
- medication

28:32.334 --> 28:34.375
because it's just not...

28:34.375 --> 28:36.542
I'm tired all the time,

28:36.584 --> 28:37.834
I'm in pain,

28:37.834 --> 28:39.083
I can't deal with it anymore.

28:39.083 --> 28:40.292
My fingers are the size

28:40.292 --> 28:41.501
of sausages right now.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.167
Having received

28:43.167 --> 28:44.751
my test results and it being,

28:44.751 --> 28:46.751
- you know, not such great news
- and that chemo

28:46.792 --> 28:49.125
is my only option

28:49.125 --> 28:51.417
at this point is so scary,

28:51.459 --> 28:53.250
but I have no choice.

28:53.292 --> 28:55.042
- If it's the chemo,
- then we do the chemo.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.501
- No, I don't want
- you to do that.

28:56.542 --> 28:58.334
You have to stop saying that.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.709
99 percent of the reason

28:59.709 --> 29:01.000
I've held off

29:01.042 --> 29:02.626
on doing chemo

29:02.626 --> 29:04.167
is because of my mom.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.083
- She's just never
- gonna be okay with it

29:06.083 --> 29:07.667
and I know that,

29:07.667 --> 29:09.209
but I'm in pain

29:09.250 --> 29:11.334
and I need some relief.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.292
You're not understanding my

29:13.292 --> 29:15.209
level of pain for five years.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.501
I'm tired.

29:16.542 --> 29:19.209
I think before going through

29:19.250 --> 29:22.876
such a harsh drugs

29:22.918 --> 29:24.542
that cause lots

29:24.542 --> 29:26.125
of other side effects,

29:26.125 --> 29:28.125
maybe do something like

29:28.125 --> 29:30.125
have a diet for five,

29:30.125 --> 29:32.083
six months that it's a very

29:32.083 --> 29:34.042
controlled diet.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.542
So you want me to just

29:35.542 --> 29:36.959
keep going to holistic things

29:37.000 --> 29:38.542
that aren't doing anything?

29:38.584 --> 29:40.501
I can't function anymore

29:40.501 --> 29:42.417
as a normal human being.

29:42.459 --> 29:44.125
You are an adult,

29:44.125 --> 29:45.918
you are responsible

29:45.959 --> 29:47.042
for all of your actions.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.626
- I just don't think
- you're understanding

29:48.626 --> 29:50.042
what I'm saying to you.

29:50.042 --> 29:51.459
No, I do understand.

29:51.459 --> 29:53.083
- No, you don't understand...
- It's hard but you have

29:53.125 --> 29:54.959
to step small steps to do it.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.751
You're not listening to me.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.459
You shouldn't get agitated

29:58.459 --> 30:00.167
- because it's not good for you.
- Yeah.

30:00.167 --> 30:02.501
- So, you wanna send me
- to Israel to go to the dead sea.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.876
When that doesn't work, are

30:03.876 --> 30:05.250
you gonna send me to Zimbabwe?

30:05.292 --> 30:06.709
I'm gonna call Dr. Wallace

30:06.709 --> 30:08.083
and I'm gonna do the chemo.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.667
- Right.
- That's it.

30:09.667 --> 30:12.334
With ra, chemo goes in

30:12.334 --> 30:15.250
and the cells that are confused,

30:15.292 --> 30:16.959
it kind of puts them in check

30:16.959 --> 30:18.626
and it corrects them.

30:18.667 --> 30:19.959
I still have to sit in a chair

30:19.959 --> 30:21.292
for five hours

30:21.334 --> 30:22.876
with the iv, just as,

30:22.876 --> 30:24.417
you know, cancer patients do.

30:24.459 --> 30:26.292
- I still get the same
- side effects,

30:26.334 --> 30:28.000
but if it helps with my ra,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.667
it's worth it.

30:29.709 --> 30:31.125
I'm tired of being irritated,

30:31.167 --> 30:32.501
I'm tired of not sleeping,

30:32.542 --> 30:34.501
- I'm tired of being a bitch

38:47.459 --> 38:49.292
- as rez and golnesa
- are right now,

38:49.334 --> 38:50.542
it's actually really

38:50.542 --> 38:51.751
difficult on the whole group.

38:51.792 --> 38:53.626
- And as for me,
- I actually don't really

38:53.667 --> 38:54.667
like to take sides.

38:54.709 --> 38:55.834
I just wanted to be here

38:55.834 --> 38:56.959
today for golnesa.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.459
- I don't know
- that much what's going on

38:58.501 --> 38:59.542
with her but f..., like,

38:59.542 --> 39:00.584
I didn't realize

39:00.626 --> 39:02.167
how serious this was.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.876
- It's hard for me to see
- and it's like, damn,

39:03.918 --> 39:05.667
this is for real.

39:09.709 --> 39:10.959
Coming up...

39:10.959 --> 39:12.167
Are you feeling okay?

39:12.209 --> 39:14.375
- Yeah.
- Mom, she's on drugs right now.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.542
They gave her sedatives.

39:16.584 --> 39:19.042
How much can I fake this iv?

39:19.083 --> 39:21.292
I mean, it's not fake.

39:29.209 --> 39:30.292
- [Speaking farsi]
- [Inaudible]

39:30.334 --> 39:32.876
Long time, no see.

39:32.876 --> 39:34.334
Under these conditions, I don't

39:34.375 --> 39:35.834
wanna see you like this but...

39:35.876 --> 39:37.792
I'm fine.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.626
- Hi, Anita joon.
- Hey.

39:42.042 --> 39:44.250
How's our monkey?

39:44.292 --> 39:45.751
Hi, monkey.

39:54.083 --> 39:55.792
I'm not a victim

39:55.792 --> 39:57.501
and I will never be a victim.

39:57.542 --> 39:58.626
People can make fun of me,

39:58.626 --> 39:59.709
they can call me fake,

39:59.751 --> 40:02.000
but how much can I fake

40:02.000 --> 40:04.250
this six hours of chemo?

40:04.292 --> 40:05.584
It's not fake.

40:05.626 --> 40:07.042
- He said the damage
- that's already done

40:07.083 --> 40:08.501
he can't reverse,

40:08.501 --> 40:09.918
but he can prevent...

40:09.959 --> 40:11.375
Inshallah.

40:11.417 --> 40:12.584
Yeah, inshallah.

40:12.626 --> 40:14.083
At this point, I just want

40:14.125 --> 40:15.584
positivity around me,

40:15.626 --> 40:17.042
I want people to remind me

40:17.083 --> 40:18.876
that things are gonna be okay.

40:21.459 --> 40:23.167
Feeling okay?

40:23.209 --> 40:24.250
Hi, mom.

40:25.292 --> 40:26.792
How are you?

40:26.792 --> 40:27.792
Good.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.083
Good?

40:30.792 --> 40:32.417
Are you feeling okay?

40:32.459 --> 40:33.959
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.459
Mom, she's on drugs right now,

40:35.501 --> 40:37.083
they gave her sedatives.

40:41.751 --> 40:42.918
Thank you.

40:43.959 --> 40:45.209
I see you survived.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.959
I survived.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.292
Tomorrow, if you're gonna

40:48.292 --> 40:49.584
feel anything,

40:49.626 --> 40:51.125
would be the worst day.

40:51.125 --> 40:53.125
- Tomorrow?
- Maybe a little nauseous.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.125
- 20 percent chance.
- Yeah, 20.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.584
And 80 percent chance

40:55.584 --> 40:56.959
you'll be fine.

40:56.959 --> 40:58.792
- Is this like, chemo,
- like cancer chemo?

40:58.834 --> 41:00.584
- Yeah.
- What's going on, like...?

41:00.626 --> 41:01.709
This drug is used

41:01.709 --> 41:02.792
for rheumatoid arthritis,

41:02.792 --> 41:04.918
it's also given to some people

41:04.959 --> 41:06.125
who have lymphomas.

41:06.125 --> 41:07.667
- So, it's not like
- chemotherapy,

41:07.709 --> 41:09.334
the way cancer patients?

41:09.375 --> 41:10.542
It's the same medicine

41:10.542 --> 41:11.667
but it's not the same dose.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.834
- She's not gonna lose
- her hair, none of that stuff?

41:13.834 --> 41:15.667
- You don't lose your hair
- with this.

41:15.709 --> 41:17.292
- Can she do something
- to improve,

41:17.334 --> 41:18.709
like as far as diet,

41:18.751 --> 41:20.125
lifestyle?

41:20.167 --> 41:21.417
- Stop smoking.
- Okay.

41:21.459 --> 41:23.334
- Can you please turn back?
- Monkey.

41:23.334 --> 41:25.167
Can you turn back towards her?

41:25.167 --> 41:26.959
Monkey, listen.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.501
- Can you turn towards
- her and tell her

41:28.542 --> 41:30.459
- she needs help
- for other things, please?

41:30.501 --> 41:31.584
- Let's take the focus off
- of me right now.

41:31.626 --> 41:32.959
- He...
- I'm not here

41:33.000 --> 41:34.334
- for a game right now.
- Alright.

41:34.334 --> 41:36.250
- This is not funny to me.
- No, it's not.

41:36.292 --> 41:38.083
- Okay, well then stop.
- But he says you don't

41:38.125 --> 41:39.125
have to smoke.

41:39.125 --> 41:40.125
You shouldn't smoke.

41:40.167 --> 41:41.292
I swear,

41:41.292 --> 41:42.417
you never know when to stop.

41:42.459 --> 41:43.501
- You don't.
- Alright.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.334
- I can't, mom.
- Thank you, doctor.

41:45.375 --> 41:46.584
You wanna go heal the world?

41:46.626 --> 41:48.125
Go, do what mother Teresa did.

41:49.209 --> 41:50.209
You don't get it.

41:50.209 --> 41:51.375
Babe, I'm taking you home,

41:51.375 --> 41:52.459
where are you going?

41:52.459 --> 41:53.542
You don't get it.

41:53.584 --> 41:55.125
- That's my arm, move.
- Oh, okay.

41:55.167 --> 41:56.792
I just had a needle in my

41:56.792 --> 41:58.375
vein, getting medicine.

41:58.375 --> 41:59.459
I'm nauseous,

41:59.459 --> 42:00.542
the last thing I wanna hear

42:00.542 --> 42:02.292
is a f... ing lecture.

42:02.334 --> 42:04.209
- But there's a time
- and a place, Asa joon.

42:04.250 --> 42:05.626
But do you think it's bullsh...

42:05.667 --> 42:06.876
- Or do you think it would
- actually help you?

42:06.918 --> 42:08.709
- No, I 100 percent
- think it's real

42:08.709 --> 42:10.292
but I'm not going to quit.

42:10.334 --> 42:11.542
Why?

42:11.584 --> 42:13.125
Because I don't want to.

42:15.209 --> 42:17.459
Everything is confusing me.

42:17.501 --> 42:18.542
If you're really that sick,

42:18.542 --> 42:19.667
- then why are you
- drinking so much?

42:19.709 --> 42:21.000
Why are you smoking?

42:21.042 --> 42:22.959
- Let's go.
- Okay.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
We are trying to help

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
you in your life

42:25.042 --> 42:26.834
- and I wish golnesa
- would see that

42:26.876 --> 42:28.834
but she's running away.

42:30.542 --> 42:31.918
Bye.

42:31.918 --> 42:33.584
Bye.

42:33.626 --> 42:35.584
Next on - "shahs of sunset..."

42:35.584 --> 42:37.501
- We're looking at the colors
- that you and I spoke about.

42:37.542 --> 42:38.751
We have an event coming up.

42:38.751 --> 42:39.792
These shoes are actually

42:39.792 --> 42:40.834
gonna be sold that night.

42:40.876 --> 42:42.834
- They were supposed
- to come across the border.

42:42.876 --> 42:44.459
My f... ing shoes are stuck

42:44.459 --> 42:46.042
at customs in Mexico.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.918
Where's Mike?

42:47.918 --> 42:49.083
This will be a good place

42:49.083 --> 42:50.250
to come when we have a kid.

42:50.292 --> 42:51.334
Kid.

42:51.334 --> 42:52.334
The doctor is telling me

42:52.375 --> 42:53.709
that we're ready

42:53.709 --> 42:55.000
but is my relationship

42:55.042 --> 42:56.209
telling me that I'm ready?

42:56.250 --> 42:57.918
- You know, you may have
- thought that my date

42:57.918 --> 42:59.000
with Annalise was like

42:59.000 --> 43:00.083
a terrible disaster.

43:00.125 --> 43:01.918
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

43:01.959 --> 43:03.083
But she wanted to see me

43:03.083 --> 43:04.209
again after,

43:04.250 --> 43:05.584
shocker.

43:05.626 --> 43:06.959
Mj and I have been hearing

43:06.959 --> 43:08.250
rumors about Jessica.

43:08.250 --> 43:10.250
Oh my god, what?

43:10.250 --> 43:11.876
Oh my god.

43:12.959 --> 43:14.209
