00:38.806 --> 00:42.241
All right, I want you all
to imagine a room

00:42.276 --> 00:45.344
immaculately decorated
for Christmas.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.414
Perfect tree, perfect stockings.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.349
A mother comes in

00:50.384 --> 00:54.553
and sees her little boy
waiting by the Christmas tree.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.055
It's his bedtime,

00:56.090 --> 00:59.892
but he tells her
he's too excited to sleep.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.127
The mother asks the little boy

01:02.196 --> 01:06.832
if maybe a cup of hot chocolate
will help him fall asleep.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.400
The little boy answers,

01:08.469 --> 01:14.406
"Only if it's made
with Silky Cocoa Mix".

01:15.776 --> 01:17.576
The mom brings her son

01:17.611 --> 01:20.245
a steaming hot mug
of Silky Cocoa,

01:20.281 --> 01:22.614
and he loves it.

01:22.650 --> 01:27.286
The mom asks if maybe now
he can go to sleep.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.987
The little boy answers,

01:29.056 --> 01:33.759
"Only if you leave a mug
of Silky Cocoa out for Santa".

01:33.794 --> 01:36.261
That's when the father
comes out and says,

01:36.330 --> 01:39.498
"That's a great idea!
Santa would love a cup".

01:39.533 --> 01:41.166
Silky Cocoa.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.169
Now, this is Christmas.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.411
Well, I don't know
about you all,

01:52.446 --> 01:55.981
but I could sure go for a cup of
hot Silky Cocoa right about now.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.052
You really hit that one
out of park.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.832
They're thinking about
signing long term.

02:01.856 --> 02:04.089
Who knows?

02:04.125 --> 02:06.036
You keep moving like that,
you might find a little bonus

02:06.060 --> 02:07.571
under your tree
Christmas morning.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.061
Thank you, Ellis.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.683
Sounds like
they loved the pitch.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.065
Well, when you're doing
a Christmas ad,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.434
you're selling people a fantasy.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.835
It's not supposed to be real.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.237
So that's why you don't have

02:18.272 --> 02:19.304
a Christmas tree.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.772
I don't have a Christmas tree

02:20.808 --> 02:22.552
because I don't like
vacuuming needles.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.077
Whatever you say, Scrooge.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.479
Bah humbug.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.485
Brian Anderson called again.
He has been very persistent.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.854
That's because
my great-aunt Helen

02:35.890 --> 02:37.589
passed away four months ago,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.158
and he's handling her estate.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.393
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.362
That's okay.
Knowing Aunt Helen,

02:43.430 --> 02:46.765
she probably left me
her rare spoon collection

02:46.834 --> 02:48.500
or her ventriloquist dummy.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.380
At the very least,
I'll deal with it later.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.703
Okay.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.206
Oh, no, you don't have
to clean up.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.209
If I don't,
who's gonna save your artwork?

02:57.244 --> 03:01.413
Actually, I'm getting kind of
a modernist vibe with this one.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.714
Those are just doodles.

03:02.816 --> 03:03.982
Jen.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.795
I heard you knocked it
out of the park

03:05.819 --> 03:07.286
with that Silky Cocoa pitch.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.765
It's a good thing
I was out of town

03:08.789 --> 03:09.966
when they assigned that account.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.024
Gave you a chance to show off.

03:12.059 --> 03:12.958
Good thing.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.928
By the way,

03:15.963 --> 03:18.864
I overheard Ellis
on the phone earlier.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.833
Sounds like Tyler's going to be
leaving before Christmas.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.513
That means they're
going to have to hire

03:23.537 --> 03:25.837
a new creative director
before the holidays.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.008
How's your quota going anyway?

03:30.044 --> 03:33.312
You're, what, three,
four accounts behind?

03:33.414 --> 03:34.446
Five.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.114
Well...

03:36.150 --> 03:38.584
good luck to us both, right?

03:42.156 --> 03:45.724
Forget her. She is not half the
creative genius that you are.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.693
- Thanks.
- And don't forget.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.139
You're meeting Irene
for drinks tonight.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.029
Tonight? Can you see if...

03:51.065 --> 03:53.432
You've already rescheduled
four times.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.068
I'll be there at seven.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.103
Thirty!

03:57.171 --> 03:59.538
Ish!

04:12.553 --> 04:16.387
Irene, I am so sorry I'm late.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.390
I'm just glad that you made it.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.293
I told Bill I was shocked
that you didn't reschedule.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.029
And how are things going
with him anyway?

04:24.064 --> 04:25.597
Actually, really well.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.766
Too well.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.102
I keep waiting for something
to be terribly wrong,

04:30.204 --> 04:31.982
like does he put ketchup
on his spaghetti.

04:32.006 --> 04:35.207
Maybe he has a secret
reptile room in his apartment.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.409
Oh, I've missed you.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.811
I missed you.
So stop working so much.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.248
I can't. I have this huge
promotion coming up.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.549
Creative director.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.719
But no matter how hard I work,

04:47.788 --> 04:49.621
I can't seem to catch up
to Karen.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.691
Are you kidding?
If I worked half as hard as you,

04:52.726 --> 04:54.860
I'd be the best realtor
in San Francisco.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.130
Well, the difference is
you actually have a social life.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.532
- Speaking of which...
- Nope.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.212
- Bill has this friend Tom.
- Not gonna happen.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.903
- Oh, he's so cute.
- You said that the last time.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.440
How are you supposed to meet
anyone when you're working 24/7?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.242
Well, the right guy
will understand

05:10.311 --> 05:13.312
that my work and my success
is important to me,

05:13.347 --> 05:15.380
and he will love me for that.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.349
Okay, well,

05:17.418 --> 05:20.585
when you meet this alien
from an alternate reality,

05:20.654 --> 05:21.953
you'll have to let me know.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.155
- Deal.
- All right.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.123
Cheers to love though.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.868
Mom?

05:43.177 --> 05:46.178
Hi, honey! You're on speaker.
Dad's here too.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.957
Where are you?
I thought you'd be off sailing.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.282
We made a pit stop in Hawaii.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.418
<i>The life of a retiree.</i>

05:53.487 --> 05:55.721
Well, I'm glad you two
finally have service.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.156
It's nice to hear your voices.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.136
Which reminds me,
we just got a bunch of messages

06:00.160 --> 06:01.727
from Aunt Helen's lawyer.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.129
Yeah. He's been calling me
nonstop too.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.032
I think you should take the time
to call him back.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.633
I will, eventually.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.813
<i>You'll never guess
what Aunt Helen left me</i>

06:09.837 --> 06:11.269
in her will.

06:11.305 --> 06:14.339
An adopted elephant
from a reservation in Kenya.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.319
She doesn't have to guess
if you tell her.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.521
She never was gonna guess
about an elephant in Kenya.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.011
You don't know that.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.947
That sounds like Aunt Helen.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.949
<i>He didn't tell us
what she left you,</i>

06:24.017 --> 06:26.785
only said that it was
confidential and time-sensitive,

06:26.820 --> 06:29.388
so I think you better
call him back soon.

06:29.423 --> 06:33.558
<i>- Probably her spoon collection.
- No, I got that.</i>

06:33.594 --> 06:36.194
I got those too.
Spoons and elephants.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.030
Fine. I'll call him
first thing tomorrow.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.899
And, honey, honey, please,

06:40.934 --> 06:44.836
promise us you will take
some time off for the holidays.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.516
Don't be like us
and wait till you're old

06:46.540 --> 06:49.408
to finally start relaxing
and have some time for yourself.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.477
I won't, I won't.
I promise.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.045
<i>All right, gotta run, honey.</i>

06:54.148 --> 06:55.347
Got a scuba lesson in five.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.450
Since when do you two
scuba dive?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.052
Started right after
that whole snorkeling thing.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.454
<i>What snorkeling thing?</i>

07:02.556 --> 07:04.389
Bye! We love you!

07:04.491 --> 07:05.791
Love ya.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.194
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.234
Brian Anderson.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.376
This is Brian.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.578
Hi. This is Jen Taylor.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.481
You've been trying to reach me
about my Aunt Helen's will?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.616
So you do have a phone.

07:31.652 --> 07:35.387
I have a demanding job.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.922
I am sure you do.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.690
<i>So what did she leave me?</i>

07:38.792 --> 07:41.193
The ventriloquist dummy?

07:41.228 --> 07:44.262
That depends,
if it's inside the inn.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.363
What do you mean?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.767
Let's see here.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.505
All right, here we go.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.241
"I, Helen Taylor,

07:56.276 --> 08:00.078
<i>do hereby bequeath to my niece
Jennifer my beloved inn,</i>

08:00.113 --> 08:02.013
<i>located in Chestnut Hill,
Alaska".</i>

08:02.049 --> 08:03.682
Wait, what did you just say?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.094
So legally speaking,
that would include

08:05.118 --> 08:07.052
any mannequins
left inside, yeah.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.189
<i>Hello? You still there?</i>

08:11.291 --> 08:13.992
She left me the inn.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.628
Yeah, so all you gotta do now
is come up here to Chestnut Hill

08:16.663 --> 08:18.463
and claim the property.

08:18.532 --> 08:22.400
Come to Chestnut Hill, Alaska?

08:22.436 --> 08:24.236
Although for tax purposes,

08:24.271 --> 08:26.115
I'd would try to get here
before the end of the year.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.672
It's almost Christmas.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.775
I can't just up and leave
my job right now.

08:30.811 --> 08:34.011
Then maybe you should've
answered my call the first time.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.414
Alaska?

08:37.484 --> 08:38.794
I'm supposed to claim
the property

08:38.818 --> 08:40.085
by the end of the year.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.587
Look, I know it's close
to the holidays,

08:42.655 --> 08:44.890
and I know we've got some
board meetings coming up,

08:44.925 --> 08:47.626
but if you want, I could stall.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.862
You know what?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.030
Go.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.165
Wait, what?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.701
Jennifer, you have worked here
for seven years.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.837
How many vacation days
have you taken?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.372
- Two.
- Besides that time

09:00.440 --> 09:02.280
you got your wisdom teeth
taken out.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.143
Exactly.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.679
Go take some time off.
You've earned it.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.448
Yeah, but I'm still working
on the Wilkins account,

09:10.484 --> 09:12.395
and we've only just started
on the Silky Cocoa.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.319
Don't worry.
I'll pick up the slack.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.589
After all, we're just a few
accounts off quota, aren't we?

09:17.624 --> 09:19.457
Look, I won't be gone for long.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.259
Long enough
to sign the paperwork

09:21.295 --> 09:23.061
and start the sale process.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.430
You know, just in case
you might have

09:25.532 --> 09:27.399
any decisions to make.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.769
Well, you think you might
be back by Christmas?

09:30.837 --> 09:33.071
Because after we choose
the new creative director,

09:33.140 --> 09:36.107
we're gonna need all hands on
deck to rearrange our accounts.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.143
All hands on deck.
Absolutely.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.711
Okay.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.091
Okay, so don't worry.
I'll start putting feelers out

09:53.160 --> 09:54.771
to my commercial property
contacts,

09:54.795 --> 09:57.295
so just send me photos
of the inn when you can.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.797
I'll do just that.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.443
Okay. I promise
we're going to get this place

10:00.467 --> 10:02.000
off the market by Christmas.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.935
You are the best.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.537
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.753
Hi. Is this the pickup area?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.221
It's as good as any.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.056
There's not really
a parking lot here.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.359
Hey, you didn't come in off the
San Francisco flight, did you?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.662
- Yes.
- I don't suppose there was

11:03.697 --> 11:06.264
an older woman on your plane,
maybe in her late-sixties,

11:06.299 --> 11:09.668
face buried in her work,
ignoring important phone calls?

11:09.703 --> 11:12.070
Wait, are you Brian Anderson?

11:12.105 --> 11:13.471
Are you Jen Taylor?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.108
I'm so sorry.
I just...

11:17.144 --> 11:20.612
No, that's okay. I usually have
my face buried in my work.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.291
No, I was just expecting
someone older,

11:22.315 --> 11:25.483
like much, much older.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.585
Helen is my great-aunt.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.399
In my defense,
you did ignore my phone calls.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.234
In my defense, I didn't know
I was left an inn.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.669
Well, how would you have known
unless you answered your phone?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.437
- Are you my ride?
- Appears that way.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.694
Then shall we?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.462
Jen?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.843
So if you were
my aunt's attorney,

11:51.912 --> 11:54.913
why does this truck say,
"custom-made sleighs?"

11:54.948 --> 11:56.514
Because I also build sleighs.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.784
That clears that up.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.387
Chestnut Hill is a small town.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.389
People wear many hats.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.591
Which hat did you
go to school for?

12:06.626 --> 12:09.127
And what is it that you do
that's so incredibly important

12:09.196 --> 12:11.396
that you can't answer the phone?

12:11.465 --> 12:12.530
Advertising.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.032
So you lie for a living.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.967
I don't lie.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.602
Isn't that what ads are,

12:17.637 --> 12:19.804
making something look better
than it actually is?

12:19.873 --> 12:23.908
I think of it as showing someone
what something could be,

12:23.944 --> 12:25.810
under the best circumstances.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.913
Speaking of best circumstances,

12:28.949 --> 12:30.827
how come you never came up here
to visit your aunt before?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.617
Well, let me guess.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.853
'Cause work's more important
than family.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.654
That is not true.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.930
Well, you're not spending
Christmas with them, are you?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.659
You're the one who told me
how important it was

12:41.695 --> 12:43.194
to come up here.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.064
And if I hadn't,
you'd be with them?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.833
That's what I thought.

12:48.869 --> 12:53.071
Well, if you must know,
my parents are traveling.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.141
My dad recently retired
and wanted to see the world.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.143
Happy?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.789
Listen, the sooner
we get this taken care of,

12:59.813 --> 13:02.347
the sooner I can get back
to San Francisco.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.916
You mean, the sooner
you can get back to work.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.417
Just so you know,

13:06.453 --> 13:08.987
your aunt's inn
means a lot to this town.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.967
I really hope you're not
gonna rush into anything

13:10.991 --> 13:14.359
and just sell it off
to the highest bidder.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.624
Well, here we are.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.894
It's actually really cute.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.563
Of course.
What were you expecting?

13:51.598 --> 13:55.900
I don't know. Maybe something
a little more run-down?

13:55.969 --> 13:58.047
I've been meaning to put up
some Christmas decorations,

13:58.071 --> 14:00.772
but I just hadn't been
able to find the time.

14:00.807 --> 14:04.442
But hey, now that you're here,
you can do it.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.712
I told you, I don't really...

14:07.747 --> 14:09.714
No, your aunt always
made sure the inn

14:09.749 --> 14:11.816
had the best decorations
every year.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.519
Well, I'm pretty sure
the town will survive

14:14.554 --> 14:16.788
if I don't hang up
a few twinkle lights.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.957
I don't know.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.826
No, no, no, I got it, I got it.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.595
Okay.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.374
You don't want me
to help you get settled?

14:25.398 --> 14:28.433
I think I can handle
unlocking a door.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.068
By the way, the paperwork

14:30.103 --> 14:31.970
for the transfer
of the property.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.340
Just come by tomorrow
whenever you're ready to sign.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.775
My office is
right around the corner.

14:39.613 --> 14:42.780
Pleasure!

14:42.816 --> 14:45.183
Help me get settled?

14:45.218 --> 14:48.052
How hard can it possibly be?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.132
There!

15:01.201 --> 15:02.934
Piece of cake.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.815
How'd it go?

15:17.884 --> 15:20.885
She is nothing like her aunt.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.988
She's rude and snarky
and kinda mean.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.258
Are you sure it wasn't your...

15:27.294 --> 15:29.994
"I'm super unwelcome
to outsiders" vibe?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.196
I don't have a vibe like that.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.665
She just got here.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.413
You don't know
what she's going to do.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.672
Molly's.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.308
A fire? Where?

15:44.577 --> 15:45.543
The inn?

15:45.578 --> 15:47.445
Oh, no. Jen!

15:52.986 --> 15:54.252
Jen!

15:56.356 --> 15:57.388
Jen!

15:59.159 --> 16:00.458
Jen?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.560
Jen!

16:02.595 --> 16:04.529
What happened?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.242
I just made a fire,
and all of the sudden,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.132
the room started
filling up with smoke.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.670
Did you open the damper?

16:12.706 --> 16:14.305
What's a damper?

16:19.045 --> 16:21.679
If the damper's closed,
the smoke's got nowhere to go.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.916
The only fireplaces I ever used
came with a switch.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.684
Shocker.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.964
You know,
this is all your fault.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.154
My fault?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.767
You could've mentioned
there was no heat.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.624
You were so sure of yourself,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.371
I didn't get around to telling
you that I winterized the place.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.261
Well, can you un-winterize it?

16:37.297 --> 16:40.298
Preferably before I lose
all sensation in my toes.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.339
Here.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.885
There's a little cafe around
the corner called Molly's.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.976
Why don't you go there,
you warm up,

16:52.012 --> 16:53.745
I'll meet you there.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.079
Thank you.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.090
Switch.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.502
You poor thing.
Are you all right?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.130
I just forgot
to open the damper.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.006
You must be Jen, Helen's niece.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.508
Great-niece.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.310
Well, I'm Molly,
and this is my daughter Beth.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.079
- Hi.
- What happened?

17:28.114 --> 17:30.159
The guy who dropped me off
neglected to mention

17:30.183 --> 17:32.550
that there was no heat
in the inn.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.485
Well, I'll have to have
a talk with him.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.454
Let me get you some tea.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.955
Thank you.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.229
Wait, are these Aunt Helen's?

17:45.265 --> 17:47.598
She was such a great artist.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.168
Yeah. She taught me how to
sketch when I was young.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.669
Really? Do you still draw?

17:51.704 --> 17:56.040
Not unless you count
coffee cups and napkins.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.953
I still enjoy it.
I just don't have the time.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.610
She'd probably be disappointed.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.012
I doubt that.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.025
She always spoke about you
with such pride.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.916
Really?

18:04.951 --> 18:06.651
Were you two close?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.219
When I was young.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.232
But when I went to college,
and I started my career,

18:10.256 --> 18:12.368
I didn't keep up with her
as much as I should've.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.492
Well, I'm sure she understood.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.462
Every afternoon, she and Eddie
would sit in that corner.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.764
She would sketch,
and he would play cards.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.265
Right.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.402
You have the same smile,
you know?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.473
This is Aunt Helen's recipe.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.809
Slow-cooked apples
with cranberries,

18:31.845 --> 18:33.411
just a dash of cinnamon.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.713
I make it
every Christmas season.

18:35.748 --> 18:36.748
It's perfect.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.182
Thank you.

18:41.154 --> 18:45.957
Heat, electric, and water
are all back on.

18:46.059 --> 18:49.093
Thank goodness.
Thank you so much.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.962
This place is so lovely,

18:51.064 --> 18:52.897
and you two have been
so welcoming.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.743
We're just happy
that you finally made it

18:54.767 --> 18:56.067
to Chestnut Hill.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.869
I just hope you stay awhile.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.438
Don't hold your breath.
She's just here to sell the inn.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.639
Ain't that right?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.875
Please excuse my son's rudeness.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.410
I'm sorry, your son?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.412
Yeah, the one and only.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.951
But you both are
so nice and sweet.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.787
Well, if he gives you any
trouble, you just let me know.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.790
Thank you so much for the tea.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.926
You're welcome.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.061
Stop by tomorrow!

19:26.499 --> 19:28.099
Lovely girl.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.685
Okay, Irene.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.856
Wait until your buyers
get their eyes on this place.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.365
What a cutie.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.212
Must be Eddie.

21:08.268 --> 21:11.636
<i>I've spent my entire
life traveling the world,</i>

21:11.671 --> 21:15.139
<i>and I have never seen a town
so full of charm and wonder</i>

21:15.174 --> 21:17.074
<i>as Chestnut Hill.</i>

21:17.110 --> 21:19.677
<i>I'm so glad I arrived
during the best time of year,</i>

21:19.712 --> 21:20.712
<i>Christmas.</i>

21:20.847 --> 21:22.546
<i>It is enchanting.</i>

21:22.615 --> 21:26.817
<i>I also found a perfect little
cafe called Molly's.</i>

21:26.853 --> 21:30.788
<i>A sweet woman with
two young kids runs the place.</i>

21:30.823 --> 21:32.790
Would that be you, Brian?

21:32.825 --> 21:35.626
<i>Her husband works next door
as the town lawyer,</i>

21:35.728 --> 21:39.163
<i>and it's always full
of the nicest people.</i>

21:39.232 --> 21:43.067
<i>Today I met a man there,
about my age, named Eddie.</i>

21:43.102 --> 21:45.736
<i>I challenged him
to a game of bridge.</i>

21:45.772 --> 21:48.973
<i>He was very surprised
when I whupped his butt.</i>

21:49.008 --> 21:51.809
<i>For some reason, he thought
he was good at the game,</i>

21:51.878 --> 21:54.245
<i>so we scheduled a rematch
for tomorrow.</i>

21:54.280 --> 21:56.314
<i>It'll be nice to see him agai.</i>

22:15.868 --> 22:17.201
Thank you, Beth.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.714
How was your first night
at the inn?

22:18.738 --> 22:21.772
You know, the beds
are very comfortable,

22:21.808 --> 22:23.941
but the kitchen was empty.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.910
You must be starving.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.756
I'm actually headed
to Brian's office

22:27.780 --> 22:28.860
to drop off some paperwork.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.415
Sit.
It's on the house.

22:33.252 --> 22:35.152
What would you recommend?

22:35.221 --> 22:37.288
Turkey club's
the best thing on the menu!

22:37.323 --> 22:38.689
David, this is Jen.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.902
- Helen's great-niece.
- Hi.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.393
- You must be the mailman.
- Yes.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.939
When he's not sitting there
most of the day.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.596
I like to make my own hours.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.932
I was gonna come
see you in a bit.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.111
I've got four months
of your aunt's mail.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.267
Thank you.

22:50.303 --> 22:53.237
Yeah, now,
more importantly, food.

22:53.306 --> 22:57.174
I will put my faith in David
and try the turkey club.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.177
Doug?

23:00.213 --> 23:03.080
Doug, sweetheart, this is Jen,
and she'd like a turkey club.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.115
Hello.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.183
A real family business, huh?

23:06.252 --> 23:08.586
He's just working here
while he studies for his boards.

23:08.688 --> 23:09.754
He's gonna be a doctor.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.269
- A dentist.
- A tooth doctor.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.659
Turkey club coming right up.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.165
Molly, did I order

23:21.200 --> 23:23.567
five or six dozen cinnamon rolls
for the kickoff party?

23:23.603 --> 23:25.102
I can't remember.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.938
Six, just like last year
and the year before that.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.274
Thank goodness. I woke up
in the middle of the night

23:30.343 --> 23:32.042
thinking I put in
the wrong order.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.889
How's the festival planning
going, Lana?

23:33.913 --> 23:35.713
What's the festival?

23:37.350 --> 23:40.351
The Chestnut Hill
Annual Christmas Festival.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.986
It's a week-long celebration,

23:42.021 --> 23:46.357
and it all starts tomorrow night
at the big kickoff party.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.058
We light up the whole town.

23:48.161 --> 23:49.560
Sounds like a lot of work.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.163
It is, but it's also
the most exciting time

23:52.198 --> 23:53.764
to be in Chestnut Hill.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.099
Here.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.269
You weren't kidding.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.905
Jen is Helen's niece.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.174
- Great-niece.
- Fantastic.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.120
Now that you're here,
you can decorate the inn.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.744
No, I don't really...

24:06.779 --> 24:11.048
Your aunt decorated that entire
inn, inside and out, every year.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.684
She would be heartbroken
if it was the only building

24:13.719 --> 24:15.719
on the street
not lit up for the festival.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.488
I wouldn't know where to start.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.023
Go from top to bottom.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.969
Start with lights,
end with the lawn ornaments.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.661
No, I meant I've never really
decorated for Christmas.

24:23.763 --> 24:27.164
I haven't celebrated that day
in a long time.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.467
Ooh, before I forget,
do you think you could run

24:29.569 --> 24:31.346
the gingerbread booth
tomorrow night?

24:31.370 --> 24:33.704
Gingerbread booth?

24:33.739 --> 24:36.340
That was always Helen's thing,
so you'll be great.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.620
I mean, how different can you
and your aunt really be, right?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.222
I can run the booth
for you, Lana.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.645
Don't be ridiculous, David.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.981
I need you at the photo booth,
taking photos.

24:44.016 --> 24:47.852
Lana, she just got here.
Let the girl breathe.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.387
No, no, I guess I can make
some time to help out.

24:50.456 --> 24:54.425
Perfect. Here is everything
you need to know.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.061
A map of the booths,
cookie diagrams,

24:57.096 --> 24:59.497
and a how-to
on the frosting gun.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.732
I will take care of
all the supplies.

25:01.767 --> 25:04.468
Just be there tomorrow, 6 p.m.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.071
Gotta dash. Love you all!

25:11.644 --> 25:13.978
David, you know that
nothing's going to happen

25:14.046 --> 25:16.680
unless you actually ask her
on a proper date.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.582
Yeah, I'm biding my time.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.684
I'm waiting
for the right moment.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.986
You can't rush love.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.605
Brian?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.280
Brian!

25:57.857 --> 25:59.156
Brian?

26:10.002 --> 26:13.370
Brian. Brian!

26:15.942 --> 26:16.974
You found my workshop.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.176
Yeah. Where are the elves?

26:19.211 --> 26:20.511
I gave them the week off.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.379
Something about
a prior commitment.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.816
So you weren't lying.
You really do build sleighs.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.052
- Yeah, yeah.
- Not too busy being a lawyer?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.954
That's the thing
about Chestnut Hill.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.256
Sometimes a job is just a job.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.058
At least you have a choice.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.993
You always have a choice.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.530
And just how is
the sleigh business anyway?

26:39.632 --> 26:41.352
Yeah, well, you know,
it depends.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.234
It still count as a business if
I haven't made money on it yet?

26:46.205 --> 26:50.341
Well, too bad because
you're actually really good.

26:52.712 --> 26:53.712
Thank you.

26:53.746 --> 26:56.180
I mean, come on.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.449
No wonder you're not
making any money.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.117
Look at these flyers.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.697
We don't exactly have
a marketing firm

27:01.721 --> 27:02.864
here in Chestnut Hill, you know.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.588
Clearly.

27:04.657 --> 27:08.258
You know,
I came by to drop this off.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.560
I read it cover to cover,

27:09.595 --> 27:11.662
signed where I was supposed to.

27:22.341 --> 27:26.210
Well, then... guess the inn
is officially yours.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.611
Congratulations.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.347
I own an inn.

27:30.383 --> 27:33.150
I never thought I'd say that.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.754
So how long you think
it'll take to get ready?

27:36.856 --> 27:37.788
To sell.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.890
Sell.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.358
Right.

27:41.394 --> 27:46.463
Well, hopefully only a few days.

27:46.565 --> 27:49.133
You know, I actually just got
roped into running

27:49.168 --> 27:51.869
something called
a "gingerbread booth"

27:51.904 --> 27:54.772
at the festival kickoff
tomorrow tonight.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.073
You met Lana!

27:56.108 --> 27:58.308
Indeed.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.210
Okay, well,
you might actually have fun.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.024
It's kind of a big deal
around here.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.547
I've noticed.

28:07.787 --> 28:10.587
Well, you know, I...
I gotta go.

28:10.690 --> 28:11.889
I got lots to do.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.958
Good luck with the giant sleigh.

28:15.061 --> 28:18.362
- It's for Santa.
- Of course it is.

28:18.431 --> 28:19.496
See you around.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.231
Bye.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.873
Hi!

28:29.909 --> 28:31.508
Oh, good. Hey.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.311
As promised,
four months' worth of mail.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.347
Helen always got more Christmas
cards than anyone in town.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.783
I didn't have the heart
to send them back after,

28:39.819 --> 28:41.385
you know.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.121
This place really meant
a lot to people, huh?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.423
This place? This inn's
one of the best things

28:46.459 --> 28:48.179
that ever happened
to Chestnut Hill.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.260
It gave a lot of people
a lot of joy.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.129
I'll put this somewhere safe.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.798
Great. You gonna come to
the big kickoff party tomorrow?

28:54.834 --> 28:56.467
I'll be there with bells on.

28:56.502 --> 28:57.568
Not literally.

28:57.603 --> 28:58.736
I'll see you there.

28:58.771 --> 28:59.703
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.371
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.816
<i>Eddie took me
to the Chestnut Hill</i>

29:45.851 --> 29:48.819
<i>Christmas Festival
kickoff party last night.</i>

29:48.888 --> 29:51.455
<i>Apparently the town throws
a big Christmas festival</i>

29:51.490 --> 29:53.157
<i>every year.</i>

29:53.259 --> 29:57.094
<i>I've heard Santa himself
shows up Christmas Eve.</i>

29:57.129 --> 29:59.530
<i>I've never had so much fun.</i>

29:59.565 --> 30:04.201
<i>The best part of the party was
the big lighting of downtown.</i>

30:04.236 --> 30:07.337
<i>Okay, I lied.
The best part of the party</i>

30:07.373 --> 30:09.807
<i>was when Eddie held up
some mistletoe</i>

30:09.909 --> 30:11.775
<i>and stole a kiss.</i>

30:16.182 --> 30:17.247
Hello?

30:17.316 --> 30:19.082
Hey, how's the wilderness?

30:19.118 --> 30:21.952
Actually, it's not that bad.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.720
Did you get the photos I sent?

30:23.823 --> 30:26.356
I did.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.436
But the commercial property guys
who I showed it to

30:28.460 --> 30:30.405
said that you're gonna need
better ones.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.596
What was wrong with them?

30:32.665 --> 30:35.532
Well, it's just the inn's
a little dated.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.901
You should see the town.

30:37.937 --> 30:41.104
Why don't you stage it?
Deck it out for Christmas.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.308
You of all people should know
how well Christmas sells.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.610
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.646
And, you know, maybe
hire a professional photographer

30:49.682 --> 30:50.914
while you're at it?

30:50.983 --> 30:52.716
<i>- Done.
- Don't worry.</i>

30:52.751 --> 30:56.019
We'll have this place
off your hands faster than...

30:56.055 --> 30:58.755
it takes Santa
to slide down the chimney.

30:58.791 --> 31:00.624
<i>Okay, you're trying
way too hard.</i>

31:00.659 --> 31:01.792
I know.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.527
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

31:14.940 --> 31:17.174
Good morning, Alaska.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.081
I'm coming, I'm coming!

31:31.290 --> 31:32.489
Hi, can I help you?

31:32.524 --> 31:33.790
Just checking in.

31:33.826 --> 31:36.360
- Checking in?
- Can we speak to Helen?

31:36.428 --> 31:38.262
She usually handles
our reservation.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.597
I am so sorry.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.367
Helen, she passed away
four months ago.

31:43.402 --> 31:47.537
That's terrible.
We had no idea.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.507
We've been coming here every
Christmas since the inn opened.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.877
Well, I'm Jen,
Helen's great-niece.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.412
Ruth! Henry!

31:55.514 --> 31:57.447
- Brian!
- Hello!

31:57.483 --> 31:59.216
Hi.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.984
We had no idea about Helen.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.819
I'm so sorry no one told you.

32:02.855 --> 32:07.157
Helen didn't really keep much
in the way of records.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.926
Sounds like Helen.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.561
I guess we'll have to
figure something else out.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.364
I sure hope we don't miss
the kickoff party tonight.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.501
We love when they
light up the town.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.870
You sure you're not
running the place?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.805
Jen run the place?

32:21.874 --> 32:23.740
She wouldn't know
how to do that.

32:23.776 --> 32:26.209
She's an advertising executive
from San Francisco.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.822
She's just here
to sell the place.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.780
Isn't that right, Jen?

32:32.184 --> 32:33.184
You know what?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.252
I have plenty of room.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.054
Of course you guys can stay.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.089
Are you sure?

32:38.190 --> 32:40.157
Yeah, yeah! Come on in.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.628
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.366
Do you have any rooms ready?

32:47.132 --> 32:49.299
We usually stay
in the Polar Bear Room.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.867
Best view of Main Street.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.769
Polar Bear Room it is.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.038
I hope it's not too much work
for you to set up.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.541
Not at all.
Besides, Brian's here.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.120
He can help me
get the room ready.

32:59.144 --> 33:02.279
In fact, he would love
to help you with those bags,

33:02.314 --> 33:05.182
while I get ready,
isn't that right?

33:09.955 --> 33:11.700
You know, I'm actually supposed
to be setting up the booths

33:11.724 --> 33:13.457
for the kickoff party tonight.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.193
Then you probably should be
making up this bed a bit faster.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.928
Yeah, yeah.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.530
Does this mean the inn
is officially back open?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.766
Well, I couldn't leave them
without a place to stay.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.002
What?

33:31.176 --> 33:34.611
Okay, I gotta get ready
for the big kickoff tonight.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.948
I will see you guys later.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.316
- Bye-bye.
- All right.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.918
We better go freshen up
for the party.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.654
Thank you so much, dear.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.290
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.263
What have I gotten myself into?

33:59.772 --> 34:01.938
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.789
You're gonna smile, okay?

34:18.824 --> 34:22.958
A lot of people in the town
really seem to go all out.

34:22.995 --> 34:25.728
Right? Look at our tree.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.697
It's a big tree there.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.933
- Come on, come on!
- Okay.

34:29.967 --> 34:33.036
Okay, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.138
How do you even make
a gingerbread man?

34:35.174 --> 34:36.751
It's easy.
Here's all the gingerbread,

34:36.775 --> 34:38.108
here's all the frosting,

34:38.210 --> 34:40.021
and here's all the candy
to decorate with.

34:40.045 --> 34:41.755
You just have to make sure
everything goes smoothly.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.181
You'll get the hang of it.
It's not that hard.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.583
No, no, wait, wait! I...

34:58.764 --> 35:01.465
Okay, here's the gingerbread,
and there's one right there.

35:03.735 --> 35:07.337
Yeah, and then just go ahead
and just, yeah, yeah.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.577
And this is the...

35:13.612 --> 35:15.412
Okay, yeah.

35:22.054 --> 35:24.521
Miss, can you help me?

35:24.656 --> 35:26.256
Yeah, sure.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.860
Look at your gingerbread man.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.428
He looks amazing.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.630
It's a gingerbread girl.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.632
Of course it is.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.400
All right.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.803
Got that?

35:39.838 --> 35:41.805
Yeah, it's tight.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
- Want me to give it a go?
- No, I got it.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.377
All right, fine.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.621
It's all right.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.734
I guess I can make her dress
a different color.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.358
No, no, no, absolutely not.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.527
Almost...
Almost got it.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.964
No.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.334
Looks like pink
just may be your color.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.540
Hey, at least I got it open.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.943
Okay.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.253
Not bad.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.023
Come on.
It's time for the main event.

36:38.931 --> 36:42.766
Gather round, folks,
we are about to light the town.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.704
Welcome, everyone,
to the official

36:47.773 --> 36:51.508
Chestnut Hill Christmas Festival
Kickoff Party!

36:53.111 --> 36:54.989
Really got into the spirit
this year, huh?

36:55.013 --> 36:56.346
Shut up.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.515
This festival has been
a tradition in our town

36:58.550 --> 37:00.650
for over a hundred years,

37:00.719 --> 37:04.087
and I am honored
and a bit overwhelmed

37:04.122 --> 37:05.855
to be this year's chair.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.191
The festival started
as a way for us

37:08.293 --> 37:09.737
to really appreciate Christmas,

37:09.761 --> 37:13.597
not just for one day,
but for an entire week.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.132
It's important for us
to slow down

37:16.201 --> 37:18.335
and to be grateful
for all that we have.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.704
One woman who embodied

37:20.772 --> 37:22.973
everything
this festival stands for

37:23.041 --> 37:26.109
and everything
Christmas represents

37:26.144 --> 37:27.677
was Helen Taylor.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.350
We will all miss her dearly.

37:33.385 --> 37:37.887
But it is an honor to have
her niece, Jen Taylor,

37:37.923 --> 37:41.157
join us all the way
from San Francisco.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.027
Great-niece.

37:44.062 --> 37:48.198
Jen, would you do the honors
of officially kicking off

37:48.267 --> 37:53.303
the 115th Chestnut Hill
Christmas Festival?

37:54.273 --> 37:55.473
- Oh, my...
- Yes!

37:56.475 --> 37:58.074
Are you sure?

37:58.110 --> 37:59.776
Yes! Get up here!

38:05.250 --> 38:07.484
Everyone...

38:07.519 --> 38:10.453
10, 9, 8...

38:10.555 --> 38:13.857
7, 6, 5, 4...

38:13.959 --> 38:16.493
3, 2, 1.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.698
Christmas pics.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.967
I saw you working
the photo booth last night.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.869
Everyone around here
wears a lot of hats.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.706
So let's say I decided to
decorate the inn for Christmas.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.075
That's great!

39:05.110 --> 39:08.011
Lana was afraid that you
weren't gonna participate.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.747
The open house.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.248
- Open house.
- Yeah.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.950
Right.

39:13.985 --> 39:18.555
So anyways, assuming
I decorate for the open house,

39:18.657 --> 39:22.025
I was wondering if you can take
professional photos of it?

39:23.962 --> 39:25.028
I'd love to, yeah.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.996
Thanks.

39:27.065 --> 39:31.000
So what's the story
with you and Lana anyway?

39:31.103 --> 39:32.569
Lana? She's my friend.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.372
I saw the way you looked at her
last night.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.407
What are you waiting for?

39:37.442 --> 39:39.843
Well, look, I know she just
got out of a relationship,

39:39.878 --> 39:41.456
and I just wanted
to give her some time

39:41.480 --> 39:43.546
before she jumps into
something new.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.348
That was five years ago.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.616
I drop hints.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.286
Hey, Molly, have you seen Brian?

39:50.322 --> 39:52.266
I was hoping he would know where
my aunt kept her decorations.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.157
He's at the candy cane toss.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.259
Of course he is.

40:07.672 --> 40:11.141
Hey, Jen, there are
still a few slots left.

40:11.209 --> 40:14.711
I have no idea
what a candy cane toss is.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.279
It's easy. All you have to do

40:16.381 --> 40:18.782
is throw those hoops
over the giant candy canes.

40:18.817 --> 40:22.519
Whoever has the best score
at the end wins the grand prize.

40:22.554 --> 40:26.022
I don't want to brag, but I have
won ten years in a row.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.758
I was captain of the badminton
team in high school.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.527
I don't think
those skills apply.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.073
I think you're just nervous
I might win.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.597
- You wanna make it interesting?
- Like a bet?

40:34.666 --> 40:37.467
If I win, you have to help me
paint Santa's sleigh.

40:37.536 --> 40:38.802
And if I win?

40:38.837 --> 40:40.236
Your pick.

40:40.338 --> 40:42.238
You have to help me
decorate the inn

40:42.274 --> 40:43.940
for open house night.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.743
- Deal.
- Deal.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.781
You almost got it.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.751
So the candy canes in the back
are worth more,

40:54.786 --> 40:56.352
but they're harder to hit.

40:56.388 --> 40:59.322
Everyone gets three rounds
of three hoops.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.636
The person at the end of the
game with the most points wins.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.326
Usually me.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.328
Not this year.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.731
Good luck.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.206
Beginner's luck.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.141
Someone's worried.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.614
Yeah!

41:46.972 --> 41:48.638
What do you know about that?

41:56.214 --> 41:57.814
So this is Jen's last hoop.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.149
She makes this, we tie.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.652
Go, Jen.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.121
What? You've won
enough times already.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.529
For the first time
in festival history,

42:12.564 --> 42:14.597
we have a tie.

42:14.633 --> 42:18.234
Brian Anderson and Jen Taylor.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.470
A job very well done.

42:22.374 --> 42:24.240
Well, that was impressive.

42:24.309 --> 42:28.311
So who wins the bet?
Or is it off?

42:28.380 --> 42:30.191
Oh, no. You are helping me
paint that sleigh.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.916
Good. You're helping me
decorate.

42:32.951 --> 42:36.119
- Fine.
- Fine.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.457
No!

42:41.493 --> 42:42.692
A pipe must have burst.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.060
I needed those decorations.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.429
Maybe there's something
we can salvage.

42:46.464 --> 42:49.032
I have a better idea.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.267
All right, so a while back,

42:51.303 --> 42:54.370
I did a campaign for
a company called Balsam Hill.

42:54.406 --> 42:55.805
It's an online store

42:55.874 --> 42:58.308
that sells all kinds of
Christmas decorations,

42:58.343 --> 43:02.011
from garlands to wreaths
to lights to ornaments to trees.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.613
- Fake trees?
- No, no, no.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.226
I've seen them,
and they are gorgeous.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.784
You'll keep forgetting
it's not real.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.986
They will have
everything we need

43:10.088 --> 43:13.222
to make the open house
really special.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.692
All right.
Don't worry, Irene.

43:15.760 --> 43:20.396
You will have the best
Christmas photos ever.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.445
Yeah, yeah.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.019
Great.

43:43.088 --> 43:46.356
Well, why not just use
last year's sleigh?

43:46.391 --> 43:49.559
Let's just say last year
Lana thought it'd be a good idea

43:49.594 --> 43:52.295
to use real reindeer
to pull the sleigh.

43:52.330 --> 43:53.896
The reindeer, they were fine.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.131
They went their own way,

43:55.233 --> 43:58.368
the sleigh went another.

44:01.373 --> 44:02.572
Hey, hold on, hold on.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.251
You gotta slow down.
You're rushing.

44:04.275 --> 44:07.477
- Okay.
- Relax.

44:07.512 --> 44:10.613
Yeah, there you go.
Back and forth.

44:10.715 --> 44:13.216
Nice and easy.

44:13.318 --> 44:16.719
Back and forth.

44:16.755 --> 44:18.354
Yeah, see?
That's not so bad, is it?

44:18.390 --> 44:21.090
No, no, it's not.

44:21.126 --> 44:22.258
You got it.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.929
Hope he's not
working you too hard.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.965
No, no, not at all.

44:29.034 --> 44:30.933
I'm gonna grab
some more of that paint.

44:32.437 --> 44:36.305
I brought you these
for the inn's open house.

44:36.341 --> 44:40.109
Thank you so much.
Now all I need are decorations.

44:40.145 --> 44:42.745
So how do you like
Chestnut Hill so far?

44:42.781 --> 44:46.582
Would you believe I haven't had
this much fun in a long time?

44:46.651 --> 44:49.052
Actually I can.

45:04.469 --> 45:07.904
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

45:46.344 --> 45:47.443
<i>Come on!</i>

46:00.125 --> 46:02.558
What do you think?
Is that crooked?

46:02.660 --> 46:05.161
Maybe to the left?

46:05.196 --> 46:07.396
To the right.

46:07.499 --> 46:08.698
Perfect.

46:10.835 --> 46:12.713
You know, I think you've got
more Christmas spirit

46:12.737 --> 46:14.137
than you let on.

46:14.172 --> 46:16.105
You think so?

46:16.141 --> 46:19.142
I hope whoever buys this place
keeps it just the way it is.

46:19.177 --> 46:20.921
Your aunt opened it
when I was little.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.723
It's practically
a Chestnut Hill landmark.

46:22.747 --> 46:25.782
Do you think she would've tried
to find someone to take it over?

46:25.817 --> 46:27.850
Maybe she was hoping you would.

46:30.555 --> 46:33.055
I gotta ask. What's up with
you and Christmas anyway?

46:33.091 --> 46:35.424
There is nothing between
me and Christmas.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.460
I'm just busy.

46:38.096 --> 46:40.329
Look, when I was growing up,

46:40.365 --> 46:43.499
my parents and I celebrated
like everyone else.

46:43.601 --> 46:47.003
But when I got a job,
and I moved into the city,

46:47.038 --> 46:50.540
since it was just me,
there was no point.

46:50.575 --> 46:54.210
So it was a reminder
that you're alone.

46:54.245 --> 46:57.113
No, no, not at all.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.715
It's just...

47:02.020 --> 47:04.287
It's a lot when...

47:04.322 --> 47:06.589
When you're alone?

47:08.293 --> 47:12.995
So what's your story,
Mr. Lawyer-slash-sleigh maker?

47:13.031 --> 47:15.164
What's to tell?

47:15.266 --> 47:17.099
My dad had
a small practice here,

47:17.235 --> 47:20.603
and then I took it over.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.371
You never thought about leaving?

47:24.042 --> 47:25.741
I belong here.

47:25.810 --> 47:29.245
Question is...
where do you belong?

47:30.548 --> 47:32.415
So...

47:32.450 --> 47:33.482
We gotta get ready.

47:34.686 --> 47:37.186
The open house.

47:37.255 --> 47:40.623
Hi! Merry Christmas!
Good to see you.

47:40.658 --> 47:42.758
Hi! Merry Christmas!

47:42.794 --> 47:45.361
Hi! Welcome, welcome!

47:58.776 --> 48:00.009
Hot, hot, hot chocolate.

48:01.179 --> 48:03.379
Awesome.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.215
Hey.

48:06.251 --> 48:07.316
Nice. Please hold.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.952
Look here. Okay.

48:09.988 --> 48:11.320
That's great.

48:11.389 --> 48:13.656
- Hey, Lana.
- Did you get one of us?

48:13.691 --> 48:15.691
That's great!

48:15.727 --> 48:17.193
Gentlemen.

48:19.197 --> 48:22.698
I can't believe
how great this place looks.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.901
Yup, Jen, it's better than ever.

48:24.969 --> 48:27.136
Helen would be so happy.

48:27.205 --> 48:29.872
Well, I just really wanted
to do this place justice.

48:29.908 --> 48:33.009
Judging by Lana's reaction,
I'd say you succeeded.

48:33.044 --> 48:34.977
Well, go talk to her.

48:35.013 --> 48:36.879
I'm on the clock.

48:43.888 --> 48:45.608
Would the lady
care for some refreshment?

48:45.657 --> 48:49.125
This looks great.
What kind of mix is this?

48:49.227 --> 48:50.192
It's not a mix.

48:50.228 --> 48:51.694
That's real melted chocolate.

48:51.729 --> 48:53.696
I could get used to this.

48:53.765 --> 48:56.966
And the craziest part is,
it's not even that hard to make.

48:58.770 --> 49:00.503
Thank you so much for tonight.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.016
And tell your mom thank you too.

49:02.040 --> 49:05.274
I mean, these cinnamon rolls
are a big hit.

49:05.310 --> 49:09.111
I'm just glad to see everyone
admiring your work.

49:10.315 --> 49:11.514
Our work.

49:17.722 --> 49:19.055
Thank you for coming.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.895
All right, here are
your photos as promised.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.863
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

49:27.899 --> 49:29.009
So what do you
need 'em for anyway?

49:29.033 --> 49:30.900
Your family?

49:30.935 --> 49:32.234
Family, right.

49:32.270 --> 49:33.669
Okay, good.

49:33.705 --> 49:36.639
Well, good night, Jen.
Thanks for asking me.

49:36.674 --> 49:38.708
- No problem.
- Yeah.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.643
It was a lot of fun.

49:40.678 --> 49:42.378
Bye. Thank you.

50:54.485 --> 50:57.286
<i>Yesterday I was supposed
to get on a flight</i>

50:57.321 --> 50:59.555
<i>and continue with my travels.</i>

50:59.590 --> 51:02.458
<i>I was all packed
and ready to leave,</i>

51:02.493 --> 51:05.661
<i>and Eddie came and said goodbye.</i>

51:05.763 --> 51:07.630
<i>When I got to the airport,</i>

51:07.698 --> 51:11.634
<i>I realized for the first time
in a long time</i>

51:11.702 --> 51:15.538
<i>I didn't want to choose
a new adventure.</i>

51:15.606 --> 51:19.608
<i>I wanted to continue the one
I had already started.</i>

51:19.644 --> 51:23.379
<i>The look on Eddie's face when
I walked back into that cafe,</i>

51:23.414 --> 51:28.284
<i>that was...
that was everything.</i>

51:28.352 --> 51:31.087
<i>I knew I had made
the right choice.</i>

51:31.122 --> 51:33.823
<i>I didn't want to leave
Chestnut Hill.</i>

51:46.704 --> 51:48.304
<i>Hey! Hey, honey!</i>

51:48.339 --> 51:49.972
Hi, sweetheart!

51:50.041 --> 51:53.409
<i>Hi, guys. So are you
getting ready to sail out?</i>

51:53.478 --> 51:55.422
<i>Well, we just wanted to see
how Alaska's treating you.</i>

51:55.446 --> 51:59.415
Actually, I'm having
a great time.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.584
Aunt Helen, she really
put a lot into the inn,

52:01.619 --> 52:05.721
and I'm sorry we never visited
her while she was still here.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.690
There never was a right time.

52:07.725 --> 52:10.025
No. I should have made
more time.

52:10.128 --> 52:11.327
<i>I know the feeling.</i>

52:11.429 --> 52:13.462
Do you think selling the inn

52:13.498 --> 52:15.397
is the right thing to do?

52:15.433 --> 52:17.333
I honestly don't know, honey.

52:17.401 --> 52:20.436
What, are you having
second thoughts?

52:20.471 --> 52:22.505
No, no. I don't know.

52:22.573 --> 52:25.074
It's not like I can run the inn
from San Francisco.

52:25.143 --> 52:28.310
I just wish I knew
the right thing to do.

52:28.379 --> 52:31.080
Well, maybe there is
no right thing to do.

52:31.149 --> 52:34.984
Maybe the thing is to figure out
what you want the most.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.386
<i>What was that?</i>

52:37.421 --> 52:38.487
What was what?

52:42.460 --> 52:44.727
Mom, I gotta go.

52:44.762 --> 52:48.631
There's some crazy man
throwing snowballs at my window.

52:48.666 --> 52:49.932
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

52:49.967 --> 52:52.301
I'll call you later.
I love you. Bye.

52:56.073 --> 52:59.775
You do know I have a phone
and a doorbell.

52:59.810 --> 53:01.388
Yeah, but where's the fun
in that?

53:01.412 --> 53:03.279
What are you doing here?

53:03.347 --> 53:04.958
I want to show you something.
Are you free?

53:04.982 --> 53:07.316
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.851
Okay, sure, I'll be down.

53:08.886 --> 53:10.386
Okay. Dress warm.

54:14.986 --> 54:17.052
This is incredible.

54:17.088 --> 54:20.389
I've seen it in the movies,
I've read about it in books,

54:20.458 --> 54:23.392
but in person,
it's otherworldly.

54:24.395 --> 54:26.295
Yeah.

54:26.330 --> 54:30.432
Definitely can't get this
in San Francisco.

54:30.501 --> 54:32.401
How are those colors
even possible?

54:34.538 --> 54:37.940
The Inuit believed those colors

54:37.975 --> 54:39.541
are the spirits of those

54:39.577 --> 54:43.345
who lived the most worthy
and full lives.

54:43.414 --> 54:47.049
Those who loved with all
their hearts and lived with...

54:47.151 --> 54:48.517
endless passion.

54:50.421 --> 54:53.122
When they get to heaven,

54:53.157 --> 54:56.859
they become torches of light...

54:56.894 --> 55:00.362
meant to guide every one of us
left behind,

55:00.431 --> 55:04.900
reminding us to live
our best lives.

55:04.969 --> 55:07.503
What about you?
Have you lived the fullest,

55:07.538 --> 55:10.973
most passionate life?

55:11.008 --> 55:12.308
I'm getting there.

55:12.410 --> 55:14.576
What about you?

55:16.781 --> 55:18.714
Well, it depends.

55:18.749 --> 55:22.985
If it means working really hard
and gaining a successful career,

55:23.087 --> 55:24.453
then yeah.

55:24.522 --> 55:27.523
But what if success
isn't about your career?

55:27.591 --> 55:32.061
What if it's finding happiness
in the little things?

55:32.129 --> 55:35.197
Stopping to smell the roses
or stopping to...

55:35.232 --> 55:38.067
stare up at the sky.

55:40.271 --> 55:42.304
Then I guess I'm still
getting there too.

55:45.209 --> 55:47.910
Thank you.

55:47.978 --> 55:49.545
For everything.

56:52.109 --> 56:53.409
Hello?

56:53.444 --> 56:55.377
<i>- Ms. Taylor.
- Hi, yes, this is she.</i>

56:55.479 --> 56:58.080
Hi there. Russell Nixon,
CEO of Nixon Hotels.

56:58.115 --> 56:59.559
<i>I'm sorry to be calling so late,</i>

56:59.583 --> 57:01.094
<i>but I was really excited
to talk to you.</i>

57:01.118 --> 57:03.096
I was given your information
through a mutual contact

57:03.120 --> 57:04.698
in regards to the property
that you're selling

57:04.722 --> 57:06.121
in Chestnut Hill, Alaska.

57:06.157 --> 57:09.658
Irene's fast.

57:09.727 --> 57:12.661
Yes, I am selling
my Aunt Helen's inn.

57:12.696 --> 57:14.074
That's what I hear.
That's great.

57:14.098 --> 57:15.998
I wanna let you know
that I actually own

57:16.033 --> 57:18.000
a handful of hotels in Alaska,

57:18.035 --> 57:21.036
<i>and I've had my eye on your inn
for quite some time.</i>

57:21.071 --> 57:22.471
<i>I would love to make an offer,</i>

57:22.506 --> 57:24.673
and I would be willing
to pay cash.

57:27.812 --> 57:29.678
You still there?

57:32.049 --> 57:35.551
Yes. It's just all
happening so fast.

57:35.586 --> 57:37.853
I understand completely.
Tell you what.

57:37.888 --> 57:39.800
How about I tell you
a little bit about our company

57:39.824 --> 57:41.423
and my visions for the inn?

57:41.459 --> 57:44.193
Of course.

57:44.228 --> 57:47.129
It's just, actually,
now is not a good time.

57:47.231 --> 57:48.864
No worries.
No worries at all.

57:48.899 --> 57:51.233
Tell you what. I'll call you
again tomorrow, okay?

57:51.268 --> 57:53.836
Perfect. Thank you.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.752
Well, you're in
an awfully good mood.

58:10.821 --> 58:12.588
This wouldn't have
anything to do

58:12.656 --> 58:14.067
with Helen's great-niece,
would it?

58:14.091 --> 58:16.158
Can't I just be excited

58:16.193 --> 58:17.993
for the town
gift exchange tonight?

58:18.028 --> 58:20.629
I have never seen you act this
way for the festival before.

58:20.698 --> 58:23.432
I'm with Mom.
I think it's because of her.

58:23.467 --> 58:25.278
- Who are we talking about?
- Jen.

58:25.302 --> 58:28.704
Right.
Yeah, Brian's totally in love.

58:28.806 --> 58:31.039
I am not in love.

58:31.075 --> 58:33.575
Okay, fine. It's been nice
having her around.

58:33.644 --> 58:36.612
And it turns out she's actually
really fun and smart

58:36.647 --> 58:38.547
and amazing and beautiful.

58:38.582 --> 58:42.217
Brian, why don't you tell her
how you feel?

58:42.253 --> 58:44.553
Why? What's the point?
She's never gonna stay.

58:44.588 --> 58:47.589
She's a big-city girl
with big-city dreams.

58:47.625 --> 58:50.926
You know, there once was a time
I thought I'd never leave Miami.

58:50.961 --> 58:54.096
- Are you sorry you did?
- Not at all.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.932
'Cause this town has the most
important thing in the world.

58:56.967 --> 58:58.734
Yeah, yeah.

58:58.769 --> 59:00.614
But you guys dated for years
before Doug finally came around.

59:00.638 --> 59:02.237
That's different.

59:02.306 --> 59:03.884
I've known her for, what,
a little over a week?

59:03.908 --> 59:06.141
Brian, I love you,

59:06.176 --> 59:09.578
but you can be stubbornly
closed-minded sometimes.

59:09.613 --> 59:12.481
Tell her how you feel.
You never know.

59:12.516 --> 59:15.384
People can surprise you.

59:15.419 --> 59:17.586
I have to get to work.

59:17.655 --> 59:19.165
I love you all.
You're all crazy.

59:19.189 --> 59:20.989
Thanks for the coffee, Mom.

59:21.058 --> 59:23.792
Then maybe you need to be
a little crazy too.

59:23.827 --> 59:26.194
Yeah.

59:26.230 --> 59:28.797
I wish your brother would give
himself permission to be happy.

59:28.832 --> 59:30.265
He'll come around.

59:30.301 --> 59:33.302
Have you seen the way
he looks at her?

59:33.370 --> 59:35.737
Have you seen the way
that she looks at him?

59:47.585 --> 59:49.318
Ellis, hi.

59:49.386 --> 59:53.288
I hope you're getting a little
R&R up there in Alaska.

59:53.324 --> 59:56.625
<i>- Actually, I am.
- That's good to hear.</i>

59:56.660 --> 59:59.428
I was wondering

59:59.463 --> 01:00:02.431
if you still plan on
being back by Christmas.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:07.269
You know, I don't know.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:11.607
Jen, the board and I
would like to offer you

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:14.676
the position
of creative director.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.845
Wait.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.580
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.782
We have done a thorough review
of your work,

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:24.119
and you've really outdone
yourself on every campaign.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.021
Well, what about Karen?

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.389
<i>What about Karen?</i>

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:31.560
She's a great executive,
but, Jen...

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:33.095
you've got heart.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.697
I do?

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.899
I don't know what to say.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.801
<i>Say yes.</i>

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:42.738
Yes, of course, of course.
Thank you.

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:44.973
Great. We'll make
the announcement

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.475
at the Christmas party tomorrow.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:49.945
<i>- Tomorrow?
- Yes!</i>

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:53.949
You can do that, can't you?
After all,

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.551
you are the new creative
director of the company.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.522
Yeah, I'll tell Diane
to book a flight right away.

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:01.523
<i>Wonderful.</i>

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:04.826
And, Jen, congratulations.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.862
You've earned this.

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.764
<i>I'll see you tomorrow?</i>

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.032
See you then.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.873
Don't forget to pick up a number

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:33.388
as soon as you
set your gift down.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.823
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.925
I have a gift.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.194
Just put it under the tree
with the rest.

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.129
No, it's, it's for you.

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:43.131
For me?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.001
Here. Open it.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.205
A menu?

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:54.187
It's what I want to cook
if you'll have dinner with me.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.744
I'd love to.

01:01:56.847 --> 01:01:58.113
You would?

01:01:58.148 --> 01:01:59.592
I've been waiting for you
to ask.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:02.084
How about Christmas dinner?

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:04.753
That sounds like a plan.

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:07.422
Sounds like a date.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:11.626
Hey! Stay behind
the designated cones!

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:13.829
Yeah!

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.371
How great is this?

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:29.511
I think it's safe to say that
I've never seen a Christmas tree

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:32.180
with that many presents
under it.

01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:38.186
You actually
brought a gift, huh?

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:42.057
I did, and it's not
for the exchange.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.258
It's for you.

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:46.094
For me?

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.063
Open it.

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.240
Jen, this is...

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:00.642
This is good.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:02.077
Thank you.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:03.945
No, this is like
really, really good.

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.882
Like, "Why aren't you doing more
of these all the time" good.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:09.751
I've always wanted
to be an artist,

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:13.588
but when I got older,
it just felt less practical.

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:15.535
I went into advertising
because I thought

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.659
it was a way I could
make money with art.

01:03:17.728 --> 01:03:21.363
But I really do miss drawing
just for the fun of it.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:23.298
Thank you.

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:30.772
Brian, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.240
Yeah, anything.

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:35.443
Jen, I've been
wanting to find out

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.612
where you got that garland
you had at the inn.

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:40.515
It would look great for
the Valentine's Day festival.

01:03:40.551 --> 01:03:42.417
Balsam Hill.
It's an online store.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:45.387
Guess I'll have
to plug in my dial-up.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.824
Excuse me.
I gotta call the next number.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.196
Sorry. You wanted
to tell me something?

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:57.399
- Yeah. Can we take a walk?
- Sure.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.373
So what's up?

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.209
I wanted to thank you.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.779
You have done so much for me,

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:13.026
and I don't think I could ever
thank you properly.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.916
It's been my pleasure.

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:16.585
But...

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.454
I have to go back tonight.

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.423
What do you mean?

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:26.027
Well, I got offered a promotion.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:29.664
A promotion?

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.433
Yeah.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.870
Brian, this...

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:37.906
all of this has been
so wonderful,

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.808
but I have to get back to work.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.711
And this promotion is
a huge step for me,

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:46.114
and it's something
I've worked towards.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.583
Just like that?
What about the inn?

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:50.352
Well, there is
this hotel company

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.287
that's interested
in acquiring it.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:54.022
So you are selling it.

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:56.625
Look, I know everybody wants me
to stay and run the place,

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.093
but it's not me.

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:01.329
Just like you said
you knew you belonged here,

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:03.031
I belong there.

01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:07.035
Well, congratulations.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.771
You got what you wanted.
I'm happy for you.

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:11.373
I wanted to tell you first.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:16.544
What time's your flight?
I'll take you to the airport.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.224
Brian, you don't have
to do that.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.881
It's late.
I'll call a cab.

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:23.351
Just when I thought you were
starting to get this town.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:27.055
There aren't any taxis here,
are there?

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.890
Not so much.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.314
<i>We did it.
Eddie and I just finished</i>

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:55.016
<i>converting the old house
into an inn.</i>

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:57.285
<i>Our grand opening is tomorrow.</i>

01:05:57.321 --> 01:06:01.356
<i>Everybody in town has been
so supportive and helpful.</i>

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.793
<i>I'm so glad that now
people from all over</i>

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:10.165
<i>can come and experience
the magic of Chestnut Hill.</i>

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:20.675
Thank you.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.411
Thanks.

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:28.683
I'm so glad
we got a chance to meet.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:31.052
Thank you so much
for everything.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.054
Of course, of course.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.390
Kick butt at your job.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.591
I will.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:39.194
If you ever need a dentist...

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:40.395
Have a great trip.

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:41.763
Bye. Thank you.

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:43.531
Safe travels.

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:18.266
Well...

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:20.702
Where we first met.

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:22.771
Where you first insulted me.

01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:24.639
I was an idiot.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:27.575
Good luck.

01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:29.277
With everything.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.013
You too.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.719
Do you think
if things were different,

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:40.822
if we lived in the same place

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:42.857
that this, that you and I,

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:46.594
we could've,
could've been something?

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:48.029
I do.

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.801
I thought asking that
was gonna make me feel better.

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:54.002
It didn't.

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:01.576
Bye, Brian.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:06.948
Bye.

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:26.234
Bye.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.345
Jen!

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:41.416
It was so weird
not having you here.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.350
It's... great to be back.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.520
Don't look.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.956
You looked.

01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:49.491
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:51.826
You said don't look,
so I wanted to see.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.595
She's coming, isn't she?

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.863
Jen!

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.096
Karen!

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.099
How was Alaska?

01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.667
It was... great.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.237
I just want to say
congratulations.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.272
You know, on the big promotion.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.640
You heard?

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:07.175
You deserve it.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:09.144
I do?

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:12.881
I mean, I am transferring over
to Parker-McKenzie.

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:15.884
Otherwise, the position
would've totally been mine.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.189
Jennifer Taylor's office.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:23.158
Can you hold for a moment?

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:25.493
Russell Nixon
on the line for you.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.795
I'll take it in my office.

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:33.835
This is Jen.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:36.171
Ms. Taylor.
Russell Nixon.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.073
Yes, I am so sorry.

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:41.643
I meant to return
your call earlier.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:44.612
No, I completely understand.
Look, it's the holidays.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.214
<i>Things get a bit crazy.</i>

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:48.515
<i>I was hoping we could talk more
about my offer.</i>

01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:52.287
Yes. Actually,
I am back in San Francisco.

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:53.654
Great.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.957
Then we can chat in person then.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:59.294
How does this evening work so
that we can talk about the sale?

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:02.430
<i>Perhaps someplace
close to your office.</i>

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:06.434
Well, this afternoon is
the office Christmas party,

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:10.238
<i>and I have to leave early,
but there is this restaurant</i>

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:12.185
next to my apartment building
that'll work.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:14.242
Name the spot.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:19.747
Here, eat something.

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:21.583
Moping's not a good look on you.

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:25.520
What was I supposed to do, Mom?

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:28.089
Say, "Hey, I think I'm
completely in love with you,

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:30.825
even though we've only known
each other a week.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.405
Please leave your life behind
and move to Alaska

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:33.429
to be with me"?

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:35.730
Well, maybe not in those words.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:37.732
But look at Beth and Doug.

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.667
It's not the most
far-fetched idea.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:40.935
That's different.

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:46.307
You know, when I took this place
over from your grandparents,

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:49.077
I had this great job offer
in New York.

01:10:51.181 --> 01:10:52.981
- You never told me that.
- Yeah.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:56.985
But I'd started dating your dad,
and, well, you know how he was.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.287
Hometown boy
through and through.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:00.566
- That's Dad.
- Yeah.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.590
But you know what he did?

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.026
He made a list
of all the law firms

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.829
that he could apply to
in New York.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:11.099
And that's when I realized what
he was willing to sacrifice

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:13.268
to be with me.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.536
And it was right then
that I knew

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:18.973
I wanted to stay here
and marry him.

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:26.014
Jen gave me this
to give to David,

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:29.150
to have the inn's mail
forwarded.

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:38.693
Show her you're willing
to make a sacrifice.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:41.829
Thank you, Mom.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:45.199
I love you.

01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:46.868
I love you too.

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:04.986
Now, we've got the
Anderson account quarter three.

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:08.122
See if Peter can give you
the numbers from last year.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:10.858
He may even have
some other ideas.

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:12.827
That sound good with you, Jen?

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.229
Great. Totally on board.

01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:16.664
Okay.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.267
Let me get you that file.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:21.903
You'll have these numbers ready
for me by tomorrow morning.

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:25.540
One of my clients sent us all
fresh-baked gingerbread cookies.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:29.310
- You want one?
- Pink one.

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:31.913
They call this
a gingerbread man?

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:34.182
Least they could've done
was put some buttons on him,

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:36.551
maybe a hat.

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:47.995
I've gotta go.

01:12:48.098 --> 01:12:49.564
I have a meeting.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:52.200
- A meeting?
- Yeah, I'll call you later.

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:55.002
You will be at the party
this afternoon

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:56.038
for the big announcement?

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:57.772
Big announcement, right.

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:11.219
As you can see,
we have these resorts

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:13.621
all over Alaska
and parts of Canada.

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.590
People just love
the stunning landscape

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:16.924
of those majestic mountains,

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.193
so we provide
a luxury experience,

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:22.196
while still appreciating
the nature around them.

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:24.332
- These buildings are huge.
- Yes.

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:26.601
We're acquiring some
empty adjacent lots as well.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:28.247
I thought you wanted
to take over the inn,

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:30.438
not build a hotel.

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:33.508
Some of the original structure
of the inn will remain intact,

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:35.510
but we will need
to tear down some of it

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:38.413
in order for us to reach
the property's full potential.

01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:39.847
Full potential?

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:42.016
We're building
a destination here.

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:43.418
Think about it.

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:45.219
Vail. Aspen.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:46.788
Chestnut Hill.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:49.991
We're catering
to an exclusive clientele.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:51.637
We're gonna offer
concierge service,

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.227
first-class spa, fine dining.

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:55.496
Okay, well, what about
the mom-and-pop restaurants,

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:57.498
like Molly's, the town's cafe?

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.145
Won't that put them
out of business?

01:13:59.169 --> 01:14:01.669
People can still get their
grilled cheese and tomato soup.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:02.982
They'll just have to go
somewhere else.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:05.540
Well, their turkey club
is pretty good.

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:08.476
We're gonna make
Chestnut Hill special.

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:10.645
It's already special.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:18.553
Thank you. Thanks.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.211
Okay, I can assure you

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:45.458
that you're not gonna get a
higher offer from anyone else.

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.849
But it's not about the money.

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:49.150
It's about the town.

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:50.751
People in the town.

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:53.855
The inn, my inn,
it's not just about the profit.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.523
It never was.

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:57.992
It's about a place where
people go to and slow down,

01:14:58.094 --> 01:15:01.095
to finally enjoy
what life has to offer.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.441
I couldn't agree with you more,
which is exactly

01:15:02.465 --> 01:15:04.198
why we want to put
the resort in.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:07.435
Okay, but these tall buildings
that block a mountain view?

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.003
An entertainment center?

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:11.005
That's not why people
come to Chestnut Hill.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.274
They come for something unique.

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:14.809
Listen, Ms. Taylor, I think...

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:17.778
No, you listen, Mr. Nixon.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:20.448
Jen?

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:21.517
Brian?

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:25.319
What... How...

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:27.989
I'm so sorry I didn't call.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:31.025
I didn't know that
you were gonna be on a date.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.094
I just...
I had to come see you.

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:35.029
There's something
I have to say to you.

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:38.132
Buddy, this isn't a date.
This is a business meeting.

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:41.369
A business meeting
that just ended.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.508
The inn is no longer for sale.

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:52.113
Great.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:55.116
Wait, are you really
not selling the inn?

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:58.252
Yes. Wait, wait.
What did you come to tell me?

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.254
I still can't believe
you're here.

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:02.557
I came to tell you that...

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.492
I'm falling for you.

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:06.805
I've been falling ever since
you first stepped off the plane.

01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:09.241
And I know that this is fast,
and it's sudden, and it's crazy,

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.499
but I think that if you
feel at all the same way,

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:13.234
we should see where this goes.

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:16.070
I'm sure they're always looking
for more attorneys here,

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:18.105
and I bet I could really
get a leg up

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:20.308
on the sleigh-making market
here too.

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:23.644
I have never felt
this way before.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.780
I don't wanna lose you.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:27.915
I know how much your career
means to you

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.383
and how hard you've worked,

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:32.553
and I would never ask you
to give that up.

01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:34.355
You know what?

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:38.626
I am done with selling
the idea of living.

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:40.695
I'm actually ready to live it.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:42.763
I want to go back
to Chestnut Hill.

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:44.098
What?

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:45.633
Yes, yes!

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:49.537
I can run the inn,
you know, just like Helen did.

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:51.872
Maybe start a small
marketing firm

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.385
for the Chestnut Hill
businesses.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.444
You know, since everyone there
wears many hats.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:59.680
And you know, if we caught
the next flight out,

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:03.351
we can get back in town just
in time to see Santa arrive.

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:06.721
There's just one thing
I need to do first.

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:25.272
Oh, Jen, there you are!

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:26.852
We're about to announce
your promotion.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.609
You mean Karen's promotion.

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:30.255
- I told you that...
- You don't need to transfer.

01:17:30.279 --> 01:17:31.979
- Stay here.
- But...

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.582
I've given everything
to this job.

01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:37.118
Literally everything.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:41.856
My entire adult life has been
about succeeding here,

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:44.759
creating ad campaigns
to get people to think

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:49.630
that their lives would get
better just buying something.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:52.900
I thought that
that's what I wanted,

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:58.005
until I got a taste of what
actually makes life better.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:17:59.807
I found out that it's about

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:01.942
appreciating the people
in your life,

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:05.379
spending time with people
who make you laugh,

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:08.082
and experiencing the little
things that remind us

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.851
every day is a gift.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:18.159
Someone asked me once
where I belong.

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:22.329
I belong there.

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:30.204
Ms. Ellis,

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:33.808
you are an incredible boss,

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:36.210
but I quit.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:41.849
Now if you'll excuse me,
we have a plane to catch.

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:44.685
Merry Christmas, Jen,
and good luck.

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:48.289
Come on.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:22.990
Merry Christmas.

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:28.729
Mom, look who's here.

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:36.303
This is amazing.

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:42.510
I thought you went home.

01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:44.078
This is my home.

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:48.015
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

01:19:53.923 --> 01:19:56.390
The sleigh came together well,
didn't it?

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.092
I did have some help.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.194
Hopefully it'll do better
than the last one.

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:08.068
Mom? Dad?

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:11.038
What are you doing here?

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:12.573
Sweetie.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:15.387
- Hey.
- How are you, sir?

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:17.912
- This is Brian.
- Nice to meet you.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.381
Well, we were
headed off to Kenya.

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.550
Yeah, to see the elephant
that Aunt Helen left me.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:25.986
But then we started talking
about you and Aunt Helen.

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:27.833
Yeah, and we heard so much
about this town,

01:20:27.857 --> 01:20:30.424
we thought why not come see it
for ourselves.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:33.227
It's even more beautiful
than Aunt Helen said.

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:35.796
So who did the decorating?

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:38.599
Actually, she did.

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:41.769
Wait. You did all of this?

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:44.939
- I had help.
- But it was all her idea.

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:49.310
Well, you're lucky 'cause we're
planning on sticking around a little bit.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:53.581
Good...
because so am I.

01:20:53.616 --> 01:20:55.449
Really?

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.518
Yeah. Like someone said:

01:20:57.587 --> 01:20:59.467
You should never wait
until you're too old

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:02.857
to relax and have some time
to yourself.

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:06.238
Plus I'm really beginning to see
what Aunt Helen saw in this place.

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:09.663
Well, we're proud of you,
sweetheart.

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:12.333
So how about it?
You got a vacancy?

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:15.970
Well, the Polar Bear Room
is occupied,

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:19.373
but you might enjoy
the Moose Suite.

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:20.708
Wait, we have a Moose Suite?

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:23.244
Sounds like Aunt Helen,
all right.

01:21:23.346 --> 01:21:25.045
Moose Suite, okay.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:29.650
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.056
Merry Christmas.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.792
Merry Christmas.
