00:06.000 --> 00:07.916
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:08.000 --> 00:12.458
What were a civil police officer
and a member of a criminal organization

00:12.541 --> 00:14.500
doing in the same car?

00:14.583 --> 00:18.000
Rifle fire in a neighborhood
of the capital

00:18.083 --> 00:20.375
killed them both this morning.

00:20.458 --> 00:24.541
We work hard to defend
the police on this show.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.208
That cop was caught with drug dealers.

00:27.291 --> 00:30.958
He did not deserve
to be part of the force.

00:31.041 --> 00:33.000
Do we have a suspect?

00:33.083 --> 00:35.541
Show his face on the screen.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.166
Please, on the screen.

00:37.916 --> 00:40.833
Tomás Mendes, also known as Caneta.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.541
A key figure in the criminal organization

00:43.625 --> 00:45.666
that wreaks havoc in the state.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.791
Over 100 bullets.

00:47.875 --> 00:51.750
As soon as the police have
more information on the suspects,

00:51.833 --> 00:53.166
we'll disclose it.

00:54.250 --> 00:58.041
Those pigs are exposing my face
on national television.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.833
I gotta cross the border.

00:59.916 --> 01:02.458
-Go. Don't worry.
-Alright, brother.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.750
The business is under control.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.458
I'll keep things running.

01:06.541 --> 01:08.250
Holler if you need anything.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.791
-Cool, Nando.
-Alright.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.000
Good luck.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.666
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL IDEA BY KONDZILLA

01:25.125 --> 01:26.083
Yo, family.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.125
Since we're all here,

01:28.208 --> 01:30.125
there's something I want to say.

01:30.208 --> 01:32.041
Lindão's death.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.458
Tell us what happened.

01:34.541 --> 01:35.666
Here's the thing.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.666
They're reporting someone killed the pig

01:38.750 --> 01:40.541
and our homie Lindão.

01:40.625 --> 01:43.916
Tell us, Nando. Are you involved in this?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.791
Be honest with us.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.916
-Greetings, brothers.
-Yo.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.083
I ghosted that bitch. He was getting cozy
with cops. Shoot first, ask later.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.875
-With cops, that's what you do.
-That's right.

01:54.958 --> 01:57.250
We light them up.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.250
But what about our homie Lindão?

02:00.333 --> 02:02.041
Excuse me, family.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.375
Here's the thing.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.875
That fucking Lindão

02:06.958 --> 02:09.958
was helping the pigs raid our shit.

02:10.708 --> 02:13.250
I gave the go-ahead to off them both.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.250
Here's the evidence.
The two of them getting cozy.

02:16.750 --> 02:20.000
I told you about the raids
they've been carrying out.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.750
There's our rat.

02:24.791 --> 02:25.750
Pass it around.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.458
Nando, don't get me wrong.

02:28.541 --> 02:31.125
Can you prove this guy
with Lindão is a cop?

02:31.208 --> 02:33.166
Are you questioning my honesty?

02:33.666 --> 02:36.083
That's the proof. Lindão and a cop.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.625
Lindão used to be my partner in this.

02:38.708 --> 02:39.708
We get busted,

02:39.791 --> 02:42.458
and he's caught with my load and a cop?

02:42.541 --> 02:45.625
We went for Lindão's throat.
The cop was with him again.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.166
What the fuck?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.833
Bro, I dug into your past.

02:49.916 --> 02:51.333
You've been an asset.

02:51.416 --> 02:54.041
I still am, brother. In this 100%.

02:54.125 --> 02:58.125
Yes, but you've been judged
for this same mistake before.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.458
Acting on your own.

02:59.541 --> 03:00.791
That's right, man.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.833
You know you gotta run it by us.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.791
Can't do shit on your own.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.791
You can't go around
killing people as you please.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.000
What Robinho said is right.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.958
This is not the first time.

03:12.041 --> 03:14.583
You're part of the family.
Gotta act straight.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.666
Gotta set the example.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.916
The consequences are more serious.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.250
Your behavior put you in a bad spot.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.000
Yeah, boy. This is what's happening.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.625
What happens when you kill a brother?

03:26.708 --> 03:28.416
You pay with your life.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.083
Rita?

03:41.666 --> 03:42.625
Rita?

03:44.500 --> 03:45.375
Hey, Formiga.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.041
Excuse me.

03:51.791 --> 03:53.000
What happened?

03:54.125 --> 03:57.541
There's something bothering me.
I can't stop thinking about it.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.916
I need your help.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.500
Formiga, you can tell me.

04:04.291 --> 04:06.041
I'm done with this life.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.666
I don't wanna die in crime.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.375
I wanna die with Jesus.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I want to give my soul to Jesus.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.833
Just like you did.

04:29.416 --> 04:30.500
I'm here, Formiga.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.250
I'm with you.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.208
Thank you.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.500
Alright, Nando. Spit it out.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.875
Brother, let's not dig shit up
for no reason.

04:54.958 --> 04:58.000
That issue was resolved,
and I was in the right.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.833
-The fuck?
-Who gave the go-ahead?

05:03.916 --> 05:05.666
I told you already.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.041
I gave the go-ahead.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.333
Going around putting people to sleep?

05:10.416 --> 05:12.541
There's a hierarchy in place.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.791
Something this big
needed approval from higher levels.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.750
Bro, what's your point? I'm not following.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.416
I'm not alone in this.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.541
-Where's Boi? Put him on.
-Call him.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.750
Please, Boi. Go ahead.

05:25.833 --> 05:28.291
Yo, brothers. This is Boi.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.208
-Hey.
-Hey, Boi.

05:30.291 --> 05:32.083
The order came from us.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.791
We gave them the task.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.750
You fucking with me?
We're the crime, fucker.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.708
You get cozy with the pigs,
we pop your head off.

05:39.791 --> 05:41.458
You hear me?

05:41.541 --> 05:43.666
-Mess up and you're gone.
-Okay, Boi.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.916
The homie is right.
Let's put this shit to rest.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.500
Write it down and let's move on.

05:49.583 --> 05:54.083
I just wanted to say
that we gotta be on alert now.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.083
That's right, brothers.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.083
The pig was a big shot.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.625
We gotta be prepared for the retaliation.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.166
And be smart, brother.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.250
They've identified Caneta.
They can get to you.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.458
I'm aware. Keeping my eyes peeled.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.625
Nando from the Village, check this out.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.750
From now on, you're in charge of the books

06:16.833 --> 06:20.791
from every store in the East Zone.
You copy?

06:20.875 --> 06:22.833
Got it, Boi. You can trust me.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.625
It's a big deal, boy. It's in your hands.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.041
-Peace out, brothers.
-Yeah, Nando!

06:28.625 --> 06:30.291
-Responsibility.
-Later.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.208
-Good luck.
-Peace.

06:32.291 --> 06:33.416
That's right.

06:38.875 --> 06:42.666
Doni, I've been thinking
of how to make your next single a hit.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.083
A collab with Kevinho.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.125
Get us both in a studio.

06:47.208 --> 06:50.208
Kevinho is the apex.
You wouldn't be able to top it.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.875
Trust me like I trusted you.

06:53.458 --> 06:54.666
Let's dream together.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.000
Alright. Let's dream together.

07:03.041 --> 07:03.958
Give me a beat.

07:04.666 --> 07:06.916
This girl's up to no good

07:07.000 --> 07:11.500
She gets all naughty
When she's out with her friends

07:12.083 --> 07:14.458
Tonight she's going to the club

07:14.541 --> 07:15.875
Have some tequila

07:15.958 --> 07:16.791
Like this?

07:16.875 --> 07:18.041
With liqueur

07:18.125 --> 07:20.541
-Yes, brother!
-That's it!

07:20.625 --> 07:22.000
Awesome!

07:26.375 --> 07:28.708
This is like a hit factory.

07:28.791 --> 07:29.666
Check this out.

07:29.750 --> 07:34.458
Doni knows no limits
He's a factory of hits

07:38.666 --> 07:40.916
-Hey, what's good?
-Sup?

07:41.000 --> 07:44.208
Guess who's gonna sing with Kevinho.

07:44.791 --> 07:48.958
Doni knows no limits
He's a factory of hits

07:49.041 --> 07:51.625
Every new song is the bomb

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
What's up?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.416
Doni…

07:56.208 --> 07:59.166
Jaspion and I have been talking.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.666
And we are leaving the team.

08:04.916 --> 08:06.458
What do you mean?

08:08.083 --> 08:10.083
Luan gave you shit? I'll call him.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.666
No, he didn't.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.750
It's our thing.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.208
We want to focus on our business,

08:16.291 --> 08:19.125
expand the barbershop
and our clothes shop.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.625
We're gonna be by your side,
but in a different way.

08:23.666 --> 08:26.291
We just miss the hood, man.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.666
We want to spend more time with Mom.

08:31.208 --> 08:33.125
I know how that is.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.916
I wasn't expecting it,
but I respect your decision.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.083
I'll miss you.

08:38.166 --> 08:41.625
You'll be with the top dogs.
You're recording with Kevinho.

08:41.708 --> 08:44.958
Here, a gift from our store to you.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.208
With a custom card.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.166
Thanks.

08:56.958 --> 09:00.916
Don't forget to post a photo with it
on Instagram to help us out.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.958
Alright.

09:03.291 --> 09:06.583
-We love you, man.
-I love you guys too.

09:07.541 --> 09:09.541
If you abandon me, you're fucked.

09:11.666 --> 09:12.916
Get the fuck off!

09:44.541 --> 09:46.208
It's perfect. Thank you.

09:50.541 --> 09:53.708
Everyone does that,
but no one knows what it's for.

09:53.791 --> 09:54.708
Relax.

09:56.791 --> 09:57.625
Got it.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.333
It was hard to pick a restaurant.
You suggested so many.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.708
Well, I can't cook.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.458
Welcome to my world. This is it.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.416
I see.

10:16.041 --> 10:17.166
You look gorgeous.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.083
Thank you.

10:19.625 --> 10:21.875
You're all spruced up yourself.

10:22.416 --> 10:23.416
Thanks.

10:27.416 --> 10:28.250
But

10:29.250 --> 10:30.833
the brands can tell

10:31.333 --> 10:33.625
that your T-shirt is fake.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.333
But I have good news.

10:39.416 --> 10:42.833
I know this brand's PR,
and he's gonna love you.

10:42.916 --> 10:44.083
Cool. What's that?

10:44.666 --> 10:47.333
It's the public relations guy.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.000
Get it?

10:49.625 --> 10:50.916
Got it.

10:51.416 --> 10:54.333
Maybe you could be my personal stylist.

10:54.416 --> 10:55.291
What do you say?

10:56.625 --> 10:57.583
I'm down.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.500
The bust turned out great for you.

13:10.583 --> 13:14.208
You got yourself a shop,
managed to climb up the ranks…

13:14.833 --> 13:16.291
I'm still here.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.375
Waiting for an opportunity to break free.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.791
You're gonna be free soon
and will never have to go back.

13:23.583 --> 13:24.416
I'm sure of it.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.583
But who's gonna welcome me?

13:27.125 --> 13:29.333
My guy has a lot on his plate now.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.583
I called to congratulate you.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.458
Thanks, Badá. Peace, bro.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.500
Listen, heads up.

13:38.583 --> 13:41.625
Those guys are going
to strike back big-time.

13:43.416 --> 13:46.666
-Alright, bro. Peace out.
-Peace, bro. Take care.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.166
Come, Cacau.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.833
-Go!
-Come with me, Mom!

14:07.916 --> 14:09.125
Come on!

14:09.916 --> 14:11.625
The steps are like this.

14:19.708 --> 14:20.750
Let's go!

14:21.708 --> 14:22.833
What?

14:24.416 --> 14:26.083
Peace out, Formiga.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.500
It's 3:00 a.m. It's over.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.000
Cacau, take everything.

14:46.916 --> 14:49.083
-Hi, Aunt Graça.
-Excuse us.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.416
Two hot dogs, please.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.166
Gotta smoke them, hear me?

14:55.500 --> 14:56.375
Here we are.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.625
-Jesus.
-Mom, tonight was great.

15:13.708 --> 15:15.416
My God! Gunshots!

15:15.500 --> 15:16.458
Mom, come!

15:46.708 --> 15:48.125
Fuck, Rivaldo!

15:48.708 --> 15:49.541
Rivaldo?

15:50.041 --> 15:52.375
Rivaldo! Brother, no…

15:52.458 --> 15:53.958
Rivaldo! No!

15:54.041 --> 15:56.041
No. No!

15:56.625 --> 15:58.166
Rivaldo!

15:58.250 --> 16:00.625
Rivaldo, talk to me!

16:00.708 --> 16:02.541
No! Help!

16:02.625 --> 16:05.750
Look at me… Somebody call my mom!

16:05.833 --> 16:07.208
Mom!

16:07.958 --> 16:10.000
No, Brother! Talk to me!

16:10.083 --> 16:11.166
Look at me!

16:11.250 --> 16:14.541
I told Mom we'd go home together!

16:15.458 --> 16:17.541
Somebody help me, please!

16:17.625 --> 16:19.333
My brother!

16:19.833 --> 16:21.708
Not my brother!

16:21.791 --> 16:23.291
Rivaldo, my God!

16:24.041 --> 16:25.583
Mom!

16:40.291 --> 16:43.083
HAIRDRESSER

17:05.125 --> 17:06.333
Son…

17:09.250 --> 17:12.125
-My condolences, Mrs. Rose.
-Doni, thank you.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.958
Man, I tried to scream,

17:14.041 --> 17:16.625
tell him to get down, but it was too late.

17:16.708 --> 17:17.958
It's not your fault.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.000
Okay? It's not your fault.

17:23.958 --> 17:26.000
-Breathe.
-Rose…

17:26.083 --> 17:27.583
I'm so sorry.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.666
They took my boy from me, Sueli.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.375
They took him.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.333
God is with him.

17:37.041 --> 17:37.875
Nando.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.041
Hey, brother.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.291
-My condolences.
-Thanks.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.791
It's such a tragedy.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.416
Send my best to Aunt Rose

17:46.250 --> 17:47.750
and to Jaspion, okay?

17:48.791 --> 17:49.833
Take care.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.708
Okay, bro. See you.

17:58.833 --> 17:59.708
Hey.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.083
Hey.

18:01.625 --> 18:02.833
What do we do now?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.875
We can't leave it like that.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.000
People don't care what happens here.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.291
They think only bad news comes from here.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.083
We gotta attract attention.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.041
We can't stay quiet.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.500
Attention!

18:28.583 --> 18:31.666
A massacre in the poor neighborhood
of Vila Áurea

18:31.750 --> 18:32.875
leaves three dead.

18:32.958 --> 18:35.500
According to the police,
it was a turf war.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.833
But so far, no suspects
have been identified.

18:38.916 --> 18:41.250
He worked since he was little.

18:42.583 --> 18:46.416
He went out to have fun with his friends.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.833
Why did they take my son's life?

18:49.916 --> 18:51.125
Why?

18:51.208 --> 18:53.541
Why, God?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.791
They're saying it was a turf war.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.583
A gang dispute.

18:59.666 --> 19:02.208
Enough! We're tired of hearing this.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.958
Every time someone dies here,
it's the same thing.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.291
Rivaldo had a barbershop, a store.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.791
He was an honest boy!

19:09.875 --> 19:13.875
We can't continue seeing
our families being slaughtered.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.333
We can't stand it.

19:15.958 --> 19:19.625
Yet another mother crying
over the loss of her son.

19:19.708 --> 19:23.750
For the son she lost
to this never-ending violence.

19:24.666 --> 19:28.625
"We can't continue seeing
our families being slaughtered."

19:29.208 --> 19:30.625
Heartbreaking.

19:30.708 --> 19:31.916
I'm with you,

19:32.500 --> 19:34.541
Rita from Vila Áurea.

19:58.791 --> 20:00.541
It's time to lie low, man.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.083
Under the radar.

20:02.833 --> 20:03.916
I heard the news.

20:04.791 --> 20:06.916
It was retribution for the dead cop.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.500
A death squad in my hood?

20:10.625 --> 20:12.958
These guys won't rest
until they get to me.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.708
But family comes first.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.666
But we're not the kind of men
to have only one family.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.208
You're doing the books now.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.625
Be careful who you trust, man.

20:30.291 --> 20:31.250
I know.

20:36.041 --> 20:37.333
Wonderful art.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.041
FRIENDS FOREVER

20:39.125 --> 20:41.083
So many beautiful messages.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.083
I love this picture.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.708
I can almost hear him laughing.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.250
Hey.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.083
Hey, Jussara.

20:55.666 --> 20:58.333
Listen. Rose, the other mothers, and I

20:58.416 --> 21:02.000
are thinking of organizing
a rally or something, you know?

21:02.083 --> 21:04.458
To show they weren't criminals.

21:04.541 --> 21:06.166
We should do that. I'm in.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.708
Lord, when I think it could've been her…

21:08.791 --> 21:11.541
-God forbid, Jussara!
-Goodness gracious…

21:12.166 --> 21:15.166
Let's see if that TV guy
sends his reporter again.

21:15.666 --> 21:16.666
Yeah.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.916
-I'll go check on Rose.
-Okay.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.291
I'M TELLING MY PARENTS
ABOUT US TODAY!!! OK?

21:26.375 --> 21:32.708
HOLD ON FOR NOW.
I'M A WRECK.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.916
SORRY ABOUT RIVALDINHO,
I'M DEVASTATED.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.083
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.291
COUNT ON ME!!

21:56.958 --> 21:58.958
MESSAGE RECEIVED

22:00.958 --> 22:03.791
Doni, how are you doing?
Sorry for your loss.

22:03.875 --> 22:07.125
Rivaldo was a great friend.
We will miss him.

22:07.208 --> 22:11.500
If you need some time,
we'll reschedule with Kevinho.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.000
Hey, Luan. Thank you.

22:16.916 --> 22:20.166
I'm thinking whether I should go
to the funeral

22:20.875 --> 22:23.041
or write a song about this.

22:23.791 --> 22:25.500
But the Kevinho thing is on.

22:26.708 --> 22:27.916
Take care. Thanks.

22:41.916 --> 22:44.583
The ninjas weren't playing around.
It was crazy.

22:44.666 --> 22:47.416
Fucking psychos.
You know what's fucked up?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.375
They were innocent.
They had nothing to do with it.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.708
I'm sure it's retaliation. They were cops.

22:53.791 --> 22:54.958
That's obvious.

22:59.416 --> 23:00.541
Fucking crazy.

23:00.625 --> 23:02.416
I gotta be gone for a while.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.583
We gotta set up shop elsewhere.

23:05.666 --> 23:06.958
You're in charge of it.

23:16.333 --> 23:20.083
Nando, I got shit to take care of.
Let me know.

23:20.583 --> 23:21.666
-Night.
-Night.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.458
-Peace, bro.
-Peace.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.541
Hey, brother. It's your cut, Formiga.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.541
What's wrong, man? You don't want it?

23:36.750 --> 23:37.750
No, brother.

23:40.208 --> 23:42.291
I don't want that responsibility.

23:42.375 --> 23:44.291
Not after what happened.

23:44.875 --> 23:45.791
Speak up, bro.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.291
This life is not for me.

23:50.083 --> 23:52.000
You know I wasn't born for this.

23:54.375 --> 23:55.833
You think I like it?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.625
What else could I do?

24:00.125 --> 24:01.208
There's no other way.

24:02.291 --> 24:05.458
I'm gonna accept Jesus. I'll go to church.

24:09.333 --> 24:12.833
Now that I need you the most,
you're gonna beat it?

24:13.458 --> 24:14.666
Fuck, Formiga!

24:14.750 --> 24:16.083
Bro, God spoke to me.

24:16.666 --> 24:18.041
I felt it in my heart.

24:18.708 --> 24:21.041
If not now, when will I get out?

24:21.125 --> 24:22.708
If I ever get out.

24:24.125 --> 24:26.000
I wish I had your grit, man.

24:26.583 --> 24:27.958
I admire you.

24:28.833 --> 24:29.916
But I can't.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.083
Just can't.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.041
Godspeed, bro.

24:49.625 --> 24:50.625
Pray for us.

24:51.333 --> 24:52.666
I'm with you, bro.

25:17.416 --> 25:20.083
Hey, Pulga. You're in charge
of the shop now.

25:32.791 --> 25:36.291
I'll take care of the banners
and the T-shirts.

25:36.375 --> 25:37.458
Alright.

25:44.083 --> 25:45.375
Hey, Ritinha.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.333
I'm in a rush.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.375
Tell me, how are you?

25:50.125 --> 25:51.791
Hanging in there. You?

25:52.375 --> 25:53.500
I'm alright.

25:54.125 --> 25:55.625
What's up?

25:55.708 --> 26:00.000
We need to print
some T-shirts and banners.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.916
Basic stuff but in bulk.

26:02.458 --> 26:03.375
Today.

26:03.916 --> 26:04.916
Done.

26:05.833 --> 26:06.833
Thanks, brother.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.958
Sorry, I didn't want to ask you,

26:10.041 --> 26:12.250
but I took on debt with the church…

26:12.333 --> 26:14.875
Don't worry, Ritinha. It's all good.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.125
Thanks, brother.

26:17.041 --> 26:18.000
Rita,

26:19.625 --> 26:20.833
take care of my boy.

26:22.625 --> 26:23.583
Formiga came.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.458
When are you coming?

26:31.208 --> 26:32.625
I gotta go.

26:32.708 --> 26:33.750
Thank you.

26:47.791 --> 26:52.000
WE WANT JUSTICE

26:58.041 --> 26:59.916
-Hello?
-Hi, Rita.

27:00.625 --> 27:03.375
Sorry to keep calling,
but you kinda disappeared.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.375
I'm sorry, Levi.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.125
So much has happened.

27:08.750 --> 27:10.166
I didn't see you called.

27:10.666 --> 27:12.583
Where are you?

27:12.666 --> 27:14.583
At home. What about you?

27:15.458 --> 27:17.166
Closer than you think.

27:26.791 --> 27:29.833
I just came to tell you
I'm here if you need me.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.416
I can see that.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.750
Rita, I know you're going through a lot.

27:37.583 --> 27:40.041
And what you're doing is important.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.208
I worry about you, Rita.

27:43.708 --> 27:44.541
That's all.

28:05.041 --> 28:07.458
So, Daddy, is there a pool?

28:08.208 --> 28:09.166
Yes.

28:09.708 --> 28:11.458
There's a pool.

28:12.041 --> 28:14.958
There's ice cream, cartoons.

28:15.541 --> 28:18.333
Daddy is gonna play with you
all day long, okay?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.333
Is Mommy unsure?

28:35.125 --> 28:36.333
We'll come back, right?

28:39.041 --> 28:40.541
Come, baby.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.166
Is it good?

28:48.833 --> 28:50.500
The shirt is beautiful!

28:51.458 --> 28:52.875
Thank you for your help.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.166
I wish I were there.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.041
I know.

28:56.583 --> 28:59.416
But it's for the best.
You would shift the focus.

29:00.583 --> 29:03.875
But keep an eye out for posts
and share everything.

29:03.958 --> 29:05.625
-Everyone should know.
-Deal.

29:06.125 --> 29:07.875
-Take care.
-Hey.

29:08.625 --> 29:09.583
Be good.

29:09.666 --> 29:10.750
I love you.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.875
WE WANT JUSTICE

29:43.000 --> 29:45.500
THE FAVELA WANTS PEACE

29:46.166 --> 29:50.250
Rivaldo, my brother.
I think of you all the time.

29:50.833 --> 29:54.833
I keep trying to feel
what you felt when you were shot.

29:55.833 --> 29:58.041
Did you feel like crying?

29:58.708 --> 30:00.125
Like screaming?

30:01.041 --> 30:03.250
Did he miss you, Mom?

30:05.041 --> 30:07.458
Rivaldo was the best barber.

30:07.958 --> 30:11.375
Now he can't teach his friends
and the kids from the hood.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.291
They say everything has its time.

30:15.375 --> 30:17.041
But this wasn't his.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.083
You were so young,

30:19.166 --> 30:21.541
and the favela cries again.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.416
A good, hard-working kid,

30:23.500 --> 30:26.041
no enemies, just allies.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.625
But now, without Rivaldo,
all there's left is heartache.

30:29.708 --> 30:32.666
There's no justice
in the far reaches of the city.

30:32.750 --> 30:36.041
Our cry doesn't disturb
the sleep of the authorities.

30:36.625 --> 30:39.125
It's wrong. It's a life.

30:39.208 --> 30:41.041
They make it sound so trivial.

30:41.125 --> 30:44.583
In rich neighborhoods,
there are no accidental shootings.

30:44.666 --> 30:46.291
No massacres,

30:46.375 --> 30:48.583
no humiliation. It's a different picture.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.875
Rivaldo, I will miss you.

30:51.958 --> 30:54.166
You will always be remembered.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.958
It won't be in vain!

30:57.041 --> 30:59.125
Your blood and our tears.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.458
A heartfelt hug from your cousin.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.333
If you can, look after us.

31:08.583 --> 31:11.333
JUSTICE

31:12.666 --> 31:16.291
-I wanna go to the beach.
-You're still up? Where, honey?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.166
To the beach.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.083
We're going somewhere even better, okay?

31:26.958 --> 31:28.083
Nando, what's this?

31:29.958 --> 31:31.333
Nando, what's this?

31:31.416 --> 31:32.791
Nando, what's going on?

31:32.875 --> 31:34.541
What's going on? Talk to me.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.791
-Out of the car.
-Nando?

31:36.875 --> 31:39.875
-Shit's falling apart.
-Let's negotiate.

31:41.916 --> 31:44.250
We don't want problems, just solutions.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.625
My wife and daughter are in the car.

31:46.708 --> 31:47.958
Just say how much.

31:48.708 --> 31:49.541
Two mil.

31:51.833 --> 31:53.208
Wanna negotiate or not?

31:55.625 --> 31:59.250
Word around town
is that you offed the cop.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.291
Fifty, in one hour.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.125
That's ridiculous.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.666
One hundred.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.458
You're getting bigger.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.583
So is your price.

32:12.666 --> 32:14.375
They want you in jail.

32:14.916 --> 32:16.583
Some want you dead.

32:17.291 --> 32:19.625
Less than one mil won't do.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.625
Five hundred.

32:25.708 --> 32:26.750
No deal.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.291
One mil, and you disappear.

32:32.333 --> 32:33.916
Give me your number.

32:35.625 --> 32:36.791
Where's the doll?

32:37.875 --> 32:38.750
Show it to Mommy.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.416
If you do your part,

32:40.500 --> 32:41.625
you can rest easy.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.541
-If not--
-Brother, I'm paying.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.333
My family is big too. Don't mess with us.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.500
It's Daddy, honey. He's back.

32:56.125 --> 32:59.000
MOURNING
RIVALDO LOVE FOREVER

32:59.083 --> 33:00.541
The last time I saw him,

33:01.333 --> 33:02.791
he said, "Mom,

33:03.375 --> 33:04.250
I'm going out

33:04.333 --> 33:07.125
to have fun with my friends."

33:07.208 --> 33:09.583
"Wake me up early

33:09.666 --> 33:13.666
because I have a client
at the barbershop."

33:15.291 --> 33:20.208
My son went out and was shot dead.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.291
We have names.

33:23.375 --> 33:26.291
We have names. We matter.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.375
We have families. We have a story.

33:30.250 --> 33:34.166
I want to propose a minute of silence

33:35.541 --> 33:39.416
for the lives of Wesley,
Diogo, and Rivaldo.

33:53.041 --> 33:55.333
-Wesley Santos!
-He's here.

33:55.416 --> 33:57.458
-Diogo Faria!
-He's here!

33:57.541 --> 33:59.750
-Rivaldo Ferreira!
-He's here!

34:39.583 --> 34:42.000
Hey, Doni! How are you, man?

34:42.083 --> 34:43.333
How are you doing?

34:43.416 --> 34:45.875
Good. You're blowing up, man.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.916
Thanks. Studio's looking dope.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.583
It is dope.

34:49.666 --> 34:52.000
-Make yourself at home.
-Great, man.

34:52.083 --> 34:53.083
-Thanks.
-Cool.

34:53.708 --> 34:55.333
My boy Doni!

34:55.416 --> 34:56.875
-Hey, Kevinho.
-What's up?

34:56.958 --> 34:58.666
-Cool.
-My condolences, man.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.958
I saw your post. That's tough.

35:01.041 --> 35:04.250
Thanks. The first time
I did the slit was with him.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.583
He was learning. The blade scared me.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.583
But he nailed it.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.583
If I made it,
it's because of people like him.

35:14.666 --> 35:16.208
Right on, brother.

35:16.291 --> 35:17.666
That's music.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.416
To leave a mark on people

35:19.500 --> 35:21.375
like they leave a mark on us.

35:21.458 --> 35:23.333
That's right. Give us the hit.

35:23.416 --> 35:25.541
The studio. Ain't it great?

35:25.625 --> 35:26.500
Dope.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.208
My man, DJ Pernambuco.

35:28.291 --> 35:29.458
-Hey, man.
-Sup?

35:29.541 --> 35:31.083
-Is this him?
-The man.

35:31.166 --> 35:32.750
-He's blown up.
-Hey.

35:32.833 --> 35:35.083
Oh yeah? Is the surprise for him?

35:35.166 --> 35:38.583
Here's the deal.
We have a little surprise for you.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.750
-Ready?
-Shoot.

35:41.333 --> 35:42.208
There.

35:44.541 --> 35:45.791
Is that Alok?

35:46.291 --> 35:49.125
Come with me, boy.

35:49.208 --> 35:51.291
-Damn. What's up?
-Nice meeting you.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.125
Fuck, it's Alok alright!

35:54.208 --> 35:55.750
Let's make a hit?

35:55.833 --> 35:57.000
Let's roll.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.583
Kevinho, Doni, and Alok. It's a hit.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.958
Doni, Kevinho, and Alok. Kidding.

36:02.041 --> 36:03.958
No fighting. We'll sort it out.

36:04.041 --> 36:05.333
-Let's do this?
-Yeah!

36:05.416 --> 36:07.500
The pen never runs out of ink.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.166
One hit after another.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.750
Let's go!

36:10.833 --> 36:14.750
Doni knows no limits
He's a factory of hits

36:14.833 --> 36:17.791
Every new song is the bomb

36:17.875 --> 36:20.041
It's a perfect mix
Voice and beat

36:20.125 --> 36:22.000
The chicks can't resist it

36:22.083 --> 36:24.791
When it gets to the chorus
Here we go

36:24.875 --> 36:27.375
When the speakers are blasting

36:27.458 --> 36:29.208
They lose their minds

36:29.291 --> 36:31.166
Booties drop to the floor

36:31.250 --> 36:32.500
A different beat.

36:32.583 --> 36:34.541
When the speakers are blasting

36:34.625 --> 36:36.541
They lose their minds

36:36.625 --> 36:39.958
Booties drop to the floor
They just can't stop

36:40.041 --> 36:41.958
When the speakers are blasting

36:42.041 --> 36:45.333
They lose their minds
Booties drop to the floor

36:45.416 --> 36:46.791
They just can't stop

36:46.875 --> 36:48.833
When the speakers are blasting

36:48.916 --> 36:50.875
They lose their mind

36:50.958 --> 36:56.041
Booties drop to the floor
They just can't stop

36:57.125 --> 36:58.666
Drop it to the floor!

36:59.416 --> 37:01.125
Drop it, drop it, go

37:02.958 --> 37:04.791
That is dope.

37:08.791 --> 37:12.541
Kevinho knows no limits
He's a factory of hits

37:12.625 --> 37:15.375
Every new song is the bomb

37:15.458 --> 37:17.875
The perfect mix
Voice and beat

37:17.958 --> 37:21.458
The chicks can't resist
When it gets to the chorus

37:21.541 --> 37:22.625
So go

37:22.708 --> 37:25.333
When the speakers are blasting

37:25.416 --> 37:26.958
They lose their minds

37:27.041 --> 37:30.125
Booties drop to the floor
They just can't stop

37:30.208 --> 37:32.333
When the speakers are blasting

37:32.416 --> 37:34.000
They lose their minds

37:34.083 --> 37:37.416
Booties drop to the floor
They just can't stop

37:37.500 --> 37:41.375
When the speakers are blasting
They lose their minds

37:41.458 --> 37:44.333
Booties drop to the floor
They just can't stop

37:44.416 --> 37:46.666
And when the speakers are blasting

37:46.750 --> 37:48.500
They lose their mind

37:48.583 --> 37:50.416
Booties drop to the floor

37:50.500 --> 37:54.416
They just can't stop it

37:57.291 --> 37:59.041
Drop it, drop it, go

38:11.791 --> 38:13.708
Drop it, drop it, go

38:14.625 --> 38:16.125
-Hey!
-Hey.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.458
What's up, guys? Is it a hit or what?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.416
When the speakers are blasting

38:26.500 --> 38:28.083
They lose their minds

38:28.166 --> 38:31.625
"A hit or what," Doni?
It's the hit of the summer.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.875
Hey, keep that passport handy.

38:34.375 --> 38:36.708
-We're going to Europe.
-Europe?

38:38.375 --> 38:40.791
London, Paris, and Lisbon.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.333
To start off.

38:42.416 --> 38:44.833
-But keep working hard!
-Alright.

38:44.916 --> 38:48.333
Keep dreaming big. No one can stop you.

38:50.916 --> 38:52.375
Off to Europe, then!

38:52.458 --> 38:54.625
-Let's hear it for him!
-Thank you.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.208
Tough kid.

38:56.291 --> 38:59.000
We did it. We did it, man.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.583
Do you know why we called you?

39:01.666 --> 39:05.333
Our congregation will sponsor
the candidacy of a young member

39:05.416 --> 39:07.875
to represent us at City Council.

39:07.958 --> 39:09.250
Yes, Levi.

39:09.750 --> 39:12.875
Pastor Leopoldo and I
talked to the party's strategist

39:12.958 --> 39:14.583
about voting prospects.

39:14.666 --> 39:17.291
He saw the huge appeal you have,

39:17.375 --> 39:19.625
especially among the youth.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.458
I'll get to the point.

39:22.041 --> 39:25.000
Pastor Val and I invite you,
on behalf of our church,

39:25.083 --> 39:28.583
to launch you
as a potential candidate for City Council.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.958
Sure, we need to prepare you.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.958
It's a process,
but I want to know what you think.

39:34.041 --> 39:37.291
I know this invitation
seems out of the blue,

39:37.833 --> 39:40.208
but we've been eyeing you for a while.

39:40.708 --> 39:42.000
You're just the right fit.

39:45.458 --> 39:46.291
Well,

39:47.041 --> 39:48.333
I'm speechless.

39:55.875 --> 39:56.833
Excuse me.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.333
So, was it like you imagined?

39:59.416 --> 40:00.916
-You knew?
-Of course.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.291
Look at you!

40:03.041 --> 40:04.250
Listen,

40:05.500 --> 40:07.541
I'll tell my parents
about us this week, okay?

40:08.416 --> 40:11.541
Especially now, their approval
will mean a lot to me.

40:13.125 --> 40:14.708
I need to talk to you.

40:14.791 --> 40:15.916
Go ahead.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.791
I spent more than I should
in the inauguration.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.750
I know, Rita.

40:21.708 --> 40:23.708
-Do your parents know?
-Yes.

40:23.791 --> 40:26.166
Tell them I'm gonna pay it.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.208
I mean it. I won't let the church pay.

40:29.291 --> 40:30.333
What do you mean?

40:30.833 --> 40:32.041
It's been paid.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.916
Someone made a donation
specifically for that.

40:35.916 --> 40:36.750
Who?

40:37.416 --> 40:38.625
It was anonymous, but clear.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.958
"To pay for the party."

41:15.416 --> 41:16.583
-What's up?
-Hey.

41:16.666 --> 41:17.875
-All good?
-Yeah.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.333
-Hey, man.
-What's up, bro?

41:20.416 --> 41:21.750
How are you, Jaspion?

41:22.875 --> 41:24.083
You know,

41:24.916 --> 41:26.083
missing him.

41:27.666 --> 41:29.541
-You know how it is.
-Yeah.

41:30.416 --> 41:33.375
It's tough, man.
But you're right. Don't stop.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.458
Rivaldo wanted it to succeed.

41:43.458 --> 41:45.750
How about Luzi? Pumping out hits?

41:45.833 --> 41:47.708
She came to help me out.

41:48.291 --> 41:51.583
At least I parted ways
with my old manager.

41:51.666 --> 41:53.875
-You did?
-I had to.

41:53.958 --> 41:55.875
Let's go see Luan, then.

41:56.458 --> 41:58.041
We'll work together again?

41:58.625 --> 42:01.458
If he manages your career with me, sure.

42:02.416 --> 42:05.333
When I return from Europe,
we'll sort this out.

42:05.416 --> 42:06.333
Deal.

42:06.416 --> 42:08.333
Do you have time for me?

42:08.416 --> 42:09.375
Right now.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.375
No, I do the scheduling.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.791
Cancel the next three. I'll be a while.

42:25.625 --> 42:28.833
It's just another step
in everything you've been doing.

42:29.666 --> 42:31.166
Just look at this church.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.333
Everything's working out
better than ever for me.

42:35.416 --> 42:37.083
What a blessing!

42:37.166 --> 42:38.708
The church's opening.

42:39.333 --> 42:41.291
The debt being paid off.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.708
This unexpected offer.

42:43.791 --> 42:44.875
Even Levi.

42:45.916 --> 42:47.166
I don't know, Pastor.

42:47.916 --> 42:49.250
I'm not sure I deserve it.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.333
Rita, haven't you earned it?

42:52.500 --> 42:53.416
So…

42:55.166 --> 42:57.833
Now, let's welcome people to church?

42:57.916 --> 42:59.041
Yes!

43:09.791 --> 43:12.666
I got rid of everything
that tied me to it.

43:12.750 --> 43:15.750
I want to find Jesus. It might not work…

43:15.833 --> 43:17.666
It's working, Formiga.

43:19.166 --> 43:21.291
-It was you, right?
-Me what?

43:21.375 --> 43:24.041
"To pay for the party
of Vila Áurea's church."

43:29.166 --> 43:30.958
Looking good in the picture?

43:31.041 --> 43:32.833
It's great, man.

43:35.333 --> 43:38.000
Hold up! I take care of the talent.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.791
We're going international.

43:40.875 --> 43:42.125
That's right, kid!

43:42.208 --> 43:43.916
-We made it.
-We did.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.916
I knew you'd go places.

43:49.458 --> 43:51.416
-What do you want?
-The float.

43:51.500 --> 43:52.625
The pink float!

43:52.708 --> 43:54.375
Is that what you want?

43:54.458 --> 43:55.500
No hands!

43:56.000 --> 43:58.750
Swim this way. Come!

43:59.416 --> 44:01.625
Swim this way.

44:01.708 --> 44:03.458
Such a princess!

44:03.541 --> 44:06.416
What's up, everyone?
Here to give a message.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.666
My first European tour is coming up.

44:08.750 --> 44:11.708
I'll perform in London, Paris, and Lisbon.

44:11.791 --> 44:14.208
Come in hot, and get ready!

44:16.041 --> 44:18.500
Hello, boys. Have you seen Levi?

44:19.458 --> 44:20.708
Oh, thanks.

44:27.625 --> 44:30.125
-Hey. Did you want to see me?
-Yes.

44:30.208 --> 44:32.041
I have ideas for the campaign.

44:34.666 --> 44:35.833
Have a seat, please.

44:51.750 --> 44:52.791
Rita…

44:57.083 --> 44:59.083
God revealed a prophecy to my mom.

45:04.333 --> 45:05.583
She saw that…

45:08.750 --> 45:10.708
my future is not with you.

45:17.083 --> 45:18.041
I'm sorry.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.541
I can't do anything.

45:30.083 --> 45:31.000
Levi…

45:33.791 --> 45:35.416
I know that prophecy.

45:38.916 --> 45:42.416
She'd never want her prince
to get involved with a nobody.

45:43.000 --> 45:43.833
Right?

46:10.458 --> 46:11.375
What's this?

46:12.208 --> 46:13.166
What's in here?

46:13.958 --> 46:15.125
Baby.

46:15.208 --> 46:16.583
Baby!

46:16.666 --> 46:18.166
Nice house, brother!

46:18.250 --> 46:20.250
-You like it?
-Damn.

46:20.333 --> 46:22.166
-Awesome!
-Hey!

46:23.166 --> 46:25.833
Look who is here!

46:25.916 --> 46:28.208
Bringing some life into this place.

46:28.291 --> 46:30.166
You're glowing, Scheyla!

46:30.250 --> 46:32.125
Thanks! How are you, Ritinha?

46:32.208 --> 46:34.000
How much time is left?

46:34.083 --> 46:35.875
We're almost there.

46:35.958 --> 46:37.708
-Hey. All good?
-You're okay?

46:38.291 --> 46:40.166
-You're doing well, man.
-You know it.

46:41.541 --> 46:44.791
Could we imagine such a place
when we were kids? Never.

46:44.875 --> 46:46.833
I did, but we weren't in it.

46:48.666 --> 46:49.958
But I'll be honest.

46:50.041 --> 46:52.625
I never imagined you'd be a star,

46:52.708 --> 46:54.166
and you'd be a politician.

46:54.250 --> 46:56.041
That's how I like it!

46:56.125 --> 46:57.375
How's Bruninha doing?

46:57.458 --> 46:59.333
She won't leave the pool.

46:59.416 --> 47:01.000
She's like a little fish.

47:01.083 --> 47:03.166
Just try to get her out of there.

47:03.666 --> 47:04.500
I can imagine.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.916
Have you picked a name already?

47:07.708 --> 47:08.666
Tell her.

47:08.750 --> 47:11.833
We haven't chosen a name.
We chose something else.

47:12.833 --> 47:14.625
Scheyla and I were talking.

47:15.208 --> 47:17.125
We'd like you to be the godparents.

47:17.208 --> 47:19.250
-I can't believe it, Nando!
-For real?

47:19.333 --> 47:20.791
-Sure!
-Give me a hug.

47:21.625 --> 47:23.000
-I'm so happy, Scheyla!
-Yeah, bro.

47:23.833 --> 47:26.083
I told you he'd tear up.

47:28.416 --> 47:30.166
What do you want for lunch?

47:30.666 --> 47:32.458
It depends on who's cooking.

47:32.541 --> 47:34.416
Just ask the cook to make it.

47:34.500 --> 47:38.375
Well, in that case,
we have a special order for you.

47:38.458 --> 47:40.500
-Oh no.
-Don't give me that look.

47:40.583 --> 47:43.125
You want pizza at this hour?

47:43.208 --> 47:44.375
Who remembers it?

47:44.458 --> 47:45.833
This pizza is dope

47:45.916 --> 47:47.375
Pepperoni and mozzarella

47:47.458 --> 47:49.791
People say it's the best in the favela

47:49.875 --> 47:52.250
Delivery guy done goofed
We went for it

47:52.333 --> 47:54.500
The pizza is good, and Nando has arrived

47:54.583 --> 47:56.250
And Nando has arrived

47:57.666 --> 47:59.583
-I almost forgot.
-Daddy!

48:00.125 --> 48:02.750
For real, what do you want to eat?

48:02.833 --> 48:04.000
Daddy.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.083
Daddy.

48:08.291 --> 48:09.416
Nando!

48:09.500 --> 48:11.458
-We can't have pizza?
-Nando!

48:18.000 --> 48:22.041
The police have tracked down
the criminal and his link to the gang.

48:22.125 --> 48:25.583
This criminal, known as Nando from VA,

48:25.666 --> 48:28.208
is considered one of those responsible

48:28.291 --> 48:32.458
for various crimes related
to drug trafficking and even murder.

48:32.541 --> 48:36.666
A guy like this
should rot in jail for good!

48:36.750 --> 48:38.333
Show him on the screen.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.291
DANGEROUS CRIMINAL
WANTED FOR MURDER AND TRAFFICKING

48:43.583 --> 48:45.708
Your boss doesn't know your name.

48:46.208 --> 48:47.208
I don't care.

48:48.041 --> 48:49.875
Everyone will know who I am.

53:04.083 --> 53:07.833
