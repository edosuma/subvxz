00:14.379 --> 00:16.447
Congratulations,
Silverstream.

00:16.549 --> 00:20.566
You're officially the first
non-Pegasus Wonderbolt.

00:20.753 --> 00:23.487
Really? That is such an honor!

00:23.707 --> 00:26.357
I don't know how to thank
you, Professor Dash!

00:26.613 --> 00:30.127
Easy. You're kicking
off our show right now,

00:30.229 --> 00:32.238
so get up there
and make me proud.

00:33.365 --> 00:36.200
Wait! I don't have my uniform!

00:36.302 --> 00:38.916
Silverstream! Somehow, I
missed a class all year

00:39.004 --> 00:40.668
and the final
is today!

00:40.769 --> 00:43.011
If I don't pass,
I can't graduate!

00:53.558 --> 00:55.519
Whoa. That was weird.

00:55.621 --> 00:58.168
And that's even weirder!

00:59.996 --> 01:01.091
Ah!

01:01.207 --> 01:02.273
Huh?

01:02.361 --> 01:04.595
Uh, this isn't mine.

01:04.697 --> 01:08.353
Waaa! Make it stop!
Make it stop!

01:13.355 --> 01:14.401
Huh?

01:28.318 --> 01:31.453
Good. You have all
answered my summons.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.408
Wait. You mean this
isn't my dream?

01:34.496 --> 01:36.274
Friends must be
dreaming together!

01:36.362 --> 01:37.853
More like a
nightmare.

01:37.941 --> 01:40.673
I know, right? How
do I pick just one?

01:40.761 --> 01:42.494
They all look so good!

01:42.582 --> 01:45.316
That's your version
of a bad dream?

01:45.418 --> 01:47.852
But why did you bring us
here, Headmare Twilight?

01:47.954 --> 01:50.688
I am not Twilight. I am
merely the messenger.

01:50.790 --> 01:52.323
You all must hurry.

01:52.425 --> 01:54.492
The Tree of Harmony needs you!

Lookin' good!

02:43.327 --> 02:44.400
Spike!

02:44.511 --> 02:46.175
I have
horrible news!

02:46.263 --> 02:48.970
What's wrong? Is the Crystal
Empire under attack again?

02:49.058 --> 02:51.798
What? No! We only have
twenty highlighters!

02:51.886 --> 02:52.950
And they're all orange!

02:53.052 --> 02:55.527
How will everycreature
color code their notes?

02:55.933 --> 02:58.472
I'm pretty sure you're the
only one that does that.

02:58.658 --> 03:01.550
Still! Twenty isn't enough
for the new school year!

03:01.638 --> 03:03.942
We've got plenty of
time to order more.

03:04.030 --> 03:06.178
The friendship students
won't be back until...

03:07.800 --> 03:09.433
Uh... now?

03:12.638 --> 03:14.127
Well, this is
a surprise.

03:14.215 --> 03:16.050
Why are you all
here so early?

03:16.272 --> 03:18.488
Did I send out the wrong
back-to-school date?

03:18.576 --> 03:20.340
Oh, we're not
here for school.

03:20.435 --> 03:22.634
Yeah, we're back 'cause
the Tree of Harmony

03:22.738 --> 03:24.457
called us here.

03:25.546 --> 03:27.686
Don't feel bad it
didn't reach out to you.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.414
We kinda have a special
connection with it

03:29.502 --> 03:30.802
after last year.

03:30.926 --> 03:33.541
But the Tree couldn't have
called you. It's gone.

03:33.629 --> 03:35.393
Sombra destroyed it.

03:37.272 --> 03:40.230
Maybe next time, ease in
with those truth bombs.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.486
What about the
Elements of Harmony?

03:42.635 --> 03:44.090
Those are gone too.

03:44.207 --> 03:46.275
But doesn't that mean
the Everfree Forest

03:46.363 --> 03:47.938
will take over Equestria?

03:48.040 --> 03:49.707
We've got that
part under control.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.446
And Sombra won't
be coming back.

03:51.534 --> 03:54.059
So... some good news, right?

03:57.254 --> 03:59.066
Can we see the tree ourselves?

03:59.245 --> 04:01.277
Or... what's left of it?

04:01.481 --> 04:03.320
As long as you promise
to stick together.

04:03.408 --> 04:04.915
The Castle of the
Two Sisters

04:05.003 --> 04:07.261
isn't the safest place,
as you may remember.

04:07.349 --> 04:09.874
Yona not scared of
puckwudgies anymore!

04:09.962 --> 04:13.517
Friends save whole
school from evil Pegasus!

04:13.605 --> 04:15.499
She does have a point.

04:22.247 --> 04:23.753
How could this happen?

04:28.411 --> 04:30.800
If only we hadn't gone
home for summer break,

04:30.950 --> 04:33.167
maybe we could've
saved the Tree!

04:34.787 --> 04:37.021
I wish that Sombra
guy was still around,

04:37.137 --> 04:38.837
so we could teach
him a lesson!

04:38.925 --> 04:42.425
That not bring back tree.
Or Elements of Harmony.

04:43.855 --> 04:47.798
Wait! We all saw and heard
the Tree in our dream, right?

04:47.900 --> 04:51.542
How could it talk to us
if it was really gone?

04:51.737 --> 04:54.173
Maybe, if we close our eyes

04:54.261 --> 04:56.400
and think really strong
friendship thoughts,

04:56.488 --> 04:58.409
the Tree will get better!

04:58.511 --> 05:00.044
I've heard worse
suggestions.

05:08.435 --> 05:10.784
Is it working?

05:11.910 --> 05:13.292
No.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.956
I guess the Tree
really IS gone.

05:16.095 --> 05:18.396
Then we need to do
something to honor it!

05:18.498 --> 05:20.564
Good idea, Gallus.

05:20.666 --> 05:23.534
Hey, maybe that's why
the tree called us!

05:23.667 --> 05:25.829
It must have used the last
of its magic to make sure

05:25.917 --> 05:27.938
we'd come here and
keep its memory alive!

05:28.113 --> 05:29.743
It did say it needed us.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.064
<i>Ocellus!</i>

05:34.574 --> 05:37.486
There you are! The hive
has been worried sick!

05:37.574 --> 05:39.408
Why did you leave
without telling us?

05:39.502 --> 05:41.228
The last time you and
your friends did that,

05:41.316 --> 05:43.597
it almost brought
our kingdoms to war!

05:45.149 --> 05:47.829
Sorry, Thorax. It
was an emergency.

05:47.917 --> 05:50.694
Well, next time, ask
before you run off.

05:50.796 --> 05:52.964
Now c'mon,
let's go home.

05:55.834 --> 05:59.570
Wait! She can't leave!
We have a... Dragon Quest!

05:59.672 --> 06:01.806
But she's not a dragon.

06:02.027 --> 06:03.674
You know what I mean.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.779
This quest for all Yona
friends. Need to help Tree.

06:08.881 --> 06:10.714
And it might take a while.

06:10.816 --> 06:13.312
Can we stay,
Headmare Twilight?

06:18.257 --> 06:21.677
Well, as long you get
permission from your kingdoms,

06:21.765 --> 06:23.127
I suppose it's all right.

06:23.229 --> 06:24.883
You want that permission
slip in triplicate

06:24.970 --> 06:26.359
or is one enough?

06:27.299 --> 06:29.193
What? I like to be prepared.

06:40.779 --> 06:41.864
Yeah!

06:42.815 --> 06:44.038
Ha ha ha ha!

08:06.756 --> 08:08.823
Hey, you're back! Great!

08:09.035 --> 08:10.267
Since I live locally,

08:10.406 --> 08:12.200
I figured I'd do a
little cleaning up

08:12.288 --> 08:13.325
while you were gone.

08:13.413 --> 08:15.005
Give us a headstart, y'know?

08:16.491 --> 08:19.531
Sandbar. Where's the tree?

08:19.638 --> 08:22.325
I got rid of it. To make
room for our memorial.

08:22.413 --> 08:24.081
You did this?

08:24.183 --> 08:27.952
Uh, yeah. That's what you
guys were thinking, right?

08:28.327 --> 08:30.491
So not.

08:30.657 --> 08:34.101
How can we remember the
Tree if it's totally gone?

08:34.193 --> 08:36.437
Oh, it's not gone! Look!

08:37.583 --> 08:39.803
I planted a new Tree!

08:47.698 --> 08:50.999
Sandbar. You know that's
not the same tree, right?

08:51.133 --> 08:52.966
But it's a symbol, you know?

08:53.093 --> 08:54.979
Pony heart in right place.

08:56.179 --> 08:57.396
That doesn't matter!

08:57.484 --> 09:00.357
This cave was supposed
to stay exactly the same,

09:00.445 --> 09:02.497
so future creatures could
come visit and experience

09:02.585 --> 09:04.054
the memory of the Tree!

09:04.142 --> 09:06.910
Sorry, everycreature. I
thought I was helping.

09:07.026 --> 09:09.255
The Tree of Harmony
is a huge part

09:09.343 --> 09:10.687
of Equestrian history.

09:10.775 --> 09:14.241
If we're gonna honor it, we
need to do better than that.

09:14.467 --> 09:17.200
Yeah! Like, with lots of artwork

09:17.288 --> 09:20.278
that represents the
symbolism and deep emotions

09:20.366 --> 09:21.278
of the Tree!

09:21.366 --> 09:22.920
No, it should be a museum,

09:23.008 --> 09:25.364
with all the Tree's
history and artifacts!

09:25.452 --> 09:27.978
Or a really big and
imposing monument,

09:28.080 --> 09:31.452
so everycreature knows how
powerful the Tree was!

09:31.570 --> 09:33.784
I think we should turn
this cave into a place

09:33.886 --> 09:36.422
for creatures to reflect
on the Tree's true gift,

09:36.538 --> 09:38.360
the Elements of Harmony.

09:38.469 --> 09:39.857
Boring.

09:39.959 --> 09:41.091
I like my idea better.

09:41.193 --> 09:43.030
What's more perfect
than ANOTHER tree?

09:43.118 --> 09:44.762
What would Headmare
Twilight want?

09:44.864 --> 09:46.899
Yona! You've been awfully quiet.

09:47.001 --> 09:48.932
Which idea do you like best?

09:49.034 --> 09:51.233
Yona like when
friends not argue.

09:51.321 --> 09:53.501
Maybe friends
listen to each other

09:53.589 --> 09:55.516
and make plan together?

09:56.898 --> 09:58.438
- Nah! - Nah! - Nah!
- Nah! - Nah!

10:02.914 --> 10:05.413
Hey, little guy.
Need a drink?

10:05.501 --> 10:08.545
<i>Step right up,
walk this way!</i>

10:08.633 --> 10:11.789
<i>Welcome to the
one, the only</i>

10:11.891 --> 10:15.793
magical Tree of
Harmony museum!

10:15.895 --> 10:18.462
Come see the
birthplace of the Tree!

10:19.164 --> 10:22.092
Grown from the
tears of a basilisk

10:22.180 --> 10:27.251
and tended day and
night by Pony magicians,

10:27.649 --> 10:32.774
this is truly one of the
wonders of Equestria!

10:32.940 --> 10:36.188
Uh, Gallus? None of
that actually true.

10:36.276 --> 10:38.569
So? Honoring the tree
means giving it a story

10:38.657 --> 10:39.631
that creatures will
care about.

10:39.719 --> 10:41.985
It already has
a great story!

10:42.172 --> 10:44.088
Yeah, but mine
makes more sense.

10:44.190 --> 10:46.493
Whatever, can you
just keep it down?

10:46.587 --> 10:48.792
My sapling doesn't
like the noise.

10:48.894 --> 10:52.463
Good! It doesn't belong in
the Tree's memorial anyway!

10:52.565 --> 10:56.133
And if you think this is great,

10:56.235 --> 11:02.087
just wait until you see the
mystical Cave of Harmony!

11:16.154 --> 11:17.970
What dragon doing?

11:19.728 --> 11:21.994
Making a memorial
statue of the Tree.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.634
When creatures see this,
they'll be super-impressed.

11:26.525 --> 11:28.814
Look like rock, not Tree.

11:28.902 --> 11:30.501
I'm not finished yet!

11:30.636 --> 11:34.718
And honestly? I'm kinda
having a hard time

11:34.806 --> 11:37.040
remembering what the
Tree looked like.

11:37.236 --> 11:39.509
I can't believe I'm
already forgetting.

11:50.589 --> 11:54.925
Hmm. Needs more "loyalty."

11:55.978 --> 11:59.029
Careful, Yona!
It's not dry yet.

11:59.131 --> 12:00.681
What hippogriff
painting?

12:00.769 --> 12:03.134
It's the Tree, silly!

12:05.112 --> 12:09.265
See? These are the emotions
its loss made me feel,

12:09.353 --> 12:11.142
dancing with the representations

12:11.230 --> 12:13.415
of elements of harmony!

12:15.955 --> 12:17.759
Maybe I should label it.

12:19.118 --> 12:22.017
Oops! Sorry!

12:22.262 --> 12:25.783
Oh, no! Brown isn't
an Element of Harmony!

12:31.018 --> 12:34.754
Thanks, Yona! This fountain
is heavier than I thought.

12:42.822 --> 12:45.265
It's for creatures to
look at as they honor

12:45.353 --> 12:48.673
the Tree's memory in quiet
thought and contemplation.

12:50.316 --> 12:52.156
I got some help and
guidance from the counselor

12:52.244 --> 12:54.702
at our Feelings Forum back home.

12:54.790 --> 12:58.070
Only positive energy
will bloom here.

12:58.158 --> 13:00.320
<i>WAIT! You
can't go yet!</i>

13:03.262 --> 13:04.406
Huh?

13:04.494 --> 13:06.070
There's a whole puppet
show of the time

13:06.158 --> 13:07.563
the Tree tested us
in the catacombs

13:07.651 --> 13:09.431
under the School of Friendship!

13:11.303 --> 13:13.033
Hey! Stop!

13:13.837 --> 13:16.626
You can't bring that hunk
of junk into my museum!

13:16.807 --> 13:20.695
It's not for your museum.
It's for my Tree memorial!

13:23.556 --> 13:25.861
So leave it outside!

13:26.005 --> 13:28.408
It BELONGS in here!

13:31.603 --> 13:32.663
Oh!

13:35.160 --> 13:36.486
Ah!

13:39.883 --> 13:41.220
Uh oh.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.830
What did you do?

13:53.645 --> 13:55.579
My meditation garden is ruined!

13:55.695 --> 13:57.695
Why couldn't you have
been more careful?

13:57.783 --> 13:59.540
This never
would've happened

13:59.681 --> 14:01.290
if you all just
listened to me!

14:01.487 --> 14:04.085
And made the Tree some kind
of roadside attraction?

14:04.173 --> 14:06.242
Uh, no thanks!

14:08.441 --> 14:11.273
Headmare Twilight is gonna
be so mad when she sees

14:11.361 --> 14:13.530
what you guys did to
the Cave of Harmony.

14:13.697 --> 14:16.790
Yeah, like some rainbow
art project was better?

14:16.892 --> 14:18.109
Not cool.

14:18.197 --> 14:19.717
It's impressionism!

14:19.876 --> 14:22.205
I'm just glad the Tree
isn't here to see this.

14:22.307 --> 14:24.041
This is all your fault!

14:24.143 --> 14:25.298
I give up!

14:25.665 --> 14:27.023
QUIET!

14:28.447 --> 14:30.853
Friends doing this
the wrong way.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.332
All remembering Tree of
Harmony for what Tree WAS,

14:34.420 --> 14:36.286
not what Tree IS.

14:36.388 --> 14:37.759
You mean gone?

14:37.847 --> 14:42.431
No! Yona mean, even though
Tree not HERE here,

14:42.561 --> 14:45.697
Tree here! In hearts.

14:45.831 --> 14:49.032
Tree made friendship
even closer.

14:49.674 --> 14:53.117
That's right! We ran
away to be together

14:53.205 --> 14:56.970
right above this spot, the
Castle of the Two Sisters!

14:57.058 --> 14:59.007
And later on, the
Tree tested us

14:59.095 --> 15:01.119
to show us we're
stronger as a team.

15:01.207 --> 15:04.508
It DID call us all here.

15:04.923 --> 15:08.719
You mean the Tree of Harmony
lives on in our friendship!

15:08.821 --> 15:12.665
Wow. I can't believe we
just got schooled by a yak.

15:12.858 --> 15:17.486
Yaks know things not forever.
That's why smash and rebuild.

15:17.696 --> 15:20.263
I think we took care
of the smashing part.

15:20.365 --> 15:23.275
Then maybe we should
start building. Together?

15:23.469 --> 15:25.259
Just one problem.

15:25.347 --> 15:28.540
We still haven't decided what
we should do for the Tree.

15:29.376 --> 15:31.492
Yona have idea.

15:37.283 --> 15:39.984
The Tree! Where did
you find it?

15:40.072 --> 15:42.973
Oh, I didn't
move it too far.

15:43.222 --> 15:44.712
It was kinda heavy.

15:44.999 --> 15:48.267
And you're just
mentioning this now.

15:48.861 --> 15:51.812
What important is that
Yona bring back branches

15:51.900 --> 15:53.430
so friends can rebuild!

15:53.595 --> 15:55.533
Rebuild what, exactly?

15:55.629 --> 15:58.549
Ooh, I know! Something
that represents what

15:58.637 --> 16:02.773
the Tree is: the gateway
to our friendship!

16:03.109 --> 16:04.455
Yes!

16:06.402 --> 16:11.005
What Ponies call it?
Clubhome?

16:11.289 --> 16:12.422
A treehouse!

16:12.719 --> 16:14.046
That's a great idea!

16:14.134 --> 16:16.353
I know the tree
would've liked that.

16:16.441 --> 16:17.517
Uh huh!

16:21.941 --> 16:23.470

18:39.195 --> 18:41.463
Well? What
do you think?

18:41.800 --> 18:45.103
It's uh... kinda messy.

18:45.411 --> 18:48.327
Yeah. Like a
bunch of different parts

18:48.415 --> 18:50.342
all smooshed together.

18:50.544 --> 18:52.945
It's just like us!

18:53.244 --> 18:55.779
Yona think it perfect.

18:55.881 --> 18:57.361
Let's give it a try.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.860
Whoa! What's happening?

19:08.994 --> 19:10.517
It looks like magic!

19:10.666 --> 19:13.142
Everycreature, out!

19:48.441 --> 19:51.272
How did that happen?

19:53.566 --> 19:54.815
Because of you.

19:54.911 --> 19:57.184
The spirit of the Tree
house would have perished

19:57.272 --> 19:59.186
without your selfless
deeds and caring.

19:59.274 --> 20:02.375
Whenever you seek
solace, come here.

20:02.495 --> 20:04.509
Your friendship,
and the friendship

20:04.597 --> 20:07.364
of future generations
will always be safe

20:07.506 --> 20:09.386
within these walls.

20:13.209 --> 20:16.161
I felt a burst of magic all
the way over at the school!

20:16.249 --> 20:18.084
Is everycreature OK?

20:18.280 --> 20:21.850
A little confused,
but definitely OK.

20:22.246 --> 20:24.447
Where did
this come from?

20:24.734 --> 20:27.240
We were kinda gonna
ask you the same thing.

20:27.328 --> 20:29.228
It looks like part of
the Tree of Harmony.

20:29.432 --> 20:32.061
But how? I thought
it was destroyed.

20:32.169 --> 20:34.745
It was. But when we
used the broken parts

20:34.834 --> 20:37.082
to build something
new, this happened.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.966
The Tree has always
been good at surprises.

20:41.693 --> 20:43.801
When Starswirl planted
the Tree's seed,

20:43.889 --> 20:45.957
he didn't even know
what it would grow into!

20:46.045 --> 20:47.722
I guess the Tree
is still alive,

20:47.810 --> 20:50.675
changing and adapting to be
whatever Equestria needs.

20:50.763 --> 20:52.474
A cool place
to hang out?

20:52.562 --> 20:54.812
Something tells me
this is more than that.

20:54.900 --> 20:57.435
It seems the Elements of
Harmony may still be with us

20:57.523 --> 20:59.323
in their own way.

20:59.521 --> 21:01.912
That's actually
really reassuring.

21:02.187 --> 21:06.347
But why did the Tree need our
help to become something new?

21:06.435 --> 21:08.792
I'm not sure.
If I had to guess,

21:08.880 --> 21:12.082
I'd say your friendship is
more powerful than you know.

21:12.184 --> 21:17.887
Oh, Yona know. Yona just
need to remind friends.

21:18.029 --> 21:19.989
So, who's going to
give us the tour?

21:23.412 --> 21:25.962
Why don't we all
go in... together?
