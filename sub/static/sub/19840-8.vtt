00:00.520 --> 00:02.960
We know we missed the signs with faith.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.622
<i>Previously on Greenleaf...</i>

00:04.656 --> 00:06.072
So that's why you came
all the way over here,

00:06.096 --> 00:08.173
to tell me this in person...
Mac just wins?

00:08.207 --> 00:11.532
No, I actually came to say
you may have one last shot.

00:11.567 --> 00:13.452
<i>- I'll take it.
- Deputy Mayor Leonard.</i>

00:13.487 --> 00:15.213
- Walk with me.
- Skip.

00:15.247 --> 00:16.813
- What?
- I need a job.

00:16.847 --> 00:18.413
I should've brought along a suitcase.

00:18.447 --> 00:20.365
What you call that?

00:20.400 --> 00:21.965
A losing hand.

00:21.998 --> 00:24.025
Ooh!

00:24.233 --> 00:26.096
Is that the church's money
you lost in there tonight?

00:26.120 --> 00:28.679
- Most definitely.
- Excuse me, Michaela?

00:28.714 --> 00:30.092
I'm a pastor at Calvary Fellowship.

00:30.116 --> 00:31.672
- Where Mr. McCready worked?
- That's right.

00:31.696 --> 00:32.603
What do you want to know?

00:32.658 --> 00:35.127
- Kevin is gay.
- What?

00:35.162 --> 00:37.461
- So, are you happy now?
- No.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.383
If you ever need someone
to talk to about whatever...

00:40.707 --> 00:42.433
- Thanks.
- I saw your uncle.

00:42.467 --> 00:43.969
He came and asked me for a job.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.849
- Don't.
- Whoa, easy, easy.

00:46.882 --> 00:49.729
<i>Man, I gotta drive home
tomorrow and drive right past the lake</i>

00:49.762 --> 00:51.114
<i>where my little sister drowned herself</i>

00:51.138 --> 00:52.769
<i>because of what that man did to her.</i>

00:52.802 --> 00:54.081
<i>You give him a job,</i>

00:54.114 --> 00:56.096
I'll take your ass apart
six ways to Sunday.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.688
- Who are those from?
- Probably Darlene and Vida.

00:58.722 --> 01:00.864
She had mentioned that they would...
What?

01:00.898 --> 01:04.224
- You stay with the family.
- Wait, where are you going?

01:12.737 --> 01:14.271
<i>He did it again.</i>

01:14.306 --> 01:16.864
Honestly, Gigi, I don't think
he ever really stopped.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.551
<i>Then he put his hands down my pants.</i>

01:23.586 --> 01:24.800
<i>I told him I'd tell.</i>

01:24.833 --> 01:26.304
<i>He said no one would believe me.</i>

03:50.913 --> 03:53.983
<i>- Hey.
- What's up?</i>

04:02.272 --> 04:03.935
Covered a lot of accidents.

04:05.056 --> 04:06.942
Cars not half as damaged as that

04:06.976 --> 04:08.315
and people don't walk away.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.269
I know.

04:12.864 --> 04:14.046
What?

04:19.007 --> 04:20.958
Nothing. I'm lucky to be alive.

04:26.206 --> 04:29.277
Praise God. Where have you been?

04:29.312 --> 04:31.326
We've been calling and calling.

04:31.359 --> 04:33.309
- You all right?
- I was in a car accident.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.941
- What?
- Are you hurt?

04:34.975 --> 04:37.213
- I'm fine.
- She's lucky to be alive.

04:37.247 --> 04:39.644
- We don't believe in luck.
- Then she must have

04:39.679 --> 04:41.469
her own private angel
following her around.

04:41.503 --> 04:43.037
That, I don't doubt.

04:47.984 --> 04:49.596
I had the car towed to Sanderson's,

04:49.630 --> 04:51.708
and so Darius came to pick me up.

04:51.743 --> 04:53.277
Well, how gallant of him.

04:53.819 --> 04:55.548
First Lady, Bishop.

04:55.987 --> 04:57.116
Nash.

04:57.989 --> 05:00.092
And you must be Sophia.

05:00.127 --> 05:02.492
- Thank you for bringing her home.
- Anytime.

05:02.526 --> 05:04.188
Happy belated birthday, by the way.

05:04.223 --> 05:06.845
Thank you. What happened?

05:06.878 --> 05:09.725
Thank you, Daddy.
A deer ran across the road.

05:09.758 --> 05:11.484
And I just... I swerved to avoid it.

05:11.518 --> 05:14.423
- Well, you're home safe now.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:15.102 --> 05:16.924
We don't want to keep you further.

05:20.345 --> 05:21.467
Yeah.

05:21.502 --> 05:23.387
I should probably be going.

05:24.182 --> 05:26.747
- Call you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

05:26.781 --> 05:27.900
There you go.

05:29.053 --> 05:30.683
- Thank you.
- Okay, bye.

05:33.661 --> 05:35.419
Nice home.

05:35.453 --> 05:36.731
I'll walk you out.

05:36.765 --> 05:38.011
Thank you.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.147
Your daughter's
been worried sick about you.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.259
She knew where you were headed.

05:47.292 --> 05:48.827
Well, I didn't get there.

05:48.861 --> 05:50.491
I think that's for the best.

05:50.525 --> 05:53.019
Understood. I understand.

05:55.677 --> 05:56.955
If you ask me, Gigi,

05:56.988 --> 05:58.875
I don't think that just any deer.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.074
I think that deer
was sent by God to keep you

06:02.108 --> 06:05.210
from doing something
that you'd have had to regret.

06:05.663 --> 06:06.974
Be advised.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.930
Night, Daddy. Night, Mom.

06:12.369 --> 06:13.369
Good night.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.769
Do you want a heating pad or something?

06:20.155 --> 06:21.498
An ice pack?

06:21.532 --> 06:23.408
No, thank you, baby.

06:24.444 --> 06:26.426
Thank you, though.

06:26.828 --> 06:29.242
A lot of times it doesn't hurt
until the next day.

06:29.276 --> 06:31.033
That's what Dad told me
when I got my car.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.387
Well, if I wake up with whiplash,

06:32.411 --> 06:34.329
you'll be the first person I contact.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.569
Mom.

06:37.262 --> 06:38.335
What?

06:38.369 --> 06:41.465
You can't keep freaking me out.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.673
I have my own life I have to live,

06:43.708 --> 06:45.913
but I have to live it with you.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.313
Just stop being crazy, please.

06:48.347 --> 06:50.584
- I'm not being crazy.
- If you were driving so fast

06:50.619 --> 06:52.889
that swerving to not hit
a deer totaled the car,

06:52.923 --> 06:54.361
that's too fast!

06:56.250 --> 06:58.041
What if you died?

06:58.075 --> 07:00.737
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

07:03.802 --> 07:06.993
I know it drives you nuts
that Mac's free,

07:07.953 --> 07:09.944
but let it go.

07:10.413 --> 07:11.608
Please.

07:11.643 --> 07:13.208
I don't know that I can.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.760
And I really don't know that I should.

07:21.466 --> 07:23.127
Then what's gonna happen?

07:24.794 --> 07:27.800
It is what it is. What will you do?

07:27.834 --> 07:29.752
I don't know what to say, honey.

07:29.786 --> 07:31.704
I don't want to lie to you

07:32.060 --> 07:34.616
or pretend like it's all just over.

07:34.649 --> 07:37.239
It's not.
We all have our crosses to bear.

07:37.273 --> 07:39.095
And you're becoming mine.

07:46.658 --> 07:48.951
I'll drive slower, honey.
I'll drive slower.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.126
I'll drive sl... come on, baby.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.471
Come here, come on.

08:00.223 --> 08:01.789
That's the best I can do.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.471
Okay.

08:14.661 --> 08:18.919
Let's try this one more time,
only let's not pee on Mommy.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.582
I know you don't like this, but listen,

08:22.616 --> 08:25.750
no one's ever gonna love you
the way that I do.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.886
The looks you're gonna get
from people around the world

08:28.920 --> 08:32.054
walking down the street,
you're gonna long for these days

08:32.087 --> 08:35.254
when somebody saw you
for who you truly are,

08:35.287 --> 08:37.876
just a helpless little child of God.

08:39.192 --> 08:42.453
Yeah? Yeah?

08:42.486 --> 08:45.258
Let's get you dressed.

08:46.358 --> 08:47.830
Come on.

08:56.394 --> 08:58.037
Hey, Jabari. What's up?

08:58.664 --> 08:59.723
Too late to call?

08:59.757 --> 09:01.749
<i>Not at all. What's up?</i>

09:01.783 --> 09:03.071
What are the chances I can get you

09:03.095 --> 09:05.795
on a flight to Nashville tomorrow?

09:06.171 --> 09:07.797
<i>I know it's short notice.</i>

09:07.832 --> 09:09.876
Yeah, I-I would have to see...

09:09.911 --> 09:11.230
I seriously know it's last minute.

09:11.254 --> 09:12.725
If you can't, don't worry about it.

09:12.758 --> 09:14.933
No. Tell me, what's going on?

09:14.967 --> 09:17.138
<i>I got a group coming in
from LA tomorrow.</i>

09:17.172 --> 09:19.784
They're gonna be here for
a few days writing, recording.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.599
I should have thought
to call you sooner.

09:21.633 --> 09:24.297
<i>It just hit me now that you
and them might be a fit.</i>

09:24.993 --> 09:29.302
Um... well, let me see
if I can figure something out.

09:29.824 --> 09:32.159
Can I have till the morning
to try to make it work?

09:32.193 --> 09:34.143
Yeah, yeah, just let me know.

09:34.176 --> 09:36.415
There's a 3:30 flight.

09:36.448 --> 09:38.395
You could make it in time
to have dinner with us.

09:39.232 --> 09:41.151
Okay.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.191
I'll see what I can do.

09:43.712 --> 09:44.991
Why didn't you tell me?

09:45.024 --> 09:46.590
I'm telling you now.

09:46.624 --> 09:48.154
Now that it's too late.

09:48.897 --> 09:51.582
What kind of grown-ass man,
minister of the gospel,

09:51.616 --> 09:53.566
gets messed up in this kind
of shady foolishness?

09:53.601 --> 09:55.519
Poker? Does Tasha know?

09:55.552 --> 09:56.797
I don't know.

09:56.832 --> 09:58.238
I bet she does.

09:58.272 --> 10:00.062
She probably taught him how to play.

10:00.095 --> 10:02.973
The two of them. Bonnie and Clyde.

10:03.008 --> 10:05.086
I'm gonna make this right, baby.

10:05.463 --> 10:06.622
How?

10:06.656 --> 10:07.784
You just told me that the man

10:07.808 --> 10:09.032
emptied the church's bank account.

10:09.056 --> 10:11.550
That's not only sin, it's fraud.

10:11.584 --> 10:14.397
What do we have to show
for the past six months?

10:14.431 --> 10:15.837
Nothing.

10:15.872 --> 10:17.341
Knew I should've said something

10:17.374 --> 10:18.877
when I found that money on the floor.

10:18.912 --> 10:20.349
What money?

10:20.383 --> 10:22.653
There was a $100 bill
lying on the floor here.

10:22.687 --> 10:25.341
- How does that happen?
- Why didn't you tell me?

10:25.376 --> 10:27.294
Seriously, Jacob?

10:28.695 --> 10:29.927
I'm gonna figure something out.

10:29.951 --> 10:32.156
You better, and it had better not be

10:32.191 --> 10:33.991
you crawling back
with your tail between your legs

10:34.015 --> 10:37.328
to that mansion and that
sneering-ass mama of yours.

10:39.330 --> 10:40.605
I wasn't gonna say that.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.893
You think Elder Robinson
will be strong enough

10:54.917 --> 10:57.539
to make it to service this morning?

10:57.573 --> 11:00.387
- We still have his coat.
- Let's say yes, indeed.

11:00.421 --> 11:03.521
I'll get it.

11:04.389 --> 11:06.024
Who is that now?

11:07.269 --> 11:10.851
Just... Sophia again.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.539
Probably with some fresh mama drama.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.714
You know, that new scarf I got you

11:20.121 --> 11:22.210
would look straight heavenly...

11:22.874 --> 11:24.802
with that outfit.

11:24.836 --> 11:27.287
It's none of my business,
but what kind of niece

11:27.312 --> 11:28.623
calls her uncle so often?

11:28.657 --> 11:29.806
Seems like every day.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.726
The kind with a checked out father

11:31.760 --> 11:34.372
a crank for a mother,
and no one in the family

11:34.406 --> 11:36.942
who treats her like
she's as smart as she is.

11:36.976 --> 11:39.471
So, she's some kind of genius?

11:39.504 --> 11:43.311
Look at that.
You see how beautiful that is?

11:43.984 --> 11:45.614
Almost as beautiful as you.

11:47.632 --> 11:49.934
Look, I'll have her back
it down if it's bothering you.

11:49.967 --> 11:52.685
I just like to be there
for her if she needs me.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.861
No, you do what you need to do.

11:54.896 --> 11:57.550
I don't come between folks and family.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.744
It's just a bit much, that's all.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.094
You don't believe me, do you?

12:06.127 --> 12:08.853
- I believe you.
- So, what's the problem?

12:08.895 --> 12:10.813
I knew who you were when we met.

12:10.847 --> 12:13.340
- Meaning what?
- What people said.

12:13.374 --> 12:15.802
The hoops you were gonna have
to jump through, I knew.

12:17.822 --> 12:20.849
And I'm grateful the way you've always
taken me at face value.

12:21.421 --> 12:22.421
I mean it.

12:22.622 --> 12:24.540
Then make it easier.

12:26.206 --> 12:27.516
I love you.

12:30.685 --> 12:31.685
I love you, too.

12:37.597 --> 12:40.155
Then tell that girl
to Kumbaya with her friends

12:40.189 --> 12:42.236
and figure her out life
like a normal teenage girl.

12:42.270 --> 12:44.795
I just said I'll do that.

12:44.829 --> 12:45.829
Thank you.

12:47.741 --> 12:50.619
- And don't forget the coat.
- "And don't forget the"...

13:06.300 --> 13:09.658
Here, I'm gonna leave her a message.

13:09.692 --> 13:12.609
I don't want to go into worship
with this hanging between us.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.362
<i>Hello?</i>

13:30.395 --> 13:31.865
Hey.

13:32.462 --> 13:34.681
I need you to stop calling.

13:34.715 --> 13:36.633
My mom has gone freaking schizo.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.489
We got into a fight and she hit me.

13:38.523 --> 13:40.633
Hon, I'm sorry to hear that, but...

13:40.667 --> 13:42.662
I just need a place to crash.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.108
I can't give you that.
Not right now, anyway.

13:46.139 --> 13:47.139
<i>Please.</i>

13:49.235 --> 13:50.930
I don't have anyone else.

13:52.403 --> 13:54.400
I can't. I'm sorry.

14:08.504 --> 14:12.118
Come on, now.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.678
Whoo-hoo!

14:14.712 --> 14:16.055
Come on, Calvary!

14:17.784 --> 14:20.726
Are we gonna let God's light
shine today?

14:22.316 --> 14:23.316
Whoo!

14:26.115 --> 14:28.129
Let's go, y'all.

14:59.873 --> 15:01.695
Hey!

15:37.345 --> 15:38.623
Whoo!

15:44.737 --> 15:48.226
Pastor. Sorry to interrupt.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.334
Not at all, brother.
Just getting my amp on.

15:50.369 --> 15:53.561
Gotta get that energy up.
I know you feel me.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.190
But perhaps you don't.

15:56.224 --> 15:58.047
Have you got a plan or something?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.816
- Plan for what?
- How we're gonna deal with this.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.978
Deal with what? You seem worried.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.377
I don't like to see you this way.

16:03.411 --> 16:05.041
The money, brother. The church's money.

16:05.076 --> 16:07.313
- That's all taken care of.
- How?

16:07.347 --> 16:09.137
Did Bass Reeves make a trip
to see Branson

16:09.171 --> 16:11.600
- since I saw you last?
- No.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.584
But Basie Skanks is about
to make a withdrawal

16:13.618 --> 16:15.921
out of the bank of Heaven
and set things right.

16:15.955 --> 16:19.953
Look and learn! Whoo!

16:23.282 --> 16:25.649
Unfit to be looked at by
the eyes of God,

16:25.683 --> 16:27.376
I know it in my heart.

16:27.410 --> 16:29.328
That's all you gotta do is say it.

16:29.362 --> 16:32.049
Just cop to the truth of it and say it.

16:32.082 --> 16:34.064
You're in sin. Just say it. I'm in sin!

16:34.098 --> 16:35.856
I'm in sin!

16:35.891 --> 16:38.544
Now, do you understand
what's at stake if you don't?

16:38.578 --> 16:40.496
If you keep this
so-called secret to yourself?

16:40.531 --> 16:44.560
Your soul, brothers
and sisters, your soul.

16:44.594 --> 16:49.168
How I... how I pray!

16:49.201 --> 16:51.376
No, no, no, no, no.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.055
I pray for all y'all nightly,
calling out,

16:55.090 --> 16:58.991
rending my clothes,
begging God to make you see.

16:59.025 --> 17:01.679
- You gotta say it, I'm in sin!
- I'm in sin!

17:01.714 --> 17:03.599
Anybody who won't confess,

17:03.634 --> 17:04.952
how do they think
they'll ever get saved?

17:04.976 --> 17:07.631
They won't! They flat-out won't!

17:07.665 --> 17:10.575
Now, what I want to ask you
to do right now,

17:10.608 --> 17:12.682
and only if you feel it...

17:14.724 --> 17:16.559
dig real deep down.

17:17.118 --> 17:22.255
Dig real deep down and sow
a seed of faith this morning.

17:22.289 --> 17:25.007
Now, I'm not talking
about no flaxseeds, no.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.598
I'm not talking about
no lettuce seeds, no.

17:27.633 --> 17:30.734
I'm not talking about no
small, tiny seeds, no.

17:30.768 --> 17:34.766
I'm talking a beanstalk seed of faith!

17:36.496 --> 17:39.278
And I promise you, God gonna bless you

17:39.312 --> 17:41.573
with a harvest like you've never seen.

17:41.607 --> 17:44.782
We're gonna be reaping
beanstalks up in Triumph, amen.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.448
Amen, amen.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.143
I told you before I started

17:48.178 --> 17:50.128
this wasn't gonna be no regular service.

17:50.162 --> 17:52.976
No, we getting "Skanktified" up in here.

17:53.010 --> 17:55.504
Amen! Amen!

17:55.537 --> 17:59.228
And it's not for me. This is not for me.

17:59.698 --> 18:01.712
- This is for Jesus.
- Yes!

18:01.746 --> 18:04.528
Give it up for Jesus! Amen, amen.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.668
Amen!

18:07.473 --> 18:09.040
Now, a lot of pastors this morning,

18:09.073 --> 18:12.399
I know, given the reading for the day,

18:12.433 --> 18:14.704
they're preaching the wages of sin,

18:14.737 --> 18:18.319
and sometimes, sometimes,
that's what folk need to hear.

18:19.728 --> 18:21.615
But I want to talk about the gift,

18:21.648 --> 18:24.655
the gift on the other side
of that equation,

18:24.689 --> 18:28.495
<i>and our God who never stops giving,</i>

18:28.529 --> 18:30.575
never stops reaching out.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.382
He never stops reaching out
his hand saying, "Take it."

18:34.416 --> 18:38.031
Can you feel the presence of the Lord?

18:38.909 --> 18:41.710
He's here! He's here!

18:41.744 --> 18:45.838
And he's reaching out his hand to you
and he's saying, "Just take it."

18:45.872 --> 18:51.534
Now, to sin... means to turn away.

18:51.568 --> 18:54.189
To repent just means to turn back.

18:54.223 --> 18:57.101
God is holding out His hand
to you right now,

18:57.136 --> 19:00.238
and he's saying, "Turn back
from where you're headed"

19:00.272 --> 19:01.934
and walk with me!

19:02.375 --> 19:04.042
Walk with me, and I know!

19:04.293 --> 19:06.384
I know the road is long and hard road,

19:06.879 --> 19:08.848
"but we can get where
we're going together!"

19:08.883 --> 19:10.093
I feel him.

19:11.759 --> 19:15.821
I feel God's holy spirit
coming on me right now!

19:15.855 --> 19:19.660
Coming on me right now
with bright wings!

19:19.685 --> 19:20.718
Yes!

19:20.753 --> 19:22.946
Setting down upon me from above.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.420
If you feel it too...

19:25.600 --> 19:27.332
let me hear you say say amen.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.299
Say amen! Say amen!

19:29.335 --> 19:30.549
Hallelujah.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.845
Whoo! Yeah, say amen!

19:33.880 --> 19:35.349
- Say amen!
- Thank you, father.

19:35.383 --> 19:38.517
Hallelujah! Amen!

19:38.550 --> 19:40.913
- Amen.
- Whoo!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.616
So it's okay if I go to the studio?

19:43.641 --> 19:44.849
What's happening there?

19:44.883 --> 19:46.935
Isaiah and the band
are having a rehearsal.

19:46.970 --> 19:49.089
- Did you finish your homework?
- Mostly.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.809
What, you want me to lie?
I don't want to fall into sin.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.271
Be back by 9:00 sharp.

19:52.304 --> 19:55.887
- Okay. Bye, bye, bye, bye.
- See you, sweetie.

19:55.921 --> 19:58.180
Where's she going?

19:59.056 --> 20:01.327
Can you believe that man?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.481
Telling everyone confess
while he's up there

20:03.505 --> 20:05.103
knowing what he's done?

20:05.688 --> 20:07.214
I got an idea.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.472
I'm not sure I want us
to come back to this church,

20:09.497 --> 20:10.898
let alone helping to lead it?

20:10.933 --> 20:12.639
This is a spiritual danger zone.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.447
Hear what I just said?

20:15.464 --> 20:16.850
You have an idea. What is it?

20:17.366 --> 20:19.160
It's gonna be kind of expensive.

20:19.785 --> 20:24.402
Money is cheap. Freedom is expensive.
What's the plan?

20:25.082 --> 20:26.491
We'll take the money
that my parent's gave us,

20:26.515 --> 20:29.330
and we'll use it for something
that's ours.

20:33.587 --> 20:37.426
- My goodness.
- I know.

20:37.459 --> 20:40.095
- How'd it go with the Saints?
- Great.

20:40.129 --> 20:42.140
As soon as she picked him up
to bring him to the kids,

20:42.164 --> 20:44.936
- he fell right asleep.
- And stayed that way the whole time.

20:44.994 --> 20:49.184
Okay, that's kind
of massively adorable, just like you.

20:49.218 --> 20:50.880
My goodness.
Did anyone take pictures?

20:50.913 --> 20:53.883
- Lots. I'll text you some.
- Good, thank you.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.082
So, what's next, Preacher Lady?

20:56.797 --> 20:58.699
You seem like you're in a good mood.

20:59.836 --> 21:01.787
I'm getting there.

21:01.820 --> 21:04.250
We're taking him back to East Meadow.

21:04.284 --> 21:06.138
- Okay.
- Good.

21:06.172 --> 21:08.507
What restaurant am I meeting
you and Darius at?

21:08.540 --> 21:09.467
Farm & Table.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.058
Sounds good. Drive safe.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.827
- Ma'am.
- Sir.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.180
Hey, man, what you think
about this place?

21:26.519 --> 21:29.945
It's got a pool. No laundry, though.

21:29.979 --> 21:32.249
Yeah, we gotta have on-site laundry.

21:33.851 --> 21:35.642
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:35.676 --> 21:37.817
- Nice singing today.
- Thank you.

21:37.851 --> 21:39.545
He knew his mama was up there.

21:39.579 --> 21:41.152
He smiled every time you soloed.

21:43.675 --> 21:45.497
Kevie, I need to ask a favor.

21:45.531 --> 21:46.745
Okay.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.999
Can I go to Nashville?

21:49.583 --> 21:51.920
- When?
- In a few hours.

21:51.954 --> 21:54.221
But I would be back late Tuesday

21:54.255 --> 21:56.277
or Wednesday if it worked.

21:56.312 --> 21:57.767
Sweetie, I don't even have
an apartment yet.

21:57.791 --> 21:59.736
You could stay at the house.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.826
- Look, I know it's short...
- You know what, no problem.

22:01.850 --> 22:03.744
And I know it's Jabari, but...

22:03.769 --> 22:04.824
That works, actually.

22:07.977 --> 22:09.099
Are you sure?

22:09.133 --> 22:12.139
Yeah, yeah, If your mom's cool
with it, I'm cool with it.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.169
- Go for it.
- Thank you.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.850
No problem.

22:17.884 --> 22:20.282
Guess what?

22:20.315 --> 22:23.578
Mama's gonna go write some songs.

22:23.612 --> 22:26.874
Now you be a good little angel.
You listen to your daddy.

22:26.908 --> 22:32.752
He's the best. Seriously, Kevin, thanks.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.409
Yeah.

22:39.867 --> 22:41.081
You got it.

22:46.651 --> 22:48.630
I am gonna go reheat that chicken.

22:48.664 --> 22:50.521
Sounds good.

22:50.555 --> 22:52.473
Pastor Kenny was on one today.

22:52.507 --> 22:55.257
Wish he'd have reined himself
in an hour or so early.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.014
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.874
<i>- This is Robert.
- Mr. McCready.</i>

23:02.908 --> 23:05.913
Yes, Mr. Leonard, you don't
usually do business on a Sunday.

23:05.948 --> 23:07.770
<i>Yeah, I'm making an exception.</i>

23:07.804 --> 23:09.497
About what?

23:09.531 --> 23:14.073
<i>That thing we talked about?
Not gonna happen.</i>

23:14.107 --> 23:15.961
I thought we had an understanding.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.817
<i>I know you did.</i>

23:17.852 --> 23:19.770
<i>But I'm already getting pushback.</i>

23:19.803 --> 23:22.073
<i>I've got plans, and I can't be hampered</i>

23:22.107 --> 23:25.638
<i>dragging your sick-looking
ass alongside me.</i>

23:26.847 --> 23:28.314
Did she do this?

23:28.347 --> 23:31.832
<i>Did who do what? You did it to yourself.</i>

23:31.867 --> 23:36.049
<i>Followed your demon.
Now please, lose my number.</i>

23:43.164 --> 23:44.164
Who was that?

23:47.261 --> 23:48.891
None of your business.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.761
Excuse me?

23:53.701 --> 23:56.516
Who the hell are you to always
be asking somebody questions?

23:56.727 --> 23:58.796
You've never done anything wrong?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.493
I never said I was perfect.

24:01.527 --> 24:07.126
Perfect? You are the most
bottom shelf, off-brand piece

24:07.159 --> 24:09.780
of rotten old ass
I've ever laid hands on.

24:13.047 --> 24:14.103
Get out.

24:17.398 --> 24:20.725
- Don't do this, please.
- I said... get out.

24:20.864 --> 24:22.325
- Robert.
- Get out!

24:22.358 --> 24:25.990
- God, Robert, don't do this.
- Go!

25:01.750 --> 25:03.253
<i>Mr. McCready?</i>

25:03.286 --> 25:05.877
It's me. You still need a place to stay?

25:06.999 --> 25:08.180
I worked it out.

25:48.617 --> 25:50.890
How was that?

25:51.383 --> 25:54.133
- I loved it.
- Cool.

25:54.167 --> 25:57.716
The "Brick by brick" part
might have been a little flat,

25:57.750 --> 25:59.667
but you can always punch in.

26:00.433 --> 26:03.278
So, yeah. Cool.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.832
You wanna do it?

26:07.867 --> 26:10.264
We could just get that now and move on.

26:10.298 --> 26:11.705
Yeah.

26:16.954 --> 26:19.545
Yeah. Yeah, hold on.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.080
- Talk to you a second?
- Yeah.

26:41.497 --> 26:44.504
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

26:44.537 --> 26:48.024
You know what you did.
And in front of all them?

26:48.057 --> 26:49.378
- What do you...
- Babe, you asked...

26:49.402 --> 26:51.427
And now you're interrupting me?

26:52.186 --> 26:54.904
You must forgot who I am?

26:54.937 --> 26:56.343
I brought you in that room.

26:56.765 --> 27:00.471
You sit there, you watch. That's it!

27:00.504 --> 27:02.806
And if I ask what you think,

27:02.841 --> 27:06.519
you think it was great or you shut up!

27:06.900 --> 27:08.402
You understand me?

27:09.361 --> 27:10.806
- I got it.
- Do you got it?

27:10.841 --> 27:12.279
Got it.

27:17.432 --> 27:19.062
All right, let's run it.

27:30.935 --> 27:33.558
Hey, can you come get me?

27:33.591 --> 27:35.413
<i>Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

27:35.446 --> 27:38.005
Thank you. Hurry.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.870
So, that's the solution.

27:58.327 --> 28:00.654
We pay the debt. You give us Triumph II.

28:00.688 --> 28:03.343
That way, the money gets replaced,
and you don't go to jail.

28:03.376 --> 28:05.125
No one has to know.

28:06.225 --> 28:08.142
Well, look who got some nutsack.

28:08.175 --> 28:10.318
- Basie, man, come on.
- Don't come on, Basie, man me.

28:10.352 --> 28:11.949
- I'm trying to help you.
- Help?

28:11.984 --> 28:15.836
- Yes.
- I took you from worst to first.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.779
Been going out
and building you a church.

28:17.813 --> 28:21.183
- This how you gonna do me?
- What other options do you have?

28:21.940 --> 28:26.067
Look... nobody has ever
appreciated anybody

28:26.101 --> 28:27.954
as much I appreciate
what you've done for me.

28:27.989 --> 28:30.258
I told you, you're like a brother to me.
I mean it.

28:30.292 --> 28:33.458
Enough of your silver tongue.
God'll get his money back.

28:33.493 --> 28:35.378
- You're delusional.
- No, you delusional

28:35.413 --> 28:37.235
thinking anybody
gonna come within five feet

28:37.269 --> 28:39.731
<i>of working with you again
after the way you cut me like this.</i>

28:39.764 --> 28:41.651
And where you gonna get that
kinda money anyway,

28:41.684 --> 28:43.122
to cover my ass and then some?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.635
- We have it already.
- Seriously?

28:45.669 --> 28:47.922
Yes. It was a wedding present.

28:47.955 --> 28:50.129
I'm astounded
by the depth of the betrayal,

28:50.164 --> 28:51.730
the underhanded way you cut me.

28:51.764 --> 28:54.029
- I'm just astounded!
- Basie!

28:54.424 --> 28:56.530
Now, you and I both know

28:56.564 --> 28:57.820
you mess with black people's money,

28:57.844 --> 28:59.729
they gonna rise up and take it back.

29:00.097 --> 29:01.586
That's the God's truth.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.697
Now, you just stop dreaming.

29:03.731 --> 29:06.066
You let us fill that bank account.

29:06.099 --> 29:09.010
You and Tasha can leave us
the deed to the land,

29:09.044 --> 29:12.305
and you walk free and clear.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.705
You keep your church, and we get ours.

29:21.536 --> 29:23.134
That's the deal, brother.

29:32.051 --> 29:34.929
<i>That's correct!</i>

29:34.963 --> 29:36.113
<i>Welcome to...</i>

29:36.147 --> 29:37.424
How about...

29:40.979 --> 29:44.391
- You've got opinions.
- I have taste.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.304
There's nothing else good to watch.

29:52.338 --> 29:54.160
Five hundred channels and change

29:54.193 --> 29:57.327
and you say
there's nothing else to watch.

30:00.197 --> 30:01.603
Explore.

30:07.664 --> 30:09.712
Have you ever seen "Imitation of Life"?

30:10.379 --> 30:12.224
No. What's that?

30:12.249 --> 30:14.519
It's a movie. A good movie.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.295
- Old?
- Not old, classic.

30:21.935 --> 30:22.935
Trust me.

30:41.365 --> 30:44.206
She didn't know where I was,
now I don't know where she is.

30:45.135 --> 30:46.988
Karma's a bitch?

30:47.021 --> 30:49.004
She's probably driving
and ignored her phone

30:49.038 --> 30:51.148
like she's supposed to.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.804
Yeah, she is kind of
stunningly well-behaved

30:53.838 --> 30:56.877
for a kid who has every right
to be an absolute mess.

30:56.910 --> 30:59.660
Seems like you're doing a great job.

30:59.694 --> 31:02.302
From the little I saw.

31:02.829 --> 31:06.667
- You folks ready to order?
- We're waiting for one more.

31:06.701 --> 31:07.933
Of course.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.796
Why don't you call her
and see if she pulls over.

31:10.830 --> 31:13.814
No, no, no, I don't want to be
that nagging mother.

31:14.648 --> 31:16.652
She'll be here.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.659
- What took you so long?
- My phone died, I got lost.

31:23.693 --> 31:25.419
I've been waiting here forever.

31:25.453 --> 31:28.651
I'm sorry, I'm not from here.
Are you okay?

31:28.685 --> 31:30.347
I'll tell you when we get in the car.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.888
- Wait.
- Shh, it's okay.

32:58.922 --> 33:00.296
Get off.

33:00.330 --> 33:03.112
- Just kiss me.
- Get off me, no.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.874
- Just... just... just...
- Stop.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.390
- You're hurting me!
- Just listen to me.

33:07.414 --> 33:08.565
Stop!

33:09.779 --> 33:11.792
Get off me!

33:11.826 --> 33:15.184
No! Get off!

34:17.889 --> 34:20.704
Rough day?

34:20.737 --> 34:24.004
Rough year. Years.

34:25.888 --> 34:27.549
I don't know.

34:29.376 --> 34:31.455
Any luck finding a new place yet?

34:31.803 --> 34:34.079
No. No.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.266
It's okay fine for now,
with Charity coming and going.

34:38.518 --> 34:41.521
Sooner or later, gotta find my own.

34:42.304 --> 34:44.274
There is nothing out there.

34:47.871 --> 34:52.670
You know, one way to find a good place

34:52.704 --> 34:56.510
is to put up an old-fashioned
"Wanted To Rent" ad in the paper

34:56.543 --> 35:00.677
or on Craigslist, whatever.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.227
See, there's all these old people

35:02.252 --> 35:04.377
with cool guest homes and stuff,

35:04.410 --> 35:06.329
and they don't want to be
legally required

35:06.362 --> 35:08.409
to just rent them out to just anybody,

35:08.442 --> 35:14.137
so they don't... they don't
advertise, but they'll reply.

35:15.995 --> 35:17.182
Thanks for the tip.

35:19.514 --> 35:20.514
Yeah.

35:25.023 --> 35:29.529
- You want another?
- No, no, no, I'm good.

35:31.696 --> 35:34.074
Little man's gonna wake me up
at 3:00 a.m., I know it.

35:36.535 --> 35:40.247
Yeah. I guess I'm good, too.

35:42.891 --> 35:43.912
Hey...

35:46.922 --> 35:49.005
thanks for being so nice to me.

35:50.538 --> 35:51.592
Through all this.

35:54.265 --> 35:55.446
It's been...

36:01.145 --> 36:02.644
Just thanks.

36:08.688 --> 36:09.838
Of course.

36:51.084 --> 36:54.446
- I'm sorry about this.
- Stop it, don't be silly.

36:55.115 --> 36:58.505
If she hit traffic, okay, but to...
I mean to not pick up her phone.

36:58.539 --> 37:00.969
Are we still waiting on our third?

37:03.972 --> 37:06.275
You know what, no,
I'm just gonna order for her.

37:06.309 --> 37:08.291
- Okay.
- Why don't you go first?

37:08.325 --> 37:11.010
Now what do we have?

37:13.472 --> 37:15.134
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

37:18.884 --> 37:20.227
What do you want?

37:20.680 --> 37:22.818
<i>Should've left it alone, Gigi.</i>

37:23.141 --> 37:25.512
<i>- Left what alone?
- Skip Leonard!</i>

37:25.994 --> 37:27.307
What? What are you talking about?

37:27.331 --> 37:31.244
- You should've left it alone.
- What have you done?

37:31.278 --> 37:32.587
You think there's not
gonna be consequences,

37:32.611 --> 37:35.554
- messing in my life?
- Mac, what have you done?

37:35.987 --> 37:39.473
<i>- You should've left it alone.
- Mac?</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:42.528
Mac.

37:46.499 --> 37:49.797
- Everything okay?
- I don't know. I gotta go.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.896
- You want me to...
- No, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

37:59.687 --> 38:02.278
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Roberto?</i>

38:02.947 --> 38:05.186
<i>- It's Sophia's mom.
- Hey, Ms. Greenleaf.</i>

38:05.220 --> 38:06.946
Hey, have you heard from Sophia?

38:06.981 --> 38:09.052
<i>No, she dropped
me off a couple hours ago,</i>

38:09.086 --> 38:10.755
<i>maybe three hours ago.</i>

38:10.788 --> 38:13.234
<i>- Is everything okay?
- You know, I don't know, honey,</i>

38:13.291 --> 38:14.378
but if you hear from her,

38:14.411 --> 38:15.386
will you have her call me, please?

38:15.420 --> 38:16.861
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.</i>

38:27.019 --> 38:28.584
- Where is she?
- Who?

38:28.618 --> 38:30.761
Where is she? Sophia!

38:30.794 --> 38:33.321
- Get out of my house.
- Tell me where she is.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.789
- Tell me where my daughter is!
- Who knows?

38:35.814 --> 38:37.325
Maybe she can't stand
to be around you either.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.300
This has nothing to do with her Mac.

38:39.334 --> 38:41.709
- This is between you and me.
- No, this is between you and you.

38:41.733 --> 38:43.459
I ain't done nothing to nobody.

38:43.494 --> 38:47.299
Yeah, you did. You hurt those girls.
You are sick!

38:47.334 --> 38:52.440
Danielle and Vida and Faith!
Did you hurt my daughter?

38:52.474 --> 38:54.211
- I didn't hurt anybody!
- Yes, you did.

38:54.245 --> 38:56.780
And you best get the hell
out of my house!

38:56.835 --> 38:59.585
No! Where is she? Where's my daughter?

38:59.619 --> 39:01.730
Stupid bitch!

39:07.139 --> 39:09.345
You wanna play, little girl?

39:09.379 --> 39:13.185
You wanna play? Come on! Let's play!

39:20.354 --> 39:22.881
Come here!

39:22.914 --> 39:25.600
- Come here!
- Mac! No! No!

39:37.166 --> 39:41.321
They didn't do anything
they didn't want to.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.644
Tell me where my daughter is.

40:35.678 --> 40:37.564
Call an ambulance.

40:37.598 --> 40:38.812
Tell me where she is.

40:43.135 --> 40:48.638
Tell me. Where. She is.
