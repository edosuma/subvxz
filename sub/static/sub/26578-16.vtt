WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.445
Whoo-hoo!

00:01.468 --> 00:02.795
<i>My parents rarely went away,</i>

00:02.820 --> 00:05.394
<i>but when they did,
we took full advantage.</i>

00:05.419 --> 00:08.145
Whoa!

00:09.203 --> 00:11.103
Coming through!

00:11.222 --> 00:13.255
<i>I overindulged in TV viewing...</i>

00:13.358 --> 00:14.991
<i>game shows, Westerns, sitcoms...</i>

00:15.093 --> 00:17.927
<i>putting all my imaginary TV
friends through their paces.</i>

00:18.029 --> 00:19.929
Dance for me, monkeys.

00:20.031 --> 00:21.364
You should take a break.

00:21.466 --> 00:22.431
You've been glued to that box

00:22.533 --> 00:23.865
since Mom and Dad left on Friday.

00:23.901 --> 00:26.858
You're a regular Joseph Benti
from Channel Seven News.

00:26.953 --> 00:29.397
Now here's Dr. George Fischbeck
with the weather.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.100
Can I watch my show now?

00:31.166 --> 00:32.465
Go to hell.

00:33.931 --> 00:35.197
Hm.

00:35.299 --> 00:37.918
I'm guessing I'm the only one
who chose to attend Sunday mass?

00:37.981 --> 00:41.482
I got up and went to the 6:30...
had my pick of the pews.

00:41.507 --> 00:42.558
And what are you guys gonna say

00:42.586 --> 00:43.952
when Mom and Dad ask if you went?

00:44.054 --> 00:45.286
Can I see that for a second?

00:45.355 --> 00:47.655
"Look, Mom, I brought
home a church bulletin."

00:47.757 --> 00:50.525
What in the Sam Hill?!

00:50.627 --> 00:51.693
What's up?

00:51.795 --> 00:54.262
What's up is Mom and Dad
will be home any minute,

00:54.364 --> 00:57.365
and this kitchen is a sty
in which pigs would live!

00:57.467 --> 00:58.700
A pig sty?

00:58.802 --> 01:01.069
Saying the words I just said
in a different order

01:01.171 --> 01:03.171
doesn't make this place
any less like a dump

01:03.273 --> 01:04.572
in which garbage is kept.

01:04.674 --> 01:05.974
You're right. If Mom and Dad see this,

01:06.042 --> 01:08.743
they won't hug us and tell us
they love us anymore.

01:12.983 --> 01:14.749
Don't you dare add to this mess.

01:14.851 --> 01:16.317
There's a cockroach on that dish.

01:16.419 --> 01:17.518
Aah!

01:19.789 --> 01:21.122
What'd you do that for?!

01:21.224 --> 01:22.357
I was helping!

01:22.459 --> 01:23.725
We're smashing stuff?

01:23.827 --> 01:25.026
Cool.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.427
Stop it!

01:26.529 --> 01:28.029
The bug's out here now!

01:30.200 --> 01:32.333
- There he is!
- Stomp him!

01:33.403 --> 01:35.103
Bug, one... you guys, zero.

01:35.205 --> 01:36.504
I don't see him anymore.

01:36.606 --> 01:39.374
Uh, he's on your head.

01:39.476 --> 01:40.842
Hold still!

01:42.178 --> 01:44.612
Got him.

01:44.681 --> 01:45.690
Yeah.

01:45.715 --> 01:47.215
Whoo, that little guy runs fast.

01:47.317 --> 01:49.250
I like him. I like him a lot!

01:49.352 --> 01:51.986
Because he's so fast,
I'm gonna name him Mitch.

01:52.088 --> 01:53.488
That makes no sense.

01:53.590 --> 01:54.589
None at all!

01:54.691 --> 01:56.224
Now, the only question is,

01:56.292 --> 01:57.392
what's the funnest way to kill him?

01:57.494 --> 01:59.494
Cockroaches are remarkable creatures.

01:59.596 --> 02:00.962
Did you know they can live for a week

02:01.064 --> 02:02.130
with their head chopped off?

02:02.232 --> 02:03.398
I have my answer.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.233
Please don't decapitate Mitch!

02:05.335 --> 02:06.567
What choice do I have?

02:06.670 --> 02:08.870
Lawrence was talking about
a bar near Santa Anita

02:08.972 --> 02:10.538
where they hold cockroach races.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.740
Fastest roach wins a $50 prize.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.605
What's a filthy cockroach
gonna do with $50?

02:17.347 --> 02:18.746
It's your lucky day, bug.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.949
You get to live just long enough
to earn me some righteous coin.

02:22.052 --> 02:23.484
Mom and Dad just pulled up!

02:23.586 --> 02:26.087
I should probably go change
the baby's diaper.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.822
Did you miss me, Mama?

02:27.847 --> 02:28.923
What do you think?

02:29.025 --> 02:31.459
I missed you, too!

02:33.229 --> 02:36.230
Against all odds,
the house is still standing.

02:36.299 --> 02:38.868
The fact that we're happy to
come home to this seems sad.

02:38.915 --> 02:40.361
Look at this pig sty.

02:40.386 --> 02:42.204
It's like a garbage dump.

02:43.106 --> 02:44.305
How long you been watching that?

02:44.399 --> 02:45.406
I just turned it on.

02:45.508 --> 02:48.009
The bowl of wax fruit is melting.

02:48.078 --> 02:49.577
You're done.

02:55.518 --> 02:57.685
The baby seems okay,
but they all look the same.

02:57.787 --> 02:59.353
Kids could've switched him out,
and we'd never know.

02:59.456 --> 03:01.656
<i>They were returning from
a church-sanctioned weekend</i>

03:01.758 --> 03:03.324
<i>to strengthen Catholic marriages</i>

03:03.426 --> 03:05.193
<i>run by a bunch of men
who'd never been married.</i>

03:05.295 --> 03:06.627
Hey, how'd Marriage Encounter go?

03:06.663 --> 03:08.029
Did you guys deepen your relationship

03:08.098 --> 03:09.297
with each other and God?

03:09.332 --> 03:11.733
Well, hard to say,
but there was a waffle bar.

03:11.768 --> 03:12.967
Five different kinds of syrup.

03:13.036 --> 03:14.135
Your dad embarrassed himself.

03:14.204 --> 03:15.503
I went a little crazy.

03:15.605 --> 03:17.138
The best part, the food, the room,

03:17.240 --> 03:18.773
all beautifully free

03:18.842 --> 03:20.608
thanks to the Shipleys
pulling out at the last minute

03:20.677 --> 03:21.709
'cause their dumb kid broke his leg.

03:21.778 --> 03:22.877
The skateboard they got
him for Christmas

03:22.979 --> 03:24.312
ended up being a gift for us.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.748
So I'm guessing you skipped
the empathy exercises.

03:26.816 --> 03:27.915
Oh, no. We went to that one.

03:28.017 --> 03:29.584
Got a, uh, free pen.

03:29.652 --> 03:30.918
Ah, you can sign that kid's cast.

03:30.987 --> 03:32.653
"Thanks for the weekend
in Malibu, you klutz!"

03:33.730 --> 03:35.390
You know, your marriage
might have benefited

03:35.391 --> 03:36.991
from some honest examination.

03:37.060 --> 03:39.127
Don't be an idiot.
Our marriage is a rock...

03:39.159 --> 03:40.228
a rock you don't want to look under.

03:40.296 --> 03:42.163
Same reason we don't go to the dentist.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.265
You know who took all
the exercises seriously?

03:44.367 --> 03:46.801
- Wendi's parents.
- Whoa, that was a firework show.

03:46.836 --> 03:48.936
You do not want to ask
Janelle Falkenberry

03:49.005 --> 03:50.538
what makes her feel "not heard."

03:50.607 --> 03:51.706
I'll tell you where she was heard...

03:51.775 --> 03:52.840
all the way to Catalina.

03:52.909 --> 03:54.208
Oh, and Wendi's dad

03:54.310 --> 03:56.544
boo-hooing like he
was watching "Brian's Song."

03:56.613 --> 03:58.346
And then, he drove off without her.

03:58.448 --> 03:59.947
And without his free pen.

04:00.016 --> 04:02.950
Last time we saw Wendi's mom,
she was hitch-hiking along PCH.

04:03.052 --> 04:04.018
You didn't pick her up?

04:04.120 --> 04:06.120
My policy is my policy.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.456
Oh.

04:08.558 --> 04:09.857
Hi there, Wendi.

04:11.027 --> 04:13.261
Your dad forgot his pen.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:23.653 --> 04:25.467
This bug is a thoroughbred!

04:25.526 --> 04:29.216
Look at you having feelings
for another living thing.

04:29.279 --> 04:30.511
There's no feelings.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.780
I look at this bug, I see dollar signs.

04:32.849 --> 04:34.282
I want to race him at the bar you go to.

04:34.384 --> 04:35.450
You're 14.

04:35.518 --> 04:37.919
I've got an I.D. that says
I'm 33 with five kids.

04:37.988 --> 04:39.354
Why would that be on an I.D.?

04:39.422 --> 04:40.955
Now you sound like the bouncer
at Chug-a-Lug's.

04:41.024 --> 04:42.991
I mean, you're not 21.
How do you get into McSorley's?

04:43.093 --> 04:45.226
Well, the first time I went,
I was a seminarian.

04:45.295 --> 04:46.928
And it's one of those
old-school Irish places

04:46.997 --> 04:48.096
where everyone's got a fun nickname,

04:48.164 --> 04:50.098
like "Sully" or "Violent Alcoholic."

04:50.166 --> 04:52.900
So you show up in a collar,
they roll out the red carpet.

04:52.969 --> 04:54.268
Although McSorley's is more

04:54.337 --> 04:56.471
of a vomit-soaked piece of cardboard.

04:56.539 --> 04:58.439
But you still put on
your God threads and go.

04:58.541 --> 04:59.874
Yeah, every once in a while.

04:59.943 --> 05:00.908
I like it!

05:01.011 --> 05:02.677
Father Larry's got
a taste for the hooch.

05:02.779 --> 05:04.045
No, it's not like that.

05:04.114 --> 05:07.015
It's, uh... there's a waitress
that works there, Fiona.

05:07.117 --> 05:09.417
Ah, that's what you've got a taste for.

05:09.519 --> 05:12.220
- Look who's suddenly interesting.
- Yeah.

05:12.288 --> 05:14.122
I can't help you get into McSorley's.

05:14.224 --> 05:16.324
But maybe think about
joining the seminary, Joe.

05:16.393 --> 05:17.625
How would I explain that

05:17.649 --> 05:18.942
to my five kids?!

05:22.098 --> 05:25.133
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.840
"I forgive you, my son."

05:27.837 --> 05:30.038
<i>My TV binge of the previous
weekend was just a warm-up</i>

05:30.106 --> 05:33.174
<i>for the big event... the annual
Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon,</i>

05:33.209 --> 05:35.710
<i>or "The Thon," as cool people
like me called it.</i>

05:35.812 --> 05:37.145
You know, I don't care for the French,

05:37.247 --> 05:39.647
but they're right about this guy.

05:39.716 --> 05:42.016
<i>20 hours featuring the best
of Vegas, Broadway,</i>

05:42.085 --> 05:43.351
<i>and some animal acts</i>

05:43.420 --> 05:45.219
<i>which I now feel complicit for enjoying.</i>

05:45.255 --> 05:47.622
<i>Who knew orangutans don't ride
tricycles voluntarily?</i>

05:47.691 --> 05:50.158
<i>It was a big, gaudy schmaltz-fest,</i>

05:50.226 --> 05:52.544
<i>and I suckled it like a calf on a teat.</i>

05:52.653 --> 05:54.095
Dad, can I take the car?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.364
Don't hit anybody.
My insurance is high enough.

05:56.433 --> 05:59.467
And, listen, if Wendi calls,
you don't know where I went.

05:59.536 --> 06:00.735
I don't know where you went.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.170
My leather-crafting class.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.238
Oh, make me a pair of wingtips.

06:04.307 --> 06:05.339
Where's that one off to?

06:05.442 --> 06:06.541
He's got leather class.

06:06.643 --> 06:07.675
Since when?

06:07.777 --> 06:09.177
He should be over there
comforting Wendi.

06:09.279 --> 06:11.112
Poor girl's parents just split up.

06:11.181 --> 06:12.914
Her dad moved to Phoenix
or Portland or...

06:13.016 --> 06:15.016
Mr. Falkenberry moved to Provo, Utah.

06:15.118 --> 06:16.384
I knew it was a "P" town.

06:16.453 --> 06:17.985
You know what?
I should be headed to P town.

06:18.054 --> 06:19.854
I drank like a gallon of root beer.

06:19.923 --> 06:22.457
Oh, if Wendi calls,
we don't know where Eddie went.

06:22.525 --> 06:24.726
- He's lying to her?
- No, honey, we are.

06:24.794 --> 06:25.827
But only if she calls.

06:25.895 --> 06:26.961
I will not be an accomplice

06:27.063 --> 06:28.963
to whatever Italian-style philandering

06:29.065 --> 06:30.498
Eddie's trying to inflict on that girl.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.600
What philandering?
He's making some shoes.

06:32.669 --> 06:35.169
Oh, Mike, sometimes I wonder
if you live in the real world.

06:35.238 --> 06:37.572
- I should call Wendi right now.
- No, don't do that.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.574
Whatever Eddie's doing,
he has his reasons.

06:39.676 --> 06:41.976
I trust him more than I trust Wendi.

06:42.078 --> 06:43.811
A little too self-assured, that one...

06:43.913 --> 06:46.080
all pretty and bright.

06:46.182 --> 06:47.448
The very fact that she's with Eddie

06:47.550 --> 06:48.783
makes me wonder what she's up to.

06:48.818 --> 06:50.718
Well, I suspect there's some
self-esteem issues there.

06:50.820 --> 06:52.386
- She is coming from a broken home.
- Mm.

06:52.489 --> 06:54.155
Plus, living alone in that house
with Janelle

06:54.224 --> 06:55.490
can't be a bowl of cherries.

06:55.592 --> 06:57.525
Mrs. Falkenberry
isn't living with Wendi.

06:57.594 --> 06:59.827
She just started graduate school
at UC Riverside

06:59.896 --> 07:00.995
to study ornithology.

07:01.097 --> 07:02.096
Where do you get all this stuff?

07:02.198 --> 07:03.164
I'm their paperboy.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.665
We ask a lot of intrusive questions

07:04.734 --> 07:06.434
when people try to cancel
their subscriptions.

07:06.503 --> 07:07.735
Okay, scram. It's bedtime.

07:07.804 --> 07:09.137
B-But it's "The Thon"!

07:09.205 --> 07:10.938
Come on, Mom, it's for Jerry's Kids.

07:11.007 --> 07:12.306
I barely care about my kids.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.975
Beat it!

07:14.069 --> 07:15.240
Hey.

07:15.311 --> 07:16.577
You see what's going on here?

07:16.646 --> 07:19.280
No mom, no dad... Wendi's living
there unsupervised.

07:19.349 --> 07:22.049
And you wanted to send Eddie
over there to comfort her.

07:22.118 --> 07:23.885
It's a good thing
he's at that leather class.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.597
There is no leather class, you rube!

07:25.656 --> 07:27.889
Let's not use language
we're gonna regret, Peg.

07:32.061 --> 07:33.895
Why are you dressed
like a train conductor?

07:33.963 --> 07:37.398
I've been having a really fun
adventure today, all by myself.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.699
I'm going back out there.

07:38.768 --> 07:40.968
Uh, Mom made it pretty clear
she wanted us gone.

07:41.070 --> 07:42.103
You don't get it, William.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.971
With the telethon,
anything can happen...

07:44.040 --> 07:46.440
a historic reunion
between Jerry and Dean,

07:46.543 --> 07:48.509
Mitzi Gaynor performing
with the cast of "Pippin."

07:48.578 --> 07:49.944
I mean, if I miss that,
what will I talk about

07:50.013 --> 07:51.279
with the kids at school?

07:51.347 --> 07:53.414
Mom and Dad are in there
discussing grown-up stuff.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.715
Who cares what they're discussing,

07:54.751 --> 07:56.083
as long as they keep it down
so I can hear

07:56.152 --> 07:58.252
the comedy stylings of
Willie Tyler and Lester.

07:59.489 --> 08:01.322
- Want to play checkers?
- Wish I could,

08:01.391 --> 08:03.573
but the 7:20 to Bakersfield is late.

08:03.598 --> 08:04.673
Don't you see?

08:04.674 --> 08:06.737
Eddie's not lying to Wendi...
he's lying to us!

08:06.784 --> 08:07.940
Those two are probably doing laps

08:07.964 --> 08:09.697
in the Falkenberrys'
waterbed as we speak.

08:09.766 --> 08:11.933
- We need to get over there.
- No, no, no.

08:11.968 --> 08:13.501
If you're wrong,
you're just gonna bust open

08:13.570 --> 08:15.503
whatever secret Eddie
is hiding from Wendi.

08:15.605 --> 08:16.704
And if you're right,

08:16.773 --> 08:18.706
we're walking in on
two redheads on a waterbed.

08:18.808 --> 08:20.208
You want to see that? I don't.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.676
Well, somebody's got to drive me.

08:21.778 --> 08:22.877
At your service, Mom.

08:22.946 --> 08:25.479
Frank, you're unbearable.

08:25.582 --> 08:27.381
Let's go.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.621
<i>Is your sister still, uh,
fooling around like...</i>

08:35.825 --> 08:37.768
<i>She had me over. Wait a second.</i>

08:37.861 --> 08:40.160
And after he passed,
I missed him so much.

08:40.230 --> 08:42.763
And then, one day, this little
bird appeared in my yard.

08:42.832 --> 08:45.366
He just sat there and watched me
while I was working.

08:45.468 --> 08:47.034
And I would swear to Christ

08:47.103 --> 08:49.437
that sparrow was the spirit
of my dead dad.

08:49.539 --> 08:52.506
Is that even remotely possible, Father?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.775
I'd have to see the bird
to know for sure,

08:54.844 --> 08:57.211
but I-I'd be shocked
if it wasn't your dad.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.779
That's what I told my wife.

08:58.882 --> 09:01.649
She said reincarnation
was more of a Hindu thing.

09:01.718 --> 09:03.484
The Church is adding
new stuff all the time.

09:03.519 --> 09:05.920
I mean, the Pope hasn't gone
wide with that one yet,

09:05.989 --> 09:07.221
- but you'll be hearing about it.
- Oh.

09:07.323 --> 09:08.823
I have a question for you, Father.

09:08.925 --> 09:11.692
Why do you look so young for a priest?

09:11.794 --> 09:12.793
Will you excuse us?

09:12.896 --> 09:14.629
- Sure.
- Thanks.

09:14.697 --> 09:15.997
I knew I'd find you here.

09:16.099 --> 09:18.566
You should not have told
that guy his father was a bird.

09:18.635 --> 09:20.668
Isn't it our job to give people
comfort through nonsense?

09:20.737 --> 09:22.303
It's not either of our jobs.

09:22.405 --> 09:24.238
These are on the house, padres.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.007
You just being here
makes the rest of these animals

09:26.109 --> 09:28.242
less handsy.

09:28.344 --> 09:30.111
Always nice seeing you, Father Lawrence.

09:30.179 --> 09:32.847
Yeah, it's, uh... it's really
nice to see you, too, Fiona.

09:32.949 --> 09:35.883
I am taking you out of here
before you embarrass both of us.

09:35.985 --> 09:38.119
I've got these yokels totally snowed.

09:38.221 --> 09:39.854
I'm marrying that couple on Saturday.

09:39.956 --> 09:41.756
Then I'll just have to tell
everyone you're not a priest.

09:41.858 --> 09:44.425
I could do the same to you,
starting with Fiona.

09:44.527 --> 09:46.493
Mellow out. We've got a race to win.

09:47.597 --> 09:49.597
Look at the fire in his eyes.

09:49.699 --> 09:51.732
I believe his eyes are on the other end.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.067
Well then, he's got fire in his butt.

09:53.143 --> 09:54.902
Either way, he's gonna go fast.

09:56.439 --> 09:58.280
Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

09:59.472 --> 10:01.726
No, I only needed you to drive.
You can wait in the car.

10:01.796 --> 10:03.626
I-I feel I would be
more helpful backing you up

10:03.697 --> 10:06.337
on the scene,
i-in case things go sideways.

10:06.423 --> 10:08.141
You know how you can really be helpful?

10:08.210 --> 10:09.809
And I'm not just making up
busy work to get rid of you

10:09.878 --> 10:11.712
- 'cause you annoy me.
- Understood.

10:11.798 --> 10:13.408
You go around the house
and cover the back door.

10:13.463 --> 10:14.930
In case they make a run for it.

10:14.998 --> 10:17.065
Smart!

10:19.503 --> 10:21.793
Mrs. Cleary. I wasn't expecting you.

10:21.868 --> 10:23.134
No, you weren't.

10:23.214 --> 10:24.673
I wanted to give your mother
a casserole,

10:24.741 --> 10:27.436
so I brought it here because
here is where she lives.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.022
Wow.

10:29.947 --> 10:32.314
A can of mushroom soup and green beans?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.715
Want me to chew it for her, too?

10:33.784 --> 10:35.617
I am in position!

10:35.652 --> 10:37.642
- What's that?
- A reminder that I really need

10:37.666 --> 10:39.321
a driver's license.

10:40.490 --> 10:42.157
Huh. I heard something.

10:42.252 --> 10:44.225
Eddie wouldn't be here,
by any chance, hm?

10:44.250 --> 10:47.496
Oh, no. But my mother
is taking a nap upstairs.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.097
Uh, sometimes she talks in her sleep.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.432
Oh. Does she say, "I'm Eddie.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.733
I hope my mom doesn't find me"?

10:51.802 --> 10:53.568
Mrs. Cleary, I told you
Eddie's not here.

10:53.637 --> 10:56.605
Well, sometimes I think
he's not home, and then... boom!

10:56.673 --> 10:58.506
Unfortunately, there he is.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.208
- Uh... Hm.
- So, just to be sure...

11:00.310 --> 11:02.043
Eddie!

11:02.079 --> 11:04.012
I brought your favorite baseball card!

11:04.114 --> 11:06.715
Dick Allen with the ridiculous
sideburns.

11:06.783 --> 11:09.684
I can't believe an adult man
goes outside like that.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.586
On the count of three,
I'm tearing it to pieces.

11:11.655 --> 11:13.822
- He's really not here.
- Hm.

11:13.890 --> 11:18.493
One... two... three!

11:20.464 --> 11:21.730
I was wrong.

11:21.798 --> 11:22.897
He's really not here.

11:23.000 --> 11:23.932
Huh.

11:24.001 --> 11:25.433
Which doesn't make a lick of sense,

11:25.469 --> 11:27.569
'cause I know for a fact
you're living alone now.

11:27.638 --> 11:29.504
What?

11:29.606 --> 11:30.839
It's true.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.008
My mom decided to let me
stay here alone,

11:33.110 --> 11:34.709
just until we sell the house.

11:34.811 --> 11:37.379
Then I have to move in
with the nuns at school.

11:37.414 --> 11:39.414
The convent? Oh.

11:39.516 --> 11:41.082
Well, that would be
a terrible place for Eddie

11:41.151 --> 11:43.785
to try to hide in the closet!

11:43.854 --> 11:45.253
Yes, I misled you.

11:45.322 --> 11:46.688
But I told you the truth about Eddie.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.823
Wendi, sometimes I lie to get my way,

11:48.892 --> 11:50.825
and that's all right
because it's me doing it.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.794
But if someone tries to pull
the wool over my eyes...

11:52.896 --> 11:54.195
The wool wasn't for your eyes.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.463
It was for Eddie's.

11:55.532 --> 11:57.065
He's the one I'm keeping
this a secret from.

11:57.167 --> 11:58.800
You're lying to my Eddie?

11:58.869 --> 12:01.536
And you're not just saying that
to make me like you more?

12:01.571 --> 12:04.472
Whenever he's over, I just say
my mom's napping upstairs.

12:04.541 --> 12:05.840
If he knew I was here alone,

12:05.909 --> 12:08.643
he might assume that
he can just come here any time

12:08.745 --> 12:10.111
and we'll do stuff.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.480
And I would like to keep control
of that situation.

12:12.549 --> 12:14.949
Honey, you have to.

12:15.052 --> 12:16.618
Men do not have an off switch.

12:16.687 --> 12:18.253
Without women pumpin' the brakes,

12:18.355 --> 12:19.587
they would have never built the pyramids

12:19.656 --> 12:21.756
or that new Montgomery Ward
at the Eagle Rock Mall.

12:21.858 --> 12:23.391
So you understand?

12:23.460 --> 12:25.560
Of course.

12:25.595 --> 12:27.429
Well, I'm gonna walk home now.

12:27.531 --> 12:28.830
In a couple hours,

12:28.865 --> 12:30.632
open the back door
and tell Frank I'm gone.

12:30.701 --> 12:32.033
He'll be in the bushes.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.138
A nice night for racing.

12:37.207 --> 12:38.673
I got a pipe in the ceiling
that's leaking,

12:38.775 --> 12:41.009
so, hopefully, he likes a wet track.

12:41.034 --> 12:42.120
Can I get you another drink?

12:42.145 --> 12:44.256
- I'll have...
- Just a water, please.

12:44.281 --> 12:45.513
What's the matter, Father?

12:45.582 --> 12:48.116
You hit the Blood of Christ
a little hard last night?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.335
I don't understand why you aren't

12:49.360 --> 12:50.422
closing that deal.

12:50.447 --> 12:53.421
- She is a stone fox.
- Well, Fiona thinks I'm a priest.

12:53.490 --> 12:54.956
If I ask her out, I'm a sleazeball.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.225
And if I tell her I lied,
I'm also a sleazeball.

12:57.294 --> 12:59.861
What about this... you say
you're thinking about ditching

12:59.963 --> 13:02.363
the whole priest racket
to get it on with her hot bod?

13:02.466 --> 13:04.999
But feel free to snooze it up
with the Lawrence-speak.

13:05.068 --> 13:06.634
Fixing old lies with new lies?

13:06.737 --> 13:07.969
That'd be even sleazier.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.504
I mean, look at Mitch here.

13:09.573 --> 13:12.207
People are repulsed by him,
but that's their problem.

13:12.275 --> 13:14.142
He eats what he wants,
goes where he wants,

13:14.211 --> 13:16.811
and he's probably got a family
under every refrigerator in L.A.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.481
Father, is that cockroach story
one of the Parables?

13:19.549 --> 13:22.450
No, I'm trying to get you
to grow a parables.

13:25.622 --> 13:26.888
- Get me my money!
- Are you ready?

13:26.957 --> 13:29.224
All roaches and trainers
to the starting gate!

13:29.326 --> 13:31.526
- I got to get my bets in.
- Final call for bets!

13:31.628 --> 13:33.828
And of course, Wendi's
got Eddie completely fooled

13:33.930 --> 13:35.363
'cause she's so much smarter than he is.

13:35.432 --> 13:37.232
Oh, that's gonna be true
no matter who he dates.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.633
Well, unless it's the Mullen girl,

13:38.702 --> 13:41.202
the one who ran into that tree
limb and now likes to hug a lot.

13:41.271 --> 13:44.038
And you think it's a-okay,
Wendi manipulating Eddie?

13:44.107 --> 13:46.374
If it keeps our lummox son
from having easy access to her.

13:46.443 --> 13:48.176
I don't want any grandchildren
till I'm old enough

13:48.245 --> 13:49.477
so that I don't have to play with them.

13:49.546 --> 13:50.612
She's lying to him, Peg.

13:50.714 --> 13:51.780
But you didn't seem to mind

13:51.882 --> 13:53.248
when you thought he was lying to her.

13:53.350 --> 13:55.383
That was a one-time lie,

13:55.485 --> 13:57.519
the kind men have to do all the time.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.987
"Yes, honey, your hair looks nice,"

13:59.055 --> 14:00.288
when it really looks like something

14:00.357 --> 14:01.523
constructed by beavers.

14:01.625 --> 14:02.924
But Wendi's lie?

14:02.959 --> 14:05.093
That's a whole other megillah.

14:05.195 --> 14:08.563
It's sneaky and complicated and female.

14:08.632 --> 14:11.232
And totally justified,
if you want the pyramids.

14:11.301 --> 14:12.700
I'm just saying...

14:12.769 --> 14:14.803
she shouldn't be afraid
to communicate with Eddie.

14:14.905 --> 14:16.538
"Communicate"?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.373
You were listening at
the Marriage Encounter.

14:18.475 --> 14:20.542
You weren't just there for
the waffles or the free pens!

14:20.610 --> 14:22.510
- I knew it!
- You know, I look at Wendi

14:22.612 --> 14:23.912
leading our son around by the nose,

14:24.014 --> 14:25.713
and it puts me in the mind of you, Peg,

14:25.816 --> 14:26.915
when we were courting.

14:26.983 --> 14:28.283
Yeah, yeah. I was very pretty.

14:28.385 --> 14:30.952
You two have the same female wiles.

14:31.021 --> 14:33.888
And me, just a raw kid thinking
he had a steady girlfriend,

14:33.990 --> 14:36.224
when you had another guy
dangling on a string.

14:36.326 --> 14:37.492
What other guy?

14:37.561 --> 14:39.227
You mean Dave Borkowski?

14:39.329 --> 14:41.296
I'm talking about Ray Mulvihill.

14:41.398 --> 14:43.097
Who's Dave Borkowski?

14:43.133 --> 14:44.388
Just a name I read in a book somewhere.

14:44.412 --> 14:45.768
Yeah, well, stay on topic.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.335
I remember when I finally put
all the pieces together.

14:47.437 --> 14:48.803
It made me feel foolish.

14:48.905 --> 14:49.971
And feeling foolish

14:50.073 --> 14:51.906
is not the best foundation
for a relationship.

14:52.008 --> 14:53.341
More Marriage Encounter hokum.

14:53.443 --> 14:55.510
No, it's not hokum
to want to trust the person

14:55.612 --> 14:57.011
you're attempting to
spend your life with.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.314
And you don't trust me because
I had a few boyfriends?

14:59.349 --> 15:01.716
You said it yourself...
I was prettier than Wendi.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.953
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cleary.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.521
I picked her up after leather class.

15:06.590 --> 15:08.056
We wanted to show you the purse I made.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.991
The big "W" is for "Wendi."

15:10.060 --> 15:12.293
Oh, you see?
Eddie wasn't hiding anything

15:12.362 --> 15:14.529
except a nice surprise
for his girlfriend.

15:14.598 --> 15:15.597
Hey, Wendi.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.731
Is there a little pocket in there

15:16.833 --> 15:17.966
for you to keep your secrets?

15:18.068 --> 15:19.901
I also made her mom a cute coin purse.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.936
You need to give her that in person.

15:21.972 --> 15:24.038
Your mom never seems to be awake
when I'm around the house.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.274
She'll love it,
just like I love my purse.

15:26.309 --> 15:27.475
Do you really love it, Wendi?

15:27.544 --> 15:28.910
She just said she did, Mike.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.578
Or are you taking Eddie
for a buggy ride?

15:30.647 --> 15:33.214
- Mike, stop.
- Are we going on a buggy ride?

15:33.283 --> 15:34.849
Uh, I don't know what you mean,
Mr. Cleary.

15:34.885 --> 15:36.885
Well, when someone
isn't honest about one thing,

15:36.987 --> 15:38.620
maybe they're not being honest
about lots of stuff.

15:38.722 --> 15:39.888
Okay, after we met,

15:39.956 --> 15:41.623
I went roller-skating
with Dave Borkowski.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.625
- You happy?
- Why don't you tell Eddie the truth...

15:43.727 --> 15:44.959
that you're not living with your mother?

15:45.028 --> 15:46.794
I asked him not to spill
those beans, but here we go...

15:46.863 --> 15:48.029
beans everywhere.

15:48.098 --> 15:50.064
Your mom isn't there?
Why didn't you tell me?

15:51.101 --> 15:53.902
My parents divorcing has been
a lot of change to deal with.

15:54.004 --> 15:57.071
I just... didn't want everything
changing with us, too...

15:57.140 --> 16:00.441
you seeing me living alone
as a chance to speed things up.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.944
- You didn't trust me.
- I guess.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.781
Or maybe I didn't trust
myself to be responsible.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.517
Well, in a way, I guess
this is kind of a relief.

16:09.619 --> 16:10.785
With your mom always napping,

16:10.887 --> 16:12.854
I was starting to get worried about her.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.258
Get your final bets in.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.127
The betting windows are closing.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.728
I'm more excited than I thought I'd be.

16:20.797 --> 16:21.963
It's not so much the race...

16:22.065 --> 16:23.932
it's the pageantry that gets to me.

16:24.034 --> 16:25.900
And they're in the gate.

16:25.969 --> 16:27.168
Hold on!

16:27.270 --> 16:29.337
One of our little fellas
is getting ahead of himself.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.438
- Get him back in the corral. Oh.
- Aww.

16:30.540 --> 16:31.673
False start.

16:31.775 --> 16:33.241
Your little guy is trying to cheat.

16:33.343 --> 16:34.442
Now he's walking kind of funny.

16:34.544 --> 16:36.444
He hurt himself trying
to take a head start.

16:36.546 --> 16:38.479
Out of my way! Let me see.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.781
You okay, Mitch?

16:39.883 --> 16:41.215
You'll be all right, little guy.

16:41.284 --> 16:43.184
We've got a late scratch
in the first race.

16:45.055 --> 16:47.288
And they're off! "Paparoach" broke well.

16:47.390 --> 16:49.524
It's "Rojo Tuna" and "Roach-el Welch"!

16:49.626 --> 16:51.826
Who's it gonna be, folks?
You never know!

16:51.928 --> 16:53.861
Here they come up the straight length.

16:53.964 --> 16:57.149
"Roach-el Welch" with the victory!

17:01.126 --> 17:03.684
Eddie, can you understand

17:03.767 --> 17:06.935
why Wendi was hesitant
to tell the truth?

17:09.056 --> 17:10.821
Now's your chance to be heard.

17:10.891 --> 17:12.165
Well...

17:12.189 --> 17:14.134
That's not how they did it
at the Marriage Encounter.

17:14.181 --> 17:15.914
How do you know?
You weren't even listening.

17:15.939 --> 17:18.016
I was half-listening
so I could make fun of it.

17:18.094 --> 17:19.453
Eddie, just because
Wendi's living alone,

17:19.482 --> 17:21.315
it's not an open invitation
for you to show up

17:21.367 --> 17:22.500
and slobber all over her.

17:22.579 --> 17:23.944
Wendi, lying to a man you care about

17:24.013 --> 17:28.324
is not the best way to start off
a, ugh, relationship.

17:28.363 --> 17:30.090
Thank you.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.153
I think Eddie and I have both decided

17:32.222 --> 17:34.279
we can spend time alone at my house

17:34.324 --> 17:37.025
while still being responsible
and taking things slow.

17:37.094 --> 17:40.195
Very good open, honest
communicating, Wendi.

17:42.032 --> 17:45.200
I can't believe I used those words.

17:45.268 --> 17:48.036
- That weekend wasn't free.
- No, it was not.

17:48.105 --> 17:50.805
<i>Meanwhile, back on "The Thon,"
history was being made...</i>

17:50.874 --> 17:52.974
<i>a once-in-a-generation convergence</i>

17:53.076 --> 17:54.609

17:56.558 --> 17:58.913

18:39.823 --> 18:42.023
Well, they totally bought it.

18:42.092 --> 18:44.411
I'd like to think the purse
really put us over the top.

18:44.481 --> 18:47.195
- It is so awful. Where did you get it?
- At the Woolworth's.

18:47.264 --> 18:48.963
Then I used a lighter
to burn in the "W."

18:49.032 --> 18:51.065
So now your mom and dad
totally trust us,

18:51.134 --> 18:53.170
and we can be alone
and do whatever we want.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.744
Well, you know what
I can't stop thinking about?

18:55.839 --> 18:58.006
- It's a buggy ride, isn't it?
- Yep.

18:59.443 --> 19:00.575
Sorry, buddy.

19:00.677 --> 19:02.076
I pushed you too hard.

19:02.179 --> 19:03.278
If you're interested, Father,

19:03.380 --> 19:05.213
we usually take
the losing roaches out back

19:05.315 --> 19:07.549
and bet on which one
the crow eats first.

19:07.584 --> 19:10.418
Considering the bum leg,
Mitch would be the favorite.

19:10.487 --> 19:13.822
He might not be able to race,
but he still has value.

19:13.890 --> 19:15.623
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

19:18.161 --> 19:19.658
Fiona.

19:19.729 --> 19:20.963
Yeah, Father?

19:21.031 --> 19:23.231
I have a confession to make.

19:24.868 --> 19:30.972
I really like you and I'm not a priest.

19:31.041 --> 19:33.274
Reaction?

19:33.376 --> 19:36.110
- I don't know what to say.
- You're right.

19:36.213 --> 19:39.514
- I'm a disgusting sleazeball.
- Calm down.

19:39.549 --> 19:41.883
In this place, you wouldn't
even crack the top 10.

19:43.453 --> 19:45.620
I've always thought
you were a sweetheart.

19:45.722 --> 19:48.223
And I wouldn't mind doing
something about it.

19:48.325 --> 19:49.424
But why'd you think

19:49.526 --> 19:50.725
you had to wear the collar?

19:50.827 --> 19:52.861
'Cause, otherwise, they'd card me.

19:52.963 --> 19:54.462
Because you're...?

19:54.564 --> 19:56.231
20.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.233
You're 20?

19:58.335 --> 20:00.568
I'm 43.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.136
Reaction?

20:03.406 --> 20:05.673
Doesn't change a thing.

20:05.775 --> 20:07.709
Murph, I'm going home!

20:07.811 --> 20:10.044

20:14.017 --> 20:16.784

20:16.887 --> 20:19.988

20:20.090 --> 20:23.258
We can feel good
about trusting those two.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.692
I don't see the point

20:24.794 --> 20:27.829
of all these webs
you ladies like to weave.

20:27.931 --> 20:29.928
<i>Eddie and Wendi
made two critical mistakes...</i>

20:30.009 --> 20:32.303
<i>Eddie left the Woolworth's
receipt inside the coin purse,</i>

20:32.374 --> 20:34.443
<i>and Wendi asked him out
in the first place.</i>

20:34.477 --> 20:37.880
I skillfully cut through all the lies.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.444
Now everything's above board.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.920
Yep.

20:40.975 --> 20:43.719
You cracked the case, Mike.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.733
Do you have a phone number
for that fella at your work

20:45.758 --> 20:47.423
looking to buy a house
in our neighborhood?

20:47.455 --> 20:49.058
- Why do you ask?
- Hm.

20:53.388 --> 20:55.021
Hello, Sister Vincent.

20:55.096 --> 20:57.412
Is Wendi ready?
We're gonna go to the movies.
