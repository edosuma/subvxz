00:47.958 --> 00:49.958
(Phone rings)

00:56.500 --> 00:59.083
Jodie, is that you?

01:00.417 --> 01:02.417
It's her, yeah?

01:02.708 --> 01:04.708
It's hard to tell.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.500
These are becoming really frequent now, I think it's a sign.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.458
Yeah, she's been gone a long time now.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.375
Maybe she got it out of her system.

01:17.083 --> 01:21.375
Come on let's get you inside, getting cold out here, come on.

01:24.708 --> 01:31.958
In the build up to the anniversary of Jodie Bryant's tragic disappearance
of Brentwood Essex. Her parents have launched a fresh appeal for her return.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.250
Jodie Bryant was 14 years old at the time of her disappearance.

01:35.375 --> 01:41.750
She was last seen in school around lunch time, and it's thought she went
home to collect some belongings before heading to the train station.

01:41.750 --> 01:48.042
With the exception of scattering of unconfirmed reports
around Essex, it seems that Jodie has just disappeared.

01:48.167 --> 01:52.667
Police have been unable turn anything up concrete since her disappearance.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.000
Someone must know something.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.917
Someone must have seen.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.042
Or be sitting with her right now.

02:09.708 --> 02:11.333
Or she could have died.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.875
Or been killed.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.125
Someone must know something.

02:20.083 --> 02:22.958
Contact the charity or the police anonymously.

02:23.958 --> 02:25.583
You don't need to give your identification.

02:27.208 --> 02:28.833
We would just like some answers thank you.

02:29.292 --> 02:33.458
Over the past year Sally Bryant has actively searched for her daughter.

02:33.667 --> 02:41.875
To many a familiar sight on the railway networks. She's often found
in railway stations or shopping centres at times a high profile campaign.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.458
Mrs Bryant?

03:04.625 --> 03:05.333
Yeah?

03:05.542 --> 03:10.167
I'm Kevin I'm from the Essex Mercury.
I was sent by your solicitor to speak about Jodie?

03:10.708 --> 03:13.250
Right, so Clive sent you, okay come in.

03:18.292 --> 03:21.875
So, can you tell me about the day it happened?

03:25.333 --> 03:29.833
In the morning everything seemed fine, we had breakfast together.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.917
Jodie went to school.

03:32.708 --> 03:34.958
My husband left for work, and I left for my work.

03:36.708 --> 03:38.708
When I came home, everything still seemed fine.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.208
But she never came home.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.875
When did you realise something was wrong?

03:46.875 --> 03:50.833
I called around five, and I heard her phone ringing upstairs.

03:50.875 --> 03:51.958
She's a teenager.

03:53.083 --> 03:55.083
Teenagers takes their phones everywhere, so

03:55.833 --> 03:57.833
Immediately I knew something was wrong.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.667
Do you think she disappeared on purpose?

04:02.750 --> 04:04.750
Oh fuck I don't know.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.708
Sorry.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.125
What do you think happened?

04:14.958 --> 04:16.958
I think she thought she was an adult.

04:19.417 --> 04:21.417
And its likely caused her to run away.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.208
Very shortly afterwards she realised she was a child.

04:29.792 --> 04:35.958
Threw weeks later, we started getting phone calls from local phone boxes.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.250
Basildon, Orsett, Tilbury, Colchester.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.583
But she never withheld the number.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.167
I believe she was waiting for us to say something that

04:46.708 --> 04:48.458
Would make her come home.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.792
Do you think she's safe?

04:58.167 --> 04:59.583
I hope so.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.667
Tell me about what you have done to bring her home.

05:06.292 --> 05:08.292
We've done everything.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.250
Everything.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.583
I now go to the town and hand out flyers.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.250
And we did set up a charity.

05:22.042 --> 05:23.917
But, people forget.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.792
And we haven't had any donations for six weeks.

05:31.708 --> 05:33.708
How do you er, how do you feel?

05:35.167 --> 05:37.167
How do you think I feel?

05:38.292 --> 05:41.000
I'm empty, I'm destroyed.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.667
I just want my child back.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.708
If you could tell her one thing.

05:51.292 --> 05:53.292
What would it be?

05:56.583 --> 05:58.583
I'd tell her to come home.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.917
Just come home.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
It doesn't matter we love her.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.083
Just come home.

06:24.208 --> 06:26.208
Hello? Is that Clive?

06:27.333 --> 06:29.083
Hello Clive, its Kevin.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.500
I've made contact with Mrs Bryant

06:31.917 --> 06:34.708
Yeah, I'll try my best to help them find her.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
I'll cover the story this week.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.542
Okay thats good.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.875
Yeah I'll talk to you then.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.417
(Phone rings)

08:01.250 --> 08:04.125
Hello? Yeah this is her.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.583
Your shitting me?

08:10.333 --> 08:12.000
Where?

08:12.750 --> 08:14.167
It's definitely her?

08:15.042 --> 08:17.042
Sorry, where?

08:18.167 --> 08:20.125
Okay thank you.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.333
Girls, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.125
We had another sighting, sorry.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.375
(Phone rings)

09:06.792 --> 09:07.375
Hello?

09:07.417 --> 09:08.708
Hello Paul.

09:10.292 --> 09:11.583
Jules how's it going?

09:12.042 --> 09:16.125
Well you know, I'm not getting the money I should be, your two months behind.

09:16.875 --> 09:19.333
Yeah about that Jules I'm a bit skint at the minute mate.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.667
I'm in so much debt you know sally is still trying to find Jodie.

09:22.958 --> 09:26.583
To be honest I have no interest in your personal
arrangements what so ever.

09:26.875 --> 09:30.000
You have no issue with borrowing the money,
but it's always the same with people like you.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.208
Always reluctant to pay it back.

09:32.417 --> 09:35.542
No, its not like that mate, I just need a little bit more time.

09:35.625 --> 09:40.167
Times up, Paul. We had an agreement and you
have failed to keep to your end up of the deal.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.250
Tell Sally to expect a visit.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.167
Jules please, Jules?

09:47.250 --> 09:48.667
Jules?

09:48.875 --> 09:50.750
Julian?

09:55.417 --> 09:56.375
Fuck!

09:57.583 --> 09:58.583
Fuck.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.042
Fuck.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.625
It's payday Sally.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.750
Debts must be paid.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.208
We had an agreement.

10:47.458 --> 10:51.875
But don't worry, I'm offering really easy payment.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.708
(Phone rings)

12:35.667 --> 12:37.083
Hello?

12:51.083 --> 12:53.083
Is this your daughter?

12:53.833 --> 12:55.833
No. No it's not.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.292
Are you sure?

12:58.458 --> 12:59.250
Yeah.

13:02.125 --> 13:05.167
I'm sorry to have put you through this Mrs Bryant

13:07.292 --> 13:09.292
She doesn't even look like the picture.

13:10.875 --> 13:17.583
Her hair, her skin, her freckles, don't you fucking
people check? You cant keep doing this to me.

13:20.542 --> 13:24.250
I'm awfully sorry Mrs Bryant she was considered a match.

13:25.625 --> 13:29.250
If she was black would she still be considered a fucking match.

13:29.625 --> 13:33.000
Nothing is the same, her height, her weight?

13:34.833 --> 13:36.833
I'm sorry I need to leave.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.250
We can't go on like this Paul.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.042
Like what?

13:49.333 --> 13:51.000
We need to go out.

13:51.833 --> 13:55.333
Go to the cinema, go for a walk, I don't give a shit.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.583
I can't live in this prison anymore.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.750
We cant afford it Sal.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
But we can't afford to be like this either.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
We're just existing.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.125
I know.

14:14.875 --> 14:17.583
Do you know how long its been since we laughed.

14:19.042 --> 14:22.292
Watched a DVD or since you made love to me.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.875
I know.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.417
We have to face the facts.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.708
Look at me.

14:33.167 --> 14:35.167
She's either gone because she needed to.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.958
Or she's dead.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.750
I know.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.417
Paul we can't do this anymore.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.458
I know.

15:05.292 --> 15:07.292
She's gone.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.042
I know.

15:17.167 --> 15:21.333
We have to move on today or its going to be the end of us as well.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.750
I know.

15:30.125 --> 15:34.167
I love you, so much.

15:38.333 --> 15:39.708
I know.

15:42.833 --> 15:46.208
Your right, we have to start again.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.458
I know.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.000
Have you seen him over there?

16:39.125 --> 16:40.125
I know tell me about it.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.042
(She laughs)

16:43.375 --> 16:43.833
Do I look alright?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.250
Yeah you look good. Yeah.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.208
Seen you looking at me.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.208
Sorry?

17:12.500 --> 17:15.292
You want me don't you? You want me inside you.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.458
Do I really?

17:17.458 --> 17:19.917
Yeah. You want it.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.542
You don't know what your talking about.

17:25.625 --> 17:30.958
You know I could make you feel so good and
its been ages since you felt good isn't it?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.625
What would you know?

17:32.625 --> 17:36.583
I know what I see, and I reckon you want it.

17:36.875 --> 17:37.833
*Scoffs*

17:37.917 --> 17:39.167
Carry on kidding yourself love.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.125
Really.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.000
Yeah. Your barking up the wrong tree darling.

17:43.208 --> 17:46.167
Good try though, little less direct next time.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.708
Oh so there will be a next time?

17:47.708 --> 17:48.667
(Scoffs)

17:48.750 --> 17:49.625
No, not with me.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.792
Yeah, yeah, we'll see about that.

17:53.458 --> 17:55.083
I'm happily married.

17:55.292 --> 17:57.292
What in a sexless marriage.

17:58.542 --> 18:00.542
You think you know it all don't you.

18:00.708 --> 18:03.875
I know the face of a women who hasn't had a good fuck in years, yeah.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.958
Leave it yeah?

18:10.750 --> 18:12.750
Hey we can make this whatever you want.

18:12.917 --> 18:17.333
But you want something. No, no, no, no you need something.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.875
Even if I only give your pussy a good rub.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.417
Fuck, you serious?

18:23.375 --> 18:24.917
What will it be love?

18:25.125 --> 18:28.833
I'll have a G&T thanks and whatever this cunt wants.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.250
Same again yeah?

18:32.125 --> 18:33.750
So you buying me a drink now are you?

18:33.750 --> 18:38.833
Yeah. Because maybe with a bit of lubrication you might
find yourself with some better chat up lines.

18:39.167 --> 18:39.958
(Laughs)

18:40.333 --> 18:42.167
Lu-bric-ation.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.875
I'm up for a bit of that, how about you?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.667
I'm lubricated enough thanks.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.750
So what we waiting for?

18:55.167 --> 18:56.792
Eight fifty please love.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.667
He'll pay.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.750
(He laughs)

19:10.125 --> 19:12.125
What a dick.

19:14.292 --> 19:15.250
Men

19:31.875 --> 19:34.208
Ah bless, boyfriend chuck you out?

19:35.667 --> 19:37.667
You and I got some unfinished business.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.208
Come on no struggle.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.292
I just wanted to see what you would do.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.083
More than we currently are now.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.208
Like?

19:45.333 --> 19:46.417
I want to eat you.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.583
And I want a good hard cock.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.167
Then you might just get one.

19:50.875 --> 19:54.500
I said good and hard. What your packing is neither.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.125
Hello I'm Morris.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.667
We spoke about the Jodie Bryant situation on the phone.

20:21.375 --> 20:26.750
Before we move forward. Punctuality is very important
to me, do not make me ever wait for you again.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.125
Yeah traffic was terrible...

20:29.542 --> 20:34.208
Business are made and broken by attention to detail.
This includes making appointments.

20:34.375 --> 20:35.167
Understood.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.417
Good, shall we move on?

20:37.500 --> 20:39.500
Do you have any issues regarding the work?

20:39.667 --> 20:41.667
No. Yes.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.375
Why you interested?

20:44.500 --> 20:49.708
The girl's parents owe me a sizable debt. Getting her back will
enable them to be more together and pay what they owe.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.083
Is there a limit?

20:51.083 --> 20:59.500
No limits. Alive or dead, I need to know; I need this girl home either way.
Whatever it costs is whatever it costs, I'll add the debt to the Bryants' bill.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.375
Do I get to speak to mum and dad?

21:01.542 --> 21:08.208
No, everything available, you have. You are a private detective Morris, join the dots.

21:08.208 --> 21:13.417
I have none the less pulled in a few favours and you will have a hard
drive delivered to you today with all the police records.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.167
Ah now.

21:16.042 --> 21:20.417
I know thats lovely and everything, but the thing is I
don't like to work with stolen stuff, dodgy stuff.

21:20.542 --> 21:26.000
You will work with whatever I proved you with or you wont work at all.
If you don't find this girls ill ensure you never work again.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.292
Yeah, but look.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.542
No buts Maurice, you claim to be the best in your field now prove it.

21:30.542 --> 21:38.500
If you do the job the police and media can't, you'll be the most in-demand private
investigator in the country. This could make you a very wealthy man, Maurice.

21:39.542 --> 21:42.167
Something I know certainly are not right now.

21:42.167 --> 21:45.625
My financial situation has bearing whatsoever on how good a job I do.

21:45.625 --> 21:50.042
But it helps, it helps being able to pay one's bills.

21:50.375 --> 22:00.500
I've asked around you Mr Sinclair I know your a hard man and that sort of stuff,
you don't muck about so I will be giving you benefit of the doubt.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.625
(He laughs)

22:01.625 --> 22:10.375
You are not in a position to give me benefit of the doubt. I earn a lot of money,
I give others the benefit of the doubt, nobody does this with me.

22:10.375 --> 22:14.208
This will be the making of you, Maurice, I just know it.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.708
I'm going to need some working capital.

22:19.708 --> 22:23.417
It will be along with the hard drive. I take it £10k is enough?

22:23.625 --> 22:27.333
Find the girl; use every resource at your disposal, this has gone on too long.

22:27.417 --> 22:33.333
Be very aware Morris; fiddle the figures or fuck me over
and I'll make your life an absolute living hell.

24:46.125 --> 24:49.458
So she was like around for three to four days,
but John felt the need to move her on.

24:49.583 --> 24:50.750
Who's John?

24:50.833 --> 24:52.042
Our boss.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.042
What do you mean move her on?

24:56.042 --> 25:03.667
Well, either she's shit, or she's so fucking hot he had to move her onto the big hitters.
Thats like working with businessmen, celebrities, that sort of shit.

25:04.542 --> 25:05.833
Are you sure this is her?

25:06.042 --> 25:13.125
Look, I'd know her anywhere, she's the most professional amateur
I've ever seen. Took to it like a duck in water. Her name is Jo init?

25:13.417 --> 25:14.958
I don't know. Maybe?

25:15.958 --> 25:17.958
How do I get in touch with John?

25:18.250 --> 25:21.417
You don't. Look if knows I've spoke to you he'll break my face.

25:22.250 --> 25:25.750
Look, last year, when I got picked up by the filth, didn't say a word.

25:26.167 --> 25:28.167
But John broke four of my ribs anyway.

25:30.458 --> 25:36.458
Look, you can't just walk in there and talk to John, you need to get round him somehow.

25:38.167 --> 25:39.917
Alight, here is your money.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.417
Thank You.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.458
Don't spend it all in one place.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.917
You joking? I'm pregnant again, that's where this is going.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.250
How old are you?

25:47.250 --> 25:49.458
Good question, er sixteen?

25:49.542 --> 25:50.458
Really?

25:50.583 --> 25:53.500
Oh no I might be fifteen, I lose track of dates sometimes.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.833
Angel.

25:57.375 --> 26:02.125
Your a beautiful girl, you lovely, no, your lovely.

26:02.792 --> 26:06.417
Your really beautiful and really lovely, now listen.

26:06.583 --> 26:12.500
You got to find a way out of this, I mean you don't have to be doing
this you should be with someone else someone nice.

26:13.708 --> 26:17.667
It's easy to say when you have options.
When you get to my stage you don't have any options.

26:17.750 --> 26:23.542
Options, you've got options. You see those fucking birds they
haven't got fucking options, they're in a fucking cage.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.333
I ain't got, you got options.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.750
So start again.

26:35.375 --> 26:41.500
My dad sneaked into my room when I was nine.
My life was ruined the day he touched me.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.167
Not everyone is disgusting.

26:46.167 --> 26:50.667
No they're not, not everyone is disgusting not everyone stinks.

26:52.042 --> 26:54.208
There some nice people out there and you should start meeting them.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.708
All you need is a break.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.708
You just need a good break.

27:01.708 --> 27:03.708
Are you blind?

27:04.042 --> 27:07.875
Do you walk around the street with your eyes closed?
There are scumbags everywhere.

27:07.917 --> 27:13.125
And all over the country in homes, parents are fucking
their children, all covering this sort of shit up.

27:15.083 --> 27:19.792
Look, just do me a favour alright? Next time your on the streets, take a good hard look.

27:19.792 --> 27:23.417
Life is shit, and when your out their you'll realise.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.708
It was nice to meet you.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.458
Sally.

28:52.458 --> 28:56.125
Sally, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

28:56.125 --> 29:00.667
So sorry, I'm so sorry baby, I'm so sorry. I'll talk to him alrlight, I'll sort this out.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.542
I can't do this anymore.

29:04.417 --> 29:07.583
It's been five days this week and my insides are hurting.

29:08.917 --> 29:10.417
How could you let it go this far?

29:10.417 --> 29:13.708
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll sort this out, alright?

29:14.917 --> 29:17.958
I'll sort this, ill sort it.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.750
You, what did you put through my letterbox.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.542
What are you doing you fucking nutter, nothing, what's a matter with you.

30:31.542 --> 30:32.917
Whats happening?

30:32.958 --> 30:34.958
Well you better have a look.

30:49.292 --> 30:51.292
Where did this come from?

30:51.583 --> 30:52.875
I don't fucking know do I Paul?

30:53.083 --> 30:53.875
Do you know what this means sally?

30:53.875 --> 30:56.750
Yeah. It's either her or some sick fuck is trying to blackmail us.

30:57.583 --> 30:58.250
We got to destroy this.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.375
No. Because it might be a sign.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.000
A sign we do not need.

31:02.167 --> 31:06.458
We know nothing more now than what we knew this morning.
What we do know is someone knows something about us.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.792
We got to get rid.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.333
(Phone Rings)

31:24.958 --> 31:26.208
Hello?

31:28.292 --> 31:29.542
Hello?

31:32.667 --> 31:34.417
Jodie is that you?

31:36.125 --> 31:38.125
Come home now yeah?

31:39.250 --> 31:41.250
I'll get you through this?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.750
I need you home.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.833
We need you home.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.333
Working late again Paul.

32:16.667 --> 32:17.583
Yeah.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.292
Any news?

32:22.292 --> 32:24.125
No, nothing.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.125
It must be so hard.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.792
Well its certainly not easy.

32:30.792 --> 32:33.125
You know thats the most you've said to me in a year.

32:34.833 --> 32:35.958
Is it?

32:37.125 --> 32:39.125
I miss you.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.417
Yeah I miss me to.

32:42.417 --> 32:47.583
We need you back Paul, she may never come back?

32:47.750 --> 32:49.750
We all miss you.

32:50.042 --> 32:55.208
Maybe its time to move forward, your both young enough you could start again?

32:58.542 --> 33:00.458
But we would have to adopt.

33:00.875 --> 33:05.375
Sally had to have a hysterectomy after Jodie they were complications.

33:09.375 --> 33:11.375
Fancy a cuppa?

33:12.250 --> 33:14.125
Nah I better get on.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.792
Oh come on.

33:23.875 --> 33:31.917
Now I never told you this they are redundancies due,
and your name is banded about. You need this job.

33:32.042 --> 33:32.958
Yeah.

33:32.958 --> 33:40.625
Well I've told them all about the overtime your doing put in a good word,
but I cant help you any further unless you help yourself.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.042
What do I need to do?

33:43.542 --> 33:48.042
You need to let go. Move on and up your game here.

33:52.417 --> 33:53.833
Yeah

33:54.042 --> 33:56.042
You can do it.

34:42.625 --> 34:44.333
So, Sally, tell me about your week.

34:44.583 --> 34:50.667
Usual work, stressed, random strangers shouting at me in the street.

34:51.583 --> 34:53.375
Normal week then?

34:53.875 --> 34:54.583
Hm.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.583
And sex?

34:57.708 --> 35:02.708
Still nothing, but I miss him, so much.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.375
I'm starting to wonder if jodie was the only thing keeping us together.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.000
Have you tried making the first move?

35:10.708 --> 35:14.958
Of course I have, dozens of times its fucking disastrous.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.542
Do you still suspect him of cheating?

35:19.542 --> 35:21.542
I don't think he's got it in him.

35:23.125 --> 35:24.958
I'm the one with the temptation.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.750
Really, tell me about it.

35:29.708 --> 35:36.875
I look around, I see it everywhere sex, romance. I
want sex, I want it in a loving way.

35:37.625 --> 35:39.458
I want to feel like a woman again.

35:39.458 --> 35:45.083
You need to talk to Paul, the only way you can
change is through clear lines of communication.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.333
I know but its hard.

35:48.333 --> 35:50.333
How you feeling about Jodie.

35:55.708 --> 35:57.708
I want to know why?

35:58.125 --> 36:00.125
It's killing us.

36:02.708 --> 36:05.458
I think we both know the answer to that Sally.

36:11.458 --> 36:14.958
I trust our conversations are always in confidence Doctor Spencer.

36:17.667 --> 36:20.125
Even if I wanted to say something I couldn't.

36:20.125 --> 36:23.042
Good, then you will remember that.

36:24.458 --> 36:30.583
Sounds like a threat Sally, you don't need to remind me of protocol.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.042
Hello Sally.

36:54.042 --> 36:55.333
Julian.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.583
It's pay day I'm afraid.

36:56.583 --> 37:00.625
Well I thought it might be, maybe try be a little nicer today, yeah?

37:00.833 --> 37:06.833
You owe me money I'm been more than nice, now get in the fucking house.

37:20.417 --> 37:27.542
This might be a little upsetting for you both, but you've got to see it.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
Is that your daughter on the photo?

37:43.458 --> 37:44.417
Yeah.

37:47.000 --> 37:57.208
We have very good reason to believe that your daughter may well
be involved in a porn ring, that produce rape videos.

38:00.958 --> 38:06.458
Now I want you both to take your time, have a real good look, and tell me.

38:06.458 --> 38:09.792
Do you recognise any of the men in this photo?

38:10.167 --> 38:10.833
No.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.708
Mr Bryant?

38:17.583 --> 38:18.292
No.

38:18.667 --> 38:19.667
Look.

38:20.042 --> 38:23.667
I'm sorry to bring in this bombshell to your door in such a way.

38:24.542 --> 38:29.292
But this here give great hope hope that your daughter may still be alive.

38:30.042 --> 38:33.250
Which is a huge positive we must draw from this.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.000
Have you received anything?

38:36.833 --> 38:37.833
Nothing.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.917
Well we think you might.

38:41.333 --> 38:46.375
When information like this get leaked. Well there's purpose behind it.

38:47.208 --> 38:51.042
Well if we do then you'll be the first to know wont you.

38:51.250 --> 38:55.333
Much appreciated Miss, and I thank you both for your time.

38:58.167 --> 39:02.667
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for the both of you.

39:02.875 --> 39:07.083
I'll arrange a councillor to contact you as soon a possible.

39:07.833 --> 39:11.292
These things, well there best talked through.

39:12.542 --> 39:18.042
Well, good day to you both, and I'll be in touch, right.

39:20.375 --> 39:21.083
Ill see you out.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.625
Thank you, bye, bye.

39:58.458 --> 39:59.167
Yeah?

39:59.167 --> 40:07.708
Morning sir, sorry for the inconvenience I'm from the gas board we've had reports
of a leak in the area. I've got to check all the properties, absolute nonsense innit eh?

40:09.417 --> 40:10.708
Well can you come back later?

40:10.792 --> 40:18.500
Now unfortunately sir, due to severity of the situation if I'm
not given immediate access, I'll have to call the police.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.083
(Scoffs)

40:21.375 --> 40:24.250
Fuck sakes, whatever come in and do whatever you got to do.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.917
Thank you sir.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.750
So how do you know there's a leak then?

40:38.417 --> 40:40.417
Well there doesn't actually seem to be one.

40:42.667 --> 40:45.167
I don't suppose you've got any other properties in the area?

40:46.333 --> 40:49.292
Yeah, got a house up the street I rent out to a couple of girls.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.417
Oh yeah, what numbers that then?

40:52.208 --> 40:53.292
Thirty three.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.750
I should really check that out as well.

41:07.292 --> 41:07.750
John

41:07.750 --> 41:14.583
Shit. Look ill just let you in yeah. The inlet is under the
kitchen sink and the boiler is in the bedroom at the front.

41:17.792 --> 41:21.375
Oh and stay out the bedroom at the top because Jo's asleep

42:43.750 --> 42:45.750
So you found what your looking for?

42:45.958 --> 42:46.750
Eh?

42:47.083 --> 42:48.292
Maurice.

42:48.583 --> 42:49.292
What?

42:49.292 --> 42:50.000
Huh?

42:50.542 --> 42:51.625
No

42:52.042 --> 42:54.042
I ain't got time for you bullshit games.

42:56.292 --> 42:58.292
I know who you are and what your up to.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.708
Your in way over your head little man.

43:01.500 --> 43:08.375
Don't want to spend the rest of your miserable days on a ventilator
and shitting in a bag I suggest you fuck off and stop following me around.

43:08.750 --> 43:09.458
Do you understand?

43:09.667 --> 43:11.042
I understand you.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.375
Well fucking do one then.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.917
Sally!

43:32.000 --> 43:32.750
Guess what?

43:33.042 --> 43:33.958
What?

43:34.167 --> 43:35.167
No guesss you ain't going to believe it.

43:35.333 --> 43:37.000
Well I cant guess Paul.

43:37.417 --> 43:43.417
Ten people got made redundant today, but not me I got
a promotion. That promotion comes with a pay rise.

43:44.292 --> 43:47.208
A pay rise big enough to pay all of Julians costs.

43:50.417 --> 43:53.417
No more suffering it's all over, its all over.

43:53.417 --> 43:55.417
It's all over. I love you.

43:55.708 --> 43:56.583
Love you.

43:56.583 --> 43:57.833
Love you, I'll go see him now shall I?

43:57.833 --> 43:58.542
Yeah

44:15.208 --> 44:18.125
Ah Paul what an unexpected visit.

44:18.250 --> 44:19.292
I got good news.

44:19.333 --> 44:19.708
And?

44:19.833 --> 44:22.000
I've had a pay rise at work.

44:22.042 --> 44:24.083
That means I can make your monthly payments on time with interest.

44:25.708 --> 44:29.958
Well that is fantastic news, but you do know I need to be paid this month.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.667
Please mate give me a break.

44:32.833 --> 44:36.083
I'm not totally unreasonable you know but
you do seem to have got off other lightly.

44:36.083 --> 44:40.042
Maybe, just maybe you could make the repayment this month?

44:41.500 --> 44:42.792
What do you want me to do?

44:43.917 --> 44:45.000
Same as Sally.

44:45.833 --> 44:46.292
What?

44:46.625 --> 44:48.583
You heard.

44:48.708 --> 44:49.833
Don't be fucking ridiculous.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.917
Don't fucking talk to me like that you soppy cunt.

45:14.167 --> 45:21.917
Okay class and thats it. Don't forget on Monday
I need your essays on the pond life of urban gardens.

45:24.875 --> 45:26.875
Have a good weekend everybody.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.792
Pond life.

45:55.708 --> 45:57.000
Well that's appropriate.

45:57.542 --> 45:59.292
Haven't seen you in a while.

45:59.417 --> 46:01.875
Well you know.

46:02.500 --> 46:04.667
So how's things?

46:05.458 --> 46:07.792
We're moving on, who's the girl?

46:09.583 --> 46:10.708
Girl?

46:10.708 --> 46:14.208
Ah, her names Amy. What do you want?

46:14.667 --> 46:15.333
A chat.

46:15.500 --> 46:16.167
About what?

46:16.458 --> 46:17.250
Things.

46:17.667 --> 46:19.667
Well can you be a little bit more specific.

46:20.750 --> 46:25.500
I slept well last night, for the first time in over a year.

46:28.125 --> 46:30.125
How well do you sleep Tim.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.583
Like a baby.

46:33.625 --> 46:35.625
Like a baby?

46:36.292 --> 46:37.417
Just get to the point.

46:37.542 --> 46:39.083
I think I just did.

46:39.208 --> 46:40.583
What and thats it?

46:40.625 --> 46:42.208
Yeah.

46:42.958 --> 46:45.125
What do you want you cunt.

46:45.667 --> 46:48.625
Oh Tim, is that the best your going to do?

46:48.625 --> 46:50.625
What do you fucking want?

46:50.667 --> 46:55.833
I want nothing more than for you to know I exist, I will continue to exist.

46:57.583 --> 46:59.583
What and thats it?

46:59.625 --> 47:01.625
Yeah, like I said that's it.

47:02.167 --> 47:04.167
There's more to this.

47:06.875 --> 47:08.875
How do you feel Tim?

47:09.792 --> 47:11.792
How do you really feel?

47:12.708 --> 47:14.708
How do you mean?

47:15.792 --> 47:17.792
Do you miss us?

47:19.625 --> 47:28.208
I think of you often, but its all in the past we need
to move forward with our lives, separately.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
They can't get much more separate can they?

47:34.792 --> 47:39.250
Look you can't just turn up for the first time in ages and try to intimidate me.

47:39.250 --> 47:46.583
I've got responsibilities. I've got a career. You've got your own concerns,
so stick to your own life and stay out of mine.

47:47.542 --> 47:49.542
Our lives are intwined Tim.

47:50.750 --> 47:54.167
What do you want you fucking bitch.

47:56.500 --> 47:57.792
You should know something.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.167
What?

47:59.333 --> 48:00.583
We've received stuff.

48:00.792 --> 48:01.833
Stuff?

48:01.958 --> 48:03.250
Yeah stuff.

48:03.333 --> 48:04.875
Be more specific.

48:05.875 --> 48:11.458
We received some DVD's with some very choice imagery on.

48:13.542 --> 48:15.542
Look after yourself Tim.

48:32.875 --> 48:34.875
What's the matter?

48:38.375 --> 48:40.375
I went to see an old friend today.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.500
A friend, friend.

48:45.833 --> 48:47.833
Who?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.292
Tim Taylor

48:49.375 --> 48:51.375
What!

48:51.542 --> 48:53.542
I know.

48:58.917 --> 49:00.958
Do you not understand?

49:01.792 --> 49:04.625
We can't be the only ones to feel like this.

49:05.417 --> 49:08.917
We've suffered enough look, its time to share the burden.

49:09.292 --> 49:10.375
Don't see him again.

49:10.625 --> 49:18.458
I'm sorry, but all I can see is them swanning around living their
lives freely and knowing their part of the reason of why this happened?

49:18.625 --> 49:19.458
Sally. We have to...

49:20.417 --> 49:22.125
(Phone tings)

49:25.250 --> 49:27.250
Where's the phone sally?

49:31.917 --> 49:33.917
Hello?

49:34.292 --> 49:36.292
Is it her?

49:39.958 --> 49:42.750
She's gone, it's her.

49:44.083 --> 49:46.083
She put the phone down when she heard your voice, but.

49:46.375 --> 49:47.833
What did she say?

49:48.000 --> 49:49.875
She said she loves us.

49:49.917 --> 49:56.458
She said she's sorry, and she said she's coming home.

49:57.667 --> 49:59.667
It's definately her.

49:59.958 --> 50:00.750
Yeah.

50:03.958 --> 50:05.958
I don't like it Paul.

50:07.792 --> 50:09.375
What do you mean?

50:10.167 --> 50:14.083
DVD's, Images and now a phone call.

50:14.833 --> 50:16.833
Somethings not right Paul.

50:19.667 --> 50:22.542
You really do see the darkness in everything.

50:24.167 --> 50:28.542
I see the reality, not pink fluffy clouds like you do.

50:28.958 --> 50:34.708
So man the fuck up, look beyond the end of your nose and sort it out.

50:35.125 --> 50:37.125
I told you somethings not right.

51:01.625 --> 51:03.333
Hi guys, how we doing alright?

51:03.417 --> 51:04.458
Yeah good, you?

51:04.583 --> 51:06.083
Done your homework?

51:07.208 --> 51:09.208
Don't forget pond life of urban environments.

51:15.208 --> 51:18.000
Alright, cheers for that, thanks for that, bye.

51:21.875 --> 51:23.875
What you got planned for this weekend then?

51:24.083 --> 51:26.958
Not really much really mate, I was thinking about taking that girl out from the bookies.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.417
Oh that blonde one.

51:28.542 --> 51:29.542
The skinny blonde one.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.625
Skinny blonde one.

51:30.667 --> 51:32.333
Definitely a piece of me.

51:34.292 --> 51:36.125
This just came for you.

51:46.125 --> 51:47.667
You got to be shitting me.

51:47.833 --> 51:49.250
You alright mate?

51:49.375 --> 51:51.375
Take a look at these.

51:58.208 --> 51:59.500
One sec

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Wheres Kevin gone?

52:21.250 --> 52:27.167
Okay so as you can probably see he is a very powerful character.
Probably someone you really want to get on the wrong side of.

52:28.167 --> 52:33.208
Sorry can you just continue to read from page seventy eight
on your own, ill be back in one second.

52:40.750 --> 52:41.792
Hello there, can I help you?

52:41.833 --> 52:42.750
Mr Taylor?

52:42.750 --> 52:43.167
Yes?

52:43.208 --> 52:45.542
Hi, Kevin Donnelly from the Essex Mercury.

52:45.917 --> 52:47.917
I need to speak to you about something.

52:47.958 --> 52:49.958
Okay well I finish in about twenty minutes.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.208
It can't wait really.

52:52.250 --> 52:53.667
Okay then, what's up?

52:53.667 --> 52:55.792
I've come into the possession of some images.

52:56.875 --> 52:57.667
Images?

52:57.875 --> 53:01.667
These are images of a man clearly having sex with an underage girl.

53:07.250 --> 53:08.417
And, how can I help you?

53:08.500 --> 53:10.333
Well, these images are of you?

53:12.208 --> 53:14.417
I'm sorry? What? This is ridiculous.

53:15.875 --> 53:17.125
Take a look yourself.

53:21.125 --> 53:23.792
Look these are indeed very unpleasant photographs but,

53:23.792 --> 53:27.375
what on earth, makes your sick little head think it was me?

53:27.500 --> 53:28.542
I like body art.

53:28.958 --> 53:29.333
And?

53:30.583 --> 53:35.625
Last week, news article, sponsored swim, your tattoo.

53:39.750 --> 53:45.167
I think we better take these to the police, unless you
think we can come to some sort of arrangement?

53:45.375 --> 53:46.208
Why you here?

53:46.375 --> 53:49.958
I want the story, or I want a new car.

53:50.583 --> 53:52.750
Your a sick, sick man.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.083
And you? Well I don't know what you are.

53:56.250 --> 53:59.917
Look, these images suggest but it doesn't imply anything.

54:00.333 --> 54:02.417
They're more graphic pictures.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.125
Get out of my way.

54:04.125 --> 54:07.167
So why your running away then, eh why?

54:10.167 --> 54:12.167
Your life's ruined now Tim.

54:12.417 --> 54:15.833
What you say now might go in your favour for the publics perception.

54:15.833 --> 54:18.125
Fuck perception and fuck you.

54:19.167 --> 54:20.583
I'm going to the police right now.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.625
Good now fuck off.

54:23.417 --> 54:25.250
Who was the girl?

54:25.417 --> 54:27.417
What do you expect me to say?

54:27.708 --> 54:29.583
Who and why?

54:31.708 --> 54:41.208
Her name's Amy, she's a student, why because I love her, its not wrong its just...

54:41.708 --> 54:44.917
I dont' want you to say anything you don't feel or believe.

54:44.958 --> 54:48.750
What the fuck do you care about what I want or what I feel.

54:49.083 --> 54:50.292
I want the truth.

54:50.458 --> 54:53.083
Truth? Where the fuck was your truth when you was asking for money.

54:53.542 --> 54:55.750
Don't run away cause you cant hide.

54:57.667 --> 54:58.542
Don't do it.

55:06.292 --> 55:06.833
Hello?

55:06.833 --> 55:09.208
Hi, Kevin Donnelley from the Essex Mercury.

55:10.375 --> 55:12.417
I've come into the possession of some images.

55:14.958 --> 55:22.250
Mate I'd rather install a toilet camera and look at myself straining to a bitter,
nasty stubborn shite, than watch you trying to pick up a bird again.

55:22.250 --> 55:24.250
And what's that suppose to fucking mean?

55:25.000 --> 55:26.833
Can you not wait until their a little bit older.

55:27.042 --> 55:28.500
She said she was twenty.

55:28.667 --> 55:30.667
Twenty my fucking arse man.

55:34.458 --> 55:36.667
I should be knocking on your door and putting you away.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.625
You don't know what your missing mate.

55:38.625 --> 55:39.542
Maybe.

55:39.542 --> 55:41.500
Anyway watch and learn.

55:42.167 --> 55:44.167
This is how you deal with the likes of this.

55:52.625 --> 55:54.792
Do your fucking fly up man.

55:55.250 --> 55:56.000
We're professionals.

55:56.500 --> 56:00.042
Yeah, look front door is open, shall we go striaght in.

56:00.083 --> 56:01.500
No, stop.

56:02.250 --> 56:03.583
(Knocks on door)

56:04.208 --> 56:06.208
Let's see if he opens up first.

56:16.417 --> 56:17.833
Mr Taylor.

56:20.458 --> 56:22.708
Mr Taylor, police.

56:26.625 --> 56:28.292
Mr Taylor.

56:29.583 --> 56:31.167
(Knocks on door)

56:43.083 --> 56:46.333
Alright, we'll go In, but we'll go in slow right?

56:53.792 --> 56:56.750
No, no, shut the fucking door.

56:58.708 --> 57:00.417
(Screams)

57:18.417 --> 57:19.375
(Door bangs)

57:20.250 --> 57:23.292
This is what happens when you start dragging up the past Sally.

57:29.375 --> 57:31.250
It says he committed suicide.

57:31.250 --> 57:36.083
I never pressured him to do that, and how dare
you even think I could do something like that.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.583
We know what your capable of.

57:38.583 --> 57:40.167
What does that mean?

57:40.958 --> 57:42.958
You know exactly what that means.

57:43.833 --> 57:45.833
I swear to you I never caused this.

57:47.250 --> 57:49.250
Maybe guilt just got the better of him.

57:49.917 --> 57:50.917
Maybe.

57:56.750 --> 57:58.375
Promise me Sally.

57:59.167 --> 58:00.583
I promise.

58:08.625 --> 58:09.250
Okay.

58:14.458 --> 58:15.083
Okay.

58:17.083 --> 58:17.708
Okay.

58:23.292 --> 58:25.250
Do you think I should call the police and tell them about Jodie.

58:25.833 --> 58:26.458
No.

58:26.500 --> 58:28.167
I don't think we should risk it.

58:29.833 --> 58:30.500
Okay.

58:31.458 --> 58:35.583
The media has died down, they're not actively looking.

58:36.917 --> 58:44.333
I say we wait until she comes home, listen to
her story, and then work out what to tell the police.

1:01:47.583 --> 1:01:49.042
(Knocks at the door)

1:01:54.708 --> 1:01:56.000
It's a bit early.

1:01:56.625 --> 1:02:03.000
Sorry to both you Mrs Bryant, I've been told to pop
by and ask you a few quick questions if thats okay.

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.875
Did you know a Mr Timothy Taylor.

1:02:08.083 --> 1:02:09.250
The guy from the paper.

1:02:09.250 --> 1:02:10.500
Aye thats right.

1:02:10.542 --> 1:02:12.167
No, I dont think I did.

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:14.292
He was a teacher.

1:02:14.542 --> 1:02:17.833
Yeah I read that, but not at my daughters schools so why would I know him?

1:02:19.167 --> 1:02:20.542
Do you know if your daughter knew him?

1:02:21.417 --> 1:02:23.417
No of course she didnt, what a stupid question.

1:02:25.708 --> 1:02:27.542
Thanks very much for your time Mrs Bryant.

1:02:27.542 --> 1:02:29.542
We'll be in touch in a day or two.

1:02:29.625 --> 1:02:34.083
Thanks for your time? You've just come to my house
to ask me questions and now your going to leave?

1:02:36.167 --> 1:02:39.750
Sorry but if you know of no real connections just helps narrow down our enquiries.

1:02:39.917 --> 1:02:41.375
Why would their be a connection?

1:02:41.375 --> 1:02:45.542
I don't have all the details Mrs Bryant, that will be all for now.

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:48.917
Right, I'll see you out.

1:02:49.125 --> 1:02:50.083
Alright.

1:03:07.167 --> 1:03:09.167
I've just had the police round.

1:03:18.250 --> 1:03:20.958
Hello my name is Leanne Johnson

1:03:21.333 --> 1:03:23.333
I heard you've been looking for a girl called Jo.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:26.875
I can give you information of where she is.

1:03:30.667 --> 1:03:32.125
Is that the girl?

1:03:33.250 --> 1:03:33.625
Yeah.

1:03:33.667 --> 1:03:34.000
You sure.

1:03:34.125 --> 1:03:34.750
That's her.

1:03:35.542 --> 1:03:36.125
So.

1:03:39.792 --> 1:03:41.458
Tell me about her.

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:44.542
She turned up about a year, year and half ago.

1:03:45.750 --> 1:03:51.167
She was young, nieve looking, but she had a way about her.

1:03:52.083 --> 1:03:54.333
She knew what it took to satisfy a client.

1:03:54.333 --> 1:03:57.833
I've done this for six years and its not the kind of stuff I would do.

1:04:01.292 --> 1:04:02.625
What sort of stuff?

1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:08.042
Scat, fisting you name it, its yours

1:04:08.417 --> 1:04:12.292
But you also get good clients, just had to be prepared for any eventuality.

1:04:13.250 --> 1:04:14.375
I can't do that.

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:21.125
If I got back to client room and he wants double
penetration with another party or parties.

1:04:21.250 --> 1:04:24.583
I'd have to step back, these people you can't step back from.

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:27.208
Shes just a kid.

1:04:27.875 --> 1:04:29.542
Shes an adult she just looks young.

1:04:29.542 --> 1:04:31.708
No she's just a kid, shes fifteen.

1:04:33.542 --> 1:04:34.083
Fuck.

1:04:34.333 --> 1:04:35.000
Exactly.

1:04:35.833 --> 1:04:39.125
Look mate I'm not been funny but what sort of shit has this girl been through.

1:04:39.667 --> 1:04:42.375
The first time a bloke put a cock in my mouth I nearly passed out.

1:04:43.625 --> 1:04:45.625
She does some real hardcore shit.

1:04:47.042 --> 1:04:49.250
How does a fifteen year old girl get that fucked up.

1:04:49.250 --> 1:04:50.167
I dont konw.

1:04:52.667 --> 1:04:54.667
I think she was sexually abused by a teacher.

1:04:56.250 --> 1:04:58.250
Who recently committed suicide.

1:04:59.917 --> 1:05:01.542
You can't trust nobody.

1:05:01.542 --> 1:05:03.958
I left home when my step dad turned on me.

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000
If I'm going to do that shit I want money for it.

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:10.625
But I'm sensible I own my own home, I've got kids.

1:05:10.708 --> 1:05:16.250
These two lives are separate, no body knows
what I do, and I only work up town or on the coast.

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.250
When you knew her, where was she?

1:05:20.833 --> 1:05:22.833
Knew her? I know her.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000
I know everything about her.

1:05:25.875 --> 1:05:28.792
I even know where she will be Tuesday night,
because that's divvy up day.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:30.833
Where?

1:05:31.708 --> 1:05:33.000
Are you not forgetting something?

1:05:33.417 --> 1:05:34.083
What?

1:05:34.125 --> 1:05:39.167
The price, this information comes at you for a cost.
What is this worth to you?

1:05:40.458 --> 1:05:42.458
You're a streetwise kid I'll give you that.

1:05:42.542 --> 1:05:43.667
You have to be.

1:05:46.375 --> 1:05:47.000
Alright.

1:05:49.250 --> 1:05:52.292
I'll give you a thousand pounds if you can guarantee what you say is true.

1:05:54.458 --> 1:05:59.208
I will give you another three grand if you can set up a meet with her.

1:06:00.458 --> 1:06:06.417
Alright, I'm going to get you two together.
Three grand should keep me straight for three months.

1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:10.917
I'll need to lie low for a bit, if I deliver this.

1:06:11.917 --> 1:06:13.917
John is the guy who runs things around here.

1:06:15.125 --> 1:06:18.167
He takes no prisoners. But I need something from you too.

1:06:18.292 --> 1:06:18.958
What?

1:06:20.167 --> 1:06:26.583
I have information on John, I need to make sure
that it gets to the police. I need him out of the way.

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.792
I've met John, he needs to be out the way.

1:06:31.875 --> 1:06:36.292
Alright, lets set this up then. Mr Magoo.

1:06:47.583 --> 1:06:49.583

1:06:51.083 --> 1:06:53.333
No. Why would I do that?

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:55.667

1:06:56.083 --> 1:06:58.083

1:07:00.667 --> 1:07:02.667
Oh, are those wage slips in yet?

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000
No, post don't come till twelve.

1:07:12.417 --> 1:07:14.375
You just dont see it do you?

1:07:14.375 --> 1:07:15.042

1:07:17.667 --> 1:07:20.292
I know you were about to split from Sally and I'm here for you.

1:07:23.708 --> 1:07:25.208
I want you Paul.

1:07:25.292 --> 1:07:27.042
Oi Simone I can't.

Yeah good, good. Not interrupting anything am I?

1:07:34.167 --> 1:07:34.833
No.

1:07:34.875 --> 1:07:35.542
No.

1:07:37.583 --> 1:07:40.250
In fact Simone was just telling me how much she likes you.

1:07:40.583 --> 1:07:41.708
(They laugh)

1:07:41.833 --> 1:07:43.000
He's such a liar.

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:44.917
Well you know you've either got it or

1:07:45.250 --> 1:07:46.042

(Paul laughs)

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:52.667
No seriously I think you two should get together.

1:07:54.292 --> 1:07:55.417
(Simone fakes a laugh)

1:07:55.667 --> 1:07:57.667
No, my mum would kill me.

1:07:58.417 --> 1:08:00.167
Why? Whats wrong with me?

1:08:00.542 --> 1:08:06.958
Well, it's a religion thing isn't it, well I suppose
what she doesn't know wont hurt her.

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:08.625
(Simon slaps Raj and laughs)

1:08:08.750 --> 1:08:10.750
Such a flirt Raj.

1:08:11.375 --> 1:08:13.375
Right I'll leave you boys to it.

1:08:15.375 --> 1:08:19.167
Oh Paul, do you want me to keep hold of your wage slip for you?

1:08:19.458 --> 1:08:21.458
No, thanks Simone.

1:08:23.417 --> 1:08:25.292
Just leave it with the others.

1:08:25.292 --> 1:08:29.125
Alright cool, see you later.

1:08:34.667 --> 1:08:35.917
No.

1:09:03.292 --> 1:09:06.042
A million miles from offering to eat pussy in a pub.

1:09:06.958 --> 1:09:07.667
Sorry?

1:09:07.875 --> 1:09:09.333

1:09:38.167 --> 1:09:39.708

1:09:40.083 --> 1:09:42.583
Er, well Sally wants to know where mummy is?

1:09:43.542 --> 1:09:44.458

1:09:45.833 --> 1:09:48.333
Little bit early in the day for that sory of language Rory.

1:09:49.292 --> 1:09:51.542

It's okay, we're fine.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:00.500
(Laughs)

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:01.792

1:10:02.167 --> 1:10:03.750

Oh look I'm sure Sally is really busy.

1:10:10.667 --> 1:10:12.667

1:10:12.958 --> 1:10:15.417
Don't worry about him I am the boss.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:16.542
(Laughs)

1:10:16.625 --> 1:10:18.208
Yes I can see this.

1:10:18.250 --> 1:10:18.792

1:10:42.708 --> 1:10:44.625
Good. Really good.

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.750

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:51.708
Saying that, Julian is due tonight.

1:10:51.917 --> 1:10:53.917
Fuck yeah, I forgot the money.

1:10:53.958 --> 1:10:55.625
I'll go to the cash point.

1:11:53.750 --> 1:11:54.625
(Knock at the door)

1:11:57.583 --> 1:11:59.000
Sally.

1:12:02.167 --> 1:12:03.833
Make yourself at home.

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:07.542
Paul's just gone to the cash point to draw out the rest of this months payment.

1:12:07.542 --> 1:12:10.708
Well if he can't find the cash im sure we can work something out.

1:12:11.208 --> 1:12:13.083
I think you've had enough perks.

1:12:15.167 --> 1:12:17.667
And there was me thinking I was doing you a favour.

1:12:19.125 --> 1:12:23.000
Thanks for that Julian they always say rapes a favour.

1:12:24.292 --> 1:12:25.083
(Laughs)

1:12:25.083 --> 1:12:30.417
Please Sally, please, when we entered into this arrangement you knew
what the stakes were and you happily took on that commitment.

1:12:30.458 --> 1:12:38.083
Yes, didn't we just, but now do yourself a favour
and shut up, because I'm sick of your shit.

1:12:40.458 --> 1:12:41.500
(Door opens)

1:12:53.125 --> 1:12:54.542
Julian.

1:12:54.583 --> 1:12:55.958
Paul.

1:12:56.042 --> 1:12:58.042
How's your bum, little bit sore?

1:12:59.583 --> 1:13:01.417
There's your money now fuck off.

1:13:05.167 --> 1:13:09.625

1:13:21.625 --> 1:13:27.583
Ah Paul, I might have some news regarding Jodie

1:13:27.833 --> 1:13:28.958
Really?

1:13:29.083 --> 1:13:34.250
Yeah. If she does come home try keeping hold of her this time.

1:13:59.792 --> 1:14:05.417
Don't move! Stay on the floor, stay on the floor, identify yourself.

1:14:05.583 --> 1:14:06.625
Identify yourself.

1:14:07.625 --> 1:14:08.667
Paul Bryant.

1:14:08.667 --> 1:14:13.958
Paul Bryant your under arrest, you have the right to remain silent any thing
you do say maybe given in evidence against you in court.

1:14:18.417 --> 1:14:20.417
So this is like our second date.

1:14:21.708 --> 1:14:23.208
This is not a date.

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:24.167
(Laughs)

1:14:24.333 --> 1:14:26.333
This is two friends chilling.

1:14:26.833 --> 1:14:33.167
So we are friends? But you know everything there is
to know about me and I know nothing about you.

1:14:34.417 --> 1:14:35.292
Nothing to tell.

1:14:35.292 --> 1:14:37.458
You've got nothing, nothing at all.

1:14:39.125 --> 1:14:45.375
I'm single, divorced, no kids, I like ice cream, thats it.

1:14:47.625 --> 1:14:48.625
Boyfriends?

1:14:48.625 --> 1:14:49.667
Alright.

1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:52.958
No boyfriend.

1:14:55.667 --> 1:14:57.667
So what did happen with your husband.

1:15:01.750 --> 1:15:03.583
He let me down.

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:07.083
Lets change the subject eh?

1:15:08.083 --> 1:15:10.083
Yeah sorry I shouldn't have asked.

1:15:11.750 --> 1:15:13.375
You know what we need.

1:15:13.583 --> 1:15:14.292
No.

1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:16.500
Hey Rory, come here.

1:15:18.750 --> 1:15:21.167
Sally is feeling down, what do you think we need?

1:15:21.708 --> 1:15:23.083
Ice Cream.

1:15:23.208 --> 1:15:24.583
Yes, ice cream.

1:15:44.750 --> 1:15:46.458
You sure shes going to turn up?

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:48.708
You're a client, she's a pro.

1:15:49.917 --> 1:15:51.417
The only issue will be if John comes with her.

1:15:51.625 --> 1:15:53.000
Does he do that

1:15:53.250 --> 1:15:55.125
You're a new client it's a possibility.

1:15:55.417 --> 1:15:57.417
Fuck, Fuck, Fuck.

1:15:57.833 --> 1:16:02.042
Look it might not even happen just sit tight, whats the time?

1:16:02.167 --> 1:16:03.833
About 7:58 I think.

1:16:03.875 --> 1:16:05.875
Two minutes she wont be late.

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:07.667
I hope you got the right girl.

1:16:08.417 --> 1:16:09.875
It's her I told you.

1:16:11.042 --> 1:16:12.333
Here look.

1:16:13.875 --> 1:16:15.000

1:16:19.917 --> 1:16:21.208
Are you going to stay here?

1:16:21.208 --> 1:16:23.000
Yes I want my cash.

1:16:25.292 --> 1:16:26.750
Alright, sit tight.

1:16:31.375 --> 1:16:33.375

Okay, so we have a little house keeping to care of, cash up-front, we do whatever
you want but you have to tell me what's happening. Any surprises, this ends.

1:16:53.667 --> 1:16:56.042
I have a panic alarm, and someone in the room next door.

1:16:57.458 --> 1:16:59.458
Can we talk?

1:16:59.875 --> 1:17:01.458
First time Pete?

1:17:01.875 --> 1:17:05.208
No, yes, working girl yes, first time.

1:17:06.750 --> 1:17:07.708
Cash.

1:17:19.667 --> 1:17:21.667
Put the money on the side.

1:17:32.042 --> 1:17:34.042
Now rub my clit.

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:35.625
Excuse me?

1:17:43.667 --> 1:17:45.042
Really?

1:17:45.208 --> 1:17:46.375
Yeah.

1:17:55.333 --> 1:17:56.708
Now can we talk?

1:17:57.250 --> 1:17:59.000
You've paid now we do whatever you want?

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:06.125
I've got a message for you, I'll give you the message and then I'll leave,
and we're done and you'll never see me again.

1:18:06.542 --> 1:18:08.542
I dont like the sound of this but go ahead.

1:18:12.417 --> 1:18:13.458
Listen Jodie.

1:18:13.625 --> 1:18:14.708
Who the fuck are you?

1:18:14.875 --> 1:18:16.875
Two minutes, just give me two minutes, I'm sorry.

1:18:18.458 --> 1:18:22.083
I work for a very powerful man, your mum and dad are in big trouble.

1:18:22.167 --> 1:18:23.292
Dad?

1:18:23.917 --> 1:18:25.417
And your mum.

1:18:25.583 --> 1:18:26.625
Carry On.

1:18:26.875 --> 1:18:29.667
If you don’t go home soon, things are going to get worse.

1:18:30.958 --> 1:18:35.625
They're in a lot of trouble they owe a lot of money.
Your dad has just been released on bail for attacking girls.

1:18:35.833 --> 1:18:37.292
I'm not ready yet.

1:18:37.417 --> 1:18:38.833
What you need time for?

1:18:39.167 --> 1:18:41.792
Preperation, do you know what your dealing with here?

1:18:41.917 --> 1:18:43.917
Julian, I guess?

1:18:45.042 --> 1:18:47.042
Yeah.

1:18:48.458 --> 1:18:50.458
Your way older than you years ain't you?

1:18:50.667 --> 1:18:52.292
I need to be.

1:18:52.333 --> 1:18:54.500
Can I do anything to make it easier for you to go home?

1:18:55.042 --> 1:18:58.625
No, I just need time to think, I've already paid a visit briefly.

1:19:01.292 --> 1:19:03.083
Do you need any cash?

1:19:03.083 --> 1:19:04.708
No I do alright thanks, anything else?

1:19:04.875 --> 1:19:09.167
No, thats it, you just go home.

1:19:10.375 --> 1:19:12.542
Okay, so you need to stay here for at least ten minutes, alright?

1:19:13.542 --> 1:19:14.667
Why?

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:17.667
Because this is how it works. I leave, the punter normally has a shower.

1:19:18.208 --> 1:19:24.708
Here look, take my card incase you need to reach me.

1:19:25.333 --> 1:19:27.333
And can I ask you one last question?

1:19:28.083 --> 1:19:28.667
Go on

1:19:28.750 --> 1:19:32.500
Why? Why did you go, why are you doing this?

1:19:33.292 --> 1:19:35.292
No reasons, just because.

1:19:37.083 --> 1:19:39.083
Anyway it's time to go.

1:19:48.083 --> 1:19:49.208
Maurice?

1:19:49.375 --> 1:19:51.375
You never looked like a Pete.

1:19:55.958 --> 1:19:57.083
Jodie?

1:19:57.083 --> 1:19:58.208
Yeah?

1:19:59.042 --> 1:20:00.417
Be safe.

1:20:00.583 --> 1:20:01.708
Always.

1:21:14.958 --> 1:21:16.125
(Phone rings)

1:21:32.375 --> 1:21:33.875
Fuck.

1:21:42.542 --> 1:21:43.917
Julian?

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.958
Julian? What you got me into?

1:21:46.292 --> 1:21:48.000
Just do your job?

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:48.917
That poor girl.

1:21:48.917 --> 1:21:54.000
This is a world you do not understand Maurice, a world you won't want
to understand. Just do your job, and leave a richer man.

1:21:54.250 --> 1:21:55.458
She had kids.

1:21:55.917 --> 1:21:59.083
She was a whore, and now those kids have a better life.

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:00.125
Yeah, I want out.

1:22:00.125 --> 1:22:05.417
Listen to me do you understand? You are in too far.

1:22:08.333 --> 1:22:11.500
We'll clean your car and return it to you in the morning.

1:22:12.708 --> 1:22:14.375
What about her?

1:22:14.833 --> 1:22:19.583
Every year people go missing, their fates never known,
she is just another statistic Maurice.

1:22:20.542 --> 1:22:23.708
Look, I've done everything you asked, I've passed on that message.

1:22:24.083 --> 1:22:29.667
Look, consider yourself on retainer, until Jodie comes home.
When she comes home our arrangement is at an end.

1:22:31.875 --> 1:22:32.917
Okay.

1:22:33.042 --> 1:22:38.417
Now go round the corner, and Serena, my driver,
will be waiting in my car. She will bring back your car tomorrow.

1:22:38.583 --> 1:22:39.333
Okay.

1:22:42.875 --> 1:22:48.833
Maurice, one last thing. Keep your mouth shut.
If you can do that then things will be okay.

1:23:02.333 --> 1:23:04.333
When did you get out?

1:23:06.500 --> 1:23:07.417
Late.

1:23:10.292 --> 1:23:14.375
And I've got to attend a police station at 6 o'clock everynight.

1:23:14.625 --> 1:23:19.292
Great, Well done. I dont know what goes through your fucking brain sometimes.

1:23:19.458 --> 1:23:20.875
Why didnt you come and see me?

1:23:20.875 --> 1:23:29.250
Because I don't want to be associated with a man who, for the last fourteen months,
since his own daughter went missing, has been attacking girls with similarities to Jodie.

1:23:30.167 --> 1:23:32.167
How did you even get out?

1:23:32.750 --> 1:23:35.333
Varied circumstances apparently.

1:23:35.833 --> 1:23:38.708
I've got to see a court appointed psychiatrist one day a week.

1:23:39.958 --> 1:23:41.958
What you being charged with?

1:23:42.125 --> 1:23:44.917
Four counts of assault, one attempted murder. I denied it Sally.

1:23:48.625 --> 1:23:49.833
You fucked up.

1:23:49.833 --> 1:23:53.000
I don't know why I did it? Pressure? Shit with Julian?

1:23:53.792 --> 1:23:56.208
Well you made the fucking press.

1:23:57.750 --> 1:24:01.625
Kevin, that reporter who's meant to be helping us is now working against us.

1:24:02.042 --> 1:24:04.042
And he thinks you murdered Jodie.

1:24:05.042 --> 1:24:06.000
Fuck.

1:24:06.458 --> 1:24:09.625
Yeah, I think its safe to say you wont be going back to work either.

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.625
Some bird range from the office? Simone, said
to contact her first before going back to work.

1:24:17.292 --> 1:24:19.292
Who is she?

1:24:20.833 --> 1:24:22.333
One of the admin girls.

1:24:22.583 --> 1:24:24.583
Then I suggest you give her a call.

1:24:24.667 --> 1:24:25.583
Okay.

1:24:25.917 --> 1:24:27.917
Sort it out Paul.

1:24:35.917 --> 1:24:39.167
I didn't know what else to say but at least I bought you some time.

1:24:39.875 --> 1:24:40.958
Thank you.

1:24:41.167 --> 1:24:44.542
When it goes to court though, its over.

1:24:44.875 --> 1:24:46.875
They give you a date?

1:24:48.917 --> 1:24:52.083
Referred for six weeks, could be anything up to six months.

1:24:52.667 --> 1:24:54.667
And have they given you an outcome.

1:24:55.042 --> 1:25:04.792
No, well, if the murder charge gets kicked out, I will probably
get a suspended sentence psychiatric assessment.

1:25:06.708 --> 1:25:09.375
I didn't try kill anyone Simone.

1:25:13.958 --> 1:25:15.958
I just miss my little girl.

1:25:17.458 --> 1:25:25.458
I don't know what to say Paul, I mean you think you know someone,
then something like this happens. Where do you go from here?

1:25:25.667 --> 1:25:29.042
I'm still the same, I'm still Paul.

1:25:31.292 --> 1:25:35.333
Right, well, lets go see the bosses.

1:25:44.708 --> 1:25:49.542
Roy I cant thank you enough, my wife aswell. Thank you its much appreciated.

1:25:50.125 --> 1:25:51.833
Roy, thank you

1:25:51.833 --> 1:25:54.083
Donna, thank you very much.

1:26:07.125 --> 1:26:11.000
Safe for now. They even told me they'll help get around the curfew arrangements.

1:26:11.083 --> 1:26:16.333
I lied though Simone. I told them it was the first time, I denied all other times.

1:26:16.792 --> 1:26:20.208
Panicked didn't I can't be out of work.

1:26:21.167 --> 1:26:23.958
Alright, best you get home then.

1:26:24.375 --> 1:26:25.250
(Laughs)

1:26:25.417 --> 1:26:26.500
Okay.

1:26:29.708 --> 1:26:31.000
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:26:31.542 --> 1:26:32.667
See you tomorrow.

1:26:42.417 --> 1:26:44.000
What's up?

1:26:44.292 --> 1:26:46.042
See for yourself.

1:26:47.250 --> 1:26:48.625
Jodie.

1:26:48.750 --> 1:26:50.125
Jodie.

1:26:51.042 --> 1:26:52.958
Oh Jodie, thank god your home.

1:26:56.125 --> 1:26:57.250
Where have you been?

1:26:57.500 --> 1:27:00.375
I just needed to get away, I just needed time to think.

1:27:00.667 --> 1:27:03.500
But I'm back, but things change from here on out.

1:27:04.167 --> 1:27:05.958
Who do you think you're talking to?

1:27:06.125 --> 1:27:06.333
You.

1:27:06.792 --> 1:27:09.292
Don't you come back after months and start barking orders.

1:27:10.083 --> 1:27:11.708
Yeah and I missed you too mum.

1:27:11.917 --> 1:27:16.375
Can we just stop this? She's home, let's just enjoy it.

1:27:16.750 --> 1:27:20.583
Okay, what story are we concocting for the police then.

1:27:20.583 --> 1:27:23.583
I'll let you two decide that one, we know the truth.

1:27:26.792 --> 1:27:28.750
We're you pregnant?

1:27:28.750 --> 1:27:35.917
Of course not I only took precautions, anyway I've
had a long day and I'm tired I just need some sleep.

1:27:36.625 --> 1:27:38.625
We can talk about this tomorrow.

1:27:39.292 --> 1:27:40.583
(Laughs)

1:27:48.667 --> 1:27:51.042
Julian? It's Maurice, yes she's back home.

1:27:51.583 --> 1:27:53.583
Yes, about two hours ago.

1:27:55.375 --> 1:27:57.375
Wel I'm hoping this means my work is finished.

1:27:58.167 --> 1:28:00.667
Yes, and when will I get my final bit of money?

1:28:01.333 --> 1:28:03.333
Can you do a bank trasnfer?

1:28:05.167 --> 1:28:08.417
Alright thank you Julian. Yeah night.

1:28:14.083 --> 1:28:16.083

1:28:16.167 --> 1:28:17.458
Hello?

1:28:17.458 --> 1:28:19.458
Jodie, you're home.

1:28:20.250 --> 1:28:22.250
Good, yes I can meet you tonight.

1:28:22.917 --> 1:28:27.375
Oh actually can we make it the day after I need to go to the hospital tomorrow.

1:28:36.417 --> 1:28:37.958
(Knocks on door)

1:28:38.708 --> 1:28:39.750
Yeah?

1:28:40.667 --> 1:28:42.375

1:28:43.083 --> 1:28:43.958
Yeah.

1:28:48.417 --> 1:28:50.417
How are you feeling?

1:28:50.792 --> 1:28:54.458
Relaxed. Sorry I was a bit harsh last night.

1:28:54.708 --> 1:28:56.708
No, It's alright.

1:29:08.625 --> 1:29:10.625
Have you got a story?

1:29:11.042 --> 1:29:14.833
I'll just say I needed time away to think. Just needed to get away.

1:29:15.750 --> 1:29:20.583
I cant believe your home. It has been such a long time.

1:29:29.125 --> 1:29:31.000
She's out there.

1:29:31.375 --> 1:29:35.375
Anyway so, great to have you back.

1:29:36.750 --> 1:29:38.750
Morning, how are you feeling?

1:29:39.167 --> 1:29:40.083
Fine.

1:29:40.333 --> 1:29:45.000
Great. Then let's get downstairs get the story straight and call the police.

1:29:45.583 --> 1:29:47.583
I need the loo first.

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:10.500
Okay, so where did you go and why have you come back?

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.792
Hmm why the fuck do you think? You stupid bitch.

1:30:13.792 --> 1:30:14.583
Jodie.

1:30:15.042 --> 1:30:15.958
Sorry dad.

1:30:16.458 --> 1:30:17.458
Well.

1:30:17.708 --> 1:30:27.167
I had to get away. This whole thing, it's sick, it's wrong, I just had
to get away, alright? I've been out there, I know how the world works.

1:30:27.167 --> 1:30:33.458
We can get round this if we stick together.
If I go, I'm not coming back again.

1:30:34.250 --> 1:30:36.250
What we going to tell the police Paul?

1:30:39.875 --> 1:30:41.875
What about you ran away with a boyfriend?

1:30:42.375 --> 1:30:43.167
Plauseable

1:30:43.208 --> 1:30:47.875
Great, so where did you go and why did you come back?

1:30:49.792 --> 1:30:56.125
He was European, and he tricked me into leaving
and kept me almost kept me like a hostage.

1:30:57.417 --> 1:30:59.542
I dont know how you come up with these fucking stories.

1:31:00.042 --> 1:31:01.542
Hm, I wonder.

1:31:02.250 --> 1:31:06.042
Anyway call the police, come one, I just want this over with.

1:31:12.833 --> 1:31:22.208
Interview resumed, for the benefit of the video I am DCI Reece Duttomn
I am conducting this interview with DC Claire Coogan.

1:31:22.625 --> 1:31:29.042
And we are talking with one Jodie Bryant,
and her parents Paul and Sally Bryant.

1:31:31.125 --> 1:31:33.667
Jodie, do you know a Timothy Taylor?

1:31:34.667 --> 1:31:35.500
No.

1:31:35.625 --> 1:31:37.583
Are you sure?

1:31:37.583 --> 1:31:38.542
Yes.

1:31:39.667 --> 1:31:46.375
Okay. On September twenty eighth, we were called to twenty seven
Western Road to investigate a case of child abuse.

1:31:46.375 --> 1:31:54.250
The perpetrator committed suicide by elaborate means upon arrival.
When we searched his hard drive, we found a number of images.

1:31:56.292 --> 1:31:58.292
Does this bring back any memories?

1:32:12.625 --> 1:32:18.875
Listen Jodie, I know this is hard, but we have lots of
images of Mr Taylor with lots of different people.

1:32:19.042 --> 1:32:24.083
We need to know how he got people to have
sex with him, and how you met him?

1:32:24.458 --> 1:32:29.917
Jodie, if you want to leave all of this all in the
past and forget about it you can, okay?

1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:39.042
If you don't mind me saying, Mr Bryant, you seem remarkably calm for a man
who has just discovered an adult has been having sex with his daughter.

1:32:41.333 --> 1:32:46.250
My daughter has been missing for nearly 18 months and now shes home.

1:32:47.500 --> 1:32:49.167
Obviously she left for a reason.

1:32:51.208 --> 1:32:53.542
We might never understand what happened in that time.

1:32:54.625 --> 1:32:56.625
Quite frankly I don't care.

1:32:57.083 --> 1:33:00.625
That man is dead he cant hurt Jodie or anyone else.

1:33:01.208 --> 1:33:04.125
So please, can we do this another time?

1:33:04.208 --> 1:33:09.458
No, Mr. Bryant, we can't do this another time, you see, there are other images.

1:33:09.875 --> 1:33:11.000
What?

1:33:11.125 --> 1:33:13.125
Other images?

1:33:15.167 --> 1:33:18.083
Jodie do you want to tell us anything?

1:33:19.375 --> 1:33:20.083
No.

1:33:38.708 --> 1:33:39.583
Whoa!

1:33:39.708 --> 1:33:40.458
(They Laugh)

1:33:40.625 --> 1:33:41.542
Shit the bed.

1:33:41.833 --> 1:33:43.083
Well hello.

1:33:43.458 --> 1:33:44.625
It's 7AM what you doing here?

1:33:44.792 --> 1:33:46.375
What are you doing here?

1:33:46.542 --> 1:33:48.208
Well I'm meant to be here.

1:33:48.250 --> 1:33:50.250
Well your daughters home, should you be with her?

1:33:50.542 --> 1:33:52.542
No, she's catching up with her friends.

1:33:53.250 --> 1:33:55.875
Oh, well it must be lovely to have her home.

1:33:56.208 --> 1:33:58.333
Yes. Yes it really is.

1:33:58.708 --> 1:34:00.708
I feel like that pressure is lifting a bit.

1:34:04.542 --> 1:34:05.708
Okay, well I better get on with my work.

1:34:05.708 --> 1:34:06.500
Yeah.

1:34:07.417 --> 1:34:08.458
Catch you in a bit.

1:34:08.667 --> 1:34:09.708
Sure.

1:34:26.500 --> 1:34:26.958
Five.

1:34:27.125 --> 1:34:27.583
Four.

1:34:27.792 --> 1:34:28.250
Three.

1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:28.958
Two.

1:34:29.667 --> 1:34:30.125
One.

1:34:46.958 --> 1:34:48.000
What you doing in here?

1:34:48.292 --> 1:34:49.458
Looking for you.

1:34:49.708 --> 1:34:50.375
You shouldn't really be here.

1:34:50.458 --> 1:34:51.333
I should.

1:34:53.625 --> 1:34:56.000
Come on this is silly.

1:34:56.250 --> 1:34:57.083
Stop.

1:34:58.708 --> 1:34:59.458
No.

1:34:59.875 --> 1:35:01.000
Yeah, fucking stop.

1:35:01.083 --> 1:35:01.833
Simone, I love my wife.

1:35:01.958 --> 1:35:08.250
I don't care. I've been flirting with you for months now,
I do you favours; and fucking sorting you out, what's in it for me?

1:35:08.417 --> 1:35:10.583
Well, can't we just be friends?

1:35:10.583 --> 1:35:12.333
I want something back.

1:35:12.583 --> 1:35:13.583
Like what?

1:35:13.708 --> 1:35:15.125
Sex, just once.

1:35:15.167 --> 1:35:16.042
No, I cant do that.

1:35:16.208 --> 1:35:20.125
I want you inside me. Comply with me and everything goes back to normal.

1:35:20.375 --> 1:35:25.625
Defy me, and I'll tell the police you attacked me.

1:35:25.667 --> 1:35:26.292
(Laughs maniacally)

1:35:26.292 --> 1:35:27.208
You what?

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.792
No=one is here for the next ninety minutes so sit the fuck down.

1:35:31.667 --> 1:35:33.042
I don't fucking feel right about this.

1:35:33.042 --> 1:35:44.500
Right?, Fucking Right? Yes, I've wanted you for three fucking
years now, since the Christmas party; you led me on.

1:35:45.792 --> 1:35:55.583
And ow you're attacking girls, for some sort of sexual kick no doubt.
Well I've got a little kick for you, yes that's right, I'll even struggle if you like.

1:35:57.667 --> 1:35:59.792
You don't feel very excited to me Paul.

1:35:59.958 --> 1:36:02.500
I cant do this I thought we was fucking friends.

1:36:02.792 --> 1:36:04.708
Get some fucking balls and get this hard now.

1:36:04.750 --> 1:36:05.500
I can't do it, please.

1:36:05.792 --> 1:36:07.417
Just fuck me, yeah?

1:36:07.750 --> 1:36:08.292
No.

1:36:08.417 --> 1:36:10.750

1:37:52.792 --> 1:37:54.167
It's not what I've heard.

1:37:54.375 --> 1:37:56.708
That's the sort of glib comment that we'll never be friends.

1:37:56.708 --> 1:37:59.333
Glib, your ahead of your years.

1:38:00.167 --> 1:38:04.250

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:21.958
You know nothing.

1:38:22.667 --> 1:38:23.958
Tim Taylor.

1:38:24.125 --> 1:38:25.417
Police already have it all.

1:38:25.417 --> 1:38:30.208
Not all of it, I kept the best bits, best stuff.

1:38:30.417 --> 1:38:32.417
You've been through the ringer.

1:38:39.917 --> 1:38:40.875

1:39:00.333 --> 1:39:01.500

1:39:02.417 --> 1:39:03.958
Did you have a good day?

1:39:04.167 --> 1:39:05.208

1:39:05.667 --> 1:39:08.917

1:39:11.167 --> 1:39:14.583
If there is anything you need to speak about you know I'm always here.

1:39:18.875 --> 1:39:21.583
Go on, go up stairs and get ready for dinner.

1:39:41.042 --> 1:39:43.042
(Knock at the door)

1:39:46.917 --> 1:39:49.625
Oh, no, no, no.

1:39:53.792 --> 1:40:02.417
Hello Jodie, I'm Colin, and I hear you like to suck lollipops.

1:40:11.042 --> 1:40:13.042
Good, girl.

1:40:19.208 --> 1:40:23.875
My head is all bruised Paul, you'll have to make this up to me tomorrow.

1:40:24.125 --> 1:40:26.125
Stay the fuck away from me.

1:40:29.333 --> 1:40:33.292
Oh don't be like that Paul I thought we had an understanding?

1:40:33.292 --> 1:40:34.333
Fuck off.

1:40:44.375 --> 1:40:46.708
You ain't going to believe the day I've had.

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000
Try Me.

1:40:50.375 --> 1:40:57.875
That girl Simone, the girl in the admin office,
she's blackmailing me. Over that business with the girls.

1:40:58.792 --> 1:41:00.083
What does she want?

1:41:00.583 --> 1:41:02.583
She wants sex.

1:41:02.625 --> 1:41:03.708
Well fuck her then?

1:41:06.958 --> 1:41:09.542
I did, I had to.

1:41:10.875 --> 1:41:12.583
Now she wants it to carry on.

1:41:12.667 --> 1:41:17.750
You do what you need to sweetheart, because we
need people on our side until your case is done.

1:41:19.583 --> 1:41:20.417
Okay.

1:41:31.833 --> 1:41:34.208
Do you want to see something that might lighten the mood.

1:41:35.833 --> 1:41:37.083
What?

1:41:38.750 --> 1:41:44.375
I got a disk, I thought it might spice things up
considering we haven't had sex in over a year.

1:41:47.042 --> 1:41:48.625
A Jodie disk?

1:41:52.750 --> 1:41:54.250
She agreed?

1:41:54.583 --> 1:42:00.208
I didn't give her a fucking choice, we will have two new
disks by tomorrow and we can start uploading them.

1:42:03.583 --> 1:42:04.625
Okay.

1:42:06.917 --> 1:42:08.917
Everything is getting back to normal.

1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:12.167
I'm so happy.

1:42:15.625 --> 1:42:16.958
Come on.

1:42:29.792 --> 1:42:33.875
Calm down big boy, I don't want you firing off before I get a look in.

1:42:37.792 --> 1:42:43.917
(Sally moans)

1:42:47.417 --> 1:42:52.583
(Paul moans)

1:43:02.833 --> 1:43:04.000
I can't believe you fucked that cunt.

1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000
Keep your voice down.

1:43:08.208 --> 1:43:09.417
Your breaking my heart.

1:43:09.417 --> 1:43:12.333
Soon, it'll all be over soon.

1:43:12.583 --> 1:43:15.292
It makes me sick to think your doing it upstiairs with her.

1:43:15.583 --> 1:43:16.042

1:43:18.292 --> 1:43:21.583

1:43:27.625 --> 1:43:33.458
Okay so I made some arrangements today,
only what we agreed, all I need now is date.

1:43:33.875 --> 1:43:36.833
Give me a couple of days to think about it and we'll move forward.

1:43:37.792 --> 1:43:38.583
Okay.

1:43:43.625 --> 1:43:47.083

They're very sexy.

1:43:56.708 --> 1:43:58.708
Well soon you'll see them up close soon.

1:44:02.333 --> 1:44:04.250

1:44:50.625 --> 1:44:53.667

1:44:53.917 --> 1:44:55.042
I was early yesterday.

1:44:55.042 --> 1:44:58.583
Look, we going to fuck or we going to argue about this?

1:45:00.167 --> 1:45:01.708
Lets just get it over with shall we?

1:45:02.125 --> 1:45:04.458
Well you could sound a little bit more enthusiastic.

1:45:04.625 --> 1:45:05.708
Shut up.

1:45:22.292 --> 1:45:23.292
(They laugh)

1:45:30.667 --> 1:45:32.667
(Door bell rings)

1:45:34.542 --> 1:45:37.250
Sorry I forgot to mention I booked in another client for today.

1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000
That's six hundred quid she's made us this afternoon.

1:45:42.250 --> 1:45:43.333
I don't want to do it.

1:45:43.750 --> 1:45:45.750
I couldn't give a shit what you want, get up there.

1:45:50.625 --> 1:45:52.167
Hello, I'm Gary.

1:45:52.333 --> 1:45:54.333
Hello Gary, nice to meet you.

1:45:58.583 --> 1:46:00.833
Hi Maurice, so what you got?

1:46:02.750 --> 1:46:04.250
Jodie, this is John.

1:46:04.542 --> 1:46:05.375
Nice to meet you.

1:46:05.458 --> 1:46:06.708
And you.

1:46:06.708 --> 1:46:08.708
So what's the story?

1:46:09.125 --> 1:46:13.333
I lost my job two months ago down the factory, my boss was Julian.

1:46:13.708 --> 1:46:17.292
About four months ago he started picking on one of
our new kids; sixteen years old, just out of school.

1:46:17.292 --> 1:46:18.625
Let me guess.

1:46:18.750 --> 1:46:19.583
Shh.

1:46:19.833 --> 1:46:24.333
Anyway, it's late one night and I'm getting out later than normal and I hear crying.

1:46:24.333 --> 1:46:28.208
I look down one of the bits of plant and saw Julian trying to suck this kid off.

1:46:28.208 --> 1:46:32.375
I pulled Julian off him and got the kid safe. The following
day we were called to a meeting and we were all made redundant.

1:46:32.417 --> 1:46:34.417
Well theres a legal issue here.

1:46:35.167 --> 1:46:39.000
He shut the factory down and rebranded it.
Doing the same thing but under a new name.

1:46:40.625 --> 1:46:42.625
Well at least you spared another innocent, right?

1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:47.292
No we never, three days later Julian got the kid at a nightclub and raped him.

1:46:47.292 --> 1:46:51.458
The kid later withdrew his statement, but apparently has been spending a lot of cash.

1:46:51.667 --> 1:46:52.875
So what can we help you with?

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:53.667
We want him.

1:46:53.833 --> 1:46:54.458
Who?

1:46:54.750 --> 1:46:56.750
Julian.

1:46:57.958 --> 1:46:59.042
We can deliver him.

1:46:59.292 --> 1:47:00.750
Or vice-versa.

1:47:01.542 --> 1:47:02.375
Nice.

1:47:08.417 --> 1:47:09.958
Good night Kevin.

1:47:10.583 --> 1:47:12.583
Alright see you on monday.

1:47:34.167 --> 1:47:36.167
(Unbuttons trousers)

1:47:55.792 --> 1:47:57.292
I'm sorry.

1:47:57.292 --> 1:47:59.292
About the pub stuff.

1:47:59.375 --> 1:48:01.375
Yeah I thought you might be.

1:48:03.792 --> 1:48:05.208
What was it you offered to do to me again?

1:48:05.542 --> 1:48:10.875
Yeah look, was drunk I say stupid things when I'm drunk you know?

1:48:11.542 --> 1:48:13.542
I fucking loved it.

1:48:14.167 --> 1:48:15.417
(They laugh)

1:48:18.833 --> 1:48:20.833
No one has said anything like to me in years.

1:48:21.875 --> 1:48:25.708
And if we were on our own, yeah I would have fucked you.

1:48:28.417 --> 1:48:30.417
So what are we?

1:48:31.417 --> 1:48:33.417
What do you want us to be?

1:48:36.042 --> 1:48:38.042
You know what I want.

1:48:51.667 --> 1:48:55.292
Watch were your fucking going bruv, fucking dickhead.

1:49:22.750 --> 1:49:23.417

1:50:04.625 --> 1:50:06.625
What happened when you was away?

1:50:06.625 --> 1:50:11.667
Look, If I'm going to be turned into a whore, I want the money.
Okay? You two were happily living off my work.

1:50:12.333 --> 1:50:16.708
It's only fair I saved the money, got our freedom,
and now planned our escape.

1:50:18.875 --> 1:50:20.875
This needs to end now.

1:50:21.708 --> 1:50:22.833
(Phone rings)

1:50:29.042 --> 1:50:30.083

1:53:06.083 --> 1:53:10.083

1:53:11.708 --> 1:53:14.000

1:54:16.917 --> 1:54:20.500

1:54:20.875 --> 1:54:21.542
(Raj Moans)

1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.375
Oh shit.

1:54:25.875 --> 1:54:26.583
(Raj Moans)

1:54:52.625 --> 1:54:53.875

1:54:55.583 --> 1:54:56.750

1:55:01.333 --> 1:55:03.333
I'm sorry, argh.

1:55:03.917 --> 1:55:05.917
Needs must.

1:55:42.042 --> 1:55:43.250
Jodie.

1:55:44.875 --> 1:55:46.167
Please to see me?

1:55:46.292 --> 1:55:47.167
Very.

1:55:47.542 --> 1:55:48.292
How's your tea?

1:55:48.583 --> 1:55:49.875
Eh?

1:55:49.958 --> 1:55:50.917
Your tea?

1:55:50.917 --> 1:55:52.917
What you talking about?

1:55:56.125 --> 1:55:58.125
What have you done?

1:55:58.792 --> 1:56:00.792
That should be a question for you don't you think?

1:56:01.792 --> 1:56:09.208
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent, it's a paralytic, it takes days to wear off.

1:56:09.375 --> 1:56:12.292
But all you can do now is sit and watch.

1:56:12.375 --> 1:56:18.125
It's like been trapped in a prison, a bit like how I felt.

1:56:21.583 --> 1:56:23.583
Come in.

1:56:31.375 --> 1:56:33.375
Hello, boss.

1:56:33.417 --> 1:56:38.792
Me and one of the boys thought we would come and
pay you a visit, because I know you like fucking people.

1:56:40.708 --> 1:56:42.708
We thought you'd like a taste of your own medicine.

1:56:43.625 --> 1:56:46.792
I'd say hold him down, but you can't move, can you?

1:56:47.875 --> 1:56:49.875
You better go love.

1:56:53.458 --> 1:56:55.917
No, I think I'll stick this one out for a bit.

1:57:05.667 --> 1:57:06.958
(Phone rings)

1:57:10.708 --> 1:57:12.083
Hello?

1:57:12.167 --> 1:57:14.167
Hi Sally, how're you feeling?

1:57:14.292 --> 1:57:16.625
Good Clive, how can I help?

1:57:17.125 --> 1:57:22.375
I've got a new client for you, city type money to burn.
Has Jodie got a space at seven tonight?

1:57:23.708 --> 1:57:25.000
Jodie always has space.

1:57:25.208 --> 1:57:27.958
Excellent. I'll take the usual cut.

1:57:28.458 --> 1:57:32.083
Of course, good to be back in business Clive.

1:57:32.292 --> 1:57:33.792
(Door closes)

1:58:05.667 --> 1:58:08.250
It's time, let's do this now.

1:58:45.292 --> 1:58:47.292
Come on we have to be quick.

1:58:47.875 --> 1:58:52.042
Okay, I'm sorry, I just got a bit distracted.

1:58:53.917 --> 1:58:55.417
I've just got change my clothes.

1:58:56.167 --> 1:58:58.417
For fuck sake, hurry up.

1:59:05.333 --> 1:59:07.333
(Door closes)

1:59:13.333 --> 1:59:15.333
What the fuck is going on here then?

1:59:15.708 --> 1:59:17.292
Let us go.

1:59:17.458 --> 1:59:18.917
Let you go?

1:59:19.083 --> 1:59:19.792
Yeah.

1:59:19.917 --> 1:59:21.583
Are you fucking serious?

1:59:21.583 --> 1:59:22.625
Yes.

1:59:22.917 --> 1:59:24.917
We're in love.

1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:28.250
Ahhh

1:59:28.750 --> 1:59:30.750
Your in love.

1:59:33.917 --> 1:59:37.958
You pathetic pair of cunts, you don't know what love is.

1:59:40.958 --> 1:59:42.958
Dad!

1:59:53.667 --> 1:59:59.417
Dad, come on let's go, come on, let's go quick come on.

2:00:03.083 --> 2:00:07.000
I'm sorry did I interrupt you little love bird adventure.

2:00:07.625 --> 2:00:08.667
Dad.

2:00:09.292 --> 2:00:11.292
I think he's gone now love, don't you?

2:00:12.458 --> 2:00:13.500
Why?

2:00:13.583 --> 2:00:21.667
Why? Because you cheated, you try to get away,
well I'm in charge and always have been.

2:00:22.458 --> 2:00:24.458
I will always love you.

2:00:29.333 --> 2:00:31.333
So what happens now?

2:00:35.167 --> 2:00:37.167
You don't need to worry.

2:00:37.708 --> 2:00:39.708
(Screams)

2:00:40.417 --> 2:00:41.583
Fuck.

2:01:39.417 --> 2:01:40.750
(Phone rings)

2:01:45.667 --> 2:01:49.125
Hello? Yes this is he.

2:01:50.167 --> 2:01:52.167
Can we talk about it over the phone.

2:01:52.917 --> 2:01:54.917
Okay, where?

2:01:55.708 --> 2:01:57.375
Give me thirty minutes.

2:02:03.958 --> 2:02:04.958
Maurice?

2:02:04.958 --> 2:02:05.917
Yes.

2:02:06.125 --> 2:02:07.500
I'm Kevin.

2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:09.417
It's cold out there, where's your car?

2:02:09.417 --> 2:02:10.458
I walked.

2:02:10.458 --> 2:02:11.542
Where are you going from here?

2:02:11.750 --> 2:02:12.750
Back into town.

2:02:12.750 --> 2:02:14.750
It's cold, get in.

2:02:25.542 --> 2:02:27.000
What's this?

2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000
Take a look.

2:02:38.667 --> 2:02:42.833
It's bad isn't it? It's even worst because you know how old she was.

2:02:44.250 --> 2:02:45.458
You dirty little bastard.

2:02:45.750 --> 2:02:48.792
Now, now Maruice I only wanted to be your friend.

2:02:49.667 --> 2:02:50.708
What do you want?

2:02:50.792 --> 2:02:52.792
Five, should do it.

2:02:52.958 --> 2:02:54.708
Five? Five what?

2:02:54.750 --> 2:02:56.375
Thousand.

2:02:57.333 --> 2:02:59.333
And if I dont pay?

2:02:59.542 --> 2:03:01.542
The images will go to the police.

2:03:02.083 --> 2:03:04.500
My story, my paper.

2:03:07.292 --> 2:03:12.625
I thought, with all these characters out of the way,
I might just see this world in a different way.

2:03:14.542 --> 2:03:16.417
She's still out there.

2:03:16.417 --> 2:03:20.458
I'm going to her next and I bet that will be a good pay off.

2:03:21.708 --> 2:03:24.375
On that side, I can at least be happy, I suppose.

2:03:25.833 --> 2:03:28.792
So then, what we going to do about this?

2:03:41.250 --> 2:03:43.250
When did you realise whre the story was going?

2:03:43.958 --> 2:03:46.458
About a day before the teacher was killed by jodie.

2:03:47.167 --> 2:03:49.167
And you decided to just sit on it.

2:03:49.292 --> 2:03:53.250
She needed protection, she trusted me.
You should never trust the press.

2:03:53.625 --> 2:03:54.375
You're disgusting.

2:03:54.708 --> 2:03:59.208
That's what the teacher said right before
he was killed, she had such an agenda.

2:03:59.958 --> 2:04:01.958
I've obviously lived a very sheltered life.

2:04:06.208 --> 2:04:09.000
So, cash or the cops?

2:04:10.750 --> 2:04:11.583
Niether.

2:04:11.875 --> 2:04:12.667
What?

2:04:14.542 --> 2:04:16.292
Maurice, what are you doing?

2:04:17.208 --> 2:04:18.833
I don't want to live in this world anymore.

2:04:18.833 --> 2:04:20.708
Maurice, slow the fucking car down.

2:04:20.708 --> 2:04:22.833
I don't want to be a detective, I want do a new job.

2:04:23.125 --> 2:04:23.958
What you gonna do.

2:04:24.125 --> 2:04:26.125
Fucking pest control.

2:04:26.458 --> 2:04:28.125
We're going to go into a fucking wall.

2:04:28.333 --> 2:04:30.333
(Car crashes)

2:04:43.167 --> 2:04:45.833
Come on boys, daddy's got to go to work.

2:04:53.750 --> 2:04:55.417
Do you want pizza Rory.

2:04:55.542 --> 2:04:56.833
Yes please Sally.

2:04:57.083 --> 2:04:59.083
Come on guys, home time.

2:05:21.792 --> 2:05:22.583
Sally.

2:05:22.583 --> 2:05:23.583
Yes.

2:05:23.750 --> 2:05:25.750
I wish you were my mummy.

2:05:29.667 --> 2:05:34.917
Well, I'd like that, and maybe I can be, what do you think?

2:05:35.458 --> 2:05:36.458
Yeah.

2:05:40.542 --> 2:05:42.542
(Door bell rings)

2:05:43.792 --> 2:05:45.208
Excuse me.

2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:03.000
Hello Rory, I'm Colin.

2:06:03.333 --> 2:06:05.208
Hello Colin.

2:06:06.917 --> 2:06:10.583
Your mum tells me you like tractors, and you've got hundreds of them.

2:06:10.708 --> 2:06:13.000
Yes, and I have a massive one upstairs.

2:06:13.458 --> 2:06:15.708
Really, why don't you show it to me then?
