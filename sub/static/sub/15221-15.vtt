just waitin' to get you.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.732
<i>[ Congregation ] Amen.! Amen.!</i>
Guess he got you,
forgot to let go.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.710
<i>Sister Rose</i>
<i>will now lead the choir</i>-
What?

14:39.778 --> 14:42.246
in a soul-stirring hymn-
What did you say?

14:42.314 --> 14:46.444
What do you mean? He forgot?
He forgot to let go of what?

14:46.518 --> 14:50.978
-<i>* [ Piano ]</i>
-* [ Singing Hymn ]

14:51.056 --> 14:53.149
Al, I think I figured out
why I'm here.

14:53.225 --> 14:57.525
Well, Ziggy says there's
a 90% chance you're here
to keep Lynell out of show business.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.530
Wrong.
Wrong?

14:59.598 --> 15:03.432
Wrong. I think I'm here
to make sure that her father
supports her.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.369
And if I can do that,
that'll keep their relationship intact.

15:06.438 --> 15:10.374
No, no, no. Ziggy- No, no.
Ziggy has been known
to be wrong.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.405
Well, we have to trust
Ziggy's statistics over yours.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.782
Why?
Why? Well, we-
Ziggy keeps better records.

15:19.852 --> 15:23.618
Besides, Ziggy says
day after tomorrow,

15:23.689 --> 15:26.317
you're gonna sing
in some local contest.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.792
The winner gets a hundred bucks
and a tryout at the Regal Theater.

15:28.861 --> 15:32.422
- <i>Regal Theater?</i>
- Yeah. It's Chicago's version of the Apollo.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.464
Except Lynell doesn't sing, right?

15:36.535 --> 15:39.470
<i>Well,yeah, she sings.</i>
<i>She lies to her father,</i>

15:39.538 --> 15:42.063
and he traces her to the club,

15:42.141 --> 15:45.304
and then he pulls her off the stage
right in the middle of the show.

15:45.377 --> 15:48.107
And a big fight breaks out.
Terrible.
And Lynell never forgives him.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.705
Bingo.
[ Sighs ]
Then I'm right.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.719
I'm here to help Reverend Walters
support his daughter,

15:54.787 --> 15:57.654
to-to-to accept her
and to understand her.

15:57.723 --> 16:02.183
So how are you gonna do that?
Eh- Uh, uh-

16:02.261 --> 16:05.958
Well, I don't know. I mean,
you know, maybe if he heard
how good they were-

16:06.031 --> 16:07.965
No, no, no, no.
Then I'd have to sing.

16:08.033 --> 16:11.400
So?
So first of all, I don't know
any of the songs or the routines.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.768
And secondly, I'm a man.
I'm not a 1 6-year-old girl.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.773
That never stopped you before.

16:15.841 --> 16:18.742
Besides, they're gonna be hearing
and seeing Cherea.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.905
What does Ziggy say
our chances are?
Well the odds are 50-50.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.246
But I can up the odds with
the right music and a few choice steps.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.376
Yeah, well, I don't know
a few choice steps.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.082
Well, I do.
I'll teach you some moves.
You'll teach me some moves?

16:31.156 --> 16:33.818
Hey, I was at the Regal Theater
in its heyday.

16:33.892 --> 16:37.293
I remember the Marvelettes, Smokey,

16:37.363 --> 16:42.164
Martha and the Vandellas,James Brown,
the hardest-working man in show business.

16:42.234 --> 16:45.635
All you have to do is keep your
harmonies tight and remember to say-

16:45.704 --> 16:49.037
* [ R&B ]

17:00.886 --> 17:04.287
* [ Continues ]
I don't get these steps.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.415
These moves made
the Temptations famous.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.358
They're just a little
ahead of their time,
that's all, these steps.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.362
They're out of time.

17:11.430 --> 17:15.298
Damn, Cherea, you're
movin' like a white girl.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.684
Okay. What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
* [ Continues ]

17:41.760 --> 17:44.752

Put 'em like that.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.184
Yes! Yes.
We did it.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.193
Yes.
All right.
Now, don't get too happy.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.889
All right.
Don't get too happy.
You still need a lot of work.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.898
We still need a lot of work.
We'll be terrific.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.161
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, but we're doin'
the wrong song.

18:23.235 --> 18:26.932
What?
This was a number one hit.
That's just it. It <i>was.</i>

18:27.005 --> 18:29.940
We need somethin'-
somethin' hot.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.442
- Something with
a little more fire, you mean?
- What?

18:32.511 --> 18:33.808
"Mickey's Monkey.''
Uh, " Mickey's Monkey.''

18:33.879 --> 18:35.244
No, no, no.
What?

18:35.314 --> 18:38.249
No, no. Forget that. Forget it.
No, that wouldn't have been good.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.410
How about
"Can I Get A Witness''?
No, that wasn't out yet.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.579
What? What? What?
What's he talkin' about?
No, no. Forget it.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.623
- What? What? What?
- <i>What about "Heat Wave''</i>

18:45.691 --> 18:48.057
By Martha and the Vandellas.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.561
I just so happen to have
a pre-release on it.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.655
So who's this <i>giabbone?</i>
How'd you get in the house, Mr. Lee?

18:53.732 --> 18:57.998
I told you to call me Bobby.
My father will get upset
if he finds you here, Bobby.

18:58.070 --> 19:02.700
Oh, he'll get more than upset, honey.
We're talkin' murder in the first degree.

19:02.774 --> 19:06.710
Well, that's because a young lady
would never entertain a gentleman
up in her bedroom.

19:06.778 --> 19:10.407
Well, since we all understand that,
why don't you go downstairs?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.416
It's not my fault.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.816
I was just walkin' down the street,
mindin' my business,

19:14.887 --> 19:19.085
and I heard that sweet, sensual voice
of yours ridin' on a cool breeze.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.490
It made me come
and knock on the door.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.223
When nobody answered, I just-
Well, I just knocked a little harder,
and it came open.

19:25.297 --> 19:29.666
Watch out for this guy, Sam. He's slicker
than spit on a patent leather shoe.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.636
- You shouldn't be here.
- All right, maybe not.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.867
But Lynell knows I mean
no disrespect.
Trust me, Sam.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.842
This guy is a snake.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.880
I'm sure you don't,
so why don't you just leave.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.815
All right.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.181
But I meant what I said
about this song.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.914
You guys sing this tomorrow night,
you're a cinch for first place...

19:49.988 --> 19:52.081
and a shot at the Regal.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.921
Especially with a voice
as beautiful as Lynell's.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.723
We don't have charts for the band or-
Can you learn the song?

19:57.796 --> 20:00.924
Well, yeah.
All right, well, I'll get Rainey
to do up the charts.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.524
- He knows your key.
- Why?

20:03.602 --> 20:08.266
Let's just say I, uh-
I believe in young talent.

20:10.609 --> 20:15.239
Plus if you girls win,
you sign an exclusive deal with me,
and I'll take you straight to the top.

20:15.314 --> 20:18.078
More like the bottom.
Get this, Sam. Robert Z. Lee,

20:18.150 --> 20:21.745
small-time businessman,
part-time... pimp.

20:21.820 --> 20:25.654
- Well, what do you say?
- He's the owner of Bobby's Blues Club,

20:25.724 --> 20:29.251
and he ends up doing 20 years
in the big house for statutory rape.

20:29.328 --> 20:33.492
- Lynell?
- I don't know if we can
get it together that fast.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.261
No data.
All right, Mr. Lee,
I'll tell you what.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.633
Lynell, Paula and I,
we're gonna talk about this.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.605
We're gonna listen to your song.
We'll let you know our intentions.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.471
That's a hellfire grip
you got there, darling.
You don't know the half of it.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.602
Daddy!
What are you doin' in my house?

20:46.678 --> 20:50.409
- He came by to bring us a new record.
- <i>That's the God's honest truth,</i>
<i>Reverend Walters.</i>

20:50.482 --> 20:53.280
It's so new, it hasn't even
been played on the radio yet.

20:53.352 --> 20:56.788
Well, somebody better tell me
why this sinner has to deliver records
to my daughter's bedroom!

20:56.855 --> 20:59.289
- Daddy!
- I asked a question.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.293
Look, man,just because
I don't attend your church
doesn't make me a sinner.

21:02.361 --> 21:06.127
Even though you don't attend
any church doesn't make you a sinner.

21:06.198 --> 21:10.658
But what you said to Leda Brown's
1 3-year-old daughter
does make you a sinner!

21:10.736 --> 21:14.194
Well, that's just her word
against mine, ain't it?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.764
Now, if you don't mind-
<i>[ Ziggy Beeping ]</i>

21:16.842 --> 21:19.936
<i>I've got nothin', Sam.</i>
<i>Either they never brought charges,</i>
<i>or they were dropped.</i>

21:20.012 --> 21:22.981
- Your word is about as good
as the devil's in this house.
-Just stop it!

21:23.048 --> 21:28.486
<i>Mr. Lee came over to try to be nice</i>
<i>to me, not to commit a crime.!</i>

21:28.553 --> 21:30.487
Lynell, this man will-

21:30.555 --> 21:32.819
Lynell, this man will hurt you.
Don't you know that?

21:32.891 --> 21:35.724
Does that privilege
only belong to you, Daddy?
How dare you!

21:35.794 --> 21:40.163
- <i>[ Lynell Screams ]</i>
- <i>Now, don't you defy me. You hear me?</i>

21:40.232 --> 21:42.166
Now, you go to your room.
No!

21:42.234 --> 21:44.168
I said go to your room!

21:44.236 --> 21:47.330
And you-You stay
away from my daughter.

21:47.406 --> 21:51.843
Or as God is my judge,
I will come down to that... brothel,

21:51.910 --> 21:55.243
and I will rip it down
with my bare hands.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.181
Let me tell you something.
You step one foot in my club,

21:58.250 --> 22:00.377
and God himself won't be able
to keep me off of you.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.920
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Sam, do something.!</i>
<i>This could be the start of it.</i>

22:02.988 --> 22:05.513

I need you to leave now.
[ Muttering ]

22:05.590 --> 22:07.854
Please. Please.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.888
Daddy, don't do this.
Lynell, this is for your own good.

22:14.966 --> 22:19.164
All right? Now,just close the door
and go to your room.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.802
- [ Sighs ]
- Lynell. Lynell, wait just a second.

22:25.877 --> 22:28.277
He's my chance to get outta here!
There's got to be another way.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.406
What?
I- I don't know.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.815
Then let me go talk to him!
No,just give me a chance
to figure out another way.

22:33.885 --> 22:37.582
[ Sighs ]
Oh, God.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.056
You better think of something.
Yeah, well, I have.

22:44.129 --> 22:47.496
I want you to get me the name
of all the local record companies, okay?

22:47.566 --> 22:52.503
I'll call every one of them
until I can find somebody who
will come and hear the Dovettes.

22:52.571 --> 22:57.270
Maybe I can convince Lynell
there's somebody out there
better than Bobby Lee.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.276
Okay.

23:14.659 --> 23:18.493
What are you doing?
Lookin' at my feet.

23:22.834 --> 23:24.768
Those are nice feet.

23:24.836 --> 23:29.671
Yep. And they're nailed down
right here at 47 th and Ellis.

23:29.741 --> 23:33.700
Nailed down
tighter than a pine coffin.

23:33.779 --> 23:36.407
And I'm runnin' out of air, Cherea.

23:36.481 --> 23:39.473
Oh, come on now.
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.247
That's what Mama used to say.

23:43.488 --> 23:47.686
She said, " You'll make it
just fine, Lynell.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.693
Just fine.''

23:49.761 --> 23:51.991
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>I'm sure she meant it too.</i>

23:52.063 --> 23:54.588
She meant it until the day
she decided to die.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.126
People don't decide to die.

23:58.203 --> 24:00.671
Mama did.

24:00.739 --> 24:03.207
And you know what?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.438
I think she was happy.
Happy to be free.

24:06.511 --> 24:09.446
How could she be happy, Lynell?

24:09.514 --> 24:11.812
She had to leave behind
a daughter that she loved.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.351
She hated him more.

24:14.419 --> 24:17.013
She tried to leave him once.

24:19.691 --> 24:22.057
She took me, and-

24:23.462 --> 24:25.623
and she tried to run away.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.965
But he brought us back.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.970
You know why?

24:33.038 --> 24:35.131
Because he loved you?

24:35.207 --> 24:40.406
Because he was afraid
about what people would say
about the righteous reverend...

24:40.479 --> 24:43.346
if his wife ran off and left him.

24:44.950 --> 24:48.613
It didn't matter that she was unhappy,

24:48.687 --> 24:51.588
that she had no life of her own.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.648
The only thing that mattered...

24:54.726 --> 24:57.490
was what other people thought.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.524
That's when she decided to die.

25:05.136 --> 25:09.038
And so will I if we don't sing
in this contest tomorrow night.

25:09.107 --> 25:12.838
Now, wait just a second.
Singing in a contest
isn't gonna save your life.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.607
Yeah, but Bobby said-
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Forget about Bobby Lee.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.080
Forget him.
Forget about his contract.

25:18.149 --> 25:21.346
Today I talked to the head
of Decca Records.

25:21.419 --> 25:24.388
He said that he would come
and hear us sing.
When?

25:24.456 --> 25:27.857
Well, as soon as I can find us a club.
Well, he can hear us sing
at Bobby's club!

25:27.926 --> 25:30.417
No, no, no, not Bobby's.
Not Bobby's.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.554
Come on!
We don't have a choice!

25:36.868 --> 25:39.666
All right. All right.
We'll sing in the club.
All right!

25:39.738 --> 25:43.333
Now, wait a second now.
You gotta promise me-
no contract with Bobby Lee.

25:43.408 --> 25:46.002
What?
And you have to finish
high school.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.136
Oh, come on, Cherea.
Now, Lynell, Lynell, please.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.478
You gotta trust me on this.
You gotta meet your father halfway.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.246
You finish high school,
and I bet that he will let you sing.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.253
I can't change him, Cherea.

25:56.321 --> 25:58.881
Well, I think that's
what I'm here for.

25:58.957 --> 26:01.187
What are you gonna do?

26:02.360 --> 26:05.193
Well, I think, um,

26:05.263 --> 26:07.629
we should invite him
to hear us sing.

26:07.699 --> 26:10.133
Oh, are you crazy?
It's the only way.

26:10.201 --> 26:13.534
Once he hears you sing,
he will accept your career.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.836
And if you could accept his love-
I don't know.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.399
It's the only way.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.502
All right.
All right.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.482
But if this doesn't work,
we're gonna have to sign with Bobby.
<i>It doesn't work.</i>

26:25.550 --> 26:29.179
She signs with Bobby,
and she has a miserable life.

26:29.254 --> 26:33.588
Well, I can't change history...
until I talk to her father, right?

26:33.658 --> 26:37.116
Well, when do you plan
on doing that?
Tomorrow night before the show.

26:37.195 --> 26:41.063
But we need some new choreography,
some new steps for that new song we got.

26:41.132 --> 26:43.430
You gotta come up
with something for us.
Okay, okay, okay.

26:43.501 --> 26:47.369

about the sleaze with the perfect teeth?
What he doesn't know doesn't matter.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.068

Lynell out of his clutches, right?

26:51.142 --> 26:54.305
Ziggy says this whole thing
is gonna be a catastrophe.

26:54.379 --> 26:57.940
Ziggy should have a little
more faith in human nature.

27:00.085 --> 27:02.383

If there's a big applause from the crowd,
have 'em jump right back in.

back in here at the bridge, all right?
Okay. Smokin'!

Don't do it. Don't-
Look, we don't need this guy, okay?

Then get outta here.
But if you wanna sing here tonight,

30:26.691 --> 30:29.319
you'll be back here with an apology,
or you can forget it.

- Look, we gotta apologize.
- Are you crazy?

To do what? To come see us
perform in my bedroom?

Now, either you apologize with me,
or I'm goin' on by myself.

and she ends up alone.

she ends up completely alone.

to say to Lynell.

so much anger inside of her.

I used to think she was mad at you
for dyin' and mad at me
for lettin' you die.

But Lynell is-
Mad at herself, Reverend.

31:53.845 --> 31:59.147
[ Sighs ]
I should have never, ever let Lynell
take care of her mother.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.845
She was too young
to see that kind of pain.

32:04.289 --> 32:07.520

what he thinks we can handle.

and now I've lost her.

No, you haven't. No.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.929
Not yet anyway.

If I try to hold on to her,
she'll just run away from me.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.509
Like your wife did?

32:26.577 --> 32:29.740
Sylvia was sick for a long time.

32:29.814 --> 32:33.716
I mean, she-
she stopped seeing her friends.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.118
She locked herself away from everybody.

32:37.188 --> 32:42.683
And when she found out she was dying,
she tried to run away from me.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.455
But Lynell said that you stopped them.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.463
Them?
Yeah.

32:46.531 --> 32:49.125
She didn't take Lynell with her.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.966
But Lynell said-
That's what Lynell
needed to believe.

32:53.037 --> 32:56.165
When her mother left,
she cried for weeks.

32:57.875 --> 33:02.744
Ifinally found her in a hotel,

33:02.814 --> 33:05.783
and I brought her back home.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.217
Lynell never left her side.

33:09.287 --> 33:11.312
Not until they came
and took her away.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.226
She had a right to be angry,

33:17.295 --> 33:19.889
because I left them there
to face death...

33:19.964 --> 33:22.262
while I came and hid in my church.

33:25.269 --> 33:27.203

33:30.308 --> 33:34.608
And now...
I've lost my little girl too.

33:38.616 --> 33:42.848
Not if you stand by her.
You tell her you want her to sing tonight,

33:42.920 --> 33:45.184
that you want to be there to hear her.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.389
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

33:51.462 --> 33:54.761

so she can become somebody.

You've gotta trust her to find
her own reasons to finish school.
Let her make her own choices.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.567
Well, she's 1 5 years old. She has
plenty of time to make her own choices.

I know that, but-
Right now...

34:03.941 --> 34:07.240

and apologize to that slime bucket.

Yeah, but she goes on alone.
