00:16.499 --> 00:18.933
It's been, like,
three, four months now.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.399
Can I get you some coffee?

00:22.172 --> 00:24.333
Roast beef sandwich on a roll.

00:24.541 --> 00:26.031
Meat, raw as possible.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.437
Room-temperature water.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.102
- No ice.
- Gotcha.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.340
- Do you have jalapenos?
- I think he does.

00:33.550 --> 00:36.485
Eleven of those, please. On the side.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.256
Eleven. You got it.

01:22.899 --> 01:23.991
What is that?

01:25.802 --> 01:28.168
That language. Is that, like,
Korean or something?

01:28.338 --> 01:32.172
- No.
- Good.

01:32.342 --> 01:36.108
I had Asian Studies at CUNY.
Thought I really missed something.

02:51.955 --> 02:54.253
You, get out of there!

03:01.431 --> 03:03.661
Move, move!

03:24.754 --> 03:26.051
Hurry up.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.827
It has arrived.

04:15.071 --> 04:20.031
And add 150 grams of sucrose.

04:20.209 --> 04:23.406
Maintain at 70 degrees Fahrenheit...

04:23.579 --> 04:27.709
...for 120 hours.

04:27.884 --> 04:32.480
- Thirty milliliters at 80 degrees...
- What formula are you rattling off...

04:32.655 --> 04:34.782
...at 3:00 in the morning?

04:37.026 --> 04:39.494
Formula for root beer.

04:39.662 --> 04:41.493
Root beer?

04:41.731 --> 04:45.189
That's what's so important you couldn't
stop yourself from broadcasting?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.336
I haven't had it for ages.

04:47.503 --> 04:50.904
I... I thought I might make some
in the lab tomorrow.

04:55.178 --> 04:56.338
Where are you going?

04:56.512 --> 04:59.538
It occurs to me it might be easier
to sleep in the tub.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.684
A root-beer float.

05:01.851 --> 05:03.546
Delicious.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.951
Next time,
would you please drain the tub?

05:07.123 --> 05:08.317
Oh.

05:08.491 --> 05:11.289
Yes, indeed.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.802
- I know how to get there.
- Slow down.

05:22.005 --> 05:24.473
Her office is right up here.
I've been there before.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.767
Sir, you don't have clearance
to walk unescorted.

05:26.943 --> 05:28.774
- Peter.
- We need to talk.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.744
Is that okay?
Do I have clearance to talk to her?

05:31.914 --> 05:33.040
It's okay. I got it.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.282
Come with me.

05:36.819 --> 05:39.083
- Where is your father?
- Walter is at the hotel.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.950
But your agents are standing guard.

05:41.124 --> 05:43.217
Not that it matters,
the man is unconscious.

05:43.393 --> 05:47.921
He was awake till 5 reciting the chemical
compositions of his favorite beverages...

05:48.097 --> 05:50.588
...after he finished lecturing
on how I squandered...

05:50.767 --> 05:53.099
...my above-average intellect
and my substantial education.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.669
All while
he was standing there naked...

05:55.838 --> 05:58.238
...because he prefers the breeze.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.972
Your living arrangements are temporary.
We're finding you an apartment.

06:02.145 --> 06:03.169
Olivia, don't bother.

06:03.346 --> 06:06.645
I wanted to help. I felt bad. I still feel bad
about what happened to you.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.477
But the truth is, you don't need me here.

06:08.651 --> 06:11.142
- That isn't the truth.
- It is. Things are happening here.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.947
Strange things that need investigating...

06:13.122 --> 06:16.649
...that connect to the insane work
Walter was doing way back when.

06:16.826 --> 06:20.159
But he's the one with the answers.
You need him. I'm just a babysitter.

06:20.329 --> 06:24.197
Peter, you decipher what he says,
things other people can't even follow.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.459
No, not anymore.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.263
Anybody can do that.
There's nothing special about me.

06:29.439 --> 06:31.464
You're his son.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.440
That's not the only thing.

06:39.615 --> 06:42.175
I don't do well staying in one place,
you know that.

06:45.721 --> 06:47.018
This isn't the job for me.

06:47.190 --> 06:49.454
- If you leave, so does he.
- Really?

06:49.625 --> 06:52.890
If the federal government wants to get
Walter out of a mental institution...

06:53.096 --> 06:56.293
...they can't without his son's consent?
- It's your father.

06:56.466 --> 06:57.694
He's made it very clear...

06:57.867 --> 07:00.700
...that if you leave, he won't cooperate
with our investigations.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.973
I don't believe it.

07:05.141 --> 07:08.167
He would rather go back to St Claire's
than work here without you.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.911
He's said that more than once.

07:11.914 --> 07:13.973
Was he wearing clothes at the time?

07:41.277 --> 07:43.507
Good morning. Hello.

07:43.679 --> 07:45.772
Hello. Morning.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.108
Morning.

07:47.283 --> 07:48.443
Morning.

07:48.651 --> 07:52.553
Yesterday there was an explosion
at a construction site in Brooklyn.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.212
A crane collapsed.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.950
Left three dead, two dozen injured.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.526
The public was told it was
a gas-main explosion...

07:59.695 --> 08:01.925
...which, technically, is the truth.

08:02.098 --> 08:05.067
It's what caused the explosion
I want you to see.

08:11.774 --> 08:14.572
We had it transported here
late last night.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.645
We've got NSA and CDC
gathering data.

08:17.813 --> 08:18.871
But, Dr. Bishop...

08:19.048 --> 08:22.108
...I wanted you to see this
as soon as possible.

08:29.058 --> 08:30.992
- What is it?
- It's why you're here.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.719
- We don't know.
- It just fell from the sky?

08:33.895 --> 08:35.488
It came from underground.

08:35.698 --> 08:38.565
Blasted through an unused
subway tunnel into a gas main.

08:38.734 --> 08:41.395
- Underground?
- Came to rest on the surface...

08:41.571 --> 08:43.163
...as if someone placed it there.

08:43.339 --> 08:45.500
- Solid iridium.
- We think so, yes.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.176
- Subsonic vibrations?
- At two megahertz, then at four.

08:48.344 --> 08:49.971
- This is vibrating?
- Dr. Bishop...

08:50.146 --> 08:52.137
...do you have an idea
what this may be?

08:52.315 --> 08:54.909
An idea, yes.

08:55.251 --> 08:56.684
Do you feel like sharing?

08:56.852 --> 08:58.945
No. It's too early.

08:59.222 --> 09:01.690
This isn't the first time
one of these has shown up.

09:01.857 --> 09:04.451
1987, at Quantico.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.118
Colonel Jacobson
was in charge of the investigation.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.299
- Henry Jacobson?
- I spoke to him myself this morning.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.933
He's expecting your visit.

09:12.101 --> 09:14.535
Said he's looking forward
to seeing you again.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.537
What do you wanna do?

09:21.744 --> 09:23.678
What kind of man
would take off on you...

09:23.846 --> 09:26.041
...the minute a can
of magic space soup appears out...

09:26.249 --> 09:28.183
- Who says it came from space?
- It's a joke.

09:28.351 --> 09:30.683
- Oh?
- Thank you for staying.

09:30.853 --> 09:33.378
This is the last one, Olivia...

09:33.556 --> 09:35.547
...and then I'm gone.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.320
Okay.

09:41.764 --> 09:43.391
We need to get this
back to the lab.

09:43.566 --> 09:45.966
We can't risk transferring this
to the university.

09:46.135 --> 09:48.467
- We'd rather...
- lf you require my perspicacity...

09:48.638 --> 09:52.074
...such as it exists, then there are
certain fundamental requirements...

09:52.275 --> 09:55.574
...not the least of which is access
to my equipment, my lab.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.688
Well, well, well.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.231
I was hoping I'd have an excuse
to see you again.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.929
It's good to see you.

10:23.606 --> 10:26.700
It's been more than a year
since she died. It's still difficult.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.710
I suppose it always will be.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.006
Jessica took care of the house.

10:32.181 --> 10:35.548
Hell, she, ha, ha.
She took care of everything.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.619
I apologize for what has to be
horrible coffee.

10:38.821 --> 10:40.914
No. It's delicious.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.356
I, uh...

10:45.528 --> 10:48.019
I know you lost someone too.

10:48.197 --> 10:51.360
My condolences.
It's not easy losing a partner.

10:51.534 --> 10:55.026
I know you and Agent Scott
were close.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.697
What can you tell me
about Quantico, 1987?

11:17.960 --> 11:20.793
Master Sergeant Stuart Malick.

11:20.963 --> 11:24.626
He was at his post at the Marine base
on the night of June 22nd.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.291
His job was to watch
the motion sensors.

11:27.470 --> 11:31.406
Perimeter security, to ensure that
there was no breach at the base.

11:31.574 --> 11:34.941
Except on that night,
the sensors went nuts.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.477
What he found was this.

11:39.415 --> 11:42.851
A metallic cylinder, 24 inches tall,
12 inches in diameter.

11:43.018 --> 11:46.784
He assumed it fell from the sky, that
perhaps it was a piece of a satellite...

11:46.956 --> 11:50.084
...except it wasn't. Stranger still...

11:50.259 --> 11:53.660
...although it seemed to be
a solid piece of hard metal...

11:53.829 --> 11:56.696
...it was vibrating.
- At two megahertz...

11:56.899 --> 11:58.332
...then again at four.

12:00.403 --> 12:01.529
There's another.

12:02.705 --> 12:07.267
- Where is this one? Still at Quantico?
- I was called in to investigate.

12:07.443 --> 12:09.604
We determined
it was transmitting something...

12:09.779 --> 12:11.940
...a signal that we couldn't decode.

12:12.114 --> 12:13.945
Forty-eight hours after we found it...

12:14.116 --> 12:17.882
...there was an explosion
unlike anything I'd ever seen.

12:18.053 --> 12:19.543
It went through the floor...

12:19.722 --> 12:22.054
...to the basement below.

12:22.224 --> 12:25.625
It exploded down.

12:26.462 --> 12:28.191
And was gone.

12:29.432 --> 12:31.525
I'll give you my files,
whatever you need.

12:32.134 --> 12:34.796
But this was a weird one, Olivia.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.631
And if it's happening again...

12:36.806 --> 12:42.574
...as a friend, I'd ask you to stay
as far away from this thing as you can.

12:53.722 --> 12:55.451
What exactly is this?

12:56.392 --> 12:58.758
In time, my dear.

13:40.102 --> 13:41.865
Hello, sir. Can I help you?

13:48.043 --> 13:50.841
Code red! Code red!
We have a breach in Sector 8.

14:09.632 --> 14:11.429
You.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.594
Where is it?

14:37.126 --> 14:39.026
Agent Dunham.

14:41.597 --> 14:43.394
Hello?

14:45.167 --> 14:46.361
Hello?

14:46.535 --> 14:47.832
Olivia?

14:50.906 --> 14:52.498
Hello?

14:53.509 --> 14:56.444
- Olivia.
- John?

15:03.052 --> 15:08.888
- Dispatch.
- This is Agent Dunham, 71862279.

15:09.058 --> 15:12.494
I need a call traced from my cell.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.128
It just came in.

15:14.296 --> 15:16.457
Please hold.

15:18.867 --> 15:22.633
We have no record of any calls
in the last three hours.

15:23.906 --> 15:26.875
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.811
Okay, thank you.

15:42.391 --> 15:46.487
The precision with which this object
was constructed is inspiring.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.323
Down to the molecular bonds.

15:48.497 --> 15:50.658
I hope that a gigantic
metallic suppository...

15:50.833 --> 15:52.960
...is not the pinnacle
of human achievement.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.030
What is it?

15:58.507 --> 15:59.735
Let me ask you a question.

15:59.908 --> 16:02.843
If I tried reverse psychology...
If I said to you right now:

16:03.012 --> 16:06.004
"Walter, don't tell me what that is,"
would that work?

16:06.749 --> 16:09.081
Many years ago,
I worked on Project Thor.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.252
Department of Defense
wanted a subterranean torpedo...

16:12.421 --> 16:16.016
...a missile which could, in theory,
be shot from anywhere in the world...

16:16.191 --> 16:19.558
...through the Earth's core
and hit its target on the other side.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.218
I know for a fact that is ridiculous.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.389
Open your mind, son,
or someone may open it for you.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.090
Even that doesn't make sense.

16:26.268 --> 16:28.429
The cylinder could be
any number of things...

16:28.604 --> 16:30.868
...none of which
I am prepared to discuss.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.737
Great. Well, I am glad
I stuck around for this.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.208
I don't believe it.

16:38.313 --> 16:39.940
What?

16:40.149 --> 16:41.241
Look.

16:41.717 --> 16:44.413
It's one of the photos
from Jacobson's file.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.315
Him. Remember?

16:46.555 --> 16:48.546
The bald guy.

16:48.724 --> 16:49.952
No. Who is he?

16:50.125 --> 16:53.390
- That's the point.
- You're starting to sound like Walter.

16:53.562 --> 16:55.826
There are many things
I'm not good at, too many.

16:56.031 --> 16:59.330
But one thing I can do,
that I've always been able to do...

16:59.535 --> 17:01.594
That game, Concentration...

17:02.104 --> 17:03.969
...memory, connecting things...

17:04.138 --> 17:05.470
...putting them together.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.001
See?

17:09.178 --> 17:11.669
Two weeks ago at the hospital.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.839
That's him.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.547
No way.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.490
...by early next week...

17:25.661 --> 17:28.185
...the chances are not good
of reaching a resolution.

17:32.101 --> 17:33.830
Can I help you?

17:38.273 --> 17:41.970
Still photograph from the crime scene
at Quantico, 1987.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.011
Look. He was there. Look at this.

17:45.514 --> 17:48.711
Less than two weeks ago at the
hospital in Quincy, the same guy.

17:48.884 --> 17:51.785
And he looks the same.
And he was there, with us.

17:54.289 --> 17:55.347
What?

17:56.792 --> 17:58.589
Come with me.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.958
Excuse us, please.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.700
It took us a year to spot him.

18:17.212 --> 18:18.679
You did it in three weeks.

18:27.256 --> 18:28.917
Who the hell is this guy?

18:29.892 --> 18:32.690
That is one excellent question.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.727
You've run him
through every database?

18:35.898 --> 18:38.332
- Of course.
- And there's nothing on him at all?

18:38.934 --> 18:40.162
No positive ID.

18:40.669 --> 18:43.103
We've recorded him
at over three dozen scenes...

18:43.272 --> 18:46.264
...all of which relate to the Pattern.
- How?

18:46.441 --> 18:49.569
- I mean, why? What is he doing?
- What it looks like he's doing...

18:49.745 --> 18:51.042
...is watching...

18:51.213 --> 18:52.680
...observing.

18:52.848 --> 18:55.078
Which is why we refer to him
as the Observer.

18:55.584 --> 18:58.075
But what he wants and
why he's there, we don't know.

18:58.253 --> 19:01.586
He was there the other day,
in New York at the construction site?

19:05.360 --> 19:06.520
This is Broyles.

19:10.532 --> 19:11.658
When did it happen?

19:13.702 --> 19:14.930
Okay. Turn it on.

19:20.876 --> 19:22.776
- What is that?
- Called "sound."

19:24.112 --> 19:25.807
I know that, thank you.
What's the point?

19:25.981 --> 19:28.472
I need to compare the numbers,
confirm my suspicions.

19:28.684 --> 19:30.709
Compare them to what?
Suspicions of what?

19:30.886 --> 19:32.751
- Astrid Farnsworth.
- I'll explain later.

19:32.921 --> 19:36.755
No, I want you to explain now. I wanna
know what the hell this tin can is.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.449
Peter?

19:38.627 --> 19:40.390
It's Olivia.

19:44.466 --> 19:46.297
- Hello.
- There's been an attack, Peter.

19:46.468 --> 19:48.129
The team at the warehouse is dead.

19:48.303 --> 19:50.498
- What? Who did it?
- I don't know.

19:50.706 --> 19:53.504
We're moving the thing
to a secure facility. I'm on my way.

19:53.709 --> 19:58.169
Got it. Whatever the hell that thing is,
you should have never brought it here.

19:58.347 --> 20:00.577
Why do you say this?

20:00.749 --> 20:02.944
- Someone come for it?
- Why would you ask that?

20:03.118 --> 20:04.642
- Have they?
- Yes.

20:07.155 --> 20:08.486
We need to keep this safe.

20:10.025 --> 20:12.425
I need something,
something very important.

20:12.594 --> 20:14.357
- What?
- Aluminum foil.

20:14.529 --> 20:16.019
- Why?
- Trust me.

20:16.231 --> 20:18.529
- No, thank you.
- Damn it!

20:18.734 --> 20:21.294
Must you always be such a smartass?

20:21.470 --> 20:26.874
I need the aluminum foil right now
to shield the frequencies of the cylinder.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.509
Your life depends on it.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.611
All our lives depend on it.

20:30.779 --> 20:32.246
Go now.

20:34.349 --> 20:36.374
I'm gonna go get you
your aluminum foil.

20:36.551 --> 20:39.987
When I get back, you're gonna tell me
what you think that thing does.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.747
While you're out...

20:42.491 --> 20:44.982
...if you see a chance
to get me a root-beer float...

20:45.160 --> 20:47.754
...that would be wonderful.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.799
I'll see what I can do.

20:53.268 --> 20:56.169
Would you be a lamb
and get me that syringe?

20:56.571 --> 20:58.004
Sure.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.541
Thank you.

21:21.730 --> 21:24.426
Hey, I got the tinfoil.

21:27.936 --> 21:28.994
Astrid.

21:29.171 --> 21:30.934
Astrid, hey.

21:31.139 --> 21:32.163
Astrid.

21:32.341 --> 21:34.901
Astrid, you okay? Astrid, look at me.

21:35.077 --> 21:37.238
Astrid. Hey, focus.
Focus for a second.

21:37.412 --> 21:39.972
Where is Walter?

21:52.527 --> 21:54.688
Someone came to you.

21:54.863 --> 21:55.989
Think about her.

22:00.102 --> 22:01.865
I know you were there.

22:02.037 --> 22:04.062
The last time.

22:04.973 --> 22:06.406
And she's come to you now.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.907
Think about that woman.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.440
Don't play with me.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.559
Now, you tell me now
or I'll do that again.

22:25.327 --> 22:27.318
Think.

22:32.734 --> 22:34.326
See?

22:34.503 --> 22:35.595
That was easy.

22:50.986 --> 22:52.419
Bless you.

23:02.864 --> 23:07.358
I haven't had a root-beer float
in 17 years.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.732
And how is it?

23:14.342 --> 23:16.173
Heavenly.

23:16.978 --> 23:19.037
And earthly at the same time.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.846
Quite the connoisseur.

23:23.385 --> 23:24.613
Do you want some?

23:25.253 --> 23:26.845
No, thank you.

23:27.022 --> 23:28.649
I wouldn't taste much anyway.

23:33.361 --> 23:35.522
Seventeen years.

23:35.697 --> 23:38.359
That's a long time
to go without something you love.

23:38.533 --> 23:41.627
Where I've been,
you lose track of time.

23:42.137 --> 23:44.367
So much now to make up for.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.472
Thank you for hiding the beacon.

23:48.643 --> 23:51.168
I can't touch it myself.

23:51.713 --> 23:55.809
I know you have questions.
Soon you will have answers.

23:57.719 --> 23:58.777
Of course.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.852
Dr. Walter Bishop,
we're forwarding his photo.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.427
- I want surveillance outside his residence.
- Come on, this is getting...

24:08.597 --> 24:11.532
- Do not tell me you have no idea...
- You're assuming I have...

24:11.700 --> 24:13.691
...any understanding
of that man's brain.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.269
You gave us the impression
you could handle it.

24:16.438 --> 24:19.271
I didn't promise you anything.
I warned you from the word "go."

24:22.410 --> 24:24.207
Agent Dunham.

24:24.613 --> 24:25.807
Thank God. Where?

24:26.948 --> 24:28.506
We'll be right there.

24:28.683 --> 24:31.948
Walter just got picked up,
walking the median of I-95.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.390
Thank you.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.435
If it's possible, I would very much like
my own clothes back.

24:53.608 --> 24:55.769
Let me explain
how this works to you, Walter.

24:55.944 --> 24:59.778
You can't inject a federal officer with
sedatives, steal government property...

24:59.948 --> 25:03.611
...escape from custody, and then ask
to be not treated like a criminal.

25:03.785 --> 25:07.653
Have you never taken anything because
you knew it was the right thing to do?

25:07.856 --> 25:09.551
This isn't about me.

25:09.724 --> 25:11.419
Maybe it is, Peter.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.428
You took the cylinder.
Do you remember that?

25:15.096 --> 25:17.963
Yes, of course.
What would you like to know about it?

25:18.133 --> 25:20.567
- Where is it?
- I can't tell you that.

25:20.869 --> 25:23.963
But I can tell you that someone
is coming to seek the cylinder...

25:24.139 --> 25:26.937
...thus I had to hide it.

25:27.375 --> 25:30.173
And I don't recall
where or from whom.

25:30.812 --> 25:32.245
We need you to remember.

25:32.414 --> 25:36.441
It may be dangerous
and we need to help keep people safe.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.642
Tell me what it is.

25:37.819 --> 25:41.653
If I attempted to explain it to you,
you might think me mad.

25:41.823 --> 25:44.155
Don't worry,
there's no chance of that happening.

25:44.326 --> 25:48.626
I believe there are only
another four hours...

25:48.797 --> 25:52.756
...in which I must keep the cylinder
from those who are trying to get it.

25:52.934 --> 25:55.869
A theory I have discussed with
my friend, who agrees with me.

25:56.037 --> 25:58.801
Your friend.
Um, he's a tall fellow, right?

25:58.974 --> 26:02.273
- Pink, big fuzzy ears?
- No, he's a man.

26:02.444 --> 26:06.346
Quite nice, albeit extremely bald.

26:07.115 --> 26:08.980
No eyebrows either.

26:09.150 --> 26:12.711
Ha, ha. It's disturbing,
but you get accustomed to it.

26:15.523 --> 26:16.615
You talked to him?

26:16.791 --> 26:19.351
You think it's a good idea
to feed into his delusions?

26:19.527 --> 26:21.791
Walter, who is he?
Where can we find him?

26:21.963 --> 26:25.023
- You won't be able to find him...
- He's in the seventh dimension.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.929
He's shy.

26:27.469 --> 26:31.200
Though he wouldn't be any
use to you. He just observes.

26:31.373 --> 26:35.070
You haven't talked to this man. You've
seen him in Olivia's photographs...

26:35.243 --> 26:38.235
...so cut out the gibberish
and tell us where the cylinder is.

26:38.446 --> 26:43.383
Must you always be so small-minded?

26:44.986 --> 26:47.750
Damn it, don't be like her,
like your mother.

26:48.323 --> 26:54.694
Questioning my judgment.
I am not a child. I will not be babied.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.676
Thank you for that.

27:10.612 --> 27:12.910
That's exactly what I needed.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.238
Guilt relieved.

27:14.916 --> 27:16.611
Olivia, I am very sorry...

27:16.785 --> 27:21.051
...but I think you'll understand why
I don't wanna hang around any longer.

27:27.228 --> 27:29.355
I upset him, didn't I?

27:46.448 --> 27:48.313
- Where are we?
- I couldn't tell you.

27:48.516 --> 27:51.280
Walter's hiding something.
He's being as cryptic as ever.

27:51.453 --> 27:55.253
He says he had to keep the cylinder safe,
that someone is looking for it.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.414
Welcome to the joys of Walter Bishop.

27:58.526 --> 27:59.823
Where did he take it?

28:00.028 --> 28:02.292
You'll have to ask Walter,
he won't tell me.

28:02.464 --> 28:04.625
But apparently
he had a meeting with a man...

28:04.799 --> 28:08.326
...matching the description
of our friend, the bald guy.

28:08.570 --> 28:10.629
Well, I know a lot of bald guys.

28:11.139 --> 28:12.970
The Observer.

28:13.241 --> 28:15.402
Are you saying that
Walter said he knows him?

28:15.577 --> 28:20.241
I'm saying he's not cooperating.
I'm saying I'm confused.

28:35.330 --> 28:38.697
Hey, man.
Thanks for calling me back so fast.

28:39.134 --> 28:42.069
Look, don't start with me
right now, okay?

28:42.303 --> 28:46.171
Well, guess what, I'm calling this time
to ask for a favor too.

28:48.076 --> 28:50.135
No, I need some work.

28:51.679 --> 28:55.513
Well, I don't really care, as long as it
puts some money in my pocket.

28:57.719 --> 29:00.187
Anywhere but Boston.

29:03.358 --> 29:04.848
Okay.

29:21.376 --> 29:22.843
Agent Dunham?

29:23.011 --> 29:25.445
Agent Farnsworth is on the phone.

29:27.549 --> 29:29.847
I don't know, about an hour ago.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.350
When he left,
he was pretty upset with Walter.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.579
Maybe he just finally left.

29:34.756 --> 29:36.883
No, there was a struggle here.

29:37.058 --> 29:38.855
I'll check it out. Thanks, Astrid.

29:42.764 --> 29:45.858
Call Harvard campus security.
There's a closed-circuit camera...

29:46.034 --> 29:48.730
...outside Countway Library
aimed at the Kresge Building.

29:48.903 --> 29:51.736
I need footage going back two hours.

29:57.612 --> 29:59.876
You don't work for Big Eddie, do you?

30:00.048 --> 30:01.913
Look, I think you got the wrong guy.

30:05.420 --> 30:06.512
What I'm saying is...

30:08.022 --> 30:11.753
...whatever it is you want, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to give it to you.

30:20.134 --> 30:22.125
No. No. Aah!

30:22.303 --> 30:23.497
No.

30:42.056 --> 30:43.717
You have something I need.

30:43.892 --> 30:46.952
- Tell me where it is.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

30:47.128 --> 30:50.154
I'm going to ask you some questions.
Please answer honestly.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.068
What's the most pain
you've ever felt in your life?

30:59.274 --> 31:01.105
This was taken outside your lab.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.302
Have you ever seen this man before?

31:04.479 --> 31:05.969
I don't believe so, no.

31:06.147 --> 31:09.173
Something's happened, yes?
Something unfortunate. What is it?

31:09.350 --> 31:12.251
I believe this man
may have abducted Peter.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.813
That's not... No.

31:16.057 --> 31:18.651
- Peter will lead him to it.
- To what, the cylinder?

31:18.826 --> 31:20.987
- Yes.
- How? Did you tell him where you put it?

31:21.162 --> 31:23.460
No, of course not.

31:23.698 --> 31:25.063
I don't need to.

31:27.769 --> 31:30.761
You and your colleagues had
the cylinder last. Where is it now?

31:30.939 --> 31:32.497
I have no idea.

31:32.674 --> 31:37.236
And even if I did,
you're the last person I would tell.

31:41.349 --> 31:43.044
But you just did tell me.

31:43.217 --> 31:45.617
Your father hid it,
but you don't know where.

31:47.655 --> 31:51.489
And yes, to answer your question,
when this is over, I just might kill you.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.127
It depends on a few things.

31:54.862 --> 31:57.729
When was the last time
your father kissed you?

31:57.899 --> 32:01.562
- I think that's your lamest question yet.
- Yeah?

32:03.905 --> 32:06.373
Think about your father.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.677
Good. Good.

32:12.847 --> 32:16.146
Now think about a time before
he was sent away to the institution.

32:16.317 --> 32:20.515
A happy time. A time when you
still believed that your father loved you.

32:33.568 --> 32:38.005
Beside his car and your old house, does
your father have any other hiding places?

32:38.539 --> 32:41.838
Answer the question.
Does your father ha...?

32:51.686 --> 32:55.087
Thank you.
You just told me where the cylinder is.

33:12.306 --> 33:13.864
Come with me.

33:48.342 --> 33:50.640
Shame you never met him.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.615
Come on.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.652
Dig.

34:10.031 --> 34:11.123
Careful.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.101
Olivia, over here.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.848
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. He went that way.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.043
Go. He's got a gun.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.596
Departure on schedule.

37:00.501 --> 37:01.593
Who the hell are you?

37:04.472 --> 37:06.406
What is the cylinder?

37:08.542 --> 37:10.601
- You know what it is?
- You know what it is?

37:10.778 --> 37:13.679
Why is it here? Why now?

37:17.051 --> 37:19.042
Who are you?

37:20.955 --> 37:22.889
Apples, bananas, rhinoceros.

37:23.057 --> 37:24.820
I wanna hold you hand.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.619
"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds."

37:26.794 --> 37:28.853
Do you really know my father?

37:29.030 --> 37:31.658
Did you talk to him this afternoon?

37:33.434 --> 37:36.062
Are you his friend?

38:45.706 --> 38:47.970
Peter, is he all right?

38:48.175 --> 38:51.633
He's fine. He has a mild concussion,
but he's gonna be fine.

38:51.812 --> 38:55.748
Thank you. That's wonderful news.

38:55.916 --> 38:58.146
Come on,
I'm gonna take you back to your hotel.

38:58.319 --> 39:02.756
If you don't mind,
there's something I'd like to do first.

39:17.772 --> 39:22.732
What I did to you
was very untrustworthy of me.

39:22.910 --> 39:26.778
I never intended to harm you.

39:27.448 --> 39:32.977
I was simply doing
what was necessary to protect us all.

39:37.658 --> 39:41.526
If it would help you feel
a sense of retribution...

39:41.729 --> 39:44.823
...I would tell you to inject me too.

39:46.267 --> 39:50.226
But I'd most likely enjoy it.

40:12.026 --> 40:16.725
Hi. Uh, Peter Bishop,
he was brought in about an hour ago.

40:16.897 --> 40:18.888
Excuse me.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.295
Hi.

40:23.037 --> 40:24.902
Are you okay?

40:26.173 --> 40:27.765
Yeah.

40:28.042 --> 40:29.703
I'm fine.

40:33.514 --> 40:38.008
- So did we recover your cylinder?
- We dug out the hole...

40:38.185 --> 40:41.052
...but there's no sign of it.
As soon as the sun comes up...

40:41.222 --> 40:44.988
...we'll bring in an excavator, but
I don't have an expectation we'll find it.

40:45.159 --> 40:46.490
So it just disappeared?

40:48.028 --> 40:50.519
We ID'd the shooter. John Mosely.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.166
Wanted for a double homicide
in Seattle last month.

40:53.334 --> 40:56.565
- A few drug-related felonies before that.
- Seattle?

40:57.238 --> 40:59.365
Came a long way
to try and get that thing.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.202
Another in a long line of questions.

41:09.183 --> 41:10.707
I should get back.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.877
As you can imagine, there are some
interagency fires to quash.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.545
NSA considered that device
their personal property.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.056
They're looking for an explanation.

41:21.428 --> 41:22.895
So I'll see you tomorrow?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.323
Yeah.

41:38.479 --> 41:40.208
Hi.

41:41.081 --> 41:43.242
You ready to get out of here?

41:49.490 --> 41:51.651
Something happened
out there tonight, Olivia.

41:52.793 --> 41:56.923
The Pattern that Broyles refers to,
I always thought it was nonsense.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.622
Inexplicable things happen
every single day.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.633
That does not mean that
there is any deeper significance.

42:02.803 --> 42:04.464
I know this is gonna sound insane.

42:04.638 --> 42:08.096
I know that it sounds insane,
but the man in the woods, he knew me.

42:08.275 --> 42:10.334
I don't know how,
but he was inside my head.

42:10.511 --> 42:12.638
He knew what I was going to say
before I said it.

42:12.813 --> 42:15.782
- The man I shot?
- No, the other guy, the bald guy.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.350
From your photos, Mr. No-Brows.

42:18.519 --> 42:21.613
- Peter, I didn't see anyone.
- You know me well enough to know...

42:21.789 --> 42:26.089
...these are the last words I would expect
to be saying, but what if Walter is right?

42:26.260 --> 42:28.490
What if this is just the beginning?

42:30.130 --> 42:32.360
Listen, you took
a pretty bad blow to the head.

42:32.533 --> 42:35.468
- You think I did this to myself?
- No, I just...

42:35.636 --> 42:39.595
I was wrong to demand
that you stay here.

42:39.773 --> 42:41.434
Walter is not your responsibility.

42:41.609 --> 42:44.601
As you've always said,
this was just supposed to be temporary.

42:44.778 --> 42:47.645
- You have your life.
- Olivia, did you hear what I just said?

42:47.815 --> 42:51.478
I mean, I'm a fairly open-minded guy.
But there are things happening here...

42:51.652 --> 42:57.488
...that I can't even begin to explain,
and I am not going anywhere until I can.

43:02.463 --> 43:04.363
In that case, you might want this.

43:05.466 --> 43:07.491
Your credentials have been approved.

43:08.802 --> 43:12.932
Civilian consultant to
the Department of Homeland Security.

43:17.311 --> 43:20.940
This mean I don't need an escort to
come into the federal building anymore?

43:21.348 --> 43:22.372
Yeah.

43:24.652 --> 43:27.018
Will it get me out of speeding tickets?

43:28.889 --> 43:30.584
Maybe.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.966
So let me tell you about my day,
Walter.

43:40.501 --> 43:44.369
I was abducted, tortured,
I had two wires shoved up my nose...

43:44.538 --> 43:47.336
...that were connected to a machine
I'd never seen before.

43:47.508 --> 43:51.171
But maybe the strangest part of the day
is that somehow, without talking...

43:51.345 --> 43:55.213
...I was able to answer a question
that I didn't have the answer to.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.411
Where I buried the capsule?

44:00.521 --> 44:02.853
How did I know that, Walter?

44:04.525 --> 44:05.856
I didn't know that.

44:06.026 --> 44:08.085
I didn't know
where the cylinder was buried.

44:08.262 --> 44:11.561
- You know it, son, because I know it.
- No, I didn't know...

44:11.732 --> 44:14.496
...because you didn't tell me.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.900
I didn't have to.

44:18.539 --> 44:25.604
You must adjust the way
you consider communications, ideas.

44:25.779 --> 44:31.740
Ideas can be absorbed through osmosis,
through proximity.

44:38.092 --> 44:41.994
You remember the night of the accident,
when you were young?

44:42.162 --> 44:43.959
- I was driving.
- Of course I remember.

44:44.131 --> 44:46.964
- Your mother was at home.
- I remember, Thanksgiving dinner.

44:47.134 --> 44:50.626
She was anxious for us to get there,
join everyone.

44:51.972 --> 44:54.600
When the car went off the road,
the ice was so thick...

44:54.775 --> 44:58.677
...that it held the vehicle for
what must have been two minutes.

44:58.846 --> 45:01.314
What does this have to do
with what happened today?

45:01.482 --> 45:07.682
I regained consciousness,
I saw your body contorted horribly.

45:07.855 --> 45:15.091
I reached for you, but the ice broke
and we sank into that dark water.

45:15.262 --> 45:17.856
And then you swam to shore
and saved us both. I know.

45:18.065 --> 45:19.589
No.

45:21.301 --> 45:26.796
I was unable to control my limbs in
that icy water. They wouldn't respond.

45:27.174 --> 45:32.077
I was incapable
of saving you or myself.

45:33.847 --> 45:37.305
We were dead, Peter, you and I.

45:38.118 --> 45:42.521
Until someone grabbed me,
and we were going up.

45:42.856 --> 45:47.190
We were saved, the both of us,
by a man that I had never met.

45:48.028 --> 45:51.020
A man that shouldn't have
been there at all.

45:51.198 --> 45:53.860
He pulled us to the shore.

45:54.802 --> 46:00.672
I remember that he was bald,
that he had no eyebrows.

46:01.475 --> 46:06.845
And as he set us down in the snow,
I recall his stare.

46:07.548 --> 46:14.044
Standing there in his suit, soaking wet,
seemingly indifferent to the cold.

46:16.123 --> 46:21.527
It was as if he knew my thoughts
before I did...

46:22.729 --> 46:25.527
...as if he were inside my head.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.905
Without speaking, he made it clear
that he would need me one day.

46:34.508 --> 46:37.272
A return favor, so to speak.

46:37.444 --> 46:38.843
And this is it.

46:39.446 --> 46:42.745
Today, what happened
with the capsule...

46:43.217 --> 46:45.708
I'm not sure how I knew...

46:45.886 --> 46:50.755
...about the vibrations,
the composition...

46:50.924 --> 46:56.123
...but then when I tested it myself,
heard the vibrations, felt them...

46:56.296 --> 46:59.925
...it was as if
an envelope had been opened...

47:00.100 --> 47:03.467
...and I could finally
read my instructions.

47:03.670 --> 47:09.040
Instantly, I knew
I had to protect the capsule for him.

47:10.477 --> 47:14.072
Who they are and what they want,
as a man of science...

47:14.248 --> 47:18.184
...I share your frustration
in not having these answers.

47:19.219 --> 47:23.087
But what I know
is that you are sitting here now.

47:23.423 --> 47:27.291
My son, alive.

47:36.803 --> 47:40.000
I know you must think me insane.

47:45.779 --> 47:48.714
Not nearly as much
as you might think.

48:28.655 --> 48:29.679
Hello, Liv.
