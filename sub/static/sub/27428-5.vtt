00:10.900 --> 00:12.480
When you're living with

00:12.500 --> 00:14.480
your best friends for the first time,

00:14.500 --> 00:17.079
it's everything you could've
hoped for and more.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.000
Every night is like a stony,

00:19.020 --> 00:21.710
snack-filled sleepover with your crew.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.320
You also end up learning about

00:23.340 --> 00:25.660
your friends'... domestic habits.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.640
Will you look at this and tell
me if the color's too dark?!

00:35.730 --> 00:39.180
_

00:45.350 --> 00:46.999
Mm.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.180
Ugh.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.139
But things can get kind of awkward

00:53.140 --> 00:55.240
when it comes to your
friend' bigger issues.

I knew Nomi was a player,
but this is next-level.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.560
Is homegirl starting a cult?

Is this about the Crispy Wheats?

02:05.320 --> 02:06.999
How do you get nine cents per wheat?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.719
Because it feels so high.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.460
It's so worth it, though,
because it's like a combination

02:11.470 --> 02:13.549
- of gluten and magic.
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.720
No, this is about the,
um, morning and nightly

02:17.760 --> 02:20.590
and sometimes midafternoon slut walks

02:20.630 --> 02:22.299
- happening in our apartment.
- Oh. Mm.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.000
Whoa, there. Let's... Let's not
start calling each other sluts.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.259
No, no, no, it's okay, Zoey.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.440
Women are taking back "slut."

02:27.450 --> 02:29.716
You're a slut, you're a slut, I'm
a slut. We can all be sluts.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.716
I meant slut in the way you
would want me to take it back.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.119
- Noted.
- Okay. Look, we're just having

02:33.120 --> 02:36.080
a-a volume issue and a volume issue.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.340
- Girl, you smash too loud.
- Just a little too loud.

02:38.350 --> 02:39.359
Oh.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.360
Look, we're not mad at you, right?

02:43.450 --> 02:44.750
- I'm not mad at you.
- Okay.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.650
It's just, having these bodies

02:46.690 --> 02:48.879
roam the halls every night

02:48.880 --> 02:50.660
is starting to throw off the vibe

02:50.690 --> 02:52.040
and the energy of our apartment.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.500
Yeah, but Luca's literally
here every day and night.

02:54.530 --> 02:57.439
But, like, Luca doesn't
really inconvenience you.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.700
He doesn't eat our food, he
doesn't use your shampoo,

02:59.740 --> 03:01.320
and, plus, he's a very quiet lover.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.700
And, Nomi, this week alone,
there's been like, what,

03:03.740 --> 03:05.570
- eight different women in here?
- Eight.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.059
- Was it eight?
- I mean, geez,

03:07.060 --> 03:09.170
I thought lesbians, like,
eloped to Portland

03:09.180 --> 03:10.219
after the first date.

03:10.220 --> 03:12.580
Okay. You need to update
your lesbian stereotypes.

03:12.620 --> 03:15.000
Also, reminder, I'm bisexual.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.380
And those women weren't
even lesbians. They're straight.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.180
- Huh.
- They're straight?

03:21.260 --> 03:23.320
H-How... How does that even work?

03:23.380 --> 03:24.860
I mean, pretty easily.

03:24.890 --> 03:27.079
Women in college all want to explore,

03:27.080 --> 03:29.240
and I provide a first-class
quality experience.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.840
I'm discrete, I take the lead,
and they have an amazing time.

03:31.850 --> 03:34.320
And the best part is,
I get to forget them

03:34.330 --> 03:38.710
and they never, like, ever forget me.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.520
You're a monster.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.510
Well, I... I think that

03:43.550 --> 03:46.260
the s-services you're
providing are great.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.320
You're like the Ritz-Carlton
of the lesbian experience.

03:49.340 --> 03:50.680
- I like that.
- But, you know,

03:50.720 --> 03:52.690
if you could go over to their place

03:52.720 --> 03:54.119
a few nights in the week,

03:54.120 --> 03:56.340
that would be much appreciated.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.080
Sure. Done.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.439
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.040
Starting tomorrow.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.120
- Okay.
- Totally.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.240
Making progress.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.700
Yo, Torres.

04:09.740 --> 04:11.670
What's up with that
petty-ass Venmo request

04:11.680 --> 04:13.439
for pizza toppings from the other night?

04:13.440 --> 04:15.400
Oh, I'd never put pineapple on pizza,

04:15.410 --> 04:17.420
- so I'm not gonna pay for it.
- Oh.

04:17.470 --> 04:20.059
So, not only are you cheap,
you have a deprived palate?

04:20.060 --> 04:22.019
Oh, please do not do that
thing that people do

04:22.040 --> 04:23.796
when you haven't tried
something and they overreact.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.420
- I'm not gonna do that, okay?
- Thank you.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.836
I was just gonna say
that I cannot believe

04:26.860 --> 04:28.256
you've never had pineapple on pizza.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.720
- It's like you've not lived yet.
- I'm living right now,

04:30.760 --> 04:33.100
and my life is totally fine
without hot fruit in it.

04:33.110 --> 04:35.280
Okay, well, I feel sad
for you, honestly.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.920
You want a ride?

04:36.960 --> 04:38.800
No, no. I don't do scooters.

04:38.830 --> 04:41.140
They're the pineapple
pizza of transportation.

04:41.220 --> 04:42.800
What? The...

04:42.840 --> 04:45.710
Oh, man. Wow. Fix
your life, girl. Please.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.470
- Okay.
- Whoa.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.850
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
- It's not funny.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.379
I'm gonna be late for class.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.720
- Can I just...
- Fix your life!

04:57.490 --> 04:58.720
♪ Yeah ♪

05:00.760 --> 05:03.720
Twerk Burger. What that mouth do?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.590
- Huh?
- Oh, my God.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.630
Damn, I can go for a
Twerk Burger right now.

05:07.660 --> 05:10.430
Mm. They got that Twerky sauce.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.460
Look, it's hard to deny the goodness

05:12.470 --> 05:14.380
that is the Double D
meal at Twerk Burger,

05:14.400 --> 05:16.570
but as a civilized
society, we have to agree

05:16.610 --> 05:19.380
that this commercial
is pandering trash...

05:19.400 --> 05:20.680
But what that mouth do?

05:20.700 --> 05:22.960
Aimed at the lowest
common denominator.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.810
Sorry.

05:24.850 --> 05:26.960
And with that, I will
see you all next class.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.999
I don't know, guys.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.279
Is it pandering?

05:30.280 --> 05:31.819
Or is it a company knowing its audience?

05:31.820 --> 05:34.650
Horny 19-year-olds, wildly
attractive young men

05:34.690 --> 05:37.140
who, for whatever reason,
can't find love with a woman,

05:37.240 --> 05:39.276
but can always find it between
the patties of a Twerk Burger.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.730
- Ain't that right, ma?
- Bitch, I will slap you.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.830
Okay, the point is that,
it's just patriarchal,

05:43.870 --> 05:45.999
toxic, male fantasy crap.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.380
Says the biggest misogynist in the room.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.740
I'm a woman. I can't be a misogynist.

05:50.770 --> 05:52.940
- Hey, Professor Hewson?
- Yeah?

05:52.960 --> 05:54.360
Hi. Quick question.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.880
Can a woman be a misogynist?

05:56.910 --> 06:00.379
Well, I guess if she's actively
working against her own gender.

06:00.380 --> 06:03.200
But, uh, I don't know, I'd
have to have context.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.120
Well, how about a woman
that's running through ladies

06:05.140 --> 06:07.520
like she's a fourth member of Migos?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.660
Well, that wasn't me
looking for context.

06:09.690 --> 06:12.320
Um, but I-I think that it has less to do

06:12.340 --> 06:14.590
with the amount of women
and more about why

06:14.630 --> 06:16.479
she's running through
them like the Migos.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.770
But, you know, you have to
unpack the motivation a bit.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.830
Anyway, you all know my office hours.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.560
Don't feel like you have to use them.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.200
I'm not a misogynist.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.740
Yeah, of course you're
not, because a misogynist,

06:27.780 --> 06:30.160
by definition, hates women,
and Nomi does nothing

06:30.180 --> 06:33.080
but love women loudly and
repetitively in our apartment.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.559
- Yes.
- Well, misogynist or not,

06:34.560 --> 06:35.779
she's acting like a gross,

06:35.780 --> 06:38.820
womanizing, yacht-riding Leo
DiCaprio in a wrap skirt.

06:38.850 --> 06:41.120
Hey, I don't see what the big deal is.

06:41.140 --> 06:43.299
Nobody gives guys crap for
running through girls.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.309
That's because for dudes,

06:44.310 --> 06:45.580
there's nothing really behind it.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.730
- It is what it is.
- It's just fun busting nuts.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.760
Exactly. Thank you. It's just fun.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.080
All three of you are monsters.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.200
Especially you.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.439
Esp... Why? Because women aren't allowed

06:56.440 --> 06:57.669
to enjoy busting nuts?

06:57.670 --> 07:00.360
No, it's because you're a
woman who's exclusively

07:00.380 --> 07:03.740
busting whatever with straight women.

07:03.780 --> 07:04.859
Oh.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.719
Is someone mad 'cause
they were too sloppy

07:06.720 --> 07:09.040
to remember our drunken kiss last year?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.699
- Huh?
- Wait. They kissed last year?

07:10.700 --> 07:12.420
- Yep.
- Nomi, please.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.260
- Wow.
- This is about you presenting yourself

07:14.280 --> 07:16.200
as some enlightened feminist

07:16.220 --> 07:19.560
when you're turning and burning
straight girls like a dude.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.180
Or lovingly appreciating women.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.000
And although they identify as straight,

07:24.020 --> 07:26.220
we all know sexuality is a spectrum.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.800
Yo, I hate to side with Ana on this,

07:27.840 --> 07:29.920
I really do, but smashing
only one type of person

07:29.930 --> 07:31.460
is like a dude targeting virgins.

07:31.470 --> 07:32.810
It's low-key problematic.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.200
Actually, it's high-key problematic.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.780
- And predatory.
- And pre...

07:36.810 --> 07:39.450
Okay, so now I'm a
misogynistic predator.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.550
You know, screw this. I'm out of here.

back to glitter masks

into other people's business

Well, you don't have to spend

your night out with a "predator."

08:28.480 --> 08:30.760
About that... um, I know what Ana said

- was upsetting and rude...
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.620
And not to make any
sort of excuses for her,

08:34.640 --> 08:37.239
but I feel like we should
take into consideration

08:37.240 --> 08:39.260
the fact that she's never
really lived with anyone

08:39.280 --> 08:40.818
- who's so radically different from her.
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.820 --> 08:41.950
Yeah. You know what?

08:41.960 --> 08:43.775
I actually didn't come
here to talk about this.

now and get drunk enough

09:32.840 --> 09:34.810
- Never worn a turtleneck?
- What? You know what?

09:34.850 --> 09:35.959
Don't sit here acting like

09:35.960 --> 09:37.356
I'm the only one that hasn't done stuff.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.459
This one over here has
never shotgunned a beer.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.939
- That's true. That's weird.
- I've never...

09:40.940 --> 09:41.949
You haven't done that yet.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.796
And that's mostly embarrassing,
because you've actually

09:43.820 --> 09:46.360
been in college a year
longer than all of us have.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.766
- Right?
- That's so true! I forgot!

09:47.790 --> 09:49.180
- Whatever.
- Ohh!

09:49.200 --> 09:50.900
I've never gotten white-girl wasted.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.100
- What?!
- What?!

09:52.110 --> 09:54.220
- Really?
- No, you haven't.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.300
I never let the haters get to me. Mm!

09:56.340 --> 09:58.680
- All right.
- Well, maybe you should.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.820
Yeah.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.716
Okay, wait, wait. So, that's what
we're gonna do tonight, guys.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.039
We are all gonna do something

10:03.040 --> 10:04.160
we have never done before. Yeah?

10:04.180 --> 10:05.739
- Okay.
- Yep. Cheers to that.

10:05.740 --> 10:06.759
- Cheers to that!
- Cheers to that!

10:06.760 --> 10:07.770
I'm in!

10:07.780 --> 10:09.786
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, get in!
- It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.560
All right, Torres, you're up first.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.980
- No, that's not fun.
- What that mouth do?

10:13.990 --> 10:15.900
- It'll be fun.
- Come on.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.420
Ew.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.220
- Yay!
- Delicious.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.830
Oh, hey, Zoey? This is Angela.

10:25.860 --> 10:28.700
She got stood up by
some dumb Tinder guy.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.040
I should've known better.

10:30.060 --> 10:33.140
His profile said he's
CEO of "Me Industries."

10:33.160 --> 10:36.079
Oof. Well, dumb Tinder guy messed up,

10:36.080 --> 10:39.380
because you are killing
it in that blue sweater.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.780
Thank you. It's actually "cerulean."

10:41.810 --> 10:43.420
And anytime I wear it, I feel like...

10:43.440 --> 10:44.896
Anne Hathaway in "The
Devil Wears Prada"?

10:44.920 --> 10:46.460
Yes! Oh, my God.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.180
That is one of my favorite movies ever.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.520
Yeah, because it's cinematic perfection.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.620
I personally like "Princess Diaries"

10:55.660 --> 10:57.790
as my favorite Anne Hathaway movie.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.340
While I sat there sipping
my second Midori Sour,

11:03.350 --> 11:06.700
feeling like the third wheel,
I watched Nomi in action.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.750
Her small talk wasn't like the
small talk guys do with girl.

11:17.780 --> 11:20.950
She connected with them in
a way only a woman could.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.220
Oh, my God. I dated a
dude just like that.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.479
Like, total gas-lighting dick.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.489
- Thank you.
- Mnh-mnh.

11:26.490 --> 11:28.460
- He made me feel like I was crazy.
- No.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.140
She was insightful, practically psychic,

11:31.200 --> 11:33.500
funny, and charismatic.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.320
She had that thing that
makes you feel like

11:37.340 --> 11:39.570
you're the only person
she wants to be with.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.870
But I knew the truth.

11:44.910 --> 11:47.740
This wasn't the only person
she wanted to be with,

11:47.780 --> 11:50.750
which is what made Nomi's
superpower so dangerous.

11:50.780 --> 11:52.526
- And I feel like... Oh.
- Hey, sorry to interrupt...

11:52.550 --> 11:53.856
Um, but I think I'm gonna head out.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.160
- You coming with?
- No, you're good, you're good.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.880
Anyway, I was...

11:57.890 --> 12:00.000
Sometimes when it feels like...

12:00.020 --> 12:03.730
So, this is what she meant by
sucker punching a freshman.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.120
Hmm.

12:05.140 --> 12:07.500
3, 2, 1, go!

12:07.530 --> 12:08.800
Oh, my God!

12:08.830 --> 12:10.570
Mmm.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.670
- Ew!
- Oh!

12:27.450 --> 12:28.780
- Whoo!
- What'd it feel like?

12:28.820 --> 12:31.750
♪ Baby, I might compare you ♪

12:31.790 --> 12:35.220
♪ To a kiss from a rose on the gray ♪

12:35.280 --> 12:39.700
♪ Ooh, the more I get of you,
the stranger it feels, yeah ♪

12:39.730 --> 12:41.560
♪ Yeah ♪

12:41.600 --> 12:44.099
As I struggle to eat my
Double Twerky with cheese

12:44.100 --> 12:45.870
while wearing Korean hand masks,

12:45.900 --> 12:48.040
anticipating an exciting evening

12:48.060 --> 12:50.710
of experimenting with my
new Fenty highlighters,

12:50.740 --> 12:52.840
I was trying not to be too judgmental

12:52.880 --> 12:54.640
about Nomi's behavior.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.500
But seeing her in action, I found myself

12:57.520 --> 13:00.180
definitely drifting into
the judgy territory.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.750
Hey, Nomi? Can we talk for a second?

13:02.790 --> 13:04.220
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Thank you.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.750
Just... I'll be right back.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.320
What's up?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.830
So, it seems like you and
Angela really hit it off.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.830
Oh, yeah, we did. She's, um...

13:12.860 --> 13:15.060
She's a Capricorn but
like a Scorpio rising,

13:15.080 --> 13:18.430
so, uh, I'm in for a wild night.

13:18.470 --> 13:20.460
Okay. But what about after that?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.320
In for a wild tomorrow?

13:23.740 --> 13:26.139
Dude, are you, like, on some
Ana bullshit or something?

13:26.140 --> 13:28.680
No, it just feels like
you draw these women in,

13:28.710 --> 13:30.780
because you obviously know
how they think and feel.

13:30.820 --> 13:33.550
Uh-huh. Yeah. Well,
that's kind of the point.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.219
Right. But... it feels unfair,

13:36.220 --> 13:38.380
like you have some sort of
cheat codes or something.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.720
So? What, are you... you faulting me

13:40.760 --> 13:42.636
'cause I have, like, better
game than a dude, or...?

13:42.660 --> 13:46.380
No, G... I'm for sure not
faulting you for that.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.239
So, that girl's only in my room

13:48.240 --> 13:49.799
'cause she wants to be in my room.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.839
All right, great.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.640
Well, then, if that's the case,
why don't you go in there

13:53.670 --> 13:56.720
and tell her that you're
gonna ghost her tomorrow?

14:06.820 --> 14:09.460
Dumb Tinder guy just texted me.

14:09.470 --> 14:12.380
- Uh-huh.
- Apparently, his deejay class got out late.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.750
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:13.790 --> 14:16.320
Yeah. I mean, you know,
it could take a while

14:16.330 --> 14:18.259
to learn how to push buttons and yell,

14:18.260 --> 14:20.800
"You already know what it is!"

14:24.730 --> 14:29.470
Um... I wanna be up front with you.

14:29.510 --> 14:31.840
I'm not really looking
for anything serious.

14:31.880 --> 14:35.640
And, uh, the chances of
me calling you tomorrow,

14:35.680 --> 14:39.700
or ever, are slim.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.560
Uh...

14:44.620 --> 14:46.260
Sounds good to me.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.700
It's not like I was
looking to take you home

14:47.710 --> 14:49.100
to Mom and Dad or anything.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.690
Yeah.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.560
Right.

15:00.670 --> 15:01.846
It's been the best night of my life.

15:01.870 --> 15:03.300
I didn't know my voice had the ability

15:03.320 --> 15:04.816
- to capture an audience like that.
- Yeah, man.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.880
- I know.
- See?

15:05.890 --> 15:07.500
Felt like I was being held captive.

15:07.510 --> 15:08.520
That's funny.

15:08.530 --> 15:09.540
- Good night!
- See you guys.

15:09.550 --> 15:10.610
Night, dude.

15:12.850 --> 15:15.720
Still haven't ridden
one of those things.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.000
Well, then, our work here isn't done.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.200
- Come on.
- Okay.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.020
Okay, hold on.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.690
All right.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.100
It is not that fast, yo.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.420
Safe and sound.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.700
Thank you.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.600
Thanks for the ride.

15:37.610 --> 15:38.940
No prob.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.539
Vivek wasn't wrong. This...

15:40.540 --> 15:42.340
- This was a pretty great night.
- Yeah.

15:42.350 --> 15:46.120
And I suppose the
pineapple was okay, too.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.180
- Oh, just okay?
- Whatever, dude.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.440
- You ate nine pieces.
- Okay, then,

15:50.450 --> 15:54.380
I guess I'm not always
right about everything.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.950
Yeah.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.280
Yeah.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.200
I, uh, better head out.

16:01.630 --> 16:02.880
Okay.

16:02.890 --> 16:05.060
I'm gonna Venmo request
you about this ride, too.

16:05.070 --> 16:07.260
- Don't think I'm not.
- Hey, what's fair is fair.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.479
- All right, good night.
- Good night.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.500
What the hell?

16:10.540 --> 16:11.799
Okay.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.826
- Now, it's a perfect night.
- How did the thing just stop?

16:13.850 --> 16:15.220
You probably just turned it on wrong.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.080
- Oh, so now you're an expert?
- Yeah.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.940
You know, there's one more
thing I haven't done before.

16:26.020 --> 16:28.490
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.580
What's that?

16:48.750 --> 16:50.240
Come on in.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.780
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:52.820 --> 16:55.720
I took your advice. Yeah,
I was honest with her.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.120
And?

16:57.620 --> 16:59.360
She was still down to hook up.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.140
Well, that... that's good.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.060
Yeah, I guess.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.260
I mean, until she said she had no plans

17:05.280 --> 17:07.339
of taking me home to her mom and dad.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.800
But that's what you wanted, right?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.730
Yeah.

17:11.770 --> 17:14.540
I think so. I don't know.

17:14.569 --> 17:15.858
I did, until she said that,

17:15.859 --> 17:17.869
and then it just, like...
it kind of messed me up.

17:17.910 --> 17:21.890
So, you telling me you caught
real feelings for this girl,

17:21.900 --> 17:24.450
- by any chance?
- No. No, I did not catch feeling for her.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.300
I just... I think that,

17:26.319 --> 17:27.699
it's, like, when she said to me

17:27.700 --> 17:31.000
what I've been saying to
all these other girls...

17:31.180 --> 17:34.360
suddenly, everything
felt really, um, wrong.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.860
- Yeah.
- So, now what?

17:39.900 --> 17:42.560
- As much as I wished I did...
- Um...

17:42.580 --> 17:44.699
I didn't have any answers for Nomi,

17:44.700 --> 17:47.300
so I just listened.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.879
And the next day,

17:49.880 --> 17:51.739
Nomi decided to sit down with someone

17:51.740 --> 17:54.200
who could help her a little
better than I could.

17:54.710 --> 17:56.620
Well, hooking up with a bunch of girls

17:56.630 --> 17:58.910
doesn't sound like compulsive behavior.

17:58.950 --> 18:00.440
Sounds like college.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.720
Okay, but as a gender studies professor,

18:02.750 --> 18:05.650
what would you say about a girl who...

18:05.690 --> 18:08.020
only hooks up with straight girls?

18:08.460 --> 18:09.920
Hmm.

18:09.980 --> 18:12.790
I would say, let's cut
right through the bullshit

18:12.830 --> 18:14.800
and talk gay woman to bi-woman.

18:14.830 --> 18:17.640
- How did you know that?
- I have good bi-dar.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.950
Now, look, I went through
a straight girl phase.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.120
Mm-hmm.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.459
And for me, it was about safety.

18:23.460 --> 18:24.540
Mm-hmm.

18:24.550 --> 18:26.886
'Cause there was no chance of
anything ever getting serious.

18:26.910 --> 18:29.110
Yes. No, exactly.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.079
It's like, there's no relationship,
so there's no feelings,

18:31.080 --> 18:33.710
there's no bringing them
back home at Thanksgiving

18:33.750 --> 18:37.080
and be like, "Hey, Mom and Dad,
here's my new girlfriend."

18:37.450 --> 18:39.350
You know, and then they,
like, spit Manischewitz

18:39.380 --> 18:41.320
all over the table and...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.620
So, then I take it your parents

18:43.660 --> 18:45.760
are not okay with you being bi?

18:45.800 --> 18:50.280
Um... the truth is, they don't know.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.960
That's, um... That's
the problem, isn't it?

19:00.020 --> 19:02.680
- I'm not a therapist.
- Mm-hmm.

19:02.710 --> 19:04.180
But it made my life easier

19:04.200 --> 19:06.220
when I started living
openly and honestly.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.639
Hmm.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.000
So, maybe you start there

19:09.010 --> 19:11.720
and just see how the rest of
the stuff falls into place.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.180
Yeah.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.080
Okay, here's your bravery test.

19:15.490 --> 19:17.440
Well, maybe not too big today.

19:17.470 --> 19:20.690
How about just a little
tree that lives right here?

19:20.730 --> 19:22.180
Hey.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.760
You look happier.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.180
Yeah, it was cool. I mean, it was, like,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.980
great to talk to somebody who
kind of gets it, you know?

19:28.990 --> 19:31.570
- Yeah, you know, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.200
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
back and keep talking to her

19:33.220 --> 19:35.580
- and make her, like, a Migos playlist.
- Hmm. Quality.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.710
Hmm? Oh.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.379
I'm sorry I judged your choices.

19:43.380 --> 19:47.280
Apparently, I'm not always
right about everything.

19:52.830 --> 19:55.340
So, while it was obvious
that there was work to do

19:55.350 --> 19:57.240
to get through the bigger issue,

19:57.260 --> 19:59.800
those bigger issues helped
put the smaller ones

19:59.820 --> 20:01.120
into perspective.

20:01.140 --> 20:02.770
Okay, be honest.

20:02.780 --> 20:06.380
This dude, if he had corn
rows, would you hit it?

20:08.510 --> 20:10.020
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.580
- The dude's soothing, so...
- Why? Do you know him?

20:12.620 --> 20:16.620
Do I know Bob Ross? No, I mean...

20:16.650 --> 20:19.200
I... No, I don't. Sorry.
