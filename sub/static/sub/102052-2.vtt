01:12.489 --> 01:13.323
Hi.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.745
Boo.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.456
Water and dirt.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.166
-You analyzed it?
The Headwoods did.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.751
It's nothing.

01:24.834 --> 01:28.797
It's exactly what you'd expect,
so why did you sample this?

01:31.299 --> 01:33.301
-Was there ammonium sulfate in it?
Mmm-hmm.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.887
It's probably volcanic. So what?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.516
He warned me about this.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.726
He said that you hold back.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.853
-It's your main move.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.065
He said that there's two
different types of people in this world.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.067
There's Dreamers and there's Schemers.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.985
Dreamers can build the world up,

01:51.069 --> 01:53.363
but the Schemers
slither their way through.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.074
-What do you think?
-That he says a lot when he's high.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.536
It was snowing outside.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.413
From the sky?

02:02.497 --> 02:03.540
From the sky.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.917
Mmm-hmm. That's impossible.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.085
It should be, but I saw it.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.254
We don't get snow, it's too cold.

02:09.879 --> 02:12.382
We get blowing snow and old precip.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.218
You might get into his head,
but you're not getting into mine.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.345
Lights out.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.516
<i>When Alex was old enough,</i>

02:22.350 --> 02:24.394
<i>she helped me hose down the ash pits.</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:28.314
<i>And I'd warn her, like my dad warned me,</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:30.275
<i>of the heat lurking inside.</i>

02:30.859 --> 02:33.862
<i>Ready to smolder to life,</i>
<i>like a visit from a ghost.</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:36.781
<i>These are her revolutions now.</i>

02:38.074 --> 02:42.829
<i>On</i> Snowpiercer, <i>1,034 cars long.</i>

03:11.316 --> 03:12.400
Good morning.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.447
Hey, maybe stay out of Third today.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.282
I gotta help Dr. Pelton today.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.408
I'll be fine.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.245
Look, the Tail
is still angry with you, Zarah.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.831
Give it some time to cool off down there.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.958
Ask Pelton to work
in the Second Class clinic.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.460
Okay.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.503
Don't worry, I'll be safe.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.633
I was thinking,
this kid's gonna need a name, right?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.176
-Pretty sure that's how it works.

03:38.259 --> 03:42.221
Well, if it's a girl, how would you feel
about naming it after your mom?

03:43.389 --> 03:45.350
And if it's a boy?

03:46.434 --> 03:47.435
Trotsky.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.687
We'll talk about this later.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.150
Hey. One second.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.490
Nice to see you two landed on your feet.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.866
It's for Zarah and the baby.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.744
Yeah, no, no.
It's good to have a place to call home.

04:05.703 --> 04:06.871
Hey, Andre.

04:08.873 --> 04:09.791
I'm proud of you.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.211
Don't be weird.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.088
Come on.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.887
-How's the train holding together?
-Better than me.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.931
Half the train thinks
Wilford's here to kill us,

04:25.014 --> 04:27.016
the other half think he's here to save us.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.017
From you.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.519
They might all be right.

04:29.602 --> 04:34.023
And adding 400 Tailies to the population
hasn't exactly lowered the temperature.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.609
There was an assault
near the Tea Room last night.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.945
A Tailie woman got maimed.

04:39.028 --> 04:39.862
Who?

04:40.822 --> 04:41.906
I don't know.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.491
-Can you find out what happened?
-Me?

04:43.574 --> 04:45.326
Uh, on what authority?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.079
I'm not a Brakeman anymore, Layton.
I just...

04:49.580 --> 04:51.499
I just follow you around.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.836
All right, let's fix that.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.337
-What?
-Come on.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.216
Roche, stand up. Let's do this.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.676
What, now?
Yeah.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.428
Bess Till, please raise your right hand.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.804
Oh, come on.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.766
Bess Till, I hereby
pronounce you Train Detective.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.143
No. I didn't ask for this.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.353
Imagine anyone
asking for any of this.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.396
I'm not ready.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.481
-He's giving you a promotion.
-I don't want it!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.320
I've seen enough blood for a while.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.530
We're all shaky, but we are in charge now.

05:22.613 --> 05:25.450
And we have a responsibility
to the rest of the passengers.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.745
All right.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.330
What do you want me to do?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.499
We have to interrogate a POW in here.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.793
So, if you could
get on top of this assault thing,

05:35.877 --> 05:39.255
-I would appreciate it.
-Detective, congratulations.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.132
It was a really beautiful ceremony.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.634
Ladies and gentlemen, Detective Bess Till.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.775
Kevin McMahon.
Born in Buffalo, New York.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.736
Ticketed on <i>Snowpiercer</i>
as a Hospitality Apprentice.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.196
I'm Head of Department now.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.322
Come on, cheers.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.074
How many people you looking after there?

06:07.366 --> 06:09.452
I'm gonna decline to answer. Thanks.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.413
You guys looked hungry.
How're your food systems holding up?

06:13.998 --> 06:14.874
Pass.

06:14.957 --> 06:15.875
Look,

06:17.126 --> 06:18.711
you don't have to fear Wilford.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.921
You're safe up here.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.089
Fear him?

06:23.007 --> 06:24.133
I adore the man.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.097
I remember you. Security, right?

06:29.180 --> 06:31.641
Walked around with your little earpiece.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.893
Cleared the room before he entered.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.061
Kind of like a doorman.

06:36.104 --> 06:36.979
Kinda.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.108
Security, Engineering, Agriculture,

06:40.191 --> 06:41.359
it's all just plumbing.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.568
But Hospitality...

06:44.362 --> 06:45.696
Hospitality comes from the heart.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.824
It's a culture.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.326
It's a kind of love.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.121
He'll come for me.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.167
That's all I'm gonna say.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.477
Is that real?

07:16.561 --> 07:17.645
Real chicken? Yeah.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.315
It's real vinegar, real cayenne.
It's Buffalo style, just like home.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.650
-Dig in.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.246
Tell us about the big guy
with the baseball mitt for a face.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.206
Why wasn't he affected by the cold?

07:38.416 --> 07:39.417
Okay...

07:40.126 --> 07:42.211
I don't know.
He was augmented for cold resistance.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.547
-How?
I don't know.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.049
Uh, grafting, uh, synthetic skin stuff.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.968
-I'm not a scientist.
-Okay.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.219
-Uh-uh!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.180
-How many crew aboard <i>Big Alice?</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:54.599
Estimate. Guess. Ten? Twenty?

07:57.685 --> 07:58.519
Fifty?

08:03.232 --> 08:04.066
Hundred?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.917
Have a seat. He'll be out shortly.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.552
No. Thanks, though.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.014
Morning! Whoo-hoo!

08:35.097 --> 08:36.182
How'd everyone sleep?

08:37.767 --> 08:38.643
Not good?

08:39.685 --> 08:42.563
Well, reunions can be a little tricky.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.069
Alex told me about
your little research project outside.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.446
-Bit of a dud, by the sounds of it.
Yeah.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.531
Yeah, looks that way.

08:52.615 --> 08:56.452
The thing about your mother,
Alex, is she's a tinkerer.

08:56.536 --> 09:01.249
Decent with a set of calipers,
but... don't expect much vision.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.926
I know you think you've stalemated us,

09:12.009 --> 09:14.345
but we still have moves, don't we, Alex?

09:14.428 --> 09:17.640
We can apply the brakes, slow to a crawl.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.434
Choke out your power,
and shut down your systems.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.477
And yours.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.063
My crew know life below zero.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.440
We've run a lot of rough miles together.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.651
<i>Snowpiercer</i> will tear herself apart.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.320
It's a hell of a test for a leader,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.864
when the lights go out
and the food stops flowing.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.411
How long do you think
this Mr. Layton will last?

09:41.205 --> 09:42.790
I think he might surprise you.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.586
I guess I'd better meet him, then.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.426
Movement.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.889
-Hey, don't touch it.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.725
I mean, it could be poison, right?

10:00.808 --> 10:01.976
Get Hospitality.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.395
Hospitality! Make way!

10:11.819 --> 10:12.903
Rose.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.322
It's a communiqué.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.288
Communiqué! Clear the way!

10:27.209 --> 10:28.044
Make way!

10:29.003 --> 10:30.588
Communiqué coming through!

10:49.815 --> 10:52.443
-It's in Wilford's own hand.
-Ruth.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.861
-It's impeccable.
Ruth!

10:53.944 --> 10:56.822
All right. Mr. Wilford suggests
that we got off on the wrong foot.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.866
And he would like to meet you, Mr. Layton.

10:58.949 --> 11:03.204
He suggests that that happens at
a formal prisoner swap, Melanie for Kevin.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.664
Okay. We have to make that happen.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.040
Might put a bullet in your head.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.668
That's nonsense.
Let's not assume bad faith.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
If we're stuck together,
we should start talking.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.422
Yes, I have to run
two engines in sync with him now.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.633
Why would he hand over Melanie?
What's the play?

11:15.716 --> 11:18.344
Mr. Wilford, unlike some,
values Hospitality.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.806
Laugh at me all you like, Mr. Roche.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.350
I'm telling you that Kevin
is a bigger chip than you realize.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.354
Okay. Well, if it's an even exchange,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.272
then what he really wants
is to look at us.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.608
So, we'll watch him, too.

11:32.691 --> 11:35.277
We know they number about 100
and they're hungry.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.445
That's good leverage.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.823
Let's bring Melanie home.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.033
Tell him we have a deal.

11:52.711 --> 11:53.921
Nice to see you, Roche.

11:54.922 --> 11:55.756
How's Anne?

11:58.384 --> 11:59.635
She's great, sir.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.928
Oh, good.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.222
And is that... Is that Ruth Wardell?

12:03.305 --> 12:05.599
-Oh...
Have you changed your hair?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.476
-Yes, sir, I have.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.520
And might I say, on behalf of everyone,

12:09.603 --> 12:11.730
how truly grateful
we are to see you again.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.482
Okay. Let's get this done.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.153
Oh, and here he is
in the flesh, King Layton.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.947
No, sir. No kings here.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.908
<i>Snowpiercer</i> belongs to the people now.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.243
Oh, does she?

12:24.952 --> 12:25.870
Well, then,

12:26.704 --> 12:29.457
could you please ask the people

12:30.207 --> 12:33.335
-to produce my Head of Hospitality?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.045
Uh...
Rules first.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.841
No one crosses
the no-man's-land but the prisoners.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.760
Any sudden moves
will be taken as a sign of aggression.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.054
Agreed.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.099
Bring him.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.978
Oh. I'm fine, Mr. Wilford. I'm okay.

12:51.061 --> 12:51.896
Hi, Kevin.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.110
I wanna see Alex before I go.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.778
Next time, Melanie.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.864
We'll come to you.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.450
All right, King Layton.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.535
With your permission.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.135
Wait!

13:25.638 --> 13:26.847
-Take the shot!
Her daughter!

13:26.931 --> 13:28.891
-No! Stop!
Hold your fire!

13:37.191 --> 13:38.108
You forgot this.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.157
Just tell me what it is.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.868
I don't know yet.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.579
Come with me.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.957
We'll study it together.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.177
No, you're seven years too late.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.699
So, how's your train, Layton?

14:26.782 --> 14:29.285
Passengers
are starting to show cracks.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.786
Old divides run deep.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.831
What about <i>Big Alice?</i>
What's Wilford's next move?

14:33.914 --> 14:35.332
I don't think he knows yet.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.501
He planned this attack for years,

14:37.585 --> 14:38.669
now he's improvising.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.462
Is that why he turned you over?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.714
Study our side?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.300
Study you. He's coming for you, Layton.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.676
Make no mistake.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.474
Your daughter okay?

14:55.185 --> 14:56.270
She's cruel.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.897
And she's confused.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.401
She hates me.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.194
So she's a teenager.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.408
You were out there a long time,
we should get you to a doctor.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.744
No. To the Engine.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.412
I need to talk to Ben and Javi.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.291
Excuse me.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.842
What did he say?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.678
I need to see the woman
who was assaulted last night.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.347
She don't wanna see no Brakeman.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.849
Then it's a good thing
Layton made me Train Detective.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.810
-Hey, back it up, yo! Back up!
Get off!

15:36.894 --> 15:39.939
She fought alongside you!
Now get out of my doorway!

15:40.022 --> 15:41.106
Thanks.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.317
Whatever it's worth,

15:43.400 --> 15:45.736
I don't know
if you're gonna get much further.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.283
Lights.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.827
Bess.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.789
Can you tell me what happened?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.958
They cut off her fingers.

15:59.041 --> 15:59.917
Who?

16:01.126 --> 16:03.796
I... I didn't see faces.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.299
They put a bag over my head and piled on.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.634
She was up by the Tea Room.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.720
Do you know
what weapon they used on your fingers?

16:12.596 --> 16:13.597
Axe, maybe.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.516
Jesus Christ, this place...

16:15.599 --> 16:17.935
Can I go?
-It's a message to the Tail.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.978
They went at the hand so she can't work.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.814
I just want back downtrain.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.066
There's no place for us up there.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.860
-Look, I'm trying to help you, Lights.
-It's too late.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.202
I took a sample of the snow.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.414
And it turns out
there's ammonium sulfate in it.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.541
-How do you know?
-Do you remember the Headwoods?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.835
They survived.
They have a whole wet lab over there.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.545
They're studying tissue regeneration.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.838
That, by the way,

16:45.921 --> 16:48.173
was third-degree frostbite
when they first treated it.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.758
It's almost completely healed.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.594
Back up. Ammonium sulfate in the snow?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.555
Volcanic?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.849
I think it was CW-7.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.892
I think it denatured in the atmosphere,

16:59.476 --> 17:00.561
and now it's coming down.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.979
Why? Why would you think that?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.772
Because it was snowing, Javi.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.358
Something's happening out there.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.110
Something's changing.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.904
If the CW-7's falling, "if..."

17:12.156 --> 17:13.991
we need to know for how long.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.786
We need to find out the rate.
We need to find out the altitude...

17:23.709 --> 17:25.377
-Hey.
Hey.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.133
I'm glad you're back aboard.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.929
Let's get on this, huh?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.307
Train could use some good news.

17:38.807 --> 17:39.850
Yes, boss.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.696
Here to give my report, sir.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.947
Ah!

17:55.032 --> 17:57.159
Here he is.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.202
Come in.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.664
You had me worried, son.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.249
I know, I'm very sorry.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.919
But rest assured, they treated me fine.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.754
Good.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.256
How hot do you want the water?

18:12.674 --> 18:13.509
For me?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.511
You must be exhausted.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.346
Oh...
-You've earned a good soak.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.057
Ah, that's very generous. But I--
-Kevin.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.433
Let me do this for you.

18:22.810 --> 18:23.644
Come on.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.606
You can scrub while you tell me
all about what you saw up there.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.067
Well...

18:30.984 --> 18:34.822
They seem to be rolling fine mechanically,
but socially, they're shambles.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.533
Protocol is ignored, borders open.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.285
Don't think
they even have classes anymore.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.745
And Layton?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.456
Winging it, as far as I can tell.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.127
He keeps Hospitality out of key decisions.
I saw that with my own eyes.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.090
People don't know... where they belong,

18:53.882 --> 18:54.716
how to be.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.301
We saw it at the border.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.763
No chain of command,
everyone second-guessing.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.098
Exactly.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.725
Totally untenable.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.608
And what did you reveal about us?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.029
Nothing.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.323
Only that...

19:19.908 --> 19:20.784
all is well.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.744
Did they feed you?

19:26.623 --> 19:27.457
No.

19:29.626 --> 19:33.005
No, they offered me chicken, but...

19:34.173 --> 19:35.757
So, yes, I had a few bites.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.803
But it was lunchtime,
so it seemed appropriate.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.267
I need the room, Alex.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.270
I can get out.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.147
No need. Stay.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.774
Stay.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.868
You showed them we were hungry, Kevin.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.870
That's a secret.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.539
It's a vulnerability.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.291
Oh...

20:52.251 --> 20:53.252
Sir, it was...

20:54.419 --> 20:56.505
It was just a few wings.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.343
And what about
the mango you got at the border?

21:03.011 --> 21:04.137
Hmm?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.395
I thought it would boost morale.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.278
You opened the door for them.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.073
You let them into my house.

21:23.949 --> 21:24.783
So...

21:26.618 --> 21:27.869
here we are.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.634
I don't think I can do this.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.052
It's been an honor, son.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.013
An honor.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.181
You served the mission well.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.278
Who will run Hospitality?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.906
You're free of that now, Kevin.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.867
All your troubles.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.536
You're warm,

22:10.537 --> 22:11.788
and you're free.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.810
-Dr. Pelton asked me to bring you these.
Thanks.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.187
-Can you put them in the recovery room?
Sure.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.261
Josie.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.932
You met our Jane Doe.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.893
Couple of Jackboots brought her in
just before the fighting started.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.270
Severe frostbite.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.688
-She hasn't woken up yet?
No.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.858
She may not. She's in terrible shape,
her whole body basically.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.195
-Do you know her?
-No.

24:37.684 --> 24:38.977
I'm sorry, Josie.

25:03.084 --> 25:03.960
Oh, no.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.963
No, no, no.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.896
Excuse me.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.345
Uh, Pastor Logan?

25:56.012 --> 25:58.306
I'm Bess Till.
I'm the new Train Detective.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.349
Ah...

26:00.225 --> 26:02.936
I guess this is about
the assault down the corridor.

26:03.019 --> 26:06.022
I was hoping one of your visitors
might've seen something.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.191
Well, I always listen.
I'll ask around for you.

26:08.858 --> 26:10.235
These are strange times.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.861
-Hmm.
-That poor woman.

26:13.321 --> 26:16.199
The Tailies have been through so much.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.535
Well, you would know that
as well as anyone.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.287
You were a Brakeman, right?

26:22.789 --> 26:25.500
Uh, which team are you on, Pastor Logan?

26:25.583 --> 26:30.297
Ah... Here.
Moravian Bible, 1716.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.715
In the original German.

26:32.632 --> 26:33.800
Makes you an Evangelical.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.885
You know your stuff.

26:35.969 --> 26:39.264
Hmm, my dad was, uh...
Jesus-y.

26:41.850 --> 26:42.726
And the teacup?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.729
Whatever faith you stand at,

26:45.812 --> 26:47.689
you see our cup from a different angle.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.066
The same cup,

26:50.692 --> 26:52.527
cracked and wise.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.362
Just a reminder.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.823
We all contemplate one God.

26:56.906 --> 27:00.493
Put another way, we're all crammed
in here together, so we better get along.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.661
And, um...

27:02.495 --> 27:03.330
do you?

27:04.164 --> 27:05.123
Most days.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.251
These are strange times, like you say.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.880
How's the train feeling to you?

27:11.963 --> 27:13.131
I mean,

27:13.715 --> 27:16.676
Wilford was dead,
and now he's resurrected.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.678
It's a powerful narrative.

27:20.180 --> 27:24.726
Some people will bend their faith...

27:25.810 --> 27:26.853
to fit the moment.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.814
You mean Wilford believers?

27:34.235 --> 27:35.403
You said four ounces.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.405
You're light.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.865
Quality control sample.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.326
It passed, my friend, with flying colors.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.203
I'd take more.

27:43.286 --> 27:47.040
Well, supply has been
temporarily interrupted, geopolitically.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.167
Layton's raid locked down the border.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.211
-Your payment.
Hmm.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.880
Who would have thought

27:54.381 --> 27:56.925
that weed and <i>Encyclopedia Britannicas...</i>

27:57.717 --> 27:58.802
would become gold?

27:58.885 --> 28:01.137
Boss, we've got some visitors.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.395
Ah!

28:10.522 --> 28:11.815
Oh, what a handsome couple.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.859
I want back in, Terence.
This new train means new opportunities.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.487
You're gonna need more muscle.
I'm good with my fists.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.323
-And your friend?
-I have connections.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.992
Oh, maybe you haven't heard.
There isn't a First Class anymore.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.496
My connections aren't on this train.
They're on the one behind us. Thanks.

28:26.579 --> 28:27.956
Her family was tight with Wilford.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.875
And when he rules this train,
you're gonna want me close.

28:30.959 --> 28:31.918
Trust me.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.462
But not that close, am I right?

28:36.756 --> 28:38.633
I don't need
the kind of trouble you two bring.

28:38.716 --> 28:39.968
We will work for it.

28:40.593 --> 28:43.221
-Oh, you wanna work?
-Yeah.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.056
It's cool.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.225
Septic's backing up in the Market.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.228
Yeah, we'll take it.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.570
You know where Audrey is?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.196
Thank you.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.123
So there's weed now?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.584
Old habits return.

29:14.878 --> 29:15.712
Sit.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.426
How far would you go...

29:22.010 --> 29:23.595
to protect your chance at a new life?

29:23.678 --> 29:27.557
Are you talking about
your baby or Andre or yourself?

29:27.640 --> 29:30.059
I'm talking about all of it, Audrey.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.311
Oh, but it's all at risk?

29:36.441 --> 29:40.695
The father of your child
has to prepare for Wilford, Zarah.

29:41.362 --> 29:44.240
He's <i>Snowpiercer's</i>
only chance at a new life.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.493
And whatever you're weighing,

29:47.410 --> 29:48.244
protect him.

29:48.953 --> 29:49.996
Whatever the cost.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.041
God damn it.
I have to get this song right.

29:55.919 --> 29:59.130
None of our hands are clean, darling.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.730
CW-7 is the compound
that was shot into the atmosphere

30:15.813 --> 30:17.649
to reflect the sun
and reverse global warming.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.400
Yeah, I recall how that ended up.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.069
Yeah, it cascaded an ice age.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.822
But if Mel's theory is right,
it might be breaking up and coming down.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.866
Which changes
every climate model we've ever made.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.368
As in makes it warmer?

30:28.451 --> 30:31.162
Because we announce the temperature
every day. It is still cold.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.706
Down here.
Which is why we're looking up above.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.252
Wait.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.797
Minus 96.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.758
Minus 86.

30:43.841 --> 30:45.802
Welcome back, you beauty.

30:45.885 --> 30:48.721
If this is really happening,
then how long will it take?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.473
Well, we have to figure that out, but...

30:51.891 --> 30:52.892
it's happening.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.520
The Earth is coming back to life.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.248
Layton.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.961
I'm gonna need access
to Wilford's supply cars.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.963
Batteries,
meteorological equipment, transport.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.047
The problem is this.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.092
He's never gonna willingly sign up
for anything he's not in charge of.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.594
<i>Snowpiercer</i> needs a rallying cry,

31:27.677 --> 31:29.596
or we're gonna
start tearing each other apart.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.097
That's what he's hoping for.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.141
Yeah, so maybe this is how we beat him.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.518
-The mission is hope.
-Yes, it is.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.813
Wilford, he doesn't
just want a castle, right?

31:38.897 --> 31:41.024
He wants a court. He needs to be revered.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.694
Old Ivan, my mentor in the Tail,
we used to play a lot of chess.

31:44.777 --> 31:48.406
And he had a defense for an opponent
with an ego and the opening move.

31:48.489 --> 31:51.576
The Caro-Kann.
Give him the center of the board at first.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.913
Wilford wants to fight hope,
we make him do it out in the open,

31:54.996 --> 31:56.414
in front of his people, too.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.875
It's risky.
You give him a stage, he'll put on a show.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.794
We gotta engage with him at some point,
for the mission to succeed.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.714
-Ruth.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.300
Layton, you need her on your side.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.406
Make way. Stand aside.
Communiqué coming through.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.326
Oh, well...

32:34.369 --> 32:36.079
Look who's joined the working classes.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.789
Ruth, gosh, hi.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.333
Uh, Mr. Osweiller is teaching me
about how work is a commodity.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.501
-Uh...

32:41.584 --> 32:42.543
Oh, please,

32:42.627 --> 32:45.088
-I'm so excited. Is that for Mr. Wilford?
-Never you mind.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.675
But we might be seeing him
sooner than you think.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.183
A message, sir.

33:06.359 --> 33:09.404
They have an urgent
scientific discovery to discuss.

33:09.987 --> 33:12.115
They're proposing a summit...

33:13.241 --> 33:14.701
in First Class Dining.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.411
That's a nonstarter.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.204
It has something to do with that sample.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.373
I knew she wasn't being straight with me.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.750
Or it's a bluff. To draw you out.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.794
It's true, I'd be exposed.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.504
But then again, so would they.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.382
It's an audience, Sykes.

33:29.465 --> 33:30.633
It's an opening.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.969
An opening? To what, to attacking them?

33:33.678 --> 33:34.637
Not them.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.389
Him.

33:37.890 --> 33:38.975
Oh.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.686
Tell them we'll accept.

33:44.981 --> 33:48.401
Tonight,
we host the most special guest,

33:49.026 --> 33:50.236
our very creator.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.281
Now, as we welcome him,

33:53.364 --> 33:56.534
It's the peacock's feathers
that tell us the bird is strong.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.830
Now, others may speak
of high-ground and sight-lines,

34:00.913 --> 34:03.082
but we know the first line of defense.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.376
It's crisp collars.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.128
It's polished perfection.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.589
It's well-timed refills.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.884
Now, tonight of all nights,

34:13.593 --> 34:15.428
you go and make me proud.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.014
Go on, then.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.350
Hey, I need a minute.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.894
You seem a little wound up.

34:22.977 --> 34:25.897
The Tailie who was assaulted?
It was Lights.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.523
-Is she okay?
No.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.691
They maimed her hand.

34:29.358 --> 34:32.570
Multiple assailants, no witnesses.
Seems like it was organized.

34:32.653 --> 34:36.032
Organized? She's been on the job
three hours, already got a conspiracy.

34:36.115 --> 34:38.326
-You gave me the job, let me do it.
It's your case.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.204
What's your gut tell you?

34:41.788 --> 34:43.414
My gut? Okay.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.376
Could be just Tail prejudice,

34:47.960 --> 34:50.838
but someone's trying to stir up trouble
while we're vulnerable.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.300
What if Wilford's already here?

35:01.891 --> 35:02.892
Can I join you?

35:04.602 --> 35:05.436
You good?

35:06.020 --> 35:07.647
I'm fine.
Yeah?

35:11.651 --> 35:12.610
Show me.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.659
I'm calling it a tie.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.285
I'm gonna beat you one day.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.871
-You're gonna age out.
-Not this day.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.251
Icy Bob will have your back. Sykes, too.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.294
I know.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.131
Layton's just a blip.

35:33.214 --> 35:36.008
It's me they thank
when their heads hit the pillow at night.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.426
But having me do it?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.180
That's just about
punishing Melanie, right?

35:41.264 --> 35:42.682
We're telling a story, Alex.

35:43.349 --> 35:46.227
She takes the train from me,
he takes it from her.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.729
And now you, her own daughter,

35:49.814 --> 35:51.357
makes things right.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.904
It's a thick soup.

36:01.534 --> 36:05.746
You have come
so much further than her at your age.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.500
I can't wait for you to see it up there.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.294
Yeah.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.004
It'll take your breath away.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.423
And you'll take the helm.

36:16.841 --> 36:17.800
But...

36:20.011 --> 36:21.345
it won't be like Kevin.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.598
It'll get messy.

36:25.766 --> 36:28.603
<i>A part of you will... question it.</i>

36:28.686 --> 36:29.520
<i>The pangs...</i>

36:31.731 --> 36:33.399
<i>you have to blot them out.</i>

36:34.734 --> 36:37.236
I know how strong you are, Josie.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.532
People always
look to you for the right thing to do.

36:42.116 --> 36:44.452
I have a path again, Josie.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.752
Don't try
to take it away from me.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.559
On behalf of <i>Snowpiercer,</i>

37:09.477 --> 37:10.561
welcome aboard, sir.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.979
Thank you.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.524
It's such a pleasure
to see the teal worn with such pride.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.735
We do our best, sir.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.862
Apologies, sir.
We're gonna have to search you.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.447
Of course you do, Roche.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.366
I wouldn't expect anything less.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.953
Arms up, please. Thank you.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.707
Okay. This way, please.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.926
Wilford! Wilford!

37:42.843 --> 37:45.888
Hello. How lovely to see you.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.808
I love what you've done with the place.
It's absolutely amazing.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.018
Justice!

37:54.522 --> 37:57.108
Hello. Oh, cheer up.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.860
Hello. How are you?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.780
Good to see you. So nice to see you.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.949
Mr. Wilford. Mr. Wilford!

38:05.032 --> 38:07.243
Oh, let her through. Come, child.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.663
-Why do you look familiar?
-I'm LJ Folger.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.581
So you are.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.377
How are Robert and Lilah?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.796
Uh, they died in the war.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.966
You have my deepest condolences.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.724
Come on.
-You still have friends up here.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.267
Hey, keep your mouth shut!

38:31.350 --> 38:32.518
Okay, Mr. Wilford.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.854
Let's keep it moving,
the subtrain is waiting.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.150
Hello, there.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.653
Hello, there. Hi. Hello.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.530
Ladies and gentlemen...

38:46.949 --> 38:48.826
-Mr. Wilford.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.620
Thank you. Thank you very much.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.831
Thank you very much.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.500
-Table for eight, please.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.295
Hello.

39:00.463 --> 39:04.175
I will confess,
this relationship confuses me.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.594
I thought you overthrew her.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.138
We've had our moments.

39:09.221 --> 39:12.808
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of <i>Snowpiercer,</i>

39:12.892 --> 39:15.936
I would like to welcome
Mr. Wilford and his crew aboard.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.400
Thank you.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.652
Thank you, Mr. Layton.

39:24.236 --> 39:27.823
I look forward to, uh, the Aquarium,
First Class Dining...

39:27.907 --> 39:28.949
My Nightcar!

39:29.033 --> 39:30.785
I'm afraid
we have graver

39:30.868 --> 39:32.745
concerns to address today, Mr. Wilford.

39:32.828 --> 39:33.704
Of course.

39:33.788 --> 39:37.750
Concerns that must be
addressed together, as one train.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.211
Head Engineer Cavill.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.254
Thank you.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.552
People of <i>Snowpiercer</i> and <i>Big Alice,</i>

39:49.887 --> 39:50.971
the Earth is warming.

39:52.848 --> 39:56.227
CW-7 in the upper atmosphere
is dissipating.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.647
Instead of a 1,000-year timeframe,

40:00.439 --> 40:04.110
the planet may create warm spots
that could support recolonization

40:05.069 --> 40:07.071
in <i>our</i> lifetimes.

40:10.616 --> 40:11.492
Now...

40:13.035 --> 40:14.245
we have a lot to learn.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.664
A lot to prepare for.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.041
And we have to do it together.

40:19.959 --> 40:23.963
First, we need to boot up
the Breslauer Research Station

40:24.046 --> 40:25.047
in the Rocky Mountains.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.757
Uh, we just traveled that line.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.718
It's not fit for <i>Snowpiercer,</i>
she'd never make it through.

40:30.344 --> 40:34.974
Second, we need to release a network
of sounding balloons across the continent,

40:35.057 --> 40:37.685
into Asia,
as far as the Himalayan Terminus.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.771
The balloons
will relay data to the research station,

40:40.855 --> 40:44.692
and <i>Snowpiercer</i> will return
in a month's time to collect it.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.486
At which point,

40:47.570 --> 40:50.448
we hope to have found
what we're looking for.

40:51.198 --> 40:52.533
An "X" on the map

40:53.576 --> 40:56.704
where life... can begin again.

41:00.166 --> 41:03.210
How are we to believe any of this?

41:03.294 --> 41:07.798
This is the woman
who pretended to be me for seven years!

41:08.466 --> 41:10.176
There's no lie too audacious for her.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.260
She's not lying.

41:11.343 --> 41:14.221
And here's the blood-soaked stowaway
to back her up.

41:14.305 --> 41:18.184
How comforting for you all,
a thief and a rebel.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.895
Uh, Mr. Wilford, sir...
Yes?

41:20.978 --> 41:24.064
Yeah, the CW-7...
Well, not to contradict you, sir.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.024
Just say it!

41:25.107 --> 41:28.611
Uh, the CW-7, it may have
been buried in a larger compound.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.154
Ammonium sulfate.

41:30.237 --> 41:33.282
And if that's what it was,
and in the quantities we saw--

41:33.365 --> 41:36.035
The theory holds, sir.

41:37.703 --> 41:40.581
So, what do you say, Mr. Wilford?

41:41.332 --> 41:43.500
Should we recolonize Earth, or nah?

41:45.628 --> 41:49.507
All right. To get the research station
online, it'll need to be manned.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.050
That's right.

41:51.133 --> 41:54.428
Someone out there for a month.
Someone who knows the station.

41:54.511 --> 41:56.555
Someone who knows the science.

41:57.556 --> 42:00.518
Someone with... breach experience.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.520
Yes.

42:04.146 --> 42:06.315
You really should've
led with that, Melanie.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.192
For this to work,

42:08.984 --> 42:10.236
it has to be you.

42:10.819 --> 42:11.779
What?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.405
I'm sure our Head Engineer

42:13.489 --> 42:16.283
isn't the only scientist
who can man this station.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.495
Oh, but she is, Mr. Layton.
Aren't you, Melanie?

42:20.162 --> 42:22.998
Your brilliance is exactly why we're here.

42:24.750 --> 42:27.586
It's just unfortunate that your projects

42:27.670 --> 42:30.548
always seem to require
leaving someone behind.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.385
Your turn, Melanie.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.054
Your turn.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.473
Those are my terms.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.688
All hostilities cease.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.065
Those are my terms.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.818
The trains have to work together.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.031
I want nothing more.

42:56.115 --> 42:58.659
Then I'll send an inventory
of equipment that I need.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.412
The future...

43:02.830 --> 43:03.956
is outside!

43:08.919 --> 43:09.795
No.

43:09.878 --> 43:11.797
Let's go find a new Eden!

43:14.300 --> 43:18.554
And so begins
a new era of peace and cooperation!

43:18.637 --> 43:22.349
One train bound by common cause!

43:23.642 --> 43:25.185
Oh, no, no, no.

43:28.230 --> 43:29.523
-Well, that worked.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.860
He's right, it should be me.

43:33.819 --> 43:34.945
Could have let me know.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.780
Just keep the train in one piece, huh?

43:38.991 --> 43:39.992
Come back to get me.

43:42.703 --> 43:43.746
Better go shake his hand.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.757
Lights.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.594
Hey, I need you to show me your hand.

44:00.512 --> 44:01.722
Please. I gotta see it.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.736
Oh!

44:26.538 --> 44:39.218
Wilford!

-Thank you.

Hey!

46:28.744 --> 46:30.662
Don't you dare say this is for me.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.165
It's for all of us.

46:34.374 --> 46:35.584
It's hope.
