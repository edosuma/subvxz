that your mother has a
whole tureen of goat biryani.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.453
I know, right?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.756
Those gourmet
cooking classes are
sure coming in handy.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.823
(HONKING)

09:18.825 --> 09:21.293
(CANDACE GIGGLING
IN EXCITEMENT)

09:24.130 --> 09:25.697
Hey, wait for me, guys!

09:25.699 --> 09:28.366
Whoa!
The Chupacabra's gone!

09:28.368 --> 09:31.136
This must be
how Candace feels
when this happens.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.771
You know,
I've had it with you,
Perry the Platypus.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.774
You never,
never let me
have the last...

09:35.776 --> 09:40.745
(SCREAMING)
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

09:41.347 --> 09:42.346
(BEEPING)

09:42.348 --> 09:46.751
<i>Agent P, we've just heard</i>
<i>that our New Mexico</i>
<i>operative, Agent C.H.,</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:48.420
<i>has had his cover</i>
<i>compromised!</i>

09:48.422 --> 09:50.155
We have the coordinates
of his location,

09:50.157 --> 09:52.724
and you are
the closest agent.
Get to it!

09:52.726 --> 09:54.125
CARL: Keep writing, sir.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.231
(CANDACE STILL GIGGLING)

10:00.233 --> 10:01.766
Mom, you won't
believe this.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.766
Now, Candace,

10:02.768 --> 10:05.503
why would you ever
give me reason
not to believe you?

10:05.505 --> 10:08.173
What if I told you
that Phineas
and Ferb captured

10:08.175 --> 10:09.874
an actual
Chupacabra?

10:09.876 --> 10:12.844
Well, that would test my
suspension of disbelief.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.747
Well, disbelief
no more!

10:15.749 --> 10:17.816
'Cause I got it
right here.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.317
And it's not
going anywhere.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.585
Right.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.821
Oh, ye of
excessive sarcasm,

10:22.823 --> 10:27.225
I present to you
the elusive Chupacabra.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.860
(IN MOCK DISBELIEF)
I don't believe it.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.829
Hey! How did I
get into that crate?

10:30.831 --> 10:32.731
Well, I'm at least glad
to see you kids

10:32.733 --> 10:34.666
are going to finish up
my leftover biryani.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.800
Yes, ma'am!

10:35.802 --> 10:37.569
But... But... But...

10:40.740 --> 10:42.574
I don't get it.
He usually shows up
by now.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.708
Oh, there you are, Perry.

10:44.677 --> 10:45.676
You'll never believe this,

10:45.678 --> 10:49.648
but for a while there,
we had a real-live
Chupacabra.

10:49.650 --> 10:50.915
Here, we took
pictures.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.593
Next. Next. Next. Next.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.862
Well, I guess perhaps
the universe wants
some things

11:03.864 --> 11:05.263
left unphotographed,

11:05.265 --> 11:06.698
like Chupacabras,

11:06.700 --> 11:09.467
or group photos
where everyone
has their eyes open.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.302
