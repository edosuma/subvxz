00:58.258 --> 01:02.558
Jimmy? Come on.
You're serving today.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.729
Christine?
Where's my pants?

01:06.866 --> 01:10.302
On the bed.
If they had teeth they would've bit you.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.692
Jimmy! Go to the store,
buy me the newspaper and cigarettes.

01:33.793 --> 01:37.007
Can't. Serving mass.
I'm an altar boy.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.907
- Hey, Kevin!
- Hey, Jimmy!

02:23.176 --> 02:25.770
- There you are.
- Overslept.

02:25.912 --> 02:29.973
Well, you made it. I'll do the cruets
if you light the charcoal.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.479
You think I'm fat?

02:35.021 --> 02:37.717
You're all right. What?
Clothes don't fit?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.314
No, they fit.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.733
You're gonna be going to the bakery
after mass.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.901
I am? Why don't you go?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.104
I'm gonna be making breakfast.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.271
I can make breakfast.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.042
When have you ever?

03:03.149 --> 03:04.810
Funny man.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.118
Good morning, Connie.
- Good morning.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.796
<i>Holy God, we praise thy name</i>

03:27.907 --> 03:29.772
Good morning, Father.

03:31.644 --> 03:37.879
<i>Lord of all, we bow before thee</i>

03:38.318 --> 03:44.621
<i>All on Earth thy scepter claim</i>

03:44.824 --> 03:51.286
<i>All in heaven above adore thee</i>

03:53.132 --> 03:57.398
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

03:57.837 --> 04:03.537
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

04:04.544 --> 04:09.880
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

04:10.850 --> 04:17.721
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

04:22.095 --> 04:23.426
<i>Be seated.</i>

04:37.243 --> 04:39.871
<i>What do you do when
you're not sure?</i>

04:42.115 --> 04:44.709
<i>That's the topic
of my sermon today.</i>

04:46.586 --> 04:49.919
<i>Last year when</i>
<i>President Kennedy was assassinated,</i>

04:50.757 --> 04:55.217
<i>who among us did not experience</i>
<i>the most profound disorientation?</i>

04:55.328 --> 04:56.625
<i>Despair?</i>

04:57.930 --> 05:01.422
<i>Which way? What now?</i>

05:03.403 --> 05:07.305
<i>What do I say to my kids?</i>
<i>What do I tell myself?</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:11.736
<i>It was a time of people
sitting together,</i>

05:11.844 --> 05:16.110
<i>bound together by a common
feeling of hopelessness.</i>

05:18.251 --> 05:19.946
<i>But think of that.</i>

05:21.788 --> 05:26.589
<i>Your bond with your fellow being</i>
<i>was your despair.</i>

05:28.795 --> 05:32.492
<i>It was a public experience.</i>
<i>It was awful,</i>

05:32.632 --> 05:34.566
<i>but we were in it together.</i>

05:36.202 --> 05:42.766
<i>How much worse is it then</i>
<i>for the lone man, the lone woman,</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:46.444
<i>stricken by a private calamity?</i>

05:47.547 --> 05:53.782
<i>"No one knows I'm sick. " "No one</i>
<i>knows I've lost my last real friend. "</i>

05:56.489 --> 05:59.356
<i>"No one knows</i>
<i>I've done something wrong. "</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:02.294
<i>Imagine the isolation.</i>

06:03.730 --> 06:06.858
<i>Now you see the world</i>
<i>as through a window.</i>

06:06.999 --> 06:10.162
<i>On one side of the glass,</i>
<i>happy untroubled people,</i>

06:10.303 --> 06:12.863
<i>and on the other side, you.</i>

06:14.807 --> 06:17.332
- God bless you, Sister.
- Thank you.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.103
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

06:22.749 --> 06:27.846
<i>A cargo ship sank one night.</i>
<i>It caught fire and went down,</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:31.580
<i>and only this one sailor survived.</i>

06:32.892 --> 06:36.089
<i>He found a lifeboat,
rigged a sail,</i>

06:36.195 --> 06:37.662
<i>and being of a nautical discipline</i>

06:37.797 --> 06:41.631
<i>turned his eyes to the heavens</i>
<i>and read the stars.</i>

06:41.734 --> 06:45.761
<i>He set a course for his home,</i>
<i>and, exhausted, fell asleep.</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:47.664
Just keeps going on.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.468
<i>Clouds rolled in,</i>

06:50.576 --> 06:56.640
<i>and for the next 20 nights,</i>
<i>he could no longer see the stars.</i>

06:58.184 --> 07:02.314
<i>He thought he was on course,</i>
<i>but there was no way to be certain.</i>

07:03.756 --> 07:07.954
<i>And as the days rolled on,</i>
<i>and the sailor wasted away,</i>

07:10.029 --> 07:12.293
<i>he began to have doubts.</i>

07:13.065 --> 07:17.229
- He just keeps on going.
- <i>Had he set his course right?</i>

07:17.370 --> 07:20.828
<i>Was he still going on</i>
<i>towards his home?</i>

07:20.940 --> 07:26.845
<i>Or was he horribly lost</i>
<i>and doomed to a terrible death?</i>

07:28.848 --> 07:30.406
<i>No way to know.</i>

07:31.350 --> 07:34.683
<i>The message of the constellations,</i>

07:34.787 --> 07:39.486
<i>had he imagined it because</i>
<i>of his desperate circumstance?</i>

07:39.592 --> 07:43.528
- <i>Or had he seen truth once...</i>
- Straighten up!

07:43.629 --> 07:48.726
<i>... and now had to hold on to it</i>
<i>without further reassurance?</i>

07:50.703 --> 07:53.399
<i>There are those of
you in church today</i>

07:53.539 --> 07:56.770
<i>who know exactly</i>
<i>the crisis of faith I describe,</i>

07:58.578 --> 08:00.671
<i>and I wanna say to you,</i>

08:02.748 --> 08:08.584
<i>doubt can be a bond as powerful</i>
<i>and sustaining as certainty.</i>

08:11.557 --> 08:15.755
<i>When you are lost,
you are not alone.</i>

08:21.734 --> 08:25.135
<i>In the name of the Father,</i>
<i>the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

08:27.974 --> 08:29.407
<i>Please rise.</i>

08:31.744 --> 08:37.443
<i>Praise God,</i>
<i>from whom all blessings flow</i>

08:37.783 --> 08:41.979
<i>Praise him all creatures here...</i>

08:53.833 --> 08:57.132
- Hey, Father.
- Hey, champ.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.669
That was some sermon.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.605
Did it mean something to you?

09:05.478 --> 09:08.345
I wanna do that. I wanna be a priest.

09:10.283 --> 09:14.481
You'd be a good one, I'm sure. Here.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.084
Take a look.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.161
See?

09:32.672 --> 09:37.166
- She's dancing. Kind of neat?
- Yeah.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.868
Here. You try.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.484
That's for you. Take it.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.856
- Thank you, Father.
- Welcome.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.440
Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.140
Maryanne said it.
- Let's do it together.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.444
Okay.
- Yeah. It's true.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.986
And did I tell you that Jessica's
having a sleepover on Saturday?

11:29.088 --> 11:30.919
Morning, Sister James.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.752
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.292
Not too bad.
How're the criminals doing today?

11:35.428 --> 11:38.090
- Not bad, Father.
- Good, Father.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.961
- Morning, champ.
- Morning, Father Flynn.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.897
You wash those hands today,
Mr. London?

11:43.002 --> 11:44.731
I washed them, Father.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.862
I don't know. They're a different color
than your neck.

11:49.108 --> 11:51.508
Morning.
- Morning, Father Flynn.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.576
- Sister, are we having the test today?
- Get in line.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.238
Tomorrow, William.

11:56.348 --> 11:58.578
- Is it long division?
- Among other things.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.346
Sister.
- Good morning, Sister.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.479
- How much of it will be long division?
- Boy!

12:06.025 --> 12:09.324
William London. Come up here.

12:12.131 --> 12:18.969
Come smartly, now.
Don't make me wait.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.971
What did he do?
- He touched Sister James.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.704
The dragon is hungry.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.711
You don't touch a nun.

12:37.590 --> 12:42.027
Take out your history books, please.
Turn to page 683.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.394
- Yes, Ralph.
- I forgot my history book.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.798
You can look on with Raymond.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.696
Mr. London?

12:54.840 --> 12:57.809
- Do you have your history book?
- No, Sister.

12:57.910 --> 13:02.176
- Share with Mr. Malloy, please.
- Do I have to? His breath stinks!

13:06.919 --> 13:10.252
I'm sure Mr. Malloy's
breath is just fine.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.524
Be seated.

13:19.865 --> 13:24.234
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the
32nd president of the United States.

13:24.370 --> 13:28.170
That barrette out of your hair,
Miss Horan.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.707
Yes, Sister.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.544
Morning, Sister James.
Continue.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.004
Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with

13:36.115 --> 13:39.209
Abraham Lincoln
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

13:39.318 --> 13:42.617
was perhaps our greatest president.
When he assumed office,

13:42.755 --> 13:45.781
13 million people in this country
were unemployed.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.358
They'd lost hope,

13:47.459 --> 13:49.552
and President Roosevelt
said to these people,

13:49.662 --> 13:53.894
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself."

13:55.100 --> 13:58.467
What did he mean by that? James?

14:00.139 --> 14:02.130
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing really wrong.

14:02.274 --> 14:06.711
- You know? So don't get so emotional.
- Maybe.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.804
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good

14:09.949 --> 14:12.645
and we need only work together
to overcome our problems.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.776
What's this, Mr. Conroy?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.887
I don't know, Sister.

14:21.327 --> 14:25.627
You don't know you have a wire
coming out of your ear?

14:25.764 --> 14:26.822
- No.
- Huh?

14:28.534 --> 14:29.796
Huh?

14:30.502 --> 14:32.333
No, Sister. I didn't.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.806
You come with me, boy.

14:45.851 --> 14:46.909
Go.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.987
Who knows what the New Deal was?

14:57.830 --> 15:01.391
<i>The first noel</i>

15:01.500 --> 15:04.867
<i>The angels did say</i>

15:04.970 --> 15:10.602
<i>Was to certain poor shepherds</i>
<i>in fields as they lay</i>

15:10.709 --> 15:12.438
I love this song.

15:12.611 --> 15:18.516
<i>In fields where they lay</i>
<i>keeping their sheep</i>

15:18.951 --> 15:25.356
<i>On a cold winter's night</i>
<i>that was so deep</i>

16:38.464 --> 16:44.562
This past Sunday, what do you think
that sermon was about? Sister James?

16:45.237 --> 16:46.204
Huh?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.600
What was
Father Flynn's sermon about?

16:52.077 --> 16:56.707
Well, doubt.
He was talking about doubt.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.244
- Why?
- Excuse me, Sister?

17:02.354 --> 17:05.448
Well, sermons come from somewhere,
don't they?

17:05.590 --> 17:07.820
Is Father Flynn in doubt?

17:07.960 --> 17:11.088
Is he concerned
that someone else is in doubt?

17:12.097 --> 17:13.655
I suppose you'd have to ask him.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.892
No, that would not be appropriate.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.468
He is my superior,

17:17.603 --> 17:20.435
and if he were troubled
he should confess it to a fellow priest

17:20.539 --> 17:22.233
or to the monsignor.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.935
We do not share
intimate information with priests.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.944
- No.
- That's true.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.844
What are we saying?

17:32.785 --> 17:35.276
I want you all to be alert.

17:35.387 --> 17:42.293
I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about matters in St. Nicholas School.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.432
Academically?

17:50.469 --> 17:53.836
I was not inviting a guessing game,
Sister Raymond.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.770
Missy! Get away from her,
and sit down.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.973
- May I join you, Sister Aloysius?
- Yes.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.987
- Chicken chow mein.
- Sister Veronica's favorite.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.151
It's very good.

19:22.261 --> 19:25.424
I like the noodles. I like the crunch.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.000
- What happened to William London?
- I sent him home.

19:32.104 --> 19:36.165
- Oh, dear. So he's still bleeding?
- Yes.

19:37.276 --> 19:38.334
His nose just let loose

19:38.443 --> 19:40.911
and started gushing
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

19:41.046 --> 19:42.570
Was it spontaneous?

19:42.714 --> 19:44.875
- What?
- His nosebleed.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.884
- What else would it be?
- Self-induced.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.012
Mmm-hmm.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.215
You mean you think

19:52.324 --> 19:55.623
he might have intentionally
given himself a nosebleed?

19:55.761 --> 19:57.023
Exactly.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.355
No.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.293
You are a very innocent person,
Sister James.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.239
William London is a fidgety boy.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.639
If you do not keep right on him,
he will do anything to escape his chair.

20:11.777 --> 20:16.043
He would set his foot on fire
for half a day out of school.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.709
Here. Sister, allow me to help you.
Your sleeve.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.679
Uh-oh.

20:23.288 --> 20:26.121
- Let's see.
- Oh, thank you, Sister.

20:29.294 --> 20:33.253
- Sister Veronica is going blind.
- Oh, how horrible.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.663
If they find out in the rectory,
she'll be gone.

20:35.801 --> 20:39.066
So if she looks unsteady,
take her hand.

20:40.672 --> 20:46.668
Ordinarily I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth grade,

20:47.613 --> 20:51.140
but I am working within constraints.

20:53.318 --> 20:57.186
- Are you in control of your class?
- I think so.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.157
Usually more students
are sent down to me.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.921
I try to take care of things myself.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.021
That can be an error.

21:07.165 --> 21:10.498
You are answerable to me,
I to the monsignor,

21:10.636 --> 21:13.264
he to the bishop,
and so on up to the Holy Father.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.932
There is a chain. Make use of it.

21:18.343 --> 21:19.503
Candy?

21:20.245 --> 21:21.507
Cough drops.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.945
Candy by another name.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.319
How is Donald Miller doing?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.615
- Steady.
- Good.

21:32.491 --> 21:35.892
That girl, Noreen Horan.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.054
I've seated her
as far away from the boys as possible.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.529
- Doesn't do much good.
- Mmm.

21:41.933 --> 21:45.892
Just get her through intact.

21:50.342 --> 21:51.809
What's this?

21:53.945 --> 21:59.577
The wind is so peripatetic this year.

22:01.453 --> 22:05.150
- Is that the word I want?
- Is something the matter?

22:06.925 --> 22:07.914
What?

22:08.060 --> 22:10.324
Is something the matter?
- No.

22:11.396 --> 22:16.265
- Why? Is something the matter?
- I don't think so.

22:16.401 --> 22:19.893
- Well, then, nothing's the matter then.
- Yes.

22:20.038 --> 22:22.905
- What's this?
- A pen.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.404
A ballpoint pen.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.777
The students are not using them
for assignments, I hope.

22:29.915 --> 22:30.939
No, of course not.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.280
I am sorry I allowed even
cartridge pens into this school.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.853
Always easy way out, these days.

22:38.223 --> 22:42.284
Every easy choice today
will have its consequence tomorrow.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.361
- Mark my words.
- Yes, Sister.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.363
Ballpoints make them press down.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.296
When they press down,
they write like monkeys.

22:48.433 --> 22:52.233
- I don't allow them ballpoint pens.
- And yet here one is.

22:54.272 --> 22:58.208
Penmanship is dying
all across this country.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.409
I hope not.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.415
You should frame something.

23:04.516 --> 23:08.782
Put it up on the blackboard.
Put the pope up.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.287
That's the wrong pope. He's deceased.

23:12.424 --> 23:17.157
I don't care what pope it is.
Use the glass to see behind you.

23:17.295 --> 23:21.391
Children should think you have eyes
in the back of your head.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.434
Wouldn't that be a little frightening?

23:23.535 --> 23:26.299
Only to the ones
who are up to no good.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.246
Relax. Put it up there.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.341
All right, now.

23:40.719 --> 23:44.587
The thing about shooting
from the foul line is it's psychological.

23:44.689 --> 23:47.453
All right, come up with a routine.

23:47.559 --> 23:50.392
You shift your weight, move your hips...

23:51.630 --> 23:52.892
Yeah, you think that's funny, Ralph?

23:52.998 --> 23:54.625
You know what's funny is
you never getting a foul shot.

23:56.001 --> 24:01.337
All right, concentrate on the routine,
and you'll forget to get tensed up.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.772
All right, go ahead, Jimmy.

24:10.081 --> 24:15.348
Good man. You listen. That's good.
All right, now sit down, everyone.

24:16.688 --> 24:17.848
Good.

24:18.757 --> 24:24.195
On another matter, I've noticed
several of you guys got dirty nails.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.890
All right, I don't want to see that.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.557
I'm not talking about
the length of your nails.

24:29.701 --> 24:32.135
I'm talking about cleanliness.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.205
See, look at my nails.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.575
- All right, they're long.
- Whoa!

24:41.246 --> 24:47.082
Yeah, I like them a little long,
but look at how clean they are.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.658
That makes it okay.

25:02.567 --> 25:06.765
The climpity-clomp.
Clomp-clomp-clomp.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.100
Harder than a herd of elephants.

25:13.945 --> 25:15.742
You are wicked!

25:15.881 --> 25:17.781
No, I told her, "You're her mother.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.044
"You raised her. You fed her.
You tell her she's fat."

25:21.786 --> 25:23.754
But wait, how fat is she?

25:23.889 --> 25:26.517
- What, the mother or the daughter?
- The daughter.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.887
I never met the daughter.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.257
- What about the mother?
- Fat.

26:24.282 --> 26:27.080
Father, we having practice
after school?

26:27.185 --> 26:30.450
If you guys want it, we can have it.
Let me know.

26:32.324 --> 26:36.522
The Fascist governments
of Germany and Italy

26:36.661 --> 26:38.993
were already working together.

26:39.698 --> 26:42.030
They formed the Pact of Steel.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.501
The Pact of Steel was...

26:44.636 --> 26:45.762
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:45.870 --> 26:50.671
...a military alliance between
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

26:50.809 --> 26:55.371
Mr. London, get back in your seat
and stop bothering Miss Horan, please.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.212
Now, who can tell me...

27:04.689 --> 27:05.986
Yes?

27:07.025 --> 27:09.016
Yes. Of course, Father.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.892
Donald? You should go to the rectory.

27:19.571 --> 27:25.407
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

27:25.510 --> 27:31.710
Go one, two, three, touch.
One, two, three, kick.

27:31.850 --> 27:37.015
And back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front. Again.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.214
<i> We began to dance</i>

27:39.724 --> 27:41.919
<i>Swaying to and fro</i>

27:43.361 --> 27:47.127
<i>And soon I knew</i>
<i>I'd never let him go</i>

27:48.066 --> 27:50.967
- Raymond, what are you doing?
- The mashed potato.

27:51.069 --> 27:53.196
You're supposed to be doing
the bossa nova.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.431
- But I know the mashed potato.
- Oh...

27:58.376 --> 28:03.143
All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick.

28:03.248 --> 28:08.151
Back, side... One, two, three, kick.

28:08.253 --> 28:13.088
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

28:15.393 --> 28:18.760
Let me get in front of you
so that you can see what I'm doing.

28:19.898 --> 28:22.696
And one, two, three, touch.

28:22.801 --> 28:25.861
One, two, three, kick.

28:25.970 --> 28:30.873
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

28:31.943 --> 28:36.505
Okay. This is really good.
Very good there.

28:36.614 --> 28:38.411
<i>Now I'm glad to say</i>

28:38.516 --> 28:40.416
<i>I'm his bride to be</i>

28:41.753 --> 28:46.656
<i>And we're gonna raise a family</i>

29:17.822 --> 29:20.950
Donald, are you feeling ill?
- No.

29:21.993 --> 29:24.655
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

29:26.464 --> 29:31.128
- Are you all right?
- I just want to go home.

29:52.056 --> 29:56.254
- Good afternoon, Sister.
- Good afternoon, Sister James.

29:56.361 --> 29:59.626
Sister, can I speak with you
about Donald Miller?

30:02.500 --> 30:05.833
Is he being accepted?
- He has no friends.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.701
That would be a lot
to expect after only two months.

30:11.342 --> 30:14.038
- Has anyone hit him?
- No.

30:15.413 --> 30:17.540
Someone will.

30:17.682 --> 30:23.678
And when that happens,
send them right down to me.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.551
I'm not so sure anyone will.

30:29.227 --> 30:32.162
This parish serves Irish
and Italian families.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.663
Someone will hit Donald Miller.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.964
He has a protector.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.728
Who?

30:45.877 --> 30:47.344
Father Flynn.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.011
What?

30:58.923 --> 31:00.891
He's taken an interest.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.736
I told you to come to me,
but I hoped you never would.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.409
Maybe I shouldn't have.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.386
So, it's happened.

31:30.989 --> 31:35.756
What? Oh, no. I'm not telling you that.
I'm not even certain what you mean.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.224
Oh, excuse me there, Sisters.

31:38.329 --> 31:41.196
No bother. We're done here.
Come, Sister.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.873
What have you seen?

31:55.513 --> 31:57.504
It is unsettling
to look at people with suspicion.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.207
I feel less close to God.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.410
When you take a step
to address wrongdoing,

32:01.552 --> 32:05.784
you are taking a step away from God,
but in his service.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.388
What have you seen?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.123
Good afternoon, Sisters.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.959
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson.
Why the cat?

32:15.099 --> 32:17.693
'Cause there's a mouse.
Want some tea?

32:18.269 --> 32:20.703
If you don't want to dance with her,
don't dance with her.

32:20.805 --> 32:22.796
- Well, is it wrong?
- No.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.500
But what if the girl turns you down?

32:28.646 --> 32:31.740
All right, you have the right
to ask a girl to dance.

32:31.849 --> 32:34.579
All right,
she has the right to turn you down.

32:34.686 --> 32:38.122
The trick is, don't take it to heart.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.588
What if they all turn you down?

32:41.492 --> 32:43.050
Well, then you become a priest.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.225
All right, next question.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.475
What have you seen?

33:07.151 --> 33:10.143
He called Donald Miller to the rectory.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.949
- What for?
- A talk.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.114
- Alone?
- Yes.

33:13.224 --> 33:16.193
- When?
- A week ago during class.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.919
Why didn't you tell me?

33:18.029 --> 33:21.260
I didn't think
there was anything wrong with it.

33:26.971 --> 33:29.531
Of all the children, Donald Miller.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.707
I suppose it makes sense.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.972
- How does it make sense?
- He's isolated.

33:36.080 --> 33:40.210
- I don't know that anything is wrong.
- Our first Negro student.

33:41.486 --> 33:44.717
I thought there would be fighting.
Thought we...

33:46.224 --> 33:48.624
A parent or two to deal with.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.227
I should have foreseen this possibility.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.524
How could you imagine it?

33:56.667 --> 34:00.364
Well, it's my job
to outshine the fox in cleverness.

34:04.909 --> 34:07.810
- That is my job.
- But maybe it's nothing.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.246
Then why do you look like
you've seen the devil?

34:20.091 --> 34:22.355
It's just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.428
- He said something?
- No, it was his expression.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.393
He looked frightened.

34:26.531 --> 34:30.831
And he put his head on the desk
in the most peculiar way, and...

34:33.137 --> 34:38.040
And one other thing,
I think there was alcohol on his breath.

34:43.447 --> 34:47.407
There was alcohol on his breath.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.764
Years ago at Saint Boniface
there was a priest.

35:11.943 --> 35:16.073
But I had Father Scully then.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.443
Here, there's no man I can go to.
Men run everything.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.583
We are going to have to
stop him ourselves.

35:30.261 --> 35:33.458
There we go. She got him. Takes a cat.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.391
Yes, it does.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.133
Yes, it does.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.148
This towel
will never be dead white again.

36:29.253 --> 36:30.618
Yes, it will.

36:30.721 --> 36:33.155
Mrs. Carson.
- I'm fine.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.285
- What happened?
- There's a branch down.

36:36.394 --> 36:38.259
- Are you all right, Sister?
- She didn't see it.

36:38.362 --> 36:42.458
Fine. Just bushwhacked.
No need for a fuss.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.501
You just go lie down.
I'll bring you some tea.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.433
Come with me.
- I just...

36:46.537 --> 36:49.370
I'll get you a compress.
- I did not fail to see it.

36:50.107 --> 36:52.132
- <i>Hello? Yes, Sister.</i>
- Mr. McGuinn.

36:52.243 --> 36:55.235
Could you look in on the courtyard?
I've got branches falling.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.506
- <i>What has?</i>
- A branch has!

37:01.886 --> 37:06.755
Watch your step here, Sister.
I'll cut it up.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.485
The world is crashing, Michael.

37:11.596 --> 37:14.895
I haven't heard a wind like that
since I left Mullingar.

37:15.032 --> 37:18.559
I've never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.

37:41.726 --> 37:44.286
What are you doing out here, Conroy?

37:45.329 --> 37:47.422
I talked in class, Father.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.908
Waiting for Sister Aloysius.

38:05.416 --> 38:08.579
- She know you're here?
- She knows.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.148
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Good of you to come by.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.226
Morning, Sister Aloysius.
How are you today?

38:16.327 --> 38:17.453
I'm very well, thank you.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.654
- Mr. Conroy.
- Yes, Sister.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.697
Mr. Transistor Radio.

38:23.367 --> 38:25.597
Multiplication table, 10 times,
in its totality,

38:25.703 --> 38:27.500
delivered to me tomorrow morning.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.935
Legible, boy.

38:30.474 --> 38:34.069
Return to class. Go. Go, go.

38:44.789 --> 38:48.247
I'd invite you in,
but we're just short Sister James.

38:54.965 --> 38:57.991
- Hear that wind last night?
- I certainly did.

39:00.871 --> 39:01.838
Oh.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.936
Did I hear
Sister Veronica had an accident?

39:04.041 --> 39:07.602
Yeah. Sister Veronica fell,
practically killed herself.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.146
- Is she all right?
- Oh, she's fine.

39:12.883 --> 39:17.343
- Her sight isn't good, is it?
- Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you know.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.483
Nah, I didn't know that.

39:20.591 --> 39:24.118
It's the habit.
It catches us up more often than not.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.285
Hmm.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.422
We go down like dominoes.

39:29.767 --> 39:32.201
- Am I past the time?
- Not at all.

39:32.336 --> 39:33.860
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Sister.

39:34.004 --> 39:36.131
I'm sorry I was delayed.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.970
- I ran into Sister Veronica.
- How is she?

39:39.076 --> 39:41.806
I'm afraid
she has a bit of a bloody nose.

39:41.912 --> 39:45.006
I'm beginning to think
you're punching people.

39:46.517 --> 39:47.745
Sister?

39:47.885 --> 39:50.683
First, William London and now...

39:53.023 --> 39:57.892
- Never mind. Well, come in, please.
- Sister.

40:00.097 --> 40:03.931
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.831
I actually have a hot pot of tea.

40:05.936 --> 40:09.997
And close this,
but not quite for form's sake.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.241
Father, would you care for a...

40:15.312 --> 40:19.373
- Would you have a cup of tea, Father?
- I'd love a cup of tea.

40:19.483 --> 40:22.111
- Sister, perhaps you could serve him.
- I'd be glad.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.550
And yourself, of course.

40:23.654 --> 40:24.848
Would you like a cup of tea,
Sister Aloysius?

40:24.955 --> 40:26.684
No, I've already had my cup.

40:26.791 --> 40:30.249
- Is there sugar?
- Sugar?

40:32.430 --> 40:38.926
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

40:40.638 --> 40:44.904
I put it in the drawer for Lent last year.
Never remembered to take it out.

40:45.009 --> 40:46.977
It mustn't have been much
to give up, then.

40:49.647 --> 40:52.548
I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.

40:52.650 --> 40:59.249
I'll serve you, although
for want of practice I'm a little clumsy.

41:01.158 --> 41:05.959
- I see your fingernails.
- Wear them a little long.

41:07.665 --> 41:09.326
- The sugar?
- Yes. One?

41:09.467 --> 41:10.627
Three.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.569
- Three?
- Sweet tooth.

41:14.104 --> 41:17.096
Two. Three.

41:18.209 --> 41:21.303
- Sister, you care for sugar?
- Never.

41:21.445 --> 41:24.414
Not that there's
anything wrong with sugar.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.648
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.

41:28.786 --> 41:30.447
We are at our wit's end.

41:30.554 --> 41:34.650
I think it's an excellent idea
to rethink the Christmas pageant,

41:34.792 --> 41:37.852
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.

41:37.995 --> 41:41.829
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.

41:41.966 --> 41:45.333
<i>O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come,</i>
<i>O Come, Emmanuel, O Come...</i>

41:45.469 --> 41:47.767
All right.
Thank you, Sister James.

41:47.872 --> 41:48.930
So what do you think, Father?

41:49.039 --> 41:51.405
Is there something new we could do?

41:51.509 --> 41:53.977
Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,

41:54.078 --> 41:57.775
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.112
- Secular?
- Yes.

42:00.217 --> 42:03.311
<i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot</i>
<i>Like Christmas.</i> Something like that.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.981
What would be
the point of a secular song?

42:07.091 --> 42:08.285
Just fun.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.485
- Or <i>Frosty the Snowman.</i>
- That's a good one.

42:10.594 --> 42:14.860
We could have one of the boys
dress up as a snowman, dance around.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.030
Which boy?

42:21.071 --> 42:22.561
We'd do tryouts.

42:22.706 --> 42:27.234
<i>Frosty the Snowman</i>
espouses a pagan belief in magic.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.337
The snowman comes to life when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.

42:31.448 --> 42:32.915
If the music were more somber,

42:33.050 --> 42:38.181
people would realize the images
are disturbing and the song heretical.

42:38.289 --> 42:41.656
I never thought about
<i>Frosty the Snowman</i> like that.

42:41.759 --> 42:42.885
It should be banned from the airwaves.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.222
So, not <i>Frosty the Snowman.</i>

42:45.329 --> 42:51.234
Oh, <i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like</i>
<i>Christmas</i> would be fine, I suppose.

42:51.368 --> 42:53.268
Parents would like it.

42:55.205 --> 42:59.539
May I ask what you're writing down
with that ballpoint pen?

42:59.643 --> 43:03.010
Oh, nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.

43:03.447 --> 43:07.076
- Oh. You had one right now?
- I get them all the time.

43:07.484 --> 43:08.951
How fortunate.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.452
I forget them,
so I have to write them down.

43:11.555 --> 43:12.522
Oh.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.751
What is the idea?

43:16.927 --> 43:18.360
Intolerance.

43:24.301 --> 43:25.700
Would you like
a little more tea, Father?

43:25.803 --> 43:27.100
Not yet.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.930
It's a new time, Sister.

43:31.075 --> 43:34.238
- What's new about it?
- Something inside of people is new.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.905
There is nothing new under the sun.

43:40.084 --> 43:42.245
The Church needs to change.

43:43.153 --> 43:46.088
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,

43:46.190 --> 43:47.885
take the kids out for ice cream.

43:47.992 --> 43:49.152
Sweet tooth.

43:49.293 --> 43:52.262
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.

43:52.363 --> 43:53.990
The point being?

43:55.332 --> 43:57.323
We should be friendlier.

43:58.002 --> 43:59.936
You know, the children and the parents

44:00.037 --> 44:02.267
should see us
as members of their family.

44:02.373 --> 44:07.106
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.

44:07.778 --> 44:12.181
- Why? Because of our vows?
- Precisely.

44:13.617 --> 44:15.915
I don't think we're so different.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.749
You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.

44:17.855 --> 44:20.915
And they think we're different, yeah?

44:21.025 --> 44:22.617
The working...

44:22.726 --> 44:28.187
The working class people of this parish
trust us to be different.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.799
I think we're getting off the subject.

44:29.900 --> 44:31.561
Yes, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Back to it.

44:38.876 --> 44:40.173
Yes?

44:40.310 --> 44:42.437
Sister Raymond? Mmm.

44:44.181 --> 44:48.174
Well, you tell her to wash her face
and her neck and report to me at 3:00.

44:48.318 --> 44:49.444
Yeah.

44:51.288 --> 44:54.689
Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.

44:55.793 --> 44:57.818
We must be careful

44:57.928 --> 44:59.418
how Donald Miller is used
in the pageant.

44:59.530 --> 45:02.693
- Easy there, Sister.
- Father.

45:08.472 --> 45:10.303
All right, what about Donald Miller?

45:10.407 --> 45:12.602
We must be careful, in the pageant,

45:12.710 --> 45:16.703
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.

45:20.084 --> 45:23.383
- Because of the color of his skin?
- That's right, yeah.

45:23.520 --> 45:27.047
- Why?
- Oh, come, Father.

45:27.191 --> 45:30.490
I think he should be treated
like every other boy.

45:31.562 --> 45:35.794
Well, you yourself singled the boy out
for special attention.

45:38.235 --> 45:43.730
You held a private meeting with him
at the rectory. A week ago?

45:43.874 --> 45:44.966
Yes.

45:48.879 --> 45:52.474
- What are we talking about?
- Donald Miller.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.019
The boy acted strangely
when he returned to class.

46:01.725 --> 46:02.885
He did?

46:03.026 --> 46:06.484
When he returned from the rectory,
a little odd, yes.

46:07.197 --> 46:08.994
Can you tell us why?

46:11.235 --> 46:13.260
How did he act strangely?

46:14.037 --> 46:15.026
He...

46:16.306 --> 46:21.209
I'm not sure how to explain it.
He laid his head on the desk and...

46:25.315 --> 46:26.748
Do you mean
you had some impression?

46:26.884 --> 46:27.908
Yes.

46:28.051 --> 46:30.519
And he'd come from the rectory,
so you're asking me?

46:30.621 --> 46:31.952
Mmm. That's it.

46:32.723 --> 46:33.951
Hmm.

46:34.057 --> 46:35.251
Mmm.

46:35.926 --> 46:36.893
Mmm.

46:38.595 --> 46:40.529
Did you want to discuss the pageant?
Is that why I'm here?

46:40.631 --> 46:42.496
Or is this what you wanted to discuss?

46:43.333 --> 46:44.459
This.

46:46.069 --> 46:48.970
Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.

46:49.106 --> 46:51.904
Why?
- Why do you think?

46:52.009 --> 46:54.307
The boy's well-being
is my responsibility.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.747
His well-being is not at issue.

46:57.848 --> 47:01.215
I'm not satisfied
that that is true.

47:01.318 --> 47:04.446
He was upset
when he returned to class.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.316
- Did he say something?
- No.

47:09.393 --> 47:11.020
What happened in the rectory?

47:12.496 --> 47:13.656
Happened?

47:13.764 --> 47:14.822
Mmm.

47:14.932 --> 47:16.524
Nothing happened.
I had a talk with the boy.

47:16.633 --> 47:19.101
- What about?
- Private matter.

47:19.203 --> 47:22.263
He's 12 years old.
What could be private?

47:24.708 --> 47:26.505
- Should I get...
- No.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.911
I object to your tone.

47:30.614 --> 47:36.575
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.

47:39.223 --> 47:42.283
- It's about arriving at the truth.
- Of what?

47:42.392 --> 47:48.262
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you? Hmm?

47:48.365 --> 47:53.132
And you're controlling the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?

47:53.237 --> 47:54.602
My face?

47:57.207 --> 47:58.765
What exactly are you accusing me of?

47:58.876 --> 48:01.470
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn.

48:01.578 --> 48:07.175
I am asking you to tell me
what happened in the rectory.

48:13.757 --> 48:16.123
I don't wish to continue this.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.524
And if you're dissatisfied with that,

48:18.662 --> 48:21.631
I suggest
you speak to Monsignor Benedict.

48:22.532 --> 48:27.060
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the result of overwork.

48:28.372 --> 48:31.307
Have a good morning, Sister. Sister.

48:36.380 --> 48:40.749
There was alcohol on his breath

48:42.753 --> 48:45.688
when he returned
from his meeting with you.

48:49.693 --> 48:50.921
Alcohol?

48:52.863 --> 48:55.093
I did smell it on his breath.

49:00.704 --> 49:01.830
Well?

49:06.143 --> 49:08.043
- Let this alone.
- No.

49:17.654 --> 49:21.112
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?

49:22.559 --> 49:24.686
You should've let it alone.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.097
Not possible.

49:36.340 --> 49:39.434
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.

49:41.311 --> 49:46.806
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,

49:48.118 --> 49:52.714
and he begged not to be removed
from the altar boys. I took pity on him.

49:54.024 --> 49:57.323
I told him if no one else found out,
I'd let him stay on.

49:57.461 --> 50:01.261
What a relief. That explains everything.
Thanks be to God.

50:01.365 --> 50:04.334
Look, Sister, it was all a mistake.

50:08.872 --> 50:10.772
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

50:10.874 --> 50:13.069
Talk to him, by all means.

50:13.176 --> 50:14.268
But now that the boy's secret's out,

50:14.378 --> 50:16.107
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the altar boys.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.646
That's what I was trying to avoid.

50:17.781 --> 50:19.214
You were trying
to protect the boy.

50:19.316 --> 50:21.181
That's right.

50:21.451 --> 50:23.817
I might have done the same thing.

50:23.954 --> 50:26.514
Is there a way Donald could stay
on the altar boys?

50:26.656 --> 50:30.649
If the boy drank altar wine,
he can't continue as an altar boy.

50:30.794 --> 50:32.159
Of course.

50:34.631 --> 50:36.428
Are you satisfied?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.126
Yes.

50:41.138 --> 50:42.298
Hmm.

50:43.306 --> 50:45.934
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.437
Intolerance.
- That's right.

50:52.082 --> 50:55.017
I'm not pleased
with how you handled this.

50:55.919 --> 50:57.716
Sister. Sister.

51:06.530 --> 51:07.792
Well...

51:09.933 --> 51:12.561
What a relief. He cleared it all up.

51:15.605 --> 51:17.300
You believe him?

51:19.443 --> 51:20.842
Of course.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.981
Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?

51:26.249 --> 51:28.513
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.

51:28.618 --> 51:29.812
Mmm-hmm.

51:30.587 --> 51:31.713
Yes.

51:33.390 --> 51:35.881
These types of people are clever.

51:39.763 --> 51:42.732
- Well, I'm convinced.
- You're not.

51:43.266 --> 51:47.600
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.

51:48.905 --> 51:50.930
I want no further part of this.

51:52.476 --> 51:54.273
I'll bring him down.

51:55.979 --> 51:58.880
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?

52:02.786 --> 52:04.219
Experience.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.849
You just don't like him.

52:09.593 --> 52:12.926
You don't like it
that he uses a ballpoint pen.

52:13.063 --> 52:16.555
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.

52:16.666 --> 52:18.793
You don't like it
that he likes <i>Frosty the Snowman,</i>

52:18.935 --> 52:23.702
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.

52:25.108 --> 52:27.576
Well, I like <i>Frosty the Snowman!</i>

52:28.345 --> 52:30.609
And I think it would be nice
if this school weren't run like a jail,

52:30.747 --> 52:33.045
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history

52:33.150 --> 52:35.243
and that I might inspire my students
to love it, too.

52:35.352 --> 52:38.321
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,

52:38.455 --> 52:39.945
then so be it!

52:43.660 --> 52:44.991
Sit down.

52:54.604 --> 52:57.801
Look at that. You blew out my light.

53:01.478 --> 53:06.677
In ancient Sparta, important matters
were decided by who shouted loudest.

53:06.816 --> 53:09.751
Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.

53:16.126 --> 53:18.026
You honestly find the students
in this school

53:18.161 --> 53:21.927
to be treated like inmates in a prison?

53:23.066 --> 53:24.192
No.

53:24.968 --> 53:30.031
Actually, they all seem fairly happy,
but they're all uniformly terrified of you.

53:31.841 --> 53:34.810
Yes. That's how it works.

53:36.413 --> 53:37.812
Sit there.

53:53.697 --> 53:55.631
Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

53:55.732 --> 53:59.327
principal at St. Nicholas School.
Is this Mrs. Miller?

54:01.504 --> 54:04.064
I'm calling about your son, Donald.

54:18.088 --> 54:22.218
<i>A woman was gossiping with</i>
<i>a friend about a man she hardly knew.</i>

54:22.926 --> 54:24.518
<i>I know none of you</i>
<i>have ever done this.</i>

54:26.596 --> 54:28.757
<i>That night she had a dream.</i>

54:29.466 --> 54:33.562
<i>A great hand appeared over her</i>
<i>and pointed down at her.</i>

54:35.405 --> 54:39.535
<i>She was immediately seized</i>
<i>with an overwhelming sense of guilt.</i>

54:40.610 --> 54:43.170
<i>The next day she
went to confession.</i>

54:43.280 --> 54:46.181
<i>She got the old parish priest,</i>
<i>Father O'Rourke.</i>

54:47.417 --> 54:49.715
<i>She told him the whole thing.</i>

54:50.253 --> 54:53.916
<i>"Is gossiping a sin?"</i>
<i>she asked the old man.</i>

54:55.125 --> 54:59.221
<i>"Was that the hand of God Almighty</i>
<i>pointing a finger at me?</i>

54:59.329 --> 55:01.957
<i>"Should I be</i>
<i>asking your absolution, Father?</i>

55:02.098 --> 55:05.090
<i>"Tell me,</i>
<i>have I done something wrong?"</i>

55:05.935 --> 55:09.427
<i>"Yes." Father O'Rourke answered her.</i>

55:09.572 --> 55:13.531
<i>"Yes, you ignorant,</i>
<i>badly brought up female.</i>

55:14.644 --> 55:17.477
<i>"You have borne false witness</i>
<i>against your neighbor.</i>

55:17.614 --> 55:20.481
<i>"You have played fast and loose</i>
<i>with his reputation,</i>

55:20.617 --> 55:23.245
<i>"and you should be heartily ashamed!"</i>

55:24.988 --> 55:29.823
<i>So the woman said she was sorry</i>
<i>and asked for forgiveness.</i>

55:30.760 --> 55:33.593
<i>"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.</i>

55:34.364 --> 55:38.926
<i>"I want you to go home.</i>
<i>Take a pillow up on your roof,</i>

55:39.035 --> 55:42.801
<i>"cut it open with a knife,</i>
<i>and return here to me. "</i>

55:44.874 --> 55:48.310
<i>So the woman went home,</i>
<i>took a pillow off her bed,</i>

55:48.878 --> 55:50.402
<i>a knife from the drawer,</i>

55:50.513 --> 55:54.510
<i>went up the fire escape to her
roof and stabbed the pillow.</i>

55:54.651 --> 55:58.087
<i>Then she went back to the old
parish priest as instructed.</i>

55:58.188 --> 56:02.249
<i>"Did you gut the pillow with a knife?"</i>
<i>he says.</i>

56:02.359 --> 56:05.817
<i>"Yes, Father."</i>
<i>"And what was the result?"</i>

56:07.330 --> 56:09.798
<i>"Feathers," she said.</i>

56:13.837 --> 56:15.930
<i>"Feathers," he repeated.</i>

56:19.242 --> 56:21.608
<i>"Feathers everywhere, Father."</i>

56:24.514 --> 56:27.483
<i>"Now, I want you to go back</i>

56:27.584 --> 56:31.486
<i>"and gather up every last feather</i>
<i>that flew out on the wind. "</i>

56:32.489 --> 56:36.516
<i>"Well, " she said, "it can't be done.</i>

56:37.627 --> 56:41.461
<i>"I don't know where they went.</i>
<i>The wind took them all over. "</i>

56:43.333 --> 56:47.702
<i>"And that," said Father O'Rourke,</i>
<i>"is gossip!"</i>

56:50.340 --> 56:54.276
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son</i>
<i>and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

56:58.748 --> 57:00.215
<i>Please rise.</i>

57:32.348 --> 57:34.976
What's that bird complaining about?

57:37.287 --> 57:39.414
What kind of bird is that?

57:39.556 --> 57:42.423
That a starling? A grackle?

57:45.428 --> 57:48.226
- A crow.
- Course it is.

57:49.699 --> 57:51.792
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.

57:51.935 --> 57:53.766
I'm not praying. No.

57:55.772 --> 57:57.467
You seem subdued.

57:58.775 --> 58:01.539
Oh, I can't sleep.

58:02.779 --> 58:04.076
Why not?

58:05.949 --> 58:07.416
Bad dreams.

58:07.851 --> 58:10.285
Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.

58:11.354 --> 58:14.983
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?

58:15.425 --> 58:16.983
Yes. Sometimes.

58:20.330 --> 58:23.629
Was your sermon
directed at anyone in particular?

58:24.868 --> 58:26.631
What do you think?

58:38.481 --> 58:42.918
I received a letter
from my brother in Maryland.

58:43.953 --> 58:45.511
He's very sick.

58:47.457 --> 58:49.789
Then maybe you should go
and see him.

58:49.893 --> 58:51.918
I can't leave my class.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.360
Is it true?

59:04.507 --> 59:05.667
What?

59:07.210 --> 59:09.303
You know what I'm asking.

59:11.514 --> 59:12.606
No.

59:15.752 --> 59:19.313
I saw you put an undershirt
in Donald Miller's locker.

59:21.758 --> 59:25.694
- He left it in the sacristy.
- Why didn't you hand it to him?

59:29.365 --> 59:32.493
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.

59:48.318 --> 59:51.412
It's me that cares about that child,
not her.

59:52.889 --> 59:55.289
Has she ever reached out a hand?

59:57.293 --> 01:00:00.785
That black boy needs help
or he's not gonna make it.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.027
If she has her way,
he'll be left to his own undoing.

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:06.624
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in trouble.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:12.134
And she sees me talk
in a human way to these kids

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:16.541
and she immediately assumes that
there must be something wrong with it.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.545
Well, I'm not gonna let her
keep this parish in the Dark Ages,

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:24.142
and I'm not gonna let her
destroy my spirit of compassion.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.777
I'm sure that's not her intent.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:29.653
- That I care about this congregation.
- I know you do.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:34.422
Like you care about your class.
You love them, don't you?

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:38.092
- Yes.
- And that's natural.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:41.565
How else would you relate to children?

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.001
Now, I can look at your face
and know your philosophy.

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.069
It's kindness.

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:54.006
I don't know. I mean, of course.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:59.743
There are people
who go after your humanity, Sister,

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.956
that tell you that
the light in your heart is a weakness.

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:04.788
Don't believe it.

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:10.989
It's an old tactic of cruel people
to kill kindness in the name of virtue.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.837
There's nothing wrong with love.

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.768
Love?

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.772
Have you forgotten the message
of our Savior?

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:28.112
It's love of people.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:40.519
I just feel
as if everything is upside down.

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:49.695
There are just times in life
when we feel lost. It happens.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.336
And it's a bond.

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.480
- Flowers.
- Yeah.

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.976
To remind me of spring.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.192
I should be going.

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.599
I'm sorry your brother's ill.

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.201
Thank you, Father.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.043
I don't believe it.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.516
You don't?

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.778
No.

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:43.087
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.128
Hey, Anthony!
- That's not funny.

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.605
That's also the day
that I tripped. I broke my ankle.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.799
I barely...

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:03.207
Father. I think
I've just gotta tell somebody.

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.576
- Hello, Noreen.
- I'm in love.

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.641
That's wonderful. Who's the lucky boy?

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.276
- Jimmy Hurley.
- Have you told him?

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.551
For life and death,
I'd go for waffles.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.385
Maybe you should.

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.849
Maybe I will, Father.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.656
Jimmy!

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:22.954
Jimmy Hurley?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.226
Come over here!

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.833
Hurry up, already!

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:32.832
Father Sherman.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.572
Jimmy,
I just gotta tell you something.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.013
You dropped something.

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.414
It's not funny.

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:47.682
Get out of the way.

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:03.496
It's all right.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:07.271
He doesn't like me.
- That is so easy!

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.672
My parents are gonna be
so angry at me.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:24.387
Okay. Be quiet.

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.396
I said be quiet!

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.728
The next one of you that speaks out
of turn gets sent right to the principal.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.736
Now the question was,

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:40.339
what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.481
- Donald.
- Sister?

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:53.416
What was the question?

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.893
Nobody help him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.853
Donald Miller, stand up.

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:09.897
- What was the question, Donald?
- I don't know, Sister.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.840
It means you weren't listening.

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.767
Yes, Sister.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:20.245
The question was, what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:25.786
I don't know.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.287
"Give me liberty or give me death!"

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:30.187
James Hurley,
down to the principal's office.

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.419
Now!

01:05:55.648 --> 01:05:57.775
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.

01:05:57.917 --> 01:05:59.214
Come in.

01:06:01.154 --> 01:06:02.985
Please, have a seat.

01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:09.584
I was changing a bulb.

01:06:10.329 --> 01:06:13.196
Thought I mighta had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.

01:06:13.299 --> 01:06:14.266
Huh?

01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:17.666
Oh, well, just between us,

01:06:19.138 --> 01:06:22.904
I was listening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.

01:06:23.009 --> 01:06:25.239
Look how tiny they're making them.

01:06:25.344 --> 01:06:27.403
I confiscated it
from one of the students,

01:06:27.513 --> 01:06:29.242
now I can't stop listening to it.

01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:31.741
You like music?

01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:36.013
No. News reports.

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:39.090
Years ago I used to listen
to all the news reports,

01:06:39.192 --> 01:06:42.286
because my husband was in Italy,
in the war.

01:06:42.395 --> 01:06:45.262
- You were a married woman?
- Yes.

01:06:46.232 --> 01:06:48.257
But then he was killed.

01:06:49.702 --> 01:06:50.926
Is your husband coming?

01:06:51.037 --> 01:06:53.665
Couldn't get off work.
I only have half an hour myself.

01:06:53.806 --> 01:06:56.800
I see. Of course. It was a lot to ask.

01:07:06.252 --> 01:07:08.117
How's Donald doing?

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:12.152
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.

01:07:12.258 --> 01:07:14.692
Oh. Good.

01:07:15.428 --> 01:07:17.988
He was upset about getting taken off
the altar boys.

01:07:18.097 --> 01:07:20.327
Mmm. Did he explain why?

01:07:20.433 --> 01:07:23.300
He said he was caught
drinking altar wine.

01:07:23.402 --> 01:07:25.233
That is the reason.

01:07:25.771 --> 01:07:28.467
Well, that seems fair.

01:07:30.009 --> 01:07:31.840
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He fell down there,

01:07:31.944 --> 01:07:34.640
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the line.

01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:36.510
How is he at home?

01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:40.649
His father beat the hell out of him
over that wine.

01:07:40.753 --> 01:07:42.152
Oh, he shouldn't do that.

01:07:42.255 --> 01:07:46.055
You don't tell my husband what to do.
You just stand back.

01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:49.895
My husband didn't want Donald
to come here.

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:52.158
- Why?
- He thought he'd have trouble

01:07:52.265 --> 01:07:55.530
with the other boys,
but that hasn't really happened.

01:07:55.635 --> 01:07:56.863
Good.

01:07:57.270 --> 01:08:00.762
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.

01:08:03.142 --> 01:08:04.268
Yes.

01:08:11.584 --> 01:08:13.051
Excuse me.

01:08:22.127 --> 01:08:24.118
James Hurley,
what are you doing out of class?

01:08:24.263 --> 01:08:26.254
- Sister James sent me down.
- What for?

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:29.232
- Talking.
- Well, go back up and shut up!

01:08:30.603 --> 01:08:31.865
Go! Go!

01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:37.970
What's going on?

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:46.251
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.

01:08:47.153 --> 01:08:48.586
Bullshit.

01:08:48.688 --> 01:08:50.814
- What'd you say?
- Nothing!

01:08:57.662 --> 01:08:58.925
You have 20 minutes, you say?

01:09:00.466 --> 01:09:03.229
It's just that I have to walk to work.

01:09:03.336 --> 01:09:05.736
- Where is work?
- Parkchester.

01:09:05.837 --> 01:09:09.171
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to let Donald in.

01:09:09.308 --> 01:09:12.470
- May I walk with you?
- I don't mind.

01:09:15.613 --> 01:09:17.479
Eight sixty-fourths.

01:09:18.517 --> 01:09:21.680
Who can tell me
what the common denominator is?

01:09:21.821 --> 01:09:23.082
Nobody?

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:27.254
Back already, Mr. Hurley?

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.361
- I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?
- Leave me alone!

01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:34.194
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:09:34.332 --> 01:09:37.791
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.506
I'm sorry.

01:09:50.049 --> 01:09:52.711
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

01:09:56.555 --> 01:09:58.682
Have you met
Father Flynn?

01:09:58.924 --> 01:10:01.290
Just seen him on the altar.
Haven't met him face to face.

01:10:01.394 --> 01:10:03.828
No, just, you know, heard from Donald.

01:10:03.929 --> 01:10:05.294
And what does he say?

01:10:05.398 --> 01:10:08.026
You know,
"Father Flynn, Father Flynn."

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:10.863
He looks up to him. Man gives him
his time, which is what the boy needs.

01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:12.527
He needs that.

01:10:13.038 --> 01:10:15.802
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.

01:10:17.076 --> 01:10:18.976
I thought there must a been a reason
you wanting to see me.

01:10:19.078 --> 01:10:21.012
Principal's a big job.

01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:25.078
I just want to say though,
it's just till June.

01:10:25.217 --> 01:10:26.582
Excuse me?

01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:32.187
Whatever the problem is,
Donald just has to make it till June.

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:34.657
Then he's off into high school.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.988
Right.

01:10:36.595 --> 01:10:38.426
If Donald can graduate
from St. Nicholas,

01:10:38.564 --> 01:10:41.328
he has a better chance
of getting into a good high school,

01:10:41.434 --> 01:10:44.562
and that would mean
an opportunity at college.

01:10:45.571 --> 01:10:47.266
I don't see anything at this time

01:10:47.406 --> 01:10:50.898
standing in the way
of his graduating with his class.

01:10:51.977 --> 01:10:55.105
- Well, that's all I care about.
- I doubt that.

01:10:55.714 --> 01:10:56.942
Try me.

01:10:59.752 --> 01:11:04.553
I am concerned about the relationship
between Father Flynn and your son.

01:11:04.657 --> 01:11:08.252
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:10.453
That it may not be right.

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.622
Well, there's something wrong
with everybody,

01:11:13.766 --> 01:11:17.258
and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.

01:11:17.636 --> 01:11:20.571
I am concerned, to be frank,

01:11:23.943 --> 01:11:27.743
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.

01:11:32.017 --> 01:11:33.575
May have made?

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.115
I can't be certain.

01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:38.052
- No evidence?
- No.

01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:41.716
Then maybe there's nothing to it.

01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:51.726
I think there is something to it.

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:55.100
I think Father Flynn
gave Donald that altar wine.

01:11:55.207 --> 01:11:57.107
Why would he do that?

01:12:00.446 --> 01:12:03.643
- Has Donald been acting strangely?
- No.

01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:06.182
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- He's been himself.

01:12:06.318 --> 01:12:09.014
- All right.
- Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.

01:12:09.154 --> 01:12:11.418
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.

01:12:11.524 --> 01:12:13.458
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're talking about,

01:12:13.559 --> 01:12:16.153
but I don't want to get into it.

01:12:16.295 --> 01:12:17.762
What's that?

01:12:20.065 --> 01:12:22.761
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,

01:12:22.868 --> 01:12:25.666
but if we're talking about
something floating around

01:12:25.804 --> 01:12:28.170
between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fault.

01:12:28.307 --> 01:12:30.832
- I'm not suggesting that...
- He's just a boy.

01:12:30.976 --> 01:12:32.170
- I know.
- Twelve years old.

01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:33.869
If someone should be taking blame,
it should be the man...

01:12:34.013 --> 01:12:36.004
- I know. I agree with you completely.
...not the boy.

01:12:36.148 --> 01:12:37.376
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called

01:12:37.516 --> 01:12:38.642
to the principal,
if you know what I'm saying.

01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:42.152
I am concerned about Donald's welfare.

01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:46.382
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?

01:12:46.525 --> 01:12:47.856
Yes, I do.

01:12:47.993 --> 01:12:50.359
Then how come my son
got kicked off the altar boys

01:12:50.496 --> 01:12:52.521
- if it was a man that gave it to him?
- I know.

01:12:52.665 --> 01:12:55.190
The boy got caught, the man didn't.

01:12:57.903 --> 01:12:59.302
- So you're giving my son the blame.
- No.

01:12:59.405 --> 01:13:00.372
No problem my son getting blamed,

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:02.371
- and you know why that is.
- Perhaps you should let me talk.

01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.601
- I think you're getting upset.
- Sister, you ain't going against

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:06.007
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.

01:13:06.145 --> 01:13:09.308
- And he's got your son.
- Let him have him then.

01:13:11.717 --> 01:13:12.877
What?

01:13:15.087 --> 01:13:16.952
It's just till June.

01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:21.524
Do you know what you're saying?

01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:24.825
Know more about it than you.

01:13:26.665 --> 01:13:30.066
I believe this man is creating,

01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:32.295
or may have already brought about,

01:13:32.404 --> 01:13:34.838
an improper relationship with your son.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.407
I don't know.

01:13:36.842 --> 01:13:38.309
I know I am right.

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:42.506
Why you gotta know something
like that for sure when you don't?

01:13:43.616 --> 01:13:45.880
What kind of mother are you?

01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:52.591
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about life to say a thing like that, Sister.

01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:53.749
I know enough.

01:13:53.892 --> 01:13:55.757
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.

01:13:55.894 --> 01:13:57.725
I know what I won't accept.

01:13:57.863 --> 01:13:59.922
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.

01:14:00.065 --> 01:14:01.157
This man is in my school.

01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:02.358
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and

01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:04.095
- maybe he's doing some good, too.
- He is after the boys!

01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:07.535
Well, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught!

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:21.951
That's why his father beat him.

01:14:25.624 --> 01:14:27.114
Not the wine.

01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:37.426
What are you telling me?

01:14:41.774 --> 01:14:44.572
I'm talking about the boy's nature now,

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:47.969
not anything he's done.

01:14:49.782 --> 01:14:53.878
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.

01:14:56.488 --> 01:14:59.548
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.

01:14:59.658 --> 01:15:01.558
But then there's the boy's nature.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.754
- Leave that out of it.
- Well, forget it then.

01:15:06.198 --> 01:15:09.224
You're the one
forcing people to say things.

01:15:12.838 --> 01:15:13.998
My boy came to your school

01:15:14.139 --> 01:15:17.666
'cause they were gonna kill him
in the public school.

01:15:20.345 --> 01:15:22.472
His father don't like him.

01:15:23.048 --> 01:15:26.074
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.

01:15:26.852 --> 01:15:29.480
One man is good to him, this priest.

01:15:30.389 --> 01:15:33.153
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.

01:15:34.326 --> 01:15:37.454
Everybody does.
You have your reasons,

01:15:38.697 --> 01:15:41.791
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?

01:15:43.802 --> 01:15:44.928
No.

01:15:48.741 --> 01:15:50.470
I don't care why.

01:15:53.979 --> 01:15:58.712
My son needs some man
to care about him

01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:03.181
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.

01:16:03.655 --> 01:16:05.520
And thank God this educated man

01:16:05.657 --> 01:16:08.626
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.

01:16:08.727 --> 01:16:11.389
- This will not do.
- It's just till June.

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.521
I'll throw your son out of this school.

01:16:13.665 --> 01:16:15.826
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?

01:16:15.934 --> 01:16:18.232
Because I will stop this.

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:20.133
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:23.140
- It won't end with your son.
- Throw the priest out then.

01:16:23.242 --> 01:16:27.338
- I am trying to do just that.
- Then what do you want from me?

01:16:35.053 --> 01:16:36.350
Nothing.

01:16:40.692 --> 01:16:42.353
As it turns out.

01:16:43.462 --> 01:16:46.329
Please leave my son
out of this.

01:16:54.373 --> 01:16:58.002
My husband will kill that child
over a thing like this.

01:17:07.653 --> 01:17:09.052
I will try.

01:17:19.097 --> 01:17:20.428
I'm late.

01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:24.430
Sister,

01:17:27.306 --> 01:17:30.298
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:35.440
I'll be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.

01:17:35.948 --> 01:17:39.440
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.

01:18:58.497 --> 01:19:00.021
May I come in?

01:19:00.732 --> 01:19:02.393
A third party would be required.

01:19:02.534 --> 01:19:05.469
Yeah. What was Donald's mother
doing here?

01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:08.662
- We were having a chat.
- About what?

01:19:08.774 --> 01:19:10.241
A third party
would truly be required, Father.

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.138
No, Sister. No third party!

01:19:12.244 --> 01:19:14.906
Me and you are due for a talk!

01:19:15.047 --> 01:19:17.515
You have to stop
this campaign against me.

01:19:17.616 --> 01:19:20.517
- You can stop it at any time.
- How?

01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:21.745
Confess and resign.

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:24.185
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation!

01:19:24.289 --> 01:19:27.520
Who keeps opening my window?

01:19:29.094 --> 01:19:30.925
What are you doing in this school?

01:19:31.063 --> 01:19:32.928
I'm trying to do good.

01:19:33.432 --> 01:19:35.525
Even more to the point,

01:19:35.634 --> 01:19:38.569
what are you doing in the priesthood?

01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:42.902
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:45.108
- From what?
- Progressive education

01:19:45.243 --> 01:19:46.403
and a welcoming church.

01:19:46.545 --> 01:19:48.672
You can't distract me, Father.

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.247
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.

01:19:50.382 --> 01:19:52.373
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.

01:19:52.484 --> 01:19:55.715
- That's right. I have suspicions.
- Just leave that. It's not important.

01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:57.755
I will decide

01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:02.693
what's important.

01:20:02.794 --> 01:20:05.558
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?

01:20:07.165 --> 01:20:10.896
You gave that boy wine,
and you let him take the blame.

01:20:11.003 --> 01:20:13.938
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?

01:20:14.072 --> 01:20:16.438
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.

01:20:16.575 --> 01:20:18.736
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.

01:20:18.844 --> 01:20:21.074
Did his mother
have something to add to that?

01:20:21.179 --> 01:20:22.271
No.

01:20:23.248 --> 01:20:26.911
- So that's it.
- I am not satisfied.

01:20:27.019 --> 01:20:28.782
Ask the boy then.

01:20:29.354 --> 01:20:32.084
- He'd protect you.
- Why would he do that?

01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:36.092
- Because you have seduced him.
- You're insane.

01:20:36.194 --> 01:20:38.662
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child

01:20:38.797 --> 01:20:41.823
after giving him wine,
and nothing I say will change that.

01:20:41.967 --> 01:20:43.161
That's right.

01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:44.825
But this has nothing to do
with the wine.

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:48.133
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.

01:20:48.273 --> 01:20:52.073
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?

01:20:52.177 --> 01:20:53.439
That's true.

01:20:53.545 --> 01:20:55.775
- So you admit it!
- Certainly.

01:20:57.382 --> 01:20:58.508
Why?

01:21:00.852 --> 01:21:02.410
I know people.

01:21:03.855 --> 01:21:05.322
That's not good enough.

01:21:05.457 --> 01:21:08.255
- It won't have to be.
- How's that?

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.988
You will tell me what you have done.

01:21:12.597 --> 01:21:14.360
Oh, I will.

01:21:16.401 --> 01:21:17.800
Out again.

01:21:19.337 --> 01:21:22.101
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.

01:21:22.374 --> 01:21:24.706
So you talked to Sister James.

01:21:25.744 --> 01:21:27.974
Well, of course
you talked to Sister James.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.139
Did you know
Donald's father beats him?

01:21:30.248 --> 01:21:31.374
Yes.

01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:34.642
And might that not account
for the odd behavior

01:21:34.753 --> 01:21:37.517
Sister James noticed in the boy?

01:21:37.722 --> 01:21:39.121
It might.

01:21:39.324 --> 01:21:41.189
Then what is it? What?

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.290
What did you hear?

01:21:44.396 --> 01:21:47.729
What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?

01:21:49.334 --> 01:21:51.165
What does it matter?

01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:56.370
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.188
Out this window,

01:22:10.622 --> 01:22:15.082
I saw you grab William London's wrist,

01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:19.061
and I saw him pull away.

01:22:34.846 --> 01:22:36.939
- Are you serious?
- I am.

01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:40.140
That's all?

01:22:40.819 --> 01:22:43.617
Yeah. That was all.

01:22:47.325 --> 01:22:48.917
That's nothing.

01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:54.259
- What are you doing now?
- I'm writing down what you say.

01:22:54.366 --> 01:22:58.962
It might be important when I have
to explain why you have to be removed.

01:23:04.476 --> 01:23:07.968
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. Miller,

01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:11.480
I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.

01:23:12.217 --> 01:23:13.912
What did he say?

01:23:14.786 --> 01:23:16.515
- Who?
- The pastor.

01:23:18.657 --> 01:23:22.184
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.

01:23:23.195 --> 01:23:25.921
You should have spoken to the pastor.

01:23:27.032 --> 01:23:28.294
I spoke to a nun.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.834
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.

01:23:30.969 --> 01:23:33.836
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.

01:23:33.972 --> 01:23:36.839
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?

01:23:36.975 --> 01:23:39.967
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past!

01:23:40.078 --> 01:23:41.875
You have a history.

01:23:42.013 --> 01:23:44.675
This is your third parish in five years.

01:23:44.816 --> 01:23:46.181
- Why?
- Call the pastor.

01:23:46.384 --> 01:23:49.012
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.

01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:51.952
- I'm not calling the pastor.
- I'm a good priest.

01:23:52.057 --> 01:23:55.117
Go after another child and
another child, until you are stopped.

01:23:55.227 --> 01:23:57.695
- What nun did you speak to?
- I won't say.

01:23:57.829 --> 01:24:00.798
- Yeah, I've not touched a child.
- You have!

01:24:01.366 --> 01:24:03.698
You haven't the slightest proof
of anything.

01:24:03.835 --> 01:24:05.496
But I have my certainty.

01:24:05.604 --> 01:24:07.697
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish

01:24:07.839 --> 01:24:10.831
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.

01:24:10.942 --> 01:24:13.376
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

01:24:14.412 --> 01:24:17.404
You have no right to act on your own!

01:24:18.216 --> 01:24:22.380
You have taken vows,
obedience being one!

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.317
You answer to us!

01:24:24.422 --> 01:24:27.414
You have no right
to step outside the church!

01:24:27.559 --> 01:24:31.086
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,

01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:32.992
though the door should shut
behind me!

01:24:33.098 --> 01:24:38.001
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell!

01:24:38.236 --> 01:24:42.605
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.

01:24:45.744 --> 01:24:48.872
Now, did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:52.775
Have you never done anything wrong?

01:24:53.385 --> 01:24:55.615
- I have.
- No mortal sin?

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.356
Yes.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.526
And?

01:25:12.304 --> 01:25:15.967
I confessed it, Father.

01:25:18.743 --> 01:25:20.870
Then whatever I have done,

01:25:21.513 --> 01:25:24.880
I have left in the healing hands
of my confessor.

01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:27.651
As have you.

01:25:29.187 --> 01:25:30.882
We are the same.

01:25:35.226 --> 01:25:36.420
Mmm-mmm.

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:41.458
No, we are not. We are not the same.

01:25:51.943 --> 01:25:54.776
A dog that bites is a dog that bites.

01:25:57.115 --> 01:26:00.016
Did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

01:26:01.219 --> 01:26:02.277
No.

01:26:03.888 --> 01:26:05.788
Mental reservations?

01:26:07.025 --> 01:26:08.117
No.

01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:12.593
You lie.

01:26:16.234 --> 01:26:17.826
Very well then.

01:26:20.372 --> 01:26:24.536
If you will not leave my office, I will.

01:26:28.046 --> 01:26:30.947
And once I go, I will not stop.

01:26:37.088 --> 01:26:38.282
Wait.

01:27:05.016 --> 01:27:07.814
I can't say everything, you understand?

01:27:09.721 --> 01:27:11.916
There's things I can't say,

01:27:13.925 --> 01:27:16.894
even if you can't imagine
the explanation, Sister.

01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:23.192
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.

01:27:24.936 --> 01:27:29.873
Even if you feel certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.

01:27:34.612 --> 01:27:36.773
You will request a transfer

01:27:38.616 --> 01:27:41.949
and take a leave of absence
until it's granted.

01:27:44.656 --> 01:27:46.681
You'd leave me nothing.

01:27:47.459 --> 01:27:50.053
It's Donald Miller who has nothing,

01:27:51.396 --> 01:27:53.227
and you took full advantage of that.

01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:57.233
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.

01:27:58.303 --> 01:27:59.463
Why?

01:28:03.007 --> 01:28:05.066
'Cause you smile at him?

01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:08.374
And you sympathize with him?

01:28:09.481 --> 01:28:12.473
And you talk to him
as if you were the same?

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.454
You are a cheat.

01:28:21.793 --> 01:28:24.557
And that warm feeling you experienced

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:30.493
when that boy looked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.

01:28:31.936 --> 01:28:35.497
That could be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.

01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:39.404
I can fight you.

01:28:40.144 --> 01:28:41.634
You will lose.

01:28:44.849 --> 01:28:46.840
Where's your compassion?

01:28:49.354 --> 01:28:51.481
Nowhere you can get at it.

01:28:54.893 --> 01:28:58.021
Stay here. Compose yourself.

01:28:59.731 --> 01:29:02.291
You can use the phone if you'd like.

01:29:03.735 --> 01:29:05.464
Good day, Father.

01:29:16.848 --> 01:29:19.043
I have no sympathy for you.

01:29:21.553 --> 01:29:24.681
I know you are invulnerable
to true regret.

01:29:31.262 --> 01:29:33.059
And cut your nails.

01:30:27.919 --> 01:30:33.585
<i>Praise God,</i>
<i>from whom all blessings flow</i>

01:30:33.858 --> 01:30:39.023
<i>Praise him all
creatures here below</i>

01:30:39.764 --> 01:30:44.997
<i>Praise him above, ye heavenly host</i>

01:30:45.637 --> 01:30:51.542
<i>Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost</i>

01:30:51.943 --> 01:30:57.882
<i>Amen</i>

01:31:05.923 --> 01:31:08.118
<i>I never like to say goodbye,</i>

01:31:11.529 --> 01:31:16.296
<i>but there is a wind behind every one</i>
<i>of us that takes us through our lives.</i>

01:31:18.636 --> 01:31:22.572
<i>We never see it.
We can't command it.</i>

01:31:24.042 --> 01:31:26.442
<i>We don't even know its purpose.</i>

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.906
<i>'Cause I would have stayed</i>
<i>among you longer,</i>

01:31:32.016 --> 01:31:34.450
<i>but that wind is taking me away.</i>

01:31:39.891 --> 01:31:41.756
<i>I will miss it here,</i>

01:31:43.327 --> 01:31:45.158
<i>and I will miss you.</i>

01:31:46.998 --> 01:31:51.025
<i>But I'm content that the power</i>
<i>that propels me</i>

01:31:52.236 --> 01:31:55.296
<i>does so with superior knowledge</i>

01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:58.501
<i>as to what is for the best,</i>

01:32:00.912 --> 01:32:02.812
<i>and that is my faith.</i>

01:32:07.251 --> 01:32:09.981
<i>I would like to come down now</i>
<i>among you</i>

01:32:10.688 --> 01:32:12.349
<i>and say goodbye</i>

01:32:13.925 --> 01:32:16.189
<i>and wish you peaceful hearts</i>

01:32:16.861 --> 01:32:18.624
<i>and loving hearts.</i>

01:32:29.674 --> 01:32:31.505
- Goodbye, Senator.
- Father.

01:32:32.577 --> 01:32:34.306
Carol. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:32:34.412 --> 01:32:36.073
Bless you, Father.

01:32:36.214 --> 01:32:39.809
- Happy holidays. Susan. Bless you.
- Thank you, Father.

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:42.477
- Father.
- Thank you.

01:32:42.587 --> 01:32:45.021
Be good. Thank you.

01:32:45.123 --> 01:32:49.059
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:54.755
Paul. Thank you so much.

01:32:55.566 --> 01:32:58.433
God bless you. Goodbye.

01:33:38.643 --> 01:33:40.770
<i>... a midnight clear</i>

01:33:41.179 --> 01:33:45.047
<i>A glorious song of old</i>

01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:50.145
<i>From angels bending near the Earth</i>

01:34:14.178 --> 01:34:17.079
Sister James. Welcome back.

01:34:17.181 --> 01:34:18.580
Thank you, Sister.

01:34:18.683 --> 01:34:21.345
You were missed. How is your brother?

01:34:21.986 --> 01:34:23.647
Better. Much better.

01:34:23.788 --> 01:34:26.814
I'm very glad. I prayed for him.

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:31.324
It was good to get away.
I needed to see my family.

01:34:31.429 --> 01:34:34.830
Mmm. Then I'm glad you did it.

01:34:38.302 --> 01:34:40.361
And Father Flynn is gone?

01:34:41.706 --> 01:34:42.832
Yes.

01:34:45.877 --> 01:34:48.209
So you did it. You got him out.

01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:50.038
Yes.

01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:55.348
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

01:34:55.486 --> 01:34:59.388
Can't be helped. It's just till June.

01:35:03.494 --> 01:35:06.622
I don't think Father Flynn
did anything wrong.

01:35:07.265 --> 01:35:09.460
No? He convinced you?

01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:11.762
- Yes, he did.
- Mmm.

01:35:17.708 --> 01:35:19.573
Did you ever prove it?

01:35:20.845 --> 01:35:24.372
- To whom?
- Anyone but yourself?

01:35:25.716 --> 01:35:26.876
Nope.

01:35:27.385 --> 01:35:29.910
- But you were sure?
- Yes.

01:35:34.425 --> 01:35:36.655
I wish I could be like you.

01:35:38.729 --> 01:35:39.821
Why?

01:35:41.465 --> 01:35:43.763
Because I can't sleep anymore.

01:35:47.471 --> 01:35:51.202
Maybe we're not supposed to
sleep so well.

01:35:53.978 --> 01:35:57.175
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.

01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:02.676
- Who?
- The bishop.

01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:10.523
Appointed Father Flynn pastor
of Saint Jerome Church and School.

01:36:12.096 --> 01:36:13.791
It's a promotion.

01:36:15.232 --> 01:36:16.859
You didn't tell them?

01:36:16.968 --> 01:36:21.803
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.

01:36:25.343 --> 01:36:27.868
He did not believe it to be true.

01:36:31.749 --> 01:36:34.411
Then why did Father Flynn go?

01:36:34.518 --> 01:36:37.112
What did you say to make him leave?

01:36:37.755 --> 01:36:40.986
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,

01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:47.063
that I had found out
his prior history of infringements.

01:36:52.336 --> 01:36:54.133
So you did prove it?

01:36:58.676 --> 01:37:00.473
I made no such call.

01:37:04.682 --> 01:37:07.583
- You lied?
- Yes.

01:37:08.886 --> 01:37:13.619
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.

01:37:17.161 --> 01:37:19.755
His resignation was his confession.

01:37:24.835 --> 01:37:27.167
He was what I thought he was.

01:37:30.207 --> 01:37:31.765
And he's gone.

01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:38.672
I can't believe you lied.

01:37:44.555 --> 01:37:46.819
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

01:37:47.858 --> 01:37:50.349
one steps away from God.

01:37:54.031 --> 01:37:56.295
Of course, there is a price.

01:38:04.842 --> 01:38:06.002
I see.

01:38:14.985 --> 01:38:15.952
Oh.

01:38:16.587 --> 01:38:18.054
Sister James.

01:38:19.523 --> 01:38:21.252
What is it, Sister?

01:38:27.531 --> 01:38:29.499
I have doubts.

01:38:36.107 --> 01:38:40.441
I have such doubts.

01:39:28.959 --> 01:39:35.660
<i> Come, thou,</i>
<i>redeemer of the Earth</i>

01:39:36.033 --> 01:39:42.768
<i>And manifest thy virgin birth</i>

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:49.741
<i>Let every age adoring fall</i>

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:56.909
<i>Such birth befits the God of all</i>

01:39:58.389 --> 01:40:05.124
<i>Begotten of no human will</i>

01:40:05.529 --> 01:40:12.059
<i>But of the Spirit, thou art still</i>

01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:19.533
<i>The word of God in flesh arrayed</i>

01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:26.848
<i>The promised fruit
to man displayed</i>

01:40:28.886 --> 01:40:35.621
<i>The virgin womb that burden gained</i>

01:40:35.859 --> 01:40:42.423
<i>With virgin honor all unstained</i>

01:40:43.067 --> 01:40:49.700
<i>The banners there of virtue glow</i>

01:40:50.241 --> 01:40:57.044
<i>God in his temple dwells below</i>

01:40:59.717 --> 01:41:06.452
<i>Forth from his chamber goeth he</i>

01:41:06.857 --> 01:41:13.695
<i>That royal home of purity</i>

01:41:14.131 --> 01:41:21.094
<i>A giant in twofold substance one</i>

01:41:21.572 --> 01:41:28.501
<i>Rejoicing now his course to run</i>

01:41:30.681 --> 01:41:37.644
<i>From God the Father he proceeds</i>

01:41:37.988 --> 01:41:44.951
<i>To God the Father back he speeds</i>

01:41:45.529 --> 01:41:52.492
<i>His course he runs
to death and hell</i>

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:59.833
<i>Returning on God's throne to dwell</i>

01:42:02.313 --> 01:42:09.219
<i>O equal to thy Father, thou</i>

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:16.123
<i>Gird on thy fleshly mantle now</i>

01:42:16.593 --> 01:42:23.522
<i>The weakness of our mortal state</i>

01:42:24.068 --> 01:42:31.031
<i>With deathless might invigorate</i>

01:42:33.677 --> 01:42:40.515
<i>Thy cradle here
shall glitter bright</i>

01:42:40.918 --> 01:42:47.847
<i>And darkness breathe a newer light</i>

01:42:48.192 --> 01:42:55.155
<i>Where endless faith
shall shine serene</i>

01:42:55.399 --> 01:43:02.328
<i>And twilight never intervene</i>

01:43:04.641 --> 01:43:11.604
<i>All praise, eternal Son, to thee</i>

01:43:13.083 --> 01:43:19.022
<i>Whose advent sets thy people free</i>

01:43:19.123 --> 01:43:25.961
<i>Whom, with the Father, we adore</i>

01:43:26.597 --> 01:43:33.435
<i>And Holy Ghost for evermore</i>

01:43:35.939 --> 01:43:42.902
<i>Amen</i>
