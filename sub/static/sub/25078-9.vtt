00:34.029 --> 00:39.692
Our planet's continents are fringed
by shallow seas.

00:41.120 --> 00:46.033
Rarely more than 200 meters deep
they lie on the continental shelves

00:46.178 --> 00:49.300
which may stretch sometimes
for hundreds of miles

00:49.373 --> 00:54.092
before the sea floor drops into
deeper darker waters.

00:59.658 --> 01:04.522
All together they constitute
a mere eight percent of the world's oceans

01:04.571 --> 01:09.847
but they contain the vast majority
of it's marine life.

01:44.016 --> 01:49.740
A male humpback whale sings to attract a mate.

02:10.994 --> 02:14.999
The whales have just returned
to their breeding grounds

02:15.097 --> 02:18.462
in the shallow seas of the tropics.

02:25.208 --> 02:29.623
The calf is no more than a few weeks old.

02:34.694 --> 02:39.207
Despite being three meters long
and weighing nearly a ton

02:39.339 --> 02:42.720
he is nonetheless vulnerable.

02:46.215 --> 02:48.234
but his mother watches over him

02:48.480 --> 02:53.567
and, as he begins to tire,
she supports him close to the surface

02:53.699 --> 02:57.441
so that he can breathe more easily.

03:20.564 --> 03:25.323
These shallows around the equator
are excellent nurseries.

03:25.389 --> 03:30.739
They're warm, calm, and contain
very few predators.

03:33.380 --> 03:38.435
The playful calf is now drinking
five hundred liters of milk a day

03:38.928 --> 03:41.242
but his mother must starve.

03:41.783 --> 03:45.328
There is nothing for her to eat here.

03:52.452 --> 03:55.077
Like many tropical shallow seas

03:55.143 --> 03:58.508
these crystal clear waters
are virtually lifeless.

03:58.737 --> 04:01.035
They receive year round sunlight

04:01.133 --> 04:05.089
but they lack the nutrients
essential for the growth of plankton.

04:05.990 --> 04:09.011
The mother will be trapped here
for the next five months

04:09.158 --> 04:16.214
until her calf is strong enough to make
the journey to the feeding grounds, near the poles.

04:39.552 --> 04:43.852
Coral reefs are oases in a watery desert.

04:44.968 --> 04:47.791
Most tropical shallows are barren

04:47.938 --> 04:54.322
but these coral havens contain one quarter
of all the marine life on our planet.

05:13.705 --> 05:16.002
Reefs are the work of polyps

05:16.167 --> 05:20.039
tiny colonial animals like minute sea anemones

05:20.466 --> 05:26.768
yet the great barrier reef is so big
it can be seen from the Moon.

05:32.677 --> 05:35.926
It's actually two thousand separate reefs

05:36.122 --> 05:40.652
that together form a barrier
stretching for over a thousand miles

05:40.701 --> 05:43.819
along Australia's northeastern coast.

05:47.182 --> 05:49.546
Despite it's vast size

05:49.612 --> 05:55.077
this reef does not contain the greatest variety
of marine life on the planet.

05:56.571 --> 06:01.034
For that one must travel north to Indonesia.

06:28.410 --> 06:34.286
There are individual reefs in Indonesia
that contain almost as many kinds of fish

06:34.417 --> 06:37.354
as live in the whole of the Caribbean.

06:39.012 --> 06:43.279
There are also ten times the number
of coral species.

06:46.003 --> 06:51.698
Corals thrive in these waters
with the help of microscopic plants, algae

06:51.715 --> 06:55.490
that grow within the tissues of the polyps

07:01.119 --> 07:06.764
and the polyps feed by snaring passing
morsels with their tentacles.

07:18.925 --> 07:25.342
At night, the algae are inactive but then,
the polyps put out even more tentacles

07:25.473 --> 07:29.510
so coral in effect feeds around the clock.

07:47.252 --> 07:53.422
This well balanced alliance
brings benefits to both polyps and algae

07:53.668 --> 07:59.151
and between them, they turn the barren seas
into rich gardens.

08:09.310 --> 08:13.281
The Indonesian reefs
contain such a variety of life

08:13.429 --> 08:16.498
because they lie at a giant crossroads.

08:16.761 --> 08:23.161
This is the meeting place for different seas
the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.

08:26.017 --> 08:29.397
Here everything demands a closer look.

08:29.643 --> 08:35.010
On the surface of this sea fan,
there are two polyps that are not polyps.

08:35.634 --> 08:42.280
They're pygmy sea horses, the world's smallest,
less than two centimeters high.

08:54.786 --> 09:01.154
They are males, settling a territorial dispute,
by head butting.

09:09.770 --> 09:12.166
An electric flash?

09:13.379 --> 09:17.565
No, the display of a file clam.

09:22.259 --> 09:26.641
Perhaps this extraordinary pulsation
of the clam's fleshy mantle

09:26.739 --> 09:33.304
is a warning to frighten away nibbling fish,
but no one really knows

09:47.419 --> 09:52.178
And there are snakes here, too,
lots of them.

09:57.675 --> 10:03.353
These are banded sea crates.
They lay their eggs on land

10:03.517 --> 10:07.013
but they hunt here in the water.

10:11.280 --> 10:15.136
They're too slow to catch fish
in a straight chase

10:15.334 --> 10:20.011
so they seek prey that is hiding
in the nooks and crannies of the coral.

10:22.554 --> 10:27.068
Their bite is highly venomous
and paralyzes their victims.

10:32.025 --> 10:37.014
And on this reef
the snakes do not hunt alone.

10:42.593 --> 10:47.845
Shoals of yellow goatfish and trivali
are seeking similar prey

10:48.092 --> 10:53.885
And they attract the snakes' attention.
As one group of hunters searches the reef

10:54.098 --> 10:56.839
they're joined by the other.

11:04.751 --> 11:09.280
At least thirty snakes
have now joined the caravan.

11:15.204 --> 11:21.490
The big fish scare the prey into cracks
and there the snakes can catch them

11:22.196 --> 11:28.071
And anything fleeing from the crates will swim
straight into the mouths of the waiting trivali.

11:29.286 --> 11:31.453
There's nowhere to hide.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.056
As the raiders scour the reef,
more and more snakes join the hunt.

12:05.064 --> 12:10.332
This cooperation between snakes and fish,
spectacular though it is,

12:10.333 --> 12:17.569
has only recently been observed, for it only happens
on the most remote reefs in Indonesia.

12:26.528 --> 12:30.385
Perhaps such hunting alliances
were once a common sight

12:30.567 --> 12:36.803
but today no more than six percent
of Indonesia's reefs are in their pristine state.

13:05.226 --> 13:09.739
Beyond the coral
stretches a world of shifting sand.

13:10.576 --> 13:14.466
Out there with nowhere to hide
survival is not easy

13:14.728 --> 13:17.617
and camouflage can be crucial.

13:20.177 --> 13:27.119
If this wasn't moving, you might think
it was a shell or a rock. In fact it's an octopus.

13:29.186 --> 13:33.766
A gurnard.
It's huge pectoral fins disguise it's shape

13:34.274 --> 13:38.804
and they can also help in clearing away sand
when searching for food.

13:43.247 --> 13:46.694
The jawfish hides underground.

13:48.696 --> 13:52.914
The wonderpus octopus on the other hand
has such a powerful bite

13:52.963 --> 13:57.804
that it has a special warning display
to tell others to keep out of it's way.

14:10.081 --> 14:13.478
Here and there,
plants manage to take root

14:14.168 --> 14:17.123
and they're cropped by green turtles.

14:17.595 --> 14:22.544
Seagrasses are the only flowering plants
that have managed to grow in the sea

14:22.859 --> 14:25.472
although they put out a few ribbon like leaves

14:25.552 --> 14:29.989
they produce very extended networks
of fleshy stems, risomes,

14:30.159 --> 14:32.667
that are buried in the sand.

14:39.481 --> 14:42.789
At their lushest
they can transform the sea bed

14:42.947 --> 14:45.350
into an underwater meadow.

14:46.374 --> 14:52.690
The largest expanse grows in the shallow waters
of Shark Bay, in Western Australia.

14:55.158 --> 15:00.856
These vast aquatic grasslands
stretch for fifteen hundred square miles

15:01.249 --> 15:06.317
and, like terrestrial prairies,
they support herds of grazers.

15:07.026 --> 15:08.614
Dugongs.

15:22.086 --> 15:25.446
Dugongs are the largest herbivores in the sea.

15:25.867 --> 15:28.729
They can be three meters long
and weigh half a ton

15:28.900 --> 15:33.168
and they eat nothing but seagrass,
mostly the fleshy risomes,

15:33.259 --> 15:36.647
which they excavate with their mobile lips.

15:51.785 --> 15:56.445
A herd can clear a patch of seagrass
the size of a football pitch

15:56.814 --> 15:58.493
in a single day.

16:22.876 --> 16:27.353
Food is not evenly distributed
in the tropical shallow seas

16:27.457 --> 16:29.466
and it can take a lot of finding

16:29.991 --> 16:35.938
but bottlenose dolphins are inquisitive,
energetic,1 and very intelligent

16:36.174 --> 16:39.824
and they have discovered a shoal of baitfish.

16:47.544 --> 16:52.336
Together, they ride a wave,
using it to carry them into the shallows

16:52.795 --> 16:56.629
and there, it will be easier to make the catch.

17:23.529 --> 17:25.406
In Western Australia

17:25.604 --> 17:29.805
these dolphins have taken on
an ever tougher challenge.

17:30.646 --> 17:33.771
The fish have taken refuge close to the beach

17:33.901 --> 17:37.368
where the water is only a few centimeters deep.

17:41.280 --> 17:46.532
Tail slapping is a method dolphins often use
to stun their prey

17:46.847 --> 17:49.433
but it doesn't seem to work here.

17:59.529 --> 18:02.365
The fish are tantalizingly close

18:02.746 --> 18:08.733
but they're still out of reach,
so the dolphins try another technique.

18:13.027 --> 18:17.517
Vigorously pumping their tails,
they work up some speed

18:17.846 --> 18:20.183
and then, they hydroplane.

18:48.450 --> 18:55.159
Their momentum carries them right through
the shallowest waters, and onto the fish.

19:05.780 --> 19:09.483
Now they're in real danger of being stranded

19:09.904 --> 19:12.647
but fortune favors the brave.

19:21.156 --> 19:24.360
Younger dolphins lie alongside, watching

19:24.650 --> 19:27.773
but so far only eight individuals here

19:27.892 --> 19:30.886
have mastered this daring technique.

20:21.681 --> 20:27.261
Although most life in tropical waters
is concentrated around the coral reefs

20:27.326 --> 20:29.073
and the seagrass meadows,

20:29.256 --> 20:32.749
there are some spectacular exceptions.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.109
The desert of Bahrain
seems a very unlikely place

20:43.227 --> 20:46.943
to find a crowded bustling colony of seabirds

20:47.599 --> 20:53.981
But every year, a hundred thousand
socotra cormorants gather here to breed.

21:00.768 --> 21:02.462
It's swelteringly hot

21:02.698 --> 21:07.766
and only vigorous panting can prevent the birds
from fatal overheating.

21:08.554 --> 21:12.151
This hardly seems a good place to rear young

21:14.173 --> 21:17.967
but at least, there are no
land based predators here.

21:18.479 --> 21:21.972
The only source of trouble
is likely to be the neighbors

21:22.261 --> 21:26.739
so each nest is built
just beyond pecking reach

21:42.507 --> 21:44.450
But what about food?

21:44.922 --> 21:49.216
There's only bare sand
and the warm shallow sea beyond.

21:49.558 --> 21:55.571
Neither seem likely to produce enough
nourishment to support bird life on this scale.

21:59.745 --> 22:03.394
The answer is blowing in the wind.

22:05.377 --> 22:09.421
Sand whipped up by Shamals offshore winds

22:09.539 --> 22:12.835
blows into the seas of the Arabian Gulf.

22:13.295 --> 22:17.064
With the grains come nutrients,
which act as fertilizer

22:17.169 --> 22:21.738
and they transform the shallow sea
into a rich fishing ground

22:27.908 --> 22:33.436
So, paradoxically, it's the roasted
sands of Arabia that prevent the gulf

22:33.633 --> 22:37.112
from being another desert in the sea.

22:50.184 --> 22:53.630
The whale calf is now five months old.

22:53.851 --> 22:55.886
He's almost doubled in size

22:56.017 --> 22:59.995
and his days in his tropical nursery
are coming to an end.

23:00.455 --> 23:03.843
It has been a warm and safe place
in which to grow up

23:04.171 --> 23:07.426
but there's nothing to eat here
for his mother.

23:09.186 --> 23:13.794
She has been living off her fat reserves
for the last eight months

23:14.096 --> 23:16.367
and she's close to starving.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.847
She must leave now,
while she still has enough energy

23:19.848 --> 23:25.191
to guide and protect her calf,
on the long voyage ahead.

23:42.702 --> 23:47.692
All across the tropics,
humpbacks are heading away from the Equator

23:47.837 --> 23:54.139
towards the rich temperate seas of both
the southern and the northern hemispheres.

23:57.106 --> 24:02.410
These are colder, rougher,
and more dangerous waters.

24:14.491 --> 24:17.694
Mother and calf must stay close.

24:36.722 --> 24:41.038
They can send sound signals to one another,
above the roar of the ocean

24:41.301 --> 24:44.452
by slapping fins on the surface.

25:05.689 --> 25:11.449
In winter, the temperate seas
are lashed by violent storms.

25:29.120 --> 25:35.684
The turbulence stirs the water,
and draws nutrients up from the depths

25:43.983 --> 25:47.778
but nutrients alone can not support life.

25:48.578 --> 25:51.112
There must also be sunlight.

25:54.341 --> 25:58.490
In the spring, as the sun
daily climbs higher in the sky

25:58.727 --> 26:01.011
the algae start to grow.

26:01.917 --> 26:07.576
Blooms the size of the Amazon Rainforest
turn the seas green.

26:10.557 --> 26:13.340
Individually the algae are tiny

26:13.760 --> 26:20.049
but together, they produce three quarters
of all the oxygen in our atmosphere.

26:23.594 --> 26:27.664
They're eaten
by an array of bewildering creatures.

26:27.979 --> 26:31.051
Salps appear in the plankton soup.

26:36.816 --> 26:43.485
Individuals link together to form chains
which can stretch for fifteen meters.

26:53.870 --> 27:00.132
Pumping water through their bodies
they strain out algae and other edible particles.

27:10.938 --> 27:14.089
Comb jellies cruise through the water.

27:14.352 --> 27:17.647
They too flourish in this seasonal soup

27:17.884 --> 27:22.348
and for short periods, they appear
in astounding numbers.

27:23.372 --> 27:25.748
Krill, shrimp like creatures.

27:26.050 --> 27:29.333
By weight they're the most
abundant animals on the planet.

27:29.530 --> 27:33.744
A single swarm can contain
two million tons of them

27:42.699 --> 27:46.310
and that is a lot of fish food.

27:55.828 --> 28:01.107
The shallow temperate seas support
the greatest concentrations of fish on our planet.

28:01.633 --> 28:05.716
Huge shoals migrate from their
overwintering grounds in the depths

28:05.821 --> 28:08.802
to feed in these rich waters.

28:17.769 --> 28:23.690
It's these shoals that support most
of the world's sea mammals.

28:24.583 --> 28:29.821
Sea lions have all the agility and speed needed
to collect what they want

28:30.425 --> 28:33.655
and seemingly delight in doing so.

29:08.683 --> 29:12.963
Dusky dolphin,
often in pods two hundred strong

29:13.055 --> 29:15.563
work together to reap the harvest.

29:18.503 --> 29:24.530
They break up the shoals into smaller,
more manageable balls, and all the hunters benefit.

29:52.006 --> 29:56.838
By midsummer, the surface nutrients
have all been absorbed.

29:57.297 --> 30:01.853
The algae die
and the food chain collapses.

30:06.461 --> 30:08.877
In a few special places, however

30:08.992 --> 30:14.128
the temperate seas sustain these levels of life
throughout the summer.

30:14.554 --> 30:19.298
Along the coast of California,
ocean currents carry a constant supply

30:19.299 --> 30:23.104
of nutrients up from the depths
to the surface layers.

30:24.040 --> 30:30.653
These upwellings fertilize forests of giant kelp,
that thrive in the summer sunshine.

30:37.875 --> 30:41.978
The algal towers are
as high as a three story house

30:42.158 --> 30:45.867
and they can grow by half a meter a day.

31:00.161 --> 31:05.314
Life in the kelp is as full of drama,
as in any other forest

31:05.675 --> 31:08.613
but the cast is less familiar.

31:09.170 --> 31:13.421
An army of sea urchins is mounting an attack.

31:15.816 --> 31:22.972
The urchin plague strikes at the kelp's holdfasts
their crucial attachments to the rock.

31:37.628 --> 31:44.899
Holdfasts are extremely tough, but each
urchin has five teeth, which are self sharpening

31:45.110 --> 31:47.737
and are replaced every few months.

31:55.270 --> 31:58.865
Urchins fell vast areas of kelp forest

31:59.045 --> 32:03.820
creating clearings know as urchin barrens

32:06.775 --> 32:10.681
yet barrens is a poor description.

32:14.636 --> 32:18.788
Millions of invertebrates invade the seabed.

32:34.001 --> 32:37.283
The most fearsome predator here is a giant.

32:37.694 --> 32:45.029
The sunflower starfish is a meter across,
with an appetite for brittle stars.

33:03.066 --> 33:06.907
It uses it's feet to taste for prey.

33:11.962 --> 33:18.279
When it's actions are speeded up, it becomes clear
that the predator's fondness for the brittle stars

33:18.330 --> 33:23.811
is almost matched by the brittle stars
ability to get out of the way.

33:36.004 --> 33:41.715
Sand dollars flat sea urchins
cluster together as a defense

33:47.443 --> 33:52.005
But it doesn't seem to work
against the sunflower starfish.

33:52.416 --> 33:59.390
The predator extrudes it's stomach, and wraps it
around it's victims liquefying their soft parts.

34:00.310 --> 34:04.511
Nothing is left of them,
except their white skeletons.

34:11.764 --> 34:16.212
The Californian upwellings are seasonal
and relatively small

34:16.589 --> 34:19.313
but in Southern Africa they're so big

34:19.429 --> 34:25.516
they create seas rich enough to support
colonies of over a million seals.

34:30.391 --> 34:35.511
The Benguela Current sweeps along
the western coastline of Southern Africa

34:35.708 --> 34:39.730
driving nutrient rich waters up to the surface

34:41.123 --> 34:48.279
and then, at the southern tip of Africa it meets
the Agulhas Current, arriving from the east.

34:48.672 --> 34:52.201
The result: even richer waters.

35:04.001 --> 35:09.515
The seals here
thrive on a diet of fish and squid.

35:11.205 --> 35:16.523
In temperate seas there may actually
be more squid than fish.

35:23.957 --> 35:28.126
These are chokker squid,
and they lay their egg capsules

35:28.224 --> 35:33.525
in sandy shallows bathed by the warmer
Agulhas Current.

35:42.028 --> 35:46.507
Each capsule contains a hundred tiny squid.

35:51.808 --> 35:54.648
Within a few days
they develop spots of pigment

35:54.713 --> 35:59.357
which, when they're adult, they will use
to communicate with one another.

36:12.010 --> 36:15.030
With females continuing to lay eggs

36:15.031 --> 36:22.136
and males still preoccupied with repelling rivals,
the squid drop their guard.

36:25.746 --> 36:27.404
Stingray.

36:35.003 --> 36:39.647
Short tailed stingray
can be up to two meters across.

36:45.637 --> 36:51.167
They're the largest of all the stingrays,
and they have appetites to match.

37:20.264 --> 37:23.466
Another predator is on the prowl.

37:25.598 --> 37:29.357
The aptly named ragged tooth shark.

37:33.475 --> 37:40.040
Raggies grow to three meters long, but they share
these waters with a shark twice their size.

37:57.288 --> 38:00.111
The great white.

38:01.506 --> 38:05.378
The largest predatory fish on the planet.

38:12.025 --> 38:17.195
Each dawn cape fur seals leave their colony
to go fishing.

38:18.442 --> 38:22.626
To reach the open sea,
they must cross a narrow strip of water

38:23.381 --> 38:27.698
and that is patrolled by great whites.

38:36.823 --> 38:40.875
Each seal is indeed swimming for it's life.

39:04.246 --> 39:07.479
The shark relies on surprise.

40:08.644 --> 40:13.781
The great white's turn of speed
is powered by a high metabolism.

40:14.077 --> 40:17.130
They only thrive in cold temperate seas

40:17.131 --> 40:23.892
for only these waters contain sufficient food
necessary to fuel such a ravenous predator.

40:56.617 --> 41:00.507
As you travel towards the poles
north or south

41:00.590 --> 41:05.448
the colder, stormier seas
can become even richer.

41:07.286 --> 41:10.831
Midway between South Africa
and the South Pole

41:11.241 --> 41:14.901
lies the isolated island of Marion.

41:20.709 --> 41:24.698
The island sits in the infamous
"roaring forties"

41:24.812 --> 41:29.719
where incessant gale force winds
draw nutrients up from the depths

41:29.834 --> 41:33.510
ensuring plenty of food for king penguins.

41:36.563 --> 41:41.864
The kings are returning from a three day
fishing trip, with food for their chicks

41:42.094 --> 41:47.838
But first they must cross a crowded beach,
threading their way between gigantic

41:48.002 --> 41:51.513
and bad tempered elephant seals.

42:02.476 --> 42:05.791
The two hundred thousand penguins
breeding here

42:05.792 --> 42:09.287
are testament
to the richness of the fishing.

42:13.407 --> 42:17.149
King chicks are dependent on their mothers
for over a year

42:17.230 --> 42:21.481
and this puts a great deal
of pressure on the parents.

42:35.726 --> 42:42.389
Being flightless, the returning penguins
must cross the open beach on foot.

43:14.884 --> 43:19.513
Fur seals, that have come to the beach to breed,
are waiting for them.

43:27.949 --> 43:30.755
Fur seals normally live on krill

43:30.952 --> 43:36.828
but these have now acquired
an unexpected taste for blubber rich penguins.

44:29.608 --> 44:32.530
Penguins may be featherweights by comparison

44:32.727 --> 44:36.961
but they have razor sharp bills
and a feisty character.

44:40.030 --> 44:42.377
The seal could easily lose an eye.

44:42.541 --> 44:48.745
The only safe way to grab a penguin
is from behind, and the birds are well aware of that.

45:11.294 --> 45:14.116
Both animals are clumsy on this terrain

45:14.264 --> 45:17.038
but the penguin has the more to lose.

45:29.380 --> 45:30.841
Made it.

45:31.891 --> 45:35.255
Two out of three penguins
survive the seal attacks

45:35.320 --> 45:39.029
and succeed in reaching
their ever hungry chicks.

46:09.523 --> 46:14.070
The humpbacks are nearing the end
of their epic journeys.

46:19.486 --> 46:25.180
After two months and thousands of miles,
they're entering the polar seas

46:25.377 --> 46:28.677
both in the north and the south.

46:39.294 --> 46:46.221
In the far north, winter is over at last
and the ice is starting to melt.

46:50.142 --> 46:53.573
The Aleutian Island chain
running west from Alaska

46:53.785 --> 46:56.460
is the gateway to the Bearing Sea.

46:56.707 --> 47:03.682
With the retreating ice, rough weather
and ferocious currents stir up these shallow seas.

47:03.829 --> 47:08.720
Add sunshine and the mix
is spectacularly productive.

47:18.928 --> 47:25.558
Five million shearwaters have flown almost
ten thousand miles from Australia to get here.

47:26.330 --> 47:29.875
In all eighty million seabirds
come here for the summer

47:29.956 --> 47:34.797
the greatest concentration
to be found anywhere on Earth.

47:47.894 --> 47:51.456
The humpbacks have finally arrived.

48:10.642 --> 48:14.892
The giant shearwater flocks
hunt the krill swarms

48:14.925 --> 48:19.618
sometimes diving to depths
of forty meters to reach them.

48:43.169 --> 48:48.634
A large humpback
eats three tons of krill a day.

49:00.976 --> 49:05.325
The polar seas in summer
are the most productive on the planet

49:05.490 --> 49:09.166
and the whales gorge themselves
round the clock.

49:16.371 --> 49:21.689
The fat reserves they lay down now
will keep them alive during the year to come

49:23.248 --> 49:25.775
but it may not always be this way.

49:26.086 --> 49:29.484
Fish and krill stocks
are declining so rapidly

49:29.697 --> 49:34.342
that spectacles like this
may soon be part of history.

49:43.679 --> 49:49.720
Once the mother and calf have reached
their feeding grounds, they will separate.

49:52.820 --> 49:57.252
With luck, the calf will make
the epic journey across the oceans

49:57.285 --> 50:01.405
from equator to pole another seventy times

50:02.028 --> 50:05.656
cruising back and forth
between the shallow seas

50:06.000 --> 50:13.336
where life proliferates so abundantly
on our planet.
