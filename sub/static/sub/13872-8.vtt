00:06.006 --> 00:08.600
Gentlemen, behold.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.439
The thermostat.

00:13.446 --> 00:14.504
That's been there.

00:14.581 --> 00:18.540
Observe as I adjust the heat.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.759
- Is it on?
- You tell me.

00:30.597 --> 00:31.655
Wait.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.507
So, Shake...

01:17.577 --> 01:20.774
you are gonna take care of the bills
for us this month, aren't you?

01:20.847 --> 01:23.714
Yeah, absolutely. As soon as this is done.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.617
That's what you said
when the last show was on.

01:29.055 --> 01:32.650
The last show
was the popular lead-in, see.

01:32.859 --> 01:36.022
This is the show
the network wants me to watch...

01:36.096 --> 01:37.859
if you wouldn't mind.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.723
- But you are gonna do it today, right?
- Yes.

01:41.801 --> 01:44.463
How many times do I need to say yes
to get you to leave?

01:44.537 --> 01:46.061
'Cause it's getting late in the day.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.336
- The post office is gonna close soon.
- I know what it's gonna do.

01:49.409 --> 01:53.470
I've been around when they lock the doors.
Believe me, they close.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.741
Okay. As long as
you've got it taken care of.

01:55.815 --> 02:00.650
<i>Damn, Frylock, you falling
for that same shiznit again, baby.</i>

02:02.422 --> 02:04.083
Does it every time.

02:05.925 --> 02:10.362
- So, did you get those bills paid off?
- Yes, like you wouldn't believe.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.193
- All of them?
- Every single one of them.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.062
- Because there were four of them.
- I know.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.365
- I distinctly remember four.
- There were six of them!

02:17.437 --> 02:19.462
All right. Truth time.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.604
First thing tomorrow morning,
we crank it out...

02:23.676 --> 02:24.904
you and me together.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.379
- Shake, tomorrow is Sunday.
- You're right. Church.

02:29.582 --> 02:33.746
Monday morning,
we hit it hard, both guns blazing.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.756
Those bills will get paid so fast
they won't know what hit them.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.486
- There goes the cable. See?
- Terrorists.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.085
Recite to me
the number for the cable people.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.723
The service hot line
is on the bill that you never sent.

02:45.798 --> 02:49.666
Okay. Recite to me
the number for the excavators.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.728
Unless you want to go there
and dig up the septic tank yourself.

02:52.805 --> 02:56.764
- You flushed the cable bill down the toilet?
- All the bills. They're too expensive.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.141
You know how much money it takes
to heat this house?

02:59.212 --> 03:02.272
- Take a wild stab.
- Last month, $487.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.873
And that's a lot of money, isn't it?

03:04.951 --> 03:08.216
Hello, operator?
Give me the cable company, please.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.656
Are you listening to me?
Because I'm about to unload.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.895
- The phone's broken.
- Now it is.

03:17.964 --> 03:22.264
Do you understand why it's so important
to pay those bills we get every month?

03:22.335 --> 03:25.771
Look, we got electricity,
and we got each other.

03:28.141 --> 03:32.168
Look, we got each other.
What, are you gonna bill us for that now?

03:32.245 --> 03:34.975
You are about to learn
a lesson in responsibility.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.609
I'm responsible for getting us
into that club that one time.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.347
I smooth-talked that dude.
You saw me lay it down.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.582
Frankly, Shake, I can live like this.
You can't.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.783
If you don't pay,
we'll see how long it takes...

03:45.858 --> 03:50.158
- before you go out of your freaking mind.
- I'm not backing down on this, ever!

03:50.230 --> 03:51.288
Turn on the lights.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.832
I want you to see the look on my face.
Do you hear me?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.266
Or did they send a guy out
to shut off your ears...

03:56.336 --> 03:58.327
because I didn't pay the ear bill?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.167
Where the hell is the switch?

04:03.643 --> 04:06.544
- How come the shower ain't working?
- I don't know.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.480
Probably maybe something you did
to anger God.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.073
He's angry with you, all right.

04:11.150 --> 04:14.085
I remember him telling me that
at The Last Supper.

04:14.153 --> 04:16.053
Yeah, they had good fish there.

04:16.122 --> 04:19.091
- You didn't pay the water bill, did you?
- Or the electricity.

04:19.158 --> 04:22.059
That's why you gotta do it.
You're my main man.

04:22.128 --> 04:25.029
- I am?
- Everybody knows. I say it to many people.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.622
I knew you'd come around to me.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.396
Here, hop on the TV
and await further instructions.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.768
I will not fail you. Wolverines!

04:32.839 --> 04:34.363
That's not gonna work, Shake.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.967
Oh, God, always with the negatives,
like a big zero.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.810
- And that's why you're not my main man.
- Yeah, I'm the main man.

04:41.881 --> 04:44.975
That's right, main man.
Now move to the left. It's still black.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.211
- Here?
- Move further back.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.548
- How about there?
- Still black.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.417
- How about this?
- I think I see something.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.581
- Is this...
- Too far.

04:50.657 --> 04:54.286
Shake, the electricity is gone, remember?
We didn't pay for it.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.920
Now the TV's gone. How about that?

04:56.996 --> 05:00.898
There's just one simple thing you gotta do
to make all this go away.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.959
- And you know what that is, don't you?
- You're right.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.061
- Hey, Carl.
- What?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.163
You think I can borrow a...

05:07.874 --> 05:08.863
Come in.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.709
Is this a blooper show?
I love these. Watch this.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.712
See the guy in the cap right there?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.010
He's gonna get whacked in the groin
by the fish.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.573
Maybe the fish will bite the groin.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.115
Wait a minute. This is a fishing show, Carl.

05:22.188 --> 05:26.784
- I don't remember ever saying "come in".
- I know. It's unspoken between us.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.089
We got a vibe going.
You know what I mean?

05:29.162 --> 05:32.188
So you go get those pretzels,
'cause I know you're thinking it.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.962
Yeah, you read my mind there.
Guess where the pretzels are?

05:36.035 --> 05:39.129
Think. We got a vibe. Inside my gun.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.400
Now where did that come from?

05:41.741 --> 05:44.835
All right, look, let's just take a step back...

05:45.411 --> 05:46.935
breathe deep...

05:47.246 --> 05:49.737
and let's go get me those pretzels.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.547
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

05:54.620 --> 05:57.646
Paying the bills.
I ain't got my blender to work all morning.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.716
- I need me a weenie smoothie.
- No, Meatwad. Shake's gotta do it.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.988
He needs to learn a lesson
about responsibility.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.189
You need to teach me a lesson
about money.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.596
Look at this here. I was gonna send this.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.828
No one works in the system that I use.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.894
Why don't you put all this back
in your little pine straw bank?

06:12.972 --> 06:15.497
Bank? No, that's my IRA.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.338
I use the bank,
I get burned on capital gains tax.

06:20.513 --> 06:23.676
- What was that?
- Oh, man. I guess it finally happened.

06:25.585 --> 06:26.916
What's the matter?

06:26.986 --> 06:31.320
Somebody wants to get a little piece
of electrified fluorescent lighting.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.386
Here's a taste. Now get lost.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.825
- I heard gunshots. Are you okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.453
I'm a guest in this home.

06:37.530 --> 06:40.021
Why don't you go back
to the time before Christ...

06:40.099 --> 06:42.329
a.k.a. next door, your house.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.699
And the gunshots didn't mean a thing.

06:46.539 --> 06:50.305
- God.
- I know. It's another bass fishing show.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.942
Two in one day.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.037
- How lucky are we, right?
- I didn't think it was loaded.

06:55.114 --> 06:59.278
- I just sort of checking the barrel there...
- And it went off in your hand.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.313
I know. I was there.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.821
Why do you think
I cranked up the volume?

07:03.890 --> 07:05.881
You know, hearing does not come back.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.949
It degrades over time.

07:08.027 --> 07:11.360
Just do something, okay?
Just call the doctor or something.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.695
- I'll do it, I will.
- Do it now!

07:14.167 --> 07:15.259
You're scaring the fish.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.826
Work, please. Go. PurÃ©e.

07:18.905 --> 07:22.204
- I can't believe Shake's still there.
- Has he learned his lesson yet?

07:22.275 --> 07:26.268
Please tell me he has,
'cause this is getting old over here. Blend!

07:26.345 --> 07:29.473
I'm sure that he'll come around
and maybe even learn something.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.676
- Just give it a few more hours.
- A few hours?

07:31.751 --> 07:34.447
Look here, I'm getting hungry and thirsty.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.114
Usually by now
I'd be on my fifth weenie smoothie.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.317
Guess how many I've had? Zero.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.519
Those weenies
are spoiled by now, Meatwad.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.495
- The fridge hasn't worked for a day.
- I don't keep them there.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.998
I age them on the windowsill...

07:47.066 --> 07:50.160
so that when they get all sticky
and slimy and smelling bad...

07:50.236 --> 07:52.864
like they's rotten,
that's when they's getting good.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.907
- Really?
- Let me go off topic here for a bit.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.101
Know how much protein's
in a weenie smoothie?

07:57.176 --> 07:58.541
- No.
- Zero. Blend.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.580
I don't care how much you talk
to that blender. It won't work.

08:01.647 --> 08:06.175
Hell, we ought to make one manually.
I'm about to lose my freaking mind.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.216
- Meatwad, no.
- Meatwad, yes. Are you seeing this?

08:13.292 --> 08:16.284
- Little busy looking at this blood...
- He's an inch from death.

08:16.362 --> 08:20.196
- I'm losing lots of blood here.
- Relax. You got plenty there, big guy.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.100
- You need the phone.
- Yes, thank you.

08:24.170 --> 08:28.368
I guessed it. What did I say?
Do we have a vibe, or what?

08:29.642 --> 08:30.768
You need a doctor?

08:30.843 --> 08:33.038
- Yes, please.
- It's ringing.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.443
- Oh, God.
- Hello, Dr. Cheesesteak?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.075
- We require one sandwich...
- I'm gonna blow you away.

08:38.150 --> 08:42.280
...with 40 ccs of cheese steak, stat,
with an infusion of medical sauce.

08:42.421 --> 08:45.151
Hold, please. Carl? Yellow peppers?

08:45.224 --> 08:49.320
- Help me, please! My foot!
- No yellow peppers for his.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.987
Okay, thank you.

08:51.063 --> 08:54.829
See, Carl? I got your backside, buddy.
Now, look, it's gonna be $12.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.027
All right, look at that.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.129
- Meatwad.
- Did you want one? Hang on a sec.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.401
- No, Meatwad. Shut it off.
- Make me one.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.773
- Call the doctor, please!
- Carl?

09:04.844 --> 09:06.937
- Don't encourage him.
- What happened to him?

09:07.013 --> 09:10.505
Shoots himself in the foot
and thinks the world's gotta stop for him.

09:10.583 --> 09:14.110
- We're still turning, baby.
- Back away. Let me look at it.

09:14.186 --> 09:17.383
You mean so you can come in
and have a nice glass of water.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.687
I wasn't born yesterday, okay?
I've seen movies.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.285
- He needs medical attention.
- Yes, I do.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.853
He needs an upgrade
from his satellite provider...

09:25.932 --> 09:28.298
'cause if I see one more redneck
spit into a lake...

09:28.367 --> 09:31.461
I'll be forced to get up
and change the channel.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.696
- My foot.
- Listen, I know it hurts, man...

09:33.773 --> 09:35.741
but I need to keep your foot elevated...

09:35.808 --> 09:38.606
- Oh, hell.
- That's not mine, is it?

09:38.678 --> 09:42.079
That's bad, isn't it?
Look, you need to get that on ice.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.208
At the hospital, with the hospital's ice.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.912
Carl, calm down. Listen. Look.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.785
- We'll be there in a couple of hours, okay?
- No!

09:53.392 --> 09:55.360
Damn, Carl, you look stupid.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.956
Yeah, my HMO guy didn't know
how to approach this, so he did this.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.262
Do a headstand for me. Get it?

10:02.802 --> 10:05.862
Yeah. I gotta tell you, I don't.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.565
I mean, look at these horse pills.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.803
- I'm frigging wasted here.
- You got ripped?

10:10.876 --> 10:12.309
Seriously, though, I'd be pissed.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.710
You'd think that,
but something about these pills...

10:14.780 --> 10:16.975
they take the edge off, you know?

10:17.049 --> 10:20.177
Take four of them
and that yellow gateway over there...

10:20.252 --> 10:22.117
opens for the dwarf man.

10:22.188 --> 10:25.157
- Do you want to go over there with me...
- No, thank you.

10:25.224 --> 10:28.660
I want as little to do with you as possible.
Now please leave my sight.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.460
I didn't think you'd do it,
but you paid the bills.

10:31.530 --> 10:34.727
Hell, no. I pay no bills. I pay you no mind.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.166
Come on, the TV's about to come on.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.599
I'm just glad that you
finally accepted some responsibility...

10:41.674 --> 10:43.665
in the most ass way possible.

10:43.943 --> 10:46.912
Come here. This here's funny.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.080
Bad wiring, my friend.

10:49.148 --> 10:53.141
And if you tell the insurance people that...
But stick to it. Don't waffle.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.983
I'm fairly confident they will drop you.

10:56.055 --> 10:59.024
You can stay with us, Carl,
as long as you have those pills.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.060
- Thank you, Daddy.
- You found it. That's the guest bedroom.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.995
And you know,
if you need to go to the bathroom...

11:05.064 --> 11:06.691
- you know, just do it.
- Shake.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.200
Don't mess with him, okay.
He's had a long day.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.668
You need anything else?
There's some ants.
