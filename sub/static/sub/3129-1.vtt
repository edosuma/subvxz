Armstrong-Parker, that's
your housing assignment?

Traditionally it's where the

06:01.240 --> 06:03.891

So, what house
did you get?

06:31.040 --> 06:34.931
Oh, Bechet, bitch.
Of course.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.884
<i>The mere thought of a
Fletcher anywhere else</i>

06:38.000 --> 06:39.286
Oh, easy.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.725
It was the luck
of the draw.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.450
Daddy had nothing
to do with it.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.603
Besides, if I had to
pick anywhere to be,

06:45.680 --> 06:47.011
it would be here.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.969
Well, I'm down
to switch.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.203

<i>Do you want

<i>I want you

07:16.520 --> 07:18.522
Babe, Head of House

07:18.600 --> 07:20.364
Well, I should

07:20.440 --> 07:22.522
Thanks, Sof.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.251
Bye.
Bye.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.687
So, babe, you think I got
time for a quick cut?

07:27.800 --> 07:29.040
You just got it
cut last week.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.770
It's a black thing, babe.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.366
(Sofia) Since when is
OCD a black thang?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.522
(Troy) Babe, please don't
say “thang” like that.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.723
(Sofia) Besides, you have a shift
over at the Politicos booth

07:38.800 --> 07:40.564
and then you have
a shift at Orientation

07:40.640 --> 07:42.881
and then your advisor
is coming over.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.567
<i>(Troy) Okay, you know what?
I'll just wear a hat.</i>

07:46.640 --> 07:50.167
And then a movie maybe?
Just us?

07:50.280 --> 07:52.362
Election night.
Babe, come on.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.726

07:53.800 --> 07:55.404
<i>(Troy)

Yo, Kurt!

All right!

08:01.880 --> 08:03.405
Hey, sis.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.841
Is she kidding
with this?

08:11.920 --> 08:14.526
You don't have to run again. Just
because it's her doesn't mean...

08:14.600 --> 08:17.763
<i>Babe, I can't let Sam and her wannabe
Black Panthers take the house.</i>

08:17.840 --> 08:20.446
The house needs me,
who I am.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.289
It's who he
wants you to be.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.931
So you take a couple of
psych classes and now

08:25.000 --> 08:26.560
all of a sudden,
you think you're Freud?

08:26.600 --> 08:29.080
Oh, a Freud reference?
Sophisticated.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.246
<i>(Troy) Okay. Beck, Jung, Maslow.</i>

08:34.320 --> 08:36.322

<i>(Sam, over mic) Dear white

09:46.720 --> 09:50.566
<i>(Troy) Yes? Someone
else is running?</i>

09:50.640 --> 09:54.361
Just because we're colored don't
mean we run on colored people time.

09:54.440 --> 09:59.002
Boycotting hot combs don't make you
an expert on colored people, Boo.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.243
I care about each and
every single one of you.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.561
I care about this house.

you, Troy Fairbanks.</i>

10:17.880 --> 10:20.565
Is this
because of us?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.967
Because we broke up
over a year ago. Hm.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.122
You seriously think you can win?

10:25.200 --> 10:28.044
Troy, we live in a world where
there's a Big Mama's House 3.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.205
I don't think I have a chance in hell.
Thank God.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.243

Troy, my brother,

that Armstrong-Parker,

11:02.440 --> 11:04.727
the bastion
of black culture here,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.404
was gutted

11:06.480 --> 11:07.891
<i>by the Randomization
of Housing Act.</i>

11:07.960 --> 11:09.530
<i>Now, second years of color</i>

11:09.600 --> 11:11.489
no longer have a say
in where they go.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.210
The culture
that's been fostered

11:13.280 --> 11:14.930
in this house
for two decades

11:15.000 --> 11:17.082
will be wiped
out in two years.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.243
<i>This wasn't motivated by a
desire to mix things up,</i>

11:20.320 --> 11:23.722
<i>bring about racial

11:23.800 --> 11:25.689
<i>The black kids

11:25.760 --> 11:27.444
<i>in the proverbial cafeteria</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:30.126
so they must be up to no good.
Yeah! Mm-hm.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.807
Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations,

11:33.920 --> 11:36.491
political leanings,
majors, you name it.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.289
Black kids
get their own house

11:38.360 --> 11:40.601
and suddenly we got a problem?

11:40.720 --> 11:42.961
<i>This doesn't effect the other
houses like it does ours.</i>

11:43.040 --> 11:45.930
There are plenty of trustees,
former coaches,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.002
presidents watching
out for the others

11:48.080 --> 11:50.242

would rather please his massa

The Black Student Union and I

12:05.520 --> 12:08.683
I plan on bringing it to
the President and together

12:08.760 --> 12:11.969

Yes!

got a winner.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.404
Sam White?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.882
Oh, shit.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.166
Congratulations.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.002
So that's what
you're looking for?

13:17.080 --> 13:20.448
<i>I just want to make
good TV, sweetheart.</i>

13:20.520 --> 13:22.124
Well, I think
I'd be good TV.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
You're getting a great
education at a great school.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.569
Why don't you just be good at that.
I am.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.723
And when I graduate early with an
economics degree from Winchester,

13:34.800 --> 13:36.484
it'll be
the crowning achievement

13:36.560 --> 13:38.688
of my black middle class
parents' ambitions.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.127
Yeah, well, conflict is
a commodity in my industry.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.441
Sam has that.
Do you?

13:43.520 --> 13:46.922
<i>So, what? You want
me to start a fight?</i>

13:47.000 --> 13:50.209
I don't want you to do anything
you wouldn't otherwise do.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.285
<i>(voicemail voice) Hey, you
reached Garmin House,</i>

13:59.400 --> 14:01.607

14:05.360 --> 14:07.044
<i>That's right, hunty,

14:07.120 --> 14:09.930
<i>The less you have

14:10.000 --> 14:11.161

14:21.640 --> 14:25.042
Third time's a charm, right?

14:25.120 --> 14:28.044
<i>What about
Armstrong-Parker?</i>

14:28.120 --> 14:29.326
I don't know if that's...

14:29.400 --> 14:31.323
I might have an opening.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.925
That might be good
for you to be around...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.810
Dean, the worst thing
about high school

14:35.880 --> 14:37.644
and believe me,
it's a long list,

14:37.720 --> 14:41.691
were the black kids.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.331
Maybe it's in your head, son.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.166
Sure, folks can be intolerant
around people like you.

14:48.320 --> 14:54.168
And homosexuals just...
I... I don't believe in labels.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.561
You like jazz, Lionel?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.847
<i>Winchester is like jazz.</i>

14:59.000 --> 15:02.368
It's a research school.
And <i>jazz</i> is tension-

15:02.440 --> 15:07.526
The interplay
of improvised solos,

15:07.600 --> 15:11.241
<i>all creating one song.</i>

15:11.320 --> 15:13.766
<i>Your problem is you've
got no instrument.</i>

15:13.840 --> 15:17.970
<i>No major, no affiliations,
no solo, son.</i>

15:18.040 --> 15:19.840
<i>I submit articles

15:19.880 --> 15:21.848
<i>No one reads
the Independent Observer.</i>

15:21.920 --> 15:24.685
My point is are you
playing swing or bebop?

15:24.760 --> 15:26.205
You're mixing
your metaphors.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.004
Are you a sax
or are you a trumpet?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.491
I don't like jazz.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.881
[sigh]

15:31.960 --> 15:35.851
Look, <i>I'll</i> do what I can.

15:35.920 --> 15:39.402
But not a word of this
in the Observer, okay?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.811
No one reads it, right?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.326

16:31.480 --> 16:33.528
<i>George. We had Civ last semester.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.080

Fan of your stuff

16:37.840 --> 16:40.081
No one reads
the Observer.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.208
Have you seen this?

16:42.280 --> 16:43.805
The residents
of Armstrong-Parker

16:43.880 --> 16:45.689
<i>just made her
head of house.</i>

16:45.760 --> 16:48.923
Am I crazy or is
there a there there?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.049
What made you come
over here? I mean,

16:52.120 --> 16:54.160
<i>it's not like I didn't... I'm

16:54.240 --> 16:56.322
My staff.
God bless them.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.721
They are whiter
than Michael Jackson's kids.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.087
I mean, we're fucked
if anyone of them

17:01.160 --> 17:02.605

I won't let the transfers</i>

17:02.680 --> 17:04.011

17:04.079 --> 17:05.809
Well, this one
has his face.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.126
You're in
the Black Student Union.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.690
You probably know Sam.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.125
You come up
with a good angle,

17:10.200 --> 17:11.406
I want it
in the Bugle.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.005
Trumpet.
Bugle. Focus.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.809
The only paper
on campus

17:14.880 --> 17:16.882
<i>with</i> an <i>advisor
with The New York Times.</i>

17:16.960 --> 17:19.611
Only so many ways a person
can distinguish themselves

17:19.680 --> 17:21.170
at a place
like this, Lionel.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.642
You're good.
You belong with us.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.960
Did you get it?

17:46.040 --> 17:47.485
<i>Good.</i>

17:47.560 --> 17:49.767
You've now got
the shared calendar,

17:49.880 --> 17:52.008

and official email.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.006
And before I forget.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.611
Event requests for the year?
Just this month.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.762
They all need
your approval.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.922
And don't forget
to pick your office hours.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.684
You need
at least 20 per week.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.683
That's absurd.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.444
[laugh]

18:14.520 --> 18:17.524
Well, you're now head
of a hundred residents.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.524
And they all need time to
complain to your face about...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.443
noise, leaky pipes,

18:22.520 --> 18:24.045
<i>gluten-free option
in the cafeteria, etc.</i>

18:24.120 --> 18:27.886
Troy, I didn't think
I was gonna win.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.282
Look, I'm late

18:34.360 --> 18:36.647
<i>By the way,

18:40.560 --> 18:42.608
<i>None of the other houses

18:42.680 --> 18:45.081
Because they all have a legacy
of rich and powerful allies

18:45.160 --> 18:47.731
who will make sure that “random”
works to their advantage.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.849
<i>And you really think a petition
is going to change that?</i>

18:58.080 --> 19:01.687

19:09.480 --> 19:10.481
Hello?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.448
Yeah.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.727
Okay, well, just call me the
minute there's an update.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.164
<i>(Sam, off) The
Armstrong-Parker dining hall</i>

19:28.240 --> 19:29.969
<i>is the epicenter

<i>and discuss everything

19:48.440 --> 19:50.204

19:50.280 --> 19:51.770
You are begging

19:51.840 --> 19:53.604
Good thing
the one evil techno-genius

19:53.680 --> 19:55.284
thinking like that
is on my side.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.964
We was robbed.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.849
That election
was suspect, man.

Cute. You get that

but I don't see
what the point is

20:19.720 --> 20:21.722
in blaming white folks
for everything.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.491
Who's blaming, Blue Eyes? I
really don't see the issue.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.450
Never had one. Never ran
into any lynch mobs.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.841
<i>(Sam) Lynch mob's still here.
Just re-branded itself.</i>

20:29.920 --> 20:32.969

20:33.040 --> 20:34.929
You want to know how

20:35.000 --> 20:36.650
<i>You go to a Young
Republican's meeting</i>

20:36.720 --> 20:38.131
and bring up welfare.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.283
Or Immigration.
Or gay rights.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.407
Bullshit.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.481
You have
something to add?

20:45.560 --> 20:47.483
Me? Yeah, I do.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.001
Look, your biggest

<i>Hell, guys,

20:54.960 --> 20:56.962
Okay, sometimes I think

20:57.040 --> 20:59.361
in the American
work force right now

20:59.440 --> 21:01.727
is an educated

[laugh]
You're not serious?

21:04.320 --> 21:06.607
Hey look, you guys still
got affirmative action,

21:06.680 --> 21:08.648

I'm saying.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.530
I'm sorry, what exactly
are you doing here?

21:11.600 --> 21:14.649
All right, check this out.
You ready? Obama, right?

21:14.720 --> 21:16.961
Leader of the free world.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.362
He gets into Harvard
based on... You!

21:20.440 --> 21:23.091
Too late.
Affirmative action.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.050
You know who's not
president right now? No?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.009
The guy who didn't get in.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.607
Well, on behalf of all the
colored folks in the room

21:31.680 --> 21:33.921
let me apologize to all the
better qualified white students

21:34.000 --> 21:35.331
whose place
we're taking up.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.323
No, it's fine.
We're okay.

<i>I'm sorry,

21:39.400 --> 21:41.368
Bechet is that way.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.442
Oh, I know where it is. I'm
actually supposed to eat there.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.285
This is the only dining hall
that you can actually

21:46.360 --> 21:48.886
get yourself some
chicken and waffles.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.564
[laughing]

21:50.640 --> 21:54.247
Look, you're
Dear White People, right?

21:54.320 --> 21:55.731
It's funny.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.211
It's funny stuff,
it really is.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.089
How have we
not staffed you yet?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.049
Oh, me?
Oh what?

22:01.120 --> 22:03.805
On Pastiche, your
uninspired humor magazine?

22:03.880 --> 22:06.360
<i>It's actually much more than
just a magazine, sweetheart.</i>

22:06.440 --> 22:09.091
<i>SNL staff is basically half
Lampoon, half Pastiche.</i>

Same goes
for the network comedies.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.609
And what gives you
clubhouse kids

22:12.680 --> 22:15.286
the right to come
to our dining hall?

22:15.360 --> 22:16.600
You don't live here.

22:16.680 --> 22:17.841
Sam, what
are you doing?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.649
So, you
can't eat here.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.801
Chill, Sam. Damn, all right?
Let the man...

22:20.880 --> 22:23.008
Got this.
Got this.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.764
Look, who are you
to throw me out?

22:24.840 --> 22:29.050
Oh! Well, I think
I'm head of this house.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.685
And I'm doing
things my way.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.609
Your way.
[nonsense fear sound]

22:39.160 --> 22:40.605
Excuse me.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.365
[groans and laughter]

22:47.360 --> 22:49.806
Serious question.
Do you know who I am?

22:49.880 --> 22:51.723
<i>Yeah, I know your dad
is the president. Good.</i>

22:51.800 --> 22:53.643
<i>He's the same one
that has been pushing</i>

22:53.720 --> 22:55.848
<i>to break up this
house for a decade.</i>

22:55.920 --> 22:58.241
What's wrong? Is he afraid that
letting the negros gather in groups

22:58.320 --> 23:01.005
might start a little
rebellion on his plantation?

23:01.080 --> 23:05.324
Oh, well, then you tell him
from me, that he should be.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.968
Yeah.
Bad move.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.441
<i>(Kurt)

23:15.520 --> 23:17.204
(Kurt)
Excuse me. Sorry.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.203
[laughing]

23:19.280 --> 23:21.203
Excuse us.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.841
[laughing]

23:24.920 --> 23:27.207
Uhhh...

23:27.280 --> 23:29.851
You too.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.288
Me? Yeah, I'm sorry.
Do you live here?

23:51.480 --> 23:53.369
She the man.
She the man.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.330
[clapping]

23:56.400 --> 23:58.767

(Helmut) Yeah, well, conflict

24:46.040 --> 24:48.088
Sam has that.
Do you?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.367
Welcome, muffins.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.442
So, I hate
to do it to you

24:57.520 --> 25:00.046
but I'm gonna have to get real
black with you for a second.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.681
So the other day, a girl had
the nerve to fix her mouth

25:03.760 --> 25:06.491
and ask me if my
hair was weaved.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.086
Weaved?
Really, bitch?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.924
First of all, if you're
going to fix your mouth

25:11.000 --> 25:12.604
to ask me
something like that,

25:12.680 --> 25:15.445
say it right, please?
It's weave.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.251
Noun. Present tense.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.004
Second of all,
don't assume

25:20.120 --> 25:21.963
just because you see
a sister with some hair

25:22.080 --> 25:24.367
that it's a weave.
Is it?

25:24.440 --> 25:27.171
If a bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out of her own head,

25:27.240 --> 25:29.686
she wouldn't have just overdrafted
her account paying for this shit

25:29.760 --> 25:31.410
but that ain't
your business, Boo-Boo.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.244
Are those your lips, sweetie?

25:33.320 --> 25:35.402
Is that really your skin?

25:35.480 --> 25:37.005
These white girls
and their tans,

25:37.080 --> 25:39.765
they're starting
to get darker than me

25:39.840 --> 25:42.207
which isn't that dark.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.402
Dear white people,
what do I think about it?

25:59.760 --> 26:02.525
<i>[silent movie music]</i>

26:39.320 --> 26:41.687

26:56.040 --> 26:58.725
Okay. Anyone have
any comments

26:58.800 --> 27:01.644
for Sam's “Rebirth
of a Nation?”

27:05.840 --> 27:09.049
Could I?
Gabe, go ahead.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.804
<i>(Gabe) I dig the
silent movie thing,</i>

27:10.880 --> 27:12.609

a little self-congratulatory.</i>

27:12.680 --> 27:14.045
Light on story

27:14.120 --> 27:16.521
and frankly
thematically dubious.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.931
<i>(professor)

27:18.000 --> 27:20.810
[chatter]

27:20.880 --> 27:22.211

27:22.280 --> 27:23.770
Before you say anything

27:23.840 --> 27:25.569
might I remind you
that I sat through

27:25.640 --> 27:27.130
<i>A Birth of a Nation,
Gone with the Wind,</i>

27:27.200 --> 27:29.168
and Tarantino week
without protest.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.163
Yeah, and might I also
remind you that I read

27:31.240 --> 27:34.289
your entire 15 page,
unsolicited treatise

27:34.360 --> 27:35.964
on why the Gremlins
is actually about

27:36.040 --> 27:37.849
suburban white fear
of black culture.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.888
The gremlins are loud,
talk in slang,

27:39.960 --> 27:41.564
are addicted
to fried chicken,

27:41.680 --> 27:44.001
and freak out
when you get their hair wet.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.128
<i>The only problem that I have with
your film is that it was late.</i>

27:46.200 --> 27:47.725
The silent projects
were last semester.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.723
<i>You were supposed
to e-mail me</i>

27:49.800 --> 27:50.926
<i>your sound treatment

27:51.000 --> 27:52.445
<i>I have radio, BSU,</i>

27:52.520 --> 27:53.760
now this Head of House thing.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.888
Okay, do you want this?

27:55.960 --> 27:59.123
Look, this thing might as
well be my right hand.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.770
I was busy this summer.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.365
Your peers are out
getting internships,

28:02.440 --> 28:05.330
making short films.
My dad was sick.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.845
I had to go home.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.684
<i>If you need time,
take it.</i>

28:08.760 --> 28:10.205
But if you want
to be here next semester...

28:10.280 --> 28:12.089
<i>I do.
Pull if together!</i>

28:12.160 --> 28:13.525
<i>This is Winchester.</i>

28:23.520 --> 28:25.443
Thematically dubious.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.287
<i>(Gabe) Well, what was that
supposed to be about exactly?</i>

28:30.360 --> 28:32.408
<i>(Sam)
You're thematically dubious!</i>

28:35.400 --> 28:37.448
Since when do TA's
give critiques?

28:37.520 --> 28:39.807
You invoke minstrelsy for
shock value, to what end?

28:39.880 --> 28:42.087
To invoke the same feeling I
get when I turn on the TV

28:42.160 --> 28:45.209
and see some so-called reality
star shuck and jive for ratings

28:45.280 --> 28:47.521
egged on by no doubt
white producers.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.409
Or the sassy
black secretary

28:49.480 --> 28:51.164
who has no backstory
or character development

28:51.240 --> 28:52.605
aside from her skin color.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.808
<i>So it's a tit
for tat?</i>

28:54.920 --> 28:56.888
<i>Are you honestly saying that
art can't be reactionary?</i>

28:56.960 --> 28:58.920
You're reacting to something
that's 100 years old.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.405
Because fear of black men
involved in U.S. government

29:00.480 --> 29:02.244
is a completely
antiquated concept.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.243
No social relevance today.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.685
I think that sometimes
you should hold

29:05.760 --> 29:07.728
a mirror up
to your audience

29:07.800 --> 29:09.802
rather than dropping an
ideological piano on their head.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.042
I just think that works that
deal with the African Diaspora

29:12.120 --> 29:14.168
through a post-modern lens
are outright rejected

29:14.240 --> 29:15.890
unless handled
by a white artist.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.531
<i>African Diaspora?
Yeah, I said it.</i>

29:18.600 --> 29:21.524
<i>I'm sorry, but blackface is
alive and well in our culture.</i>

29:21.600 --> 29:23.250
<i>Who primarily buys
hip hop,</i>

29:23.320 --> 29:25.448
watches Housewives
of Atlanta <i>?</i>

29:25.520 --> 29:29.127
The same homogenized images of
black people over and over again?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.690
White people, Gabe.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.125
Who goes to see
Tyler Perry movies?

29:32.200 --> 29:34.043
We're an underfed community.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.043
None of this changes the
fact that the vibrancy,

29:36.120 --> 29:38.168
the complexity of black
culture has been distilled

29:38.240 --> 29:40.163
into commodities and marketing
schemes to be bought and sold.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.208
To the detriment of the so
called “real thing.” Got it.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.521
<i>(Sam) It means that I
am indistinguishable</i>

29:44.600 --> 29:46.807
from the so called
“urban” images

29:46.880 --> 29:49.326
<i>of black folks used to amuse
and market to white America.</i>

29:49.440 --> 29:52.125
And the commodification of culture is
uniquely oppressive to black people? Mm-hm.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.123
So when Kanye raps
about Louis V

29:54.200 --> 29:55.964

29:56.040 --> 29:58.088

our motto is a euphemism

38:01.040 --> 38:04.044
Well, Dad, the Housing Act passing
without a fight didn't help.

38:04.120 --> 38:07.283
And what did I tell you
about excuses?

38:07.360 --> 38:10.045
Pops, my course load
is full anyway.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.771
I'm head of Econ. Board,

38:12.840 --> 38:15.810
plus, I'm uh...

38:15.880 --> 38:19.521
I'm thinking
about joining Pastiche.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.246
Pastiche. Yeah, you know,
to help round out the rest.

38:22.360 --> 38:26.046
On Kurt Fletcher's staff.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.202
I'll be goddamned
if after 20 years...

38:28.280 --> 38:30.567
<i>you're working
for that dumb-ass's son.</i>

38:30.640 --> 38:32.404
Yes, sir.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.847
<i>Fletcher and I
graduated one year apart.</i>

38:34.920 --> 38:37.207
He barely made it through.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.806
I graduated summa cum laude.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.968
Now who is president
and who is dean?

38:42.040 --> 38:43.929
What's the difference?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.401
Oh, a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, for starters.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.848
<i>Understand
what I'm saying?</i>

38:49.920 --> 38:53.163
What happened between you and Sam
that she's coming after you now?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.243
Sophia.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.970
<i>I mean, you do remember
Sophia, don't you,</i>

38:59.040 --> 39:00.883
daughter of the president,
Psych. major,

39:00.960 --> 39:02.291
"Has the whole world
ahead of her, Troy"?

39:02.400 --> 39:04.880
Watch your tone.
Sorry, sir.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.811
So you lost the house.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.445
Onto the school presidency.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.249
<i>It would be good to show
that the campus</i>

39:16.320 --> 39:19.847
is capable of electing
someone like you...

39:19.960 --> 39:21.121
as school president.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.171
Someone like me.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.083
Someone like you.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.527
[laughs]

39:51.520 --> 39:53.648
Hey, Babe,
hat or no hat?

39:55.840 --> 39:57.842
Are you wearing that?

39:57.920 --> 39:59.251
I don't have to be.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.123
Hey, Boo.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.567
How about we put

40:04.640 --> 40:08.087
some of your newfound
free time to good use, hm?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.889
It's been a while since we...

40:09.960 --> 40:11.849
What is with
all this "Boo" stuff?

40:11.920 --> 40:13.720
Since you fucked me
with your big, black cock.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.647
It used to turn you on
when I talked like that.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.609
<i>Is it me?</i>

40:20.680 --> 40:23.365
Sweetheart, I love you.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.165
Is it Sam?
Can we please just get ready?

40:26.240 --> 40:28.811
Why? I hate
my brother's friends.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.769
So you're not going with me.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.001
<i>You'd go without me?</i>

40:32.080 --> 40:34.481
But... you're my guest.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.210
I mean, you could
just hang out here and I'll...

40:36.280 --> 40:38.248
<i>What is it
with you and my brother?</i>

40:38.320 --> 40:39.606
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

40:39.680 --> 40:43.048
Is this some, like, DL shit?

40:43.120 --> 40:44.326
DL shit?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.729
Wait, Sophia, hold on.
Just stay.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.126
No, I'm not going.
All right, I'll go with you.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.129
No.
<i>I'll-</i> I'll go with you.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.249
[door closes]
Sophia?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.766
<i>[woman] Oh, my God.
He did not.</i>

40:56.880 --> 40:58.405
<i>[man] Oh, he did.
You</i> are so crazy.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.686
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

40:59.760 --> 41:04.129
[chatting in distance]

41:04.200 --> 41:06.931
<i>[woman]
I could do better.</i>

41:07.000 --> 41:09.606
Shh, wait, wait.
Quiet. Wait, wait.
I want to watch this.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.604
<i>If a bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out of her own head,</i>

41:12.680 --> 41:14.887
<i>she wouldn't have just overdrafted
her account paying for this shit...</i>

41:14.960 --> 41:16.450
<i>but that ain't
your business, Boo-Boo.</i>

41:16.520 --> 41:19.205
Oh, my God.
l am so sharing this.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.725
<i>Send me the link.</i>

41:20.800 --> 41:21.881
I totally will.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.087
<i>Who was that?</i>

41:29.160 --> 41:32.243
New staffer, maybe.

41:32.320 --> 41:36.450
Don't worry. The negro at the
door is not here to rape you.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.249
<i>So this is what
editors do?</i>

41:38.320 --> 41:39.765
We're taking a break.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.571
<i>What are you
doing here?</i>

41:42.640 --> 41:45.007
You said you want me to drop in and
tell you how the story was going.

41:45.080 --> 41:47.686
Like next week.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.525
It's Saturday night. You don't
have anywhere else to be?

41:50.600 --> 41:52.887
Well, it was either this
or the new Madea movie.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.645
Oh, dear God.
Where does she go this time?

41:55.720 --> 41:56.720
Dialysis?

41:59.360 --> 42:01.408
Man, fuck Tyler Perry.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.800
Yes, can we have a movie with,
you know, characters in them

42:03.840 --> 42:06.081
instead of stereotypes
wrapped in Christian dogma?

42:06.160 --> 42:08.447
Why is every educated person
inherently evil?

42:08.520 --> 42:11.603
Why is this nigga in a motherfucking
dress all the motherfucking time?

42:11.680 --> 42:13.921
How come the only black movies
Hollywood wants to make

42:14.000 --> 42:15.764
are ones with black Mamies
in fat suits?

42:15.840 --> 42:17.729
Or black women
in pain, man?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.484
So basically, we got
black people dying in the past

42:19.560 --> 42:22.882
and black people
dying in the present.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.201
Most people are here
to see <i>Fang</i> 9.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.521
It's got <i>2</i> Chainz in it.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.409
Oh!

43:29.840 --> 43:33.322
Would you stop stereotyping
yourself and put that down?

43:33.400 --> 43:35.084
This ain't Friday, man.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.969
Okay, whatever.
Yo, Sam...

43:37.040 --> 43:40.010
We gotta... we gotta talk
about this protest, girl.

43:40.080 --> 43:44.130
When are we taking the housing
fight to the president?

43:44.200 --> 43:47.727
House folded on sponsoring the rally.
What do we need a sponsor for?

43:47.800 --> 43:50.451
Demonstrations that aren't sponsored
by a house can get shut down.

43:50.520 --> 43:53.126
What about the house
that you're head of?

43:53.200 --> 43:55.680
Hey, Sam,
I read <i>Ebony</i> and Ivy.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.969
What's with the "oofta" and
"nose job" and "100" stuff?

43:59.080 --> 44:02.050
You want me to break
it down for you? <i>Yeah.</i>

44:02.160 --> 44:04.128
You want to know
an ideal Friday in my world?

44:04.200 --> 44:07.249
A fifth of whiskey
and my T-Bone Walker records.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.924
Real talk.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.405
Yo, I'm sorry.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.244
Who the fuck
is T-Bone Walker?

44:12.320 --> 44:15.164
Only the most
influential pioneer

44:15.240 --> 44:18.562
of electric and jump blues, bro.
Know your roots, player.

44:18.640 --> 44:22.281
There are only a few ways colored folk
can survive at a place like this.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.170
White folks always be on stuff,
like, decades too late,

44:25.240 --> 44:27.402
and then y'all want to act
like you discovered some shit.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.370
An "oofta"
is a jazz-age term

44:30.480 --> 44:34.087
for Bojangle types who blacked
it up for white audiences.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.162
Rock, jazz, blues.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.651
Nigga, what you got on
right now?

44:37.720 --> 44:39.848
Some PE.
Public Enemy, my nig...

44:39.920 --> 44:42.287
<i>No! Mm-mm.</i>

44:42.360 --> 44:43.600
Watch that, man.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.045
Hey, you just called him.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.162
Look, y'all get
country clubs.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.641
We get to say "nigger".

44:49.720 --> 44:54.601
An oofta modulates his blackness
up or down depending on the crowd

44:54.680 --> 44:56.011
and what he wants
from them.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.128
<i>What about golf, man?</i>

44:58.200 --> 44:59.565
<i>Or all of our girls?</i>

44:59.640 --> 45:01.290
What do you mean,
all your girls?

45:01.360 --> 45:03.522
Well, there's O.J.
There's Wesley Snipes.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.250
There's Tiger Woods.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.049
Troy over here.
Exactly.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.726
No, there's a word
for that. Okay?

45:09.800 --> 45:12.121
"Reparation."

45:12.200 --> 45:14.771
Forty white bitches
and a mule.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.969
You know, I think Troy would
be great for the talk show,

45:18.040 --> 45:19.530
don't you think, Kurt?

45:22.640 --> 45:23.880
I fold.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.921
<i>Okay, and a nose job
is a wannabe?</i>

45:30.000 --> 45:31.206
Sort of.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.203
Have you seen this?
No.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.248
<i>(Sam) Dear white people
using Instagram.</i>

45:35.320 --> 45:38.324
<i>You have an iPhone
and you go on hikes.</i>

45:38.400 --> 45:41.927
I get it-
[laughing]

45:42.000 --> 45:45.049
Nose jobs smooth their black
edges and try to blend in.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.326
<i>[man]
What's up, Mama?</i>

45:46.400 --> 45:48.528
Mm, don't talk like that.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.165
<i>Don't I know you
from somewhere?</i>

45:50.240 --> 45:51.400
<i>Hey, where do I
know you from?</i>

45:51.440 --> 45:53.568
She was in the video.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.211
Oh, yeah, video girl.
Check it out.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.203
<i>I hate to do it to you,
but I'm going to have to get</i>

45:58.280 --> 46:00.408
<i>real black with you
for a second.</i>

46:00.480 --> 46:03.006
<i>(Sam) A nose job's worst
fear is that their blackness</i>

46:03.080 --> 46:06.004
might cause a fuss
or draw undue attention

46:06.080 --> 46:08.048
so they use it
to self-deprecate.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.810
<i>These white girls
and their tans,</i>

46:09.880 --> 46:11.484
<i>they're starting to get
darker than me,</i>

46:11.560 --> 46:14.245
<i>which isn't that dark.</i>

46:14.320 --> 46:18.086
Hmm, 40,000 views already.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.561
<i>Looks like somebody
submitted you on Buzzfeed.</i>

46:20.640 --> 46:22.449
<i>You're blowing up.</i>

46:22.520 --> 46:25.251
Hey, you want me to get you
a refill or something?

46:25.320 --> 46:28.005
Let me guess.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.889
You're from Ohio.

46:29.960 --> 46:32.088
No, I'm actually
from Vermont.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.083
<i>But the west side.</i>

46:34.160 --> 46:36.322
<i>So what's your beef
with Dear White People?</i>

46:39.280 --> 46:42.045
<i>Dear White People,
how do I feel about it?</i>

46:42.120 --> 46:44.407
<i>It's blacker-than-thou
propaganda</i>

46:44.480 --> 46:48.326
<i>from a bougie Lisa Bonet wannabe
who smells like patchouli.</i>

46:48.400 --> 46:50.846
<i>But frankly, I can't believe we're
letting Sam get away with it.</i>

46:50.920 --> 46:52.365
That's awesome.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.726
<i>Seriously.</i>

46:53.800 --> 46:54.847
That's good.
That's nice.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.081
<i>And 100?</i>

46:56.160 --> 46:57.810
Just keeping it 100.

46:57.880 --> 47:01.646
Just being black as hell,
just 'cause.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.563
<i>What about just
being yourself?</i>

47:03.640 --> 47:05.165
Like I said.

47:05.240 --> 47:08.801
You don't mind, do you?
Of course not.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.360
<i>(Sam) There are only a few
ways colored folks can survive</i>

47:11.440 --> 47:12.726
<i>at a place like this.</i>

47:12.800 --> 47:13.881
All right,
so then what?

47:13.960 --> 47:15.610
So then Sam says...

47:15.680 --> 47:17.603
<i>"ls Daddy scared
that the negroes</i>

47:17.680 --> 47:19.489
<i>are going to start a rebellion
on the plantation?"</i>

47:19.560 --> 47:22.291
<i>To Kurt Fletcher.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>

47:22.400 --> 47:24.129
Okay, we've got
a news item.

47:24.200 --> 47:26.567
But there's something
bigger here.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.961
<i>It's a profile piece</i>

47:29.040 --> 47:31.566
<i>on Armstrong-Parker and Sam
White's pseudo revolution.</i>

47:31.640 --> 47:33.483
What's the headline?

47:33.560 --> 47:35.961
An outdated nationalist
seeks purpose, starts race war?

47:36.080 --> 47:38.048
[all chuckle]

47:38.120 --> 47:39.884
Beer is in the corner.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.809
We'll bang out
the news item tonight

47:41.920 --> 47:43.720
<i>and we'll work on
the profile piece next week.</i>

47:50.240 --> 47:53.562
Yo, man.
[chuckles]

47:53.680 --> 47:55.842
Now you know
I wasn't talking about Soph

47:55.920 --> 47:57.968
with that whole
40 bitches thing, man.

47:58.040 --> 47:59.485
I was just, you know...
Just what?

47:59.560 --> 48:01.642
Just trying to get
on my staff?

48:01.720 --> 48:04.849
I mean, I haven't really
thought... Come on, bullshit.

48:04.920 --> 48:07.366
Look, game night is when we make
our bids for the new staff, okay?

48:07.440 --> 48:08.646
That's why this guy is here,

48:08.720 --> 48:11.087
and why everybody's here.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.202
I just think having good hair

48:13.280 --> 48:16.409
and carrying on
with a degree of sophistication

48:16.480 --> 48:18.164
doesn't make me a traitor
to the race.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.129
Absolutely.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.964
You want to know why they
used to call me Black Mitch?

48:22.080 --> 48:24.048
Absolutely.
Nobody called you that.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.680
Come on, what were you
doing back there?

48:25.720 --> 48:27.529
You're-you're practically
sitting there.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.170
You're about like to bust out
some kind of tap dance.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.208
Come on, man.
I'm a Poli-Sci major, bro.

48:31.280 --> 48:33.169
I just came to hang out.
It doesn't matter.

48:33.240 --> 48:37.131
Either way. Look, either way
my staff, they like you.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.884
A lot.

48:41.800 --> 48:42.961
But you don't.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.526
Look, this thing
with you and Soph...

48:48.600 --> 48:49.647
I'm good to her.

48:49.720 --> 48:50.720
It doesn't matter.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.049
Our dads have been playing
this chess match

48:54.160 --> 48:56.891
off and on since 1972.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.644
What and Sophie
is the white queen?

48:58.720 --> 49:01.041
You're a pawn, Troy.

49:02.680 --> 49:04.603
And maybe it's time
you got off the board.

49:08.280 --> 49:11.011
Here's the deal.
Every year we throw a party.

49:11.080 --> 49:13.606
Right? The whole point
is to mock

49:13.720 --> 49:17.122
the self-important and moronic
entities of the campus.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.329
Now, one way to get staffed

49:20.400 --> 49:22.402
is to write an invite
for the party.

49:22.520 --> 49:25.444
Our invites, they're-
they're freaking legendary.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.000
You know, every year we make the Gawker.
We make the <i>Post.</i>

49:28.080 --> 49:29.241
Tons of blogs.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.328
The important thing is

49:31.400 --> 49:34.290
is if your invite is the one
that is picked to be sent out,

49:34.360 --> 49:38.160
then you're guaranteed
a spot on our staff.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.607
Okay.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.205
So what is
this year's theme?

49:42.280 --> 49:44.408
It's...

49:44.480 --> 49:46.005
I don't know.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.491
Your party is, like,
two weeks away.

49:47.560 --> 49:49.005
Yeah, I know.

49:49.080 --> 49:50.730
Kurt, I want you
to meet someone.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.641
You know Coco?

49:54.760 --> 49:56.489
You guys got
a party coming up?

50:00.600 --> 50:04.491
Got to rally, Sam. Time is now.
Reggie, use your head.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.881
Do you really think that a rally
is going to change things?

50:06.960 --> 50:10.009
It will do a hell of a lot more than
a radio show with views on YouTube.

50:10.080 --> 50:11.809
Oh, okay.

50:11.880 --> 50:15.726
Look... We got power.

50:15.800 --> 50:18.201
Okay? And it's time
we use it.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.441
We earned it.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.249
We?
Oh, that's funny

50:21.320 --> 50:23.322
'cause I didn't see you
running for shit, Reggie.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.245
Sam.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.206
Really?
Tired.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.009
Don't one word me.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.284
Did we go too far?

50:56.360 --> 50:58.727
Did we pass
Armstrong-Parker?

50:58.800 --> 51:02.725
No, I'm Garmin.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.848
Fancy.
[laughs]

51:04.920 --> 51:06.809
Why do you
always got to

51:06.880 --> 51:08.882
snap at me
all the time?

51:09.000 --> 51:11.287
I'm around you 24/7
like a lapdog,

51:11.360 --> 51:14.091
and I don't even really be messing
with no redbone chicks like that.

51:14.200 --> 51:17.040
Don't call me that. Girl, I thought
you was Puerto Rican when I met you.

51:17.080 --> 51:19.526
Oh, okay. Oh, you can dish
it, but you can't take it?

51:19.600 --> 51:21.125
<i>No, I'm taking
my ass home.</i>

51:23.600 --> 51:26.649
George...

51:26.720 --> 51:29.849
I'm not really down
with Sam,

51:29.920 --> 51:31.445
and I'm not in the BSU.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.648
I got kicked out
of Armstrong-Parker

51:33.720 --> 51:35.165
same as Kurt.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.243
But I'm going to write
a good article.

51:40.320 --> 51:41.401
Okay?

51:42.440 --> 51:43.771
Come on, Sam.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.968
You know how I feel
about you.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.321
How am I supposed to know
how you feel about me?

51:48.400 --> 51:49.970
You know what?

51:51.640 --> 51:53.005
<i>Forgive me if I see
something in you,</i>

51:53.080 --> 51:55.128
something inspiring.

51:59.080 --> 52:01.003
Some folks like me
can get behind.

52:48.960 --> 52:51.008
Tell me you'll
set up the rally.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.482
I'll set up the rally.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.163
<i>Absolutely. (Kurt) Right?
I think so.</i>

53:01.280 --> 53:03.203
<i>I think...
I think it's bold.</i>

53:03.280 --> 53:05.408
<i>I think it's ironic.</i>

53:05.480 --> 53:07.164
<i>I think it's
everything we need,</i>

53:07.240 --> 53:09.402
<i>and don't tell me
I'm the only one...</i>

53:09.480 --> 53:11.608

movement needs to be cut down to size.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.245
<i>(Kurt) Right, right?
(Mitch) Yep.</i>

53:13.320 --> 53:15.607

Beautiful. Mitch?</i>

53:15.680 --> 53:17.409
<i>You got
your hip-hop party, man.</i>

53:17.480 --> 53:19.801
Bolly, bolly.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.041
I'm telling you, man.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.485
This is going to be huge.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.847
Fucking epic.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.490
<i>(Kurt)

53:26.560 --> 53:28.403

53:37.160 --> 53:39.686
It was nice seeing you again.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.205
Where's Sophia?

53:43.320 --> 53:46.608
I have no idea.
Hmm.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.603
Can't wait to see what
story you come up with.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.285
Night, Lionel.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.287
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.601
Party is not over.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.087
<i>(Lionel) It's two
o'clock in the morning.</i>

54:09.160 --> 54:11.128
Sorry, bro.

Invitation only.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.526

55:03.000 --> 55:04.650

55:07.760 --> 55:09.489
And what's that
supposed to mean?

55:13.120 --> 55:17.967
Oh, no, really,
it's fine.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.520
I'm not even really
into black dudes anyway.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.964
I mean, my parents really
should have just named me

56:00.760 --> 56:02.489
You know, it is 10 A.M.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.369
Hmm.

Sam would agree.</i>

56:20.760 --> 56:22.967
Poor thing.

56:23.040 --> 56:25.691
She was light-skinned
and everything.

56:28.600 --> 56:31.126
Hell, I said
it wasn't like that.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.803
All right?

56:34.880 --> 56:37.645
<i>My Pops, he wanted me
with Fletcher's daughter.</i>

56:47.320 --> 56:50.130
You will.

56:50.200 --> 56:52.441
You should do it.

<i>So is that
what you want?</i>

57:06.080 --> 57:07.445
To be famous?

57:13.640 --> 57:15.369
I want people...

I like you a lot.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.129
What do you do...

58:25.200 --> 58:28.044
when you go
in the bathroom?

58:28.120 --> 58:30.282
Or is it just to get
away from me?

58:34.080 --> 58:37.368
I smoke weed.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.681
And I write jokes.

59:39.080 --> 59:41.526
What the hell are you doing here?
This is my apartment.

59:41.640 --> 59:44.246

Well, head of house

Hello.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.205
Finally made it in.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.645
You moved
around a lot, right?

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.848
You must
have been terrified

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.161
when you saw Armstrong-Parker
written on your moving assignment.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.571
I was just finishing up.

Do black people scare you?
No.

You're too scared
to even ask anyone for a cut.

My man, how come
you never come to BSU?

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.887
I listened to Mumford & Sons

You really think I'm black
enough for the Union?

Black people
can't be racist.

Prejudiced, yes,
but not racist.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.203
Racism describes a system of
disadvantage based on race.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.123
Black people can't be racist,

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.202
because we don't stand
to benefit from such a system.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.408
Your antics
are making press, Sam.

<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.564
Yo, you ain't
getting cold feet.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.803
No, but...
how long do I have to talk?

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.161
You're kidding me, right?

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.685
It's sort of the keynote.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.486
Look, Reggie, I think that the whole
Malcolm X thing is more your lane.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.484
<i>I'm just</i> not... <i>(Reggie) These
people came here to see you, Sam.</i>

Hi. No, I'm kind of
in the middle...

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.440
<i>(Sam)
Okay...</i>

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.967
Okay.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.001
Okay.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.886
I got to...

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.640
You ready?

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.611
Sam.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.123
Sam!

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.123
<i>(Reggie) Sam, you have
our protest permits!</i>

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.440
Sam.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.444
[knocking]

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.761
Sam. Do you want me
to tell him to go?

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.208
<i>(Sam) You're so tough.</i> I will.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.964
No, I want you to wait
until they've gone,

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.565
and then I want you
to head home.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.130
I'm trying
to be here for you.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.884
Can you be
somewhere else for me?

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.167
Sam, we know you're home.
We just want to talk.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.884
What do you see in him?

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.122
[sighs]

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.762
Okay, okay.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.922
No, I get it. Your parents owned
in Harlem, or something, right?

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.724
<i>You watched Do The Right
Thing in high school,</i>

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.007
and now you just want
to prove that you're down.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.128
I want to be down? How long does it
take to get your hair like that?

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.487
[knocking]
Yo, Sam, open the door.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.291
I will call you
tomorrow, Reggie!

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.850
Damn.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.285
You don't understand.
Girls like me...

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.124
What, have to pick a side?

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.123
I'm sick of your tragic
mulatto bullshit, Sam.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.440
You can't say "mulatto."

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.766
Mulatto, mulatto, mulatto!

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.080
Did somebody say "mulatto"?

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.764
Window. Go out the window.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.842
I'm sorry if I can't be
your Nubian prince

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.809
on my black horse ready to take
you back to fucking Zumunda.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.247
That's not a real
African country.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.920
Can I at least get credit for a
solid Coming to America reference?

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.205
This isn't you, Sam.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.521
No? And who am I?

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.967
You're this... girl.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.849
<i>Perceptive.</i>

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.247
Who likes to argue with me
about every fucking thing.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.005
And I hate it, because we both
know you're smarter than me.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.128
<i>Your favorite director
is Bergman,</i>

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.282

<i>You love bebop, but you've
got a thing for Taylor Swift.</i>

<i>I know, because my Mac

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.323
I was so careful. You like to watch
me when you think I'm sleeping,

<i>[Reggie knocking]

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.041
You're more Banksy than Barack,

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.090
but you've been co-opted as some sort
of revolutionary leader or something?

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.571
But really?

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.290
You're an anarchist,

a beautiful filmmaker.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.409
And beautiful...

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.561
in general.

[cell phone dings]

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.011
Yeah.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.605
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.966
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.125
Okay, get some sleep.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.570
Everything all right?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.763
His condition is stable.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:20.881
Good.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.962
That's good, Sam.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.529

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.370
What?

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.090
Sorry.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.881
Your video
is picking up steam.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.479
I told you I was good TV. Hmm.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.729
Yeah, the show
I'm scouting for

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.325
is called <i>Black Face,
White Place.</i>

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:05.243
It's a reality,
like true life.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.607
Every episode focuses
on a different one of us

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.920
and the ceiling.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.451
Interesting.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.126
Interesting?

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.167
You think they want
interesting, dignified stories

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.527
of triumph
and survival? No.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.046
They want the authentic
urban experience,

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.645
which is basically
network talk

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.524
for bitching
and weeping.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.446
I'm telling you this
because the network wants

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.727
to pick a certain subject
to go to series.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.202
<i>We've got one episode,
one shot at that subject,</i>

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:37.011
<i>so if</i> we <i>do</i> this...
We do it all the way.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.920
Guessing Sam
turned you down?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.569
I think so.
She called me

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.246

that's good,

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.130

Well, I'm about to get
a whole lot more.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.005
Look, we don't have anybody

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.560

a great idea, so we...

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.086
I want to emcee it.

Okay. Okay, well...

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.963
Look, we're here to talk to you
about what we want.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.405
You want me.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.164
And in order to get me,

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.129
you have to let me
emcee your party.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.044
<i>Oh, and I'd also like to do
a live video blog</i>

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.329
They've got to.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.965
They need me.

Right, well, we don't...
we don't really let people

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.602
Well...

you got a week to put
this thing together, Boo-boo.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.491
So what's it going to be?

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.483
You look surprised.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.964
It's just not everyone is
as camera ready as you are.

Sam currently has
445 votes.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.129
That's 200 more than she had last
week during the actual election.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.486
She cheated.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.369
She hacked the system.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.886

to do a thing like that.

the wrong tree. Okay?

<i>I appreciate this.</i>

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.410
Your advisor tells me that you're
hanging on by a thread in your major.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:48.883
<i>Maybe it's time
for you to reprioritize.</i>

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.167
You're trying
to frighten me,

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.369
but I think you're
the one who's scared.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.649
And I think
that you long for days

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.008
when blacks were hanging from
trees and denied actual rights.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.687
<i>That way you would have something
to actually fight against.</i>

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.762
<i>You'll be facing two hearings

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.127
<i>that could end in either
a suspension or probation.</i>

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.124
One on the merit
of your show...

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.211
the other on your election
to head of house.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.886
<i>Your responsibilities
to your house are suspended.</i>

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.088
<i>Your show is dead.</i>

<i>And if there is another one
of your illegal demonstrations</i>

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.401
<i>it's going to get
a lot worse.</i>

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.289
This is a critical time
for this school.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.330
You're damn right it is.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.562
We don't have
an intolerance problem here.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.809
Except for the one
I'm looking at.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.004
You didn't tell me that you and
Sophia had a misunderstanding.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.807
Who did?

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.167
Her father.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.446
She was very upset.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.090
What vision do you have
for yourself, Troy?

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.611
Get my degree

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.886
then law school, then...

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.291
And what has that got to do

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.771
with partying with Kurt,

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.888
smoking weed,
and writing jokes?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.525
So okay, what is it?

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.524
The spotlight
that Kurt gets?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.250
You want to see yourself
on TV?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.800
You know how many black men
waste their lives

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.451
trying to be on TV,
be rappers or ballplayers?

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.490
Dad, no. I want what
we always talk about.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.483
Maybe have
my own firm someday,

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.726
run for office.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.928
Make a difference.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.321
What about the drugs?

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.681
I have been in academia
a long time.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.285
I've seen a lot of things.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.242
And the men
who really run this world,

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.209
oh...

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.001
you've got no idea what
they see when they see you.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.249
You are not going to be
what they all think you are.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.847
You are not going to give them
that satisfaction.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.123
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.326
Yes, sir.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.404
Get out of my sight.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.570

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.971

What Party?</i>

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.049
Yeah, cute.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.407
Let me tell you something.
You picked a hell of a time.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.881
<i>It's the Halloween party. I want
you to listen to something.</i>

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.122
<i>It's canceled, Kurt.
End of story.</i>

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.320
<i>(Kurt) I can't cancel. There's
like 100 people coming.</i>

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.726
Hey.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.046
Lionel's story
on the would be protest

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.168
outside Gillespie
is running tomorrow.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.402
Yeah, and I've also got Lionel
working on a profile piece

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.448
of Armstrong-Parker,
like you suggested.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.409
Really break down
what's going on.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.730
Right?

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.041
It's almost like they...

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.043
recycle so much
from their past.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.600
Music, food, fashion,

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.082
and now turbulence.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.049
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.248
<i>Take care.</i>

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.011
Well? That was our
Times advisor.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.730
He said it's stories
like these

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.882
that get editors
letters of recommendation.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.201
[knocks]

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.681

didn't scare you this time?

<i>(Annie)
Lionel, please.</i>

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.964
You're only
technically black.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.010
G? Going to French.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.607
Should I save you a seat?
(George) Yeah, thanks.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.722
You need something?
I saw your email.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.564
Oh, yeah.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.122
I need someone to do
the donors event on Saturday.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.043
A small dinner
for the school's big givers.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.009
That's Halloween night.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.163
Right, which is why
no one else will take it.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.846
Ah, thus the new guy.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.888
I'm going to class, but...

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.042
you can stay and check out
last year's piece if you want.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.487
You'll do fine.
I don't know.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.166
Is there going to be any racially
fueled outbursts at this thing?

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.526
You never know, right?

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.685
Hey, am I a good writer?

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.929
You'll get better.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.606
And we need you right now.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.684
Please, you're just
one big recommendation

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.966
away from the Times.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.485
Hey...

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.970
There's a big party
after the donors event.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.362
Call me after.
Maybe we can hang?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.522
Yeah, yeah,

Kirk. Wait.

Yo.

my card revoked.

Someone could say
that a show that had

Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn,
and Kunta Kinte himself

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.290
was a pretty black show.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.160
That work out for you?
No, no, it did not.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.687
At least not in high school.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.411
Bet there's, like, a statue
of you in your high school.

that out?

Yeah, it's out there.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.807
Yeah, it's like a black hole
for white people's fingers.

They're... obsessed.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.931
I mean, you know
I cut hair, though.

just ask me?

Third and Basin.

to your high school...

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.801

If you guys will
excuse me for one moment.

Tell me...

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.487
why are white folks
so obsessed with being black?

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.329

to blonde Barbie doll weaves?

of setting it off.</i>

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.011
Son, you're being rude.

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.289
Oh, am I?

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.601
Well, how about I tell
all your precious donors

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.081
and anybody who will listen what kind
of school it is they're giving to!

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.764
What is wrong with you?

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.604
How dare you?

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.409
You can't come over here
and talk to your father...

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.960
All I say is "Yes, sir"
and "No, sir."

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.771
Now look, I should have brought this to you
earlier, but I didn't know what to do.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.287
Okay, let's wait.
Listen to me!

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.521
<i>(Reggie)
Done right, brother.</i>

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.246
What's the plan?

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.243
We go over there.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.890
Now.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.724
Think there's
enough of us?

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.041
Latinos United
is meeting across the hall.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.565
Asian-American League, too.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.008
You guys got better snacks.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.165
Wait, what?

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.811
Yeah, dude,
we all got it.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.928
I mean, everything
is cool, right?

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.810
Take that shit off!

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.167
Take that fucking shit off.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.564
Wait, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.847
Jesus!

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.922
We're putting an end
to this, Kurt.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.480
You know what? Everybody get
the fuck out of my house.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.767
Okay?
I'm calling the cops.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.170
Let's make it do
what it do!

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.800
<i>One, two, one, two, three.</i>

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.326
<i>Yo, give me your wife
before I slap ya.</i>

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.970
I've been looking
for some dames,

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.764
but there's not
another chapter.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.002
<i>You can do me slow,
you can do me fast.</i>

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.606
You can add it to my league.
I'm the royalty to ask for.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.570
One, two, wa-wa-wa-one.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.004

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.091
My name is Lionel.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.685
Some call me Ly.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.728
Most people think
I kind of talk quiet.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.167
<i>But that's all right,
that's all cool.</i>

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:28.084
I'd rather be white
than tap dance with you.

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.969

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.042

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.684
Get the fuck
out of my house.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.569
What you doing?
Get the fuck out of here!

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.326
What?

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.811
Say it.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.927
Come on.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.291
You know, this may come
as a shock to you,

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.842
but these people don't give a fuck
about no Harriet motherfucking Tubman.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.724
They pay millions of dollars

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.689
on their lips, their tans,

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.206
their asses, Jay-Z tickets,

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.282
because they want
to be like us.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.489
And they got to be
for a night.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.324
I'm not about to go out
into the streets

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.210
and protest a fucking
Halloween party.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.885
He can't help it.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.850
But why do you have
to be such a fag?

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.921
Looks like you got me
right where you want me, huh?

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.407

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.729
Hey...

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.003
I didn't do this, Sam.
I didn't do this.

<i>Outrage over an African-
American themed party</i>

<i>(Sam) Naturally, a dozen

<i>We don't condone this

<i>Housing reform!

<i>I mean, the fact that

<i>I mean, in this day and age,

<i>(Sam)
The campus was divided.</i>

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.610
<i>Was the party an act of free
speech, or was it racism?</i>

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.570
<i>I mean, this is only a debate
because of who Kurt's dad is,</i>

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.166
<i>which just proves the point.</i>

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.971

<i>And they got to be

Of course I got
my dad involved.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.969
It was the right thing to do.

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.805
And now all of these posters
just started showing up.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.848
I mean, why settle
for head of house

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.366
<i>when there's a need for me

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.204

You know what?

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.170
Never mind.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.289
<i>(Kurt) When I heard what
the group was planning,</i>

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.402
I emailed my staff
and I told them to quit.

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.562
That is a copy of the
email in front of you.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.641
And who's this?

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.008
My lawyer.

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:15.920
So when I got the invite and
saw everyone clicking yes,

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.485
I figured it was back on.

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.760
We know you
were planning this.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.643
Your son tell you that?

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:22.688
"Wishing you could sip on
henny out your crunk cup

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.728
"without a bitch

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.604
<i>You write this, Troy?</i>

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.808
No.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.167
Mine wasn't chosen.
But you wanted to be.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.527
<i>What I wanted didn't matter then,
so why should it matter now?</i>

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.961
I'm the one who got you
to send the police, remember?

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:39.169
The invite came from the
Pastiche Facebook account.

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.242
<i>(Kurt)
I canceled the party!</i>

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.800
You got to believe me.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.360
What were your intentions when
you went back the second time?

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.169
To stop it.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.850
By any means necessary?

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.930
Someone once told me that

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.287
Winchester was like jazz.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.771
<i>Now I don't know much
about jazz,</i>

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.729
but from what I can tell,

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.849
when your solo is up,

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.962
you better blow.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.611
<i>(Dean) You want to hear
something strange?</i>

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:09.047
<i>The Pastiche group page
hadn't been used for months</i>

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.406
<i>until the invite went out.</i>

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:12.005
Why am I even here?

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.520
What's interesting
is how easy it was

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.608
to access the group page.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.002
<i>The password was "pastiche"
spelled with a dollar sign</i>

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.844
<i>according to Kurt,</i>

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.002
<i>but it seems
it's recently been changed.</i>

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.082
<i>I couldn't
figure it out at first.</i>

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.049
Then I thought
to try something.

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:33.127
<i>578-35-26-196.</i>

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.846
Eleven numbers.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.684
Just like
our student l.D. numbers.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:43.763
Just like
your student l.D. number.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:48.847
As much as you hate him,
you will stop at nothing

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.400
to protect your master
and his boy.

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.847
Did you send out
the invite, Sam?

01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:00.369
<i>(Sam) lt wasn't speeches thet
turned the tide for civil rights.</i>

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.331
<i>It was the anarchists willing to provoke
the police, get sprayed by hoses,</i>

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.886
<i>anything to cause a scene
and make press.</i>

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.804
That invite,
whoever sent it,

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.042
should have been met
with derision and outrage.

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.327
Instead, 100 people,
your students,

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.482
showed up,
and they pulled out posters

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.050
and decorations and costumes

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.650
that they had made
for such an event,

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.085
and they showed our school

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.401
exactly where it's at.

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.723
Well, you've made
some new friends.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.564
<i>(Troy) I guess you
could call them that.</i>

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.602
So...
No, not right now.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.721
Not here.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.806
Fine.
Oh, come on, Coco.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.604
Fuck you, Troy.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.364
Look, my dad saw your videos,

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.891
and he's just
a little worried...

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.088
How it will look?

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.889
With your campaign and all?

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.321
What's your best friend
Reggie think?

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.684
Hey... we had fun.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.569
All right?

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.803
You know, I get that everybody
else wants you to win, Troy.

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.245
But do you?

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.844
Hello, Sam.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.521
I read about
Armstrong-Parker.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.206
Yeah, Pres. made
an executive withdrawal,

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.601
so Armstrong stays black.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.728
Congrats.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.730
I don't know. It's getting a
little too dramatic, man.

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.725
I'm thinking about getting
an apartment off campus.

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.484
So we'll see.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.524
Sam White going against the grain?
Shocking.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.047
How's Papa White?

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.884
Recovering.
Good.

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.241
Well... We were actually
on the phone last night

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.004
for hours.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.602
It was the first time
we talked since the bypass.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.126
And he was putting up
a strong front,

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.328
teasing me about being
so worried.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.722
And then came the stories
about me as a little girl

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.081
that I'd heard 1,000 times.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:21.926
About how...

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.045
independent I was.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.731
Want to talk about it?

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.324
My mom worked nights,

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.890
so he'd always
take me to school, and...

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:42.724
it used to piss me off

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.883
because he'd follow me
all the way to homeroom.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.530
And whenever he'd try
to hold my hand,

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.685
I'd scream and...
pull it away.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:55.128
The students
and the parents

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.965
they'd see this white man

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.850
and this black girl

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:03.002
and they'd wonder
what we were doing together.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.449
Even at nine, I could feel
their eyes on me.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.443
And I was just
a bratty girl.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:13.167
I didn't know any better,
but the thought of losing him...

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.808
You know?

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.531
I, um...

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.968
I just feel so bad.

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:31.243
How awful am I
to do that to...

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.120
him, or to anyone...

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.165
that I...

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.004
love.

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.006
I'm sure he forgives you.

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.445
You think so?

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:03.326
So anyway, I don't know...

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.006
why I said all that.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.570
Sam, where are you going?

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.725
I don't know.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.808
Lunch.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:21.366
Isn't it Mac N' Cheese day
at Armstrong-Parker?

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.524
You think
they'll let you in?

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.644
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.609
<i>First you try to break up
the black house.</i>

01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:58.762
Then you take down the sister
with the little radio show.

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:00.729
Then after all of that,

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.928
your son throws a blackface party.
Now wait a minute.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.367
Now if you thought you were having
trouble finding money before,

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.761
just wait until cable news
gets their hands on this story.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.002
I mean, Bill Maher
is going to fuck you up.

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.081
You know,
I've heard enough.

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.810
I'm sorry.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:16.043
Look, the point is
from where I'm sitting,

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.361
this place is a gold mine.
What?

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.721
We still need the stuff
that leads up to the party.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.131
That happened already.

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.201
Well yeah, we can
re-enact it.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.691
Re-enact.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.842
It's a documentary term.
I...

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.446
The point is, I could be putting
together an overall deal today.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.046
I am talking real money.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.561
Turns out the only thing Americans
love in their reality TV

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:37.371
more than ignorant black kids
is crazy racist white folks.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.851
<i>(Dean)
Now look here.</i>

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.287
This is an honorable
institution.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.330
The idea that we would
so much as entertain...

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.446
How much we talking?

01:44:48.305 --> 01:44:54.868
