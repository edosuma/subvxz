00:07.241 --> 00:08.109
Hey, Murph.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.877
You know what time it is?

00:09.877 --> 00:11.412
It's time to get busy.

00:34.235 --> 00:34.902
I feel like the cat

00:34.902 --> 00:36.470
is watching us.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.639
We don't have a cat.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.307
(cat meows)

00:39.307 --> 00:40.274
Ahh!

00:40.274 --> 00:41.309
Hi there!

00:41.309 --> 00:42.943
No, bad Adam!

00:42.943 --> 00:45.146
(Adam hissing)

00:45.146 --> 00:47.415
Oh, I see you're circumcised.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.449
But you're not Jewish or Muslim,

00:48.449 --> 00:49.117
are you?

00:49.117 --> 00:50.651
No, I'm Catholic.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.319
What?

00:51.319 --> 00:52.420
Then it's pretty weird you're

00:52.420 --> 00:53.454
circumcised, isn't it?

00:53.454 --> 00:54.622
No, it isn't.

00:54.622 --> 00:55.423
It's normal.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.325
Actually, it's not.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.792
Hi, I'm Adam Conover.

00:58.792 --> 00:59.460
And this is

00:59.460 --> 01:00.928
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:00.928 --> 01:01.662
Just get it over with.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.441
America is one of the only

01:13.441 --> 01:14.342
countries in the world that

01:14.342 --> 01:16.009
practices routine non-religious

01:16.009 --> 01:17.511
circumcision, yet most of us

01:17.511 --> 01:18.946
don't even know why we do it.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.114
Haven't you ever wondered why

01:20.114 --> 01:21.349
your turtle has no shell?

01:21.349 --> 01:22.450
No.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.351
Oh, just let him.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.452
It'll only take 21 minutes

01:24.452 --> 01:25.653
plus commercials.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.259
Here you go.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.627
Promotes the show.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.964
To learn more, let's go back in

01:36.964 --> 01:38.299
time to the day

01:38.299 --> 01:39.633
you were circumcised.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.968
God, no.

01:40.968 --> 01:41.635
By the time your tip

01:41.635 --> 01:42.536
got snipped,

01:42.536 --> 01:43.337
circumcision had been

01:43.337 --> 01:45.339
a tradition for generations.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.540
Mr. and Mrs. Murphy,

01:46.540 --> 01:47.208
would you like me to

01:47.208 --> 01:48.976
circumcise Brian?

01:48.976 --> 01:50.344
Um, yeah, I guess.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.212
I mean, his should look like

01:51.212 --> 01:53.314
mine, right?

01:53.314 --> 01:53.981
Ooh!

01:53.981 --> 01:54.648
(baby crying)

01:54.648 --> 01:55.316
But the source of that

01:55.316 --> 01:56.850
tradition is real weird.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.186
His should look like

01:58.186 --> 01:59.487
mine, right?

01:59.487 --> 02:00.221
His should look like

02:00.221 --> 02:01.655
mine, right?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.691
Yep, better cut him.

02:03.691 --> 02:04.492
Reckon it'll stop him

02:04.492 --> 02:05.159
from masturbating.

02:05.159 --> 02:05.993
What?

02:06.026 --> 02:06.694
Yep.

02:06.694 --> 02:07.995
Though religious circumcision

02:07.995 --> 02:08.896
has been practiced in the Middle

02:08.896 --> 02:10.498
East for millennia, no one did

02:10.498 --> 02:11.332
it in the U.S.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.000
until the puritanical 19th

02:13.000 --> 02:14.868
century, when sexphobic doctors

02:14.868 --> 02:16.069
promoted it as a way of

02:16.069 --> 02:17.037
preventing your kids from

02:17.037 --> 02:18.906
committing their favorite sin.

02:18.906 --> 02:19.840
Observe.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.842
The vile masturbator.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.177
The sallow complexion.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.512
The rotten teeth.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.079
The open sores.

02:26.079 --> 02:26.847
Actually, I think

02:26.847 --> 02:27.748
I have syphilis.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.082
Official diagnosis:

02:29.082 --> 02:30.684
masturbation!

02:30.684 --> 02:31.852
One prominent advocate of

02:31.852 --> 02:33.387
dingle-docking was, and I'm not

02:33.387 --> 02:34.522
making this up,

02:34.522 --> 02:36.089
John Harvey Kellogg,

02:36.089 --> 02:38.025
the inventor of Corn Flakes.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.693
My cure is twofold.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.362
A diet rich in flaked corn.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.063
Ooh!

02:43.063 --> 02:44.031
And cutting off part

02:44.031 --> 02:44.932
of the penis.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.234
Ahh!

02:46.234 --> 02:48.035
Victorian prudes like Kellogg

02:48.035 --> 02:49.737
just straight up hated sex

02:49.737 --> 02:50.904
and thought that by pruning your

02:50.904 --> 02:52.273
peter, they could contain your

02:52.273 --> 02:54.775
base and lustful instincts,

02:54.775 --> 02:55.943
and you don't even want to know

02:55.943 --> 02:56.610
what he thought

02:56.610 --> 02:57.778
you should do to women.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.213
Just apply a little carbolic

02:59.213 --> 03:01.048
acid to the clitoris.

03:01.048 --> 03:01.949
Yikes.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.616
Good thing that one didn't

03:02.616 --> 03:03.551
catch on.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.785
That's crazy.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.953
Being circumcised doesn't stop

03:05.953 --> 03:07.388
me from masturbating.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.289
Yeah, I know.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.223
That's why it's so weird that

03:09.223 --> 03:10.424
we still do it.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.559
But isn't it, like, cleaner,

03:11.559 --> 03:12.426
or something?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.126
Nope.

03:13.126 --> 03:13.794
That's just another old

03:13.794 --> 03:15.062
Victorian myth.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.230
These guys had a lot of weird

03:16.230 --> 03:17.898
ideas about circumcision.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.467
Circumcision is cleaner.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.601
Foreskin is for

03:20.601 --> 03:21.935
filthy immigrants.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.070
And it cures convulsions.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.104
And tuberculosis.

03:24.104 --> 03:24.772
Plus, it's a fun

03:24.772 --> 03:27.975
craft project for doctors.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.310
Now, circumcision can help

03:29.310 --> 03:30.944
prevent a few rare infections,

03:30.944 --> 03:32.313
but so does, you know,

03:32.313 --> 03:33.814
washing your dingus.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.915
Why would you have to cut off

03:34.915 --> 03:36.083
part of your body to keep

03:36.083 --> 03:37.084
it clean?

03:37.084 --> 03:37.785
You don't have to cut off your

03:37.785 --> 03:38.586
butt cheeks to keep your

03:38.586 --> 03:39.487
butt clean.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.321
Ahh.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.656
There's a fine idea.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.592
Ahh!

03:44.592 --> 03:45.326
Ugh.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.159
Let's get out of here.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.828
Taxi!

03:47.828 --> 03:48.929
Okay, but the foreskin

03:48.929 --> 03:49.997
is useless, right?

03:49.997 --> 03:50.998
Actually, pal, the foreskin

03:50.998 --> 03:52.099
plays a very important role

03:52.099 --> 03:53.267
in sex.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.602
It's filled with nerve endings.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.769
It protects the glans so it

03:55.769 --> 03:57.438
doesn't become desensitized,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.139
and it's a natural lubricant.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.774
Natural lubricant?

04:00.774 --> 04:01.775
Like a hot dog in

04:01.775 --> 04:02.776
a buttered bun.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.444
Yeah, like this, see?

04:03.444 --> 04:04.345
Ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.446
Give me my hot dog.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.480
Weird metaphor.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.615
Now, circumcision has been

04:07.615 --> 04:08.982
found to reduce the rate of HIV

04:08.982 --> 04:11.819
acquisition in men by up to 60%,

04:11.819 --> 04:14.187
but condoms reduce it by 80%,

04:14.187 --> 04:15.122
and they don't require you to,

04:15.122 --> 04:17.858
you know, cut your dong off.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.494
Oh, hey, it's your place.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.962
Okay, but girls think uncut

04:21.962 --> 04:23.163
dongs look weird.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.031
Interesting theory.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.033
Let's test it.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.968
Excuse me, Miss?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.370
Does this dong look weird.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.371
Yep.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.472
And does this dong

04:31.472 --> 04:32.340
look weird?

04:32.340 --> 04:33.040
Yep.

04:33.040 --> 04:33.707
All right.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.142
And does this dong look weird?

04:35.142 --> 04:36.143
Dude!

04:36.143 --> 04:36.877
Yep.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.045
All dongs look weird.

04:38.045 --> 04:38.812
Oh. Hayley!

04:38.812 --> 04:39.480
Hi!

04:39.480 --> 04:40.147
Hey, guys.

04:40.147 --> 04:40.848
Oh, hold on one second,

04:40.848 --> 04:42.450
I'll be right down!

04:44.552 --> 04:46.554
Hey, Adam.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.655
Ruining something?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.322
Yep, just telling Murph

04:48.322 --> 04:49.390
about circumcision,

04:49.390 --> 04:50.824
the old "circumsizz."

04:50.824 --> 04:52.192
See, back in the Victorian era--

04:52.192 --> 04:53.327
Another time.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.194
I'm running late for this boozy

04:54.194 --> 04:55.529
painting class.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.664
It's dumb.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.665
Something us affluent

04:57.665 --> 04:58.999
millenials do.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.334
With that guy Matt?

05:00.334 --> 05:01.201
Matt?

05:01.201 --> 05:02.403
No, we broke up.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.405
He was kinda dumb.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.172
Just ran out of stuff to

05:05.172 --> 05:06.173
talk about.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.240
Really?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.242
That's too bad.

05:09.242 --> 05:12.045
Did you want to come?

05:12.045 --> 05:14.081
Of course.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.249
But... (sighing)

05:16.249 --> 05:17.385
I have more awesome sex facts

05:17.385 --> 05:18.552
to tell.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.853
(groaning)

05:19.853 --> 05:21.722
Can I take a rain check?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.491
We'll see.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.396
(car door opening, closing)

05:29.597 --> 05:30.898
Hey.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.265
Can we wrap it up?

05:32.265 --> 05:33.233
Sure.

05:33.233 --> 05:33.934
Now, look.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.102
If you like being circumcised,

05:35.102 --> 05:36.069
or you did it for religious

05:36.069 --> 05:37.204
reasons, fine.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.338
There's no harm in it.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.440
But as far as I can tell,

05:39.440 --> 05:40.541
there's also no particularly

05:40.541 --> 05:42.109
compelling reason to do it,

05:42.109 --> 05:42.910
and the only reason you are

05:42.910 --> 05:44.277
circumcised is because a bunch

05:44.277 --> 05:45.779
of 19th century prudes were

05:45.779 --> 05:47.848
trying to ruin your sex life.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.783
Have fun.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.385
You're back early.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.119
Want to pick up where we

05:52.119 --> 05:53.554
left off?

05:53.554 --> 05:54.221
Not really in

05:54.221 --> 05:55.723
the mood anymore.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.625
Understandable.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.959
I'm just gonna go over

05:58.959 --> 06:00.127
the lesson plan for health

06:00.127 --> 06:01.562
class tomorrow.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.563
It's a big one.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.397
We're going over the dangers

06:03.397 --> 06:05.132
of herpes.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.299
Where did I leave that?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.134
Oh, wow.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.268
Everything you know about

06:08.268 --> 06:09.637
herpes is wrong.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.303
We're gonna have to talk

06:10.303 --> 06:11.405
about this.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.272
Nope.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.306
Nope.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.442
Oh, this one's really bad.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.275
Uh-uh.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.146
All right, health class.

06:19.146 --> 06:19.913
What's in the lesson plan

06:19.913 --> 06:20.981
tomorrow, teach?

06:20.981 --> 06:21.649
I'm teaching them

06:21.649 --> 06:22.315
about herpes.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.116
Oh.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.084
About how herpes isn't a big

06:24.084 --> 06:24.785
deal and people don't really

06:24.785 --> 06:25.619
need to worry about it?

06:25.619 --> 06:26.487
What?

06:26.487 --> 06:27.988
No, about how herpes is super

06:27.988 --> 06:29.423
serious and very dangerous.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.924
Uh, herpes isn't dangerous.

06:30.924 --> 06:31.792
Most of the time, it's not

06:31.792 --> 06:32.793
even noticeable.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.963
Oh, no, you don't, buddy.

06:35.963 --> 06:36.764
'Cause I actually know what

06:36.764 --> 06:38.265
I'm talking about this time.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.800
I even made a video about it to

06:39.800 --> 06:40.834
teach my students.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.935
Oh, cool, let's watch it.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.170
Yeah, let's!

06:43.170 --> 06:44.004
I know this is a trap,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.272
but I'm very confident.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.942
Hey, kids.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.277
DJ Murph here.

06:52.112 --> 06:52.780
I'm gonna use this to apply

06:52.780 --> 06:53.614
to film school.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.682
You totally should.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.683
And I'm here to talk to you

06:55.683 --> 06:57.017
about herpes!

06:57.017 --> 06:58.619
(distorted) It is a serious

06:58.619 --> 07:01.689
sexually transmitted disease.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.690
Wow.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.792
Herpes, that sounds scary.

07:04.792 --> 07:05.693
I'm a teen.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.359
Disease.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.528
It is.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.296
Just ask Herpy, the terrifying

07:09.296 --> 07:10.998
genital herpes virus.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.533
Four out of five people

07:12.533 --> 07:13.667
who carry me don't know

07:13.667 --> 07:14.702
they have it.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.704
I cause an eruption of red sores

07:16.704 --> 07:18.305
around your genitals

07:18.305 --> 07:19.973
and I'm incurable.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.141
(laughing)

07:21.141 --> 07:22.342
Great special effects.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.310
George Lucas is a big

07:23.310 --> 07:24.645
influence on my work.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.146
Wow, it sounds like herpes

07:26.146 --> 07:26.980
is terrible.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.348
Me and my bae better not be

07:28.348 --> 07:30.684
having sexual intercourse.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.885
I wouldn't say that.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.621
But I would rap it.

This is getting good.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.012
It's time for you two

07:59.012 --> 08:00.347
to learn what herpes is

08:00.347 --> 08:01.414
really like.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.183
Ready to show 'em, Herpy?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.518
I'm really not so bad,

08:04.518 --> 08:05.553
buddies.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.187
Whee!

08:07.187 --> 08:07.855
Did you just give us

08:07.855 --> 08:09.022
herpes for real?

08:09.022 --> 08:09.723
Yep.

08:09.723 --> 08:10.691
You're welcome.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.092
What the actual hell?

08:12.092 --> 08:12.760
You just gave us

08:12.760 --> 08:14.094
a serious disease.

08:14.094 --> 08:14.895
No, I didn't.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.396
I gave you herpes.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.231
Let's break it down.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.768
♪♪

08:20.768 --> 08:23.403
Uhh!

08:23.403 --> 08:25.405
Okay, starting from the top.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.874
Eruptions of sores?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.208
That's scare mongering.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.376
Let's call them what they are.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.744
Little red bumps.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.912
Sounds gross.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.446
Yeah, except, you're already

08:33.446 --> 08:34.948
covered with little red bumps.

08:34.948 --> 08:35.749
Mosquito bites,

08:35.749 --> 08:37.184
ingrown hairs, pimples.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.385
To be human is to be covered in

08:38.385 --> 08:39.687
little red bumps, yo.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.288
It's true, I do have bacne.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.090
Yo, you got Conover'd!

08:43.090 --> 08:44.725
Secondly, the reason four out of

08:44.725 --> 08:45.926
five carriers don't know they

08:45.926 --> 08:47.460
have it is because they either

08:47.460 --> 08:49.229
have no symptoms or their

08:49.229 --> 08:50.631
symptoms are so mild they never

08:50.631 --> 08:52.566
notice, and nearly everyone

08:52.566 --> 08:53.233
has it.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.467
If you include oral herpes,

08:54.467 --> 08:56.469
worldwide, nearly 90% of the

08:56.469 --> 08:58.471
global population carries some

08:58.471 --> 08:59.573
strain of herpes.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.473
What?

09:00.473 --> 09:01.408
And that means, if you don't

09:01.408 --> 09:02.643
have it, you're the weird one.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.978
You're the weird one.

09:04.978 --> 09:05.946
Oh!

09:05.946 --> 09:07.480
Stop it!

09:07.480 --> 09:08.315
Stop it, I don't

09:08.315 --> 09:09.983
play basketball.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.251
No.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.920
I straight up don't believe you.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.921
You're not a doctor.

09:13.921 --> 09:14.822
Neither are you.

09:14.822 --> 09:15.823
You're a gym teacher.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.625
This is a doctor.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.291
Oh!

09:18.291 --> 09:18.959
Oh, my God.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.627
Guys, this is

09:19.627 --> 09:20.460
Dr. Jennifer Lang,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.596
a board-certified OBGYN.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.263
Hey, guys.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.331
Thank God.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.999
This guy just gave us herpes.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.668
What's gonna happen to us?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.102
Probably not a lot.

09:29.102 --> 09:29.937
Most people don't even

09:29.937 --> 09:31.338
develop symptoms.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.640
Some people might have a mild

09:32.640 --> 09:34.307
rash around the mouth or genital

09:34.307 --> 09:35.609
region, maybe some red

09:35.609 --> 09:37.010
or white bumps.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.011
The truth is, if you're not

09:38.011 --> 09:39.479
immunocompromised during

09:39.479 --> 09:40.147
the late stages

09:40.147 --> 09:41.348
of pregnancy, you really

09:41.348 --> 09:43.016
don't have to worry about it.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.685
Most sexually active adults ae

09:44.685 --> 09:46.153
gonna be exposed to herpes at

09:46.153 --> 09:47.520
some point in their life.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.289
It's really not a big deal.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.958
That's what I tell my patients.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.625
Thanks.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.459
Thanks, Jennifer.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.293
Oh!

09:53.293 --> 09:54.194
Oh, my God.

09:54.194 --> 09:54.862
Ow!

09:54.862 --> 09:56.296
You gotta give us sunglasses.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.130
The fact is,

09:57.130 --> 09:58.531
our culture's fear of herpes

09:58.531 --> 09:59.366
is totally

09:59.366 --> 10:01.001
out of proportion with how mild

10:01.001 --> 10:02.502
the disease actually is.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.637
We're treating what's basically

10:03.637 --> 10:05.205
junk acne like it's some kind of

10:05.205 --> 10:07.374
sexual plague, and that fear

10:07.374 --> 10:08.642
is pretty recent.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.677
Up until a few decades ago,

10:09.677 --> 10:10.644
no one gave a crap

10:10.644 --> 10:11.812
about herpes.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.180
Whee!

10:13.180 --> 10:14.715
Samantha Beth, my darling,

10:14.715 --> 10:16.684
there's something you must know.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.486
I've got red bumps on my junk.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.054
Oh, Charles!

10:21.054 --> 10:22.222
Me too.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.692
Whatever.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.826
But all of that changed

10:25.826 --> 10:27.160
in the early '80s.

10:27.160 --> 10:27.895
In the hangover

10:27.895 --> 10:29.062
from the sexual revolution,

10:29.062 --> 10:30.664
there was a straight-up cultural

10:30.664 --> 10:32.833
freak-out about STDs and even

10:32.833 --> 10:34.501
benign diseases like herpes

10:34.501 --> 10:35.502
got swept up in

10:35.502 --> 10:37.070
the puritanical panic.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.005
Check out this real

10:38.005 --> 10:40.140
Time Magazine cover from 1982.

10:41.909 --> 10:42.743
Whoa!

10:42.743 --> 10:43.744
Even I think that's too intense

10:43.744 --> 10:45.713
and I scare kids for a living.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.681
Yeah, and it worked.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.016
Hey, babe.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.583
I've got red bumps on my wiener.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.185
(woman gasps)

10:52.185 --> 10:53.887
That's not tubular.

10:53.887 --> 10:54.755
I'm gonna die.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.189
Holy crow.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.057
That does seem out

10:57.057 --> 10:57.925
of proportion.

10:57.925 --> 10:58.591
Yeah.

10:58.591 --> 10:59.592
The only serious side effect

10:59.592 --> 11:01.695
of herpes is shame.

11:01.695 --> 11:02.930
One study found that people

11:02.930 --> 11:04.264
consider herpes more shameful

11:04.264 --> 11:07.267
than any STD other than HIV.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.869
That's crazy.

11:08.869 --> 11:09.903
And herpes is considered

11:09.903 --> 11:11.204
so stigmatized,

11:11.204 --> 11:12.439
there are multiple online dating

11:12.439 --> 11:13.606
sites just for people

11:13.606 --> 11:14.541
with herpes.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.876
All of this over a disease

11:15.876 --> 11:18.211
that 90% of people have.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.212
You know what else is a herpes

11:19.212 --> 11:20.047
dating site?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.448
OKCupid, Match.com,

11:21.448 --> 11:22.382
Christian Mingle.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.450
All of them because nine out

11:23.450 --> 11:25.118
of ten people have herpes.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.720
The only difference between

11:26.720 --> 11:27.587
this guy...

11:27.587 --> 11:29.056
I'm diseased!

11:29.056 --> 11:30.557
I'll be alone forever.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.624
...and this guy...

11:31.624 --> 11:32.625
How you doing, folks?

11:32.625 --> 11:33.626
Anyone for a fulfilling

11:33.626 --> 11:35.295
sexual relationship?

11:35.295 --> 11:36.897
Is that the first guy knows

11:36.897 --> 11:37.965
he has herpes.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.232
Oh, poor sap.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.434
Wait, what?

11:41.434 --> 11:42.903
The fact that we shame each

11:42.903 --> 11:44.972
other this hard over a disease

11:44.972 --> 11:47.307
that practically everyone has

11:47.307 --> 11:48.942
is truly awful.

11:48.942 --> 11:49.943
Okay.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.812
I mean, I probably shouldn't be

11:51.812 --> 11:52.813
that scary about herpes

11:52.813 --> 11:54.247
in class.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.582
It's really not that dangerous.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.984
Looks like he's getting it,

11:56.984 --> 11:57.951
huh, Herpy?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.086
Yay!

11:59.086 --> 12:00.821
Good job, new friends.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.122
Hey, Herpy.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.656
How about taking back the herpes

12:03.656 --> 12:04.657
you gave us?

12:04.657 --> 12:05.993
No can do!

12:05.993 --> 12:08.095
You both already had herpes!

12:08.095 --> 12:08.762
What?

12:08.762 --> 12:09.763
Since when?

12:09.763 --> 12:12.432
Since college!

12:12.432 --> 12:17.004
Oh, Herpy!

12:17.004 --> 12:18.338
You know, the crazy thing is

12:18.338 --> 12:19.272
I don't remember filming

12:19.272 --> 12:20.273
any of that.

12:20.273 --> 12:20.974
Well, now that I've popped

12:20.974 --> 12:21.842
your knowledge cherry,

12:21.842 --> 12:23.310
I'll be on my way.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.747
He's a funny virus.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.449
(laughter)

12:29.449 --> 12:30.851
Hang on.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.518
Did you just say

12:31.518 --> 12:33.353
"popped our knowledge cherry"?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.122
Oh yeah, it's metaphor.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.690
For puncturing a virgin's hymen.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.792
Gross, sorry.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.127
Yeah, it's not just gross.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.694
It's totally wrong.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.363
That's not how a hymen works.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.031
Really?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.299
I didn't know that.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.634
Whoa.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.169
I didn't know something.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.538
Oh, my God!

12:51.538 --> 12:53.040
If you didn't know something,

12:53.040 --> 12:55.675
that means I get to teach

12:55.675 --> 12:56.977
you something.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.379
Oh, my God, yes.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.713
Up next, this is

13:00.713 --> 13:02.883
"Emily Ruins Everything."

13:02.883 --> 13:03.817
We're never gonna have sex,

13:03.817 --> 13:04.651
are we?

13:04.651 --> 13:05.819
Sorry, babe.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.724
My turn to explain something.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.326
Give me your magic TV powers.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.061
Where are they?

13:14.061 --> 13:14.995
Is it your glasses?

13:14.995 --> 13:15.662
No.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.329
It's your glasses.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.898
(Adam groaning)

13:17.898 --> 13:18.565
Whoa!

13:18.565 --> 13:20.333
Your prescription's insane.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.668
Whoever has the knowledge

13:21.668 --> 13:23.236
wields the power.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.004
Oh.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.305
Really?

13:27.875 --> 13:28.876
(snapping)

13:30.911 --> 13:32.512
(snapping)

13:32.512 --> 13:33.380
Stop, you're only supposed to

13:33.380 --> 13:34.915
use the powers for learning.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.416
Oh, I'm getting there.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.750
(clearing throat)

13:37.750 --> 13:40.220
Now, what do you two derpies

13:40.220 --> 13:42.255
think a hymen is?

13:42.255 --> 13:42.923
Do we have to talk

13:42.923 --> 13:43.590
about hymens?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.257
Seems like more of

13:44.257 --> 13:45.025
a lady thing.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.059
Yeah.

13:49.029 --> 13:49.863
Ooh.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.198
This is fun.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.199
Grow up, guys.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.266
You just spent ten minutes

13:53.266 --> 13:54.434
talking about your ding-dongs.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.903
I mean, why is it ickier if it's

13:55.903 --> 13:57.237
about a woman's body?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.105
Fair enough.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.107
So, what's a hymen?

14:00.107 --> 14:03.376
Okay, it's a bit of girl that

14:03.376 --> 14:06.279
covers the vaginal area until

14:06.279 --> 14:07.380
she has sex.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.116
Yes, a freshness seal.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.218
Do not consume if open.

14:11.218 --> 14:11.885
Sorry.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.552
Yeah.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.253
That's what a lot of

14:13.253 --> 14:14.254
people think.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.789
People picture the hymen like

14:16.789 --> 14:18.391
it's one of those paper banners

14:18.391 --> 14:19.626
at a sports game.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.793
They think it covers up a lady's

14:20.793 --> 14:22.062
vagina and then when she has

14:22.062 --> 14:23.063
sex for the first time,

14:23.063 --> 14:24.898
it gets busted.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.436
Seems pretty accurate.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.103
Yep, let's go play

14:30.103 --> 14:30.971
video games. (laughs)

14:30.971 --> 14:32.239
No, you don't.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.974
Everything about that is wrong.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.075
Okay, think about it.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.076
If our hymens completely sealed

14:36.076 --> 14:37.310
our vaginas, where would our

14:37.310 --> 14:38.311
periods go?

14:38.311 --> 14:38.979
I mean, we'd blow up like

14:38.979 --> 14:39.646
the blueberry girl in

14:39.646 --> 14:40.313
"Charlie and the

14:40.313 --> 14:41.081
Chocolate Factory."

14:41.081 --> 14:41.748
Oh, yeah.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.984
And where would you pee?

14:43.984 --> 14:44.751
You know we don't pee out of

14:44.751 --> 14:46.653
our vaginas, right?

14:46.653 --> 14:48.588
We pee out of our urethras,

14:48.588 --> 14:49.589
which is a separate hole.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.158
You're a health teacher.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.325
And our school district

14:52.325 --> 14:54.327
is very underfunded.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.129
So that's how many holes total?

14:57.464 --> 14:59.299
The hymen is actually a thin,

14:59.299 --> 15:01.768
stretchy bit around the vagina.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.003
In most women, our hymens have

15:03.003 --> 15:04.171
an opening that's big enough for

15:04.171 --> 15:06.173
tampons, fingers, and yes,

15:06.173 --> 15:08.441
getting bizzay.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.110
But it's not like a barrier.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.512
It's more like a...

15:12.512 --> 15:16.783
balloon arch.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.517
Okay, but doesn't the hymen

15:17.517 --> 15:18.351
break the first time you

15:18.351 --> 15:19.186
have sex?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.620
Like, doesn't it hurt?

15:20.620 --> 15:21.955
It doesn't have to.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.490
It might, if you're not careful

15:23.490 --> 15:24.291
with it.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.625
Oh, gee...

15:25.625 --> 15:26.793
Oh, fudge.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.861
I damaged the balloon arch.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.830
Oh, fff-- God...

15:30.830 --> 15:32.532
But it can also tear from

15:32.532 --> 15:33.366
doing the splits...

15:33.366 --> 15:34.701
(balloons popping)

15:34.701 --> 15:36.636
...or just living our lives.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.471
Even then, hymens can heal,

15:38.471 --> 15:39.672
and a lot of them never even get

15:39.672 --> 15:41.141
torn in the first place.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.976
One study found that 52% of

15:42.976 --> 15:44.377
sexually active teenage women

15:44.377 --> 15:45.812
had intact hymens.

15:45.812 --> 15:46.546
Really?

15:46.546 --> 15:47.547
Yeah.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.182
(cheering) H-Y-M-E-N!

15:49.182 --> 15:50.817
Not well understood by men!

15:50.817 --> 15:52.885
Go, hymen!

15:52.885 --> 15:53.886
The hymen as you understand

15:53.886 --> 15:56.023
it is a straight up myth.

15:56.023 --> 15:56.856
Okay, Emily.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.325
Are you sure about that?

15:58.325 --> 15:59.559
Maybe you should call in

15:59.559 --> 16:00.727
an expert.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.162
Yeah, that's a good call.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.796
It's what I usually do, so.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.869
How's this for an expert?

16:09.869 --> 16:11.504
Good point, I feel bad.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.505
Our bodies don't come with

16:12.505 --> 16:13.906
built-in virginity detectors

16:13.906 --> 16:14.574
and sex

16:14.574 --> 16:16.076
isn't supposed to hurt

16:16.076 --> 16:17.577
the first time, but this

16:17.577 --> 16:19.846
horrible idea is everywhere

16:19.846 --> 16:21.048
in our culture.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.583
From ska bands.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.917
♪ Zoot suit riot

16:24.917 --> 16:26.719
Ugh, bad name.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.588
To popular TV shows.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.422
So there's a good chance that

16:29.422 --> 16:30.390
Megan was never raped.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.058
These are Megan's

16:31.058 --> 16:32.859
medical records.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.194
An intact hymen.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.328
She's a virgin.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.730
Even the New York Times

16:37.730 --> 16:40.533
gets it wrong.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.734
The Times knows more about

16:41.734 --> 16:43.270
regional politics in Finland

16:43.270 --> 16:44.904
than the female body.

16:44.904 --> 16:45.905
Honestly, the worst part

16:45.905 --> 16:47.107
is the word "daddy."

16:47.107 --> 16:48.741
Yeah, that is inappropriate.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.909
It gets way worse

16:49.909 --> 16:51.244
than band names.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.279
In some parts of the world,

16:52.279 --> 16:53.946
women are forced to show

16:53.946 --> 16:55.415
government officials that their

16:55.415 --> 16:56.783
hymen is intact.

16:56.783 --> 16:57.917
If they don't, they can be

16:57.917 --> 16:59.619
denied jobs, barred from making

16:59.619 --> 17:01.254
rape accusations, even thrown

17:01.254 --> 17:03.723
in jail.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.957
Sorry, Adam.

17:04.957 --> 17:05.758
I know that this is usually

17:05.758 --> 17:06.793
the point where you do some cute

17:06.793 --> 17:07.794
visual gag, I just--

17:07.794 --> 17:08.928
No, skip it.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.130
That's awful.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.564
Really, really awful.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.765
Yeah.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.434
Virginity exams are straight up

17:14.434 --> 17:16.603
sexual assault, and they don't

17:16.603 --> 17:18.271
even prove anything because...

17:22.975 --> 17:24.411
Physically speaking, virginity

17:24.411 --> 17:25.645
doesn't exist.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.413
It's just something we made up

17:26.413 --> 17:27.614
to be mean to women,

17:27.614 --> 17:28.615
like "Entourage."

17:29.649 --> 17:31.318
Wow, I learned something.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.319
That felt great.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.153
I feel taller.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.254
Do I look taller?

17:34.254 --> 17:35.122
Glad to help.

17:35.122 --> 17:35.822
Anyways, it's time

17:35.822 --> 17:36.589

17:36.589 --> 17:37.757
Emily, you know, usually I do

17:37.757 --> 17:38.591
more of a wrap up than that.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.259
Nope.

17:39.259 --> 17:39.926
Hit the road.

17:39.926 --> 17:40.593
It's date night

17:40.593 --> 17:41.428

You?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.101

Fine.

Nope, it's the one problem that

18:32.679 --> 18:34.381
causes all the others.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.148
Shame.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.816
Oh.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.151
I'm not ashamed about sex.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.552
I'm very progressive.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.820
I bought us a sex toy.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.323
You did?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.056
Yeah, you never saw it.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.992
I hid it in the attic.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.360
Maybe I am ashamed of sex.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.027
Yeah.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.196
We all are, at least a little

18:49.196 --> 18:50.863
bit, and that can cause us to

18:50.863 --> 18:52.699
treat each other horribly,

18:52.699 --> 18:53.500
like when we

18:53.500 --> 18:54.334
humiliate people for

18:54.334 --> 18:56.169
having an innocuous disease.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.539
Whee!

18:59.539 --> 19:01.508
Or redesign babies' genitals

19:01.508 --> 19:02.675
for no reason.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.744
(baby crying)

19:04.744 --> 19:06.045
Or teach teenage girls that

19:06.045 --> 19:07.380
their first sexual experience

19:07.380 --> 19:09.148
is gonna be a nightmare.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.188
I did it again.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.389
All of these mistakes

19:16.389 --> 19:18.057
were caused by shame.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.226
Take the example of Kellogg.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.760
He promoted circumcision because

19:20.760 --> 19:22.395
masturbation freaked him out,

19:22.395 --> 19:23.530
but that's crazy because

19:23.530 --> 19:25.398
we all masturbate.

than enough for me, baby.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.901
No, you guys definitely do.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.069
And it's fine with each other

19:30.069 --> 19:31.037
that you do, right?

19:31.037 --> 19:31.704
Oh, of course, go to town.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.372
Oh, yeah,

19:32.372 --> 19:33.039
it's okay if you do.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.574
So why be ashamed of it?

19:34.607 --> 19:35.875
Masturbation is the safest

19:35.875 --> 19:36.943
form of sex.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.110
It releases tons of healthy

19:38.110 --> 19:39.779
endorphins, and it can actually

19:39.779 --> 19:40.613
be used to treat

19:40.613 --> 19:42.249
sexual dysfunction.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.516
That's actually all true.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.084
Masturbation is good for you.

19:45.084 --> 19:45.752
That's what you should tell

19:45.752 --> 19:46.753
your students.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.054
I should.

19:48.054 --> 19:48.755
I will not,

19:48.755 --> 19:49.922
because I'd get fired.

19:49.922 --> 19:50.723
Well, that's sad, because

19:50.723 --> 19:51.891
it's true.

19:51.891 --> 19:52.925
We need to stop doing this

19:52.925 --> 19:54.126
to ourselves.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.228
No one needs to worry if they

19:55.228 --> 19:56.796
like to flick the bean, or if

19:56.796 --> 19:58.064
they're a virgin, or if they

19:58.064 --> 19:59.432
find learning obscure facts

19:59.432 --> 20:00.767
deeply erotic.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.470
Shame is ruining our sex lives.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.071
We shouldn't let it any longer.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.275
Oh, jeez, my speech worked

20:08.275 --> 20:09.242
too well.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.943
I'll let myself out.

How many of you have ever

20:47.814 --> 20:49.782
heard of vitamin megadoses?

20:49.782 --> 20:50.950
I have, but I've also heard

20:50.950 --> 20:52.151
of fairies, and those won't cure

20:52.151 --> 20:52.819
your cold, either.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.486
Great.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.153
Can I go back to doing

20:54.153 --> 20:54.854
my show now?

20:54.854 --> 20:55.822
What's bad for you about

20:55.822 --> 20:56.956
orange juice is the sugar.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.459
Sugar!

20:59.459 --> 21:00.627
Medical shows like this one

21:00.627 --> 21:01.794
end up telling you big fat

21:01.794 --> 21:03.029
lies like that.

21:03.029 --> 21:03.996
You lied to us,

21:03.996 --> 21:05.498
Dr. Todd!

21:05.498 --> 21:06.499
Everyone, stop!

21:06.499 --> 21:07.166
There's an answer to all

21:07.166 --> 21:08.134
of this!
