possesses one quality that you admire.

Rather than choose among them,

00:42.406 --> 00:45.740

10:55.598 --> 10:57.804
You're surrounded
by 50,000 acres of it.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.591
Ha-ha! How quaintly rustic.

11:00.769 --> 11:04.932
Yes, Frederick,
just pick a tree and make it your own.

11:06.358 --> 11:10.225
So, Dad,
l thought we might do an activity later.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.312
- What kind of activity?
- Oh, l don't know.

11:12.488 --> 11:16.236
Maybe press some leaves
or whittle a birdcall

11:16.409 --> 11:19.991
and see if we can lure some finches
to our sill.

11:20.162 --> 11:23.116
Take it easy now, we wanna save
something for tomorrow.

11:24.082 --> 11:26.075
Dad, could you please
be a little more supportive?

11:26.251 --> 11:28.742
l'd like to, but l tried to get you
to camp a million times

11:28.920 --> 11:30.580
and you had to wait
till playoffs are on.

11:30.755 --> 11:33.507
Dad, you can watch
the playoffs all year.

11:34.717 --> 11:36.710
The kids at the next campsite
built a rope swing.

11:36.886 --> 11:38.428
- Can l go over?
- Don't see why not.

11:38.596 --> 11:40.469
Thanks.

11:41.598 --> 11:43.721
- What the hell was that?
- lt's just a rope swing.

11:43.892 --> 11:45.801
Wait till he sees us
drying leaves in the sun.

11:45.977 --> 11:47.602
He'll come running.

11:48.438 --> 11:50.181
l'm just about fed up
with your sarcasm.

11:50.357 --> 11:53.191
l'm trying to do some father-son
bonding here. Will you just butt out?

11:53.359 --> 11:57.523
You know what? l just thought
of something to write in this thing.

12:03.077 --> 12:06.777
ROZ:
This is a bad idea. My hair's flat.

12:06.955 --> 12:09.113
Never have a good date
when my hair is flat.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.999
lf it's flat after, that's a good date.

12:11.167 --> 12:13.160
[DOORBELL RlNGS]

12:13.670 --> 12:17.619
Your hair's not flat, Roz.
lt's delightfully frizzy.

12:19.342 --> 12:20.456
DAPHNE: Hello.
JACK: Hi.

12:20.635 --> 12:22.544
NlLES: Hey, Jack, come in.
You remember Daphne.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.262
- Yes.
- This is Roz.

12:25.180 --> 12:28.098
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi.

12:28.267 --> 12:30.259
So, uh, where are you two going
for dinner?

12:30.435 --> 12:33.222
l thought we'd try the Pergola.
They have a garden patio.

12:33.396 --> 12:36.148
Unless you'd rather eat inside.
l don't want you to get cold.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.308
Oh, don't you worry about that.

12:39.819 --> 12:41.527
Come on, Roz,
l have a couple of wraps.

12:41.696 --> 12:43.771
You can borrow one.

12:43.948 --> 12:46.154
- What do you think?
- She's pretty.

12:46.325 --> 12:48.364
You know, l should check my service
before we go.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.073
- Okay. Can l pour you some wine?
- Sure.

12:52.289 --> 12:53.913
lt's Dr. Betcher.

12:54.332 --> 12:56.124
Really?
Well, isn't Dr. Unger on call?

12:56.292 --> 12:57.490
l'm kind of busy right now.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.587
All right, l'm on my way.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.539
There's an emergency
with one of my post-op patients.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.503
- Please tell Roz l'm really sorry.
- Of course.

13:06.677 --> 13:09.215
- Thanks, Niles.
- Yeah, good luck.

13:10.514 --> 13:14.677
We need a man's opinion.
The velvet trim or the multicoloured?

13:14.851 --> 13:17.009
- Where's Jack?
- He left.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.811
- He left?
- lt was an emergency.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.225
What kind of an emergency?

13:20.398 --> 13:22.936
Like he saw me
and thought l was a dog emergency?

13:24.527 --> 13:27.730
- No, no, no. He said you were pretty.
- That's it?

13:27.905 --> 13:31.356
Well, he flew out of here
as soon as you left the room.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.905
Oh, God, he was just trying
to get out of this date.

13:34.077 --> 13:37.493
- l've been dumped.
- Oh, l'm sure you weren't dumped.

13:37.664 --> 13:41.198
- He was paged, right, Niles?
- Oh, yeah, the old fake page routine.

13:41.376 --> 13:44.412
No, no, no, not even.
He actually called in.

13:47.131 --> 13:49.622
- l should go.
- We understand, you wanna be alone.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.421
No, Roz, l won't hear of it.
You'll stay right here with us.

13:52.594 --> 13:55.264
Oh, l don't wanna be a pain.
You guys have a big evening planned.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.968
Roz, you are so considerate.

13:58.183 --> 14:01.634
We can have an evening any old time.
You'll stay for dinner.

14:01.811 --> 14:04.598
ROZ: All right.
- Allow me.

14:04.772 --> 14:07.228
Well, what are we having?
Because l don't like fish.

14:13.781 --> 14:15.607
Oh, Freddie, there you are.
Thank goodness.

14:15.783 --> 14:18.273
Can l have dinner with these guys?
They're having sloppy joes.

14:18.452 --> 14:21.655
l'm sorry, but Frederick is having
dinner with his family this evening.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.454
Come on, Dad.

14:23.623 --> 14:25.912
That's okay. Come by later.
We're making S'mores.

14:26.084 --> 14:30.247
Yes, we'll see.
All right, now off you go, young people.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.584
Just sit down, Frederick,
and eat your meal.

14:34.758 --> 14:37.676
- Have a good time?
- l guess.

14:38.554 --> 14:39.668
What'd you do?

14:40.263 --> 14:41.592
We played some Frisbee.

14:41.765 --> 14:44.719
Sucked with all those trees
in the way.

14:46.186 --> 14:51.013
Yes, well, perhaps one day
civilisation will cut down all those trees

14:51.190 --> 14:53.681
and pave over this grand wilderness.
Then you and your friends

14:53.859 --> 14:56.860
can play Frisbee without constraint.
How would that be?

14:58.155 --> 14:59.234
l don't know.

14:59.406 --> 15:00.485
l'm done. Can l go now?

15:00.657 --> 15:02.235
- No.
- Why not?

15:02.409 --> 15:05.363
This is your first camping trip
and we're gonna enjoy it together.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.743
This isn't my first camping trip.

15:08.373 --> 15:11.457
- You never told me that.
- l don't tell you a lot of things.

15:11.626 --> 15:14.626
Oh. l see.

15:15.087 --> 15:17.839
Well, you may go.

15:22.386 --> 15:23.761
So...

15:24.096 --> 15:26.669
...he's been camping before.

15:27.307 --> 15:28.931
lnstead of this
being something special,

15:29.100 --> 15:30.974
it's just another thing
l've missed out on.

15:31.144 --> 15:33.717
This trip was a bust
from the get-go.

15:33.896 --> 15:36.221
We leave at daybreak.

15:37.775 --> 15:40.266
What's with you and daybreak?

15:42.071 --> 15:44.857
l'm gonna see if those kids have
a generous grandpa with a six-pack.

15:45.073 --> 15:46.567
Sit.

DAPHNE: l once dated a guy
who was so grabby,

16:00.504 --> 16:03.707
l jumped out of his car
while it was still moving.

16:03.882 --> 16:06.171
Did l ever tell you
about this jerk named Nick?

16:06.343 --> 16:07.718
l dated a Nick.

16:07.886 --> 16:09.001
[DOORBELL RlNGS]

16:09.179 --> 16:11.930
My Nick had a silent G
at the beginning of his name.

16:12.098 --> 16:13.343
He was Vietnamese.

16:16.060 --> 16:18.183
l wonder who this could be.

16:19.689 --> 16:22.226
Oh, what an incredible surprise.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.562
lt's Hans. Hans, come in.

16:23.734 --> 16:27.150
Roz, Daphne, this is Hans.
He's a doctor from my building.

16:27.321 --> 16:28.779
Nice to meet you.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.105
Hello, Hans. What brings you by?

16:31.283 --> 16:33.192
l'm a friend of Frasier.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.537
Uh, l was downstairs, so l thought
l'd pop by, see if he was in.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.864
- Yeah, well, he's not.
- You could stay for a drink.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.710
Why don't come here?
Sit next to Roz.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.118
Niles, help me fix those drinks,
will you?

16:45.296 --> 16:47.039
Yes, dear.

16:48.757 --> 16:52.256
Doctor my eye.
That's Ted, the moron from the deli.

16:54.387 --> 16:57.092
- Are you sure?
- Oh, stop it.

16:57.265 --> 17:00.431
You invited him over here for Roz.
She's in no mood to be trifled with.

17:00.601 --> 17:02.594
- Neither am l.
- l'm sorry. l was trying to help.

17:02.770 --> 17:05.012
Yeah, well, if you want to help,
get rid of him.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.980
Love you.

17:11.528 --> 17:13.153
Can you believe this, Daphne?

17:13.320 --> 17:16.192
Roz, l am so sorry.
This evening's been a disaster.

17:16.366 --> 17:17.907
No, l mean, things are looking up.

17:18.076 --> 17:20.911
Hans and l are really hitting it off.
Do you have any mints in here?

17:21.079 --> 17:23.404
- Try the cupboards.
- Thanks.

17:23.580 --> 17:26.498
l have a really good feeling
about Hans.

17:26.666 --> 17:27.746
He's very funny.

17:27.917 --> 17:31.916
He just told me
he was chief doctor of Brainiactrics.

17:34.341 --> 17:37.045
- Where did he go?
- l gave him the boot. He's gone.

17:37.219 --> 17:40.303
- Who's gone?
- Hans. He had an emergency.

17:40.472 --> 17:43.259
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, Roz--

17:43.433 --> 17:45.425
l thought this one liked me.

17:45.601 --> 17:48.009
Man, l've driven away two doctors
in one night.

17:48.187 --> 17:51.852
No, Hans is just the meat slicer
from the deli.

17:52.983 --> 17:55.770
And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

17:57.571 --> 18:00.821
Oh, God, l just wanna put
this whole night behind me.

18:00.991 --> 18:02.235
l don't blame you one bit.

18:02.408 --> 18:04.366
l'm sure it will all look better
in the morning.

18:04.535 --> 18:05.615
l sure hope so.

18:05.787 --> 18:09.155
You two have listened to enough
of my problems for one night.

18:12.835 --> 18:15.789
<i>Oh, look, Titanic just started.</i>

18:22.594 --> 18:27.552
When you hear that scratching
at your window late at night,

18:27.724 --> 18:33.844
remember that young couple
and Fork Hand.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.187
Oh, come on, that's scary stuff.

18:42.362 --> 18:45.980
l told that to Duke last summer
and he wet his sleeping bag.

18:47.242 --> 18:50.990
Wait a minute.
lsn't this Duke's sleeping bag?

18:51.913 --> 18:54.201
- Now you're scared.
- Ha-ha.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.998
Oh, gosh, Dad.

18:59.169 --> 19:01.874
l'm sorry l snapped at you earlier.

19:02.089 --> 19:06.216
You know, l guess l was just hoping
this trip might give me and Frederick

19:06.384 --> 19:11.805
some sort of,
l don't know, golden moment.

19:13.182 --> 19:16.302
- l guess l'm just disappointed.
- l know.

19:17.102 --> 19:21.147
But you know, none of this
would be happening if we had a TV.

19:21.690 --> 19:25.023
TV makes everyone get along.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.978
MARTlN: Oh, hey, buddy.
FRASlER: Hi, Fred.

19:29.155 --> 19:32.904
- Well, l'll just take a little walk.
FRASlER: All right.

19:33.076 --> 19:35.068
- See you in a bit, Dad.
MARTlN: All right.

19:35.912 --> 19:39.197
Frederick, we're gonna be leaving
in the morning.

19:39.373 --> 19:40.997
But l don't wanna go.

19:41.166 --> 19:44.037
No? l thought you'd be
dying to get back to your Game Boy.

19:44.211 --> 19:47.544
Well, yeah, but l kind of made plans.

19:47.714 --> 19:49.707
Oh, really? With who?

19:50.175 --> 19:52.463
- Nobody.
- Oh, then, you don't have plans.

19:52.635 --> 19:56.585
We leave at-- Nine-ish.

19:58.391 --> 20:01.060
Okay, fine.
l have plans with Melody.

20:02.186 --> 20:04.855
- The S'mores girl?
- Yeah.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.891
She's cute.

20:07.065 --> 20:08.559
She's a cheerleader.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.483
Ho-ho!

20:11.403 --> 20:15.482
l remember a particular cheerleader
from my youth.

20:15.657 --> 20:19.571
Lorna. She was a beautiful girl.

20:19.744 --> 20:21.238
ln fact, l was so intimidated by her,

20:21.412 --> 20:23.903
l could never even work up
the courage to approach her.

20:24.081 --> 20:25.658
- Dad.
- Damn it.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.078
l kissed her.

20:29.044 --> 20:30.455
Oh.

20:30.629 --> 20:34.294
l know. lt was her first time.

20:37.260 --> 20:39.133
lt was my first time too.

20:40.054 --> 20:41.548
l see.

20:41.722 --> 20:45.423
Don't tell Mom about this, okay?
She'd ask all kinds of stupid questions.

20:45.601 --> 20:49.550
Don't worry, son.
lt's just between you and me.

20:50.772 --> 20:53.310
You know,
l think l'll write for a while before bed.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.530
Whoa. Did you see the stuff
that Grandpa wrote about you?

21:02.700 --> 21:04.277
Give me that.
