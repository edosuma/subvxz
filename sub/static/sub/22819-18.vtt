00:07.550 --> 00:11.888
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.055 --> 00:16.934
<i>If I had a heart,
I could love you</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:22.732
<i>If I had a voice, I would sing</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:29.030
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:34.827
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.250 --> 00:45.254
<i>If I had a voice, I would sing</i>

00:55.806 --> 00:57.224
No!

00:58.726 --> 01:01.854
And then he took
one of the children,

01:01.937 --> 01:05.608
a little boy,
and then he ate him!

01:05.733 --> 01:06.859
Like this!

01:13.741 --> 01:14.825
Halt!

01:20.665 --> 01:22.166
Who are you, stranger?

01:23.376 --> 01:25.169
My name is Hvitserk,

01:25.252 --> 01:26.712
son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.009
I've come to see King Olaf.
We are meant to be allies.

01:35.388 --> 01:37.098
Friend, I have just ridden

01:37.181 --> 01:40.101
across mountain ranges
and frozen lakes.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.186
I am dying of cold.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.605
Will you not at least let me
warm myself by your fire?

01:45.898 --> 01:49.485
Is this the hospitality
of a friend and ally?

01:50.653 --> 01:52.279
You arrive here unexpectedly

01:52.363 --> 01:54.573
and the first thing
you do is insult me!

01:55.491 --> 01:56.492
Yes.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.662
Forgive me.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.914
Indeed.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.792
I will of course take you
to meet King Olaf.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.293
Thank you.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.212
But first you must
take off your clothes.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.341
What?

02:13.843 --> 02:15.928
Take off your clothes.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.430
Otherwise, you cannot see him.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.379
I wanted to congratulate you.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.173
Thank you, King Harald.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.384
I thought you wanted
to be queen of Norway.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.011
Yes.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.055
But I never said
who I wanted to be king.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.397
Happy days.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.857
Happy days.
Mmm. Yes.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.942
You know, it feels as if
I'm really in a dream.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.944
All my youth
I've had to hide away,

05:19.028 --> 05:21.905
and I couldn't tell
anybody who I was.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.450
But now, at the wedding
of my brother,

05:24.533 --> 05:26.619
Bjorn Ironside!

05:30.789 --> 05:33.459
One of the most famous men
in all the world.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.585
And I have you...

05:34.668 --> 05:37.129
I have you to thank for
that, King Harald.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.882
I mean, you could've
killed me, but you didn't.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.801
And now we're going back to
Kattegat, my father's realm.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.803
I mean, why should
I not be happy, huh?

05:44.887 --> 05:46.388
Be happy!

05:46.472 --> 05:48.682
Drink another horn,
drink several.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.853
Get ready for our journey.
It won't be easy.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.938
Some of our ships
will surely flounder.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.025
Oh, but not mine. No.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.444
See, the gods,
they wouldn't allow it,

06:00.569 --> 06:02.696
'cause I'm a son of
Ragnar Lothbrok. Ah.

06:03.656 --> 06:07.242
And the gods look after me. I mean,
they always did. It's just...

06:07.326 --> 06:08.702
Just I didn't know.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.288
Skol.
Skol.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.753
<i>F fiend.</i>

06:22.383 --> 06:23.634
Congratulations.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.013
I wanted her.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.432
She knew that.
But you prevailed.

06:32.226 --> 06:36.105
It's a virtue of being
a son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.065
I really don't know why.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.693
Of course, you know why.
You're not stupid.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.488
You always wanted
to be Ragnar Lothbrok.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.907
You felt like his equal,
I know that.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.826
Skol.
Ah. thank you.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.079
There was nothing
you couldn't do.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.166
You didn't understand why people
followed Ragnar and not you.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.376
Isn't that true?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.588
But you will never be Ragnar.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.757
And you will never be
king of Norway.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.093
And do you want to know why?

07:06.802 --> 07:08.554
Why don't you tell me?

07:08.637 --> 07:14.393
It has nothing to do with
power, or titles, or your army.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.189
It is in the gift of the gods.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.152
I'm happy for you today, Bjorn.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.903
You married a beautiful woman.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.198
Of course, some would say that

07:28.282 --> 07:32.161
that will be the greatest curse of all.
But I don't believe that.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.581
I envy you.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.624
Envy I understand.

07:39.752 --> 07:41.879
That doesn't stop us
working together.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.089
Or trusting each other.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.468
Does it?
Of course not.

07:49.428 --> 07:53.056
There are far greater things
at stake than just a woman.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.227
Ah, but she is not just
a woman though, is she?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.837
My Lord Olaf. This is...

09:04.920 --> 09:06.880
I know Who it is!

09:08.757 --> 09:11.385
Come and sit down, Hvitserk.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.514
<i>Your brother War</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:18.767
told me he would send you

09:19.017 --> 09:20.227
and so,

09:21.562 --> 09:23.272
I have been waiting.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.110
Give our guest some mead.
Yes. Lord.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.491
Skol.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.036
Skol.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.421
Another son of Ragnar.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.344
That is a sign of...

09:56.138 --> 09:57.556
Respect.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.476
So,

10:01.852 --> 10:04.563
what do you think
of this place so far?

10:11.695 --> 10:12.905
The truth?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.576
I think all this is an illusion,

10:19.411 --> 10:21.705
and you are what they call

10:22.998 --> 10:24.333
"the Buddha."

10:37.471 --> 10:38.639
Move!

10:52.986 --> 10:54.196
Whoa!

10:55.280 --> 10:56.823
Move out
of the way! Move!

10:56.907 --> 10:59.284
- Make way.
- Move! Move!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.371
Get back! Stay back!

11:02.454 --> 11:04.247
Move! You, back!

11:22.516 --> 11:24.393
No. please!
I've done nothing!

11:24.476 --> 11:25.686
Stay back! Move!

11:33.276 --> 11:34.653
Open the door!

11:35.320 --> 11:36.738
Open the door now!

11:58.802 --> 11:59.886
Come.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.059
Please. Sit.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.526
There, I am trying to rule well.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.031
I am trying to rule
for the benefit of our people,

12:20.323 --> 12:23.452
not the strangers, not the
outsiders who threaten us.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.374
I use my divinity
to protect you,

12:30.876 --> 12:32.169
like a father.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.214
But still, you hate me...

12:37.632 --> 12:41.511
You deface my image.
You criticize me.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.515
Why?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.146
In Ragnar's time,
everyone was free.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.648
That's what my parents told me.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.403
They could say what they wanted,
they could do what they wanted.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.948
Ragnar never forced them
to do anything.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.536
And above all,

13:08.497 --> 13:11.208
he never forced them
to worship him.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.253
He knew, he was only human.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.422
Just like the rest of us.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.762
You have spoken well.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.557
Go.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.310
"GO"?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.442
I remember your father.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.529
He is a good man.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.575
One of us.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.495
Go.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.877
I look forward
to traveling to England

13:56.670 --> 13:58.839
and raiding with your brother.

13:58.922 --> 14:03.885
I hear many stories
of his prowess as a warrior.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.932
What kind of a ruler
is your brother?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.268
Is he...

14:11.893 --> 14:13.353
Is he cruel?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.897
Is he a monster?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.608
I need to know.

15:10.994 --> 15:14.080
<i>My brother has
declared himself to be a god.</i>

15:14.706 --> 15:16.791
He's no longer the Ivar I knew.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.251
The brother I knew.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.588
He's a tyrant.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.428
You! Over here!
Put them together!

15:31.348 --> 15:32.557
Thora!

15:32.641 --> 15:34.351
Be quiet!
Father!

15:35.477 --> 15:38.813
And yet you want me to join
him in raiding England?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.651
No.
No?

15:43.652 --> 15:47.364
Would you like to explain?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.990
Over here!

15:49.074 --> 15:50.784
Run! Run! Run!

15:51.576 --> 15:53.453
No!
I cannot let you!

15:55.580 --> 15:56.665
No!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.208
No!

15:59.626 --> 16:01.920
King Olaf, I haven't come here

16:02.003 --> 16:05.757
to ask you to help Ivar recover
York and attack Wessex.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.635
<i>We come here to ask you
to attack N at</i>

16:08.718 --> 16:10.804
and overthrow him
as King of Kattegat.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.555
Hmm.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.724
I understand.

16:16.101 --> 16:21.523
But I probably will go
with my original plan.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.810
King Olaf, listen...

16:59.394 --> 17:00.520
King Olaf!

17:01.104 --> 17:02.272
King Olaf!

18:00.371 --> 18:02.624
You didn't even dig
your daughter's grave.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.376
I thought she became
more your child than mine.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.921
And she was always
too good for you.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.714
You're probably right.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.591
Who knows these things?

18:12.008 --> 18:14.511
You screw a woman.
You have a child.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.805
Who in Hel knows
about that child?

18:17.347 --> 18:18.681
Who cares?

18:23.978 --> 18:26.481
You are the same
as the rest of us, after all.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.191
You were just pretending!

18:29.901 --> 18:31.486
Do it! Do it!

18:33.613 --> 18:36.533
No, Ketill, Iwon't.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.619
The man I once was

18:40.328 --> 18:41.538
would have dug this spade

18:41.621 --> 18:42.997
just deep enough into your skull

18:43.081 --> 18:44.541
to make you unconscious.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.210
And when you woke up,

18:47.335 --> 18:50.547
I would let you witness me
burn your wife alive.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.551
And then I would force
your one remaining son

18:54.634 --> 18:56.469
to cut off your balls
and have you eat them.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.140
And as you slowly bled out,

19:00.223 --> 19:03.810
the last thing you would see
would be me raping your son,

19:03.893 --> 19:05.687
not knowing if I would
show him the mercy

19:05.770 --> 19:07.021
of killing him or not.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.032
But you see,

19:19.784 --> 19:21.494
I won't do any of that.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.790
For even though you

19:25.874 --> 19:27.250
and Eyvind

19:27.333 --> 19:29.711
and everyone else
in this cursed settlement

19:29.794 --> 19:32.463
have showed me that I can't
change other human beings,

19:33.006 --> 19:34.632
I have changed myself.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.261
And I intend to stay this way.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.473
I owe it to the dead.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.397
Do with this place as you like.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.525
I am done with the humans.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.586
Wen, wen,

20:12.629 --> 20:14.297
little wen,

20:16.049 --> 20:20.345
shrink like coal on a hearth.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.350
Wizen like filth on wall!

20:25.892 --> 20:27.477
Waste away

20:28.102 --> 20:30.855
like water in pail!

20:32.148 --> 20:34.359
Become as little

20:36.361 --> 20:39.405
as grain of linseed,

20:42.158 --> 20:43.743
and smaller

20:44.744 --> 20:47.538
than hand-worm's hip bone,

20:49.290 --> 20:52.210
until at last you are

20:53.002 --> 20:56.172
nothing at all.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.429
You must leave.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.182
What?

21:11.604 --> 21:12.939
Who?

21:13.022 --> 21:15.400
She is nothing.
She is nothing.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.943
No concern of yours.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.321
Who is that woman?

21:22.156 --> 21:23.533
She is nobody.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.620
Please, I have told you.
You must leave!

21:27.829 --> 21:29.080
No.

21:30.081 --> 21:31.708
A crazy woman.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.710
I have been looking after her.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.299
Lageflha?

21:39.382 --> 21:40.425
Please...

21:40.508 --> 21:41.676
Lagertha, is that you?

22:12.123 --> 22:13.166
<i>From evil.</i>

22:13.249 --> 22:14.417
<i>From evil.</i>

22:23.384 --> 22:25.720
<i>It gladdens me to know that Odin</i>

22:25.803 --> 22:27.555
<i>prepares for a feast.</i>

22:32.852 --> 22:34.604
<i>Soon I shall be drinking</i>

22:34.687 --> 22:37.148
ale from curved horns!

22:39.275 --> 22:42.904
This hero that comes into Valhalla
does not lament his death.

22:44.614 --> 22:48.201
I shall not enter
Odin's hall with fear.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.289
There I shall wait
for my sons to join me.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.042
And when they do,

22:57.043 --> 22:58.544
I will bask

22:58.920 --> 23:00.922
in their tales of triumph.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.593
The Aesir will welcome me.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.181
My death comes without apology!

23:10.973 --> 23:12.767
And I welcome

23:12.850 --> 23:15.937
the Valkyries to summon me home!

23:16.979 --> 23:20.691
Deliver me,
O Lord, from mine enemies!

23:21.943 --> 23:23.820
Over there! Over there.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.372
No!

23:37.583 --> 23:39.085
<i>I always dream of you.</i>

23:40.837 --> 23:44.132
<i>Last night, I dreamt you were
feeding me blood pudding.</i>

23:46.342 --> 23:47.677
<i>What does that mean?</i>

23:50.555 --> 23:52.890
It means you've given me
your heart.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.481
<i>Ragnar.</i>

24:16.956 --> 24:18.332
Where is this?

24:23.296 --> 24:24.505
Where am I?

24:24.839 --> 24:26.174
The Royal Villa at Wessex.

24:28.801 --> 24:29.927
<i>Wessex.</i>

24:33.806 --> 24:35.057
Ecbe rt.

24:36.642 --> 24:37.768
Yes.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.770
Ecbe rt.

24:53.618 --> 24:56.704
The three Danish kings have
camped about five miles upriver.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.831
They are preparing
to attack as soon as possible.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.833
Then obviously we should
attack them atonoe.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.460
I don't think so.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.545
What possible advantage
do we gain by delaying?

25:04.629 --> 25:06.273
They will very soon discover
that we are here.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.090
I'm sure they already
know we are here.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.178
Then what on Earth
do you propose?

25:12.261 --> 25:14.141
I propose we go down there
and we speak to them.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.973
Speak to them?
That is the best way

25:16.224 --> 25:19.352
to avoid a terrible battle
and unnecessary death.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.079
And how do we know that
you will not just betray us,

25:21.103 --> 25:23.481
and join them?
You don't.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.525
But if you want
to overrule your king,

25:25.608 --> 25:28.653
who appointed me the leader
of the army, go ahead.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.060
King Olaf asks if you have
changed your mind.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.104
Will you join him and King Ivar

26:45.187 --> 26:47.231
in attacking England,
as you agreed?

26:47.315 --> 26:48.941
I wish I could agree.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.987
This Is a ridiculous way to die.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.906
Too hot in a cold climate.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.409
I'm sure you appreciate
the irony.

26:58.784 --> 26:59.952
I love irony.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.663
But still, death is death.

27:02.747 --> 27:05.583
That's true.
Not really a laughing matter.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.253
But I'm decided
against my brother.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.798
The King must
make up his own mind.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.135
I thought he agreed with me.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.182
You must never try to anticipate
the desires of kings.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.561
I thought you, of all people, might
have understood that by now.

28:41.929 --> 28:45.808
Ubbe!

28:45.891 --> 28:50.020
Ubbe!

28:55.443 --> 28:57.903
You see? You're famous.

28:57.987 --> 29:01.323
Ubbe!

29:15.713 --> 29:17.339
Yes. Yes.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.988
The head! One more.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.591
What is it?

30:02.259 --> 30:03.886
You have a son, King Ivar.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.348
I have a son.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.683
I have a son.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.143
Give me my baby.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.603
He will not be able

30:12.728 --> 30:14.230
to take the milk
from your breast.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.856
What are you talking about?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.316
Give me my baby.

30:24.698 --> 30:25.699
Oh.

30:26.617 --> 30:29.203
My beautiful little Baldur.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.498
My little god.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.670
<i>Show War NS Messed son.</i>

30:38.295 --> 30:40.965
Yes.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.385
Give me my son.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.065
My divine Baldur.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.652
I've waited for this...

31:03.862 --> 31:05.447
Did I not tell you,

31:05.531 --> 31:08.576
and did you not believe me
when I said that

31:08.659 --> 31:12.204
deformity is a true sign
of the gods' favor?

31:22.881 --> 31:26.385
Ubbe!

31:43.193 --> 31:44.528
Ubbe.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.405
Son of Ragnar.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.699
Welcome.

31:50.326 --> 31:52.411
My name is King Hemming.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.913
And here are King Angantyr
and King Frodo.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.209
Of all the enemies
we expected to encounter,

31:59.293 --> 32:01.670
we could hardly have imagined
encountering you.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.340
I am not your enemy.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.102
Let us go and drink.
Let me explain.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.773
Lagertha, Queen of Vikings,

32:21.523 --> 32:23.192
we welcome you back to Wessex,

32:23.275 --> 32:25.736
to the Royal Villa of my
grandfather, King Ecbert.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.159
We were so very glad
to find you alive.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.829
Thank you, King Alfred.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.458
Thank all of you.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.091
Ubbe and Torvi have gone
to fight a Danish army

32:47.174 --> 32:48.842
at the borders of our kingdom.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.597
And I heard my son has gone
to attack Ivar in Kattegat.

32:54.431 --> 32:55.724
Mmm.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.393
Life moves on,

32:57.685 --> 32:59.436
whether or not
we are a part of it.

33:02.398 --> 33:03.774
Everything changes.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.238
As I have changed.

33:11.073 --> 33:14.493
I am no longer Lagertha,
shield maiden,

33:15.160 --> 33:17.246
since my shield is gone.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.460
I have nothing
to protect myself with.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.922
Only yourself

33:28.132 --> 33:29.967
and your honesty.

33:32.761 --> 33:35.973
Sweet Judith,
do you think that is enough?

33:38.267 --> 33:40.144
I don't understand.

33:40.227 --> 33:41.937
You're leading a Saxon army

33:42.020 --> 33:43.300
on behalf of the King of Wessex?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.398
Yes.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.276
We had made
an alliance with him.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.820
Before you and your people
even got here.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.823
But they are our enemies.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.242
Why did you make
an alliance with our enemies?

33:56.118 --> 33:57.828
Sometimes it's sensible
to make deals

33:57.911 --> 34:00.205
when you have
long-term goals to achieve.

34:00.414 --> 34:02.708
Perhaps women understand
that more than men.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.295
Men just go and fight
and kill each other,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.589
and only afterwards realize
they didn't need to.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.216
There were better alternatives.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.261
Who is this woman?

34:15.637 --> 34:18.056
A shield maiden. Torvi.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.558
My Wife.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.523
Is there much more
you need to know, King Frodo?

34:23.979 --> 34:25.898
What is the fruit
of your alliance?

34:28.776 --> 34:30.110
King Alfred of Wessex

34:30.194 --> 34:32.946
has granted us a large area
of land in his kingdom.

34:34.323 --> 34:36.200
It was always my father's dream

34:36.283 --> 34:38.327
to establish a working
settlement here.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.413
What does that mean to us?

34:42.331 --> 34:45.083
If your armies are willing
to give up the sword,

34:45.334 --> 34:48.212
then you can move into the
lands in East Anglia at once.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.839
Instead of dying uselessly
on the battlefield,

34:51.507 --> 34:53.300
your warriors
and your shield maidens

34:53.383 --> 34:54.968
can take up
the plow and the loom,

34:55.052 --> 34:56.678
and they can make a life here.

34:57.638 --> 34:59.139
There is nothing to stop you.

34:59.223 --> 35:01.934
And yet, you have
everything to gain.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.691
What is the name of that stone?

35:11.401 --> 35:14.071
Lapis lazuli.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.449
Where does it come from?

35:19.493 --> 35:21.036
Somewhere far away,

35:21.453 --> 35:23.330
along the Silk Roads.

35:25.332 --> 35:30.045
Blue is the most expensive
of all the pigments,

35:30.128 --> 35:33.382
which is why we reserve it
for the Virgin Mary.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.342
It's an incredible color.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.302
It shines.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.347
As the moon shines

35:40.430 --> 35:42.850
in the reflected light
from the sun,

35:43.350 --> 35:47.354
so Mary shines in the
reflected light from her son,

35:48.272 --> 35:49.565
Jesus Christ.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.737
I think you will have a son.

35:57.447 --> 36:01.118
As you, Lagertha, have a son,
and I, two sons.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.623
Although I murdered one of them.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.502
And now I am dying.

36:12.129 --> 36:13.797
No!
Yes.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.969
I have a lump in my breast.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.806
I know other women
have died from such a thing.

36:25.267 --> 36:28.395
It seems that you no longer
have your shield either.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.650
No.

36:35.152 --> 36:37.863
And no experience learned

36:37.946 --> 36:39.740
can compensate for it.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.825
I can't bear it!

36:44.077 --> 36:48.248
You are young.
You can bear anything.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.931
You've been a warrior like me.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.142
In your own way.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.565
But I don't agree with you.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.906
There are still many things
for us to discover...

37:24.576 --> 37:26.912
on the other side
of the shield wall.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.294
It seems we might have
to fight our way out of here.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.463
If we have to fight
our way out of here,

37:36.546 --> 37:38.590
then we will do it together.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.886
And if the odds are against us,

37:42.970 --> 37:46.598
then it will make me happy
to die with you.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.021
Ineverthought I would
hear a woman say that.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.523
Oh.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.899
Everyone can be wrong.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.484
- Ubbe.
- Even you.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.072
Two of us
want to avail ourselves

38:02.155 --> 38:04.866
and our warriors
of your offer. But...

38:06.034 --> 38:08.537
King Frodo refuses to agree.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.540
He wants to continue the raid.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.625
Then there is only
one thing left to do.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.338
I take your refusal as an insult

38:19.131 --> 38:21.216
and I challenge you
to a single combat.

38:21.299 --> 38:25.470
Good. This makes me
very happy, Ubbe Lothbrok.

40:03.735 --> 40:04.861
Give.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.198
Sympathize.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.159
Control.

40:13.537 --> 40:16.164
I have decided

40:16.248 --> 40:18.333
to go with you after all

40:18.792 --> 40:22.838
and attack Ivar's kingdom.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.340
Good?

40:28.677 --> 40:32.681
Let us talk a little while
together, you and I, my son.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.601
I waited for you a long time.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.771
I thought you would make

40:40.856 --> 40:42.440
everything perfect,

40:43.316 --> 40:45.485
because you would be like a god,

40:46.736 --> 40:48.154
the shining one,

40:48.655 --> 40:49.948
like Baldur.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.498
That was my dream.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.003
But it was only a dream.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.052
You are not divine,

41:13.013 --> 41:15.348
because you remind me of myself.

41:16.391 --> 41:20.145
And you would continue to remind
me, and everyone else of...

41:20.228 --> 41:21.479
Of what I am.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.652
And you see,
I cannot let that happen.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.408
I cannot allow you to suffer

41:34.993 --> 41:37.370
like I have suffered
throughout my life.

41:42.626 --> 41:45.253
How can I do that
to you? Hmm?

41:51.551 --> 41:54.804
What kind of a father
can do that to a son?

41:58.391 --> 41:59.517
To any son?

42:07.984 --> 42:09.152
No.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.616
No.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.210
I cannot help you anymore.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.755
You'll have to make
your own way in life, Baldur.

42:31.633 --> 42:32.884
My boy.
