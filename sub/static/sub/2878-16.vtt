WEBVTT

00:04.336 --> 00:06.550
Gentlemen, I think
I've come up with a

00:06.551 --> 00:09.318
fun way to get young people
interested in science.

00:10.037 --> 00:13.006
Physics Mad-Libs.

00:14.541 --> 00:16.809
- Now, give me a number.
- Five.

00:16.811 --> 00:18.311
Uh-huh.

00:18.313 --> 00:20.596
And an irrational constant.

00:20.598 --> 00:22.265
"E."

00:22.267 --> 00:23.850
And a funny Greek letter.

00:23.852 --> 00:25.068
Gamma.

00:25.070 --> 00:26.769
I said funny.

00:26.771 --> 00:28.738
Upsilon?

00:28.740 --> 00:30.106
Good one.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.892
And an electrical charge.

00:32.894 --> 00:34.193
Positive.

00:34.195 --> 00:35.528
(laughs) Perfect.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.563
SHELDON:
Okay. Get this.

00:37.565 --> 00:38.865
(clears throat)

00:38.867 --> 00:42.401
"Professor Jones told the
symposium he had a new method

00:42.403 --> 00:45.204
"for calculating
the mass of a muon.

00:45.206 --> 00:50.960
Five times the limit of (laughs)
'E' to the upsilon as..."

00:50.962 --> 00:52.178
(laughing)

00:53.380 --> 00:54.847
(clearing throat):
Okay. No, no.

00:54.849 --> 00:55.848
I'll start over.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.100
"Professor..."

00:57.102 --> 00:58.267
(cracking up)

01:00.304 --> 01:02.271
I haven't seen him
laugh that hard

01:02.273 --> 01:05.257
since the day Leonard
made that multiplication error.

01:05.259 --> 01:07.927
Oh, Oh, Lord, that
multiplication error!

01:07.929 --> 01:09.645
(laughing): He thought
he carried the one.

01:09.647 --> 01:10.947
But he didn't.

01:10.949 --> 01:12.665
(laughing)

01:12.667 --> 01:13.900
It's not funny.

01:13.902 --> 01:15.318
That mistake got published.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.037
Stop! I'm going to wet myself!

01:18.039 --> 01:21.273
Hey, guys, guys, President
Siebert is headed this way.

01:21.275 --> 01:22.942
I wonder
what he wants.

01:22.944 --> 01:24.077
Doesn't look happy,
so I'm guessing

01:24.079 --> 01:25.244
he wants to talk to Sheldon.

01:25.246 --> 01:26.278
Dr. Cooper?

01:26.280 --> 01:27.113
Told ya.

01:27.115 --> 01:28.498
Oh, President Siebert,

01:28.500 --> 01:32.051
I assume you'd like to respond
to one of the suggestions

01:32.053 --> 01:33.719
I put in the box by your office.

01:33.721 --> 01:37.123
No, and stop installing
suggestion boxes everywhere.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.509
You don't like
written suggestions.

01:39.511 --> 01:41.310
You don't like when I give them
to you while we're urinating

01:41.312 --> 01:43.012
in the men's room.

01:43.014 --> 01:45.064
If I didn't know you any better,
I'd say that you're one of those

01:45.066 --> 01:47.967
stubborn people
who are not open to suggestions.

01:47.969 --> 01:50.803
Dr. Cooper, the physics
department chair tells me

01:50.805 --> 01:52.405
you're refusing
to take your vacation.

01:52.407 --> 01:54.073
I don't need a vacation.

01:54.075 --> 01:55.324
You're obligated to take one.

01:55.326 --> 01:57.410
And I'd also like you to know
the most-often received

01:57.412 --> 02:00.079
suggestion in my suggestion box
you installed without asking me

02:00.081 --> 02:02.849
is "Can Dr. Cooper
take a vacation?"

02:03.750 --> 02:04.984
Okay, settled, then.

02:04.986 --> 02:07.703
I'll see y'all of you Monday,
except for you.

02:07.705 --> 02:09.088
But if I don't come into work,

02:09.090 --> 02:10.539
what am I supposed
to do with myself?

02:10.542 --> 02:12.875
Read, rest, travel.

02:12.877 --> 02:15.962
I hear Afghanistan
is nice this time of year.

02:17.831 --> 02:19.549
Sarcasm?

02:19.551 --> 02:21.634
No. You should go.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.832
(sighs)

03:18.834 --> 03:20.500
What the hell are you doing?!

03:20.502 --> 03:23.253
Bleeding from my ears.

03:23.255 --> 03:25.221
What are you doing
hiding back there?

03:25.223 --> 03:26.506
I'm sneaking into work.

03:26.508 --> 03:28.808
Now, if the guard
at the university asks

03:28.810 --> 03:29.959
what's under the blanket,

03:29.961 --> 03:32.395
you tell him
it's some lobster traps.

03:32.397 --> 03:34.731
- Lobster traps?
- Yes.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.016
That's how Velma and Scooby

03:36.018 --> 03:38.801
smuggled Shaggy
into the old lighthouse.

03:38.803 --> 03:42.072
What are you going to do when
you get to the university?

03:42.074 --> 03:43.823
People are going
to recognize you.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.077
Will they, Leonard?

03:50.748 --> 03:54.034
Fine. Just get back
under your blanket,

03:54.036 --> 03:55.368
and I'll drive you there.

03:56.787 --> 03:58.288
And no more singing.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.992
Fine.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.931
SHELDON: <i>I have GPS on my phone.</i>

04:07.933 --> 04:10.800
<i>I know you turned around.</i>

04:11.936 --> 04:14.220
I'm so glad you
talked Howard

04:14.222 --> 04:17.673
out of having your wedding
invitations in Klingon.

04:17.676 --> 04:20.660
Turn it over.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.565
I'm hoping my relatives
think it's Hebrew.

04:27.485 --> 04:29.653
(sighs) This is
really happening.

04:29.655 --> 04:31.237
I'm gonna be a maid of honor.

04:31.239 --> 04:34.057
I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress
and walk down that aisle

04:34.059 --> 04:38.128
and, finally, I will
have my special day.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.946
You mean my special day?

04:39.948 --> 04:43.917
They're gonna need an extra-
large veil for somebody's head.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.253
If I ever actually
ever get married.

04:47.255 --> 04:48.371
Why wouldn't you?

04:48.373 --> 04:49.723
My dad...

04:49.725 --> 04:51.508
'Cause I make a lot more
money than Howie,

04:51.510 --> 04:53.843
he's putting a lot of pressure
on me to get a prenup.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.211
Ouch.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.647
Yeah. Howie's gonna freak out.

04:57.649 --> 04:59.349
Parental pressure
can be daunting.

04:59.351 --> 05:03.186
I remember the battle with my
mother about shaving my legs.

05:04.188 --> 05:06.940
Last year, I finally gave in
and let her do it.

05:08.993 --> 05:11.828
I just don't know how I'm gonna
break it to him.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.496
You know, I'm a big believer
in breaking bad news

05:13.498 --> 05:14.781
to a guy when you're
in bed with him.

05:14.783 --> 05:16.533
That's how I told
my high school boyfriend

05:16.535 --> 05:18.201
I slept with his brother.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.755
That's how I told
his brother the same thing.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.959
I don't know, I don't want
to manipulate him with sex.

05:25.961 --> 05:28.478
Oh, sweetie,
that's what sex is for.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.680
You know, the connection

05:30.682 --> 05:32.432
between marriage and money
is nothing new.

05:32.434 --> 05:35.418
In fact, the term "wed" referred
to the money and livestock

05:35.420 --> 05:37.353
that the groom paid
the bride's father.

05:37.355 --> 05:38.388
For example,

05:38.390 --> 05:39.556
you're adorable,

05:39.558 --> 05:40.890
intelligent
and a good earner.

05:40.892 --> 05:42.859
I could conservatively see
you going for

05:42.861 --> 05:45.061
at least two oxen and a goose.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.315
You would fetch
a unicorn.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.655
Sheldon, there are a million
great vacations you could take.

05:55.657 --> 05:57.040
What about Hawaii?

05:57.042 --> 06:01.878
Hawaii is a former leper colony
on top of an active volcano

06:01.880 --> 06:05.582
where the disappointing ending
to <i>Lost</i> was filmed.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.620
Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.

06:10.622 --> 06:12.138
How about Florida?

06:12.140 --> 06:13.406
They got Cape Canaveral,

06:13.408 --> 06:15.391
they got Disney,
they got my Aunt Ida

06:15.393 --> 06:18.144
and the world's largest
collection of diabetic candy.

06:18.146 --> 06:19.562
Plus, if you get sweaty enough,

06:19.564 --> 06:22.849
her plastic-covered furniture
is like a flume ride.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.986
My family took a trip
to Florida when I was a child.

06:26.988 --> 06:31.241
A seagull stole a hot dog
from me on the beach.

06:31.243 --> 06:32.442
I got the message.

06:34.245 --> 06:36.312
You know, if I had a week off,
I'd go back

06:36.314 --> 06:38.531
to the Two Bunch Palms Resort
and Spa in the desert.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.950
I tell you, an hour on the
massage table with Trevor,

06:40.952 --> 06:44.487
and you'll feel like
you were born without bones.

06:44.489 --> 06:48.675
I don't think I could ever
let a guy give me a massage.

06:48.677 --> 06:50.794
Really? What was I doing
to your neck last night

06:50.796 --> 06:52.445
while you were playing X-Box?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.549
It's like I'm living
in a dictatorship.

06:56.551 --> 06:58.885
"You must take a vacation,
you must have fun,

06:58.887 --> 07:02.055
you must enjoy life."

07:02.057 --> 07:04.958
I don't think you have
a good handle on dictatorships.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.977
Sheldon, everybody
takes vacations.

07:07.979 --> 07:10.613
One time they tried to make
Richard Feynman take a vacation,

07:10.615 --> 07:13.032
but he chose instead
to expand his mind

07:13.034 --> 07:14.200
and learn something new.

07:14.202 --> 07:16.619
He went to work
in his friend's biology lab.

07:16.621 --> 07:19.539
Richard Feynman was a famous
American physicist,

07:19.541 --> 07:20.957
part of the Manhattan Project.

07:20.959 --> 07:25.628
Everyone in the world of science
knows who Richard Feynman was.

07:25.630 --> 07:26.830
Now you do, too.

07:29.967 --> 07:32.502
Oh! I have a
brilliant idea.

07:32.504 --> 07:35.622
Amy's a biologist.
I'll go work in her lab.

07:35.624 --> 07:38.057
Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

07:38.059 --> 07:39.759
Ten seconds ago, you
never heard of him.

07:39.761 --> 07:41.194
Now you're an expert.

07:44.899 --> 07:45.849
Hey.

07:45.851 --> 07:47.567
- Hey, you.
- Is that your laundry?

07:47.569 --> 07:49.385
You only have, like,
six things in there.

07:49.387 --> 07:50.720
Yeah, I didn't have
any quarters,

07:50.722 --> 07:52.355
so I've been sneaking stuff

07:52.357 --> 07:54.440
into other people's
loads all day.

07:54.442 --> 07:55.742
Hey, if I tell
you something,

07:55.744 --> 07:57.660
will you promise
not to tell anybody?

07:57.662 --> 07:59.746
It doesn't matter what I say,
you're gonna tell me anyway.

07:59.748 --> 08:03.416
What? That
is not true.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.587
Bernadette wants
a prenup.

08:07.589 --> 08:10.256
Wow. That's rough.

08:10.258 --> 08:13.176
So you're saying if I
became a famous movie star,

08:13.178 --> 08:15.178
we got married,
you wouldn't sign a prenup?

08:15.180 --> 08:16.846
Absolutely not.

08:16.848 --> 08:19.432
If I'm gonna be stuck
at home with the kids

08:19.434 --> 08:20.516
while you're on location

08:20.518 --> 08:23.753
cheating on me
with Ryan Gosling...

08:23.755 --> 08:26.472
then Leonard gots
to get paid.

08:27.358 --> 08:30.443
So, you think
about us getting married?

08:30.445 --> 08:32.361
I think about
a lot of things.

08:32.364 --> 08:33.763
I think about us
getting married,

08:33.765 --> 08:35.148
I think about us
breaking up.

08:35.150 --> 08:36.783
Once in a while, I think

08:36.784 --> 08:38.650
about how I didn't leave
a note on that Mercedes

08:38.653 --> 08:40.203
I dinged in the parking
lot last month,

08:40.205 --> 08:42.538
but then I have a glass of wine
and it passes.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.742
Joke all you want,
but you think about it.

08:45.744 --> 08:47.443
Well, tell you
one thing,

08:47.445 --> 08:50.463
if I ever do get married,
no Klingon invitations.

08:50.465 --> 08:54.350
Good luck catching a man
with that attitude.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.787
Boy, oh, boy!

08:57.789 --> 09:00.623
This vacation is off
to a wonderful start.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.343
The smell of formaldehyde...

09:04.261 --> 09:06.512
the whir of the centrifuge,

09:06.514 --> 09:08.631
the distant chatter
of lab animals

09:08.633 --> 09:10.633
being dispatched
for dissection.

09:10.635 --> 09:15.438
Mm, I can already feel
my cares just melting away.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.240
I'm excited to work
with my boyfriend.

09:17.242 --> 09:18.307
It's gonna be romantic.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.860
Way to kill the mood.

09:20.862 --> 09:22.745
Come on, Sheldon.

09:22.747 --> 09:25.114
We can be like Marie Curie
and her husband, Pierre,

09:25.116 --> 09:27.450
who spent their days working
side by side,

09:27.452 --> 09:29.452
bathed in the glow of their love
and the radium

09:29.454 --> 09:31.204
that ultimately killed her.

09:32.122 --> 09:33.873
Screw <i>Beauty and the Beast;</i>

09:33.875 --> 09:35.992
<i>that's</i> the love story
Disney should tell.

09:35.994 --> 09:38.995
Okay, what do we start with?

09:38.997 --> 09:42.465
Maybe splicing some
genes, clone a sheep,

09:42.467 --> 09:45.051
perhaps grow a human ear
on a mouse's back?

09:45.053 --> 09:47.553
Ha-ha, I'm a freak!

09:49.857 --> 09:51.140
Oh, I'm gonna
be doing

09:51.142 --> 09:52.225
some brain stem histology

09:52.227 --> 09:55.194
while you put yourself
on the business end

09:55.196 --> 09:57.313
of a sponge
and wash those beakers.

09:57.315 --> 09:59.232
Wash those bea...

09:59.234 --> 10:03.019
Oh, I get it, a little
hazing for the new fella.

10:03.021 --> 10:05.154
Yeah, I'd better keep
and eye out for, what,

10:05.156 --> 10:06.706
shoe polish on
the microscope,

10:06.708 --> 10:09.659
or mad cow disease in my
grilled cheese sandwich?

10:09.661 --> 10:11.411
No, I just need
those beakers washed.

10:11.413 --> 10:12.829
Hippity-hop,
quick like a bunny.

10:12.831 --> 10:15.197
Wha...? Excuse
me, you have

10:15.199 --> 10:16.883
Dr. Sheldon Cooper
in your lab.

10:16.885 --> 10:18.251
You're gonna make
him do the dishes?

10:18.253 --> 10:20.136
That's like asking
the Incredible Hulk

10:20.138 --> 10:22.338
to open a pickle jar.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.642
Sheldon, you've never worked
in a lab like this before.

10:26.644 --> 10:29.228
You have no experience
in the field of biology.

10:29.230 --> 10:31.647
I have plenty of
experience in biology.

10:31.649 --> 10:34.650
I bought a Tamagotchi
in 1998.

10:34.652 --> 10:35.768
And...

10:35.770 --> 10:37.236
it's still alive.

10:37.238 --> 10:38.738
Let's do this.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:49.227 --> 10:51.428
- Where's Howard?
- No "Hi, Raj"?

10:51.430 --> 10:52.980
No "How are you, Raj?"

10:52.982 --> 10:55.733
Just straight to "Where's the
other white guy?"

10:55.735 --> 10:57.467
I'm sorry.

10:57.469 --> 10:58.852
So, listen,

10:58.854 --> 11:00.521
I heard something about him.

11:00.523 --> 11:02.439
Can you keep it between us?

11:02.441 --> 11:03.807
Ooh, gossip.

11:03.809 --> 11:06.160
When I first got here,
I thought you Americans

11:06.162 --> 11:07.861
really gossiped around
the water cooler.

11:07.863 --> 11:09.813
So I hung out there
for, like, a month,

11:09.815 --> 11:12.366
but the only gossip I ever heard
was about some creepy guy

11:12.368 --> 11:14.585
hanging out by the water cooler.

11:15.653 --> 11:18.072
Bernadette wants
to get a prenup.

11:18.074 --> 11:21.008
Oh, that's a shame--
he's gonna be devastated.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.043
I never know what to do
in these situations.

11:23.045 --> 11:24.545
Should I give
him a heads-up?

11:24.547 --> 11:27.014
Hmm. I'm gonna
give you the same advice

11:27.016 --> 11:30.184
I yell at the TV when the
Bachelor's handing out roses.

11:31.686 --> 11:34.171
Follow your heart.

11:35.273 --> 11:36.807
Check it out.

11:36.809 --> 11:38.675
Look at the size of that

11:38.677 --> 11:39.843
Rice Krispie Treat!

11:39.845 --> 11:41.779
Same price. (chuckles)

11:41.781 --> 11:44.281
Hey, Howard, I need
to tell you something.

11:44.283 --> 11:46.116
I know, it's not
on my wedding diet.

11:46.118 --> 11:48.035
I don't care.

11:49.454 --> 11:51.822
Uh, l-listen, I...

11:51.824 --> 11:55.042
heard that Bernadette's thinking
about asking you for a prenup.

11:56.327 --> 11:58.412
A prenup?

11:58.414 --> 12:00.414
(laughs) Wow.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.316
What are you gonna do?

12:02.318 --> 12:05.936
I... don't know.

12:05.938 --> 12:08.188
Follow your heart.

12:14.012 --> 12:17.314
You know what, it's...
not a big deal.

12:17.316 --> 12:19.733
She makes more money than me.

12:19.735 --> 12:23.270
She wants to protect
her financial interests.

12:23.272 --> 12:25.322
It's completely reasonable.

12:25.324 --> 12:26.657
Good. That's a healthy attitude.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.642
Yeah, actually,
it's good for both of us.

12:28.644 --> 12:30.160
I have assets to protect, too.

12:30.162 --> 12:32.312
Like what?

12:32.314 --> 12:34.397
I've got some rare comic books.

12:34.399 --> 12:37.084
The Vespa's almost paid off.

12:38.269 --> 12:41.038
And Ma and I have a primo double
cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai

12:41.040 --> 12:43.941
right near the guy who played
Mr. Roper on <i>Three's Company.</i>

12:43.943 --> 12:47.094
Mr. Roper's dead?!

12:48.880 --> 12:51.849
You can't just spring
that on a guy!

12:53.051 --> 12:55.018
Here you go.

12:55.020 --> 12:56.854
This is now
the only lab

12:56.856 --> 12:59.556
with glassware washed
by a man with two doctorates

12:59.558 --> 13:03.110
and a restraining order
signed by Carl Sagan.

13:03.978 --> 13:05.779
Soap spots. Wash 'em again.

13:05.781 --> 13:07.815
Y... You're
being ridiculous!

13:07.817 --> 13:09.783
Those are perfectly clean.

13:09.785 --> 13:12.769
Sheldon, this beaker used
to contain cerebral spinal fluid

13:12.771 --> 13:15.038
from an elephant
that died of syphilis.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.657
If it's, in fact,
perfectly clean,

13:16.659 --> 13:17.991
drink from it.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.134
Biologists are mean.

13:28.469 --> 13:30.254
All right,
perhaps this task

13:30.256 --> 13:32.389
will be a little bit
more up your alley.

13:32.391 --> 13:34.411
I need you to count
the bacteria spores

13:34.436 --> 13:35.459
on these petri dishes.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.644
There was something wrong
with that detergent.

13:37.646 --> 13:39.980
That was way too bubbly.

13:39.982 --> 13:41.598
I'm sure it was.
I intend to write

13:41.600 --> 13:44.434
that soap company
a strongly worded letter.

13:44.436 --> 13:46.987
Yeah, good for you.
Now, start counting.

13:47.972 --> 13:49.940
You know what this place needs?

13:49.942 --> 13:52.309
A suggestion box.

13:53.444 --> 13:56.079
366...

13:56.081 --> 13:58.065
367...

13:58.067 --> 13:59.433
How's it going?

13:59.435 --> 14:01.001
How's <i>counting</i> going?

14:01.003 --> 14:02.536
When I was in
kindergarten,

14:02.538 --> 14:05.205
I recited pi
to a thousand places

14:05.207 --> 14:07.207
for the school talent show.

14:07.209 --> 14:09.293
I think I got this.

14:09.295 --> 14:10.377
Great.

14:15.266 --> 14:17.134
Aw, nuts!

14:20.004 --> 14:22.356
One...

14:22.358 --> 14:25.292
This is preposterous!

14:25.294 --> 14:26.894
I think you're
giving me these tasks

14:26.896 --> 14:28.462
because you're afraid
if you give me

14:28.464 --> 14:30.814
anything meaningful to do,
I'll show you up.

14:30.816 --> 14:33.734
Really?
Is that what you think?

14:33.736 --> 14:35.235
Yes, that's what I think.

14:35.237 --> 14:39.022
And I'm super smart,
so it's probably true.

14:39.024 --> 14:40.741
Hey, I've been training
in the field

14:40.743 --> 14:42.159
of neurobiology for 12 years.

14:42.161 --> 14:43.710
You've been here
for three hours,

14:43.712 --> 14:46.196
and you've spent one of them
in the bathroom.

14:46.198 --> 14:48.382
I'm sorry!
It takes me a while

14:48.384 --> 14:51.335
to get things going
on an unfamiliar toilet.

14:51.337 --> 14:53.837
Sheldon, I've given you
the simplest things to do,

14:53.839 --> 14:56.056
and you haven't done
one of them right.

14:56.058 --> 14:57.891
Maybe that's because
I'm not being challenged.

14:57.893 --> 15:00.543
It's the same reason
Einstein failed math.

15:00.545 --> 15:02.729
Maybe the math was
too bubbly for him.

15:02.731 --> 15:05.349
You think you're doing science
by cutting up that brain?

15:05.351 --> 15:07.768
They could do the same
thing at any Quiznos.

15:07.770 --> 15:11.571
<i>And</i> they'd offer
to toast it for me, too.

15:11.573 --> 15:12.856
Okay, smart guy.

15:12.858 --> 15:15.192
I'm about to remove
the locus coeruleus,

15:15.194 --> 15:17.778
which is incredibly
delicate work.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.413
Have at it.

15:20.915 --> 15:22.416
All right.

15:23.401 --> 15:26.569
I'm no stranger to
a little gray matter.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.842
Locus coeruleus.

15:34.412 --> 15:37.180
Locus coeruleus.

15:37.182 --> 15:40.467
You're getting warmer--
it is, indeed, in the brain.

15:42.220 --> 15:43.420
Hope your hands
are steady.

15:43.422 --> 15:45.355
It's the width
of a single hair.

15:45.357 --> 15:47.819
But this is just biology,
so I'm sure it's no problem

15:47.844 --> 15:48.860
for a genius like you.

15:48.861 --> 15:51.528
It's not. I'll have you know,
in the field of physics,

15:51.530 --> 15:53.196
we work with particles so small,

15:53.198 --> 15:56.083
they make fat jokes
about the locus coeruleus.

15:57.601 --> 16:00.287
I.e., when your locus coeruleus
sits around the house,

16:00.289 --> 16:02.939
it sits <i>around</i> the house.

16:07.045 --> 16:09.629
Oh... are we nervous,
Dr. Cooper?

16:09.631 --> 16:11.164
No.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.782
What you see

16:12.784 --> 16:16.169
is a man trembling
with confidence.

16:20.258 --> 16:22.893
Does a locus coeruleus
normally bleed that much?

16:22.895 --> 16:25.529
No. But your thumb does.

16:28.016 --> 16:30.017
Oh, dear.

16:33.121 --> 16:36.823
Yeah, <i>you're</i> a biologist.

16:40.144 --> 16:42.329
What are you doing here?

16:42.331 --> 16:44.281
I'm on vacation.

16:44.283 --> 16:46.083
Social convention dictates

16:46.085 --> 16:49.453
that I let my hair down
at a local watering hole.

16:52.006 --> 16:54.541
Social convention is stupid.

16:55.493 --> 16:57.961
What happened
to your thumb?

16:57.963 --> 16:59.829
You know, I have
ten fingers and ten toes.

16:59.831 --> 17:02.182
If I tell you a story
about each one of them,

17:02.184 --> 17:04.468
we'll be here all day--
let's just move on.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.269
What can I get you?

17:06.271 --> 17:08.972
Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation,

17:08.973 --> 17:11.391
uh, piña colada
seems appropriate.

17:11.393 --> 17:14.176
Extra pineapple slices,
extra whipped cream,

17:14.179 --> 17:16.363
extra cherries, extra umbrellas,

17:16.365 --> 17:18.665
and, uh, hold the rum.

17:19.867 --> 17:23.203
Don't let me have
too many of those.

17:23.204 --> 17:24.871
Hey, what are you
guys doing here?

17:24.873 --> 17:28.023
We're grown men;
we drink at bars.

17:28.026 --> 17:30.660
No and no.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.498
Everything okay
with you and Bernadette?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.550
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah, sure.

17:36.552 --> 17:38.218
You and Amy? Good?

17:38.220 --> 17:40.420
Oh, better
than good.

17:41.406 --> 17:42.939
You know those girls text me

17:42.941 --> 17:45.208
every detail of their lives
as it happens.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.644
I'm not signing a prenup.

17:47.646 --> 17:49.429
All right, Howard Wolowitz,
listen up.

17:49.431 --> 17:51.932
You sign anything
she puts in front of you,

17:51.934 --> 17:53.767
because you are
the luckiest man alive.

17:53.769 --> 17:55.235
If you let her go,
there is no way

17:55.237 --> 17:57.404
you can find anyone else--
speaking on behalf of all women,

17:57.406 --> 17:59.439
it is not gonna happen;
we had a meeting.

18:01.742 --> 18:03.110
And you, a grown man

18:03.112 --> 18:05.890
fainting at the sight
of a little blood.

18:05.915 --> 18:06.730
Excuse me,

18:06.731 --> 18:09.616
this is a fairly
substantial wound.

18:09.618 --> 18:11.168
You...

18:11.170 --> 18:13.286
(heavy thud)

18:15.773 --> 18:18.408
(light tapping)
SHELDON: Amy? Amy?

18:18.410 --> 18:20.410
Amy?

18:21.629 --> 18:23.463
What do you want?

18:23.465 --> 18:27.551
I was kind of hoping
I could continue vacationing

18:27.553 --> 18:29.186
in your laboratory.

18:29.188 --> 18:32.389
After all, I did book
the whole week.

18:33.524 --> 18:36.593
Do you honestly think you
can just waltz back in here

18:36.595 --> 18:38.278
after the way
you behaved yesterday?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.814
I was not myself.

18:40.816 --> 18:44.484
I had lost a lot of thumb blood.

18:45.536 --> 18:47.287
That's not an apology.

18:47.289 --> 18:49.723
That is your opinion.

18:49.725 --> 18:52.125
I want a real apology.

18:53.494 --> 18:56.746
I'm sorry that you
weren't able to...

18:56.748 --> 18:58.331
No.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.333
...that my genius...

19:00.335 --> 19:01.585
No.

19:01.587 --> 19:03.170
...that the
soap was...

19:03.172 --> 19:04.888
Sheldon.

19:07.341 --> 19:08.842
Fine.

19:11.479 --> 19:13.930
Sorry.

19:13.932 --> 19:15.798
You're forgiven.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.269
Now, if you want to stay,
get started on those beakers.

19:19.271 --> 19:21.771
They're still dirty
from yesterday.

19:25.276 --> 19:27.494
Next year I'm
going to Epcot.

19:37.889 --> 19:39.923
Are you mad at me?

19:39.925 --> 19:41.925
No. I'm not
mad at you.

19:41.927 --> 19:43.060
I just...

19:43.062 --> 19:44.678
wish you would have come to me,

19:44.680 --> 19:48.865
so I didn't have to hear it
through the nerd-vine.

19:50.217 --> 19:51.944
So, what are
we gonna do?

19:51.969 --> 19:53.169
(sighs)

19:53.188 --> 19:55.555
You really want me
to sign a prenup?

19:55.557 --> 19:56.690
I don't know.

19:56.692 --> 19:59.242
My dad's pretty insistent
on it, though.

19:59.244 --> 20:02.496
Why don't I talk to
your dad, man-to-man?

20:02.498 --> 20:05.064
Really?
Oh, that'd be so great!

20:05.066 --> 20:06.700
Done.

20:06.702 --> 20:10.454
I should probably give you a
heads-up about a couple of things.

20:11.839 --> 20:13.790
Even though he's retired
from the police force,

20:13.792 --> 20:15.425
he still carries his gun.

20:16.828 --> 20:18.378
But don't worry,
he won't shoot it.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.597
It's more
of a fashion statement.

20:21.849 --> 20:23.216
Okay.

20:23.218 --> 20:26.085
And just to be safe,
when you talk to him,

20:26.087 --> 20:28.472
don't bring up Jimmy Carter,
gardeners,

20:28.474 --> 20:30.390
foreign people, homosexuals,

20:30.392 --> 20:32.793
Sean Penn, Vatican II,
gun control, organic food,

20:32.795 --> 20:34.762
the designated hitter rule,
recycling or the fact

20:34.787 --> 20:36.087
that you're Jewish.

20:39.266 --> 20:41.568
Got it, got it.

20:41.570 --> 20:44.955
Will you e-mail me
that list?

20:44.957 --> 20:47.207
So the thing
to watch for,

20:47.209 --> 20:48.992
if he's shouting at you,
you're okay,

20:48.994 --> 20:50.961
but if he starts
to get real quiet,

20:50.963 --> 20:53.997
leave as quickly as you can
without making eye contact.

20:55.616 --> 20:59.669
Not in a straight line-- throw
some zigs and zigs in there.

21:01.506 --> 21:03.507
You know, this
isn't that pressing.

21:03.509 --> 21:06.092
Why don't I talk to him
about it in May.

21:06.094 --> 21:09.179
In May you're gonna be on
the International Space Station.

21:10.230 --> 21:11.696
They got a phone.

21:11.698 --> 21:15.698
