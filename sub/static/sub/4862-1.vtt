WEBVTT

00:30.614 --> 00:32.281
What am I gonna do?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.658
Oh, shit.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.284
You have to get it now?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.842
Why does everything
happen to you first?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.469
Here, take these.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.107
You took Ma's heels?

01:06.275 --> 01:08.484
Like she's ever worn anything twice.

01:09.153 --> 01:12.029
Besides, you should be
more worried about her finding out...

01:12.197 --> 01:15.992
- how old your skanky boyfriend is.
- Does your boyfriend have a car?

01:16.160 --> 01:17.994
I'm sorry,
do you even have a boyfriend?

01:18.162 --> 01:20.037
Maybe I don't want a boyfriend.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.148
No way.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.649
Nice.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.445
You're officially a woman.
Let's fucking celebrate.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.033
Derek, did Marie tell you
that she's not wearing any underwear?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.162
Really?

02:06.210 --> 02:08.669
I hope that runs in the family.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.652
Are you just gonna hang around...

02:32.820 --> 02:35.238
or are you actually gonna
buy something this time?

02:38.909 --> 02:41.077
Hey, honey, you're looking
in the wrong section.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.913
The Women's section
is on the other side.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.144
I want what he's wearing.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.591
Oh, dude.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.178
- Who am I?
- Elvis.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.181
No, man.
I'm the fucking Glycerine Queen.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.726
Suzi Quatro.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.229
- I'm the fucking wild one.
- Yeah!

04:31.021 --> 04:33.105
Mom's gonna kill you.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.818
- It really looks terrible.
- Good.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.865
Crap.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.285
Here, let me help you.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.581
Fuck.

05:35.043 --> 05:38.504
My brother says that guys
don't like girls that are tough.

05:38.672 --> 05:43.759
He says guys like girls
that are soft and flirty.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.138
Yeah, he would say that.
He's a pussy.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.599
He does spend a lot of time
doing his bangs.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.303
Next contestant,
from Mrs. Morgan's 10th grade class...

06:27.471 --> 06:30.222
Cherie Currie performing
"Lady Grinning Soul."

07:25.529 --> 07:26.529
Nice pants!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.415
Yeah!

08:20.125 --> 08:21.917
- Sit down.
- Love you, Cherie!

08:22.085 --> 08:24.295
You suck.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.005
- I love it!
- Freak.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.090
You go, Cherie!

08:31.011 --> 08:33.179
We love you!

08:35.682 --> 08:37.600
Stay up there, Cherie!

08:40.352 --> 08:41.645
Sit down now, please.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.652
- Cherie!
- She's going off.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.825
Just keep working on those scales.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.870
- I'll see you next week.
- Okay. See you.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.623
Joan Larkin.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.796
It's Jett. Joan Jett.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.175
Come on in, Joan Jett.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.428
All right. Here.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.224
Okay. Well, let's get started.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.352
- So what kind of amps you guys got?
- Amps?

09:21.519 --> 09:24.688
Well, why don't we just keep it
unplugged for now, okay?

09:25.148 --> 09:26.857
All right. A...

09:27.025 --> 09:31.070
Well, I wanna play, like, Chuck Berry,
you know, "Johnny B. Goode"?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.072
Why don't we just start
with a G chord?

09:33.281 --> 09:36.408
A G chord to a C, to a D.
How's that?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.119
G chord, like that.

09:39.454 --> 09:43.666
On top of Old Smokey

09:43.833 --> 09:46.418
All covered with snow

09:46.586 --> 09:48.128
Now we're gonna go to a D.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.340
I lost my poor sweetheart

09:51.508 --> 09:52.508
To the G.

09:52.676 --> 09:56.512
From courting too slow

09:57.180 --> 10:00.015
- You see that? Did you see...?
- "Old Smokey"?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.393
That one's goofy, man.

10:02.686 --> 10:06.272
I mean, at least teach me "Smoke on
the Water." I know you know that one.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.692
Girls don't play electric guitars.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.699
On top of Old Smokey

10:16.866 --> 10:20.911
- All covered with snow
- Covered with slow

10:21.079 --> 10:23.664
I dumped my poor sweetheart

10:23.832 --> 10:26.208
For screwing too slow

10:27.377 --> 10:29.378
That's not funny, Miss Larkin.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.381
I can teach you to play the guitar,
but you're gonna have to...

10:32.549 --> 10:35.634
Excuse me, what are you doing?
Excuse me?

10:35.802 --> 10:38.887
Excuse me, I don't think
you ought to do that right now.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.270
Turn that off, please. Turn it off.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.359
Hello?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.069
Happy birthday, kitten.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.781
Hey, Daddy. I saved you the best piece
of cake, the one with my name on it.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.741
- Know why?
- Tell me.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.035
Because guess who ruled
the school talent show.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.579
- You?
- Yeah.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.457
Well, me and David Bowie.
But when are you gonna get here?

11:48.625 --> 11:52.044
The cake's gonna melt and Mom says
there's no room left in the freezer.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.881
Well, I can't, kitten.
I got... I gotta stay late tonight.

11:56.049 --> 12:00.260
I'm sorry. I'll be by tomorrow, promise.
I only have a few minutes, though...

12:00.428 --> 12:03.931
so why don't you let me
say hi to the other kitten.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.974
Marie's out with her friends.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.726
What, you didn't wanna go?

12:07.894 --> 12:12.314
- No.
- Okay. Well, give her a pet for me.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.024
I love you, kitten.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.026
Love you too, Daddy.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.174
Yeah. So wacky though, right?

12:39.342 --> 12:42.344
- No. I could do all right.
- Right there, that's right.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.096
- You gonna go dance?
- I don't know.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.182
- You like it strong, don't you?
- Yeah, I like it...

12:56.651 --> 12:58.318
No, I can't.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.989
- It's too much.
- This is fine, okay?

13:27.265 --> 13:29.725
All right. Let's keep it going all night.

13:29.893 --> 13:34.855
Here is more
supersonic sounds of London.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.984
Yeah!

14:12.268 --> 14:14.061
That's Kim Fowley.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.355
You see that guy over there?
That's...

14:16.773 --> 14:18.649
He's a famous record producer.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.030
This is Dick Johnson.
He'd like to produce you.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.826
Well, tell Little Richard to heel,
all right?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.787
No?

14:31.955 --> 14:33.288
Just...

14:33.456 --> 14:34.623
stay.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.210
So he got really in.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.340
You need a cab or something?

14:43.508 --> 14:44.883
No.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.594
Yeah.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.973
- He's...
- You're Kim Fowley?

14:53.977 --> 14:57.729
I am the King Hysteria himself.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.648
And let me guess,
you sing in a band...

14:59.816 --> 15:01.900
and it's the greatest band
in the world...

15:02.068 --> 15:04.486
and I am the luckiest dog fucker
in outer space...

15:04.654 --> 15:06.989
because I get to hear it first, right?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.159
I'm Joan Jett.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.620
I play...

15:14.372 --> 15:16.748
I play guitar. Electric guitar.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.587
Joan Jett, that's a cool name.
You guys got a demo?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.173
No.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.050
No, I don't...

15:27.218 --> 15:29.845
No guys.
I wanna start an all-girl rock band.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.640
Really?

15:34.142 --> 15:37.269
Maybe I am the luckiest
dog fucker after all. Hey, Sandy.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.896
Hold on, I'll be right back.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.859
Sandy West is a drummer.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.070
Joan Jett claims to be
some sort of guitar goddess.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.449
Well, I didn't say that goddess thing.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.077
No, no, it's cool, man. These guys are
talking about going to some party...

15:54.245 --> 15:57.623
on the south side. it's supposed
to be bitchen. You wanna go?

15:59.042 --> 16:01.209
No, I mean, I can't tonight.
But we should jam.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.419
- Yeah.
- You play drums?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.713
Yeah, let's play.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.176
See what kind of noise you two make,
call me if you have something...

16:09.344 --> 16:12.179
that won't make me regret
giving you my number, okay?

16:12.347 --> 16:13.805
Okay.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.058
Cool, so we'll play.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.395
Hey.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.275
Okay, I get it. Yeah, that's enough.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.946
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Joan?

16:30.448 --> 16:31.573
Hello?

16:31.741 --> 16:34.826
Pick up the phone!

16:35.787 --> 16:38.080
- Dog meat!
- Hi, sorry.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.833
Hey, what the fuck
you girls been doing over there?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.753
Well, we've been practicing, man,
like you said.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.588
Oh, yeah?

16:47.173 --> 16:48.215
Well, get back to it.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.510
You bitches are gonna be bigger
than the fucking Beatles.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.055
- Cool.
- Yeah.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.100
All right.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.601
Let's do it.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.145
Ready? One, two, three.

17:05.775 --> 17:09.694
- Hello, Mrs. West. ls Sandy home?
- Oh, God.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.170
Tougher, tougher, tougher.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.799
Come on.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.801
I mean, come on,
this is really good music.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.512
There's nothing like this on the radio.
There's nothing.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.472
Elvis and Priscilla got divorced...

17:37.932 --> 17:39.391
the president is a prowler...

17:39.559 --> 17:42.894
and all these housewives
talk to their fucking plants.

17:44.105 --> 17:47.649
Now, you dogs need to get dirty.
All those little fuck boys out there...

17:47.817 --> 17:50.360
are wearing dresses
and leaving their lipstick...

17:50.528 --> 17:53.321
on each other's cocks, okay?

17:53.489 --> 17:56.283
Now, I wanna hear you
fuck girls growl!

18:06.753 --> 18:10.172
Halt.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.508
I know what we're missing.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.678
- I know what we need.
- What are we missing?

18:25.188 --> 18:26.229
Bitchen.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.854
Hey, I like your pants.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.606
Thanks.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.801
Kim Fowley, record producer.
You've heard of me.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.387
Have I?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.139
I like your style.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.226
A little Bowie, a little Bardot.
A look on your face that says:

19:46.394 --> 19:49.104
"I could kick the shit
out of a truck driver."

19:49.272 --> 19:50.355
Joanie.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.941
This is Joan Jett.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.693
And you are?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.112
- Cherie.
- Cherie.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.531
- Cherie what?
- Currie.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.492
Cherie Currie.
Is that your real name?

20:04.161 --> 20:07.956
Well, Cherie Currie, do you sing
or play a musical instrument?

20:11.335 --> 20:14.129
Yeah. Yeah, I can sing.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.464
I won a talent show
lip-synching to David Bowie.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.675
- Why?
- "Why?"

20:19.969 --> 20:23.305
Asked the maybe-great
Cherie Currie.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.639
Read my lips.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.434
We love your look.

20:27.602 --> 20:32.063
We are choosing you
to be a part of rock 'n' roll history.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.441
Do you wanna be in a band?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.235
Are you kidding?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.822
You know any Suzi Quatro?

20:41.490 --> 20:42.699
- Yeah.
- Good.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.743
Learn one of her songs,
don't care which.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.621
Audition's Saturday.
Joan will tell you where.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.166
How old are you?

20:51.792 --> 20:53.501
Fifteen.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.713
Jail-fucking-bait. Jack-fucking-pot.

20:59.342 --> 21:02.052
So we practice in a trailer
in the Valley.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.554
- It'll probably happen there.
- Okay.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.849
Come find me.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.754
Crap.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.950
- Oh, hold on.
- Tempo.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.038
- Well, I don't know what...
- Cherie Currie. Cherie Currie.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.623
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.625
You look great.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.045
What song are you going to
sing for us today?

23:00.212 --> 23:01.963
- "Fever."
- "Fever."

23:02.131 --> 23:03.631
Peggy Lee song?

23:03.799 --> 23:06.468
- Who's Peggy Lee?
- My mom likes Peggy Lee.

23:06.635 --> 23:10.180
Kim, you should have told her.
We don't play that shit.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.474
Suzi Quatro covered "Fever."

23:12.641 --> 23:16.478
It's a slow song.
We don't play slow songs.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.317
Well, can you do a different song?

23:23.569 --> 23:26.154
Yeah... it's just the only one
that I learned for today.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.572
Go.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.075
Wait outside. Go.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.618
Go.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.208
Joan, come here. Bring your guitar.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.339
We'll just have to do it for her,
I guess.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.343
Cherie Currie.

23:49.553 --> 23:53.098
- She's a wild child. She's a wild girl.
- Yeah.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.058
She's a wild girl.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.851
She's a...

23:57.686 --> 23:59.521
She's a firecracker.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.191
Give me something else.
Something else. Firecracker, rocket.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.068
Rocket, bomb. Bomb.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.112
Cherry bomb. Cherry bomb.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.404
Cherry bomb.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.907
Just... Do it again. Do it.

24:12.493 --> 24:16.621
She's a cherry bomb

24:17.498 --> 24:19.040
- That's good.
- Yeah.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.922
Cherry bomb. All right.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.174
Hello, Daddy

24:28.342 --> 24:29.926
Hello, Mom

24:30.094 --> 24:34.097
I'm your cherry bomb

24:36.767 --> 24:38.059
- That's nice.
- Right? Yeah.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.395
Yeah.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.987
Hey, "His Majestic Hysteric" whatever
is ready for you now.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.281
All right? Yeah.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.369
Hello, Daddy

24:56.537 --> 24:57.745
Hello, Mom

24:57.913 --> 25:01.040
I'm your cherry bomb

25:01.542 --> 25:02.750
Hello, world

25:02.918 --> 25:04.544
I'm your wild girl

25:04.712 --> 25:07.463
I'm your cherry bomb

25:07.631 --> 25:09.424
Okay, you do it. Let's go.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.886
Hello, Daddy

25:13.053 --> 25:14.095
Hello, Mom

25:14.263 --> 25:17.599
I'm your cherry bomb

25:17.766 --> 25:18.933
Hello, world

25:19.101 --> 25:20.602
I'm your wild girl

25:20.769 --> 25:24.063
I'm your cherry bomb

25:24.231 --> 25:28.109
Hey, street boy Want some style?

25:28.527 --> 25:32.447
Your dead-end dreams
Don't make you smile

25:33.199 --> 25:36.284
Hey, street boy Want some style?

25:36.452 --> 25:39.412
Your dead-end dreams
Don't make you smile

25:39.580 --> 25:42.582
I'll give you something
To live for

25:42.750 --> 25:46.294
Have you, grab you
Until you're sore

25:46.629 --> 25:48.463
I can't say that.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.549
What? Oh, okay. Goodbye.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.969
Go sell Girl Scout Cookies.
Who's next?

25:59.183 --> 26:00.975
Come on, just do it.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.310
It's just a song.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.733
I'll give you something
To live for

26:08.901 --> 26:11.152
Have you, grab you
Till you're sore

26:11.320 --> 26:12.695
No, dog shit.

26:12.863 --> 26:16.407
Dog shit. Urine-soaked dog shit.
Okay, listen...

26:17.368 --> 26:21.120
rock 'n' roll is a blood sport.
It is a sport of men.

26:21.288 --> 26:24.791
It is for the people in the dark.
The death cats.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.459
The masturbators.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.170
The outcasts who have no voice,
no way of saying:

26:29.588 --> 26:31.256
"Hey, I hate the fucking world.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.592
My father's a faggot.
Fuck you! Fuck authority!

26:34.760 --> 26:37.011
I want an orgasm."

26:37.763 --> 26:39.430
Now growl. Moan.

26:39.598 --> 26:44.894
This isn't about women's lib, kiddies.
This is about women's libido.

26:45.062 --> 26:49.857
I want to see the scratch marks
down their fucking backs.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.860
All right, do it again. Again. Like...

26:54.446 --> 26:58.032
Like your sister just fucked
your boyfriend in your parent's bed.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.869
Like you want a fucking orgasm.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.205
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:10.004 --> 27:13.881
I'll give you something
To live for

27:14.049 --> 27:17.593
Have you, grab you
Till you're sore

27:17.761 --> 27:19.345
Hello, Daddy

27:19.513 --> 27:20.680
Hello, Mom

27:20.848 --> 27:24.559
I'm your cherry bomb

27:24.727 --> 27:26.102
Hello, world

27:26.270 --> 27:27.812
I'm your wild girl

27:27.980 --> 27:30.982
I'm your cherry bomb

27:31.150 --> 27:33.151
That's getting pretty good.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.569
That's great. Yeah.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.571
- What do you think, ladies?
- Yeah.

27:36.739 --> 27:38.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.575
- I like it.
- Quite a presence.

27:42.077 --> 27:46.748
Oh, now, don't get cocky.
We have a lot of work left to do.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.086
Hey, foxy, come here!

27:59.595 --> 28:01.262
- Check it out.
- What?

28:01.430 --> 28:02.805
Donny Osmond.

28:02.973 --> 28:05.600
Destroy that shit.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.108
Come on.

28:15.486 --> 28:17.362
Oh, shit.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.500
I wanna go back.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.339
My mom's gonna kill me.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.966
Don't you guys
have any kind of curfew?

28:39.635 --> 28:41.094
I don't.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.346
My dad split. He was the strict one.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.139
Yeah, mine too.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.768
He didn't really leave,
he was kicked out and replaced.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.481
Do you take the garbage out
now too?

28:53.690 --> 28:56.109
Yeah, me and my sister.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.819
Yeah, me too.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.531
What is this?

29:01.698 --> 29:03.950
It ain't baby shampoo.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.619
I call it the dirty sink.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.164
A little bit of everything
from my parent's liquor cabinet...

29:10.332 --> 29:13.751
but just a little so they can't tell
I'm dipping into their stash.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.838
My dad would notice.
He likes his booze.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.756
He an alcoholic?

29:19.425 --> 29:22.343
No, he just likes it.
He says that's the difference.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.179
He likes to drink,
he doesn't need to drink.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.932
I like to drink.

29:28.559 --> 29:31.602
A dirty sink is where we're gonna be
puking that up tomorrow.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.691
Hey, salt and pepper.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.526
Race you down the hill.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.070
- Let's go.
- Come on.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.952
Oh, my God.

29:54.668 --> 29:58.087
What, you think because you're a big
rock star you can smoke in the house?

29:58.255 --> 30:00.673
Shut up.
I never said I was a rock star.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.050
Can those girls even play?

30:03.802 --> 30:07.889
Yeah.
They actually wrote a song about me.

30:09.391 --> 30:12.393
You know how many new bands
think they're gonna make it?

30:13.604 --> 30:16.147
- Kim thinks we have a real shot.
- Kim Fowley?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.691
That guy's a total creep.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.737
Seriously. I heard he has a coat
made out of dog fur.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.072
Excuse me
if I don't wanna wind up...

30:25.240 --> 30:27.950
working at the Pup 'n Fries
for the rest of my life.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.661
It's Mom.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.248
Crap!

30:34.416 --> 30:36.542
- Come on.
- Places, everybody.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.670
Places. Come quickly,
I have the most wonderful news.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.839
What's all the commotion about?

30:42.633 --> 30:44.091
Well, we're moving to lndonesia.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.927
- What?
- What do you mean?

30:46.094 --> 30:47.553
- What do you mean "we"?
- Well...

30:47.721 --> 30:51.599
- You're leaving? You're leaving us?
- No, no. Nobody's leaving anybody.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.976
We're a family.
We'll always be a family.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.355
This is just something
that we have to do right now.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.773
Why?

30:58.941 --> 31:01.234
I'll be outside.

31:04.613 --> 31:08.866
Wolfgang and I are getting married
and he lives in lndonesia.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.619
You girls are welcome
to come along.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.206
I've spoken to your father and he says
you're welcome to stay at Aunt Evie's.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.208
Where are we gonna sleep
at Aunt Evie's?

31:17.376 --> 31:20.711
He bought you a brand-new
sleeper sofa, top of the line.

31:21.463 --> 31:22.797
It's really not that bad.

31:22.965 --> 31:26.467
- Why can't we at least just stay here?
- Because you're 15 years old.

31:26.635 --> 31:29.804
Just calm down.
This is a transition, not a tragedy.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.973
- We're all gonna be fine.
- Stop saying "we."

31:32.140 --> 31:34.684
There's no "we," there's a "you."
Hasn't been a "we"...

31:34.851 --> 31:37.770
since you kicked Dad out
for leaving water rings on the furniture.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.313
Don't be so dramatic, Cherie.

31:39.481 --> 31:43.150
Oh, coming from the actress.
"Places. Places, everyone."

31:58.542 --> 32:00.042
No.

32:00.335 --> 32:05.548
No. Pig stink, okay?
They're gonna eat you alive out there.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.801
Rock 'n' roll music is tough music
played in tough venues.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.304
Men don't wanna see women
anywhere...

32:11.471 --> 32:14.849
except in their kitchens
or on their knees...

32:15.017 --> 32:18.311
let alone on stage holding guitars,
okay?

32:18.478 --> 32:21.397
Now, you better buckle up
and get ready for boot camp, babies...

32:21.565 --> 32:25.651
because you're gonna get trained
like the Viet-fucking-cong. Bring it in.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.030
Okay, filthy pussies.
Today is hecklers drill.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.282
These degenerates here
are not your fans.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.993
They're not here to tell you
how pretty you look.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.370
They don't want
yourfucking autograph.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.039
They wanna hurt you.

32:38.206 --> 32:41.083
They want you to retreat. You don't.

32:43.086 --> 32:47.381
Now, move it, move it. I wanna see
you bitches do the death dance. Play!

32:50.719 --> 32:52.928
Incoming!

32:53.305 --> 32:54.889
Hey.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.183
What are you gonna do about it,
huh?

32:57.601 --> 32:59.226
- Yeah!
- Hey, watch it.

33:00.771 --> 33:02.188
Oh, did that hurt?

33:02.356 --> 33:03.481
Come on, Joanie.

33:04.358 --> 33:05.816
Hey, man!

33:08.737 --> 33:11.364
Hey! Rat piss.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.493
Dog shit, razor blades.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.374
Watch it.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.584
Oh, man!

34:13.217 --> 34:16.429
Man, I can barely hear you.
They're doing a gig right now.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.389
Killing it. Listen.

34:25.981 --> 34:29.984
You hear that?
That's the sound of hormones raging.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.320
Cherie Currie.
Cherry bomb, sex kitten.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.322
Brigitte Bardot in a trailer park.

34:35.489 --> 34:38.367
Joan Jett, the rock 'n' roll heart,
street-tough brunette.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.120
Sandy West, Miss California
with a joint in her mouth...

34:41.288 --> 34:42.663
and a chip on her shoulder.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.623
Lita Ford, love child of Sophia Loren
and Ritchie Blackmore.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.418
You do not wanna fuck with Lita.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.338
Robin Robins, the brainy brainiac
who's rolling thunder on the bass.

34:54.551 --> 34:58.012
It's incredible.
When do you need the press kits by?

34:58.722 --> 35:00.556
Oh, no problem.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.850
- I'll have it to you then.
- Hey.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.773
Cops!

35:08.940 --> 35:10.983
Oh, shit. The cops? Let's split.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.777
- Hey.
- I gotta go.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.697
Come on. Hey, Terri, wake up.
The cops are here.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.867
- Shit, the cops. Let's go!
- Holy shit.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.369
Come on. Fuck.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.831
Hey. Fucking hecklers drill
really worked.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.751
This girl threw a bottle at my face,
smashed it back at her.

35:28.919 --> 35:32.463
You did the death dance in there. You
showed those punks how to cockfight.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.381
Did you get the money
for the concert?

35:34.549 --> 35:36.008
- No, you played for free.
- What?

35:36.176 --> 35:38.135
Takes money
to make money in this business.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.888
- Wanna play living rooms or stadiums?
- Stadiums.

35:41.056 --> 35:44.016
I racked up their phone bill
booking your tour overseas.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.559
- Overseas, really?
- Yeah. Easy.

35:45.727 --> 35:49.396
You gotta pay your dues first here on
the road in a van, then come the jets.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.940
- When?
- I don't go on the road.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.734
I'll talk to your keepers. Scatter!

35:58.573 --> 36:00.366
This.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.578
- Can I take this?
- No.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.081
It's my favorite.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.958
When was the last time
you wore this?

36:09.125 --> 36:11.418
Exactly.
I save it for special occasions.

36:13.046 --> 36:15.464
It's not like you're playing
the Shrine Auditorium.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.886
Forget it.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.998
Bye, Grandma.

36:54.296 --> 36:56.463
What's wrong?

36:56.631 --> 37:00.009
Yourfather.
He didn't come home last night.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.635
Oh, well...

37:01.803 --> 37:04.555
he's a big boy,
I'm sure he'll be okay.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.808
I'll call when I get to a pay phone,
okay?

37:21.489 --> 37:23.824
- I love you.
- Don't forget the little people.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.701
You're taller.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.077
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.829
- Scottie, I'm your roadie.
- Cherie.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.456
Nice to meet you.

37:30.624 --> 37:31.874
Thanks.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.919
- Take care of my sister, okay?
- Yeah, you bet.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.922
Dad?

37:40.008 --> 37:41.842
- Dad!
- What's wrong?

37:42.427 --> 37:43.510
Dad?

37:43.678 --> 37:44.803
What happened?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.348
Dad, are you okay?

37:48.850 --> 37:50.351
Dad?

37:53.688 --> 37:55.272
Is he dead?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.232
He's passed out.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.152
Let's go! We gotta hit the road!

38:01.696 --> 38:03.530
Go. I got it.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.366
Are you sure?

38:11.373 --> 38:13.332
Thanks, Marie. I owe you.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.918
Yeah. Call, okay?

38:50.578 --> 38:52.454
Stop it.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.581
Are we there yet?

38:55.834 --> 38:58.085
How much longer?

39:27.449 --> 39:29.533
What the fuck?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.660
What, we're supposed to
share two beds?

39:31.828 --> 39:33.871
I thought we were getting
another room?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.539
Fucking Kim, man.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.626
Hey, look, guys, if you need
an extra bed, I'm right down the hall.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.184
I gotta make a call.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.492
No. No!

40:11.659 --> 40:12.868
No!

40:13.036 --> 40:15.496
- Hey, Robin, come here.
- What?

40:23.838 --> 40:25.672
It's great.
We each have our own room...

40:25.840 --> 40:28.258
and there's a pool with a waterfall
and a wet bar.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.261
- I wish I was there.
- Yeah, me too.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.431
- Next time for sure. I promise, okay?
- Okay.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.518
Did everything go well after I left?

40:37.977 --> 40:41.021
Grandma Oni keeps asking
if Dad's full of dope.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.941
- He looks better.
- Okay.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.901
Cherie, get in. What are you doing?

40:46.069 --> 40:48.153
They're calling me,
so I'm gonna go practice.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.447
- But I'll talk to you soon.
- Get off the phone!

40:50.615 --> 40:52.658
All right. Bye.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.047
Open up, you filthy varmint.

41:12.345 --> 41:15.889
This is compliments
of your non-alcoholic father.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.396
How's he doing?

41:22.564 --> 41:24.231
He's okay.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.737
It's still not working.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.282
Dicks aren't even hard.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.577
- You rubbing?
- Yeah.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.830
I think I'm doing it wrong.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.582
Try using the showerhead.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.502
Now, think about someone
you have a crush on.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.509
It's still not working.

41:55.597 --> 41:58.682
How about Farrah Fawcett?
You like her?

41:59.225 --> 42:00.893
Yeah, who doesn't?

42:04.439 --> 42:05.939
Wait, I think I feel something.

42:14.616 --> 42:17.117
Oh, shit.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.079
Check. Check. One.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.313
What the fuck? Plug me back in.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.942
Watch your mouth, kid, or we'll have
to turn you over to Child Services.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.361
Fuck you, old man.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.406
Hey, what's your fucking problem,
man?

42:56.574 --> 42:58.450
What's your fucking problem, man?

42:58.618 --> 43:00.410
Hey, hey, I wouldn't.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.829
- It's a lose-lose situation.
- How's that?

43:02.997 --> 43:06.416
Well, if you win, you beat up a girl.
If you lose, you get beat up by two.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.502
Teenage ones.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.921
All right, sound check is canceled.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.006
Maybe if you ever headline
you'll get one.

43:13.174 --> 43:14.925
Now, why don't you
go to your rooms...

43:15.093 --> 43:17.427
and do your fucking homework
or something?

43:17.595 --> 43:18.845
Like we need a sound check.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.973
Pretty soon you'll be
opening up for us.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.600
Opening your legs, maybe.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.544
- Dude, it really hurts. it really hurts.
- Come on.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.717
Oh, shit.

43:58.219 --> 44:02.472
You guys, come on, open up.
I gotta take a piss. Please?

44:04.058 --> 44:06.893
I really gotta piss, man. Come on.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.738
It's too perfect.

44:20.700 --> 44:25.787
Hey, these jerk-offs
have betterfood than we did.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.581
Yeah.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.584
You gotta pee, right?

44:31.711 --> 44:33.211
Here.

44:33.546 --> 44:35.464
Pee in this shit.

44:35.923 --> 44:38.091
What are you doing, man?

44:38.259 --> 44:41.762
- You can't pee on their guitar.
- I don't give a fuck.

44:43.848 --> 44:47.476
No, I do, actually.
It'll probably add to their sound.

44:48.269 --> 44:50.062
Oh, shit. There's someone in here.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.647
- Where's your belt?
- Shit.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.321
Come on, man. Just come on.

44:59.489 --> 45:01.156
Thank you.

45:04.077 --> 45:08.413
Whoa, you fucking filthy dog.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.500
Hey, we're on in 10.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.878
Hey, up or down?

45:15.046 --> 45:16.671
Down, girl.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.340
Next up on stage...

45:18.508 --> 45:22.844
from Los Angeles, California,
the Runaways.

47:03.613 --> 47:08.575
Kim, we are fucking rocking it.
I mean, the crowd's been really great.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.995
- I hear you're tearing things up.
- We're running out of money though.

47:12.163 --> 47:14.122
We're fucking hungry.
Can you send us more?

47:14.290 --> 47:17.250
It's a bad time. I'm with
an A & R scout, it could be big.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.628
You just keep those dogs in line,
okay?

47:19.795 --> 47:22.255
Things are happening, trust me.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.383
Okay.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.094
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.056
- Just send us some more money...
- I can't come, Joan.

47:31.224 --> 47:34.351
I get vertigo when I travel
and my gimpy leg acts up.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.394
Maybe I can get a road manager.

47:36.938 --> 47:38.271
Kim.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.570
Yeah.

47:58.334 --> 48:00.168
Put that back.

48:01.170 --> 48:03.588
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:03.756 --> 48:06.633
- Off!
- I like that song.

48:36.872 --> 48:39.624
All right.
Now I'm gonna introduce Joan Jett...

48:39.792 --> 48:42.419
with "I Love Playing With Fire!"

51:54.695 --> 51:57.030
Hey, kid. Wake up.

51:57.198 --> 51:59.324
I've got some bad news.

52:03.746 --> 52:05.872
Fucking Kim, man.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.249
- He snaked us.
- What?

52:08.876 --> 52:12.796
All his bullshit
about paying your dues...

52:12.963 --> 52:16.299
that's how you're gonna get
a record deal, blah-fucking-blah...

52:17.968 --> 52:19.302
he was right.

52:21.806 --> 52:22.889
We fucking did it.

52:24.225 --> 52:25.725
- What?
- That Frankenstein...

52:25.893 --> 52:28.228
crazy-looking motherfucker did it.

52:29.230 --> 52:32.732
Mercury fucking Records.
Mercury fucking Records.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.068
- We got signed?
- Yup.

52:35.236 --> 52:38.696
We're going to Hollywood in an hour.
I'm gonna tell the rest of the girls.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.615
Get your little ass ready.

52:51.210 --> 52:53.545
I can't believe it. We got signed.

52:53.712 --> 52:56.422
Hello? Hey. Got a bag?

52:57.842 --> 52:59.968
We got signed!

53:02.471 --> 53:03.930
Yeah.

53:04.098 --> 53:07.517
Yeah, and you know,
I was gonna form a band of dwarves...

53:07.685 --> 53:11.020
but their hands were too small,
they couldn't hold their instruments.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.022
These ladies
can hold their instruments.

53:13.190 --> 53:14.607
And their liquor.

53:14.775 --> 53:18.111
See, girls nowadays,
they don't have any role models.

53:18.279 --> 53:23.616
This band's about self-empowerment.
Aphrodite, Cleopatra, Eurydice.

53:23.784 --> 53:25.243
No more second-class status...

53:25.411 --> 53:28.788
sitting at boring concerts
with their asshole boyfriends.

53:28.956 --> 53:32.750
The Runaways have the most chance
of any group I've seen...

53:32.918 --> 53:34.502
to do what The Beatles did...

53:34.670 --> 53:37.505
to tearthis world apart.

54:33.187 --> 54:36.105
It means "thank you very much"
in Japanese.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.525
I could do everyone's hair and makeup
on tour. What do you think?

54:40.027 --> 54:42.320
Everyone does their own hair
and makeup, you know?

54:42.488 --> 54:46.699
Yeah. Okay, well, I had another idea
about making bags for everybody.

54:46.867 --> 54:52.330
Like silver clutches
with their names on them.

54:55.334 --> 54:57.543
I'm not going, am I?

54:57.711 --> 55:00.046
- I'm not going to Japan.
- I didn't say that.

55:00.214 --> 55:03.716
I'm your sister, Cherie, you don't
have to say it. I can hear you.

55:04.426 --> 55:07.387
It's just that no one really brings
their family, you know?

55:07.554 --> 55:10.223
We don't have the cash,
and we don't need the distraction.

55:10.391 --> 55:12.392
I wouldn't be a distraction,
I'd be a help.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.894
- I know.
- You promised.

55:16.021 --> 55:19.399
So, what then?
Am I supposed to stay here again?

55:19.566 --> 55:23.319
Making tacos? Playing nurse?
Taking out the garbage?

55:26.907 --> 55:28.574
I gotta go.

56:25.466 --> 56:27.175
Not until you get this song down.

56:27.342 --> 56:30.803
Now take it again from the chorus.
One, two, three.

56:37.436 --> 56:40.271
Oh, you hideous souls...

56:40.439 --> 56:43.316
may we not grow old and horrid.

56:43.484 --> 56:45.318
And dreadful.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.488
What are you laughing at?

56:48.655 --> 56:52.867
You think you can sing like that in
front of people? In front of a customer?

56:53.994 --> 56:57.038
You bitches have got to start thinking
like men, okay?

56:57.206 --> 57:00.458
No more snip snails
and puppy dog tails. Men wanna fuck.

57:00.626 --> 57:04.462
Men want this, filthy pugs.

57:04.630 --> 57:08.216
And we're gonna give it to them.
We're gonna put it right in their face...

57:08.383 --> 57:11.594
and then take it back,
just to break their fucking hearts.

57:11.762 --> 57:14.180
Oh, what, Cherie?

57:14.348 --> 57:16.182
I'm sorry.

57:16.683 --> 57:19.060
- Tell me, seriously, are you tired?
- Yeah.

57:19.228 --> 57:20.353
Yeah?

57:20.521 --> 57:22.522
- Are you bored?
- Yeah, actually I am.

57:22.689 --> 57:25.358
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what,
you're not allowed to be tired.

57:25.526 --> 57:27.985
You're not permitted to be bored.
You're an employee.

57:28.153 --> 57:30.446
You are my property
and you will do as I say...

57:30.614 --> 57:34.200
or you can go fold tacos
with your better-looking sister.

57:36.036 --> 57:38.704
Kim, we're a band.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.082
I mean, we don't work for you.

57:41.250 --> 57:43.584
Yeah. Okay, I'm losing my voice,
I'm taking a break.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.879
Oh, little diva.
Well, I got a news flash.

57:47.047 --> 57:50.883
This ain't the opera. They're not
coming to hear your chops, okay?

57:51.051 --> 57:55.805
They're not coming to see little girls
banging on their little drums.

57:56.348 --> 57:58.975
This is the music business, okay?
You wanna be an artist?

57:59.143 --> 58:01.561
Saw offyour fucking ear
and send to your boyfriend.

58:01.728 --> 58:03.896
You wanna be a rock star,
you listen to me.

58:04.481 --> 58:07.233
Okay? Now...

58:08.485 --> 58:10.903
Cherie's lack of greatness...

58:11.071 --> 58:15.491
her lack of rock 'n' roll authority
is getting in the way of our product.

58:15.659 --> 58:18.035
What is our product?

58:18.412 --> 58:20.746
Lita, what's our product, huh?

58:20.914 --> 58:25.251
Sex, violence, revolt.

58:26.253 --> 58:31.507
Okay, now, I'm going to teach you
prima donnas...

58:31.675 --> 58:34.177
how to think with your cocks,
okay?

58:34.344 --> 58:35.928
Get up here.

58:47.149 --> 58:49.859
- Hello?
- Cherie, it's Kim.

58:50.027 --> 58:53.613
I just wanted to call and let you know
I think you're doing a really good job.

58:53.780 --> 58:57.825
And if you keep listening to me,
you're gonna be a big star.

58:57.993 --> 59:01.412
- I'm trying my best, Kim.
- I know you are.

59:01.830 --> 59:04.957
Listen, there's a photographer
coming by your house in 20 minutes...

59:05.125 --> 59:07.793
to take some pictures
for a Japanese magazine.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.837
Twenty minutes?
Is everybody meeting here?

59:10.005 --> 59:13.299
Solo shots. lt'sjust gonna be
you for now. He'll do the rest later.

59:13.467 --> 59:14.800
- So be ready.
- Okay.

59:14.968 --> 59:16.594
Bye, Cherie.

59:18.472 --> 59:20.181
Shit.

59:34.655 --> 59:37.198
Good. Good.

59:47.960 --> 59:51.420
Hey, my arms are connected to me,
you know.

59:53.382 --> 59:54.715
Good.

59:54.883 --> 01:00:08.187
Good, good.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:14.068
No, they're from the magazine.
They're here to take pictures of me.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.070
Get back in the house.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.544
Good morning.
This is your captain speaking.

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:34.588
- Hey, wake up. We're almost there.
- Welcome to Japan.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:38.467
And ifyou're holding any drugs,
get rid of them now.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.511
What?

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.891
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.777
Please take your seats now.
We are preparing for landing.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.791
Two, three.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.310
I can't do any more.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.274
Oh, shit.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:40.363
- I think that means we're landing.
- What?

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.990
- We're not.
- No.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:39.797
Cherie, Cherie, Cherie.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:41.006
This way.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:45.386
Cherie, Cherie, Cherie.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.308
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.394
Did you see that?

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.697
- Japan's not so bad.
- No, man, really, it's great.

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:08.534
I mean, it's bigger than you said.
It's like... it's mania.

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:11.537
I didn't train you
to be a bunch offailure cocks, did I?

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.457
Of course it's going
according to plan.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.379
- Yeah.
- Are you becoming one with Japan?

01:03:21.173 --> 01:03:24.133
I guess so. I mean,
I learned how to use chopsticks.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:28.137
That's my girl. I need you to keep it
togetherfor me over there, Joanie.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.889
I know, I am.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:31.432
I am.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.933
Okay.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.442
What the hell are you wearing?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.611
I'm thinking with my cock.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.239
More like boner.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.909
I think I'm gonna wear it.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:53.537
Where? Strip club?

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.543
You're gonna get us
in a lot oftrouble.

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.254
I mean, like, arrested.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:07.051
Sexy, no?

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:14.767
You're ready for the peep-show circuit.
All you need's a porn name.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.280
Ladies.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:30.491
A toast to the Runaways.

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:37.122
First televised show to over
one million Japanese homes.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.292
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.461
All right.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:47.341
Oh, actually, do you have any beer?

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.267
Excuse me?
Do you like Japanese food?

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:57.726
Yes, very much.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.979
What is your favorite?

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:01.480
- That one.
- That one?

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.316
- Yeah.
- Oh, wasabi.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:05.526
Yeah.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.154
- Hey, you got the cover.
- What?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.990
- Bigger than Godzilla, huh?
- What?

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.826
- Let me see that. Let me see that.
- We got the cover issue.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:16.579
What? Amazing.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:17.788
- Yeah, man.
- Cheers.

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:19.665
- Where'd you get this?
- Took forever.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.333
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.252
We're gonna need another.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.701
- Yeah?
- Hello?

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.494
Cherie, can you hear me?

01:05:57.662 --> 01:06:00.289
- What?
- It's me, Marie.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.750
- Dad's sick.
- Who?

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:06.337
Dad. He's sick.
You gotta come home, okay?

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:09.298
- What?
- Turn down the music. it's me, Marie.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.551
Did you hear what I said?
You have to come home.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.804
I don't have a home.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.892
- Do you have a home?
- What?

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:22.227
What are you talking about?

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.690
Cherie, can you hear me?

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.777
Cherie?

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.721
Wow, it's so crazy.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.765
- Let's eat. You guys hungry?
- Oh, my God.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.935
- Sandy, look at that.
- What? Shit.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.063
Crazy, man.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.899
- What is this?
- What's your problem?

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:58.569
- What's yourfucking problem?
- That is cool.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.446
It's not cool.
Did you know about this?

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:16.628
Kim sent them. Just showed up at my
house. What was I supposed to say?

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:18.797
Well, you could say, "No."

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:23.510
You could say,
"I'm the singer in a band."

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.138
Not Linda fucking Lovelace.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.894
Look at this.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:35.731
When did you do this?

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:39.318
It's exactly what Kim wants.
He's gonna be really happy.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.987
But this is all they're ever
gonna say about us.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:46.158
You think anybody's
gonna take us seriously?

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.161
Son of a bitch. lt'sjust publicity.
It helps everybody.

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:52.205
What were you thinking?
Publicize the music...

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:54.750
not your crotch.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.203
Don't worry about them.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.914
You're the voice.

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:36.541
It's your face on the T-shirts.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.086
You're the one they want.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.867
How you feeling?

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.871
Like a peach.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.839
Like a really bruised peach.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:30.387
There's an all-girl rock band
in Korea now.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.264
Yeah?

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.228
Yeah. The singer thinks she's you.

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.147
They're shit.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:43.734
It's pretty cool, though.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.277
Yeah.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:05.357
Well, if it isn't Mary, mother of God.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.111
What, no disciples?

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.113
No cameras?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.864
Just me.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.828
Nice bag.

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:22.374
So original. All the girls get one?

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.543
No.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.504
Actually...

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.675
there's one for me
and one for you.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.431
Thanks.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:47.065
So do I actually need to say
all the things I wanna say...

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.568
or do we still have
the sister thing?

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.749
How's Dad?

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:08.545
Well, he hasn't asked about you today,
so that's a good thing.

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:11.381
He was worried?

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:12.799
What do you think?

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:16.303
He's been keeping a folder
of all your press clips.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.266
Take it to him.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:25.729
- I'm scared.
- He's been waiting for you.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.631
Hi, kitten.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.008
Hi, Dad.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:19.908
We have money.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.912
You're gonna be fine.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:25.223
We're ready for you, Cherie.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:32.147
Cherie?

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:35.984
I've had it with her shit, man.

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.695
What...? What's wrong?

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:40.739
It must be
a really interesting article.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:42.615
What are you reading?

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:47.579
"Fowley says
handling Cherie's ego...

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:50.248
is like having a dog
urinate in yourface.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:53.501
The best thing that could happen
would be if Cherie hung herself...

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:58.548
from a shower rod and put herself
in the tradition of Marilyn Monroe."

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.759
Shit, man.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.685
That's great. That's fucking right.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.897
- Lita.
- What? it's true.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.441
She's always the center
of every photo.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.944
Always the biggest interview
in all the articles.

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:23.114
It's like we're the backup
for the Cherie Currie Band.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:25.825
I didn't ask for that shit.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:29.204
Who cares?

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:32.749
It's just a magazine article.
It doesn't mean shit.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.501
Let's finish the song. Come on.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:41.883
What's the matter?

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.259
No flash bulbs?

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.637
No one here to fall all over you
while you sing?

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:49.808
Stop. Cherie, bring the bottle.
Come on.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.268
- Cherie?
- Hey, Cherie, listen.

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:55.855
I gotta take a piss. Would that be okay
with you? if not, I could hold it.

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.149
You can piss yourfucking pants
for all I care.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.527
- I'm gonna piss down your throat!
- Calm down!

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:01.903
- Calm down.
- Come on!

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.155
Why are you always defending her,
Joan?

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.491
Bravo, kiddies. Bravo.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.159
What the fuck is this?

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.412
It's pretty nasty, Kim.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.330
This?

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:16.000
This is what we call controversy.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.002
This is what we call publicity.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.005
It's what we call a juicy story!

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.801
Oh, and you're welcome.
By the way, thanks to me...

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:29.389
this article is twice as long
and half of it is about you. Okay?

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:33.601
It's press, my budding young starlet,
not prestige.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.353
Get used to it.

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:37.522
Get in that booth
and finish the song.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:41.359
We've got this place on lockout. I'm
paying out the fucking nose. Let's go.

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:43.027
Let's go. Sing.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:44.863
Sing.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.698
Sing!

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:53.037
- No.
- No?

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.875
No.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.796
- Cherie, we have to finish.
- Yeah, get in the booth, Cherie.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.381
Shut the fuck up, Lita!

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.341
- You shut up.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:08.052
Come on. Cherie, come on.

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:13.057
- I'm not singing.
- Oh, Cherie.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.310
Of course you're singing,
you're a singer.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:19.564
That's what you do. You sing and you
strut around in your underwear, okay?

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.275
But most importantly,
you do what I tell you to do.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:25.945
And right now I'm telling you
to get in the booth, so get in the booth.

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.530
No.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.493
You get in that booth, Cherie.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.286
No.

01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:35.997
Get in the booth
before I lose my patience...

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:38.249
and send you back
where I rescued you from.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.585
Good. Send me back.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:43.588
- I don't give a shit. I wanna go back.
- Careful.

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.468
- Get in the booth.
- No.

01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:50.803
- Get in the booth!
- No!

01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:53.431
I'm not gonna be
your little lap dog anymore.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:55.600
You've been speaking for me
this whole time.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.310
You get in the fucking booth.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:20:59.729
I'm done.

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:32.595
You dog cunts will be lucky to get
a gig singing in the fucking shower.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:12.885
You know what?

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:18.016
Good fucking job! No, really!
Really! Good fucking job!

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:20.518
Anarchy! Mayhem!

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.232
Rock 'n' roll, baby!

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.030
Come on, Joanie.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.532
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.035
Fuck you!

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:41.497
Rock 'n' roll.

01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:49.047
Fuck me.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:22.872
I think I just need a break...

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:25.583
from the band, or something.

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:32.423
If you haven't noticed,
we're in the middle of cutting a record.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.809
I just gotta spend time
with my family.

01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:47.772
Yourfamily?

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:50.817
Who?

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:55.738
No, really, your mom in lndonesia
or your drunk dad?

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.785
Are we not
yourfucked-up family now?

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.916
I can't do this anymore.

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:13.297
I need my life back, you know?

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.653
This is my life.

01:24:50.169 --> 01:24:52.295
The Runaways.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.884
The Runaways, they were a...

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:02.972
conceptual rock project that failed.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:09.145
Kim, do you have any regret
that the girls turned on you?

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.360
No.

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.946
I'm glad they turned on me.

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:22.992
It shows spirit.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.537
If I'm training a wild dog...

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:29.957
and it bites me in the hand...

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.668
then I know I've trained it well.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.256
My hand is made of iron.

01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:45.389
That's all it took.

01:25:46.433 --> 01:25:50.561
She's 16 years old
and she's already a creep.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:57.318
Am I worried about them?
No, they'll be fine.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:01.155
I mean, a yearfrom now, they'll all
be living in a trailer park in the Valley.

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:04.992
Fat, pregnant,
and happy as fleas on a dog.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.911
But me...

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.288
poor me...

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:13.584
I'm on my way to becoming...

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:18.214
rock 'n' roll legend.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:30.726
Put your finger there.

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.442
Yeah, something like that.

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:41.696
Cool.

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:45.950
I wish I could play.
I'd be in a band with you.

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:47.952
Yeah, but you can't.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:51.455
I heard Cherie's doing a movie.

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:53.291
Yeah?

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:55.459
You don't need her.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:59.046
You should go solo, like Bowie.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:04.176
Bowie'sjust Bowie.
He doesn't need any band.

01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:06.721
It was my band.

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:11.893
I wrote the songs,
she just sang them.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.146
Yeah, well,
people always remember the singer.

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.037
Get up.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:33.497
Hey, come on. Get up.

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:36.042
Everyone out. Hey.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:38.252
Come on, get up.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:42.673
Everyone, get the fuck out!
Come on!

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:45.801
- Hey! Come on!
- What?

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:47.553
Fuck off.

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:49.972
All right, all right.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.391
Yeah, fucking nice.

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:00.107
Stay. Stay right here.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.026
Just keep playing.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:03.694
I'll see you later.

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:55.538
I can't sell this to you.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:58.332
I have my ID.

01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:05.047
Calling manager to Counter 7.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.179
Yes, what can I do?

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:17.977
I'm sorry,
but we won't be able to sell you that.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:22.898
I'll have you fired...

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.942
replaced...

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:26.861
just like that.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.825
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave, please.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.077
Right now.

01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:42.501
You're nothing but dog shit, mister.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.628
And you...

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.800
you'rejust a filthy pussy.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.879
Pup 'n Fries.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:30.800
Hola, Pup 'n Fries. Can I help you?

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:33.094
Marie Currie, please.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.804
Cherie?

01:30:35.722 --> 01:30:37.431
What are you doing?

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:42.520
I need you to come and pick me up.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.688
I can't, I'm at work.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.565
I have to go.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:52.780
Places, everyone!

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:56.325
Places! Places!

01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:58.911
Places.

01:31:18.181 --> 01:31:20.391
Hey, you.

01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:23.644
You must obey...

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:28.732
or you will bleed.
You know I need to get my way.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.235
So now you listen up.

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:35.406
You are my pup.
I beat you up in every way.

01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:39.785
And when I speak to you,
you answer true.

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:42.413
I'll make you black and blue.

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:49.086
We are not to blame
for seeing love is pain.

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:55.843
We're not ashamed...

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:01.265
to say love is pain.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:05.728
To say that love is pain.

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:12.026
And I'll do it again!

01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:52.900
People have been asking about you
at Rodney's.

01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:58.197
Sorry for calling you at work.

01:32:58.365 --> 01:32:59.907
It's okay.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:04.411
How's it going over there?

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:05.996
Oh, it's a dream.

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:09.667
Especially when people come in
thinking I'm you.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:14.797
I actually signed an autograph
the other day.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:18.175
This guy came in
and asked for one for his daughter...

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:20.803
but I totally knew it was for him.

01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:27.434
Mom called.

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:33.023
She said they're playing "Cherry
Bomb" on the radio in Indonesia.

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.486
She tells everyone
you're her daughter.

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:41.699
I'm sure she tells them
she's my mother.

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:48.998
It's been a year.
You should at least talk to her.

01:33:55.171 --> 01:33:56.630
Yeah.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.710
Okay, that was Joan Jett
and the Blackhearts...

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:19.546
with "I Love Rock 'N Roll."

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.673
Now, Joan has surprised us...

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:24.301
by dropping by the station today.

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:25.636
Hi, Joan.

01:35:25.804 --> 01:35:28.013
How are you, Rodney?
It's good to see you.

01:35:28.181 --> 01:35:30.974
I was a big fan
in the English disco days.

01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:34.436
Oh, I remember
when you would come into the club...

01:35:34.604 --> 01:35:37.940
and you were only
about 15 years old.

01:35:38.108 --> 01:35:39.149
Yeah.

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:41.735
We used to play a lot
of the Runaways' music then.

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:44.947
The Runaways was my baby.

01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:47.324
We were so young back then too.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.159
Growing up on the road together.

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:51.161
- Hello, chop chop.
- When did you know...

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:54.289
that you wanted to be
a rock 'n' roll musician?

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:57.292
I think I always knew. I mean...

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.921
if it wasn't for rock 'n' roll,
I'd probably be dead or in jail.

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:03.048
It really saved my life.

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:08.554
- You grow up real fast on the road.
- You do. Real fast.

01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:11.765
Okay, well,
we're gonna take some calls now...

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:14.685
because we have
a lot offans waiting.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.232
Caller, you're on.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.360
Hi, Joan. It's Cherie.

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:26.155
Cherie?

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.201
How you doing?

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:33.871
I'm not dead or in jail.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:39.001
This is Cherie Currie,
former lead singer of the Runaways.

01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:40.294
How exciting.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:43.297
So, Cherie,
what have you been up to?

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:46.383
I'm kind oftrying to do
the acting thing.

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:50.220
Now, from what I understand,
it's been a while since you two spoke.

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:54.391
You guys must have
lots to talk about.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.568
Or maybe not on the air.

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:09.072
I just wanted to say hi.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.782
Yeah.

01:37:11.534 --> 01:37:13.785
Call yourfriends on your own time.

01:37:17.123 --> 01:37:18.916
Well, I gotta go, Joanie.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:21.710
Yeah, me too. I gotta run, Cherie.

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:27.132
Okay.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:30.052
Let's get back to the music.

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:35.265
This is another hit song from
the album, "Crimson and Clover."

01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:38.143
You're listening
to Rodney on the Rocks.
