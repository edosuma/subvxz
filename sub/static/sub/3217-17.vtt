36:00.241 --> 36:02.534
Is...? Is he right?

36:16.924 --> 36:19.342
I mean, we could lock you up at night...

36:19.510 --> 36:22.512
...but you'd bust out,
and some night you will...

36:23.306 --> 36:24.723
...someone else dies.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.854
I'm sorry, I am.

[SIGHS]

36:39.530 --> 36:42.616
So I guess that's all there is to it, then.

36:43.826 --> 36:47.245
-Stop it. Don't talk like that.
-Sam, I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.080
I don't wanna hurt you.

36:57.548 --> 36:58.590
Put that down.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.467
I can't do it myself.

37:03.930 --> 37:04.971
I need you to help me.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.181
Madison.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.766
-No.
-Sam.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.352
-I'm a monster.
SAM: You don't have to be.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.564
We can find a way, all right?

37:14.732 --> 37:17.901
-I can. I'm gonna save you.
-You tried.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.653
I know you tried.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.113
This is all there is left.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.325
Help me, Sam.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.161
I want you to do it.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.539
-I want it to be you.
-I can't.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.167
I don't wanna die.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.253
I don't.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.004
But I can't live like this.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.094
This is the way you can save me.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.681
Please.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.559
I'm asking you to save me.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.825
Sam.

38:57.626 --> 39:00.253
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're right.

39:01.630 --> 39:03.089
She's right.

39:04.925 --> 39:08.595
-Sammy, I got this one. I'll do it.
-She asked me to.

39:09.722 --> 39:12.766
-You don't have to.
-Yes, I do.

39:17.938 --> 39:18.980
Please.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.992
Just wait here.
