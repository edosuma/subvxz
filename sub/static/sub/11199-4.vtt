00:01.848 --> 00:03.941
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.017 --> 00:07.145
- I am Ba'al.
- As in boccie?

00:08.689 --> 00:11.453
<i>The city we've been looking for</i>
<i>is under the ice of Antarctica.</i>

00:11.525 --> 00:14.824
We came all this way just to find out
that we have to go all the way back.

00:17.164 --> 00:18.654
<i>Power source.</i>

00:19.433 --> 00:23.460
This Ancient weapon,
such an advanced piece of technology.

00:23.537 --> 00:26.062
The power requirements
must be enormous.

00:26.139 --> 00:27.902
I wish to request asylum.

00:27.974 --> 00:30.169
My fleet was destroyed
before I came here.

00:30.243 --> 00:34.145
Perhaps I could be
of some use to you here.

00:34.214 --> 00:36.478
General Hammond
is being promoted.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.415
Any idea who we're gonna
be stuck with?

00:38.485 --> 00:41.181
Brigadier GeneralJack O'Neill.

00:41.254 --> 00:43.848
I've spent my whole life
stickin' it to the man.

00:44.925 --> 00:46.950
I don't think I can be the man.

00:52.466 --> 00:54.024
Morning, sir.

00:54.101 --> 00:55.363
Walter.

00:55.435 --> 00:59.701
At 0730 this morning, SG-8 made
scheduled contact from P6J-908.

00:59.773 --> 01:03.470
They requested permission to bring an
alien life-form back for further study.

01:03.543 --> 01:05.636
Sir, it's just a plant.

01:05.712 --> 01:10.445
Your 0830 debriefing is <i>SG-2,</i> regarding
their recent mission to P8F-809.

01:10.517 --> 01:13.975
Folder's on your desk, along with the
personnel files you have yet to review.

01:14.988 --> 01:17.013
How many do I have left?

01:17.691 --> 01:19.682
All of them.

01:20.594 --> 01:22.084
Right.

01:23.163 --> 01:26.428
<i>Colonel Rudnell has asked me</i>
<i>to show you some bunting samples...</i>

01:26.500 --> 01:30.664
and Captain Corrigan's still awaiting
approval on the buffet menu.

01:31.338 --> 01:32.703
Bunting.

01:33.373 --> 01:35.568
- John.
- General.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.576
You are aware of the fact...

01:37.644 --> 01:40.977
that this is the most secure military
facility on the face of the planet.

01:41.047 --> 01:44.210
Actually, sir, there are still
a number of issues to be resolved.

01:44.284 --> 01:46.809
1000 hours, sir.

01:46.887 --> 01:48.218
Thank you.

01:58.231 --> 01:59.528
Sorry, sir.

01:59.599 --> 02:01.658
General O'Neill, Mark Gilmour.

02:01.735 --> 02:04.329
- He's your new administrative aide.
- General.

02:04.404 --> 02:06.133
- Did I order a new-
- No, sir.

02:06.206 --> 02:08.140
- Do I really need-
- Yes, sir.

02:08.809 --> 02:09.901
Civilian?

02:09.976 --> 02:13.309
I've been an analyst at the CIA
for the last eight years.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.747
Mostly background checks,
but I did have top-level clearance.

02:16.817 --> 02:19.513
He was assigned by
General Hammond. Yeah.

02:19.586 --> 02:21.554
In that case...

02:22.956 --> 02:24.355
welcome aboard.

02:28.728 --> 02:31.595
- How about if I give you a tour?
- Had one, sir.

02:31.665 --> 02:32.859
Dang.

02:32.933 --> 02:35.299
Very exciting to finally
see it all in action.

02:35.368 --> 02:37.859
General, your 0830.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.128
Yes.

02:41.775 --> 02:44.608
You're here to assist me, right?
How about you dive into those-

02:44.678 --> 02:49.513
Sir, sir. You really need to
read the file yourself.

02:49.583 --> 02:50.982
Yeah. Yeah.

02:51.651 --> 02:53.585
Thank you, Walter.

02:57.557 --> 02:59.548
- Does Mr. Gilmour have-
- Follow me.

03:05.632 --> 03:08.032
He's not like other generals.

03:08.101 --> 03:11.332
Actually, he's not
like other people.

03:12.472 --> 03:14.963
I take it I've got
some catching up to do.

03:15.041 --> 03:18.499
Yeah. And those are just the files
pertinent to today's agenda.

03:19.546 --> 03:21.480
I'd better get started.

03:22.482 --> 03:25.849
I can't tell you how happy
we all are to have you here.

03:26.753 --> 03:30.917
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Really, really happy.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.926
Thank you, Sergeant.

03:44.304 --> 03:46.295
I'm in position.

03:47.574 --> 03:50.907
No, sir.
He does not suspect a thing.

04:57.277 --> 04:59.211
Nothing in peridot?

04:59.279 --> 05:02.442
Traditionally, sir, this type of
event calls for red, white and blue.

05:03.183 --> 05:05.845
General Hammond is on the phone
from the Pentagon...

05:05.919 --> 05:08.683
and SG-1 is here
for the 1300 briefing.

05:08.755 --> 05:09.915
Thank you.

05:14.928 --> 05:18.489
Walter, I just don't have
the decorating gene. Would you mind?

05:18.565 --> 05:19.532
Yes, sir.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.235
Sir.

05:24.904 --> 05:26.838
General, how are you?

05:28.141 --> 05:32.100
I know, sir, but every time I open my
mouth to say George, "General" comes out.

05:51.731 --> 05:53.699
- Okay.
- General.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.701
Colonel. We've all met.

05:55.769 --> 05:57.862
Yes. Actually, we know
each other's life stories.

05:57.937 --> 06:00.201
- That snippiness?
- Is that a word?

06:01.274 --> 06:03.674
- What have you got?
- A gate address of a planet...

06:03.743 --> 06:06.303
formerly in Anubis domain
that Ba'al hasn't discovered yet.

06:06.379 --> 06:08.904
We believe it may be home
to an abandoned base.

06:08.982 --> 06:11.075
And just chock-full
of abandoned weapons?

06:11.151 --> 06:12.914
One can hope.

06:12.986 --> 06:16.012
This device was procured from Jaffa
formerly loyal to Anubis.

06:16.089 --> 06:18.080
It should allow us access
to the base.

06:21.194 --> 06:22.684
When's the next opening?

06:25.131 --> 06:27.292
- 0800 tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow?

06:28.101 --> 06:30.069
I got 14 teams out there.

06:31.137 --> 06:33.162
I'm sorry.
Operations protocol?

06:33.239 --> 06:34.934
Is it?

06:35.008 --> 06:37.272
The MALP showed no indication
of any Goa'uld activity.

06:37.343 --> 06:39.777
I still want SG-3
to cover your flanks.

06:39.846 --> 06:41.609
It's just recon.

06:41.681 --> 06:43.342
All the more reason
you can wait another day.

06:45.452 --> 06:46.942
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

06:48.021 --> 06:51.718
SG-5 and the representatives from Amra
to discuss the pending trade agreement.

06:53.493 --> 06:55.427
Love to stay and chat.

06:55.495 --> 06:59.556
If those rebelJaffa know about it, it's
only a matter of time before Ba'al knows.

06:59.632 --> 07:02.601
One day, Daniel. One day.

07:19.753 --> 07:22.313
Here comes one negotiation
I'm glad I'm not part of.

07:26.226 --> 07:28.626
It's a plant.

07:28.695 --> 07:29.957
Exactly.

07:30.029 --> 07:33.021
Twenty minutes ago it was a seed.

07:33.099 --> 07:35.465
Excuse me, sir,
if you don't mind my asking.

07:35.535 --> 07:39.631
Is it really wise to be bringing
alien life-forms through the gate?

07:42.008 --> 07:43.999
- It's a plant.
- Yeah.

07:44.077 --> 07:47.205
And besides, off-world teams
follow strict safety protocols...

07:47.280 --> 07:49.748
in determining
what to bring back to Earth.

07:49.816 --> 07:53.752
You know, if humankind is gonna benefit
from what we find out there...

07:53.820 --> 07:57.483
we have to be able to study it
in controlled situations.

07:58.558 --> 08:01.083
- It's a plant.
- I know.

08:01.161 --> 08:04.426
And I know our mandate is to
seek out new weapons and technology...

08:04.497 --> 08:06.556
to defend the planet
from our enemies...

08:06.633 --> 08:08.828
but wouldn't it be cool...

08:08.902 --> 08:12.338
if we could exploit the wonders of the
galaxy for other beneficial purposes...

08:13.473 --> 08:15.873
like curing disease...

08:16.543 --> 08:20.309
or in this case,
possibly solving world hunger?

08:22.315 --> 08:24.283
Speaking of which.

08:26.619 --> 08:28.553
Dr. Lee speaking.

08:30.456 --> 08:34.187
General! They want you
in the briefing room.

08:35.328 --> 08:38.354
- Hey. You wanna get some lunch?
- No, I'm fine.

08:39.032 --> 08:41.398
- You gonna sit in here all day and-
- I'm not sulking.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.594
Working.
Gonna say working.

08:44.337 --> 08:46.999
- O'Neill merely believes that-
- Guys, I'm fine.

08:47.073 --> 08:49.633
You can't really blame him
for wanting to send in backup.

08:49.709 --> 08:53.201
- I'm sure it has nothing to do with-
- I understand. He's just being cautious.

08:57.951 --> 08:59.179
Thanks, guys.

09:10.263 --> 09:13.755
General, if I might have a moment
with you. We're completely stalled.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.825
The Amrans can't agree
with each other, let alone us.

09:16.903 --> 09:18.871
They're like bickering children.

09:19.973 --> 09:21.964
Maybe they need a time-out.

09:24.277 --> 09:27.269
The Plains of Goran
are sacred ground!

09:27.347 --> 09:31.044
- To the Plainsmen.
- I am a Plainsman.

09:32.018 --> 09:33.246
I know.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.253
I take offense at that.

09:35.321 --> 09:37.414
A fence. Now there's an idea.

09:37.490 --> 09:40.186
- Howdy, folks.
- General, I think it would be best-

09:40.260 --> 09:42.455
What do you say we take
a little break?

09:42.528 --> 09:46.089
All this negotiating.
It's just exhausting.

09:46.165 --> 09:49.896
And you've been at it
a whole... hour already.

09:51.471 --> 09:53.666
We've prepared
special quarters for you.

09:53.740 --> 09:57.733
You can relax, get a massage,
room service-whatever you need.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.437
Come on. I'll show you.

10:06.185 --> 10:07.675
Fellas.

10:08.888 --> 10:10.913
What do you think?

10:13.192 --> 10:16.628
All right. So it's not the Ritz,
but we do what we can around here.

10:17.297 --> 10:19.822
Knock twice when you're ready
to talk like adults.

10:19.899 --> 10:22.459
- Wait, General.
- You don't expect us to share one room.

10:22.535 --> 10:25.436
Not amicably at first.

10:26.472 --> 10:28.463
But I have great hope
for you boys.

10:30.710 --> 10:33.702
- You can't do this.
- Open this door at once!

10:33.780 --> 10:35.771
Nobody gets out.

10:52.732 --> 10:55.633
<i>Dear General Hammond...</i>

10:55.702 --> 11:01.265
<i>Wish you were here</i>
<i>and that I was not.</i>

11:10.516 --> 11:13.485
Good morning, sir.
The delegates from Amra are furious.

11:13.553 --> 11:16.147
They're demanding to be released
and say there's no chance...

11:16.222 --> 11:19.419
a trade agreement will ever
happen between our governments.

11:19.492 --> 11:23.053
Did they try the doughnuts? You made
sure they were Krispy Kremes, right?

11:23.129 --> 11:26.963
- Shall I release them and send them home?
- Give 'em another day.

11:27.033 --> 11:28.625
- But, sir-
- No coffee?

11:28.701 --> 11:30.965
- Sorry. I can get-
- What's next?

11:32.905 --> 11:36.932
Dr. Lee needs to see you right away,
concerning the plant from P6J-908...

11:37.010 --> 11:39.979
SG-1 and 3 are in the gate room
preparing to embark...

11:40.046 --> 11:44.506
and it turns out that the red, white
and blue bunting is unavailable.

11:44.584 --> 11:46.176
No bunting?

11:46.252 --> 11:50.086
They can get some blue and white
and mix in some red.

11:53.559 --> 11:55.493
Just won't be the same.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.229
- Sir.
- Good morning, people.

12:05.905 --> 12:07.964
Sure wish I was
goin' with you...

12:08.041 --> 12:12.944
but I got a big day planned,
tasting menu items for the buffet.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.107
- Have fun, sir.
- You know I will.

12:16.983 --> 12:18.951
- Watch your back.
- I will.

12:19.619 --> 12:21.610
Mind the curfew.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.567
SG-3, hold here.

12:35.635 --> 12:37.034
Colonel.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.570
Colonel.

12:38.638 --> 12:40.697
Bosco and Peterson
can watch the gate.

12:41.507 --> 12:44.965
We're fine. Simple recon.
We'll stay in radio contact.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.442
Standard perimeter.

12:57.723 --> 13:01.124
The good news is
it hasn't eaten anybody yet.

13:01.194 --> 13:03.492
Thank you, Seymour.

13:03.563 --> 13:07.158
Yeah, obviously we underestimated
its growth properties.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.896
It seems to respond really dramatically
to any kind of visible light.

13:18.678 --> 13:22.444
I thought of that. I just thought
you might like to see it.

13:24.717 --> 13:26.810
Don't worry.
We'll get it under control.

13:28.888 --> 13:30.378
Sir-

13:44.904 --> 13:47.634
There are signs of recent
Jaffa activity in the area.

13:48.641 --> 13:50.836
Try the wrist device again.

13:50.910 --> 13:53.344
I have tried it several times.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.314
I'm getting some faint energy readings.

14:04.123 --> 14:06.887
SG-1 leader, this is SG-3 leader.
Come in.

14:10.463 --> 14:12.863
Peterson, you're with me.

14:13.933 --> 14:17.596
Bosco, if we don't make radio contact
in 10 minutes, dial Earth and report in.

14:18.571 --> 14:20.061
Take cover!

14:27.580 --> 14:29.571
Son of a bitch.

14:35.054 --> 14:38.080
Sir, Colonel Reynolds
has dialed in from P2X- 887.

14:38.157 --> 14:40.091
He's lost contact with SG-1.

14:40.159 --> 14:42.684
<i>One Al'kesh.</i>
<i>It buzzed the gate and flew off.</i>

14:42.762 --> 14:44.889
<i>No sign of the enemy</i>
<i>since then, sir.</i>

14:45.565 --> 14:49.331
<i>I've been unable to make radio contact</i>
<i>with SG-1 going on 19 minutes.</i>

14:49.402 --> 14:52.428
<i>Requesting backup and permission</i>
<i>to begin searching.</i>

14:52.505 --> 14:54.439
SG-10 and 1 <i>2.</i>

14:54.507 --> 14:56.805
Backup on the way.

14:56.876 --> 14:58.571
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

14:59.245 --> 15:02.237
<i>We have to close down</i>
<i>the entire level, seal it off.</i>

15:02.315 --> 15:04.340
Not only does it have
amazing growth properties...

15:04.417 --> 15:07.443
but it's proving extremely
difficult to eradicate.

15:13.593 --> 15:17.859
We think it's using the ventilation
shafts to spread airborne spores.

15:31.877 --> 15:33.936
We looked everywhere.
No sign of them.

15:34.013 --> 15:36.777
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You were there to watch their backs.

15:36.849 --> 15:38.180
Yes, sir.

15:38.851 --> 15:41.217
Colonel Carter insisted
we secure the gate.

15:41.287 --> 15:43.448
<i>Unauthorized incoming wormhole.</i>

15:46.993 --> 15:48.984
No I DC yet, sir.

15:55.468 --> 15:57.459
Stand down, boys.

15:59.138 --> 16:01.106
And what do you want?

16:02.174 --> 16:05.337
- I have your friends.
- And?

16:05.411 --> 16:07.276
I propose an exchange.

16:08.648 --> 16:10.912
- For what?
- Not what. Whom.

16:10.983 --> 16:12.450
Whatever.

16:12.518 --> 16:13.985
Camulus.

16:16.022 --> 16:18.957
- Who?
- I'll transmit a gate address.

16:20.059 --> 16:23.995
You will send him to me if you want to
see your friends alive again.

16:25.898 --> 16:27.627
Let me think about it.

16:29.168 --> 16:30.760
You have one day.

16:30.836 --> 16:36.172
Is that, like, one Earth day or-

16:45.685 --> 16:49.280
Nothing to report from the teams,
rebelJaffa, Tok'ra.

16:49.355 --> 16:52.119
No one seems to have
any intel on SG-1.

16:52.191 --> 16:55.820
As ordered, Camulus is being transferred
from the facility where he was being held.

16:55.895 --> 16:57.829
He should be here shortly.

17:00.466 --> 17:03.560
Even if we did comply and send Camulus
to the address Ba'al transmitted...

17:03.636 --> 17:06.127
we can't risk opening the iris here
to let SG-1 through.

17:06.205 --> 17:09.368
This could all be a trick
to get us to do just that.

17:09.442 --> 17:10.568
I know.

17:10.643 --> 17:13.339
Any exchange would have to involve
a Stargate on another planet.

17:13.412 --> 17:15.004
I made some suggestions.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.814
Are you really considering
turning Camulus over to Ba'al?

17:22.054 --> 17:23.544
It's on the table.

17:29.395 --> 17:31.158
He's here.

17:33.032 --> 17:35.000
Colonel, have your team ready.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.557
Yes, sir.

17:38.337 --> 17:40.498
Isn't it already too late?

17:43.175 --> 17:45.405
General O'Neill
was once captured by Ba'al.

17:47.213 --> 17:49.704
He was tortured, killed...

17:49.782 --> 17:51.773
and brought back to life
using a sarcophagus...

17:51.851 --> 17:53.785
more times than
you'd care to imagine.

17:55.588 --> 17:59.456
SG-1 never gave up then,
and General O'Neill won't now.

18:00.659 --> 18:03.150
There isn't a man or woman
on this base that would.

18:17.009 --> 18:19.375
Ba'al has three of my people...

18:19.445 --> 18:21.470
and he's offered up an exchange.

18:22.615 --> 18:24.810
- For me.
- Any idea why?

18:26.385 --> 18:29.912
- There are many possible reasons.
- Pick one.

18:32.992 --> 18:34.220
Nothin'?

18:35.361 --> 18:38.626
You offered to help us
if we granted you asylum.

18:39.298 --> 18:41.766
I did not expect to be
treated like a prisoner.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.927
You're a Goa'uld.

18:46.639 --> 18:48.266
What are you going to do?

18:48.340 --> 18:51.468
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't turn you over.

18:52.511 --> 18:54.445
Ba'al cannot be trusted.

18:55.514 --> 18:57.243
Yeah?

18:57.316 --> 19:00.012
No matter what you do,
he will never return your friends.

19:06.492 --> 19:09.586
- I thought you were just questioning him.
- He didn't have the right answers.

19:09.662 --> 19:12.688
General, this goes against official
policy regarding prisoner exchanges.

19:12.765 --> 19:16.633
He's not a prisoner.
He requested asylum. I'm ungranting it.

19:16.702 --> 19:21.002
- You could be court-martialed.
- If it gets my team back, I don't care.

19:21.073 --> 19:23.974
But you know it won't.
You're sacrificing him for nothing.

19:27.146 --> 19:28.636
Go, go.

19:41.427 --> 19:44.191
Let's take a walk, you and me.
Come on.

20:00.513 --> 20:02.504
I've done everything I can.

20:03.215 --> 20:06.480
It's up to you. Last chance.

20:07.987 --> 20:12.083
In spite of what you think,
I am not a coward.

20:15.194 --> 20:17.185
I think you are.

20:26.505 --> 20:28.632
It was worth a try.

20:30.175 --> 20:32.109
Take him back to his cell.

20:36.315 --> 20:38.306
It was a bluff?

20:46.258 --> 20:48.351
You could have told me, sir.

20:48.427 --> 20:51.089
How can I do my job
if you don't trust me?

20:51.163 --> 20:53.393
Not my problem.

20:53.465 --> 20:55.899
Wait, wait.
Camulus would like to talk to you.

21:00.773 --> 21:02.297
I cannot stay here.

21:02.374 --> 21:06.606
If Ba'al is truly so determined to have
revenge, he will not stop at this.

21:06.679 --> 21:08.613
It is not safe for you
to harbor me anymore.

21:08.681 --> 21:11.912
- So what?
- I am saying I am willing to leave.

21:11.984 --> 21:14.077
Out of the goodness
of your heart?

21:14.153 --> 21:16.087
Of course not.

21:17.690 --> 21:21.091
When I asked for asylum,
I did not expect to rot in a cell.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.789
Well, work with me. Give me something.
I'll see what I can do.

21:27.499 --> 21:31.663
I can tell you a planet where there is
a device created by the Ancients.

21:33.072 --> 21:35.131
- What's it do?
- I do not know.

21:35.207 --> 21:39.644
I never could discover its secrets.
Perhaps you can.

21:39.712 --> 21:41.976
You think this is what
Ba'al's really after?

21:43.282 --> 21:45.580
While I never disclosed
its location...

21:45.651 --> 21:48.814
I once made the mistake of
bragging that I found the device...

21:48.887 --> 21:50.878
at a meeting of the system lords.

21:52.424 --> 21:54.585
Hard to believe you bragging.

21:57.496 --> 21:59.623
<i>I knew it wasn't easy for you...</i>

22:00.699 --> 22:05.329
<i>but had I known...</i>
<i>what it was really like...</i>

22:06.005 --> 22:11.841
<i>I would have tried to be less</i>
<i>of a pain in the... ass.</i>

22:13.345 --> 22:16.212
<i>At least, I would have tried harder.</i>

22:16.281 --> 22:18.545
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

22:26.358 --> 22:28.588
Receiving SG-3's I DC, sir.

22:29.261 --> 22:31.252
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

22:44.076 --> 22:48.035
Just like you said, sir. Some sort of
Ancient device, the size of a large room.

22:48.113 --> 22:50.081
Any idea what it does?

22:50.149 --> 22:52.140
I'll leave that
up to the tech guys.

22:52.217 --> 22:56.210
But I can tell you this.
I know why he couldn't turn it on.

22:59.258 --> 23:01.920
- Wasn't plugged in.
- What is it?

23:02.995 --> 23:04.986
It's a ZPM.

23:05.764 --> 23:09.427
- What is that?
- A Zero Point Module.

23:09.501 --> 23:13.528
It's an Ancient power source
that draws its energy from subspace.

23:13.605 --> 23:16.096
It's the only thing powerful enough...

23:16.175 --> 23:19.042
to activate the Ancient defense weapons
SG-1 found in Antarctica.

23:19.111 --> 23:21.045
The one we have is pretty much dead.

23:21.113 --> 23:26.415
- Well, this one sure isn't.
- How good is it?

23:26.485 --> 23:28.885
I'm gonna have to do
some more detailed analysis...

23:28.954 --> 23:33.891
but these preliminary readings
indicate at least 50% capacity.

23:33.959 --> 23:36.519
That's good, isn't it?

23:41.233 --> 23:42.723
Excuse me.

23:43.702 --> 23:46.136
It's that damn plant.

23:49.108 --> 23:51.770
- Can we relocate?
- Where are those backup generators?

23:51.844 --> 23:53.778
Let's go to backup 3 21.

23:54.446 --> 23:56.471
We've lost power
to all control systems.

23:58.183 --> 23:59.377
Yes, sir.

24:01.386 --> 24:04.014
We paid the electric bill.
I checked.

24:04.089 --> 24:07.923
The plant is in the wall. It's interfering
with power and communication lines.

24:07.993 --> 24:09.824
There's no light in the walls.

24:09.895 --> 24:12.420
As long as any part of it
is exposed to light...

24:12.498 --> 24:15.262
it seems like it can
feed the unexposed areas.

24:15.334 --> 24:18.132
I'm recommending we keep the whole
base on minimal emergency lighting...

24:18.203 --> 24:20.569
until we get
the problem under control.

24:20.639 --> 24:21.901
How long?

24:22.975 --> 24:24.909
That's a little difficult to say...

24:24.977 --> 24:28.743
because first we have to figure out how
to get the problem under control.

24:40.125 --> 24:43.253
- Where are we?
- The dialing computer's off-line.

24:43.328 --> 24:45.353
There must be a circuit board
that got fried...

24:45.430 --> 24:47.421
when we tried to restore power
to the system.

24:47.499 --> 24:49.467
Incoming wormholes will connect...

24:49.535 --> 24:52.003
and we can still receive radio
communication and I DCs, but-

24:52.070 --> 24:54.538
- The iris?
- Manual control.

24:55.340 --> 24:58.468
What about dialing
the gate manually?

24:58.544 --> 25:00.478
That's a problem.

25:00.546 --> 25:02.707
The inner ring
seems to be locked in place.

25:02.781 --> 25:05.443
We tried disconnecting
the control interface, but-

25:05.517 --> 25:08.543
There was a gate diagnostic running
when the power went down.

25:08.620 --> 25:11.919
Could be something to do with the
commands being exchanged at the time.

25:12.891 --> 25:15.519
- Bottom line.
- We can't dial out.

25:18.964 --> 25:20.295
Okay.

25:44.089 --> 25:46.023
What? Oh, God.

25:46.091 --> 25:48.082
Sorry to wake you, sir.

25:52.364 --> 25:54.889
Feels like it's been 10 minutes.

25:55.734 --> 25:56.962
It has.

25:57.035 --> 26:00.766
There's an incoming wormhole.
Ba'al wants to talk.

26:02.407 --> 26:04.500
Ba'al, sorry to keep you waiting.

26:04.576 --> 26:06.510
Just taking a little nap.

26:06.578 --> 26:08.443
The deadline has passed.

26:08.513 --> 26:11.539
Look, we're having a little
technical difficulty here.

26:11.617 --> 26:14.051
Are your friends' lives
meaningless to you?

26:14.119 --> 26:16.849
Hey. This is not a stall tactic.

26:16.922 --> 26:19.948
I would have called you sooner,
but we can't dial out at the moment.

26:20.025 --> 26:21.185
Why not?

26:23.195 --> 26:26.426
I'm not really sure.
Here's some irony for you.

26:26.498 --> 26:30.264
Carter- have this thing
fixed like that.

26:33.739 --> 26:35.673
No offense there, Siler.

26:35.741 --> 26:37.868
- <i>None taken, sir.</i>
- Good.

26:39.177 --> 26:41.737
So, why don't you just
send her on through?

26:41.813 --> 26:45.214
Before you know it you'll have "Camel-ass"
back in your grubby little mitts.

26:45.284 --> 26:47.343
You dare mock me?

26:47.419 --> 26:50.616
Ba'al, come on.
You should know.

26:50.689 --> 26:52.623
Of course I dare mock you.

26:55.827 --> 26:58.091
You have one more day.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.791
Is it really wise to provoke him?

27:10.142 --> 27:12.133
It's what I do.

27:15.414 --> 27:17.814
Over two years ago,
the Tok'ra provided us...

27:17.883 --> 27:20.249
with the formula to the Goa'uld poison
they'd developed.

27:20.319 --> 27:23.413
We've been modifying it,
manufacturing as much as we can use...

27:23.488 --> 27:26.480
as a defensive option in the event of
another attack on Earth.

27:26.558 --> 27:30.289
Area 51 is confirming that there is
enough to negate a sizable enemy force.

27:30.362 --> 27:34.992
We think we can effectively neutralize
and invade three Goa'uld-occupied planets.

27:35.067 --> 27:36.967
The poison is nonpersistent...

27:37.035 --> 27:40.436
so there'd be limited time before
potential reinforcements become a factor.

27:40.505 --> 27:43.474
Determining which of Ba'al's planets
to target is still an educated guess.

27:43.542 --> 27:46.340
We're still gathering intel
on exactly where SG-1 's being held.

27:46.411 --> 27:51.474
This poison- does it killJaffa
as well as Goa'uld?

27:52.551 --> 27:53.813
That's right.

27:53.885 --> 27:56.012
How many casualties
are we talking about?

27:56.755 --> 27:57.983
Thousands.

27:58.056 --> 27:59.887
Tens of thousands.

27:59.958 --> 28:04.156
So it's not really a rescue plan.
It's a full-scale attack.

28:04.229 --> 28:07.528
That would certainly provoke a reaction-
possibly another attack on Earth.

28:07.599 --> 28:10.500
But considering the fact
that we now have a ZPM...

28:10.569 --> 28:12.696
to power the Ancient defenses,
I don't think-

28:12.771 --> 28:16.434
Sorry to interrupt, sir, but Camulus is
insisting that he speak with you again.

28:20.912 --> 28:23.904
Did you not find something of value
on the planet of which I spoke?

28:23.982 --> 28:27.474
- Oh, yeah. We did.
- Then why have you not released me?

28:28.987 --> 28:31.922
Or do you still believe
you can trade me for your friends?

28:33.492 --> 28:35.551
<i>Gamma radiation seems to work.</i>

28:35.627 --> 28:39.688
We're preparing a method of delivering
a strong enough level to the entire base.

28:39.765 --> 28:42.632
Now, nonessential personnel
are gonna have to be evacuated.

28:42.701 --> 28:45.226
Everyone else is gonna
have to wear protective suits.

28:45.303 --> 28:48.602
You have to get General O'Neill
to sign off on this right away.

28:48.673 --> 28:51.005
You know, he hasn't slept
in over two days.

28:51.076 --> 28:53.044
Yeah. That's why
I'm asking you to do it.

28:53.111 --> 28:54.601
Right.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.248
<i>I'm canceling the president's visit.</i>

28:58.617 --> 29:01.381
Really? Why would you do that?

29:01.453 --> 29:03.785
I'm surprised you can joke
at a time like this.

29:03.855 --> 29:06.255
It's pretty much
all I can do at the moment.

29:06.324 --> 29:09.885
Your flagship team is in the hands of
the enemy. You can't dial the Stargate.

29:09.961 --> 29:12.555
The base is overrun by an alien plant.

29:13.465 --> 29:15.399
We did find a ZPM.

29:16.068 --> 29:17.558
True.

29:19.404 --> 29:21.429
Give it another day.

29:21.506 --> 29:23.906
You think you can get
everything resolved by then?

29:24.576 --> 29:26.703
Wait a minute.

29:26.778 --> 29:29.076
I think there's a joke
in there somewhere.

29:31.883 --> 29:33.646
Got nothin'.

29:34.453 --> 29:38.514
<i>And so I regretfully submit</i>
<i>my resignation.</i>

29:38.590 --> 29:43.721
<i>And to be clear, the regret is</i>
<i>not so much about the resigning part...</i>

29:43.795 --> 29:45.922
<i>but the fact that</i>
<i>I was deluded enough...</i>

29:45.997 --> 29:48.795
<i>to think I had possessed</i>
<i>even one iota...</i>

29:48.867 --> 29:53.395
<i>of the ability needed to</i>
<i>fill your sizable and shiny shoes.</i>

29:58.743 --> 30:03.578
Dr. Lee just called. He feels confident
the plant has been fully eradicated.

30:03.648 --> 30:05.275
I wish I did.

30:05.350 --> 30:09.047
Oh, and the dialing computer
is back online.

30:20.465 --> 30:22.456
Chevron four encoded.

30:24.136 --> 30:26.127
You're releasing him?

30:26.872 --> 30:29.170
I made a deal.
We got a ZPM.

30:30.175 --> 30:33.076
Look, I know we can finally
dial Pegasus again...

30:33.145 --> 30:35.204
and still defend Earth
if we have to, but-

30:35.280 --> 30:37.214
Chevron five encoded.

30:42.454 --> 30:43.944
Control room.

30:44.923 --> 30:46.914
It's Dr. Lee.
He says it's important.

30:47.959 --> 30:49.449
Yeah.

30:51.463 --> 30:53.454
Abort the dialing procedure.

30:59.304 --> 31:02.501
Basically, it shouldn't be
glowing like this.

31:02.574 --> 31:05.338
- Why is it?
- It's funny really-

31:05.410 --> 31:07.935
- I like funny.
- This isn't the good kind of funny.

31:08.013 --> 31:11.642
I think it was the gamma radiation we used
to kill the plant that revealed this.

31:11.716 --> 31:14.184
- Revealed what?
- It illuminated a substance...

31:14.252 --> 31:17.915
foreign to what we know to be the
normal molecular makeup of a ZPM.

31:18.657 --> 31:19.749
And?

31:21.293 --> 31:24.456
We managed to scrape some
microscopic fragments from the casing...

31:24.529 --> 31:26.622
and run some tests and-

31:28.166 --> 31:29.827
You're gonna want these.

31:40.345 --> 31:43.940
This is what happens when you introduce
a constant electric charge.

31:55.327 --> 31:57.295
The ZPM is booby-trapped?

31:58.830 --> 32:00.889
We were gonna send it
to Antarctica.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.767
Can you imagine
if someone had taken it...

32:03.835 --> 32:06.303
and plugged it into the chair
in the Ancient outpost?

32:06.371 --> 32:09.898
I can't even imagine
the magnitude of the explosion.

32:10.976 --> 32:13.103
A charged ZPM detonating that-

32:14.279 --> 32:16.907
I don't know. It could have
destroyed the whole planet.

32:16.982 --> 32:19.542
That's why Camulus
was so eager to leave.

32:23.021 --> 32:25.080
Can you undo it?

32:27.592 --> 32:30.117
- We haven't actually-
- Yes or no?

32:37.736 --> 32:39.761
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:39.838 --> 32:42.568
When you couldn't figure out
what the Ancient device was for...

32:42.641 --> 32:45.007
you tampered with the power
source so nobody else could.

32:45.076 --> 32:47.010
I did nothing of the kind.

32:47.679 --> 32:49.169
Cammy.

32:51.316 --> 32:52.806
Worth a try.

32:54.052 --> 32:56.316
Here's the deal.

32:56.388 --> 32:58.583
How would you like
a chance to kill Ba'al?

33:00.425 --> 33:02.154
In exchange...

33:02.227 --> 33:05.754
you want me to use the Ancient device
to trade for the lives of your friends.

33:06.898 --> 33:08.160
Exactly.

33:09.367 --> 33:10.595
Amusing.

33:24.149 --> 33:25.639
All right?

33:26.551 --> 33:28.485
Coming with me?

33:28.553 --> 33:30.748
We're taking you to
another planet first.

33:30.822 --> 33:32.983
We'll wait for SG-1 there.

33:53.011 --> 33:54.979
<i>Receiving SG-3's IDC, sir.</i>

33:55.046 --> 33:56.536
Open it.

34:08.727 --> 34:12.219
- You're late.
- We thought we'd give it an extra hour.

34:13.264 --> 34:15.232
We knew it was a long shot.

34:18.269 --> 34:20.464
Thank you, Colonel. Dismissed.

34:35.220 --> 34:36.517
Sir.

34:36.588 --> 34:38.579
Colonel Reynolds
would like a moment.

34:39.324 --> 34:40.382
Fine.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.449
He's in the gate room, sir.

35:00.712 --> 35:02.236
What's goin' on?

35:02.313 --> 35:05.976
General, we just wanted you to know,
whatever you decide...

35:06.050 --> 35:07.984
we're behind you 100%.

35:08.953 --> 35:11.080
Just give the order,
and we're ready to go.

35:13.758 --> 35:15.692
I know you are, Colonel.

35:17.395 --> 35:18.623
Thank you.

35:28.072 --> 35:29.562
All of you.

35:35.380 --> 35:36.574
Dismissed.

36:16.221 --> 36:18.212
Good night, sir.

36:19.958 --> 36:21.949
Good night, Siler.

36:31.903 --> 36:34.371
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

36:39.043 --> 36:40.977
It's SG-1 's identification code.

36:41.045 --> 36:43.570
Sergeant O'Brien transmitted a hold
signal back through the gate...

36:43.648 --> 36:45.582
and is awaiting your instruction.

36:48.286 --> 36:50.254
- O'Brien.
- We have audio contact, sir.

36:50.321 --> 36:52.312
It's Colonel Carter.

36:55.126 --> 36:57.754
<i>We're under heavy fire, sir.</i>
<i>Open the iris.</i>

36:58.496 --> 36:59.520
Negative.

37:04.936 --> 37:06.767
Can you reroute?

37:06.838 --> 37:09.864
Negative.
The DHD is no longer accessible.

37:14.345 --> 37:16.370
Jack, what's goin' on?

37:16.447 --> 37:19.780
<i>You've been in enemy hands.</i>
<i>You know the protocol.</i>

37:19.851 --> 37:22.684
We have no way of knowing
if your iris code is secure.

37:22.754 --> 37:26.087
- What the hell are you talking about?
- <i>You were captured by Ba'al.</i>

37:26.157 --> 37:28.352
Ba'al? We're on P2X- 887.

37:28.426 --> 37:30.360
<i>We were trapped</i>
<i>in Anubis's secret base.</i>

37:30.428 --> 37:33.022
<i>When we came out we had a Jaffa</i>
<i>ambush waiting for us at the gate.</i>

37:36.034 --> 37:38.059
It appears theseJaffa
are loyal to Ba'al.

37:38.136 --> 37:40.798
The gate's gonna shut down.
We won't be able to dial out again.

37:45.610 --> 37:47.100
Open it.

37:50.715 --> 37:51.909
You're clear.

38:04.963 --> 38:06.453
Nice.

38:14.339 --> 38:15.567
Hey, guys.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.971
Thank you, sir.

38:17.041 --> 38:22.172
So, trapped in a secret base
all this time.

38:22.246 --> 38:23.577
Go figure.

38:23.648 --> 38:26.515
- The wrist device allowed us access.
- We couldn't get back out.

38:26.584 --> 38:29.052
- You thought Ba'al had captured us?
- That's what he said.

38:29.120 --> 38:32.817
- How did he even know we were missing?
- Reynolds saw an Al'kesh.

38:32.890 --> 38:35.290
Ba'al must have had his Jaffa
looking for the base.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.124
- Probably intercepted any radio chatter.
- That would explain the ambush.

38:38.196 --> 38:41.654
Ba'al's Jaffa couldn't find the base,
but they figured if we turned up-

38:41.733 --> 38:46.932
It's a great story. More importantly,
did Anubis leave anything cool behind?

38:49.173 --> 38:50.970
Not really. No.

38:52.577 --> 38:53.942
Nuts.

38:58.883 --> 39:00.475
Colonel Carter.

39:01.619 --> 39:04.179
- How are ya?
- I'm good. Thanks for asking.

39:04.255 --> 39:06.348
You're not gonna dress
for the occasion, sir?

39:07.792 --> 39:11.489
You know me. I love dressing up.
I was just on my way.

39:11.562 --> 39:12.927
Sir.

39:13.631 --> 39:17.692
- I wanted to talk to you-
- Carter, your evaluation is done.

39:17.769 --> 39:19.703
And I think you'd be very pleased.

39:20.438 --> 39:21.530
Really?

39:21.606 --> 39:23.574
You had doubts?

39:23.641 --> 39:25.700
Honestly, I was wondering...

39:25.777 --> 39:28.337
whether you were completely
confident in my leadership skills.

39:28.413 --> 39:29.846
Aren't you?

39:30.915 --> 39:34.544
I've been second-guessing myself for
ordering SG-3 to remain at the gate.

39:35.286 --> 39:37.379
Oh, pshaw.

39:37.455 --> 39:39.389
It was standard recon.

39:39.457 --> 39:42.449
Your tactics in dealing
with the ambush, perfect.

39:43.194 --> 39:46.527
You should read what Teal'c and Daniel
wrote about your conduct under fire.

39:46.597 --> 39:47.825
- Can I?
- No.

39:47.899 --> 39:49.867
- Damn.
- Teal'c said you were an animal.

39:50.568 --> 39:53.594
- He's such an exaggerator.
- Yeah. Isn't he?

39:56.140 --> 40:01.601
This is where I go to take off the clothes
I prefer and don the clothes I abhor.

40:03.181 --> 40:06.776
Sir. Quickly. I wanted to talk to you
about something else.

40:06.851 --> 40:09.376
I was reading Dr. Lee's report
about the tainted ZPM.

40:09.454 --> 40:13.151
I think he may have underestimated
the explosive potential.

40:13.224 --> 40:16.057
It could have actually destroyed
the entire solar system.

40:17.128 --> 40:19.062
What's the difference?

40:19.130 --> 40:22.622
My point is, if we figured it out,
so could Ba'al.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.794
- He could use it as a weapon against us.
- All true, Carter.

40:25.870 --> 40:29.704
Which is exactly why
I didn't give Camulus the tainted one.

40:30.641 --> 40:31.801
Sir?

40:31.876 --> 40:35.209
I gave him the dead one.
It's worthless, right?

40:37.115 --> 40:39.879
Ba'al's gonna be
pretty pissed at Camulus.

40:40.752 --> 40:41.946
Yeah.

40:55.333 --> 40:57.665
General, the president's motorcade
is through the gates.

40:57.735 --> 40:59.794
He should be getting on
the elevator momentarily.

41:03.441 --> 41:07.400
Sir, I think you should know
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

41:08.446 --> 41:09.936
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

41:10.014 --> 41:15.475
The truth is, I've been here on temporary
special assignment for the president.

41:19.357 --> 41:22.793
Sort of a civilian audit, if you will.

41:22.860 --> 41:24.521
Of the SGC?

41:25.797 --> 41:27.025
Of you.

41:39.977 --> 41:41.205
I know.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.513
- You do?
- General Hammond told me.

41:46.617 --> 41:49.711
- He wasn't supposed to.
- Well, don't tell anyone.

41:53.090 --> 41:56.218
Then you know the president wanted
to make sure you were settling in...

41:56.294 --> 41:58.421
before he came and shook your hand...

41:58.496 --> 42:01.021
and fully endorsed you
as the leader of this base.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.894
Obviously, he's here, so-

42:04.969 --> 42:08.461
What I mean is
I just want you to know...

42:08.539 --> 42:11.531
how much respect I have
for what you do here.

42:13.044 --> 42:14.807
And for you.

42:15.546 --> 42:16.570
Thanks.

42:20.184 --> 42:21.378
Shall we?

42:23.855 --> 42:28.690
By the way, did you let
those Amran delegates go?

42:28.759 --> 42:33.822
I did, sir. Major Davis said they seem
much more willing to negotiate now.

42:35.466 --> 42:37.866
You think they liked
the fruit basket?

42:37.935 --> 42:39.869
I think so, sir. Yes.

42:39.937 --> 42:42.269
I put a lot of thought
into that.
