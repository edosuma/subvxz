00:00.031 --> 00:01.197
<i>When you start a business,</i>

00:01.289 --> 00:02.914
<i>you sometimes forget
that you're on a budget.</i>

00:03.000 --> 00:05.242
<i>And you have to get rid
of frivolous expenses.</i>

00:05.336 --> 00:08.570
Who knew small-batch imported
marmalade could be so pricy?

00:08.656 --> 00:10.756
Yeah, I noticed that your
Spotify Premium membership

00:10.858 --> 00:11.857
just went up, too.

00:11.959 --> 00:14.193
Man, modern life is so expensive.

00:14.262 --> 00:17.096
How can I continue
to afford my jam <i> and</i> my jams?

00:17.198 --> 00:18.230
Shh!

00:18.299 --> 00:20.432
What's going on?

00:20.534 --> 00:21.633
- Why is...
- Dad.

00:22.703 --> 00:23.802
Is Rosalba asleep?

00:23.957 --> 00:25.289
She's been out for a good hour.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.324
How comforting.

00:26.392 --> 00:27.959
She looks so peaceful,

00:28.061 --> 00:29.861
like an adult Anne Geddes baby.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.229
Hey, is your homework done?

00:31.297 --> 00:33.164
I was gonna do it, but no one made me.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.833
Well, someone is making you now. Go.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.068
We better tuck her in.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.269
It's drafty.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.671
There you go, Rosalba.

00:40.773 --> 00:43.474
I like it when it's nice and tight.

00:43.542 --> 00:47.310
You know, I think I might have
a way we can save some money.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.779
Oh, I don't know, babe.
If we sell the couch,

00:48.848 --> 00:50.347
she's just gonna find
someplace else to sleep.

00:50.449 --> 00:52.282
I meant Rosalba.

00:52.351 --> 00:54.385
No! We can't let Rosalba go.

00:54.453 --> 00:56.587
She's a part of the family. I love her.

00:56.689 --> 00:57.988
Look, I don't want her to go.

00:58.056 --> 01:00.957
She's been babysitting since
Soraya was in diapers, but...

01:01.026 --> 01:02.793
you know, she used to
run around with the kids

01:02.895 --> 01:05.328
and read to them and...
and help them with projects.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.831
And now it seems like
all she does is nap

01:07.933 --> 01:10.100
and listen to Tony Robbins CDs
on her Discman.

01:10.168 --> 01:11.567
And, I mean, when was the last time

01:11.669 --> 01:12.835
she picked the kids up from school?

01:12.938 --> 01:14.337
Which is the reason why we kept her.

01:14.406 --> 01:17.374
Yeah. She told me only
the devil drives after 2:45.

01:23.882 --> 01:26.616
If we let Rosalba go,
who's gonna watch the kids?

01:26.718 --> 01:29.085
We can't just leave them alone
for two hours after school.

01:29.187 --> 01:30.453
What about Ben?

01:30.555 --> 01:33.056
You really think he's ready for
that level of responsibility?

01:33.158 --> 01:34.924
Where do we keep
the nine-volt batteries?

01:35.026 --> 01:36.091
I'm just doing my monthly sweep

01:36.193 --> 01:38.460
of the carbon-monoxide detectors.

01:38.562 --> 01:40.195
See? He doesn't even know
where the batteries are.

01:40.298 --> 01:43.032
Ben, if we were to let Rosalba go

01:43.134 --> 01:46.035
and pay you five bucks an hour
to watch Soraya after school,

01:46.137 --> 01:47.736
- would you...
- Yes, Mom! I can do this!

01:47.838 --> 01:50.940
And I'll use the money to open
a college savings account.

01:51.042 --> 01:53.175
No offense, Dad, but I took
a gander at your ledger,

01:53.277 --> 01:54.476
and it's not looking too good.

01:54.578 --> 01:55.877
Well, a lot of that money's in the hands

01:55.980 --> 01:59.748
of a certain Nigerian prince
who now owes <i> me</i> a favor.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.850
But as far as you babysitting
goes, I don't know.

02:01.952 --> 02:03.151
I can handle it, Dad.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.487
I've kept Gary the goldfish
alive for eight years.

02:05.589 --> 02:06.755
And it would save us money.

02:06.857 --> 02:09.223
I'd have to do some serious mulling.

02:09.326 --> 02:10.991
What if we did a babysitting dry run?

02:11.094 --> 02:12.093
Would that speed the mull?

02:12.195 --> 02:13.762
You can't speed the mull, Ben.

02:13.864 --> 02:15.897
It's a very delicate process, mulling.

02:15.999 --> 02:18.199
A dry run's not a bad idea, Al.

02:18.301 --> 02:19.967
But I was looking forward
to a good mull.

02:20.069 --> 02:21.602
Of course, I also love a good dry run.

02:21.704 --> 02:23.571
Which one do I love more?

02:23.673 --> 02:24.905
Hmm...

02:25.007 --> 02:25.940
Now I'm back to mulling.

02:26.041 --> 02:27.307
- Oh, Alex.
- Okay, fine.

02:27.409 --> 02:29.242
We'll do a dry run.

02:29.345 --> 02:31.479
- Or will we?
- I'm gonna kill you.

02:32.815 --> 02:34.114
Thank you for coming in, James.

02:34.216 --> 02:35.148
We'll definitely be in touch.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.550
And, hey, I know you weren't asking,

02:36.652 --> 02:38.485
but I'd love to come
to your improv show.

02:38.556 --> 02:41.588
- Great! Look forward to seeing you.
- Guys, I think we found

02:41.690 --> 02:42.989
our new administrative assistant.

02:43.091 --> 02:45.191
You've said that about every
single person we've interviewed.

02:45.293 --> 02:47.226
Because they're all so great
in their own unique way.

02:47.328 --> 02:48.528
It's like "The Bachelorette."

02:48.630 --> 02:50.262
I wish we could give them all a rose.

02:50.365 --> 02:51.664
We should probably do hometowns.

02:51.766 --> 02:53.432
That's your problem. You're too soft.

02:53.535 --> 02:55.067
This is a business decision.

02:55.169 --> 02:56.870
You got to take
the personal stuff out of it.

02:56.972 --> 02:58.371
Alex, you have to decide.

02:58.473 --> 03:00.707
We are drowning in admin
when we should be focusing

03:00.809 --> 03:02.641
on stuff like the meeting
with Nelson Munoz.

03:02.743 --> 03:04.110
Oh, right. That's this week.

03:04.212 --> 03:05.944
The guy with the radio thing.

03:06.047 --> 03:07.046
"The guy with the radio thing."

03:07.148 --> 03:08.814
Nelson Munoz is a broadcasting legend.

03:08.916 --> 03:11.150
If Nelson Munoz decides
to air us on his show,

03:11.252 --> 03:13.919
i-it would be like winning
the Powerball of podcasts.

03:14.023 --> 03:16.322
He single-handedly put "Who
Killed That Guy?" on the map.

03:16.424 --> 03:17.556
I love "Who Killed That Guy?"

03:17.658 --> 03:18.790
Who <i> did</i> kill that guy?

03:18.893 --> 03:20.726
We never learn.
That's what's great about it.

03:20.828 --> 03:23.229
All the more reason to buckle
down and pick an assistant.

03:23.331 --> 03:24.329
Okay, I got it.

03:24.431 --> 03:25.998
I'm just gonna take
all these résumés home

03:26.099 --> 03:27.457
and make a decision tonight.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.054
I'm C.E.O. of this company,

03:29.155 --> 03:30.589
and I can make tough choices.

03:30.691 --> 03:33.992
I'm not gonna be swayed by
the fact that Phil from UPenn

03:34.094 --> 03:37.062
has to live with
red-green color blindness.

03:37.163 --> 03:39.330
Think about Christmas time for Phil.

03:39.432 --> 03:41.933
No. I don't care.

03:42.035 --> 03:44.002
Screw him! Sucks for you, Phil.

03:45.271 --> 03:47.271
- Where's the fire extinguisher?
- Under the sink.

03:47.373 --> 03:48.473
Where's the other fire extinguisher?

03:48.575 --> 03:50.141
Coat closet, next to the broken vacuum.

03:50.243 --> 03:52.176
Okay. The phone rings. Brrring, brrring!

03:52.278 --> 03:53.811
Hey, Ben. It's me, Emily.

03:53.913 --> 03:55.146
- You wanna chat?"
- "Sorry, Emily.

03:55.248 --> 03:57.348
I can't talk right now, but I'll
see you at school tomorrow."

03:57.450 --> 03:59.049
"Oh, but, Ben, I'm so lonely."

03:59.152 --> 04:01.018
- Alex!
- Okay. Final question.

04:01.121 --> 04:03.187
You get home from school,
you're making a snack...

04:03.289 --> 04:06.023
ants on a log, grapes,
that weird bag of juice.

04:06.126 --> 04:08.426
A picture of domestic
after-school bliss...

04:08.528 --> 04:11.462
when, suddenly,
Soraya chokes on a grape.

04:13.198 --> 04:14.331
How do you do the Heimlich maneuver?

04:14.433 --> 04:15.766
First, I wrap my arms around her.

04:15.868 --> 04:17.300
All right, take it down
a notch, Meryl Streep.

04:17.402 --> 04:19.369
- Sorry.
- Then with the thumb side of my fist,

04:19.471 --> 04:21.471
I press against her abdomen,
below her ribcage,

04:21.572 --> 04:22.673
and above her navel,

04:22.775 --> 04:25.408
and exert pressure
until the grape is expelled.

04:25.511 --> 04:27.544
Wow. Is that right?

04:27.613 --> 04:28.846
What do I know? I'm not a paramedic.

04:28.914 --> 04:30.447
Oh, come on. He was incredible!

04:30.516 --> 04:32.850
Okay, get out of here
while we discuss your fate.

04:32.918 --> 04:35.452
So? Are you convinced?

04:35.554 --> 04:38.221
I'm actually thinking Soraya's
safer with Ben than with us.

04:38.290 --> 04:39.623
Now all that's left to do

04:39.691 --> 04:41.791
is fire a beloved member of our family.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.260
I'll handle it. Don't worry.

04:43.328 --> 04:44.561
No, no, no. I'll do it.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.129
You'll do it? Okay.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.631
Why does everyone think
I can't be a hard ass?

04:47.699 --> 04:49.666
I mean, first Eddie and Deirdre
with this hiring thing,

04:49.768 --> 04:51.768
- and now you.
- Ben thinks that he's been taking care

04:51.870 --> 04:53.170
of the same goldfish for years

04:53.238 --> 04:55.539
because you couldn't tell him
that the first Gary died,

04:55.607 --> 04:57.739
so you've been buying him
replacement Garys.

04:57.841 --> 04:59.074
Gary 15 was my favorite.

04:59.143 --> 05:00.942
Sure, I don't like giving bad news,

05:01.045 --> 05:02.478
but I'm not incapable of it.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.480
I'm a C.E.O. now,
and that's part of the job.

05:04.549 --> 05:07.183
Love this new attitude.
Totally not buying it.

05:07.285 --> 05:09.185
Look, I may have
a reputation for being soft,

05:09.287 --> 05:10.352
but I can get hard.

05:10.454 --> 05:11.987
Very hard.

05:12.056 --> 05:15.524
Now, poor Rosalba's about
to see just how hard I can get.

05:15.593 --> 05:16.525
What?

05:16.627 --> 05:18.294
You really don't hear it?

05:18.362 --> 05:20.028
You're a C.E.O. You're a C.E.O.

05:20.097 --> 05:22.963
Yes, you are a C.E.O.,
and you are the best C.E.O.

05:23.066 --> 05:24.765
Oh, thank you, Rosalba.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.967
But, actually, can I talk
to you for one second?

05:27.036 --> 05:28.869
Of course, Mr. Schuman. I'm here.

05:28.938 --> 05:31.772
- ¿Qué pasa?
- Um...

05:31.874 --> 05:33.908
You are... You're great.

05:34.010 --> 05:35.210
You are so great.

05:35.278 --> 05:36.877
I mean, our whole family
loves you so much.

05:36.979 --> 05:38.213
"Te Amos" all around.

05:38.315 --> 05:39.380
Yo también Te quiero.

05:39.449 --> 05:41.782
But as much as we "Te amo" you...

05:41.851 --> 05:44.051
like, you know, the kids
are... are growing up,

05:44.120 --> 05:45.820
and... and I started this new company.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.655
And ever since then,
money is very pequano.

05:48.757 --> 05:50.324
- Pequeño.
- Exactly.

05:50.426 --> 05:53.260
Also, at my other trabajo,
we're hiring a new assistant,

05:53.362 --> 05:55.295
and that's more money, so...

05:55.364 --> 05:56.663
change is in the air, you know.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.799
And I don't want you to think
of this as an ending,

05:59.901 --> 06:02.168
but actually
as a new beginning, you know?

06:02.238 --> 06:03.637
To new beginnings. Right?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.739
Nuevos...

06:05.841 --> 06:06.873
rancheros.

06:06.975 --> 06:07.907
All right?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.008
Do you understand what I'm saying?

06:09.111 --> 06:10.877
Yes, I understand, Mr. Schuman.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.178
Okay. Thank you.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.381
Feliz Navidad, okay?

06:14.450 --> 06:15.782
Feliz Navidad.

06:15.884 --> 06:17.416
Okay.

06:17.518 --> 06:18.885
Do you want to say goodbye to the kids?

06:18.987 --> 06:19.853
No, I'm good.

06:21.757 --> 06:22.856
Pretty hard.

06:22.958 --> 06:25.491
Told ya.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.060
Good morning, guys!

06:27.162 --> 06:29.195
Notice anything different about me?

06:30.698 --> 06:32.232
- You plucked your eyebrows.
- Yeah, eyebrows!

06:32.333 --> 06:33.967
Deirdre, get your head in the game.

06:34.069 --> 06:36.268
No. Even though
it was very difficult for me,

06:36.370 --> 06:39.671
last night, I fired our family's
beloved babysitter, Rosalba.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.874
Look at you. Big, bad Al.

06:41.976 --> 06:44.021
So, did you also happen
to pick an assistant?

06:44.107 --> 06:45.942
I did not. But now that I've shown

06:46.012 --> 06:48.012
I can make very difficult choices,

06:48.082 --> 06:51.817
I'm prepared to hire someone
who is sharp and driven and...

06:51.919 --> 06:52.951
Rosalba?!

06:53.053 --> 06:54.253
Buenos días.

06:54.354 --> 06:55.287
Here I am, Mr. Schuman.

06:55.389 --> 06:58.156
You hire me to work. And I am here.

06:58.258 --> 07:01.025
The new eyebrows
really capture your surprise.

07:03.232 --> 07:05.294
- I'm Rosalba. I work at Ahana.
- Hi.

07:05.357 --> 07:07.046
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay, wait.

07:07.092 --> 07:10.300
So, you tried to fire
your kids' babysitter, but...

07:10.362 --> 07:12.062
Now she thinks she works at Ajana.

07:12.113 --> 07:13.379
Hi. I'm Rosalba.

07:13.448 --> 07:14.847
- I work at Ahana.
- Hi.

07:14.915 --> 07:15.881
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.370
Yep, I believe that's what we're seeing.

07:17.401 --> 07:20.276
But you know what? Maybe there's
some lemonade to be made here.

07:20.362 --> 07:22.906
Maybe Rosalba is the assistant
we've been looking for.

07:22.977 --> 07:25.745
Alex, I hate to disagree with you.

07:25.814 --> 07:28.612
I hate it enough to make two fists.

07:28.690 --> 07:30.723
But we have a ton
of actually qualified candidates

07:30.792 --> 07:32.492
- for this job.
- Shame on you, Deirdre.

07:32.561 --> 07:34.360
Just because Rosalba doesn't
have the latest pantsuit

07:34.429 --> 07:37.463
from Paris or Milan or Burlington...

07:37.565 --> 07:38.864
Coat Factory

07:38.933 --> 07:41.334
doesn't mean she wouldn't make
a perfectly excellent employee.

07:41.402 --> 07:42.668
Oh, really?

07:42.736 --> 07:44.503
Is that why you fired her
from babysitting your kids?

07:44.605 --> 07:45.838
Well, she'd outgrown that, Eddie.

07:45.940 --> 07:47.173
She needed a new challenge.

07:47.275 --> 07:48.807
And what could be more challenging

07:48.876 --> 07:50.977
than working for a company
she knows nothing about,

07:51.045 --> 07:53.379
conducted in a language
she barely speaks,

07:53.448 --> 07:55.614
using a technology that
frightens her terribly?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.450
Oh, look.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.584
That's Rooni.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.285
I can't wait to tell her
about this wonderful,

08:00.354 --> 08:01.887
out-of-the-box idea I just had.

08:01.956 --> 08:03.755
Hey, hon!

08:03.858 --> 08:05.357
Hey. What's going on?

08:05.425 --> 08:08.126
Oh, nothing worth mentioning.

08:08.195 --> 08:09.561
<i>Can I tell you something crazy?</i>

08:09.630 --> 08:10.996
I'm more nervous than I thought I'd be

08:11.064 --> 08:12.097
about leaving the kids at home.

08:12.165 --> 08:13.231
Oh, come on. They'll be fine.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.633
Ben's a born Heimlich'er.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.167
Well, I guess it doesn't help

08:16.203 --> 08:18.136
that I just found out
I have to go to Rikers Island.

08:18.205 --> 08:19.771
Is this your one phone call?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.005
You know you make that joke

08:21.073 --> 08:22.840
every time I say I'm going to a prison?

08:22.899 --> 08:23.808
Yeah.

08:23.877 --> 08:24.876
Whoa!

08:26.880 --> 08:28.145
- I'm flying!
- You know what, babe?

08:28.214 --> 08:29.647
I should probably get going.

08:29.716 --> 08:31.348
Listen, can you just make
sure you get home by 6:00?

08:31.417 --> 08:32.517
It would make me feel a lot better.

08:32.619 --> 08:33.851
Okay. I'll be home by 6:00.

08:33.953 --> 08:36.988
- <i>Bye! Love you!</i>
- Oh.

08:37.089 --> 08:39.924
Rooni thought my out-of-the-box
decision to hire Rosalba

08:40.025 --> 08:42.192
put the "Oh!" in C.E.O.

08:42.260 --> 08:46.363
Yeah. Rosalba seems to really
be taking to office life.

08:46.432 --> 08:47.297
Lunes...

08:47.400 --> 08:49.533
Am I right?

08:49.635 --> 08:51.768
She's not wrong.

08:51.837 --> 08:54.671
I can't believe this is happening!

08:54.773 --> 08:56.507
Me neither. It's gonna be epic.

08:56.575 --> 08:58.575
It's gonna be epic, all right.

08:58.677 --> 09:01.345
Okay. First off, a healthy snack.

09:01.414 --> 09:04.080
Then 10 to 15 minutes of rest
for proper digestion,

09:04.149 --> 09:06.049
and then, of course, homework.

09:06.117 --> 09:09.419
Or I eat this cherry Popsicle
and you do whatever you want,

09:09.487 --> 09:10.819
because no one's in charge right now.

09:10.888 --> 09:12.688
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:12.757 --> 09:15.458
<i>I'm</i> in charge right now,

09:15.527 --> 09:18.161
and Popsicles are not on the agenda.

09:18.229 --> 09:19.662
Mom and Dad are trusting me,

09:19.764 --> 09:22.098
and I'm not about to squander
this opportunity.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.799
How am I related to a mathlete?

09:23.901 --> 09:26.000
Hey! I may be known for my mathleticism,

09:26.070 --> 09:27.936
but that doesn't mean I'm not fun.

09:28.004 --> 09:30.138
If you finish your homework,
I'll let you watch

09:30.207 --> 09:32.240
that Ken Burns documentary
on the Roosevelts.

09:32.342 --> 09:33.641
Yeah, I'm out.

09:33.743 --> 09:35.143
But you love Ken Burns!

09:38.048 --> 09:39.914
What do you mean, "out"?

09:40.016 --> 09:41.983
I mean I'm not doing your dumb agenda.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.820
"Death Feast 9"?!

09:45.889 --> 09:46.988
But that's a horror movie!

09:47.090 --> 09:48.021
Yep.

09:48.091 --> 09:49.790
Soraya, if you buy that,

09:49.892 --> 09:52.293
I'm gonna have to tell Mom
that you were out of control.

09:52.395 --> 09:54.528
Yeah? But if you do that,

09:54.630 --> 09:56.430
what you're really telling Mom

09:56.499 --> 09:58.665
is that you couldn't handle this job.

09:58.767 --> 10:02.636
And you can say goodbye
to all that babysitting money.

10:02.705 --> 10:05.806
I'm gonna press this button,
and you're gonna walk away.

10:10.279 --> 10:12.550
That's what I thought.

10:14.049 --> 10:16.620
Okay. So, this is my e-mail inbox, okay?

10:16.683 --> 10:17.684
You see this e-mail...

10:17.720 --> 10:19.552
<i>Getting Rosalba up to speed
wasn't gonna be easy.</i>

10:19.622 --> 10:20.787
<i>But I didn't want Eddie and Deirdre</i>

10:20.856 --> 10:22.288
<i>to think I'd made a mistake
by hiring her.</i>

10:22.357 --> 10:23.556
Okay? Do me a favor. You try it.

10:23.659 --> 10:25.391
Drag this whole thing over to the trash.

10:27.195 --> 10:28.662
Okay, you know what?

10:28.731 --> 10:30.363
That's on me. Bit of a language barrier.

10:30.465 --> 10:33.767
Rosalba, I need you to take some...

10:33.836 --> 10:35.368
iniciativo.

10:35.470 --> 10:37.069
- Iniciativa.
- Iniciativa.

10:37.139 --> 10:38.171
You got it. Let's get on that.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.539
- Alex?
- Yeah?

10:39.608 --> 10:41.307
Can we talk to you in the
conference room for a minute?

10:41.376 --> 10:42.542
Yes. Of course. Rosalba...

10:42.644 --> 10:44.344
- inciativa!
- Iniciativa!

10:44.412 --> 10:45.945
You got this. Whoo-hoo.

10:47.782 --> 10:50.416
Al, Rosalba has got to go.

10:50.485 --> 10:51.884
She has no idea what she's doing.

10:51.986 --> 10:53.653
She ordered 1,000 ink cartridges

10:53.755 --> 10:55.087
for a printer that we do not have.

10:55.189 --> 10:57.623
She sent a blank e-mail
to all of our contacts.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.591
She's like an elderly Amelia Bedelia.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.360
We asked her to order lunch.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.529
She got one Italian sub...

11:03.597 --> 11:05.364
- for herself.
- All right, look, you guys.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.166
I know Rosalba has made some mistakes.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.467
Who amongst us hasn't?

11:08.536 --> 11:10.902
But I know in my heart
that she's good at something.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.172
Oh, God. She's got tools.

11:13.274 --> 11:14.339
Wha...

11:15.909 --> 11:17.508
See? Look at that!

11:17.577 --> 11:20.879
She's taking some initiative.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.647
She's putting together that IKEA desk

11:22.749 --> 11:24.215
we've been meaning to build for months!

11:24.284 --> 11:26.117
Yeah, that desk is called Skarsnorp.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.418
I know, 'cause I have it in medium.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.353
Oh.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.189
And see? You were wrong!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.091
She ordered lunch for everybody.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.995
Oh, wait, no.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.030
That appears to be another sub
just for Rosalba.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.036
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.905
Random cavity searches.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.274
They did not go deep enough.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.276
No problem.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.012
Mr. Felix, we are gonna do
our best to get you out of...

11:55.081 --> 11:57.615
- Wow, that is a lot of meth.
- Oh, you think that's a lot?

11:57.684 --> 12:00.084
You should see the shed behind my house.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.320
Wait. We have
a no-tattling thing, right?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.221
Uh-huh. Yeah.

12:06.558 --> 12:07.490
Damn it.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.726
What? Something about my parole?

12:09.794 --> 12:12.362
Nope. Not that.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.497
We left the kids at home alone
for the first time today,

12:14.566 --> 12:15.732
and my phone died.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.667
You know, my parents
left me alone all the time.

12:17.769 --> 12:19.102
I think I turned out pretty okay.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.870
Hey, can you Google how to make a shiv?

12:20.939 --> 12:23.005
I'm new here.
I got a lot of meth to protect.

12:23.074 --> 12:25.575
You know what? I'm just
gonna make a quick phone call.

12:25.644 --> 12:26.710
Okay.

12:30.047 --> 12:31.179
Oh, man!

12:31.249 --> 12:34.583
That zombie's gonna tear her arms off!

12:34.685 --> 12:36.719
Popsicle, please.

12:36.820 --> 12:39.121
Now, you promised if I brought
you one more Popsicle,

12:39.223 --> 12:40.289
you'd turn it off.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.090
I lied.

12:43.193 --> 12:44.627
Why would they eat a face?

12:44.729 --> 12:46.194
They're zombies. They love face.

12:48.299 --> 12:50.031
It's just the phone, scaredy-cat.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.034
Remember, we only take calls
from Mom or Dad.

12:53.103 --> 12:54.502
Who's Rikers Island?

12:54.571 --> 12:55.670
Don't answer that!

12:58.976 --> 12:59.941
Anything?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.209
Oh, I'm sure you're overreacting.

13:01.278 --> 13:02.811
What are they, 15? 16?

13:02.913 --> 13:04.512
- 12 and 8.
- Gah!

13:04.581 --> 13:05.613
What's wrong with you?

13:05.715 --> 13:07.048
<i>You</i> should be in this jumpsuit.

13:07.151 --> 13:09.350
Thanks, Dave.

13:09.452 --> 13:10.685
And you wanted to fire her.

13:10.788 --> 13:12.187
Look at all this productivity!

13:12.256 --> 13:13.989
The Swedes make it very easy.

13:14.057 --> 13:16.758
Plus, their little meatballs
ain't bad either.

13:16.826 --> 13:17.892
You are supposed to cook those.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.762
Nah, I just let 'em defrost in my mouth.

13:20.863 --> 13:23.097
Great news. Mr. Munoz is here.

13:23.199 --> 13:24.699
- What?
- What? Why is he here?

13:24.801 --> 13:26.167
He's not supposed to be here
till tomorrow.

13:26.235 --> 13:27.902
Because he call and he ask

13:28.004 --> 13:30.137
if he could come today
instead of tomorrow.

13:30.206 --> 13:31.439
And I say okay.

13:31.508 --> 13:32.640
Iniciativa.

13:32.742 --> 13:34.575
Ohh. Bad iniciativo.

13:34.678 --> 13:36.743
This is a nightmare.
We are completely unprepared.

13:36.846 --> 13:38.612
We don't have any food.
The conference room is booked.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.281
And I'm not wearing a poplin ruffle top

13:40.349 --> 13:42.116
- with a high-waisted pant!
- What if we cancel?

13:42.185 --> 13:43.984
We can't cancel. He's already here.

13:44.086 --> 13:46.053
- Do you want me to tell him to go?
- No, no, no, no.

13:46.122 --> 13:47.288
Rosalba, don't... don't tell anyone

13:47.389 --> 13:49.156
to go or come or anything, okay?

13:49.225 --> 13:51.058
Could you please just do me
a favor and get him some water?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.893
Hot or cold?

13:52.995 --> 13:54.028
Not hot.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.229
So cold.

13:55.331 --> 13:57.163
Yep.

14:00.068 --> 14:02.001
Okay. Let's go talk to him.

14:03.839 --> 14:05.205
Oh, my goodness!

14:05.273 --> 14:08.641
Mr. Munoz, may I say you put
the "body" in Peabody Award?

14:08.710 --> 14:09.809
- I probably shouldn't.
- Okay.

14:09.878 --> 14:11.211
Deirdre, why don't you go
to the conference room

14:11.279 --> 14:13.313
- and collect yourself?
- Okay. Okay.

14:13.414 --> 14:16.015
Big fan! Listen to your stuff
all the time.

14:16.117 --> 14:18.851
Oh, really? Which "stuff," exactly?

14:18.919 --> 14:21.854
The one where the people
try to do that thing,

14:21.922 --> 14:24.790
but then, they don't do... that thing.

14:24.892 --> 14:26.492
Mr. Munoz, I'm Alex Schuman.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.126
I think Eddie's referring
to that segment you did

14:28.229 --> 14:29.729
where you and your father went to Rome.

14:29.797 --> 14:31.897
I have to know... Did your
father ever find those boots?

14:31.966 --> 14:34.199
Wow. How do you remember that?

14:34.301 --> 14:36.134
That... That was like eight years ago.

14:36.237 --> 14:37.336
He did this amazing piece

14:37.405 --> 14:39.104
where him and his father
traveled around Italy.

14:39.173 --> 14:40.839
Yeah, but nobody ever talks
about the boots.

14:40.908 --> 14:42.007
Everyone wants to know

14:42.109 --> 14:44.009
how I could've possibly
lost my passport.

14:44.111 --> 14:45.543
Well, you know what?
I could hear in your voice

14:45.645 --> 14:47.279
just how important
those boots were to him.

14:47.381 --> 14:50.682
Well, he got them.

14:50.784 --> 14:52.284
- Thanks for asking.
- Sure.

14:52.353 --> 14:53.919
You know, why don't
we go over to our little area?

14:53.988 --> 14:56.134
- Yeah.
- You caught us a little off-guard today...

14:56.204 --> 14:57.655
but I'm glad you're here.

14:57.758 --> 14:59.624
I was hoping you and I
could share some stories,

14:59.693 --> 15:00.792
and you can get a little sense

15:00.895 --> 15:02.394
of what it is we're trying to do here.

15:02.496 --> 15:03.794
That sounds great.

15:03.897 --> 15:05.829
You know, there's a little
follow-up to that boot story.

15:05.932 --> 15:07.164
- Oh?
- I remem...

15:07.267 --> 15:08.732
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

15:08.834 --> 15:10.050
- I'm so sorry!
- The Skarsnorp!

15:10.144 --> 15:11.187
What the hell happened?

15:11.242 --> 15:12.527
_

15:13.425 --> 15:15.238
_

15:15.300 --> 15:17.730
_

15:17.754 --> 15:18.643
_

15:18.644 --> 15:19.777
Rosalba.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.478
Lunes...

15:21.580 --> 15:22.880
Am I right?

15:26.375 --> 15:27.975
That couldn't have gone worse.

15:28.044 --> 15:29.376
That's what I thought,
until Deirdre offered

15:29.445 --> 15:30.578
to give him mouth-to-mouth.

15:30.646 --> 15:32.112
It was crazy how she carried him out.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.072
It was like a mother
lifting a van off a baby.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.048
This is all my fault.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.940
If only I'd fired Rosalba,
none of this would've happened.

15:37.010 --> 15:38.424
Yep. Pretty much.

15:38.526 --> 15:39.858
I can't do it, man. Okay?

15:39.960 --> 15:41.160
You were right... I'm too soft.

15:41.229 --> 15:42.894
I'm like a frickin' Care Bear.

15:42.963 --> 15:46.165
I actually think a Care Bear
would be an excellent C.E.O.

15:46.234 --> 15:47.533
And I think you will be, too,

15:47.602 --> 15:49.335
because you do care
so much about people.

15:49.403 --> 15:51.303
It's like with that Munoz guy...

15:51.372 --> 15:53.538
He was headed out the door
until you reeled him back in

15:53.607 --> 15:55.373
by caring about his dad's dumb boots.

15:55.442 --> 15:56.807
I connected to his story.

15:56.876 --> 15:58.309
I don't know how that
helps me run my business.

15:58.378 --> 16:00.378
Because a company
is just a bunch of people.

16:00.447 --> 16:02.113
People you're gonna care about too much.

16:02.215 --> 16:03.414
And the bigger this company gets,

16:03.483 --> 16:05.450
the more people
there's gonna be to care about.

16:05.519 --> 16:07.885
The only catch is,
every once in a while,

16:07.954 --> 16:09.687
if an old lady's hurting your business,

16:09.756 --> 16:11.189
taking care of the rest of the people

16:11.258 --> 16:14.058
might mean kicking
that old lady to the curb.

16:14.127 --> 16:16.361
But the good news is,

16:16.429 --> 16:18.829
you're just soft enough
to be able to do that.

16:21.267 --> 16:22.700
You got this.

16:27.273 --> 16:28.605
Hey!

16:28.708 --> 16:31.642
You just made me miss the little
zombie girl eating a foot!

16:31.678 --> 16:34.444
I just wanted to tell you
that I've decided to tell Mom

16:34.480 --> 16:36.981
that I actually don't want
the babysitting job after all.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.749
- Fine with me.
- Good.

16:38.818 --> 16:41.052
So, I guess it's after-school
activities for us.

16:41.154 --> 16:42.219
What? Wrong.

16:42.288 --> 16:44.321
Soraya don't do after-school activities.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.789
Well, Soraya do now.

16:45.857 --> 16:47.324
Thanks to Dad following his dreams,

16:47.393 --> 16:49.393
we can't afford a new babysitter, so...

16:49.461 --> 16:51.261
if I'm out, their only option will be

16:51.330 --> 16:52.929
to enroll us in two-to-four hours

16:52.998 --> 16:55.031
of extremely supervised activities.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.667
Like Mathletes?

16:56.768 --> 16:59.836
Exactly like Mathletes.

16:59.871 --> 17:03.340
And, trust me, I was just
like you when I was your age.

17:03.409 --> 17:05.709
And then I did one day
of Mathletes, and boom.

17:05.777 --> 17:08.278
Things just sort of
snowballed from there.

17:08.380 --> 17:10.479
When you look at me,
you're seeing your future.

17:10.548 --> 17:13.316
Okay, okay. That can't happen to me.

17:13.384 --> 17:15.617
That's what I thought.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.686
Rosalba, there's something
I need to talk to you about,

17:17.789 --> 17:19.387
and it's very, very difficult
for me to say,

17:19.457 --> 17:20.489
but it needs to be said,

17:20.558 --> 17:21.891
and it really has to be said right now.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.626
- I want to talk to you, too.
- Okay, you go first.

17:23.729 --> 17:24.993
And take as much time as you need.

17:25.097 --> 17:26.429
No. No, no, no, no. Sorry.

17:26.497 --> 17:27.931
That's the old Alex.
That's the old Alex.

17:28.032 --> 17:30.233
I can do this.

17:30.335 --> 17:31.701
Rosalba.

17:31.803 --> 17:33.068
You can't work here anymore.

17:33.137 --> 17:34.203
No, Rosalba...

17:34.272 --> 17:36.505
let me finish.

17:36.608 --> 17:39.208
You'll always be a very dear
friend to our family.

17:39.277 --> 17:40.643
But this company means too much

17:40.712 --> 17:43.912
to have someone who isn't
a perfect fit stay on board.

17:43.981 --> 17:45.414
Now, did you have something
you wanted to say?

17:45.483 --> 17:47.316
I cannot work for you anymore.

17:47.418 --> 17:48.917
- What?
- Yeah.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.786
I wrote you an e-mail.

17:50.855 --> 17:52.921
It's handwritten.

17:53.924 --> 17:55.691
It says that you'd like to retire.

17:55.793 --> 17:57.259
You've worked for many years,

17:57.327 --> 18:00.395
and you'd like to spend more
time with your grandchildren.

18:00.430 --> 18:03.030
"I only took this job because
I didn't want to let you down.

18:03.099 --> 18:05.933
Also, there's a cruise
I've heard about called Hedonism

18:06.002 --> 18:08.336
that leaves for Barbados in a month.

18:08.405 --> 18:09.871
Apparently anything goes...

18:09.973 --> 18:11.406
if you know what I mean."

18:11.508 --> 18:12.674
I do.

18:12.776 --> 18:14.075
Well, look.

18:14.144 --> 18:15.543
I think it all worked out. Right?

18:15.612 --> 18:17.979
But, hey, for the record,
I fired you first, right?

18:18.047 --> 18:18.946
Mm.

18:19.048 --> 18:20.348
For the record if you say so.

18:20.450 --> 18:21.349
I <i> do</i> say so.

18:22.451 --> 18:23.751
Okay. Hey, let's have a hug.

18:23.853 --> 18:24.819
- Those are the best.
- Oh.

18:24.921 --> 18:26.687
I'm gonna miss these. You're the best.

18:26.756 --> 18:28.756
- So strong.
- Mm.

18:28.825 --> 18:30.091
Hey, uh...

18:30.193 --> 18:32.860
next week, you want to maybe come by

18:32.962 --> 18:34.361
and say goodbye to the kids?

18:34.430 --> 18:35.729
No, I'm good.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.567
Ben?! Soraya?!

18:40.670 --> 18:44.104
Oh, my God, this place looks amazing!

18:44.206 --> 18:45.238
Well, why wouldn't it?

18:45.307 --> 18:46.673
Well, I don't know.

18:46.775 --> 18:48.308
I just thought that...

18:48.376 --> 18:50.110
Did you get your father's
pie stain out of the rug?

18:50.179 --> 18:53.146
The secret is blotting the stain
from the outside in.

18:53.248 --> 18:55.648
- Outside in. Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.517
Wow. Guys, I am really impressed.

18:57.585 --> 18:59.352
You get what you pay for
with Ben Schuman.

18:59.454 --> 19:01.154
You get what you pay for
with Ben Schuman.

19:01.256 --> 19:02.488
I see that.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.425
Did you really think something bad

19:05.493 --> 19:06.759
was gonna happen with Ben around?

19:06.829 --> 19:08.195
I mean, he booby-trapped the whole house

19:08.297 --> 19:09.296
like it was "Home Alone."

19:09.397 --> 19:11.131
There's still marbles
all over the stairs.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.131
I don't know.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.866
I had this whole story in my head.

19:13.968 --> 19:16.502
I thought it was gonna be
a complete disaster.

19:16.604 --> 19:18.838
I think part of me
wanted it to be a disaster.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.773
I mean, maybe not a disaster, but...

19:20.842 --> 19:23.710
at least a banged-up elbow
or a skinned knee.

19:23.812 --> 19:25.378
Something to show
that they still need me.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.313
Of course they still need you, baby.

19:27.415 --> 19:29.682
- Come on.
- Yeah, but not for long.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.576
Their childhood's gonna be over
before we know it.

19:31.601 --> 19:32.512
I know.

19:32.537 --> 19:34.911
Soraya told me she's interested
in going on Rumspringa.

19:34.989 --> 19:36.489
Look at me.

19:36.591 --> 19:38.122
I mean, I'm supposed to be the hard one,

19:38.225 --> 19:39.424
and I'm freaking out,

19:39.526 --> 19:42.060
and you haven't even thought
about Rosalba once today.

19:42.162 --> 19:44.529
Yep. She never crossed my mind.

19:45.632 --> 19:47.766
Can I sleep with you guys tonight?

19:47.868 --> 19:49.067
I'm scared.

19:49.169 --> 19:50.335
What are you scared of, bud?

19:50.437 --> 19:51.470
Well, you don't need a reason.

19:51.572 --> 19:52.871
Come on in here.

19:52.973 --> 19:54.506
Cute little unicorn.

19:54.608 --> 19:55.574
Get up here.

19:55.676 --> 19:56.775
Oh, hey, guys.

19:56.877 --> 19:58.977
Just checking
that everything's cool and...

19:59.079 --> 20:00.379
no zombies in here.

20:00.481 --> 20:02.312
Oh, are we doing
a... a family bed thing tonight?

20:02.415 --> 20:04.415
Okay. I'm down for that.

20:05.785 --> 20:08.986
- Get in here.
- Come in, buddy.

20:09.088 --> 20:10.988
Cuddle with me?

20:15.721 --> 20:18.533
Thank you for your service,
Gary Number 21.

20:18.619 --> 20:20.752
Say hello to all the other Garys.

20:22.256 --> 20:24.523
Whoa! Ben! Occupied! Occupied! Occupied!

20:24.625 --> 20:25.990
Dad, what are you doing?

20:26.093 --> 20:27.025
Okay, you know what?

20:27.127 --> 20:29.327
I can't hide bad news
from anyone anymore.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.029
I need to come clean.

20:31.131 --> 20:32.697
Gary died...

20:32.799 --> 20:34.398
seven years ago.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.367
Dad, how could you?!

20:36.469 --> 20:37.836
How could you...

20:37.938 --> 20:39.938
possibly think that I didn't know this?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.072
You knew?

20:41.174 --> 20:43.341
Gary Number 7 was a kosher hot dog!

20:43.443 --> 20:45.076
Yeah, I was very busy that week.

20:45.178 --> 20:46.778
Look, you don't need
to buy any more replacements.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.246
I-I don't even like fish.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.380
Are you sure?

20:49.482 --> 20:51.048
We just got a punch card
from the pet store.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.682
One more fish, we get a gerbil.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.818
- I don't want a gerbil.
- Okay.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.756
Say hello to Nemo.
