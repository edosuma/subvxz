WEBVTT

00:38.904 --> 00:41.575
Okay, fuck it.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.610
Here we go.

00:47.748 --> 00:48.747
Shit.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.929
Okay, there you go.

00:56.559 --> 00:57.921
Fuck.

00:57.956 --> 00:59.395
Oh, well.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.904
Hi, Leif.

02:33.524 --> 02:36.261
You like those so much,
don't you?

02:36.296 --> 02:38.461
Don't growl at me.

02:38.496 --> 02:39.726
I'm giving you stuff.

02:42.027 --> 02:44.027
Want this?

02:44.062 --> 02:46.029
What kind of tricks
can you do?

02:46.064 --> 02:48.570
Can you go around?

02:48.605 --> 02:50.077
Ah.

02:52.675 --> 02:54.675
You're too teethy, honey.

02:56.712 --> 02:58.052
Here.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.487
Leif?

03:04.522 --> 03:05.983
Leif, are you there?

03:07.756 --> 03:09.129
Leif?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.990
Leif!

03:13.025 --> 03:16.895
- Hey.
- Hi. Remember me?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.502
Not really, no.

03:19.537 --> 03:22.505
It's Missy.
Aunt Missy, remember?

03:22.540 --> 03:24.870
I was in the spiritual community
with your mother and you

03:24.905 --> 03:26.476
when you were a little boy.

03:26.511 --> 03:30.513
- Okay.
- Wow, you got old.

03:30.548 --> 03:32.284
You know what?
Give me a second, Missy.

03:32.319 --> 03:35.551
- Let me put a shirt on.
- I like your overalls.

03:42.362 --> 03:45.594
So, uh,
what can I do for you?

03:45.629 --> 03:47.530
I wanted to let you know,

03:47.565 --> 03:49.532
I wanted to tell you
in person,

03:49.567 --> 03:53.096
and I just, uh, wanted to,

03:53.131 --> 03:56.539
more than anything, uh...

03:56.574 --> 03:58.145
your mom died.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.346
I'm sorry.

04:10.753 --> 04:12.489
All right, I'll come down.

04:14.427 --> 04:16.922
She had cancer.
Found it too late

04:16.957 --> 04:20.563
and didn't get any treatment.
No chemo, nothing.

04:20.598 --> 04:23.566
- Oh.
- You know your mom with doctors and stuff.

04:23.601 --> 04:24.831
It just wasn't her thing.

04:24.866 --> 04:28.934
I do have some good news
for you, though.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.738
She left you her cabin.

04:30.773 --> 04:31.937
She left the cabin for me?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.576
- She did, she did.
- No way.

04:33.611 --> 04:35.776
Uh-huh.
But there is a catch.

04:35.811 --> 04:37.481
She felt like
there were some things

04:37.516 --> 04:39.142
she still needed
to teach you,

04:39.177 --> 04:40.484
but couldn't
get ahold of you,

04:40.519 --> 04:44.323
so she did this.

04:44.358 --> 04:46.952
A conditional inheritance.

04:46.987 --> 04:51.759
"I, Suzanne 'Honey' Reinhold
hereby leave my cabin to my son

04:51.794 --> 04:56.335
Leif Reinhold provided
he completes this list of tasks

04:56.370 --> 04:58.667
left for him at the cabin.

04:58.702 --> 05:01.670
Should he not complete the list,
the cabin will be sold

05:01.705 --> 05:05.773
and proceeds donated to the Theodore Payne
Foundation for Wildflowers and Native..."

05:05.808 --> 05:07.346
So there's a list
at the cabin?

05:07.381 --> 05:10.481
Yes, yes.
And if you don't do those things...

05:10.516 --> 05:13.176
- Yeah.
- ...you will not get the cabin.

05:13.211 --> 05:15.178
- And this is legal?
- Yeah, it is.

05:15.213 --> 05:17.015
- Unfortunately, you have...
- Okay.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.116
Hey, uh, do you know
what's on the list?

05:19.151 --> 05:21.789
No. I have no idea
what's on this list.

05:21.824 --> 05:23.989
But knowing Honey,
it's gonna be wild.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.298
I can guarantee that.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.795
Right. That makes sense.
That makes sense.

05:27.830 --> 05:30.633
Do you own a gun?

05:30.668 --> 05:35.671
- No. Should I?
- No. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.841
So, Honey's dead.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.174
Weird, right?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.486
Yeah. Don't feel bad.
You didn't know her.

05:51.491 --> 05:54.426
I didn't really know her
either, to be honest.

05:54.461 --> 05:57.220
So sad she's dead
though, right?

05:57.255 --> 05:58.496
Do you feel sad?

06:01.160 --> 06:03.226
Sometimes I feel
like you understand

06:03.261 --> 06:05.228
every single thing
I'm saying,

06:05.263 --> 06:08.704
and other times I just
think you have dog brains.

06:11.313 --> 06:13.478
All right, fuck it.
Let's do it.

06:15.207 --> 06:17.845
What do we have to lose, right?
A weird week?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.364
Gorka?

06:33.896 --> 06:36.501
Stop banging on my window!

06:38.296 --> 06:40.307
Gorka?

06:42.036 --> 06:43.310
Gork.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.178
- I need to talk to you.
- What do you need, Leif?

06:54.213 --> 06:56.554
It's about the band and
my schedule. It's important.

06:56.589 --> 06:59.656
Ugh. Not now. I'm busy.

06:59.691 --> 07:02.054
- You're not busy.
- How do you know?

07:02.089 --> 07:05.365
'Cause I can literally see you
with your shirt off laying in bed.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.896
- That's how I know.
- That doesn't mean I'm not busy.

07:08.931 --> 07:11.734
- I'm thinking.
- It kind of means you're not busy.

07:11.769 --> 07:14.572
This is important, Gorka. Can you
please just come out here for a second?

07:14.607 --> 07:17.300
God's sake. Listen,
you're ruining my day.

07:17.335 --> 07:20.479
- I was busy.
- My mother's dead.

07:23.946 --> 07:26.144
Oh, I'm sorry for your loss.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.047
She may be surrounded by angels.

07:28.082 --> 07:30.280
She might be, but I have
some questions about schedule

07:30.315 --> 07:31.523
that I'd like to do now.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.924
- Meet me by the vegetables.
- Why can't we just do it now?

07:36.959 --> 07:38.629
Hey, and don't bring
your asshole dog.

07:38.664 --> 07:41.764
Don't call my dog
an asshole, you asshole.

07:41.799 --> 07:45.801
God damn it!
What's your problem?

07:49.642 --> 07:53.545
- Are you okay?
- Honest to God, close your robe a little bit, man.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.338
- I can see everything.
- Fuck, it's so hot.

07:55.373 --> 07:57.142
You know what?
Let's have some wine inside.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.111
Hey, Gorka, let me just ask
you a scheduling question.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.344
- Come inside. Let's have some wine.
- Am I free to leave next week?

08:01.379 --> 08:03.357
Let's have some wine.

08:04.987 --> 08:07.988
- Gorka, can we please?
- One second.

08:10.993 --> 08:13.026
Losing a mother
is a terrible thing.

08:13.061 --> 08:15.798
Something you'll never forget.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.196
It only happens once
in your lifetime.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.706
Yeah, that makes sense.

08:22.741 --> 08:25.643
Hey, can I ask you
a scheduling question just...

08:25.678 --> 08:28.371
- Can I say something first?
- It's pretty important that I get this out of the way.

08:28.406 --> 08:32.419
Your mother abandoned you as a
12-year-old boy for a cult, didn't she?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.379
She left you to fend
for yourself, didn't she?

08:36.414 --> 08:40.383
- Correct.
- And then, sure, since you grew up,

08:40.418 --> 08:43.386
she has tried occasionally to come
to see a concert and call you, right?

08:43.421 --> 08:46.158
- She has, yeah.
- To fix your failed relationship.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.128
I don't know that.
I never called her back.

08:49.163 --> 08:51.229
But now she's dead.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.638
But now she's dead.

08:53.673 --> 08:56.102
Well, I do not weep
for that woman.

08:56.137 --> 08:59.677
Fuck that woman.
Fuck this person, this asshole.

08:59.712 --> 09:03.340
I have zero love for that woman like
this, abandoning her child.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.618
- You finished?
- I'm finished.

09:06.653 --> 09:09.654
- Okay, so...
- Not even animals abandon their childs.

09:09.689 --> 09:10.853
Not even cockroaches.
Think about it.

09:10.888 --> 09:12.888
Your mother is worse
than a cockroach.

09:12.923 --> 09:15.726
I don't think cockroaches
raise their kids.

09:15.761 --> 09:18.993
Don't talk to me about cockroaches
because I am very familiar.

09:19.028 --> 09:22.161
They're like a herd. They take care
of each other. They're like elephants.

09:22.196 --> 09:24.867
- That is not accurate.
- By the way, you're cabin is full of cockroaches.

09:24.902 --> 09:27.430
- We have to take care of that.
- Can I please ask my question?

09:27.465 --> 09:31.434
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Can I leave for a little bit and miss a rehearsal or two?

09:31.469 --> 09:34.008
I gotta go run up to her
cabin up near Yosemite.

09:34.043 --> 09:37.583
- Of course you can.
- Great.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.585
'Cause I don't want to lose the band.
It's a big priority for me.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.247
- No, no, you can go.
- You'll talk to them?

09:42.282 --> 09:45.283
Yeah, I will talk to them,
and if a gig comes up, I'll just call you.

09:46.726 --> 09:50.420
- That was it.
- You woke me up for that?

09:50.455 --> 09:52.059
Well, I woke you up
to tell you my mother died

09:52.094 --> 09:55.293
and ask if I could
leave for a week, yes.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.097
All right. Cheers.

09:57.132 --> 10:01.233
- Cheers.
- To your dead, shitty, asshole mother.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.741
- Cheers, bud.
- Cheers.

10:07.747 --> 10:11.078
- That's actually a really shitty wine, man.
- I know.

10:42.111 --> 10:43.979
All right, let's go.

10:48.249 --> 10:49.655
Good girl.

10:52.286 --> 10:53.659
Okay.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.761
([engine starting)

10:56.796 --> 10:58.994
Leif, hey!

10:59.029 --> 11:01.326
I was thinking
about it last night

11:01.361 --> 11:03.867
and you shouldn't be
resentful with your mother.

11:03.902 --> 11:07.233
- Twice she came to see you, but you never...
- I cannot hear you.

11:07.268 --> 11:09.675
- So maybe you...
- Gorka, I cannot hear you.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.908
...her being a bad mother, you know what I mean?

11:11.943 --> 11:13.778
You said it yourself.

11:13.813 --> 11:16.506
She tried to apologize, but
you never gave her the chance.

11:16.541 --> 11:18.882
You can't live
with that anger inside.

11:18.917 --> 11:21.478
- You have to forgive.
- Okay, thank you.

11:21.513 --> 11:23.557
Will you do that?
Do you understand?

11:26.793 --> 11:29.156
Cheers, my friend.
All the best.

12:30.087 --> 12:33.055
If my mother's one thing, Nora,
it's unpredictable.

12:33.090 --> 12:36.421
This list could be...
it could be anything.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.225
I mean, it could
take us anywhere.

12:38.260 --> 12:41.426
Anything. I could be
taking you literally anywhere

12:41.461 --> 12:42.801
and you don't know.

12:42.836 --> 12:45.232
I wish I had dog brains
half the time.

12:45.267 --> 12:48.070
It would make life easier.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.302
All right, come on, kid.
Come on.

13:28.706 --> 13:29.782
Wow.

13:32.710 --> 13:35.117
What do you think?

13:35.152 --> 13:36.514
Kind of nice.

13:41.928 --> 13:43.961
Looks like
she's still painting.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.331
This is where I got
my artistic side.

13:55.007 --> 13:56.336
Nice mustache.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.764
Yeah, nunchucks.

14:40.283 --> 14:42.745
Look at that little shit.

14:42.780 --> 14:44.615
Little bongo man.

14:52.229 --> 14:53.800
Look at that.

15:01.403 --> 15:04.404
Okay, let's share
our last joint.

15:32.071 --> 15:33.268
I don't know.

15:36.075 --> 15:39.846
That was my dog growing up.
He didn't have a name.

15:39.881 --> 15:43.014
Honey believed that animals
shouldn't be named,

15:43.049 --> 15:46.083
but apparently she was okay
with them wearing wigs.

15:48.054 --> 15:51.286
Makes no sense to me,
that woman.

16:08.470 --> 16:10.107
All right.

16:21.582 --> 16:24.385
Honey, what the fuck?

16:27.489 --> 16:29.324
Oh, shit.

16:45.342 --> 16:46.913
Ooh.

16:59.488 --> 17:02.786
Oh, why so many cabinets?

17:02.821 --> 17:05.723
Aah! Jesus.

17:20.542 --> 17:24.709
- Hello?
- Who the fuck is this?

17:24.744 --> 17:27.712
- Excuse me?
- Who the fuck is this?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.121
I'm sorry.
Are you looking for Honey?

17:30.156 --> 17:33.355
No, this is between
you and me now, sugar dick.

17:33.390 --> 17:35.357
You're just a piece of ass,
do you understand that?

17:35.392 --> 17:36.919
Did you just call me
a sugar dick?

17:36.954 --> 17:38.525
Yeah, that's all you are.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.923
You are just a piece
of candy ass.

17:40.958 --> 17:43.134
I'm a... I'm a candy ass?

17:43.169 --> 17:45.928
- Well, thank you for that, sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:45.963 --> 17:47.534
Thank you for calling me
a candy ass.

17:47.569 --> 17:50.207
You are nothing more
than a fuck boy!

17:50.242 --> 17:53.375
Fuck boy? Wow.
Okay, great.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.212
- You think this is funny?
- Kinda.

17:55.247 --> 17:57.379
All right, well, let's see
how long you're laughing.

17:57.414 --> 17:59.150
I didn't mean to laugh.

17:59.185 --> 18:02.219
It's just I haven't been called
a fuck boy in, well, ever.

18:02.254 --> 18:05.992
Ha-ha-ha. I promise you do not want
to go to war with me, young ass.

18:06.027 --> 18:09.226
- Okay, man, who is this?
- I'm coming for you, fuck boy!

18:30.007 --> 18:31.611
Of course.

18:50.027 --> 18:52.995
I'm too stoned for this.

18:53.030 --> 18:55.272
Yeah, sugar dick needs
to sober up.

18:57.111 --> 19:00.046
Nora, let's go
check out upstairs.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.651
Nora, please.
It's too loud.

19:21.498 --> 19:24.829
You awake? Psst.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.833
Can't sleep 'cause
it's a weird new place?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.675
You awake?

19:38.075 --> 19:40.812
Should we just go to the van,
get you some sleep?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.045
Yeah, let's go
to the van for you.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.355
I think you'll be
more comfortable there.

19:45.390 --> 19:47.489
All right.

19:49.053 --> 19:50.393
This is better, huh?

19:54.025 --> 19:56.366
Good night, Nora.

19:56.401 --> 19:59.666
Tomorrow,
we do the list, okay?

19:59.701 --> 20:01.668
And we get a cabin.

20:32.272 --> 20:36.637
Hi, Leif. Hi. Hi.

20:36.672 --> 20:39.442
Wow, look at me talking to you
even though I'm dead.

20:39.477 --> 20:42.445
That's trippy, right?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.711
You probably thought you were
finally rid of me, didn't you?

20:44.746 --> 20:46.977
Well, afraid not.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.012
See, energy
cannot be destroyed,

20:49.047 --> 20:53.357
so I'm still here
spiritually in this room

20:53.392 --> 20:56.393
watching you watch me.

20:56.428 --> 20:58.593
I'm right there.

20:58.628 --> 21:02.630
I'm right behind you. Boo!

21:06.669 --> 21:08.438
Oh, that was a good one.
I got you.

21:08.473 --> 21:10.770
- Nope.
- I got you, I know. Yeah, I did.

21:10.805 --> 21:16.578
Oh, okay.
Well, this is the deal.

21:16.613 --> 21:18.943
Um, I made this video.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.418
Uh, I'm doing this...

21:21.453 --> 21:24.949
well, I know...

21:24.984 --> 21:30.592
I wasn't the mother
that you wished I'd been.

21:30.627 --> 21:33.760
And I... I didn't fulfill
my motherly responsibilities.

21:33.795 --> 21:37.962
I did not teach you enough
stuff, and now I'm dead.

21:37.997 --> 21:43.770
So, I'm going
to make this list

21:43.805 --> 21:48.412
of all the things that
are so important that I know,

21:48.447 --> 21:52.647
and I'm gonna pass it
on to you with this video.

21:55.289 --> 21:58.686
Yeah, so,

21:58.721 --> 22:03.988
face me and say,

22:04.023 --> 22:06.188
"Honey,

22:06.223 --> 22:10.566
I promise that I will
do my best to do this list."

22:11.998 --> 22:14.999
I will do the list, Honey.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.836
I'll try my hardest.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.074
Come on,
say it for your mom.

22:24.109 --> 22:27.044
- I'll wait.
- Just did it.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.717
Don't be shy. I can wait.

22:29.752 --> 22:32.324
I can wait all night. I'm dead.
I'm not going anywhere.

22:32.359 --> 22:35.327
Your gaps aren't working.
I did it the first time.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.660
Good boy. Okay.

22:38.695 --> 22:44.468
So, number one is called

22:44.503 --> 22:46.272
express yourself.

22:46.307 --> 22:49.836
Take the envelope
and go into the garage

22:49.871 --> 22:52.674
and get the green boat,
which is pretty heavy.

22:52.709 --> 22:55.842
But, you know, what's success
without a bit of struggle?

22:55.877 --> 22:59.043
And then you open
the envelope

22:59.078 --> 23:00.748
and there's more instructions.

23:00.783 --> 23:03.113
That's kind of fun, right?

23:03.148 --> 23:06.754
Good. That's it.
Stop the tape.

23:06.789 --> 23:10.692
Are you lingering?
Don't... don't linger.

23:10.727 --> 23:12.221
You have to do these
one at a time.

23:12.256 --> 23:15.499
Please stop the tape.
Stop it, please.

23:15.534 --> 23:18.898
- I fucking tried so hard to get this all set up.
- Okay, okay. Shut up.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.505
Oh, my God.

23:37.985 --> 23:41.459
Oh. Oh, is that heavy.

23:41.494 --> 23:43.890
Oh, fuck me.

23:43.925 --> 23:46.189
I hate you, Honey.

23:46.224 --> 23:47.960
Okay.

23:51.328 --> 23:54.098
Okay. Okay.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.639
Let's see what I'm doing.

23:57.939 --> 24:01.039
All right, first.

24:01.074 --> 24:06.352
"Talk about your feelings
about me and my death."

24:07.344 --> 24:09.080
You gotta be kidding me.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.752
I didn't have to bring
a fucking boat

24:10.787 --> 24:12.787
down to the lake for that.

24:12.822 --> 24:17.121
"You hold too much inside.
It's like poison."

24:17.156 --> 24:20.531
Okay. Do you want to know how
I feel about your death?

24:20.566 --> 24:23.325
Nothing.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.931
I know I should feel sad,
but I don't.

24:24.966 --> 24:26.933
I feel nothing.

24:26.968 --> 24:31.333
So, sorry, but, uh,

24:31.368 --> 24:33.302
we didn't know
each other enough.

24:33.337 --> 24:37.273
Watch me.

24:37.308 --> 24:41.310
Good. Then row to
the other side of the lake,

24:41.345 --> 24:43.312
and while you're rowing,

24:43.347 --> 24:45.589
enjoy the water.

24:45.624 --> 24:47.756
Feel its energy.

24:47.791 --> 24:49.560
I did this journey daily
for years.

24:49.595 --> 24:51.958
It was one of my escapes.

24:51.993 --> 24:56.358
In the middle of the lake,
I allowed myself to miss you

24:56.393 --> 24:58.569
and to think about regrets.

24:58.604 --> 25:00.362
You can do it, too,
if you want.

25:00.397 --> 25:02.166
I mean,
we all have regrets, Leif.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.366
It's normal.

25:04.401 --> 25:07.578
Now, your next task.

25:07.613 --> 25:09.371
You're looking for a house

25:09.406 --> 25:12.847
that's brown
with a green roof.

25:12.882 --> 25:14.618
It's really easy to find.

25:14.653 --> 25:16.345
You can't miss it
unless you're super high.

25:20.021 --> 25:21.988
Okay.

25:22.023 --> 25:23.528
Use the key provided...

25:32.539 --> 25:36.200
...then drop the envelope
marked "C" on the pillow

25:36.235 --> 25:39.643
in the back bedroom,

25:39.678 --> 25:42.206
and then get your ass
out of there.

25:56.057 --> 25:57.056
Easy enough.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.981
"Hey, dipshit!
I owe you nothing, you rat fuck!"

26:23.216 --> 26:25.051
All right, what am I doing?

26:25.086 --> 26:27.691
This is insane. Okay.

26:27.726 --> 26:29.088
All right, let's go.

27:45.529 --> 27:48.332
Fuck!

27:48.367 --> 27:50.367
Congratulations.
You did it.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.270
Congrats?
I could have been killed.

27:52.305 --> 27:54.778
You went to the lake
and you expressed yourself

27:54.813 --> 27:57.781
and you took all that toxic
energy and you got rid of it,

27:57.816 --> 27:59.981
because if you don't,
that's gonna kill you.

28:00.016 --> 28:02.753
I am so happy for you.
I am so happy for you.

28:02.788 --> 28:05.349
I'm happy for me, too.
That's great.

28:05.384 --> 28:08.792
In terms of breaking into
the guy's house, okay,

28:08.827 --> 28:12.554
um, well,

28:12.589 --> 28:14.798
I can't say that
that was a lesson.

28:14.833 --> 28:18.362
Uh, honestly, he was just an
ass and it needed to be done,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.738
and you did your mom a solid,
so thank you.

28:20.773 --> 28:22.168
Oh, for fuck's sake.

28:22.203 --> 28:24.170
Okay, so now
I can go on to two.

28:24.205 --> 28:27.008
You're gonna like this one.

28:27.043 --> 28:30.077
Love is important.

28:30.112 --> 28:32.541
Now, I've Googled you
and I know that you don't

28:32.576 --> 28:35.181
have a girlfriend
or a boyfriend,

28:35.216 --> 28:39.020
so I want you to call
the one who got away

28:39.055 --> 28:41.792
and say you're sorry.

28:41.827 --> 28:45.554
Oh, you know who that is.
I don't have to tell you.

28:45.589 --> 28:47.831
You know, you hold
too many grudges, sweetheart.

28:47.866 --> 28:49.591
I mean, if somebody hurts
your feelings, you're just...

28:49.626 --> 28:51.593
you just write them off.
They're done, that's it.

28:51.628 --> 28:54.035
Gone.

28:54.070 --> 28:58.534
So go ahead, do it now.
Make the call.

28:58.569 --> 29:02.406
All right. All right.
I'll call an ex-girlfriend.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.210
This one's easy.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.445
I'm definitely
not calling Marnie.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.216
She's insane.

29:10.251 --> 29:12.086
I'm not calling Ayako.

29:12.121 --> 29:13.857
Stephanie's not the one
that got away.

29:13.892 --> 29:18.224
Stephanie's the one
I can't get rid of.

29:18.259 --> 29:22.063
Not Judy, that's for sure.

29:22.098 --> 29:26.232
Could it be Lindsey?
Did Lindsey get away? No.

29:26.267 --> 29:28.630
Lindsey's dad was cool.

29:28.665 --> 29:31.237
We used to go fishing.
He was fun.

29:31.272 --> 29:33.470
Maybe her dad's the one
that got away.

29:36.112 --> 29:39.278
But I guess
it could be Audrey.

29:39.313 --> 29:42.248
Yeah, maybe it's Audrey, Nora.

29:42.283 --> 29:44.789
Maybe Audrey got away.

29:44.824 --> 29:48.727
At least she'll be funny
about it, right?

29:48.762 --> 29:50.652
Sorry that, uh...

29:50.687 --> 29:52.654
and then, um, I hope if I...

29:52.689 --> 29:54.095
yeah, that you forgive me

29:54.130 --> 29:56.460
and I don't want
any hard feelings.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.661
So, I just, you know...

29:59.696 --> 30:01.300
I think you're a cool person.

30:10.146 --> 30:13.917
- Hello?
- Hey, is that Audrey?

30:13.952 --> 30:17.723
- Yeah. Who's this?
- Hey, Audrey. It's Leif.

30:21.157 --> 30:22.959
Um, old on a sec.

30:27.724 --> 30:29.196
Hi, I'm sorry.
Who did you say this was?

30:29.231 --> 30:32.936
Oh, yeah, it's Leif.

30:32.971 --> 30:34.498
- Leif.
- Yeah, Leif.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.368
Sorry, is that
a name or a word?

30:36.403 --> 30:38.909
Do you not remem...

30:38.944 --> 30:40.504
Audrey, it's Leif Reinhold.

30:40.539 --> 30:44.706
We dated for about three years.

30:44.741 --> 30:48.314
Right, of course.
And when was that?

30:48.349 --> 30:50.822
How many people have
you dated named Leif?

30:50.857 --> 30:52.824
Shoot. You know what?
Here's what we should do.

30:52.859 --> 30:55.321
Why don't you give me your phone
number, I'll write it down,

30:55.356 --> 30:58.159
and then if I can
remember who you are,

30:58.194 --> 31:00.425
I'll just give you
a call back.

31:00.460 --> 31:04.935
Uh, yeah, fine.

31:04.970 --> 31:10.534
- It's 323-44...
- Ooh!

31:10.569 --> 31:12.976
You started giving me
your number

31:13.011 --> 31:14.340
- because you thought I couldn't remember you.
- Nice. Well done.

31:14.375 --> 31:18.344
- You total asshole.
- You're so dumb, Leif.

31:18.379 --> 31:22.744
Oh, buddy. How are you, bud?
I haven't seen you forever.

31:22.779 --> 31:26.957
Good. You know, apart from the
heart attack you gave me, I'm good.

31:26.992 --> 31:32.963
- How are you?
- Let's see. How am I the last eight years?

31:32.998 --> 31:36.263
- I'm good.
- Let's go with good. Well, good.

31:36.298 --> 31:39.563
- How are you?
- I'm, uh... well, I mean, yeah, good.

31:39.598 --> 31:43.204
besides, um, my...

31:43.239 --> 31:45.811
um, my mother died.

31:47.804 --> 31:51.575
- Huh.
- Yeah, she had cancer, so...

31:51.610 --> 31:54.380
Is that a...
is that a good thing?

31:54.415 --> 31:57.020
Is that a good thing
that my mom died?

31:57.055 --> 31:59.781
No, hold on. I mean, like,
because you didn't really like her.

31:59.816 --> 32:01.992
- You kind of hated her, right?
- No, I didn't kind of hate her.

32:02.027 --> 32:03.389
I just didn't know her.

32:03.424 --> 32:04.786
You guys didn't
really get along.

32:04.821 --> 32:06.590
No, I did not hate my mother.

32:06.625 --> 32:10.836
You kind of had, like,
weird mommy issues with her.

32:10.871 --> 32:14.235
I did not have mommy issues.

32:14.270 --> 32:16.908
I'm so glad I called you.
This has been wonderful.

32:16.943 --> 32:20.802
Okay, so why
are you calling me?

32:20.837 --> 32:23.244
Do you need money or something?
I don't have money.

32:23.279 --> 32:24.740
Call the next person
on your list.

32:24.775 --> 32:27.248
I don't need money.

32:27.283 --> 32:29.646
When my mom died,
she left me her cabin,

32:29.681 --> 32:33.353
but she did this thing
that's annoying

32:33.388 --> 32:35.025
but it's
a conditional inheritance.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.818
I have to do this to-do list

32:36.853 --> 32:38.820
she put together
in order to get it.

32:38.855 --> 32:40.624
Wait, so she's like,
I love you,

32:40.659 --> 32:42.824
but my love is conditional
on whether or not

32:42.859 --> 32:44.364
you can complete these tasks?

32:44.399 --> 32:47.268
- Yeah, it's exactly that.
- Oof. Okay.

32:47.303 --> 32:48.830
So what are the tasks?

32:48.865 --> 32:52.438
Well, one of the tasks is to...

32:52.473 --> 32:56.079
is to the call the one
that got away and say...

32:56.114 --> 32:57.113
and say sorry.

32:57.148 --> 33:01.051
So why are you calling me?

33:01.086 --> 33:03.647
Oh! Wait a second.
Hold on.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.847
Am I the one
that got away, Leif?

33:05.882 --> 33:09.653
I mean, you might be.
The early 2000s are a total blur.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.293
Here's what I do know.
I still have your phone number.

33:12.328 --> 33:13.789
Wow. God.

33:13.824 --> 33:18.464
That is so romantic
and so weird, but...

33:18.499 --> 33:20.664
Good.
Well, I'm glad it's nice.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.864
I don't know.
I kind of like it.

33:22.899 --> 33:24.305
So how are you doing
with all this?

33:24.340 --> 33:26.802
With the death and everything?

33:26.837 --> 33:28.672
Oh, uh, you know,

33:28.707 --> 33:30.674
honestly, I'm not
feeling much of anything.

33:30.709 --> 33:35.316
I'm... I didn't call you to,
you know... how are you doing?

33:35.351 --> 33:37.879
With your mom's death?
I mean, I'm okay.

33:37.914 --> 33:39.188
I didn't know her
that well either.

33:39.223 --> 33:41.520
No, you asshole.
With your life.

33:41.555 --> 33:44.886
In my life. Hmm.

33:44.921 --> 33:46.855
I'm fine.

33:46.890 --> 33:52.498
Fine. Fine.
Well, I don't know, are you married?

33:52.533 --> 33:53.532
Single?

33:53.567 --> 33:55.501
Working?

33:55.536 --> 33:57.899
Traveling with the circus?

33:57.934 --> 33:59.901
My boyfriend
and I just split up,

33:59.936 --> 34:01.903
so I'm dealing
with break-up stuff,

34:01.938 --> 34:03.740
and, you know,
break up stuff is not fun.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.908
Well, what happened?

34:06.943 --> 34:08.910
Let's just be girlfriends
and gab about it.

34:08.945 --> 34:11.913
It's complicated.
I don't want to talk about it. It's dumb.

34:11.948 --> 34:14.718
- It's nothing.
- I just told you my mother died.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.127
- You owe me something.
- Okay. That's a good point.

34:17.162 --> 34:21.527
It's just that it's boring and
you're going to judge me for it.

34:21.562 --> 34:26.532
I am alone in my dead
mother's cabin feeling nothing.

34:26.567 --> 34:29.931
- I would love to judge you.
- Okay. You know what?

34:29.966 --> 34:33.374
Let me, um... let me just call you back
in, like, ten minutes.

34:33.409 --> 34:36.146
- Are you around?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah.

34:36.181 --> 34:38.775
- Great. Okay, bye.
- Bye, Leif.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.291
She's great, right?
That's Audrey.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.954
She's going to call back.
I'm going to take a quick shower.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.099
I don't want... yeah,
I'm going to take a shower.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.804
Coming! Coming!

35:11.612 --> 35:12.611
Hello.

35:12.646 --> 35:14.976
Why are you out of breath?

35:15.011 --> 35:16.582
Oh, I just got out
of the shower.

35:16.617 --> 35:18.188
I had to run downstairs.

35:18.223 --> 35:20.421
You took a shower? Why?

35:20.456 --> 35:21.983
I realized while
we were talking

35:22.018 --> 35:23.226
I hadn't showered
in a little bit,

35:23.261 --> 35:24.986
so I thought
I'd take a shower.

35:25.021 --> 35:27.593
You do know that I can't smell
you over the phone, right?

35:27.628 --> 35:29.859
Right, well, I wasn't
willing to take any chances.

35:29.894 --> 35:32.796
Why? Did you not take a shower
since the last time we talked?

35:32.831 --> 35:36.338
Since we hung up ten minutes ago?
No, I didn't take a shower.

35:36.373 --> 35:40.606
Gross. All right,
so tell me about this guy.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.443
I'm dying to judge you.

35:42.478 --> 35:44.511
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

35:44.546 --> 35:47.613
Let's change the subject.
Tell me what you're up to.

35:47.648 --> 35:49.153
What's going on in your life?

35:49.188 --> 35:52.750
Uh, yeah, I mean,
I'm still making music.

35:52.785 --> 35:57.018
I'm in a band right now with some super
talented kid. It's called Restaurant.

35:57.053 --> 35:59.625
- We've actually just finished touring Asia.
- Hold on now.

35:59.660 --> 36:03.024
Did you just say you're in
a band called Restaurant, sir?

36:04.599 --> 36:06.467
Yeah, I'm in a band
called Restaurant.

36:06.502 --> 36:08.139
That's not good.

36:08.174 --> 36:10.031
Really, it's such
a talented group

36:10.066 --> 36:11.835
of smart musicians,
and I think...

36:14.675 --> 36:17.478
Audrey?
Audrey, are you drilling?

36:17.513 --> 36:19.711
There's all of a sudden
a really weird sound.

36:19.746 --> 36:22.846
No. Sorry, sorry.
I'm making soup.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.849
I'm just... I thought
it would be quieter. Sorry.

36:25.884 --> 36:28.049
Did you just start
when I started talking?

36:28.084 --> 36:29.655
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

36:29.690 --> 36:31.657
Tell me more about your band.

36:31.692 --> 36:34.627
Uh, yeah.
These kids are so good.

36:34.662 --> 36:37.300
I feel like we could hit
a pop song or two,

36:37.335 --> 36:40.270
and I really... I feel like...

36:40.305 --> 36:43.669
- Hey! Audrey!
- Hee-hee.

36:43.704 --> 36:47.068
I'm not falling for it.
I'm not falling for it again.

36:47.103 --> 36:49.279
Okay, will you just wait
while I make this soup

36:49.314 --> 36:50.874
and then we can really talk?

36:50.909 --> 36:52.876
You want me to wait
while you make soup.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.516
Just wait.
What else are you doing?

36:55.551 --> 36:57.078
Fine, go make your soup.

36:57.113 --> 36:58.882
But I am telling you
about my band

36:58.917 --> 37:00.686
and my hopes
and my dreams later,

37:00.721 --> 37:02.127
and you are going to
pretend to care.

37:02.162 --> 37:05.526
- Okay, great.
- I'm hanging up.

37:05.561 --> 37:07.891
- I'm not going to wait.
- Leif?

37:07.926 --> 37:09.695
- Call me back.
- Leif, stop talking.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.301
Listen,
I'm going to just hang up

37:11.336 --> 37:12.335
and I'll call you back, okay?

37:12.370 --> 37:13.336
That's what I just said.

37:13.371 --> 37:17.637
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.873
Okay, the next task is called

37:22.908 --> 37:27.185
eat what you kill.

37:27.220 --> 37:30.716
Now, you have to know

37:30.751 --> 37:35.358
how to survive on your own
in the wild.

37:35.393 --> 37:38.559
You have to know how to fight
for what you care about,

37:38.594 --> 37:41.364
- how to be passionate about what you love...
- This is insane.

37:41.399 --> 37:44.730
...how to stand up
to get what you want,

37:44.765 --> 37:46.094
make it known.

37:46.129 --> 37:50.131
Be the predator,
not the prey.

37:50.166 --> 37:52.738
Go catch a fish
with your hands.

37:52.773 --> 37:54.575
You know, throw a rock
on its head.

37:54.610 --> 37:56.940
Be part of the natural world.

39:34.479 --> 39:36.281
She's insane.

39:36.316 --> 39:38.041
Your mother
is a crazy person.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.846
- Yep.
- Aren't you supposed to be, like,

39:40.881 --> 39:42.881
apologizing to me
or something?

39:42.916 --> 39:45.950
Right.
I actually kind of forgot.

39:45.985 --> 39:49.525
Right. So, when are
you going to do it?

39:49.560 --> 39:53.056
Well, it can happen now.
Should I do it now?

39:53.091 --> 39:55.432
Yeah. Let's do it.
Get it over with.

39:55.467 --> 40:01.262
Okay. Audrey, I'm sorry.

40:01.297 --> 40:06.377
- For what?
- Um, I'm sorry for breaking your heart?

40:06.412 --> 40:09.875
- No, you didn't break my heart.
- I don't know.

40:09.910 --> 40:13.274
My mommy's making me do it
and I have major mommy issues.

40:13.309 --> 40:15.243
Okay, you happy now?
Do I get her cabin?

40:15.278 --> 40:18.246
Aww, that's not
a good apology. Come on.

40:18.281 --> 40:21.084
All right, well,
here's the truth.

40:21.119 --> 40:27.090
Um, I'm sorry if I didn't,
you know, fight for us

40:27.125 --> 40:31.292
because honestly
you're the smartest

40:31.327 --> 40:34.097
and the funniest and the
sexiest person I've ever dated

40:34.132 --> 40:38.541
and I'm sorry
I fucked it up.

40:38.576 --> 40:39.773
You are?

40:41.942 --> 40:44.305
Yeah.
If I could do it again,

40:44.340 --> 40:48.210
I would've done it differently.

40:48.245 --> 40:52.918
So, what?
You get your mom's cabin now?

40:52.953 --> 40:57.318
Well, no. I have to do
the rest of her list,

40:57.353 --> 40:58.924
but then I get her cabin, yeah.

40:58.959 --> 41:00.761
Wait, what do I get
out of this?

41:00.796 --> 41:03.324
- Do I get anything?
- No, you don't get anything.

41:03.359 --> 41:05.766
- Wait a sec...
- You get the apology.

41:05.801 --> 41:08.505
You got a raw deal. You got screwed.
I'm sorry for that.

41:08.540 --> 41:12.410
- That sucks.
- It's really not fair. It's a really raw deal.

41:12.445 --> 41:16.139
- I'm kind of drunk.
- Yeah, actually.

41:16.174 --> 41:19.549
Speaking of, me, too.

41:19.584 --> 41:21.782
I'm not going to have
phone sex with you.

41:21.817 --> 41:24.345
- Excuse me?
- I'm not going to have phone sex with you.

41:24.380 --> 41:26.655
That's a weird turn.
Who said anything about phone sex?

41:26.690 --> 41:30.186
Well, I'm just saying if that's why
you called me, I'm not doing that.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.957
That is not why I called.

41:31.992 --> 41:34.322
You're the one who keeps
talking about phone sex.

41:34.357 --> 41:38.095
Okay, well, tell me that
you're not thinking about it.

41:38.130 --> 41:41.362
Well, I am thinking about it
now because you brought it up,

41:41.397 --> 41:44.508
but I promise I wasn't
thinking about it before.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.104
So, should we do it?

41:47.139 --> 41:48.809
Okay, fuck it.
Let's do it.

41:48.844 --> 41:51.174
But I want to say
right off the bat,

41:51.209 --> 41:53.374
I don't think we're
going to be good at it.

41:53.409 --> 41:55.178
I think it's going to be
a little bit embarrassing.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.180
This was never
really our vibe.

41:57.215 --> 42:01.217
Okay, well, since I've been with
you, I've been with many a man.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.384
- Weird brag.
- What I mean is,

42:03.419 --> 42:06.090
I have gotten
really good at phone sex.

42:06.125 --> 42:09.830
All right.
Um, who goes first?

42:09.865 --> 42:11.898
How do you start phone sex?

42:14.430 --> 42:17.200
Um, okay.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.675
What am I wearing?

42:19.710 --> 42:22.645
I don't know.
Probably a pair of underpants.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.405
Okay, let's not
call them underpants.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.681
That's not sexy at all.

42:25.716 --> 42:29.718
Okay, what are you wearing?

42:32.250 --> 42:35.317
- I'd rather not say.
- Just say it.

42:35.352 --> 42:37.627
I'm wearing my favorite
pair of overalls.

42:37.662 --> 42:39.420
No. No, no, no, no. No.

42:39.455 --> 42:40.663
Leif, come on.

42:40.698 --> 42:43.028
I still wear
the same overalls

42:43.063 --> 42:44.502
that I wore when
we were together.

42:44.537 --> 42:47.032
Okay, don't say overalls.
You're ruining it.

42:47.067 --> 42:49.232
Okay, okay.
I'm wearing pants.

42:49.267 --> 42:50.937
Oh, you're so bad at this.

42:50.972 --> 42:56.844
Okay, I'm lying down now.
Are you touching me?

42:56.879 --> 42:58.879
Yes, I am. Very softly.

42:58.914 --> 43:00.683
So soft,
you could barely feel me.

43:00.718 --> 43:03.246
- No, rough.
- Rough, that's exactly what I was saying.

43:03.281 --> 43:06.590
I started soft, but then I went so
rough, like an animal.

43:06.625 --> 43:11.221
Okay, um, why don't you
take your pants off?

43:11.256 --> 43:14.257
You mean my overalls? Because it
is a whole thing to take these off.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.061
Stop saying overalls.

43:16.096 --> 43:17.392
Unless they're like...

43:17.427 --> 43:19.262
are they like fireman
overalls or something?

43:19.297 --> 43:22.265
Yeah, they're...
they're exactly like firemen.

43:22.300 --> 43:23.805
Well, I can tell
you're lying,

43:23.840 --> 43:25.708
so I want you to just
take your pants off.

43:25.743 --> 43:27.468
Now. Ready, go.

43:27.503 --> 43:30.713
You're the boss.

43:30.748 --> 43:32.275
Do I narrate it
or just do it

43:32.310 --> 43:33.914
and then come back
and talk to you?

43:33.949 --> 43:36.719
- Leif, come on.
- I'm just going to start.

43:36.754 --> 43:38.248
The shirt's coming off.

43:38.283 --> 43:42.285
Okay? Give me one second.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.660
Well, are you taking
your pants off?

43:43.695 --> 43:45.596
I can hit it.
Fucking one-button, man.

43:45.631 --> 43:48.324
Wait.

43:49.327 --> 43:50.766
Wait.

43:53.331 --> 43:56.299
I'm totally naked.

43:56.334 --> 44:01.304
I am rubbing you down hard.

44:01.339 --> 44:04.109
You're covered in oil.

44:04.144 --> 44:08.311
I just got off a shift
and I'm a fucking fireman.

44:14.352 --> 44:17.859
- Audrey?
- Leif, did you just fucking hang up on me?

44:17.894 --> 44:21.764
Fully accidental if I did.
My phone dropped.

44:21.799 --> 44:23.832
Did you hear anything
about the fireman thing?

44:23.867 --> 44:27.165
I'm going to go
do this by myself.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.530
- It's over?
- It's over.

44:29.565 --> 44:31.136
How could it be over?
It just started.

44:31.171 --> 44:34.337
- My overalls are half off.
- You blew it.

44:34.372 --> 44:38.143
Hey, will you come up here?

44:38.178 --> 44:40.442
To your dead mom's cabin?

44:40.477 --> 44:42.752
Well, I don't call it
my dead mom's cabin,

44:42.787 --> 44:45.953
but I'm dying to see you.

44:48.584 --> 44:50.551
Um, yeah.

44:50.586 --> 44:51.926
Yeah, I can come up on Friday.

44:51.961 --> 44:53.994
- This Friday?
- Yeah.

44:54.029 --> 44:56.227
Let me check my schedule.
I'm free.

44:57.835 --> 45:01.001
Okay. Okay. Great, yes.

45:01.036 --> 45:03.168
Medium sex
with my ex-boyfriend.

45:03.203 --> 45:04.565
Let's do this.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.369
Count on it.

45:06.404 --> 45:08.008
But don't count on it
being very long.

45:08.043 --> 45:10.010
I don't want the pressure.

45:10.045 --> 45:11.814
- See you Friday.
- Good night.

45:20.990 --> 45:23.023
I'm not going to do what
you think I'm going to do,

45:23.058 --> 45:25.762
but only out of respect
for our relationship.

45:27.260 --> 45:29.425
In fact,
I need to take a shower.

45:53.451 --> 45:56.221
Hey, that's enough.

46:02.834 --> 46:04.229
Nora, stop it.

46:04.264 --> 46:06.396
What do you want?

46:09.467 --> 46:12.435
Hey! Can I help you?

46:12.470 --> 46:14.338
Hey!

46:36.494 --> 46:40.771
Hey! What do you want?

46:54.952 --> 46:56.611
Right.

46:56.646 --> 46:58.987
Who the fuck is this?

47:00.320 --> 47:01.550
It is Gorka.

47:01.585 --> 47:02.925
Why are you yelling at me?

47:02.960 --> 47:04.157
Oh, I'm sorry, Gorka.

47:04.192 --> 47:06.929
It's... what's going on?
How are you?

47:06.964 --> 47:08.524
I'm good and I'm bad,
my friend. Listen.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.691
I won't dance around
this subject

47:10.726 --> 47:13.133
because I have
too much respect for you.

47:13.168 --> 47:14.695
I've known you
for too many years,

47:14.730 --> 47:16.840
too many roads,
too many bus tours.

47:16.875 --> 47:18.908
Too many girls, too many bands,
too many stories we share.

47:18.943 --> 47:21.944
You're dancing around the subject.
What's up, Gorka?

47:21.979 --> 47:25.244
The band wants you out
and I can't believe it.

47:25.279 --> 47:28.148
- What?
- It's not personal.

47:28.183 --> 47:30.348
It's just your style,
your energy,

47:30.383 --> 47:33.351
your vibe,
and your personality doesn't fit in.

47:33.386 --> 47:37.520
My personality, Gorka?
How is that not personal?

47:37.555 --> 47:40.160
- It's my personality.
- Also the fact that you're older

47:40.195 --> 47:43.900
than the rest of the band members by,
like, 20 years, and you play the bongos.

47:43.935 --> 47:45.836
I'm a percussionist.
I don't just play bongos.

47:45.871 --> 47:47.728
Well, you favor
the bongos too much.

47:47.763 --> 47:49.532
Fuck off, Gorka.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.974
I don't favor bongos too much.

47:52.009 --> 47:54.504
Maybe it's not cool to have
an older bongo player.

47:54.539 --> 47:58.343
I'm sorry, man.
First your mom and now this.

47:58.378 --> 48:00.642
You're on a shitty
roll of luck.

48:00.677 --> 48:04.679
Yeah, I'm on a pretty shitty
roll of luck, Gorka.

48:04.714 --> 48:07.253
Well, I have more bad news.

48:07.288 --> 48:09.750
Your cabin at
the back of my property

48:09.785 --> 48:12.863
is deemed an illegal
additional dwelling unit.

48:12.898 --> 48:15.129
What does that mean?

48:15.164 --> 48:17.692
Well, it means we have
to tear down your little hut.

48:17.727 --> 48:20.761
Oh. Don't do this right now.

48:20.796 --> 48:23.566
Hey, maybe we could pull it
apart and make a bonfire,

48:23.601 --> 48:25.909
like a farewell
to this time of ours.

48:25.944 --> 48:28.912
Maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it's a sign that we have to move on.

48:28.947 --> 48:31.343
I mean, look,
you have a new cabin now.

48:31.378 --> 48:33.543
Why don't you just live there?
You will be fine.

48:33.578 --> 48:37.217
Hey, Gorka, is this, um...

48:37.252 --> 48:38.614
is this because Nora bit you?

48:38.649 --> 48:41.782
No. Not even a little.
No, no.

48:41.817 --> 48:44.224
Because I apologized about that
and it's not going to happen again.

48:44.259 --> 48:45.995
And it was my fault.
She shouldn't have been off-leash.

48:46.030 --> 48:50.098
It's not. I've forgiven
your dog for mauling me.

48:51.827 --> 48:53.398
Uh, all good?

48:53.433 --> 48:55.400
Do you have
anything else to say?

48:55.435 --> 48:58.106
What else is there to say?

48:58.141 --> 49:02.242
Okay. I'm sorry, man.

49:02.277 --> 49:06.015
- Bye.
- Yeah.

49:06.050 --> 49:07.445
Talk soon.

49:14.652 --> 49:15.860
Hmm.

49:22.297 --> 49:25.067
Hey, Gorka.

49:25.102 --> 49:27.630
Dawn, he's out.
Got rid of grandpa.

49:27.665 --> 49:30.666
- Yes! You're the best.
- Okay, bye.

49:33.671 --> 49:36.078
That's on you, 100%.

49:36.113 --> 49:37.673
You bit him
and you fucked us.

49:39.479 --> 49:41.644
You know what people
call a dog that bites?

49:41.679 --> 49:44.614
A biting dog asshole.

49:44.649 --> 49:47.892
And that's how you're acting.

49:57.893 --> 49:59.497
Fuck!

50:28.924 --> 50:30.935
What the fuck?

50:42.146 --> 50:43.706
Sometimes life is messy.

50:43.741 --> 50:44.905
It doesn't go as you planned,

50:44.940 --> 50:47.908
but you can't wallow in that.

50:47.943 --> 50:49.349
There's no time.

50:49.384 --> 50:50.713
You need to suck it up

50:50.748 --> 50:52.484
and pick up the pieces
and rebuild.

50:55.555 --> 50:57.720
It's like your music, Leif.

50:57.755 --> 50:59.920
Your career hasn't gone
exactly as planned,

50:59.955 --> 51:01.966
but it's not over.

51:04.003 --> 51:08.731
Um, how do I say this?

51:08.766 --> 51:13.274
Leif, you just
think too much in your art.

51:13.309 --> 51:15.045
You're so fucking scared
of what people

51:15.080 --> 51:20.050
are going to say or think
and it's killing you.

51:20.085 --> 51:24.153
So this is my request.

51:24.188 --> 51:29.554
I want you to play a song
just for me.

51:29.589 --> 51:31.820
Play it from your heart.

51:31.855 --> 51:34.394
Don't worry about if it's good or
bad or any of that kind of stuff.

51:34.429 --> 51:38.728
Just do it for me because you
fucking love to make music.

51:38.763 --> 51:42.435
I promise I'll be listening.

52:04.019 --> 52:06.426
You know,
I'm a shitty painter. Okay.

52:06.461 --> 52:09.429
But I'm also great
because I paint for myself.

52:09.464 --> 52:11.200
I paint because I love it.

52:14.172 --> 52:15.534
And that's what
you've forgotten.

52:15.569 --> 52:18.999
You forgot that
you love your music.

52:31.717 --> 52:33.453
Yeah, I was just jamming.

52:33.488 --> 52:35.455
It was really fucking awesome.

52:35.490 --> 52:36.819
And it made me think
that I don't need to be

52:36.854 --> 52:38.623
in a band called Restaurant.

52:38.658 --> 52:40.526
What I need to do
is make my own music.

52:40.561 --> 52:42.264
And so I feel really
thankful to Honey.

52:42.299 --> 52:43.628
You know, I never
would have got there, but...

52:43.663 --> 52:44.827
Leif, I'm not going to...

52:44.862 --> 52:46.268
I'm not going to come up.

52:46.303 --> 52:48.336
- What?
- To the cabin.

52:48.371 --> 52:51.306
I'm not going to come.

52:51.341 --> 52:53.473
Why not?
What are you talking about?

52:53.508 --> 52:55.475
I just... I can't do this.

52:55.510 --> 52:58.038
I can't do this with you.
You're not just a hook-up to me.

52:58.073 --> 53:00.040
Oh, come on, Aud.
I could be a hook-up.

53:00.075 --> 53:02.482
I'll be a hook-up this trip.
Just come.

53:02.517 --> 53:06.849
- Shut up, Leif, please.
- Just come. Look, this is a celebration, remember?

53:06.884 --> 53:09.654
- My mother's dead.
- Listen, I like you is the thing.

53:09.689 --> 53:12.393
I like you so much.

53:12.428 --> 53:17.057
I'm going through a brutal
break-up and it's painful.

53:17.092 --> 53:18.762
I don't know,
I don't want to lead you on

53:18.797 --> 53:21.666
and then disappoint you,
which is what would happen.

53:21.701 --> 53:25.274
You know?
So, I'm not going to come up, Leif.

53:25.309 --> 53:26.506
I just... I can't.

53:26.541 --> 53:28.310
Okay.

53:28.345 --> 53:30.675
Okay.

53:30.710 --> 53:32.545
Okay.

53:34.912 --> 53:36.714
Okay, great.

53:40.357 --> 53:41.917
I'm going to go.

53:45.560 --> 53:48.132
Unless you have
anything else to say.

53:50.059 --> 53:51.333
I don't know what else

53:51.368 --> 53:56.701
to, um... to say, Audrey.

53:56.736 --> 53:59.341
Okay.

53:59.376 --> 54:00.342
Yeah, I guess that's it.

54:00.377 --> 54:02.905
I hope that, um...

54:02.940 --> 54:04.907
look, it was really nice to...
I hope you...

54:04.942 --> 54:07.107
Um, I'm going to go, okay?

54:07.142 --> 54:08.350
Okay.

54:10.387 --> 54:11.716
Bye.

54:11.751 --> 54:14.818
Yeah, good, um...
have a great life.

54:18.153 --> 54:19.295
Okay.

54:19.330 --> 54:20.956
Bye.

54:25.600 --> 54:28.601
Mother... fuck.

54:34.609 --> 54:37.412
Nora, come on.
We're going for a walk.

54:37.447 --> 54:40.184
Fine, I'll go alone.

55:39.036 --> 55:40.475
Hey, Nora?

55:42.677 --> 55:44.446
Nora?

55:45.548 --> 55:50.551
Nora? Nora?

55:50.586 --> 55:51.981
Nora!

55:54.557 --> 55:56.788
Come on, girl!
Where are you? Nora!

55:56.823 --> 55:59.087
Nora!

56:00.090 --> 56:01.529
Nora!

56:03.467 --> 56:07.403
Nora! Come here, girl. Nora!

56:07.438 --> 56:10.703
Nora? Nora!

56:10.738 --> 56:14.872
Nora! Come on, girl!

56:17.877 --> 56:18.876
Fuck!

56:29.724 --> 56:30.954
Bridgeport police.

56:30.989 --> 56:32.252
Yeah, I'd like to report
a missing dog,

56:32.287 --> 56:34.221
maybe a stolen dog.

56:34.256 --> 56:36.091
- Hold please.
- Can you please just...

56:38.535 --> 56:42.064
Whew, okay.

56:42.099 --> 56:46.068
- Bridgeport Police.
- Hi, I'd like to... is this the same person?

56:46.103 --> 56:47.707
No, sir,
this is someone else.

56:47.742 --> 56:51.205
I would like to report my...
my dog is missing.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.548
Or stolen. I don't know.
I think stolen.

56:53.583 --> 56:55.715
There's a man in a yellow jacket
who stole my dog, so...

56:55.750 --> 56:58.817
- and I know his address.
- Okay. What's his name, sir?

56:58.852 --> 57:02.150
I do not know his name.
I have not seen his face.

57:02.185 --> 57:03.888
All I know is that he's been
in a yellow jacket,

57:03.923 --> 57:06.286
and I know it's him
because yesterday

57:06.321 --> 57:09.058
I accidentally
broke into his house

57:09.093 --> 57:10.092
and that really
pissed him off.

57:10.127 --> 57:11.533
You broke into his house?

57:11.568 --> 57:13.733
Well, I didn't
technically break in.

57:13.768 --> 57:16.736
My mother gave me the key.
Okay? My mom is dead.

57:16.771 --> 57:19.409
- Okay.
- And she made a list, and I had to do the list.

57:19.444 --> 57:23.303
And on the list I had to break into
this man with the yellow jacket's house

57:23.338 --> 57:25.074
and leave a note
on his bed, okay?

57:25.109 --> 57:27.241
I would like you to send
a patrol car there.

57:27.276 --> 57:30.310
And if the dog is not there, I would
like you to ask him some questions.

57:30.345 --> 57:31.652
Okay. What did you say
his name was?

57:31.687 --> 57:33.918
I don't know
the fucking man's name!

57:33.953 --> 57:35.491
We're going in circles here.

57:35.526 --> 57:38.857
He put two dead rabbits
on my fucking hood!

57:38.892 --> 57:41.321
He stole your
rabbits as well.

57:41.356 --> 57:43.565
He did...
they're not my rabbits!

57:43.600 --> 57:44.995
Sir, I'm going to need you
to calm down.

57:45.030 --> 57:46.502
You know what's
gonna happen, sir?

57:46.537 --> 57:48.966
Is I'm gonna go to
this fucking guy's house.

57:49.001 --> 57:51.133
- Uh, sir?
- And then you're gonna have two dead rabbits,

57:51.168 --> 57:53.135
- a fucking dead dog...
- Watch your language.

57:53.170 --> 57:55.302
...and a fucking dead man
on your hands.

57:57.581 --> 58:00.879
- Hold, please.
- Don't put me on ho... oh!

58:11.386 --> 58:14.156
Nora! Nora!

58:14.191 --> 58:18.028
Hey, if you're in here, man,
I want my dog back!

58:18.063 --> 58:20.030
I'm not fucking around!

58:20.065 --> 58:22.967
Nora!

58:23.002 --> 58:26.806
Nora, I am here. Make a sound
and I'll come get you.

58:26.841 --> 58:28.742
If he's near, I'll kill him.

58:32.880 --> 58:38.246
Okay. "If you have my dog,

58:38.281 --> 58:40.952
no questions asked."

58:40.987 --> 58:44.318
Okay, "If you have my dog..."

58:44.353 --> 58:47.893
"I'm the predator,
not the prey."

58:51.866 --> 58:52.931
Okay.

59:13.525 --> 59:15.426
Nora?

59:22.424 --> 59:23.698
Nora?

1:00:42.977 --> 1:00:44.504
- Hey, fuck boy.
- Aah! Fuck!

1:00:44.539 --> 1:00:46.946
Back! Back! What the fuck
did I ever do to you?

1:00:46.981 --> 1:00:48.948
- What do you want from me?
- I want to slice you open

1:00:48.983 --> 1:00:51.313
and watch your fucking guts
spill out, sugar dick.

1:00:51.348 --> 1:00:53.183
Why are you fucking with me?

1:00:53.218 --> 1:00:54.514
I think you've
got that backwards.

1:00:54.549 --> 1:00:56.516
You're the one
who stole my dog, man.

1:00:56.551 --> 1:00:58.485
If you did, just please give
her back and then this is over.

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:00.729
I don't know anything
about a fucking dog.

1:01:00.764 --> 1:01:02.962
And you're the one that's
been messing with me, okay?

1:01:02.997 --> 1:01:04.700
You fucking broke into
my house first, remember?

1:01:04.735 --> 1:01:06.570
Well, yes, I do. There's
an explanation for that.

1:01:06.605 --> 1:01:09.529
- Oh, please.
- I was doing Honey's list, okay?

1:01:09.564 --> 1:01:12.466
She told me to go in and leave the
note on your pillow. That's it.

1:01:12.501 --> 1:01:15.744
That's how fucking pussy-whipped
you are there, sugar dick?

1:01:15.779 --> 1:01:18.142
You just prance your
sweet cheeks all over town

1:01:18.177 --> 1:01:20.507
doing whatever the hell
she tells you to, fuck boy?

1:01:20.542 --> 1:01:24.984
What the fuck is with your aggressive
compliments, you fucking weirdo, man?

1:01:25.019 --> 1:01:27.657
Just so you know,
that's all you're ever gonna be to her.

1:01:27.692 --> 1:01:29.549
You're just a little fuck toy
and she's gonna chew you up

1:01:29.584 --> 1:01:31.452
and spit you out
when she's done.

1:01:31.487 --> 1:01:33.157
Who is gonna do that to me?

1:01:33.192 --> 1:01:36.292
Don't fucking play dumb
with me, asshole. Honey!

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:40.571
Honey's my mom.

1:01:41.838 --> 1:01:43.673
Like, your actual mother?

1:01:45.567 --> 1:01:48.403
She gave birth to you?
Oh, fuck. You're Leif.

1:01:48.438 --> 1:01:50.746
Oh, fu...

1:01:52.849 --> 1:01:55.014
Dude, that's hilarious.

1:01:55.049 --> 1:01:57.016
So, wait, did she tell you
about our fight, because I...

1:01:57.051 --> 1:01:59.821
because listen, there's
two sides to every story.

1:01:59.856 --> 1:02:01.658
I'm not the bad guy here,
okay?

1:02:01.693 --> 1:02:04.584
I mean, she fucking
stole from me.

1:02:04.619 --> 1:02:07.092
Do you not know about Honey?

1:02:07.127 --> 1:02:09.765
What about Honey?

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:13.296
Honey's dead, man.

1:02:14.332 --> 1:02:15.837
What?

1:02:15.872 --> 1:02:18.367
My mother's, uh...
she passed away.

1:02:18.402 --> 1:02:20.974
That's why I'm here.

1:02:23.946 --> 1:02:25.781
Honey is dead?

1:02:28.247 --> 1:02:29.246
Yes.

1:02:31.954 --> 1:02:33.085
How?

1:02:34.088 --> 1:02:36.055
Cancer, yes.

1:02:38.092 --> 1:02:40.389
Cancer?

1:02:40.424 --> 1:02:41.665
Jesus, Honey.

1:02:44.263 --> 1:02:45.669
I didn't know.

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:50.674
Oh, fuck. She didn't say
anything about being sick.

1:02:53.943 --> 1:02:55.778
Who are you, man?

1:02:57.980 --> 1:02:59.474
I'm Carl.

1:03:01.918 --> 1:03:05.348
We were... your mom and I
were lovers.

1:03:07.726 --> 1:03:10.650
I mean, we were...

1:03:10.685 --> 1:03:15.094
on a break
and I thought she...

1:03:15.129 --> 1:03:18.933
hooked up with some
young dude to, you know,

1:03:18.968 --> 1:03:20.594
just get a little
on the side.

1:03:20.629 --> 1:03:23.872
She used to
do that sometimes.

1:03:23.907 --> 1:03:27.469
Your mom had quite
an appetite.

1:03:27.504 --> 1:03:30.307
Yeah, young guys, threesomes,

1:03:30.342 --> 1:03:32.276
I mean, group sex, whatever.

1:03:32.311 --> 1:03:35.114
Oral, anal,
I mean, she did it all.

1:03:35.149 --> 1:03:39.118
She was a very,
very sexual animal,

1:03:39.153 --> 1:03:41.582
and that's probably not what
her son wants to hear, I guess.

1:03:41.617 --> 1:03:44.519
- Sorry.
- No problem.

1:03:47.359 --> 1:03:51.130
Oh, fuck.

1:03:51.165 --> 1:03:56.905
God, I... I feel like I'm fucking
made out of clay or something here.

1:03:56.940 --> 1:04:00.942
Oh, God.
I might pass out.

1:04:00.977 --> 1:04:05.177
- Could I get a water?
- Yeah, of course. I'll grab you a water.

1:04:34.109 --> 1:04:35.570
You okay?

1:04:41.182 --> 1:04:42.379
Coming.

1:04:49.784 --> 1:04:51.586
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:05:04.007 --> 1:05:05.732
That's a lot of water, man.

1:05:05.767 --> 1:05:07.778
Thanks.

1:05:11.476 --> 1:05:15.016
We had a fight, me and Honey.

1:05:17.416 --> 1:05:19.614
I mean, she stole from me and...

1:05:22.619 --> 1:05:24.894
It seemed so important
at the time.

1:05:26.964 --> 1:05:28.392
God, I got so fucking mad.

1:05:28.427 --> 1:05:33.232
I... I said terrible
things to her.

1:05:34.664 --> 1:05:37.764
I called my dog
a biting asshole

1:05:37.799 --> 1:05:40.437
before she disappeared.

1:05:42.947 --> 1:05:44.441
Well, your mom was...

1:05:44.476 --> 1:05:46.608
I called her
some bad shit, too.

1:05:46.643 --> 1:05:50.051
Called her a fucking
thief and rat.

1:05:50.086 --> 1:05:52.713
Just...

1:05:52.748 --> 1:05:55.419
she really loved you, Leif.

1:05:55.454 --> 1:05:59.819
I mean, it tore her apart

1:05:59.854 --> 1:06:01.458
that she left you.

1:06:01.493 --> 1:06:05.836
That was her
big regret in life.

1:06:07.664 --> 1:06:10.137
And it broke her heart that...

1:06:10.172 --> 1:06:13.140
you didn't want anything to
do with her after you grew up.

1:06:13.175 --> 1:06:18.310
I mean, maybe
she deserved forgiveness.

1:06:20.842 --> 1:06:24.448
People who love each other
should be together.

1:06:24.483 --> 1:06:26.153
That's the bottom line.

1:06:26.188 --> 1:06:30.454
I mean, time together

1:06:30.489 --> 1:06:32.126
is what matters.

1:06:34.933 --> 1:06:36.999
And now it's too late.

1:06:38.893 --> 1:06:42.466
It's too late
for both of us.

1:06:42.501 --> 1:06:43.973
You know?
We fucking blew it.

1:06:44.008 --> 1:06:45.040
Shame on us.

1:06:49.343 --> 1:06:50.870
I can't be here anymore.

1:06:50.905 --> 1:06:53.873
It smells like her here,
you know?

1:06:53.908 --> 1:06:56.777
I can feel her.

1:06:59.914 --> 1:07:01.650
I love you, Honey.

1:07:02.917 --> 1:07:06.094
And I'm gonna miss you.

1:07:08.428 --> 1:07:12.331
Oh, God, I'm gonna miss
your smile and your...

1:07:12.366 --> 1:07:13.530
your eyes.

1:07:18.141 --> 1:07:19.767
Your mind.

1:07:21.276 --> 1:07:23.342
Your sense of humor.

1:07:23.377 --> 1:07:26.444
The taste of your vagina
in the morning.

1:07:28.943 --> 1:07:30.217
I'm gonna miss all of it.

1:07:32.947 --> 1:07:34.551
I'm gonna miss you,
sweet girl.

1:07:38.161 --> 1:07:40.920
I'll miss you every day...

1:07:40.955 --> 1:07:43.593
for the rest of my days.

1:07:49.568 --> 1:07:51.403
Well...

1:07:56.971 --> 1:07:58.575
I'll get out of your hair.

1:08:00.447 --> 1:08:02.546
If you decide to stick around,

1:08:02.581 --> 1:08:07.386
um, you know, you can come by
my place any time you want.

1:08:07.421 --> 1:08:10.752
We could, I don't know,

1:08:10.787 --> 1:08:13.953
go fishing or something.

1:08:13.988 --> 1:08:15.790
Tell you a lot of stories
about your mom.

1:08:15.825 --> 1:08:18.001
That'd be great.

1:08:19.664 --> 1:08:23.303
I'll keep an eye open
for your dog, too.

1:08:23.338 --> 1:08:27.010
That'd be amazing
if something happened with that.

1:08:27.045 --> 1:08:30.805
Dogs have a way of reappearing
on this mountain.

1:08:32.446 --> 1:08:33.808
I hope so.

1:09:01.904 --> 1:09:03.310
Nora?

1:09:06.546 --> 1:09:09.448
Nora?

1:09:09.483 --> 1:09:10.845
Come on, girl.

1:09:27.303 --> 1:09:28.863
Nora?

1:09:49.226 --> 1:09:50.918
This is the last one,

1:09:50.953 --> 1:09:55.791
and then we're done.

1:09:57.894 --> 1:10:00.400
It's called Green Lake.

1:10:00.435 --> 1:10:03.062
It is my favorite spot.

1:10:03.097 --> 1:10:05.900
It is so beautiful it hurts.

1:10:09.103 --> 1:10:10.872
I'm gonna miss it.

1:10:10.907 --> 1:10:13.072
Anyway,
you're gonna hike there,

1:10:13.107 --> 1:10:15.316
and it's not an easy hike,

1:10:15.351 --> 1:10:18.517
so make sure you have on
good shoes.

1:10:18.552 --> 1:10:20.321
There's a red backpack
in the garage

1:10:20.356 --> 1:10:22.455
labeled "Green Lake."

1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:25.953
Now there's
some supplies in there

1:10:25.988 --> 1:10:27.889
and there's a map
in the front compartment.

1:10:27.924 --> 1:10:31.530
You'll need that, definitely.
Don't open anything else.

1:10:31.565 --> 1:10:35.105
Just get the map
and follow the instructions.

1:10:55.325 --> 1:10:58.117
Enjoy the hike.
I took it many times.

1:10:58.152 --> 1:11:02.330
Countless times.
And I always thought of you.

1:11:02.365 --> 1:11:06.829
When I was missing you,
I went here.

1:11:22.616 --> 1:11:24.253
I always hoped
you'd call me back

1:11:24.288 --> 1:11:26.387
and we'd come to this lake
together one day.

1:11:30.987 --> 1:11:33.856
It's marked on the map.
You can't miss it.

1:11:49.170 --> 1:11:50.213
Yeah.

1:12:04.592 --> 1:12:06.020
I made it.

1:12:08.596 --> 1:12:10.662
It's really not
that green though.

1:12:10.697 --> 1:12:15.403
Now, under the big tree
you'll find a box.

1:12:15.438 --> 1:12:17.537
It's my ashes.

1:12:45.061 --> 1:12:49.404
Once you find it,
read the letter that's in the backpack.

1:12:50.704 --> 1:12:54.167
All right.

1:12:54.202 --> 1:12:59.238
"My name is Leif.
My mother loved me.

1:12:59.273 --> 1:13:02.681
I wish she was different
than who she was.

1:13:02.716 --> 1:13:05.145
I hated that she left me,

1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:06.850
and I was never willing

1:13:06.885 --> 1:13:09.358
to listen to anything
she had to say

1:13:09.393 --> 1:13:11.855
because I thought
she was a kook,

1:13:11.890 --> 1:13:14.858
and maybe she was.

1:13:14.893 --> 1:13:17.256
But now my mother is dead,

1:13:17.291 --> 1:13:20.468
and I am at a lake
with no mother,

1:13:20.503 --> 1:13:25.066
and she wants me
to say these words.

1:13:25.101 --> 1:13:28.069
'I love you, Mom.

1:13:28.104 --> 1:13:30.511
I forgive you.

1:13:30.546 --> 1:13:32.711
It's time for me to move on
with my life

1:13:32.746 --> 1:13:35.076
and be successful.

1:13:35.111 --> 1:13:38.915
I will be dead soon.
So will everyone.

1:13:38.950 --> 1:13:43.282
So will the planet if those
motherfuckers in government

1:13:43.317 --> 1:13:46.120
don't start taking
global warming seriously.

1:13:46.155 --> 1:13:49.123
Fucking pricks!
Money whores.'"

1:13:54.768 --> 1:13:56.900
That's great.

1:13:56.935 --> 1:13:59.738
"Now eulogize me
in your own words

1:13:59.773 --> 1:14:02.444
and scatter my ashes.
Don't spill me."

1:14:07.781 --> 1:14:10.518
I wish I had something
great to say, Honey,

1:14:10.553 --> 1:14:14.115
and I had a lot of feelings.

1:14:14.150 --> 1:14:19.087
But I think my biggest regret is that
we didn't spend any time together.

1:14:19.122 --> 1:14:20.924
I just don't know you
and you don't...

1:14:20.959 --> 1:14:21.958
Heya!

1:14:24.501 --> 1:14:25.599
Hi.

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:28.371
Beautiful spot.

1:14:29.803 --> 1:14:33.134
Yeah, it's...
it was my mother's favorite.

1:14:34.973 --> 1:14:37.941
- Okay. Bye now.
- Okay.

1:14:37.976 --> 1:14:39.173
Bye now.

1:14:44.950 --> 1:14:47.148
What the fuck?

1:14:47.183 --> 1:14:48.820
Rest in peace, Honey.

1:15:00.031 --> 1:15:01.030
Okay.

1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:06.541
Whoa.

1:15:06.576 --> 1:15:07.575
All right.

1:16:31.595 --> 1:16:32.957
Aah!

1:16:52.143 --> 1:16:54.044
Oh, shit.

1:18:14.390 --> 1:18:17.358
Okay, you learned
what I needed to teach you.

1:18:17.393 --> 1:18:19.558
You let out your emotions,

1:18:19.593 --> 1:18:22.165
you rekindled your love,

1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:24.904
and you became the predator.

1:18:24.939 --> 1:18:29.370
Those lessons are what I learned to
be most important on this planet.

1:18:29.405 --> 1:18:33.473
So now,
you've learned it from me.

1:18:33.508 --> 1:18:36.542
And, yeah, okay, they're
from the Habata trinity

1:18:36.577 --> 1:18:38.082
and I know you hate
that shit,

1:18:38.117 --> 1:18:39.578
but I did get some good
out of those years

1:18:39.613 --> 1:18:41.184
before they fucked me over.

1:18:41.219 --> 1:18:43.186
And anyway,
it's too expensive to sue,

1:18:43.221 --> 1:18:45.056
so, yeah, that's that.

1:18:47.291 --> 1:18:51.194
Now, obviously I have no way to
prove you did the list or not.

1:18:51.229 --> 1:18:54.329
There's no lie detector
or anything insane like that.

1:18:54.364 --> 1:18:57.431
But I do hope you did it, Leif,
because it's meant to help.

1:18:59.842 --> 1:19:02.601
I want for you to experience
the best of this life, Leif.

1:19:02.636 --> 1:19:04.944
That's all I ever wanted.

1:19:04.979 --> 1:19:07.683
And most importantly,

1:19:07.718 --> 1:19:11.577
to feel everything
along the way.

1:19:26.264 --> 1:19:27.626
Nora!

1:19:27.661 --> 1:19:29.903
Oh!

1:19:32.666 --> 1:19:36.239
Oh. Oh.

1:19:43.677 --> 1:19:46.612
I'm sorry
I said that about you.

1:20:08.504 --> 1:20:10.273
You did it, kid.

1:20:10.308 --> 1:20:14.948
Whoa! You finished the list.
The cabin is all yours.

1:20:14.983 --> 1:20:18.919
Or maybe you didn't and then I've
just been wasting my fucking time.

1:20:18.954 --> 1:20:22.450
But if you did,
I'm so proud of you.

1:20:22.485 --> 1:20:24.287
I hope you had a fun time.

1:20:24.322 --> 1:20:26.454
It means a lot to me.

1:20:26.489 --> 1:20:29.292
By the way, those were not
my real ashes, of course.

1:20:29.327 --> 1:20:31.690
When you think about it,
it's not logical, right?

1:20:31.725 --> 1:20:34.495
I mean, I hid the backpack.
I hid the box.

1:20:34.530 --> 1:20:36.497
And also,
I do not weigh 50 pounds,

1:20:36.532 --> 1:20:38.136
and there were not enough
ashes in that.

1:20:38.171 --> 1:20:40.809
But then you probably
figured that out

1:20:40.844 --> 1:20:42.305
because you're such
a little smarty pants.

1:20:42.340 --> 1:20:44.307
Sadly, I didn't.

1:20:44.342 --> 1:20:47.145
Now this last bit
is important.

1:20:49.347 --> 1:20:51.545
You have to move on
with your life.

1:20:52.746 --> 1:20:54.548
What happened to you

1:20:54.583 --> 1:20:57.320
is not what's
happening to you.

1:20:57.355 --> 1:21:00.059
Your past does not dictate
your future.

1:21:01.557 --> 1:21:04.162
Life is so short.

1:21:04.197 --> 1:21:06.967
Try having some more fun.

1:21:07.002 --> 1:21:08.529
And be kind.

1:21:11.204 --> 1:21:16.405
I love you
with all my heart.

1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:19.573
I'm so sorry that I wasn't
better at showing that to you.

1:21:19.608 --> 1:21:24.215
I fucked up.
I just fucked up and it was my fault.

1:21:25.779 --> 1:21:28.054
I know it.

1:21:28.089 --> 1:21:29.583
I'm sorry.

1:21:32.687 --> 1:21:36.964
Now, I'm hoping
and I believe

1:21:36.999 --> 1:21:41.463
that we will be reunited
again in some dimension.

1:21:41.498 --> 1:21:44.202
- Oh, man.
- I know you don't believe that,

1:21:44.237 --> 1:21:46.809
but you're gonna feel
so stupid when it happens.

1:21:49.077 --> 1:21:51.671
And then,

1:21:51.706 --> 1:21:53.013
maybe we can spend
the time together

1:21:53.048 --> 1:21:57.050
that we didn't in this life.

1:21:58.416 --> 1:22:00.053
I would like that.

1:22:05.456 --> 1:22:09.227
So...

1:22:09.262 --> 1:22:11.064
until then.

1:23:10.719 --> 1:23:12.895
This is a terrible painting.

1:23:16.230 --> 1:23:18.494
And an even worse title.

1:23:25.503 --> 1:23:29.472
I'm gonna miss you, Mom.

1:23:29.507 --> 1:23:31.342
That's for sure.
