WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:07.675
Aria: DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT THESE VIDEOS ARE?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.810
IAN'S BEEN WATCHING US
FOR YEARS.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.412
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
 ABOUT US, TOBY.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.781
WE'RE NOT REALLY RELATED.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.449
Jenna: ALISON'S
 SO CUNNING.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.386
IF THIS VIDEO GETS OUT,
WE WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.156
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.230
HI, I'M JACKIE MOLINA.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.633
IS THIS
THE MONTGOMERY HOUSE?
EXCUSE ME.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.636
Ezra: SHE WAS THE FIRST
 REALLY SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND
 I EVER HAD.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.139
NOT TELLING ME ABOUT HER
WAS A LIE.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.440
I'M SORRY.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.409
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.443
NOT THE WHOLE TIME.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.378
DON'T TOUCH ME.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.248
MAKE SURE SHE
GETS THIS.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.718
THEY EXTENDED
YOUR DAD'S ASSIGNMENT.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.086
HE WANTS US TO COME TO TEXAS.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.387
YOU MEAN
FOR A VISIT?

00:53.421 --> 00:54.255
FOR A YEAR.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.792
LOOK, I'VE NEVER HAD
A SAFE PLACE TO LAND,

00:58.826 --> 01:00.461
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE I DO.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.697
MELISSA WOULD WANT ME
 TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.234
GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME
LIKE YOU TOOK CARE
OF ALISON?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.102
WELL, IS THAT WHY
YOU KILLED HER,

01:08.136 --> 01:10.571
'CAUSE SHE FOUND
YOUR HOME MOVIES?

01:10.604 --> 01:12.573
( screaming )

01:12.606 --> 01:15.676
PLEASE. IF YOU LOVE MY SISTER,
YOU WON'T DO THIS.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.679
I'M DOING IT
 BECAUSE I LOVE HER.

01:18.712 --> 01:19.847
AAH!

01:19.880 --> 01:23.151
LET GO OF ME!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.553
AAH!

01:25.586 --> 01:27.621
( bell tolling )

01:27.655 --> 01:31.525
Cop: IS THIS SOME KIND
OF A JOKE?

01:31.559 --> 01:32.693
THERE'S NOBODY IN THERE.

01:34.762 --> 01:40.568
"SLEEP TIGHT WHILE YOU
STILL CAN, BITCHES. - 'A.'"

01:47.808 --> 01:51.279
Aria: HE WASN'T MOVING,
OKAY, AND HE WAS
NOT BREATHING.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.680
BECAUSE HE WAS DEAD.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.914
IS DEAD.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.716
NOT WAS, IS.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.485
SO, UNLESS WE'RE SAYING
IAN'S A ZOMBIE,

01:57.518 --> 01:59.153
SOMEONE MOVED THE BODY.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.689
IT WAS PROBABLY STUFFED
 IN THE TRUNK OF "A's" CAR.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.824
IT'S PROBABLY ON ITS WAY
TO A MEAT GRINDER.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.261
OH, EM, COME ON,
YOU GOTTA QUIT WATCHING
THOSE HORROR FILMS.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.798
YOU GUYS, "A's" PROBABLY
WATCHING US RIGHT NOW.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.633
ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE
COULD BE "A."

02:15.503 --> 02:17.271
HALF THE TOWN IS HERE!

02:17.305 --> 02:19.907
THEY WANT TO SEE
YOU GIRLS DOWN
AT THE STATION.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.375
I'M HERE TO DRIVE YOU.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.278
UH, WELL, I SAW
MY PARENTS EARLIER.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.380
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT
TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.682
THEY'LL MEET US THERE.
COME ON.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.751
LET'S GO.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.671
HEY, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO THE POLICE STATION.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.379
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

02:58.412 --> 03:00.648
GARRETT...
LET'S GO.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.915
NO, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.851
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.434
IT'S NOT SAFE
TO TALK IN THE CAR.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.636
IT DOESN'T REALLY FEEL
SAFE OUT HERE, EITHER.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.372
LOOK, I'M SORRY
IF I SCARED YOU,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.507
BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS
YOU GUYS NEED TO KNOW

03:26.540 --> 03:28.609
BEFORE YOU START
ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.611
ALL RIGHT, THE POLICE
CANNOT KNOW

03:30.644 --> 03:33.013
THAT YOU WERE
BLACKMAILING IAN,
AND THAT I WAS HELPING YOU.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.648
IT'S A SERIOUS CRIME.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.417
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE MESSENGER?

03:36.450 --> 03:37.651
HE DOESN'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.786
AND THE MONEY?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.821
FOR NOW, I'M HIDING IT.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.989
WHAT ABOUT
THE VIDEOS?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.624
YOU STILL HAVE THEM?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.462
YEAH, WE MADE A COPY.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.598
OKAY, LOOK, I'VE NEVER ASKED
YOU GUYS HOW YOU GOT THEM,

03:50.631 --> 03:52.400
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.002
BUT YOU'D BETTER BE PREPARED
TO TELL THE POLICE HOW YOU DID,

03:55.035 --> 03:57.305
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE FIRST QUESTION
THEY'RE GONNA ASK YOU.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.473
OFFICER REYNOLDS,
 WHAT'S YOUR ETA?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.775
UH, YEAH, WE'RE EN ROUTE.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.512
ROGER THAT.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.515
I HATE ASKING YOU
TO LIE LIKE THIS,

04:07.548 --> 04:09.483
BUT ARE WE ALL CLEAR?

04:09.517 --> 04:11.885
WE'LL KEEP
THE VIDEOS
A SECRET.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.987
FOR NOW.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.623
OKAY, GOOD.
LET'S GET BACK.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.993
I'M SORRY WE
GOT YOU INTO THIS.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.595
WELL, WE'LL BE OKAY.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.564
WE JUST NEED TO STICK
TO OUR STORY, YEAH?

04:36.644 --> 04:37.778
The Pierces:
 * GOT A SECRET

04:37.811 --> 04:39.413
* CAN YOU KEEP IT?

04:39.447 --> 04:41.415
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE

04:41.449 --> 04:43.651
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:43.684 --> 04:46.454
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:46.487 --> 04:48.622
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:48.656 --> 04:51.859
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:51.892 --> 04:53.994
* 'CAUSE TWO
 CAN KEEP A SECRET *

04:54.027 --> 04:56.196
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

05:00.468 --> 05:03.537
Spencer: I DON'T THINK
I'D BE HERE IF IT
WASN'T FOR "A."

05:03.571 --> 05:06.707
"A" KILLED IAN
TO KEEP YOU HERE.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.876
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT
IS NOT A COMFORTING THOUGHT.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.944
"A" GIVES SO SHE CAN TAKE.
WE KNOW THAT.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.046
SO WHAT'S THE BITCH
GONNA ASK FOR?

05:13.080 --> 05:16.450
WHATEVER IT IS,
I DON'T THINK
WE CAN AFFORD IT.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.986
SPENCE, YOU DIDN'T...

05:19.019 --> 05:20.754
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING?

05:20.788 --> 05:24.625
I SAW A BLACK HOODIE,
BLACK BOOTS, AND GLOVES.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.429
WELL, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THAT "A's" NOT JENNA.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.697
ARE WE SURE?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.865
"A" SEES
EVERYTHING, HANNA.

05:31.899 --> 05:35.469
I'M STARTING TO THINK
WE SHOULD TELL SOMEONE
ABOUT HER-- HIM-- IT.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.838
WHAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.541
"A" KNOWS ALL
OF OUR SECRETS.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.009
IF PEOPLE FIND OUT,
WE'LL ALWAYS BE

05:42.042 --> 05:43.844
"THOSE GIRLS WHO BLINDED
JENNA MARSHALL."

05:43.877 --> 05:46.480
AND NOW WE'RE "THOSE GIRLS
WHO ARE AFRAID OF 'A.'"

05:46.514 --> 05:49.082
NO, EM, I MEAN,
 YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT...

05:49.116 --> 05:51.819
LOOK, WE HAVE
 SO MUCH TO LOSE.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.454
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A HANGOVER,

05:53.487 --> 05:54.922
AND I NEVER WENT
TO THE PARTY.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.458
WE NEED CAFFEINE.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.661
OH! NO OFFENSE,
BUT CAN I MAKE IT?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.763
SERIOUSLY?
I'M WITH ARIA.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.164
YEAH. SORRY, SPENCE,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.966
BUT YOUR COFFEE
GIVES ME THE SHAKES.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.472
AMATEURS.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.747
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.383
MOM?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.120
VERONICA, SINCE THIS
IS YOUR IDEA...

06:27.154 --> 06:30.023
THE ACCUSATIONS
YOU MADE ABOUT IAN

06:30.057 --> 06:33.461
HAVE CAST A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT
ON ALL OF YOU.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.862
SPENCER IS STILL
A PERSON OF INTEREST

06:34.895 --> 06:36.464
IN ALISON'S
MURDER INVESTIGATION,

06:36.497 --> 06:37.998
AND NOW THE POLICE
SEEM TO THINK

06:38.031 --> 06:39.500
THAT YOU THREE
ARE ALSO INVOLVED.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.535
IAN KILLED
ALISON, OKAY,

06:41.569 --> 06:43.904
AND LAST NIGHT,
HE TRIED TO KILL ME.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.507
WE WERE ALL THERE.
WE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.041
AND WE HEARD YOU.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.811
WE DON'T NEED TO REHASH
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.446
THIS IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.047
WHILE THE POLICE
SORT THROUGH THIS,

06:54.081 --> 06:55.983
WE WANT YOU GIRLS
TO SEE A GRIEF COUNSELOR.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.952
A THERAPIST WHO CAN HELP YOU
DEAL WITH ALISON'S DEATH...

06:58.986 --> 07:00.854
AND WHAT APPEARS
TO THE POLICE

07:00.888 --> 07:03.757
TO BE AN OBSESSION
WITH TRYING TO PIN
HER DEATH ON IAN.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.726
YOU THINK WE'RE LYING?

07:05.759 --> 07:08.729
EMILY, I BELIEVE YOU,
 BUT IT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS
 THAT CONCERNS US.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.498
THIS IS A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE,

07:10.531 --> 07:13.534
AND THE GOAL IS TO GARNER
BOTH POLICE AND PUBLIC SYMPATHY.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.869
I'M NOT GOING
TO A SHRINK. THAT'S
WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.071
YOU CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T GO.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.040
MAYBE YOU'LL GET MORE
 OUT OF IT THAN YOU THINK.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.108
THIS IS BULL--
HANNA!

07:23.644 --> 07:25.245
DO YOU BELIEVE US?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.948
WHAT I KNOW IS
THAT ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
IS IN THE HOSPITAL,

07:27.981 --> 07:29.783
AND THE OTHER ONE'S
IN TROUBLE,

07:29.817 --> 07:31.652
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO PROTECT YOU BOTH.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.021
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

07:39.059 --> 07:43.030
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM IAN
FOR A REASON. HE'S DEAD.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.098
DEAD MEN DON'T GET UP
AND WALK AWAY.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.635
WE TOLD YOU, SOMEONE
MOVED THE BODY!

07:47.668 --> 07:49.670
WHO WOULD DO THAT?
AND WHY?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.905
( knocking )

07:56.677 --> 07:57.778
IS SPENCER HOME?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.513
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE, TOBY.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.649
IS SHE OKAY?
NO, SHE ISN'T.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.184
SPENCER'S IN A LOT OF TROUBLE,
AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING HER.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.820
LOOK, WHETHER YOU'VE
EARNED IT OR NOT,
YOU HAVE A REPUTATION.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.922
MY DAUGHTER CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE SEEN WITH YOU.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.091
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO HURT SPENCER.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.895
GOOD. IF YOU MEAN THAT,
YOU'LL STAY AWAY FROM HER.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.502
I'M SORRY, SPENCER.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.254
WHY WOULD JASON MOVE
BACK INTO THAT HOUSE?

08:41.288 --> 08:44.324
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS HIM?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.060
MAYBE HE'S LOOKING FOR--

08:47.094 --> 08:50.898
DON'T. SHH.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.269
IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT
ABOUT THE JASON THING...

08:56.303 --> 08:59.306
YOU WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.785
I MEAN, YOU CAN STAY
HOME FOR ANOTHER DAY.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.221
YEAH?
THAT'D BE
YOUR HOME OR MINE?

09:15.823 --> 09:17.691
WE HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TALK,

09:17.725 --> 09:20.728
BUT, UM, I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME

09:20.761 --> 09:22.730
ABOUT YOUR DAD...

09:22.763 --> 09:24.131
( sighs )

09:24.164 --> 09:27.300
MOM... I'M SO SORRY.

09:27.334 --> 09:31.038
I-- YOU DIDN'T
REALLY DESERVE THAT.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.641
WELL, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE I DID.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.176
YOU SAID EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED TO HEAR,

09:36.209 --> 09:38.912
AND, UM,
YOUR DAD AND I WANTED

09:38.946 --> 09:40.914
TO TELL YOU AND MIKE
THIS TONIGHT,

09:40.948 --> 09:43.350
BUT I THINK YOU COULD
USE SOME GOOD NEWS.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.318
I'M GOING TO MOVE BACK IN.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.890
Y-YOU'RE NOT JUST DOING
THIS FOR ME, RIGHT?

09:49.923 --> 09:54.261
NO. I-I MEAN, I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID NO, BUT...

09:54.294 --> 09:57.064
I'M GOING IT FOR ME, TOO.
I'M READY TO COME HOME.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.871
( chatter )

10:03.904 --> 10:05.238
( chatter quiets )

10:09.710 --> 10:11.311
( giggling )

10:11.344 --> 10:14.982
( period bell rings )

10:35.836 --> 10:37.170
( door opens )

10:37.204 --> 10:39.740
YOU NEED SOME HELP
WITH THAT, MR. FITZ?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.341
( gasping )

10:45.946 --> 10:47.180
YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR SEAT, MR. KAHN.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.452
Boy: WHAT'S UP, NOEL?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.354
HEY, SUSPENSION OVER?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.930
MISS ME?

11:04.932 --> 11:07.801
I THINK THEY MADE
THE WHOLE THING UP
TO GET ATTENTION.

11:07.835 --> 11:11.271
I HEARD IAN AND SPENCER
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.140
( chatter continues )

11:13.173 --> 11:15.943
YOU MEAN THAT HE
FELL TO HIS DEATH
AND THEN DISAPPEARED?

11:15.976 --> 11:19.146
THEY JUST GOT USED
TO EVERYONE LOOKING
AT THEM AFTER ALI DIED.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.081
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S MORE PATHETIC...

11:21.114 --> 11:24.417
PEOPLE WHO GOSSIP,
OR PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO GOSSIP.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.791
( scoffs ) LOOK AT SUZY LIPTON

11:30.824 --> 11:33.426
STRUTTING HER BONY ASS
IN THOSE SKINNY JEANS.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.096
I HEARD SHE LOST ALL THAT WEIGHT
DRINKING RICE MILK.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.932
WHAT?
MILK... YOU CAN BUY
IT ONLINE.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.735
( chuckles )

11:41.769 --> 11:43.871
I MISS HOW EASY
THINGS USED TO BE.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.273
YOU MEAN, BEFORE YOU
REUNITED WITH THE OTHERS?

11:46.306 --> 11:49.142
WE HAD SO MUCH FUN
LAST SUMMER.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.411
AND SOME OF IT
WAS EVEN LEGAL.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.982
( sighs ) I'M TIRED
OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.917
( sighs ) ME TOO.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.853
MAYBE I DO NEED THERAPY...

11:59.887 --> 12:01.922
AS IN RETAIL.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.891
( chuckles )

12:03.924 --> 12:06.827
I STILL DON'T TRUST HIM.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.196
HOW DOES NOEL KAHN
GET SUSPENDED,

12:09.229 --> 12:12.499
AND THEN COME BACK
MORE POPULAR THAN HE WAS
WHEN HE LEFT?

12:12.532 --> 12:15.903
MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT WINNING SMILE.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.240
ARIA. CAN I SEE YOU
A MINUTE?

12:20.273 --> 12:23.276
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU
ABOUT YOUR ESSAY.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.812
You don't have to go.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.949
I'll see you
in a minute.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.958
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:37.991 --> 12:40.227
YEAH. I'M FINE.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.330
D-DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
YOU WANNA TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.933
UH, NOT REALLY.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.068
ARIA, DON'T SHUT ME OUT.
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.503
I'M NOT SHUTTING YOU OUT.
I JUST...

12:50.537 --> 12:52.906
DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IT.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.110
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL
YOU ABOUT JACKIE,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.847
AND I UNDERSTAND
HOW IT LOOKS, BUT YOU'LL SEE--

12:59.880 --> 13:02.149
SHE DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.917
COME OVER LATER.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.221
( sighs )
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.422
ARIA, PLEASE TALK TO ME.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.992
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.929
THINGS JUST
FEEL DIFFERENT.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.065
BUT THEY'RE NOT DIFFERENT.
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.432
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.836
I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.172
ARE-- ARE WE OVER?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.210
I DON'T KNOW.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.090
HI.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.894
UM, IS TOBY HERE?

14:20.928 --> 14:23.030
MY PARENTS WOULD LIKE
YOU TO LEAVE.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.898
HE'S NOT ALLOWED
TO SEE YOU ANYMORE,

14:24.932 --> 14:28.936
SO WHATEVER YOU
HAD WITH HIM... IT'S OVER.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.870
WAIT. JENNA--

14:37.310 --> 14:41.414
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
 WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, HUH?

14:43.450 --> 14:46.486
BE SO EASY FOR ME TO CONVINCE
 YOUR DADDY AND MY MOMMY

14:46.519 --> 14:49.889
THAT YOU'VE BEEN FORCING
 YOURSELF ON ME.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.994
( gasps )

14:54.027 --> 14:56.163
OH, NO, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.330
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:57.364 --> 15:00.067
UM, EMILY,
THIS IS MR. MENDEZ,

15:00.100 --> 15:02.635
AND HE'S THE REALTOR WHO'S GOING
TO BE SHOWING THE HOUSE.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.704
MIND IF I TAKE
A QUICK LOOK AT YOUR ROOM?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.439
I GUESS.
AH.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.275
WELL, I LIKE YOUR PHOTOS,

15:08.308 --> 15:10.377
BUT FOR THE SHOWINGS
YOU SHOULD PUT THEM AWAY.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.346
RENTERS LIKE TO IMAGINE
THEIR OWN STUFF IN THE HOUSE.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.149
NICE. SMALL, BUT GENEROUS
FOR A GUEST BEDROOM.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.551
( chuckles )

15:18.585 --> 15:20.587
OF COURSE, YOU'LL NEED
TO PAINT OVER THIS.

15:22.189 --> 15:25.292
AW... CUTE.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.294
YOU THOUGHT OF LEASING
THE HOME FURNISHED?

15:41.141 --> 15:43.210
( beep )

15:43.243 --> 15:44.978
THAT WAS IAN'S AUNT.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.746
IF SHE HEARS ANYTHING,
SHE'LL CALL.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.648
ANY SIBLINGS?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.418
NO, HIS PARENTS
ARE GONE, AND HE'S
AN ONLY CHILD.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.986
WOULD HE HAVE GONE
TO SEE A FRIEND?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.287
WE CONTACTED EVERYONE.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.123
WE FIGURED HE WAS
IN AN ACCIDENT.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.091
WE'VE CONTACTED EVERY HOSPITAL
IN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.027
HE HASN'T BEEN
TREATED FOR ANYTHING.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.662
HONEY, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
 HE'S NOT HURT.
MOM, WHERE IS HE?

16:02.695 --> 16:04.497
MELISSA.

16:06.499 --> 16:09.402
HEY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.240
WE'VE ISSUED
 AN APB ON IAN'S VEHICLE,

16:13.273 --> 16:15.242
AND WE'RE TRACKING
 HIS CREDIT CARDS,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.677
SO THE SECOND WE
 FIND OUT ANYTHING,
 YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.713
THANK YOU, OFFICER.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.749
OH, UH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.786
WE FOUND THIS IN THE CHURCH.
MY PHONE.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.555
THANK YOU.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.558
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.494
( Melissa crying )

16:34.527 --> 16:36.796
HEY, LISTEN.
AS YOU CAN SEE,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.066
MY DAUGHTER'S
IN A VERY FRAGILE STATE.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.433
SHE'S EXTREMELY WORRIED.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.102
MR. HASTINGS,
FINDING YOUR SON-IN-LAW

16:42.135 --> 16:44.304
IS A TOP PRIORITY
FOR THE ROSEWOOD P.D.

16:47.774 --> 16:51.244
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
BUT WHAT I SAID WAS THE TRUTH.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.080
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS,

16:53.113 --> 16:55.415
BUT WHEN IAN COMES HOME,
WE'RE LEAVING THIS PLACE,

16:55.448 --> 16:58.185
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS BABY!

16:58.218 --> 17:00.787
HE'S NOT COMING HOME,
MELISSA, EVER.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.089
SPENCER!

17:02.122 --> 17:04.223
IF I'M LYING, WHERE IS HE?

17:04.257 --> 17:06.292
HUH? WHY ISN'T HE HERE?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.361
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING
 TO FIGURE OUT,

17:08.395 --> 17:10.663
AND RIGHT NOW, SPENCER, YOU'RE
 JUST COMPLICATING THINGS.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.434
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT
ONE THING YESTERDAY.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.670
YOU DO HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS,
BUT YOU'RE ONLY PROTECTING ONE.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.440
I GUESS THE OTHER ONE'S
JUST A COMPLICATION.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.529
( door opens )

17:46.666 --> 17:49.702
SORRY I'M LATE,
BUT HAVE YOU BEEN DOWNTOWN?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.538
THE SALES ARE HUGE!

17:51.571 --> 17:55.342
YOU MUST BE HANNA.
I'M ANNE.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.810
SO, WHAT'D I MISS?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.179
NOT A THING.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.313
WE WAITED
FOR YOU.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.516
DAMN.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.187
THANKS FOR SPRINGING
FOR THE HOTEL.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.356
TECHNICALLY, I THINK
IT WAS A MOTEL.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.164
I OWE YOU FOR THIS.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.166
NO, YOU DON'T OWE
ME ANYTHING.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.302
HEY, CALEB.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.639
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU DID TO HANNA,

18:26.673 --> 18:30.477
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS,
DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.224
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CREDIT
ALISON FOR THE FRIENDSHIP.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.892
WE BECAME FRIENDS
BECAUSE OF HER.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.795
BUT SHE'S GONE, AND THE FOUR
OF YOU STILL SEEM VERY CLOSE.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.699
WE WEREN'T ALWAYS.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.507
WE LOST TOUCH
WHEN ALI WENT MISSING.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.409
WHAT BROUGHT
YOU BACK TOGETHER?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.313
YOU DON'T ALL
HAVE TO AGREE.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.515
THERE ARE NO RIGHT
OR WRONG ANSWERS HERE.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.884
HER DEATH.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.221
SHE MEANS WHEN THEY--
WHEN THEY FOUND HER.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.588
WHEN THEY
FOUND HER BODY.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.957
DO YOU THINK YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR CLOSURE?

19:17.990 --> 19:21.628
WE WERE... LOOKING
FOR ANSWERS.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.897
THE ANSWER
TO WHO MURDERED ALISON.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.435
THE FOUR OF YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.938
THIS IS A SAFE PLACE TO TALK.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.674
NOTHING YOU SAY HERE
GOES BEYOND THESE WALLS.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.649
DO WE--?

19:45.585 --> 19:47.687
DO WE WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT THING?

19:53.526 --> 19:57.897
( cell phones dinging
and ringing )

20:01.033 --> 20:03.002
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.505
UM, I THINK
OUR TIME IS UP.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.376
OH, IT'S NOT "A."
IT'S JUST MY MOM.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.614
YEAH, SAME HERE.
SHE WANTS ME TO COME HOME.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.563
"WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?"

20:35.935 --> 20:39.772
THEY FOUND IAN'S CAR
BY THE TRAIN STATION

20:39.806 --> 20:42.442
AND $10,000 THAT HE TOOK
FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.312
THEY THINK HE SKIPPED TOWN
AND WE MADE UP A STORY

20:45.345 --> 20:48.515
BECAUSE WE KNEW HE LEFT?

20:48.548 --> 20:51.418
( cell phones dinging
and ringing )

20:53.820 --> 20:57.490
"I SPY A LIAR. - 'A.'"

21:02.929 --> 21:04.897
OKAY, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

21:04.931 --> 21:08.468
BUT WHEN I TELL YOU
HOW MUCH MONEY I SAVED,
YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY,

21:08.501 --> 21:12.038
AND I'LL SHARE THE MADDENS WITH
YOU IF I CAN WEAR THEM FIRST.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.506
HANNA.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.074
OKAY, FINE, YOU CAN HAVE
THE MADDENS,

21:15.107 --> 21:17.644
AND I'LL JUST TAKE
THE BETSEY JOHNSONS.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.949
HI.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.519
HI.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.758
I'M GOING TO EXCUSE MYSELF
AND GO TRY ON MY NEW SHOES.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.097
YOU OKAY?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.066
YEAH. FINE.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.907
DO YOU WANT
TO SIT DOWN, OR...

21:47.940 --> 21:49.476
NO.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.716
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO DO THAT.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.418
WHAT?

21:58.451 --> 22:01.053
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.361
AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO DO THAT, EITHER.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.568
I DIDN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.471
WAS I UNCONSCIOUS
DURING THAT EXCHANGE?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.943
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
IN PERSON, I JUST...

22:25.712 --> 22:29.148
I HAD NEVER SAID
THE THINGS THAT I WAS FEELING,

22:29.181 --> 22:32.885
AND I DIDN'T FEEL
THAT I COULD SAY THOSE THINGS

22:32.919 --> 22:36.022
WITHOUT MAKING
A COMPLETE ASS OF MYSELF,

22:36.055 --> 22:38.891
PRETTY MUCH LIKE
I AM DOING RIGHT NOW.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.795
SO, I WROTE
YOU A LETTER,

22:42.829 --> 22:46.399
AND IN THE LETTER
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.607
MOST OF MY LIFE,
I HAVE FELT ALONE,

22:54.641 --> 22:57.444
EVEN WHEN I WAS
WITH PEOPLE.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.947
THAT WAS UNTIL I MET YOU.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.652
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS LETTER?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.887
I GAVE IT TO MONA.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.590
SHE SAID SHE WOULD
GIVE IT TO YOU.

23:15.528 --> 23:19.532
UM, I APPRECIATE
THAT YOU...

23:19.566 --> 23:22.068
CAME BACK HERE
TO TELL ME THAT,

23:22.101 --> 23:24.937
BUT DOESN'T CHANGE
WHAT YOU DID.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.039
IF YOU--

23:27.073 --> 23:29.509
IF YOU LET ME, I--

23:29.542 --> 23:31.878
I KNOW I CAN MAKE
IT UP TO YOU.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.983
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

23:40.887 --> 23:44.090
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGET
THAT YOU WERE USING ME.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.859
I'M SORRY.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.464
I BELIEVE YOU.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.166
BUT...

23:54.200 --> 23:56.869
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.646
( sighs )

24:10.650 --> 24:11.984
GOOD-BYE, HANNA.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.109
OH, HANNA!

24:37.143 --> 24:40.112
OOH, LOVING THAT SCARF.
DID YOU GET THAT TODAY?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.948
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.950
DO WHAT, SWEETIE?
I KNOW ABOUT THE LETTER.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.152
THE LETTER?

24:46.185 --> 24:48.120
THE LETTER CALEB
LEFT FOR ME.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.956
THE ONE YOU NEVER
GAVE ME, SWEETIE?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.591
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE MY FRIEND.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.093
I AM YOUR FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY I DID IT.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.596
NO ONE HAS EVER HURT YOU
THE WAY THAT HE DID,

24:56.629 --> 24:58.831
AND I COULDN'T GIVE HIM
A CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.133
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR ME.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.570
SORRY.
I SCREWED UP, OKAY?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.237
I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.039
I THOUGHT I WAS
PROTECTING YOU.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.308
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.744
CALEB REALLY DID HURT ME...

25:13.112 --> 25:14.947
BUT THIS HURTS MORE.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.549
I'M SORRY, HANNA.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.751
IF I COULD TAKE IT BACK,
I WOULD.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.219
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.821
SORRY I'M LATE.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.003
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.071
NO.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.676
* WHEN YOUR WORLD

25:43.710 --> 25:48.014
* TREMBLES AND QUAKES

25:49.281 --> 25:51.684
* AND YOUR FOOTING

25:51.718 --> 25:57.924
* SUDDENLY SHIFTS AND SHAKES

25:57.957 --> 26:01.093
* TAKE MY HAND
( cell phone dings )

26:01.127 --> 26:04.797
* WE'LL HIDE IN THE CORNER,
 HIDE IN THE CORNER *

26:04.831 --> 26:07.166
* TAKE MY HAND

26:07.199 --> 26:10.703
* WE'LL HIDE TILL IT'S OVER,
 TILL IT'S ALL OVER *

26:10.737 --> 26:12.138
* TILL IT'S ALL OVER

26:12.171 --> 26:15.708
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD TALK.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.910
EMILY'S
WAITING FOR ME.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.245
IT'S IMPORTANT.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.347
WELL, I'M PLAYING
CATCH-UP IN TRIG.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.083
THAT'S YOUR RUSSIAN
HISTORY BOOK.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.758
CUTE OUTFIT.
ARE YOU WEARING IT FOR EMILY?

26:31.791 --> 26:34.160
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TOBY,

26:34.193 --> 26:36.629
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO MOM AND DAD.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.230
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

26:40.266 --> 26:42.869
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT I SAID,

26:42.902 --> 26:45.872
ABOUT NOT WANTING YOU
AROUND THE BABY.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.341
WE PICKED A NAME. TAYLOR.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.712
IT WORKS FOR A BOY
OR A GIRL.

26:54.881 --> 26:57.149
I LIKE IT.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.191
I DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT THE POLICE THINK,

27:05.224 --> 27:07.326
THAT IAN TOOK THAT MONEY
AND LEFT TOWN.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.796
HE WANTED THIS BABY
AS MUCH AS I DO.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.097
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

27:11.130 --> 27:12.932
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IAN IS,

27:12.965 --> 27:14.967
AND I'VE RUN OUT
OF PLACES TO LOOK.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.369
TELL ME AGAIN
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CHURCH.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.271
I'VE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING, MELISSA.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.274
NO, I WASN'T LISTENING,
BUT NOW I AM.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.810
SO, YOU BELIEVE ME?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.945
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE,

27:25.978 --> 27:30.817
BUT I KNOW IAN
WOULD NEVER LEAVE ME.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.390
YOU CAN'T PAINT OVER THIS.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.862
WHEN WE LEAVE, IT'LL BE
LIKE I WAS NEVER HERE.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.470
* YOU KNOW...

27:51.503 --> 27:53.105
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

27:53.139 --> 27:54.774
MY MOM IS
GONNA KILL ME.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.076
NO, I PROMISE, I'LL MAKE
IT LOOK LIKE NEW.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.878
( cell phone dings )

28:03.115 --> 28:05.852
IT'S SPENCER.
SHE CAN'T MAKE IT.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.124
I'M SORRY.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.894
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
SHOULD BE SORRY ABOUT.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.466
ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.502
I LET YOU DOWN WHEN I
THOUGHT YOU HURT ALISON.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.304
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.474
IT'S HISTORY, OKAY?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.111
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE,

28:32.144 --> 28:35.748
BUT I ALWAYS KNEW
THAT I WAS DIFFERENT.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.850
YOU ARE.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.386
THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT YOU.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.822
I GOT SO GOOD
AT HIDING IT,

28:42.855 --> 28:44.523
BUT YOU SAW IT.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.160
I SAW THE WAY
YOU LOOKED AT MAYA.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.296
YOU LOVED HER.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.133
I MISS TALKING TO YOU.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.468
I FEEL LIKE I'M LEAVING
FOUR FRIENDS NOW.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.138
EMILY, DID YOU SEE
HOW EASY IT WAS

28:59.171 --> 29:01.908
FOR US TO GET
BACK TO THIS PLACE?

29:01.941 --> 29:04.476
IT'LL ALWAYS BE LIKE THAT.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.352
( knocking )

29:16.889 --> 29:19.025
HEY. YOU'RE EARLY.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.326
COME IN.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.966
REALLY GLAD YOU CALLED.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.068
I READ YESTERDAY'S PAPER.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.537
WE DIDN'T LIE
TO THE POLICE.

29:31.570 --> 29:35.307
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS BODY, BUT IAN'S DEAD.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.943
I BELIEVE YOU.

29:36.976 --> 29:40.046
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.881
I'M NOT ALONE.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.150
I UNDERSTAND,
YOU HAVE YOUR FRIENDS,

29:44.183 --> 29:46.418
BUT YOU HAVE ME, TOO.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.254
YOU JUST DON'T REALIZE IT.

29:50.056 --> 29:53.860
YOU SAID YESTERDAY
THAT THINGS HADN'T CHANGED.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.263
IT FEELS LIKE
THEY HAVE.

29:57.296 --> 30:01.167
ASK ME ANYTHING,
I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.441
WHY DID SHE END IT?

30:10.877 --> 30:13.212
SHE, UH, THOUGHT
SHE WAS READY FOR

30:13.245 --> 30:15.314
THE COMMITMENT,
BUT SHE WASN'T.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.051
AM I YOUR REBOUND?

30:19.085 --> 30:21.854
NO. NO, BUT...

30:21.888 --> 30:25.057
YOU DID HELP ME
TO GET OVER HER.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.493
WERE YOU...

30:27.526 --> 30:30.229
STILL IN LOVE WITH HER
WHEN YOU MET ME?

30:33.465 --> 30:35.267
UH...

30:42.508 --> 30:44.643
I WISH I WOULD'VE
KNOWN THAT.

30:44.676 --> 30:49.315
ARIA, THERE WAS
NOT ONE MOMENT

30:49.348 --> 30:53.219
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER
THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
ANYBODY BUT YOU.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.896
THANK YOU
FOR BEING HONEST.

31:03.930 --> 31:07.099
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT SATURDAYS?

31:07.133 --> 31:11.103
IT'S THAT FEELING I GET
WHEN I LOOK UP AT YOU

31:11.137 --> 31:15.507
AND I REALIZE THAT WE HAVE
THE WHOLE DAY TO BE TOGETHER.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.280
YEAH, I KNOW
THAT FEELING.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.150
SO, WILL YOU STAY?

31:30.522 --> 31:34.093
HEY, CAN I CALL
YOU TOMORROW?

31:35.627 --> 31:39.331
UM, I'M SPENDING THE DAY
WITH MY FAMILY.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.300
YEAH.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.501
I'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.208
( cell phone dinging )

32:13.265 --> 32:16.268
AND HE, SHE, "SHIM,"
MUST'VE SEEN ME

32:16.302 --> 32:18.404
GET THAT KEY
FROM UNDER THE DOORMAT.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.539
LET ME SEE THAT.

32:22.541 --> 32:26.245
OKAY, I SEE BOOKS,
PHOTOGRAPHS, MAGAZINES...

32:28.080 --> 32:29.415
WHAT?

32:29.448 --> 32:30.682
IS THAT A PLAYBOY?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.318
WHAT?
NO, RIGHT THERE,

32:32.351 --> 32:34.053
UNDER THAT BLACK THING
ON THE CABINET.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.721
THAT BLACK THING
IS CALLED A TYPEWRITER.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.324
HAN, THAT'S NOT A PLAYBOY.
 THAT'S A PLAY BILL.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.392
I DON'T THINK
WHAT'S MISSING MATTERS.

32:40.426 --> 32:43.495
"A" WANTS US TO KNOW
THAT SHE CAN COME AND GO
THROUGH EZRA'S APARTMENT.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.497
WHEN'S IT GONNA STOP?

32:45.531 --> 32:47.499
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE
A FEW MONTHS AGO?

32:47.533 --> 32:49.568
VISITING ME
IN THE HOSPITAL.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.403
"A" HIT HANNA
AND KEPT ON GOING.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.405
"A" DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE
BEFORE PUSHING IAN.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.541
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.610
I DON'T WANT TO BE
SITTING NEXT TO YOU GUYS
AT ANOTHER FUNERAL.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.547
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TELL THE THERAPIST?

33:03.282 --> 33:06.318
WE WERE REALLY CLOSE
TO TELLING HER YESTERDAY.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.520
IT FELT SO GOOD.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.522
TELLING ANNE WOULDN'T BE
LIKE TELLING OUR PARENTS.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.225
I MEAN, SHE HAS TO KEEP IT
A SECRET, RIGHT?

33:13.259 --> 33:15.561
LOOK, OKAY, I KNOW
 WE PROMISED GARRETT

33:15.594 --> 33:18.264
THAT WE WOULDN'T SHOW
 THE VIDEO TO THE COPS,

33:18.297 --> 33:21.600
BUT, I MEAN, IF WE WANT
 ANNE TO BELIEVE US...

33:21.633 --> 33:24.436
A PICTURE'S WORTH
A THOUSAND WORDS.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.139
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS WEARING
A GORGEOUS PAIR OF KHLOES.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.440
WHO?

33:28.474 --> 33:30.142
THE SHRINK.

33:30.176 --> 33:33.212
AND THIS IS RELEVANT
TO THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE...?

33:33.245 --> 33:35.414
YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT
 A PERSON BY THEIR SHOES.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.683
I REALLY HEARD HER
WHEN SHE SAID THAT WE

33:37.716 --> 33:39.418
DON'T HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THIS ALONE.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.691
DO WE ALL AGREE?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.502
THANK YOU
FOR SEEING US TODAY.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.471
IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS
SOMETHING YOU REALLY
WANTED TO TELL ME.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.473
THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING
WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.513
UM, I JUST WANT TO GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT HERE.

34:07.546 --> 34:11.317
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL
ANYONE ANYTHING THAT WE SAY
IN HERE, RIGHT?

34:11.350 --> 34:14.152
UNLESS YOU TELL ME SOMETHING
THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE

34:14.186 --> 34:16.487
THAT YOU'RE
A DANGER TO YOURSELF
OR TO SOMEONE ELSE.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.725
OKAY. HANNA?

34:19.757 --> 34:22.860
I DIDN'T KNOW TORI
MADE THOSE BOOTS IN BROWN.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.297
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

34:27.132 --> 34:29.101
YEAH.
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.735
GO AHEAD, EMILY.

34:30.768 --> 34:34.239
I THINK WE SHOULD
TELL HER FIRST, AND THEN...

34:34.273 --> 34:35.607
YEAH, SURE.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.646
ARIA?

34:40.679 --> 34:44.416
WE DID DRIFT APART
AFTER ALISON WENT MISSING...

34:44.449 --> 34:47.686
AND IT'S TRUE THAT HER--

34:47.719 --> 34:50.688
HER DEATH BROUGHT US
BACK TOGETHER.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.827
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE'D BE
AS CLOSE AS WE ARE NOW--

34:55.860 --> 34:57.863
THIS TALK
IS PREMATURE.

35:07.406 --> 35:10.642
UM, I'M SORRY
WE WASTED YOUR TIME.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.244
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.580
UM, YOU KNOW, WE
NEED TO FIGURE OUT

35:14.613 --> 35:17.849
WHAT WE WANT TO SAY
SO THAT WE CAN

35:17.883 --> 35:20.386
COMMUNICATE MORE,
UM, EFFECTIVELY,

35:20.419 --> 35:22.254
AND-- AND THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.689
SO, WE'RE GONNA
RESCHEDULE.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.857
YOU GIRLS
CALLED ME, REMEMBER?

35:25.891 --> 35:30.296
YEAH. I-I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.842
WELL, IF SHE DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE CRAZY BEFORE,

35:43.875 --> 35:45.877
SHE DOES NOW.
WHAT WAS THAT?

35:48.414 --> 35:49.781
WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS?

35:49.815 --> 35:51.483
ON THE BOOKSHELF
BEHIND THE SHRINK.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.452
THIS IS WHAT "A"
TOOK FROM EZRA'S.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.686
"A" KNOWS
WE'RE COMING HERE.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.355
AND THAT WE WERE GONNA TELL.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.590
HOW IS "A" ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US?

35:58.624 --> 36:00.559
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT BITCH HAS SUPERPOWERS.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.361
WE'VE GOTTA TELL EZRA
TO CHANGE HIS LOCKS.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.437
( knocking )

36:11.470 --> 36:12.638
COME IN.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.642
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

36:18.944 --> 36:21.380
YEAH. WHAT'S WRONG?

36:21.413 --> 36:24.483
WELL, WE JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE
WITH YOUR THERAPIST.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.518
AND SHE DIDN'T TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,

36:26.552 --> 36:28.754
BUT SHE DID TELL US
SHE DIDN'T THINK

36:28.787 --> 36:30.289
IT'S GONNA BE HELPFUL

36:30.322 --> 36:32.691
TO CONTINUE SEEING YOU GIRLS
AS A GROUP.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.927
( scoffs ) YEAH.
DON'T REALLY BLAME HER.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.596
AND BASED
ON YOUR SESSIONS,

36:37.629 --> 36:39.431
SHE'S MAKING
A RECOMMENDATION

36:39.465 --> 36:42.368
THAT, UH,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BACK HER UP ON.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.602
FOR NOW.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.337
A RECOMMENDATION
FOR WHAT?

36:45.371 --> 36:47.606
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE
YOU GIRLS ARE CAPABLE

36:47.639 --> 36:50.576
OF MAINTAINING A HEALTHY
FRIENDSHIP AT THE MOMENT,

36:50.609 --> 36:54.513
SO SHE'S RECOMMENDING
THAT YOU SPEND SOME TIME APART.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.948
YEAH, AND DR. SULLIVAN
SAID SHE'S SEEN THIS BEFORE.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.451
AFTER A TRAUMATIC LOSS,
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

36:59.485 --> 37:02.621
FOR A CLOSE-KNIT GROUP
OF FRIENDS TO DISCONNECT
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.556
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.458
WE'RE NOT SAYING
THIS IS FOREVER.

37:06.492 --> 37:10.362
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT I CAN'T SEE MY FRIENDS?

37:10.396 --> 37:17.603
* NO, I CAN'T TAKE
 ONE MORE STEP TOWARDS YOU *

37:17.636 --> 37:22.374
* 'CAUSE ALL THAT'S WAITING
 IS REGRET *

37:24.543 --> 37:30.516
* AND DON'T YOU KNOW
 I'M NOT YOUR GHOST ANYMORE *

37:30.549 --> 37:36.788
* YOU LOST THE LOVE
 I LOVED THE MOST *

37:36.822 --> 37:43.529
* I LEARNED TO LIVE
 HALF A LIFE *

37:43.562 --> 37:49.301
* AND NOW YOU WANT ME
 ONE MORE TIME *

37:49.335 --> 37:55.574
* WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE

37:55.607 --> 38:00.679
* WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE

38:07.052 --> 38:09.321
( rustling )

38:51.530 --> 38:52.798
( knife clatters )

38:52.831 --> 38:54.566
( sobbing )

38:55.634 --> 38:57.903
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.456
( alarm chirps )

40:02.934 --> 40:05.504
LOCK THE DOOR.

40:05.537 --> 40:06.838
YES, SIR.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.691
( cell phone beeps )

40:49.047 --> 40:51.182
( cell phone ringing )

41:10.836 --> 41:12.938
ANYONE COULD'VE
SENT THAT, SPENCE.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.906
YEAH, AND IT COULD
JUST BE SOME KOOK

41:14.940 --> 41:16.508
TRYING TO MESS
WITH MELISSA.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.910
MAYBE, BUT IT
DOESN'T SEEM RANDOM.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.846
"IT'S NOT SAFE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU"?

41:20.879 --> 41:21.913
CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT?

41:21.947 --> 41:23.148
WHERE HE IS.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.652
GUYS, IAN IS DEAD.
WE ALL SAW HIM.

41:26.685 --> 41:29.020
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.789
SEND A REPLY.

41:33.224 --> 41:36.728
HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS YOU?

41:42.634 --> 41:43.935
( cell phone dings )

41:48.774 --> 41:52.210
UM, WHAT'S SOMETHING
THAT ONLY IAN WOULD
BE ABLE TO ANSWER?

41:52.243 --> 41:54.713
HOLD ON. I KNOW.

41:54.746 --> 41:58.750
WHAT ARE WE NAMING OUR BABY?

41:58.784 --> 42:02.520
WHAT IS THE NAME?
TAYLOR.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.323
( gasps )

42:05.356 --> 42:07.092
IT'S HIM!

42:07.125 --> 42:09.094
IAN'S ALIVE.

42:09.127 --> 42:10.662
( banging )

42:17.803 --> 42:20.205
I SEE YOU FOUND
THE GUEST BEDROOM.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.274
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THE MASTER?
