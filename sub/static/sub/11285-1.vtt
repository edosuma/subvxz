YOU KILLED HER!

JAMES: YOU KILLED HER!

35:19.585 --> 35:21.418

YOU DID IT!

35:21.420 --> 35:24.187
<i> YOU DON'T CALL ME A KILLER,</i>

35:54.419 --> 35:56.686
KOWALSKI:
SO IT WAS A COMPLEX SITUATION.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.322
ED:
IT WAS A COMPLEX SITUATION.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.258
KOWALSKI:
IN THE AUDIO LOG,
IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES

36:01.260 --> 36:02.759
BEFORE SCORPIO COMMAND,

36:02.761 --> 36:05.762
THERE WERE NUMEROUS VOICES,
RAISED VOICES,

36:05.764 --> 36:07.397
SHOUTED INSTRUCTIONS.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.733
THE IMPRESSION IT GIVES IS...

36:09.735 --> 36:11.268
LOSS OF CONTROL.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.605
(IN A LOW, MENACING VOICE)
WE HAD COMPLETE CONTROL.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.241
WHAT YOU HEARD
WAS COMMUNICATION

36:18.243 --> 36:19.576
BETWEEN MEMBERS
OF MY TEAM.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.645
THE RAISED VOICES WERE
OUR INSTRUCTIONS

36:21.647 --> 36:24.314
TO MAY DALTON,
WE WERE...

36:24.316 --> 36:27.217
TRYING TO AVOID
THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE.

36:27.219 --> 36:30.587
THERE WERE... TWO GUNSHOTS
BEFORE SCORPIO CALL.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.089
YES.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.590
YOU ALLOWED HER TO FIRE
BEFORE SCORPIO CALL.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.392
<i>SHE RAISED HER WEAPON,</i>

36:35.394 --> 36:36.593
HER GRIP WAS UNSTEADY-

36:36.595 --> 36:38.395
YOU ALLOWED HER
TO FIRE TWICE.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.596
ISN'T THAT A BREACH
OF PROTOCOL?

36:39.598 --> 36:41.464
<i>YOU HEARD THE AUDIO.</i>

36:41.466 --> 36:44.267
WE WERE TRYING
TO GET HER TO STOP.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.335
NOTED.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.638
YOUR SERGEANT, GREG PARKER,
STATES...

36:48.640 --> 36:50.373
SHE WAS IN THE "TUNNEL."

36:50.375 --> 36:51.808
SHE STEADIED HER RIGHT HAND
WITH HER LEFT,

36:51.810 --> 36:54.744
AND PREPARED TO FIRE
A THIRD TIME.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.649
SHE CROSSED THE LINE,
I TOOK THE SHOT.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.451
AFTER YOUR SERGEANT'S
SCORPIO COMMAND?

37:01.453 --> 37:03.103
AT THE SAME TIME.

37:03.104 --> 37:04.754
AND ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT
ALL OPTIONS WERE EXHAUSTED

37:04.756 --> 37:07.490
BEFORE THE USE
OF LETHAL FORCE?

37:08.794 --> 37:12.329
(THREATENING TONE)
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

37:12.331 --> 37:13.964
KOWALSKI:
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

37:13.966 --> 37:15.799
YOU KNOW THE PROCESS.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.404
SPIKE:
SHE WAS RIGHT BESIDE ME
IN THE TRUCK,

37:21.406 --> 37:23.273
HOW COULD I NOT HAVE KNOWN?

37:23.275 --> 37:24.858
JULES:
SPIKE, WHAT,

37:24.859 --> 37:26.442
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FRISK
ALL OUR WITNESSES?

37:26.445 --> 37:28.678
SAM:
OKAY, MAY SAID SHE AND HER MOM
NEVER FELT SAFE, RIGHT?

37:28.680 --> 37:30.280
THAT THE COPS COULDN'T
PROTECT THEM?

37:30.282 --> 37:31.414
SPIKE:
THAT HE COULD TRACK THEM DOWN
ANYWHERE.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.183
I REMEMBER THAT.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.951
PARKER:
"TOBIAS HAS DONE EVERYTHING
SO THAT WE CAN FEEL SAFE."

37:34.953 --> 37:36.386
COME ON, FROM THAT,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW

37:36.388 --> 37:38.321
THAT TOBIAS PROCURED HER
AN ILLEGAL GUN,

37:38.323 --> 37:39.990
<i> WHICH SHE KEPT WITH HER</i>
<i> AT ALL TIMES, JUST IN CASE?</i>

37:39.992 --> 37:41.591
PARKER:
SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
ON THAT ROOF;

37:41.593 --> 37:42.659
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

37:42.661 --> 37:43.660
<i> SPIKE:</i>
<i> BOSS, DON'T GO THERE.</i>

37:43.662 --> 37:44.661
WE ALL SIGNED OFF
ON IT.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.380
<i> SAM:</i>
<i> IT WAS A JUDGMENT CALL.</i>

37:46.381 --> 37:48.098
<i> SPIKE:</i>
<i> SHE INSISTED -</i>
<i> YOU ALL HEARD THAT, RIGHT?</i>

37:48.099 --> 37:49.816
SHE SAID, "LET ME GO UP THERE,
LET ME TALK TO HIM."

37:49.817 --> 37:51.534
PARKER:
THAT'S IRRELEVANT;
SHE WAS EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

37:51.536 --> 37:52.736
<i> THAT WASN'T HER CHOICE</i>
<i> TO MAKE.</i>

37:52.738 --> 37:54.354
WE MADE THAT CHOICE.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.971
SPIKE:
SHE KNEW WHEN SHE SAID IT
THAT SHE HAD A LOADED WEAPON.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.841
I'M JUST SAYING.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.676
SAM:
ALL RIGHT, BEAN BAG ROUNDS.
RAF AND SPIKE,

37:59.678 --> 38:01.911
IF WE SENT YOU FROM HERE
AND HERE, AND WE TIMED IT-

38:01.913 --> 38:04.347
SAM, WE DON'T TAKE
THAT RISK,

38:04.349 --> 38:05.849
NOT WHEN THE SUBJECT
HAS A WEAPON

38:05.851 --> 38:07.751
INCHES FROM THE VICTIM!

38:07.752 --> 38:09.652
SAM:
I KNOW, BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS
WE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY

38:09.655 --> 38:11.721
WHEN HE WAS DISTRACTED
BY MAY COMING TOWARDS-

38:11.723 --> 38:13.857
JULES:
I WAS THE ONE
WHO LET HER RUN.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.759
<i> (EMOTIONS RISING)</i>
<i> I HAD HER, HAND ON SHOULDER.</i>

38:15.761 --> 38:17.560
SHE WAS SAFE.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.778
<i> AND NEXT THING I KNOW</i>

38:18.779 --> 38:19.995
SHE'S RUNNING INTO
THE LINE OF FIRE.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.966
ED:
ALL RIGHT, STOP!
JUST STOP.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.637
WE DID NOTHING WRONG.
WE FOLLOWED PROTOCOL.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.342
AN EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S DEAD

38:32.344 --> 38:34.811
AND THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.513
<i> SHE WAS A BRAVE GIRL.</i>

38:36.515 --> 38:38.648
SHE DESERVED TO LIVE,

38:38.650 --> 38:41.484
AND IT IS A TRAGEDY
THAT SHE'S GONE.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.585
<i> BUT SHE KNEW </i>
<i> WHAT SHE WAS DOING;</i>

38:42.587 --> 38:44.321
<i> SHE WAS ARMED.</i>

38:44.323 --> 38:45.989
SHE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER,

38:45.991 --> 38:47.791
AND WE HAVE A CODE,
WE HAVE RULES,

38:47.793 --> 38:51.328
<i> SO THAT WHEN</i>
<i> WE ARE UNDER PRESSURE</i>

38:51.330 --> 38:55.398
WE FUNCTION AS A TEAM
AND WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.601
THIS ONE TIME,
WE COULD'VE MADE AN EXCEPTION.

38:58.603 --> 38:59.602
WE COULD'VE TAKEN THE RISK.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.004
WE COULD'VE SHOT TO WOUND.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.405
JULES:
RAF, THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

39:02.406 --> 39:03.806
<i> RAF:</i>
<i> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? HOW 'BOUT</i>
<i> I JUST DO US ALL A FAVOR</i>

39:03.809 --> 39:06.076
AND SAY WHAT WE'RE
ALL THINKING.

39:06.078 --> 39:08.745
WE COULD'VE JUST HELD FIRE
AND...

39:10.015 --> 39:11.915
LET HER KILL HIM.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.650
(THE TEAM'S SILENT)

39:18.023 --> 39:20.657
(DEADLY QUIET)
NO, WE COULDN'T.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.125
<i> NO, WE COULDN'T.</i>

39:23.061 --> 39:24.527
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.763
WE ARE NOT JUDGES,
WE ARE COPS.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.399
WE'RE COPS AND WE ALL -
ALL OF US -

39:29.401 --> 39:30.633
HAVE TO BE ON
THE SAME PAGE.

39:30.635 --> 39:31.868
PARKER:
OKAY, LET'S ALL SIT DOWN.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.102
RAF:
I GET IT, ALL RIGHT?
I GET THAT'S THE JOB-

39:33.105 --> 39:35.138
NO, NO, NO!
WE DON'T GET TO WING IT.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.040
WE DON'T GET TO CHOOSE
WHICH RULES WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW;

39:37.042 --> 39:38.074
<i> THAT'S WHAT</i>
<i> THE BAD GUYS DO.</i>

39:38.076 --> 39:41.778

WE SERVE THE LAW.

NOW, ARE YOU GOOD
WITH THAT?

39:45.984 --> 39:49.853
<i> RAF:</i>
<i> ED, I RESPECT THAT THIS IS</i>
<i> WHAT YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE </i>

39:49.855 --> 39:51.955
TO GET THROUGH THIS,

39:51.957 --> 39:53.340
OH MAN...

39:53.341 --> 39:54.724

I'M JUST SAYING,
IF THAT'S THE JOB...

39:54.726 --> 39:56.092
(FIGHTING HIS EMOTIONS)

39:58.897 --> 40:02.832
LOOK, I AM VERY SERIOUS
ABOUT SERVING THE LAW,

40:05.003 --> 40:08.071

THE PROUDEST OF MY LIFE,

40:08.073 --> 40:09.606

IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.117

<i> RAF:</i>
<i> I KNOW, I GET THAT, BOSS.</i>

40:22.821 --> 40:24.888

THIS...

40:26.491 --> 40:28.558
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.796
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.450
WHY DON'T YOU SLEEP ON IT?

40:37.451 --> 40:39.034
