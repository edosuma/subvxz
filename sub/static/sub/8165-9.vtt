and you haven't accepted me,

08:54.371 --> 08:56.051
so now it looks like
I'm engaged to myself.

08:56.406 --> 08:58.726
- Sorry, babe, I just have
to tie up some loose ends first.

08:59.309 --> 09:00.589
- What do you mean,
"loose ends"?

09:00.877 --> 09:02.197
- You know,
it's just some friends

09:02.479 --> 09:04.239
that deserve to hear
the good news in person.

09:04.881 --> 09:06.121
- Okay.
We're gonna pick a night

09:06.984 --> 09:08.951
and tie up
those loose ends together, okay?

09:10.921 --> 09:11.921
I got to go.

known as Potter's Hollow.</i>

09:34.077 --> 09:35.077
- Beautiful.

09:36.279 --> 09:37.379

09:56.433 --> 09:57.666
- Oh!

09:58.902 --> 09:59.902
Okay.

10:00.070 --> 10:01.070
[continues barking]

10:01.171 --> 10:03.011
- I guess you missed
the "No Trespassing" sign.

10:04.341 --> 10:04.923
- Sorry.

10:05.108 --> 10:06.588
We met at the Brooklyn Flea,
remember?

10:07.344 --> 10:08.344
Uh, Stella...

10:08.979 --> 10:10.419
- Right, right.
- I read your essays,

10:10.847 --> 10:12.380
and I just had to
come talk to you.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.066
I'm not a stalker.

10:16.820 --> 10:17.652
I work in publishing.

10:17.654 --> 10:19.094
- Well, I wrote
those essays for fun.

10:19.890 --> 10:21.022
I never really thought
about publishing them.

10:21.558 --> 10:23.478
- And I came up here
to make you think otherwise.

10:25.228 --> 10:26.027
- Okay.

10:26.029 --> 10:27.062
What's your pitch?

10:28.465 --> 10:31.332
- People want a glimpse
of a simpler life.

10:31.334 --> 10:32.917
We are all such slaves
to social media.

10:34.504 --> 10:36.224
You live and write
with a clarity of purpose

10:37.240 --> 10:38.239
most people are missing
right now.

10:38.442 --> 10:41.376
I think your story is like
an American "Year in Provence."

10:44.314 --> 10:45.314
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:45.348 --> 10:47.268
That guy went on to become
kind of famous, right?

10:47.617 --> 10:48.977
See, I don't want
to become famous.

10:49.352 --> 10:51.472
- I think that's what's known
as a high-class problem.

10:52.923 --> 10:54.089
- For you, maybe.

10:55.258 --> 10:56.274
- Would you at least be open

10:56.293 --> 10:58.326
to developing your essays
into something more...

11:00.363 --> 11:01.363
maybe a book?

11:02.332 --> 11:04.282
- In a way,
I've already written it.

11:07.237 --> 11:10.171
Five years of my life
here on the farm.

11:10.173 --> 11:11.122
Some fairly quotidian stuff,

11:11.274 --> 11:12.594
but you're welcome
to take a look.

11:13.276 --> 11:14.242
- I would love to read a copy.

11:14.411 --> 11:16.491
- You're looking at the one
and only copy right here.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.187
- What if I wanted
someone else to take a look?

11:20.217 --> 11:21.817
- Wherever the book goes, I go.

11:23.420 --> 11:24.420
- Understood.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.172
- Have at it.
[chuckles]

11:31.361 --> 11:32.160
Take sugar?

11:32.162 --> 11:33.411
- Just a little honey.
- All right.

11:33.412 --> 11:34.661
Take sugar?

11:39.202 --> 11:40.502
- I'm done.

11:40.504 --> 11:41.737
- One minute.

11:45.342 --> 11:46.274
I love it.

11:46.276 --> 11:47.175
It's so resonant right now

11:47.277 --> 11:49.317
with everyone so hyper-connected
and overstimulated.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.400
I think there's something
really zeitgeisty here.

11:53.383 --> 11:54.983
- And I'm sure
I'll never eat lamb again.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.099
So a handwritten manuscript

11:57.587 --> 11:59.604
on the wonders of solitude
and... sheep farming.

12:01.625 --> 12:02.908
How am I supposed
to market that?

12:04.194 --> 12:05.194
- Sebastian?

12:06.496 --> 12:09.297
Sebastian, I would like you
to meet Kelsey Peters,

12:09.299 --> 12:10.299
head of Millennial Print

12:10.367 --> 12:11.950
and Diana Trout,
head of Marketing.

12:14.971 --> 12:17.405
- Okay. I think I know how.

12:22.212 --> 12:23.678
- Thank you.

12:24.514 --> 12:27.015
- So what do you do for fun
up on the farm?

12:27.017 --> 12:29.377
- Oh, I had my share of fun
for about ten years living here.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.703
Fun can be very exhausting.

12:33.089 --> 12:34.789
- So, um, no significant other?

12:36.493 --> 12:37.533
- There was my ex, Leslie.

12:38.295 --> 12:38.993
- Right, of course.

12:39.095 --> 12:40.495
I remember her from the book.
- Yes.

12:40.597 --> 12:42.237
- She lasted about six months
on the farm.

12:43.366 --> 12:44.432
- Yes. Yeah, yeah.
Until she decided

12:44.501 --> 12:46.501
a life without reliable Wi-Fi
was not worth living.

12:48.371 --> 12:49.437
- You don't get lonely?

12:50.507 --> 12:51.667
- Ah, the work keeps me busy.

12:52.509 --> 12:54.229
The moon and stars
keep me company at night.

12:55.612 --> 12:56.812
- What about when it's cloudy?

12:57.447 --> 12:58.447
- Oh, I knit.

13:00.383 --> 13:01.349
Yeah.

13:01.351 --> 13:01.750
[both laugh]

13:01.751 --> 13:02.150
Yeah.

13:02.152 --> 13:04.232
No. You'd be amazed how much
more you appreciate life

13:05.989 --> 13:06.989
when it all slows down.

13:07.757 --> 13:08.256
- I bet.

13:08.358 --> 13:10.158
- I used to be
the poster child for this mess.

13:10.727 --> 13:11.409
[inhales, exhales]

13:11.494 --> 13:12.276
You know, if there's one thing

13:12.662 --> 13:13.878
I hope people
can really take from my book,

13:14.297 --> 13:16.457
it's that you can totally
reinvent your life on a whim.

13:18.168 --> 13:20.218
- I can certainly
relate to that.

13:24.307 --> 13:25.440
Josh.
- Liza.

13:25.442 --> 13:27.242
Greta, do you remember
my friend, Liza?

13:29.045 --> 13:30.325
- Hi.
- [ahem] This is Sebastian.

13:31.248 --> 13:32.328
He's writing a book for us.

13:33.049 --> 13:34.449
- What's up, dude?
Nice to meet you.

13:35.151 --> 13:36.151
- And you. Hello.

13:36.253 --> 13:37.453
- Nice to meet you, Sebastian.

13:37.654 --> 13:39.120
- Have a nice dinner.
- You too.

13:44.361 --> 13:46.527
That was my ex.
We just split up.

13:46.529 --> 13:48.329
- Another nice thing
about living on a farm...

13:49.699 --> 13:51.166
you never run into your exes.

13:58.475 --> 14:01.776
- Okay, baby.
It's time to open the kimono.

14:01.778 --> 14:02.778
- Let's open it.

14:04.414 --> 14:05.680
- Who's Alison West?

14:05.682 --> 14:07.482
- She is a barista at Stumptown.

14:09.286 --> 14:10.286
- Unfriend.

14:10.654 --> 14:11.436
Stephanie Roberts?

14:11.621 --> 14:12.570
- An analyst at Morgan Stanley.

14:12.722 --> 14:14.402
- She's poking you.
- It's a business poke.

14:15.792 --> 14:16.792
- Unfriend.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.042
Amanda Potter.

14:18.528 --> 14:19.528
- She is
my cousin-in-law.

14:20.530 --> 14:21.570
- That's not a real thing.

14:22.599 --> 14:23.759
Buh-bye.
- Babe, you're harsh.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.954
- Is there anyone else here
that is gonna be surprised

14:27.604 --> 14:29.644
when you change your
relationship status to engaged?

14:30.307 --> 14:31.940
- Ah, baby,
just a couple people.

14:33.576 --> 14:35.009
- Like who?
- My parents.

14:37.614 --> 14:39.480
- You haven't told
your parents yet?

14:39.482 --> 14:40.331
- They're still out of town.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.183
- Then my vagina is out of town.

14:44.421 --> 14:47.188
- Is your mouth out of town?

14:47.190 --> 14:48.890
<i>[upbeat pop tune]</i>

14:50.593 --> 14:52.543
- How was dinner
with the hot shepherd?

14:54.497 --> 14:56.915
- Oh, it was great until
we ran into Josh and Greta.

14:59.336 --> 14:59.784
- Oh.

14:59.836 --> 15:01.236
- I definitely
think they're dating.

15:01.705 --> 15:03.545
- You're not gonna start
baking again, are you?

15:04.207 --> 15:05.006
- I'm happy for him.

15:05.008 --> 15:06.448
Seeing him with a girl
his own age...

15:07.310 --> 15:08.042
makes sense.

15:08.178 --> 15:09.778
- I thought
the shepherd sounded perfect.

15:09.846 --> 15:11.513
Like, off the grid,
way out of town.

15:13.183 --> 15:14.943
- I am not ready
to jump back into something.

15:16.853 --> 15:19.787
And besides...
it's a work thing.

15:19.789 --> 15:21.709
- You know, before Josh,
you didn't have sex for,

15:22.726 --> 15:23.808
like, what, two years?

15:24.894 --> 15:26.454
Don't let your pilot light
go out again.

15:27.964 --> 15:29.147
Just saying.

15:34.604 --> 15:35.670
- Have Sebastian sign these.

15:35.672 --> 15:36.992
It's boilerplate
for a first book.

15:37.374 --> 15:38.356
- Oh, fantastic!
- And I also think

15:38.541 --> 15:40.341
he should be shirtless
for the author's photo.

15:40.910 --> 15:42.270
We need to look
beyond the 4H Club.

15:42.779 --> 15:43.928
Can you have him come
in this morning?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.463
- Oh, I think he already
left for the farm.

15:45.849 --> 15:47.969
- Without signing these?
Liza, what were you thinking?

15:48.918 --> 15:49.583
- I wasn't.

15:49.652 --> 15:50.584
- Drive up there,
get these signed,

15:50.920 --> 15:52.453
and then get back here
with that book.

18:49.999 --> 18:52.700
Stella!

18:58.074 --> 18:59.974
- What? Are you sure?

18:59.976 --> 19:01.409
- Well, he said
he was grooming her,

19:02.845 --> 19:03.845
but...
- But what?

19:03.947 --> 19:05.387
- Oh, please
don't make me repeat it.

19:06.216 --> 19:06.981
- After what I went through

19:07.150 --> 19:08.232
with the Dennis Hastert
high school wrestling memoir,

19:08.918 --> 19:09.834
we can't risk this.
That is what comes

19:10.153 --> 19:12.193
from trying find new authors
at the Farmers' Market.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.342
Maybe you'll have better luck
next time at the circus.

19:16.993 --> 19:19.126
- You know what?
I do have some good news.

19:19.128 --> 19:20.408
Josh unfollowed me on Instagram.

19:21.097 --> 19:21.929
- How is that good news?

19:21.965 --> 19:23.014
- That means
that he misses you so much

19:23.266 --> 19:25.386
he can't even see pictures
of your friends having fun.

19:26.002 --> 19:28.122
- Or maybe he just wants nothing
to do with any of us.

19:28.938 --> 19:30.354
- I like my version
a lot better.

19:31.774 --> 19:32.306
- Hey, babe.

19:32.442 --> 19:33.602
- Hey, babe.
- Hey. Hey, Liza.

19:34.110 --> 19:35.710
Hey, let's go, Kels.
We're gonna be late.

19:36.946 --> 19:37.728
- Yeah.
Wish us luck.

19:37.914 --> 19:39.013
We're going to meet
his parents for dinner,

19:39.315 --> 19:40.795
and we're gonna tell 'em
the big news.

19:40.984 --> 19:41.983
- Babe, I already told them.

19:41.985 --> 19:43.585
I wouldn't just drop a big bomb
like that

19:43.820 --> 19:45.580
with you sitting there.
What if they freaked?

19:45.688 --> 19:46.854
- What?
What did they say?

19:48.024 --> 19:49.374
- They are super pumped.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.794
- We have to go
do something first.

19:55.999 --> 19:58.733
- Okay.
Let's make this official.
