00:00.010 --> 00:03.650
At 1800 hours, the NLF will
be ending my son's life.

00:03.700 --> 00:07.950
They're offering a swap...
Kadir in exchange for George.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.890
We don't talk to terrorists.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.910
I took a look at your
story, poor Valerie Cotton.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.630
You're a pregnant woman, you
don't know what you're saying.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.790
You're the one making
me have these babies!

00:18.840 --> 00:20.630
I'm here to see Martha Franklin.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.030
I'm Captain Martin's wife.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.340
So this is not a friendly visit?

00:24.390 --> 00:26.310
No, I love him.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.790
I don't want you to have anything
to do with this, Armstrong.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.510
You won't pull this off without me.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.630
Tony.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.150
One woman and a child, in
exchange for your great leader.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.660
Mummy! Daddy!

00:39.000 --> 00:41.630
Captain Martin, I'm
placing you under arrest,

00:41.680 --> 00:45.040
for allowing the escape from
lawful custody of a prisoner of war.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.720 --> 01:16.720
Open.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.220
Legs apart.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.640
What are you looking for?

01:57.220 --> 02:00.590
Aden, where east meets west.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.740
Vital as an oil refinery as
well as a Gulf trade route.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.970
The beach here at Aden is lovely.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.700
The sun is warm and the
sharks are not always hungry.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.670
The occasional outbreaks of violence
are caused by what are officially

02:22.720 --> 02:24.340
called dissident tribesmen.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.140
As long as there's trouble,
there must be troops.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.630
The Queen has full confidence in
Aden's future, describing it as

02:34.680 --> 02:37.520
the perfect example of colonial rule.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.350
What are you doing?

02:45.400 --> 02:47.390
Cover for me.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.870
Where are you going?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.190
Look, the NLF will kill
Yusra for what she did.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.640
And we're letting it
happen. I'm not having that.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.200
Please, please.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.760
Corporal Armstrong.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.470
Where is he?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.720
On patrol, sir.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.230
- Get him back.
- Erm, there's no radio contact, sir.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.000
It's a problem up in Radfan.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.150
- Bang! Bang! - I see.
- Bang! Bang! Bang! - Yes.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.230
Bang. Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

04:01.280 --> 04:06.590
That's settled, then. Ten o'clock tomorrow. Goodbye.
- Bang! Bang!

04:06.640 --> 04:09.470
Bit quieter, darling, Daddy
can't hear himself think.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.520
Where's Yusra?

04:15.280 --> 04:18.200
Go and play in your bedroom, George.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.950
Well, they've taken a statement from me,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.110
- which means I have to give evidence.
- In court? Against Joe?

04:29.160 --> 04:32.150
It's not "against" him,
Mary, it's just the facts.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.270
I gave the order, he disobeyed it.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.030
He saved George!

04:36.080 --> 04:39.030
Mary...
- I don't understand. He'd be dead if it weren't for Joe Martin.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.350
An order is an order, there's
nothing I can do for him.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.350
You're part of the prosecution
case against the man

04:45.400 --> 04:46.950
who saved our son's life.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.910
He saved me from the bad men.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.630
Yes.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.880
So why is he in prison?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.360
Will they shoot him, Daddy?

05:23.440 --> 05:25.150
Joe saw all of these.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.030
He was there.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.950
And was asked to deny
that it had ever happened.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.530
But he kept the film.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.520
Yeah, you know a good man by
what he does under pressure.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.710
Do the British want these
photographs destroyed

05:42.760 --> 05:45.050
because they're embarrassing?

05:46.400 --> 05:47.690
Yes.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.550
Because they tell a story
that isn't the official account

05:52.600 --> 05:55.040
of what is happening here?

05:57.040 --> 06:00.310
Sure. Do the families of these
men deserve to see them?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.650
I think so.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.230
I should go to him.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.070
Honor. The little man has to lose.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.370
You do know that?

06:09.920 --> 06:11.200
Every time.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.990
What was it?

06:20.040 --> 06:21.720
You know what the order was.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.160
I can make this so hard for you.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.110
Eczema.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.630
The heat makes it almost intolerable.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.640
He never gets through an
interview without a good scratch.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.080
Maybe this time.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.120
The order was to escort a prisoner.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.550
Who gave you the order?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.150
Major Markham.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.590
Did you obey it?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.550
No.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.760
Do you know what it means
to disobey an order?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.320
Yes.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.560
Sit down.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.550
I had a choice. A child with
his whole life ahead of him...

08:04.600 --> 08:07.590
Who do you think you are?

08:07.640 --> 08:10.710
I want you to listen carefully,

08:10.760 --> 08:13.910
because this is the most important
thing you will ever hear.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.750
The whole of High Command
know who you are,

08:18.800 --> 08:21.630
they're taking a real
interest in Captain Babyface.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.510
If you decide to fight
us, we will expose you.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.990
Does your new wife know
about your sordid past?

08:30.040 --> 08:31.800
What do you want?

08:34.320 --> 08:35.919
Help me.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.799
Help yourself.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.120
Yusra! Yusra?

09:11.600 --> 09:14.630
The NLF don't like it
when you help the enemy.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.230
The family.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.240
Locked inside, burnt to death.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.040
But not Yusra.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.750
Where is she?

09:27.800 --> 09:30.430
I know where she is, but you need to go.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.190
Where is she?! Where is she?!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.350
Where is she? Where is she?!

09:35.400 --> 09:37.030
- Where is she?!
- You should go.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.150
You need to go now. Go now.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.830
Yusra!
Go! You should go! You should go!

09:41.880 --> 09:43.470
You should go, go!

10:17.160 --> 10:19.310
Cucumber.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.040
Thank you.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.430
I want an abortion.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.710
That's against the law.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.640
Yes. I'm asking you to help me.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.680
Why do you feel you want to do this?

10:54.800 --> 10:57.990
Why do you feel you can ask?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.790
I'm a doctor. I can't just...

10:59.840 --> 11:02.040
Really? Why not?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.240
You know better than me what I want?

11:11.880 --> 11:15.110
I didn't ask you here for moral guidance.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.350
It's my duty...

11:16.400 --> 11:17.800
It's none of your business!

11:20.680 --> 11:23.280
I would do it myself
if I could, but I can't.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.720
Please.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.880
What does your husband say?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.280
Joe...

12:26.160 --> 12:29.870
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking
of you. I should have been.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.880
No. No, you were just being brave.

12:34.760 --> 12:41.120
I'll be discharged from the army
and I... It'll be years, Honor...

12:44.040 --> 12:47.510
and when I get out...

12:47.560 --> 12:53.360
don't wait for me. Find a new life.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.270
- Take the handcuffs off.
- I can't do that.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.430
He's in a cell in the most
secure building in Aden

13:13.480 --> 13:16.241
with the British Army guarding him
and you need to keep his hands tied

13:16.280 --> 13:19.390
so he can't hug his wife?!

13:19.440 --> 13:21.920
What kind of man are you?

13:55.120 --> 13:59.310
Just tell the truth and
everything will be all right.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.080
There. That's what I loved about you.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.990
Such uncomplicated innocence.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.710
Here's Honor, as she is,
as she always will be.

14:14.760 --> 14:19.790
Loved? You said "loved".

14:19.840 --> 14:24.590
Love.
- Then that's enough. Everything's unpicked by love

14:24.640 --> 14:29.080
and the truth isn't frightened
of anything or anyone.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.830
It's not that simple,

14:32.880 --> 14:36.160
I'm not that simple.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.830
There's something you don't
know about my past, Honor...

14:40.880 --> 14:43.280
Shhh. Not now?

14:46.960 --> 14:49.800
I brought the film to Martha.
I've seen the photographs.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.080
Honor... Why didn't you destroy it?

14:55.240 --> 14:57.270
I think it's because deep
down, you don't think

14:57.320 --> 14:59.520
that concealing the
truth can ever be right.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.320
Time's up!

15:13.960 --> 15:16.510
When my mother fell asleep
on the chair on a Sunday,

15:16.560 --> 15:20.510
my father would steal in
and allow himself to go back

15:20.560 --> 15:26.790
to their beginnings and whispered
to her, "When you are old and grey"

15:26.840 --> 15:31.110
"and full of sleep, and
nodding by the fire,

15:31.160 --> 15:35.430
"take down this book, and slowly read,

15:35.480 --> 15:38.070
"and dream of the soft
look your eyes had once,

15:38.120 --> 15:42.510
"and of their shadows deep."

15:42.560 --> 15:47.910
"How many loved your
moments of glad grace,"

15:47.960 --> 15:53.270
"and loved your beauty
with love false and true,"

15:53.320 --> 15:56.080
"but one man loved the
pilgrim soul in you."

16:03.320 --> 16:05.280
Look at me.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.880
Hold on to love for dear life, Joe.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.600
When you have it.

16:58.800 --> 17:04.270
So an accused is, erm, well, he's
allowed someone alongside him

17:04.319 --> 17:10.790
to talk to, to take advice from,
to cross examine witnesses for,

17:10.839 --> 17:12.030
as a kind of pal, you know,

17:12.079 --> 17:14.240
so, well, they call it
an officer's friend.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.230
Did you know that?

17:20.280 --> 17:22.750
I did what I did and I'd do it again.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.030
There's no advice to give.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.520
Do you know you almost sound as
if you think you deserve to be

17:26.560 --> 17:28.069
punished for this?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.950
It's very nice of you to offer
to be my... What's it called?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.710
My friend. I don't
really need your help...

17:33.760 --> 17:36.150
Yeah, well, you don't
have a choice, I'm afraid,

17:36.200 --> 17:37.710
cos you saved my life.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.230
Yeah, a life for a life.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.390
I was dead, Joe. I was dead on that road.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.030
They told me at the hospital.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.590
I had minutes left to
live when you came for me.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.150
You dragged me back from the edge.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.510
I can't imagine where you got
the courage and the strength.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.720
- So where's your fight now?
- I have to plead guilty.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.320
What about Honor?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.950
Well, do you feel guilty?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.830
Because if you don't,
and you plead guilty,

18:07.880 --> 18:10.350
then you'll wake up the morning
after you've been sentenced

18:10.400 --> 18:12.750
you're going to look at the
wall of your cell and you'll

18:12.800 --> 18:16.190
know that there is nothing you can
do in the rest of your life that

18:16.240 --> 18:20.680
will correct the mistake you made
in not being honest with yourself.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.640
I'm not sure you'll survive, Joe.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.470
There's no defence, is there?

18:38.520 --> 18:42.590
Why don't we trust in the moral
high ground being a good place

18:42.640 --> 18:44.360
to defend oneself?

18:46.600 --> 18:52.160
Bang! Bang! You're dead.
I've got you now. You...

18:54.440 --> 18:56.510
What would happen if you said no?

18:56.560 --> 19:00.000
What if you told them you
wouldn't give evidence?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.920
Then my career would be over.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.440
I see.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.560
Bang! Bang! You're dead,
you're dead, you're dead!

20:47.360 --> 20:49.680
You can't stay with me.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.560
It's not safe.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.640
I saw your house.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.080
Your whole family.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.640
I thought you were dead.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.030
I wanted to die.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.480
I thought I'd never see you again, I...

21:26.920 --> 21:28.720
I'm never leaving you.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.750
Jesus Christ.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.070
Sorry. Hello. I, I was just...

22:13.120 --> 22:15.470
The door was open?

22:15.520 --> 22:18.030
- Yes.
- Were the lights on?

22:18.080 --> 22:21.530
What? II think so.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.890
And the fan? Did you turn that on?

22:24.940 --> 22:26.080
No.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.250
I'm sure...

22:32.400 --> 22:33.400
Laundry.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.110
I didn't send any.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.230
Shall I put it away?

22:36.280 --> 22:39.160
Just leave it! Thanks.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.930
Last time I was here,
I saw Harvey Tilbrook.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.060
He lied to me.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.640
- What about?
- Seeing you.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.670
Why would he do that?

23:03.720 --> 23:06.310
I don't know.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.960
But I saw him talking to
a man in the hotel lobby.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.520
Who?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.760
There's nothing to worry about.
Prosecution have got it all in hand.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.060
I'll have the glass, you have the bottle.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.000
Other way round, maybe, sir?

23:49.040 --> 23:50.780
It's court in the morning.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.540
So, why are you here?

24:10.520 --> 24:12.840
If your job were one thing...

24:15.040 --> 24:18.680
if being a sergeant in the British
Army boiled down to one thing...?

24:20.520 --> 24:24.640
Knowing my officers and my men
better than they know themselves.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.120
- Captain Martin?
- Is a good man.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.190
Major Markham?

24:42.240 --> 24:44.560
Doesn't need to ask his
sergeant what to do.

25:52.980 --> 25:53.980
Hut!

26:08.700 --> 26:09.700
Hut!

26:11.640 --> 26:12.780
Hut!

26:19.360 --> 26:20.880
All sit.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.550
Remove head dress.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.920
Yes, Mr Bishop.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.990
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence

26:39.040 --> 26:44.560
I give shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.

26:49.280 --> 26:53.550
Who gave Captain Martin
the order to escort Kadir?

26:53.600 --> 26:56.310
- I did.
- Personally? Directly?

26:56.360 --> 26:57.670
Yes.

26:57.720 --> 27:01.630
Did you later discover whether
the order had been carried out?

27:01.680 --> 27:03.030
Yes.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.120
And had it?

27:06.640 --> 27:10.320
Was the order carried out, Major Markham?

27:15.840 --> 27:17.720
No.

27:23.760 --> 27:24.950
What would you have done?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.790
If you had been in Captain Martin's shoes?

27:27.840 --> 27:31.030
What if it was his son that
was being held hostage,

27:31.080 --> 27:36.870
sentenced to die, clock ticking down
and you had the chance to save him,

27:36.920 --> 27:39.880
what would you do? Your duty?

27:41.920 --> 27:43.960
His child?

27:46.240 --> 27:49.110
My duty.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.030
Thank you, Major.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.710
And if it were your own child?

27:53.760 --> 27:55.750
Abraham was prepared to kill his own son

27:55.800 --> 27:58.430
because God demanded it of
him and what about you, sir?

27:58.480 --> 28:03.600
If the Army demanded it of you,
would it be the right thing?

28:05.880 --> 28:07.520
Erm...

28:10.200 --> 28:11.910
No, it wouldn't. I'm sorry.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.790
This is all hypothetical.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.590
Well, if this officer, whom everyone
describes as the best, the most

28:17.640 --> 28:21.590
upstanding of men, tells us that
there are circumstances in which it

28:21.640 --> 28:26.470
is right to disobey an order, then
it proves the possibility exists.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.750
A principle is starting to be established.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.470
Disobeying an order can
be the right thing to do.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.630
I don't agree. Law and
morality are the same thing.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.550
- What, in Nazi Germany?
- This is not Nazi Germany.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.830
Or at Amritsar.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.430
Would you have shot those 600
defenceless men, women and children

28:43.480 --> 28:47.590
because your commanding officer
asked you to do it, Brigadier?

28:47.640 --> 28:49.910
The question's not a rhetorical one, sir.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.910
It is impertinent!

28:51.960 --> 28:54.870
If my CO's moral map has
room in it for conscience,

28:54.920 --> 28:57.710
then this is not a
strict liability offence.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.480
I, I'd like to say something.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.630
When I gave the order to Captain Martin,

29:05.680 --> 29:07.560
my son was missing.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.080
I believed then that
he was certain to die.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.070
And the end of his life
felt like the end of my life.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.430
Every decision I have made
as a commanding officer,

29:23.480 --> 29:26.710
every order I have given has
been done so with the deep care

29:26.760 --> 29:33.480
that the privilege of commanding the
best soldiers in the world asks for.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.840
Major...
- However, when I gave that order to Captain Martin...

29:44.280 --> 29:45.990
I was not fit to do so.

29:46.040 --> 29:51.040
I was unfit to command my men. I'm sorry.

30:37.760 --> 30:43.030
In interview, you were asked if
you disobeyed an order? Did you?

30:43.080 --> 30:46.710
Yes, morally it was the only choice.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.280
Yes, the moral man.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.030
Where were you on the
afternoon of Christmas Day?

30:54.080 --> 30:55.590
I had work to see to.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.950
What kind of work?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.190
An interview.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.110
On Christmas Day?

31:00.160 --> 31:02.510
- Yes.
- Who were you interviewing?

31:02.560 --> 31:05.390
- A reporter.
- Name?

31:05.440 --> 31:06.950
Martha Franklin.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.680
In the office?

31:09.880 --> 31:11.960
- No.
- Somewhere else on the base?

31:16.480 --> 31:17.830
In a bar.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.990
On Christmas day?

31:20.040 --> 31:22.110
Yes.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.560
Did you tell your wife that you were
going off to meet a woman in a bar?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.950
- Not exactly.
- Well, yes or no?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.750
Not exactly.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.430
You're going to have to explain
that answer for those of us

31:33.480 --> 31:36.910
who believe the truth
to be a simple concept.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.030
What the truth is or
appears to be always depends

31:39.080 --> 31:41.030
on who's looking at it, wouldn't you say?

31:41.080 --> 31:44.000
Did you tell your wife where
you were going? Yes or no.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.870
No.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.310
When did you next see Martha Franklin?

31:51.360 --> 31:52.510
The next day.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.110
- Boxing day?
- Yes.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.750
Same bar?

31:55.800 --> 31:59.030
- No.
- Where?

31:59.080 --> 32:01.190
The Gordon Hotel.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.990
In the lobby?

32:03.040 --> 32:05.480
- No.
- In the bar?

32:07.160 --> 32:08.630
I wanted to explain...

32:08.680 --> 32:13.240
No, no, where did you meet for
your interview, Captain Martin?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.550
In her room.

32:24.720 --> 32:28.120
Are you a moral man, Captain Martin?

32:38.280 --> 32:41.630
It's over, isn't it? I'm going down.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.470
Honor.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.670
What?

32:45.720 --> 32:50.030
I want them to hear her talk about you.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.590
I'm not going to put her through that.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.440
That'd be up to her.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.670
It's fine.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.710
I can hide.

34:18.760 --> 34:22.030
But with a British soldier
beside me, it's not possible.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.830
You must go.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.400
No.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.199
If you love me, if you want
me to be safe, you have to go.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.760
CocaCola, please. Ice, no lemon.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.750
It's up to you what I drink?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.920
You're a guest.

35:06.120 --> 35:12.510
- Sometimes you forget, you people.
- The interview has to be in English.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.750
Kadir's English is better than my Arabic.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.190
You don't make the conditions.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.190
If it's not in English,
I won't agree to it.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.790
So, you see, I do.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.350
Western arrogance.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.350
No. A reporter's rules.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.550
How do we know we can trust you?

35:29.600 --> 35:32.910
You don't. I'll write whatever I like.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.150
I mean, how do we know we can trust you,

35:35.200 --> 35:36.870
not to bring the British Army with you?

35:36.920 --> 35:38.640
Well, you don't know that either.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.990
Except it would go against everything

35:42.040 --> 35:43.920
I believe in as a reporter.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.510
These are just words.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.400
What else is there?

36:05.200 --> 36:07.400
He did the right thing,
for honest reasons.

36:08.760 --> 36:12.680
My husband's a good man. I know he is.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.760
Thank you.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.510
How long have you been married?

36:26.560 --> 36:27.710
Nine weeks.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.030
And before you were married,
how long had you known him?

36:30.080 --> 36:33.670
Not long. We, erm, we
met on Valentine's day.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.720
- How romantic.
- Yes.

36:36.880 --> 36:43.030
How much do you know about
his life before he met you?

36:43.080 --> 36:47.160
Does the name Valerie
Cotton mean anything to you?

36:49.200 --> 36:50.830
No.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.150
Really? Nothing?

36:53.200 --> 36:59.990
She drowned herself a week after
writing a letter to your husband.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.680
My goodness.

37:02.880 --> 37:08.790
The letter says, "I love you."

37:08.840 --> 37:11.470
"I will leave my husband and my children"

37:11.520 --> 37:13.350
"if you promise to be with me."

37:13.400 --> 37:16.950
"If you don't make the
promise, I cannot live."

37:17.000 --> 37:19.950
She received no reply.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.360
You really don't know about this, do you?

37:43.560 --> 37:44.950
Sorry?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.040
Did you meet him at a dance?

37:49.680 --> 37:51.230
Yes.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.280
Is he a good dancer?

37:54.440 --> 37:57.630
Erm... Yes.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.470
That's about all you can say, isn't it?

37:59.520 --> 38:04.080
Concerning the character of your
husband? "He's a good dancer."

38:07.520 --> 38:09.310
Thank you, Mr Bishop,

38:09.360 --> 38:12.120
court will resume at ten
o'clock tomorrow morning.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.720
Martha?

40:07.080 --> 40:11.160
CocaCola... ice, no lemon.

40:19.720 --> 40:24.270
- Shall we begin?
- Yusra's family.

40:24.320 --> 40:29.350
- Was that you?
- We kill people who betray us.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.240
You cannot win... militarily.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.870
You see, Britain,

40:36.920 --> 40:40.270
deep down, is very ashamed of Empire.

40:40.320 --> 40:45.190
She doesn't want to be
seen talking of her shame,

40:45.240 --> 40:51.360
- but she feels it nonetheless.
- Are you talking to them? - Yes.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.840
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.630
Go on.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.870
Why not carry on negotiations?

41:04.920 --> 41:07.830
Why wreck it all by telling a journalist?

41:07.880 --> 41:14.350
It's very simple... true
independence is not given away,

41:14.400 --> 41:16.560
it's taken.

41:17.680 --> 41:20.640
You want me to write a
story about secret talks?

41:22.000 --> 41:26.430
People in Britain need
to confront their shame.

41:26.480 --> 41:29.480
I'm thinking about Great
Britain as well as Aden.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.270
The benevolent terrorist.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.190
Now, Miss Franklin.

41:36.240 --> 41:41.200
What is this word? Is Mandela a terrorist?

41:42.520 --> 41:45.630
Kenyatta? Nehru?

41:45.680 --> 41:51.240
And, anyway, the British government,
they don't talk to terrorists.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.950
Most certainly not about
handing over of power to them.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.990
You're using me to expose the hypocrisy.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.750
Absolutely.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.790
Who have you met with?

42:04.840 --> 42:08.400
A very distinguished and rare old bird.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.520
The Minister for Colonies.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.910
How can I verify this?

42:19.960 --> 42:24.830
Your laundry is back in
your drawer, your fan is off,

42:24.880 --> 42:28.630
the light on your desk is off,
and the photographs destroyed.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.280
You've been spying on me.

42:36.440 --> 42:38.280
Not us.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.200
What are you doing here?

42:56.880 --> 42:59.830
I don't have time to talk.

42:59.880 --> 43:03.760
I have to write a story
and it has to be now.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.870
You look terrible.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
Joe has a past I didn't know about.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.350
You found out?

43:15.400 --> 43:17.160
In court.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.800
Barristers are bullies.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.120
We all have secrets, Honor.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.680
Apart from you.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.950
They think that by telling me
something I don't know about Joe,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.080
they'll turn me away from him.

43:49.520 --> 43:53.550
They're wrong. I love him
and I don't know him,

43:53.600 --> 43:57.390
but both things can be true.

43:57.440 --> 43:58.920
Right?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.680
It's the first one that matters.

44:10.120 --> 44:13.830
- I thought you might be dead.
- Ha! Why?

44:13.880 --> 44:16.870
Well, because without the
photographs, it all depends on you.

44:16.920 --> 44:21.270
I have a story to write. It's
the biggest of my career.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.400
Then Joe will go to prison.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.030
What is it that you said?

44:29.080 --> 44:32.120
The... the little man has to
pay the price... every time.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.120
What are you doing?

44:52.760 --> 44:54.640
Whitehall, London, please.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.430
Martha Franklin, Washington Post.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.150
Can you put me through to
the Minister of Colonies?

45:03.200 --> 45:06.190
Just a few questions.

45:06.240 --> 45:11.350
He's... He's overseas?

45:11.400 --> 45:14.000
He's in London.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.960
Thanks.

45:32.160 --> 45:35.000
This is the man you saw
talking to Tilbrook.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.960
Officially, he's not here.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.270
You know what they say at Sandhurst?

45:53.320 --> 45:56.280
If you can't see your face in
your shoes, they're not ready.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.990
And can you?

46:47.280 --> 46:48.910
Sir.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.390
Something for you.

46:51.440 --> 46:54.150
Sir. What is it?

46:54.200 --> 46:55.840
Redemption.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.120
What about the German cars?

47:11.000 --> 47:15.510
- You're home early.
- I thought I could take George swimming.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.040
Yay! Swimming!

47:23.240 --> 47:27.070
- Colin Calvert. Cabinet Minister.
- Yes, that's him.

47:27.120 --> 47:31.150
That's the man I was
taking to The Gordon Hotel.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.750
His code name's Owl.

47:33.800 --> 47:36.110
There, Owl. Date, time.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.110
Pick up 12:55 hours, delivery 13:30.

47:40.160 --> 47:43.190
Coordinates eight,
eight, four, triple one.

47:43.240 --> 47:46.830
No. That can't be right.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.680
Triple one?

47:49.880 --> 47:52.670
I remember that. That's
where I was taking Kadir.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.830
Starfish.

47:54.880 --> 47:57.110
Starfish and Owl.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.110
The Minister was here to
meet with the terrorists.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.030
The Government have
been talking to the men

48:02.080 --> 48:04.190
who would have killed George Markham.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.840
I know you've been talking with Kadir.

48:13.960 --> 48:17.670
I know the distinguished Cabinet
Minister is in Aden to hold

48:17.720 --> 48:21.350
secret talks with the leader
of a terrorist organization

48:21.400 --> 48:23.830
who kidnap small children.

48:23.880 --> 48:28.550
I know his people in London are
lying about his whereabouts.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.910
I know all this, because there is a
military logbook that verifies it.

48:32.960 --> 48:36.550
And I know just how
embarrassing all this would be

48:36.600 --> 48:39.110
if I were to publish it.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.600
What would the headlines be?

48:43.920 --> 48:46.000
There'd be no story.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.040
You'd give up your story.

49:10.800 --> 49:12.840
Mr Bishop.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.270
After much careful consideration,
the Crown has taken the view that

49:17.320 --> 49:20.230
there are now compelling reasons
why it is not in the interests

49:20.280 --> 49:25.310
of justice or the national interest
to pursue this prosecution further.

49:27.880 --> 49:29.360
What's he saying?

49:30.920 --> 49:33.080
He's saying you're a free man.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.880
All rise.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.710
What?

51:59.760 --> 52:01.830
Kiss.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.720
Well...

52:36.760 --> 52:38.200
I've done everything I can.

52:41.440 --> 52:44.430
There's just one more thing.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.750
No, two.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.280
What?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.550
I'm thinking about leaving the
Army. I don't think it helps us

52:55.600 --> 52:57.470
to be fighting all the
rules all the time...

52:57.520 --> 52:59.000
It helps them.

53:01.600 --> 53:02.950
What?

53:03.000 --> 53:05.230
The Army.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.560
It's good for the British
Army to have you in it.

53:10.760 --> 53:14.990
It's what you were doing in court...

53:15.040 --> 53:16.790
Saving Joe Martin,

53:16.840 --> 53:19.760
and making them think very
hard about what they should be.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.960
They need you.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.320
What was the second thing?

53:32.480 --> 53:34.000
No.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.240
Ed.

53:41.960 --> 53:44.190
Nothing.

53:44.240 --> 53:46.200
What?

53:49.040 --> 53:50.920
I'd leave you.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.760
If it would make you happier...

53:56.880 --> 53:58.950
I'd go.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.080
How do I look?

54:18.680 --> 54:20.510
You look terrible, awful.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.360
Thank you, darling.

54:25.600 --> 54:27.600
I love it when you call me darling.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.560
What do you mean "terrible"?

55:03.280 --> 55:04.630
- No!
- Come here!

55:06.180 --> 55:07.180
I've got you!

55:10.360 --> 55:12.120
They lied to us.

55:13.960 --> 55:18.790
They lied and they lied,

55:18.840 --> 55:21.360
the world upside down.

55:28.560 --> 55:32.830
And then you did the right thing, Harry.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.160
And the world righted itself.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.360
Go out there, inspect your men.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.190
Tony! Come! The sun is going down.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.630
- Quick!
- Yeah, wait, Yusra!

56:06.680 --> 56:08.400
Quick, come!

56:21.440 --> 56:25.480
No, no. Yusra! Yusra! No, Yusra!

56:27.040 --> 56:31.280
No, no, no, no, no, Yusra!

56:33.680 --> 56:38.590
No, Yusra, no, stay with me! Stay with me!

56:38.640 --> 56:40.400
Can you hear me?!

56:44.240 --> 56:47.600
No, no, no.

56:51.040 --> 56:55.000
Where are you?! Where are you?!

56:56.120 --> 56:57.830
Show yourselves!

56:57.880 --> 57:00.190
Shoot me!

57:00.240 --> 57:02.590
Come on, kill me!

57:02.640 --> 57:04.510
Kill me! Shoot me!

57:04.560 --> 57:06.630
Show yourself, you fucking coward!

57:06.680 --> 57:09.270
Shoot me! Kill me!

57:12.080 --> 57:14.200
Shoot me!

57:17.240 --> 57:18.840
Kill me!

57:21.040 --> 57:22.720
Shoot me!

57:31.600 --> 57:35.430
When you join this regiment,
you commit yourself to working

57:35.480 --> 57:37.920
and fighting for Queen and Country.

57:39.600 --> 57:43.110
But these are nothing, compared
with the deep understanding that

57:43.160 --> 57:49.390
when we stand together, as we
do today, it is with the certain

57:49.440 --> 57:53.590
knowledge that the man you
stand next to will die for you,

57:53.640 --> 57:56.190
and that you will die for him...

57:56.240 --> 57:59.630
And that is the promise
by which we all live.

57:59.680 --> 58:02.400
Squad, by the left!

58:03.560 --> 58:05.200
Dismiss!

58:19.760 --> 58:21.560
Come on, Armstrong.
