00:01.914 --> 00:02.959
[instrumental music]

00:04.091 --> 00:06.484
[bell ringing]

00:14.536 --> 00:17.191
High school, huh? Must bring
back some memories for you.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.583
Friday nights,
your friends from band

00:18.670 --> 00:20.542
strapping on
those funny hats.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.457
You know what?
I am not gonna take the bait.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.763
And then after practice,
a little spin the bottle..

00:24.850 --> 00:27.070
in some wood paneled
rec room.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.767
Whatever you say.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.034
Rigsby,
what have we got?

00:34.121 --> 00:36.645
JackMcTierney, 28.
English teacher.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.168
ME, puts the time of death

00:38.255 --> 00:40.475
between 6 o'clock
and 9 o'clock last night.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.259
Apparently he likes to
stay late and go jogging

00:42.346 --> 00:43.913
around the campus.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.306
Cho's searching
his locker now.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.134
[sighs]

00:47.221 --> 00:48.700
Looks like it's a blunt-force
trauma to the head.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.050
'We have a murder weapon?'

00:50.137 --> 00:51.790
No, but the ME thinks
it was metal.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.749
When we got here, there were
bats in the equipment bins.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.098
We're testing them
for blood now.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.404
Did we contact the family?

00:56.491 --> 00:57.448
Yeah, but they're all
back East.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.797
He's single,
lives alone.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.582
Alright, start setting
up interviews

01:00.669 --> 01:02.540
'anybody who was here between
6:00 and 9:00 last night.'

01:02.627 --> 01:04.151
You got it.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.153
Look at that bruising
around the eye.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.156
Mm. It's faded. Looks like
it's about a week old.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.723
Be good to know
how that happened.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.899
Well, let's ask
the principal.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.553
That guy?

01:15.640 --> 01:18.948
Cheap power suit, phone holster,
Bluetooth, large watch.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.776
Has petty tyrant
written all over him.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.647
Excuse me! Sir?

01:22.734 --> 01:24.693
Hi. I'm Agent Lisbon.
This is Patrick Jane.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.173
We're with the CBI.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.131
Principal Carl Snyder.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.047
Thank you so much
for coming so quickly.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.354
Uh, did Mr. McTierney
have any problems?

01:33.441 --> 01:34.398
Trouble with a student?

01:34.485 --> 01:35.486
No, I don't think so.

01:35.573 --> 01:36.879
He was a great teacher.

01:36.966 --> 01:39.142
He started working here
right after college.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.144
Uh, bright kid.
Could have made money

01:41.231 --> 01:43.233
doing so many things,
but he loved teaching.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.148
We were lucky to have him.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.977
Now I have a
grief counseling session

01:48.064 --> 01:49.892
- starting momentarily--
- Excellent. We'll come.

01:49.979 --> 01:53.069
Uh, how did he get
the black eye?

01:53.156 --> 01:55.593
He said that he,
was playing basketball

01:55.680 --> 01:56.812
with some students
after school.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.466
But you didn't believe him?

01:58.553 --> 02:00.032
Well, why would he lie?
Of course I believed him.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.382
No, you didn't.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.123
Well, why would Ilie?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.994
Probably just
bureaucratic instinct.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.735
Now if you suspected
that the black eye story

02:06.822 --> 02:09.520
was false, did you have
any notion of the true story?

02:09.607 --> 02:11.261
- No.
- Hmm?

02:11.348 --> 02:13.742
Like I said, he was very
popular among everyone

02:13.829 --> 02:15.352
students and faculty alike.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.224
Not everyone. I went
through McTierney's locker.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.704
Nothing unusual. But I found
this in his briefcase.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.274
[instrumental music]

02:26.276 --> 02:28.365
Oh. This is
very interesting.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.456
I had the honor of working
with Jack McTierney

02:32.543 --> 02:34.197
for the past five years.

02:34.284 --> 02:35.807
He was a good teacher.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.202
And he will be missed.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.813
Thank you, Mr. Loveland.

02:41.900 --> 02:46.383
Now is there anyone else who
would like to say something

02:46.470 --> 02:47.863
about Mr. McTierney?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.262
We-well, I'd-I'd
like to say something.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.918
Mr. Jane, this is a very
sensitive moment.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.443
Yeah, they're just teenagers.
They'll get over it.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.575
[Patrick clears throat]

03:04.662 --> 03:06.577
Good morning, everyone.
I'm Patrick Jane.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.666
I'm with the CBI.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.016
I'm sorry for
everyone's loss. Uh..

03:11.103 --> 03:12.670
I know you were close
to Mr. McTierney

03:12.757 --> 03:14.933
and I was hoping
that one of you could tell me

03:15.020 --> 03:17.240
who wrote this letter
that we found.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.763
[rustling]

03:21.636 --> 03:22.593
"Dear Mr. McT..

03:22.680 --> 03:24.291
[sighs]

03:24.378 --> 03:26.423
'"I saw what you did,
and I'm disgusted.'

03:26.510 --> 03:30.340
'"You are a total pig."
Exclamation point.'

03:30.427 --> 03:32.255
"I used to think
you were special

03:32.342 --> 03:34.562
"but you're just a hypocrite
like the rest of them.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.001
"I can't believe I ever
thought you were cool.

03:40.263 --> 03:41.438
'"I hate you."'

03:41.525 --> 03:42.787
[murmuring]

03:42.874 --> 03:46.574
'Who would write
such a letter? Hmm?'

03:46.661 --> 03:48.489
Clearly someone
who felt betrayed.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.623
A sensitive soul who now
feels deep remorse

03:52.710 --> 03:55.060
for having spoken so harshly.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.717
Someone seated right here
in this room.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.197
Yes.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.809
[murmuring]

04:04.896 --> 04:07.029
You.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.509
While everyone else
was looking around

04:08.596 --> 04:09.814
trying to figure out
who wrote the letter

04:09.901 --> 04:11.425
'you weren't.'

04:11.512 --> 04:12.948
You knew who wrote
the letter

04:13.035 --> 04:14.689
because it was you.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.734
Isn't that right?

04:16.821 --> 04:19.302
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.912
Oh, Lisbon, you're on.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.174
[murmuring]

04:22.262 --> 04:23.306
Wow.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.873
Hey! Hey, stop!

04:27.092 --> 04:28.529
Drama, huh?

04:30.313 --> 04:32.272
Anyone else have
anything to say?

04:33.447 --> 04:35.840
[theme music]

04:43.718 --> 04:44.980
Why'd you write
this letter, Rachel?

04:45.067 --> 04:47.199
[sniffling]
Mr. McT was my favorite teacher.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.596
He always talked about
self-respect.

04:52.683 --> 04:56.905
'He wanted us girls to
value ourselves for our minds.'

04:56.992 --> 04:58.820
I-I mean, he was cool
with us.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.822
He didn't treat us
like idiot kids.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.389
Well, what changed?

05:02.476 --> 05:03.868
Three nights ago,
I was driving

05:03.955 --> 05:05.827
to the food bank
where I volunteer.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.698
It's in kind of
a sketchy neighborhood.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.877
And I saw Mr. McTierney
talking to, like, a hooker.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.925
And they were fighting.
Well, arguing.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.753
'And then she got
into his car.'

05:18.840 --> 05:21.364
I mean..
He's a teacher.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.280
What did she look like?

05:24.367 --> 05:25.760
Here. I took a picture.

05:25.847 --> 05:26.978
[sniffles]

05:31.287 --> 05:33.550
[phone ringing]
Text me that picture

05:33.637 --> 05:35.857
and the address that you
saw her. Excuse me.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.075
Cho, what's up?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.860
[Kimball]
'Forensics finished up.'

05:38.947 --> 05:40.601
None of the school's bats
show traces of blood.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.124
And we found a baggie
of homemade pills

05:42.211 --> 05:45.257
in McTierney's car.
Looks like MDMA. Ecstasy.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.216
[Teresa]
'Turns out our victim
had a few secrets.'

05:47.303 --> 05:48.826
I've got a student here
who says she saw him

05:48.913 --> 05:50.654
in an argument
with a prostitute.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.787
I'll forward you a picture
of the hooker and the address.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.745
'You and Rigsby see
if you can track her down.'

05:54.832 --> 05:56.660
Got it.

05:56.747 --> 05:57.835
[beeping]

05:59.402 --> 06:00.360
Jane?

06:00.447 --> 06:01.796
Hey.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.930
Hmm? Ecstasy.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.368
Interesting.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.892
[door opens]

06:10.979 --> 06:13.895
No, you go on.
I'm gonna stay here.

06:15.766 --> 06:16.811
bye.

06:16.898 --> 06:19.291
I'm sorry. May I help you?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.816
No. No help necessary.
Uh, you are?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.818
Ms. Austin.
Uh, drama teacher.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.733
Ah, I was just admiring
your set.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.256
Uh, what play are you doing?

06:27.343 --> 06:28.518
"Hamlet."

06:28.605 --> 06:31.303
A modern interpretation,
as you can see.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.262
"To die, to sleep.

06:33.349 --> 06:36.265
"To sleep,
perchance to dream.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.441
"Ay, there's the rub."

06:38.528 --> 06:40.312
That's right.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.794
I'm, uh, worried
about Rachel.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.668
She's in the play.
She's really a good kid.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.017
Oh, she'll be fine

06:49.104 --> 06:50.410
unless she murdered
Mr. McT.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.934
- What do you think?
- No.

06:53.021 --> 06:55.110
No. Uh.. I can't imagine.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.372
Hmm.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.201
[laughing]

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
[chuckles]

07:00.898 --> 07:03.684
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have five minutes

07:03.771 --> 07:06.121
to get bad coffee
from the teachers' lounge.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.384
Mmm. Enjoy.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.170
[whooshing]

07:15.565 --> 07:16.697
[whooshing]

07:18.438 --> 07:19.569
[grunting]

07:21.266 --> 07:24.182
[instrumental music]

07:34.932 --> 07:36.064
[whooshing]

07:38.283 --> 07:39.894
[tapping]

07:39.981 --> 07:41.112
En garde.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.596
Well, it's no fun
if you just give up.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.079
Are you one of the cops?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.560
Cop-adjacent, maybe.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.649
- Are you in the play?
- Yeah, I am.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.000
I'm Jeremiah.
I play the ghost.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.392
"I am thy father's spirit

08:00.480 --> 08:03.265
"doomed for a certain term
to walk the night."

08:03.352 --> 08:05.789
Sounds cool when you say it.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.704
I'm not sure
I'm pulling it off.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.968
I only auditioned
to meet the girls.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.448
How's that going for you?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.015
Not good.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.538
[sighs]

08:15.625 --> 08:18.585
Well, Jeremiah, you seem
like a fellow in the know.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.152
Let me ask you this.

08:21.239 --> 08:23.764
Where could I buy
some drugs around here?

08:23.851 --> 08:27.550
- What?
- Ecstasy, preferably.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.509
I have no idea.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.206
Wh-why would you ask?

08:31.293 --> 08:33.948
Uh, I want to meet
the bad kids.

08:34.035 --> 08:37.038
You know, the kind that might
sell drugs to a teacher.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.171
Every school has them.
Where do they hang out?

08:40.258 --> 08:43.087
Um, I wo.. I wouldn't know
where they hang out.

08:43.174 --> 08:46.526
Mm, the bad kids
keep real low profile.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
Principal Snyder's
kind of a hard-ass.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.704
Hmm. You wouldn't know, huh?

08:52.140 --> 08:53.707
Do you swear?

08:53.794 --> 08:56.361
Yeah. I swear.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.888
Well fought.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.846
Off with you.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.069
I know the due date's
just an estimate.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.680
But it.. I mean, it could be
today, right?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.640
Yea.. Just promise me that
you'll call or text.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.078
Sorry. Sarah's freaking out.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.776
- How are you doing?
- Yeah, good. Solid.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.952
Definitely not about
to have a heart attack.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.737
Hey.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.217
Hey, now, back it up.
I'm just waiting on my laundry.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.219
Laundry? In that outfit?

09:28.306 --> 09:29.699
What are you,
a fashion critic?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.875
We're looking for this girl.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.355
'You seen her?'

09:33.442 --> 09:34.617
I don't know.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.358
I lost my glasses.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.360
Maybe if I had some money
for a new pair.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.934
Now I see.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.370
That's like White Chenille.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.850
Usually works
over on Fremont.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.895
Thank you.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.549
But she won't be out yet.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.986
You know where she stays?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.075
Come on, honey.
We've been over this.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.951
[indistinct chatter]

10:11.611 --> 10:12.742
Hmm.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.267
[door opens]

10:19.575 --> 10:22.404
Nice bathroom, Luis.
Uh, very clean.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.058
Sorry?

10:24.145 --> 10:28.149
I was just saying, bathroom
it's, uh, spotless.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.368
Where are all the bad kids?

10:30.455 --> 10:33.023
Bad kids? I-I don't know.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.853
Okay. Yeah.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.291
Nice chatting with you.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.210
[dramatic music]

10:49.474 --> 10:50.650
[rattling]

10:51.389 --> 10:53.435
Hello?

10:53.522 --> 10:54.654
[rattling]

10:59.702 --> 11:01.661
Uh, wait!

11:01.748 --> 11:02.879
[slamming]

11:07.405 --> 11:09.494
Hello, Mr. Jane.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.279
I'm sorry, if I'd have known
you wanted to come down here

11:11.366 --> 11:12.672
I would have had Luis
escort you.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.064
Perhaps you can help me out.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.152
I'm trying to find
the delinquents.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.676
Well, I..

11:16.763 --> 11:19.548
Found one myself,
or at least his shoes

11:19.635 --> 11:22.464
but he managed to get away.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.292
I don't think they're
gonna help you much.

11:24.379 --> 11:27.861
Mr. McTierney taught
mostly advanced classes.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.994
Yes, but it's the bad apples
that have the real dirt.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.605
And where are they?

11:33.693 --> 11:37.218
During class,
the kids are in class.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.611
It's a revolutionary
concept, I know.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.830
[bell ringing]

11:41.744 --> 11:43.528
Well.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.052
If you'll excuse me,
that's lunch.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.054
Speaking of which,
I'm a little peckish.

11:47.141 --> 11:49.709
Where's the cafeteria?

11:49.796 --> 11:50.927
[sighs]

11:52.842 --> 11:55.018
- Yes?
- Are you Chenille?

11:55.105 --> 11:56.280
No. Who's Chenille?

11:56.367 --> 11:57.673
I'm Rigsby. This is Cho.
We're with CBI.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.153
Look, we know you go
by Chenille

11:59.240 --> 12:02.591
and your real name's
Lindy Hayes.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.158
Seems like you got it all
figured out.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.812
What do you need me for?

12:05.899 --> 12:07.291
You were with this man,
Jack McTierney

12:07.378 --> 12:08.684
three nights ago?

12:09.859 --> 12:12.035
Yeah, so what?
I see him a lot.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.950
So he was a regular
of yours?

12:14.037 --> 12:16.170
No. He was
my English teacher.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.086
What is this about?

12:21.871 --> 12:24.265
[indistinct chattering]

12:32.273 --> 12:33.840
Hey. Excuse me.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.929
Can I borrow this?

12:39.584 --> 12:40.803
Oh, dear.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.198
You can have that back.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.765
[all gasps]

12:45.852 --> 12:48.289
Excuse me. I just need
a moment of your time

12:48.376 --> 12:50.291
then you can get back
to your lunch.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.597
I'd like you all
to raise your hands.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.382
All of you.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.558
It's official police business.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.342
Raise them high.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.649
Put your hand down
if you're on the Dean's list.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.566
[indistinct chatter]

13:04.653 --> 13:05.785
[Patrick]
'Good.'

13:07.830 --> 13:10.485
Okay, good.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.400
'Now put your hand down
if you're taking the SATs'

13:13.923 --> 13:16.360
or planning to take
the SATs.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.146
Okay then.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.891
Put your hand down if you've
never smoked a cigar..

13:24.978 --> 13:26.762
'Never mind.'

13:26.849 --> 13:29.199
Carry on.
Enjoy your meat loaf.

13:30.287 --> 13:31.419
[indistinct chatter]

13:32.507 --> 13:33.813
[birds chirping]

13:40.254 --> 13:41.864
[groaning]

13:41.951 --> 13:44.171
[male #1]
'Here get him.'

13:44.258 --> 13:46.651
[indistinct chattering]

13:50.351 --> 13:51.482
[grunting]

13:54.268 --> 13:55.660
[rustling]

13:55.747 --> 13:57.010
[male #2]
What was that?

13:57.097 --> 13:58.359
Ahh!

13:58.446 --> 14:00.665
Bad kids, at last!

14:00.752 --> 14:02.667
Uhh! No need to run.
Don't even think about it.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.539
The place is surrounded.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.150
Snipers on the rooftops.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.761
Just kidding. Who's running
the show here, you?

14:09.849 --> 14:10.980
Or..

14:15.767 --> 14:17.552
You.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.771
What do you want?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.426
I'm Patrick.
What's your name?

14:22.513 --> 14:26.213
- Krista.
- Krista. I come in peace.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.910
So which of you crazy cats
is gonna help me

14:27.997 --> 14:31.522
solve McTierney's murder, huh?

14:31.609 --> 14:33.176
[Patrick]
Wow.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.656
[indistinct chattering]

14:34.743 --> 14:36.484
You really are bad.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.487
What do you wanna know?

14:39.574 --> 14:42.707
Well, while the rest of the kids
are stuck inside

14:42.794 --> 14:46.711
sharpening their pencils,
you're out here roaming free.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.845
I bet you know way more about
what's really going on, right?

14:49.932 --> 14:52.108
Like who's selling
the ecstasy, for starters.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.329
I wish I knew someone.
That would..

14:55.416 --> 14:57.331
That would definitely
be a popular kid.

14:57.418 --> 15:00.116
What about McTierney?
Did he have any secret vices?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.729
No. He was a square.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.688
Super clean-cut.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.995
Which is why it's so weird
he was tight with Loveland

15:09.082 --> 15:11.388
'cause Loveland's
a crazy drunk.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.608
Loveland?
The career counselor?

15:14.565 --> 15:15.653
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.873
See, a while back, um

15:17.960 --> 15:19.701
Loveland confiscated
my friend's cell phone.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.050
Mm-hmm.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.399
So my friend broke
into his office

15:22.486 --> 15:23.661
and found like a million
of those little

15:23.748 --> 15:25.881
vodka airplane bottles,
empty.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.232
Well, thanks, Krista.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.714
Very much.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.281
You know, when you wake up
tomorrow morning

15:34.368 --> 15:35.804
and you look in the mirror,
you will see yourself

15:35.891 --> 15:37.458
as if for the very first time,
and you will decide

15:37.545 --> 15:39.982
'to never smoke
cigarettes again.'

15:42.245 --> 15:44.639
[instrumental music]

15:46.946 --> 15:48.860
Thank..
Thank you.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.608
How did you know
Jack McTierney?

15:57.695 --> 15:59.784
He was my teacher.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.830
Like three years ago.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.571
Before I dropped out
of school.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.488
Back then,
he tried to help me

16:07.575 --> 16:10.621
with this problem I was having
with my stepfather.

16:10.708 --> 16:11.927
What was the problem?

16:13.929 --> 16:15.931
Take a wild guess.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.411
If your stepfather
was abusing you

16:17.498 --> 16:19.369
you can still have him
prosecuted.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.892
Whatever.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.808
I ran away to the city.
Problem solved.

16:23.895 --> 16:28.639
But I guess Mr. McTierney
felt guilty, or something.

16:28.726 --> 16:32.165
'Cause ever since then,
he's been trying to rescue me.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.906
He freaked when I told him
I was turning tricks.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.386
What did he say?

16:36.473 --> 16:38.606
You know, that I could still
have a normal life.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.696
Stuff like that.

16:41.783 --> 16:46.179
Then afterward, he'd come
to see me like once a week

16:46.266 --> 16:48.311
buy me a cup of coffee

16:48.398 --> 16:50.487
talk to me about getting
my GED.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.099
But I didn't want to hear it.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.883
So we fought.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.974
We found drugs on McTierney.
Ecstasy.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.586
Couldn't have been
his stuff.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.284
He was a total
straight arrow.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.068
Was it yours?

17:06.155 --> 17:07.983
Ecstasy?

17:08.070 --> 17:10.377
That's for amateurs.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.161
Do you know if he was having
any problems at school?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.426
I don't know.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.907
I mean, he had a couple
other projects like me.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.040
I guess one of them
could have gone wrong.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.606
Projects?

17:22.693 --> 17:25.566
You know, kids he was
trying to help.

17:25.653 --> 17:27.611
You got any names?

17:27.698 --> 17:31.833
He tried to keep that stuff
pretty private.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.228
But I heard him, arguing
on the phone with someone.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.230
'Martin.'

17:37.317 --> 17:40.233
Thanks.
You've been very helpful.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.756
L-let me know if I can
do anything else.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.717
I want to help..
For Mr. McTierney.

17:46.804 --> 17:49.372
If you want to help,
you should do what he wanted.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.200
Go back to school.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.118
[indistinct chattering]

18:00.383 --> 18:02.516
[bell ringing]

18:09.349 --> 18:13.396
Mr. Loveland.
You got a minute?

18:13.483 --> 18:14.919
Of course. Come in.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.747
Yeah. A-anything
I can do to help.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.968
Well, in that case, why did you
punch Mr. McTierney?

18:22.057 --> 18:24.103
How did you know that?

18:24.190 --> 18:27.584
Oh. Well, I-I didn't,
but you just told me.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.630
Also, drunk people
aren't really known

18:29.717 --> 18:31.240
for their impulse control.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.374
Hey. Perfectly
understandable.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.637
You're working with
overachieving children all day.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.030
Who wouldn't want
to take the edge off? Huh?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.945
Look. I know what you
must be thinking

18:41.032 --> 18:44.253
but I had eight years sober.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.995
And, my wife left me

18:47.082 --> 18:49.867
and w-we got a new principal,
and, well, I started thinking

18:49.954 --> 18:53.262
that a drink might
be a good idea.

18:53.349 --> 18:57.179
About a month ago,
I, uh...tested that theory.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.790
Mmm. How'd that go?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.705
Okay. For a while.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.709
Then I started drinking
before work

19:05.796 --> 19:07.581
and I realized that
I was out of control.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.278
You confided in McTierney.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.975
I thought I could trust him.
I was wrong.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.890
He told the principal.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.544
Yeah.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.329
He screwed me royally.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.679
Doesn't seem like something
McTierney would do.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.290
I know. But when I asked Snyder
for some time off

19:21.377 --> 19:23.597
he knew about the drinking.

19:23.684 --> 19:27.078
He couldn't fire me for it,
but he could make my life hell.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.041
Okay.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.130
[Patrick clears throat]

19:35.217 --> 19:37.437
Uh, wh-wh-where were you

19:37.524 --> 19:40.179
when you, uh, uh, told
McTierney you relapsed?

19:40.266 --> 19:41.876
W-we were in the men's room.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.573
Was there anyone else there?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.096
You think I'd be talking
about that kind of stuff

19:45.184 --> 19:46.141
if there were?

19:46.228 --> 19:47.534
No, of course not.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.014
Thank you.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.233
[bell ringing]

19:56.020 --> 19:57.805
- I take it no baby yet.
- 'No.'

19:57.892 --> 19:59.546
Got anything
to distract me?

19:59.633 --> 20:01.548
Well, we finally got into
McTierney's computer

20:01.635 --> 20:03.114
and looked at his calendar.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.725
He had an advisory meeting
scheduled with a kid

20:04.812 --> 20:06.727
named Martin Klubock
the night he died.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.294
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's weird.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.339
Martin's an 'A' student,
and he has no history

20:10.426 --> 20:11.993
of disciplinary action
at school.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.256
So why was he one of
Mr. McTierney's projects?

20:14.343 --> 20:15.736
Well..

20:15.823 --> 20:17.346
[sighs]
I looked into
his attendance records.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.392
He's been out sick
a bunch of times this year.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.089
And there was a trip
to the emergency room.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.438
A broken rib
and some stitches.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.092
You think it's
some kind of abuse?

20:24.179 --> 20:26.268
Could be, although his folks
don't have a record.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.183
Anyway, he called in sick
to school today.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.185
Yeah. Cho and I will
check it out. Gladly.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.275
That guilty creatures
sitting in a play

20:33.362 --> 20:36.974
have, by the, the
cunning of the scene

20:37.061 --> 20:39.586
so struck to the soul

20:39.673 --> 20:41.849
that presently..

20:41.936 --> 20:44.808
They have proclaimed
their malefactions

20:44.895 --> 20:46.506
their shortcomings.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.422
Mind if I borrow
some of this? Thank you.

20:49.509 --> 20:52.773
For murder,
though it have no tongue

20:52.860 --> 20:59.083
will speak with most,
magnificent organ.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.390
I'll have these players
play something

21:01.477 --> 21:04.567
like the murder of my father
before mine uncle.

21:04.654 --> 21:05.873
'If he but blench..'

21:08.963 --> 21:11.618
I-I know my course.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.054
- Line?
- Billy!

21:13.141 --> 21:14.490
We have been
over this.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.362
You should have been
off book a week ago.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.668
The spirit that
I have seen may be a devil

21:18.755 --> 21:22.237
and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape

21:22.324 --> 21:24.195
and so on and so forth.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.720
The play's the thing

21:26.807 --> 21:29.636
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.942
[Ms. Austin]
'That was amazing!'

21:32.029 --> 21:33.901
Are you an actor, Mr. Jane?

21:33.988 --> 21:38.166
Well, I've, done a little
stage work here and there.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.124
Wow!

21:40.211 --> 21:42.301
I hope you guys
were paying attention.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.347
Billy, did you hear
the passion

21:45.434 --> 21:48.350
and clarity of his delivery,
the, the rhythm?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.134
Yeah. I heard.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.746
Okay. Everybody take five

21:52.833 --> 21:57.098
while I try to find out
what happened with the programs.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.622
Well, maybe Mr. Jane
could give us a few tips.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.320
I'm sure Mr. Jane doesn't
want to be bothered

22:01.407 --> 22:02.712
with our little play.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.106
- Oh, it's no bother.
- 'Well, then..'

22:05.193 --> 22:07.064
A brilliant idea.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.328
It's not every day we get
a visit from a professional.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.331
In that case, let's warm up with
a simple enunciation exercise

22:12.418 --> 22:13.636
shall we?

22:13.723 --> 22:16.291
Toy boat, ten times, fast.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.424
- 'Toy boat.'
- Toy boat. Toy boat.

22:18.511 --> 22:21.209
[in unison]
Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.

22:21.296 --> 22:23.342
- Toy boat. Toy boat.
- 'Faster.'

22:25.126 --> 22:26.997
Jeremiah, you're not
projecting.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.521
Inhale from the bottom
of your stomach

22:28.608 --> 22:29.957
not from the top
of your throat.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.394
Deep breaths.

22:32.481 --> 22:35.179
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast--

22:35.266 --> 22:36.703
More voice, more voice.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.053
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast!

22:39.140 --> 22:41.055
[Ms. Austin]
'Yes!'

22:41.142 --> 22:44.406
Yes, bravo, Jeremiah!

22:45.451 --> 22:47.409
You are good, Mr. Jane.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.281
Any notes for Billy,
our Hamlet?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.283
Well, remember, Billy,
never break character

22:52.371 --> 22:53.546
even if you forget
your lines.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.851
I mean, the audience
will never know

22:54.938 --> 22:56.331
as long as you keep going.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.638
Thank you. I have been
telling him that.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.641
And Hamlet's not as pleased
with himself as you are

23:01.728 --> 23:04.208
so, uh, dial that back
a touch.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.863
As for you, Ms. Austin

23:06.950 --> 23:08.517
you have, uh..

23:09.910 --> 23:12.391
something on your...coat.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.958
'Huh. A leaf.'

23:16.525 --> 23:17.787
There. All set.

23:17.874 --> 23:21.138
Oh. Thank you, Mr. Jane.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.879
You should come back tomorrow
and see the play.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.316
I'm sure all the kinks
will be worked out by then.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.145
Yeah. Break a leg.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.973
- Martin Klubock?
- Uh, yes.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.453
I'm Agent Rigsby.
This is Agent Cho.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.237
We're with CBI.
Your parents home?

23:33.324 --> 23:34.891
Uh, no.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.154
No, they're at a sales
convention in Tucson.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.634
But they'll be back
Saturday.

23:38.721 --> 23:41.071
We need to talk to you
about Mr. McTierney.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.334
Yeah. Of course.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.032
You got something burning?

23:45.119 --> 23:47.643
Uh, no. No, it's fine.
It's just some soup.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.168
You had a meeting
with Mr. McTierney last night

23:51.255 --> 23:52.561
an hour before he died.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.563
Uh, I was supposed
to meet with him.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.260
Uh, but I canceled.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.914
I'm coming down
with something.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.394
Really, you got something
burning. I should check it out.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.266
- Uh, no, it's fine.
- No, come on! Hey! Hey!

24:07.924 --> 24:09.926
[hissing]
Hey!

24:10.013 --> 24:11.624
What the hell
are you doing?

24:11.711 --> 24:13.060
[bubbling]

24:16.367 --> 24:17.499
Making ecstasy.

24:19.675 --> 24:20.807
[bell ringing]

24:27.814 --> 24:30.686
[instrumental music]

24:46.876 --> 24:48.312
Et voila.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.450
[indistinct chattering]

24:55.537 --> 24:57.365
[woman over PA]
'Patrick Jane, please report'

24:57.452 --> 24:59.759
'to the principal's office
immediately.'

24:59.846 --> 25:03.197
'I repeat, Patrick Jane,
to the principal's office.'

25:06.635 --> 25:08.289
[door opens]

25:08.376 --> 25:10.421
There he is. The principal
will be in shortly.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.640
[sighs]

25:13.076 --> 25:14.817
What did you do?

25:15.992 --> 25:17.646
Nothing.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.256
11 years in catholic school

25:19.343 --> 25:21.694
and I never got sent to
the principal's office once.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.000
Well, that's because you're
a boring goody-two-shoes.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.741
I didn't say I never did
anything bad.

25:25.828 --> 25:28.527
- I just never got caught.
- Ahh. Touche.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.268
[door opens]

25:35.969 --> 25:37.100
[sighs]

25:41.540 --> 25:42.671
[sniffing]

25:47.328 --> 25:51.375
It has come to my attention

25:51.462 --> 25:54.248
'that Mr. Jane here'

25:54.335 --> 25:55.989
performed an act of vandalism

25:56.076 --> 25:58.644
in the second floor
boys restroom.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.691
A vicious, personal attack
on me.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.520
Jane?

26:07.740 --> 26:09.872
It's true.

26:09.959 --> 26:13.223
Sir, on behalf of the CBI,
I apologize.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.575
I appreciate that.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.969
Mr. Jane?

26:23.233 --> 26:24.408
Jane!

26:29.675 --> 26:32.808
I'm sorry for the senseless
act of graffiti.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.116
That's all.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.771
Very well.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.165
I will send a bill to CBI

26:42.252 --> 26:44.037
which will cover the cost
of cleaning

26:44.124 --> 26:46.256
and I would ask
that as we move forward

26:46.343 --> 26:48.911
with this investigation

26:48.998 --> 26:51.914
it is conducted without
Mr. Jane on site.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.655
Are we agreed?

26:53.742 --> 26:56.876
How'd you know it was me
that graffiti'd the bathroom?

26:56.963 --> 26:58.529
A student told me.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.358
Well, that's strange,
'cause it was during class

27:01.445 --> 27:03.578
and there was no one else
in the bathroom

27:03.665 --> 27:05.058
'cause I checked.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.016
Well, somebody saw something,
didn't they?

27:07.103 --> 27:08.322
Mmm.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.672
You saw something

27:10.759 --> 27:13.414
on your unauthorized
security cameras.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.156
What?

27:16.243 --> 27:17.897
He has unauthorized
security cameras

27:17.984 --> 27:19.812
hidden in the bathrooms.

27:19.899 --> 27:22.031
It's a little creepy, huh?

27:24.164 --> 27:25.774
'I don't know where
you are getting'

27:25.861 --> 27:28.081
your information,
but it is simply not true!

27:28.168 --> 27:30.257
Oh! Oh!

27:30.344 --> 27:31.432
[Patrick]
'Hello!'

27:31.519 --> 27:33.303
Pervy perv perv!

27:33.390 --> 27:35.175
Secret cameras?
That is profoundly illegal.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.699
No. Listen..

27:37.786 --> 27:40.006
Listen to me.

27:40.093 --> 27:44.924
These cameras are for
disciplinary purposes only.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.795
Then why didn't you
tell us?

27:46.882 --> 27:49.058
Because, as you say

27:49.145 --> 27:52.583
strictly speaking,
they are not 100% legal.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.629
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Principal Snyder'

27:54.716 --> 27:56.979
if you're withholding evidence
from this investigation

27:57.066 --> 27:58.677
we've got
a serious problem.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.201
'And the PTA
and the ACLU.'

28:01.288 --> 28:02.898
And all those other acronyms

28:02.985 --> 28:05.684
they're gonna have a host
of problems with you, pal.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.208
I wouldn't think
of withholding evidence.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.645
I'm not an idiot.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.082
I looked through the footage
the night of the murder

28:13.169 --> 28:15.215
and I don't think
there is anything there.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.608
Frankly, I don't care
what you think.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.481
'I want all the footage now.'

28:20.568 --> 28:22.352
Alright. I understand.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.355
[breathing heavily]

28:25.442 --> 28:28.445
Agent Lisbon,
could I ask that we

28:28.532 --> 28:30.230
keep this discreet?

28:30.317 --> 28:31.492
No.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.409
Martin..

28:37.193 --> 28:39.674
...you've been
manufacturing ecstasy

28:39.761 --> 28:41.067
a schedule I,
narcotic.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.332
You're 16 years old.

28:45.419 --> 28:46.942
You can be tried
as an adult

28:47.029 --> 28:48.509
or you can be tried
as a minor.

28:48.596 --> 28:52.034
Believe me, you don't want
to be tried as an adult.

28:52.121 --> 28:55.037
You lied about meeting
Mr. McTierney the night he died.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.344
Okay. I met him.

28:57.431 --> 28:58.693
And he confiscated
your pills?

28:58.780 --> 29:00.869
That's why we found
the drugs on him, right?

29:00.956 --> 29:03.742
Yeah. But he didn't know
I was making them. I swear.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.135
I told him
I found the pills

29:06.222 --> 29:07.484
and he believed me.

29:07.571 --> 29:10.052
What about your parents?
They must have known

29:10.139 --> 29:11.750
that there was
a drug lab in their basement.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.274
Uh, they had no idea
about the drugs.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.189
'I told them it was for
my science fair project.'

29:16.276 --> 29:17.843
Okay.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.454
So why were you meeting
Mr. McTierney?

29:22.064 --> 29:25.676
I had been having
some, trouble,and..

29:25.764 --> 29:27.504
'...he was trying to help me.'

29:29.289 --> 29:32.248
Something to do with your,
uh, trip to the emergency room?

29:34.163 --> 29:35.295
Yeah.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.688
Martin..

29:42.389 --> 29:44.565
Are you getting abused
at home?

29:44.652 --> 29:47.394
No. No way.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.091
My parents aren't around
enough to abuse me.

29:49.178 --> 29:51.267
So you're getting bullied
at school?

29:53.443 --> 29:55.532
Not really.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.927
I mean, kids can be morons,
but...it's not that bad.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.450
I went to high school.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.365
They eat kids
like you for breakfast.

30:02.452 --> 30:05.716
That's what Mr. McTierney
was helping you with, right?

30:08.502 --> 30:09.938
Whatever.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.462
He tried,
but what was he gonna do?

30:12.549 --> 30:14.682
'He couldn't be there
24/7.'

30:14.769 --> 30:17.946
And what kind of wuss needs a
teacher to protect him, anyways?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.687
It just made things worse.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.515
So you decided
to become a drug dealer.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.125
[scoffs]

30:23.212 --> 30:25.214
I just wanted to be popular.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.737
I thought if I became
the cool drug guy

30:26.825 --> 30:28.478
then everything
would be different.

30:28.565 --> 30:29.697
I wasn't even
gonna sell the E

30:29.784 --> 30:31.830
just give it away.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.657
I know that's crazy, but..

30:34.833 --> 30:38.053
I would do anything.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.750
You know what?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.622
I got my ass kicked
in high school.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.537
- Yeah, right.
- No, seriously.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.582
I was 5'4"
till my senior year.

30:45.669 --> 30:47.758
Then I grew a foot.
Things change.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.587
That would be so awesome.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.720
[phone vibrating]
Wait a second.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.028
Hey. What's up?

30:56.115 --> 30:58.552
Your.. Your what broke?

30:58.639 --> 31:01.642
Oh! Oh, oh! Uh, yeah, yeah.
Um, I'm on my way.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.078
'Uh, don't move!'

31:10.520 --> 31:11.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.045
- Everything okay?
- Her water broke.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.568
That's a good thing,
isn't it?

31:14.655 --> 31:16.570
Yeah. It's, uh...it's happening.
Can you tell Lisbon?

31:16.657 --> 31:18.224
- Yeah, I got you covered.
- Thank you.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.442
Good luck.

31:20.661 --> 31:21.836
[crickets chirping]

31:23.838 --> 31:26.797
[Grace sighs]
'We've watched 60 hours
worth of footage.'

31:26.885 --> 31:28.669
I think it's a dead end.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.671
Patience, grasshopper.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.152
I am being patient.

31:36.372 --> 31:37.852
There.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.549
Back that up.

31:39.636 --> 31:40.811
Okay.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.208
Can you.. Can you
grow that?

31:46.295 --> 31:48.732
Can you.. Can you
bigify it?

31:48.819 --> 31:50.343
I can do a digital zoom.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.562
[Patrick]
'Good.'

31:54.303 --> 31:57.002
- 'You know that kid?'
- 'Our Hamlet.'

31:58.264 --> 31:59.787
Well, that's interesting.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.747
That's well, that's
very interesting.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.838
What's interesting?

32:09.623 --> 32:10.798
I just talked to the DA.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.582
They're gonna go easy
on Martin

32:12.669 --> 32:14.062
but they don't want to pursue
Principal Snyder

32:14.149 --> 32:16.282
on the illegal cameras,
no upside.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.327
Well, that's a shame.
Let's get your jacket on.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.155
- We have to go.
- Where are we going?

32:20.242 --> 32:21.765
Back to school.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.246
[instrumental music]

32:26.161 --> 32:28.642
[indistinct chatter]

32:31.993 --> 32:34.604
Excellent. A full house.
Make sure you get a good seat.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.302
You're not coming with me?

32:36.389 --> 32:39.653
Well, I-I just have to make
a quick stop first.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.656
[sighs]

32:49.793 --> 32:50.969
[rattling]

32:56.061 --> 33:00.152
[Ms. Austin]
'Can I have my thespians
stage left, please?'

33:00.239 --> 33:02.589
'Time for our pre-show circle.
Looking good.'

33:02.676 --> 33:05.200
'Wonderful. Wonderful.'

33:05.287 --> 33:06.723
Five minutes.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.595
Oh. Hello, Mr. Jane.

33:08.682 --> 33:09.900
How's it going back here?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.728
Great. Oh, Sarah.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.253
Time to get
to the light board.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.124
'Lexi, please tuck in
that shirt.'

33:16.211 --> 33:18.039
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Jane.
I have to go.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.781
- It is absolute chaos.
- Of course. Of course.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.306
Jeremiah.
How are you feeling?

33:24.393 --> 33:26.482
You look a little green
around the gills.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.832
Uh.. I'm a little nervous.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.399
Well, that's to be expected.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.227
Why don't I give you
a little breathing exercise

33:32.314 --> 33:33.533
just to, to ground you?

33:33.620 --> 33:34.838
Yeah, sure, anything.

33:34.925 --> 33:38.103
Belly to the lips.
Mm, mm, mm.

33:38.190 --> 33:41.019
- Belly to the lips. Mm..
- Mm.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.455
[ululating]

33:42.542 --> 33:43.673
[both ululating]

33:44.805 --> 33:46.154
Okay. Short, quick breaths.

33:50.550 --> 33:51.812
Yeah. More.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.162
short and quick.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.469
Okay.. Faster.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.123
Now big, deep, long..

33:58.210 --> 34:00.734
Lots of oxygen.
Lots of oxygen.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.562
Oh.. Oh.

34:03.737 --> 34:05.695
There you go.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.784
Look how calm
you are now.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.352
Yes, yes.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.444
[indistinct chattering]

34:18.273 --> 34:20.928
um, there's someone
sitting there.

34:27.978 --> 34:29.110
Hi.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.851
Oh, my God!

34:30.938 --> 34:32.287
Should we call
an ambulance?

34:32.374 --> 34:34.811
No. No, no.
I think I'm okay.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.117
I-I don't know
what happened.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.032
You hyperventilated.
Silly boy.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.729
I think he'll be fine.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.470
I don't know that he'll be
able to perform tonight..

34:41.557 --> 34:43.646
But you do have
an understudy, don't you?

34:43.733 --> 34:46.823
We have oneunderstudy,
and he's already being used

34:46.910 --> 34:48.390
because Laertes has mono.

34:48.477 --> 34:51.480
- Oh.
- This is just a disaster.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.569
There's no way we can
go on without a ghost.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.528
Oh, we have to.
We've worked so hard.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.313
Can't we replace him?
Jeremiah wasn't even that good.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.315
Billy, don't say that.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.622
Who could we possibly get
to stand in for him?

35:02.709 --> 35:04.319
I don't know.
It's such an important role.

35:04.406 --> 35:06.016
- Stay down. Stay down.
- I know!

35:06.104 --> 35:07.627
Oh, you could do it,
Mr. Jane.

35:07.714 --> 35:08.715
You already know the lines,
don't you?

35:08.802 --> 35:10.847
Well, I-I-I couldn't possibly.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.849
Oh, please!
We're screwed if you don't.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.721
Yeah, come on, dude!

35:15.852 --> 35:17.158
What do you say,
Ms. Austin?

35:17.245 --> 35:20.248
I think, it's a brilliant idea.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.729
Good job, Rachel.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.513
Okay then. Well..

35:24.600 --> 35:26.211
The show must go on.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.735
Thank you. And you can
stay in what you're wearing.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.215
- It's perfect.
- Uh, uh..

35:30.302 --> 35:31.564
[female #1]
'Two minutes!'

35:31.651 --> 35:33.305
Overture and beginners!

35:34.958 --> 35:36.482
Stay down.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.619
[indistinct chattering]

35:47.841 --> 35:49.016
[mouthing]

35:58.156 --> 35:59.505
Have after. To what
issue will this come?

35:59.592 --> 36:01.811
Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.291
[male #3]
'Heaven will direct it.'

36:03.378 --> 36:05.902
[male #4]
'Nay, let's follow him.'

36:05.989 --> 36:08.078
Alright, Mr. Jane,
Billy, scene five.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.428
You are on.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.524
Wither wilt thou lead me?

36:18.611 --> 36:19.873
'Speak. I'll go no further.'

36:19.960 --> 36:21.483
- 'Mark me.'
- 'I will.'

36:21.570 --> 36:24.269
My hour is almost come

36:24.356 --> 36:27.620
when I to sulphurous
and tormenting flames

36:27.707 --> 36:29.535
'must render myself up.'

36:29.622 --> 36:32.538
- 'Alas, poor ghost.'
- 'Pity me not.'

36:32.625 --> 36:36.063
Lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.850
A tale of murder most foul.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.506
The murder of Mr. McTierney!

36:45.725 --> 36:47.161
[audience murmuring]

36:47.248 --> 36:49.032
Uh, uh, su-surely..

36:49.119 --> 36:51.818
th-thou means the murder
of my father, the king.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.124
A murder born of lust
in the woods

36:54.212 --> 36:56.910
next to the baseball field.

36:56.997 --> 37:00.696
N-nay! Thou means
the woods in Denmark! Right?

37:00.783 --> 37:04.396
A murder born of unnatural lust
between woman and boy.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.399
[audience murmuring]

37:08.226 --> 37:10.010
Um.. uh, line?

37:11.838 --> 37:14.362
A murder committed by you
with this baseball bat.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.452
N-no! I-it wasn't me!

37:17.539 --> 37:19.149
- No?
- It was her!

37:21.369 --> 37:23.589
Whoa, whoa!
Lisbon, we have a runner!

37:25.591 --> 37:27.723
Whoa!

37:27.810 --> 37:30.160
Hey.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.205
[grunting]

37:31.292 --> 37:32.424
Whoa.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.864
[chuckles]

37:37.951 --> 37:39.953
Well, thank you.
You've been a lovely audience.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.434
Sorry we had to close..
early

37:42.521 --> 37:45.437
but you get the general idea.
Pretty much everyone dies

37:45.524 --> 37:47.047
poisoning, stabbing.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.658
Yeah, it's all very sad.
The Scandinavians, huh?

37:49.745 --> 37:51.138
Gloomy bunch.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.183
Oh, and by the way, uh

37:53.271 --> 37:55.795
don't do anything naughty
in the bathrooms.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.624
Principal Snyder has
hidden cameras in there.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.452
'Illegal? Yes.'

38:00.539 --> 38:03.672
Immoral? You decide.

38:03.759 --> 38:04.891
[audience jeering]

38:04.978 --> 38:06.458
Goodnight.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.677
We found the bat
in your house.

38:08.764 --> 38:12.202
Ms. Austin is probably
blaming it all on you.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.857
So help yourself out.
Talk to me.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.124
She's 35. You're 16.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.431
That's statutory rape.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.608
So tell me what happened.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.827
[gasps]

38:30.090 --> 38:33.354
It started last semester
in her acting class.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.923
She was, like, passionate
about everything, you know?

38:37.010 --> 38:38.925
- Mm-hmm.
- It was exciting.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.710
And...she told me
I was talented.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.410
And asked me to audition
for the play.

38:47.803 --> 38:51.329
[Billy]
We started hooking up
after rehearsals.

38:54.157 --> 38:58.379
And then Mr. McTierney saw us when he was jogging that night.

39:02.209 --> 39:05.038
He said he was gonna
go to Principal Snyder.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.432
He said she was
gonna go to jail.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.480
She asked me to go
after him and stop him.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.136
She just wanted to talk
to him, she said

39:16.223 --> 39:18.312
to change his mind.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.488
I-I followed him
through the woods

39:20.575 --> 39:22.664
and out onto
the baseball field.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.231
I begged him not to tell.

39:24.318 --> 39:26.538
I didn't want her
to get in trouble.

39:29.715 --> 39:30.846
[grunting]

39:32.195 --> 39:34.589
[dramatic music]

39:38.941 --> 39:41.988
I know what I did
to Mr. McTierney

39:42.075 --> 39:43.816
is unforgivable

39:43.903 --> 39:48.037
and I wish to God
I could undo it

39:48.124 --> 39:50.257
but you have to understand.

39:50.344 --> 39:53.478
What Billy and I have
is special.

39:53.565 --> 39:54.827
It's real.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.786
I'm not some pervert.

39:58.918 --> 40:02.312
I love him,
and he loves me.

40:04.837 --> 40:07.709
Is that wrong?

40:07.796 --> 40:08.928
Yes.

40:11.539 --> 40:12.671
[sighs]

40:24.683 --> 40:27.468
Lindy, hi.
What are you doing here?

40:27.555 --> 40:29.296
I just wanted to say
thank you

40:29.383 --> 40:31.646
For figuring out what happened
to Mr. McTierney.

40:31.733 --> 40:34.432
Ohh...you're welcome.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.738
And also..

40:36.825 --> 40:39.959
I think I want to do
what he said.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.961
You know,
get out of the life.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.746
That's good, Lindy.
I'm happy for you.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.662
[chuckles]
I feel stupid.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.403
I don't know why
I'm telling you.

40:49.490 --> 40:53.102
It's just I don't really have
anyone else to say it to

40:53.189 --> 40:54.626
now that he's gone.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.847
Well, I know
a social worker.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.370
I'll get you her number.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.460
There's all sorts of programs
and shelters.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.418
She can help you.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.987
Thank you.

41:08.074 --> 41:09.858
[sighs]
Sure.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.994
Hey, how did you know
Billy was having an affair

41:15.081 --> 41:16.952
with the teacher?

41:17.039 --> 41:18.650
They both had leaves
on them

41:18.737 --> 41:21.174
from their make-out spot
in the woods.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.610
That's it?

41:22.697 --> 41:24.090
Well, plus I could see
she liked him.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.440
She was meaner to him
than the other kids.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.355
You know, like Lisbon
is to me.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.748
Shut up!

41:29.835 --> 41:31.358
See?

41:31.445 --> 41:32.925
[phone beeps]

41:33.012 --> 41:34.796
Oh, a text from Rigsby.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.537
[phone vibrating]

41:36.624 --> 41:37.756
[phones beeping]

41:39.279 --> 41:40.759
It's a boy. Benjamin.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.065
He's so cute.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.591
Yeah, if Winston Churchill
was cute.

41:46.678 --> 41:48.070
More like Mao Tse-tung.

41:48.157 --> 41:49.376
Yeah. You're right.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.899
Hush. He's gorgeous.

41:52.031 --> 41:54.555
Yeah. He is gorgeous.

41:56.122 --> 41:58.994
[instrumental music]

42:12.399 --> 42:15.010
[theme music]
