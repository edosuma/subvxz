01:57.041 --> 01:59.000

was your best friend.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.750
When Monique is mine,

02:22.750 --> 02:24.250
I might let you wash her.

I don't think so.
You scratched it.

Hmm. Now, who would I believe?

You're not going to blame
this one on me.

Yes, I am.
No, you're not.

What did I say about standing
so close to Monique?

Oh, Father, thank goodness
you're back.

I can't understand
what you're saying, boy.

I think he said
he needs to go
to the hospital.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.000
Right, Brad.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.208
No! No, I didn't--

03:37.208 --> 03:38.750
Good idea, Brad.
We'll take my car.

Yeah.

it's getting worse.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.208
Don't worry, Dad.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.375
I'll look after Monique

happen to her.
[whimpers]

04:00.208 --> 04:02.583

04:02.583 --> 04:04.250

For Brad.

04:04.250 --> 04:07.959
Right.
You're dead meat.

Who's Monique?

04:12.500 --> 04:15.000
Gunther, don't move.
I didn't break
anything.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.875
I know you didn't.
Brad did.

04:16.875 --> 04:19.166
And if I don't get it fixed
before Dad gets home,

04:19.166 --> 04:20.208
I'm going to be grounded

04:20.208 --> 04:21.500
till I'm old enough
to drive.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.667
Have you tried using
your time machine?

04:23.667 --> 04:25.000
I don't have a time machine,
Gunther,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.667
Or you could just tell
your dad the truth.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.750
I don't know what I'd do
if anything were to--

04:31.750 --> 04:34.166

...happen to her.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.583

04:35.583 --> 04:37.625
I think I'll fix it myself.

what could go wrong?

04:47.834 --> 04:50.291
There, good as new.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.208
Ew.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.500
You're right, Gunther.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.750
I can't go through this

05:14.792 --> 05:15.291
Okay, here's the plan.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.291

to stall Dad and Brad

05:17.291 --> 05:18.542
while Wade and I fix Dad's car.

05:18.542 --> 05:19.792

05:19.792 --> 05:21.041
Monique.

05:21.041 --> 05:22.333
So let me get this straight.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.500
You're asking us to help you
cover up the truth?

05:24.500 --> 05:25.625
Not just cover it up.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.834
We need to bury the old truth

the shovel.

were you?

05:39.750 --> 05:42.792

I'll just stall them
at the hospital.

Is it serious,
Dr. Guntherstein?

06:07.083 --> 06:10.458
Could be,
but he may have
to stay overnight.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.917
His motto--

12:06.917 --> 12:09.041
Do it all...
and then some.

12:09.041 --> 12:12.500
But our story begins
when he was still
Alive Man Dave.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.625
Dave built the very first
custom skateboard

12:16.625 --> 12:19.375
and used it for every one
of his death-defying stunts.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.041
That board
is rumored to be imbued

12:21.041 --> 12:23.208
with his legendary
skateboarding prowess

12:23.208 --> 12:26.000
and he wanted only his most
worthy successor to have it.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.834
So your oral report
is about some dead
guy's magic skateboard?

12:29.834 --> 12:32.083
Dead Man Dave
didn't need magic.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.041
He had skills,

12:33.041 --> 12:35.208
and only
an equally skilled daredevil

12:35.208 --> 12:37.083
could inherit
his most treasured board,

12:37.083 --> 12:38.458
which is why he hid it

12:38.458 --> 12:39.458
deep in a booby-trapped cave

12:39.458 --> 12:42.208
that was lost to the ages...

12:42.208 --> 12:44.250
until I found it yesterday.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.583
[students gasp]

12:45.583 --> 12:48.041
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

12:48.041 --> 12:50.667
You really think
Dead Man Dave's board
is down there?

12:50.667 --> 12:52.875
Check it.
His autobiography.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.458
If you're reading this,

12:54.458 --> 12:58.041
you're not extreme enough

12:55.917 --> 12:58.041
to inherit my legacy.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.750
Three-hundred blank pages?

12:59.750 --> 13:01.417
Quite a bold publishing choice.

13:01.417 --> 13:03.500
Of course it is, Gunther.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.625
I still don't get it.

13:15.625 --> 13:19.125
Dave wanted someone worthy
to inherit his legacy
of danger,

13:19.125 --> 13:21.125
and that someone is...

13:21.125 --> 13:23.208
Kick Buttowski.

13:23.208 --> 13:26.083
And Gunther.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.583
Solid wall.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.250
Oh, well, let's go home.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.333
I know it's here somewhere.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.166
But we're at a dead end.
It's a wall.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.125
I don't believe in dead ends.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.625
Or walls.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.542
And neither did Dead Man Dave.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.166
[Gunther]
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

13:50.166 --> 13:53.583
Trust me.
This is one of Dave's tests.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.000
There's got to be a better way.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.375
And there it is.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.083
[grunting]

14:02.583 --> 14:05.709
Kick, I'm not
as athletic as I look.

14:05.709 --> 14:07.083
We'll find another way.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.375
Hey hey, watch out
for those mushrooms.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.125
[screams]
Mushrooms!

14:11.125 --> 14:16.709
Your fear of fungus
has served us well.

14:16.709 --> 14:17.792
Finally.

14:19.583 --> 14:23.083
Careful, Gunther.
This place is probably filled
with booby traps.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.834
[laughs]
You said boo--

14:25.834 --> 14:27.166
[rumbling]

14:28.375 --> 14:30.166
[both gasp]
Run!

14:33.417 --> 14:35.083
[Gunther]
Hey, a tunnel.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.500
[Kick]
Two tunnels.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.333
Let's go down
the nice tunnel.

14:39.333 --> 14:43.500
No. This is how
Dead Man Dave separates
the men from the boys.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.792
But I am a boy.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.125
Biscuits.
A bottomless pit.

14:51.125 --> 14:53.375
I told you we should have gone
into the nice one.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.333
I bet there was popcorn
and drinks in there.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.208
There's only one way
out of this.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.500
Oh, no.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.542
Oh, yes.

14:59.542 --> 15:00.875
Come on, Gunther.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.166
Do it all...
and then some.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.709
[Teacher]
Uh, just one second here.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.000
So let me get this straight.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.625
You broke through
a granite wall,

15:07.625 --> 15:09.792
survived a chamber
of killer stalagmites,

15:09.792 --> 15:11.500
then dove feet first
into a bottomless pit?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.750
Well, how else
was I going to get the board?

15:13.750 --> 15:15.250
Proceed.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.166
[screaming]

15:18.166 --> 15:20.792
Relax, Gunther.
It's like skydiving.

15:20.792 --> 15:23.917
Except we don't have
parachutes!

15:23.917 --> 15:26.542
Good point.
Whoo-hoo!

15:29.583 --> 15:31.250
[Kick] Yeah!
[Gunther screaming]

15:44.333 --> 15:46.542
Hey, is sewage
the same thing as poop?

15:46.542 --> 15:47.917
No.

15:48.834 --> 15:49.875
Are you sure?

15:49.875 --> 15:51.458
It tasted like poop.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.250
How would you know?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.500
Never mind.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.917
Chimichanga!
[screams]

16:01.917 --> 16:03.500
[chomping]

16:03.500 --> 16:05.834
Objection!
Mrs. Fitzpatrick,

16:05.834 --> 16:09.375
this circus is a waste
of educational resources.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.000
This report makes no sense.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.625
Quiet, Kendall!

16:13.625 --> 16:15.917
And then what happened?

16:15.917 --> 16:17.959
After we escaped the crocodiles

16:17.959 --> 16:19.875
and battled a race
of subhuman cave dwellers,

16:19.875 --> 16:23.333
we found ourselves
right outside...

16:23.333 --> 16:25.250
Dead Man Dave's hideout.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.375
[grunting]

16:28.375 --> 16:31.291
It's locked.
Rats.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.667
Don't worry.
Dead Man Dave hid
a key somewhere in here.

16:34.667 --> 16:35.875
No, rats!

16:38.792 --> 16:40.458
That's more like it, Dave.

16:43.041 --> 16:43.917
[screams]

16:46.125 --> 16:47.709
[animal roars]

16:51.041 --> 16:51.875
[growls]

16:51.875 --> 16:54.041
[roars]

16:56.625 --> 16:57.917
[Kick grunting]

16:59.917 --> 17:03.125
[Kendall]
Will someone please
stop this insanity?

17:03.125 --> 17:05.875
A giant queen rat, you say?

17:05.875 --> 17:09.709
What you're describing
is biologically inconceivable.

17:09.709 --> 17:11.208
Axle grease from Dave's boards

17:11.208 --> 17:13.458
causes extreme growth
in rats.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.041
It's called science, Kendall.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.875
I believe you, Kick.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.500
[murmuring]

17:20.500 --> 17:22.625
Order! Order!

17:22.625 --> 17:24.041
Quiet down.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.917
Oh, I refuse to keep quiet.

17:25.917 --> 17:28.125
Ugh, not this again.

17:28.125 --> 17:31.750
He's innocent.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.750
He's innocent!

17:31.750 --> 17:33.041
[muffled]
He's innocent!

17:33.041 --> 17:34.250
[no audible dialogue]

17:34.250 --> 17:37.792
Proceed, Mr. Buttowski.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.542
Like I was saying,

17:39.542 --> 17:42.875
I had just been thrown
into a wall by a giant
queen rat.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.875
[roars]

17:52.375 --> 17:53.917
Kick, what are you doing?

17:53.917 --> 17:55.625
I am getting that key.

17:55.625 --> 17:56.667
[rat growls]

18:06.542 --> 18:07.542
[roars]

18:09.083 --> 18:10.709
[roars]

18:10.709 --> 18:12.208
Kick?

18:12.208 --> 18:14.083
[gulps]

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
[growls]
Kick?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.000
Kick!

18:19.000 --> 18:20.667
[roars]

18:21.875 --> 18:23.333
[shudders]
Look.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.041
Wouldn't you rather eat
a sandwich?

18:26.041 --> 18:27.250
Mmm.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.000
Yummy peanut butter.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.417
Oops.

18:33.417 --> 18:34.917
[blows landing]
[shrieks]

18:38.667 --> 18:40.583
Kick? Are you in there?

18:40.583 --> 18:42.875
Come on, Gunther.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.125
How did you get out of there?

18:44.125 --> 18:45.333
You don't want to know.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.291
You're totally hardcore.

18:50.542 --> 18:53.000
[Kick]
Dead Man Dave's secret hideout.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.041
Look at all these boards.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.500
And all these salty snacks.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.917
Careful, Gunther.
Don't touch anything.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.709
Kick, you got it!

19:10.709 --> 19:12.959
Dead Man Dave's
legendary skateboard!

19:12.959 --> 19:14.250
Not quite yet.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.250
[crashes]

19:18.125 --> 19:20.917
This is the one.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.542
Found some chips.
Gunther, no!

19:25.041 --> 19:26.959
But I wasn't touching.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.083
Gunther, come on.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.667
Huh?

19:39.500 --> 19:41.125
[screams]

19:41.125 --> 19:43.625
Kick, I can't hold on.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.333
So, Kick,
we almost made it.

19:51.333 --> 19:54.250
No, Gunther,
we almost didn't make it.

19:54.250 --> 19:55.875
Here's how it's gonna go down.

19:55.875 --> 19:58.083
I let go of this ledge
and swing us both into the air.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.834
I quadruple somersault
onto that volcano

19:59.834 --> 20:00.959
next to Dave's skateboard,

20:00.959 --> 20:02.875
flipping you backward
onto the ledge.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.500
I grab the board,
you hoist us up,

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
and we're on our way.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.917
It's no use, Kick.
Leave me behind.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.125
Save the board.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.083
I'm replaceable.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.291
No, man.
I'm gonna get you both.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.125
You can't do it all.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.083
I have to do it all...

20:20.083 --> 20:21.291
and then some.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.291
On three.

20:22.291 --> 20:23.291
One...

20:23.291 --> 20:24.250
two--

20:24.250 --> 20:26.125
<i>Wait, wait, wait,</i>
<i>wait, wait.</i>

20:26.125 --> 20:29.333
You mean to tell me,
out of a room full
of golden skateboards,

20:29.333 --> 20:31.041
you chose the nasty old
wooden wooden

20:31.041 --> 20:34.250
held together by nails
and duct tape?
That's tight.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.750
And where's your proof,
Mr. Buttowski?

20:36.750 --> 20:40.041
Gunther's right
over there, isn't he?

20:40.041 --> 20:42.333
Well, then, where is
this super skateboard
of yours?

20:42.333 --> 20:44.000
[all] Eww!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.041
It's an oral report,
Kendall.

20:46.041 --> 20:47.000
Not show-and-tell.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.291
[class] Eww!

20:48.291 --> 20:52.083
Well, your entire report
was obviously fabricated.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.875
But I must admit,

20:53.875 --> 20:54.792
you entertained us all.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.750
You pass... barely.

20:56.750 --> 20:57.667
I can live with that.

21:04.709 --> 21:06.583
Um, Mr. Buttowski,

21:06.583 --> 21:07.709
school's not out yet.

21:07.709 --> 21:09.667
It's only 11:30.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.667
This means detention!

21:11.667 --> 21:14.083
Mr. Buttowski!

21:23.250 --> 21:24.625
Tell me, Kick.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.667
How did you escape
that giant queen rat?

21:26.667 --> 21:28.583
Well, that's easy, Gunther.

21:28.583 --> 21:31.000
I just ran around in circles
until I was all pooped out.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.917
