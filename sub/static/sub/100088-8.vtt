didn't need the surgery,

was right, though.

the operation,

09:05.022 --> 09:07.503

would still be alive.

to get lectured.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.986

for the rest of my life.

with Lindell?

by the ops center,

Only if you're taking an Uber.Hey.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.521
We find more peace
on the battlefield

10:52.564 --> 10:55.219

10:55.263 --> 10:57.526
You know? You realize,

10:57.569 --> 11:00.485

there's a fairness in war.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.314
Kill or be killed. That's it.

11:03.358 --> 11:07.623
And I take great comfort
in that simplicity.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.973
Is there a point to all this?

11:10.017 --> 11:11.540
The threat that you can't shoot,

11:11.583 --> 11:13.585
that's what messes you up
the most.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.197
You know, what you're going
through right now, Jace,

11:16.240 --> 11:17.589

11:17.633 --> 11:19.330

You can't snipe it.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.723

a grenade at it.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.899

a damn RPG at it.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.423

no different now.

Last night, Marine Corps
Captain Brie Campbell

12:28.748 --> 12:29.923
was shot down over
the Iran/Iraq border.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.533
F-35 wreckage was found

12:31.576 --> 12:34.884
on the Iraqi side of the
border by U.S. forces.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.886
Because the pilot ejected
and there was no trace

12:36.930 --> 12:39.889
of her beacon, Captain Campbell
was presumed dead.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.065
Three hours ago,
she called in.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.763
What happened to her beacon?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.242
Apparently,
it was damaged.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.549
After she ejected, Campbell
landed across the border

12:47.592 --> 12:49.769
from the plane,
on the Iranian side.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.466
She's evaded capture
for nearly 27 hours.

12:51.509 --> 12:52.728
[Sonny whistles]

I'll bet the captain
aced her SERE training.

You'll have
the opportunity

12:56.297 --> 12:58.038
to congratulate her in person.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.910
Bravo is being sent
to bring Campbell home.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.912
LINDELL:
Everyone here is aware
of the storm we'll be facing

13:02.956 --> 13:06.002
if word gets out that Bravo
is operating in Iran.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.830
This operation
is highly classified.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.441
The only people being read in
are the people in this room.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.747

13:23.367 --> 13:24.934

for a Marine battalion.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.588
The rescue will be
extremely difficult

13:26.631 --> 13:28.111

in the area.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.939
I'm getting intel together now.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.028
We should have an updated
battle map in a few hours.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.464

the surgery.

come here to give me

13:53.006 --> 13:55.486
that "attaboy" speech, huh?I heard Bravo

13:55.530 --> 13:57.880
was spun up.
I figured maybe you could use

13:57.924 --> 13:59.621
a ride to the hospital and back.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.928
There's a-a reason
why they invented Uber.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.495
For people like me
to use them, all right?

14:04.539 --> 14:07.585
Uh-huh. You are feisty
this morning, I see.

release you to a cab or an Uber

14:22.862 --> 14:24.167

14:25.734 --> 14:27.562
Campbell's last known location
was here,

14:27.605 --> 14:29.956
approximately 35 kilometers
southeast of Pol-e Zahab.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.175
Any reasonable expectation
she's still there?

14:32.219 --> 14:33.916
Unfortunately, no.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.091
Campbell's trying to prevent
the enemy

14:35.135 --> 14:36.832
from triangulating
her location,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.965
so she's only calling in
every three hours.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.010
During the hours
that she's out of communication,

14:41.054 --> 14:43.186
we have no way
to track her movements.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.841
All right, so let's assume
that she's still at least close

14:45.885 --> 14:48.148

That way,
they'll avoid the fighting.Given the distance

speak to the Marines,

to fighting south?

36:52.775 --> 36:54.560
I haven't held up my end.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.170
I should have handled
my business.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.824
So we work it out.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.652
Together.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.394
Bravo's not your only team,
baby.

37:02.437 --> 37:03.917
You're definitely
the better-looking one,

37:03.960 --> 37:06.398
I'll tell you that much.Well, that's not saying much.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.008
[both chuckle]

37:09.227 --> 37:11.403
NATALIE:
Why didn't you call me?

37:15.972 --> 37:18.366
All the skills the Navy
teaches its operators,

37:18.410 --> 37:20.803
they leave out
the most important one.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.286
What's that?

37:25.330 --> 37:27.636
How to ask for help.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.899
[door opens]

37:40.823 --> 37:42.782
Uh, I've been meaning to say

37:42.825 --> 37:44.827
I like your shoes.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.483
Thanks.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.616
Just, uh... just got 'em.

37:50.659 --> 37:53.009
Well, you have
excellent taste.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.667
Uh, I assume
that you can't tell me

37:58.711 --> 38:00.713
where you've been
or what you've been doing,

38:00.756 --> 38:04.369
but could you at least tell me
what's been bothering you?

38:05.979 --> 38:09.678
They want to give me a medal
for what happened in Yemen.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.767
And you don't want it.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.771
Uh, it just doesn't
really feel right.

38:15.815 --> 38:18.470
Well, you can tell them
where to put it.

38:18.513 --> 38:19.775
[chuckles]

38:19.819 --> 38:21.603
It's the military.

38:21.647 --> 38:24.084
They want to give you a medal,
they give you a medal.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.999
What, you can't just
give it back?

38:26.042 --> 38:27.522
No.
[laughs]

38:27.566 --> 38:29.350
It doesn't really
work like that.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.787
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

38:31.831 --> 38:33.876
I can tell you what
the ambassador would have done

38:33.920 --> 38:35.704
if someone forced
an award on her.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.360
She would have used it.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.754
Nicole always talked about
wanting to have

38:41.797 --> 38:46.367
the biggest impact
on the world she could.

38:46.411 --> 38:50.763
And she used everything she had
in her arsenal to do that.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.071
Sounds like her.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.990
SONNY: Mother of Mary,
I got neighbors, man.[dogs barking]

39:01.034 --> 39:03.123
What the hell?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.127
Davis, what the hell
are you doing here?

39:07.170 --> 39:08.694
You almost got yourself killed.

39:08.737 --> 39:10.391
Well, not exactly.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.610
Yes, exactly.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.394
That is exactly what happened.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.483
[pounding on nearby door]I told you.
I got some neighbors.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.919
I do not care
about your neighbors.

39:16.963 --> 39:19.052
I care that you almost died.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.750
I'm okay.

39:21.794 --> 39:24.231
I'm fine.
I can't believe that
you would scare me like that.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.929
You are such a jackass, Sonny.

39:26.973 --> 39:29.149
Well, this jackass is okay.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.499
Really?
Mm.

39:31.543 --> 39:34.807
See, I knew you were
gonna be upset.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.722
What the hell, Sonny?

39:36.765 --> 39:39.681
You're right, I am.
Mm-hmm.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.509
Don't do it again.

39:42.771 --> 39:44.512
Cross my heart.

39:45.905 --> 39:49.169
You know, just
because we ended...

39:49.212 --> 39:50.953
doesn't mean
I stopped loving you.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.915
Yeah.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.960
That's the bitch,
ain't it?

40:02.791 --> 40:04.967
THERAPIST:
Have you tried
therapy before?

40:06.491 --> 40:08.928
Uh, against my will. Yeah.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.582
Then why are you here?

40:10.625 --> 40:12.235
[chuckles]

40:14.107 --> 40:16.762
Just, uh...
[clears throat]

40:16.805 --> 40:22.332
All the good things
from my past are just gone,

40:22.376 --> 40:25.727
and, uh, the future
just looks empty

40:25.771 --> 40:28.164
to me.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.862
It's like I'm...

40:32.038 --> 40:35.737
...so dead inside.

40:35.781 --> 40:38.784
I look to the future,
and I don't see anything.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.830
It all just looks
so empty to me.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.835
I just feel like
the past is haunting me,

40:46.879 --> 40:49.969
and, uh...

40:50.012 --> 40:52.275
I don't know how to stop it.

40:53.407 --> 40:55.496
I don't know how to stop it.

40:55.540 --> 40:59.065
So I thought, I don't know...

41:02.938 --> 41:04.940
I need help.

41:07.856 --> 41:10.424
Can you help me?

41:10.468 --> 41:13.732
[shuddering breaths]
