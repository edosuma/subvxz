WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.138
Hands off, old man!
This is my lasagna!

00:04.172 --> 00:05.173
I don't care
if it's the last one.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.840
My fingers
touched it first.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.842
You want to review
the security footage?

00:08.876 --> 00:11.979
Yo, isn't that
Graham's mom?
Man: Let go!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.481
Yeah.
It's Graham's mom.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.315
Angie?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.584
-Fine!

00:16.617 --> 00:17.418
Hey.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.719
-Hi!
-Hey.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.154
What are you guys
doing here?

00:20.188 --> 00:21.922
-Oh, we're just --
-Oh, I-I came here by mistake.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.091
This isn't my cart.
I asked you a question.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.426
What are you doing here?
-Uh, we're just, um,

00:25.459 --> 00:27.027
doing some
Palentine shopping.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.930
Yeah, Will has a, uh,
magical night planned for me.

00:29.963 --> 00:33.167
"You make the flowers bloom.
You make the stars shine.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.035
Will you be my Palentine?"

00:35.969 --> 00:37.205
I have a pal!

00:37.238 --> 00:39.107
Will, I'm so sorry
that I didn't respond before.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.374
I have plans with Owen.

00:40.408 --> 00:43.043
By the way, the flowers you sent
had aphids in them.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.845
It took me, like, a week
to get them out of my kitchen.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.714
You got invited, too?

00:46.747 --> 00:47.581
Yeah.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.949
So, Angie,

00:48.982 --> 00:50.751
cooking a romantic meal
for Owen, huh?

00:50.784 --> 00:52.753
I see you're making him
frozen turkey,

00:52.786 --> 00:55.723
light bulbs,
pre-sliced radishes, and...

00:57.158 --> 00:59.393
...12 boxes of condoms.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.928
Did I say
we had plans later

01:00.961 --> 01:04.365
or did I say
we had plans later?!

01:06.800 --> 01:08.636
Okay, fine.
You got me, okay?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.138
I'm working.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.939
For Beck+Call.
The delivery app.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.707
Did you get fired
from your law firm?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.809
Let me guess --
Drugs? Drinking?

01:15.843 --> 01:16.910
Aged out?

01:16.944 --> 01:19.247
All flattering guesses,
but no.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.949
Just a side job --
make some extra cash.

01:21.982 --> 01:22.983
Right.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.752
Hey, are --
are you in a pinch?

01:24.785 --> 01:26.086
I'd love to help out
any way I can.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.988
No, dude.
Dude, I'm fine. I'm --

01:28.021 --> 01:29.723
I'm actually
kind of good at this.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.293
-I think Britney45,

01:32.326 --> 01:33.627
that's my screen name,

01:33.661 --> 01:35.463
is gonna get
the "Golden Cart" tonight.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.166
It's a money bonus
that Beck+Call gives you

01:38.199 --> 01:40.234
when you get 10 good reviews
in a row.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.570
I'm gonna use it to pay
for Graham's trip to El Capitan.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.972
Especially since Jackie is
all over me for the money.

01:45.005 --> 01:49.076
So, checks can be made out
to "Jackie Has a Business, LLC."

01:49.109 --> 01:51.145
Still waiting
on a few deposits.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.082
-Hi, Jackie.
-Hi, Angie.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.785
Well, it -- it is
Palentine's Day,

01:57.818 --> 02:00.120
so I don't know
if you'd want a couple of pals

02:00.154 --> 02:01.455
to assist you
in any way.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.524
Really?
You'd do that?

02:03.557 --> 02:04.625
We got your back,
Angie.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.793
-Oh, wow.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.128
Okay. Uh, thanks.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.630
So, fill this cart
with ground beef,

02:09.663 --> 02:11.299
and I'll meet you
at the birthday cakes.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.303
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:17.671 --> 02:21.141
So, who's coming with me
to the sauna?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.211
MacArthur's farewell address...

02:23.244 --> 02:25.346
Reagan's Evil Empire speech...

02:25.379 --> 02:29.383
Jack Palance accepting
his Oscar for "City Slickers"...

02:36.890 --> 02:38.859
I was watching
"Newhart" reruns.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.561
It got me feeling
all frisky.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.695
Big Red.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.132
I-Is this some type
of Valentine's surprise?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.468
Pbbt! Valentine's
is for dopes.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.137
It's just a cash-grab cooked up
by the crepe paper industry.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.306
Yes.
Now, let's make
some sugar.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.407
I-I-I -- B-Bu--

02:53.441 --> 02:56.344
L-Listen, unfortunately,
I'm occupied.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.011
Oh. Where is she?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.013
I'm sure the three of us
can work something out.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.483
Uh, n-no,
it's not another woman.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.151
I'm babysitting.
Gotcha.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.820
I guess I can call the guy
that sold me my snowmobile.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.021
-Toodles!
-No, no, hey!

03:08.055 --> 03:09.757
You know what?
I'll just put them to bed!

03:09.790 --> 03:11.325
-How long we talking?
-Not long.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.896
6:08, lights out.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.931
What about dinner?
Ah, you can have it
for breakfast.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.032
What's with D'Amato?

03:19.066 --> 03:21.502
Louisa gave him
a personal Valentine.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.371
Poured her heart out in a way
that I can only describe

03:23.404 --> 03:24.738
as "raw."

03:24.772 --> 03:26.274
And Graham gave her...

03:26.307 --> 03:29.743
A picture of a mouse
that said "Cheese be mine!"

03:29.777 --> 03:31.379
It's so first thought.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.381
Graham: Oh, Louisa.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.383
I wanted to write her
something personal...

03:35.416 --> 03:38.886
...but alas, I was a coward.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.555
Sounds like
a tomorrow problem.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.023
Okay,
everybody go to sleep

03:43.056 --> 03:44.958
or just lie there
with your eyes closed.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.860
I don't care.
-I'll get to sleep...

03:46.894 --> 03:49.096
as soon as I craft
the perfect Valentine.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.798
Until then,
I will not rest,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.900
I cannot rest,
and I shall not rest!

03:52.933 --> 03:54.535
-This ain't going away.
-Emma, Amy,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.570
there's a visitor out there
in a trench coat.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.105
Keep her occupied.
-Sir, yes, sir!

03:58.138 --> 03:59.573
Just like
we trained for!

03:59.607 --> 04:01.542
Great. Quickly.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.444
Okay, what do you need
from me?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.479
Your wisdom,
your honesty,

04:05.513 --> 04:07.648
and most of all,
your heart.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.083
It's interesting that my kids
are friends with you.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.926
I feel like dipping something
in tartar sauce.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.960
Right away.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.429
We'll microwave
some clam strips.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.099
Come on. Mark's almost here.
Time to go.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.135
Oh.
I'm not going anywhere.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.471
I can't watch you suffer
through another failed romance

04:30.504 --> 04:31.572
with a mediocre man.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.106
That nonsense
ends tonight.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.782
Rory. Rory!

04:43.651 --> 04:44.852
Uh, I'm Mark.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.821
Uh, I'm your mom's,
Poppy's, um...

04:47.855 --> 04:48.822
driver.

04:48.856 --> 04:52.760
I'm here to take her...
to a, uh...

04:52.793 --> 04:55.963
floral design competition,
of which this is my first entry.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.099
Oh, Mark, you think
I don't know about you?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.133
I know.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.869
I'm not sure
how information is shared

05:01.902 --> 05:03.637
between you
and your 30 kids,

05:03.671 --> 05:06.106
but my mom and I
are very open,

05:06.139 --> 05:08.542
so please,
have a seat.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.510
Okay.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.212
-Hm.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.182
Um, Rory, you and I talked
about me dating,

05:15.215 --> 05:16.784
and you said
you were okay.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.986
I am. I just don't know
if you two are compatible.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.154
So, uh,
land your can, Poppy.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.155
It's game time.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.657
What do you mean
"game time"?

05:24.758 --> 05:27.961
Welcome to...

05:27.995 --> 05:29.463
"Scenarios!"

05:35.836 --> 05:37.738
All right.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.040
Nine deliveries down,
one to go.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.308
Thank you, guys.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.511
Now I can see Owen
for Valentine's Day.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.646
Oh.
Yeah, and now I can see Will
for Palentine's Day.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.648
And also every other person
Will knows

05:47.681 --> 05:49.517
who didn't have
something better to do.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.252
Okay.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.829
That is good.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.930
Oh, that's funny.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.097
Yeah, just give me
one second.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.566
Angie?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.368
What are you doing here?

06:10.270 --> 06:12.105
Hello!

06:12.139 --> 06:14.007
I'm...here
for the party.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.609
You don't remember me
RSVPing?

06:15.643 --> 06:17.745
I don't remember
inviting you.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.046
But I guess...

06:19.079 --> 06:20.380
come in?

06:20.414 --> 06:21.682
Huh.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.284
A couples Valentine's party
with the parents from school?

06:24.317 --> 06:25.953
I'm in.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.459
Make yourself at home.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.793
You're the only
unmarried person here.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.394
I hope
that doesn't bother you.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.629
Oh, no, no.

06:35.663 --> 06:39.099
It just...frees me up
to flirt with all your husbands.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.203
Jared, honey, stay close.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.939
Where are the groceries?

06:45.973 --> 06:48.742
Oh, hon, I told you
to stop using Beck+Call.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.277
They hire
gutter people.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.946
I mean, there's a reason
why they're
delivering groceries.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.615
Right?
It's just like...

06:54.648 --> 06:56.917
why can't you just be rich?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.452
So true.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.287
I'm writing
a scathing review.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.723
I'm gonna bury Britney45.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.825
Will you excuse me?
I gotta --

07:04.858 --> 07:06.460
-Spell "delinquent."
-"Delinquent" --

07:06.494 --> 07:07.961
D-E-L-I-N...
-Mm-hmm.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.332
Angie, what's taking you
so long?

07:12.365 --> 07:14.635
Are you under duress?
If so, order a pizza.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.136
I'm not ordering a pizza, okay?

07:16.169 --> 07:17.471
This is Jackie's house!

07:17.505 --> 07:19.439
I told her that I came
to her stupid party

07:19.473 --> 07:21.509
'cause I didn't want her to know
that I work for Beck+Call.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.579
She gave me a bad review.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.914
Zero stars?!

07:26.947 --> 07:28.849
The bitch torched me!

07:28.882 --> 07:31.652
Just because I threw
her groceries in the bushes.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.120
You what?
You don't get it.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.088
I need
that Golden Cart money!

07:35.122 --> 07:36.790
Graham's trip
depends on it.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.126
-Aw, Ang...
-Don't "Aw, Ang" me!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.628
Just get in here
and help me steal her phone

07:40.661 --> 07:42.462
so I can
rewrite the review.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.299
I gotta go bail Angie out
of another jam.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.836
So, what, you just want me
to wait in the car, like a dog?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.170
This is supposed
to be our night.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.171
It is.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.140
Y-You know, I guess
on Palentine's Day,

07:53.173 --> 07:56.143
it's natural to ask
the question, Will...

07:56.176 --> 07:57.144
what are we?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.478
Fine.
You want to come? Come.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.614
Do you really want me to come,
or are you just saying that?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.650
I really
want you to come.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.685
Fine. But we can't go
empty-handed.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.522
Oh! I invited
you guys, too?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.023
Can't drink and Evite
anymore.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.860
Oh, my God,
is that crudités?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.562
I ordered some
that never came.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.530
Let's party!
Mwah!

08:18.098 --> 08:20.000
Should I be concerned?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.468
I-I knew
I should've worn a suit.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
I-I second-guessed myself
at the door.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.838
No, no, it's just
Rory being Rory.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.708
He can be overprotective
and a little dramatic.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.511
Your "Scenarios!"
categories --

08:31.545 --> 08:33.480
"It's All Relatives,"

08:33.513 --> 08:34.514
"Robes & Baths,"

08:34.548 --> 08:35.649
"Three-Day Weekends,"

08:35.683 --> 08:36.750
"Out On The Town,"

08:36.784 --> 08:38.819
and "State Capitals."

08:38.852 --> 08:40.487
Contestant 2?
-Hmm...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.722
let's do
"Robes & Baths."

08:43.857 --> 08:47.360
"My mom draws you a bath.
Do you take the bath?"

08:47.394 --> 08:48.896
Bath...bath...

08:48.929 --> 08:50.097
Do I take the bath?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.164
No, I don't think I do.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.232
Yes.
Correct.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.001
In this scenario,
my mom drew you a bath

08:54.034 --> 08:55.335
as a test because...

08:55.368 --> 08:56.704
Rory and Poppy:
"Men who take baths are weird."

08:56.737 --> 08:58.438
-Mm.
-Okay, um,

08:58.471 --> 08:59.539
I'll take
"State Capitals."

09:00.473 --> 09:03.076
"What is the state capital
of Oregon?"

09:03.110 --> 09:04.745
Okay, how is that
a scenario?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.413
Fine.
Salem. Right?
Yeah.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.348
See? We'll be done
in no time.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.783
I'll try "State Capitals."

09:09.817 --> 09:11.418
Multiple choice!

09:11.451 --> 09:13.854
"You and my mom are in
Topeka, Kansas, for a wedding.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.555
You've just learned
that the theme is 'The Beach,'

09:15.589 --> 09:17.457
and neither of you
have packed the proper clothes.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.260
Do you 'A' -- pretend that
you never got the invitation,

09:20.293 --> 09:21.729
'B' -- buy beach clothes,

09:21.762 --> 09:23.263
'C' -- purposefully
drive your rental car

09:23.296 --> 09:24.397
off the road?"

09:24.431 --> 09:26.199
-I'll go with --
-Hold your horses, cowboy.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.300
The answers go to "N."

09:27.334 --> 09:29.737
"'D' -- get into a fight."

09:31.504 --> 09:33.406
So, here's the plan -- Jackie
has been on her phone all night,

09:33.440 --> 09:34.908
and she keeps
Instagramming the party

09:34.942 --> 09:36.109
and tagging
famous people
Aha!

09:36.143 --> 09:37.410
so everyone thinks they're here.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.579
Like Josh Hartnett
would really come here.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.615
Anyway,
when she puts it down,

09:41.649 --> 09:43.150
you distract her,
and I'll grab it.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.317
-Well, how do we distract her?
-I don't know.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.286
Ask her about the show
her husband writes for.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.621
"Gotham"?
It's the last season.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.089
I don't want any spoilers.
Mnh-mnh.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.991
Agreed.
This is nuts, Angie.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.425
You're an amazing mom
who's working really hard

09:52.459 --> 09:54.662
to make sure
her son has a great life.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.996
Yeah, just tell her
the truth.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.130
You're proud as hell,

09:57.164 --> 09:58.398
just like the cast and crew
of "Gotham."

09:58.431 --> 09:59.499
Or at least
they should be.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.434
I'm not...
proud, okay?

10:01.468 --> 10:02.469
I'm embarrassed.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.138
This is all
embarrassing.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.439
I haven't even
told Owen.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.941
Angie, I'm so sorry.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.442
Do you want
to talk about it?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.679
No! I'm gonna do
the only thing I can do,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.513
and that's
steal Jackie's phone.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.282
Oh, she just put it down!
Hot screen! Hot screen!

10:15.315 --> 10:17.284
Hot screen! This way.
-Ow, ow, ow.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.251
-Jackie!
-Hey.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.953
-Hi!
-So, again, uh,

10:19.987 --> 10:22.455
such a great party...
Aww, thanks.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.957
...really, and to think
we almost didn't come.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.092
That's really funny.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.626
That's funny.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.828
Jackie:
Oh, I'm so sorry

10:27.861 --> 10:29.697
you didn't find anyone
for your Palentine's Day thing.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.332
Jared was so bummed
he couldn't make it.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.501
-Wait, you asked Jared?
-Now is not the time, Miggy.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.970
-Okay, cool. Mm-hmm.
-What's going on with you guys?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.605
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.674
Nothing.
It's nothing.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.775
Okay, um...

10:41.809 --> 10:43.276
Well, I'm gonna go mingle.
-Mm-hmm.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.812
Maybe you guys
just stay right here.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.446
-Right here. Word. Uh...
-Okay, great.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.217
Jackie! Hi! Oh!
-Why are we hugging?

10:50.250 --> 10:53.486
'Cause it's
Valentine's Day.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.057
Another Negroni,
ma'am?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.992
Five's my limit, ladies.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.062
What's taking your old man
so long?

11:03.931 --> 11:05.999
We've been at this
for an hour, okay?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.535
The boy's a mess.
New strategy.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.204
Graham, why don't you -- why
don't you come sit down with us.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.372
All right.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.541
You know, when I want
to show someone that I care,

11:14.574 --> 11:15.976
I can count on a gift

11:16.009 --> 11:18.178
that's decorative
and healthy --

11:18.211 --> 11:21.314
Fogerty, are you pitching me
Edible Arrangements?!

11:21.348 --> 11:22.883
That's an easy out.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.853
But with Louisa,
there are no easy outs.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.421
Look at the card
she gave me.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.524
"Love is a puzzle.
I've gathered the clues.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.560
Now I know
the answer is Y-O-U."

11:33.593 --> 11:35.195
-Terrific.
-And then on the inside,

11:35.228 --> 11:36.897
there's, like,
an 80-letter palindrome.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.199
She's a genius of love,

11:39.232 --> 11:40.700
a master of riddles.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.536
I'm just a guy
who still can't read a clock.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.372
4:00 A.M.?

11:45.405 --> 11:46.940
I'm ruined.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.441
-Ding dong.
-Oh!

11:48.475 --> 11:50.443
Look, uh,
I'm gonna take a hike.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.445
I didn't come here tonight to
kick it with the "Peanuts" gang.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.114
I-I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just --

11:54.147 --> 11:57.617
This kid here has it really bad
for some twist named Louisa.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.920
But we're almost
out of the weeds.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.422
The sooner we solve it,
the sooner we hit
the road to Sheetsville?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.124
Where you will be
the mayor.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.258
Easy peasy!

12:05.292 --> 12:06.960
Take it from a travel agent
who has booked

12:06.994 --> 12:10.097
over 4,800
unforgettable couples cruises.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.599
All I need
is like 14 bucks

12:12.632 --> 12:14.101
and the holiday aisle
at Rite Aid.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.936
Yes, my queen.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.537
"Hello, Internet"?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.906
"To whom
it may concern"?

12:18.939 --> 12:21.274
Okay, clearly, you've never
written a review before.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.911
Okay, just say it was hands down
the best service you ever had.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.779
Shopping cart emoji.
-Look, if anybody can capture

12:25.813 --> 12:27.881
the voice of
a 40-year-old woman, it's me.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.616
Dude, I just thought
we could do this together.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.884
You know, like pals.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.285
Whoa.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.121
Palentine's Day
is drama-free!

12:34.154 --> 12:35.722
Dude, you're the one
that's bringing the drama!

12:35.755 --> 12:37.791
I'm only here because
everyone else you asked said no.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.460
Sorry for thinking
you actually wanted me around.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.796
Miggy, please don't
make this about you.
This is about Angie.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.965
And how this...

12:44.998 --> 12:49.136
was hands down the best service
I've ever had!

12:49.169 --> 12:50.503
What?
Oh, there's
a shopping cart emoji.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.939
That's so cute.
I literally
just said that.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.606
It's like
you don't even see me!

12:53.640 --> 12:54.774
Angie: Hey. You guys.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.143
Did you fix the...

12:58.145 --> 13:00.513
...fix...the...toilet?

13:00.547 --> 13:01.614
They fix--

13:01.648 --> 13:03.283
They broke the toilet,

13:03.316 --> 13:04.784
and now
they're fixing it.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.287
Angie, I can't find my phone.
Let me borrow yours.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.357
Gimme your phone.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.324
I have to call it.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.461
* Oh! *
Are you playing
"Rhythm of the Night"?

13:14.494 --> 13:15.595
Great song,
but not the time.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.964
I'm not. It's coming
from Jackie's phone.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.365
But I love it, too.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.833
* Forget about the worries
on your mind *

13:19.867 --> 13:21.368
I...
* You can leave them
all behind *

13:21.401 --> 13:23.136
* To the beat
of the rhythm of the night *

13:23.170 --> 13:24.471
* Oh, the rhythm... *

13:24.504 --> 13:25.805
Jackie:
What are you doing?

13:25.839 --> 13:26.874
* ...the night *

13:30.410 --> 13:32.545
To be completely honest, Rory,
no, I wouldn't go

13:32.579 --> 13:35.115
to Mark's grandma's funeral
if it was on your birthday.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.816
Even if he was
visiting Santa Fe?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.118
I don't get it.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.319
Well, clearly!

13:39.352 --> 13:40.954
I mean,
Rory's birthday is sacred,

13:40.988 --> 13:42.622
no matter
what state capital he's in.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.025
Rory: Well, folks,
they came out swinging, but --

13:45.058 --> 13:47.827
Wait. What's that?
Wow.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.863
I am being told
that this is the worst score

13:49.897 --> 13:50.998
in "Scenarios!" history.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.466
We'll return
after this commercial.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.636
Friends, end-of-life planning
isn't easy,

13:56.669 --> 13:57.905
but it can be fun.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.909
At Rory Banks Funeral Home,
the party never ends.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.310
This is
gonna sound crazy,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.711
but "Scenarios!"
has made me realize

14:04.744 --> 14:06.679
that we really aren't
compatible.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.514
Right?
Yeah.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.648
It's weirdly
illuminating.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.549
Yeah!

14:09.582 --> 14:11.184
I mean,
as insane as it is,

14:11.218 --> 14:12.852
it's made me see us
in a whole new light.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.222
Mm-hmm.
You know, when you said
your dream scenario

14:15.255 --> 14:17.557
is to open up your own
private investigation agency --

14:17.590 --> 14:18.591
We'd do it as a team.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.927
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.695
I'm sorry, but I just
don't see myself there.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.731
For what it's worth,
I loved all two weeks of this.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.765
Me too.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.167
And I'm glad we got out
while it's good.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.836
All right, come on.
We're back from commercials.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.238
Time for Round Three!

14:31.271 --> 14:33.440
Rory, some good news.
We're gonna skip Round Three.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.375
Mark and I decided to
stop seeing each other, so...

14:35.408 --> 14:36.876
All thanks
to "Scenarios!"

14:36.910 --> 14:38.578
Yeah.
It's a great game, Rory.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.380
Thanks.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.116
Okay.
That's our show.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.584
Guests of "Scenarios!"
get to stay

14:44.617 --> 14:46.619
at the world-famous
Century Plaza Hotel.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.021
Is this part
of Round Three?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.422
I don't think so.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.125
Someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on here?

14:52.159 --> 14:52.993
Will?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.364
All right, Jackie, the person
who was supposed to deliver

14:57.397 --> 14:58.966
your groceries tonight
is me.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.800
I'm Britney45.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.769
Wait, seriously?

15:02.802 --> 15:04.271
No!

15:04.304 --> 15:07.107
No, Will was just
helping a friend in need.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.576
Me.
I am Britney45.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.778
That's right, 44 other Britneys
joined Beck+Call

15:11.811 --> 15:12.812
before me.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.948
Look, I have no idea
what's happening,

15:14.982 --> 15:16.749
but I have a party
downstairs, and I --

15:16.783 --> 15:18.551
Look, I'm Britney45!

15:18.585 --> 15:20.787
And I did a garbage job
with your groceries!

15:20.820 --> 15:23.957
Thank you, guys,
but I-I gotta own this.

15:23.991 --> 15:28.996
Jackie, I moonlight
as a grocery delivery person.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.131
Things aren't easy.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.133
Money is tight as is, and then
the class trip comes up,

15:33.166 --> 15:36.436
and there's always
some new thing to pay for.

15:36.469 --> 15:40.940
I'm at a low-level
freak out at all times.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.910
So, you know, if you want
to give me zero stars,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.012
go right ahead.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.980
I deal with harder crap
every day.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.249
Oh, Angie.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.450
I hear you.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.453
Yeah, it may seem like
I have the perfect life

15:53.486 --> 15:55.455
and I have
the perfect house,

15:55.488 --> 15:58.791
but there's a reason I started
Jackie Has a Business, LLC.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.329
Financially, things with
Jared and me aren't great.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.531
Oh. I --

16:04.564 --> 16:06.633
I had no idea.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.934
You really get it.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.537
"Gotham" isn't syndicating well
in South America.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.373
I might have to let go
of my Social Media Assistant.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.109
Yeah, no, no, that's --
Your thing is different.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.210
No, we're in
the exact same boat.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.278
I'm giving you
five stars.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.780
No, I don't want
your pity stars, okay?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.882
-Psh.
-You can give me four stars.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.617
If you could
avoid saying

16:24.651 --> 16:27.120
that I threw your food
in the bushes, that'd be great.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.288
You threw my food
in the bushes?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.223
Three stars is fine.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.126
Big Red: No woman can resist
a plush animal.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.662
I got six in my car
rear window right now.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.997
Now get out of here,
you handsome little devil.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.532
Wai-- Wai-- Ba--
Hold on.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.204
God,
kids are nasty.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.540
-Pecan?
-No.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.508
-Caramel?
-No.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.210
-Cherry cordial?
-Come to Mama.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.383
-Douglas, right?
-Yeah.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.485
And this is...Emma --
or Amy.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.886
That's a boy, Phil.

16:59.919 --> 17:03.223
Would it be possible for him
to talk to Louisa, please?

17:03.256 --> 17:06.559
Sure. Um, she's in
her rocking chair.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.561
What if she doesn't like
my Valentine?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.397
Well, you see,
that doesn't matter,

17:10.430 --> 17:12.099
because she likes you.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.401
And if you start to panic,
just tell her...

17:19.106 --> 17:20.073
Greetings.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.108
I'll leave you to it.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.445
Louisa,
you're a 10.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.549
If you're up for it, I know
a great place for a steak.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.585
If you're a vegetarian,
there's a salad bar.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.123
Ranch dressing
as thick as wet concrete.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.425
So be mine,
you gorgeous dame.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.926
Glory be.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.361
Whoa.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.963
Sounds like
someone I know.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.898
Oh, I might've given him
a line or two,

17:45.932 --> 17:47.900
but I'm saving my best stuff
for you.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.104
I have a girlfriend!

17:54.741 --> 17:55.575
Ror?

17:55.608 --> 17:57.410
Hello?
Who's there?

17:57.444 --> 17:59.212
What did I tell you
last week?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.114
No sleep mask
while Mom is talking.

18:01.148 --> 18:01.948
Mm-hmm.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.151
Baby, I'm confused.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.653
Were you rooting for me and Mark
to be together?

18:06.686 --> 18:10.423
I mean, no, I set out to destroy
your relationship, but...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.326
...then I started having fun
with you guys,

18:13.360 --> 18:16.596
and I secretly was hoping
for it to work out.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.465
You deserve
to find love, Mom.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.932
I will.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.768
And hey, now that
we have "Scenarios!",

18:21.801 --> 18:22.935
I might find somebody
sooner.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.606
But today,
will you be my Valentine?

18:26.639 --> 18:27.674
I'd love to.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.775
But we should play
"Scenarios!"

18:28.808 --> 18:30.610
just to make sure
it's right.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.778
Okay,
Rory Denzel Banks,

18:31.811 --> 18:34.181
I'm not playing "Scenarios!"
again today.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.982
Look, when I headed out
tonight,

18:36.015 --> 18:37.317
I didn't care
who I made it with.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.785
I got in my car,
and I drove to the house

18:38.818 --> 18:40.753
of the first man
I could think of.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.022
His wife was home,
so then I tried you.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.457
An honor.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.793
But when I saw you
help out that little rat,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.461
something shifted.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.996
And then that business
on the porch.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.365
Doc, I was a puddle.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.167
I wanna make love
to you.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.302
Then it's settled.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.804
But not tonight.
Not tonight.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.640
I want to slow things down,
make it special.

19:00.673 --> 19:04.277
I want a romance
with the simmering heat

19:04.311 --> 19:06.679
of a four-day/three-night
to Ensenada.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.049
So, are you willing
to wait?

19:10.082 --> 19:11.284
For you? Always.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.652
I mean,
why do it tonight?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.687
Valentine's Day
is for dopes, huh?

19:16.223 --> 19:17.790
I'll call you
tomorrow.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.858
Mnh.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.794
I leave in the A.M.
for a six-month cruise

19:21.828 --> 19:22.995
to the Panama Canal.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.564
Half off.
You don't say no to that.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.398
I would.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.033
Douglas,
I can't sleep.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.702
Looks like
you got your hands full.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.539
I'm gonna go home and finish
a hoagie I got in my fridge.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.341
W-- W--
Mwah.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.043
Call me.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.716
God, you're so little.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.654
I'm feeling something.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.489
I think it's...

19:49.522 --> 19:50.523
jealousy?

19:50.557 --> 19:51.891
I...

19:51.924 --> 19:53.393
I like Graham.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.194
Everybody likes Graham.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.530
He's a lovable sad sack.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.065
No.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.133
I think
I like like Graham.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.837
How are you kids
so emotionally available?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.539
When I was seven,
I had a job.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.946
Thanks for dropping me,
you guys.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.382
I really hope
he's still awake.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.683
Please say hello to Owen
for us.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.451
But time it in a way
it's not weird.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.387
Like before the sex
or way, way after!

20:20.420 --> 20:21.421
You feel me?

20:21.454 --> 20:22.589
-I got it.
-Okay.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.191
Thanks for tonight, guys.
Really.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.626
This was...

20:26.659 --> 20:27.794
not normal.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.398
I guess
now that you've seen me

20:31.431 --> 20:32.799
as a loser
delivery person,

20:32.832 --> 20:34.133
you probably look at me
differently.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.201
Yeah.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.437
I think that
you're pretty remarkable.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.638
Oh, my God,
you're such a dork.

20:38.671 --> 20:39.906
-You're welcome.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.240
Happy Palentine's Day.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.875
-Thank you! Good night!
-Bye, pal!

20:42.909 --> 20:44.043
Have fun!

20:44.076 --> 20:46.245
We'll make sure
you get in safe!

20:46.279 --> 20:48.080
Palentine's Day
isn't officially over.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.982
Yeah, it is.
It's almost midnight.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.984
-Not in Hawaii.
-You're taking me to Hawaii?!

20:52.018 --> 20:53.820
No, that's...not logical.
Oh...

20:53.853 --> 20:55.955
But there's still time
to do this right.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.256
* Oh *

20:57.290 --> 20:59.459
* To the beat
of the rhythm of the night *

20:59.492 --> 21:01.728
* Dance until
the morning light *

21:01.761 --> 21:03.630
* Forget about the worries
on your mind *

21:03.663 --> 21:05.632
* You can leave them
all behind *

21:05.665 --> 21:07.634
* To the beat
of the rhythm of the night *

21:07.667 --> 21:11.838
* Oh, the rhythm
of the night *

21:11.871 --> 21:12.939
* Oh, oh *

21:12.972 --> 21:14.641
Sorry, miss.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.409
Mmm. Pasta.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.477
Sorry.
