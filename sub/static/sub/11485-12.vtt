WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:04.280
Well, Judith, you can't have it both ways.

00:07.824 --> 00:10.258
No, if you want to stay in that house,

00:10.326 --> 00:13.454
and drive that car,
then I have to live here to save money.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.589
No. I don't agree that
he's a bad influence on Jake.

00:22.072 --> 00:24.438
Uncle Charlie,
I understand the point spread,

00:24.507 --> 00:26.975
but I'm still confused about the vig.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.336
Okay.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.711
Vig is short for vigorish,
and it means the percentage you pay

00:32.816 --> 00:36.274
- to a bookie to take your bet.
- So it's better to be a bookie.

00:36.352 --> 00:38.320
My little boy is growing up.

00:40.056 --> 00:41.216
Judith, hang on.

00:41.324 --> 00:44.384
I have got to stop you here,
because right at this very minute,

00:44.494 --> 00:46.655
I am watching Charlie
help Jake with math.

00:49.833 --> 00:53.826
Well, go ahead and call your lawyers,
but I think I am well within my rights here.

00:54.137 --> 00:58.403
Well, I don't know what Jake is telling you
about Charlie's dates,

00:58.508 --> 01:01.705
but he is a kid,
and he blows things out of proportion.

01:01.778 --> 01:04.906
Well, if by nude swimming you mean,

01:05.013 --> 01:08.780
she had no bathing suit on whatsoever,

01:08.918 --> 01:10.408
then that never happened.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.941 --> 01:35.240
I can see the clothes hamper
was a wise purchase.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.040
- Berta?
- No, it's Liz Hurley, but I'm holding water.

01:43.119 --> 01:45.553
I'm still sleeping here.
Could you come back in a little while?

01:45.622 --> 01:47.715
I could,
or you could get your pampered ass

01:47.791 --> 01:49.782
out of bed
and let me do my demeaning job

01:49.893 --> 01:51.952
and get on with my hellish life.

01:53.463 --> 01:56.591
Excuse me, Berta, but last time I checked,
you work for me.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.099
So I'll get up when I'm good and ready.

02:03.473 --> 02:05.907
Sorry I had to pull rank on you.

02:11.481 --> 02:14.609
- Berta, for God's sake!
- Hey, do you want clean towels?

02:14.717 --> 02:17.447
- But I'm trying to do something here.
- So do it.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.249
Well, I can't do it now.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.053
Is something wrong?

02:25.128 --> 02:28.097
I mean, beyond the usual
demeaning-job hellish-life stuff?

02:28.164 --> 02:29.392
Do you really want to know?

02:29.899 --> 02:31.799
No, but I'm up and my bed's gone.

02:32.836 --> 02:35.862
Okay. So I told you
about my daughter, right?

02:35.972 --> 02:38.133
- You have a daughter?
- I have three.

02:38.274 --> 02:39.866
Three? Wow.

02:41.611 --> 02:43.670
You gotta start learning to say no,
little lady.

02:47.984 --> 02:49.281
Hey, Berta. Morning.

02:49.352 --> 02:53.288
Now, you know I hate to criticize,
but the coffee filters you've been buying

02:53.356 --> 02:54.448
have chemicals in them.

02:55.792 --> 02:57.555
And I love it!

02:58.795 --> 02:59.887
Get out of my way.

03:02.732 --> 03:06.327
- What's wrong with her?
- Apparently she has children.

03:08.171 --> 03:11.197
And one of them showed up last night
and left her little girl,

03:11.307 --> 03:13.172
who I have to drag with me everywhere

03:13.243 --> 03:15.302
because I can't leave her alone
in the house.

03:15.378 --> 03:17.039
- So you brought her here?
- Yeah.

03:17.146 --> 03:18.670
Is that gonna be a problem?

03:20.149 --> 03:21.480
- No.
- That's wonderful.

03:21.551 --> 03:23.314
- Happy to have her.
- Yeah.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.320
- So where is she?
- She's playing with Jake.

03:26.389 --> 03:27.981
Good. A little playmate for Jake.

03:28.057 --> 03:30.150
That'll give him something to do for today.

03:30.226 --> 03:32.694
I hope they're quiet
'cause I got a lot of work to do.

03:32.762 --> 03:35.492
Nana, did you throw out
my cigarettes again?

03:39.869 --> 03:41.393
- Dear God!
- Oh, hell!

03:43.206 --> 03:44.935
Prudence, you're 16 years old.

03:45.041 --> 03:48.670
You want to end up on a breathing
machine like your Uncle Chick?

03:48.745 --> 03:51.771
- Mom lets me smoke.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

03:51.881 --> 03:54.372
No reason I shouldn't trust
the judgment of a woman

03:54.450 --> 03:58.409
who's off selling bootleg Metallica t-shirts
at a monster truck rally.

03:59.389 --> 04:01.254
Mom sounds like a real go-getter.

04:01.691 --> 04:03.852
So what am I supposed to do here all day?

04:03.927 --> 04:06.555
You're supposed to help me clean,
that's what. Here.

04:06.629 --> 04:08.620
You can start with his toilet.

04:12.135 --> 04:13.227
Hi.

04:14.370 --> 04:17.134
- I'm Alan.
- Hi, Alan.

04:18.808 --> 04:20.798
What kind of car do you drive?

04:21.444 --> 04:25.904
- A Volvo station wagon.
- What do you got?

04:27.951 --> 04:30.419
I got nothing. Not a damn thing.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.814
Hey, Prudence, I set up my Xbox.
You ready to play?

04:33.923 --> 04:36.653
- Sure.
- Get to work, Prudence!

04:37.460 --> 04:41.157
Maybe later, handsome.
Stupid old woman.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.164
Isn't she wonderful?

04:47.503 --> 04:48.970
- Dear God.
- Oh, hell.

05:04.020 --> 05:07.012
Well, I'd better get started on that work

05:11.227 --> 05:14.458
I have... to do.

05:16.833 --> 05:20.496
Yeah, I gotta catch up on some
paperwork that

05:21.037 --> 05:24.063
has to do with the office.

05:28.878 --> 05:30.971
- Oh, yeah. Your job.
- Yeah.

05:35.218 --> 05:36.583
Your chiropractor job.

05:37.887 --> 05:41.015
Yeah and you'll be, what,
you'll be writing a jingle?

05:44.193 --> 05:48.357
Yeah. Potato chips. You know, the...

05:49.599 --> 05:51.157
The ones in the can.

05:52.168 --> 05:53.362
Yeah.

05:54.670 --> 05:56.194
I like those.

06:05.581 --> 06:06.946
All right, then.

06:09.352 --> 06:13.789
- I'm gonna go over to the piano now.
- Yeah, and I'm gonna go to the

06:14.290 --> 06:17.748
kitchen and... Yeah.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.678
Hey, you play piano?

06:43.252 --> 06:44.344
Yes.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.763
You're pretty good.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.926
Thanks.

06:59.035 --> 07:02.664
- Are you in a band?
- No.

07:03.539 --> 07:07.202
I used to go out with a bass player.
He wrote this beautiful song for me,

07:07.310 --> 07:09.801
<i>called Dear Prudence.</i>

07:12.648 --> 07:15.845
Yeah, that sounds like something
a bass player would do.

07:16.786 --> 07:19.516
You know, I've always wanted
to play the piano.

07:20.289 --> 07:22.814
Do you think you could
teach me something?

07:24.961 --> 07:27.020
Nope, nothing, not a damn thing.

07:29.799 --> 07:33.200
So, do you have a girlfriend?

07:33.336 --> 07:35.861
Me? Oh, yeah. Big-time girlfriend.

07:36.405 --> 07:38.236
We're practically engaged.

07:38.474 --> 07:40.840
Prudence, he's old enough
to be your father.

07:40.910 --> 07:42.878
And knowing your mother, he might be.

07:44.747 --> 07:49.411
- Just wash the damn windows.
- I'm not your father.

07:52.355 --> 07:54.880
How do you stand her? She's such a bitch.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.022
Don't talk like that
about your grandmother.

07:58.094 --> 08:01.689
Hey, you don't know her.
She's all sweet and nice with you.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.756
Yeah.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.659
She's a real gumdrop.

08:08.237 --> 08:12.037
My point is, you've gotta respect her
because she loves you and

08:13.409 --> 08:16.344
I've seen her pick up the stove
to vacuum under it.

08:18.681 --> 08:20.171
Oh, hey, look!

08:20.349 --> 08:22.681
There's Rose, my girlfriend.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.354
Come on in, baby.

08:28.457 --> 08:29.515
Okay.

08:31.460 --> 08:35.590
Rose, this is Berta's 16-year-old
granddaughter, Prudence.

08:36.032 --> 08:40.434
Prudence, this is my girlfriend, who
I'm free to take across state lines, Rose.

08:49.045 --> 08:51.377
- Wow, look at that kiss!
- What?

08:52.415 --> 08:54.440
Oh, thank God.

08:55.885 --> 08:58.046
Berta, does Prudence have a boyfriend?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.111
Oh, honey, don't get me started.

09:00.223 --> 09:01.417
What does that mean?

09:01.524 --> 09:04.789
It means if she gets a high-school diploma
before she gets a baby,

09:04.894 --> 09:07.021
she'll be the first one in the family.

09:09.232 --> 09:11.223
I'm thirsty. What's to drink?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.201
The Cransylvania Goofy Juice is mine,
but you can have one.

09:14.270 --> 09:16.067
Oh, thanks, handsome.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.537
Is this beer for anybody?

09:17.607 --> 09:21.543
- Prudence, you're 16.
- You know, Prudence,

09:21.611 --> 09:24.808
the Goofy Juice has vitamin C
and calcium.

09:24.914 --> 09:28.042
It's much better than beer
for a growing body.

09:29.785 --> 09:32.913
Not that your body needs to grow.

09:36.726 --> 09:37.886
I'm done.

09:39.795 --> 09:42.593
You know, Prudence,
I'm the third fastest runner in my class.

09:42.898 --> 09:45.799
- Cool!
- Spring break's over. Back to work.

09:46.269 --> 09:47.463
Later, stud.

09:48.738 --> 09:51.070
Boy, she smells good.

09:51.941 --> 09:54.671
Yeah, if you like Camel Filters
and pheromones.

09:55.745 --> 09:58.270
I gotta do some grocery shopping
for your brother.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.338
I'll be back in a little while.

10:00.449 --> 10:02.314
- What about Prudence?
- She'll be fine.

10:02.418 --> 10:04.283
Just keep her out of the liquor cabinet.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.446
Don't do anything stupid
or you'll go to jail.

10:08.924 --> 10:12.416
- Why would you go to jail?
- Well, that's kind of complicated.

10:12.495 --> 10:14.622
And why was Uncle Charlie kissing Rose?

10:14.697 --> 10:17.860
- Well, that was the...
- And what are pherobones?

10:17.967 --> 10:20.959
That one I know,
and it's pronounced pheromones...

10:22.805 --> 10:23.999
Never mind.

10:34.684 --> 10:37.551
Wow, you're really good at that.

10:39.655 --> 10:42.556
Thanks. I took some cosmetology courses.

10:42.658 --> 10:46.219
I figure I'll be a beautician,
or a supermodel.

10:47.963 --> 10:49.123
Cool.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.900
- You want another Goofy Juice?
- Aren't you the sweetest.

11:02.144 --> 11:04.044
That's twice he's done that.

11:04.180 --> 11:07.206
You gotta admit,
she did a nice job on those windows.

11:12.888 --> 11:15.550
Jake, you need to get started
on that book report.

11:15.658 --> 11:18.650
- But Prudence is thirsty.
- I'll take care of Prudence.

11:18.728 --> 11:20.821
- Come on, get going.
- Man!

11:22.331 --> 11:24.731
- Charlie, you want to...
- Not a chance in hell.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.095
Remember when you used to say that
about us?

11:46.188 --> 11:49.351
- Here.
- Thanks.

11:50.092 --> 11:51.423
Where's my little pal?

11:51.527 --> 11:56.021
- He has work to do. Kind of like you.
- Are you gonna tell on me?

11:58.067 --> 11:59.898
No, it was just...

12:01.203 --> 12:03.296
Just an observation.

12:03.406 --> 12:06.136
Just calling them as I see them.

12:09.211 --> 12:11.111
Glean from it what you will.

12:12.615 --> 12:16.415
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not really sure anymore.

12:18.454 --> 12:21.150
But I do want you to know that

12:21.490 --> 12:24.982
I understand how angry
and powerless you feel.

12:25.428 --> 12:27.555
Believe it or not,
I was a teenager once, too.

12:28.230 --> 12:32.758
And I can remember what it's like
to rebel against parental authority.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.066
Or in your case, grandparental authority.

12:37.306 --> 12:39.501
- Can you put some of this on my back?
- No.

12:41.811 --> 12:43.642
If you don't, I'll burn.

12:43.746 --> 12:45.338
If I do, I will.

12:51.153 --> 12:55.317
- Judith. What a surprise.
- Hello, Charlie.

12:58.461 --> 12:59.621
So,

13:01.363 --> 13:03.991
- what's new?
- Where's Jake?

13:04.099 --> 13:06.192
In his room, doing a book report.

13:06.302 --> 13:09.601
Well, how can he do a book report
when he left the book at my house?

13:09.672 --> 13:13.836
That little dickens.
Trying to pull the wool over our eyes.

13:13.943 --> 13:18.937
- I'll take care of this right now. Bye.
- Charlie, I want to see Jake.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.372
Sure. Hang on.

13:23.452 --> 13:26.615
Jake? Your mother's here!

13:37.967 --> 13:41.801
- What?
- Your mom's here. Talk to your mom.

13:43.472 --> 13:45.030
- Here he is.
- Hi, Mom.

13:45.140 --> 13:47.665
Hi, sweetie.
Are you having a fun weekend?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.836
You know Berta,
Uncle Charlie's housekeeper...

13:49.912 --> 13:52.745
Of course she knows her.
Who doesn't know Berta?

13:52.848 --> 13:55.976
- She brought her granddaughter over.
- Yeah. Sweet little kid.

13:56.051 --> 13:58.019
That's nice.
Have you been playing with her?

13:58.087 --> 14:01.420
Oh, yeah. I mean, he has. Not me.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.821
Hey, Judith. What's up?

14:05.895 --> 14:10.059
Well, it turns out this little rascal
was pulling a fast one on us.

14:10.299 --> 14:12.631
Doing a book report without the book.

14:13.802 --> 14:17.863
Oh, Jake. All right, young man,
you get to work right now.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.974
- Jake?
- Oh, yeah.

14:25.915 --> 14:27.746
So, thanks for stopping by.

14:27.850 --> 14:30.478
I guess I'll see you
when you come to pick him up.

14:30.553 --> 14:33.044
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. What?

14:34.156 --> 14:35.589
Oh, hi, Judith.

14:35.691 --> 14:39.354
Did you hear the good news?
Charlie and I are back together.

14:39.595 --> 14:41.028
Oh, really?

14:42.097 --> 14:44.258
Yep. That's what's going on here.

14:44.833 --> 14:48.064
Well, just show a little discretion
in front of my son, Charlie.

14:48.170 --> 14:49.330
Absolutely.

14:49.405 --> 14:52.499
- You got that, Rose? Discretion.
- Got it, Monkey Man.

15:00.516 --> 15:02.950
I think I have a concussion.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.722
Thanks for helping me
with my book report, Prudence.

15:11.794 --> 15:14.729
Oh, no problem.
Fourth-grade stuff is easy for me.

15:15.764 --> 15:18.028
Should be, you did it twice.

15:18.801 --> 15:20.735
Let's go before we miss the bus.

15:20.803 --> 15:23.271
- Later, handsome.
- Bye.

15:29.878 --> 15:32.278
So, what are we doing tonight, sweetie?

15:35.484 --> 15:37.782
Rose, I really appreciate your help,

15:37.920 --> 15:40.912
but you don't have to pretend
to be my girlfriend anymore.

15:42.591 --> 15:43.819
Oh, no.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.558
Are you pretending to break up with me?

15:58.140 --> 16:01.007
2:00 in the morning. This better be God.

16:04.079 --> 16:05.239
Oh, God.

16:07.116 --> 16:08.310
Hey.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.977
Prudence, what the hell
are you doing here?

16:11.086 --> 16:13.919
- I had a fight with my grandmother.
- So?

16:14.123 --> 16:17.615
When I have a fight with my grandmother,
I don't come to your house.

16:17.926 --> 16:20.451
I know, I'm sorry.
I just didn't know where else to go

16:20.529 --> 16:22.793
and I thought you were cool.

16:23.699 --> 16:28.102
Look, Prudence, this just can't happen.

16:28.671 --> 16:32.607
I mean, you're very nice and pretty,
but in prison, so am I.

16:34.643 --> 16:37.373
Bitching house, man.
You should rent it to MTV.

16:39.448 --> 16:42.178
- Who the hell are you?
- What's going on?

16:43.986 --> 16:48.047
Put down the toothbrush, Alan,
we've got bigger problems than gingivitis.

16:48.857 --> 16:51.223
What's she doing here?
Who the hell is this?

16:51.326 --> 16:54.386
This is Freddie. My fiancé.

16:56.031 --> 16:58.124
- 'Sup.
- 'Sup?

16:58.200 --> 16:59.792
I'll tell you what's 'sup. I'm 'sup.

16:59.868 --> 17:01.733
And I should be seeping. Sleeping.

17:01.837 --> 17:03.395
What's going on here?

17:03.872 --> 17:07.501
Well, Freddie came over to announce
our engagement, and Nana threw him out.

17:07.576 --> 17:10.636
Really? She didn't take a shine
to Bazooka Joe here?

17:11.547 --> 17:14.380
You know,
I'm kind of more of an acquired taste.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.013
So we just need a place to crash tonight

17:17.086 --> 17:19.748
because tomorrow we're gonna go
to Vegas and get married.

17:19.855 --> 17:22.380
- Oh, Prudence, that's a terrible idea.
- Yeah.

17:22.491 --> 17:25.085
If you leave right now,
you can beat the traffic.

17:25.928 --> 17:27.224
We can't go tonight.

17:27.329 --> 17:30.025
He's gotta pick up his last paycheck
from the photomat.

17:30.099 --> 17:32.533
Yeah, $218.

17:32.601 --> 17:35.069
I'll give you $300 to leave right now.

17:36.105 --> 17:38.835
- Charlie, we can't let them go.
- Why not?

17:38.907 --> 17:41.102
Because they're stupid and they'll die.

17:42.177 --> 17:44.941
- What's going on?
- Hey, handsome.

17:45.914 --> 17:48.610
- Who's he?
- This is Freddie, my fiancé.

17:48.717 --> 17:53.051
- You're marrying him?
- Freddie, this is Jake.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.051
'Sup.

17:58.594 --> 18:01.563
Charlie, I saw the lights come on,
is everything okay?

18:01.630 --> 18:03.598
Yeah, Rose, everything's fine.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.933
She's your girlfriend
but she doesn't sleep here?

18:07.136 --> 18:09.366
Yeah, what's up with that, Charlie?

18:11.240 --> 18:14.403
- I told you they'd be here.
- Come here, you little snot bubble.

18:14.476 --> 18:16.774
What do you think you're doing
with my baby girl?

18:16.879 --> 18:18.369
Mom, leave him alone! I love him.

18:18.447 --> 18:20.972
Give me a break, Prudence.
You're 16 years old,

18:21.083 --> 18:24.246
and your hormones are doing
all your thinking for you.

18:24.319 --> 18:25.752
Hi, you must be Charlie.

18:27.089 --> 18:28.113
Hi.

18:28.223 --> 18:30.453
- That's it, we're outta here.
- But, Mom...

18:30.559 --> 18:32.049
- Grandma!
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

18:32.127 --> 18:35.756
- Can I at least give him my number?
- He's got your number, sweetheart.

18:40.903 --> 18:42.564
I guess I'll take the couch.

18:42.638 --> 18:44.230
Okay, I'm going!

18:44.606 --> 18:46.301
Don't you ever come back!

18:47.609 --> 18:49.577
Ready for bed, lamb chop?

18:51.613 --> 18:53.444
It was worth a shot.

18:59.254 --> 19:00.949
- Is Mom here yet?
- No.

19:01.356 --> 19:04.848
- Sit down a minute, Jake, okay?
- Did I do something wrong?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.427
No.

19:06.495 --> 19:11.023
- We just want to talk.
- Okay. What do you want to talk about?

19:11.500 --> 19:14.936
Well, you know how I've always told
you that you should always tell

19:15.003 --> 19:17.665
your parents the truth, no matter what?

19:18.207 --> 19:19.868
Well, forget it.

19:21.610 --> 19:24.374
Charlie. Jake, it's just that...

19:24.513 --> 19:27.641
We're just saying a lot of things
happened here this weekend,

19:27.716 --> 19:31.482
and it's not really necessary
that your mother know about them.

19:31.787 --> 19:33.220
So you want me to lie?

19:33.322 --> 19:35.552
No, it's not really lying.

19:38.026 --> 19:40.392
When a boy becomes a man,

19:42.331 --> 19:44.390
and that's what you're becoming.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.191
- Right, Charlie?
- Oh, yeah, a man.

19:49.371 --> 19:53.205
He has to start protecting the women
in his life from certain things.

19:53.308 --> 19:54.366
Like the truth.

19:55.310 --> 19:56.743
Do you understand?

19:56.845 --> 19:59.643
I think so.
You don't want Mom to know about

19:59.715 --> 20:01.649
Prudence and her boyfriend
and everything.

20:02.918 --> 20:04.249
Good man.

20:09.992 --> 20:11.721
- Hi, Judith.
- Hello, Alan.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.088
- Charlie.
- Judith.

20:13.195 --> 20:14.685
- You ready to go, sweetheart?
- Yep.

20:14.763 --> 20:16.230
How was your weekend?

20:16.331 --> 20:18.697
Uncle Charlie says I don't have to tell you.

20:52.801 --> 20:53.995
