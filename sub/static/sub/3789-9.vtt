01:12.489 --> 01:15.199
- Is it a beautiful day or what?
- That's a good one, Drama.

01:15.284 --> 01:18.327
You aren't seriously gonna
wear that flag, are you?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.581
When Pavarotti plays the El Rey,
you can wear the Italian flag.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.958
When my Irish brethren come to town,

01:24.042 --> 01:25.501
I wear this.

01:25.878 --> 01:29.213
Hey, Johnny, you know U2 was
the first concert you ever took me to.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.466
Joshua Tree tour,
he snuck me out of a window.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.176
- I was seven.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.178
- Excuse me.
- I got pulled over on the L.I.E.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.929
I thought we were gonna miss the show.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.098
You were driving when Vince was seven?

01:39.183 --> 01:41.058
How fucking old are you, Drama?

01:41.143 --> 01:42.435
31. Get off my ass.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.729
31, Drama? Yeah, in dog years maybe.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.231
Hey, guys, come on. It's his birthday.
Leave him alone.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.193
- Give me a second with E.
- I hate it when you guys do that.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.737
U2 rules!

01:54.490 --> 01:56.949
I've been thinking
about this Mandy thing all night.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.826
Forget it. I want her to do the movie.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.287
Now you want her to do it?
What happened at dinner last night?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.539
Nothing.
It was just weird to see her, that's all.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.374
- It's gonna be good though.
- You sure?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.418
Yeah, I'm sure. Don't even mention it to Ari.

02:07.503 --> 02:10.420
- Okay.
- You already mentioned it to him.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.840
I might have sent him
a panicked e-mail at 4:00 A.M.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.759
I can't get Mandy Moore off this movie.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.804
How are the seats, Ari?
'Cause I need to be able to see Bono.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.472
- You know what I mean?
- Ari, it's fine.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.849
I was being an asshole yesterday.
I have no bad feelings for her.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.476
In fact, I have no feelings at all.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.478
Excellent! Boom! Let's make a movie.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.480
Yeah, let's.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.148
So how are those seats?

02:29.233 --> 02:32.318
They're nosebleeds.
Just like you like them, right?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.987
"Floor level or bust. " That's my motto.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.823
I thought it was, "Will act for food. "

02:37.449 --> 02:39.242
Before this thing starts
let's get down to a little business.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.329
Vinnie, the studio wants
to see you in San Diego.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.331
- What's in San Diego?
- Shamu.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.583
- Comic-Con.
- Comic-Con?

02:47.668 --> 02:50.253
Ain't that that comic book geek-fest
you go to every year?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.839
That's no geek-fest.
That's my bread and butter.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.675
I make $1,800 a day selling autties.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.885
You sell German cars there?

02:57.970 --> 03:01.138
Autographs, dickbag!
I've been begging you guys to come for years.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.015
We've been laughing in your face for years

03:03.100 --> 03:04.934
because we don't like comic book geeks.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.145
You better start if you want to
live off Aquaman for the next 50 years.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.773
The studio wants
to introduce Aquaman there.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.192
They think these geeks
can make or break a movie

03:13.277 --> 03:15.111
- a year before it opens.
- I don't really wanna go.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.155
They don't pay you to act.
They pay you to promote.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.949
Cameron would be there himself

03:20.033 --> 03:22.451
if he wasn't overseeing
the construction of the water tank.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.662
- He's not going?
- No. It's just you and Aquagirl.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.414
You're gonna make a big splash.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.666
- Mandy's going?
- Yes!

03:30.836 --> 03:32.378
What the hell?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.213
We'll make a weekend out of it.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.965
I thought you had no feelings for this girl.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.134
I don't. I'm going for Johnny.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.553
- Sure you are.
- Comic-Con and U2!

03:40.637 --> 03:42.805
That's a big birthday, huh, Johnny Drama?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.891
Not bad, Ari, not bad.
Now where are those seats?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.393
Right here. Take a look at that!

03:49.313 --> 03:50.479
Very funny.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.607
Clippers' tickets for Thursday night.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.526
- Stop fucking around, Ari.
- Are you serious?

03:55.611 --> 03:57.194
You've got to be shitting me!

03:57.279 --> 03:59.280
You're kidding, right?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.657
Jesus Christ. Ari Gold.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.326
You just got demoted to silver.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.081
I will never forgive Ari for this. Never.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.000
Would you let it go already, Drama?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.586
I would've bought the tickets myself
if he hadn't promised them.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.422
Drama, we could've gone.
You just refused to scalp.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.466
We could've had great seats for 200 a pop.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.178
Scalping raises ticket prices
so the average fan can't afford them.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.473
U2 stands up for the common man
and so do I.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.183
You are the common man, Drama.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.060
More like an uncommon loser.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.537
- Hey, Robbie.
- Welcome back, Mr. Chase.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.623
- How are you, pal?
- Mr. Chase?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.083
I'll handle this myself.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.877
As always.
- This place is horrifying.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.588
- What are you talking about?
- There's my superhero!

04:57.673 --> 05:00.299
Hey, Shauna. You spinning a little story

05:00.384 --> 05:02.718
how the Chase brothers are
conquering Comic-Con?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.471
No, I'm gonna spin a story
that you really aren't Vince's brother.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.057
Johnny! Johnny Chase!

05:09.393 --> 05:12.019
- How are you?
- Vanessa!

05:12.104 --> 05:15.231
At Comic-Con, Shauna,
I think I'm Johnny's brother.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.691
Yeah, how're you doing?

05:16.775 --> 05:18.818
- How have you been?
- You look great.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.486
- Are you here for the signing?
- Yeah!

05:20.570 --> 05:22.321
Great. What time are you at your booth?

05:22.406 --> 05:25.032
Well, every year I do night signings
from 7:00 to 9:00.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.284
Oh, great. I'm 6:00 to 8:00, so we'll overlap.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.662
- I'll see you then. We'll catch up.
- Definitely.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.331
- It's good to see you.
- All right, I'll see you later.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.667
- Drama.
- That's a beautiful woman.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.336
- Nice.
- I hate that bitch.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.506
Vanessa Angel.
She did three eps of Viking Quest

05:40.590 --> 05:43.092
and then they just gave her
this shitbag spin off.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.803
She's been riding the Viking Quest wave
for a decade.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.180
- So have you.
- Didn't Angel Quest

05:48.265 --> 05:50.641
run five times longer than Viking Quest?

05:50.726 --> 05:53.477
Yeah, but only 'cause
she showed her tits in Playboy.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.147
Either way, Johnny,
I think the Angel likes you.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.815
Yeah, she's beautiful too, Drama.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.275
Well, not in my eyes she's not.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.736
Okay, Vincent, back to real world issues.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.655
You've got the R.J. Spencer
interview at 2:00 P.M.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.199
He thinks he's Mike Wallace,
so he may throw you a hardball or two.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.869
Yeah, Vince,
just take a deep breath and answer.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.538
I might get some tough questions
this weekend also.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.582
Like whether you're still in the business?

06:14.666 --> 06:16.375
Do you even know who R.J. Spencer is?

06:16.460 --> 06:19.587
Yeah, he's the guy that said
the best thing about Head On was my hair.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.839
That's 'cause
you wouldn't talk to him in Paris.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.383
The guy just wants access.
You be nice, he'll be nice.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.844
I'm gonna tell him
he's a fat comic book-loving prick.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.513
This guy's got a website
that gets a million hits a day.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.724
He can sink a movie faster than Stephen Dorff.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.726
Hey, watch it, asshole! That's my client!

06:33.810 --> 06:36.103
Just look at the guy like a prom date.
You buy him a corsage,

06:36.188 --> 06:39.023
- he'll at least give you a handjob.
- Who wants a handjob?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.150
Would you shut up, already, you and you?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.903
- He'll be nice. Don't worry about that.
- Good.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.323
Here's information on Aquaman in case
you don't know anything about it.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.658
Oh, yeah, he's a strong swimmer, right?

06:50.285 --> 06:53.120
Vince. Mandy, three o'clock.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.247
Bro, don't even look at her.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.042
- Just freeze her out.
- No, Vince, lock eyes with her.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.920
- Don't break. Alpha male.
- Will you idiots shut up?

07:01.213 --> 07:03.756
He's trying to make a movie with her,
not trying to bang her.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.257
You looked!

07:06.426 --> 07:07.635
I'll be right back.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.345
Yo, eye of the tiger, Vin.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.597
Hi!

07:11.681 --> 07:14.016
- Hey. Hello.
- How are you?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.311
Vince, this is my fiancÃ© Chris.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.897
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
Hi.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.817
Yeah, you, as well.
This is pretty exciting stuff, huh?

07:22.901 --> 07:23.943
I know, very exciting.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.529
It should be a big announcement.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.241
Maybe we could all grab a drink later?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.368
- Sure.
- Yeah, maybe.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.245
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.496
See you later.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.457
Vince! Vince!

07:39.000 --> 07:40.626
Would you like to come to dinner with us?

07:40.710 --> 07:43.087
- Us?
- Chris and I.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.798
It would really mean a lot to me
if you guys got along.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.550
I'm sorry, I just...

07:47.634 --> 07:49.927
- I need you guys to get along.
- Yeah, of course.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.387
- Okay?
- Sure. Bye.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.264
- I'll see you later then.
- Okay.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.765
Who the fuck cares what she needs?

07:54.975 --> 07:58.727
I've done at least a dozen movies
with women who couldn't stand me.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.521
But it's never affected the work.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.482
They need to be friends if they're going
to spend the next nine months together.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.818
Vince needs to make her
fall back in love with him

08:05.902 --> 08:08.612
and then crush her like she crushed him.
Payback time!

08:08.697 --> 08:11.490
No, what Vince needs to do
is never talk to her

08:11.575 --> 08:12.700
except during work.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.327
And even then, only during takes.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.247
Guys, you need to stop filling his head
with this shit.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.416
What, do you think I listen to them?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.793
What, you don't?
Johnny Chase?

08:22.878 --> 08:25.045
Hey, Jess, how you doin', baby?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.338
Good. How are you?

08:26.423 --> 08:28.007
- Good.
- Good.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.593
This is my brother Vince.
And these are the other guys.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.178
It's a pleasure to meet you, Jess.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.804
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.140
These are my girls, Devon and Teagan.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.017
- Hey.
- How're you doin'?

08:38.101 --> 08:40.019
So what brings you to Dork-a-palooza?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.895
Well, I'm doing my Viking Quest thing

08:41.980 --> 08:44.815
and Vince is here to promote Aquaman.
What are you doing in town?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.359
Promoting my new comic book, Pussy Patrol.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.944
Nice.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.821
It's me and the girls.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.157
We lick ass by day and kick ass by night.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.284
Sweet.
- You should come by the booth.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.536
Yeah, as long as we get there by nightfall.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.371
Cool. So I'll see you there?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.624
- Yeah, definitely.
- Bye, Vince.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.251
- Bye, girls.
Bye-bye.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.049
How the fuck do you know Jesse Jane?

09:10.133 --> 09:13.010
You know how much Lubriderm
I burned through on that broad?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.013
- Johnny, did you ever get with her?
- No, I wish.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.932
Please tell me you've never been in a porno.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.060
No, we used to be in a scene study class
at Howard Fine Studio.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.437
- She's got great timing.
- We're gonna go to this meeting.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.565
- What're you guys gonna do?
- Every year I like to take a day

09:26.650 --> 09:28.943
and soak in some sun.
It always freaks people out

09:29.027 --> 09:31.237
at my booth when Tarvold is tan.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.697
It freaks me out
that people actually go to your booth.

09:35.325 --> 09:39.912
All right, well, thanks for taking
the time to sit down with me, Vince.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.580
Oh, no, R.J., my pleasure.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.958
Hey, I felt awful when I missed you in Paris.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.918
Yeah, I thought you were blowing me off.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.338
Not at all.
I tried the cell phone you gave me 10 times.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.423
You know how
these international phones are.

09:51.508 --> 09:55.761
So, Vince, have you always been
a fan of Aquaman?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.764
Oh, yeah. Since I was a kid.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.433
But I have to say it really took hold for me

10:01.518 --> 10:03.936
when Fradon started doing the illustrations.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.938
It think it took a woman's point of view

10:06.022 --> 10:08.232
to really capture Aquaman's sensitivities.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.150
Yes.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.987
- He's good.
- The best.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.032
Here, bro.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.994
- Anyone looking at me?
- No.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.955
Keep watching. Someone will.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.707
Tarvold?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.252
- Tarvold?
- It's on.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.212
- Yes?
- Can we get a picture with you?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.298
My booth opens at 6:00 P.M.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.383
Autographs $10, pictures $20.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.593
I have a flight at 5:00.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.387
Maybe next year, son.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.222
I need my rest before game time.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.516
Come on.
You're my favorite Viking Quest character.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.436
- I even bought my own helmet.
- Oh, yeah?

10:46.104 --> 10:47.896
Let me see that thing.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.566
Oh, she's a beaut.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.735
No horns.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.322
You know, it was only a myth
that Viking helmets had horns on them.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.824
- One picture, please.
- 40 bucks for the exclusive.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.285
- Done.
- Nah, I'll do it for nothing.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.495
'Cause you guys are real fans.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.539
Can I get one Viking call?

11:05.623 --> 11:07.541
Come on, we're in civilian waters here.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.792
Please.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.253
All right, I'll do one.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.423
Victory!

11:16.468 --> 11:18.344
Yes! Awesome! Sweet, man!

11:18.428 --> 11:20.012
Come on, let's get this over with.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.349
Hey, Johnny, you should put on sunblock.
You're getting a little red.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.517
Thanks.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.353
Is that the Angel?

11:27.437 --> 11:29.980
Sorry, Tarvold. Vanessa! Vanessa Angel!

11:31.066 --> 11:32.191
Hey.

11:35.445 --> 11:39.198
So tell me about your co-star Mandy Moore.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.201
Oh, she's great.
I'm very excited to work with her.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.286
Again, don't you mean?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.998
Yeah, I did a small part
in A Walk to Remember.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.959
Yeah. You guys were pretty serious
there for a while, right?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.753
Serious?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.922
- Oh, Jesus.
- Remain calm.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.298
Dating-wise?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.760
Well, we went out a couple times.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.596
I wouldn't call it serious.
But we're great friends now.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.557
I mean, you did ask her to marry you

12:05.642 --> 12:08.227
after five weeks, so...

12:08.311 --> 12:10.646
And she said no.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.981
Okay, interview's over.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.401
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an asshole, that's why.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.902
Jesus Christ! Vincent!

12:16.986 --> 12:18.904
What the fuck was that, R. J?

12:18.988 --> 12:22.241
What, Shauna? I'm a journalist!
I'm asking questions!

12:22.325 --> 12:25.077
That little comment
just cost you your opening weekend!

12:25.161 --> 12:26.662
Aqua-fag!

12:27.831 --> 12:29.873
- You asked her to marry you?
- Yeah, so what?

12:29.958 --> 12:33.085
I'm your best friend since we were
six-years-old. I never heard this.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.795
I'm like your West Coast mother.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.839
- I can't believe you didn't tell me.
- I never told anyone.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.216
- I'm not anyone.
- What do you want to hear?

12:39.300 --> 12:41.677
That I got humiliated?
That I curled up into a little ball

12:41.761 --> 12:44.179
- like you usually do?
- Oh, hey, fuck you!

12:44.264 --> 12:47.433
I don't have to take that shit from
some jerkoffjust 'cause he has a PC!

12:47.517 --> 12:49.601
Yes, you do!
That's why they pay you what they do!

12:49.686 --> 12:52.354
That's why I didn't want this girl
in this movie, 'cause she'd fuck up

12:52.439 --> 12:54.440
- your professional judgment!
- This wasn't professional,

12:54.524 --> 12:56.692
- this was personal.
- This is not good.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.195
- We've got to fix this.
- Get out your toolbox and fix it!

13:01.698 --> 13:04.074
You should go out with the Angel,
I'm telling you!

13:04.159 --> 13:07.786
Please, you know I don't like
classically beautiful women.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.205
Give me a nice nose break or a lazy eye.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.957
You're insane.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.376
Enough about the Angel. Here.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.172
- Test me again.
- Come on, you're ruining my weekend.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.341
Come on, these fans will tear me apart
if I don't know this shit.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.218
Pass me the baby oil.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.013
Maybe you should put on a little sunblock.

13:26.097 --> 13:29.057
- Test! Test!
- All right, fine.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.938
Who is your mortal enemy?

13:35.023 --> 13:37.566
Thorfinn Skullsplitter. Next.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.611
What's the name of Tarvold's ship?

13:41.404 --> 13:44.198
The Gokstad!
Jesus, Turtle, challenge me a little.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.699
Okay.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.953
Where was Tarvold born?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.164
Northumbria.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.960
- It was Orkney.
- Bullshit!

13:57.045 --> 13:59.004
- Let me see that thing.
- You forced me into doing this,

13:59.088 --> 14:01.340
and now you're calling me a liar. Fine, take it!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.342
Okay, I believe you.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.177
Orkney, huh?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.304
Huh. Orkney?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.394
Who is it?
- Hi, it's Eric Murphy.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.813
- Vincent Chase's manager.
- It's too late.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.526
My voice will be heard
around the world tomorrow morning.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.903
Well, Vince would like to apologize.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.537
- I don't see Vince.
- Yeah, he sent me.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.540
Well, that figures. Fucking coward.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.625
Hey, maybe that'll be my headline,

14:36.709 --> 14:39.419
- "Fucking Coward to Play Aquaman. "
- You don't think

14:39.504 --> 14:41.880
- Vince would make a good Aquaman?
- I did this morning.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.216
You don't feel like
you have a responsibility to tell the truth?

14:44.300 --> 14:47.010
Eric, I started this site
out of my parents' basement

14:47.095 --> 14:49.888
for two reasons, to get laid
and make a little money.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.140
Neither of which are coming to fruition.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.601
No, my report goes out on the web

14:54.686 --> 14:57.187
tomorrow morning,
and it's followed by another one

14:57.272 --> 14:59.815
every week until the movie opens.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.276
I have one goal in my life right now,

15:02.485 --> 15:04.945
drown Aquaman.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.163
I'm not apologizing.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.749
I'm telling you,
this guy's looking for a little love.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.503
- It'll turn this whole thing around.
- So give him a little love.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.088
I've got nothing,

15:23.172 --> 15:25.340
except Shiry Robbins can be here at 10:00.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.093
Who's she?
- Maxim girl. Great ass!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.763
- 10:00 P.M.
- Vincent, we're in San Diego, okay?

15:31.848 --> 15:34.099
Finding you a girl with a Q rating
isn't that easy.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.684
What is this?

15:36.185 --> 15:39.479
Vince has got me working the phones
trying to find him a dinner date.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.816
- I don't wanna go alone.
- Vincent, not for nothing,

15:42.900 --> 15:45.944
but what I should be doing is
dealing with this Spencer situation

15:46.029 --> 15:47.529
before the studio does.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.948
I got an idea.
I can call one of my Cartier contacts

15:50.033 --> 15:51.867
and see if I can get him a watch or something.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.411
- Why, can you buy this guy?
- Well, rumor has it

15:54.495 --> 15:56.455
they flew him out to L.A., first class,

15:56.539 --> 15:58.582
put him up for a week
at the Scientology Center,

15:58.666 --> 16:00.667
and he gave Swordfish four stars.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.171
Yo, I've been searching all over this place
for a dinner date for you.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.299
The concierge is kind of hot,
but she's wearing Spock ears.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.801
No, I can't go with a Trekkie.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.347
- Why can't you go to the dinner alone?
- Because I'm uncomfortable.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.724
Because I haven't had
a real relationship since Mandy.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.978
And I don't want to get into it
while she's holding hands with her fiancÃ©.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.106
- Melting down.
- Yo, you guys, what do you think?

16:23.191 --> 16:26.443
- Home or away?
- Oh, my God!

16:26.944 --> 16:29.655
- Jesus, look at your face.
- What are you talking about?

16:29.739 --> 16:32.532
- It's perfectly even.
- Johnny, you're burnt to a crisp.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.578
Naw, in another hour
that'll turn to a nice maple-syrupy brown.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.830
Another hour and
your fucking nose is gonna fall off.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.751
- Get dressed.
- Why?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.294
I told you I don't wanna go alone.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.254
You want me to go as your date?

16:46.339 --> 16:50.342
All right, on second thought, I'll go alone.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.053
You just figure out
what to do about this Spencer guy.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.020
Yo!

17:02.105 --> 17:03.355
- What's up, Drama?
- How's it hanging?

17:03.439 --> 17:05.607
- All right. Victory!
- Victory!

17:23.960 --> 17:25.544
Yo, Bobby!

17:27.003 --> 17:29.381
What's up, chief? Another year, baby.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.133
Hey, Johnny.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.219
How great is this?
Our booths are never this close.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.930
Now we can talk.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.142
I'm gonna go look for Spencer.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.520
I'm gonna go with you.
Your fans, they spook me.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.247
Ah, Mr. Chase, welcome to the restaurant.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.207
- I'm Craig, your host.
- Hello, Craig. I'm here to meet with...

18:04.292 --> 18:06.376
Of course. Ms. Mandy and Mr. Chris, right?

18:06.461 --> 18:07.753
- Yes.
- They are waiting for you.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.254
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.690
Thanks for coming, buddy.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.525
Next!

18:32.028 --> 18:34.029
Where was Tarvold born?

18:34.739 --> 18:36.031
How was the concert?

18:36.407 --> 18:37.908
Amazing.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.702
Yeah, I hear it wasn't their best.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.204
I've been to every tour.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.539
They all kick ass, equally.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.333
Great.

18:46.417 --> 18:50.128
- Now where was Tarvold born?
- That's easy, Orkney.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.923
No, it's Northumbria.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.718
Fucking Turtle.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.933
I was originally from the galaxy of Salvan,

19:03.017 --> 19:05.227
but that was before my rebirth.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.358
How could you not know
where you were born?

19:16.531 --> 19:18.657
Angel, excuse me...

19:18.741 --> 19:20.826
I'd like to have a word with you, please.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.995
- Could it wait like half an hour?
- No, it can't.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.540
Okay, Johnny. I'll be back in five minutes.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.961
I told you to put on block.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.546
Forget about my tan.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.173
What you're doing here is disgusting.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.050
- What?
- You're selling sex.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.761
- I mean, look at this outfit.
- Why do you hate me?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.680
I don't hate you.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.850
You always have.
Ever since that first day on Viking Quest,

19:44.934 --> 19:47.185
- you've been so mean to me.
- No, I...

19:47.270 --> 19:49.437
And I had the biggest crush on you.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.899
- You did?
- Yes!

19:53.359 --> 19:55.485
Oh, my God. I had the biggest crush on you.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.195
That's why I was mean to you.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.614
I was rejecting you
before you could reject me.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.075
I wish you would've told me back then.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.996
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- But...

20:19.135 --> 20:20.427
Victory!

20:20.511 --> 20:22.470
Victory!

20:27.018 --> 20:30.312
So you started with the comic book,
then the porn?

20:30.396 --> 20:33.273
No, I did porn, then I decided
to go on with the comic book.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.400
Oh, smart move, very smart.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.236
So tell me more about Pussy Patrol.

20:38.321 --> 20:42.407
Well, we're a gang-banging gang
of working girls who kick criminal ass.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.868
Speaking of kicking their ass,

20:44.952 --> 20:46.828
what do you do with the naughty boys?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.581
You know, naughty boys
that do naughty things?

20:50.875 --> 20:51.958
What up, Jesse?

20:52.043 --> 20:54.753
Hey, it's Vince's guys. You know R.J.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.713
Yeah, we know each other.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.549
If you don't mind when you're finished
if I can get a minute.

20:59.634 --> 21:03.428
- Your minute starts right now.
- All right, I really want to fix this.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.264
I was thinking, we go into production,
you should come out.

21:06.349 --> 21:09.059
All expenses paid, watch Cameron work,
hang out on the set.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.687
You want a PlayStation portable,
I got the hook up.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.356
I can get you two dozen of them.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.443
I want $350,000 in a duffel bag.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.113
- You're kidding me, right?
- No, I'm not kidding.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.240
And until that gets delivered,
the article stands.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.160
And you know why?
'Cause I don't like your friend.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.995
You're really starting to piss me off.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.122
Oh, wow.

21:31.207 --> 21:34.501
What are you gonna do? I had Oliver Stone
come after me with a hatchet

21:34.585 --> 21:37.045
after I smashed Alexander, okay?

21:37.129 --> 21:39.130
- You don't scare me.
- Yeah? Do I scare you?

21:39.215 --> 21:40.924
'Cause I'll slap you in your fucking head.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.176
Come on, let me hit him once.
I won't break nothing.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.762
Let it go, Turtle.
- What the fuck is his problem?

21:45.846 --> 21:48.139
He hates Vince.
He's gonna trash him on his web site

21:48.224 --> 21:49.683
and say he's gonna make a shitty Aquaman.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.310
Why?
Vince would make an adorable Aquaman.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.728
Yeah, you should tell him that.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.314
Yeah, sweetie, you should.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.566
Aquaman's in trouble.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.403
The fate of Atlantis
and all of mankind lies in your hands.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.780
It's time to unleash the power of the pussy.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.407
Don't bullshit me, tough guy.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.867
If I do it, I'll do it because I like Vince.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.494
Yo!

22:09.578 --> 22:12.789
I just made $3,800, bro.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.666
Are you gonna see her again?

22:14.750 --> 22:18.211
Are you kidding?
We're flying together at Comic-Con Phoenix.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.796
What happened at dinner?

22:22.008 --> 22:24.175
- I blew it off.
- Good job, Vince.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.136
Freeze her out, like I told you to do.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.014
Aw, Vince, you should've gone
and ordered her food for her.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.558
That would've put a wedge
in between her and her fiancÃ©.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.226
What do you mean you blew it off?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.854
We just have to work together.
No need to blur the lines.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.898
More importantly, what happened
with Spencer. Did you take care of that?

22:38.983 --> 22:42.152
- Did you give him love?
- It's not my love he's interested in.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.203
Who is it?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.289
Pussy Patrol. Open up!

22:57.543 --> 22:59.461
Hey, Jesse, I...

22:59.545 --> 23:02.547
I thought we were gonna to finish
the interview down in the Oak Bar.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.923
We're done talking.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.469
- We're here to save Aquaman.
- And we brought this.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.934
Come in.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.583
That's wonderful.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.835
Okay, great!

23:40.920 --> 23:43.421
That was R.J., Eric. What did you do to him?

23:43.506 --> 23:45.590
- Why, what did he say?
- He said, and I quote,

23:45.674 --> 23:47.842
"Vince is going to make
the best fucking Aquaman ever!"

23:47.927 --> 23:50.762
That was the quickest 180
I've ever seen in my life.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.806
Let's just say we have mutual friends.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.141
The power of the pussy, baby.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.811
You kiss your grandmother
with those fucking lips?

23:57.895 --> 24:00.897
- I thought you said 10:30.
- Vince, come on!

24:00.981 --> 24:02.857
I know you well enough
to know when you're lying.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.901
There was no reason not to show up.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.570
All right, let's just say hypothetically
I am lying,

24:07.655 --> 24:11.324
which I'm not, but if I was,
you need me to be friends

24:11.408 --> 24:13.076
with your fiancÃ©,
and I need not to be friends with him.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.119
- Why?
- Because.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.037
We're not playing games anymore.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.206
Is this going to be a problem
for us to work together?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.458
No. I'm just gonna do my work every day.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.210
- Fine, so am I.
- Fine. Good.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.295
Live from the Hollywood Room
at Comic-Con...

24:24.380 --> 24:25.380
- Okay.
- Good.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.966
...here are the stars
ofthe upcoming Aquaman,

24:28.050 --> 24:31.094
Vincent Chase and Mandy Moore!

24:44.066 --> 24:46.276
I hope there's a part in this movie for me.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.570
Oh, yeah. You're gonna play Aqua Velva.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.162
Hey, say something!

24:57.246 --> 24:59.664
We look forward to fighting injustice,

24:59.748 --> 25:02.792
righting that which is wrong
and serving all of mankind.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.170
Above and below sea level!

25:07.256 --> 25:08.840
Give them a big hand,
ladies and gentlemen.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.259
- He's good.
- No, he's great.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.645
Hey, what's up, Ari?

25:22.730 --> 25:25.190
Just read R.J. Spencer online.
Good work, Eric.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.609
- Put Drama on the phone.
- Hold on.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.446
- It's Ari.
- Ari?

25:31.780 --> 25:33.364
- For me?
- Yeah.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.700
- Fuck that.
- Take it!

25:37.745 --> 25:40.622
Yeah, what do you want, birthday-ruiner?

25:40.706 --> 25:43.875
It's 4:00. You've got four hours
to get back from San Diego.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.543
- For what?
- U2, baby!

25:45.628 --> 25:47.462
You didn't hear?
They just added an extra show.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.466
- You got tickets?
- Oh, I got tickets. Happy belated.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.218
How are the seats?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.345
Nosebleeds. Just like you like them.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.472
Yes!

28:36.298 --> 28:37.924
All right, now.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.804
Hey, Johnny Drama!
