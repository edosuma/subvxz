[theme music playing]

01:13.041 --> 01:15.333
[gentle music playing]

01:16.000 --> 01:17.875
[woman]
<i>We lay my love and I…</i>

01:17.958 --> 01:20.125
[insects chirping]

01:21.541 --> 01:23.166
<i>…beneath the weeping willow.</i>

01:26.125 --> 01:27.916
[water gurgling]

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
[gasps]

01:30.333 --> 01:32.208
[woman] <i>But now alone I lie…</i>

01:35.916 --> 01:37.625
…<i>and weep beside the tree.</i>

01:41.208 --> 01:43.500
<i>Singin', "O willow waly…"</i>

01:48.875 --> 01:50.750
…<i>by the tree that weeps with me.</i>

01:54.416 --> 01:57.291
<i>Singing, "O willow waly…"</i>

02:02.833 --> 02:04.791
…<i>till my lover return to me.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:06.875

02:22.166 --> 02:24.166
[dinging]

02:24.458 --> 02:26.833
[man] <i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

02:27.333 --> 02:30.458
You'll get to your meals momentarily,
but first…

02:31.375 --> 02:33.583
the bride has asked me to speak.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.000
I thought she was joking!

02:35.083 --> 02:37.750
Why invite such catastrophe

02:37.833 --> 02:39.250
upon your own wedding?

02:39.333 --> 02:41.916
-[guests chuckling]
-[man] But, as she explained,

02:42.125 --> 02:44.125
"No, heavens, no. Not the wedding,

02:44.208 --> 02:45.583
the practice meal."

02:45.666 --> 02:48.250
The rehearsal dinner, for God's sakes!

02:48.333 --> 02:52.541
I must claim my right as a slightly drunk,
completely jet-lagged Englishman

02:52.625 --> 02:54.916
to well and truly speak my mind.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.791
Because I want to warn you all,

02:56.875 --> 02:59.666
you young people
have absolutely no idea

02:59.750 --> 03:02.166
what you are letting yourselves in for.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.041
Oh…

03:08.458 --> 03:09.958
Here's a horrifying statistic.

03:10.041 --> 03:12.750
Did you know
that almost half of marriages these days

03:12.833 --> 03:15.000
do not end up in divorce?

03:15.416 --> 03:16.750
[guests chuckling]

03:16.833 --> 03:21.750
That means there's a strong probability
that you two get to watch each other die.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.458
And that's the preferred outcome.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.166
To truly love another person

03:27.625 --> 03:30.958
is to accept that the work of loving them

03:31.583 --> 03:33.791
is worth the pain of losing them.

03:34.750 --> 03:35.583
And that's it.

03:36.791 --> 03:37.625
That's all.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.958
And if that scares you
as much as it scares me,

03:41.041 --> 03:42.166
then I say run.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.708
Go off and do drugs on a beach in Bali.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.833
Devote yourself to a life
of the mind. Run!

03:46.916 --> 03:50.625
Run while you still can. You're young,
you're strong. The world… [fades out]

03:50.708 --> 03:51.791
[bride] No, I'm serious,

03:51.875 --> 03:54.416
-we actually refused to stay here.
-<i>She </i>refused.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.958
[female guest 1] I didn't know
staying here was even an option.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.666
[bride] There's three suites
in the castle,

03:58.750 --> 04:00.875
-and Jack wanted to stay here…
-[Jack] Just one night.

04:00.958 --> 04:02.375
…before we left for the honeymoon.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.625
Just tomorrow. Just after the reception,
so we could just stumble upstairs.

04:06.041 --> 04:08.291
[bride] But I said,
"No way, not after those stories."

04:08.375 --> 04:10.458
[female guest 1] Wait, just the stories?

04:10.541 --> 04:13.375
-You didn't <i>see </i>her?
-No! God no, I didn't see her.

04:13.458 --> 04:16.750
If I saw a dead woman, a dead nun,
no less, crying in the corners,

04:17.208 --> 04:19.833
-we would not be getting married here.
-Okay, it's just a story.

04:19.916 --> 04:23.541
This place used to be a convent for, like,
a few decades in the '40s.

04:23.625 --> 04:24.833
It's part of the sales package.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.583
They can charge a few hundred extra
for the ghost story.

04:27.833 --> 04:31.791
Look, I love a good ghost story,
I just don't want to sleep in one.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.583
[female guest 2]
We honeymooned in Ireland.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.208
They kept telling us
to look out for Seamus,

04:36.291 --> 04:37.166
the stable boy.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.000
-Oh, Seamus.
-[guests chuckling]

04:39.083 --> 04:42.375
[female guest 2] They said his head was
crushed in where a horse had kicked him.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.625
[bride] Ghost stories are worse
when there's a kid.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.375
[female guest 2] Adds a little something,
doesn't it? [chuckles]

04:47.500 --> 04:48.541
I have a story.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.041
Well…

04:53.250 --> 04:54.666
…it isn't really my story.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.708
It belongs to someone I knew.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.666
And it's not exactly short.

05:00.458 --> 05:03.000
Well, it seems we have time enough, and…

05:03.083 --> 05:03.958
wine enough.

05:05.875 --> 05:06.708
Why not?

05:17.000 --> 05:17.833
All right, then.

05:18.875 --> 05:19.708
A ghost story.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.458
Again, this story isn't mine,

05:25.291 --> 05:28.625
but it is full of ghosts of all sorts.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.375
And if a child gives the effect,

05:33.041 --> 05:34.958
another turn of the screw…

05:37.750 --> 05:38.958
…what do you say to two?

05:48.208 --> 05:51.458
<i>The teacher was, by choice,</i>
<i>a solitary young woman.</i>

05:51.958 --> 05:55.916
<i>Come up to London in trepidation</i>
<i>to answer in person an advertisement…</i>

05:57.208 --> 05:59.166
…<i>placed by one Lord Henry Wingrave</i>

05:59.958 --> 06:01.791
<i>regarding his young nephew and niece,</i>

06:02.208 --> 06:03.833
<i>who were in need of an au pair.</i>

06:04.125 --> 06:06.500
<i>A full-time position, it said.</i>
<i>Live-in, at that,</i>

06:07.208 --> 06:09.208
<i>in his old family home in Essex.</i>

06:09.708 --> 06:10.916
<i>A great good place,</i>

06:11.333 --> 06:12.458
<i>alone in the country.</i>

06:13.166 --> 06:15.000
[cars honking]

06:30.708 --> 06:31.875
Miss Clayton, is it?

06:31.958 --> 06:34.041
Oh, call me Dani. Hi there.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.458
Please, have a seat.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.958
-You're a teacher?
-Yes.

06:41.875 --> 06:42.750
Or I was.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.333
Fourth grade.

06:44.833 --> 06:45.875
In the States.

06:46.416 --> 06:47.291
Mm-hmm.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.375
Been in England long?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.958
[sighs] About six months.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.541
Six months? During which time, you've…

06:56.666 --> 06:57.833
Well, I've…

06:57.916 --> 07:00.000
[in British accent]
…fallen quite in love with London.

07:01.041 --> 07:01.875
God.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.375
Tea? Coffee?

07:06.375 --> 07:09.541
[without accent] No, thank you.
Haven't quite mastered tea yet.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.791
I'm used to it coming in a pitcher.

07:12.208 --> 07:13.208
Full of ice cubes…

07:14.541 --> 07:15.875
…and lemon wedges, and…

07:16.541 --> 07:18.541
Well, it's a whole different thing here.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.833
[Henry] Yes, it is.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.625
You've no previous experience
as an au pair.

07:28.708 --> 07:29.541
Well, I…

07:30.250 --> 07:33.166
I've quite a bit of experience
with children, Mr. Wingrave.

07:33.250 --> 07:37.208
In a classroom,
but this is a full-time, live-in position.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.708
I know, that's actually why

07:38.791 --> 07:41.125
-I responded to the ad.
-The children are wonderful.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.541
Exceptional, really,
my niece and my nephew.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.916
Exceptional children, as I said.

07:46.791 --> 07:49.458
But challenging, both.

07:49.541 --> 07:53.708
Miles, my nephew, is back home
from boarding school early.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.583
He needs structure,

07:55.666 --> 07:57.500
discipline more than ever, I fear.

07:58.791 --> 07:59.625
Mm-hmm.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.541
Well, can I ask why he was sent home?

08:01.875 --> 08:04.375
-Spring session shouldn't end--
-You'd be expected to tutor him

08:04.458 --> 08:05.916
so he doesn't fall behind.

08:06.125 --> 08:10.333
In that respect, your classroom experience
may actually be of use.

08:10.916 --> 08:12.458
The same with Flora,

08:12.541 --> 08:13.583
my niece.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.583
You'd tutor her as well.

08:15.916 --> 08:19.458
Your ad mentioned the position
was in the countryside?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.000
In Bly,

08:21.791 --> 08:23.416
my family's country house.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.875
The children are used to Bly, they…

08:27.541 --> 08:30.833
spent summers and holidays there
with their parents,

08:31.583 --> 08:32.666
before they passed.

08:33.458 --> 08:35.291
It's a great good place, the manor.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.750
There are few others on the grounds.

08:37.833 --> 08:41.000
A cook, groundskeeper.
They stay in town.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.375
There is a live-in housekeeper,
but the children…

08:44.750 --> 08:47.958
would be your responsibility
and yours alone.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.750
Don't call on me
unless it's an emergency.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.375
I'm extraordinarily busy.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.291
I understand.

08:56.541 --> 08:57.375
You know,

08:57.541 --> 09:00.625
one of my more unique assignments
at my school

09:00.875 --> 09:03.333
was specific
to some of our highest-need children,

09:03.416 --> 09:06.708
-one of whom had actually lost their par--
-What's the catch?

09:08.708 --> 09:09.625
I'm sorry?

09:10.208 --> 09:11.833
The catch. You're what?

09:13.208 --> 09:14.083
Thirty?

09:14.166 --> 09:15.333
Mid-twenties?

09:16.333 --> 09:17.208
I wonder…

09:17.916 --> 09:19.125
What's the catch?

09:19.458 --> 09:22.041
You're younger than most
who'd apply for this sort of thing.

09:22.125 --> 09:25.125
What makes a woman of your age

09:25.208 --> 09:28.958
want to give up her life
to take care of someone else's children?

09:29.416 --> 09:31.125
A life in America, at that.

09:31.583 --> 09:32.791
Full-time as well.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.958
It seems odd… to me, to be frank.

09:38.125 --> 09:38.958
Hm.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.250
It seems odd to me too.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.750
The listing, I mean.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.625
A full-time position
in a beautiful country manor

09:49.708 --> 09:51.250
to two exceptional children.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.750
But I saw your ad six months ago.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.208
When I first arrived in London.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.666
And I have seen it every month since.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.000
Seems to me an easy position to fill.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.666
At least as you've described.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.458
So, I suppose you're right.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.458
What <i>is</i> the catch?

10:14.583 --> 10:16.041
That really is the question.

10:17.708 --> 10:20.750
[rock music playing in background]

10:22.208 --> 10:23.041
Thank you.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.291
[cars honking in distance]

10:35.750 --> 10:37.166
[Henry sighs]

10:41.458 --> 10:42.458
Alright, James?

10:42.708 --> 10:43.541
[clears throat]

10:52.333 --> 10:53.750
I know I didn't get the job,

10:54.500 --> 10:55.791
and that's totally cool.

10:56.708 --> 10:59.250
But that was the most awkward
job interview of my entire life.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.833
So, I think we should toast to it,
Mr. Wingrave.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.416
Or do you prefer it in your tea?

11:11.416 --> 11:12.333
[Dani] So…

11:12.791 --> 11:14.500
you can tell me now, right?

11:15.416 --> 11:17.208
I'm honestly so, so curious.

11:17.958 --> 11:18.916
About what?

11:21.041 --> 11:21.875
The catch.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.458
-[chuckling] Oh, no.
-No, come on!

11:25.791 --> 11:26.625
Well…

11:28.625 --> 11:31.166
…imagination, I suppose.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.791
No one wants the job.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.375
Oh, come on. No one?

11:36.625 --> 11:39.166
We did find someone for a while.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.333
Last summer.

11:41.041 --> 11:42.916
A promising young woman.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.375
The children liked her.

11:44.458 --> 11:45.291
Mm-hmm.

11:45.958 --> 11:47.375
And then, she… [sighs]

11:48.041 --> 11:50.458
Well, I-I suppose she died.

11:50.958 --> 11:53.583
It was her own fault, to be blunt.

11:53.708 --> 11:55.541
Her choice, to be blunter,

11:55.958 --> 11:57.958
but she died on the grounds.

11:58.625 --> 12:02.583
People are superstitious,
especially in the country.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.250
So, now it's a story.

12:06.125 --> 12:10.875
These small children in that huge house
with their dead parents,

12:10.958 --> 12:13.416
and now, their dead governess.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.750
[sighs]
Never mind the parents died abroad.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.500
Never mind the governess took her own…

12:20.083 --> 12:23.916
So, yes, the story precedes the job,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.791
-at least at all the agencies.
-[Dani sighs]

12:25.875 --> 12:28.083
Now, no one wants it.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.250
Superstition…

12:29.916 --> 12:31.125
imagination.

12:35.708 --> 12:36.708
What about you?

12:37.208 --> 12:38.625
What was your catch?

12:39.958 --> 12:40.791
I, um…

12:42.916 --> 12:44.250
…couldn't be at home anymore.

12:46.750 --> 12:51.083
Have you ever taught a classroom
of 25 kids?

12:51.208 --> 12:54.458
-No, I absolutely have not, I'm afraid.
-[Dani chuckles]

12:55.041 --> 12:55.875
Well…

12:56.375 --> 12:57.458
you take to them.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.125
You love them.

13:00.416 --> 13:02.375
Even the worst ones. [laughs]

13:03.083 --> 13:04.000
You just do.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.083
And you try to help…

13:09.166 --> 13:11.375
…but there's just too many of them.
[chuckles]

13:12.208 --> 13:13.458
And too little of you.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.000
So, you just…

13:18.250 --> 13:21.250
The ad said two children.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.666
I figure I don't know the specifics,
but I know how to handle kids.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.625
Maybe I can make a difference.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.083
I could. I could make a difference.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.833
A real difference.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.916
With just two. [chuckles]

13:39.500 --> 13:41.708
Then I noticed the position was…

13:42.583 --> 13:44.583
full-time, live-in.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.625
And then it clicked.
They've lost someone.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.083
Now, I understand death.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.541
I know what loss is.

<i>I got a job.</i>

14:24.958 --> 14:29.166
Yeah, I-I got a trial position,
at least to the end of the summer.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.750
But it could go on for quite--

14:32.083 --> 14:35.458
No, I know. I know it's longer
than I said, but I got a job.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.041
<i>-I'm not.</i>

14:40.083 --> 14:42.375
I'm not running from anything,

14:42.833 --> 14:44.541
and it hurts me when you say that.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.833
You know it hurts me when you say that.

14:51.583 --> 14:52.416

-Yeah.

15:34.916 --> 15:35.875
-Owen.
-Hi.

15:35.958 --> 15:37.916
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.041
-Let me get-- Let's get that.
-[Dani] Yeah. I have some bags.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.333
No worries. Thank you.

15:42.833 --> 15:43.666
Thank you.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.666
Oh, uh, sorry about that.
Country roads.

15:59.916 --> 16:01.041
How long was I out?

16:01.291 --> 16:02.125
Oh, a while.

16:03.541 --> 16:05.250
Are you still on American time?

16:05.500 --> 16:06.333
Oh, no.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.750
I just haven't got much sleep lately.

16:10.541 --> 16:11.375
Ah.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.375
Well, hostels aren't terribly restful.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.208
I mean,
you'll find it much quieter out here.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.791
-[Dani] It's gorgeous.
-Is it?

16:20.583 --> 16:21.416
What?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.250
I can't tell anymore, personally.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.666
Uh, I was born in Bly.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.166
The town, I mean, not the manor.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.500
I escaped for a bit.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.208
Spent some time in France.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.291
-What?
-Studying to be a chef.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.750
Yet, here I was,
just thinking you were a driver.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.458
No, no, no, only sometimes,
when Henry asks me.

16:37.625 --> 16:41.916
-[Dani chuckles]
-Frankly, I'm a rubbish driver. [chuckles]

16:42.166 --> 16:43.458
But not a bad cook, turns out.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.250
Why'd you come back?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.250
-From France?
-Family.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.333
And this job pays the bills,
while I'm here.

16:50.416 --> 16:51.916
-[Dani] Mm-hmm.
-And it keeps me close.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.666
Well, there are worse places to be stuck,
believe me.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.333
I've actually never liked Bly.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.833
The people here, most of them,

16:58.958 --> 17:00.666
they're born here, they die here.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.750
The whole town
is one big gravity well.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.041
And it's easy to get stuck.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.125
[Dani sighs]

17:09.000 --> 17:10.375
God, is that…

17:12.208 --> 17:14.458
[Owen] Like I said, plenty to love.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.791

but you mustn't run on them.

and the stairs are not forgiving.

-And what do you think of it so far?

23:30.125 --> 23:33.708
-Um, Bly? Or the world?
-I want to go to Australia.

23:33.791 --> 23:36.833
Or Florida, because it's almost my name.

-That's right.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.125
-It's just so gorgeous here.
-Yeah.

23:42.250 --> 23:45.875
I know I keep saying that,
but there's no other word.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.291
-I could think of a few others.
-Oh, hush now, Owen.

23:48.375 --> 23:51.250
-He likes to wind me up.
-She likes being wound up.

23:51.791 --> 23:53.250
Aren't you joining us?

Um, not tonight, sweetheart.

Is she feeling better?

24:03.375 --> 24:04.208

24:04.875 --> 24:06.125
Better every day, I reckon.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.458
All right. [sighs]

24:08.666 --> 24:10.875
Good night, you lovely young lady.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.083
And good night to you, too, Flora.

24:13.166 --> 24:15.041
[Hannah] Ugh, heaven help me, this man.

24:15.125 --> 24:15.958
Enjoy.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.208
So, he lives with his mother?

24:20.291 --> 24:22.041
[sighs] Lives <i>for </i>her, more like.

24:22.541 --> 24:24.291
That's why he came back from Paris.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.708
-[Dani] Mm.
-She took ill. Quite ill, I've heard.

24:26.958 --> 24:28.083
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.625
He said she's getting better.

24:29.708 --> 24:30.875
Yeah, better every day.

24:30.958 --> 24:33.500
He says that, but he leaves earlier
and earlier these days.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.375
He used to stay every night for supper.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.458
Maybe she feels well enough to eat,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.250
so he has to get home in time
to cook for her.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.333
I'm sure you're right, sweetheart.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.416
What? You're not gonna eat?

24:44.666 --> 24:46.250
Oh… Oh, well, yeah.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.041
-I'll have it later.
-[Dani] Okay.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.166

I'll give you some pointers.

Well, you're sure getting there.

[Flora giggles]

25:13.000 --> 25:13.833
What?

25:13.916 --> 25:15.958
It really is very silly, isn't it?

25:16.125 --> 25:17.333
[Dani chuckles]

25:19.250 --> 25:21.958
Yes, you're a very silly girl.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.708
Where did you get that?

25:26.166 --> 25:28.166
-What?
-The butterfly clip.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.083
Oh…

25:29.500 --> 25:30.333
Um…

25:30.625 --> 25:31.750
Miles gave it to me.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.833
He shouldn't have done that.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.000
Why not?

25:36.958 --> 25:38.791
Because it doesn't belong to you.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.416
Who does it belong to?

25:45.833 --> 25:48.041
-Miss Jessel.
-Who's that?

25:48.875 --> 25:49.791
The other one.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.958
-Before you.
-I'm…

25:52.833 --> 25:53.916
I'm so sorry.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.833
I…

25:55.166 --> 25:56.291
I'm so sorry.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.041
I was wrong. It's actually fine.

26:08.708 --> 26:09.833
Can I get out now?

26:10.791 --> 26:12.125
Can I play with my dolls?

26:12.208 --> 26:13.666
Yeah. Fifteen minutes, okay?

You know, I've gone
to every kind of school you can think of.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.000
Have you?

26:42.583 --> 26:44.541
Even a boarding school once, like you.

26:45.041 --> 26:46.375
I know how hard it can be.

26:48.291 --> 26:49.375
It's not so bad.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.041
Well…

26:52.166 --> 26:53.916
…you're home now, aren't you?

26:57.666 --> 27:00.166
Look, you can talk to me
about whatever you'd like.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.083
About school.

27:03.708 --> 27:05.166
Anything that happened there.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.750
I promise, I've heard it all.

27:10.416 --> 27:11.583
It's very kind of you.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.000
Good night, Dani.

27:17.083 --> 27:17.916
Good night.

27:22.958 --> 27:26.166
You know, Mrs. Grose seems to think
you should call me Miss Clayton.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.083
Didn't you like it?

27:31.125 --> 27:31.958
I'm sorry?

27:32.666 --> 27:33.666

Oh, I… [clicks tongue]

27:37.041 --> 27:37.916
You know, Flora…

27:38.625 --> 27:40.208
was a little upset, I think.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.166
She's always a little upset.

27:43.041 --> 27:44.666
Whether she admits it or not.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.291
But she's so, so glad you're here.

27:48.041 --> 27:48.875
And so am I.

27:49.625 --> 27:51.875
Well, thank you for making me feel
so welcome.

28:04.166 --> 28:05.000
[Dani] Bedtime!

28:05.500 --> 28:07.250
-And I'm finished.
-[Dani] Mm-hmm.

28:07.458 --> 28:08.958
Perfect timing.

28:11.875 --> 28:12.791
Is that me?

28:13.041 --> 28:15.083
Why, no, silly. You're you.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.000
It's just a dolly.

[gentle piano music plays]

28:21.791 --> 28:23.208
[Dani] Who are all these?

28:23.375 --> 28:25.750
[Flora] Why, they're dolls, of course.

28:25.833 --> 28:26.791
[Dani chuckles]

28:27.500 --> 28:30.791
You, miss, have a lot of dolls,

28:31.750 --> 28:33.458
and we're going to learn

28:33.833 --> 28:36.125
how to pick them all up
before we go to sleep, okay?

28:44.083 --> 28:45.208
[Flora] Put her back.

28:47.041 --> 28:48.458
She stays…

28:49.041 --> 28:49.875
there.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.000
And you're all tucked in.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.000
And it's time for bed.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.583
It's just lovely that you're here.

29:12.708 --> 29:13.791
Thank you, Flora.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.958
But you have to promise me something.

29:17.291 --> 29:18.416
Of course.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.375
You have to promise me

29:21.041 --> 29:22.541
that you'll stay in your room.

29:23.375 --> 29:25.083
Don't leave your room at night.

29:25.541 --> 29:27.208
Stay in your bed until morning.

29:28.958 --> 29:30.625
I don't think I can promise that.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.208
But it's certainly a good rule
for you and your brother--

29:34.291 --> 29:35.583
But you must.

29:38.708 --> 29:39.541
Okay.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.666
At least for tonight.

29:43.041 --> 29:44.250

and you know what I learned?

Of course.
I knew that about you right away.

39:47.458 --> 39:49.291
[quiet, unsettling music plays]

40:46.708 --> 40:47.541
[Dani gasps]

40:49.250 --> 40:50.291
Oh…

40:50.375 --> 40:51.916
Did you-- Did you find anyone?

40:54.416 --> 40:55.666
-No.
-[Hannah] Oh.

40:55.958 --> 40:56.791
I didn't.

40:57.208 --> 40:58.041
But…

40:58.250 --> 40:59.291
I did find some…

41:00.416 --> 41:02.833
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting you?
[chuckles awkwardly]

41:02.916 --> 41:04.083
Oh, no. No, not at all.

41:04.166 --> 41:05.083
What did you find?

41:07.166 --> 41:08.000
Ah.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.000
It's Flora.

41:11.791 --> 41:14.500
-Ah, Flora, Flora…
-I've seen a few of these.

41:15.250 --> 41:16.791
Well, you can't judge them.

41:17.791 --> 41:19.625
Not after what they've been through.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.916
Mr. Wingrave told you about their parents,
I'm sure.

41:23.458 --> 41:24.833
-Only that they passed.
-Mm.

41:26.416 --> 41:27.500
Two years ago, now.

41:29.208 --> 41:31.083
Miles was only eight. Flora, six.

41:31.416 --> 41:32.250
[Dani] Mm.

41:32.375 --> 41:34.583
And that's enough bad luck
for two children to bear,

41:34.666 --> 41:35.708
but then to think…

41:36.500 --> 41:37.666
what came after.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.791
Your-- your predecessor.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.500
-Miss Jessel?
-Yeah.

41:44.416 --> 41:45.250
Rebecca.

41:47.583 --> 41:48.416
God…

41:48.833 --> 41:50.583
Rebecca. Poor Rebecca.

41:51.916 --> 41:52.750
She was…

41:53.750 --> 41:55.416
She was a bright young thing.

41:56.958 --> 41:58.958
She was ambitious, intelligent.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.125
Kind of heart.

42:03.000 --> 42:03.833
But…

42:07.375 --> 42:08.500
…there was a man.

42:08.583 --> 42:11.666
Which really is the only thing
that can bring down a woman like that.

42:12.083 --> 42:14.791
All the world's vices
in disguise of its graces.

42:15.625 --> 42:17.666
Anyway, the less said about him,
the better.

42:19.250 --> 42:20.500
You know he skipped town?

42:21.041 --> 42:24.000
With a tidy sum of Henry's money
and the poor thing's heart.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.791
Stole a lot, that one. Sticky fingers.

42:28.791 --> 42:31.125
And to see her
in the days leading up to it.

42:33.541 --> 42:35.250
So broken.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.125
So empty.

42:39.875 --> 42:42.916
She was gone long before
she waded into that lake.

42:44.791 --> 42:45.625
Oh…

42:46.333 --> 42:47.333
Flora found her.

42:48.125 --> 42:50.208
And Jamie found Flora.

42:52.166 --> 42:53.291
To hear her tell it…

42:53.791 --> 42:55.583
Rebecca's body in that water.

42:56.750 --> 42:57.875
Face down.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.750
And little Flora just…

43:02.583 --> 43:04.166
…stone-still…

43:05.208 --> 43:06.166
…staring.

43:08.208 --> 43:09.041
And I…

43:09.500 --> 43:12.083
To think I used to cringe
when I heard the children…

43:12.625 --> 43:15.416
running through the house,
screaming and kicking up a fuss.

43:17.208 --> 43:19.375
But in the weeks
after Miss Jessel there…

43:21.041 --> 43:23.166
Silence, it never felt so terrible.

43:24.541 --> 43:25.416
And now…

43:27.166 --> 43:28.375
Now, when I hear them…

43:29.000 --> 43:30.333
cry, or… [sniffles]

43:30.875 --> 43:32.250
…scream, or yell…

43:34.125 --> 43:36.541
God, it's the most beautiful sound
in the world.

43:37.041 --> 43:38.500
-I'm so sorry.
-[Dani] No.

43:40.166 --> 43:42.208
-It's all right.
-Oh, God, look at me.

43:42.291 --> 43:43.291
[sighs]

43:48.625 --> 43:49.458
Oh…

43:55.041 --> 43:55.958
It's a talisman.

43:57.208 --> 44:00.000
A tiny game of Flora's
to keep us all safe.

44:02.083 --> 44:02.916
Us.

44:03.083 --> 44:04.791
God. My God, these children.

44:06.958 --> 44:09.666
Both of them
trying in their own way, I think.

44:11.333 --> 44:12.208
[Dani] Mm.

44:12.625 --> 44:15.041
[inhales deeply]
You know, I should head back.

44:15.375 --> 44:17.750
Owen and Jamie
will be leaving for the evening.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.791
But I'm happy to watch the children
before bed if you'd like a moment.

44:20.875 --> 44:22.875
Wh-What are the candles for?

44:25.291 --> 44:26.125
The dead.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.750
There's more of them than I'd like,
the older I get.

44:29.833 --> 44:30.666
I'm sorry.

44:30.750 --> 44:32.583
Oh, God, no need. [sniffs]

44:32.666 --> 44:35.916
I have been, and I remain,
a very happy woman.

44:36.541 --> 44:37.541
[Dani laughs gently]

44:40.125 --> 44:44.625
[somber orchestral music playing]

44:44.708 --> 44:46.708
[insects chittering]

44:52.291 --> 44:53.708
Good evening, Miss Clayton.

44:54.791 --> 44:55.708
Time for bed.

44:57.541 --> 44:58.375
Is it?

44:59.708 --> 45:00.708
I shouldn't think so.

45:01.458 --> 45:02.708
No more games, Miles.

45:04.166 --> 45:05.416
Do you like games, Dani?

45:07.083 --> 45:08.083
Not at bedtime.

45:09.416 --> 45:11.333
[Miles]
It's the best time for games, really.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.375
[Flora] Stop being weird, Miles!

45:14.166 --> 45:15.875
He's so weird sometimes.

45:16.750 --> 45:17.916
[Dani] And you…

45:18.750 --> 45:19.666
sweet thing.

45:32.458 --> 45:33.500
Imagination.

45:35.666 --> 45:37.375
I love…

45:38.250 --> 45:39.333
your imagination.

45:40.291 --> 45:42.583
And everyone in this house is so lucky…

45:43.583 --> 45:45.583
that you're using yours to keep us safe.

45:47.458 --> 45:48.416
Just promise me…

45:49.000 --> 45:50.875
that when you're keeping us all safe,

45:51.541 --> 45:53.458
that you keep yourself safe first.

45:54.333 --> 45:55.750
And no going on the parapet.

45:56.458 --> 45:57.291
Okay.

45:58.916 --> 46:00.416
You really are, you know?

46:01.500 --> 46:02.333
I'm what?

46:02.666 --> 46:04.166
Perfectly splendid.

46:04.250 --> 46:05.375
[Dani chuckles softly]

46:07.250 --> 46:08.458
Good night, sweet girl.

46:16.166 --> 46:17.041
Oh…

46:18.166 --> 46:19.833
I'm sorry!

46:20.125 --> 46:22.666
You know, you need to make sure
that you pick these up.

46:22.750 --> 46:23.791
I would hate to break…

46:29.791 --> 46:31.208
Where would you like her tonight?

46:32.875 --> 46:34.583
In the house or under the dresser?

46:34.916 --> 46:36.000
[Miles] Miss Clayton?

46:36.958 --> 46:38.833
[Dani sighs]
I was just about to tuck you in.

46:40.083 --> 46:42.416
There's an electric fan
in Flora's cupboard.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.416
I cannot sleep without it, I'm afraid.

46:44.916 --> 46:46.083
That-- that's right.

46:46.375 --> 46:47.291
My cupboard.

46:48.750 --> 46:50.958
Would you fetch it for me?
I'm awfully sorry.

46:52.541 --> 46:53.625
Oh…

46:53.708 --> 46:54.541
Sure thing.

46:58.000 --> 46:58.833
Well…

46:59.291 --> 47:00.333
here you go.

47:01.541 --> 47:03.125
She can sleep with you tonight.

47:07.875 --> 47:10.208
Okay, let's look.

47:12.375 --> 47:13.375
Hmm.

47:14.208 --> 47:16.958
-I don't see it!
-[Miles] It must be under some clothes.

47:21.000 --> 47:21.833
Okay.

47:30.041 --> 47:32.333
-[door slams]
-[lock clicks]

47:35.625 --> 47:36.458
Guys.

47:37.416 --> 47:38.500
I said no games.

47:38.833 --> 47:39.708
Open up!

47:42.541 --> 47:43.583
Open the door!

47:46.541 --> 47:47.375
Open it!

47:47.458 --> 47:49.333
-[lock rattling]
-[Miles] I'm trying!

47:50.166 --> 47:51.000
Miles!

47:52.125 --> 47:53.125
[Miles] I'm trying!

47:53.500 --> 47:54.375
Flora!

47:54.458 --> 47:56.583
[Flora] It's stuck. We're really trying!

47:58.000 --> 47:59.750
Okay, it's not-- it's not funny.

48:00.166 --> 48:01.083
Open the door.

48:01.166 --> 48:03.875
[Flora] We'll have to find the key.
It really is stuck.

48:03.958 --> 48:06.416
-We're very sorry!
-The key is in the lock, Flora.

48:06.666 --> 48:07.625
Turn the key.

48:07.750 --> 48:09.916
-[door rattling]
-[Miles] It's not! We can't find it!

48:14.166 --> 48:15.416
I'm being serious.

48:16.708 --> 48:17.916
Open the door!

48:18.041 --> 48:19.666
[door stops rattling]

48:19.750 --> 48:21.750
[ominous music playing]

48:23.500 --> 48:24.333
Miles!

48:27.083 --> 48:27.916
Flora?

48:29.458 --> 48:30.416
Open the door!

48:30.833 --> 48:33.166
[door rattling]

48:33.250 --> 48:34.500
[yelling] Open the door!

48:34.583 --> 48:37.333
-[pounding on door]
-[Dani yelling] Open the door!

48:38.250 --> 48:39.583
[screaming] Open the door!

48:39.666 --> 48:42.208
[panicked breathing]

48:42.291 --> 48:43.125
No!

48:43.833 --> 48:44.958
Open the door!

48:46.000 --> 48:46.833
Guys!

48:48.083 --> 48:49.291
[Dani screams]

48:50.000 --> 48:52.083
[panicked whimpering]

48:58.541 --> 48:59.708
[screaming] Let me out!

48:59.916 --> 49:00.875
Let me out!

49:02.041 --> 49:03.083
Let me out!

49:03.500 --> 49:04.500
[Dani crying]

49:04.583 --> 49:07.791
-Let me out! Let me out!
-[pounding on door]

49:08.333 --> 49:10.750
Let me out! Let me out!

49:11.708 --> 49:13.625

[door unlocking]

49:26.583 --> 49:28.000
-[Dani gasps]
-[Miles] I'm so sorry.

49:29.083 --> 49:30.500
We're dreadfully sorry.

49:30.583 --> 49:31.625
[breathing heavily]

49:34.875 --> 49:35.708
Bed!

49:35.791 --> 49:37.000
It was an accident.

49:39.000 --> 49:39.833
Bed!

49:40.125 --> 49:40.958
Now!

49:41.750 --> 49:42.583
I am sorry.

49:43.250 --> 49:46.375
-Please, don't be cross.
-We'll talk about it in the morning.

49:49.958 --> 49:50.791
[sniffles]

49:51.291 --> 49:52.666

[sighs heavily]

50:09.166 --> 50:10.083

50:21.333 --> 50:23.041
Were you outside?
