00:00.023 --> 00:01.389
Previously, on “Criminal Minds”...

00:01.391 --> 00:02.457
Reid is in jail.

00:02.459 --> 00:03.691
He was arrested in Mexico

00:03.693 --> 00:05.359
for illegal possession of drugs.

00:05.361 --> 00:07.061
Now he's being charged with
the murder of Nadie Ramos.

00:08.261 --> 00:10.361
Your client presents a flight risk.

00:10.363 --> 00:12.697
Bail is denied.
Defendant will be remanded

00:12.699 --> 00:14.299
to federal custody pending trial.

00:24.945 --> 00:27.178
8361 in the yard.

00:27.180 --> 00:30.482
Transport detail, stand by.

00:30.817 --> 00:34.519
No. No, please.

00:34.521 --> 00:37.667
Please don't make me.

00:37.857 --> 00:40.391
I'm not... I don't want to go.

00:40.393 --> 00:42.193
I don't want to go, please.

00:42.195 --> 00:43.861
Please don't make me go.

00:43.863 --> 00:46.764
Please...

00:46.766 --> 00:49.434
Hey, man, shut it!

00:50.437 --> 00:52.136
You're gonna give yourself a concussion

00:52.138 --> 00:54.938
if you keep doing that.

00:55.175 --> 00:59.406
Well, it beats what
they'll do to me inside.

00:59.479 --> 01:01.746
I'm Luis.

01:02.019 --> 01:03.592
Spencer.

01:04.016 --> 01:05.787
What are you in for?

01:06.519 --> 01:07.652
I'm innocent.

01:07.654 --> 01:08.653
Yeah...

01:10.657 --> 01:11.589
Me, too.

01:11.591 --> 01:13.391
Ok, ladies, listen up.

01:13.393 --> 01:17.228
You will exit this bus in
a neat and orderly fashion.

01:17.230 --> 01:19.864
You will speak only when spoken to,

01:19.866 --> 01:22.867
and you will do everything
that you are told.

01:22.869 --> 01:24.602
Follow these simple rules,

01:24.604 --> 01:27.135
we'll get along just fine.

01:28.008 --> 01:31.376
Let's go! Keep moving!

01:36.182 --> 01:38.301
Hurry up!

01:42.122 --> 01:44.122
Torres.

01:44.124 --> 01:45.356
Driskill.

01:45.358 --> 01:48.393
Reid.

01:48.395 --> 01:49.994
Line up over there.

01:49.996 --> 01:51.396
Hold up.

02:02.976 --> 02:04.942
You, you, go.

02:04.944 --> 02:08.369
You, back in line.

02:11.284 --> 02:12.917
Something wrong with your hearing?

02:12.919 --> 02:13.985
No...

02:13.987 --> 02:15.753
Back in line!

02:15.755 --> 02:16.921
Gate!

02:18.825 --> 02:20.358
Let's go.

02:21.194 --> 02:24.695
Left, left.

02:34.808 --> 02:37.208
Gate!

03:32.299 --> 03:34.637
You think Reid should
have taken the plea deal?

03:34.656 --> 03:35.937
Absolutely not.

03:35.937 --> 03:38.470
Now that it's off the table,
he's looking at 25 years to life.

03:38.693 --> 03:40.572
So you think he should have?

03:40.574 --> 03:44.109
No. I'm just saying,
25 years is a long time.

03:44.111 --> 03:46.611
And as we know, juries are fickle.

03:46.613 --> 03:48.535
I still can't believe
the judge denied bail.

03:48.535 --> 03:50.315
Did you guys see the look on his face

03:50.317 --> 03:52.217
when they led him out of that courtroom?

03:52.219 --> 03:53.452
What are we gonna do?

03:53.454 --> 03:55.253
Oh, newbie, oh, newbie,

03:55.255 --> 03:56.655
I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do.

03:56.657 --> 03:58.390
We're gonna send him letters every day,

03:58.392 --> 04:00.425
we're gonna put money in
his commissary account,

04:00.427 --> 04:03.996
we are going to send him
puzzles, magazines, books,

04:03.998 --> 04:05.931
whatever we can think of to make sure

04:05.933 --> 04:08.700
those gorgeous gears
inside that boy wonder brain

04:08.702 --> 04:12.504
are lubed up and in perfect
working order to keep us on track.

04:12.506 --> 04:14.239
I took the liberty of making a chart.

04:14.241 --> 04:15.807
Good idea, Penelope.

04:15.809 --> 04:17.242
Yes, I couldn't agree more.
Also, if you've noticed,

04:17.244 --> 04:19.223
there is a visitation schedule.

04:20.346 --> 04:22.830
Why do you get to go see Reid first?

04:24.084 --> 04:25.684
Because I made the chart.

04:25.686 --> 04:28.920
And if anyone has any problem
with that, tough noogies.

04:28.922 --> 04:30.455
What's all this?

04:30.457 --> 04:33.258
Uh, well, miss Penelope
here is keeping track

04:33.260 --> 04:35.436
of our correspondence
and visits to Spence.

04:35.603 --> 04:37.507
Very colorful, Penelope.

04:37.662 --> 04:38.467
Thank you, sir.

04:38.551 --> 04:39.496
Oh! And that reminds me,

04:39.496 --> 04:41.918
I'm sending the first batch of letters

04:41.918 --> 04:44.239
to Reid in jail today.
I'm going to need you

04:44.239 --> 04:47.928
to pen your upbeat, articulate missives

04:47.928 --> 04:50.519
and give them to me no
later than 3 p.m., sharp.

04:50.934 --> 04:53.335
I'm afraid you'll need
a new mailing address.

04:53.337 --> 04:54.302
What's going on?

04:54.304 --> 04:56.071
Early this morning Reid was moved

04:56.073 --> 04:59.056
from the police precinct to the
Millburn Correctional Facility.

04:59.056 --> 04:59.844
He's in prison?

04:59.844 --> 05:02.010
How is that possible?
There hasn't been a trial.

05:02.012 --> 05:04.613
You can blame overcrowding
at the D.C. jail.

05:04.615 --> 05:06.047
I know this isn't great news,

05:06.049 --> 05:07.983
but his lawyer is doing
everything she can,

05:07.985 --> 05:09.985
and she promised to give us updates.

05:09.987 --> 05:12.721
Right now, all we can do is put
our faith in the justice system

05:12.723 --> 05:16.324
and follow Garcia's chart
and work the case we just got.

05:16.326 --> 05:19.566
Oh, yeah, the case. Oh,
boy, I'll go get the files.

05:20.931 --> 05:23.265
It is with a heavy
heart, I am telling you,

05:23.267 --> 05:26.201
Philadelphia, aka, the
city of brotherly love,

05:26.203 --> 05:28.069
is in sore need of some lately,

05:28.071 --> 05:30.005
because last night, two people

05:30.007 --> 05:32.607
had acid thrown in their faces

05:32.609 --> 05:34.042
in two separate attacks.

05:34.044 --> 05:36.444
They are Colton Davis and Neela Travers.

05:36.446 --> 05:38.213
Both are being treated
at the burn center there.

05:38.215 --> 05:39.681
Neela was attacked outside a gym

05:39.683 --> 05:42.417
and has severe burns on
her face, neck, and chest.

05:42.419 --> 05:44.052
And 30 minutes later,
Colton was ambushed

05:44.054 --> 05:46.855
as he left a bar, and in
addition to being disfigured,

05:46.857 --> 05:48.790
he was partially blinded.

05:48.792 --> 05:50.458
This comes on the heels of two other

05:50.460 --> 05:52.527
acid attacks last week in Philadelphia.

05:52.529 --> 05:54.830
That's right.
Harley Macafee and Simon Wells.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.365
Harley was attacked right
outside of her apartment

05:57.367 --> 05:58.934
and Simon while on a run.

05:58.936 --> 06:01.236
Both happened on the same
night about 20 minutes apart.

06:01.238 --> 06:02.904
Simon is still hospitalized,

06:02.906 --> 06:05.807
but Harley died from
inhaling the toxic fumes.

06:05.809 --> 06:09.211
This unsub has no gender
or race preference.

06:09.213 --> 06:10.312
Any witnesses?

06:10.314 --> 06:11.847
No, but a surveillance camera

06:11.849 --> 06:14.282
captured the attack on Colton Davis.

06:22.893 --> 06:24.894
Oh!

06:25.696 --> 06:28.723
The unsub didn't stick around
to see the damage he'd done.

06:33.136 --> 06:36.838
Hey, Garcia, would you mind backing
up and freezing on the unsub?

06:36.840 --> 06:38.112
Sure thing.

06:41.912 --> 06:43.778
We're saying “he,” but it's hard to tell

06:43.780 --> 06:45.480
if the unsub is male or female.

06:45.482 --> 06:48.550
That could be a woman or
a man with a slight build.

06:48.552 --> 06:50.318
So are these coordinated blitz attacks

06:50.320 --> 06:53.321
by multiple unsubs or
the act of a lone wolf?

06:53.323 --> 06:55.590
Either way, we could be looking
at a spree in the making.

06:55.592 --> 06:56.591
Wheels up in 20.

06:58.138 --> 06:59.466
Guys, hold on.

06:59.863 --> 07:03.298
I know it's gonna be hard not
to think about Reid in prison,

07:03.300 --> 07:05.033
but we'll get through this.

07:05.035 --> 07:07.203
And more importantly, Reid will, too.

07:23.587 --> 07:25.453
What's happening?

07:25.455 --> 07:26.221
What up, homey?

07:51.081 --> 07:53.548
When you hear your name, find a bed.

07:53.550 --> 07:54.683
Archer.

07:54.685 --> 07:56.818
Delgado.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.286
Hill.

07:58.288 --> 07:59.921
Lupo.

07:59.923 --> 08:01.156
Morrone.

08:01.158 --> 08:02.290
Reid.

08:02.292 --> 08:05.527
Uh... excuse me, officer.

08:05.529 --> 08:07.262
Um, I don't belong here.

08:07.264 --> 08:09.064
Gee, I never heard that before.

08:09.066 --> 08:11.533
No, I mean, I think there's
been some sort of mistake.

08:11.535 --> 08:13.635
I'm supposed to be
in protective custody.

08:13.637 --> 08:15.370
There's been no mistake.

08:15.372 --> 08:18.540
This is exactly where you belong.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.683
You recognize any of these guys?

08:21.812 --> 08:24.646
You probably put some of
them away, didn't you...

08:24.648 --> 08:26.181
Fed?

09:16.153 --> 09:17.938
The victim from the surveillance video,

09:17.938 --> 09:18.987
Colton Davis,

09:19.016 --> 09:20.683
moved to Philadelphia last year

09:20.685 --> 09:22.384
to attend medical school at Temple.

09:22.386 --> 09:25.321
Neela Travers works in
social media marketing.

09:25.323 --> 09:27.456
Simon Wells works at an ad agency.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.860
And Harley Macafee, well,
she worked as a trainee

09:30.862 --> 09:32.628
at a brokerage firm in center city.

09:32.630 --> 09:35.431
No obvious connection other than
being 20-something and single.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.767
Well, the primary motivators
behind acid attacks

09:37.769 --> 09:39.969
are rage, jealousy, and revenge.

09:39.971 --> 09:42.171
And sexual rejection is often a trigger.

09:42.173 --> 09:44.306
In South Asia, particularly

09:44.308 --> 09:46.075
Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh,

09:46.077 --> 09:47.510
acid attacks are used against women

09:47.512 --> 09:50.012
for refusing sexual advances

09:50.014 --> 09:51.781
and proposals of marriage.

09:51.783 --> 09:53.349
The mentality being,

09:53.351 --> 09:55.551
if I can't have you, I'll
make sure no one will.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.920
Neela is of South Asian descent.

09:57.922 --> 09:59.588
Maybe she rejected the unsub.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.624
Well, political and religious beliefs

10:01.626 --> 10:02.858
are inciting factors as well.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.293
Well, in some countries, young girls

10:04.295 --> 10:05.628
have had acid thrown in their faces

10:05.630 --> 10:07.196
as a punishment for attending school,

10:07.198 --> 10:11.433
or women for wearing clothing
that was considered immodest.

10:11.435 --> 10:12.868
Hello, my...

10:12.870 --> 10:16.305
Sorry, it appears my
internal salutation generator

10:16.307 --> 10:18.274
is broken due to this
morning's gut punch.

10:18.276 --> 10:20.309
All I can come up with is hello.

10:20.311 --> 10:21.977
What do you have, Penelope?

10:21.979 --> 10:24.814
The burn center says that
highly-concentrated nitric acid

10:24.816 --> 10:26.348
was used in all 4 attacks.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.450
Well, the unsub could have
access to it through his job.

10:28.452 --> 10:30.119
I did some digging.

10:30.121 --> 10:31.887
It turns out nitric and
other corrosive acids,

10:31.889 --> 10:33.489
of which there are,
oh, so many nasty ones,

10:33.491 --> 10:35.491
are readily available
just about anywhere.

10:35.493 --> 10:38.227
Well, there gotta be
tons of DIY videos online.

10:38.229 --> 10:39.795
Yep. 35,000, to be exact.

10:39.797 --> 10:42.198
So this unsub could have
made his own concoction.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.466
Garcia, compile a list of acid sales

10:44.468 --> 10:45.734
in the tri-state area...

10:45.736 --> 10:47.937
New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.373
Also, anyone buying those
ingredients to make their own.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.309
Ooh, it's gonna be a long list.

10:53.311 --> 10:55.277
If the kid were here,
he'd probably rattle off

10:55.279 --> 10:57.012
every acid known to man,

10:57.014 --> 10:58.647
their chemical properties,

10:58.649 --> 11:01.175
plus their sales down to the milliliter.

11:03.221 --> 11:06.889
When we land, Tara and I will
coordinate with the locals.

11:06.891 --> 11:08.623
The rest of you head to the burn center.

11:12.436 --> 11:14.735
_

11:14.832 --> 11:17.867
Are Colton and Neela
able to speak with us?

11:17.869 --> 11:19.902
They'll be a little
groggy from the pain meds,

11:19.904 --> 11:21.103
but yes, they are.

11:21.105 --> 11:22.404
What about Simon?

11:22.406 --> 11:23.339
He's in the O.R. right now

11:23.341 --> 11:25.341
undergoing another skin graft.

11:25.343 --> 11:26.575
How extensive are their injuries?

11:26.577 --> 11:28.944
The acid ate away skin, fat layers,

11:28.946 --> 11:30.546
and in the case of Neela Travers,

11:30.548 --> 11:32.081
dissolved some of her underlying bone.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.483
Colton's in danger of losing sight

11:34.485 --> 11:36.018
in his other eye, too.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.042
This is Colton's room.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.455
And Neela is over there.

11:42.593 --> 11:44.894
Agents, if the person who did this

11:44.896 --> 11:47.863
wanted to inflict maximum
pain and suffering,

11:47.865 --> 11:49.932
they got their wish.

11:49.934 --> 11:52.935
Colton, I'm Agent Rossi.

11:52.937 --> 11:54.803
This is Agent Alvez.

11:54.805 --> 11:57.506
We're with the FBI.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.061
Can we ask you a few questions?

12:01.212 --> 12:04.413
Did you see who attacked you?

12:04.415 --> 12:06.148
No.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.883
It happened too fast.

12:07.885 --> 12:11.220
What do you remember?

12:11.222 --> 12:13.022
Just the pain.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.671
It was like I was on fire.

12:16.394 --> 12:19.328
Neela, did you notice
anything about your attacker?

12:19.330 --> 12:21.397
He was short.

12:21.399 --> 12:25.197
He had a black coat and hat.

12:26.504 --> 12:28.504
And gloves, brown.

12:28.506 --> 12:30.039
And you're sure it was a man?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.507
Yes.

12:31.509 --> 12:34.206
Can you think of anyone
who would want to hurt you?

12:35.780 --> 12:37.212
No.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.882
Did you get into an argument
recently with anyone?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.584
Um, classmate, one of your roommates?

12:42.586 --> 12:44.019
No.

12:44.021 --> 12:45.721
No one.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.523
You ever been to that bar before?

12:47.525 --> 12:49.861
Every Tuesday night.

12:49.927 --> 12:52.543
What's so special about Tuesday nights?

12:52.897 --> 12:55.364
My buddies and I, we have night classes,

12:55.366 --> 12:56.799
and we meet up afterwards.

12:56.801 --> 12:59.568
You take the same spin
class every Tuesday night?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.738
Mm-hmm. I like the instructor.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.841
Does the name Colton Davis
mean anything to you?

13:05.843 --> 13:09.178
No. Why? Did he do this to me?

13:10.514 --> 13:12.982
Neela Travers? I don't know her.

13:12.984 --> 13:14.917
One last question,

13:14.919 --> 13:17.853
and then we'll let you get some rest.

13:17.855 --> 13:21.190
Did your attacker say anything to you?

13:21.192 --> 13:24.126
It sounded like a foreign language.

13:26.063 --> 13:29.465
Do you remember any of the words?

13:29.467 --> 13:31.967
I'm sorry. I'm not helping, am I?

13:31.969 --> 13:35.004
Oh, Neela. Neela, you're doing great.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.378
Neela's description of her attacker

13:42.380 --> 13:45.948
appears to match the unsub
we saw ambushing Colton

13:45.950 --> 13:47.383
in the security video.

13:47.385 --> 13:50.052
Yeah. And they both heard
him shouting something,

13:50.054 --> 13:51.286
maybe in a different language.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.389
If Colton and Neela kept a routine,

13:53.391 --> 13:55.224
it's possible the unsub
knew where they would be.

13:55.226 --> 13:56.725
He could have stalked them.

13:56.727 --> 13:58.694
Which may mean that the
victimology isn't random.

13:58.696 --> 14:01.063
The unsub could have a
connection to the victims,

14:01.065 --> 14:02.831
even if they don't know it.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.513
What's your problem, perv?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.988
Excuse me, did you see what
happened to my things? They were...

15:08.933 --> 15:12.334
Hi. I, uh, I'm sure it's
just a misunderstanding,

15:12.336 --> 15:14.937
but I believe those are mine.

15:14.939 --> 15:15.904
No.

15:17.608 --> 15:19.174
I'm pretty sure they are.

15:20.511 --> 15:22.177
You callin' me a liar?

15:22.179 --> 15:24.446
Here we go.

15:24.448 --> 15:25.414
I'm not... I'm not saying that,

15:25.416 --> 15:27.382
but those are my things.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.886
How they got here, I don't know, but...

15:30.888 --> 15:33.802
I'm gonna take them back now.

15:33.924 --> 15:37.967
Excuse me. Just gonna
grab this stuff and walk...

15:41.932 --> 15:45.400
Ooh, damn.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.802
Hey, break it up!

15:46.804 --> 15:47.903
Break it up!

15:47.905 --> 15:50.889
I said, break it up.

15:53.377 --> 15:55.611
Get lost, inmate.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.424
Am I gonna have to write you up?

16:09.426 --> 16:10.959
That inmate stole my things.

16:10.961 --> 16:13.195
Guess that'll teach you how
to keep track of your stuff.

16:13.197 --> 16:15.164
Well, aren't you gonna
do something about it?

16:15.166 --> 16:16.832
I just did.

16:16.834 --> 16:18.861
I saved your ass.

16:18.969 --> 16:21.803
Now step back, inmate.

16:21.805 --> 16:23.272
Or I'll let everyone here know

16:23.274 --> 16:26.375
who and what you are.

16:34.669 --> 16:36.638
_

16:36.654 --> 16:38.820
Here are the reports
on the earlier attacks

16:38.822 --> 16:40.789
on Harley Macafee and Simon Wells.

16:40.791 --> 16:41.957
Thank you.

16:42.159 --> 16:44.493
There were no witnesses
to the assault on Harley.

16:44.495 --> 16:46.828
Unfortunately, she never
regained consciousness

16:46.830 --> 16:47.896
before she died.

16:47.898 --> 16:49.298
Simon described his attacker

16:49.300 --> 16:50.465
just as Colton and Neela did.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.134
A man in a dark coat and baseball cap

16:52.136 --> 16:53.769
shouting some kind of gibberish.

16:53.771 --> 16:56.004
It looks like the same unsub is
responsible for all the attacks.

16:56.006 --> 16:57.372
Garcia, go ahead.

16:57.374 --> 16:58.941
I'm going through the social media sites

16:58.943 --> 17:00.275
of our 4 victims.

17:00.277 --> 17:01.677
What'd you find?

17:01.679 --> 17:03.078
Oh, the usual selfies,
pictures of food they've eaten,

17:03.080 --> 17:04.980
really adorable pet antics.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.849
Uh, also, here is a nugget
that might float your boat.

17:08.852 --> 17:10.618
Last month, the first two victims,

17:10.621 --> 17:13.555
Simon and Harley, attended
singles nights events

17:13.557 --> 17:16.290
at Manayunk at the
aptly-named Brewerytown.

17:16.292 --> 17:18.527
Those are popular neighborhoods
with the younger crowd.

17:18.529 --> 17:20.262
Lots of bars and music venues.

17:20.263 --> 17:21.563
Were they there at the same time?

17:21.565 --> 17:22.998
No, different nights.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.434
But the unsub might
have been at both events.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.902
That could be where he
started stalking them.

17:26.904 --> 17:29.504
He could have picked out any
number of people to stalk,

17:29.506 --> 17:32.789
which means at this moment,
he could be targeting his next victim.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.945
Do you want to try that
new Thai place tonight?

17:36.947 --> 17:38.380
Sounds good.

17:38.382 --> 17:39.982
Ok. Are you cold?

17:39.984 --> 17:41.250
A little.

17:41.252 --> 17:43.952
Here.

17:45.489 --> 17:47.723
Et disperdam illud!

17:56.626 --> 17:57.758
Like his other victims,

17:57.760 --> 17:59.460
the unsub targeted a man and a woman,

17:59.462 --> 18:02.029
but changed his M.O. and
attacked them together.

18:02.850 --> 18:05.084
And this time he attacked
in broad daylight.

18:05.086 --> 18:06.385
He's getting bolder.

18:06.387 --> 18:07.786
Or reckless.

18:07.788 --> 18:10.155
The victims are David Turner

18:10.157 --> 18:11.824
and Brandy Moore.

18:11.826 --> 18:13.959
A woman walking her dog nearby

18:13.961 --> 18:19.064
said she heard a man shout,
“et disperdam illud”"

18:19.066 --> 18:20.833
seconds before the attack.

18:20.835 --> 18:24.236
It's Latin. It could be the
foreign-sounding language

18:24.238 --> 18:26.138
Neela and Colton said they heard.

18:26.140 --> 18:27.539
My Latin's a little rusty.

18:27.541 --> 18:31.076
It means, “I will destroy it.”

18:31.078 --> 18:33.412
12 years of Catholic school.

18:33.414 --> 18:36.682
So, what's he want to destroy?

18:36.684 --> 18:39.518
That particular Latin
phrase is from the Bible,

18:39.520 --> 18:40.986
Jeremiah, chapter 18.

18:40.988 --> 18:43.122
In it, it's talking
about how God handles

18:43.124 --> 18:44.556
nations and kingdoms

18:44.558 --> 18:45.858
and that he can mold them

18:45.860 --> 18:47.559
as easily as a potter molds clay.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.628
So maybe this unsub
sees himself as a God,

18:49.630 --> 18:52.664
and these victims represent
nations and kingdoms to punish.

18:52.666 --> 18:55.401
“I will destroy it.”

18:55.403 --> 18:57.002
Elliot Rodger, the mass shooter

18:57.004 --> 18:58.404
in Isla Vista, California,

18:58.406 --> 18:59.905
wrote something similar
in his manifesto.

18:59.907 --> 19:01.607
And when I was with the BAP,

19:01.609 --> 19:04.109
we were looking at it for any
possible ties to terrorism.

19:04.111 --> 19:05.544
Garcia, see if you can pull it up.

19:05.546 --> 19:07.312
See if I can? You doubt me?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.214
Sir, excuse me while I bulldoze my way

19:09.216 --> 19:12.017
through 137 pages of
manifesto muck and mire

19:12.019 --> 19:13.152
without even cracking my lip gloss.

19:13.154 --> 19:14.353
I remember Rodger.

19:14.355 --> 19:16.321
He became enraged whenever he saw

19:16.323 --> 19:17.923
pretty young women or couples together.

19:17.925 --> 19:20.526
That's right. He wanted to
stop everyone, men and women,

19:20.528 --> 19:21.693
from having sex.

19:21.695 --> 19:24.363
He was a follower
of the manosphere.

19:24.365 --> 19:25.431
What's that?

19:25.433 --> 19:26.765
It's a collection of websites,

19:26.767 --> 19:28.867
blogs, and Internet forums
focused on male culture.

19:28.869 --> 19:30.369
With a few exceptions,

19:30.371 --> 19:32.871
it mostly spews misogynistic
and hate-filled rhetoric.

19:32.873 --> 19:34.106
And Walker wins the prize.

19:34.108 --> 19:35.707
The various last page,
Rodger says, quote,

19:35.709 --> 19:39.078
“if I cannot have it, I will do
everything I can to destroy it.”

19:39.080 --> 19:41.747
So all 6 victims are
young and good-looking.

19:41.749 --> 19:43.982
Maybe the unsub feels
the way Rodger did.

19:43.984 --> 19:46.585
Uh, guys, there's
a man-o-sphere site

19:46.587 --> 19:48.120
I think you should see.

19:48.122 --> 19:50.355
It's called “no means yes,”

19:50.357 --> 19:52.591
and they have a weekly feature called

19:52.593 --> 19:54.960
“Alpha male bad-ass bitch,”

19:54.962 --> 19:58.864
where they post pictures of
young, attractive men and women,

19:58.866 --> 20:00.632
and users are encouraged to mock them

20:00.634 --> 20:02.201
for their shiny hair, perfect teeth,

20:02.203 --> 20:04.937
washboard abs, and “the hot sex

20:04.939 --> 20:08.273
they are no doubt
having and you're not.”

20:08.275 --> 20:10.843
Look, guys, check this out.
Do you see what I see?

20:10.845 --> 20:13.846
The victims could be dead-ringers
for the people in these photos.

20:13.848 --> 20:17.116
This unsub wants to do
more than mock these people.

20:17.118 --> 20:18.984
He wants to destroy them. In his mind,

20:18.986 --> 20:21.866
they're living the life
that he wants but can't have.

20:22.256 --> 20:24.022
It's time to deliver the profile.

20:24.024 --> 20:28.060
We're looking for a white male,
20 to 30 years old, a narcissist.

20:28.062 --> 20:31.029
He appears to be a follower
of the manosphere,

20:31.031 --> 20:34.399
a real and often disturbing
corner of the Internet.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.169
In the extreme, it
advocates for the overthrow

20:37.171 --> 20:39.838
if what it calls the
oppressive feminist culture.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.940
It also teaches degrading
pickup techniques

20:41.942 --> 20:44.076
and envisions a world
where women fear men.

20:44.078 --> 20:45.911
But it also pits men against each other,

20:45.913 --> 20:48.714
labeling them either Alphas or Betas.

20:48.716 --> 20:52.050
Alphas are described as
dominant and uber masculine,

20:52.052 --> 20:54.086
an ideal to be envied or copied.

20:54.088 --> 20:55.988
This unsub has feelings of entitlement,

20:55.990 --> 20:58.524
but at the same time is
probably socially awkward

20:58.526 --> 21:00.159
and unsuccessful with women.

21:00.161 --> 21:01.727
He sees himself as a catch,

21:01.729 --> 21:04.530
a true Alpha male who has
been overlooked by women

21:04.532 --> 21:06.899
and is superior to the
men they choose over him.

21:06.901 --> 21:08.834
His rage may stem from incidents

21:08.836 --> 21:11.036
of unrequited love early in his life.

21:11.038 --> 21:13.906
Rebuffed by women and feeling
threatened by the competition,

21:13.908 --> 21:16.642
he's throwing acid on his victims

21:16.644 --> 21:18.310
to inflict maximum pain,

21:18.312 --> 21:19.978
both physically and emotionally.

21:19.980 --> 21:23.949
He wants both sexes to
feel as ugly, as unwanted,

21:23.951 --> 21:26.685
and as self-loathing as he does inside.

21:26.687 --> 21:28.754
It appears he's targeting
attractive men and women

21:28.756 --> 21:31.823
who resemble photos posted
on the manosphere website,

21:31.825 --> 21:33.258
“no means yes.”

21:33.260 --> 21:35.394
This could turn into a spree,

21:35.396 --> 21:37.563
with more attacks coming
at any time, anywhere.

21:37.565 --> 21:39.064
Thank you.

21:54.949 --> 21:56.815
You got some brass stones, man.

21:56.817 --> 21:57.751
What do you mean?

21:58.018 --> 21:59.585
They're gonna be gunning
for you. You got a plan?

21:59.587 --> 22:00.619
Who?

22:00.621 --> 22:03.085
They're coming.

22:06.527 --> 22:08.026
What's up?

22:08.028 --> 22:09.294
Hey.

22:09.296 --> 22:10.429
Got any bats?

22:10.431 --> 22:11.396
Bats?

22:11.398 --> 22:12.598
Cigarettes.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.367
Oh, no, sorry. No, I don't smoke.

22:15.369 --> 22:17.937
Yeah, I'm gonna quit.

22:18.439 --> 22:20.138
You ok, man?

22:20.140 --> 22:23.475
Yeah. I-I'm ok. Thanks.

22:23.477 --> 22:24.843
Does he look ok to you?

22:24.845 --> 22:27.045
Nah. Looks like he's gonna cry.

22:27.047 --> 22:28.080
Or wet his pants.

22:30.251 --> 22:31.783
Don't go. We're just messin'.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.719
Out of respect, you know?

22:33.721 --> 22:36.088
It's all over the yard
how you stole from Milos.

22:36.090 --> 22:38.223
I didn't steal from Milos.
That was my stuff.

22:38.225 --> 22:39.725
No. That was a tribute.

22:39.727 --> 22:42.127
Everyone has to pay
when they join the group.

22:42.129 --> 22:43.195
What group?

22:43.197 --> 22:44.363
You're kiddin', right?

22:44.365 --> 22:46.198
Take a look around.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.726
They outnumber us.

22:48.936 --> 22:50.602
So we gotta stick together.

22:50.604 --> 22:53.572
In here, we're the minority.

22:53.574 --> 22:56.241
I'm not interested. Thanks, anyway.

22:56.243 --> 22:58.343
Yeah, that's not the
way this is gonna go.

22:58.345 --> 23:00.212
Hey, Hicks.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.780
I see Tony O. over there.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.115
He's waiting for us.

23:03.117 --> 23:04.783
Ok, my man, we gotta go.

23:04.785 --> 23:06.118
No worries.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.419
Catch you tonight.

23:35.182 --> 23:36.682
Garcia, what have you got?

23:36.684 --> 23:40.986
I have a great deal of rage and sorrow

23:40.988 --> 23:44.222
over reading a whole bunch of
sexist, racist, and homophobic rants.

23:44.224 --> 23:46.058
The “no means yes” website.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.426
Yes. And by that, I mean yes.

23:47.428 --> 23:51.663
I am compiling a list
of manosphere users

23:51.665 --> 23:53.699
and subscribers and cross-checking

23:53.701 --> 23:55.500
this “I will destroy it” phrase

23:55.502 --> 23:58.570
with acid sales and...

23:58.572 --> 24:00.238
Oh, they just posted new photos.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.773
Get them to us. Let's hope

24:01.775 --> 24:03.575
we can be one step ahead of this unsub.

24:03.577 --> 24:05.577
Sending.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.187
Ok, settle down.

24:49.189 --> 24:51.056
Settle... shut up!

25:02.970 --> 25:04.503
Lights out!

25:06.473 --> 25:08.978
Tier guard, lock down!

25:18.952 --> 25:20.806
It's party time.

25:28.930 --> 25:30.063
Help!

25:30.065 --> 25:31.264
Aah!

25:31.266 --> 25:32.298
Help! Help!

25:45.947 --> 25:48.581
So you're too good to be with us?

25:48.583 --> 25:51.584
We offer you friendship
and what do you do?

25:51.586 --> 25:53.219
Spit in our faces.

25:53.221 --> 25:55.021
Thinks he can survive
in here without our help.

25:55.023 --> 25:56.256
Uhh!

25:56.258 --> 25:59.526
You, you need to show some respect.

25:59.528 --> 26:01.928
- Yeah.
- Do it.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.228
Back off.

26:03.826 --> 26:05.125
Now.

26:11.406 --> 26:12.939
Untie him.

26:17.746 --> 26:18.812
Get out of here.

26:18.814 --> 26:20.480
Go on, take off.

26:27.589 --> 26:30.423
Latest victim, Melinda Carroll.

26:30.425 --> 26:33.226
Taught high school Math,
lives in Chestnut Hill.

26:33.228 --> 26:34.928
Garcia said she didn't
find any connection

26:34.930 --> 26:36.462
between her and the other victims.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.923
Ok. See you when you get here.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.234
Prentiss and Walker are heading back.

26:41.236 --> 26:44.737
Melinda is in acute
respiratory distress.

26:44.739 --> 26:45.972
She was put on a ventilator

26:45.974 --> 26:47.607
before anyone could talk to her.

26:47.609 --> 26:50.443
Melinda looks nothing
like the latest photo

26:50.445 --> 26:52.178
posted on the “no means yes” website.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.080
Why did the unsub target her?

26:54.082 --> 26:56.950
And why risk being seen
in a busy parking garage?

26:56.952 --> 26:59.252
Maybe his need-based
compulsion was too great

26:59.254 --> 27:01.521
and he couldn't wait to
find a red-headed look-alike.

27:01.523 --> 27:02.856
Yeah, I thought the same,

27:02.858 --> 27:04.724
but the police said they
talked to a young woman

27:04.726 --> 27:06.259
that was in the garage at the time.

27:06.261 --> 27:07.360
She was a redhead.

27:07.362 --> 27:09.262
Did Melinda routinely park there?

27:09.264 --> 27:10.296
It doesn't say.

27:10.298 --> 27:12.198
According to a George Cunningham,

27:12.200 --> 27:14.300
they were meeting there for a date,

27:14.302 --> 27:16.502
he arrived late,
found her on the ground.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.538
Well, if Melinda can't talk,
maybe her date can help us

27:18.540 --> 27:19.706
figure out why she was targeted.

27:19.708 --> 27:22.141
What if George is our unsub?

27:22.143 --> 27:24.244
If he's desperate for
love and affection,

27:24.246 --> 27:26.412
why would he attack a woman

27:26.414 --> 27:28.081
that was actually willing
to go out with him?

27:28.083 --> 27:30.049
We profiled he's a narcissist.

27:30.051 --> 27:31.718
Maybe he fed into those photos,

27:31.720 --> 27:33.553
thought that she wasn't
good enough for him,

27:33.555 --> 27:34.821
that he can do better.

27:34.823 --> 27:37.457
Or, she could have
rejected him sexually.

27:40.148 --> 27:43.606
Garcia, we need everything
you have on George Cunningham.

27:43.934 --> 27:45.968
We were going to the museum of art.

27:45.970 --> 27:47.936
Neither of us had
ever been there before.

27:47.938 --> 27:49.605
Why not just meet at the museum?

27:49.607 --> 27:53.542
You know? Go up the steps,
do the whole “Rocky” thing.

27:53.544 --> 27:55.978
We'd joke about it, but
Melinda is what you'd call

27:55.980 --> 27:57.379
directionally-challenged.

27:57.381 --> 27:59.715
We were gonna walk to
the museum together.

27:59.717 --> 28:01.350
How long have you guys been dating?

28:01.352 --> 28:02.684
It's only been 6 weeks,

28:02.686 --> 28:04.620
but I think she could be the one.

28:04.622 --> 28:05.721
Ah, that's great.

28:05.723 --> 28:07.990
So you guys tell each other everything.

28:07.992 --> 28:10.959
So then you told her
about the, uh, comments

28:10.961 --> 28:14.563
that you made on a website
called “no means yes”?

28:15.900 --> 28:17.733
How did you...

28:17.735 --> 28:19.234
I didn't say...

28:19.236 --> 28:22.905
You didn't write, “if the
bitch wants a big wedding,

28:22.907 --> 28:23.872
dump her”?

28:23.874 --> 28:25.073
Or this one.

28:25.075 --> 28:27.209
Hang on a second.

28:27.211 --> 28:29.778
“Be strong, learn game,

28:29.780 --> 28:32.748
get laid. And don't trust women”?

28:32.750 --> 28:33.815
Or, there's my favorite...

28:33.817 --> 28:35.784
Ok, ok. I posted those things,

28:35.786 --> 28:37.252
but I don't really believe that.

28:37.254 --> 28:39.156
Then why did you write it?

28:39.490 --> 28:41.590
I don't know.

28:41.592 --> 28:44.790
I was lonely, feeling sorry for myself.

28:45.496 --> 28:47.150
I wanted people to think I was a player.

28:47.820 --> 28:50.287
But all that was before I met Melinda.

28:53.226 --> 28:56.527
Did anyone else know about
your plans to go to the museum?

28:56.529 --> 28:57.862
Some friends.

28:57.864 --> 28:59.897
Friends, from the manosphere?

28:59.899 --> 29:02.700
Yeah. We talk about lots of stuff.

29:02.702 --> 29:04.034
Like what?

29:04.036 --> 29:06.170
Cars, sports.

29:06.172 --> 29:10.641
Most of the time we just
complain about being incels.

29:10.643 --> 29:12.943
It's slang for involuntary celibate.

29:12.945 --> 29:15.379
But now, with Melinda...

29:15.381 --> 29:17.462
You're not a virgin anymore.

29:17.884 --> 29:22.019
How did the other incels feel
about that when they heard?

29:22.021 --> 29:23.220
Most were happy for me.

29:23.222 --> 29:24.997
But not everybody.

29:25.491 --> 29:28.092
I just chalked it up to being jealous.

29:28.094 --> 29:30.506
How many of your friends
know what Melinda looks like?

29:30.997 --> 29:32.596
I've posted pictures of us.

29:32.598 --> 29:35.266
All right, we're gonna need
their contact information.

29:40.373 --> 29:42.006
Hi.

29:42.008 --> 29:44.742
There wasn't really time
for proper introductions.

29:44.744 --> 29:45.676
My name's Spencer...

29:45.678 --> 29:48.846
Reid. Calvin Shaw.

29:49.015 --> 29:51.230
Guessing you already knew that.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.484
Come on in.

29:56.022 --> 29:57.087
Hey, coffee?

29:57.089 --> 29:58.790
Sure.

30:00.993 --> 30:03.661
You were with the Bureau
in Detroit, until 2005.

30:03.663 --> 30:05.563
Right up until I got arrested.

30:05.565 --> 30:07.166
Have a seat.

30:07.466 --> 30:09.133
Thanks.

30:11.504 --> 30:12.670
You know why I'm in here?

30:12.672 --> 30:14.905
You killed your criminal informant.

30:17.143 --> 30:18.676
Elena Olegnova.

30:18.678 --> 30:21.045
She was feeding us information

30:21.047 --> 30:24.048
about shipments of heroin
being funneled to the city

30:24.050 --> 30:27.218
by the Bratva. Russian mafia.

30:27.220 --> 30:28.853
What she gave us was credible.

30:28.855 --> 30:32.189
But after a while, she began
to know things she shouldn't.

30:32.191 --> 30:34.291
My gut told me something wasn't right.

30:34.293 --> 30:36.327
I always trust my gut.

30:36.329 --> 30:38.362
She was working with the Bratva?

30:38.364 --> 30:40.865
Threatened to expose
our undercover agents.

30:40.867 --> 30:42.333
They'd have been tortured and killed.

30:42.335 --> 30:43.634
I couldn't let that happen.

30:43.636 --> 30:45.669
I had to make a decision.

30:45.671 --> 30:47.137
You could have arrested her.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.939
Then our guys would have
been killed instantly.

30:48.941 --> 30:51.208
Had to make it look like a
rival to save their lives.

30:51.210 --> 30:54.511
Wrong decision? Definitely.

30:54.513 --> 30:57.014
Right reason? Absolutely.

30:57.016 --> 30:59.034
What about you?

30:59.318 --> 31:00.851
You kill that doctor in Mexico?

31:00.853 --> 31:01.886
No.

31:01.888 --> 31:03.287
Hmm.

31:06.192 --> 31:07.892
Thanks, man.

31:07.894 --> 31:09.093
Thank you.

31:09.095 --> 31:10.628
You want milk?

31:10.630 --> 31:13.831
I'm ok.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.499
So, how long till your trial?

31:15.501 --> 31:17.501
Uh, my lawyer says maybe 3 months.

31:17.503 --> 31:19.837
3 months?

31:19.839 --> 31:20.905
You like to read?

31:20.907 --> 31:23.444
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

31:23.943 --> 31:25.643
You won't get library
privileges while you're here,

31:25.645 --> 31:28.245
so if there's anything
you want, you let me know,

31:28.247 --> 31:29.780
I'll get it. First few months

31:29.782 --> 31:32.583
are the worst. Having a book would help.

31:33.719 --> 31:36.987
Have you read this one?

31:36.989 --> 31:40.124
It's about these
fishermen in the North Sea.

31:40.126 --> 31:42.660
Bad-ass dudes. Warriors, really.

31:42.662 --> 31:44.361
Storm comes out of nowhere.

31:44.363 --> 31:47.164
It's a surprise. They all drown.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.319
They fight it.

31:49.535 --> 31:52.937
This is our ocean.

31:52.939 --> 31:54.838
One day it's calm, the next day

31:54.840 --> 31:57.141
there are waves the size of mountains.

31:57.143 --> 31:59.310
It'll be hard at first,

31:59.312 --> 32:03.380
but trust me, you shouldn't fight it.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.650
You just gotta learn how to survive.

32:07.153 --> 32:10.220
Garcia, what did George's
friends from the manosphere

32:10.222 --> 32:12.089
have to say about his
relationship with Melinda?

32:12.091 --> 32:14.992
Of the 20 contacts he gave us,

32:14.994 --> 32:17.628
15 of them emailed him
saying they were happy

32:17.630 --> 32:19.463
that he finally had someone

32:19.465 --> 32:21.999
and was getting laid.

32:22.001 --> 32:23.267
Their words, not mine.

32:23.269 --> 32:24.535
And the other 5?

32:24.537 --> 32:27.071
Uh, one of them said
that monogamy is evil

32:27.073 --> 32:28.605
and against basic human rights.

32:28.607 --> 32:31.508
Do any of the 5 live
or work in the area?

32:31.510 --> 32:34.845
Uh, two. Jared Bahktra
and Alan Crawford.

32:34.847 --> 32:36.651
What's their deal?

32:37.249 --> 32:40.484
Jared is 29, he works as a barista

32:40.486 --> 32:42.953
in south Philly. Ah...

32:42.955 --> 32:46.256
Oh. Jared keeps a log
of his sexual conquests.

32:46.258 --> 32:48.726
He rates the woman's face, body,

32:48.728 --> 32:50.494
and personality traits with a number.

32:50.496 --> 32:52.997
By reducing women to
numerical components,

32:52.999 --> 32:55.466
he may delude himself into
thinking he's better than they are.

32:55.468 --> 32:58.335
The unsub wants to stop
people from having sex,

32:58.337 --> 33:00.437
not rack up his numbers.

33:00.439 --> 33:01.905
What about Alan Crawford?

33:01.907 --> 33:06.069
Alan is 27. He lives
in Germantown, and...

33:06.278 --> 33:08.379
Holy hole in a doughnut,
he's a supply clerk

33:08.381 --> 33:09.613
at Tyrell Chemical.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.515
What did his email to George say?

33:11.517 --> 33:13.917
Uh, it said that he couldn't understand

33:13.919 --> 33:15.185
why George had a woman and he didn't,

33:15.187 --> 33:17.254
why women give their
sex and love to other men

33:17.256 --> 33:20.858
while he, Alan, is
clearly the superior one.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.659
When George started
dating and having sex,

33:22.661 --> 33:23.827
that must have been the trigger.

33:23.829 --> 33:26.163
Yeah. Without his friend to commiserate

33:26.165 --> 33:27.297
and share his pain with,

33:27.299 --> 33:28.799
Alan must have felt even more alone.

33:28.801 --> 33:31.635
He needs to be heard, validated.

33:31.637 --> 33:33.037
It's like Elliot Rodger.

33:33.039 --> 33:35.711
He could have written his own manifesto.

33:36.342 --> 33:39.209
Could have and did, and it's a doozy.

33:39.211 --> 33:41.765
Hold on to your capes.
You gotta see this.

33:44.016 --> 33:46.583
Ooh. 118 pages.

33:46.585 --> 33:48.752
“I can only take so much.

33:48.754 --> 33:50.687
“I've been rejected, humiliated,

33:50.689 --> 33:52.623
and ridiculed for the last time.”

33:52.625 --> 33:54.258
“All that pleasure they've had,

33:54.260 --> 33:56.460
I will make the animals pay.”

33:56.462 --> 33:58.829
“On the day of reckoning
you will know my name

33:58.831 --> 34:00.431
and fall to your knees in fear.”

34:00.433 --> 34:04.234
“Remember my name, for I
will live forever in infamy.”

34:04.236 --> 34:05.889
He's planning a major attack.

34:05.889 --> 34:07.427
Yeah, but when and where?

34:07.427 --> 34:10.737
According to this, it's tonight,
but he doesn't say where.

34:11.177 --> 34:12.708
He'll have clues in his writing.

34:12.710 --> 34:14.478
Ok, I'll comb through
the manifesto with Tara.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.563
Garcia, we need Alan's
home and work addresses.

34:16.563 --> 34:17.504
Sending now.

34:28.928 --> 34:30.527
He's not here.

34:30.529 --> 34:33.964
Looks like he was busy before he left.

34:33.966 --> 34:35.699
Rossi, take a look at this.

34:35.701 --> 34:38.335
These are plans for how
to modify a power sprayer.

34:38.337 --> 34:42.081
He's going to destroy
as many lives as he can.

34:46.827 --> 34:48.159
So when Alan was 10,

34:48.161 --> 34:49.661
his parents went
through a nasty break-up.

34:49.663 --> 34:51.295
His mother gave up custody,

34:51.297 --> 34:52.998
and then within days of the divorce,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.333
his father married Alan's nanny.

34:55.335 --> 34:57.936
He claims his new stepmother
didn't want him around.

34:57.938 --> 34:59.738
He was shipped off to boarding school,

34:59.740 --> 35:02.074
where he said he was bullied and lonely.

35:02.076 --> 35:05.711
Alan's felt rejection his whole life.

35:05.713 --> 35:08.080
So the first two victims
attended singles nights

35:08.082 --> 35:09.748
in bars around the city.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.416
He wrote something about
events like that. Let me see.

35:11.418 --> 35:14.319
Um...”it's where all the
good-looking people gather

35:14.321 --> 35:16.054
and pair off like animals.”

35:16.056 --> 35:20.192
He said something about bringing
the animals pain and suffering.

35:20.194 --> 35:23.128
He's gonna spray acid
at another singles night.

35:25.199 --> 35:26.698
Bring it.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.368
Are there any singles night
events in Philly tonight?

35:29.370 --> 35:30.569
There are 3. There's
one in north Philly,

35:30.571 --> 35:32.037
one in Kensington, and one in Fishtown.

35:32.039 --> 35:33.438
- Which one is it?
- We don't know.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.973
Damn it. What did he say?

35:34.975 --> 35:38.677
Ok. “I will wear my leather
jacket. I look good in that.

35:38.679 --> 35:42.047
“Then I'll tap mac
and a fitting final meal

35:42.049 --> 35:44.182
one whiz whiz next door.”

35:44.184 --> 35:45.918
I... I... I don't... I have
no idea what that means.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.252
Ok, tap mac.

35:47.254 --> 35:49.521
Uh, my roommate in
college was from Philly.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.623
She would say that when
she needed to get cash.

35:51.625 --> 35:52.858
It means going to an ATM.

35:52.860 --> 35:54.760
Uh...

35:54.762 --> 35:58.830
Mac. Was formally known as the
Money Access Center.

35:58.832 --> 36:01.600
It was in the northeast,
especially Philadelphia,

36:01.602 --> 36:04.136
from the eighties until the year 2000.

36:04.138 --> 36:05.871
Most folks in the region
still use that term.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.773
Ok, and “one whiz whiz”?

36:07.775 --> 36:10.642
That is a cheesesteak with
cheez whiz and fried onions.

36:10.644 --> 36:14.479
Garcia, is there an ATM and a
hoagie shop near any of those 3 bars?

36:14.481 --> 36:17.015
I... See...

36:17.017 --> 36:21.187
Yes! There's one in
Kensington by the Federal Bar.

36:21.355 --> 36:23.088
Rossi, we know where.

36:24.191 --> 36:27.492
♪ Burning like a fire ♪

36:27.494 --> 36:31.330
♪ we were hypnotized ♪

36:51.085 --> 36:54.720
Man, I just came to
watch the game tonight.

36:54.722 --> 36:57.255
This place is lit.

37:00.327 --> 37:02.661
Guess there's some
singles thing goin' on.

37:02.663 --> 37:05.263
Most of these guys are
just wasting their time,

37:05.265 --> 37:08.166
poor bastards.

37:08.168 --> 37:11.646
We all know who's getting the
hot women tonight, don't we?

37:17.277 --> 37:19.745
Hey, beer.

37:19.747 --> 37:21.480
Hey, you by yourself?

37:21.482 --> 37:25.611
And another one for my friend here.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.619
No, hey, no, no, man.

37:27.621 --> 37:31.023
Put your wallet away. It's on me.

37:33.661 --> 37:35.394
It's not really fair, is it?

37:35.396 --> 37:38.430
I mean, why do some people
get to have love and sex

37:38.432 --> 37:40.132
and pleasure in life

37:40.134 --> 37:42.898
and others don't?

37:43.570 --> 37:44.903
They don't deserve it.

37:44.905 --> 37:46.905
It's gotta be the worst
feeling in the world

37:46.907 --> 37:51.843
not to be able to love a
woman and be loved back.

37:51.845 --> 37:55.201
Not to be seen for who you really are.

37:55.582 --> 37:57.849
Isn't that right, Alan?

37:57.851 --> 38:00.318
Hey, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.354
I'm with the FBI.

38:02.356 --> 38:04.956
And right now, several
guns are trained on you.

38:04.958 --> 38:06.658
You use that sprayer, and believe me,

38:06.660 --> 38:09.494
you will be dead before our drinks come.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.596
They need to feel my pain.

38:11.598 --> 38:14.958
And they will if you
come with me calmly.

38:14.968 --> 38:18.970
I'll make sure your manifesto
gets out to the world.

38:45.165 --> 38:46.865
Stop.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.600
Get in there.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.371
Don't get too comfortable.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.174
Door!

39:10.624 --> 39:12.591
Welcome to the neighborhood.

39:14.294 --> 39:15.460
Hey, Reid.

39:15.462 --> 39:16.595
Yeah?

39:17.397 --> 39:19.431
Any chance you play chess?

39:28.776 --> 39:30.375
Whoo whoo.

39:30.377 --> 39:33.411
The unicorn of Pony Express awaits.

39:33.413 --> 39:35.013
All done.

39:35.015 --> 39:36.615
That's everyone's letters to Reid.

39:36.617 --> 39:38.116
They'll go out first
thing in the morning.

39:38.118 --> 39:39.785
I'm sure he'll be thrilled to get them.

39:39.787 --> 39:42.254
And you'll be happy to hear
he's able to have visitors now,

39:42.256 --> 39:43.522
so if you would like to see him...

39:43.524 --> 39:44.956
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.992
We're all on his approved visitor list,

39:46.994 --> 39:48.860
but you need to schedule
an appointment first.

39:48.862 --> 39:49.995
You can't just pop in.

39:49.997 --> 39:51.463
No. No pop-ins. Um, uh, I can't wait

39:51.465 --> 39:54.566
to see the boy wonder with
my own nearsighted eyes. Oh!

40:03.844 --> 40:06.945
Pawn to Queen's bishop 4.

40:09.316 --> 40:11.616
We'll get you a board.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.785
That's ok, I can see it.

40:13.787 --> 40:15.320
You're gonna need a lot more

40:15.322 --> 40:17.389
than one book at a time, aren't you?

40:17.391 --> 40:18.390
It'd be nice.

40:18.392 --> 40:21.008
I'll hook you up.

40:21.228 --> 40:22.761
I might even be able to get you a job.

40:22.763 --> 40:24.496
I heard they're looking
for somebody in the laundry.

40:24.498 --> 40:25.964
It helps pass the time.

40:25.966 --> 40:26.965
Thank you, Calvin.

40:26.967 --> 40:28.433
Tell me something.

40:28.435 --> 40:30.602
Is old man Foster still
running the firing range

40:30.604 --> 40:32.070
- at the academy?
- Yeah, he's still there.

40:32.072 --> 40:35.173
I swear, he was like 90
when I went through training.

40:35.175 --> 40:38.210
He looks exactly the same.

40:40.547 --> 40:42.214
How do you do it?

40:42.216 --> 40:43.215
Do what?

40:43.217 --> 40:45.550
Survive in here.

40:45.552 --> 40:47.686
First rule is to accept
that no one is safe.

40:47.688 --> 40:49.154
You seem to be.

40:49.156 --> 40:51.022
Last night those guys
could have turned on you,

40:51.024 --> 40:53.458
but instead they listened. Why?

40:53.460 --> 40:56.661
It's all about respect and alliances.

40:56.663 --> 40:59.231
A favor now gets you a favor later.

40:59.233 --> 41:02.567
Like, uh, like moving an
inmate into a particular cell?

41:02.569 --> 41:03.735
Something like that. And don't forget,

41:03.737 --> 41:05.804
once you play the
game as long as I have,

41:05.806 --> 41:07.505
you get good at it.

41:07.507 --> 41:10.775
Pawn to King's knight 6.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.554
That guard Wilkins is threatening

41:22.556 --> 41:24.823
to tell everyone that I'm on the job.

41:24.825 --> 41:27.158
That wouldn't be too good for you.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.394
I don't get it. Everybody
knows you're a fed.

41:29.396 --> 41:32.030
Yeah, but here's the difference.

41:32.032 --> 41:33.798
You say you didn't kill that doctor.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.033
I didn't.

41:35.035 --> 41:37.335
Ok. But everybody
knows I killed that C.I.

41:37.337 --> 41:38.470
I admit it.

41:38.472 --> 41:40.405
That gets me respect in here

41:40.407 --> 41:42.073
because I killed an informant.

41:42.075 --> 41:44.576
A rat, snitch. Lowest of the low.

41:44.578 --> 41:46.278
Do what you gotta do, Reid,

41:46.280 --> 41:47.913
but the sooner you stop fighting it,

41:47.915 --> 41:50.315
the better off you'll be.

41:52.252 --> 41:54.819
Your move.

41:54.821 --> 41:58.590
“One of the many
lessons that one learns in prison

41:58.592 --> 42:00.926
“is that things are what they are

42:00.928 --> 42:03.161
and will be what they will be.”

42:03.163 --> 42:04.796
