WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:09.550
Hey, out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

00:12.387 --> 00:14.138
Probably Monica and Chandler.

00:16.641 --> 00:20.394
Hi, could I have
a pack of Newport Lights?

00:20.562 --> 00:23.856
Oh, um, uh, we don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.983
That'd be great. Thanks.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.528
Oh, my God.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.531
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.702
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Green?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.248
Melissa. Hey.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.335
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.754
What's up with you?

00:48.173 --> 00:50.716
Why don't I tell you over here?

00:51.634 --> 00:55.095
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.305
Oh.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.098
Poor Ray-Ray.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.934
Oh, no, no. It's... It's good.
It's all good.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.063
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

01:04.230 --> 01:08.275
I will not. Heh, heh. I'm the
divisional head of men's sportswear.

01:08.443 --> 01:12.196
Oh, shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

01:12.363 --> 01:14.823
- Oh, please. Ha.
- Are you?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.575
No.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.829
Listen, we have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:20.997 --> 01:24.708
- Oh, tomorrow. I don't know. Um...
- You're having dinner with me.

01:24.876 --> 01:25.918
Shut up.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.547
I've gotta go.
This has been so great, Ray-Ray.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.799
Oh, there you are.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.469
Um, so listen, just call me.
Here's my card.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.720
Oh, wow, thanks.

01:36.888 --> 01:40.265
- Oh, you're in real estate?
- Oh, no, heh, that's an old card.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.811
Um, I got out of that to do something
where I could...

01:44.062 --> 01:46.855
...help people and make a difference.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.649
Wow. What do you do now?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.901
I'm a party planner.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.530
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

01:55.406 --> 01:58.867
Hey guys, look who's back.
It's Ray-Ray.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.788
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.833
She seems really, really fun!

02:06.501 --> 02:10.253
She's actually very sweet,
and we used to be very close.

02:10.420 --> 02:14.758
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you?

02:14.926 --> 02:17.719
Who you what? Who you what?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.806
- Yes.
- Wow!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.517
Wow... Wow, what? Who you what?

02:23.852 --> 02:25.978
Oh, it's not a big deal.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.396
They were lovers.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.273
- What?
- What?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.233
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.237
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

02:35.405 --> 02:40.159
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

02:40.326 --> 02:41.869
...kissing for a bit.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.329
So that's two of my wives.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.628
Okay, so this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

03:32.795 --> 03:37.216
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.009
Oh, wow!

03:39.177 --> 03:42.846
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

03:43.014 --> 03:44.723
...talking to the cute bartender.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.230
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.192
Okay, the red ones are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.278
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

03:58.446 --> 04:01.448
Heh, Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.741
Certainly not a close one.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.329
- Hello.
- Hey.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.417
Hey, Rach.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.879
Stop picturing it!

04:19.300 --> 04:23.428
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.057
Wow.
They all look like they're having fun.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.101
So where are my parents gonna be?

04:29.394 --> 04:30.435
Oh.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.730
Well, if this is the wedding hall,
then, um...

04:33.898 --> 04:37.776
...your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

04:37.944 --> 04:42.114
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

04:42.282 --> 04:44.783
Why would they think they're invited?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.577
You got me. I don't...

04:47.745 --> 04:50.956
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.209
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's parents are coming.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.837
Ross' parents are coming.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.840
Ross' parents are my parents.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.718
Well, see, parents are coming.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.056
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.641
Well, this is just sad.

05:11.602 --> 05:16.231
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.900
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.653
That is not a problem.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.157
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Oh, get out of here!

05:29.996 --> 05:34.583
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

05:34.751 --> 05:39.421
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.716
Uh, well,
thanks a lot for hooking me up.

05:42.884 --> 05:47.304
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.809
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.062
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.192
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.988
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.991
- You mean, like, for award shows?
- Some of them.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.161
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling, uh...

06:11.329 --> 06:13.747
..."Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"

06:15.333 --> 06:18.418
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

06:18.586 --> 06:20.003
...and a little less E!

06:22.340 --> 06:23.799
Okay. Who wore those?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.217
Uh...

06:25.385 --> 06:28.929
- Well, uh, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.932
This one is, uh, Paul O'Neil.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.601
Who's that?

06:35.686 --> 06:39.856
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

06:40.024 --> 06:43.318
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.281
Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.491
- Pierce Brosnan?
- Uh-huh.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.951
Are you serious?

06:51.202 --> 06:52.244
007?

06:52.412 --> 06:57.624
This is James Bond's tux? Oh, I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.418
Ha, ha. It's a pretty cool tux.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.754
Ah, it's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

07:04.549 --> 07:08.885
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.806
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.685
Would Monica let me wear this?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.860
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.236
I like our way.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.405
- Ah!
- Hey, hey!

07:28.573 --> 07:30.115
Chess!

07:32.785 --> 07:34.703
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.622
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.835
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

07:42.003 --> 07:44.212
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

07:44.380 --> 07:48.508
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.260
Ooh, and maybe a hat.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.679
- Huh. Does Monica know about this?
- No.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.557
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

07:57.768 --> 08:00.228
Hey, Rach,
you want to go to a movie tonight?

08:00.396 --> 08:02.689
Oh, I can't.
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.024
Can I come?

08:05.776 --> 08:08.945
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.073
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

08:12.241 --> 08:14.910
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

08:15.077 --> 08:17.245
- Joey's.
- Okay.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.663
Okay, come on.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.415
I had this college friend...

08:20.666 --> 08:24.586
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

08:24.837 --> 08:28.465
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.843
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.097
- It did.
- Sure.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.602
Hey, heh. It happened.

08:42.605 --> 08:46.608
Yeah, it was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

08:46.776 --> 08:49.110
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.448
And we ended up kissing.
For several minutes.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.952
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.581
- Why are you taking this away from me?
- Ugh.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.459
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

09:04.627 --> 09:08.213
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

09:14.720 --> 09:20.016
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

09:20.184 --> 09:24.896
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're... You know, so...

09:25.064 --> 09:26.940
...vanilla.

09:27.108 --> 09:32.028
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.740
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.200
To Ross.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.412
If you don't believe me...

09:40.580 --> 09:43.957
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.043
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.171
You should get inside my head.

09:54.927 --> 09:55.969
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.846
Guess what I got for your wedding?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.557
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

10:01.851 --> 10:05.729
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.772
Batman's tux!

10:08.441 --> 10:09.774
- What?
- That's right.

10:09.942 --> 10:14.988
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

10:15.239 --> 10:17.699
...that Batman film he was in.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.660
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.495
- James Bond's tux.
- So?

10:22.663 --> 10:26.416
If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.002
You need something to
to make it special?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.671
Hello! You have
the most special thing of all.

10:31.839 --> 10:35.300
You are marrying the woman you love.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.515
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

10:42.767 --> 10:46.978
"Pretty please?" Not very, uh, 007.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.358
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

10:51.525 --> 10:56.112
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.993
- Hey.
- Hey. Okay, good. You're here.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.495
All right, I figured it out.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.997
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

11:06.165 --> 11:08.833
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.003
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

11:12.171 --> 11:14.255
Yeah. They're not coming.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.967
What?

11:18.135 --> 11:20.637
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.014
They feel unwanted.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.352
That's too bad. It's true. But too bad.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.522
- If you could just call my mom.
- Oh, Joey.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.816
Come on. Just let her know
you want them there.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.444
Let's not forget this is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.654
No, she hasn't.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.657
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

11:40.825 --> 11:42.367
What am I gonna say?

11:42.618 --> 11:47.205
Just tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, no, no, blame it on the post office.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.209
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.837
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

11:57.049 --> 12:02.053
Hello? Yeah, hi. Uh, Mrs. Tribbiani?
Hi, this is Monica Geller.

12:02.221 --> 12:06.641
I'm just calling to say that I really
hope you can make the wedding.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.145
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

12:10.312 --> 12:14.649
Um, I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.445
Tell me about it.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.824
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.244
What are they, Irish?

12:32.835 --> 12:37.922
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.092
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

12:41.260 --> 12:45.555
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.307
- Oh, well.
- No.

12:47.475 --> 12:52.937
- Ah. He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- Oh! Oh, that's great.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.147
Mm-hm.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.566
- Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.779
Yes. I was a, um,
Thigh Mega Tampon.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.657
What one?

13:04.825 --> 13:08.161
Yeah, we were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

13:08.412 --> 13:11.164
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.373
Ugh.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.251
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.378
Hmm. Mm-hm. Ugh.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.800
Anyway...

13:22.134 --> 13:25.303
Speaking of drinking too much,
I was, uh, telling Phoebe...

13:25.471 --> 13:30.141
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.060
What?

13:32.228 --> 13:37.649
Remember we... Come on, we had
sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.944
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

13:41.195 --> 13:42.695
...and we made out.

13:44.114 --> 13:48.243
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.119
Really?

13:56.710 --> 13:59.003
Ross is Batman.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.676
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

14:05.761 --> 14:10.098
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.059
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

14:13.310 --> 14:18.273
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.527
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

14:24.488 --> 14:29.826
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Heh. Batman has Robin.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.541
We get ESPN, right?

14:39.378 --> 14:44.591
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a nice martini?

14:44.758 --> 14:46.718
Actually I don't like martinis.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.929
- A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw?
- Ooh, yum.

14:52.808 --> 14:53.892
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.019
I know the invitation says 6:00...

14:56.186 --> 15:00.231
...but does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

15:00.399 --> 15:01.900
The show?

15:03.903 --> 15:07.447
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.950
But weddings start a little late, right?

15:11.118 --> 15:13.828
Have you ever
been to one of my weddings?

15:14.997 --> 15:18.207
Ah, well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

15:18.459 --> 15:20.710
...and I want my parents to see me.

15:20.961 --> 15:25.590
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.800
The wedding starts at 6.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.470
Okay. I totally hear you.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.431
Ooh! How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.600
Heh. You'll "vamp"?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.728
Yeah, yeah, like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

15:38.938 --> 15:43.149
In Joey Tribbiani, you get
a minister and an entertainer.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.776
I'm a "ministainer."

15:44.944 --> 15:46.819
All right?

15:46.987 --> 15:50.031
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.407
Huh?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.410
How can you not remember us kissing?

15:54.578 --> 15:57.997
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.248
Wha...

16:00.209 --> 16:05.046
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.548
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.218
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.180
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

16:14.348 --> 16:17.892
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

16:19.186 --> 16:23.940
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.568
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.405
No.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.032
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

16:33.283 --> 16:37.203
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.415
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.291
- But she didn't.
- I know.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.338
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.715
You carry that around?

16:48.882 --> 16:49.924
Yes.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.052
I find it to be something
of a conversation piece.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.306
- Between you and?
- Gunther.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.809
Hey, hey. Why don't we put them on?

17:00.019 --> 17:03.062
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.732
I would, but my pants
are a little tight.

17:05.898 --> 17:10.903
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

17:11.070 --> 17:15.782
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

17:15.951 --> 17:20.079
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

17:22.082 --> 17:23.290
Let me try it on.

17:24.376 --> 17:28.588
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.592
Okay.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.305
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

17:40.100 --> 17:41.476
- What's this?
- Huh?

17:41.643 --> 17:44.562
An invitation to
the At First Sight premiere?

17:44.730 --> 17:45.855
Oh, my God.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.815
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.

17:47.983 --> 17:52.320
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.906
Let me see that.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.867
Oh, man.

17:58.035 --> 18:01.746
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.291
Hey.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.210
Uh, can I talk to you guys
for a second?

18:07.377 --> 18:09.754
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.298
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

18:12.466 --> 18:16.886
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.642
No. I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.353
They're so happy
to get to be a part of your special day.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.687
Oh.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.649
Well, your welcome.
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.362
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

18:36.865 --> 18:37.949
Huh?

18:38.659 --> 18:42.245
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

18:42.496 --> 18:44.956
...is for party time.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.715
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.759
Hey, it was great meeting you.

18:57.010 --> 19:01.013
And, uh, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because, uh...

19:01.223 --> 19:02.932
...you know, you've gotten weird.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.853
Take care, you guys.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.480
Wha... Wait a minute. Okay, look.

19:09.731 --> 19:13.985
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.279
I won't let you take it away from me.

19:16.446 --> 19:19.699
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...

19:27.207 --> 19:31.377
Oh, my God. You love me.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.298
- What?
- Of course I remember our kiss.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.717
I think about it all the time.

19:37.926 --> 19:41.429
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together, I...

19:43.515 --> 19:47.643
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.151
Aw! Look who's being suddenly shy.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.821
You have to feel what I feel.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.699
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.077
I'm just a good kisser.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.705
Shut up.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.708
I'm sorry.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.418
Oh.

20:13.837 --> 20:17.340
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.760
I'm obviously kidding.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.971
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

20:24.139 --> 20:27.642
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

20:29.269 --> 20:33.439
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.734
Anyway, I gotta go.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.153
A kiss goodbye?

20:39.404 --> 20:40.947
No? Okay.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.207
Wow!

20:51.833 --> 20:55.711
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...

21:02.052 --> 21:03.261
What the hell was that?

21:03.428 --> 21:05.972
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.600
- And?
- I've had better.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.776
I found one that fits.

21:19.027 --> 21:23.864
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.869
Aw! Look at you, all handsome.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.539
- Whose is it?
- Oh, does it matter?

21:31.790 --> 21:35.126
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.590
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.052
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

21:45.721 --> 21:46.971
Diane Keaton.
