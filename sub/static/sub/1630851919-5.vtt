WEBVTT

00:48.791 --> 00:50.791
-Hmm.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.208
That was quite some shooting, Kiramman.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.166
Did my parents pay you to let me win?

01:48.750 --> 01:51.625
Hmm… That's a serious accusation.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.041
You held your shot, I saw you.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.583
The trophy is yours. You earned it.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.083
You haven't answered my question.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.041
No, your parents didn't pay me.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.875
I just thought you deserved it.

02:10.416 --> 02:12.000
I'm an enforcer.

02:12.541 --> 02:16.875
For me, knowing how to handle this weapon
means being able to protect people.

02:17.541 --> 02:21.375
To be of service to the city.
And that's trophy enough.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.208
Begs the question, young Kiramman.
What are you shooting for?

02:36.125 --> 02:37.583
I took a look at your file.

02:38.166 --> 02:42.125
There's no record of you or your crimes.
What are you here for?

02:42.208 --> 02:43.708
My sunny personality.

02:44.916 --> 02:47.208
You attacked an inmate. Why?

02:47.791 --> 02:48.625
Why not?

02:49.125 --> 02:52.000
He was a witness
in an ongoing investigation.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.583
Hmm, bummer.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.333
This was a waste of time.

02:56.416 --> 02:57.333
Couldn't have put it better.

02:57.416 --> 03:00.625
Hey, give Silco a kiss
on that winning eye of his, will you?

03:03.666 --> 03:05.666
Silco? The industrialist?

03:06.166 --> 03:07.833
Okay, this is getting old.

03:07.916 --> 03:10.250
Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick
the shit out of me,

03:10.333 --> 03:11.750
so I can get on with my night?

03:19.125 --> 03:20.666
Does this mean anything to you?

03:26.500 --> 03:27.958
-
-Where did you get this?

03:30.416 --> 03:34.583
-My question first. He worked for Silco?
-Uh, they all do.

03:34.666 --> 03:36.916
How can anyone not know that?
Where did you find this?

03:37.541 --> 03:40.416
There was an attack. This is evidence.

03:40.916 --> 03:44.375
I need proof if I'm to believe
what you're saying about Silco.

03:45.375 --> 03:48.958
I could get it for you.
Just not from in here.

03:51.041 --> 03:54.000
In what mad world
would I trust someone like you?

03:54.083 --> 03:55.666
Someone like me?

03:55.750 --> 03:59.916
You enforcers are all the same.
Just asshole criminals in fancy uniforms.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.791
You know what? Find Silco yourself.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.250
I will, thank you.

04:03.333 --> 04:06.666
Hmm… Undercity's gonna eat you alive.

04:13.083 --> 04:16.625
I've got orders from Councilor Talis,
concerning Inmate 516.

04:16.708 --> 04:19.333
Not cooperative, huh?

04:20.041 --> 04:22.833
You, uh, you want us
to have a chat with her?

04:23.708 --> 04:25.291
-No.
-Oh.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.416
It's for her release.

04:27.916 --> 04:30.833
Huh. Since when's he a Councilor?

04:30.916 --> 04:32.541
Since today.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.291
How many chats have you had with her?

04:41.083 --> 04:44.166
You know, I never even thought to count.

05:30.791 --> 05:33.916


05:34.000 --> 05:39.875


06:17.458 --> 06:20.166
These brave Enforcers
sacrificed their lives

06:20.250 --> 06:22.416
to defend the values of our great city.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
To some, they are mothers…

06:27.875 --> 06:30.875
fathers, sons…

06:34.250 --> 06:35.291
daughters…

06:37.250 --> 06:40.791
but to all, they are heroes.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.833
Who was this, Daddy?

07:15.625 --> 07:16.583
A good woman.

07:19.833 --> 07:25.666
You said you could control her.
I lost six officers. Six!

07:27.333 --> 07:31.000
She pushed it too far this time.
The Council's up in arms.

07:31.083 --> 07:35.083
I can't make this go away for you
unless you give me something to work with.

07:35.833 --> 07:38.583
-Arresting her would be doing you a favor.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.000
I don't need favors.

07:40.666 --> 07:42.875
I need you to do your job.

07:46.791 --> 07:49.583
The Firelights have been a thorn
in both our sides.

07:49.666 --> 07:53.541
They ambushed my shipment at the Hexgates
on the same day as the attack.

07:54.083 --> 07:57.666
It seems to me
the Council has its culprit.

07:58.666 --> 07:59.958
Oh, that's tidy for you.

08:00.583 --> 08:03.041
What if I'm not interested
in playing along?

08:04.375 --> 08:08.500
We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus.
Sheriff.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.541
And there is more yet to achieve.

08:12.958 --> 08:15.000
I hope you can remain a part of it.

08:21.083 --> 08:25.833
For their families.
From an anonymous, concerned citizen.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.541
Yesterday's smuggling fiasco was nothing.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.541
These manifests are full of discrepancies,
dating back months.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.625
This is a poor use of our time.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.500
I'm a Councilor now, Viktor.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.958
It's my responsibility to make sure
the Hexgates are safe and protected.

08:55.041 --> 09:00.041
What about our pledge to improve lives,
for those in need? For the undercity?

09:01.708 --> 09:05.000
Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce
our other projects in my speech.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.208
-Soon, we can do everything we--
-Soon?

09:07.291 --> 09:10.541
There are people
who need our help now, Jayce.

09:11.875 --> 09:13.250
You wanted to see me?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.375
Have your people ever reviewed these logs?

09:15.958 --> 09:17.833
-Mr. Talis, I assure you--
-Councilor.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.500
And the only assurance I need is that

09:19.583 --> 09:22.041
you will search and seize
any unauthorized merchandise.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.708
I've made a list
of suspicious transactions.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.708
All due respect, Councilor,

09:26.791 --> 09:28.541
-today's your first day--
-Second.

09:28.625 --> 09:29.666
Right.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.083
You sure you don't want to confer
with the other Councilors before--

09:32.166 --> 09:34.416
This corruption runs deep, Sheriff.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.166
I intend to root it out.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.875
Have you made any progress
with the stolen Gemstone?

09:39.958 --> 09:44.083
-Yes. Chief suspect is an undercity gang.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.708
They call themselves the Firelights.

09:45.791 --> 09:47.250
They operate like phantoms,

09:47.333 --> 09:50.125
doing hit-and-runs on civilians
and disappearing into the night.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.708
-How soon till we track them down?
-I've got my best officers on it.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.250
Viktor? You all right?

10:06.166 --> 10:10.166
A… a headache. I just…
I need to get to the lab.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.500
Boring…

10:20.125 --> 10:23.875
Boring. Wow. Super boring…

10:26.750 --> 10:28.166
Here we go!

10:29.333 --> 10:31.541
It's all about these runes.

10:31.625 --> 10:36.791
They form some kind of math-y,
magic-y gateway.

10:37.416 --> 10:43.000
To the realm of heebie-jeebies.
And this… Turns it on.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.541
So… here goes.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.708
No!

11:19.291 --> 11:22.541
No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.666
I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.

11:34.250 --> 11:37.041
That could be a good way
to get a lay of the land.

11:38.416 --> 11:39.500
Too risky.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.625
What…

12:55.083 --> 12:57.250
-Nice jacket.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.333
Welcome to the Lanes.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.791
You almost got me killed.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.958
My little sister could do that
when she was seven.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.458
All us fissure folk can.
Don't you want to blend in?

13:30.791 --> 13:32.166
You had a vision?

13:32.250 --> 13:34.583
What if we've been looking at it
backwards?

13:34.666 --> 13:37.541
We've been trying to discover
runes that invoke specific effects

13:37.625 --> 13:40.083
and then molding them
to a useful function.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.750
Tools, as you like to put it. But, but…

13:42.833 --> 13:47.625
If the legends are true,
mages aren't bound to single functions.

13:47.708 --> 13:50.416
It's said the Arcane speaks through them.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.250
I'm still not following.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.750
They think. They adapt.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.458
You think Hextech can… learn?

14:03.791 --> 14:05.250
Are you sure this is safe?

14:05.333 --> 14:06.666
Of course not.

14:22.750 --> 14:25.166
Oh, Jericho! Have I missed these.

14:29.541 --> 14:30.375
Hmm?

14:31.333 --> 14:32.541
No. Thank you.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.333
You're missing out.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.458
Are you going to question him?

14:36.541 --> 14:38.375
About what? The meat?

14:39.916 --> 14:41.583
Definitely not above board.

14:41.666 --> 14:45.041
Silco. His connections?
Isn't that why we're here?

14:45.125 --> 14:48.041
We're here because I'm hungry.
Do you know what prison food is like?

14:48.125 --> 14:49.708
No, of course, you don't.

14:50.500 --> 14:54.708
Unbelievable. I didn't break you
out of jail to eat… slop.

14:54.791 --> 14:58.791
I knew this was a terrible idea.
You don't actually know anything, do you?

14:59.291 --> 15:01.041
Mm. Better than I remember.

15:13.708 --> 15:14.916
Hmm.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.208
I haven't been here in years.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.250
Since my parents brought me
for the winter fest.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.708
We're not here for the performance.
Your House is in trouble.

15:32.833 --> 15:35.833
That merchant formerly enjoyed
certain leniencies

15:35.916 --> 15:40.708
with regard to her trade in exchange
for her generous Academy patronage.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.458
By leniencies you mean corruption?

15:43.541 --> 15:45.666
Hmm, Amara's harmless.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.083
Oh, look at those two stooges.

15:48.166 --> 15:51.250
Councilors Hoskel and Salo.
Don't they hate each other?

15:51.333 --> 15:55.000
Hmm. But they share a taste
for the finer Noxian spirits,

15:55.083 --> 15:57.916
technically an illegal import.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.958
I tightened our security.

16:00.041 --> 16:03.541
And in so doing,
put a target on your back.

16:04.208 --> 16:08.666
There are those who covet your power
over the wealth the Hexgates afford.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.708
And would take any opportunity
to seize it from you.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.166
You've just made yourself
everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.000
<i>Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?</i>

16:50.083 --> 16:52.000
<i>You worried Powder's gonna beat you again.</i>

17:39.375 --> 17:40.458
<i>Vander.</i>

17:41.333 --> 17:43.166
<i>Because you're a jinx!</i>

17:44.916 --> 17:46.541
<i>What makes you different makes you strong.</i>

18:39.791 --> 18:41.250
Hmm.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.500
Well, that place does look like
it has bodies buried in the basement.

18:48.041 --> 18:49.083
You don't know anything.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.875
I can't compromise the safety
of the Hexgates for collateral.

19:04.958 --> 19:09.416
No one's asking you to.
These are simply favors amongst friends.

19:09.500 --> 19:13.125
I never wanted anything to do
with politics. You pushed this on me.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.500
You're a symbol of the future now, Jayce,
whether you like it or not.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.916
With that comes the potential
to shape your own destiny.

19:20.708 --> 19:25.541
The Council assumes you'll fail.
Time to prove them all wrong. Once again.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.958
Welcome, Amara. How's little Rohan?

19:31.041 --> 19:34.375
Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.875
He's just as precocious as ever.

19:40.041 --> 19:44.666
I had quite a shock this morning.
Enforcers banging on my door.

19:44.750 --> 19:48.791
Oh, I hope you'll understand,
Jayce had to make a show of safety.

19:48.875 --> 19:52.458
But he's here now to negotiate
all his deals personally.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.041
Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate
former trade privileges

19:56.125 --> 19:58.041
to those who share his vision.

19:58.125 --> 19:59.791
Can we count you amongst them?

19:59.875 --> 20:03.625
Councilor Bolbok seems to think other
arrangements would be more profitable.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.458
The man's a fool.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.708
With him, you'd be investing in the past.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.583
With us, you'd be investing in the future.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.291
You know, Councilor Medarda's right.
The Hexgates are only the beginning.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.750
In fact, we're currently looking
for new partners in our Hextech research,

20:20.833 --> 20:22.833
and as a supporter of House Talis,

20:22.916 --> 20:25.875
you'd be the first in line
to any of our advancements.

20:31.166 --> 20:34.333
How can I say no
to such an auspicious offer?

20:37.125 --> 20:38.625
Hextech partners?

20:39.125 --> 20:40.250
Has a nice ring, doesn't it?

20:40.833 --> 20:44.333
Mm. Your audience awaits, Councilor.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.416
He's been quite the investment.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.541
Indeed. Better than expected.

21:43.833 --> 21:46.041
The one place all the secrets are spilled.

22:04.375 --> 22:06.083
Oh.

22:07.250 --> 22:10.041
How exactly do you propose
we go about this?

22:10.125 --> 22:12.750
-Let 'em think you work here.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.625
Excuse me?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.291
I will not.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.166
You know what your problem is?

22:18.250 --> 22:19.791
Please. Tell me.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.208
You expect everyone
to give you what you want.

22:22.291 --> 22:23.875
If you really want people to talk to you,

22:23.958 --> 22:27.083
you have to let them think
you have what they want.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.750
And what do I have?

22:31.250 --> 22:32.875
You're hot, cupcake.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.291
So what'll it be, man or woman?

22:37.375 --> 22:39.666
-Um…

22:40.875 --> 22:41.708
Hi.

22:41.791 --> 22:44.791
I'm Pim. What's your name?

22:44.875 --> 22:50.791
Matilda. But you can call her
whatever you want.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.375
Ah, yes. Matilda.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.666
My parents named me Matilda.

22:57.750 --> 23:01.875
After my great-grandmother Matilda,
the, uh…

23:05.750 --> 23:06.791
Would you believe it?

23:14.500 --> 23:17.750
Sheriff, what a lovely surprise.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.916
The Hextech wonder boy
is on the Council now,

23:21.666 --> 23:23.583
and he's asking questions.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.291
It's only a matter of time
before he finds the truth.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.791
What is truth, but a survivor's story?

23:29.875 --> 23:32.666
If I'm discovered, we're both finished.

23:33.541 --> 23:36.708
Good thing you've located proof
of the Firelights' involvement.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.333
This has gone too far.

23:47.458 --> 23:50.708
Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero?

23:51.208 --> 23:55.708
One final act to make you the martyr
you've always seen yourself as?

24:04.125 --> 24:06.083
Then what are you waiting for?

24:19.083 --> 24:21.083
-Ah, he's faltering.

24:21.166 --> 24:23.541
You need to weaponize the Hextech soon.

24:24.041 --> 24:27.875
Once we've cracked their prize,
topside will have no power over us.

24:28.458 --> 24:32.375
I can't do it.
Just… give it to the doctor.

24:32.458 --> 24:35.375
You're the only one
I can trust with this, Jinx.

24:36.166 --> 24:39.458
I keep… seeing them. That day.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.583
Fear haunts us all, child.

24:48.625 --> 24:52.666
Sweetheart, I was real sad
to hear about Vander.

24:52.750 --> 24:56.166
And the kids. Just terrible.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.916
By the looks of it, no one down here
lifted a finger to stop Silco.

24:59.458 --> 25:04.666
A few tried but Silco's got the muscle…
and the money.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.208
He took over the Last Drop.

25:06.875 --> 25:07.708
I saw.

25:08.416 --> 25:11.083
Things have changed
without Vander looking out for us.

25:11.791 --> 25:15.458
Have you heard anything about Powder?
I think Silco has her.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.916
I have to find her.

25:20.625 --> 25:22.750
Silco's number two's a regular.

25:23.250 --> 25:25.458
I can have Miguel tell you
where to find her.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.541
I owe you.

25:30.583 --> 25:31.625
It's nothing.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.875
I've only ever imagined the gardens…

25:37.958 --> 25:39.750
This is all I've seen.

25:53.708 --> 25:54.666
You did well today.

25:55.541 --> 25:56.708
I had a good teacher.

25:57.666 --> 26:00.666
It's only a matter of time
before those old fools on the Council

26:00.750 --> 26:02.666
-officially accept your research.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.500
My father put hammers
in the hands of the people,

26:06.583 --> 26:08.750
and they built this magnificent city.

26:09.416 --> 26:12.916
Imagine the wonders they could create
if we put magic in their hands.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.666
The world will never be the same.

26:17.791 --> 26:19.958
The Medardas usually only take
from the world.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.625
We're not often in the position
to give anything back.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.083
I couldn't have done it without you.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.166
Hmm.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.333
It's beautiful.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.916
I can't figure out why it's not working.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.041
You will.

27:03.333 --> 27:07.250
Are you headed home soon?
I thought we could walk together.

27:07.791 --> 27:10.666
I'm, uh, probably going
to sleep here tonight.

27:11.166 --> 27:14.750
Again? You know
there's always tomorrow, right?

27:15.541 --> 27:17.083
Good night, Miss Young.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.083
Mm.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.833
I almost drowned in these waters.

29:04.916 --> 29:07.541
You told me a million times.

29:07.625 --> 29:10.541
Vander wasn't the man
you thought he was.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.125
Right, he was like a brother to you,

29:13.208 --> 29:16.625
and he turned his back
and blah, blah, blah.

29:16.708 --> 29:18.250
Did I miss anything?

29:18.333 --> 29:21.708
I've got a new one for you.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.708
That day, I let a weak man die.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.625
And another was reborn.

29:43.875 --> 29:49.791
Betrayal, that pain that feels like
it'll eat you from the inside out,

29:49.875 --> 29:54.625
can either break you or forge you
into something greater.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.166
You need to let Powder die.

29:58.958 --> 30:01.666
So the fear of pain
will no longer control you.

30:04.291 --> 30:08.208
You're strong now.
Just like you were always meant to be.

30:09.583 --> 30:10.708
Jinx is perfect.

31:55.958 --> 31:56.875
Jayce?

31:57.583 --> 32:03.000
Viktor, the doctors, um, they said you're…

32:06.416 --> 32:09.333
How much time do I have?

32:15.166 --> 32:16.583
Rotten luck, boys!

32:28.083 --> 32:29.125
Vi?

32:33.291 --> 32:34.583
You filthy traitor.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.958
Vander had his chance.

33:03.666 --> 33:05.375
I see you never learned patience.

34:27.625 --> 34:30.708
Where's my sister?
Where's he keeping her?

34:30.791 --> 34:33.583
Keeping her? You mean Jinx?

34:35.291 --> 34:36.458
She works for him.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.333
She's like his daughter.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.000
I'll give her your regards.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.166
Why did you let her go?

35:31.250 --> 35:32.833
Do you ever say "thank you?"

35:32.916 --> 35:35.500
-He's gonna know we're here now.
-Whose fault is that?

35:41.625 --> 35:42.750
You're an all-right shot.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.125
I'm an excellent shot.

35:45.208 --> 35:47.916
You gonna help me out, cupcake?

35:48.500 --> 35:52.333
Stop calling me that. My name is Caitlyn.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.166
But you're so sweet.

35:54.666 --> 35:55.875
Like a cupcake.

35:55.958 --> 35:58.416
Shut up.

36:21.208 --> 36:22.666
You're making a mess.

36:42.375 --> 36:43.500
The sister.

36:44.083 --> 36:45.291
She's back.

36:47.958 --> 36:49.041
From the dead?
