00:07.240 --> 00:09.766
From <i>Bloomberg West</i> in San Francisco,
I'm Emily Chang.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.527
General Keith Alexander is here
to tackle tech's role in counter-terrorism,

00:13.600 --> 00:16.364
but first, a quick glimpse
with Richard Hendricks,

00:16.480 --> 00:20.201
founder and CEO of the hot, new
compression platform Pied Piper,

00:20.280 --> 00:22.851
and Erlich Bachman, Chief Visionary.

00:22.960 --> 00:28.285
Oh, Emily Chang, it is just splendid
to be here with you at historical Pier 3,

00:28.360 --> 00:29.691
with a breathtaking view

00:29.800 --> 00:31.609
of the Embarcadero Center

00:31.680 --> 00:33.364
and the flag of San Francisco.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.601
Now, Richard...

00:34.720 --> 00:38.088
Richard actually
developed this technology in my incubator.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.730
I am listed...

00:39.800 --> 00:44.806
I was originally listed under the white pages
as "Erlich Blachman", with an

00:44.880 --> 00:46.564
a typo that apparently couldn't be changed,

00:46.640 --> 00:49.211
and then Google indexed it,
so I've been dealing with that.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.250
Richard, Pied Piper has taken off like a rocket.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.369
More than 100,000 installs
in just 10 days.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.487
Is that right?

00:59.640 --> 01:00.766
Uh... Uh, yes.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.887
Pretty amazing.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.851
And you have a last-minute invite
to the Vanity Fair summit dinner tonight.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.962
Quite an honor for such a young company.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.565
Richard, maybe
you could comment on this one?

01:09.640 --> 01:13.087
Yeah, we are finally the belles of the balls.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.166
I mean, uh, ball.

01:15.560 --> 01:20.248
Now, some people are
calling you the next Unicorn.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.004
Have you guys thought about that?

01:22.080 --> 01:24.481
You could have a billion-dollar company.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.531
Erlich, you could own 5% of $1 billion.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.920
Uh, ten, actually.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.001
<i>Richard, this is boring.</i>

01:31.080 --> 01:32.241
- Shit.
- No, no, no.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.930
<i>He was an early investor.</i>

01:34.000 --> 01:36.287
<i>Again, it's Erlich Bachman.</i>

01:36.360 --> 01:39.648
<i>If you Google that, it'll say,
"Did you mean Erlich Blachman?"</i>

01:39.720 --> 01:43.884
<i>You can click on that link, it'll give you
the correct results for Erlich Bachman.</i>

01:44.680 --> 01:46.364
<i>Should we take some calls?</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:47.441
<i>We don't do that here.</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:50.604
I just know what I saw, Richard.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.321
No, come on. Look, she's married,
she just had another baby.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.802
If you pushed a little harder,
you could have scored right there on camera.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.644
- You should get her phone number.
- Shut up.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.967
Oh. This is actually,
uh, Jian-Yang pranking me.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.041
I should take it.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.966
Yes, of course I have frog's legs.
Why do you ask?

02:12.040 --> 02:16.011
Are you serious? Have you honestly still
not told him that you sold your shares?

02:16.080 --> 02:17.684
You can't keep lying to him like this.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.364
It's not technically a lie.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.807
My shares don't transfer to Raviga
until the next board meeting.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.281
- Come on, it's been 10 days.
- I know, I know.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.967
But, you know, the TechCrunch thing came up
and then there was the Reddit AMA

02:28.040 --> 02:30.327
and, you know, now this Bloomberg thing.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.811
And besides, let's be honest,

02:31.920 --> 02:34.685
Richard shouldn't be in the public eye
without me along to help.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.007
Did you just see the skeeved-out look
on Emily Chang's face?

02:37.080 --> 02:38.525
I thought she was going to walk off set.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.409
Erlich, you're lying to him,

02:40.480 --> 02:43.290
and you made me a part of it,
so now I'm lying to him, too.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.328
The longer you wait,
the worse this is gonna get.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.687
- All right, fine, fine. I'll tell him.
- When?

02:47.760 --> 02:50.525
After the Vanity Fair thing tonight.
I mean, did you see the guest list?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.011
Monica, throw me a bone here.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.447
Twenty-four hours, then I'm telling him.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.443
- Fine, I'll tell him. I'll tell Richard.
- I'm serious.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.601
- Tell me what?
- I'm not joking...

02:57.680 --> 02:58.681
Um...

02:59.280 --> 03:00.691
it was, uh, Jian-Yang.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.240
He said to tell you that
Phillip McCrevis left word.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.607
Oh. Who's Phillip... Oh.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.926
Richard, we'd better get our asses
in first fucking gear

03:22.000 --> 03:25.004
if we want to make it
to this Verge photoshoot.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.889
Oh, shit. That's today?

03:26.960 --> 03:29.645
Yes, I assume that's why you're still
wearing your Bloomberg makeup.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.123
No. No, I was just... I kind of like the way it...

03:33.440 --> 03:36.091
Uh... Can we just
push this to next week, please?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.367
They don't really do that.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.963
Okay, well, can you go?

03:41.040 --> 03:42.451
Please? I just have a ton of work,

03:42.520 --> 03:46.411
and honestly I would be really happy
if I never had to do any of this ever again

03:46.480 --> 03:48.050
and then you were just
the face of the company.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.043
You know what I mean? Oh, shit.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.043
What time is this Vanity Fair thing?

03:52.120 --> 03:54.521
It's tonight. I figure we're wheels up by 6:00,

03:54.600 --> 03:57.604
then we can check into the hotel,
shit, shave, and shit again.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.523
- Get a cocktail.
- What hotel?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.409
Eavesdropping. Well, if you must know,

04:01.480 --> 04:04.563
we got a suite at the Fairmont,
and they're sending a car.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.251
I think Richard deserves it.
And then I figured tomorrow in the a.m.,

04:07.320 --> 04:09.607
we would sleep in and have a nice brunch.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.047
I don't have time for a brunch.
I have to be back here.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.125
Come on, Eggs Benny, a little spinach tartar,
you'll flirt with the waitress.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.841
Killer. And, uh, we'll have a nice talk.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.771
"Talk"? What about?

04:21.839 --> 04:25.049
You know, things, all sorts of themes.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.808
So tomorrow, you, me, brunch,

04:28.880 --> 04:32.282
and, uh, one word. Frittata.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.729
Hey, fellas, is it me, or is it a bit chilly in here?

04:40.840 --> 04:43.286
What in God's name is that?

04:43.360 --> 04:45.840
What do you think it is? It's a jacket!

04:47.040 --> 04:49.441
Now, I only ordered one as a sample,

04:49.520 --> 04:52.171
but once I have your sizes,
we can all have them.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.005
Why would we all want them?
One is already too many.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.560
I don't mean in the house.
I mean, like, in the world.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.645
Now Gilfoyle, I have you at about a 40 long?
Am I right?

05:01.720 --> 05:03.927
If my mother was naked
and dead in the street,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.651
I would not cover her body with that jacket.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.529
<i>GM.</i>

05:09.880 --> 05:11.120
Jared, now that you're here,

05:11.200 --> 05:13.771
-we need two new tables in the game room.
- Yeah?

05:13.840 --> 05:17.401
Okay. Well, maybe against the doors?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.767
Oh, hold on, there's more.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.208
And you guys give me shit
for a tiny gold chain?

05:27.280 --> 05:31.444
I regret nothing. I'm going to get coffee.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.565
Hey, Brownie, you coming?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.529
I was thinking
we'd hit the Philz on Middlefield.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.206
No, let's drive to the one on Forest Avenue.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.123
It's further from that jacket.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.160
Claude, you're on pager duty
until we get back.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.481
Jared, can I borrow that jacket?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.844
I sense you're doing something ironic with it,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.331
but I'm okay with that,

05:55.440 --> 05:59.809
because however unattractive
this jacket may seem to you,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.003
once you slip it on, everything will change.

06:03.080 --> 06:08.325
It'll shake out its hair and take off its glasses,
and before you know it, you'll be in love.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.247
Jared, it's really fucking ugly.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.247
Consider the tortoise.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.004
As the fable teaches us,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.208
it may appear that he is losing in his race

06:20.280 --> 06:23.762
against his nemesis,
the insolent and cocksure hare.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.523
But appearances can be deceiving.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.762
Gavin, the tortoise. Is it Endframe?

06:29.920 --> 06:32.844
Yes. But there's more.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.083
- The hare is Pied Piper.
-Indeed it is. Someone's read their Aesop.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.810
We've also read the financials, Gavin.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.325
Between Nucleus and EndFrame,

06:39.400 --> 06:42.051
you've burned through
three-quarters of $1 billion,

06:42.120 --> 06:44.043
with virtually nothing to show for it.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.246
Two weeks ago,

06:45.320 --> 06:49.405
on the heels of powering down the entire
Hooli campus for seemingly no reason,

06:49.480 --> 06:52.927
you lost all of EndFrame's senior engineers.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.049
I grant you, we've stumbled on offense of late,

06:56.120 --> 06:58.122
but the best offense is a good defense.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.601
We've taken a page out of Apple's playbook

07:00.680 --> 07:03.889
and are currently "reviewing"
the Pied Piper app for sale

07:03.960 --> 07:07.601
in our Hooli store
at a pace one might call "tortoise-like."

07:07.680 --> 07:09.284
Don't. They hate that.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.928
In any case, I have it on good authority

07:12.000 --> 07:16.927
that it may be some time before Pied Piper
is available on Hooli OS devices.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.690
We're making it available immediately.

07:18.880 --> 07:19.961
Sorry?

07:20.040 --> 07:23.044
You're fighting a war that's already ended,
Gavin. Pied Piper won.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.043
We called this board meeting to inform you

07:25.120 --> 07:28.329
that it's time for Hooli to let go
and move on without you at the wheel.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.200
I'm sorry, without me?
Are you firing me?

07:32.280 --> 07:33.964
Our intention is simply to transition you

07:34.040 --> 07:36.566
into a more appropriate role
within the company,

07:36.640 --> 07:39.371
one with less oversight
of day-to-day operations.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.801
You're putting me on the fucking roof?

07:43.880 --> 07:46.963
You could always choose to move on, Gavin.
Up to you.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.728
I built this company with my bare hands
in my fucking garage.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.609
Where were you when I was doing that?

07:54.720 --> 07:55.801
Gavin?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.240
These animals?

08:11.160 --> 08:12.446
Fuck.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.050
Well, uh, you are certainly more than qualified
to be our new head of PR.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.360
Laurie thinks you're great.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.080
Um, to be honest, we could use the help.

08:22.360 --> 08:26.126
All the media stuff has been pretty
overwhelming, especially lately.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.885
- If Marissa Mayer can do it, so can you.
- Oh.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.927
And you're available immediately?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.684
I am. I do have one question for you guys.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.287
Is everything here cool?

08:40.039 --> 08:42.327
Is it cool?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.164
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm cool.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.730
- Yeah, he is cool.
- Uh-huh.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.124
Clearly, but is there anything you guys
want to tell me about the company?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.361
What, like, uh...

08:52.440 --> 08:54.044
All right, look, this is weird,

08:54.120 --> 08:56.726
but when I was in Laurie's office yesterday,

08:56.800 --> 08:59.246
I saw a piece of paper on her desk.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.721
Well, she can be a bit untidy.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.406
It was a sale of a big block
of Pied Piper stock.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.120
Is someone on the inside

09:06.200 --> 09:08.487
-dumping shares right as you're launching?
- What?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.690
No. No, absolutely not.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.683
'Cause that would be
a pretty severe signaling risk.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.205
I mean, you don't have to be in PR

09:15.280 --> 09:17.169
to know that insiders
only dump stock like that

09:17.240 --> 09:18.651
when they know something is wrong.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.247
The bulk of my compensation here
would be options,

09:21.320 --> 09:22.890
and if those aren't
going to be worth anything...

09:23.440 --> 09:25.841
Yeah. No. No, no, no.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.248
That is not happening, okay?
Nothing is going on here.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.846
- Yeah, except excellence.
- Okay.

09:32.920 --> 09:37.847
Well, you let me know what you want to do
and I'll think about it.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.004
Okay. Oh.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.522
Um, well, thanks for coming.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.605
What the hell was that?

09:50.080 --> 09:52.526
Maybe it was a negotiating tactic?

09:54.360 --> 09:55.441
Monica.

09:56.960 --> 09:57.961
It's Monica.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.724
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.804
I mean, she's the only one
who's bought a jacket.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.929
Jared, she's the only one
who hates the platform.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.601
There's no other explanation for this.
Okay? Monica fucked us.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.122
She pulled down our pants
and fucked us in front of our parents.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.170
Did some...
Richard, did somebody do that to you?

10:17.240 --> 10:18.241
No. No, I don't know why...

10:20.880 --> 10:24.805
Oh, boy, it is chilly.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.808
Good thing I brought this sweet jiz-acket.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.089
Hey, friend? We came here together.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.445
I know what you're doing.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.649
You think you're embarrassing me,

10:38.720 --> 10:41.405
but that's only the secondary effect
of that shitty jacket.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.164
The primary effect is

10:43.560 --> 10:47.804
that you look like a douchebag.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.803
Let me put this in terms you'll understand.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.804
I'm like a suicide bomber of humiliation.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.969
I'm happy to go out
as long as I take you with me.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.408
Your shame is my paradise.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.091
'Sup, ladies?

11:03.240 --> 11:06.289
What you noshing on? Cranberry scone?

11:06.360 --> 11:11.241
My friend Dinesh here
has a little crush on you. He's shy.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.080
I don't know him.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.842
Oh, he plays coy.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.410
I don't know why he's so shy.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.801
Excuse me. I noticed your jacket.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.251
Do you work for Pied Piper?

11:22.280 --> 11:24.408
- Yeah.
- Dude, your app is killin' it.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.209
Everyone I know is installing it.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.442
Do you, seriously?
I just downloaded it last night.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.081
- Yeah?
- Do you mind if we get a picture?

11:31.160 --> 11:33.527
- With me?
- Yeah. Everybody get in.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.045
If you want it.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.565
- Thanks.
- Thanks, bro.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.211
Hey, man, did you remember
to put money in the meter?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.760
Hi, I'm Dinesh. l work at Pied Piper.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.490
Excuse me, do I know you?

11:46.280 --> 11:48.089
Gilfoyle.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.561
He's a fuckin' dick, but I love him, though.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.369
You have me confused with someone else.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.651
My name's clearly Jared, and if you
would excuse us, you were interrupting.

11:56.960 --> 12:00.009
No, he's lying. His name is Gilfoyle.
Show them your driver's license.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.448
Jared asked you nicely to step back,
so step the fuck back.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.887
You're being a dick, and you're cutting in line.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.201
You heard him. You're being a dick.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.560
- Boy, some people.
- What a creep.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.369
Sorry you had to deal with that, Jared.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.408
You and me both, friend.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.682
This is Monica.

12:19.800 --> 12:23.282
Is it? Because apparently everything else
that comes out of your mouth is a lie.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.006
Shit.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.482
Look, Richard, I totally understand
if you're pissed at me,

12:28.600 --> 12:32.002
but please know that I tried as hard as I could
to get him to tell you.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.003
Oh, really? Well, that's not what he said.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.082
Oh, really? What exactly did he say?

12:36.160 --> 12:39.403
He said that he found it
on a piece of paper in Laurie's office.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.087
What? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
Who's the "he" that you're talking about?

12:43.160 --> 12:44.525
You know who. David.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.161
My brother?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.327
What?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.243
Who the fuck... I don't know.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.288
No, David, the fucking PR guy

12:51.360 --> 12:53.362
who's not going to take a job with us
because of what you did.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.206
Richard, I am totally lost.
What exactly do you think I did?

12:57.280 --> 12:58.566
<i>You can play dumb all you want to.</i>

12:58.640 --> 13:01.325
It won't change the one thing
that both you and I know is true.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.129
You dumped your stock.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.649
What? No. I didn't dump
a single share of my Pied Piper stock.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.529
- I swear.
- Well, then who the fuck did?

13:10.280 --> 13:11.964
And make sure that the money reads.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.122
I mean, Pied Piper is a billion-dollar company.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.440
It's not just a unicorn.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.284
All right, let's do some rearing.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.640
There we go.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.564
Now, let's let the horns
sort of look like my dick.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.451
Perfect.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.485
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:25.560 --> 13:26.721
Richard.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.206
Um, can we take a soft five?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.601
I was going to tell you.
That's what tomorrow's brunch was for.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.446
Brunch? You had 10 fucking days
and you didn't say a thing.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.568
Fine. You want to know why I didn't tell you?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.005
Because it's fucking humiliating.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.241
I'm broke, Richard.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.243
Did you hear me? I'm broke.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.204
Erlich Bachman, the name
that used to be synonymous with success,

13:47.280 --> 13:49.442
went broke and was forced to sell.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.841
- I got royally fucked, Richard.
- You got fucked?

13:51.920 --> 13:55.083
You're the one who threw
a million-dollar party.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.162
- Yeah, but it was a great party.
- No one forced you to do that.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.890
Admit it, you fucked yourself.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.924
But I'm not gonna let you fuck my company.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.089
I'm going to have to issue a press release
explaining what you did and why.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.650
No, no, come on. This isn't out.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.530
-It's one PR guy.
- That we know of, Erlich.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.682
How many other people
saw that piece of paper?

14:10.840 --> 14:13.207
How many people has this guy talked to?

14:13.280 --> 14:16.602
This is Silicon Valley.
Rumors spread like light speed here.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.690
How are we gonna get
good people to work for us

14:20.760 --> 14:23.286
if they think something funky
is going on with our stock?

14:23.640 --> 14:26.405
How are we going to scale?
This is gonna kill us.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.051
Richard, do you know what happens
if this goes public?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.202
- I'm Ron Wayne.
- Who?

14:31.280 --> 14:35.604
Ron Wayne, the guy that owned 10% of Apple
and sold it in 1976.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.762
No one in this town
will work with me ever again.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.401
You want me to risk
the entire future of Pied Piper,

14:41.480 --> 14:43.608
everything that I've worked for,

14:43.680 --> 14:48.561
just to protect you from
your own fucking incompetence?

14:48.640 --> 14:52.690
Richard, there's a 3% to 4% chance
that this is going to get out on its own,

14:52.760 --> 14:54.728
but there is 100% chance

14:54.800 --> 14:59.283
that if you issue a press release
no one will ever take me seriously again.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.042
My dignity is in your hands, Richard.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.331
Do with it what you will.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.686
Gavin? Is that you?

15:14.760 --> 15:17.081
Jack Barker. Nice plane.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.650
Yours, too. Where are you headed?

15:18.720 --> 15:21.291
I just needed to take a walk
and clear my head.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.284
There's this great little hiking trail
near my lodge in Jackson Hole.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.086
Get out of here.
I'm on my way up to J Hole myself.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.810
Is that right? I thought you sold.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.723
No, I just never go there.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.321
So how long you going for?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.811
Coming back tomorrow afternoon.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.360
- Me, too.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

15:37.960 --> 15:42.443
Seriously, we need to find a couple hours,
get together, catch up.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.806
I could tell you some war stories.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.046
Well, I'd love that.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.367
I could tell you a few of my own.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.126
- Well, be well.
- You, too.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.043
- Take care, Jack.
- Yeah. See you.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.361
Gavin?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.086
Wait.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.207
Uh, what are we doing here?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.763
I mean, you're on your way to Jackson Hole,
I'm going to Jackson Hole.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.730
You seem like you could use some company.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.843
- You play chess?
- I do. Indeed.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.285
Fantastic.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.807
I tell you, when we get up to altitude
and the Wi-Fi kicks in,

16:13.880 --> 16:17.282
I'm ActionJB62 on Hooli chat.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.725
- Find me.
- I will.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.882
- I'm glad we bumped into each other.
- Me, too.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.362
- Really is a small world.
-It's crazy.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.643
Okay, well, uh, I think it reads well.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.321
And it's all in there.
This will definitely set the record straight.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.880
Then again, you're basically
lighting Erlich on fire.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.406
So what? He fucked the company.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.881
He potentially fucked the company.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.645
Are you kidding me?
Gilfoyle, back me up here.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.881
This is thorny.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.644
How is this even a question for you guys?

16:47.720 --> 16:50.041
Honestly. I mean, it's not like
he's going to be out on the street.

16:50.120 --> 16:54.444
He just sold 10% of a company
that's valued at least $50 million,

16:54.520 --> 16:57.171
and now, suddenly,
we're giving him the benefit of the doubt?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.927
Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you,
Gilfoyle.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.362
There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.

17:08.760 --> 17:13.209
I can see by the sour, pinched expressions
on all your faces

17:13.280 --> 17:17.126
that Richard has filled you in
regarding the unfortunate circumstances

17:17.200 --> 17:21.125
that have forced me to relinquish my stake
in your fair company.

17:21.280 --> 17:26.047
Erlich, you should know that
I have written a press release.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.328
- Oh?
- I'm not going to release it yet,

17:28.440 --> 17:31.649
but if I hear wind of these rumors
spreading out of control,

17:31.720 --> 17:35.611
I'm going to send it to every tech publication
and blog on the face of the Earth.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.761
Do you understand?

17:36.840 --> 17:39.047
- Even UPROXX?
- Yes, even them.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.160
Also, uh...

17:43.640 --> 17:47.690
This is the check for next month's use
of the house as our office,

17:47.760 --> 17:49.728
but we'll be out by the end of the month.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.689
Richard, it doesn't have to be like this.

17:51.760 --> 17:55.401
From this point forward, you will have
nothing to do with this company whatsoever.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.166
I'm replacing you on the board,
and I'm giving your seat to Jared.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.128
- So that's it then.
- Yes.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.361
So I guess we better get ready
for that Vanity <i>Fair</i> event.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.966
What?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.284
Did you not listen to a word I just said?

18:10.400 --> 18:13.688
I heard thousands of words
about rumors and the need to contain them.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.570
What do you think would happen
if I didn't show up to this Vanity Fair event?

18:16.640 --> 18:18.051
I've already RSVP'd

18:18.120 --> 18:21.727
and given them a list of phony
dietary restrictions just to cause a scene.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.802
I told them I was pesca-pescatarian.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.130
Which is one who eats solely fish
who eat other fish.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.203
I think my absence would be noted.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.767
- Erlich brings up a good point.
-It's true.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.450
Let us not forget Meinertzhagen's...

18:34.520 --> 18:36.284
Yes, yes, Meinertzhagen's Haversack.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.362
We all remember his sack.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.849
Okay, fine. Yeah.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.888
Sure. You can come. I can't stop you.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.688
Uh, I'll be taking the car and the hotel room
and you're going to have to drive yourself.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.091
Consider it my farewell dinner.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.406
See you at the event.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.528
- Jared, are you okay?
-It's just so many emotions.

19:03.600 --> 19:08.049
The board seat. I feel regret and a glee
that you would choose to honor me,

19:08.120 --> 19:11.841
and terror at not living up
to your expectations,

19:11.960 --> 19:14.531
and compassion for Erlich's loss.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.051
Oh, Donald, you've come undone.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.521
You still want him on the board?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.008
Hi, there. Checking in. Richard Hendricks.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.411
Fuck me. Hey, Richie.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.965
Oh, God. Hey, Russ.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.530
What's up, boy genius? You here fucking?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.841
Huh? No. No, no, no fucking.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.491
<i>Just here for the Vanity Fair dinner.</i>

19:36.560 --> 19:37.721
Oh, yeah, I know that stupid dinner.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.802
Bunch of VC douchebags
jerking each other off.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.564
Speaking of, I got this girl at the bar,

19:41.640 --> 19:43.085
I'm trying to take her up
to the presidential suite

19:43.200 --> 19:44.770
before her fucking bridesmaids
ruin the whole thing,

19:44.840 --> 19:46.365
but they're telling me it's booked.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.529
Who is it? Is it Gore? Fuck that guy.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.329
- Oh, God.
- I saw Pied Piper launched.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.686
Haven't tried it, probably won't.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.446
I don't even want to think about how fucked
I got missing out on Erlich's shares. Fuck.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.044
Wait, he tried to sell you his shares?

20:00.120 --> 20:02.726
Well, half of them.
He was pretty desperate to stay on the team.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.802
Well, he didn't mention
anything about this to me.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.565
Of course not. Why would he?
It's fucking humiliating losing all your money.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.723
You think when I dropped below $1 billion
I walked around telling everybody? Fuck no.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.847
You guys were the only ones who knew,

20:11.920 --> 20:13.046
and I actually thought about
having you killed.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.327
- I'm sorry, what?
- So Erlich and I, like two weeks ago,

20:15.440 --> 20:16.566
we had a contract ready.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.529
Five mil
I was gonna pay him for half his shares.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.967
It was a win-win.
Then that robot, Laurie Bream,

20:21.040 --> 20:22.849
sweeps in and cockblocks the whole thing.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.730
She forces him to sell her all his shares.
You think she's gay?

20:25.800 --> 20:29.885
Maybe. It hasn't come up.
I... So wait, she outbid you?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.928
Outbid me? No, she didn't have to.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.361
You don't even know how
your own fucking company works?

20:34.440 --> 20:37.489
All right, Mr. Hendricks, we have you
staying one night in a deluxe double.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.641
Okay, do you have a tub in that room?

20:38.720 --> 20:39.801
Does he have a tub in that room?

20:39.880 --> 20:40.927
I don't know. There's no way of telling.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.082
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm gonna take her to the W.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.845
She's so drunk she won't know the difference.
See you around, Richie.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.605
<i>Hey, it's C.J.</i>

20:59.680 --> 21:03.685
<i>Listen, I'm hearing a rumor about
some serious ugliness going on at Pied Piper.</i>

21:04.600 --> 21:07.649
<i>I've heard it from three different people now.
You need to call me.</i>

21:09.160 --> 21:10.366
Fuck.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.610
What in God's name is the reason
to get a higher education?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.523
You can just buy a megafreeze for 35 cents.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.045
Laurie, can I talk to you for a second?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.805
Yes, uh, Richard Hendricks,
do you know Mark Pincus?

21:20.880 --> 21:21.881
Hello. Big fan.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.928
Oh, okay. Yes. Um...

21:24.000 --> 21:25.923
- Sorry, just one second.
- Yes. All right.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.085
I'm sorry to cut away like this.
We can continue discussing this.

21:32.720 --> 21:36.930
Okay, uh, look,
I know Erlich sold you all of his shares.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.970
I'm just wondering
exactly how that happened.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.486
Ah, yes. It was one of my finer moments.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.451
Erlich came to me with an outside offer
to sell half of his Pied Piper shares.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.444
To Russ Hanneman for $5 million.
Yes, I know.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.649
But somehow you ended up
with all of his shares. How?

21:52.720 --> 21:56.042
Oh, well, as you know,
the same onerous terms you accepted

21:56.120 --> 21:57.804
when you took Russ Hanneman's money,

21:57.920 --> 21:59.684
they transferred to me when I bought him out.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.762
These included the right
to block any transfer of stocks

22:01.880 --> 22:04.247
with a majority vote of the board.
A board which I control.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.329
- I don't understand.
- Of course you do.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.924
If I have approval of any buyer,
and I am the only buyer I approve,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.764
then I can set my own price.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.011
So I asked Mr. Bachman
for a thorough accounting of his debts,

22:18.080 --> 22:20.845
which ran to approximately $713,000.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.649
And how much did you give him?

22:22.720 --> 22:24.609
$713,000.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.207
Jesus. So, he walked away with nothing.

22:28.280 --> 22:32.683
Oh, yes. And so as I said,
you're the one who accepted these terms,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.649
so you're the one
who enabled this action on my part.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.768
All credit goes to you, Richard. Excuse me.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.808
Dick. Dick Costolo. One moment.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.006
I need to speak with you.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.290
It's expensive to replant.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.807
No. The vines are bad. The soil is bad.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.242
Excuse me, what is that?

23:03.360 --> 23:04.805
That's pesca-pescatarian.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.243
- It's fish that...
- Actually, just bring me one of those.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.890
- Me, too.
- Yeah, waiter, I'll take one, too.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.803
- I want one.
- I want one of those also.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.890
Wait, hey, hey, I'd like that also.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.210
Excuse me,
if he's having one, I want one.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.089
You're getting that, I want it, too.
Excuse me!

23:20.920 --> 23:23.400
Hey, I thought you were at the dinner.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.720
I left.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.851
Erlich never showed. Is he here?

23:27.920 --> 23:30.082
Yeah. He's hiding in the backyard.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.491
Why?

23:32.280 --> 23:34.089
Have you not seen the article?

23:34.160 --> 23:35.161
No.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.684
"Is Erlich Bachman
the Dumbest Man in Tech"?

23:43.760 --> 23:46.206
What the hell is this?
I never sent anything out.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.529
- Who did they talk to?
- Erlich.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.368
This is C.J.'s blog.
He outed himself to protect Pied Piper.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.681
Yeah, this is way harsher
than anything you ever wrote.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.849
Plus, there's the visual component.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.050
Speaking of... Where's your jacket, Jared?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.328
That was quite a piece.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.969
Informative. Thorough.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.168
You certainly know how to make an impact.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.684
And I guess I don't have to worry about
any rumors coming out.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.046
Those are handled.

24:22.360 --> 24:26.160
You know, Erlich, uh,
Pied Piper still needs a head of PR.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.960
You seem to be well-versed
in media outreach.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.849
And by your own admission in that article,
your head is, uh, what did you say,

24:36.200 --> 24:39.249
so far up your own ass
you can see the future.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.321
And that could be useful.

24:41.400 --> 24:45.724
If we need a pre-cog...

24:46.960 --> 24:48.121
...in away.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.005
Uh, I don't know if you're available, so...

24:51.080 --> 24:53.401
Are you offering me a job?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.403
Well, we have a good option package.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.806
It won't be quite what you had,
but it's something.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.251
That's very generous.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.971
So things could go back
to the way they were before.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.010
Well, no. No. Not exactly the way they were.

25:10.080 --> 25:14.768
No, no. Uh, well, this would be an actual job
and you would have responsibilities.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.207
Would this job have a title?

25:17.280 --> 25:21.126
Something, say, Chief Evangelism Officer?

25:21.200 --> 25:22.884
So, "CEO"?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.367
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the fuck was that?

25:26.120 --> 25:28.521
Richard.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.251
The Pied Piper app
just got accepted into the Hooli store.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.051
What? Holy shit.

25:34.120 --> 25:39.047
Gavin Belson just presented us
with his bare buttocks in submission.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.407
We beat him. I don't hug. No.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.485
Um, okay, hey, look, time to issue
your first press release, right?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.883
It's very late, Richard, and I'm very high.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.041
Erlich, I don't care.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.043
You have to do it, okay? Now.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.407
- It's your job.
- Okay.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.686
All right.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.926
C.J. Cantwell.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.923
<i>Erlich Bachman. The reason I'm calling</i>

26:04.040 --> 26:08.921
has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever
with the fact that I own half of your blog

26:09.000 --> 26:10.729
<i>and everything to do with the fact</i>

26:10.800 --> 26:15.044
that I was just named
Chief Evangelism Officer of Pied Piper.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.086
<i>Feel free to abbreviate that,
whatever acronym is most economical.</i>

26:19.160 --> 26:20.207
And I have a story.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.931
<i>Well, if it's anything like this last one,
I am all for it.</i>

26:23.000 --> 26:25.606
I am getting so many paid views
on your tell-all.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.523
<i>Everyone in the Valley is reading it.</i>

26:27.600 --> 26:30.843
Well, that's good. For you.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.445
At my expense, I guess.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.450
Anyway, I had no choice.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.409
As you said, it was going to come out
one way or another.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.926
Why? No one knew about any of it
until you told me.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.924
What do you mean? You said that
you had heard from a bunch of people

26:43.000 --> 26:46.129
that there are all these rumors
about ugly shit going down at Pied Piper.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.771
That's literally the only reason
that I told you any of this.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.289
What?
Oh, yeah, three different people told me

26:53.360 --> 26:55.727
that Pied Piper had
the ugliest jackets they'd ever seen.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.807
Jackets?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.962
I was going to do, like,
a whole swag fail thing, you know?

26:59.080 --> 27:00.491
<i>That could have been cool, no?</i>

27:00.840 --> 27:02.683
Who the fuck cares about jackets?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.287
Hey, come on, <i>babe</i>

27:05.360 --> 27:07.124
<i>Follow me</i>

27:07.200 --> 27:09.441
<i>I'm the Pied Piper</i>

27:09.520 --> 27:13.206
<i>Follow me, I'm the Pied Piper</i>

27:13.280 --> 27:17.126
<i>And I'll show you where it's at</i>

27:17.480 --> 27:18.970
<i>Come on, babe</i>

27:19.040 --> 27:20.280
<i>Can't you see?</i>

27:20.360 --> 27:24.206
<i>I'm the Pied Piper, trust in me</i>

27:24.280 --> 27:26.487
<i>I'm the Pied Piper</i>

27:26.560 --> 27:31.248
<i>And I'll show you where it's at</i>

27:32.920 --> 27:36.367
<i>Girl, don't be scared to move</i>

27:36.440 --> 27:40.206
<i>Hey, babe, what are you tryin' to prove</i>

27:40.280 --> 27:44.205
<i>It ain't true that your life has kicked you</i>

27:44.280 --> 27:49.605
<i>It's your mind and that's all that's trickin' you</i>

27:50.600 --> 27:54.366
<i>So step in line</i>

27:54.440 --> 27:58.525
<i>Hey, come on, babe, follow me</i>

27:58.600 --> 28:02.491
<i>I'm the Pied Piper, follow me</i>

28:02.560 --> 28:05.006
<i>I'm the Pied Piper</i>

28:05.120 --> 28:09.728
<i>And I'll show you where it's at</i>

28:10.560 --> 28:12.483
<i>Come on, babe</i>

28:12.560 --> 28:14.085
<i>Can't you see?</i>

28:14.160 --> 28:17.926
<i>Come on, babe, follow me</i>

28:18.000 --> 28:21.129
<i>I'm the Pied Piper</i>
