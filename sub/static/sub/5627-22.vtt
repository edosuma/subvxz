09:16.650 --> 09:18.641
SPOOF ME, THE STORM,
GAMERCALL--

09:18.690 --> 09:21.659
WAIT. WHAT WAS THAT
MIDDLE ONE, THE STORM?

09:21.690 --> 09:22.452
YEAH. WHY?

09:22.490 --> 09:25.857
THAT WAS ANTONIA'S MESSAGE
TO HOTCH.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.858
"THERE'S A STORM COMING,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.095
AND YOU'LL BE SWEPT AWAY."

09:30.130 --> 09:32.792
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT THIS FEELS LIKE
A MASSIVE STORM.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.034
IT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.059
YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO WAY

09:35.100 --> 09:36.738
SHE COULD HAVE PULLED THIS
OFF FROM INSIDE PRISON.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.863
BUT SHE KNEW ABOUT IT
ENOUGH TO TOY WITH HOTCH.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.969
ANYBODY WANT TO GO SLAP
THAT SMIRK OFF HER FACE?

09:41.010 --> 09:43.274
YEAH, SHE'S BEEN PULLING
STRINGS SINCE WE MET HER.

09:43.310 --> 09:46.711
SHE WANTED THE BAU'S
ATTENTION, BUT WHY?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.149
HER NARCISSISM.

09:48.180 --> 09:51.149
WE EACH SPENT TIME WITH HER,
A LOT OF IT.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.112
BUT SHE DIDN'T MENTION
THE STORM

09:53.160 --> 09:55.287
UNTIL HOTCH WENT BACK
TO QUESTION HER AGAIN.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.754
IT WAS A RETORT, AFTER
HOTCH EXPOSED HER PAST.

09:57.790 --> 10:00.258
AND HER SON.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.629
[DOOR BUZZES OPEN]

10:16.440 --> 10:18.408
[DOOR CLOSES]

10:18.450 --> 10:20.338
YOU ENJOYING THIS?

10:20.380 --> 10:22.371
I'M A CREATURE OF HABIT.

10:22.420 --> 10:25.309
I PREFER WE DO THIS
IN MY CELL.

10:27.790 --> 10:29.257
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
WARNED US.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.884
YOU'D ONLY WARN US
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN IT FOR YOU.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.397
OH, YOU REALLY ARE SMART.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.250
SO IT GOT ME THINKING.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.767
YOU'RE IN HERE FOR LIFE.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.667
WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY GAIN?

10:43.440 --> 10:46.409
YOUR SON WAS BORN
WHEN YOU WERE ONLY 14.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.672
WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM...
43 NOW?

10:50.710 --> 10:54.111
YOUR FAMILY WAS ASHAMED.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.448
SO HE WAS RAISED
AWAY FROM YOU.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.119
BUT YOU NEVER LOST
TOUCH WITH HIM.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.289
HAVE YOU ALWAYS LIVED
ON THE SAPPY SIDE,

11:01.320 --> 11:04.289
OR DID THAT COME OUT
WHEN YOU BECAME A MOTHER?

11:04.330 --> 11:08.448
THE ONLY REASON YOU
WARNED AGENT HOTCHNER
ABOUT THIS STORM

11:08.500 --> 11:11.389
IS BECAUSE YOUR SON HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

11:11.430 --> 11:13.466
AND NOW
YOU NEED OUR HELP.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.388
NOT AS MUCH AS YOU NEED MINE.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.466
YOUR SON FRAMED
A FEDERAL AGENT

11:18.510 --> 11:22.002
AND MANIPULATED SPECIAL
WEAPONS AND TACTICS
OPERATIVES TO DO IT.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.974
SO, HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT SWAT.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.739
THEY DON'T LIKE
BEING MANIPULATED.

11:25.780 --> 11:29.477
SO NOW YOUR SON
IS ON A SHOOT FIRST,
ASK QUESTIONS LATER LIST.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.889
I WANT HIM TAKEN
INTO CUSTODY, ALIVE.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.456
OF COURSE YOU DO.
WHAT MOTHER WOULDN'T?

11:35.490 --> 11:38.379
THE TRUTH IS, I CAN'T
REALLY PROMISE YOU
WHAT WILL HAPPEN

11:38.430 --> 11:39.454
IF HE GETS CAUGHT.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.152
YOU WON'T LET HIM
GET KILLED.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.328
I KNOW YOU.
YOU TOOK AN OATH

11:45.370 --> 11:47.736
AND TOO GOODY-TWO-SHOES
TO BREAK IT.

11:47.770 --> 11:51.308
YEAH, YESTERDAY,
YESTERDAY I WOULDN'T HAVE.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.831
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE YOUR SON

11:53.880 --> 11:56.474
HAD ARMED MEN POINT GUNS
IN THE SAME ROOM AS MY SON.

11:56.510 --> 12:03.712
SO, WHEN WE FIND HIM,
THIS CAN GO ONE OF TWO WAYS.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.980
PROMISE ME
HE WON'T GET HURT.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.181
GIVE ME HIS NAME.

12:19.470 --> 12:20.937
THIS IS ANTONIA'S SON.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.232
HIS NAME'S ASHER DOUGLAS.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.760
HE LIVES IN
NORTHERN VIRGINIA.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.005
EARLY 405 IS OLD
FOR A SWATTER.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.304
BUT HE'S A MATCH
IN EVERY WAY THAT COUNTS.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.808
HE PURCHASED THE STORM
SPOOFING SOFTWARE,

12:30.850 --> 12:32.772
HE BOUGHT SEVERAL AUDIO
SPLICING PROGRAMS.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.344
AND THAT'S HOW HE WAS
ABLE TO MAKE CALLS

12:34.380 --> 12:36.109
FROM HOTCH'S CELL
AND SOUND LIKE HIM.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.447
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
DOESN'T FIT.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.880
IT FITS ENOUGH FOR ME.
LET'S GO.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.026
SWA'I'TING CAN FALL
IN THE SPECTRUM
OF ONLINE PSYCHOPATHY.

12:44.060 --> 12:46.927
MEN WHO EXPRESS VIOLENT
ANTI-SOCIAL TEN DENCIES
FROM BEHIND A SCREEN

12:46.960 --> 12:48.427
THAT THE WOULD NEVER
EXPRESS IN PUBLIC.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.258
BUT THEIR PATTERNS MIRROR THAT
OF A TRADITIONAL PSYCHOPATH,

12:51.300 --> 12:53.461
AND SPECIFICALLY THE FACT
THAT THEY GET BORED EASILY.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.967
WHICH MAKES ME THINK
WE'D SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT

12:55.000 --> 12:56.968
IN HIS BROWSER HISTORY,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.363
I THOUGHT HE WAS
COVERING HIS TRACKS.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.139
EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

13:00.180 --> 13:03.445
THAT HE MADE THE 911 CALL.
WE HAVE TO ARREST HIM.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.970
HOTCH IS DEPENDING ON US.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.885
WHO GAVE YOU PROBABLE
CAUSE TO PUT ME
UNDER SURVEILLANCE?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.057
A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.888
TELL ME NOW
OR I WILL INVOKE.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.158
YOU KNOW WHO NEEDS LAWYERS?

13:18.190 --> 13:19.384
GUILTY PEOPLE.

13:19.430 --> 13:20.897
SMART PEOPLE.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.467
SO LAY OUT YOUR ENTIRE
CASE TO ME RIGHT NOW

13:23.500 --> 13:26.560
OR EVERY ATTORNEY I KNOW
WILL DROP EVERYTHING
AND COME HELP ME.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.532
WE GOT A TIP
FROM A SOURCE.

13:31.570 --> 13:34.505
AND IT WAS VERY
CONVINCING.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.905
ANTONIA SLADE.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.340
NO, NOT SLADE.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.168
Agent: ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE RECORDING
WITH PETER LEWIS,

13:42.220 --> 13:44.484
AKA MR. SCRATCH.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.488
DO YOU SWEAR UNDER
PENALTY OF PERJURY

13:46.520 --> 13:48.351
THAT THE TESTIMONY
YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE
IS THE TRUTH?

13:48.390 --> 13:49.982
MOST CERTAIN LY.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.224
Agent: AND WITH
ADVICE OF COUNSEL...

13:51.260 --> 13:52.454
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.253
Agent: ...YOU ARE GIVING
THIS TESTIMONY
OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.222
Mr. Scratch:
YES, THAT IS CORRECT.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.058
I'M NOT DOING THIS
TO CUT A DEAL.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.489
THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MAN

14:01.540 --> 14:04.304
AARON HOTCHNER REALLY IS.

14:24.290 --> 14:25.552
TURN AROUND
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.319
WHATEVER YOU'RE HOLDING,
DROP IT.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.965
BUT THEN IT WILL BREAK.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.218
DROP IT OR I WILL SHOOT YOU.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.295
[COCKS WEAPON]
I SAID DROP IT!

14:34.340 --> 14:35.466
WAIT, HOLD! EVERYONE HOLD.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.901
ASHER, IF YOU SHOW US
WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING

14:38.940 --> 14:41.170
AND IT ISN'T DANGEROUS,
WE'LL LET YOU KEEP IT.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.269
WHY WOULD IT BE DANGEROUS?

14:43.310 --> 14:46.916
BECAUSE WE'RE WITH THE POLICE
AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR THE WORST.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.542
YOU'RE NOT THE POLICE.

14:48.580 --> 14:51.549
YOU'RE WITH THE FEDERAL
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.683
YOU'RE DR. SPENCER REID.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.359
YOU'RE SUPERVISORY
SPECIAL AGENT DAVID ROSSI.

14:56.390 --> 15:00.349
I RESEARCHED ALL OF YOU
TO DECIDE WHO WOULD BE
THE BEST ONE TO SWAT,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.369
BEFORE LANDING ON
AGENT AARON HOTCHNER,

15:03.400 --> 15:06.392
SINCE HE IS THE TEAM
LEADER, OBVIOUSLY.

15:06.430 --> 15:09.194
CAN I SEE WHAT'S
IN YOUR HANDS?

15:09.240 --> 15:10.036
SLOWLY.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.079
THEY'RE, UM, MY VERSION
OF THE A-9 CHIP,

15:15.110 --> 15:16.372
ONLY MINE ARE BETTER.

15:16.410 --> 15:19.379
CAN YOU SET THEM DOWN
SO WE CAN TALK?

15:19.410 --> 15:21.344
SURE.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.288
I NEED TO PUT THESE
ON YOU, OK?

15:25.320 --> 15:26.958
BUT IT'S FOR
YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.479
OK.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.094
THERE, LET'S GO.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.463
WE SHOULD SECURE THE HOUSE,
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANYTHING ELSE HERE.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.673
BEST HOPE IS TO GET HIM
TALKING, BUT THAT
COULD BE TOUGH.

15:47.710 --> 15:48.574
WHY?

15:48.610 --> 15:50.646
WELL, HE DISPLAYS
BOTH COLLECTING BEHAVIOR

15:50.680 --> 15:52.978
AND UNIQUE
DYSGRAPHIA TRAITS
IN HIS HANDWRITING.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.238
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S AUTISTIC.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.441
IT WAS MARCH OF LAST YEAR.

15:57.490 --> 16:01.483
I DOSED AGENT HOTCHNER
WITH A DISSOCIATIVE DRUG.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.727
Agent: WHAT DID THIS DRUG DO?

16:03.760 --> 16:08.094
IT PUT YOU IN A STATE
WHERE YOU EXPERIENCED
A WAKING DREAM.

16:08.130 --> 16:13.432
NOW, I TRY TO GET MY VICTIMS
TO SEE THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES.

16:13.470 --> 16:17.463
BUT AGENT HOTCHNER, WELL...

16:17.510 --> 16:19.466
HE WENT IN
HIS OWN DIRECTION.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.774
Agent: WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

16:21.810 --> 16:25.246
HE STARTED RAMBLING ABOUT
HOW I KILLED HIS TEAM,

16:25.280 --> 16:27.009
WHICH I EXPECTED.

16:27.050 --> 16:29.314
BUT THEN...

16:29.350 --> 16:32.478
HE STARTED TO LAUGH...

16:32.520 --> 16:35.353
LIKE HE WAS DELIGHTED.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.426
AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

16:37.460 --> 16:42.193
IN THAT MOMENT,
I WAS SCARED...

16:42.230 --> 16:44.369
OF HIM.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.439
OF WHAT HE COULD DO
TO HIS OWN TEAM.

16:48.470 --> 16:51.030
OR HIS OWN SON,
FOR THAT MATTER.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.379
I WAS SCARED--

16:53.410 --> 16:56.129
WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE
ANYTHING HE SAYS?

16:56.180 --> 16:57.374
WE DIDN'T.

16:57.410 --> 17:00.277
BUT IT GOT US DIGGING,
INTO YOU.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.469
WHAT ABOUT ME?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.578
WAS YOUR WIFE KILLED

17:02.620 --> 17:05.612
BECAUSE OF YOUR
RESPONSIBILITIES
WITH THIS JOB? YES.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.813
DID YOU QUESTION
YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE BAU

17:08.860 --> 17:11.328
AFTER HER MURDER? YES.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.759
AND HOW DOES THAT
CONNECT TO THIS?

17:12.790 --> 17:16.521
BECAUSE IT WAS THEN
THAT YOU STARTED
DISMISSING PROCEDURE.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.697
I DID NOT.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.698
YOU FAKED
AGENT PRENTISS' DEATH.

17:19.730 --> 17:23.405
YOU RUBBER-STAMPED
THE UNJUSTIFIED SHOOTING,
BY AGENT ROSSI,

17:23.440 --> 17:26.238
OF THE MAN WHO KILLED
JASON GIDEON,

17:26.270 --> 17:28.534
GIVING HIM A PASS
FOR THE SAME CRIME

17:28.580 --> 17:32.072
YOU EXPELLED AGENT
GREENAWAY FOR 10 YEARS AGO.

17:32.110 --> 17:35.409
EACH OF THOSE INSTANCES
WAS A JUDGMENT CALL.

17:35.450 --> 17:38.613
AND IT'S A WASTE
OF OUR TIME FOR ME
TO JUSTIFY EACH ONE.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.254
BUT I CAN.

17:40.290 --> 17:43.259
GOOD. BECAUSE
THIS LAST ONE

17:43.290 --> 17:45.588
IS ONE YOU HAVE
NO DEFENSE FOR.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.661
HE SUBJECTED YOU
TO A VERY POWERFUL DRUG...

17:50.700 --> 17:54.659
UHH! UHH! UHH!

17:54.700 --> 17:55.735
OHH!

17:55.770 --> 17:57.738
ONE THAT WITH OTHER VICTIMS

17:57.770 --> 17:59.533
LED TO PSYCHOTIC BREAKS.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.476
NOW, WHY WOULDN'T YOU
INCLUDE THAT

18:03.510 --> 18:07.412
IN YOUR BUREAU
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION?

18:07.450 --> 18:10.214
AGENT?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.684
AGENT?

18:17.160 --> 18:19.458
WE'RE LOOKING AT A CASE
OF COUNTERFEIT DEVIANCE.

18:19.490 --> 18:22.254
IF ASHER IS AUTISTIC,
HE HAS TROUBLE READING
SOCIAL CUES.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.518
YEAH, BUT IN THIS CASE
WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY
HIGH-FUNCTIONING.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.322
WHAT USED TO BE LABELED
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME.

18:26.370 --> 18:28.895
AND THAT'S WHERE THE
COUNTERFEIT DEVIANCE COMES IN.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.465
DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES INCLUDE
HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISTICS

18:31.510 --> 18:34.331
WHO COLLECT CHILD PORN
OR PRETEND TO PLAN
A SCHOOL SHOOTING.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.598
THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S
POWER IN THOSE IMAGES
AND THOSE ACTIONS,

18:36.640 --> 18:38.449
BUT FOR THEM THERE'S
NO PARAPHILIA BEHIND IT.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.619
THEY DON'T DERIVE
PLEASURE FROM IT.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.572
WHAT I DON'T SEE
IS EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE

18:42.620 --> 18:45.839
WHO'S INTERESTED
IN EXPLOSIVES.
WE NEED TO RULE OUT--

18:45.890 --> 18:48.609
THAT SOMEONE IS PULLING
HIS STRINGS JUST LIKE
HE'S BEEN PULLING OURS.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.628
EXACTLY. I'D LIKE TO--

18:50.660 --> 18:52.457
GO. JUST DO IT.
AND HURRY.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.151
I'M GOING TO JAIL,
AREN'T I?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.327
NOT IF YOU COOPERATE.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.691
ALL RIGHT.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.322
I DID IT.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.497
ALL OF IT.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.337
SEE, I DON'T THINK YOU DID.

19:03.370 --> 19:05.463
EVEN THE WAY
YOU JUST SAID THAT

19:05.510 --> 19:09.276
SORT OF SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S MAYBE
PROTECTING A PARTNER.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.301
WOULD A PARTNER
HAVE THE SKILL SET

19:11.350 --> 19:15.548
TO SPLICE AGENT
AARON HOTCHNER'S VOICE
INTO A 911 CALL?

19:15.580 --> 19:17.480
SOMETHING NO GAMER'S
EVER DONE BEFORE?

19:17.520 --> 19:19.909
NO. I DID THAT. ME.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.748
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT NITROMETHANE?

19:22.790 --> 19:25.281
IT'S THE SIMPLEST ORGANIC
NITRO COMPOUND.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.252
IT HAS AN R.E. FACTOR
OF 1.1.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.518
THAT'S ITS RELATIVE
EFFECTIVENESS COMPARED TO--

19:29.560 --> 19:31.664
TNT? RIGHT?

19:31.700 --> 19:34.362
HAVE YOU EVER BOUGHT IT?

19:34.400 --> 19:36.766
NO POINT. WHAT WOULD I
DO WITH IT?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.836
WELL, WHEN AGENT HOTCHNER
WAS ARRESTED,

19:38.870 --> 19:40.576
THEY FOUND THAT
HE HAD BOUGHT SOME.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.249
I THINK IT WAS PLANTED
ON HIM,

19:43.280 --> 19:45.248
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU WOULD DO THAT.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.441
[GRU NTS]

19:47.480 --> 19:48.913
I GET--
THIS ISN'T SELF-HARM.

19:48.950 --> 19:49.917
OK.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.281
I USED TO DO THAT.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.652
I DON'T DO IT ANYMORE.
INSTEAD I DO THIS.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.885
TO CONTROL HOW YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU GET CONFUSED?

19:55.920 --> 19:57.626
YES.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.254
YOU KNOW, I GET CONFUSED
A LOT, TOO, ASHER.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.623
IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE
REASONS I DECIDED TO STUDY
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS.

20:04.670 --> 20:09.937
AND I DON'T THINK MY FRIEND
WOULD BUY 40 GALLONS
OF NITROMETHANE.

20:09.970 --> 20:11.699
BUT YOURS MIGHT.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.644
4O GALLONS?

20:17.680 --> 20:18.874
DOES THAT MEAN
SOMETHING TO YOU?

20:18.910 --> 20:21.879
YEAH. WE TALKED
ABOUT IT ONCE.

20:21.920 --> 20:27.586
HOW MUCH OF A CITY
YOU COULD WIPE OUT
WITH 40 GALLONS.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.417
IT WAS A HYPOTH ETICAL,

20:29.460 --> 20:32.657
LIKE IF YOU HAD THE BIGGEST
CHEMISTRY SET IN THE WORLD.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.022
I DON'T THINK IT WAS
A HYPOTHETICAL, ASHER.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.527
HE LIED TO ME.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.460
HE DID.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.565
HELP ME, AND I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

20:45.610 --> 20:47.339
[CRYING]

20:49.380 --> 20:51.598
THE REASON I DIDN'T
MENTION THE DRUGGING

20:51.650 --> 20:53.743
IS I KNEW HOW
IT WOULD BE RECEIVED.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.874
THAT SOMEONE AT THE DOJ
WOULD MISINTERPRET,

20:56.920 --> 20:59.445
AND SOMEONE ELSE WOULD
USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.913
THAT'S ONE PROFILE.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.825
HERE'S ANOTHER.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.465
"THE MOST COMMON TRAIT
IS AN UNYIELDING BELIEF

OF COURSE.

21:47.770 --> 21:50.603

THAT I WAS GOING TO
BLOW UP MY TEAM?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.849
TURN MY SON
INTO AN ORPHAN?

22:02.880 --> 22:06.008
AND THEN--AND THIS IS
THE PART I ARGUE AGAINST
IN THE PROFILE--

22:06.050 --> 22:09.781
I WOULD CALL 911 AND TELL
YOU WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO DO?

22:12.560 --> 22:15.654
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.361
BUT I CAN'T.

22:19.930 --> 22:21.989
IF I CAN DIRECT YOUR
ATTENTION TO ROSSI'S PHONE,

22:22.040 --> 22:24.406
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU
TO ERIC RAWDON.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.738
HE HAS HAD MULTIPLE
IRC CHATS WITH ASHER

22:26.770 --> 22:28.909
UNTIL HE WAS ARRESTED
FOR CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY.

22:28.940 --> 22:30.441
Rossi: CONSPIRACY WITH WHO?

22:30.480 --> 22:31.708
Garcia: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
A BUNCH OF ANARCHISTS.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.514
RAWDON ISN'T NECESSARILY
AN ANARCHIST HIMSELF,

22:34.550 --> 22:36.541
BUT HE DID WANT TO MAKE
SOMETHING GO BOOM.

22:36.580 --> 22:39.014
SO HE'S CHARISMATIC,
DUPLICITOUS.

22:39.050 --> 22:42.417
I MEAN, HE'D HAVE TO BE
TO PERSUADE A BUNCH OF
ANARCHISTS TO RALLY AROUND HIM.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.121
WHAT'S THE OVERLAP
WITH HOTCH?

22:44.160 --> 22:46.720
OUR GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN
AND SOON TO BE RECOVERED
SIR HOTCHNER

22:46.760 --> 22:49.923

WHICH HE DEFENDED IN COURT.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.461
AND THIS IS REVENGE.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.922
NO, WE KNOW
IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.767
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
RAWDON COULD HAVE
PULLED THIS OFF

22:54.800 --> 22:57.803
WHILE IN PRISON.
GARCIA, WHAT WAS
THE LAST CONTACT

22:57.840 --> 22:58.704
RAWDON HAD WITH ASHER?

22:58.740 --> 23:00.139
UH, EMAILS FROM LAST WEEK.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.536

RESIDES.
