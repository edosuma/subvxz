Mom, when can I
get a car?

00:14.055 --> 00:16.224
Candace, you only have
your learner's permit.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.600
Yeah, but eventually I'm gonna have my
license. I think we should be ready.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.228
Right. In the meantime,
have a cookie.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.854

We're going to
the Doo Wop Hop tonight,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.254
so we're dressed like
they did in the fifties.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.339
You know, when everyone dressed like a
sitcom from the seventies. Right, Ferb?

00:49.632 --> 00:52.885
Boys, have you
seen my welder?

00:52.885 --> 00:55.263
Ferb and I were using it to put the finishing
touches on his shades. Right, Ferb?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.017
Oh, yes,
those are very hip.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.393

making me?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.901
Oh, Lawrence, sounds like
you'd better tell her.

01:08.901 --> 01:12.280
Well, I wanted it to be a
surprise, but I bought you a car.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.240
No way!
ReauV? A car?

01:14.240 --> 01:17.785
Oh, yes! It's the same car
I had when I was a lad.

01:17.785 --> 01:19.037
I figured it would be ready
when you were old enough.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.872
Uh, what do you
mean "ready"?

01:23.666 --> 01:25.793

it's not fully restored yet.

Yes, it is.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.928
You can take Candace for a

01:35.928 --> 01:37.305

I think it's cool, too.

01:37.305 --> 01:40.141
Ferb, tell them
what you told me.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.146

just a friend.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.724

you have a little visitor.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.767
Oh, he can wait.
So, what friend?

03:04.767 --> 03:06.853
Is it that girl with the dark hair
who has all those dachshunds?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.479
No, it's a different friend.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.897
Wait, no!
Don't open the door.

03:09.897 --> 03:11.858

03:11.858 --> 03:13.276

03:16.904 --> 03:18.740

03:18.740 --> 03:22.910
Hey! You were going to
blow down my door!

03:28.291 --> 03:30.918
Oh, great. See, this is why
I can't have anything nice.

03:30.918 --> 03:34.172
Anyway, come on, let me show
you what I've been working on.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.425
You see, it all started when I was
just a small boy back in Gimmelshtump.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.927
<i>Friday was always
cruise night,</i>

03:39.927 --> 03:42.263
<i>and everybody would come
out to see the hipsters</i>

03:42.263 --> 03:45.183
<i>and their cool cars
made from cannibalized parts</i>

03:45.183 --> 03:48.311
<i>left over from Drusselstein's
many foreign occupations.</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:50.938
<i>But for me, the coolest
cor of all... Ooh!</i>

03:50.938 --> 03:54.942
<i>...was the Buhmshlaka 3204,
owned by my Uncle Simpkin.</i>

03:54.942 --> 03:56.444
YOUNG DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Yeah!
You go, Uncle Simpkin.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.529

masculine than everyone else.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.323

04:08.581 --> 04:10.833
<i>DOOFENSHNARTI: Unfortunately, the
car had one major design flaw.</i>

04:10.833 --> 04:13.211
<i>The back bumper was
a surplus dynamite plunger</i>

04:13.211 --> 04:17.298
<i>and the gas tank sat directly
under the driver's seat.</i>

04:17.298 --> 04:19.216
<i>(SCREAMING)
And I never saw him again.</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:21.928

to restore his car.

the good part.

04:33.981 --> 04:35.608

04:35.608 --> 04:37.235
I needed to restrain you
for this next part

04:37.235 --> 04:38.861
because it does
get a little bit evil.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.197
Just to ensure there's
no real competition,

04:41.197 --> 04:44.492
I built a little gadget
called a Rust-inator.

04:44.492 --> 04:49.121
At the push of a button, it will
reduce every other car into red dust!

04:49.121 --> 04:52.124
Or "rust."
Wait, red dust, rust...

04:52.124 --> 04:53.876
I wonder if that's where
that word came from.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.503
I'm gonna go look up
its entomology.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.341
Yeah, I looked it up. It turns out
entomology is the study of insects.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.219
Go figure. Anyway...

05:03.219 --> 05:06.264
Now, in you go. I'll just
get in the normal way.

05:08.015 --> 05:10.977
How's it going down there?
You cozy in your steel cables?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.104
Careful with the
Rust-inator, Norm.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.064

go off inadvertently.
