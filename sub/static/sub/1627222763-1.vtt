00:43.861 --> 00:45.395
Yuri!

00:47.464 --> 00:49.332
Yuri, come on!

00:49.366 --> 00:51.435
Ah!

00:51.468 --> 00:53.303
Yuri!

01:02.579 --> 01:05.282
You're not going anywhere!

01:16.293 --> 01:17.895
Going somewhere?

01:17.929 --> 01:19.396
This wasn't the deal.

01:19.429 --> 01:21.699
Ray was supposed
to be here in person!

01:21.733 --> 01:24.769
I'm sorry,
I thought I made myself clear.

01:24.802 --> 01:27.437
We represent Ray's interests.

01:35.412 --> 01:39.583
Now, uh... key, please.

01:43.386 --> 01:44.822
Ah, Yuri.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.391
Ah!

01:49.927 --> 01:51.829
No!

01:52.864 --> 01:55.032
Didn't have to be that way.

02:00.604 --> 02:02.006
Here.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.761
Holy fuck!

02:34.571 --> 02:36.741
If... if you kill me,

02:36.774 --> 02:38.375
you're never going
to get what you want.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.978
You want to make a deal
with Ray face to face?

02:42.113 --> 02:43.748
Here's is your chance.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.697
Hey, Tommy.

02:59.730 --> 03:02.099
I got a whole box of them
in the car for you.

03:15.545 --> 03:17.882
Come on! Yeah!

03:17.915 --> 03:21.351
Oh, yeah! Come on!

03:22.954 --> 03:24.755
Hey!

03:26.523 --> 03:30.661
Oh!

03:30.695 --> 03:33.798
Whoo!

03:44.507 --> 03:47.011
How you doing? All right.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.075
- Hey, Ray.
- How you doin', Bobby?

04:22.612 --> 04:24.614
I thought you quit.

04:27.118 --> 04:30.487
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

04:36.626 --> 04:38.930
Back on the floor.
I got it from here.

04:38.963 --> 04:40.965
Okay, Ray.

04:50.174 --> 04:54.644
- You can't make me talk.
- We'll see about that.

04:54.679 --> 04:56.213
What do you two
think you're doing?

04:57.281 --> 04:58.615
I'm doing what you said.

04:58.648 --> 05:01.484
What the fuck?

05:03.586 --> 05:06.090
Did I say to kill anybody?

05:08.259 --> 05:10.761
Maybe I did.

05:17.902 --> 05:21.272
Sorry, pal.

05:21.305 --> 05:26.576
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

05:26.609 --> 05:29.612
Perhaps I didn't make it clear
I had no intention

05:29.646 --> 05:32.116
of being present
during the handoff.

05:32.149 --> 05:37.188
We had a deal, the case
in exchange for the money

05:37.221 --> 05:41.092
that you lost gambling
in my casino.

05:44.295 --> 05:47.198
I'm a self-made man,
Yuri, just like you.

05:47.231 --> 05:53.070
You made it clear you wanted to
leave your-your father out of this.

05:53.104 --> 05:56.941
So I give you high marks
for your...

05:56.974 --> 06:00.811
gallant attempt
at doing what's right.

06:00.845 --> 06:06.017
I'm aware your father is not gonna
make good on your gambling debts.

06:06.050 --> 06:09.887
So I brought you here
to renegotiate.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.125
Man to man. Mano a mano.

06:14.158 --> 06:18.896
So... I'm listening.

06:18.929 --> 06:21.966
What?

06:25.269 --> 06:26.771
What the fuck did he say?

06:26.804 --> 06:28.906
He said you're a dead man.

06:30.241 --> 06:35.246
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I am very much alive.

06:35.279 --> 06:37.348
I'm not that easy to kill.

06:37.381 --> 06:40.184
We're all friends here.

06:40.217 --> 06:45.122
So I'm sure you're gonna tell me
where the real case is.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.258
You do that,

06:47.291 --> 06:50.661
and I'll let you live
to see another day.

06:53.364 --> 06:54.732
Yeah.

07:05.876 --> 07:07.878
Boka, Boka, Boka, Boka!

07:07.912 --> 07:10.247
<i>Basta, basta.</i>

07:12.683 --> 07:16.253
The case is in a safe
in the mausoleum.

07:16.287 --> 07:19.957
622 West Tomas Street.

07:23.194 --> 07:28.666
See? That wasn't so hard,
was it, huh?

07:29.733 --> 07:32.269
Yeah?

07:33.337 --> 07:35.139
I'm listening.

07:40.811 --> 07:42.880
What's he saying now?

07:42.913 --> 07:47.818
Even if we get past the men,
we'll never get in the safe.

07:47.852 --> 07:50.888
We'll see about that,
won't we?

07:53.824 --> 07:56.861
Dispose of the body,
make it look like a robbery.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.830
You said you'd let me go.

07:59.864 --> 08:01.866
You misunderstood.

08:01.899 --> 08:05.970
I said I would let you
live for another day.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.174
Get me Lombardi.

08:13.878 --> 08:15.746
Let's have some fun,
shall we?

08:29.994 --> 08:34.198
- Hey, hey!
- What? Shit.

08:34.231 --> 08:35.933
Sorry.

08:36.866 --> 08:37.902
Did I wake you again?

08:37.934 --> 08:39.336
I mean,

08:39.370 --> 08:40.738
who needs an alarm clock

08:40.770 --> 08:42.438
when I have
this every morning?

08:42.472 --> 08:45.142
Yeah.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.211
- What time's your shift today?
- No.

08:47.244 --> 08:50.748
- No, what?
- No free food.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.350
Who said anything
about free food?

08:53.384 --> 08:56.787
Reyna...

08:56.820 --> 08:59.390
Besides, I can't make it
to the restaurant today anyways.

08:59.423 --> 09:01.058
I got some work
to take care of.

09:01.091 --> 09:04.061
Work?

09:04.094 --> 09:08.732
I thought you were done
with that shit.

09:08.766 --> 09:12.403
You know Mom would be rolling in her grave if she
knew you were still doing that type of work.

09:12.436 --> 09:14.738
I know.

09:16.974 --> 09:20.177
But just remember
why I'm doing this, Reyna.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.915
- Marcus...
- Just...

09:24.949 --> 09:27.418
Just don't.

09:32.456 --> 09:33.958
I'm gonna go put
some clothes on.

10:15.432 --> 10:17.167
Jeez.

10:19.069 --> 10:21.272
Is it just me?

10:21.305 --> 10:24.241
I'm cold.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.245
- Detectives.
- Hey.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.947
What do we got?

10:29.980 --> 10:31.815
Male. Caucasian.

10:31.849 --> 10:33.851
I gotta take this, I'm sorry.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.954
- What?
- I'm gonna be back in the car. You got this.

10:37.921 --> 10:39.390
- Dobbs here.
- This way.

10:39.423 --> 10:42.326
I'm at
the crime scene now...

10:42.359 --> 10:47.398
The victim was found
about five hours ago.

10:47.431 --> 10:52.369
- I thought you quit those.
- Oh. I haven't smoked for six months.

10:52.403 --> 10:54.405
Doesn't count as long as you
don't light the damn thing.

10:54.438 --> 10:56.940
Yeah, right.

10:56.974 --> 10:58.942
What do we got?

10:58.976 --> 11:02.012
Oh, yeah, it's
a run-of-the-mill mugging.

11:02.046 --> 11:03.947
Poor sap got shot
in the stomach.

11:03.981 --> 11:08.986
But look, there's no blood.
That's weird, right?

11:09.019 --> 11:11.955
Oh, and look, there's-there's
restraints on his wrists.

11:11.989 --> 11:14.892
What do you think?

11:15.926 --> 11:17.361
He was dumped, meatball.

11:17.394 --> 11:19.530
Sorry.

11:20.397 --> 11:22.433
Hey, excuse me.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.602
- Hi, Officer...
- Burke.

11:25.636 --> 11:27.071
Burke. Yeah.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.605
Can you take him
to the pathologist

11:28.639 --> 11:31.041
and get the DNA run for him?
Thanks.

11:31.075 --> 11:33.077
You got it, Detective.

11:33.110 --> 11:37.381
Let's hope you do a better job
than Detective Walsh here.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.417
Walsh.

11:40.451 --> 11:44.188
Smoke that, man,
your mind's turned to mush.

11:46.023 --> 11:48.459
Detective, we'll let you
know what we find.

11:48.492 --> 11:52.296
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- I do.

11:56.668 --> 11:58.435
Hey!

12:00.404 --> 12:03.107
Is that your, uh,
is that your pal Walsh over there?

12:03.140 --> 12:06.210
- What'd he do now?
- It's nothing.

12:06.243 --> 12:10.013
Just Walsh being Walsh.

12:11.615 --> 12:14.952
Don't ask, don't tell, okay.

12:17.321 --> 12:21.458
I like the guy.
He tries really hard, but...

12:21.492 --> 12:24.361
just not good at it,
like my pops.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.630
That's not why
I'm upset, though.

12:26.664 --> 12:29.366
- No?
- No.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.903
Mikhail Zoltoff is over there.

12:34.672 --> 12:36.573
Ah.

12:36.607 --> 12:38.642
So immediately your mind
goes into overdrive

12:38.676 --> 12:42.246
and you jump and...

12:42.279 --> 12:46.650
I mean, you've had that Ray Barren on your
dart board for as long as I can remember.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.119
Let me remind you, Blake,
nothing sticks to that guy.

12:49.153 --> 12:52.022
Not now, not last time...

12:52.055 --> 12:54.458
What was the name
of that girl last time? Rihanna?

12:54.491 --> 12:56.694
- Reyna.
- Reyna.

12:56.728 --> 13:00.264
Ooh, she's a pretty girl.

13:00.297 --> 13:02.232
Wonder what she's doing now.

13:03.768 --> 13:07.739
Why don't you,
uh, let this all go.

13:07.772 --> 13:12.276
Take the file, you put it in a box on
a shelf underneath a lot of other boxes

13:12.309 --> 13:15.646
and you...
you forget about it, all right?

13:15.680 --> 13:18.716
Listen, I need your car.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.551
It's nice and warm in here.

13:20.584 --> 13:23.153
And I'm gonna need it
for a little bit.

13:23.187 --> 13:26.023
We don't need anymore
manic spells from you, okay?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.524
'Cause, buddy,
you go kinda nuts.

13:29.259 --> 13:31.128
Thanks for your help.

14:19.243 --> 14:23.080
- Mr. Barren?
- Yeah?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.183
Keep an eye on table two.

14:26.216 --> 14:28.452
Yes, boss.

14:29.654 --> 14:32.222
Marcus, my boy,
how are you?

14:32.256 --> 14:35.292
What do you want?

14:35.325 --> 14:37.461
Come on.

14:37.494 --> 14:40.297
Is that the thanks I get
for taking care of you

14:40.330 --> 14:42.432
after the military
fucked you up?

14:42.466 --> 14:45.369
- What do you need, Ray?
- I've got a job for you.

14:45.402 --> 14:48.706
It's a little complicated,
but nothing you can't handle.

14:48.740 --> 14:51.776
I need you to bring me
this... this case

14:51.809 --> 14:53.644
that's locked in a safe.

14:53.678 --> 14:55.747
I'm not a safe cracker, Ray.

14:55.780 --> 14:58.448
You were
an extraction specialist

14:58.482 --> 15:00.752
with the Delta Force,
weren't you?

15:00.785 --> 15:06.156
I mean, if something needed to be
retrieved using unconventional means,

15:06.189 --> 15:08.292
you were the man to call.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.427
At least you were.

15:11.696 --> 15:13.564
By the way...

15:14.464 --> 15:17.200
Marcus!

15:17.234 --> 15:19.102
How's that lovely
sister of yours?

15:19.136 --> 15:21.605
- Don't fucking mention her.
- Stop.

15:21.638 --> 15:24.842
You're embarrassing yourself.

15:24.876 --> 15:27.679
You... you act like your hands
are clean, but they're not.

15:27.712 --> 15:31.415
You act like the hero,
because you're not.

15:31.448 --> 15:34.786
You think I'm reasonable,
but I'm not.

15:34.819 --> 15:37.822
You work for me, that leaves
nothing off the table.

15:37.855 --> 15:42.326
- That includes your sister who I seem to remember...
- Ray...

15:42.359 --> 15:46.129
...laid with me once or twice
on some table.

15:46.163 --> 15:49.299
Well, should I ask Boka
to go grab her?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.903
Huh? Third time's the charm.

15:51.936 --> 15:54.504
Just tell me
where the fucking case is.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.541
That's where things
get complicated.

15:57.574 --> 15:58.810
Of course they do.

16:05.449 --> 16:07.785
- No way.
- I told you,

16:07.819 --> 16:10.655
- it's complicated.
- It's suicide!

16:10.688 --> 16:12.857
Or freedom. For you.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.491
For her.

16:14.524 --> 16:16.259
Better choice.

16:16.293 --> 16:18.629
You'll probably die anyway.

16:18.663 --> 16:21.231
But what better place, right?

16:25.602 --> 16:27.772
Take the car out back.

16:37.849 --> 16:40.952
You are going to love this place.
They have the best corned beef and cabbage.

16:40.985 --> 16:43.788
- It's 7:00 am.
- Yeah, it's a great time to start having meat.

16:43.821 --> 16:45.555
- What're you doing?
- Hey!

16:45.589 --> 16:47.524
It was your idea for me
to start smoking again.

16:47.557 --> 16:49.626
I was kidding.

16:49.661 --> 16:51.528
Oh, you're a meatball.

16:51.561 --> 16:54.364
What if your wife finds out?
She gonna totally kill me.

16:54.398 --> 16:56.566
Yeah, but if I'm going down,
I'm bringing you with me.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.502
The fuck you are.

16:59.737 --> 17:01.471
Yeah, yeah.

17:01.505 --> 17:04.340
- She's gonna get you.
- Hi, welcome to Crossroads Cafe.

17:05.409 --> 17:06.844
Uh, can we have a table?

17:06.877 --> 17:09.479
- Uh, just... just two?
- Yep.

17:09.512 --> 17:11.415
Uh, no Rhonda today?

17:11.448 --> 17:12.950
No, she's visiting
family overseas.

17:12.983 --> 17:15.551
Oh, good for her. Have you
been working here long?

17:15.585 --> 17:17.855
Just a couple of months.

17:17.888 --> 17:19.790
Get ready to see my mug a lot.

17:19.824 --> 17:23.560
- Nice to meet you.
- Right this way.

17:27.932 --> 17:29.767
Goddamn it.

17:33.470 --> 17:37.641
All right, here you guys go.
And Miss Tina will be with you shortly.

17:37.675 --> 17:39.476
Thank you.

17:40.678 --> 17:41.913
So... you gonna eat,

17:41.946 --> 17:43.346
or are you gonna stare

17:43.380 --> 17:45.315
at the pretty host?

17:45.348 --> 17:47.384
I'm, um, I'm actually gonna
use the bathroom.

17:47.417 --> 17:50.888
- Oh.
- Order me something healthy, please.

17:50.922 --> 17:53.523
I make no promises.

17:53.557 --> 17:56.293
Where's my honey biscuits?
Tina!

17:59.831 --> 18:05.368
God, it's that honey biscuits
guy at table 12 again.

18:06.570 --> 18:09.807
Hey, you okay, Reyna?

18:09.841 --> 18:12.877
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

18:12.910 --> 18:15.312
Thanks, Tina.

18:19.349 --> 18:24.021
Okay. I'm gonna go
check on five.

18:24.055 --> 18:25.422
Yeah.

18:32.063 --> 18:34.564
What are you doing?
How did you find me?

18:34.598 --> 18:38.535
Coincidence. This is Walsh's
favorite place. I swear to God.

18:38.568 --> 18:41.404
Oh, really? Whatever.
That's bullshit.

18:41.438 --> 18:43.640
You think I'd eat here?

18:43.674 --> 18:45.877
I didn't mean it like that.

18:47.111 --> 18:49.814
You think you're special.

18:49.847 --> 18:52.984
You're just
a disappointment like...

18:53.017 --> 18:56.687
You think you just put on a uniform
and do whatever the hell you want.

18:56.721 --> 18:58.756
Well, your words mean shit.

18:58.790 --> 19:01.324
You used me to get to Ray

19:01.358 --> 19:03.961
and then you left me there,
like a fool.

19:03.995 --> 19:05.897
I didn't leave you there.

19:08.699 --> 19:10.067
There was nothing I could do.

19:10.101 --> 19:13.938
I've checked on you.

19:13.971 --> 19:16.040
Oh. Well, while you
were checking on me,

19:16.073 --> 19:19.442
did you see that I had
to give everything up?

19:19.476 --> 19:22.013
I had to leave everything
behind because of you.

19:23.714 --> 19:25.850
Everything.

19:26.784 --> 19:28.820
Reyna, I'm sorry.

19:30.387 --> 19:32.657
Grow up, Blake.

19:34.692 --> 19:36.459
I have to work.

20:03.754 --> 20:06.657
622 West Tomas Street?

20:06.691 --> 20:11.394
No, bro, that's suicide.
That's Russian mob down there.

20:11.428 --> 20:13.530
I know it is, buddy.
I just need the layout.

20:13.563 --> 20:15.800
- You need the layout?
- Yeah.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.534
What exactly do you
think this is, Marcus?

20:17.567 --> 20:20.570
You just walk in here,
say you need something, and bam!

20:20.604 --> 20:23.540
I drop my vape, solve my Rubik's
cube and pull a detailed schematic

20:23.573 --> 20:26.509
of a Russian mob hideaway
out of my ass?

20:26.543 --> 20:27.678
Yeah.

20:29.446 --> 20:32.649
- Fuck.
- Give me that.

20:39.023 --> 20:42.193
- 622, not 266, right?
- 622, Auggy.

20:42.226 --> 20:44.762
- Come on, stop fucking around.
- I got it, I got it.

20:45.663 --> 20:46.864
It's a mausoleum.

20:46.898 --> 20:48.598
It's a mausoleum,
you know that, right?

20:48.632 --> 20:50.134
Full of Russian guards. I mean,

20:50.167 --> 20:52.535
I'm not one for foreshadowing,
but it doesn't really get

20:52.569 --> 20:55.006
much clearer than this, dude.

20:55.039 --> 20:58.075
Yes, I have blueprints
of the entire city.

21:00.477 --> 21:01.946
You're a smart guy,
you know that?

21:01.979 --> 21:03.814
Are you sure
you want to do this?

21:03.848 --> 21:06.751
We're talking alarms,
armed guards.

21:06.784 --> 21:09.220
I mean, hell, I don't even know if
I'd make it out of this place alive.

21:09.253 --> 21:13.124
Don't expect any cameras, 'cause Russians
tend to veer more on the analog side,

21:13.157 --> 21:16.593
which could play in your favor,
but could also lead to your death.

21:16.626 --> 21:18.195
I mean, it's an abyss,
a black hole.

21:18.229 --> 21:20.798
You go in there, we have no idea
the horrors you might face.

21:20.831 --> 21:23.067
Dude, I'm just getting the case
and getting the hell out.

21:23.100 --> 21:27.104
Well, if it's in this place, it might as
well be the Ark of the fucking Covenant.

21:27.138 --> 21:29.506
Was the Ark inside of a safe?

21:29.539 --> 21:31.909
- How dare you.
- What?

21:31.943 --> 21:33.510
No. It's... it is the safe.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.213
It's a gold box
with bars to lift it...

21:36.247 --> 21:41.085
Wait, wait. Are you telling me right
now this thing is inside of a safe?

21:41.118 --> 21:44.521
Marcus, no! No,
this is getting a lot harder.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.191
Auggy, buddy, listen to me.
I'll be fine.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.926
I just gotta get the safe open.

21:50.895 --> 21:53.630
All right,
this is Margherita.

21:53.664 --> 21:58.002
It's an advanced password cracking
program of my own design. Okay?

21:58.035 --> 22:00.905
As long as it's digital, the
safe, we can crack it remotely

22:00.938 --> 22:03.107
and tell you where to place it
and we'll do it.

22:03.140 --> 22:04.976
Wait.
What if it's mechanical?

22:05.009 --> 22:09.512
Right. Um...
Let's see...

22:09.546 --> 22:12.016
Ah! This will
take care of that.

22:12.683 --> 22:14.051
- Really?
- Yes.

22:14.085 --> 22:16.053
So I will be able
to tell you where to go

22:16.087 --> 22:20.691
accordingly to my action cam.
All right?

22:20.725 --> 22:23.260
It's right here, you put it in your
pocket and put it on your chest later.

22:23.294 --> 22:27.031
Perfect.
Looking good, you ready?

22:27.064 --> 22:31.702
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
This'll, uh, this'll work, right?

22:31.736 --> 22:34.905
Yeah, I'll be your set of eyes
and ears beyond that wall. Okay?

22:34.939 --> 22:37.241
I'll be able to see what you see and
point you in the right direction.

22:37.274 --> 22:40.845
But this shit is illegal, okay?
And it's dangerous.

22:40.878 --> 22:43.948
If something goes down,
I'm completely powerless.

22:45.716 --> 22:48.618
- Marcus.
- I'll be careful, Auggy.

22:48.652 --> 22:51.621
That's great, but I was
gonna say don't get caught.

22:51.655 --> 22:53.324
I won't.

22:53.357 --> 22:56.227
And if you do,
you don't know me.

22:58.662 --> 23:00.798
Love you too, Augustus.

23:00.831 --> 23:03.600
I tell you never
to say that name!

23:04.368 --> 23:06.137
He's dead.

23:09.340 --> 23:12.176
Hey, sis,
it's nice out here today, huh?

23:12.209 --> 23:17.181
Wanted to say hello before I head
over to the mausoleum and see Annie.

23:17.214 --> 23:20.617
I need to fix these glasses.

23:37.668 --> 23:40.204
You're not
answering your phone.

23:42.907 --> 23:46.744
My oncologist likes to talk.

23:46.777 --> 23:48.913
He saying anything good?

23:48.946 --> 23:51.082
Oh, yeah.

23:52.149 --> 23:54.151
It's all good.
Hunky dory.

23:54.185 --> 23:57.021
I need you
back at the station.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.961
I can't get you
to drop this case?

24:03.994 --> 24:06.197
Drop this case?

24:06.230 --> 24:09.632
I've been working this case
for six years.

24:12.937 --> 24:15.706
Hey, Dobbs.

24:15.739 --> 24:17.942
We all got problems.

24:17.975 --> 24:20.711
Everyone.

24:20.744 --> 24:23.280
But we fucking
deal with them.

24:29.687 --> 24:31.889
We deal with them...

24:34.225 --> 24:37.228
I like it here.
I like it here!

24:38.696 --> 24:43.701
I can... I can complain
and no one talks back.

24:43.734 --> 24:45.169
Right?

24:54.044 --> 24:56.213
Dobbs.

24:56.247 --> 24:59.683
Mm-hm. I'm still working on it.

24:59.717 --> 25:02.820
I'll head there after it's done.
All right?

25:02.853 --> 25:04.889
Okay. Yeah, I got it.

25:36.187 --> 25:40.124
All right. You ready, Marcus?
Because it is showtime.

25:40.157 --> 25:41.825
<i>Ready as I can be.</i>

25:43.460 --> 25:46.230
All right,
we're up and running.

25:46.263 --> 25:51.168
All right, action cam is up
and we are live.

25:51.202 --> 25:53.904
<i>How's the baby earpiece?
Can you hear me?</i>

25:53.938 --> 25:55.172
<i>Why is nothing going on?</i>

25:55.206 --> 25:57.007
It's actually pretty boring.

25:57.041 --> 25:58.909
Shut the fuck up, Auggy.

25:58.943 --> 26:00.778
<i>I'm just saying.
You're just standing there.</i>

26:00.811 --> 26:02.746
<i>When are you gonna "Van Damme"
leg split someone,</i>

26:02.780 --> 26:04.114
<i>do something,
we don't got all day now.</i>

26:04.148 --> 26:05.449
I know, I'm working on it.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.885
<i>Dump a plant! Real clever.</i>

26:07.918 --> 26:09.119
<i>You're so dead.</i>

26:12.022 --> 26:13.991
<i>What're you waiting for?</i>

26:17.928 --> 26:21.832
All right, you got him. Okay, uh,
grab his key card, you're gonna need that.

26:21.865 --> 26:24.535
<i>Take your time, big boy.
It's not like we're in a hurry or anything.</i>

26:24.568 --> 26:27.805
I got it, I got it. Come on.

26:27.838 --> 26:29.873
- <i>Parkour!</i>
- Shut up, Auggy.

26:29.907 --> 26:31.475
All right, now use his key card
at the front entrance.

26:31.508 --> 26:35.312
<i>On your right.
On your other right.</i>

26:35.346 --> 26:36.814
<i>Good.</i>

26:47.024 --> 26:50.394
All right, I guess it's lunch time so
there's less people than I thought.

26:50.427 --> 26:52.963
This is good.
Bogey coming at your noon.

26:52.997 --> 26:55.232
All right, act casual.
Just super casual.

26:55.266 --> 26:57.001
<i>Not that casual.</i>

26:58.469 --> 27:00.904
<i>You're clear right now,
but sneak faster.</i>

27:06.043 --> 27:09.046
<i>Gen Z. Always on their phones.</i>

27:09.079 --> 27:12.916
<i>Wait here. Let me see the whole
area before you take him out.</i>

27:12.950 --> 27:15.119
All right.

27:15.152 --> 27:18.422
Okay, we're clear up top
and down both hallways.

27:18.455 --> 27:21.492
I'd take him to pound-town
right about now.

27:21.525 --> 27:23.927
<i>Like a cheetah!</i>

27:28.299 --> 27:31.602
Yeah! Get him! Give him a...
Give him the-the Nelson!

27:31.635 --> 27:34.838
The full... Yeah!
Let's go.

27:40.444 --> 27:43.981
All right, now grab the body, take him down
in that little back room, that little cellar.

27:44.014 --> 27:46.283
<i>Yeah, make it quick.
We don't have much time.</i>

27:49.987 --> 27:53.624
<i>Dude, can you drag him any slower?
He's like the size of a child.</i>

27:53.658 --> 27:56.293
<i>Come on. Go, go, go.</i>

27:59.563 --> 28:01.398
<i>You're clear.</i>

28:09.640 --> 28:11.608
<i>All right, all right.
Now head west.</i>

28:11.642 --> 28:14.144
Go through the hall, all the way
down, third door on the right.

28:14.178 --> 28:16.513
Take that hallway down, two
lefts, and then another right.

28:16.547 --> 28:19.149
What the fuck?

28:19.183 --> 28:21.985
Marcus, you hear me?
Marcus! Shit!

28:22.019 --> 28:23.954
<i>Marcus, you hear...</i>

28:23.987 --> 28:27.891
- <i>Mar...</i>
- Auggy. Auggy, can you hear me?

28:27.925 --> 28:30.928
Marcus! Marcus!

28:30.961 --> 28:32.529
Shit!

28:33.530 --> 28:37.368
Shit! Fucking Auggy!

28:43.507 --> 28:46.377
I'm down. I'm fucked!

28:48.946 --> 28:52.249
Auggy! Where the fuck are you?

28:59.022 --> 29:02.526
- Auggy!
- Scott, is it clear down there?

29:02.559 --> 29:05.295
Clear at the safe entrance.

29:05.329 --> 29:07.064
Copy that.

29:18.409 --> 29:21.044
Auggy!
Auggy, where's the fucking safe?

29:21.078 --> 29:23.580
Come on! Come on, baby.
Let's go.

29:23.614 --> 29:26.483
What's going on?
Come on, come on, come on.

29:38.095 --> 29:41.598
Auggy, I found the safe.
What do I do?!

29:41.632 --> 29:43.967
Uh...

29:44.769 --> 29:47.371
Auggy.

29:54.344 --> 29:55.145
Huh!

30:00.217 --> 30:01.018
God!

30:02.619 --> 30:04.988
Come on, what... Yes!

30:05.022 --> 30:07.224
Marcus, you alive?
Marcus! You hear me?

30:07.257 --> 30:08.992
<i>I'm alive.
Where the hell were you?</i>

30:09.026 --> 30:10.461
Thought I lost you there
for a second there, buddy.

30:10.494 --> 30:12.196
You look so cute
when you struggle.

30:12.229 --> 30:14.666
- Nice timing, asshole!
- <i>I'm trying my best.</i>

30:14.699 --> 30:15.999
Okay, now, where's Margherita?

30:16.033 --> 30:17.134
Give me a clear shot, Marcus,

30:17.167 --> 30:18.202
I can't do this without it.

30:18.235 --> 30:21.104
I'm fucking trying!

30:21.138 --> 30:22.272
Ah!

30:23.240 --> 30:24.575
Come on, come on, come on.

30:24.608 --> 30:27.544
Come on, come on.

30:34.551 --> 30:36.754
Come on, Marcus.
All right, I got it.

30:36.788 --> 30:38.690
Let me put it in.

30:38.723 --> 30:42.226
Okay. It's almost there.
Five more seconds.

30:42.259 --> 30:44.995
I don't have five seconds,
Auggy.

30:45.797 --> 30:47.197
Got it!

30:48.599 --> 30:50.768
- It worked!
- Success!

30:50.802 --> 30:53.036
Whoo! Let's go!

30:53.070 --> 30:56.406
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- Never doubted you for a minute, buddy.

30:56.440 --> 31:00.177
<i>Oh, thank God. That big bag
strictly for confidence.</i>

31:36.280 --> 31:39.383
- Yeah?
- You're still alive.

31:40.350 --> 31:42.386
Does that mean the job is done?

31:42.419 --> 31:44.421
Yeah. I'm on my way to you.

31:44.454 --> 31:47.692
No, don't. You may have a tail.

31:50.327 --> 31:52.195
<i>Well, then,
where do you want me to go?</i>

31:52.229 --> 31:55.499
I'm gonna have someone meet you
in the mannequin warehouse

31:55.532 --> 31:58.368
next to the abandoned
Jormon building.

31:58.402 --> 32:00.404
Yeah, I know it.

32:00.437 --> 32:02.840
<i>You did good, Marcus.</i>

32:02.874 --> 32:05.777
Just don't forget
our fucking deal.

32:56.694 --> 32:59.196
Hey.

33:02.199 --> 33:06.470
Want to put your hands on
the wheel there for me, please?

33:10.607 --> 33:13.343
Detective, by the way.

33:15.713 --> 33:17.849
All right.

33:17.882 --> 33:20.250
Just get out of the car
for me, would ya, please?

33:20.283 --> 33:22.452
Come on. Slowly.

33:22.486 --> 33:24.354
Come on. Come on.

33:24.388 --> 33:26.658
Step out. Come on.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.627
Come on.

33:30.662 --> 33:33.196
Slowly.

33:33.230 --> 33:35.800
Move around to the back
of the vehicle, please.

33:37.334 --> 33:39.837
- Slow it down.
- Just calm down, Detective.

33:42.006 --> 33:44.742
Okay, hold it right there.

33:45.777 --> 33:47.679
Pop the trunk.

33:47.712 --> 33:50.213
Going slow.

33:54.952 --> 33:57.554
Well, well, well,
look at this.

33:57.587 --> 33:58.823
How about that?

34:02.392 --> 34:04.361
Put your hands behind your head.

34:04.394 --> 34:06.831
Come on, right now.

34:06.864 --> 34:09.331
<i>Amber City Police
Department, this is Officer Locke.</i>

34:09.366 --> 34:13.235
Locke, this is Dobbs.
Hey, I got a 2-17 in progress.

34:13.270 --> 34:16.674
2212 Western Avenue,
it's in the warehouse district.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.643
- Send somebody ASAP.
- <i>Right away, Detective.</i>

34:19.677 --> 34:20.978
Good deal.

34:22.679 --> 34:26.283
Got an old Beretta
right here, huh?

34:26.315 --> 34:29.687
How about that?
Safety's off too.

34:31.521 --> 34:34.424
- What the fuck?!
- How about that?

34:34.458 --> 34:39.664
Huh. I'm gonna clean this off a
little bit right now. Don't move.

34:39.697 --> 34:42.967
<i>All units, there's a
217 in progress at 2212 Western Avenue.</i>

34:43.000 --> 34:44.768
32 responding.

34:44.802 --> 34:46.904
- Let's go, 2-17, come on.
- What?

34:46.938 --> 34:49.371
Yeah, 2-17! Let's go!

34:50.742 --> 34:53.409
Where exactly do you intend
to go from here, Detective?

34:53.443 --> 34:56.480
Your prints
are all over this car,

34:56.513 --> 35:02.352
and there's a bullet from that
Beretta in poor Yuri right there.

35:02.385 --> 35:04.655
So I'm the fall guy here?

35:04.689 --> 35:08.391
You're a career thief,
you're not a saint.

35:08.425 --> 35:10.393
And, hey, it's nothing personal.

35:10.427 --> 35:12.462
I'm just cleaning up
some loose ends for Barren,

35:12.496 --> 35:15.332
including you and your sister.
If it's any consolation,

35:15.365 --> 35:17.334
Arkadi's guys are probably
gonna kill you.

35:17.367 --> 35:21.304
It's not like they can let the
murder of his son go unanswered.

35:21.338 --> 35:25.308
Come on, turn around.
Turn around! Come on!

35:29.513 --> 35:32.649
This is gonna look bad, Marcus.

35:33.017 --> 35:34.051
Oh, shit!

35:34.085 --> 35:36.586
Hey!

35:36.620 --> 35:39.456
Hey!

35:39.489 --> 35:41.525
Go check on Dobbs.
I'm after Marcus.

35:41.558 --> 35:44.695
- Motherfucker!
- Stop!

35:46.496 --> 35:47.698
Stop!

35:47.732 --> 35:49.700
Stop!

35:49.734 --> 35:51.669
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:51.702 --> 35:55.006
Holy shit. That's Yuri Dubkova.

35:55.605 --> 35:57.574
Go. Go!

35:59.043 --> 36:02.079
Fuck!

36:41.719 --> 36:43.087
What the fuck is this place?

36:43.120 --> 36:46.924
Where's my gun? Oh, shit.

37:02.472 --> 37:05.977
Blake, I didn't kill him, man.
I was set up.

37:06.010 --> 37:08.478
Yeah, except for
the dead body in your car.

37:08.511 --> 37:10.480
I didn't do it, man.
It was Dobbs. He's dirty!

37:10.513 --> 37:13.784
Really? Of all the names
you can possibly give me

37:13.818 --> 37:17.420
and fucking Dobbs is the one you
think I'm gonna believe is dirty?

37:17.454 --> 37:21.092
Blake. Think about it, man.
You know him better than anyone else.

37:21.125 --> 37:23.094
What does he have to lose?

37:23.127 --> 37:25.763
The only reason why I'm working
for Barren is to protect my sister.

37:25.796 --> 37:27.665
Bullshit.

37:29.532 --> 37:33.104
Blake, you know
I'm not a fucking liar.

37:41.112 --> 37:43.613
None of that matters now.
On your knees.

37:43.647 --> 37:45.783
I know you're not dumb.

37:45.816 --> 37:47.852
I said on your
fucking knees!

37:47.885 --> 37:51.488
What're you gonna do, huh?
You gonna kill a cop?

37:53.090 --> 37:54.692
Fuck this.

37:58.528 --> 38:01.933
Just remember how this could've
ended if I was a different man.

38:07.171 --> 38:09.073
Finning!

38:10.607 --> 38:12.209
Finning!

38:13.711 --> 38:16.013
Are you okay?

38:16.047 --> 38:18.716
What happened?
Where'd he go?

38:21.953 --> 38:25.488
- Dobbs?
- He's fine, he took off.

38:27.624 --> 38:29.526
Let's go.

38:44.909 --> 38:46.110
Where's Ray?

38:54.952 --> 38:57.688
- Ray?
- I'm back here.

39:02.893 --> 39:04.895
I fucked up.

39:06.297 --> 39:09.800
You know, sometimes I wonder,
is what I ask of people too much

39:09.834 --> 39:14.504
or are some people just
incapable of doing what I ask?

39:15.740 --> 39:18.142
It got complicated.

39:18.175 --> 39:22.612
Finning showed up
before we thought, and...

39:23.681 --> 39:25.648
I fucked up.

39:25.683 --> 39:30.788
I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed.

39:30.821 --> 39:32.622
You're my main guy.

39:32.656 --> 39:35.059
I have Boka
working on a contingency.

39:35.092 --> 39:40.898
Go to Arkadi and let him know
that Marcus killed Yuri.

39:50.074 --> 39:51.574
Yo, Reyna.

40:00.217 --> 40:01.786
I got her.

40:30.014 --> 40:31.215
Bring him in.

40:35.052 --> 40:36.253
Mr. Dubkova.

40:36.287 --> 40:40.324
- Arkadi Dubkova.
- Oh.

40:40.357 --> 40:43.861
Is there a chance
that we could speak privately?

40:46.330 --> 40:48.966
What did my son do now?

40:51.735 --> 40:54.171
- May I...
- Sit down.

40:54.205 --> 40:56.874
Thank you.

40:56.907 --> 40:59.910
You policemen are all alike.

40:59.944 --> 41:01.946
Same style.

41:01.979 --> 41:06.117
Guy's eating his supper,
by himself, the way he wants it,

41:06.150 --> 41:07.985
and you always interrupt him.

41:08.018 --> 41:11.322
I am so sorry, sir...

41:12.289 --> 41:14.058
Your son has been killed.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.062
My son?

41:18.095 --> 41:20.898
Yes, sir.

41:20.931 --> 41:23.267
You sure you
got the name right?

41:23.300 --> 41:25.269
Yes, sir.

41:31.842 --> 41:33.677
Sir...

41:35.179 --> 41:38.215
- I want a name.
- I can't give you a name.

41:38.249 --> 41:42.319
How much? How much?

41:42.353 --> 41:45.923
- Uh...
- How much money?

41:47.892 --> 41:50.461
I didn't come here
for the money.

41:50.494 --> 41:55.299
I came here
because I wanted to tell you.

41:55.332 --> 41:59.136
I lost my wife
two Christmases ago, all right?

41:59.170 --> 42:04.041
She passed before I had
a chance to say goodbye.

42:04.074 --> 42:07.311
Cancer took mine.

42:08.379 --> 42:11.348
You-you can't kill cancer.

42:11.382 --> 42:13.117
Really?

42:13.150 --> 42:16.453
And I should give a shit about
your wife died from cancer?

42:16.487 --> 42:19.423
You got a name,
and that's why I want a name,

42:19.456 --> 42:22.193
and you understand
that's why I want a name.

42:22.226 --> 42:26.130
So that's why one more time
I'll ask you, how fucking much?

42:31.435 --> 42:33.003
Do you have a pen?

42:41.912 --> 42:43.480
Thank you.

42:56.427 --> 42:59.263
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

43:01.098 --> 43:03.734
You know why
I appreciate this?

43:05.903 --> 43:07.938
Because you
didn't have to do it.

43:07.972 --> 43:13.877
And I'm sorry I said
what I said about your wife.

43:13.911 --> 43:16.447
But I actually
feel you care.

43:24.221 --> 43:27.391
How long
before I can see my son?

43:29.326 --> 43:33.030
Well, he'll be moved
to the morgue within the hour.

43:34.098 --> 43:35.933
So...

43:38.102 --> 43:40.471
You're done, sir.
Thank you.

43:40.504 --> 43:42.106
Thank you for this.

43:42.139 --> 43:45.476
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

43:50.948 --> 43:52.850
Sit down.

43:57.154 --> 44:01.592
One million dollars dead.

44:01.625 --> 44:05.195
Two million dollars alive.

44:06.864 --> 44:08.599
Now, go get it done.

44:08.632 --> 44:11.168
Yes, sir.

44:18.575 --> 44:21.111
Goddamn it!

44:32.523 --> 44:34.425
Come on, Reyna,
come on, come on. Pick up.

44:34.458 --> 44:36.293
Pick up.

44:39.496 --> 44:42.433
Come on, Reyna, please.
Please, pick up.

44:42.466 --> 44:45.102
<i>Hey, it's Reyna
Lombardi. I can't get to phone right now,</i>

44:45.135 --> 44:49.173
<i>but just leave me a message and
I'll call you back. Have a good one.</i>

44:49.206 --> 44:53.077
Reyna, it's me, Marcus.
Call me as soon as you get this.

44:59.049 --> 45:01.585
Marcus,
I was hoping you'd call.

45:01.618 --> 45:03.887
You set me up,
you motherfucker.

45:03.921 --> 45:07.891
Well, I just
needed to do something,

45:07.925 --> 45:09.893
and I had to get your sister
out of the equation.

45:09.927 --> 45:11.995
<i>You know, two birds, one stone.</i>

45:12.029 --> 45:13.665
<i>So I saw you
picked up your truck.</i>

45:13.698 --> 45:15.399
<i>You should've come inside,</i>

45:15.432 --> 45:17.201
<i>would've loved to see you.</i>

45:17.234 --> 45:20.537
I mean, you're the one
with Yuri's blood on your hands.

45:20.571 --> 45:25.042
When Arkadi finds out,
you'll be as good as dead.

45:25.075 --> 45:28.145
One less piece of the puzzle
I have to worry about.

45:28.178 --> 45:31.982
- Where's my sister?
- <i>She's alive for the moment.</i>

45:32.015 --> 45:34.084
I'll tell you what.

45:34.118 --> 45:38.255
Get me the case, and I'll make
sure her she stays that way.

45:38.288 --> 45:42.960
But you got to hurry.
Time's running out.

45:42.993 --> 45:44.261
<i>Ray!</i>

45:44.294 --> 45:47.264
Ray! Fuck!

45:48.599 --> 45:51.402
Think, think, think,
think, think...

46:34.211 --> 46:36.580
What is this?

46:39.583 --> 46:41.485
Auggy, it's Marcus. Let me in.

46:43.788 --> 46:46.256
Come on, it's me, man.
I know you're in there.

46:46.290 --> 46:49.359
I know! I got silent triggers
and hidden cameras everywhere.

46:49.393 --> 46:52.463
- I'm a genius, remember?
- Stop fucking around, man. Let me in.

46:52.496 --> 46:56.133
What did I tell you if shit went sideways?
I said you and I never met.

46:56.166 --> 47:01.104
Auggy, I'm gonna break your fucking door
down if you don't let me in right now!

47:01.138 --> 47:05.275
You will do no such thing.
Go away, Marcus.

47:07.144 --> 47:08.612
Okay.

47:12.416 --> 47:14.284
Holy shit! You broke
my fucking door down!

47:14.318 --> 47:16.086
I told you I was gonna
break your door down!

47:16.119 --> 47:17.321
Well, I hope you brought
new door money.

47:17.354 --> 47:19.323
I'm sorry, man.

47:19.356 --> 47:23.126
Listen, I just
really need your help.

47:23.160 --> 47:26.630
- Please.
- Fine. I'll help you.

47:26.664 --> 47:29.233
- Thanks, man.
- Just don't break any more of my shit. Please.

47:29.266 --> 47:32.135
I'm sorry, man.

47:32.169 --> 47:36.073
- I'm really sorry, man.
- You're like a bull in a china shop.

47:36.106 --> 47:38.275
What's up?

47:38.308 --> 47:41.545
Ray set me up,
man, that motherfucker.

47:41.578 --> 47:44.348
He framed me for the murder
of Arkadi's son and took Reyna.

47:44.381 --> 47:46.316
Shit. I figured
something was up.

47:46.350 --> 47:48.820
Arkadi put a massive bounty on your head.
It's all over the wire.

47:48.853 --> 47:51.221
- What?
- How much you think you're worth?

47:51.255 --> 47:54.458
- How much?
- A million dead, two million alive.

47:54.491 --> 47:57.594
- I almost took the job.
- Thanks.

47:57.628 --> 48:00.464
Dude, you are in
some massive shit right now.

48:00.497 --> 48:03.534
The hit's been out for less than an hour
and guess who's lobbying for your head.

48:03.567 --> 48:05.235
- Who?
- Ballista Grey.

48:05.269 --> 48:07.538
<i>I heard she once decapitated
a guy</i>

48:07.571 --> 48:10.240
<i>for stealing candy from a baby.</i>

48:10.274 --> 48:14.044
Hello, sister.

48:15.412 --> 48:16.413
Get on your knees.

48:16.446 --> 48:17.548
No, she didn't.

48:17.581 --> 48:18.615
Oh, yes.

48:18.649 --> 48:20.651
She is beautiful and deadly.

48:33.363 --> 48:36.868
Oh, and don't forget
Walt and Rudy Pachinko.

48:36.901 --> 48:39.837
You could say Walt is the brains,
while Rudy is definitely the brawn.

48:39.871 --> 48:41.873
<i>They'll do anything
for the buck.</i>

48:41.906 --> 48:45.409
<i>They're not the best,
but they get the job done.</i>

48:47.144 --> 48:48.713
This is gonna be
a big payday for us.

48:48.746 --> 48:50.414
Like shooting fish
in a barrel.

48:50.447 --> 48:52.817
I really like fish.

48:52.850 --> 48:56.821
I know you like fish, Rudy.
You're a Pisces.

48:56.854 --> 49:01.659
You take the three on the right,
I'll take the two on the left.

49:03.427 --> 49:07.631
- Grenade?
- I don't even wanna know where you kept that.

49:07.665 --> 49:10.534
They'd, like,
shoot your grandma on the cheap.

49:10.567 --> 49:12.804
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

49:14.404 --> 49:17.307
Go. Ears.

49:19.476 --> 49:22.179
- Grenade?
- Huh?

49:34.424 --> 49:38.763
And topping off the list,
a hitman that goes by the name of Phoenix.

49:38.796 --> 49:41.598
Ooh, he looks like
a tough son of a bitch.

49:41.632 --> 49:43.400
I mean, you gotta be
with a name like Phoenix, right?

49:43.433 --> 49:46.738
<i>Dude, this guy is like
the real life Jason Bourne.</i>

49:46.771 --> 49:49.339
<i>He's the guy all those hitman
movies are based on.</i>

49:49.373 --> 49:51.943
<i>This guy can kill you
with a gun, a knife, a brick,</i>

49:51.976 --> 49:56.346
<i>a bat with a rusty nail sticking out of
it, anything really.</i>

50:15.833 --> 50:19.269
- One.
- Hello, boys.

50:27.544 --> 50:31.783
I mean, with a list like this after
you, I'd start writing my eulogy now.

50:31.816 --> 50:35.519
Yeah? And who would show up?

50:35.552 --> 50:38.555
Ouch.
I would come, Marcus,

50:38.588 --> 50:41.458
if it didn't implicate me in
a major crime and mob cover-up.

50:41.491 --> 50:43.828
Besides, man, I can't leave.
They have Reyna.

50:43.861 --> 50:47.497
That's true. Look on the bright
side, man, no one knows you're here.

50:47.531 --> 50:49.801
Take a nice nap before you
engage in super murder kill hour.

50:49.834 --> 50:53.004
Auggy, I didn't come here to take a nap.
I need you to help me find her.

50:53.037 --> 50:55.873
Take it easy,
I'm not Houdini.

50:55.907 --> 50:59.276
Okay? I don't have a magic wand that
can just "poof" people into rooms.

51:03.513 --> 51:08.753
Auggy, you're the closest thing
I have to a friend, man.

51:08.786 --> 51:11.022
Are you just gonna
sit here and do nothing?

51:11.055 --> 51:13.858
I need you to help me
find her, please.

51:15.860 --> 51:19.296
I mean, I guess
as your best friend,

51:19.329 --> 51:20.832
I might be able
to find her location.

51:20.865 --> 51:24.301
If I can track the last
cell phone tower she pinged.

51:24.334 --> 51:27.370
Wait a second. I might be able to
do the same thing with Ray's phone.

51:27.404 --> 51:29.941
- Yeah.
- And that will help find her?

51:29.974 --> 51:32.309
I mean, it's something, man.
You'll still have to get clues

51:32.342 --> 51:34.377
and break her out of whatever
prison she's in, but...

51:34.411 --> 51:36.781
- Oh, that I can do. That's...
- That's right.

51:36.814 --> 51:39.349
- Extractor man to the rescue.
- Yeah.

51:39.382 --> 51:42.486
- Marcus.
- I know, I know. I don't know you if shit hits the fan.

51:42.519 --> 51:45.355
I was gonna say
be careful, man.

51:46.657 --> 51:48.793
Thanks, man.
Listen, I'm gonna run

51:48.826 --> 51:50.061
to Doc's real quick.

51:50.094 --> 51:51.595
I have an idea
that can speed this up.

51:51.628 --> 51:53.530
- Cool.
- Yeah.

51:53.563 --> 51:55.767
And, uh, I'll call you if I get
any more info on your sister.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.836
- And that's a big if.
- Thanks, man.

52:01.672 --> 52:04.474
- Just... careful.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got it.

52:04.508 --> 52:07.011
Yeah. Don't forget
my door money!

52:15.686 --> 52:18.488
Help me! Help me!

52:18.522 --> 52:22.292
Somebody help me! I'm in here!

52:23.828 --> 52:26.329
Okay, okay.

53:20.685 --> 53:22.519
Doc.

53:23.620 --> 53:25.388
Doc!

53:29.459 --> 53:31.595
Doc!

53:34.799 --> 53:36.801
Doc.

53:37.434 --> 53:38.703
Oh, shit.

53:38.736 --> 53:40.604
Doc.

53:40.637 --> 53:42.639
Oh, my God. Doc.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.642
Ow! What the fuck, man?!

53:45.676 --> 53:49.479
You fucked up my dream! Shit!

53:49.512 --> 53:51.916
What do ya need?
Want some fried bologna?

53:51.949 --> 53:54.118
No, I don't want
any fried bologna, Doc.

53:54.151 --> 53:56.020
Oh, my... mm.

53:56.053 --> 54:00.091
Listen, you still
have this place rigged up?

54:00.124 --> 54:02.193
What do I look like,
Chubsy Ubsy?

54:02.226 --> 54:05.930
Who the... Never mind.

54:05.963 --> 54:09.967
Hey, man, I got myself in a bit of a
situation, and I really need your help.

54:10.868 --> 54:12.569
Yeah, okay.

54:12.602 --> 54:14.171
Yeah? Just like that?
You're in?

54:14.205 --> 54:16.874
Yeah! I'm in the minute
you walked in, kid.

54:16.908 --> 54:20.011
I just gotta make
a phone call then.

54:20.044 --> 54:22.646
Do what you gotta do.

54:23.848 --> 54:26.616
The fuck don't know
who Chubsy Ubsy is?

54:26.650 --> 54:28.518
It's the fucking Little Rascals.

54:55.079 --> 54:58.950
Oh.

54:58.983 --> 55:01.852
Amber City Police Department,
this is Officer Locke. How may I help you?

55:01.886 --> 55:04.621
- Detective Finning.
- <i>Hold on one second, please.</i>

55:04.655 --> 55:07.758
Finning.

55:07.792 --> 55:10.194
- <i>It's Marcus.</i>
- What do you want, Marcus?

55:10.227 --> 55:13.230
Listen, I have something
that Ray wants.

55:13.264 --> 55:15.032
Now, I don't have time
to fuck around.

55:15.066 --> 55:17.068
I could sit here all day
and tell you that I was set up,

55:17.101 --> 55:19.036
but you would never believe me.

55:19.070 --> 55:21.772
- <i>Ray took my sister.</i>
- What do you mean he took her?

55:21.806 --> 55:23.975
Oh, don't act like you give a
shit about her all of a sudden.

55:24.008 --> 55:26.010
Oh, that's bullshit, Marcus,
and you know it.

55:26.043 --> 55:28.245
Then prove it.
Meet me tomorrow morning

55:28.279 --> 55:31.182
at 8:30 at the junkyard
off the old highway.

55:31.215 --> 55:32.817
<i>All I'm asking
is that you hear me out.</i>

55:32.850 --> 55:35.720
Whether you choose
to believe me or not,

55:35.753 --> 55:36.921
I'm yours to take in.

55:36.954 --> 55:39.190
Okay, Marcus.

55:39.223 --> 55:42.026
I'll be there at 8:30.

55:42.059 --> 55:46.629
But you fuck with me, I'm out.

55:57.341 --> 55:59.744
Evening, Dobbs.

56:09.353 --> 56:11.889
Hey. Was just coming
to get you.

56:11.922 --> 56:15.226
- What's up?
- Go get Walsh, Locke and Burke.

56:15.259 --> 56:18.295
Bring them in here, I gotta talk to
them, but keep it on the low.

56:18.329 --> 56:20.131
Please.

56:21.999 --> 56:25.269
- Uh...
- What?

56:25.302 --> 56:27.637
Burke.

56:27.671 --> 56:30.174
Locke, we need you.
Where's Walsh?

56:30.207 --> 56:31.842
Donuts.

56:32.943 --> 56:34.145
Hey! Walsh!

56:34.178 --> 56:35.312
- Hey.
- Come on.

56:35.346 --> 56:37.181
Oh, okay.

56:41.252 --> 56:43.254
Hey, donuts.

56:45.122 --> 56:50.560
What about "on the low"
did you not understand?

56:52.263 --> 56:53.831
What're you doing?

56:53.864 --> 56:56.633
It's donuts. Sorry.

56:56.667 --> 56:59.804
You okay? Okay, good.

57:02.673 --> 57:04.775
Now, I got a strange call
from Marcus Lombardi.

57:04.809 --> 57:06.977
The guy who killed
the Russian's kid?

57:07.011 --> 57:10.815
Yeah. He wants me to meet him at
the junkyard at Old Town Road.

57:10.848 --> 57:13.217
What for? You're not gonna
cooperate with this thug, are you?

57:13.250 --> 57:15.820
Deal with a thug?
He's the number one suspect.

57:15.853 --> 57:19.056
Yeah, we're gonna deal with the
thug, that's what we do, we're cops.

57:19.090 --> 57:21.225
I want to see what kind of intel
we can get out of him.

57:21.258 --> 57:23.828
- Does the captain know?
- No.

57:23.861 --> 57:25.729
And I don't want him to, okay?

57:25.763 --> 57:28.666
We have no idea
who's on Barren's payroll.

57:28.699 --> 57:31.402
Are you sure about this, Blake?

57:31.435 --> 57:35.272
I... I just know
that Marcus isn't a liar.

57:35.306 --> 57:39.143
- When's the meeting?
- 8:30 am.

57:41.412 --> 57:43.814
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

57:43.848 --> 57:45.349
On the low.

57:45.382 --> 57:47.885
Enjoy your donut.

58:17.982 --> 58:19.416
I'm in private.

58:23.921 --> 58:27.291
You passed that information
on to our people?

58:27.324 --> 58:29.760
- No, sir, I didn't.
- Why?

58:29.793 --> 58:31.896
I wanted to run it
by you first, sir.

58:31.929 --> 58:34.398
Well, did you think
that was what your job is?

58:34.431 --> 58:37.168
- Tell them right away?
- Yes, sir, it is.

58:37.201 --> 58:40.137
Why don't you go get it done?

58:40.171 --> 58:43.374
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

58:52.850 --> 58:54.318
Why?

59:10.834 --> 59:12.369
Doc, you got me?

59:12.403 --> 59:13.971
Yeah, kid.

59:15.539 --> 59:18.976
You got cops
coming in from the east.

59:19.009 --> 59:21.845
You got sensors
going off in the north

59:21.879 --> 59:26.884
And you got maybe one of your assassin
friends roaring in from the south.

59:26.917 --> 59:31.255
A mean looking one. She just took
out two of my cameras with knives.

59:31.288 --> 59:34.124
<i>Whatever you're gonna do,
kid, make it fast.</i>

59:34.158 --> 59:36.961
Make sure you get them
to the middle of the yard.

59:36.994 --> 59:39.530
This way, ya got
the upper hand. Capiche?

59:39.563 --> 59:42.132
<i>Copy that, Doc.
I'll do my best.</i>

59:42.166 --> 59:47.204
All right. Chop, chop.
Let's go. I ain't got all day.

01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:17.768
- About fucking time.
- What're you gonna do?

01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:22.106
I'm not saying shit
in front of him.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.478
It's all right,
I'll wait right here.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.002
Ray is obsessed
with this case I got for him.

01:00:52.036 --> 01:00:56.073
I don't know what's inside it, and to be
honest with you, I couldn't give a fuck less.

01:00:56.106 --> 01:00:59.877
The only thing I care about is to use the
case as leverage to get my sister back.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.512
We'll do the best job we can.

01:01:01.545 --> 01:01:04.848
- How do I know that?
- You don't.

01:01:04.882 --> 01:01:06.583
But we're your last option.

01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:09.987
Fine.

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.627
Cuff it to your wrist.
I'm serious.

01:01:16.661 --> 01:01:20.130
Cuff it to your fucking wrist. It does not
leave your hands until you get to the station.

01:01:20.164 --> 01:01:22.599
- Do I have to do this, Detective?
- Locke...

01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:26.637
Burke, you and Locke
take Dobbs back to the station.

01:01:26.671 --> 01:01:29.173
Walsh and I will follow.

01:01:29.206 --> 01:01:31.208
No stops.

01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:39.116
All right.

01:01:39.149 --> 01:01:43.387
Meet us down by the small road
by the junkyard.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.389
All right.

01:02:11.014 --> 01:02:13.517
- Where's Finning and Walsh?
- They're behind us.

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:16.954
Ah. That's what
we came for, yeah?

01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:20.391
- Yeah.
- This is a huge waste of time, if you ask me.

01:02:20.424 --> 01:02:22.092
The guy's a criminal,
simple as that.

01:02:22.126 --> 01:02:23.661
Yeah.

01:02:23.695 --> 01:02:25.329
Come on. Get in the car.
I'll drive.

01:02:25.362 --> 01:02:28.132
Yeah. The sooner we get
this off, the better, right?

01:02:28.165 --> 01:02:29.433
Yeah, come on.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.055
Cuff him.

01:03:12.476 --> 01:03:14.144
- Finning!
- Ah!

01:03:18.716 --> 01:03:20.718
I got you dead to rights.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.357
I'm here for Marcus Lombardi.
No one else needs to die.

01:03:34.298 --> 01:03:37.234
Tell that cop to drop his gun,
slide it in my direction.

01:03:37.267 --> 01:03:41.405
Walsh, put it down.

01:03:41.438 --> 01:03:43.006
I don't have time for this.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.408
Walsh, don't be fucking stupid!

01:03:44.441 --> 01:03:45.442
Put it down to help Finning.

01:03:45.476 --> 01:03:47.044
I got this!

01:03:58.489 --> 01:04:01.124
All right, hang on, hang on.

01:04:01.158 --> 01:04:03.560
- Get this thing off me!
- Here we go!

01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:10.434
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:14.571
Showtime.

01:04:16.473 --> 01:04:18.475
Move forward.

01:04:21.278 --> 01:04:24.348
You're worth more
to me alive, Marcus.

01:04:24.381 --> 01:04:25.717
I know.

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:45.135
Ready?

01:04:51.776 --> 01:04:55.078
Ah! I gotta get leverage!

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:59.416
- I got it, I got it.
- Hurry up!

01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:04.187
Watch your foot.

01:05:04.221 --> 01:05:06.557
All right.

01:05:10.728 --> 01:05:12.830
Come on!

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.764
Whoa! What the fuck?!

01:05:50.601 --> 01:05:53.470
Ah!

01:05:53.503 --> 01:05:55.505
We're wasting time here,
Marcus.

01:05:55.539 --> 01:05:58.542
I can break both your knee caps
and carry you out of here.

01:05:58.575 --> 01:06:00.678
I'll still collect
the two million.

01:06:00.712 --> 01:06:02.279
Ahh!

01:06:02.312 --> 01:06:04.716
Anything else to say?

01:06:04.749 --> 01:06:07.217
I stole your knife.

01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:18.128
So you're supposed
to be the best, huh?

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:29.439
I'm a little disappointed.

01:06:41.318 --> 01:06:43.453
Fucked him up.

01:06:44.956 --> 01:06:48.225
Didn't need this baby after all.

01:06:50.327 --> 01:06:52.797
Ah! Don't!

01:07:01.471 --> 01:07:03.941
What the fuck was that?

01:07:11.348 --> 01:07:12.917
I don't like this.

01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:16.788
You two stay here.

01:07:22.592 --> 01:07:24.796
Fuck

01:07:33.705 --> 01:07:35.740
Ray wanted to keep
a card up his sleeve,

01:07:35.773 --> 01:07:37.507
just in case you
couldn't come through.

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:41.879
Well, I appreciate
the assistance.

01:07:42.747 --> 01:07:45.850
I really do, but I got this.

01:07:45.883 --> 01:07:47.517
Ah!

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.975
Fuck, Dobbs!

01:08:12.777 --> 01:08:14.712
This whole mess is your fault
because you couldn't

01:08:14.746 --> 01:08:16.013
keep Finning at bay.

01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:21.051
You got sloppy, Dobbs.

01:08:21.085 --> 01:08:22.787
You got too soft.

01:08:24.421 --> 01:08:25.488
Once Finning gave us the case,

01:08:25.522 --> 01:08:29.026
there was really
no need for you.

01:08:38.803 --> 01:08:41.671
It's just business, Dobbs.

01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:43.340
But it's also a little personal.

01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:47.377
I hope the money is worth it.

01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:51.048
Finning's a wrecking ball.

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:53.649
He won't stop
till he gets what he wants.

01:08:53.684 --> 01:08:57.889
He'll have his hands full.

01:08:57.921 --> 01:09:00.992
Boka, let's go.

01:09:01.024 --> 01:09:03.393
You know, it's funny...

01:09:03.426 --> 01:09:06.563
how some things just...
work out.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.803
Have fun dying, Dobbs.

01:09:17.942 --> 01:09:20.011
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:20.044 --> 01:09:22.379
I gotta call Dobbs.

01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:24.346
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:26.984
He's not picking up.

01:09:27.018 --> 01:09:28.551
Try Burke.

01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:31.856
Here.

01:09:33.825 --> 01:09:35.660
Fuck.

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:40.698
Come on, Burke.

01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:42.867
<i>This is Ellen Burke.
Leave me a message.</i>

01:09:44.836 --> 01:09:46.837
What the fuck was that?

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:51.075
An assassin. Arkadi put
a bounty on my head.

01:09:51.108 --> 01:09:53.877
- Oh, 'cause of Yuri?
- Is he dead?

01:09:53.911 --> 01:09:55.713
Very.

01:09:57.748 --> 01:09:59.050
How many more?

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:01.853
I don't know,
two, possibly three.

01:10:01.886 --> 01:10:03.788
Grab this fucking guy.
We gotta get to the station.

01:10:03.821 --> 01:10:06.389
Goddamn it!

01:10:16.901 --> 01:10:18.769
Bingo.

01:10:39.991 --> 01:10:42.159
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

01:10:42.193 --> 01:10:46.463
Whoa. Things just got
a little more interesting.

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:49.667
I haven't had a blade this close
since '82, sweetheart.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.738
And she bought me dinner first.
Take it easy.

01:10:55.239 --> 01:10:57.041
Phoenix?

01:10:57.074 --> 01:10:59.542
Yeah. He's dead.

01:10:59.576 --> 01:11:02.612
So, what're you gonna do? Huh?
What're you gonna do?

01:11:02.646 --> 01:11:03.881
You gonna
use this thing or what?

01:11:03.915 --> 01:11:05.983
I'm not gonna kill you,
old man.

01:11:06.017 --> 01:11:07.685
- Hey.
- But I am gonna use you.

01:11:07.718 --> 01:11:10.553
I'm not that old.

01:11:10.587 --> 01:11:14.859
All right, all right.
Take it easy.

01:11:39.951 --> 01:11:43.120
- Officer Burke.
- Barren.

01:11:43.154 --> 01:11:45.957
I see you have my case.

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.624
You got the payment?

01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:51.662
Don't I always?

01:11:51.696 --> 01:11:56.233
Next time you need another inside guy, can you
make sure he doesn't develop a conscience?

01:11:56.267 --> 01:11:57.935
I don't like having
to clean up in-house messes.

01:11:57.969 --> 01:12:01.005
But you do it so well.

01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:03.874
- Right now, I'm all you've got.
- Hm.

01:12:03.908 --> 01:12:06.143
So you should remember that.

01:12:09.546 --> 01:12:12.649
Good luck opening it,
didn't come with a key.

01:12:12.683 --> 01:12:18.656
You know, the Russians are so cheap
when it comes to the small details.

01:12:20.758 --> 01:12:22.226
The keys from the other case.

01:12:23.127 --> 01:12:26.197
If this doesn't work,

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:30.234
a well-placed bullet
should do the trick.

01:12:42.313 --> 01:12:44.281
You gotta love the Russians.

01:12:44.315 --> 01:12:49.220
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you, Barren.

01:12:49.253 --> 01:12:52.289
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.525
The pleasure is all mine.

01:12:59.263 --> 01:13:01.332
Trust me. It's all there.

01:13:01.365 --> 01:13:04.068
You can never be too sure.

01:13:11.742 --> 01:13:16.180
- You can't kill a cop.
- No? Just watch me.

01:13:16.213 --> 01:13:19.750
All this chaos
for two small pieces of silver.

01:13:19.784 --> 01:13:22.953
Money can make people
do strange things.

01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:24.989
Just like the rug,
I bought it just for you.

01:13:25.022 --> 01:13:27.091
Just get it over with!

01:13:27.124 --> 01:13:29.760
People are so easy.

01:13:29.794 --> 01:13:32.696
You just have to know
what buttons to push.

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.899
Yours was greed.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:36.901
Your price was too high.

01:13:36.934 --> 01:13:39.970
And you think
too much of yourself.

01:13:41.238 --> 01:13:46.210
Now you're gonna realize
what you're really worth.

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.021
Boka.

01:13:59.256 --> 01:14:01.392
Clean up this mess.

01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:06.363
And, uh, Marcus' sister,
take care of her.

01:14:06.397 --> 01:14:08.199
Got it.

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:28.385
Hey!

01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:30.821
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Doc, are you okay?

01:14:30.855 --> 01:14:34.391
Am I okay? I haven't been
this excited since '95.

01:14:34.425 --> 01:14:36.626
Let me guess, another one
of your fucking friends?

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:40.630
Hey, what are you doing?

01:14:41.765 --> 01:14:43.801
Just trust me.

01:14:45.002 --> 01:14:46.871
No one else
is dying because of me.

01:14:53.777 --> 01:14:55.379
Let him go,
and I'll go with you.

01:14:56.447 --> 01:14:58.249
You don't look like much,

01:14:58.282 --> 01:15:00.918
but you handled
Phoenix pretty fast.

01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:02.786
He always did get the best hits.

01:15:04.288 --> 01:15:06.924
Well, this is awkward.

01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:11.028
Can I go? 'Cause I got business
to attend at the trailer.

01:15:13.964 --> 01:15:17.268
You two should come with me because
things are about to get crazy.

01:15:17.301 --> 01:15:20.037
- We're good here.
- Just go with him.

01:15:22.173 --> 01:15:24.708
I've never had cops
in my trailer.

01:15:24.742 --> 01:15:27.211
This should be interesting.

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.251
So how do you
want to play this?

01:15:34.285 --> 01:15:36.220
It's your call.

01:15:36.253 --> 01:15:38.389
But one way or another,
I'm taking you in.

01:15:38.422 --> 01:15:40.191
You have the wrong guy.

01:15:40.224 --> 01:15:42.459
The money's telling me
I've got the right guy.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.364
Doc! Doc!

01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:25.135
Yeah, yeah, we're here, we're here.
Hold your horses. All right.

01:16:26.036 --> 01:16:29.373
Fuck!

01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:36.947
Well, it looks like we're a little
late for the party, brother.

01:16:38.282 --> 01:16:41.552
You know, I fancy myself
a reasonable individual.

01:16:41.585 --> 01:16:43.821
So as a professional courtesy,

01:16:43.854 --> 01:16:46.423
I'm gonna give you one chance
to hand him over to us.

01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:51.195
Before I let my brother here
squish your head like a grape.

01:16:54.198 --> 01:16:57.034
Sorry, boys, he's mine.

01:16:57.067 --> 01:17:00.938
I was hoping you were gonna say that.

01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:04.541
Now, do me a favor
and go step on that tomato.

01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:07.077
Did you know the tomato
is a fruit, Walt?

01:17:07.111 --> 01:17:11.048
I know tomatoes are fruit, Rudy!
I know!

01:17:11.081 --> 01:17:14.218
Now, she's the tomato,
go stomp on that tomato.

01:17:14.251 --> 01:17:15.953
Oh!

01:17:15.986 --> 01:17:20.057
Whoo! Whoo!

01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:23.861
Doc, now's a good time
for that show.

01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:27.164
- Anytime, Doc. Anytime now!
- Yeah, yea, yeah, yeah.

01:17:27.197 --> 01:17:29.133
This better work.

01:17:32.136 --> 01:17:33.871
You know I love the thrill
of the hunt,

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:35.906
but are you really gonna
make me chase you, Marcus?

01:17:53.524 --> 01:17:55.993
Whoo!

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.304
- Anytime now, Doc.
- It's about time to show off your talents, Betsy-girl.

01:18:07.338 --> 01:18:10.507
Here we go. Stay behind a car
because it's gonna get loud.

01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:12.876
Wait. That's your plan?
To blow everybody up?

01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:16.447
Hey, hey. Yes, Detective.
Come on.

01:18:18.415 --> 01:18:20.351
Shit!

01:18:20.384 --> 01:18:22.319
Son of a bitch!

01:18:22.353 --> 01:18:24.088
This shit ain't working.

01:18:24.121 --> 01:18:25.589
What do you mean
it's not working?

01:18:25.622 --> 01:18:27.257
I don't know.
It's been sitting too long.

01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:30.627
Man, I got a trip wire
in the car pit

01:18:30.662 --> 01:18:32.429
with a bunch of explosives.

01:18:32.463 --> 01:18:34.932
Lead them there and then get
the fuck out of there, quickly.

01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:37.167
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Copy that, Doc.

01:18:37.201 --> 01:18:41.438
- How's the bologna?
- Oh, it's very good. Thank you.

01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:49.113
You know...
I could just kill you.

01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:54.351
A million bucks is a lot
of pizza bucks for Rudy.

01:19:16.106 --> 01:19:17.574
Shit!

01:19:23.313 --> 01:19:26.517
Walt? Walt!

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.189
Brother! Are you okay?

01:19:32.222 --> 01:19:34.224
I'm fine!

01:19:34.258 --> 01:19:36.160
Did you squash the tomato?

01:19:36.193 --> 01:19:40.030
I lost the tomato.
She rolled away.

01:19:40.063 --> 01:19:43.066
Get your ass over here,
he's getting away!

01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:49.039
Brother, are you okay?

01:19:53.343 --> 01:19:54.645
That way!

01:20:05.456 --> 01:20:08.025
Oh, shit!

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:13.597
- You're not taking me in.
- Watch me.

01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:19.737
Come on, Walt. Come on, Walt.

01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:21.739
Come on, Walt.

01:20:30.782 --> 01:20:33.150
- Walter?
- Rudolph.

01:20:33.183 --> 01:20:34.551
Fuck!

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.745
Ah!

01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:17.695
Nothing personal.

01:21:39.784 --> 01:21:43.287
Oh!

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.056
Look who it is!

01:21:48.726 --> 01:21:50.527
You're not dead, kid!

01:21:50.561 --> 01:21:54.598
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:57.334
- What do we do with her?
- I'll take care of her.

01:21:57.367 --> 01:21:59.671
- Oh?
- Yeah, don't worry. I'll hold the fort.

01:21:59.704 --> 01:22:03.507
You guys finish whatever convoluted
adventure you were on. Go on.

01:22:06.643 --> 01:22:08.478
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:22:08.512 --> 01:22:10.715
Wait, wait.
What about my car?

01:22:10.748 --> 01:22:13.150
Take his car.

01:22:13.183 --> 01:22:15.152
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:17.722
- Good luck, kid.
- Thanks, Doc.

01:22:17.755 --> 01:22:21.592
All right. Good job.

01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:23.695
Just me and you, darling.

01:22:40.544 --> 01:22:42.312
Where the fuck is the case?

01:22:42.346 --> 01:22:45.649
Locke is dead,
the case is gone.

01:22:45.683 --> 01:22:47.184
What the fuck happened?

01:22:48.352 --> 01:22:51.221
Blake, I'm part of this.

01:22:51.254 --> 01:22:52.724
I-I bugged Ray.

01:22:52.757 --> 01:22:57.561
Burke is part of it too.
She has the case.

01:22:57.594 --> 01:23:01.431
Blake, I don't have time for this shit,
my sister's in danger! I got to go!

01:23:01.465 --> 01:23:04.568
Shut the fuck up.
I've had enough.

01:23:04.601 --> 01:23:07.604
You want to shoot me?
Fucking shoot me, Blake!

01:23:07.638 --> 01:23:09.272
Do it!

01:23:10.808 --> 01:23:15.913
The tapes are behind
Annie's plate at the mausoleum.

01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:19.249
Your sister... Rey...

01:23:19.282 --> 01:23:20.718
Balboa...

01:23:20.752 --> 01:23:23.121
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:23:26.991 --> 01:23:28.760
I'm sorry.

01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:33.296
Call it in.

01:23:36.734 --> 01:23:39.871
This is Detective Walsh.
I have two officers down,

01:23:39.904 --> 01:23:41.873
Locke and Dobbs.

01:23:41.906 --> 01:23:45.509
About a quarter mile
west of I-42...

01:23:47.511 --> 01:23:49.714
I'm sorry.

01:23:52.016 --> 01:23:54.551
I'm so sorry.

01:23:57.989 --> 01:24:00.958
Shit won't come out.

01:24:00.992 --> 01:24:05.730
It went back in. Jesus.
Gotta relax.

01:24:10.935 --> 01:24:15.405
Here we go! Now we gotta open
the fucking window.

01:24:15.439 --> 01:24:18.275
Ooh! Smells like gasoline
in here.

01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:20.978
Gotcha.

01:24:29.954 --> 01:24:32.289
What the fuck, Houdini?

01:24:33.323 --> 01:24:34.558
It's all right.

01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:36.293
He's all right.

01:24:36.326 --> 01:24:38.796
He'll be all right.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.699
Five minutes
till <i>Bachelor in Paradise.</i>

01:24:58.916 --> 01:25:01.518
Oh, baby.

01:25:15.465 --> 01:25:17.467
Gotcha.

01:25:18.368 --> 01:25:20.037
Thanks, Annie.

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:38.723
<i>Dobbs, throw Yuri in the
trunk of the car and get Marcus.</i>

01:25:38.756 --> 01:25:41.058
<i>Once Marcus gives you the case,</i>

01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:44.695
<i>we'll kill Yuri
and frame Marcus for it.</i>

01:25:44.729 --> 01:25:47.031
That motherfucker.

01:25:50.968 --> 01:25:52.804
Hey, what's up, man?

01:25:52.837 --> 01:25:54.906
You been sitting there too long,
man, you can't stay there.

01:25:54.939 --> 01:25:56.774
No, no, listen, I'm sorry.
Can you just tell me

01:25:56.808 --> 01:25:59.076
- where Sarkisian Street is?
- I don't care, man.

01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:00.577
You got to move your car,
you can't stay there.

01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:02.512
Oh, come on, man,
can you just tell me

01:26:02.546 --> 01:26:03.981
- where Sarkisian Street is?
- It's probably over there!

01:26:04.015 --> 01:26:06.017
- But you cannot leave... Ah!
- There?

01:26:07.651 --> 01:26:09.987
Ahh!

01:26:11.756 --> 01:26:13.758
Ah!

01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:15.625
How many are there?

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.663
- Ah!
- How many?

01:26:18.696 --> 01:26:22.667
It's just me, man.
It's just me.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.836
Take me to my sister.

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:34.011
You want to fuck
with my family? Huh?

01:26:34.045 --> 01:26:36.914
Motherfucker.
I'm gonna kill all of you.

01:26:58.169 --> 01:27:00.370
Couldn't make this easy,
could you?

01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:33.938
Where's Reyna?

01:27:33.971 --> 01:27:36.674
You... you shot me.

01:27:36.707 --> 01:27:39.777
Bobby, where the fuck
is my sister?

01:27:41.712 --> 01:27:44.081
- I'll show you.
- Yeah, you will.

01:27:54.491 --> 01:27:56.727
- Stay away from me!
- Reyna!

01:27:58.528 --> 01:27:59.964
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:27:59.997 --> 01:28:01.966
- Put your shoe on.
- Okay.

01:28:05.803 --> 01:28:07.604
Bobby?

01:28:08.873 --> 01:28:10.207
Here, get behind me.

01:28:19.649 --> 01:28:22.119
Grab this! Grab this!
Run back to my place! Go!

01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:03.995
He went this way.
Let's go!

01:29:04.028 --> 01:29:06.496
Come on, come on, come on!

01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:47.738
Fuck!

01:29:52.076 --> 01:29:53.944
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:30:14.365 --> 01:30:16.566
Ah!

01:31:19.096 --> 01:31:21.165
You look like you've been busy.

01:31:22.233 --> 01:31:26.670
- Doc?
- He's alive.

01:31:29.206 --> 01:31:31.442
You want to take me in,
but that's not gonna happen.

01:31:31.475 --> 01:31:34.044
Do you really want
to die today?

01:31:34.078 --> 01:31:36.814
Don't you have something
more to live for?

01:31:38.749 --> 01:31:41.919
We can do this your way
if you want, but just remember,

01:31:41.952 --> 01:31:44.922
it hasn't worked out great for the
others, or we can do it my way.

01:31:48.492 --> 01:31:50.060
I'm listening.

01:31:51.362 --> 01:31:53.731
I have to go
in to Arkadi's alone.

01:31:53.764 --> 01:31:57.067
That is the only way I can clear my name.
Now, listen to me.

01:31:57.101 --> 01:32:01.839
I promise you,
I will get you your money.

01:32:06.277 --> 01:32:08.312
You have a week.

01:32:08.345 --> 01:32:10.181
If I don't have
that money by then,

01:32:10.214 --> 01:32:14.018
I will find you
and we can finish this my way.

01:32:15.853 --> 01:32:17.388
Deal.

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:49.119
Detective Finning.

01:32:50.988 --> 01:32:53.357
To what do I owe this honor?

01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:56.260
We need to talk.

01:32:56.293 --> 01:32:58.829
You look like
you're living in a dumpster.

01:33:00.931 --> 01:33:03.100
Can I offer you
something to drink?

01:33:03.133 --> 01:33:06.136
I've got some
really good whiskey.

01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:08.439
Macallan, single malt.

01:33:09.206 --> 01:33:11.041
Got a new rug, Ray?

01:33:12.209 --> 01:33:15.145
Yep, the other got soiled.

01:33:16.247 --> 01:33:18.482
I had to get rid of it.

01:33:18.515 --> 01:33:21.151
How's it feel?

01:33:21.185 --> 01:33:23.087
How's what feel?

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.989
Knowing this could be
your last free breath.

01:33:25.022 --> 01:33:30.261
The wisdom of uncertainty.

01:33:30.294 --> 01:33:32.930
In there lies the truth.

01:33:32.963 --> 01:33:37.001
Hey, listen, Finning.

01:33:38.135 --> 01:33:41.505
Before you start
with all your accusations,

01:33:41.538 --> 01:33:43.207
let me give you a tour.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:47.344
You know, I'm sure you're-you're
dying to look around.

01:33:47.378 --> 01:33:52.850
Nothing but some-some gaming tables
and the smell of dancing ladies.

01:33:54.518 --> 01:33:57.121
Hm? It's all legal.

01:33:57.154 --> 01:33:59.823
I've got permits.

01:33:59.857 --> 01:34:02.893
Come on. Come on.

01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:10.100
The funny thing is...
I really like you, Blake.

01:34:10.134 --> 01:34:12.303
Do you mind me
calling you Blake?

01:34:12.336 --> 01:34:15.005
I like you
because you're simple.

01:34:15.039 --> 01:34:17.408
Like how I offered
to give you a tour,

01:34:17.441 --> 01:34:21.111
and at the same time managed to
walk you right through to the exit.

01:34:22.279 --> 01:34:25.516
Well, thanks
for stopping by, Detective.

01:34:25.549 --> 01:34:28.819
I enjoyed
every moment of it.

01:34:30.287 --> 01:34:32.556
By the way...

01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:35.292
I'm sorry about your partner.

01:34:35.326 --> 01:34:38.062
There's one more thing, Ray.

01:34:38.095 --> 01:34:40.631
Scout's honor?

01:34:40.665 --> 01:34:43.167
Remember that case you caught?

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.303
Turns out you violated
all sorts of laws,

01:34:46.337 --> 01:34:49.273
including framing
an innocent man,

01:34:49.306 --> 01:34:53.877
and multiple...
multiple cases of murder.

01:34:53.911 --> 01:34:57.614
Sounds like
a conspiracy theory to me.

01:34:57.648 --> 01:35:00.451
You're a great
manipulator, Ray.

01:35:00.484 --> 01:35:02.419
You get those people
that are desperate,

01:35:02.453 --> 01:35:05.889
or you threaten
their families.

01:35:05.923 --> 01:35:08.992
You know, then you
have them do your bidding.

01:35:09.026 --> 01:35:11.528
Then you just fucking
toss them aside.

01:35:11.562 --> 01:35:14.531
The problem with that way
of thinking, Ray,

01:35:14.565 --> 01:35:18.602
is that eventually one of them

01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:23.340
is smart enough to realize
what the end game is.

01:35:23.374 --> 01:35:28.545
So they start doing things
like bugging your office.

01:35:28.579 --> 01:35:31.615
Gathering evidence
when you're not around.

01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:36.453
You know, like a...
like an insurance policy.

01:35:36.487 --> 01:35:39.423
And then when they're
laying on their death bed

01:35:39.456 --> 01:35:44.027
from the bullet
that you put in them,

01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:46.930
and they ask you to lean in

01:35:46.964 --> 01:35:50.200
so they can tell you all
their dirty little secrets...

01:35:52.636 --> 01:35:55.305
The bullet
you in my partner...

01:35:56.573 --> 01:35:59.610
- sealed your fate.
- Hm.

01:36:03.447 --> 01:36:08.452
Ray Barren, you are under arrest
for corruption, fraud, and murder.

01:36:08.485 --> 01:36:11.021
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:36:11.522 --> 01:36:13.557
This ain't over.

01:36:26.603 --> 01:36:29.306
Oh, Reyna! Thank God.

01:36:29.339 --> 01:36:31.442
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:36:31.475 --> 01:36:35.345
- Oh, my God. Is it over?
- It is for you.

01:36:35.379 --> 01:36:38.683
- What?
- Listen to me, listen to me.

01:36:38.716 --> 01:36:42.352
I just got to do one more thing
and we'll be safe. Reyna.

01:36:42.386 --> 01:36:46.256
- I promise you. Okay?
- Okay.

01:36:46.290 --> 01:36:49.059
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:54.331
- Okay.
- Hey. Just do me a favor.

01:36:54.364 --> 01:36:57.000
Don't open the door
for anyone. Okay?

01:36:57.034 --> 01:37:00.738
- Okay.
- Be careful.

01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:40.043
Thank you, sir.

01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.662
Oh...

01:38:00.665 --> 01:38:04.201
Oof.
What happened to your nose?

01:38:05.569 --> 01:38:07.304
You don't want to know.

01:38:08.372 --> 01:38:10.507
So you're my son's killer.

01:38:10.541 --> 01:38:13.343
No, sir.

01:38:13.377 --> 01:38:15.445
You remind me of a story.

01:38:15.479 --> 01:38:18.549
Have you ever heard the story
of Vasilli the Unfortunate?

01:38:18.582 --> 01:38:21.753
Enlighten me.

01:38:21.786 --> 01:38:26.290
Vasilli was
the seventh of eight

01:38:26.323 --> 01:38:30.627
of a very poor farmer
out in the country.

01:38:30.662 --> 01:38:33.497
And the king of all that area

01:38:33.530 --> 01:38:40.504
decided to give all
of his riches to the farmer.

01:38:40.537 --> 01:38:44.374
And the king decided

01:38:44.408 --> 01:38:47.611
that he wanted to be
the guardian of Vasilli.

01:38:49.681 --> 01:38:55.285
So after the king had given all
of his riches to the poor farmer,

01:38:55.319 --> 01:38:59.189
he didn't think
he made the right decision.

01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:02.392
And he was unhappy about it.

01:39:03.527 --> 01:39:06.430
So he took Vasilli
to the edge of the cliff

01:39:06.463 --> 01:39:11.234
overlooking the big harbor...
and pushed him off.

01:39:12.904 --> 01:39:15.472
But this is the luckiest prick
you ever knew.

01:39:15.505 --> 01:39:20.712
Because he fell
in a fishermen's boat.

01:39:20.745 --> 01:39:23.715
The fisherman's name
was Marco.

01:39:23.748 --> 01:39:27.317
And all Marco did was he
kept trying to kill Vasilli

01:39:27.351 --> 01:39:30.722
again and again and again.

01:39:30.755 --> 01:39:33.123
And he couldn't do it.

01:39:34.424 --> 01:39:38.161
And the sickest thing
about it is...

01:39:38.195 --> 01:39:41.933
the son of a bitch kept
coming back again and again

01:39:41.966 --> 01:39:45.737
because he didn't know
what else to do.

01:39:47.504 --> 01:39:51.843
Now what can I do for you,
my Vasilli?

01:39:53.377 --> 01:39:57.682
Sir, I didn't kill your son.

01:39:57.715 --> 01:40:01.385
And why should I believe a man

01:40:01.418 --> 01:40:05.455
that I've paid a good deal
of money to have killed?

01:40:08.558 --> 01:40:11.963
At the end of Vasilli's story,

01:40:11.996 --> 01:40:17.200
he uncovers an oak tree
and discovers riches.

01:40:18.301 --> 01:40:20.637
<i>Dobbs,</i>

01:40:20.672 --> 01:40:24.241
<i>throw Yuri in the trunk
of the car and get Marcus.</i>

01:40:24.274 --> 01:40:26.678
<i>Once Marcus
gives you the case,</i>

01:40:26.711 --> 01:40:31.248
<i>we'll kill Yuri
and frame Marcus for it.</i>

01:40:34.886 --> 01:40:38.221
Your son was working
with Barren.

01:40:38.255 --> 01:40:42.626
He wanted to cut you out to prove
to you that he can be his own man.

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:45.362
Unfortunately for Yuri,

01:40:45.395 --> 01:40:48.598
Barren doesn't
play well with others.

01:40:49.801 --> 01:40:52.970
Ray is incarcerated, but, um...

01:40:53.004 --> 01:40:55.707
that shouldn't be
a problem for you.

01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:59.911
And what might
a person have to pay

01:40:59.944 --> 01:41:02.412
for that information?

01:41:03.681 --> 01:41:05.415
I want my name cleared...

01:41:05.983 --> 01:41:08.452
and my bounty.

01:41:08.485 --> 01:41:12.255
I've brought you
Marcus Lombardi alive.

01:41:12.289 --> 01:41:14.659
Sure.

01:41:16.728 --> 01:41:18.996
Do we have a deal?

01:41:25.069 --> 01:41:28.906
Barney. Bag.

01:41:43.888 --> 01:41:46.256
How does it look to you?

01:41:47.759 --> 01:41:49.727
Like a new beginning.

01:41:51.763 --> 01:41:54.264
A deal's a deal.

01:41:55.066 --> 01:41:57.869
Don't go poetic on me.

01:42:11.082 --> 01:42:16.721
I gave a guy with a limp
a gazillion dollars.

01:42:16.754 --> 01:42:19.623
Am I an asshole or what?

01:42:55.392 --> 01:42:58.595
- Hey! Oh!
- Hi.

01:42:58.628 --> 01:43:01.899
- I'm so sorry we're late.
- It's okay. She sleeping?

01:43:01.933 --> 01:43:04.634
Yeah, she slept
the whole way here.

01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:08.605
I mean,
traffic was just terrible.

01:43:08.638 --> 01:43:10.875
Don't even worry about it.

01:43:10.908 --> 01:43:13.911
I've got all the time
in the world.

01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:23.587
Look at this. Sonny boy
knows what he's doing, right?

01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.388
Right?

01:43:25.422 --> 01:43:27.524
You know what I mean, Lumpy?

01:43:27.557 --> 01:43:30.493
That's why you
help your friends out.

01:43:30.527 --> 01:43:32.964
I don't fuck around.

01:43:32.997 --> 01:43:35.066
Look at this shit.

01:43:35.099 --> 01:43:39.737
- We got it. Home free.
- Thank you so much. Have a nice day.

01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:42.639
Hello, welcome to Crossroads Cafe.
How can I help you?

01:43:42.673 --> 01:43:45.542
I got it, I...

01:43:45.575 --> 01:43:48.079
- What?
- What?

01:43:48.112 --> 01:43:49.714
That's how you're
gonna talk to your brother?

01:43:49.747 --> 01:43:51.414
What do you want?

01:43:51.448 --> 01:43:54.417
- How 'bout that free food?
- No.
