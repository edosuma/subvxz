They gave me a ride home.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.857

that anyone
from Cornell dated you.

not a lot of money
in the arts, right?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.776
That's not really true.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.070
There's a lot of things
you can do with
an art degree, actually.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.696
Maybe Pam should
pay the check

12:19.781 --> 12:22.116

on this napkin.

should l join?

13:25.555 --> 13:29.224
The Harmoniacs?
Or the Do-Re-Migos?

13:31.227 --> 13:35.981
Assuming you had the voice
to be in any of them,
it's irrelevant,

13:36.065 --> 13:38.150
because l called admissions
and it looks like

13:38.234 --> 13:41.528
l will be conducting
your university interview.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.322

of interest.

Yeah. Big one.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.367
So should l not
let you in now?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.620
Or do you want to
do the interview

13:49.704 --> 13:51.455

l won't let you in?

put Dwight's chances

none percent chance.
