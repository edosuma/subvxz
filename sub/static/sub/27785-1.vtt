01:35.600 --> 01:39.617
Mrs. Teasdale? - Yes, Your Excellency?
- I again ask you to reconsider.

01:39.804 --> 01:44.251
Gentlemen, I've already loaned
Freedonia over half my fortune.

01:44.475 --> 01:49.918
I consider that money lost, and now
you're asking for another $20 million.

01:50.982 --> 01:53.340
Only to meet this present emergency.

01:53.568 --> 01:57.018
With $20 million, we can announce
a reduction in taxes.

01:57.238 --> 02:01.270
That's all the people ask.
- I'm inclined to agree with them.

02:01.492 --> 02:03.732
The government has been mismanaged.
- What?

02:03.953 --> 02:09.229
I will lend the money, but only
if His Excellency withdraws.

02:09.459 --> 02:13.324
You ask me to give up my office?
- Yes. In a crisis like this,

02:13.546 --> 02:17.329
Freedonia needs a new leader,
a progressive fighter,

02:17.550 --> 02:19.743
a man like Rufus T. Firefly!

02:19.969 --> 02:22.043
Rufus T. Firefly!

02:22.263 --> 02:26.876
I'll lend the money to Freedonia,
only if Firefly is appointed leader!

02:50.375 --> 02:54.074
The Honorable Secretary
of Finance and Parking!

03:03.179 --> 03:07.424
His Excellency,
Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania!

03:14.857 --> 03:17.216
Ambassador.
- Mrs. Teasdale.

03:18.361 --> 03:22.096
I'm anxious for you to meet
our new leader.

03:22.323 --> 03:27.814
No matter who rules Freedonia, to me
you will always be the First Lady.

03:28.037 --> 03:31.986
Permit me... Vera Marcal,
Ambassador Trentino.

03:32.208 --> 03:36.620
I've seen Miss Marcal dance
many times at the theater. - Thanks.

03:38.089 --> 03:42.832
The Honorable Pandooh of Mufhtan!
- I must greet His Honor.

03:49.017 --> 03:51.708
What have you found out?
- Nothing.

03:51.936 --> 03:54.544
I've given up on the revolution.
I have a better plan.

03:55.148 --> 03:59.677
I can control Freedonia easier
by marrying Mrs. Teasdale.

03:59.902 --> 04:03.388
Maybe that's not so easy.
From what I hear,

04:03.614 --> 04:06.981
Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet
on this Rufus T. Firefly.

04:07.201 --> 04:10.438
That's where you come in.
I place him in your hands.

04:10.663 --> 04:13.948
I don't have to tell you
what to do... Careful!

04:15.877 --> 04:19.161
I want you to meet
His Excellency's secretary Bob Roland.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.488
Ambassador Trentino...

04:21.716 --> 04:23.909
Miss Marcal.
- We've met.

04:24.135 --> 04:27.004
I hope
His Excellency gets here soon.

04:27.221 --> 04:29.829
He makes it a point to be on time.

04:30.058 --> 04:32.546
He's never been late
for an appointment.

04:32.769 --> 04:36.420
His Excellency is due
to take his station,

04:36.647 --> 04:39.967
beginning his new administration.

04:40.193 --> 04:46.513
He'll make his appearance when
the clock on the wall strikes ten.

04:46.741 --> 04:50.226
When the clock on the wall
strikes ten,

04:50.453 --> 04:54.437
all you loyal ladies
and you patriotic men,

04:54.666 --> 05:01.580
let's sing the national anthem when
the clock on the wall strikes ten.

05:09.514 --> 05:13.130
His Excellency is due
to take his station,

05:13.351 --> 05:16.468
beginning his new administration.

05:16.688 --> 05:22.309
He'll make his appearance when
the clock on the wall strikes ten.

05:30.076 --> 05:34.024
We'll give him a rousing cheer
to show him we're glad he's here.

05:34.344 --> 05:39.297
Hail, hail Freedonia...

05:44.298 --> 05:48.698
Hail, hail Freedonia.

05:49.303 --> 05:54.903
Land of the brave and free.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.517
You expecting somebody?
- Yes.

06:53.968 --> 06:56.540
Your Excellency...

06:56.763 --> 07:00.462
We've been expecting you.
As chairwoman of the committee

07:00.683 --> 07:03.754
I extend the good wishes
of the people of Freedonia.

07:03.978 --> 07:07.381
Never mind. Take a card.
- What do I do with a card?

07:07.607 --> 07:10.262
Keep it. I've got 51 left.
Now what were you saying?

07:10.485 --> 07:14.599
As chairwoman,
I welcome you with open arms.

07:14.822 --> 07:17.062
How late do you stay open?

07:17.283 --> 07:22.478
I've sponsored you, because you're
Freedonia's most able statesman.

07:22.705 --> 07:25.823
That covers a lot of ground.
You cover a lot of ground, too.

07:26.042 --> 07:29.492
You better beat it or they'll tear
you down and put up offices.

07:29.712 --> 07:34.325
You can leave in a taxi.
If not, you can leave in a huff.

07:34.550 --> 07:38.618
You don't stop talking. You must be
vaccinated with a phonograph needle.

07:38.846 --> 07:41.917
The future of Freedonia
rests on you.

07:42.141 --> 07:46.173
Promise me you'll follow
in the footsteps of my husband.

07:46.395 --> 07:50.344
I haven't been on the job 5 minutes,
and she's making advances to me.

07:50.691 --> 07:53.928
But where is your husband?
- Why, he's dead.

07:54.153 --> 07:58.398
I bet he's using that as an excuse.
- I was with him till the very end.

07:58.616 --> 08:03.561
No wonder he died. - I held him
in my arms and kissed him.

08:03.788 --> 08:06.905
It was murder! - Will you marry me?
Did he leave you money?

08:07.125 --> 08:10.279
Answer the second question first.
- He left me his fortune.

08:10.503 --> 08:13.787
Is that so?
I'm trying to tell you I love you.

08:14.006 --> 08:18.335
Oh, Your Excellency...
- You're not so bad yourself.

08:18.845 --> 08:23.173
I want to present you Ambassador
Trentino of Sylvania.

08:23.391 --> 08:25.583
His presence is a great pleasure.

08:25.810 --> 08:29.758
I can't stay very long.
- Even a greater pleasure.

08:29.981 --> 08:34.344
How about lending us $20 million,
skinflint? - That's a lot of money.

08:34.568 --> 08:39.347
I'll take that up with the Finance
Minister. - Then could I have $12?

08:39.573 --> 08:43.474
$12? - On my 90-day note.
If it isn't paid back,

08:43.703 --> 08:45.527
you can keep the note.

08:45.746 --> 08:48.616
Your Excellency, haven't we
seen each other before?

08:48.833 --> 08:52.236
I'm not sure I'm seeing you now.
It must be something I ate.

08:52.462 --> 08:57.573
Are you trying ... - Don't look now.
There's one man too many here,

08:57.800 --> 08:59.411
and I think it's you.

08:59.635 --> 09:01.378
I'm so sorry.

09:02.805 --> 09:05.923
I want you to meet a charming lady.
- It's about time.

09:06.142 --> 09:08.216
Just a moment...

09:08.644 --> 09:10.255
I want to present Vera Marcal...

09:10.480 --> 09:14.131
Go ahead. I can take it.
- You don't understand.

09:14.358 --> 09:17.762
Vera Marcal, the famous dancer.
- Really?

09:17.987 --> 09:19.847
Can you do this one?

09:22.825 --> 09:25.979
I danced before Napoleon.
No, he danced before me.

09:26.204 --> 09:29.358
200 years before me. Here's one
I picked up in a dancehall.

09:32.585 --> 09:35.276
Here's another one
I picked up in a dancehall.

09:36.130 --> 09:39.995
Perhaps we get a chance
to dance together?

09:40.218 --> 09:42.541
I could dance with you
till the cows come home.

09:42.762 --> 09:45.749
On second thought,
I'd rather you came home.

09:46.307 --> 09:49.461
Where's my secretary?
- Here I am! - Good heavens!

09:49.685 --> 09:53.219
Take a letter.
- Who to? - To my dentist.

09:53.523 --> 09:58.800
"Dear Dentist, Enclosed find check
for $500." Send it off now.

09:59.028 --> 10:02.146
I'll have to enclose a check first.
- You do and I'll fire you.

10:02.465 --> 10:06.283
Your Excellency, the eyes
of the world are upon you.

10:06.510 --> 10:09.877
Notables from every country
are gathered in your honor.

10:10.097 --> 10:15.374
This is a gala day for you.
- A gal a day is enough for me.

10:16.156 --> 10:18.251
I don't think I could handle any more.

10:18.472 --> 10:22.919
For our information,
just for illustration,

10:23.144 --> 10:28.338
tell us how you intend
to run the nation.

10:28.566 --> 10:33.262
These are the laws
of my administration:

10:33.487 --> 10:38.100
No one's allowed to smoke, or tell a
dirty joke, and whistling's forbidden.

10:38.325 --> 10:41.645
We're not allowed to tell
a dirty joke.

10:41.954 --> 10:44.645
Hail, hail Freedonia.

10:44.874 --> 10:49.570
If gum is chewed, the chewer's pursued
and in the hoosegow hidden.

10:49.795 --> 10:52.237
If we should choose to chew,
we'll be pursued.

10:52.715 --> 10:55.453
If any form of pleasure is exhibited,

10:55.676 --> 10:58.035
report to me,
and it will be prohibited.

10:58.429 --> 11:01.416
I'll put my foot down,
so shall it be.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.794
This is the land of the free!

11:05.269 --> 11:08.042
The last man
nearly ruined this place.

11:08.272 --> 11:12.552
If you think this country's bad off,
just wait till I get through with it.

11:16.155 --> 11:18.846
The country's taxes
must be fixed.

11:19.075 --> 11:22.359
If you think you're paying too much,
wait till I get through with it.

11:28.501 --> 11:31.536
I will not stand for anything
that's crooked or unfair.

11:31.754 --> 11:34.741
I'm strictly on the up and up,
so everyone beware.

11:34.965 --> 11:38.001
If anyone's caught taking graft,
and I don't get my share,

11:38.219 --> 11:41.503
we stand him up against the wall
and pop goes the weasel.

11:41.722 --> 11:44.544
So everyone beware,
who's crooked or unfair.

11:44.767 --> 11:48.087
No one must take a bit of graft,
unless he gets his share.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.589
If any man should come between
a husband and his bride,

11:53.818 --> 11:56.639
we find out which one she prefers
by letting her decide.

11:56.862 --> 11:59.933
If she prefers the other man,
the husband steps outside.

12:00.157 --> 12:03.809
We stand him up against the wall
and pop goes the weasel.

12:06.872 --> 12:09.824
The husband steps outside,
relinquishes his bride.

12:10.042 --> 12:13.196
We stand him up against the wall
and take him for a ride.

12:13.421 --> 12:16.016
You have an appointment
at the House of Representatives.

12:16.850 --> 12:20.502
You can't go with your trousers up!
- I can't, eh?

12:20.729 --> 12:24.464
They'll never catch me any other way!
My car!

12:24.691 --> 12:27.217
His Excellency's car!

12:27.444 --> 12:29.186
His Excellency's car!

12:50.050 --> 12:52.871
I'm in a hurry.
Ride like fury.

12:53.095 --> 12:56.212
If you run out of gas, get Ethel...
If Ethel runs out, get Mabel!

13:04.857 --> 13:07.726
Feels good to be back again.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.843
I've failed, Ambassador.
- I know!

13:26.010 --> 13:28.365
I'm sorry.
- You have muddled everything.

13:28.511 --> 13:31.748
If you'd started the revolution
as I planned,

13:31.967 --> 13:35.908
I could have stepped in and placed
Freedonia under the Sylvanian flag.

13:36.075 --> 13:38.123
But Firefly blocked us.

13:38.349 --> 13:42.546
You have no idea how popular he is.
- I've known of that, too.

13:42.770 --> 13:47.181
I have 2 spies shadowing him.
I want to find out something

13:47.399 --> 13:50.470
to discredit him with the people.

13:50.694 --> 13:53.219
Chicolini and Pinky are here.

13:53.447 --> 13:57.016
These are my spies.
Show them in. Wait outside.

14:04.935 --> 14:06.368
We fooled you good!

14:07.040 --> 14:08.561
Gentlemen!

14:16.792 --> 14:20.586
What is this?
- This is spy stuff.

14:26.981 --> 14:29.339
Telegram for you...

14:33.600 --> 14:36.442
He gets mad, because he can't read.
- I see.

14:36.561 --> 14:39.068
We have serious matters to discuss.

14:39.189 --> 14:41.844
Please, be seated.
- Rock-a-bye...

14:42.066 --> 14:46.903
Gentlemen...
- Wait. Here, have a cigar.

14:47.736 --> 14:52.234
A quarter cigar. I smoked the rest.
- No, thanks. I have my own.

14:52.452 --> 14:55.143
Here, try one of these.

14:56.206 --> 14:58.363
It's no good.

15:05.173 --> 15:06.997
That's a good one.

15:13.431 --> 15:17.847
Now let's concentrate.
Have you been trailing Firefly?

15:17.977 --> 15:22.507
Have we been trailing him? My partner
has a nose like a bloodhound.

15:22.732 --> 15:26.016
Really? - The rest of his face
don't look so good either.

15:27.362 --> 15:32.142
We find out all about this Firefly.
Look at this. - Very good.

15:32.283 --> 15:34.642
We must not be disturbed.

15:36.621 --> 15:40.653
This is an important conference.
I do not wish to be interrupted.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.061
Yes, sir.

15:45.832 --> 15:49.354
Gentlemen,
we are not getting anywhere.

15:53.930 --> 15:55.130
Out!

15:58.101 --> 16:03.177
Please, will you tell me
what you found out about Firefly!

16:03.398 --> 16:06.967
You gave us a picture of this man
to follow? - Yes!

16:07.193 --> 16:12.269
We get on the job right away. And
in even less than one hour... - Yes?

16:12.490 --> 16:15.098
We lose him.
Pretty quick work, huh?

16:15.326 --> 16:18.278
I asked you to dig up something.
Did you bring me

16:18.402 --> 16:19.840
his record?

16:20.915 --> 16:22.515
No! No!

16:25.753 --> 16:28.361
And the boy gets a cigar.

16:31.342 --> 16:35.208
Chicolini, I want
a full, detailed report!

16:35.430 --> 16:39.710
Alright: Monday we watch
Firefly's house, but he no come out.

16:39.934 --> 16:43.171
He wasn't home. Tuesday we go
to a ballgame, but he fool us.

16:43.396 --> 16:46.514
Wednesday he go to the ballgame,
be we fool him.

16:46.733 --> 16:50.349
We no show up.
Thursday, nobody show up.

16:50.570 --> 16:54.637
Friday there was no ballgame,
so we listen to it over the radio.

16:54.866 --> 16:59.728
Then you didn't shadow Firefly?
- Sure, we shadow him all day.

16:59.954 --> 17:02.082
When?
- Shadow day.

17:02.182 --> 17:04.570
That's some joke, eh, boss?

17:05.752 --> 17:08.821
What happened on Saturday?

17:09.047 --> 17:12.248
Glad you asked. We follow this man
down to a roadhouse.

17:12.467 --> 17:16.036
He meet a married lady.
- A married lady? - His wife...

17:16.262 --> 17:19.463
Firefly has no wife.
- No? - No!

17:19.682 --> 17:23.298
You know what I think, boss? - What?
- We followed the wrong man.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.253
Gentlemen, I am disappointed.

17:27.751 --> 17:31.762
I entrusted you with a mission,
and you've failed.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.271
But I'm giving you one more chance.

17:35.490 --> 17:41.693
I have credentials here that will
get you into any place in Freedonia.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.523
Ah, here we are.

17:44.749 --> 17:47.736
Are you sure you can trap Firefly?

17:50.964 --> 17:55.576
This time I expect results.
Good luck.

17:56.803 --> 17:59.209
Come on, Pinky.
- Goodbye.

18:25.039 --> 18:26.764
The meeting's called to order.

18:26.972 --> 18:31.786
The Treasury Department's report.
I hope you find it clear.

18:32.005 --> 18:36.072
Clear? A 4-year-old child
could understand it.

18:36.384 --> 18:39.787
Find me a 4-year-old-child.
I can't make head or tail of it.

18:40.472 --> 18:43.542
Members of the Cabinet,
we'll take up all business.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.837
I wish to discuss the tarif.
- That's new business.

18:47.185 --> 18:51.207
No old business? You may take up
new business. - That tarif...

18:51.311 --> 18:53.790
Too late.
That's already old business.

18:54.527 --> 18:58.291
As your Secretary of War...
- Out of order!

18:58.417 --> 19:01.232
Which reminds me, so is the plumbing.
Make a note of that.

19:01.451 --> 19:03.608
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.149
The workers of Freedonia
are demanding shorter hours.

19:10.371 --> 19:14.236
We'll start by cutting
their lunch hour to 20 minutes.

19:14.458 --> 19:18.962
We must look for a new treasurer.
- You appointed one last week.

19:19.062 --> 19:20.622
I'm looking for him.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.938
Enough of this!
How about taking up the tax?

19:25.084 --> 19:28.335
How about taking up the carpet?
- We must take up the tax!

19:28.556 --> 19:31.673
Right. You've gotta take up the tacks
before you take up the carpet.

19:32.059 --> 19:34.964
I give all my energy to my duties,
and what do I get?

19:35.188 --> 19:36.930
Awfully tiresome.

19:37.148 --> 19:41.048
You try my patience.
- You must try mine sometime.

19:41.277 --> 19:45.724
That's the last straw! I resign!
I wash my hands of the whole business!

19:45.948 --> 19:48.520
Good idea.
You can wash your neck, too.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.400
Peanuts!

20:05.282 --> 20:07.190
Hey, come here!

20:07.451 --> 20:12.479
Just the guy I wanna see.
What did you find out about Firefly?

20:12.706 --> 20:15.777
Find out something?
No find out something?

20:16.001 --> 20:18.692
You spy on him?
No spy on him?

20:19.421 --> 20:23.666
What's the matter, you no say nothing?
What's the matter you no speak?

20:24.552 --> 20:28.915
Stop this!
What do you find?

20:29.890 --> 20:34.633
You acting crazy! Come here.
What're you making a face like this?

20:34.854 --> 20:38.220
What's the matter? You wanna fight?

20:38.440 --> 20:40.099
I give you a fight.

20:40.317 --> 20:42.593
Up the stairs, no downstairs!

20:43.571 --> 20:44.933
Come on!

20:45.656 --> 20:47.019
Who do you think you are?

20:58.335 --> 21:02.236
What's the idea, fighting here
and driving away my customers!

21:02.465 --> 21:03.910
You got a mistake.

21:04.133 --> 21:07.085
Ain't no fight.
This guy's working for me.

21:07.303 --> 21:11.037
He tells me nothing.
I ask, why you no speak.

21:11.265 --> 21:15.166
He make a fight like this.
- What's the idea?

21:15.394 --> 21:19.758
That's his idea.
I say something, he say nothing.

21:19.982 --> 21:22.101
Every time I speak...
- Will you shut up!

21:23.444 --> 21:26.598
What're you doing around here?

21:26.822 --> 21:28.730
Who are you?

21:29.408 --> 21:33.191
Can't you say...
Can't you say anything?

21:33.412 --> 21:36.150
He say nothing...
- Shut up! - I am shut up!

21:36.373 --> 21:39.527
You no understand. He and I are spies.
He work for me.

21:39.752 --> 21:42.324
I want him to find out something,
but he no find out.

21:42.546 --> 21:45.949
How am I gonna find out
if he no find out...

21:46.175 --> 21:48.621
Will you quit annoying me!
- Alright.

21:48.761 --> 21:51.913
Just make him stop doing this.

21:53.557 --> 21:58.018
I'm gonna tear you
limb from limb...

22:00.731 --> 22:03.173
I'll do the same...

22:13.911 --> 22:18.572
I no say one thing.
- No, I must...

23:09.508 --> 23:11.748
Now I'm gonna get you!

23:17.641 --> 23:18.884
What're you doing?

23:22.563 --> 23:24.174
Why you...

23:47.588 --> 23:51.572
I'll teach you to kick me!
- I know how!

23:54.178 --> 23:55.978
Stop it!

23:59.391 --> 24:01.833
That's good, eh?

24:04.897 --> 24:06.697
Peanuts!

24:07.650 --> 24:08.850
Hey!

24:12.446 --> 24:15.980
You wanna be a public nuisance?
- How much does the job pay?

24:16.200 --> 24:18.808
I oughtta join the club
and beat you over the head.

24:19.036 --> 24:21.478
Peanuts... to you!

24:21.705 --> 24:26.318
Have you got a license?
- No, but my dog's got a million.

24:26.544 --> 24:30.658
He's some smart dog.
He went with Admiral Byrd to the pole.

24:30.881 --> 24:32.990
I bet the dog got to the pole first.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.585
You win. - Come on up.
I wanna scare the Cabinet.

24:42.017 --> 24:46.714
No, he's not in.
Alright, I tell him.

24:46.939 --> 24:50.389
That was for you. - I'm not in.
I want to talk to you.

24:50.609 --> 24:56.052
Give up that silly peanut stand, and
I'll get you a soft government job.

24:56.532 --> 25:01.441
How about a job in the mint?
- No, I no like a mint.

25:01.662 --> 25:04.649
What other flavor you got?

25:06.876 --> 25:11.156
No, not yet.
Alright, I'll tell him. Goodbye.

25:11.380 --> 25:14.201
That was for you again.
- What ever became of me?

25:15.009 --> 25:20.499
I should have been back hours ago.
I got a swell job for you, but

25:20.723 --> 25:25.252
I have a couple of questions.
What has four pairs of pants,

25:25.478 --> 25:29.675
lives in Philadelphia,
and never rains but pours?

25:30.691 --> 25:32.848
Good one. I give you 3 guesses.

25:33.068 --> 25:37.397
Has 4 pairs of pants, lives in
Philadelphia. Male or female?

25:37.615 --> 25:41.563
Don't think so.
- Is he dead? - Who?

25:41.786 --> 25:45.485
I don't know. I give up.
- I give up, too.

25:45.706 --> 25:49.856
Now I ask you. What's got
a big, black moustache,

25:50.085 --> 25:54.414
smokes a big, black cigar,
and he's a big pain in the neck?

25:54.632 --> 25:57.951
Now don't tell me.
Has a big, black moustache,

25:58.469 --> 26:02.667
smokes a big, black cigar
and is a big pain...

26:03.474 --> 26:06.343
Does he wear glasses?
- You guessed it quick.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.168
Just for that, you don't get the job.
- What job?

26:09.396 --> 26:12.266
Secretary of War.
- I take it. - Sold.

26:31.627 --> 26:35.196
I'd be lost without a telephone!
Don't go away. I wanna talk to you.

26:35.422 --> 26:39.620
Now where were we? Oh yes,
what kind of army should we have?

26:39.844 --> 26:42.914
A standing army.

26:43.764 --> 26:44.964
Why?

26:45.224 --> 26:47.832
Then we save on chairs.

26:50.771 --> 26:52.631
Peanuts...

26:54.400 --> 26:55.600
Scat!

27:04.577 --> 27:06.900
Who are you anyway?

27:09.123 --> 27:13.192
I don't go in much for modern art.
Got any of the old masters?

27:17.673 --> 27:21.491
Not bad.
You have her telephone number?

27:26.474 --> 27:30.208
You could be a big help to me.
Where do you live?

27:33.439 --> 27:36.640
Not much of a place,
but it's home.

27:42.281 --> 27:47.024
I bet you haven't got
a picture of my grandfather.

27:50.831 --> 27:52.631
Not now.

27:53.083 --> 27:54.363
Some other time.

28:05.971 --> 28:09.089
Your Excellency...
- Quiet!

28:09.308 --> 28:12.382
This letter's the work of Trentino.
He's trying to undermine you.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.922
What are you doing about it?
- I'll ring his doorbell and run.

28:16.148 --> 28:19.385
We have to get rid of that man.
I have a plan.

28:19.610 --> 28:23.013
Say something to make him mad,
and he'll strike you.

28:23.239 --> 28:27.187
And we force him to leave the country.
- Swell. Couldn't I strike him?

28:27.409 --> 28:31.275
Ambassador Trentino is sensitive.
Perhaps if you insult him...

28:31.497 --> 28:36.442
I said something to Vera Marcal,
and he slapped me.

28:36.669 --> 28:40.949
Why didn't Vera slap your face?
- She did. - What did you say?

28:43.801 --> 28:47.251
You ought to be ashamed.
Where'd you hear that? - You told me.

28:47.471 --> 28:52.333
Oh, yes. I should have slapped
Mrs. Teasdale when she told me.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.961
Where is Trentino?
- At Mrs. Teasdale's teaparty.

28:55.061 --> 28:57.088
Was I invited? Take a letter.

28:59.483 --> 29:02.850
"You are cordially invited
to attend my teaparty."

29:03.320 --> 29:07.933
Sign Mrs. Teasdale's name, and
tell her I accept. Come on.

29:15.666 --> 29:20.195
I've got an appointment to insult
Ambassador Trentino. Step on it!

29:24.467 --> 29:28.878
My 5th trip today,
and I haven't been anywhere yet.

29:40.900 --> 29:44.350
You don't seem to be making
progress with Mrs. Teasdale.

29:44.570 --> 29:50.061
How? Every time I get her in the mood
to say yes, Firefly pops in.

29:50.284 --> 29:55.360
This is your opportunity. He won't
be here today. - Sure?

29:55.581 --> 30:00.941
Positive. I helped Mrs. Teasdale
with the invitations. - Oh!

30:01.837 --> 30:05.074
His Excellency Rufus T. Firefly!

30:05.299 --> 30:10.627
Hail, hail Freedonia,

30:10.805 --> 30:18.629
land of the brave and free.

30:21.800 --> 30:27.160
I've waited for years. I love you.
Can't you see I'm at your feet?

30:27.389 --> 30:29.914
When you're done with hers,
start on mine.

30:30.142 --> 30:33.378
If that isn't an insult!
- Gloria, I love you.

30:33.603 --> 30:35.179
I realize you are lonely.

30:35.397 --> 30:39.926
Can't we be by ourselves? - What can
he offer you? Wealth? Family?

30:40.152 --> 30:44.100
I can't give you wealth,
but we can have a little family.

30:44.323 --> 30:48.520
Oh, Rufus! - All I can offer you
is a Rufus over your head.

30:48.744 --> 30:54.448
I don't know what to say. - I wouldn't
know what to say either.

30:54.666 --> 30:57.986
Maybe you can suggest something.
You do suggest something.

30:58.211 --> 31:00.653
A baboon.
- What?

31:00.881 --> 31:04.995
I'm sorry. It isn't fair
to the rest of the baboons.

31:05.218 --> 31:08.669
This man's conduct is inexcusable!
- Gentlemen!

31:08.889 --> 31:10.832
I didn't come here to be insulted!

31:11.058 --> 31:13.381
That's what you think!
- You swine! - Come again?

31:13.602 --> 31:17.752
You worm! - Once more?
- You upstart! - That's it!

31:18.523 --> 31:22.389
TouchÃ©. - This regrettable occurrence
may plunge our countries into war.

31:22.611 --> 31:25.931
This is terrible!
- I'm a man of few words.

31:26.156 --> 31:28.230
I'm a man of one word: Scram!

31:28.450 --> 31:31.058
A man doesn't call a Firefly
an upstart!

31:31.286 --> 31:34.736
The Mayflower was full
of Fireflys, and a few horseflies.

31:34.956 --> 31:38.775
The Fireflys were on the upperdeck,
the horseflies were on the Fireflys.

31:40.128 --> 31:44.112
Good day, my Sweet.
- I must speak to you.

31:44.341 --> 31:48.373
See you at the theater. After you get
there, you're on your own.

31:48.595 --> 31:52.875
His Excellency's car!
- His Excellency's car!

31:54.476 --> 31:58.460
No, I'm not taking any more chances.
You can only fool a Firefly twice.

31:58.689 --> 32:01.344
This time you ride in the sidecar.

32:14.705 --> 32:16.944
This is the only way to travel.

32:20.585 --> 32:22.363
Come here, Pinky.

32:23.088 --> 32:24.747
Watch the stand.

32:24.965 --> 32:27.074
Come on, Pastano.

33:55.222 --> 33:59.170
I regret the unfortunate affair
with His Excellency, but

33:59.393 --> 34:04.136
his attitude left me no alternative.
- Maybe we can still avoid this war.

34:04.356 --> 34:06.430
If we only could.
- Yes...

34:06.650 --> 34:10.929
Mrs. Teasdale, I've been recalled
by my president.

34:11.154 --> 34:13.891
Then it's too late?
- Not if he listens to reason.

34:14.116 --> 34:18.183
I'm prepared to pocket my pride
and forget, if he is.

34:18.411 --> 34:22.230
That's wonderful of you,
but His Excellency won't hear of it.

34:22.456 --> 34:24.531
Perhaps he will listen to you.

34:25.085 --> 34:29.235
You think so? - Of course.
- I'll call him.

34:38.681 --> 34:43.543
I hate to disturb you. You're
a busy man, but I must see you.

34:43.770 --> 34:49.094
Where are you? Oh. You can come in
the back way, no one'll see you.

34:50.152 --> 34:53.306
If you think of it,
bring some cheese.

34:54.114 --> 34:59.023
You must come over. I can't tell it
to you over the phone.

34:59.244 --> 35:03.987
It's that kind of story. You ought
to be ashamed. I'll be right over.

35:04.207 --> 35:07.907
You'd better wait outside
until I've talked to him.

35:08.128 --> 35:10.949
Very well,
we'll be out here if you want us.

35:23.435 --> 35:27.585
How'd you get in here?
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

35:27.814 --> 35:31.929
Will you ever forgive me? - After
tonight, will you ever forgive me?

35:32.861 --> 35:37.059
These plans of war are as valuable
as your life. Pretty cheap.

35:37.282 --> 35:40.269
Watch them like kittens.
Have you ever had kittens?

35:40.494 --> 35:43.185
Of course not.
You run around playing bridge.

35:43.413 --> 35:46.650
Can't you see what I'm telling you?
Marry me.

35:46.875 --> 35:49.780
Why, marry you?
- Take me, and I'll take a vacation.

35:50.003 --> 35:52.908
I'll need a vacation
if we get married...

35:53.131 --> 35:56.249
I can see you in the kitchen,
bending over a hot stove.

35:56.468 --> 35:59.195
But I can't see the stove.
Say the word,

35:59.295 --> 36:00.975
and you'll never see me again.

36:02.265 --> 36:03.664
Gloria.

36:08.831 --> 36:11.967
Rufus, what are you thinking of?

36:12.415 --> 36:16.100
All the years I've wasted
collecting stamps.

36:18.323 --> 36:21.750
You will think me
a sentimental old fluff,

36:21.938 --> 36:27.028
but would you mind giving me
a lock of your hair? - A lock?

36:28.458 --> 36:32.608
I had no idea... - I'm letting you off
easy. I was gonna ask for the wig.

36:39.553 --> 36:44.296
You've come to ask for clemency?
- He is on a friendly visit.

36:44.776 --> 36:49.461
He's had a change of heart.
- He's still got the same face!

36:50.402 --> 36:53.846
I'm willing to forget, if you are.
- Forget?

36:54.067 --> 36:57.802
You ask me to forget?
A Firefly never forgets.

36:58.030 --> 37:01.729
My ancestors would rise from their
graves. I'd have to bury them again.

37:01.950 --> 37:05.815
Nothing doing. I'm going to clean
my bed. I'm expecting company.

37:06.038 --> 37:08.776
Please, wait.
- Let go, you bully!

37:10.792 --> 37:13.199
I'm willing to do anything
to prevent this war.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.574
Too late. I've already paid rent
on the battlefield.

37:16.798 --> 37:22.337
Isn't there something I can do?
- I'll talk to you about that later.

37:22.554 --> 37:26.799
Won't you reconsider?
Please, relent... for my sake.

37:27.017 --> 37:31.131
I am a little headstrong.
I come by it honestly.

37:31.355 --> 37:35.137
My father was a Headstrong.
My mother was a little Armstrong.

37:35.359 --> 37:39.307
The Headstrongs married the Armstrongs
and darkies were born.

37:40.781 --> 37:44.480
Silly to lose my temper on account of
the little thing you called me.

37:44.701 --> 37:47.523
Little thing?
What did I call you?

37:48.455 --> 37:51.193
I don't remember what it was.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.198
You mean "worm"?
- No, that wasn't it.

37:56.588 --> 38:01.913
I know... "swine"?
- No, it was a seven-letter word.

38:02.636 --> 38:05.790
Oh yes! "Upstart".
- That's it!

38:06.014 --> 38:08.503
This man is impossible.
An outrage!

38:08.725 --> 38:12.757
My course is clear.
This means war! You runt!

38:12.980 --> 38:14.840
I still like "upstart" the best.

38:15.065 --> 38:18.883
I shan't stay longer.
- Never darken my towels again.

38:19.111 --> 38:21.932
My hat!
- My towel!

38:23.615 --> 38:28.276
Freedonia's war plans are
in Mrs. Teasdale's possession.

38:28.495 --> 38:30.771
I must get hold of them.
- But how?

38:30.998 --> 38:35.575
We have a guest
in Mrs. Teasdale's house, Miss Marcal.

38:36.878 --> 38:40.993
Do you mind waiting outside?
I'll join you. - Certainly.

38:45.804 --> 38:47.546
Excuse me.

38:57.350 --> 38:59.847
Yes, I am alone... No, not yet.

38:59.978 --> 39:03.765
We've got to work fast.
You must get hold of those plans.

39:04.057 --> 39:07.036
Chicolini and his partner
should be there soon.

39:07.194 --> 39:11.412
But I must be careful.
There's another guest here.

39:12.073 --> 39:15.642
Firefly? I don't know.
I think he's asleep.

39:29.049 --> 39:30.500
Ring the bell.

39:34.221 --> 39:35.998
Push the button.

40:26.731 --> 40:31.013
You got the plans?
- No, but they're in the house.

40:31.278 --> 40:35.641
Don't make a sound.
If you're found, you're lost.

40:35.866 --> 40:39.020
You're crazy.
How can I be lost if I'm found?

40:41.245 --> 40:42.641
Got a flashlight?

40:48.044 --> 40:52.076
If they catch you, you'll be
court-martialed and shot.

40:52.299 --> 40:53.499
Vera!

40:57.554 --> 41:03.424
I must go. Remember,
don't make a sound.

41:53.610 --> 41:59.765
Stay here, but keep quiet. If we get
caught, we get court-plastered.

42:08.910 --> 42:11.348
I'm worried. I can't sleep.

42:11.503 --> 42:15.748
What? You're worried?
You can't sleep?

42:15.966 --> 42:18.205
Fine. Now you woke me up.

42:18.426 --> 42:22.209
I won't rest until the plans
are back in your hands.

42:24.099 --> 42:26.126
Please, come over and get them.

42:26.351 --> 42:28.294
The plans? I'll be right over.

42:35.978 --> 42:37.291
Let me out!

42:43.660 --> 42:47.810
Let me out!
Or throw me a magazine!

42:52.065 --> 42:57.659
So that's your game. I'll huff and
puff and blow your door in.

43:05.348 --> 43:07.007
Come in.

43:09.102 --> 43:14.641
I'm so glad you've come.
- I'm glad, too. Got the plans?

43:15.108 --> 43:19.222
You sound so strange.
Why are you talking like that?

43:19.446 --> 43:23.596
Maybe sometime I go to Italy,
and I'm practicing the language.

43:32.334 --> 43:36.199
I'll see my lawyer about this
as soon as he graduates.

43:38.173 --> 43:41.457
Your dialect is perfect.
I could listen to you all night.

43:41.676 --> 43:45.292
But I can't stay all night.
Where's the plans?

43:45.514 --> 43:48.631
In the safe, downstairs.
I'll write out the combination.

44:00.997 --> 44:06.019
There you are. Here's the combination.
Is that clear?

44:07.661 --> 44:09.457
Anything else you want to know?

44:10.622 --> 44:13.916
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your voice?

44:14.937 --> 44:17.396
Let me get you a glass of water.

44:23.051 --> 44:27.083
Here's your water...
What in the world's the matter?

44:31.268 --> 44:35.086
I thought you'd left.
- I no leave.

44:35.313 --> 44:40.056
But I saw you with my own eyes. - Who
you believe? Me or your own eyes?

44:42.237 --> 44:48.974
This excitement's too much. I feel
faint. - I'll get you water.

45:04.259 --> 45:08.788
How about my glass of water?
- I give up. How about it?

45:59.648 --> 46:02.136
What's that?
- Sounds to me like mice.

46:02.359 --> 46:06.936
Mice don't play music.
- How about the old "Micetro"?

46:27.237 --> 46:30.536
Get me headquarters.
Not hindquarters... headquarters.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.960
Rush the guards over,
and have 'em surround the house.

49:38.783 --> 49:41.605
His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly.

49:41.828 --> 49:50.403
Hail, hail Freedonia,
land of the brave and free.

50:02.432 --> 50:07.211
Lieutenant, why weren't the indictment
papers in my portfolio?

50:07.437 --> 50:10.259
I didn't think
they were important.

50:10.482 --> 50:15.095
You didn't think so?
I had my dessert in those papers!

50:15.320 --> 50:17.845
Take this bottle back
and get 2 cents for it.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.285
Hello, boss! - Chicolini,
I bet you 8 to one we find you guilty.

50:23.504 --> 50:27.037
That's no good. I can get
10 to one at the barber shop.

50:27.383 --> 50:31.201
You're charged with high treason.
If found guilty, you'll be shot.

50:31.428 --> 50:35.044
I object.
- On what grounds?

50:35.266 --> 50:36.924
I couldn't think of anything else.

50:37.184 --> 50:40.219
Objection sustained.
- You sustained the objection?

50:40.438 --> 50:43.722
I couldn't think of anything either.
Why don't you object?

50:44.150 --> 50:46.389
When were you born?

50:46.735 --> 50:49.224
I don't know.
I was just a little baby.

50:49.447 --> 50:53.395
Did you try to sell Freedonia's
secret war code and plans?

50:53.617 --> 50:56.355
I sold the code
and 2 pairs of plans.

50:57.913 --> 51:01.696
That's some joke, huh?
- 20 to one we find you guilty.

51:01.917 --> 51:04.276
Have you anyone to defend you?

51:04.503 --> 51:10.077
It's no use. I offered 18 dollars,
but I no find somebody to defend me.

51:10.301 --> 51:14.415
My friends,
this man's case moves me deeply.

51:15.264 --> 51:17.124
Look at Chicolini.

51:17.349 --> 51:22.461
He sits there alone,
an abject figure. - I abject.

51:23.647 --> 51:28.308
Look at Chicolini. He sits there
alone, a pitiable object.

51:28.527 --> 51:30.767
Let's see you get outta that one.

51:30.988 --> 51:32.730
Surrounded by unfriendly faces.

51:32.948 --> 51:36.268
A number from one and ten.
- 11? - Right.

51:36.680 --> 51:40.390
What has a trunk
but no key,

51:40.706 --> 51:42.566
weighs 2,000 pounds...

51:42.792 --> 51:46.242
Irrelevant!
- Elephant! That's the answer!

51:46.462 --> 51:48.619
A lot of elephants in the circus.

51:48.839 --> 51:51.577
That testimony we can eliminate.
- I'll take some.

51:51.801 --> 51:55.868
You'll take what?
- A cold glass of lemonade.

51:56.096 --> 51:58.040
Hey, boss, I'm going good.

51:58.265 --> 52:02.545
He may talk like an idiot
and look like an idiot,

52:02.770 --> 52:05.425
but he really is an idiot.

52:05.648 --> 52:08.932
Send him back
to his father and brothers,

52:09.151 --> 52:12.436
who are waiting for him with open arms
in the penitentiary.

52:12.655 --> 52:15.975
Give him 10 years in Leavenworth
or 11 years in Twelveworth.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.772
I'll take 5 and 10 in Woolworth.

52:18.890 --> 52:21.881
I wanted to get rid of habeas corpus.
I should have gotten rid of you.

52:21.981 --> 52:23.940
I object.
- Even I object. - I object, too.

52:24.166 --> 52:25.481
You can't object!

52:25.709 --> 52:30.121
You're Excellency, General Cooper says
that the Sylvanian troops

52:30.339 --> 52:33.374
are about to land on Freedonia's soil.
This means war.

52:33.592 --> 52:36.912
War would mean
a increase in taxes!

52:37.138 --> 52:42.414
I got an uncle that lives in Texas.
- No, taxes, money, dollars.

52:42.643 --> 52:45.464
That's where my uncle lives!
Dallas, Texas.

52:48.941 --> 52:51.347
More bad news.

52:54.572 --> 52:57.179
Didn't I tell you?
- Your Excellency.

52:57.408 --> 53:00.644
What's on your mind, babe?
- On behalf of Freedonia's women,

53:00.870 --> 53:05.447
I make one final effort
to prevent war. - No kidding?

53:05.666 --> 53:10.362
Trentino says that Sylvania
doesn't want war either. - Either.

53:10.588 --> 53:13.279
Doesn't want war either.
- Either.

53:13.507 --> 53:14.905
Skip it.

53:15.134 --> 53:18.952
I've asked the ambassador to come,
because we both felt

53:19.180 --> 53:24.042
that a friendly conference
would settle everything peacefully.

53:24.268 --> 53:27.552
He'll be here any moment.
- You did a noble deed.

53:27.772 --> 53:31.506
I'd be unworthy of the high trust
if I didn't do everything

53:31.734 --> 53:34.341
to keep our beloved Freedonia
at peace with the world.

53:34.570 --> 53:38.934
I'd be happy to meet him
and offer him the right hand

53:39.158 --> 53:42.774
of good fellowship. I feel sure
he will accept this gesture

53:42.995 --> 53:45.188
in the spirit with which it's offered.

53:45.414 --> 53:49.528
But suppose he doesn't? A fine thing!
I hold out my hand,

53:49.752 --> 53:53.072
and he refuses to accept it.
That'll add a lot to my prestige.

53:53.297 --> 53:56.118
Me, the head of a country,
snubbed by an ambassador!

53:56.342 --> 54:00.919
Who does he think he is? To make a sap
out of me in front of my people.

54:01.138 --> 54:05.502
I hold out my hand,
and that hyena refuses to accept it.

54:05.726 --> 54:11.881
Why, the cheap swine! He'll
never get away with it! - Please!

54:12.233 --> 54:15.350
So, you refuse
to shake hands with me, eh?

54:15.569 --> 54:19.684
This is the last straw!
No turning back! This means war!

54:23.369 --> 54:24.731
Then it's war!

54:24.954 --> 54:30.148
Then it's war! Gather the forces!
Harness the horses! It's war!

54:32.837 --> 54:36.869
Freedonia's going to war...

54:37.091 --> 54:40.458
At last our country's going to war.

54:40.678 --> 54:42.669
We're going to war!

54:42.888 --> 54:45.840
We think
our country's going to war.

54:46.058 --> 54:48.832
We're going to war!
- A fact we can't ignore.

54:49.061 --> 54:53.211
We're going to war.
A fact we can't ignore.

54:53.441 --> 54:57.804
I think they think
we're going to war.

54:59.321 --> 55:02.392
I think they think
we're going to war.

55:38.152 --> 55:41.139
To war! To war!

56:17.149 --> 56:23.719
They got guns, we got guns,
all God's chillun got guns...

56:23.948 --> 56:31.111
We're gonna walk over the battlefield,
'cause all God's chillun got guns.

56:31.330 --> 56:35.065
Hail Freedonia,
don't you cry for me.

56:35.292 --> 56:39.360
I'll be comin' round the mountain
with a banjo on my knee.

57:08.325 --> 57:11.645
To war, to war,
we know we gotta go.

57:11.871 --> 57:14.988
To war! To war!

57:24.842 --> 57:28.493
To war! To war!
We soon will say goodbye.

57:28.721 --> 57:32.171
Oh how we'd cry for Firefly
if Firefly should die.

57:51.243 --> 57:54.230
There'll be 2 lamps
if the enemy is coming by land.

57:54.455 --> 57:56.778
One if they're coming by sea.

58:00.586 --> 58:03.953
They've doublecrossed me!
They're coming by land and sea.

58:04.256 --> 58:07.208
Ride through every village and town,
wake every citizen.

58:07.426 --> 58:11.624
Tell them
the enemy comes from afar...

58:11.847 --> 58:14.004
Be off, my lad!

59:06.527 --> 59:08.885
My husband! Hide in here!

59:16.407 --> 59:20.553
Freedonia's going to war.
- I'm going to take a bath.

01:00:33.653 --> 01:00:37.199
Clear all wires. The enemy
has captured Hill 27 and 28,

01:00:37.421 --> 01:00:39.364
throwing 13 hillbillies out of work.

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:42.327
2 snipers cut into our machine-gun
nest and laid an egg.

01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:45.787
Send reinforcements.
Send the call collect.

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:50.883
Our men are being badly beaten.
I suggest we dig trenches.

01:00:51.101 --> 01:00:54.551
There isn't time
to dig trenches.

01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:57.011
We'll buy 'em ready-made. Here.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:57.232 --> 01:01:00.682
Get 'em this high, and our soldiers
won't need pants. - Yes, sir.

01:01:00.902 --> 01:01:04.139
No, this high, and we won't need
soldiers. - Yes, sir.

01:01:04.364 --> 01:01:07.055
Chicolini, I'm counting on you.

01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:11.268
There's a nest near Hill 28. I want it
cleaned out. - I'll tell the janitor.

01:01:12.331 --> 01:01:16.824
Message from the front.
- Don't we ever get one from the side?

01:01:19.212 --> 01:01:22.082
What is it?
- A gas attack.

01:01:22.299 --> 01:01:25.998
Take a spoon of bicarbonate soda
and water. - Yes, sir.

01:01:29.848 --> 01:01:33.713
Any answer to that message? - No.
- Don't send it.

01:01:43.654 --> 01:01:47.934
This is the last straw!
Where's my Stradivarius? - Here.

01:01:48.367 --> 01:01:51.770
I'll show them they can't fiddle
with old Firefly.

01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:59.570
Look at 'em run! Now we're at war!
- Your Excellency!

01:02:00.045 --> 01:02:02.202
They're fleeing like rats!
- But sir...

01:02:02.422 --> 01:02:04.829
I'll give myself the Firefly medal.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:08.037
You're shooting your own men.
- What?

01:02:08.261 --> 01:02:10.454
You're shooting your own men.

01:02:10.681 --> 01:02:15.127
Here's 5 dollars. Keep it under your
hat. No, I'll keep it under mine.

01:02:15.352 --> 01:02:20.095
We gotta have more men! - Don't be
alarmed. We're looking for volunteers.

01:02:20.315 --> 01:02:25.177
Join the army,
see the navy.

01:02:26.947 --> 01:02:30.563
The army's morale is crumbling.
The men are breaking ranks.

01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:33.771
Where is the Secretary of War?
- Where is the Secretary of War?

01:02:33.996 --> 01:02:38.145
The soldiers are waiting for his
orders. - The Secretary of War!

01:02:43.714 --> 01:02:47.890
Decent of you to dop in.
Our army is facing defeat.

01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:50.867
What do you intend to do?
- I've done it. - What?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.818
Changed to the other side.
- What're you doing here?

01:02:55.046 --> 01:02:57.072
The food's better over here.

01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:06.003
Chicolini, I need you.
What'll it take to come back over?

01:03:06.224 --> 01:03:08.582
I'll take a vacation.
- You're hired.

01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:13.303
Go out on that battlefield and
lead those men to victory.

01:03:14.815 --> 01:03:19.677
Not unless I was in one those big
iron things. What you call 'em?

01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:22.143
Tanks.
- You're welcome.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:27.065
You must come here at once.
We're in danger.

01:03:27.286 --> 01:03:29.395
There's no danger here.

01:03:51.185 --> 01:03:54.836
Wait, I wanna find out something.

01:03:57.984 --> 01:04:00.509
Just as I thought. Coast is clear.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:07.059
You're fighting for this woman's
honor. More than she ever did.

01:04:07.285 --> 01:04:09.311
Your Excellency...

01:04:09.537 --> 01:04:12.442
There goes my gun.
Run out and get it.

01:04:12.665 --> 01:04:17.723
Our ammunition supplies are low.
- Man the boats! I'll get help!

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:29.391
Calling all nations...
This is Rufus T...

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:33.020
Rufus T. Firefly,
through courtesy of the enemy...

01:04:33.285 --> 01:04:34.730
We're in a mess!

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:38.819
Rush to Freedonia. 3 men and 1 woman
trapped in a building.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:42.028
If you can't send help,
send 2 more women.

01:04:42.603 --> 01:04:43.947
Make it 3 more women.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:48.741
We can't hold out much longer.
We must have help.

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:58.628
One of us has to get word
to General Cooper...

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.459
Quiet back there!

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:04.636
Who is going to sacrifice his life?
- We draw lots.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.051
Wait. I got it.

01:05:14.131 --> 01:05:18.060
I did it wrong. Wait.
I start here.

01:05:23.133 --> 01:05:24.696
That's no good too.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.576
I got it right.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.698
A brave man!
Break through the lines.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:33.914
While you're risking life and limb,

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:36.247
we'll be thinking, "What a sucker!"

01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:38.715
Goodbye...

01:05:39.532 --> 01:05:42.719
Hail Freedonia!
- Hail Freedonia!

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.100
Where did they get you?

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:55.263
Careful! It's the only water we got.
- It's the only woman we got.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:05.135
We're surrounded. They're attacking
from the rear. - This way.

01:06:05.235 --> 01:06:07.071
We'll barricade the door!

01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:20.842
This is Firefly. Send us help
at once. - Help is on the way.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.253
Help is on the way!

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:51.530
They got me... Water!

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.875
Water!

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.479
Get me outta here!

01:07:08.082 --> 01:07:10.855
Last time this happened,
I was crawling under a bed.

01:07:11.085 --> 01:07:12.744
If help would only come!

01:07:26.785 --> 01:07:28.420
Any mail for me?

01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:33.662
Keep away from me!

01:07:46.394 --> 01:07:48.707
Trentino! ...That's game.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.994
Call me an "upstart"!

01:07:56.213 --> 01:07:58.453
I surrender!

01:07:58.626 --> 01:08:00.918
You'll have to wait
until the food runs out.

01:08:01.209 --> 01:08:02.787
Victory is ours!

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:07.023
Hail, hail Freedonia...

01:08:07.232 --> 01:08:10.349
Land of the...
