HUH?
I MEAN, THEY ARE WONDERFUL.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.192
- OOH.
- I'LL JUST PASS THESE AROUND.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.562
OH, I MEAN, IF IT'S PICKLED,
IT'S FOR ME,

07:41.595 --> 07:42.563
IS WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.831
I GOT TO GET THESE OUT OF HERE.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.032
IT'S LIKE, AH.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.133
MMM.
OH, YEAH.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.535
IT'S GOOD.
PASS 'EM ALONG.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.870
I ALSO HAVE SOME SARDINES.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.572
I MEAN, IT SAYS
THAT THEY'RE EXPIRED,

07:51.605 --> 07:53.240
BUT I THINK
THAT'S A SELL-BY DATE.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.307
- ENOUGH.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.177
SAY ONE MORE WORD,
AND I'LL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.915
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK
MOST OF YOU JURORS

08:01.949 --> 08:04.618
FOR YOUR TIME AND SERIOUS
TREATMENT OF THIS MATTER.

08:04.652 --> 08:08.656
AND DESPITE SOME OF YOUR OBVIOUS
ATTEMPTS TO BE DISMISSED,

08:08.689 --> 08:10.891
THE FOLLOWING JURORS
HAVE BEEN SELECTED.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.595
NUMBER 4, 6, 23, 14, 8...

08:14.628 --> 08:16.564
- 8!
THAT'S CHET. YES.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.298
- 7, 12, 21,

08:18.331 --> 08:22.570
5, 1, 16, AND...

08:22.603 --> 08:23.571
19.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.608
- FU...N.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.010
TRIALS--TRIALS ARE FUN.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.947
- HEY, JUDGE.
THAT IS A HAT.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.550
THAT'S A BIG-ASS HAT, MAN.
- IT'S NEW. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:36.584 --> 08:38.719
- I THINK I WISH JUDGE WRIGHT
WAS HERE TO SEE--

08:38.752 --> 08:40.654
I SHOULD SEND HER A PICTURE.
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.855
- I DON'T WANT HER TO MISS THIS.
THIS IS GOOD.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.990
- NO. NO.
- ONE...

08:43.023 --> 08:44.191
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO TAKE
A PICTURE.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.959
- TWO, THREE.
[camera shutter clicks]

08:45.993 --> 08:47.060
- THAT--YOU GOT--

08:47.094 --> 08:49.162
I SEE YOU GOT, LIKE,
A LITTLE TYRA BANKS THING HERE.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.297
LOOK AT YOU IN THIS HAT.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.331
I'M GONNA TAG YOU.
THIS IS CUTE.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.332
- TEDWARD.
- GARY.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.333
OH.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.068
WHAT--
- SORRY.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.237
- LITTLE TIP--WHENEVER
YOU'RE GIVING A HIGH FIVE,

08:57.270 --> 08:58.672
LOOK AT THE ELBOW.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.673
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.074
TRY IT. READY?
- OKAY, YEAH.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.310
- OH, DUDE.
SORRY.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.345
- THIS--THIS AIN'T GOOD.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.747
- DID YOU SAY YOUR ELBOW?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.181
- [clears throat]

09:08.215 --> 09:12.620
- DUDE, THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
HAS BECOME REALITY.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.954
- DID THEY CANCEL
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.623
BECAUSE I CANNOT--
- NO.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.057
I GOT PICKED FOR JURY DUTY.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.959
I MEAN, I'M STILL
IN GOOD SHAPE, THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.160
I THINK I'M GONNA
GET ELECTED FOREMAN,

09:20.193 --> 09:22.630
AND I'M JUST GONNA HUSTLE
EVERYONE TO THE RIGHT VERDICT.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.197
- WELL, I STARTED TRAINING GARY
JUST IN CASE.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.098
- HOW'S HE DOING?

09:25.132 --> 09:26.734
- YOU KNOW,
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.602
WHEN YOU TWO ARE "PLANKING"...

09:28.636 --> 09:30.570
- MM-HMM.
- DO YOU EVER HIGH-FIVE?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.041
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUYS.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.109
JUST HAD SOME
WORK-RELATED STUFF, YOU KNOW.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.779
YOU PROBABLY KNOW BY NOW
THAT I AM A JUDGE.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.082
ANYWAY, LISTEN, TOMORROW
I WILL BE THE JURY FOREMAN,

09:42.115 --> 09:43.917
SO I CAN QUICKLY WALK YOU

09:43.951 --> 09:45.786
THROUGH ALL
THE LEGAL MUMBO JUMBO.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.387
- GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT,
DO YOU, RED?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.388
- YEAH, I DO, ACTUALLY.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.624
WE'RE GONNA MOVE THINGS ALONG
PRETTY QUICKLY,

09:50.658 --> 09:53.060
BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE,
I'VE GOT PLACES TO BE.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.062
OKAY?
- NO-KAY.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.363
WHEN YOU WERE OUT
IN THAT HALLWAY

09:56.396 --> 09:57.798
DOING WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE DOING,

09:57.831 --> 09:59.800
THESE GOOD PEOPLE

09:59.833 --> 10:02.002
ELECTED ME JURY FOREMAN.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.336
- YOU GUYS!

10:03.370 --> 10:05.706
- AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE
THIS CASE SERIOUSLY,

10:05.739 --> 10:08.709
AND JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.977
BOOYAH.
[chuckles]

10:10.010 --> 10:11.779
THIS FEELS GOOD,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.413
[laughs]
MM.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.082
NO, NO.
NOT YOU.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.116
ME.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.822
- HEY, TEDWARD.
- HEY.

10:21.855 --> 10:22.923
HOW'S IT GOING TODAY, JUDGE?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.892
OH, WE ALL GOOD
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.293
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.895
KIND OF HIT A BUMP
IN THE ROAD, TEDWARD,

10:27.928 --> 10:29.029
A BUMP IN THE ROAD.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.164
- HEY, I HEARD
YOU GOT JURY DUTY.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.200
I SMELL A FORFEIT
IN THE WORKS.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.435
- THE ONLY THING I SMELL
IS YOUR AXE BODY SPRAY.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.671
TOM, SERIOUSLY,
ONE PUMP ONCE A DAY.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.638
THAT'S IT.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.008
EVEN IF YOU DO MAKE IT
BACK HERE, REBECCA,

10:41.041 --> 10:42.810
YOU'RE NOT TAKING HOME
THE BELT THIS YEAR.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.844
CHECK THIS.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.717
KABOOM.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.452
SHE'S LIKE
A BAR OLYMPICS SAVANT.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.721
IT IS ON.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.424
- IT'S SO ON,
IT'S ALMOST OFF.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.262
- YOU'RE MISSING
HALF OF YOUR SKIRT.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.431
- YEAH, WELL, YOU MISSED
10 MILLION YEARS OF EVOLUTION.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.833
- [chuckles]
THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY,

11:05.866 --> 11:07.167
BUT YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE A HOOKER.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.470
- THOSE PANTS GIVE YOU
FRONT BUTT.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.072
- [chuckles]

11:12.105 --> 11:15.776
- BOBBY, GROWING UP, DID YOU
EVER HAVE ANY GIRLFRIENDS?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.010
- [laughing]
WHAT?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.045
NO.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.980
I-I COULDN'T TALK TO GIRLS.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.749
I COULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THEM,

11:21.782 --> 11:24.051
'CAUSE I WAS A LOSER
WITH A CAPITAL "L."

11:24.084 --> 11:25.485
- AND HAS YOUR LIFE CHANGED

11:25.518 --> 11:27.921
SINCE THE NIGHT
YOU HIRED A FEMALE FRIEND?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.757
- OH, TOTALLY.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.225
I MEAN, I AM--
I AM CONFIDENT NOW.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.761
AND, UH...

11:33.794 --> 11:34.762
[whispering]
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.864
- IS IT TRUE
THAT FEMALE FRIEND

11:36.897 --> 11:38.832
EVEN CAME HERE TODAY
TO SUPPORT YOU?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.167
- [normal voice]
YEP. YEAH, YEAH.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.702
THAT'S HER RIGHT OVER THERE.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.439
- [laughs]

11:46.473 --> 11:47.975
HOW ABOUT THAT?

11:48.008 --> 11:50.410
YOU GUYS HAVE THE SAME PIMP
OR WHAT?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.112
- GOD, I WISH
I COULD CHOKE YOU.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.447
- OOH.
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT COST ME?

12:02.189 --> 12:02.322
.

12:02.355 --> 12:02.790
[handcuffs clatter]

12:03.824 --> 12:05.058
- HEY, TEDWARD.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.227
YOU DROPPED THESE, BUD.
- OH, SO I DID.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.330
STOP.
TOSS 'EM TO ME.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.166
- UH, OKAY.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.167
SORRY.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.937
- YOU NEED TO FOCUS.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.939
[handcuffs slide across floor]
- WHOA. TAKE IT EASY.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.173
I CAN JUST HAND THEM TO YOU.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.409
- NO, YOU CANNOT JUST
HAND THEM TO ME.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.078
GENTLE UNDERHAND LOB--

12:25.112 --> 12:26.246
GO.

12:26.279 --> 12:30.083
- OKAY.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.252
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, OKAY?

12:32.285 --> 12:34.121
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.089
- WE'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.324
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,
DR. BOYD?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.292
[laughs]

12:39.326 --> 12:40.327
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.329
I'VE TALLIED OUR INITIAL VOTE.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.497
- OKAY, JUST SAY IT ALREADY
SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.300
- 11 TO CONVICT,

12:47.334 --> 12:49.336
1 TO ACQUIT.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.005
- 11 TO CONVICT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:52.039 --> 12:53.841
- SERIOUS AS MY MOTHER'S
COKE ADDICTION.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.876
- WHAT?
- OH, YEAH.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.045
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.580
SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY THE HOLDOUT.
- YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S A KID.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.816
HE DIDN'T HURT ANYONE,
HE DIDN'T THREATEN ANYONE,

13:02.850 --> 13:05.152
AND HE DIDN'T LEGALLY VIOLATE
ANYONE'S RIGHTS.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.955
- LEGALLY,
HE BROKE THE LAW, PERIOD.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.858
HE'S GUILTY.
WE VOTE AGAIN.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.026
THIS TIME,
I WANT YOU TO WRITE "GUILTY"

13:13.060 --> 13:14.361
ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER

13:14.394 --> 13:18.431
SO WE CAN HEAD OUT OF HERE,
JUSTICE SERVED.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.267
YOU DO WANT TO GET
OUT OF HERE, DON'T YOU?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.135
- YES...

13:22.169 --> 13:24.271
VERY BADLY.
- YEAH.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.207
WELL, THEN, "JUDGE"...

13:27.240 --> 13:29.977
[laughter]

13:30.010 --> 13:33.313
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.282
- THAT'S MINE.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.257
- STILL 11 TO 1.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.393
[all groan]
- YEP.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.863
AND WE'RE ALL STAYING HERE
UNTIL EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US

13:49.897 --> 13:53.233
GET THIS
SEXUALLY REPRESSED KID OFF.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.167
I-I HEARD THAT.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.869
IT'S NOT--THAT'S--
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.404
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:57.437 --> 14:01.909
- OH, I'M AS SERIOUS
AS YOUR MOM'S COKE ADDICTION.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.111
WHAT?

14:04.144 --> 14:05.145
OH, MY GOSH.
- DON'T DO--

14:05.178 --> 14:07.414
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M HIGH-FIVING MYSELF

14:07.447 --> 14:09.582
OR SLAPPING A TODDLER'S ASS.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.452
- HEY, HEY, HEY--
- NO.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.988
NO, NO, NO, NO.
- NO.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.025
- TELL ME THAT THIS PIZZA
IS SO THAT WE--

14:18.058 --> 14:19.326
YOU AND I--
CAN CARBO-LOAD

14:19.359 --> 14:20.928
BEFORE SERPICO OLYMPICS TONIGHT.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.629
- WE'RE STILL DELIBERATING.
I'M JUST ON A BREAK.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.065
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT, MAN.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.433
- YOU ARE NOT SAYING THIS TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.335
- BELIEVE ME,
THERE'S NOTHING I'D RATHER DO

14:28.368 --> 14:31.038
THAN PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD
WITH URINAL CAKES, OKAY?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.505
BUT I CAN'T LET THIS KID
GO TO PRISON.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.274
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO USE GARY.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.144
- [sighs]
- TEDWARD...

14:37.177 --> 14:39.012
THE LOTUS IS READY.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.514
- THAT IS NOT
A KARATE KID REFERENCE.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
- OH. HEY.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.418
GO GET THAT BELT.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.954
[both grunt]

14:49.656 --> 14:53.126
- YOU ARE 134 SECONDS LATE,

14:53.160 --> 14:56.096
AND THERE'S NO FOOD ALLOWED
IN HERE.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.365
- OKAY, THERE'S A NO-FOOD RULE

14:58.398 --> 15:00.667
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE
MAKING A MESS.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.104
BUT IF WE CLEAN UP,
NO HARM, NO FOUL.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.206
EVERYBODY GETS FED.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.375
AND I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.477
- THE PROBLEM IS,
THERE ARE RULES.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.980
- WELL, SOMETIMES RULES
CAN BE BROKEN

15:13.013 --> 15:15.682
IF NOBODY GETS HURT, HMM?

15:15.715 --> 15:17.350
[box squeaking]

15:17.384 --> 15:20.220
HMM?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.222
LOOKS LIKE SOME PEOPLE
ARE INTERPRETING THE RULES

15:22.255 --> 15:25.658
LIKE I DO, CHET.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.729
- OH, NO,
THERE HE IS.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.431
HELLO, TEDWARD.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.732
NO REBECCA, I SEE.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.968
I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU FORFEIT.
- YEAH!

15:35.002 --> 15:37.437
- NOPE, NEW PARTNER--GARY.
- WHAT?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.739
- REBECCA'S SHIRT--
WEAR IT WITH PRIDE.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.141
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
SORRY.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.709
I-I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT INTO COMPETITION.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.345
- OKAY, COME ON, DR. KUMBAYA,
GROW A PAIR, ALL RIGHT?

15:45.378 --> 15:48.248
REBECCA WANTS YOU TO FILL IN.
DO IT FOR HER.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.017
- HE DOESN'T WANT
TO DO IT, TEDDY.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.484
- YEAH, DUDE,
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
