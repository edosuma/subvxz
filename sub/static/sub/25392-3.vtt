00:45.087 --> 00:47.965
I'm Claire. Are you all right?

00:50.342 --> 00:52.970
Cockroach was beating
on CJ and his mother.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.930
So I stopped him.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.188
You call this stopping him?

01:19.246 --> 01:21.790
He has a concussion.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.711
Maybe a few broken ribs.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.423
He needs an MRI.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.805
I need to keep this quiet.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.600
And I need to keep him talking.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.352
He looks talkative, all right.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.438
Arturo's dead.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.858
I need somebody that was there
that night with Mariah and Shades.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.903
- If he can be flipped...
- You can't flip a dead man, Luke.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.657
<i>If he dies,</i>

01:56.700 --> 01:58.619
<i>you'll be going back to Seagate.</i>

02:13.884 --> 02:15.427
Luke Cage for mayor.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.180
He need to holler
at my sister's boyfriend. For real.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.061
Hey.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.520
Hey.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.482
- You all right?
- Just bad memories.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.319
This ain't my first rodeo
with a domestic violence call.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.031
- Are you going to arrest Luke?
- Of course not.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.743
I'm going to see
if I can't smooth this thing out

02:39.826 --> 02:41.495
before it even gets to that.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.478
This doesn't look good.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.274
It is what it is.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.071
Walk me through what happened.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.199
I came to question Cockroach.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.535
He was beating his girlfriend,
so I stepped in.

03:21.618 --> 03:25.539
Ridenhour is chompin' at the bit
to shut down your vigilante act,

03:25.622 --> 03:28.250
and this doesn't help.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.545
So I do the right thing,
and my freedom's at risk?

03:32.295 --> 03:35.298
If y'all were doing your jobs,
I wouldn't have to do it for you.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.051
Don't you dare talk to me about sacrifice.

03:38.135 --> 03:44.933
Now, you might have cost me my best chance
against Shades and Mariah, doing my job.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.811
There's still one left.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.107
The Jamaican. Nigel.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.694
- Well, then he's my problem now.
- No, he's our problem.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.239
Those guns will eventually make it
to Harlem.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.366
Are you gonna tie me up
in this nonsense

04:01.450 --> 04:03.326
or are you gonna let me do what I do?

04:07.914 --> 04:08.915
Walk.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.084
Quickly.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.004
Before I change my mind.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.052
Jesus, Luke...

04:21.678 --> 04:23.680
you never make things easy.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.079
You want coffee? Blue Mountain?

06:11.162 --> 06:13.290
You no see me just get two cups?

06:14.332 --> 06:16.293
They keep me energized, you know.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.712
What's on the agenda, brethren?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.256
Mariah. Until I change your mind.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.550
Never. We going to Harlem?

06:23.633 --> 06:27.053
Nah. Better she come to Brooklyn.
Or her people them.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.930
Mmm.

06:31.850 --> 06:36.605
Rahtid. What's this?
Arturo Rey is dead.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.481
- Eh?
- Mmm.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.359
And me hear say Cockroach
fall upon Luke Cage fist.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.361
Rassclaat.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.071
Luke Cage everywhere.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.657
So him work for the Stokes now?

06:48.241 --> 06:51.202
Nah. Come to understand she hate the man.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.374
- Him vex me.
- Why?

06:56.458 --> 06:57.709
'Cause him exist.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.672
As long as him have the heart,
Harlem won't fully be mine.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.050
Two bulls can't reign in one pen.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.761
Don Dada is not plural, you know.

07:08.261 --> 07:13.141
Don't make him distract you, mi dads.
Keep your eye upon Mariah.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.853
Her people them, have to come to us
to get Nigel's money.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.688
And them nuh know say him dead.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.899
So I'll give it to her.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.692
You're mad. Why?

07:24.402 --> 07:28.073
I want her nice and fat when I kill her.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.701
Yuh likkle birdie still deh?
At Harlem's Paradise?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.828
- Mmm.
- Good.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.831
Soon we know everything.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.626
Mariah must burn.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.165
You have it.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.750
That thing.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
I never did, but you do.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.798
- Maybe my father...
- No. No.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.967
Jackson could never play like that.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.264
Those hands are pure Stokes.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.477
This keyboard belonged
to our cousin Cornell.

08:40.937 --> 08:45.567
Um, sorry. I should have asked
before using it.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.860
Oh, no.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.322
Our grandmother gave it to him.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.827
But now it's yours.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.830
Come, sit.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.250
Let's eat.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.797
What you thinking about?

09:08.715 --> 09:12.427
The last time I ate here,
I was ten.

09:13.428 --> 09:18.141
I remember the smell of greens
and Cornell playing music

09:18.224 --> 09:21.936
and Mama Mabel yelling at us
for leaving the refrigerator door open.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.692
But I also remember
strangers in the living room.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.070
Hushed tones.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.655
Rooms I couldn't enter.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.243
Bloodied towels in the trash can.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.331
This family has always been...

09:45.960 --> 09:46.961
dark.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.091
Show me a family
that doesn't have dark corners.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.885
But now we can move
past all that, can't we?

09:54.511 --> 09:58.014
Well,
that is what I'm trying, Mommy.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.941
Excuse me, sweetie.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.243
You need to stop
showing up like this without calling.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.786
Since when?

10:19.869 --> 10:23.373
Since I am trying to keep my daughter
out of the family business.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.459
I thought I was family.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.173
Luke Cage got to Cockroach.
He's in the hospital.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.883
We're down to one buyer.

10:33.967 --> 10:38.304
Piranha said we need the money, all of it,
in 48 hours. Who's left?

10:38.388 --> 10:39.556
The Yardies.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.516
Go to Brooklyn. Get it done.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.935
Who are you talking to like that?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.103
I'm not the help.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.232
I'm your partner, among other things.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.488
You really gonna talk to me
about your feelings right now?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.249
Here we are.

12:13.358 --> 12:17.904
I remember when I used to get those
domestic calls when I was still on patrol.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.909
Some asshole, like yourself,
starts beatin' on a woman.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.245
She calls the cops,
but by the time we show up,

12:26.329 --> 12:28.957
she's screaming, "Please, don't hurt him."

12:32.752 --> 12:36.923
Then, when I became a homicide detective,

12:37.006 --> 12:39.259
I would get a call to that same address

12:39.342 --> 12:43.680
and that same woman
would be laying on the floor,

12:44.347 --> 12:47.016
outlined in chalk and photographed.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.311
Why did you attack Luke Cage?

12:51.479 --> 12:54.565
And why did you hurt
your woman and your son?

12:55.358 --> 12:56.359
Lawyer.

12:57.819 --> 13:02.782
They found an exotic shotgun outside
your warehouse dice and shake joint.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.368
Did Mariah sell it to you?

13:05.910 --> 13:06.953
Who?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.584
That's a good-looking fella.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.088
I went to go see Joi.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.049
Friends with her ex-man, Gipp.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.261
I don't know why Luke targeted me.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.305
I'm the victim in all of this.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.641
Oh.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.767
Not yet.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.186
But you will be.

13:32.770 --> 13:36.024
As soon as Mariah finds out
you've been talking to the cops.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.193
You only half the cop that Scarfe was.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.195
Oh, my bad.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.533
Mmm. You got the fire in your eyes, girl.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.580
But you like to be handled
when no one else is watching.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.291
- Most bitches do.
- You know what?

13:53.374 --> 13:54.375
Misty!

13:55.126 --> 13:57.378
Outside. Now.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.507
What did I tell you
about interrupting an interrogation?

14:01.591 --> 14:04.427
- He's not yours to interrogate.
- You need to get her out my face, Bailey.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.721
Could both of you all just chill out?

14:07.430 --> 14:12.685
Okay, look, Nandi's right.
You let a perp leave the scene of a crime.

14:12.769 --> 14:16.439
- Oh, so Luke Cage is a perp now?
- This is our case, not yours.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.777
It's funny how you seem to be trailing
behind me on your investigation.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.132
Ooh.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.260
You in the doghouse, man?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.640
- You go Eric BenÃ©t?
- Never that.

14:53.017 --> 14:53.935
Whatever you did,

14:54.018 --> 14:56.229
whether your fault or not,
say you're sorry.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.606
That woman's so fine,
"yes" is always the answer,

14:58.689 --> 14:59.941
unless "no" is required.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.654
- Sometimes, she needs to hear "no."
- I hear you.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.030
I don't agree.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.328
- You didn't come home.
- No.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.416
I didn't know whether you were
going to talk to me or at me.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.210
That's unfair.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.754
Unfair?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.132
You called the po-po on me, woman.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.472
I'm gonna call Nike back.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.349
Good to see you, Claire.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.109
I called an ambulance for him
and Misty for you.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.570
They called the cops.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.700
I lost control of the situation
when you lost control.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.871
You could have just tapped
Cockroach on the head.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.874
It would have conked him out.
I've seen you do it.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.042
I've seen you raw...

16:01.752 --> 16:03.337
but never brutal.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.923
Yeah, well, sometimes
brutality gets shit done.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.675
What can I say?

16:21.772 --> 16:26.736
What the hell were you thinking? You go
to a crime scene without authorization.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.364
You let an assault perpetrator go
without authorization.

16:30.448 --> 16:36.662
Luke Cage is out there doing things that
you and me and Bailey and Nandi can't.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.166
Look, we are this close
to taking down Mariah.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.169
Without clear, present,
actionable evidence,

16:43.252 --> 16:44.754
we can't move on Mariah!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.923
And right now, you have none of that.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.258
Personally, I'd sideline
your insubordinate ass,

16:49.342 --> 16:51.219
but this decision is above my pay grade.

16:51.302 --> 16:55.723
You're the department's Private Ryan.
They can't let anything happen to you.

17:40.893 --> 17:45.022
Maureen, Eileen, Christine.
Give me them points.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.192
Check them.
You know the man can't count for shit.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.654
Only thing mi can't count
is how many times I beat your ass.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.031
Whoo!

17:55.992 --> 17:58.160
Take a seat anywhere you like, love.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.664
- Unfortunately, I'm not here for the food.
- You sure?

18:01.747 --> 18:05.585
We have the best curried goat
in all the city. Guarantee it.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.461
Thank you, but I'm not hungry right now.

18:07.545 --> 18:12.341
Something to drink?
Ginger beer? Rum? Coffee?

18:14.010 --> 18:17.930
No, ma'am.
I'm looking for a man named Nigel.

18:19.557 --> 18:24.145
You have to be more specific.
Plenty of Jamaicans named Nigel.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.857
He's a part of a crew called the Yardies.

18:31.360 --> 18:36.490
I don't know nothing about them.
Haven't heard that name in a long time.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.535
Better you ask them.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.998
Thank you.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.423
Um, excuse me.
I hate to interrupt your game...

18:52.506 --> 18:54.842
Then don't.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.639
I need your help.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.474
- You need a job?
- No.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.768
Good. Go block out the sun somewhere else.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.813
- Maybe him looking for a wife.
- Ooh.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.650
You got a wife?
You know, my daughter, she...

19:10.733 --> 19:12.610
Man, ain't nobody want your daughter.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.866
- I'm looking for Nigel.
- You check in the phone book?

19:20.034 --> 19:21.285
Do you know who I am?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.121
You're Luke Cage.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.500
Him say him faster than Usain Bolt.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.584
I never said that.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.672
- He the man from up in Harlem.
- Yeah, but this ain't Harlem.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.716
- Walk good!
- And walk out of here.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.404
Greetings, brother.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.324
I'm here to speak to Nigel.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.577
Nigel's business is my business now.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.416
I don't know you.
I'm here on behalf of Mariah Dillard.

20:08.499 --> 20:12.420
Stokes. Mariah Stokes.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.549
Nigel had a big head,

20:59.341 --> 21:03.596
a big mouth and small ideas.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.972
Him had no vision.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.271
I been rethinking
the value of this gun deal.

21:13.564 --> 21:16.233
I need you to convince me
of this thing, yeah?

21:17.943 --> 21:19.361
Hmm.

22:53.664 --> 22:58.711
Jeff Alexander, after Barack said that,
how could I resist?

22:58.794 --> 23:03.465
The rest, as we say, is history.

23:08.762 --> 23:12.516
Oh, you made it.
Ah, I always can depend on you.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.187
Ladies, checkbooks, checkbooks.

23:18.105 --> 23:22.192
Hello, Tilda. I'm Alex,
your mother's assistant.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.820
Got anything stronger?

23:24.903 --> 23:26.530
Ha. You are Mariah's daughter.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.169
I hope you are taking
good care of her, Alex.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.462
Absolutely.

23:41.545 --> 23:45.174
Excuse me, Madam Councilwoman.
Nice meeting you, Tilda.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.969
Come in. Hey.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.805
Wow. You always did like it siddity.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.933
Oh, I invented "bad and bougie."

23:55.017 --> 23:57.061
Girl, go get yourself a drink.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.313
There's a mescal over there
with your name on it.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.314
Oh, a real drink.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.408
Hey, thanks for coming. Hi, darling.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.452
Is Mark Higgins here yet?

24:13.535 --> 24:18.165
He's been hanging out with Piranha
all night and looking at Stephanie.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.628
- You mean Billie. Capable girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.423
- Where's Hernan?
- Where he needs to be.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.677
Only thing that matters
is that Mark Higgins stays in the pocket.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.472
I've made sure Stephanie invites him
to Harlem's Paradise for drinks.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.099
You can reel him in there.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.393
Ahab ain't got shit on me.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.145
Again.

24:40.688 --> 24:41.522
Double.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.607
Glad you called.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.904
Danny said he's been trying to reach you,
and you won't pick up.

24:48.987 --> 24:52.074
I told the barefoot billionaire
the same thing I told Luke

24:52.157 --> 24:53.826
and everybody else.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.203
I don't need his charity.

24:56.286 --> 24:59.957
- You at least talking to someone?
- I'm talking to you right now.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.584
- There's nothing wrong with you, Misty.
- Bullshit.

25:02.668 --> 25:06.380
I'm all jammed up. Emotions and anger.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.842
I can't even see things the way I used to.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.136
You lost your arm, not yourself.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.972
Yeah. Well, it was a pretty big part
of my self.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.685
I'm a righty. You know.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.896
I mean, I dribbled right...

25:23.439 --> 25:27.651
and with the ball in my hand,
I could see everything.

25:28.986 --> 25:29.987
Now?

25:31.196 --> 25:32.322
It's cloudy.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.200
Okay.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.035
Uh...

25:38.370 --> 25:40.664
Close your eyes. Stop...
Stop looking at me.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.500
Okay.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.335
Listen, bear with me.

25:47.045 --> 25:52.217
Our physical bodies, they're just...
they're just channels, okay?

25:52.301 --> 25:56.096
For our energy and our power. Chi.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.225
- "Chi"?
- Yes, chi. Close your eyes.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.854
Concentrate. Breathe.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.148
Feel the flow.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.195
Om.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.572
Be aware of your whole self.

26:13.655 --> 26:18.827
The only thing my whole self is aware of
is how hokey all of this

26:18.911 --> 26:20.204
- Zen nonsense...
- "Hokey"?

26:20.788 --> 26:21.747
Hey.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.123
- You came to me.
- Hey!

26:23.207 --> 26:24.958
- I'm not easy.
- Stop!

26:25.042 --> 26:26.335
- You don't like that?
- No!

26:30.839 --> 26:34.510
Do you feel good, huh?
Taking down a cripple?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.512
Yeah. If that's how you see yourself.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.765
You don't know what it's like...

26:41.350 --> 26:43.435
to feel powerless.

26:43.519 --> 26:48.690
To have somebody take
your identity from you, your soul.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.279
I do, actually.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.532
More than you know.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.539
Misty, you are the reason
I still have an arm.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.876
When Bakuto attacked me, what did you do?
You jumped in. You're selfless.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.254
I admire that.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.510
So never pity. Ever.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.237
You thirsty?

27:35.863 --> 27:37.489
I got plenty of water.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.284
That's not what I mean.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.706
Come on.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.549
Hello...

27:56.925 --> 28:00.304
- Claire.
- Claire. I am sorry.

28:01.597 --> 28:02.681
I'm new.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.475
Big congregation.

28:07.185 --> 28:10.939
I'm James, but you can call me Rev
if that makes you more comfortable.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.358
No, James is fine.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.235
James it is.

28:16.194 --> 28:20.991
I'm new here. You can tell, this, uh...
This really isn't my thing.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.369
Well, that's the beautiful thing
about Jesus.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.874
He wasn't all about the church.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.961
Jesus was all about the people
who make up the church.

28:33.045 --> 28:37.007
"For when two or three
gather together in my name...

28:38.467 --> 28:40.135
I am there with them."

28:41.929 --> 28:43.472
There's just two of us.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.391
He's here.

28:55.609 --> 28:56.818
You look troubled.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.196
I'm not.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.824
- My boyfriend is.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.703
He's going down a dark path.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.165
One that I'm not sure that I can follow.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.626
He's angry.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.754
He's lost his purpose.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.798
Well, what's yours?

29:17.881 --> 29:20.842
- Excuse me?
- What's your purpose, Claire?

29:20.926 --> 29:25.264
How can you help him find his
if you can't state yours?

29:27.349 --> 29:28.850
I was a nurse.

29:30.352 --> 29:34.189
And now I help people
with special physical abilities.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.149
Athletes?

29:37.734 --> 29:38.735
Sort of.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.613
Luther, I helped the most.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.866
And now he's in a place
where I can't help him.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.871
Because I don't know how.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.916
Now, this is where scripture comes in.

29:53.458 --> 29:57.838
"Counsel in the heart of man
is like deep waters.

29:58.380 --> 30:02.217
But the man with understanding
will draw it out."

30:03.427 --> 30:04.428
Get it?

30:05.095 --> 30:06.179
It's like saying

30:06.263 --> 30:10.726
you can't save someone from drowning
unless you have on your life jacket.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.147
Or you make enough room on the door
for both of you to float.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.152
<i>Titanic?</i>

30:23.864 --> 30:25.532
That always bothered me.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.286
Rose had plenty of room
for Jack on that door.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.746
Keeps me up at night.

30:35.083 --> 30:39.963
Okay, you know what I'm saying.
Tell me, Claire, do you love Luther?

30:40.047 --> 30:41.590
Yes, I do love Luke.

30:47.637 --> 30:51.016
Then you dive right into the deep waters
of your heart,

30:51.933 --> 30:54.061
and you will find your answer.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.941
God bless.

31:00.817 --> 31:01.818
Amen.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.326
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.161
- What happened, boy?
- Luke Cage is here.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.621
- Talk!
- Point the guns at the door!

31:12.704 --> 31:13.955
- Talk, man!
- It's Luke Cage!

31:54.704 --> 31:55.872
I'm Luke Cage.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.960
Me know who you are.
You must be mad coming up to my turf.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.170
You're not faster than Usain Bolt,
you know.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.964
I never said I was.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.802
- I'm looking for Nigel, man.
- Him gone. Headed elsewhere.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.098
You have something to say, say it to me.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.143
Your gun deal with Mariah Dillard
ain't happening...

32:16.226 --> 32:20.564
Stokes. Mariah Stokes.

32:20.647 --> 32:24.401
You're not taking over.
Leave now, and I won't have to hurt you.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.946
You want to tell me what to do
like I'm a little schoolboy? Hmm?

32:28.029 --> 32:31.032
I'm stopping Mariah Dillard
and anyone else who's in bed with her.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.201
The enemy of me enemy is me friend.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.456
We could work together, you know.
You don't know my story.

32:37.539 --> 32:40.625
I know you're trouble and you're bringing
that trouble to Harlem.

32:40.709 --> 32:44.546
Harlem is not your birthright.
It's mine, brethren.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.007
Harlem is under my protection now.

32:48.008 --> 32:52.679
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
Now stay out of my yard.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.101
You wanna talk about a yard with a Yardie?
Come.

33:07.277 --> 33:08.195
You.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.147
Shit.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.688
My grandmother, Mabel Stokes,

35:07.272 --> 35:10.150
believed in stepping up
for people in need.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.236
She considered it a privilege,

35:13.320 --> 35:19.284
which is why our Shirley Chisholm Complex
will feature new child-friendly services,

35:19.367 --> 35:24.247
such as on-site daycare, rent control
and financial planning,

35:24.331 --> 35:27.959
to inaugurate our
sweeping Family First Initiative.

35:28.043 --> 35:31.212
Helping... Go ahead, clap, clap...

35:37.969 --> 35:40.805
Helping hardworking single mothers in need

35:40.889 --> 35:45.185
raise happy, ambitious children
throughout our complexes.

35:45.268 --> 35:49.814
Government assistance is good.
It works, sure.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.985
But it takes a mother's touch
to make things special.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.786
This is personal for me.

36:04.245 --> 36:08.917
I met a dashing man at Howard
one day on the quad.

36:09.542 --> 36:14.130
He was eight years older and had just
graduated from Howard Medical School.

36:14.839 --> 36:18.093
I fell for him, hard.

36:19.761 --> 36:23.556
Much to the consternation of my family,
because of our age difference.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.643
His name was Jackson Dillard.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.020
We eloped.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.899
And my Jackson went off to Central America

36:32.982 --> 36:37.862
to provide medical services and training
to campesinos in Nicaragua.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.492
The day I found out I was pregnant

36:42.575 --> 36:47.997
was the day that he was shot
and killed by the Contras.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.960
My daughter, Tilda, was born,

36:52.627 --> 36:57.298
and I quickly realized
that I was ill-equipped

36:57.382 --> 37:03.596
to raise this glorious
itty-bitty chocolate drop by myself,

37:03.680 --> 37:06.850
and so I swallowed my pride
and I returned home.

37:08.518 --> 37:10.645
Mama Mabel embraced me.

37:11.312 --> 37:15.150
That was our family motto. "Family first."

37:15.233 --> 37:17.694
Always. No matter what.

37:18.528 --> 37:22.365
No matter... how complex.

37:27.287 --> 37:33.376
In fact, I am absolutely thrilled
to have my daughter here with us today.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.087
Dr. Matilda Maybelline Dillard.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.380
Wave, Tilda.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.851
Family is a blessing.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.146
And no mother should
ever have to do it alone.

37:54.606 --> 38:01.446
With your help and your dollars,
our Family First Initiative will ensure

38:01.529 --> 38:07.160
that in all of our complexes uptown,
where we take care of our own,

38:07.243 --> 38:10.079
no mother will ever have to.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.457
Family first, always.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.377
Harlem first, always. Thank you.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.009
Thank you so much.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.304
The British Library.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.099
Mmm-hmm.

38:30.183 --> 38:32.852
Second largest
only to the Library of Congress.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.896
- Did you know that?
- Mmm-mmm.

38:34.979 --> 38:40.527
I would... I would go and I... I would sit
and I would read everything.

38:40.610 --> 38:45.240
Hardy, Chaucer... that other dead guy.

38:47.909 --> 38:51.746
You would go to a library
if you won a million dollars?

38:51.830 --> 38:54.290
- Yeah. Pretty much.
- You're lame.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.251
- What?
- It's lame.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.669
Okay, what would you do?

38:58.878 --> 39:05.510
Ford Mustang, black, 6-bolt V-8 engine,
with cast-iron water pumps.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.847
- Well, your dick is bigger than mine.
- You're goddamn right, it is.

39:09.931 --> 39:13.518
Ladies, ladies, name's Morty. A-ha...

39:13.601 --> 39:16.604
You mind if I dip-dip my toes
in this conversation?

39:18.523 --> 39:21.192
- Wow.
- Morty...

39:22.527 --> 39:24.195
- quit while you're ahead.
- Mmm-hmm.

39:24.279 --> 39:28.491
The, uh... The water is too shallow
for three people. I'm sorry.

39:29.075 --> 39:32.203
Well, then call me Mr. Fish, baby.
I'll adapt.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.705
Get lost.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.457
That's cool.
I'm not really talking about you, anyway.

39:36.541 --> 39:40.086
I'm all about the sisters.
You know what I mean?

39:46.843 --> 39:49.095
Morty, is it?

39:49.804 --> 39:54.225
You need to swim you
and your whack-ass game back over there.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.687
No, I'm right where I need to be.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.773
You that bitch that sent
my brother to Dannemora.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.698
You know, that's the second time
somebody's called me a bitch today.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.742
- Hmm.
- And it's gonna be the last.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.077
Bill Norris. Don't remember him?

40:13.161 --> 40:16.331
Sorry, I don't look down before I flush.

40:17.248 --> 40:22.253
Ooh, you got a real mouth on you, girl.
I'mma... stick something in it.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.756
Oh...

41:28.736 --> 41:29.821
Whoo!

41:31.447 --> 41:33.241
Somebody got their swagger back.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.660
What you know about swagger?

41:35.743 --> 41:36.869
Borrowed Danny's iPod.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.498
What? You want a hug?

41:44.752 --> 41:46.129
Let's go.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.383
Put it on his tab.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.588
- You got all the bullet holes?
- From what?

43:10.671 --> 43:13.925
The ricochet from Luke Cage.
Did you save any fragments?

43:14.509 --> 43:16.761
- You sound like a fan.
- Well...

43:18.971 --> 43:20.598
That was a beautiful speech.

43:21.182 --> 43:24.143
Thelma Gordon raved about it.
You really outdid yourself.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.270
You had our hearts in your hand.

43:26.354 --> 43:30.274
Mark, helping people
has always brought me joy.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.361
But as we both know...

43:34.320 --> 43:35.947
joy ain't free.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.000
I like the third one.

43:50.169 --> 43:54.090
- You are a freak.
- What do you want? Money?

43:55.258 --> 43:56.092
Cindy...

43:56.175 --> 44:00.847
Oh, we both know what my soror will do
when she sees these pictures.

44:01.806 --> 44:05.935
I don't want your money, Mark.
I need a vote, of confidence.

44:06.018 --> 44:06.978
What do you mean?

44:07.061 --> 44:11.649
Mr. Jones, for your protection,
would you please excuse us one moment?

44:11.732 --> 44:12.817
Absolutely.

44:13.568 --> 44:14.569
Billie.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.076
Please.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.829
Speak your piece.

44:24.912 --> 44:30.626
"Piece" is a good word.
Because that's what I want, my piece.

44:31.544 --> 44:36.257
Your company, Atreus Plastics,
is up for acquisition by Glenn Industries.

44:36.841 --> 44:39.427
I'm about to purchase
$20 million worth of stock.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.889
Tomorrow, you and the rest of the board

44:42.972 --> 44:46.058
will vote in favor of that deal
to go through.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.187
I need you to ensure that merger.

44:49.270 --> 44:52.982
Atreus is the biggest black-owned
plastics company in the world.

44:53.065 --> 44:57.111
You think I'm going to sell my company
at pennies on the dollar

44:57.194 --> 44:59.113
to some goddamn crackers?

44:59.196 --> 45:03.284
Saltine or Ritz. Either way, you will.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.870
Because I want my cheese.

45:08.122 --> 45:12.126
Sell it, vote for the merger and retire.

45:12.209 --> 45:15.546
If you don't,
these pictures will go everywhere.

45:16.505 --> 45:17.840
And I got video.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.301
I'm not talking MediaTakeOut.

45:20.885 --> 45:23.304
I'm talking WorldStar.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.770
Oh, sweetie, I didn't know you were here.

45:31.354 --> 45:34.273
Actually, I'm just stopping by
to say good night.

45:34.357 --> 45:37.693
I missed you at the end.

45:37.777 --> 45:40.112
Tilda, this is Mark Higgins.

45:40.196 --> 45:44.700
He is single-handedly bankrolling
our Family First Initiative.

45:58.881 --> 46:02.301
You put me on the spot out there.

46:02.385 --> 46:05.596
Oh, I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.139
Let me finish. Um...

46:10.017 --> 46:13.104
Emotions are not my area of expertise.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.398
I have a hard time letting people in.

46:16.357 --> 46:18.943
But when I saw you up there today,

46:19.777 --> 46:23.614
through all the lies and hurt,

46:24.365 --> 46:25.449
I felt something.

46:26.033 --> 46:29.036
I didn't want to, but I believed you.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.457
I guess I never thought of our situation
from your point of view,

46:33.541 --> 46:36.502
and for that I apologize.

46:38.921 --> 46:44.719
Sweetie, you have no idea
how much that means to me.

46:46.595 --> 46:48.514
Here. Sit.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.938
- Mommy...
- Wait.

46:56.605 --> 46:59.817
I know it's hard to wrap your head around,

47:00.401 --> 47:04.697
but every powerful family
has some dark memories.

47:05.448 --> 47:08.409
But I've always tried
to bring us into the light.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.787
We've lost a lot of time, Tilda.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.706
Now we get to make up for it.

47:19.962 --> 47:23.924
Okay, I will come by the shop
tomorrow to see you.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.384
Good night, sweetheart.

47:35.352 --> 47:36.771
Tell me something good!

47:41.692 --> 47:44.111
Jamaican me crazy, baby!

47:45.029 --> 47:48.157
The Jamaicans paid
way over our asking price.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.284
There are ten more bags like this
to bring in.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.495
They were very eager to close this deal.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.914
I didn't know Nigel had it like that.

47:54.997 --> 48:00.503
Wasn't Nigel. It was someone else.
Jamaican but aggressive.

48:01.670 --> 48:02.671
Who cares?

48:05.132 --> 48:08.552
Piranha! Get your tight ass in here!

48:09.845 --> 48:12.014
We got the money, nigga.

48:17.937 --> 48:19.939
Baby cousin, wah gwaan?

48:21.273 --> 48:22.483
You have a name?

48:23.734 --> 48:26.862
They're using the money
to buy stock in Atreus Plastics.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.532
Using a Wall Street man
named Piranha Jones...

48:29.615 --> 48:32.701
Piranha? Like the fish?

48:32.785 --> 48:34.703
Yes. Can I quit now?

48:34.787 --> 48:36.122
Soon.

48:36.205 --> 48:39.250
Little more time,
and we'll have everything we want.

48:42.711 --> 48:43.963
Me like fish.

48:44.797 --> 48:47.967
So many different ways of filleting it.

48:48.050 --> 48:50.719
Auntie, can you roast some snapper?

48:52.680 --> 48:54.140
I'm starving.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.826
Now I'll lecture you...

49:16.412 --> 49:18.038
'cause I'm a fool for you.

49:20.332 --> 49:22.084
I love you so much.

49:23.460 --> 49:28.591
I love you, too.
But you can't castrate me.

49:31.719 --> 49:35.806
Preventing you from going back to jail
lessens your manhood?

49:36.682 --> 49:39.059
I'm finally getting results, Claire.

49:40.269 --> 49:41.854
Shit's getting done.

49:43.063 --> 49:46.525
Look, Pop always talked
about Kenyatta, right?

49:46.609 --> 49:48.068
I see his point.

49:49.445 --> 49:53.073
I'm rough, but... I'm still a hero.

49:53.157 --> 49:58.120
Really? If beating your chest around town
is what you need to call yourself a hero,

49:58.204 --> 50:00.956
then I question
your understanding of the word.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.875
This shit is changing you, Luke.

50:02.958 --> 50:06.921
- It's making me more who I am.
- You're scaring people, Luke.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.840
You're scaring me.

50:09.924 --> 50:12.468
I'm a black man in a hoodie.

50:13.552 --> 50:16.472
People have always been afraid of me.

50:18.557 --> 50:23.187
Look, you never had anybody
clutch a purse on an elevator, okay?

50:23.270 --> 50:25.397
Or follow you around the store.

50:25.481 --> 50:28.275
Or cross the street when they
see you coming, now have you?

50:28.359 --> 50:31.111
I didn't need to leave my house
to feel racism.

50:32.321 --> 50:33.822
<i>Soy Afrocubana.</i>

50:34.990 --> 50:39.203
I've got family members so filled
with shame and self-hatred,

50:39.286 --> 50:41.622
they will deny each other to the grave.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.999
That's how deep it can run.

50:45.084 --> 50:48.796
But you rise above it.
You rise above the labels.

50:50.547 --> 50:53.842
Baby, a black man only has two choices
in this world.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.011
You can either lean into the fear

50:56.095 --> 50:58.180
and be the nigga
people already think you are,

50:58.264 --> 51:01.475
or you can play the big,
docile house cat with a smile.

51:01.558 --> 51:05.688
That's like saying the only choice
for a woman is ho or housewife.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.065
It's not that simple.

51:08.148 --> 51:10.359
You don't need to feed your anger
to prove a point.

51:10.442 --> 51:15.614
I'm a man. Okay? Full-fledged.

51:15.698 --> 51:17.324
My anger is real.

51:18.450 --> 51:22.413
But if I can use that anger
for intimidation and fear to do work,

51:22.496 --> 51:23.539
then so be it.

51:23.622 --> 51:26.458
If I have to speak the language
of those who would do others harm

51:26.542 --> 51:29.003
to make them stop, then so be it.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.421
But that's not you!

51:31.005 --> 51:33.882
Yeah, you can use anger as a tool.

51:34.508 --> 51:37.553
But you disable yourself
when you use it as a crutch.

51:37.636 --> 51:42.182
You don't get to pick and choose the parts
of me that you like and dislike, baby.

51:42.266 --> 51:45.227
If you're down with me,
you have to be down with all of me.

51:45.311 --> 51:48.397
I am so down, but...

51:48.480 --> 51:49.523
But what?

51:54.486 --> 51:56.780
Sometimes you have to step on a cockroach.

51:56.864 --> 51:58.115
I get it.

51:59.158 --> 52:01.368
But when you enjoy the stomping?

52:01.910 --> 52:05.164
What's next? You become an exterminator?

52:05.247 --> 52:07.541
You think I seek this shit out?

52:08.917 --> 52:11.920
I never wanted this. Any of it.

52:13.172 --> 52:15.174
Between you and Pop always on me

52:15.257 --> 52:17.259
about stepping out of the shadows, about...

52:17.343 --> 52:20.554
Yo, see. That's your problem right there.
You won't take responsibility.

52:20.637 --> 52:23.974
I am taking responsibility!
By taking over!

52:24.058 --> 52:26.727
By shutting things down, one by one!

52:26.810 --> 52:28.520
No, you're running.

52:29.229 --> 52:32.024
You're blaming me.
You're blaming your father.

52:32.107 --> 52:34.443
- No, no. Don't. Don't. Don't.
- You're blaming Pops.

52:35.027 --> 52:37.446
Don't talk about my father. Okay?

52:45.329 --> 52:47.289
I met with your father today.

52:48.874 --> 52:50.876
And he's not the ogre
that you think he is.

52:50.959 --> 52:52.836
You had no right to do that.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.755
You should talk to him, Luke.

52:56.090 --> 52:58.467
Oh, God forbid he's changed

52:59.009 --> 53:02.054
and you can't use him as an excuse
to fuel your anger anymore.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.181
If he were to see
what you did this morning

53:04.264 --> 53:07.142
and your justifications,
he'd be ashamed of you.

53:07.226 --> 53:09.103
- You've become the ogre...
- Enough!

53:39.216 --> 53:41.885
Claire.

53:47.683 --> 53:48.767
Claire.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.436
Um...

53:53.647 --> 53:54.648
I...

53:56.358 --> 53:57.359
need, um...

54:02.531 --> 54:03.907
I need the ocean.

54:09.371 --> 54:14.126
I need time. I need space.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.463
I need perspective.

54:21.467 --> 54:23.010
I need to go.

54:25.721 --> 54:29.391
I need to go see my mom
and my <i>abuelita</i> in Havana.

54:30.267 --> 54:34.354
Don't. Don't. Don't leave.

54:36.773 --> 54:40.152
Look, if... if you want to talk...

54:55.042 --> 54:57.461
No, this isn't the time to talk now.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.091
See, um...

55:05.177 --> 55:07.304
that hole you just put in my wall...

55:09.973 --> 55:11.391
that was my childhood.

55:12.434 --> 55:15.103
That was my mother and my father,

55:15.187 --> 55:19.274
and, um... I said I would never...

55:20.609 --> 55:22.402
put myself through that again.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.113
I would never live with anger again.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.407
So, um...

55:32.412 --> 55:33.539
Look, you know...

55:35.541 --> 55:36.750
You know...

55:39.378 --> 55:42.881
I would never... hurt you.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.760
You know that, right?

55:58.230 --> 55:59.731
You need to go.

56:02.568 --> 56:03.652
Right now.

56:30.137 --> 56:32.097
I'm gonna be at the barbershop.

56:38.270 --> 56:41.106
Let's... Let's talk tomorrow,

56:41.898 --> 56:44.276
after we've both had some time to think.

56:52.576 --> 56:53.660
I love you.

56:59.124 --> 57:00.459
And I'm sorry.

57:50.175 --> 57:52.386
You told me stay out of your yard.

57:53.011 --> 57:55.472
But Harlem's not your yard, boy.

57:56.181 --> 57:57.307
It's mine.
