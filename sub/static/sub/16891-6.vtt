00:01.346 --> 00:03.043
Previously on "Rescue Me."

00:03.163 --> 00:07.448
I want you to be the
godfather to my new kid.

00:07.568 --> 00:08.500
I don't know what to say.

00:08.568 --> 00:10.301
Just say you'll go on a diet.

00:10.369 --> 00:11.668
It's the Celery Bible.

00:11.737 --> 00:13.770
Yogurt and appreciation.

00:13.839 --> 00:18.879
I am trying to uphold my half
of the godfather... bargain.

00:20.745 --> 00:24.380
It's just this thing that
happens to me when I have sex.

00:24.449 --> 00:30.053
The penetration hits a muscle back there
and, afterwards, it gives me gas.

00:30.122 --> 00:33.012
- Yeah, it's gross, I know.
- Hey, hey, don't say that.

00:34.893 --> 00:37.326
You guys want to hit your
careers and your reputations

00:37.395 --> 00:40.528
for Tommy's rebel asshole parade,
by all means, be my guest.

00:40.597 --> 00:42.363
And I'll tell you what, Lou, I
had a white or a blue shirt

00:42.432 --> 00:44.532
on with stripes on my arm, I bet
ya I can do a better job at

00:44.600 --> 00:46.300
keeping something like
this under the carpet.

00:46.368 --> 00:48.401
The new place that Sean and
Colleen were looking at for

00:48.470 --> 00:50.903
their wedding, they saw that
the last name was Gavin, that

00:50.972 --> 00:53.305
you were the firefighter who's
been in all the papers and...

00:53.374 --> 00:55.073
And they told them
both to take a hike.

00:55.142 --> 00:58.610
There's a place in Jersey near
where I take Damien

00:58.678 --> 01:00.212
in for his German aqua therapy.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.281
And then there's a place in
Connecticut near where I take

01:02.350 --> 01:03.549
him for his movement therapy.

01:03.617 --> 01:06.485
And they're both expensive.

01:06.554 --> 01:08.387
I want to pay.

01:08.456 --> 01:10.089
I want to pay for the
whole thing, ok?

01:10.158 --> 01:11.958
Nobody's had the balls to say
this to you, but I just got

01:12.026 --> 01:14.461
my balls back so I'm going to
say it, he ain't ever getting

01:14.530 --> 01:16.062
out of that wheelchair again.

01:16.131 --> 01:17.230
I got some news for you, too.

01:17.299 --> 01:19.466
Sheila is paying
for that wedding.

02:11.020 --> 02:12.053
Thank you.

02:12.122 --> 02:14.522
There you go.
I'll be right back to take your order.

02:14.590 --> 02:20.995
You know, I find it amazing
that 10 years after the worst

02:21.064 --> 02:25.483
attack ever perpetrated on
American soil, a decade later

02:25.603 --> 02:29.103
there's still not a standing monument
to everyone that died that day.

02:29.171 --> 02:31.105
Yeah. Do you want to know what
the only memorial down here is?

02:32.040 --> 02:35.509
On the side of ladder 10, all right?
Which was paid for

02:35.578 --> 02:38.646
privately and it only
mentions our guys.

02:38.715 --> 02:39.881
It's a travesty.

02:39.949 --> 02:41.148
It's politicians.

02:41.217 --> 02:42.650
Bullshit.

02:42.719 --> 02:45.586
It's typical.

02:45.655 --> 02:48.522
I went down to that
Vietnam wall once.

02:48.590 --> 02:50.623
You know, the one in Washington.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.892
It took me a long
time to go there.

02:52.961 --> 02:56.529
Years and years after
it was erected.

02:56.598 --> 02:58.931
I was afraid of it.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.203
I served with 10 guys who came
home in body bags, 3 guys who

03:03.272 --> 03:10.578
served under me, who I was responsible
for and their names are up on that wall.

03:10.646 --> 03:13.181
So, I didn't know how
I was going to react.

03:13.249 --> 03:19.554
People were crying and they had their
hands up on the wall, sobbing.

03:19.623 --> 03:23.624
Kids, parents, people
my own age collapsing.

03:23.693 --> 03:26.994
Shh. And me?

03:27.063 --> 03:29.964
Puh. Nothing.

03:30.032 --> 03:31.899
Stood there for a long time.

03:31.968 --> 03:33.034
It was nice.

03:33.102 --> 03:38.304
It was a nice big, impressive...wall.

03:39.842 --> 03:44.978
Walls, buildings, bridges,
they don't mean shit.

03:52.521 --> 03:57.958
Marty Sheehan, tough kid from Boston.
Loved hockey.

03:58.026 --> 04:04.052
Bobby, uh, Bobby Orr, was
God in his book. Heh!

04:06.903 --> 04:12.107
Joey Gianfredo, nice simple
kid from upstate New York.

04:12.176 --> 04:17.426
Kid cried himself to sleep some times,
but, boy, he was one crack shot. Heh!

04:21.551 --> 04:25.486
This--thank you.

04:25.555 --> 04:29.223
This is a letter
from Buck Chifford.

04:29.292 --> 04:33.827
He sent it to his wife and told
her to give it to me

04:33.896 --> 04:37.898
in case he didn't come home alive,
which he didn't.

04:37.967 --> 04:43.938
And in this letter he tells how
proud he was that I was his

04:44.007 --> 04:49.144
leader and that I shouldn't blame
myself for what happened to him...

04:49.213 --> 04:52.281
That he probably would have
come home dead a lot earlier if

04:52.350 --> 04:54.016
it hadn't been for me.

04:54.085 --> 05:00.089
So, the point is, walls are shit.

05:00.157 --> 05:01.857
You wanna memorialize somebody?

05:01.926 --> 05:05.127
You do it here and here.

05:05.195 --> 05:07.028
You talk about them.

05:07.097 --> 05:12.766
You tell all the young firefighters
what brave guys these guys were.

05:12.835 --> 05:14.401
Guys like my dad.

05:14.470 --> 05:16.002
Guys like your dad.

05:16.071 --> 05:18.772
They were part of the great
generation because they saved

05:18.840 --> 05:23.009
this country and the world.

05:23.078 --> 05:25.945
You can't memorialize somebody
by plastering their name up on

05:26.014 --> 05:28.881
a wall of concrete and steel.

05:28.950 --> 05:33.687
You do it by talking
about their deeds.

05:33.755 --> 05:37.991
You have to remember their
faces, their spirit.

05:38.060 --> 05:40.727
You have to remember the
firefighters on the morning of

05:40.796 --> 05:45.097
9/11 and what they did
before they went downtown.

05:45.166 --> 05:48.567
They memorialized themselves by
writing notes

05:48.636 --> 05:51.936
to their loved ones and leaving it in their
lockers, so that their wives

05:52.005 --> 05:56.274
and kids could read one last
time what these guys thought

05:56.343 --> 05:59.711
about them and cared about them.

05:59.779 --> 06:03.883
A lot of 'em didn't think they were
going to be coming back, you know.

06:03.952 --> 06:08.355
It takes a lot of balls to
do something like that.

06:08.424 --> 06:09.923
And this letter from Buck?

06:09.992 --> 06:13.661
Man, I'll tell ya, there's not a day
goes, not a single day goes by when I

06:13.730 --> 06:17.873
don't think about this guy and
what a brave, brave man he was.

06:21.870 --> 06:25.839
He was a real American hero.

06:25.908 --> 06:31.278
Hey, would you order me a
tuna melt with extra fries?

06:46.462 --> 06:50.865
â™ª On another day, c'mon,
c'mon, with these ropes tied

06:50.934 --> 06:52.934
tight, can we do no wrong?

06:53.003 --> 06:59.475
Now we grieve 'cause now it's gone,
things were good when we were young

06:59.543 --> 07:04.947
with my teeth bite down, I can see the
blood of a thousand men who have come

07:05.016 --> 07:11.653
and gone now we grieve 'cause now it's
gone things were good when we were

07:11.722 --> 07:14.123
young, is it safe to say?

07:14.191 --> 07:17.159
C'mon, c'mon was
it right to leave?

07:17.228 --> 07:20.262
C'mon, c'mon will I ever learn?

07:20.331 --> 07:26.101

[Clanging]

10:06.224 --> 10:08.157
Hello?

10:17.281 --> 10:19.170
[Door creaking]

10:51.705 --> 10:57.130
This is what you're looking for.
Look at it.

10:59.146 --> 11:01.780
Here.

11:01.849 --> 11:04.850
It's a letter my dad
wrote to my mom.

11:04.919 --> 11:08.778
He stuck it in a book in our old
house on a shelf in the living room.

11:09.176 --> 11:12.301
Figured one day she'd come
across it in case he died.

11:12.699 --> 11:14.858
And she did.

11:14.927 --> 11:21.790
2 months after, uh, well, you know,
after they found his finger.

11:31.312 --> 11:35.615
"My love, if you should find
this after I've passed away,

11:35.683 --> 11:40.969
let it find you knowing how truly,
madly and deeply I love you.

11:41.089 --> 11:45.959
How each one of my days began with me
looking at you and dreaming of more.

11:46.028 --> 11:48.995
And if I were not by your side
upon waking, I pictured your

11:49.064 --> 11:52.439
face, your eyes, your sweet..."

11:52.559 --> 11:55.067
What the hell are you doing?

11:55.136 --> 11:56.835
That's mine!

11:56.904 --> 11:58.670
I was...
That's private!

11:58.739 --> 12:00.372
What is wrong with you?

12:00.440 --> 12:03.808
Oh, my God.

12:03.877 --> 12:05.143
Get out!

12:05.212 --> 12:07.146
Get out of my bedroom!

12:07.214 --> 12:09.682
Ok. Ok, relax.

12:09.751 --> 12:13.420
What are you doing here?

12:13.488 --> 12:14.654
Get out!

12:14.723 --> 12:15.555
Ok.

12:15.624 --> 12:17.825
I...

12:23.600 --> 12:24.833
Uh!

12:24.902 --> 12:29.071
What the hell is going
on around here?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.206
Please tell me that you
haven't been drinking.

12:31.275 --> 12:33.709
What is this?
While you were watching my kid?

12:33.778 --> 12:35.144
I dunno, that's not mine.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.479
I don't know what that is.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.781
Ugh.

12:37.849 --> 12:39.816
I swear to God.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.665

It's ok, we're going to

12:51.230 --> 12:52.696
figure this out together, ok?

12:52.765 --> 12:56.200
Ow, ow. Ow.

12:57.178 --> 12:58.142
I don't smell anything.

12:58.262 --> 13:00.304
So, what?
You were just going to start now?

13:00.373 --> 13:07.378
No, I don't... I mean--my
personal--what were you thinking?

13:07.447 --> 13:11.816
I don't know.

13:11.884 --> 13:13.418
Here, here you go.

13:13.486 --> 13:14.541
Go on, take it.
Take it with you.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.153
- Ok, wait.
- Go on. Get out.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.574
I do not trust you to
watch him anymore.

13:17.694 --> 13:18.998
- Just wait.
- Get out!!

13:19.118 --> 13:20.336
Listen to me.

13:22.346 --> 13:27.765
I don't--I--I went down to ground zero.
I--I didn't think it was going to

13:27.834 --> 13:28.799
trigger anything.

13:28.868 --> 13:30.170
I mean, maybe it did.
Maybe it triggered something.

13:30.290 --> 13:31.502
I'm sorry.

13:31.571 --> 13:34.505
Oh, my God. Please go be
sorry somewhere else, huh?

Ahh.

[Sighing]

13:48.324 --> 13:52.024
I don't--I--I--ahh.

13:52.093 --> 13:55.128
Maybe this is one of those,
like those dry drunk things or

13:55.196 --> 13:56.162
something. I don't know.

13:56.231 --> 13:58.966
I mean, did you ever even
mention that letter to me or

13:59.034 --> 14:00.768
where you hid it or anything?

14:02.502 --> 14:06.373
Yes, I--yes, I mentioned
the letter to you.

14:06.442 --> 14:07.641
When?

14:07.710 --> 14:11.378
Like 5 years ago when you had
7 whiskies in you and we

14:11.447 --> 14:14.281
had that insane night
of sex on the beach.

14:14.350 --> 14:20.020
Remember? I had the lavender miniskirt
and the almost see- through top on?

14:20.088 --> 14:21.885
Anything?
Hello?

14:22.005 --> 14:23.189
[Laughing]

14:23.258 --> 14:24.924
Of course not.

14:24.993 --> 14:25.770
Ha ha.

14:25.890 --> 14:29.194
The sex you don't remember,
the see-through shirt and the

14:29.263 --> 14:33.998
moonlight, but somewhere in that
dark, dense, tangled mangle

14:34.067 --> 14:38.429
of a shit storm you dare to call a
brain, you remember the letter.

14:38.674 --> 14:42.118
Right? Because it pertains to you
and what you need right now.

14:42.238 --> 14:45.118
I never let you read that
letter because it is the truly

14:45.238 --> 14:51.547
only secret thing that Jimmy and I will
ever have ever again after he died.

14:51.616 --> 14:56.931
It's the only piece of him
that I get to keep for myself.

14:57.051 --> 14:59.684
It doesn't matter that
maybe he cheated.

14:59.804 --> 15:02.458
It doesn't matter how deep
things got between you and me.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.229
That letter is evidence of the
deepest connection that I will

15:06.298 --> 15:10.733
ever have with another
human being, ever.

15:11.039 --> 15:14.955
And you have crossed a
very dangerous line.

15:16.309 --> 15:17.808
Get out.

15:27.753 --> 15:29.653
Sheila. I...

15:35.160 --> 15:36.660
Got it.

15:44.237 --> 15:45.870
It's ok.

15:45.939 --> 15:47.572
[Door shuts]

15:47.641 --> 15:49.508
It's ok, it's ok.

15:59.274 --> 16:00.514
So, your girlfriend is a farter?

16:00.634 --> 16:03.779
No. She's not a--what you said.

16:04.052 --> 16:04.851
A farter.

16:04.919 --> 16:07.053
- Could we not use that term?
- Oh, you mean the term farter?

16:07.121 --> 16:08.921
- Yes.
- How about the term farte?

16:08.990 --> 16:10.790
- No.
- Farte, that's not bad.

16:10.858 --> 16:13.592
I mean, it has a nice little
French ring happening.

16:13.661 --> 16:15.260
Yeah, it kind of classes
it up a little.

16:15.329 --> 16:18.997
No. Nothing with the "f"
word in it, please. Jesus.

16:19.066 --> 16:20.031
What's going on?

16:20.100 --> 16:21.499
Garrity's girlfriend is a farter.

16:21.568 --> 16:22.967
Stop saying that.

16:23.036 --> 16:23.968
What do expect, kiddo, huh?

16:24.037 --> 16:25.604
You're supposed to keep this
thing to yourself, not blab

16:25.672 --> 16:27.306
it to all your friends.

16:27.374 --> 16:29.208
Where the hell is
your sense of shame?

16:29.277 --> 16:30.343
Here's the thing.

16:30.412 --> 16:31.945
I want to keep seeing
this chick, ok?

16:32.014 --> 16:34.247
She's really cool and funny and,
you know, she's like the most

16:34.316 --> 16:35.415
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

16:35.484 --> 16:37.317
Oh, yeah, well, she better be
on par with Gisele if you're

16:37.386 --> 16:39.352
gonna make yourself suffer
through that funky ass.

16:39.421 --> 16:40.787
- Mike?
- What?

16:40.856 --> 16:42.723
Will you please tell these
ass holes how hot she is?

16:42.791 --> 16:45.459
Yeah, guys, I mean,
she's pretty smokin'.

16:45.528 --> 16:46.693
Thank you.

16:46.762 --> 16:49.830
Yeah, and apparently she's also a, uh...
fartress.

16:49.898 --> 16:50.864
[Laughter]

16:50.932 --> 16:51.764
Hey, fartress.

16:51.833 --> 16:52.598
I saw that movie.

16:52.667 --> 16:53.733
Christopher Lambert was in it.

16:53.801 --> 16:54.767
[Laughter]

16:54.836 --> 16:56.536
So, let me get this straight,
if you guys break up,

16:56.604 --> 16:58.370
she would be the
fartress of solitude.

16:58.439 --> 16:59.138
Nice.

16:59.207 --> 17:01.928
Would you knock it off, please?
I'm being serious here.

17:02.048 --> 17:03.166
What do you want, advice from us?

17:03.286 --> 17:05.243
Yes. Jesus, I don't know why I
talk you guys about anything.

17:05.313 --> 17:06.055
Mikey!

17:06.175 --> 17:08.580
I mean, this is a serious problem for me.
I come to my closest friends and--

17:08.650 --> 17:12.051
[all shouting]

17:12.119 --> 17:13.887
That's great. That's amazing.

17:13.955 --> 17:14.921
All right.

[Sirens blasting]

17:19.861 --> 17:21.439
Yo, Lou, what's the good word?

17:21.559 --> 17:22.796
Someone reported a gas leak.

17:22.865 --> 17:25.031
Oh, shit, we going over to
Garrity's girlfriend's place?

17:25.101 --> 17:26.601
Very funny, black Shawn.

17:26.669 --> 17:29.537
Hey, you know, we're only a few blocks
away, you picking up her scent yet?

17:29.605 --> 17:31.338
Ok, hilarious, dick bags.

17:31.407 --> 17:34.709
You know what, odds are it's probably
just a bunch of paranoid yuppie assholes

17:34.778 --> 17:36.778
smelling the gas from
their pilot light again.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.147
Yep, goddamn yuppies.
You gotta love 'em.

17:39.216 --> 17:40.915
Hey, maybe we should bring
Garrity's girlfriend by,

17:40.984 --> 17:43.084
let them know what a real
gas leak smells like.

17:43.153 --> 17:44.686
You know, I don't know why
I tell you guys anything.

17:44.755 --> 17:45.987

Hello?

17:49.259 --> 17:49.991
[Sirens in background]

17:50.060 --> 17:52.660
It doesn't smell much
like gas in here.

17:52.729 --> 17:53.762
And he's the authority.

17:53.830 --> 17:54.563
Ok.

17:54.632 --> 17:55.597
Hello?

17:55.666 --> 17:56.998
F.D.N.Y.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.333

17:58.402 --> 18:02.571

you hear us knock?

Hello?

18:10.916 --> 18:14.985
Hello.

18:15.054 --> 18:17.121
Oh, shit.

18:17.189 --> 18:19.056
How long do you think
they've been here?

18:19.125 --> 18:20.925
Long enough.

18:20.994 --> 18:23.761
Check their pulses,
will you, Mike?

18:23.830 --> 18:24.862
They're dead, Lou.

18:24.931 --> 18:26.130
I got it.

18:26.199 --> 18:28.266
Go down and check the
boiler then, will ya?

18:28.334 --> 18:30.101
Guys, let's open some
windows in here.

18:54.894 --> 18:56.729

Oh, God. What time is it?

21:12.219 --> 21:14.152
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What are you doing?

21:14.221 --> 21:16.388
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Get out of my room.

Ohh. Jesus.

22:19.099 --> 22:20.847
I didn't think it
could get any better.

22:20.967 --> 22:21.841
And yet it did.

[Hissing]

You see all that grass out front?

22:47.832 --> 22:52.020
Just like Central Park without the taxis,
horse shit, and homeless people.

22:52.089 --> 22:53.610
Wow.
[Whistles] Look at this view.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.823

Sheila.

22:58.261 --> 22:59.326
[Laughing]

22:59.395 --> 23:02.229
So, I was thinking maybe
like the altar over here.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.330
Right, right, right.

23:03.399 --> 23:04.599

23:05.669 --> 23:09.871
Honey, what's the matter?

23:09.940 --> 23:15.313
Um, it's just this is so
beautiful and so expensive.

23:15.433 --> 23:17.027
Ok, I can't have
you pay for this.

23:17.147 --> 23:20.217
Oh, honey, money
is not a problem.

23:20.337 --> 23:21.494
How can you say that?

23:21.614 --> 23:23.685
I mean, with all you have
on your plate with Damian.

23:23.754 --> 23:29.014
Listen, I may not be a financial...
Oh.

23:32.629 --> 23:38.600
I may not be a financial wizard,
but my business manager is.

23:38.669 --> 23:42.737
And I'm not going to be
throwing away any more cabbage

23:42.806 --> 23:45.126
on miracle cures for Damian.

23:45.246 --> 23:51.479
I've had to accept
that and him as he is.

23:51.548 --> 23:55.083
And, you know, it breaks my
heart that I'm never going to

23:55.152 --> 23:57.609
be able to give him a wedding.

23:57.729 --> 24:03.118
But that is why you have got to
accept this gift on his behalf.

24:04.370 --> 24:08.429
But I mean, it's just so hard,
aunt Sheila, because it just--

24:08.498 --> 24:10.427
I mean, this does not feel like us.

24:10.547 --> 24:15.646
It's so peaceful, so
polished, and so classy.

24:15.766 --> 24:17.504
So, un-Gavin.

24:17.573 --> 24:19.440
Hmm.

24:19.509 --> 24:21.810
Put an open bar and a dance
floor over there, it's going to

24:21.878 --> 24:23.711
get plenty Gavin, plenty quick.

24:23.780 --> 24:27.782
Now, sit down with me for a sec.

24:27.851 --> 24:31.453
Oh, yeah.

24:31.522 --> 24:34.857
Give me your hand.

24:34.925 --> 24:37.192
I want this for you.

24:37.261 --> 24:41.039
And your Uncle Jimmy would want this
for you. You want to know why?

24:43.090 --> 24:46.656
Because marriage is really hard.

24:48.939 --> 24:53.942
And you are going to want this
one day to look back on and

24:54.011 --> 24:58.814
remember how happy you were and
hoped you always would be.

24:58.883 --> 25:02.101
And then you try to be
that happy all over again.

25:02.221 --> 25:04.853
And that works?

25:04.922 --> 25:07.656
What the hell do I know?
I had my reception at the VFW,

25:07.725 --> 25:09.591
but it sounds like it works.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.708
[Laughter]

25:11.828 --> 25:13.995
You're the best, aunt Sheila.

I know I am.

25:16.733 --> 25:18.266

25:29.447 --> 25:30.646
Hey.

25:30.715 --> 25:31.830
Hey.

25:31.950 --> 25:32.871
Do me a favor, would ya?

25:32.991 --> 25:34.631
I got this thing in the
middle of my back.

25:34.751 --> 25:37.401
I'm not sure if it's a boil or
one of those really huge like

25:37.521 --> 25:40.625
volcano-sized zits.

25:40.693 --> 25:42.959
I mean, I think this thing
should be listed on some kind

25:43.028 --> 25:45.588
of geological survey somewhere,
but I can't quite see it.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.883
Do me a favor, just look
and tell me what it is.

25:48.003 --> 25:51.001
- No.
- Come on, you're my best friend.

25:51.069 --> 25:53.203
All right, lift your
shirt up real quick.

25:53.272 --> 25:55.189
Ow.

25:55.694 --> 25:57.623
- Oh, holy shit.
- What? Boil?

25:57.743 --> 26:00.008
- Tumor.
- Serious?

26:00.077 --> 26:04.399
It's going to involve puss at some
point and probably some lancing.

26:04.519 --> 26:06.081
Oh, thank you.

26:06.150 --> 26:07.416
Phew.

26:07.485 --> 26:09.410
Hey, uh, listen, on the
best friend front?

26:09.530 --> 26:10.854
Yeah, I'm not blowing you.

26:10.923 --> 26:11.659
Ok.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.558
That's why we're never going
to get our own reality show.

26:14.627 --> 26:19.097
I, uh...I wrote some letters.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.532
Uh-oh.

26:20.601 --> 26:22.820
- Uh-oh?
- Yeah.

26:22.940 --> 26:25.052
Did you, um, write
them in crayon?

26:25.297 --> 26:27.379
No, I carved them in stone.

26:27.499 --> 26:29.305
Ha, that's really funny, but
the last time that you wrote

26:29.425 --> 26:31.020
letters, Tom, they were to the
mayor's office when they were

26:31.140 --> 26:33.077
shutting down all
those firehouses.

26:33.145 --> 26:36.547
And because of your drunken
pigeon scrawl, you caused a lot

26:36.615 --> 26:39.564
of confusion because every time you wrote
the word truck, they thought it was...

26:39.684 --> 26:41.630
I know what they thought it was, ok?
This is different.

26:41.750 --> 26:46.064
I--I--I took my time, make
sure they were legible.

26:46.184 --> 26:47.324
Uh-huh.

26:47.393 --> 26:51.461
Listen, I kind of took what
Feinberg was saying the other day

26:51.530 --> 26:56.121
to heart about, you know,
what some of the guys did

26:56.458 --> 27:00.183
on 9/11, writing notes to their
families before they jumped in

27:00.303 --> 27:02.969
their rigs to go
down--go down there.

27:03.089 --> 27:06.887
So, I just thought maybe I'd,
you know, let Janet and the kids know,

27:07.331 --> 27:14.151
you know, my...
how I felt about them, you know, so

27:14.220 --> 27:16.678
that if I don't come home from
work one night, they have

27:16.798 --> 27:19.310
something that tells them
forever how I, you know...

27:20.692 --> 27:24.795
And who better than my best
friend, you know, somebody I--

27:24.864 --> 27:26.983
the only person on this
planet I trust implicitly...

27:27.103 --> 27:29.708
I want you to be in
charge of those.

27:29.828 --> 27:32.771
And there's also one in there
for the new kid in case

27:32.840 --> 27:38.211
I get killed in the line of duty
before he or she arrives.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.580
Did you, uh, type them?

27:40.649 --> 27:42.716
Yeah, I typed them.

27:42.785 --> 27:44.707
Who do you know that
has a typewriter?

27:44.827 --> 27:46.905
A computer is a typewriter, Tom.

27:49.358 --> 27:51.725
I know, I know, you're still
trying to deal with the concept

27:51.794 --> 27:53.961
of a disposable lighter.

27:54.030 --> 27:56.430
Um, let me ask you a question.

27:56.499 --> 27:59.452
You want me to give these like a
proof read so that, you know,

27:59.572 --> 28:03.705
Katy doesn't spend 2 days trying to figure
out why her dad told her to go truck herself?

28:03.773 --> 28:04.706
No, ok.

28:04.775 --> 28:06.206
I just said they're private.

28:06.326 --> 28:10.400
- They're, you know...Do not read them.
- I won't. I will not read them.

28:11.384 --> 28:13.115
Or these.

28:13.183 --> 28:15.217
Jesus Christ, how many are there?

28:15.286 --> 28:17.879
I wrote one to Sheila 'cause she's
kind of pissed at me right now.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.314
- Ok.
- And Damian.

28:19.434 --> 28:23.007
- Ok.
- And Mickey and Teddy.

28:23.127 --> 28:23.959
Ok.

28:24.027 --> 28:27.729
And Maggie and my cousin Eddie
and my brother Timo and

28:27.798 --> 28:32.238
my sister Rosemary and Needles and,
uh, you know, each one of the guys.

28:32.358 --> 28:34.686
But nobody reads anything.

28:34.806 --> 28:35.620
How am I going to read them?

28:35.740 --> 28:39.269
What do I have a week at
the beach free? Jesus.

28:39.389 --> 28:42.793
- All right, well, just--nobody reads these.
- Nobody reads them.

28:43.037 --> 28:44.472
- You got it.
- Ok.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.019
All right, so we're clear.

28:47.139 --> 28:48.469
Yes.

28:51.783 --> 28:52.951
Safe and sound.

28:53.071 --> 28:54.071
Appreciate it.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.591
No problem.

"Dear Lou, I'm not around anymore,
so knowing that might be the case,

29:25.831 --> 29:27.786
I wanted to take the time to tell you

29:27.906 --> 29:31.802
how I really feel about you, not only
as a lifelong friend, but as

29:31.922 --> 29:34.299
the guardian of my
beloved children.

29:34.649 --> 29:38.805
You fat, undisciplined piece of shit. Couldn't
wait to get your hands on this, could ya?

29:38.925 --> 29:41.821
I'm still alive and kicking and
you're already reading this?

29:41.889 --> 29:45.101
I wouldn't trust you to pick up my dry
cleaning, never mind watch my kids.

29:45.221 --> 29:47.741
Do not even try to act
like you never read this.

And stay away from the stash
of red velvet cupcakes

I have hidden under my bed
in the bunk room.

29:52.869 --> 29:53.901
I got them for Janet.

29:53.970 --> 29:55.633
She's been talking about
them for days now.

29:55.753 --> 29:59.016
Can't keep them in the house because the
kids will--what am I talking about?

29:59.136 --> 30:00.975
You're not even reading
this anymore, are you?

30:01.044 --> 30:02.143
Ahh.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.911
Asshole."

[Grunting]

31:04.175 --> 31:05.041
Hi.

31:05.110 --> 31:06.100
I didn't eat any.

31:06.220 --> 31:08.211
No, you didn't have time
to eat any, did ya?

31:08.280 --> 31:08.979
Unbelievable.

31:09.048 --> 31:12.483
You were parked under my bunk like a motor
head stuck under a '67 Ford Mustang.

31:12.551 --> 31:13.484
You know what?

31:13.553 --> 31:14.685
You can't be trusted.

31:14.754 --> 31:15.703
I knew you wouldn't
keep a promise.

31:15.823 --> 31:17.655
You're not on any goddamn diet.

31:17.724 --> 31:18.590
Bullshit, Tom.

31:18.659 --> 31:19.658
Yeah, let me show you something.

31:19.727 --> 31:22.461
You know those cooking classes that I'm
taking up at cooking school, which is

31:22.530 --> 31:23.929
actually a culinary institute?

31:23.998 --> 31:25.368
- Oh, really? It's an institute?
- Yeah.

31:25.488 --> 31:27.621
They happen to give out report cards.
And you know what?

31:27.741 --> 31:29.732
Look at that, straight
goddamn "A's."

31:29.852 --> 31:32.639
And, meanwhile, you run to
my bed digging out cupcakes?

31:32.708 --> 31:34.864
You know, I should have known this
whole goddamn thing was a trap.

31:34.984 --> 31:38.977
A creepy ass Tommy Gavin,
Stephen King, 9/11 nightmare.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.081
Yeah.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.950
Why don't you just shut up, Tom?
For the love of God, will you just shut

31:43.019 --> 31:44.118
your goddamn mouth?

31:44.187 --> 31:50.820
I am so sick and tired of
you and this 9/11 bullshit.

31:52.562 --> 31:56.669
We lost 343 guys that
day, Tom, officially.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.366
Officially.

31:58.434 --> 32:00.329
But let's be honest.

32:00.449 --> 32:02.203
Look at the two of us.

32:02.272 --> 32:05.707
I got a hole inside of me the
size of that crater downtown

32:05.775 --> 32:07.087
that I've been filling
up with food.

32:07.207 --> 32:09.704
And you got a hole inside of you, too,
that you've been filling up with booze.

32:09.824 --> 32:11.428
I haven't had a drink--
No, shh, shh.

32:11.548 --> 32:14.248
I have not had a drink--
Tom. Shh. What are you going to tell me, Tom?

32:14.317 --> 32:16.880
That that bottle of vodka I
saw in the back seat of your truck

32:17.000 --> 32:19.487
coming here today is cologne?

32:19.555 --> 32:23.612
You've been walking around like a dry
drunk for days on end around the joint.

32:23.732 --> 32:26.553
Writing letters and
preparing yourself to die.

32:26.673 --> 32:31.732
I got news for you, pal, you're
already dead and I am, too.

32:31.801 --> 32:33.806
We're both walking dead men.

32:33.926 --> 32:35.703
We're zombies, Tom.

32:35.772 --> 32:39.740
Forget about 343.

32:40.332 --> 32:42.876
You add in all the other guys
in all the other houses and

32:42.945 --> 32:45.112
all of the brain cells that
we've killed and all the

32:45.181 --> 32:46.981
marriages that we've destroyed.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.293
All the kids whose dads have
that blank stare on their face

32:51.413 --> 32:54.655
for the past decade.

32:54.724 --> 32:57.292
And all those zombies still
riding around on their rigs

32:57.360 --> 33:04.546
for 10 years, Tom, 10 years, trying to
fill in the holes inside of them. 343.

33:04.666 --> 33:07.268
That number ain't even close.

33:08.640 --> 33:12.240
So, do what you got to do, Tom.

33:12.308 --> 33:13.841
Go downtown.

33:13.910 --> 33:18.055
Bury yourself in that hole
and make it official.

33:18.361 --> 33:20.915
Make it 344.

33:20.984 --> 33:25.086
Just for God sakes, just get it
over with, Tom, so

33:25.155 --> 33:30.628
the rest of us can go back to leading our
quiet little zombie lives.

33:32.529 --> 33:34.095
[Sighs]

33:46.443 --> 33:47.876
Tom?

33:47.945 --> 33:51.180
[Sighs]

33:51.248 --> 33:53.749
Tom?

33:53.818 --> 33:58.220
Tommy?

33:58.289 --> 33:59.822
Oh, no.

33:59.890 --> 34:01.824
No, you don't.

34:01.893 --> 34:04.460
Yeah, yeah.

34:04.529 --> 34:06.996
[Door slams]

34:07.064 --> 34:08.330
What the hell are you guys doing?

34:08.449 --> 34:10.966
- What? Just stretching.
- Nothing.

34:11.034 --> 34:12.348
Hey, Frankie.

34:14.371 --> 34:16.405
What's his problem?

34:16.474 --> 34:18.484
Beats me.

34:18.603 --> 34:19.754
What?

34:19.873 --> 34:21.143
What?

34:21.212 --> 34:24.373
Hey, you forgot your
cupcakes, asshole.

34:24.494 --> 34:27.328
Something to wash
down your vodka with.

34:27.589 --> 34:29.184
Scumbag.

34:29.253 --> 34:30.319
Lou?

34:30.388 --> 34:32.487
Are you seriously standing
here in broad daylight with a

34:32.556 --> 34:34.824
handful of cupcakes after all
the arguments we've had?

34:34.891 --> 34:36.058
What is all the racket about?

34:36.127 --> 34:39.428
Well, uh, apparently, Tommy's
fallen off the wagon and Lou is

34:39.496 --> 34:41.362
back on the chuck wagon.
That's what it's about.

34:41.482 --> 34:42.931
What?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.520
These are Tommy's.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.935
Well, hello, Tommy's fix
is booze, not donuts.

34:48.004 --> 34:48.869
Lou?

34:48.938 --> 34:50.036
Yeah?

34:50.106 --> 34:52.339
Did my vacation time clear yet?

34:52.408 --> 34:53.606
What are you talking about?

34:53.675 --> 34:54.706
My honeymoon.

34:54.775 --> 34:57.743
Remember? I gave you the
papers over 2 weeks ago?

34:57.812 --> 34:59.806
Come on, man, please, do not
tell me you didn't...

34:59.926 --> 35:01.090
Classic.
It's classic.

35:01.210 --> 35:01.963
Hey, shut up, you.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.682
All right? I remember.

35:03.751 --> 35:05.818
What the hell do you want
to go to Mexico for anyway?

35:05.887 --> 35:10.222
So he can be the tallest guy
in the room for a change.

35:10.291 --> 35:14.125
Listen, Lou, all right,
flights are booked.

35:14.194 --> 35:17.081
We leave in one week--one
week after the wedding.

35:17.201 --> 35:18.885
- Really simple, man.
- I don't know what to tell ya.

35:19.005 --> 35:20.859
Well, why don't you tell me you're
going to put down the goddamn cupcakes--

35:20.979 --> 35:23.700
I'll put down the goddamn
cupcakes, all right?

35:23.769 --> 35:25.886
You guys have been riding me
about that shit for so long and

35:26.006 --> 35:30.107
I went and I took some classes, ok?
Learn how to eat healthier, cook healthier.

35:30.175 --> 35:31.008
And you want to know something?

35:31.076 --> 35:34.411
I got my report card today and
got straight "A's," all right?

35:34.480 --> 35:36.079
Magna cum laude.

35:36.148 --> 35:37.513
So, suck it.

35:37.582 --> 35:38.948
Ok, skinny Minnie.

35:39.016 --> 35:41.016
How much weight have
you lost so far?

35:41.085 --> 35:42.017
It's a process.

35:42.086 --> 35:43.085
It's a process.

35:43.154 --> 35:43.950
Hey, give me that back.

35:44.070 --> 35:47.022
- All right, all right, come on.
- Holy shit. Wait.

35:47.091 --> 35:49.388
Advanced cupcake, "A" plus.

35:49.508 --> 35:51.394
Donuts of the world, "A" plus.

35:51.463 --> 35:54.630
Holy cannoli, "A" plus.

35:54.699 --> 35:56.999
Cookies unlimited, "A" plus.

35:57.068 --> 35:59.668
Mastering mousse, "B" minus.

35:59.737 --> 36:01.704
I ate my final project.

36:01.773 --> 36:03.201
You know what, man?
We're over you, all right?

36:03.321 --> 36:05.709
- We're over you, all right, Lou, enough.
- I know you're upset.

36:05.777 --> 36:07.544
I know you're--
He forgot to file some papers, all right.

36:07.613 --> 36:09.065
This is not the end of the world.

36:09.185 --> 36:11.249
Yeah, chief, but come on, you
pile this on top of all the

36:11.317 --> 36:14.141
other crap, it's like looking at a mountain
of bullshit, all right? Let's be honest.

36:14.261 --> 36:16.409
This is definitely the straw that
broke the Puerto Rican's back.

36:16.529 --> 36:20.392
You think you can do
better, huh, hotshot?

36:20.460 --> 36:22.738
You think you can do better
running this place than I do?

36:22.858 --> 36:24.962
Wading through all the
bureaucratic bullshit

36:25.031 --> 36:27.865
that I have to do all the paperwork,
all the legal wrangling?

36:27.934 --> 36:29.867
You think you can
do better than me?

36:29.936 --> 36:32.469
If I don't have to bake cupcakes at the
same time, yeah, it should be good.

36:32.538 --> 36:33.637
Ha ha ha.

36:33.706 --> 36:36.139
Oh, you know what, I would love
to give you the keys to the kingdom

36:36.208 --> 36:36.986
for a couple of days.

36:37.106 --> 36:39.113
Chief, is that all
right with you?

36:40.078 --> 36:41.178
5 days.

36:41.246 --> 36:42.279
Oh, jeez.

36:42.348 --> 36:43.380
Now, you're--quiet.

36:43.449 --> 36:46.016
You're acting lieutenant for 5 days.
However, all decisions

36:46.085 --> 36:47.807
- must run through me, you understand?
- Cool.

36:47.927 --> 36:49.430
This is going to be good for you.
You're going to see what it's like.

36:49.550 --> 36:50.363
I agree.

36:50.483 --> 36:53.758
20, 60.
I got 60 bucks on my man Franco.

36:53.827 --> 36:55.093
[All talking at once]

36:55.162 --> 36:56.929
I got 20 on Franc.
Sorry, man.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.865
I hate to take money from children,
I have a "C" note on Lou.

36:59.934 --> 37:01.400
The keys to the kingdom.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.702
May the best man win...
Lieutenant.

37:03.770 --> 37:05.058
Thank you, firefighter chef.

37:05.178 --> 37:06.671
Yeah, firefighter chef.

37:06.740 --> 37:09.110
- I got 20 on Franco.
- No, no, no, no. No, you don't.

37:09.401 --> 37:12.777
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

37:12.845 --> 37:13.677
What?

37:13.746 --> 37:16.647
You got a little something on your...
You got it.

37:16.715 --> 37:21.685
[Laughter]

37:21.753 --> 37:25.388
[Sighs]

37:25.457 --> 37:27.724
Yeah.

37:37.036 --> 37:38.702
Shit.

37:59.090 --> 38:00.358
[Engine revving]

38:09.437 --> 38:10.704
[Engine stops]

38:20.116 --> 38:21.382
[Shouting and screaming]

38:29.125 --> 38:31.391
[Loud rumbling]

38:31.460 --> 38:33.059
[People screaming]

38:38.399 --> 38:41.334
[Coughing and screaming]

38:41.402 --> 38:44.004
[Loud rumbling]

38:44.072 --> 38:49.677
[People screaming throughout]

38:49.746 --> 38:51.179
[Loud booming]

39:21.880 --> 39:23.214
[Gasps]

39:38.332 --> 39:39.198
[Knocking]

39:39.266 --> 39:41.166
Hey, you got a dollar?

39:41.235 --> 39:44.982
Uh... hey, man, you all right?

39:46.473 --> 39:47.905
Yeah.

39:47.974 --> 39:49.180
Ahem.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.241
Yeah.

39:58.150 --> 39:59.875
There you go.

40:01.486 --> 40:02.786
This shit real?

40:02.906 --> 40:05.421
Oh, yeah, it's real.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.257
[Laughing]

40:13.098 --> 40:14.431
