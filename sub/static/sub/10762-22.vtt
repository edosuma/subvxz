WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:09.576
What is this?

00:10.076 --> 00:13.580
"St. Osric's Prekindergarten Academy and Daycare Center"?

00:14.080 --> 00:17.083
Do I hear the pitter-patter
of petite elite feet?

00:17.083 --> 00:18.985
No, no, no.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.387
It's just that
the wait list

00:20.387 --> 00:22.389
for St. Osric's
is up to four years,
Oh.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.864
so I thought we should
get our application
in now to be safe.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.593
Very wise, Niles.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.095
You know, Lilith and I waited
until Frederick was conceived

00:29.095 --> 00:30.563
before we enrolled him
in private school.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.365
Mr. Procrastinator.
Well, you know.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.767
It's prekindergarten--

00:33.767 --> 00:35.769
they run around,
they sing, they nap.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.270
How special
can St. Osric's really be?

00:37.704 --> 00:41.141
Well, I hear the top two percent
in coloring and putting away

00:41.141 --> 00:42.942
can pretty much
write their own ticket.

00:44.744 --> 00:48.248
Oh, Niles, guess
who's coming to visit.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.582
Leland Barton.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.451
Really? From the Empire Club?

00:51.885 --> 00:52.952
No, no. That's Barton Leland
.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.722
Leland Barton was Mom's research assistant.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.424
They worked together closely
for years.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.225
I don't remember him.
Oh, that's right.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.094
We were just boys
when he moved to France.

01:01.594 --> 01:02.595
Apparently he
gave up psychiatry

01:03.096 --> 01:04.964
and immersed himself
in the Paris art world.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.332
Today,

01:06.766 --> 01:10.603
he sits on the board of
the Paris Museum of Modern Art.

01:10.804 --> 01:14.874
Wow. Takes a brave man
to just chuck it all,
Mm.

01:14.874 --> 01:17.877
cross the ocean in pursuit
of a new life in a new country.

01:18.378 --> 01:18.812
Or a brave woman.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.313
Oh, yes,
that's absolutely right.

01:20.814 --> 01:21.781
That's exactly
what you did.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.149
Just like Dr. Barton,

01:23.149 --> 01:25.652
you bade farewell to
the comforts of hearth and home

01:25.652 --> 01:28.455
and filled your sails with the
winds of change and adventure.

01:28.721 --> 01:30.290
Well, I never looked at it
that way.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.792
Now I'll have something
to think about this afternoon

01:32.792 --> 01:34.794
when I'm rubbing
your dad's bum.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.299
(sighs)

01:42.902 --> 01:44.471
Hello, Roz
Hi.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.172
Hey, Roz.
How was the dog park?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.007
Well, I got a phone number.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.309
Oh, nice.

01:49.576 --> 01:52.378
Is that why you people
have pets-- to get dates?

01:52.645 --> 01:53.713
No, but it's a plus.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.215
I've never met one person

01:55.715 --> 01:58.718
who didn't get at least one date through their pet.

01:58.718 --> 02:01.187
Well, meet me.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.189
Four years in high school

02:03.189 --> 02:05.692
and not a single encounter
generated.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.026
Stupid fish.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.895
(doorbell rings)

02:09.895 --> 02:11.397
Oh, that would be Leland.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.399
Who's Leland?
He was Hester's
research assistant.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.368
Used to follow her around
like a puppy.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.705
I think he was always a little
bit jealous of me, to be honest.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.408
Not that he was alone.

02:23.843 --> 02:24.878
Dr. Barton

02:25.345 --> 02:26.679
Hello, Frasier.
I'm Frasier.
Good to see you.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.515
How are you?
Let me take that for you.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.016
Thank you very much.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.018
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.786
My God, look at you!

02:33.987 --> 02:35.455
I haven't seen you
since you were about, what,

02:35.822 --> 02:36.890
seven years old?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.892
And you still look good
in a suit.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.260
Oh...

02:40.627 --> 02:43.696
Martin, you have not
changed a whit.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.698
Oh, my hair's gray,
and I got a bullet in my hip.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.201
Well, I'm bigger and balder,

02:48.201 --> 02:49.569
but I don't want
to hear about it.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.172
But you look exactly
the same, too.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.406
Thank you, sir.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.375
And you must be...?

02:55.742 --> 02:58.811
I'm assuming you don't go by Niles anymore.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.550
No, this-this is my producer,
Roz Doyle.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.484
My brother's not here.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.419
Oh...

03:06.419 --> 03:08.454
(chuckles)

03:08.454 --> 03:09.455
My sincerest apologies.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.957
You are a handsome woman.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.192
Oh.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.093
And it's nice to meet you, too

03:14.093 --> 03:15.495
I guess I should be going.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.930
Oh, not on my
account, I hope.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.264
FRASIER:
Please, Roz,
stay if you like.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.432
Can I get anybody a drink?

03:19.732 --> 03:21.301
Well, not unless you happen
to have any sherry.

03:21.734 --> 03:22.268
(chuckles heartily)

03:22.735 --> 03:26.306
I think I can
scare up a glass. Roz?

03:26.306 --> 03:27.774
Well, I'll have
a beer, please.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.243
Well, I can handle that.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.644
Come, sit down.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.146
Well, thank you.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.181
So, I hear you worked
with Frasier's mom.

03:35.181 --> 03:36.182
Yes, I did

03:36.182 --> 03:37.150
Did you know her?

03:37.550 --> 03:38.451
No.
Oh, pity.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.287
She was a remarkable woman.

03:41.287 --> 03:44.791
Brilliant, playful...
and passionate.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.626
I adored her.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.794
FRASIER:
Here we are.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.129
Welcome back to Seattle.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.130
Thank you.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.632
There we are.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.634
(chuckles)

03:56.636 --> 03:57.637
(sighs)

03:57.637 --> 03:58.638
This sherry
is exquisite.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.139
Oh, thank you.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.575
It's an Andalusian Amontilla
do I'm rather fond of.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.510
A connoisseur.
I am very surprised.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.913
Most Americans think that sherry
is just for cooking.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.848
Oh, my brother and I have
always had a taste for it.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.350
Well, you didn't get that from me.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.851
I've always hated the stuff.

04:11.851 --> 04:14.187
You know, come to think of it,
so did your mom.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.400 --> 04:30.169
Can I help you?

04:30.169 --> 04:31.271
I'm sorry about that.

04:31.271 --> 04:31.971
Eddie, down.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.613
Wh-Why is he doing that?

04:40.613 --> 04:41.881
I don't really know.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.883
He used to do it to me, but,
uh... I tell you what,

04:44.384 --> 04:46.386
just don't get
in a staring contest with him.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.287
That's what he wants.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.055
MARTIN:
Come on, Eddie, get down.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.024
I'm sorry. I don't know
what got into him.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.358
I'll get him a treat.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.693
Frasier, this is remarkable.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.529
You and I seem to have
the same taste in art.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.731
Rauschenberg, Otterson

04:58.731 --> 05:01.034
African statuary and sculpture.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.535
Although I...

05:02.535 --> 05:04.871
I must confess,
I'm not familiar with that one

05:04.871 --> 05:07.206
Oh, that's because
while most Azande statues

05:07.206 --> 05:09.208
are intended
to ward off evil spirits,

05:09.208 --> 05:10.710
this one was designed
to distract me

05:11.210 --> 05:13.713
while my pockets were picked
at the Kinshasa Airport.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.082
(laughing)

05:20.153 --> 05:22.221
You two have a lot in common.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.058
Psychiatry and sherry and art...

05:25.325 --> 05:26.893
And furniture.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.362
That is a Coco Chanel sofa,

05:29.796 --> 05:30.363
unless I'm mistaken.

05:30.863 --> 05:31.798
It is an exact

05:31.798 --> 05:33.366
replica of the one
in her Paris atelier.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.201
You know, not many people even notice it.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.537
Well, not many people
have passed out drunk

05:37.537 --> 05:38.905
on the original.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.407
Oh, I would love
to hear that story.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.842
Well, you are in luck,

05:43.209 --> 05:44.677
because I love
to tell it.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.846
But first,
let me thank you

05:47.046 --> 05:48.614
for making me feel
so welcome.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.616
I must confess,
I had some reservations

05:51.117 --> 05:52.618
about returning to Seattle.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.120
But you have
dispelled them all.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.121
To you.

05:55.621 --> 05:56.122
Ah...

05:57.623 --> 05:59.092
Mmm.
Mmm. Please.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.600
Mmm.
Mmm.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.182
What's the matter?

06:23.182 --> 06:24.484
Nothing.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.326
NILES:
Okay, we just need

06:33.826 --> 06:35.828
to fill in a name

06:35.828 --> 06:38.331
and I can get the application
over to St. Osric's.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.832
How can we have a name?

06:39.832 --> 06:41.100
I'm not even pregnant yet.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.368
You know, it's not the name.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.236
It's just a placeholder.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.637
Anything will do.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.940
Mm, all right,
how about, uh... Simon?

06:48.141 --> 06:51.577
As in your-brother-with-the-
substance-abuse-problem Simon?

06:51.577 --> 06:54.981
There are other Simons,
you know.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.985
Simon Templar, Simon Legree,
Simon Chipmunk.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.988
You're not exactly
building a case for Simon.

07:01.988 --> 07:02.989
Um, how about Jill?

07:02.989 --> 07:04.457
No, don't like it.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.760
That's the name of that
weather tart on channel eight.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.562
All right, let's just
pick a name at random.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.997
Oh, like, out of the phone book.

07:10.997 --> 07:11.998
Oh, that's
a good idea,

07:11.998 --> 07:13.499
and leave it to fate.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.834
Okay...

07:14.834 --> 07:17.170
When I stop, you point.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.142
"Bob."
Great.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.482
Bob...

07:29.482 --> 07:31.350
Crane. Okay.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.121
Going to need some whiteout.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.892
LELAND:
Oh, listen to me,

07:39.892 --> 07:41.861
I've been talking your ears off for the past hour

07:41.861 --> 07:42.862
about psychiatry.

07:42.862 --> 07:43.863
MARTIN:
Yeah, really.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.365
Oh, Roz, do you mind
if we join you?

07:46.365 --> 07:47.366
Oh, yeah, not at all.

07:47.366 --> 07:48.668
Hi, Roz.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.369
Leland, it is
such a pleasure

07:50.937 --> 07:53.372
to talk shop
with a fellow nutcracker.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.941
And talking to you "Jung" people

07:55.441 --> 07:56.943
makes me feel like an "id" again.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.411
(laughing)

07:58.411 --> 07:59.846
Do you have a pun,
Frasier?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.114
Uh, no.
Let's just sit down, huh?

08:10.790 --> 08:11.791
What's wrong?

08:11.791 --> 08:12.792
Nothing.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.193
Oh, you know,
there is

08:14.193 --> 08:16.062
a wonderful Brassai exhibit
in town.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.897
What do you say we
stop over there after lunch?

08:17.897 --> 08:18.731
I would love that.

08:19.232 --> 08:19.732
I'm a big fan.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.234
Oh, I wish
I could join you.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.568
I have patients
all afternoon.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.804
Don't suppose you'd be willing to go now would you?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.540
Fine by me
Certainly.
Let's get coffee at the museum

08:27.907 --> 08:31.344
Dad, Roz, any chance
you'd like to take in some

08:31.644 --> 08:34.145
Parisian photos by
 an old Romanian master?

08:34.480 --> 08:36.549
Mmmm... no

08:36.549 --> 08:38.417
Thanks anyway.

08:38.717 --> 08:39.251
Okay..

08:39.751 --> 08:40.586
Oh, excuse me.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.488
Your father forgot
his umbrella.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.991
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.492
Here you go... "Dad."

08:46.492 --> 08:48.494
(all chuckling)

08:49.929 --> 08:51.430
Well, I don't blame him for that.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.499
Leland's more
like him than I am.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.001
Really?
You really think so?

08:55.001 --> 08:57.003
Oh, come on, how can
you not see it?

08:57.003 --> 09:00.306
They're like three
fancy peas in a pod.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.607
Well, I did notice
that they have

09:01.607 --> 09:03.109
the same taste
in art and music,

09:03.109 --> 09:05.611
and they even have
some of the same mannerisms.

09:05.611 --> 09:06.445
Yeah.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.415
And Leland and Niles
are both allergic

09:09.415 --> 09:11.918
to rosehips
and Jerusalem artichokes.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.286
Weird, huh?

09:13.753 --> 09:15.321
When Leland was talking
to me last night

09:15.821 --> 09:17.323
about how close
he and Hester were,

09:17.323 --> 09:19.225
I started thinking
what you're thinking.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.431
And what am I thinking?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.733
Nothing.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.936
What are you saying?
You think he's their father?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.637
No, I wasn't saying that

09:31.904 --> 09:34.473
Well, lots of people like art and sherry and-and...

09:34.473 --> 09:35.474
French stuff.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.243
It doesn't mean they're related.

09:37.476 --> 09:41.447
By your logic, everyone on the
cooking channel is their father.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.150
Okay.
Okay

09:45.952 --> 09:47.954
Ugh! what the hell is this?

09:47.954 --> 09:48.955
I don't know.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.957
It was there
when I sat down.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.960
Ew!

09:56.929 --> 09:59.465
Leland, your autobiography is wonderful.

09:59.966 --> 10:00.967
Thank you.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.969
Let us hope that
the publishing houses
feel similarly.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.403
Ah. Have you shown it to Frasier?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.339
No, I haven't.
How's he feeling, by the way?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.340
Let's go see.
Right.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.841
(cell phone rings)

10:08.841 --> 10:10.176
Yeah, bring the
manuscript; he'd love to see it.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.078
Hello.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.012
Oh, hello, darling.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.447
Go ahead, I'll be right there.

10:14.847 --> 10:18.684
Okay, so Delilah's out.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.653
No, no, that's fine,
that's fine.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.188
What are your ideas?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.189
Taylor, uh-huh.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.691
Fletcher.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.693
Cooper.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.695
Tanner.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.697
Where are you getting these,

10:31.697 --> 10:34.700
The Big Book
of Medieval Professions?

10:35.101 --> 10:38.004
Frasier, how you doing?

10:38.270 --> 10:40.339
Oh, I'm afraid my stomach is still churning.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.608
I-I'm not going to be able to make dinner.

10:42.808 --> 10:43.876
Oh, I understand.

10:43.876 --> 10:44.877
Well, I'll leave you to rest

10:44.877 --> 10:46.879
Perhaps though, later,
if you're feeling better

10:46.879 --> 10:47.880
I can get your opinion

10:47.880 --> 10:49.715
on a short section
of my autobiography.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.052
Well, when I can't give
an opinion, you may as well

10:53.052 --> 10:55.488
call the coroner, tag my toe,
I'm dead.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.290
(laughing)

10:58.290 --> 11:00.693
No, that's a kind of car

11:03.195 --> 11:04.196
Hey, Niles.
Hey.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.131
What's going on?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.034
Oh, we were going to go out
to dinner with Leland,

11:08.034 --> 11:10.036
but Frasier's
not feeling well.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.937
Oh, well, maybe
I'll go check on him.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.907
Now it just sounds like you're reading from the spice rack.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.579
"I realized the Sherpa
had become my guide

11:20.579 --> 11:22.581
in more ways than one."

11:22.581 --> 11:24.083
Oh, that was wonderful.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.985
Read me another.

11:26.318 --> 11:27.820
Oh, no,
you go to sleep now.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.989
Oh, Dad.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.257
Hey, Fras. Just, uh,

11:31.257 --> 11:33.759
was wondering
how you were feeling.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.761
Oh, well,
not so good actually.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.265
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to skip dinner.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.267
Why don't you go
in my place?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.635
Sure, if you
want me to.
All right.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.470
You know, the two of you
should get going

11:44.470 --> 11:45.838
or you'll miss the reservation

11:46.105 --> 11:47.440
Right. Well, get well, son.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.308
We'll be wishing you
a speedy recovery. Mm?

11:49.775 --> 11:50.643
Oh, thank you.

11:51.944 --> 11:52.945
Oh, Fras, you want me

11:53.479 --> 11:55.981
to bring you something back
from the restaurant?

11:55.981 --> 11:58.384
Maybe some Jell-O
to soothe your tummy?

11:58.751 --> 12:00.286
Thanks, Dad,
it's all taken care of.

12:00.286 --> 12:03.222
Leland is going to bring me
some consomm￩ and sorbet.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.624
Oh.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.960
Okay.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.361
Well, Niles, it looks like

12:09.361 --> 12:12.298
your dad is going to take Frasier's place at dinner.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.366
Oh, excellent.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.868
Oh!

12:15.868 --> 12:16.769
What's the matter?

12:17.136 --> 12:18.471
My leg's asleep.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.638
Ooh, move your foot around.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.640
No, no, it's the whole leg.
I'll just wait it out.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.642
But the movement will get the blood flowing.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.145
Go ahead, give it a try.
No, can't put
weight on it.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.480
Sure you can. Give it a try.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.315
Come on, one step
at a time, come on

12:29.315 --> 12:31.817
There you go. That a boy

12:31.817 --> 12:34.320
That a boy. Keep going

12:34.320 --> 12:35.654
There you are, good.

12:41.627 --> 12:43.662
Hey, Roz.
Hey, Martin.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.664
If you're looking for
Frasier, he just left.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.666
Well, thanks, but actually,
I was looking for you.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.635
I could use
a little advice.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.504
From me? Really?

12:51.837 --> 12:53.906
Well, if it stinks,
I can always ignore it.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.908
Okay, that's a plan. Come on in.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.243
I'm just finishing up.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.113
What do you need?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.516
Uh, it's the Leland thing.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.919
I mean, even though
I know it's not possible

13:07.419 --> 13:09.922
that he's Frasier
and Niles' father,

13:09.922 --> 13:13.192
I guess what's bugging me
is, technically, it is possible.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.928
Well, sure,
it's possible,
technically.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.830
Martin, do you really think

13:18.330 --> 13:21.133
your wife would have
ever cheated on you?

13:23.969 --> 13:24.970
She did.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.872
She said it happened once.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.308
Oh, my God.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.709
With Leland?

13:31.043 --> 13:33.045
No. With someone else.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.982
I think that you're
driving yourself crazy
for nothing here.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.485
Of course Frasier and
Niles are your sons.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.320
You're exactly
like them.

13:41.587 --> 13:42.621
"Like"? How?

13:42.988 --> 13:45.457
A strong sense of ethics.

13:45.457 --> 13:49.895
Yeah. We are ethical.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.163
What else?

13:51.163 --> 13:53.399
The way they spin out
of control.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.835
Hmm. That's true.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.770
They got that from me.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.205
Their stubbornness.
I'm not stubborn.

13:59.705 --> 14:00.206
Their defensiveness.

14:00.706 --> 14:01.707
What's that
supposed to mean?

14:01.707 --> 14:03.209
The way they completely
dismiss anyone

14:03.209 --> 14:04.210
who doesn't share
their opinion.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.179
Oh, now you're just
being dumb.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.216
Hey, what is the
worst-case scenario?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.718
If you found out you
weren't their father,

14:12.718 --> 14:14.220
would you love
them any less?

14:14.220 --> 14:15.988
No, no.

14:15.988 --> 14:20.759
Well, yeah, a little, maybe,
at first, but no.

14:20.759 --> 14:24.563
I'd feel the same about them as I hope they would about me.

14:24.563 --> 14:28.234
Which they would,
and you know that.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.668
Yeah.

14:29.668 --> 14:32.671
I mean, you'd still love Alice if you'd found out

14:32.671 --> 14:35.507
you'd gotten the wrong baby at the hospital.

14:35.507 --> 14:36.375
Sure.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.877
(both chuckle)

14:37.877 --> 14:40.379
And as a cop,
I've seen that happen

14:40.379 --> 14:41.881
more often than
you'd think.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.382
Especially at
Seattle General.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.384
I had Alice
at Seattle General.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.853
Oh. Sorry.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.289
But the point was that
you'd love her just the same

14:50.289 --> 14:52.191
so who cares
who her real mother is.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.059
I'm her real mother!

14:54.059 --> 14:55.561
Okay, geez.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.997
How about Desmond?

14:57.997 --> 14:59.031
Desmond Crane.

14:59.031 --> 15:02.067
Desmond Crane, you are
hereby sentenced to...

15:02.067 --> 15:04.570
No, I don't like it.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.971
What about Jack?

15:06.305 --> 15:08.374
Afraid not.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.376
The first name ends
with the same sound

15:10.376 --> 15:11.377
that begins the last name.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.879
So you either end up
running them together

15:13.879 --> 15:16.382
Jack Crane, or you face
the dreaded glottal stop.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.818
Jack Crane. Jack Crane.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.722
It's unpleasant
for the throat.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.225
This conversation's
unpleasant for the throat.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.726
Well, I know, I know.

15:27.726 --> 15:31.730
Okay. Oh... why don't we use
the name of that nice nurse

15:31.730 --> 15:33.165
from when I was
in the hospital?

15:33.532 --> 15:36.602
Fong or Deshondra?

15:39.071 --> 15:40.039
Fong.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.442
Wait. Let's not
drive ourselves
crazy about this.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.477
It's a temporary name
for a hypothetical child.

15:45.477 --> 15:48.447
Yes, but once you give something
a name, it makes it more real,

15:48.447 --> 15:50.916
and then that name will always
have a sort of priority.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.185
I don't care
how often you say

15:53.185 --> 15:55.454
"elevator" or "apartment"
or "crossing guard,"

15:55.454 --> 15:57.957
to me they'll always be
"lifts" and "flats"

15:57.957 --> 15:59.458
and "lollipop men."

15:59.458 --> 16:02.461
Well, then, tell you what,
you pick a name

16:02.461 --> 16:04.897
and I'll accept it
unconditionally.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.132
Milton.

16:07.132 --> 16:11.303
Milton. Great poet
and a great name.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.304
Great.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.305
Can we go to bed now?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.807
Yes.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.312
Hey, didn't you have

16:20.312 --> 16:22.815
a soccer hooligan
boyfriend named Milton?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.817
Yeah, that's where
I got it.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.602
Me and my boys.

17:17.102 --> 17:20.472
My boys and me, yeah.
We're wonderful

17:20.472 --> 17:22.741
and we're musical.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.108
Martin, I can't tell you

17:24.108 --> 17:25.511
what a wonderful job
you've done with them.

17:25.810 --> 17:26.878
Oh, it's wasn't a job.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.381
It was a biological
pleasure.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.383
And don't forget,
I had Hester.

17:31.817 --> 17:32.885
(phone rings)
Oh, excuse me.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.386
You were lucky.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.387
She was a splendid woman

17:35.387 --> 17:36.889
and a remarkable
research partner.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.224
And an even better
life partner.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.560
Well, I wouldn't know
about that.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.529
Damn straight you wouldn't

17:43.896 --> 17:46.331
Leland, your cab is waiting.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.667
Oh, so soon?

17:49.034 --> 17:53.038
Well, I can't thank you enough for all your courtesies.

17:53.038 --> 17:55.407
Bless you.
If you are ever in Paris,

17:55.407 --> 17:58.277
you must allow me
to repay your many kindnesses.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.645
Oh, thank you
so much.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.647
I'm so proud of the way
you boys have turned out.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.148
Leland, let me
walk you out.

18:03.148 --> 18:04.583
Thank you.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.617
NILES:
Bon voyage.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.431
Leland, there's a question
I need to ask you.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.233
Oh, yes, of course.
Anything.

18:21.233 --> 18:25.571
I'm a little uncomfortable even bringing it up,

18:25.571 --> 18:27.573
but I don't think I could let you leave the country

18:28.073 --> 18:29.475
without knowing the answer.

18:29.475 --> 18:36.748
I know that you and my wife
spent a lot of time together,

18:37.082 --> 18:38.617
that you were close.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.521
I loved her very much.

18:42.521 --> 18:47.826
And I guess my question is,
how much?

18:47.826 --> 18:52.264
Enough to...

18:52.764 --> 18:55.067
trust her with the fact
that I'm gay.

18:55.067 --> 18:59.271
Oh!

18:59.271 --> 19:02.174
40 years ago,
people weren't as accepting

19:02.174 --> 19:03.675
as they are nowadays,

19:03.675 --> 19:06.979
