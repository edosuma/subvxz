00:00.078 --> 00:01.487
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:01.488 --> 00:03.737
- How're you feeling about your pitch?
- I think it's great.

00:03.738 --> 00:04.868
A few of the women and I are

00:04.892 --> 00:06.257
putting together a spreadsheet

00:06.282 --> 00:07.737
that proves that
there's a gender pay gap.

00:07.738 --> 00:09.920
Did you really think a
password would keep me out?

00:09.945 --> 00:11.104
This is Viv.

00:11.129 --> 00:12.338
I think Viv is homeless.

00:12.363 --> 00:14.964
You don't know what the story is
with her dad, if there even is one.

00:14.988 --> 00:16.581
- You close with your brother?
- I wanna be.

00:16.605 --> 00:17.729
But he doesn't.

00:17.737 --> 00:19.236
And I'm working on forgiving you, too.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.964
- She's the only mother we got!
- I am not sorry!

00:21.989 --> 00:23.003
Dom?

00:23.028 --> 00:25.186
- When're you just gonna come out to your parents?
- Never.

00:25.187 --> 00:28.633
- I'm over Sumi.
- We are excited to get married.

00:28.658 --> 00:31.106
- She's not over you.
- You gonna tell me about Callie?

00:31.107 --> 00:32.747
Helping you with your piece last night?

00:32.773 --> 00:34.013
Did you hook up with her?

00:34.038 --> 00:35.254
So, I'm your boyfriend.

00:35.279 --> 00:36.736
They dropped the charges?

00:36.737 --> 00:38.236
He took a swing at a police officer.

00:38.237 --> 00:40.686
You were a shitty husband,
and a shitty father!

00:40.687 --> 00:42.976
I wish I was the one
who died that day, not Jacob.

00:48.357 --> 00:50.856
I want to thank everybody for comin' out

00:50.857 --> 00:53.154
to support Jamal and my family

00:53.977 --> 00:55.316
It is s my great honor

00:55.317 --> 00:56.899
to introduce one of the co-founders

00:56.924 --> 00:58.276
of Black Lives Matter...

00:58.277 --> 01:00.566
...Patrisse Cullors.

01:08.730 --> 01:11.396
Good morning, and
thank you for having me

01:11.397 --> 01:13.934
on such a tragic occasion.

01:13.959 --> 01:17.552
I want to send my deepest
condolences to Jamal's family,

01:18.333 --> 01:20.316
friends, and community.

01:20.317 --> 01:23.566
Jamal joins a running
list of black people killed

01:23.567 --> 01:24.776
by law enforcement.

01:24.777 --> 01:28.344
We are tired of burying our children.

01:28.369 --> 01:30.566
- "Forced out" why?
- There was an I.A. investigation

01:30.567 --> 01:32.186
goin' on about some comments

01:32.187 --> 01:33.643
he allegedly made to officers.

01:33.668 --> 01:36.356
One of which was that it's
cheaper for the department

01:36.357 --> 01:38.305
to let victims of police shootings die.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.066
- That's disgusting.
- There's more.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.776
Apparently, one of the officers present

01:41.777 --> 01:44.242
when Chief Kelley made the
comment, was one of the defendants

01:44.267 --> 01:46.857
in your case... Officer Griffin.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.155
Alicia Opal and I started

01:50.180 --> 01:52.194
Black Lives Matter five years ago

01:52.219 --> 01:54.141
- because we believe this country
- _

01:54.166 --> 01:56.106
- desperately needed to transform.
- _

01:56.107 --> 01:59.026
- Black Lives Matter!
- _

01:59.027 --> 02:01.575
Black Lives Matter!

02:01.600 --> 02:03.450
Jamal's life mattered!

02:03.475 --> 02:08.975
- Jamal's life mattered!
- Jamal's life mattered!

02:10.308 --> 02:12.896
Your mother has
suffered a brain aneurysm.

02:12.897 --> 02:16.026
The rupture caused severe
bleeding and stroke.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.095
There's no brain activity,

02:18.939 --> 02:21.525
and if we were to remove
life support now...

02:21.550 --> 02:23.447
she wouldn't be able
to breathe on her own.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.277
I don't believe that she's brain dead.

02:28.288 --> 02:30.413
It's just cheaper for you
to just let her die.

02:30.749 --> 02:32.106
A black woman with no money.

02:35.027 --> 02:36.496
They don't care about her life.

02:37.453 --> 02:39.082
I'm not pullin' the plug.

02:39.317 --> 02:41.019
I'm not lettin' them do that to her.

Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!

03:28.438 --> 03:29.618
What is this?

03:29.643 --> 03:30.954
It's the salary information

03:31.477 --> 03:33.146
for all the men who work at Speckulate.

03:33.655 --> 03:35.405
Why are you giving this to me?

03:39.084 --> 03:42.584
- Am I interrupting anything?
- Nope, we are done.

03:45.722 --> 03:46.824
Everything okay?

03:47.097 --> 03:48.167
Yeah, fine.

03:48.527 --> 03:49.606
So, I've been, uh,

03:49.631 --> 03:51.857
thinking a lot about your Activism app.

03:51.882 --> 03:54.841
And I want to get started right
away, so I'm gonna give you

03:54.866 --> 03:57.285
a team of two engineers, a designer

03:57.317 --> 03:58.793
and an assistant, you can...

03:59.397 --> 04:00.816
choose whomever you want.

04:03.713 --> 04:04.776
That's not enough people.

04:04.777 --> 04:05.976
If you want more...

04:05.977 --> 04:07.612
No! That's amazing.

04:08.713 --> 04:11.587
Well... your... idea is amazing.

04:14.527 --> 04:16.680
- Uh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.228 --> 04:19.276
I should... get to work.

04:30.319 --> 04:32.106
Hey, all of this goes

04:32.107 --> 04:34.214
to the roof, but you have
to take the stairs. I'll help.

04:34.238 --> 04:36.846
Dennis, I'm going to keep
calling until you call me back.

04:36.871 --> 04:39.674
- I got it.
- And do not text me, I need to hear your voice!

04:39.699 --> 04:41.646
- Thanks! Nothing yet?
- No.

04:41.647 --> 04:44.050
I've called every jail and hospital.

04:44.527 --> 04:45.856
He's not in any of them.

04:45.881 --> 04:47.535
He's probably just on a banging bender

04:47.560 --> 04:50.430
with some 20-year-old
hot yoga teacher, right?

04:51.225 --> 04:53.105
- Hey, how was the protest?
- Good.

04:54.187 --> 04:55.976
Great seeing you there, by the way.

04:57.237 --> 04:58.896
Had a nail appointment.

04:58.897 --> 05:00.066
Dude...

05:00.067 --> 05:01.399
Did you see Malika?

05:01.424 --> 05:03.932
No, I didn't see her, but
there was a huge turnout.

05:04.357 --> 05:05.855
- Okay.
- God, I just don't understand why

05:05.879 --> 05:07.698
Dennis is putting us
all through this shit!

05:08.143 --> 05:09.174
Uh, Davia?

05:10.971 --> 05:12.106
I've heard much worse.

05:12.107 --> 05:13.818
Viv, what're you doing here?

05:14.229 --> 05:15.606
My dad's working late again.

05:15.607 --> 05:16.748
Can I hang here with you?

05:17.693 --> 05:18.977
Sure. Come on.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.857
Alice? I need you!

05:28.211 --> 05:29.258
How do I look?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.738
I think I'm still in love with you...

05:37.144 --> 05:39.054
Hey, I was looking for you.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.653
You look... beautiful.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.566
Alice...

05:48.567 --> 05:51.052
- I-I...
- Hey! Um...

05:51.528 --> 05:53.122
people have questions.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.564
I don't know anything, so...

05:56.493 --> 05:59.101
- So where's this wedding happening?
- Oh, everything's upstairs.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.376
On the roof, just go straight

06:00.401 --> 06:01.780
and the stairs are to your right.

06:01.805 --> 06:03.126
Who's getting married?

06:03.442 --> 06:04.952
Mom, Dad!

06:04.977 --> 06:07.418
Uh, what're you doing here...

06:07.443 --> 06:10.236
- ...today?
- We have an engagement present for Sumi.

06:10.261 --> 06:11.276
Sumi?

06:11.277 --> 06:13.760
- We were in the neighborhood.
- You live in Orange County.

06:13.785 --> 06:16.066
Every time we want to
come see where you live

06:16.067 --> 06:17.463
you make excuses,

06:17.870 --> 06:21.316
_

06:21.737 --> 06:23.128
Uh, look! Look!

06:23.698 --> 06:26.816
- What's there?
- Oh, I thought I saw a bat.

06:26.817 --> 06:28.580
- A bat?!
- You have bats?

06:28.605 --> 06:32.012
Well, Sumi's out of town, yeah,
you know, she's on vacation.

06:32.037 --> 06:33.908
So I'll make sure she gets this.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.355
So, what is this place?

06:37.380 --> 06:40.200
Well, we all have our own
apartments but we share

06:40.225 --> 06:41.895
a bathroom and a kitchen.

06:42.105 --> 06:43.186
Greetings.

06:43.187 --> 06:45.736
Boys and girls shower together?

06:45.761 --> 06:48.103
Well, not, like, together.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.936
Oh, hey.

06:52.937 --> 06:54.566
This is Jo...

06:54.567 --> 06:56.066
anna.

06:56.251 --> 06:57.516
She, um,

06:57.541 --> 06:58.646
is...

06:58.994 --> 07:01.026
She's someone who lives here.

07:01.027 --> 07:02.580
- Yes.
- Oh, hello.

07:02.605 --> 07:05.066
- Uh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.564
You know what? I'm kinda busy,

07:06.589 --> 07:09.458
so, um, I'll make sure Sumi
gets this, and you two can just,

07:09.937 --> 07:11.533
- you know...
- Surprise!

07:11.558 --> 07:13.066
You're back!

07:13.067 --> 07:16.027
- So soon. How was your trip?
- What?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.526
Oh! Oh, great!

07:19.550 --> 07:21.236
_

07:21.237 --> 07:22.526
- San Francisco.
- San Diego.

07:22.527 --> 07:24.276
I knew it was San "Something."

07:24.277 --> 07:26.009
Those two get so mixed up.

07:26.298 --> 07:27.943
I have something for the bride.

07:29.146 --> 07:30.458
There she is!

07:30.483 --> 07:32.153
The bride, Meera.

07:33.054 --> 07:35.035
And Gael, the groom.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.461
Yes, ah, lovebirds, aren't
they cute, Mom and Dad?

07:37.486 --> 07:38.686
- Mm-hmm.
- Very nice.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.082
_

07:40.107 --> 07:43.026
- Congratulations.
- They're so in love!

07:44.057 --> 07:47.357
Yes... oh, yes, we are so in love.

07:49.067 --> 07:51.397
Mm. Mmm.

07:58.726 --> 08:00.524
We have to create it so we can feel

08:00.548 --> 08:02.077
proud of this country.

08:02.817 --> 08:07.106
So we can feel proud of
raising our children here,

08:07.691 --> 08:11.449
in this place that's
supposed to be free.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.936
You don't have to stay.

08:18.249 --> 08:21.958
I know it's hard to accept, but...

08:25.357 --> 08:26.717
Mom's gone.

08:29.326 --> 08:30.779
You'd be happy if she was dead.

08:31.826 --> 08:32.977
That's not true.

08:37.106 --> 08:38.417
I have somewhere I have to be.

08:38.442 --> 08:39.614
I'm sorry.

08:41.645 --> 08:42.686
But I'll be back?

08:58.544 --> 09:00.392
How do I know that you
aren't setting me up?

09:03.397 --> 09:04.743
When I took this job,

09:05.243 --> 09:07.399
they told me they wanted
to change the culture here.

09:08.246 --> 09:10.503
But, that was all B.S.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.682
The same B.S. I sold you on.

09:15.527 --> 09:17.907
I'd quit, but I'm a single
mom and I need the paycheck.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.857
I gave you that info to you because...

09:22.817 --> 09:25.056
the only way to force change around here

09:25.552 --> 09:27.340
is to publicly shame them.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.254
Please, no one can ever
know I gave that to you,

09:31.859 --> 09:34.543
or else I will never
work anywhere again.

09:37.027 --> 09:39.825
All rise for the
Honorable Judge Curtis Wilson.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.396
- Still can't believe he gave her your case.
- Thanks.

09:51.897 --> 09:52.936
Why not me?

09:53.147 --> 09:54.225
This totally sucks.

09:54.772 --> 09:55.816
You may be seated.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.236
That's hearsay.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.396
You can't prove Chief Kelley said that.

10:07.397 --> 10:08.816
And since he just passed away,

10:08.817 --> 10:10.356
you can't question him about it either.

10:10.357 --> 10:11.809
But you can prove

10:11.834 --> 10:13.154
Officer Griffin said he heard it.

10:13.996 --> 10:15.426
If I.A. questioned about it,

10:15.930 --> 10:17.290
it would be in his personnel file.

10:17.356 --> 10:19.236
Maybe that's why Wilson
wouldn't let us read it.

10:19.465 --> 10:22.653
If Griffin admitted to
being told that, by his boss?

10:23.098 --> 10:24.258
It goes straight to the failure

10:24.282 --> 10:25.867
to provide critical care complaint.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.316
But Wilson's already ruled
his personnel files stay out.

10:28.317 --> 10:29.384
It's not right!

10:29.937 --> 10:30.937
If it's in there,

10:31.204 --> 10:32.347
how could Wilson do that?

10:33.324 --> 10:35.764
Unless, that's how he got the
charges against his son dropped.

10:36.781 --> 10:37.983
Good afternoon.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.289
If everyone is ready, we'll
begin with opening statements.

10:49.187 --> 10:51.625
Jamal Thompson was shot

10:52.008 --> 10:53.646
seven times in the back,

10:53.851 --> 10:56.718
by Officer Griffin and Officer Turani.

10:57.677 --> 11:00.966
Merely because of the color of his skin.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.976
Because...

11:02.977 --> 11:04.897
some police are biased

11:05.913 --> 11:08.066
against men and women of color.

11:08.514 --> 11:09.526
Because...

11:09.527 --> 11:10.616
they could.

11:10.641 --> 11:12.845
Because there are police officers

11:12.870 --> 11:15.189
getting away with excessive use of force

11:15.214 --> 11:18.526
- every day in this country.
- Objection. Inflammatory.

11:18.527 --> 11:19.606
Sustained.

11:23.542 --> 11:24.698
Jamal Thompson...

11:25.011 --> 11:26.519
was arrested at 18

11:26.739 --> 11:27.778
for assault and battery.

11:27.803 --> 11:29.472
He was jumped by gang members.

11:29.497 --> 11:32.015
Officers will testify
that he was in a gang.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.132
Objection! Facts not in evidence.

11:34.157 --> 11:35.187
I'll allow it.

11:35.641 --> 11:38.038
Jamal was not in a gang.

11:38.063 --> 11:39.945
And not every young black man

11:40.156 --> 11:42.264
- is a gang member.
- Jamal matched

11:42.289 --> 11:43.616
the witness description

11:43.641 --> 11:47.236
of a 5'10" African-American
male wearing a red shirt

11:47.261 --> 11:48.646
who was breaking into cars.

11:48.647 --> 11:50.526
Not every witness reported the suspect

11:50.527 --> 11:52.212
to be wearing a red shirt.

11:52.237 --> 11:53.736
Why did he run if he was innocent?

11:53.737 --> 11:54.761
He was scared.

11:54.786 --> 11:56.867
He ran because he was guilty

11:56.892 --> 11:58.147
and afraid of getting caught.

11:58.148 --> 11:59.710
He was running away from them

11:59.735 --> 12:02.026
- when they shot him in the back.
- He turned...

12:02.027 --> 12:03.976
and lunged at them.
They thought he was armed.

12:03.977 --> 12:05.709
They were in fear for their lives.

12:05.734 --> 12:07.584
Does this look like a gun to you?

12:07.609 --> 12:08.976
Objection. Testifying.

12:08.977 --> 12:09.977
Sustained.

12:12.407 --> 12:13.688
And after they shot him,

12:15.063 --> 12:16.436
they let him lay there

12:16.907 --> 12:18.086
for 20 minutes,

12:18.687 --> 12:21.236
bleeding to death.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.912
Governor just signed
a bill granting access

12:55.937 --> 12:57.936
to the investigatory
records on officer conduct.

12:57.937 --> 12:59.913
That includes personnel files.

12:59.938 --> 13:01.381
There will still be exceptions,

13:01.406 --> 13:02.981
and until it takes effect in January,

13:03.006 --> 13:04.436
I'm bound by current law.

13:04.437 --> 13:06.476
Aren't you giving Jamal's
family grounds to appeal?

13:06.477 --> 13:08.792
No. Knowing what's in here,

13:08.817 --> 13:10.386
I'm confident that

13:10.411 --> 13:13.442
my ruling to keep Officer Griffin's
personnel records redacted

13:13.879 --> 13:15.262
will stand...

13:15.287 --> 13:16.527
even under the new law.

13:46.747 --> 13:50.912
_

13:50.937 --> 13:52.378
Thanks for letting me take a shower.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.156
Sure.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.575
It's good to have it done so

13:55.600 --> 13:58.026
when I get home, I won't
go to bed with wet hair.

13:58.434 --> 13:59.629
Where is "home"?

14:00.278 --> 14:01.316
Where do you live?

14:01.732 --> 14:02.976
Atwater Village.

14:02.977 --> 14:03.977
We have a house.

14:04.490 --> 14:05.693
So it's just you and your dad?

14:05.718 --> 14:06.786
Yeah...

14:06.811 --> 14:07.899
my mom died...

14:08.027 --> 14:09.106
a while ago.

14:09.623 --> 14:10.952
I'm really sorry to hear that.

14:11.357 --> 14:12.396
So...

14:12.397 --> 14:13.482
where's your boyfriend?

14:13.849 --> 14:14.937
Jeff?

14:16.357 --> 14:17.976
Ah, well, he doesn't live out here.

14:17.977 --> 14:19.526
He's back home in Wisconsin.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.936
- Are you guys serious?
- We are.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.896
But we have some pretty
big obstacles to overcome.

14:25.897 --> 14:28.375
Oh! My dad's here.

14:28.937 --> 14:30.856
Thanks for letting me hang out again.

14:30.857 --> 14:32.386
Why don't you ask your dad to come up?

14:33.187 --> 14:34.327
I'd like to meet him.

14:36.567 --> 14:39.566
I mean, the point is to change
the culture at Speckulate.

14:39.567 --> 14:42.736
Now that I have Evan's ear,
maybe I can have an impact on him.

14:42.737 --> 14:44.476
Maybe he didn't even
know about the pay gap.

14:44.477 --> 14:46.313
Maybe if I just talk to him about it,

14:46.338 --> 14:47.338
he'll fix it.

14:47.363 --> 14:49.894
And I'm getting to create
a social activism app.

14:50.218 --> 14:51.965
And I'm gonna hire Malika to consult.

14:52.402 --> 14:54.292
That could be a real change
in the world, where

14:54.754 --> 14:58.146
publishing the salary info could
just not have any effect at all.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.096
And it could just end
up getting me fired.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.976
What do you think I should do?

15:03.936 --> 15:05.184
Well...

15:08.147 --> 15:10.798
I think you can convince
yourself of almost anything.

15:11.756 --> 15:13.681
But your gut will always
tell you what's right.

15:15.298 --> 15:16.986
My gut tells me

15:17.369 --> 15:18.965
that my app will have
a more positive effect

15:18.989 --> 15:20.476
on changing the culture at Speckulate

15:20.477 --> 15:22.686
more than publishing the
salary information will.

15:22.687 --> 15:23.786
Well, there you go.

15:24.317 --> 15:26.397
Hey, this came for you earlier.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.027
So lucky I have you to talk to.

15:31.737 --> 15:33.177
How was your first day of the trial?

15:33.311 --> 15:34.857
Not sure.

15:39.187 --> 15:40.777
What's that?

15:42.027 --> 15:43.937
Uh, just a work thing.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.524
I am grateful to you for
taking care of my daughter.

15:50.376 --> 15:54.911
I work two jobs and they ask
me to stay late sometimes.

15:55.737 --> 15:58.477
I-I understand, I just
wanted to meet you.

15:59.780 --> 16:02.334
Uh, Viv says you have a home in Atwater?

16:03.436 --> 16:06.491
Is there any way she could take
the school bus after school?

16:06.999 --> 16:08.873
She seems mature
enough to be home alone.

16:11.477 --> 16:14.176
We, uh, did have a home.

16:14.777 --> 16:15.846
But...

16:16.647 --> 16:18.734
my wife was very sick

16:18.759 --> 16:20.921
and we lose our house.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.890
Where do you live now?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.652
I, um... saving

16:26.677 --> 16:28.794
for a deposit on an apartment.

16:29.966 --> 16:31.153
I hope to have enough soon.

16:31.716 --> 16:36.606
We're, uh-uh staying in shelters
and-and with friends when we can...

16:37.578 --> 16:38.736
Please...

16:39.024 --> 16:40.912
if you won't... call anyone.

16:41.929 --> 16:44.593
It is very hard as a single parent.

16:45.343 --> 16:46.648
Having to work so much.

16:49.155 --> 16:51.356
You know why I started with the drugs.

16:51.357 --> 16:54.186
I was working two full-time jobs.

17:03.777 --> 17:05.396
I don't want to lose my daughter.

17:07.715 --> 17:09.146
She won't tell anyone.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.976
She's cool.

17:16.896 --> 17:18.395
You're her favorite teacher.

17:19.598 --> 17:23.027
She says if not for you, she
wouldn't want to go to school.

17:24.339 --> 17:26.025
That learning would be boring.

17:26.050 --> 17:27.230
But you make it fun.

17:28.230 --> 17:29.276
Well...

17:29.777 --> 17:31.856
she's my favorite student.

17:32.332 --> 17:33.476
Don't tell anyone.

17:41.232 --> 17:42.888
I was homeless for a while.

17:43.722 --> 17:44.897
There's no shame in it.

17:49.541 --> 17:50.733
It's all here.

17:52.260 --> 17:54.896
Griffin told Internal
Affairs that he was there

17:54.897 --> 17:56.481
when Chief Kelley said that it's cheaper

17:56.505 --> 17:58.936
for the department to let
victims of police shootings die.

17:58.937 --> 18:01.538
You can't leak those
files to Jamal's attorneys.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.736
If they had these records,
they might win their case.

18:04.737 --> 18:07.186
Or at the very least, the
failure to provide critical care.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.356
It's unethical.

18:08.953 --> 18:10.146
No one would have to know.

18:10.147 --> 18:11.296
You'd know.

18:13.097 --> 18:16.167
Whoever leaked those
files to you will know.

18:16.977 --> 18:18.146
I wonder who it was.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.778
Maybe the investigator's

18:20.803 --> 18:23.107
- source in the department?
- Exactly!

18:23.629 --> 18:25.418
You don't know who they came from.

18:25.607 --> 18:27.026
Or if they can be trusted.

18:27.779 --> 18:28.936
If they get caught,

18:29.115 --> 18:30.186
will they talk?

18:30.211 --> 18:31.294
'Cause if that happens,

18:31.319 --> 18:32.832
your career will be over.

18:33.309 --> 18:34.736
You'll never be able to practice law.

18:34.737 --> 18:36.489
You might even face criminal charges.

18:36.514 --> 18:40.129
What's unethical is that I.A.
never made the investigation public

18:40.154 --> 18:42.615
and Wilson chose to keep
these files redacted.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.787
Why would he do that

18:43.812 --> 18:45.213
if he wasn't protecting the police?

18:45.490 --> 18:47.887
You don't know if he
made some deal to get

18:47.912 --> 18:49.281
his son's charges dropped.

18:49.647 --> 18:50.736
You could be wrong.

18:50.737 --> 18:53.059
And you'd be betraying
Wilson, your clerkship,

18:53.084 --> 18:55.208
and the oath you promised to uphold.

18:55.233 --> 18:56.898
What about betraying Jamal's family...

18:57.737 --> 19:00.031
and Malika, and the
justice they deserve?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.566
You're up late.

19:12.011 --> 19:13.286
Just working.

19:13.687 --> 19:14.989
What's your excuse?

19:15.721 --> 19:16.863
Couldn't sleep.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.715
Was gonna go for a walk.

19:22.670 --> 19:23.817
'Night.

19:28.305 --> 19:29.654
I broke it off with Bryan.

19:39.977 --> 19:41.526
Thank you.

19:41.527 --> 19:42.936
Yeah, it was fun.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.067
Good night.

19:53.605 --> 19:55.935
Part of the reason I... broke it off...

19:57.889 --> 19:58.985
was you.

20:00.852 --> 20:03.766
I haven't felt this way
about anybody in a long time.

20:06.758 --> 20:08.099
I should have fought for you.

20:10.147 --> 20:11.443
I know you're seeing Jamie.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.375
But if you have any doubts,
that he's the guy for you...

20:20.399 --> 20:22.188
I just wanted you to know where I stand.

20:47.897 --> 20:49.396
I mean, activism?

20:49.397 --> 20:50.917
It's a little on the nose, right?

20:51.397 --> 20:54.356
- Evan couldn't care less about social issues.
- Right.

20:54.357 --> 20:56.646
You remember the other pretty
engineer girl? What was her name?

20:56.647 --> 20:59.566
- Yeah, it was something exotic, like Armen...
- Alina?

20:59.567 --> 21:00.976
With an A...

21:00.977 --> 21:02.476
- Ar... Amanda!
- Amanda, right.

21:02.477 --> 21:04.807
Evan took an "interest"
in her and then boom!

21:04.832 --> 21:07.251
- Yeah, her app was toast.
- And so was she.

21:10.527 --> 21:12.066
You may be seated.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.483
Your Honor, we'd like
to call our forensic witnesses.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.760
Jamal was running away when Officers

21:25.785 --> 21:27.212
Griffin and Turani opened fire,

21:27.237 --> 21:28.686
hitting him seven times

21:28.687 --> 21:30.686
in the upper left shoulder and torso.

21:30.687 --> 21:32.526
He stopped suddenly, turned,

21:32.527 --> 21:33.766
and lunged at them.

21:33.797 --> 21:35.981
Fearing for their lives,
they fired their weapons,

21:36.006 --> 21:38.646
striking him in the right
thigh and shoulder.

21:38.647 --> 21:40.343
The force of those
seven bullets to the back

21:40.367 --> 21:42.984
spun Jamal around,
facing toward the officer

21:43.009 --> 21:44.234
where the last two bullets

21:44.259 --> 21:46.109
hit him in the right thigh and shoulder.

21:46.134 --> 21:48.054
The force of the bullets
to the right thigh

21:48.079 --> 21:51.569
and shoulder spun him around,
facing away from the officers,

21:51.594 --> 21:53.546
causing the remaining seven bullets

21:53.571 --> 21:57.237
to strike him in the left,
rear shoulder and torso.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.935
Based on the autopsy and
the fact that the bullets

22:01.960 --> 22:03.543
didn't lacerate any major organs...

22:03.568 --> 22:04.755
The aorta was severed...

22:04.780 --> 22:07.066
- With immediate critical care...
- No matter how fast

22:07.091 --> 22:08.522
the EMTs could have begun working...

22:08.546 --> 22:10.333
I believe Jamal had a 50%

22:10.358 --> 22:11.970
or better chance of survival.

22:11.995 --> 22:14.026
I believe Mr. Thompson's
wounds were fatal.

22:14.027 --> 22:15.658
He had no chance of survival.

22:21.857 --> 22:23.276
I didn't really know her.

22:23.277 --> 22:25.423
Is it true Evan took
an interest in Amanda,

22:25.448 --> 22:26.783
and greenlit her app,

22:26.808 --> 22:28.897
and then all of a sudden, she was gone?

22:29.237 --> 22:31.054
People were saying that Evan...

22:32.030 --> 22:33.710
wanted more than the app.

22:34.445 --> 22:35.648
And when she didn't,

22:37.132 --> 22:38.565
you know... they fired her.

22:38.897 --> 22:40.147
Or she quit.

22:41.857 --> 22:44.477
Is that why you were worried
about his "intentions"?

22:46.397 --> 22:47.499
I'm sorry.

22:47.977 --> 22:50.803
I didn't mean to make you feel
like he wouldn't just see what a...

22:52.027 --> 22:54.736
creative and brilliant engineer you are.

22:54.737 --> 22:57.833
It's okay. I'm sorry I got mad at you.

22:57.858 --> 22:59.428
I know you were just

22:59.453 --> 23:01.113
trying to look out for me.

23:04.476 --> 23:05.551
You okay?

23:07.607 --> 23:11.026
Yeah, just a... feeling in my gut.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.324
I know this is hard for you.

23:17.349 --> 23:19.478
Especially after what Carl told us.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.585
Thank you for coming today.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.890
- It's very sweet.
- It's no great gesture,

23:25.915 --> 23:27.086
being here for you.

23:29.937 --> 23:31.357
I really care about you.

23:32.357 --> 23:34.023
I care about you, too.

23:35.445 --> 23:36.843
And I love...

23:38.737 --> 23:40.187
that you're so passionate

23:40.212 --> 23:42.581
about Jamal's family
getting a fair trial.

23:42.897 --> 23:44.236
Please...

23:44.237 --> 23:45.951
do not do something impulsive

23:45.976 --> 23:48.026
that you might regret
for the rest of your life.

23:58.611 --> 23:59.816
Did you know about this?

23:59.817 --> 24:02.319
- About what?
- Sumi called off the wedding!

24:03.577 --> 24:05.936
- No!
- Yeah, she did it in a text.

24:06.671 --> 24:08.026
I-I'm sorry.

24:08.027 --> 24:09.177
- I-I...
- No, you're not.

24:09.977 --> 24:11.396
This is what you wanted, right?

24:11.397 --> 24:12.436
You want her back?

24:12.763 --> 24:13.896
You can have her.

24:13.897 --> 24:16.526
Hell, why don't you marry her?
You know, it's all set up for you.

24:16.527 --> 24:17.613
- Meera, I...
- No!

24:23.107 --> 24:25.991
How did you get all
the men's salaries info?

24:26.016 --> 24:27.316
I can't reveal my source.

24:27.317 --> 24:28.875
No question, we put it all out there.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.526
- Internally.
- No, online.

24:30.527 --> 24:32.066
Expose the whole tech community.

24:32.067 --> 24:33.896
- Totally, yes.
- Wait, hold on.

24:33.897 --> 24:36.599
if we publicly shame Speckulate,

24:36.624 --> 24:38.106
the company's revenues could suffer

24:38.107 --> 24:39.937
and then we could all be out of a job.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.026
I'm willing to risk it.

24:42.467 --> 24:43.646
- Yeah, me, too.
- Me, too.

24:44.413 --> 24:45.458
Look...

24:45.483 --> 24:47.108
I've been at Speckulate longer

24:47.375 --> 24:48.464
than any of you.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.566
And I put in a lot of time

24:50.567 --> 24:52.606
and I put up with a lot of shit

24:52.607 --> 24:54.299
and I finally earned

24:54.324 --> 24:56.106
my position as a director.

24:56.107 --> 24:57.167
And...

24:58.357 --> 25:00.647
I don't think I'm
willing to blow that up.

25:03.687 --> 25:05.732
I'm sorry but... I'm out.

25:06.724 --> 25:07.865
Casey...

25:08.240 --> 25:09.336
I just can't do it.

25:16.687 --> 25:18.176
Mariana, you have a lot to lose, too.

25:18.977 --> 25:22.107
- You just got your app idea greenlit.
- Yeah, but...

25:23.147 --> 25:25.186
But this is bigger than my career.

25:25.187 --> 25:27.237
This is about doing what's right.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.976
Let's put the list out there.

25:29.977 --> 25:32.356
- Yeah.
- All right.

26:01.437 --> 26:03.736
I understand that Mom was overwhelmed

26:05.056 --> 26:07.356
with two kids, as a single parent,

26:07.357 --> 26:09.397
workin' two jobs, 16 hours a day.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.186
I remember the good times

26:16.949 --> 26:18.637
before the drugs and the alcohol.

26:24.027 --> 26:25.746
I understand...

26:26.561 --> 26:29.040
why she went to them for relief.

26:30.855 --> 26:32.019
Life is hard...

26:33.776 --> 26:34.878
especially...

26:36.003 --> 26:37.816
for people like us who

26:38.582 --> 26:40.692
are living in a world
of white supremacy,

26:42.083 --> 26:45.336
in a world that can treat us
like we're less than human.

26:46.309 --> 26:48.258
I understand.

26:51.857 --> 26:53.737
You and Mom were at peace.

26:55.546 --> 26:56.742
You were a good son.

26:57.874 --> 26:59.195
You can feel good about that.

27:44.857 --> 27:48.596
I do.

27:53.758 --> 27:54.830
I...

27:58.977 --> 28:00.022
...don't.

28:06.671 --> 28:07.997
I do love you...

28:09.684 --> 28:11.020
just not in that way

28:11.277 --> 28:12.307
anymore.

28:14.410 --> 28:15.830
I'll always be your best friend.

28:17.856 --> 28:20.330
And you know, it took a lot of
guts to call off the wedding.

28:21.635 --> 28:24.236
Even though someone spent hours

28:24.237 --> 28:26.337
painstakingly planning the whole thing.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.040
I'm sorry.

28:29.357 --> 28:33.888
But you should marry anyone that
you're not 100% sure is "the one."

28:39.937 --> 28:41.093
I know...

28:43.414 --> 28:44.606
It's all here.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.236
You can't leak those files
to Jamal's attorneys.

28:47.237 --> 28:51.146
You don't know if he made some deal
to get his son's charges dropped.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.656
It's unethical.

28:52.681 --> 28:53.984
- You don't know who they came from.
- I really care about you.

28:54.008 --> 28:55.027
You'd know.

28:55.051 --> 28:56.977
- You could be wrong.
- It's unethical.

31:07.773 --> 31:08.984
Okay, listen up!

31:09.843 --> 31:11.106
Listen up.

31:11.107 --> 31:13.627
I'm sure by now you're
all aware that someone,

31:14.080 --> 31:16.643
in a disgraceful breach of privacy,

31:16.668 --> 31:19.518
posted a list of Speckulate
employee salaries online.

31:19.799 --> 31:20.976
Now, we called this meeting

31:21.375 --> 31:24.360
to demand that if anybody knows
who perpetrated this...

31:24.805 --> 31:25.896
theft...

31:25.897 --> 31:27.180
of company data,

31:27.205 --> 31:28.405
we want to hear from them now.

31:31.438 --> 31:32.816
Let me put this another way.

31:32.817 --> 31:34.048
All right?

31:34.073 --> 31:35.522
This is a...

31:36.633 --> 31:39.122
huge PR problem

31:39.420 --> 31:40.466
for this company.

31:40.491 --> 31:41.927
We could lose clients.

31:42.685 --> 31:44.026
Face lawsuits.

31:44.185 --> 31:46.136
Every single one of your jobs

31:46.161 --> 31:47.767
is at jeopardy right now.

31:48.814 --> 31:50.851
What if you just raised the salaries

31:50.876 --> 31:53.751
of women and people of
color to parity with the men?

31:54.951 --> 31:56.831
Wouldn't that solve the PR problem?

31:58.647 --> 31:59.696
Um...

31:59.897 --> 32:00.976
Okay, so...

32:01.777 --> 32:03.297
here's the thing... we were not...

32:03.596 --> 32:05.236
aware of this disparity.

32:05.237 --> 32:06.296
All right?

32:06.397 --> 32:08.106
Angela, here, the head of HR,

32:08.107 --> 32:10.087
should have brought
this to our attention

32:10.112 --> 32:12.186
a long time ago, and, uh,

32:12.187 --> 32:14.861
I think what we should do,

32:15.165 --> 32:16.290
is to...

32:16.673 --> 32:17.792
hold her accountable.

32:18.431 --> 32:19.476
So...

32:19.477 --> 32:20.626
Angela...

32:21.175 --> 32:22.624
I'm sorry to do this publically

32:22.649 --> 32:23.887
- but you are...
- I did it.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.472
I hacked into HR and I
posted the salaries online.

32:31.437 --> 32:32.437
I did it.

32:33.937 --> 32:36.566
I hacked into HR and
posted the salaries online.

32:38.687 --> 32:39.736
I did it.

32:39.737 --> 32:42.265
I hacked into HR and
posted the salaries online.

32:42.827 --> 32:43.897
I did it.

32:43.898 --> 32:46.436
I hacked into HR and
posted the salaries online.

32:46.437 --> 32:47.437
I did it.

32:47.438 --> 32:50.396
I hacked into HR and
posted the salaries online.

32:50.397 --> 32:51.398
I did it.

32:51.835 --> 32:53.935
I hacked into HR and
posted the salaries online.

32:58.857 --> 33:00.396
Bye, you're all fired.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.356
Yeah, I-I wouldn't do that.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.526
Talk about a PR nightmare.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.099
What's going on here?

33:06.829 --> 33:08.255
Oh, and also,

33:08.280 --> 33:09.920
while we're putting it all out there...

33:10.187 --> 33:11.526
Josh tried to kiss me.

33:11.527 --> 33:13.737
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

33:14.950 --> 33:17.305
Who all here has Josh tried to kiss?

33:18.375 --> 33:19.489
Wow.

33:19.514 --> 33:20.604
Evan...

33:20.837 --> 33:23.088
This is... this... this
is a smear campaign,

33:23.334 --> 33:24.446
is what this is.

33:25.031 --> 33:26.336
I am the victim!

33:27.669 --> 33:28.858
Morning.

33:29.514 --> 33:31.877
Are the plaintiffs ready
to call their next witness?

33:32.796 --> 33:33.965
Yes, your Honor.

33:34.486 --> 33:35.846
The plaintiffs would like to call

33:35.871 --> 33:37.660
Officer Griffin to the
stand at this time.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.306
Officer Griffin.

33:53.978 --> 33:56.973
Is there anything in your personnel file

33:56.998 --> 33:58.564
that you wouldn't want this jury

33:58.589 --> 34:00.629
- to know about?
- Objection, Your Honor.

34:02.134 --> 34:04.764
- Permission to approach the bench.
- Permission granted.

34:10.437 --> 34:13.340
The personnel file of Officer
Griffin is not in evidence.

34:13.364 --> 34:14.905
You ruled to keep it under seal.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.496
What are you up to, Ms. Walker?

34:16.697 --> 34:19.512
- New evidence has come to light.
- We'd like to request a recess

34:19.536 --> 34:22.172
until tomorrow to, uh,
evaluate this evidence.

34:29.991 --> 34:32.371
Hey, it's Sandra, can I come in?

34:47.603 --> 34:49.043
I'm sorry I didn't make it to court.

35:02.372 --> 35:03.852
Yari told me about your mother.

35:06.507 --> 35:08.145
I'm sorry for your loss.

35:09.992 --> 35:11.992
It's okay.

35:13.437 --> 35:15.107
I'm fine, I'm just tired.

35:18.897 --> 35:23.167
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

35:24.892 --> 35:26.061
You know, I, um...

35:27.312 --> 35:30.424
I gave you the wrong advice when I
said we couldn't have our moments.

35:31.573 --> 35:32.846
That we had to be strong.

35:33.698 --> 35:36.377
That... that black superwoman complex.

35:40.061 --> 35:41.275
We don't have to be that.

35:42.928 --> 35:44.208
We can just be real.

35:46.556 --> 35:47.735
We can break down.

35:48.726 --> 35:51.896
We can... We can ask for help.

35:54.531 --> 35:57.867
We can be there for our
sisters, and brothers.

35:59.307 --> 36:00.566
The way you were there for me.

36:08.623 --> 36:09.880
Hey, so,

36:10.437 --> 36:11.740
I want to be honest with you.

36:12.890 --> 36:15.970
It was my idea to expose
the gender and race pay gap.

36:18.006 --> 36:21.153
- And considering everything else...
- What "else"?

36:23.521 --> 36:26.101
You know... everything.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.704
I think it might be best
if I leave Speckulate.

36:33.446 --> 36:34.618
I don't want you to leave.

36:38.528 --> 36:40.647
I'm-I'm glad you brought
this to my attention.

36:41.317 --> 36:43.481
I don't like dealing with the
administrative side of things,

36:43.505 --> 36:44.836
so I had no idea that

36:45.374 --> 36:47.452
women weren't getting
paid the same as men.

36:47.477 --> 36:51.023
But I plan to correct
that, and get rid of Josh.

36:53.788 --> 36:54.908
Please don't leave.

36:57.805 --> 36:58.891
Thank you, but...

37:00.357 --> 37:01.625
I think I have to.

37:04.632 --> 37:07.030
You know maybe I'll develop
my app on my own.

37:08.475 --> 37:09.644
On your own?

37:09.669 --> 37:13.403
Well, yeah, maybe I'll set up
a GoFundMe page or something.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.731
M-Mariana...

37:18.647 --> 37:21.050
if you choose to
leave, I can't stop you.

37:21.597 --> 37:23.402
But you can't take your app with you.

37:24.995 --> 37:27.573
Every idea you had under
contract here belongs to me.

37:36.532 --> 37:38.704
- Hello?
- Hi.

37:39.111 --> 37:41.361
- It's me.
- Where the hell are you?

37:45.924 --> 37:48.332
I drove out to this cliff, by the beach.

37:51.721 --> 37:53.006
I was gonna drive off.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.356
One of the voices that I...

37:56.027 --> 37:58.166
kept hearing in my head was yours.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.406
Really?

38:01.837 --> 38:02.996
What was I saying?

38:03.021 --> 38:05.165
- "Do it."
- Shut up.

38:09.399 --> 38:10.879
I did hear you telling me not to...

38:12.444 --> 38:13.614
be an idiot.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.493
It's not like I'd leave some big

38:17.133 --> 38:18.524
void in the world, but...

38:19.094 --> 38:20.755
it suddenly felt selfish,

38:20.780 --> 38:23.690
like a betrayal of Jacob.

38:26.694 --> 38:28.343
Who fought so hard to live.

38:33.099 --> 38:36.116
How would I explain that to him?

38:37.720 --> 38:38.883
If there is a heaven.

38:41.349 --> 38:42.466
How would I explain.

38:42.943 --> 38:44.155
We put him through so many

38:45.138 --> 38:46.905
tests and drug trials

38:47.373 --> 38:49.126
just to keep him with us.

38:53.713 --> 38:57.266
And then I just throw my life away?

39:05.493 --> 39:06.532
So, I...

39:09.530 --> 39:10.906
drove myself here.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.786
Checked in for a 48-hour hold.

39:19.536 --> 39:21.146
You lost your child.

39:24.771 --> 39:28.513
I can't imagine coping with
all that pain and grief.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.105
Especially when you keep it...

39:31.812 --> 39:33.651
locked up inside of yourself,

39:33.676 --> 39:35.784
and you won't share it with
anyone who cares about you.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.581
Because people do
care about you, Dennis.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.940
I know there would be a huge

39:41.965 --> 39:45.252
void in my life if you weren't here.

40:02.541 --> 40:04.298
I mean, there has to be someone in LA

40:04.323 --> 40:05.825
who needs a last-minute wedding cake.

40:05.826 --> 40:07.921
It's-it's delicious, super moist.

40:08.132 --> 40:09.639
Can I at least get store credit?

40:10.843 --> 40:12.566
Ugh. Hello?

40:15.536 --> 40:16.628
Hey!

40:17.081 --> 40:19.115
So, you guessed it.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.535
There is no more wedding.

40:20.536 --> 40:21.905
And, for the record,

40:21.906 --> 40:23.786
I had almost nothing to do with it.

40:27.368 --> 40:28.535
What's wrong?

40:29.486 --> 40:31.906
This isn't working... for me.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.785
I mean...

40:35.027 --> 40:37.924
was it because of what happened
with my parents yesterday or...?

40:37.949 --> 40:40.724
Well, that was kinda ridiculous.

40:42.334 --> 40:44.420
Why did you introduce me as "Joanna"

40:44.616 --> 40:46.818
and tell your parents that
I live here at The Coterie?

40:47.545 --> 40:49.324
I don't know, it just kind of flew out.

40:49.349 --> 40:51.146
Okay, well, I think I know why.

40:52.115 --> 40:53.305
It's 'cause I look gay.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.256
So, if I'm your friend

40:56.281 --> 40:58.353
then you're guilty by association.

40:59.189 --> 41:01.596
- No...
- Whereas Sumi passes as straight,

41:02.524 --> 41:03.785
so it was never an issue.

41:03.786 --> 41:05.955
- N-no, that's not why...
- Alice.

41:05.956 --> 41:07.405
Look.

41:07.406 --> 41:08.776
Okay, we're sitting.

41:09.971 --> 41:11.057
I don't think...

41:11.581 --> 41:15.253
that the problem is just that
you're not out to your parents.

41:16.326 --> 41:17.405
It's you're not...

41:17.406 --> 41:19.610
out to yourself.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.414
You're not at peace

41:23.270 --> 41:24.366
with being gay.

41:27.019 --> 41:28.690
And that's way scarier.

41:29.956 --> 41:31.808
'Cause if you can't accept yourself...

41:33.792 --> 41:35.162
how can you accept me?

41:41.996 --> 41:44.325
I'm voting there's maple frosting.

41:44.326 --> 41:45.615
I think it's pecan.

41:46.250 --> 41:47.555
I'm so tired.

41:48.166 --> 41:51.035
Wait, did they really just
stop the trial for a whole day?

41:51.036 --> 41:52.075
Yeah.

41:52.576 --> 41:54.536
And did we ever find out
what the new evidence is?

41:54.996 --> 41:56.116
Nope.

41:58.166 --> 42:00.206
- What's gonna happen with your app?
- I don't know.

42:01.235 --> 42:02.399
I mean, if I leave Speckulate,

42:02.423 --> 42:05.281
we can't keep it, and if I do stay,

42:05.306 --> 42:06.905
things could get weird with my boss

42:06.906 --> 42:08.906
who I think is interested
in more than just my app.

42:09.097 --> 42:10.176
Gross.

42:10.201 --> 42:11.951
- Ugh.
- Evan?

42:14.091 --> 42:16.705
Hey, has... has anyone
heard from Dennis?

42:16.706 --> 42:19.325
Uh, yeah, he finally called me back.

42:19.326 --> 42:21.365
He decided to take a road trip.

42:21.366 --> 42:24.285
- And he's had really bad reception.
- Mmm.

42:24.286 --> 42:25.825
Hey, where's Joey?

42:26.458 --> 42:27.903
Uh... working.

42:28.723 --> 42:29.825
She had a...

42:29.826 --> 42:32.285
- shift that just came up.
- By the way,

42:32.598 --> 42:34.995
I'm not moving back to Wisconsin.

42:34.996 --> 42:37.293
I've decided to sign
on for another year,

42:37.318 --> 42:38.817
and get my masters in teaching.

42:39.037 --> 42:41.587
- Yes!
- Here, here!

42:41.612 --> 42:42.731
Thanks.

42:42.927 --> 42:44.711
I'd like to make another toast.

42:44.736 --> 42:46.445
To The Coterie at the Palace.

42:46.470 --> 42:48.865
"An intentional community." Hm...

42:48.866 --> 42:51.707
"... where we share resources to

42:51.732 --> 42:54.260
enrich our lives and the lives..."

42:54.285 --> 42:56.229
"... of others by
cultivating friendship,

42:56.254 --> 42:57.365
social progress..."

42:57.366 --> 42:58.865
"... and artistic expression."

42:58.866 --> 43:00.955
I've never been more proud.

43:00.956 --> 43:02.104
You know I wrote it myself.

43:02.129 --> 43:04.479
- To The Coterie.
- To The Coterie!

43:15.826 --> 43:17.405
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

43:17.406 --> 43:18.606
- Um...
- Alice?

43:19.200 --> 43:21.707
- Why you call so late?
- Can you put Dad on, too?

43:22.231 --> 43:23.614
Okay, hold on.

43:23.864 --> 43:25.629
No, I don't... I don't want...

43:26.521 --> 43:28.239
I'm not trying to FaceTime.

43:28.264 --> 43:29.264
Okay.

43:30.131 --> 43:31.286
What's wrong?

43:32.906 --> 43:34.786
Nothing's wrong.

43:37.249 --> 43:39.467
There's just something
that I need to tell you.

43:40.858 --> 43:42.389
Did Sumi get married?

43:43.014 --> 43:45.178
Is that why you're crying?

43:46.209 --> 43:47.412
What do you mean?

43:47.437 --> 43:51.221
- To that girl Meera?
- Is your heart broken?

43:54.509 --> 43:55.579
Um...

43:56.587 --> 43:58.111
why would my heart be broken?

43:59.233 --> 44:00.311
Because...

44:01.350 --> 44:02.491
you loved her.

44:07.764 --> 44:10.205
How did... I mean...

44:10.206 --> 44:12.709
you knew?

44:14.006 --> 44:15.995
We've known for a long time.

44:15.996 --> 44:18.855
We've just been waiting
for you to tell us.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.326
We love you, Alice.

44:22.814 --> 44:26.665
We still want you to get
married, and have grandchildren.

44:28.706 --> 44:31.365
That, uh, Joanna seems nice.

44:40.812 --> 44:45.460
_

44:58.826 --> 45:02.115
Hey.

45:06.866 --> 45:08.866
What're you doing here?

45:10.803 --> 45:12.222
I thought you were back home.

45:12.247 --> 45:13.446
I was.

45:14.666 --> 45:17.666
But then I flew back because
I wanted to tell you in person.

45:19.317 --> 45:20.419
I left Lily.

45:23.831 --> 45:24.970
Well, I'm beat.

45:25.996 --> 45:28.496
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night.

45:34.406 --> 45:35.996
So...

45:37.996 --> 45:39.280
I did a thing today.

45:40.999 --> 45:43.115
I can't believe you
took the fall for Angela.

45:43.641 --> 45:44.704
You know, you're a...

45:45.724 --> 45:46.899
pretty amazing person.

45:48.406 --> 45:50.785
Well, you stood up there with us.

45:50.786 --> 45:52.285
Talk about amazingness.

45:55.401 --> 45:58.955
You know, I know we're
colleagues, and...

45:58.956 --> 46:03.215
I don't want you to think I don't
respect you as a brilliant engineer

46:03.790 --> 46:04.931
but...

46:05.533 --> 46:07.264
do you mind if I kiss you?

46:10.786 --> 46:13.035
Uh, yeah, that would kinda
be really disrespectful

46:13.036 --> 46:14.825
and inappropriate...

46:14.826 --> 46:16.785
I'm so kidding, please kiss me.

46:16.786 --> 46:18.206
Please.

46:28.286 --> 46:29.575
Oh, my God.

46:29.576 --> 46:31.996
I know.

46:34.496 --> 46:35.614
So...

46:36.997 --> 46:38.141
what're you gonna do?

46:38.786 --> 46:39.848
About what?

46:40.825 --> 46:42.095
Who are you gonna choose?

46:43.379 --> 46:45.645
Jamie or Gael?
