Target Nakasumi San

00:49.100 --> 00:50.800
It's impossible!

00:50.800 --> 00:54.800
No, but there is near.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.400
Ron

01:11.400 --> 01:15.400
I'm working on it!

01:15.500 --> 01:18.100
Oh Thank you!

01:18.100 --> 01:20.400
Sumo Ninja?!

01:20.400 --> 01:23.500

01:23.500 --> 01:25.300
This is wrong.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.000
I am your doom!

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Rufus, help!

01:37.500 --> 01:40.600
Mouse Bald, strange enough for you?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.600
You will suffer!

01:42.600 --> 01:43.800
Kim

01:43.800 --> 01:46.000
Just a second.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Ron

01:53.800 --> 01:54.600
Ah, this movement ...

01:54.600 --> 01:58.600

02:17.600 --> 02:19.700
Gotcha!

02:19.700 --> 02:22.600
I'm right behind you KP.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.700
Oh my! I did not put the skids jet this morning!

02:31.400 --> 02:35.400
But I put my underwear propulsion.

02:40.900 --> 02:44.900
Huh?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.300
Hey Wade, what's going on?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.600
It's a bad time?

02:50.600 --> 02:54.200
Remember that the president
Toys Nakasumi thought was in danger?

02:54.200 --> 02:54.900
Yes

02:54.900 --> 02:56.900
He was right.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.200
Hang in there.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.200
I'm up for the GPS system.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Kim, U. curve

03:16.700 --> 03:20.700
Kim, Monique wants to talk
but you seem a bit busy.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.800
A bit.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.000
It was important, was something about Bonnie and Brick

03:24.000 --> 03:26.200
What? Put it online!

03:26.200 --> 03:27.400
Ok, ok.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.800
Monique, together or apart?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.400
Together again!

03:30.400 --> 03:34.100
How many times is that two people
can stop and walk back together?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.800
She loves the drama.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.800
Oh, she just needs to pair to the prom.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.100
Oh, this is bad!

03:42.100 --> 03:43.900
Yes, they deserve each other.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.400
No, I mean this is bad.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.400
Monique, I have to go.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.600
Thanks, Ron

04:13.700 --> 04:14.800
Shego

04:14.800 --> 04:18.800
Oh, look, partner!

04:25.100 --> 04:29.100
Sorry!

04:50.400 --> 04:54.400
I got you, Man of Toys!

04:56.900 --> 05:00.900
Ggrrrrrrr

05:13.700 --> 05:17.700
One day, we even take away that dryer!

05:24.100 --> 05:26.800
(Kim Possible - The Drama of Love)

06:13.100 --> 06:13.900
The situation Wade?

06:13.900 --> 06:16.600
I'm handling the case Drakken / Nakasumi
but so far nothing!

06:16.600 --> 06:18.300
I can not see ...

06:18.300 --> 06:22.300
Yes, I do not understand why he tried to abduct
the Nakasumi, rather than to steal the technology.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.400
Yes, but in fact was
talking about this work of Geometria.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.500
Oh Would you take a look?

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
No, I do ask for help from a super genius is cheating.
I'll ask Ron!

06:32.400 --> 06:34.500
Any luck on the number seven?

06:34.500 --> 06:36.300
Ah, very tricky.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.200
Ron?

06:38.200 --> 06:42.000
The number seven is very tricky, then come back to that.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.800
How is running this test?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.600
I will please Stoppable San.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.500
And where is the San Stoppable?

06:50.500 --> 06:54.500
Ron

06:56.800 --> 07:00.000
Miss Possible, welcome
and once again thank you.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.100
Not great, thanks for the ride
home, saw Ron?

07:03.100 --> 07:07.100
Rufus, is supposed to be the one to lead!

07:12.300 --> 07:13.500
Ron

07:13.500 --> 07:17.500
Yes, talk to the driver nu.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.700
San Nakasumi says not to get worried
your job is to create fun ...

07:25.500 --> 07:29.500
Your friend is a great consumer
still full of childish beauty.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.800
Maybe a little too much.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.800
No way, this is just what I
I think it is? Tiki Warf Boo! Bugs Bun!

07:39.900 --> 07:42.400
You create these characters that Mr. Nakasumi?

07:42.400 --> 07:45.700
Yes, he creates them alone.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.900
It's your personal touch.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.900
Oh, come on, you just draw these dolls and
Suddenly all the kids want a planet?

07:52.200 --> 07:55.100
Yes, but do not tell the
sponsors is so easy.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.700
They can take me the jet.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.900
Ah, you noticed my!

08:00.900 --> 08:02.300
Wait, you speak English?

08:02.300 --> 08:06.100
Oh, quite fluently, but I
whispering in the ears of Miss Kioko

08:06.100 --> 08:09.600
San Nakasumi is a little, as they say ... cheeky.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.400
Ok, I guess that comes with the scene
to be the creator of toys.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.900
San Stoppable, on behalf of cooperation Nakasumi

08:15.900 --> 08:19.300
accept our gratitude for your
effort to rescue Nakasumi San.

08:19.300 --> 08:23.300
What works hard to create toys.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.400
San Nakasumi

08:26.400 --> 08:28.100
we are approaching the airport Middleton.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.400
The pilot must be about to land.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.400
Okay, can leave us already here.

08:36.799 --> 08:40.700
It is time to open the parachute!

08:40.700 --> 08:42.600
Ah My homework!

08:42.600 --> 08:46.600
What serves you well!

08:55.100 --> 08:57.100
Good morning Dr. Possible!

08:57.100 --> 08:58.600
You too Dr. Possible!

08:58.600 --> 09:00.800
Day crazy, three surgeries before lunch, and you?

09:00.800 --> 09:03.100
I will finish the project Hephaestus,

09:03.100 --> 09:05.400
3 years, 3 billion dollars.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.700
I hope it.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.800
More coffee dear?

09:07.800 --> 09:10.600
Are you sure you want to delete the file Hephaestus?

09:10.600 --> 09:11.500
Yes, please!

09:11.500 --> 09:14.700
Recognized standard voice of Dr. Possible,
activated process of elimination.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.100
No, no, no

09:16.100 --> 09:17.900
Abort, abort.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.400
Process of elimination aborted.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.000
No problem dear
I have everything up here.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.800
Kids eaten?

09:22.800 --> 09:26.800
Jim and Tim are on the fourth
working on a secret invention.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.300
Like father, like son.

09:28.300 --> 09:32.300
I have not seen the Kimmie.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.600
Good morning!

09:34.600 --> 09:36.500
You're a little late Kimmie

09:36.500 --> 09:39.800
Yes, it slows me a bit
having to go wrong landed,

09:39.800 --> 09:43.200
but Ron is a fearful
when it comes to free fall.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.100
Kimmie, where were you last night?

09:45.100 --> 09:49.100
The tycoon was saved toys
yesterday by the teenage heroine Kim Possible.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.200
That's my girl!

09:51.200 --> 09:52.700
Oh, it was great father,

09:52.700 --> 09:55.800
addition to the Supreme Ninja
that was pretty big.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.600
Sumo Ninja ...

09:57.600 --> 10:01.600
I have not had to worry about
Sumo Ninja when I was your age.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.100
What a nice stroke, Kimmie

10:13.100 --> 10:17.000
Lower yourself father!

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Imbeciles!

10:18.000 --> 10:19.100
Mother, father,

10:19.100 --> 10:23.100
seen our ...

10:23.700 --> 10:24.900
You did it.

10:24.900 --> 10:28.300
Why do not you play with
games like normal kids?

10:28.300 --> 10:29.300
And play.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.500
We use them as parts.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.300
True.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.100
Nothing missile inside kids.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.000
Ok!

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
This is what happens when a scientist
space and a neurosurgeon reproduce.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.100
(Lair secret)

10:51.300 --> 10:53.100
The machine absorption brain
is ready for the prisoner.

10:53.100 --> 10:57.100
No prisoner will absorb your brain.

10:58.300 --> 11:02.300
You've failed me for the last time, Shego

11:11.500 --> 11:15.500
Your Sintodromes are improving,
they could even win a fair fight ...

11:15.700 --> 11:17.200
penalty is not my style.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.700
Sintodrome 842 to finish the job.

11:24.700 --> 11:28.700
Shego, you must always destroy my toys?

11:28.700 --> 11:32.700
Ok, because you must always be, "Dost thou fail me last time"?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.100
Are you kidding me with this?

11:35.100 --> 11:39.100
No, Shego came time
elevate the game to the next level!

11:39.300 --> 11:42.600
Oh, I especially liked
this number 842.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.600
Had a certain beauty in
floor and a twinkle in his eyes.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.600
No, I think it is
substance Sintodrome.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.700
Can get a mop here?

11:49.700 --> 11:53.700
Shego, come with me and talk to me!

11:54.300 --> 11:56.400
You'd say I'm bad?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.200
Oh, not this again!

11:58.200 --> 11:59.900
Shego, please be honest!

11:59.900 --> 12:02.600
Yes, you are very bad.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.300
Oh, Anderson, crucial
the program of life changing.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.100
Yes, I suppose you're right.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.100
Dr. D. see if you understand ...

12:10.100 --> 12:12.400
Nobody does super weapons like you.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.100
Look at that ray of annihilation.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.100
It is evil in the design ...

12:16.100 --> 12:18.100
and saves energy.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.300
See, there you go.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.200
And the things I'm doing in
torture chamber are very exciting.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.300
That's what I'm talking about.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.500
You definitely ... you are crazy.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.600
My last research project,
teenagers!

12:32.600 --> 12:34.900
I'll get the head of Kim Possible

12:34.900 --> 12:38.900
and I find his weakness.

12:38.900 --> 12:39.800
Stevens, report!

12:39.800 --> 12:41.600
So, D-Diggity Dog!

12:41.600 --> 12:43.000
We've lost Stevens!

12:43.000 --> 12:43.800
Sorry Dr. Drakken?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.000
What is it?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Without a brain to absorb the machine
absorb brain is useless and a waste.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.600
Gggrrr, Give me that!

12:55.300 --> 12:58.400
Why are you so happy?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.600
Oh, nothing only the first
step to world conquest.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.000
Whatever ...
Let me see it

13:04.000 --> 13:05.600
Shego

13:05.600 --> 13:09.600
A doll you are so weird.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.400
Oh no, are you trying to be cool again?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.200
Serve with your mother.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.100
Ah

13:16.100 --> 13:20.100
Go, Mad Dogs!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.400
It was so pointless.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.000
Like it's always about you!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.500
That ego disappears with Kim.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.500
Brick dear, I appear
when you have finished exercising.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.600
Two hours? Ok, oh and do not take a shower,

13:33.600 --> 13:34.900
I like when you are sweating.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.300
When you're sweating?

13:36.300 --> 13:37.700
You could be more unhealthy?!

13:37.700 --> 13:39.800
Oh, how you and your boyfriend?

13:39.800 --> 13:43.200
Oops, I forgot, you do not have
a boyfriend, not because Kim?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.300
Too busy to "save the world."

13:45.300 --> 13:46.800
You're still you use quotes?!

13:46.800 --> 13:49.000
Ah, interesting.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.300
I'm with Brick Flagg, football,
hockey, top of the food chain.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.100
Tara you are with Jason Morgan,
the star of the basketball team.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.500
The Jessica with Steve Farley,
the captain of the baseball team.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.800
Football, athletics, lacrosse, ice hockey.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.300
Face the facts, all
acceptable boys have been busy.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.200
There is a term which
I have no knowledge?

14:05.200 --> 14:06.700
The Ball.

14:06.700 --> 14:07.700
It's just a ball.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.100
Experience, "The Ball", with
Who do you type is crucial.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.600
You still going with the
captain of the chess team.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.800
Hey, KP.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.100
Or worse!

14:16.100 --> 14:19.400
We have a meeting at Bueno Nacho, or what?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.800
Girl, this is bullshit.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.800
I know, but what if by Bonnie
some stupid reason right?

14:26.200 --> 14:26.900
Oh, shut up!

14:26.900 --> 14:29.400
I mean, and if there
something wrong with me, Monique?

14:29.400 --> 14:31.200
Why are not you dating
a football player.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.400
I'm running the boys, they see me on TV

14:34.400 --> 14:37.400
skating to the windows of buildings ...

14:37.400 --> 14:38.500
Images are true.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.200
Kim, you are a woman
strong and independent

14:41.200 --> 14:43.500
who has this fear
not worth your time

14:43.500 --> 14:46.400
Yes maybe, but what if she is right?

14:46.400 --> 14:49.900
Is there anything sadder than going
the ball with your "just friend"?

14:49.900 --> 14:51.100
And his bald mice.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.000
Four nachos, three burritos and a salad.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.600
Oh, extra cheese on it!

14:55.600 --> 14:56.300
Si

14:56.300 --> 14:58.300
That is 7.52.

14:58.300 --> 15:02.300
Tricked up Ned, this is a
order Naco Night, so they are 4.98.

15:02.300 --> 15:06.300
Sorry, the promotion of
Naco Night has been canceled.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.600
You cancel the Naco Night?

15:11.600 --> 15:14.400
I do not have that power,
was the new management.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.200
What new management?

15:15.200 --> 15:17.600
Someone bought the whole "enchilada".

15:17.600 --> 15:20.400
I can give you the 800 number if you want
express a comment or criticism.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.200
Oh yes, I have some criticisms.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.100
I mean a "par par" was cool,

15:27.100 --> 15:28.600
a lousy boyfriend.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
You are leaving Bonnie control you.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.700
I am not.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.700
What good is saving the world
do not have anyone to share!

15:35.800 --> 15:38.300
Ok, a little.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.300
Just once I would like to
make swallowing what he said.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.400
All we want.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.200
KP, life as
know it changed forever

15:45.200 --> 15:48.900
just to Naco Night.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.500
Oh, and I need three more dollars.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.400
What was Wade?

15:51.400 --> 15:55.400
Discovered Drakken, is the "Bermuda Triangle".

16:00.200 --> 16:04.200
I'm here to see your boss.

16:04.500 --> 16:08.500
Shego, gives a tip to the man.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.600
Thanks for the ride Mr. Belly.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.200
Kim was the least I could do
after saving me from that hurricane.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.500
Not great, nor was a super storm.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.600
It was easy.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.700
Eyes and ears alert Rufus,
this place is bad.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.700
We went, we do what
want and let's go.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.400
All right, Shego, I will
question this common criminal.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.300
What's his name again?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.700
Big Daddy Brotherson.

16:44.700 --> 16:45.600
But you know ...

16:45.600 --> 16:48.000
Please, I'm a super genius,

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I think I can deal with the "Big Daddy".

17:04.900 --> 17:08.900
(Do not exceed this limit)

18:12.600 --> 18:14.400
You think you are
try to keep us apart?

18:14.400 --> 18:18.400
We are in disguise!

18:29.000 --> 18:30.500
What is it? It was my father

18:30.500 --> 18:34.500
he bought it for your homecoming,
never been used.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.900
Big Daddy, Drakken, I realize ...

18:38.900 --> 18:42.300
Na, na, na, the password.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.300
Password?

18:43.300 --> 18:47.300
What password?

18:48.200 --> 18:51.300
You had the password?

18:51.300 --> 18:53.400
You could have mentioned
password.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.400
I thought a genius
would like you to discover.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.800
Shego, I'm not a
particularly patient man.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.800
Ok obstacle password is ...

19:04.300 --> 19:08.300
Nina!

19:08.700 --> 19:12.700
Sit down!

19:20.100 --> 19:23.100
The bathroom
Ladies, perfect.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.000
Lip Color Laser, beautiful!

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Hey, why is that Wade never
me merrily on toys?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.600
Because almost dissolvest up
fingers with one.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
It looked like a nail varnish normal.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.400
The bathroom of ladies, Ron.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.200
Hang in there!

19:59.500 --> 20:03.500
Dude, you are "The Kid"?

20:04.100 --> 20:07.300
Yes, yes, I am.

20:07.300 --> 20:11.000
I have money, you have the information?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.800
Put the money on the table!

20:12.800 --> 20:14.200
Put the information in the table!

20:14.200 --> 20:15.700
You first.

20:15.700 --> 20:19.700
Look I have no time for silly games.

20:23.300 --> 20:27.300
He likes to play silly games.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.400
Wade, I'm inside,
any sign of Drakken?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.000
Not that I can see.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Shego?
Turn around!

21:06.100 --> 21:09.500
Wade, where's Ron?

21:09.500 --> 21:13.500
Here you Kid, five million
in gambling chips!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
These are mine?

21:16.500 --> 21:20.500
I mean, yes, good, my money.

21:20.700 --> 21:24.700
Miss me guys?

21:47.200 --> 21:49.300
This was a bold move.

21:49.300 --> 21:49.800
It?

21:49.800 --> 21:50.900
You're good at this.

21:50.900 --> 21:51.400
I?

21:51.400 --> 21:55.400
Hey, you know how you see that one
man is lying?

21:55.500 --> 21:59.400
Like, he does not look in her eyes.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.400
Or maybe start playing the guy.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Your breathing becomes
irregular and shallow.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.300
Three cowboys!

22:15.300 --> 22:18.400
Ah, go fishing!

22:18.400 --> 22:20.900
Ok, good game, we will not wait
so long next time ...

22:20.935 --> 22:24.900
Woh, you should stay until Pagares
these chips with your money, Kid

22:26.900 --> 22:30.900
I. .. am ... I ...

22:34.200 --> 22:38.200
KP.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.500
Yo, the Kid came

22:47.500 --> 22:51.500
let's put this party to move.

22:52.700 --> 22:56.700
Sorry, I just ...

23:10.800 --> 23:14.800
Ah Ah Now with this super secret code

23:15.500 --> 23:18.000
Milk, bread, eggs?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.400
What kind of code is this?

23:19.400 --> 23:23.400
My shopping list
you are very weak in the game trade.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.300
Shego

23:27.300 --> 23:29.700
Well, I already had my fun.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.600
Glad you having fun.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.800
Now, where can I find
technology Cibertron I need.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.800
Ah Cybertechnology! Some of the most
bright planet struggle with its challenges.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.100
But surely someone already decoded.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.700
Yes, just a genius to do it.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.100
Huh?

23:48.100 --> 23:52.100
Dr. James Timothy Possible.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.300
Oh Irony, and is on my side this time!

24:14.600 --> 24:18.600
Kim

24:21.300 --> 24:22.600
Where is the Drakken and the
What is he planning?

24:22.600 --> 24:26.600
Yes, as I understand
plans crazy. Please.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Shego, it is time to fly.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Until next princess!

24:36.500 --> 24:40.500
You think you can all
but you are not even close.

24:41.300 --> 24:45.300
This is so irritating.

24:48.100 --> 24:52.100
Brick, you are going to be so good indeed!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.300
KP.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.200
Hey, Ron!

24:59.200 --> 25:01.500
I have good news, Naco Night is back!

25:01.500 --> 25:03.100
Seriously Great.

25:03.100 --> 25:06.400
Well, not right, but when they see it.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.200
A piece of paper with your name on it.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.200
Is a petition

25:10.200 --> 25:11.700
'll probably need
more signatures.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.700
Probably.

25:12.700 --> 25:16.700
Well we are talking about
Bueno Nacho, we will succeed.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.900
Actually Ron, I ...

25:18.900 --> 25:19.800
What?

25:19.800 --> 25:21.400
I'm walking home.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.400
Oh, okay, cool.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.100
Goodbye.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.900
KP, I think I know
why are you so.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.400
You know?

25:34.400 --> 25:37.500
Yes, it's because I screwed up and helped
the Drakken and Shego to flee.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.200
Oh, no, I am used to it.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.200
I mean, you know, we get them.

25:46.200 --> 25:46.900
Thank you.

25:46.900 --> 25:47.700
Not great.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.600
Wrong, very big, I can
always count on you.

25:50.600 --> 25:54.600
Sure.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.800
Father, can we talk?

25:57.800 --> 26:00.500
Course Kimmie, wait a minute ...

26:00.500 --> 26:03.200
Ok, he says, have all my attention.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.100
It's about boys.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.800
Ah ... Ah ... Ah ...

26:09.800 --> 26:11.700
Boys and dating.

26:11.700 --> 26:15.400
Ah ... Ah ... Hello dear, you got a minute,

26:15.400 --> 26:17.800
Kimmie needs to talk to you.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.000
It's your mother.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.300
Mother? The Bonnie is coming out with the Brick

26:21.300 --> 26:23.600
so keeps buzzing,
is only the ball boys and stupid

26:23.600 --> 26:25.400
and the food chain ...

26:25.400 --> 26:27.000
e. .. e. .. and I'll end up with Ron

26:27.000 --> 26:29.600
I do not see the crisis dear
he is a very nice guy.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.400
Mother, it's not a boy,

26:31.400 --> 26:32.800
is Ron.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.400
So as a friend ok?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.000
Well, yes, he is my best friend.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.700
But it is not material for boyfriend!

26:38.700 --> 26:40.400
Obviously.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.400
Because of the food chain.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.800
No, yes, and more or less.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.700
The person who you'll agree.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.000
My son still has no partner.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Seriously Kevin still has no partner?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.700
Mother, do not put me in "hands free"
again, do you?

26:53.700 --> 26:54.700
Hello, Kim!

26:54.700 --> 26:55.700
Mother!

26:55.700 --> 26:58.300
Dear hands free is the only
way you can talk to you.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.200
Really Kim, Kevin is a super kid,

27:00.200 --> 27:02.700
the other kids in the chess club
are always trying to imitate him.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.900
Ah, yes, Dr. Goberman,

27:04.900 --> 27:07.700
Kevin has the game!

27:07.700 --> 27:09.000
Ah, it's better off.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.200
After we Kimmie.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.400
And I say to Kevin to call you ...

27:13.400 --> 27:15.400
Monique, you were quite right.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.900
I know.

27:16.900 --> 27:17.900
One in relation to what?

27:17.900 --> 27:19.600
The problem of Bonnie, no longer bothers me.

27:19.600 --> 27:23.200
Who cares about the chain
food, Ron and I are fine.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.700
It keeps you clinging to Ron.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.100
I mean, it's ...

27:27.100 --> 27:29.400
filled with beautiful children.

27:29.400 --> 27:33.300
Sometimes when I am alone and
my machine to cross the street

27:33.300 --> 27:37.300
is as if I lost myself.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.400
See you at school.

27:38.400 --> 27:38.800
Goodbye Ron.

27:38.800 --> 27:42.800
Keep the seriousness girls.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Do you mind?

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
My ... im ... by ... tas ... te?

27:57.900 --> 27:58.600
What?

27:58.600 --> 28:02.300
The place is mine, its disabled.

28:02.300 --> 28:06.000
Oh, sorry, do not even see you.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.800
You know, this may seem odd, but

28:07.800 --> 28:10.100
sometimes when I'm just
I and my machine

28:10.100 --> 28:11.500
and streets

28:11.500 --> 28:14.600
Yes, I know exactly what you are talking about.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
I'm Ron, Ron Stoppable.

28:16.600 --> 28:20.600
Hey, I'm Eric.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.700
Woh, this is a Bald Mouse?

28:24.700 --> 28:28.700
Yes, most people do not realize it,
think that Rufus is a hamster bald.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.400
I always wanted a bald mice.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.100
I, too, which is good because I

28:34.100 --> 28:37.500
I have one, which is really your name?

28:37.500 --> 28:41.500
Eric, my friend, do not know the fate
you have for having known Ron Stoppable,

28:41.900 --> 28:44.400
I know all of what is happening here.

28:44.400 --> 28:48.400
Excellent, where I will get
my school work?

28:48.500 --> 28:52.500
Yes, well I'm not connected to a type
details, I'm more "giant portrait.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.900
This is the canteen where you can say
find a nutritious hot meal,

28:56.900 --> 29:00.300
I have not found, but you can look.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.000
Who is that?

29:02.000 --> 29:05.200
Ah, the lady in the canteen, believes
you can not make the redundant.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.700
No, the girl.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.500
Ah, that's Kim, Kim Possible.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.600
Weird Name.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.300
Never heard of Kim Possible?

29:12.300 --> 29:13.700
She often saves the world,

29:13.700 --> 29:17.700
and I help as well, often.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.300
So you know it?

29:19.300 --> 29:20.600
Yes, we are always together.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.100
Valentine?

29:21.100 --> 29:25.100
The Kim and I, no, no, no, we are
best friends since, well, forever,

29:25.700 --> 29:27.700
But not this way, it is ...

29:27.700 --> 29:29.400
Extremely sexy!

29:29.400 --> 29:33.400
Ok, let's never speak of it
this way, okay?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.200
Whatever smart.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.200
I want the mushroom risotto,
with chopped pepper and grated Parmesan
cool, and please put much truffle oil.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.900
Hi, Ron.

29:52.900 --> 29:53.700
Hi

29:53.700 --> 29:56.200
Hey Eric, pull up a chair and join us.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.700
It is not interesting.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.600
Actually this is my chair,

30:00.600 --> 30:02.100
not have my name on it, but ...

30:02.100 --> 30:04.300
Hello, I'm Eric, how are you?

30:04.300 --> 30:07.200
Girl, I just go from "then" to "whoa"!

30:07.200 --> 30:08.600
Huh?

30:08.600 --> 30:11.500
It takes a while to understand the language of Monique.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.700
What about you?

30:12.700 --> 30:16.700
What do I have?

30:17.200 --> 30:20.700
The Kim is so playful.

30:20.700 --> 30:23.100
I mentioned that we know from pre-school?

30:23.100 --> 30:27.100
Beautiful days, beautiful days!

30:29.400 --> 30:33.400
I feel that just formed
a relationship and I'm not in it.

31:13.700 --> 31:16.900
Attention please, we have found honey in the area.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.800
I repeat, "honey" in the area.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.700
This can only mean one thing:

31:20.700 --> 31:23.700
The Kim has a boyfriend!

31:23.700 --> 31:25.300
Ponytails, cool!

31:25.300 --> 31:27.000
Shut up!

31:27.000 --> 31:28.600
Thank you again for
invited me to dinner.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.500
Not great.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.000
There is but one.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.000
You're right on that.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.700
What do you want the pizza?

31:37.700 --> 31:38.200
Pepperoni!

31:38.200 --> 31:39.600
You owe me a soda!

31:39.600 --> 31:40.800
Dear.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.800
Hey, stand in the queue, she owed me
a soda before I met you.

31:46.100 --> 31:50.100
No soda for you!

31:57.700 --> 31:58.400
Hi.

31:58.400 --> 31:58.800
Hello dear.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.200
Today we eat pizza, the usual bacon?

32:00.200 --> 32:02.600
Correct dear.

32:02.600 --> 32:06.200
Ok, I'll try not to get too late. Love you

32:06.200 --> 32:10.200
Come on, Dad needs
some replication Cibertron.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.000
Oh, amazing.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
The project is a success Hephaestus, who is the man?

32:19.200 --> 32:20.700
I'm the man.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.700
The man who wants the project Hephaestus.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.900
Ron

32:33.900 --> 32:36.200
Ah, actually Dr. P. I have ...

32:36.200 --> 32:38.800
Ah ... .. Ah Hum ... Abdominal pains.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.200
I have a stethoscope in the car.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.000
I'm kidding!

32:43.000 --> 32:43.800
Why do not you?

32:43.800 --> 32:44.700
Well ..

32:44.700 --> 32:45.900
Goodbye Ron.

32:45.900 --> 32:46.900
Again?

32:48.900 --> 32:52.900
Code red!

32:53.900 --> 32:56.600
He has always been a supporter of the drama, I think ...

32:56.600 --> 32:58.300
He's fine.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.700
Pizza father is cool.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.900
Cool, we can heat it?

33:00.900 --> 33:03.000
No, the fire department said:

33:03.000 --> 33:06.300
"Do not do more fusion experiments"

33:06.300 --> 33:09.400
Where is your father?

33:09.400 --> 33:12.000
My teenage daughter is not afraid of you,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.600
why should I have, Dru?

33:14.600 --> 33:16.200
I hate when you call me that.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.300
I'm not the man who
met during college, Possible.

33:19.300 --> 33:22.700
But still you can not
find pair, I bet.

33:22.700 --> 33:26.500
Why is all that I capture Possible
feel the need to give me a sermon?

33:26.500 --> 33:30.500
Nobody respects the relationship raptor / captive?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.900
The society was completely destroyed!

33:33.900 --> 33:37.900
If I may interrupt your monologue
to point out that I will not tell anything about the project.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.000
Oh, I anticipated that.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.600
You know what they say:

33:42.600 --> 33:46.600
"If you make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs "

33:49.300 --> 33:53.100
Ok, hold up a moment.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.800
Are you sure you want to delete the file Hephaestus?

33:55.800 --> 33:56.300
No!

33:56.300 --> 33:58.300
Yes!

33:58.300 --> 34:00.600
Standard voice of Dr. Possible recognized.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.700
You delete it?!

34:01.700 --> 34:02.700
Are you crazy?

34:02.700 --> 34:06.300
No worries, it's all here.

34:06.300 --> 34:10.000
Good news then, because I have
machine to absorb brains

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
and was dying to try it.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
My, you do not have a tie.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
The tie is gone.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.199
But you're the assistant manager.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.699
Not anymore, now is the work of Lars.

34:31.699 --> 34:32.800
Lars?

34:32.800 --> 34:35.199
The office sent him, change is in the air.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.100
Serious changes, meals for children.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.800
With toys in them?

34:39.800 --> 34:40.900
Affirmative.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.000
Wait, wait a second, I do not understand what is wrong with that?

34:43.000 --> 34:46.199
Imagine a bread factory, along with
an amusement park ...

34:46.199 --> 34:48.900
and then what, a clown for the holidays?

34:48.900 --> 34:52.900
Seriously As think
who won that?

34:55.000 --> 34:58.300
Kim, 911

34:58.300 --> 35:00.500
The Drakken has my father.

35:00.500 --> 35:04.500
(secret hideout)

35:05.900 --> 35:08.100
Do not like it, seems very ...

35:08.100 --> 35:08.800
"Armardilhoado"?

35:08.800 --> 35:12.800
Not a word, but yes.

35:19.800 --> 35:23.800
Kim Possible and her partner, whose name fails me ...

35:24.200 --> 35:28.200
After all the times we played them,
how can he not know my name?

35:28.200 --> 35:31.300
Possible Girl would do well to save energy

35:31.300 --> 35:35.300
his father is in dire straits.

35:36.600 --> 35:40.600
Father

35:41.100 --> 35:45.100
I must warn you, my last
invention is deadly death!

35:45.400 --> 35:47.900
This is not redundant?

35:47.900 --> 35:51.900
KP.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.800
I liked being able to be there,

36:00.800 --> 36:03.400
but I'm busy in changing
to my new hideout.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.100
The cache which will conquer the world!

36:06.100 --> 36:08.300
Goodbye, Kim Possible!

36:08.300 --> 36:10.900
Goodbye, what was his name?

36:10.900 --> 36:13.400
Does not matter, you know who you are.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.200
I mean, is not a difficult name to remember.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.000
Ron.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Yes, thank you!

36:29.000 --> 36:30.900
Hey.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.300
Sintodromes, disgusting.

36:36.300 --> 36:37.900
We have little time Dr. P.

36:37.900 --> 36:38.200
Ronald!

36:38.200 --> 36:39.900
What is it?

36:39.900 --> 36:41.800
Be careful.

36:49.300 --> 36:53.300
Ron, stop wasting time.

36:58.200 --> 37:02.200
Thank you, Rufus.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Kim!

37:27.600 --> 37:29.100
Father, are you okay?

37:29.100 --> 37:31.000
Yes, at least I think so.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.100
What is the Drakken made you exactly?

37:33.100 --> 37:35.200
I. .. I do not know.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.000
He caught up in your lab, right?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.500
Captured? I do not remember.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.800
I remember to ask for bacon on pizza,

37:41.800 --> 37:43.200
and after that, nothing.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.200
Come on, Dad will put you at home.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.300
Which is where?

37:47.300 --> 37:48.600
(Banana Club)

37:48.600 --> 37:50.300
You saved your father?

37:50.300 --> 37:51.800
It is a drama, Monique

37:51.800 --> 37:53.000
You know what this means,

37:53.000 --> 37:54.300
You have a "continue".

37:54.300 --> 37:55.000
I?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.300
Yes, you'll never be punished girl.

37:57.300 --> 38:00.200
So why is the type
Bad kidnapped your father?

38:00.200 --> 38:01.600
To catch me, I think.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.600
Something strange happened, usually with
spoil the secret conspiracies Drakken.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.700
This time was also random.

38:08.700 --> 38:12.700
I want something that says:
"This kid is too good for you"

38:12.800 --> 38:15.200
Do you think you should take it?

38:15.200 --> 38:17.600
Get him, and throws him out, urgh ....

38:17.600 --> 38:19.900
Perhaps you should peruse my closet.

38:19.900 --> 38:20.900
Not for the ball.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.400
You will be Kimderela.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.500
Kim, hi.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.600

38:33.800 --> 38:35.200
Have you met Ron Stoppable?

38:35.200 --> 38:37.400

39:18.800 --> 39:21.400
You still did not get

39:21.400 --> 39:23.900
There is no plan here,
any way.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.300
Ah, but there!

39:26.300 --> 39:27.900

39:27.900 --> 39:29.200
No!

39:29.200 --> 39:30.800
Why not?

39:30.800 --> 39:34.800
The Kim Possible is not smarter than you.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.600
Truth.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.000
And if you find you can not,

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000

discover, and that means ...

39:43.100 --> 39:45.000
You can win!

39:45.000 --> 39:47.800
Oh, I'm pretty confident!

39:47.800 --> 39:51.000
Now, if I apologize, I have a
meeting with the board of directors.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.300
You? What company?

39:53.300 --> 39:57.300
One that just
acquire a fierce competition.

40:02.800 --> 40:06.800
This is my character!

40:09.700 --> 40:13.700
This is my character!

40:26.100 --> 40:30.100
I'm here in Bueno Nacho, the home of
Little Diablo ", this little toy,

40:30.400 --> 40:36.800
this mini "I have", this
dear little devil is the last
creation for kids around the world.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.800
Only with a look give
to see that the "Little Diablo" is ...

40:39.800 --> 40:42.200
I can not even get to the counter to order.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.600
This is usually my site. MY!

40:44.600 --> 40:48.600
I'm losing
everything I have ever cared.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.900
The Ron is on TV!

40:49.900 --> 40:52.000
And it's happening!

40:52.000 --> 40:54.100
Honey, I think

Please.

41:02.500 --> 41:06.500
I'm losing
everything I have ever cared.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.200
You better go talk to him.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.600
He is the old tree house.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.500
(girls are not allowed)

41:19.800 --> 41:21.300
I have a lethal weapon.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.900
Put the grains, Huck Finn, I am.

41:23.900 --> 41:27.100
Ah, always wanted to use it on someone.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.200
And you used once, remember?

41:29.200 --> 41:30.000
Arny Kuster?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.100
Arny Kuster.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.100
I was just trying to stop him from hurting you.

41:33.100 --> 41:36.700
I had to separate from you for
teres hit him with the slingshot.

41:36.700 --> 41:40.700
We had six, the details fail me.

41:41.100 --> 41:42.900
I had never noticed that sign before.

41:42.900 --> 41:46.900
Seriously Is there ever since.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.600
Ah, it was fun.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.400
I mean, when we were kids.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.500
Yes, just the two of us.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.900
Hey, I remember this.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.500
Ron, the happy camper.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.600
Field "Wannaweep.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.900
The worst summer of my life.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.900
I know, I know ... the ticks, poison ivy, the toxic lake,

42:04.900 --> 42:06.700
your mother left to attend to your calls.

42:06.700 --> 42:10.100
Yes, you know, all that was bad, KP,

42:10.100 --> 42:11.800
but you know what was worse?

42:11.800 --> 42:15.800
Spending the whole summer away from you.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.900
Want some? Now only do orders.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.800
The "Little Diablos" messed up.

42:20.800 --> 42:24.800
Maybe something beyond
Bueno Nacho 's bothering you.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.300
Are you talking about Eric ?...,

42:27.300 --> 42:31.300
No, because it has an
problem with Eric? No. ..

42:32.200 --> 42:35.100
I'm cool with Eric.

42:35.100 --> 42:38.600
Ron, Eric does
will change our relationship.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.200
We will always be close.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.100
Yes, beautiful words Kim.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.100
We are no longer in pre-primary,

42:44.100 --> 42:45.400
it is time to grow.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.500
Maybe I do not want to grow, if that means ...

42:47.500 --> 42:50.400
Kim

42:50.400 --> 42:51.900
He can not climb.

42:51.900 --> 42:52.700
Ron

42:52.700 --> 42:56.200
No, seriously he can not climb,
This treehouse has a weight limit,

42:56.200 --> 42:59.800
and to be holding this
gaff I am actually overcome.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.800
We talk tomorrow!

43:05.300 --> 43:08.100
I'm not jealous.

Can I ask you something?

43:18.000 --> 43:18.800

43:23.200 --> 43:24.100
Weird?

43:24.100 --> 43:25.900

I mean, hey, that was me
she called as she and Walter
were arrested with the apparatus.

43:45.100 --> 43:48.100
It was my mother who took her to the orthodontist.

43:48.100 --> 43:52.100
Ah, I can not ...

43:52.400 --> 43:53.900
And the whole scene of Josh Mankey,

43:53.900 --> 43:55.800
never been in favor of it,

43:55.800 --> 43:59.200
but was there to support Kim.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.700
Yes, very funny.

44:00.700 --> 44:02.000
Ok, ok.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.200
There is something different now.

44:03.200 --> 44:06.700
There's something between us, who I
I make a mistake, is no different,

44:06.700 --> 44:09.100
something was always there.

44:09.100 --> 44:13.100
I think there is something there, and it?

44:13.800 --> 44:15.000
Ah, thanks mate.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
I think I'm prepared

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
and not only for the ball, but
do something that no man should
fazer, falar dos seus sentimentos.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.200
I know it's humiliating,

44:24.200 --> 44:25.900
Kim but worth it.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.900
But what if she really likes this Eric,
and I appear to speak of my feelings,

44:30.400 --> 44:31.600
and she wants to Eric, and I do not want me.

44:31.600 --> 44:35.300
We are talking about Total Humiliation.

44:35.300 --> 44:39.300
Oh, not to mention how
would affect our friendship.

44:44.800 --> 44:48.400
Kimmie, here's a boy
very good looking for you.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.500
Let's have some things clarified.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.200
Ah, you read my mind, sir

44:52.200 --> 44:54.600
Kim explained to me that the normal hours are ten,

44:54.600 --> 44:58.100
but on special occasions and
missions you increase this limit.

44:58.100 --> 45:00.000
I feel better if
we keep the ten-hours.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
Oh, really? This young man has a "continue".

45:04.400 --> 45:06.100
Why do not you check the machine, baby.

45:06.100 --> 45:07.100
Ok

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Imbeciles!

45:28.000 --> 45:28.800
Ah, good reflexes.

45:28.800 --> 45:29.600
Thank you, sir.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.900
It's just me, or he's really perfect?

45:31.900 --> 45:35.900
He seems very nice.

45:39.100 --> 45:41.500
Your parents will not go
around here, to take photos.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.400
I just got my father, and
it is always

45:43.400 --> 45:46.100
working, as now, where
're in a super project.

45:46.100 --> 45:47.700
Oh, I know this story.

45:47.700 --> 45:50.000
Hey, does not matter, I make two copies.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Cool.

46:18.300 --> 46:20.600
The Kim Possible and the new guy have the pace.

46:20.600 --> 46:21.700
Oh, shut up!

46:21.700 --> 46:25.700
Ok

46:32.200 --> 46:33.500

46:33.500 --> 46:34.900

Rufus can not wait.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.000
Why, just because I care?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.700
With folds of the straws.

47:55.700 --> 47:56.700
