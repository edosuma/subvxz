WEBVTT

00:14.791 --> 00:16.125
Come on!

00:16.208 --> 00:20.375
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.458 --> 00:23.916
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:24.833
All right!

00:24.916 --> 00:27.041
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:30.625
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.083
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:36.333
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.750
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.833 --> 00:39.833
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.916 --> 00:45.208
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.291 --> 00:47.208
<i>Maths Party!</i>

01:04.833 --> 01:06.125
It can't be!

01:06.833 --> 01:08.875
Oh no!

01:10.208 --> 01:12.500
Pandazilla!

01:25.583 --> 01:30.250
Pandazilla knocked down the tower!

01:31.583 --> 01:33.541
Yay!

01:37.375 --> 01:39.666
Tilly, are you okay?

01:41.791 --> 01:45.333
Don't worry, Tilly.
Lulu's just pretending.

01:45.416 --> 01:48.666
Yeah. She's not really Pandazilla.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.458
Nope. I'm just Lulu.

01:51.541 --> 01:54.166
Knocking down blocks is fun.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.416
Come and try. Come on.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.041
Yeah.

02:00.791 --> 02:03.291
Here you go. Kick it.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.333
Tilly really likes this game.

02:16.416 --> 02:17.500
Yeah.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.541
Oh no!

02:26.625 --> 02:29.583
Everybody run!

02:29.666 --> 02:33.041
It's the Terrific Tortoise!

02:38.291 --> 02:41.458
Pandazilla strikes again!

02:41.541 --> 02:42.375
Lulu…

02:42.958 --> 02:43.791
Yay!

02:45.625 --> 02:47.083
-Uh-oh.
-Yay?

02:47.166 --> 02:50.583
I think Tilly wanted
to knock down her tower.

02:50.666 --> 02:52.666
But <i>I'm</i> Pandazilla.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.166
<i>Bù!</i>

02:57.750 --> 03:01.666
Hey, I know. Let's build two towers.

03:01.750 --> 03:04.583
One for Tilly and one for Lulu!

03:04.666 --> 03:06.625
Good idea!

03:06.708 --> 03:07.791
<i>Shì!</i>

03:07.875 --> 03:13.166
You can use those blocks, and I'll use…

03:13.833 --> 03:15.416
Are there more blocks?

03:15.500 --> 03:17.250
Maybe in the toy chest!

03:17.333 --> 03:18.833
Oh yeah!

03:21.708 --> 03:24.375
Not that. Not that.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.375
Found some!

03:27.791 --> 03:31.166
There's lots of different-shaped blocks.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.458
Well, what shape do you want to use?

03:34.541 --> 03:36.250
I don't know.

03:36.333 --> 03:40.166
I know what will help you decide.
Let's shape it!

03:40.250 --> 03:42.416
Great idea. Let's go!

03:42.500 --> 03:44.625
Yeah! Sing!

03:44.708 --> 03:48.000
-Yeah!
-Come on, Terrific Tortoise!

03:50.625 --> 03:52.750
<i>Shape it, shape it, shape it</i>

03:53.791 --> 03:56.208
<i>No corners, round and smooth</i>

03:56.291 --> 03:58.708
<i>That's a circle, let's all move</i>

03:58.791 --> 04:01.833
<i>Three straight sides with three angles</i>

04:01.916 --> 04:04.666
<i>-One, two, three</i>
<i>-A triangle</i>

04:04.750 --> 04:07.583
<i>Four straight sides, all equal there</i>

04:07.666 --> 04:10.375
<i>Let's all jump into a square</i>

04:10.458 --> 04:13.125
<i>Four sides, all right angles</i>

04:13.208 --> 04:15.833
<i>Two sides longer, a rectangle</i>

04:15.916 --> 04:21.541
<i>Triangle, circle, that's a square</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, everywhere</i>

04:22.041 --> 04:24.375
<i>Eight sides, what's going on?</i>

04:24.458 --> 04:27.250
<i>Shape it, shape it, an octagon</i>

04:27.333 --> 04:32.916
<i>Triangle, circle, that's a square</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, everywhere</i>

04:33.000 --> 04:39.583
<i>We've done great, we've gone far</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, we earned a star</i>

04:41.958 --> 04:44.166
Thank you, Stickety Bot!

04:46.625 --> 04:50.333
I want to use square blocks for my tower.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.625
Those will be easy to stack.

04:54.750 --> 04:59.083
Okay, Tilly. It's building time.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.416
Ta-da!

05:28.500 --> 05:29.750
Wow!

05:32.750 --> 05:34.458
What's wrong, Lulu?

05:35.583 --> 05:39.791
Tilly's tower has more blocks than mine.

05:40.666 --> 05:45.583
Tilly's tower is higher,
but I don't think she has more blocks.

05:45.666 --> 05:46.875
Yes, she does!

05:46.958 --> 05:48.875
That's why it's higher!

06:01.250 --> 06:04.750
Well, let's not fight.
It's not nice to fight.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.833
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:08.875 --> 06:11.000
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:12.166 --> 06:14.250
<i>It's not right</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:17.375
<i>So let's not fight</i>

06:18.208 --> 06:24.750
<i>Like the time you took my bouncy ball</i>
<i>And threw it hard on the kitchen wall</i>

06:24.833 --> 06:27.750
<i>But then you pushed me and made me fall</i>

06:27.833 --> 06:29.291
-I didn't do that.
-Yes, you did.

06:29.375 --> 06:30.833
-Did not!
-Did too!

06:30.916 --> 06:32.041
-Did not!
-Did!

06:32.125 --> 06:34.500
-No, I…
-You guys are fighting.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.958
-Oops.
-Sorry, Lulu.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.041
Sorry, Kippie.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.750
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:40.958 --> 06:42.958
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:44.041 --> 06:49.375
<i>It feels so right</i>
<i>When we don't fight, so let's not fight</i>

06:50.541 --> 06:52.583
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:53.750 --> 06:57.666
Tilly, I'm sorry. I don't want to fight.

06:58.708 --> 07:03.500
I was just cross
that Tilly has more blocks.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.625
Lulu, I really don't think she does.

07:07.708 --> 07:10.583
But then why is her tower higher?

07:11.083 --> 07:14.500
Could this be a maths problem?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
Yes!

07:17.083 --> 07:20.166
Maths Molly!

07:23.583 --> 07:25.458
-There she is!
-There she goes!

07:27.041 --> 07:28.208
Wait for us!

07:33.041 --> 07:36.083
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:36.166 --> 07:38.833
-Come on, Tilly.
-Come on!

07:40.000 --> 07:44.708
I need to know
which tower has more blocks.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.333
Well, that's Tilly's.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.291
How many blocks does she have?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.291
<i>One, two, three,</i>

07:57.375 --> 07:58.708
<i>four, five.</i>

07:59.208 --> 08:00.208
Five!

08:03.666 --> 08:05.416
That's my tower!

08:05.500 --> 08:07.041
How many blocks?

08:08.916 --> 08:11.458
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six,</i>

08:11.541 --> 08:13.250
<i>seven, eight, nine, ten.</i>

08:13.333 --> 08:14.541
Ten?

08:15.041 --> 08:21.291
I have more blocks?
But then why is Tilly's tower higher?

08:21.375 --> 08:26.166
<i>Babies, to answer this question,</i>
<i>you need to compare the blocks.</i>

08:26.250 --> 08:27.708
Compare?

08:27.791 --> 08:32.500
<i>Yes. Comparing is when you look closely</i>
<i>to see how things are different.</i>

08:33.125 --> 08:36.083
Well, let's compare blocks.

08:42.083 --> 08:42.916
Lulu!

08:43.000 --> 08:46.875
Tilly's blocks are bigger than yours!

08:48.250 --> 08:50.791
That's why her tower is higher!

08:50.875 --> 08:56.458
So, her blocks are bigger,
but I have more blocks.

08:57.541 --> 08:59.208
That's fair.

08:59.291 --> 09:03.333
And both towers will be fun to knock down.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.291
Let's knock them down!

09:09.875 --> 09:12.833
Not so fast, Pandazilla.

09:12.916 --> 09:15.125
First, we need a…

09:16.041 --> 09:19.708
-Maths Party!
-Yeah!

09:21.208 --> 09:22.625
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:22.708 --> 09:24.125
<i>We did math</i>s

09:24.208 --> 09:26.291
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:27.208 --> 09:30.125
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

09:30.208 --> 09:33.583
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

09:33.666 --> 09:34.500
Yeah!

09:34.583 --> 09:36.208
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:36.291 --> 09:37.625
<i>We did maths</i>

09:37.708 --> 09:40.125
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:40.625 --> 09:43.291
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:43.375 --> 09:48.125
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:48.208 --> 09:50.750
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:51.333 --> 09:53.875
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:56.833 --> 10:02.000
In a world
where giant babies miss their naps

10:02.666 --> 10:06.666
and other giant babies
haven't had their snacks,

10:06.750 --> 10:09.375
watch out for the tantrums of

10:09.458 --> 10:14.250
Pandazilla and the Terrific Tortoise!

10:20.500 --> 10:24.083
-There they go.
-Oh boy!

10:28.333 --> 10:30.708
Big or small,

10:30.791 --> 10:34.750
your tower will fall.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.416
Look. Look at all those.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.041
My tower really did have more blocks.

10:46.791 --> 10:48.875
Should we set them up again?

10:49.916 --> 10:55.583
Let's use all the blocks
to build one super-duper tower

10:56.166 --> 10:57.791
just for Tilly.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.083
Stickety Bot!

11:11.791 --> 11:15.666
<i>Lulu did a great job</i>
<i>including Tilly in her game today,</i>

11:15.750 --> 11:17.750
<i>so she's getting a sticker.</i>

11:23.000 --> 11:24.916
Thanks, Stickety Bot.

11:26.291 --> 11:29.125
-Bye-bye!
-Bye!

11:29.791 --> 11:33.333
Come on, Pandazilla!
Let's go build that tower!

11:33.416 --> 11:34.875
-Coming!
-Oh boy!

11:35.416 --> 11:40.041
I want to give <i>you</i> my sticker.
Because you helped me compare.

11:40.541 --> 11:41.958
This is for you.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.166
Bye-bye-bye.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.208
Let's build your tower! Come on!

12:00.875 --> 12:03.666
-Let's pretend we're holding microphones.
-Okay.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.916
<i>The babies are playing sports</i>
<i>in the playroom today.</i>

12:07.000 --> 12:11.708
It's a great day for Hoop Rolling!

12:11.791 --> 12:14.666
Not a cloud in the playroom.

12:15.541 --> 12:20.208
Super all-star Tilly gets ready
as the crowd goes wild!

12:20.291 --> 12:23.208
-Go, Tilly!
-You can do it.

12:23.291 --> 12:27.041
Here she goes. She's lining up the shot…

12:27.750 --> 12:28.958
And…

12:30.583 --> 12:32.875
Yay!

12:35.291 --> 12:39.583
She did it! A new playroom record!

12:40.625 --> 12:41.625
My turn.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.833
It's my turn.

12:44.833 --> 12:47.166
It's my turn. I was next.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.458
Maybe we can play together.

12:50.541 --> 12:54.291
But this is a one-baby game.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.916
Well, we need a game for more babies.
One we can all play.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.333
The What's It Toy!

13:04.416 --> 13:08.916
What's It always has
what you need when you need it!

13:10.041 --> 13:13.916
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

13:14.000 --> 13:18.083
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know, and how</i>

13:18.166 --> 13:21.458
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know right now!</i>

13:21.541 --> 13:22.583
<i>-Does it swirl?</i>
<i>-Does it splurt?</i>

13:22.666 --> 13:23.541
<i>-Does it twiddle?</i>
<i>-Does it blink?</i>

13:23.625 --> 13:24.500
<i>-Is it rough?</i>
<i>-Is it smooth?</i>

13:24.583 --> 13:25.416
<i>-Is it brown?</i>
<i>-Is it pink?</i>

13:25.500 --> 13:26.416
<i>-Is it cold?</i>
<i>-Is it cuddly?</i>

13:26.500 --> 13:27.458
<i>-Is it nice?</i>
<i>-Is it mean?</i>

13:27.541 --> 13:31.208
<i>Is it something in-between?</i>
<i>Something like I've never seen?</i>

13:31.291 --> 13:34.916
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

13:35.000 --> 13:38.583
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

13:38.666 --> 13:41.875
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know, and how</i>

13:41.958 --> 13:44.000
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

13:44.083 --> 13:46.916
<i>I want to know, I want to know</i>
<i>I want to know right now!</i>

13:47.000 --> 13:47.833
<i>Right now!</i>

14:00.916 --> 14:03.041
-A ball!
-Yeah!

14:03.125 --> 14:05.875
Well, lots of babies can play with a ball.

14:05.958 --> 14:07.875
-Yeah.
-Thank you, What's It Toy!

14:07.958 --> 14:09.666
-Bye-bye!
-Bye!

14:09.750 --> 14:14.625
<i>Babies, there's more to this game.</i>
<i>A surprise on the playground!</i>

14:15.208 --> 14:16.666
A surprise?

14:22.541 --> 14:23.541
There it is!

14:25.375 --> 14:27.500
Wow! Hey, what is that for?

14:27.583 --> 14:30.916
I know. It's for baby b-ball.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.000
Baby b-ball?

14:33.083 --> 14:36.000
Yeah. It's a game for lots of babies.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.125
I'll show you.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.500
You put the ball in the hoop…

14:44.458 --> 14:46.916
And you win!

14:47.791 --> 14:50.208
-This will be fun.
-Cool! Okay.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.875
I win! Kip is the b-ball champion!

15:00.166 --> 15:01.000
Tilly gets it.

15:04.916 --> 15:08.000
But, Kip, we didn't start the game yet.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.875
Oops. Sorry.

15:12.833 --> 15:18.916
First, we have to split up into two teams
and pick our team colours.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.125
There's a lot of pretty colours.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.666
There are so many to choose from.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.708
Big kids, would you help us pick?

15:31.750 --> 15:34.750
<i>What's your favourite colour?</i>
<i>I'm asking you</i>

15:34.833 --> 15:38.291
<i>Clap two times</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's blue</i>

15:39.375 --> 15:40.375
<i>Blue!</i>

15:40.458 --> 15:43.666
<i>What's the nicest colour you've ever seen?</i>

15:43.750 --> 15:47.333
<i>Clap and dance</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's green</i>

15:48.333 --> 15:49.166
<i>Green!</i>

15:49.708 --> 15:52.750
<i>Do you like to clap?</i>
<i>I thought that's what you said</i>

15:52.833 --> 15:56.333
<i>Clap and dance</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's red</i>

15:57.291 --> 15:58.208
<i>Red!</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:01.541
<i>The colours of the rainbow</i>

16:01.625 --> 16:07.750
<i>-Are all so beautiful to me</i>
<i>-The colours of the rainbow</i>

16:07.833 --> 16:12.208
<i>Are so beautiful to see</i>

16:12.291 --> 16:13.291
<i>Colours!</i>

16:13.875 --> 16:14.708
<i>Colours!</i>

16:15.333 --> 16:16.166
<i>Colours!</i>

16:16.791 --> 16:17.625
<i>Colours!</i>

16:17.708 --> 16:18.791
Yeah!

16:18.875 --> 16:20.708
We pick red.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.500
-Yeah.
-Red Team!

16:22.583 --> 16:27.416
-The bestest team in the world!
-Yeah!

16:27.500 --> 16:31.083
Wobble like a butterfly,
hop like a wallaby!

16:33.041 --> 16:35.125
We pick blue.

16:35.208 --> 16:40.416
You can't beat the blue team.
Because I have cheetah speed!

16:41.375 --> 16:43.166
And I…

16:44.416 --> 16:46.666
I just want everyone to have fun.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.500
<i>Blue Team.</i>

16:50.000 --> 16:50.958
<i>Bailey.</i>

16:52.333 --> 16:53.208
<i>Tilly.</i>

16:54.125 --> 16:55.125
<i>Franny.</i>

16:57.666 --> 16:59.291
<i>Blue Team.</i>

16:59.375 --> 17:00.875
<i>Red Team.</i>

17:02.041 --> 17:02.875
<i>Lulu.</i>

17:04.208 --> 17:05.125
<i>Kip.</i>

17:05.875 --> 17:07.416
<i>Red Team.</i>

17:07.500 --> 17:09.541
<i>Baby b-ball.</i>

17:12.041 --> 17:15.000
One, two, three, go!

17:23.833 --> 17:25.083
Come on, Tilly!

17:28.625 --> 17:31.666
Bail-Bail, you and Tilly are in my way.

17:33.083 --> 17:36.625
Well, sorry, Lulu.
I was just playing the game.

17:37.791 --> 17:38.750
Lulu!

17:39.625 --> 17:41.583
Pass it to me!

17:43.333 --> 17:44.625
Lulu! Okay, now!

17:45.500 --> 17:46.333
Okay!

17:50.166 --> 17:51.333
Skidoosh!

17:52.416 --> 17:53.791
Oh no.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.125
Blue Team wins!

18:00.666 --> 18:04.291
-Red Team lost?
-And the blue team won?

18:04.375 --> 18:06.791
And they're doing my dance?!

18:07.541 --> 18:10.125
Something's wrong with these teams.

18:10.708 --> 18:14.166
Lulu, I think you're just mad
'cause you didn't win.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.708
No. Stand in line. Lulu wants to see.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.916
Okay, Lulu.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.208
Look! The blue team has more players.

18:24.291 --> 18:27.833
-Yeah! You're right. That's not fair.
-Yeah.

18:29.583 --> 18:33.625
-Oh yeah. We do have more players.
-Yeah.

18:34.333 --> 18:37.625
Okay, well, I'll go on the red team, then.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.875
-Okay. Hi.
-Hi.

18:45.416 --> 18:49.583
Wait! Now the red team has more!

18:50.250 --> 18:52.208
Lulu, you come over here.

18:52.833 --> 18:53.791
Okay!

18:53.875 --> 18:56.125
-Bye, Lulu.
-Bye.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.041
Now you have more again.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.833
Let's keep trying.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.458
I don't think this is right.

19:27.958 --> 19:28.958
Tilly.

19:29.625 --> 19:34.000
Well, how do we get the same number
of players on both teams

19:34.083 --> 19:35.416
so that it's fair?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.250
"Same number"!

19:38.625 --> 19:41.625
This is a maths problem! We need…

19:42.208 --> 19:46.250
Maths Molly!

19:52.000 --> 19:55.125
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

19:55.208 --> 19:59.833
The red and blue teams
need the same number of players.

19:59.916 --> 20:03.833
First, we should compare by counting.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.708
Those are not the same.

20:11.833 --> 20:15.333
Well, how many players
are on the blue team, big kids?

20:16.791 --> 20:20.250
<i>One, two, three.</i>

20:21.500 --> 20:23.708
How many players are on the red team?

20:25.791 --> 20:27.666
<i>One, two.</i>

20:28.958 --> 20:31.583
The red team only has two.

20:31.666 --> 20:36.166
The red team needs the same number
as the blue team.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.708
How many players do they need, big kids?

20:43.125 --> 20:44.125
<i>Three.</i>

20:46.916 --> 20:50.166
We need one more player!

20:50.250 --> 20:54.541
But where do we find
another player for the red team?

20:54.625 --> 20:57.666
I know! And he's already red!

20:57.750 --> 20:59.916
Party-in-a-box!

21:03.708 --> 21:05.375
The teams are the same,

21:05.458 --> 21:06.500
so let's play!

21:06.583 --> 21:08.416
Oh wait! Wait! Kippie!

21:08.500 --> 21:10.583
We need a…

21:11.166 --> 21:14.125
Maths Party!

21:16.166 --> 21:17.583
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

21:17.666 --> 21:19.083
<i>We did math</i>s

21:19.166 --> 21:21.250
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

21:22.166 --> 21:25.083
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

21:25.166 --> 21:28.541
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

21:28.625 --> 21:29.458
Yeah!

21:29.541 --> 21:31.166
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

21:31.250 --> 21:32.583
<i>We did maths</i>

21:32.666 --> 21:35.083
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

21:35.583 --> 21:38.250
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

21:38.333 --> 21:43.083
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

21:43.166 --> 21:45.708
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

21:46.291 --> 21:48.875
<i>We love maths!</i>

21:50.250 --> 21:51.416
<i>Blue Team.</i>

21:52.958 --> 21:54.458
<i>Red Team.</i>

21:54.958 --> 21:56.250
<i>Baby b-ball.</i>

22:03.666 --> 22:07.041
Lulu! Over here! Pass it to me!

22:08.541 --> 22:09.458
Lulu?

22:09.541 --> 22:11.791
-I'm open!
-Okay!

22:12.375 --> 22:13.208
I'm open!

22:13.958 --> 22:15.208
I'm not open.

22:15.291 --> 22:16.791
What do I do?

22:17.625 --> 22:19.458
Pass it to Party!

22:19.541 --> 22:20.541
Okay!

22:25.250 --> 22:26.666
<i>Party-in-a-box.</i>

22:26.750 --> 22:28.541
Well done!

22:36.416 --> 22:39.875
-Red Team wins!
-Yay!

22:39.958 --> 22:43.291
Good game, Red Team.
Hey, let's play again.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.916
-Yes, please!
-Oh yeah!

22:46.333 --> 22:47.666
We should play again.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.541
Thanks for making the teams
the same, big kids.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.291
-Lulu! We need you!
-Oh okay!

22:56.000 --> 22:59.291
-Got to play. Bye-bye-bye.
-Bye, big kids.
