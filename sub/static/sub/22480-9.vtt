WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.921
Stinger missiles.

00:01.956 --> 00:03.306
Get up!

00:03.342 --> 00:04.730
I shot Idrisi twice.

00:04.766 --> 00:06.233
How did you survive that?

00:06.269 --> 00:07.033
Where is he?

00:07.069 --> 00:09.318
I know who is in the black
sites, but not where they are!

00:09.354 --> 00:10.914
We outsource the setups.

00:11.952 --> 00:12.880
Open the door!

00:12.916 --> 00:15.166
Aren't you guys sick
of us saving your asses?

00:16.157 --> 00:17.761
Now we need to talk about Idrisi.

00:17.828 --> 00:19.872
We're gonna take him with us, Colonel.

00:20.586 --> 00:22.293
I've been chasing the
ghosts in the machine.

00:22.317 --> 00:23.842
I told you to leave it for now.

00:24.660 --> 00:26.681
I've got no choice, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:33.806 --> 00:35.179
Grenade!

00:45.757 --> 00:46.934
Go, go, go!

00:47.469 --> 00:49.232
They're blocking all exits.

00:59.158 --> 01:00.239
Move!

01:00.423 --> 01:01.423
Moving!

01:02.472 --> 01:03.584
Moving!

01:05.045 --> 01:07.091
What did I say about taking the freeway?

01:07.169 --> 01:09.644
Seriously? You're doing that? Right now?

01:09.680 --> 01:11.634
Go! Gotta move. Go, go, go.

01:11.794 --> 01:12.794
Go.

01:18.322 --> 01:19.322
Moving!

01:25.878 --> 01:27.196
Who are these guys?

01:27.275 --> 01:28.798
Feel free to ask them, mate!

01:31.421 --> 01:33.764
I don't know if this guy's
worth dying for, though.

01:33.896 --> 01:36.340
They will not stop until they have me.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.670
Maybe we should give
them what they want, then.

01:41.277 --> 01:42.609
Hold your fire!

01:47.845 --> 01:51.260
This is who you want,
right? You can have him.

01:52.234 --> 01:56.819
Lower your weapons. I
said, lower your weapons!

01:56.885 --> 01:58.445
Baissez vos armes, faites ce qu'il dit.

01:58.781 --> 02:00.860
Guns down, ho, ho.

02:03.885 --> 02:04.902
Down.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.664
There, you can have him, I'm walking away.

02:26.445 --> 02:27.493
Move! Move!

02:27.832 --> 02:28.832
Moving!

02:36.791 --> 02:37.791
Shit!

02:38.933 --> 02:39.933
Shit!

02:41.645 --> 02:46.412
Hey! Captain! Captain!
What the hell are you doing?

02:49.301 --> 02:50.858
Get down! Get down!

02:51.525 --> 02:52.525
Stay down!

02:55.645 --> 02:57.109
Reynolds just fucked off with Idrisi!

02:57.133 --> 02:58.648
Why the hell would she do that?

02:58.707 --> 02:59.827
Fuck knows, mate!

03:02.445 --> 03:04.082
We're gonna need another exfil.

03:05.224 --> 03:06.291
Grenade!

03:06.362 --> 03:07.681
C'mon, move!

03:18.507 --> 03:19.507
Clear.

03:20.245 --> 03:21.577
Got wheels, over here.

03:22.525 --> 03:23.957
Get in, let's get after her.

04:00.106 --> 04:05.106
Subtitles by explosiveskull.

04:54.725 --> 04:55.837
You're dead.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.125
Nicely done.

04:59.688 --> 05:00.688
No.

05:02.765 --> 05:04.374
No, I let you get the drop on me.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.520
And then, you recovered.
Turned it to your advantage.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.022
Eighteen months ago,
you would have crumbled.

05:10.046 --> 05:12.556
Yeah, well, eighteen months ago, I
didn't know a muzzle from a magazine.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.744
Come on, please, let's do it again.

05:13.768 --> 05:17.168
Jane. You're ready.

05:17.845 --> 05:21.930
Really? Have they given us
the green light?

05:23.045 --> 05:24.523
Omair Idrisi.

05:25.293 --> 05:27.992
Get close to him. Gain his trust.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.631
Get us what we need to take
him and his organisation down.

05:32.561 --> 05:34.726
You really believe that's possible?

05:34.843 --> 05:39.205
I have never seen anyone with such
natural talent, the ability to adapt.

05:39.286 --> 05:42.074
Believe me... one person
can make all the difference.

05:45.565 --> 05:49.601
Right. And what... And what
happens if it all goes wrong?

05:50.646 --> 05:56.260
And if... when... if he finds out
that I'm not... wh... what I say I am?

05:56.325 --> 06:01.445
If anything happens, I'll be
there, to get you out. I promise.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.241
OK.

06:08.541 --> 06:09.744
OK.

06:16.078 --> 06:17.358
I have him.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.422
Bring him to the rendezvous
point. And the rest of the team?

06:21.478 --> 06:24.090
Well, I left them behind,
Colonel, just like you said.

06:24.131 --> 06:25.775
I know you've got doubts.

06:26.366 --> 06:28.110
But there was an attack on the crib.

06:28.146 --> 06:31.329
And until I'm sure everyone is clean,
you're the only one I can trust.

06:32.879 --> 06:35.943
You should know... You should
know, there was an ambush

06:36.006 --> 06:37.298
and I don't think it was Parker's men.

06:37.322 --> 06:39.701
So, you might want to get
Jensen to look into it.

06:39.764 --> 06:43.125
Natalie, Jensen didn't make it out.

06:45.260 --> 06:46.460
Fuck.

06:47.725 --> 06:48.771
I'm sorry.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.678
You understand now why
I asked you to do this?

06:51.985 --> 06:54.225
Stay on mission. Bring me Idrisi.

06:56.196 --> 06:57.306
Copy.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.211
Bloody hell!

07:06.866 --> 07:08.563
Reynolds just snatched
Idrisi and took off on us.

07:08.587 --> 07:10.307
I don't think she's gonna
answer the phone.

07:10.445 --> 07:12.329
No, I'm trying to get
in touch with Jensen.

07:12.419 --> 07:14.386
He tracks our phones,
he can get a bead on her.

07:15.414 --> 07:19.281
Wait, he sent me an automated
link to his files, I might be able

07:19.317 --> 07:20.865
to access tracking through that.

07:21.652 --> 07:23.316
What the fuck?!

07:23.394 --> 07:26.425
The last files that Jensen logged,
that Project Tenebrae thing he was

07:26.472 --> 07:29.288
looking into, it's Donovan.

07:29.347 --> 07:30.458
And Lowry.

07:37.677 --> 07:39.206
Would you like to talk about it?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.259
No.

07:40.535 --> 07:44.314
You will deliver me to a person
you have lost faith in and you turn

07:44.350 --> 07:46.651
your back on the people you trust.

07:46.706 --> 07:47.581
Sure.

07:47.628 --> 07:50.108
I'm going to take life advice
from a man who blows up airliners

07:50.139 --> 07:51.296
and hotels.

08:05.094 --> 08:06.094
Fuck!

08:16.223 --> 08:17.347
Jesus.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.902
What the fuck are you doing?

08:27.885 --> 08:29.125
I'm joking.

08:30.909 --> 08:31.909
OK.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.972
What the hell were you
going to do with that?

08:48.685 --> 08:49.958
How did you find me?

08:50.333 --> 08:53.148
Jensen had a tracker on
your phone. You alright?

08:53.922 --> 08:55.122
I've been better.

08:55.264 --> 08:56.584
Just wanna talk, OK?

08:57.182 --> 08:58.250
Are you alone?

08:58.756 --> 08:59.649
Yeah, I'm alone.

08:59.685 --> 09:00.847
Mostly alone.

09:03.006 --> 09:04.118
Mostly alone.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.670
Hey, Captain.

09:11.324 --> 09:13.161
Put your hands behind your back, come on.

09:14.232 --> 09:16.657
You know, I'm getting
fucking sick of tying you up.

09:17.153 --> 09:19.085
I had orders from Donovan.

09:20.123 --> 09:22.223
Did you know Lowry was a British agent?

09:23.149 --> 09:24.149
What?

09:24.573 --> 09:25.453
No.

09:25.574 --> 09:28.363
Donovan trained her, it's
called Project Tenebrae.

09:28.439 --> 09:30.299
That's bullshit! She would have told us.

09:30.335 --> 09:31.102
Come on.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.102
Yeah. She should have told us.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.430
You don't think I don't know what this is,

09:35.461 --> 09:39.450
Your little setup. You lie to me.

09:39.536 --> 09:42.042
- Try to tricking me.
- Look at the photos, mate.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.579
I don't need to look at your photos, mate.

09:44.647 --> 09:45.647
I know my wife.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.405
Do you? Look at them!

09:49.398 --> 09:50.494
Look at them!

10:03.302 --> 10:06.467
This whole time, we've been
chasing a rogue fuckin' agent.

10:06.963 --> 10:09.363
Remember when Jensen asked
you for security clearance?

10:09.918 --> 10:12.362
This was the shit he was looking into.

10:12.485 --> 10:14.219
We need to get in touch with

10:14.255 --> 10:16.215
him and find out what else he knows.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.643
The crib was hit.

10:22.045 --> 10:23.045
And?

10:23.694 --> 10:26.974
Donovan said that Jensen
didn't make it, Gracie.

10:28.685 --> 10:31.833
Is that right? What, he's dead?

10:32.365 --> 10:33.641
Is that what you're saying?

10:33.961 --> 10:35.235
I'm sorry.

10:37.525 --> 10:41.291
Donovan lied to us about Lowry and
now you want me to believe this?

10:41.735 --> 10:43.464
It's fucking bullshit!

10:43.550 --> 10:46.024
Shit! Tangoes incoming. Shall
we sort this out in a bit?

10:46.094 --> 10:47.094
Is it bad?

10:47.485 --> 10:48.774
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

10:51.061 --> 10:52.862
- Go. Go! Move!
- Yeah.

10:56.207 --> 10:57.328
Incoming!

11:01.708 --> 11:03.716
OK. Let's go. Move! Move!

11:03.800 --> 11:04.859
Friends of yours?

11:04.895 --> 11:07.441
I don't have friends,
but you have many enemies.

11:07.477 --> 11:08.477
Fall back!

11:13.459 --> 11:14.459
In here.

11:19.694 --> 11:21.103
- Moving!
- Move!

11:22.397 --> 11:23.397
Move!

11:24.182 --> 11:26.364
We've got them pinned down!

11:28.189 --> 11:29.309
Move to the ship.

11:31.286 --> 11:32.638
- Get up there!
- More inbound.

11:32.674 --> 11:33.674
Fuck!

11:39.093 --> 11:40.213
Coming through!

11:42.517 --> 11:43.677
Move!

11:48.117 --> 11:49.117
Stay there!

11:49.714 --> 11:51.450
Keep them from grabbing Idrisi.

11:53.764 --> 11:56.804
Shit! Fuck, I'm out.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.208
Mac, they're coming from the bow.

11:59.313 --> 12:00.313
Moving.

12:01.591 --> 12:02.688
Changing!

12:02.724 --> 12:03.724
Novin!

12:11.994 --> 12:13.810
- Move!
- Move! Move!

12:14.238 --> 12:16.884
You're good, go, go! Go, go, go!

12:16.989 --> 12:17.989
Move!

12:18.213 --> 12:19.960
- Go there!
- Novin, no!

12:21.071 --> 12:22.401
Upstairs! Go!

12:24.788 --> 12:25.788
Stay there!

12:28.543 --> 12:30.639
They're still coming, keep it moving.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.663
You, with me, now!

12:40.489 --> 12:42.169
I'll go up, give us cover.

12:43.701 --> 12:45.140
I'm heading down the back.

13:02.632 --> 13:03.786
Hey. Hey!

13:05.071 --> 13:06.271
Drop your weapon.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.511
Fuck me!

13:56.833 --> 13:58.107
I'm moving!

14:03.587 --> 14:04.744
Easy, easy.

14:07.819 --> 14:08.819
Hey.

14:10.431 --> 14:11.431
Novin?

14:11.558 --> 14:12.759
I thought she was with you.

14:24.848 --> 14:32.848
So, anybody want to hear a
funny story? This is nice.

14:36.229 --> 14:39.727
Old friends, getting together.

14:40.870 --> 14:45.390
If the details of Tenebrae got out, it
would be uncomfortable but survivable.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.646
But where it would lead,
what we're accountable for,

15:00.533 --> 15:04.072
it would bring military
intelligence to its knees.

15:10.846 --> 15:14.585
I won't sacrifice all the good
we've done for one mistake.

15:14.621 --> 15:17.635
Ma'am, the team aren't aware of what
Lance Corporal Jensen discovered.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.337
As far as you know.

15:20.301 --> 15:22.080
I'm not taking the risk.

15:23.549 --> 15:26.233
You're asking me to eliminate my people?

15:26.785 --> 15:30.030
I'm saying that a clean
house is a good house.

15:30.319 --> 15:32.527
And to do what needs to be done.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.477
Captain Reynolds is bringing
me Idrisi. We'll use him as bait

15:35.559 --> 15:38.951
to draw Lowry out. I can
get this under control.

15:39.765 --> 15:42.340
We lost control a long time ago.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.967
I've given you those
Stillwater men for a reason.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.176
You have your orders.

15:47.744 --> 15:48.794
Yes, ma'am.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.793
Looks like you're having a bad day, too.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.363
We should do this

16:14.400 --> 16:15.791
more often.

16:15.885 --> 16:18.402
You don't write, you don't call.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.967
You just drop in, unexpectedly.

16:21.061 --> 16:29.061
You stole something from
me. Unfuckingbelievable.

16:32.018 --> 16:34.160
Your death was headline news.

16:34.239 --> 16:35.245
The hell you want with him?

16:35.269 --> 16:40.960
He belongs to me. Octagon Private
Security is one of my companies.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.993
We've been tracking you, assholes,
by satellite, ever since you

16:44.029 --> 16:45.285
broke out of my black site.

16:45.321 --> 16:46.969
Wait, and you didn't know they had him?

16:55.520 --> 17:03.520
Colonel Parker never said a
goddamn word. This is very exciting.

17:04.704 --> 17:08.405
How much do you think the Americans
would pay to keep this whole

17:08.462 --> 17:09.962
shitshow quiet?

17:12.394 --> 17:13.884
I have something better.

17:14.872 --> 17:20.210
Yeah, I very much doubt that.

17:20.680 --> 17:25.699
Jane told me she has a drive,
hidden away for our insurance.

17:26.692 --> 17:28.065
The Atlas.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.814
It's a list of every covert
op and agent sanctioned by

17:32.868 --> 17:35.108
British Military Intelligence.

17:39.045 --> 17:40.667
I just wanted to talk.

17:41.751 --> 17:42.839
You and me.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.074
Might be the last chance we'll
have to understand each other.

17:46.098 --> 17:49.826
No. Jane. Hundreds of people
are dead because of you.

17:50.747 --> 17:53.681
What is there that I could
possibly need to understand?

17:56.847 --> 17:59.800
You sanctioned a drone
strike against Idrisi.

18:00.005 --> 18:05.625
And when warned thatthat you had an asset
in the area, you said I was expendable.

18:06.977 --> 18:08.739
Direct quote.

18:11.161 --> 18:16.478
I saw the communiques. You
gave me access to the system.

18:16.541 --> 18:19.344
I revoked that access before
we put you in with Idrisi.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.882
You taught me how to
get around such things.

18:21.941 --> 18:24.551
You were a great teacher.
I'll give you that.

18:25.347 --> 18:28.591
Where do you see this
conversation ending, Jane?

18:29.080 --> 18:31.371
We hug, we agree to be friends?

18:31.407 --> 18:32.407
No.

18:33.069 --> 18:36.331
I'll be with Omair again.
And we'll disappear.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.457
And you'll leave us alone.

18:39.634 --> 18:41.304
That is not an option.

18:44.820 --> 18:48.361
Do you know what else I found when
I was combing through the system?

18:50.700 --> 18:52.214
I found the Atlas.

18:58.248 --> 19:01.269
Even if that's true,
you'd never release it.

19:01.628 --> 19:04.458
Because then, Idrisi would
know the truth about you.

19:05.716 --> 19:08.596
Or did you tell him you
were a British agent?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.604
Or about your life before that?

19:13.637 --> 19:14.988
You used me.

19:15.067 --> 19:18.484
Quite a life it was, as well; Petty
theft, violent assaults, addiction.

19:18.548 --> 19:19.699
And I wasn't the first, was I?

19:19.723 --> 19:22.752
Standing on street corners with your
your skirt hiked up, turning tricks.

19:22.824 --> 19:26.624
- How many people have you used and thrown away?
- How would your beloved husband react to that?

19:29.630 --> 19:31.267
Hiya. What can I get you?

19:32.030 --> 19:33.829
I'm fine, thanks. I'm not staying.

19:34.158 --> 19:35.598
Another coffee?

19:35.692 --> 19:37.211
No. This one was bad enough.

19:37.289 --> 19:39.610
I apologise. She has no manners.

19:39.673 --> 19:42.640
Try the coffee. And then,
tell me if I'm wrong.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.579
The mission comes first.

19:48.798 --> 19:51.065
The life of one person is
nothing compared to the many that

19:51.089 --> 19:52.929
we're fighting to protect.

19:58.452 --> 19:59.691
I'm sorry.

20:03.854 --> 20:07.505
You're not going to shoot
me in a public place, Adeena.

20:08.118 --> 20:09.398
I'm not here alone.

20:24.095 --> 20:25.587
The cleanup crew.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.414
I think we underestimated each other.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.842
Ives, come on, you can't
make a deal with him.

21:11.866 --> 21:13.680
He shot down your
helicopter for fuck's sake!

21:13.727 --> 21:16.124
Think about what this
means if the intel is real.

21:16.196 --> 21:20.119
Every British agent, every covert
op is gonna be blown wide open.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.777
Are you trying to get me hard?

21:22.840 --> 21:27.930
Info like that'll fetch eight
figures on the open market easy.

21:28.375 --> 21:29.853
Rainbow. Big pot of gold.

21:29.945 --> 21:32.764
Hey, hey, remember, we dragged
your ass out of Ajir. Remember?

21:32.820 --> 21:36.536
If it helps, think of this as
a character building moment.

21:36.593 --> 21:40.008
For me of course. You'll just drown.

21:41.816 --> 21:48.261
Should never have left
me in that fucking desert.

21:49.678 --> 21:51.307
Secure the weights.

21:54.806 --> 21:58.316
Make sure they sink like a stone.

22:16.045 --> 22:18.045
Let's get that deal in motion.

22:58.279 --> 22:59.279
Relax.

23:00.899 --> 23:03.626
Fuck! Did I just die? Did I just die?

23:03.691 --> 23:05.208
Well, yeah. You did
stop breathing for a bit.

23:05.232 --> 23:06.814
Wow!

23:06.891 --> 23:09.748
That was wild, that kinda
makes me want to do it again.

23:13.131 --> 23:15.604
Possible brain damage
due to lack of oxygen.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.132
Business as usual, then.

23:18.581 --> 23:20.221
- Ives?
- Gone.

23:20.746 --> 23:22.434
Luckily, Novin...

23:23.227 --> 23:23.967
You okay?

23:24.069 --> 23:27.364
Mate, I didn't bring you back from
the dead to ask me stupid questions.

23:27.443 --> 23:28.443
You're okay.

23:33.770 --> 23:36.414
We need to find out what resources
Ives has in the area, where

23:36.476 --> 23:37.596
he might have hidden Idrisi.

23:37.627 --> 23:39.735
Yeah. Think I've got that
covered for you. Come on.

23:40.494 --> 23:41.544
Course she has.

23:53.890 --> 23:54.890
Are you ready?

23:58.330 --> 24:01.548
Poor fella, got knocked over
the side of the ship with me.

24:02.330 --> 24:04.312
Before I saved your life, didn't I?

24:08.603 --> 24:12.939
You want to know something, matey?
We're having a pretty shitful day.

24:13.014 --> 24:20.349
Decent haul of kit, though, ammo,
binos. And Wyatt's favourite.

24:21.410 --> 24:22.974
C4, now you're talking.

24:23.632 --> 24:27.314
We've been lied to, shot at,
drowned, my knickers are wet

24:27.350 --> 24:28.552
and I'm bloody starving.

24:28.588 --> 24:30.770
If you don't tell us where
Morgan Ives was headed...

24:30.850 --> 24:33.213
Rovinj, it's a town on the coast.

24:33.249 --> 24:34.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on!

24:34.730 --> 24:36.286
Jesus. That was fast.

24:36.755 --> 24:39.687
Right, you get details.
We'll get vehicles.

24:39.723 --> 24:40.723
Copy that.

24:41.183 --> 24:43.430
This, fucking guy.

24:43.954 --> 24:45.745
I'm guessing you don't play poker, right?

24:51.437 --> 24:52.437
Fuck.

25:18.681 --> 25:22.016
Omair. Where are you?

25:22.757 --> 25:26.032
With our good friend, Morgan Ives.

25:26.068 --> 25:29.715
Jawedan, listen. You told me
once you stole something from the

25:29.761 --> 25:30.865
British.

25:31.615 --> 25:35.440
Intelligence that would one day
might be our insurance. You remember?

25:36.227 --> 25:37.818
Yes. Yes.

25:38.610 --> 25:39.996
The day is here.

25:40.450 --> 25:46.360
No, no, you can't do a deal with
Morgan Ives, he's, he's subhuman scum.

25:46.410 --> 25:50.435
This subhuman scum is
on the call, sweetheart.

25:50.510 --> 25:51.605
Of course you are.

25:51.721 --> 25:52.830
Jawedan, listen.

25:52.904 --> 25:58.346
I'm sorry. I did not
provide the life I promised.

25:59.334 --> 26:03.603
We should be together, walking
through the fields of Camomile.

26:03.678 --> 26:06.070
That's what I promised and I'm sorry.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.254
Enough with this "Mills and Boon" shit.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.662
Tell my people where you
are. I'll get you picked up.

26:16.003 --> 26:21.308
So, how's it gonna work when
you die? The Seventytwo Virgins.

26:21.370 --> 26:25.534
She'd have to be a very
understanding wife to put up

26:25.608 --> 26:28.794
with that amount of extracurricular pussy.

26:46.410 --> 26:47.450
Da?

26:48.730 --> 26:50.043
Sweet!

26:55.792 --> 26:56.984
About Jensen.

26:59.426 --> 27:01.506
Look, Donovan wasn't telling
the truth about Lowry being a

27:01.530 --> 27:02.691
British agent.

27:03.250 --> 27:06.322
So, maybe she wasn't being straight
about Jensen's situation either.

27:19.666 --> 27:21.671
He's got this system where he
has to check in every twentyfour

27:21.695 --> 27:23.179
hours or I get an alert.

27:23.812 --> 27:31.110
It's bloody annoying, I told him to quit
it, but... I got one earlier and, err...

27:31.445 --> 27:33.885
What? Well, that could be
for any number of reasons.

27:35.092 --> 27:36.578
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

27:37.921 --> 27:39.948
You wanna do me a favour
and fire up that Quattro?

27:40.828 --> 27:43.437
Odds on there's a spare set
of keys under the wheel arch.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.341
If not, I'll bust up the locks.

27:48.090 --> 27:49.127
Gracie, look.

27:55.784 --> 27:56.878
OK.

28:01.424 --> 28:04.528
Come on.

28:17.090 --> 28:18.557
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

28:23.170 --> 28:24.522
Give me an update, Captain.

28:24.947 --> 28:27.727
Still en route, ETA 2 hours.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.820
The team?

28:30.147 --> 28:31.147
Nothing.

28:32.013 --> 28:33.504
I would have thought
they'd come after you.

28:33.528 --> 28:34.774
Yeah, me too.

28:36.368 --> 28:38.625
Maybe we should try to
contact them. Loop them in?

28:39.244 --> 28:41.869
Right now, the main concern
is delivering Idrisi.

28:43.010 --> 28:46.386
Knowing how capable the team are,
I'm sure they're not far behind you.

28:47.650 --> 28:48.650
Copy that.

28:49.093 --> 28:50.104
I know.

28:50.497 --> 28:51.767
I wish there was another way, Natalie.

28:51.791 --> 28:53.559
But right now, it's for the best.

28:54.163 --> 28:55.363
Keep me informed.

28:57.688 --> 28:58.688
Copy.

29:02.250 --> 29:05.180
So, laughing boy's given us a good idea
where Ives and Idrisi might be heading.

29:05.204 --> 29:06.612
No, we will scope out Donovan.

29:06.683 --> 29:08.903
Find out why she didn't
give us the intel on Lowry.

29:09.642 --> 29:12.409
Mac, what are you doing?

29:13.355 --> 29:14.465
Taking a car.

29:15.007 --> 29:18.163
Right. Yeah, no.
That's your pimp and ride.

29:19.881 --> 29:20.885
Flip you for it.

29:21.017 --> 29:22.985
Alright. Think I've got one.

29:24.032 --> 29:25.284
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.393
- We flipped.
- You lost.

29:28.429 --> 29:29.156
Whoa.

29:29.330 --> 29:30.330
I'm driving.

29:31.477 --> 29:34.338
- Alright! Big Mac's got the wheel.
- That's not a thing.

29:34.392 --> 29:35.952
- It could become a thing.
- Better not!

29:36.010 --> 29:40.330
Guys, be careful out there.

29:51.051 --> 29:52.706
It's a hairdresser's car, anyway.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.495
Follow up the lead on Ives and Idrisi.

29:57.559 --> 30:00.106
Find out where the Atlas
is. We'll stay in touch.

30:00.158 --> 30:01.518
Copy that, Captain.

30:48.142 --> 30:49.779
Boss has got some company.

30:50.440 --> 30:55.300
I'm counting two, three,
gotta assume there's more.

30:55.495 --> 30:56.827
Weapons on you.

30:56.948 --> 30:57.948
Great.

30:59.575 --> 31:01.815
Don't make any sudden movements.

31:05.503 --> 31:08.625
Captain Reynolds, where's Idrisi?

31:10.639 --> 31:15.269
Don't you feel better now you're
dressed like a normal person?

31:16.764 --> 31:17.489
Come on.

31:17.575 --> 31:21.243
Relax. You give us the
Atlas, we let you go free.

31:21.655 --> 31:22.775
Bed time, mate.

31:25.056 --> 31:27.832
I actually like you, Omair.

31:27.888 --> 31:30.127
The feeling is not mutual.

31:30.163 --> 31:34.906
You remind me of an ant,
striving away, unaware of how

31:34.961 --> 31:38.572
insignificant you are.

31:40.291 --> 31:45.845
The west needs people like you, to
justify those fat military budgets.

31:46.186 --> 31:49.139
It's why they let you live for so long.

31:50.083 --> 31:56.807
Your jihad was nothing
but a cog in their machine.

31:58.192 --> 32:01.027
You have no idea what I fight for.

32:01.263 --> 32:04.167
Touched a nerve?

32:04.431 --> 32:10.144
Don't worry. Few days, you'll be
back in some dark, dank cave again.

32:13.403 --> 32:16.203
It's a wonderful life you've got.

32:21.297 --> 32:22.504
Tell you something.

32:22.540 --> 32:25.454
Morgan Ives would get a gold
medal for breaking balls.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.562
If you only had one bullet...

32:29.255 --> 32:33.655
Idrisi. Killed my squad.
Changed everything.

32:33.726 --> 32:35.712
Yeah, but then you
would never have met me.

32:36.369 --> 32:38.129
Another good reason, then.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.502
Is he the only reason we're doing this?

32:40.538 --> 32:42.396
That's the mission, yes. You know that.

32:43.437 --> 32:44.437
Natalie?

32:44.477 --> 32:45.710
Are we alone?

32:45.796 --> 32:48.343
Of course. Just you and me.

32:48.386 --> 32:51.112
What is it? Where's Idrisi?

32:53.103 --> 32:56.119
Why didn't you tell us that
Jane Lowry was a British agent?

33:02.519 --> 33:04.078
Is that what this is about?

33:06.723 --> 33:09.727
It was a covert program which has
since been disbanded and buried.

33:09.763 --> 33:11.517
We were after her, we
had a right to know that.

33:11.541 --> 33:13.629
Natalie, I chose Jane.

33:14.318 --> 33:16.488
I trained her. I put her in with Idrisi.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.578
And then, she asked for resources
to perform a small act of

33:20.631 --> 33:22.671
terrorism, to give her legitimacy, and...

33:24.678 --> 33:25.997
And you gave them to her?

33:26.033 --> 33:28.241
It was an unmanned ammunitions dump.

33:28.654 --> 33:31.800
A symbolic strike, that's all it was.

33:33.622 --> 33:35.288
At least, that's what she told me.

33:37.889 --> 33:42.493
And I'm sitting there, news reports
flooding in, a hotel bombing,

33:42.720 --> 33:47.504
sixtythree people dead, including
an American ambassador and his family.

33:47.837 --> 33:49.674
And if that ever gets out...

33:49.784 --> 33:52.617
Then British Military Intelligence
sanctioned and paid for an

33:52.653 --> 33:54.889
attack on an American official.

33:56.323 --> 33:58.177
There'd be no coming back from that.

34:00.089 --> 34:04.223
Everything we do, everything we
work for, it'd all be wiped out,

34:04.275 --> 34:06.166
because of one error of judgement.

34:06.202 --> 34:08.646
I didn't tell you because
no one could ever know.

34:09.091 --> 34:11.406
At least, Idrisi believes
in something, right?

34:12.085 --> 34:13.809
I can kind of respect that.

34:14.335 --> 34:19.054
But Morgan Ives, well, that son of a bitch,
is just a shit stain on a shiny suit.

34:20.367 --> 34:21.427
Incoming.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.166
You son of a bitch!

34:49.516 --> 34:50.956
I'm changing my vote.

34:52.110 --> 34:53.630
My bullet is for Lowry.

35:04.703 --> 35:09.214
So, what is the location of
this British intelligence?

35:09.277 --> 35:12.346
And how the hell did you get a hold of it?

35:12.444 --> 35:15.084
I will answer the second part, Mr. Ives.

35:16.856 --> 35:19.343
My wife used to be a British agent.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.496
That's right, Jane, is it not?

35:26.105 --> 35:27.482
And there's Project Tenebrae.

35:27.518 --> 35:31.989
You'd do anything to keep it quiet,
to stop the Americans finding out.

35:32.062 --> 35:33.237
For the greater good.

35:33.273 --> 35:34.947
And what about if someone
like Jensen discovered it?

35:34.971 --> 35:36.198
Natalie.

35:36.922 --> 35:39.098
You need to tell me what happened to him.

35:40.591 --> 35:43.606
If you want me to help you, then,
you have to tell me what happened.

35:43.668 --> 35:45.062
You said the crib was hit.

35:45.437 --> 35:48.414
If you're asking the question,
then, you already know the answer.

35:52.336 --> 35:53.856
We do what we have to do.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.457
I've taught you that
since the first day we met.

36:00.017 --> 36:02.049
They've got sights on
you, I can't do anything.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.489
You gotta give me some breathing space.

36:05.348 --> 36:07.575
Adeena, can you do me a favour?

36:07.645 --> 36:09.864
Can you ask your men to step down?

36:10.473 --> 36:13.884
They're just here for an insurance.
In case Lowry came for Idrisi.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.600
Yeah, I understand that.

36:16.638 --> 36:17.677
Of course.

36:17.971 --> 36:19.096
Of course.

36:22.856 --> 36:28.043
They're on amber alert.
Don't get comfortable.

36:28.079 --> 36:29.363
He's gonna kill her.

36:29.561 --> 36:30.763
- No, he won't.
- Yeah?

36:30.880 --> 36:32.315
Not after all they've been through.

36:32.840 --> 36:40.541
I was sent to inform on you,
to lead you to your death, but I

36:40.602 --> 36:41.772
wouldn't do it.

36:42.641 --> 36:44.054
I wouldn't do it.

36:44.989 --> 36:46.526
Everything was a lie.

36:46.588 --> 36:47.564
Here it comes.

36:47.611 --> 36:49.196
But I stayed with you.

36:49.860 --> 36:52.940
I stayed by your side, through everything.

36:53.484 --> 36:54.906
- Everything.
- Sweetheart.

36:54.975 --> 37:00.003
All I give a fuck about is
the location of the Atlas.

37:00.068 --> 37:01.108
Omair.

37:02.881 --> 37:09.254
If you had known the truth
about me, about what I was,

37:09.936 --> 37:12.539
you never could have loved me. Never.

37:14.380 --> 37:15.709
You made me.

37:19.328 --> 37:20.727
Here it comes.

37:25.040 --> 37:31.390
- You stayed.
- I stayed.

37:36.483 --> 37:38.457
God!

37:38.570 --> 37:41.739
- Son of a bitch!
- The location.

37:41.775 --> 37:42.775
- Told ya!
- All I want

37:42.847 --> 37:48.877
is the location! All I want is

37:48.913 --> 37:50.345
the Atlas.

37:54.303 --> 37:58.689
It's at the centre of a
mausoleum. On Avet Island.

37:58.725 --> 38:02.186
Got it! Avet Island, inside a mausoleum.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.781
I have a yacht, primed
and ready in the docks.

38:04.817 --> 38:11.961
But I need some more specific
fucking, goddamn, details.

38:13.096 --> 38:15.994
But you don't, I'm gonna show you.

38:16.030 --> 38:19.863
No. You're gonna tell me.

38:20.265 --> 38:25.200
Mr. Ives. My wife said
she will show you.

38:25.307 --> 38:27.081
You know, fuck it! I'm taking the shot.

38:27.117 --> 38:28.488
Wyatt, we can track them.

38:28.524 --> 38:30.864
I'm not letting them get away
this time. This is our shot.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.051
Wyatt! No!

38:32.087 --> 38:35.579
No, Mac, this is your chance. Of
not letting Lowry get away again.

38:36.129 --> 38:38.369
I'll take Lowry. You take Idrisi.

38:39.615 --> 38:40.615
Come on.

38:41.497 --> 38:45.564
OK. Line it up. Nice and clean.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.083
You have to make a choice, Natalie.

38:48.788 --> 38:53.147
Adeena. If you need to ask.

39:00.096 --> 39:01.376
She's signalling.

39:09.206 --> 39:10.523
Tower, check in.

39:11.657 --> 39:12.907
- Shit! We've been made.
- Tower?

39:12.931 --> 39:14.093
Boss, there's been a...

39:14.155 --> 39:15.196
Move, move, move!

39:15.232 --> 39:16.832
All stations report in.

39:18.712 --> 39:20.232
Wyatt, we need to move.

39:40.819 --> 39:41.624
Jawedan!

39:41.660 --> 39:44.145
Brian, Brian! Take Idrisi, now!

39:46.744 --> 39:47.744
Fuck!

39:47.854 --> 39:49.229
Jawedan!

39:49.919 --> 39:51.813
We need to move, Wyatt.
We're sitting ducks up here.

39:51.837 --> 39:53.376
Jawedan!

40:20.184 --> 40:21.233
Shit!

40:25.054 --> 40:26.823
We gotta get to the docks,
after Ives and Idrisi.

40:26.847 --> 40:28.942
Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying
to stay alive first.

40:37.258 --> 40:39.498
- Wyatt, this way.
- Yeah, yeah, go, go, go!

41:02.721 --> 41:05.450
That was good, nicely done.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.346
When I found you, your career
was over, you were nothing.

41:11.459 --> 41:15.724
No, me, Jane, the rest,
we were never nothing.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.328
See, that's your mistake.

41:17.912 --> 41:19.819
You never see the bigger picture.

41:20.802 --> 41:22.802
All I ever tried to do was help.

41:23.828 --> 41:26.411
He... He wouldn't stop.
I tried to warn him.

41:26.447 --> 41:32.129
But he wouldn't. You see how it spreads.

41:32.165 --> 41:34.438
Him, then you, then
the rest of the Section.

41:35.008 --> 41:38.865
Word gets out, and then
it all comes crashing down.

41:38.935 --> 41:40.728
All you were trying to
do was protect yourself.

41:40.752 --> 41:45.122
No, no, no. To protect
everything we're fighting for.

41:52.538 --> 41:54.467
You're not taking me in, are you?

41:58.407 --> 42:00.088
I know the kind of person you are.

42:01.088 --> 42:04.946
This will stay with you.
There's no coming back from this.

42:35.839 --> 42:37.996
Novin. Novin!

42:52.792 --> 42:54.482
- Fuck.
- Drop your weapon.

42:54.559 --> 42:56.866
Alright. Easy.

42:56.902 --> 42:58.726
- Get on the floor! Now!
- Easy.

42:58.762 --> 42:59.809
Going down.

43:10.626 --> 43:13.843
Fuck! Alright, now I'm really done.

43:22.182 --> 43:23.579
Any last words?

43:25.848 --> 43:27.004
Fuck you.

43:27.058 --> 43:28.871
Good for me, what do you reckon?

43:30.063 --> 43:31.196
Works for me.

43:45.761 --> 43:47.521
Here. Like your hair.

43:48.449 --> 43:50.657
Get the chance for last words,
go for some poetry, a bit of.

43:50.681 --> 43:52.016
Keats, Tennyson.

43:52.052 --> 43:53.611
Or Zeppelin, Stones.

43:53.647 --> 43:55.706
Yeah, anything that'll buy you more time.

43:55.977 --> 43:57.947
- They're inside here.
- We've got company.

43:59.211 --> 44:00.596
I'll remember that next time.

44:00.657 --> 44:04.239
Of course it's always better not
to get grabbed in the first place.

44:04.356 --> 44:05.777
Who the hell are you guys, anyway?

44:05.813 --> 44:07.145
It's a long story.

44:07.217 --> 44:08.879
Well, save it for next time.

44:09.508 --> 44:10.836
- Clear?
- Clear.

44:11.698 --> 44:12.698
On me.

44:13.217 --> 44:14.790
That's not how we're doing things.

44:15.404 --> 44:17.164
Wasn't asking, dickhead.

44:23.518 --> 44:24.992
There's no way out! Hey!

44:25.028 --> 44:25.767
Wyatt.

44:25.803 --> 44:27.807
Hey, I just want you guys
to know something, right?

44:27.921 --> 44:32.401
I thought I was done being part of the
team, but, turns out I was wrong.

44:32.478 --> 44:34.314
There's worse ways to go, right?

44:37.263 --> 44:38.266
Wyatt!
