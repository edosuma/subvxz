WEBVTT

00:10.845 --> 00:14.181
("Away in the Manger")

01:07.693 --> 01:10.196
- And that's why we
celebrate Christmas.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.073
It's the birth of Jesus Christ.

01:13.157 --> 01:17.578
- [Katy] So, Christmas
is Jesus' birthday?

01:17.661 --> 01:18.788
- That's right, baby girl.

01:18.871 --> 01:19.830
You got it.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.001
- Where did Jesus live?

01:26.086 --> 01:26.879
- What?

01:28.964 --> 01:31.926
- He didn't really have
a place to live, did he?

01:33.719 --> 01:35.805
- It's time to go
to sleep now, baby.

01:35.888 --> 01:36.722
I love you.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.224
Let's say our prayers, okay?

01:38.307 --> 01:39.225
- [Katy] Okay.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.267
- All right.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.103
Dear Lord Jesus,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.690
thank you for all
your blessings.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.485
You, Lord, are our provider.

01:50.945 --> 01:53.864
We ask that you
continue providing for
us and keep us safe.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.868
Oh God, we thank you
that we have each other.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.496
In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.627
- [Katy] Amen.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.892
- [Rose] Katy, come
on, quit playing.

02:21.976 --> 02:22.685
Come on now.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.854
- But Momma!
- You're gonna be late

02:24.937 --> 02:26.355
for school.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.648
- But Momma.
- Jack is gonna

02:27.731 --> 02:29.108
have breakfast for you
when you get out there.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.318
And always remember
to thank him.

02:31.402 --> 02:34.572
- But Mom, I said I need
a tablet for school.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.489
- What?

02:35.573 --> 02:36.824
- Hey Rose, you got a table.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.617
- Oh my gosh.

02:39.535 --> 02:40.411
(groans)

02:40.494 --> 02:41.954
- [Dot] Don't worry about it.
I can take care of this.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.247
- Are you sure?

02:43.330 --> 02:44.665
I just need to dry her
and put her hair up.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.958
- No problem.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.209
- [Rose] Thank you, I
gotta go earn a tablet.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.627
- [Dot] Well then
you better make nice.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.929
- Oh, I'm sorry.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.014
I'm so sorry.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.478
Hey, what can I get ya?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.272
- (chuckles) That's
usually my line.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.150
- [Rose] Cute,
what can I get you?

03:12.735 --> 03:14.403
- Did somebody put a lump
of coal in your stocking?

03:14.486 --> 03:16.530
- (laughs) The only thing
that's been in these stocking

03:16.614 --> 03:18.073
the last few years
has been sore feet.

03:18.157 --> 03:18.866
What can I get ya?

03:18.949 --> 03:20.701
- Now see, that's funny.

03:21.869 --> 03:26.040
Okay, give me the
Santa Sunrise Special.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.085
- Anything else?

03:30.169 --> 03:31.837
- No thanks, Velma.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.342
- I grabbed the wrong name tag.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.259
It's Rose.

03:37.343 --> 03:41.096
- Well, Rose, nice to meet you.

03:41.180 --> 03:41.889
- You too.

03:41.972 --> 03:42.890
- I'm Santa.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.058
- Of course you are.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.059
- [Jack] Order up, Dot.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.714
- Coffee?

04:18.968 --> 04:20.344
- I'm only seven.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.178
- I see.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.599
I had you pegged
for at least eight.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.893
- Momma says I'm
mature for my age.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.144
How old are you?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.274
- I'm as old as Christmas.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.361
- Did you know Jesus?

04:38.570 --> 04:39.363
- No, no.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.991
No, he was over in Bethlehem.

04:43.993 --> 04:45.285
I was up there.

04:48.914 --> 04:49.707
North.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.459
Pole.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.004
Long ways.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.013
- Do you visit
everybody in the world?

05:04.096 --> 05:05.681
- Of course I do.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.225
Everybody deserves
something for Christmas.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.477
- I thought you had a list.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.063
You know, a good
list and a bad list.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.148
- Sure, I do.

05:17.651 --> 05:22.156
But there just
aren't that many kids

05:22.239 --> 05:24.908
that are so bad I wouldn't
visit 'em at Christmas.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.997
They have to be pretty
darn bad, don't you think?

05:43.177 --> 05:43.969
Bye.

05:54.730 --> 05:58.108
- Bro, what is wrong with you?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.026
- Excuse me.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.653
- Not everybody
believes in Santa Claus.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.240
Nor do they need to.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.159
Do you really feel
like your little thing

06:07.242 --> 06:10.621
of balancing of scales, if
you're good, you get a gift,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.122
if you're naughty, you
don't get anything?

06:12.206 --> 06:14.249
Is that working
out for everybody?

06:20.214 --> 06:21.924
- More coffee, Santa?

06:24.093 --> 06:25.094
- Excuse me.
- No!

06:25.177 --> 06:27.679
No, I don't think I can.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.473
- That's more of that
Christmas spirit.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.767
Look, I just came in
here for breakfast,

06:31.850 --> 06:33.060
spread a little Christmas cheer.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.937
- Wow and you're
the professional?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.857
- I don't understand
any of this.

06:41.068 --> 06:41.860
- Okay.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.241
Rose is a special
person around here.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.701
And so is that little girl.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.662
She's a single mom.

06:51.745 --> 06:56.166
She can't buy groceries,
much less Christmas presents.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.673
- [Santa] Sugar?

07:02.756 --> 07:03.507
- Diet.

07:08.387 --> 07:13.392
Listen, that little girl
didn't choose this road.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.397
When Rose came here, she
wasn't looking for a job.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.192
She wanted to wash
dishes or clean,

07:22.276 --> 07:24.695
anything it took
to get Katy a meal.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.156
One single meal.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.619
Jack fed them both and
gave Rose this job.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.665
- How does this happen?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.292
- Katy's a good kid.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.003
She doesn't have Christmas.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.422
A lot of kids don't.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.842
You ever worked a farm?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.218
- Order up, Dot.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.053
- Coming.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.849
You know, growing up
when a fence was down,

07:55.058 --> 07:58.395
my dad would fix it
because if he didn't,

07:59.229 --> 08:00.772
the cattle would get out.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.362
You see, fences don't
keep bad things out,

08:07.446 --> 08:09.239
they keep good things in.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.201
There ain't no bad kids, Santa.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.328
There just aren't
many fence menders.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.458
Dear Santa, thank you
for talking to me today.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.546
Mommy says I shouldn't
believe in you,

09:47.629 --> 09:51.133
but she's just sad, I think.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
I wish she would believe in you.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.012
Maybe she would be happy.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.097
Believing in you makes me happy.

09:58.307 --> 10:01.018
I am going to try to be
extra good this year.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.605
I wrote you a letter
last year and mailed it,

10:05.689 --> 10:07.316
but you didn't come.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.735
Maybe you didn't get it.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.655
Or maybe I was on the bad list.

10:15.157 --> 10:19.411
That's why I wanted to give
you this letter myself.

10:19.494 --> 10:22.331
Now I know if you come,
that I was a good girl.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.376
But if you don't,
I will know why.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.796
Say hello to Mrs. Santa.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.423
Do you have any children?

10:31.506 --> 10:33.675
Love, Katy Elizabeth Yates.

10:33.759 --> 10:38.305
P.S. I drew you a picture of
what I want for Christmas.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.848
I hope it's not too late.

11:05.791 --> 11:06.958
- Oh hey, Charley.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.753
Dinner's almost ready.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.380
- I'll eat later.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.464
- Where are you going?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.384
Where are you going?

11:17.219 --> 11:20.347
- Nancy, I can't
do this anymore.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.431
- Do what?

11:22.432 --> 11:25.477
- Be Santa.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.645
I'm no Santa.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.314

13:25.472 --> 13:28.517
- I'm serious, I'm Santa.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.644
- Well of course
you are, Charley.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.229
You have been ever
since you joined

13:32.312 --> 13:34.689
the Salvation Army 14 years ago.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.358
- No, Nanc.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.192
No.

13:38.068 --> 13:42.030
I mean, I really am Santa Claus.

13:42.113 --> 13:42.864
- [Nancy] Uh-huh.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.701
- All right, who's Santa?

13:49.079 --> 13:52.541
- He's the jolly old soul
who's lives at the North Pole

13:52.624 --> 13:56.294
who's got the really cute
wife named Mrs. Claus.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.671
He has tons of elves.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.548
They make toys all year long.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.299
He delivers them
on Christmas Eve.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.220
- Aside from that, who's Santa?

14:06.471 --> 14:11.476
All right, Santa
spreads Christmas cheer.

14:12.644 --> 14:16.606
He brings joy and
laughter to the kids.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.985
He triggers the most incredible,

14:20.068 --> 14:23.697
incredible childhood
memories in adults.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.158
His face stops tears, Nanc.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.869
(Nancy chuckles)

14:34.583 --> 14:38.712
He's a man put on this Earth
for a little girl to believe in

14:38.795 --> 14:40.755
when she's got
nothing else going on.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.678
- And...

14:51.224 --> 14:53.184
He brings presents.

14:54.102 --> 14:54.894
- Right.

14:56.438 --> 14:57.981
Did you get everything you
asked for for Christmas?

14:58.064 --> 15:00.150
- [Nancy] Not until I
married you, Charley.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.236
- Case closed, I'm Santa.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.990
- [Nancy] I love you, Charley.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.618
- I bet you do now that
you know who I really am.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.288

15:20.920 --> 15:21.796

15:23.214 --> 15:24.924
and the bus is gonna
be here any minute.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.135
What are you doing
with comb in there?

15:27.218 --> 15:28.219
- [Katy] I'm drowning!

15:28.303 --> 15:29.679
- Oh, don't be so dramatic.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.722
Okay, come on.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.433
- It's in my eyes.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.646
- Rose, he's here again
and he asked for you.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.356
- Who?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.857
- [Dot] Well, it ain't
the Easter Bunny.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.900
- Can you take over here?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.735
- Can't, hun, I'm swamped.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.739
- Katy, we're late.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.783
The bus is gonna
be here any minute.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.242
I'm gonna have breakfast
for you outside.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.036

16:42.502 --> 16:43.253
- Santa.

16:44.713 --> 16:48.216
- I'd like to Katy for just a
little bit if you don't mind.

17:05.275 --> 17:05.983
- Thank you.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.027
- [Rose] You're welcome.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.157
- You want some coffee?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.954
That's right, you're only seven.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.207
I like your hair.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.542
- I did it myself.

17:24.919 --> 17:25.837
- It's nice.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.762
- Did you read my letter?

17:37.098 --> 17:38.016
- Yes, I did.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.643
It was wonderful, thank you.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.523
- Well, can you tell
what list I'm on?

17:49.277 --> 17:53.948
- Katy, you've never
been on the bad list.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.995
- Then why haven't you
ever brought me anything?

18:04.793 --> 18:08.922
- Katy, why do you
like to believe in me?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.715
- It makes me happy.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.884
- Yeah.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.014
Did you ever get
your mom something?

18:19.057 --> 18:19.849
- Flowers.

18:22.018 --> 18:22.811
- Was she happy?

18:25.897 --> 18:30.235
Okay, is your mom happy even
when you don't get her flowers?

18:30.318 --> 18:31.069
- Of course.

18:31.152 --> 18:31.903
- Okay.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.405
That's joy, Katy.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.159
You bring your mom joy,

18:39.077 --> 18:40.829
just because you're you.

18:42.914 --> 18:47.001
And Katy, I bring you
something every year, too.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.838
- Joy?

18:49.921 --> 18:50.839
- [Santa] That's right.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.299
- [Rose] Katy, bus, baby.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.845
- Did you understand?

18:56.928 --> 18:59.806
- Uh-huh, you brought me
happy thoughts every year.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.849
- Right.

19:09.107 --> 19:13.027
- Would you mind bringing
me a toy this year?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.341
- What is that?

19:39.929 --> 19:41.055
- Look who came in.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.265
- [Rose] Oh, good diversion.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.894
- Oh, he's looking
at your paintings.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.231
Here he comes.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.733
He's coming.

19:51.816 --> 19:52.692
- Shut up.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.484
- [Luke] Hey Jack.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.277
- [Jack] Hey.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.153
- How are ya?

19:55.236 --> 19:56.404
- I'm doing just fine.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.572
- [Luke] Back again
for another one.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.908
- That makes three paintings.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.578
- $200, right?
- $200.

20:03.661 --> 20:04.913
- [Luke] Great.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.498
- [Jack] You sure that's $200?

20:07.582 --> 20:08.416
- Positive.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.375
- Okay, thank you very much.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.044
- Thank you.
- And he's cute.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.891
- Rose, why don't you
let me tell everyone

20:24.974 --> 20:26.100
that you're the artist?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.269
- [Rose] Jack.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.520
- Everyone just wants to know

20:29.604 --> 20:31.105
who paints those
beautiful pictures.

20:31.189 --> 20:31.940
- You're sweet.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.107
- I know that.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.067
(laughs)

20:34.150 --> 20:35.818
- Give me that money.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.033
(soft somber music)

21:32.959 --> 21:34.210
- Are you okay?

21:36.295 --> 21:37.839
- Yeah, I'm all right.

21:37.922 --> 21:38.756
I'm all right.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.760
It just, it's so different here.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.220
- You knew it would be.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.557
It's a small town, Charley.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.351
It's not Cincinnati.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.021
Are you happy here?

21:53.104 --> 21:54.063
- Yeah.

21:56.691 --> 21:57.859
It's real, you know?

21:59.068 --> 22:01.529
- You miss the snow
this time of year?

22:01.612 --> 22:03.406
- Yes, yeah.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.118
Snow made it way easier to
get my sleigh off the ground

22:07.201 --> 22:07.910
that's for sure.

22:07.994 --> 22:08.953
- No, thank you.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.079
- I'm good, thank you.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.080
- [Waiter] You guys enjoy.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.540
- Alrighty.

22:12.623 --> 22:13.791
Merry Christmas.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.961
- [Santa] I love it
when you say that.

22:20.131 --> 22:23.009
- Speaking of Christmas.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.635
- I got you covered.

22:26.054 --> 22:30.183
- Actually, I was
wondering how Katy was.

22:32.977 --> 22:33.770
- Yeah.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.064
Yeah, she's a tough one.

22:37.690 --> 22:42.111
You know, she may be
only seven years old,

22:42.195 --> 22:46.491
but she ain't seven years old.

22:46.574 --> 22:47.658
- Smart?

22:47.742 --> 22:51.037
- Yeah but wise, you know?

22:52.538 --> 22:55.041
And Nancy, I think she's trying

22:55.124 --> 22:57.585
to reach out to
me for something.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.378
I think she needs something.

23:00.671 --> 23:05.093
Every time I've tried
to reach her, I failed.

- [Radio] And so in closing
tonight and in the spirit

25:48.422 --> 25:50.716
of the Christmas season,
I would remind you

25:50.800 --> 25:53.052
of the word spoken by
Jesus Christ himself

25:53.135 --> 25:56.138
in the gospel of
Matthew chapter 25.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.724
He said for I was hungry
and you gave me food.

25:58.808 --> 26:01.102
I was thirsty and
you gave me drink.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.062
I was a stranger
and you took me in.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.147
I was naked and you clothed me.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.108
I was sick and you visited me.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.110
I was imprisoned
and you came to me.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.611
Then the righteous
will answer Him saying,

26:10.695 --> 26:13.239
Lord, when did we see
you hungry and feed you,

26:13.322 --> 26:15.199
or thirsty and give you drink?

26:15.283 --> 26:17.285
When did we see you a
stranger and take you in

26:17.368 --> 26:19.078
or naked and clothed you?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.247
Or when did we see
you sick or imprisoned

26:21.330 --> 26:22.540
and come to you?

26:22.623 --> 26:24.208
And the King will
answer and say to them,

26:24.292 --> 26:25.751
certainly I say to you,

26:25.835 --> 26:27.962
in as much you did to one
of the least of these,

26:28.045 --> 26:29.588
my brethren, you did it to me.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.050
And so to everyone within the
sound of my voice tonight,

26:33.134 --> 26:34.927
I would say reach out
to the least of these

26:35.011 --> 26:36.637
in this season of
giving and love.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.264
And I bid you all good night.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.974
And to all a very,
very merry Christmas.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.102
- All right, baby, let's
get ready for bed, okay?

26:43.185 --> 26:45.021
- Can I pray tonight?

26:45.104 --> 26:45.855
- Okay.

26:50.943 --> 26:51.736
Ready?

26:53.279 --> 26:56.282
- Dear God, thank you for my mom

26:56.365 --> 26:58.367
and all of our blessings.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.456
Lord, I heard the
preacher on the radio say

27:03.539 --> 27:07.043
that what we do to the least
of these, we do to you.

27:08.252 --> 27:11.672
Lord, who are the
least of these?

27:11.756 --> 27:14.425
Show me so that I can
do something for you.

27:18.262 --> 27:23.225
God bless my mom and Dot
and everybody at the diner.

27:24.477 --> 27:29.023
Bless all my teachers
except Miss Hastings.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.400
- Katy.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.904
- She gives me
too much homework.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.365
And she whistles through
her nose when she breaths.

27:39.909 --> 27:40.659
- Well.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.873
- Bless Miss Hastings.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.000
Keep us safe tonight, Lord.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.586
And merry Christmas.

27:52.922 --> 27:53.714
Amen.

28:13.484 --> 28:14.819
- Katy, baby, good morning.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.195
It's time to wake up.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.658
Katy, baby, wake up.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.161
Katy?

28:25.246 --> 28:26.747
Katy!

28:26.831 --> 28:27.581
Katy!

28:29.083 --> 28:30.126
Katy, Katy?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.502
Katy!

28:31.585 --> 28:32.420
Katy, Katy.

28:40.511 --> 28:41.554
Katy!

28:41.637 --> 28:42.972
Katy.

28:43.055 --> 28:43.806
Katy!

28:45.099 --> 28:46.475
Katy!

28:46.559 --> 28:47.435
Katy, Katy.

28:48.436 --> 28:50.563
Katy, Katy, Katy, Katy.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.690
Katy!

28:52.773 --> 28:53.649
Katy, Katy!

28:55.401 --> 28:57.111
Katy Elizabeth!

28:57.194 --> 28:58.446
Katy!

28:58.529 --> 28:59.447
Katy.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.239
Katy!

29:00.322 --> 29:00.990
Katy!

29:05.828 --> 29:06.620
Katy?

29:09.123 --> 29:10.833
No, Katy, Katy, Katy.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.881
Baby, baby, can you hear me?

29:16.964 --> 29:17.715
Katy?

29:19.717 --> 29:20.801
Are you okay?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.054
Katy!

29:27.683 --> 29:28.476
No, no.

29:35.149 --> 29:35.941
- Rose.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.235
What happened?

29:40.529 --> 29:41.780
- I don't know.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.408
She use to do this
when she was little,

29:44.492 --> 29:46.035
but it's been forever ago.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.413
She was like a toddler
last time it happened.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.664
- What?

29:50.748 --> 29:54.043
- I put her to bed,
said good night,

29:54.126 --> 29:57.922
I went to sleep, and
then I heard glass

29:58.005 --> 30:01.008
or something break in the
kitchen and I couldn't find her.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.512
And so I went downstairs
and there she was

30:04.595 --> 30:06.597
in the middle of
the kitchen floor.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.516
I don't know how you got there.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.643
I don't know why it
has to be like this.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.144
- It's gonna be okay.
- I don't know

30:12.228 --> 30:15.397
why it has to be.
- It's gonna be all right.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.363
- [Nurse] Hey, it looks like
she's gonna be just fine.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.200
But I do need to get some
personal information from you.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.202
If you could, step
over here at the desk

30:28.285 --> 30:29.828
and I'll ask you some of
those questions, okay?

30:30.788 --> 30:32.289
- Okay.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.756
- What I need to go ahead
and get is Katy's full name.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.679
- Katy Elizabeth Yates.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.061
- And your full name.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.356
- Katherine Rose Phelps.

30:57.439 --> 31:02.278
She has my first name
and her dad's last name.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.614
- And a home address.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.037
- We just, um, we just moved.

31:12.121 --> 31:16.417
So, I can't remember
the address.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.591
- 2728 Hawthorne Circle.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.092
Fayetteville, Tennessee.

31:25.968 --> 31:26.760
Christmas card.

31:28.178 --> 31:28.929
- [Nurse] Thank you.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.139
- You bet.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.473
- [Nurse] You're
welcome to have a seat

31:31.557 --> 31:32.766
and the doctor will come
visit you shortly, okay?

31:32.850 --> 31:35.561
- All right, thank you.

31:51.702 --> 31:52.620
- She's amazing.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.248
- The most.

32:16.810 --> 32:17.811
Adorable tree.

32:19.146 --> 32:22.107
- Ah yeah, that
would be Mrs. Claus.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.735
She's the decorator here.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.821
She loves Christmas
about as much as I do.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.198
You want to know the truth?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.158
I'm not allowed to
touch that tree.

32:31.241 --> 32:31.992
Not one ornament.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.787
- Hey.

32:34.870 --> 32:35.788
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.706
- I can't lay a
finger on that tree.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.087
Hey, let me know if
that's hot enough.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.046
- Thanks.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.633
There are a lot of groceries
out there in the car.

32:47.716 --> 32:48.634
- [Rose] Oh, let me help you.

32:48.717 --> 32:49.885
- Absolutely not.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.804

33:19.873 --> 33:21.792

33:23.961 --> 33:25.170
- Yeah.

33:25.254 --> 33:27.715

is, how you doing?

33:29.842 --> 33:31.343

33:37.599 --> 33:40.310
I just need a little time

33:40.394 --> 33:43.605
- You stay as long as
you need to, all right?

33:43.689 --> 33:46.734
What kind of people would
we be to not give a mother

33:46.817 --> 33:49.361
and a child a place to
stay at Christmas time?

33:50.279 --> 33:52.030
You know, the truth of it is,

33:53.657 --> 33:55.868
we're so incredibly blessed.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.495
I mean, Charley and I
both worked all our lives

33:58.579 --> 34:00.122
and you know,
earned what we have,

34:00.205 --> 34:02.791
but along the way so many
people gave us opportunities

34:02.875 --> 34:05.335
and thankfully we had the health

34:05.419 --> 34:07.713
to pursue those opportunities.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.466
And Rose, you're not
asking for a handout.

34:20.684 --> 34:21.893

It feels good to have

- Please.

37:24.785 --> 37:25.994
- No.

37:26.078 --> 37:27.829
I mean, I'd like to but...

37:39.383 --> 37:41.009
Do you have someone like that?

37:43.679 --> 37:47.849
- Yeah, I do, sort of.

37:47.933 --> 37:48.809
- Your dad?

37:51.144 --> 37:52.145
- No.

37:56.650 --> 37:57.442
My son.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.779
- Is he a bad person too?

38:00.862 --> 38:02.531
I mean, like my dad?

38:02.614 --> 38:03.991
- No, no.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.202
He's a good man.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.249
We don't get along.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.421
- How long has it been
since you've seen him?

38:20.340 --> 38:22.968
- Well, six, many seven years.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.390
- Oh, you mean you
didn't get along.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.980
Six or seven years
is a long time.

38:35.063 --> 38:38.108
People change a lot.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.862
In sevens years,
I went from a baby

38:41.945 --> 38:46.908
who didn't even know not
to poop on herself to this.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.954
I can walk, talk, go to
school, read, and write.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.376
Maybe you should call him.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.046
Maybe he's changed.

39:00.297 --> 39:01.757
Maybe you've changed.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.094
- Katy, that's a lot of time.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.138
A lot of time's gone by.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.266
There's also a lot
of unforgiveness.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.268
- You or him?

39:17.064 --> 39:17.939
I guess you.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.318
- Well, what makes
you say it's me?

39:23.028 --> 39:27.199
- Well, if you haven't seen
him in six or seven years,

39:27.282 --> 39:29.284
how'd you know he
hasn't forgiven you?

39:33.121 --> 39:36.041
- Look, Katy, you
don't understand.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.292
Adults have--
- Mom says

39:37.375 --> 39:41.088
unforgiveness is
bad for everybody.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.592
She says when you
don't forgive someone,

39:45.675 --> 39:47.260
it's like holding them prisoner.

39:48.762 --> 39:53.100
She also says when there's
isn't forgiven, nobody's free.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.104
You have to guard your prisoner

39:59.022 --> 40:02.234
and so the only way for you
to be free is to free him.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.744

(chuckles)

40:15.372 --> 40:16.957
Call him.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.166
Free yourself.

40:21.795 --> 40:22.838
- [Rose] All right, baby.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.262

40:30.345 --> 40:31.346
- No, no, thank you.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.475
Why don't you give me her's too?

40:35.559 --> 40:38.019

sweet, Charley.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.330
You okay?
- Yeah.

42:25.794 --> 42:30.131
- I don't suppose you're
the one that paints these?

42:31.424 --> 42:33.218
Merry Christmas, Rose.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.553
- Merry Christmas.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.013
He forgot the coffee.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.974
- [Jack] Maybe he
didn't want the coffee.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.142
- Just turn it on around.

42:46.439 --> 42:48.525
He's like that much cute.

42:50.402 --> 42:51.736
- Hey, merry Christmas.

42:51.820 --> 42:52.696
- Merry Christmas to you.

42:52.779 --> 42:54.239
- Well, thank you, my good man.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.949
- You free Friday night, Santa?

42:57.242 --> 42:58.702
- I am but you know
I'm married, right?

43:01.288 --> 43:03.290
- I want you to be Santa
at a Christmas party.

43:04.541 --> 43:06.793
It pays well.

43:08.295 --> 43:09.421

43:10.422 --> 43:12.215
- Bring anyone you like.

Here's my card.

you for Christmas?

43:23.435 --> 43:24.686

43:45.498 --> 43:47.959
How do you drink
that nasty stuff?

43:48.043 --> 43:50.545
- 'Cause I gotta
lose some of this.

- Honey, you are just
fine the way you are

43:53.173 --> 43:54.466
without drinking
all that nastiness.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.092
- It ain't that bad.

43:56.176 --> 43:57.969

44:10.440 --> 44:12.525

ain't just about

something you're drinking.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.572
It's about what
you're missing out on.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.324
- It's not much.

44:19.407 --> 44:20.450
- Ice.

44:20.533 --> 44:21.242
- No, no, no.

44:21.326 --> 44:22.327
- Uh-huh.

44:22.410 --> 44:23.244
Cream.
- Don't go there.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.871
- Big old chocolate sundae.

44:26.039 --> 44:28.541
- You are wrong for that.

44:28.625 --> 44:31.419
Ooh, girl, that is
like heaven in a bowl.

44:31.503 --> 44:33.505
A great big bowl.

44:33.588 --> 44:35.215
- I know you love it.

44:35.298 --> 44:36.549
I'm freezing, I'm gonna go in.

44:36.633 --> 44:37.384
- Okay, I'll be in there.

44:37.467 --> 44:38.468
- Okay.

44:41.846 --> 44:42.972
- Hey Mr. Sax Man.

44:59.489 --> 45:01.616
(humming)

45:07.205 --> 45:09.416
You keep watch, all right?

45:20.009 --> 45:21.469
- I need to get you some socks.

45:21.553 --> 45:23.596
- But I like my toes.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.766
See, they're wiggly.

45:26.850 --> 45:28.351
Look at them wiggle.

45:31.479 --> 45:34.482
- Oh, you are crazy.

45:36.192 --> 45:37.360
- Mom?
- Mm-hm?

45:37.444 --> 45:39.904
- It's not that I
don't believe in Santa.

45:39.988 --> 45:40.989
It's just...

45:47.954 --> 45:50.999
Mr. Charley doesn't
live in the North Pole.

45:51.082 --> 45:55.503
He lives here in
Fayetteville in this house.

45:57.046 --> 46:00.258
- Yes but you know a lot of
people believe in Santa Claus.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.343
Like what about the people

46:02.427 --> 46:04.262
that pass him on the
street every day?

46:05.722 --> 46:07.891
- Just because people
give him money,

46:07.974 --> 46:10.018
does not mean they
believe he is Santa.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.437
- Well, what about all the kids

46:12.520 --> 46:14.647
that give him their
Christmas list every year?

46:19.527 --> 46:24.532
Katy, honey, Mr. Charley has
given us a safe place to stay,

46:25.533 --> 46:27.076
food on the table.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.995
Don't you think he's
been Santa to us?

46:33.500 --> 46:35.710
- Do you believe in Santa?

46:38.087 --> 46:39.005
- Yeah, I do.

46:41.883 --> 46:44.761
And I think he lives
right here in this house.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.848
All right, snuggle bug.

46:48.932 --> 46:51.059
You do not have school,

46:52.560 --> 46:55.104
so you're gonna come down
to the diner with me.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.856
And let you wait tables
for a little while for me,

46:56.940 --> 46:59.275
so your momma can get a break.

46:59.359 --> 47:01.986
Show you why you outta
go to college, okay?

47:02.070 --> 47:06.032
You got drowsy all over
snuggled up in here.

47:06.115 --> 47:07.951
You wanna do the
prayers tonight, munchy?

47:08.034 --> 47:10.453
- No, I want to hear you pray.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.957
- Okay, okay.

47:17.585 --> 47:18.378
Okay.

47:20.588 --> 47:21.714
Dear Father.

47:24.217 --> 47:28.096
Dear God, thank you so much

47:29.556 --> 47:34.769
for bringing back my precious
Katy safe and sound to me.

47:38.064 --> 47:40.733
Once again you show
yourself faithful

47:40.817 --> 47:43.611
even when I am not.

47:43.695 --> 47:47.198
And we just pray for forgiveness

47:48.741 --> 47:51.953
and for You to keep
me safe, keep us safe.

47:53.788 --> 47:56.374
Thank you for Nancy and Charley.

47:56.457 --> 47:58.585
I ask that you just
keep blessings upon them

47:59.836 --> 48:02.589
and this house, everyone
that dwells here.

48:04.924 --> 48:08.011
Pray for forgiveness,
for clarity,

48:08.094 --> 48:10.346
just to remain
teachable and open.

48:12.098 --> 48:14.892
In your precious Son's
name we pray, Amen.

48:16.686 --> 48:17.895
- [Katy] Amen.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.273
- Good night, baby.

48:20.356 --> 48:21.441

48:22.525 --> 48:24.068

48:25.403 --> 48:26.821
Sweet dreams.

48:30.617 --> 48:31.618

48:31.701 --> 48:32.660
- Mm-hm?

48:32.744 --> 48:36.664

own Bible for Christmas?

48:36.748 --> 48:39.917
- Yeah, but you know
who you outta ask?

48:40.001 --> 48:42.837
Santa Claus and he's just
over there in the next room.

48:50.678 --> 48:51.804
- Do it here.

48:53.890 --> 48:54.807
Here we go.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.068
- Hey, get there as
early as you can.

49:05.151 --> 49:06.361
We're going out tonight.

49:07.654 --> 49:08.946
It's a surprise.

49:11.866 --> 49:13.409
- [Rose] All right.

49:17.705 --> 49:18.790
- [Dot] Good morning, Rose.

49:18.873 --> 49:19.707

49:22.627 --> 49:23.878
- [Rose] Okay, what's up?

49:23.961 --> 49:26.506
- Well, he wants to
talk with me later.

49:26.589 --> 49:27.340
- Who?

49:27.423 --> 49:28.549

49:28.633 --> 49:29.759

Ooh, I can't wait.

49:33.721 --> 49:34.972

49:35.056 --> 49:37.892
- Well, we're suppose
to go out for dinner.

49:37.975 --> 49:38.976
- That's good.
- But I really think--

49:39.060 --> 49:40.061

49:40.144 --> 49:41.688
- Okay, look, I
will tell you later,

49:41.771 --> 49:46.734
but hey, I told you, it
wasn't much of a sacrifice.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.152

52:09.460 --> 52:11.045
We've got tables out here.

52:12.004 --> 52:13.923
I can't do this all by myself.

52:15.216 --> 52:15.967
- Hold on, baby.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.343
I'll be right there.

52:17.426 --> 52:18.219

52:24.934 --> 52:29.021
I'll just go to the gym
and cancel my membership.

52:29.105 --> 52:30.022
- That's a girl.

52:30.106 --> 52:31.983
- And then snap
that little twig.

52:32.066 --> 52:34.402

I've had to wait

53:10.271 --> 53:11.230
to even get my order taken?

53:11.314 --> 53:13.107
- No, and I really don't care.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.860
- What did you just say to me?

53:18.905 --> 53:22.283

53:40.551 --> 53:41.802

nasty things to me.

53:41.886 --> 53:42.803
- Well, she's in a
nasty kinda place.

53:42.887 --> 53:43.596
- No, no, no.

54:36.857 --> 54:37.692

54:38.901 --> 54:40.236
- You don't want us
to help you clean up?

54:40.319 --> 54:42.738

to close alone.

- I guess I'll be there.

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:00.150
- God is good.

01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:13.955
- Bow or no bow?

01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:14.998
- [Nancy] What do you think?

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:15.832
- No bow.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:18.168
- That looks fantastic.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.003
All right, now this
one is for your mom.

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:21.504
Wonder if she'll
guess what's in it.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:22.422
Oh, hey there.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.633
- Hey, you sure you don't mind?

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.218
- Are you kidding me?

01:12:27.302 --> 01:12:30.472
She is the best Christmas
paper wrapping person

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:31.347
in the whole planet.

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:32.182
- Way to go.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.977
- And I think after
this we might even make

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:37.395
some chocolate chip cookies.

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:38.980
- Dude, your favorite.

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:40.231
Okay, I won't be gone long.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:41.274
I love you.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.235
Be a good girl.

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:46.696
- Bye mom.
- You guys be good.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.907
- [Santa] Here,
don't tell your mom.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.992
- [Rose] I'm right here!

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.494
- [Santa] Good, are you ready?

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:53.244
- [Rose] Let's go.

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:54.079
- Let's do it.

01:12:54.162 --> 01:12:55.455
- You guys have fun.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:56.664
- Thank you, love you.

01:12:56.748 --> 01:12:59.501
- Love you, too.

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:00.335
- Let's go.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.182
- Wait a second, it's a
little bit chilly outside.

- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.951
- I've been telling
'em about you.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.244
- Well, that must be
a short conversation

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:19.038
seeing how you don't
know anything about me.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.331
- Tread lightly, Robert.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.377
- Well, there actually was.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:30.341
I told them that you're the
best artist I've seen in awhile.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.929
And I've learned more
about art from you

01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:37.390
in a short while,
then I've learned

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:41.978
from all of those pompous
critics over the past 10 years.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.565
And there's something else.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.152
I've learned that your
friends think a lot of you.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.279
Well?

01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:56.951
- Robert says
you're very special.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.163
Rare in the art world.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.498
We've seen your work
and it's fantastic.

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.377
- Robert says you're
the woman for it.

01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:08.254
- The woman for what?

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:13.301
- Rose, we want to
run our gallery.

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.179
- [Rose] Run your gallery?

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.013
- Yeah.

01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:22.143
- Run your art gallery.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:27.774
I'm flattered but I'm
just a country girl

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.525
from Fayetteville, Tennessee.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.444
A waitress.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:36.658
Okay, I'm an artist
who waits tables.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.450
- Yes.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.118
- But a waitress, y'all.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:40.411
- You don't have
to know everything.

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:42.455
I mean, we already
have a team in place.

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:48.378
- We just needed
to find the face.

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:49.712
Someone the people
can relate you.

01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:51.506
Someone that knows
and loves art.

01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:54.926
- I think y'all
got the wrong girl.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:59.013
I mean, high society,
that ain't me.

01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:01.182
No offense but the other
night at your party,

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:03.017
I was so uncomfortable.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:05.645
I'm just trying to be honest.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:10.108
- Look, Livia and I
hate those parties, too.

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:12.568
- Oh my gosh.

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:14.279
Robert knows I feel this way.

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:16.990
If I never see
another designer gown

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:20.576
stuck with a two size
too big cackling hen,

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.412
it'll be just fine with me.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:26.624
Besides girl, do I
sound like high society?

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:27.583
Really, Rose?

01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:32.714
You and little Katy are the
sweetest breathe of fresh air

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:36.467
that's blown through that
house in a long time.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.640
- And we want to open an
art gallery for everybody.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:47.854
We want to open a place where
everybody feels comfortable.

01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:52.233
We want an art gallery
where the beauty

01:16:52.317 --> 01:16:55.903
of art reflects the heart.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.198
That's you, Rose.

01:16:59.991 --> 01:17:00.700
That's you.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.417
- It's just a lot.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.506
I'd be a fool to say no.

01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:18.468
And you are quite the salesman.

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:22.597
But that diner, those people,

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.807
those friends that
you talk about.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:27.894
This might be hard
to understand,

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:32.023
but that diner has
become like our home.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:35.068
And Jack and Dot treat us
like we're their family.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.406
To just walk away from
that, I can't do that.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:45.787
Maybe I just need to go home
tonight and think about it.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.330
- [Jack] Rose, you're fired.

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:48.414
- What?

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:51.542
- I had to have a backup plan.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:57.715
- Oh my gosh.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.224
Katy, honey, honey.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:10.603
- But Mom, this one
has my name on it.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:11.437
- What?

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.029
Hey Mom, Mom, come here.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.661
- The lease is
paid up for a year

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.873
whether you take the job or not.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:45.471
It's been a dream
of mine to bring art

01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:50.268
to people who love
it and appreciate it.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:56.607
Not just for its culture
or its social prestige.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.445
But for the heart of it.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:06.617
The sweat, the inspiration,

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:12.039
the love that an artist
puts into the painting

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:17.962
of their homestead, the
sketch of a love one's face.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:25.970
Or a sculpture of a
mother's tragic loss

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:29.557
and a world's hope for eternity.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:35.771
This is a fantastic
moment in my life.

01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:43.237
And now I would to introduce
to you the new curator

01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:47.283
of the people's museum of art.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:52.830
Ladies and gentlemen,
Rose Phelps.

01:19:52.914 --> 01:19:55.541
(crowd applauds)

01:20:03.049 --> 01:20:04.050
- Thank you.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:06.886
I'm not sure I belong up here.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:13.434
I am truly honored
and truly blessed.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:23.694
Art for me as been
a form of survival,

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:27.740
of escape,

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:34.664
a way to be somewhere else,

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.918
a way to remember things
that I love and miss,

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:44.590
a way to smell, touch
things that are far way,

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:48.302
a way to bring them close again.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:57.270
Each painting has
been born of a desire,

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:03.609
of a need to remember
to live, not just exist.

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:13.119
And with art being
a gift, I thank God.

01:21:17.665 --> 01:21:20.501
There are so many people
that I owe so much to.

01:21:22.837 --> 01:21:25.047
Thank you for your
love and care.

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:31.137
Thank you for your
support and belief.

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:35.641
And for this
amazing opportunity.

01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:40.062
And for the reason to live.

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:47.236
Thank you for your trust
in me with your art.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.450
This is gonna be fun.

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:57.288
(crowd cheers)

01:21:57.371 --> 01:22:00.458
(inspirational music)

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.647
All right, baby,
you ready for bed?

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:24.190
- Almost.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.691
- Rinse out your toothbrush
and put it in your cup

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:26.609
before you come in, okay?

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:27.860
- Okay.
- All right.

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.914
(laughing)

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:41.832
Get in there, you crazy girl.

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:51.634
Babe, you're gonna have to
start folding these clothes up,

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:55.596
putting 'em away, okay?

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.847
- Mom?
- Mm-hm?

01:22:56.931 --> 01:22:58.307
- Sing Beautiful Star.

01:23:01.102 --> 01:23:02.812
- All right.

- Mom?
- Mm-hm?

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:51.360
- Do you miss the diner?

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.781
- Yeah, sure, I miss the diner.

01:23:55.865 --> 01:23:57.366
- Me too.

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.869
But we'll still get
to eat there, right?

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.747
- Absolutely, you can
always go back there.

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:08.586
Yeah, all right,
snuggle up to Drowsy.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:10.796
Get some good sleep.

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:13.299
I love you.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:14.467
- I love you.

01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:16.010
Good night, Mommy.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:17.803
- Good night, baby.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:23.893
(soft festive music)

01:25:17.488 --> 01:25:19.865
- Excuse me, I don't
think that belongs to you.

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:21.242
- Yeah, how do you know?

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:23.661
- Well, it doesn't match
your shoes for one.

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:24.870
- What is happening?

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:26.747
Dude, why do you have my purse?

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:28.707
- I ain't saying
nothing to you or you.

01:25:29.542 --> 01:25:30.960
Let go.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.963
- See, now look,
he's talking already.

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:36.090
Why don't you give the
nice lady back her purse?

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:39.385
- Thank you.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:40.803
- Apologize to the lady.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:43.597
- Sorry.

01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:47.476
- That didn't seem
very heartfelt.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.894
Now let's try it one more time.

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:50.354
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

- Oh, no, I'm just.

01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:19.409

01:32:23.247 --> 01:32:24.790
- Oh yes, what's the
name of this one?

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.793
- This is called A
View by the Lake.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.378
- I love that.

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:33.924
Speaking of view, the view
I saw not too long ago

01:32:34.007 --> 01:32:36.134
of you walking out
the door on your date.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:39.054

not a date, Livie.

01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.390
- Well, it sure looked
like a date to me.

I ain't got no time for
heartbreak right now.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:49.564
- Girl, you might wind
up with a broken heart.

01:32:49.648 --> 01:32:52.985
- If the past is any indiction
of how things will end up

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:55.988
with me and man, heart break
is written all over it.

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:56.780
Every time.

01:32:58.198 --> 01:33:00.200
- Well, I've been wrong before,

01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:01.743
but I've been right before, too.

01:33:02.953 --> 01:33:05.455
Sometimes you can't
run from romance.

01:33:05.539 --> 01:33:07.874
- So you say, so everybody says.

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:10.002
It's just so scary
though to say,

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:12.129
okay, let's shake the dust off.

01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:14.256

caution to the wind

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.299

you this question.

01:33:23.056 --> 01:33:24.891
