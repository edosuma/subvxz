WEBVTT

00:06.341 --> 00:08.134
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:14.242 --> 01:17.954
WILL: <i>We're just past 9:00 p.m. in the East</i>
<i>and we have another round of projections.</i>

01:18.037 --> 01:20.790
<i>ACN is able to project Mitt Romney will win</i>

01:20.874 --> 01:23.835
<i>the great state of Kansas</i>
<i>and its six electoral votes.</i>

01:23.918 --> 01:25.795
<i>Moving south to Louisiana, we project...</i>

01:25.879 --> 01:27.297
I'm here.

01:28.465 --> 01:31.050
I want to make sure
there's absolutely no confusion.

01:31.134 --> 01:34.637
You would go on the record.
We would use your name.

01:36.514 --> 01:39.434
I want more. I want a quote.
I'm gonna handcuff you to this thing.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.728
Did he just say, "A big prize but no surprise"?

01:41.811 --> 01:42.854
Yeah.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.273
He'll be kicking himself for that.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.275
All right, well,
we've got a decision to make here

01:47.358 --> 01:49.110
and I'll give you a heads up either way.

01:49.194 --> 01:51.696
Thank you and good luck tonight.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.740
It's as confirmed as anything has ever been.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.867
Two GOP congressmen
we can quote and identify,

01:55.950 --> 01:59.412
two senior DOJ sources
we can identify as two senior DOJ sources.

01:59.496 --> 02:00.580
- You wanted me?
- Yeah.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.332
- All right, I can explain.
- Nope.

02:02.415 --> 02:03.750
- Oh.
- Explain what?

02:04.250 --> 02:05.335
Doesn't matter.

02:06.002 --> 02:09.005
Here's what's happening.
Brody in California made a statement

02:09.088 --> 02:10.965
this morning when the polls
opened condemning Todd Akin.

02:11.049 --> 02:12.467
It's a tight race.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.968
CHARLIE: We figure he saw internal numbers

02:14.052 --> 02:17.055
suggesting he needed a bigger cushion
with women 18 to 55.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.723
MACKENZIE: So he went on
a local morning show

02:18.807 --> 02:20.099
and slid in a condemnation of Akin,

02:20.183 --> 02:23.353
but two hours ago,
Maggie found a Brody quote

02:23.436 --> 02:26.314
in a Students for America
publication from 1990.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.358
"It's a sad fact, but women cry rape

02:28.441 --> 02:31.444
"to avoid embarrassment,
to exact revenge, or just to draw attention.

02:31.528 --> 02:33.988
"If we have rape exceptions to abortion laws,

02:34.072 --> 02:36.783
"women could now cry rape
to terminate an innocent life.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.952
"We should be able to look
past the mendacity.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.329
"Children are conceived by love, not by rape."

02:41.412 --> 02:43.498
- How did you find that?
- Prayer and clean living.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.333
- Seriously, how did you find that?
- It's my job.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.793
It's my job, too, but I didn't find that.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.461
- No, you didn't.
- CHARLIE: Knock it off.

02:48.545 --> 02:51.506
So, Don calls
Brody's chief of staff to get a comment.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.341
- John Webb.
- MACKENZIE: And Webb says...

02:53.424 --> 02:55.426
Given a little time,
he might be able to feed us a better story

02:55.510 --> 02:57.470
in exchange for holding
the SFA quote till after the election.

02:57.554 --> 02:58.680
What's the better story?

02:58.763 --> 03:01.766
David Petraeus is going
to resign on Thursday.

03:01.850 --> 03:04.602
He's been having an affair
with a lieutenant colonel in the Reserves.

03:04.686 --> 03:07.689
So the question is which story do we run?

03:07.772 --> 03:10.316
- 'Cause it's one or the other.
- It's not even a contest.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.193
- Brody.
- Petraeus. Wait.

03:12.277 --> 03:15.572
It's 6:00 in the West. The polls are still open.
People are coming home from work.

03:15.655 --> 03:19.534
Almost 40% of the votes in Brody's district
are cast between 5:00 and 8:00.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.369
DON: I know, and I fully appreciate that.

03:21.452 --> 03:22.495
But this is a special circumstance.

03:22.579 --> 03:24.455
- MACKENZIE: No, it's not.
- Let me make my case.

03:24.539 --> 03:27.041
We're under siege.
If we break this Petraeus story

03:27.125 --> 03:30.128
two days before everyone else,
we'll, one, distract from our own problems,

03:30.211 --> 03:32.547
and two, earn us back
some credibility and goodwill.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.632
Does the Petraeus story
provide any information

03:34.716 --> 03:37.176
the voters should have
before they punch a ballot?

03:37.886 --> 03:38.928
It does not.

03:39.012 --> 03:40.555
Does it do anyone any good

03:40.638 --> 03:43.516
if we report the Brody quote
tomorrow instead of tonight?

03:43.683 --> 03:45.351
It would help Brody out but...

03:45.435 --> 03:47.896
Call your guy back
and tell him thanks, but no, thanks.

03:47.979 --> 03:51.900
We'll report that Petraeus is resigning
when Petraeus resigns, right?

03:51.983 --> 03:53.902
- Yeah.
- Don?

03:53.985 --> 03:55.904
I'm agreeing. Do I have to be happy about it?

03:55.987 --> 03:57.739
MACKENZIE: Put the Brody package
together for me to approve.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.824
I want to get it on the air in 15 minutes.

04:04.329 --> 04:05.496
(SIGHS)

04:08.082 --> 04:11.002
- Everything all right?
- Hmm? Yeah.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.425
Here's how things are looking right now
just after the 9:00 p.m. closings.

04:17.508 --> 04:20.470
Governor Romney is ahead
with 152 electoral votes

04:20.553 --> 04:22.430
<i>to the President's 123.</i>

04:22.513 --> 04:25.099
<i>No projections right now</i>
<i>in Arizona, New Mexico...</i>

04:25.183 --> 04:27.852
They've run out of ballots
in Racine, Wisconsin.

04:27.936 --> 04:30.271
Elliot's got it and then throw to DC.

04:30.355 --> 04:33.107
Elliot, right now
President Obama has a lead in Wisconsin,

04:33.191 --> 04:35.443
but we're hearing there are voting problems.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.946
Yeah, they've run out
of ballots in Racine, Wisconsin.

04:38.029 --> 04:40.156
They've got to get some sort
of last-minute ballot supply.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.575
Taylor Warren, is that a good sign
for the President in Wisconsin?

04:42.659 --> 04:46.037
It's a very good sign.
Racine, the whole Rust Belt area of the state,

04:46.120 --> 04:47.956
is a very big sweet spot for the President.

04:48.039 --> 04:51.000
Coming to you, Jane.
Start us off with Colorado.

04:51.084 --> 04:53.419
<i>We're gonna start with Florida.</i>

04:53.503 --> 04:54.879
Take Jane to Florida.

04:54.963 --> 04:57.840
Let's bring in Jane Barrow
and our panel in DC.

04:57.924 --> 05:00.426
Jane, what are you guys seeing in Florida?

05:00.510 --> 05:03.513
<i>There's an interesting</i>
<i>dynamic in that battleground state right now</i>

05:03.596 --> 05:05.264
<i>and I'd like to go to our panel.</i>

05:05.348 --> 05:07.141
All right, New York's
on an eight-minute break.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.310
- Don't anyone go too far.
- JAKE: And clear.

05:09.394 --> 05:10.603
TAYLOR: Okay, whew.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.314
All right, turn out, turn out.

05:13.398 --> 05:15.942
- The ground game.
- You talking to me?

05:17.068 --> 05:19.070
I wasn't really talking to anyone.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.030
I think you just described the rest of my life.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.450
How are you doing?

05:25.410 --> 05:28.246
A group called Stand By Our Troops
submitted a petition

05:28.329 --> 05:31.165
to AWM demanding Charlie and I be fired.

05:31.249 --> 05:34.627
They got 20,000 signatures.
Six and a half times the size of my hometown.

05:34.711 --> 05:35.712
I saw.

05:35.795 --> 05:38.506
Another group
called Concerned Citizens for Truth

05:38.589 --> 05:40.717
got 50,000 signatures.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.302
We hired a polling firm to gauge trust.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.096
- And?
- Nobody trusts us.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.683
Men, women, over 49, under 49,
Republicans, Democrats...

05:48.766 --> 05:51.269
Our lack of credibility
is immune to demographics.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.813
The op-eds won't stop. They're getting worse.

05:53.896 --> 05:57.650
And I'm concerned this
is finally what's going to kill Charlie Skinner.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.445
Schadenfreude's been made very convenient.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.155
Hmm. Yeah.

06:04.282 --> 06:07.160
You know, I hate to seem like I'm circling,

06:07.243 --> 06:09.620
but I'm setting up a media consulting firm

06:09.704 --> 06:12.248
and I wanted to get
your blessing to approach Jim Harper.

06:12.832 --> 06:15.251
- About what?
- About joining the firm.

06:15.877 --> 06:18.713
He hates me,
but if I only worked with people who liked me,

06:18.796 --> 06:21.132
I'd have to make my dog Howard a partner.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.759
I'm lost.

06:22.842 --> 06:26.262
There's gonna be a land rush
as soon as you guys announce.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.930
There's a lot of talent here.

06:28.014 --> 06:31.059
Jim just renewed his contract
a few months ago.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.519
It's in the air supply around here

06:33.603 --> 06:36.606
that senior staff is resigning over Genoa.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.733
Charlie is resigning and I'm resigning.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.193
But as of 1:35 this morning,

06:40.276 --> 06:42.779
Leona Lansing won't even
accept our resignations.

06:42.862 --> 06:45.156
Where did you hear
senior staff was resigning?

06:45.239 --> 06:47.533
- Maybe I shouldn't say.
- Where did you hear that?

06:49.202 --> 06:50.620
From the senior staff.

06:56.084 --> 06:57.752
- I make friends everywhere I go.
- (DOOR OPENS)

06:57.835 --> 06:59.170
(DOOR CLOSES)

07:00.046 --> 07:02.340
I want the senior staff in the studio right now.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.842
- We have seven minutes back.
- Right now.

07:05.510 --> 07:06.928
(DOOR OPENING)

07:07.428 --> 07:10.348
<i>The mood here is still upbeat.</i>
<i>They like the internal exits they're seeing.</i>

07:10.431 --> 07:13.601
They're not troubled that Obama isn't losing
in a single state he needs to win?

07:13.684 --> 07:15.603
They like what they're seeing
in Ohio and Florida.

07:15.686 --> 07:16.854
<i>What are they seeing?</i>

07:16.938 --> 07:18.981
Honey, I'm starting to get
funny looks from people here.

07:19.065 --> 07:21.400
- They know I'm Skyping with ACN.
- You're Skyping with me.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.111
No one can see or hear us.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.612
<i>- Hey, Hallie!</i>
- Hey, Maggie.

07:24.946 --> 07:27.365
<i>Will wants senior staff in the studio.</i>

07:27.448 --> 07:28.991
JIM: <i>I'll be right there.</i>

07:29.784 --> 07:32.453
HALLIE: <i>It's mostly the bloggers</i>
<i>who don't want me helping out old media.</i>

07:32.537 --> 07:35.123
You know, why don't you tell
new media that old media

07:35.206 --> 07:37.166
has got a combined audience
of about 80 million tonight?

07:37.250 --> 07:40.044
I will, but new media
will probably respond by saying

07:40.128 --> 07:42.213
that the report you just gave
about Racine, Wisconsin,

07:42.296 --> 07:43.798
running out of ballots came off Twitter.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.342
<i>Then you should reply</i>
<i>by telling new media to bite me</i>

07:46.425 --> 07:47.844
<i>and my accountability and professionalism.</i>

07:47.927 --> 07:49.846
Can you get someone else to do this?

07:49.929 --> 07:52.765
By the way, a little while ago we called
the Michigan First for Dan Benishek.

07:52.849 --> 07:55.351
If you were thinking
of posting something about it, I'd hold off.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.436
- Why?
- I accidentally called the wrong race.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.397
- I meant Mississippi.
<i>- You didn't retract it?</i>

07:59.480 --> 08:01.816
Our decision desk
is 100% confident he's going to win.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.943
<i>- Then why can't you call it?</i>
- They're not confident enough.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.236
<i>You should really retract it.</i>

08:05.319 --> 08:06.779
If you were us tonight,
would you retract something

08:06.863 --> 08:08.656
you didn't absolutely have to?

08:08.739 --> 08:10.575
<i>- No.</i>
- I'm going all in on Benishek.

08:10.783 --> 08:12.410
- Hang on.
<i>- They're waiting for me in the studio.</i>

08:12.493 --> 08:14.328
I think she cut her own hair.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.874
<i>Tonight's really not the night...</i>

08:17.957 --> 08:20.543
Cutting off your own hair, that's alarming.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.340
- Any chance this can wait?
- No.

08:26.424 --> 08:27.508
Jim's on his way.

08:27.592 --> 08:29.594
I'd like to announce
something in the meantime.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.930
I was supposed to donate a signed copy of
my book for the Sandy auction

08:33.014 --> 08:36.350
and I went to see my parents last weekend
and forgot to leave the book.

08:36.434 --> 08:38.936
Gary, meaning well, signed a copy of the book

08:39.020 --> 08:40.980
forging my signature
and writing the inscription.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.481
- In German.
- Almost.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.817
In German the words for enjoy
and shred are a lot alike.

08:44.901 --> 08:46.402
They're nothing alike, but that's not the point.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.362
Take your time getting to the point,
because as you can see,

08:48.446 --> 08:50.531
- nothing else is happening right now.
- We've got five minutes.

08:50.615 --> 08:53.492
We do not have five minutes.
The producers don't have five minutes.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.120
My point is that
someone bought the book for a lot of money

08:56.204 --> 08:58.664
and Neal's dropping
everything to help me find out who it was

08:58.748 --> 09:02.168
so that I can give him
or her a real signed copy of the book.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.129
So if there's anyone who was at the fundraiser

09:05.213 --> 09:07.757
- or maybe knows the person who...
- Excuse me.

09:08.299 --> 09:09.467
You're dropping everything?

09:09.550 --> 09:12.470
No, I'm still very much doing my job.
Except for right now.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.889
And when I'm trying to fix
your Wikipedia page.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.183
Oh, forget that. Drop it, it's stupid.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.352
- Everybody's here?
- Yes.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.313
Let's go around the room and everybody
tell something about themselves.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.273
- Do you need to go back to the control room?
- Yes.

09:24.357 --> 09:25.650
Go.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.820
- Fix the page. Get it fixed.
- Copy.

09:29.904 --> 09:32.573
I don't know what the hell
you guys are thinking about doing,

09:32.657 --> 09:34.075
- but you're not doing it.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

09:34.158 --> 09:38.454
Last night, Charlie, Mac, and I
offered our resignations to Mrs. Lansing.

09:38.537 --> 09:42.291
She refused to accept them, believing that
the right thing to do was to stand by us.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.544
Charlie is working hard on Reese
to get him to change his mother's mind.

09:45.670 --> 09:48.422
The reason, whole reason,
we're trying to resign

09:48.506 --> 09:50.967
is to allow the rest of you to continue

09:51.050 --> 09:53.386
to do what we started
without the burden of Genoa.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.389
Elliot would take my job.
Don would take Mac's.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.016
Sloan would anchor 10:00
and Jim would be her EP.

09:59.183 --> 10:02.270
So I don't want to hear any more rumors
about the rest of you resigning.

10:02.979 --> 10:04.647
- Is that clear?
- No.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.565
- It's not clear?
- No, it's clear.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.943
- We're saying no.
- No to what?

10:09.026 --> 10:11.279
If Leona accepts your resignations,
we're resigning, too.

10:11.362 --> 10:12.905
Everyone who was involved with Genoa.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.865
I'm not going to accept your resignations.

10:14.949 --> 10:17.827
Due respect, but if Leona accepts yours,
you're not going to be in a position...

10:17.910 --> 10:19.912
DON: We gave you a bad story.
It's our responsibility.

10:19.996 --> 10:22.039
There are principles of...

10:22.331 --> 10:24.959
Principle here and character
and responsibility.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.627
<i>Who put all this in your head?</i>

10:26.711 --> 10:29.213
DON: <i>You did. Now can we go back to work?</i>

10:34.552 --> 10:35.970
You expect me to get choked up?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.471
Meeting's over. Two minutes back.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.976
(DOOR OPENING)

10:48.357 --> 10:49.358
(DOOR CLOSING)

10:49.442 --> 10:51.402
I think you insulted them
a little by not assuming

10:51.485 --> 10:53.321
they'd stand behind you and Charlie and Mac.

10:53.404 --> 10:54.655
Why do you think that?

10:54.739 --> 10:56.741
Because you insulted me a little.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.413
- Charlie. Hi.
- Oh, hi.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.999
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Charlie.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.251
Charlie, a woman in Mesa, Arizona,

11:07.335 --> 11:10.421
ran over her husband with their car
because he didn't vote for Romney.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.673
- Can I have a moment?
- Did you hear what I just said?

11:12.757 --> 11:14.091
- No.
- REBECCA: He's in the hospital.

11:14.175 --> 11:17.178
They were in a parking lot.
She was chasing him around a light pole.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.765
He tried to make a run for it
and she pinned him at the curb.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.392
Here's what I find strange about this.

11:23.476 --> 11:27.355
First of all,
it's not like the husband voted for Obama.

11:27.438 --> 11:29.732
He just didn't vote for Romney. He didn't vote.

11:29.815 --> 11:33.652
And second, isn't Romney gonna win the vote
in Arizona by like 200% anyway?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.863
Yeah, but you don't think the strange part

11:35.946 --> 11:38.866
is the wife driving over
her husband with a car?

11:38.949 --> 11:40.242
Well, she's pregnant.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.619
Where are you getting this from?

11:41.994 --> 11:43.245
- Twitter.
- Twitter.

11:43.329 --> 11:45.706
All right, can I have just a second?

11:45.790 --> 11:47.249
Sure.

11:47.666 --> 11:51.087
A decision has to be made
before the court clerk's office

11:51.170 --> 11:53.214
opens at 9:00 tomorrow.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.800
I appreciate everything you said last night.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.552
- I was high last night.
- I know. You told us.

11:58.636 --> 11:59.929
But then I got a good night's sleep

12:00.012 --> 12:02.264
and an early morning swim
and a full day's work.

12:02.348 --> 12:04.767
And then I changed
and came here and got high again.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.352
- God damn it.
- It's marketing.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.978
They got a stash.

12:08.062 --> 12:09.397
I mean, I don't know how they do it.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.234
I think they grow their own in, like,
the Galapagos Islands or something.

12:13.317 --> 12:16.070
And I want to get
the Allman Brothers back together.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.532
Rebecca says that
it's your intention to sue us if we resign.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.076
For breach of contract, yes.
Hey, you want some champagne?

12:22.159 --> 12:25.621
No. For two months, there's been a mob
shouting for our resignations.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.124
- And the mob is right.
- Are you sure they're not just loud?

12:28.207 --> 12:31.419
What does it matter? They'll keep shouting
until Will and I leave the building.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.880
And if we don't leave the building,
what will that do to everyone else?

12:34.964 --> 12:37.967
From what I understand,
if I accept your resignations,

12:38.050 --> 12:40.678
there won't be anyone left
except the DC bureau

12:40.761 --> 12:42.930
because those guys want your jobs.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.599
Will and I will convince senior staff to stay.

12:45.683 --> 12:46.934
I'm not worried about that.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.062
Here's why you have to let Dantana's lawyers

12:50.146 --> 12:53.357
know you're gonna settle
before papers are filed in the morning.

12:53.441 --> 12:56.193
A diary will be made available to any
reporter who wants to read it...

12:56.277 --> 12:58.571
- Which will be every reporter.
- ...of the internal operations of ACN.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.949
And AWM and that diary
will be written by lawyers

13:02.032 --> 13:03.951
whose only objective is to make us look silly.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.662
I don't feel silly. You want to split a pizza?

13:06.745 --> 13:08.456
(LOUDLY) Can you understand me right now?

13:08.539 --> 13:10.541
Well, when you speak at that volume,
I think everyone can.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.252
I drove them into this fucking nightmare.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.254
I led, they followed.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.506
And it's like I led them to <i>Cape Fear</i>

13:17.590 --> 13:20.134
'cause everyone we've pissed off,

13:20.217 --> 13:22.470
every congressman, every reporter,

13:22.553 --> 13:24.138
every citizen journalist...

13:24.221 --> 13:26.682
I understand the reality.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.434
You know who I am.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.270
Reese agrees with us.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.149
The irony that it's come down
to you and Reese agreeing.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.986
- Your son and I seldom agree.
- You disrespect him, Charlie.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.739
- He's given me reasons to.
- No, no, he hasn't.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.742
He's given you reasons to disagree with him,
but not to disrespect him.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.368
Well, we're not disagreeing now.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.913
He's thinking very clearly about this.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.165
He's being a smart executive.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.584
And now is exactly
the right time to listen to him.

13:56.045 --> 13:59.298
Well, I'm doing a lot more
than listening to him.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.800
I'm letting him make the decision.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.846
- You are?
- Yeah.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.891
- Leona, come on.
- Reese is making the decision.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.559
He went out to take a walk.

14:11.769 --> 14:13.521
- Why?
- Clear his head.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.022
- I meant...
- Maybe get a panini.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.358
I meant why are you letting
Reese make the decision?

14:17.441 --> 14:21.445
'Cause I'm not really sure Elizabeth Windsor
is the world's greatest mom.

14:21.529 --> 14:23.531
I mean, why doesn't she just
give her son the throne?

14:23.614 --> 14:27.201
On the other hand,
I think being queen is what keeps her alive.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.870
But doesn't she want
to be alive to see her son be king?

14:29.954 --> 14:31.705
Except that that's not how it works.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.667
It's prince by birth, king by death.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.043
Yet...

14:36.126 --> 14:38.045
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about right now?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.130
Don't think I do, no.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.841
But I want to see how Reese handles this.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.136
He's already told us how he's gonna...

14:46.554 --> 14:47.555
Okay.

14:50.766 --> 14:51.976
Okay.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.604
I'm relieved.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.857
I can tell.

15:01.402 --> 15:03.028
Enjoy the party.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.079
- (CLATTERING)
- BOTH: Oh!

15:12.162 --> 15:15.791
Oh, my God! I'm sorry. Are you all right?

15:16.041 --> 15:17.835
- I'm sorry.
- It was my fault.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.545
I wasn't looking. Did I hurt you?

15:19.628 --> 15:20.671
No, no, I'm fine.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.507
Have we met? You look familiar.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.926
I'm Maggie Jordan's roommate.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.261
- Sure.
- I'm Lisa.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.512
Lisa.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.099
I'm sorry, Lisa. Are you all okay?

15:32.182 --> 15:34.393
- Yes.
- Okay.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.896
Oh, Mr. Skinner, could I ask you a favor?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.858
Would you mind not mentioning to Jim Harper
that I'm working up here tonight?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.235
Yeah, sure. Why would I mention it to Jim?

15:43.319 --> 15:45.237
'Cause you guys were... Got it.

15:45.321 --> 15:46.697
Thank you.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.868
We're ready to make an important projection

15:50.951 --> 15:53.662
at 9:25 with 27% of the vote counted.

15:53.746 --> 15:57.124
ACN is projecting that Pennsylvania
will be won by the President.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.668
<i>Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state</i>

15:59.752 --> 16:02.963
<i>which was won by the President four years</i>
<i>ago, will stay in his column.</i>

16:03.047 --> 16:06.258
<i>Suzannah Marquez is on the scene for us</i>
<i>at Obama headquarters in Chicago.</i>

16:06.342 --> 16:08.469
<i>Suzannah, was this much</i>
<i>of a surprise where you are?</i>

16:08.552 --> 16:11.263
SUZANNAH: <i>Will, they're not surprised,</i>
<i>but they're certainly relieved.</i>

16:11.347 --> 16:14.224
<i>This was a state President Obama</i>
<i>was determined to hold</i>

16:14.308 --> 16:17.061
<i>against a late push</i>
<i>from Governor Romney to take it.</i>

16:17.144 --> 16:19.563
<i>There's also something</i>
<i>instructive in these numbers.</i>

16:19.730 --> 16:24.109
<i>According to senior campaign officials</i>
<i>I've been speaking to all day...</i>

16:24.193 --> 16:25.819
- Is that from you?
- Mmm-mmm.

16:28.447 --> 16:31.659
<i>And that's a pattern they said they've</i>
<i>been seeing in a number of states today.</i>

16:31.742 --> 16:34.662
<i>But, of course, the night is early</i>
<i>and we'll have much more later.</i>

16:35.037 --> 16:36.830
<i>- Will?</i>
<i>- Thank you, Suzannah Marquez.</i>

16:36.914 --> 16:38.874
<i>- We'll be hearing more from you as the...</i>
- Battleground update.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.211
...night moves on. Checking in
with our other battleground states,

16:42.294 --> 16:45.964
in Florida with 84% of the vote in,
the race is as close as it gets

16:46.048 --> 16:48.175
with the President holding a 50-49 lead.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.177
- It looks like...
- It's close.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.720
Hit refresh.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.683
It just got closer. 657 votes.

16:57.351 --> 17:00.312
WILL: In the state of Massachusetts,
ACN is projecting that...

17:00.396 --> 17:02.272
- Kathy?
- Very busy now, Jim.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.691
Can I see you one second?

17:03.774 --> 17:05.484
- I'll have to shield my eyes.
- Go ahead.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.863
I'm not allowed to see other networks.

17:09.947 --> 17:12.282
Just look down. Aim your gaze at the floor.

17:12.366 --> 17:15.661
The Michigan First is getting tighter.
Benishek is only up by 600 votes.

17:15.744 --> 17:16.954
657.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.707
There was a moment in the race
when it was one to nothing, right?

17:19.790 --> 17:23.168
- That's not... Yes, but...
- And then the second vote got counted.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.962
- You're still confident he's going to win?
- Yes.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.672
And you're just as confident
he's going to win.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.215
51-49 red.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.134
- Or, if you want to be more exact...
- I do.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.345
- 50.6 to 49.4.
- That's literally as close as a race can be.

17:33.429 --> 17:35.055
- That's why we haven't called it.
- We did call it.

17:35.139 --> 17:37.266
- You called it.
- What's the abbreviation for Michigan?

17:37.349 --> 17:39.601
- M-I.
- What's the abbreviation for Mississippi?

17:39.685 --> 17:40.811
M-I-S-S.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.855
Okay, you're not here
as an abbreviation expert.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.399
I'm 100% confident in those abbreviations.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.900
Go back in your lair.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.110
- TAMARA: Jim.
- Yeah?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.237
TAMARA: Rachel Corey is on the phone
and wants to talk to you.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.781
She's a pollster with the Benishek campaign
in the Michigan First.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.575
Here it comes.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.285
Tam, will you transfer
that call to Maggie's line?

17:56.368 --> 17:58.162
- Yeah.
- (PHONE BEPING)

17:58.829 --> 18:00.330
(PHONE RINGING)

18:00.831 --> 18:02.499
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

18:03.625 --> 18:04.835
This is Jim Harper.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.630
<i>Jim, this is Rachel Corey</i>
<i>with Dan Benishek's campaign in Michigan.</i>

18:08.714 --> 18:11.425
- Congratulations!
<i>- That's why I'm on the phone.</i>

18:11.508 --> 18:14.344
<i>ACN called the race a while ago,</i>
<i>but no one else has.</i>

18:14.428 --> 18:16.221
Well, I can't speak for the other networks,

18:16.346 --> 18:18.557
but ACN has the congressman
holding his seat.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.768
<i>Our numbers show he's only up by 600 votes.</i>

18:20.851 --> 18:23.312
- 657.
- 632.

18:23.395 --> 18:24.813
<i>What the hell is going on, Jim?</i>

18:24.897 --> 18:26.815
<i>Do I send my guy out</i>
<i>to make a victory speech?</i>

18:27.065 --> 18:28.150
(MOUTHS)

18:28.233 --> 18:29.526
I would.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.528
<i>Look, I don't want to kick</i>
<i>you guys when you're down,</i>

18:31.612 --> 18:35.282
<i>but you haven't had the most</i>
<i>awesome history of being right lately.</i>

18:35.365 --> 18:39.495
Well, first, you can't bounce
the words history and lately

18:39.578 --> 18:41.121
off each other in the same sentence.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.416
Also, in my entire time here
covering national elections,

18:44.500 --> 18:46.126
ACN hasn't missed a single call.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.878
<i>How many elections have you been there for?</i>

18:48.003 --> 18:49.254
This is my second.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.757
<i>- Did we win the election or not?</i>
- You did.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.550
<i>Then why has no one else called it?</i>

18:53.634 --> 18:56.261
You're forcing me to brag, but it may just be

18:56.345 --> 18:58.472
that we have better people
working the numbers.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.266
<i>You won't be offended if we wait</i>
<i>until someone else has called it, will you?</i>

19:01.391 --> 19:03.560
No, ma'am. I am a little offended.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.521
- Even though you're lying?
- She doesn't know that.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.356
- We've got a problem upstairs.
- At the party?

19:07.439 --> 19:09.733
The guests were supposed to hand over
their phones and someone didn't,

19:09.817 --> 19:11.652
because they tweeted a picture.

19:11.735 --> 19:14.321
There are people up there who are hearing
information we don't want leaked.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.491
And also this is a shot of Charlie

19:17.574 --> 19:19.159
on the floor with broken champagne glasses,

19:19.243 --> 19:21.203
which isn't the best optic for us right now.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.664
- I don't have the muscle to get security to...
- That's Lisa.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.417
- Kneeling on the floor, that's Lisa.
- That is Lisa.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.504
She didn't want you to know
she was here tonight.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.215
She's been working
for a caterer to earn extra money.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.259
Why didn't she want me
to know she was here?

19:37.678 --> 19:39.179
This is where I'm gonna check out.

19:39.263 --> 19:41.473
But someone upstairs
has a phone and they're using it.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.771
You know, it might be a good time
for you guys to patch things up.

19:47.855 --> 19:50.357
You really think this is a good time?

19:52.526 --> 19:55.028
What if none of us are here tomorrow?

19:57.656 --> 19:59.533
599.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.787
Checking back in with our analysts.

20:03.871 --> 20:06.039
Taylor, you've been looking over
the exits and working your phone.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.332
Tell us what you're seeing and hearing.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.334
We're seeing movement in Florida.

20:09.418 --> 20:12.462
The last exit polls showed
Mitt Romney up by three.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.507
The latest show the President up by one.
So that's a fluid race.

20:15.591 --> 20:17.718
<i>But senior campaign sources in Boston</i>

20:17.801 --> 20:19.761
<i>are telling me</i>
<i>they like the precinct breakdown.</i>

20:19.845 --> 20:21.555
WILL: <i>The Romney people</i>
<i>still feeling good about Florida?</i>

20:21.638 --> 20:22.931
- Take us to break.
- TAYLOR: <i>Florida and Ohio.</i>

20:23.015 --> 20:25.559
And hopefully we'll be able
to bring those calls to you soon.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.811
But right now, what we know
is that Pennsylvania,

20:27.895 --> 20:29.313
the first of the big contested states...

20:29.396 --> 20:31.523
- Play in and stand by animation.
- Standing.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.734
WILL: <i>Stay tuned for</i>
<i>more of ACN's continuing coverage</i>

20:33.817 --> 20:35.861
<i>of Election Night 2012.</i>

20:37.821 --> 20:38.864
We're out.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.158
- Two minutes back.
- That's two and no change.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.660
Will, we're ready to call
the House for the Republicans.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.454
All right, I'll take care of things out here.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.539
- You do it in there.
- Take care of what things?

20:47.623 --> 20:49.416
Come sit in this chair.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.209
Why?

20:51.293 --> 20:53.378
When we come back from commercial,
you're gonna call the House

20:53.462 --> 20:55.547
for the Republicans
and go to Sloan for the breakdown.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.133
ELLIOT: <i>Where are you going?</i>
WILL: <i>I'm taking a break.</i>

20:58.842 --> 21:00.135
ELLIOT: <i>What do you mean, you're taking...</i>

21:00.218 --> 21:02.471
I want our audience
to get used to seeing you break big news.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.931
That's not gonna be necessary.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.766
- Take the chair.
- No.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.018
Then there's gonna be a camera
pointed at an empty chair.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.394
Oh, fuck. Will!

21:14.066 --> 21:15.275
(DOOR OPENING)

21:15.359 --> 21:17.152
- Don.
- Yeah?

21:17.235 --> 21:18.987
We're gonna call the House after the break.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.656
Yeah, we've got Boehner, Cantor, and Pelosi,

21:20.739 --> 21:22.741
but we have to wait in line for a while,
so you'll need to vamp.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.910
You'll need to vamp.
I'm gonna step out of the room.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.745
- HERB: Sixty seconds back.
- What?

21:26.828 --> 21:28.580
You've got your cards,
you've got your producers,

21:28.664 --> 21:30.582
you've got Elliot at the desk.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.417
What's happening right now?

21:32.501 --> 21:34.461
We just want to show Reese and Leona
you guys are good at this.

21:34.544 --> 21:37.381
- You guys are good at this.
- See you in eight minutes.

21:38.715 --> 21:39.883
(DOOR CLOSING)

21:39.967 --> 21:42.135
The Republicans are keeping the House.
Let's get that graphic up.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.513
- G-0445 standing.
- DON: Elliot.

21:44.846 --> 21:45.889
<i>I'm here.</i>

21:45.973 --> 21:47.557
You're gonna ask Sloan
how we're able to make that call.

21:47.641 --> 21:48.642
Copy.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.895
Sloan, most of the competitive House races
were in states where polls closed at 8:00.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.981
Republicans were ahead in 12,
Democrats in three,

21:54.064 --> 21:56.066
and that's how we're able to call it.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.069
- You copy?
<i>- This is getting out of hand.</i>

21:59.194 --> 22:01.738
Ah. Don't worry about that right now, okay?

22:02.614 --> 22:03.907
Copy.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.832
ELLIOT: <i>Welcome back.</i>
<i>We are ready to make a big call.</i>

22:11.915 --> 22:15.669
<i>ACN's ready to project</i>
<i>that the Republican Party</i>

22:15.752 --> 22:18.338
<i>will be the majority party</i>
<i>in the House of Representatives</i>

22:18.422 --> 22:19.381
<i>for at least two more years.</i>

22:19.464 --> 22:20.841
So far, so good.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.635
<i>ACN is projecting</i>
<i>at this time that the Republicans</i>

22:23.719 --> 22:25.721
<i>will hold on to the majority in the House.</i>

22:25.804 --> 22:28.432
<i>We'll be speaking with</i>
<i>Majority Leader Eric Cantor in just a moment.</i>

22:28.515 --> 22:30.475
<i>But before we do, Sloan Sabbith,</i>

22:30.559 --> 22:33.353
<i>you've been reviewing all the information</i>
<i>as far as the House is concerned.</i>

22:33.437 --> 22:35.022
<i>You've been speaking with our decision desk.</i>

22:35.105 --> 22:36.440
- (SIGHS)
<i>- How are we able to call this?</i>

22:36.523 --> 22:37.691
SLOAN: <i>Well, Elliot, the Democrats</i>

22:37.774 --> 22:40.444
<i>needed a net gain of 25 seats</i>
<i>to take the House</i>

22:40.527 --> 22:43.613
<i>and 20 of the most competitive races</i>
<i>closed at 8:00.</i>

22:43.697 --> 22:47.701
I was wrong to think
the reason you weren't firing me was vanity.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.122
I was wrong to think the reason

22:52.205 --> 22:54.041
you weren't firing me
was that it would look bad.

22:54.124 --> 22:56.293
I'm sorry for that.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.463
You want your job back?

22:59.546 --> 23:00.881
(CHUCKLES)

23:01.465 --> 23:04.009
I don't think it'll make
that much difference now.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.720
Charlie told me Leona
is letting Reese make the decision.

23:06.803 --> 23:07.888
Yeah.

23:09.848 --> 23:14.186
I tried to explain it
my first day here the second I saw you.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.896
Do you remember?

23:15.979 --> 23:18.398
I was hung up on him
because he had rejected me.

23:18.482 --> 23:19.941
That's normal.

23:21.068 --> 23:22.944
I liked that he hated I was dating you.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.613
We weren't just dating.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.448
Later. We weren't just dating later.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.825
At the beginning we were, though.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.495
And I was using you to get,

23:32.370 --> 23:33.413
you know.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.416
And then I fell in love with you

23:36.500 --> 23:38.668
and I never saw him again.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.338
And if I hadn't told you,

23:42.839 --> 23:44.716
you'd never have known.

23:45.383 --> 23:46.885
So why did you tell me?

23:46.968 --> 23:48.553
If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't,

23:48.637 --> 23:52.140
but I had never
been in a relationship as serious as ours

23:52.224 --> 23:54.059
and I thought it was
what I was supposed to do.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.269
You sure you didn't tell me
'cause you wanted to break up?

23:56.353 --> 23:58.021
Oh, fuck you.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.731
- It's a reasonable...
- Yeah, I'm sure.

23:59.815 --> 24:02.651
Are you sure you're not
just a massive bag of douche?

24:02.734 --> 24:05.112
'Cause let me tell you something,
it's just plain weird

24:05.195 --> 24:07.114
that you were prepared to marry me,

24:07.197 --> 24:08.573
that you'd bought a ring,

24:08.657 --> 24:11.785
but were unwilling to read any of my e-mails

24:11.868 --> 24:13.578
or answer any of my calls.

24:13.662 --> 24:16.206
Yeah, I'm sorry for this,
but the ring was a practical joke.

24:17.541 --> 24:20.085
You were having the staff vet me, remember?

24:20.168 --> 24:22.671
I knew you were gonna find the offer
from when we were together

24:22.754 --> 24:24.381
for me to do something on the West Coast.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.967
I knew you were gonna
come into the office waving it and saying,

24:27.050 --> 24:28.802
"Ah-ha!
You were never as serious as you said,

24:28.885 --> 24:31.012
"'cause if you were,
you'd have told me about a job

24:31.096 --> 24:33.223
"you were considering
on the other side of the country."

24:33.306 --> 24:35.392
And that's what happened.

24:37.561 --> 24:41.231
You know, I heard the ring
was a practical joke...

24:43.233 --> 24:45.652
And then I didn't hear anything after that.

24:46.027 --> 24:48.071
It wasn't a joke.
It was a rejoinder. It wasn't a joke.

24:48.155 --> 24:50.073
You took out a ring and showed it to me

24:50.157 --> 24:53.326
as proof that your intention
had been to marry me.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.661
I bought the ring that morning.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.330
Scott's assistant did.

24:59.291 --> 25:03.461
Your agent's assistant went to Tiffany's
and bought the ring that morning?

25:03.545 --> 25:05.922
Yes. I'm sorry.
And you were never supposed to know.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.800
So I get the irony and I am really sorry.

25:09.009 --> 25:12.345
That ring had to have cost
a quarter of a million dollars.

25:13.180 --> 25:16.391
I'm not really sure.
We returned it that afternoon.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.685
I asked them to get a nice one.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.562
You once described a ring
you saw in a movie.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.189
- Okay.
- Mac.

25:22.272 --> 25:24.149
You know, no kidding. I'm gonna step away.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.692
- Hang on.
- Because the thing is I'm serious.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.777
I feel like I'm gonna hit you
and you have to be back on the air.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.863
- You're not going to hit me.
- I'm worried that I am.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.406
And I'm the executive producer of the show.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.325
I can defend my...

25:36.119 --> 25:37.412
Stand on the other side of the room.

25:37.621 --> 25:39.748
- This is stupid.
- There is a reasonable chance,

25:39.831 --> 25:41.666
a credible threat that I'm gonna hit you

25:41.750 --> 25:43.501
and I don't want you to have a bloody lip

25:43.585 --> 25:44.794
when we come back from commercial.

25:44.878 --> 25:45.962
That should make sense to you.

25:50.050 --> 25:53.428
Like I said, if I ever thought
there was a chance you'd find out...

25:53.511 --> 25:55.180
You just told me!

26:04.648 --> 26:06.483
I brutally hurt you and that's a fact.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.527
And facts don't change. But in my lifetime...

26:11.863 --> 26:14.324
I've never done it intentionally.

26:18.954 --> 26:20.330
I'm sorry.

26:32.342 --> 26:35.512
Recap the House and then look at Colorado
when we come back.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.099
(DOOR CLOSES)

26:39.808 --> 26:41.059
Yeah.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.483
- Did you find out anything?
- Yes.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.568
A woman at the auction
management company

26:50.652 --> 26:54.364
was moved by your story and a little
concerned about going to jail for fraud,

26:54.447 --> 26:56.950
so she was happy to fax over
the name and contact information

26:57.033 --> 26:59.869
of the person who bought the forged book,
but you're not gonna be happy.

27:00.203 --> 27:01.955
Was it bought by an inmate?

27:02.038 --> 27:04.624
I have a small, slightly disturbed
following among white-collar criminals.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.668
The book was bought by Sidney Falco.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.796
- I don't know who that is.
- It's Tony Curtis.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.090
Sidney Falco is a character
from <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

27:13.049 --> 27:14.175
The highest bid was anonymous?

27:14.259 --> 27:15.593
All the bids are anonymous.

27:15.969 --> 27:17.137
Joe Gillis is <i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

27:17.220 --> 27:18.763
Walter Neff from <i>Double Indemnity.</i>

27:18.847 --> 27:20.640
Archibald Craven from <i>The Secret Garden.</i>

27:20.724 --> 27:22.267
SLOAN: I don't understand this at all.

27:22.350 --> 27:26.187
Someone wanted to create
the impression of a bidding war.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.605
So a total of nobody bid on the book?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.816
Except Sidney Falco from
<i>Sweet Smell of Success</i>

27:29.899 --> 27:32.152
who, for some reason,
bid himself up with other fictional characters.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.238
Who cares?
Someone gave $1,000 to Sandy relief

27:35.322 --> 27:36.573
and they think they have your signature.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.408
- I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
- You're at the bottom.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.743
- There are clues here.
- I don't think so.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.119
- There could be clues.
- There aren't.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.746
And you don't want to start
looking for anagrams...

27:42.871 --> 27:44.622
Let's start looking for
anagrams of Sidney Falco

27:44.706 --> 27:46.666
and <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

27:46.750 --> 27:48.043
Okay.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.506
REBECCA: I got your text.

27:53.590 --> 27:55.675
- I've decided to countersue Jerry.
- Of course.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.677
- I'm fighting back.
- What are you suing him for?

27:57.761 --> 27:59.888
- To fight back.
- I meant exactly what are you suing him for?

27:59.971 --> 28:01.556
- You ready?
- I'm sorry?

28:01.639 --> 28:03.350
- I said you ready?
- Give it to me.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.477
Intentional affliction of emotional distress.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.395
- How do you even know?
- I googled it.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.189
- There are four elements.
- One, he acted intentionally.

28:09.272 --> 28:10.482
By doctoring the tape.

28:10.565 --> 28:12.484
Two, his conduct
was extreme and outrageous.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.986
- He doctored the tape.
- Three, you suffered distress.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.446
I am in extreme distress.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.907
And four, his act caused your distress.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.950
He doctored the motherfucking tape, Rebecca.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.119
- You sound upset.
- Do I?

28:23.912 --> 28:26.539
He doctored the tape and he gets to sue us?

28:26.623 --> 28:29.250
I gave him a bad job recommendation
'cause he doctored the tape

28:29.334 --> 28:31.211
and he gets to sue me?

28:31.294 --> 28:33.296
The people who want tort reform,
they got a point.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.547
Yes.

28:34.631 --> 28:36.883
The things you're allowed
to sue for and be taken seriously.

28:36.966 --> 28:40.720
And so we come face-to-face
with just how stupid lawyers worry we are.

28:40.804 --> 28:41.930
I lost you in the middle of that.

28:42.013 --> 28:44.557
You know what it says
on a box of chocolate pudding mix?

28:44.641 --> 28:47.268
"Caution, pudding will get hot when heated."

28:47.352 --> 28:50.688
Go to a hotel, you know what it says
on the shower cap in the bathroom?

28:50.772 --> 28:51.856
"Fits one head."

28:51.940 --> 28:54.275
- You wear a shower cap?
- I read.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.236
And I'm dying to know the suit

28:56.319 --> 28:58.405
that prompted lawyers
to insist on the shower cap directions.

28:58.488 --> 28:59.989
Look at the box your iron came in.

29:00.073 --> 29:03.451
It says, "Warning,
do not iron clothes while wearing them."

29:03.535 --> 29:06.121
Do we really
have to slow down for these people?

29:06.204 --> 29:08.498
Leona's leaving the decision to Reese.

29:10.667 --> 29:11.793
I know.

29:15.547 --> 29:17.173
That's not what you wanted.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.845
I don't know what I want.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.271
I want to keep doing the news.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.731
Here.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.776
With Elliot for Charlie.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.778
I want to keep arguing with Mac and Will.

29:38.862 --> 29:42.031
I want Dantana
to iron his clothes while wearing them.

29:42.115 --> 29:43.116
(LAUGHS)

29:47.537 --> 29:49.372
Could I get another
Grey Goose on the rocks with three olives?

29:49.497 --> 29:50.498
Sure.

29:50.582 --> 29:51.624
And you can just bring me
some more champagne

29:51.708 --> 29:53.751
if it hasn't all been soaked up by your clothes.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.045
- No, there's plenty more.
- Just joking with you.

29:56.129 --> 29:58.173
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

30:01.009 --> 30:02.010
Don't shoot.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.472
Charlie Skinner
wasn't supposed to tell you I was here.

30:05.555 --> 30:08.266
He didn't. Someone tweeted a picture of you
on the floor.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.185
The center of gravity
on champagne glasses is too high.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.103
That's what I've always said.

30:12.228 --> 30:14.439
And what happened
to the old-fashioned ones from the movies?

30:14.522 --> 30:17.025
They're too wide. They let the bubbles out.
I'm working right now.

30:17.108 --> 30:18.902
Yeah, Maggie said
you were working for a caterer.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.945
On the side. I still work at the store.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.697
It was good seeing you.

30:23.072 --> 30:26.159
I just have a minute.
We're waiting for some Senate information.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.911
I think Sherrod Brown is gonna keep his seat

30:27.994 --> 30:30.288
and it's looking like
McCaskill's gonna beat Todd Akin.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.748
- Do you know how frustrating this is?
- Careful.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.291
I want to kick your ass right now, but I can't

30:33.374 --> 30:34.667
'cause everyone else is. There's no room.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.461
So I have to feel bad for you instead.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.421
If those are the only choices,
I'd rather you kick my ass.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.173
- You don't get to decide. You know why?
- I do.

30:40.256 --> 30:41.716
Do you remember standing in front of me
and swearing...

30:41.799 --> 30:42.842
- Yes.
- Swearing that you

30:42.926 --> 30:44.177
- didn't have feelings...
- I meant it.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.888
You know that I found out from
that fucking YouTube video, you asshole?

30:46.971 --> 30:49.015
I don't think there's a way
it could have been worse.

30:49.098 --> 30:51.684
- Excuse me, Lisa. Is there a problem?
- No.

30:51.768 --> 30:54.062
It seems like there is because
you're speaking rudely to a guest.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.813
And the incident earlier,
that man was the President...

30:55.897 --> 30:57.065
There's no problem.

30:57.148 --> 30:59.359
And considering the circumstances,
she's being remarkably polite.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.694
On the other hand,
one of your servers is tweeting pictures

31:01.778 --> 31:04.155
from the party
and you signed a confidentiality agreement.

31:04.239 --> 31:05.615
Well, if that's true, it's serious.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.367
- It is.
- I'll take care of it.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.245
- Lisa, please be working.
- I'm coming now.

31:10.328 --> 31:11.621
How do you know it was one of the servers?

31:11.704 --> 31:13.039
- It probably wasn't.
- I have to go.

31:13.957 --> 31:16.501
I meant it. When I stood in front of you

31:16.584 --> 31:18.002
and when I swore, I meant it.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.254
- I believe you.
- Do you?

31:19.337 --> 31:22.298
Yes, it wasn't till after you got to know me
that you rejected me.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.384
- Champagne?
- No, thank you, I'm good.

31:24.467 --> 31:25.593
I didn't reject you.

31:25.677 --> 31:28.555
And there isn't a way
it could have been worse.

31:28.638 --> 31:30.890
Grey Goose up, three olives.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.893
Because at that point,
my worst fear was realized.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.437
- Spiders?
- You get a kick out of yourself, don't you?

31:36.521 --> 31:38.439
I actually ordered this on the rocks.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.316
My fault. I'll fix that.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.610
She got the number of olives right.
She's making progress.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.362
- What was that?
- I beg your pardon?

31:44.445 --> 31:45.822
Jim.

31:46.573 --> 31:49.033
- I don't know what your worst fear is.
- That you think I'm stupid.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.827
And stop trying to make up
for it by defending my honor

31:50.910 --> 31:52.412
to a guy you can obviously
beat the shit out of.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.163
- Stop.
- I can't.

31:54.497 --> 31:56.040
Do you think I think you're stupid?

31:56.124 --> 31:58.042
- I have to circulate.
- The whole time you thought...

31:58.126 --> 32:00.003
I'm smart enough to know
that I'm not smart enough.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.421
- For what?
- You.

32:01.504 --> 32:02.797
- Damn it. Stop walking.
- Can we drop it?

32:02.880 --> 32:04.090
Lisa.

32:05.174 --> 32:08.261
- I don't get you.
- Maggie is downstairs being a news producer.

32:08.344 --> 32:12.181
Your new girlfriend's in Boston covering
a presidential candidate for her own website.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.850
And I'm up here passing out drinks.
What evidence...

32:13.933 --> 32:17.520
You're working two jobs.
You're thoughtful and you're authentic.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.815
And I have never seen you
sneer at anyone or anything.

32:20.898 --> 32:24.277
There is, believe me,
no one that you're not good enough for

32:24.360 --> 32:26.279
and there is hardly anyone
who's good enough for you,

32:26.362 --> 32:28.114
including, it turned out, me.

32:28.197 --> 32:29.407
I'm about to turn 30.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.701
And you could just as easily
be someone's date here tonight

32:31.784 --> 32:33.369
or married to their black Am Ex.

32:33.453 --> 32:34.871
If they can make me laugh,
I'd take a green one.

32:36.706 --> 32:38.249
Did Maggie cut her own hair?

32:38.875 --> 32:40.543
- I don't speak to Maggie.
- You live in the same apartment.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.378
We have our own lives. Champagne?

32:42.462 --> 32:44.172
Strictly speaking,
champagne should be poured

32:44.255 --> 32:45.965
immediately after the bottle's been uncorked,

32:46.049 --> 32:47.884
but because you're very beautiful,
I'll make an exception.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.011
Yeah, yeah. Take the glass.

32:51.763 --> 32:53.222
- Maggie's in bad shape.
- I don't care.

32:53.306 --> 32:55.266
- I don't speak to Maggie.
- Please change that policy.

32:55.350 --> 32:56.643
- No.
- She's in bad shape.

32:56.726 --> 32:58.269
Because you're dating
that reporter from the bus?

32:58.353 --> 32:59.979
- It's hard for me to sympathize.
- Not because of me.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.732
- Because of Africa.
- What do you mean?

33:03.066 --> 33:05.276
- I don't care. Champagne?
- They don't want champagne.

33:05.360 --> 33:09.405
Are you saying Maggie
didn't tell you what happened in Uganda?

33:09.489 --> 33:12.575
No. And again, I don't care.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.703
Did she get hurt?
Did somebody... What are you saying?

33:15.787 --> 33:17.705
You have to ask her.

33:17.789 --> 33:19.957
I can't tell you
if she doesn't want you to know.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.585
But she wants you to know,
so you have to ask her.

33:24.212 --> 33:25.463
No.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.509
Did she cut her own hair off?

33:30.927 --> 33:33.179
There was hair on the bathroom floor.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.683
We're gonna make the Senate
call in Missouri and Ohio

33:36.766 --> 33:39.644
and we'll be throwing it
to DC in 10 or 11 minutes.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.562
<i>- Copy.</i>
- But if we're able to call Florida,

33:41.646 --> 33:44.315
or for that matter, the race, just send it back.

33:44.399 --> 33:47.026
<i>You're not gonna let DC call the race?</i>

33:47.652 --> 33:49.696
- Just send it back.
- (CLICKS BUTTON)

33:49.779 --> 33:52.281
<i>We'll try not to drop</i>
<i>sarin gas on anyone while we do.</i>

33:56.119 --> 33:57.161
(CLICKS BUTTON)

33:57.245 --> 33:59.831
If you've got something to say, Jane,
you should say it to me

33:59.914 --> 34:01.708
and not to the people in this control room

34:01.791 --> 34:03.876
who simply did what
I told them to do and did it well.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.421
<i>And I have people here who could live</i>
<i>without Genoa on their resumes,</i>

34:06.504 --> 34:09.966
<i>so I'm not sure from where you get the nerve</i>
<i>to insist that Will call the race.</i>

34:10.049 --> 34:11.509
I get the nerve from my mother.

34:11.592 --> 34:15.513
But for the record, it was a DC producer
who committed journalistic malpractice.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.765
And if I were you,
I'd be going through every story

34:17.849 --> 34:19.851
he ever produced for you frame by frame

34:19.934 --> 34:22.061
to find out what else
he's cooked along the way.

34:22.145 --> 34:24.522
<i>Good advice. Let me know if you</i>
<i>have any recommendations</i>

34:24.605 --> 34:27.942
<i>for your job</i>
<i>when I take Will's chair in New York.</i>

34:28.359 --> 34:30.069
It's Charlie Skinner, Jane.

34:30.153 --> 34:32.739
Send it back to New York
when Mac tells you to.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.658
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- The desk says go on Senate.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.786
We're ready to go on the Senate.
McCaskill and Brown.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.913
Because this is something
that needs to be kept in mind.

34:40.997 --> 34:44.250
- The entire world...
- Sorry, we're gonna make an important call.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.169
Two big races in the US Senate.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.172
ACN is projecting
that in Ohio, Sherrod Brown,

34:49.255 --> 34:51.424
the Democratic incumbent, will be reelected

34:51.507 --> 34:53.634
and Claire McCaskill,
the Democrat from Missouri,

34:53.718 --> 34:55.595
will keep her seat as well.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.430
<i>Elliot, what does that mean for the Senate?</i>

34:57.513 --> 34:59.599
ELLIOT: <i>It's now mathematically impossible</i>

34:59.682 --> 35:01.184
<i>for the Republicans</i>
<i>to take control of the Senate,</i>

35:01.309 --> 35:03.978
<i>even if Romney wins tonight</i>
<i>and Paul Ryan becomes the tiebreaker.</i>

35:04.061 --> 35:06.230
<i>So we're projecting now that Harry Reid</i>

35:06.314 --> 35:08.232
will stay in the Majority Leader's office.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.651
Taylor, should the Democrats
be sending the Tea Party

35:10.735 --> 35:13.946
a basket of mini muffins
and a thank you card for that?

35:14.030 --> 35:17.492
I think the Democrats
have a lot of gift baskets to hand out.

35:17.575 --> 35:19.577
Chris Christie, the media...

35:19.660 --> 35:21.621
Okay. Hold the phone.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.122
I can feel warmth about to happen.

35:23.206 --> 35:25.124
What media are you talking about
when you say media?

35:25.208 --> 35:27.168
- 'Cause there are a lot of us. ACN?
- Yes.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.128
Ah. Well, please continue.

35:29.212 --> 35:30.797
I worked in the Romney press shop

35:30.880 --> 35:33.591
<i>and I can tell you</i>
<i>that on average over the last six months,</i>

35:33.674 --> 35:36.469
News Night <i>did 14 negative stories</i>

35:36.552 --> 35:37.678
<i>about Republicans to every one...</i>

35:37.762 --> 35:39.013
Hey, Molly. It's New York.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.807
<i>- Copy.</i>
- Coming to you shortly. Stand by.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.642
<i>If Republicans do 14 crazy things in a month,</i>

35:42.725 --> 35:44.310
does that mean the unbiased thing to do

35:44.393 --> 35:47.647
would be for us to concoct 13
additional crazy Democrat stories?

35:47.730 --> 35:49.649
- Are we doing this now?
- WILL: <i>We're doing this.</i>

35:49.732 --> 35:52.026
- Go to Molly in St. Louis.
- Then let me give you another statistic.

35:52.109 --> 35:55.822
- Almost nobody... Okay.
- No, we're going to St. Louis first.

35:55.905 --> 35:59.283
<i>Molly Sadler is with the McCaskill campaign</i>
<i>at the Omni Convention Center.</i>

35:59.367 --> 36:01.661
<i>Molly, do I have to ask</i>
<i>what the mood is there?</i>

36:01.744 --> 36:04.288
<i>I would say the mood is jubilation, Will.</i>

36:18.135 --> 36:20.680
Is there a chance
I can get you to ask Hallie a favor for me?

36:20.763 --> 36:23.641
- What's the favor?
- I need her to post a story tonight.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.352
Which I've already written about the effect
the debates had on the outcome.

36:26.435 --> 36:30.523
In this story she quotes Mac, who's identified
both as the EP of <i>News Night</i>

36:30.606 --> 36:32.692
and a former president
of the Cambridge Union.

36:32.775 --> 36:35.945
That's the only way
to get Wikipedia to change the entry?

36:36.028 --> 36:37.029
Yeah.

36:37.113 --> 36:39.740
Are you proud of your army
of citizen journalists?

36:39.824 --> 36:41.617
Have you called any more
elections on your own?

36:41.701 --> 36:42.952
- No.
- Just the one?

36:43.035 --> 36:45.329
I'll ask her. But, you know, she's a little busy.

36:45.413 --> 36:46.747
And ethical.

36:46.831 --> 36:49.917
I'd like to do this for Mac tonight as a gift.

36:51.794 --> 36:54.255
I'll do it when I have a minute.

36:54.505 --> 36:56.257
The left doesn't have
a version of the Tea Party.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.842
What's OWS?

36:57.925 --> 37:00.177
There wasn't an OWS candidate
on the ballot tonight.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.680
The left's crazy people
hardly ever run for office.

37:02.763 --> 37:04.265
And when they do, they don't win.

37:04.348 --> 37:05.766
<i>Who's Allen West to the left?</i>

37:05.850 --> 37:08.060
<i>Who's Joe Walsh or Michele Bachmann?</i>

37:08.144 --> 37:10.897
<i>A 14-to-1 ratio of negative stories</i>
<i>and your takeaway is</i>

37:10.980 --> 37:12.231
<i>that there's a problem with the storyteller.</i>

37:12.315 --> 37:14.358
<i>What are your thoughts</i>
<i>about that, Taylor Warren?</i>

37:14.442 --> 37:17.236
<i>- Cannot remember the question.</i>
- Any word from Reese?

37:17.320 --> 37:19.614
- He's still walking.
- He's what?

37:19.697 --> 37:21.157
He's walking.

37:21.240 --> 37:24.118
He's walking around
the neighborhood with a Rockette.

37:24.201 --> 37:27.163
Presumably trying to decide
how to announce the personnel changes

37:27.246 --> 37:30.249
and how much money
to pay Dantana to not file in the morning.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.378
- What's a Rockette?
- The dancers.

37:34.462 --> 37:37.089
He's dating a Rockette. A real one.

37:40.676 --> 37:44.013
DON: Is there anything
that'll convince you it wasn't your fault?

37:49.018 --> 37:50.603
Get together with Sloan and talk about

37:50.686 --> 37:53.773
a 90-second segment
on income and voting preferences.

37:53.856 --> 37:56.484
- Okay, Jane, we're coming to you.
- If I can jump in...

37:56.567 --> 37:59.111
MACKENZIE: <i>Let's go to DC</i>
<i>for a whip-around on the Senate.</i>

37:59.195 --> 38:01.781
I have to cut you off there
and throw to Jane Barrow

38:01.864 --> 38:03.366
and our panel in Washington.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.409
<i>Jane, the Republicans will control the House</i>

38:05.493 --> 38:07.119
<i>and the Democrats will control the Senate.</i>

38:07.203 --> 38:09.455
<i>A billion dollars later,</i>
<i>are we right back where we were?</i>

38:09.538 --> 38:10.915
<i>That's the question</i>
<i>I want to put to our panel...</i>

38:10.998 --> 38:13.125
DON: We're out. DC has the con.

38:13.209 --> 38:14.669
HERB: 5:30 back.

38:14.877 --> 38:16.128
No.

38:16.712 --> 38:17.797
No what?

38:19.882 --> 38:22.385
There's nothing that'll convince me.

38:23.511 --> 38:25.805
JANE: <i>There is at least some good news</i>
<i>coming out of Utah</i>

38:25.888 --> 38:27.807
<i>where it looks like Senator Orrin Hatch...</i>

38:27.890 --> 38:29.892
HALLIE: <i>I just got an e-mail</i>
<i>with an attachment.</i>

38:29.976 --> 38:31.310
- From me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

38:31.394 --> 38:34.438
<i>The attachment was an article about the effect</i>
<i>of the debates on the election.</i>

38:34.522 --> 38:35.856
- Yeah.
<i>- You know who wrote it?</i>

38:35.940 --> 38:37.400
- Neal.
<i>- Nope.</i>

38:37.483 --> 38:39.193
<i>- I can explain.</i>
- The byline says I did.

38:39.276 --> 38:42.697
<i>- He knew you were busy. Here's the thing...</i>
- What the hell is going on?

38:42.780 --> 38:46.325
We need someone
who doesn't work here to post an article

38:46.409 --> 38:48.703
that contains the information that MacKenzie

38:48.786 --> 38:51.455
was president of the Cambridge Union
and not the Oxford Union

38:51.539 --> 38:53.749
<i>so that Wikipedia would edit her page.</i>

38:53.833 --> 38:57.878
<i>- You know, now that I'm saying it...</i>
- Not until just now?

38:57.962 --> 38:59.922
- What's the mood there?
<i>- What's the mood there?</i>

39:00.047 --> 39:03.801
- I know. I know.
- Okay, well, I have to go.

39:03.884 --> 39:05.970
It's starting to sink in
that they're gonna lose Florida.

39:06.053 --> 39:08.347
And between you and me,
he didn't write a concession speech.

39:08.431 --> 39:10.641
- Can I ask you something?
<i>- I really do have to go.</i>

39:10.850 --> 39:12.685
So do I, but...

39:13.978 --> 39:15.604
Do I ever make you feel like you're dumb?

39:16.564 --> 39:18.733
Seriously, honey, what's going on there?

39:18.941 --> 39:22.069
I'm asking because I really like you
and I don't want to blow it.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.740
Well, first of all, you're not smart enough
to make me feel like I'm dumb.

39:25.823 --> 39:27.366
<i>I was hoping you'd say that.</i>

39:27.450 --> 39:29.660
And I really like you, too.
You're not blowing it.

39:30.536 --> 39:34.373
I knew there had to be a reason
why I liked you so much.

39:34.457 --> 39:36.876
'Cause just physically, you're hard to look at.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.128
- You're not so much homely as you are...
<i>- Talk to you soon.</i>

39:39.211 --> 39:40.421
...just weird-looking.

39:40.504 --> 39:41.839
- Jim.
- Yeah?

39:41.922 --> 39:43.716
Maggie says to tell you
they're 93 votes apart now

39:43.799 --> 39:45.092
and you'd know what that means.

39:45.176 --> 39:46.510
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.724
The gender income gap starts at 50K.

39:51.807 --> 39:54.351
Men 50K and above are breaking for Romney.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.063
Women at 50-200K
were more likely to vote for the President.

39:57.146 --> 40:00.399
And it's the top 1%
of female earners that went red.

40:00.483 --> 40:02.985
Now here's where I'd like us to focus,
because this is crucial.

40:03.069 --> 40:04.904
- I'm sorry, but they need you.
- Wow!

40:05.112 --> 40:07.823
- They're calling Ohio.
- We're on our way.

40:08.616 --> 40:11.494
You're back in 90 seconds.
We'll pick this up after, okay?

40:29.845 --> 40:32.264
Both. We're calling both,
and we're ready to go to Chicago.

40:32.348 --> 40:34.058
- Tess.
- I'll get estimates from Boston.

40:34.141 --> 40:35.935
- Thank you.
- And let's get Ben standing by.

40:36.018 --> 40:38.479
MACKENZIE: I don't see Sloan.
Is that Sloan out there?

40:38.562 --> 40:39.688
We'll go without her.

40:41.107 --> 40:43.692
MACKENZIE: We're calling it.
Get in the studio.

40:43.776 --> 40:46.779
JANE:...<i>and that takes the President to 262.</i>

40:46.862 --> 40:50.241
<i>At that point, he has a lot of</i>
<i>different roads to 270.</i>

40:50.324 --> 40:53.410
<i>Colorado, Florida, Ohio and Virginia,</i>
<i>in that scenario,</i>

40:53.494 --> 40:56.622
<i>any one of those states</i>
<i>would throw the President over the top.</i>

40:56.705 --> 41:00.709
<i>Getting Mitt Romney to 270 at this point</i>
<i>seems very, very difficult.</i>

41:01.710 --> 41:05.756
<i>So the President's getting closer and closer</i>
<i>to that magic number of 270.</i>

41:05.840 --> 41:07.299
<i>He's winning in the states he needs to win...</i>

41:07.383 --> 41:09.885
- What I have can't be taught.
- Get her in the chair!

41:10.094 --> 41:13.806
<i>I mean, it really started in the last hour</i>
<i>when Florida started to slip away.</i>

41:13.931 --> 41:16.934
<i>We're hearing from</i>
<i>very unhappy Republicans.</i>

41:17.017 --> 41:19.687
SLOAN: <i>But right now we're going</i>
<i>to Will McAvoy in New York</i>

41:19.770 --> 41:22.314
<i>who's got a new projection. Will.</i>

41:25.192 --> 41:28.821
<i>It's 1 1:14 in the East</i>
<i>and ACN is able to project</i>

41:28.904 --> 41:31.407
<i>that Barack Obama</i>
<i>will be living in government housing</i>

41:31.490 --> 41:32.950
<i>for the next four years.</i>

41:33.033 --> 41:36.662
<i>President Obama has been reelected</i>
<i>President of the United States,</i>

41:36.745 --> 41:38.914
<i>Ohio having just put him over the top.</i>

41:39.248 --> 41:41.250
Once again, the ACN decision desk

41:41.333 --> 41:45.087
is calling Ohio and the White House
for President Barack Obama.

41:45.421 --> 41:48.674
<i>We're gonna go live to Suzannah Marquez</i>
<i>and show you some images from Chicago</i>

41:48.757 --> 41:50.342
<i>where the celebration is under way.</i>

41:50.426 --> 41:52.344
SUZANNAH: <i>Will, as you can see, the news</i>

41:52.428 --> 41:55.389
<i>has gone through this crowd</i>
<i>and the celebration has begun.</i>

41:55.639 --> 41:57.850
<i>How about "binders full of women"?</i>

41:57.933 --> 42:00.686
<i>Was the media response</i>
<i>to "binders full of women"</i>

42:00.769 --> 42:01.937
<i>in rational proportion?</i>

42:02.021 --> 42:03.355
WILL: <i>That's a perfectly good question.</i>

42:03.439 --> 42:05.191
TAYLOR: <i>Thanks, I was asking it to you.</i>

42:05.274 --> 42:07.693
And now he's losing.

42:12.948 --> 42:14.533
(SIGHS)

42:17.036 --> 42:18.996
Why'd you cut your hair?

42:19.622 --> 42:21.290
I wanted a change.

42:21.498 --> 42:22.917
I'm not crazy about it either.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.543
The stylist kind of talked me into it. (LAUGHS)

42:24.627 --> 42:26.837
- Maybe I'll get used to it.
- There wasn't a stylist.

42:28.214 --> 42:29.965
You cut it yourself.

42:30.049 --> 42:32.134
You cut off your hair
and dyed it a different color.

42:33.802 --> 42:35.262
Lisa told me.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.056
How would Lisa know?

42:37.139 --> 42:39.391
How did you not tell her
what happened in Africa?

42:39.475 --> 42:40.684
- Did you?
- No.

42:40.768 --> 42:42.603
- Don't.
- How did you not tell your best friend?

42:42.686 --> 42:45.189
- It's been a year.
- And it's been a year since we were friends.

42:45.272 --> 42:48.901
He's losing by 17 votes
with 8,000 votes uncounted.

42:48.984 --> 42:50.986
Why did you cut your hair?

42:52.947 --> 42:55.157
He'd never seen blonde hair before.

42:55.241 --> 42:57.910
While I was reading to him,
he was playing with my hair.

42:57.993 --> 42:59.411
So I cut my hair.

43:00.663 --> 43:02.331
- How'd it work?
- It didn't.

43:02.498 --> 43:03.832
Right.

43:05.626 --> 43:08.754
I'm trying to find out
where the uncounted votes are, but even if...

43:08.837 --> 43:10.714
Listen. Listen for a second.

43:11.465 --> 43:13.092
You went back into the building.

43:14.051 --> 43:15.970
You went back in there.

43:16.178 --> 43:17.680
You and Gary.

43:18.264 --> 43:19.556
You pulled him out from under the bed.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.433
- You weren't going without him.
- He was safer under the bed.

43:21.517 --> 43:23.143
Bullshit, Maggie.

43:24.103 --> 43:27.147
You pulled him out
and you carried him on your back to the bus.

43:27.606 --> 43:28.899
What was your crime?

43:29.692 --> 43:32.903
You turned around when
you heard Gary fall down.

43:35.739 --> 43:39.535
There's a difference
between being tough and wanting to be.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.705
You and Mac are tough.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.207
Don's tough. I want to be.

43:47.126 --> 43:48.377
You are.

43:57.970 --> 43:59.972
You know when I first noticed you?

44:00.055 --> 44:02.933
When I ran into the room
and got tackled by Mac's luggage?

44:03.017 --> 44:04.560
Did you know...

44:05.477 --> 44:08.981
No. It was funny,
but I didn't notice you until later.

44:11.108 --> 44:13.819
There was a beep. It was an iNews alert.

44:13.902 --> 44:15.404
- (BEEPING)
<i>- But it was yellow.</i>

44:15.487 --> 44:16.697
You've got a news alert.

44:18.907 --> 44:22.202
- Nobody was paying attention to it.
- It was yellow.

44:22.411 --> 44:23.912
You clicked on it anyway.

44:33.672 --> 44:35.632
You couldn't help yourself.

44:41.764 --> 44:44.099
You ran back into the building.

44:47.644 --> 44:49.605
He's dead and I'm alive.

44:53.150 --> 44:55.361
That's what I'd keep in mind.

45:03.786 --> 45:06.997
It's after midnight now,
and I feel like I can ask a question.

45:07.081 --> 45:09.041
- Sure.
- I meant to Will.

45:09.124 --> 45:10.292
Yes.

45:11.251 --> 45:13.212
Who did you vote for today?

45:13.295 --> 45:14.880
You know I'm not answering that.

45:14.963 --> 45:18.467
Oh, I thought you might because you revealed
your party affiliation on the air last year.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.135
I did. I identified myself

45:20.219 --> 45:22.513
as a Republican because I thought it was fair

45:22.596 --> 45:24.431
<i>to give to the viewer</i>
<i>given the commentary I was delivering.</i>

45:24.515 --> 45:28.394
TAYLOR: <i>A commentary that ended with you</i>
<i>calling the Tea Party the American Taliban.</i>

45:28.477 --> 45:30.604
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- And in the body of the commentary</i>

45:30.687 --> 45:34.066
- was a blistering indictment of Republicans.
- Exactly the opposite.

45:34.149 --> 45:36.318
It was a blistering
indictment of people who aren't Republicans.

45:36.402 --> 45:39.905
- Well, who's to say who is and who isn't?
- On that night, I did.

45:40.197 --> 45:42.991
I want to remind you
you asked me to pursue this area.

45:43.075 --> 45:46.120
- I understand.
- And I'm wondering, with all respect,

45:46.203 --> 45:48.539
do you call yourself a Republican

45:48.622 --> 45:52.501
<i>so you can make a claim to credibility</i>
<i>when you attack the GOP?</i>

45:53.085 --> 45:55.671
<i>No, I call myself a Republican 'cause I am one.</i>

45:56.255 --> 45:59.466
I believe in market solutions
and I believe in common sense realities

45:59.550 --> 46:03.762
and the necessity to defend ourselves
against a dangerous world and that's about it.

46:03.846 --> 46:06.557
Problem is now I have to be homophobic.

46:06.723 --> 46:09.977
I have to count
the number of times people go to church.

46:10.060 --> 46:13.981
I have to deny facts
and think scientific research is a long con.

46:14.064 --> 46:16.692
I have to think poor people
are getting a sweet ride.

46:16.775 --> 46:20.112
And I have to
have such a stunning inferiority complex

46:20.195 --> 46:24.324
that I fear education
and intellect in the 21st century.

46:24.408 --> 46:25.784
But most of all, the biggest new requirement,

46:25.868 --> 46:29.705
really the only requirement,
is that I have to hate Democrats.

46:30.330 --> 46:32.791
<i>And I have to hate Chris Christie</i>
<i>for not spitting on the President</i>

46:32.875 --> 46:34.376
<i>when he got off Air Force One.</i>

46:34.460 --> 46:37.671
<i>The two-party system</i>
<i>is crucial to the whole operation.</i>

46:37.754 --> 46:40.215
<i>There's honor in being the loyal opposition.</i>

46:40.549 --> 46:43.051
And I'm a Republican
for the same reasons you are.

46:43.719 --> 46:46.638
So I hope your voice gets
louder in the next four years.

46:46.805 --> 46:49.683
Well, I don't like losing, so count on it.

46:49.766 --> 46:51.768
You know, just jumping on top of that idea...

46:51.852 --> 46:53.729
- I'm sorry, Sloan.
- Come on!

46:53.812 --> 46:55.105
We're gonna go to Jane Barrow in Washington

46:55.230 --> 46:57.649
for an update on some
West Coast House races.

46:57.733 --> 47:00.152
Plenty more coverage coming tonight. Jane?

47:00.235 --> 47:02.237
- JAKE: And clear.
- Are you doing it on purpose now?

47:02.321 --> 47:04.740
No, it's just working out unbelievably well.

47:05.908 --> 47:07.242
(SIGHS)

47:09.995 --> 47:12.956
You ever read Jedediah Purdy,
<i>For Common Things?</i>

47:13.332 --> 47:14.541
No.

47:15.501 --> 47:18.337
He talks about cynical times.

47:18.962 --> 47:21.548
People having terminal irony

47:21.632 --> 47:25.427
with a studied refusal to hope or care openly.

47:26.428 --> 47:28.138
- Does that sound like us?
- No.

47:28.222 --> 47:29.348
No.

47:30.307 --> 47:34.520
Have you asked yourself tonight
why we never reported the Petraeus story?

47:34.603 --> 47:36.355
- The Petraeus?
- Remember?

47:36.438 --> 47:38.482
David Petraeus is resigning on Thursday.

47:38.565 --> 47:41.151
- We didn't report it.
- That's funny. I forgot.

47:41.235 --> 47:45.197
Yeah. It's because we never made the trade.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.741
The decision was
that the other story had information

47:47.824 --> 47:50.285
voters needed, the Petraeus story didn't.

47:50.369 --> 47:54.831
Not that many voters. It would have
affected maybe a few thousand, tops.

47:54.915 --> 47:57.417
In one district, one seat.

47:57.501 --> 48:00.087
As opposed to breaking two days early

48:00.170 --> 48:02.256
what will be a giant story.

48:02.339 --> 48:05.384
Breaking it in front
of an Election Night audience.

48:05.467 --> 48:09.137
And the decision to decline
the trade was made instantly

48:09.930 --> 48:11.640
and unanimously.

48:13.559 --> 48:17.521
Don pushed back reflexively,
but he came around in seven seconds.

48:17.604 --> 48:18.981
Don.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.362
We've come a long way.

48:29.032 --> 48:30.784
I'm not resigning.

48:31.660 --> 48:32.953
And neither are you.

48:33.996 --> 48:36.832
What, are we out of our fucking minds?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.836
Dantana doctored the tape.
That's what happened, Will.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.839
We know the truth and the mob doesn't.

48:43.922 --> 48:47.301
When did we decide it was
an institutional failure?

48:47.384 --> 48:50.345
We waited 11 months.

48:50.429 --> 48:52.472
We know people who would have gone

48:52.556 --> 48:55.934
after the second
red team meeting or even the first.

48:56.018 --> 48:57.769
You agree with what I'm saying?

48:57.853 --> 49:00.439
I believe, except for the things
we did wrong, we did everything right.

49:00.522 --> 49:03.609
And I can't live with Mac
taking the blame for...

49:04.359 --> 49:06.445
We'll get the audience's trust back.

49:06.528 --> 49:08.030
Like Leona said,

49:08.113 --> 49:11.325
we're gonna overcome the terminal irony.

49:11.408 --> 49:15.120
And the laundry list
of embarrassing things in the complaint?

49:15.203 --> 49:17.456
I've got to tell you, I'm not embarrassed.

49:17.539 --> 49:20.208
The Zimmerman tape,
Jim going to New Hampshire,

49:20.292 --> 49:22.461
Sloan punching a guy in arbitrage...

49:22.544 --> 49:23.920
I actually like that one.

49:27.841 --> 49:29.343
I can't tell what you're thinking.

49:32.512 --> 49:33.889
Will?

49:35.724 --> 49:37.267
It's gotten strange now.

49:37.351 --> 49:39.728
Are you able to hear me speaking?

49:43.315 --> 49:46.860
She, except for the things she did wrong,
she did everything right, too.

49:46.943 --> 49:48.695
- The rest was me.
- I'm lost.

49:48.779 --> 49:50.614
Uh, yes.

49:51.615 --> 49:54.785
We're going to do the things you just said

49:54.868 --> 49:56.828
for the reasons you just gave.

49:56.912 --> 50:00.290
I missed parts of what
you were saying at the end,

50:00.374 --> 50:03.752
but that's just gonna have to be...

50:03.835 --> 50:05.754
I'll be right back. Yes!

50:06.338 --> 50:07.673
Way to go.

50:09.758 --> 50:12.052
Yeah, no, I'm definitely resigning.

50:30.570 --> 50:32.239
Does anyone know where MacKenzie is?

50:32.322 --> 50:34.116
- I think she's in the hair and makeup room.
- She's not.

50:34.199 --> 50:36.576
- Did you look in her office?
- So, no, no one knows where she is?

50:36.660 --> 50:39.955
HERB: We're back in seven minutes,
so she's gonna turn up.

50:42.457 --> 50:43.834
- Have you seen Mac?
- I haven't.

50:43.917 --> 50:45.419
But I have facts about the Great Lakes region.

50:45.502 --> 50:48.130
Right this moment is the least I've ever
cared about the Great Lakes region.

50:48.213 --> 50:50.590
Has anyone seen Mac?

50:51.299 --> 50:53.009
I'm right here.

50:54.344 --> 50:56.096
Okay. I didn't...

51:04.146 --> 51:06.356
Could you come here away from the cameras?

51:06.481 --> 51:07.607
Yeah.

51:09.151 --> 51:11.403
There's... Okay, okay...

51:11.486 --> 51:12.904
- There's a story.
- What?

51:12.988 --> 51:15.115
There's a story about
a little kid who keeps shredding paper

51:15.198 --> 51:18.368
and his parents take him to all kinds of
doctors to get him to stop shredding paper.

51:18.452 --> 51:20.704
And finally they take him
to the most expensive doctor in the world

51:20.787 --> 51:23.415
who turns to the kid and he says,
"Kid, if you stop shredding paper,

51:23.498 --> 51:25.250
"your parents will stop
dragging you to doctors."

51:25.333 --> 51:29.087
And the kid turns to his parents
and says, "Why didn't you just say so?"

51:32.174 --> 51:34.176
- Well, all right, then.
- The point of the story

51:34.259 --> 51:37.596
is that the kid
could make himself happy by just stopping.

51:37.679 --> 51:42.100
I think that's the point. I don't know.
I've been trying to figure it out.

51:42.601 --> 51:44.478
But, uh, I didn't return it.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.898
Because I'm in love with you.

51:47.981 --> 51:49.608
- What did you say?
- And because of... Will you marry me?

51:49.691 --> 51:51.109
- Wait.
- I said will you marry me?

51:51.193 --> 51:53.028
And before that, I said I'm in love with you.

51:53.236 --> 51:55.113
That's, that's... That's what I'm getting at.

51:55.197 --> 51:57.157
I feel like I can do this so much better
if I can have a second.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.700
What in the fuck is happening right now?

51:58.784 --> 52:02.704
If... If I... I don't ever want to not be... No.

52:02.788 --> 52:05.373
I love you. I'm gonna go back to that.
And will you marry me?

52:05.457 --> 52:08.293
And let me just say I really think you should.
I think you should say yes.

52:08.543 --> 52:10.253
But no matter what you say,

52:10.337 --> 52:13.298
there's no chance
I am ever gonna hurt you again.

52:13.632 --> 52:16.802
And no matter what you say, I'm gonna be
in love with you for the rest of my life.

52:16.885 --> 52:19.638
There's no way out of that.
That's just a physical law of the universe.

52:19.721 --> 52:21.723
- You own me. No matter what you say...
- Yes.

52:21.807 --> 52:24.810
- ...I will never stop...
- Yes. I'm saying yes.

52:29.105 --> 52:30.148
You're saying yes?

52:32.275 --> 52:33.902
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

52:37.948 --> 52:39.074
Thank God.

52:53.630 --> 52:55.340
Took you long enough.

52:55.423 --> 52:57.300
Seriously? That's what your...

52:57.384 --> 52:58.593
Shut it.

53:10.355 --> 53:11.690
REBECCA: So your mother was a Rockette?

53:11.773 --> 53:13.525
That's right. And her mother, too.

53:13.608 --> 53:15.402
- Third generation Rockette?
- Yes.

53:15.485 --> 53:16.903
How great is that?

53:16.987 --> 53:19.197
- And if you were to have a daughter...
- Crazy lady.

53:19.281 --> 53:20.699
...which would be my granddaughter,

53:20.782 --> 53:23.243
would it be important to you
that she also be a Rockette?

53:23.326 --> 53:24.828
- I don't think important, but if she...
- Okay, good.

53:24.911 --> 53:27.122
- REESE: Charlie.
- 'Cause over here you have a Harvard MBA.

53:27.205 --> 53:30.709
Over here you have a line
of synchronized nutcrackers.

53:30.834 --> 53:32.544
- Charlie.
- Reese.

53:32.961 --> 53:35.255
Leona. Rebecca.

53:35.797 --> 53:38.466
- I'm sorry, I don't know who...
- Jackie. I'm here with Reese.

53:38.550 --> 53:41.303
Third generation Rockette. That's how we roll.

53:41.386 --> 53:45.223
I've studied the findings of the report
and I've consulted with counsel

53:45.307 --> 53:47.350
and I've reached the conclusion
that the news division

53:47.434 --> 53:50.353
handled Genoa as well as I'd want it handled.

53:51.021 --> 53:53.064
Furthermore, this company
will give Dantana money

53:53.148 --> 53:55.358
when a federal judge orders us to do so.

53:55.442 --> 53:58.612
And furthermore after that,
I don't take my instructions

53:58.695 --> 54:00.280
from a petition.

54:00.363 --> 54:03.033
If you read Jedediah Purdy's excellent
book <i>For Common Things...</i>

54:03.116 --> 54:05.535
- What, did you e-mail everybody excerpts?
- Yep.

54:05.619 --> 54:08.079
I'm not accepting your resignations.

54:08.163 --> 54:09.956
We're not resigning.

54:10.624 --> 54:13.418
That's fine,
but I'm surprising you by taking the high road

54:13.501 --> 54:15.712
- and I'm not accepting your resignations.
- We're not offering them.

54:15.795 --> 54:17.255
This isn't about the bottom line.

54:17.339 --> 54:19.090
This is a bad business decision,
but it's a good decision.

54:19.174 --> 54:20.926
- I'm doing the right thing.
- There's no right thing to do.

54:21.009 --> 54:22.761
I've already made the decision
that we're staying.

54:22.844 --> 54:25.180
The wrong thing to do
would be to accept your resignation.

54:25.263 --> 54:27.432
That's not an option,
'cause we're not offering them.

54:27.515 --> 54:30.769
- You two about done?
- History should reflect that I acted admirably.

54:30.852 --> 54:32.479
There's really no way of knowing that.

54:32.562 --> 54:34.814
Is it possible the greater glory belongs to me?

54:34.898 --> 54:37.567
You're all idiots. Not you, you're sweet.

54:38.109 --> 54:41.279
Everyone, uh, just listen up for just a second.

54:41.363 --> 54:42.447
This'll just take a second.

54:42.530 --> 54:44.407
First of all, no one's resigning.

54:44.491 --> 54:46.576
And the only reason you need is
'cause I said so.

54:46.660 --> 54:48.787
Also I think we're
just starting to get the hang of this.

54:48.870 --> 54:51.247
More importantly, I would like to introduce

54:51.331 --> 54:56.002
the future Mrs. MacKenzie
Morgan McHale McAvoy...

54:56.086 --> 54:57.545
That's not gonna work.

55:01.049 --> 55:02.217
- What?
- (ALL CHEERING)

55:03.301 --> 55:05.136
- I'll be damned!
- WILL: I know.

55:05.637 --> 55:08.098
I know. I know.

55:11.476 --> 55:12.936
(INAUDIBLE)

55:16.898 --> 55:17.857
(POPS)

55:17.941 --> 55:20.652
<i>(LET MY LOVE OPEN</i>
<i>THE DOOR</i> PLAYING)

55:35.166 --> 55:37.669
- Wake him up.
- Cynthia's office should draft a statement.

55:37.752 --> 55:39.754
Let's start identifying who our friends are.

55:39.838 --> 55:41.256
That shouldn't take long.

55:58.231 --> 55:59.691
(COUGHING)

56:10.994 --> 56:12.454
JIM: What did you do?

56:12.537 --> 56:14.039
<i>I wrote it myself.</i>

56:14.122 --> 56:15.957
<i>A gift from new media.</i>

56:16.541 --> 56:18.043
<i>Thanks for that Romney interview.</i>

56:19.627 --> 56:22.005
