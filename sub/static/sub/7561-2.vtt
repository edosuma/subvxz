00:58.360 --> 01:00.959
18-14, do you hear us?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.319
18-14 here.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.239
Understood. Thanks.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.879
19-P, are you at the location?

01:09.760 --> 01:12.119
- Suspect sighted.
- All clear.

01:13.680 --> 01:14.959
Get ready.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.719
Rue de Ménagère 18, second floor.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.279
I'm picking up a signal.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.519
Inform the units on site.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.279
Understood.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.519
All teams go.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.439
Police!

03:19.120 --> 03:20.599
Police!

03:25.320 --> 03:26.799
You're clear to go in.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.279
- There are kids over there.
- OK.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.599
Shit.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.759
- You can't go. He's had a heart attack.
- He's my brother.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.679
There's nothing.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.239
- Nothing?
- No.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.719
We have 2 more warrants. Let's go.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.559
Police.

05:16.120 --> 05:16.999
Police.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.599
It's going to shit. Hurry up.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.559
- Is it clear?
- Clear.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.959
Nobody here.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.599
Oh fuck!

05:50.880 --> 05:52.159
Come on, move it!

07:51.960 --> 07:52.119
Police! Police! Police!

07:52.120 --> 07:54.879
Police! Police! Police!

08:14.760 --> 08:16.079
Police!

08:40.360 --> 08:42.559
They're here!
They're here. Come on.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.519
That's not one of the flats.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.039
They're moving the guns.
Let's go.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.399
Do I call the intervention team back?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.199
There's no time.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.279
Are you alone here?

09:35.720 --> 09:36.919
Oh fuck.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.919
Guys!

09:41.400 --> 09:42.439
Guys!

09:47.520 --> 09:49.239
Retirement's working for you?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.319
Back to the vehicles. Let's go.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.719
You can put the mask on.
It might help you breathing.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.999
Does it only hurt there?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.999
His pacemaker failed,
but he's stable now.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.359
However, Mr. Celik...

11:42.480 --> 11:45.519
- Yes, I know. I'll get the money.
- What money, Milan?

11:51.080 --> 11:52.799
You're okay, buddy?

11:55.560 --> 11:57.399
Why are you freaking out?

11:58.240 --> 12:00.799
- Sorry, I need to breath.
- Go on.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.719
Are they going to open me up again?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.319
They need to fix your heart.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.519
- Why? Is it broken?
- Don't joke around, Adnan.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.079
It's because Nada Topcagic blew me off.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.359
How could it not be broken?

12:22.480 --> 12:25.679
Do you know Nada Topcagic?
She sings Blond hair, it's morning...

12:25.800 --> 12:30.879
- I don't know that shitty music.
- You don't know anything, anyway.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.999
Of course you know it.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.519
It's morning
It's morning...

12:37.640 --> 12:39.639
Shut up, they're going to hear us.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.559
I shouldn't have woken up
since you're not here

12:42.680 --> 12:46.679
There are no spots on the pillow
that I did not kiss

12:46.800 --> 12:50.599
- You are my desire...
- Just die already.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.799
You are my desire

12:55.880 --> 12:59.679
By Allah,
are you as hungry as I am, Milan?

13:00.800 --> 13:02.959
Forget Allah.
We are Serbs, now.

13:03.080 --> 13:03.879
What Allah?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.199
Hunger will kill me
before the mean Serb catches up to me.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.839
Adnan, you're not
the only hungry one. So what?

13:10.960 --> 13:13.039
Should we flip a coin?

13:13.160 --> 13:17.719
The one who wins
can kill the other and eat him.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.319
What coin, buddy?
You're losing it.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.479
Are you cold?
Come here.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.599
Things have changed.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.319
Yes, my friend.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.879
Hi.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.479
- You know I've always admired you.
- I know.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.679
You know what, I'll be honest with you,
that's who I am.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.119
When you came back
- you probably know that -

14:16.240 --> 14:21.879
I told Zlatko to tell Dragan to fuck off
and to put a bullet in your head.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.559
- I believe he didn't listen to you.
- No, he didn't.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.519
Maybe you're not
as powerful as you want.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.719
Wait here. He's coming.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.559
Do you want me to call you...
Milan or the Animal?

14:53.680 --> 14:54.559
Milan.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.199
- You'll call me Milan.
- Little Milan.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.519
Milan.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.639
My name's Zlatko, little Milan.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.479
Are you ready for all this,
little Milan?

15:09.320 --> 15:10.479
For what?

15:12.640 --> 15:14.119
Yeah, what...

15:16.280 --> 15:18.999
He's looking for young blood,
little Milan.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.479
Young blood to do what?

15:23.240 --> 15:24.799
I want the money.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.239
Money, huh?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.479
Maybe you'll get some.
Maybe.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.519
What's up?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.519
Come on, show him.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.399
Look at that.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.719
That means you belong to me.
Do you have a problem with that?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.879
No. I can belong to you.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.959
Come on, get in.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.479
Ah, you little...

16:26.880 --> 16:29.039
What a place, right buddy?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.119
Disgusting, obviously.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.039
Obviously.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.999
Well, kids love this place,
what can you do?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.279
I let them play here a little.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.399
It's part of my contribution
to the social community.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.799
So they have a good memory
of the Panthers.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.399
Like when politicians
say bullshit like that.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.399
- Zlatko.
- Tell me.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.759
I need money for my brother.
My diamond money.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.719
You see, the Animal, you were never able
to express yourself nicely.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.999
Come,
I have something to show you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.119
Birds.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.999
- What birds?
- What are you laughing at?

17:20.880 --> 17:23.319
Kosovo birds.
That's important.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.279
Sit down.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.519
Dragan never understood
he had to be modern.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.239
Diamond money,
even gun money, it's nothing.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.599
And there's too much risk.

17:48.440 --> 17:52.239
Way too much. If only the risk
of killing a child by mistake.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.079
We live in modern times.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.759
Things need to be changed.
I change them.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.799
No more drugs, no more guns,
no more diamonds.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.519
Only clean stuff, mate.

18:07.160 --> 18:11.999
What you brought me,
that's not what we are anymore.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.799
Or maybe you're not like us anymore.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.919
I'll give you the money
for your brother.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.999
But you need to understand that a lot
has changed since you left. A lot.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.919
Be patient.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.799
And trust us.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.399
What are you talking about?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.599
Zlatko, you're talking
about trust and all,

18:40.720 --> 18:44.559
while wearing the watch that I stole.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.999
I'm the one who stole it.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.599
I just told you.
Be patient and trust us.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.079
Time heals all wounds, my friend.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.279
- And they've released you?
- I left.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.279
- Nothing serious then?
- No, a cracked rib and a big bruise.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.999
Where are the elderlies?

20:50.120 --> 20:54.199
Roman said to go easy on them.
They've been through a lot.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.999
Don't worry, it'll be fast.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.639
- Where are they?
- Upstairs.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.479
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Do we know each other?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.479
I grew up at Les Agnettes.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.599
- I'm Rachedi's son.
- Ah, yes.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.679
And your sister, Samira,
was a good girl.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.039
She worked at the Timone hospital.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.239
Is she still there?
And you had a brother, right?

21:20.360 --> 21:22.879
What time was it
when the guy entered your flat?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.399
Two minutes before you.

21:24.520 --> 21:29.119
He burst into our flat, forced us to get
on the bed. He put the guns under it.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.999
- Margot was petrified.
- He forced you?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.999
- No, he knocked and...
- You let him in.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.119
There's no sign of a break-in.
No sign of a break-in!

21:38.240 --> 21:41.239
No, he knocked, I answered,
he put a gun in my face.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.359
- And what was his name?
- I don't know.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.999
Of course, you know it.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.519
- What was his name?
- I don't know.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.679
- You're sure?
- Yes.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.679
You don't know?
Yes you do. His name?

21:50.800 --> 21:54.159
- I don't know.
- Him, there. What was his name?

21:55.280 --> 21:57.279
- I don't know.
- Mimo.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.599
Fréderic Mimo.
You don't know who he is?

21:59.720 --> 22:02.199
- No.
- Everyone called him Mimo. Nothing?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.639
You don't know him?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.399
And you? You know him?

22:05.520 --> 22:07.799
- No.
- You don't? Sure?

22:08.520 --> 22:12.399
For him, it was the same as the others.
At 12, he was a good kid.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.399
At 13, he was recruited as a lookout.

22:14.520 --> 22:17.839
At 14 he made runner and at 17,
he lies head smashed where?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.279
In my flat? Where? Where?

22:20.400 --> 22:21.959
- In our flat.
- Exact.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.639
- Did you help the kids in the cite?
- No.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.359
- Did you help the kids in the cite?
- No.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.279
Did you help the kids in the cite?
No?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.479
You haven't done anything?

22:41.640 --> 22:43.479
He knocked on the door.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.159
He put a gun to my face, forced us
to get in bed, hid his shit under it.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.799
- We had never seen him...
- You take me for a twat.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.319
You want to play it that way?
Fine.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.879
Things have changed at Les Agnettes.
It's not what it used to be.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.239
Yeah.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.279
Khalil! Khalil!

23:04.720 --> 23:06.199
Hurry up, Mokhtar!

23:06.320 --> 23:08.319
What do you think I'm fucking doing!

23:08.440 --> 23:09.719
Fuck, take it easy guys!

23:09.840 --> 23:11.479
Shut the fuck up!

23:12.920 --> 23:14.439
I told you to hurry up.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.519
Oh fuck!
You okay, Khalil?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.319
I'm fine, I'm fine.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.639
What a good timing.
I was looking for you.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.479
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah, a bit.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.399
- And there?
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?

23:31.520 --> 23:35.519
Do you remember when your father broke
his leg? Couldn't stop screaming.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.159
The one who said I was making a fuss
when I had his children.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.279
The Rachedi men.
You can't deal with pain.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.559
There you go.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.879
Do you remember the Belairs?
Georges and Margot.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.799
They were a bit older than us.
They lived in the middle tower.

24:02.920 --> 24:07.159
- What do you think about them?
- They were always very nice to you.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.999
Why are you asking?
Did you see them again?

24:12.800 --> 24:15.479
They might be involved in a case.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.919
Leave it. I'll get it.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.439
Look after yourself, son.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.879
Yeah. Don't worry.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.919
What are you doing here?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.999
- What do you want?
- You pissed off a lot of people.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.599
How do you know that?

24:54.720 --> 24:57.519
Watch out, brother.
People talk about you.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.639
People talk a lot about you,
and not always in a good way.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.839
You were sent to scare me or something?

25:03.200 --> 25:07.319
You've always been fucking pretentious.
Nobody sent me.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.199
The whole cite is talking about you.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.319
Maybe cause they know
who they're dealing with.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.639
Or maybe they want you dead.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.239
If they find out I came here,
I'm dead, do you get it?

25:21.720 --> 25:23.799
Are you sure they didn't send you?

25:24.520 --> 25:27.519
Just be fucking careful
about what you're doing and where.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.759
Stop being reckless.

25:37.000 --> 25:37.999
Here.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.999
Give this to mum.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.759
Tell her they're from you.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.559
I can clear up Les Agnettes.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.239
Thank you.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.799
Bravo, bravo.

28:57.320 --> 29:01.159
All this is about
a new future for Belgrade.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.879
About the future of Serbia.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.559
It is about a future
where we have a world-class airport,

29:08.680 --> 29:10.279
for a world capital.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.999
The European Union
offered us a friendly hand,

29:15.400 --> 29:19.799
so we will accept it
and we will shake it.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.639
Belgrade is open for business!

29:27.280 --> 29:29.919
You piece of shit.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.999
You politician scumbag.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.799
I'm sure you voted for him as well.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.719
Why are we here?

29:37.840 --> 29:40.399
...Mr. Guillaume Von Reeth from Plex.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.599
For him.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.799
Does he deal with guns?

29:59.720 --> 30:02.839
Cement.
He deals with cement.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.719
Thank you.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.199
They're here.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.039
- So it starts.
- What is starting?

32:09.680 --> 32:10.959
The airport deal.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.479
We want the security contract
and a few locals.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.719
There's a lot of money there.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.799
Listen.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.239
Take this and keep watch.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.879
And don't shoot on the kids, okay?

32:42.000 --> 32:42.879
Georges?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.479
It's him, right?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.279
What are you playing at?

32:50.920 --> 32:53.279
Khalil, you're going too far.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.159
Whatever works.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.359
Come on, move.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.959
Let's go.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.199
Easy, Animal.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.679
Shut up, Animal.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.119
The Animal gave us a lesson, huh?

35:12.600 --> 35:13.599
Yeah.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.159
Sure?

35:17.640 --> 35:18.999
Okay, great.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.559
- There was blood in the Belairs' room.
- And?

35:25.680 --> 35:28.559
It's from the Serb
who got shot at the jewellery.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.359
- You're joking?
- No.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.719
You were right.
He's here, in Marseille.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.159
Fuck.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.919
I knew it.

35:40.560 --> 35:45.319
- This guy, the Serb. Where is he?
- I know what you did.

35:46.640 --> 35:50.119
We're looking for him. I know he was
in your flat with the guns. Talk.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.239
I know what you did.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.759
Look, when I was at Les Agnettes
it was already bad.

35:58.880 --> 36:02.479
There was already drug dealing
and shit. But not like that.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.999
Now, all they want is to have a Glock
and play big boss.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.399
Do you realise a six year old can't
get out without risking to be shot?

36:11.080 --> 36:13.879
You made them think I was a sell-out.
You tricked me.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.999
Don't you want things to change?

36:16.840 --> 36:19.239
The white knight of Les Agnettes.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.879
Someone has to do it.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.799
- How old are you? 60, 65...
- 60.

36:27.920 --> 36:32.039
60. How much longer are you going
to continue being their mule?

36:32.160 --> 36:33.519
Their mule?

36:35.400 --> 36:39.479
Come on, I know how it works. You stash
their goods, they're nice to you.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.519
They help you make ends meet.
Nothing too nasty, I get it, but...

36:43.640 --> 36:45.399
Go fuck yourself.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.439
Georges, I know it's scary but...

36:52.920 --> 36:55.719
you have a share of responsibility,
you have to help us now.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.239
Sometimes things
are too fucked up to change.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.119
- You've made up your mind?
- Yeah.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.119
In that case,
I can't help you anymore.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.799
There you go, we got them.
We got two names.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.279
Borisav Simic and Drago Jankovic.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.879
Seems like Interpol
has been useful after all.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.959
Nothing on our Serb?

38:19.080 --> 38:21.599
- What, our Serb?
- The one I found.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.279
Well, you haven't found him actually.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.479
And we don't have a match for him
in the DNA database.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.679
But he's here.
In our city.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.559
We have proof he's connected
to Les Agnettes.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.439
We should arrest him, not Interpol.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.599
My way was working.
They may never be arrested,

38:41.720 --> 38:45.599
but we can at least tell everyone
that we know who the killers are.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.159
Give me more time with the Belairs.
I swear they'll talk.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.959
The Belairs are gone.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.119
- What do you mean gone?
- Yes, I told you to release them.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.719
We can't keep pensioners for ever.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.599
- There're gone?
- Yes.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.879
Franck!

39:05.320 --> 39:06.319
Yeah?

39:07.200 --> 39:09.119
They've just released the Belairs.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.879
We need to find them.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.719
- She's good.
- You think?

40:23.640 --> 40:25.879
She misses the Emergency room.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.159
That's better than nothing.

40:32.720 --> 40:37.519
I was sitting in the toilets
and I was stitching

40:37.640 --> 40:42.319
The officers asked me who I belonged to

40:48.240 --> 40:52.559
TN13 to Bac 130 Alpha, we have
a burglary in process at 57 Michelet.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.559
Copy that, TN13.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.759
TN13 to all fixed and mobile units,
take note.

40:59.880 --> 41:04.319
Gunshots reported on Aubagne road.
Two persons seem to be on the ground.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.959
- Do we ignore them?
- Yeah, no choice.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.119
Fuck, if they hit us, we're in trouble.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.879
If they wanted to,
they'd have done it.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.119
Anyone home?

42:02.600 --> 42:03.999
They took off.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.239
Fuck.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.199
Ask the station about the shooting.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.279
TN132TK 140.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.879
Here's TK 140, go on.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.399
Can I have details about the shooting?

42:28.520 --> 42:33.319
Two dead persons reported outside
a parked vehicle on Aubagne road.

42:33.440 --> 42:37.839
They seem to have been shot.
Units are already there.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.159
I found this in my locker.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.919
Who knows that I work there?

47:06.480 --> 47:07.999
It's addressed to you.

47:08.640 --> 47:11.159
FOR THE WHITE KNIGHT

47:15.040 --> 47:19.519
MEMBERSHIP CARD

47:21.400 --> 47:25.799
A sports club?
Someone is trying to tell you something.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.239
What's going on, Khalil?
