02:09.850 --> 02:12.600
Are you here to kill me?

02:20.270 --> 02:22.770
I know what this is.

02:23.820 --> 02:28.900
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

02:30.610 --> 02:34.490
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

02:37.500 --> 02:42.630
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.340
What is the most resilient parasite?

02:49.630 --> 02:52.970
A bacteria? A virus?

02:53.555 --> 02:54.800
An intestinal worm?

02:55.140 --> 02:56.390
Uh...

02:56.560 --> 02:58.185
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...

02:58.350 --> 02:59.560
An idea.

03:00.855 --> 03:03.360
Resilient. Highly contagious.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.625
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

03:08.610 --> 03:12.240
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.660
Right in there somewhere.

03:13.825 --> 03:15.370
For someone like you to steal?

03:15.535 --> 03:18.600
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

03:18.665 --> 03:21.100
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.500
It's called extraction.

03:22.670 --> 03:26.210
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

03:26.380 --> 03:28.880
...from even the most skilled extractor.

03:29.050 --> 03:30.220
How can you do that?

03:30.385 --> 03:33.220
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.100
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

03:37.265 --> 03:40.185
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

03:40.353 --> 03:42.688
...your defense is never down.

03:43.606 --> 03:47.526
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

03:47.694 --> 03:51.029
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

03:51.197 --> 03:53.532
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

03:53.950 --> 03:56.618
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

03:56.786 --> 03:59.121
...I need to know what's in that safe.

03:59.288 --> 04:02.749
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

04:05.628 --> 04:10.257
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

04:12.719 --> 04:13.760
He knows.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.265
What's going on up there?

05:12.528 --> 05:15.113
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

05:15.531 --> 05:17.866
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.534
The information is in the safe.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.870
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

05:23.247 --> 05:24.289
What's she doing here?

05:27.210 --> 05:30.087
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

05:30.254 --> 05:32.297
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

05:40.723 --> 05:45.393
If I jumped, would I survive?

05:47.772 --> 05:50.148
With a clean dive, perhaps.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.983
Mal, what are you doing here?

05:52.151 --> 05:54.361
I thought you might be missing me.

05:54.654 --> 05:55.821
You know that I am.

05:57.365 --> 05:59.825
But I can't trust you anymore.

06:00.576 --> 06:01.952
So what?

06:03.496 --> 06:05.705
Looks like Arthur's taste.

06:05.873 --> 06:09.501
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

06:11.212 --> 06:12.921
Please, have a seat.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.097
Tell me...

06:22.515 --> 06:24.057
...do the children miss me?

06:28.396 --> 06:30.105
You can't imagine.

06:34.277 --> 06:35.360
What are you doing?

06:35.528 --> 06:37.070
Just getting some fresh air.

06:37.488 --> 06:39.239
Stay where you are, Mal.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.796
Goddamn it.

07:56.651 --> 07:58.235
Turn around.

07:58.402 --> 07:59.444
The gun, Dom.

08:08.704 --> 08:09.829
Please.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.302
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.139
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

08:28.557 --> 08:33.520
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

08:37.650 --> 08:40.025
I want to know the name
of your employer.

08:42.029 --> 08:45.907
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

08:46.075 --> 08:48.535
That depends
on what you're threatening.

08:49.453 --> 08:51.621
Killing him would just wake him up.

08:52.373 --> 08:53.540
But pain...

08:57.503 --> 08:59.379
Pain is in the mind.

09:00.089 --> 09:04.301
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

09:15.688 --> 09:18.815
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

09:18.983 --> 09:22.402
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

09:36.625 --> 09:40.587
He was close. Very close.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.478
Stop him!

10:22.296 --> 10:24.464
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.237
He won't wake.

10:51.700 --> 10:52.992
- Give him the kick.
- What?

10:53.536 --> 10:54.577
Dunk him.

11:39.123 --> 11:40.498
He's out.

11:45.796 --> 11:47.839
You came prepared, hmm?

11:48.007 --> 11:51.843
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

11:52.511 --> 11:56.222
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

11:56.390 --> 11:58.933
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

11:59.101 --> 12:01.060
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

12:02.146 --> 12:04.230
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

12:04.398 --> 12:07.192
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.028
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

12:10.196 --> 12:13.364
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

12:13.532 --> 12:16.409
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.538
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.416
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

12:23.834 --> 12:26.127
But your deception was obvious.

13:07.002 --> 13:11.422
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

13:11.590 --> 13:15.843
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

13:16.011 --> 13:18.137
We won't last two days.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.266
Cobb?

13:21.433 --> 13:24.602
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

13:24.770 --> 13:28.523
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

13:31.902 --> 13:34.779
I've always hated this carpet.

13:35.406 --> 13:39.284
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.122
But very definitely made of wool.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.666
Right now...

13:47.710 --> 13:50.128
...l'm lying on polyester.

13:54.008 --> 13:58.845
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

13:59.722 --> 14:02.974
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

14:03.434 --> 14:05.476
I'm still dreaming.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.985
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

14:19.366 --> 14:23.494
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

14:24.747 --> 14:28.249
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.668
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

14:30.836 --> 14:32.253
We're not in your dream.

14:32.421 --> 14:34.005
We're in mine.

14:43.932 --> 14:46.017
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

14:46.185 --> 14:48.519
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.813
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

14:50.981 --> 14:52.065
That's enough.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.692
You. What the hell was all that?

14:55.194 --> 14:58.071
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

14:58.238 --> 15:02.033
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.035
He's not gonna check every compartment.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.828
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

15:05.996 --> 15:08.748
Listen. Every man for himself.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.115
Yes, hello?

16:24.324 --> 16:26.951
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.080
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

16:31.248 --> 16:33.458
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.

16:33.625 --> 16:37.378
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

16:37.546 --> 16:41.466
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

16:42.468 --> 16:47.096
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

16:47.264 --> 16:48.598
Why?

16:48.932 --> 16:54.479
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

16:54.813 --> 16:57.648
Grandma says you're never coming back.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.193
Phillipa, is that you?

17:01.153 --> 17:03.488
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

17:03.655 --> 17:05.364
She's shaking her head.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.993
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

17:10.871 --> 17:12.079
Daddy?

17:12.789 --> 17:13.830
Yeah, James?

17:13.999 --> 17:15.665
Is Mommy with you?

17:18.295 --> 17:20.505
James, we talked about this.

17:21.798 --> 17:24.133
Mommy's not here anymore.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.426
Where?

17:28.180 --> 17:30.806
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

17:30.974 --> 17:34.018
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

17:34.186 --> 17:35.186
And you be good, you be...

17:45.697 --> 17:47.907
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

17:55.082 --> 17:56.249
Hey, are you okay?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.292
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

17:58.460 --> 18:00.878
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

18:01.046 --> 18:04.298
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

18:04.466 --> 18:08.052
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?

18:08.220 --> 18:10.721
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

18:10.889 --> 18:13.349
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

18:13.517 --> 18:15.268
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

18:15.435 --> 18:18.688
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.732
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.153
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

18:26.321 --> 18:27.530
Stateside.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.240
Send my regards.

18:35.581 --> 18:39.125
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

18:41.295 --> 18:43.087
So I offer you the satisfaction.

18:47.050 --> 18:49.594
It's not the way I deal with things.

19:01.857 --> 19:04.734
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.612
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

19:22.127 --> 19:25.129
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

19:26.757 --> 19:29.133
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.510
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

19:31.678 --> 19:33.554
...why can't you plant one there instead?

19:33.722 --> 19:35.806
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.310
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

19:39.478 --> 19:40.478
Elephants.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.814
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

19:44.024 --> 19:46.984
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

19:47.152 --> 19:50.363
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

19:52.908 --> 19:55.993
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

19:56.161 --> 19:58.829
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

19:58.997 --> 20:01.040
Then you do have a choice.

20:01.208 --> 20:03.000
Then I choose to leave, sir.

20:07.881 --> 20:09.590
Tell the crew where you want to go.

20:14.846 --> 20:15.930
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

20:19.101 --> 20:21.185
How would you like to go home?

20:21.978 --> 20:25.272
To America. To your children.

20:25.691 --> 20:29.026
You can't fix that. No one can.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.446
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.078
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

20:39.246 --> 20:42.790
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

20:43.208 --> 20:46.711
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

20:46.878 --> 20:50.631
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

20:51.550 --> 20:55.094
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

20:55.804 --> 20:58.472
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.811
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

21:03.979 --> 21:05.896
...l'd need a guarantee.

21:06.064 --> 21:09.316
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.402
But I can.

21:11.987 --> 21:16.574
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

21:16.992 --> 21:20.828
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

21:20.996 --> 21:23.581
...waiting to die alone?

21:26.668 --> 21:30.963
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

21:39.097 --> 21:40.931
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

21:43.727 --> 21:45.436
This can't be done.

21:45.604 --> 21:48.898
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.608
You don't know that.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.778
I've done it before.

21:54.988 --> 21:56.155
Who'd you do it to?

22:01.411 --> 22:03.412
Why are we going to Paris?

22:04.998 --> 22:06.707
We're gonna need a new architect.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.684
You never did like your office, did you?

22:27.479 --> 22:30.523
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.652
Is it safe for you to be here?

22:35.862 --> 22:38.280
Extradition between France
and the United States...

22:38.448 --> 22:40.658
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

22:40.826 --> 22:43.577
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

22:43.745 --> 22:48.249
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

22:48.416 --> 22:51.001
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

22:51.169 --> 22:54.171
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

22:54.339 --> 22:57.174
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

22:57.342 --> 22:58.843
I never taught you to be a thief.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.220
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

23:01.388 --> 23:02.680
But after what happened...

23:02.848 --> 23:06.433
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

23:11.565 --> 23:13.065
What are you doing here, Dom?

23:15.193 --> 23:17.570
I think I found a way home.

23:17.737 --> 23:21.323
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

23:21.533 --> 23:25.953
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

23:26.746 --> 23:28.038
But I need your help.

23:28.707 --> 23:32.042
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.087
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

23:35.255 --> 23:36.714
- Money.
- Not just money.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.215
You remember.

23:38.383 --> 23:41.635
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

23:41.803 --> 23:43.554
...things that never existed...

23:43.722 --> 23:46.932
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

23:47.100 --> 23:52.271
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

23:52.439 --> 23:54.398
They don't actually come into the dream.

23:54.566 --> 23:57.860
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

23:58.028 --> 23:59.236
Design it yourself.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.407
Mal won't let me.

24:09.623 --> 24:11.749
Come back to reality, Dom.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.669
- Please.
- Reality.

24:16.046 --> 24:18.589
Those kids, your grandchildren...

24:18.757 --> 24:22.760
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

24:22.928 --> 24:26.096
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.267
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

24:33.438 --> 24:36.357
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

24:40.570 --> 24:42.571
I've got somebody better.

24:42.739 --> 24:43.781
Ariadne?

24:46.368 --> 24:48.911
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.412
Pleased to meet you.

24:50.580 --> 24:55.250
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

24:55.418 --> 24:56.460
A work placement?

24:56.836 --> 24:58.128
Not exactly.

24:58.296 --> 24:59.630
I have a test for you.

25:00.382 --> 25:02.466
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

25:02.634 --> 25:05.260
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

25:05.428 --> 25:08.639
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

25:11.726 --> 25:16.397
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

25:18.316 --> 25:19.483
Stop.

25:21.903 --> 25:23.112
Again.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.573
Stop.

25:29.744 --> 25:31.829
You're gonna have to do better than that.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.093
That's more like it.

26:06.281 --> 26:09.199
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.035
Now, that's when we're awake.

26:11.202 --> 26:14.204
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

26:14.372 --> 26:15.372
Such as?

26:15.540 --> 26:19.543
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

26:19.711 --> 26:23.547
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.716
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.135
Genuine inspiration, right?

26:28.303 --> 26:31.638
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

26:31.806 --> 26:36.435
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

26:36.603 --> 26:40.022
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

26:40.190 --> 26:42.900
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.444
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

26:45.612 --> 26:47.237
Now, this is where I need you.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.782
You create the world of the dream.

26:49.949 --> 26:55.329
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

26:55.497 --> 27:00.167
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

27:00.335 --> 27:03.796
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

27:03.963 --> 27:07.674
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

27:09.135 --> 27:10.552
Let me ask you a question.

27:10.720 --> 27:14.098
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

27:14.265 --> 27:17.309
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

27:17.477 --> 27:18.519
I guess, yeah.

27:18.686 --> 27:20.270
So how did we end up here?

27:20.647 --> 27:22.731
Well, we just came from the, uh...

27:22.941 --> 27:26.360
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

27:26.945 --> 27:28.862
Where are you right now?

27:32.158 --> 27:33.325
We're dreaming?

27:33.493 --> 27:35.953
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

27:36.121 --> 27:39.081
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

28:16.411 --> 28:18.537
If it's just a dream,
then why are you...?

28:20.165 --> 28:21.915
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

28:22.083 --> 28:25.377
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

28:25.545 --> 28:27.754
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

28:27.922 --> 28:31.633
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

28:31.801 --> 28:32.926
...and then wake up.

28:33.219 --> 28:35.012
How did architects become involved?

28:35.180 --> 28:37.931
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

28:39.058 --> 28:40.350
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

28:42.395 --> 28:46.356
Five minutes? What...? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.775
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

28:48.943 --> 28:51.778
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

28:51.946 --> 28:55.324
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

28:56.034 --> 28:59.119
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

29:05.043 --> 29:07.961
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

29:08.129 --> 29:09.796
Almost everything else is here too.

29:09.964 --> 29:12.883
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.218
- Yours?
- Yes.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.929
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

29:17.096 --> 29:19.765
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

29:19.933 --> 29:21.850
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

29:22.018 --> 29:24.895
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.355
How else do you do it?

29:26.564 --> 29:30.525
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

29:30.693 --> 29:34.404
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

29:34.572 --> 29:37.366
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

29:37.533 --> 29:38.575
Well...

29:38.743 --> 29:43.247
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

29:43.414 --> 29:45.249
...but it's more about the feel of it.

29:45.750 --> 29:49.878
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

30:31.212 --> 30:32.796
It's something, isn't it?

30:33.881 --> 30:35.173
Yes, it is.

30:59.073 --> 31:00.657
Why are they all looking at me?

31:00.825 --> 31:04.328
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

31:04.495 --> 31:08.790
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

31:08.958 --> 31:10.000
Converge?

31:10.168 --> 31:12.252
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

31:12.420 --> 31:15.088
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

31:15.256 --> 31:18.091
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

31:18.676 --> 31:20.177
Just you.

31:24.140 --> 31:28.393
This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

31:31.898 --> 31:34.858
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

31:35.026 --> 31:37.694
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

32:31.374 --> 32:32.749
Very impressive.

32:44.470 --> 32:48.014
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

32:48.182 --> 32:50.517
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

32:50.685 --> 32:54.104
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.106
You draw from stuff you know, right?

32:56.274 --> 33:00.485
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

33:00.653 --> 33:02.779
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

33:02.947 --> 33:06.450
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

33:06.617 --> 33:08.702
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

33:08.870 --> 33:10.871
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

33:11.038 --> 33:12.998
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

33:13.166 --> 33:15.709
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

33:15.877 --> 33:17.502
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

33:17.670 --> 33:19.629
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

33:20.131 --> 33:22.215
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

33:22.383 --> 33:24.176
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

33:24.343 --> 33:25.844
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

33:27.472 --> 33:31.475
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

33:31.642 --> 33:34.853
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

33:35.146 --> 33:36.771
There was still time on the clock.

33:36.939 --> 33:39.483
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.234
- She'll need a totem.
- What?

33:41.402 --> 33:42.861
A totem, it's a small personal...

33:43.029 --> 33:45.572
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

33:45.740 --> 33:47.574
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

33:47.742 --> 33:50.368
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

33:50.536 --> 33:54.289
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

33:54.457 --> 33:56.917
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

33:57.084 --> 33:58.335
- Like a coin?
- No.

33:58.503 --> 34:03.173
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

34:04.258 --> 34:07.177
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

34:07.345 --> 34:11.514
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.516
That way,
when you look at your totem...

34:13.684 --> 34:16.811
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

34:20.233 --> 34:24.527
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

34:24.695 --> 34:28.239
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

34:28.407 --> 34:32.369
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

34:38.501 --> 34:41.878
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

34:42.380 --> 34:46.550
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...

34:47.217 --> 34:49.886
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.347
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

34:52.514 --> 34:55.641
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.394
It's a necessary risk.

34:57.812 --> 35:01.064
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

35:02.191 --> 35:03.233
We need a forger.

35:11.909 --> 35:14.494
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

35:15.079 --> 35:16.079
You never know.

35:17.039 --> 35:19.082
I'm gonna get you a drink.

35:21.252 --> 35:22.586
You're buying.

35:29.093 --> 35:31.386
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

35:31.554 --> 35:33.513
How's your handwriting?

35:33.681 --> 35:35.515
- It's versatile.
- Good.

35:35.683 --> 35:36.933
Thank you very much.

35:37.602 --> 35:38.935
Inception.

35:39.186 --> 35:42.022
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me...

35:42.189 --> 35:45.483
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

35:45.651 --> 35:48.945
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

35:49.363 --> 35:52.324
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

35:52.491 --> 35:54.200
He is good at what he does, right?

35:54.368 --> 35:56.453
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

35:56.621 --> 35:57.621
Not like you.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.790
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

36:00.958 --> 36:04.502
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

36:04.670 --> 36:08.298
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

36:08.466 --> 36:11.801
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.970
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

36:14.138 --> 36:17.807
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.518
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

36:20.686 --> 36:24.898
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

36:25.066 --> 36:27.484
Right there you have
various political motivations...

36:27.652 --> 36:29.653
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.655
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

36:31.822 --> 36:34.699
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

36:34.867 --> 36:37.369
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

36:37.536 --> 36:39.120
Which is what?

36:39.622 --> 36:41.498
The relationship with the father.

36:43.709 --> 36:45.377
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

36:45.544 --> 36:48.630
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

36:48.798 --> 36:52.217
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

36:52.385 --> 36:53.677
Why don't you take me there?

36:53.844 --> 36:56.930
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

36:57.098 --> 36:58.556
Cobol Engineering.

36:58.724 --> 37:01.059
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

37:01.227 --> 37:03.770
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

37:03.938 --> 37:07.565
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

37:07.733 --> 37:09.734
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

37:12.279 --> 37:13.613
All right.

37:14.782 --> 37:16.616
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

37:16.784 --> 37:18.243
My God, it's you, isn't it?

37:21.789 --> 37:22.872
No, it isn't you.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.457
Not dreaming now, are you?

37:26.669 --> 37:28.253
Get him!

37:43.769 --> 37:44.894
There!

38:05.416 --> 38:07.167
One café.

38:11.505 --> 38:12.672
Shh.

38:18.304 --> 38:19.763
One café.

38:20.806 --> 38:22.265
One café.

39:16.862 --> 39:18.321
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

39:19.949 --> 39:24.035
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

39:26.539 --> 39:29.499
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

39:29.667 --> 39:30.667
Different tail.

39:39.385 --> 39:41.135
Cobb said you'd be back.

39:42.263 --> 39:45.807
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

39:45.975 --> 39:47.642
It's just...

39:49.144 --> 39:50.478
...pure creation.

39:50.646 --> 39:53.147
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

39:53.315 --> 39:55.316
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

39:55.484 --> 39:59.028
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

39:59.196 --> 40:00.613
What kind of tricks?

40:00.781 --> 40:04.284
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

40:04.451 --> 40:08.371
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

40:08.539 --> 40:09.706
The infinite staircase.

40:13.919 --> 40:15.378
See?

40:19.550 --> 40:20.592
Paradox.

40:20.759 --> 40:22.176
So a closed loop like that...

40:22.344 --> 40:25.430
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

40:25.598 --> 40:27.557
But how big do these levels have to be?

40:27.725 --> 40:30.893
It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.

40:31.061 --> 40:34.480
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

40:34.648 --> 40:36.065
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

40:36.233 --> 40:37.567
And the better the maze...

40:37.735 --> 40:40.403
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

40:40.571 --> 40:41.863
Exactly.

40:42.531 --> 40:45.742
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

40:47.828 --> 40:49.245
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.497
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

40:53.334 --> 40:55.168
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

40:55.336 --> 40:57.754
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

40:57.921 --> 40:59.005
Why?

40:59.173 --> 41:01.424
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

41:01.842 --> 41:04.135
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

41:04.303 --> 41:07.472
- They're still together?
- No.

41:08.724 --> 41:10.224
No, she's dead.

41:12.186 --> 41:14.937
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

41:18.442 --> 41:19.942
What was she like in real life?

41:20.611 --> 41:21.986
She was lovely.

41:25.824 --> 41:28.201
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

41:28.369 --> 41:30.495
To formulate compounds for a job?

41:31.163 --> 41:33.039
And to go into the field with us.

41:33.207 --> 41:35.458
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

41:35.626 --> 41:39.337
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

41:39.505 --> 41:41.631
- Which are?
- Great depth.

41:41.799 --> 41:45.051
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

41:47.805 --> 41:48.846
Three.

41:49.014 --> 41:52.600
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

41:52.768 --> 41:56.729
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

41:56.897 --> 41:59.565
A powerful sedative.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.611
- How many team members?
- Five.

42:03.779 --> 42:05.488
Six.

42:06.365 --> 42:10.410
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

42:10.577 --> 42:13.663
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

42:13.831 --> 42:16.207
This time, it seems there is.

42:17.167 --> 42:20.878
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

42:21.046 --> 42:23.172
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

42:27.511 --> 42:29.220
Perhaps you will not want to see.

42:32.182 --> 42:33.766
After you.

42:43.068 --> 42:46.070
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

42:46.238 --> 42:48.030
They come every day to share the dream.

42:51.034 --> 42:53.619
You see? Very stable.

42:59.334 --> 43:03.379
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

43:03.672 --> 43:04.714
In dream time?

43:04.882 --> 43:08.551
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

43:08.719 --> 43:12.013
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

43:13.557 --> 43:15.975
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

43:16.143 --> 43:18.060
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

43:18.729 --> 43:22.106
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.

43:23.859 --> 43:26.569
They come to be woken up.

43:27.571 --> 43:30.865
The dream has become their reality.

43:31.784 --> 43:34.160
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

43:36.455 --> 43:38.080
Let's see what you can do.

43:49.092 --> 43:50.676
You know how to find me.

43:53.263 --> 43:55.264
You know what you have to do.

44:00.521 --> 44:01.604
Sharp, no?

44:17.162 --> 44:19.997
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

44:20.541 --> 44:24.293
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

44:32.761 --> 44:36.472
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.516
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

44:38.684 --> 44:40.309
That's not your concern.

44:40.686 --> 44:45.064
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

44:45.232 --> 44:46.816
You asked me for inception.

44:46.984 --> 44:50.361
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

44:50.529 --> 44:54.490
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

44:54.658 --> 44:56.534
This idea will define him.

44:56.702 --> 44:58.536
It may come to change...

44:58.704 --> 45:00.997
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

45:01.164 --> 45:05.501
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

45:05.669 --> 45:07.753
And we can no longer compete.

45:07.921 --> 45:11.382
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

45:11.550 --> 45:13.926
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

45:15.345 --> 45:18.681
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

45:18.849 --> 45:20.391
That's where we come in.

45:20.559 --> 45:23.853
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

45:24.021 --> 45:26.731
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

45:26.899 --> 45:29.400
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

45:29.568 --> 45:32.778
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

45:32.946 --> 45:37.116
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

45:37.284 --> 45:40.536
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

45:40.704 --> 45:45.207
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

45:45.834 --> 45:48.753
I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

45:48.921 --> 45:50.046
Mr. Browning...

45:50.213 --> 45:54.050
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

45:56.595 --> 46:01.057
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

46:01.224 --> 46:02.642
Not sure that's necessary.

46:02.809 --> 46:05.478
No, no, no. I think we should.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.334
How is he?

46:29.169 --> 46:31.921
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but...

46:32.089 --> 46:37.593
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...

46:37.844 --> 46:40.930
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

46:41.306 --> 46:44.934
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

46:46.228 --> 46:47.895
Leave that.

46:51.608 --> 46:52.942
Here.

46:55.237 --> 46:57.613
Must be a cherished memory of his.

46:58.740 --> 47:03.285
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

47:03.453 --> 47:05.121
Robert...

47:07.457 --> 47:09.875
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

47:10.043 --> 47:13.337
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

47:17.342 --> 47:19.135
The vultures are circling.

47:19.302 --> 47:23.723
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

47:23.890 --> 47:26.308
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

47:26.935 --> 47:31.313
...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

47:31.481 --> 47:35.317
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

47:35.485 --> 47:38.738
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

47:38.905 --> 47:40.740
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

47:40.907 --> 47:44.410
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

47:44.578 --> 47:46.495
So he gives himself the idea.

47:46.663 --> 47:50.916
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

47:51.084 --> 47:54.503
Eames, I am impressed.

47:54.671 --> 47:58.215
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

48:19.571 --> 48:21.572
Were you going under on your own?

48:21.740 --> 48:25.242
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

48:25.410 --> 48:27.369
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

48:27.537 --> 48:30.206
Yeah, I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.

48:30.373 --> 48:31.540
Here, let me take a look.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.044
So you're learning, huh?

48:35.212 --> 48:38.714
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

48:39.341 --> 48:41.717
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

48:41.968 --> 48:44.053
It was Mal's, actually. This...

48:44.721 --> 48:48.516
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

48:48.725 --> 48:51.602
Just spin and spin.

48:53.146 --> 48:55.064
Arthur told me she passed away.

48:56.983 --> 48:59.068
How are the mazes coming along?

48:59.236 --> 49:02.113
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

49:02.280 --> 49:03.739
...that we are trying to access.

49:03.907 --> 49:09.370
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

49:09.746 --> 49:12.498
You know, l... Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

49:12.666 --> 49:17.419
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

49:17.587 --> 49:18.754
Why is that so important?

49:18.922 --> 49:20.923
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

49:21.091 --> 49:23.425
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

49:24.803 --> 49:27.263
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

49:27.430 --> 49:29.849
You can't keep her out, can you?

49:30.767 --> 49:32.268
- Right.
- You can't build...

49:32.435 --> 49:35.771
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

49:35.939 --> 49:38.107
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

49:38.275 --> 49:41.110
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

49:41.278 --> 49:43.487
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

49:43.655 --> 49:45.614
No one said it's getting worse.

49:46.783 --> 49:50.119
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

49:50.954 --> 49:53.038
Why can't you go home?

49:56.126 --> 49:58.169
Because they think I killed her.

50:01.423 --> 50:03.674
- Thank you.
- For what?

50:03.884 --> 50:06.135
For not asking whether I did.

50:06.303 --> 50:08.470
"I will split up my father's empire."

50:08.638 --> 50:12.850
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

50:13.018 --> 50:15.811
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

50:15.979 --> 50:19.523
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

50:19.691 --> 50:23.485
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

50:23.653 --> 50:26.071
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

50:26.239 --> 50:29.825
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

50:29.993 --> 50:32.745
...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

50:32.913 --> 50:36.498
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

50:36.666 --> 50:40.169
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

50:40.545 --> 50:44.256
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

50:44.424 --> 50:48.177
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

50:48.345 --> 50:50.179
All right, well, try this. Um...

50:50.347 --> 50:55.100
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

50:55.518 --> 50:56.560
That might work.

50:56.728 --> 50:59.897
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

51:00.065 --> 51:02.024
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

51:02.192 --> 51:05.152
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

51:05.362 --> 51:06.445
Specificity?

51:06.613 --> 51:08.447
Inception's not about being specific.

51:08.615 --> 51:12.576
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

51:13.870 --> 51:16.872
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

51:17.040 --> 51:20.125
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

51:20.293 --> 51:24.964
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

51:25.131 --> 51:28.467
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

51:28.635 --> 51:31.053
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.

51:32.389 --> 51:36.392
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

51:36.559 --> 51:37.726
Sedation.

51:37.894 --> 51:40.729
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

51:40.897 --> 51:44.817
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

51:56.246 --> 51:57.329
Good night.

51:57.914 --> 52:00.124
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

52:00.292 --> 52:02.251
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

52:02.419 --> 52:06.630
...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

52:06.798 --> 52:09.925
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

52:10.135 --> 52:13.637
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

52:13.805 --> 52:15.931
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...

52:16.099 --> 52:18.976
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

52:19.144 --> 52:21.812
It's a week, the first level down.

52:22.522 --> 52:25.357
Six months the second level down,
and the third level...

52:25.525 --> 52:26.942
That's 10 years.

52:29.612 --> 52:31.780
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

52:32.157 --> 52:33.324
Depends on the dream.

52:33.491 --> 52:35.784
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

52:35.952 --> 52:39.288
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

52:39.456 --> 52:42.249
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

52:42.417 --> 52:45.127
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

52:47.255 --> 52:49.965
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

52:50.133 --> 52:53.344
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

52:53.511 --> 52:54.720
That's the clever part.

52:54.888 --> 52:58.140
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

52:58.308 --> 53:03.145
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

53:03.313 --> 53:05.647
Or tipping.

53:06.316 --> 53:10.486
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

53:10.987 --> 53:14.531
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

53:22.415 --> 53:25.918
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

53:26.086 --> 53:28.087
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

53:28.254 --> 53:31.507
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need...

53:31.674 --> 53:33.592
We need at least a good 10 hours.

53:33.760 --> 53:35.094
Sydney to Los Angeles.

53:36.429 --> 53:40.682
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

53:40.850 --> 53:43.018
He must be flying private, then.

53:43.520 --> 53:46.688
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

53:46.856 --> 53:49.108
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

53:49.275 --> 53:50.734
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

53:50.902 --> 53:54.113
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.783
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

53:57.951 --> 53:59.535
I bought the airline.

54:01.079 --> 54:02.871
It seemed neater.

54:04.499 --> 54:07.292
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

54:07.961 --> 54:11.088
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

54:59.095 --> 55:01.263
You know how to find me.

55:02.765 --> 55:04.183
You know what you have to do.

55:08.021 --> 55:11.482
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

55:12.358 --> 55:14.401
Of course I do.

55:15.487 --> 55:17.988
You said you had a dream.

55:20.950 --> 55:23.702
That we'd grow old together.

55:25.121 --> 55:26.830
And we can.

55:33.505 --> 55:35.464
You shouldn't be here.

55:39.219 --> 55:42.679
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

55:42.847 --> 55:46.058
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

55:46.226 --> 55:52.022
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

56:02.909 --> 56:05.327
Why do you do this to yourself?

56:05.495 --> 56:08.413
It's the only way I can still dream.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.376
Why is it so important to dream?

56:13.294 --> 56:15.546
In my dreams, we're still together.

56:29.894 --> 56:31.645
These aren't just dreams.

56:33.439 --> 56:36.483
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

56:36.651 --> 56:37.693
I know I did.

56:38.361 --> 56:42.864
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

56:43.032 --> 56:46.034
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

56:46.202 --> 56:48.787
They're memories that I have to change.

56:50.039 --> 56:52.499
Well, what's down there that you regret?

56:52.875 --> 56:56.044
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

57:04.512 --> 57:06.096
This is your house?

57:06.764 --> 57:09.224
Mine and Mal's, yes.

57:09.392 --> 57:11.101
Where is she?

57:11.769 --> 57:13.770
She's already gone.

57:18.526 --> 57:20.068
That's my son, James.

57:20.236 --> 57:23.322
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

57:24.699 --> 57:25.824
That's Phillipa.

57:26.367 --> 57:28.243
I thought about calling out to them...

57:28.411 --> 57:31.163
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

57:31.873 --> 57:37.002
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

57:37.170 --> 57:40.005
Right now or never, Cobb.

57:44.469 --> 57:46.261
Then I start to panic.

57:46.429 --> 57:49.139
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

57:49.974 --> 57:52.309
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

57:52.477 --> 57:54.978
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

57:55.146 --> 57:57.189
But the moment's past.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.778
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

58:03.655 --> 58:05.822
As I'm about to call out to them...

58:06.866 --> 58:07.949
...they run away.

58:10.703 --> 58:13.955
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

58:14.999 --> 58:16.500
The real world.

58:58.084 --> 58:59.543
What are you doing here?

59:00.378 --> 59:01.503
My name is...

59:01.671 --> 59:04.965
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

59:13.141 --> 59:15.559
I'm just trying to understand.

59:15.727 --> 59:17.853
How could you understand?

59:19.063 --> 59:21.189
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

59:23.192 --> 59:25.360
To be half of a whole?

59:26.571 --> 59:28.155
No.

59:29.615 --> 59:31.616
I'll tell you a riddle.

59:33.077 --> 59:35.370
You're waiting for a train.

59:36.414 --> 59:39.583
A train that will take you far away.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.920
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

59:44.964 --> 59:47.215
...but you don't know for sure.

59:47.383 --> 59:49.301
But it doesn't matter.

59:50.261 --> 59:53.680
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

59:53.848 --> 59:55.599
Because you'll be together.

59:56.642 --> 59:59.728
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

01:00:00.146 --> 01:00:03.315
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

01:00:03.483 --> 01:00:04.816
What happened here?

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:09.571
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:12.073
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:15.452
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.079
I'll come back for you. I promise.

01:00:36.307 --> 01:00:41.686
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

01:00:42.313 --> 01:00:44.689
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.858
It's time.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.445
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:52.781
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:56.201
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

01:00:56.369 --> 01:00:57.828
All right.

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:01.456
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:04.793
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

01:01:07.338 --> 01:01:09.506
And it doesn't have to be me...

01:01:09.674 --> 01:01:12.968
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

01:01:18.766 --> 01:01:20.475
Get us another seat on the plane.

01:01:24.522 --> 01:01:27.566
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

01:01:27.733 --> 01:01:31.403
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

01:01:32.071 --> 01:01:34.281
Complete the job en route...

01:01:34.448 --> 01:01:36.908
...I make one phone call from the plane...

01:01:37.076 --> 01:01:39.995
...you have no trouble
getting through lmmigration.

01:01:53.718 --> 01:01:56.219
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

01:01:56.387 --> 01:01:57.971
Thank you.

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:34.883
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.927
Would you care for a drink?

01:02:37.094 --> 01:02:38.386
Oh. Water, please.

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:40.889
Oh, um, same, please.

01:02:41.849 --> 01:02:43.141
Um...

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:44.976
Thank you.

01:02:45.144 --> 01:02:47.020
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

01:02:47.188 --> 01:02:50.774
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

01:02:50.942 --> 01:02:52.442
Yes, he, um...

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.403
He was my father.

01:02:55.821 --> 01:02:59.866
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:03:02.828 --> 01:03:04.496
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:03:04.664 --> 01:03:05.997
Hey.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.041
To your father.

01:03:08.626 --> 01:03:10.877
May he rest in peace, huh?

01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:21.656
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.867
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

01:04:24.035 --> 01:04:25.160
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:28.288
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:44.012
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...?
- Walk away.

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.279
Just have him ca... I gotta go.

01:05:01.447 --> 01:05:03.573
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:09.370
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

01:05:09.955 --> 01:05:12.290
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

01:05:12.458 --> 01:05:13.958
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

01:05:14.126 --> 01:05:16.961
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this...?

01:05:19.924 --> 01:05:21.257
Great.

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.680
Come on.

01:05:38.776 --> 01:05:41.402
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.279
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

01:05:43.447 --> 01:05:44.572
I'm afraid that it doesn't...

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.084
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:57.877
What the hell is going on?

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.842
This wasn't in the design.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.136
Cobb?

01:06:06.387 --> 01:06:07.428
Cobb?

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.522
Get him!

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:07.655
Are you all right?

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.991
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.076
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

01:07:12.244 --> 01:07:13.494
Saito?

01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:34.515
Get Fischer in the back room now.

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:37.518
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

01:07:37.978 --> 01:07:39.437
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

01:07:39.605 --> 01:07:41.356
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:43.942
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:46.069
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

01:07:46.236 --> 01:07:47.862
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.697
Why the hell were we ambushed?

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:52.283
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.995
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

01:07:56.163 --> 01:08:00.375
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

01:08:00.542 --> 01:08:02.168
It should've shown in the research.

01:08:02.336 --> 01:08:04.128
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:05.630
Don't tell me to calm down!

01:08:05.798 --> 01:08:08.716
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.969
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

01:08:11.136 --> 01:08:14.472
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.724
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.725
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:19.935
Put him out his misery.

01:08:20.104 --> 01:08:22.939
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

01:08:23.107 --> 01:08:25.233
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.276
No. It won't wake him up.

01:08:27.444 --> 01:08:31.072
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.490
Not from this.

01:08:32.658 --> 01:08:35.201
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

01:08:35.786 --> 01:08:37.495
Right. So, what happens when we die?

01:08:37.662 --> 01:08:39.497
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

01:08:39.665 --> 01:08:42.207
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:45.627
- What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

01:08:45.796 --> 01:08:49.006
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:52.093
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.136
Which, in our case, is just you.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:57.015
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

01:08:57.182 --> 01:08:59.600
...trying to escape until the sedation...
- How long?

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:02.979
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

01:09:03.147 --> 01:09:04.354
Let's get him upstairs.

01:09:05.983 --> 01:09:07.442
Great.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.944
Thank you.

01:09:10.612 --> 01:09:13.865
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:15.491
And if we get killed...

01:09:15.658 --> 01:09:18.911
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.627
Someone got first aid?

01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:33.341
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:36.470
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

01:09:36.638 --> 01:09:38.973
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.142
You knew about this
and went along with it?

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.350
I trusted him.

01:09:42.519 --> 01:09:44.437
When? When he promised you
half his share?

01:09:44.604 --> 01:09:47.857
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

01:09:48.024 --> 01:09:50.109
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

01:09:50.277 --> 01:09:53.696
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

01:09:53.863 --> 01:09:55.782
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

01:09:55.949 --> 01:09:59.994
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:02.497
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

01:10:02.664 --> 01:10:05.124
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

01:10:05.292 --> 01:10:07.168
I am sitting this one out on this level.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.754
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:12.173
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:16.094
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

01:10:16.678 --> 01:10:20.473
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:24.519
Downwards is the only way forwards.

01:10:26.063 --> 01:10:27.188
Get ready.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.524
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:37.448
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

01:10:37.616 --> 01:10:40.535
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:42.995
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

01:10:43.163 --> 01:10:45.206
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:48.000
I don't know any safe.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.045
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

01:10:52.714 --> 01:10:54.048
Tell us what it is.

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.634
I don't know.

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.724
We have it on good authority
you do know.

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:06.227
Yeah? Whose authority?

01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:11.232
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

01:11:11.483 --> 01:11:15.236
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

01:11:20.284 --> 01:11:21.784
Useful?

01:11:22.536 --> 01:11:23.578
Maybe.

01:11:24.037 --> 01:11:25.830
You're on. You've got an hour.

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:27.248
An hour?

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.835
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

01:11:31.003 --> 01:11:33.588
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:36.924
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:41.929
- What's that?
- Good authority.

01:11:46.143 --> 01:11:47.852
Uncle Peter.

01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:50.688
Just make them stop.

01:11:50.981 --> 01:11:53.316
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:56.152
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.779
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

01:12:01.158 --> 01:12:03.868
You have one hour. Start talking.

01:12:05.871 --> 01:12:07.079
You all right?

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:10.291
You okay?

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:17.632
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.801
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.803
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.723
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

01:12:25.891 --> 01:12:28.643
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

01:12:29.394 --> 01:12:32.647
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

01:12:32.814 --> 01:12:35.316
No, he never gave me any combination.

01:12:36.068 --> 01:12:40.196
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:41.572
Well, what, then?

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.283
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

01:12:44.451 --> 01:12:48.371
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

01:12:50.082 --> 01:12:54.001
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

01:12:54.753 --> 01:12:56.212
Perhaps after your mother died.

01:12:58.882 --> 01:13:01.592
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

01:13:03.262 --> 01:13:08.224
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

01:13:08.392 --> 01:13:10.726
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

01:13:10.894 --> 01:13:13.604
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:17.608
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

01:13:17.776 --> 01:13:21.362
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:22.780
And if he dies?

01:13:23.949 --> 01:13:25.408
Worst-case scenario?

01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:28.286
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

01:13:28.453 --> 01:13:32.540
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.375
I appreciate that, Saito.

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:38.629
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

01:13:38.797 --> 01:13:40.840
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

01:13:41.008 --> 01:13:44.760
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.554
Filled with regret?

01:13:48.015 --> 01:13:49.098
Waiting to die alone.

01:13:49.766 --> 01:13:50.891
No.

01:13:51.435 --> 01:13:53.060
I'll come back.

01:13:53.895 --> 01:13:56.564
And we'll be young men together again.

01:14:02.529 --> 01:14:03.571
Breathe.

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:06.782
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:08.868
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

01:14:09.036 --> 01:14:12.913
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.582
All right. What is in the safe?

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:16.834
Something for you.

01:14:17.461 --> 01:14:21.589
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

01:14:22.341 --> 01:14:25.426
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.802
That's an alternate.

01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:29.347
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

01:14:29.514 --> 01:14:32.141
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

01:14:32.309 --> 01:14:36.020
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

01:14:36.188 --> 01:14:38.647
Destroying my whole inheritance?

01:14:40.317 --> 01:14:43.486
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

01:14:46.365 --> 01:14:48.324
He loved you, Robert.

01:14:48.909 --> 01:14:50.534
In his own way.

01:14:50.702 --> 01:14:52.495
In his own way.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.331
At the end...

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.793
...he called me in to his deathbed.

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.128
He could barely speak.

01:15:02.214 --> 01:15:06.467
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.596
He pulled me close.

01:15:13.266 --> 01:15:15.351
And I could only make out...

01:15:16.228 --> 01:15:17.645
...one word.

01:15:21.358 --> 01:15:23.317
"Disappointed."

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:30.157
When were you in limbo?

01:15:31.743 --> 01:15:35.246
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

01:15:35.414 --> 01:15:37.790
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

01:15:37.999 --> 01:15:42.128
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

01:15:42.295 --> 01:15:46.340
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.926
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

01:15:49.094 --> 01:15:50.886
...we're also going deeper into you.

01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:55.015
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.479
We were working together.

01:16:00.647 --> 01:16:04.316
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:05.776
I kept pushing things.

01:16:05.944 --> 01:16:09.613
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

01:16:10.115 --> 01:16:14.994
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

01:16:15.162 --> 01:16:17.872
...that we could get trapped so deep...

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:22.042
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

01:16:22.627 --> 01:16:25.171
...we lost sight of what was real.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.804
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

01:16:35.432 --> 01:16:37.433
We did that for years.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.561
We built our own world.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.606
How long were you stuck there?

01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:46.901
Something like 50 years.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.447
Jesus.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:55.075
How could you stand it?

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.995
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

01:16:58.163 --> 01:17:01.207
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

01:17:01.374 --> 01:17:05.753
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.338
And what about for her?

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.720
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

01:17:16.097 --> 01:17:21.352
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:26.774
Limbo became her reality.

01:17:28.109 --> 01:17:29.944
What happened when you woke up?

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:34.114
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.703
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:44.375
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

01:17:45.752 --> 01:17:48.003
Eventually, she told me the truth.

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:51.799
She was possessed by an idea.

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:57.680
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:01.308
That our world wasn't real.

01:18:02.227 --> 01:18:06.480
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

01:18:07.023 --> 01:18:09.400
...that in order to get back home...

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:12.444
...we had to kill ourselves.

01:18:19.077 --> 01:18:22.538
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

01:18:22.706 --> 01:18:25.708
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:27.585
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.

01:18:27.752 --> 01:18:29.003
I can tell the difference.

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:31.505
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.382
You don't know you're dreaming!

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:35.759
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:39.763
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

01:18:42.726 --> 01:18:45.769
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

01:18:45.937 --> 01:18:52.443
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

01:19:18.511 --> 01:19:21.305
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

01:19:21.473 --> 01:19:25.726
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:30.356
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

01:19:30.523 --> 01:19:32.232
No, I'm not.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.485
Now, you listen to me.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:39.323
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:41.408
Now, just step back inside.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.328
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

01:19:44.496 --> 01:19:46.413
We've talked enough.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.167
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

01:19:50.335 --> 01:19:53.045
...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.093
We're gonna talk about this.

01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:01.136
All right?

01:20:01.304 --> 01:20:06.392
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

01:20:07.352 --> 01:20:10.354
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

01:20:10.522 --> 01:20:13.273
Take a second, think about our children.

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.192
Think about James.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.569
Think about Phillipa, now.

01:20:17.737 --> 01:20:20.656
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

01:20:20.824 --> 01:20:24.118
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

01:20:24.577 --> 01:20:27.913
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.292
How you've threatened to kill me.

01:20:35.088 --> 01:20:37.715
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

01:20:37.882 --> 01:20:39.633
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:42.678
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

01:20:42.846 --> 01:20:45.889
We're going home to our real children.

01:20:46.057 --> 01:20:49.685
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

01:20:49.853 --> 01:20:51.145
You're waiting for a train.

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:55.232
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.401
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

01:20:57.569 --> 01:21:01.405
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

01:21:01.573 --> 01:21:03.782
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:07.161
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

01:21:07.328 --> 01:21:11.165
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

01:21:11.332 --> 01:21:12.750
Jesus Christ!

01:21:16.254 --> 01:21:20.007
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:24.344
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:25.763
So I ran.

01:21:27.599 --> 01:21:29.850
Right now, or never, Cobb.

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:40.861
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

01:21:41.112 --> 01:21:42.196
All right, let's go.

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:46.533
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:50.954
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

01:21:51.122 --> 01:21:54.416
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

01:21:55.668 --> 01:21:58.212
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:03.383
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:05.385
But you don't have to do that alone.

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.805
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

01:22:08.473 --> 01:22:13.560
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:20.150
We have to move.

01:22:20.318 --> 01:22:21.735
Time's up.

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:24.655
All right. I don't know any combination.

01:22:24.823 --> 01:22:27.908
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:32.037
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

01:22:32.205 --> 01:22:35.082
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.501
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:39.920
I said, right now! Right now!

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:43.966
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

01:22:47.846 --> 01:22:49.847
You'll have to do better than that.

01:22:50.014 --> 01:22:53.350
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:01.859
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:08.615
What'd you get?

01:23:09.033 --> 01:23:11.577
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

01:23:11.744 --> 01:23:12.786
This helps us how?

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:16.039
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:20.335
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

01:23:20.503 --> 01:23:24.047
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

01:23:24.215 --> 01:23:27.801
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

01:24:02.879 --> 01:24:03.921
Damn it.

01:24:04.088 --> 01:24:07.090
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.860
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:31.031
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:33.533
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:36.703
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:39.206
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:41.875
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

01:24:42.293 --> 01:24:43.710
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:47.422
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:49.716
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:52.219
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:55.889
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:58.058
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:00.352
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.729
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.940
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

01:25:05.108 --> 01:25:07.567
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

01:25:12.115 --> 01:25:15.492
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.954
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

01:25:19.122 --> 01:25:20.914
- You ready?
- Ready!

01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:23.250
Sweet dreams.

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.335
Am I boring you?

01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:29.840
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

01:25:31.676 --> 01:25:34.344
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

01:25:35.888 --> 01:25:37.472
There goes Mr. Charles.

01:25:42.186 --> 01:25:44.813
Mr. Fischer, right?

01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:48.483
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. L...

01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:49.776
Hmm.

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:52.612
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

01:25:55.867 --> 01:25:56.992
In case you get bored.

01:26:02.248 --> 01:26:03.623
Must've blown you off.

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:06.501
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

01:26:08.671 --> 01:26:13.133
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

01:26:17.055 --> 01:26:19.389
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500...

01:26:19.557 --> 01:26:20.682
About $500, right?

01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:23.810
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:25.937
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:29.816
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.318
And why don't you approve?

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:33.487
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

01:26:33.654 --> 01:26:35.822
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:38.909
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

01:26:39.077 --> 01:26:40.827
So now you've noticed how much time...

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:43.663
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

01:26:45.374 --> 01:26:47.167
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.753
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!

01:26:51.089 --> 01:26:52.380
You look a bit perkier.

01:26:52.548 --> 01:26:54.883
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.641
Turbulence on the plane?

01:27:02.809 --> 01:27:04.518
No, it's much closer.

01:27:04.685 --> 01:27:06.353
That's Yusuf's driving.

01:27:14.695 --> 01:27:17.155
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

01:27:17.323 --> 01:27:19.407
Rod Green from marketing.

01:27:19.575 --> 01:27:21.201
But that's not true at all, is it?

01:27:23.287 --> 01:27:26.748
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:28.917
I'm the head of your security down here.

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:32.129
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

01:27:32.296 --> 01:27:34.631
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

01:27:34.799 --> 01:27:38.301
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

01:27:41.931 --> 01:27:43.515
Security, huh?

01:27:45.935 --> 01:27:48.103
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

01:27:48.271 --> 01:27:52.899
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

01:27:53.276 --> 01:27:54.943
Subconscious security.

01:27:55.111 --> 01:27:57.237
You're talking about dreams?

01:27:57.405 --> 01:28:00.240
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

01:28:01.284 --> 01:28:02.701
I am here to protect you.

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:18.675
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

01:28:18.843 --> 01:28:22.220
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

01:28:22.388 --> 01:28:25.015
You're not safe here.

01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:27.434
They're coming for you.

01:28:45.786 --> 01:28:47.829
Strange weather, isn't it?

01:28:52.668 --> 01:28:53.793
You feel that?

01:28:55.796 --> 01:28:56.963
What's happening?

01:28:57.131 --> 01:29:00.383
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

01:29:00.551 --> 01:29:03.428
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

01:29:03.596 --> 01:29:06.640
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:15.523
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

01:29:16.192 --> 01:29:18.235
We should probably get out of here.

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:37.087
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

01:29:37.254 --> 01:29:41.257
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

01:29:41.425 --> 01:29:44.594
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

01:29:49.392 --> 01:29:51.643
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

01:29:51.852 --> 01:29:55.897
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

01:29:56.732 --> 01:29:58.024
Yeah, I...

01:29:58.192 --> 01:30:00.694
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

01:30:02.738 --> 01:30:06.074
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

01:30:08.077 --> 01:30:09.452
Mm-hm.

01:30:12.248 --> 01:30:14.082
- You're not real?
- No.

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.627
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

01:30:17.795 --> 01:30:19.879
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:22.966
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

01:30:23.134 --> 01:30:26.386
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:28.513
Yeah.

01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:29.764
Okay.

01:30:30.683 --> 01:30:31.891
Okay.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.730
Can you get me out of here?

01:30:37.648 --> 01:30:40.233
Right away. Follow me.

01:30:54.457 --> 01:30:55.790
Hold on a second.

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.589
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:05.008
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

01:31:05.176 --> 01:31:07.761
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

01:31:09.472 --> 01:31:11.765
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

01:31:23.486 --> 01:31:27.113
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.365
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

01:31:29.533 --> 01:31:33.036
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

01:31:33.204 --> 01:31:34.370
...you may not wake up.

01:31:35.498 --> 01:31:39.793
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:43.797
You remember the training.

01:31:44.965 --> 01:31:46.341
Remember what I said to you.

01:31:47.218 --> 01:31:48.384
Give me the gun.

01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:02.816
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:13.660
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:17.664
What do you remember
from before this dream?

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.667
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:23.461
There was rain.

01:32:24.004 --> 01:32:25.588
Uncle Peter.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.509
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:35.807
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

01:32:36.016 --> 01:32:38.059
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

01:32:38.227 --> 01:32:40.520
It had something to do with, um...

01:32:41.147 --> 01:32:44.023
Something to do with a safe.

01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:46.276
God, why is it so hard to remember?

01:32:46.443 --> 01:32:49.154
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

01:32:49.321 --> 01:32:51.030
Listen, it takes years of practice.

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.616
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

01:32:53.784 --> 01:32:56.536
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

01:32:56.704 --> 01:33:00.290
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

01:33:00.457 --> 01:33:02.083
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

01:33:02.251 --> 01:33:06.004
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

01:33:06.172 --> 01:33:08.882
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

01:33:09.049 --> 01:33:12.844
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

01:33:13.637 --> 01:33:16.764
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

01:33:16.932 --> 01:33:19.767
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

01:33:19.935 --> 01:33:21.269
Five.

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:24.689
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

01:33:24.857 --> 01:33:26.941
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:28.151
Yep.

01:33:28.319 --> 01:33:32.363
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:35.825
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

01:33:35.993 --> 01:33:38.119
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

01:33:38.287 --> 01:33:42.248
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:45.585
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:48.171
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

01:33:48.339 --> 01:33:51.591
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:55.595
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

01:33:56.096 --> 01:33:58.932
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:06.814
They're with me. Go on.

01:34:31.131 --> 01:34:32.173
Mr. Charles.

01:34:32.341 --> 01:34:35.301
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:37.553
They were trying to put you under.

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:40.056
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

01:34:40.224 --> 01:34:42.809
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

01:34:43.394 --> 01:34:45.853
Hey. I see you've changed.

01:34:46.021 --> 01:34:47.647
I'm sorry?

01:34:48.148 --> 01:34:52.026
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

01:34:52.194 --> 01:34:53.486
Oh.

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.780
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

01:34:56.448 --> 01:34:59.367
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

01:34:59.535 --> 01:35:01.411
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

01:35:01.578 --> 01:35:03.538
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

01:35:03.706 --> 01:35:07.041
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

01:35:07.209 --> 01:35:08.251
Shh.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.341
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:18.928
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

01:35:19.096 --> 01:35:20.555
And you saw them torture him?

01:35:28.105 --> 01:35:29.939
The kidnappers are working for you?

01:35:30.899 --> 01:35:32.358
Robert.

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:36.362
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:41.034
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

01:35:41.201 --> 01:35:43.536
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:47.874
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:51.711
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:53.838
That's his last insult.

01:35:54.006 --> 01:35:57.633
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

01:35:57.801 --> 01:36:01.596
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

01:36:07.269 --> 01:36:12.648
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

01:36:14.026 --> 01:36:17.111
But he's wrong.

01:36:17.863 --> 01:36:20.490
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

01:36:20.657 --> 01:36:23.076
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

01:36:23.243 --> 01:36:25.370
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

01:36:25.537 --> 01:36:28.289
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:32.919
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

01:36:35.464 --> 01:36:39.550
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

01:36:40.803 --> 01:36:42.261
All right.

01:36:48.268 --> 01:36:49.519
- He's out.
- Wait.

01:36:49.686 --> 01:36:51.771
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:53.272
We're going into Fischer's.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.109
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

01:36:56.276 --> 01:36:58.611
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.363
That's right.

01:37:00.531 --> 01:37:02.615
Security's gonna run you down hard.

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:05.118
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

01:37:05.661 --> 01:37:08.287
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

01:37:13.502 --> 01:37:14.710
You good?

01:37:17.881 --> 01:37:19.215
Hey. You ready?

01:37:19.383 --> 01:37:22.969
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

01:37:35.524 --> 01:37:36.858
Cobb?

01:37:37.526 --> 01:37:39.986
Cobb? What's down there?

01:37:43.323 --> 01:37:45.950
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

01:37:46.118 --> 01:37:47.994
I mean, what's down there for you?

01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:26.360
Did you see that?

01:40:44.838 --> 01:40:46.672
Eames, this is your dream.

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:49.967
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

01:40:50.135 --> 01:40:51.927
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

01:40:52.095 --> 01:40:54.555
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

01:40:54.723 --> 01:40:57.266
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

01:40:57.434 --> 01:40:58.976
I could do it.

01:40:59.394 --> 01:41:01.854
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:06.192
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.195
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:13.532
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.992
You're not coming in?

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.495
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

01:41:17.663 --> 01:41:20.706
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:23.042
Come on, Fischer!

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:21.767
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:23.477
Move!

01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:26.105
Go!

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:42.329
Sod it.

01:42:53.508 --> 01:42:55.176
I hope you're ready.

01:43:03.935 --> 01:43:05.686
No, it's too soon.

01:43:12.194 --> 01:43:13.402
Cobb, do you hear that?

01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:17.156
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

01:43:17.657 --> 01:43:20.159
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:21.744
So, what do we do?

01:43:21.912 --> 01:43:23.329
We move fast.

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:31.045
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

01:43:32.923 --> 01:43:35.299
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

01:43:36.218 --> 01:43:38.344
- Hey!
- That's him!

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:40.721
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

01:43:40.889 --> 01:43:44.183
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:47.186
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

01:43:58.406 --> 01:44:00.032
It's designed as a labyrinth.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.701
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:04.453
Eames?

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.811
Did Eames add any features?

01:44:28.979 --> 01:44:30.437
I don't think I should tell you.

01:44:30.605 --> 01:44:32.898
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

01:44:33.358 --> 01:44:34.608
He added an air-duct system...

01:44:34.776 --> 01:44:36.527
...that can cut through the maze.
- Good. Explain it to them.

01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:13.772
Paradox.

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:25.719
- What was that?
- The kick.

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:28.222
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:30.099
Yeah, we missed it.

01:46:30.266 --> 01:46:31.475
Man.

01:46:31.643 --> 01:46:35.938
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

01:46:36.106 --> 01:46:37.356
Uh-huh.

01:46:38.108 --> 01:46:40.275
Well, what the hell do we do now?

01:46:40.443 --> 01:46:42.277
We finish the job before the next kick.

01:46:42.445 --> 01:46:44.530
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:10.848
Lfyou'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.

01:47:11.015 --> 01:47:12.850
If you need help, hang up...

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:16.395
How do I drop you without gravity?

01:47:18.898 --> 01:47:21.567
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

01:47:44.966 --> 01:47:46.633
You okay?

01:47:51.097 --> 01:47:54.975
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

01:47:55.143 --> 01:47:56.685
Go, go, go!

01:47:58.855 --> 01:48:00.022
There's something wrong.

01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:02.524
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:05.986
Just buy us more time, all right?

01:48:06.154 --> 01:48:07.988
- Come on!
- On my way.

01:48:08.156 --> 01:48:09.865
Come on! Move!

01:49:34.033 --> 01:49:35.576
All right.

01:49:47.755 --> 01:49:50.549
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:54.219
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.638
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

01:49:58.266 --> 01:50:01.602
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

01:50:01.769 --> 01:50:05.147
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:33.175
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

01:50:33.343 --> 01:50:35.177
There's an entire army headed your way.

01:51:01.996 --> 01:51:03.372
I'm in.

01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:09.795
There he is.

01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:55.090
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

01:51:56.259 --> 01:51:58.844
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

01:52:04.559 --> 01:52:05.726
Cobb.

01:52:06.352 --> 01:52:08.895
No, she is not real.

01:52:09.522 --> 01:52:10.731
How do you know that?

01:52:10.898 --> 01:52:14.526
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:20.073
Hello.

01:52:24.746 --> 01:52:27.956
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

01:53:11.876 --> 01:53:14.753
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

01:53:17.006 --> 01:53:19.049
I couldn't shoot her.

01:53:19.717 --> 01:53:23.095
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

01:53:23.262 --> 01:53:24.304
It's all over.

01:53:26.057 --> 01:53:27.682
So that's it, then? We failed?

01:53:28.309 --> 01:53:30.477
We're done. I'm sorry.

01:53:34.357 --> 01:53:36.983
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

01:53:37.693 --> 01:53:41.613
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.824
Let's set the charges.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.160
No, there's still another way.

01:53:48.454 --> 01:53:51.873
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

01:53:52.041 --> 01:53:54.876
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

01:53:56.003 --> 01:53:57.129
And we will find him.

01:53:57.296 --> 01:54:01.216
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

01:54:01.384 --> 01:54:04.302
We can give him his own kick
down below.

01:54:05.304 --> 01:54:07.013
Look, you get him in there.

01:54:07.181 --> 01:54:10.058
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

01:54:10.226 --> 01:54:13.019
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:18.984
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:21.278
Saito will never make it, will he?

01:54:23.322 --> 01:54:25.782
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:28.869
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

01:54:29.036 --> 01:54:32.289
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:38.712
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.088
Mal's gonna be down there.

01:54:40.256 --> 01:54:42.674
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:46.761
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

01:54:46.929 --> 01:54:49.097
She wants me back down there with her.

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:16.875
All right?

01:55:24.133 --> 01:55:26.801
- This is your world?
- It was.

01:55:27.595 --> 01:55:29.554
And this is where she'll be.

01:55:30.264 --> 01:55:31.306
Come on.

01:56:18.312 --> 01:56:20.772
Saito. Saito.

01:56:21.232 --> 01:56:25.193
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

01:56:25.361 --> 01:56:28.780
No room for tourists on these jobs.

01:56:31.450 --> 01:56:32.617
Don't be silly.

01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:07.152
You built all this? This is incredible.

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:09.654
We built for years.

01:57:10.698 --> 01:57:12.699
Then we started in on the memories.

01:57:19.749 --> 01:57:21.166
This way.

01:58:02.833 --> 01:58:04.918
This was our neighborhood.

01:58:05.086 --> 01:58:07.420
Places from our past.

01:58:07.588 --> 01:58:09.380
That was our first apartment.

01:58:09.548 --> 01:58:11.758
Then we moved to that building
right there.

01:58:11.926 --> 01:58:14.469
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

01:58:14.637 --> 01:58:17.430
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

01:58:17.598 --> 01:58:19.891
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:21.643
What is that?

01:58:23.187 --> 01:58:24.938
That's the house Mal grew up in.

01:58:25.106 --> 01:58:27.565
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.900
Come on.

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:32.403
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

01:58:32.571 --> 01:58:35.532
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:18.116
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

01:59:18.534 --> 01:59:20.952
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.537
What?

01:59:23.539 --> 01:59:24.622
I'm gonna improvise.

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:29.460
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

01:59:42.558 --> 01:59:46.436
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

01:59:47.271 --> 01:59:48.813
Highly contagious.

01:59:48.981 --> 01:59:52.317
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

01:59:53.402 --> 01:59:55.361
It can grow to define...

01:59:56.405 --> 01:59:57.989
...or destroy you.

02:00:04.496 --> 02:00:06.831
"Your world is not real."

02:00:07.124 --> 02:00:10.877
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

02:00:12.129 --> 02:00:16.633
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.593
Do you think he is?

02:00:20.387 --> 02:00:23.306
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

02:00:24.433 --> 02:00:25.934
I know what's real, Mal.

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.313
No creeping doubts?

02:00:31.023 --> 02:00:33.650
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

02:00:33.943 --> 02:00:35.276
Chased around the globe...

02:00:35.444 --> 02:00:38.112
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.907
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

02:00:42.534 --> 02:00:44.035
Admit it.

02:00:45.329 --> 02:00:48.164
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

02:00:48.332 --> 02:00:49.874
So choose.

02:00:50.042 --> 02:00:53.378
Choose to be here. Choose me.

02:01:20.155 --> 02:01:21.406
You know what I have to do.

02:01:21.573 --> 02:01:24.242
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

02:01:25.577 --> 02:01:27.120
Because you left us.

02:01:27.288 --> 02:01:29.080
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:31.291
You're confused.

02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:34.460
Our children are here.

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:38.506
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

02:01:38.674 --> 02:01:41.759
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

02:01:55.399 --> 02:01:57.400
Up above?

02:01:58.277 --> 02:02:01.946
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:03.823
Watch.

02:02:04.325 --> 02:02:06.034
James? Phillipa?

02:02:06.201 --> 02:02:08.619
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

02:02:08.787 --> 02:02:11.289
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:13.333
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

02:02:13.751 --> 02:02:16.044
What if I'm what's real?

02:02:17.254 --> 02:02:19.464
You keep telling yourself what you know.

02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:23.301
But what do you believe?

02:02:24.261 --> 02:02:25.470
What do you feel?

02:02:27.639 --> 02:02:29.057
Guilt.

02:02:30.267 --> 02:02:32.477
I feel guilt, Mal.

02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:36.981
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:41.402
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:44.113
...reminding me of the truth.

02:02:44.615 --> 02:02:45.907
What truth?

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:53.581
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:00.088
You planted the idea in my mind?

02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:03.091
What is she talking about?

02:03:04.009 --> 02:03:09.263
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

02:03:10.307 --> 02:03:13.267
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:15.520
We were lost in here.

02:03:16.438 --> 02:03:21.067
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

02:03:24.279 --> 02:03:29.951
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

02:03:30.702 --> 02:03:34.872
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

02:03:35.833 --> 02:03:37.959
And she couldn't break free.

02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:43.381
So I decided to search for it.

02:03:43.966 --> 02:03:48.845
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

02:03:49.012 --> 02:03:50.888
And I broke in...

02:03:51.473 --> 02:03:53.641
...and I planted an idea.

02:03:54.393 --> 02:03:58.146
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:05.736
That her world wasn't real.

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:21.752
That death was the only escape.

02:04:29.178 --> 02:04:30.928
You're waiting for a train.

02:04:33.265 --> 02:04:35.975
A train that'll take you far away.

02:04:37.144 --> 02:04:40.146
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:43.274
...but you can't know for sure.

02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:45.985
Yet it doesn't matter.

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:50.615
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

02:04:54.953 --> 02:04:58.998
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

02:04:59.166 --> 02:05:01.584
...that even after she woke...

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:06.964
That even after
you came back to reality...

02:05:09.885 --> 02:05:12.845
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

02:05:15.641 --> 02:05:18.017
That death was the only escape.

02:05:18.185 --> 02:05:20.853
Mal, no! Jesus!

02:05:21.021 --> 02:05:24.732
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:26.317
You betrayed me.

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:30.821
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

02:05:30.989 --> 02:05:34.033
We can still be together, right here...

02:05:34.201 --> 02:05:36.661
...in the world we built together.

02:06:57.492 --> 02:06:59.827
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

02:07:00.704 --> 02:07:01.996
You can't have him.

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:06.459
- Lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

02:07:10.922 --> 02:07:12.757
Fischer is on the porch.

02:07:13.342 --> 02:07:15.926
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

02:07:16.094 --> 02:07:18.763
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

02:07:34.404 --> 02:07:37.490
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

02:07:37.658 --> 02:07:41.327
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

02:07:43.914 --> 02:07:46.624
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:50.294
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:55.383
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:58.969
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

02:07:59.137 --> 02:08:00.471
No.

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.057
I wish.

02:08:04.643 --> 02:08:07.144
I wish more than anything, but...

02:08:08.271 --> 02:08:10.981
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:13.693
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:15.820
- You all right?
- Yeah.

02:08:15.987 --> 02:08:17.822
Look at you.

02:08:19.074 --> 02:08:23.994
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

02:08:24.454 --> 02:08:27.081
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

02:08:27.916 --> 02:08:30.334
...l'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

02:08:30.502 --> 02:08:32.169
Does this feel real?

02:08:34.548 --> 02:08:37.174
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

02:08:45.767 --> 02:08:47.476
No, no, no!

02:08:48.437 --> 02:08:50.855
In there, now. Go, go, go.

02:09:35.692 --> 02:09:37.568
I was dis...

02:09:39.279 --> 02:09:41.614
I was dis... Disa...

02:09:42.491 --> 02:09:45.034
- I know, Dad.
- Dis...

02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:53.125
I know you were disappointed...

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.294
...I couldn't be you.

02:09:55.712 --> 02:09:57.213
No.

02:09:57.714 --> 02:09:58.923
No, no, no.

02:09:59.966 --> 02:10:01.967
I was disappointed...

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.638
...that you tried.

02:10:28.912 --> 02:10:30.579
What?

02:10:40.006 --> 02:10:41.131
Come on, come on.

02:11:11.371 --> 02:11:12.872
Dad?

02:11:51.202 --> 02:11:54.288
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

02:12:07.135 --> 02:12:10.554
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

02:12:10.722 --> 02:12:12.389
I will!

02:12:52.555 --> 02:12:55.307
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

02:12:55.475 --> 02:12:56.600
Yes.

02:12:56.768 --> 02:12:59.812
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

02:13:02.524 --> 02:13:04.024
But we did.

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:08.320
We did. You don't remember?

02:13:12.993 --> 02:13:15.828
I miss you more than I can bear...

02:13:18.206 --> 02:13:20.207
...but we had our time together.

02:13:21.543 --> 02:13:23.627
And I have to let you go.

02:13:25.714 --> 02:13:27.506
I have to let you go.

02:14:18.767 --> 02:14:20.059
I'm sorry, Robert.

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:51.381
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

02:14:52.467 --> 02:14:54.510
...not just to live for him.

02:14:56.096 --> 02:14:58.639
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

02:15:08.399 --> 02:15:09.650
What happened?

02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:11.819
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

02:15:11.986 --> 02:15:13.237
No, to find Saito.

02:15:15.532 --> 02:15:17.282
He'll be lost.

02:15:19.828 --> 02:15:21.662
No, he'll be all right.

02:15:37.679 --> 02:15:39.638
Have you come to kill me?

02:15:43.935 --> 02:15:46.395
I'm waiting for someone.

02:15:50.859 --> 02:15:53.610
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

02:15:56.364 --> 02:15:57.781
Cobb?

02:15:59.701 --> 02:16:01.451
Impossible.

02:16:01.995 --> 02:16:04.621
We were young men together.

02:16:06.207 --> 02:16:08.542
I'm an old man.

02:16:09.794 --> 02:16:11.837
Filled with regret.

02:16:14.966 --> 02:16:17.676
Waiting to die alone.

02:16:20.847 --> 02:16:23.015
I've come back for you.

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:30.147
To remind you of something.

02:16:33.442 --> 02:16:35.818
Something you once knew.

02:16:38.656 --> 02:16:40.907
That this world is not real.

02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:50.334
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:53.921
To take a leap of faith, yes.

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:01.344
Come back...

02:17:03.889 --> 02:17:07.267
...so we can be
young men together again.

02:17:11.022 --> 02:17:13.022
Come back with me.

02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:17.527
Come back.

02:17:27.288 --> 02:17:28.996
Hot towel, sir?

02:17:29.624 --> 02:17:32.501
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

02:17:32.670 --> 02:17:34.959
Do you need immigration forms?

02:17:37.049 --> 02:17:38.379
Thank you.

02:17:38.879 --> 02:17:40.500
Hot towel, sir?

02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:44.510
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

02:18:55.879 --> 02:18:56.959
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

02:18:58.100 --> 02:18:59.709
Thank you, sir.

02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.129
Welcome.

02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:47.000
This way.

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:11.660
James? Phillipa?

02:20:15.370 --> 02:20:16.665
Look who's here.

02:20:22.255 --> 02:20:23.350
Hey.

02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:27.130
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:29.550
- Daddy!
- How are you?

02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:32.260
Look what I've been building!

02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:36.140
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

02:20:36.310 --> 02:20:39.190
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

02:20:39.355 --> 02:20:41.900
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
