01:19.320 --> 01:21.368
Sure I won't get in trouble, Bill?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.567
Don't be a wuss.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.286
I'd come with you if I weren't dying.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.895
You're not dying!

01:31.600 --> 01:34.724
You didn't see the vomit
coming out of my nose this morning?

01:34.960 --> 01:37.403
That's disgusting.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.644
Okay. Go get the wax.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.931
In the cellar?

01:44.200 --> 01:46.965
You want it to float, don't you?

01:47.360 --> 01:48.930
Fine.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.646
<i>Georgie.</i>

02:50.080 --> 02:51.286
Hurry up.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.446
Okay. I'm brave.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.490
Where's the wax?

03:25.040 --> 03:26.121
There's the wax.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.281
Yes.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.761
What was that? What's that?

03:51.440 --> 03:52.441
Oh, jeez.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.811
All right.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.010
There you go.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.163
She's all ready, Captain.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.401
She?

04:18.600 --> 04:21.171
You always call boats "she."

04:22.560 --> 04:23.561
"She."

04:23.920 --> 04:25.081
Thanks, Billy.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.801
See you later. Bye.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.810
Be careful.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.881
No!

05:55.120 --> 05:56.121
No!

05:58.120 --> 05:59.485
Oh, Bill's gonna kill me.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.722
Hiya, Georgie.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.451
What a nice boat.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.561
Do you want it back?

06:18.480 --> 06:20.050
Um, yes, please.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.529
You look like a nice boy.
I bet you have a lot of friends.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.685
Three, but my brother's my best best.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.126
Where is he?

06:29.440 --> 06:31.488
In bed. Sick.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.162
I bet I can cheer him up.
I'll give him a balloon.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.405
Do you want a balloon too, Georgie?

06:40.760 --> 06:43.843
I'm not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

06:44.160 --> 06:48.563
Oh... Well, I'm Pennywise the Dancing Clown.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.920
"Pennywise?" "Yes." "Meet Georgie.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.362
"Georgie, meet Pennywise."

06:58.480 --> 07:01.131
Now we aren't strangers, are we?

07:21.320 --> 07:23.129
What are you doing in the sewer?

07:23.320 --> 07:25.846
A storm blew me away.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.330
Blew the whole circus away.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.531
Can you smell the circus, Georgie?

07:35.920 --> 07:39.766
There's peanuts, cotton candy,

07:40.360 --> 07:41.930
<i>hot dogs,</i>

07:42.120 --> 07:43.804
and...

07:44.760 --> 07:45.761
Popcorn?

07:45.960 --> 07:48.122
Popcorn! Is that your favorite?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.085
- Uh-huh.
- Mine, too.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.045
Because they pop. Pop, pop, pop.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.601
Pop, pop, pop.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.723
Pop.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.130
I should get going now.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.361
Oh.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.530
Without your boat?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.486
<i>You don't wanna lose it, Georgie.</i>

08:17.960 --> 08:19.849
Bill's gonna kill you.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.885
Here.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.211
Take it.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.962
Take it, Georgie.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.726
Help!

09:04.800 --> 09:05.961
Billy!

10:09.320 --> 10:10.685
<i>Pull it, Mike.</i>

10:13.840 --> 10:15.524
<i>Go on now, pull it.</i>

10:26.600 --> 10:27.647
Here, reload it.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.764
You need to start taking
more responsibility around here, Mike.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.451
Your dad was younger than you when he took...

10:32.640 --> 10:34.847
I'm not my dad, okay?

10:35.560 --> 10:36.607
Yeah.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.170
Look at me, son.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.041
Look at me!

10:44.640 --> 10:47.246
There are two places you
can be in this world.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.364
You can be out here like us
or you can be in there,

10:50.800 --> 10:52.325
like them.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.284
You waste time hemming and hawing,

10:54.480 --> 10:57.882
and someone else
is gonna make that choice for you.

10:58.840 --> 11:02.765
Except you won't know it until
you feel that bolt between your eyes.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.161
So, there's this church full of Jews, right?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.323
And Stan has to take this super Jewy test.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.965
But how's it work?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.931
They slice the tip of his dick off.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.451
But then Stan will have nothing left!

11:21.640 --> 11:23.324
- That's true.
- Wait up, you guys!

11:23.520 --> 11:26.000
Hey, Stan, what happens
at the Bar Mitzvah, anyways?

11:26.240 --> 11:29.562
Ed says they slice the tip of your dick off.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.002
Yeah, and I think the rabbi's
gonna pull down your pants,

11:32.200 --> 11:33.565
turn to the crowd and say,
"Where's the beef?"

11:35.040 --> 11:37.441
At the Bar Mitzvah, I read from the Torah,

11:37.640 --> 11:40.007
and then I make a speech
and suddenly, I become a man.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.770
I could think of funner ways to become a man.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.281
- <i>"More fun" you mean.</i>
- Oh, shit.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.562
Think they'll sign my yearbook?

11:52.760 --> 11:56.491
"Dear Richie, sorry for taking a hot,
steaming dump in your backpack last March.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.485
<i>"Have a good summer."</i>

12:08.920 --> 12:10.524
<i>Are you in there by yourself, Beaver-ly?</i>

12:10.720 --> 12:13.246
Or do you have half the guys in the school
with you, huh, slut?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.766
I know you're in there, little shit.
I can smell you.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.809
<i>No wonder you don't have any friends.</i>

12:19.000 --> 12:22.925
Which is it, Gretta?
Am I a slut or a little shit?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.481
Make up your mind.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.847
You're trash.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.561
We just wanted to remind you.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.721
<i>Such a loser.</i>

12:34.560 --> 12:36.563
<i>Well, at least now you'll smell better.</i>

12:36.760 --> 12:37.761
<i>Gross.</i>

12:38.360 --> 12:39.930
Let's go, girls.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.770
<i>Have a nice summer, Beaver-ly.</i>

12:41.960 --> 12:43.849
<i>Pathetic.</i>

12:52.120 --> 12:53.281
Best feeling ever.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.441
Yeah?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.204
Try tickling your pickle for the first time.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.681
Hey, what do you guys wanna do tomorrow?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.041
I start my training.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.884
- Wait, what training?
- <i>Street Fighter.</i>

13:01.040 --> 13:03.520
Is that how you wanna spend your summer?
Inside of an arcade?

13:04.040 --> 13:05.451
Beats spending it inside of your mother.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.365
- Oh!
- What if we go to the quarry?

13:08.320 --> 13:11.051
Guys, we have the Barrens.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.287
Right.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.721
Betty Ripsom's mom.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.846
<i>Is she really expecting to
see her come out of that school?</i>

13:20.680 --> 13:21.727
I don't know.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.042
As if Betty Ripsom's been hiding
in Home Ec. for the last few weeks.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.526
You think they'll actually find her?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.681
Sure.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.326
In a ditch. All decomposed,
covered in worms and maggots.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.567
Smelling like Eddie's mom's underwear.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.085
Shut up! That's freaking disgusting.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.324
She's not dead. She's missing.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.764
Sorry, Bill. She's missing.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.930
You know the Barrens aren't that bad.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.686
Who doesn't love splashing around
in shitty water?

13:48.680 --> 13:50.045
Nice Frisbee, flamer.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.924
Give it back!

13:52.160 --> 13:53.161
Fucking losers!

13:57.440 --> 13:58.441
Loser.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.446
You suck, Bowers.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.921
Shut up, Bill.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.085
You say something, Billy?

14:12.760 --> 14:15.605
You got a free ride this year
'cause of your little brother.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.290
Ride's over, Denbrough.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.571
This summer's gonna be a hurt train
for you and your faggot friends.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.450
I wish he'd go missing.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.165
He's probably the one doing it.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.801
You gonna let me go by?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.809
Or is there a secret password or something?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.081
Oh.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.370
- Um, sorry.
- Sorry isn't...

15:06.360 --> 15:07.521
A password.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.370
Henry and his goons are over
by the west entrance.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.721
So you should be fine.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.961
Oh, I wasn't...

15:21.160 --> 15:23.003
Everyone knows he's looking for you.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.730
What you listening to?

15:32.960 --> 15:34.166
New Kids on the Block.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.691
I don't even like them. I was just...

15:35.840 --> 15:39.162
Wait. You're the new kid, right?
Now I get it.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.851
There's nothing to get.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.083
I'm just messing with you.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.687
I'm Beverly Marsh.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.248
Yeah. I know that
'cause we're in the same class.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.528
Social Studies. And you were...

15:52.560 --> 15:56.167
I'm Ben. But pretty much
everybody just calls me...

15:56.360 --> 15:57.725
The new kid.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.089
Well, Ben, there are worse things
to be called.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.925
Let me sign this.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.248
Stay cool, Ben from sosh class.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.771
Uh, yeah.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.726
You too, Beverly.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.008
Hang tough, new kid on the block.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.765
"Please Don't Go, Girl."

16:38.080 --> 16:42.005
That's the name of another
New Kids on the Block song.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.763
"He thrusts his fists against the posts...

16:55.920 --> 16:58.491
"He thrusts his fists against...

17:00.720 --> 17:03.121
Shit!

17:05.119 --> 17:06.121
"Post."

17:14.880 --> 17:16.883
Need some help? I...

17:17.319 --> 17:19.003
I thought we agreed.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.050
- Before you say anything...
- Bill.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.681
Just let me show you something first.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.525
The Barrens.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.043
It's the only place that
Georgie could have ended up.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.685
He's gone, Bill.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.650
But if the storm swept Georgie in,
we should have gone...

17:56.880 --> 17:59.884
He's gone! He's dead!

18:00.920 --> 18:04.686
<i>He's dead! There is nothing we can do!
Nothing!</i>

18:08.240 --> 18:11.449
Now take this down
before your mother sees it.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.001
Next time you wanna take something
from my office...

18:22.160 --> 18:23.207
Ask.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.523
I guess you get your tunnels back.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.681
Get in!

19:01.880 --> 19:02.881
<i>Creep!</i>

19:12.120 --> 19:13.201
Oh, Jesus.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.241
<i>Mike!</i>

19:50.160 --> 19:51.161
<i>Hurry, son!</i>

19:51.400 --> 19:53.004
<i>Help! It burns!</i>

19:55.760 --> 19:56.761
<i>Mike!</i>

20:26.600 --> 20:28.489
Stay the fuck outta my town!

20:35.800 --> 20:36.801
Mike?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.481
<i>Are you okay?</i>

20:56.680 --> 20:58.523
You're not studying, Stanley.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.325
How's it going to look?

21:01.520 --> 21:04.683
The rabbi's son
can't finish his own Torah reading.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.165
Take the book to my office.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.283
<i>Obviously you're not using it.</i>

23:04.960 --> 23:06.769
<i>Take everything
but the Delicious Deals, guys.</i>

23:06.960 --> 23:08.041
<i>My mom loves them.</i>

23:08.280 --> 23:11.967
Hey! First you said the Barrens,
and now you're saying the sewer.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.640
I mean, what if we get caught?

23:14.880 --> 23:17.451
We won't, Eds. The sewers are public works.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.926
We're the public, aren't we?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.807
Hey, Eddie, these your birth control pills?

23:22.480 --> 23:25.563
Yeah, and I'm saving it for your sister.
This is private stuff.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.441
<i>Hello, and welcome to</i>
<i>the</i> Derry Children's Hour.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.761
Eddie Bear, where you boys off to
in such a rush?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.448
Um...

23:36.760 --> 23:39.969
Just my backyard, Mrs. K.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.090
I got a new...

23:43.640 --> 23:48.362
- A new croquet set.
- Jeez, spit it out, Bill!

23:48.560 --> 23:49.607
Okay.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.681
Oh, and sweetie, don't go
rolling around on the grass.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.610
Especially if it's just been cut.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.243
You know how bad your allergies can get.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.805
Yes, Mom. Let's go.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.167
<i>Aren't you forgetting something?</i>

24:00.360 --> 24:03.409
<i>Water is all around us. It's even above us.</i>

24:08.000 --> 24:09.240
<i>Don't believe me?</i>

24:09.440 --> 24:10.885
<i>Then try it yourself at home.</i>

24:11.240 --> 24:13.004
<i>Whenever you're outside...</i>

24:14.120 --> 24:15.326
Do you want one from me too, Mrs. K?

24:15.520 --> 24:16.931
- I was kidding.
- No, no, no.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.761
Sorry, Mommy.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.490
"Your hair is winter fire, January embers...

24:45.320 --> 24:46.447
"My heart burns there too."

24:46.640 --> 24:47.641
<i>Slow down!</i>

24:47.880 --> 24:49.610
<i>Hi-ho, Silver!</i>

24:49.840 --> 24:50.841
Away!

24:51.040 --> 24:53.247
Your old lady bike's too fast for us!

24:54.160 --> 24:55.207
Found it.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.084
Isn't it summer vacation?

24:57.280 --> 25:00.125
I would think you'd be ready
to take a break from the books.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.401
I like it in here.

25:02.560 --> 25:05.325
A boy should be spending his summer
outside with friends.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.886
Don't you have any friends?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.484
Can I have the book now?

28:13.040 --> 28:14.201
<i>Egg boy.</i>

28:18.000 --> 28:19.081
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

28:39.720 --> 28:41.450
Where are you off to, tits?

28:44.360 --> 28:45.361
Gotcha.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.611
<i>Wait.</i>

28:47.760 --> 28:48.966
- Fucking hold him.
- Leave me alone!

28:49.160 --> 28:50.161
- Smack him.
- Don't let tubby get away.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.321
Help!

28:52.400 --> 28:54.004
Get him!

28:54.720 --> 28:57.166
- Hold him, Hockstetter.
- Get him, Belch.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.281
Stop!

29:00.560 --> 29:03.131
- Just leave me alone.
- Look at all this blubber!

29:04.520 --> 29:07.285
Let me light his hair, like Michael Jackson.

29:07.920 --> 29:08.921
Just hold him.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.208
Get off me! Get off me!

29:19.680 --> 29:20.681
Help!

29:22.800 --> 29:23.961
Help!

29:28.680 --> 29:29.841
Okay, new kid.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.891
This is what us locals
call the Kissing Bridge.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.211
It's famous for two things. Sucking face,

29:37.040 --> 29:38.087
and carving names.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.611
Henry, please.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.281
Whoa, whoa! Henry!

29:47.440 --> 29:48.521
Shut up!

29:49.280 --> 29:51.851
I'm gonna carve my whole name
onto this cottage cheese!

29:56.560 --> 29:58.688
I'm gonna cut your fucking tits off.
I swear to God!

29:59.120 --> 30:00.201
Get him!

30:00.400 --> 30:01.401
<i>Come on!</i>

30:05.160 --> 30:06.241
<i>Get him!</i>

30:06.680 --> 30:07.681
You can't run!

30:09.000 --> 30:10.843
- Oh, no!
- <i>We need to find Fatty!</i>

30:17.920 --> 30:20.571
My knife. My old man will kill me!

30:23.920 --> 30:25.843
- You two, get him!
- Come on!

30:28.200 --> 30:29.691
Move your fucking ass!

30:31.080 --> 30:33.560
<i>He's going that way! Come on!</i>

30:36.040 --> 30:37.246
<i>He's down there.</i>

31:09.760 --> 31:11.410
I don't know. I guess.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.371
That's poison ivy. And that's poison ivy.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.806
And that's poison ivy.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.684
Where? Where's the poison ivy?

31:20.880 --> 31:24.771
Nowhere. Not every fucking plant
is poison ivy, Stanley.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.049
Okay, I'm starting to get itchy now

31:27.280 --> 31:28.441
and I'm pretty sure
this is not good for my...

31:28.600 --> 31:31.206
Do you use the same bathroom as your mother?

31:31.400 --> 31:34.131
- Sometimes, yeah.
- Then you probably have crabs.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.321
<i>That's so not funny.</i>

31:40.560 --> 31:41.687
Aren't you guys coming in?

31:42.680 --> 31:44.250
Uh-uh. It's greywater.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.601
What the hell's greywater?

31:45.840 --> 31:48.605
It's basically piss and shit.
So I'm just telling you,

31:48.840 --> 31:53.289
<i>you guys are splashing around
in millions of gallons of Derry pee. So...</i>

31:53.480 --> 31:54.527
Are you serious? What are you...

31:54.760 --> 31:56.728
Doesn't smell like caca to me, <i>señor.</i>

31:56.920 --> 31:58.729
Okay, I can smell that from here.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.162
It's probably just your breath
wafting back into your face.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.682
Have you ever heard of a staph infection?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.041
Oh, I'll show you a staff infection.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.765
<i>This is so unsanitary. You're literally...</i>

32:06.960 --> 32:09.042
<i>This is literally like swimming
inside of a toilet bowl right now.</i>

32:09.280 --> 32:10.691
<i>Have you ever heard of Listeria?</i>

32:12.480 --> 32:13.527
<i>Are you retarded?</i>

32:13.720 --> 32:15.484
You're the reason why
we're in this position right now.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.920
Guys!

32:19.200 --> 32:21.248
Shit. Don't tell me that's...

32:21.840 --> 32:22.841
<i>No.</i>

32:23.520 --> 32:25.443
Georgie wore galoshes.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.360
Whose sneaker is it?

32:31.360 --> 32:32.441
It's Betty Ripsom's.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.080
Oh, shit.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.566
<i>Oh, God. Oh, fuck!</i>

32:35.800 --> 32:36.847
I don't like this.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.849
How do you think Betty feels?

32:39.360 --> 32:42.205
Running around these tunnels
with only one frickin' shoe?

32:46.360 --> 32:47.851
What if she's still here?

32:53.120 --> 32:54.360
Eddie, come on!

32:54.560 --> 32:57.245
My mom will have an aneurysm, if she
finds out that we're playing down here.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.401
I'm serious.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.127
Bill?

33:03.240 --> 33:07.325
If... If I was Betty Ripsom,
I would want us to find me.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.405
Georgie too.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.366
What if I don't want to find them?

33:15.200 --> 33:19.046
I mean, no offense, Bill,
but I don't want to end up like...

33:22.240 --> 33:23.605
I don't want to go missing either.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.527
- He has a point.
- You too?

33:26.720 --> 33:28.085
It's summer.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.725
We're supposed to be having fun.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.325
<i>This isn't fun.</i>

33:33.080 --> 33:34.320
This is scary and disgusting.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.083
Holy shit! What happened to you?

34:25.800 --> 34:28.042
I hear ya, tits.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.882
Don't think you can stay down here
all damn day now.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.641
You found us, Patrick.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.764
<i>You found us, Patrick.</i>

35:08.960 --> 35:10.291
<i>Patrick.</i>

35:26.680 --> 35:27.681
Fuck!

35:59.200 --> 36:00.804
I think it's great that
we're helping the new kid,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.365
but also we need to think of our own safety.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.130
I mean, he's bleeding all over
and you guys know

36:04.320 --> 36:06.402
that there's an AIDS epidemic happening
right now as we speak, right?

36:06.640 --> 36:10.122
My mom's friend in New York City got it
by touching a dirty pole on the subway.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.324
And a drop of AIDS blood got into
his system through a hangnail. A hangnail!

36:13.560 --> 36:16.370
And you can amputate legs and arms.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.086
But how do you amputate a waist?

36:19.280 --> 36:21.647
You guys do know that alleys are known
for dirty needles that have AIDS, right?

36:21.800 --> 36:22.801
You guys do know that?

36:23.440 --> 36:24.646
- Hey...
- Ah, we're screwed.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.570
Richie, wait here. Come on.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.089
Glad I got to meet you before you died.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.441
Okay.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.520
<i>Can we afford all that?</i>

36:45.800 --> 36:46.801
It's all we got.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.127
You kidding me?

36:50.640 --> 36:52.802
Wait, you have an account here, don't you?

36:53.280 --> 36:55.965
If my mom finds out
I bought all this stuff for myself...

36:56.120 --> 36:59.044
I'm spending the whole rest of the weekend
in the emergency room getting X-rayed.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.163
- <i>See you later, Dad.</i>
- <i>See you, Gretta.</i>

37:21.880 --> 37:23.086
You okay?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.843
I'm fine. What's wrong with you?

37:27.280 --> 37:28.327
None of your business.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.722
There's a kid outside.
Looked like someone killed him.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.969
We need some supplies,

37:35.160 --> 37:37.845
but we don't have enough money.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.890
I like your glasses, Mr. Keene.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.807
You look just like Clark Kent.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.331
Oh.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.011
I don't know about that.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.480
Can I try them?

37:54.360 --> 37:56.328
Mmm. Sure.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.050
What do you think?

38:05.080 --> 38:07.242
Well, how about that?

38:07.680 --> 38:09.922
You look just like Lois Lane.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.045
Really?

38:13.440 --> 38:14.646
Mmm.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.331
Well, here you go.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.166
Shoot, I'm so sorry.

38:22.840 --> 38:23.921
It's okay.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.207
<i>Just suck the wound.</i>

38:38.400 --> 38:40.289
- <i>I need to focus right now.</i>
- <i>You need to focus?</i>

38:40.520 --> 38:41.601
Yeah, can you go get me something?

38:41.880 --> 38:43.883
- Jesus! What do you need?
- Go get my bifocals.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.207
I hid 'em in my second fanny pack.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.811
<i>Why do you have two fanny packs?</i>

38:47.000 --> 38:48.491
<i>I need to focus right now
and it's a long story.</i>

38:48.720 --> 38:49.721
<i>I don't want to get into it.</i>

39:02.160 --> 39:04.208
Um, thanks.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.447
Even-steven.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.961
<i>Oh, God, he's bleeding. Oh, my God!</i>

39:08.240 --> 39:09.241
Ben from sosh?

39:09.400 --> 39:11.767
You have to suck the wound
before you apply the Band-Aids.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.769
- This is 101.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.928
Are you okay? That looks like it hurts.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.128
Oh. No, I'm good. I just fell.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.651
Yeah, right into Henry Bowers.

39:19.880 --> 39:21.325
Shut it, Richie.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.721
Why? It's the truth.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.802
You sure they got the right stuff
to fix you up?

39:31.240 --> 39:33.811
You know, we'll take care of him.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.286
Uh, thanks again, Beverly.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.484
Sure. Maybe I'll see you around.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.444
Yeah, we were thinking about
going to the quarry tomorrow,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.370
if you wanna

39:44.760 --> 39:45.761
<i>come.</i>

39:46.480 --> 39:48.687
Good to know. Thanks.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.409
Nice going bringing up Bowers
in front of her.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.601
Yeah, dude, you heard what she did.

39:56.840 --> 39:57.887
What'd she do?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.167
More like "Who'd she do?"

39:59.400 --> 40:01.482
From what I hear,
the list is longer than my wang.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.325
That's not saying much.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.006
They're just rumors.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.403
Anyway, Bill had her back in third grade.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.801
<i>They kissed in the school play.</i>

40:11.000 --> 40:13.401
<i>The reviews said you can't fake
that sort of passion.</i>

40:13.640 --> 40:16.007
Now, pip-pip and tally-ho, my good fellows,

40:16.600 --> 40:18.523
I do believe this chap requires
our utmost attention.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.250
Get in there, Dr. K. Come on, fix him up.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.323
Why don't you shut the fuck up,
Einstein, because I know what I'm doing

40:22.520 --> 40:24.011
and I don't want you doing
the British guy with me right now.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.764
Suck the wound. Get in there.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.849
<i>Toilet and bath water travel down</i>

40:28.000 --> 40:30.162
<i>the drains and into the sewer.</i>

40:30.440 --> 40:33.922
<i>The sewer is a fun place to play
with all of your friends.</i>

40:34.160 --> 40:38.609
<i>Just follow the water into the drains
and down into the sewers you go.</i>

40:38.800 --> 40:43.363
<i>When you're with your friends in the
sewers, you can be as silly as a clown!</i>

40:43.520 --> 40:45.762
<i>That's right, it's the word of the day.</i>

40:49.120 --> 40:50.121
Hi, Daddy.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.687
Hey, Bevvie.

40:52.360 --> 40:53.487
Whatcha got there?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.206
Just some things.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.960
Like what?

41:20.720 --> 41:23.007
Tell me you're still my little girl.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.886
Yes, Daddy.

41:27.800 --> 41:28.927
Good.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.720
<i>A deep fly ball to the left. His last at bat.</i>

41:32.000 --> 41:33.570
<i>He scratched the foul pole.</i>

41:34.240 --> 41:37.403
<i>Wade Boggs, of course,
leads the league in hitting so far.</i>

41:51.920 --> 41:55.686
This is what you did. This is what you...

41:55.960 --> 41:57.166
This is...

42:30.640 --> 42:31.641
<i>Lay it out.</i>

42:37.760 --> 42:38.761
Oh, my God.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.971
- So easy.
- Poor tree.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.531
So easy!

42:43.320 --> 42:44.970
Oh, my God, that was terrible. I win.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.281
- You won?
- Yeah.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.483
- Did you see my loogie?
- That went the farthest!

42:48.680 --> 42:50.205
- It's by distance.
- Mass. It's always been mass.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.686
What is mass?

42:51.920 --> 42:53.160
Who cares how far it goes?

42:53.360 --> 42:56.284
It matters how cool it looks, like it's
green or it's white or juicy and fat.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.481
- All right.
- Thanks for that.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.846
- Who's first?
- That was terrible.

43:03.360 --> 43:04.407
<i>I'll go!</i>

43:08.800 --> 43:09.801
<i>Sissies.</i>

43:13.400 --> 43:15.084
What the fuck!

43:19.560 --> 43:21.847
Oh, holy shit! We just got showed up
by a girl.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.201
Do we have to do that now?

43:23.400 --> 43:24.401
Yes.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.721
<i>Come on!</i>

43:26.520 --> 43:28.090
Oh, shit.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.963
I already won! We already won!

43:42.200 --> 43:43.850
They're down! Yes!

44:11.360 --> 44:12.851
<i>Ah, fuck! What was that?</i>

44:13.040 --> 44:14.565
Something just touched my foot right here.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.207
That work?

44:18.360 --> 44:19.964
- Where are we looking?
- Right here, right here!

44:20.160 --> 44:21.161
It's a turtle.

44:54.440 --> 44:56.568
News flash, Ben. School's out for summa!

44:56.760 --> 44:58.285
Oh, that? That's not school stuff.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.289
- Who sent you this?
- No one. Give it...

45:01.440 --> 45:02.521
No one.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.121
- What's with the history project?
- Oh...

45:08.720 --> 45:12.088
When I first moved here,
I didn't have anyone to hang out with,

45:12.640 --> 45:14.882
so I just started spending time
in the library.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.090
<i>You went to the library?</i>

45:18.080 --> 45:19.320
On purpose?

45:19.560 --> 45:20.925
Oh, I wanna see.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.325
<i>What's The Black Spot?</i>

45:25.560 --> 45:26.721
<i>The Black Spot was a nightclub</i>

45:26.880 --> 45:28.291
<i>that was burned down years ago
by that racist cult.</i>

45:28.800 --> 45:30.086
<i>The what?</i>

45:30.240 --> 45:31.241
<i>Don't you watch</i> Geraldo?

45:32.600 --> 45:34.443
Your hair...

45:36.800 --> 45:38.643
Your... Your hair is beautiful, Beverly.

45:38.840 --> 45:39.887
Oh.

45:40.920 --> 45:42.650
Right. Thanks.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.003
<i>Here, pass it.</i>

45:52.600 --> 45:54.091
Why is it all murders and missing kids?

45:54.760 --> 45:57.127
Derry's not like any town
I've ever been in before.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.970
They did a study once, and it turns out

46:01.800 --> 46:05.168
people die or disappear
six times the national average.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.611
You read that?

46:09.200 --> 46:11.009
<i>And that's just grown-ups.</i>

46:11.200 --> 46:12.850
Kids are worse.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.520
Way, way worse.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.084
I've got more stuff if you wanna see it.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.407
No, no.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.244
<i>Don't freak out, just tell us.</i>

46:51.400 --> 46:53.721
<i>Yeah. I heard he has
a rollercoaster and a pet chimp</i>

46:53.920 --> 46:56.685
and an old guy's fucking bones. Yeah.

46:58.360 --> 46:59.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:59.800 --> 47:00.801
Wow.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.081
Cool, huh?

47:02.760 --> 47:04.922
No. No, nothing cool.

47:05.120 --> 47:07.043
<i>There's nothing cool.</i>

47:07.760 --> 47:11.526
This is cool, right here.
Wait, no. No, it's not cool.

47:11.760 --> 47:13.046
What's that?

47:13.240 --> 47:16.050
Oh, that? That's the charter
for Derry Township.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.765
Nerd alert.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.281
No, actually, it's really interesting.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.244
Derry started as a beaver trapping camp.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.602
Still is, am I right, boys?

47:24.760 --> 47:27.445
Ninety-one people signed the charter
that made Derry.

47:27.600 --> 47:31.446
<i>But later that winter,
they all disappeared without a trace.</i>

47:31.600 --> 47:32.965
The entire camp?

47:33.240 --> 47:37.287
<i>There were rumors of Indians,</i>
but no sign of an attack.

47:38.280 --> 47:41.125
<i>Everybody just thought
it was a plague or something.</i>

47:41.320 --> 47:42.606
<i>But it's like</i>

47:43.440 --> 47:46.285
<i>one day everybody just woke up and left.</i>

47:47.440 --> 47:51.570
The only clue was a trail of
bloody clothes leading to the well house.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.565
<i>Jesus. We can get Derry</i>
<i>on</i> Unsolved Mysteries.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.883
- Let's do that. You're brilliant.
- I might be.

48:04.960 --> 48:05.961
I don't know.

48:06.160 --> 48:08.561
Maybe he's just trying to
make some friends, Stanley.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.731
Where was the well house?

48:11.720 --> 48:13.962
I don't know. Somewhere in town, I guess.

48:14.360 --> 48:15.407
<i>Why?</i>

48:15.640 --> 48:16.801
Nothing.

48:19.600 --> 48:23.161
<i>Nobody knows the trouble I've seen</i>

48:23.320 --> 48:25.004
<i>Nobody knows my sorrow</i>

49:15.640 --> 49:17.643
<i>Eddie...</i>

49:20.920 --> 49:23.491
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

49:26.040 --> 49:27.849
Oh!

49:28.240 --> 49:30.607
Fuck. My mom's gonna fucking flip.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.200
Do you think this will help me, Eddie?

49:59.200 --> 50:01.771
Help! Help!

50:21.960 --> 50:23.883
Where you going, Eds?

50:24.640 --> 50:27.246
If you lived here, you'd be home by now.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.727
Come join the clown, Eds.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.811
<i>You'll float down here.</i>

50:34.240 --> 50:36.129
We all float down here.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.606
Yes, we do.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.606
"Your hair is winter fire...

51:36.400 --> 51:38.721
"January embers...

51:39.480 --> 51:41.960
"My heart burns there, too."

51:54.760 --> 51:56.000
<i>Beverly...</i>

52:00.080 --> 52:02.083
<i>Beverly.</i>

52:03.520 --> 52:04.965
<i>Help me.</i>

52:09.120 --> 52:10.485
<i>Help me, please.</i>

52:14.520 --> 52:18.764
<i>We all want to meet you, Beverly.</i>

52:19.560 --> 52:23.326
<i>We all float down here.</i>

52:27.160 --> 52:30.243
Hello? Who are you?

52:30.440 --> 52:32.488
- <i>I'm Veronica.</i>
- <i>Betty Ripsom.</i>

52:32.680 --> 52:34.330
<i>Patrick Hockstetter.</i>

52:34.920 --> 52:35.967
<i>Come closer.</i>

52:36.120 --> 52:38.282
- <i>Wanna see?</i>
- <i>We float.</i>

52:38.480 --> 52:40.403
<i>We change.</i>

53:50.760 --> 53:51.761
<i>Daddy!</i>

53:51.920 --> 53:53.047
Help!

53:53.240 --> 53:54.651
Help!

54:30.680 --> 54:31.841
The hell's going on?

54:34.840 --> 54:36.570
The sink...

54:40.120 --> 54:41.690
And the blood... It's...

54:42.040 --> 54:43.724
What blood?

54:45.360 --> 54:49.524
The sink. You don't see it?

54:51.040 --> 54:52.087
<i>There was blood.</i>

55:00.920 --> 55:02.570
You worry me, Bevvie.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.888
<i>You worry me a lot.</i>

55:06.040 --> 55:08.885
But don't you see?

55:09.080 --> 55:11.322
Why'd you do this to your hair?

55:12.600 --> 55:14.728
Makes you look like a boy.

57:39.680 --> 57:41.284
Georgie.

58:27.200 --> 58:30.090
<i>I lost it, Billy. Don't be mad.</i>

58:32.880 --> 58:35.281
I'm not mad at you.

58:44.080 --> 58:46.048
It just floated off.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.440
But, Bill, if you'll come with me,

58:53.600 --> 58:55.762
you'll float, too.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.121
Georgie.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.089
You'll float, too. You'll float, too.

59:00.280 --> 59:02.248
<i>You'll float, too.</i>

59:02.440 --> 59:04.204
- You'll float, too.
- You'll float, too.

59:04.400 --> 59:07.404
<i>You'll float, too. You'll float, too.</i>

59:07.640 --> 59:08.926
<i>You'll float, too.</i>

59:09.120 --> 59:12.727
You'll float, too! You'll float, too!

59:12.920 --> 59:15.890
You'll float, too!

59:16.760 --> 59:18.410
You'll float, too!

59:34.160 --> 59:35.321
<i>No, we gotta go through the alleyway.</i>

59:35.480 --> 59:38.125
- <i>The alley takes way too long.</i>
- <i>No, the alley is so much faster.</i>

59:38.320 --> 59:39.685
<i>The alley is more dangerous
and it's disgusting.</i>

59:39.840 --> 59:42.485
- <i>How is it more dangerous?</i>
- <i>It smells like piss and it's gross.</i>

59:42.680 --> 59:44.330
- <i>Just take the side streets for once.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

59:44.600 --> 59:47.171
<i>The side streets are the same.
They smell like piss and shit.</i>

59:47.320 --> 59:49.402
<i>Okay, okay. Can you just tell me
what she said exactly?</i>

59:49.640 --> 59:50.641
<i>She didn't say anything.</i>

59:50.800 --> 59:51.847
<i>She just said that
you guys need to hurry over.</i>

59:52.000 --> 59:53.365
She didn't say anything. Okay. Okay.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.089
You made it. I...

59:56.320 --> 59:57.845
I need to show you something.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.161
What is it?

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.487
More than we saw at the quarry?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.011
Shut up! Just shut up, Richie.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.207
My dad will kill me if he finds out
I had boys in the apartment.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.849
Then we'll leave a lookout.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.202
Richie, stay here.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.647
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What if her dad comes back?

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.841
Do what you always do. Start talking.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.120
It is a gift.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.281
In there.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.205
<i>What is it?</i>

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.686
<i>You'll see.</i>

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.564
Are you taking us to your bathroom?

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.007
I just want you to know that 89%
of the worst accidents in homes

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.043
are caused in bathrooms.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.005
And, I mean, that's where
all the bacteria and fungi are

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.402
and it's not a really sanitary place...

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.245
<i>I knew it!</i>

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.401
<i>You see it?</i>

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.165
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>What...</i>

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.721
<i>What happened in here?</i>

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.561
My dad couldn't see it.
I thought I might be crazy.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.928
<i>Well, if you're crazy, then we're all crazy.</i>

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.243
We can't leave it like this.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.166
<i>All right, so you've</i>

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.481
<i>never been to the Derry Summer Fair?</i>

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.847
No, I don't think so.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.251
<i>Not that I know of.</i>

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.162
<i>Well, I go there every year,</i>

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.529
<i>but I was there one time with Richie and
technically won 'cause I hit the target.</i>

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.321
<i>But there were so many prizes,
I didn't know which to pick.</i>

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.002
It's not true, you know.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.611
What they say about me.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.522
I was only ever kissed by one guy.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.323
It was a long time ago.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.328
It was a nice kiss though.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.890
"January embers."

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.529
Was that in the play?

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.290
No, the poem.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.851
Oh...

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.203
Oh, I don't really know much poetry.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.483
Oh. I was just...

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.647
Never mind then.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.881
Um...

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.570
Just so you know, I...

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.802
I never believed any of the rumors.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.083
And none of us Losers do.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.891
We like hanging with you.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.766
Thanks.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.923
You shouldn't thank us too much.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.163
Hanging out with us makes you a Loser, too.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.251
I can take that.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.923
No, I love being
your personal doorman, really.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.730
Could you idiots have taken any longer?

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.769
- All right, shut up, Richie.
- Yeah, shut up, Richie.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.366
Oh, okay, trash the trashmouth, I get it.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.449
Hey, I wasn't the one
scrubbing the bathroom floor

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.923
and imagining that her sink went all
Eddie's mom's vagina on Halloween.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.123
She didn't imagine it.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.601
I...

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.202
I saw something, too.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.407
You saw blood, too?

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.441
Not blood.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.291
I saw Georgie.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.803
It seemed so real.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.043
I mean, it seemed like him,
but there was this...

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.961
The clown.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.411
Yeah, I saw him, too.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.006
Wait, can only virgins see this stuff?

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.730
Is that why I'm not seeing this shit?

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.291
<i>Oh, shit, that's Belch Huggins' car.</i>

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.930
- We should probably get outta here.
- Yeah.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.487
Wait, isn't that the homeschooled kid's bike?

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.761
<i>Yeah, that's Mike's.</i>

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.331
We have to help him.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.766
We should?

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.961
Yes.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.684
<i>Come on.</i>

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.161
<i>Eat that meat!</i>

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.851
- Eat it, bitch!
- You little fucker!

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.650
- Bitch!
- Motherfucker!

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.126
- <i>Eat it, you little bitch!</i>
- <i>Pussy!</i>

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.361
<i>Fucking...</i>

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.687
<i>Whatcha gonna do, huh?</i>

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.841
Get up!

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.281
Get the fuck up!

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.681
You little fucker!

01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.801
Come on, Henry, smack him!

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.047
You little bitch.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.367
- Nice throw.
- Thanks.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.965
<i>You losers are trying too hard.</i>

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.847
She'll do you.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.849
<i>You just gotta ask nicely,</i>

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.563
like I did.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.011
What the fuck?

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.921
<i>Come on, get 'em! Fuck!</i>

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.491
Rock war!

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.363
- Get 'em!
- Watch out!

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.684
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.361
Eddie!

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.601
- <i>Fuck outta here!</i>
- Ow!

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.401
Ah, shit!

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.162
Fuck you, bitch!

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.281
Come on, guys! Let's get 'em!

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.851
- Fuck this.
- <i>Fuck out of here.</i>

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.604
<i>Fuck you, losers!</i>

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.246
Go blow your dad, you mullet-wearing asshole!

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.124
Thanks, guys,
but you shouldn't have done that.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.925
They'll be after you guys, too, now.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.647
Oh, no, no, no. Bowers? He's always after us.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.171
I guess that's one thing
we all have in common.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.768
Yeah, Homeschool.
Welcome to the Losers' Club.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.881
<i>Right there.</i>

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.047
<i>They say they found part of his hand
all chewed up near the Standpipe.</i>

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.564
He asked to borrow a pencil once.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.562
It's like she's been forgotten
because Corcoran's missing.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.361
Is it ever gonna end?

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.765
What the fuck, dude?

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.564
What are you guys talking about?

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.804
What they always talk about.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.444
I actually think it will end.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.165
For a little while, at least.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:28.361
What do you mean?

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.163
So I was going over all my Derry research
and I charted out all the big events.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.408
The Ironworks explosion in 1908,

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.330
the Bradley Gang in '35,

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.568
and The Black Spot in '62.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.723
And now kids being...

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.319
I realized this stuff seems to happen...

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.130
Every 27 years.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.651
<i>Okay, so, let me get this straight.</i>

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.082
<i>It comes out from wherever
to eat kids for, like, a year?</i>

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.162
<i>And then what? It just goes into hibernation?</i>

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:01.845
Maybe it's like... What do you call it?

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.247
Cicadas.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.522
You know, the bugs that come out
once every 17 years.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.443
My grandfather thinks this town is cursed.

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:14.404
He says that all the bad things that happen
in this town are because of one thing.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.325
An evil thing that feeds off
the people of Derry.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.724
But it can't be one thing.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.410
We all saw something different.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.081
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:26.680
Or maybe It knows what scares us most
and that's what we see.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.923
I saw a leper.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.162
He was like a walking infection.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.001
But you didn't.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.363
Because it isn't real.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.086
<i>None of this is.</i>

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.080
Not Eddie's leper

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.442
or Bill seeing Georgie

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.207
or the woman I keep seeing.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:47.361
She hot?

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.201
No, Richie.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.921
She's not hot.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.126
Her face is all messed up.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.046
<i>None of this makes any sense.</i>

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.284
They're all like bad dreams.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.128
I don't think so. I know the difference
between a bad dream and real life, okay?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.287
What'd you see? You saw something, too?

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.481
<i>Yes.</i>

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.851
Do you guys know that burned-down house
on Harris Avenue?

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.722
I was inside when it burned down.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.648
Before I was rescued, my mom and dad were
trapped in the next room over from me.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.482
They were pushing and pounding on the door,

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.245
trying to get to me.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.481
<i>Hurry, son!</i>

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.927
<i>It burns!</i>

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.211
But it was too hot.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.923
When the firemen finally found them,

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.848
the skin on their hands had
melted down to the bone.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.250
We're all afraid of something.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.091
Got that right.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.683
<i>Why, Rich? What are you afraid of?</i>

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.571
Clowns.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.887
Okay.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.247
Look.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.043
<i>That's where Georgie disappeared.</i>

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.043
<i>There's the Ironworks.</i>

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.810
<i>And The Black Spot.</i>

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.042
Everywhere it happens,
it's all connected by the sewers.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.727
And they all meet up at the...

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.126
The well house.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.401
It's in the house on Neibolt Street.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.569
You mean that creepy-ass house where
all the junkies and hobos like to sleep?

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.123
<i>I hate that place.</i>

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.802
It always feels like it's watching me.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.447
<i>That's where I saw It.</i>

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.890
That's where I saw the clown.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.285
That's where It lives.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.601
<i>I can't imagine anything
ever wanting to live there.</i>

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.046
Can we stop talking about this?

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.129
I can barely breathe.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.561
<i>This is summer.</i>

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.410
We're kids. I can barely breathe.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.931
I'm up here having a fucking asthma attack.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.771
I'm not doing this.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.965
What the hell? Put the map back.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.521
Mmm-mmm.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.765
What happened?

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.446
What's going on?

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.486
I got it. Hold on.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.327
Guys.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.920
Georgie.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.327
<i>Bill?</i>

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.526
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.481
<i>It's It!</i>

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.804
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.327
I don't fucking know!

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.644
Turn it off! Turn it off!

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.683
Yeah. Yeah, turn it off. Turn it off!

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.046
<i>Run, Stanley!</i>

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.526
What is it?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.847
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.041
Thanks, Ben.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.526
It saw us.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.211
It saw us, and it knows where we are.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.841
It always did.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.930
So, let's go.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.767
Go?

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.441
Go where?

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.727
Neibolt.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.369
That's where Georgie is.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.886
After that?

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.881
Yeah, it's summer. We should be outside.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.930
If you say it's summer
one more fucking time...

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.641
<i>Bill!</i>

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.931
Wait!

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.681
"He thrusts his fists

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.848
"against the posts

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.243
"and still insists he sees..."

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.527
Bill!

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.329
Bill, you can't go in there.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.527
This is crazy.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.524
Look, you don't have to come in with me.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.808
But what happens when
another Georgie goes missing?

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.043
Or another Betty?
Or another Ed Corcoran? Or one of us?

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.128
Are you just gonna pretend it isn't
happening like everyone else in this town?

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.089
Because I can't.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.964
I go home, and all I see is
that Georgie isn't there.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.966
His clothes, his toys,
his stupid stuffed animals, but...

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.165
<i>He isn't.</i>

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.723
So walking into this house,

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.404
for me,

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.126
it's easier than walking into my own.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.481
<i>Wow.</i>

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.761
<i>What?</i>

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.445
He didn't stutter once.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.647
Wait!

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.206
Um...

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.809
Shouldn't we have some people keep watch?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.685
You know, just in case something bad happens?

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.326
Who wants to stay out here?

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.641
Fuck.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.528
I can't believe I pulled the short straw.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.364
<i>You guys are lucky
you're not measuring dicks.</i>

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.005
<i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.045
<i>I can smell it.</i>

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.131
Don't breathe through your mouth.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.361
How come?

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.484
Because then you're eating it.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.241
What?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.730
It... It says I'm missing.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.885
You're not missing, Richie.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.445
"Police department, City of Derry."

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.206
That's my shirt. That's my hair.
That's my face.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.441
Calm down, this isn't real.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.886
That's my name. That's my age!
That's the date!

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.081
It can't be real, Richie.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.771
No, it says it! What the fuck?

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.446
- Am I missing? Am I gonna go missing?
- Calm down. Calm down.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.523
Look at me, Richie. Look at me.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.443
That... That isn't real.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.603
It's playing tricks on you.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.760
<i>Hello?</i>

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.571
<i>Hello?</i>

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.643
<i>Help me, please!</i>

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.161
Betty?

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.761
Ripsom?

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.491
<i>Eddie...</i>

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.527
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.365
Guys, can you hear that?

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.803
<i>She was just here. Where the fuck did she go?</i>

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.360
Guys.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.644
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.211
Guys. Guys!

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.881
- <i>Guys! Guys!</i>
- What? Eddie?

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.289
What the fuck?

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.371
Time to take your pill, Eddie.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.446
- Eddie. Open the door!
- <i>Richie.</i>

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.486
<i>You okay?</i>

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.441
<i>Eddie, what's going on?</i>

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.761
Eds.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.601
<i>Eddie.</i>

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.281
<i>Come here, Richie.</i>

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.807
Eddie.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.447
<i>Eddie.</i>

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.165
Eddie.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.165
Where the fuck are you?

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.324
<i>We're not playing hide-and-seek, dipshit.</i>

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.967
Richie?

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.291
Richie! Richie!

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.487
Bill, come on, open the door.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.761
<i>It won't open!</i>

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.445
- <i>What's going on? Richie!</i>
- I can't!

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.687
<i>Open the door, Rich.</i>

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.801
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.845
Stupid clowns.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.881
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.321
<i>Ugh!</i>

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.406
Beep-beep, Richie.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.961
Let's get outta here.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.371
You wanna play loogie?

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.560
Time to float.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.441
<i>Where's my shoe?</i>

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.487
Where the fuck were her legs?

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.329
Holy shit, what the fuck was that?

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.481
This isn't real.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.966
Remember the missing kid poster.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.730
That wasn't real, so this isn't real.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.523
Tasty, tasty, beautiful fear.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.881
Come on. Ready?

01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.087
<i>No!</i>

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.521
No.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.400
No, no!

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.800
Oh, thank fuck.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.367
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- <i>Help!</i>

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.045
<i>Help!</i>

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.361
Eddie!

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.924
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.161
Eddie!

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.721
This isn't real enough for you, Billy?

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.730
I'm not real enough for you?

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.405
Oh, shit.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.047
It was real enough for Georgie.

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.481
Holy shit!

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.886
- Get Eddie!
- Get Eddie!

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.681
Oh, fuck! We gotta get out of here!

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.881
- <i>Get Eddie. Let's go!</i>
- <i>Guys, watch out!</i>

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.969
- No, no, no, no!
- Eddie, look at me!

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.043
He's gonna get us! Guys!

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.571
<i>No!</i>

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.604
<i>Ben!</i>

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.801
Ben!

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.447
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.931
Don't let him get away!

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.771
<i>Bill, we have to help Eddie!</i>

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.610
No! No!

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.965
I'm gonna snap your arm into place.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.201
Rich, do not fucking touch me.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.808
- Okay, one, two, three.
- Do not touch me!

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.124
Holy shit!

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.647
You. You did this.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.724
You know how delicate he is.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.884
- We were attacked, Mrs. K.
- No. Don't.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.643
Don't try and blame anyone else.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.526
- Let me help.
- Get back!

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.803
Oh, I've heard of you, Miss Marsh.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.049
And I don't want a dirty girl like you
touching my son.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.925
Mrs. K, I...

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:21.164
No! You are all monsters. All of you.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.331
And Eddie is done with you.
Do you hear? Done!

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.281
I saw the well.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.443
We know where it is

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.286
and next time we'll be better prepared.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.521
No!

01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.521
No next time, Bill.

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.684
- You're insane.
- <i>Why?</i>

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.406
We all know no one else
is going to do anything.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.887
Eddie was nearly killed!
And look at this motherfucker.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.923
He's leaking Hamburger Helper!

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.201
<i>We can't pretend it's gonna go away.</i>

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.125
Ben, you said it yourself,
It comes back every 27 years.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.205
Fine! I'll be 40 and far away from here.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.163
I thought you said you wanted to
get out of this town, too.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.205
Because I wanna run towards something.
Not away.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.848
I'm sorry, who invited Molly Ringwald
into the group?

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.168
- Richie...
- I'm just saying, let's face facts.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.401
Real world.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.251
Georgie is dead.
Stop trying to get us killed, too.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.441
Georgie's not dead.

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.240
You couldn't save him,
but you can still save yourself.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.246
No, take it back.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.243
You're scared and we all are,
but take it back!

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.881
Bill!

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.528
You're just a bunch of losers!

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.921
- Fuck off!
- Richie, stop.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.043
You're just a bunch of losers
and you'll get yourselves killed

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.368
- trying to catch a fucking stupid clown.
- Stop!

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.124
This is what It wants.

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.640
It wants to divide us.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.080
We were all together when we hurt It.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.288
That's why we're still alive.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.131
Yeah? Well, I plan to keep it that way.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.963
- Mike...
- Guys...

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.242
I can't do this.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.490
My granddad was right.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.645
I'm an outsider. Gotta stay that way.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.970
- Yeah! Bonus!
- Yeah, there we go.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.645
Put the next target out there.

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.450
<i>Just hold it.</i>

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.883
What the hell's going on here?

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:05.723
Just cleaning your gun, like you asked.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.407
You're cleaning my gun, huh?

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.202
- Dad...
- Hey!

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.210
Look at him now, boys.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.881
Ain't nothing like a little fear
to make a paper man crumble.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.481
<i>Here for the refills, Eddie?</i>

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.681
Yeah.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.251
<i>You know it's all bullshit, right?</i>

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.681
What is?

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.441
Your medication.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.331
<i>They're placebos.</i>

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.521
What's placebo mean?

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.205
Placebo means bullshit.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.440
No friends, huh?

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.401
<i>Your cast.</i>

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.485
No signatures or anything?

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.961
So sad.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.850
I didn't want it to get dirty.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.085
I'll sign it for you.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.845
You okay, Henry?

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.769
<i>And this is my most</i>
<i>favorite part of the afternoon.</i>

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.850
<i>Getting to know all about so many of you.</i>

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.003
<i>Is there someone here
that wants to share with us</i>

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.964
- <i>what they most enjoyed about today?</i>
- <i>Me!</i>

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.607
- <i>How about you?</i>
- <i>I liked seeing the clown.</i>

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.767
- <i>You did? You liked the clown?</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.006
- <i>What about the rest of you?</i>
- <i>I liked when the bubbles float.</i>

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.129
<i>You did? Me too.</i>

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.562
<i>I just love watching things float.</i>

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.761
<i>We all float.</i>

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.160
<i>That's right.</i>

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.442
<i>And you will, too, Henry.</i>

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.483
<i>Make it a wonderful day.</i>

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.011
<i>Kill him.</i>

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.082
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.370
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.450
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.691
<i>Oh, no. Give a big round of applause!</i>

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.245
<i>Well done, Henry.</i>

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:42.643
<i>Kill them all. Kill them all.</i>

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.963
<i>Kill them all!</i>

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.931
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all! Kill them all!</i>

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.483
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all! Kill them all!</i>

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.801
<i>Where are you sneaking off to?</i>

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.450
Nowhere, Daddy.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.248
You're looking prettied up.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.568
I'm not prettied up, Daddy.
I wear this almost every day.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.051
Come.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.371
<i>You know I worry about you, Bevvie.</i>

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.121
I know.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.442
People in town have been
saying some things to me about you.

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:04.529
Sneaking around all summer long
with a bunch of boys.

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.889
<i>The only girl in the pack.</i>

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.526
They're just friends, I swear.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:15.569
I know what's in boys' minds
when they look at you, Bevvie.

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.842
I know all too well.

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.844
My hand...

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.485
Are you doing womanly things
down in the woods with those boys?

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.287
No, no, no, nothing.
You don't have to worry. I promise.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.921
What's this?

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.528
It's nothing. It's just a poem.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.327
Just a poem?

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.881
But you had to hide it
in your underwear drawer.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.491
Why would you have to hide it there?

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.165
Are you still my girl?

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.601
No.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.881
What did you say?

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.329
I said, no!

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.481
No!

01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.769
Get away, no!

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.045
Get off!

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.561
No!

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.921
Those boys. Do they know that you're my...

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.810
Beverly?

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.371
Beverly!

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.327
- Richie.
- What do you want?

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.207
<i>See that guy I'm hitting?
I'm pretending it's you.</i>

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.641
It got Beverly.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.285
What are you talking about?

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.125
It, Richie.

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.524
It got Beverly.

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.447
Hello?

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.600
Okay.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.685
I'll meet you there.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.851
And just where do you think you're off to?

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.327
Out with my friends.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.521
Sweetie, you can't go.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.410
You're getting over your sickness, remember?

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.645
My sickness?

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.763
Okay, what sickness, Ma?

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.606
You know what these are? They're gazebos!

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.961
They're bullshit!

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.289
They help you, Eddie.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.884
I had to protect you.

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.451
Protect me?

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.610
By lying to me? By keeping me locked
inside this hellhole?

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.211
I'm sorry but the only people that were

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.602
actually trying to protect me
were my friends.

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.042
And you made me turn my back on them
when I really needed them.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.241
So I'm going.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.210
Eddie. Eddie. No.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.447
You get back here.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.444
- Sorry, Mom, I gotta go save my friends.
- Eddie!

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.284
Don't do this to me, Eddie!

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.121
Guys, spikes.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.601
Stan?

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.969
Stan, we all have to go.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.288
<i>Beverly was right.</i>

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.006
If we split up like last time,
that clown will kill us one by one.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.845
<i>But if we stick together,</i>

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.646
all of us,

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.891
we'll win.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.761
<i>I promise.</i>

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.131
Hey, Eddie, you got a quarter?

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.842
I wouldn't want to make a wish
in that fucking thing.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.524
Beverly?

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.926
How are we supposed to get down there?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.525
All right. Come on.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.811
All right.

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.088
Guys, guys. Help.

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.685
- All right, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.250
<i>Step right up, Beverly. Step right up.</i>

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.440
<i>Come change. Come float.
You'll laugh. You'll cry.</i>

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.088
<i>You'll cheer. You'll die.</i>

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.846
<i>Introducing Pennywise the Dancing Clown.</i>

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.764
I'm not afraid of you.

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.211
You will be.

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.486
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.560
Ahhh!

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.041
Die!

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.247
Mike!

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.931
- Mike!
- Mike!

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.290
<i>You okay? Mike!</i>

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.801
<i>Bowers.</i>

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.407
Mike. Fuck.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.331
- <i>Mike!</i>
- <i>Where is he?</i>

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.841
<i>We're next.</i>

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.651
<i>No, no, no!</i>

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.046
- Grab it!
- Get the rope! Get the rope!

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.761
Oh, shit.

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.611
- <i>Mike!</i>
- <i>Mike!</i>

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.011
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.802
You didn't listen to what I told you,
did you?

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.806
You should've stayed out of Derry.

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:28.850
Your parents didn't
and look what happened to them.

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:32.531
I still get sad every time
I pass by that pile of ashes.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.206
Sad,

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.651
that I couldn't have done it myself.

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.250
<i>Run, Mike!</i>

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:46.920
Mike!

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:49.241
Fuck down!

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:54.328
I should get up there.

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.648
Are you insane? With what?

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.571
<i>Holy shit.</i>

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.450
- Oh, my...
- Mike!

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.485
I'm okay.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.245
<i>I'm okay.</i>

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.401
Shoot!

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.525
<i>Stanley.</i>

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.771
<i>Beverly?</i>

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.211
<i>Is that you?</i>

01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.807
Guys?

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.527
Guys?

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.963
- What?
- Guys, where's Stan?

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.161
Stanley!

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:12.600
Stanley!

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.807
Stan!

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.005
Oh, shit. Greywater.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.001
Stan?

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.087
Stan?

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.361
Stanley!

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.884
- Stan!
- Shit! Stan!

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.007
Stanley!

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.450
- We're coming, man!
- We're coming! Don't worry.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:02.161
- Stan?
- Stanley! Stan!

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:03.361
His flashlight!

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:09.004
<i>What the fuck is that thing?</i>

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.321
Oh, shit.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.681
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.241
Oh, shit!

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.081
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:30.167
Stanley!

01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.169
- Stanley! Stan!
- Stanley!

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.489
No! No! No!

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.687
It's okay.

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.764
You left me! You took me into Neibolt!

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.007
You're not my friends!

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.043
You made me go into Neibolt!

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.965
- <i>Stanley, I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>You made me go into Neibolt!</i>

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.570
<i>This is your fault.</i>

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.244
<i>We would never let anything happen to you.</i>

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.481
<i>We're here for you.</i>

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.923
You know we wouldn't do that to you. Come on.

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.202
Bill! Bill!

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:03.161
Bill!

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.560
<i>Bill!</i>

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:37.806
Beverly!

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.925
I'll come back for you, Bev.

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:14.881
Bill!

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.081
Bill!

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:23.007
Bill!

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:24.646
<i>Come on.</i>

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.205
Get out of there, dude. That's greywater.

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.562
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, my fucking flashlight?

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:30.404
Eddie!

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.167
Come on, let's get the fuck
out of here! Come on!

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.324
- Holy shit.
- Bev? Bev?

01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.850
- Beverly?
- Holy shit.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.761
Bev.

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.689
<i>How is she in the air?</i>

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.205
Guys.

01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.607
Are those...

01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:16.886
<i>The missing kids.</i>

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.041
<i>Floating.</i>

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.563
- Just let me grab her.
- Shit.

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.486
<i>I'm slipping.</i>

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:38.881
Bev.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.571
Beverly.

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.404
Why isn't she waking up?

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:45.324
What is wrong with her?

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.642
Beverly, please! Come on!

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.967
Wow.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.841
<i>Bev?</i>

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.931
"January embers"

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.647
"My heart burns there too"

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:20.603
Jesus, fuck.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.491
Oh, God.

01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:34.005
Where's Bill?

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.886
<i>Georgie.</i>

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.891
What took you so long?

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.005
I was looking for you this whole time.

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.405
I couldn't find my way outta here.

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.726
He said I could have my boat back, Billy.

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.606
Was she fast?

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:11.687
I couldn't keep up with it.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.161
"She," Georgie.

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.810
You call boats "she."

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.528
Take me home, Billy.

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.370
I wanna go home.

01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:40.721
<i>I miss you. I wanna be with Mom and Dad.</i>

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:46.202
I want more than anything for you to be home.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.530
With Mom and Dad.

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.046
I miss you so much.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.604
I love you, Billy.

01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:05.645
I love you, too.

01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:16.125
But you're not Georgie.

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.447
- Kill It, Bill! Kill It!
- <i>Shit.</i>

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.330
<i>Kill It, Bill!</i>

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.406
Kill It! Bill, Kill It!

01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.321
<i>Kill It!</i>

01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:11.481
- Kill It!
- Kill!

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:12.641
Kill It!

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.201
It's not loaded.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.647
Do it now, Bill! Kill It! Kill It!

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.491
Hey! It's not loaded!

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.005
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:26.370
Oh, shit.

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:34.921
<i>Bill, watch out!</i>

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.601
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.641
<i>Beverly, no!</i>

01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.881
<i>Mike!</i>

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.281
<i>Help him!</i>

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.170
Fuck!

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.921
Ben!

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:01.403
<i>Stanley!</i>

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.366
Bill!

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.681
<i>Bill!</i>

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:13.765
<i>No, don't.</i>

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.521
Let him go.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.847
No.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.889
I'll take him.

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.048
I'll take all of you.

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:26.050
<i>And I'll feast on your flesh
as I feed on your fear.</i>

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:31.204
Or,

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.202
you'll just leave us be.

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:38.443
I will take him, only him

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:41.202
and then I will have my long rest

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:45.530
and you will all live to grow and thrive

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:49.242
and lead happy lives

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:53.601
until old age takes you back to the weeds.

01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.646
Leave...

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.048
I'm the one who dragged you all into this.

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.922
I'm so sorry.

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.167
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:13.728
Go!

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:16.971
Guys, we can't!

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:20.564
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:24.491
I told you, Bill.

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.246
<i>I fucking told you.</i>

01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:29.243
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.251
It's your fault.

01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.603
You punched me in the face.

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.285
You made me walk through shitty water.

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.965
You brought me to a fucking crackhead house.

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.931
And now...

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.324
I'm gonna have to kill this fucking clown.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:49.764
Welcome to the Losers' Club, asshole!

01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:58.925
- Mike!
- Mike!

02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:05.847
<i>Stan, watch out!</i>

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:09.681
Mike!

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.161
<i>Kill him!</i>

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:50.529
I'm gonna kill you!

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:58.885
<i>Hey, Bevvie. Are you still my little...</i>

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:09.521
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.528
That's why you didn't kill Beverly.

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:36.049
'Cause she wasn't afraid.

02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:38.524
<i>And we aren't either.</i>

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:40.765
<i>Not anymore.</i>

02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.282
Now you're the one who's afraid.

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.565
Because you're gonna starve.

02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.251
<i>"He thrusts his fists against the posts</i>

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:01.882
<i>"and still insists he sees the ghosts</i>

02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.164
<i>"He thrusts his fists against the posts"</i>

02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:25.767
Fear...

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.530
I know what I'm doing
for my summer experience essay.

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.408
Guys. Guys.

02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:59.122
The kids are floating down.

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.286
I can only remember parts,

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.130
I thought I was dead.

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.290
That's what it felt like.

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:30.723
I saw us, all of us together
back in the cistern,

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.809
but we were older,

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.522
like, our parents' ages.

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:39.882
What were we all doing there?

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.488
I just remember how we felt.

02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.764
<i>How scared we were.</i>

02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:48.327
I don't think I can ever forget that.

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:54.721
Swear it.

02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.086
Swear

02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.603
if It isn't dead,

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.728
if It ever comes back, we'll come back, too.

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.647
<i>I gotta go.</i>

02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:33.481
I hate you.

02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:45.604
I'll see you later.

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:46.921
<i>Bye, Stan.</i>

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:53.607
Bye, guys.

02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:56.001
- Bye, Mike.
- See you later, losers.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.207
- See you around, Bill.
- See you, Rich.

02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.441
See you guys later.

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:04.611
Bye, Ben.

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:12.045
You all packed for Portland?

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.202
Yeah, pretty much.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.880
I'm going tomorrow morning.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:18.883
How long will you be gone?

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:24.725
My aunt, she says I can stay
for as long as I want, so...

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.245
Just so you know...

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.488
I never felt like a loser
when I was with all of you.

02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:45.365
See you around.

02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:34.121
Bye.
