00:13.999 --> 00:16.999
- This season
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:16.999 --> 00:17.999
- Let's go!

00:20.999 --> 00:24.999
- Whoo!♪ ♪

00:25.999 --> 00:26.999
- Something's going on
and I don't like it.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.999
I smell trouble.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- Just don't break
any more hearts.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
- I'm sure people
have warned you about me.

00:32.999 --> 00:33.999
- Of course.

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
- I do definitely need
another girl's name

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
tattooed on my arm.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.999
- I love you.

00:37.999 --> 00:39.999
- So who did you f***
Friday night? I'm curious.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
- I swear to you
we did not have sex.

00:41.999 --> 00:42.999
- You're a f***ing liar.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
- James leaves Kristen
and now he's hooking up

00:44.999 --> 00:46.999
with the new girl.

00:46.999 --> 00:47.999
- I'm Lala.
- I'm Lala.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- Lala.
- Lala's like that pretty,

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
hot girl that wants
to be a slut,

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
but won't admit she's a slut,
but really,

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
she's a huge slut.

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
- Some people call me
a bitch,

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
but I just call it
having a f***ing badass life.

00:57.999 --> 01:00.999
- Sit the f*** down.
- All right, all right!

01:00.999 --> 01:01.999
- Chill the f*** out
about your goddamn band

01:01.999 --> 01:02.999
and your stupid-ass music.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.999
- Aah!

01:04.999 --> 01:05.999
- Stop making everybody
look like sh**

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
because you're too much
of a pussy to admit

01:07.999 --> 01:08.999
to admit
to your f***ing wrong-doing.

01:08.999 --> 01:11.999
- He's just been drinking,
like, so much lately.

01:11.999 --> 01:12.999
- You're addicted to pills?

01:12.999 --> 01:14.999
- Ever since I've
known you guys.

01:14.999 --> 01:15.999
- Holy sh**.

01:15.999 --> 01:16.999
- He needs to get clean.

01:16.999 --> 01:17.999
He needs to take responsibility
for the fact

01:18.000 --> 01:19.999
that he's married this girl
and he needs

01:19.999 --> 01:21.000
to get his sh** together.

01:21.999 --> 01:22.999
- I moved up here and changed
my entire life

01:22.999 --> 01:23.999
to be with you.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.999
I had a f***ing boob job.

01:25.999 --> 01:26.999
- Surgery that I paid for.

01:26.999 --> 01:27.999
- You are nothing.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.999
You are the sh**
on the bottom of my shoe.

01:29.999 --> 01:31.999
I am the most powerful bitch
in the world.

01:31.999 --> 01:32.999
- I'm giving you a heads-up
that there's a war coming.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
- I just don't want
to hang out with Kristen!

01:34.999 --> 01:35.999
- That's fine.

01:35.999 --> 01:37.999
- Then f***ing let it go!

01:37.999 --> 01:38.999
- Jax just got arrested.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
- Who's gonna post the bail?

01:40.999 --> 01:41.999
- What can I do?
I'm locked in a cell.

01:41.999 --> 01:43.000
- I'm never gonna be nice
about you

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
until you radically change.

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
- How am I gonna
radically change?

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
- Maybe, like, a lobotomy
might help.

01:48.999 --> 01:49.999
- I can't make the commitment.

01:49.999 --> 01:53.000
- You've wimped out just like
a big, bloody wussy pussy.

01:53.999 --> 01:54.999
Katie Maloney...

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
- You're the love of my life.

01:58.999 --> 02:00.999
- Her perfect life
with her perfect boyfriend

02:00.999 --> 02:01.999
and her perfect,
stupid sh**

02:01.999 --> 02:03.999
is crumbling right now.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.999
- I can't believe
she's back in the picture.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
- Can I tell you
what I want?

02:07.999 --> 02:08.999
- What do you want?

02:10.999 --> 02:11.999
- You hate me, Lisa.

02:11.999 --> 02:12.999
- You're not important
enough to hate.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.999
Sit down.

- Good, Lisa.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
- Don't forget we've
got a meeting--two minutes.

02:54.999 --> 02:55.999
- Got it.

02:55.999 --> 02:57.999
- Last year was
incredibly demanding.

02:57.999 --> 03:00.999
I was focused
on opening Pump.

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
- Hello, you two.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
I'm thrilled to say
it's been a great success,

03:06.999 --> 03:10.999
but now I'm turning
my attention back to Sur.

03:10.999 --> 03:11.999
Katie!
- Yes.

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

03:12.999 --> 03:14.999
- Don't forget--meeting.
One minute.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
How are you?
You can kiss me.

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
- I'm great.
How are you?

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
- Mm. I'm good.
Are you coming to the meeting?

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999

Playtime's over.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.999
Just want to touch base
with you.

03:36.999 --> 03:37.999
See how you're all doing.

03:37.999 --> 03:40.999
We are having some renovations
done as you've seen.

03:40.999 --> 03:43.999
Giving Sur a lick of paint,
and obviously

03:43.999 --> 03:46.999
Jax is having his own
personal renovations done.

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
- I'm also renovating myself.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.999
This is round three
on my nose.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.000
- What's wrong with your ear?

03:54.999 --> 03:55.999
- The ear--so, what they did
is they took skin

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
from behind my ear...
- Oh.

03:57.999 --> 03:58.999
- And put it into my nose.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.999
After my second surgery,
I developed some calluses.

04:02.999 --> 04:03.999
It created a bump.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
I didn't like
the way it looked.

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
Vanity reasons, I went in
and I changed it--

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
again.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
- New, fresh menu.
We like this.

04:10.999 --> 04:12.999
- Wow, those are really pretty.

04:12.999 --> 04:13.999
- So we're making an effort.

04:13.999 --> 04:14.999
I also want to talk
about the fact

04:14.999 --> 04:18.999
that the service
has dropped from 18%

04:18.999 --> 04:21.999
to now it's 16-17%.
- Gratuity?

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:23.999 --> 04:26.999
- So our service
needs tweaking.

04:26.999 --> 04:27.999
I care a lot
about the gratuities

04:27.999 --> 04:29.999
not because it's money
in my pocket--

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
it's not--but it's
about the diner's experience

04:31.999 --> 04:34.999
and I'm always looking
for perfection.

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
You, I have a problem with.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
A glass of wine was thrown
at Pump.

04:38.999 --> 04:41.999
- Kristen yet again
tried to come into Pump

04:41.999 --> 04:43.999
and I've been DJ-ing
every single night.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
- Well, I need you
as a busser here.

04:49.999 --> 04:50.999
- I'm willing
to definitely work

04:50.999 --> 04:52.999
as as a busboy for you,
like, as long as I can

04:52.999 --> 04:53.999
keep DJ-ing.

04:53.999 --> 04:54.999
- You've been doing
a really good job.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.999
- Thank you.
- I totally support you on that.

04:56.999 --> 04:57.999
- Right.
- However, I want to hear

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
about the glass of wine.

04:59.999 --> 05:00.999
- I didn't throw
no glass of wine.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
Kristen's been coming in
with her friends.

05:02.999 --> 05:03.999
- Rachel, Carmen--
- Well, why is she coming

05:03.999 --> 05:04.999
into Pump?

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
- I don't know.
She's just day-drinking

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
on a Sunday--
I don't know.

05:06.999 --> 05:09.999
- On a Monday,
on a Tuesday.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
On a Wednesday.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
- Throughout the years,
me and Kristen

05:13.999 --> 05:14.999
definitely had our
ups and downs...

05:14.999 --> 05:16.999
and our downs.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.999
- She's the **** who hooked up
with my f***ing boyfriend.

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
- And our downs.
I want you to admit it to me!

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
- I'm not lying to you, Tom.

05:23.999 --> 05:24.999
- And our downs.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
I'm just tired of
arguing all the time, man.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
I'm just really glad
she's out of my life.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
Sorry, James,
I gotta say again--

05:31.999 --> 05:32.999
better you than me, pal.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
- So let's just make a decision
right now.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.999
Kristen is not in Pump and not
in Sur when you're working,

05:38.999 --> 05:40.999
okay?
- All right.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
I worked too hard
on becoming the DJ

05:42.999 --> 05:45.999
to go back to bussing
f***ing tables

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
because of Kristen.

05:46.999 --> 05:49.999
- There's still kind of problems
with some of you committing,

05:49.999 --> 05:53.000
you know, to the restaurant
and being lazy asses

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
and not showing up.

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
Tom, I'm looking at you mainly.

05:58.999 --> 06:02.999
You've worked probably
six shifts in months.

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
- That's not true.
- It is true.

06:04.999 --> 06:07.999
- That's not true, Lisa.
- A thousand percent it's true.

06:07.999 --> 06:10.999
- I know for a fact I'm one
of Lisa's best bartenders,

06:10.999 --> 06:14.999
but for some reason,
she's deciding to single me out.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
- When somebody's here one week
and then they're not here

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
for three weeks,
it doesn't work.

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
- Don't throw me under the bus
and make me look

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
like an ass****.
- You're under the bus

06:21.999 --> 06:22.999
and I'm driving it
backwards and forwards over you.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
I don't care.
No.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
I am 50-f***ing-4
years old.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.999
I deserve respect.

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
You want to go head-to-head
with me, Tom?

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
Bring it because you're not
going to win this one.

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
- We're doing
the best that we can.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.999
- Well, the best
isn't good enough.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
Okay, let's have
a great service tonight.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.999
We're good, but we gotta
get better, okay?

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
- You're welcome.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
- That meeting was interesting.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
- Um, I was scared
for a minute.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
It was coming from, like,
every angle.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.000
- I kinda just had to laugh.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
- Well, I'm, like,
looking forward

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
to your birthday.
- Me too.

07:04.999 --> 07:07.999
This last year has been
amazing.

07:07.999 --> 07:10.999
The wedding
was absolutely beautiful.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
- I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
Married life has been amazing.

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
I'm now going into
a new chapter of my life.

07:17.999 --> 07:18.999
I'm turning 30.

07:18.999 --> 07:22.999
I just want
to do something so fun,

07:22.999 --> 07:25.999
so we're gonna do
a decade-themed party

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
and, you know, any excuse
to be the center of attention

07:27.999 --> 07:30.999
isn't always the worst idea
for me.

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
I need to get a belt still.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.999
I'm doing "Like a Virgin"--
Madonna.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
- Scheana and I started becoming
good, close friends

07:37.999 --> 07:40.999
towards the end of last Summer
and Stassi and I's friendship

07:40.999 --> 07:41.999
was done.

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
- I have to deal
with these people and you are

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
the last link to them.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.999
- Oh, shut the f*** up, Stassi.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.999
I'm happy now,
and it is a little liberating.

07:50.999 --> 07:54.999
I heard a bit of information
about Stassi and Patrick.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.999
Apparently, like, they
were going through tough times

07:57.999 --> 07:59.999
and have decided that,
in order to resolve

07:59.999 --> 08:02.999
those tough times,
they need to live separately.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
- That's like Schwartz being,
like, "Hey, before

08:04.999 --> 08:05.999
"we get engaged,
I think I'm gonna move out

08:05.999 --> 08:07.999
"and live away from you
and then

08:07.999 --> 08:10.999
see if I want to come back."
Like, who does that?

08:10.999 --> 08:14.999
I better be a bridesmaid
in your wedding, bitch.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.999
It's gonna happen.
- We'll think about it.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.999
About nine months ago,
I gave Tom an ultimatum.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
Either put a ring on it
or pack your bags.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
- You have six months.

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
But I don't feel like
you think I'm serious.

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
- I know you're serious.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- But the question is,
are you?

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
You can call me a pushover.
You can call me weak--

08:31.000 --> 08:33.999
whatever you want,
but I am confident

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
that a ring is on its way.

08:35.999 --> 08:38.999
- Well, you're not gonna be
practically engaged forever.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
- And it will not be
on a string.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
- Har, har, har.

08:44.999 --> 08:47.999
- More sangria for the table,
anybody?

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
- Here's some more glasses
for ya.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.999
- This is the punishment
I get for, uh--

08:59.999 --> 09:00.999
getting a nose job.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
Lisa wants me to stay
behind the scenes

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
because, well, right now,
I'm not that pretty to look at.

09:04.999 --> 09:08.999
But, after this is all healed,
I'll be really good to look at.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.999
So that meeting--
not to pry into your business,

09:10.999 --> 09:13.999
but, from what I hear,
you're doing pretty good

09:13.999 --> 09:14.999
at the DJ-ing thing right now.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
Do you really need Kristen
to start f***ing up your thing,

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
man?

09:18.999 --> 09:20.999
- Well, Lisa's relationship
with Kristen hasn't always

09:20.999 --> 09:21.999
been the best thing,
and to be honest--

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
- I get it.
I get it, but, but, but--

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
But what she's doing
is affecting your job,

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
don't you think?

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
- Well, not yet.
I feel like Lisa was being

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
very lenient with me earlier
and gave me a warning

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
because that was,
you know, scary.

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
What if it does start
jeopardizing my job?

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
Then what?
Then I'm pretty much f***ed.

09:37.999 --> 09:40.999
- Mark my words, man.
She's a ticking time-bomb, man.

09:40.999 --> 09:41.999
- Yeah.
- And I'm just looking at you

09:41.999 --> 09:42.999
as you're a young guy
and that you're focusing

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
on your DJ career.
- Right.

09:44.999 --> 09:45.999
- You should be
wanted moving up.

09:45.999 --> 09:46.999
- Listen, I know
that we haven't, like,

09:46.999 --> 09:47.999
kicked it as much
in the last couple months,

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
but we've been in the same
group of friends

09:49.999 --> 09:50.999
for a while now.

09:50.999 --> 09:51.999
- No, you hang out
with my ex-girlfriend,

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
which kills me to death.
Trust me.

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
- Does it really?
- It does.

09:55.999 --> 09:57.999
Over the past six months
to a year,

09:57.999 --> 10:00.999
Carmen was the main girl
in my life.

10:00.999 --> 10:04.999
- You're 35 years old.
Stop with the partying.

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
Get focused!
Get on track!

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
Get your life together.

10:08.999 --> 10:09.999
- Carmen and I
are not dating anymore.

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
You know, we talk
once and while,

10:10.999 --> 10:13.999
but Carmen is friends
with Kristen,

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
which really pisses me off.

10:15.999 --> 10:18.999
Apparently a friend of mine
that asked her out.

10:18.999 --> 10:19.999
They've never hooked up,
have they?

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
Uh--

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
They may--

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
- Have kissed?
- Yeah.

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
- Oh, really?

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
- Yeah, that may have happened
in a hotel room.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
- Of course it bothers me
that Carmen's seeing other guys.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.999
She broke it off
before I kinda was ready to.

10:34.999 --> 10:37.000
There's been a few girls
in my life that are really good

10:37.999 --> 10:39.999
at twisting that knife
and she knows how to do it.

10:39.999 --> 10:41.999
- I'm staying out of it, man.

10:41.999 --> 10:42.999
I'm just gonna keep
my head down,

10:42.999 --> 10:43.999
work a little bit,
DJ tonight.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
Keep it cool, you know?
- All right.

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
- All right, mate.
I'll see you in a bit.

11:19.999 --> 11:22.999
- Hi.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
- Nothing.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.999
- Nope. No.
I swear to f***ing God.

11:30.999 --> 11:33.999
- No! No, no!
I did not.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.999
When you're telling a guy
information about a girl,

11:35.999 --> 11:37.999
you don't want to think,
oh, you're gonna have to go

11:37.999 --> 11:39.999
and ask him
about not telling her.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
Don't go running to your girl
five seconds after

11:41.999 --> 11:43.999
to go blabber your mouth
about it.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
That just goes ahead and makes
me look like an ass****.

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
- Oh, my God.
You're so annoying!

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
Then why am I talking
to you?

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
He's gonna text Carmen
everything.

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
You're listening
to what the f***

11:53.999 --> 11:54.999
Jax is talking to you.
You're a f***ing idiot,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.999
Kristen.

11:56.999 --> 11:59.999
You f***ing, f***ing dumbass.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
- Coming up...

12:01.999 --> 12:02.999
- You shouldn't have
texted Carmen right after

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
I talked to you.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
- Stop running your mouth about
things that are not relevant.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
- Stop coming here
to my place of work

12:07.999 --> 12:08.999
and f***ing sh** up for me.

12:16.999 --> 12:17.999
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

12:17.999 --> 12:19.999
- Enjoy your dinner.

12:19.999 --> 12:20.999
- You shouldn't have texted
Carmen right after I talked

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
to you.
- I can text Carmen.

12:22.999 --> 12:23.999
- Now Kristen's
sitting there with Carmen

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
and she's texting me
that you're telling Carmen

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
that I told you about
all these f***ing people.

12:27.999 --> 12:28.999
- But you did tell me
about this!

12:28.999 --> 12:29.999
- But why are you texting them?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
- But who cares?
Why do you care?

12:31.999 --> 12:34.999
- Because this is
what I have to deal with, Jax.

12:34.999 --> 12:35.999
Jax doesn't give a sh**
that he sold me out

12:35.999 --> 12:36.999
to my girlfriend.

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
I don't even think
he thought twice about it.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
He probably didn't even
think about it once.

12:40.999 --> 12:41.999
Jax has bro code.

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
His bro code is,
"f*** you, bros."

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
- James, what's the problem?
- Nothing. Nothing's a problem.

12:45.999 --> 12:46.999
All right, whatever.

12:56.999 --> 12:59.999
- Ooh, I heard
we have a birthday this weekend.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
- I was trying
to figure out this bill.

13:04.999 --> 13:05.999
You ready to go?

13:05.999 --> 13:06.999
- I've had a bit
of a long day, to be honest.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
- Give me a kiss?
- Do I have to?

13:08.999 --> 13:12.999
Mm.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
I had a long meeting
with the staff.

13:14.999 --> 13:17.999
Sandoval gave me a bit
of attitude.

13:17.999 --> 13:20.999
Not happy with him
at all right now.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
I have really been
frustrated with Tom Sandoval.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
I can't have him
just showing up

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
to pick up a shift
when he feels like it.

13:26.999 --> 13:29.999
If Tom's not committed,
there's no place for him here.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
- You want me
to talk to him?

13:31.999 --> 13:32.999
- No, not yet.

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
But I might need to--

13:33.999 --> 13:35.000
Call you in later.

13:35.999 --> 13:36.999
The heavy artillery.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
- The day you need me
to help you in here

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
is the day you retire.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
Okay, I'll leave this here
for Guillermo.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.999
- All right.
- Let's go.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
Wait for me, baby.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.999
- How are we enjoying it all?
- It's very good.

14:00.999 --> 14:01.999
- Hey.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- How's the lounge life?
- Loungey?

14:03.999 --> 14:06.999
- So apparently I'm scheduled
four times this week

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
because Jax decided
to get his nose fixed.

14:09.999 --> 14:10.999
- You're coming to my party.

14:10.999 --> 14:11.999
- Yes, yes.

14:11.999 --> 14:12.999
- Yeah.
- I'm coming.

14:12.999 --> 14:13.999
- Okay.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.999
You do know James
is DJ-ing, right?

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
- There's so many other DJs.

14:17.999 --> 14:20.999
I--dude, I'm not saying James--
James is a great DJ,

14:20.999 --> 14:22.999
but I'm--
- James, Shay and I are

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
still cool--we're still friends.
- I understand.

14:24.999 --> 14:25.999
- Him and Kristen
are not gonna f***ing

14:25.999 --> 14:26.999
stay together forever.
We all know that.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
- Is she coming
to your birthday party?

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
- She's not f***ing invited.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
- With Kristen, you have to
actually ban her

14:32.999 --> 14:36.999
from the premises.
Otherwise, she will show up.

14:36.999 --> 14:39.999
- It sucks because I want
to be able to have fun.

14:39.999 --> 14:42.999
And I don't want this f***ing,
like, wicked witch

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
f***ing hanging over sh**.

14:44.999 --> 14:47.999
- I just wish certain people
gave me personally a reason

14:47.999 --> 14:50.999
to not like them,
because when no one's given me

14:50.999 --> 14:51.999
a direct reason,
it makes it so much easier

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
for me to be nice, but--

14:53.000 --> 14:54.999
- I'm a direct reason.
He's a direct reason.

14:54.999 --> 14:58.999
Unfortunately, at some point,
Scheana's going to have

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
to acknowledge the fact
that Kristen has been

15:00.999 --> 15:04.999
a horrible person to me,

15:04.999 --> 15:06.999
who is supposed to be
her best friend.

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
- Can't we all just get along?

15:08.999 --> 15:09.999
- Ew.
- Ew.

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
- Get outta here.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.999
- How's it going?

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999
- God, what are you
doing here?

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
- Hi, lovely to see you too.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
- Listen, really quick.
Let me explain.

15:27.999 --> 15:29.999
James told me something
that I didn't want to hear.

15:29.999 --> 15:31.999
- I don't even know
all of that

15:31.999 --> 15:32.999
and I'm not getting involved
in all that.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
I feel like James is
just talking out of his ass

15:33.999 --> 15:34.999
right now.
- Okay, but, so--

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
He just told me.
That's why I was upset!

15:37.999 --> 15:40.000
- My relationship with James
hasn't been great for a while.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
The last f***ing thing I need
is for James to be running

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
to Jax and spilling my secrets.

15:44.999 --> 15:47.999
Keep your big mouth shut.
It's simple.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- I'm heated about my situation
with Carmen.

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999
I got mad.
- Learn to control

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
your f***ing anger, bro.
You're in your 30s.

15:52.999 --> 15:55.999
Like--
- So are you. So are you!

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
- And I control my anger.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
- You shouldn't have came
over here to start a fight!

15:59.999 --> 16:02.999
- I have a very different
approach to life these days.

16:02.999 --> 16:05.999
Getting fired--
it was kind of a relief.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
- I've had enough
of your bullsh**.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.999
You're fired
from Sur restaurant

16:08.999 --> 16:09.999
and it's done.

16:09.999 --> 16:12.999
- I've really been focusing
on my t-shirt line

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
and one of the major things
that I've worked on

16:15.999 --> 16:19.999
in therapy is to not act
like a psycho.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
f*** off!
No! f*** off!

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
Get the f*** out of my face.
- Ow!

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
- Stop it!
Who the f*** are you?

16:25.999 --> 16:28.999
I've learned that I don't
always have to react.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
Here we go.
- Hi.

16:30.999 --> 16:31.999
- So this is what's going on.
- What's up?

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
- So you're the one who is--

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
- You don't want to give me
a hug hello first?

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
- No, I really don't.
- Babe, please.

16:36.999 --> 16:37.999
- So you're the one who's
starting a whole lot of sh**.

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
- How are you coming here
with this when I've got

16:39.999 --> 16:40.999
to start DJ-ing right now.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.999
- Because you just started
a lot of sh**.

16:42.999 --> 16:43.999
- You're swaddling around.
- So you just started--

16:44.000 --> 16:45.999
- Are you drunk?
'Cause you look drunk.

16:45.999 --> 16:47.999
I've got to get my DJ equipment.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
I'm just getting a little
a panicky right now.

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
Lisa cannot find out
that Kristen is in the back

16:51.999 --> 16:52.999
of Sur causing problems.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
- Stop running your mouth
about things

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
that are not relevant.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.999
- Oh, my God!
You guys!

16:58.999 --> 16:59.999
I would rather lose
my relationship with Kristen

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
than ruin my DJ career.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
Girls come and go,
but dreams are

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
with you forever.

17:05.999 --> 17:06.999
- All this dilly-dallying
bullcrap--

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
I've got a job to do, okay?

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
And I'm not f***ing prepared
to lose it over

17:10.000 --> 17:11.999
my f***ing
girlfriend's bullsh**,

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
all right, Kristen?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
Stop coming here
to my place of work

17:14.999 --> 17:17.000
and f***ing sh** up for me!
- Buh-bye.

17:17.999 --> 17:19.999
- Sit there with your
little crazy smirk.

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
Sit there.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
I've got a f***ing job to do.

17:30.999 --> 17:34.999
- ♪ We're the ones who
never sleep ♪

17:34.999 --> 17:39.999
♪ Even with our hearts
on the offbeat ♪

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
- Thank you.
You take care.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.999
- My mother's turning 60.
She lives in Florida

17:48.999 --> 17:51.999
and she's never really
been to L.A.

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
and she's always wanted
to meet my friends.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
- Oh, look at you!
You feeling okay?

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
Hi!

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
Let me give you
the little tour.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
- Ah, it's very cool.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
- Of course it would be amazing
to show my mom

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
around my Beverly Hills mansion.

18:09.999 --> 18:11.999
It's, like, my closet.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
But, you know, even if I had
all that,

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
I wouldn't live like that.
It's just not me.

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
Do you want a glass of wine?

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
- Did you take this
or was this a gift?

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
- Lisa may or may not know
that I have this bottle.

18:21.999 --> 18:23.999
- Old habits don't die.

18:23.999 --> 18:24.999
- That's another thing
I was telling my friends

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
that the only person
who calls me Jason is my mom,

18:26.999 --> 18:27.999
my dad, and my sister.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.999
I know you hate the name Jax
and I told my friends,

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
"Don't call me Jax
in front of my mother.

18:31.999 --> 18:32.999
She does not like that."

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
- Well, they can call you,
I just won't--

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
I can't get used to it.

18:35.999 --> 18:38.999
- My stage name/modeling name
has been Jax Taylor.

18:38.999 --> 18:41.999
For her to call me Jax
would be just weird.

18:41.999 --> 18:42.999
So you're here.

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
This is the big
birthday weekend.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
The big 6-0.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
I mean--
I know.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.000
- So we have
a really busy schedule,

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
so we are gonna go
to Villa Blanca.

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
- Mm-hmm.
- We're gonna have lunch

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
with Scheana's mom, Erika.
- Oh, yeah.

18:56.999 --> 18:58.999
- She's turning 50
on the same day

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
that you're turning 60
and Scheana's turning 30--

19:00.999 --> 19:01.999
all in the same day,
isn't that crazy?

19:01.999 --> 19:04.000
- Yeah, that is.
- Then, after that,

19:04.999 --> 19:06.000
we have the party.
- Oh, great.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
So how are you doing?
Everything's doing okay?

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
- I'm great, I mean,
as far as, you know, work.

19:10.999 --> 19:15.999
As far as, you know, girls--
- Just take a break.

19:15.999 --> 19:16.999
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Take a break.

19:16.999 --> 19:17.999
- I think I just need
to take a break.

19:17.999 --> 19:19.999
- Stop, please!
- I know.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
- Stop, okay?
- I know, I know.

19:21.999 --> 19:22.999
- I can't wait to meet
the young woman

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
that actually
you fall in love with her,

19:24.999 --> 19:28.999
and it's going to happen
if you just stop for a while

19:28.999 --> 19:30.000
and let it happen.

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
You need to
understand who you are

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
and why you're like that,
and I hate to say it.

19:35.999 --> 19:36.999
- That's so true.
It's so true.

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
- Was that seaside sign--
is that from my house?

19:38.999 --> 19:40.999
- No--

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
There is some things
in this house

19:41.999 --> 19:42.999
that may be yours
that I took.

19:44.999 --> 19:48.999
All the silverware
is from Sur.

19:48.999 --> 19:50.999
- I take it they're not gifts
from Lisa.

19:50.999 --> 19:51.999
- Well, they were gifts.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
She just doesn't know
that I have the gifts.

19:55.999 --> 19:56.999
- Coming up...

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
- Sounds cheesy, but I'm ready.
- Really?

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
- I actually want to propose.

20:10.999 --> 20:12.999
- ♪ Let's get lost ♪

20:20.999 --> 20:23.999
- Hi.
- Yo.

20:23.999 --> 20:27.999
- Brought you flowers
for being rude to you yesterday.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.999
I'm sorry.

20:29.999 --> 20:30.999
- Are you?

20:30.999 --> 20:33.999
- Yeah, I felt bad about it.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.999
- Which part?

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
- About telling you to f*** off
and calling you names

20:38.999 --> 20:41.999
when I got angry at you.

20:41.999 --> 20:43.999
- This is how it always goes
with James.

20:43.999 --> 20:44.999
Jekyll and f***ing Hyde.

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
I never know if he's
gonna be super sweet

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
or a total psycho.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.999
Why is it your business
to tell Carmen's business.

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
Jax isn't your friend, so if
you're gonna lie to someone--

20:52.999 --> 20:55.999
- Yeah, I know, but he's not
not my friend.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
It honestly just drives
her crazy that I'm hanging

20:57.999 --> 20:58.999
around all her old friends.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.999
I think she's got, you know,
a little bit of a case

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
of fomo--
she has "fear of missing out."

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
Last year at Scheana'a
birthday party,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.999
I went into thinking
I was gonna DJ.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
It was gonna be a great night
and next thing you know,

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
me and Tom were ripping
each other's faces off.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
Don't get smart with me.

21:11.999 --> 21:12.999
Don't f***ing threaten
when you're all--

21:12.999 --> 21:13.999
- Whoa! Whoa!

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
- Stop it!
- Whoever started this sh**,

21:15.999 --> 21:16.999
get the f*** out!

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
- That wasn't my fault.

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999
- That reflecting
onto this year is

21:20.000 --> 21:21.999
the complete opposite
of what I want to happen.

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
I want to go there
and have a great night

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
with everybody and have fun
with everyone.

21:24.999 --> 21:25.999
- Awesome.

21:25.999 --> 21:28.999
- If we're not gonna fight
and everything's gonna be fine.

21:28.999 --> 21:31.999
Can I not say that?

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
- No, because this is
what you do.

21:32.999 --> 21:33.999
You project negative energy.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.999
If you don't want me
to come to Scheana's birthday

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
with you, then I'm not
gonna come to Scheana's birthday

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
with you.
It's that simple.

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
- Kristen,
I don't not want that,

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
but I also don't want
to show up with you

21:41.999 --> 21:42.999
and have it go to sh** again.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
- I want to be with you.

21:44.999 --> 21:45.999
I don't want to be
with anyone else.

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
I don't think about dating.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
I love you,
but then I'm like,

21:48.999 --> 21:49.999
"Is this healthy for me?"

21:49.999 --> 21:52.999
f***.

21:52.999 --> 21:55.999
- I just feel like
I kind of need to figure it out

21:55.999 --> 21:57.999
day by day.

21:57.999 --> 22:02.999
- Let's have a good night, then.
Okay?

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
- Okay.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
- Very pretty.

22:07.999 --> 22:10.999
Okay, I just want a hug then.
Come here.

22:10.999 --> 22:13.999
Mm.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.999
- You smell like food.
- Do I?

22:23.999 --> 22:24.999
- Look at Villa Blanca.

22:24.999 --> 22:27.999
- I know!
You're finally here.

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
- Finally!
- So nice to meet you.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
- Oh, you too.

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
Good, how are you?
- Good.

22:31.999 --> 22:32.999
- And thanks for taking care
of the big boy.

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
- Hi.
- Hi!

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
- Of course!
- So nice to meet you finally.

22:35.999 --> 22:37.999
- You too. Congratulations
for your wedding.

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you so much.

22:39.999 --> 22:41.999
I can't offer any information
about Jax's life in L.A.

22:41.999 --> 22:44.999
to his mom,
because who knows how many lies

22:44.999 --> 22:47.999
he's told his mom?
I'm like, "Does she really know

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
where you live?"

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
- I'm really nervous.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
- I'll tell you stories
that you don't know about.

22:52.999 --> 22:54.999
- Oh, my gosh.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.999
I'm sweating bullets,
I'm not gonna lie right now.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.999
- Oh, no!
- Hi!

23:03.999 --> 23:06.999
- This is my mother, finally.
- This is the woman.

23:06.999 --> 23:07.999
- This is the woman
who gave--

23:07.999 --> 23:09.000
- We have much to talk about.

23:09.999 --> 23:10.999
I'm gonna take a seat.
- Okay.

23:10.999 --> 23:11.999
- Hello, Erika,
how are you?

23:11.999 --> 23:13.000
- Hi, nice to see you.

23:13.999 --> 23:14.999
- Hi, darling.

23:14.999 --> 23:16.999
- I don't do fake kisses.
I do full-on hugs.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
- Oh, my God.

23:18.999 --> 23:19.999
- Oh, I'm gonna have some fun.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
What was he like
as a child?

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
Was he as bad as he is now?

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
- Yes.

23:25.999 --> 23:26.999
- Yes.

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
- Okay, so I have to ask.

23:27.999 --> 23:30.999
How many of the girlfriends
have you met?

23:30.999 --> 23:33.999
There's Carter.
There's Kentucky.

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
- She's visiting on Sunday.

23:34.999 --> 23:37.999
I'm currently talking
to a girl named Brittany.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.999
She's from a small town
in Kentucky.

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
- Kentucky,
she's not moving in, right?

23:41.999 --> 23:42.999
- She's not moving in.
I promise.

23:42.999 --> 23:43.999
I'm not doing that anymore.

23:43.999 --> 23:44.999
- No, he just gives them
spare keys.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.999
Oh.

23:46.999 --> 23:47.999
- I'm not getting any younger.

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
I would like to settle down
at some point,

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
but, you know, I still
have that wandering eye

23:50.999 --> 23:53.999
and I still always think
there's always something

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
better out there.
So, we'll see.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.999
- She did not like Stassi.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
- I loved Stassi
in the beginning.

23:58.999 --> 24:01.999
As time went on, I just saw
the personality change.

24:01.999 --> 24:04.999
Not that this is an angel,
by any means.

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
- No.
- Oh, wow, way to go, Mommy.

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
- He's like the puppy
that pees on the carpet

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
that you can't get mad at.

24:09.999 --> 24:10.999
- All the time.
You can't.

24:10.999 --> 24:11.999
- So he's always
been that way, though?

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
- Always.
- Yeah.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
- Always.
- Ah.

24:14.999 --> 24:15.999
- Always, always, always.

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
When my daughter was ten,
her aunt got her

24:17.999 --> 24:20.999
a beautiful, beautiful cross.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.999
Jason had a little girlfriend
and it was her birthday,

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
so he stole his sister's cross.

24:25.999 --> 24:26.999
- Oh, really?

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
- You know he still does that?
- No, I don't.

24:29.999 --> 24:32.000
- Yeah, he took Carmen's glasses
from his apartment,

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
wrapped them and gave them
to Katie for her birthday

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
a few months ago.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
- And then Carmen
saw them on Instagram.

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
I used to forge
my mom's signature

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
on all my tests
and I used to fake

24:42.000 --> 24:44.999
and copy my report cards
and change the grades.

24:44.999 --> 24:47.999
But I did feel bad.
Sorry, Mom.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- What's the naughtiest thing
he ever did?

24:50.999 --> 24:53.999
- Remember when you came in
with the bus driver?

24:53.999 --> 24:56.999
And she was crying--
Beautiful blonde woman.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
Here's my 12-year-old's
first experience

24:58.999 --> 24:59.999
with hitting on
an older woman.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.999
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

25:02.999 --> 25:03.999
- She comes knocking
at the door

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
and she goes, "I came down
on the bus, I'm standing there,

25:05.999 --> 25:08.999
and your son takes her
in a dip

25:08.999 --> 25:11.999
and lays one right on her lips."

25:12.999 --> 25:15.999
- I love your mother,
you know what?

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
I imagined Jax's mother
to be devoid of any feelings.

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
Kind of brought him up
really to not give a damn

25:21.000 --> 25:23.999
about anybody or anything,
and there's this woman

25:23.999 --> 25:26.999
who's just so funny
and she's so sweet,

25:26.999 --> 25:29.999
but she's totally
got Jax's number.

25:29.999 --> 25:32.999
The only good qualities you have
I think you clearly get

25:32.999 --> 25:33.999
from your mother.

25:33.999 --> 25:36.999
- He's nice to 85%
of the customers.

25:36.999 --> 25:38.999
- 85% of the--
- And dating the other 20.

25:38.999 --> 25:40.999
- Exactly.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.999
- Don't you love us
getting together.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.999
Thank you, dude.

25:49.999 --> 25:52.999
- Oh, wait.
- Is this it?

25:52.999 --> 25:53.999
- Hello.
- How are you?

25:53.999 --> 25:55.999
- How are you guys doing?
- Good.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
Good.

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
- Good.
- A little nervous.

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
- Yeah?
- A little nervous.

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
- Are you the one
getting the perm today?

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
- Yeah, there's a decade party
tonight.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.999
- All right.
- I'm going as '70s.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
- You're really gonna do this?
- I've put a lot of thought

26:06.999 --> 26:10.999
into this and uh,
yeah, I'm getting a perm.

26:10.999 --> 26:13.999
- A perm is a commitment,
hence the name "perm."

26:13.999 --> 26:14.999
I'm proud of him.

26:14.999 --> 26:17.999
I just think that he might be
committing to the wrong thing.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
- The way I look at it,
it's like a symbolic gesture.

26:19.999 --> 26:20.999
You don't want to be the guy
who has a perm

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
and doesn't have
his sh** together, right?

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
I've unofficially declared
this the year of Tom,

26:25.999 --> 26:28.999
and I decided I'm gonna undergo
a metamorphosis.

26:28.999 --> 26:31.999
I exorcised all of
my inner douche last year.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
I was just kind of
a schmuck of a boyfriend.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
I cheated on Katie.

26:35.999 --> 26:38.999
I actually did, like,
make out with that girl.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.999
And, uh, I gave her
a ring on a string.

26:41.999 --> 26:42.999
- Putting a ring on a string.

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
- No, but don't think
too much about it.

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
- It's not really what a girl
pushing 30 wants to hear.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.999
- This is my year
of redemption.

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
If I could set
my hair straight,

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
maybe I can set my life
straight.

26:50.999 --> 26:53.999
Even though the hair is curly.

26:53.999 --> 26:54.999
You get what I'm trying
to say, right?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.999
The good news is, is that,
for the first time,

26:57.999 --> 27:01.999
it sounds cheesy,
but I'm ready.

27:01.999 --> 27:04.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.999
Like, I actually wanna propose.

27:07.999 --> 27:08.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:10.999 --> 27:13.999
- I've never heard Schwartz
actually say this

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
out loud.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.999
- Has a guy ever come in here
and got a perm before me?

27:17.999 --> 27:18.999
- Um, not since I've been here.

27:18.999 --> 27:21.999
- Nice.
I'm like a perm pioneer.

27:21.999 --> 27:24.999
- All right, perfect.
Well, come on over.

27:24.999 --> 27:25.999
It looks good.
- Yeah?

27:25.999 --> 27:27.999
- Yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.999
Of course, it's not styled
fully yet.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
- Okay, all right, so--
okay, yeah.

27:31.999 --> 27:32.999
Hoo-hoo!
Yeah it's just, like, wavy.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
- Looking good, dude.

27:34.999 --> 27:36.999
- It's not as permy
as I wanted it to be,

27:36.999 --> 27:38.999
but I think this is better.
I think it's more realistic.

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
It's actually perfect.
- Dude, it looks good.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.999
- And it's got zest.
- It does.

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
- It's got pizazz.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.000
- You're never gonna
work again in this town.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
But it looks good.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
- Coming up...

27:49.999 --> 27:50.999
- Would you get me a drink?
- You don't need liquor.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
- You're not gonna tell me sh**
when I'm DJ-ing.

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
- Tom and Tom
look like two undercover,

28:20.999 --> 28:23.999
slightly rapey-looking cops
from the '70s

28:23.999 --> 28:26.999
and then we've got Ariana,
who looks like she should be

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
at the factory
with Andy Warhol.

28:28.999 --> 28:32.999
I modeled my costume
after Cher of "Clueless."

28:32.999 --> 28:35.999
We are definitely
the most awesome foursome

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
in the history of time.

28:40.999 --> 28:45.999
- When I get a costume, it's
a head-to-toe transformation.

28:45.999 --> 28:48.999
I give myself a name,
a backstory--

28:49.000 --> 28:54.999
and Chip Harley
is damn near invincible.

28:54.999 --> 28:55.999
What's up, guys?

28:59.999 --> 29:02.999
- I'm dressed as Danny Zuko.

29:02.999 --> 29:03.999
My mom's Audrey Hepburn
tonight,

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
"Breakfast at Tiffany's."

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
Carmen said she didn't want
to come to the party,

29:07.999 --> 29:10.999
so I just went one name down
on my contact list.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
Carter--invited her.

29:12.999 --> 29:13.999
- Oh, my God.
Peter!

29:13.999 --> 29:16.999
- Hey-o!
- Jax, by the way.

29:16.999 --> 29:17.999
- I'm Sarah, hi.
- This is Sarah.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
- Nice to meet you.

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
- I think we all have
an inner hair metal,

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
glam rocker inside of us
and I'm letting it out.

29:24.999 --> 29:26.999
- Dude!
This is awesome.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.999
- Is your mom here?
- Yeah, she's right here.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.999
Mom, Tom.
- Hey!

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
- This is awesome.
- Thank you.

29:34.999 --> 29:35.999
- My mom's 60.
It's her 60th birthday.

29:35.999 --> 29:36.999
- What?
- Yeah.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you very much.

29:38.999 --> 29:39.999
- Where's your daughter?

29:39.999 --> 29:45.999
- Hi!

29:45.999 --> 29:49.999
Growing up, I was obsessed
with Madonna.

29:49.999 --> 29:53.999
So, I know I'm married, but
I can still be like a virgin.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- Happy birthday, mama.
You look amazing!

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
Holy sh**.

29:57.999 --> 30:00.999
- You guys look amazing.
- And you look so good.

30:02.999 --> 30:03.999
- This is f***ing awesome.

30:03.999 --> 30:06.999
All of my friends
totally nailed their looks,

30:06.999 --> 30:09.000
and everyone looks really hot.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
- Happy birthday!
- Hey! I love it.

30:11.999 --> 30:13.999
- Oh, my God.
You look so cute.

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
- Gina's definitely not stressed
about turning 30

30:15.999 --> 30:18.999
'cause she knows that 30
is sexy.

30:18.999 --> 30:21.999
And what does she care anyway?
She's already married.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
I mean--

30:28.999 --> 30:31.999
- Here goes nothing!

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
- Clearly, I was not
technically invited,

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
but I know that Scheana,
really deep down,

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
wants me at her birthday party.

30:39.999 --> 30:40.999
- Oh, my God.

30:48.999 --> 30:49.999
- Oh, Kristen
must have misheard.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
She thought it was
a cleavage party,

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
not a costume party.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
- Yeah.

31:11.999 --> 31:13.000
- I didn't want
to do a decades costume.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
I mean, I lived the '70s.
I can't remember the '80s,

31:15.999 --> 31:18.999
so I think I'll just go
as Lisa Vanderpump.

31:18.999 --> 31:19.999
Oh, my God.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- The question is,
"Are you gonna have a drink?"

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
- I've had two already.

31:28.999 --> 31:32.999
I've dressed up as a '60s,
modern day, Woodstock rock star.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
I styled it myself.
I cut it myself.

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
Yet again, I'm the guy
with the best hair

31:36.999 --> 31:37.999
at the party.

31:37.999 --> 31:40.999
Sorry, Tom.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
- Who's running the ship then?

31:43.999 --> 31:44.999
- Huh?

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
- Who's running the ship?

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- Hello--
happy birthday, darling.

31:49.999 --> 31:50.999
- See?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.999
- I'm not surprised to see
Scheana dressed as Madonna.

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
- Scheana and Shay wouldn't go
as Sonny and Cher

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
or John and Yoko because
Scheana is always the star

32:01.999 --> 32:04.999
in that relationship
and Shay very much

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
is kind of laid back
in the background.

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
- Where is my husband?
Can you--can someone find him

32:08.999 --> 32:13.999
for me, please?

32:13.999 --> 32:16.999
Where the f*** is he?
I don't know.

32:28.999 --> 32:30.999
- Hi, hi!

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- One.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
I swear.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
- A beer?
You don't need liquor.

32:40.999 --> 32:41.999
A beer?

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
- Yeah, sure.
Whatever.

32:46.999 --> 32:47.999
If there's one thing I hate,
it's someone telling me

32:48.000 --> 32:50.999
that I'm doing something
when I haven't even done it yet.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
You already think I'm drunk?
f***.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
I'm gonna go get f***ing
sh**-faced.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
You're not gonna tell me sh**
when I'm DJ-ing, okay.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
- Okay.
All right.

33:06.999 --> 33:09.999
- Hey.
- Hey?

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- I already ordered it for him.
- What did you get him? No.

33:13.999 --> 33:14.999
He needs a beer.
- Vodka and ginger.

33:14.999 --> 33:15.999
- No.

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
- Thank you.
- Uh, well, he asked me for one,

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
so I got him one.
- He just told me to get him

33:21.999 --> 33:22.999
a beer.
I said, "How many have you had?"

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
He said, "One."

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
- All right, well you
caught us red-handed, then.

33:26.999 --> 33:27.999
- I'm not his mom.
- Hey--

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
- Give him that and I'm not
gonna give him a beer.

33:29.999 --> 33:32.000
James is on his way
to being a drunken ass****.

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
Kristen, where are you,
darling?

33:36.999 --> 33:38.999
- Coming up...

33:38.999 --> 33:39.999
- I may or may not have
a fake friend.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.999
- Scheana?

33:58.999 --> 34:02.999
- Whoo!

34:02.999 --> 34:03.999
Yeah!

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
- Kristen, get outta here.

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
What the f***, man.
Get a life.

34:13.999 --> 34:15.999
- What's up, guys?

34:15.999 --> 34:16.999
- Are you gonna talk to Tom?

34:16.999 --> 34:17.999
- How's it going tonight?

34:17.999 --> 34:19.999
- You, I got a bone
to pick with you.

34:19.999 --> 34:20.999
- I know, I know.

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
- Don't ever disrespect
my wife.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- All right.
- Ever, okay?

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
- Okay.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.999
- Otherwise,
you might regret it.

34:28.999 --> 34:30.999
- Me and Lisa
already talked about this.

34:30.999 --> 34:34.999
And now she's decided
to sic her husband on me.

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
Some of that British gangster
really comes through.

34:36.999 --> 34:38.000
- I apologized.

34:38.999 --> 34:39.999
- It's about respect.

34:39.999 --> 34:41.999
- You can never do that to her.

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
- The best thing to do
is just sort of ride it out

34:43.999 --> 34:46.999
and eventually, they'll move on
to somebody else.

34:46.999 --> 34:47.999
- Anyway, we'll talk later--
go and have a good time.

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
- All right, you guys too.

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
- I get this one.

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
- Whoo!

35:07.999 --> 35:11.999
- I've already had a wedding.
I'm now turning 30.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
This is, like, my last
opportunity to really be

35:13.999 --> 35:17.999
the center of attention
for a while.

35:22.999 --> 35:26.999
- You, my dear, might be in
a little bit of trouble with me.

35:26.999 --> 35:29.999
- It's a very interesting story
that you heard.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
- Okay, would you like
to tell me your version?

35:31.999 --> 35:32.999
- Yeah, absolutely.

35:32.999 --> 35:34.999
- I don't even work
for Lisa anymore

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
and she'll still find something
to reprimand me about.

35:37.999 --> 35:39.999
- Do you admit
there was a problem?

35:39.999 --> 35:42.999
- He was very aggressive
and upset that day.

35:42.999 --> 35:44.999
- Yeah, but you came
to his workplace.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
- He asked me to come.

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
- I'm asking
for the impossible.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
I'm asking
for taking responsibility.

35:50.999 --> 35:52.999
but it's Kristen I'm asking,
so clearly,

35:52.999 --> 35:53.999
it's never gonna happen.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
- I think it's really unfair
for you to point

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
the blame on me.

35:57.999 --> 35:58.999
I think
that's really judgmental

35:58.999 --> 36:00.999
and really unfair.

36:00.999 --> 36:02.999
I love being at Pump,
but if it's gonna be an issue,

36:02.999 --> 36:05.999
I could spend $15
on a glass of wine

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
in many other bars in L.A.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
- Well,
maybe that's a good idea...

36:09.999 --> 36:10.999
- No.
- 'Cause he's in danger

36:10.999 --> 36:11.999
of losing his job.

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
- But that's his--
it's his temper problem,

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
not mine.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
- She lost her own job--
she did an excellent job

36:17.999 --> 36:18.999
at that,
but now she wants

36:18.999 --> 36:20.999
to lose James' job as well.

36:20.999 --> 36:23.999
I mean, are there no bounds
to her stupidity?

36:23.999 --> 36:25.999
- The best scenario
for me right now

36:25.999 --> 36:28.999
is for you not to be around him
when he's working.

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
- Okay.

36:30.999 --> 36:31.999
It's good to see you.
You look lovely.

36:31.999 --> 36:32.999
Kiss?

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
- I got you some wine.
- Thank you.

36:50.999 --> 36:51.999
- You having a good time?

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
- I am, thank you.

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
- I mean, uh, honestly,

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
you're, like,
the hit of the party.

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
- Aw.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.999
- You're having a great time?
You having a good time?

37:01.999 --> 37:04.999
- Jason, I'm having--

37:04.999 --> 37:06.999
I--I--I--
This has been--

37:06.999 --> 37:07.999
- This is fun, right?

37:07.999 --> 37:10.999
- It has been unreal.

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
You have such nice people
in your life.

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- I mean, my friends
are great right?

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
Tom, Tom,
are like my brothers.

37:16.999 --> 37:17.999
They're my blood
and when I do get married,

37:17.999 --> 37:21.999
if that day ever comes,
those two are like my blood

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
and I would do anything
in the world for them.

37:24.999 --> 37:25.999
- Are you feeling all right,
though?

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
- Yeah, yeah, I mean,
the medication is helping.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.999
- Hey, will you leave
the wig on for later?

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
- Yeah, it's my hair.

37:38.999 --> 37:40.999
It's a crimper.

37:40.999 --> 37:44.999
I've seen Kristen several times
over the past few months

37:44.999 --> 37:48.999
and she's definitely
more pleasant to be around.

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
I know I didn't, like,
specifically invite you.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
I know James invited you.

37:52.999 --> 37:53.999
- That's clearly why I'm not.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.999
- I still have
a f***ing soft spot

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
for Kristen.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
There's something about her
that I just can't hate.

38:00.999 --> 38:01.999
Well, I like this.

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
- I'm post-millennial.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
- Look at this view.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- Oh, my God, sexy.
Look at the Sunset Strip.

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
- I've never been up here.
- No, lookit, you can--

38:12.999 --> 38:15.999
Our apartment's
right over there.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
You're so committed.

38:17.999 --> 38:18.999
- Oh, sh**.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
- Tom, take
the rollerskates off.

38:20.999 --> 38:21.999
- Champ!
- I know, I know.

38:21.999 --> 38:22.999
- He's so committed.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999
- What a f***ing night.

38:26.999 --> 38:29.999
- I don't know.
- Not even in a costume.

38:29.999 --> 38:30.999
- Something's telling me
I may or may not

38:30.999 --> 38:33.999
have a fake friend.

38:36.999 --> 38:37.999
- When she says things like,

38:37.999 --> 38:39.999
"Well, she's never done
anything to me,"

38:39.999 --> 38:42.999
I'm like, "When did I
not become important?"

38:42.999 --> 38:45.999
- I just wish certain people
gave me personally a reason

38:45.999 --> 38:48.999
to not like them,
because when no one's given me

38:48.999 --> 38:50.999
a direct reason,
it makes it so much easier

38:50.999 --> 38:51.999
for me to be nice.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.999
- I'm a direct reason.
- He's a direct reason.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.999
- After what transpired
a year ago

38:55.999 --> 38:59.999
and the concerted effort
that was made.

38:59.999 --> 39:04.999
Kristen wanted me
to get hit by planes, trains.

39:04.999 --> 39:06.000
She wanted me to die.

39:06.999 --> 39:09.999
- I do wish she would
get hit by a Mack Truck

39:09.999 --> 39:11.999
or something.

39:11.999 --> 39:13.999
- And it absolutely
should not be okay

39:13.999 --> 39:15.999
with my best friend, Scheana.

39:15.999 --> 39:17.999
I have a really amazing life
and I don't have room

39:17.999 --> 39:20.999
in my life
for f***ing bullsh**.

39:20.999 --> 39:23.999
And if I stand alone in that,
I stand alone.

39:23.999 --> 39:28.999
- I can tell you
that whatever you do,

39:28.999 --> 39:30.999
I'm with you 100%.

39:30.999 --> 39:33.999
You are my f***ing world.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.999
You know, when like,
sh** gets f***ing weird?

39:35.999 --> 39:37.999
I'll just look at you,
you can look at me,

39:37.999 --> 39:41.999
and we could just
take a vacation.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
By the way.
- Yeah?

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
So do you.

39:52.999 --> 39:53.999
- Coming up...

39:53.999 --> 39:54.999
- Oh, my God--
James!

39:54.999 --> 39:55.999
- James, James--
no, no, James.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
- Holy sh**!

39:57.999 --> 39:58.999
- What?

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
- That was a beautiful
f***ing time tonight.

40:10.999 --> 40:12.999
I had a blast.
- It was great.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
- Yeah!

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Ask and you shall receive.
- I knew it!

40:22.999 --> 40:25.999
- Mm.
I don't know if I can.

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
- Oh, my God.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
- James, James, James.
- Oh, my God--James.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
- James, James--
no, no, James.

40:31.999 --> 40:32.999
- Holy sh**, dude.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
- What?
- That was f***in'--

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
That was a waterfall!

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
No, no, no--James!

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
- Watching James
with this bottle of fireball

40:40.999 --> 40:43.999
is like watching
the money shot in a porno.

40:43.999 --> 40:46.999
I mean, it's just like,
tongue out, eyes closed--

40:46.999 --> 40:48.999
Splashing
all over his face.

40:48.999 --> 40:50.999
- Holy sh**!

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
- Oi, I'm from the '60s!

40:53.000 --> 40:55.999
- Oh, my God.
- The '60s!

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
That was, like, really good.
You were like--

40:56.999 --> 40:59.999
- James clearly has had--

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
I didn't even know
he had that much to drink,

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
but he's, like--
he's over the edge--I'm sorry.

41:02.999 --> 41:03.999
- He's definitely having fun.

41:03.999 --> 41:06.999
- That was so crazy, guys!

41:06.999 --> 41:07.999
- I don't feel like
I can calm him down.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.999
I feel like if I try
to say something to him,

41:09.999 --> 41:10.999
he's gonna bark at me.

41:10.999 --> 41:11.999
- Kristen, come sit with me.

41:11.999 --> 41:14.999
- f***ing embarrassing.

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
I'm over this sh**.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.999
I think you should just
kind of chill a little bit.

41:17.999 --> 41:20.999
None of us need to get
too turnt right now, you know?

41:20.999 --> 41:21.999
I'm just saying--

41:21.999 --> 41:24.999
- Listen, I'm just sick
of making you upset, Kristen.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
Kristen definitely drives me
to drink.

41:26.999 --> 41:29.999
She just makes me feel, like,
unwanted, insecure--

41:29.999 --> 41:32.999
My next plan is to just have
the time of my night.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.999
- Jamesy, baby!
No more--James.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- You are the most
beautiful girl I've ever

41:42.999 --> 41:45.000
laid eyes on.

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
- James is right up
in Jenna's face

41:47.999 --> 41:49.999
whispering God knows what.

41:49.999 --> 41:50.999
Yeah--
it bothers me.

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
- It's a weird, f***ed up love
that I still have for you.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
And if we made music
together, okay,

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
it's gonna seriously
cause a bridge.

42:01.999 --> 42:04.000
- I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
DJ Lightweight over here
is f***ing hammered.

42:06.999 --> 42:08.999
I don't think this is
gonna end well.

42:08.999 --> 42:10.999
But the last thing Chip Harley's
ever gonna let happen

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
is a party wind down.

42:12.999 --> 42:15.999
Oh!

42:15.999 --> 42:17.999
- You're joking!
- What?

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
- Whoo!

42:27.999 --> 42:29.999
- Next time,
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- Hello, Lala.
- Hi, Lisa.

42:31.999 --> 42:32.999
- How many training sessions
have you done?

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
- Three.

42:33.999 --> 42:34.999
- Bring in a couple
of new people.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.999
Keeps the old employees
on their toes.

42:36.999 --> 42:37.999
People are replaceable.

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
- No one's punched me
in the face

42:38.999 --> 42:40.000
or called me a bitch yet.

42:40.999 --> 42:41.000
- Well, that's good.

42:41.999 --> 42:42.999
- Hi.
- Hello.

42:42.999 --> 42:43.999
- Welcome to L.A.

42:43.999 --> 42:44.999
- It's just nice
to meet somebody

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
that has no real idea
about my past.

42:46.999 --> 42:47.999
- Are you moving in?
- Do you have a set

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
of spare keys?

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
- Oh, my God.

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
- James had an Uber
from his house to Jenna's house.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
That is what we're calling
"The Smoking Gun Uber."

42:54.999 --> 42:56.999
- We were just hanging out.
- You're a f***ing liar.

42:56.999 --> 42:57.999
You don't want to see
the Uber receipt

42:57.999 --> 42:58.999
from your e-mail?

42:58.999 --> 42:59.999
- Oh, damn it.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- Kristen called me
a rude bitch.

43:01.999 --> 43:04.999
- I would never be friends
with a person like that.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
- Ariana's clearly saying,
"I don't want you f***ing

43:06.000 --> 43:07.999
hanging out with Kristen."

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
It's so hard to be friends
with you.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- They're the one's putting
you in this position, not me.

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
- I just can't be your friend.

43:12.999 --> 43:13.999
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules,"
