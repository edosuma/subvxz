WEBVTT

00:00.214 --> 00:03.355
Over the past decade,
the partnership between the FBI

00:03.455 --> 00:06.130
and the Jeffersonian
Institution's Forensic Division

00:06.230 --> 00:09.999
has resulted
in over 250 murder convictions,

00:10.034 --> 00:12.435
making it one of the most
successful collaborations

00:12.470 --> 00:14.437
in law enforcement history.

00:14.472 --> 00:16.038
In order to better understand

00:16.074 --> 00:17.707
the partnership
and how it works,

00:17.742 --> 00:19.542
I was granted permission
to follow the team

00:19.577 --> 00:22.344
throughout the course
of a murder investigation.

00:22.380 --> 00:25.448
I'm Alex Duffy, and this is
<i>America in Profile.</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:51.008 --> 00:54.143
So I was out tending to
a leachate leak out in cell six

00:54.178 --> 00:56.679
when I get this feeling
like somebody's watching me.

00:56.714 --> 00:58.481
So I start looking
around, right?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.483
But there's nobody there,
it's just a bunch of trash.

01:00.518 --> 01:04.986
So finally I see this moldy head
of cabbage sitting there,

01:05.022 --> 01:06.956
and I swear it's staring at me.

01:06.991 --> 01:08.924
<i>So I hop down</i>
<i>out of my excavator,</i>

01:08.960 --> 01:10.459
<i>make my way</i>
<i>over to the cabbage.</i>

01:10.495 --> 01:12.428
And as I'm getting closer,

01:12.463 --> 01:13.996
I noticed this freaking
thing has teeth.

01:14.031 --> 01:15.331
And I mean, like, a lot of them.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.766
And that's when
I'm saying to myself,

01:16.801 --> 01:19.635
"Whoa, Gary,
this ain't no cabbage.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.070
This is a person."

01:21.105 --> 01:23.639
<i>So I called</i>
<i>my supervisor, Dennis,</i>

01:23.674 --> 01:25.474
<i>and he calls the police,</i>
<i>and next thing I know,</i>

01:25.510 --> 01:28.043
<i>there's a guy out here</i>
<i>asking all these questions,</i>

01:28.079 --> 01:29.645
<i>while this real</i>
<i>brainy-looking lady</i>

01:29.680 --> 01:31.514
<i>was poking around</i>
<i>at the dead body.</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:34.049
Now, I assumed they was cops,
but by the way they was arguing,

01:34.085 --> 01:36.619
I figured they must be married.

01:36.654 --> 01:39.588
Booth and I were not arguing
at the scene-scene of the crime.

01:39.624 --> 01:41.490
I mean, we were having
a healthy debate

01:41.526 --> 01:43.025
between a husband and wife.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.460
Right, sometimes our
debates are so "healthy,"

01:44.495 --> 01:47.229
I end up sleeping
on the couch.

01:47.265 --> 01:48.564
It's true.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.835
<i> My name is</i>
<i>Dr. Temperance Brennan,</i>

01:52.870 --> 01:54.804
<i>and I am a forensic</i>
<i>anthropologist</i>

01:54.839 --> 01:57.239
<i>with the Jeffersonian</i>
<i>Institution.</i>

01:57.275 --> 01:59.041
<i>And my name is Seeley Booth,</i>

01:59.076 --> 02:01.076
<i>and I'm a special agent with</i>
<i>the FBI's homicide division.</i>

02:01.112 --> 02:03.445
<i>When I'm called out to a scene</i>

02:03.481 --> 02:05.181
<i>where the remains</i>
<i>are badly burnt...</i>

02:05.216 --> 02:08.584
<i>...or decomposed,</i>
<i>I call in Bones.</i>

02:08.761 --> 02:09.860
<i>He calls me "Bones."</i>

02:09.895 --> 02:11.228
Mm-hmm.

02:11.264 --> 02:12.730
Even though I'm his wife

02:12.765 --> 02:15.099
and the mother
of two of his children,

02:15.134 --> 02:18.035
he still refers to me
by a nickname I despise.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.937
Well, you used to despise it,
but now I think you like it.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.238
No, I don't.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.541
Seeley.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.512
After the initial exam
is done at the crime scene,

02:28.548 --> 02:31.449
the remains are brought

02:31.484 --> 02:34.485
to the Jeffersonian's Medico
Legal lab for further analysis.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.388
Cam, we got a ripe one today.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.858
Dr. Hodgins,
please try to remember

02:40.893 --> 02:45.730
that these are the remains of a
human being lying on this table.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.465
Well, yeah, of course.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.335
Also, since we are
a professional establishment,

02:51.371 --> 02:54.572
I would prefer if you
referred to me as Dr. Saroyan.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.675
<i> Yeah, Cam takes</i>
<i>herself pretty seriously.</i>

02:57.710 --> 02:59.276
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.545
Dr. Saroyan takes herself
pretty seriously.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.214
Phew.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.815
Look, all dead
bodies smell, okay?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.450
But dead bodies found
in a landfill

03:06.486 --> 03:07.852
and covered in leachate,

03:07.887 --> 03:09.420
which is basically
a viscous trash water,

03:09.455 --> 03:11.555
they, uh, they tend
to smell worse.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.657
When I first started I had
to dab peppermint oil

03:13.693 --> 03:15.559
under my nose to mask the smell.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.695
I actually tried
growing a mustache,

03:17.730 --> 03:20.164
thinking that it would
block the smell. It didn't.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.932
Just made me look like a creep

03:21.968 --> 03:25.369
who had this ever-present stench
of death in his nostrils.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.571
Yeah, eventually
you get used to it.

03:27.607 --> 03:28.939
The smell, I mean.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.308
Not Hodgins with a mustache.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.277
Every once
in a while, though,

03:33.312 --> 03:35.246
a particularly nasty one
still finds its way in.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.314
Couple of years ago--
you remember this one, Cam?--

03:37.350 --> 03:38.749
we found the remains
of this man submerged

03:38.785 --> 03:40.584
in a pool of his own
vomited up flesh.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.920
Ugh, God.

03:42.955 --> 03:45.956
It smelled like decaying
bile-covered hell.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.792
But from a microbiology
standpoint,

03:47.827 --> 03:48.959
it was pretty awesome.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.494
<i>Now, I mean, come on.</i>

03:50.530 --> 03:52.596
Of course Bug Boy is gonna
say this is awesome.

03:52.632 --> 03:53.898
I mean, think about it,
here's a full-grown man

03:53.933 --> 03:56.967
who plays with bugs,
insects and slime.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.436
All day long.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.237
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love Hodgins.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.839
I think he's great.
But he's a little strange,

04:01.874 --> 04:03.374
he's a little weird, you know?

04:03.409 --> 04:05.676
- Like all the squints.
- "The squints"?

04:05.711 --> 04:08.712
Squints. You know, a nerdy
little person in the lab,

04:08.748 --> 04:12.249
who... all they do is squint
at things. They squint.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.051
Is that... Is he... Oh.
Is he doing his, uh,

04:14.087 --> 04:15.753
squint impression? You
should ask him to do me.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.454
He does a great
impersonation of me.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.356
Right.
I don't have any food on me.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.226
If I did, I'd have to stuff it
in my mouth every ten minutes.

04:22.261 --> 04:23.661
So I can't do that impression.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.463
Okay, he is exaggerating.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.998
I don't eat that much.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.435
So, what's going on?

04:31.471 --> 04:33.137
Are we done here?

04:33.172 --> 04:35.139
What about the case thus far
makes you believe the victim

04:35.174 --> 04:36.574
may have been murdered?
Finding a body

04:36.609 --> 04:37.908
in a landfill, that's, uh...

04:37.944 --> 04:39.877
that's pretty suspicious.
I mean,

04:39.912 --> 04:41.912
sometimes it's murder.
But sometimes it's just

04:41.948 --> 04:44.215
a vagrant who had the misfortune
of taking shelter

04:44.250 --> 04:46.484
in the wrong Dumpster
at the wrong time.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.653
No, not this time. This time
my gut is saying murder.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.957
No. The only time a gut
should be capable of opening

04:52.992 --> 04:56.327
a murder investigation is
when that gut contains poison.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.296
Or a stab wound.
Or a stab wound, yes.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.332
A stab wound to the gut
should also suffice

05:01.367 --> 05:04.034
to open a murder investigation.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.604
Or a gunshot.
That's enough, Dr. Vaziri.

05:06.639 --> 05:10.488
Large projecting mastoid processes
indicate the victim was a male.

05:10.489 --> 05:13.477
While the angular orbital socket
suggests Caucasian,

05:13.513 --> 05:17.348
Mm-hmm.
and the advancing stages of definition

05:17.383 --> 05:19.583
on the dorsal margins
of the pubic surfaces

05:19.619 --> 05:21.085
suggest
an age range

05:21.120 --> 05:23.621
of early- to mid-20s at time of death.
Mmm.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.891
Dr. Vaziri, nice
to see you again.

05:26.926 --> 05:29.693
Yes, you as well, Dr. Saroyan.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.999
Dr. Saroyan,
we are extremely busy.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.584
Is there something
we can help you with?

05:36.585 --> 05:37.869
Yes.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.504
I finished analyzing
the victim's lung tissue

05:40.540 --> 05:44.141
and didn't find any trace
of trash particulates.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.877
Meaning the victim was dead
before coming in contact

05:46.913 --> 05:49.847
with the garbage.
And the only reason a dead body

05:49.882 --> 05:51.982
ends up in the garbage
is when someone's trying

05:52.018 --> 05:54.919
to get rid of it.
So Booth was right.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.688
This man was murdered.

05:57.723 --> 06:01.592
Trust the gut, baby.
Always trust the gut.

<i>we've been talking about</i>

06:35.410 --> 06:36.843
what we want to be
when we grow up.

06:36.878 --> 06:39.612
And now here to tell us
a little bit

06:39.648 --> 06:43.683
about what she does for a living
is Christine's mommy.

06:43.719 --> 06:46.219
Hello.

06:46.254 --> 06:47.654
My name is Dr.
Temperance Brennan,

06:47.689 --> 06:50.357
and I am a forensic
anthropologist.

06:50.392 --> 06:51.958
Can anyone tell me
what that means?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.660
Me!
Yes.

06:53.695 --> 06:56.296
If you're a doctor,
it means you fix bellyaches.

06:56.331 --> 06:58.898
No, that is absolutely
incorrect. What it means

06:58.934 --> 07:00.200
is that I use
skeletal remains

07:00.235 --> 07:03.003
to help law enforcement
solve crimes.

07:03.038 --> 07:05.905
Yes?
How come you only use skeletons?

07:05.941 --> 07:09.042
Because a person's
whole life is written

07:09.077 --> 07:12.379
in their bones. Who they
are, how they died, even

07:12.414 --> 07:14.514
sometimes who
killed them.

07:14.549 --> 07:17.017
What happens to their skin and hair?
Well,

07:17.052 --> 07:19.853
why don't I show you. If
I may draw your attention

07:19.888 --> 07:22.622
to the television
screen.

07:22.657 --> 07:25.759
Okay, this is a set

07:25.794 --> 07:27.961
of human remains in the process

07:27.996 --> 07:30.163
of tissue removal
by dermestid beetle.

07:33.602 --> 07:36.803
Maybe we don't...
use the visuals.

07:41.710 --> 07:44.944
Normally, I'd be doing
a digital reconstruction.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.246
But the skull
was so badly beaten

07:46.281 --> 07:49.315
that I had to come up
with a new plan.

07:49.351 --> 07:53.119
My name is Angela Montenegro,
and I'm a forensic artist.

07:53.155 --> 07:57.123
I'm also kind
of the resident computer nerd,

07:57.159 --> 07:58.291
I guess.

07:58.326 --> 07:59.559
<i>So, oftentimes,</i>

07:59.594 --> 08:01.261
the victim's clothing can lead

08:01.296 --> 08:02.962
to clues about their identity.

08:02.998 --> 08:05.665
Hey, uh, would you hit
the lights?

08:05.700 --> 08:08.668
By using various wavelengths
of light,

08:08.703 --> 08:10.970
I should be able to read
what's printed

08:11.006 --> 08:14.074
beneath the staining
on the victim's shirt.

08:17.379 --> 08:18.878
Okay.

08:20.315 --> 08:23.283
All right.
So, in the center of the shirt,

08:23.318 --> 08:27.487
it looks like there's an image
of an upside-down triangle

08:27.522 --> 08:29.689
with some writing over it.

08:29.724 --> 08:31.524
I think it says...

08:31.560 --> 08:33.827
"American Pie Pizza."

08:33.861 --> 08:35.528
<i>Hey.</i>

08:35.563 --> 08:36.830
Guys, come here. Come here.

08:36.865 --> 08:38.631
You're gonna love this.
This is so cool.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.034
Okay, knowing that the victim
was buried in this trash, right,

08:41.068 --> 08:42.836
I figured
that if I could date the trash,

08:42.871 --> 08:45.205
I could actually determine
exactly when the victim

08:45.240 --> 08:48.041
was thrown into this.
So, being the genius that I am,

08:48.076 --> 08:52.112
I actually combined the sell-by
date on a carton of eggs

08:52.147 --> 08:54.948
with a Blockbuster Video receipt

08:54.983 --> 08:57.984
and some of these,
known as newspapers,

08:58.019 --> 09:01.221
to combine them together and
determine the victim was tossed

09:01.256 --> 09:05.225
in this garbage on or around
January 12, 2006.

09:05.260 --> 09:08.194
Boom. And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

09:08.230 --> 09:10.563
that is why they call me
king of the lab.

09:10.599 --> 09:12.932
<i> N-No one calls him</i>
<i>king of the lab.</i>

09:12.968 --> 09:14.634
No one other than himself,

09:14.669 --> 09:16.336
- at least.
<i>- He also calls himself</i>

09:16.371 --> 09:18.938
the king of the break room.
King of the parking lot.

09:18.974 --> 09:21.908
Oh, and once after making
an anonymous donation,

09:21.943 --> 09:24.511
- he was the king of modesty.
<i>- I once heard</i>

09:24.546 --> 09:26.546
Dr. Hodgins refer to himself

09:26.581 --> 09:29.249
- as the king of Egypt.
<i>- The Jeffersonian</i>

09:29.284 --> 09:33.153
has this, uh,
ancient Egyptian wing,

09:33.188 --> 09:35.622
inside of which
there is this huge bed,

09:35.657 --> 09:38.057
which is so perfect for...

09:38.093 --> 09:39.859
Let's just say if Hodgins
is the king of Egypt,

09:39.895 --> 09:42.795
then I'm most definitely
the queen.

09:42.831 --> 09:44.731
<i>Marriage between royalty</i>

09:44.766 --> 09:48.801
in ancient Egypt
was often incestuous.

09:50.772 --> 09:53.773
There you go.
Give us a call.

09:55.977 --> 09:59.012
So, the, uh, owner says that
our description of the victim

09:59.047 --> 10:01.781
lines up with a guy that used to
work here about ten years ago.

10:01.816 --> 10:05.418
A, uh, delivery guy
by the name of Brandon Bloom.

10:05.453 --> 10:07.487
Oh.

10:07.522 --> 10:11.858
So what did you think of Dr.
Brennan's presentation today?

10:11.893 --> 10:13.626
She smelled pretty.

10:13.662 --> 10:15.862
I think her job is gross.

10:15.897 --> 10:19.065
- She's smarter than Ms. Susan.
<i>- In addition</i>

10:19.100 --> 10:20.900
to being a best-selling author,

10:20.936 --> 10:23.303
I also hold three doctorates

10:23.338 --> 10:25.071
and I-I speak eight languages,

10:25.106 --> 10:26.639
two of which
you've probably never heard of.

10:26.675 --> 10:29.442
So, yes, I think
it's safe to say

10:29.477 --> 10:33.246
that I am indeed smarter
than Ms. Susan.

10:34.282 --> 10:36.149
Hey, Dr. Brennan,
welcome back.

10:36.184 --> 10:38.117
I, um...

10:38.153 --> 10:41.754
We were just discussing
the case, and,

10:41.790 --> 10:43.590
um... But
enough about us.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.892
How was, uh, Career Day
at Christine's school?

10:45.927 --> 10:48.895
It went well. Christine
remained alert, attentive,

10:48.930 --> 10:52.298
and inquisitive throughout
the entire presentation,

10:52.334 --> 10:54.167
all attributes
which will

10:54.202 --> 10:57.270
make her a fantastic
forensic anthropologist one day.

10:57.305 --> 10:58.371
That's excellent.

10:58.406 --> 10:59.539
I had no idea she wanted

10:59.574 --> 11:00.807
to follow in your footsteps.

11:00.842 --> 11:02.008
Well...

11:02.043 --> 11:03.409
I'm the world's

11:03.445 --> 11:04.877
foremost forensic anthropologist

11:04.913 --> 11:06.112
and Christina's my daughter.

11:06.147 --> 11:07.413
It would be foolish of her not

11:07.449 --> 11:09.549
to take advantage
of that level of access.

11:09.584 --> 11:12.452
<i>Do you have children</i>
<i>of your own, Dr. Saroyan?</i>

11:12.487 --> 11:13.887
I do, but that's
all you're getting,

11:13.922 --> 11:15.888
because like I said
when we started,

11:15.924 --> 11:18.057
I'm not interested
in sharing the details

11:18.093 --> 11:20.326
of my personal life
with the world.

11:20.362 --> 11:23.229
Oh...

11:23.265 --> 11:24.665
I found numerous
remodeled fractures

11:24.699 --> 11:27.233
on the radii
as well as the left tibia.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.171
The amount of remodeling

11:32.207 --> 11:34.807
suggests the victim
sustained these injuries

11:34.843 --> 11:36.876
as a child.

11:36.911 --> 11:39.345
I'm currently in the process
of reconstructing the skull.

11:39.381 --> 11:43.549
But I did notice what appears to
be a remodeled cranial fracture

11:43.585 --> 11:44.951
with its radiating lines
positioned

11:44.986 --> 11:46.686
across the coronal suture.

11:46.721 --> 11:49.155
Well, all these injuries
are indicative

11:49.190 --> 11:51.691
of childhood abuse.

11:53.995 --> 11:57.030
So, after Aubrey
got me the name,

11:57.065 --> 11:59.098
I was able to use
the hospital records

11:59.134 --> 12:03.336
to confirm
the victim's identity.

12:03.371 --> 12:05.338
Name is Brandon Bloom.

12:05.373 --> 12:08.007
25-year-old pizza delivery guy.

12:08.043 --> 12:10.410
The only family member
we were able to track down

12:10.445 --> 12:12.312
was his father,
who, by the way,

12:12.347 --> 12:14.414
never reported his son missing.

12:14.449 --> 12:18.284
On top of the fact that his son
may have been abused as a child,

12:18.320 --> 12:21.888
it makes my job
that much more difficult.

12:21.923 --> 12:23.456
Why is that?

12:23.491 --> 12:25.992
'Cause now I have to tell

12:26.027 --> 12:27.794
the dad that his son is dead.

12:27.829 --> 12:30.830
<i>At the same time, I got</i>
<i>to treat him as a suspect.</i>

12:32.467 --> 12:34.167
Mr. Bloom?

12:34.202 --> 12:35.768
We found your son Brandon.

12:35.804 --> 12:38.604
He was murdered.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.607
Murdered, what...?

12:41.643 --> 12:43.676
What...?

12:43.712 --> 12:44.811
What?!

12:44.846 --> 12:46.346
We found him, um,

12:46.381 --> 12:49.282
lying in a landfill
for the past ten years.

12:49.317 --> 12:52.352
Is there a reason why you
didn't report him missing?

12:52.387 --> 12:54.354
Brandon always talked
about dropping everything

12:54.389 --> 12:56.522
and moving to the Caribbean

12:56.558 --> 12:57.657
to become a bartender.

12:57.692 --> 12:59.258
I just figured he,
he finally did it.

12:59.294 --> 13:00.660
"Figured"?

13:00.695 --> 13:02.061
I'm sorry, you figured?

13:02.097 --> 13:03.930
This is your son
we're talking about.

13:03.965 --> 13:05.431
Why didn't you call?

13:05.467 --> 13:07.667
Brandon and I didn't have
the best relationship.

13:07.702 --> 13:10.770
When he dropped out of college,
I was angry, pissed.

13:10.805 --> 13:14.006
I just didn't want him
to wind up like me.

13:14.042 --> 13:17.009
Working back-breaking jobs
for minimum wage

13:17.045 --> 13:18.478
the rest of his life...

13:18.513 --> 13:20.480
When was the last time
you talked to him

13:20.515 --> 13:22.348
or you saw him?

13:22.384 --> 13:24.717
Oh, I called him
for his 25th birthday.

13:24.753 --> 13:26.152
That would've been, uh,

13:26.187 --> 13:28.688
December 8, 2005?

13:28.723 --> 13:31.057
All right, we also got some
information that he was

13:31.092 --> 13:32.392
abused as a kid.

13:32.427 --> 13:33.827
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:33.862 --> 13:35.595
Why don't you tell me?

13:35.630 --> 13:38.398
He rode skateboards.
He rode BMX bikes.

13:38.433 --> 13:40.133
He was always
falling and breaking

13:40.168 --> 13:42.335
a different bone
every other week.

13:42.370 --> 13:44.370
You don't believe me, do you?

13:44.406 --> 13:46.339
What?

13:46.374 --> 13:48.007
You think I killed my son?

13:48.042 --> 13:50.209
No, I'm just asking a question,
that's all.

13:50.245 --> 13:51.978
You tell me that my son is dead,

13:52.013 --> 13:55.982
and the exact same breath,
you accuse me of doing it?

13:56.017 --> 13:58.050
Hmm?

13:58.086 --> 14:00.586
Really?

14:04.225 --> 14:06.426
What kind of a monster
are you, huh?

14:14.790 --> 14:17.720
Come on over here.
Let's get your pillow on here...

14:17.721 --> 14:19.220
- Stand up straight, hold that.
<i>- Being a father yourself,</i>

14:19.256 --> 14:20.256
<i>how do you accuse a man</i>

14:20.290 --> 14:21.389
<i>of killing his own child?</i>

14:21.425 --> 14:22.690
<i> Look, I love my children</i>

14:22.726 --> 14:24.692
<i>and I'd bend the world</i>
<i>to protect them.</i>

14:24.728 --> 14:27.662
<i>To-to think about harming one</i>
<i>of them is inconceivable to me.</i>

14:27.697 --> 14:29.731
<i>But, you see,</i>
<i>there's darkness in this world.</i>

14:29.766 --> 14:31.800
Ready?
<i>And just because you or I</i>

14:31.835 --> 14:35.437
<i>might not be able to see it</i>
<i>doesn't mean it isn't there.</i>

14:35.472 --> 14:37.205
Oh, what a save!
<i>Now, I certainly hope this man</i>

14:37.240 --> 14:39.574
<i>didn't kill his own child.</i>
Whoa!

14:39.609 --> 14:42.343
<i>But at the end of the day</i>
<i>my loyalty isn't to him.</i>

14:42.379 --> 14:43.778
<i>It's to the kid.</i>

14:43.814 --> 14:46.147
Save! They win the Cup!

14:46.183 --> 14:47.882
They win the Cup!
Come on, give me a hug!

14:47.918 --> 14:49.451
- They won the Cup!
<i>- Upon further examination</i>

14:49.486 --> 14:53.154
of the victim's
bones, I discovered evidence

14:53.190 --> 14:56.691
of a remodeled Colles' fracture
on the left radius.

14:56.726 --> 14:59.961
Its presence suggests
that the victim's father

14:59.996 --> 15:02.997
may have been telling the truth
about the origin

15:03.033 --> 15:05.967
of his son's childhood injuries.

15:07.337 --> 15:09.237
So, after Brandon went missing,

15:09.272 --> 15:11.372
the room that he was renting
just sat empty.

15:11.408 --> 15:14.309
Eventually, the kid's landlord
boxed up all of his belongings,

15:14.344 --> 15:16.010
gave 'em to Brandon's dad.

15:16.046 --> 15:17.979
There's, uh,
not really much in here.

15:18.014 --> 15:21.916
We got a <i> Dodgeball</i> DVD, uh,
some... a couple old magazines,

15:21.952 --> 15:25.887
and, uh, oh, yeah--
a whole bunch of burned CDs.

15:25.922 --> 15:28.857
Apparently the victim
was a big Linkin Park fan.

15:28.892 --> 15:31.626
Of course, not big enough
to actually buy their music,

15:31.661 --> 15:33.828
but certainly enough
to steal it.

15:33.864 --> 15:37.465
Also liked Papa Roach,

15:37.501 --> 15:40.335
Hoobastank and, uh...

15:40.370 --> 15:43.538
Oh. "Financial Stuff."
Right.

15:43.573 --> 15:47.609
Well, let's see what
this one's all about here.

15:52.215 --> 15:54.315
Right.

15:57.554 --> 15:59.921
Okay, so this looks like
a spreadsheet

15:59.956 --> 16:03.725
of all of Brandon's finances.
Mainly just a list of his bills.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.095
Rent, cell phone.

16:07.130 --> 16:10.231
Wait a minute.

16:10.267 --> 16:13.668
At the time of his death,
Brandon owed $3,000

16:13.703 --> 16:17.605
to someone listed here
as "C. Collins".

16:17.641 --> 16:20.208
That-- that's exactly
what we're looking for, okay?

16:20.243 --> 16:22.177
When it comes to murder, money--

16:22.212 --> 16:23.811
always a motive.

16:23.847 --> 16:26.814
<i> Knowing what was</i>
<i>in a victim's system</i>

16:26.850 --> 16:29.584
when they died often paints
a clearer picture

16:29.619 --> 16:32.520
of how they lived.
And, uh,

16:32.556 --> 16:35.857
according to
the tox screen results,

16:35.892 --> 16:39.527
our victim lived in a cloud
of marijuana smoke.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.430
There were
extremely high levels of THC

16:42.465 --> 16:44.132
in Brandon's system
when he died.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.100
That would explain his
questionable taste in music.

16:46.136 --> 16:48.803
Uh, Dr. Saroyan, if you have
a moment I'd like to show you

16:48.838 --> 16:50.371
something I discovered
on the bones.

16:50.407 --> 16:52.941
Oh... Oh, uh...

16:52.976 --> 16:54.442
I still
haven't found

16:54.477 --> 16:56.110
cause of death,
but I did notice

16:56.146 --> 16:58.346
a couple of perimortem
hairline fractures

16:58.381 --> 16:59.914
on the victim's right ulna.

16:59.950 --> 17:01.616
Do you think these
could be defensive wounds?

17:01.651 --> 17:03.718
Yes. The description of the
wounds leads me to believe

17:03.753 --> 17:06.387
they were created by a
weapon with rounded edges.

17:06.423 --> 17:08.589
Hmm.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.724
The degree of curvature
makes me wonder

17:10.760 --> 17:14.462
if both these wounds could have
been sustained by a single blow.

17:19.035 --> 17:21.469
The distance between
the injuries is...

17:21.503 --> 17:25.205
26.8 centimeters, roughly
the width of a tennis racket.

17:25.242 --> 17:27.308
The injuries could have been
made by the beams.

17:27.344 --> 17:28.876
I'll notify Booth.

17:28.912 --> 17:30.979
The two of you make
a pretty good team,

17:31.014 --> 17:32.914
the way you work
off of each other.

17:32.949 --> 17:34.816
We do make a good
team, don't we?

17:34.851 --> 17:37.185
Well, uh, t... we've been
working together a long time.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.754
That's all.
There's-there's nothing special

17:39.789 --> 17:42.056
about my relationship
with Dr. Vaziri.

17:42.092 --> 17:44.826
It's, uh, no different
than my relationship

17:44.861 --> 17:46.761
with any of the other interns.

17:46.796 --> 17:49.631
<i>I think Dr. Saroyan is</i>
<i>an excellent boss.</i>

17:49.666 --> 17:51.332
She's not one of those
micromanagers always hovering

17:51.368 --> 17:52.900
over your shoulder.
She gives us the space

17:52.936 --> 17:54.502
we need to do our best work.

17:54.537 --> 17:56.804
What do you think of her
on a personal level?

17:56.840 --> 17:59.974
Okay, I-I think
that's about enough.

18:01.845 --> 18:04.912
Well, before your next speech
maybe you could

18:04.948 --> 18:07.315
hand out sick bags.
You'll be happy to know

18:07.350 --> 18:09.417
that Christine remained unfazed

18:09.452 --> 18:11.619
while witnessing the bones
being defleshed.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.589
She's used to it, okay?
At home, you have pi-pictures

18:14.624 --> 18:16.664
of dead bodies just lying around
all over the place.

18:16.693 --> 18:18.960
I'm just trying to prepare her.
For what, therapy?

18:18.995 --> 18:21.596
Her future as a forensic anthropologist.
No, she's not

18:21.631 --> 18:23.131
gonna be a squint, okay?
She is gonna be

18:23.166 --> 18:24.932
a hockey player in the NHL.

18:24.968 --> 18:27.101
That's ridiculous, Booth.
That's not ridiculous, okay?

18:27.137 --> 18:30.338
In '91 there was a goaltender
who played for Tampa Bay--

18:30.373 --> 18:32.440
Manon Rhéaume-- she was amazing.

18:32.475 --> 18:34.042
I'm well aware
that a woman

18:34.077 --> 18:36.311
can do anything a man can do.
What is ridiculous

18:36.346 --> 18:39.247
is the notion that
our daughter would dedicate

18:39.282 --> 18:41.115
her brilliant mind
to the purpose

18:41.151 --> 18:42.650
of swatting away rubber pucks.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.085
Okay, look, I'm just saying

18:44.120 --> 18:46.120
I don't want her
wasting her childhood

18:46.156 --> 18:47.989
looking at bones and-and

18:48.024 --> 18:50.191
thinking about death all the time.
I looked at bones

18:50.226 --> 18:51.693
and thought about death
as a child

18:51.728 --> 18:53.461
and I don't think
it was a waste.

18:53.496 --> 18:55.229
<i>I've known I wanted a career</i>

18:55.265 --> 18:59.200
in anthropology
since I was five years old.

18:59.235 --> 19:01.602
<i>I used to dissect the carcasses</i>

19:01.638 --> 19:04.706
<i>of dead animals</i>
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

19:04.741 --> 19:06.341
<i>Roadkill. Old pets.</i>

19:06.376 --> 19:09.644
<i>The occasional dead bird</i>
<i>outside the window.</i>

19:09.679 --> 19:12.747
The other kids thought
I was weird.

19:12.782 --> 19:15.016
They'd call me names.

19:15.051 --> 19:17.719
Morticia...

19:17.754 --> 19:19.387
Jenny Dahmer.

19:21.391 --> 19:24.859
But I never let it stop me.

19:24.894 --> 19:27.628
Because I knew that I was

19:27.664 --> 19:30.498
going to make something
of myself one day.

19:31.835 --> 19:34.602
Well, this job was
supposed to be temporary.

19:34.637 --> 19:36.604
The plan was
to make enough money

19:36.639 --> 19:40.041
to get to Paris and paint. So...

19:40.076 --> 19:41.876
So why didn't you?

19:41.911 --> 19:45.446
Honestly, I thought
Booth was kind of cute.

19:45.482 --> 19:47.582
But then she thought
"Why settle for cute

19:47.617 --> 19:49.751
when you could have
ruggedly handsome?"

19:50.954 --> 19:52.253
What do you have, honey?

19:52.288 --> 19:53.554
Uh, yeah, so, I actually think

19:53.590 --> 19:54.989
I struck gold.
I found this flip phone

19:55.024 --> 19:56.624
<i>in the trash pile.</i>

19:56.659 --> 19:58.126
<i>'Cause of the Linkin Park,</i>

19:58.161 --> 19:59.460
<i>um, sticker there,</i>
<i>I thought it might have</i>

19:59.496 --> 20:01.829
<i>actually belonged</i>
<i>to our victim.</i>

20:01.865 --> 20:03.931
So, cell phone companies don't
usually retain their records

20:03.967 --> 20:06.567
beyond ten years, so if we
want to find out who the victim

20:06.603 --> 20:09.404
was talking to on the day of
his death, then we have to...

20:09.439 --> 20:12.507
Then we need my extremely smart,
extremely beautiful wife

20:12.542 --> 20:14.108
to reconstruct the phone.

20:14.144 --> 20:16.978
Which... You're actually
probably gonna want these.

20:17.013 --> 20:20.214
Ooh. That, uh, phone there,
it smells like it's been

20:20.250 --> 20:22.750
bathing in trash water
for the past ten years.

20:22.786 --> 20:27.422
Which, by the way, it has.

20:27.457 --> 20:30.191
I should have gone to Paris.

20:30.226 --> 20:32.293
<i>So, there are over 60</i>

20:32.328 --> 20:35.396
C. Collins living in or around
Montgomery County.

20:35.432 --> 20:38.266
But only one of them, a guy
by the name of Carl Collins,

20:38.301 --> 20:39.934
has been arrested
multiple times for dealing pot

20:39.969 --> 20:41.636
in the victim's hometown
of Rockville.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.604
You think the $3,000
the victim owed

20:43.640 --> 20:45.139
may have been a drug debt?

20:45.175 --> 20:47.175
Well, we know that the victim
liked his pot.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.043
He certainly didn't have
anything else in his life

20:49.078 --> 20:50.845
worth that kind of money,
so, yeah,

20:50.880 --> 20:53.514
it seems like
a pretty good theory.

20:57.887 --> 21:01.255
Carl Collins, we're
with the FBI.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.058
Oh, man.
Am I on <i> Cops?</i>

21:04.093 --> 21:05.560
Well,
something like that.

21:05.595 --> 21:08.296
Do you remember a guy
by the name of Brandon Bloom?

21:08.331 --> 21:10.898
Yeah, of course,
I remember the Bloom-atic.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.868
What's that dill weed been up
to? I haven't seen him in years.

21:13.903 --> 21:15.536
Well, the Bloom-atic
is dead. He was murdered

21:15.572 --> 21:17.212
about ten years ago.
Right around the time

21:17.240 --> 21:19.006
he owed you
quite a bit of money.

21:19.042 --> 21:20.975
He's dead?
That's jacked up.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.910
Bloom was my boy.

21:22.946 --> 21:25.379
Carl, what's going on out there?
I told you I didn't want

21:25.415 --> 21:27.248
any of that going on
around my house.

21:27.283 --> 21:29.584
Relax, Ma.
We're not doing anything.

21:29.619 --> 21:30.852
Who are the cameras?
They're...

21:30.887 --> 21:32.487
my friends, okay?

21:32.522 --> 21:34.021
We're filming a movie.

21:34.057 --> 21:36.123
Just go back inside, will you?

21:39.496 --> 21:41.496
So, uh, Brandon
was your boy, huh?

21:41.531 --> 21:44.065
Yeah, damn straight.
We were business partners.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.833
Right, selling pot.
Nah, man.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.802
Selling T-shirts.

21:47.837 --> 21:50.071
The money he owed me--
that was for inventory.

21:50.106 --> 21:51.839
Here, I'll show you.
These damn things

21:51.875 --> 21:53.508
didn't sell
for crap.

21:53.543 --> 21:55.376
I'll say they didn't.

21:55.411 --> 21:57.411
Not a single one.

21:57.447 --> 22:00.114
Stupid, stuck-up town.

22:00.149 --> 22:02.416
"Stupid, stuck-up town."
Yeah, check it out.

22:02.452 --> 22:05.052
I'm sorry,
are those two pigs?

22:05.088 --> 22:07.889
Wait till you check out
the back. "Porking."

22:07.924 --> 22:09.290
It's funny, right?
Yeah, makin' bacon.

22:09.325 --> 22:11.726
That is funny.
I got nine more boxes

22:11.761 --> 22:12.960
if you guys are interested.

22:12.996 --> 22:14.228
No, I think we're good.

22:14.264 --> 22:15.530
But, listen, did
Brandon mention

22:15.565 --> 22:16.898
anything going on
in his life

22:16.933 --> 22:18.733
around the time that
he stopped coming around?

22:18.768 --> 22:20.301
Anybody that might've
wanted to hurt him?

22:20.336 --> 22:21.769
Uh, you guys should talk
to that chick, Amy.

22:21.804 --> 22:23.271
Amy.
Yeah.

22:23.306 --> 22:24.505
They had a pretty nasty breakup.

22:24.541 --> 22:27.041
And... oh, damn.

22:27.076 --> 22:28.676
It was right around
the same time

22:28.711 --> 22:30.011
that Brandon stopped coming by.

22:30.046 --> 22:31.579
Wow, he breaks up
with his girl,

22:31.614 --> 22:34.115
then disappears.
You don't think that's odd?

22:34.150 --> 22:35.550
What, I was supposed to think

22:35.585 --> 22:37.385
that the dude got murdered?

22:37.420 --> 22:39.120
No. Amy was a total goody-good.

22:39.155 --> 22:40.555
She was going to school,

22:40.590 --> 22:43.057
playing sports, you know,
being all healthy.

22:43.092 --> 22:44.892
What kind of sports she play?

22:44.928 --> 22:46.260
Oh, man.

22:46.296 --> 22:49.030
I'd have to think...

22:51.801 --> 22:53.067
Got it?

22:53.102 --> 22:54.435
Come on.

22:56.139 --> 22:58.005
Tennis. I think it was tennis.
Tennis.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.840
I think it was tennis.
Tennis, tennis.

22:59.876 --> 23:01.309
Hey, man,
when is this gonna be on?

23:01.344 --> 23:02.443
What?
My episode of <i> Cops.</i>

23:02.478 --> 23:05.279
I just want to tell
my peeps when to watch.

23:07.892 --> 23:09.818
2.2, all cash.

23:09.918 --> 23:11.890
Three-day close.
Take it or leave it.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.090
Can you, uh,
hang up the phone

23:13.124 --> 23:14.590
and have a seat,
please, Ms. Lee?

23:14.626 --> 23:17.026
Look, I'm really sorry
to hear about Brandon.

23:17.061 --> 23:19.529
But I don't know how
I'm supposed to help.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.264
I haven't seen him
in over ten years.

23:21.299 --> 23:24.400
Which is exactly the amount
of time that he's been dead.

23:24.435 --> 23:25.768
And according to Carl Collins,

23:25.804 --> 23:27.236
you two had
a pretty nasty breakup

23:27.272 --> 23:29.472
right before he was murdered.
Carl Collins?

23:29.507 --> 23:31.107
Carl Collins is a moron.

23:31.142 --> 23:33.442
Is he still dealing pot
out of his mom's basement?

23:33.478 --> 23:34.977
Okay, let's not worry
about Carl, all right?

23:35.013 --> 23:37.180
Listen, why don't you, uh...
why don't you tell me

23:37.215 --> 23:38.881
about your relationship with Brandon?
Brandon was

23:38.917 --> 23:40.416
actually a sweet guy.

23:40.451 --> 23:42.785
He just had no idea
what he wanted out of life.

23:42.821 --> 23:45.822
He was aimless, jumping
from one crappy job to the next,

23:45.857 --> 23:47.490
just like his father.

23:47.525 --> 23:48.958
That must have been frustrating

23:48.993 --> 23:51.327
for someone
as driven as yourself.

23:51.362 --> 23:54.430
Ugh. The T-shirt fiasco
was the last straw.

23:54.465 --> 23:56.833
Brandon lost thousands trying
to sell these ridiculous shirts.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.901
We got
into a big fight about it.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.303
He said if I couldn't

24:00.338 --> 24:01.971
support his dream,
I should leave.

24:02.006 --> 24:05.308
His dream was to sell
neon green, X-rated T-shirts?

24:05.343 --> 24:06.676
I don't know what

24:06.711 --> 24:08.578
his dream was,
and neither did he,

24:08.613 --> 24:11.080
so I did what he suggested
and left.

24:11.115 --> 24:12.815
And not to be crass,

24:12.851 --> 24:15.818
kind of sounds like
I made the right choice.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.520
<i>I just feel bad for the victim.</i>

24:17.555 --> 24:20.056
I feel like he never found
his place in the world.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.490
Well, perhaps
he never found it

24:21.526 --> 24:23.292
because he was never
really looking.

24:23.328 --> 24:25.761
He seemed very content
living a small life

24:25.797 --> 24:28.531
as a drug-abusing
delivery boy.

24:28.566 --> 24:30.433
Well, I just know
that it's a tough spot to be in.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.869
- That's all.
<i>- So, Agent Booth,</i>

24:32.904 --> 24:34.570
<i>you were an athlete growing up?</i>

24:34.606 --> 24:36.205
Hockey and football--

24:36.241 --> 24:37.840
I mean, those were my
two sports. My two big sports.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.742
I played both them all the way
through high school.

24:39.777 --> 24:42.912
Actually got a scholarship to,
to play football in college,

24:42.947 --> 24:44.447
<i>but that didn't go too well,</i>

24:44.482 --> 24:46.816
<i>because I ended up</i>
<i>wrenching my shoulder,</i>

24:46.851 --> 24:49.452
<i>and that put an end</i>
<i>to my football career.</i>

24:49.487 --> 24:50.820
So for the first time,

24:50.855 --> 24:52.755
I actually had
to really think about

24:52.790 --> 24:54.390
what I wanted to do in life.

24:54.425 --> 24:55.858
So after about two years

24:55.894 --> 24:57.660
of just tooling around
and doing nothing,

24:57.695 --> 24:59.562
<i>I decided to do</i>
<i>what my family was doing.</i>

24:59.597 --> 25:00.963
<i>That was join the military.</i>

25:00.999 --> 25:02.798
<i>After spending a little bit</i>
<i>too much</i>

25:02.834 --> 25:05.368
time there, in the military,
it kind of made my transition

25:05.403 --> 25:09.038
a lot easier
into, um, law enforcement.

25:09.073 --> 25:10.673
Maybe not that easy,
'cause, you know,

25:10.708 --> 25:13.142
I had to still work
with the squints.

25:13.177 --> 25:15.845
Christine, what is it you want
to be when you grow up?

25:15.880 --> 25:18.726
Do you want to be a forensic
anthropologist like Mommy?

25:18.750 --> 25:19.283
Nah.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.051
Oh, ouch, Bones.
That's-that's got to hurt, eh?

25:22.086 --> 25:25.254
She wants to be a goalie
for the Philadelphia Flyers.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.489
Nah.

25:26.524 --> 25:27.823
Hmm.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.392
Well, what do you want
to do, sweetheart?

25:29.427 --> 25:31.394
She's six years old. She's got
a lot of time to decide.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.562
I want to sell cars
like Toby's daddy.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.167
<i>- Yeah, she can sell cars.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

25:38.202 --> 25:39.902
Absolutely not!
Our daughter is not going

25:39.938 --> 25:41.837
to be selling cars
for a living, Booth.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.205
Why? Look, we
support our daughter.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.740
No.
No matter what she does, we love...

25:44.776 --> 25:47.076
Not me.
Bones, come on.

25:47.111 --> 25:48.744
That's not what
this is about, okay?

25:48.780 --> 25:51.113
If Sweets was here,
you know, he would probably say

25:51.149 --> 25:54.116
that by Christine
rejecting your job,

25:54.152 --> 25:56.419
you feel like
she's rejecting you.

25:56.454 --> 25:59.355
Well, that is absolutely what
he would say, but he'd be wrong

25:59.390 --> 26:01.090
because psychology
is not a real science, so...

26:01.125 --> 26:03.392
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
you two were in therapy.

26:03.428 --> 26:04.994
We're not.
Well, we were.

26:05.029 --> 26:07.163
We're... Well...
Sweets was a friend, but...

26:07.198 --> 26:09.598
Mm-hmm.
...he's dead now.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.674
He was a psychologist
with the Bureau, and, um,

26:12.709 --> 26:16.611
I would argue that...
he's probably the reason

26:16.646 --> 26:18.213
why we're together?

26:18.248 --> 26:20.148
I would say,
yeah, pretty much.

26:20.183 --> 26:22.684
We still miss him a lot.

26:22.720 --> 26:26.455
Yeah. He was a good
friend, and, uh,

26:26.490 --> 26:31.326
this job can be
hard sometimes.

26:31.362 --> 26:33.596
<i>I was at, uh,</i>

26:33.631 --> 26:35.631
<i>Booth and Brennan's house</i>
<i>for dinner.</i>

26:35.665 --> 26:37.999
<i>It was supposed</i>
<i>to be a couples night,</i>

26:38.034 --> 26:42.337
<i>but then Hodgins got</i>
<i>called out to a crime scene.</i>

26:42.372 --> 26:45.206
<i>As soon as my phone rang, I</i>
<i>knew that something was wrong.</i>

26:45.242 --> 26:49.778
<i>They said a-a bomb had gone off</i>
<i>at the scene and that...</i>

26:49.814 --> 26:52.548
<i>Hodgins was in the hospital.</i>

26:52.582 --> 26:54.649
<i>He was...</i>

26:54.684 --> 26:56.985
paralyzed from the waist down.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.187
<i>Zack?</i>

26:59.223 --> 27:02.758
Yeah, um, Dr. Zack Addy was
a forensic anthropologist

27:02.793 --> 27:04.692
who worked here
at the Jeffersonian.

27:04.728 --> 27:07.929
He was a... sweet kid and, um,

27:07.964 --> 27:09.364
<i>a really dear friend.</i>

27:09.399 --> 27:11.266
<i>I think just, you know,</i>
<i>working here around...</i>

27:11.301 --> 27:13.541
<i>around all the... all the death</i>
<i>and murder was just, um--</i>

27:13.570 --> 27:15.804
<i>it was a little...</i>
<i>it was a little too much.</i>

27:15.840 --> 27:19.275
Dr. Addy had to be
institutionalized?

27:19.310 --> 27:21.277
Is that correct?

27:21.311 --> 27:23.645
Yes.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.614
That is correct.

27:26.650 --> 27:29.017
<i>A few years back,</i>

27:29.052 --> 27:32.353
after Zack left, there was
an intern here named Vincent.

27:32.389 --> 27:33.822
Really cool guy.

27:33.857 --> 27:36.191
Always spouting these weird,
obscure facts.

27:36.226 --> 27:40.028
Anyway, Vincent had been working
a serial sniper case.

27:40.063 --> 27:41.463
It was dangerous.

27:41.499 --> 27:43.199
We all knew
the killer was still out there,

27:43.233 --> 27:45.600
but we figured we were at least
safe here in the lab.

27:45.635 --> 27:48.336
Vincent was right there
on the platform

27:48.371 --> 27:51.139
when the bullet shattered the
window and hit him in the chest.

27:51.174 --> 27:53.675
He died in Dr. Brennan's arms.

27:53.710 --> 27:55.877
She took it pretty hard.

27:55.912 --> 27:57.612
Dr. Brennan's our mentor,

27:57.647 --> 27:59.414
and even though
she'll never admit it,

27:59.449 --> 28:02.484
I think she tends to regard all
of her interns as her children.

28:02.519 --> 28:04.118
So to lose one...

28:04.154 --> 28:06.621
Dr. Vaziri, we have yet to
determine cause of death,

28:06.656 --> 28:08.723
so stop talking and
get back to work.

28:08.759 --> 28:11.227
Yes, ma'am.

28:20.337 --> 28:21.903
I was doing
some research,

28:21.938 --> 28:23.938
and I discovered the
type of tennis racket

28:23.974 --> 28:25.373
the victim's ex used
throughout college.

28:25.408 --> 28:27.342
And was it a match
for the defensive wounds

28:27.378 --> 28:29.912
we found on the victim's ulna?
The width of the beams

28:29.947 --> 28:32.915
on her racket were too thin
to have created these injuries.

28:32.949 --> 28:34.315
There appears to be a fracture

28:34.351 --> 28:36.918
on the distal shaft
of the fourth metacarpal.

28:36.953 --> 28:38.853
A boxers fracture.

28:38.889 --> 28:40.588
The victim must have
punched his killer.

28:40.624 --> 28:43.925
If the punch was delivered
with enough force

28:43.960 --> 28:45.860
to break
the victim's hand,

28:45.896 --> 28:49.564
it may have been powerful
enough to injure our killer.

28:51.935 --> 28:54.836
How's it, uh, coming with
the victim's cell phone?

28:54.871 --> 28:57.338
Well, it was too damaged
to reconstruct,

28:57.374 --> 29:00.174
but I was able to recover
the memory chip, so,

29:00.210 --> 29:02.243
with the help
of this JTAG emulator,

29:02.279 --> 29:04.879
I should be able
to retrieve the chip's data.

29:07.050 --> 29:09.350
Wow. Uh, hopefully,

29:09.386 --> 29:10.952
you'll be able to read this,

29:10.987 --> 29:12.678
'cause I have no idea
what any of it means.

29:12.679 --> 29:13.722
Oh, well,

29:13.723 --> 29:15.557
it doesn't mean anything
until I input

29:15.592 --> 29:18.626
the phone's operating system
and file structure.

29:20.163 --> 29:23.131
Okay.

29:23.166 --> 29:25.099
All right, so now we have a list

29:25.135 --> 29:28.202
of all the calls made and
received on the victim's phone.

29:28.238 --> 29:30.872
The last incoming call came
from the victim's father.

29:30.907 --> 29:33.875
And it looks like they spoke
for a good seven minutes

29:33.910 --> 29:35.743
on the night of
Brandon's death.

29:35.779 --> 29:37.645
I thought the dad said

29:37.681 --> 29:40.214
he and Brandon weren't
on speaking terms?

29:40.250 --> 29:43.251
That's what he said, but
it's certainly not the truth.

29:44.955 --> 29:46.788
So, knowing that our victim had
been in a fight with his killer,

29:46.823 --> 29:49.257
I've been checking with
hospitals around Rockville,

29:49.292 --> 29:51.192
which is actually difficult
because of the whole time thing.

29:51.227 --> 29:52.354
Aubrey, do you have
anything for me or not?

29:52.378 --> 29:54.163
Just, okay, on the night

29:54.164 --> 29:55.897
of Brandon's death, his father
checked into St. Andrews

29:55.932 --> 29:57.565
with a broken orbital socket.

29:57.601 --> 29:59.601
Oh, busted eye. I mean,
that's the same type of injury

29:59.636 --> 30:01.369
you would get if
you were in a fight.

30:01.404 --> 30:02.670
Why can't you
just say that

30:02.706 --> 30:04.772
instead of "broken orbital"?

30:04.808 --> 30:05.940
Socket.

30:10.723 --> 30:12.623
Oh, right there.

30:12.658 --> 30:14.745
So, Roy, on the night of
Brandon's death, you spoke

30:14.746 --> 30:16.746
to him on the phone
for over seven minutes.

30:16.781 --> 30:18.347
That's a lot of
talking for somebody

30:18.383 --> 30:21.284
who wasn't talking
to each other.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.653
That was the night Brandon died?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.354
Look, it's not what you think.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.889
It is what
I'm thinking,

30:26.925 --> 30:29.358
'cause I'm thinking
that you lied to us, Roy.

30:29.394 --> 30:31.360
I was embarrassed.
I'd be embarrassed, too.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.829
You just killed
your own son.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.931
I owed a guy money.
A guy?

30:34.966 --> 30:36.666
What kind of guy?
A bookie.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.835
I made a couple of bad bets,
and when he...

30:38.870 --> 30:40.937
he came to collect,
I didn't have the cash.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.472
He roughed me up,

30:42.507 --> 30:43.906
opened up my eye.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.808
So you called your son on
to go get the money?

30:45.844 --> 30:48.744
No, I called an ambulance.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.447
When I didn't have a ride home
from the hospital,

30:51.483 --> 30:53.149
that's when I called Brandon.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.184
Uh...

30:55.220 --> 30:58.254
I didn't have anybody else.

30:58.289 --> 31:01.324
Wait. So not only did you...
did you talk to your son

31:01.359 --> 31:03.138
on the night he died,
but you also saw him?

31:03.162 --> 31:03.827
No.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.863
Look, I told Brandon
what happened,

31:06.898 --> 31:09.966
and he laughed.

31:10.001 --> 31:13.269
Said I was a joke,

31:13.304 --> 31:15.805
he didn't want anything
to do with me.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.644
You want to know why
I didn't have a relationship

31:21.679 --> 31:25.314
with Brandon
for the last ten years?

31:25.350 --> 31:28.084
There you go.

31:30.622 --> 31:31.988
Have you had any success

31:32.023 --> 31:33.689
determining
how the victim was killed?

31:33.725 --> 31:37.793
Determining cause of death
is always a-a difficult task.

31:37.829 --> 31:40.129
However, I am
extremely confident

31:40.165 --> 31:43.533
in... my abilities
and those of my team.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.035
Dr. Brennan, I think
I found something.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.837
Huh.

31:47.872 --> 31:50.106
I actually found it a
couple minutes ago,

31:50.141 --> 31:51.974
but I wanted to time...
I don't care.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.743
What-what is it
you've found?

31:53.778 --> 31:56.179
Well, there appears to be a
perimortem blunt force injury

31:56.214 --> 31:58.247
on the median sacral crest.

31:58.283 --> 32:01.184
Oh. The shape of the "V"
is too wide

32:01.219 --> 32:03.186
to have been caused by a blade.

32:03.221 --> 32:07.156
This is likely caused
by the victim coming

32:07.192 --> 32:09.292
into contact with a...
a sharp corner.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.060
Perhaps he was
shoved into it

32:11.095 --> 32:14.363
during the struggle.
Excellent find, Dr. Vaziri.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.999
Have Dr. Hodgins swab the wound
for particulates.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.869
Would you say you're as close
to the interns as Dr. Brennan?

32:19.904 --> 32:22.972
Nope. Sorry. I see what
you're getting at here,

32:23.007 --> 32:24.574
and it's not gonna happen.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.842
If you'd like to ask me
questions about the case,

32:26.878 --> 32:30.046
I'm happy to help, but like
I said multiple times before,

32:30.081 --> 32:32.181
my personal life is off-limits.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.816
Everything okay in here?

32:33.851 --> 32:36.519
Uh, what is it, Dr. Hodgins?
Mass Spec just came back

32:36.554 --> 32:39.088
with the results
from the bone injury.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.224
This is the Mass Spectrometer.

32:42.727 --> 32:44.193
Mass Spec is only like

32:44.229 --> 32:45.695
the coolest thing
since air conditioning.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.230
This baby here helps me

32:47.265 --> 32:49.098
to identify the type of
chemicals present in the sample

32:49.133 --> 32:50.433
by measuring
the mass-to-charge ratio

32:50.468 --> 32:52.535
and the abundance
of gas-phase ions.

32:52.570 --> 32:55.071
Yeah. I'm thinking
about getting one for the home.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.372
<i>So, the Mass Spec results</i>

32:56.407 --> 32:58.474
show traces
of urethane prepolymers,

32:58.509 --> 33:01.711
diphenylmethane-diisocyanate,
and fish collagen.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.946
So what does that mean,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.415
the victim was beaten
with a fish?

33:06.451 --> 33:08.417
N-No.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.386
Seriously?

33:10.421 --> 33:12.455
Get on with it.

33:12.490 --> 33:16.459
Uh, no, th-these are all
ingredients in-in-in wood glue.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.762
M-Meaning the victim
may have been shoved

33:19.797 --> 33:21.731
into a piece
of wooden furniture?

33:21.766 --> 33:24.400
That or-or, uh, the corner
of a woodworking space.

33:24.435 --> 33:27.436
Okay. I will
notify Booth.

33:27.472 --> 33:30.573
Beaten with a fish?

33:34.579 --> 33:37.280
So, at the time of the victim's
death, guess who had himself

33:37.315 --> 33:39.715
a little business
refurbishing old furniture.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.117
The victim's dad?

33:41.152 --> 33:42.785
Yep. Ran it out
of his garage.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.654
I'm gonna get a warrant,
have the place searched.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.888
Something doesn't add up.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.590
What? What are
you talking about?

33:47.625 --> 33:49.265
It's all adding up.
It's like a math class

33:49.294 --> 33:50.926
how much it's adding up.

33:50.962 --> 33:52.762
Okay. You know what, here's
a guy who was hanging on

33:52.797 --> 33:55.298
to his son's junk
for ten years.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.800
So a dirty old box of CDs makes
you think this guy's innocent?

33:57.835 --> 34:00.002
What I'm thinking is
that this guy still cares.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.304
I mean, why would
he want to...

34:01.339 --> 34:03.105
have a constant reminder
of what he did

34:03.141 --> 34:04.913
just hanging around the house?

34:04.914 --> 34:06.019
So what do you want to do?

34:06.043 --> 34:07.844
I want to take a look
at the father's bookie.

34:07.845 --> 34:10.579
Yeah.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.947
<i>Booth is an intelligent man.</i>

34:12.984 --> 34:15.751
He's in touch with his feelings

34:15.786 --> 34:19.088
and... he trusts those feelings.

34:19.123 --> 34:22.190
It's part of what makes him
exceptional at his job.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.527
<i>But, in my opinion,</i>

34:24.562 --> 34:27.763
<i>feelings are malleable</i>
<i>and easily manipulated.</i>

34:27.799 --> 34:30.666
<i>Booth has formed a connection</i>
<i>with the victim's father</i>

34:30.702 --> 34:33.636
<i>because he, too, has an</i>
<i>addiction to gambling. It's...</i>

34:33.670 --> 34:36.339
<i>it's a struggle</i>
<i>Booth knows all too well.</i>

34:36.373 --> 34:40.342
<i>And because Booth can now see</i>
<i>himself in the victim's father,</i>

34:40.378 --> 34:42.210
<i>he no longer feels the man</i>

34:42.246 --> 34:45.781
<i>would be capable</i>
<i>of killing his own son.</i>

34:45.817 --> 34:49.652
This is why I trust science
over heart.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.821
Science cannot be swayed.

34:51.856 --> 34:56.559
And right now the science
is saying my husband is wrong.

34:58.044 --> 35:02.363
The victim's father mentioned,
uh, owing money to a bookie.

35:02.462 --> 35:05.530
I mean, if that bookie really
wanted his money, I mean,

35:05.565 --> 35:07.832
there's a possibility he may
have gone after the guy's son.

35:07.867 --> 35:09.801
Your wife thinks you're
wasting time on the bookie.

35:09.836 --> 35:10.997
Of course she does.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.905
Up until now, the
Jeffersonian and the FBI

35:12.906 --> 35:14.939
had been working
together pretty smoothly.

35:14.974 --> 35:17.008
Sometimes, you know,
the gut and the brain,

35:17.043 --> 35:19.143
they say-say different things.

35:19.179 --> 35:21.679
By my calculations, the two of
you have analyzed these bones

35:21.714 --> 35:23.681
from head to toe at
least a dozen times.

35:23.716 --> 35:26.684
And we will continue
to analyze them

35:26.719 --> 35:30.054
until we discover how
this young man was murdered.

35:30.089 --> 35:31.656
What if that day
never comes?

35:31.691 --> 35:33.391
That is not possible.

35:33.426 --> 35:36.260
Every time we examine
the remains,

35:36.296 --> 35:39.697
we discover something new.
And that is because

35:39.732 --> 35:42.466
we continuously adjust the way
in which we look at the bones.

35:42.502 --> 35:45.002
With new perspective
comes new insight.

35:45.038 --> 35:47.138
Which means
that it's only a matter of time

35:47.173 --> 35:50.241
before we find
what we're looking for.

36:22.108 --> 36:24.275
Three
faint punctures

36:24.310 --> 36:27.545
on the proximal end
of the victim's left ulna.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.548
The wounds appear to be
equidistantly positioned.

36:30.583 --> 36:31.849
And if you were
to connect the dots,

36:31.885 --> 36:33.517
they'd form a straight line.

36:33.553 --> 36:35.253
The description
of the injuries fits

36:35.288 --> 36:37.822
the edge of a serrated blade.
For a blade

36:37.857 --> 36:39.724
to have created this injury,
it would have first needed

36:39.759 --> 36:42.159
to transect the ulnar artery.

36:42.195 --> 36:45.129
Which would have most likely
caused the victim to bleed out.

36:45.164 --> 36:47.531
We finally found
cause of death.

36:47.567 --> 36:48.866
But we still need to find
the killer.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.668
Have Dr. Hodgins swab for trace.

36:50.703 --> 36:53.704
<i>So, in addition</i>
<i>to the bugs and slime guy,</i>

36:53.740 --> 36:55.540
I'm kind of like the swab guy,
too.

36:55.575 --> 36:57.608
Yeah. Yeah, there are some
that might actually call me

36:57.644 --> 37:00.478
the king of the swabs. Cam,
hey, I'm actually in the process

37:00.513 --> 37:02.480
of examining the results
of the swab as we speak.

37:02.515 --> 37:05.917
And are you finding anything?
Well, there looks to be traces

37:05.952 --> 37:08.824
of maple in the wound,
as well as more wood glue.

37:08.848 --> 37:12.742
Dr. Brennan thinks the injury
was caused by a serrated blade.

37:12.743 --> 37:13.224
So the presence

37:13.259 --> 37:15.059
of wood and wood glue
might suggest

37:15.094 --> 37:17.808
that the actual murder weapon
was a saw blade.

37:17.832 --> 37:18.664
More evidence

37:18.665 --> 37:20.097
pointing towards the father.
Hey, hold on.

37:20.133 --> 37:21.799
There's actually something else,
too.

37:21.834 --> 37:23.334
Um, it's a fiber.

37:23.369 --> 37:25.269
It looks to me
like it's cotton.

37:25.305 --> 37:28.472
There's some blood on it, but,
uh, I can actually make out

37:28.508 --> 37:32.910
a little bit of coloring.
It's green. Like,

37:32.946 --> 37:35.446
bright green.

37:38.518 --> 37:40.751
So, Carl had boxes
of neon green T-shirts

37:40.787 --> 37:42.887
that, uh... in the garage
that he and the victim

37:42.922 --> 37:44.755
were trying to sell.
Which means

37:44.791 --> 37:47.491
the fiber we found in the wound
could have come from anywhere.

37:47.527 --> 37:50.494
Well, according to Carl,
they didn't sell one T-shirt.

37:50.530 --> 37:52.663
They just stayed
in the garage.

37:52.699 --> 37:54.565
You changed your mind
about the shirts, huh?

37:54.600 --> 37:56.567
No, actually, we got
a search warrant

37:56.602 --> 37:58.269
to look through your
garage. Here you go.

37:58.304 --> 38:00.338
What? Why?
Yeah.

38:00.373 --> 38:02.039
I helped you guys.

38:02.075 --> 38:03.774
I told you about Amy.

38:03.810 --> 38:06.577
Did you even talk to her?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

38:06.612 --> 38:08.612
I just... I-I remembered something.
What's that?

38:08.648 --> 38:11.182
Amy, she said...
I remember her saying

38:11.217 --> 38:13.284
that she was...
she wanted to kill him.

38:13.319 --> 38:15.286
She said... very angry, she
said, "I'm gonna kill him."

38:15.321 --> 38:16.687
Booth?
Yeah.

38:16.723 --> 38:18.723
This saw could be
the murder weapon.

38:18.758 --> 38:21.359
The victim could have fallen
into it,

38:21.394 --> 38:24.695
hit his sacral crest
on the cutting table,

38:24.731 --> 38:26.364
and sliced his arm
on the blade.

38:26.399 --> 38:27.965
No way, man.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.267
If you find blood on the saw,

38:30.303 --> 38:32.536
that's from me cutting myself

38:32.572 --> 38:34.638
while-while cutting stuff.

38:34.674 --> 38:36.507
Brandon's ulnar artery
was severed.

38:36.542 --> 38:37.875
There would have been
a lot of blood.

38:37.910 --> 38:39.410
You couldn't have gotten it all.

38:39.445 --> 38:40.945
You do realize that

38:40.980 --> 38:42.947
we are going to tear
that machine apart,

38:42.982 --> 38:44.882
and we're gonna find traces
of blood.

38:44.917 --> 38:47.952
So it's best
you just come clean.

38:57.530 --> 38:59.430
Bloom blamed me

38:59.465 --> 39:01.565
for the shirts
not selling.

39:01.601 --> 39:03.801
He said he wanted his money back

39:03.836 --> 39:06.203
so he could go back to school

39:06.239 --> 39:09.306
and not end up
like his loser dad.

39:09.342 --> 39:11.809
So, rather than give him
his money, you hit him?

39:11.844 --> 39:14.912
With an old tennis racket.

39:14.947 --> 39:17.648
Bloom fell into the saw.

39:17.683 --> 39:21.685
We tried to stop the
bleeding with a shirt,

39:21.721 --> 39:24.855
but there was
just too much.

39:26.159 --> 39:29.760
It was not supposed
to go down like that.

39:31.697 --> 39:34.632
So, just as
I predicted,

39:34.667 --> 39:37.334
the father is innocent.
So in the end,

39:37.370 --> 39:38.903
the gut prevails.

39:38.938 --> 39:41.439
I believe it was the evidence
that prevailed,

39:41.474 --> 39:43.074
seeing as how
it was the evidence

39:43.109 --> 39:45.109
that eventually led us
to the killer.

39:45.144 --> 39:47.011
The evidence you wouldn't
have known what to do with

39:47.046 --> 39:49.313
if it wasn't
for my investigation

39:49.348 --> 39:51.048
uncovering the shirts.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.284
Your investigation would have
been lacking a murder weapon

39:53.319 --> 39:55.519
if it wasn't for my work in the lab.
Okay,

39:55.555 --> 39:57.021
I'll tell you what, we'll go
fifty-fifty on this deal.

39:57.056 --> 39:58.622
No, that would be saying
that our work is equal.

39:58.658 --> 40:01.392
And we both know that
it's the lab that drives

40:01.427 --> 40:03.327
these investigations, Booth.
You're saying

40:03.362 --> 40:04.811
that your work is more
important than my work?

40:04.835 --> 40:06.118
Yes. Obviously.

40:06.119 --> 40:07.682
I'll get that on tape,
'cause it's not true.

40:07.683 --> 40:08.363
It's true.

40:08.367 --> 40:09.238
Okay, Bones, let's stop.
Let's stop right there.

40:09.262 --> 40:10.502
You know it. You've seen it.

40:10.503 --> 40:12.970
So, Emma, what is it you want
to be when you grow up?

40:13.005 --> 40:15.773
I want to be a policeman.

40:15.808 --> 40:17.942
I want to be the mayor of Mars.

40:17.977 --> 40:19.443
I have to think about it.

40:19.479 --> 40:22.613
I want to be a magician
and a doctor.

40:22.648 --> 40:24.315
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be first violin

40:24.350 --> 40:27.084
of the National "Symphosty"
Orchestra.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.086
I want to drive airplane.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.822
I want to be
a forensic anthropologist.

40:31.858 --> 40:35.459
I don't want to be
a forensic anthropologist.
