*

00:11.112 --> 00:12.580
(iPhone unlock sound)

00:12.613 --> 00:15.049
(iPhone lock sound,
puts phone down)

00:17.751 --> 00:19.553
* You were right

00:19.587 --> 00:20.854
(whispers):
Jimmy.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.691
Hey, buddy.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.726
You okay?

00:27.395 --> 00:28.662
Good morning.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.830
About what?

00:29.863 --> 00:33.567
God! Absolutely
blotto last night.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.069
(chuckles)

00:35.103 --> 00:37.405
You... You don't remember
what I told you?

00:37.438 --> 00:38.439
No.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.041
But tell me again.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.510
Okay, seriously, dude.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.445
I think you might have
a drinking problem.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.747
Like, you need to go
to church basements and shit.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.383
Oh, my God.
Okay, um...

00:49.417 --> 00:51.619
(inhales)

00:51.652 --> 00:55.323
I am... so sorry,
but, uh...

00:57.825 --> 00:59.960
Sweetheart,
your dad died.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.798
What?

01:04.832 --> 01:06.100
Papa?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.601
Oh, my God.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.903
I know. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.574
I... I don't know what to say.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.455
*

01:39.133 --> 01:40.768
(exhales)

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
Do you want to talk about it?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.740
Ha!

01:46.774 --> 01:48.676
I was kidding.
I totally remembered.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.110
Wait... what?

01:50.144 --> 01:51.145
You knew?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.646
Yeah. You told me last night.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.981
You're not getting
that one back.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.484
I stole one, dummy.
Jimmy!

01:56.517 --> 01:59.687
You do not need
to steal blow jobs.
Yeah, but

01:59.720 --> 02:01.789
you know how amazing
free food tastes.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.691
(urinating)

02:03.724 --> 02:05.293
(toilet flushes)
Seriously, are you okay?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.195
Your dad died.
That's a big deal.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.630
Yes, I am absolutely fine.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.499
I feel... nothing about it.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.301
Really?
Yeah.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.636
Great!

02:15.669 --> 02:18.005
Oh. Phew! Thank
God that's over.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.475
Huh? Hey, do you want to do, uh,
one of those Korean gel masks?

02:21.509 --> 02:24.645
Not really.
I got a snail one.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.448
It's supposed to be extra goopy.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.149
Huh.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.957
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:36.990 --> 02:39.693
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:39.727 --> 02:43.030
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:50.571 --> 02:54.875
I made my special
heart pancakes,

02:54.908 --> 02:56.744
because we love you, Jimmy.

02:56.777 --> 03:00.013
We really do.
What kind of
jank-ass hearts are these?

03:00.047 --> 03:01.549
That one looks like a butt.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.551
Sorry. It was...
it was kind of a rough night.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.653
Uh, but later this afternoon,
I'm finally gonna have

03:05.686 --> 03:07.921
my consultation with
the chief of staff at the VA.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.990
Yeah, chiefs'll do that
sometimes.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.160
Hey, can I get some sticky sauce
for these pan-butts or what?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.562
Do you know,
I actually just

03:14.595 --> 03:16.997
read something
interesting about PTSD?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.600
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it turns out
in World War I,

03:19.633 --> 03:22.236
the official term for
"PTSD" was "cowardice,"

03:22.270 --> 03:24.505
and you were
shot for it.
That is interesting.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.039
LINDSAY:
How are you holding up, Jimmy?

03:26.073 --> 03:27.741
My guinea pig died.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.244
I couldn't jack off
for, like, half a day.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.779
I'm telling you
guys-- false alarm.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.247
He truly doesn't
give a shit.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.182
Look, when a relationship

03:35.215 --> 03:38.852
has been virtually non-existent
for 33 years,

03:38.886 --> 03:41.255
we're not talking
about a major tectonic shift.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.056
Nothing has changed.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.759
I still have exactly
zero off-track bettors

03:45.793 --> 03:47.595
with IBS in my daily life.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.530
I almost wish I knew
more dead people.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.266
I think funerals are hella sexy.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.302
All right, everybody out.
I have work to do.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.136
Wait!

03:56.169 --> 03:59.206
Jimmy's dad died,
and he doesn't care.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.310
Yes?
I'm going to have a baby.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.211
JIMMY:
What's happening?
Is Lindsay

04:04.244 --> 04:06.046
processing thought?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.616
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.
And when I'm old,

04:08.649 --> 04:13.554
my kid will have a feeling
about me dying.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.888
(whispering):
Oh, my God, she's doing it.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.458
I want my kids to be sad
when I die.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.060
Yes?
So I need to be

04:20.093 --> 04:22.229
a good... a good...

04:22.262 --> 04:24.031
This is really happening.
a good...

04:25.198 --> 04:26.567
(sighs)

04:26.600 --> 04:27.835
...dad.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.504
Aah! It almost had it.
Oh.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.106
I should probably sign up
for one of those stupid

04:33.140 --> 04:35.075
classes Becca's always
yammering about.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.444
Edgar? Edgar?

04:36.477 --> 04:37.911
Uh, yeah. What's up?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.813
Big writing day ahead
of me. I need you to get

04:39.847 --> 04:42.816
all my usual writing snacks from
the British specialty store.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.652
Shrimp-flavored crisps,

04:44.685 --> 04:46.620
Wallenger's choco-knockers,
tartar biscuits,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.121
and then all your
standard candies--

04:48.155 --> 04:50.290
lemingtons, fluffingtons,
rum Christophers,

04:50.324 --> 04:51.959
salted licorice knib knobs.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.527
I'm not mad, Felix.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.763
No, and when you constantly
accuse me of being mad,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.466
you deny my right of actually
being goddamn mad at you.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.868
No, I'm not "therapizing" you,
all right?

05:00.901 --> 05:02.269
Stop saying that.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
Holy shit.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.839
I-I'll call you later.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.476
What's up? Give me a cigarette.
Who was that?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.644
What that your shitty boyfriend
with his cargo shorts?

05:10.678 --> 05:12.045
None of your business.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.214
(grunts)

05:14.247 --> 05:16.316
What's going on?

05:16.350 --> 05:20.521
So, I told Jimmy his dad died,
like you told me to, and he said

05:20.554 --> 05:23.023
that he feels nothing,
and then he stole a beej,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.325
which is a pretty good
heckle, actually.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.960
Is there a question?
Nope.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.297
I just wanted you to know
that you were wrong.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.000
You were wrong.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.302
Jimmy can say he's
fine all he wants,

05:35.335 --> 05:38.038
but sooner or later, his
dad's death is gonna hit him,

05:38.071 --> 05:41.041
and when it does, you're gonna
have to be there for him.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.077
When? We're going
on a rad cruise.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.980
Are you saying this could
come out on the rad cruise?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.349
Sure. Yes, it could
happen on the rad cruise.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.852
(clears throat)
What's the rad cruise?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.555
No, I don't want to know.
I mean, I do want to...

05:54.588 --> 05:57.691
Never mind.
So you're telling me

05:57.725 --> 06:00.728
I need to help him
get it all out now,

06:00.761 --> 06:02.896
just pop it like a pimple.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.365
No, that is not how humans work.
Yeah, I get it.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.368
Get him to cry, boo-hoo, there,
there, we'll be done by Wheel.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.272
Of Fortune.
Seven years in school? Really?

06:12.305 --> 06:15.843
Gretchen, Jimmy has got to go
through his grieving process.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.377
All right?

06:17.411 --> 06:19.580
It's not gonna happen
on your exact schedule.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.049
Eh. I think
I'm gonna do it my way.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.684
Thanks for nothing.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.118
(clears throat)

06:25.152 --> 06:27.220
(whispers):
Your boyfriend... sucks.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.623
Sucks.

06:31.625 --> 06:35.062
Simon's sisters and Kitty
sprawled on the carpet,

06:35.095 --> 06:38.198
watching Top of the Pops,
their bums in the air.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.968
From his perch on the coach,
Simon noted

06:41.001 --> 06:44.371
that while Cynthia and Patsy
had gotten quite porcine,

06:44.404 --> 06:47.641
Kitty's bottom had
an almost otherworldly lift,

06:47.675 --> 06:50.578
as if in the process
of being raptured

06:50.611 --> 06:54.147
for being too perfect to dwell
any longer on Earth.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.650
(yells in frustration)

06:56.684 --> 06:58.919
Goddamn it!

06:58.952 --> 07:00.488
What's wrong with me?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.289
It's been hours,

07:02.322 --> 07:04.492
and I still haven't perfected
the bum metaphor.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.727
My fingers hurt.
My dad died.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.763
At least you know where he is.
Edgar, I need sustenance.
Where are my snacks?

07:09.797 --> 07:12.566
Uh, sorry, Jimmy. There was some
police activity near the store.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.502
That's my last food!

07:14.535 --> 07:16.136
I've been thinking
about it all day,

07:16.169 --> 07:18.906
and you really need to cry,
Jimmy. My therapist says

07:18.939 --> 07:20.941
it's very...
Gretchen the sheer breadth

07:20.974 --> 07:24.444
of my labyrinthian abstruse
psychological composition

07:24.478 --> 07:26.780
cannot possibly be
second-handedly grasped

07:26.814 --> 07:30.183
by some Long Beach
Community College graduate

07:30.217 --> 07:32.920
who deals with the...
tragically maladroit all day.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.321
No offense.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.790
None taken,
because I do not know that word.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.425
Just give me
the afternoon.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.160
We'll do some super-sad shit,

07:40.193 --> 07:42.630
you'll poop out some tears
and we'll be home by Wheel.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.165
BOTH:
...of Fortune.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.672
It won't work. I feel nothing!

07:51.705 --> 07:54.608
But fine. Let's go.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.376
Work day's already a disaster.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.111
I don't know why
I'm suddenly blocked.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.014
I'm rewriting the same paragraph
over and over.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.349
Hey,

08:02.382 --> 08:04.151
Killswitch, while I'm out,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.353
copy edit the chapter where
Simon watches Kitty bathe

08:06.386 --> 08:07.721
after the trip-hop concert.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.356
Oh, and for the love of God,

08:09.389 --> 08:12.259
finally learn how to spell
"analingus," will you?!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.529
You never say "thank you."

08:15.563 --> 08:18.699
That's what the money's for!

08:32.212 --> 08:35.182
I'm so glad we're gonna
learn how to be a family.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.483
Family.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.151
But we're already a family.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.321
You can't just have two
people in a family, Paul.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.490
Name one family
that's two people.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.392
Gilmore Girls.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.394
We have to learn how
to be good parents,

08:47.427 --> 08:51.064
so that when we're old,
they'll take good care of us.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.366
Plus, you're so
accident-prone.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.703
You turned into my knife,
and it's taken, like,

08:55.736 --> 08:58.038
forever for your skin
to grow back together.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.206
You mean heal?

08:59.239 --> 09:01.208
Dogs heel, Paul.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.976
Men get strong.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.913
Nerds!
Oh, my God.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.181
I still can't believe
you're keeping it.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.250
(laughing):
Oh, Rebecca,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.753
you josher.
(laughing)
(chuckling)

09:12.786 --> 09:15.623
Such a bummer
about the timing though.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.357
By the time
it comes flopping out,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.426
our entire family's
gonna be so babied out,

09:19.459 --> 09:22.529
your poor little lump's
not gonna get any attention.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.465
You're just mad
I didn't get all fat like you.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.534
You're barely pregnant.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.070
Yo, dingus, help me gaffle
some of these brews.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.305
Becca's being a cooze
and doesn't want me to drink

09:32.339 --> 09:33.974
so I actually pay attention.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.410
Anyway, pretend like you got
to go drop a dook,

09:37.444 --> 09:38.979
grab, like,
four of them dummies,

09:39.012 --> 09:40.480
leave 'em in the toilet tank
for me,

09:40.513 --> 09:42.082
Godfather-style.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.317
Nothing gets this pimp
through a dumb baby class

09:44.351 --> 09:45.619
like toilet beer.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.055
Hello, mommies and daddies.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.557
So, last week we covered
birth plans and how

09:50.590 --> 09:52.760
pretty much everyone poops
during labor.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.929
So today we're gonna practice
some real-life skills.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.598
Everybody come
and grab a baby doll. Come on.

09:58.632 --> 10:02.335
* Snuggle wuggle

10:02.369 --> 10:05.673
* Snuggle wuggle,
snuggle wuggle, snuggle wuggle *

10:05.706 --> 10:08.275
* Snuggle wuggle

10:08.308 --> 10:10.944
Emotions are dangerous,
Gretchen. Think about it,

10:10.978 --> 10:12.946
the most emotional
movie characters

10:12.980 --> 10:15.849
always die.
Kane from Citizen Kane.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.617
The wife from Up.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.988
Table-dancing destitute on
the bottom deck of the Titanic.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.123
And the ones
who survive in movies:

10:23.156 --> 10:25.859
RoboCop, Terminator,

10:25.893 --> 10:28.295
Chappie.
Those are all robots.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.963
Yeah, exactly. No emotions.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.933
Just cold circuitry
and a thirst for revenge.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.334
I don't really know
why you guys insist

10:34.367 --> 10:36.003
on sitting in
the backseat.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.437
I'm not an Uber.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.606
Yeah, damn right
you're not.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.440
(keys clacking)
What's that?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.842
His rating.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.176
(chime)

10:43.210 --> 10:46.346
(grunts)
One star.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.315
(sighs)

10:48.348 --> 10:51.451
Oh, almost forgot.
Give us your car booze.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.721
Guys, I really have to get
to my VA appointment.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.723
(whimpers)
(groans)
Fine.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.624
But when you're done
with your stupid thing,

10:57.657 --> 10:58.859
you're giving us a ride home.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.029
(starts engine)

11:04.932 --> 11:06.900
Come on.
A little wah-wah,

11:06.934 --> 11:09.236
death is sad, and
then you're done.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.171
Pretend one of these
is your dad's grave.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.406
Yeah, the problem is
death doesn't bother me.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.675
I'm not upset
by the inevitable.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.677
It's like being upset
by the weather

11:17.711 --> 11:20.247
or by an Irishman
proving untrustworthy.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.849
(gasps)
Look.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.584
Real live dead person.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.755
Come on. Maybe it'll
stir something up.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.057
MINISTER:
...with so many questions
and so few answers.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.591
(quietly):
Hi. Sorry.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.026
But it would be a mistake
to think of today

11:33.060 --> 11:34.427
as a sad day.
(crying)

11:34.461 --> 11:35.695
Charlotte, if you would
please step forward.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.902
Our Father,
who art in heaven...

11:41.935 --> 11:45.672
Jimmy, am I...
Jimmy, am I crazy

11:45.705 --> 11:48.675
or is this funeral
hella sexy?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.678
I don't know
where that fetish came from,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.613
but it is absolutely...

11:56.984 --> 11:58.418
MINISTER:
...lead us not
into temptation...

11:58.451 --> 11:59.953
Oh, my God,
you're right.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.623
It's like the funeral
from November Rain.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.458
*

12:05.492 --> 12:07.727
(both moaning)

12:07.761 --> 12:10.964
Wait! Make sure to pull
out. I can't get pregnant.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.966
Your dad might be
floating around right now,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.601
looking for a body
to reincarnate.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.304
That's a good call.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.906
(panting)
(moaning)

12:18.939 --> 12:21.608
(birds chirping,
panting and moaning continue)

12:21.641 --> 12:24.011
*

12:30.117 --> 12:32.886
Um... too hard.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.255
* Berlin, Berlin

12:35.288 --> 12:39.259
* She shines
like a mirror ball *
(speaking indistinctly)

12:39.292 --> 12:42.462
* A hot day, protégé

12:42.495 --> 12:43.997
(speaks indistinctly)

12:44.031 --> 12:47.000
* She swings herself
around the pole slow *

12:47.034 --> 12:51.071
* She slips out
of a prom dress *

12:51.104 --> 12:55.308
* And all the ladies
wanna be her *

12:55.342 --> 12:59.512
* And all the grown men
wanna cry *

12:59.546 --> 13:03.951
* But then
I only wanna kiss you *

13:03.984 --> 13:07.187
* Just once, maybe

13:07.220 --> 13:10.423
* Twice

13:10.457 --> 13:14.261
* And I could show you
the town *

13:14.294 --> 13:18.265
* If I knew where to begin

13:18.298 --> 13:22.769
* And I could show you out

13:22.802 --> 13:24.671
* If I wasn't on my way in

13:24.704 --> 13:26.339
Oh! Yes!
(baby cries, others cheering)

13:26.373 --> 13:29.276
* But Berlin,
she ain't the kind of woman... *

13:29.309 --> 13:30.777
It's not real!

13:30.810 --> 13:33.113
It's not a real baby!

13:33.146 --> 13:34.547
Thank you.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.350
Okay, we got a little
distracted at that last place.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.053
But this is it:
living fathers

13:40.087 --> 13:42.022
with their kids.
That is some straight-up

13:42.055 --> 13:44.524
"Cat's in the Cradle" shit
right there. Plus,

13:44.557 --> 13:46.393
look at my dope maze.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.229
Usually, I'm a master
of all art forms--

13:49.262 --> 13:51.231
writing, music, quips,

13:51.264 --> 13:52.900
mixed media collage--

13:52.933 --> 13:56.203
but, for some reason,
I am creatively blocked.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.272
A sun wearing sunglasses.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.509
Doesn't even make sense.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.744
He's too bright
for his own eyes?

14:04.777 --> 14:07.080
It's because you need
to cry it out.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.082
Maybe you're right.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.750
MAN:
Jesus Christ.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.921
I don't even know what
to do with you anymore!

14:15.422 --> 14:17.324
And... jackpot.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.758
Go. Follow him.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.593
Maybe he'll rage-kick
a garbage can,

14:20.627 --> 14:22.062
remind you of your dad. Go.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.830
All right.
(clears throat)

14:23.863 --> 14:26.099
I will give it a go.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.569
(bell jingles)

14:29.602 --> 14:32.605
Hey. What you
workin' on, buddy?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.578
Parenting, right?

14:38.611 --> 14:40.080
I don't know
what to do, man.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.448
Mm.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.417
It's hard to communicate
with them, yeah?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.519
Like you don't even recognize
yourself in them.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.620
I don't.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.888
You're frustrated

14:48.922 --> 14:50.890
because he's a little clumsy,

14:50.924 --> 14:53.560
a little too artsy-fartsy,

14:53.593 --> 14:57.064
because he broke a blood vessel
in his eye crying at My Girl.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.066
What? No.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.134
He's legitimately a bad person.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.303
Like, my son
is an awful human being.

15:03.336 --> 15:07.074
What?
He set up a bunch of Facebook
accounts to cyberbully me.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.909
Hey, this bitch
is bothering me.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.045
You trying to hit
on my dad, twink?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.381
Jimmy, turns out
this kid sucks.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.083
You suck! What
kind of adults go

15:16.116 --> 15:18.285
to a paint-your-own-pottery
place anyway?

15:18.318 --> 15:19.919
Nasty-ass
pedophiles.

15:19.953 --> 15:24.091
(laughs)
Oh, shit!
(chuckles)

15:24.124 --> 15:25.758
Don't go...
Shut up, Greg.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.327
I wish you would call me Dad.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.963
Well, I wish you'd
suck my dick.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.001
Oh, hey,
emotion check.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.804
Actually, I think
I felt something that time.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.073
Really?! Jimmy!

15:40.107 --> 15:42.142
We're thawing
your cold, dead heart.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.911
Hurry up! We got one more stop
on the sadness tour.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.413
Okay. Let me call an Edgar.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.415
(sighs)

15:48.448 --> 15:49.616
(line ringing)

15:49.649 --> 15:51.351
We're ready to go.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.121
And I sincerely hope
you've got our car booze.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.623
Sorry, Jimmy, I can't come.
My car broke down.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.191
Oh, well, that's not a surprise.

15:58.225 --> 16:02.329
Piece of shit with
no auxiliary plug or car booze!

16:12.739 --> 16:13.673
All right.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.650
Great job.
Here's a Sophie giraffe

16:23.683 --> 16:25.852
for winning
the skills section.
(gasps)

16:25.885 --> 16:27.687
(chuckles)

16:27.720 --> 16:29.889
Oh. No, that's...
(squeaking)

16:29.922 --> 16:31.824
Okay.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.027
(gasps)
I won a prize.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.495
You're such a natural mommy.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.964
One of the dads just
told me the neatest thing:

16:37.997 --> 16:39.466
babies are programmed

16:39.499 --> 16:41.568
to look like the father
when they're born.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.170
Won't that be
so adorable?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.505
A tiny little me suckling
at your bosom?

16:45.538 --> 16:48.108
Wah, wah.
(suckling sounds)

16:49.442 --> 16:52.412
Linds...
(clears throat)

16:52.445 --> 16:55.748
that was actually quite...
impressive.

16:55.782 --> 16:59.752
I can't believe I'm actually
saying this, but I think...

16:59.786 --> 17:01.921
you were born to be a mom.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.423
Thanks, Bec.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.524
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
VERNON:
Uh-oh!

17:04.557 --> 17:05.525
There's something's wrong

17:05.558 --> 17:07.194
with my big ol' honkers!

17:07.227 --> 17:09.762
Ah! No leche!

17:09.796 --> 17:12.832
Glug, glug, glug,
glug, glug.
Oh. This poor dear.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.934
He is so delirious
from working

17:14.967 --> 17:17.504
so many double shifts.
Paul, will you drive us home?
Ooh...

17:17.537 --> 17:20.073
Of course. See
you at home, Mama?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.241
Sure, Pap...

17:21.274 --> 17:23.410
Paul.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.846
Um, hi,
what is this?

17:26.879 --> 17:29.082
What do I look like,
some baby lady?

17:29.116 --> 17:32.952
I'm sorry. M-My wife,
she's stuck at work-- shocker.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.255
She gave me this
shopping list, and,

17:35.288 --> 17:37.724
man, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.792
Oh. Okay.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.628
Mm.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.063
Looks like you're gonna need
a Miracle Blanket, a Woombie,

17:44.097 --> 17:46.466
a Boppy-- really great
neck support--
Yeah...

17:46.499 --> 17:49.702
and, of course,
Zipadee-Zip.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.771
It'll be quicker
if I just do it.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.241
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.309
JIMMY:
Well, Gretchen, you did it.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.479
I can't think of a place
more gloomy, more soul-crushing,

17:59.512 --> 18:02.715
more quintessentially
England.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.619
(bad British accent):
Yeah, I thought you might want
a wee English breakfast.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.821
Excuse me?
Don't be a berk.

18:08.855 --> 18:12.592
You know what I'm talkin' about,
Shitty Jimmy.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.994
Are you being Ronny?
(American accent):
Today's been all abstract.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.463
It's time to personalize it.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.898
I even boned up
on some British slang online.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.634
(British accent): Blarmy!
Knob jockeys getting married?!

18:21.668 --> 18:24.070
Next thing you know,
some ringburner's

18:24.103 --> 18:26.072
gonna want to shag
and marry his dachshund!

18:26.105 --> 18:27.607
(shuddering):
Oh.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.976
Almost felt something again.
Get more personal.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.412
Uh, talk about my
ceramic pony collection

18:32.445 --> 18:34.414
or the time Fiona caught me
kissing a magazine cover

18:34.447 --> 18:36.516
of Boy George because I thought
he was a girl.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.818
Look at 'at pasty skin.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.821
Them soft girl hands.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.323
The poofy scrote

18:43.356 --> 18:46.326
never worked an honest day
in his whole miserable,

18:46.359 --> 18:47.827
sodding life.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.198
Now, you listen to me,
you fat, grey void.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.201
Writing is hard!
It is actual work.

18:54.234 --> 18:58.104
It's a noble, nay, spiritual
endeavor that taxes

18:58.137 --> 19:00.673
both the brain... Oh, my God.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.510
This wretched idea of yours
might actually be working.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.879
The feeling? It's back.
Yeah, it's coming.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.982
Oh, my God.
Here it comes.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.754
(farting)

19:16.223 --> 19:18.225
That was the feeling? A fart?

19:18.258 --> 19:21.294
Mm. Apparently.
Well, I told you,

19:21.328 --> 19:22.962
I'm very evolved.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.298
Stupid therapist.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.799
I'm warning you,
this better be it.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.301
If you lose your shit
on the cruise

19:28.335 --> 19:30.303
and ruin my time
with Cotton Candy Raccoon,

19:30.337 --> 19:32.305
Bubble Gecko, or Sneezy Panda,

19:32.339 --> 19:36.243
I... Well, she died in
a plane crash. But never mind.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.680
How do you even
mess up toast?

19:40.713 --> 19:41.948
(sputtering)

19:45.184 --> 19:47.153
Thanks so much for helping.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.323
Jesus, I'm already
this overwhelmed.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.559
I don't even
have a baby yet.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.661
How are you this good at it
already?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.330
I have no idea.
(chuckles)

19:57.364 --> 20:00.166
So now what? I'm just stuck
doing this baby shit

20:00.199 --> 20:02.001
for the rest of my life?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.070
What if there are
other things I'm meant to be

20:04.103 --> 20:05.905
and I never find out?

20:05.938 --> 20:09.842
Like a phlebologist
or a dinosaur?
(chuckles)

20:09.876 --> 20:12.245
Once my ex and I split,

20:12.279 --> 20:15.582
I figured that was it.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.584
I was never gonna be a dad.

20:17.617 --> 20:21.454
Then I meet this cute Asian
chick at the Kubrick exhibit

20:21.488 --> 20:24.457
at LACMA and suddenly
she's knocked up

20:24.491 --> 20:29.462
and I get this
second chance at 42.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.564
So you believe
in second chances?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.065
I didn't.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.902
But I guess I do now.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.639
(chuckles)

20:44.143 --> 20:47.647
Oh, Jesus. What the hell are
you doing? Are you insane?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.783
I just told you, I'm
on my second chance!

20:50.817 --> 20:54.421
I just thought...
Oh, my God! What
is wrong with you?!

20:54.454 --> 20:56.923
Why would you even do that?
I talked to your husband!
Shh. Okay.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.258
He was so nice. We're going
kayaking together sometime!
Fine.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.995
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
This isn't a singles bar
where you just pick up guys!

21:03.029 --> 21:05.097
You're having a baby,
you weirdo!
Shut up, shut up,

21:05.131 --> 21:05.965
shut up.

21:05.998 --> 21:06.966
Shut up.

21:06.999 --> 21:10.036
(squeaking)
Shut up.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.074
(whimpering)
(squeaks)

21:15.107 --> 21:17.810
(door opens, closes)

21:28.287 --> 21:30.457
(door closes)
(Gretchen gasps)

21:30.490 --> 21:32.058
I got your snacks.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.928
(sighs)
It's too late.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.365
I've already lost an
entire day's writing.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.467
Sorry, literature.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.137
Mmm, rum Christophers.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.574
They're so disgusting.
I can't stop eating them.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.180
Hey, how was your thing today?

21:54.213 --> 21:55.181
Fine.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.684
Do you want to talk about it?

21:57.717 --> 21:58.818
No.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.020
Yes. Two for two.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.423
(rapid footfalls)

22:08.728 --> 22:11.664
(sighs)

22:25.378 --> 22:28.114
(sighs)

22:31.350 --> 22:35.154
Well, Dad, here we are,

22:35.187 --> 22:37.690
the final test.

22:44.296 --> 22:47.299
(inhales deeply)

22:51.137 --> 22:53.540
*

23:02.381 --> 23:04.751
That's it.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.253
Get it out.

23:07.286 --> 23:10.289
Let all the sadness out.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.593
Whoa! I thought
you were crying!
No!

23:13.626 --> 23:16.596
It's amazing. I was smelling
the jacket that Dad left,

23:16.629 --> 23:18.364
and it smells exactly like him--

23:18.397 --> 23:20.132
just cigarettes, ale,

23:20.166 --> 23:22.234
beans, occupational failure.

23:22.268 --> 23:25.772
And in a rush, that feeling that
we'd been searching for all day

23:25.805 --> 23:27.073
just came
flying out.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.341
And, Gretchen,
it wasn't sadness.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.644
It was happiness.

23:32.579 --> 23:33.780
I'm free.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.449
I am finally free!

23:36.483 --> 23:39.285
And I'm finally unstuck
creatively.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.387
I found, all right,
the perfect metaphor

23:41.420 --> 23:43.890
for the heft
of Kitty's adolescent bottom.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.626
I'll tell you later.
It's-it's too sexy.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.628
(exhales)
Do you want to go, uh,

23:48.661 --> 23:51.397
binge-watch that six-part series
on the Susan Smith case?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.733
Yeah. Just a sec.
Now that my parental nightmare

23:53.766 --> 23:57.770
is finally over, I'm gonna get
rid of everything that smacks

23:57.804 --> 23:59.405
of Ronny Overly.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.574
May he rest in relative peace

24:01.608 --> 24:03.409
for someone of his arterial

24:03.442 --> 24:05.878
calcification.

24:07.814 --> 24:11.484
* I wouldn't feel so uncertain

24:11.518 --> 24:12.752
*

24:12.785 --> 24:17.690
* I wouldn't feel so uncertain

24:17.724 --> 24:20.827
* That when your body
hit the earth *

24:22.394 --> 24:25.732
* It opened up
and swallowed you *

24:27.834 --> 24:31.370
* She kept you safe
in her heart's center *

24:31.403 --> 24:34.607
* And always tucked you in
at night *

24:34.641 --> 24:37.777
*

24:37.810 --> 24:40.212
* When you woke up nervous

24:41.914 --> 24:43.783
* She said, "Baby, you're..."

24:43.816 --> 24:46.753
(dog barks)

24:49.856 --> 24:52.759
