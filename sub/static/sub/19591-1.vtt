50:29.145 --> 50:31.064
Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke?

50:31.147 --> 50:34.150
Uh... Well, I'm a nursing assistant.

50:35.944 --> 50:39.197
Now, suppose I came down
to where you do that...

50:39.781 --> 50:41.282
Your hospital...

50:41.366 --> 50:42.992
It's a post-op facility.

50:43.618 --> 50:44.994
Okay.

50:45.078 --> 50:48.414
Well, suppose I came down there
and I said, “You know,

50:48.498 --> 50:50.667
maybe not that medication, Ruth,

50:50.750 --> 50:53.795
maybe this one instead, don't ya think?”

50:53.878 --> 50:55.505
No, that's what...

50:56.631 --> 50:58.132
That's not what I meant by...

50:58.216 --> 51:00.593
You present a certainty

51:00.677 --> 51:05.098
that the owner of a vehicle
you happened to see at a garage sale

51:05.181 --> 51:08.977
is the same individual
who burglarized your home.

51:09.060 --> 51:10.228
- And...
- His footprint.

51:10.311 --> 51:12.814
And that his foot,

51:12.897 --> 51:14.440
according to this,

51:14.524 --> 51:16.859
is made out of scrambled eggs.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.654
No. Uh, no, sir.

51:19.737 --> 51:21.239
That is not... Okay.

51:21.322 --> 51:22.322
So...

51:24.117 --> 51:26.703
I... [clears throat]
I located my computer...

51:26.786 --> 51:30.790
Right. I-I understand the chain of events
as you tell them.

51:30.873 --> 51:31.708
Okay.

51:31.791 --> 51:35.086
Did it not occur to you that the people
who had your computer in the first place

51:35.169 --> 51:36.754
were the same ones
that broke into your home?

51:36.838 --> 51:39.716
- Yeah. But...
- Occam's Razor and whatnot.

51:39.799 --> 51:40.633
What?

51:40.717 --> 51:45.346
Did it not occur to you that approaching a
criminal suspect without official capacity

51:45.430 --> 51:48.182
is a good way to get your wig knocked off?

51:50.935 --> 51:52.645
Let me see your hand.

51:54.439 --> 51:56.482
- Can I see it?
- It's nothing.

51:56.566 --> 51:58.192
Can I see it?

51:58.276 --> 51:59.986
That's what I thought. Yeah.

52:00.069 --> 52:01.696
What happened to your finger?

52:03.781 --> 52:05.283
Ruth, look at me.

52:05.867 --> 52:09.454
- Were you engaged in a confrontation?
- No, it was an accident.

52:11.622 --> 52:15.084
Have you been able
to replace your medications?

52:15.168 --> 52:17.962
- I see. I see.
- I'll take that as a no.

52:18.046 --> 52:19.547
Okay.

52:22.842 --> 52:24.761
[scoffs]

52:24.844 --> 52:27.096
I mean, why...?

52:27.180 --> 52:30.099
Why do you not want to help me?

52:30.183 --> 52:32.602
- Help you?
- Yeah. I just... Why...?

52:33.186 --> 52:35.563
- Isn't it your job?
- My job.

52:35.646 --> 52:36.646
Yeah.

52:36.981 --> 52:39.192
I am doing my job.

52:39.942 --> 52:41.944
You're asking me about my job right now.

52:42.028 --> 52:44.113
- Yeah, I'm coming in here...
- You come into my workplace...

52:44.197 --> 52:46.908
- I have things to help you...
- and you ask me about my job.

52:46.991 --> 52:49.285
You think just because
you left your door wide open

52:49.368 --> 52:51.537
for some punk to stroll right in,

52:51.621 --> 52:54.123
that the universe now somehow
revolves around you?

52:54.207 --> 52:55.208
Well, grow up.

52:55.291 --> 52:57.960
We had a man beaten unconscious
in his driveway.

52:58.044 --> 53:00.171
- That's awful.
- Yeah, it's awful.

53:00.254 --> 53:04.884
And now... now, Ruth,
he has skull fragments in his brain.

53:05.843 --> 53:07.553
The world is bigger than your silverware.

53:07.637 --> 53:10.264
People are experiencing bigger problems.

53:10.348 --> 53:12.183
There are people out there...

53:14.310 --> 53:16.896
[crying quietly]

53:16.979 --> 53:18.981
[sighs, panting]

53:20.149 --> 53:21.400
I'm, uh...

53:24.987 --> 53:26.739
I'm being divorced.

53:27.824 --> 53:29.659
First time I said it out loud.

53:31.744 --> 53:33.121
Sir, I'm very...

53:33.204 --> 53:36.415
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Move it. Move the hand.

53:38.543 --> 53:39.752
Go home, Ruth.

53:43.422 --> 53:45.508
This is the guy.

53:45.591 --> 53:48.136
No, it is not.

53:49.303 --> 53:54.308
And if you engage in vigilante action
or mess around with this again,

53:54.392 --> 53:57.103
I will be a bigger problem
than your busted finger.

53:58.855 --> 54:00.857
Do you follow me?

54:02.191 --> 54:06.612
[stereo plays loud dance music]

54:07.947 --> 54:09.365
[volume lowers]

54:19.876 --> 54:21.544
[exhales]

54:21.627 --> 54:23.254
What now?

54:28.509 --> 54:30.261
Pick your shit up.

54:35.433 --> 54:36.934
Excuse me.

55:04.462 --> 55:06.631
Must've robbed a ton of houses.

55:15.514 --> 55:17.016
[car door closes]

55:27.860 --> 55:30.655
[doorbell rings]

55:31.906 --> 55:33.908
[laughing]

55:33.991 --> 55:36.494
Oh, excuse me. I just was...

55:38.037 --> 55:40.289
- Good morning, ma'am. I...
- Police.

55:41.457 --> 55:44.377
Okay. May we have a moment of your time?

55:46.087 --> 55:48.005
Well, I don't see why not.

55:49.090 --> 55:50.633
[laughs]

55:50.716 --> 55:52.593
Come on in.

55:52.677 --> 55:55.554
Welcome to my home.
Make yourselves comfortable.

55:55.638 --> 55:58.474
Go on in the sittin' room,
sit on one of those couches.

55:58.849 --> 56:00.476
They're kinda new.
They're real comfortable.

56:00.559 --> 56:02.645
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- Not necessary.

56:02.728 --> 56:04.522
Um, no, thank you.

56:04.605 --> 56:07.650
It's no trouble. I just press a button
on the machine... boop!

56:07.733 --> 56:11.570
It'll make a cappuccino too.
It's like AI, like a spaceship.

56:11.654 --> 56:13.948
- Do you have cashew milk?
- In that case...

56:14.031 --> 56:16.033
I think I can find something.

56:18.577 --> 56:22.164
[sighs] Any kind of nut milk is good?

56:22.248 --> 56:23.958
I like nut milk.

56:24.041 --> 56:26.043
You know, my niece Cameron,
she can't have dairy,

56:26.127 --> 56:29.422
so I always have, like, hazelnut milk or...

56:30.006 --> 56:32.216
You know,
they do this Brazil nut thing now.

56:32.300 --> 56:34.260
It's actually pretty good.

56:34.677 --> 56:37.430
I need to speak with Christian Rumack.

56:37.513 --> 56:39.265
- Is he here?
- [laughs]

56:39.348 --> 56:43.352
Well, he is still out with his friends.

56:43.936 --> 56:47.148
I expect him back God knows when.
Talk about what?

56:49.608 --> 56:51.152
Choices he made.

56:51.652 --> 56:53.237
[snorting laugh]

56:53.321 --> 56:58.200
Well, I ought to make sandwiches then
because that could take all day.

56:58.951 --> 57:00.578
Like sandwiches?

57:02.371 --> 57:03.789
You hungry?

57:04.999 --> 57:06.459
I'm never hungry.

57:07.877 --> 57:11.922
I used to get hungry a lot,
but I don't really get hungry anymore.

57:12.506 --> 57:15.134
Okay, here we go.

57:15.760 --> 57:18.095
Here you go, sweetie, with that nut milk.

57:19.221 --> 57:20.640
Thank you.

57:20.723 --> 57:22.642
- And here you go.
- Thanks.

57:22.725 --> 57:24.560
You're welcome.

57:26.771 --> 57:29.190
- So, I was just wondering...
- A machine did this?

57:29.273 --> 57:31.651
Mm-hmm. Yup.

57:31.734 --> 57:33.277
Huh.

57:33.361 --> 57:35.363
I worked at Borders for a while.

57:36.739 --> 57:39.033
Oh, the bookstore?

57:39.116 --> 57:42.620
Yeah, but they had a café too.
I got pretty good with the steamer.

57:42.703 --> 57:45.790
- Mmm.
- Could do smiley faces, winking faces.

57:45.873 --> 57:49.377
Certain kinds of centaurs, oak leaves,

57:49.460 --> 57:51.379
snowmen, diagram of an atom.

57:51.462 --> 57:54.590
- Wow.
- Flaming swords, Kevin.

57:54.674 --> 57:56.008
- Quite a skill.
- Do you know...

57:56.092 --> 57:57.677
- Hmm?
- Christian's whereabouts

57:57.760 --> 57:59.762
the day before yesterday?

57:59.845 --> 58:01.389
[laughing] Oh, well...

58:01.472 --> 58:04.558
Honey, I barely know his whereabouts
any day.

58:04.642 --> 58:07.812
But... he does have a job?

58:07.895 --> 58:10.690
Well, some would say that's all he has.

58:12.191 --> 58:14.819
- What's he do?
- Mmm.

58:15.319 --> 58:16.987
Um...

58:17.530 --> 58:19.949
Lawyer, you know.

58:22.076 --> 58:25.037
[laughing]

58:25.121 --> 58:26.872
[snorting]

58:27.581 --> 58:29.083
[clears throat]

58:31.335 --> 58:34.630
Is he, uh... Is he in his van now?

58:34.714 --> 58:37.591
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no.

58:37.675 --> 58:40.761
That's Chris Junior you're talking about.

58:41.345 --> 58:46.350
Yeah, Christian got him that van
for his 16th if he got all B's.

58:46.851 --> 58:50.020
He flunked, but he got to keep it anyway.

58:50.104 --> 58:51.605
Just sayin'.

58:52.857 --> 58:54.650
Do you know where your son is now?

58:54.734 --> 58:56.902
Ooh, whoa. Stepson.

58:56.986 --> 58:59.655
I have no idea where he is.

59:00.865 --> 59:02.783
He got into drugs.

59:03.367 --> 59:05.703
He was in jail a little bit for that.

59:05.786 --> 59:09.373
And then he started hanging around
with all the people he met in there.

59:09.457 --> 59:11.333
Bunch of creeps.

59:11.834 --> 59:14.086
His father recently cut him off.

59:14.170 --> 59:17.673
Canceled his ATM cards, everything.

59:18.257 --> 59:19.884
You know, TMI...

59:21.135 --> 59:23.596
Chrissy always made me kinda nervous...

59:24.180 --> 59:26.223
even before all that.

59:26.307 --> 59:28.058
<i>Did you ever see The Omen?</i>

59:28.642 --> 59:30.728
That little kid.

59:30.811 --> 59:32.062
Never know.

59:33.105 --> 59:36.525
- He'd just throw you down the stairs.
- The hell is this?

59:36.609 --> 59:40.905
Oh! Well, the police
are asking about Chrissy.

59:42.615 --> 59:44.742
Is that your shit box out front?

59:44.825 --> 59:46.660
- Yes, but...
- Hands!

59:46.744 --> 59:48.788
- [cup shatters]
- Put 'em up, now.

59:48.871 --> 59:51.874
Oh, people. Can you... [sighs]

59:55.211 --> 59:57.630
- Don't move.
- Oh, my God.

59:59.632 --> 01:00:01.592
- [man] Clear!
- Of course it's clear.

01:00:01.675 --> 01:00:03.636
- Meredith.
- What?

01:00:04.512 --> 01:00:06.305
- Are you retarded?
- What?

01:00:06.889 --> 01:00:09.391
Don't you dare use the “R” word around me!

01:00:09.475 --> 01:00:11.977
- [man] Master bedroom, clear!
- Those are not police.

01:00:12.061 --> 01:00:13.354
Yeah, I know that.

01:00:14.522 --> 01:00:17.942
- Then why are you talking to them?
- Because I'm fucking bored!

01:00:18.025 --> 01:00:19.819
[man] Massage room, clear!

01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:24.198
You are lucky all we're doing is talking.

01:00:24.281 --> 01:00:26.826
Don't flatter yourself, baby.

01:00:26.909 --> 01:00:28.160
Walden Pond room, clear!

01:00:28.244 --> 01:00:31.413
Well, I guess I will just get some soda
for the rug.

01:00:35.334 --> 01:00:36.961
We're all clear.

01:00:40.047 --> 01:00:41.882
[clears throat]

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.303
Come home to this shit.

01:00:48.848 --> 01:00:51.684
Okay. Who...? [Sighs]

01:00:55.771 --> 01:00:57.857
- Who are you?
- I invoke the Fifth Amendment.

01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.942
- My name is Ruth...
- [laughs]

01:01:01.777 --> 01:01:03.195
And why are you here?

01:01:04.196 --> 01:01:07.241
Your son broke into my house
and stole my stuff.

01:01:07.324 --> 01:01:10.160
- [banging]
- Knock it off!

01:01:11.704 --> 01:01:13.706
- Well, what...
- [loud clattering]

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:18.627
What does that have to do with me?

01:01:18.711 --> 01:01:20.462
I thought he lived here.

01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:22.715
So you impersonate cops, why?

01:01:24.633 --> 01:01:27.970
To find him in case he wasn't here.

01:01:28.053 --> 01:01:29.680
To what end?

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:32.766
[Ruth] To confront him.

01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:37.479
“How dare you. Wah, wah.” Like that?

01:01:38.147 --> 01:01:41.317
Yeah. Yes. Exactly.

01:01:42.818 --> 01:01:44.820
You can't do that to people.

01:01:46.655 --> 01:01:48.949
You say that like it means something.

01:01:49.783 --> 01:01:52.745
Look, I don't condone my son's behavior,

01:01:52.828 --> 01:01:56.999
but anyone can do anything
if you let them.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:01:59.168
Huh?

01:01:59.251 --> 01:02:01.170
Welcome to the world.

01:02:02.713 --> 01:02:04.882
I see why he turned out like he did.

01:02:07.885 --> 01:02:09.386
You have kids?

01:02:11.722 --> 01:02:15.809
Uh-uh. So you have no idea
what you're talking about, do you?

01:02:16.435 --> 01:02:22.274
Christian has had more advantages
and opportunities

01:02:22.358 --> 01:02:27.029
than 99.9% of the people on this planet.

01:02:27.112 --> 01:02:29.156
And that's because of me.

01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:33.202
So don't come to me
with this nature-nurture horseshit.

01:02:33.285 --> 01:02:35.371
All right? How much?

01:02:37.581 --> 01:02:39.208
I don't want a payoff.

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:42.920
Well, then I'm confused. What do you want?

01:02:44.922 --> 01:02:48.759
For people to not be assholes.

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:55.683
Mm-hmm.

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:01.271
Well, you know, it's probably gonna stain.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:08.362
- Are you gonna shoot us?
- Don't be so goddamned dramatic.

01:03:08.988 --> 01:03:10.990
Then we'll leave.

01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:21.125
Thanks for the cappuccino.
The foam was amazing.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:23.210
You are very welcome.

01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:31.635
You can tell yourself
you've done something here,

01:03:31.719 --> 01:03:33.345
if that'll help.

01:03:33.429 --> 01:03:35.639
Really took a stand.

01:03:35.723 --> 01:03:39.560
You know what? Guys like that,
that's just unhappiness eating 'em up.

01:03:39.643 --> 01:03:41.645
- You ought to feel sorry for him.
- [door slams]

01:03:49.028 --> 01:03:50.529
[sighs]

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:04.043
What are you doing?

01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:08.213
No, no, not the giraffe. Not the giraffe!

01:04:11.467 --> 01:04:13.343
Put it... Put the tiger down.

01:04:15.471 --> 01:04:16.764
Ruth, no, no. No, no, no.

01:04:22.102 --> 01:04:24.605
- Ruth, you gotta put that back.
- I'm taking him.

01:04:24.688 --> 01:04:26.523
Why?

01:04:26.607 --> 01:04:28.817
[tires squealing]

01:04:39.036 --> 01:04:40.537
The fuck?

01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:45.250
I mean, fuck it. Let's just... do this.
He's finally there now.

01:04:45.334 --> 01:04:48.378
I'm not doing a damn thing
until I know their piece in this.

01:04:49.213 --> 01:04:52.591
They're on us yesterday, they're here
today. She's ripping up yard art.

01:04:52.674 --> 01:04:54.676
You're gonna tell me
you're comfortable with that?

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.386
- No.
- Wha...?

01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:02.434
We already got the security guy
to think about.

01:05:02.893 --> 01:05:05.562
You wanna walk into some kind of dog fuck?

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:06.730
Okay.

01:05:06.814 --> 01:05:09.233
- Fine. What am I supposed to do about it?
- Fuck.

01:05:09.817 --> 01:05:11.026
Jesus.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.904
- Jesus. Fucking Christ.
- Shut up.

01:05:13.987 --> 01:05:15.531
- Don't fucking throw bottles at me.
- Shut up.

01:05:15.614 --> 01:05:17.095
- Fuck you.
- [man] Both you, shut up.

01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:28.210
What?

01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:30.712
What do you mean, what?

01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:32.798
What's your problem?

01:05:35.008 --> 01:05:36.969
That's not your lawn tiger.

01:05:38.053 --> 01:05:40.430
- Did you hear that guy?
- I heard him.

01:05:40.514 --> 01:05:42.850
But he's not the one
that robbed your house,

01:05:42.933 --> 01:05:45.227
and that's not your lawn tiger.

01:05:45.936 --> 01:05:48.230
- If I'd known that this was gonna be...
- I get it.

01:05:48.313 --> 01:05:50.315
- You know, the objective...
- I get it.

01:05:50.399 --> 01:05:52.234
- Of the mission...
- I get it.

01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:58.365
- I wouldn't have participated.
- I get it.

01:06:01.618 --> 01:06:03.871
Thanks for the backup in there.

01:06:03.954 --> 01:06:04.955
The ba...?

01:06:05.956 --> 01:06:08.125
All I've done is back you up.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:09.585
Till now.

01:06:18.427 --> 01:06:20.053
[Tony] That's not your lawn tiger.

01:06:20.137 --> 01:06:23.056
[Ruth]
Yeah, yeah. What would Jesus do, right?

01:06:27.769 --> 01:06:29.271
Tony...

01:06:40.157 --> 01:06:41.658

01:07:29.665 --> 01:07:32.084
[screen door opening]

01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:03.865
What'd you tell my dad?

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.209
No...

01:08:15.294 --> 01:08:17.129
[wheezing]

01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:22.134
Oh, fuck.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.430
[horn honks]

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:31.350
Oh, f...

01:08:36.398 --> 01:08:38.859
- She's calling, she's calling.
- I see it, I see it.

01:08:44.197 --> 01:08:47.951
Hi. I just... Someone broke into my house.
He came out...

01:09:19.358 --> 01:09:23.069
You have such beautiful black little eyes.

01:09:25.404 --> 01:09:26.907
Okay.

01:09:28.908 --> 01:09:31.703
[hard rock, loud]

01:10:06.863 --> 01:10:09.074
He just ran right out.

01:10:11.952 --> 01:10:13.578
[Tony] What happened?

01:10:13.662 --> 01:10:16.373
[man] Some idiot ran in front of a bus.

01:10:23.088 --> 01:10:24.423
Ruth?

01:10:29.428 --> 01:10:31.012
Ruth?

01:10:31.096 --> 01:10:32.722
[screen door closes]

01:10:52.659 --> 01:10:54.286
You got it?

01:10:57.956 --> 01:11:00.417
- [gasps] No, no, no, no, no!
- [gun clicks]

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.751
You carry this one, okay?

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:06.882
- Why?
- [woman] 'Cause we're shorthanded.

01:11:06.965 --> 01:11:08.175
Which is on you.

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:12.220
I just... It's not gonna...
I think I should just stay here.

01:11:12.304 --> 01:11:15.765
I'm gonna be so quiet.
I promise you, okay?

01:11:15.849 --> 01:11:17.767
No, this is what's gonna happen.

01:11:17.851 --> 01:11:20.729
You're gonna carry this gun,
you're gonna get them to open the door.

01:11:20.812 --> 01:11:23.648
When they come to the door, point
the gun at 'em so they don't do anything.

01:11:23.732 --> 01:11:25.525
I am not gonna be good at that.

01:11:25.609 --> 01:11:28.445
[man] We get what we need,
and we get out, and that's it.

01:11:33.325 --> 01:11:35.744
How do I know that you're not gonna...?

01:11:37.412 --> 01:11:40.707
You know that I will if you don't.

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:44.294
It's karma. For Chrissy.

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:04.773
[doorbell buzzes]

01:12:09.945 --> 01:12:11.446
<i>Yes?</i>

01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:17.953
Hi, it's... it's Ruth again. Sorry.

01:12:23.708 --> 01:12:25.794
Please don't do anything.

01:12:26.878 --> 01:12:28.505
I'm compliant.

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.092
Why? Why, why, why? Don't.

01:12:33.176 --> 01:12:34.176
Stop.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.347
- You.
- I'm so sorry.

01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:40.976
- This is... This is not my fault.
- You took my tiger.

01:12:41.059 --> 01:12:43.140
- Yes, I did do that, but...
- You're pointing a gun.

01:12:43.186 --> 01:12:45.230
- I know, I know, but...
- Shut up!

01:12:45.313 --> 01:12:47.315
Meredith, do what they say.

01:12:56.866 --> 01:12:59.160
- Stop, stop. Don't. Stop!
- Sit the fuck down.

01:13:00.453 --> 01:13:01.538
- Stop.
- Oh, my...

01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:03.415
Don't do that.

01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:05.709
Okay.

01:13:07.377 --> 01:13:10.046
- This is unbelievable.
- Where is he?

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:12.048
He's sleeping one off.

01:13:13.216 --> 01:13:14.801
Call him.

01:13:14.884 --> 01:13:18.972
You know, if you're here for what you
think you're here for, your timing stinks.

01:13:19.055 --> 01:13:21.266
Meredith, be quiet.

01:13:22.058 --> 01:13:23.560
Call him.

01:13:24.728 --> 01:13:27.230
[Ruth] Oh, just do it. Please. Please.

[Chris] What?

01:13:45.415 --> 01:13:46.833
Come here!

01:13:46.916 --> 01:13:48.335
[Chris] For what?

- [Meredith] No.
- His van's parked out front.

[whispers] I don't know.

01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:21.868
Uh, maybe he's waiting for you
to come outside.

01:14:21.951 --> 01:14:24.454
You know he doesn't like me too much.

01:14:34.589 --> 01:14:35.589
Cesar?

01:14:36.966 --> 01:14:39.678
Shh. [Whispers] Don't answer.

01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:57.696

Okay. Everybody, just hold it.
Stop doing that.

Jesus. [Laughing] Wow.

01:15:43.491 --> 01:15:45.118
I know you.

Marshall, right?

01:15:48.621 --> 01:15:50.415
Your name is Marshall!

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:54.919
You were at one
of Chrissy's hearings last year.

01:15:58.256 --> 01:15:59.883
Go ahead. Get in the fireplace.

01:15:59.966 --> 01:16:02.260
What...? What did he tell you?

01:16:02.343 --> 01:16:05.138
That I keep cash around here, huh?

01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:07.307
I haven't seen him in months.

01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:10.477
You amateurs, it's not even here anymore.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.061
Bullshit.

Chrissy told us about the iron in there,
so don't even try that shit.

01:16:38.087 --> 01:16:40.298

You saw the gun was empty. You saw.
