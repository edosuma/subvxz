of saying thanks.

from being blown to figurines.

some time to think about this.

laugh at my problems

I’d be able to handle

it wasn’t a solution.

and the least I can do

is take you out
for a night on the town.

had a butterscotch hand grenade

this was funnier.

the‐the doctor was right.

makes life a blast.

the punch line yet.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.984

turns around to the kangaroo

and he says, "Don’t look at me.
You’re the one with the pouch!"

that we’re still alive

Marvin, I‐I gotta tell ya

I‐I was a little
nervous at first.

‐Oh! Ah!
‐You are an okay guy.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.616
No, this evening has
been a lot of fun.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.851
It sure has.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.019
You know, a lot of people
told me, I‐I shouldn’t go out

07:33.053 --> 07:35.756
in public, because they figured
I’d be gunned down.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.028

marshmallows?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.764

wh‐what do you mean

07:45.632 --> 07:47.568
you might be
gunned down?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.102
Oh, don’t worry
about me.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.070
Tomorrow, I go into

Protection program.

Congratulations, Marvin.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.578

Thanks.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.614
Marvin...who do you need
to be protected from?

08:00.647 --> 08:01.815
I thought all the people
you testified

08:01.848 --> 08:04.050
against were sent to prison.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.519
All except two.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.554
They couldn’t make a case
against them, heh‐heh.

08:07.588 --> 08:11.224
Balki...
which do you prefer?

08:11.257 --> 08:12.793
The big marshmallows
or the minis?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.227
Oh, I like the big ones.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.663
They last longer
and every once in a while

08:16.697 --> 08:19.232
you come across one that
looks like Tip O’Neill.

08:22.035 --> 08:26.006
Marvin, these two guys that
you didn’t send to prison

08:26.039 --> 08:28.875
aren’t they kind
of upset with you?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.243
Oh, yeah.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.548
But who cares? They’re just
a couple of enforcers.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.917
Balki, just
a suggestion...nutmeg.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.652
Love it!

08:41.587 --> 08:43.690
‐Enforcers?
‐Yeah.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.727
You know, gangsters,
hit men who kill people.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.631
‐Who wants Sweet’n Low?
‐Me.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.166
Well, Marvin, you shouldn’t
be out in public.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.069
Larry, there is nothing
to worry about.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.672
‐I have contacts.
‐Contacts?

08:58.705 --> 09:01.842
You mean you know people who
will protect you from the mob?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.845
No. I mean,
I’m wearing contacts.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.012
They change the color
of my eyes.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.014
Nobody will
recognize me.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.252
‐Changes my whole appearance.
‐Well, Marvin.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.588
You know, uh, it’s been
very nice seeing you again

09:14.621 --> 09:16.590
and good luck
in all your endeavors.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.692
Wait a minute!
I‐I haven’t had my cocoa yet.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.926
We’ll mail it to you.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.764
I‐I don’t believe
what my eyes are hearing.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.068
Was it the nutmeg remark?
I’m not married to the nutmeg.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.205
‐Cousin‐‐
‐No, Balki, don’t you get it?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.874
The mob is after this man.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.042
They want to kill him,
and if we are with him

09:36.076 --> 09:38.244
they might want
to kill us too.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.479
Are you saying you
want me to leave?

09:39.513 --> 09:42.115
Because if you want me to leave,
just say you want me to leave.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.851
‐I want you to leave.
‐What are you saying?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.290
We’re saying,
we‐we don’t want you to leave.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.358
Cousin, cousin,
your imagination is playing

09:52.392 --> 09:54.060
trick or treat
with your mind.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.261
We haven’t seen
anyone that looks like

to hurt Marvin.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.164
Uh, of course,
you wouldn’t see them.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.033
No, no, no.
T‐they’re professionals.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.301
That’s right.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.771
For all we know they could have
been following us all night.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.808
We‐we don’t know if they’re
just watching us right now...

10:07.841 --> 10:09.409
Oh, my Lord!

10:09.442 --> 10:12.045
The‐the blinds
are wide open!

10:13.747 --> 10:16.683
you’re making a mountain
out of a Mohawk.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.221
The next thing
you’re going to say

10:21.254 --> 10:23.156
is that‐that big,
humongous man

10:23.189 --> 10:25.391
standing across the street
is a killer.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.960
Oh, my God!

10:26.993 --> 10:28.962
That looks like
Max the Terminator!

10:31.164 --> 10:33.099
It’s Arnold Schwarzenegger?

10:34.701 --> 10:37.237
Arnold, loved you
in "Twins!"

10:38.872 --> 10:40.340
No, no, no,
no, no.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.844
Max is the mob’s top hit man.
He’s the best.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.413
‐This is really quite an honor.
‐Well...you deserve it.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.815
Oh!

10:50.383 --> 10:52.352
We’ve got to call
the police.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.693
Hello! Hello?
The phone’s dead.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.696
They cut the wires.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.099
Well, they’re
in big trouble now.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.102
They’ll have to answer
to the phone company for this.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.206
We’ve got to make
a run for it!

11:24.417 --> 11:26.286
Cousin, why we did
come back in?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.454
Because there’s a man
blocking the stairs.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.756
He must be one
of the killers.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.324
He’s wearing
a shoulder holster.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.393
Well, just because
the man is a fashion maverick

11:33.426 --> 11:35.395
don’t mean
he’s a bad person.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.934
A gun! He has a gun
in the shoulder holster.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.769
Oh God!
We’re trapped!

11:42.803 --> 11:44.771
We’re all gonna die!

11:50.511 --> 11:53.246
[instrumental music]

11:58.519 --> 12:01.087
There’s a hit man on the street,
another on the stairs.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.423
I don’t wanna die.
I don’t wanna die.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.792
‐I don’t wanna die.
‐No, Marvin! Marvin! Marvin!

12:05.826 --> 12:07.794
‐Pull yourself together!
‐Whoa!

12:07.828 --> 12:09.796
Oh, I don’t
feel too good.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.031
I better lie down.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.899
I’m a fainter,
you know.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.034
Oh.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.002
It’s gonna be alright.
It’s gonna be alright.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.104
We just have to
find a way

12:18.138 --> 12:20.340
to get a message
out of here!

12:20.373 --> 12:23.109
Cousin, if we were outdoors,
we could make a fire

12:23.143 --> 12:24.277
and send up
smoke signals.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.946
Yeah, well,
we’re not outdoors...

12:25.979 --> 12:28.515
‐Signals! Yes!
‐I’ll get the matches!

12:28.549 --> 12:30.216
You want me to start
breaking up furniture?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.018
No! No!

12:32.052 --> 12:33.319
Balki!

12:33.353 --> 12:35.021
[grunts]

12:38.358 --> 12:41.294
Not smoke signals.

12:43.496 --> 12:47.901
We’ll tap out a distress signal
in Morse Code on the ceiling.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.369
Jennifer and Mary Anne
will hear it

12:49.402 --> 12:51.371
and call the police!

12:52.539 --> 12:53.840
Let’s go!

12:53.874 --> 12:54.875
(both)
Aah!

12:56.309 --> 12:58.478
Jennifer and Mary Anne
know Morse Code?

12:58.512 --> 12:59.846
They’re flight
attendants.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.382
They learn all the codes,
Morse, area, zip.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.119
Now, we’ll send an SOS.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.854
S is dot‐dash‐dot.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.990
‐No cousin, it’s dot‐dot‐dot.
‐No, it’s dot‐dash‐dot.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.057
‐Dot‐dot‐dot.
‐Dot‐dash‐dot.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.125
‐Dot‐dot‐dot.
‐Dot‐dash‐dot.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.226
‐Dot‐dot‐dot.
‐Dot‐dash‐dot.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.227
Cousin, cousin.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.931
I used to work
for Mypos Western Union, okay?

13:18.599 --> 13:20.601
Dot‐dot‐dot.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.303
Alright.
Yeah, wait!

13:30.243 --> 13:32.412
[pounding]

13:53.600 --> 13:54.868
Sorry.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.505
I guess I over‐tapped.

13:58.539 --> 14:00.206
[knock on door]

14:01.007 --> 14:02.042
Wow!

14:04.110 --> 14:05.345
That was quick.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.014
I must be good.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.453
Well, careful.
This could be a trick.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.593
Who is it?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.296
(Jennifer)
’Larry, stop clowning around.’

14:27.500 --> 14:29.069
Jennifer, Mary Anne,
get‐get in here quick.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.404
What’s all
the screaming about?

14:31.437 --> 14:33.173
Girls, go back upstairs

14:33.206 --> 14:36.109
we’re trying to send you
a message to call the police.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.277
Well, it’s too late now.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.880
No, it isn’t, cousin,
the police are open all night.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.316
Larry, What’s all this
about the police?

14:43.349 --> 14:45.351
Jennifer, I don’t
want to alarm you

14:45.385 --> 14:48.955
but we’re surrounded
by killers.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.423
You’re kidding, right?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.358
No, he’s serious.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.695
‐Who are you?
‐Uh, I’m Marvin Berman.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.163
The man the killers
are trying to kill.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.532
How do you do?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.136
I’m Mary Anne.
Nice to meet you.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.107
Someone’s trying
to kill you?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.309
Well, I‐I think,
I think I can clear this up.

15:09.342 --> 15:13.446
You see, Marvin, uh,
was a witness against the mob

15:13.479 --> 15:15.649
and they’re not
taking it well

15:15.682 --> 15:19.385
so...they sent
Arnold Schwarzenegger

15:19.419 --> 15:23.456
and the fashion victim
down the hall...to kill him.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.993
But don’t worry, because
if we can hold on till tomorrow

15:27.027 --> 15:30.363
Marvin will be in
the Witness Projectile Program.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.267
Marvin Berman!

15:34.300 --> 15:37.137
Well, you’re the guy who tried
to blow up Larry and Balki.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.105
‐Guilty as charged.
‐Oh.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.209
Why don’t we just
call the police?

15:43.243 --> 15:44.745
The phone lines
have been cut.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.614
‐You mean, we’re trapped?
‐No, we are not.

15:47.648 --> 15:49.249
Someone could go up
the fire escape

15:49.282 --> 15:51.017
across the roof
to the next building.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.654
‐You could get help there.
‐That might work.

15:53.687 --> 15:57.057
Even if Max shoots, the falling
body will draw attention.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.997
Well, somebody’s
got to do something.

16:04.030 --> 16:07.133
‐I’m going.
‐Be careful, Larry.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.637
Jennifer,
if I don’t come back...

16:10.671 --> 16:13.106
...promise me
you’ll never marry.

16:15.141 --> 16:19.212
Gee, Larry,
never is a long time.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.316
I’ll have to
think about it.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.318
That’s good enough for me.

16:27.588 --> 16:29.523
Well...

16:29.556 --> 16:31.491
...I guess this is it.

16:34.628 --> 16:36.697
(Balki)
’There goes a brave man.’

16:38.064 --> 16:40.701
’A man who is willing
to risk his life’

16:40.734 --> 16:42.536
for his friends.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.171
A man who is willing

16:45.205 --> 16:47.508
to fight any foe.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.646
A man, who is coming back
in the window.

16:55.516 --> 16:56.717
There’s another man
on the roof.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.184
There’s no way out.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.586
Boy, I bet they wouldn’t
treat me like this

16:59.620 --> 17:01.321
if I was wearing dynamite.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.289
[knock on door]

17:03.323 --> 17:05.659
(male #1)
’Anybody home?
It’s the phone man.’

17:05.692 --> 17:07.728
Oh, thank goodness,
it’s the phone man.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.064
(all)
No. No! No!

17:11.097 --> 17:13.499
Mary Anne, it’s the oldest
trick in the book.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.135
They cut the phone lines,
and then they send in

17:15.167 --> 17:17.303
a killer posing
as a repairman.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.339
Oh, what are we
going to do?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.674
Alright, look.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.808
We’ll take him
by surprise.

17:21.842 --> 17:24.176
When he comes in,
we’ll throw a blanket over him

17:24.210 --> 17:26.378
and tie him up!
Balki, you get the tape.

17:26.412 --> 17:29.115
Good idea, cousin.
We’ll record the capture.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.352
Not that
kind of tape.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.221
Get tape
to tie him up.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.322
Alright, Jennifer
and Mary Anne

17:36.356 --> 17:38.559
don’t open the door
till I give you the signal.

17:38.592 --> 17:40.393
Marvin, stick with me.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.462
[knock on door]

17:42.495 --> 17:44.565
(male #1)
’Anybody home?
It’s the phone man.’

17:49.402 --> 17:51.237
[knock on door]

17:51.271 --> 17:52.639
Ready?

17:52.673 --> 17:53.774
Now.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.311
Won’t you come in?

17:58.344 --> 17:59.613
I’m here to
eliminate a problem.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.648
[screaming]

18:05.819 --> 18:07.253
Spin him.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.555
Spin him.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.661
Balki, quick!
In the closet.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.736
Not you!

18:22.769 --> 18:25.338
Him! Him!

18:36.750 --> 18:38.384
Now all we have to do
is do that every time

18:38.418 --> 18:40.353
someone knocks on the door,
and we’re home free.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.190
I hope we don’t run out
of blankets.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.458
[knock on door]

18:49.495 --> 18:52.465
[mumbling]

19:00.807 --> 19:01.842
Right.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.345
‐Won’t you come in?
‐Hello, I’m looking for‐‐

19:05.378 --> 19:06.780
[screaming]

19:06.813 --> 19:07.881
Spin him!

19:07.914 --> 19:09.550
Spin him!
Spin him!

19:09.583 --> 19:11.518
Freeze! FBI!

19:13.587 --> 19:17.190
Cousin, it’s the oldest
trick in the book.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.427
They pose as FBI agents

19:21.461 --> 19:24.164
and then they come in
and fix your phone.

19:28.869 --> 19:31.371
‐Dr. Shore!
‐You know him?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.339
Shore? Sure.

19:35.709 --> 19:36.877
I’m a psychiatrist.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.746
I’ve been working with Marvin
for the past six months.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.649
So these really are
FBI agents.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.317
You know, in this light

19:44.350 --> 19:46.620
he doesn’t look like
Max the Terminator at all.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.959
But he does kind of look like
the neighbor on "Doogie Howser."

19:55.929 --> 19:57.898
A lot of people
tell me that.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.467
Marvin ran away
from the hotel

20:01.502 --> 20:03.737
where he was being held
in protective custody...

20:03.770 --> 20:05.606
...and given his
rather explosive past

20:05.639 --> 20:07.240
the FBI thought
it would be wise

20:07.273 --> 20:09.475
if I talk him
into coming back.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.978
You didn’t have to go
to all that trouble.

20:12.012 --> 20:13.880
Marvin, don’t you think
it would be nice

20:13.914 --> 20:14.781
if you went with
these gentlemen

20:14.815 --> 20:17.383
and got a head start
on your new life?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.385
Sure, Dr. Shore.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.455
Oh, Balki, Larry...

20:22.488 --> 20:24.658
...it’s really been
an exciting evening.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.928
Marvin, I’m gonna miss you,
you big lug nut!

20:27.961 --> 20:30.897
Oh! I’m gonna
miss you too.

20:30.931 --> 20:32.999
Listen, if you’re ever in
Topeka, Kansas, look me up.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.768
M‐my new name’s
Orville Purdue.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.269
Marvin!

20:36.302 --> 20:38.471
You’re not supposed
to tell people that.

20:38.505 --> 20:42.042
Oh! Ugh, forget that,
forget that.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.945
‐Oh! Goodbye, Larry.
‐Goodbye, Marvin.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.847
Nice meeting you, ladies.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.815
‐Coming, Shore?
‐Sure.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.758
Well, h‐how do you
like that?

20:57.791 --> 21:01.562
They weren’t killers
after all. They were FBI.

21:01.595 --> 21:02.896
Larry, don’t take
this personally

21:02.929 --> 21:04.631
but this is
the last time

21:04.665 --> 21:06.600
I come downstairs
when I hear screaming.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.536
Perfectly
understandable.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.440
Thanks for
a lovely evening, Balki.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.411
I don’t get it,
I thought we were gonna see

21:18.444 --> 21:19.913
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.521
Well, why don’t we
clean this place up?

21:27.554 --> 21:29.623
Then I’m gonna turn in.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.425
Fear of death
really tires me out.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.704
(both)
Oh! Oh! Oh!

21:43.737 --> 21:46.507
W‐w‐we’re sorry.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.509
I’m so sorry.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.112
We‐we thought
you were, uh, a killer.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.780
Well, I’m not a killer,
I’m with the phone company!

21:53.814 --> 21:55.749
The phones
in this building are out.

21:56.850 --> 21:57.951
By the way,
where’s your phone?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.553
Uh, it’s right over there.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.356
Thanks.

22:03.389 --> 22:06.827
While you’re here, we’d like to
talk to you about call waiting.

22:18.572 --> 22:20.507
You got it!

22:30.817 --> 22:33.987
Well, if that’s all it took,
we could have done it ourselves.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.466
[theme music]
