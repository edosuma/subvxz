00:46.080 --> 00:49.516
- There's joy
Hello, hello, swallows

00:49.760 --> 00:51.591
There's joy
In the sky

00:51.960 --> 00:54.394
Over the roofs
There's joy

00:54.640 --> 00:57.912
And sun in the little streets
There's joy, everywhere there's joy

01:00.360 --> 01:02.351
All day long my heart beats, 
capsizes and staggers

01:02.600 --> 01:06.229
It's love
That comes with whatever

01:06.600 --> 01:09.478
It's love, hello hello 
ladies, there's joy

01:09.840 --> 01:11.990
Everywhere there is joy

01:12.040 --> 01:14.237
The baker kneads 
the dough with both arms

01:14.400 --> 01:17.517
He makes good bread
so fine that I am hungry

01:17.880 --> 01:21.492
We see the mailman flying over there

01:22.320 --> 01:24.914
Like a blue angel
Bringing his letters to God

01:25.160 --> 01:26.195
Miracle without a name

01:26.560 --> 01:28.437
At station Javel

01:28.800 --> 01:31.314
We see the subway
Coming out of its tunnel

01:31.680 --> 01:33.518
Drunk with sun, songs,

01:33.680 --> 01:35.113
And flowers...

01:35.360 --> 01:37.918
It runs toward the woods
It runs at full steam

01:40.560 --> 01:42.198
There's joy, the Eiffel tower
goes for a walk

01:42.560 --> 01:45.433
Like a mad woman she jumps over
the Seine, then she says

01:45.480 --> 01:47.471
"Too bad for me 
if I get sick"

01:47.720 --> 01:50.473
I was bored all alone
In my corner"

01:50.840 --> 01:52.796
There's joy...

01:53.160 --> 01:55.754
the taxman put on his vest

01:55.800 --> 01:58.851
Closes shop and says
in a very very kind way

01:59.220 --> 02:02.636
Hello, for today the collect
is over, keep it all gentlemen.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.555
But suddenly I wake up

02:05.920 --> 02:07.876
In my bed,
So, I was dreaming

02:08.240 --> 02:10.435
for sure as the sky is gray

02:10.800 --> 02:12.313
I must get up,
wash up

02:12.680 --> 02:15.035
Get dressed
And not sing

02:15.400 --> 02:18.312
If you have nothing to say
But I still believe

02:18.680 --> 02:21.752
That this dream is good
As it let me make a song.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.998
Song of Spring
Song of love

02:25.360 --> 02:28.511
Song for 20 years old
Song for always

02:28.880 --> 02:31.314
There is joy...

02:31.680 --> 02:35.520
The Suicide Shop

03:09.440 --> 03:11.510
- What happened to you?

03:11.580 --> 03:14.150
You wanted to commit suicide? Right?
Well yes, of course.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.958
- Don't you know it's forbidden?

03:16.700 --> 03:19.675
- What? It's forbidden to commit suicide?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.395
Yes, on the public roads.
Everybody knows that.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.755
- I did not know. Sorry.

03:23.820 --> 03:27.078
- Luckily the cop didn't see it.
You would have been fined.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.311
And it's not a small fine.
I can tell you.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.116
- What do I care
if I'm dead.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.314
- What are you thinking?
They would have gone after your family.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.035
- They couldn't.
I have no family left.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.517
And if you miss? 
What do you get?

03:45.880 --> 03:48.713
A fine and a wheelchair.
You get the picture?

03:49.080 --> 03:50.433
- What do you propose then?

03:51.760 --> 03:52.715
- Shh...

03:53.680 --> 03:55.193
Follow me.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.015
Stop!

04:18.640 --> 04:21.313
With the crisis, which bugs you

04:21.560 --> 04:23.755
- With the crisis which bugs you

04:24.120 --> 04:27.874
- What is sweeter than
an exquisite death

04:28.240 --> 04:29.798
- An exquisite death

04:30.160 --> 04:32.390
Be lucid and daring

04:32.760 --> 04:35.149
Be lucid and daring

04:35.520 --> 04:36.999
Let's say it

04:37.360 --> 04:39.510
- Long life to suicide!

04:44.320 --> 04:46.914
- Enter, enter
Do not be afraid

04:47.280 --> 04:49.748
We are open until 20 pm

04:50.000 --> 04:51.194
Everything is fast

04:51.440 --> 04:52.668
Nothing is misleading

04:52.920 --> 04:55.673
To help you die is our happiness.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.593
- Although it costs you
The first step

04:58.840 --> 05:01.149
Remember that
We are here

05:01.400 --> 05:02.549
- To help you

05:02.920 --> 05:04.114
Without fuss

05:04.480 --> 05:07.756
To go from life to death

05:08.000 --> 05:09.877
From life to death

05:10.240 --> 05:12.879
With the crisis, which bugs you

05:13.240 --> 05:15.879
With the crisis, which bugs you

05:16.240 --> 05:19.869
- What is sweeter than
An exquisite death

05:20.120 --> 05:23.112
An exquisite death
Be lucid

05:23.480 --> 05:25.436
Daring
Be lucid

05:25.800 --> 05:27.153
and daring

05:27.520 --> 05:28.839
Let's say it

05:29.200 --> 05:32.476
Long life to suicide!

05:35.920 --> 05:37.876
- Welcome to paradise

05:38.880 --> 05:41.633
End of worries
As I am saying

05:42.000 --> 05:42.955
- Everything is allowed

05:43.320 --> 05:44.435
Nothing forbidden

05:44.800 --> 05:47.633
- Except that
we don't give credit

05:48.000 --> 05:50.116
To depart
There's a thousand ways

05:50.480 --> 05:52.914
- A fatal choice
300 poisons

05:53.280 --> 05:56.158
Not to mention the hanging-

05:56.520 --> 05:58.875
It's her passion

05:59.240 --> 06:02.755
- Just to think about it
gives me a thrill

06:03.120 --> 06:04.633
The great thrill

06:05.000 --> 06:06.752
With the crisis-

06:07.120 --> 06:08.030
which bugs you

06:08.280 --> 06:10.316
With the crisis which bugs you

06:10.680 --> 06:12.796
- What is sweeter
Than an exquisite death

06:14.720 --> 06:15.789
An exquisite death

06:16.160 --> 06:19.152
Be lucid and daring

06:19.400 --> 06:21.516
Be lucid and daring

06:21.880 --> 06:23.472
Let's say it

06:23.840 --> 06:26.752
Long life to suicide!

06:27.560 --> 06:29.790
We offer quality products.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.070
We guarantee death.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.239
Our motto is to reassure

06:36.480 --> 06:40.155
Either deceased or reimbursed

06:43.040 --> 06:47.033
- We are useful to the whole city
- They're useful

06:47.400 --> 06:52.190
To the whole city
- Whatever your profile

06:52.440 --> 06:54.635
Our profile

06:55.000 --> 06:57.673
Forget it all.
Die in peace.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.837
Die in peace.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.830
Goodbye, life
So be it

07:08.680 --> 07:10.875
Oh, it looks good...

07:11.360 --> 07:12.315
- Hello.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.875
- Enter.
Welcome.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.753
- We will help you.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.189
Right here

07:18.560 --> 07:20.630
In this store you will find 
what you need to kill yourself

07:21.000 --> 07:22.638
It's for this gentleman.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.116
I know. Mishima!

07:26.000 --> 07:28.468
- What can I
 do 
for your pleasure?

07:30.320 --> 07:31.275
- Ben...

07:31.640 --> 07:34.632
- We have the hemp rope.
Squeak, hanging.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.512
Effective.
We can provide the stool.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.676
Otherwise,

07:40.040 --> 07:41.917
We also have it synthetic

07:42.280 --> 07:44.555
The poison, a variety of vials.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.070
Many different speeds.
This one, expensive, but crushes you

07:47.440 --> 07:48.589
in 3 seconds. You are gone!

07:48.960 --> 07:49.915
Gas

07:50.280 --> 07:54.671
granules, 1 bullet revolvers.
The second is useless.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.077
Sleeping pills,
toadstools,

07:58.440 --> 07:59.668
Or razor blades.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.999
Bath, open veins...
Unstoppably photogenic.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.998
My son sharpens them

08:06.360 --> 08:08.032
one by one.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.719
Oh yeah.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.069
- So?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.429
What do you say?

08:12.800 --> 08:13.596
In fact...

08:13.960 --> 08:15.712
As blades we also have low prices

08:16.080 --> 08:17.479
Rusty ones.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.991
If you don't cut deep enough
tetanus is guaranteed

08:21.360 --> 08:23.112
Ah yes, it is tempting.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.557
In fact, I hesitate
between the gas and the poison.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.750
- Yes...

08:28.120 --> 08:30.429
- I'll take a poison.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.429
Take this. It's on sale.
Lightning quick. Guaranteed result.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.638
It sells really well.
It's trendy.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.956
- I'll take that, then.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.469
- LucrÃ¨ce...

08:41.840 --> 08:43.034
Do I gift wrap it?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.150
- No. It's for me.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.033
- It would be more joyful.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.276
That's it.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.631
58 euros.
Ah yes, still...

08:50.000 --> 08:51.592
You can give death to yourself

08:51.960 --> 08:54.394
but death itself is not free.

08:55.540 --> 08:58.076
Anyway, where you are going
you won't spend a penny.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.515
Cries of pain

09:02.760 --> 09:05.479
Are you expecting
a happy event?

09:05.840 --> 09:08.434
- Happy, not sure.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.028
- It will be soon?
- Imminent.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.992
And you, you have orphans?

09:13.160 --> 09:14.229
Excuse me?
I mean you have children?

09:14.600 --> 09:16.795
- No. Seeing what life has in store for them...

09:17.160 --> 09:18.559
Goodbye, sir.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.273
- Thank you very much Madam.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.436
Well then, good evening.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.597
- Thank you. Sorry.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.154
What's good

09:58.520 --> 09:59.794
Resisting

10:00.160 --> 10:03.038
When life is not rosy

10:03.400 --> 10:04.992
When the mood

10:05.360 --> 10:08.670
Is gloomy

10:09.320 --> 10:13.518
What's the use fighting

10:13.880 --> 10:16.952
Against pessimism

10:17.320 --> 10:20.596
But what is being proposed

10:23.040 --> 10:24.792
- Sadness, horror, etc

10:25.280 --> 10:27.510
Nothing to say
When one sees that

10:27.880 --> 10:30.110
It's not worse

10:30.480 --> 10:33.790
than being rats

10:43.080 --> 10:46.959
- To stop climbing those stairs

10:47.320 --> 10:51.916
To stop seeing this scene

10:52.280 --> 10:56.034
To leave before dawn

10:56.400 --> 11:00.393
Because in a few moments

11:00.760 --> 11:02.751
No regrets

11:03.120 --> 11:05.509
Or remorse

11:05.880 --> 11:08.792
I will finally be dead.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.510
- This isn't very joyful
Admit it

11:12.880 --> 11:14.916
But it's like that.
Admit it,

11:15.280 --> 11:17.350
It's no use

11:17.720 --> 11:21.918
of crying for him.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.870
No shit-
It isn't worth staying alive.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.110
And yet I believed in it.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.512
I did my best.
Whatever I could.

11:40.800 --> 11:45.032
But I admit defeat.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.716
He isn't wrong
He is right.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.036
At this stage anyway

11:52.400 --> 11:56.439
Might as well blow his brains out.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.311
Aren't you tired of watching suicides?

12:15.680 --> 12:17.113
- Yes, a little.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.952
It isn't too much fun.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.399
- You are right.
I will talk to mom.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.155
It's OK.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.435
- What's going on?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.950
Phone
ambulance, maternity.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.678
Go on, ma'am.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.393
Push, go!

12:57.760 --> 12:59.352
Yes! Yes! Yes!

13:00.360 --> 13:02.316
Yes! It's a boy!

13:03.560 --> 13:04.675
A very beautiful baby.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.598
Oh, he smiled.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.270
What's that?
My son smiles? No, he isn't.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.750
It must be a fold of mouth.
Why would he smile?

13:32.120 --> 13:33.838
- It looks like a smile.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.996
That would be amazing.
Nobody ever smiled

13:37.360 --> 13:38.236
in our family.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.594
Mishima, come here.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.395
Why?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.879
The client says Alan smiled.
What's that story?

13:48.920 --> 13:53.038
He must have a diarrhea.
It may be confused with a smile,

13:53.100 --> 13:54.430
But it's not. It's just a grin.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.669
Look.

13:56.340 --> 13:59.749
If you push down the corners of the mouth
he's sulking

14:00.120 --> 14:01.189
Like his brother and sister

14:01.260 --> 14:02.595
Since they were born.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.190
Let go, to see.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.234
Tickle tickle...

14:11.600 --> 14:12.555
You see, he's smiling.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.553
Alright! What did you want?
A rope.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.388
To hang myself.
- Good. Follow me.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.835
Your ceiling is high?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.350
- Uh... like that.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.278
- You do not know?

14:25.640 --> 14:27.517
6 feet should suffice.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.438
The noose is all ready.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.075
Just put your head through it.
Here, it's a gift. My pleasure.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.397
How can that be? He smiles?
- It was a pleasure to see

14:38.760 --> 14:40.159
a baby smile.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.999
Yes, yes, it is.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.510
Come on, go home.
You've better things to do there.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.233
- Goodbye, sir.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.914
- That's not true.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.595
- Shit!

15:07.560 --> 15:10.028
Oh, shit!

15:45.520 --> 15:46.475
Good morning.

15:48.960 --> 15:53.317
I keep telling you, not "good morning."
You must say "bad morning"

15:53.680 --> 15:56.672
and "goodbye" rather than "see you"
since they will never come back.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.671
When will you understand that?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.035
What can I do for you?

16:01.400 --> 16:02.355
As a matter of fact,

16:02.720 --> 16:03.596
We are hesitating.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.077
- It would be for Mister,
or Madam?

16:07.440 --> 16:09.954
We would like to go together.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.515
- Good. It is more advantageous.

16:12.760 --> 16:16.230
For Valentine's Day
we have a deal for couples.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.158
- What are you hiding behind your back?

16:26.280 --> 16:28.430
What will we do with you?

16:28.800 --> 16:33.078
You drew your sister busy and pretty.
Don't you see she's useless and ugly?

16:33.340 --> 16:34.550
I think Marilyn is pretty.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.312
Ugly, I'm ugly.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.477
I'm really ugly.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.718
And there he's,
making his sister cry.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.879
Oh, it's snowing...

16:45.920 --> 16:47.512
- Hum... Well, to us.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.673
- What do you say?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.235
- It's sad.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.830
Exactly, that's sad.
And that's why it's pretty.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.387
- That's it.
You will be happy.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.236
- Alan, what do they say?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.391
- See you, good night...

17:11.000 --> 17:11.954
Pardon me.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.470
My mistake.
Goodbye.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.751
Damn. Too late.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.477
- How are the news?
- Alarming.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.711
- Good. It is good for us.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.998
Emergency. I am going.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.719
There, there I am coming...

18:22.960 --> 18:24.234
- Please.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.354
- What is it?
It's urgent. I can't stand it.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.638
14?
I will see if I have it.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.071
14, 

18:42.440 --> 18:44.556
14... Ah!

18:52.080 --> 18:52.796
Where is it?

18:56.440 --> 18:58.635
Where did it go?

19:05.520 --> 19:09.913
What are you doing here?
- I could not sleep.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.595
- 35 Euros.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.792
For 1 bullet only?
One maybe, but the right one.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.030
But in the showcase it's 22 euros.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.310
Night rate.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.033
- Okay, I take it then.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.231
You can come back tomorrow,
if you prefer.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.272
- Absolutely not!
I couldn't wait.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.998
- Who was that?
- A desperate man with an empty gun.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.110
What are you reading?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.072
- Statistics for this year.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.278
One suicide attempt
every 40 min,

19:44.520 --> 19:46.715
but only 20% success.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.435
It's awful 
all those people who miss.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.229
Fortunately we're here.
We are not about to close shop.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.313
- Still, it's not fun.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.630
Good night, darling.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.399
Sweet dreams mom
sweet dreams dad.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.159
Will he be quiet!

20:12.120 --> 20:15.810
I told him, not on the public road!
We could lose our license.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.075
- Alan

20:47.440 --> 20:49.476
hurry up a bit!

20:49.840 --> 20:53.116
Why can't we kill ourselves, mom?

20:53.480 --> 20:56.950
I've told you 100 times, Marilyn.
It is impossible.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.191
- Think, poor nitwit,

20:59.560 --> 21:01.471
Who would keep the store?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.551
Vincent is right. 
This is a family business

21:03.920 --> 21:05.990
started by your great-grandfather,

21:06.160 --> 21:07.475
CÃ©lestin Tuvache.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.676
Later, when we are too old,

21:12.040 --> 21:14.270
you will take over the shop.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.710
- For the boys yes. 
But why can't I cut my veins.

21:19.960 --> 21:20.915
Because it hurts.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.111
And life is beautiful.
- No, Alan.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.311
Life is appalling.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.318
But we must fight.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.635
- So, you wanted something...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.639
- Hello, it's me again.
- Yes, hi there.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.230
...something original,
manly...

21:35.360 --> 21:36.110
And voila.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.751
The seppuku, more commonly
known as hara-kiri.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.314
Not for everybody.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.790
For athletes only.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.315
But strong
as you are...

21:48.680 --> 21:51.638
What is...
was your job?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.194
-Gym teacher

21:53.560 --> 21:55.232
Oh, then it's for you.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.750
I thought of gas or napalm...

21:58.120 --> 22:01.556
A fine-immolation
in a  high school courtyard

22:01.800 --> 22:03.518
it would be striking.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.957
But honestly, seppuku
is more classy.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.514
I sharpen them myself.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.352
Touch the edge of this blade.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.908
It enters in you like in butter.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.272
Come on, children,
let's hurry...

22:19.640 --> 22:21.198
- Bye, mom.
Vincent!

22:21.560 --> 22:22.356
What?

22:22.720 --> 22:24.995
- Here is a demonstration.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.096
Bye dad.
Have a nice day.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.677
- Come on.
You'll be late.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.679
I am not sure I can do it.
You do home service?

22:42.920 --> 22:46.435
And what else?
We are not murderers after all.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.518
We provide.
People manage.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.279
And... it is expensive?

22:50.640 --> 22:54.792
Certainly, but the samuraÃ¯ kimono
is provided: 800 Euros.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.275
Ho, it's quite a sum!

22:56.520 --> 23:00.479
- A shroud has no pockets.
Neither does a kimono ...

23:06.080 --> 23:07.672
Excuse me. Then?

23:08.040 --> 23:10.190
- Well, I'll take it.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.074
- You will not regret it.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.829
Our suicides are guaranteed.
Our motto: "Dead or reimbursed"

23:16.200 --> 23:19.590
You only die once.
Might as well make it a unique...

23:19.960 --> 23:22.030
...unforgettable moment.

24:25.640 --> 24:29.758
- It can't go on
This carnage

24:30.120 --> 24:33.715
It's too horrible
All those people who

24:33.960 --> 24:38.511
All these people who think
Only of the grave

24:41.160 --> 24:44.755
What's the point
In brief

24:45.120 --> 24:49.272
To be on earth
If we think only

24:49.520 --> 24:53.638
If we think only
of comitting suicide.

24:56.840 --> 25:01.356
A peaceful life
Without despair

25:01.600 --> 25:05.798
Quiet life
And then stop

25:06.160 --> 25:08.913
Yes stop moping

25:09.960 --> 25:14.556
Death to Death
Let's be smart

25:14.800 --> 25:19.351
Or else
We're all end up

25:19.720 --> 25:22.280
We will all end up orphans

25:25.160 --> 25:27.355
It's true
It's not funny

25:27.720 --> 25:30.473
But we can't do anything

25:30.720 --> 25:32.233
You shouldn't start as losers

25:32.600 --> 25:34.636
The world belongs to us

25:35.000 --> 25:36.956
We are only children

25:37.320 --> 25:40.198
Just good-for-nothing

25:40.440 --> 25:42.556
- I think we can succeed

25:42.800 --> 25:46.315
Put an end to suicides

25:49.520 --> 25:51.033
Let me think

25:51.400 --> 25:53.516
I may have an idea

25:54.360 --> 25:56.032
- Let him think

25:56.400 --> 25:58.391
- He may have an idea

26:19.640 --> 26:21.995
- It is not easy.
I hesitate.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.751
- LucrÃ¨ce,
can you come?

26:33.200 --> 26:36.670
Madame would like
something feminin.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.189
* Feminin-?

26:39.400 --> 26:40.628
What's most feminin is poison.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.831
It's a bit like a perfume.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.355
I was just preparing some in the lab.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.829
Yes, a poison!
Why not?

26:47.200 --> 26:49.270
Here, our entire range

26:49.520 --> 26:52.557
declined poison water
or concentrated.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.673
More expensive naturally
but so much more effective.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.873
You prefer a contact poison or...

27:00.120 --> 27:02.350
to inhale or to ingest?

27:02.720 --> 27:04.119
- What is the best?

27:04.480 --> 27:06.471
It depends on the desired effect.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.912
I especially research
the effect of death.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.235
- Darling,

27:11.600 --> 27:14.717
I'm going.
Mr. Calmel's delivery.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.275
All this is very tempting.

27:17.640 --> 27:18.516
It is.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.110
All our products are good.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.075
Take your time.
I'll let you think.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.678
- Can I help you?

27:29.440 --> 27:30.793
- This is what?

27:31.160 --> 27:33.799
Freeze-dried amanita phalloides.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.077
It smells nothing
and you feel nothing.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.595
Our customers are happy.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.949
- How do you know?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.959
- None ever came back.

27:54.160 --> 27:59.439
- Dying my natural death
I have no patience

28:00.440 --> 28:06.231
- There's everything you need here
We can trust them

28:08.400 --> 28:13.269
We don't know what to take.
That's why we hesitate.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.869
- A rope to hang

28:18.240 --> 28:21.152
- Or poison "sudden death"

28:21.520 --> 28:24.398
- I thought I'd slash my wrists

28:24.640 --> 28:27.154
Is it a good idea

28:27.400 --> 28:29.516
That's what my brother in law did,

28:29.880 --> 28:33.555
Now deceased.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.030
Wait, wait, think

28:36.760 --> 28:41.880
- Dying without blisters
Or nausea or burns

28:42.240 --> 28:45.277
Guaranteed pure product

28:45.640 --> 28:49.394
Cyanide pellets

28:49.640 --> 28:50.595
This is not good

28:50.960 --> 28:51.915
The poison

28:52.160 --> 28:54.628
In contrast,
The gun shot

28:54.880 --> 28:57.758
Frankly I do not recommend

28:59.520 --> 29:02.239
It's noisy
It's dirty

29:02.480 --> 29:06.234
It is not a wonder

29:15.989 --> 29:17.931
You failed in your life?

29:19.021 --> 29:20.810
Succeed in your death!

30:10.760 --> 30:12.398
- What is it?

30:12.640 --> 30:16.394
- This is Mr. Tuvache.
I bring you your order.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.200
Come in, it's open.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.199
Take the pads.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.029
Enter, Tuvache.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.391
Come in.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.237
- I do not know what to choose.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.160
Sorry to bother you all this time.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.909
Not at all.
Take your time.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.272
- It is not
an easy decision.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.475
Of course.

31:03.640 --> 31:07.110
- Everything is there, Mr. Calmel.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.149
Mr. Calmel?
Ah!

31:13.400 --> 31:17.996
Finally. If you knew how
I've had enough of this shit.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.839
- What shit?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.315
- Life.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.238
Ah yes, life...

31:24.600 --> 31:26.636
Believe me, Tuvache

31:26.880 --> 31:30.077
Go on to the other side,
it's the only solution,

31:30.440 --> 31:33.318
The end of worries,
the big sleep,

31:33.560 --> 31:35.471
The extasy...

31:35.720 --> 31:36.675
- Still,

31:37.040 --> 31:38.359
it isn't very joyful.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.351
- It is those who remain
who are sad.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.559
When you're dead, you won't
be there to miss yourself.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.518
Think about it, man.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.991
Yes, of course.
I put it where?

31:53.360 --> 31:54.509
Give me that!

31:57.520 --> 31:58.350
Finish...

31:59.520 --> 32:02.114
For the little bill...

32:02.480 --> 32:04.118
- There, under the bed.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.595
Finish...

32:48.760 --> 32:50.557
- What would you take?

32:50.920 --> 32:52.831
- I do not know.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.793
To die? Unfortunately 
I can't allow myself.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.435
Must say what is

33:02.800 --> 33:05.519
I have regrets

33:05.880 --> 33:07.074
And remorse

33:07.320 --> 33:11.393
Going on selling death

33:15.640 --> 33:18.108
When I see it all

33:18.360 --> 33:22.194
All that is wrong
All that's not going well

33:22.560 --> 33:27.111
I'd like to jump off a bridge

33:30.080 --> 33:35.154
- I am not in good spirits.
This may be normal

33:35.520 --> 33:38.273
With what happens

33:38.520 --> 33:39.714
All these people

33:39.960 --> 33:41.996
Who leave and pass away

33:45.520 --> 33:47.875
- It would be tempting

33:48.120 --> 33:50.759
A bloodbath

33:51.000 --> 33:53.230
To finish

33:53.600 --> 33:58.037
Once and for all
With the future

34:01.200 --> 34:03.555
- It's not fun

34:03.800 --> 34:06.439
Killing people

34:06.680 --> 34:07.954
And to not be able

34:08.199 --> 34:10.475
Feel more than that about it.

34:11.480 --> 34:16.110
To kill oneself,
To behead oneself

34:16.639 --> 34:20.871
Or be bloodless
Suffocated by your own tongue

34:21.239 --> 34:26.360
- It makes me feel like
ending my life

34:26.840 --> 34:28.717
Sometimes I wonder

34:29.400 --> 34:34.349
As I really got the blues

34:36.840 --> 34:41.914
But we cannot
Neither you nor me

34:42.159 --> 34:44.514
Because we would

34:44.760 --> 34:48.958
have to close shop for good.

34:49.639 --> 34:54.760
Whatever happens
We must remain alive

34:55.000 --> 34:57.719
To insure

34:57.960 --> 35:02.875
Happiness to our suicides

35:11.520 --> 35:13.556
- Well, I'll take that.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.110
You won't regret it.
Silly me, I meant

35:17.360 --> 35:19.949
Let me know how that went.
Hahaha, what a dummy I am!

35:20.000 --> 35:22.514
- It's not too noisy,
at least?

35:22.760 --> 35:24.796
- Are you sure this will work?

35:24.997 --> 35:25.897
Sure.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.593
- Still, it's risky.

35:27.960 --> 35:32.590
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
It's time to move faster.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.478
Otherwise, we will all end up orphans.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.079
We will meet here.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.839
Your father will kill you.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.192
- Do not worry.
- In any case, it will be great.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.310
- Attention...

35:45.640 --> 35:46.959
- What are you doing?

35:47.320 --> 35:48.309
Playing marbles Dad.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.318
And that makes you laugh?

35:50.680 --> 35:53.194
- Well yes,
it's funny.

35:53.260 --> 35:55.118
I don't see what's funny.
- Go home.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.799
Yes, Dad.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.718
Bye Alan...

36:02.160 --> 36:03.115
He laughed.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.397
- You didn't forget Marilyn's birthday?

36:06.760 --> 36:08.671
- I even bought gifts.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.554
- Stop laughing all the time, 
you are irritating me.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.909
- Okay.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.429
- You look stupid.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.472
Yes, Dad.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.877
- You want a cigarette?

36:58.240 --> 36:59.275
- A what?

36:59.640 --> 37:00.868
A cigarette.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.391
- Really?
Can I smoke? At my age?

37:04.760 --> 37:06.796
Of course.
Why not?

37:09.960 --> 37:12.554
You'll see.
This is good for health.

37:12.920 --> 37:17.710
Must inhale, keep it
inside as long as possible.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.109
You like it?

37:22.120 --> 37:24.588
Yes, it's not bad.
Thank you, Dad.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.599
- You see, why not?

37:38.560 --> 37:40.118
- I want to kill myself

37:40.480 --> 37:44.519
but I don't know
if I can afford it.

37:44.880 --> 37:45.995
Wait, the cheapest?

37:46.360 --> 37:47.873
I have what you need.

37:48.240 --> 37:51.791
A bag of our store. Very strong.
Ideal for choking.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.473
And then here, to close it
tight around your throat.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.593
Thank you.
- How much?

37:59.000 --> 38:02.434
- Nothing.
When we can help...

38:02.680 --> 38:07.470
- lf I had met more people
disinterested as you

38:07.720 --> 38:09.119
I would not be here.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.040
- That's it, that's it
Sorry, we are closing.

38:18.120 --> 38:22.352
- You want another cigarette?
Yes, I do.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.757
- Here, keep the pack.
If you want, I will give you

38:26.120 --> 38:28.236
a cartridge.
Thanks, Dad.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.320
Stay here.
Finish your cigarette quietly.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.551
Light up another if you wish.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.997
And do not forget,
inhale all the smoke.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.191
Yes, Dad.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.198
Good evening, my dear.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.994
Good evening my love.
Alan is not with you?

38:49.360 --> 38:51.794
Yes, yes. He is there.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.839
- But he smokes!

38:54.200 --> 38:56.555
What...
- I'll explain.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.798
- Mom, Alan is smoking...

39:01.160 --> 39:02.878
- We will explain.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.918
- Are you okay Alan?
- Good day?

39:13.160 --> 39:14.115
And school?

39:14.480 --> 39:17.517
Yes, yes. All is well.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.912
There is joy...
Hello, hello...

39:33.640 --> 39:34.755
And there it is...

39:35.120 --> 39:37.350
Oh, it's me.
Mom, it's so beautiful.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.477
Vincent drew it.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.273
Yes, it's me.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.392
- I wish I could die.

39:43.760 --> 39:46.752
- Tell yourself that you have 1 year
less to live.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.512
And now,
the gifts...

39:55.480 --> 39:56.799
This is too cute.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.919
Thank you.
And this is so cute.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.271
- You Alan, what's your gift?

40:09.200 --> 40:11.589
- A scarf
to strangle me...

40:11.840 --> 40:13.034
- But no.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.960
It is worn loose,
vaporous.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.714
Like a caress around your neck.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.474
And that?

40:22.840 --> 40:26.230
- This is to dance with it.
I'll show you.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.709
- Where did you get this?

40:39.080 --> 40:41.878
- I bought it with my pocket money.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.509
- But you're crazy.
You shouldn't have.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.677
Yes, for you, nothing is too beautiful.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.353
Therrre iiiis joyyyy...

41:34.720 --> 41:37.029
- How is it going?
- Hi. You have the music?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.711
- OK. That is good.
Your uncle?

41:40.080 --> 41:41.638
- I am sure he will agree.
- Perfect.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.918
And our reward?

41:46.000 --> 41:47.228
- Patience.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.952
- You want some?
- NO...

41:55.320 --> 41:57.959
- You should. It is good for health.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.850
- Who's is the idiot who told you that?
- My father.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.239
What's wrong with him? Tobacco gives
cancer. You want to die young?

42:03.400 --> 42:04.399
- Well... No.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.275
Then throw it away. It's shit.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.188
Don't move. It will start.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.914
- Come on.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.915
- She is beautiful, eh,
my sister?

44:02.520 --> 44:03.669
- But... But...

44:10.880 --> 44:11.835
But...

44:20.160 --> 44:22.628
Mishima?
What are you doing?

44:23.000 --> 44:24.558
What's going on?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.752
- There is that...

44:30.560 --> 44:32.869
- But... Oh...

44:36.520 --> 44:39.592
There... I am here..
 All is well.

44:50.840 --> 44:53.434
- Hello Sir.  
- Hello children. What brings you here?

44:53.800 --> 44:56.951
- Uncle Dom, we need a favor from you.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.072
- If I can. What kind of favor?

44:59.720 --> 45:02.757
- Well, a big one.
- Very big.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.194
- I am listening to you.

45:06.520 --> 45:07.475
Oh, doctor,

45:07.840 --> 45:10.195
Life is too sad.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.073
Store... with...

45:12.440 --> 45:15.477
We need to kill people...

45:15.720 --> 45:19.190
Suicide rope hara-kiri

45:19.560 --> 45:21.357
and tutti quanti.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.879
- If you only knew
I've had enough of this shit.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.599
- What shit?

45:28.840 --> 45:30.193
The life.

45:30.440 --> 45:33.398
Seppuku-bottle gas

45:33.640 --> 45:35.790
pellets, poison pills.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.990
Good morning, sir, ma'am...

45:42.440 --> 45:45.079
- Stop laughing, you irritate me.

45:50.320 --> 45:51.275
- That's it.

45:51.640 --> 45:54.473
Ah, I understand your confusion,

45:54.720 --> 45:57.996
but if life was funny
We would know it.

45:59.160 --> 46:01.151
Eins, zwei,
three, four...

46:01.520 --> 46:05.308
If life was funny

46:05.680 --> 46:07.796
Well it would be known.

46:09.240 --> 46:12.277
It's like a slice of shit

46:13.880 --> 46:15.711
Buttered on both sides

46:17.040 --> 46:18.393
Overwork
Breaking down

46:18.760 --> 46:22.070
Swamp
I relieve the ravages

46:23.160 --> 46:24.195
Sinking

46:24.560 --> 46:27.552
Overwork
Slavery

46:27.920 --> 46:31.708
I relieve the sinking

46:32.480 --> 46:35.870
You frequent suicide

46:36.560 --> 46:39.711
Therein lies the problem

46:40.840 --> 46:41.590
Helping people

46:41.960 --> 46:43.791
To end their lives

46:44.160 --> 46:46.276
Gets on your nerves.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.154
These short-time customers

46:49.520 --> 46:52.990
Make your life bitter

46:53.360 --> 46:55.157
And you are harassed

46:55.520 --> 46:58.318
Overwork, break up,
swamp

46:58.680 --> 47:02.878
I relieve the ravages
Sinking

47:03.240 --> 47:05.470
Your husband is overworked

47:05.840 --> 47:07.273
He is schizophrenic

47:07.640 --> 47:12.031
He should be bedridden
For at least two weeks

47:12.400 --> 47:15.870
- Two weeks in bed?
What do we do with the store?

47:16.240 --> 47:20.233
- This I do not know,
dear ma'am. It's 250 euros.

47:38.280 --> 47:42.398
- This is a cement cinderblock
provided with a chain

47:42.760 --> 47:44.751
which gets locked
to your ankle.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.715
Go to the edge of a river,
throw it in front of you

47:48.960 --> 47:52.191
You are pulled to the bottom.
And hop! No more worries.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.672
- It doesn't seem bad..

47:56.040 --> 47:57.519
- My husband makes them himself.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.391
well, he made them, poor man.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.352
The name of the shop
is embossed on one side.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.235
- Put your hand.
Yes, I feel it well.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.359
Alright, I'll take that.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.188
- Are you going far?
- Yes... No...

48:15.560 --> 48:16.549
- My son will help you.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.518
Alan? The hand truck.

48:21.040 --> 48:21.950
- You really think...

48:22.320 --> 48:23.753
Ta, ta, ta.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.873
It's the least we can do.
It's as heavy as a dead donkey

48:26.940 --> 48:28.593
that thing.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.270
But... Oh!

48:56.160 --> 48:57.559
My God...

48:59.480 --> 49:00.629
But...

49:30.440 --> 49:31.395
- Well...

49:37.040 --> 49:39.156
- It's high, huh?

49:58.400 --> 50:00.152
Good day, sir.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.198
It is today,
As I tell you,

50:19.560 --> 50:21.152
We win or lose.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.270
It's super!

50:22.640 --> 50:24.517
This afternoon, nothing forbidden.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.952
They will be on their ass.
- Like hell!

50:28.320 --> 50:30.595
- We're going to cut the sausage

50:30.960 --> 50:33.235
We are going to spin the banana

50:34.240 --> 50:36.117
We garden gnomes

50:36.480 --> 50:38.869
We have ideas in the skull

50:39.120 --> 50:41.873
All with me
The big day has come

50:42.240 --> 50:43.355
They will fall

50:43.720 --> 50:44.869
on their ass

50:50.920 --> 50:51.796
Today

50:52.160 --> 50:53.513
I tell you

50:53.880 --> 50:56.394
We win or lose.
This is super!

50:56.760 --> 50:57.636
This afternoon

50:58.000 --> 50:59.797
nothing is forbidden.
They will be

51:00.160 --> 51:00.956
On the ass.
Like hell!

51:02.320 --> 51:04.470
No lack of enthusiasm.

51:04.760 --> 51:07.832
People are dummies.
We condemn them.

51:08.200 --> 51:11.829
Bump off the humdrum.
We are the smartest.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.553
We are Supermen.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.150
All with me
The day has come

51:16.520 --> 51:18.988
Listen to this.
They will be on their ass.

51:19.360 --> 51:20.190
It's too tempting.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.074
Nothing to lose.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.034
It's fun to make a mess.

51:26.400 --> 51:27.276
It's tempting.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.233
It's fun to make a mess.

51:30.600 --> 51:31.749
Too bad,

51:32.120 --> 51:34.714
If it will cost you. The good mood

51:35.080 --> 51:37.116
is on its way.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.755
- Hey...

51:52.120 --> 51:53.235
- So?

51:57.160 --> 51:58.354
- It's up to you.

52:00.560 --> 52:04.030
- Wow...
- So you like it?

52:09.680 --> 52:10.635
- Marilyn, tell me...

52:11.000 --> 52:15.790
where did you get these bubbles?
- Alan gave them to me.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.678
Oh, but...

52:28.640 --> 52:29.595
Shit...

52:32.280 --> 52:34.635
- But what is it?

52:35.960 --> 52:37.154
- Uh, nothing.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.192
- I felt like a slap.

52:41.840 --> 52:42.829
You were dreaming.
Go back to sleep.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.276
- This thing is heavy.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.594
- Come on...
But shut up.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.315
Hide yourself.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.235
- What's this racket?

54:19.040 --> 54:20.314
But what...

54:35.200 --> 54:36.428
- But what's

54:36.800 --> 54:38.836
this thing?
Mom!

54:39.200 --> 54:40.599
What's going on?

54:45.520 --> 54:46.714
- It is Alan.

54:51.040 --> 54:53.713
Vincent, help me!

55:25.400 --> 55:26.355
- In here...

55:31.200 --> 55:33.270
- Attention, behind you...

55:33.640 --> 55:34.834
Attention, Alan!

55:35.960 --> 55:37.313
Give me that!

55:45.000 --> 55:46.149
- Come on guys!

55:57.680 --> 55:58.635
- I got it.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.354
Oh no...

56:05.680 --> 56:07.238
- Come here, you!

56:11.800 --> 56:13.392
Oh no!

56:20.060 --> 56:24.120
Go back home ladies and gentlemen,
We have nothing left to sell.

56:26.320 --> 56:28.595
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

56:28.840 --> 56:32.799
- It's okay Ms. Tuvache, 
we will suicide another time.

56:38.240 --> 56:41.550
- By the way, what do you need?

56:41.800 --> 56:44.997
- Nothing, miss.
Not anymore.

56:46.600 --> 56:50.036
Madam, I ask you
the hand of your daughter.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.152
I don't know her name...

56:52.400 --> 56:53.879
- Marilyn.
- Marilyn.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.714
And with whom I just fell in love,

56:56.960 --> 56:59.315
and who restored my appetite for life.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.515
- Yeah...

57:01.880 --> 57:04.917
- Mom, please,
say yes...

57:06.720 --> 57:11.191
- Well... yes...
But on one condition.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.278
- Anything you want.

57:13.640 --> 57:17.235
That you help us to clean up
all this mess.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.396
- Mom,

57:18.760 --> 57:21.718
I love you.
Me too, I love you.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.589
- I intended to leave this earth

57:36.160 --> 57:37.991
Horrible and evil

57:40.200 --> 57:44.273
To fall asleep with ether

57:44.640 --> 57:48.428
But against all odds

57:48.800 --> 57:52.475
It fell on me

57:53.360 --> 57:58.275
Of course without warning

57:58.640 --> 58:01.029
I never received

58:01.400 --> 58:04.836
Such a look from a girl

58:08.960 --> 58:11.758
- The charms of destiny

58:12.000 --> 58:14.719
have unpredictable twists and turns.

58:17.680 --> 58:21.878
- I saw everything in black

58:22.120 --> 58:25.510
It's nothing to say it.

58:25.880 --> 58:30.510
I was in despair

58:30.880 --> 58:34.634
And who would have predicted

58:35.360 --> 58:37.920
That love would come

58:39.360 --> 58:42.318
In this obscure shop

58:42.680 --> 58:46.070
A cheerful young man

58:48.040 --> 58:49.917
Wearing pretty face

58:55.000 --> 58:57.309
- The charms of destiny

58:57.680 --> 59:00.399
have unpredictable twists and turns.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.230
- No more wasted nights

59:08.200 --> 59:11.237
No more days of suffering

59:12.440 --> 59:14.874
Let's live in the wonder

59:17.040 --> 59:20.794
of a common attraction

59:21.040 --> 59:24.396
All is allowed so long

59:24.760 --> 59:28.594
As love blooms.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.838
Dawn after dawn

59:33.960 --> 59:38.590
Life will follow its course.

59:40.720 --> 59:43.757
The charms of destiny

59:44.000 --> 59:48.437
will perfume our days.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.991
But how did you?

59:54.520 --> 59:56.078
It is so clean

59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.319
we could eat on the floor
- I was going to propose it.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.478
I am Breton and
I make perfect crÃªpes.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.355
How about a crÃªpe picnic
here, right now?

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.551
Oh yes, why not?

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.272
It's delicious.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.392
- It's true, crÃªpes are good.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.594
- You are a real gem.
- You embarrass me.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.791
- He is the perfect man.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.871
What about changing the suicide shop
to a shop for something else?

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.231
- A shop for what?

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.909
- I don't know
we can try.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.633
Anyway the stock is ruined.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.989
We could open a crÃªperie.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.430
- This is an idea.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.071
CrÃªpe evoke mourning.
The clients will not be disoriented.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.037
- What is this shit?

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.719
- I forgot about him!

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.832
-Someone can explain?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.957
- It's me Dad.
Everything is my fault.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.918
Attention, move over!

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.195
Pardon me, madam.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.874
Mishima, stop it now!

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.272
- Calm down, Dad.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.234
- I'll explain.
- You will explain nothing!

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.797
Come here, bastard!

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.548
Mishima, if you kill this child,

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.114
I kill myself!

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.913
Please Mishima...

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.592
- Okay, I made a very
big mistake, I'm sorry...

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.030
I beg your pardon.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.749
I propose a deal.
An honest deal.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.676
You're a great dad,
the best dad.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.835
But you're a serious dad,
too serious. Everybody is.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.752
You never laugh, not even smile.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.273
So if right here, right now
I can make you laugh,

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.868
you forgive me?

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.716
- Bastard, Mishima! You have the death
of this child on your conscience.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.478
Oh no...

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.478
- Assassin!

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.478
- But I... I...

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.194
What...

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.355
- He's alive.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.555
Mom...

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.629
- He's flying.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.435
Ball.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.909
You would like?

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.879
One skull-outbreak,
one!

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.033
The "Red Beard" crÃªpe is for?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.276
- For me!

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.358
- Thank you.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.432
- Hello, it's me again.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.069
- What a good surprise.
What brings you?

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.908
- You would have a...?
- Pardon?

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.589
A cyanide crÃªpe?

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.513
- Do not move.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.155
Hold.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.715
Keep it closed, you fool. If my wife
learnt I still sell those,

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.354
She would kill me.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.517
- How much?
Nothing.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.710
- There is no reason

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.200
- It is in memory of the bad
old times. Good day.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.834
- Thank you.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.275
- Goodbye madam.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.479
- LucrÃ¨ce, I thought about something.
Yes, what?

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.551
- A loyalty card.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.031
because now happy
customers come back.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.999
What do you say?
- Very good idea.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.278
- Arghh...

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.068
We were stupid.
Today everything is clear.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.199
Down with morbidity
Since life is splendid.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.149
Living on homicides
Made us livid

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.279
Let's be lucid
and death to sucide.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.194
- My face of Lent
I'm tired of it.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.752
- There is no problem
He's less white

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.429
I love life and even

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.439
- Vincent, we love you

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.196
- I will write poems

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.429
We repainted the world
In a few seconds

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.153
To no longer see

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.432
All these filthy colors

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.154
You are right Alan, 
We must keep the banana.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:39.359
Death we are condemning.
You see we are gliding.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.518
- It's crazy when you think about it.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.035
A matter of common sense.

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:47.788
Goodbye violence.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.957
Deliverance at last.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:55.234
And therefore
no more suffering

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:59.996
The beautiful life starts

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.913
- For us it's over.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:10.716
We lost it all.
But we get used to it.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.032
If we had known

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:17.278
We would have lived

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.359
As it's evident

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.475
Do not pity us.
You don't know your happiness.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.990
Being passed away

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:31.511
Isn't a happy affair.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.796
An abundance of laughs,
like a perfume

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.627
Which surrounds us.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.555
The dead season
Isn't our kingdom anymore.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:46.392
So we must listen
to all these ghosts.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.470
All together now
Gloom, go home!

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.436
We listen to you, Miss
We trust you.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.360
Be natural,

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.591
and without shades.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:06.750
- Love spellbinds me,
Sweet romance.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.715
- It's the universal

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.709
attraction!

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.150
- No dream

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.272
is impossible.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.471
So long as you believe

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.434
in it strongly.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.316
And if it's sometimes painful,

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.558
Life is always better
than death.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.237
- It's all black,
I'm scared. A match?

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.598
- No, don't do that...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
