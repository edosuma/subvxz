00:00.894 --> 00:03.507
Kids, when you reach your late
20s you might be surprised

00:03.517 --> 00:06.507
to discover you still don't
have life quite figured out.

00:06.517 --> 00:08.084
Like with Aunt Lily.

00:08.093 --> 00:10.197
Even though she was back
from San Francisco,

00:10.207 --> 00:12.264
she was still on a
quest to find herself.

00:12.274 --> 00:15.415
It's just that all I've ever
done is teach kindergarten.

00:15.425 --> 00:17.844
I want to get out there
and change the world.

00:17.854 --> 00:20.407
I want to find my passion.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.081
And she did find it.

00:22.098 --> 00:23.843
I'm going to be a life coach.

00:23.853 --> 00:25.991
In fact,
she found it again and again.

00:26.007 --> 00:28.653
I'm going to be a
marine biologist.

00:29.209 --> 00:31.972
...slam poet.
...beekeeper!

00:32.926 --> 00:34.802
Not a beekeeper.

00:35.418 --> 00:37.680
Her newest lifelong dream?

00:37.695 --> 00:39.810
Singing in a punk rock band.

00:39.828 --> 00:41.593
What is she doing for
money through all this?

00:41.627 --> 00:43.930
Oh, she's been waiting
tables at Big Wave Luau.

00:43.948 --> 00:45.530
Wait, you mean that
Hawaiian place

00:45.548 --> 00:47.750
where they wear those
embarrassing outfits?

00:48.136 --> 00:49.560
No.

00:51.438 --> 00:53.452
Here she comes. Here she comes.

00:53.908 --> 00:57.303
Welcome to Big Wave Luau.
May I tiki your drink order?

00:57.317 --> 00:58.803
Aw, crap.

00:58.818 --> 01:00.130
I'm sorry.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.223
Oh, hi, Lily.
We were just in the neighborhood,

01:02.237 --> 01:04.943
thought we'd get some lunch.
We didn't even know you'd be here.

01:08.117 --> 01:09.352
What do you want?

01:09.367 --> 01:11.300
Oh, I don't think that's
how you're supposed to greet

01:11.335 --> 01:14.323
a customer at Big Wave Luau.

01:17.025 --> 01:19.791
Aloha, island visitors.

01:19.835 --> 01:23.393
The big wave brought
you to our humble luau.

01:23.406 --> 01:27.391
For that, we thank you.
Or in my native tongue, mahalo.

01:28.778 --> 01:31.373
I didn't catch your name.
Did you guys catch her name?

01:31.387 --> 01:32.790
No.

01:32.805 --> 01:34.830
My name is Anuhea.

01:34.848 --> 01:36.851
It means cool and fragrant,

01:36.866 --> 01:39.900
much like any of our
12 specialty drinks.

01:40.606 --> 01:42.273
Robin, nothing to add?

01:42.286 --> 01:45.090
No. Lily is my friend and I'm
not going to make fun of her

01:45.108 --> 01:46.620
for trying to
follow her dreams.

01:46.637 --> 01:48.231
Thank you.

01:48.346 --> 01:50.761
Although, you might want to
bring out the big Hawaiian drum

01:50.777 --> 01:53.300
because I'm pretty sure
today's my birthday.

01:53.317 --> 01:54.850
Birthday girl!

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074

02:08.157 --> 02:11.083
I have never needed beer
more than I do right now.

02:11.095 --> 02:13.303
I thought you said your semester
was gonna be a piece of cake.

02:13.338 --> 02:15.692
I remember because you were eating
a piece of cake at the time

02:15.727 --> 02:18.690
and you said, "Dude,
my semester is gonna be this."

02:18.708 --> 02:19.952
Yeah, well,
it was supposed to be,

02:19.988 --> 02:22.750
but my professor's like the
toughest grader I've ever seen.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.660
She had like a bad
divorce this summer

02:24.678 --> 02:26.600
and now she's taking
it out on us.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.871
To tell you the truth,
I think she just needs to get laid.

02:28.908 --> 02:30.020
Really?

02:30.036 --> 02:31.570
Laid, you say?

02:31.588 --> 02:34.460
You wouldn't be into her.
She's, like, in her late 40s.

02:34.475 --> 02:35.831
She hot?

02:35.847 --> 02:37.701
Yeah, I guess she's
kind of hot, yeah.

02:37.715 --> 02:39.173
And she's looking
for some action.

02:39.186 --> 02:42.520
Sounds to me like she
could be a cougar.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.300
- A what?
- A cougar.

02:44.316 --> 02:46.872
An older woman,
usually in her 40s or 50s,

02:46.886 --> 02:50.173
single and on the prowl
for a younger man.

02:50.188 --> 02:53.412
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s--
a turtle?

02:53.686 --> 02:56.890
Marshall, I've thought it over
and I accept your challenge.

02:56.905 --> 03:00.830
- I didn't challenge you to have sex...
- Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.

03:01.686 --> 03:03.903
So, I quit my job.

03:03.998 --> 03:05.600
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

03:05.615 --> 03:09.292
Approximately 50 times a day,
some guy asks me for a lei...

03:09.306 --> 03:10.851
Classic.

03:10.875 --> 03:14.160
Ted, didn't you tell me they need
a new assistant in your office?

03:14.437 --> 03:15.632
Yeah.

03:15.647 --> 03:17.760
Somebody did just quit.

03:17.775 --> 03:20.261
So, where should we eat today?

03:21.887 --> 03:25.532
Oh awesome,
you brought lunch for everyone?

03:31.305 --> 03:33.882
Dude, that is cold-blooded.

03:33.897 --> 03:35.650
It was an honest mistake.

03:35.666 --> 03:38.640
Look,  when somebody opens up a
container with an entire chicken in it,

03:38.656 --> 03:41.272
it's okay to assume they
made lunch for everyone.

03:41.286 --> 03:43.760
Ted, that girl didn't quit.
You destroyed her.

03:43.775 --> 03:46.461
It was an whole chicken.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.041
And did I mention
she had 12 sides?

03:48.055 --> 03:51.263
Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure.
Real classy, Ted.

03:51.276 --> 03:53.753
So, Lily, what do you say?
Do you want the job?

03:53.768 --> 03:55.262
What would I be doing?

03:55.278 --> 03:57.860
Basically, you're sort of
a general office assistant.

03:57.877 --> 04:00.783
You'll sit there.
My station is right over here.

04:00.795 --> 04:02.462
And things are a little
bit crazy right now

04:02.497 --> 04:04.562
'cause we're pitching a new
building to a big client.

04:04.597 --> 04:06.771
- Oh, right, is that the...
- Yeah.

04:06.786 --> 04:08.420
Here's the model.

04:10.445 --> 04:14.440
You weren't kidding.
It really does look like a giant penis.

04:14.456 --> 04:15.513
I know.

04:15.528 --> 04:18.132
For whatever reason, Mr.
Druthers just doesn't see it.

04:18.144 --> 04:19.630
How can he not see it?

04:19.647 --> 04:21.062
- I mean there's the...
- I know.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.603
- And the way it...
- I know.

04:22.617 --> 04:25.051
- And the two little...
- I know.

04:25.065 --> 04:28.220
- Wow, it is just...
- Spectacular?

04:28.236 --> 04:29.623
Why, thank you.

04:29.638 --> 04:32.140
Lily, this is Mr. Druthers,
the head architect on the project.

04:32.155 --> 04:34.063
Lily's going to be our
new office assistant.

04:34.075 --> 04:36.060
- Ah.
- Nice to meet you.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.551
Isn't it?

04:37.567 --> 04:40.461
Ted, I looked at your design
for the penthouse balcony.

04:40.476 --> 04:43.810
Tell me,
do you want to be an architect?

04:43.896 --> 04:46.752
I, uh... I am an architect.

04:46.768 --> 04:47.993
Really?

04:48.008 --> 04:50.923
Well, my six-year-old
nephew plays with Legos.

04:50.935 --> 04:53.181
Is he an architect?

04:53.276 --> 04:57.483
Well, not unless he somehow
passed all his licensing exams.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.690
Ted, you've got promise.

04:59.705 --> 05:02.162
But you have to study
what I do more carefully.

05:02.177 --> 05:05.850
Now I want you to design
some Styrofoam trees

05:05.867 --> 05:07.623
for the building model.

05:07.636 --> 05:09.713
- Think you can handle that?
- Absolutely.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.702
Good. So you're going
to design the...

05:13.715 --> 05:16.750
- Styrofoam trees.
- Once again-- with feeling.

05:17.645 --> 05:20.813
- Styrofoam trees.
- Styrofoam trees!

05:20.828 --> 05:22.901
- Styrofoam trees!
- That's the spirit.

05:22.918 --> 05:24.552
Now, gather 'round.

05:28.298 --> 05:31.880
This isn't just about trees, Ted.
This is about life.

05:31.897 --> 05:35.682
And sometimes in life,
you have to get the trees just right

05:35.696 --> 05:37.580
or you're fired, hmm?

05:41.775 --> 05:45.123
Man, that guy is
a total, well...

05:49.365 --> 05:51.961
Okay,  wait, wait, wait.
That's Professor Lewis's office there.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.260
Okay, let's take a look.

05:56.906 --> 06:00.791
Oh, yeah,
it's a cougar all right.

06:01.017 --> 06:03.021
A prime specimen.

06:03.545 --> 06:07.870
See,  you can identify a cougar
by a few key characteristics.

06:07.885 --> 06:09.472
Start with the hair.

06:09.488 --> 06:11.810
The cougar keeps up
with current hairstyles

06:11.828 --> 06:14.020
as a form of camouflage.

06:14.036 --> 06:16.910
The prey may not realize
that he's engaged a cougar

06:16.926 --> 06:19.431
until he's already
being dragged, helpless,

06:19.445 --> 06:21.021
back to her lair.

06:21.835 --> 06:23.472
Now, the blouse.

06:23.485 --> 06:26.441
The cougar displays
maximum cleavage possible

06:26.458 --> 06:28.790
to captivate her prey.

06:29.045 --> 06:31.002
If you're watching them bounce,

06:31.016 --> 06:33.282
she's about to pounce.

06:33.598 --> 06:35.330
See the claws?

06:35.343 --> 06:37.951
Long and sharp,

06:37.967 --> 06:40.383
to ward off rival females...

06:40.399 --> 06:42.842
or open alimony checks.

06:43.767 --> 06:47.280
Yeah, this one's a beaut.

06:50.288 --> 06:53.643
Okay, let the hunt begin.

06:53.658 --> 06:55.821
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not so sure I'm comfortable

06:55.837 --> 06:58.840
with you hunting my
constitutional law professor.

06:58.857 --> 07:01.720
Who do you rather have
grading your papers--

07:01.735 --> 07:05.560
a savage,
man-eating jungle cat,

07:05.577 --> 07:09.461
or a purring, satisfied kitty?

07:11.975 --> 07:13.470
Go, Barney.

07:13.487 --> 07:16.613
Go mount and stuff that cougar.

07:19.358 --> 07:24.133
Scusi, I am Luigi,
Italian exchange student.

07:24.146 --> 07:27.860
I was, uh, walking to class,

07:27.877 --> 07:30.781
but then I noticed you...

07:30.938 --> 07:33.080
bella principessa...

07:33.097 --> 07:35.503
Tell me what you
want or get out.

07:35.677 --> 07:36.893
Direct.

07:36.906 --> 07:38.532
I like that.

07:38.548 --> 07:40.142
The name's Barney.

07:40.155 --> 07:43.540
What I want... is you.

07:46.057 --> 07:48.002
Turn around.

07:50.028 --> 07:52.513
My place. Two hours.

07:53.297 --> 07:54.842
Don't be tardy.

07:57.087 --> 08:00.162
I can't believe how Mr.
Druthers treats people.

08:00.176 --> 08:03.532
And that building?
Talk about overcompensating.

08:03.545 --> 08:04.962
He's not usually this bad.

08:04.976 --> 08:06.510
It's just that the partners
have made it very clear

08:06.547 --> 08:08.392
this project is make
or break for us,

08:08.408 --> 08:10.702
so lately he's been
a little testy.

08:11.766 --> 08:14.110
You know what I
mean-- crotchety.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.742
I'm just saying it's
been hard on him.

08:17.755 --> 08:19.531
All right stop.

08:20.027 --> 08:22.381
- Did you show Lily your design?
- No.

08:22.397 --> 08:23.970
- What design?
- It's nothing.

08:23.985 --> 08:25.353
It's fantastic.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.760
Just for fun,
Ted's been working on his own design.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.300
And it doesn't look at
all like male genitalia.

08:30.315 --> 08:33.051
At least,
not healthy male genitalia.

08:33.066 --> 08:35.480
Ted, you should pitch your
building to Druthers.

08:35.496 --> 08:37.832
Are you kidding?
He's Hammond Druthers.

08:37.845 --> 08:40.381
He's a legend.
I'm just part of his team.

08:40.398 --> 08:41.740
This building is
huge for the firm,

08:41.777 --> 08:44.071
so it's really important
we don't blow it.

08:44.487 --> 08:46.452
All right, enough.

08:47.328 --> 08:51.323
Oh, my God. Incredible.

08:51.387 --> 08:54.280
Hmm... C-minus.

08:55.385 --> 08:58.100
C-minus? What are
you talking about?

08:58.118 --> 09:00.610
I just pulled an all-nighter!

09:00.788 --> 09:03.020
You didn't budget
your time well,

09:03.036 --> 09:05.961
you glossed over some of
the most important points,

09:05.977 --> 09:09.273
and your oral presentation
was sloppy and inconclusive.

09:11.727 --> 09:14.321
Mr. Druthers asked if
you were making the trees

09:14.337 --> 09:17.003
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.

09:17.537 --> 09:20.693
Then he stared at
me until I laughed.

09:20.706 --> 09:22.881
Okay, I'm done.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.192
Great. I'll put the paints away.
You just go show him.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.810
Great. Thanks.

09:28.438 --> 09:30.342
Well, finally.

09:30.356 --> 09:32.983
I wondered whether you
were making the trees

09:32.998 --> 09:36.062
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.

09:38.608 --> 09:40.501
Good one, sir.

09:40.678 --> 09:42.711
Anyway, here they are.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.491
- Too green.
- Too green?

09:47.506 --> 09:50.471
Yes,  the leaves should really be
more of a natural brown color.

09:50.486 --> 09:51.832
Almost brunette.

09:51.847 --> 09:56.041
And think bushier.
I want this tower to rise

09:56.056 --> 10:00.190
from a thicket of wild,
ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.

10:00.206 --> 10:02.241
Can you picture it, Ted?

10:02.257 --> 10:04.542
I can't un-picture it.

10:04.557 --> 10:06.291
Good.

10:07.257 --> 10:09.131
Oh, my God.

10:09.146 --> 10:10.232
It's gone!

10:10.247 --> 10:11.923
What? What's gone?

10:11.935 --> 10:15.731
My baseball signed three
times by Pete Rose.

10:15.768 --> 10:18.322
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

10:18.338 --> 10:19.612
What do you think, Ted,

10:19.628 --> 10:23.382
it just let itself out of its
plastic case and rolled away?

10:23.397 --> 10:25.371
Somebody stole it.

10:25.387 --> 10:28.493
Well, um, I better get back
to these Styrofoam trees.

10:28.506 --> 10:30.570
Oh, who cares about the trees?

10:30.587 --> 10:34.091
It's just busy work to make you
feel like you're contributing.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.411
Inspiring as always, sir.

10:37.788 --> 10:39.290
Lily?

10:41.705 --> 10:43.892
Where's she put those paints?

10:58.457 --> 10:59.650
Hey.

10:59.667 --> 11:03.352
Hey. Um, Lily,
question for you.

11:03.367 --> 11:05.333
Why did I find 
Mr. Druthers' baseball

11:05.347 --> 11:08.231
signed three times by Pete
Rose in your desk drawer?

11:08.248 --> 11:10.150
That's easy. I took it.

11:10.167 --> 11:11.152
Why?

11:11.167 --> 11:12.873
It's simple.

11:13.048 --> 11:16.473
I can't believe there's no
horseradish for the roast beef.

11:16.487 --> 11:20.780
I guess you were sick the day they
taught that at Sandwich University.

11:24.496 --> 11:28.481
Mother, no one from the nursing
home is stealing from you.

11:28.496 --> 11:31.442
I didn't get you a
birthday present.

11:37.786 --> 11:40.360
What? You gonna cry?

11:40.828 --> 11:43.053
Little crybaby's going to cry?

11:43.068 --> 11:44.570
Hey, everybody, look!

11:44.588 --> 11:47.892
The little crybaby's gonna cry!

11:50.036 --> 11:52.533
I lost my ice cream!

11:53.218 --> 11:56.051
Okay, I may have
exaggerated that last one,

11:56.067 --> 11:58.853
but the point is, he was mean.

11:58.866 --> 12:01.193
And that's why I
took away his ball.

12:01.338 --> 12:03.502
What does his ball have
to do with anything?

12:03.515 --> 12:06.463
Druthers has to be taught
he can't behave like that.

12:06.478 --> 12:09.371
When I was teaching kindergarten,
whenever a kid was mean,

12:09.388 --> 12:11.422
I would take away
one of his toys.

12:11.438 --> 12:13.320
The kid would be
upset at first,

12:13.336 --> 12:16.023
but then he'd learn
to stop being mean.

12:16.037 --> 12:17.641
Hey, guys. What's going on?

12:17.655 --> 12:20.663
Lily stole my boss' baseball
signed three times by Pete Rose.

12:20.675 --> 12:22.391
Why? Was he being mean?

12:22.406 --> 12:23.962
- You know about this?
- Yeah.

12:23.978 --> 12:26.272
It's her own personal
form of justice.

12:26.285 --> 12:28.051
Did you tell him about
that time at the Gap?

12:28.066 --> 12:29.270
Oh, that was a good one.

12:29.288 --> 12:31.231
This sales guy
was rude to Robin,

12:31.248 --> 12:32.800
so I took a pair of khakis.

12:32.816 --> 12:34.823
I gave them to you
for your birthday.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.011
So I've been walking
around in stolen khakis?

12:37.025 --> 12:39.791
I prefer to call them
"justice khakis."

12:39.805 --> 12:42.511
That's not justice.
It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.

12:42.525 --> 12:44.351
So is being mean.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.522
Lily, your little system
doesn't even make sense.

12:46.537 --> 12:48.710
In kindergarten,
the kid knew why he was being punished.

12:48.745 --> 12:50.910
Druthers just thinks
someone stole his ball.

12:50.928 --> 12:52.740
Well, that's why I left a note.

12:52.756 --> 12:54.241
- A note?
- Yeah.

12:54.258 --> 12:57.130
When  he finds it, he'll understand
why his ball was taken away,

12:57.145 --> 12:58.680
he'll stop being mean,

12:58.697 --> 13:01.220
and the office will be
a nicer place to work.

13:01.237 --> 13:04.173
Maybe he'll even be open
to hearing your ideas.

13:04.186 --> 13:06.262
Look, Lil, we're all tolerating

13:06.275 --> 13:09.062
this prolonged nervous
breakdown you're clearly having,

13:09.078 --> 13:12.160
with the punk band and the
beekeeping and the petty larceny,

13:12.176 --> 13:14.613
but this is my career
you're messing with.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.933
I'm not sure I like your tone.

13:16.946 --> 13:18.511
You know what?

13:18.527 --> 13:20.671
Now you just lost the ball.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.290
Hey.

13:25.407 --> 13:28.442
I'd ask you how last night went,
but we had a pop quiz today.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.391
Nobody got higher
than a C-minus.

13:30.405 --> 13:32.210
I know, I know.

13:32.226 --> 13:33.731
You claim to have so much sex.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.882
I only assumed
you'd be good at it.

13:35.897 --> 13:38.231
Look, I miscalculated.

13:38.247 --> 13:42.003
I thought she'd be old and fragile,
like most cougars.

13:42.017 --> 13:44.191
But kitty's got claws.

13:44.385 --> 13:45.953
Don't worry though.

13:45.967 --> 13:47.322
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.

13:47.336 --> 13:49.631
Just let it go, man.
You're making things worse.

13:49.645 --> 13:53.193
I promise you, after tonight,
that cougar will be my pet,

13:53.208 --> 13:55.911
and I its master.

13:56.088 --> 13:59.402
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

14:00.068 --> 14:03.150
Oh, God.
That wasn't your first time, was it?

14:04.027 --> 14:06.761
Although that would
explain a lot.

14:06.977 --> 14:10.232
What? No. We had sex yesterday.

14:10.247 --> 14:12.982
Oh, right. That.

14:13.817 --> 14:16.363
Well, you had sex yesterday.

14:16.378 --> 14:19.273
I revised my syllabus
for the spring semester.

14:22.706 --> 14:24.242
When Druthers goes
to get his bagel,

14:24.256 --> 14:26.671
I'll go in, grab the note,
put the ball back.

14:26.686 --> 14:28.301
If something goes wrong,

14:28.316 --> 14:30.823
yell out, "Who wants espresso?"

14:30.837 --> 14:32.880
so I'll know he's coming.
Got it?

14:32.898 --> 14:34.292
Okay, now give me the ball.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.421
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

14:36.436 --> 14:38.841
I mean I stand by
what I did, Ted.

14:38.855 --> 14:41.070
Come on, Lily.
We're running out of time.

14:41.085 --> 14:44.012
Everybody get in here now!

14:44.417 --> 14:46.743
Who wants espresso?

14:52.417 --> 14:54.001
Now, as most of you know,

14:54.016 --> 14:57.740
my Pete Rose, Pete Rose,
Pete Rose baseball has been stolen.

14:57.756 --> 14:59.291
Well, I just found this note.

14:59.305 --> 15:03.931
"Dear Mr.
Druthers, I, your baseball, am leaving.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.252
Maybe, if you start being nice,
I'll come back.

15:06.267 --> 15:09.520
If not, other things in your
office may follow my lead.

15:09.538 --> 15:12.401
In fact,
I overheard your iPod talking,

15:12.416 --> 15:15.791
and he may shuffle
off at any minute."

15:16.416 --> 15:20.123
Normally, I would scream at
everyone until my voice goes,

15:20.137 --> 15:23.741
but maybe that's the
wrong reaction here.

15:23.758 --> 15:25.121
Interesting.

15:25.137 --> 15:28.860
Instead, I'm giving my baseball
until the end of the day

15:28.876 --> 15:31.363
to decide he's homesick,

15:31.377 --> 15:34.603
or, tomorrow morning,
I'll begin firing three people an hour.

15:34.618 --> 15:38.572
And, if the thief
doesn't believe me, well,

15:38.587 --> 15:41.691
then you are gambling
more than Pete Rose--

15:41.706 --> 15:43.590
major league baseball's
all-time hit leader,

15:43.605 --> 15:46.170
a man whose absence from the
Hall of Fame is a travesty

15:46.186 --> 15:50.930
to the entire sports world--
ever "allegedly" did!

15:52.628 --> 15:55.592
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.

15:57.335 --> 16:00.311
Give him his ball
back right now.

16:00.325 --> 16:01.762
People are going to get fired.

16:01.778 --> 16:04.713
No, they're not.
It's just a tantrum, Ted.

16:04.728 --> 16:06.891
I saw this in kindergarten
all the time.

16:06.905 --> 16:08.381
This isn't kindergarten.

16:08.398 --> 16:11.782
Mr. Druthers is an adult,
and he wants his ball back.

16:11.798 --> 16:15.072
All right, I'll give it back
if you show him your plans.

16:15.086 --> 16:17.252
No. You'll give it
back or you're fired.

16:17.266 --> 16:18.793
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just can't do that.

16:18.807 --> 16:21.011
Then you're fired.

16:21.527 --> 16:23.453
Fine.

16:24.785 --> 16:26.610
Here's the ball.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.653
At least you have one now.

16:33.185 --> 16:35.060
Dude, you're killing me.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.722
You didn't tame the cougar.
You just made her angrier.

16:38.735 --> 16:42.380
Do you not see the
PowerBar in my hand?

16:42.396 --> 16:44.272
I'm fueling up.

16:44.285 --> 16:46.241
So you're going
back over there?

16:46.257 --> 16:47.370
Oh, yeah.

16:47.387 --> 16:50.122
And tonight,
just like John Mellencamp,

16:50.137 --> 16:53.860
I am going to get rid of the
"Cougar" once and for all.

16:54.307 --> 16:55.610
Get it?

16:55.625 --> 16:58.061
'Cause that's what he
did with his name.

17:08.845 --> 17:10.663
I can't stop
thinking about you.

17:10.676 --> 17:12.630
Please give me another chance.

17:12.645 --> 17:14.060
Barney, I teach all day.

17:14.077 --> 17:16.742
It's the last thing I want
to do when I get home.

17:17.288 --> 17:19.911
But you don't understand.
See, I've been going easy on you,

17:19.928 --> 17:23.111
holding back, 'cause I was afraid
you'd break a hip or something.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.363
But, this time, no mercy.
I don't care how long it takes--

17:25.397 --> 17:29.461
days, weeks, half a year.

17:30.478 --> 17:32.621
Fine. Come in.

17:32.638 --> 17:35.692
You can start while I
finish grading some papers.

17:37.827 --> 17:40.610
Hurry up.
Clients will be here any moment.

17:40.628 --> 17:43.180
Now, slide it closer
to his chair.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.793
I want this thing to really
smack him in the face.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.283
Mr. Druthers, thank you again
for understanding about Lily.

17:50.298 --> 17:52.590
Oh. Well, I pity her.

17:52.607 --> 17:56.482
I mean, to steal from my office and
then write that slanderous note...

17:56.496 --> 18:00.451
You might say that Lily
was mentally deranged.

18:00.555 --> 18:03.060
You might say that, Ted.

18:05.747 --> 18:07.663
Lily was mentally deranged.

18:07.675 --> 18:11.933
You might even say it loud
enough for everyone to hear.

18:12.866 --> 18:15.120
Lily was mentally deranged!

18:15.136 --> 18:19.480
Oh! That's a bit harsh,
don't you think, Ted?

18:20.285 --> 18:21.732
The clients are here.

18:21.747 --> 18:23.443
Excellent. Bring them in.

18:23.458 --> 18:27.820
Our client was a major bank and
financial services company in Spokane.

18:27.838 --> 18:30.173
They wanted a modern
skyscraper that still captured

18:30.187 --> 18:33.123
the distinct flavor and
history of the Northwest.

18:33.135 --> 18:35.953
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

18:35.965 --> 18:39.681
the Spokane National
Bank Building.

18:42.235 --> 18:44.671
That's a penis!

18:46.338 --> 18:48.880
That's... that's ridiculous.

18:48.896 --> 18:51.902
There's no way this majestic
tower can be confused

18:51.915 --> 18:54.643
with the male organ of love.

18:54.656 --> 18:56.853
We're  not building a penis.

18:57.017 --> 18:59.501
You got any other ideas?

18:59.988 --> 19:02.141
Other ideas?

19:02.157 --> 19:04.292
You said you wanted
Hammond Druthers.

19:04.306 --> 19:07.002
This is Hammond Druthers.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.910
Well, hats off to
your ladyfriends,

19:09.925 --> 19:12.263
but I'm not building it.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.443
We're done here.

19:14.757 --> 19:17.683
The trajectory of my entire
career might have been different

19:17.697 --> 19:21.663
had I not unwittingly worn
my justice khakis that day.

19:21.678 --> 19:23.233
Wait!

19:24.465 --> 19:26.470
We have one more idea for you.

19:26.485 --> 19:28.351
Ted, what are you doing?

19:28.367 --> 19:29.813
I have another design.

19:29.828 --> 19:32.123
Sit down, shut up right now.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.493
No.

19:33.505 --> 19:37.462
# Thank you for the invitation #

19:37.478 --> 19:40.172
# She showed me very nice... #

19:40.186 --> 19:43.012
To Ted! The youngest person
to ever design a building

19:43.025 --> 19:45.893
over 70 stories probably!

19:45.907 --> 19:48.351
Probably!

19:49.028 --> 19:50.640
Congrats, Ted.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.283
Hey, thanks for telling me
to stand up to Druthers

19:53.296 --> 19:54.861
and pitch my idea.

19:54.878 --> 19:57.590
Seriously, none of this would have
happened if it weren't for you.

19:57.605 --> 19:59.913
Oh. You know what, Ted?

19:59.925 --> 20:01.413
That was very nice.

20:01.428 --> 20:04.272
You have earned
these screws back.

20:04.287 --> 20:07.660
Don't sit in your desk chair
until you've put them back in.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.483
Hey, I'm project manager now,

20:10.495 --> 20:12.703
so, if you want your
old job back...

20:12.716 --> 20:14.233
No, thanks.

20:14.245 --> 20:18.042
I think I figured out what
I want to be when I grow up.

20:19.986 --> 20:24.250
Casey, that's not
how we treat people.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.581
You'll get this back when
you learn to be nice.

20:39.046 --> 20:41.853
- Barney! Oh, my God!
- What happened?

20:42.696 --> 20:44.972
He broke his hip.

20:45.647 --> 20:49.670
That's not true.
It's just temporarily dislocated.

20:49.685 --> 20:50.862
Seriously, I'm fine.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.041
No, he's not fine.

20:53.057 --> 20:54.853
Professor Lewis, hi.

20:54.865 --> 20:58.253
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.
I graded your paper tonight.

20:58.268 --> 21:01.453
I was pleasantly surprised.

21:01.466 --> 21:03.561
Yeah, she was.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.582
B-plus.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.031
B-plus?!

21:08.046 --> 21:11.690
Marshall, after I've gone through
my eight weeks of physical therapy,

21:11.706 --> 21:14.220
I am going to get you that "A"!

21:14.465 --> 21:16.093
Let her go.

21:16.105 --> 21:19.753
She belongs out
there in the wild.

21:19.765 --> 21:21.621
You should feel proud.

21:21.637 --> 21:25.043
You fought the
cougar and lived.

21:25.088 --> 21:27.801
It was an amazing safari.

21:27.815 --> 21:31.193
I can't wait to show
you guys the slides.

21:31.666 --> 21:35.243
