00:01.700 --> 00:06.190
most recently, I gave man-birthto a
weighty tome called "god hates us all,"

00:06.200 --> 00:10.390
which was turned into a movie called
"a crazy little thingcalled love.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.290
" You startedwhen you cheated on me.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.390
Cheating isn't just
aboutfucking someone.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.990
Are you trying to make methrow up now?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.290
Happy endings may get a
bad rap,but they do happen.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.390
It is possible maybe one day
youand mom could get back together?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.890
Anything's possible.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.790
Get on with your life and forget about
the womanyou didn't want to marry.

Moody.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.990
Hi, sis.What's up?

01:51.000 --> 01:56.190
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.390
Pop.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.490
Hey, kiddo.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.289
On time, as always.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.090
Sorry, I had a late shoot last night.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.190
How was the flight?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.090
Bumpy as fuck, but the cocktails helped.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.290
So did business class,
thank you very much.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.890
- A guy could get used to that kind of thing.
- you***

02:19.900 --> 02:24.490
Not only is it a better meal,
it's a better class of stewardess.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.490
You should have seen the one I had.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.290
Sweet jesus, guide me.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.790
I think they call them
"flight attendants" now.

02:30.800 --> 02:35.690
She had tits out to here, legs for
days, an ass like a 10-year-old boy.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.090
Goddamn.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.390
That's pretty.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.990
What kind of floweris that?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.190
That's a, uh,purple
-- purple flower.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.290
Nobody likes a smartass.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.890
I don't havea fucking clue,

02:46.900 --> 02:50.990
which never seemsto stop you from
asking meevery other goddamn time.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.290
Watch your mouth.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.990
It's kind of crazyfor me lately.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.690
I don't really have timeto
stop and smell the flowers

02:57.700 --> 03:00.390
and then look uptheir
proper names online.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.790
You find any timeto get married?

03:02.800 --> 03:05.090
No.Still living in sin.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.390
Your poor mother.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.490
She's dead, pop.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.690
I know.She's probably doing
somersaultsin her grave right now.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.090
shit.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.490
What do you think?

03:16.900 --> 03:18.690
It's pretty fancy, kid.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.290
Sure you can afford it?

03:20.300 --> 03:22.190
Don't sweat it.I'll be fine.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.390
If you say so.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.690
Okay, so who do I have to fuckto
get a cocktail around here?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.690
So, what are your thoughtson rehab?

03:36.100 --> 03:39.090
Rehab is for quitters.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.390
Come on.Come on!

03:43.400 --> 03:45.490
I don't know your name.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.590
You haven't asked.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.490
Well, let's not standon ceremony.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.090
- Trixie.
- Trixie?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.390
That is a terrific name...

03:55.400 --> 03:57.090
if you're a hooker.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.290
What makes you thinkI'm not a hooker?

04:02.300 --> 04:06.090
Well, for one,you're far too beautiful.

04:06.300 --> 04:11.190
And secondly, even if youwere
a street-walkin' cheetah,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.490
I would get youto give it to me gratis.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.490
Oh, you think so, huh?

04:14.500 --> 04:16.589
I have never paid for sexin my life.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.490
I doubt that.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.490
Oh, speakof the she-devil.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.190
- Hey.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.190
We're trying to determine if
she is a professionalsex worker.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.090
How nice for you both.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.890
I need youto come with me.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.690
And I need to usethe restroom.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.690
You do that.Chicks with
small bladdersare hot.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.590
- Thanks.
- To be continued.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.590
So,your sister called.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.390
Well, I figured she would.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.390
Hank, I'm so sorry.

04:50.100 --> 04:56.190
Well, I don't knowwhat to do with
that exactly, but thank you, I guess.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.890
Do you want to getout of here?

04:58.900 --> 05:01.390
Yeah.Where?

05:01.400 --> 05:02.590
Home.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.690
Oh, home.That sounds nice.

05:05.700 --> 05:11.290
But where is that exactly
--home?Your home?My home?Our home?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.490
Hank,I got you a ticket.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.390
I hope that's fully
refundablebecause I ain't going.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.190
You're not goingto your dad's funeral?

05:19.200 --> 05:20.790
He was a fucking asshole.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.690
Come on, hank,you don't mean that.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.290
Don't tell me what I mean.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.090
Don't try to mother me.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.390
Half the time you actlike you
don't give a shit.Now you care?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.690
I've always cared.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.090
It's easy to say.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.190
Hi.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.290
Sir
trix-a-lot.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.090
- Want to getout of here?
- Sure.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.090
Meter's running.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.690
The meter's running.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.690
What shouldwe name him?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.890
I know --let's
call him "love.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.390
" A crazy little thingcalled love.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.090
And...cut!

05:56.100 --> 05:57.390
That was fucking cash!

05:57.400 --> 05:58.890
Carr, what the fuck?

05:58.900 --> 05:59.890
"What the fuck" what?

05:59.900 --> 06:01.890
I think my rectumjust prolapsed.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.290
What's withthe fucking dialogue?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.390
They rewrote it
themselvesin the trailer.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.590
He thought we could endon the kiss.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.490
What do you think?

06:08.500 --> 06:11.790
I think the man is money and we should
listento whatever the fuck he says.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.990
If he wants to tuck his
magicalmovie-star cock

06:14.000 --> 06:15.490
between his legs and
do the pee-pee dance,

06:15.500 --> 06:16.790
I'm putting that on film, too.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.090
And I would wait on lineto see it.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.990
Meanwhile, you're turningmy
movie into a piece of shit.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.890
Your book, my movie.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.790
Don't be a backseat director,moody.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.390
All due respect, sir,but
your boy is exhausting.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.090
Tell me about it.Drove
us all batshit growing up.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.590
That was fantastic,guys.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.590
I hate that runty littlemotherfucker.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.490
I don't know, seemed likea
nice enough guy to me.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.890
Very charismatic.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.790
I liked himin that vietnam
movie.He played a good cripple.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.190
Pop, when there'sno more room in hell
and the devil himselfwalks the earth,

06:49.200 --> 06:53.390
don't you thinkhe'll be playing cripples
and charming his wayinto the pants of many?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.890
I'm proud of you, kid.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.590
- Why?
- Why?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.590
This is the american dreamright here.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.390
Your name is going to be upon the
silver screen.You'll be immortal.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.690
I've writtena couple books, too.They'll
be aroundlong after I'm gone.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.790
That's not the same.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.590
You haven't read them.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.590
Your mother filled me
in.It's too many words for me.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.390
You know who's a good
writer?James patterson.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.590
I read one of his bookson the plane.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.090
Hank moody.

07:16.100 --> 07:20.090
- Amber, hi.How are you?
- Good.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.890
This is amber.She's in the film.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.890
Amber,this is my old man, al.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.390
So nice to meet you.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.390
The moodiestof the moodys.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.190
I see the apple doesn't
fallfar from the tree.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.590
Come see me?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.490
I've got some thoughts.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.190
Okay, couple minutes?

07:34.200 --> 07:35.190
Cool.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.790
Oh, I've gotsome
thoughts, too --

07:36.800 --> 07:40.290
some thoughtsthat are making it
just a little bit crowdedin my pants.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.390
What's the story,morning glory?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.990
Whoa.Settle down.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.890
I'm a happily non-married man.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.190
I always wanted to do that.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.590
Fuck, that's good.Funny.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.790
Good for you.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.590
Who says americaisn't
the land of opportunity?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.390
Yep,another $10 dream come true.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.190
It's gonna cost youa
little more than that.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.490
Stop that!

08:09.500 --> 08:11.690
Maybe I should do oneoff your rib cage.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.690
As you wish.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.590
So, what are yourunning from?

08:17.100 --> 08:20.490
Oh, please.No one holes upin a hotel
room with a hookerand a pile of blow

08:20.500 --> 08:22.490
without being on the runfrom something.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.490
Stop jokingabout the hooker stuff.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.690
You're making me paranoid.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.390
Maybe it's the blow.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.890
I'm not joking.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.990
- Yes, you are.
- No.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.289
Oh, come on.Really?Let
me get this straight --

08:39.299 --> 08:45.090
your name is trixie and
you are in facta whore?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.190
My name is beatrice.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.190
My parents thought it would
becute to call me "trixie."

08:50.900 --> 08:52.090
They still thinkit's cute?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.790
They're dead.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.090
Well, here's a thought.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.890
Why don'T...

09:00.800 --> 09:03.890
I do you this time,and
then we call it even?

09:04.300 --> 09:05.890
Well, you can dowhatever you want,

09:05.900 --> 09:08.590
but you're still gonna geta
bill for services rendered.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.290
What about the blow?I paid
for the blowand you partook.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.890
Doesn't that get mea discount?

09:12.900 --> 09:13.990
Sorry, sweetie.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.390
What about the sex itself?

09:15.600 --> 09:18.790
Was that -- I mean,
how --how -- mm-hmm?

09:18.800 --> 09:22.490
Well, I would be lyingif I didn't say that
there were moments thatI thought to myself,

09:22.500 --> 09:25.690
"whore, this isn't sucha
bad way to earn a living.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.690
" Okay,why don't we just call it
"casual sexbetween consenting adults"?

09:30.700 --> 09:33.590
Why don't you just pay
me,and I'll be on my way?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.490
Because then I'd miss you.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.290
You can't snort a line
of cokeoff a woman's ass

09:37.300 --> 09:38.990
and not wonderabout
her hopes and dreams.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.390
It's not gentlemanly.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.590
If you want to keep meon the clock, I'll
tell you whatI wanted to be when I grew up.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.190
Okay.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.790
You take diner's club?

10:00.500 --> 10:03.190
I'm not
kidding.I don't --

10:03.200 --> 10:04.990
I don't have any cash.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.590
You don't have any cash?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.790
I got the one.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.590
How's the world'ssexiest
architect doing?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.790
- Grandpa!

10:15.800 --> 10:18.890
Your mother happens to
bea world-class beauty.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.190
Too good for this mutt fatherof yours.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.890
I'm remodeling a placein venice.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.690
The client wants itall green.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.390
Painted green?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.390
Who is he --the
jolly green giant?

10:29.100 --> 10:31.490
You have no ideahow close
you are to the truth.

10:31.500 --> 10:37.790
You should meet this guy.He's
a total dial tone.Just A...

10:39.200 --> 10:41.690
He's paying me very well.

10:41.700 --> 10:45.890
He's got great taste,and he's not
an earth-hater.What's not to like?

10:45.900 --> 10:48.490
Maybe the fact that he seems
tohave a huge crush on you.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.290
Oh, please.***

10:50.300 --> 10:51.790
Becca agrees with me.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.990
He does get a little
goofyaround you, mom.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.290
***

10:55.300 --> 10:56.890
See?He gets goofyaround you.

10:56.900 --> 11:01.190
What about all those
actresseson your set***?

11:01.200 --> 11:03.190
Oh, come on.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.890
Yeah, I think I metone of those today.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.190
You better be careful,karen.This
onewas sex on a stick.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.990
No, no, I didn't thinkshe
was that attractive.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.190
I thought she was moreof
an eyesore, really.

11:13.200 --> 11:17.690
Are you kidding --the way she hugged
you?It almost triggeredmy angina.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.190
Well-played, pop.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.790
Come again soon...please.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.890
What's an angina?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.090
Do I have one of those?

11:25.400 --> 11:27.490
No, sweetie.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.490
Do you want to come to the
zoowith us tomorrow, grandpa?

11:30.500 --> 11:35.690
Would that I could,my love, but I have to
go downto san diego to see an old friend.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.690
Do you want to comewith us, dad?

11:37.700 --> 11:41.090
I'm sorry, baby.I've
got to work.I can'T.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.990
That's why you're here?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.090
Come on, don't besuch a
whiny little bitch, hank.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.390
Once again, my apologies.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.690
He is sometimes --a
whiny little bitch.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.090
- Hey!
- Rebecca, that's not funny.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.190
That's really not funny.

11:56.700 --> 11:59.090
That little fuzz comingfrom
your bottom lip --

11:59.100 --> 12:01.790
are you gonna bea trumpet
player or something?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.190
Yeah, I'm gonna bea trumpet player.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.290
Breathe.Count to ten.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.290
It just pisses me off.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.490
Becca actually wants
tospend time with the guy,

12:15.500 --> 12:18.890
and he's got to go run
offand visit some old cooze

12:18.900 --> 12:21.790
he was banging on the
side30 years ago.What?

12:23.100 --> 12:24.590
Why do you even careanymore?

12:24.600 --> 12:29.290
Because that's exactlythe type of shit that
put my motherinto an early grave, that's why.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.790
Hank, he's old man.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.090
Give the guy a break.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.590
Whatever wrongs he's
committed,just put them to one side.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.290
You're not gonnachange it now.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.790
Anyway, the guy probably
hasthree erections left.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.190
You should let himenjoy them.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.990
That fucker is the
horniest manI have ever met.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.690
He'll be pitching a tenton his deathbed.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.690
I don't know why you're sopissed at him
for not spending timewith his family.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.490
You never do.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.490
Do not -- do notturn
this around on me.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.790
Hank, I know you're busy.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.790
It comes with the territory.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.190
But I have not hada conversation
with you for like three months.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.990
You just don't give a shitanymore.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.890
Your head so farup your own
ass, and you don't even know it.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.790
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.890
I think you're right.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.890
You're only saying that'cause
you feel sorry for me.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.690
no***

13:24.500 --> 13:26.890
Okay, here's the plan.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.590
As soon as I finishthe movie, we pack
up the carand go back to new york city.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.990
Hank, how can you beso self-absorbed?

13:35.000 --> 13:35.890
What?

13:35.900 --> 13:37.790
We came here for you, right?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.290
I had nothing here.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.690
And now that I've startedto make things
work for me and I'm earning a living,

13:42.700 --> 13:44.790
it just means nothing to you.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.290
You're redesigning housesfor assholes.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.890
How is that any different from
redesigning scriptsfor assholes?

13:49.900 --> 13:54.790
It's not.That's my point.We got to get out
of here beforethe city destroys us both.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.890
You know,it's really not the city.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.390
Come on, tiny dancer.Is
that the best you got?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.890
Oh, not the face.He's too cute.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.590
Thank --
ohh.Fuck!

14:11.600 --> 14:13.890
Your pimp hand is strong.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.290
Well-played, son.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.790
That's not funny.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.890
You okay?

14:20.900 --> 14:23.090
All right, what arewe
talking about here?

14:23.100 --> 14:25.290
You make me an offer, I
willcounter the shit out of it.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.890
We will handle this like the
proud, beautifulblack men we are.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.990
I need somethingfor the valet.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.490
Both our pimps are here.Mine
gets 10%.What does yours get?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.090
10% of what exactly?

14:38.100 --> 14:39.590
See you later, sweetie.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.690
Bye.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.790
A veterinarian.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.690
Huh?What?

14:46.700 --> 14:49.990
I always wanted to bea
veterinarian when I grew up.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.690
You know,it's never too late.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.790
Good night.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.890
Okay, big boy.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.190
Here we go.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.290
You just cry it out.It hurts.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.790
I know it hurts.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.690
No, you're fucking hurting me.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.590
- I'm sorry.
- You're hurting my ears.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.690
Why are you crying?

15:14.700 --> 15:15.790
I'm sorry about your old man.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.990
He was a good guy.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.790
He was not.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.390
He used to sayyou looked
like a walking penis.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.690
Well, that's not very nice.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.590
It's not.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.390
All right, come on.We
got to get you on a plane.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.190
Fuck that.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.490
No, fuck you.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.390
You're goingon a plane to jfk tonight.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.990
You're gonna bewith your sisters.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.290
You deal with this
shit.You don't run from it.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.290
Don't tell me what to feel.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.190
All my fucking life, people have
been telling meI do things wrong.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.890
I'm alwaysthe fucking asshole.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.790
And I look around and I seeeverybody else
is infinitely more fucked upthan I am.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.090
I don't know those people.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.390
It could be the blow.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.090
yum

16:01.100 --> 16:06.090
Married or not, that's a hell
of a familyyou got there, kiddo.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.590
I like to think so.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.490
Can I give youa bit of advice?

16:09.500 --> 16:11.190
Do I have a choice?

16:11.200 --> 16:14.890
I know things are
crazyfor you right now --

16:14.900 --> 16:16.890
I've been there,in my own way.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.490
Just don't go so far that
youcannot find your way back.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.690
That's all I'm saying.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.590
Keep 'em close.Family comes first.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.490
That borders on hysterical,coming
from you and all.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.590
What, I was so bad?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.790
Your mother and I were
togethertill the bitter end.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.190
Bitter, it was.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.590
I can't believeyou're gonna sit there and
pretend to be all nobleabout this shit.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.790
If you've got somethingon
your mind, out with it.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.490
You were alwaysfucking someone else.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.490
Your mother and ihad a lot of problems.

16:44.500 --> 16:48.590
We were married young, and we
were not compatiblein that way.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.090
You know what I mean?

16:50.100 --> 16:52.790
I think I do,and I'd like somebody to

16:52.800 --> 16:55.790
fuckin' smack meover the head
with a shovel right now --anyone.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.390
I'm not proudof some of the things I
do, but if I had to do itall over again,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.390
I'm not sure I would
go at itany differently.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.790
Why do you say that?

17:02.800 --> 17:05.190
Because there's not a womanthat
I've crossed paths with

17:05.200 --> 17:07.589
that I haven'tfallen in love with,

17:07.599 --> 17:10.190
whether it wasfor 10
minutes or 10 years.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.890
What would have been better
--a lifetime of denying that?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.890
Your mother was into all
thatcatholic guilt shit, not me.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.589
Life's too shortto
dance with fat chicks.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.390
Let me get
this straight --

17:20.400 --> 17:24.190
the lesson here iskeep the family
together and fuck around on the side

17:24.200 --> 17:26.690
if your wife doesn't
want toblow you anymore.

17:26.700 --> 17:27.490
You watch it.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.090
I'm not so old that I won't
kickthe shit out of you.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.890
I rememberthat shit, too.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.190
So now I beat you?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.990
You know what the problemwith
your generation is?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.790
You think raising a handto a
kid is the same as child abuse.

17:37.800 --> 17:42.190
I don't have itright in front of me, but
I think that'sthe textbook definition.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.590
Always the smartass.

17:43.600 --> 17:47.290
Hey, it's your life -- yours
to screw upif you want to.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.790
I was here a year ago.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.890
You were much happierthen...

17:54.900 --> 17:58.090
and even happierthe year before that.

17:58.900 --> 18:02.990
You're not goingin the right direction.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.990
I swearto fucking god, karen, I
am not sleepingwith anyone else.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.590
Well, you're certainlynot
sleeping with me.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.390
How is that my fault?

18:39.400 --> 18:43.390
Every time I geteven remotely close
to you, you run halfwayacross the room.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.190
No, I don'T.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.490
Anyway,that didn't used to stop you.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.790
You know whatthe weirdest thing is?

18:47.800 --> 18:49.490
I actually wishyou were having an affair

18:49.500 --> 18:52.290
because then I would
stoplooking for clues everywhere.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.190
I would never do thatto you.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.590
You say that.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.290
That's just 'cause that'syour
fucking romantic ideal,

18:59.300 --> 19:01.090
but the truth is,you think about it.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.090
Yes, I think about it.Who doesn't?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.990
I never did.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.590
Never did?

19:08.500 --> 19:10.090
Past tense --that's
a little unsettling.

19:10.100 --> 19:14.990
Hank, you should tryand live with someone
how fucking lucky you areto be with them!

19:15.000 --> 19:16.990
God damn it,that is not how I feel.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.790
That is how you act.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.390
Well, fuck, karen.It's life, then.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.990
I guess it's hard sometimes.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.290
You're gonnahave to deal with it.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.290
I am tryingto deal with it!

19:26.300 --> 19:28.690
That's why I'm havingthis
conversation with you.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.990
Hank, we needto go see someone.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.590
I am not goingto a fucking
shrink!I'm a writer!

19:33.600 --> 19:35.590
I don't give that shit away.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.690
We're better than that.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.690
We're better than that?

19:37.700 --> 19:41.590
Because it feels to me likewe're
fucking dying here, hank.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.890
We are not talking.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.290
We are not fucking.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.190
Nothing is happening.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.890
And?

19:47.900 --> 19:52.090
And I find myself wantingto
talk to other people.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.090
Like bill?

19:55.100 --> 19:56.590
You fucking talkingto bill?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.890
The jolly green giant?

19:59.300 --> 20:01.190
I'm kidding, karen.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.790
I don't even want to godown that road.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.190
Have you fucked him?

20:07.700 --> 20:09.890
It's so fucking typical.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.690
You go straightto the fucking.

20:11.700 --> 20:14.490
You don't even careif I'm talking
to him, if I'm telling him things --

20:14.500 --> 20:16.990
just answerthe fucking question!

20:18.000 --> 20:20.990
You didn't answer me.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.090
Yes, I did.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.290
You know me.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.290
The talking and the
fuckinggo hand in hand, hank.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.990
I got to get the fuckout of here.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.890
No, no.You know what?

20:37.900 --> 20:39.990
- Allow me to do
-- - come here.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.090
No.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.490
Hank, this isn'tgonna
work.It's not gonna --

20:49.500 --> 20:51.690
- stop!
- Let me go!

21:01.000 --> 21:02.490
Is it safe?

21:02.500 --> 21:05.090
I don't know, honey.You
might want to graba helmet.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.290
There could be some
shrapnelflying around.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.590
Are you guysgoing to get a divorce?

21:09.600 --> 21:12.990
I think that's the good
thingabout never being married --

21:13.000 --> 21:15.690
it's impossibleto get a divorce.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.790
You know what I mean.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.490
I-I-I know what you mean,and
I'm doing the best I can.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.690
hank honey

21:45.000 --> 21:46.890
ac ****

22:31.500 --> 22:34.090
- Hank.
- Yeah.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.490
"To my son, the writer.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.990
"Something I never
saidtoo much -- I love you.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.190
"My fathernever said it much, either.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.190
And I thought I'd be
different,but I guess I'm not.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.390
"I tried, but somewherealong the line,

23:11.400 --> 23:14.790
"you slip backinto what you
know, "and I'm sorry about that.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.590
"And I'm sorry we haven't talkedin
a while because I miss you.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.490
"You're a good kidand a funny kid.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.190
"And you're my only son.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.390
"I said I never read
your books,but I lied.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.890
"I read 'em all.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.190
