00:02.836 --> 00:04.472
Hello, keen viewers.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.407
My name is Walter O'Brien,
and you are watching

00:06.440 --> 00:09.310
the seminal episode
of Walt's Whiz Kidz.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.113
Now, today, we will be
learning the most basic

00:12.146 --> 00:14.715
concepts of physics:
acceleration, deceleration,

00:14.748 --> 00:16.450
velocity, gravity,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.786
Newton's laws of motion,
thermodynamics, impact force...

00:18.819 --> 00:22.723
What kid besides Ralph is
gonna understand all that?

00:22.756 --> 00:26.060
Now we will be doing this via
the classic egg drop experiment.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.696
I have already explained
the aforementioned concepts

00:28.729 --> 00:32.333
to our Whiz Kidz, who are going
to use homemade contraptions

00:32.366 --> 00:35.669
to protect their eggs
from a 12-foot drop.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.538
Ready, Whiz Kidz?

00:37.571 --> 00:38.772
ALL:
Ready!

00:38.806 --> 00:39.673
Okay!
Ready!

00:39.707 --> 00:41.775
Okay, let them drop!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.447
Okay, cut, cut, cut.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.815
Why is Ralph the only one
getting this?

00:47.848 --> 00:50.818
I told you, it's so simple.
You increase

00:50.851 --> 00:52.486
the egg's drag
to generate friction,

00:52.520 --> 00:54.755
turning its kinetic energy
into heat

00:54.788 --> 00:56.790
to combat gravity,
reducing its

00:56.824 --> 00:59.227
acceleration over the longest
period of time possible

00:59.260 --> 01:02.163
to reduce the impact
when it hits the ground, okay?

01:02.196 --> 01:05.099
Okay, let's try again.
Take six.

01:08.869 --> 01:12.173
Wayne, did you just
write "gravity"

01:12.206 --> 01:14.142
on your egg and drop it?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.376
Huh?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.845
Everyone just calls
him "Meatball."

01:19.880 --> 01:23.251
You sure you want Walt hosting
your public access science show?

01:23.284 --> 01:25.619
Well, I got the funding for it.
I can't be the face of it, too.

01:25.653 --> 01:26.854
Conflict of interest.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.657
Yeah, good luck.
I got to go.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.260
I got to pick up Allie
for a little R, R and R.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.561
What's the extra "R" for?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.596
Romance.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.768
Here you go, mister.
Oh, Meatball!

01:40.801 --> 01:42.570
Haven't you ever heard
of salmonella?!

01:42.603 --> 01:44.438
Patty, what are you doing?

01:44.472 --> 01:46.774
Taking PR pictures
for your reelection campaign.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.876
Reelection?
I just had an election.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.811
That was a year ago,
and it's a two-year term.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.280
Time to start pounding
the pavement.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.183
Already lined up an
endorsement meeting

01:55.216 --> 01:56.417
with the powerful
library committee,

01:56.450 --> 01:58.586
a photo op at the
Warlock's Chest, and

01:58.619 --> 02:00.921
an interview with my old friends
at the West Altadenia Shopper.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.923
If I spend all my time
campaigning, I won't be able

02:02.956 --> 02:04.592
to advance
my anti-bullying platform,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.495
or get funding
for my piezoelectric walkway.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.797
You're finally starting
to get politics.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.367
My schedule is so full up with
aldermanning and Scorpion,

02:13.401 --> 02:16.204
I don't know
if I want to run for reelection.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.805
Who cares what you want?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
You've cut the town's
electric usage

02:19.873 --> 02:21.375
by redesigning street lamps.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.810
You lowered pollution
and commute time

02:22.843 --> 02:24.445
by synchronizing
traffic lights,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.514
and now you're producing
a science show for kids.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.216
You're effective.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.783
And I want
to graduate with honors,

02:29.817 --> 02:32.653
and getting a nobody
elected twice guarantees it.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.356
Here's some more.
Oh!

02:35.389 --> 02:37.758
Seriously?!

02:37.791 --> 02:39.260
(throat clearing)

02:39.293 --> 02:41.695
Thank you for your time today.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.232
Um, my latest chemical endeavor

02:44.265 --> 02:46.934
harnesses the power
of the invisible

02:46.967 --> 02:50.938
light spectrum
by creating a translucent,

02:50.971 --> 02:53.441
luminescent solar concentrator

02:53.474 --> 02:55.876
that is capable of
converting infrared light

02:55.909 --> 02:58.346
into an electrical current...

02:58.379 --> 03:00.381
Stop. Just stop. Investors

03:00.414 --> 03:02.983
are not interested in the
science behind your invention.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.553
But then, how will they know
what they're investing in?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.721
They're either investing
in a winner or loser,

03:07.755 --> 03:09.257
so just show them
how they make money.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.991
If you can't explain it
to them in one sentence,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.261
then they'll know which
of the two they're investing in.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.363
Okay.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.964
Then, with your investment,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.866
I can make translucent
solar panels

03:18.899 --> 03:21.469
to replace everyday windows
and cut energy bills.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.671
There. Wasn't so hard, was it?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.708
Okay. Thank you for your help.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.010
Not a problem.
Good luck.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.845
Oh, if you're looking

03:31.879 --> 03:33.180
for more eggs, we're out.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.450
Yes, that's 'cause Ralph is the
only Whiz Kid that I have here.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.519
The rest are useless!

03:38.552 --> 03:40.020
That means
they're just regular kids.

03:40.053 --> 03:40.921
Be patient.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.991
You mean, like you
were with Florence?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.827
I heard you giving her notes
on her investor's speech.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.296
A little harsh.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.964
I was being direct...
to help her.

03:50.998 --> 03:54.268
You sure it doesn't
have anything to do

03:54.302 --> 03:57.971
with, um... us
kissing in my dream?

03:58.005 --> 04:00.741
(laughs)
Wow, what an ego.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.943
For the last time,
I am fine with your dream.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.712
It all happened
when you were dying,

04:04.745 --> 04:06.980
and Toby told me
it wasn't a big deal,

04:07.014 --> 04:08.982
so it'd be illogical for me

04:09.016 --> 04:11.985
to feel anything
but okay, right?

04:12.019 --> 04:16.324
Good. Well, in that case,
uh, can I ask you a favor?

04:16.357 --> 04:18.326
Mm-hmm.
I need eggs.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.493
(eggs splattering)

04:19.527 --> 04:20.961
MEATBALL:
That's the last of them!

04:20.994 --> 04:22.696
Lots of them.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.546
Not bad.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.681
Not bad at all, Gallo.

04:40.714 --> 04:45.018
You ready for a weekend of
no work, no cases, no Scorpion?

04:45.052 --> 04:48.989
Sounds like a plan.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.991
(thud)

04:51.024 --> 04:53.594
I thought we had the place
to ourselves.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.363
So did I.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.731
Then what? A... a prowler?

04:57.765 --> 05:00.000
(quietly):
Wait here.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.890
CABE: Don't
move, scumbag.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.458
Toby?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.693
Cabe, what are you doing here?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.461
I'm on vacation.
What are you doing?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.897
You got to get out of here. Ju--
g-get the hell out of here, man.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.532
Okay, perv, I put it on...

05:34.034 --> 05:35.803
Weekend ruined.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.637
No, no, no! No, no, no!

05:36.670 --> 05:38.672
Don't take it off!

05:39.873 --> 05:41.742
Congratulations, Cabe.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.677
You got her out of that outfit
faster than I ever could've.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.413
What are you doing
in my lighthouse?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.381
Your lighthouse? We booked this.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.550
I've been talking about bringing
Allie to this place for weeks.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.519
No duh. It sounded so good,
we booked it, too.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.453
Not for this weekend,
you didn't.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.887
It says right here

05:53.921 --> 05:58.892
that it's our lighthouse today,
the 22nd.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.794
Well, I got confirmation...

06:00.828 --> 06:01.995
Crap.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.163
The 27th.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.297
Happens to the best of us.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.800
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.836
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, wait.
Can we-we trade the dates?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.571
This weekend's
kind of important.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.005
More important than two geniuses
populating the Earth

06:12.039 --> 06:13.140
with a superbaby?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.608
(sighs)
Just hear him out.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.843
The mood's already killed.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.445
Are you proud of yourself, Cabe?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.646
She's in normal clothes now.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.780
Normal clothes.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.652
I didn't mean to bust up
your Cleopatra/pirate story,

06:24.685 --> 06:26.820
but now that it's over,
can you do me a solid?

06:26.854 --> 06:30.558
I was really planning on telling
Allie that I'm in love with her.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.962
You haven't told her already?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.164
Assumed you had. You've been
going out for months.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.466
I'm old-fashioned.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.733
You're old everything.

06:41.201 --> 06:45.005
The only gal I've ever said
those words to is my ex-wife.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.841
I never thought I'd say them
to another woman again,

06:47.875 --> 06:50.711
but since I almost went
to the slammer,

06:50.744 --> 06:52.913
I'm not gonna hold back anymore.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.988
You are lucky that my old lady
has a soft spot for you.

07:01.021 --> 07:05.526
We'll, uh, just take our
procreation weekend on the road.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.194
Okay, good. I owe you one.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.463
(quietly):
You know, actually,

07:09.497 --> 07:12.466
maybe you could lend us
one of your old FBI jackets.

07:12.500 --> 07:16.003
For, um, reasons.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.039
(electricity buzzing)

07:26.880 --> 07:31.552
I get Patty's position, but
being an alderman is exhausting.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.121
I mean, I-I haven't played
Fantasies & Frolics in weeks.

07:34.154 --> 07:38.158
But I have things that I want
to accomplish. Dreams.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.893
Seems everyone has dreams.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.664
Some about their futures,
some about their neighbors.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.567
I thought you were okay
with Walt's dream.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.502
Toby said it was meaningless.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.938
What the hell?

07:54.207 --> 07:56.610
WALTER: Let's go.
We need to move faster, people.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.245
Ralph's done already.
RALPH:
Nice camera.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.681
Huge improvement
over Johann Zahn's.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.583
Huh? What?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.117
Johann Zahn.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.919
Inventor of the camera.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.856
What about him?
I was cropping pictures.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.124
Nothing.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
Okay.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.863
You almost finished
retrofitting your contraptions?

08:15.896 --> 08:18.899
(screams)

08:18.932 --> 08:20.200
I didn't do it.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.334
It's a power surge.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.771
Here, stay away from anything
plugged in. S-Stay put.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.873
What's going on?
WALTER: Our
cell network

08:25.906 --> 08:27.708
and Internet are down.

08:27.741 --> 08:28.776
Let's see.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.112
Anyone on?

08:32.145 --> 08:35.215
You got me, Toby,
Cabe and Allie.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.784
PAIGE:
And you've got Paige and Sly.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.719
What-what are we dealing with?

08:38.752 --> 08:40.087
For starters,
Cabe ruined our weekend.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.890
Shut up. There was a flash,
now there's no power,

08:42.923 --> 08:44.858
and there's not a light
source on the coast.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.894
Whole sky's glowing green.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.095
Is it some kind of attack?

08:48.128 --> 08:51.632
No. The aurora that you're
seeing is the northern lights.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.900
The fact that you're seeing it
in Southern California

08:52.933 --> 08:54.902
is a sign that we've been hit

08:54.935 --> 08:56.003
by a solar storm.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.070
A what?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.773
Sometimes there is
a plasma eruption on the sun.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.842
Now, plasma contains
charged particles

09:01.875 --> 09:02.976
that, when it hits Earth,

09:03.010 --> 09:05.946
causes numerous issues
due to radiation

09:05.979 --> 09:07.881
and geomagnetic-induced current.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.182
This knocks out the power grid

09:09.216 --> 09:12.152
and satellites,
GPS and cell towers.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.021
Almost everything that was
plugged in when this hit

09:14.054 --> 09:14.888
is fried beyond repair.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.224
Last time this
happened was in 1989,

09:17.257 --> 09:19.960
when a grid in Quebec was
knocked out for over six hours.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.895
And that's nothing compared to
the worst solar storm on record,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.330
the 1859 Carrington Event.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.800
Grid was hit so hard that
all communication went offline.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.936
And back then, it was
just telegraphs. But now?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.671
We could be looking at a power
and communication blackout

09:30.704 --> 09:32.806
that could last several years.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.774
PAIGE:
So how do we find out the extent

09:33.807 --> 09:35.008
of this solar storm if we can't

09:35.042 --> 09:36.276
call anyone or look up the news?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.145
We could use a ham radio.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.914
Uh, solar radiation knocks out
higher frequencies,

09:40.948 --> 09:42.850
but we can still reach people
on lower frequencies--

09:42.883 --> 09:44.752
the same reason why our comms
are still working.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.054
Mm. Unfortunately,
I left my ham radio

09:47.087 --> 09:48.355
and my Dick Tracy
decoder ring

09:48.388 --> 09:49.990
back at my apartment.
Well, I have one,

09:50.023 --> 09:53.894
in the garage, under the ramp,
in my solar storm go-bag,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.128
next to my earthquake go-bag

09:55.162 --> 09:57.197
and my financial collapse
go-bag.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.032
I'll get it.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.802
Sly, hey. Remember our talk
about the difference

10:01.835 --> 10:03.403
between obsession
and preparation?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.872
Guess which way
you're leaning, buddy.

10:04.905 --> 10:05.939
Do you want a ham radio or not?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.209
Here you go.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.044
I'm scared.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.946
I want my parents.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.715
That's not possible, Melanie.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.917
Traffic lights are out all over,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.151
and there's gridlock
and mass confusion.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.386
Oh, comics!
So there's a good chance

10:19.419 --> 10:21.221
that you won't see
your parents for days.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.656
Dude.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.091
Walter, she's ten.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.293
So she should understand
the concept of traffic. Ah, ha.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.862
Here we are. Ham radio.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.398
Now I just need to find
a monitored frequency.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.001
CABE:
Try 146.52.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.069
That's a Homeland
emergency channel.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.705
Hello? Anyone there?

10:37.738 --> 10:40.073
Sir, this is
a government channel.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.408
I need you to leave it
immediately.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.076
CABE: Just give them
my badge number.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.012
Homeland badge number 2-8-3-5.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.313
Hold for verification.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.048
Agent Gallo, how can we help?

10:48.081 --> 10:50.283
Uh, this is actually
Walter O'Brien of Scorpion

10:50.317 --> 10:52.119
working with Agent Gallo.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.421
Now, he would like an update and
advice as to how we can assist.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.989
We're still gathering intel.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.157
All of this is preliminary data,

10:57.190 --> 11:00.427
but most of the power grid
and comms are down in SoCal.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.963
Emergency services have
mobilized to get power back up

11:02.996 --> 11:05.999
to the most vulnerable:
hospitals and retirement homes,

11:06.033 --> 11:08.401
but if you want to assist,
we have an aircraft issue.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.038
Well, major airlines
have backup systems

11:11.071 --> 11:13.140
to maintain GPS
and communications,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.108
so I'm assuming a private plane?

11:15.142 --> 11:18.278
Correct. There were 25 smaller
craft in the process of landing

11:18.311 --> 11:19.713
when the solar flare struck.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.414
But we are missing one seaplane

11:21.448 --> 11:23.183
that took off from
San Francisco at 5:30

11:23.216 --> 11:23.984
with a flight
plan for L.A.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.153
The pilot is not
instrument rated.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.021
(whispering): That means
he can't fly at night.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.189
We believe his comms
and navigation

11:29.222 --> 11:31.792
are down, which means
he's flying blind.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.894
We are putting out
a million fires here at once.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.363
Can you and Agent Gallo
handle this one?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.264
Absolutely.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.133
Uh, uh, Walt, hey.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.202
We can hear the ham radio
over the comms.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.303
Why would you agree to that?

11:43.336 --> 11:44.437
It's an impossible task.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.310
Because if we don't help,
who will?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.780
Great, so all we have to do
is find a tiny seaplane

11:52.813 --> 11:54.181
in the middle
of a pitch-black sky.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.816
That's flying somewhere

11:55.849 --> 11:56.950
between San Fran and L.A.

11:56.984 --> 11:57.851
With no working instruments.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.053
Before it crashes
or runs out of fuel.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.991
But if we do our part, whoever's
on the stick, they'll do theirs.

12:04.024 --> 12:07.761
Those flyboys have nerves
of steel.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.230
Mayday, Mayday,
come in! Mayday!

12:10.263 --> 12:12.199
I can't get in
touch with anyone.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.134
No one can help us.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.471
?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.518
So, what's the plan?

12:31.551 --> 12:34.287
Okay, we have three tasks.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.790
One: find the plane; two:
make contact with the pilot,

12:36.824 --> 12:38.859
and three: guide him to safety.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.160
Uh, how do we
find the plane?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.895
The sky's a
pretty big place.

12:41.929 --> 12:45.165
Okay, we know the plane
took off at 5:30

12:45.198 --> 12:46.800
and FAA regulations require

12:46.834 --> 12:48.869
pilots to stay at
their altitude

12:48.902 --> 12:51.939
and en route if they
lose communication.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.074
Sly, that should be enough to do
some quick math with that data.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.209
Theoretically, but I can't
approximate the plane's locale

12:56.243 --> 12:58.979
without its max speed,
its fuel and its weight,

12:59.012 --> 13:00.580
stuff I normally grab
off the Internet.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.315
But since the cell
service is down,

13:02.349 --> 13:03.516
I don't think I can do that.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.518
You need plane
data? Get in.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.956
There's an aviation school
nearby that has info

13:08.989 --> 13:10.323
on every aircraft,
standard flight patterns...

13:10.357 --> 13:11.925
Ralph had a field trip there.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.293
How many trips
does that kid go on?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.828
Too many.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.363
Great thinking, Paige.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.998
Now, Happy, Toby, you'll need
to figure out a way

13:18.031 --> 13:19.332
to get the lighthouse
up and running.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.367
A small seaplane

13:20.400 --> 13:21.869
will be flying close to shore.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.270
Yeah, if we
light this candle

13:23.303 --> 13:25.338
it'll be the brightest
object on a dark coastline.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.407
It'll be a beacon
for the seaplane.
Yeah, but we're out of power.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.978
I may be able to get this
old dame up and running.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.380
And I will find a way to
communicate with the pilot.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.447
Once I'm done, I'll head
to the lighthouse.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.084
You're not going anywhere.
You're the only adult

13:37.117 --> 13:38.418
in a garage full
of scared children.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.020
You need to watch them.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.289
Oh, yeah, the ch-children.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.459
Patty.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.928
You're, uh, 18, 19?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.329
Um, I'm 16.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.998
Good enough. You're in charge.
Uh, Ralph.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.100
Yes. Whatever you
need, I can help.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.401
No, just listen to Patty.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.568
She's in charge of the kids.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.906
Okay, who likes arts and crafts?
I do.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.074
Come on, Ralph, we're
gonna use pipe cleaners.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.546
When they shut this place down,
they kept the components intact.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.381
We get it power,
we get the light back on.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.649
Shouldn't there be a generator?

14:09.682 --> 14:10.884
HAPPY: Ah, looks
like they removed it

14:10.918 --> 14:13.921
during the renovation, but I got
a way to juice this sucker:

14:13.954 --> 14:15.188
Cabe's SUV.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.289
CABE: Cars run on
direct current.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.026
All this stuff is running
on alternating current.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.427
They're not compatible.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.096
I saw a brand-new fridge
in the kitchen.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.965
It's got an inverter
to save energy.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.433
I can extract it,

14:26.466 --> 14:29.169
run it with the jumper
cables from Cabe's SUV

14:29.202 --> 14:31.972
to the main power line for the
lighthouse and turn DC into AC.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.174
Hmm, well, then we'll
no longer be "Back in Black."

14:34.207 --> 14:35.108
Huh?

14:35.142 --> 14:36.576
You get it? DC/AC, AC/DC.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.477
That's the title
of their hit song.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.913
Just get the jumper cables.
Yes, dear.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.082
Do you know what you're doing?

14:42.115 --> 14:43.450
I've seen Happy do it
a million times

14:43.483 --> 14:45.052
with a lock just like this.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.487
You press the flathead
against the tumbler,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.222
give it a firm pop
with the palm of your hand.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.062
Is that how it works for Happy?

14:55.095 --> 14:57.464
Come on.
We'll send them a check.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.366
Oh.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.201
Wow, Happy makes
that look so easy.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.471
Done, guys.
It's a pigeon.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.672
With four legs.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.074
Yeah.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.541
Great job.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.483
Walter, you got to
give me something to do.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.686
Ah, okay. Hold the circuit board
steady while I solder this.

15:19.719 --> 15:23.723
No, I mean something to
really help with the case.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.658
Patty has me playing art class
with Meatball.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.496
I need her to see me as a man.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.663
But you're not a man.
You're 13.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.266
Please. I'm dying over there.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.236
(clucks tongue) All right.
You can help me with the launch.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.504
What launch?

15:37.537 --> 15:41.174
Okay, give me the speaker.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.609
Great.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.744
Now, you see, Whiz Kids,
what I did was match

15:44.777 --> 15:47.414
the frequency of an
ordinary radio speaker

15:47.447 --> 15:51.184
to the frequency of our comms,
which makes me and my team...

15:52.285 --> 15:53.720
...what?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.355
Magic.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.157
No, not magic.
In communication

15:57.190 --> 16:00.660
with our friend,
Birdroni, here.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.500
Hey, Ralph. You
should handle this.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.503
I have programmed the lighthouse
coordinates into the remote.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.506
You might want to take
a step back for safety.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.016
Aah!
What the hell?!

16:23.050 --> 16:26.553
Sorry. Uh, I had
the remote upside down.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.158
Yeah, I'll just take that.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.365
Inverter's attached.
Got it.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.766
You ready?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.368
Pipe's open. Do your thing.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.506
Okay, babe, hit it.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.108
ALLIE:
It worked.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.576
TOBY:
One beacon up and running.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.479
Now if we only knew where
to look for that seaplane.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.646
SYLVESTER:
Try between longitude 33.724

16:53.680 --> 16:57.650
and .725 and
latitude -118.211

16:57.684 --> 17:00.720
and .218.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.156
Focus the lens of the lighthouse
in that direction

17:03.190 --> 17:04.291
to attract the seaplane.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.394
HAPPY:
It's working.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.137
What? We've already committed
breaking and entering.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.339
I don't want to add vandalism
to my rap sheet.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.242
Oh, smashing a glass door
isn't considered vandalism?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.410
That was an accident

17:23.443 --> 17:25.278
and vandalism is
an intentional crime.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.713
Stop lawyering me and
figure out how much fuel

17:26.746 --> 17:28.615
that plane has left if
it was full on takeoff.
Okay.

17:31.818 --> 17:36.423
We're getting low on fuel.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.259
Rachel, I am so sorry
I got us into this.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.293
No, it's not your fault.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.162
No, it is. I convinced
you to come up with me.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.163
I-I talked you into it.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.264
Look, there!

17:44.297 --> 17:45.132
Is that a light?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.166
W-Where?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.367
Over there. Is that land?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.202
Uh, one way
to find out.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.207
Anything?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.675
Not yet.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.377
Happy and Toby have
been talking to Walt.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.279
He sent Birdroni
towards the lighthouse.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.214
He rigged it with
speakers and cameras.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.584
If the plane heads towards us
and sees our light,

18:04.617 --> 18:06.253
he can land the drone
onto their window

18:06.286 --> 18:08.421
and establish communication.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.390
Ambitious plan.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.724
Guess we can only wait.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.727
Yeah.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.863
Hey, why don't I take over
for a little while?

18:18.898 --> 18:21.301
Okay.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.536
You ever work
binoculars before?

18:23.570 --> 18:25.572
How do you think
I found you?

18:30.477 --> 18:33.280
You know, uh...

18:33.313 --> 18:35.315
while we're
waiting, I, uh,

18:35.348 --> 18:37.317
there was something I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.719
ALLIE:
Sure.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.922
I, um...

18:42.955 --> 18:45.558
ALLIE:
Cabe! I think I see it.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.560
CABE:
Hey, Walt.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.429
We've got a visual
on the seaplane.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.331
Fantastic. Give
me the specs.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.832
It's coming in
from my one o'clock.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.402
It's about 50
klicks away.
Okay, speed?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.604
Can't get a read on that.
Hey, I'm starving.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.507
The altitude couldn't
be more than 500 feet.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.674
Looks like he's heading
straight for the lighthouse.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.510
These are burned.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.712
You hear Cabe?
Yeah, I've got my comm in

19:05.745 --> 19:07.380
and I've adjusted Birdroni.
Okay, give me the remote.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.948
(whispering): Come on,
you said I'd get another chance

19:08.981 --> 19:09.849
to impress Patty.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.651
Yeah, no, you did.
You got us this far,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.353
but I need to land Birdroni
on the plane

19:13.386 --> 19:14.654
and I can't leave that
to someone

19:14.687 --> 19:15.822
who gets so nervous
around a girl

19:15.855 --> 19:17.490
that he holds the remote
upside down.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.359
Come on.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.159
Thank you.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.262
Okay, changing
Birdroni's course.

19:22.295 --> 19:26.266
Arriving at the edge
of Sly's search grid now.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.600
There it is. It's following
the light to the lighthouse.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.569
WALTER: Uh-huh. Sending
Birdroni in to land.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.839
That's amazing
piloting, Walter.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.908
Yeah, Walt. Great job.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.811
What the hell is that?

19:38.845 --> 19:39.979
I-In the moonlight.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.314
It's a bird?

19:41.348 --> 19:43.650
It's... it's a drone.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.260
Hello. My name is Walter O'Brien
and I'm here to help you land.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.895
Uh... good,

19:55.928 --> 19:59.966
because I've lost most
communication and navigation.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.302
I-I've got pilot controls,
but that's it.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.970
Well, that's due
to a coronal mass ejection,

20:04.003 --> 20:04.971
which sent protons...

20:05.004 --> 20:06.706
Walter, simplify.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.275
There's more
than one of you?

20:08.308 --> 20:11.344
We are a team.
A natural disaster hit.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.879
It damaged your plane.
We're here to help.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.948
Um, tiny problem.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.351
I don't really
have experience

20:18.385 --> 20:20.287
flying at night.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.722
Uh, I don't think I can land
without my guidance system.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.791
I thought you flew
all the time, Griffin.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.460
Well, with my dad who doesn't
know I borrowed his plane.

20:27.494 --> 20:31.431
Look, I just wanted to take
you to L.A. for the weekend.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.933
Hey, kid, weekend plans get
messed up all the time.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.935
The main thing is we're trying
to get you home in one piece.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.505
Now, I got a pilot here who can
talk you through the landing.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.440
Okay, Griffin, we're gonna get
you to land on the water

20:40.473 --> 20:42.642
right by the lighthouse
that you're headed to.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.812
GRIFFIN:
Um, one more thing.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.314
I've only landed solo
a half dozen times

20:47.347 --> 20:49.682
and always during the day.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.684
Okay, it's simple,
just like your training.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.754
Slow your descent,
keep the draft stabilized

20:54.787 --> 20:56.923
and pretend the light
on the water is your runway.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.459
U-Um, I'm kind of
freaking out a bit.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.528
I don't blame the kid.
I'd be terrified.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.829
We can hear you!

21:02.862 --> 21:04.331
TOBY:
Hey, Griffin.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.798
My name's Toby, I'm a doctor,

21:05.832 --> 21:07.066
and I'm gonna calm you down.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.369
I want you to breathe in
for four seconds,

21:09.402 --> 21:11.604
then hold it for seven
and exhale for five.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.906
You ready? Go.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.310
(all inhaling)

21:18.645 --> 21:19.812
What are you doing?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.348
(holding breath):
Relaxing.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.015
(exhaling)

21:27.554 --> 21:29.956
TOBY:
All right, Griffin,
we just activated

21:29.989 --> 21:32.925
your hypothalamus
to tell your pituitary gland

21:32.959 --> 21:35.362
to send out neurohormones
that'll inhibit

21:35.395 --> 21:36.729
stress-producing hormones

21:36.763 --> 21:39.499
and trigger a relaxation
response in your body.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.335
How you feeling now, buddy?

21:42.369 --> 21:43.736
Better.
Great.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.472
Now you just listen to
the beautiful voice

21:45.505 --> 21:47.440
of my beautiful bride

21:47.474 --> 21:49.542
and let your instincts
take over.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.912
HAPPY: Okay, kid, pull on the
throttle and adjust your draft.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.448
Walt, we're gonna need you
to keep an eye on the plane's

21:55.482 --> 21:58.851
altitude and speed
via Birdroni.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.887
Well, Griffin could be slower
and lower,

22:00.920 --> 22:01.954
but his flow is perfect.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.657
Oh, what a surprise,
Walter thinks Flo is perfect.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.627
That's just beneath you.

22:07.660 --> 22:12.131
Paige, I know bullies.

22:12.164 --> 22:16.068
And a bully is someone
who picks on somebody

22:16.102 --> 22:19.706
for no other reason
but their own insecurity.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.874
That's what you're doing
to Florence.

22:21.908 --> 22:25.445
You, Paige...
you're being a bully.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.683
Okay, I see the lighthouse.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.818
HAPPY:
Okay, good.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.586
Focus on the light
hitting the water.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.455
Got a visual.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.557
HAPPY: Okay, now reduce your
power, tilt your nose up

22:37.590 --> 22:38.858
and begin your descent.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.493
You got this?
We're gonna be okay?

22:40.527 --> 22:43.563
Yeah, visibility's great.
I got this.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.565
There you go.
Nice and easy.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.402
What the hell?!
(screams)

22:49.436 --> 22:51.170
Uh, okay, you've hit something.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.939
Pull up.
What happened?

22:52.972 --> 22:55.475
HAPPY:
You need to gain altitude.
You're gonna hit the bluff.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.744
Griffin, full throttle!
(both screaming)

22:57.777 --> 22:59.045
Pull up, pull up!

23:00.780 --> 23:03.550
Their float must have
hit some flotsam.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.417
Okay, binoculars.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.152
But is the plane okay?

23:06.185 --> 23:08.521
Can we take another
run at landing her?

23:10.657 --> 23:14.193
Uh, don't worry about it.
We'll get you down in a jiffy.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.928
Okay, their float is toast.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.565
Without it, there's no way
to land the plane.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.807
WALTER: Okay, Griffin,
stay in a holding pattern,

23:27.840 --> 23:29.108
we'll be with you in a second.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.644
We have an inexperienced pilot

23:31.678 --> 23:33.546
in a seaplane
with a missing float.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.147
And no navigational systems.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.883
And no pancakes.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.850
Seriously? Now?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.586
I'm growing.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.987
Oy.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.956
So a water landing is
no longer an option.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.859
SYLVESTER:
According to my calculations,
they're gonna run out of fuel

23:46.893 --> 23:48.661
in less than 30 minutes.

23:48.695 --> 23:49.896
So, ideas?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.498
How 'bout not
burning them this time?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.500
How 'bout you stop talking?

23:53.533 --> 23:54.801
Walter, don't talk
to a kid like that.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.135
CABE: Why don't we do
a plane-to-plane transfer?

23:56.168 --> 23:58.605
It's risky, but it's
been done before.

23:58.638 --> 23:59.706
What, scramble a jet
and pull it off

23:59.739 --> 24:01.608
with a couple of terrified kids
in the pitch black?

24:01.641 --> 24:02.975
There's not enough time
for that.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.077
Are all those people
gonna die?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.514
Probably. Ow!

24:07.547 --> 24:09.148
Uh, maybe.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.149
(thud)
Ow!

24:10.182 --> 24:11.851
You're supposed to use eggs.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.153
Well, you broke all the eggs.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.155
Oh...

24:16.188 --> 24:18.090
MEATBALL:
Hey, I'm still hungry.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.526
Guys, are you still there?

24:19.559 --> 24:21.127
Where else would we be?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.895
Well, can we take another
shot at landing the plane?

24:22.929 --> 24:24.664
Uh, not exactly.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.633
You lost a float
when you hit some debris,

24:26.666 --> 24:28.234
so a water landing now would

24:28.267 --> 24:29.869
flip the plane over,
killing you both.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.270
Oh, God!
But it's okay--

24:31.303 --> 24:33.072
you don't want to land,
you want to crash.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.708
Wh-- I'm gonna disagree
with you on that one.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.744
Okay, I think what
Walt is suggesting

24:37.777 --> 24:39.612
is a controlled crash.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.514
It's very common in
the aviation world.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.215
We will do everything to
make sure that you land

24:43.249 --> 24:44.083
as comfortably as possible.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.686
How are you gonna
make the ground comfy?

24:46.719 --> 24:48.220
It's just like
the egg drop experiment.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.188
We increase
the plane's drag...

24:49.221 --> 24:52.024
To create friction
between it and the air.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.193
Converting its kinetic energy
into heat...

24:54.226 --> 24:55.194
So it decelerates...

24:55.227 --> 24:58.064
And turns into gravity!

24:58.097 --> 24:59.599
No.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.933
What the hell does
that even mean?

25:00.967 --> 25:02.769
Walter! Language!

25:02.802 --> 25:05.037
Okay, so we're the egg.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.039
How are you gonna catch us?

25:07.073 --> 25:09.041
Delicately.
Now, first, Sly and Paige

25:09.075 --> 25:10.977
are gonna find a map
showing the flattest

25:11.010 --> 25:12.945
stretch of nearby land
for our runway.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.914
On it.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.983
And Sly will calculate the
necessary speed and angles

25:17.016 --> 25:18.718
for the crash
while the lighthouse team

25:18.751 --> 25:20.620
builds a crash zone
to slow the plane

25:20.653 --> 25:22.221
over the maximum amount
of time possible.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.657
Doc, you and Allie
keep flyboy calm.

25:24.691 --> 25:25.925
Cabe, let's see what
we've got to work with

25:25.958 --> 25:27.259
in the boathouse.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.997
WALTER:
Okay, according to Griffin,

25:31.030 --> 25:32.565
this is everything
that's on the plane

25:32.599 --> 25:34.934
It's not an exact match,
but it's close enough.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.103
Picnic basket, candle,
sleeping bag.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.839
Someone was planning a romantic
night under the stars.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.307
These are the cockpit's
dimensions.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.242
Okay, we need to use
the items on the plane

25:43.275 --> 25:44.210
to cushion cockpit impact.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.813
Like stuffing a turkey.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.582
Not really.
Well, yeah, kinda.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.917
Did you make those pancakes?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.585
Someone had to
take care of us.

25:52.619 --> 25:55.988
Make yourself useful
and blow up that raft.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.057
HAPPY: Okay, just
make yourself useful.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.726
Hold that lantern higher.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.060
Sheesh, grumpy.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.662
Yeah, I'm sorry.

26:02.695 --> 26:05.131
Just not how I thought
my, uh,

26:05.164 --> 26:06.966
lighthouse trip
would work out.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.035
Preachin' to the choir.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.638
I know, but I am trying
to make a baby,

26:11.671 --> 26:13.272
and it is not happening.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.273
It's getting to me.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.942
It'll be all right, kid.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.177
I don't want to talk
about me anymore.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.211
How about you?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.113
Did you drop the, uh, L-bomb

26:21.147 --> 26:23.149
on your little alley cat yet?

26:24.851 --> 26:27.053
Let's keep looking.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.155
And to answer your question,
no, I haven't told her.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.158
Saving the lives of two
kids takes precedence.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.761
You could have told her
months ago.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.063
You're scared she won't
say it back.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.631
She will.

26:38.665 --> 26:42.068
So just man up and,
uh, don't be a wuss.

26:42.101 --> 26:46.272
Yes. I think I just found
our plane catcher.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.407
(chair creaking)
Oh!

26:48.440 --> 26:49.842
Should I get Cabe?

26:49.876 --> 26:52.211
Sometimes you're not
the most... graceful.

26:52.244 --> 26:55.014
I'll have you know I was
voted best tumbler

26:55.047 --> 26:56.315
at P.S. 90 in Brooklyn.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.852
Oh... oh!
So, what's up there

26:59.886 --> 27:01.120
that's worth
breaking your neck over?

27:01.153 --> 27:04.957
Emergency landings have a high
probability of starting fires.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.092
I want to help prevent that.

27:06.125 --> 27:11.731
Okay, but I'm looking at
a fire extinguisher right now.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.866
That's a Class-A extinguisher.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.835
Fires involving liquids
and gases,

27:15.868 --> 27:17.036
that'll just spread
the flames.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.038
But the lighthouse was built
with a Halon

27:19.071 --> 27:21.407
fire suppression system.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.343
Okay, now we're ready
to play fireman.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.746
Good, 'cause we found
our runway.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.381
Just west of the lighthouse
is a one-kilometer stretch

27:29.415 --> 27:30.316
with no slope that terminates

27:30.349 --> 27:32.952
between the lighthouse
and the boathouse.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.087
Okay, that'll work.
We can use the palm trees

27:35.121 --> 27:37.089
as pick points
for the fishing nets.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.158
Fishing nets?

27:39.191 --> 27:42.261
Stretchy nylon nets.
They have a lot of give.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.196
They better, because
I'm done with the math.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.266
Griffin and Rachel are going
to experience 40 Gs of force

27:47.299 --> 27:48.367
when they crash.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.703
Ten Gs is on the higher end
of the survivable scale.

27:50.737 --> 27:54.006
Industrial nautical nylon
can cut down the G forces

27:54.040 --> 27:56.909
by, say, 20,
but we still need to lose

27:56.943 --> 27:58.310
another ten Gs,

27:58.344 --> 27:59.478
or else they'll die.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.180
(exhales)

28:08.154 --> 28:10.389
Whiz Kidz, let's do this!

28:10.422 --> 28:11.891
(wheels squeaking)

28:11.924 --> 28:15.161
(groaning)

28:22.802 --> 28:26.338
We got it-- the raft
absorbed 10.02 Gs of force.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.040
(chuckling)

28:31.477 --> 28:34.914
Okay, sweatshirts,
sleeping bags...

28:34.947 --> 28:36.448
And don't forget
the picnic basket.

28:36.482 --> 28:37.884
Wicker's pliable.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.418
Every bit of force
absorption counts.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.552
Now, inflate the raft.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.553
You'll only have a few seconds
to move it into position

28:41.587 --> 28:44.390
before the crash.
RACHEL: All right, got it.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.359
Okay, I-I see the
stretch of grass.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.761
That lady said one kilometer.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.329
It looks a lot
shorter than that.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.864
HAPPY:
It is what we said it is,

28:51.898 --> 28:53.866
so just relax and
line it up with the net,

28:53.900 --> 28:56.368
lower your speed,
and land on your belly.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.338
Yeah, that's not happening.
We need another plan.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.373
There's no other plan,
and this will work.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.777
I'm out. I'm sorry,
but I didn't sign up for this.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.545
I just wanted

29:06.578 --> 29:07.546
a nice weekend with Rachel.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.249
See the Hollywood sign,
the Santa Monica Pier.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.920
And after everything
was perfect...

29:13.953 --> 29:15.888
(quietly): ...I'd ask her
to be my girlfriend.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.524
Ooh, like Ralph and Patty.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.059
(laughs)

29:20.092 --> 29:22.194
CABE: Wait a minute,
you took Rachel

29:22.228 --> 29:23.930
on a moonlight plane ride,

29:23.963 --> 29:25.397
and she's not even your girl?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.801
She's been my best friend
since first grade.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.570
I was gonna ask her tonight,
but...

29:31.603 --> 29:33.405
Everything's a mess.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.008
Look, Griffin, come on, man,
you're too much in your head.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.543
You gotta put aside
all thoughts of Rachel

29:37.576 --> 29:40.179
and focus on the task at hand.
Wrong!

29:40.212 --> 29:42.448
You've been waiting on this
since grade school?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.016
Get over it already.

29:44.050 --> 29:47.820
You're scared that she won't
say it back, but she will.

29:47.854 --> 29:50.456
Now man up and quit
being a wuss and tell her.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.558
At least, that's the advice
that I got.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.860
Advice on what?

29:53.893 --> 29:57.596
On you.
I'm in love with you, okay?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.265
I was gonna
tell you proper

29:59.298 --> 30:01.067
when this is all over, but...

30:01.100 --> 30:03.535
I'm head over heels
for you, kid.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.039
I love you, too.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.545
CABE:
Okay, Griffin,

30:13.579 --> 30:16.115
my cards are on the table.

30:16.148 --> 30:20.119
CABE:
It's your turn.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.889
Rachel, I need
to say something.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.995
Hey... um...

30:29.028 --> 30:32.298
Rachel, you've been
my best friend

30:32.331 --> 30:34.133
since we were six years old.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.471
I've been in love with you
since we were seven.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.140
If we're gonna die,

30:41.173 --> 30:42.408
I don't want to die
without you knowing,

30:42.441 --> 30:44.443
so, uh...

30:44.476 --> 30:46.845
now you know.

30:50.416 --> 30:54.020
I've known since we were six.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.089
I love you, too.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.224
CABE:
Attaboy.

30:58.257 --> 31:01.027
Now you got something special
to live for, don't you?

31:01.060 --> 31:03.462
Yes, sir, I do.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.065
Okay, making my approach.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.199
Is that him?

31:07.233 --> 31:09.135
HAPPY: Uh, yeah.
He's going too fast.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.436
Griffin, lower the speed.

31:10.469 --> 31:13.439
I'm trying,
but the flaps aren't responding.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.407
Wha-- checking them now.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.081
I know what Happy would say
if she saw this.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.349
I'd say "not good." What is it?

31:23.382 --> 31:24.350
WALTER:
Well, when the float broke,

31:24.383 --> 31:25.517
a shard must've have hit
the flap

31:25.551 --> 31:27.153
and damaged it. We can't fix it.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.055
Then we're stuck up here.
SYLVESTER: Not for long.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.656
I've been keeping a tab
on you guys.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.925
You're gonna run out of fuel
in ten minutes.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.593
WALTER:
Okay. We have about ten minutes

31:34.626 --> 31:36.162
to figure out
how to land a busted plane

31:36.195 --> 31:37.296
before it runs out of fuel.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.497
We can't just sit here

31:38.530 --> 31:40.599
and watch them circle
until they crash.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.968
Excuse me?

31:42.001 --> 31:43.069
No, not now.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.436
But I have a question.
(stammers)

31:44.470 --> 31:45.637
The brownies are in
the cabinet, okay?

31:45.671 --> 31:47.339
Not my question.

31:47.373 --> 31:50.376
What I was gonna ask is, if you
know the plane's gonna crash,

31:50.409 --> 31:52.244
why not leave the plane?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.080
Wayne, now's not a good time.

31:54.113 --> 31:57.683
No, hold on. Meatball might have
a point. Uh, g-go on?

31:57.716 --> 31:59.685
You can catch them like an egg
in an egg toss.

31:59.718 --> 32:00.686
What?

32:00.719 --> 32:02.221
Or not.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.322
I'm not sure.

32:03.355 --> 32:07.393
Meatball, you are brilliant.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.128
Hey, Walter, you're talking
about human beings

32:09.161 --> 32:11.430
plummeting to Earth, not eggs.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.499
I did it from a space capsule.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.634
Yeah, but these guys don't
have a body of water

32:15.667 --> 32:17.369
or a torpedo to
break their fall.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.570
They just have a fall
to break their neck.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.805
WALTER:
Wrong.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.241
If we flip the nets from facing
the ocean to facing the sky,

32:22.274 --> 32:23.542
then it should have enough give

32:23.575 --> 32:25.411
to catch them
without killing them.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.013
Wha-- no, that is insane.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.447
That's never gonna work.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.050
It did work.
In 2016, a daredevil jumped

32:31.083 --> 32:33.452
from 25,000 feet,
without a parachute,

32:33.485 --> 32:36.055
and landed in a net
suspended off the ground.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.323
Right, well, that-that jump
was planned well in advance.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.492
These kids can't jump a second
too early or a second too late.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.194
TOBY: Sly, you up for this?
I don't know.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.462
There's too many variables.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.631
Wind speed, altitude,
wind direction.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.100
I need real time data,
and I can't get that information

32:48.134 --> 32:49.101
from any book.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.537
T-The lighthouse doubled
as a weather station.

32:51.570 --> 32:52.704
The equipment's
still functioning.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.306
Allie, little help?

32:54.340 --> 32:57.043
I'll get the other end
of the net. You get this end.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.211
Uh, what about us?

32:59.245 --> 33:01.180
You need to prepare
to put the plane into a stall.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.249
It's the only way to get
your speed close to zero

33:03.282 --> 33:04.383
relative to the ground.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.485
Just pull on the stick
until the nose is perpendicular

33:06.518 --> 33:08.420
to the ground,
so that there's no lift,

33:08.454 --> 33:10.356
and the plane will fall back
to Earth.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.192
Okay, uh, we got numbers.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.660
Wind speed's
three miles per hour.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.062
The temperature is 62 degrees.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.129
Wind direction, Allie?

33:17.163 --> 33:19.198
Uh, north by northwest.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.766
Okay, almost there.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.768
Griffin, you need
to stall the plane

33:22.801 --> 33:24.503
200 meters north of the net.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.505
All right, pointing the lantern
at the net now.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.776
Net's up and we got over
seven feet of stretch!

33:30.809 --> 33:32.678
GRIFFIN: Good, because
we're running out of fuel.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.713
Making my approach now.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.052
Okay, Griffin?

33:40.086 --> 33:41.587
Two things to keep in mind.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.455
One, you'll have to tie off
the stick,

33:43.489 --> 33:46.125
and you'll only have
one second to jump,

33:46.158 --> 33:47.459
and you can't be fiddling
with the controls.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.262
I can use my belt.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.298
And two, you guys have to jump
at the same time.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.765
If you don't,
whoever lands first will get

33:53.799 --> 33:56.235
all the net's stretch,
and whoever lands second...

33:56.268 --> 33:58.304
They'll be Humpty Dumpty.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.108
We've been in sync
for a long time now.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.810
We can do this.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.716
TOBY: Let's get these lovebirds
on the ground

34:10.749 --> 34:12.184
so they can smooch already, huh?

34:12.218 --> 34:14.120
We should get down there.

34:14.153 --> 34:15.654
RALPH: Birdroni's numbers say
Griffin should pull up...

34:16.688 --> 34:18.190
Now!
Now!

34:18.224 --> 34:18.790
Now.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.630
Okay, stick's in place!

34:24.663 --> 34:25.631
Go, go!

34:29.468 --> 34:30.636
(grunts)

34:33.505 --> 34:34.340
The plane stalled!

34:34.373 --> 34:36.608
WALTER:
Get ready to jump on my count.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.716
Three, two, one.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.619
Go!

34:49.621 --> 34:51.823
(both screaming)

34:57.229 --> 34:58.497
(both screaming)

35:11.510 --> 35:12.744
Man, this is tense.

35:12.778 --> 35:13.979
Quiet.

35:14.012 --> 35:16.782
I-I used to get nervous waiting
for a pop fly to come at me,

35:16.815 --> 35:18.150
but this is ridiculous.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.251
Shh!

35:20.552 --> 35:21.820
Ralph, plane?

35:21.853 --> 35:23.289
Fell a few hundred feet
and caught an updraft

35:23.322 --> 35:24.490
and glided out to sea.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.792
Guys on the ground should
have a visual any moment now.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.828
Ugh, this is too
tense, even for us.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.697
Hang in there, big guy.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.765
Thank you, Meatball.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.268
You know what? Thank you all.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.570
I have not been patient today,

35:38.604 --> 35:40.439
and you've all comported
yourselves admirably,

35:40.472 --> 35:41.773
despite my failings.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.875
You've even helped.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.844
True Whiz Kidz.

35:45.877 --> 35:46.945
You okay?

35:46.978 --> 35:49.815
We convinced two healthy teens
to jump out of a plane.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.883
Is that even legal?

35:52.918 --> 35:53.885
There!

35:54.920 --> 35:57.223
ALLIE:
That's them?

35:57.256 --> 35:58.324
Are you sure?

35:58.357 --> 35:59.925
They're so... tiny.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.860
They're getting bigger fast.

36:01.893 --> 36:04.196
HAPPY:
Hey, where are you going?

36:04.230 --> 36:06.598
Look, I trust Sly's math
and all, but if he's off,

36:06.632 --> 36:08.300
this is not how
I want to go out.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.971
CABE:
Crap, that really is them.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.207
(screaming)

36:17.243 --> 36:19.245
(gasping)

36:24.516 --> 36:26.652
Are they okay?

36:30.689 --> 36:32.591
(gasping, laughing)

36:32.624 --> 36:33.692
Yes!
Oh!

36:33.725 --> 36:35.561
Congrats, Sly!

36:35.594 --> 36:37.529
(cheering, clapping)

36:37.563 --> 36:38.730
(chuckles)

36:40.499 --> 36:41.467
Okay.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.968
I feel like that's over now.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.203
MEATBALL:
No, it's not.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.374
(both laughing)

36:52.978 --> 36:55.847
Man, what a first date, huh?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.519
That kid's got game.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.554
So do you.

37:07.793 --> 37:08.927
Not now.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.229
We got to take the net down.

37:13.365 --> 37:16.768
That's what happens
once you're married.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.972
(laser sound)

37:21.006 --> 37:22.441
Hello, keen viewers.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.775
My name is Walter O'Brien,

37:23.809 --> 37:25.677
and you're watching
Walt's Whiz Kidz.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.847
Now, today we'll be using
the classic egg drop experiment

37:28.880 --> 37:31.917
to demonstrate
what principles of physics?

37:31.950 --> 37:35.654
ALL: Creating drag to reduce
the force upon landing.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.656
WALTER:
That's exactly right.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.990
Now, we will be right back
with you

37:39.024 --> 37:40.759
to walk you through the steps.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.594
But remember,
if you have a science problem,

37:42.628 --> 37:44.963
don't take just any old kid
along with you to help.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.765
Take a whiz.

37:46.798 --> 37:47.999
(whirring sound)

37:53.605 --> 37:55.574
Um... s...

37:55.607 --> 37:56.775
Well said.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.076
Thank you, Toby.

37:58.109 --> 37:58.977
And...?

37:59.010 --> 38:01.012
(door opens)

38:01.046 --> 38:02.781
Hello, everyone.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.484
(door closes)

38:06.918 --> 38:08.954
I go should see
how Patty's doing.

38:08.987 --> 38:09.921
Yeah, I should pack.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.957
Yeah, I don't make excuses.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.667
FLORENCE: I have
positive news.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.969
After the electricity
came back on,

38:24.002 --> 38:27.072
I was able to teleconference
my investors.

38:27.105 --> 38:31.410
I was direct, as you suggested.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.545
And they've agreed to fund me.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.814
Florence, that's wonderful.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.383
Well, I owe you thanks.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.719
And I-I owe you an apology.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.922
I was, I was a bit short with
you, and I shouldn't have been.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.023
Yes.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.025
I noticed.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.661
I was worried that maybe
I had offended you.

38:49.695 --> 38:50.729
No, you didn't.

38:50.762 --> 38:51.863
You did nothing wrong.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.098
I was upset
about something else,

38:53.131 --> 38:57.135
something entirely not your
fault, and I took it out on you.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.639
That is illogical.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.441
But I'm relieved.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.042
I don't have
many friends,

39:04.075 --> 39:07.579
and I thought
you had become one.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.114
I have.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.983
Splendid.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.019
(chuckles softly)

39:14.052 --> 39:17.423
Well, I'll see
you tomorrow.

39:20.626 --> 39:21.993
(door closes)

39:22.027 --> 39:23.629
Great. Thank you.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.996
Checked in with
West Altadenia.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.064
Like L.A. county,

39:26.097 --> 39:28.066
they've got cell towers back up,

39:28.099 --> 39:29.768
and expect full power
by morning.

39:29.801 --> 39:30.802
Excellent. And the Whiz Kidz?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.404
Melanie and Tracy are home,

39:32.438 --> 39:34.005
and Meatball's calling his dad
from the trailer.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.641
Great job, guys.

39:35.674 --> 39:36.975
I was just wrangling the kids.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.176
Ralph really helped, though.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.711
Oh, no. Everyone contributed.

39:39.745 --> 39:40.779
Even Meatball.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.849
I think you make a good team.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.151
Maybe Ralph could
help you running

39:46.184 --> 39:48.053
my reelection campaign.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.621
Y-You'll run again next year?

39:49.655 --> 39:51.623
Our science club just helped
save two lives.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.024
We're making a difference.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.462
You up for being my
assistant campaign manager?

39:56.495 --> 39:57.796
It'll be really long hours

39:57.829 --> 39:59.030
working together.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.031
You have the time?

40:00.065 --> 40:02.468
I-I'll make the time.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.835
Excelsior.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.472
Now, how about some
celebration milkshakes, huh?

40:10.509 --> 40:11.643
Yes.
SYLVESTER:
Paige?

40:11.677 --> 40:13.044
I'm taking the kids
to Kovelsky's.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.046
Be back in an hour.
PAIGE:
Uh, bring me a chocolate?

40:15.080 --> 40:17.082
(door opens, closes)

40:19.184 --> 40:20.486
You hiding back here?

40:20.519 --> 40:21.653
No.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.154
Yes, you are.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.824
You're hiding because the woman
you dreamed about

40:25.857 --> 40:27.759
and your crazy girlfriend
were talking.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.094
And if I were you,
I'd hide, too.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.228
You would?

40:30.261 --> 40:31.730
Yep.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.232
Okay.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.203
Because I was unreasonable.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.871
And insecure.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.206
And wrong.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.542
Walter, I saw two teens today
trust each other

40:43.575 --> 40:45.076
with their lives,
jumping as one,

40:45.110 --> 40:48.747
so I should easily be able to
trust you with a stupid dream.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.116
The dream wasn't totally stupid.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.051
Okay...

40:53.084 --> 40:55.086
When I was almost dying,
my subconscious knew

40:55.120 --> 40:57.088
t-the only way out

40:57.122 --> 40:59.124
was to find you.
I-I trusted you

40:59.157 --> 41:02.794
to bring me back
from the brink of death.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.131
And I trust you.

41:08.734 --> 41:13.805
You know, Sly and the kids
won't be back for an hour.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.208
Hmm.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.710
MEATBALL: My father says
that the solar flare

41:18.744 --> 41:19.678
messed with
the wiring

41:19.711 --> 41:22.581
in his electric car,
so I'm sleeping over.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.883
(quietly):
Damn it.
