00:10.752 --> 00:12.693
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

00:13.426 --> 00:15.628
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:16.109 --> 00:17.074
Put your hands up!

00:17.075 --> 00:19.691
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza

00:19.692 --> 00:21.258
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

00:22.102 --> 00:23.700
Who the hell are you people?

00:24.054 --> 00:26.112
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.439 --> 00:29.146
<i>I know all this
because I'm living the same day...</i>

00:29.775 --> 00:31.308
<i>... over and over again.</i>

00:31.459 --> 00:34.159
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.680
<i>Every day, I get another chance.</i>

00:35.681 --> 00:38.026
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

00:38.027 --> 00:39.875
<i>Somehow this old murder case is the key.</i>

00:39.876 --> 00:42.561
<i>Turns out my sister Jennifer had
the missing piece of evidence.</i>

00:42.692 --> 00:43.899
Autopsy report.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.493
- When she died, she was pregnant.
- Isn't this Dad's handwriting?

00:46.494 --> 00:48.002
Who's Tobias Booth?

00:48.176 --> 00:50.484
I don't know why Garza's widow
was telling lies about me.

00:50.496 --> 00:53.655
Brett Hopper couldn't have killed
your husband, he was with me all night.

00:53.656 --> 00:55.267
I saw his face.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.693
<i>But I think I finally know
who's pulling the strings.</i>

00:57.731 --> 01:01.572
As Alberto Garza used to say,
hope is bigger than anyone of us.

01:02.126 --> 01:03.410
You cannot kill hope...

01:03.922 --> 01:04.932
with a bullet.

01:05.114 --> 01:07.081
<i>Now, I need to find out why.</i>

01:55.967 --> 01:57.712
Someone should call Mrs. Garza
at the club,

01:57.732 --> 01:59.614
tell her she can go home if she wants.

01:59.706 --> 02:01.714
I'm taking she wanna be
anywhere but here.

02:04.087 --> 02:06.071
How are we coming
on the arrest warrant for Hopper?

02:06.072 --> 02:07.847
Just signed out based on Mrs. Garza ID.

02:07.848 --> 02:10.705
As soon as we get the paper work,
we can knock on Hopper's door.

02:10.810 --> 02:12.357
Nothing worse than a cop going wrong.

02:12.908 --> 02:14.153
Makes us all look bad.

02:14.206 --> 02:15.661
Easy, Tiger, we'll get him.

02:17.823 --> 02:19.606
Should have it open any minute.

02:19.947 --> 02:21.781
You think Garza had any secrets?

02:22.973 --> 02:24.219
Everyone's got secret.

02:43.645 --> 02:44.615
Morning!

02:49.723 --> 02:50.732
Brett, your phone.

02:55.451 --> 02:57.522
It's Jennifer. Do you want me to get it?

02:57.523 --> 02:58.518
Thanks.

03:01.192 --> 03:02.189
Is everything OK?

03:09.796 --> 03:10.871
They threatened me.

03:11.199 --> 03:12.841
That's how they hurt Randall,
the kids...

03:12.842 --> 03:15.000
I know they were after Dad's briefcase.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.150
There's a document hidden
inside the lining.

03:17.151 --> 03:18.944
A document?
How could you possibly know that?

03:18.945 --> 03:20.865
Because these same men are after me.

03:20.957 --> 03:23.068
They're trying to frame me for murder.

03:23.985 --> 03:24.955
Murder?

03:25.630 --> 03:27.374
- You have to tell someone.
- Listen.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.659
We are gonna handle this.

03:28.660 --> 03:30.558
We're gonna take care of it ourselves.

03:30.559 --> 03:32.983
I'm gonna help you.
You gotta call this number.

03:32.984 --> 03:34.465
Take the briefcase to them.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.085
Ask for Fencik or Buchalter.

03:36.543 --> 03:38.679
- Alright, you got those names?
- Who are these people?

03:38.680 --> 03:40.345
They're ex-cops,
they're just muscle now,

03:40.346 --> 03:42.669
- I've been tracing them.
- It doesn't make any sense.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.147
Alright, listen, just pair with me.

03:44.159 --> 03:45.248
You got that photo?

03:50.932 --> 03:51.928
Who is she?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.000
This is Isabella Contreras.

03:54.621 --> 03:57.375
Somehow, everything was
back to her being murdered

03:57.820 --> 03:59.536
and them trying to cover it up.

03:59.589 --> 04:00.999
Do you know who killed her?

04:01.000 --> 04:01.970
Not yet.

04:02.468 --> 04:04.015
But I know who has my vote.

04:05.339 --> 04:06.308
Thank you.

04:09.507 --> 04:10.496
This hope center

04:11.413 --> 04:13.235
was the dream of Alberto Garza.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.779
A great believer
in the people of the city...

04:15.780 --> 04:17.338
So here's the guy in the monkey suit.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.466
Tobias Booth.

04:19.055 --> 04:20.051
City councilman.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.896
Friend of the common man,
pillar of the community.

04:22.897 --> 04:25.001
Why doesn't it sound like compliments?

04:25.002 --> 04:26.993
Because he's a liar,
a thug and a killer.

04:26.994 --> 04:29.981
...city of Los Angeles,
Alberto tirelessly paid...

04:29.982 --> 04:30.978
<i>Burn it all down.</i>

04:31.856 --> 04:33.232
<i>The cop who lost the book,</i>

04:34.956 --> 04:35.925
<i>the gang leader,</i>

04:37.675 --> 04:38.671
<i>the girl,</i>

04:40.781 --> 04:41.751
<i>kill them all.</i>

04:42.760 --> 04:44.759
<i>...but in distant memory,
I'd like to...</i>

04:44.910 --> 04:47.385
Is he behind the whole Garza thing
they're trying to pin on you?

04:47.386 --> 04:49.223
There might be a bigger fish,
but so far, yeah,

04:49.224 --> 04:50.865
all my evidence leads to Booth.

04:51.585 --> 04:53.054
Have you ever heard the Santayana Club?

04:53.055 --> 04:55.951
Yeah, bunch of rich old white guys,
try to act like rich old and white.

04:55.952 --> 04:57.039
Yeah, back in 91,

04:57.668 --> 05:00.435
they got this girl who who worked there
pregnant, Isabella Contreras.

05:00.853 --> 05:02.753
When Booth found out about the baby,

05:02.754 --> 05:04.038
he had Isabella killed.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.980
Everything that's going down today
goes back to that murder.

05:08.029 --> 05:08.993
But why now?

05:09.130 --> 05:10.965
I mean, why after all this time?

05:11.358 --> 05:12.970
I have to work it to find out.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.042
... by the sound of the gun fire.

05:15.913 --> 05:18.417
This is definitely better
than a day in I.A.

05:25.762 --> 05:26.771
Not now!

05:26.902 --> 05:29.969
- Got Andrea Battle in five minutes.
- No, you don't.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.541
- She just cancelled.
- What?

05:31.542 --> 05:33.802
You don't cancel I.A.
Let me talk to her.

05:33.881 --> 05:35.126
She... left a message.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.655
Was she looking a work security
in Loserville?

05:37.656 --> 05:39.845
I'll just get her on the phone for you.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.270
I've got a better idea.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.705
Go over Chinatown,
see her snitch Danny Yan.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.955
If Danny Yan's connected,
he's not gonna talk.

05:48.956 --> 05:51.157
I'm closing this case today,
with or without Battle.

05:51.158 --> 05:52.155
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:52.764 --> 05:53.733
<i>And now,</i>

05:54.140 --> 05:56.118
as proof of our resounding yes,

05:56.368 --> 05:57.351
let me introduce

05:57.614 --> 06:01.335
one of the greatest success stories
of our entire gang initiative:

06:01.924 --> 06:06.323
Lewis Torrez joined the Latin Disciples
at the age of fourteen.

06:06.823 --> 06:09.983
Today, Lewis is a member
of my staff and a...

06:09.984 --> 06:12.211
I wonder what he really does for Booth.

06:12.722 --> 06:13.785
Why don't you ask him?

06:15.022 --> 06:17.172
I haven't been able
to get close enough to him.

06:17.644 --> 06:21.275
Besides, Booth isn't the type of guy
you wanna go toe to toe with.

06:23.112 --> 06:25.332
You told me he's untouchable.
How are gonna get to him?

06:25.333 --> 06:27.372
You cannot kill hope with a bullet.

06:33.814 --> 06:34.823
I just did.

06:38.430 --> 06:39.150
+

06:43.541 --> 06:44.511
What did you do?

06:45.101 --> 06:46.071
Scared him.

06:46.338 --> 06:47.320
Get Mrs. Garza.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.138
Scared people make mistakes.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.982
Yeah, we're gonna be right there
when he makes his.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.263
You saw your brother this morning?

07:01.832 --> 07:04.502
You've already decided he did it.
Haven't you?

07:05.087 --> 07:07.677
Anything he sent to you can help us
exonerate him.

07:07.769 --> 07:08.961
My father was a cop.

07:09.604 --> 07:10.566
Drop the act.

07:10.771 --> 07:13.202
OK, why did your brother kill
Alberto Garza?

07:13.242 --> 07:14.211
He didn't.

07:14.395 --> 07:15.510
He's being framed

07:15.883 --> 07:17.941
by the same men who are after me.

07:19.645 --> 07:20.621
It's the truth.

07:21.565 --> 07:24.225
About a week ago, two men approached me.

07:24.632 --> 07:27.311
They said they wanted
some of my father's old things

07:27.312 --> 07:29.054
and if I didn't give it to them,

07:29.055 --> 07:31.716
they were gonna kill my husband
and my children.

07:32.548 --> 07:34.317
Why didn't you go to the police?

07:34.593 --> 07:35.746
Do you have kids?

07:37.515 --> 07:41.467
I will do whatever I have to do
to keep my family safe

07:41.468 --> 07:44.875
and these men made it very clear
what I could and couldn't do.

07:45.323 --> 07:46.989
Any idea why you're set?

07:49.611 --> 07:51.184
Because Brett is helping me.

07:51.787 --> 07:55.496
Because he tracked them. He found out
their names : Fencik and Buchalter.

07:55.497 --> 07:58.760
They're ex-cops and the same men
who are framing him.

07:59.585 --> 08:01.879
A mess of conspiracy, how convenient.

08:09.536 --> 08:11.424
Why don't you call them yourself?

08:23.450 --> 08:25.088
We should look into these guys.

08:25.089 --> 08:27.749
Don't tell me you believe her.
We got a positive ID from Mrs. Garza!

08:27.750 --> 08:29.828
- It's just a phone call.
- She's Hopper's sister!

08:29.829 --> 08:31.345
She tell us anything
to get him off the hook!

08:31.383 --> 08:34.081
She wants him off the hook!

08:34.082 --> 08:35.062
Fine.

08:35.183 --> 08:38.328
And if you see any little green men,
tell 'em I said hi.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.516
- Now I see why Booth's here.
- That's the grieving widow?

09:01.517 --> 09:04.072
Don't let the costume fool you,
she's in on it.

09:04.383 --> 09:06.840
Please! Step back. Excuse me...

09:06.841 --> 09:08.151
Catch that photo op.

09:10.956 --> 09:12.961
Protecting her the time I need.

09:15.204 --> 09:17.366
You can't elaborate...

09:20.992 --> 09:21.956
Who are you calling?

09:21.957 --> 09:24.701
Someone who might know
Booth's gang banger friend.

09:29.879 --> 09:30.986
Where you at, Hop?

09:31.359 --> 09:33.083
Been trying to reach you
since last night!

09:33.084 --> 09:35.534
I know about last night,
I'll get to the skinheads in a minute.

09:35.535 --> 09:38.012
Skinheads? How do you know
about the skinheads?

09:38.013 --> 09:40.988
I just know, OK? I promise you
I'll take care of it. Listen to me.

09:41.504 --> 09:43.315
I need some information
on a Latin Disciple,

09:43.316 --> 09:45.174
an ex-gang banger named Torrez.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.490
- This ain't about what you need!
- Come on, Damien!

09:48.529 --> 09:49.853
- Help me!
- Sorry, Hop'.

09:50.076 --> 09:51.492
I've got an empire to build.

09:54.213 --> 09:57.379
- Problem with your CI?
- Yeah... I'll deal with him later.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.914
We need to get in that house.

09:58.915 --> 09:59.881
Here's a plan.

10:00.543 --> 10:02.738
Marching to the crime team
with public enemy number 1 ?

10:02.739 --> 10:03.996
Could you handle that?

10:04.290 --> 10:06.761
I forgot how much fun
it was being your partner.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.301
We're closed.

10:31.793 --> 10:33.699
Detective Choi, Robbery/Homicide.

10:34.553 --> 10:35.755
Looking for the owner.

10:35.755 --> 10:38.050
- His name is Fenshik.
- That's Fencik.

10:38.996 --> 10:41.490
- He ain't in.
- You know when he'll be back?

10:41.491 --> 10:42.471
No.

10:43.658 --> 10:44.657
OK.

10:46.267 --> 10:47.389
If you see him...

10:54.959 --> 10:57.728
That's supposed to make yourself
more American?

10:58.068 --> 11:00.922
Tell Mr. Fencik he needs
to get in touch with me today.

11:01.184 --> 11:03.411
I have some questions
I'd like to ask him.

11:14.735 --> 11:17.455
There're pictures of you
and Andrea Battle all over Chinatown.

11:18.368 --> 11:20.172
Photos of her giving you pay offs.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.827
We know that's not CI money, so?

11:22.860 --> 11:24.267
You're selling some drugs, or what?

11:25.839 --> 11:27.561
You got it all wrong, Officer.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.789
Sergent.

11:30.070 --> 11:31.049
Sarge...

11:31.917 --> 11:35.069
I'm just a small time entrepeneur...
friend of the force.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.218
Yeah, small time.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.132
Clubs are major cover for drugs
and prostitution.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.656
We know you answer
to the Kwai Long syndicate.

11:43.159 --> 11:47.011
That sounds to me like you've been
watching too many Bruce Lee movies.

11:47.135 --> 11:48.426
You know what I think ?

11:50.153 --> 11:52.166
I think this is not about me at all.

11:53.457 --> 11:55.695
I think this is a beef
between you and...

11:56.739 --> 11:57.735
Charlie's Angel.

11:59.111 --> 12:01.359
But it ain't my fault
she got a junkie boyfriend

12:01.360 --> 12:03.849
with bad credit
and a soft spot for strays.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.729
Do you know where Battle is or not?

12:07.730 --> 12:08.708
I can't tell you,

12:09.138 --> 12:10.343
but if you see her,

12:10.760 --> 12:11.841
send her my love.

12:13.304 --> 12:15.928
Now if we're finished here,
I got a business to run.

12:21.095 --> 12:23.617
You know, they go real nice
with a little rice and wasabi.

12:27.054 --> 12:30.153
You go to the SPA. Do let me know
how things works up with Gar, yeah?

12:35.285 --> 12:37.559
Keep walking around,
nothing to see here.

12:38.178 --> 12:39.248
What's in the back?

12:40.014 --> 12:41.106
I'll meet you, buddy.

12:42.489 --> 12:43.509
My pitbull.

12:44.129 --> 12:45.964
Oh, yeah? I love dogs.

12:46.482 --> 12:47.442
What's his name?

12:49.759 --> 12:50.772
Can I pet Baxter?

12:50.928 --> 12:53.822
No men, you know what, he's sick
but you can pet this if you like.

12:53.823 --> 12:55.194
That's really neat.

12:55.532 --> 12:57.029
I got one of those myself,

12:57.030 --> 12:59.470
except mine came
with a really shiny badge.

13:30.379 --> 13:31.349
Your safe, here.

13:31.612 --> 13:33.406
I thought it was taken care of it.

13:33.499 --> 13:34.498
It was.

13:34.812 --> 13:37.662
I didn't know there was anything else.

13:37.663 --> 13:39.831
Well, someone else clearly did.

13:39.997 --> 13:41.718
Did you ever think to check the safe?

13:48.854 --> 13:50.048
What are you doing in here ?

13:50.049 --> 13:51.939
This is an active crime scene, sir.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.572
And you two shouldn't be back here.

13:53.573 --> 13:54.867
This is Mrs. Garza.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.562
I'm helping her to gather some things.

13:56.563 --> 13:58.461
Right now,
you're tampering with evidence.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.806
Now, I'd ask you to leave.

14:00.786 --> 14:02.925
- What's your name?
- I don't see how that's relevant.

14:03.612 --> 14:04.772
Your name...

14:06.935 --> 14:09.028
Thank you for your diligence,
Detective Battle,

14:09.029 --> 14:11.292
I'll be sure to mention
it to your chief.

14:11.293 --> 14:13.193
We're playing golf in the morning.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.530
Give him my best.

14:27.309 --> 14:30.462
Yeah, it's cool on tonight schedule.
Booth says we gotta move forward.

14:30.463 --> 14:31.969
Can't wait anything the way it was.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.137
At the summit.

14:35.557 --> 14:36.789
Stand up slowly.

14:37.248 --> 14:38.611
Step away from the door.

14:40.407 --> 14:42.150
I'm a cop, I'm gonna show you my badge.

14:42.530 --> 14:43.539
Alright?

14:45.116 --> 14:46.806
Did you notice that this door was open?

14:46.807 --> 14:47.960
- No, sir.
- Why not?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.896
Did you check for signs of forced entry?

14:51.250 --> 14:52.639
I got this ID over here right away.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.832
Why don't you do that?

15:02.951 --> 15:03.960
You're a dead man.

15:06.660 --> 15:07.380
+

15:08.193 --> 15:11.076
You can't make me go away
as easy as Isabella Contreras.

15:11.312 --> 15:12.820
And before this day is done

15:13.685 --> 15:16.110
everyone's gonna know
the truth about you.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.154
Help!

15:19.429 --> 15:20.975
Over here! I need help!

15:30.460 --> 15:32.295
This way! He's running this way!

15:32.832 --> 15:35.126
There! That Hopper! He killed Garza.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.062
Go back to garage, now.

15:39.141 --> 15:40.150
No more screw-ups.

15:47.218 --> 15:48.180
Who is that?

16:11.125 --> 16:13.444
Yeah, thanks for coming back to me,
Mr. Fencik.

16:13.445 --> 16:15.135
Sure, when do you want to meet?

16:15.667 --> 16:16.676
Where's that?

16:19.376 --> 16:20.700
OK, I'll see you there.

16:48.582 --> 16:49.592
What's up?

16:52.475 --> 16:53.445
Torrez.

16:55.870 --> 16:56.831
What's up?

17:06.672 --> 17:07.904
<i>You're here, Hop'?</i>

17:08.192 --> 17:09.162
Tell me, bro.

17:09.989 --> 17:12.097
- Damien!
- Why the hell are you whispering?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.888
Listen, I need some info
on Lewis Torrez.

17:14.890 --> 17:16.777
He's pretty high up
in the pecking order.

17:16.778 --> 17:18.328
He kicks it with the city councilman.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.259
I could tell you a lot of things.
But I got problems on my own.

17:21.345 --> 17:22.309
I got bagged.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.028
<i>I need you to call them and tell them
I'm your CI. Get me out of here!</i>

17:25.029 --> 17:26.090
What happened?

17:26.109 --> 17:29.019
I was over in Chinatown and some cop
just decided to make photo of me.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.811
- What were you doing in Chinatown?
- Well, what I do.

17:31.903 --> 17:34.301
Me and my boys
went to a gentlemen's club.

17:34.367 --> 17:35.665
Not the One Band.

17:36.235 --> 17:38.175
I had a lucky guess
that you'd be following me.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.900
I know that Slim runs the street joint
for the Kwai Long.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.798
and I know the Kwai Long has been
in war with the Latin Disciple, so

17:44.014 --> 17:45.172
why would you hang with them?

17:45.246 --> 17:46.969
It's a help-help situation, Hop.

17:47.336 --> 17:50.404
You want answers to your questions?
Get me out of here!

18:20.150 --> 18:23.348
I'll be back after the summit.
This is good for all of us, <i>hermanos.</i>

18:23.349 --> 18:24.344
See you, man.

18:52.057 --> 18:53.327
You Choi?

18:54.625 --> 18:55.621
Mr. Fencik.

18:56.564 --> 18:58.295
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with me.

18:58.296 --> 18:59.970
I just had a couple of questions
for you.

18:59.971 --> 19:02.370
- What it's about?
- A homicide investigation.

19:02.551 --> 19:03.606
Your name came up.

19:04.631 --> 19:06.598
Really? How?

19:09.167 --> 19:10.176
I'm just asking.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.096
Your name comes up
in a murder investigation,

19:12.097 --> 19:13.243
you're not gonna ask how?

19:13.244 --> 19:14.252
I understand.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.865
You know a man named Brett Hopper?

19:19.298 --> 19:20.556
I can't say that I do.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.434
Hey, can I get some more peanuts here?

19:26.747 --> 19:28.979
Good service is hard to come by
these days.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.976
Yeah.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.398
- You hang on here regularly?
No.

19:32.856 --> 19:37.221
I had some other business here tonight,
kinda fell appart at the last minute.

19:37.487 --> 19:39.393
But what I do like about this place...

19:39.394 --> 19:41.649
is they don't really care if we do this.

19:46.515 --> 19:47.891
How about those peanuts?

19:49.170 --> 19:49.890
+

20:00.785 --> 20:02.279
I didn't want to wake you.

20:02.570 --> 20:03.605
I wasn't sleeping.

20:12.175 --> 20:14.397
- I didn't call you today, did I?
- No.

20:14.802 --> 20:16.257
- You didn't.
- I'm sorry.

20:16.296 --> 20:18.878
Somewhat has been happening,
I thought you'd be safe with Chad.

20:18.879 --> 20:20.399
But then I didn't see his car.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.251
- Why would Chad's car...
- Never mind...

20:22.788 --> 20:26.144
I just had a lot of calls to make
and I know that you're pissed.

20:26.145 --> 20:28.350
You have every right to be.
I just...

20:29.830 --> 20:31.796
I know, baby, I just forgot.

20:32.478 --> 20:33.461
And I'm sorry.

20:35.529 --> 20:36.524
But you...

20:36.801 --> 20:38.672
You knew that I'd do this, right?

20:39.550 --> 20:42.017
I would run and round all day
with Andrea trying to prove it.

20:42.018 --> 20:42.983
Wait.

20:43.258 --> 20:46.219
You had time to tell Andrea
you're wanted for murder?

20:46.849 --> 20:48.707
Yeah, she's a cop. She can help.

20:49.386 --> 20:50.369
But I can't?

20:50.920 --> 20:51.913
I didn't say that.

20:51.914 --> 20:53.486
Where have you been all day?

20:54.280 --> 20:57.491
I got in a little trouble but...
it's not what we're talking about now.

20:57.544 --> 20:58.554
Really?

20:59.302 --> 21:01.451
What is we're talking about right now?

21:02.048 --> 21:03.039
Rita, I'm...

21:04.285 --> 21:05.252
I'm sorry.

21:05.252 --> 21:08.949
You know, one of the great things
about having someone to love, Brett...

21:08.950 --> 21:10.873
Is that you can tell them anything.

21:15.563 --> 21:17.241
I can't believe you just told me that!

21:17.242 --> 21:18.904
I thought I could tell you anything!

21:18.905 --> 21:21.094
Yes, you can. But you can't say
"Hey, by the way

21:21.095 --> 21:24.765
"I'll be falsely accused of murder
this morning. See you later honey".

21:27.196 --> 21:28.166
I got nothing.

21:30.191 --> 21:31.903
Did you know about these charges
last night?

21:31.904 --> 21:33.009
Yes... No!

21:33.809 --> 21:35.947
It depends on what you mean
when you say 'last night'.

21:35.948 --> 21:37.115
Last night last night.

21:37.207 --> 21:38.963
Chinese food... Fooling around.

21:39.415 --> 21:40.936
But did you forget about that part too?

21:40.936 --> 21:43.434
No! Of course not baby!

21:47.391 --> 21:49.160
- Is this Andrea now?
- No.

21:49.653 --> 21:51.474
She d... I'm gonna tell her right now.

21:51.475 --> 21:53.939
Do a better job telling her
than you did me.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.066
OK.

22:03.148 --> 22:04.115
Uh... Yeah.

22:04.482 --> 22:07.116
And now, as proof of our resounding yes,

22:07.117 --> 22:10.010
Let me introduce
one of the greatest success stories

22:10.124 --> 22:11.897
of our anti gang initiative.

22:13.108 --> 22:14.091
Lewis Torrez.

22:14.222 --> 22:15.335
Can't stay long.

22:15.336 --> 22:17.845
One deliver voice mail for Shelten
pushed back the IA meeting

22:17.846 --> 22:19.864
But Sgt. Slaughter was at his desk.

22:19.865 --> 22:22.630
He found himself at the top
of the gang pyramide.

22:23.075 --> 22:27.675
He was prosecuted by Alberto Garza
3 years ago and sentenced to prison.

22:27.676 --> 22:31.067
So Torrez is a liaison
between Booth and a Disciple.

22:31.103 --> 22:32.161
I thought he was reformed?

22:32.200 --> 22:34.205
If he's reformed, I'm Dick Chenney.

22:34.906 --> 22:38.629
Today, police is the key contributed
to the community...

22:38.812 --> 22:40.794
Torrez runs guns
for the Latin Disciples.

22:40.795 --> 22:42.987
He's going to some summit
that's going down tonight.

22:42.988 --> 22:43.992
What's it about?

22:44.138 --> 22:46.019
I don't know.
I gotta go down to Chinatown

22:46.136 --> 22:48.188
to check down my CI Damien.

22:48.506 --> 22:50.364
See if he can fill in any blanks.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.748
Do you need me to drag Torres
down at the station

22:53.843 --> 22:56.155
and get a location out of him?

22:56.758 --> 22:58.876
Scary how you read my mind sometimes.

23:00.139 --> 23:01.135
Come on.

23:13.883 --> 23:14.853
Excuse me.

23:15.039 --> 23:16.371
It's your vehicule sir?

23:16.778 --> 23:17.773
Huh, yeah.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.823
- Anything stolen?
- I'm not sure.

23:21.327 --> 23:22.863
You should probably check out thoroughly

23:22.864 --> 23:24.638
and report it,
it'll help with the insurance.

23:24.639 --> 23:26.354
Thank you.
I'll do that later.

23:27.048 --> 23:29.555
- There's no need to be hostile.
- Hostile?

23:29.594 --> 23:30.603
Calm down, sir.

23:31.859 --> 23:32.868
I am calm.

23:33.726 --> 23:35.142
What's under the blanket?

23:36.965 --> 23:38.695
Open the door and step aside.

23:39.590 --> 23:41.263
Do you know who the hell I am?

23:42.433 --> 23:44.802
I was just up on stage
with councilman Booth.

23:44.803 --> 23:47.406
And this morning,
I had breakfast with Count Chocula.

23:47.589 --> 23:49.595
Now open the door, and step aside.

24:03.048 --> 24:04.187
Correct me if I'm wrong,

24:04.188 --> 24:06.980
but didn't councilman Booth say
that you did time?

24:09.293 --> 24:11.666
Sure hope this isn't your third strike.

24:16.469 --> 24:19.222
Scuse me, I'm looking for the detectives
in charge of the Garza case.

24:19.223 --> 24:21.096
Well, you're having me. Detective Choi.

24:21.097 --> 24:23.495
I'm Rita Shelten,
one of your detectives called me.

24:23.770 --> 24:26.936
I'd like to talk to you about
my boyfriend, Brett Hopper.

24:27.538 --> 24:28.509
Come with me.

24:31.256 --> 24:33.275
This whole thing is a huge mistake.

24:33.289 --> 24:34.482
Brett's being framed.

24:38.335 --> 24:39.894
What's this supposed to mean?

24:39.938 --> 24:42.586
Well, at least you all have
your story straight.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.927
Look, Hopper's sister was in here
earlier repeating the same thing.

24:45.928 --> 24:46.989
OK, first off...

24:47.487 --> 24:49.781
I resent your tone.
Brett was with me all night.

24:49.782 --> 24:51.217
So basically you're calling me a liar.

24:51.218 --> 24:52.410
I never said that, Ms. Shelten.

24:52.411 --> 24:55.176
And second, I don't think
you understand the kind of man Brett is.

24:55.177 --> 24:57.096
He lives his job 24/7.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.407
He believes in it.

24:58.962 --> 25:01.248
That's the kind of guy
who'd charge into a burning building

25:01.249 --> 25:02.279
to save a stranger.

25:03.576 --> 25:05.097
You're after the wrong man.

25:07.762 --> 25:08.759
Excuse me.

25:11.419 --> 25:13.765
Got something upon the guy
the sister mentioned, Fencik.

25:13.766 --> 25:16.098
He owns a chop shop in Chasworth.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.552
You might wanna check it out.

25:17.553 --> 25:19.391
I thought you said
this was a waste of time.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.960
Probably is, but at least
it will look you did the leg work.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.085
You're late.

25:35.453 --> 25:36.966
Guys in narcotics, looking for you.

25:36.967 --> 25:39.120
Yeah, I know, I'll be in
as soon as I process this guy.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.381
We do this now. Come on.

25:42.819 --> 25:44.194
Go ahead and get started.

25:44.195 --> 25:46.030
I'll be back to question him in a bit.

25:46.057 --> 25:48.259
You're making a big mistake, <i>mi reina</i>!

25:48.736 --> 25:51.240
Then how come you're the queen
going to jail?

26:00.792 --> 26:02.746
I've nothing to tell you, <i>perro</i>

26:03.532 --> 26:04.502
<i> Do you hear me?<i/></i>

26:06.633 --> 26:08.848
<i>Put the guns down
or we're gonna put you down.<i/></i>

26:10.500 --> 26:11.496
<i>Put 'em down!<i/></i>

26:16.144 --> 26:17.599
I'm coming at a bad time?

26:17.600 --> 26:18.975
Nah, come on in, uh?

26:19.638 --> 26:20.987
And close the damn door.

26:22.470 --> 26:23.280
+

26:26.080 --> 26:27.862
Alright, now on the count of three,

26:28.007 --> 26:29.737
we're all gonna lower our guns.

26:30.890 --> 26:31.851
One...

26:33.546 --> 26:34.555
Two...

26:36.076 --> 26:37.072
Three.

26:43.553 --> 26:44.549
It was worth a try.

26:44.785 --> 26:46.607
What the hell are you doing here?

26:46.608 --> 26:47.695
How do you know this cop?

26:47.748 --> 26:49.071
Oh, me and D, we go a way back.

26:50.021 --> 26:52.590
We got the same thing going on
as you and my partner,

26:52.591 --> 26:53.587
Andrea Battle.

26:54.790 --> 26:55.800
You and Battle...

26:56.717 --> 26:57.726
Is that a fact?

26:58.788 --> 27:00.426
Cast no stones, friend.

27:09.915 --> 27:12.346
Now that you two are caught up,
will somebody please explain me

27:12.347 --> 27:14.005
what you're doing hanging together?

27:14.269 --> 27:16.340
Cause the last time I checked,
Kwai Long and LDs

27:16.983 --> 27:18.765
didn't play the same sand box.

27:19.355 --> 27:22.171
This little party has anything to do
with Torrez's got going on tonight?

27:24.312 --> 27:25.307
D?

27:26.081 --> 27:27.104
Outside.

27:27.786 --> 27:28.938
We're not done here.

27:40.232 --> 27:42.513
- Where did you get in this stuff, Hop'?
- Come on, D...

27:42.514 --> 27:45.736
I know Torrez is working on some kind
of a deal with councilman Booth.

27:45.737 --> 27:48.896
And this has nothing to do
with any anti-gang initiative.

27:49.338 --> 27:50.439
Torrez is a trader man.

27:50.990 --> 27:52.442
He's selling out the soul of the LDs,

27:52.443 --> 27:54.097
making deals with baby kissers
like Booth.

27:54.098 --> 27:55.590
But what's Torrez getting out of it?

27:55.591 --> 27:56.587
Protection.

27:57.229 --> 27:59.116
He gets to move his product
uninterrupted.

27:59.117 --> 28:01.421
- So he's out of retirement.
- Retired?

28:01.422 --> 28:03.297
He didn't even
take the week-end off, Hop'.

28:03.326 --> 28:06.052
Meanwhile Booth gets the cut of
his profits and a nice public victory.

28:06.053 --> 28:07.650
Just in time for campaign season.

28:07.651 --> 28:08.647
Public victory?

28:09.015 --> 28:10.338
What do you mean, like bust?

28:12.449 --> 28:14.611
You were planning to turn in Torrez
at the Feds, uh?

28:15.515 --> 28:17.495
That's what Baxter wanted
to testify about.

28:17.523 --> 28:19.306
LD's supposed to be family, man.

28:19.634 --> 28:22.163
See Torrez, he don't care about
how many <i>hermanos</i> get sold out.

28:22.177 --> 28:25.046
As long as he gets his house in burbs
and a fat corporate expense account.

28:25.047 --> 28:26.677
That's why you're here,
meeting with Slim.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.202
So you can put yourself together
a little rebel alliance.

28:29.766 --> 28:32.540
Take Torrez out, maybe grab yourself
a corner office while you're at it.

28:32.541 --> 28:33.622
Spoils of war, Hop'.

28:34.739 --> 28:38.008
Besides, ain't gonna be no sacrificial
lamb for some White politicians.

28:38.009 --> 28:40.630
Now, what about this summit
Torrez has going on tonight.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.125
You wanna think about that?

28:42.453 --> 28:43.449
No, man.

28:43.540 --> 28:45.834
Maybe he's gearing up
to make a round at me.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.053
No offense,

28:47.054 --> 28:49.721
but I doubt he'd need a crate
full of guns for that.

28:50.823 --> 28:51.793
What guns?

28:53.821 --> 28:55.158
Hey, Ballanger!

28:55.329 --> 28:56.613
What happened to my collar?

28:56.847 --> 28:59.141
Told you to process the guy,
now I hear he's getting loose.

28:59.142 --> 29:01.122
Look, I booked the guy.
Then he made a phone call.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.654
Next thing I know, they tell me
the charges have been dropped.

29:03.655 --> 29:05.505
- Who did he call?
- I don't know.

29:12.754 --> 29:14.812
This garage we're going to...

29:14.995 --> 29:16.620
What kind of heavy metal you see?

29:16.621 --> 29:17.931
Like real heavy.

29:18.167 --> 29:20.116
Fully automatic military grade

29:20.210 --> 29:21.940
- You sure these were LDs?
- Yeah.

29:22.412 --> 29:23.552
Torrez is with them.

29:24.310 --> 29:26.434
He had a crate of this stuff,
he's supposed to leave it

29:26.435 --> 29:27.989
to the summit that's going down tonight.

29:27.990 --> 29:30.225
This don't sound like
no casual meeting great to me, Hop.

29:31.078 --> 29:32.861
Sounds like they're gearing up for war.

29:33.319 --> 29:34.316
War with who?

29:38.137 --> 29:40.746
You waste these fools,
I get first digs on the guns though.

29:51.639 --> 29:53.278
What happened to the weapons?

29:55.020 --> 29:55.991
You.

29:56.502 --> 29:57.688
- Where's the summit?

29:58.889 --> 30:00.816
- Yeah, right.
- Ho, don't worry, Hop.

30:01.327 --> 30:02.847
We speak the same language.

30:04.172 --> 30:05.548
<i>Hablas</i> Smith & Wesson?

30:11.195 --> 30:12.426
Hey, Andrea, what's up?

30:12.427 --> 30:13.528
Torrez was let out.

30:13.659 --> 30:14.851
Charges were dropped.

30:15.127 --> 30:17.263
- Booth for progress.
- Yeah, that's what I thought too

30:17.264 --> 30:19.335
but before he was released,
he made a phone call,

30:19.336 --> 30:21.221
and it wasn't to Booth,
<i>it was to a bar</i>.

30:21.222 --> 30:22.933
- A bar?
- <i>Yeah, and it gets better.</i>

30:22.934 --> 30:25.451
The place is called The Summit.
It's a biker hangout downtown.

30:25.452 --> 30:27.463
- <i>You want the address?</i>
- Yeah.

30:28.990 --> 30:29.957
We gotta go.

30:30.327 --> 30:31.533
What about these two?

30:35.632 --> 30:37.376
Torrez is gonna hit the skinheads.

30:37.428 --> 30:39.080
That explains the fire power.

30:39.499 --> 30:41.647
- It should be a blood bath.
- I know, we gotta move.

30:41.648 --> 30:43.870
We? Bud, you got a mouse in your pocket?

30:43.975 --> 30:45.378
My own people want me dead.

30:45.551 --> 30:46.532
Skinheads do too.

30:47.450 --> 30:49.943
That's what Sun Tzu would call
a lose-lose situation.

30:50.047 --> 30:51.056
Then what, is that a no ?

31:06.481 --> 31:09.641
Consider this as a start.
Seven guns per case.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.800
Ten cases total.
That's seventy guns on the street.

31:12.878 --> 31:16.287
Booth is guaranteeing us protection
from Jambo to Tijuana.

31:16.601 --> 31:18.501
Cops like this one will be sport.

31:20.193 --> 31:22.617
There is nothing
that can stand in our way.

31:23.351 --> 31:26.065
All we have to do is get along.

31:33.774 --> 31:34.783
Get out!

31:39.818 --> 31:41.089
What's up, fellows?

31:48.553 --> 31:49.549
You shoot,

31:50.113 --> 31:51.109
you die.

31:54.210 --> 31:54.930
+

31:59.641 --> 32:00.639
Choi, you OK ?

32:01.298 --> 32:02.528
Do I look OK to you?

32:03.883 --> 32:06.267
You be easy Fencik
or one of these coming right at you.

32:07.778 --> 32:08.807
I gotta say,

32:08.832 --> 32:11.078
I thought I was showing up
for a rumble in the jungle.

32:11.292 --> 32:14.078
But instead,
this is one big happy love fest.

32:16.525 --> 32:17.815
These guns are for war ?

32:18.066 --> 32:19.078
They're peace offering.

32:20.463 --> 32:21.868
A skinhead alliance

32:22.144 --> 32:23.538
with the Latin Disciple.

32:24.629 --> 32:25.784
All brokered

32:26.004 --> 32:27.259
by councilman Booth

32:27.974 --> 32:29.632
and his little lapdog.

32:30.673 --> 32:32.430
You're not gonna make it
outta here alive.

32:32.530 --> 32:33.522
That's ok.

32:33.810 --> 32:34.856
As neither are you.

32:36.727 --> 32:37.793
Tell me something, Este.

32:38.558 --> 32:40.351
How many of your crew
did you have to give up

32:41.043 --> 32:42.587
for that hand-tailored suit, uh?

32:43.541 --> 32:45.528
Twenty? Thirty percent?

32:46.518 --> 32:47.499
And you're...

32:48.201 --> 32:50.158
calling yourself White Sea Premise.

32:51.007 --> 32:53.764
Listen to this Latino promise you

32:54.027 --> 32:56.261
a bigger a piece
of your own American dream.

32:57.014 --> 32:59.286
What makes you think
Booth is gonna deliver anyway?

33:01.765 --> 33:02.932
What makes you think

33:03.008 --> 33:05.217
one single city councilman

33:05.218 --> 33:08.254
has enough power to keep everybody
looking the other way?

33:08.831 --> 33:10.538
You have no idea
what you're messing with.

33:10.538 --> 33:12.010
Oh, is that right, Buchalter?

33:13.793 --> 33:16.145
Won't you get your ass over here
and help me cut him loose?

33:16.905 --> 33:17.896
I don't think so.

33:17.971 --> 33:19.088
Help me cut him loose!

33:19.089 --> 33:20.105
Or what ?

33:20.733 --> 33:21.893
You'll blow yourself up?

33:23.625 --> 33:25.031
You don't have the stones for it.

33:30.851 --> 33:31.812
Wanna bet?

33:39.386 --> 33:40.360
It's ringed!

33:43.794 --> 33:44.786
Move !

33:45.759 --> 33:47.015
Everyone freeze !

33:58.125 --> 33:59.380
It's about time you showed up.

33:59.754 --> 34:01.008
Next time, dial faster.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.536
So, I called Rita.

34:25.092 --> 34:26.074
Chad's there.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.835
So, she's safe.

34:29.183 --> 34:30.371
Thanks, Andrea.

34:32.521 --> 34:33.889
For everything.

34:37.244 --> 34:38.996
Hopper, I don't know
what this is all about.

34:38.996 --> 34:40.474
But I still got to do this.

34:40.658 --> 34:43.228
- You're under arrest for the murder...
- Yeah, I know.

34:45.719 --> 34:46.717
That's my cover.

34:46.985 --> 34:47.967
You sure ?

34:48.212 --> 34:49.510
You don't look so good.

34:50.271 --> 34:51.254
I got it.

35:06.456 --> 35:07.425
And I gotta...

35:09.134 --> 35:10.130
...thank you.

35:12.248 --> 35:14.380
You didn't have to save my ass
back there, but you did.

35:14.865 --> 35:16.383
And you'd still be free if you didn't.

35:21.247 --> 35:22.418
Why were you at that bar?

35:23.266 --> 35:24.451
I was following a lead.

35:25.213 --> 35:26.271
Lead from who ?

35:27.343 --> 35:28.326
From your sister.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.029
She mentioned those two guys.

35:30.030 --> 35:31.240
The ex-LA sheriffs.

35:31.904 --> 35:33.114
Fencik and Buchalter.

35:33.239 --> 35:34.555
She said there were framing you.

35:36.296 --> 35:37.409
And you believed her ?

35:37.410 --> 35:38.508
No, not at first.

35:38.677 --> 35:40.077
But then, your girldfriend came in,

35:40.349 --> 35:42.533
in a pretty passionate statement
vouching for you.

35:43.844 --> 35:45.156
She said some things that...

35:49.426 --> 35:50.406
Anyway...

35:51.551 --> 35:52.968
they really want the best for you.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.613
It's nice to know.

35:55.669 --> 35:56.639
Look, man.

35:56.708 --> 35:59.105
I work homicide,
okay ? I don't know anything about

35:59.468 --> 36:00.824
gangs or councilmen or...

36:01.185 --> 36:02.713
or whatever was going on in that bar...

36:02.714 --> 36:03.887
I didn't killed Garza.

36:11.561 --> 36:13.015
I just can't prove it yet.

36:15.686 --> 36:16.887
What would you need ?

36:26.384 --> 36:28.461
Mrs. Garza didn't want
to stay in the house.

36:28.515 --> 36:29.957
You can probably imagine.

36:31.115 --> 36:32.168
Walk me through.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.764
Obviously anything important
we bagged and tagged.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.564
Windows were closed.

36:38.601 --> 36:39.978
No signs of forced entry.

36:41.646 --> 36:42.682
The body was here.

36:43.290 --> 36:44.250
Three bullets.

36:44.251 --> 36:46.280
Two to the chest, one to the head.
Execution style.

36:46.467 --> 36:47.776
Gone through-and-throughs.

36:48.113 --> 36:50.342
Coroner pulled three clean slugs, 9 mm.

36:50.586 --> 36:51.549
Prints ?

36:51.566 --> 36:53.859
Yeah. Garza's, Mrs. Garza,
the clean lady.

36:53.860 --> 36:54.834
But not mine ?

36:57.100 --> 36:58.109
Not here.

36:58.190 --> 36:59.539
Don't you think it's a little funky

36:59.540 --> 37:02.917
that I would be careful enough
not to leave a single print here.

37:03.016 --> 37:04.595
But then hide the murder weapon

37:04.596 --> 37:05.562
with the prints

37:05.563 --> 37:06.579
In my own closet.

37:09.336 --> 37:11.341
Where does Mrs. Garza say she saw me?

37:11.342 --> 37:13.791
She said she heard commotion
from upstairs.

37:14.486 --> 37:16.045
She came of that door away.

37:17.542 --> 37:20.085
And you were standing
over her husband's body here,

37:20.086 --> 37:21.073
with a gun.

37:21.995 --> 37:22.978
So she ran.

37:26.017 --> 37:27.000
What about the safe?

37:28.017 --> 37:29.395
We opened it first thing.

37:30.417 --> 37:33.580
There wasn't anything in there,
it was cleaned up before LAPD showed up.

37:35.180 --> 37:36.516
Whatever Garza kept in here,

37:36.517 --> 37:37.505
he got rid of it.

37:38.771 --> 37:40.834
You called and left me a message
about this package.

37:40.835 --> 37:42.218
- He told me to call you.
- Who?

37:43.291 --> 37:46.305
When he brought me the packages,
they were both sealed.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.541
I think I know what was inside.

37:50.321 --> 37:52.427
Evidence from one
of my father's old cases.

37:52.427 --> 37:53.559
Garza sent it to me.

37:54.274 --> 37:55.507
That's why he was killed.

37:55.562 --> 37:56.899
Your dad's case ?

37:57.878 --> 38:00.495
And that's why you think
they're framing you ?

38:01.297 --> 38:02.388
One of the reasons.

38:03.007 --> 38:05.077
And this is connected somehow with...

38:05.203 --> 38:06.194
With that bar

38:06.601 --> 38:08.319
and the gangs, councilman Booth?

38:08.407 --> 38:10.877
Yes, the councilman
is behind Garza's murder.

38:10.923 --> 38:13.501
- So, we bust him!
- No, it won't be that easy.

38:13.502 --> 38:15.057
This doesn't end with Booth.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.197
Look on the bright side.

38:17.698 --> 38:19.429
With everything we got tonight,

38:19.593 --> 38:20.810
we're gonna get these guys.

38:21.569 --> 38:23.003
And by tomorrow, you're a free man.

38:25.841 --> 38:26.809
I hope so.

38:31.334 --> 38:32.307
What ?

38:38.826 --> 38:40.312
Somebody messed with this.

38:40.313 --> 38:41.475
What are you talking about?

38:41.476 --> 38:42.460
There was a fax here.

38:42.461 --> 38:44.413
I saw it this morning
before we photoed the room

38:44.414 --> 38:45.723
but it's not on the picture.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.691
Someone took it.

38:46.692 --> 38:50.128
I will check the machine,
see what time the last fax was sent.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.563
Last night.

38:55.586 --> 38:56.805
That's my home number.

38:56.958 --> 38:59.113
Wait. Garza faxed you last night ?

38:59.114 --> 39:01.756
He must have tried.
I don't have a fax at the house.

39:01.850 --> 39:03.475
Does this sort of fax has a memory ?

39:14.217 --> 39:15.572
Miguel Dominguez.

39:16.207 --> 39:18.199
Why would Garza send this to you?

39:19.701 --> 39:21.443
<i>That thing you asked about</i>

39:21.446 --> 39:23.326
<i>matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez.</i>

39:23.327 --> 39:24.681
<i>That Jane Doe case.</i>

39:24.972 --> 39:27.832
<i>Your dad already had a suspect,
this Dominguez guy.</i>

39:28.080 --> 39:30.310
<i>Trouble was, he was locked up
in Pelican Bay at the time.</i>

39:30.311 --> 39:31.481
<i>He is the Boogey Man.</i>

39:31.586 --> 39:32.595
<i>He's like Freddy.</i>

39:33.264 --> 39:34.601
<i>Kill you in your dreams.</i>

39:35.467 --> 39:37.176
He wanted me to find out.

39:37.888 --> 39:39.862
Looks like I'm going to Pelican Bay...
