00:21.215 --> 00:24.889
I think somebody just went over!

00:26.262 --> 00:27.461
Honey, be careful!

00:31.206 --> 00:32.595
Hey!

00:32.597 --> 00:35.107
Anybody in there?

00:40.067 --> 00:41.595
Oh, God.

00:46.764 --> 00:50.743
Hey, call 911! There's
a dead guy down here!

01:01.985 --> 01:04.367
What?

01:51.239 --> 01:52.740
I pulled some strings
with the local cops.

01:52.741 --> 01:54.375
If anyone asks, we're feds.

01:54.376 --> 01:55.442
Any special unit?

01:55.443 --> 01:56.677
Narcotics.

01:56.678 --> 01:58.311
Hold on a second, guys.

01:58.312 --> 01:59.779
Though I doubt drugs
has anything to do with

01:59.780 --> 02:01.580
what's in this body bag.

02:01.581 --> 02:02.648
Don't you mean who?

02:02.649 --> 02:04.316
Not so much.

02:04.317 --> 02:06.250
Oh, dear God.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.350
Yeah.

02:07.351 --> 02:09.752
That's all that's left
of one Thomas Rayburn.

02:09.752 --> 02:13.257
Sliced and diced.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.859
His wife's body was found over this way.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.240
The wound pattern's the
same as her husband's.

02:34.709 --> 02:36.243
The cuts are uneven,

02:36.244 --> 02:37.745
some deep, some superficial.

02:37.746 --> 02:38.979
The attack was fierce,

02:38.980 --> 02:40.346
frenzied.

02:40.347 --> 02:41.881
Yeah.

02:41.882 --> 02:43.216
Doesn't look like she had
much time to put up a fight.

02:43.217 --> 02:44.617
Do you think we could spin this

02:44.618 --> 02:46.219
as a wild animal attack?

02:46.220 --> 02:47.353
I don't know.

02:47.354 --> 02:48.521
There's no tracks around here,

02:48.522 --> 02:50.856
just footprints.

02:56.461 --> 02:57.995
Okay, so the way I figure it,

02:57.996 --> 02:59.863
husband and wife spot this wreck,

02:59.864 --> 03:01.634
husband goes to investigate,

03:01.635 --> 03:03.403
and when he doesn't come back,

03:03.404 --> 03:04.738
wife follows.

03:04.739 --> 03:06.840
It was her voice we
heard on the 911 call.

03:06.841 --> 03:08.842
She said her husband found a dead body.

03:08.843 --> 03:10.343
Now, judging from the blood spatter,

03:10.344 --> 03:12.478
I'm guessing major chest wound.

03:12.479 --> 03:13.680
Steering column probably punched

03:13.681 --> 03:14.814
right through the heart.

03:14.815 --> 03:15.981
Death would be instantaneous.

03:15.982 --> 03:17.716
Yeah.

03:17.717 --> 03:21.385
So then where's the body?

03:22.420 --> 03:24.421
Yeah, what's up, man?

03:24.422 --> 03:25.956
Hey, come on.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.924
You look like you've
seen a ghost, brother.

03:44.806 --> 03:46.373
Hey, did you get that link I emailed you

03:46.374 --> 03:48.708
of the security camera footage
of that parking lot in newcity?

03:48.709 --> 03:50.576
Yeah, I just finished watching it.

03:50.577 --> 03:52.410
Is the killer who I think it is?

03:52.411 --> 03:53.711
Well, Henry's facial
recognition software

03:53.712 --> 03:54.679
caught a hit,

03:54.680 --> 03:55.746
and I pulled a frame from the video.

03:57.048 --> 03:59.282
Huh....

03:59.283 --> 04:00.450
Chad Spencer,

04:00.451 --> 04:03.419
our missing car-crash victim.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.787
24 years old and
clearly very much alive.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.789
He's a trust-fund baby on
his fourth Ivy league tour.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.757
Ah...

04:09.758 --> 04:11.025
Who walks away from a crash like that?

04:11.026 --> 04:13.094
Actually, what am I saying?

04:13.095 --> 04:14.595
We know a lot of people

04:14.596 --> 04:15.929
who walk away from a crash like that.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.329
The question is,

04:17.331 --> 04:18.029
why hasn't he been in
touch with his family

04:18.031 --> 04:19.363
or any of his friends?

04:19.363 --> 04:20.964
He has.

04:20.964 --> 04:22.933
This is darrin Wilson, the
other guy in the footage.

04:22.934 --> 04:24.501
Reported missing two days ago.

04:24.502 --> 04:27.302
Darrin is Chad's roommate.

04:27.303 --> 04:29.637
From another wealthy family,

04:29.638 --> 04:30.771
and yet it's not a kidnapping scheme.

04:30.772 --> 04:31.905
There've been no ransom demands.

04:31.906 --> 04:33.473
Okay, so what've we got?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.741
We got a dead man,
walks away from a crash,

04:35.742 --> 04:37.042
becomes homicidal.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.310
Run the data again.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.378
There's obviously a common denominator

04:39.379 --> 04:40.545
we're overlooking.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.880
See if anyone else has disappeared.

04:42.881 --> 04:44.748
Yeah.

04:44.749 --> 04:46.182
Hey, you know,

04:46.183 --> 04:47.683
this would be a lot
easier with Henry's help.

04:47.684 --> 04:49.451
He's unavailable.

04:49.452 --> 04:51.720
Why, again?

04:51.721 --> 04:54.756
He's on a mission of utmost importance.

04:54.757 --> 04:55.990
I was sworn to absolute secrecy.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.858
Wait a second.

04:57.859 --> 04:59.492
San Diego comic-con?

04:59.493 --> 05:02.094
That's the mission of utmost importance?

05:02.095 --> 05:03.528
You did not hear it from me.

05:03.529 --> 05:04.962
Where's the big guy?

05:05.964 --> 05:07.165
He's with him?

05:07.166 --> 05:07.965
It's one of the few places

05:07.966 --> 05:09.600
he actually blends in.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.735
Okay, great, so they're fan boys.

05:11.736 --> 05:14.036
I'm working with fan boys...

05:25.448 --> 05:26.648
Darrin!

05:26.649 --> 05:27.950
What the hell?

05:27.951 --> 05:29.451
I got your text. Where have you been?

05:29.452 --> 05:31.154
Don't worry about it.

05:31.155 --> 05:32.488
It's all good.

05:32.489 --> 05:33.856
Your parents have been calling me.

05:33.857 --> 05:34.925
They're freaking out.

05:34.926 --> 05:36.126
I'm sure they have. Let's go.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.928
What are you doing?

05:37.929 --> 05:39.063
Take it easy.

05:39.064 --> 05:40.430
Shh...

05:40.431 --> 05:42.498
Darrin, this is not...

05:46.700 --> 05:47.800
Chad?

05:50.501 --> 05:52.568
Holy crap.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.502
Well, it's nice to see you, too, Laura.

05:54.503 --> 05:57.604
Okay, but I...

05:57.605 --> 05:59.072
I went to your memorial service.

05:59.073 --> 06:00.373
Yeah.

06:00.374 --> 06:01.641
It's a shame I had to miss it.

06:01.642 --> 06:04.076
I heard it was nice.

06:04.077 --> 06:05.978
Oh, it was beautiful, Buddy.

06:09.916 --> 06:12.117
Okay, you guys are
really freaking me out.

06:12.118 --> 06:13.485
Just relax.

06:13.486 --> 06:14.753
We're all friends here.

06:17.689 --> 06:19.723
What the hell's going on?

06:19.724 --> 06:20.957
That's what I wondered, too, at first,

06:20.958 --> 06:22.792
but then I remembered that week

06:22.793 --> 06:26.195
that we had spent at
that Mexican clinic.

06:26.196 --> 06:28.096
And?

06:28.097 --> 06:30.398
And...

06:30.399 --> 06:34.168
I'm just saying...

06:34.169 --> 06:37.671
Then it all made sense.

06:37.672 --> 06:38.838
Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

06:59.956 --> 07:00.956
Hi.

07:02.090 --> 07:03.857
Welcome to the club.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.633
Any luck so far?

07:15.634 --> 07:16.634
Just had a report of
another missing kid.

07:16.635 --> 07:18.069
And?

07:18.070 --> 07:19.437
That common denominator

07:19.438 --> 07:20.605
that Magnus was looking for...

07:20.606 --> 07:21.739
you found it?

07:21.740 --> 07:24.108
Well, out of sheer
desperation, I ran the names

07:24.109 --> 07:26.109
through the North American
security institute.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.612
You don't seriously
think they're terrorists?

07:28.613 --> 07:29.779
No, but check this out.

07:29.780 --> 07:32.215
The nasi also monitors

07:32.216 --> 07:33.883
customs and immigration,

07:33.884 --> 07:35.451
and it looks like all these missing kids

07:35.452 --> 07:37.152
recently spent time in Mexico.

07:37.153 --> 07:38.554
On vacation?

07:38.555 --> 07:40.088
Just the opposite.

07:40.089 --> 07:42.858
So they checked into a drug clinic,

07:42.859 --> 07:44.892
very expensive, very exclusive.

07:44.893 --> 07:46.494
Headed by the noted Viennese scientist

07:46.495 --> 07:48.062
doctor Heinrich Baumschlager.

07:48.063 --> 07:49.697
Never heard of him.

07:49.698 --> 07:52.198
Well, the place is called
la casa de la nueva vida.

07:52.199 --> 07:53.967
Ah, the house of new life,

07:53.968 --> 07:55.702
and it appears to be
living up to its name.

08:01.574 --> 08:03.908
I'll tell Dr. Baumschlager you're here.

08:03.909 --> 08:05.076
Thank you.

08:05.077 --> 08:07.178
Gracias.

08:13.684 --> 08:15.184
Plastic.

08:15.185 --> 08:16.252
Why do I get the feeling

08:16.253 --> 08:17.486
we're going to sit through

08:17.487 --> 08:18.554
a timeshare pitch?

08:18.555 --> 08:19.921
Because there's something a tad dodgy

08:19.922 --> 08:20.955
about all of this.

08:20.956 --> 08:22.155
Yeah, well,

08:22.156 --> 08:23.590
the crash forensics came up zilch.

08:23.591 --> 08:25.992
Right now we have nothing.

08:25.993 --> 08:28.227
None of this makes any sense.

08:31.565 --> 08:34.765
El doctor will see you now.

08:38.135 --> 08:39.270
On the contrary,

08:39.270 --> 08:41.638
now it makes perfect sense.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.642
Hola, amigos!

08:55.075 --> 08:57.209
And right over here,

08:57.210 --> 08:59.244
we have our friendship lanai.

08:59.245 --> 09:02.146
It's a small, intimate
space for sharing...

09:02.147 --> 09:04.347
Nikola, we're not here for the tour.

09:04.348 --> 09:05.582
I notice you do seem a bit on edge.

09:05.583 --> 09:06.683
Might I suggest

09:06.684 --> 09:10.119
one of our green-tea detox massages?

09:10.120 --> 09:11.620
It makes you feel 100 again.

09:11.621 --> 09:13.555
We know what's going on here.

09:13.556 --> 09:15.390
And I don't like the tone of your voice.

09:15.391 --> 09:17.492
And we don't like being lied to, so...

09:17.493 --> 09:19.260
Why are you people always so ready

09:19.261 --> 09:20.461
to think the worst of me?

09:20.462 --> 09:22.095
You've seen

09:22.096 --> 09:24.231
my facilities for yourself.

09:24.232 --> 09:25.699
You don't honestly expect us to believe

09:25.700 --> 09:27.267
that you are running a detox clinic?

09:27.268 --> 09:28.501
Yeah, you're, uh,

09:28.502 --> 09:31.271
you're not exactly
the philanthropic type.

09:31.272 --> 09:32.338
I never said I wasn't making a profit,

09:32.339 --> 09:33.406
but in return,

09:33.407 --> 09:35.408
I provide a public service.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.543
I'm waiting.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.810
Wealthy parents

09:38.811 --> 09:40.578
ship their drug-addled teenagers to me.

09:40.579 --> 09:41.679
They arrive,

09:41.680 --> 09:43.414
their poor little bodies wracked

09:43.415 --> 09:46.350
by the best designer
drugs trust funds can buy.

09:46.351 --> 09:47.518
It breaks your heart,

09:47.519 --> 09:50.320
but then after one week of my treatment,

09:50.321 --> 09:51.688
I send them home to mater and pater

09:51.689 --> 09:53.289
completely cured of all addictions.

09:53.290 --> 09:54.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa, one week?

09:54.458 --> 09:55.491
Mm-hm.

09:55.492 --> 09:56.859
That's impossible.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.727
Which part of "I'm a
genius" aren't you getting?

09:58.728 --> 10:01.062
Less ego, more facts, please.

10:01.063 --> 10:02.130
All right.

10:02.131 --> 10:04.599
Do you remember that weapon I invented

10:04.600 --> 10:06.501
to combat the cabal's super abnormals?

10:06.502 --> 10:07.535
Yes, all too well.

10:07.536 --> 10:09.036
This may go over your head.

10:09.037 --> 10:10.270
Just try to play along.

10:10.271 --> 10:12.338
Suffice it to say,

10:12.339 --> 10:13.673
I redesigned the biotechnology core,

10:13.674 --> 10:16.008
creating a blood matrix scrubber

10:16.009 --> 10:17.209
with selective protein inhibitors...

10:17.210 --> 10:18.243
enough!

10:18.244 --> 10:19.278
Whatever you've done

10:19.279 --> 10:20.512
to these young people, Nikola,

10:20.513 --> 10:21.379
they're disappearing.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.914
As in...

10:22.915 --> 10:26.028
Something's killing them
and stealing their bodies.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.650
You don't say.

10:29.119 --> 10:30.453
Come on, out with it.

10:31.621 --> 10:34.289
I want to hear you say the words.

10:36.091 --> 10:37.359
All right.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.328
I... I may have...

10:39.329 --> 10:40.529
sort of...

10:40.530 --> 10:42.564
Spill it, Nikola.

10:42.565 --> 10:44.733
Turned them into vampires.

11:14.624 --> 11:18.093
Amazing.

11:22.498 --> 11:25.133
Solid.

11:28.303 --> 11:32.172
Admittedly, I was too impatient
with my previous experiments.

11:32.173 --> 11:34.406
They were... imperfect.

11:34.407 --> 11:35.674
They were homicidal.

11:35.675 --> 11:37.242
Semantics.

11:37.243 --> 11:38.543
This time it's different.

11:38.544 --> 11:39.744
How?

11:39.745 --> 11:41.812
You would still have had
to use your own blood.

11:41.813 --> 11:43.714
Yes, but I programmed
the little tykes' DNA

11:43.715 --> 11:45.748
for a time release
of the vampire gene...

11:45.749 --> 11:48.317
30 years minimum for the
metamorphosis to complete.

11:48.318 --> 11:49.752
Time rease?

11:49.753 --> 11:51.420
We're talking about
ancient vampire blood here.

11:51.421 --> 11:52.522
It's not cold medication.

11:52.523 --> 11:54.057
Same principle, junior.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.559
I thought

11:55.560 --> 11:57.293
that if I slowed down
the genetic mutation,

11:57.294 --> 11:59.296
I'd sidestep the antibody rejection

11:59.297 --> 12:01.130
which was plaguing my former subjects.

12:01.131 --> 12:02.498
Well, clearly, something went wrong.

12:02.499 --> 12:04.233
Clearly.

12:04.234 --> 12:08.270
How many subjects did you treat here?

12:08.271 --> 12:10.505
Oh, man...

12:10.506 --> 12:12.640
Enough to raise a little hell.

12:29.654 --> 12:31.687
I can smell your blood.

12:31.688 --> 12:34.656
You want to taste me?

12:38.693 --> 12:40.794
Yummy...

12:40.795 --> 12:42.228
Chad!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.263
You gotta see this, man.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.165
Yeah, um...

12:46.166 --> 12:47.633
Now is... now is not a good time.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.201
Would you hear me out, please?

12:50.202 --> 12:51.536
.. So, listen, I hired
this hacker to break through

12:51.537 --> 12:53.204
Dr. Frankenstein's firewalls, right,

12:53.205 --> 12:55.573
and most of what we found
were medical journals,

12:55.574 --> 12:58.142
records of his experiments,
that kind of stuff,

12:58.143 --> 13:00.477
but then I also found this.

13:00.478 --> 13:01.712
What is it?

13:03.548 --> 13:06.516
It's a history of vampires, Laura,

13:06.517 --> 13:07.984
but nothing like I've ever heard before.

13:07.985 --> 13:09.385
What does it say?

13:09.386 --> 13:12.654
"Vampires were once the
best and brightest race

13:12.655 --> 13:15.156
on the planet.

13:15.157 --> 13:16.758
So many of the great minds

13:16.759 --> 13:18.793
were bloodsuckers."

13:18.794 --> 13:21.695
The humans bowed down to us?

13:23.898 --> 13:26.132
We were immortals?

13:29.869 --> 13:31.336
Kings.

13:31.337 --> 13:32.571
King of the world.

13:32.572 --> 13:34.572
I like the sound of that.

13:34.573 --> 13:37.341
Yeah.

13:37.342 --> 13:38.843
So do i.

13:41.246 --> 13:44.314
I think it's time to rebuild the empire.

13:52.388 --> 13:54.489
I don't know. I don't get it.

13:54.490 --> 13:55.723
I adhered to all the protocols.

13:55.724 --> 13:57.425
Have a look for yourself.

13:57.426 --> 13:58.626
And yet the incubation period

13:58.627 --> 14:00.962
was drastically truncated.

14:03.631 --> 14:05.430
Instant vampires.

14:05.431 --> 14:06.931
So maybe there's some sort
of environmental variable

14:06.932 --> 14:08.332
I didn't take into account.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.400
What, like weather,

14:09.401 --> 14:10.601
or diet, lifestyle?

14:10.602 --> 14:11.835
Death.

14:11.836 --> 14:13.603
Death?

14:13.604 --> 14:15.638
Death would be the last thing

14:15.639 --> 14:17.373
that an immortal would think of.

14:17.374 --> 14:18.608
This first kid died in a car accident.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.242
And then showed up
two days later, alive.

14:20.243 --> 14:21.376
Chad Spencer.

14:21.377 --> 14:23.278
Yes, I remember him. Alpha-male type.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.847
If a human, having undergone
your treatment, dies...

14:25.848 --> 14:28.282
the vampire gene would kick in.

14:28.283 --> 14:30.684
It was programmed to survive

14:30.685 --> 14:31.952
at all costs.

14:31.953 --> 14:33.253
Okay, so Chad comes back to life

14:33.254 --> 14:34.287
and starts rounding
up the other patients.

14:34.288 --> 14:36.222
And killing them,

14:36.223 --> 14:37.890
thereby triggering
their vampire genetics.

14:39.325 --> 14:40.492
The little bastard.

14:40.493 --> 14:43.428
This was supposed to be my party!

14:43.429 --> 14:46.530
Nobody hijacks Nikola Tesla!

14:52.703 --> 14:56.940
You guys must be high.

14:56.941 --> 14:58.608
Are you using again?

14:58.609 --> 15:00.677
We are clean, my friend.

15:00.678 --> 15:02.779
What's with the eyes?

15:02.780 --> 15:04.681
They don't do that on true blood.

15:04.682 --> 15:06.716
Look, this isn't a tv show, okay?

15:06.717 --> 15:07.783
This is real.

15:07.784 --> 15:09.452
So, what do you think?

15:09.453 --> 15:12.287
Are you in?

15:12.288 --> 15:15.389
I don't know.

15:15.390 --> 15:17.457
I mean, I didn't get to do
spring break at the clinic

15:17.458 --> 15:19.225
like you guys did.

15:19.226 --> 15:20.493
Well, now's your chance.

15:20.494 --> 15:22.662
Be part of the group.

15:22.663 --> 15:23.930
That is, of course, if you're up for it.

15:23.931 --> 15:25.865
Immortality?

15:25.866 --> 15:27.500
Yeah.

15:27.501 --> 15:28.767
You're serious?

15:28.768 --> 15:31.236
Oh, I'm very serious...

15:31.237 --> 15:33.338
But you better be sure about it,

15:33.339 --> 15:35.940
because there's no going back.

15:40.743 --> 15:41.910
What do I need to do?

15:47.682 --> 15:49.049
You just leave everything

15:49.050 --> 15:51.351
to me.

15:53.287 --> 15:54.821
Whoa.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.328
What's going on?

16:04.329 --> 16:08.630
Why isn't he coming back to life?

16:08.631 --> 16:10.330
Wow. Not cool.

16:10.331 --> 16:11.430
Oh, my God.

16:11.431 --> 16:13.631
I... I killed him.

16:13.632 --> 16:14.831
Look, what the hell happened?

16:14.832 --> 16:16.533
No, I mean, I really killed him.

16:16.534 --> 16:17.801
Look, it's not your fault, okay?

16:17.802 --> 16:19.236
What do you mean it's not my fault?

16:19.237 --> 16:20.970
I bit him on the neck and now he's dead!

16:20.971 --> 16:22.338
Well, it's not supposed
to happen like this.

16:22.339 --> 16:23.372
I don't get it.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.540
I mean, everyone knows

16:24.541 --> 16:27.543
that's how you make more vampires.

16:27.544 --> 16:28.678
Yeah, well, clearly they're wrong.

16:28.679 --> 16:29.980
Clearly, Chad.

16:29.981 --> 16:31.781
You know, for the superior race,

16:31.782 --> 16:33.083
we're not doing so hot.

16:33.084 --> 16:34.584
Okay, so, what do you want to do now?

16:34.585 --> 16:37.019
Look, this is... this is ridiculous.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.987
Why are we trying to
figure this out on our own?

16:38.988 --> 16:40.889
We know exactly who did this to us.

16:40.890 --> 16:42.624
That doctor in Mexico.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.025
Yeah.

16:44.026 --> 16:46.594
That's exactly where we're
going to find the answers.

16:46.595 --> 16:48.762
Yeah, Chad, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling about all this.

16:48.763 --> 16:50.831
What, are you going to bail
just because of one screw-up?

16:50.832 --> 16:51.931
That's what you call dead Steve?

16:51.932 --> 16:54.534
Look, come on, man, okay?

16:54.535 --> 16:58.571
That quack down south did this to us,

16:58.572 --> 17:01.807
but we have a chance now
to take our power back.

17:01.808 --> 17:04.409
If we nail this...

17:04.410 --> 17:06.911
There isn't anybody on earth
that can push us around anymore.

17:09.948 --> 17:12.583
Okay...

17:12.584 --> 17:13.650
We're good.

17:13.651 --> 17:15.518
What about you?

17:15.519 --> 17:18.788
You going to be okay?

17:18.789 --> 17:19.954
I've never killed anything

17:19.955 --> 17:21.089
in my life,

17:21.089 --> 17:24.392
so how can I feel so sad,

17:24.393 --> 17:28.061
and at the same time, so...

17:28.063 --> 17:29.330
Hungry?

17:34.935 --> 17:37.036
We are what we are.

17:43.509 --> 17:45.043
Hey there.

17:45.044 --> 17:47.578
How are things in the land
of the 65-cent Margarita?

17:47.579 --> 17:50.013
Well, the phrase "bloody
awful" comes to mind.

17:50.014 --> 17:51.148
We're on our way back.

17:51.149 --> 17:52.415
In the meantime,

17:52.416 --> 17:53.617
I've emailed you a list of patients

17:53.618 --> 17:54.784
who spent time at the clinic.

17:54.785 --> 17:56.018
Find out all you can about them.

17:56.019 --> 17:57.285
Okay.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.786
Am I looking for anything in particular?

17:58.787 --> 17:59.854
Vampires.

17:59.855 --> 18:00.921
Come again?

18:00.922 --> 18:01.989
Yeah, it seems Nikola's

18:01.990 --> 18:03.826
been up to his usual selfish tricks.

18:03.827 --> 18:05.761
Oh. Oh, I'm selfish?

18:05.762 --> 18:06.895
Shocking, I know.

18:06.896 --> 18:08.430
Because I tried to save my race

18:08.431 --> 18:09.731
from extinction?

18:09.732 --> 18:11.099
Because you used innocent children

18:11.100 --> 18:13.101
in a potentially deadly experiment.

18:13.102 --> 18:14.402
There was that.

18:14.403 --> 18:15.803
Professional jealousy.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.505
You've no idea what you've unleashed!

18:18.506 --> 18:20.073
Ah, let me guess.

18:20.074 --> 18:22.142
This must be your graduating class.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.877
Incredible...

18:24.878 --> 18:26.144
it worked.

18:26.145 --> 18:28.913
You're coming with us.

18:30.616 --> 18:33.684
But you didn't even say please.

18:39.824 --> 18:41.457
Nikola, what the hell are you doing?

18:49.566 --> 18:51.132
Crude, yet magnificent.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.845
Dammit!

19:17.042 --> 19:19.577
It's an honor to welcome
the source of our greatness.

19:19.578 --> 19:21.712
You're like our own personal Obama.

19:21.713 --> 19:23.547
What the hell are you playing at?

19:23.548 --> 19:24.615
Look, this isn't a game, okay?

19:24.616 --> 19:25.716
We both know that.

19:25.717 --> 19:27.651
Don't read me the rule book, Sonny.

19:27.652 --> 19:28.886
I wrote it.

19:28.887 --> 19:30.721
What's your problem?

19:30.722 --> 19:31.856
This was your idea, remember?

19:31.857 --> 19:33.157
No, no, no.

19:33.158 --> 19:35.959
The spontaneous generation of vampires

19:35.960 --> 19:38.628
decades ahead of
schedule was not my idea.

19:38.629 --> 19:39.696
I had a plan,

19:39.697 --> 19:42.064
an intricate, ingenious design,

19:42.065 --> 19:43.532
and, strange as it may sound,

19:43.533 --> 19:44.966
it did not involve you
blowing away your friends

19:44.967 --> 19:46.101
and taking over.

19:48.470 --> 19:51.703
Do you have any idea what you've become?

19:51.704 --> 19:53.003
Well, that's why you're here,

19:53.004 --> 19:54.404
to fill in the gaps for us.

19:54.405 --> 19:56.705
Sanguine vampirus.

19:56.706 --> 19:59.074
The preeminent race on the planet.

19:59.075 --> 20:00.809
Born for greatness,

20:00.810 --> 20:02.679
bred to rule.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.483
Kings and pharaohs.

20:05.484 --> 20:08.920
There was a time when we sighed,

20:08.921 --> 20:11.021
and the world trembled.

20:11.022 --> 20:12.554
We know.

20:12.555 --> 20:13.821
We read your journal.

20:13.822 --> 20:15.721
Look, let's just cut to the Chase, okay?

20:15.722 --> 20:16.921
You chose us not because of who we are,

20:16.922 --> 20:17.954
but because of who we'll become.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.323
How astute.

20:20.324 --> 20:23.058
Our parents have more money than God,

20:23.059 --> 20:25.327
and they hold positions
of power and influence

20:25.328 --> 20:26.928
all over this world.

20:26.929 --> 20:28.129
And in a few decades time,

20:28.130 --> 20:28.996
you would have stepped into their shoes,

20:28.997 --> 20:30.097
creating a new ruling class,

20:30.098 --> 20:32.833
returning us to the old ways.

20:32.834 --> 20:33.967
So let's bring it on.

20:33.968 --> 20:35.902
Now,

20:35.903 --> 20:38.471
and if anyone stands in our way,

20:38.472 --> 20:40.540
they'll die.

20:40.541 --> 20:41.908
Nice.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.843
All the subtlety of brain
surgery with a chainsaw.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.810
But why wait?

20:47.811 --> 20:49.412
We're here right now.

20:49.413 --> 20:50.446
Oh, and you think

20:50.447 --> 20:51.681
that your 24 years' experience

20:51.682 --> 20:53.449
has prepped you for ruling the earth?

20:53.450 --> 20:54.683
What are you saying?

20:54.684 --> 20:56.151
I'm saying you'll blow it.

20:56.152 --> 20:57.385
You've turned what was
supposed to be a symphony

20:57.386 --> 20:59.454
into rock and roll!

20:59.455 --> 21:01.756
French-canadian rock and roll.

21:04.426 --> 21:05.826
You know, I was hoping

21:05.827 --> 21:07.594
you'd be a little bit more cooperative.

21:07.595 --> 21:11.097
Yeah, well, life's a bitch,
and then you don't die.

21:14.767 --> 21:16.067
Oh, what, we're going
to do this old-school?

21:16.068 --> 21:17.168
Is that it?

21:17.169 --> 21:18.769
You're not facing Magnus.

21:18.770 --> 21:19.870
This is me.

21:21.439 --> 21:23.674
Bring it on, kiddies.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.517
I hate them.

21:33.518 --> 21:34.984
I hate them...

21:48.095 --> 21:50.730
Okay...

21:50.731 --> 21:53.233
Let's talk.

21:53.234 --> 21:57.593
You know, I most broke a naI on.

21:57.594 --> 21:59.056
Should counteract let's talk.

21:59.057 --> 22:00.991
The sedative we gave
her during transport.

22:00.992 --> 22:02.526
Yeah, just tell me

22:02.527 --> 22:03.694
the straps are going to hold.

22:03.695 --> 22:06.530
Titanium webbing, vampire-proof.

22:08.799 --> 22:12.634
Hmm, rise and shine.

22:16.070 --> 22:18.137
Where am I?

22:18.138 --> 22:19.639
I'll be asking the questions now.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.841
And who the hell are you?

22:21.842 --> 22:25.711
Where have your friends taken Nikola?

22:25.712 --> 22:26.912
Dr. Baumschlager?

22:28.647 --> 22:30.014
Wouldn't you like to know?

22:30.015 --> 22:31.749
I don't have time to play games.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.850
You know, Chad's not going to be cool

22:32.851 --> 22:34.084
with this.

22:34.085 --> 22:35.886
If he finds out where you're holding me,

22:35.887 --> 22:37.153
he's going to whip
some serious vamp action

22:37.154 --> 22:39.421
on your ass.

22:39.422 --> 22:42.124
You have no idea what you've become.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.558
Insolence will only make things worse.

22:43.559 --> 22:44.559
Yeah?

22:44.560 --> 22:45.660
Why don't you bite me, bitch?

22:45.661 --> 22:48.128
Why don't you go get an earl grey

22:48.129 --> 22:51.064
and let me take a shot?

22:57.637 --> 23:00.472
Hey, cute boy.

23:03.575 --> 23:05.943
Ow!

23:05.944 --> 23:07.010
This is unconscionable,

23:07.011 --> 23:08.811
even by my standards.

23:08.812 --> 23:10.445
Yeah, well,

23:10.446 --> 23:12.946
I wanted to do it the easy way,

23:12.947 --> 23:14.881
but you forced my hand.

23:14.882 --> 23:15.748
So you steal my equipment,

23:15.749 --> 23:18.116
my research, my blood?

23:18.117 --> 23:19.551
Hey, biff!

23:19.552 --> 23:20.852
Darrin.

23:20.853 --> 23:22.819
Whatever.

23:22.820 --> 23:24.120
Take it easy with the
centrifuge, please.

23:24.121 --> 23:25.221
It's not a toy.

23:25.222 --> 23:26.689
I'm just following your notes.

23:26.690 --> 23:27.955
It's not paint by numbers.

23:27.956 --> 23:29.790
It's a highly sophisticated

23:29.791 --> 23:31.490
biochemical process.

23:31.491 --> 23:32.524
Huh.

23:32.525 --> 23:33.658
Does this chump even know

23:33.659 --> 23:34.960
what he's doing?

23:34.961 --> 23:36.227
Well, looking through your data,

23:36.228 --> 23:37.962
I saw that you were able to create

23:37.963 --> 23:39.830
a single strand of recombinant DNA

23:39.831 --> 23:41.998
based on your vampiric genetic pattern,

23:41.999 --> 23:44.066
then using a restriction endonuclease,

23:44.067 --> 23:45.634
you were able to cleave the DNA strands

23:45.635 --> 23:47.736
onto chromosomes number four,
seven, and eight sequentially,

23:47.737 --> 23:49.538
then reintroduced this third strand

23:49.539 --> 23:50.806
back to the separated
double-helix matrix

23:50.807 --> 23:52.007
and spliced it in,

23:52.008 --> 23:53.042
which, of course, ultimately created

23:53.043 --> 23:55.644
a stronger, super-triple DNA helix

23:55.645 --> 23:57.613
within these chromosomes.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.082
Um...

24:00.083 --> 24:02.050
Darrin was pre-med.

24:02.051 --> 24:03.951
Was?

24:03.952 --> 24:05.619
Dropped out.

24:05.620 --> 24:06.954
Why?

24:08.691 --> 24:10.692
I don't know, the parties were lame?

24:16.269 --> 24:17.769
Look, Laura,

24:17.770 --> 24:19.103
you know that we're only
trying to help you, right?

24:19.104 --> 24:20.571
Mmm,

24:20.572 --> 24:25.040
blah, blah, blah...

24:25.041 --> 24:27.008
Who's your cute little friend

24:27.009 --> 24:29.043
in the thrift-store wardrobe?

24:29.044 --> 24:30.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:30.712 --> 24:32.880
We're cool, right?

24:35.583 --> 24:37.249
Right?

24:37.250 --> 24:38.617
I mean, look, I get it.

24:38.618 --> 24:40.184
You were brought to that
clinic under false pretences,

24:40.185 --> 24:41.585
and you were experimented
on without your consent...

24:41.586 --> 24:43.923
I checked in a meth-head.

24:43.924 --> 24:45.591
I checked out a vampire.

24:45.592 --> 24:46.658
Bonus.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.026
Look, if you tell us

24:48.027 --> 24:49.294
where the others have taken Tesla,

24:49.295 --> 24:50.762
we might be able to reverse the process.

24:50.763 --> 24:52.797
That's your pitch?

24:52.798 --> 24:53.864
Yeah.

24:53.865 --> 24:55.132
Rat out up my friends,

24:55.133 --> 24:56.132
I get to go back to being an addict?

24:59.737 --> 25:02.104
I'm not telling you anything,

25:02.105 --> 25:04.907
and you can't make me.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.143
Okay.

25:08.144 --> 25:11.045
Well, have it your way.

25:11.046 --> 25:12.913
Kill her.

25:12.914 --> 25:14.181
About time.

25:15.517 --> 25:17.084
What are you going to do, shoot me?

25:17.085 --> 25:18.318
I'll just heal again.

25:18.319 --> 25:19.619
I'm immortal.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.088
If this gun was loaded

25:23.089 --> 25:25.723
with regular bullets,

25:25.724 --> 25:27.691
you'd be right,

25:27.692 --> 25:28.959
but these, sweetheart,

25:28.960 --> 25:30.627
are solid silver,

25:30.628 --> 25:31.862
blessed by a priest

25:31.863 --> 25:33.263
with holy water from the Vatican.

25:33.264 --> 25:35.798
Yeah, only us sanctified

25:35.799 --> 25:37.799
monster hunters get 'em. It's...

25:39.569 --> 25:41.169
I pump just one of these babies

25:41.170 --> 25:42.637
into your heart...

25:42.638 --> 25:43.671
And wham!

25:57.094 --> 25:58.927
We found out where
they're holding Tesla.

25:58.928 --> 26:00.195
Oh, good.

26:00.196 --> 26:01.829
So the psychological approach worked?

26:01.830 --> 26:03.230
I had my doubts.

26:03.231 --> 26:05.932
But, hey, result.

26:05.933 --> 26:07.300
Yeah.

26:07.301 --> 26:08.701
Uh, did you find anything interesting

26:08.702 --> 26:09.903
in Laura's blood?

26:09.904 --> 26:11.971
Perhaps.

26:11.972 --> 26:14.974
Her mutated DNA shows a triple helix.

26:14.975 --> 26:16.109
Translation, please?

26:16.110 --> 26:17.110
Well, if I can find a way

26:17.111 --> 26:18.210
to break the peptide Bond,

26:18.211 --> 26:19.878
I might be able to
detach the third strand

26:19.879 --> 26:21.213
and undo Nikola's handiwork.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.714
Tesla said he used the biotech

26:22.715 --> 26:24.382
developed for the super abnormal weapon.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.883
You think we can adapt it in some way?

26:25.884 --> 26:27.885
Without Nikola's research,
I'd be flying blind.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.753
We can't take that risk.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.021
But you may be able
to reverse the process.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.389
"May" being the operative word.

26:33.390 --> 26:35.191
Nikola's really done it this time.

26:35.192 --> 26:37.259
His creations are better, stronger,

26:37.260 --> 26:39.194
even deadlier than he is.

26:39.195 --> 26:41.796
Conventional means of control
are no longer sufficient.

26:41.797 --> 26:44.732
What if we can't put the
genie back in the bottle?

26:44.733 --> 26:46.400
These people know what they are,

26:46.401 --> 26:47.668
and now they have Nikola.

26:47.669 --> 26:48.969
Wait, you think

26:48.970 --> 26:50.270
they're going to start
pumping out vampires?

26:50.271 --> 26:52.305
I do,

26:52.306 --> 26:54.307
and unless we find a way
to stop them immediately,

26:54.308 --> 26:56.709
we could be looking
at a full resurrection

26:56.710 --> 26:58.043
of the deadliest race of abnormals

26:58.044 --> 26:59.277
ever to roam the earth.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.308
I know how Nikola thinks.

27:14.309 --> 27:15.876
He would never create something

27:15.877 --> 27:17.110
that he couldn't destroy,

27:17.111 --> 27:17.977
or at the very least, control.

27:17.978 --> 27:18.978
So you're saying

27:18.979 --> 27:20.379
there's a failsafe somewhere?

27:20.380 --> 27:22.314
Like a kill-switch
that'll un-vamp the vamps?

27:22.315 --> 27:23.648
It makes sense.

27:23.649 --> 27:24.849
He'd never let his work get compromised.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.050
Right, but what is it?

27:26.051 --> 27:27.151
And where is it?

27:27.152 --> 27:29.520
Didn't Tesla say

27:29.521 --> 27:30.520
the timeline for the vampires

27:30.521 --> 27:31.821
was, like, 30 years or something?

27:31.822 --> 27:33.623
So he'd have to have hidden it somewhere

27:33.624 --> 27:35.291
that he could be certain
would still be around then.

27:35.292 --> 27:37.259
Right, someplace solid, secure,

27:37.260 --> 27:38.927
like a... a bank.

27:38.928 --> 27:40.428
Or a vault.

27:40.429 --> 27:42.630
A sanctuary.

27:46.367 --> 27:47.967
Dammit, that was the last borges,

27:47.968 --> 27:49.301
and I was positive.

27:49.302 --> 27:52.104
Nikola so loves Jorge's
"a new refutation of time."

27:52.105 --> 27:54.973
Hey, what about trollope?

27:54.974 --> 27:56.307
No, it's not his taste.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.242
Try Whitman.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.410
He went through a free-verse phase

27:59.411 --> 28:00.845
for a while.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.914
So that's Curie,
Einstein, and Hawking down.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.115
Nothing?

28:05.116 --> 28:06.215
No. No hollowed-out compartments,

28:06.216 --> 28:08.350
no hidden failsafe schematics,

28:08.351 --> 28:10.419
just a bunch of wine stains

28:10.420 --> 28:13.288
on the first editions.

28:13.289 --> 28:15.556
Looks like fang-boy's a real slob.

28:17.959 --> 28:19.893
Hey!

28:30.436 --> 28:31.936
Not to be a Debbie Downer,

28:31.937 --> 28:33.937
but isn't this one hell of a long shot?

28:33.938 --> 28:35.939
And the alternative?

28:35.940 --> 28:37.073
I don't know.

28:37.074 --> 28:38.174
Exactly. Keep looking.

28:39.910 --> 28:41.043
Hey...

28:41.044 --> 28:43.178
Over here.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.913
What did you find?

28:44.914 --> 28:46.414
It's what I didn't find.

28:46.415 --> 28:47.981
Dust.

28:47.982 --> 28:49.015
Squeaky clean.

28:50.518 --> 28:52.084
The '45 Bordeaux.

28:52.085 --> 28:53.152
Bastard.

28:53.153 --> 28:54.721
That was a gift from Winston.

28:54.722 --> 28:56.156
Churchill.

28:57.191 --> 28:58.924
D-day.

28:58.925 --> 29:00.326
Long story.

29:01.628 --> 29:03.095
Either that's

29:03.096 --> 29:04.462
a lot of sediment, or...

29:10.502 --> 29:11.568
Yeah, baby.

29:13.204 --> 29:14.437
Great.

29:14.438 --> 29:15.605
What is it?

29:15.606 --> 29:17.707
Must be some kind of weapon,

29:17.708 --> 29:18.941
knowing Nikola.

29:18.942 --> 29:20.542
So how do we figure out how to use it?

29:20.543 --> 29:21.643
Well, that's quite simple.

29:21.644 --> 29:25.580
We ask the inventor.

29:30.686 --> 29:31.886
Look, I know that you're pissed

29:31.887 --> 29:34.389
that we messed up your plan,

29:34.390 --> 29:35.957
but you gotta give us

29:35.958 --> 29:39.528
some credit.

29:39.529 --> 29:40.796
You know, thanks to what we've learned

29:40.797 --> 29:41.630
from your blood sample,

29:41.631 --> 29:43.366
it, uh...

29:43.367 --> 29:44.867
Well, it looks like
we've cracked the code.

29:44.868 --> 29:48.137
Well, forgive me if I don't applaud.

29:48.138 --> 29:49.972
You know, by duplicating
your experiment,

29:49.973 --> 29:51.908
I could turn anyone I want

29:51.909 --> 29:53.709
into a vampire.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.578
Unstoppable army, anyone?

29:55.579 --> 29:56.813
God help us all.

29:56.814 --> 29:59.415
I don't get you.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.651
Isn't this what you wanted,

30:01.652 --> 30:03.419
the preeminent race reborn?

30:03.420 --> 30:04.587
On my terms, not yours.

30:04.588 --> 30:07.023
See, kid, you've stolen my life's work,

30:07.024 --> 30:08.925
and you've destroyed my dream,

30:08.926 --> 30:12.161
but really, what's worse than
all that, you little punk,

30:12.162 --> 30:14.597
is the arrogance to presume

30:14.598 --> 30:16.766
that you even have a
clue what you're doing.

30:16.767 --> 30:18.701
You still don't get it, huh, gramps?

30:18.702 --> 30:20.502
Mm-mm.

30:20.503 --> 30:22.170
We are your dream.

30:22.171 --> 30:24.839
No, you're my nightmare.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.409
You know, I really wanted
us to work together.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.978
I did.

30:29.979 --> 30:32.180
You'd be my mentor,

30:32.181 --> 30:34.884
teach us the ways of the race,

30:34.885 --> 30:36.720
but all you want to
do is bitch and moan.

30:36.721 --> 30:40.690
You know, you're just like my dad,

30:40.691 --> 30:45.029
my coaches, and my profs.

30:45.030 --> 30:47.064
There's no sense of possibility.

30:48.566 --> 30:49.733
You know, you may be immortal,

30:49.734 --> 30:52.201
but you died a long time ago.

30:52.202 --> 30:54.470
Do you have any idea who
you're talking to here, huh?

30:54.471 --> 30:55.571
Oh, right, the uh...

30:55.572 --> 30:58.942
The king of vampires.

30:58.943 --> 31:02.012
You're nothing but a
giant pain in the ass.

31:07.750 --> 31:10.618
I'll see you next century.

31:12.521 --> 31:13.621
What do you want?

31:18.694 --> 31:19.994
I mean, clearly,

31:19.995 --> 31:22.497
you're the man with the plan, so...

31:25.700 --> 31:28.602
You call this a plan?

31:28.603 --> 31:29.836
Whatever happened to

31:29.837 --> 31:31.238
the good old stake through the heart?

31:31.239 --> 31:32.572
Doesn't work.

31:32.573 --> 31:33.640
What about all those movies

31:33.641 --> 31:34.708
like Buffy...

31:34.709 --> 31:37.010
misinformation propaganda

31:37.011 --> 31:38.679
spread by the vampires themselves...

31:38.680 --> 31:40.847
confuse the enemy, preserve the race.

31:40.848 --> 31:43.115
What about exposing them
to sunlight or garlic...

31:43.116 --> 31:44.182
all you get is tanned vampires

31:44.183 --> 31:45.516
with bad breath.

31:45.517 --> 31:46.751
Besides, we don't want to kill them.

31:46.752 --> 31:47.818
We want to help them.

31:49.587 --> 31:50.721
No, I'm thinking kill them.

31:50.722 --> 31:52.656
Yeah. Trust-fund vampires?

31:52.657 --> 31:54.691
I'm thinking she's right.

31:54.692 --> 31:56.058
Granted, but it wasn't their choice.

31:56.059 --> 31:58.727
They may be rich,
spoiled, insolent children,

31:58.728 --> 32:00.862
but that doesn't mean
we shouldn't save them.

32:02.931 --> 32:04.665
That's a terrible sales pitch.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.933
Yeah.

32:07.834 --> 32:10.869
So it's just us against
a bunch of badass

32:10.870 --> 32:13.137
blood-sucking immortals, huh?

32:13.138 --> 32:15.572
Well, it's a good thing

32:15.573 --> 32:16.906
we have our magic glass stick

32:16.907 --> 32:18.174
that we don't know how to use.

32:18.175 --> 32:19.809
Otherwise, I would be worried.

32:22.079 --> 32:23.746
All right.

32:32.521 --> 32:35.557
You ever done this move before?

32:35.558 --> 32:36.724
Are you kidding?

32:36.725 --> 32:38.526
I invented it.

33:32.802 --> 33:33.901
Bram stoker?

33:33.902 --> 33:37.767
Alcoholic Irish hack.

33:37.768 --> 33:38.830
Helen...

33:38.831 --> 33:45.680
Nikola.

33:45.681 --> 33:48.477
Look what we found.

33:48.478 --> 33:50.144
Well, well, well, the
appetizers have arrived.

33:50.145 --> 33:52.779
Well, this is the last
time I come to your rescue.

33:52.780 --> 33:57.714
I'm sorry to say that's true.

33:57.715 --> 34:00.682
And no feeding until I say.

34:08.215 --> 34:11.728
Good to be king again.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.561
If we ever get out of this alive,

34:24.562 --> 34:25.661
I'll kill him.

34:25.663 --> 34:26.629
Me first.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.696
Both of you, back of the line.

34:29.297 --> 34:32.132
Well, it's about time!

34:32.132 --> 34:33.132
Before you thank me...

34:33.132 --> 34:34.199
thank you?

34:34.201 --> 34:35.300
You're welcome.

34:35.301 --> 34:36.572
I just saved all of your lives.

34:36.572 --> 34:38.476
Really? You expect us to believe that?

34:38.476 --> 34:39.877
What, you didn't believe

34:39.878 --> 34:41.210
that little display out there, did you?

34:41.212 --> 34:42.520
No, that was just melodrama
for the peanut gallery.

34:42.521 --> 34:45.533
Well, then, let's end
this stupidity right now.

34:45.534 --> 34:46.634
Yeah, untie us.

34:46.635 --> 34:49.735
What is it with kids these days?

34:51.271 --> 34:53.170
All right, where is it?

34:53.172 --> 34:54.572
My failsafe?

34:54.572 --> 34:56.273
The '45 Bordeaux,
tell me you brought it.

34:56.274 --> 34:58.608
You were taking an awful chance
that we'd actually find it.

34:58.609 --> 34:59.875
Yes, but, Helen,

34:59.876 --> 35:01.743
we've known each other
for 100-plus years.

35:01.744 --> 35:03.390
I think I know your mind by now.

35:05.328 --> 35:06.664
Left side.

35:09.738 --> 35:13.143
I've often wondered what
this moment would be like.

35:13.144 --> 35:14.413
Me...

35:14.414 --> 35:16.182
You tied up.

35:16.183 --> 35:18.386
It's a shame you brought the children.

35:18.387 --> 35:19.721
Focus, Nikola.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.873
Ah...

35:25.874 --> 35:27.746
Okay, so what is that thing?

35:27.747 --> 35:28.881
I call it...

35:28.882 --> 35:30.149
The de-vamper!

35:30.150 --> 35:31.716
You're a genius,

35:31.717 --> 35:33.285
and that is the best name
you could come up with?

35:33.286 --> 35:34.752
Watch it.

35:34.753 --> 35:35.853
If this is some sort of weapon,

35:35.854 --> 35:37.254
what's its power source?

35:39.390 --> 35:42.325
You're looking at him.

35:42.326 --> 35:43.560
Fascinating.

35:43.561 --> 35:45.195
Now untie us.

35:45.196 --> 35:46.597
No, you're safer tied up here.

35:46.598 --> 35:47.898
What are you going to do?

35:47.899 --> 35:52.601
I'm going to teach
those kids some manners.

35:52.602 --> 35:54.469
Oh, dear.

35:54.470 --> 35:55.903
I think Nikola's about to bite off

35:55.904 --> 35:57.171
more than he can chew.

36:13.622 --> 36:15.723
Hey.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.259
You know, you have such command

36:18.260 --> 36:21.762
of the queen's English.

36:31.506 --> 36:33.340
This thing works like a charm.

36:38.380 --> 36:39.615
What happened?

36:39.616 --> 36:41.617
You're fired.

36:49.692 --> 36:51.794
Oh, this is driving me nuts.

36:51.795 --> 36:54.564
Okay, look, why don't you, uh,
why don't you try to reach...

36:54.565 --> 36:55.598
D... don't.

36:55.599 --> 36:56.532
Just reach down...

36:56.533 --> 36:57.667
No.

36:57.668 --> 36:58.536
Can you... can you feel it?

36:58.537 --> 36:59.604
Oh, crap.

37:01.574 --> 37:02.707
Magnus...

37:02.708 --> 37:04.742
I'm trying.

37:04.743 --> 37:05.710
Faster is better.

37:05.711 --> 37:07.411
Ah...

37:07.412 --> 37:10.981
Ah, yes.

37:10.982 --> 37:12.816
Hey, well done.

37:12.817 --> 37:14.418
So, any time.

37:14.419 --> 37:15.652
Right.

37:15.653 --> 37:16.686
Ow.

37:28.864 --> 37:30.831
Unnecessary, but appreciated.

37:32.766 --> 37:34.300
You're welcome.

37:44.607 --> 37:45.673
What the hell did you do to me?

37:45.674 --> 37:46.840
You'll thank me in the morning.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.042
Sit! Stay!

37:59.749 --> 38:01.350
You should have stayed in med school.

38:02.651 --> 38:03.951
Nicely done.

38:03.952 --> 38:05.584
It's all in the wrist action.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.720
Hey!

38:12.256 --> 38:14.455
Toss it over or I'll kill her.

38:14.456 --> 38:15.589
Oh, not that old Chestnut.

38:15.590 --> 38:17.657
Put it down.

38:17.658 --> 38:19.292
Trust me, son, this
will all end in tears.

38:19.293 --> 38:20.360
Do it!

38:21.429 --> 38:24.395
Helen, I'm famished.

38:24.396 --> 38:25.495
Do you think you could
light the barbecue?

38:26.764 --> 38:29.428
Doubtful. They're only tranqs.

38:29.429 --> 38:30.696
Pity. Perhaps I could help?

38:30.697 --> 38:33.964
How very gracious of you.

38:33.965 --> 38:35.298
Magnus, shoot him!

38:35.299 --> 38:36.465
Shut up.

38:36.466 --> 38:37.667
Listen to me.

38:37.668 --> 38:38.968
I'll slice her, man.

38:38.969 --> 38:41.403
Hey, hey, hey, Chad, my man, my bro.

38:41.404 --> 38:43.372
We can work this out.

38:43.373 --> 38:44.473
It's not too late to hit rewind.

38:44.474 --> 38:46.475
Don't mess with me.

38:46.476 --> 38:47.676
I'm sensing there's some anger here.

38:47.677 --> 38:49.011
So...

38:49.012 --> 38:50.446
We were going to rule the world

38:50.447 --> 38:52.348
together, huh?

38:52.349 --> 38:54.417
See, the thing is,

38:54.418 --> 38:55.985
I'm more of a one-man show.

38:55.986 --> 38:57.753
So this was all some
sort of set-up, huh?

38:57.754 --> 38:58.887
Well, what can I say?

38:58.888 --> 39:00.322
Never trust anyone over 130.

39:00.323 --> 39:01.623
Helen...

39:01.624 --> 39:02.523
Yeah.

39:19.404 --> 39:20.437
You little...

39:29.879 --> 39:32.847
I... I can't...

39:32.848 --> 39:33.881
I can't...

39:33.882 --> 39:35.549
Nikola.

39:39.053 --> 39:40.753
I can't...

39:42.355 --> 39:46.724
Well, I hope you're all happy now.

39:49.795 --> 39:52.529
I'm ordinary.

40:10.011 --> 40:13.513
Hey, there you are.
I was looking for you.

40:13.514 --> 40:14.880
I'm sorry, Will.

40:14.881 --> 40:17.782
You must be holding dinner for me.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.484
Yeah, except it's 10:00.

40:20.485 --> 40:22.485
You've been in here for six hours.

40:22.486 --> 40:24.020
Oh.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.887
Have you gotten anywhere, at least?

40:25.888 --> 40:27.622
I'm afraid not.

40:27.623 --> 40:29.623
I've been trying to splice
together Nikola's DNA

40:29.624 --> 40:31.391
with the abnormal strands from Laura.

40:31.392 --> 40:33.526
It's just not working.

40:33.527 --> 40:35.427
Well, why don't you use
his research to help?

40:35.428 --> 40:36.528
I have been.

40:36.529 --> 40:37.662
His cells are rejecting

40:37.663 --> 40:39.463
the synthetic vector he created.

40:39.464 --> 40:40.998
Quite simply,

40:40.999 --> 40:43.400
there's no way to reverse
the effects of his de-vamper,

40:43.401 --> 40:44.434
speaking of which...

40:44.435 --> 40:47.069
He's in the lab with Laura.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.770
He's trying to cobble
together an energy source

40:48.771 --> 40:50.638
with enough juice to
power the de-vamper,

40:50.639 --> 40:52.139
now that he can't do it himself.

40:52.140 --> 40:56.775
And I'm guessing he figured it out.

40:56.776 --> 40:59.410
Well, I guess I better
break the news to him.

40:59.411 --> 41:00.677
Could you send him to my office, please?

41:00.678 --> 41:03.046
Yeah, sure.

41:03.047 --> 41:05.815
Hey, are you okay?

41:05.816 --> 41:07.049
Hmm?

41:07.050 --> 41:08.484
This really bothers you, doesn't it,

41:08.485 --> 41:10.085
the fact that you can't
get his powers back?

41:10.086 --> 41:11.786
It's not that.

41:11.787 --> 41:13.154
Well, I should hope not.

41:13.155 --> 41:14.121
I mean, the guy's been
a Thorn in your side

41:14.122 --> 41:15.689
for what, a century?

41:15.690 --> 41:17.424
Why are you working so hard

41:17.425 --> 41:19.526
to turn him back into a vampire?

41:19.527 --> 41:20.727
Nostalgia, perhaps?

41:21.995 --> 41:24.530
With Watson and Griffin dying,

41:24.531 --> 41:26.065
John's departure, and now Nikola...

41:28.668 --> 41:30.402
You're the last of the five.

41:40.113 --> 41:41.113
So?

41:41.114 --> 41:42.114
Yes, it's done.

41:42.115 --> 41:43.917
Laura is back to her snivelling,

41:43.918 --> 41:45.986
spoiled self.

41:45.987 --> 41:47.788
Oh.

41:47.789 --> 41:49.957
This may cheer you up.

41:49.958 --> 41:51.559
Oh, the premier cru?

41:51.560 --> 41:53.528
You must be feeling guilty.

41:53.529 --> 41:54.829
You can't seriously blame me for this?

41:54.830 --> 41:56.231
Forgive me, Helen.

41:56.232 --> 41:59.201
It's just my soul-crushing
depression talking.

41:59.202 --> 42:00.603
I'm not myself.

42:00.604 --> 42:01.871
On the contrary.

42:01.872 --> 42:03.874
You are your real self again...

42:03.875 --> 42:05.976
human, mortal.

42:05.977 --> 42:07.645
Watch your language.

42:07.646 --> 42:09.147
I'm sorry, Nikola, but it's true.

42:09.148 --> 42:10.649
I've tried everything I can think of.

42:10.650 --> 42:13.085
There's simply no way to re-vamp you.

42:13.086 --> 42:14.186
You see how this puts
a crimp in my plans

42:14.187 --> 42:16.521
for world domination?

42:16.522 --> 42:18.123
Not to say I won't keep trying.

42:18.124 --> 42:19.858
I would expect nothing less.

42:19.859 --> 42:21.392
Very well.

42:21.393 --> 42:23.796
If this is to be a wake,
then let's do it properly.

42:23.797 --> 42:24.964
Join me in a toast.

42:26.201 --> 42:28.037
To happier times.

42:28.038 --> 42:30.705
To those halcyon days
of bloodlust now gone,

42:30.706 --> 42:33.207
plus you gotta admit,
vampires are just plain cool.

42:33.208 --> 42:34.640
Amen.

42:34.641 --> 42:37.609
Here's to the glorious vampire race,

42:37.610 --> 42:39.609
once mighty, now extinct.

42:43.112 --> 42:44.913
Mmm...

42:58.225 --> 42:59.691
Well...

43:01.193 --> 43:03.027
I can work with that.
