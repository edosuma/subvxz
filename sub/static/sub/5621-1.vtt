00:33.634 --> 00:36.502
Why don't you say that again,
so that everyone can hear you.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.703
I wasn't on the rooftop.

00:37.705 --> 00:41.240
She wasn't... on... the rooftop.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.042
You need to settle, Grinder.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.710
I don't settle! Ever!

00:44.712 --> 00:47.146
This is our house!

00:47.148 --> 00:49.248
Stutz & Grinder!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.482
Was he a good man? No.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.351
But that doesn't make...

00:52.353 --> 00:54.553
him a killer.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.523
He's mouthing
the freaking words.
Shh, shh, shh.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.726
¶ Ring around the rosie ¶
What is it that I'm not seeing?

01:02.596 --> 01:04.096
<i> What if this is the one</i>
<i> I can't win?</i>

01:04.098 --> 01:07.099
What if it's the one
you have to?

01:07.101 --> 01:09.168
(music swells)

01:20.014 --> 01:21.246
Grinder rests.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.483
One last time.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.056
WOMAN:
Wow. Wow.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.225
Whoa.
That was so tight.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.860
I loved that.
Powerful stuff, son.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.061
Wow.
Amazing.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.529
Yeah, no,
that was, uh...

01:37.531 --> 01:40.032
that was a good finale.
It was amazing.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.034
It's-it's so cool, like,
watching you, like,

01:42.036 --> 01:43.869
watch the show and stuff.
And it seemed

01:43.871 --> 01:46.371
truthful to-to you guys
as lawyers?
Oh, yeah.

01:46.373 --> 01:49.374
Yeah. It was great.
It felt as-as real as...

01:49.376 --> 01:51.710
as all the other ones.
So what was

01:51.712 --> 01:53.212
your favorite part about it,
little bro?

01:53.214 --> 01:56.715
Well, it-it was a...
it was a g-good case.

01:56.717 --> 01:57.716
Mmm.
A very...

01:57.718 --> 01:59.718
a very satisfying way to...

01:59.720 --> 02:01.820
to-to say good-bye to the show.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.821
Could you be more specific?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.623
Sure. Um, I liked

02:04.625 --> 02:06.725
that, um...

02:06.727 --> 02:08.060
that he was
a lone wolf,

02:08.062 --> 02:09.728
you know? Uh, The Grinder.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.729
And...

02:10.731 --> 02:12.131
yet now he's decided

02:12.133 --> 02:14.066
to have a-a family.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.735
That's one way to interpret it.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.337
So,

02:18.339 --> 02:19.738
what are you gonna do now,
Uncle Dean?

02:19.740 --> 02:23.075
(sighs)
I don't know.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.576
I mean, right
now, I'm just...

02:24.578 --> 02:26.945
driving on the highway of...

02:26.947 --> 02:28.747
"what the hell is my life,"

02:28.749 --> 02:31.583
looking for a off-ramp.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.352
I think I just got

02:33.354 --> 02:35.087
to pull the car over, you know?

02:35.089 --> 02:36.588
Just get out and...

02:36.590 --> 02:38.757
see what life has to offer.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.159
Makes total sense.
I get it.
I get it.
Yeah.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.760
Just take it all in.
Change the oil maybe.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.529
Totally.
Take a deep breath.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.963
Pull out the key.
Stretch your
legs a little.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.465
100%.
See what's out there.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.533
Am I the only one who thinks

02:47.535 --> 02:48.534
this highway thing is stupid?

02:48.536 --> 02:49.601
The "life is a highway"?

02:49.603 --> 02:50.769
He didn't just invent that,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.371
you know, tonight, here.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.373
You are really upset
about this highway metaphor.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.441
I hate that he brings this out
in me. You know?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.277
I'm not that guy.
You're not that guy.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.212
I'm this guy!
Yeah, you are.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.114
I'm cool!
You're so cool.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.616
It's gonna be fine, honey. He's
leaving in, like, three days.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.652
Like his show ending is an
existential dilemma, you know?

03:06.654 --> 03:07.653
I know.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.221
It's ridiculous.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.656
It is ridiculous.
I don't think you realize

03:10.658 --> 03:11.957
how ridiculous it is.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.792
And everyone's
so worried about him.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.228
Hey, you know what?
The TV star is gonna be fine.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.297
Look at me. I'm a mess.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.965
It's all right, babe.
You just get riled up

03:19.967 --> 03:22.167
every time he comes into town
because, you know,

03:22.169 --> 03:25.571
he's this big star and it makes
you feel like a side character.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.307
No, that's not it at all.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.475
I don't feel like
a side character.
I know, right?

03:30.477 --> 03:32.144
Who would say something
like that?

03:32.146 --> 03:34.646
You just said it
two seconds ago.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.982
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Don't-don't be...
You think being cute's

03:36.984 --> 03:38.984
gonna make me forget
the side character thing?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.752
Is it a little bit?
A little bit it is.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.655
It is... Yes, it's working
surprisingly well, actually.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.691
You're very good at this.
(chuckles)

03:45.693 --> 03:48.327
Mom, Dad, is it cool if Joel
Zadak comes over tomorrow night?

03:48.329 --> 03:50.729
The... tenth grader?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.331
That's the football player,
right?

03:52.333 --> 03:55.167
Yeah.
He wants to... with you?
Here-Here?

03:55.169 --> 03:57.035
I've been really coming
into my own lately,

03:57.037 --> 03:59.671
and I think
he's picking up on that.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.506
Oh.
Okay.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.242
Cool.
Sure.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.243
Awesome.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.112
"Pace."
"Pay-eece."

04:07.114 --> 04:08.914
"Pace."

04:08.916 --> 04:12.084
Coming into his own
kind of like a-a douchebag, huh?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.151
Oh, my God.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.689
Hey.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.425
Couldn't sleep.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.094
It's 8:30.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.197
Man, I like
what you got here.
Thank you, Dean.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.966
You've got it all figured out,
you know? You always have.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.036
Kids are growing
up so good, and...

04:31.038 --> 04:33.038
Debbie, man...
(chuckles)

04:33.040 --> 04:35.274
Wow, I forgot
how rad she is.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.209
It's beautiful to see.

04:37.211 --> 04:40.646
It's beautiful.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.381
I have none of it.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.486
Dean, you're being
a little dramatic.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.587
You have a lot.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.621
You did it. I mean,

04:49.623 --> 04:50.956
you made the
right choices

04:50.958 --> 04:52.491
that lead to a meaningful life.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.960
And I want that. And...

04:54.962 --> 04:57.162
you make me think I can have it.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.731
I make you think that?
I love you, brother.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.333
I love you so damn much.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.334
(kisses)

05:02.336 --> 05:04.336
You inspire me, man.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.405
Okay. Okay.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.006
Oh.
(grunts)

05:08.008 --> 05:09.474
We don't do this enough,

05:09.476 --> 05:13.512
hug for a really long time
like this.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.414
DEAN:
What's with the notecards, Stew?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.948
Your kid brother
still gets butterflies

05:16.950 --> 05:18.183
before he goes to court.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.252
Hey, man.
Can I pitch something?

05:20.254 --> 05:22.154
I can't imagine
that'd be helpful.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.324
Oh, yeah.
What the hell, Dean?

05:25.326 --> 05:26.491
I need those cards!

05:26.493 --> 05:28.093
You only think you need them.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.163
What's the precedent?
<i> Kemper v. Manheim,</i> 1997.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.166
Camryn Manheim. See? You're like
an encyclopedia for this crap.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.534
You're perfect. Let's go.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.103
MAN:
Grinder!
Hey, man! Thanks for watching!

05:38.105 --> 05:39.104
Love ya!

05:39.106 --> 05:40.105
Prelim hearing,

05:40.107 --> 05:41.606
<i> Krantz v. Ramirez.</i>

05:41.608 --> 05:43.508
Counsel?

05:43.510 --> 05:44.776
(clears throat)

05:52.553 --> 05:53.602
(clears throat)

05:53.603 --> 05:54.652
(rapidly):
Your Honor, my client,
Victor Ramirez, has resided

05:54.655 --> 05:55.787
at 887 Oak for nine years.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.055
On June 5,
landlord Albert T. Krantz

05:57.057 --> 05:58.724
attempted to raise
monthly rent to $750,

05:58.726 --> 06:01.693
violating section 2-9A of
the Idaho general statu...

06:01.695 --> 06:04.129
statute.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.400
Um, I have a question.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.369
Have you ever talked before?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.638
(whispers):
Nice.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.045
He claims that by missing
the March payment, you violated

06:20.047 --> 06:22.247
the terms of the lease,
giving him cause to terminate

06:22.249 --> 06:23.915
and issue you a new
lease at, essentially,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.317
whatever rate he wants.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.986
We didn't miss payment.
He just never cash it.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.155
Because he want us out
to raise rent.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.491
We hear that
and we empathize with it,

06:32.493 --> 06:35.594
but, frankly, this missing check
is just crushing us.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.496
He's offering you $1,000
to cover moving costs,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.598
and we recommend you take it
and settle.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.832
DEAN:
Counsel?

06:42.403 --> 06:44.102
Do you mind if I counter?

06:44.104 --> 06:46.471
That seems
wildly inappropriate.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.443
We don't move.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.446
And we don't pay
one more cent in rent.
Dean...

06:54.448 --> 06:56.114
I like that plan.
Are you Grinder?

06:56.116 --> 06:57.582
Is he helping with case?
No.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.185
He is not helping.
He's not a lawyer.
Right now,

07:00.187 --> 07:04.790
this case is
all about apartments and rent.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.926
But what it should be about...

07:07.928 --> 07:09.361
is character.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.796
I say

07:10.798 --> 07:12.297
we turn this whole
thing on its head

07:12.299 --> 07:13.799
and put Krantz on the defensive.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.867
That sound smart to me.
Me, too. Stew?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.536
No. This is a
terrible idea.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.637
We should
definitely settle.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.138
We will 100%
lose the case.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.374
I feel like I'm in
a<i> Grinder</i> episode right now.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.609
Season four, episode nine.
"Settle to the Metal."

07:24.611 --> 07:26.311
We learned something
very important in that episode.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.780
The Grinder never settles.
Settles.
He never settles.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.816
It's not-not in his nature.
Mm-mm.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.651
I need to ask
everyone here,

07:32.653 --> 07:34.486
is it in our nature

07:34.488 --> 07:36.488
to settle?
I don't think so.
No, señor.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.889
I'm tired of settling.
Yeah.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.958
I feel like all we do
around here is settle.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.326
I can't believe this is
an actual conversation.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.828
Victor, this is your call.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.162
Do you want to
pack your things?

07:44.164 --> 07:46.698
Or do you want
to roll the dice?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.838
Mr. Stewart,

07:52.840 --> 07:54.639
we roll the dice.
Ah.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.308
Go to trial
like The Grinder say.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.309
Yeah!

07:57.311 --> 07:58.743
Grind it!
Yeah.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.816
That was so exciting!
Man!

08:04.818 --> 08:06.251
It's so clear
to me now.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.254
Dad was a great lawyer.
You're a great lawyer.

08:09.256 --> 08:12.791
I became a character
who was a great lawyer.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.594
I need to be doing this
for real.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.196
So you're gonna go
to law school?
Well,

08:18.198 --> 08:19.865
I don't think I need that,
what with the show and all.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.700
Oh, sure, well, acting
on a TV show's the equivalent

08:21.702 --> 08:23.702
of going to law school,
so why would you need that?

08:23.704 --> 08:26.171
How can I say this?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.540
Let's say you're
at a restaurant,

08:28.542 --> 08:30.775
and Noah Wyle
is two tables down.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.310
You go into cardiac arrest.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.212
You don't think Noah Wyle
could step in and help?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.647
I like this analogy.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.649
Yes, he could help,
by calling a doctor.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.885
Because he is an actor.
So you would rather go

08:39.887 --> 08:42.721
into cardiac arrest next to
someone who didn't play a doctor

08:42.723 --> 08:45.457
on television,
rather than Noah Wyle, who did

08:45.459 --> 08:47.359
and probably picked stuff up
along the way?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.461
Not me. I'll take Wyle.
Okay, fine.

08:49.463 --> 08:53.064
I guess in this
very specific hypothetical,

08:53.066 --> 08:55.901
I would rather have
a heart attack

08:55.903 --> 08:58.069
next to Noah Wyle.
Absolutely.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.304
Grinder rests.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.640
STEWART:
<i> And now,</i>

09:01.642 --> 09:02.908
we are going to trial

09:02.910 --> 09:04.242
on an eviction case

09:04.244 --> 09:06.711
for a $650-a-month apartment.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.713
I think it's sweet, actually,
you know?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.382
He's trying to impress you.
He wants to be more

09:10.384 --> 09:12.984
like his brother,
as well he should.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.553
And you know Dean.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.588
He's probably already
on to something else.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.924
(knocking on door)
Hey, guys.
Is an adversary proceeding

09:18.926 --> 09:20.926
basically just a trial
that takes place

09:20.928 --> 09:22.894
within the context
of a bankruptcy case?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.930
Yeah, pretty much. Why?

09:24.932 --> 09:27.766
I got my assistant hooking up
the bar for later in the month.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.335
Oh, you're taking the bar? Here?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.270
So you're gonna stay, here,
longer?

09:32.272 --> 09:34.573
Well, you can't take
the Idaho Bar in California.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.775
(chuckles) Come on, man.
Stick with me on this.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.577
(chuckles)
I guess you're right, Dean.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.712
You have to stay here
to take the bar here.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.181
Be good, you two.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.749
You be good!
(door closes)

09:44.751 --> 09:46.451
I mean, it actually sounds
like he knows

09:46.453 --> 09:48.286
what he's talking about.
That's the thing,

09:48.288 --> 09:50.121
Deb, it's just words, you know?

09:50.123 --> 09:52.958
Yes, in eight years on his show,
he knows a lot of legal words,

09:52.960 --> 09:55.627
but he doesn't know what
they mean. I know the words,

09:55.629 --> 09:57.596
but I just can't say
them right all the time.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.965
You say them really well,
sweetie.
He's never gonna leave!

09:59.967 --> 10:01.967
(high-pitched): He's-he's
gonna stay here forever,

10:01.969 --> 10:04.135
and I'm gonna be stuck talking
up here in this octave forever.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.737
I hope not.
I don't think it is up here.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.038
It's bad.
(deep voice):
I talk down here.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.307
This is my normal voice.
No, that's too low.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.375
That's a little low.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.476
But here's right.
Here's right.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.644
Right there?
There you are. Uh-huh.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.045
He-he thinks he's The Grinder.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.280
He doesn't know
about the grind--

10:15.282 --> 10:17.315
I know about the grind.
I-I grind.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.050
I go to work every day,

10:19.052 --> 10:20.652
for years and years,
and what do I do there?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.554
Grind?
I grind. Because
I am The Grinder.

10:22.556 --> 10:25.991
Yeah. Okay.
I grind hard. All right,
well, I'm gonna notecard this.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.993
And I am gonna address
this, to his face,
Mm-hmm.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.894
first thing in
the morning. Okay?
Good.

10:29.896 --> 10:33.898
One, you need to
leave Wednesday,

10:33.900 --> 10:36.501
as planned, Dean.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.203
Great card. Mm-hmm.
Thank you. Two...

10:40.907 --> 10:42.841
Hey.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.309
Where's your
football player friend?

10:44.311 --> 10:47.078
He's... just in the bathroom.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.415
Huh.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.853
He's not coming back,
is he?
No.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.321
He's with Lizzie.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.590
Dad doesn't let her
have boys over.

10:58.592 --> 11:01.192
I was used, Uncle Dean.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.094
I've been there.
It's fine.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.696
Everyone at school knows
he's here,

11:04.698 --> 11:06.431
and I'll get some mileage
out of that.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.433
It's a good thing,
big picture.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.568
No.

11:12.539 --> 11:16.007
We are going to nail
that kid to the wall.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.343
Let's just lay all the
cards out on the table.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.880
Joel, Lizzie, we know
what's going on.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.048
I don't know what
you're talking about, bro.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.450
Hey! I'm fine with it.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.685
But I need to make sure
that both sides

11:26.687 --> 11:27.852
are taken care of.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.888
My man E has
been wronged.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.290
He needs to get something
out of this.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.726
Make us an offer.
What are you guys thinking?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.628
What?
They've got us
in a corner, babe.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.198
Fine. Tomorrow at school,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.067
I'll tell everybody
how much fun I had here,

11:42.069 --> 11:44.035
and I'll even say
he's a solid hang.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.206
(whispers):
That sounds pretty fair.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.641
No.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.543
We want pictures.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.811
From your private

11:52.813 --> 11:54.879
online accounts, posted,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.648
giving him a piggyback ride.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.416
Hashtag "bestfriends,"

11:58.418 --> 12:00.719
hashtag "teenlife."

12:00.721 --> 12:01.753
Hashtag "teenlife"?

12:01.755 --> 12:03.254
What part...

12:03.256 --> 12:06.224
of "hashtag teenlife"

12:06.226 --> 12:08.226
do you not understand?

12:09.563 --> 12:11.029
STEWART:<i> Dean, we need to have</i>
<i> a conversation,</i>

12:11.031 --> 12:12.897
<i> and I would like to know</i>
<i> specific times and dates</i>

12:12.899 --> 12:13.932
<i> of your departure.</i>

12:13.934 --> 12:15.100
<i> Use the cards.</i>

12:15.102 --> 12:16.601
<i> Cards are your friends,</i>
<i> not a crutch.</i>

12:16.603 --> 12:19.437
Hey, Dean, uh,
I really need to t...

12:19.439 --> 12:22.273
That my suit?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's wardrobe.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.442
It's part of the process.
Tells me a lot about somebody.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.111
I love watching
the transformation.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.079
Dean, can I just talk to you
for a quick second?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.114
No, we don't have time
for quick secs.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.949
Look, we've got
to get the word out

12:30.951 --> 12:32.684
about how unsavory
this Krantz character is.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.018
(chuckles):
I love it.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.621
The Sanderson boys
riding again.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.623
Right? I mean,
lately I've been so,

12:38.625 --> 12:42.093
I don't know, lost, and...
these last few days,

12:42.095 --> 12:44.295
being here, I realized
what I've been missing,

12:44.297 --> 12:45.864
and it's this.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.268
I'm sorry, you-you wanted
to ask me something.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.704
It can wait.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.706
REPORTER:<i> We are here</i>
<i> with The Grinder himself,</i>

12:54.708 --> 12:56.307
<i> Dean Sanderson.</i>

12:56.309 --> 12:57.942
What brings you home to Boise?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.978
Well, I'm actually here
to find myself.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.547
And I also happen to be
working on a case.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.949
One that's very personal
to me, Emily.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.484
There's a snake
in the village.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.719
A viper.

13:07.721 --> 13:08.987
Albert Krantz,

13:08.989 --> 13:10.221
<i> I am calling you out, sir.</i>

13:10.223 --> 13:11.956
<i> This town is pushing back.</i>

13:11.958 --> 13:15.727
<i> And we, the people,</i>
<i> will see you in court.</i>

13:15.729 --> 13:18.229
(paparazzi clamoring)

13:18.231 --> 13:19.664
It's just the brother.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.132
Yes, it's just the brother.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.572
You scared me.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.440
I gave a lecture
at the law school today.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.608
Of course you did.
And afterwards,

13:30.610 --> 13:32.076
a student came up to me

13:32.078 --> 13:33.645
and it was the usual,
"I love you,

13:33.647 --> 13:35.113
I love the show,
you inspire me."

13:35.115 --> 13:36.915
But then she told me

13:36.917 --> 13:38.449
that she was a single mother

13:38.451 --> 13:41.619
and she had a daughter
fighting for her life.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.422
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.357
God, that's awful.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.426
Yeah, it is.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.595
So she asked me to sign her
daughter's hospital bracelet--

13:50.597 --> 13:52.597
said it would mean
the world to her--

13:52.599 --> 13:56.434
and I reached into
my jacket pocket to get a pen.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.771
But there was no pen.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.973
Just these...

14:01.975 --> 14:04.776
hurtful,
hurtful words.

14:04.778 --> 14:07.612
Needless to say, that little
girl never got her autograph.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.647
Dean, I'm sorry, I...

14:09.649 --> 14:11.616
Why didn't you sign
the bracelet?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.618
Is this how you feel about me?

14:13.620 --> 14:16.221
Just say it.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.123
Do you know
what your problem is?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.392
You don't push back.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.727
Ever.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.396
Krantz says, "Move out,"
you say, "Fine."

14:25.398 --> 14:27.298
Well, you know what I do?
I push back.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.634
Joel Zadak--
he wants to use Ethan

14:29.636 --> 14:31.135
to get with Lizzie,
and Ethan's

14:31.137 --> 14:33.137
supposed to sit back
and take it?
Wait, what?

14:33.139 --> 14:34.672
Oh, yeah, you didn't
know about that?
Mm-mm.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.307
Don't worry, I pushed back.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.076
And I got the kid a great deal.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.245
Now Zadak's gonna
tell everybody at school

14:40.247 --> 14:42.480
that Ethan's a great kid--
it's a win-win for everybody.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.982
Wait a second.
Let me just...

14:43.984 --> 14:49.153
This kid was using Ethan
to get with my daughter,

14:49.155 --> 14:52.190
and your solution
was to leverage her

14:52.192 --> 14:54.926
for his junior high
school popularity?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.828
The way you're saying that

14:56.830 --> 14:58.663
makes it sound
worse than it was.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.164
I said it the exact way
you said it.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.332
I just repeated it
back to you.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.500
You're hearing it
for the first time,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.002
and it sounds terrible.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.005
Well, then I would maybe
push back on that, too.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.673
All right, you want me
to push back, Dean?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.508
This is me pushing back.
Off the cards.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.343
We are done here.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.045
I don't want you talking to
my clients, I don't want you

15:14.047 --> 15:16.381
in my house, I don't want
you meddling with my kids.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.016
I don't even know why
you're here, Dean.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.517
Just-just...

15:19.519 --> 15:21.586
leave us alone.

15:22.856 --> 15:25.189
Wow.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.525
Turns out you didn't
need the cards.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.194
You were able to hurt me
right to my face.

15:31.865 --> 15:34.365
Congratulations, Counselor,
I accept your deal.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.535
I will leave.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.370
Tomorrow.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.439
At first light.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.277
First light.
Just say "morning."

15:49.716 --> 15:51.015
(crowd murmuring)

15:54.287 --> 15:55.987
(indistinct chatter)

15:59.559 --> 16:01.392
Where is Grinder?
I don't see Grinder.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.094
Stewart, you want to
break it to your clients

16:03.096 --> 16:04.762
why he's not here?

16:04.764 --> 16:05.964
Where's our guy?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.132
Uh... (clears throat)

16:08.134 --> 16:09.133
Your Honor,

16:09.135 --> 16:10.601
uh...

16:10.603 --> 16:13.972
my brother and I got in...
into a fight.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.473
Um...

16:15.475 --> 16:17.775
I maybe said some things that

16:17.777 --> 16:19.911
I probably shouldn't have.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.112
At the time,
I felt like I wanted

16:21.114 --> 16:22.313
to say them,
but now I feel...

16:22.315 --> 16:24.916
said too much about it
already. Anyway,

16:24.918 --> 16:27.919
he's... mad at me,

16:27.921 --> 16:30.254
and he's not coming.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.124
(gallery groans)
MAN: Seriously? Come on!

16:33.126 --> 16:35.126
Sadly, we still need

16:35.128 --> 16:37.462
to continue,
even without The Grinder.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.497
Opening arguments.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.765
(gavel bangs)

16:42.268 --> 16:43.968
REPORTER:
Dean Sanderson,

16:43.970 --> 16:46.504
surprisingly a no-show.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.273
I can't watch this anymore.
Check, please.

16:49.275 --> 16:52.343
You're not gonna...
finish what you started?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.883
(dramatic music builds,
then swells)

17:01.154 --> 17:02.653
(rapidly): My clients
are upstanding citizens

17:02.655 --> 17:04.355
who never once
failed to pay their rent.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.992
All the prosecution has proven
is that the plaintiff...

17:07.994 --> 17:10.795
didn't deposit a rent check
ten days before it was due.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.296
But according
to the plaintiff, there's...

17:12.298 --> 17:14.966
no way to... prove that.

17:14.968 --> 17:17.235
Or is there?
(gallery gasps)

17:19.973 --> 17:21.706
Finally.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.342
The defense calls
Mr. Albert Krantz.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.576
Objection, Your Honor.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.478
Dean Sanderson is not
an actual lawyer.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.414
Oh, please. This is why
we're here, Leonard.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.149
Seriously?
How you doing?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.483
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.318
Uh, objection-- you can't
touch the judge.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.720
Shut up. I'll allow it.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.155
I got this.
You got this.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.023
JUDGE:
Mr. Krantz.
Can we...

17:39.025 --> 17:40.558
Do you mind if I...
Yeah, sure.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.993
Oh, wait.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.327
We'd be backlit.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.829
Oh, you know
what you're doing.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.165
There you go. Thanks.
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.867
Mr. Krantz, is it your
contention that you were not

17:49.869 --> 17:53.204
in receipt of a check for
one month's rent from my client?

17:53.206 --> 17:54.872
Aren't I supposed
to be sworn in?

17:54.874 --> 17:56.908
And isn't it also true
that you have a history

17:56.910 --> 17:58.342
of being a monumental
douchebag?

17:58.344 --> 17:59.710
Objection.
Sustained.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.079
That's her thing.
I'll allow it.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.581
Uh...
Therefore... Oh.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.650
May I borrow
your glasses?
Mm-hmm.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.253
Therefore,
if the defense were able

18:09.255 --> 18:12.256
to produce this missing check
and prove that it had been

18:12.258 --> 18:14.192
in your possession,
we could all go home.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.593
I guess.
But that's not gonna happen,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.261
because there is no check.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.030
DEAN: I would like to enter
into evidence

18:19.032 --> 18:20.364
Exhibit A.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.866
Let the record show

18:21.868 --> 18:23.701
that I hold in my hand
a rent check,

18:23.703 --> 18:26.537
dated March 1, 2015,

18:26.539 --> 18:29.574
from Victor Ramirez
to Albert Krantz.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.409
What?
What?

18:31.411 --> 18:32.610
(gallery murmurs)

18:32.612 --> 18:33.911
I went into your Dumpster,

18:33.913 --> 18:35.947
right outside the apartment.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.082
It was just sitting there,

18:38.084 --> 18:39.984
smiling at me.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.552
Is this actually working?
Shh.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.720
Okay, this is absurd.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.055
I never threw away any check.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.990
You know what?
I believe you.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.391
Because all this time,

18:47.393 --> 18:49.627
I'd been thinking that
you're some mastermind,

18:49.629 --> 18:52.096
someone who hides checks.

18:52.098 --> 18:55.066
But the truth is...

18:55.068 --> 18:56.834
this check just
slipped by you.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.171
Albert Krantz

19:00.173 --> 19:02.340
is not a menace to society.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.176
He is a menace to intelligence.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.611
Because the man's an idiot.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.846
O-Okay, Leonard,
I would object to that.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.948
Oh, would you?
A check-losing idiot.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.351
I have not lost a check
in 15 years.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.353
You lost<i> this</i> check.
That's not the check.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.588
It<i> is</i> the check.
It can't be the check!

19:17.590 --> 19:19.690
Why not?!
Why can't it be the check?!

19:19.692 --> 19:21.459
Tell me why
this can't be the check!

19:21.461 --> 19:23.094
Because I destroyed the check!

19:23.096 --> 19:24.595
Oh! Aah!
(gallery exclaims)

19:29.802 --> 19:31.202
Open it.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.374
What it say?
Yeah.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.875
What it say?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.779
"Grinder rests."

19:41.781 --> 19:43.681
(gallery cheering)

19:45.685 --> 19:47.218

19:47.220 --> 19:49.787

yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.124
We've all seen the show.
It's great.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.125
Thank you.
Your Honor,

19:54.127 --> 19:55.493
this is insanity.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.795
I have ten million objections,
rounding down.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.630
Firstly: not a lawyer.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.799
We had talked about that
all too briefly.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.834
They're calling up witnesses
during closing,

20:03.836 --> 20:05.236
bringing in
new evidence.
All right,

20:05.238 --> 20:07.238
I'm afraid that counsel
is right.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.340
As thrilling as it was,

20:09.342 --> 20:10.641
none of it is admissible.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.410
(gallery groans)
LEONARD: Thank you.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.080
Uh, Your Honor, if I may...

20:17.917 --> 20:19.984
The defense is pushing back.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.093
<i> Kitzmiller v. Dover,</i> 1984.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.661
The defense introduces testimony

20:30.663 --> 20:32.263
<i> Schacter v. Bloom,</i> 1997,

20:32.265 --> 20:34.665

20:38.204 --> 20:40.037
JUDGE: All right,
we get the idea.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.439
Mm-hmm.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.107
You know, he's right.
Sorry, Leonard.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.375
What?
I'll allow it.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.646
Me, too.
DEAN: I know.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.047
Life's funny that way.

Sometimes you find exactly

21:36.729 --> 21:39.764

love having me here,

21:39.766 --> 21:42.500
but you're the only
family I got.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.335
And it's been...

21:44.337 --> 21:46.137
great.

21:47.573 --> 21:50.741
So, thanks.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.277
Take care of each other.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.812

I'm sorry, did you
say something?

22:20.473 --> 22:22.606
Maybe you don't have to go.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.445
Maybe this is...

22:27.447 --> 22:29.880
your off-ramp.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.615
So you feel it, too?

22:31.617 --> 22:34.051
I do. I do feel it.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.554
And you think
we make a good team?
Mm-hmm.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.823
And I could wear your suits
and give advice to the kids?
Mm...

22:38.825 --> 22:40.124
I'm getting out of this car

22:40.126 --> 22:41.292
