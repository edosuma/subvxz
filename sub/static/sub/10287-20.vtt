All rise.

00:06.705 --> 00:09.296
Criminal court part two
is now in session.

00:09.475 --> 00:11.405
The honorab|e--

00:17.183 --> 00:23.253
And semi-mystical.
Harold T. Stone presiding.

00:25.558 --> 00:28.048
All right. sit down.

00:28.494 --> 00:29.724
Nobody even blinked.

00:29.894 --> 00:31.264
I guess they're used to you.

00:31.428 --> 00:35.058
-You mean--?
-The thrill is gone, yes. sir.

00:35.299 --> 00:37.559
Uh. here's the docket.

00:37.734 --> 00:40.534
Now all we need are the attorneys.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.673
Bull. where are Dan and Billie?

00:49.813 --> 00:52.113
Not here. Your Honor.

00:52.582 --> 00:55.642
They had to run to city hall.
They're both up for an appointment...

00:55.818 --> 00:58.618
...with the new commission
on crime and youthful offenders.

00:58.788 --> 01:01.018
-Then maybe they're stuck in traffic.
-Yeah.

01:01.190 --> 01:04.180
I know. I know. I'm late.
I am terribly sorry. forgive me.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.490
I am ashamed. I beg your apology...

01:06.662 --> 01:09.602
...and I promise the court
that it will never happen again.

01:09.765 --> 01:10.815
Dan's not here. either.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.560
Can you believe his nerve.
keeping us waiting like this?

01:16.105 --> 01:19.165
-How'd the interview go. counselor?
-Not bad.

01:19.342 --> 01:22.972
I think I demonstrated a lot of knowledge
about crime problems and kids.

01:23.145 --> 01:24.365
Great. What about Dan?

01:24.546 --> 01:26.006
He took another approach.

01:26.181 --> 01:29.171
Fielding, Fielding, Fielding.

01:29.351 --> 01:32.221
Fielding, Fielding, Fielding.

01:32.387 --> 01:35.077
-Fielding, Fielding, Fielding.
-All right. Let me down.

01:35.257 --> 01:36.917
Come on. guys. let me down.

01:37.091 --> 01:38.891
-Fielding.
-Ha. ha.

01:39.059 --> 01:41.429
-Hi.
-You're late.

01:41.595 --> 01:44.715
I know. and I tried to tell them.

01:44.899 --> 01:48.299
Doesn't it do your heart good
to see such an outpouring of affection?

01:48.468 --> 01:49.828
You paid those kids.

01:50.002 --> 01:51.972
-Not yet. he hasn't.
-HeY. later.

01:53.505 --> 01:56.095
What a lovely gang of lads. huh?

01:56.274 --> 01:59.044
And surprisingly affordable too. I'll bet.

01:59.610 --> 02:01.770
Well. they do receive a small stipend...

02:01.945 --> 02:05.375
...but it's part of a work-study program
that I established.

02:05.549 --> 02:08.249
-You're buying their support.
-No. no. no.

02:08.418 --> 02:11.148
I'm teaching them
that I can buy their support.

02:11.321 --> 02:13.881
Say. what about that first case. huh?
Bull.

02:14.057 --> 02:15.457
What do we got. Mac?

02:15.625 --> 02:20.755
Seven counts of lewd and immoral conduct.
five counts of prostitution...

02:20.931 --> 02:23.561
...couple of counts of intent
to commit acts of prostitution.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.573
-Whoa. all by one person?
-No. sir. we have four defendants.

02:26.736 --> 02:29.536

02:29.706 --> 02:35.076

-Ouon Le. what the hell is this all about?

03:24.060 --> 03:25.390
Hi. Mac.

03:25.562 --> 03:27.432
That is my husband.

03:27.597 --> 03:29.187
You never mentioned being married.

03:29.365 --> 03:31.385
Oh. yes. Four months ago.

03:31.566 --> 03:33.856
But I haven't seen him
since the wedding.

03:34.034 --> 03:37.304
-This what they call an open relationship?
-Excuse me--

03:37.471 --> 03:41.101
Actually. Mac is just sort of
temporarily acting in the role of spouse.

03:41.274 --> 03:45.114
That's all we did.
and we got busted for it.

03:45.277 --> 03:47.767
-Well. perhaps--
-Mac and Ouon Le are legally married.

03:47.947 --> 03:50.207
It's a formality.
so she can stay in the country.

03:50.383 --> 03:53.653
-Well. isn't that illegal?
-Well. of course it is.

03:53.819 --> 03:55.549
Say. when did I lose control?

03:56.855 --> 03:59.015
-Right off the bat. huh?
BILLIE: Your Honor.

03:59.189 --> 04:00.209
Miss Young.

04:00.991 --> 04:05.161
As far as I can tell. Ouon Le just happened
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.349
It's true.

04:06.530 --> 04:07.930
I had no place to stay...

04:08.098 --> 04:11.688
...so my new American friends
let me be their roommate.

04:11.869 --> 04:17.238
According to this report. they let
the entire merchant fleet be their roommate.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.378
My clients have indicated
they'd be willing to plead no contest...

04:21.545 --> 04:25.475
...on the first three charges
provided prosecution drops the rest.

04:25.649 --> 04:27.009
-Agreed.
-Peachy.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.883
Court finds the defendants guilty.

04:29.052 --> 04:30.182
All the defendants?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.453
Correction.
Ouon Le Duc is found not guilty...

04:32.622 --> 04:37.062
...by reason of excessive innocence.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.880
Thank you. Your Honor.

04:39.062 --> 04:44.062
Now. as for Tawny and the Tawnettes here.

-Recess.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.730
Sorry. sir. I....

04:54.909 --> 04:56.839
Forget it.

04:59.313 --> 05:02.413
So how was it with somebody else?

05:04.552 --> 05:06.652
Okay. let's go.

05:06.921 --> 05:10.121
Say. you're sexy.

05:10.291 --> 05:13.061
I know. it's a curse.

05:13.627 --> 05:16.097
Ouon Le. how'd you wind up
with those bimbos?

05:16.263 --> 05:19.793
When we got married. I thought you had
an apartment on the Lower East Side.

05:19.967 --> 05:23.427
I did. but I had to move
after the men broke in.

05:23.604 --> 05:25.264
Somebody broke into your apartment?

05:25.672 --> 05:28.402
-To put the fire out.
-You had a fire?

05:28.942 --> 05:32.542
-Yes. My drapes started burning.
-How did that happen?

05:33.446 --> 05:34.806
Sparks from the couch.

05:35.414 --> 05:37.544
Which was in flames because...?

05:37.716 --> 05:39.476
The microwave exploded.

05:39.651 --> 05:41.621
Due to an erroneous setting whi|e....

05:41.787 --> 05:43.757
Heating a can of Cheez Whiz.

It's about the appointment
on the commission.

06:50.084 --> 06:52.614
Yes. sir. They've narrowed it down
to three finalists.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.977
Me. her.

06:55.156 --> 06:57.716
Well. congratulations.
That's quite an honor. isn't it?

you provide here at court.

if you could see your way clear...

07:12.339 --> 07:14.029
...to endorse my candidacy.

I'd be glad to write a letter
of recommendation for both of you.

No.

07:18.879 --> 07:21.249
HARRY: No. what?
-No. sir.

07:21.415 --> 07:23.315
You see. it has to be one or the other.

07:23.483 --> 07:27.753
Otherwise. it's gonna look like a form letter.
and it won't carry any weight with them.

07:27.921 --> 07:29.981
Sir. for once. she's right.

07:30.157 --> 07:32.487
As I see it.
this is an either-or situation.

07:32.659 --> 07:35.559
Her or me.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.927
And may the best man win.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.403
You guys are putting me in a tough spot.

07:42.568 --> 07:45.368
I mean. basically. you're asking me
to choose between you.

07:45.538 --> 07:49.908
Well. Harry. I don't think
that should be so difficult.

07:50.076 --> 07:52.876
Slit skirt. no fair.

07:54.479 --> 07:59.249
The court finds the defendant guilty with a
two-day suspended sentence and a $50 fine.

07:59.417 --> 08:02.547
And. Mr. Conway.
remember that a funeral at St. Pat's...

08:02.721 --> 08:05.251
...is no place for a singing telegram.

a chicken suit in a cathedral.

13:24.299 --> 13:26.729

with the ethics of a dung beetle.

Billie. come on.

13:30.238 --> 13:34.038

13:48.222 --> 13:52.352
There you go again.
throwing your money around.

13:52.526 --> 13:56.186
Sorry. I only wish to know
why you tell me we should talk...

13:56.363 --> 13:57.963
...and then say nothing.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.900
I'm going over my options in my mind.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.587
-Option?
-Yeah.

14:02.767 --> 14:08.927
See. A. you move in with me.
and I owe $18.000...

14:09.107 --> 14:15.267
...B. you don't move in with me.
and I owe $18,000.

14:15.447 --> 14:17.347
-There is no C?
-Uh-huh.

I get hit by a bus. and I die...

14:21.585 --> 14:25.275
...owing $18,000.

14:25.455 --> 14:27.915
It is not you who owes money. Mac.
it is I.

14:28.091 --> 14:29.961
Yeah. but you see. you're my wife.

14:30.126 --> 14:33.386
And the law says what's yours is mine.
and what's mine is yours.

14:35.598 --> 14:36.758

14:37.599 --> 14:39.969
-What?
-I love you. Mac.

14:40.402 --> 14:41.532
Oh. Ouon Le.

14:41.703 --> 14:42.833
And I miss you.

14:43.005 --> 14:45.125
-Ouon Le--
-Yes. Mac?

14:48.210 --> 14:50.300
I missed you too.

14:52.913 --> 14:57.183
I guess I didn't realize how much
until I saw you again tonight.

14:59.353 --> 15:02.753
Come on. let's have some lunch and talk.

15:03.490 --> 15:06.790
-I'll buy.
-Oh. you'll buy?

15:07.794 --> 15:10.534
Don't leave home without it.

15:12.332 --> 15:14.662
I thought it was a law.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.104

MAC: No law.

IKNOCKING ON DOOR]

15:22.142 --> 15:23.412
Yeah. come on in.

15:30.750 --> 15:34.240
You ever see Premature Burial
with Ray Milland?

15:36.055 --> 15:37.415
Billie did that.

15:37.588 --> 15:42.578
I know. I saw her down at the cafeteria
digging timbers out of her fingers.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.990
Bull. I'm telling you. I expected her
to be disappointed by my recommendation...

15:47.165 --> 15:50.685
...but the way she reacted
was just totally off the wall.

15:50.868 --> 15:54.328
-Can I say something off the record?
-Sure.

15:54.806 --> 15:57.066
You're a little dense.

15:58.910 --> 16:01.240
How about we go back on the record?

16:01.412 --> 16:03.002
She thinks you don't like her.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.080
But my not giving her the recommendation
was nothing personal.

16:06.249 --> 16:07.719
Yeah. not to you.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.324
But she wanted you to say.
"You're doing a good job. Billie."

16:11.488 --> 16:15.358
She wanted you to say.
''I like the way you do things."

16:15.525 --> 16:19.455
We all want approval
from somebody we care about and respect.

16:20.597 --> 16:23.397
And. Harry. she cares about you.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.997
And she respects you.

16:27.270 --> 16:28.760
Goodbye.

16:30.674 --> 16:31.704
HARRY:
Bull.

16:32.842 --> 16:34.972
How did you get so smart. anyway?

16:37.713 --> 16:40.743
I've had some rough lessons in life. sir.

16:40.915 --> 16:45.845
And I've used those experiences to learn.
and grow and survive.

16:47.889 --> 16:50.549
But mostly. it's from watching Donahue.

16:54.896 --> 16:56.616
More pickle chips?

16:56.797 --> 17:00.427
No. those soda crackers
filled me right up.

17:00.601 --> 17:03.371
Mac. I am very sorry
I am the cause of all your troubles.

17:03.537 --> 17:05.227
Oh. come on. come on.

17:05.406 --> 17:08.336
You're not the cause of all my troubles.

17:08.509 --> 17:12.499
Although. you've sure helped me
to forget what the others might be.

17:13.012 --> 17:14.412
What's a wife for?

17:14.579 --> 17:16.240
Yeah. right.

17:17.883 --> 17:19.583
Ouon Le.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.920
If we actually live together
as husband and wife--

17:25.357 --> 17:27.587
I said if.

17:28.093 --> 17:30.393
--we'd have lots of problems.

17:30.561 --> 17:32.861
All newlyweds have problem.

17:33.430 --> 17:34.590
Who told you that?

17:34.763 --> 17:35.793
Bull.

17:35.964 --> 17:38.764
A man named Phil told him.

17:39.568 --> 17:41.998
Ouon Le. but we'd have extra problems.

17:42.171 --> 17:45.541
Because even though America
is the land of liberty and all that...

17:45.707 --> 17:49.297
...some people haven't accepted the idea
of two people from different races...

17:49.478 --> 17:51.448
...living together as man and wife.

17:52.214 --> 17:53.944
Can you accept it?

17:54.115 --> 17:57.305
Well. of course I can accept it.
but it's because I love you.

17:58.052 --> 17:59.542
PEOPLE:
Aw.

18:03.023 --> 18:06.653
That is the first time
you said you love me.

18:07.494 --> 18:09.394
Ouon Le...

18:09.663 --> 18:13.103
...there's a chance it could get ugly.

18:13.633 --> 18:15.163
Mac...

18:15.701 --> 18:20.731
...l have lived with war
ever since I was 5 years old.

18:21.574 --> 18:26.344
My home was destroyed.
most of my family were killed.

18:26.712 --> 18:32.082
And I have lived with that horror
every single day of my life.

18:32.885 --> 18:37.405
Tell me. can it get any uglier than that?

18:47.233 --> 18:49.533
I can't stand living in a messy apartment.

18:49.701 --> 18:50.761
Cleaning is my hobby.

18:50.935 --> 18:54.055
Well. not to mention. I like to watch
a lot of sports on TV.

18:54.239 --> 18:56.329
Go. Cubbies.

18:57.909 --> 19:01.809
Plus. I like three eggs scrambled
every day for breakfast.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.240
You have them any way you like.

19:04.415 --> 19:06.675
I don't know how to cook.

19:10.755 --> 19:12.685
Oh. what the hell. Ouon Le.

19:12.857 --> 19:14.587
If you think you can put up with me--

19:14.758 --> 19:15.988
I can put up with you.

19:16.158 --> 19:17.628
Say okaY-

19:22.765 --> 19:24.285
OkaY-

19:24.466 --> 19:26.796
But the first thing we gotta do
when we get home...

19:26.968 --> 19:31.168
...is to sit down and figure out exactly
what that 18.000 bucks went for.

19:31.339 --> 19:33.709
-Agreed.
-Fine.

19:41.316 --> 19:44.176
Did I mention the Buick?

19:52.227 --> 19:53.287
Hi. Billie.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.931
Judge Stone.

19:56.096 --> 19:58.786
Okay. I know you're not too thrilled
with me right now...

19:58.966 --> 20:02.726
...but I'd like to show you
what I have here in my robe.

20:03.504 --> 20:05.564
Don't you dare.

20:07.775 --> 20:10.635
-What is it?
-Sort of a letter of recommendation.

20:10.811 --> 20:12.911
Thought you could take it with you.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.510
Read it.

20:23.424 --> 20:25.294
"To whom it may concern."

20:25.793 --> 20:27.233
I stole that.

20:28.562 --> 20:32.802
"Billie Young is something special."

20:33.233 --> 20:35.333
Why beat around the bush?

20:36.537 --> 20:40.767
"She's got a good head on her shoulders.
but more important. she's got a good heart.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.842
She's earned the respect of her peers
and the affection of friends.

20:45.012 --> 20:49.752
She's a sworn enemy of the smug.
and the callous. and the corrupt.

20:49.917 --> 20:53.847
Because when it comes
to other human beings. she's a lover...

20:54.622 --> 20:57.152
...in the finest sense of the word.

20:58.626 --> 21:00.486
In short...."

21:02.730 --> 21:08.230
In short. the world is a better place
because Billie Young is in it.

21:09.336 --> 21:14.396
Sincerely yours. Judge Harold T. Stone.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.684
Harry. this is lovely.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.270
I don't know how to thank you.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.250
You could start by withdrawing
your application for transfer.

21:30.588 --> 21:33.018
-I never sent it in.
-How come?

21:33.658 --> 21:35.318
I was afraid they'd accept it.

21:38.294 --> 21:41.894
Come on. I'll fix you a Bartini.

21:43.165 --> 21:45.425
Bosco and vermouth.

21:46.101 --> 21:47.501
-You're so crazy.
-Am not.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.000
-Are to.
-Am not.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.071
Hey. Dan.

21:54.242 --> 21:56.942
Pick a card. any card. Aha!

22:02.550 --> 22:06.010
Is it just my imagination.
or are you a little less than chipper?

22:06.187 --> 22:07.657
I just found out it's all over.

22:07.822 --> 22:11.282
They gave my spot on the commission
to the other guy.

22:11.459 --> 22:13.149
What about my recommendation?

22:13.761 --> 22:15.861
Toilet paper.

22:18.499 --> 22:19.799
I've got a friend inside.

22:19.966 --> 22:23.226
He said the board chairman
thought you were too young...

22:23.403 --> 22:26.773
...and far too flaky to be taken seriously.

22:27.507 --> 22:31.097
-You mean. I--?
-Destroyed my career. yes.

22:31.578 --> 22:34.068
Well. we do what we can.

22:34.247 --> 22:38.377
You know. I just can't believe they gave it
to that joker from the Bronx.

22:38.552 --> 22:39.642
MAN:
Dan Fielding?

22:39.820 --> 22:40.840
What?

22:41.021 --> 22:43.151
I'm the joker from the Bronx.

22:45.292 --> 22:47.422
You-- You mean. you--?
Oh. well. Father....

22:49.863 --> 22:51.023
Congratulations.

22:51.197 --> 22:52.427
Thank you.

22:52.597 --> 22:53.997
Where's Ms. Young?

22:54.165 --> 22:56.855
I wanted to congratulate her
on a race well run.

22:57.035 --> 22:58.895
She's well thought of down at city hall.

22:59.070 --> 23:00.270
She's got a big future.

23:00.438 --> 23:02.928
Uh. heh. Well. what about me?

23:03.108 --> 23:08.048
Oh. I heard about you too.
and believe me. I know you're going places.

23:09.481 --> 23:11.211
Think hot.
