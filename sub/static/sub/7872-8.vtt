00:54.755 --> 00:55.988
Moe.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.389
How many times I
got to tell you

00:57.391 --> 00:59.391
not to throw your trash
in my Dumpster?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.193
Oh, come on, Szyslak.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.029
I got to make space in the store
for my new side business--

01:04.031 --> 01:07.533
a tanning salon that secretly
has cameras in the beds,

01:07.535 --> 01:12.037
which feeds into my Web site,
www.tancams.com.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.672
That is registered.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.040
Yeah, sounds great.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.242
Maybe then you could afford
to rent your own Dumpster.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.844
I like my current deal.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.913

I can face that crowd!

10:30.097 --> 10:31.429
(groans)

10:31.431 --> 10:33.264
Buddy, buddy.
Think of it this way:

10:33.266 --> 10:35.934
you're not singing
in front of all those people,

10:35.936 --> 10:37.769
you're alone
at the Kwik-E-Mart

10:37.771 --> 10:39.270
in the middle of the night.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.139
You just wear this onstage,

10:41.141 --> 10:43.241
and everything will be fine.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.010
(gasps)
My uniform!

10:48.648 --> 10:52.651
All alone at the Kwik-E-Mart.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.061
Well, son,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.328
I do have the talent.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.297
My mind is full of ideas

11:39.299 --> 11:41.399
for great songs I could write...

11:41.401 --> 11:43.702
down the names of
and then cover.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.236
But then I remember:

11:45.238 --> 11:48.339
I'm just a regular guy,
jamming with my buds.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.708
Oh, sweetie.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.310
This band has brought out
the best in you.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.180
Yeah, you really get that
it's all about the music.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.314
Yep.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.849
It's all about the music.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.752
And it would take a pretty
unforeseen development

12:00.754 --> 12:02.253
to change that.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.423
Pretty unforeseen...

12:08.160 --> 12:11.963
Gentlemen, I think we've found
what we're looking for.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.602
HOMER:
<i>Guys, I really need</i>
<i>your honesty here.</i>

12:17.604 --> 12:19.738
At the Squidport
Senior Jamboree...

12:19.740 --> 12:22.207
was I too in
the pocket?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.875
(Covercraft members gasp)

12:23.877 --> 12:26.177
KIRK:
Freddy Freeman,
Shredder Stevens,

12:26.179 --> 12:28.880
Nick Delacourt and
Peter D'Abbruzio--

12:28.882 --> 12:32.250
you're four of the five guys
from Sungazer!

12:32.252 --> 12:35.420
But where's your lead
singer, Grant LeDavid?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.055
Uh, he passed away.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.056
How?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.591
(whispering)

12:39.593 --> 12:41.960
What kind of erotic
asphyxiation?

12:41.962 --> 12:42.961
(whispering)

12:42.963 --> 12:44.062
Oh...

12:44.064 --> 12:46.064
Apu, you're
the only man

12:46.066 --> 12:47.432
on the entire
Internet

12:47.434 --> 12:50.101
who's got the pure
Sungazer sound.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.736
Will you be our
new lead singer

12:51.738 --> 12:53.738
and join us on
our stadium tour?

12:53.740 --> 12:54.606
Uh...
Oh!
Ooh.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.275
I think I can
answer for Apu.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.476
He's flattered,

12:58.478 --> 13:00.545
but the small-time
success of Covercraft

13:00.547 --> 13:02.614
is all that any of us
have ever wanted.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.082
Uh, actually, I...

13:04.084 --> 13:07.051
Apu has a rich life
here in Springfield:

13:07.053 --> 13:08.953
a store full of
great products,

13:08.955 --> 13:10.822
a lovely
him-type wife,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.590
and eight super kids:

13:12.592 --> 13:15.660
Anoop, Sandeep,
Nabendu, Gheet,

13:15.662 --> 13:18.329
Pria, Uma,
Poonam, Sashi...

13:18.331 --> 13:19.597
Shut your mouth,
I want to do it!

13:19.599 --> 13:20.765
I want to do it!

13:20.767 --> 13:23.768
I want to be a singer
for a real rock band!

13:23.770 --> 13:24.769
SHREDDER STEVENS:
Sun...

13:24.771 --> 13:26.004
ALL:
...gazer!

13:28.974 --> 13:31.075
Gotta say, I'm
kind of jealous

13:31.077 --> 13:33.077
of Apu getting
a break like that.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.279
Not me.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.814
I'm nothing but happy

13:35.816 --> 13:38.483
that our friend is headed
for fame and fortune.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.985
APU:
Tonight we play Las Vegas--

13:40.987 --> 13:44.155
and the theme of
the casino is circus!

13:44.157 --> 13:45.623
Circus!

13:45.625 --> 13:47.292
Ha!

13:47.294 --> 13:48.660
(whimpers)

13:48.662 --> 13:50.795
I want his fame
and fortune so much!

13:50.797 --> 13:54.299
Why must the Lords
of Rock be so cruel?!

13:54.301 --> 13:56.968
(laughing)

13:56.970 --> 13:58.369
Sammy Hagar?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.038
You're not dead.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.774
Damn it!

14:02.776 --> 14:04.809
I told you those jalapeño
poppers had too much breading!

14:04.811 --> 14:06.344
Sorry,
Señor Hagar.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.012
Nah, nah, nah,
it's cool, man.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.814
I went to rock star heaven.

14:09.816 --> 14:13.685
And there was this great back
patio with this sweet fire pit.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.487
If you had the right
wristband-- which I did.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.755
(laughs)

14:22.027 --> 14:24.162
News story in aisle three?
Local clerk,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.364
<i>Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,</i>

14:26.366 --> 14:29.000
<i>is a dead ringer</i>
<i>for a dead singer.</i>

14:29.002 --> 14:31.302
He's living the rock star dream

14:31.304 --> 14:33.171
<i>as front man for</i>
<i>'80s chart-toppers</i>

14:33.173 --> 14:37.208
<i>Sungazer on their Last Final</i>
<i>Hell Re-Freezes Over</i>

14:37.210 --> 14:39.377
<i>Ultimate Good-bye</i>
<i>For Serious This Time</i>

14:39.379 --> 14:41.846
Never Again Part Two
of Question Mark Tour.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.381
Apu and the band appeared

14:43.383 --> 14:44.716
on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

14:44.718 --> 14:46.317
as the punch line
in a game show sketch.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.685
What's a game show?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.554
Something you make
sketches about.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.222
KENT BROCKMAN:
<i>It looks like Apu</i>
<i>won't be playing</i>

14:51.224 --> 14:54.259
the Cabbage Festival ever again.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.264
Dad, you shouldn't
be jealous of Apu.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.532
Remember, it's all
about the music.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.600
I'm not jealous.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.902
I'm envious.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.169
Jealousy is
when you worry

15:05.171 --> 15:06.604
someone will take
what you have.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.573
Envy is wanting
what someone else has.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.042
What I feel is envy.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.410
Hmm.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.878
Wow, he's
right.

15:13.880 --> 15:14.879
You know what?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.547
Apu leaving is
the best thing

15:16.549 --> 15:17.782
that ever happened
to this band.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.684
We're gonna be
like Genesis

15:19.686 --> 15:21.719
after Peter Gabriel left.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.922
You mean more popular
but not as good?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.624
Phil Collins-era Genesis
is not as good, huh?

15:26.626 --> 15:28.960
"No Reply at All,"
"Land of Confusion,"

15:28.962 --> 15:31.129
"Throwing it All Away,"
"Illegal Alien,"

15:31.131 --> 15:34.732
"I Can't Dance," and I'm sure
I don't need to mention...

15:34.734 --> 15:37.235
"Invisible Touch"!

15:37.237 --> 15:38.303
Hmph!

15:40.873 --> 15:42.373
(Covercraft plays)

15:46.378 --> 15:48.379
(grunts)

15:48.381 --> 15:52.050
You know, we really could
use a new lead singer.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.385
You know, I've been
known to sing a little.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.121
What? So you can also get
famous and bail on us?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.256
You're out of the band!

15:58.258 --> 16:00.658
Well, you can't
just kick him out.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.494
Oh, so you're sticking
up for Yoko here?

16:03.496 --> 16:06.431
Looks like I've got
another Yoko on my hands.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.333
How can there be two Yokos?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.934
Yoko! Yoko!

16:09.936 --> 16:11.269
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!

16:11.271 --> 16:13.771
All you Yokos
are out of the band!

16:13.773 --> 16:15.840
(grumbling)

16:21.914 --> 16:23.181
Are you okay?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.615
Do I sound okay?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.184
You sound great!

16:26.186 --> 16:29.287
Your licks are really... juicy.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.422
They're not juicy.
My licks are dry.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.291
Dry and scratchy
like a cat's tongue.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.792
You didn't join a band

16:34.794 --> 16:37.261
to become famous like
in   <i>Almost Famous.</i>

16:37.263 --> 16:39.297
You loved playing music
with your friends.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.032
That was enough
to make you happy.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.934
Well, it's not enough anymore.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.136
When something great
happens to one person,

16:45.138 --> 16:47.271
everyone else's life
gets a little worse.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.140
Look it up, it's called physics.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.875
Apu is a good man.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.145
He sent over front row tickets
and backstage passes

16:54.147 --> 16:56.481
to his show at
the Costington Center.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.883
Oh, you mean he
generously invited us

16:58.885 --> 17:00.818
to come watch him
be a rock star?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.021
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.323
Your friend had a wonderful
thing happen to him,

17:05.325 --> 17:08.559
and you are coming with us
to share in his talent.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.528
I'll never have
a per diem.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.630
You don't know
what a per diem is.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.731
Still want one.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.035
Hmph.

17:27.312 --> 17:28.379
Hmph.

17:30.482 --> 17:31.549
Hmph.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.553
Apu wouldn't be able
to sing a note

17:35.555 --> 17:37.688
if I didn't help him get
over his stage fright

17:37.690 --> 17:39.557
with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.691
(gasps)

17:40.693 --> 17:42.260
Backstage pass,

17:42.262 --> 17:45.730
you just became
a payback rage pass.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.376
Look at all this rock star
dressing room stuff.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.710
What a sellout.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.112
Cheese plate...

18:01.114 --> 18:03.381
oh, sorry, <i>cubed</i> cheese plate.

18:03.383 --> 18:07.218
Lemon tea, probably
for his throat.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.753
Mm-hmm!

18:09.721 --> 18:11.055
Let's see how he performs

18:11.057 --> 18:12.590
in front of all those people

18:12.592 --> 18:15.626
without his magic-people-
performing-in-front-of shirt.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.196
(door opens, Homer gasps)

18:18.198 --> 18:20.531
But, Mr. Shredder,
you promised me

18:20.533 --> 18:23.101
after we played my hometown
I could have a day off.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.103
I also promised
I'd kick heroin.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.270
Hmm?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.639
But the tour is
so hard on my family.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.108
My octuplets are being raised

18:30.110 --> 18:31.776
by roadies and bodyguards.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.945
This is
not proper.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.113
Look, Apu.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.248
For 25 years
we wasted money

18:37.250 --> 18:38.916
on women, drugs

18:38.918 --> 18:41.252
and guitars with
live fish inside.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.488
And now we want
to keep it going.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.823
You signed a contract
for a three-year,

18:45.825 --> 18:48.559
57-country tour
at union scale--

18:48.561 --> 18:50.128
no per diem.

18:50.130 --> 18:50.928
(gasps softly)

18:50.930 --> 18:52.864
You're in the band.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.468
Oh, well, I guess it's showtime.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.769
(gasps)

18:58.771 --> 18:59.904
Homer?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.139
I'm sorry, Apu.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.573
I thought you were
living your dream life,

19:02.575 --> 19:04.275
so naturally
I wanted to ruin it.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.410
But now I know things stink,

19:06.412 --> 19:08.479
so I'm okay with it.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.914
Oh, what is
the point?

19:09.916 --> 19:12.950
I am trapped like
a Kwik-E-Mart hot
dog on a roller.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.620
Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?

19:15.622 --> 19:17.688
You want every hot dog
in the store?

19:17.690 --> 19:18.923
Every one?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.358
Okay...

19:30.135 --> 19:32.770
Yeah!
Yeah.
Oh!
Yeah!

by a mysterious case

21:09.067 --> 21:10.534
So there I am, on Easter Island,

21:10.536 --> 21:12.603
and the heads ask me
to play them a song.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.572
I say, "Why me, heads?

21:14.574 --> 21:17.074
You've heard the music
of the universe itself."

21:17.076 --> 21:18.476
And they say, "Sammy,

21:18.478 --> 21:20.544
your stuff rocks
just a little harder."

21:20.546 --> 21:22.213
That's when I wake up.

21:22.215 --> 21:24.582
I'm in the Springfield
Elementary parking lot,

21:24.584 --> 21:28.085
doing a buck fifty-five
in my Ferrari 512 Boxer.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.420
I was cornering so hard,

21:29.422 --> 21:31.088
I blacked out
from the Gs, man.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.324
They say I ran over
the groundskeeper.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.092
Probably get life in prison.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.427
But I got a plan to escape,

21:36.429 --> 21:38.095
using only this harmonica

21:38.097 --> 21:40.097
and some guitar picks
with my face on 'em.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.166
Who's with me on this?

21:48.106 --> 21:50.174
(Hagar laughing)
