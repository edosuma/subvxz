WEBVTT

00:01.170 --> 00:03.870
"SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER!"

00:06.384 --> 00:07.584
Wow, can
you believe...

00:07.585 --> 00:09.385
that 4 years has
gone by this fast?

00:11.549 --> 00:12.349
There you go.

00:12.550 --> 00:13.550
Ok.

00:14.091 --> 00:15.791
"To Brendan. A
photographer who could...

00:15.792 --> 00:17.592
always capture
the moment".

00:20.309 --> 00:21.509
Thanks.

00:21.911 --> 00:22.911
Sure.

00:24.513 --> 00:25.713
I gotta run.

00:26.147 --> 00:27.147
See ya.

00:27.737 --> 00:28.737
Hi.
Hi.

00:29.137 --> 00:30.137
See ya at lunch.

01:16.195 --> 01:17.195
Hello?

01:27.912 --> 01:28.912
Hello?

01:51.950 --> 01:53.650
Is anyone in here?

01:54.751 --> 01:55.751
Hello?

02:09.884 --> 02:10.884
Haley?

02:13.733 --> 02:14.710
Oh, thank God,

02:14.710 --> 02:15.710
I don't know
what's going on,

02:15.711 --> 02:17.311
but I think we're the
only two people in...

03:03.108 --> 03:04.108
Oh my God!

03:04.227 --> 03:05.227
What going on?

03:12.721 --> 03:13.721
Help!

03:14.496 --> 03:15.496
Help me!

03:16.571 --> 03:17.571
Help!

03:25.637 --> 03:28.216
4x21 Forever

04:19.901 --> 04:21.901
He's obvious been thinking
about this for a while.

04:23.025 --> 04:25.225
You have to let him make
his own decisions, Jonathan.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.416
Hey.

04:28.617 --> 04:30.417
You mind telling me why
you have a financial aid...

04:30.418 --> 04:32.418
package for
Central Kansas?

04:33.792 --> 04:35.392
That's where
I'm going to college.

04:37.213 --> 04:38.313
What happened
to Met. U.?

04:38.414 --> 04:40.014
What happened
to Ohio,

04:40.015 --> 04:41.315
what happened
to Miami?

04:43.435 --> 04:44.535
I thought I'd stay
closer to home.

04:45.179 --> 04:46.379
Clark...

04:46.380 --> 04:47.980
I know starting over
with new friends...

04:47.981 --> 04:49.881
in a new city can
seem overwhelming,

04:49.882 --> 04:50.882
but...

04:51.183 --> 04:52.683
you can't let
that hold you back.

04:52.966 --> 04:54.487
This is one of the most
important decisions...

04:54.487 --> 04:56.449
you going to make
in your entire life.

04:56.449 --> 04:57.449
You don't think
I know that?

04:59.255 --> 05:01.255
Does Lana happen to be
going to Central Kansas?

05:02.667 --> 05:04.567
I don't know where Lana's
going to school, so no..

05:04.568 --> 05:06.168
this is not
about Lana.

05:06.169 --> 05:07.369
Oh, so it's about us.

05:09.174 --> 05:10.974
You don't think I can run
this farm without your help.

05:13.249 --> 05:14.017
This is where
I'm needed.

05:14.619 --> 05:16.800
Clark, your destiny
lies far beyond...

05:16.801 --> 05:18.228
those corn
fields out there.

05:18.228 --> 05:20.628
And I'm not about to let
you turn your back on that...

05:20.629 --> 05:22.929
just because of us.

05:25.561 --> 05:26.761
Now I've got a
farm to run.

05:31.409 --> 05:32.409
Clark?

05:34.824 --> 05:36.424
Is that really
the reason?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.553
Those tests,
was really hard...

05:54.916 --> 05:56.216
I know, I had formally
badly in that..

05:59.783 --> 06:01.460
Lisa, Delia.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.760
Do you guys know
what's going on?

06:03.219 --> 06:04.219
You better
hurry Chloe,

06:04.220 --> 06:05.221
or you're going to
be late for Trig.

06:05.221 --> 06:06.223
Wait, Trig?

06:06.223 --> 06:08.123
Guys, there's no classrooms
behind these doors!

06:08.340 --> 06:09.540
Just play along.

06:09.923 --> 06:11.123
He's watching.

06:16.916 --> 06:17.916
Brendan, wait!

06:17.917 --> 06:19.017
Don't let the door
shut behind you..

06:19.018 --> 06:19.858
What are you doing!?

06:19.858 --> 06:21.658
Are you playing
along too?

06:21.954 --> 06:22.954
Playing along?

06:23.755 --> 06:24.755
Chloe,
I planned it all.

06:26.563 --> 06:27.633
You brought us here?

06:27.633 --> 06:29.233
Just because it's the
last day of school,

06:29.234 --> 06:31.234
doesn't mean it
can't last forever.

06:32.811 --> 06:34.011
Brendan,
you're not serious.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.167
Why would you wanna
stay stuck in high school...

06:36.167 --> 06:37.867
when there's so
much else out there.

06:38.225 --> 06:40.225
I thought you of all
people would understand.

06:42.011 --> 06:43.311
You're the editor
of the torch,

06:44.054 --> 06:45.154
prom queen,

06:45.604 --> 06:47.104
Chloe, you had
everything in high school.

06:47.743 --> 06:49.543
Once you leave, all
that's going to be left...

06:49.544 --> 06:51.244
is a lifetime of
disappointments.

06:54.408 --> 06:55.708
But not in here.

06:58.102 --> 06:58.802
Brendan,

06:58.803 --> 07:00.203
you cannot keep
us here forever.

07:00.204 --> 07:01.130
You have
to move on.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.130
To what?

07:02.158 --> 07:02.858
Look Chloe,

07:02.858 --> 07:05.261
some of us didn't get into
our dream colleges like you.

07:05.261 --> 07:07.161
When you're staring at
a pile of rejection letters,

07:07.162 --> 07:08.563
moving on really means...

07:08.563 --> 07:10.563
working at a local video
store for the rest of your life.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.283
Oh how can you
be sure the rest of us...

07:12.283 --> 07:14.283
are going to go
along with this?

07:17.730 --> 07:18.730
Wendell?

07:20.157 --> 07:21.157
Wendell.

07:21.158 --> 07:22.158
Come here.

07:23.782 --> 07:24.782
I said come here!

07:27.330 --> 07:28.330
I didn't do anything,

07:28.331 --> 07:29.331
I swear.

07:30.272 --> 07:31.872
Chloe was just wondering
what happens...

07:31.873 --> 07:33.273
when we don't
play along...

07:33.447 --> 07:34.447
No.

07:34.448 --> 07:35.448
No, please.

07:35.897 --> 07:36.752
Wendell.

07:36.752 --> 07:37.752
No I didn't...

07:55.902 --> 07:56.997
It's best
if you realize...

07:56.997 --> 07:58.997
how much better off
you are here, Chloe

08:02.251 --> 08:03.651
I'll save a seat
for you at lunch.

08:26.592 --> 08:27.592
What do you think?

08:29.878 --> 08:31.778
I think it's finally
starting to hit me.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.145
It's truly over, isn't it?

08:36.405 --> 08:37.706
You know I remember
walking through those doors...

08:37.707 --> 08:38.907
the first day of
freshman year.

08:40.712 --> 08:42.114
Actually,

08:42.114 --> 08:43.813
I think you tripped.

08:43.965 --> 08:45.765
Well I couldn't help it,
you made me nervous.

08:46.763 --> 08:47.763
It was cute.

08:49.656 --> 08:50.756
Who knew you'd
turn into this...

08:50.757 --> 08:52.057
big high school
football star.

08:52.885 --> 08:53.785
Former,

08:53.786 --> 08:54.786
football star...

08:57.135 --> 08:58.186
who's gotten used
to seeing you...

08:58.186 --> 09:00.186
every morning
at the lockers.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.408
But I guess that's
all going to change...

09:03.409 --> 09:04.909
now that you're
going off to college.

09:06.532 --> 09:08.032
Well, I don't know
if I'm going to go.

09:10.971 --> 09:11.971
Really?

09:11.972 --> 09:13.272
I mean,

09:14.445 --> 09:15.345
what do you mean,

09:15.346 --> 09:17.246
you're the one that's always
dreamt of leaving this town,

09:17.247 --> 09:18.447
ever since you
were a little girl.

09:18.448 --> 09:19.448
I know,

09:20.138 --> 09:22.138
it's just that right now
I feel I've been making...

09:22.139 --> 09:22.984
that decision
because...

09:22.984 --> 09:25.606
it's what everyone
expects us to do.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.106
If I go, I want to
make that choice...

09:27.107 --> 09:28.507
for the right reasons.

09:28.862 --> 09:29.854
So you're staying.

09:29.854 --> 09:30.854
In Smallville.

09:32.094 --> 09:33.094
I don't know.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.784
I think it would
be really hard...

09:34.792 --> 09:36.792
with all of you
guys gone.

09:37.492 --> 09:38.792
Will not all of us
will be gone.

09:42.108 --> 09:43.908
I'm thinking of commuting
to Central Kansas.

09:48.094 --> 09:49.394
Then maybe I won't have
to spend any more time...

09:49.395 --> 09:51.095
trying to figure out
how to say goodbye.

09:54.364 --> 09:55.564
Wendall Johnson!

09:56.830 --> 09:57.830
Chloe Sullivan!

09:59.083 --> 10:00.083
Haley Timmins!

10:01.388 --> 10:02.388
Delia Watkins!

10:03.139 --> 10:04.339
I would've thought Chloe
would be the first one in line.

10:07.103 --> 10:09.503
LuthorCorp is the legal
conservator of the cave,

10:09.504 --> 10:11.980
we can do any excavation
work we want down there.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.681
I'll have to call
you back.

10:16.629 --> 10:18.229
I thought we had
concluded our business.

10:32.475 --> 10:33.475
Almost..

11:01.071 --> 11:02.871
Clark was going to take
care of that tonight.

11:06.164 --> 11:07.564
It's nothing I can't
handle by myself.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.802
I know what you're
doing Jonathan.

11:10.723 --> 11:12.623
You can't take the place
of Clark on this farm,

11:12.624 --> 11:13.624
no one can.

11:14.146 --> 11:15.758
Every other farm
in the county has...

11:15.758 --> 11:17.847
at least five hands
to help out.

11:17.847 --> 11:18.847
Sweetheart,

11:19.049 --> 11:20.749
my family managed to run
this farm for generations...

11:20.750 --> 11:22.450
before Clark
came around.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.434
I see no reason why
I can't run it by myself.

11:28.686 --> 11:31.186
Sometimes I wonder which
one of you is more stubborn.

11:33.468 --> 11:34.668
Why don't
I give you a clue?

11:42.588 --> 11:44.488
When are you going to
admit that the truth is...

11:44.987 --> 11:46.687
you and I can't run
this place alone?

11:48.642 --> 11:50.942
Martha, what exactly is it
that you want me to do?

11:51.862 --> 11:53.462
You want me to tell
our teenage son...

11:53.814 --> 11:55.614
that we can't possibly survive
around here without him?

11:57.599 --> 11:58.799
What kind of parents
would that make us?

12:00.337 --> 12:01.337
Honest ones.

12:02.459 --> 12:03.759
How many times
has he asked...

12:04.060 --> 12:05.060
be treated like
it to an adult?

12:05.236 --> 12:07.236
This decision took
a lot of maturity.

12:07.549 --> 12:08.549
Or guilt.

12:10.985 --> 12:12.285
Martha, Clark still
feels responsible...

12:12.286 --> 12:13.886
for my heart
problems.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.966
I'm not going to
allow him to do this...

12:15.967 --> 12:16.721
out of pity.

12:16.721 --> 12:18.021
It's not pity,
Jonathan.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.339
Clark knows
that if he leaves...

12:22.340 --> 12:23.840
he can only come back
a few times a year.

12:24.674 --> 12:25.974
And he doesn't want
one of those times...

12:25.975 --> 12:26.975
to be your funeral.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.098
Chloe?

12:52.337 --> 12:53.637
I don't know
if Met. U.'s ready...

12:53.638 --> 12:54.638
for the wall of weird.

12:55.449 --> 12:56.449
She didn't get the
Torch out today.

12:57.130 --> 12:58.330
Maybe the printers
aren't working.

12:58.814 --> 12:59.814
No.

12:59.925 --> 13:01.425
It's not even in
its final format.

13:01.778 --> 13:02.579
There's no way
that Chloe would...

13:02.579 --> 13:03.279
let the last day
of school...

13:03.279 --> 13:04.779
go by without giving
her final word.

13:06.802 --> 13:08.303
And when was the
last time that Chloe...

13:08.303 --> 13:09.003
pulled an all-nighter
with a deadline,

13:09.003 --> 13:10.703
didn't finish her latte?

13:12.845 --> 13:13.945
Or leave without
her lifeline?

13:42.351 --> 13:43.651
I guess I should have
trusted my instincts.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.735
I knew you were
working with Jason.

13:49.085 --> 13:50.685
Judging from
the fact that...

13:50.886 --> 13:52.286
10 minutes ago
I lost all...

13:52.287 --> 13:53.487
feeling in my hands,

13:53.788 --> 13:55.188
you have
a very curious...

13:55.189 --> 13:56.189
definition of...

13:56.190 --> 13:57.490
collaboration, Lex.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.263
Genevieve!

14:08.547 --> 14:09.547
and the dutiful son.

14:10.673 --> 14:13.473
The Oedipal bond
sure has a way of...

14:14.120 --> 14:15.850
flourishing when it's fed,

14:15.850 --> 14:17.550
doesn't it Lex?

14:20.044 --> 14:21.644
Lionel,

14:21.645 --> 14:23.445
the stones may be just
another hobby for you...

14:23.446 --> 14:25.446
but I didn't search
all these years...

14:25.447 --> 14:26.947
just to reach
a stalemate...

14:27.936 --> 14:29.536
You're making a
big mistake Jason.

14:30.158 --> 14:31.258
I know she's
your mother but...

14:31.259 --> 14:33.259
don't think for a second
she won't turn on you.

14:34.516 --> 14:35.616
Trust me on this one.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.667
Jason.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.168
It's okay mother.

14:39.689 --> 14:41.455
I don't expect them
to understand...

14:41.455 --> 14:42.704
the meaning of
family loyalty,

14:42.704 --> 14:44.296
especially when the
only thing running...

14:44.296 --> 14:46.296
through the Luthor
blood is betrayal.

14:48.447 --> 14:50.047
Now we want the
stone you stole from us.

14:51.354 --> 14:52.654
Yes Lex, your father

14:52.655 --> 14:54.155
has one of the stones.

14:59.287 --> 15:00.487
And what do you
want from me?

15:01.047 --> 15:01.848
I have a feeling that
he'd sooner die...

15:01.848 --> 15:04.248
than give up
that stone.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.600
But all that
might change...

15:07.590 --> 15:08.690
if his own flesh
and blood...

15:08.691 --> 15:10.291
were at stake.

15:11.407 --> 15:14.207
You obviously don't know
my father as well as I do.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.297
I hope for your sake...

15:25.298 --> 15:26.298
you're wrong.

15:31.119 --> 15:32.319
I've got a couple
of cappuccinos...

15:32.512 --> 15:33.512
and a double espresso.

15:34.713 --> 15:35.513
Where you're..

15:35.831 --> 15:36.831
There we go.
Thank you.

15:40.619 --> 15:41.688
I'm impressed,
"Smallville".

15:41.688 --> 15:43.388
Of all the seniors
skipping...

15:43.389 --> 15:44.336
the last day of school,

15:44.336 --> 15:45.336
I didn't expect
to see you.

15:45.660 --> 15:46.660
I'm on lunch break.

15:48.423 --> 15:49.423
Right, right,

15:49.954 --> 15:51.154
because why would
you do anything...

15:51.155 --> 15:53.055
like any other normal
teenager in America.

15:54.739 --> 15:56.539
The last day of school is
a "get out of jail free" card.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.400
Even my best
employee Haley...

15:58.501 --> 15:59.501
flaked on her
morning shift.

15:59.802 --> 16:01.302
I'm here looking for Chloe,
have you seen her?

16:01.603 --> 16:03.703
After my 2 A.M. java run
to the Torch last night...

16:03.704 --> 16:05.304
so that she could
make her deadline.

16:05.305 --> 16:06.700
I'm guessing she's
crashed out somewhere.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.500
Lois, she never
published the last issue.

16:09.745 --> 16:10.894
It's kind of why I think
something is going on.

16:10.894 --> 16:11.994
Um, Clark?

16:12.971 --> 16:14.471
Could you sign
my yearbook?

16:14.918 --> 16:15.918
Yeah!

16:22.907 --> 16:24.607
Is this the girl who didn't
show up to work today?

16:25.430 --> 16:26.930
"Most Likely to be a
Shark's Cheerleader"?

16:27.719 --> 16:28.919
Yeah, that's our girl.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.489
Thanks.

16:32.038 --> 16:33.038
Listen,

16:33.039 --> 16:34.539
Wendall, Haley,
Chloe, and Delia.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.640
They didn't pick up their
graduation robes today.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.716
Not your "Most Likely
to Ditch" crowd,

16:38.716 --> 16:39.641
you think something's
happened to them?

16:39.641 --> 16:40.641
I don't know.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.742
Anything seem weird last
night when you left Chloe?

16:43.294 --> 16:45.194
No, she was just swarming
through a pile of photos...

16:45.195 --> 16:46.695
with some
photographer kid.

17:22.711 --> 17:23.711
Hi.

17:23.712 --> 17:24.712
Hey,

17:24.949 --> 17:26.148
Didn't mean to
scare you there.

17:26.150 --> 17:27.349
It's ok.

17:27.864 --> 17:29.664
Just wondering if you'd
sign my yearbook actually.

17:31.179 --> 17:32.279
Sure.

17:32.872 --> 17:35.272
"Most Likely to be
a Cover Girl".

17:36.043 --> 17:37.667
I think the
photographer...

17:37.667 --> 17:39.667
had something
to do with this!

17:40.173 --> 17:41.196
Thanks.

17:41.196 --> 17:42.896
Of course a photograph
could never...

17:42.897 --> 17:44.497
take the place of
the real thing, right?

18:01.110 --> 18:02.610
Chloe,

18:05.010 --> 18:06.110
You better
get to class.

18:06.111 --> 18:07.411
The bells going
to ring soon.

18:08.177 --> 18:09.177
You don't want
to be late.

18:10.737 --> 18:12.037
I'll be right there.

18:17.668 --> 18:18.768
Brendan!

18:19.809 --> 18:20.909
What are you
two talking about?

18:22.209 --> 18:23.835
We were just planning
a study session...

18:23.835 --> 18:25.835
for Mr. Kramer's quiz.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.394
I have a
surprise for you.

18:52.915 --> 18:54.016
If you ask me,

18:54.016 --> 18:55.916
"Most Likely to be a Cover
Girl" is selling her short.

18:57.878 --> 18:59.178
But at least you'll have
a friend in here with you.

19:13.343 --> 19:14.343
Chloe, what's
going on?

19:14.552 --> 19:16.152
Chloe,

19:16.486 --> 19:18.186
I'm going to let you
tell Lana the rules.

19:20.022 --> 19:21.422
Okay!
Great!

19:25.612 --> 19:27.012
How did I end up
back in school?

19:27.436 --> 19:29.236
Okay, don't wig out..

19:29.237 --> 19:30.637
We're not in school.

19:32.633 --> 19:33.633
Why are you
acting like this?

19:36.670 --> 19:37.770
He's watching.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.863
Brendan, A.K.A.,

19:45.377 --> 19:47.377
Mr. Medusa's touch,

19:47.743 --> 19:49.243
re-created this place.

19:49.943 --> 19:51.243
It's kind of
like a cage.

19:52.251 --> 19:53.951
Gives new meaning
to the phrase...

19:54.529 --> 19:56.050
"capturing the
moment", doesn't it?

19:56.050 --> 19:57.250
But how...

19:58.705 --> 19:59.905
The last thing
I remember...

19:59.906 --> 20:01.706
is signing his yearbook.

20:10.974 --> 20:12.174
Lana...

20:12.375 --> 20:13.375
will you sign
my yearbook?

20:13.376 --> 20:14.376
Okay.

20:14.523 --> 20:15.723
Look at the names.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.536
I seriously doubt it's
just a coincidence...

20:17.536 --> 20:18.864
that the slumber
party's guest list...

20:18.864 --> 20:22.003
is all on the "most
likely to... " page.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.003
We have
been collected!

20:26.945 --> 20:27.945
Hey guys!

20:29.769 --> 20:31.569
I told Brendan you
had a crush on him...

20:31.570 --> 20:32.770
like he wanted me to.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.798
What are you
guys talking about?

20:36.498 --> 20:37.598
Brendan wants
high school?

20:39.041 --> 20:40.341
We'll give him
high school.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.150
Where is...

21:00.551 --> 21:01.551
the stone?

21:05.633 --> 21:06.633
God!

21:06.792 --> 21:08.192
Lionel, Lex is your son.

21:09.594 --> 21:11.194
And despite what you
want him to believe,

21:11.195 --> 21:13.395
I know you don't want
to watch him die.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.076
Jason, darling...

21:31.852 --> 21:33.152
Oh, God!

21:41.533 --> 21:42.933
Stop!
Stop it!

21:44.396 --> 21:45.396
Where is it?

21:45.665 --> 21:46.665
I gave it to Lana!

21:46.679 --> 21:48.279
Lana doesn't know
anything about this.

21:48.919 --> 21:50.716
You wouldn't have trusted
anything that valuable to her.

21:50.716 --> 21:51.916
I gave it to her for
the same reason...

21:51.917 --> 21:53.617
that I gave her that
map to the temple.

21:53.762 --> 21:55.462
She is the chosen one,
and we all know that!

21:58.926 --> 22:00.126
Jason...

22:01.815 --> 22:03.015
I'll take care of Lana.

22:06.872 --> 22:09.072
You promised me
you wouldn't hurt her.

22:09.514 --> 22:11.214
Has she ever
shown any gratitude?

22:12.512 --> 22:14.356
Lana has no idea
how much...

22:14.356 --> 22:15.950
you've been
protecting her.

22:15.950 --> 22:16.950
And for what?

22:18.195 --> 22:20.195
For her to choose
Clark over you?

22:25.588 --> 22:26.888
You know,

22:27.124 --> 22:29.624
I would never betray
you the way she has.

22:42.215 --> 22:43.815
I wouldn't underestimate
her, Genevieve.

22:44.744 --> 22:46.344
Don't forget...

22:46.545 --> 22:47.745
Lana Lang's ancestor...

22:47.874 --> 22:50.474
pledged that she would
revenge your family.

22:52.774 --> 22:54.774
I would leave folklore in the
past if I were you, Lionel.

22:56.788 --> 22:59.288
My ancestors burn
traitors at the stake.

23:04.230 --> 23:06.030
Let's hope you're
not one of them.

23:16.821 --> 23:17.921
Brendan?

23:18.590 --> 23:19.690
He's got to be in here,

23:19.691 --> 23:20.686
it's like his
second home.

23:21.021 --> 23:23.021
Just like Chloe should
be at the Torch.

23:23.109 --> 23:25.209
This whole
"10 Little Indians" thing,

23:25.210 --> 23:26.910
it's starting to
give me the creeps.

23:28.588 --> 23:29.788
Popular guy.

23:29.789 --> 23:31.189
Cheerleaders,

23:31.661 --> 23:32.661
alternate girls,

23:33.406 --> 23:34.406
jocks.

23:34.794 --> 23:35.994
Brendan knows
everyone.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.240
It's sort of like
your fast track...

23:38.241 --> 23:39.441
to the front page
of the torch.

23:43.049 --> 23:44.449
That's a little
"Norman Bates".

23:46.709 --> 23:48.709
It's everyone from the
"Most Likely... " list.

23:55.431 --> 23:56.431
Lana?

23:56.452 --> 23:57.852
Oh God, do you
think they're...?

23:57.853 --> 23:58.853
No!

24:00.314 --> 24:01.488
It seems more
like a collection,

24:01.488 --> 24:03.488
like he's keeping
them somewhere.

24:07.639 --> 24:09.039
Lois, check this out.

24:09.937 --> 24:10.937
Oh,

24:10.938 --> 24:11.938
thanks Clark.

24:18.808 --> 24:20.408
It's like they're his paper
dolls, or something.

24:22.442 --> 24:23.742
Except these
blueprints are to scale.

24:26.276 --> 24:28.376
Must have rebuilt this part
of the school somewhere.

24:29.523 --> 24:30.723
Nash Construction.

24:38.809 --> 24:39.809
Hey!

24:39.937 --> 24:41.828
It's amazing how
much material...

24:41.828 --> 24:43.837
we have for tomorrow's
issue already.

24:43.837 --> 24:44.538
Well,

24:44.538 --> 24:46.000
I want to make sure you
have some great shots...

24:46.000 --> 24:47.500
to work with.

24:48.266 --> 24:49.366
You know,

24:49.580 --> 24:50.880
it's funny.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.481
Four years in
school together,

24:53.482 --> 24:54.682
and I had no idea...

24:54.683 --> 24:56.283
that you and Haley
were such good friends.

24:57.024 --> 24:58.224
Why?

24:58.225 --> 24:59.225
What did she tell you?

24:59.489 --> 25:01.389
Nothing I didn't
suspect already.

25:03.357 --> 25:04.357
You know,

25:04.458 --> 25:05.958
the more I
think about it,

25:05.987 --> 25:07.087
the more I
can't believe...

25:07.088 --> 25:08.888
you re-created
this whole place...

25:08.930 --> 25:09.930
for all of us.

25:10.228 --> 25:11.428
After I got those
rejection letters,

25:12.745 --> 25:14.546
I realized I spend
so much time...

25:14.546 --> 25:16.646
proving myself
in the end...

25:16.898 --> 25:18.898
and none of it
mattered on the outside.

25:19.332 --> 25:21.932
And we have to do
it all again if we left.

25:22.976 --> 25:24.176
So,

25:24.177 --> 25:25.177
how'd you do it?

25:25.905 --> 25:27.205
I told my dad...

25:27.206 --> 25:28.363
if he didn't do it,

25:28.363 --> 25:30.164
I turned my own
annoying step-monster...

25:30.164 --> 25:32.264
into his own
personal mannequin.

25:32.679 --> 25:35.279
You should have seen
the look on her face,

25:35.280 --> 25:37.680
it was just...

25:43.818 --> 25:45.018
Let's go.

25:47.761 --> 25:49.161
Please, get us
out of here!

26:03.114 --> 26:04.814
You shouldn't have tried
to get away, Haley.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.198
I thought you felt
the same way...

26:15.198 --> 26:16.349
I did about
our future.

26:16.349 --> 26:18.249
Brendan, you can't
keep us here forever.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.413
You have to let us go.

26:19.413 --> 26:20.813
I don't think you
really want that.

26:21.918 --> 26:23.618
I know you'll
like it here.

26:23.675 --> 26:25.475
Or you'll end up like
your friend Haley.

26:45.325 --> 26:47.425
I don't blame you for getting
caught up in all this Jason.

26:49.214 --> 26:50.914
Your mother...

26:51.315 --> 26:53.215
she's a difficult
woman to resist.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.580
Though you were
suppose to...

26:58.281 --> 27:00.182
get close to
Lana but..

27:02.579 --> 27:03.579
What happened,
did you...

27:03.580 --> 27:06.080
stray a little too far from
those apron strings?

27:12.924 --> 27:15.024
You know, with
all your resources,

27:16.225 --> 27:18.025
would've thought by now
you'd know that Lana...

27:18.026 --> 27:19.826
is nothing more than
my mother's pawn.

27:19.827 --> 27:20.827
Pawn?

27:21.164 --> 27:22.364
Well that's true but,

27:22.765 --> 27:24.465
upon you fell
in love with.

27:25.684 --> 27:26.884
It must be killing
you that you've...

27:27.085 --> 27:28.885
sacrificed...

27:29.103 --> 27:30.203
your feelings for Lana...

27:30.204 --> 27:32.204
in exchange for some...

27:32.905 --> 27:34.105
maternal warmth...

27:36.305 --> 27:37.905
it seems you
can't do without.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.520
Makes us look like the
Waltons, doesn't it?

27:57.274 --> 27:59.074
I'm sorry..

27:59.175 --> 28:00.775
Lex, I got you
involved in all this.

28:01.546 --> 28:03.746
You may not
believe me but I,

28:03.747 --> 28:05.947
truly wish I were
here alone.

28:06.887 --> 28:08.187
To be honest dad,

28:08.360 --> 28:09.560
I'm glad you're
here with me.

28:12.199 --> 28:13.699
Now knock that
iron out of the fire,

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
and get it as close to
my chair as you can.

29:25.236 --> 29:26.436
We have to split up.

29:27.779 --> 29:28.779
Go!

30:32.570 --> 30:33.570
Wait Lex,

30:33.571 --> 30:34.571
don't do this,
don't do this!

30:35.121 --> 30:36.621
Come on,
look at me.

30:36.722 --> 30:37.822
You and I, we're
not that different.

30:37.823 --> 30:39.059
It was never about
you and me,

30:39.059 --> 30:39.824
it was about our
parents, please!

30:39.824 --> 30:40.544
Lex please!

30:40.544 --> 30:42.400
I always knew I had to
protect Lana from you!

30:42.491 --> 30:43.438
But not as much as
you've been protecting...

30:43.438 --> 30:44.792
your best friend, huh?

30:44.792 --> 30:45.792
Ah.. Clark?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.728
Clark doesn't have
anything to do with this!

30:49.074 --> 30:50.274
Oh you don't
believe that.

30:50.275 --> 30:52.275
Clark's more connected
to this than any of us.

30:52.581 --> 30:54.381
You just choose to ignore it.
I mean, think about it...

30:54.382 --> 30:56.382
the symbols burned
into the kid's barn?

30:56.383 --> 30:57.383
The fields?

30:59.053 --> 31:00.120
It's a little late and
obvious to the...

31:00.120 --> 31:02.072
shifting the blame
in the 11th hour.

31:02.072 --> 31:04.272
Why can't you see what's
right in front of your face, Lex?

31:05.312 --> 31:06.112
It's Clark.

31:06.113 --> 31:07.113
He's..

31:30.360 --> 31:31.360
He was...

31:31.661 --> 31:32.661
about to kill you, Lex.

31:35.951 --> 31:37.251
Or divulge something...

31:37.252 --> 31:38.852
you didn't want
me to know.

31:39.674 --> 31:41.374
Lex, you saved my
life back there.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.692
I was returning
the favor son.

31:45.252 --> 31:46.252
I had no choice.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.471
I know you
have the stone.

31:50.558 --> 31:51.858
If anything
happens to Lana...

31:53.173 --> 31:55.473
you'll be begging for
an end like that.

32:10.622 --> 32:11.922
How cliché,

32:11.923 --> 32:13.323
an abandoned
warehouse.

32:15.487 --> 32:16.487
Oh great.

32:20.344 --> 32:21.786
You know maybe
there's another way in...

32:21.786 --> 32:23.123
around the corner.

32:23.123 --> 32:24.323
Why don't
you go check,

32:24.324 --> 32:25.624
I'll see if I can find
the key for this lock.

32:25.968 --> 32:26.697
Keys?

32:26.697 --> 32:29.197
I highly doubt they're under
the welcome that, but...

32:29.850 --> 32:30.950
you knock
yourself out.

33:26.920 --> 33:27.920
Chloe.

33:41.863 --> 33:43.063
Chloe?

34:29.933 --> 34:31.033
Brendan.

34:32.347 --> 34:33.282
You have to
release everybody.

34:33.282 --> 34:35.882
I wanted you to be
a part of all this Clark.

34:36.389 --> 34:38.089
But you guys...

34:38.090 --> 34:40.090
you guys had no
right coming here!

34:40.168 --> 34:41.768
You have to
let them go.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.369
Things change.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.170
No matter how much
we don't want them to.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.500
We can't live in
high school forever.

34:48.047 --> 34:49.246
You don't really
want that.

34:50.657 --> 34:51.657
Clark...

34:52.033 --> 34:53.132
think about it.

34:54.387 --> 34:55.786
She could stay
like this forever.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.760
Always be with you.

34:58.116 --> 35:00.216
You wouldn't be afraid
if she ever left you.

35:00.404 --> 35:01.704
I'm not afraid of
that, Brendan.

35:02.005 --> 35:03.667
You should be.

35:04.219 --> 35:05.719
She'll leave you, Clark.

35:06.492 --> 35:07.892
She might never
come back.

35:08.762 --> 35:10.262
If you really
care about her,

35:12.315 --> 35:14.115
you'll do anything you
can to keep her.

35:15.481 --> 35:16.681
Let her go!

35:21.436 --> 35:22.436
What's...
happening...?

35:25.542 --> 35:26.542
No! Just...
stop!

35:27.987 --> 35:29.387
They're going
to find out...

35:29.588 --> 35:31.088
what it's like to
lose someone...

35:31.689 --> 35:32.689
forever.

35:35.075 --> 35:36.075
No!

35:59.402 --> 36:00.602
Clark...

36:10.812 --> 36:11.912
Lois!

36:11.913 --> 36:12.913
Hey.

36:12.914 --> 36:13.914
My God...

36:40.353 --> 36:42.253
Wow, I haven't
seen you use that...

36:42.254 --> 36:43.854
thing in a long time,

36:43.907 --> 36:45.807
I thought maybe
you'd outgrown it.

36:48.052 --> 36:48.852
Dad I think..

36:48.853 --> 36:49.853
I think..

36:55.083 --> 36:56.083
Clark...

36:59.360 --> 37:00.435
The time comes in
everybody's life...

37:00.435 --> 37:01.340
when they realize...

37:01.340 --> 37:03.758
their parents aren't going
to be around forever.

37:03.758 --> 37:04.650
Dad, I...

37:04.650 --> 37:05.950
Clark, I just..

37:06.774 --> 37:09.774
I just don't want you
sacrificing your potential...

37:09.775 --> 37:10.575
because of me.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.176
It's not a
sacrifice dad,

37:13.005 --> 37:14.005
it's a choice.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.170
It's a really fine line,
don't you think?

37:23.728 --> 37:26.228
Dad, I get the feeling we
could talk about this all night,

37:26.229 --> 37:27.229
and you're still not
going to understand.

37:28.353 --> 37:30.153
Oh, I understand a whole
lot more than you think.

37:30.154 --> 37:31.025
Right.

37:31.025 --> 37:32.725
That's why you came up
here to change my mind.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.369
Dad, you raised me to
make my own decisions.

37:36.370 --> 37:37.970
Why don't you
trust me on this?

37:43.497 --> 37:44.797
Because you are
a lot like me.

37:45.535 --> 37:47.428
I have a full ride
to Met. U. waiting...

37:47.428 --> 37:49.641
for me when
I graduated.

37:49.641 --> 37:52.441
Problem is, my father
needed me on this farm.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.150
So I stayed.

38:00.962 --> 38:03.362
Dad that's a pretty big
footnote to leave out.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.382
Why didn't
you tell me?

38:07.296 --> 38:08.796
I didn't want it
to weigh you down.

38:12.842 --> 38:15.442
As much as I loved
my father, I..

38:16.627 --> 38:19.427
a part of me still resents him
for needing me that much.

38:20.645 --> 38:22.145
I don't want you
to feel that.

38:22.283 --> 38:23.883
That's not the
kind of father I..

38:25.198 --> 38:26.298
I ever wanted to be.

38:34.405 --> 38:35.705
Dad.

38:38.611 --> 38:40.611
This isn't about the
kind of father you are.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.524
It's about the kind of
son I want to be.

40:11.746 --> 40:12.546
Hey.

40:13.947 --> 40:14.947
Thank you.

40:16.272 --> 40:17.572
So I guess this
is it, huh?

40:20.969 --> 40:22.869
It's not like we're never going
to see each other, right?

40:23.093 --> 40:26.593
Yeah, you'll have..
summers and holidays.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.085
This sucks!

40:32.992 --> 40:33.992
Big time.

40:35.484 --> 40:37.584
Suddenly, all those tests
and teachers we hated.

40:37.785 --> 40:39.417
Seem a lot less scary than
the big question mark...

40:39.417 --> 40:41.417
that's hanging out there.

40:44.028 --> 40:45.628
You'd think after everything
that happened to Brendan,

40:45.629 --> 40:48.529
it'd be a whole lot easier
to say goodbye to all this.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.914
There's a lot here
to say goodbye to.

40:52.597 --> 40:54.798
You know, not to go all
"psycho-sympathizer" guys,

40:54.798 --> 40:55.498
but I...

40:55.498 --> 40:57.031
can't blame Brendan
for wanting...

40:57.031 --> 40:58.676
to keep
everybody together.

40:58.676 --> 41:01.576
Although, after
that little lock-in...

41:01.577 --> 41:02.597
I can't think of
anything scarier...

41:02.597 --> 41:03.678
than being stuck
in the past...

41:03.678 --> 41:04.678
and not moving on.

41:10.730 --> 41:12.330
Wait a minute, Lana...

41:13.131 --> 41:15.631
Did you say I'll have
summers and holidays?

41:16.104 --> 41:17.374
What about you?

41:17.374 --> 41:18.574
I'm staying
in Smallville.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.704
I thought you said
you weren't sure.

41:24.984 --> 41:27.084
Don't you wanna see
what else is out there?

41:27.720 --> 41:30.120
Well that's exactly why
I went to Paris last year,

41:30.121 --> 41:31.121
but...

41:31.122 --> 41:32.922
there's a reason that
I was drawn back home.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.867
I'm just not sure that I've
explored all the possibilities...

41:37.868 --> 41:38.868
here.

41:53.205 --> 41:55.005
Maybe things won't
change much after all...
