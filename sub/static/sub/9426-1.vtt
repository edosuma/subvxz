02:42.501 --> 02:43.626
<i>More than a thousand years ago,</i>

02:44.459 --> 02:47.876
<i>China broke into three kingdoms at war.</i>

02:49.042 --> 02:50.376
<i>Food became the paramount necessity.</i>

02:51.209 --> 02:53.584
<i>To feed his soldiers,</i>

02:54.084 --> 02:56.542
<i>one emperor invented 'Mojin Xiaowei'</i>

02:57.751 --> 02:59.251
<i>They are official tomb robbers</i>

02:59.959 --> 03:02.042
<i>borrowing gold from the dead...</i>

03:02.417 --> 03:06.584
<i>for the livings.</i>

03:20.751 --> 03:24.042
<i>They have strict rules to follow:</i>

03:24.376 --> 03:27.917
<i>Before a coffin is opened</i>

03:28.417 --> 03:29.751
<i>a candle must be lit at
the southeast corner</i>

03:30.001 --> 03:31.209
<i>If the candle goes out</i>

03:31.501 --> 03:35.584
<i>the Mojins must return
the treasures and leave the tomb.</i>

03:37.417 --> 03:40.084
<i>Or else there would be catastrophes.</i>

03:44.542 --> 03:47.084
<i>To escape the deadly traps is
no more than a piece of cake...</i>

03:47.334 --> 03:50.417
<i>for the Mojins.</i>

05:06.876 --> 05:08.042
Candles are dimming out.

05:09.209 --> 05:09.792
Leave it!

05:12.459 --> 05:13.376
Wait.

05:14.209 --> 05:16.542
We've been out of business for months!

05:17.667 --> 05:20.167
We can't let this treasure slip!

05:21.834 --> 05:22.584
Hu Bayi!

06:17.209 --> 06:18.917
<i>1988, Mojin Xiaoweis retired
from tomb raiding</i>

06:19.042 --> 06:20.376
<i>and fled to New York
in Shirley's demand.</i>

06:20.959 --> 06:22.834
Hi girl, come on.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.126
Look at me. Look at me.

06:25.792 --> 06:27.667
Chinese treasures!

06:27.792 --> 06:28.542
You see see.

06:28.792 --> 06:29.167
What do you think?

06:29.292 --> 06:31.167
Do you like my babes?

06:33.501 --> 06:34.251
Treasures!

06:34.417 --> 06:35.126
Culture!

06:35.251 --> 06:35.917
Luck!

06:36.126 --> 06:37.751
Good Luck. Really?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.167
Who I am?

06:42.001 --> 06:43.042
Who he is?

06:43.209 --> 06:44.667
We are 'Mojin Xiaowei', you know?

06:44.792 --> 06:46.292
Kung Fu! You know? Kung Fu!

06:50.292 --> 06:51.251
Very Great.

06:51.751 --> 06:53.084
If your Kung Fu's so great

06:53.209 --> 06:54.792
why are you doin' business on the street?

06:56.251 --> 06:57.917
They say America is sick!

06:58.376 --> 06:59.126
Wang

07:00.126 --> 07:01.292
Something's wrong here.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.042
One sec, almost there.

07:03.376 --> 07:04.459
Show me your ID.

07:05.251 --> 07:05.667
What?

07:06.167 --> 07:07.126
This is the INS.

07:07.334 --> 07:08.751
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

07:10.417 --> 07:12.167
Sorry I...I don't know English...

07:12.417 --> 07:13.167
What is your name?

07:13.417 --> 07:14.251
Where are you from?

07:14.709 --> 07:15.084
Hey!

07:15.876 --> 07:16.584
We have ID.

07:16.876 --> 07:17.542
ID!

07:18.251 --> 07:19.334
ID!

07:20.376 --> 07:20.959
Ah..ID!

07:21.084 --> 07:21.792
I know I know I know...

07:25.417 --> 07:25.917
Run!!!

07:26.834 --> 07:27.376
Run!!!

07:28.334 --> 07:28.834
This is Officer Durham.
We are chasing two Asian men...

07:28.959 --> 07:29.792
Where to?

07:30.084 --> 07:32.251
To seek the Dragon through obstacles,
each obstacle is a gate

07:32.376 --> 07:34.292
Left to Broadway, right to Central Street.

07:34.417 --> 07:35.917
Up instead of down, left instead of right.

07:36.042 --> 07:36.751
Shut up!

07:36.876 --> 07:37.459
Left or right?

07:37.584 --> 07:38.251
Left!

07:38.667 --> 07:40.459
I knew there was
something wrong with her.

07:40.584 --> 07:41.209
Watch out!

07:43.584 --> 07:45.417
Dragon Seeking doesn't work here.

07:45.917 --> 07:46.334
Go!

07:48.876 --> 07:49.417
Get in !

07:49.584 --> 07:50.459
Yang!

07:54.917 --> 07:55.959
You guys go first
and I take care of the rest.

07:56.917 --> 07:57.501
What?

07:57.626 --> 07:58.834
The rest?
You'd better take care of yourself.

07:59.167 --> 08:00.084
There!

08:34.708 --> 08:36.126
We are the "Mojin Xiaowei".

08:36.751 --> 08:39.083
But here we are chased
on the streets all the time.

08:41.958 --> 08:43.083
What the fuck!

08:43.292 --> 08:44.751
I'd rather be sent back to China

08:46.959 --> 08:48.251
What the hell is this country.

08:48.709 --> 08:49.751
I can't find you anywhere.

08:50.417 --> 08:51.167
Are you hiding from me?

08:52.251 --> 08:53.001
No way.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.001
Why would I hide from you?

08:57.917 --> 08:59.084
Mom told me,

08:59.501 --> 09:00.959
if you have slept with a man

09:01.084 --> 09:02.167
never contact him first.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.376
Wait for him to come to you.

09:06.417 --> 09:07.584
My mom also told me,

09:09.626 --> 09:11.626
If he doesn't

09:12.959 --> 09:13.709
forget about him.

09:16.084 --> 09:18.042
What a cool mom.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.459
You don't need to hide.

09:24.084 --> 09:26.292
Let's just pretend nothing had happened.

09:27.459 --> 09:28.084
Yeah!

09:29.417 --> 09:30.959
That was that I said.

09:31.501 --> 09:33.167
We were so drunk.

09:33.876 --> 09:35.292
I slept with the toilet the whole night.

09:35.417 --> 09:35.792
Ah.

09:36.459 --> 09:37.584
Drunk like that,

09:37.709 --> 09:39.042
You two would have regretted

09:39.251 --> 09:41.542
Whatever you've done.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.084
He's talking about us quitting.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.542
Of course.

09:48.251 --> 09:49.251
What else would I talk about?

09:49.501 --> 09:50.667
A couple of shots down
and we were finished.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.292
We've been raiding all our lives

09:52.751 --> 09:54.459
how can we just quit?

09:54.584 --> 09:55.459
Are you kidding me?

09:55.584 --> 09:55.959
Well,

09:56.417 --> 09:57.459
that's already decided.

09:57.834 --> 09:58.626
period.

10:08.376 --> 10:09.542
How about getting married?

10:13.376 --> 10:14.251
I mean fake marriage.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.084
Then you could get the green card.

10:18.376 --> 10:21.209
And find a proper job...

10:26.584 --> 10:27.917
A Mojin Xiaowei

10:28.042 --> 10:30.126
has to rely on fake
marriage to get a job...

10:31.917 --> 10:33.751
Why not be a hooker?

10:35.376 --> 10:36.209
If the master had known this,

10:36.334 --> 10:38.251
he'd crawl out from the grave
to beat you up.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.126
Stop talking about "Mojin Xiaowei."

10:40.584 --> 10:43.292
We've made the vow to quit

10:43.417 --> 10:44.584
There's no way around

10:45.501 --> 10:47.501
I...I was drunk...

10:47.834 --> 10:49.001
I...I don't remember anything.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.042
I don't.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.917
You irresponsible men!

10:54.792 --> 10:58.126
We gotta be responsible
for our profession first.

10:59.209 --> 11:03.542
He passed the Mojin Amulet
on to us with his expectations.

11:04.209 --> 11:05.459
And here we are.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.251
Grill just got us a big deal.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.751
Let's get back to the business

11:14.959 --> 11:16.834
and leave this 'sick America.'

11:17.584 --> 11:18.042
Yo?

11:23.126 --> 11:24.084
What are you doing.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.167
Hu Bayi!

11:37.792 --> 11:39.417
The wold won't stop because of you.

11:51.876 --> 11:52.709
You

11:53.334 --> 11:54.917
Have a carefully look

11:55.376 --> 11:58.834
These are the treasures from
the tomb of Empress Dowger Cixi.

11:59.751 --> 12:03.917
Mojin Xiaoweis risked their lives
to dig out this pearl out of her mouth.

12:04.251 --> 12:07.959
It absorbed the essence of the nature
to preserve her body from decay.

12:08.084 --> 12:11.792
This pearl's from Chinese
most famous woman's tomb.

12:11.917 --> 12:12.751
Very good.

12:15.459 --> 12:16.792
You are a true expert.

12:17.251 --> 12:19.709
A mediocre piece won't get your attention.

12:19.917 --> 12:21.042
You surely heard of the Emperor of Qin.

12:21.334 --> 12:23.209
The first emperor of China.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.917
His tomb was also raided by the Mojins.

12:26.126 --> 12:28.459
This piece is the greatest among the all.

12:29.126 --> 12:31.459
The Skeleton Mirror.

12:31.584 --> 12:36.667
"...tomb, very very good.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.167
Look who's here!

12:38.292 --> 12:40.459
I would like to proudly present

12:41.126 --> 12:42.751
this gentleman,

12:42.917 --> 12:45.876
who is none other than
the legendary Emperor Weiwu's

12:46.376 --> 12:48.584
eighty-second generation
of Mojin Xiaowei,

12:48.709 --> 12:49.917
the No.one of tombraiders

12:50.042 --> 12:51.876
Mr. Wang Kaixuan.

12:53.376 --> 12:54.292
Where is Mr. Hu?

12:55.459 --> 12:57.792
Fuck that bastard!

12:57.917 --> 12:58.709
Well...

12:59.542 --> 13:00.542
Come and see ! Come come!

13:01.209 --> 13:01.876
Come come!

13:02.959 --> 13:03.584
Look, look.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.667
This is the legendary Mojin Amulet,

13:06.792 --> 13:10.042
The signature of a real Mojin Xiaowei.

13:10.209 --> 13:11.667
Mr. Kai

13:12.542 --> 13:14.417
What's going on?

13:14.542 --> 13:15.834
Come and sit here.

13:16.167 --> 13:16.876
Hello.

13:17.751 --> 13:21.126
I'm the Executive director
of Global Mining Co, Mark.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.876
Miss Yoko is our president's secretary.

13:24.626 --> 13:28.501
Our president Madam Ying Caihong is
very interested in ancient Chinese culture.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.959
She rates highly of
the skills of Mojin Xiaowei.

13:32.251 --> 13:35.167
And is expecting your assistance

13:35.292 --> 13:36.626
regardless of cost.

13:37.084 --> 13:37.584
No.

13:38.292 --> 13:39.834
If so,

13:39.959 --> 13:41.751
I'd say that at least

13:42.334 --> 13:43.251
five...

13:44.209 --> 13:45.417
...hundred thousand dollars.

13:45.792 --> 13:46.501
No problem.

13:48.292 --> 13:48.917
Let's make it a deal.

13:49.126 --> 13:50.459
Here is the information
of the tomb and our contract.

13:50.584 --> 13:51.542
I'll sign the contract.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.542
What contact?

13:53.667 --> 13:54.626
What the hell are you doing?

13:54.751 --> 13:55.959
It's been so many years

13:56.084 --> 13:56.959
Mr. Kai.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.292
Mojins as a team;
United we stand, divided we fall.

14:00.751 --> 14:03.751
Hu Bayi, son of a bitch, has betrayed us!

14:04.584 --> 14:06.501
It doesn't matter if we have money.

14:06.626 --> 14:07.417
So let's do it.

14:10.542 --> 14:11.584
Let me suggest something

14:12.751 --> 14:14.334
for the sake of your sincerity

14:15.542 --> 14:16.584
Another fifty thousand.

14:18.251 --> 14:20.584
What? Thirty thousand?

14:20.876 --> 14:22.126
No way!

14:22.251 --> 14:23.126
You misunderstood.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.751
She means she'll triple your offer.

14:26.251 --> 14:27.667
Far enough for people like you.

14:28.459 --> 14:29.001
Sign the contract then.

14:29.126 --> 14:29.667
Oh Yeah.

14:32.376 --> 14:33.376
Fuck off.

14:33.542 --> 14:34.251
You got money huh ?

14:34.376 --> 14:35.292
Cash or check?

14:35.417 --> 14:36.501
You think you are something?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.542
Fuck you people who think
money can buy everything.

14:41.459 --> 14:41.917
Mr. Kai!

14:43.084 --> 14:46.251
You wanna buy me out with money?

14:46.917 --> 14:48.334
Let me tell you, no bloody way.

14:49.292 --> 14:52.251
I am Wang Kaixuan, Mr. Kai!

15:15.084 --> 15:16.209
Why are you sleeping in the tent?

15:16.334 --> 15:17.251
Weirdo.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.876
According to Fengshui

15:21.001 --> 15:22.084
today

15:23.001 --> 15:26.126
today is not a good day

15:26.251 --> 15:28.084
for trade

15:28.459 --> 15:31.709
or marriage...

15:31.834 --> 15:32.501
Enough!

15:32.709 --> 15:34.001
No one wants to marry you.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.542
I was planning
to see you after I woke up...

15:37.959 --> 15:39.251
and discuss about us...

15:39.626 --> 15:41.251
What about us?

15:41.376 --> 15:42.917
Your attitude already made the conclusion.

15:43.751 --> 15:44.751
You are allowed to regret.

15:47.751 --> 15:48.584
I don't regret it.

15:53.542 --> 15:54.167
So?

15:55.376 --> 15:55.876
Yeah?

15:57.292 --> 15:58.251
So what?

16:02.626 --> 16:04.167
I'm not here to argue with you.

16:04.334 --> 16:05.876
You have something delivered to my place.

16:06.251 --> 16:06.917
Ah.

16:16.251 --> 16:18.001
This is the last time I pick it up for you.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.667
Next time I'll leave it at the door.
You go get it.

16:20.792 --> 16:21.209
Hey...

16:21.459 --> 16:22.042
Take it easy...

16:23.251 --> 16:24.209
If you leave us alone

16:24.959 --> 16:26.709
we'll be in a mess.

16:29.626 --> 16:29.959
Ciao.

16:30.084 --> 16:30.501
Hey!

16:30.626 --> 16:32.292
Just wanna tell you that I'm back to China.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.751
Not because of you.
I don't have time for the argument.

16:35.751 --> 16:37.126
I'm going to check out this tomb
from Liao Dynasty.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.959
It has nothing to do with money,
and I didn't mean to tell you this...

16:41.084 --> 16:42.334
Yeah, right.

16:43.542 --> 16:44.417
But the Equinox flower...

16:45.292 --> 16:46.459
You do remember this flower right?

16:47.084 --> 16:49.084
The special kind of lily
mentioned by Ding appears again.

16:50.251 --> 16:51.917
This time I came back tor Ding.

16:52.751 --> 16:54.001
I need to find out what's going on.

16:55.792 --> 16:56.834
It's up to you to join me or not.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.292
Going back to old business again.

17:00.209 --> 17:02.251
And now he's trying to drag you into this

17:03.751 --> 17:05.501
by sending this inveracious tape.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.084
No.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.209
Wang would never use Ding Sitian

17:11.584 --> 17:12.751
as the bait.

17:22.001 --> 17:23.291
Who's Ding Sitian?

17:28.959 --> 17:31.792
<i>1969, Inner Mongolia, China</i>

17:31.917 --> 17:32.751
<i>Twenty years ago,</i>

17:33.459 --> 17:35.834
<i>Wang and I relocated ourselves
in Inner Mongolia</i>

17:36.209 --> 17:37.584
<i>for 'Up to the Mountains
and Down to the countryside'.</i>

17:38.584 --> 17:39.334
<i>That summer</i>

17:40.084 --> 17:41.959
<i>we marched into the forbidden area led</i>

17:42.292 --> 17:43.417
<i>by the herdsmen,</i>

17:43.626 --> 17:45.751
<i>searching for the thousand year
Goddess tomb, to destroy</i>

17:45.876 --> 17:46.834
<i>the 'Four-olds'.</i>

17:48.917 --> 17:50.334
<i>Ding Sitian was our comrade</i>

17:51.126 --> 17:52.917
<i>her parents were
both renowned botanists.</i>

17:54.042 --> 17:57.292
<i>Ding was talented in music and art.</i>

17:59.959 --> 18:05.459
<i>Thousands of red hearts facing Beijing</i>

18:05.626 --> 18:11.042
<i>Thousands of smiling faces
greeting the red sun</i>

18:11.167 --> 18:16.334
<i>in praise of Long Life for Chairman Mao</i>

18:16.917 --> 18:22.292
<i>Dear Chairman Mao...</i>

18:31.251 --> 18:32.542
Ah!

18:33.292 --> 18:34.084
What's the matter?

18:41.042 --> 18:42.251
You stay put and don't move!

18:42.834 --> 18:43.709
The wheel is stuck!

18:43.917 --> 18:45.042
What should we do?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.167
Don't panic! Everybody push, hurry!

18:49.709 --> 18:50.584
Ding, come.

18:51.292 --> 18:52.126
It's okay. I can to it.

18:57.251 --> 18:59.084
You haven't finished
your flower collection yet right?

18:59.584 --> 19:01.834
Let me know If you are missing
any and I'll find it for you.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.667
Leave all the hard work to Wang,
he can surely handle it.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.042
He can climb up to the moon
and dive down to the ocean.

19:07.167 --> 19:09.584
While we sing and dance on the ground.

19:10.001 --> 19:10.542
I'll stay with you

19:10.959 --> 19:12.459
Hey Hey!

19:12.917 --> 19:14.334
'It's not difficult
to commit some misdeeds.

19:14.459 --> 19:16.959
But it's difficult to commit only misdeeds
and no good deeds,' said Chairman Mao.

19:17.084 --> 19:17.959
He meant exactly you.

19:18.084 --> 19:18.959
Attention!

19:20.709 --> 19:21.459
What happened?

19:21.667 --> 19:23.084
Be alarmed, enemy ahead!

19:23.417 --> 19:24.626
Get your weapons, hurry!

19:24.876 --> 19:25.834
Come and take this!

19:26.584 --> 19:26.917
Go!

19:27.251 --> 19:28.334
Ding,don't worry.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.126
Hey!

19:31.251 --> 19:32.001
Take a look there.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.042
Watch out the mud.

19:34.709 --> 19:37.626
They are enemies?

19:38.084 --> 19:38.876
They're only statues.

19:39.251 --> 19:40.251
More over there!

19:40.376 --> 19:41.001
And here!

19:41.292 --> 19:42.042
There too!

19:44.917 --> 19:47.376
Don't get closer.

19:47.709 --> 19:48.501
Why?

19:50.626 --> 19:53.626
...guarded by the stones...
blessed by the Goddess...

19:53.876 --> 19:54.584
What's he saying?

19:56.501 --> 19:59.584
He says that we've arrived
to the limbo of life and death.

20:00.084 --> 20:01.751
These are the guards of the Underworld.

20:02.417 --> 20:03.542
We must go no further
or else none will return.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.584
You know this shit.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.084
What's going on here?

20:12.667 --> 20:14.417
This area is indeed strange.

20:14.542 --> 20:15.667
Throughout the history
we working class people

20:15.917 --> 20:17.251
would always break
the emperors' tombs for revolutions!

20:17.376 --> 20:17.917
True!

20:18.042 --> 20:18.959
Indeed!

20:19.084 --> 20:21.876
It shows the determinations
against the feudal power!

20:22.001 --> 20:23.751
Hold on, hold on!

20:23.917 --> 20:24.459
Hold on!

20:25.959 --> 20:27.334
The Great Chairman Mao said

20:27.501 --> 20:29.626
All power can be united
must be united, right?

20:29.751 --> 20:30.542
Right!

20:31.084 --> 20:31.626
Look!

20:32.042 --> 20:35.376
These soldiers were
the proletarians of the old days!

20:35.959 --> 20:36.584
Shouldn't we

20:36.751 --> 20:37.959
unite them too?

20:38.084 --> 20:38.542
You got a point.

20:38.959 --> 20:39.584
Bullshit.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.334
All counter-reactionaries
must be abolished.

20:41.459 --> 20:44.209
Excuse us to disturb you...Excuse us...

20:44.334 --> 20:46.959
Only the greatest ambitions
and sacrifice lead to a brave new world!

20:47.084 --> 20:47.834
A brave new world!

20:47.959 --> 20:49.084
Let's destroy the statues!

20:49.209 --> 20:50.001
Destroy them!

20:50.959 --> 20:51.834
Harder!

20:51.959 --> 20:55.334
Through all hardship victory will be ours!

21:01.501 --> 21:05.417
Comrades, this is a
great victory of the people!

21:05.542 --> 21:07.126
Great victory!

21:07.584 --> 21:10.917
Now let's go and destroy
the tomb of the Goddess!

21:11.376 --> 21:12.417
They've gone mad

21:25.876 --> 21:26.376
What's the matter?

21:27.084 --> 21:27.667
Something's wrong.

21:28.417 --> 21:28.959
Hold on.

21:29.084 --> 21:30.084
Attention.

21:30.542 --> 21:31.209
Watch out everybody!

21:32.084 --> 21:33.084
Something's moving underground.

21:47.251 --> 21:49.626
Shut up you superstitious
counterrevolutionary two-faces.

21:52.084 --> 21:52.626
Oh my god...

21:53.167 --> 21:54.167
Get Ding out of there!

21:54.417 --> 21:55.751
Run! This way!

21:56.501 --> 21:57.751
Run! Run!

21:58.709 --> 22:00.292
This way!

22:00.417 --> 22:01.251
Run!

22:02.376 --> 22:03.459
You are all the paper tigers!

22:20.501 --> 22:21.834
Hurry up!

22:27.292 --> 22:28.167
Get down!

22:32.709 --> 22:33.042
Go!

22:37.417 --> 22:38.001
Quickly!

22:39.584 --> 22:39.917
Hurry up!

22:43.251 --> 22:43.709
Ding!

22:46.542 --> 22:47.084
Wang!

22:51.626 --> 22:52.917
Hu, come here!

22:54.376 --> 22:54.876
Go!

22:56.917 --> 22:57.751
Come here quickly!

22:57.876 --> 22:58.584
Here!

23:01.292 --> 23:01.876
Inside!

23:02.917 --> 23:03.542
Cover it!

23:19.917 --> 23:23.251
We've lost so many comrades.

23:26.376 --> 23:31.251
What do we do now?

23:35.292 --> 23:37.292
It's okay.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.501
There's always something.

23:50.084 --> 23:50.709
Stay calm.

23:51.042 --> 23:52.417
Stay calm.

23:53.417 --> 23:54.917
Wang! Wang!

23:57.042 --> 23:57.792
Here's a door.

24:00.751 --> 24:01.751
Where is this place?

24:04.292 --> 24:04.917
Be careful.

24:12.084 --> 24:12.459
Follow up!

24:14.417 --> 24:15.417
What the hell is this place?

24:16.501 --> 24:17.126
It's so deep.

24:18.001 --> 24:19.001
Watch out the steps.

24:43.084 --> 24:44.084
Is this the way out?

24:46.501 --> 24:47.084
It's okay...

24:47.584 --> 24:48.209
Where is this place?

24:51.917 --> 24:53.501
It's huge here...

24:54.251 --> 24:55.126
Look around

24:55.584 --> 24:56.376
Find a way out.

24:57.501 --> 24:58.459
Follow me. Don't be afraid.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.251
Okay.

25:11.542 --> 25:12.542
Here's a dead end.

25:13.001 --> 25:13.501
Wang.

25:14.626 --> 25:16.876
It looks like a Japanese
underground military base.

25:17.334 --> 25:17.501
Ah?

25:17.626 --> 25:18.376
Military base?

25:19.042 --> 25:20.209
Tunnel for war.

25:20.834 --> 25:24.417
There. You lead the way,
I bring up the rear.

25:25.417 --> 25:26.084
Power distribution room.

25:27.751 --> 25:28.584
Ammunition depot.

25:29.667 --> 25:30.501
You follow Hu.

25:31.751 --> 25:32.876
Un...underground base...

25:33.417 --> 25:35.376
Hope there's no Japanese here...

25:35.626 --> 25:37.209
Come on. They are all dead.

25:37.501 --> 25:38.459
Don't scare yourself.

25:38.584 --> 25:39.917
I mean...

25:42.709 --> 25:43.334
Dynamite!

26:04.542 --> 26:07.667
This looks like a dumbwaiter.

26:08.542 --> 26:09.667
A dumbwaiter!

26:09.792 --> 26:10.751
We can get out from here!

26:10.917 --> 26:11.626
Yeah!!

26:11.751 --> 26:13.542
Is't still working?

26:17.001 --> 26:17.917
What's this?

26:19.626 --> 26:20.751
Here's another ammunition depot.

26:21.376 --> 26:22.167
Put it out!

26:22.959 --> 26:23.751
Everybody watch out.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.251
There are dynamite attached to
all the structural joints

26:26.584 --> 26:28.542
Once lit up, the entire base will collapse.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.084
Let's just leave one torch for the road.

26:30.209 --> 26:31.626
Hurry up! Put it out!

26:31.876 --> 26:35.209
We'd better think about
how to re-start the dumbwaiter.

26:36.084 --> 26:37.584
Look, here are the wires!

26:38.042 --> 26:39.834
They would lead us
to the power generator.

26:40.792 --> 26:41.917
Let's have a look.

26:43.376 --> 26:44.667
Come on!

27:04.084 --> 27:04.584
It's on!

27:07.751 --> 27:08.542
Yes!

27:09.959 --> 27:10.626
Great!

27:11.876 --> 27:12.376
It's on!

27:12.667 --> 27:13.542
We can get out!

27:14.417 --> 27:14.959
Let's go.

27:17.251 --> 27:17.834
Don't be afraid.

27:18.042 --> 27:19.251
It's okay. It's okay.

27:20.167 --> 27:20.584
You see,

27:21.334 --> 27:23.251
A dried corpse.

27:24.042 --> 27:24.417
It's okay.

27:31.376 --> 27:33.501
God... It's full of corpses.

27:34.334 --> 27:37.251
How come these Japanese died here?

27:38.042 --> 27:39.334
Look they all carry guns.

27:47.209 --> 27:50.542
Statues over there!

27:50.667 --> 27:51.667
We should go back.

27:52.001 --> 27:53.584
Yeah it's dangerous there.
We'd better go back.

27:53.709 --> 27:54.251
Let's go back.

27:54.917 --> 27:57.126
Let's not get ourselves in trouble.

27:57.251 --> 27:58.167
Let's go.

27:58.292 --> 27:59.001
Yeah, let's go.

27:59.334 --> 27:59.751
What are you all afraid of?

28:00.626 --> 28:01.917
We are materialists.

28:02.251 --> 28:05.126
True materialists are fearless.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.834
Take out your little red book.

28:07.084 --> 28:07.584
Quickly!

28:08.917 --> 28:09.667
Take it out!

28:10.417 --> 28:13.917
True materialists are fearless.

28:15.001 --> 28:18.251
True materialists are fearless.

28:18.376 --> 28:21.292
True materialists are fearless.

28:21.417 --> 28:24.251
Let's smash the "Four olds."

28:25.751 --> 28:27.167
These Japanese all dead in strange ways.

28:28.417 --> 28:29.626
It seems that they found these statues

28:31.084 --> 28:31.667
and tried to move them away.

28:33.084 --> 28:34.042
Then Something happened.

28:36.167 --> 28:37.459
<i>Whatever these 'F our-ems' are,</i>

28:37.584 --> 28:40.084
They are for us proletarians.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.584
Not for the Japanese invaders!

28:46.542 --> 28:47.042
Take it.

28:47.667 --> 28:48.209
For self defense!

28:48.584 --> 28:49.001
Okay.

28:53.751 --> 28:54.917
Don't worry, I'm protecting you.

28:55.251 --> 28:55.834
Thank you.

28:57.959 --> 28:58.376
Let's go.

29:01.126 --> 29:01.917
The Equinox flower!

29:02.126 --> 29:02.626
What?

29:02.876 --> 29:05.542
According to the legend, it only
exists at the limbo of Yin and Yang,

29:05.709 --> 29:08.084
and connect the living and the dead.

29:08.626 --> 29:09.417
The Equinox flower?

29:10.584 --> 29:12.251
Yes, I heard the flower's so beautiful.

29:12.917 --> 29:13.417
Yeah?

29:13.917 --> 29:15.292
I really want to see it.

29:17.084 --> 29:18.584
Count it on me!

29:19.209 --> 29:19.584
Really?

29:20.959 --> 29:22.542
I'll find it for you

29:22.667 --> 29:23.917
even it's in hell.

29:24.376 --> 29:25.126
You promise.

29:26.334 --> 29:27.959
There are still many 'Four-olds'

29:28.084 --> 29:29.376
to be destroyed.

29:29.751 --> 29:31.167
Comrades, let's go!

29:31.292 --> 29:31.834
Go!

29:31.959 --> 29:32.834
It's dangerous!

29:34.751 --> 29:35.376
Hold on!

29:44.292 --> 29:45.667
It's huge.

29:46.959 --> 29:47.584
God damn it!

29:48.417 --> 29:50.334
It'll take us forever to destroy them all.

29:52.126 --> 29:54.751
Comrades, let's do it!

29:54.959 --> 29:55.876
Don't!

29:56.251 --> 29:56.834
Stop it!

30:18.834 --> 30:19.251
What's wrong?

30:19.376 --> 30:19.709
The Japanese!

30:20.292 --> 30:21.251
What the hell is that?

30:36.417 --> 30:37.084
Help!

30:44.626 --> 30:45.292
Come down!

30:47.251 --> 30:47.959
Go!

30:53.834 --> 30:54.334
Careful!

30:55.334 --> 30:55.667
Go

30:55.792 --> 30:56.376
Ding!

31:04.292 --> 31:04.751
Get out!

31:06.042 --> 31:06.542
Fuck off!

31:19.376 --> 31:20.251
Hu Bayi!

31:22.001 --> 31:22.751
Let me go.

31:24.751 --> 31:25.376
Ding!

31:35.376 --> 31:35.959
Wang!

31:38.751 --> 31:39.751
Wang Hurry up!

31:43.709 --> 31:44.167
Go!

31:44.292 --> 31:44.959
Damn it!

31:47.126 --> 31:47.667
Run!

32:06.626 --> 32:07.709
It exploded.

32:09.501 --> 32:11.751
The place was turned into a sea of fire.

32:13.251 --> 32:14.751
We ran for our lives,

32:16.251 --> 32:19.376
Ding Sitian and our comrades all died...

32:20.376 --> 32:21.417
Only Wang and myself

32:22.167 --> 32:24.292
managed to escape by the dumbwaiter.

32:50.084 --> 32:50.917
It's been twenty years.

32:52.584 --> 32:54.834
Wang never wanted to bring this up.

33:02.751 --> 33:04.376
At that time we saw the Equinox flower.

33:05.459 --> 33:09.084
I've heard that it's the sign
of Princess Augo from Khitan.

33:11.084 --> 33:11.876
I never expect that

33:13.959 --> 33:15.084
it would appear again.

33:18.167 --> 33:22.542
You said that you witnessed
the corpses coming back to life

33:22.834 --> 33:24.042
to kill you...

33:25.001 --> 33:26.209
It's impossible.

33:27.626 --> 33:28.417
In hindsight

33:30.709 --> 33:31.584
it was indeed impossible.

33:38.042 --> 33:39.167
It's just that moment

33:41.417 --> 33:42.584
was too real to me.

33:44.042 --> 33:46.542
Perhaps it was just an illusion.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.292
But my comrades did die,

33:49.667 --> 33:52.584
and nearly did Wang and I.

33:54.126 --> 33:55.751
Maybe it was because of the

33:56.709 --> 33:58.334
lack of oxygen

33:58.751 --> 34:01.209
or that you breathed in some toxic gas

34:01.667 --> 34:04.376
that you saw
some unexplainable phenomena?

34:07.167 --> 34:08.958
You know that seeing is not believing.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.417
What you believe to be true
is not determined by your eyes

34:10.917 --> 34:12.167
but your brain.

34:17.501 --> 34:18.708
I know what you mean.

34:20.542 --> 34:21.751
I think that you are pretty

34:23.001 --> 34:24.708
doesn't mean you are physically pretty

34:26.042 --> 34:28.417
but my brain believed that you're pretty...

34:29.751 --> 34:30.251
Right?

34:32.833 --> 34:33.417
What do you want.

34:38.583 --> 34:40.042
I can't leave Wang alone.

34:40.167 --> 34:42.376
You've already quit.

34:43.333 --> 34:44.251
Don't take me wrong.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.917
I'm not gonna go back to the 'business'.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.251
I just wanna get Wang back.

34:49.376 --> 34:50.126
By yourself?

34:50.917 --> 34:51.501
Yeah.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.376
I'm not gonna rob the tomb anyway.

34:56.583 --> 34:57.459
I can do it myself.

34:57.584 --> 34:58.584
I'll be back once I find him.

34:58.751 --> 34:59.709
Don't you worry.

35:00.709 --> 35:02.584
It doesn't matter if you come back or not.

35:02.751 --> 35:03.834
I don't give a shit!

35:05.917 --> 35:06.417
Shirley!

35:07.876 --> 35:09.167
Shirley!

35:17.376 --> 35:19.084
You fucking liar Hu Bayi!!

35:20.042 --> 35:21.376
I knew you!

35:21.917 --> 35:23.376
What you've said has
nothing to do with what you've done!

35:23.751 --> 35:24.792
I'll never trust you anymore!

35:24.917 --> 35:27.251
You fucking arrogant egoistic asshole!

35:27.584 --> 35:29.834
You and Wang Kaixuan together
are nothing but troubles.

35:30.292 --> 35:31.376
Show me

35:31.501 --> 35:33.417
How much trouble you can make!

35:44.417 --> 35:46.792
The long journey
I've been through is still there

35:48.167 --> 35:49.792
And now I am coming back to the start.

35:50.126 --> 35:52.126
Wang Kaixuan is back!

35:52.751 --> 35:55.417
We've been on the horse the whole day,

35:56.417 --> 35:58.251
Man I'm exhausted.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.251
I'm never gonna come to
this god damn shit hole

36:02.376 --> 36:03.959
if not for the dollars.

36:04.084 --> 36:05.626
Watch your mouth.

36:05.792 --> 36:08.167
Hu and I spent our youth here.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.542
Well you brought him,

36:11.126 --> 36:12.584
I didn't.

36:13.251 --> 36:15.917
Screw him

36:16.709 --> 36:18.334
Such a loser who

36:18.459 --> 36:19.917
'can't withstand the sugar-coated bullets.

36:20.042 --> 36:22.209
Subverted by the female agent of
the American Imperialism in a blink.

36:23.417 --> 36:27.292
This world has changed now
- 'women hold up half the sky.'

36:27.834 --> 36:30.751
or more than half! Look at that chick!

36:33.126 --> 36:36.209
Is this a mining company
or a tomb developing company?

36:36.376 --> 36:38.334
This is sick.

36:42.376 --> 36:44.917
We have rented 200 square miles
of this land

36:45.042 --> 36:47.042
for geological prospecting.

36:47.167 --> 36:49.542
It's all yours.

37:07.251 --> 37:07.667
This

37:07.792 --> 37:10.709
is our President Ms. Ying Caihong.

37:11.292 --> 37:12.584
That's the president?

37:15.126 --> 37:16.501
Some sort Yoga class?

37:17.917 --> 37:20.251
What a company!

37:20.376 --> 37:21.417
Mojin Xiaowei is here.

37:21.542 --> 37:22.751
Cool, isn't it!

37:32.959 --> 37:33.459
Wrong again.

37:33.917 --> 37:34.459
It's rock.

37:36.417 --> 37:38.084
I got too excited

37:38.334 --> 37:39.751
following my instinct.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.042
We were looking for the Goddess Tomb.

37:42.167 --> 37:43.834
But we got the dragon tomb haha.

37:43.959 --> 37:46.626
This is the ninth hole,
are you doing this right?

37:46.751 --> 37:49.001
You should blame Hu Bayi.

37:50.209 --> 37:51.959
Locating has always been his thing.

37:52.084 --> 37:53.209
We would have already
found it if he's here.

37:53.334 --> 37:55.209
It's no use to complain now.

37:55.709 --> 37:57.917
They are gonna blow us instead
if we can't find it.

37:58.751 --> 38:00.792
Ask them not to waste my time.

38:01.334 --> 38:02.251
Fuck.

38:04.459 --> 38:07.376
It's been ages and we still got nothing.

38:07.792 --> 38:11.001
This 'Mojin Xiaowei' is a faker, isn't he.

38:12.292 --> 38:14.501
Hey,young lady

38:14.959 --> 38:16.084
trust me.

38:16.417 --> 38:17.709
'Fen Jin Ding Xue' takes time.

38:17.834 --> 38:20.209
It's a serious job.

38:20.876 --> 38:21.834
Fen jin' means to locate

38:22.042 --> 38:23.626
using ancient compass.

38:23.751 --> 38:26.751
The compass divides into 360 degrees,

38:26.917 --> 38:28.667
24 zones.

38:28.792 --> 38:31.209
Each zone breaks further into five golds,

38:31.334 --> 38:33.417
making a total of 120 golds.

38:33.667 --> 38:36.959
We take all the geological positions

38:37.084 --> 38:38.501
into account...

38:38.792 --> 38:39.959
Speak Chinese.

38:41.376 --> 38:44.001
Speak it in technology terms

38:44.126 --> 38:45.334
If 'Fen jin' is the data,

38:45.459 --> 38:46.917
'Dragon Seeking' would be the programme.

38:47.042 --> 38:49.084
The way the programme works
with the data is 'ding xue'.

38:49.876 --> 38:51.834
Once it's done,

38:51.959 --> 38:53.417
all the tombs in this area will be found.

38:53.876 --> 38:54.792
Do you know what I mean?

38:57.792 --> 38:58.459
Ouch!

38:58.667 --> 39:00.459
What do you want young lady?

39:00.876 --> 39:03.709
Show me your gills.

39:04.459 --> 39:05.084
Yo!

39:05.959 --> 39:07.084
Leave him alone!

39:08.417 --> 39:09.084
From now on,

39:09.292 --> 39:11.417
I will pull one tooth out
every time you get it wrong

39:11.584 --> 39:12.834
till you find get it right.

39:13.042 --> 39:14.667
If there's nothing found by dawn,

39:14.792 --> 39:15.917
I shall execute the breaching of terms.

39:16.084 --> 39:17.126
What breaching of terms?

39:18.584 --> 39:23.334
One hole for each of you.

39:25.876 --> 39:28.417
Grill, is that true?

39:30.917 --> 39:32.667
Ahhhh!

39:33.876 --> 39:35.292
What kind of damn contract is that?

39:36.834 --> 39:37.667
Cheers.

39:39.042 --> 39:40.584
Calm down,

39:41.709 --> 39:42.876
It's just a fuckin tomb...

39:48.959 --> 39:50.251
Ding...

40:06.876 --> 40:07.876
That's it!

40:08.209 --> 40:09.292
There! Must be something!

40:12.251 --> 40:15.292
Drunkard's song in Mongolian

40:15.417 --> 40:17.917
Drunkard's song in Mongolian

40:18.667 --> 40:22.584
It's nice for you to be here.

40:23.334 --> 40:25.251
But this time we can't afford to have
all of us trapped here.

40:25.959 --> 40:29.126
Or else it's gonna be
the same all over again.

40:29.292 --> 40:31.792
Mojin Xiaowei,
United we stand, divided we fall.

40:32.251 --> 40:34.876
It's what the master told us. I must come.

40:35.459 --> 40:38.709
These people are not regular graverobbers.

40:39.834 --> 40:43.167
I've checked upon this Global Mining Group.

40:43.917 --> 40:47.167
It's more of a cult than a company.

40:47.542 --> 40:48.501
The tomb of Princess Aogu

40:48.626 --> 40:50.167
you mentioned before is
exactly what they are looking for.

40:50.292 --> 40:51.126
Interesting.

40:51.251 --> 40:53.834
She has double identities:

40:53.959 --> 40:55.167
a royal blood and shaman,

40:55.417 --> 40:56.876
worshipped as a Goddess,

40:57.584 --> 40:59.042
The Equinox flower is her instrument.

40:59.417 --> 41:01.667
Legends tell the flower opens the gate

41:01.792 --> 41:03.542
to the underworld.

41:03.751 --> 41:05.376
It brings the dead back to life.

41:09.626 --> 41:11.209
This guy is too drunk to drive.

41:11.667 --> 41:12.376
Don't worry.

41:12.542 --> 41:13.542
The locals are all like this

41:13.709 --> 41:14.917
the more they drink the better they drive.

41:15.959 --> 41:18.501
A little bit more,
I can take you both high up to the sky.

41:21.584 --> 41:22.001
Are you okay?

41:22.126 --> 41:22.834
You drive the car.

41:23.667 --> 41:25.084
Hey bro, let me drive.

41:25.459 --> 41:27.626
Just sit back and relax.

41:28.042 --> 41:29.751
We are almost there.

41:29.959 --> 41:30.792
Almost!

41:33.459 --> 41:34.042
Take the Break!

41:34.334 --> 41:36.167
It's not working!

41:36.292 --> 41:36.834
Make a turn!

41:37.376 --> 41:38.251
Oh my god we are gonna hit the horses.

41:39.626 --> 41:40.167
Let go!

41:41.167 --> 41:42.209
Let it go!

41:42.667 --> 41:43.792
Oh shit...

41:44.084 --> 41:44.959
Hu Bayi!

41:45.917 --> 41:47.084
Forgive me.

41:58.126 --> 42:02.376
Buddha, God, Save me!

42:06.334 --> 42:08.376
It's deep down here,

42:08.584 --> 42:09.292
looks like a it's leading to the tomb

42:10.417 --> 42:11.126
You see see,

42:11.251 --> 42:13.417
Who's the faker hum?!

42:14.584 --> 42:16.167
Mr. Wang, we got it!

42:16.292 --> 42:20.834
Very impressive. Though you've blown

42:20.959 --> 42:22.542
this prairie into the surface of the moon.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.667
Serious business takes time.

42:24.792 --> 42:26.542
Take it easy.

42:27.167 --> 42:28.709
It's no use educating the ignorant.

42:28.834 --> 42:30.292
But the ignorant needs to be educated!

42:35.834 --> 42:37.751
You shouldn't drink and drive...

42:38.959 --> 42:40.167
(Mongolian)

42:42.667 --> 42:44.501
Thank god there's nothing serious.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.501
After you get there,

42:49.292 --> 42:51.834
take off the bridle
and put it on the saddle.

42:52.292 --> 42:53.459
Can the horse find its way back?

42:53.584 --> 42:55.501
Of course.

42:56.084 --> 42:56.626
Thank you.

42:56.751 --> 42:57.959
Cheers,

43:04.292 --> 43:06.751
The Herdsman only has one horse for us

43:07.542 --> 43:10.126
You stay here.
I'll come back after I find Wang.

43:10.751 --> 43:12.084
You do wanna get rid of me huh.

43:12.459 --> 43:13.376
You'll be safe here.

43:16.292 --> 43:17.959
Go to hell. Hu Bayi!

43:20.459 --> 43:23.751
(Mongolian nursery rhyme)
My favorite pony

43:24.084 --> 43:26.917
hides in daddy's horses...

43:43.126 --> 43:43.751
Do you like it?

43:57.417 --> 43:58.084
Shirley

44:05.251 --> 44:07.376
Shirley

44:08.459 --> 44:09.751
Drag the left rope inwards.

44:10.417 --> 44:11.251
Watch out.

44:12.376 --> 44:13.584
Get out of the way

44:13.709 --> 44:14.417
I'm busy

44:19.584 --> 44:20.084
What are you doing ?

44:21.667 --> 44:23.042
Do you see this?

44:23.959 --> 44:27.334
Don't you think that

44:28.834 --> 44:30.751
our gears are a bit out of time.

44:31.292 --> 44:34.209
Don't just follow your instinct.

44:34.626 --> 44:36.917
We should also follow our times.

44:38.459 --> 44:39.417
We'll see

44:41.417 --> 44:44.042
There tools are inherited
from a thousand years ago,

44:44.667 --> 44:47.251
and have been examined
more than a thousand years.

44:47.501 --> 44:48.584
What the hell do you know?

45:05.251 --> 45:06.876
The air is safe, get prepared.

45:11.709 --> 45:12.834
Boring

45:14.084 --> 45:16.334
Every thing's electronic.
What's the fun of it?!

45:16.667 --> 45:18.417
Hurry up guys!

45:18.584 --> 45:19.209
Okay

45:19.709 --> 45:22.001
What are you doing, Grill? Follow me

45:23.084 --> 45:24.042
You get down there first

45:28.126 --> 45:29.876
Ladies, do think twice.

45:30.542 --> 45:34.376
Raiding a tomb is no joke

45:35.251 --> 45:36.251
Look at you,

45:36.376 --> 45:37.334
are you ready for this?

45:38.084 --> 45:42.042
We all live by beliefs.

45:43.917 --> 45:44.501
How about

45:44.626 --> 45:46.626
I leave you ladies and gentlemen here.

45:47.334 --> 45:49.376
I'm just a business man you know,

45:49.501 --> 45:50.959
Tomb raiding is not my thing.

45:51.084 --> 45:52.959
I'd better stay here.

46:03.251 --> 46:04.292
One two

46:04.751 --> 46:05.834
three

46:40.334 --> 46:41.876
What are you doing?

46:43.251 --> 46:46.584
This is what happens when the
ancient paints react to the air.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.417
Get educated, ignorant!

46:49.542 --> 46:50.209
You see?

46:50.334 --> 46:50.917
See?

46:51.292 --> 46:53.626
This is the difference between
professional and amateur.

46:53.917 --> 46:57.334
By the way, keep an eye on your guys.

46:57.751 --> 46:58.959
From now on

46:59.292 --> 47:01.084
everybody follows my order.

47:02.501 --> 47:04.334
Is this Khitanan?

47:05.667 --> 47:06.792
What does it say?

47:06.917 --> 47:09.834
A blind would see that it says

47:09.959 --> 47:11.501
Tomb raiders shall die.

47:14.417 --> 47:15.917
It is more than a few words

47:16.917 --> 47:20.959
This frescoe must have been
for a thousand years.

47:21.084 --> 47:25.417
We can get at least a cruise
if we trade it in the US.

47:26.251 --> 47:28.417
And some girls too.

47:29.459 --> 47:32.584
Worth getting some kicks.

47:48.167 --> 47:50.709
Wait for me!

47:50.834 --> 47:51.626
You guys over there.

47:52.126 --> 47:55.084
Wow, look at him.

47:55.626 --> 47:57.001
Great pose.

47:58.126 --> 47:59.126
Enough...

47:59.751 --> 48:00.959
This is just a door man.

48:06.084 --> 48:08.042
Is that a dog head?

48:09.709 --> 48:11.001
Don't mess around.

48:12.126 --> 48:13.751
Follow his order.

48:36.792 --> 48:41.292
Master, this bronze badge is
the same with what we had.

48:42.459 --> 48:44.251
No no

48:45.417 --> 48:48.084
This is not a job for little girls

49:10.584 --> 49:11.042
Master

49:50.959 --> 49:52.542
Holy shit, this is...

49:53.042 --> 49:53.792
Keep your hands off

50:01.251 --> 50:01.876
Be quiet.

50:02.959 --> 50:04.626
This corpse has been here for
more than a thousand years

50:05.167 --> 50:07.417
It goes into dust once the wind blows

50:26.167 --> 50:26.751
Stay still.

50:42.084 --> 50:43.001
It's poisonous.

50:48.959 --> 50:50.459
Stay away from them. It's infectious.

50:53.459 --> 50:54.334
Master

50:54.751 --> 50:55.876
Help Me!

50:56.667 --> 51:00.584
Master, help me please!

51:00.834 --> 51:01.834
Let the great awareness
descent upon them,

51:01.959 --> 51:03.084
and the great relief be with them.

51:03.501 --> 51:04.334
Let the great awareness
descent upon them,

51:04.459 --> 51:05.459
and the great relief be with them.

51:05.751 --> 51:06.542
Let the great awareness
descent upon them,

51:06.667 --> 51:07.542
and the great relief be with them.

51:07.667 --> 51:08.584
Yoko

51:15.542 --> 51:16.709
Bastards.

51:16.834 --> 51:17.542
What's wrong?

51:17.709 --> 51:18.251
Hey!

51:18.542 --> 51:20.501
Are you guys deaf?

51:20.917 --> 51:21.584
What did you do?

51:23.292 --> 51:25.417
Tonight is our last chance.

51:26.251 --> 51:27.626
Let's make our aspiration to relieve
all creatures come true.

51:27.751 --> 51:28.834
You are so cruel.

51:28.959 --> 51:30.167
Let the great awareness
descent upon them,

51:30.292 --> 51:31.126
and the great relief be with them.

51:31.251 --> 51:32.542
Keep those nonsense to yourself.

51:32.667 --> 51:34.542
Shut up! The Master is releasing
the souls of the dead from hell.

51:34.667 --> 51:35.709
Take it easy.

51:35.834 --> 51:37.084
You little pussy.

51:41.751 --> 51:42.584
He is still alive

51:44.542 --> 51:45.251
For real.

51:54.542 --> 51:55.417
Grill!Run!

51:57.542 --> 51:58.542
Stay away from them.

52:02.917 --> 52:03.667
Where to?

52:03.792 --> 52:05.251
The first obstacle is, the first...

52:06.042 --> 52:07.376
...whatever.

52:08.584 --> 52:09.584
Wait for me!

52:32.209 --> 52:34.417
We are back here again.

52:34.584 --> 52:36.334
This is a maze.

52:36.459 --> 52:37.542
What poison it is?

52:37.667 --> 52:39.709
It turned them into zombies.

52:40.917 --> 52:42.459
To the other side!

52:53.417 --> 52:54.876
Here again.

52:58.584 --> 52:59.751
Abracadabra.

53:00.084 --> 53:01.251
There you go.

53:09.042 --> 53:09.417
Oi.

53:10.376 --> 53:11.501
You think that you are something?

53:14.376 --> 53:16.459
Fuck you.

53:17.209 --> 53:18.292
Gross!

53:18.417 --> 53:20.209
Mr. Wang,
this must be the legendary weapon

53:20.334 --> 53:22.792
to kill all the zombies.

53:22.917 --> 53:24.292
Hard boiled mule foot.

53:28.042 --> 53:30.792
Mr. Wang. hold it off!

53:30.917 --> 53:33.042
Damn...

53:34.376 --> 53:36.126
Master Kai, this mule foot
might be boiled too much.

53:51.292 --> 53:52.376
The heavenly god overpowers
the tiger on the ground

53:52.667 --> 53:53.959
The holy tower suffocates
the ghost of the river.

53:59.126 --> 54:00.167
Finally.

54:00.292 --> 54:00.959
Go!

54:02.417 --> 54:03.084
Great.

54:03.251 --> 54:05.292
Now we are saved.

54:07.751 --> 54:08.751
Who needs to be saved by him?

54:09.501 --> 54:11.251
Why don't you go back to the capitalists

54:12.167 --> 54:13.167
and drink Coca Cola.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.459
See? They don't need you at all,

54:15.751 --> 54:17.334
and you are dumb enough to go
all the way here only to be scolded.

54:19.959 --> 54:20.626
Let's get out first

54:20.917 --> 54:21.626
then you can bicker

54:32.167 --> 54:33.251
Let's go back from our way in.

54:36.959 --> 54:37.417
Go!

54:39.584 --> 54:39.959
Go!

54:46.834 --> 54:48.417
It's over.

54:48.917 --> 54:50.542
We're stuck here.

54:50.876 --> 54:51.417
Surely one of the cave leads to the exit

54:51.542 --> 54:53.084
among all.

54:54.417 --> 54:55.709
There is a statue in each cave.

54:57.001 --> 54:57.667
Goat

54:58.251 --> 54:58.834
Chicken

54:59.376 --> 54:59.917
Dog

55:00.709 --> 55:01.167
Mouse

55:02.834 --> 55:03.584
It's the Zodiac.

55:04.709 --> 55:05.334
No.

55:07.251 --> 55:09.834
Only eight caves.

55:10.542 --> 55:11.417
Not twelve.

55:12.917 --> 55:13.542
It's the eight trigrams of fortune,
the 'Ba Gua'.

55:13.667 --> 55:14.959
What on earth is this place?

55:15.084 --> 55:17.042
We've been running back
and forth for a hundred times.

55:17.167 --> 55:18.792
Every animal represents a diagram.

55:20.917 --> 55:24.251
To seek the Dragon through obstacles,
each obstacle is a gate.

55:24.792 --> 55:26.417
All the obstacles

55:26.751 --> 55:28.917
are made up of the Ba Gua.

55:34.501 --> 55:37.084
The entry is horse. Horse signifies fire.

55:37.751 --> 55:39.459
Mouse,horse, water

55:41.084 --> 55:42.709
fire..goat, earth...dog..

55:43.584 --> 55:49.251
The opposite of northwest is the exit.

55:50.251 --> 55:51.667
Dog is the exit. Come on!

55:51.792 --> 55:53.251
Dog!

55:56.209 --> 55:57.459
Go to hell!

55:59.167 --> 55:59.792
Come on !

56:03.626 --> 56:04.209
Let's go!

56:09.417 --> 56:09.792
Be quick!

56:09.917 --> 56:12.167
I can't go on.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.917
Let's go back and leave this chaos.

56:22.376 --> 56:23.001
Go. Let's go.

56:23.126 --> 56:23.501
Go.

56:23.626 --> 56:24.959
Back. Back where?

56:25.459 --> 56:26.376
I've signed the contract.

56:26.501 --> 56:27.917
You are just a money-grabber,

56:28.042 --> 56:28.917
with no resistance to temptation.

56:29.042 --> 56:30.292
He is the one

56:30.959 --> 56:32.542
with no resistance to temptation.

56:33.251 --> 56:36.584
Fled to America in your trickery,
and lived a life by cheating on street.

56:36.792 --> 56:38.834
That's what you call quitting.

56:42.084 --> 56:44.126
Now that Mojin Xiaoweis are all here,

56:44.251 --> 56:46.417
as if instructed by god,

56:47.376 --> 56:49.792
you are welcomed to give me your hands.

56:49.917 --> 56:51.126
Hold on there,

56:51.959 --> 56:52.459
young ladies.

56:52.584 --> 56:54.584
Now we've got another case.

56:54.959 --> 56:57.251
I believe you've heard of these two

56:58.167 --> 57:00.584
The great Mr. Hu, Hu Bayi

57:01.084 --> 57:02.417
and Miss Shirley Young.

57:02.959 --> 57:05.584
They are the best of the best.

57:06.251 --> 57:07.792
It's one thing to pay

57:07.917 --> 57:09.542
for Mr. Wang's effort

57:09.751 --> 57:12.126
and it's another to pay for the Mojin team,

57:12.459 --> 57:14.792
which is rare in our business.

57:14.917 --> 57:16.709
Lucky you.

57:17.667 --> 57:18.834
Although,

57:19.584 --> 57:22.542
the cost will go all the way up.

57:24.334 --> 57:25.751
There is too much evil in this world,

57:26.459 --> 57:28.292
and great calamities
will descend upon human.

57:29.417 --> 57:32.834
If you can help me,
the world will be saved.

57:32.959 --> 57:36.834
There were so many killed by you.
ls that what you call saving the world?

57:37.584 --> 57:40.084
Their sacrifices are for
the greater believes.

57:41.667 --> 57:42.626
For you.

57:43.751 --> 57:45.376
For us all.

57:46.084 --> 57:48.251
They are the true believers.

57:48.417 --> 57:49.709
Are you mad?

57:49.876 --> 57:50.501
Madam

57:53.167 --> 57:54.251
Please excuse us.

57:55.042 --> 57:55.792
We three

57:57.292 --> 57:58.709
have washed our hands,

58:00.459 --> 58:01.751
and this is not our thing any more.

58:02.542 --> 58:03.584
You'd better think twice before you act.

58:04.792 --> 58:05.209
Let's go.

58:05.417 --> 58:05.751
Mr Hu,

58:05.876 --> 58:07.167
How much do you want?

58:08.417 --> 58:09.042
Name a price.

58:09.709 --> 58:10.876
Stop acting like Saints.

58:11.751 --> 58:13.626
Petty tomb-raiders.

58:15.084 --> 58:15.751
Say it again?

58:16.542 --> 58:17.667
Tomb-raiders?

58:18.251 --> 58:20.209
You are worse than tomb-raiders.

58:20.584 --> 58:23.417
We are 'bringing the feudalism
down to the ground'

58:24.001 --> 58:24.459
and you?

58:25.376 --> 58:28.334
You are stabbing your people
behind their backs. How glorious you are!

58:28.917 --> 58:31.042
This is Lady Ying Caihong

58:31.251 --> 58:33.167
who's born in the countryside
of Sichuan Province.

58:33.417 --> 58:35.251
A faker huh?

58:35.501 --> 58:38.376
She's said to have a black pupil
and a yellow one

58:38.501 --> 58:39.917
so that she could see
the gods and the ghosts.

58:40.209 --> 58:41.834
Deemed to be an ominous
figure by the villagers,

58:42.376 --> 58:45.501
she was adopted by a tycoon from Japan.

58:45.917 --> 58:47.334
However, it was more than just 'adopted'...

58:47.459 --> 58:48.751
Stop making stories or I'll make you stop!

58:49.209 --> 58:49.751
Miss Yang.

58:50.751 --> 58:53.709
You were said to be
in hospital with illness

58:54.459 --> 58:56.501
once he passed away.

58:57.792 --> 58:59.459
Suddenly reappeared several years later,

58:59.834 --> 59:01.834
you claimed to have obtained
the power to save the world

59:01.959 --> 59:03.459
after discipline yourself in Everest.

59:03.751 --> 59:04.626
Having gone back to Hong Kong,

59:04.792 --> 59:06.959
you created the so called
"Global Holy Disciplinary institution",

59:07.084 --> 59:09.584
whose members are the ones
with fame and fortune

59:09.709 --> 59:10.917
who would pay quite an amount of money.

59:11.542 --> 59:14.251
Please, Shirley.

59:14.709 --> 59:15.126
Dear lady,

59:15.251 --> 59:16.042
Oh no.

59:16.251 --> 59:17.126
Boss Ying.

59:17.584 --> 59:18.751
Please don't take her words seriously.

59:19.251 --> 59:21.417
Young lady likes to know everything

59:22.042 --> 59:23.959
but with her heart of kindness...

59:24.751 --> 59:26.917
We've just got our collaboration going,

59:27.126 --> 59:29.292
Take it easy.

59:37.167 --> 59:37.751
Wang.

59:38.251 --> 59:38.709
What the hell!

59:38.959 --> 59:40.542
You find the tomb of
the Goddess before dawn,

59:41.251 --> 59:43.584
and I'll make him fit as a fiddle.

59:45.084 --> 59:45.542
President,

59:46.167 --> 59:46.792
there is a bridge

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:05.751
Watch out.

01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:07.251
Grow up guys.

01:00:08.834 --> 01:00:10.709
Find a way and get out.

01:00:11.084 --> 01:00:14.751
Yes, or I'll say bye bye to the world.

01:00:15.167 --> 01:00:19.167
What on earth did I do to deserve this.

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:21.542
Chairman Mao said,

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.084
Be united, not divided.

01:00:25.084 --> 01:00:27.501
What's in here? It's so hard.

01:00:30.084 --> 01:00:32.501
What are looking at? A person of unity?

01:00:33.251 --> 01:00:34.501
Be united, bosses.

01:00:34.626 --> 01:00:38.209
Or else we would all die.

01:00:38.751 --> 01:00:40.251
Then we shall let them know

01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:41.959
who Mojin Xiaoweis really are.

01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:54.876
You asshole, I knew
you'd keep the Mojin amulet.

01:00:56.209 --> 01:00:58.917
You said you have washed your hands.

01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:02.709
You are the one who cheated!

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:06.584
I threw my watch instead

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:08.251
to make you give up

01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:09.917
It was the watch I gave you.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.126
Yeah

01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:12.584
Nice kick, buddy

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:13.626
You...

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:46.292
Let me do it.

01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:50.584
Follow me.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:55.584
Watch out, Mr. Wang.

01:01:57.209 --> 01:01:57.917
Careful.

01:02:04.751 --> 01:02:05.292
Come here.

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:10.584
You jerk,
how come you are getting heavier?

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:14.917
Do you ever poop?

01:02:15.626 --> 01:02:19.917
Have some pity, sir.

01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:24.251
I'm injured only because
I worked too hard for you.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:31.876
Don't.

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:53.334
Help.

01:02:54.251 --> 01:02:54.876
Help!

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:13.959
What bridge is this?

01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:15.917
Bridge to the hell, as it seems.

01:03:24.417 --> 01:03:26.084
It is the bracelet I gave to you.

01:03:26.751 --> 01:03:28.542
It was the watch I gave to you.

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.001
The bridge sets fire to
whatever rubs its surface.

01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:50.376
It's a material of phosphorus,
with very low ignition point.

01:03:51.376 --> 01:03:53.042
The owner of this tomb built the bridge

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.584
so that whoever intrudes
would be burned to death.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.751
Are you sure with your decision?

01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:02.001
All obstacles are the tests of God,

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:04.751
and we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.

01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:10.042
Please don't waste your time,
Mojin Xiaowei,

01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:13.751
What does the cracking planks

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:15.209
on the bridge look like?

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:18.917
Split

01:04:19.584 --> 01:04:21.376
not split. Split.

01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:23.501
The eight trigrams .. Ba Gua!

01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:26.292
The planks are in the shape of Ba Gua

01:04:27.876 --> 01:04:29.959
In which hides the password.

01:04:33.209 --> 01:04:35.792
To seek the Dragon through obstacles,
each obstacle is a gate.

01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:38.709
All the obstacles are made up
of the Ba Gua

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:42.084
with Eight directions
leading to life and death and

01:04:42.542 --> 01:04:45.417
four phases transforming
from nature to the universe:

01:04:46.084 --> 01:04:51.084
Heaven, Thunder, Fire, Mountain

01:04:52.084 --> 01:04:57.292
Lake, Wind, Earth, Water.

01:04:59.792 --> 01:05:04.292
NW, E, S, NE

01:05:04.792 --> 01:05:08.751
W, SE, SW, N

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:13.876
Ba Gua represents the directions.

01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:16.209
North west it is.

01:05:16.376 --> 01:05:17.167
Please.

01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:26.584
We don't need to throw
something ahead first?

01:05:38.084 --> 01:05:38.917
This way.

01:05:39.626 --> 01:05:40.209
Quick.

01:06:04.584 --> 01:06:08.626
This gentleman looks scary. Let's go.

01:06:09.126 --> 01:06:09.917
Which way?

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:10.917
South West.

01:06:25.376 --> 01:06:25.959
Yoko.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:30.126
Go to get the last badge.

01:06:35.917 --> 01:06:36.542
Give it to me.

01:06:41.209 --> 01:06:42.667
Be careful Master.

01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:02.334
Dickheads, getting into troubles again !

01:07:02.959 --> 01:07:04.917
Now we are turning into fillet steaks.

01:07:05.042 --> 01:07:05.584
Run!

01:07:06.084 --> 01:07:06.917
Quick!

01:07:07.376 --> 01:07:08.084
Quick!

01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:09.084
Quick!

01:07:11.292 --> 01:07:12.751
Quick!

01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:16.084
The fire is breathing down my neck!

01:07:17.251 --> 01:07:18.709
Move! Quickly!

01:07:19.251 --> 01:07:20.667
It's coming!

01:07:21.126 --> 01:07:22.917
Be quick, Mr.Wang.

01:07:23.959 --> 01:07:24.751
Quick!

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:29.292
You are gaining weight all the time!

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.709
Not the time to complain!

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:31.709
Quick!

01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:33.917
I am on fire!

01:07:41.251 --> 01:07:41.917
God.

01:07:42.042 --> 01:07:43.251
It's not our fault.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.167
There is no way to help them.

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:46.917
Huh!

01:07:50.584 --> 01:07:51.626
At this point,

01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:53.542
it is better to help ourselves first.

01:07:53.959 --> 01:07:54.959
Let's leave!

01:07:55.084 --> 01:07:55.584
Go.

01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:56.251
Go.

01:07:59.126 --> 01:08:00.376
Asbestos clothes.

01:08:02.917 --> 01:08:03.417
Let's go.

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:04.292
Go.

01:08:17.251 --> 01:08:18.042
Take a rest.

01:08:23.376 --> 01:08:28.084
We are at minus 7 meters altitude,
northwest 292.3 degree to the mountain.

01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:32.084
Southeast to the Yansai Lake
and volcanic crater

01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:33.751
Water sound over there.

01:08:34.084 --> 01:08:35.584
We can get out if we find
the underground stream.

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:36.917
Go.

01:08:38.584 --> 01:08:39.917
Mr. Wang.

01:08:40.376 --> 01:08:41.084
Let's go.

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:42.792
Mr. Wang.

01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:48.126
What are you waiting for?

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:49.792
The fire to catch you?

01:08:51.584 --> 01:08:52.709
What do you mean?

01:08:58.251 --> 01:09:00.167
Are you really gonna leave?

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:01.459
We are already here.

01:09:01.584 --> 01:09:02.584
I know what's in your mind,

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:09.376
but the past belongs to the past.

01:09:10.626 --> 01:09:12.126
We should look forward.

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:13.917
Let's go.

01:09:14.501 --> 01:09:16.584
You let things go easily all the time.

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:18.501
I can't.

01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:20.084
I do look back.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:25.501
I love someone and I never let go.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:47.251
I don't know too much about literature
as you do, Hu. Help me with this.

01:09:49.376 --> 01:09:50.626
Please.

01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:53.084
Wow,

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:55.667
A poem

01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:57.917
of love.

01:09:58.126 --> 01:09:58.584
Don't make fun of me.

01:09:58.834 --> 01:09:59.542
Would you check it?

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:00.584
To whom?

01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:01.917
Whom?

01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:03.126
Not telling.

01:10:04.209 --> 01:10:07.084
Wang Kaixuan wrote a Love poem!

01:10:09.751 --> 01:10:11.293
Are you helping me or not?

01:10:11.459 --> 01:10:11.917
Yeah.

01:10:16.834 --> 01:10:17.417
Misspellings here

01:10:17.959 --> 01:10:18.626
here

01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:19.959
and here.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:22.751
Don't heed it.

01:10:23.876 --> 01:10:26.167
E Er Gu Na River, you made a turn.

01:10:28.209 --> 01:10:29.834
Turn into my heart

01:10:32.542 --> 01:10:33.251
Ok.

01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:36.959
I, Hu Bayi, decide to

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:38.417
edit it for you myself.

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:39.292
How about that?

01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:40.542
That's my bro.

01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:44.292
Is there anything for your bro then?

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:48.292
Who is helping you so much?

01:10:49.834 --> 01:10:50.417
The star badge.

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.292
No way!

01:10:53.084 --> 01:10:54.792
Oi oi.

01:11:05.959 --> 01:11:06.751
It fits you.

01:11:08.834 --> 01:11:12.001
Ding, I've been resisting
the temptation to ask

01:11:15.292 --> 01:11:17.751
if you are willing to sublimate

01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:19.584
our innocent comradeship of revolution.

01:11:22.209 --> 01:11:25.417
In what way?

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:34.584
My heart started to stammer

01:11:35.084 --> 01:11:40.626
when I first saw your bright eyes

01:11:42.084 --> 01:11:42.709
Oh

01:11:43.209 --> 01:11:46.876
E Er Gu Na River

01:11:47.584 --> 01:11:52.584
Your long run have flown
into the mountain of goddess

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:53.376
Idiot!

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:59.376
Flown into the mountain of gods,
into my heart.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:01.792
Wang Kaixuan,

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:03.584
Stop it please.

01:12:04.459 --> 01:12:05.334
People would hear.

01:12:06.084 --> 01:12:07.251
I am just reading

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:08.751
what I felt.

01:12:09.084 --> 01:12:10.376
Wow, the star of the revolution.

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:11.417
Where did you get it?

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:14.584
A...a friend gave it to me.

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.751
Hu... Hu Bayi?

01:12:20.459 --> 01:12:21.417
How did you know?

01:12:22.084 --> 01:12:23.959
I know Ding liked you more

01:12:24.584 --> 01:12:25.542
but I didn't care

01:12:26.751 --> 01:12:29.751
I'm willing to do anything for her.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:37.709
It has been a million times in years

01:12:40.167 --> 01:12:42.417
in night time, when I didn't know
if I was awake or not

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:47.584
I saw her face in front of me.

01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:49.584
Her looking at me

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.959
asking if I've found the Equinox flower

01:12:56.417 --> 01:12:57.626
I could not answer.

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:05.584
Don't you forget about her death.

01:13:17.084 --> 01:13:17.584
Jump.

01:13:32.667 --> 01:13:33.417
Get in.

01:13:34.084 --> 01:13:35.084
Get in.

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.959
Hu Bayi, get in.

01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:45.042
Be quick.

01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:57.626
Ding

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:03.876
Ding

01:14:04.251 --> 01:14:04.917
Hold on.

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:06.792
Hold on to it.

01:14:06.917 --> 01:14:07.792
Don't let go.

01:14:09.417 --> 01:14:11.334
We'll all die if we don't cut the wood.

01:14:11.459 --> 01:14:12.167
Ding

01:14:16.459 --> 01:14:17.126
Ding

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:21.709
ding, hold on.

01:14:21.834 --> 01:14:22.292
Let go!

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:24.126
No!

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:25.001
Please!

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:30.959
Get back!

01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:32.876
What now?

01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:33.917
Ding

01:14:35.292 --> 01:14:35.792
Jump.

01:14:36.251 --> 01:14:36.792
Jump.

01:14:37.209 --> 01:14:39.167
Jump. Ding.

01:14:47.167 --> 01:14:48.959
No!

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:02.334
Ding!

01:15:20.959 --> 01:15:22.334
Ding!

01:15:39.126 --> 01:15:41.001
Ding died for us.

01:15:43.876 --> 01:15:45.126
She really did.

01:15:51.501 --> 01:15:55.084
We are finally here.

01:15:56.126 --> 01:15:57.084
How can I just take it easy and leave?

01:15:58.626 --> 01:16:00.667
Ding sacrificed herself

01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:03.042
for you two to be alive.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:05.542
I really don't understand.

01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:07.667
Why do you wanna come back
and die here?

01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:08.626
Of course you don't.

01:16:10.501 --> 01:16:12.542
I'm ready to give up my life
for Ding any moment.

01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:14.751
This is the comradeship of revolution.

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:18.251
Please go ahead if you wanna leave.

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:22.584
Alright.

01:16:32.542 --> 01:16:33.959
I go with you for the Equinox flower.

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:35.459
Let them wait for us here.

01:16:36.001 --> 01:16:36.501
No joking?

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:37.876
No joking.

01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:47.001
I knew that you weren't
an irresponsible man.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:54.417
Real men

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:55.834
live for loyalty and honesty.

01:16:56.626 --> 01:16:59.376
Don't you guys worry about Miss Yang.
I'll take care of her.

01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:00.084
Don't worry.

01:17:01.376 --> 01:17:02.292
I'll be back soon.

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:03.376
Ciao.

01:17:07.959 --> 01:17:08.292
Let's go.

01:17:15.417 --> 01:17:18.792
Hu Bayi, you liar.

01:17:18.917 --> 01:17:21.334
You two can go to hell.

01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:23.042
I never wanna see you guys anymore!

01:17:23.917 --> 01:17:29.417
We live the days,
the years by our blood and tear.

01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:34.459
We fight against the heaven,

01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:36.209
the earth,

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:38.917
the living and the dead.

01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:40.167
We are fighting together as a team again.

01:17:40.876 --> 01:17:42.251
Yeah. It's fun, isn't it?

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:48.126
What the fuck!

01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:49.209
I am sorry bro.

01:17:49.417 --> 01:17:52.126
You don't listen to me
and I can only use force.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.251
You son of a bitch.

01:17:54.126 --> 01:17:55.001
Are you a real man!

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:57.792
Let me go!

01:17:58.084 --> 01:17:58.626
Let go!

01:18:04.042 --> 01:18:06.167
You shouldn't have saved me at all.

01:18:06.584 --> 01:18:09.459
So that Ding and I could
be together forever

01:18:09.917 --> 01:18:12.084
and no need to suffer for living.

01:18:12.542 --> 01:18:13.292
Nonsense.

01:18:15.292 --> 01:18:17.126
Don't you feel shameful
living a life like this!

01:18:17.251 --> 01:18:19.042
Forgetting is betraying

01:18:22.084 --> 01:18:23.251
Ding Sitian is already died.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:26.042
I can't lose you and Shirley.

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:29.751
I have to take you both out of here
for whatever it takes.

01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:30.709
Do you understand!

01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:35.584
Shut up you traitor!

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:39.917
Damn you!

01:18:40.334 --> 01:18:41.542
I've promised Ding

01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:43.126
to find Equinox flower.

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.376
I meant it.

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:45.709
I'm not like you.

01:19:21.834 --> 01:19:22.792
Shirley.

01:19:26.084 --> 01:19:26.584
Grill.

01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:28.709
Mr. Hu.

01:19:30.542 --> 01:19:31.376
Where's Shirley?

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:34.042
I'm useless...

01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:42.126
You guys ran pretty fast huh.

01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:44.917
Where's Shirley?

01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:46.667
Mr. Wang is here.

01:19:58.292 --> 01:19:58.917
Hu!

01:19:59.834 --> 01:20:00.417
Here you go!

01:20:00.959 --> 01:20:01.584
Go!

01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:02.834
Damn you!

01:20:05.876 --> 01:20:07.084
Damn you!

01:20:48.084 --> 01:20:49.584
Little bitch!

01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:00.584
Where's Shirley?

01:21:00.959 --> 01:21:01.751
Hold!

01:21:08.292 --> 01:21:10.001
Don't hurt her. Take your weapons down.

01:21:10.251 --> 01:21:11.084
Let's talk.

01:21:13.126 --> 01:21:14.042
There's nothing to talk about.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:14.876
Yuko

01:21:16.084 --> 01:21:16.584
Let me go!

01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:17.334
Chill.

01:21:17.459 --> 01:21:18.376
Take it easy.

01:21:18.542 --> 01:21:19.334
Take it easy.

01:21:24.584 --> 01:21:25.042
Calm down.

01:21:25.167 --> 01:21:26.292
Find me the tomb.

01:21:26.417 --> 01:21:28.167
Your girlfriend'll be safe.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.292
I'm not his girlfriend!

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.167
She is.

01:21:31.876 --> 01:21:33.334
What the hell.

01:21:34.084 --> 01:21:35.709
Slept together doesn't mean
that we are in a relationship.

01:21:37.042 --> 01:21:38.417
Slept together of course means
we are in a relationship.

01:21:38.959 --> 01:21:40.584
Slept...slept together?

01:21:42.084 --> 01:21:42.959
You...you

01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:44.251
You sleep with me everyday.

01:21:44.542 --> 01:21:44.959
It's not that complicated

01:21:45.084 --> 01:21:46.376
to have a quickie.

01:21:46.626 --> 01:21:49.542
No..I mean..What?

01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:51.334
When did you do that?

01:21:52.751 --> 01:21:53.667
The day we made the vow.

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:55.917
What?

01:21:58.376 --> 01:21:58.917
That day?

01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:02.167
The day I slept in the toilet
and you two...

01:22:03.834 --> 01:22:06.001
Oh my god!

01:22:06.584 --> 01:22:07.334
You are such a beast!

01:22:07.459 --> 01:22:08.292
Mr. Hu is also a human being.

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:09.542
He didn't take advantage of me.

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:10.917
I fucked him.

01:22:11.917 --> 01:22:15.959
Wow you are such a feminist!

01:22:16.084 --> 01:22:17.584
Shame!

01:22:18.459 --> 01:22:19.417
Shut up!

01:22:19.876 --> 01:22:22.917
You idiots!

01:22:23.459 --> 01:22:25.834
Fuckin' loser!

01:22:26.126 --> 01:22:27.126
Jerks! Wankers! Assholes!

01:22:27.251 --> 01:22:28.501
Have you got fuckin' enough

01:22:28.626 --> 01:22:29.626
You fuckers!

01:22:30.042 --> 01:22:34.376
I don't give a fuckin' shit
about your relationships.

01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:39.042
Don't waste my fuckin' time!

01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:39.542
Calm down.

01:22:39.667 --> 01:22:40.417
Lady.

01:22:41.334 --> 01:22:44.126
My compass is broken so I can't
use the 'dragon seeking' now.

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.709
The world's going to be destroyed anyway.

01:22:53.834 --> 01:22:56.084
I don't mind destroying this one first.

01:22:56.751 --> 01:22:58.251
Lady, I have an idea.

01:22:59.584 --> 01:23:02.376
I've taken you get out of the traps.

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:05.084
You should trust me.

01:23:05.792 --> 01:23:07.751
But I need my girlfriend help me.

01:23:13.626 --> 01:23:17.751
Human body could also sense
the electrical currents

01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:23.917
To locate the tomb.
It's called Yin-Yang-Gong-Ji.

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:25.292
Here

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:28.751
are eight statues and they're
arranged in a specific way.

01:23:29.334 --> 01:23:31.251
They represent Ba Gua.

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:35.376
It seems that we are gonna die...

01:23:36.584 --> 01:23:39.167
I'm curious to see how the show goes on

01:23:39.917 --> 01:23:41.501
We need to get rid of this rope.

01:23:41.751 --> 01:23:46.459
To seek the Dragon through obstacles,
each obstacle is a gate...

01:23:46.584 --> 01:23:49.292
You are such a swindler.

01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:52.334
Synchronizing the Yin and the Yang...

01:23:54.251 --> 01:23:56.459
to form the constellations

01:23:56.751 --> 01:23:59.084
for searching the lost dragon...

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:08.292
What are you doing?

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:09.501
Nothing.

01:24:12.626 --> 01:24:14.001
What the hell!

01:24:17.667 --> 01:24:18.584
You've got strength haven't you!

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:19.709
What? You didn't get hurt by the bullet!

01:24:20.626 --> 01:24:21.626
I did I did.

01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:23.376
It protected me from the bullet.

01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:26.334
No wonder you are heavier!

01:24:27.084 --> 01:24:28.084
They've only got one gun.

01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:29.292
I distract them, you run!

01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:31.209
No you run.

01:24:32.251 --> 01:24:33.292
I'm asking you to run!

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:36.917
I'm not leaving you alone here.

01:24:41.292 --> 01:24:41.751
Don't don't...

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:42.792
Damn you!

01:24:42.959 --> 01:24:43.626
You come here!

01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:44.626
Run!

01:24:44.917 --> 01:24:47.167
I'm not leaving you.

01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:48.959
You son of a bitch.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.501
You lied to me!

01:24:50.626 --> 01:24:51.251
Leave!

01:24:51.751 --> 01:24:53.251
And rode me as your donkey?!

01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:54.626
I'm gonna kill you!

01:24:55.876 --> 01:24:58.251
Here's a tunnel!

01:25:13.667 --> 01:25:14.917
We are at the bottom of the lake

01:25:19.876 --> 01:25:20.876
Shirley, What does it say on the mural?

01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:24.751
Heaven opened and Earth cracked.

01:25:25.626 --> 01:25:27.792
The very first shaman received
a sacred treasure from the gods.

01:25:28.334 --> 01:25:29.751
It has the power to connect Yin and Yang

01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:31.667
and to bring the dead back to life.

01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:35.751
Princess Aogu obtained it
a thousand years ago.

01:25:36.084 --> 01:25:38.542
She named it “The Equinox Flower”.

01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:45.584
The “Equinox Flower” blooms every time
the sun and moon unite.

01:25:46.917 --> 01:25:48.584
And the gate between life
and death will be open.

01:25:49.917 --> 01:25:50.917
Ding said that

01:25:51.792 --> 01:25:53.584
The Equinox flower's able to
connect the living and the dead.

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:03.542
You must have came here for this.

01:26:04.001 --> 01:26:07.667
Humanity is on the verge of destruction,
this is the last hope.

01:26:08.917 --> 01:26:10.751
I'm your only saviour.

01:26:11.042 --> 01:26:12.334
If I can get the Equinox flower,

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:15.292
I'll be able to resurrect people
from the death.

01:26:15.417 --> 01:26:16.542
Who wants to be saved by a lunatic!

01:26:16.667 --> 01:26:17.084
Move!

01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:18.459
Calm down.

01:26:18.584 --> 01:26:19.167
Move!

01:26:20.084 --> 01:26:20.709
Let's go.

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:23.251
Ok ok.

01:27:27.792 --> 01:27:30.042
That black stone is the Equinox flower?

01:27:30.542 --> 01:27:32.084
The mural shows that
it fell directly from the Heaven.

01:27:32.751 --> 01:27:33.834
It could be a meteorolite

01:27:34.084 --> 01:27:36.876
A meteorolite can save the world?

01:27:46.626 --> 01:27:47.417
Be careful.

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:15.126
These three badges are the keys
of the coffin, right?

01:28:15.834 --> 01:28:16.334
Yes.

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.042
Do what you do best.

01:28:19.251 --> 01:28:20.084
Open the coffin!

01:28:59.542 --> 01:29:00.626
Mojin Xiaowei,

01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:01.959
United we stand,

01:29:02.084 --> 01:29:03.167
Divided we fall.

01:29:09.459 --> 01:29:12.501
That's it. The 'Mojin' Style!

01:30:30.959 --> 01:30:32.126
The Equinox flower!

01:30:59.417 --> 01:30:59.917
Mr. Hu!

01:31:01.251 --> 01:31:02.084
Mr. Wang!

01:31:03.584 --> 01:31:04.417
Miss Shirley!

01:31:06.251 --> 01:31:06.751
Shirley.

01:31:33.084 --> 01:31:33.834
We've been here before.

01:31:35.126 --> 01:31:35.584
Wang,

01:31:36.126 --> 01:31:36.667
Look!

01:31:39.251 --> 01:31:40.126
Oh my god.

01:31:42.417 --> 01:31:43.751
Look at that flag!

01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:46.751
It's been twenty years,

01:31:47.917 --> 01:31:48.751
we've been in a cycle.

01:31:51.334 --> 01:31:52.334
We' re back to the start again...

01:31:52.459 --> 01:31:56.084
Boss Hong, I beg you
to save my best friends.

01:31:58.376 --> 01:32:00.751
Take back the final payment.

01:32:00.959 --> 01:32:03.042
The Mojins can't all die like this!

01:32:05.334 --> 01:32:06.334
Screw you!

01:32:06.667 --> 01:32:07.876
You little bitch

01:32:08.001 --> 01:32:09.709
I'm gonna educate you today!

01:32:17.792 --> 01:32:20.584
You said the Equinox Flower
blooms in twilight?

01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:23.167
Yes. According to the ancients,

01:32:23.292 --> 01:32:25.834
they often refer to Ying Shi,
which is about 5 in the morning...

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:29.292
the incident happened 20 years ago,
what time was it?

01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:30.792
I remembered that right
after we escaped from the base,

01:32:30.917 --> 01:32:32.042
the sun soon came out.

01:32:40.126 --> 01:32:42.209
Do you still remember the light we saw?

01:32:43.584 --> 01:32:45.126
It caused the problem.

01:32:46.001 --> 01:32:46.959
When the light appeared

01:32:48.917 --> 01:32:50.001
The dead soldiers came back to life.

01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:53.084
The light was from above.

01:32:53.459 --> 01:32:55.667
It must be from the coffin.

01:33:00.084 --> 01:33:00.584
No.

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:04.709
The light actually came
from the Equinox flower.

01:33:07.917 --> 01:33:08.709
I am saved

01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:12.084
The Equinox flower is mine

01:33:19.501 --> 01:33:20.459
It is Yin Shi.

01:33:20.959 --> 01:33:21.917
We should get out of the palace,

01:33:22.042 --> 01:33:22.876
It's dangerous!

01:33:23.376 --> 01:33:24.042
Grill!

01:33:25.626 --> 01:33:26.251
Grill!

01:33:26.584 --> 01:33:27.834
Let's go, Grill!

01:33:53.959 --> 01:33:54.542
Zombies!

01:33:54.876 --> 01:33:56.126
Zombies!

01:33:57.251 --> 01:33:59.001
They are all Zombies!

01:34:00.084 --> 01:34:00.542
Don't eat me!

01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:01.417
Run!

01:34:01.834 --> 01:34:02.251
Grill!

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:17.626
Master!

01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:19.667
Get out of the way!

01:34:20.126 --> 01:34:20.917
I don't want you to follow me, get out!

01:34:21.042 --> 01:34:24.334
I'm your Slave.

01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:27.334
Why do you abandon me?

01:34:35.542 --> 01:34:36.584
Save me

01:34:36.876 --> 01:34:38.167
Master!

01:34:42.126 --> 01:34:43.042
I don't have magic

01:34:44.917 --> 01:34:48.917
I only have anesthetics inside my ring,
and a lot of money.

01:34:49.459 --> 01:34:51.042
I can't save you

01:34:51.834 --> 01:34:53.334
I can't save you

01:34:54.167 --> 01:34:55.542
My life is doomed.

01:34:56.792 --> 01:35:00.251
There's something growing
inside of my brain. There is no cure.

01:35:01.917 --> 01:35:03.459
I need the Equinox flower

01:35:04.417 --> 01:35:05.667
I need the Equinox flower

01:35:05.959 --> 01:35:07.917
I need the Equinox flower

01:35:15.584 --> 01:35:17.084
I'm dying.

01:35:18.126 --> 01:35:19.584
Only with the Equinox flower

01:35:20.417 --> 01:35:23.167
I may start a new life.

01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:35.459
It's that stone!

01:35:35.959 --> 01:35:36.751
Destroy the Equinox flower!

01:36:09.584 --> 01:36:10.417
Hu Bayi

01:36:11.584 --> 01:36:13.334
Hold onto me, let's go together!

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:39.001
How long are we gonna stay?

01:36:40.917 --> 01:36:41.917
As long as we wish.

01:36:57.959 --> 01:36:58.584
What's this?

01:37:00.209 --> 01:37:01.001
The Equinox flower.

01:37:01.626 --> 01:37:05.792
Legends say that
it transcends life and death.

01:37:06.876 --> 01:37:09.751
I never knew that it would grow here.

01:37:15.876 --> 01:37:16.584
Ding

01:37:18.626 --> 01:37:19.834
I always wanted to tell you

01:37:22.251 --> 01:37:22.917
I...

01:37:24.459 --> 01:37:25.084
We...

01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:33.626
The star badge I gave you...

01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:37.209
Why is it reversed?

01:37:52.542 --> 01:37:53.126
Ding!

01:37:55.834 --> 01:37:56.459
Ding!

01:38:23.667 --> 01:38:24.292
Hu Bayi

01:38:24.751 --> 01:38:25.876
Do you want the Equinox flower?

01:38:39.251 --> 01:38:41.834
You'll never see me if you destroy this.

01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:43.334
Are you really going to do this?

01:38:53.334 --> 01:38:54.459
You are not Ding Sitian.

01:39:02.251 --> 01:39:03.292
You are illusion.

01:39:04.084 --> 01:39:04.792
You are not real.

01:39:05.792 --> 01:39:09.001
You are my memory,

01:39:10.334 --> 01:39:12.084
Dragging me back to the past.

01:39:12.917 --> 01:39:14.292
Are you going to forget me?

01:39:18.084 --> 01:39:19.667
I won't forget Ding Sitian.

01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:27.876
But she sacrificed her own life

01:39:30.501 --> 01:39:32.251
Not to leave me in sorrow

01:39:33.251 --> 01:39:35.292
but to live in a meaningful life.

01:39:48.417 --> 01:39:49.126
Give it to me

01:39:50.001 --> 01:39:50.542
Wang

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:51.376
Give it to me

01:39:51.584 --> 01:39:52.209
Let go!

01:39:52.626 --> 01:39:53.376
Let go!

01:39:53.959 --> 01:39:55.126
Give me the Equinox flower!

01:39:57.251 --> 01:39:59.001
The flower belongs to Ding.

01:39:59.751 --> 01:40:00.876
No one is allowed to touch it.

01:40:02.126 --> 01:40:03.584
I found it!

01:40:04.459 --> 01:40:06.251
I found the Equinox flower!

01:40:08.834 --> 01:40:11.251
I keep my promise.

01:40:11.834 --> 01:40:12.834
From now on,

01:40:12.959 --> 01:40:14.917
I will never let anything to hurt you,

01:40:15.917 --> 01:40:18.876
even if I die.

01:40:20.084 --> 01:40:20.751
Ding.

01:40:21.792 --> 01:40:22.584
You were right,

01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:26.376
equinox Flower is so beautiful.

01:40:28.584 --> 01:40:29.251
Wang Kaixuan

01:40:30.042 --> 01:40:30.792
Give it to me

01:40:46.251 --> 01:40:47.084
Wang!

01:40:50.542 --> 01:40:51.584
This is just an illusion.

01:40:54.876 --> 01:40:55.542
It's not real.

01:40:56.959 --> 01:40:58.292
The guilty for Ding

01:40:58.876 --> 01:41:00.584
is but our obsession.

01:41:19.167 --> 01:41:20.042
It's been twenty years,

01:41:23.584 --> 01:41:24.251
let go of it

01:42:09.876 --> 01:42:10.542
Ding

01:42:13.584 --> 01:42:14.209
Bye

01:42:17.251 --> 01:42:19.126
Bye

01:42:32.417 --> 01:42:32.917
Grill!

01:42:37.542 --> 01:42:39.292
Zombies! Zombies!

01:42:39.417 --> 01:42:40.167
Zombies!

01:42:40.292 --> 01:42:41.042
Grill!

01:42:42.751 --> 01:42:43.417
Zombies!

01:42:43.584 --> 01:42:44.626
Don't follow me!

01:42:52.542 --> 01:42:53.667
With the equinox flower

01:42:55.251 --> 01:42:56.667
I can come back alive.

01:42:58.126 --> 01:42:59.084
The Equinox flower...

01:42:59.917 --> 01:43:00.959
I can come back alive

01:43:01.084 --> 01:43:02.167
Run! Dangerous!

01:43:02.584 --> 01:43:04.209
The palace's self-destructive

01:43:04.334 --> 01:43:04.917
Yoko

01:43:05.251 --> 01:43:05.876
Wait for me

01:43:06.001 --> 01:43:07.084
It's just a meteorolite.

01:43:07.459 --> 01:43:09.126
Its light makes people hallucinate.

01:43:09.334 --> 01:43:10.084
It doesn't bring the dead back to life.

01:43:10.209 --> 01:43:11.042
Shut up

01:43:16.417 --> 01:43:17.001
Be careful!

01:43:22.792 --> 01:43:23.459
The palace is about to collapse

01:43:27.084 --> 01:43:27.876
Hurry up!

01:43:32.251 --> 01:43:32.709
Quickly!

01:43:36.917 --> 01:43:39.251
Stop following me!

01:43:55.417 --> 01:43:57.584
Grill! Hold me tight!

01:44:05.917 --> 01:44:06.751
Jump!

01:44:22.167 --> 01:44:27.917
<i>The deer is eaten by the tiger,
the tiger is chased by the bear</i>

01:44:50.459 --> 01:44:53.001
Mum, Dad, there is a monster in the lake!

01:45:07.959 --> 01:45:09.251
Oh my god it looks serious...

01:45:10.209 --> 01:45:10.834
We can't get out.

01:45:13.334 --> 01:45:13.959
Don't space out.

01:45:14.167 --> 01:45:14.917
Think!

01:45:17.459 --> 01:45:18.667
Stop!

01:45:18.792 --> 01:45:19.376
Coffin!

01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:20.376
Coffins float!

01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:21.834
We can use them!

01:45:22.417 --> 01:45:22.751
Go!

01:45:25.459 --> 01:45:25.917
Go!

01:45:26.584 --> 01:45:27.042
Let's go!

01:45:36.667 --> 01:45:36.959
Help!

01:45:37.084 --> 01:45:37.626
Master zombies! Please!

01:45:37.751 --> 01:45:38.292
Give me!

01:45:38.417 --> 01:45:39.084
Please!

01:45:41.917 --> 01:45:42.417
Come on!

01:45:43.292 --> 01:45:44.251
Please!

01:45:47.084 --> 01:45:47.667
Hurry up!

01:45:59.959 --> 01:46:01.417
It's okay. I'm here.

01:46:02.876 --> 01:46:04.542
Shut up, hold tight.

01:46:06.042 --> 01:46:07.417
I will beat the hell out of you!

01:46:07.542 --> 01:46:08.584
Wanna bite me?

01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:10.084
Shut up, hold me!

01:46:10.417 --> 01:46:12.084
Go to hell!

01:46:15.876 --> 01:46:17.251
I bite the soul out of you!

01:46:36.792 --> 01:46:38.001
I think we are on the surface now.

01:46:57.376 --> 01:46:58.417
We are still in the underground palace.

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:06.667
We are stuck in the cavern
on the rocky cliff.

01:47:09.751 --> 01:47:13.209
Soon we'll be drowned.

01:47:29.459 --> 01:47:30.626
A good way to end our lives.

01:47:52.667 --> 01:47:54.626
Do you know what I like you the most?

01:47:57.209 --> 01:47:57.834
I don't know.

01:48:08.459 --> 01:48:09.209
It's the way

01:48:09.334 --> 01:48:10.209
you yell at me.

01:48:13.584 --> 01:48:14.584
It would be such a pity that

01:48:15.167 --> 01:48:17.042
a lovely girl like you to die here with me

01:48:18.084 --> 01:48:19.001
Hu Bayi!

01:48:19.751 --> 01:48:21.292
Hu Bayi, you asshole!

01:48:22.167 --> 01:48:23.251
Let me get out!

01:48:24.001 --> 01:48:26.417
You promised that if we die,
we'll die together!

01:48:27.417 --> 01:48:29.709
Let me out! Let me out!

01:48:29.834 --> 01:48:31.667
We have to die together.

01:48:31.917 --> 01:48:33.792
I wanna be with you!

01:48:37.126 --> 01:48:38.792
You irresponsible asshole!

01:48:39.792 --> 01:48:41.251
No one would ever like such an arrogant

01:48:41.917 --> 01:48:42.917
egoistic

01:48:43.459 --> 01:48:45.084
smartass punk like you!

01:48:47.751 --> 01:48:49.917
I don't want to die with you

01:48:50.042 --> 01:48:51.376
I don't want to dream of you

01:48:54.001 --> 01:48:55.292
Hu Bayi!

01:49:33.584 --> 01:49:35.542
Zombies, don't try to run away!

01:49:35.751 --> 01:49:36.542
Come here!

01:49:37.126 --> 01:49:37.917
Grill!

01:49:38.626 --> 01:49:39.917
Look carefully, look who I am!

01:49:41.209 --> 01:49:42.792
I'll beat the hell out of you zombie!

01:49:42.959 --> 01:49:43.834
I'm gonna call you papa

01:49:43.959 --> 01:49:45.542
if I don't kill you today!

01:49:47.959 --> 01:49:48.917
What the hell!

01:49:56.917 --> 01:49:57.501
Hu!

01:50:04.917 --> 01:50:05.751
Hu!

01:50:06.376 --> 01:50:07.376
Hu!

01:50:18.417 --> 01:50:19.084
Hey you!

01:50:19.542 --> 01:50:22.001
You are really swimming into
the depth of hell aren't you!

01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:25.626
You dirty lovers!

01:50:28.959 --> 01:50:29.834
Where's Hu?

01:50:37.251 --> 01:50:38.001
Where's Hu?

01:50:40.959 --> 01:50:41.876
Say something!

01:50:54.084 --> 01:50:55.042
Fuck!

01:50:57.334 --> 01:51:00.167
You wanna be a hero and live in eternity?

01:51:00.334 --> 01:51:01.084
No god damn way!

01:51:02.417 --> 01:51:03.084
Get out!

01:51:34.292 --> 01:51:35.792
It took me a while down there.

01:51:36.876 --> 01:51:37.876
I went to get something.

01:51:46.084 --> 01:51:47.584
You bastard!

01:51:49.209 --> 01:51:51.001
Are you showing off again?

01:51:51.126 --> 01:51:55.292
Liar! Liar! You said that
we would die together!

01:51:57.209 --> 01:51:59.751
You are not allowed to
leave me alone from now on.

01:52:06.417 --> 01:52:08.209
I'm so useless.

01:52:09.417 --> 01:52:11.917
I can't even save my bro...

01:52:14.001 --> 01:52:15.126
Your bro is here!

01:52:18.959 --> 01:52:20.251
You are alive?

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:22.251
Fuck you!

01:52:22.584 --> 01:52:24.792
Alright, something important
needs to be done.

01:52:24.917 --> 01:52:26.459
What important business would you have?

01:52:26.584 --> 01:52:29.251
You come here and be my witness.

01:52:38.667 --> 01:52:39.584
Miss Shirley Yang

01:52:41.251 --> 01:52:42.251
Would you like to

01:52:43.459 --> 01:52:45.251
subliminate our innocent comradeship

01:52:46.501 --> 01:52:47.709
of revolution ?

01:52:51.584 --> 01:52:53.417
Are you proposing?

01:52:54.084 --> 01:52:55.542
You gotta be kidding me!

01:52:56.376 --> 01:52:57.834
Who's ever proposed in a coffin?

01:52:57.959 --> 01:52:58.959
My treasure!

01:52:59.084 --> 01:52:59.459
Hey!

01:52:59.792 --> 01:53:01.376
It's real gold!

01:53:01.501 --> 01:53:01.959
Give me back!

01:53:02.084 --> 01:53:03.251
I'm gonna make a fortune!

01:53:04.334 --> 01:53:06.001
Young Lady...

01:53:06.126 --> 01:53:07.001
How dare you!

01:53:07.834 --> 01:53:08.584
That was a good one!

01:53:10.251 --> 01:53:11.542
Grill you bastard!

01:53:26.251 --> 01:53:28.042
Or shall we leave it till
we get back to America.

01:53:28.834 --> 01:53:29.876
Are you a real man?

01:53:37.251 --> 01:53:38.626
You two are shameless!

01:53:45.751 --> 01:53:46.417
Mr. Hu.

01:53:47.584 --> 01:53:48.584
Miss Yang.

01:53:53.834 --> 01:53:55.667
What the hell are you doing ?

01:53:56.584 --> 01:53:57.251
Wang Kaixuan

01:54:00.084 --> 01:54:03.626
Mr. Wang here we go again.

01:54:03.751 --> 01:54:05.417
Good timing.

01:54:05.542 --> 01:54:08.001
I thought I would
never see you guys again

01:54:08.459 --> 01:54:10.501
Are we alive or are we dead?

01:54:11.417 --> 01:54:16.084
Are we in Heaven or are we in Hell?

01:54:18.042 --> 01:54:20.042
Whatever you wish!
