00:38.960 --> 00:40.792
He's my daughter's

00:41.080 --> 00:42.434
He's a very gifted geneticist.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.153

you use these as well,

05:51.720 --> 05:53.359

- You searched my quarters?
- Yes, I did.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.520

to follow, too.

it's not a long walk

more than enough

08:51.480 --> 08:52.675
on your plate already.

willing to talk.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.870
I think one of us
needs a clear head

08:59.960 --> 09:01.474
for peace to
really get a chance.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.080
Of course.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.915
Venus was the end of Eros.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.117
I seriously doubt we'll
find anything down there.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.839
If we're lucky.

out of his drop ship.

in the meantime.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.270
Maybe later.

It's time for diplomacy.
We should get going.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.958
I'll be with you
in a moment.

You really believe he hasn't
had any contact

09:35.600 --> 09:37.956

since Eros?

09:38.040 --> 09:40.236
You tell me.
That's your job.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.000
All I can tell you is that he
covers his tracks very well.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.757
And if that ship does find
something on Venus...

09:47.960 --> 09:49.155

I don't mind saying

10:40.240 --> 10:42.277
I'm getting rather excited
about all this.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.760
When I was little, I was
fascinated by stars.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.233
I thought they were magic.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.993
I kept coming up with all
these crazy theories

10:50.080 --> 10:51.480
about how they worked.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.438
I drove my father crazy
with all my questions.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.438
Oh, I'm sure there were
many other reasons.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.320
I wanted to
believe in magic.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.198
Well, you know, that's
normal for a child, right?

10:59.280 --> 11:00.999
That's because children
are stupid.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.400
(CHUCKLES)

11:02.560 --> 11:04.233
When I grew up and learned
the real explanation

11:04.320 --> 11:06.755
for the stars, they
became even more amazing.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.911
Yeah, I have a feeling I know
where you're going with this.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.675
You're a very
intelligent man.

11:10.760 --> 11:11.955
Oh, hey, thank you.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.033
But you seem to think that everybody
else around you is stupid.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.236
Just some.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.473
Just because you can't figure
something out

11:18.560 --> 11:20.438
doesn't make it magic.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.473
What do you think Eros
left behind on Venus?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.358
Little grey humanoids
with big black eyes

11:25.440 --> 11:27.113
who've come to turn us
into food?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.435
I'm astonished that Avasarala
didn't kick you out of her office.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.034
Well, you know,
just between the two of us,

11:32.120 --> 11:33.713
she's kind of got
a thing for me, right?

11:33.800 --> 11:36.520
Earth and Mars are mobilizing
for war as we speak.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.034
They have better
weapons than we do,

11:38.120 --> 11:39.873
and Eros was one of them.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.360
You sleazed your way
into this mission,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.272
determined to justify
your own theories.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.036
You're gonna twist the facts
to support your position.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.634
That's not just bad science...

11:48.280 --> 11:49.714
It's dangerous.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.916

Colonel, we just picked up

I don't know why we didn't
see this before.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.990
It must be in stealth.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.072
From the drive signature,
probably a destroyer.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.192
They were waiting for us.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.557
I'm not seeing any changes in
the MCRN Ganymede patrols,

12:15.640 --> 12:18.109
and it doesn't look like
we've attracted

12:18.200 --> 12:19.714
any attention so far.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.593
Good, at least we got
that much right.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.676
- Keep a close watch.
<i>- I always do.</i>

12:25.240 --> 12:27.277
Not my first rodeo, Chief.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.512
Right, I need the hand
terminals, please.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.160
SANTICHAI:
Why are you doing this?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.517
'Cause we need a ship to get
us onto Ganymede station

12:39.760 --> 12:41.194
and ours is too conspicuous.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.039
The people there
are suffering, you know.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.960
These supplies
can save lives.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.675
And they'll get where they're needed.
I promise.

and everyone else.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.356
Whether you believe it or not.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.000
Boy, this ship is a
grade-A piece of shit,

13:03.720 --> 13:05.439
but she'll get us to Ganymede.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.239
Wouldn't bet on her
in a race, though.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.198
Have any of you been
to Ganymede recently?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.033
No. Never.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.998
The station is a mess.

If you tell us what you're
doing there or what you want,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.113
- maybe we could help...
- No, thank you.

Hello.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.597
My name is Praxideke Meng.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.716
You don't know me,
but I was a colleague...

13:29.800 --> 13:31.678
I was a friend
of your cousin Doris.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.393
<i>We worked together
on Ganymede.</i>

13:37.400 --> 13:39.073
<i>She saved my life.</i>

13:39.400 --> 13:41.676
She got me out of the station,
when the mirrors fell.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.076
She was on her way back to Mars,
to be with you, but...

13:48.160 --> 13:49.958
She was badly injured
in transit,

13:52.040 --> 13:53.520
and she died.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.072
<i>She probably wouldn't have
even been on the ship with me</i>

13:57.160 --> 13:59.117
<i>if she hadn't helped me.</i>

14:00.920 --> 14:02.991
<i>So I want to say I'm sorry.</i>

14:03.480 --> 14:05.358
She was a good person.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.472
I promise I'll never
forget her,

14:11.920 --> 14:13.912
nor what she did for me.

14:14.840 --> 14:15.910
Ever.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.800
(BEEPS)

14:27.160 --> 14:28.355
(BEEPS)

14:30.480 --> 14:31.709
(BEEPS)

14:34.480 --> 14:35.630
Amos?

14:36.520 --> 14:37.920
Amos!

14:38.000 --> 14:39.320
- (BEEPING)
- Amos!

14:40.960 --> 14:42.155
(SIGHS)

15:10.680 --> 15:12.034
(DOOR OPENS)

15:13.600 --> 15:15.319
You didn't answer me
when I called.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.354
I was busy.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.636
Come on,
we need you upstairs.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.234
No. I need to send a message.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.755
- You can't.
- It's important.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.395
That doesn't make
a difference.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.874
Why can't I?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.955
Cap said.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.879
Am I a prisoner?

15:33.840 --> 15:35.479
I don't think so.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.033
Then I have the right
to know why.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.831
And I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.479
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:54.640 --> 15:56.711
SADAVIR: Sorry we weren't able
to land you at night

15:56.800 --> 16:00.032
and spare you the shock
of our sun and sky,

16:00.360 --> 16:02.875
but the Navy had fly-over
restrictions in effect.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.672
I hope the strain of
Earth's gravity hasn't been

16:05.760 --> 16:06.796
too much
for you to bear.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.600
Not at all.
I was a Marine for 45 years.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.558
We trained extensively
in one G.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.875
It's like riding a bike.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.957
With tires made of lead.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.834
(CHUCKLING)

16:19.240 --> 16:22.119
It's nice to be having
an actual conversation,

16:22.200 --> 16:23.839
instead of trading
recordings for once.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.552
It would've been even nicer
if you had met us halfway.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.914
(CHUCKLES)

16:36.280 --> 16:37.396
The Secretary-General
would like to

16:37.480 --> 16:39.233
formally extend
his greetings.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.199
The Prime Minister
does the same.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.151
CHRISJEN: Perhaps we should
begin with a moment of silence

16:44.240 --> 16:46.709
for the lives
lost on Ganymede.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.280
Of course.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.673
It's important to remember
the terrible cost of battle.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.035
In victory or defeat.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.395
That's a good thing
to keep in mind.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.994
You should spread it
to your fleet.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.113
Maybe you could tell them when our ships
get to Jupiter. It won't take long.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.834
We're looking forward to it.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.273
The reason we're here
is to prevent a war.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.592
Let's start by
remembering the fallen.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.438
SADAVIR: So the issue at hand
is de-escalation.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.550
Let's get right to it.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.878
We have a lot
on our agenda.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.035
MAN: <i>Five-seven-three,
declination is locked in.</i>

17:39.760 --> 17:41.911
WOMAN: <i>Running a diagnostic
on the solar reflection field.</i>

17:42.840 --> 17:43.876
The Martians are
not responding

17:44.000 --> 17:45.275
to any of our hails.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.113
JANUS: They're trying to
scare us away.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.398
Oh, they have no more idea
what's going on than we do.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.960
Or, they were
prepared in advance

17:52.040 --> 17:54.157
to collect data on the field
test of their new weapon.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.913
You can't dismiss
the possibility.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.560
Well, even if that were true,
there's no way they're gonna open fire on us

17:58.680 --> 17:59.750
when they're in the
middle of peace talks.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.593
What exactly are you
basing that on?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.632
The restraint they showed
when they destroyed

18:03.720 --> 18:05.040
seven of our ships
over Ganymede?

18:05.120 --> 18:07.351
We lost over 500 soldiers
protecting a farm.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.837
Are there any other
MCRN ships in the area?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.356
No, sir.
But with their stealth tech

18:13.560 --> 18:15.074
there could be.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.834
JANUS:
Put me on broadcast, please.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.750
You're on.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.359
To all vessels
in the area,

18:23.440 --> 18:26.000
this is the
<i>UNS Arboghast.</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:29.552
We are an unarmed research
vessel on a scientific mission

18:29.640 --> 18:31.711
as is our right
under the Venus Accords.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.677
Any interference
with our operations

18:34.800 --> 18:36.951
may be considered
an act of war.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.319
<i>Arboghast</i> out.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.839
Take us in.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.311
PILOT: All hands make ready
for Venus orbit.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.949
HOLDEN: Dr. Strickland pulled
your daughter

18:55.040 --> 18:57.032
out of the clinic an hour
before the battle started.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.993
If he's still on Ganymede
and we find him,

18:59.080 --> 19:00.116
I believe we'll
find your daughter.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.152
You can stop pretending
to care about my daughter.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.316
What does she
have to do with this

19:04.400 --> 19:05.800
protomolecule you're after?

19:05.880 --> 19:07.030
How do you know about that?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.474
AMOS: I told him.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.120
He's helping us.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.554
We should be
straight with him.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.597
The protomolecule,
is that what really moved Eros?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.919
We were all there,
my friend.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.639
We saw it
with our own eyes.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.674
What could that have
to do with Mei?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.399
We don't know yet.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.191
But if it is there,
the threat could be even worse than Eros.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.797
We're gonna do everything
we can to find your daughter.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.599
What was Strickland
treating her for?

19:36.960 --> 19:38.519
She has a genetic disorder.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.990
Myers-Skelton Premature
Immunosenescence.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.395
We're not quite sure
what causes it.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.597
Mei developed a very serious
spinal infection

19:45.760 --> 19:47.831
when she was four months old.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.593
She would've died
if we'd been anywhere else.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.433
But Ganymede has a
natural magnetosphere,

19:51.720 --> 19:53.473
that's why everybody
goes there to gestate.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.199
Pediatric care is
state-of-the-art.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.920
The moment Dr. Strickland
saw her,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.480
he knew exactly
what was wrong.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.836
He gave her
regular injections.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.874
He kept her alive.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.679
That can't be a coincidence.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.750
I don't get it.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.390
Uh, that proto crap
and a genetic disease.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.840
What's the connection?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.718
Well, we'll ask Strickland
when we find him.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.399
Half the station's in ruins.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.790
Its infrastructure
network's smashed.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.314
How are we supposed to
find anyone there?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.312
Well, the first step is
getting there.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.834
We'll leave the <i>Somnabulist</i>
once we dock

20:23.920 --> 20:25.798
and then we'll intermingle
with the locals.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.155
PRAX: And then?

20:27.240 --> 20:28.799
And then we'll
assess the situation

20:28.960 --> 20:30.360
and take it from there.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.438
Are your plans
always this vague?

20:32.520 --> 20:34.398
This is about average.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.154
You all must be very lucky.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.435
We've certainly had our
fair share.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.715
Hey.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.593
If we leave the <i>Somnabulist</i>
after we land,

20:40.680 --> 20:42.433
how are we supposed
to get back?

20:42.760 --> 20:45.958
Plan A is hitching a ride
to an outgoing relief ship.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.880
- Plan B...
- That'd be me.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.394
So the MCRN,
they're gonna be focused

20:51.520 --> 20:53.193
on all the incoming
UNN warships.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.676
That's gonna be good for us.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.830
I'm gonna use
that distraction,

20:55.920 --> 20:57.400
I'm gonna take the <i>Roci</i>
and mosey on down

20:57.480 --> 20:58.960
to the dark side of Ganymede.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.599
Once I'm there,
I'm gonna tuck her

21:00.880 --> 21:03.839
behind one of those
71 cute little moons.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.439
And then I'll wait.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.398
So if anything goes south
down there,

21:08.480 --> 21:10.756
y'all just holler,
cavalry will come running.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.277
I'll quietly de-orbit,
no burn, hug the surface,

21:14.360 --> 21:17.797
and we'll rendezvous at one of
these service air locks here.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.193
I'll scoop you up
and we'll strap in

21:20.280 --> 21:22.317
for a max-burn up and out.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.395
With every torpedo that
every MCRN ship in orbit

21:25.480 --> 21:27.312
can launch heading
straight at us.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.510
Yep.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.919
That's your plan?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.552
I hope your luck rubs off.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.070
Mirror.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.479
Window, clear.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.550
Close.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.478
One of the few things
not in dispute

22:31.600 --> 22:34.877
is that the battle on
Ganymede began on the ground.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.272
But per your request,

22:37.480 --> 22:39.278
we have brought in
the lone survivor

22:39.360 --> 22:41.397
of the surface engagement.

22:41.520 --> 22:44.638
This is Marine Gunnery
Sergeant Roberta Draper.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.872
She will be giving you
her account of the battle.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.114
And in the interests
of transparency,

22:52.320 --> 22:55.438
you're welcome to examine
her power armor as well.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.873
Its systems were
badly damaged,

22:57.960 --> 23:00.873
but the logs will corroborate
our time line of the events,

23:00.960 --> 23:02.440
to the extent that they can.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.278
Thank you.
I'm sure that will all be very informative.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.879
Sergeant Draper.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.390
Sir.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.914
My fire team was assigned to
patrol the MCRN zone Bravo

23:16.040 --> 23:17.190
on Ganymede Station.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.270
Shortly after the <i>Scirocco,</i>

23:19.360 --> 23:22.353
our support ship,
went into comms blackout,

23:23.640 --> 23:25.916
we observed movements
on the UNN line,

23:26.000 --> 23:27.434
approximately
two kilometers distance

23:28.520 --> 23:30.159
and weapons fire.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.237
The UN Marines appeared
to be charging our position...

23:33.320 --> 23:35.118
So you're saying that we
opened fire on you?

23:35.200 --> 23:36.429
No, sir.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.910
We were out of contact with our
ship and unable to confirm.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.720
And at that time our comms
were jammed on the field.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.678
WOMAN: Is it possible
that your Marines were

23:43.760 --> 23:47.356
testing their gear or conducting
some sort of training exercise?

23:47.880 --> 23:49.394
It's possible.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.757
We also had lost
contact with our unit.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.596
My team formed a firing line
and prepared to engage

23:56.680 --> 23:58.194
if the Blues...

23:59.040 --> 24:00.713
The UN Marines crossed
500 meters,

24:00.800 --> 24:02.917
which would've put them
on our side of the zone.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.518
They were closing in
on us fast.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.390
We mistook a training exercise
as an active engagement

24:12.480 --> 24:14.437
and opened fire
without orders.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.311
As commander of the fire team,

24:22.400 --> 24:24.551
the responsibility is mine.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.752
The battle on the surface is
what precipitated

24:26.840 --> 24:28.479
the battle in orbit.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.153
That's what devastated
Ganymede Station.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.396
That's on you, too.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.955
According to our
investigation,

24:33.040 --> 24:38.513
it was Private Richard Travis
that fired the first shot.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.710
WOMAN: He was
born on Earth,

24:39.800 --> 24:41.598
his parents emigrated to Mars

24:41.680 --> 24:43.319
when he was a child.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.392
He'd had some discipline
problems recently,

24:45.640 --> 24:47.632
which suggest he might've
been trying to prove

24:47.720 --> 24:49.632
that he was more Martian
than Earther.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.436
And what better way to do that
than to take out

24:52.760 --> 24:54.240
some Earthers.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.717
We appreciate your candor.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.717
Thank you,
Sergeant Draper.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.311
We can't change
what happened,

25:10.400 --> 25:13.040
but we can move forward
in the effort of peace.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.238
Ganymede Station is an
important food supply

25:16.320 --> 25:18.232
outside of Earth and Mars,

25:18.320 --> 25:19.959
and it's in neither
of our interests

25:20.080 --> 25:21.833
to leave it crippled.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.431
We're willing to
discuss reparations.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.277
They didn't have to say
all that crap about Travis.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.079
Why didn't you tell me
they were gonna say that?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.310
Because I knew you'd
react like this.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.390
Travis was a good soldier.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.880
He died for Mars.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.031
And you all just threw
him into the goddamn crusher.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.793
Travis did die for Mars.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.600
And if that story stops a
war that we do not want,

25:45.680 --> 25:47.114
then he died a hero.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.431
You did well
in there, Gunny.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.632
The hard part's over.
You can relax now.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.878
You'll be going home soon.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.792
Try to focus on that.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.992
GUNNY: Open the shades.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.879
Open all of them.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.913
<i>Mars offering reparation will
play well for us, of course.</i>

26:24.360 --> 26:26.397
<i>They must've been thrilled
when they realized</i>

26:26.520 --> 26:28.637
<i>the one who fired the first
shot was born on Earth.</i>

26:29.000 --> 26:30.719
It'll let them save face
back home.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.359
How would you like us
to proceed?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.839
<i>Squeeze the arrogant Dusters for
everything you can get, of course.</i>

26:36.400 --> 26:37.834
With pleasure, sir.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.998
This young man is
a perfect scapegoat.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.600
Almost purpose-built.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.993
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth, Chrisjen.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.433
I never understood
that idiotic phrase.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.315
Mars won a battle that they
didn't intend to fight,

26:53.400 --> 26:55.471
and they know now that
they can't win the war,

26:55.560 --> 26:57.552
so they let us stick them
with the bill for Ganymede.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.270
No one's completely happy,

26:59.360 --> 27:01.238
but everyone comes out
of it with something.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.915
You know
what that's called?

27:03.320 --> 27:04.834
Horse trading.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.595
Cowboys,

27:32.880 --> 27:34.075
lasagna!

27:37.280 --> 27:39.397
I really put my foot
in this batch, partner.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.999
I think you're gonna like it.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.833
You be careful down there,
Earther.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.357
Be careful up here,
Martian.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.235
You, too.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.431
<i>Somnabulist,</i> docking bridge
is clear.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.680
<i>Roci</i> and I will be ready
and waiting for your call.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.557
Maintain full radio silence
until we do.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.599
God speed, cowboys.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.956
See you soon.
<i>Somnabulist</i> out.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.638
You're gonna get us
all killed.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.912
And lastly, the MCR will
cover 61.5% of the costs

28:39.000 --> 28:40.992
to repair the ag domes
and orbital mirrors,

28:41.520 --> 28:43.113
with the exception
of any damage

28:43.240 --> 28:45.152
that can be definitely
and solely linked

28:45.240 --> 28:46.640
to UNN actions,

28:46.720 --> 28:49.235
in which case we'll
split the costs 50-50.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.635
- (SCOFFS)
- (NGUYEN CHUCKLES)

28:51.640 --> 28:53.393
PENANO: That's a fair deal.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.199
We wouldn't have
damaged anything

28:55.280 --> 28:57.033
if you hadn't precipitated
the battle.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.998
I suppose we could pay
for it all,

28:59.120 --> 29:01.396
in exchange for full control
of Ganymede.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.233
I think that covers
everything.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.959
SADAVIR: Almost.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.874
We're going to need a
statement from your government

29:07.960 --> 29:09.394
accepting responsibility.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.200
You're not gonna get one.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.999
Never hurts to ask.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.070
(SCOFFS)

29:16.160 --> 29:17.913
All right then.
So we're done.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.992
CHRISJEN: One last thing.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.476
I'd like to speak
to Sergeant Draper again.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.433
I have a few questions.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.796
Just little things
I need her to clarify.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.634
Madam, this has been
an exhausting session.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.155
I find it hard to believe
that a Martian Marine

29:32.240 --> 29:34.516
would be fatigued
from sitting in a chair.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.752
We all came here
in the hopes that we could

29:37.880 --> 29:39.917
begin to trust each other.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.154
And it would be regrettable to
undo the progress we've made

29:43.240 --> 29:45.072
over something
as trivial as this.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.316
I want to speak with
Sergeant Draper.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.030
Now.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.199
CHRISJEN:
Sergeant Draper,

29:59.280 --> 30:02.034
my family has a long tradition
of military service.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.998
I'm sure yours does, too.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.514
GUNNY: All Martians serve.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.240
Oh, I know.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.273
But it's compulsory.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.155
Tell me,

30:11.240 --> 30:13.880
if you could choose,
would you still serve?

30:14.400 --> 30:15.629
Yes, ma'am.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.515
CHRISJEN: Why?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.717
I want to do my part to make
Mars a new Earth.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.994
An entire nation dedicated
to a common goal.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.919
To turn a lifeless rock
into a garden.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.957
A dear friend told me that.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.997
He wanted to retire to Mars.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.514
But he died.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.917
Did you know that the
majority of people on Earth

30:39.000 --> 30:40.434
don't have jobs?

30:40.520 --> 30:42.432
They don't work at all.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.675
They live on Basic Assistance,
which the government provides.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.193
I did know that.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.275
You call them "takers,"
I believe.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.200
Yes, ma'am.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.671
It's not that they're lazy,
you know.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.120
It's just that we can't give
them enough opportunities.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.112
In this building it's easy
to forget...

31:03.200 --> 31:04.680
With all due respect, Madam,

31:04.800 --> 31:05.790
where are you going with this?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.917
Wherever I goddamn like.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.950
Travis' parents, they
believed in your dream.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.556
They gave up everything
to go to Mars,

31:20.200 --> 31:22.760
to provide a better life
for their only son.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.200
I'm sure Travis believed
in that dream, as well.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.595
He did.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.792
Were other Martians
prejudiced against him?

31:31.880 --> 31:33.678
For being from Earth.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.870
Yes.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.559
Was he a good soldier?

31:42.160 --> 31:43.674
One of my best.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.632
Do you really believe that
after all that sacrifice,

31:47.720 --> 31:49.518
and all his training,

31:49.600 --> 31:51.512
the training that
made him, as you said,

31:51.600 --> 31:53.557
one of your best soldiers,

31:53.680 --> 31:56.559
do you believe,
after all that hard work,

31:56.640 --> 31:57.869
that Travis would jeopardize

31:57.960 --> 32:00.236
the lives of his
fellow soldiers

32:00.320 --> 32:02.312
by foolishly jumping the gun?

32:02.840 --> 32:06.834
- No, I...
- No, then why would he open fire without orders?

32:07.160 --> 32:08.674
Did he panic?

32:09.040 --> 32:10.872
I don't know.
He... (STAMMERS)

32:10.960 --> 32:12.997
- Then why did he fire?
- We...

32:13.080 --> 32:14.639
What was the reason?

32:14.720 --> 32:16.120
We thought we were
under attack.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.634
Under attack?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.197
So you were fired upon?

32:20.480 --> 32:23.393
No! He was trying to
kill the enemy.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.959
I didn't even know
what it was, nobody did.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.269
He wasn't wearing
a vac suit...

32:27.360 --> 32:28.999
Sergeant Draper has
been through

32:29.080 --> 32:31.640
a severe traumatic event.
She needs to rest.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.434
Whoever the fuck you are,
stand down

32:34.520 --> 32:35.874
and let her speak.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.157
Unless there's something
you don't want her to say.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.711
Do as you've been instructed,
Sergeant.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.233
Sergeant Draper,

32:55.960 --> 32:57.917
what made you open fire?

33:04.200 --> 33:05.395
(SIGHS)

33:06.680 --> 33:08.239
It was Travis.

33:09.440 --> 33:10.874
He panicked.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.072
Has Sergeant Draper answered
all of your questions, Madam?

33:21.920 --> 33:24.719
Thank you, Sergeant.
That will be all.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.871
PILOT: The Martians are giving
us a fair berth

33:36.200 --> 33:39.318
but they've matched every one of
our course changes precisely.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.598
JANUS: The bastards
are shadowing us.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.672
How much further to the Eros
impact site?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.319
WOMAN: Uh, it's tough to
tell through this atmosphere,

33:45.400 --> 33:47.278
but I don't think
it'll be much longer.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.954
What is that?

33:57.240 --> 33:59.152
Well, it's just a bit of
science history.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.197
It's the Drake Equation.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.638
It looks like
sixth-grade algebra.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.519
The average rate of
star formation

34:07.920 --> 34:10.230
times the fraction
of stars formed

34:10.360 --> 34:12.237
with planets that could
support life,

34:12.639 --> 34:14.597
the fraction of those
that could develop life

34:15.320 --> 34:17.391
and then intelligent life,
the fraction of those

34:17.480 --> 34:19.072
that could develop
technologies that

34:19.199 --> 34:21.635
might release detectable
signals into space,

34:21.719 --> 34:23.393
and, of course,
the time over which

34:23.480 --> 34:25.199
those signals might
be detectable.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.553
That's not an equation.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.518
That's just a big, fat guess.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.069
It suggests there are
over 36 million

34:33.159 --> 34:34.913
advanced civilizations
out there.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.150
Doing all kinds of things
that we just don't understand.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.159
If that were true,
we would've detected signals by now.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.230
Not necessarily.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.437
Space is a big, empty place.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.592
We might be too far apart,

34:45.679 --> 34:47.558
or perhaps they're just
broadcasting the signals

34:47.639 --> 34:49.597
- for too short a time.
- How convenient.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.520
Those things that we're
looking for out there,

34:52.600 --> 34:55.559
those things might be signals.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.833
Or maybe all those other
civilizations are gone.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.073
Maybe it's the nature
of intelligent life

35:01.200 --> 35:02.839
to destroy itself.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.759
Well, I prefer to think

35:05.840 --> 35:07.638
that intelligent life
can choose not to.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.238
More magical thinking.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.199
WOMAN: Colonel.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.070
Stop.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.430
Hold it.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.034
Go in on that.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.634
What is that?

35:28.200 --> 35:29.873
JANUS: Jesus.

on every ship on Ganymede,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.229
and keep your ears peeled,

36:42.320 --> 36:44.277
monitor every MCRN band
and broadcast,

36:44.360 --> 36:45.999

It doesn't have to be,
not with us here.

I'm sure we could
convince 'em to...

37:36.360 --> 37:38.352
I don't want you doing
a goddamn thing.

37:39.640 --> 37:40.994
I know your type.

You're on a crusade.

So go save the world,

(ALARM BLARING)

38:08.800 --> 38:10.871
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

38:21.560 --> 38:23.552
Reminds me of Baltimore.

38:44.160 --> 38:45.879
MAN: Yep, you
gotta like this, boss.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.838
Rice and beans
and medical supply.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.910
Gonna be a nice haul...

38:49.120 --> 38:50.634
Our agreement was 10%.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.717
Take 20, skim the best.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.512
But these supplies,
they're desperately needed...

38:56.600 --> 38:58.034
Yeah, by us.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.758
See, this time we're taking
all of the cargo

39:02.400 --> 39:03.834
and the ship.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.754
<i>"Weeping Somnabulist."</i>
I like that.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.560
If I have to board one more
ship named after some kid

39:10.640 --> 39:12.632
or girl who got left behind

39:12.720 --> 39:14.359
after a magic weekend
on Titan,

39:14.440 --> 39:15.715
I might just shoot some people

39:15.800 --> 39:17.439
for general lack
of creativity.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.316
We were thinking of naming
her after our goldfish.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.395
You're funny.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.278
Most people are just
scared shitless of us.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.554
And this slab of meat...

39:26.640 --> 39:27.790
I think he had
his sense of humor

39:27.880 --> 39:29.394
chemically removed.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.790
Now, are you gonna call
the harbor master

39:31.880 --> 39:33.633
and get us clearance
to leave, or not?

39:33.720 --> 39:35.632
All right, all right,
we have a deal.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.915
We got company!

40:06.080 --> 40:07.150
HOLDEN: They were
going to kill you.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.435
We had to do something.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.520
NAOMI: Holden!

40:13.240 --> 40:14.310
Amos!

40:14.840 --> 40:16.160
All clear!

40:17.320 --> 40:19.516

Oh, my God.

(MELISSA SOBBING)

40:34.520 --> 40:35.874
Naomi, the cockpit's wrecked.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.633
See if you can get
the flight controls back up.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.350
Okay.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.240
Please...

40:42.600 --> 40:43.636
Go!

40:44.080 --> 40:45.912
Or I'll call
the harbor master,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.195
or the Martians,

40:47.280 --> 40:49.511
or whoever it takes
to make you leave!

40:50.520 --> 40:52.273
Get off my ship!

40:53.520 --> 40:54.670
Go!
