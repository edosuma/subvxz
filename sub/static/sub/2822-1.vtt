00:27.394 --> 00:28.961
            Damn it!

00:42.275 --> 00:45.277
             Hello?

00:45.712 --> 00:46.879
              Hey.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.014
            Gretel?

00:49.016 --> 00:51.050
          Still open?

00:51.052 --> 00:53.352
      Gretel, it's Mason.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.821
           You here?

00:56.589 --> 00:58.624
You, uh, wouldn't happen to have

00:58.626 --> 01:02.761
     any of those meat pies
        left, would you?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.431
  I'm just going to leave this

01:05.433 --> 01:07.599
money right here on the counter.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.868
             Okay?

01:18.045 --> 01:19.678
            Oh crap.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.792
            Gretel?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.962
           Ahh. Crap!

01:39.433 --> 01:41.033
          Hey, pussy.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.103
             Whoa!

01:52.412 --> 01:55.447
Ahh!

04:36.776 --> 04:39.144
            Gotcha.

04:48.087 --> 04:51.290
    You remember me, right?

04:51.292 --> 04:57.362
Poughkeepsie. Dayton. Stamford.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.701
 You got to remember Stamford.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.570
 You got me with the gas trap.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.675
  Spent two weeks in the ICU.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.677
        That shit hurt.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.880
       But not this time.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.092
         Do you smoke?

05:29.862 --> 05:34.166
   I say we fucking find out.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.319
          You're good.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.688
      You're really good.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.292
   No flinching. I like that.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.995
Please. Why are you doing this?

06:04.997 --> 06:07.366
         You know why.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.601
    I want the little girls.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.938
       What little girls?
 What kind of pervert are you?

06:12.940 --> 06:15.874
       I don't know what
the hell you are talking about.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.711
       Please, let me go.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.613
           Hmmm...no.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.115
    See, I'm not buying it.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.549
      See, I've been doing
      this for a while now

06:24.551 --> 06:28.787
and I've developed a sixth sense
   for these kind of things.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.224
       And you and me? We
     get to tussle I think.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.525
  Listen, I don't know who you

06:33.527 --> 06:37.929
       think I am or what
  I've done but you're wrong.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.864
  Please, if you let me go now

06:38.866 --> 06:41.133
    I don't say anything to
            anybody.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.968
           I promise.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.036
I'll keep it between you and me.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.071
We can play these games all you

06:46.073 --> 06:49.074
       want but I do not
        have all day and

06:49.076 --> 06:52.644
    I think you know exactly
        what that means.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.679
        You really don't
        want to do this.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.351
          I really do.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.888
- Oh God.
-        You're so stupid.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.425
          How's that?

07:15.101 --> 07:18.570
       Who's stupid now?

07:40.026 --> 07:40.959
             Hello?

07:47.433 --> 07:49.301
   It's okay, little ladies.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.736
  I'm coming down. I'm Hansel.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.939
   I'm one of the good guys.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.224
            Oh shit.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.027
            Gretel.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.033
            Come on.
            Come on.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.098
    Uh, hey. There's a line.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.936
My sister owns the place. Relax.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.120
            Hansel?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.388
       The one and only.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.390
           Oh my God!

09:52.392 --> 09:54.926
       It's been a year.
    What are you doing here?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.462
      Where have you been?

09:57.464 --> 09:59.097
      Why didn't you call?

09:59.099 --> 10:01.099
             I did.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.135
  Oh, I'm sorry. The bakery's
 just been so busy and I didn't
     know how to reach you.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.904
     Look, we need to talk.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.238
       Gretel, my coffee.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.008
 Oh right! Just a jiff, Margie!

10:11.144 --> 10:13.078
   Yeah, just a jiff, Margie.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.981
       Hey, who are you?

10:22.888 --> 10:24.589
Lilith's meat pies?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.858
        You've got to be
      fucking kidding me.

10:26.860 --> 10:31.363
        Hansel! They're
       the best sellers.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.966
  They're not the same, okay?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.101
      And I'd like to have
        you for dinner.

10:36.103 --> 10:40.105
       You're staying at
       the house, right?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.007
           Thank you.

10:50.449 --> 10:54.919
         Mmm! Grandma,
  everything tastes so great!

10:54.921 --> 10:58.056
     I made your favorite,
       ribs and potatoes.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.458
   Grand's been doing all of
  the cooking since Dad died.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.326
       I don't know what
      I would have done if

11:01.328 --> 11:04.429
  she hadn't moved back here.

11:04.431 --> 11:08.033
   You know I'm really sorry
    that I couldn't make it
     home for his funeral.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.235
     You know, I was just-
            - Busy.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.203
            We know.

11:14.140 --> 11:18.009
      So, Sweetheart, how
   is life out on the street?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.412
             Grand!

11:20.414 --> 11:24.215
Grandma, come on! You're making
it sound like I sell my body on

11:24.217 --> 11:25.483
         the streets or
      something like that.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.153
   Well, how am I supposed to
       know what you do?

11:28.155 --> 11:32.323
      You never call. You
       could use a bath.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.592
      We worry about you.

11:34.594 --> 11:40.665
      Well, listen, if you
    really want to know I've
     been killing witches.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.868
              Oh.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.205
  Yeah. I beheaded one down in
 Florida, crushed one to death

11:47.207 --> 11:51.943
    with my van at the Grand
    Canyon, lit a couple on
       fire in Portland.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.179
    Smelled something awful.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.181
      And most recently I
cut the, uh, insides out of this

11:56.183 --> 11:59.551
   teenage demon cheerleader.

11:59.553 --> 12:05.690
 All in all, I've had my hands
  pretty busy trying to catch
     these evil creatures.

12:05.692 --> 12:10.595
Well, not all witches are evil.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.998
      Of course, Grandma.
       But the good ones,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.102
       they don't really
        get on my radar.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.306
          More juice?

12:21.308 --> 12:24.375
            Please.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.667
Smile for me, pretty girl.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.705
      Good night, Grandma.

12:54.608 --> 12:58.276
 Honestly, what is up with her?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.745
       She's getting old.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.747
No, there's got to be something
    else going on with her.

13:02.749 --> 13:08.486
      Here. You dry. Like
      the good, old days.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.258
 So what brings you back here?

13:13.260 --> 13:15.126
             Mason.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.362
 Oh, you found out about that.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.397
 Yeah, I found out about that.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.333
       Gretel, six people
       have gone missing.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.203
 You didn't think it was a good
      idea to let me know.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.806
        I was going to,
      Hansel, I wanted to.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.176
       But I didn't know
      where to reach you!

13:31.178 --> 13:37.282
      I figured people run
    away from home, parents,
relationships, all of the time.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.051
       And then I thought
    it was nothing but then-

13:40.053 --> 13:43.388
   Mason is a grown ass man.
     He's not going to just
      run away from home.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.123
            I know.

13:46.726 --> 13:51.663
      I think I know what
       happened to Mason.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.599
The morning after he disappeared

13:54.601 --> 13:58.236
I went to the bakery and the rug

13:58.238 --> 14:02.674
   was just covered in blood.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.642
             What?

14:04.644 --> 14:08.746
  I thought about going to the
 police but after what happened
    to us with Lilith. And--

14:10.383 --> 14:13.518
      They didn't leave me
       alone for months.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.187
       I just grabbed the
      rug and I tossed it.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.625
   Lilith was gone. They were
   going to think it was me.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.126
    Well I can tell you from
 personal experience there's a

14:22.128 --> 14:26.164
 hell of a lot more Liliths out
  there than you can imagine.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.536
 This can't be starting again.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.404
 Gretel, look, we've got to get

14:33.406 --> 14:35.506
     to the bottom of this.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.475
        Okay? But I need
        you to trust me.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.943
             Yeah.

14:38.945 --> 14:44.148
   First thing in the morning
 we're going to Mason's house.

14:44.150 --> 14:48.219
   Hey. I'm glad you're back.

15:46.312 --> 15:49.948
       Tastes like magic.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.483
      She's here and she's
   taken our sister's place.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.286
Greedy bitch. We'll liquefy her.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.556
  We've got to find her first.

15:58.558 --> 16:03.227
          You! Devils!

16:03.229 --> 16:04.629
    Rotting, filthy devils!

16:07.366 --> 16:09.701
 She's smarter than she looks.

16:09.703 --> 16:13.771
        Well you did say
     you needed a new pet.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.569
       You couldn't find
    a better place to hide?

16:44.571 --> 16:45.703
    Lilith's cabin is just-

16:45.705 --> 16:49.340
      She will protect us.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.845
        No one will see.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.948
 There's a strong energy here.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.683
     What did you find out?

16:58.685 --> 17:04.689
       I was right. That
   little girl is still here.

17:09.728 --> 17:14.464
      Oh, she's a friend.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.268
    She'll be useful to us.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.738
She'll help us track them down.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.306
       What's for dinner?

17:22.308 --> 17:25.309
   Just the usual. Long pig.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.511
        Baby back ribs?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.282
             Yummy.

17:58.911 --> 18:05.216
      Tell me, Dear. Tell
    me everything you know.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.525
     Do you remember which
       apartment he's at?

18:14.527 --> 18:16.694
        Seven, I think.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.963
        Oh, right here.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.967
    He's missing. Remember?

18:22.969 --> 18:25.336
           What now?

18:31.978 --> 18:34.045
How'd you learn how to do that?

18:34.047 --> 18:39.016
      Let's just say it's
    been one hell of a year.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.587
 So if he was taken by a witch,

18:42.589 --> 18:46.390
what exactly are we looking for?

18:46.392 --> 18:48.526
         I'm not sure.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.696
 We all got to start somewhere.

18:58.537 --> 19:02.640
  He was my favorite customer.

19:16.922 --> 19:20.358
       Do you smell that?

19:27.065 --> 19:29.567
             Hello?

19:30.836 --> 19:33.971
          Anyone home?

19:54.593 --> 19:56.527
              Ugh!

19:57.162 --> 19:58.329
          What is it?

19:58.331 --> 20:01.065
You don't
       want to see this.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.678
          It's Frank!

20:13.680 --> 20:16.013
What?

20:16.015 --> 20:20.384
  It's Mason's rabbit. Frank.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.655
      He was such a sweet
         little rabbit.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.558
    Who could've done this?

20:38.037 --> 20:41.005
      So what's the plan?

20:41.007 --> 20:43.007
       You still talk to
     Mason's brother Jacob?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.710
Sometimes. Not too often though.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.613
    He lives with Willy now.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.249
          With Willy?

20:51.251 --> 20:55.019
      Ugh, man. I haven't
  thought about her in years.

20:55.021 --> 21:00.625
       Is she, uh, she's
      doing alright then?

21:00.627 --> 21:01.859
             Yeah.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.129
      Hansel, you've been
     gone for a long time.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.699
      Things have changed.

21:10.736 --> 21:13.271
      Does she still live
   in the same place though?

21:13.273 --> 21:15.539
             Yeah.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.827
      Maybe he's at work.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.198
         You hear that?

21:56.916 --> 21:59.717
Don't run. It's all good.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.657
       They're eating us.
They're going to eat all of us.

22:06.659 --> 22:10.194
 They're going to eat you too.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.831
Don't you see that?

22:13.833 --> 22:17.635
Lunch.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.671
       What's she trying
     to do. Steal the tire?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.640
      Well she's not going
        to be much help.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.675
          I guess not.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.976
        Man, she looked
      familiar. Was that-

22:25.978 --> 22:27.144
          Mrs. Klima.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.679
      That was Mrs. Klima?

22:28.681 --> 22:31.382
       From kindergarten?

22:31.384 --> 22:32.783
 What the hell happened to her?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.085
          She's crazy.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.987
     Hey! What are you two-

22:36.989 --> 22:40.191
        Gretel? Hansel?

22:40.193 --> 22:41.659
           Hi Jacob.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.762
        What's up, man?

22:44.764 --> 22:47.698
     Hey, I'm really sorry
      about your brother.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.234
       I mean, hopefully
  he's going to show up soon.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.237
 Thanks. I I mean, I just don't
 know how to make sense of this
     whole thing, you know?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.806
       It's not like him
     to run off like that.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.308
       Okay, Sweetie, so
I'm going to head to the store.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.910
      So do you want me to
       get you anything?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.979
              Oh.

23:02.614 --> 23:04.248
              Hey.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.718
 What are you guys, uh- Jacob?

23:07.720 --> 23:10.221
     They just stopped by.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.393
              Oh.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.595
      Where have you been?

23:18.630 --> 23:22.900
       You think you can
hold off on going to the store?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.302
     So you're looking into
 Mason's disappearance, right?

23:25.304 --> 23:28.672
     Yeah. The others too.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.808
        If you guys got
 rid of Lilith and she was the
            witch--

23:30.810 --> 23:33.277
       Hansel thinks that
       there are others.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.646
        No, I know that
       there are others.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.982
   Hundreds. Maybe thousands.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.283
   Spread all over the place.

23:39.285 --> 23:43.954
      Yeah, but...witches?
   Like with powers and shit?

23:43.956 --> 23:47.658
It varies. Not all of them have
            powers.

23:47.660 --> 23:53.831
  I'm not even sure if Lilith
     was human or carrying
 something else, supernatural.

23:53.833 --> 23:57.368
 Some channel energies that are
 so powerful that it overcomes
             them.

23:57.370 --> 24:01.772
 Or they get greedy but others,
they intentionally choose a dark
              path

24:01.774 --> 24:08.345
   and basically become skin
 suits for demons and the like.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.917
   Look, just trust me. Okay?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.685
 I've seen things. Seen things
that would turn your shit white.

24:14.687 --> 24:20.024
    Okay, so, maybe it's not
   a good idea to go looking
      after these things.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.026
   No, not particularly. No.

24:22.028 --> 24:25.062
  So you think another one of
  these things came into town,

24:25.064 --> 24:26.964
   took Mason and the others?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.868
      I got a pretty good
      idea about it, yeah.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.937
  Unless Mason's lost a ton of
 weight in the last year I know

24:32.939 --> 24:38.075
  for a fact that these types
 specifically target big boys.

24:38.077 --> 24:41.278
      Fine. Let's go. I'm
           with you.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.746
            With me?

24:42.748 --> 24:44.114
         Yeah, me too.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.382
Hold on a second.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.085
        No, you hold on.
        It's my brother.

24:48.087 --> 24:51.255
 If you're going to go looking
for him then I'm going with you.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.824
          And so am I.
           - Why you?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.093
    Because I want to help.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.262
Because Mason was my friend too.

24:58.264 --> 25:01.265
    No, it's not happening.

25:01.267 --> 25:05.302
   If shit goes down we could
            all die.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.305
      Oh come on, Hansel.
I think we should let them come.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.040
     We could use the help.

25:10.042 --> 25:14.845
Hansel, you can't keep me away.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.148
     So where do we start?

25:23.989 --> 25:27.124
  This is where it all began.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.859
How'd this place blow up again?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.227
Gas leak.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.863
    We burned Lilith alive.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.865
  What? You burned her alive?

25:34.867 --> 25:39.036
      Fuck yeah. Taste of
    her own medicine, right?

25:39.038 --> 25:44.808
     Well I'd say from the
    looks of things no one's
   been here in a long time.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.211
    But underneath maybe...

25:47.213 --> 25:49.880
   Wouldn't all of that would
have collapsed in the explosion?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.081
 Yeah, except for the fact that
       I've seen a witch

25:51.083 --> 25:53.517
    burrow under the ground
      like a damn gopher.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.219
            No shit?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.287
            No shit.

25:56.289 --> 26:00.257
 So I'm thinking we're dealing
  with two possible scenarios.

26:00.259 --> 26:05.129
  One, Lilith is somehow still
alive, which I'd never rule out.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.964
  Or two, we're dealing with a
  replacement witch, who maybe

26:06.966 --> 26:09.867
      wants to stake claim
   on Lilith's old territory.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.269
So what are you leaning towards?

26:12.271 --> 26:15.539
           New witch.

26:17.276 --> 26:21.545
       You guys, is there
        a storm coming?

26:21.547 --> 26:24.582
Get down!

26:28.521 --> 26:31.388
    Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

26:36.227 --> 26:38.095
           Stay down!

26:40.499 --> 26:41.999
       What's happening?!

26:48.073 --> 26:49.039
     Did you see anything?

26:49.041 --> 26:49.940
             Yeah.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.075
 There's movement in the trees.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.177
       It's just a shape.
       I can't see much--

26:56.182 --> 26:57.348
           Stay here.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.550
   What? Where are you going?

27:02.355 --> 27:06.023
            Come on.
            Come on.

27:12.897 --> 27:17.001
        - You two okay?
         - Yeah, fine.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.336
          Who is that?

27:20.438 --> 27:22.139
        It's Mrs. Klima.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.274
  My old kindergarten teacher.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.110
        Was she a witch?

27:26.112 --> 27:27.444
          I doubt it.

27:27.446 --> 27:33.117
       Jesus, Mrs. Klima?
 Why would she want to kill us?

27:35.021 --> 27:38.956
       She was compelled
   to. This is a coven sigil.

27:38.958 --> 27:39.990
      I've seen it before.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.192
        It's being used
       for mind control.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.229
Where's Gretel?

27:49.234 --> 27:51.168
This can't be her.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.171
     What the hell is this?
      Who are you people?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.507
   What did you do to Lilith?

27:56.509 --> 27:57.608
            Lilith?

27:57.610 --> 27:59.443
  You killed her, bitch. Why?

27:59.445 --> 28:00.544
         No, I didn't!

28:00.546 --> 28:04.014
            You lie!

28:04.016 --> 28:05.549
I swear. It wasn't me.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.552
    You have to believe me.

28:26.938 --> 28:30.574
     I taste killer on you.

28:30.576 --> 28:34.044
       No, it wasn't me.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.481
       It was Hansel. You
      have to believe me!

28:37.483 --> 28:38.916
  What a mewling little rara.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.351
He killed her and we were going
   to eat her and he escaped.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.287
      He burned her alive.
         He killed her!

28:43.289 --> 28:44.488
           She lies.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.957
      Kill them both then.
      Only way to be sure.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.659
             Wait!

28:48.661 --> 28:51.495
 You are right about one thing.

28:51.497 --> 28:56.600
You've spilt blood. I tasted it.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.936
        Let me show you.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.741
            Please.

29:23.495 --> 29:29.433
        It's untainted.
        And it's human.

29:42.481 --> 29:48.185
          Mmm...Mmm..

29:48.187 --> 29:51.155
 That's Lilith's exact recipe.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.524
Taught me everything she knows.

29:53.526 --> 29:56.293
       Are you aware that
your brother didn't stop Lilith?

29:56.295 --> 30:00.030
    That he hunts our kind?

30:00.032 --> 30:03.300
       Bring us his head.
        Then we'll talk.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.370
 What? You can't seriously be--

30:06.372 --> 30:08.772
I know a sister when I see one.

30:08.774 --> 30:11.408
    We'll give her a chance
       to prove herself.

30:11.410 --> 30:17.514
    But if you fail, we get
       to eat you alive.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.486
             Fine.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.769
Clever girl.

30:38.771 --> 30:41.104
 Only one way to get stronger.

30:41.106 --> 30:44.641
Eat the strong.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.719
     Are you sure, Grandma?

30:55.721 --> 31:00.691
       Okay, thanks. No,
    I'll call you back. Bye.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.759
  No one's been by the house.

31:02.761 --> 31:04.261
  This doesn't make any sense.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.829
She was right there with us. I-

31:05.831 --> 31:07.497
 Mrs. Kilma was a distraction.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.433
They wanted our eyes off Gretel.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.468
     Who would want Gretel?

31:11.470 --> 31:18.108
     Revenge for Lilith. I
       mean, she owns...
           the shop!

31:18.944 --> 31:20.744
   Dude! I'm not strapped in!

31:20.746 --> 31:23.280
      Hansel, the shop is
      the other direction.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.615
       I'm sorry but I'm
     taking you both home.

31:24.617 --> 31:27.150
   What?! Absolutely not! You
     can't go by yourself.

31:27.152 --> 31:28.018
       What are we just-

31:28.020 --> 31:30.354
  I'm not going to expose you!

31:30.356 --> 31:32.356
      It's too dangerous.
     I'm going at it alone.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.591
  Okay, please tell me you're
going to call the police first.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.460
            No cops.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.363
      Okay, Hansel, Gretel
      is going to be okay.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.566
      She is a lot tougher
      than we all realize.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.902
 And you're going to find her.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.603
             Yeah.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.940
      Look, I'll just get
    you guys home, alright?

31:52.176 --> 31:54.878
 Come on. Let's get some sleep.

31:54.880 --> 31:55.846
           Good luck.

31:55.848 --> 31:59.216
         Come on Willy.
          -Goodnight.

31:59.218 --> 32:02.152
  Wait, I hope you understand.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.254
      I don't want you to
           get hurt.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.722
       Either one of you.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.191
Thank you
     but Jacob's a big boy.

32:08.193 --> 32:11.662
  He can take care of himself
 and I don't do so bad either.
              So--

32:11.664 --> 32:16.533
 Yeah, I know. But look...Just-

32:16.535 --> 32:18.635
I want you to take this, okay?

32:18.637 --> 32:19.636
          What is it?

32:20.539 --> 32:22.673
 It's supposed to protect you.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.943
   Hansel, it's a little bag.

32:25.945 --> 32:29.913
   I appreciate it. I can see
   that you're just trying to
 take care of me but I'm fine.

32:29.915 --> 32:33.483
Okay?

32:35.186 --> 32:38.755
          Hey Hansel?
            - Yeah.

32:39.257 --> 32:43.393
  I have to ask you something.

32:43.395 --> 32:48.198
       Why didn't you ask
    me out on a second date?

32:48.200 --> 32:52.369
I don't know. I just
thought you thought I was a spaz
           and to be

32:52.371 --> 32:57.274
    honest, I felt like you
   didn't have that much fun.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.843
   Well you sure know how to
  show a girl a good time now.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.480
             Yeah.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.784
      And you are a spaz.
      Just for the record.

33:12.423 --> 33:16.360
    Wait. What do you mean?

33:16.362 --> 33:18.996
          Good night.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.784
            Oh shit!

33:40.786 --> 33:42.919
             Easy.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.423
       Come on, let's go.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.492
      I don't think Willy
   saw me go around the back.

33:51.963 --> 33:55.298
  I want to go on record that
    this is a terrible idea.

33:56.901 --> 34:00.170
             Jacob?

34:12.984 --> 34:15.385
     Jacob, are you awake?

34:58.030 --> 35:01.898
     Jacob, are you awake?

35:34.600 --> 35:37.667
What are you-

35:45.810 --> 35:49.312
      Ugh. Tastes rotten.

35:51.949 --> 35:57.921
 Great. Right. Thank you, Remy.

35:57.923 --> 36:01.992
   Remy Prendes swears he saw
Gretel in the Gingerbread House
          last night.

36:01.994 --> 36:07.497
 That's impossible. I mean, we
  cased that place at least a
          dozen times.

36:07.499 --> 36:12.169
      Jacob and I, we went
 everywhere. So there's no way.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.423
        What's up, man?

36:33.425 --> 36:35.058
         They got them.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.927
          Who got who?
           -Alright.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.532
         Jesus Christ!

36:42.534 --> 36:45.769
       Yeah. I mean, they
 snatched Gretel in the woods.

36:45.771 --> 36:50.507
  They must have grabbed Willy
 when we dropped her off. After
            we left.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.677
 No. No, I don't believe this.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.579
             Willy!

36:59.484 --> 37:02.619
Willy!

37:02.621 --> 37:04.521
              Hon?

37:04.956 --> 37:06.189
             Oh no.

37:06.191 --> 37:10.560
         No no. I can't
imagine they've gotten very far.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.962
 Wait a second.Those pictures.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.863
     Let me see them again.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.136
       Come on. Come on.
    I know they're in here.

37:20.138 --> 37:20.937
             Shoot.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.506
           Let's go.

37:30.114 --> 37:35.185
     I took this summer art
      class. I had to take
photos of graffiti around town.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.657
             There!

37:40.659 --> 37:41.758
      Yeah, what about it?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.827
             Look.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.063
     I know where this is.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.817
  You ever shot a gun before?

38:07.819 --> 38:09.986
          Not really.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.188
           Take this.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.356
             Uh...

38:13.358 --> 38:15.258
       Don't worry. Just
      swing it like a bat.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.761
        You'll be fine.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.831
  How many times have you done
  something like this before?

38:21.833 --> 38:24.234
      Alright, here's what
       we're going to do.

38:24.236 --> 38:25.535
       I'm going to take
   the lead. You back me up.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.571
       Swing at anything
  that's not me or the girls.

38:28.573 --> 38:32.008
 And Jacob? Try not to take my
head off with that thing, okay?

38:33.211 --> 38:35.745
Hansel, I don't think I'm ready
        to kill anybody.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.947
      Don't worry. You're
     not going to have to.

38:37.949 --> 38:42.018
  Just give me enough room to
   get a couple of shots off.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.890
  Let's go. The girls need us.

39:04.775 --> 39:10.046
      Your hero is coming
      for you, my damsel.

39:10.048 --> 39:16.786
  Must be nice to have a big,
   strong man coming to your
            rescue.

39:19.623 --> 39:22.792
Does it make you wet, I wonder?

39:26.764 --> 39:29.165
        Don't touch her.

39:33.170 --> 39:37.140
     It stresses the meat.
        Makes it tough.

39:37.142 --> 39:41.044
  Wrong. It makes it sweeter.

39:43.248 --> 39:48.184
      Come on. Tie me up.
     They'll be here soon.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.687
         With pleasure.

40:00.031 --> 40:03.299
 Jesus, they could be anywhere.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.902
      All looks the same.

40:05.904 --> 40:10.173
No, we're close. I can feel it.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.380
       Alright, this way.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.951
          Stay close.

40:38.903 --> 40:41.704
           Wait here.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.783
         Where'd it go?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.852
         I don't know.

41:07.364 --> 41:09.032
             Shit!

41:09.034 --> 41:11.201
             Quiet!

41:11.203 --> 41:12.469
Hansel!

41:12.471 --> 41:15.104
This way! Come one! She's here!

41:17.741 --> 41:19.776
Hansel, hurry!

41:19.778 --> 41:22.145
 It sounds like she's up ahead.

41:26.984 --> 41:27.917
             Whoa!

41:35.826 --> 41:38.428
Wait a second. I know this guy.

41:38.430 --> 41:42.298
  He's a panhandler. I've seen
    him outside of my work.

41:42.300 --> 41:47.570
    They're fucking with us.
    Using the homeless to do
       their dirty work.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.906
    Things could get messy.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.876
      Come on. Let's move.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.720
            Hansel!

42:20.305 --> 42:21.371
          You alright?

42:21.373 --> 42:22.238
          I think so.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.540
Alright, we got to keep moving.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.713
           Let's go.

42:38.056 --> 42:38.955
            Hansel!

42:38.957 --> 42:40.490
             Shit!

42:40.492 --> 42:43.059
        - Are you okay?
   - No! Get me out of here!

42:43.061 --> 42:45.428
      Wilamina! Wilamina!
       Wake up! Wake up!

42:45.430 --> 42:49.299
  She's fine. She's just been
     knocked out. Untie me!

42:49.301 --> 42:50.700
              Ahh!

42:52.436 --> 42:55.004
        Jacob, use this.

42:55.006 --> 42:56.873
            Thanks.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.310
 Are you ok? Huh? Are you hurt?
            You ok?

43:09.286 --> 43:11.220
             Great.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.388
           What now?

43:12.390 --> 43:14.757
          It's locked!

43:17.028 --> 43:19.963
   Cover your mouths! Quick!

43:23.902 --> 43:25.268
             Shit!

43:27.037 --> 43:31.307
    Wait. Hold on a second.

43:31.309 --> 43:33.610
        It's just steam.

43:33.612 --> 43:37.080
         No, it's fog.

43:43.854 --> 43:46.823
   Do you want me to eat you?

43:48.058 --> 43:51.027
   Stay close. Hug the walls.

43:52.029 --> 43:56.099
   I can't see shit in here.
    I don't want to cut you.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.448
         Show yourself!

44:12.450 --> 44:16.919
            Ooh, I'm
    going to eat you all up.

44:16.921 --> 44:20.023
        Especially those
    chocolate eyes of yours.

44:22.894 --> 44:26.329
        Face me, witch.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.734
Stay here.

44:31.736 --> 44:33.636
No! Where
         are you going?

44:33.638 --> 44:35.071
       I'm going to help.

44:35.073 --> 44:35.938
              How?

44:35.940 --> 44:40.309
  Stay here. Willy needs you.

45:07.504 --> 45:11.908
   Show yourself, you fucking
             witch.

45:21.085 --> 45:22.518
      Hansel, behind you!

45:24.556 --> 45:25.688
         Are you good?
             -Yeah.

45:25.690 --> 45:28.324
         Where's Willy?

45:41.506 --> 45:42.638
             Willy.

45:42.640 --> 45:47.376
         Hansel? Ow, my
     head. What's going on?

45:47.378 --> 45:50.079
        Where's Gretel?

45:52.349 --> 45:54.150
            Gretel!

45:54.152 --> 45:56.185
           I'm here.

45:56.187 --> 45:59.055
       Come on. Let's go.

46:10.234 --> 46:11.467
         Take me home.

46:11.469 --> 46:14.437
     What about Mason? And
    the other missing kids?

46:14.439 --> 46:17.373
    Whatever's left of them.

46:19.576 --> 46:21.310
             Sorry.

46:22.646 --> 46:25.114
       Look, we came here
       for the girls, ok?

46:25.116 --> 46:27.283
       And since neither
 one of you know who took you,

46:27.285 --> 46:29.252
       we don't know how
     many witches are left.

46:29.254 --> 46:30.787
       You said there was
        only one witch?

46:30.789 --> 46:33.156
        Yeah but I saw a
      sigil in the woods.

46:33.158 --> 46:35.291
     That same thing here.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.026
              Ok?

46:37.028 --> 46:38.361
    It's definitely a coven.

46:38.363 --> 46:41.230
  There was somebody else. She
    was talking to someone.

46:41.232 --> 46:42.331
  It could have been a woman.

46:42.333 --> 46:45.735
        I don't know. I
     was pretty out of it.

46:45.737 --> 46:48.037
 Well, we need to be prepared.

46:48.039 --> 46:49.806
    Let's get back to town.

47:09.227 --> 47:11.060
             Ouch!

47:16.835 --> 47:18.568
              Hey.

47:18.570 --> 47:21.170
     Let me get the keys to
     the bakery. I want to
    go work on the town map.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.505
    Try and figure this out.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.473
I thought you hated the bakery.

47:24.475 --> 47:27.844
  I do hate the bakery. I just
 want to go to some place where
      I can clear my head.

47:27.846 --> 47:30.413
         Are you okay?

47:30.415 --> 47:34.350
      Yeah, just a little
      shaken. That's all.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.252
       Gretel, I know we
     haven't spent a ton of
    time together recently,

47:36.254 --> 47:40.423
  but you can still tell me if
  there's something wrong. You
       know that, right?

47:40.425 --> 47:44.160
       Well, yeah. Sure.
        Why do you ask?

47:44.162 --> 47:46.796
      I don't know. I just
    got this feeling like...

47:46.798 --> 47:48.130
    Maybe you need to talk.

47:48.132 --> 47:51.234
      Wow! You're sounding
  like such a girl right now.

47:52.203 --> 47:54.470
        Well, listen...

47:54.472 --> 47:56.639
  If you change your mind. You
   know, you do want an ear,

47:56.641 --> 47:57.740
   just know that I got one.

47:57.742 --> 47:59.375
     In fact, I've got two.

47:59.377 --> 48:00.943
           Thank you.

48:00.945 --> 48:04.413
            Thanks.
     -Oh wait, don't forget
  to lock up after you leave.

48:04.415 --> 48:08.251
Yes ma'am.

48:19.162 --> 48:22.265
    What do you see, Hansel?

48:26.470 --> 48:28.437
         He can see me.

48:28.439 --> 48:30.273
That's impossible.

48:30.275 --> 48:33.776
   He isn't the dumb piece of
      meat he used to be.

49:00.837 --> 49:02.705
              YOU!

49:02.707 --> 49:04.440
   You betrayed us meat bag!

49:04.442 --> 49:06.242
         No, I didn't!

49:06.244 --> 49:10.479
     I'm going to tear your
    filthy little heart out
   and toss you to the rats.

49:10.481 --> 49:13.282
       And then I'm going
   to have some fun with you.

49:13.284 --> 49:15.284
No, listen to me! He got lucky.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.019
    I didn't think he would
    be able to kill her. It
        was an accident.

49:17.021 --> 49:21.357
    An accident?! You stupid
     girl. I could just rip
     you a part right now.

49:21.359 --> 49:24.794
  I could take you to Hansel.

49:25.762 --> 49:27.863
  We don't need you for that.

49:27.865 --> 49:29.665
  We could get him ourselves.

49:29.667 --> 49:34.270
       But I do. Please,
       don't abandon me.

49:36.707 --> 49:39.775
I can take you to him right now.

49:39.777 --> 49:42.411
        It will be easy.

49:44.582 --> 49:47.984
     Why do you smell dead?

49:47.986 --> 49:50.619
       Why do you think?

49:50.621 --> 49:53.155
         I'm like you.

50:03.533 --> 50:05.001
            Hansel.

50:05.003 --> 50:06.535
       I want you to meet
        one of friends.

50:06.537 --> 50:09.538
     She's also one of the
    part-timers here on the
           weekends.

50:09.540 --> 50:12.541
             Circe.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.877
       Nice to meet you.

50:14.879 --> 50:20.850
     Go away now, Gretel. I
     need to chat with your
    sexy brother in private.

50:20.852 --> 50:22.318
          Uh, Gretel-

50:22.320 --> 50:28.391
  -You and I need to have some
serious conversation, doll face.

50:30.427 --> 50:32.895
          About what?

50:37.434 --> 50:41.404
       You like my eyes?

50:41.406 --> 50:42.938
              Yes.

50:43.507 --> 50:46.409
     I'm pretty, aren't I?

50:46.411 --> 50:48.577
              Yes.

50:48.579 --> 50:51.947
       You wouldn't mind
   talking to me, would you?

50:51.949 --> 50:53.783
              No.

50:54.618 --> 50:58.487
  You've been a bad, bad boy.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.656
          Haven't you?

51:00.658 --> 51:03.559
            I have?

51:04.428 --> 51:07.630
         Yes, you have.

51:07.632 --> 51:10.399
     You want to know why?

51:10.401 --> 51:12.068
              Why?

51:12.070 --> 51:18.641
  Because you've been killing
my sisters, you naughty naughty
              boy.

51:18.942 --> 51:20.910
I'm sorry.

51:20.912 --> 51:26.082
    It's too late for that,
   sweetheart. But it's okay.

51:26.084 --> 51:27.550
             It is?

51:27.552 --> 51:31.554
        I want you to do
       something for me.

51:31.556 --> 51:33.422
           Anything.

51:33.424 --> 51:37.760
       I want you to cut
        yourself for me.

51:46.670 --> 51:49.538
             Where?

51:49.540 --> 51:51.974
          Surprise me.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.621
           Beautiful.

52:07.090 --> 52:09.558
   Does this make you happy?

52:11.027 --> 52:16.932
   Yes. You want to know what
  would really make me happy?

52:16.934 --> 52:18.868
            Tell me.

52:20.070 --> 52:25.741
 If you killed yourself. Would
    you do that, sweetheart?

52:25.743 --> 52:29.645
            Oh, yes.

52:29.647 --> 52:35.518
           Go ahead.
         Kill yourself.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.627
       Push it in, baby.

52:47.831 --> 52:48.998
             Kiki?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.734
          Not exactly.

52:51.736 --> 52:56.071
 Hansel! Kill her! She's doing
      this. She ate Mason!

53:07.584 --> 53:09.652
            Gretel?

53:18.428 --> 53:20.596
            Gretel?

53:20.598 --> 53:23.165
            Gretel?

53:23.167 --> 53:25.100
         What happened?

53:25.669 --> 53:29.104
     I'm so sorry, Hansel.

53:29.106 --> 53:33.509
  I don't know what happened.
  She must have hypnotized me
         or something.

53:33.511 --> 53:34.843
           It's okay.

53:36.179 --> 53:40.516
 Let's call Willy, Jacob, have
    them come meet us here.

53:40.518 --> 53:41.750
         Are you sure?

53:41.752 --> 53:45.621
    Yeah. Safety in numbers.

53:45.623 --> 53:47.189
             Okay.

53:47.191 --> 53:50.025
  What do we do with the body?

53:52.496 --> 53:55.631
      So we got them all?

53:56.499 --> 53:58.667
             Maybe.

54:00.937 --> 54:05.074
       What'd you do with
    her...you know...corpse?

54:05.076 --> 54:07.142
             Jacob!

54:08.578 --> 54:10.446
    You don't want to know.

54:10.448 --> 54:15.217
     Don't suppose you got
     her to tell you where
Mason was before you off'd her?

54:15.219 --> 54:20.155
      You don't think he's
      still alive anymore.

54:20.157 --> 54:25.127
We can still look for his body,
 right? I can't just sit here.

54:27.063 --> 54:30.399
      They ate him, Jacob.

54:31.868 --> 54:36.639
    They're gone. We're not
   going to find them because
      they've been eaten.

54:36.641 --> 54:42.011
    That's how these witches
 survive. They eat the young to
    prolong their own lives.

54:42.013 --> 54:44.680
       If that's what you
        can call living.

54:44.682 --> 54:46.715
     You know how they say
    if you see one roach in
      your house what you

54:46.717 --> 54:49.952
   don't see is the thousands
of others that are in the walls?

54:49.954 --> 54:56.525
    That's two witches in a
 single day. And I bet anything
     that this is not over.

54:56.993 --> 55:00.229
  What and after you find them
   you're just going to leave
             again?

55:00.231 --> 55:02.598
    Yeah, I kind of have to.

55:02.600 --> 55:06.568
     This kind of stuff is
     happening everywhere.

55:06.570 --> 55:12.007
    Maybe you can come with
     me? You know, get out
    of town. Just for a bit.

55:12.009 --> 55:18.080
    I can't, Hansel. I can't
      leave grandma or the
  bakery. I have a life here.

55:20.617 --> 55:22.918
     I'm going to go home.
        Are you coming?

55:22.920 --> 55:24.653
      No, I'm staying. We
        need a new plan.

55:29.192 --> 55:31.293
      I'll drive you home.

55:31.295 --> 55:32.594
         No, it's fine.

55:32.596 --> 55:36.732
      No. Look, none of us
   should be alone right now.

55:36.734 --> 55:39.468
           I want to.

55:42.772 --> 55:45.274
 I'm going to drop her off. I'm
   going to come right back.

55:45.276 --> 55:48.777
   You guys going to be okay?

56:02.659 --> 56:07.930
      Mmm. Wow, these are
         really fresh.

56:07.932 --> 56:11.533
The best ingredients always are.

56:13.136 --> 56:16.338
   Do you know what you need?

56:16.340 --> 56:17.673
            Whoa...

56:17.675 --> 56:23.112
   I think you need to treat
     yourself right, Jacob.

56:23.114 --> 56:24.246
             I do?

56:24.248 --> 56:26.014
             Mhmm.

56:26.016 --> 56:30.152
I think you need to do something
         for yourself.

56:30.154 --> 56:34.089
   Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

56:34.091 --> 56:38.026
    I think you need to make
          love to me.

56:38.028 --> 56:39.161
             I do?

56:39.163 --> 56:40.829
             Mhmm.

56:40.831 --> 56:48.904
      And then I think you
    need to pluck your eyes
      out for me, sweetie.

56:50.340 --> 56:53.809
Can you do that for me, sweetie?

56:53.811 --> 56:57.045
          No. I can't.

56:57.047 --> 57:02.818
      Sure you can. Don't
   be shy. I'll show you how.

57:02.820 --> 57:06.889
          No, I can't.

57:08.024 --> 57:10.092
            I'm gay.

57:15.064 --> 57:17.733
              Oh.

57:28.044 --> 57:30.913
  There are many bodies here.

57:30.915 --> 57:33.782
       Beneath our feet.

57:33.784 --> 57:37.820
       Lilith was...busy.

57:41.224 --> 57:44.226
      Is she one of them?

57:44.228 --> 57:50.966
      There's something...
         Chewed bones.
         Nothing more.

57:53.102 --> 57:55.270
         She was eaten.

57:55.272 --> 58:02.044
      No...yes...no. Wait,

58:02.046 --> 58:02.845
      there is something.

58:14.457 --> 58:18.827
          What is it?

58:18.829 --> 58:23.365
      Circe...She is gone.

58:25.468 --> 58:32.541
  I can't feel her life force.
        It was the girl.

58:44.287 --> 58:49.391
    So when you leave again
     where are you headed?

58:49.393 --> 58:54.863
     Umm...I'm not sure. I
       usually just scan
    newspapers for patterns.

58:54.865 --> 58:59.935
    You know, missing kids,
     mysterious deaths. You
     know, stuff like that.

58:59.937 --> 59:01.970
       Sounds exhausting.

59:01.972 --> 59:05.340
    It can be but somebody's
         got to do it.

59:05.342 --> 59:09.444
And that somebody has to be you?

59:10.847 --> 59:16.919
      So, do you ever get
    time off or do anything
     fun like date, relax?

59:19.055 --> 59:26.128
Honestly, I can't even remember
the last time I had fun or took
           time off.

59:27.063 --> 59:33.135
Yeah, if it's any
  consolation I don't really,
I don't date at all.

59:33.970 --> 59:39.308
 I think I was honestly waiting
    for you to call. Maybe.

59:41.978 --> 59:46.915
    I quit school. FYI. That
    was kind of a big deal.

59:46.917 --> 59:48.417
            -Really?

59:48.419 --> 59:50.852
             -Yeah.

59:50.854 --> 59:52.955
 Well, you know what they say.

59:52.957 --> 59:57.225
     Nothing worth doing is
       easy. Or whatever.

59:57.227 --> 01:00:03.298
  Wow, scholarly, Hansel. It's
good. No, my priorities changed
            is all.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.402
   You know, simple as that.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.742
Come on.

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:27.222
You know, when it is time for me
to leave you could come with me.

01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:29.324
             Where?

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.627
           Anywhere.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:34.997
        To hunt witches?

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.368
       I'm going to have
       to think about it.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.803
          Fair enough.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.909
         What is that?

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:50.379
        I don't know...

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:54.383
Jacob
    can see everything now.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.569
          Fuck! Shit!

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:18.306
    What did they do to him,
  Hansel?! What did they do?!

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.046
Thank God. Are you okay?

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:26.415
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:27.449
             Okay.

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:28.784
What the hell
           happened?

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:31.420
What?
  What are you talking about?

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:33.288
     Look, they got Jacob.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.590
What? I told him not to leave!

01:01:35.592 --> 01:01:38.193
  Look, Jacob, It's not over.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.996
He
   only left here 20 minutes
        ago. What the...

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.597
Hansel! What are you doing--

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:46.101
       Hold on. Hold on.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:48.136
         Oh shit. Fuck.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.604
     -We have to find him.
       -Gretel, I have to
         call you back.

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:53.008
Okay, listen. Just close up the
shop. Go home. Be with Grandma.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.609
 Don't leave until I get there.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.080
             Fuck.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:03.485
  Listen, Jacob, He told me in
   confidence that he fucking
        kicked the shit

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:06.354
    out of Rudy Ray Moore on
       Candlewood Street.

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:08.423
      What does that have
 to do with anything, Hansel?!

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:11.326
     Just stay here, okay?
        Lock the doors.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:14.262
No, screw that! I'm not staying
 here. I want to come with you.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.064
    Okay, come on. Let's go.

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:28.910
Oh God, please let me be wrong.

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.614
           Oh my God!

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:35.283
         Motherfuckers!

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:39.221
 There's another note. Hold on.
            Hold on.

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:41.256
           Oh my God.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.158
         No. No no no.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.729
 Echoes of the past. Come play
      cowboys and indians.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.265
    Why are they doing this?

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:54.736
      Because they're just
     fucking with us. Look,
     he might not be dead.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:56.004
             What?
   -We could still save him.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.273
   Where are we going to go?

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.442
            Chumash.

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:01.343
             What?

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.779
 With the huts, teepee village.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.515
        Where we used to
     play cowboys and ind--

01:03:06.517 --> 01:03:10.352
             Yeah.
            -Oh my--

01:03:41.652 --> 01:03:45.387
            Cthonia?

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.557
            Cthonia?

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:58.300
              You!

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.202
             Wait.

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.539
        I did as I said.

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:11.580
             Here.

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:20.155
 My brother is gone. Tell your
    mistress I'm one of you.

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:41.843
      Hansel, what are we
       even looking for?

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:44.613
 Well if I'm right Jacob could
  be anywhere near here, okay?

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:46.615
   Just keep your eyes open.

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:48.450
             Jacob!

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:55.590
  Do you think that he's even-

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:56.892
            Stop it.

01:04:56.894 --> 01:05:01.696
   Don't even go there. Okay?
    We're going to find him.

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:12.474
Jacob.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.680
            Hansel.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:24.552
             Fuck.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.855
   This is starting to get so
       fucking fucked up.

01:05:26.857 --> 01:05:28.590
            Oh God.

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:34.629
       I left my heart in
         San Francisco.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.766
        What the hell do
      these mean, Hansel?

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:54.783
       Thank you, sister.

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:07.896
        Come on Gretel,
       answer the phone.

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:09.965
         Still nothing?

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:12.867
   No. Something's not right.

01:06:13.937 --> 01:06:16.204
      Are you sure this is
        the right place?

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:17.706
 Yeah, Church of Saint Francis.

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.674
 It's the closest thing to San
  Francisco I could think of.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:22.444
        Keep trying her.

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.847
         Hansel, look.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.485
           Oh my God.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:31.353
           Oh no. No!

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:32.354
             Jacob!

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:47.869
      Once upon a time...
       dinner is served.

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:51.306
 Those motherfuckers. Come on!
           Let's go.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.750
      Where are we going?

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.985
 Checking the servant's of the
             trail.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:05.720
      What does that mean?

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:10.492
        It means it ends
        where it began.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:14.229
       Did you see that?

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:24.572
           Oh my God.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:30.345
      The bitch's brother!

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:31.880
 She will pay for lying to me!

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:34.015
     She said this was you!

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:38.353
You son of a bitch.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.665
     Stay here. Stay here.

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.982
  Is that the best you've got?

01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:10.785
    I've killed cheerleaders
       tougher than you!

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:22.529
        You are going to
    be a nice little treat.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:31.171
 You can't kill me that easily
   you little ko fi yan sako!

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:33.541
    Whatever you say, lady.

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:37.912
           Hey! Hey!

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.488
         -Are you okay?

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:47.956
    Hurry, we've got to go.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:48.923
         What do I do?

01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:51.259
      Go. We've got to go.

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:03.505
      Poor, little thing.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:07.075
         Does it hurt?

01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:08.009
             Good.

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.046
             Mmm..

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.834
            Grandma?

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.069
            Gretel!

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:37.505
 You betrayed us, little girl.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.805
  What are you talking about?

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.843
           Get away!

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:47.948
      Don't you lie to me.
     You're responsible for
     all of the lives lost.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.685
Don't you touch her!

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:53.354
            Gretel?

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:04.799
     That's why you've been
  killing us off to steal our
             gifts.

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.468
No, I was too late to save her.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.137
        Morai told me to
       drink her essence.

01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:13.107
    She would never say that
    and there is no way that
      this is accidental.

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:15.109
   I'm with you. I swear it.

01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:16.978
What are you two talking about?

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.014
   Gretel, what's happening?

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:23.685
 You expect me to believe that?

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.954
        It's the truth.

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:31.392
          Convince me.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:39.567
    If that's what it takes.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:49.043
   Oh Grandma. I'm so sorry.

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.946
       Run while you can.

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:56.918
    You love me, don't you?

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.054
     Very much, baby girl.

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:03.791
    You wouldn't want me to
  appear weak, now would you?

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:09.697
No, no my sweets. Of course not.

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:15.770
     I'll be your favorite,
       forever and ever.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:21.075
           Of course.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.085
- Gretel!

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.854
             Oh my-

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:33.688
              Oh.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:34.689
   What the fuck did you do?

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:36.824
Oh my God!

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.893
     Hansel, I can explain.

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:42.196
 Please fucking explain why you
tore off our grandmother's head!

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:47.035
       Well no, I guess I
    can't explain this away.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.307
            Hansel?

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:55.677
   Hansel, wake up! Wake up.

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:59.947
     He'll be fine. I need
       him later anyway.

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:02.884
    People are going to come
    looking for you and your
        brother, Gretel.

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:05.119
  Lots to answer for, I think.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:11.125
You've made a big mistake, girl.

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:15.630
      Taste me now, bitch.

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:22.570
        You've ascended.

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:24.872
        Get the picture?

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:28.009
     You planned this whole
  fucking thing so you could-

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:35.750
 That's right, sister. It's my
 coven now. What's left of it.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:41.823
        Do you concede?

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:47.195
          Ring please.

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.999
          That a girl.

01:12:55.938 --> 01:13:00.441
    Help me with my brother.
  We're going to the cemetery.

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:02.243
    What's at the cemetery?

01:13:02.245 --> 01:13:05.213
         An old friend.

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:30.171
    Is this the right place?

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:35.943
 Wait, is this a pet cemetery?

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:43.017
  I needed to find a place no
      one would expect to
         find...Lilith.

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:53.761
       Clemmie was buried
  just days after Lilith died.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.331
     Hansel, are you okay?

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.834
            Perfect.

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.736
            Gretel?

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:09.343
  Oh, you're awake. I'm glad.
   I wanted you to see this.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:18.119
             Willy!

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.923
Gretel, why are you doing this?

01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:28.095
This is bigger than friendships
   or family, little brother.

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.131
   So you're one of them now?

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:34.001
        No, I'm better.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:41.108
      And my first job...I
     have a debt to repay.

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:55.122
    I'm sorry I didn't come
       soon enough. But I
     wasn't strong enough.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:15:00.194
  Thanks to the lovely ladies
   who sacrificed themselves.

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.965
         I'm here now.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:26.821
  -Gretel? Whatever you think
            you are,

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:34.195
   you are not strong enough
  to survive this incantation.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:38.065
Hecate omnipotens, mihi, quaeso

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:41.369
 manu. Nunc anima mea in mediis

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:46.440
  huius placiti anima damnati!

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:55.349
         I am a queen!

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:09.830
            Lilith!

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:15.303
I should have known
 you'd come to pick the bones.

01:16:15.305 --> 01:16:21.809
  No! I owed you everything. I
  only came here for revenge!

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:24.245
 You came to take my territory.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:30.318
    You could never control
   your appetite. So greedy.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:34.388
            My dear.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.157
            Lilith.

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:41.862
 You're going to pay for this!

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:13.427
  Good girl. Now bring me the
  body. I need to feed if i'm
     to regain my strength.

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:18.199
I don't think so.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:25.039
       Wake up. We got to
   get the fuck out of here.

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:34.982
     What the fuck? Willy?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.219
     Willy's dead, darling.

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:41.022
       She was delicious.

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:58.539
           Oh Lilith.

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:16.023
  And you could never control
     your proteges, Lilith.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:16.991
     Please, your highness-

01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:19.126
            -Enough!

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.437
         I wanted that.

01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:32.106
        Oh tut tut tut.

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:35.543
     So hungry, little one.

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:43.484
 But I can see that you need a
 lesson in subservience before
     the head of the order.

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:45.486
  I serve no one, you old hag!

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:51.592
       Feisty little imp.
       Sticks and stones.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.398
           Now, now!

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:38.339
  You really are determined to
 try my patience, little thing!

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:53.487
       Gretel. It doesn't
     have to be like this.

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:54.722
       Get out of my way.

01:19:54.724 --> 01:19:58.325
     This isn't you. Lilith
      is still inside you.

01:19:58.327 --> 01:20:02.096
        I love you. I do
     not want to hurt you.

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:19.146
   There is no Lilith! There
     is only me, the queen!

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.315
        Where are you?!

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.523
       Can a queen bleed?

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:35.529
        Damn it, Gretel!
        Don't make me do
             this!

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:37.731
      I can see I'm going
   to have to take you down!

01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:01.282
   I'm done playing with you!

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:07.154
         This ends now.

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:36.283
              Ahh!

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.691
            Gretel.

01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:45.559
          You shot me.

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.897
       I should kill you.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.866
           I'm sorry.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:03.243
       You deserve to pay
     for what you've done.

01:23:03.245 --> 01:23:08.515
     Not by them. Come on.
