WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.929
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- LEE: What's you record

00:03.000 --> 00:05.801
for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

00:05.903 --> 00:08.242
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

00:08.336 --> 00:09.568
THOMPKINS: <i>My job is to make sure</i>

00:09.670 --> 00:11.036
<i>that the people of the Narrows are safe.</i>

00:11.102 --> 00:13.369
<i>I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.</i>

00:13.471 --> 00:15.038
GORDON: I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.673
Five banks were robbed last night.

00:16.775 --> 00:18.708
Why don't you try going
after the real criminals?

00:18.810 --> 00:20.076
<i>Making money off the backs of the poor.</i>

00:20.178 --> 00:21.811
GORDON: <i>Like Gotham Savings and Loan?</i>

00:21.913 --> 00:24.449
- You are a fool!
- GORDON: <i> Come out with your hands up!</i>

00:27.485 --> 00:29.552
- I expected you might come, Captain.
- There's two of them.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.187
<i>What if he's nuttier than the other one?</i>

00:31.289 --> 00:32.387
JEREMIAH: <i>I'm nothing like Jerome.</i>

00:32.490 --> 00:34.557
I'm gonna drive you mad.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.793
<i>But don't worry, all of Gotham
will be joining you.</i>

00:36.895 --> 00:38.261
- Hands up!
- Bombs away!

00:38.363 --> 00:40.897
JEROME: <i>I'm more than a man.
I'm an idea.</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.899
<i>And I will live on in the shadows</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:45.735
<i>within Gotham's discontent.</i> (cackling)

00:50.041 --> 00:51.908
JEROME: <i>Burn it down, brother.</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:53.476
(cackling)

00:54.546 --> 00:56.512
(thunder rumbling)

01:02.754 --> 01:04.687
JONGLEUR: Brothers and sisters,

01:04.789 --> 01:07.657
let's raise a glass
to our fallen leader.

01:07.759 --> 01:09.759
To Jerome!

01:09.861 --> 01:11.728
ALL: To Jerome!

01:11.830 --> 01:13.529
(gargles, spits)

01:15.734 --> 01:17.700
(vehicle approaching)

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:28.613 --> 01:32.148
This affair is invitation only.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.684
(bells jingling)

01:34.786 --> 01:36.586
(laughter)

01:36.688 --> 01:38.755
Well, that's all right.
You're welcome to stay.

01:39.169 --> 01:41.135
But you won't be leaving.

01:42.627 --> 01:46.396
(air horn blaring,
crowd gasping and muttering)

01:50.902 --> 01:52.502
- (air horn stops)
- MAN: Ow!

01:52.604 --> 01:55.424
JEROME (over megaphone):
Why so sad, bozos?

01:55.526 --> 01:58.374
Did you think they could
get rid of me so easily?

01:58.476 --> 02:02.545
Well, okay, so they did.

02:02.647 --> 02:05.493
I'm dead. But let's not
dwell on negatives.

02:05.579 --> 02:08.308
I have one last party to throw.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.644
- First on the to-do list:
- (laughter)

02:10.746 --> 02:12.946
dig me up.

02:13.048 --> 02:15.749
- Dig me up!
- (excited chatter)

02:15.851 --> 02:17.584
JONGLEUR: Come on, clowns!

02:17.686 --> 02:19.219
Dig him up!

02:19.311 --> 02:20.587
Get Jerome!

02:20.689 --> 02:23.957
We're gonna dig you up, Jerome!
You hear me?

02:24.059 --> 02:25.559
Come on out of there!

02:25.661 --> 02:27.327
Come on, dig, dig, dig!

02:46.207 --> 02:47.514
What are you gonna do?

02:47.616 --> 02:49.850
What can I do?

02:49.952 --> 02:53.520
The back door is just down
that hallway, right there.

02:53.622 --> 02:56.223
I'm not letting her go, Harvey.

02:56.325 --> 02:58.925
Why not? I'm the only one here,

02:59.027 --> 03:01.518
and I'm really good at
looking the other way, partner.

03:01.611 --> 03:02.596
Not this time.

03:02.698 --> 03:05.174
BULLOCK: She robbed a dirty bank.

03:05.275 --> 03:08.183
People get away with a lot
worse in Gotham every day.

03:08.245 --> 03:10.137
Doesn't make it right.

03:10.239 --> 03:13.707
We got away with worse. Both of us.

03:13.809 --> 03:15.542
Get out of here.

03:15.652 --> 03:17.635
- What?
- I don't need that crap

03:17.706 --> 03:19.679
thrown in my face right now.
Get out of here!

03:25.988 --> 03:27.654
(door opens)

03:33.061 --> 03:35.695
Well, you finally nabbed me, copper.

03:39.601 --> 03:42.102
(sighs) What the hell, Lee?

03:42.204 --> 03:44.371
I don't suppose
this is where anyone expected

03:44.473 --> 03:46.106
our story to end.

03:47.032 --> 03:48.923
So it's ending?

03:49.876 --> 03:52.079
Hard to imagine what's left.

03:54.616 --> 03:56.349
I want to help you.

03:56.451 --> 03:58.118
How?

03:58.220 --> 04:01.388
Give up Nygma, return the money,

04:01.583 --> 04:03.583
and ask the D.A.
for supervised probation.

04:03.650 --> 04:05.376
I'm not betraying my friend.

04:06.395 --> 04:08.195
They can call you The Doc.

04:08.297 --> 04:11.498
You can rob banks, fight
gangsters, but I know you.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.750
You're Lee Thompkins, and all this?
This is just a...

04:16.071 --> 04:17.803
way of helping people.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.940
I understand that.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.608
Who doesn't want to be Robin Hood?

04:21.709 --> 04:23.343
But you're still breaking the law.

04:23.445 --> 04:25.512
Jim, you wish you could do
what I'm doing.

04:25.614 --> 04:27.948
Helping people without the straitjacket

04:28.050 --> 04:30.617
of the law... as if the law
means anything in Gotham.

04:30.719 --> 04:32.162
If the law has lost its meaning,

04:32.221 --> 04:34.419
it's because people like you
are turning your back on it.

04:34.505 --> 04:36.185
I am fighting back.

04:36.294 --> 04:38.052
I don't deny anything I've done.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.261
You want to send me to Blackgate?

04:39.331 --> 04:41.339
- Go ahead.
- I don't want to send you to Blackgate!

04:41.410 --> 04:42.652
That's the last thing I want to do.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.826
Don't you know I wish I could
let you walk out that door,

04:44.896 --> 04:45.899
turn my head?

04:46.001 --> 04:47.367
What's holding you back?

04:48.224 --> 04:51.404
Maybe if you let me go,
you'd let yourself go, too.

04:57.022 --> 04:59.246
So many things I wish I could change.

05:01.216 --> 05:03.345
Things I've done.

05:05.173 --> 05:06.853
Jim?

05:06.955 --> 05:09.322
(knock on door)

05:13.729 --> 05:15.295
(door opens)

05:15.397 --> 05:17.623
Sorry to stick my face in your business.

05:17.686 --> 05:19.759
Something just came up.

05:19.850 --> 05:23.752
LUCIUS: I've already inspected
it for booby traps. It's clear.

05:23.831 --> 05:25.998
- Well, that's a relief.
- I've taken the liberty

05:26.071 --> 05:28.100
of setting up a monitor in your office.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.606
(static crackles,
somber organ music playing)

05:34.630 --> 05:37.036
_

05:37.693 --> 05:40.622
BULLOCK: You don't think he might still
be alive, do you?

05:40.731 --> 05:42.748
What were the autopsy results, Lucius?

05:42.850 --> 05:44.149
Dead when he came in.

05:44.251 --> 05:45.729
More dead when he was eviscerated

05:45.815 --> 05:47.286
and his brain was sliced up.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.754
Hello, Jimmy!

05:48.856 --> 05:50.622
If you're watching this,

05:50.725 --> 05:53.459
things must not have gone well for me.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.128
Hmm. Shucks. (chuckles)

05:56.230 --> 05:59.365
I can only pray I gave as good as I got

05:59.467 --> 06:02.067
and left ample carnage in my wake.

06:03.504 --> 06:05.738
But I don't want to fixate
on disappointments.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.142
Jimmy, I have one last
teensy request for you.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.946
I want you to throw me a wake

06:14.048 --> 06:17.149
at the GCPD.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.985
(distorted): Don't worry
about the guest list.

06:20.087 --> 06:23.222
I've already sent the invitations.

06:23.324 --> 06:24.790
(cackling)

06:24.892 --> 06:27.126
I don't like the sound of that.

06:27.228 --> 06:29.428
(air horn blaring,
crowd cheering in distance)

06:34.502 --> 06:36.468
(excited chatter)

06:37.756 --> 06:40.339
Is everybody ready?

06:40.441 --> 06:42.174
(crowd cheering)

06:44.451 --> 06:46.145
Lock down everything now.

06:46.247 --> 06:48.614
Everybody, listen up! Lock it down!

06:48.716 --> 06:50.416
Lock it down now!

06:50.518 --> 06:52.484
(excited clamoring)

06:55.256 --> 06:57.790
(horn honking)

07:01.095 --> 07:02.895
♪ ♪

07:10.771 --> 07:12.429
The Doc's taken care of us.

07:12.484 --> 07:14.453
It's time for us to take care of her!

07:14.523 --> 07:16.182
Let's go down there
and bust her out of jail.

07:16.277 --> 07:17.676
No one cares about
the fate of Lee Thompkins

07:17.778 --> 07:19.178
more than me. Is that understood?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.316
Which is exactly why I will not have you

07:21.402 --> 07:23.480
bumbling into the GCPD en masse.

07:23.597 --> 07:24.917
So we're gonna let her rot?

07:25.019 --> 07:28.687
Leave her in the sweaty palms
of Jim Gordon?

07:28.789 --> 07:31.356
I would sooner debate you all
on teleology versus deontology

07:31.459 --> 07:33.492
than leave her
with that overgrown Boy Scout.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.860
- Teleo... Huh? Geez.
- What?

07:34.962 --> 07:37.763
My point exactly.
Look, if I had it my way,

07:37.865 --> 07:39.298
Jim Gordon would be
off the field of play

07:39.400 --> 07:41.233
once and for all, but Lee insists

07:41.335 --> 07:43.547
that I employ only nonlethal means.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.404
So, I and my brilliant crack team

07:45.506 --> 07:48.187
will liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.

07:48.273 --> 07:51.043
You stay here. Team, we have everything?

07:51.145 --> 07:53.045
- Bicycle pump? Can opener?
- Right here.

07:53.147 --> 07:55.414
Primer cord? Pickle jar?

07:55.516 --> 07:56.715
Fishing rod?

07:56.817 --> 07:59.585
Fabulous.
Okay, you four, you're with me.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.687
You, go where Jim Gordon goes.

08:01.789 --> 08:04.306
He comes under some harm, assist him.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.454
I do not need Lee blaming me

08:05.525 --> 08:06.558
if he's killed under friendly fire

08:06.660 --> 08:08.227
while I go about my business. Okay?

08:08.329 --> 08:10.229
All right, team. Follow my plan,
and we'll be back here

08:10.331 --> 08:12.748
to finish counting this
in just a few hours.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.076
Keep it up.

08:14.146 --> 08:16.702
Breaking Lee out's
gonna be a piece of cake.

08:16.804 --> 08:17.970
(phone rings)

08:18.072 --> 08:19.404
Hello? Wayne Manor.

08:19.482 --> 08:20.639
GORDON: <i>Alfred, it's Gordon.</i>

08:20.717 --> 08:21.807
Where's Bruce?

08:21.878 --> 08:24.109
Well, he's meeting with Jeremiah
about the energy project.

08:24.218 --> 08:25.251
<i>Something amiss?</i>

08:25.346 --> 08:27.079
He's meeting with Jeremiah Valeska?

08:27.181 --> 08:28.914
Yes, that's right. Now you can tell me

08:29.016 --> 08:30.667
why you sound so concerned.

08:30.753 --> 08:33.214
Jerome's followers are rampaging
outside the station.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.597
Oh, I see.

08:34.690 --> 08:35.921
Are Master Bruce

08:36.023 --> 08:38.125
and Jeremiah in any danger?

08:38.211 --> 08:39.304
<b>It's hard to say.</b>

08:39.360 --> 08:40.759
But right now, Jeremiah's maze

08:40.861 --> 08:42.640
may actually be
the safest place for them.

08:42.719 --> 08:44.796
Right. I shall head there nonetheless.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.832
- Thank you very much.
- (loud thudding)

08:46.934 --> 08:49.301
(thudding continues)

08:49.403 --> 08:52.437
(crowd clamoring)

08:52.540 --> 08:54.473
(yelling)

08:58.512 --> 09:00.679
What's the plan?

09:00.901 --> 09:02.915
Open up the armory.

09:03.119 --> 09:05.457
Now you're talking. Guys!

09:11.290 --> 09:14.618
(wild cackling, rhythmic grunting)

09:17.298 --> 09:20.499
- (guns racking)
- BULLOCK: Jim, hey! Hey, Jim!

09:20.585 --> 09:22.219
You figure out where
we're gonna hit 'em yet?

09:22.281 --> 09:24.849
- We're not.
- Say what?

09:24.884 --> 09:26.417
You know how Jerome works.

09:26.452 --> 09:29.119
Dead or alive, he uses distractions.

09:29.155 --> 09:30.565
So what, we're gonna
just let 'em come in

09:30.596 --> 09:32.088
through the front door and party?

09:32.135 --> 09:34.024
This wake is just intended
to distract us

09:34.060 --> 09:35.593
while his followers hit the real target.

09:35.628 --> 09:36.670
Which is?

09:36.686 --> 09:38.152
Well, we're never gonna figure that out

09:38.188 --> 09:40.087
if we're inside fighting off
these maniacs, are we?

09:40.123 --> 09:42.323
Look, they come in
the front door, right?

09:42.358 --> 09:45.259
We fall back, get a few
shots off, make it look good.

09:45.295 --> 09:47.495
Meanwhile, the entire
precinct sneaks out

09:47.530 --> 09:49.265
this old service door
as quickly as possible.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.734
I can't believe you're gonna
run away from these asses.

09:51.789 --> 09:54.569
Once we're outside, we surround
the building, cordon it off.

09:54.604 --> 09:57.104
- And then we trap 'em all inside.
- Correct.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.573
They blow off some steam...

09:58.608 --> 10:00.942
We hit 'em with tear gas
and knock a few heads.

10:00.977 --> 10:02.877
Yeah. Course,
we still have to figure out

10:02.912 --> 10:04.212
what the real target is.

10:04.247 --> 10:05.646
Got a plan for that?

10:05.682 --> 10:10.117
I do. It's a little sketchy
right now, but... Come on.

10:10.153 --> 10:12.386
All right, listen up, people!

10:13.212 --> 10:15.122
Here's the plan.

10:15.158 --> 10:18.392
Jeremiah, I didn't think you could get

10:18.428 --> 10:20.194
the generator program
working so quickly.

10:20.797 --> 10:22.263
You ready for a demonstration?

10:24.334 --> 10:25.867
Okay.

10:25.909 --> 10:27.692
You hit that switch there,
and the facility

10:27.757 --> 10:30.057
will be disconnected
from the power grid.

10:32.976 --> 10:34.942
(electricity whirring down)

10:36.980 --> 10:40.281
(electricity whirring up)

10:43.653 --> 10:45.620
♪ ♪

10:59.269 --> 11:02.069
Ambient energy.

11:02.764 --> 11:05.162
No cables or wires of any kind.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.629
It's clean and stable.

11:07.844 --> 11:10.896
Harvested from microtremors
and air density shifts. It's...

11:11.114 --> 11:14.103
It's virtually without costs.

11:15.180 --> 11:16.590
And with the prototypes at Wayne Labs,

11:16.642 --> 11:19.157
we could power all of Gotham?

11:20.259 --> 11:23.024
You've kept this project a secret, yes?

11:23.777 --> 11:26.784
No one outside of Wayne
Industries knows it exists.

11:28.542 --> 11:31.174
It's the ones who are closest to you

11:31.567 --> 11:34.416
that you have to keep your eye on.

11:34.970 --> 11:37.705
I know better than anyone.

11:40.501 --> 11:43.101
Arkham Asylum sent me
Jerome's personal effects.

11:43.181 --> 11:44.245
And amongst them,

11:44.280 --> 11:46.080
I found his diary.

11:52.956 --> 11:55.890
It's a catalog of his
fantasies and goals.

11:55.925 --> 11:58.726
Every twisted vision he ever had.

12:04.534 --> 12:07.068
Maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time reading it.

12:07.232 --> 12:09.201
He was obsessed with
torturing and murdering

12:09.248 --> 12:11.412
me, James Gordon, and you.

12:11.466 --> 12:13.908
And if he had been just
the least bit sane,

12:13.943 --> 12:16.630
he would have destroyed us all.

12:16.846 --> 12:19.947
(breath trembles)
And Gotham would be in ruin.

12:24.223 --> 12:26.169
Your brother is dead, Jeremiah.

12:27.290 --> 12:31.092
It's time for you to come out of
this bunker and join the world.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.133
Yes.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.808
Yes, he's dead.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.132
(closes book)

12:39.769 --> 12:42.536
I still have trouble believing it.

12:42.572 --> 12:44.338
(phone vibrating)

12:44.374 --> 12:46.307
Who is that?

12:46.852 --> 12:48.909
It's just Alfred.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.307
- Yeah?
- ALFRED: <i>Oh, Master Bruce,</i>

12:52.386 --> 12:54.113
<i>I've got some rather disturbing news.</i>

12:54.464 --> 12:57.151
Jerome Valeska's acolytes
are kicking off again.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.824
Yes.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.326
<i>Thank you, Alfred.</i>

13:05.817 --> 13:07.544
I'm on my way.

13:10.266 --> 13:12.236
Lunch plans.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.190
That was a lie.

13:19.791 --> 13:22.476
You're lying to me, Bruce?

13:24.547 --> 13:26.981
You're right. I'm sorry.

13:29.085 --> 13:33.101
It seems some of Jerome's
followers are causing trouble.

13:33.489 --> 13:35.456
Oh, my God.

13:37.493 --> 13:39.393
I was right.

13:39.429 --> 13:40.928
No, Jeremiah...

13:40.963 --> 13:43.731
I was right. He's not dead.

13:43.766 --> 13:45.433
Bruce, he's not dead.

13:45.468 --> 13:47.068
He's alive, and he's coming after me!

13:50.106 --> 13:52.073
(glass shatters in distance)

14:03.586 --> 14:05.553
(door creaking)

(glass shattering)

14:13.729 --> 14:15.696
(gunshots)

14:18.408 --> 14:19.941
Jeremiah, easy.

14:20.003 --> 14:21.235
Easy.

14:21.270 --> 14:23.270
You're not thinking clearly.

14:23.306 --> 14:25.456
Come on, this isn't like you.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.510
Bruce.

14:29.946 --> 14:32.126
Bruce, I need to tell you something.

14:32.836 --> 14:34.420
After Jerome died,

14:34.485 --> 14:36.649
he left one last final trap for me.

14:40.123 --> 14:43.070
He sprayed me with his insanity gas.

14:44.639 --> 14:46.094
"Special mixture,

14:46.163 --> 14:48.093
just for you, brother," he said.

14:53.552 --> 14:55.698
I can't stop seeing him...

14:58.416 --> 15:01.385
...clawing his way out
of his grave, coming for me.

15:01.432 --> 15:03.310
And even though I know it's not real,

15:03.346 --> 15:06.080
it... feels real.

15:08.117 --> 15:10.084
And I can't control myself.

15:10.216 --> 15:11.819
What if...

15:12.497 --> 15:15.388
What if I could show you
he's dead and buried?

15:16.794 --> 15:18.359
How?

15:19.544 --> 15:22.366
We go there, to his grave.

15:22.404 --> 15:25.304
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Jeremiah, listen to me.

15:25.329 --> 15:27.484
Your brother took away your
greatest strength, your mind,

15:27.509 --> 15:29.218
and turned it into a trap.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.693
But if you can see the reality,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.341
you can be freed from that trap.

15:39.282 --> 15:41.845
You really think that would work?

15:43.298 --> 15:45.103
I do.

15:48.224 --> 15:50.457
Then I'll try.

15:52.128 --> 15:54.094
You're a good friend, Bruce.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.438
(clamoring, rhythmic grunting)

16:06.042 --> 16:08.685
We're getting you and
the other prisoners out of here.

16:08.755 --> 16:10.344
What were you trying
to tell me before, Jim?

16:10.379 --> 16:11.745
There's a van outside
waiting for transfer.

16:11.781 --> 16:14.348
- Don't ignore me.
- I just want to get you safe first.

16:14.383 --> 16:15.883
Come to the Narrows.

16:15.918 --> 16:17.225
- What?
- Where you can make

16:17.250 --> 16:18.786
a real difference in this city.

16:18.821 --> 16:21.589
You can make up your own
rules about how to do it.

16:21.624 --> 16:25.159
(crowd yelling louder)

16:28.030 --> 16:29.797
(excited clamoring)

16:33.302 --> 16:34.868
(cackling)

16:35.598 --> 16:37.868
GORDON: Alvarez, get them out of here.

16:37.974 --> 16:39.540
Go.

16:39.575 --> 16:41.175
(yelling)

16:41.210 --> 16:43.043
GORDON: Don't shoot.

16:43.079 --> 16:44.812
Hold your fire.

16:46.749 --> 16:48.482
(chain saw buzzing)

17:01.117 --> 17:03.063
There's too many of 'em! Fall back!

17:03.099 --> 17:05.464
- Fall back!
- (growls)

17:05.721 --> 17:07.484
- Fall back!
- That's him!

17:07.510 --> 17:09.268
He killed Jerome!

17:09.338 --> 17:11.271
Gordon!

17:13.276 --> 17:15.675
(clamoring continues)

17:18.486 --> 17:20.618
OFFICER: Stay together! Stay together!

17:22.549 --> 17:24.449
Let's go! Let's go!

17:26.355 --> 17:28.188
(growls)

17:31.327 --> 17:32.593
(chuckles)

17:32.621 --> 17:34.954
Well, look at us.

17:35.032 --> 17:38.689
We caught ourselves
Captain James Gordon.

17:39.602 --> 17:42.903
Assassin of Jerome Valeska.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.204
Hi, guys.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.307
Oh, don't try and get
chummy with us, Gordon.

17:46.342 --> 17:48.909
We're gonna carve you up.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.945
Yeah. No, I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.181
Hey, man, you like to dance?

17:54.216 --> 17:55.616
(electricity crackling, men shouting)

17:59.026 --> 18:01.155
Let's, you and me, talk outside.
What do you say?

18:06.065 --> 18:08.065
(cell phone vibrating and ringing)

18:18.078 --> 18:19.978
(line ringing)

18:20.080 --> 18:22.046
(thunder rumbling)

18:24.959 --> 18:26.918
- Still no answer.
- Then something's wrong.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.162
We should go.

18:28.216 --> 18:29.787
He was on his way to your office.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.904
He'll wait for us there.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.412
(brush crunching)

18:36.514 --> 18:38.678
What was that?

18:38.725 --> 18:41.014
(thunder rumbling)

18:42.404 --> 18:43.683
We're almost there.

18:44.274 --> 18:46.400
Just a quick look and we'll leave.

18:47.470 --> 18:49.437
Bruce.

18:50.473 --> 18:52.340
Bruce.

18:54.377 --> 18:56.510
I don't know if I can do this.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.195
Just a little further.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.087
(thunder rumbling)

19:12.528 --> 19:13.761
Oh, God, no.

19:14.472 --> 19:16.257
His followers must have dug him up.

19:16.366 --> 19:18.366
He's alive.

19:18.710 --> 19:21.402
- I knew it. I knew it.
- We have to get out of here.

19:22.471 --> 19:24.104
He's alive!

19:24.207 --> 19:27.608
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

19:34.017 --> 19:36.717
(gasping)

19:42.859 --> 19:44.191
(panting)

19:44.293 --> 19:46.193
(grunts)

19:46.295 --> 19:49.010
How much longer are these petty
aggressions going to continue?!

19:49.088 --> 19:50.931
There's nothing petty
about my aggression.

19:51.034 --> 19:53.300
So, am I to starve

19:53.403 --> 19:55.503
until I guess the source
of your resentment?

19:57.974 --> 20:00.941
You said, if I joined you,
we'd be back on top.

20:01.044 --> 20:03.349
Instead, we're grubbing for Jerome

20:03.428 --> 20:04.779
and we got played by Nygma.

20:04.881 --> 20:09.183
You said, if I joined you,
you'd find me a cure.

20:09.285 --> 20:11.482
And yet...

20:12.490 --> 20:14.055
I admit that...

20:14.157 --> 20:17.925
(chuckles) through no fault of my own,

20:18.841 --> 20:21.271
our advancement has not run apace.

20:21.349 --> 20:22.630
"Not run apace"?!

20:22.732 --> 20:25.066
We're squatting in Falcone's mansion!

20:25.168 --> 20:27.735
We're knocking over liquor
stores to pay for groceries!

20:27.837 --> 20:30.838
Meanwhile, everyone else
is carving up Sofia's territory.

20:30.940 --> 20:33.674
We are lying in wait,
building a nest egg,

20:33.776 --> 20:37.311
while less deliberate players
show us their cards.

20:39.282 --> 20:42.817
If you don't find me Hugo
Strange and get me cured,

20:42.919 --> 20:44.618
I am going to crush your windpipe

20:44.721 --> 20:46.520
- like a beer can.
- Shh!

20:46.622 --> 20:47.955
Did you just shush me?

20:48.057 --> 20:50.791
Shush! I sense an opportunity here.

I'll never... (screaming)

All right, look,
this is how it's gonna go.

21:49.617 --> 21:51.898
You're gonna start talking,

21:52.021 --> 21:54.531

It's too late, anyways.

They're already dead.

Who? Who's dead?

22:06.250 --> 22:10.915
Jeremiah and Bruce Wayne. (cackles)

22:14.177 --> 22:15.643
They're at Jeremiah's bunker.

22:43.039 --> 22:45.406
Oh, yes.

22:45.508 --> 22:49.186
Oh, this might be easier
than I expected. (laughs)

22:52.448 --> 22:55.449
The Riddler! We're saved!

22:55.551 --> 22:57.117
How did you get out?

22:57.220 --> 22:59.153
Uh, through the old service door.

23:01.657 --> 23:03.514
The old service door.

23:03.575 --> 23:06.122
- What do we do now?
- Now we improvise.

23:06.217 --> 23:07.461
They're gonna use tear gas in here soon.

23:07.563 --> 23:10.598
I have to get in first.
We need a costume shop. Quick!

23:15.295 --> 23:16.628
Penguin!

Jeremiah!

24:16.866 --> 24:19.214
We need to leave! It's not safe!

24:19.357 --> 24:20.923
JEREMIAH: You believe me now?

24:21.737 --> 24:23.437
Jerome's alive.

24:23.539 --> 24:27.241

24:55.938 --> 24:58.060

I could dream of.

24:58.483 --> 25:01.217
Because I believe in you, Jeremiah.

So, tell me again,

25:34.543 --> 25:36.987
Bruce...

25:37.213 --> 25:39.792
