WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:04.705
(rock intro plays)

00:04.772 --> 00:09.410
* Well, I've got a secret
that I cannot say *

00:09.477 --> 00:13.814
* Blame all the movement
to give it away *

00:13.881 --> 00:18.586
* You've got somethin'
that I understand *

00:18.652 --> 00:22.890
* Holdin' it tightly,
caught on demand *

00:22.956 --> 00:24.792
* Leap of faith

00:24.858 --> 00:27.228
* Do you doubt?

00:27.295 --> 00:30.931
* Cut you in,
I just cut you out... *

00:30.998 --> 00:32.933
MAN: Get on the ground,
all of you!

00:33.000 --> 00:34.335
Do not move!

00:34.402 --> 00:36.137
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!

00:36.204 --> 00:37.171
Get outta here!

00:37.238 --> 00:39.873
(explosions)

00:39.940 --> 00:41.209
Turn around! Turn around!

00:41.275 --> 00:43.377
* Don't tell anyone *

00:43.444 --> 00:47.648
* Whatever you do

00:47.715 --> 00:49.049
Watch out!

00:49.117 --> 00:50.151
(explosions)

00:50.218 --> 00:51.752
* Don't tell anyone *

00:51.819 --> 00:53.754
* Whatever you do...

00:53.821 --> 00:54.855
MAN 2:
Drop the bag!

00:54.922 --> 00:56.824
Get on the floor now!

00:56.890 --> 00:58.359
Hands above
your heads!

00:58.426 --> 01:00.761
* Don't tell anyone *

01:00.828 --> 01:02.996
* Whatever you do...

01:03.063 --> 01:04.598
Man, you ain't cops!
No.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.933
We're not cops.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.368
What the hell you doing?

01:07.435 --> 01:08.869
Protecting
the innocent.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.071
Punishing
the guilty.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.849
DAVID: Now this, I have
not seen before.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.983
Say, Nikki,

01:23.050 --> 01:24.652
your boys at LAPD

01:24.718 --> 01:26.420
couldn't handle
a little B&E?

01:26.487 --> 01:27.755
B&Es they can handle just fine.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.091
But they do need help tracking
down a group of vigilantes.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.593
DAVID:
Vigilantes--

01:32.660 --> 01:34.094
might explain the message
on the wall.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.196
Yeah, fifth incident

01:35.263 --> 01:36.230
in two months.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.765
Similar situations,

01:37.831 --> 01:39.300
same type of
victims.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.301
What, these mooks
are victims?

01:40.368 --> 01:43.137
Yeah, got five subjects--

01:43.204 --> 01:45.139
ages 16 to 19.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.841
White, Latino, black.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.109
No gang affiliations.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.578
They were found
with lock picks,

01:50.644 --> 01:53.447
crowbars,
cable cutters, and

01:53.514 --> 01:55.249
backpacks full of school
computer equipment.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.517
Wrapped up like
Christmas presents

01:56.584 --> 01:57.385
for the police.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.886
NIKKI: The vigilantes
ambushed them.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.521
High-powered lights.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.390
Improvised
flash-bangs.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.158
Plastic restraints.
-What about "Vanguard?"

02:04.225 --> 02:05.593
That come up on any
of the databases?

02:05.659 --> 02:06.494
Nada.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.495
So you don't have anything?

02:07.561 --> 02:09.563
No, just got this cell phone.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.898
Found it here
on the floor.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.833
Dropped by a vigilante,
robbers?

02:12.900 --> 02:13.834
Yeah, or a student.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.636
I mean, it could be anybody.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.838
If they can't
tell us anything,

02:17.905 --> 02:19.640
this might.

02:23.744 --> 02:29.049
Someone scraped out the
MIN and the ESN.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.884
Translation.
-The MIN's

02:30.951 --> 02:33.587
a phone number; the ESN's
the electronic serial number.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.955
So, this wasn't
dropped

02:35.022 --> 02:35.789
on the floor by a student.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.658
Well, getting rid of
the phone number is easy.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.894
Getting rid of the ESN
is supposed to be impossible.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.999
You guys know math?

02:46.066 --> 02:47.235
Well, you can add,

02:47.301 --> 02:48.269
right?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.570
Well, add up the cost
of the equipment

02:49.637 --> 02:51.239
you were trying to steal,

02:51.305 --> 02:52.940
and that's grand larceny.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.442
It's first offense.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.943
We won't do time.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.977
Oh, yeah?

02:57.044 --> 02:58.912
Who told you that?

03:00.914 --> 03:03.351
You know, I'm looking
at the two of you,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.919
and I just don't see
masterminds.

03:05.986 --> 03:09.457
But you knew where all the
computers were, and you knew how

03:09.523 --> 03:11.158
to get past
an alarm system.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.294
So, I'm thinking
you had some help.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.764
Keep your mouth shut.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.969
Maybe you and I should
have a talk alone.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.506
You know what'll happen.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.210
I don't know nothing.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.515
It's the third round
with these guys.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.783
Never figured the FBI

03:35.849 --> 03:37.217
couldn't get a bunch
of kids to talk.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.620
They're scared to death
of someone.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.455
Well, the lobby's filling up
with parents and lawyers.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.657
We're running
out of time.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.361
A "cold-boot attack?"

03:47.428 --> 03:49.363
Yeah, also known as
a "cold ghosting attack,"

03:49.430 --> 03:50.664
an "iceman attack."

03:50.731 --> 03:51.799
Normally, when I remove
the memory chip,

03:51.865 --> 03:53.901
all the data stored in it
will be lost

03:53.967 --> 03:54.668
instantly.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.805
But if I freeze
it first...

03:57.871 --> 03:59.973
the data remains readable,
for sometimes

04:00.040 --> 04:02.476
as long as several minutes.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.418
(whirring)

04:10.484 --> 04:11.419
You got it.
-Wow.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.620
That actually worked.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.654
Of course.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.955
Just match that
to a cell

04:15.022 --> 04:16.089
carrier's ESN and...

04:16.156 --> 04:19.293
We get the name and address,
and we go get 'em.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.231
Thank you.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.434
Take care.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.306
Put it down!

04:32.373 --> 04:33.307
Put it down now!

04:33.374 --> 04:34.942
What the hell is going on?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.009
Are you Bai Lan Zhou?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.010
What? No!
-Bai Lan?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.011
Where is he?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.813
He? You don't know what

04:39.880 --> 04:41.081
you're talking about.
-We know Bai Lan

04:41.148 --> 04:41.749
owns this phone.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.083
And it's registered
to this address.

04:43.150 --> 04:46.354
Hey, Grandma.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.624
The FBI has your phone.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.859
No,

04:51.925 --> 04:53.461
I got it.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.363
Bai Lan Zhou?

04:55.429 --> 04:56.697
And that's her phone.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.532
It never leaves her sight.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.800
Texting charges are
through the roof.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.702
Someone must have cloned
her number.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.203
Sorry, uh,
for the inconvenience.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.338
Inconvenience?

05:04.405 --> 05:05.373
If you need

05:05.439 --> 05:07.441
to file a complaint, just, uh...

05:15.549 --> 05:16.750
The truck's stolen.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.886
There was a crew unloading
electronics off of it.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.021
The driver said it was
a bunch of kids.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.792
It's one of these
vigilante kids.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.827
COLBY: Two shotgun slugs
to the chest.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.062
Someone decided
to fight back.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.064
Check this out.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.003
Looks like we got
ourselves a feud.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.080
DAVID: Facial recognition
software identified the dead guy

05:47.147 --> 05:48.081
as Peter Hathaway.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.350
22, Grad student
at Mission Hills College.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.687
Thesis candidate
in systems engineering.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.589
Talked to the parents,
said they never heard

05:55.656 --> 05:57.324
of "Vanguard"
or vigilante activity.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.592
We need to find the rest
of these guys

05:58.659 --> 05:59.760
before they get
themselves killed.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.562
All right, friends, students,
teachers--

06:01.629 --> 06:03.096
and who is running the crew?

06:03.163 --> 06:04.131
Where are they
based?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.466
And how did this war start?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.300
Hey, can I show you
something?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.469
Yeah.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.270
The kids we arrested
at the school robbery--

06:10.337 --> 06:12.339
they all live in the same
general neighborhood.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.874
Atwater Village,

06:13.941 --> 06:15.443
just over the
5 Freeway,

06:15.509 --> 06:16.477
aka Toonerville.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.512
Aka what?
It's LAPD

06:18.579 --> 06:19.947
nickname, because of this guy--

06:20.013 --> 06:21.915
Vic Tooner.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.984
Suspected in dozens of crimes,
including murder.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.154
LAPD hasn't been able
to get anything on him.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.989
Witnesses, informants--
they all turn up dead.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.592
This guy's got an entire
neighborhood terrified.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.661
Now, he runs his crew
military-style,

06:33.727 --> 06:34.895
you know, organized.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.797
Posts sentries
to watch out for cops

06:36.864 --> 06:37.965
24-7.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.200
He's smart, but he's also crazy.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.368
He once murdered
one of his own

06:41.435 --> 06:43.604
lieutenants just for driving
the same kind of car he drives.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.473
And he's got the kids
working for him.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.574
Yeah, he uses kids

06:46.640 --> 06:47.908
because he knows
if they get caught,

06:47.975 --> 06:49.510
they'll be back on the
street in a few weeks.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.611
It's like old Fagin.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.613
Yeah, explains
the murdered vigilante.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.615
Tooner wouldn't tolerate anyone

06:54.682 --> 06:56.817
messing
with his operation.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.754
Cell phones can be cloned
using a DDI--

07:00.821 --> 07:02.623
a Digital Data Interpreter.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.592
Yeah, cellular thieves sit
by busy roads

07:04.658 --> 07:07.060
and pick up radio wave
transmissions.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.729
So, serial numbers,

07:08.796 --> 07:10.598
and phone numbers
of people passing by

07:10.664 --> 07:12.432
are captured and recorded.
-Great.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.467
Now you tell me.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.369
Can they monitor me if all
I'm doing is playing Tetris?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.605
Can we trace
these DDI devices?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.106
Unfortunately,
they don't

07:19.172 --> 07:20.774
emit enough of a signal.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.009
All ra dead end.is is

07:22.075 --> 07:22.976
Actually, maybe not.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.411
Can I see this?

07:24.478 --> 07:27.715
Yeah, you know, Vanguard has
advanced engineering skills.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.082
So maybe they're
getting access

07:29.149 --> 07:31.785
to the robbery crews'
communications...

07:31.852 --> 07:34.488
And if we figure out how,
maybe it'll give the FBI a lead

07:34.555 --> 07:35.589
on where the next robbery
will happen.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.957
Okay, how do you go
about doing that?

07:37.024 --> 07:39.527
That's a... a difficult problem.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.495
Three words:

07:41.562 --> 07:43.664
Deep. Current. Sets.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.633
And the expert
on them

07:45.699 --> 07:47.568
is guest lecturer at CalSci
at the moment.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.737
Marshall Penfield?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.271
He's your friend, right?

07:51.338 --> 07:52.472
Friend?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.007
Um, more like a "frienemy."

07:54.074 --> 07:55.042
Oh, yeah.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.443
That's that guy
you're always having

07:56.510 --> 07:57.545
those math fights with.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.679
The guy who calls Charles
"Eppsy."

07:58.746 --> 07:59.847
Well, I mean,
he did

07:59.913 --> 08:01.949
help out with that
home invasion case

08:02.015 --> 08:04.017
a couple years ago.
-Tangentially.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.653
Well, Charlie, we gotta get
this thing figured out

08:05.719 --> 08:07.054
before anybody else
gets killed, okay?

08:07.120 --> 08:07.888
So...
-I know.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.123
I know. Professor Fleinhardt,
a word?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.592
You know, actually,
I'm expecting to hear

08:11.659 --> 08:13.126
from a colleague
at CERN

08:13.193 --> 08:15.663
and you know how wounded
particle physicists get

08:15.729 --> 08:17.698
when-when their calls go
to voicemails.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.900
Anyway... ciao.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.505
Robert Santos.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.675
I want to talk to you about your
roommate, Peter Hathaway.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.710
Like I told the police,

08:29.777 --> 08:31.044
I didn't know him
very well.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.714
And though you shared a room
with him for nearly a year?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.716
We didn't hang out.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.718
What do you know
about him?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.486
He was lonely.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.520
You could see it.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.690
Sometimes he tried
to talk to me

08:42.756 --> 08:44.124
about classes,
something he was reading.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.094
But, you know, I'm so busy
with classes and tutoring.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.162
Did his behavior change
recently?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.430
Well, he used to be
in every night,

08:50.497 --> 08:52.900
but starting about three months
ago, he went out a lot.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.702
And did he indicate
where?

08:54.768 --> 08:56.670
And maybe mention a
group called Vanguard?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.005
No, never said a word.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.609
And I never asked
where he was going, so...

09:01.675 --> 09:03.110
What? What is it?

09:03.176 --> 09:05.779
I don't know. Maybe if I'd tried
to talk to him a little,

09:05.846 --> 09:07.848
invited him to hang out
with me and my friends--

09:07.915 --> 09:09.282
he wouldn't have
gotten mixed up

09:09.349 --> 09:11.619
in whatever
he was doing...

09:11.685 --> 09:13.654
when he died.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.756
Look, I gotta go.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.090
Peter's parents
are coming today.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.827
And I have no idea
what I'm going to tell them.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.866
From set theory's inception,

09:25.933 --> 09:27.768
some have argued
that it's a game

09:27.835 --> 09:29.803
that includes elements
of fantasy.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.138
Wittgenstein questioned

09:31.204 --> 09:34.441
how Zermelo Fraenkel set theory
handled infinities.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.678
Errett Bishop dismissed it
as "God's mathematics,

09:37.745 --> 09:41.481
which we should be left
for God to do."

09:41.548 --> 09:43.651
Next week's
discussion

09:43.717 --> 09:46.486
will be on the spectral theory

09:46.553 --> 09:49.489
of non-Hermitian
random matrices, okay?

09:49.556 --> 09:50.791
You're welcome.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.325
I'll see you next week.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.661
You math geniuses.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.896
Where's the glasses?

09:55.963 --> 09:57.998
Where's the hair?

09:58.065 --> 10:02.002
You know, these CalSci students
really can appreciate

10:02.069 --> 10:04.171
an incisive discussion
from a guest lecturer.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.674
How can they resist your charms?
-Yes.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.775
It is impossible,
isn't it?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.910
Speaking of which,
how is Amita?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.378
Are you two still dating?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.213
Yeah.
Really?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.249
Well, good for you, Eppsy.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.851
Marshall.
Yes?

10:17.918 --> 10:20.387
I'm going to ask you something,
-Okay.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.722
and if it's at all possible

10:21.789 --> 10:23.791
you can manage not to launch

10:23.857 --> 10:25.826
into your smirky world of glee,

10:25.893 --> 10:27.427
it'd be
much appreciated.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.862
Moi?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.799
I've been working on a case,
you know, for the FBI,

10:31.865 --> 10:36.436
and, uh, it might benefit
from your work

10:36.503 --> 10:39.239
in deep current set theory.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.374
So Charlie Eppes is
asking for my help...

10:41.441 --> 10:43.010
a second time.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.478
What, too gleeful?

10:45.545 --> 10:48.716
Sure. Be fun.

10:56.824 --> 11:01.061
Yeah, I can't
sleep either.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.230
I've got this
ratio-of-green-space problem

11:03.296 --> 11:06.433
for CalSci landscaping
I can't get out of my head.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.136
What is this? Non-FBI math?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.704
Not for long.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.039
"Professor Marshall
Penfield?"

11:12.105 --> 11:14.307
He's working on a case with you?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.745
Hey, so, this Saturday,
you want to have

11:17.811 --> 11:21.481
Amita and Don and Robin
over for brunch?

11:21.548 --> 11:22.649
Better make it dinner.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.285
I got golf and Don's
going to temple.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.388
Since when does Don go
to temple?

11:28.455 --> 11:32.025
I don't know.
A few weeks ago, I guess.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.330
COLBY:
So, LAPD responded to an alarm

11:37.397 --> 11:39.900
at an auto sound shop
about five weeks ago.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.502
Found three teenagers in
restraints, like at the school.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.605
Back then, they didn't know
they had an ongoing problem.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.542
So maybe something
got overlooked?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.444
Good thinking, Granger.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.813
They did miss something.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.315
What are you showing me,
the gang signs?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.617
I spent a year on LAPD
gang task force.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.086
I never seen nothing like that.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.354
That mean anything
to you?

12:01.421 --> 12:04.624
Uh, not immediately,
but there might be a subset

12:04.691 --> 12:06.259
within the superset.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.129
And for those of us
who don't speak math?

12:09.196 --> 12:10.430
I'm talking about set theory.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.665
Let say this circle represents

12:12.732 --> 12:14.167
objects visible
in the night sky.

12:14.234 --> 12:18.671
And this circle represents
objects that generate light.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.074
Where they overlap is a subset.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.177
Objects visible in the night sky
that generate light,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.345
like a star.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.849
How do you not have
your own show on PBS?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.550
The big question
in this case is, obviously,

12:30.617 --> 12:34.421
how do the vigilantes know where
the robbery crews will strike?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.689
And that's where Marshall's
deep current theory comes in.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.758
It looks for undetected sets.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.727
Think of patterns in crowds.

12:40.794 --> 12:44.764
Crowds move in general patterns,
but relatively minor events

12:44.832 --> 12:46.699
in specific areas can change

12:46.766 --> 12:48.335
the overall patterns
for everyone,

12:48.401 --> 12:51.805
even if most never see
what created the change.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.540
This approach allows us
to deduce information

12:53.606 --> 12:55.508
about the hidden nodes

12:55.575 --> 12:56.643
from the anomalies

12:56.709 --> 12:57.811
in the observed behavior

12:57.878 --> 12:59.512
of the visible network.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.183
Is that an accurate assessment,
Marshall?

13:03.250 --> 13:06.920
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off

13:06.987 --> 13:08.588
during your riveting monologue.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.057
I was stating the problem.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.392
Yeah, your approach
to the problem.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.193
Using your method.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.527
Being as though
it's my method,

13:14.594 --> 13:17.264
shouldn't I be the one
leading this inquiry?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.798
Well, this isn't a seminar,
Marshall.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.500
It's a criminal
investigation.

13:20.567 --> 13:25.973
So, uh... so then you have,
uh, handcuffs? Hm?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.741
Oh, yeah.
That'll get you there.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.477
I like the sound of that.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.579
Well, don't.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.148
Okay. Where'd you find this?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.985
At a business where the
vigilantes caught some thieves.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.320
It's a computer code.

13:41.922 --> 13:46.759
Why would anyone use a few
random computer code symbols?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.596
Unless it isn't random.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.663
Yeah. What about that?

13:50.730 --> 13:53.433
It would take pages of code
to say anything meaningful.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.135
What if it's not a computer
code, but a cipher code?

13:55.202 --> 13:56.904
It could take months
to figure out.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.238
No, they painted it
on a wall.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.440
I doubt they made it
hard to crack.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.543
Well, maybe it's a simple
Vigenere cipher.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.046
Well, then match the first
13 letters of the alphabet

14:06.113 --> 14:07.514
to those 13 code symbols.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.517
And what if the keyword
is "vanguard"?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.252
(computer blipping)

14:12.319 --> 14:13.921
(beeping)

14:18.158 --> 14:19.326
Is that a Web site?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.593
I don't know. Let's find out.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.332
Vanguard's Web site.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.203
Those are robberies
the vigilantes stopped.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.571
They even have the exact times
that each robbery

14:31.638 --> 14:33.941
was supposed to happen.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.076
And look at the last one.

14:36.143 --> 14:39.679
Appliance warehouse downtown.
And the date?

14:39.746 --> 14:41.381
That's today.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.883
(beep)

14:43.951 --> 14:45.785
"Vic Tooner."
Who's that?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.687
That... is trouble.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.056
Well, he doesn't look friendly.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.733
Daytime robbery.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.004
Tooner is looking to flush out
Vanguard where he can see 'em.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.876
They're taking the stuff.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.212
Yeah, I'm watching.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.049
COLBY:
It's just the robbers.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.018
There's no sign of Tooner.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.954
Vanguard isn't
showing either.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.893
Ken, you got anything?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.162
AGENT:
Negative. All zones are clear.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.465
COLBY:
Done. The crew's moving out.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.669
We got to move in.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.341
All right. Let's go.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.476
All units, move in. Take 'em.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.846
(tires screeching,
engines roaring)

15:46.913 --> 15:48.948
(sirens whoop,
tires screech)

15:49.016 --> 15:52.085
(indistinct shouting)

15:55.255 --> 15:56.356
FEMALE OFFICER:
Now! Now! Now!

15:56.423 --> 15:59.993
(officers shouting,
police radios crackling)

16:01.528 --> 16:04.131
None of Tooner's kids looked
armed for a showdown.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.465
Let's check out
these people here.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.933
Let's check out
all these people here.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.068
You want
to look at the crowd,

16:08.135 --> 16:09.802
see if anyone's wearing
a Vanguard symbol?

16:09.869 --> 16:11.471
Yeah.
That we found.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.074
The east perimeter found him
on the rooftop with this,

16:14.141 --> 16:15.475
filming the robbery.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.245
They kill one of yours,
you show up with a camera?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.746
My mission was
to gather evidence,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.481
not to intervene.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.683
What mission? Who is a part
of this mission with you?

16:38.565 --> 16:42.869
I was there to record
the incident, nothing else.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.204
That against the law?

16:44.271 --> 16:45.638
Prior knowledge of a crime?

16:45.705 --> 16:47.274
Yeah, that's a problem.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.775
Who are you working with?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.543
We don't use names.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.978
We use code names.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.714
If we're captured, we can't
compromise the operation.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.016
You know him?

16:57.084 --> 16:59.752
We call him Bars.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.621
His code name.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.922
Bars?

17:02.989 --> 17:05.725
Yeah, you know,
like on a cell phone?

17:05.792 --> 17:07.560
He's a phreaker.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.229
A phone expert--

17:09.296 --> 17:11.564
could do stuff with cell phones.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.700
How do you know
which places to rob?

17:13.766 --> 17:17.170
There's a Web site,
or you get a phone call...

17:17.237 --> 17:19.539
or a guy comes to your house.

17:19.606 --> 17:23.110
That's how you get the word--
where to go, what to steal.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.913
And who gives the word?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.549
Nobody talks about that.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.218
You're gonna take
the full weight

17:31.284 --> 17:33.520
for stuff you didn't plan
or control.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.655
It's worth it
to do what's right.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.224
And what's that?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.459
Doing what needs to be done.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.061
What the cops
haven't been able to do.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.332
Do you know a guy named
Vic Tooner?

17:47.234 --> 17:48.768
Never heard of him.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.606
Not ever.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.744
Tooner seems to have a deep
supply of kids,

17:57.810 --> 17:59.312
all of them too scared to talk.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.348
The guy from Vanguard
was stonewalling us also,

18:01.414 --> 18:02.715
but he's not scared.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.083
So what's that about?

18:04.151 --> 18:06.486
Maybe someone
inspired him.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.521
He speaks like a covert op
on a mission.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.922
They both have
the same methods.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.524
Only one is pure damn evil

18:11.591 --> 18:14.194
and the other one's trying
to play hero.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.363
CHARLIE:
You're wrong.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.065
Its structure lacks originality
or integrity.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.300
It's a classic organization,

18:20.367 --> 18:22.935
based on tested
and proven elements.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.237
It's a chain.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
It's a chain with irregularities

18:25.672 --> 18:27.607
that come with maintaining
complex matrices.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.076
Oh, so you propose
that a single point mechanism

18:30.143 --> 18:31.944
provides superior output?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.580
Enough.

18:33.646 --> 18:37.016
Surely, two eminent
mathematicians can find ways

18:37.083 --> 18:39.085
to calmly discuss theory.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.420
We're not discussing theory.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.588
No, we're talking hamburgers.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.655
Pie 'n' Burger's
the best, man.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.391
There's no question about it.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.293
In-N-Out is far superior.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.528
I remember a day,
not long ago,

18:48.595 --> 18:51.731
when you were both undergrads,
working together

18:51.798 --> 18:53.533
on a topology problem.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.536
That's only because you assigned
us to work on it together.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.171
We preferred
working alone.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.439
Which is my point.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.675
Neither of you is gifted
at the art of collaboration,

19:02.742 --> 19:05.545
which is most crucial
in science.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.614
Who is this?
Is this one of our students?

19:07.680 --> 19:10.450
No. It's a grad student
at Harvey Mudd College.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.353
FBI arrested him in connection
with this vigilante group.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.821
No one else in his circle seems
connected

19:14.887 --> 19:16.756
to vigilante activities.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.192
But this student is defined
by the same deep current

19:19.259 --> 19:21.461
as the other vigilantes.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.029
So we should look
at the super sets

19:23.095 --> 19:24.364
as they define
this student.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.765
Like that the fact
that he is a student.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.267
Precisely.
When there is a finite number

19:27.334 --> 19:28.635
of grad students in the region.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.169
Even fewer with the computing

19:30.237 --> 19:32.038
and telecommunication skills
required.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.540
Yeah, they hide
the organization,

19:33.606 --> 19:35.542
so you need to refine the search
by eliminating people

19:35.608 --> 19:38.611
openly linked to identified
Vanguard members.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.581
So we work up an algorithm
that does that, and...

19:41.648 --> 19:44.016
And just set it loose
in grad school databases.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.718
LARRY:
Ah...

19:45.785 --> 19:48.187
the sweet sound
of collaboration.

19:48.255 --> 19:51.090
This will I.D. students
who fit the profile

19:51.157 --> 19:52.792
of Vanguard members.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.661
The results will be based
on probability,

19:54.727 --> 19:57.497
so you can't just arrest people
whose names pop up.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.131
I get it. You don't want us
making life miserable

19:59.198 --> 20:00.600
for innocent grad students.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.335
That's what professors are for.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.504
You guys work
with bright kids.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.374
Why do you think these Vanguard
guys would risk their lives

20:07.440 --> 20:09.108
going up against
a violent criminal?

20:09.175 --> 20:10.777
A hazard of being smart.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.044
You figure you can outthink
anybody.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.614
MARSHALL: You look at life
like a chess game.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.883
Make smart moves, you win.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.251
This isn't a game,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.920
or a classroom problem.

20:36.669 --> 20:40.773
Everybody knows our name,
but nobody's glad we came.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.576
I've never seen
a neighborhood this scared.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.382
Hey, these are for you.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.517
Thanks, little guy.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.851
Who sent them over?

20:53.986 --> 20:56.989
Heard you guys
were looking for me.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.561
NIKKI: He used to pull this
with LAPD.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.430
Walk up to officers
on the street,

21:03.496 --> 21:04.864
come in
for interviews.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.999
He knows we don't
have anything.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.168
I own a tattoo parlor.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.804
Legal, licensed business.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.807
What do you know
about robbery teams

21:14.874 --> 21:16.008
run out of your
neighborhood?

21:16.075 --> 21:18.645
Well, I hope the police
can do something about that.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.647
Well, somebody's trying
to do something about that.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.650
Well, I understand
why people do that.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.353
I'm a concerned citizen,
like anybody else.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.820
Oh, I know
how difficult

21:27.887 --> 21:29.989
it is to police
an urban area

21:30.056 --> 21:31.591
with a gang
subculture

21:31.658 --> 21:33.593
and a black market economy.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.695
You'd have
to spend years working

21:35.762 --> 21:37.730
to infiltrate
highly secretive groups

21:37.797 --> 21:40.433
that are paramilitary
in their operation.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.735
So, we got ourselves
a concerned citizen.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.505
I studied police sciences.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.707
I took classes
at City College.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.811
Hey, maybe I'll apply
to the academy.

21:51.878 --> 21:55.114
You know, I bet you I could ace
that obstacle course.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.716
(chuckling)

21:56.783 --> 21:58.351
DAVID:
What do you know

21:58.418 --> 22:00.019
about a group called Vanguard?

22:00.086 --> 22:01.754
Just what I hear on the street.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.189
DON:
And what's that?

22:03.255 --> 22:04.957
Smart guys.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.258
In over their heads.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.094
DAVID:
Over their heads?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.195
How so?

22:09.261 --> 22:11.831
Oh, you know--
emotionally.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.900
Living
in a dream world.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.004
What do you think's going
to happen to them?

22:18.070 --> 22:20.139
What happens to anybody?

22:20.206 --> 22:22.141
Some will quit.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.010
Some will have accidents.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.912
Accidents?

22:25.978 --> 22:27.414
Accidents.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.949
Car accidents, whatever.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.052
Also, depression's
a problem

22:33.119 --> 22:34.053
for college kids.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.254
You, uh...

22:35.321 --> 22:38.725
you might find one of them
way in the back of a library,

22:38.791 --> 22:42.361
note pinned to his chest,
hanging from a rafter.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.866
What does it matter?

22:47.934 --> 22:50.002
One by one,
sooner or later,

22:50.069 --> 22:52.371
everybody dies.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.378
Where are you going?

22:59.446 --> 23:03.750
This is a noncustodial
interrogation.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.586
I can leave whenever I want.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.890
CHARLIE:
You ruined it.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.525
Look at it--
you flattened the tip,

23:12.592 --> 23:14.126
and now it's completely
out of ink.

23:14.193 --> 23:14.994
How was I
supposed to know

23:15.061 --> 23:16.929
that you like
to use scented markers

23:16.996 --> 23:18.465
and that your favorite flavor
is strawberry?

23:18.531 --> 23:19.966
Well, listen, you know,
the next time,

23:20.032 --> 23:21.400
do me a favor and just

23:21.468 --> 23:22.569
bring your own
markers, okay?

23:22.635 --> 23:23.803
Here's another thing.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.338
Your idea about the analysis
of Vanguard's

23:26.405 --> 23:27.774
previous attacks,
it totally ignores

23:27.840 --> 23:29.709
the cardinality
of the union of sets.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.110
You know,
it's funny,

23:31.177 --> 23:32.011
Marshall, it's my idea,

23:32.078 --> 23:33.880
so I think I know
how it's supposed to work.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.082
Oh, who is the expert
on deep current sets here?

23:36.148 --> 23:37.016
Huh? Me.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.351
Why does he always negate
my proposals?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.287
Why are you
so dismissive?

23:41.353 --> 23:43.590
Why are you so competitive?

23:43.656 --> 23:45.592
Boys, don't make me
pull the math car over.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.728
This isn't about math,
is it, Eppsy?

23:48.795 --> 23:49.929
Maybe it's about you
calling me Eppsy.

23:49.996 --> 23:50.930
AMITA: Anyway...

23:50.997 --> 23:51.698
(clears throat)

23:51.764 --> 23:53.900
I was thinking
that if someone at Vanguard

23:53.966 --> 23:55.835
is that familiar
with the computer source code,

23:55.902 --> 23:57.570
I should probably take
a closer look

23:57.637 --> 23:59.271
at the browser code
on the Web site.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.973
Yes, programmers
often use

24:01.040 --> 24:03.309
distinctive
object-oriented symbols,

24:03.375 --> 24:04.611
uh, statements,
method calls.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.745
AMITA:
Exactly.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.515
My comparative analysis
shows the Vanguard code

24:08.581 --> 24:09.882
is very similar
to a code

24:09.949 --> 24:11.551
found at the
intrauniversity

24:11.618 --> 24:12.719
astrophysics project.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.587
Note that success
results

24:14.654 --> 24:17.557
not from the Eppes method
nor from

24:17.624 --> 24:20.092
the Penfield approach, but
from the Ramanujan scan.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.994
All right, well, Amita,
can you find the name

24:22.061 --> 24:23.663
of the person who
wrote this code?

24:23.730 --> 24:25.164
'Cause that might be
the leader of Vanguard.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.633
(typing)

24:26.699 --> 24:28.901
CHARLIE:
Why do I let Marshall

24:28.968 --> 24:29.736
get to me?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.370
LARRY:
He's a rival.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.706
Look, everybody
has one, and frankly,

24:33.773 --> 24:36.676
who they are says a lot
about who you are.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.712
Yeah, what does Marshall
hating me say about me?

24:39.779 --> 24:40.713
He doesn't hate you.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.682
What is that word
that Amita uses?

24:42.749 --> 24:43.783
"Frienemy."
-There you go.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.585
Colleagues
as well as rivals.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.821
I think you just remind
each other of a time

24:48.888 --> 24:50.757
in your careers
when you were both

24:50.823 --> 24:53.159
less secure
in your reputations.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.627
What about you?

24:54.694 --> 24:56.395
Who sets you off?

24:56.462 --> 24:58.130
Al McNabb.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.532
Guy in my car club.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.733
He absolutely

25:00.800 --> 25:01.934
covets my Ford roadster,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.637
yet he always says the leather
is not restored

25:04.704 --> 25:07.439
to 1931 period standard,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.576
the color's all wrong.

25:09.642 --> 25:13.580
He is just one jealous bastard.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.014
You know who doesn't
have a rival?

25:15.081 --> 25:16.115
Don.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.216
Seriously,

25:17.283 --> 25:20.219
I've never heard him talk
about anyone like that.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.822
Well, Don questions
and challenges himself.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.391
He's like his own frienemy,
so to speak.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.995
You know, maybe that's why
he's going to temple.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.262
What is it

25:30.329 --> 25:31.330
that Rabbi Abraham Heschel said?

25:31.397 --> 25:34.066
"The primary task
of the philosophy of religion

25:34.133 --> 25:38.638
is to discover those questions
to which religion is an answer."

25:40.840 --> 25:42.775
Now, did my dad tell you that?

25:42.842 --> 25:44.711
About Don going to temple?

25:44.777 --> 25:47.113
No, Don did.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.848
He told you?

25:48.915 --> 25:51.017
He didn't tell me.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.391
What's up?

25:59.458 --> 26:00.827
Ah, nothing much.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.862
It's just something
Tooner said about, um,

26:02.929 --> 26:04.764
Vanguard members
having accidents,

26:04.831 --> 26:08.234
you know, a suicide
in a library.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.302
Maybe we should call
the local colleges.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.646
So, what did Nikki
say about Tooner?

26:19.712 --> 26:21.614
Smart, but crazy?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.221
Looks like the crazy part.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.268
DAVID:
Mason Spellman, 19.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.670
Physics major.

26:43.736 --> 26:44.771
M.E. thinks he was dead

26:44.837 --> 26:46.906
about ten hours
before his body was found.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.742
In the engineering library,
pretty much like Tooner said,

26:49.809 --> 26:51.277
in general terms.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.913
Robin is gonna definitely say
we need more than this.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.948
Especially since Spellman
had a problem with depression.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.918
No other fingerprints at the
crime scene except for his.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.687
Note's
in his own handwriting.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.355
So, we think we
know how Tooner's

27:03.422 --> 27:05.725
been able to locate
those vigilantes.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.727
The deep current set analysis
reveals

27:07.794 --> 27:09.028
that he's found some way

27:09.095 --> 27:10.997
to reverse engineer
their technology.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.766
Right, so we're gonna try
to duplicate Tooner's math.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.467
All right, that
sounds good.

27:15.534 --> 27:16.502
None of the dead kids

27:16.568 --> 27:18.370
have a connection to Tooner
that we can find,

27:18.437 --> 27:20.006
but I'm thinking
somebody in Vanguard,

27:20.072 --> 27:21.908
they must have crossed paths
with him somewhere.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.776
Right, hey, see if you
can find out any

27:23.843 --> 27:26.078
of those colleges he took
courses at, you know?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.849
Tooner audited courses
at Occidental

27:29.916 --> 27:31.884
and Whittier,
as well as City College.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.887
And while at City College,
LAPD had him

27:34.954 --> 27:37.023
as a person of interest
in the rape and murder

27:37.089 --> 27:40.159
of a student, Lori Sanchez.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.661
OLIVER: Never met her,
but I heard she died.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.130
How did you hear that?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.332
It was a topic of discussion.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.666
With who?

27:47.734 --> 27:49.035
I told you.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.536
I don't know names,

27:50.602 --> 27:53.973
but a lot of people care
when an innocent person dies.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.544
You really think
that this is all revenge

27:58.610 --> 27:59.912
for one murdered girl?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.513
Let's find out more about her.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.582
Hey.
-What's up, kid?

28:03.649 --> 28:04.917
On my way to school.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.986
Got to get through
that analysis for you.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.488
You and Marshall really
set each other off, huh?

28:09.555 --> 28:10.556
Yeah, I know.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.191
I know, we're,
uh, frienemies.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.292
Where's Dad?

28:13.359 --> 28:14.961
He's around.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.030
Hey, Don.
-Hey.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.733
So, you started going to temple?

28:21.901 --> 28:23.770
Dad tell you that?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.504
And Larry.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.406
There some reason
you didn't tell me?

28:27.473 --> 28:31.110
I don't know, you know,
it's just like that thing

28:31.177 --> 28:34.380
you're always saying about not
contaminating experiments.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.048
Yeah.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.920
Charlie, I don't know
where I'm going with any of it.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.189
I just... I can't get
into a scientific debate

28:43.255 --> 28:47.126
with you about whether
it's logical or not.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.796
Since when did you listen
to everything I say?

28:49.862 --> 28:51.597
Eh, you can be
pretty intimidating.

28:51.663 --> 28:52.598
To you?

28:52.664 --> 28:54.433
To everybody.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.839
Well, I-I think going to temple
is an interesting choice.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.874
I have nothing negative
to say about that.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.976
Okay, cool.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.878
At least it's not a monastery.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.349
All right, see you
at dinner, all right?

29:10.416 --> 29:11.818
Yeah.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.988
What, you were standing there
listening?

29:16.055 --> 29:18.657
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I heard every word, yeah.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.459
Okay, so let's have it.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.728
I think you did a good job
all these years

29:22.795 --> 29:24.296
hiding any sign
that he intimidates you.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.264
(chuckling)

29:25.331 --> 29:26.732
Well, that's
what I think.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.234
All right.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.504
So, the vigilante
who wrote the coding...

29:32.571 --> 29:35.107
he was involved in this
astrophysics project?

29:35.174 --> 29:36.142
Yes.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.243
Similar phrases
and styles.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.878
NIKKI:
Who do you think

29:38.945 --> 29:40.012
killed Lori Sanchez?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.480
That Vic Tooner creep.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.016
But the police said
there was no evidence.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.886
There was no mention in the
file about a boyfriend.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.220
She didn't have one.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.690
Was there anybody special,
some guy that maybe liked her?

29:51.757 --> 29:54.693
There was this guy,
didn't go to school here.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.995
AMITA:
Okay, I have it down

29:56.062 --> 29:57.663
to one programmer.

29:57.729 --> 30:02.034
So, that's the person behind
Vanguard's computer network.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.169
He worked as a tutor.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.972
Super smart,
had a huge crush on Lori.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.606
His name was Clayton.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.308
Here's his personal Web site.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.379
NIKKI: And now we think this is
the leader of the vigilantes.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.314
Clayton Caswell, studying
for his master's

30:15.381 --> 30:18.050
in computer engineering,
tutored Lori Sanchez.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.219
COLBY: Been missing three days,
so he's either

30:20.286 --> 30:21.921
hiding out or Tooner got to him,

30:21.988 --> 30:23.555
we just haven't
found his body yet.

30:23.622 --> 30:24.556
No, we'd have found him.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.624
Tooner would make sure of that.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.193
All right, well, run down every
place he can can be.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.928
I'll see if I can
get Charlie on it.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.562
Takes a nerd
to catch a nerd, huh?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.003
COLBY: All right, enough of the
"I don't know names" crap.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.405
I know you know
Clayton Caswell.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.873
What does it matter now?

30:40.940 --> 30:43.075
He's gonna die--
that's why it matters--

30:43.142 --> 30:44.643
and the rest of
Vanguard with him

30:44.710 --> 30:46.946
because Tooner has figured
out how to get to them.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.180
Clayton can handle it.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.481
He can't handle it.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.850
He's gonna get a lot
of people killed.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.086
So, where is he?

30:54.153 --> 30:55.721
I don't know, okay?

30:55.787 --> 30:59.291
I wasn't told where they'd hide
if it came to this.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.694
This is all about
a girl who died.

31:02.761 --> 31:07.199
I get why Clayton wants revenge
against Tooner for Lori Sanchez,

31:07.266 --> 31:09.135
but what about the
rest of you guys?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.437
Clayton's the type of guy...

31:13.539 --> 31:15.174
when he wants you
to do something,

31:15.241 --> 31:17.709
he makes you feel
like you can make a difference,

31:17.776 --> 31:19.545
like you're part
of something

31:19.611 --> 31:21.180
important and special.

31:21.247 --> 31:24.283
So, you guys want to be heroes?

31:24.350 --> 31:25.884
Yeah.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.587
Don't you?

31:33.125 --> 31:35.461
God, why am I so stupid?

31:35.527 --> 31:37.729
Do you want answers
one through 50,

31:37.796 --> 31:38.864
or 50 through a hundred?

31:38.931 --> 31:40.933
The regional cell matrix.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.969
That's the deep current.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.137
Tooner mines the regional
cell phone matrix

31:45.204 --> 31:47.273
for data on the movement
of merchandise.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.576
Vanguard mines Tooner's
cell matrix subset.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.244
You know, if we set
up derivatives...

31:52.311 --> 31:54.546
What, for all
regional cell calls?

31:54.613 --> 31:57.083
You realize that'll take days
on the supercomputer.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.585
Like you have a
better approach?

31:59.651 --> 32:01.653
Yeah, we'll just
narrow down the data set.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.123
It's quite logical.
Why are we fighting about it?

32:04.190 --> 32:05.291
Well, I'm not fighting.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.825
What else would you call this?

32:06.892 --> 32:08.160
I don't know. You started it.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.695
I did not.
Yes, you did.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.829
(computer chirps)

32:10.896 --> 32:12.131
What was that?

32:12.198 --> 32:14.166
It's an ongoing analysis
of the robberies

32:14.233 --> 32:15.867
and past
possible targets.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.504
That's a computer repair store.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.606
Vanguard's data said
Tooner hit that.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.641
There's no police
report of a break-in,

32:22.708 --> 32:23.809
so that's an anomaly.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.044
Maybe it wasn't reported.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.646
I mean, we need this information
for the data grid.

32:27.713 --> 32:30.116
Maybe Vanguard left
its graffiti symbol.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.385
Want to go on a field trip?

32:35.887 --> 32:37.423
So, where are
the Wonder Twins?

32:37.489 --> 32:40.326
Oh, they probably started
arguing, forgot all about food.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.594
Oh, man, I'm starving.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.236
Looks open.

32:58.677 --> 32:59.911
Hello?

32:59.978 --> 33:03.082
Hello? Hello.
Is anyone here?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.652
Hi. We're looking
for an owner

33:06.718 --> 33:08.120
or maybe a manager.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.022
Just whoever's in charge.

33:11.857 --> 33:13.659
That would be me.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.871
You here about a computer?

33:25.937 --> 33:28.374
Yeah. We, uh...
We were expecting a call

33:28.440 --> 33:31.043
about when to come
pick up our system.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.178
It's a, um,

33:32.244 --> 33:33.612
compact supercomputer.

33:33.679 --> 33:37.183
It's very valuable.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.450
Supercomputer?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.152
MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.921
Uh, eight serial CPUs, uh,

33:42.988 --> 33:44.690
vector processing.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.293
It's got a liquid-cooled
HVAC system.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.660
MARSHALL:
It's our baby.

33:48.727 --> 33:49.561
It can even calculate

33:49.628 --> 33:52.331
the path of, uh,
subatomic particles.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.467
Or play 300 versions of Halo
at the same time.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.603
Yeah, I think
I remember that one.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.072
My partner processed
that work order.

34:00.139 --> 34:03.209
I'd have to look for it.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.080
(phone ringing)

34:08.147 --> 34:09.348
Maybe that's him.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.182
Hello?

34:10.249 --> 34:11.883
CHARLIE:
Hey, listen, uh, we can find it

34:11.950 --> 34:13.619
if you don't know
what you're looking for.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.154
TOONER: Oh, feel free
to look around.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.422
After all,

34:16.488 --> 34:17.856
it's your supercomputer.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.625
As they say,

34:19.691 --> 34:20.926
mi casa es su casa.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.961
All right.
(laughs)

34:23.028 --> 34:25.697
Guys, I got to get.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.633
Got to be here somewhere.
-Yeah.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.935
Uh, well, uh, this...

34:30.001 --> 34:31.470
This isn't it.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.939
CHARLIE:
Um, I think maybe...

34:34.005 --> 34:35.241
(siren blaring)

34:35.307 --> 34:36.875
DON: Hey, Colby,
Charlie's on my cell.

34:36.942 --> 34:37.776
I need you to get a location

34:37.843 --> 34:39.645
and meet me there with LAPD.
You got it?

34:39.711 --> 34:41.313
COLBY:
Copy that. What's goin' on?

34:41.380 --> 34:42.814
I think he might be
with Tooner.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.483
MARSHALL:
Uh, did you

34:44.550 --> 34:46.352
change, the, uh,
decorative shell?

34:46.418 --> 34:47.653
No.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.787
TOONER:
Guys...

34:48.854 --> 34:51.690
sorry I can't wait around
for you to find your computer.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.292
Yeah. No, no, that's fine.
We'll just, uh...

34:53.359 --> 34:54.693
We'll just come back
in the morning. Thanks.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.162
Don't you want
to wait around

34:56.228 --> 34:58.830
for your brother,
Professor Eppes?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.969
Here's a math problem for you.

35:04.035 --> 35:07.673
Take the number of people
who've seen me at crime scenes.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.409
Subtract the number
who've testified.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.252
(siren blaring)

35:32.664 --> 35:34.400
He's gone.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.401
He was just here.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.968
In all of his
sociopathic glory.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.770
LAPD is running
traffic checks.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.639
I don't understand how
you guys ended up here.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.541
Well, we thought
it was an old crime scene,

35:42.608 --> 35:44.843
and it turned out
to be a currently active one.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.077
You okay?
-MARSHALL: Yeah.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.779
Adrenaline makes my skin itch.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.653
(in deep, resonant voice):
In a world where mathematicians

35:54.720 --> 35:56.822
go mano a mano
with a killer...

35:56.888 --> 36:00.226
(in deep voice):
This time, it's personal.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.427
We gotta get this guy.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.362
All right, he made me itch
in front of strangers.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.096
He told me he
was gonna kill me,

36:05.163 --> 36:06.365
you know, in
so many words.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.999
It's no wonder
the Vanguard kids hate him.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.167
He's quite hate-able.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.270
Yeah, if he killed one
of my friends,

36:11.337 --> 36:12.738
I'd go after him.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.040
Clayton Caswell and Tooner--
they hate each other.

36:15.106 --> 36:16.942
They want
a confrontation.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.945
It sounds like they created
a classic game theory scenario,

36:20.011 --> 36:21.413
doesn't it?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.981
Yes, it does,
Johnny Von Neumann.

36:23.048 --> 36:25.050
The old three-man gunfight.

36:25.116 --> 36:28.019
Mathematical gunfight, huh?

36:28.086 --> 36:29.255
MARSHALL:
Imagine a duel

36:29.321 --> 36:31.056
between three people, okay?

36:31.122 --> 36:32.391
Now, I'm the worst shot.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.527
I hit the target
once every three tries.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.463
One of my opponents is better.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.265
Hits it twice
every three shots.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.166
The third guy is a dead shot.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.601
He never misses.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.404
Come on.

36:45.471 --> 36:48.106
Now each gets one shot.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.941
As the worst, I go first.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.510
Then Charlie, then Colby.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.911
Who do I aim for
for my one shot?

36:52.978 --> 36:55.781
I guess me, 'cause
I'm the biggest danger, right?

36:55.847 --> 36:57.316
I shoot Eppsy first,

36:57.383 --> 36:58.784
but not for the
obvious reasons.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.119
Chances are two to one
I'm gonna miss.

37:01.186 --> 37:02.087
CHARLIE:
And now it's my turn.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.490
And logic says I shoot Colby.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.824
Right, 'cause
if I'm still standing,

37:05.891 --> 37:07.826
I'm gonna shoot you,
and I don't miss.

37:07.893 --> 37:08.994
Exactly.

37:09.060 --> 37:09.761
As the worst, I use

37:09.828 --> 37:11.363
the two better shooters
against each other.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.764
CHARLIE:
Vanguard and Tooner

37:12.831 --> 37:14.132
know their
communication skills

37:14.199 --> 37:15.200
better than we do.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.202
We can use that against them.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.904
We insert our info
into their systems,

37:18.970 --> 37:19.971
and make it work for us.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.740
(clicks tongue)

37:21.807 --> 37:23.909
CHARLIE: We created a target
that Tooner can't resist,

37:23.975 --> 37:25.911
and we made sure
that Vanguard knows about it.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.913
A setup? That's not
gonna be obvious?

37:27.979 --> 37:29.781
MARSHALL: Oh, not the way
we're doing it.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.683
They'll both think
that they've got data

37:31.750 --> 37:33.652
that the other side
doesn't know they have.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.154
Well, these guys
are gonna come ready for war,

37:36.221 --> 37:37.789
so we better gear up.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.326
We're using their hate
against each other.

37:40.392 --> 37:44.530
That's kind of ironic.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.131
Hey, I don't hate you.

37:46.197 --> 37:47.833
What?

37:47.899 --> 37:48.967
You hate me?

37:49.034 --> 37:51.102
Only when you call me Eppsy.

37:51.169 --> 37:55.307
Well, I guess it's just a way
of dealing with who you are.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.608
What do you mean,

37:56.675 --> 37:58.744
who I am?
-Charles Eppes.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.780
The guy everyone talks about.

38:01.847 --> 38:05.651
You know, you're a pretty
intimidating person.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.953
It's the second time today
I've gotten that.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.021
Only the second?

38:12.858 --> 38:15.226
Well, you're fairly challenging
yourself there, Marshall.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.928
No, seriously.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.830
Every time I come up
with something new,

38:18.897 --> 38:20.532
in the back
of my mind I'm thinking,

38:20.599 --> 38:21.733
"Penfield's gonna
tear this apart."

38:21.800 --> 38:24.436
No. You're just saying this
to be nice.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.038
How about a truce?

38:27.105 --> 38:29.441
Is this some game theory trick?

38:29.508 --> 38:31.276
If it was, I would be using

38:31.343 --> 38:32.911
a fourth-level
altruism ploy, right?

38:32.978 --> 38:35.246
It's a truce then.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.015
All right.

38:53.031 --> 38:56.435
How does it look?

38:56.502 --> 38:57.969
(over radio):
All clear.

38:58.036 --> 38:59.705
Okay.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.855
(beeping)

39:16.922 --> 39:19.057
2,200 cell phones,
800 iPods.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.092
Like going to a supermarket.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.562
(beeping)

39:23.629 --> 39:25.764
60-inch plasma TVs.

39:25.831 --> 39:26.865
32, to be exact.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.300
Okay, let's
get to work.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.102
Get these things open.
Come on.

39:33.472 --> 39:34.973
Now.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.709
(electrical crackling)

39:39.645 --> 39:41.079
(electricity pops, buzzes)

39:45.150 --> 39:47.385
Well!

39:47.453 --> 39:49.421
Well, that had
to be disappointing.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.457
What...

39:51.523 --> 39:55.927
you're fighting us with bombs
you cooked up in chem lab?

39:55.994 --> 39:58.864
Well, how did you think
this was going to end?

39:58.930 --> 40:01.500
What, you college boys can do

40:01.567 --> 40:06.071
what the LAPD
and the FBI can't? Huh?

40:07.372 --> 40:08.540
Huh?

40:08.607 --> 40:11.109
(helicopter whirring)

40:14.045 --> 40:15.313
FBI.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.983
Put the detonator down.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.785
(siren blaring)

40:24.523 --> 40:26.458
(officers shouting
indistinctly)

40:26.525 --> 40:28.527
Tooner, drop it!
Tooner, drop it right now.

40:30.996 --> 40:34.700
OFFICER (over P.A.): Don't move!
Put your weapon on the ground!

40:34.766 --> 40:35.701
Tooner!

40:39.104 --> 40:40.038
(sighs)

40:40.105 --> 40:42.173
Eat it!

40:57.556 --> 40:59.357
We killed you.

40:59.424 --> 41:01.126
(laughs)

41:01.192 --> 41:03.228
It's-It's done.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.230
(laughs)

41:06.364 --> 41:08.466
We killed you.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.201
You're done!

41:10.268 --> 41:12.203
(helicopter whirring)

41:14.806 --> 41:16.207
AMITA:
So, Marshall,

41:16.274 --> 41:18.009
how did you like
your second taste of FBI work?

41:18.076 --> 41:19.811
Oh, it's terrific,
with the exception

41:19.878 --> 41:21.980
of meeting the psychotic killer
face-to-face.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.115
I didn't like that.
-That wasn't optimal.

41:24.182 --> 41:24.983
No, it was not.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.018
Well, you two don't seem
to be fighting as much.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.420
Is that on purpose,
or did you just get tired of it?

41:29.487 --> 41:32.090
Oh, no, it's on purpose.
I never tire from an argument.

41:32.157 --> 41:32.924
LARRY:
Yes.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.926
Well, that's all too apparent.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.062
Marshall and I have found that
we can actually get along, huh?

41:37.128 --> 41:40.131
Yes. I should have stopped
calling you Eppsy years ago.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.232
That's all right.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.568
I've been called worse.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.769
DON:
Hey, everyone.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.971
What do you say, Chuck?

41:47.038 --> 41:48.039
Like that.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.274
Chuck.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.110
Yeah.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.511
I like that.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.814
I can work with that.
