Negan alive means to us.

- Her never coming to Alexandria,

30:42.840 --> 30:44.513
Yep.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.118
Why did you say those things?

31:49.200 --> 31:52.033
I wasn't trying to piss you off.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.077
You should know that.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.720
Why do you care what I think?

31:56.800 --> 31:58.677
'Cause you never come down here.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.671
It's always Rick or someone else.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.115
So tell me why that matters.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.793
[Sighs]

32:04.880 --> 32:06.712
I shouldn't have brought up your son.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.234
You weren't ready to hear it.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.112
Hear what?

32:10.200 --> 32:11.873
That we're the same.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.712
All or nothing.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.598
You are trapped, same as me.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.796
You're connected to the dead same as me.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.154
We are the same,

32:19.240 --> 32:21.959
and you can't stand that we're the same.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.512
No.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.912
We're not.

32:30.160 --> 32:34.472
Yeah, we do what we need to
to get shit done.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.437
But you get a kick out of it.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.989
Me?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.390
I'm trying every day
to make things better,

32:41.520 --> 32:43.750
thinking of ways
to bring people together,

32:43.840 --> 32:45.831
not pitting them against each other.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.072
I sacrifice, and I compromise.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.594
And, yeah, I do get strength
from the dead,

32:53.680 --> 32:55.273
but I live for the living,

32:55.360 --> 32:57.920
and I make no apologies for that.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.909
My sons are gone,

33:02.040 --> 33:04.190
but this world is going to be better
for my daughter

33:04.280 --> 33:07.716
and for every other child
that comes into it.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.917
Oh.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.560
You're not scared that you're like me.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.837
You're scared that
you're gonna end up like me--

33:17.920 --> 33:21.834
with everything
and everyone that you love gone.

33:25.280 --> 33:28.113
You're desperately
trying to connect with me.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.875
Because there is nothing worse
than nothing.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.957
Long as you're still breathing,

33:38.040 --> 33:40.316
it's not nothing.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.194
Time's up.

33:44.280 --> 33:46.317
Eat, Negan.

33:46.400 --> 33:50.234
One way or another,
you're gonna have to.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.390
[Grunts]

34:05.560 --> 34:06.834
Wait.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.797
What?

34:13.360 --> 34:14.589
Before you go,

34:14.679 --> 34:17.797
there is something I want to ask you.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.313
[Sighs]

34:24.520 --> 34:27.194
There are things in this world that--

34:27.280 --> 34:28.759
that we desperately hold on to

34:28.840 --> 34:31.195
when there's nothing left.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.554
This whole time,

34:39.679 --> 34:42.672
you thought I was
your last, best chance.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.271
[Chuckling] Oh, God.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.795
L-- I wanna see her.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.076
- I need to see her.
- No.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.958
Please.

34:54.040 --> 34:58.477
Negan, we don't have your bat.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.517
Where--

35:02.200 --> 35:04.874
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

35:04.960 --> 35:07.156
Still out there.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.038
No.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.999
[Voice breaking] No.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.549
Eat, Negan.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.711
Food's good.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.914
I am gonna see my Lucille.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.833
[Normal voice] Damn it.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.116
Damn!

- Rick: Yeah.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.076
Yeah. There's more coming!

36:21.640 --> 36:23.119
Think you can get to this one?

36:23.240 --> 36:25.629
[Panting] Yeah.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.112
- Let's go.
- Wait.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.470
I'm gonna stay back,
lead 'em away from the camp.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.198
- W hat?
- I'm staying.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.918
No, man!

39:14.000 --> 39:15.434
I'm not giving up on it, not yet.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.238
[Horse neighs]

39:17.320 --> 39:18.515
The river. Take 'em to the bridge.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.989
It ain't ever gonna hold,

39:21.080 --> 39:23.037
-and they'll get washed out to sea.
- No, man, I'm not sacrificing the bridge.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.110
I'll find another way.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.679
There ain't no other way, man!

39:25.800 --> 39:27.279
I'm not destroying the bridge.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.680
We need it.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.240
Fine.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.795
<i>H9'!-</i>

39:39.880 --> 39:40.836

"Game day was finally here.

The boys and girls were so excited.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.996
They washed their faces,

41:07.080 --> 41:09.230
they brushed their teeth,

41:09.360 --> 41:13.069
and they put on fresh, clean uniforms.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.190
They grabbed their gear,

41:25.280 --> 41:28.636
and then, they made their way
to the field."

41:30.040 --> 41:31.838
The end.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.990
Can I get a kiss right here?

- Mwah!
