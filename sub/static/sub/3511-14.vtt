WEBVTT

00:02.462 --> 00:03.546
They were on top of the world

00:03.547 --> 00:05.889
until the financial crisis
struck and they flamed out.

00:05.890 --> 00:08.231
That's when their wives
got busy taking over.

00:08.232 --> 00:10.341
"The Wives of Wall Street" --

00:10.342 --> 00:12.350
Penelope, the fashion mogul...

00:12.351 --> 00:14.459
you look amazing in my dress.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.534
Margo, the cosmetics queen...

00:16.535 --> 00:19.079
if you weren't my son,
I'd fire your ass.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.122
Colette, home decor diva...

00:21.123 --> 00:22.428
Let's sell today, people.

00:22.429 --> 00:24.436
And then of course
there's Hannah.

00:24.437 --> 00:27.081
What will she do next?

00:27.082 --> 00:29.391
Don't let anyone stop you

00:29.392 --> 00:32.136
from getting what you want.

00:32.137 --> 00:34.012
No, no, no.

00:34.013 --> 00:35.183
We need more Hannah.

00:35.184 --> 00:37.024
She's the reason
our numbers are spiking.

00:37.025 --> 00:38.532
We all like this
at the network, Peter.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.071
It's balanced.

00:40.072 --> 00:42.316
Maybe that works for your
brain-numbing finance shows.

00:42.317 --> 00:43.988
But this is reality tv.

00:43.989 --> 00:45.329
We need to hype the conflict.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.666
We need the unexpected.

00:46.667 --> 00:48.138
Uh, sorry to interrupt
Mr. Monroe.

00:48.139 --> 00:49.212
The police are calling for you.

00:49.213 --> 00:51.455
There's been a murder.

00:51.456 --> 00:53.364
Okay. Okay.
Heart-Shaped cuff links?

00:53.365 --> 00:55.070
Could you stop guessing?

00:55.071 --> 00:57.213
Okay, a pony?
It's a rocket.

00:57.214 --> 00:58.554
It's a limited-edition
"Star Wars" Lightsaber

00:58.555 --> 01:00.059
signed by George Lucas.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.234
Yes, because nothing says
"happy Valentine's day"

01:02.235 --> 01:03.441
like a "star wars" toy.

01:03.442 --> 01:05.147
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.156
Please tell me that you
didn't get me a lightsaber

01:07.157 --> 01:09.132
for our first Valentine's day
together.

01:09.133 --> 01:11.408
Please give me some credit.

01:11.409 --> 01:13.619
You are gonna love
what I got you.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.561
And you're gonna love
what I got you.

01:15.562 --> 01:17.100
What about you, espo?

01:17.101 --> 01:19.043
Any plans for
Valentine's day tomorrow?

01:19.044 --> 01:20.448
Uh, yeah.

01:20.449 --> 01:22.223
Investigating a murder.

01:22.224 --> 01:23.193
I see.

01:23.194 --> 01:24.700
Victim is Hannah Green, 23.

01:24.701 --> 01:26.308
She's one of the stars
of the show

01:26.309 --> 01:27.814
"The Wives of Wall Street."

01:27.815 --> 01:30.089
Her brother's on his way
into the precinct from jersey.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.732
"wives of wall street,"
the reality show?

01:31.733 --> 01:33.271
Yeah. Seen it?

01:33.272 --> 01:34.678
Just long enough to make me
want to kill myself.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.820
One minute of lunatics
backstabbing each other

01:36.821 --> 01:38.159
is enough.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.499
Speaking of backstabbing...

01:41.608 --> 01:44.285
She almost looks like
she's asleep.

01:44.286 --> 01:45.258
The bus driver
who came through last night

01:45.259 --> 01:47.132
at 11:15 thought she was.

01:47.133 --> 01:49.409
It wasn't until this morning
anyone realized she was dead.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.183
Based on liver temp,

01:51.184 --> 01:53.359
the earliest she could've died
is 10:00, 10:30.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.501
Okay, so she was killed
in that hour.

01:55.502 --> 01:56.740
Looks that way.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.282
There's no purse
or cell on the body

01:58.283 --> 02:01.260
but if she was mugged,
the doer missed

02:01.261 --> 02:03.604
that diamond tennis bracelet
on her right wrist.

02:03.605 --> 02:04.775
And if it was a mugger,

02:04.776 --> 02:06.450
he has exquisite taste
in cutlery.

02:06.451 --> 02:09.362
That's a takahara V.G.
Chef knife.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.535
Runs about 200 bucks.

02:10.536 --> 02:12.811
That's pretty high-end
for a murder weapon.

02:12.812 --> 02:14.250
Well, whoever attacked her,

02:14.251 --> 02:15.656
it looks she fought back.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.633
She has defensive wounds,
abrasions on her wrists,

02:17.634 --> 02:20.243
and some
possible genetic material

02:20.244 --> 02:21.584
underneath her fingernails.

02:21.585 --> 02:23.592
I'll run D.N.A. once I
get back to the morgue.

02:23.593 --> 02:24.831
She live in the area?

02:24.832 --> 02:26.906
No, downtown.
Thompson hotel.

02:26.907 --> 02:28.814
So what was she doing up here?

02:28.815 --> 02:29.953
I don't know.

02:29.954 --> 02:31.291
The producer of
"The Wives of Wall Street"

02:31.292 --> 02:32.800
Said they weren't filming
in this area.

02:32.801 --> 02:33.937
Hey.

02:33.938 --> 02:35.610
Sorry I'm... late.

02:35.611 --> 02:37.686
Yeah. Jenny again?

02:37.687 --> 02:38.858
Yeah.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.364
Her temperature
spiked this morning,

02:40.365 --> 02:41.703
and suddenly it's showtime.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.546
She's got this baby making
down to a science.

02:43.547 --> 02:44.985
Sounds romantic.

02:44.986 --> 02:46.692
I feel like a rooster
in a henhouse.

02:46.693 --> 02:48.134
Except for,
there's only one hen--

02:48.135 --> 02:50.710
a very bossy hen.

02:50.711 --> 02:52.619
Okay, espo, you and the rooster

02:52.620 --> 02:54.460
start a canvass,

02:54.461 --> 02:55.799
and Castle and I will talk
to the producer,

02:55.800 --> 02:58.077
see if he can give us
any background on Hannah's life.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.822
Look, I am not this person.

03:00.823 --> 03:03.567
Things just happen, and they...

03:03.568 --> 03:06.111
they end up defining you,
but it's...

03:06.112 --> 03:08.086
it's not always fair.

03:08.087 --> 03:09.761
That's it.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.008
That's the last image
we shot of Hannah.

03:13.009 --> 03:16.088
Poor girl.

03:16.089 --> 03:18.197
Such a loss.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.943
She was ratings gold.

03:20.944 --> 03:22.482
You're gonna have to find
who did this.

03:22.483 --> 03:23.622
The audience will want to know.

03:23.623 --> 03:25.965
Yeah, not to mention
her family, the d. A...

03:25.966 --> 03:27.973
Mr. Monroe,
when was this shot?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.480
Uh...

03:29.481 --> 03:31.623
day before yesterday,
around 8:00 p.M. Why?

03:31.624 --> 03:33.264
Because she's wearing
the same clothes

03:33.265 --> 03:34.804
that we found her in.

03:34.805 --> 03:36.277
That's a full day later.

03:36.278 --> 03:38.152
Do you know where she went
after filming

03:38.153 --> 03:40.629
or why she would've been
on the upper west side?

03:40.630 --> 03:42.638
Well, to be honest,
when the cameras go away,

03:42.639 --> 03:43.909
so do I.

03:43.910 --> 03:45.786
So I don't even know
what she did on her free time.

03:45.787 --> 03:48.966
In the video, she seems upset.
Any idea what about?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.306
Oh, you gotta understand,

03:50.307 --> 03:52.347
we brought Hannah in
to be Penelope's assistant.

03:52.348 --> 03:54.122
You know, to mix things up
a little bit.

03:54.123 --> 03:56.130
The small-Town girl
with the big-Time dreams

03:56.131 --> 03:57.637
of becoming a fashion designer.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.276
Will she make it with
The Wives of Wall Street?

03:59.277 --> 04:00.952
She's just milking it
for the camera.

04:00.953 --> 04:02.659
They all do.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.203
So it's a reality show,
just without the reality.

04:05.204 --> 04:09.054
I like to think of it
as heightened reality.

04:09.055 --> 04:10.794
Reality-Ish.

04:10.795 --> 04:11.999
In real reality,

04:12.000 --> 04:13.874
did she have problems
with anyone on the show?

04:13.875 --> 04:15.349
Well, you put a bunch of
tough-Minded women together,

04:15.350 --> 04:17.255
you're gonna get a spat or two.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.964
But Hannah
was part of the family.

04:18.964 --> 04:21.440
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
all of her tapes

04:21.442 --> 04:23.116
just in case
there's something relevant.

04:23.117 --> 04:24.421
Of course.

04:24.422 --> 04:28.204
Although, you might want
to check out her own family.

04:28.205 --> 04:31.050
I know that she had trouble
with her brother--Charlie green.

04:31.051 --> 04:34.197
Hannah always wanted
to make it big in the city,

04:34.198 --> 04:36.473
and when she came here,
she, uh,

04:36.474 --> 04:38.483
she lost her way.

04:39.454 --> 04:41.160
I should've done more.

04:41.161 --> 04:43.303
I was her brother.
I should've protected her.

04:43.304 --> 04:44.743
Mr. Green,

04:44.744 --> 04:47.154
when was the last time
you talked to Hannah?

04:47.155 --> 04:48.794
Uh, a few days ago.

04:48.795 --> 04:50.502
I called her. We fought.

04:50.503 --> 04:53.247
About what?

04:53.248 --> 04:54.485
The usual.

04:54.486 --> 04:56.294
About how she was putting
her life out there

04:56.295 --> 04:57.834
for the world to see,

04:57.835 --> 05:00.043
what it was doing
to the family.

05:00.044 --> 05:01.215
She...

05:01.216 --> 05:02.589
she said I didn't understand,

05:02.590 --> 05:04.797
that there was more
going on than I knew.

05:04.798 --> 05:07.442
But to me, it was simple--
She needed to come home.

05:07.443 --> 05:09.853
So... you didn't approve
of her

05:09.854 --> 05:11.495
being on
"The Wives of Wall Street"?

05:11.496 --> 05:12.832
Approve?

05:12.833 --> 05:14.540
No, it was killing us...

05:14.541 --> 05:17.420
to see the choices she made,
the way she was living her life,

05:17.421 --> 05:19.193
all of it out there
on national television.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.605
And that was before
she started having the affair.

05:21.606 --> 05:23.547
Affair?

05:23.548 --> 05:26.325
You screw my husband,
you think you're welcome here?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.937
He chose me, Penelope.

05:28.938 --> 05:30.511
Deal with it.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.592
I am coming for you.

05:34.964 --> 05:36.134
So our victim was sleeping
with the husband

05:36.135 --> 05:37.272
of one of the other women
in the show?

05:37.273 --> 05:38.544
Not just sleeping with.

05:38.545 --> 05:39.682
Hannah and Bob
moved in Together

05:39.683 --> 05:41.558
after Penelope
Found out about them.

05:41.559 --> 05:43.669
And yet the show's producer
said Nothing about it.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.179
I'd say he was covering
his own asset.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.125
This affair was broadcast
on national television.

05:49.126 --> 05:51.403
Did he really think that we
weren't gonna find out about it?

05:51.404 --> 05:53.477
Oh, my goodness.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.453
It was Penelope, wasn't it?

05:55.454 --> 05:57.529
Well, after what Hannah
did to her marriage,

05:57.530 --> 05:58.735
I wouldn't blame her.

05:58.736 --> 06:00.274
Okay,

06:00.275 --> 06:02.584
see, Penelope
kept her family afloat

06:02.585 --> 06:04.259
after Bob lost his job,

06:04.260 --> 06:06.736
and then she gives Hannah
this--This big break,

06:06.737 --> 06:08.443
and then Hannah repays her

06:08.444 --> 06:10.719
by screwing her
worthless excuse of a husband.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.428
You're a fan
of "wives of wall street"?

06:12.429 --> 06:14.704
Oh, yeah.
It's the best show on tv. Why?

06:14.705 --> 06:17.349
I don't--I just assumed
that a woman like you

06:17.350 --> 06:19.759
would prefer
more... sophisticated fare.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.735
Excuse me?

06:21.736 --> 06:23.610
W-What did you just say?

06:24.782 --> 06:26.288
Hey, Lanie. What's up?

06:26.289 --> 06:29.234
I'm sending you a picture
of a fingernail fragment

06:29.235 --> 06:30.675
I pulled
from the victim's scalp.

06:30.676 --> 06:33.587
I figured it came from
the killer during the attack.

06:33.588 --> 06:34.724
Can you run D.N.A.?

06:34.725 --> 06:35.865
It's already happening.

06:35.866 --> 06:37.438
Great. Thank you.

06:39.346 --> 06:41.623
'sito, is it just me or...

06:43.732 --> 06:45.909
is that a perfect match?

06:47.649 --> 06:49.155
Okay, wait a minute.

06:49.156 --> 06:50.629
You're reading
too much into this.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.211
Can you at least wait
until we're done filming?

06:54.212 --> 06:55.953
I am not having--
What a classy thing
to say.

06:55.954 --> 06:58.496
Oh, my--
You don't know how I meant it.

06:58.497 --> 07:00.505
Like she did it on purpose?
I'm not saying that.

07:00.506 --> 07:01.912
Well, we're not canceling
the wedding.

07:01.913 --> 07:04.824
Look, I'm just saying that
this sucks, okay?

07:04.825 --> 07:07.269
Hannah dying a month before
Our wedding...
Hush, Darling.

07:07.270 --> 07:10.515
Ashley's right. Maybe we should,
like, postpone it or something.

07:10.516 --> 07:11.820
Postpone?

07:11.821 --> 07:12.927
For that bitch?

07:12.928 --> 07:14.365
Penelope!

07:14.366 --> 07:15.672
Look, it's not like
I killed her.

07:16.843 --> 07:17.982
Excuse me, Ms. Foster.

07:17.983 --> 07:20.593
Detective Beckett, nypd.

07:20.594 --> 07:21.831
How do you do?

07:21.832 --> 07:23.003
I'm fine.

07:23.004 --> 07:24.744
Uh, but you...

07:24.745 --> 07:25.984
are under arrest

07:25.985 --> 07:27.958
for the murder of Hannah Green.

07:27.959 --> 07:30.001
So I guess it is
like you killed her.

07:30.002 --> 07:33.363
Are you still
rolling? Did you get that?

07:35.000 --> 07:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:44.024 --> 07:45.530
How dare you arrest me
in front of the cast and crew.

07:47.004 --> 07:49.581
You should be more worried
about this, Penelope.

07:49.582 --> 07:51.054
That's a lab report

07:51.055 --> 07:54.559
for a fingernail fragment
found in Hannah's hair.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.066
It's a D.N.A. match to you.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.640
You want to tell me
how it got there?

07:57.641 --> 07:59.079
Because if you won't,

07:59.080 --> 08:01.021
I'm sure your husband Bob will.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.561
Bob? Come on.

08:02.562 --> 08:04.035
What do you think
he's gonna tell you?

08:04.036 --> 08:05.909
That poor bastard is so stupid

08:05.910 --> 08:08.085
he thought Hannah
actually had feelings for him.

08:08.086 --> 08:10.295
And everybody knew
all she wanted to do

08:10.296 --> 08:12.304
was up her profile on the show.

08:12.305 --> 08:15.150
She was just using him.

08:15.151 --> 08:17.124
It was true love.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.703
Hannah and I were in love.

08:19.704 --> 08:22.081
Well, we know your wife Penelope
and Hannah had a fight.

08:22.082 --> 08:24.290
Had things been escalating
between them lately?

08:24.291 --> 08:26.065
Hannah and I never talked
about Penelope.

08:26.066 --> 08:28.072
But you lived with Hannah.

08:28.073 --> 08:29.714
Do you know where she was
last night?

08:29.715 --> 08:30.885
No.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.222
She didn't come home last night

08:32.224 --> 08:33.799
and I didn't see her
all day yesterday.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.102
Was that unusual?

08:35.104 --> 08:37.246
Yeah, I was worried.

08:37.246 --> 08:39.857
But do you really think
Penelope coulda killed her?

08:39.857 --> 08:41.198
Hell, yeah,
I wanted to kill her.

08:41.198 --> 08:42.736
But with all of America
watching?

08:42.738 --> 08:44.713
How stupid do you think I am?

08:44.714 --> 08:46.988
What about the fingernail?

08:46.989 --> 08:49.365
The truth is...

08:49.366 --> 08:52.010
Hannah and I did have
a little dustup.

08:52.011 --> 08:54.187
But not the night
that she was killed.

08:54.188 --> 08:55.827
It was the night before.

08:55.828 --> 08:59.309
Okay, so what was the nature
of this dustup?

08:59.310 --> 09:01.184
We were filming confessionals.

09:01.185 --> 09:03.193
Hannah waited for me
outside the studio,

09:03.194 --> 09:04.901
said she wanted to talk.

09:04.902 --> 09:07.076
About what?
Margo.

09:07.077 --> 09:10.090
Margo hired Hannah
after I fired her ass.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.932
And no surprise,

09:11.933 --> 09:14.174
Hannah and Margo
were having trouble at work.

09:14.175 --> 09:15.949
And crazy as it sounds,

09:15.950 --> 09:17.958
that bitch wanted me
to rehire her.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.967
Do you actually expect me
to believe

09:19.968 --> 09:21.943
that she asked you
for her job back

09:21.944 --> 09:23.985
after she ruined your marriage?

09:23.986 --> 09:25.291
Why do you think I lost it?

09:25.292 --> 09:27.902
I yanked her hair
and broke my nail.

09:27.903 --> 09:29.074
But that was it.

09:29.075 --> 09:31.316
She broke free, took off,

09:31.317 --> 09:32.923
and that was the last
I saw of Hannah.

09:32.924 --> 09:34.364
And I suppose
you won't mind me asking

09:34.365 --> 09:37.612
where you were between 10:15
and 11:15 last night?

09:39.586 --> 09:41.929
Okay, so the kickboxing teacher
at noho gym

09:41.930 --> 09:44.342
confirms that Penelope was
"sweating her ass off"

09:44.343 --> 09:47.252
downtown in a class
from 10:00 till 11:00.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.664
So whoever killed Hannah,

09:49.665 --> 09:52.041
it wasn't Penelope Foster.

09:52.042 --> 09:54.418
Okay, then. Where are we
on the murder weapon?

09:54.419 --> 09:57.096
You know what?
There's no fingerprints.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.636
But they did find
antimony oxide

09:58.637 --> 10:00.444
on the knife's handle.

10:00.445 --> 10:02.553
A fire retardant
if memory serves.

10:02.554 --> 10:04.093
And also, based on the wound,

10:04.094 --> 10:06.404
it looks like the knife
was new or had never been used.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.977
Hey, guys.
Check this out.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.315
A fan took this and posted it

10:09.316 --> 10:10.623
to a "wives of wall street"
Fan site

10:10.624 --> 10:12.296
the night of the murder.

10:12.297 --> 10:13.468
That's Hannah.

10:13.469 --> 10:14.638
Yeah, and it was time stamped.

10:14.639 --> 10:16.114
This is 20 minutes
before She was killed.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.519
20 minutes?

10:17.520 --> 10:19.024
So that building must have
something to do with the murder.

10:19.025 --> 10:20.364
Uh, any idea where it is?

10:20.365 --> 10:21.569
The photo wasn't geotagged,

10:21.570 --> 10:23.078
but you can see part of
the building's number

10:23.079 --> 10:24.249
ends in 46.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.388
And I can tell you
who lives here.

10:25.389 --> 10:27.027
I know this building.

10:27.028 --> 10:28.433
It's from the show.

10:28.434 --> 10:31.513
This is Margo's place,
somewhere on the upper west.

10:31.514 --> 10:32.484
South of 83rd.

10:32.485 --> 10:33.689
Wait. That means

10:33.690 --> 10:35.231
Margo Lives
right around the corner

10:35.232 --> 10:37.641
from where Hannah was killed.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.361
My mom's just wrapping up
a call,

10:42.362 --> 10:44.370
but she'll be right out,
as soon as s--

10:44.371 --> 10:46.479
I will talk to you later.
Here I am.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.818
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:47.819 --> 10:49.425
How can I help you?

10:49.426 --> 10:50.765
Uh, we just needed to go over

10:50.766 --> 10:53.710
the last 24 hours
of Hannah's life.

10:53.711 --> 10:55.485
And we were wondering,

10:55.486 --> 10:57.494
when was it
that you last saw her?

10:57.495 --> 10:58.901
She came by
around 10:00 last night

10:58.902 --> 11:00.574
for a few minutes. Why?

11:00.575 --> 11:03.253
Because she was killed
around the corner from here

11:03.254 --> 11:04.558
just after leaving.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.299
That's terrible.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.639
Yes, yes, it is.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.680
Um, would you mind telling us
why she came by?

11:09.681 --> 11:11.622
To apologize.

11:11.623 --> 11:13.666
For what?

11:15.775 --> 11:19.591
After Penelope fired Hannah
for the affair,

11:19.592 --> 11:22.604
I hired her to develop
a clothing line

11:22.605 --> 11:24.479
with my son Stone.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.224
I heard she had talent and...

11:27.225 --> 11:29.668
it wouldn't hurt to get
some screen time.

11:29.669 --> 11:31.577
Bob and Hannah's affair
has been

11:31.578 --> 11:34.690
the big story arc
these past few months.

11:34.691 --> 11:36.567
Three days ago,
she was supposed to come by

11:36.568 --> 11:38.976
and present her ideas.

11:38.977 --> 11:40.718
The "wives of wall street"
Cameras

11:40.719 --> 11:42.492
were here and ready to roll,

11:42.493 --> 11:44.533
and Hannah's a no-Show.

11:44.534 --> 11:45.672
Did she say why?

11:45.673 --> 11:46.776
No.

11:46.777 --> 11:49.522
If it was anyone else,
I would fire her.

11:49.523 --> 11:51.666
But it didn't hurt that you got
a little more screen time.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.673
I know that's crass,

11:53.674 --> 11:56.017
but that's how this works.

11:56.018 --> 11:57.558
When she came that night,

11:57.559 --> 11:58.864
Hannah only said She was worry

11:58.865 --> 12:01.106
and promised to recommit
to her job.

12:01.107 --> 12:03.617
Did she tell you where
she was going afterwards?

12:03.618 --> 12:06.027
No. I-I assumed that...

12:06.028 --> 12:07.735
She was going home.

12:07.736 --> 12:09.844
And what did you do
when she left?

12:09.845 --> 12:12.589
I jumped on a conference call
with my entertainment attorney

12:12.590 --> 12:16.875
to discuss
stone and Ashley's spin-off.

12:16.876 --> 12:18.715
So phone records confirm
that Margo made

12:18.716 --> 12:20.994
a 56-Minute phone call
to her entertainment lawyer

12:20.995 --> 12:25.145
at 10:23 from her landline
at the apartment.

12:25.146 --> 12:27.422
You know, the truth is
anyone who subscribes

12:27.423 --> 12:28.793
to the "wives of wall street"
Web site

12:28.794 --> 12:30.034
would've know that Hannah
was at Margo's building

12:30.035 --> 12:31.740
from that photo.

12:31.741 --> 12:33.748
They send out text alerts
any time there's a new post.

12:33.749 --> 12:35.759
And they have hundreds
of thousands of subscribers.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.800
Hey. I got
a little mystery here.

12:37.801 --> 12:38.940
You mean besides
your Valentine's day plans?

12:38.941 --> 12:40.947
Shh.

12:40.948 --> 12:42.654
Hannah's financials.

12:42.655 --> 12:44.831
For the past two months,
she's been making

12:44.832 --> 12:46.169
weekly cash deposits
of 5 grand.

12:46.170 --> 12:47.977
Now I checked with her family,
everyone on the show.

12:47.978 --> 12:49.751
No one knows
where it's coming from.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.895
I take it she didn't make it
selling girl scout cookies.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.836
Well, maybe it has something
to do with where she was

12:53.837 --> 12:55.747
when she missed
the pitch meeting with Margo

12:55.748 --> 12:57.286
on her fashion line.

12:57.287 --> 12:59.676
Credit card charge puts her
at a dive bar in Brooklyn

12:59.677 --> 13:01.182
called The Last Stop.

13:01.183 --> 13:03.425
A dive bar?
What was she doing there

13:03.426 --> 13:05.936
instead of at the most important
meeting of her life?

13:05.937 --> 13:07.642
I don't know. The bartender
said she was having

13:07.643 --> 13:09.016
a pretty heated discussion
with some dude,

13:09.017 --> 13:11.762
so I got the bartender sitting
down with a sketch artist.

13:11.763 --> 13:13.135
See if we can figure out
who he is.

13:13.136 --> 13:14.876
Hey.

13:16.249 --> 13:17.621
Uh, sorry.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.925
I had to run home and, uh...

13:18.926 --> 13:20.132
cock-a-doodle-doo?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.704
That's good.

13:21.705 --> 13:22.876
Uh, yeah.

13:22.877 --> 13:24.014
Tomorrow's going to be

13:24.015 --> 13:25.721
the least romantic
Valentine's day ever.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.995
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

13:26.996 --> 13:28.702
So I had tech

13:28.703 --> 13:30.176
look into Hannah's
last 24 hours,

13:30.177 --> 13:31.950
after her fight with Penelope

13:31.951 --> 13:33.624
and before showing up
at Margo's.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.895
And did they find
anything useful?

13:34.896 --> 13:36.203
They didn't find
anything at all.

13:36.204 --> 13:37.909
She didn't make any calls,

13:37.910 --> 13:39.214
didn't answer any calls,
sent no texts.

13:39.215 --> 13:40.754
She didn't even log on
to her e-Mail

13:40.755 --> 13:41.893
or any other online accounts.

13:41.894 --> 13:43.669
No digital fingerprint
whatsoever.

13:43.670 --> 13:45.241
Well, it's like
she disappeared.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.218
Why would she go radio silent
for 24 hours?

13:47.219 --> 13:49.058
And where the hell was she?

13:49.059 --> 13:50.866
I'll tell you
where she was--

13:50.867 --> 13:52.841
Madagascar.

13:52.842 --> 13:54.046
As in the country

13:54.047 --> 13:55.722
off the southeastern coast
of africa,

13:55.723 --> 13:58.098
made famous by
the adorable animated film?

13:58.099 --> 14:00.910
Yep. The material I found
underneath her fingernails--

14:00.911 --> 14:02.852
Not skin from an attacker.

14:02.853 --> 14:03.790
It's alluaudia.

14:03.791 --> 14:05.329
And what is alluaudia?

14:05.330 --> 14:07.204
A rare spiny plant

14:07.205 --> 14:10.184
cultivated primarily
in Madagascar.

14:10.185 --> 14:11.825
So how did it get
under her fingernails?

14:11.826 --> 14:13.164
Beats me.

14:13.165 --> 14:14.771
As for her defensive wounds,

14:14.772 --> 14:16.880
they were not sustained
at the time of murder.

14:16.881 --> 14:19.692
They're from 24 hours prior.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.997
That's about the time
that she went off the grid,

14:20.998 --> 14:22.874
which means there's gotta be
a connection.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.016
Oh, I think there is.

14:25.017 --> 14:27.326
Remember this abrasion?

14:27.327 --> 14:28.015
Yeah.

14:28.016 --> 14:29.356
Well, I figured out
what caused it.

14:29.357 --> 14:31.397
Her diamond tennis bracelet.

14:31.398 --> 14:33.909
But wasn't that...

14:33.910 --> 14:35.282
on her right wrist?

14:35.283 --> 14:36.554
Good memory.

14:36.555 --> 14:38.094
So her wrists
were tied together.

14:38.095 --> 14:40.036
Tight and for several hours.

14:40.037 --> 14:41.209
Now it's making sense--

14:41.210 --> 14:43.384
Wearing the same clothes
overnight...

14:43.385 --> 14:45.058
the radio silence...

14:45.059 --> 14:47.067
And the defensive wounds
24 hours prior to death.

14:47.068 --> 14:49.679
Hannah was held hostage.

14:55.902 --> 14:56.872
If Hannah
was being held hostage,

14:56.873 --> 14:58.279
then why didn't she report it?

14:58.280 --> 15:01.296
And how did she get magically
transported to Madagascar?

15:01.297 --> 15:03.205
And why would she go
afterwards to Margo's

15:03.206 --> 15:04.845
to apologize for missing work?

15:04.846 --> 15:07.290
It has to have something to do
with those $5,000 payments

15:07.291 --> 15:09.398
and that meeting
with that mystery man

15:09.399 --> 15:11.139
at the bar in Brooklyn.

15:11.140 --> 15:13.115
It all seems so random.

15:13.116 --> 15:14.452
I mean,
I know by the end of this,

15:14.453 --> 15:16.229
all of these clues
will fit together beautifully

15:16.230 --> 15:18.069
in a murderous mosaic.
Mm-hmm.

15:18.070 --> 15:21.083
But... how?
Mm.

15:21.084 --> 15:22.187
Wait.

15:22.188 --> 15:26.305
Is this
your Valentine's day gift to me,

15:26.306 --> 15:28.215
a complex mystery
where nothing makes sense?

15:28.216 --> 15:29.955
You know me so well.

15:29.956 --> 15:34.274
Um, I hate to interrupt your
little, uh, love connection.

15:34.275 --> 15:36.149
But I checked traffic cameras.

15:36.150 --> 15:37.320
I found footage of Hannah

15:37.321 --> 15:38.492
arriving at Margo's building
in a taxi.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.335
I got the medallion.
I talked to the cabbie,

15:40.336 --> 15:43.179
whose log showed that he picked
up Hannah at 78th and Lex.

15:43.180 --> 15:45.020
Did he say
where she was coming from--

15:45.021 --> 15:46.225
Building, store?

15:46.226 --> 15:47.497
He didn't know.
He said that she was

15:47.498 --> 15:48.970
standing on the corner
when she flagged him down.

15:48.971 --> 15:50.242
Well, then she could've
come from anywhere.

15:50.243 --> 15:51.950
There's no way we can
narrow that down, bro.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.122
Maybe there is.

15:53.123 --> 15:54.194
I spoke to a regulator

15:54.195 --> 15:55.534
at the department
of agriculture.

15:55.535 --> 15:57.375
It seems alluaudia

15:57.376 --> 15:59.685
is used in Green
sustainable architecture

15:59.686 --> 16:03.100
in rugs, flooring, wallpaper,

16:03.101 --> 16:04.541
possibly from a building
nearby.
All right.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.682
Espo, you get uniforms
to canvass the area

16:06.683 --> 16:08.222
around 78th and lex

16:08.223 --> 16:09.730
and see if there's any
green sustainable buildings

16:09.731 --> 16:13.043
that might use that allu--
Whatever the plant is.

16:13.044 --> 16:14.215
As you wish.

16:14.216 --> 16:15.588
Captain gates,

16:15.589 --> 16:18.669
participating in the case,
engaging in Idle speculation--

16:18.670 --> 16:21.180
We are not so different,
you and I.

16:22.352 --> 16:24.059
There's...
there's a difference.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.298
We're different.

16:25.299 --> 16:28.244
You know, this could actually
be our big break,

16:28.245 --> 16:30.151
only we may not
have gotten to it

16:30.152 --> 16:34.169
if I hadn't recognized
Margo's building in that photo,

16:34.170 --> 16:36.312
which is why I think
each of you should watch

16:36.313 --> 16:39.459
Some "wives of wall street"
Episodes tonight--

16:39.460 --> 16:41.235
for the good of the case.

16:42.808 --> 16:44.448
So...

16:44.449 --> 16:46.324
would you like to come over
for a little viewing party?

16:46.325 --> 16:49.102
So you can Badger me about
what I'm getting you

16:49.103 --> 16:50.474
for Valentine's day?

16:50.475 --> 16:52.315
No, thanks.
I think I will pass.

16:52.316 --> 16:53.654
Okay, but I'm warning you,

16:53.655 --> 16:55.632
I'm kind of competitive
when it comes to giving gifts.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.639
Don't feel bad if yours isn't
as good as mine.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.811
What if it's better?

16:58.812 --> 17:00.250
Better?

17:00.251 --> 17:01.422
Mm-hmm.

17:01.423 --> 17:02.628
How could it possibly
be better?

17:02.629 --> 17:05.441
Oh, I guess it just depends
on what you got me.

17:06.881 --> 17:10.327
Oh, Richard.
These are breathtaking.

17:10.328 --> 17:12.471
Beckett is
going to love them, dad.

17:12.472 --> 17:13.776
Right?

17:13.777 --> 17:15.652
She'll have a tough time
competing with that.

17:15.653 --> 17:17.727
One of the perils
of dating a gift ninja.

17:17.728 --> 17:19.501
Ooh, you want to be
a real ninja?

17:19.502 --> 17:21.411
You just slip these
into her coat pocket

17:21.412 --> 17:23.419
when she's not looking.
Ooh.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.429
Mother, I like that idea.
The element of surprise.

17:25.430 --> 17:26.598
The ninja way.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.776
What about you, Alexis?
Any plans with Max?

17:28.777 --> 17:30.484
Uh, we're just
going to study together.

17:30.485 --> 17:32.458
Doesn't sound very special.

17:32.459 --> 17:35.572
Well, I think we'll mostly
just study each other's eyes.

17:35.573 --> 17:37.949
And you, mother,
any special plans?

17:37.950 --> 17:40.427
We're gonna do dramatic readings
of "Love letters"

17:40.428 --> 17:41.565
at my studio.

17:41.566 --> 17:42.971
Oh, well, that's nice.

17:42.972 --> 17:45.616
And speaking of drama,
would anyone like to join me

17:45.617 --> 17:47.491
for a screening of
"wives of wall street,"

17:47.492 --> 17:48.864
popcorn Included?

17:48.865 --> 17:52.579
2-Hour lunches
are not acceptable, Hannah.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.455
We're running a business here.

17:54.456 --> 17:56.631
I wasn't at lunch.
I was getting fabric samples.

17:56.632 --> 17:59.008
That is no excuse
for being late.

17:59.009 --> 18:00.583
You are not
in kansas anymore, toto...

18:00.584 --> 18:02.088
shoot me now.

18:02.089 --> 18:04.599
Boy, I wish I'd had
these reality shows in my day.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.675
No script, overacting,

18:06.676 --> 18:08.383
screaming at everybody--
What a gig.

18:08.384 --> 18:11.864
Now I have written
New promo copy.

18:11.865 --> 18:13.672
Proofread it.

18:13.673 --> 18:16.116
So what's going on
between you two?

18:16.117 --> 18:17.622
Nothing.

18:17.623 --> 18:18.894
What do you mean?

18:18.895 --> 18:20.636
You're sleeping with her,
aren't you, Bob?

18:20.637 --> 18:22.678
No. No.

18:22.679 --> 18:24.184
Don't lie to me.

18:24.185 --> 18:26.696
You're screwing Hannah!
Admit it.

18:26.697 --> 18:29.575
Admit it!

18:29.576 --> 18:30.914
YES! All right?

18:30.915 --> 18:32.824
I'm sorry.

18:34.565 --> 18:36.573
He chose me, Penelope.
Deal with it.

18:37.745 --> 18:38.750
You come near me again,

18:38.751 --> 18:41.695
and I will rip your throat out.

18:41.696 --> 18:43.704
Coming up next week--
Margo's son stone,

18:43.705 --> 18:45.680
who's learning the family
business from mom,

18:45.681 --> 18:48.625
and Colette's daughter Ashley,
budding ceramic entrepreneur,

18:48.626 --> 18:49.630
get engaged.

18:49.631 --> 18:50.968
Strap in as their moms get busy

18:50.969 --> 18:52.677
planning their
Fairy-Tale wedding.

18:52.678 --> 18:54.584
Coming up next--
The "shark pool"

18:54.585 --> 18:56.895
With bad-Boy billionaire
Mike chilean.

18:56.896 --> 18:58.669
You're funded!

18:58.670 --> 19:01.013
Oh, my god, dad.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.792
You're still watching?

19:03.793 --> 19:06.772
I...

19:06.773 --> 19:08.814
I can't feel my butt.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.154
That's exactly what I mean.

19:10.155 --> 19:11.693
Hannah didn't stand a chance.

19:11.694 --> 19:14.807
I mean, she's a small-Town,
naive young woman.

19:14.808 --> 19:16.113
She was chum to piranhas.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.188
Yeah, But look what
she did to Bob.

19:18.189 --> 19:19.728
Okay, okay,

19:19.729 --> 19:21.301
do you really think
that she played him,

19:21.302 --> 19:23.109
that Penelope was right
about that?

19:23.110 --> 19:25.386
Oh, that girl was smarter than
anybody gave her credit for.

19:25.387 --> 19:27.092
You know what?
I think you're right.

19:27.093 --> 19:28.266
What about you, detective?

19:28.267 --> 19:29.638
Did you watch

19:29.639 --> 19:31.079
"Wives of wall street"
last night?

19:31.080 --> 19:32.919
I watched an episode.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.090
Just one episode?

19:34.091 --> 19:35.798
That's like eating
one potato chip.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.406
I usually just eat
one potato chip.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.749
So what's the status
on the canvass, detective?

19:39.750 --> 19:41.657
Uh, uniforms are still
making their way

19:41.658 --> 19:43.868
through Every building that
uses any trace of alluaudia

19:43.869 --> 19:45.207
on the upper east side,

19:45.208 --> 19:46.780
so nothing yet.

19:46.781 --> 19:49.023
Yo. You guys
aren't gonna believe this.

19:49.024 --> 19:51.031
The sketch of the guy
that Hannah met

19:51.032 --> 19:53.307
in Brooklyn out at that
little restaurant just came in.

19:53.308 --> 19:55.151
Was anyone at the bar
able to I.D. Him?

19:55.152 --> 19:57.293
They didn't need to.

19:57.294 --> 19:58.766
That's Mike chilean.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.105
The crazy billionaire?

20:00.106 --> 20:01.378
And the entrepreneur host
of the financial channel's

20:01.379 --> 20:04.290
other hit reality tv show--
The "Shark Pool."

20:04.291 --> 20:06.064
So why would Hannah

20:06.065 --> 20:08.073
ditch her shot to pitch Margo
a clothing line

20:08.074 --> 20:11.923
to meet with chilean
at a seedy bar in Brooklyn?

20:11.924 --> 20:13.397
Meeting at that dump
was her idea.

20:13.398 --> 20:16.141
Me, I'm more
of a le cirque guy.

20:16.142 --> 20:19.389
But she said
she needed privacy.

20:19.390 --> 20:20.930
For what?

20:20.931 --> 20:22.437
We met last month
at a financial channel party.

20:22.438 --> 20:23.876
She was...

20:23.877 --> 20:26.019
cute and young.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.225
Then a few days ago,

20:27.226 --> 20:29.400
she calls me out of the blue
and asked to meet.

20:29.401 --> 20:31.207
So it was a date?

20:31.208 --> 20:32.915
That's what I thought, yes.

20:32.916 --> 20:35.225
But when I get there...

20:35.226 --> 20:37.502
She goes all "Shark pool"
on me.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.976
Starts pitching her idea

20:38.977 --> 20:42.625
for a vegan, organic, hipster
clothing line.

20:42.626 --> 20:45.303
Wait. She asked you
to fund her clothing line?

20:45.304 --> 20:48.986
Margo Gower was set
to back it on the show.

20:48.987 --> 20:50.493
Well, that was the weird part.

20:50.494 --> 20:52.402
I was ready to offer
her financing.

20:52.403 --> 20:54.577
Her name recognition
from the show

20:54.578 --> 20:56.485
almost guarantees a profit.

20:56.486 --> 20:58.360
But then she says,

20:58.361 --> 20:59.966
"what if I were to leave
the show?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.240
Would that make a difference?"

21:01.241 --> 21:04.052
she told you that she might
leave the show?
Yep.

21:04.053 --> 21:06.060
So I said,

21:06.061 --> 21:09.744
"Yes, sweetie, that would make
a big difference."

21:09.745 --> 21:12.758
Without the show,
her brand isn't worth jack.

21:16.072 --> 21:18.080
Why would Hannah suddenly
want to leave the show

21:18.081 --> 21:19.253
after everything
she ever dreamed of

21:19.254 --> 21:21.261
started happening for her?

21:21.262 --> 21:23.136
Well, whatever was going on,
she clearly wanted...

21:23.137 --> 21:25.078
to keep it under wraps.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.526
Hey.

21:29.527 --> 21:31.000
Uniforms just got a hit
on the canvass

21:31.001 --> 21:33.543
from a pretzel vendor
who saw Hannah

21:33.544 --> 21:34.714
walk into a nearby building

21:34.715 --> 21:36.590
right in
our abduction time frame.

21:36.591 --> 21:38.533
Records show
It's l.E.E.D. Certified

21:38.534 --> 21:40.038
green construction.

21:40.039 --> 21:41.580
Any evidence of alluaudia
in the building?

21:41.581 --> 21:42.884
I checked.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.592
It's in the wallpaper.

21:44.593 --> 21:46.166
She was held hostage
someplace in that building.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.538
Find out where.

21:47.539 --> 21:48.510
Castle, let's go.

21:48.511 --> 21:49.682
On my way.

21:50.954 --> 21:52.193
Oh, you got
the wrong blazer there.

21:52.194 --> 21:53.968
No, I don't. Let's go.

21:58.990 --> 22:01.165
Is everything all right,
Mr. Castle?

22:01.166 --> 22:02.539
Uh...

22:04.212 --> 22:05.752
Castle.

22:05.753 --> 22:06.991
Come on.

22:08.966 --> 22:10.639
Yeah, that's definitely her.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.212
Have you ever seen her
in the building before?

22:12.213 --> 22:14.056
Uh, no. It was just
the one time the other night.

22:14.057 --> 22:16.164
I was doing rounds
when I saw her go into 29-J.

22:16.165 --> 22:17.804
And who owns 29-J?

22:17.805 --> 22:20.315
Ocean terrace holdings.
It's a corporation.

22:20.316 --> 22:21.620
Is there a name listed on it?

22:21.621 --> 22:22.926
Uh, no.
A lot of people buy units

22:22.927 --> 22:24.834
under corporate names
for privacy, so...

22:24.835 --> 22:26.812
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Do you hear that?

22:28.586 --> 22:30.026
Sounds like someone
pounding on a wall.

22:47.435 --> 22:49.410
Penelope?

22:51.922 --> 22:53.092
And Bob?!

22:53.093 --> 22:55.704
You two are back toge--

22:55.705 --> 22:57.032
Spoiler alert.

23:03.941 --> 23:05.848
Bob and Penelope together?

23:05.849 --> 23:06.988
I can't believe it.

23:06.989 --> 23:09.229
I know, right?

23:09.230 --> 23:11.907
Neither of them is talking
about Hannah.

23:11.908 --> 23:13.950
Well, clearly they have
a lot more to hide

23:13.951 --> 23:15.525
than the fact that they were
sleeping together.

23:15.526 --> 23:18.336
Well, this is a plot twist
I didn't see coming.

23:18.337 --> 23:21.082
Hey, so I did some digging
on the apartment.

23:21.083 --> 23:24.028
Ocean Terrance holdings,
it's a shell company

23:24.029 --> 23:25.936
owned by Bob.

23:25.937 --> 23:28.080
The lease began just after he
and Hannah started their affair.

23:28.081 --> 23:29.351
That's odd.

23:29.352 --> 23:31.929
When Bob left Penelope,

23:31.930 --> 23:34.272
he moved into the Thompson hotel
with Hannah.

23:34.273 --> 23:36.984
So why would he lease
another apartment?

23:36.985 --> 23:38.056
Yo.

23:38.057 --> 23:40.232
I looked into
Penelope's financials.

23:40.233 --> 23:42.106
Remember those $5,000 payments
that Hannah got?

23:42.107 --> 23:44.284
They line up exactly with
withdrawals that Penelope made

23:44.285 --> 23:45.891
from her checking account.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.033
Penelope was paying Hannah?

23:48.034 --> 23:51.113
Wh-Why would she do that?

23:51.114 --> 23:54.126
There's no way to know
unless we get her to talk.

23:54.127 --> 23:55.901
I'm s--I'm sorry.
Have you seen the show?

23:55.902 --> 23:57.408
Penelope is the strong one.

23:57.409 --> 23:59.182
If anyone's gonna talk...

23:59.183 --> 24:00.120
it's Bob.

24:00.121 --> 24:01.291
But he's not.

24:01.292 --> 24:03.167
And my guess is,
he's afraid of Penelope.

24:03.168 --> 24:05.040
Well, then perhaps it's time

24:05.041 --> 24:06.950
to tear a page
from Penelope's play book.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.503
Oh, come on. You guys
aren't actually--

24:11.504 --> 24:13.412
Couldn't hurt.

24:19.471 --> 24:21.211
I told you,
I have nothing to--

24:21.212 --> 24:23.555
did I say you could talk?

24:23.556 --> 24:27.339
Did someone give you permission
to open your sorry little mouth?

24:27.340 --> 24:28.677
No!

24:28.678 --> 24:31.390
So sit down, shut up,
and listen.

24:31.391 --> 24:35.139
We know
that apartment's yours, Bob.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.220
We know that Hannah
was held hostage there,

24:38.221 --> 24:40.228
which means...

24:40.229 --> 24:42.203
I can nail you for kidnapping.

24:42.204 --> 24:44.212
That's 20 years, easy.

24:44.213 --> 24:46.624
What? No. I--
but you know what?
I'm not gonna stop there.

24:46.625 --> 24:47.795
I am going to

24:47.796 --> 24:50.172
fry you for murder.

24:50.173 --> 24:53.151
Wait. Me?
I-I didn't kill her.

24:53.152 --> 24:54.191
Don't lie to me!

24:54.192 --> 24:55.528
You locked her up.

24:55.529 --> 24:57.203
You held her hostage.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.677
Who does that to someone
that they love,

24:58.678 --> 25:00.418
you lying sack of...

25:04.736 --> 25:05.908
We weren't in love, okay?!

25:05.909 --> 25:08.385
It was a lie.
The whole thing was a lie.

25:08.386 --> 25:09.723
There was no relationship.

25:09.724 --> 25:11.366
Hannah and I were never
even together.

25:11.367 --> 25:12.771
What?!

25:12.772 --> 25:14.579
We only did it for the ratings.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.918
The ratings?

25:15.919 --> 25:17.525
Ashley and stone's engagement

25:17.526 --> 25:19.534
was sucking up
all the attention on the show.

25:19.535 --> 25:21.310
Penelope's screen time
was dropping,

25:21.311 --> 25:23.484
which was killing
her clothing sales.

25:23.485 --> 25:25.326
She was out of her mind.

25:25.327 --> 25:27.971
So we came up with a plan.

25:27.972 --> 25:30.348
Hannah was reluctant at first,

25:30.349 --> 25:32.423
But Penelope can be
pretty persuasive.

25:32.424 --> 25:35.537
So the $5,000 that Penelope
was paying Hannah,

25:35.538 --> 25:37.948
that was to fake
a relationship?

25:37.949 --> 25:40.962
We never intended
for it to end like this.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.351
What happened, Bob?

25:46.352 --> 25:47.488
The other night,

25:47.489 --> 25:48.930
after taping her confessional,

25:48.931 --> 25:50.871
Hannah said she needed to talk.

25:50.872 --> 25:52.613
Well, the three of us
couldn't be seen together,

25:52.614 --> 25:54.888
so we met at the apartment.

25:54.889 --> 25:56.629
She told us she couldn't bear

25:56.630 --> 25:58.338
everyone thinking
she was this home wrecker.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.011
She couldn't go on
living a lie.

26:00.012 --> 26:01.954
Yeah, she said She was
gonna go public,

26:01.955 --> 26:04.431
reveal the affair
had been faked all along.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.809
That's a pretty big bombshell.
How'd you guys take it?

26:06.810 --> 26:08.381
How'd we take it?
We panicked.

26:08.382 --> 26:10.021
If we let her
go through with it,

26:10.022 --> 26:11.393
it would blow up the show.

26:11.394 --> 26:12.598
We'd lose all creditability.

26:12.599 --> 26:14.138
No one would buy
Penelope's clothes anymore.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.648
Plus, we'd be
in breach of contract

26:15.649 --> 26:18.090
and the show could Sue us
for every cent we had.

26:18.091 --> 26:19.832
Our whole Lives
would be ruined.

26:19.833 --> 26:21.136
So then you guys tied her up.

26:21.137 --> 26:22.511
We didn't know what to do.

26:22.512 --> 26:23.849
So a whole day went by.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.528
We realized we couldn't
hold her forever s--

26:27.767 --> 26:29.574
So we made a call.

26:29.575 --> 26:31.850
So who'd you call?

26:31.851 --> 26:33.591
Bob!

26:33.592 --> 26:34.564
Who'd you call?

26:34.565 --> 26:36.069
Peter Monroe.

26:36.070 --> 26:38.848
The "Wives of Wall Street"
producer?

26:38.849 --> 26:40.454
Yeah, we needed help.

26:40.455 --> 26:42.531
It's his show. He had
as much to lose as we did.

26:42.532 --> 26:44.774
What did you tell him?

26:44.775 --> 26:47.184
Everything.

26:47.185 --> 26:49.562
Then he came over and told
Penelope and me to leave,

26:49.563 --> 26:51.537
that he would handle Hannah.

26:51.538 --> 26:53.547
We thought he was just gonna
talk some sense into her,

26:53.548 --> 26:55.722
you know,
maybe sweeten her deal.

26:55.723 --> 26:58.233
But the next thing we knew,

26:58.234 --> 27:00.276
Hannah was dead.

27:07.171 --> 27:08.757
I'm so sorry, sir.
I tried to stop them.

27:08.758 --> 27:10.132
Jeff, get outta here.
Right.

27:10.133 --> 27:12.813
Mr. Monroe, are you
pathologically incapable

27:12.814 --> 27:14.025
of telling the truth?

27:14.026 --> 27:15.367
Well, that depends.
What's this about?

27:15.368 --> 27:17.107
Your role in Hannah's murder.

27:17.108 --> 27:19.919
Whoa. I had nothing
to do with her murder.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.458
Bob thinks you did.

27:21.459 --> 27:23.702
We know about him
calling you from the apartment

27:23.703 --> 27:25.377
about Hannah
just before she died.

27:25.378 --> 27:28.925
Okay, Penelope and Bob
called me.

27:28.926 --> 27:31.302
Couple of moron idiots...

27:31.303 --> 27:33.244
taking her hostage like that.

27:33.245 --> 27:34.416
So you went over there?

27:34.417 --> 27:35.922
Of course I went over there.

27:35.923 --> 27:37.931
Hell, I saved her
from those two lunatics.

27:37.932 --> 27:39.236
I'm the good guy.

27:39.237 --> 27:40.878
You know what I did
when I got there?

27:40.879 --> 27:42.284
I let her go. Water?

27:42.285 --> 27:43.890
Please.

27:43.891 --> 27:45.465
Look, if Hannah exposed that
your main storyline was faked,

27:45.466 --> 27:47.975
your show
would go down in flames.

27:47.976 --> 27:49.783
The fans would be outraged.

27:49.784 --> 27:51.858
Hell, I'm outraged.

27:51.859 --> 27:53.031
I was trying to stop her.

27:53.032 --> 27:55.039
I offered Hannah more money,
her own series,

27:55.040 --> 27:56.076
anything she wanted

27:56.077 --> 27:57.417
to not blow the lid
off the show.

27:57.418 --> 27:59.860
I mean...

27:59.861 --> 28:01.902
She was gonna ruin everything.

28:01.903 --> 28:03.811
I begged her to stay.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.055
I followed her out and gave her
every decent pitch I had.

28:06.056 --> 28:07.996
But she wouldn't deal.

28:07.997 --> 28:09.537
She got into a taxi,
and I never saw her again.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.144
Here's a better story--

28:11.145 --> 28:14.022
You grabbed a knife
and you followed her.

28:14.023 --> 28:16.031
No, I didn't. I swear.

28:16.032 --> 28:17.505
I went straight to
the player's club,

28:17.506 --> 28:19.011
ordered a couple of cocktails,

28:19.012 --> 28:22.192
and waited for my world
to start to cave in.

28:22.193 --> 28:25.003
But nothing happened.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.214
Next morning, I found out
that she was dead.

28:27.215 --> 28:29.624
So the manager
at the player's club confirms

28:29.625 --> 28:31.299
that Monroe was there
from 10:00 p.M.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.938
Till Well after midnight.

28:32.939 --> 28:34.145
He's not our guy.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.684
Which leaves Margo,

28:35.685 --> 28:38.162
because that's where
Hannah went next, but...

28:38.163 --> 28:40.171
after being held hostage

28:40.172 --> 28:41.677
and demanding
to leave the show,

28:41.678 --> 28:44.221
I doubt she went there
to recommit to the job.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.531
Margo had to have been
lying to us.

28:46.532 --> 28:48.206
Margo was lying, all right.

28:48.207 --> 28:50.149
She told you she buzzed up
Hannah that night, right?

28:50.150 --> 28:51.688
Mm-Hmm.
That's impossible.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.360
The buzzer on the building
connects through her phone.

28:53.361 --> 28:54.702
According to the phone records,

28:54.703 --> 28:57.044
Hannah was buzzed up
at 9:57 p.M.

28:57.045 --> 28:58.585
Well, according to
Margo's financials,

28:58.586 --> 29:01.296
at almost exactly
the same time, 9:58 p.M.,

29:01.297 --> 29:02.367
she was using her credit card

29:02.368 --> 29:03.707
at Lorenzo's deli
ten blocks away.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.214
Thanks, espo.

29:05.215 --> 29:07.154
Margo's got
some explaining to do.

29:07.155 --> 29:09.031
If she didn't buzz Hannah in,
then who did?

29:09.032 --> 29:11.174
And why would she lie about it?

29:24.097 --> 29:26.307
Castle, what's going on
with you and gates today?

29:26.308 --> 29:28.415
What do you mean?

29:28.416 --> 29:30.123
Seriously, Castle,

29:30.124 --> 29:31.428
what were you thinking?

29:31.429 --> 29:32.833
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

29:32.834 --> 29:34.342
By putting my gift
in gates' Blazer?

29:34.343 --> 29:35.714
Okay, I'm surprised.

29:35.715 --> 29:38.292
Well, why do you gates have to
wear such similar blazers?

29:38.293 --> 29:39.765
Did you write a note?

29:39.766 --> 29:43.146
Of course I wrote a note.
I'm a writer.

29:43.147 --> 29:45.724
Was it romantic?

29:45.725 --> 29:49.741
It's Valentine's day,
So, yeah, it was romantic.

29:49.742 --> 29:51.249
Did you put my name on it?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.866
Oh, god, Castle, please.
Did you put my name on it?

29:54.867 --> 29:56.237
I can't remember.

29:56.238 --> 29:57.443
I put my name on it.
I know that much.

29:57.444 --> 29:59.351
Oh!

29:59.352 --> 30:00.322
If Gates finds out
that we're dating,

30:00.323 --> 30:01.661
then that's it.

30:01.662 --> 30:03.367
We're not gonna be
working together anymore.

30:03.368 --> 30:04.675
Why do you think I've been
trying so hard to get it back?

30:04.676 --> 30:06.013
Oh, we will get it back,

30:06.014 --> 30:07.518
right when we get
to the precinct.

30:07.519 --> 30:08.927
But right now we got
a murder to solve.

30:08.928 --> 30:10.902
Maybe our last.

30:12.509 --> 30:14.350
Come in.

30:14.351 --> 30:16.459
Thanks for buzzing us in.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.798
What can I do for you?

30:17.799 --> 30:20.811
You know, the interesting thing
about this building

30:20.812 --> 30:24.058
is that the buzzer system
runs through your telephone.

30:24.059 --> 30:25.900
So?

30:25.901 --> 30:28.612
So anytime someone
gets buzzed up,

30:28.613 --> 30:30.588
it gets time stamped.

30:30.589 --> 30:33.869
And since we know you were
at Lorenzo's deli buying onions,

30:33.870 --> 30:35.042
you couldn't have buzzed
Hannah up

30:35.043 --> 30:36.413
the night of the murder.

30:36.414 --> 30:37.583
Which means somebody else did.

30:37.584 --> 30:38.691
Why did you lie to us?

30:38.692 --> 30:40.699
From watching the show,
I know that

30:40.700 --> 30:42.539
your husband is in brussels
working on a deal.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.014
So it couldn't have been him,

30:44.015 --> 30:46.558
which leaves only one other
person living in this house.

30:46.559 --> 30:48.734
Your son stone.

30:48.735 --> 30:50.608
He worked with Hannah,
didn't he?

30:50.609 --> 30:52.451
I don't like
what you're implying.

30:52.452 --> 30:54.458
Were they having problems
with each other?

30:54.459 --> 30:56.870
Where is stone right now,
Ms. Gower?

30:56.871 --> 30:58.811
I don't know.
He's an adult.

30:58.812 --> 31:00.820
Really? Because in
season three, episode five,

31:00.821 --> 31:02.662
you said that you are
your son's keeper,

31:02.663 --> 31:06.076
always knowing where he is
and what he's doing.

31:06.077 --> 31:07.819
Looks like one of us
did their homework.

31:07.820 --> 31:10.529
Now, Ms. Gower,
where is stone?

31:10.530 --> 31:12.840
I would like
to talk to my attorney.

31:12.841 --> 31:15.551
Entertainment or criminal?

31:15.552 --> 31:17.191
Yeah.
Sir, we got him.

31:17.192 --> 31:18.598
Where's he headed?

31:18.599 --> 31:19.837
Stone bought a one-Way ticket
to buenos aires.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.644
Flight departs in an hour.

31:21.645 --> 31:23.653
Bob and Penelope
fake their breakup,

31:23.654 --> 31:27.604
and now poor Sweet innocent
stone's a killer?

31:27.605 --> 31:29.680
Is there anything real
on that reality show?

31:29.681 --> 31:31.622
Just the headache I get
when I watch it.

31:31.623 --> 31:32.961
Call T.S.A.

31:32.962 --> 31:35.306
Do not let him
get on that flight.

31:49.701 --> 31:52.882
Oh, my... God.

32:13.123 --> 32:14.879
Why the sudden trip
to Argentina, Stone?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.819
I just needed
a little time away.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.644
We know that Hannah
showed up at your apartment

32:19.645 --> 32:20.917
the night that she was killed,

32:20.918 --> 32:22.891
and we know
that you let her in.

32:22.892 --> 32:24.229
And then for some reason,

32:24.230 --> 32:25.246
your mother lied about it.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.418
Now why would she do that?

32:26.419 --> 32:27.790
Was it because Hannah told you

32:27.791 --> 32:28.962
that she was gonna
blow up the show

32:28.963 --> 32:30.237
and you
suddenly saw your dreams

32:30.238 --> 32:33.048
of an Ashley/Stone spin-off
going out the window?

32:33.049 --> 32:35.759
Is that why your mom lied?

32:35.760 --> 32:37.098
'cause you followed Hannah
out of the apartment

32:37.099 --> 32:38.305
and you killed her?

32:38.306 --> 32:39.979
I didn't kill her.

32:39.980 --> 32:42.154
Don't you guys get it?

32:42.155 --> 32:44.519
I was in love with her.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.694
Whoa. Love?

32:46.695 --> 32:47.834
What about Ashley?

32:47.835 --> 32:49.574
That was my mom's idea.

32:49.575 --> 32:51.014
Look, I like Ash.

32:51.015 --> 32:53.023
We've known each other
since we were kids.

32:53.024 --> 32:55.098
But...

32:55.099 --> 32:57.609
then I met Hannah.

32:57.610 --> 33:00.120
We bonded over being forced
into things

33:00.121 --> 33:02.832
that weren't really us.

33:02.833 --> 33:04.608
Did anyone else know
about the two of you?

33:04.609 --> 33:05.778
No.

33:05.779 --> 33:07.653
There's too much at stake.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.595
For the past few weeks,

33:09.596 --> 33:11.604
Hannah just couldn't
take it anymore,

33:11.605 --> 33:14.952
what the show
was doing to her, her family.

33:14.953 --> 33:17.128
She was looking for a way out.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.003
We both were.

33:19.004 --> 33:21.580
But the lies had just...

33:21.581 --> 33:23.589
Gotten so big--

33:23.590 --> 33:26.000
Her fake affair, my engagement.

33:26.001 --> 33:28.243
Ash and my mom...

33:28.244 --> 33:32.227
they were counting on
that spin-Off.

33:32.228 --> 33:34.504
What happened the night
that Hannah showed up?

33:34.505 --> 33:36.481
She was hysterical.

33:37.854 --> 33:40.598
She said she wanted
to leave town right away,

33:40.599 --> 33:42.640
that it was now or never.

33:42.641 --> 33:45.720
And I was going to, but...

33:45.721 --> 33:47.094
but what?

33:49.973 --> 33:51.747
Then my mom came home.

33:51.748 --> 33:54.693
When she found out
about our relationship,

33:54.694 --> 33:55.866
she went crazy.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.840
She threw Hannah out.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.748
But the worst part...

33:59.749 --> 34:03.096
was that Hannah begged me

34:03.097 --> 34:04.704
to go with her.

34:06.713 --> 34:08.051
But I couldn't.

34:08.052 --> 34:11.197
In the moment
when she needed me

34:11.199 --> 34:15.216
to stand up to my mother...

34:15.217 --> 34:16.722
I couldn't.

34:16.723 --> 34:19.400
Stone...

34:19.402 --> 34:21.679
did your mother go after her?

34:23.319 --> 34:25.161
No.

34:26.734 --> 34:28.976
As soon as Hannah left,

34:28.978 --> 34:30.717
I knew I'd made a mistake.

34:30.717 --> 34:36.442
So I ran out to catch up
with her in the street.

34:36.443 --> 34:37.915
And I kissed her.

34:37.916 --> 34:40.226
And I told her I loved her.

34:40.226 --> 34:43.206
But she said it was too late...

34:45.750 --> 34:48.797
that she never wanted
to see any of us again.

34:48.797 --> 34:51.475
Can anyone verify
your whereabouts

34:51.476 --> 34:54.856
after you and Hannah
went your separate ways?

34:54.857 --> 34:56.931
I took a long walk,

34:56.933 --> 34:59.779
so, no.

35:01.553 --> 35:03.426
So what do you think?
You believe him?

35:03.427 --> 35:05.035
He had motive.
She was leaving him.

35:05.036 --> 35:07.913
And he was the last one
to see her alive

35:07.914 --> 35:10.458
a block away from where
she was killed, so...

35:10.459 --> 35:12.132
only problem is,

35:12.133 --> 35:13.973
we don't have any proof.

35:13.974 --> 35:15.313
We can't tie stone
to the crime scene.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.820
Actually, we can.

35:16.821 --> 35:18.827
On a hunch, I took a look
at his wedding registry.

35:18.828 --> 35:20.970
It turns out that Ashley
and stone are registered

35:20.971 --> 35:22.845
for a set
of takahara V.g. Knives,

35:22.846 --> 35:24.320
including the 240 millimeter,

35:24.321 --> 35:26.361
which shipped out
three weeks ago.

35:26.362 --> 35:28.336
The lab report did say
that it was a new knife.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.510
Then that seals it.

35:29.511 --> 35:32.287
No, not necessarily.

35:32.288 --> 35:34.096
We're forgetting
wedding etiquette.

35:34.097 --> 35:36.909
The gifts don't go
to the groom.

35:40.156 --> 35:41.495
Thank you for coming, Ashley.

35:41.496 --> 35:43.335
Oh, anything I can do to help.

35:43.336 --> 35:46.148
You must be so busy planning
for the wedding right now

35:46.149 --> 35:48.023
and dealing
with all of the gifts.

35:48.024 --> 35:50.199
Oh, yeah.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.312
Well, we know that your cousin

35:53.313 --> 35:55.957
bought you that set
of Takahara V.G. Knives,

35:55.958 --> 35:58.066
the ones that you have
on your registry.

35:58.067 --> 36:00.410
Okay.

36:00.411 --> 36:01.750
The funny thing is,

36:01.751 --> 36:03.758
when we went to your apartment,

36:03.759 --> 36:07.106
you don't have
the 240 millimeter.

36:07.107 --> 36:08.444
And isn't just a little weird

36:08.445 --> 36:10.054
that she wouldn't get you
the whole set?

36:10.055 --> 36:11.760
You were in my apartment?

36:11.761 --> 36:14.136
Yeah, we also went to
your ceramic studio as well.

36:14.137 --> 36:16.080
Ah, your work
is lovely, by the way.

36:16.081 --> 36:18.657
The colors of your glazes
are stunning.

36:18.658 --> 36:20.666
I mean, it must take a lot
of work to get--

36:20.667 --> 36:22.808
to get them just right,
a lot of chemicals.

36:22.809 --> 36:24.483
Like the, um,

36:24.484 --> 36:26.391
antimony oxide we found,
for example.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.232
What is that for?

36:28.233 --> 36:31.714
It's an opacifier.
It makes things opaque.

36:31.715 --> 36:34.727
Only in this case,
it seems to make things clear.

36:34.728 --> 36:37.338
The knife that was used
in Hannah's murder,

36:37.339 --> 36:40.586
we found traces
of antimony oxide on it

36:40.587 --> 36:41.858
from you.

36:41.859 --> 36:43.700
No.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.307
You got an alert on your phone

36:45.308 --> 36:46.747
from the fan site, didn't you?

36:46.748 --> 36:49.391
That photo of Hannah
at stone's apartment--

36:49.392 --> 36:50.729
I mean, you already had
your suspicions.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.305
You just confirmed
your worst fears.

36:52.306 --> 36:53.643
No. No.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.652
I think we're done here.
I'm gonna go.

36:55.653 --> 36:56.825
Excuse me.

36:58.298 --> 37:00.607
Excuse me. I've just--
Let me find my keys

37:00.608 --> 37:01.914
and I will go.

37:04.726 --> 37:06.735
FINE!

37:08.309 --> 37:10.283
I had my suspicions.

37:10.284 --> 37:13.330
And when I saw that picture,
I grabbed the knife,

37:13.331 --> 37:14.936
just to scare her.

37:14.937 --> 37:16.945
But when I got there,
stone was kissing her

37:16.946 --> 37:18.954
and saying he loved her.

37:18.955 --> 37:21.967
I couldn't just let her
steal my fiance.

37:21.968 --> 37:24.545
Our spin-off
was in final negotiations,

37:24.546 --> 37:25.818
for god sakes.

37:30.907 --> 37:32.480
So...

37:32.481 --> 37:35.360
When Stone left,

37:35.361 --> 37:36.933
I followed Hannah.

37:36.934 --> 37:41.085
I put an end to the threat.

37:41.086 --> 37:42.993
The next generation of
"The Wives of Wall Street,"

37:42.994 --> 37:46.073
and Ashley takes it
to a whole new level.

37:46.074 --> 37:47.746
Well, maybe she was just
following their motto--

37:47.747 --> 37:49.922
"don't let anyone stop you
from getting what you want."

37:49.923 --> 37:51.130
As if being on tv

37:51.131 --> 37:54.644
somehow made her immune
to the consequences.

37:54.645 --> 37:58.394
You know, at least we can
tell Hannah's family

37:58.395 --> 38:00.537
that the affair wasn't real,

38:00.538 --> 38:02.747
that she was actually
planning on going home.
Mm-hmm.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.893
Speaking of consequences...

38:05.894 --> 38:08.572
Why hasn't gates
said anything yet?

38:08.573 --> 38:10.178
Yeah, I don't know.

38:10.179 --> 38:11.786
Maybe
she's choosing to ignore it

38:11.787 --> 38:13.962
or just biding her time

38:13.963 --> 38:15.200
like a shark.

38:15.201 --> 38:16.708
Night, guys.

38:16.709 --> 38:18.046
Happy Valentine's day.

38:18.047 --> 38:19.586
Ah, once more onto the breach?

38:19.587 --> 38:21.494
Uh, actually,
Jenny just texted me,

38:21.495 --> 38:22.900
and I have the night off.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.141
I mean, we'll probably still,

38:24.142 --> 38:25.680
uh, you know,

38:25.681 --> 38:28.024
but tonight it will be
for romantic reasons.

38:28.025 --> 38:30.234
Yeah.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.193
Hey, Espo.

38:36.194 --> 38:39.138
Your date's here.

38:39.139 --> 38:40.713
I knew they had plans.

38:40.714 --> 38:42.218
You knew they had plans
and you didn't tell me?

38:42.219 --> 38:43.191
Yeah, because she asked me

38:43.192 --> 38:44.563
to keep it a secret.

38:44.564 --> 38:45.900
This is a really big deal
for them.

38:45.901 --> 38:47.541
She doesn't want you
making fun of 'em.

38:47.542 --> 38:48.948
I wouldn't make fun--
No, that's...

38:48.949 --> 38:50.891
That's not True.
That'd be fish in a barrel.

38:50.892 --> 38:53.100
Oh.

38:53.101 --> 38:54.875
Lanie...

38:54.876 --> 38:56.247
you look great.

38:56.248 --> 38:58.289
Yeah?
It's not too much?

38:58.290 --> 39:00.934
No. It might be a little
too much for Castle.

39:00.935 --> 39:02.374
Eyes up, bud.
I do.

39:02.375 --> 39:03.747
You look amazing, Lanie.

39:03.748 --> 39:04.920
Thanks, javi.
Mm-hmm.

39:04.921 --> 39:06.257
So what's the plan?

39:06.258 --> 39:08.300
Uh, reservations
at le fourneau.

39:08.301 --> 39:09.806
French?

39:09.807 --> 39:11.380
Mm-hmm.
I love French.

39:11.381 --> 39:13.155
Je le sais, ma petite Jolie.

39:13.156 --> 39:14.629
Ooh.

39:16.102 --> 39:18.244
Au revoir.
Au revoir.

39:18.245 --> 39:21.190
Ah, the magic of Valentine's day
is upon us.

39:21.191 --> 39:22.262
Mr. Castle.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.877
My office, now.

39:25.878 --> 39:28.422
And there it goes.

39:43.355 --> 39:45.161
Did you really think

39:45.162 --> 39:47.036
that I, of all people,

39:47.037 --> 39:48.945
would be okay with this?

39:48.946 --> 39:50.919
No, I...

39:50.920 --> 39:52.896
thought--I...

39:56.780 --> 39:59.223
"You are beauty, passion,

39:59.224 --> 40:01.231
"and fierce intellect.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.079
Be my Valentine.
Rick."

40:06.556 --> 40:09.267
Is that all I wrote in there?

40:09.268 --> 40:10.941
Isn't that enough?

40:10.942 --> 40:12.381
What the hell
is wrong with you?

40:12.382 --> 40:14.376
I'm a married woman.

40:14.377 --> 40:17.624
N--I-I know. No, I know.
I just thought--

40:17.625 --> 40:19.633
Is this some lame,
harebrained scheme

40:19.634 --> 40:21.273
to garner favor with me?

40:21.274 --> 40:23.047
Yeah.

40:23.048 --> 40:24.888
That's--That's what
this is.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.261
Well, it backfired.

40:26.262 --> 40:29.777
And I am willing to forget
that this ever happened

40:29.778 --> 40:33.192
if you assure me that you can
tame your childish nonsense

40:33.193 --> 40:36.272
and accord me some respect.

40:36.273 --> 40:39.353
I-I will. I can. I will.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.939
And now I will go home

40:43.940 --> 40:45.981
to my husband,

40:45.982 --> 40:47.286
because...

40:47.287 --> 40:51.038
I'm his Valentine.

40:52.477 --> 40:54.485
But she already
hated you, Castle.

40:54.486 --> 40:57.264
So it doesn't sound like
you're any worse off.

40:57.265 --> 40:59.273
I do respect the way
she handled it, though--

40:59.274 --> 41:01.282
Strong, decisive.

41:01.283 --> 41:02.955
I feel like somehow,

41:02.956 --> 41:04.529
it brought us closer.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.371
I am sorry about
the earrings, though.

41:06.372 --> 41:09.283
Yeah, me, too.
They were... stunning.

41:09.284 --> 41:12.430
Mm. I will get you
something else

41:12.431 --> 41:13.937
even more beautiful.

41:13.938 --> 41:15.411
I'll just try not to give it
to another woman first.

41:15.412 --> 41:17.252
Oh, that would be nice.

41:17.253 --> 41:19.327
Which reminds me...
hmm?

41:19.328 --> 41:22.007
What did you get me?

41:27.531 --> 41:29.071
Open it.

41:47.485 --> 41:49.560
Maybe it's in another drawer.

41:51.435 --> 41:52.573
It is the drawer.

41:55.252 --> 41:57.462
It's your drawer.

42:00.442 --> 42:02.616
I-I mean, I know it's not
a lightsaber, but--

42:02.617 --> 42:05.563
No.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.271
It's perfect.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.465
Happy Valentine's day.

42:14.604 --> 42:16.477
Now...

42:16.478 --> 42:18.386
Take your clothes off,

42:18.387 --> 42:21.265
put them in your drawer,

42:21.266 --> 42:23.710
and meet me in the bed.

42:38.675 --> 42:40.078
Seriously?
