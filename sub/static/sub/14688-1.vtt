01:45.872 --> 01:48.500
Is there any legal reason why
sentence should not be pronounced?

01:48.608 --> 01:51.702
No, Your Honor.
Yes. I have something to say.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.712
You can put me away. But you can't
put away what's going to happen...

01:54.814 --> 01:57.578
to you and to this
whole country next time.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.982
Next time we are going to
I wouldn't say anymore.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.520
We'll leave that for the appeal.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.649
It is the judgment of this court
that the defendant, John Huberman,

02:06.759 --> 02:10.286
having been found guilty of the crime
of treason against the United States...

02:10.395 --> 02:14.298
by the jury of this court for the
southern district of Florida at Miami,

02:14.400 --> 02:17.801
be committed to the custody
of the United States attorney general...

02:17.904 --> 02:21.271
for imprisonment in an institution
of the penitentiary type...

02:21.374 --> 02:23.842
for a period of 20 years.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.911
And the defendant
may be forthwith remanded...

02:26.012 --> 02:28.276
to the custody
of the United States marshall.

02:28.381 --> 02:30.440
Court is now adjourned.
Here she comes.

02:34.854 --> 02:38.290
Just a minute, Miss Huberman.
Hold it, Miss Huberman.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.883
We'd like a statement from you,
Miss Huberman, about your father.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.463
For instance, do you think
your father got what he deserved?

02:44.564 --> 02:46.930
Could we say you're pleased your
father is going to pay the penalty...

02:47.033 --> 02:49.297
for being a German worker?

02:49.402 --> 02:52.064
Let us know
if she tries to leave town.

Would you care to pause for
some refreshments, Mr. Hop... kins?

03:07.921 --> 03:11.880
Alicia, were you really followed by
a policeman? It sounds very exciting.

03:11.991 --> 03:15.119
I'm going to shoot it out
with them tomorrow.
He's had enough.

03:15.228 --> 03:18.459
So have you.
Don't be silly. The important
drinking hasn't started yet.

03:18.565 --> 03:21.261
Man On Radio Everybody here's
got a stuffed fish hanging on the wall.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.562
Where'd they get it?
Never seen a fish.

03:23.670 --> 03:27.071
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

03:27.173 --> 03:31.041
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I like party crashers.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.636
He's not a party crasher.
I brought him.
Oh.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.716

I wouldn't mind
being followed by a cop.

03:37.817 --> 03:40.911
I hate low, underhanded people
like policemen pussyfooting after you.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.045
Because I'm a marked
woman, you know.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.784
I'm liable to blow up
the Panama Canal any minute now.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.087
Do you want some ice in it?
No, thank you.

03:48.194 --> 03:51.254
It's not becoming for a lovely girl
like you to be worried about policemen.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.423
You won't be tomorrow.
Oh, really?

03:53.533 --> 03:56.229
We sail at 10:00.
Really? We just sail away, huh?

03:56.336 --> 03:58.429
Show me a fish,
and I'll show you a liar.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.938
What this party needs
is a little gland treatment.
No fish.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.066
We'd better start breaking up, Alicia.
I have to be on board at 9:00.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.340
One week in Havana, and this whole thing
about your father will have blown over.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.712
Do you love me, Commodore?
You're a very beautiful woman.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.944
I'll have another drink
to appreciate that.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.020
Where are you going?
Fishing.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.521
This time of night?
How about you? Still drinking?

04:17.624 --> 04:20.889
What's the difference?
You know something? I like you.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.360
Well, I'll see you
on board, Alicia, 9:00.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.624
Oh, I'll
have to think that over.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.599
You don't have to pack.
We can pick up some things in Havana.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.226
I think I'll have to leave him
here to dry out a little.

04:31.337 --> 04:35.239
I'm very sorry you all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.605
Good night.
Good night.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.769
Good night, dear.
Good night.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.027
There's one more drink
left apiece.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.756
Shame about the ice.
What is?

04:57.864 --> 05:00.355
Gone.
Who's gone?

05:00.466 --> 05:04.596
The ice.
Why do you like that song?

05:04.704 --> 05:08.140
Giggling

05:10.777 --> 05:13.371
Because it's a lot of hooey.

05:15.748 --> 05:19.707
There's nothing like a love song
to give you a good laugh.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.719
That's right.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.455
It's stuffy in here, isn't it?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.460
Might be.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.462
What about...

05:33.533 --> 05:35.433
we have a picnic?

05:37.136 --> 05:39.104
Outside?

05:43.509 --> 05:46.637
It's too stuffy
in here for a picnic.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.278
Wanna finish that?
Shame to leave it.

Giggling

06:20.847 --> 06:23.338
What about your guests?

06:23.449 --> 06:26.111
They'll crawl out
under their own steam.

06:26.219 --> 06:31.555
I'm going to drive.
That's understood.

06:37.196 --> 06:40.996
Don't you need a coat?
You'll do.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.375
Wait a minute. Let me put this on you.
You might catch cold.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.230
How am I doing?
Not bad.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.342
Scared?
No.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.207
Oh, no, you're not scared
of anything, are you?

07:26.312 --> 07:28.678
Not too much.

07:32.685 --> 07:36.451
This fog gets me.
That's your hair in your eyes.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.490
Oh.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.455
What does the speedometer say?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.866
Sixty-five.

07:54.006 --> 07:58.067
I'm gonna make it 80
and wipe that grin off your face.

07:58.177 --> 08:02.079
I don't like gentlemen
who grin at me.

is chasing us. Look.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.862
Oh, they make me sick.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.405
He wants to talk to you.

08:31.410 --> 08:36.073
Drunken driving. My second offense.
Now I go to jail.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.379
Whole family in jail.
Who cares?

Havin' a time to yourself,
aren't you?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.634

ought to be in bed.

Just a minute, officer.

09:00.072 --> 09:03.007
No arguments, mister.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.809
Sorry, but you didn't speak up.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.945
That's all right.
Sure you can handle her?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.114
No trouble.
Well, you oughta know.

Devlin.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.639
When you showed that cop
something, he saluted you.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.510
Did he?
I saw him.

09:43.616 --> 09:47.848
Why, you double-crossing buzzard!
You're a cop!

09:47.954 --> 09:50.149
All right, we'll argue later.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.554
Get away from my car!
Get out of my car!

09:52.658 --> 09:55.456
I'm gonna take you home.
You're not gonna take me home at all!

09:55.561 --> 09:58.257
Ooh!
Move over.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.592
Come on.
Ow!

to get something on me.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.511
About last night.
Just wanted to be friends.

12:27.613 --> 12:30.844
Friends, yeah.
So you could frame me, hmm?

I am no stool pigeon,
Mr. Devlin.

12:52.738 --> 12:56.674
My department authorized me
to engage you to do some work for us.
It's a job in Brazil.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.404
Oh, go away.
The whole thing bores me.

12:59.512 --> 13:03.608
Some of the German gentry who were
paying your father are working in Rio.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.809
Ever hear of
the I.G. Farben Industries?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.545
I tell you,
I'm not interested.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.850
Farben has men in South America,
planted there before the war.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.187
We're cooperating with the Brazilian
government to smoke them out.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.592
My chief thinks
that the daughter of a
Of a traitor?

13:17.696 --> 13:20.164
Well, he thinks you might
be valuable in the work.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.234
They might sort of trust you.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.734
And you could make up a little
for your daddy's peculiarities.

13:24.837 --> 13:27.670
Why should I?
Patriotism.

13:27.773 --> 13:30.571
That word gives me a pain.
No, thank you.

13:30.676 --> 13:34.874
I don't go for patriotism...
or patriots.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.948
I'd like to dispute that with you.

Waving the flag with one hand
and picking pockets with the other.

13:40.119 --> 13:43.520
That's your patriotism.
Well, you can have it.

wired for three months.

and daughter Alicia,

at Miami Beach, Florida. "

13:53.165 --> 13:55.827
Some of the evidence
that wasn't used at the trial.

13:55.935 --> 13:59.632
I don't want to hear that.
Relax, hardboiled, and listen.

I wouldn't do it.

You don't use your judgment.
You can have anything you want.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.709
The work is easy.
Alicia I'll not listen, Father.

14:11.817 --> 14:14.217
Huberman
This is not your country, is it?

14:14.320 --> 14:17.551
Alicia My mother was born here.
We have American citizenship.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.750
Huberman Where is your judgment?
In your feelings, you are German.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.556
You've got to listen to me.
You don't know what we stand for.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.291
Alicia I know what you stand for!
You and your murdering swine.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.663
I've hated you
ever since I found out.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.827
Huberman My daughter,
don't talk to me like that.

14:31.937 --> 14:34.667
Alicia
Stay on your side of the table!
Alicia, put your voice down.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.867
Alicia I hate you all.
And I love this country.

14:37.977 --> 14:41.208
Do you understand that?
I love it.

14:41.313 --> 14:45.374
I'll see you all hanged before
I'll raise a finger against it.

14:45.484 --> 14:50.319
Now, go on and get out of here,
or so help me, I'll turn you in.

14:50.422 --> 14:54.984
Don't ever come near me or speak to me
again about your rotten schemes.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.654
Record Stops

15:00.132 --> 15:05.001
Well, that doesn't prove much.
I didn't turn him in.

15:05.104 --> 15:09.666
We didn't expect you to.
Well, what do you say?

15:11.543 --> 15:15.673
Scoffs
Go away and leave me alone.

15:15.781 --> 15:19.717
I have my own life to lead.
Good times.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.343
That's what I want.
And laughs with people I like.

Doorbell Buzzing
And no underhanded cops who want
to put me in a shooting gallery.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.886
Knocking At Door
But people of my own kind...

15:29.995 --> 15:32.327
who'll treat me right
and like me and understand me.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.491
Door Opens
Good morning, Alicia.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.502
Oh, hello.
Thought you might
need a hand this morning.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.370
We're sailing with the tide,
you know. Are you ready?
Yes.

15:42.474 --> 15:45.875
Don't tell me you've
forgotten, my dear.
Almost.

15:45.978 --> 15:49.038
I'll help you pack, although
you really don't need anything.
We've got everything on board.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.241
Oh, thank you.
I'll pack myself. I

15:51.350 --> 15:54.148
We're moored at the hotel pier.
You know the spot.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.517
Yes.
You're a darling.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.752
Sweetest girl I ever knew.
See you soon.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.157
Door Closes

16:03.262 --> 16:06.163
Well, what about it?
Plane leaves tomorrow morning, early.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.966
All right.
You better tell him.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.569
Quiet Chattering

16:53.746 --> 16:55.646
Hmm. I'll tell her.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.648
See you later.

17:05.624 --> 17:08.058
He's a very nice-looking man.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.025
You'll be seeing him in Rio.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.121
Oh, no, no.
I won't be seeing any men in Rio.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.598
Oh, yes, you will.
That's our boss, Paul Prescott.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.372
Did he say anything about the job?

17:22.473 --> 17:24.704
No.
No hints?

17:24.810 --> 17:29.338
No. But he had some news about your
father he picked up at the last stop.

17:29.448 --> 17:32.008
What about him?
He died this morning.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.957
Oh. How?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.223
Poison capsule.
He did it himself?

17:44.329 --> 17:48.163
Yes, in his cell. Sorry.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.438
I don't know
why I should feel so bad.

17:55.107 --> 17:59.703
When he told me a few years ago
what he was, everything went to pot.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.178
I didn't care
what happened to me.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.148
But now I remember
how nice he once was.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.377
How nice we both were.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.317
Very nice.

18:09.421 --> 18:13.084
It's a very curious feeling,

18:13.192 --> 18:17.856
as if something had happened
to me and not to him.

18:17.963 --> 18:20.955
You see, I don't
have to hate him anymore.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.966
Or myself.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.536
We're coming into Rio.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.465
Alicia
Oh, yes. So we are.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.260
Latin

18:54.900 --> 18:57.733
I wonder if the embassy
someone can get me a maid.

18:57.836 --> 19:01.237
It's a nice apartment, and I don't mind
dusting and sweeping but I hate cooking.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.240
I'll ask them.
And while you're at it,

19:03.342 --> 19:05.902
find out when I go to work,
and on what.
Yes, ma'am.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.605
Waiter Speaking Portuguese
Have another drink?

19:08.714 --> 19:12.150
No, thank you. I've had enough.
Oh. Whiskey and soda.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.879
Well, do you hear that?

19:14.987 --> 19:17.979
I'm practically on the wagon.
That's quite a change.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.821
It's a phase.
You don't think a woman can change?

19:21.927 --> 19:25.522
Sure. But change is fun...
for a while.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.533
For a while.
What a rat you are, Devlin.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.627
All right. You've been
sober for eight days.

19:32.738 --> 19:36.037
As far as I know,
you've made no new conquests.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.041
Well, that's something.

19:38.143 --> 19:41.408
Eight days.
Practically whitewashed.

19:41.513 --> 19:46.712
I'm very happy, Dev.
Why won't you let me be happy?

19:46.818 --> 19:49.514
Nobody's stopping you.

19:52.224 --> 19:57.127
Why don't you give that
copper's brain of yours a rest?

19:57.229 --> 20:00.221
Every time you look at me,
I can see it dwelling over its slogans:

20:00.332 --> 20:04.291
"Once a crook, always a crook.
Once a tramp, always a tramp. "

20:06.338 --> 20:08.568
Go on. You can hold my hand.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.972
I won't blackmail you
for it afterwards.

20:11.076 --> 20:12.976
Scared?

20:13.078 --> 20:16.411
I've always been scared
of women, but I get over it.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.710
And now you're scared of yourself.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.910
You're afraid you'll
fall in love with me.

20:21.019 --> 20:24.386
That wouldn't be hard.
Ooh, now, careful, careful.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.616
You enjoy making fun
of me, don't you?

20:30.095 --> 20:32.256
No, Dev.
I'm making fun of myself.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.764
I'm pretending I'm a nice,
unspoiled child...

20:34.866 --> 20:37.334
whose heart is full
of daisies and buttercups.

20:37.436 --> 20:40.064
Nice daydream. Than what?

20:42.941 --> 20:44.966
Waiter, Indistinct

20:45.077 --> 20:48.103
I think I will have another drink.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.181
I thought you'd get around to it.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.182
Make it a double.

20:52.284 --> 20:55.151
Devlin Orders In Portuguese

20:57.522 --> 21:00.616
Why won't you believe in me, Dev?

21:02.027 --> 21:03.927
Just a little.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.632
Why won't you?

21:21.146 --> 21:24.047
I know why you won't, Dev.
You're sore.

21:24.149 --> 21:27.050
You're sore because you've
fallen for a little drunk...

21:27.152 --> 21:29.746
you tailed in Miami,
and you don't like it.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.982
Makes you sick all over,
doesn't it?

21:32.090 --> 21:35.059
People will laugh at you, the invincible
Devlin in love with someone...

21:35.160 --> 21:37.424
who isn't worth
even wasting the words on.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.090
Poor Dev, in love with a no-good gal.
It must be awful. I'm sorry

21:42.934 --> 21:45.232
Car Horns Honking

21:45.337 --> 21:48.306
Gentlemen, I assure you
she's a perfect type for the job.

21:48.407 --> 21:51.706
It's not the girl. It's this
German scientist I'm worried about.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.644
I simply question why we don't find
some way of taking them into custody.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.773
It'd do no good. Even if we arrested
their leader Alexander Sebastian,

21:58.884 --> 22:01.751
tomorrow another Farben man
takes his place and their work goes on.

22:01.853 --> 22:06.290
Yes, you're right. I see, Captain
Prescott, your method is the best way.

22:06.391 --> 22:09.224
Well, she's good at making
friends with gentlemen,

22:09.328 --> 22:12.058
and we want somebody inside
his house, in his confidence.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.394
You have faith in this procedure,
Captain Prescott?

22:14.499 --> 22:16.399
Oh, yes.
With somebody on the inside

22:16.501 --> 22:18.594
Have you consulted the young lady?
No, not yet.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.935
As a matter of fact, our man Devlin just
brought here down here the other day.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.406
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.909
Has your Mr. Devlin told her
the nature of the work?

22:27.012 --> 22:30.880
No, we haven't discussed it
with him at all. But I can set
your mind at rest about her.

22:30.982 --> 22:34.076
You're sure of her political side?
Oh, oh, yes.

22:34.186 --> 22:38.418
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.856
Now, that's fine. I'll give Devlin
his instructions right away.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.752
It's nice out here.

23:43.855 --> 23:47.951
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.254
We have to eat.

23:50.362 --> 23:54.093
We can eat here.
I'll cook.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.259
I thought you didn't
like to cook.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.929
No, I don't like to cook.

24:01.706 --> 24:04.971
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.442
What about all the washing up
afterward?

24:07.546 --> 24:09.844
We'll eat it with our fingers.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.882
Don't we need any plates?

24:11.983 --> 24:15.350
Yes. One for you and one for me.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.784
Mind if I have dinner
with you tonight?

24:21.893 --> 24:24.418
I'd be delighted.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.259
Where are you going?
Well, if we're going to stay in,

24:27.365 --> 24:30.425
I have to telephone the hotel,
see if there are any messages.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.504
You have to?
I have to.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.645
Dialing Phone

24:45.750 --> 24:48.913
This is a very strange
love affair.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.181
Why?

24:51.289 --> 24:54.554
Maybe the fact
that you don't love me.

24:55.794 --> 24:59.924
Hello? Palace Hotel?
Parle Anglais?

25:00.031 --> 25:03.694
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?

25:03.802 --> 25:06.669
When I don't love you,
I'll let you know.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.705
You haven't said anything.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.571
Actions speak louder than words.
Chuckling

25:11.676 --> 25:14.668
There is? Good.
Read it to me, please.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.257
Prescott wants me over
right away.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.123
Did he say what about?
No.

25:30.228 --> 25:33.026
Maybe it's our assignment.
Probably.

25:41.673 --> 25:43.903
Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?

25:44.009 --> 25:48.912
Yes. What about a nice bottle of wine?
We'll celebrate.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.539
What time shall I come back?

25:51.650 --> 25:53.641
Seven o'clock.

25:57.522 --> 25:59.854
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.540
Prescott What is it, Devlin?
What's the matter?

26:20.645 --> 26:22.875
I don't know if she'll do it.
What do you mean,
you don't think she'd

26:22.981 --> 26:26.109
You haven't discussed it
with her, have you?
I didn't know what the job was.

26:26.217 --> 26:28.378
Well, what do you mean,
she wouldn't do it?

26:28.486 --> 26:31.751
Well, I don't think she's that type
of woman. She strikes me as being

26:31.856 --> 26:33.881
I don't understand your attitude.

26:33.992 --> 26:37.325
Why do you think she won't do it?
Well, she's had no experience.

26:37.429 --> 26:41.195
Oh, come now. What experience
does she lack, do you think?

26:41.299 --> 26:44.268
She's never been trained for that
kind of work. They'll see through her.

26:44.369 --> 26:46.894
Miss Huberman was chosen
not only because her father...

26:47.005 --> 26:49.599
gives her an ideal background,
but because Sebastian knows her.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.975
Oh, yes. He was once
in love with her.

26:56.414 --> 26:58.314
Oh, I didn't know that.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.941
I don't see why we're arguing
about petty things like this.

27:01.052 --> 27:03.953
We've got important work to do.
Sebastian's house is a cover-up...

27:04.055 --> 27:06.353
for whatever this Farben
group's up to here in Rio.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.451
We've got to get Miss Huberman
inside that house and find out
what's going on there.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.998
So I think you'd better go back
to Miss Huberman and explain
to her what she has to do.

27:14.099 --> 27:16.363
I, uh
Well, what is it?

27:16.468 --> 27:19.995
Nothing, sir.
Oh, I thought you were
going to say something.

27:20.105 --> 27:23.336
How is the meeting to be arranged?
Oh, well, we've discussed that.

27:23.441 --> 27:26.239
I think the riding club
would be the best place.

27:26.344 --> 27:29.211
Sebastian usually
rides there in the mornings.

27:29.314 --> 27:32.977
So the rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.

27:33.084 --> 27:36.850
Okay, Devlin, that's all.
All right.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.694
Door Closes

27:49.167 --> 27:51.897
Alicia Dev, is that you?
Uh-huh.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.439
I'm glad you're late. This chicken
took longer than I expected.

27:55.540 --> 27:59.442
What did they say?
Hope it isn't done too much.

27:59.544 --> 28:01.842
It caught fire once.

28:01.946 --> 28:05.143
I think it's better
if I cut it up out here.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.310
Unless you want a half a one
to yourself. Chuckles

28:08.420 --> 28:10.980
We're going to have
knives and forks after all.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.284
I've decided we're
going to eat in style.

28:13.391 --> 28:17.760
Marriage must be wonderful with this
sort of thing going on every day.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.464
I wonder if it's too cold out here.
Maybe we should eat inside.

28:28.339 --> 28:31.069
Hasn't something like this
happened before?

28:34.145 --> 28:36.875
What's the matter?

28:36.981 --> 28:39.882
Don't look so tense.
Troubles?

28:41.486 --> 28:44.353
Well, handsome, I think you'd better
tell mama what's going on.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.721
All this secrecy's going
to ruin my little dinner.

28:47.826 --> 28:51.592
Come on, Mr. D.,
what is darkening your brow?

28:51.696 --> 28:54.494
After dinner.
No, now.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.702
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
The time has come...

28:58.803 --> 29:02.000
when you must tell me that you have
a wife and two adorable children...

29:02.107 --> 29:05.304
and this madness between us
can't go on any longer.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.243
I'll bet you've heard
that line often enough.

29:11.182 --> 29:16.745
Right below the belt every time.
Oh, that isn't fair, Dev.

29:16.855 --> 29:21.087
Skip it. We have other things
to talk about. We've got a job.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.527
Oh. So there is a job.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.594
You, uh You remember
a man named Sebastian?

29:31.736 --> 29:34.330
Alex Sebastian?
Yes.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.532
One of my father's friends, yes.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.876
He had quite a crush on you.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.946
I wasn't very responsive.

29:44.315 --> 29:47.182
Well, he's here. The head
of a large German business concern.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.378
His family always had money.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.786
He's part of the combine that
built up the German war machine
and hopes to keep on going.

29:52.891 --> 29:56.292
Something big?
It has all the earmarks
of being something big.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.521
We have to contact him.

30:15.046 --> 30:17.207
Go on.
Let's have all of it.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.910
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.783
You've got to work on him
and land him.

30:23.888 --> 30:28.086
Mata Hari.
She makes love for the papers.

30:28.193 --> 30:31.287
There are no papers.
You land him.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.830
Find out what's going on
inside his house,

30:33.932 --> 30:36.924
what the group around him
is up to, and report to us.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.436
I suppose you knew about this pretty
little job of mine all the time.

30:42.540 --> 30:46.340
No. I only just
found out about it.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.314
Did you say anything?

30:50.415 --> 30:54.112
I mean, that maybe I wasn't
the girl for such shenanigans?

30:56.221 --> 30:58.382
I figured that was up to you.

30:58.489 --> 31:00.923
If you'd care to back out
I suppose you told them,

31:01.025 --> 31:04.051
"Alicia Huberman will have this
Sebastian eating out of her
hand in a couple of weeks.

31:04.162 --> 31:07.359
She's good at that. Always was. "
I didn't say anything.

31:10.168 --> 31:15.196
Not a word for that little
lovesick lady you left an hour ago?

31:16.941 --> 31:18.966
I told you,
that's the assignment.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.910
Oh, well, now,
don't get sore, Dev.

31:23.514 --> 31:27.951
I'm only fishing for
a little bird call from my dream man.

31:29.787 --> 31:31.914
One little remark such as,

31:32.023 --> 31:35.424
"How dare you gentlemen
suggest that Alicia Huberman

31:35.526 --> 31:39.462
the new Miss Huberman
be submitted to so ugly a fate?"

31:39.564 --> 31:41.930
That's not funny.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.431
Do you want me to take the job?

31:49.540 --> 31:52.907
You're answering for yourself.
I am asking you.

31:53.011 --> 31:55.002
It's up to you.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.447
Not a peep, hmm?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.854
Oh, darling, what you didn't
tell them, tell me

32:03.955 --> 32:07.789
that you believe I'm nice and that
I love you and I'll never change back.

32:09.994 --> 32:12.155
I'm waiting for your answer.

32:17.302 --> 32:19.463
What a little pal you are.

32:22.540 --> 32:26.101
Never believing me, hmm?
Not a word of faith.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.805
Just down the drain with Alicia.
That's where she belongs.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.817
Oh, Dev, Dev.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.521
When do I go to work
for Uncle Sam?

32:47.632 --> 32:49.623
Tomorrow morning.

33:01.112 --> 33:05.378
Oh, we shouldn't have had this out here.
It's all cold now.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.776
What are you looking for?

33:08.886 --> 33:11.878
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.900
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.564
As Devlin?
Yes. Public relations office.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.732
Anything else?

33:30.842 --> 33:33.538
No, except we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.737
Less detail, the better.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.120
Are you sure that's him?
Yes.

33:50.228 --> 33:52.856
We'll go by him easy,
let him spot you. Come on.

34:22.659 --> 34:25.150
I guess I'm the girl
nobody remembers.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.231
Was it Sebastian?
Yes.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.891
We'll stick around,
give him another chance.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.581
Bell Ringing

34:58.629 --> 35:01.530
Orchestral

35:16.647 --> 35:19.548
My dear Alicia, will you
forgive me for being late?

35:19.650 --> 35:22.551
Last minute conference at the office.
You got my message?

35:22.653 --> 35:25.383
Yes. It's all right, Alex.
Sweet of you to wait.

35:25.490 --> 35:28.653
I was afraid you might run on.
Oh, I'm not that easily put off.

35:28.759 --> 35:31.057
I was too anxious
to meet you again.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.255
You know, I'm tired.

35:33.364 --> 35:36.856
The worst thing about business
is it makes you feel old and look old.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.732
You seem to have escaped
all of that.

35:39.837 --> 35:42.567
Four years of dullness
and disintegration. Awful.

35:42.673 --> 35:45.233
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.

35:45.343 --> 35:48.870
Well, it's a temporary improvement,
entirely due to your presence, my dear.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.448
You always affected me like a tonic.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.074
Perhaps now
with you here in Rio

35:54.185 --> 35:57.086
unless you insist
on running away from me again

35:57.188 --> 35:59.713
Oh, uh, would you like
another drink?

35:59.824 --> 36:02.725
Yes. Thank you.
Deux martinis.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.125
You know him?

36:11.235 --> 36:13.863
No, I don't think so.
But he seems familiar.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.871
Captain Prescott,
intelligence man.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.998
He's down here as part
of a Washington espionage.

36:18.109 --> 36:21.374
The American embassy
is loaded with them.
Really?

36:22.880 --> 36:25.007
Hey, he's rather
handsome, isn't he?

36:25.116 --> 36:27.584
I'm allergic
to American agents.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.586
Their fine points don't
particularly appeal to me.

36:30.688 --> 36:33.350
Have the bothered you
since you came down?

36:33.457 --> 36:35.516
No. No, not yet.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.729
They were troublesome in Miami?

36:38.829 --> 36:41.821
Yes. That's why I left
right after the trial,

36:41.933 --> 36:43.958
to get away from their snooping.

36:44.068 --> 36:47.299
I wondered why
you left your father.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.467
He insisted.
He was so unselfish.

36:51.576 --> 36:54.943
He kept worrying about me,
begging me to leave.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.640
I had no idea
he was going to die.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.182
Many things have died
for all of us.

37:00.284 --> 37:03.845
We mustn't let our spirit
die with them.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.220
Perhaps I can help you
to forget. I'd like to.

37:08.659 --> 37:11.924
It's odd...

37:12.029 --> 37:14.589
but I feel at home with you.

37:14.699 --> 37:19.602
You know, my dear,
I knew this was going to happen.

37:19.704 --> 37:23.834
I knew when we met the other day
that if I saw you again,

37:23.941 --> 37:26.501
I'd feel what I used to for you.

37:26.611 --> 37:29.375
The same hunger.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.914
You're so lovely, my dear.

37:32.016 --> 37:35.452
Oh, now I'm going
to make a fool of myself again.

37:35.553 --> 37:38.488
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?

37:38.589 --> 37:41.319
That Mr. Devlin you were with?

37:41.425 --> 37:43.393
There is no one.

37:43.494 --> 37:45.394
He seemed attentive.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.499
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his
attentiveness ever since I arrived.

37:50.601 --> 37:54.002
I met him on the plane from Miami.
You made a pretty couple.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.905
Oh, Alex, Mr. Devlin
doesn't interest me.

37:59.644 --> 38:04.274
I was so lonely that day, I could
have gone riding with Peter Rabbit.

38:04.382 --> 38:07.476
You'll let me help
your loneliness?

38:10.121 --> 38:14.080
You are very sweet to forget
what a brat I was... once.

38:14.191 --> 38:18.651
My dear, I shall test out
your repentance at once.

38:18.763 --> 38:21.857
Will you have dinner with me
again tomorrow night?

38:21.966 --> 38:24.196
Thank you very much.
My house?

38:26.637 --> 38:29.538
Yes, how nice.
My mother is giving a dinner party.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.699
She won't mind an extra guest?

38:31.809 --> 38:34.835
An old friend
is never an extra guest.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.881
Well, shall we order now?

38:38.983 --> 38:42.146
Yes, yes. I'm starved.
Garcon.

38:42.253 --> 38:46.713
Now, let's see, what shall we
what shall we have for our first
dinner together?

38:55.766 --> 38:57.666
Door Opens

39:00.905 --> 39:03.999
Good evening.
Very good.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.235
Yes, yes, isn't it?

39:06.344 --> 39:09.370
Oh, I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.505
Oh. All right.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.548
Would you help me,
please? I

39:15.653 --> 39:18.053
Why-Why, yes, certainly.
Thank you.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.555
So, uh, the old boy knew me, eh?

39:20.658 --> 39:22.853
Yes. He thought
you were very handsome.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.690
Oh, you don't say?
Sorry I'm not going with you.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.855
Oh, Dev'll pick those up later.
All right.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.866
Now, try to memorize the names
of all the people you see there tonight.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.869
The men, I mean. And get their
nationalities. That's very important.

39:33.971 --> 39:36.405
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.704
And I suggest that you don't ask any
questions. Just use your eyes and ears.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.973
They're a pretty keen and desperate
bunch. Don't underestimate them.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.742
Right. Thank you for your
instructions. Good evening.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.751
Oh, by the way, unless you have
something very urgent to report,

39:48.853 --> 39:51.617
I suggest that you two keep shy
of each other for the next few days.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.555
That's in case Sebastian's people
want to check on you after your visit.

39:54.658 --> 39:56.717
Yes, I understand.
That's all. Good luck.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.727
Good evening.
Good night.

40:31.395 --> 40:34.922
Piano
Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.933
Will you tell Mr. Sebastian
that I'm here?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.633
Piano Continues

40:48.045 --> 40:50.138
Chattering, Laughter

41:29.620 --> 41:31.611
Miss Huberman?
Yes.

41:31.722 --> 41:34.122
Please forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

41:34.225 --> 41:37.524
Not at all.
You resemble your father very much.

41:37.628 --> 41:40.722
I'm Alex's mother.
I knew when I saw you.

41:40.831 --> 41:44.426
Alex has always admired you.
Now at last I know why.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.435
You're very kind.

41:46.537 --> 41:50.371
You did not testify at your father's
trial. We thought that unusual.

41:50.474 --> 41:53.966
He didn't want me to. He refused
to let his lawyers call me on the stand.

41:54.078 --> 41:56.012
I wonder why.

41:56.113 --> 41:59.082
Hello... Alicia.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.947
I'm so glad.
You met my mother.

42:02.052 --> 42:04.111
Yes, we just met.
You didn't meet Alicia...

42:04.221 --> 42:06.451
when we were in Washington
four years ago, did you, Mother?

42:06.557 --> 42:08.787
I don't know where
you were at the time.

42:08.893 --> 42:11.555
Alex, I think we should
join our other guests.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.829
May I take your wrap?
Thank you.

42:27.311 --> 42:31.475
Sebastian Miss Huberman,
may I present Eric Mathis?

42:31.582 --> 42:34.779
How do you do?
How do you do?

42:34.885 --> 42:37.319
William Rossner.

42:37.421 --> 42:39.582
How do you do?

42:39.690 --> 42:42.090
Very honored.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.217
Emil Hupka.

42:44.328 --> 42:46.353
How do you do?

42:46.463 --> 42:48.363
Delighted.

42:48.465 --> 42:50.899
And Mr. Knerr.

42:53.637 --> 42:55.867
And Dr. Anderson.

42:55.973 --> 42:58.203
Dr. Anderson.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.971
It gives me great pleasure.

43:03.914 --> 43:06.280
Dr. Anderson is our guest
of honor tonight.

43:06.383 --> 43:10.114
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman,
Alex, with discourses on science.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.154
Not before dinner, anyway.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.656
Butler
Dinner is served, madame.

43:16.627 --> 43:20.654
Dr. Anderson, you will sit
beside me, over there.

43:20.764 --> 43:24.222
Eric, you will sit
next to Miss Huberman.

43:24.335 --> 43:27.168
Dr. Anderson
You have just come from Spain, senora?

43:27.271 --> 43:29.398
Mrs. Sebastian
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.

43:29.506 --> 43:33.237
Travel does not mean anything
anymore. It goes so swift.

43:33.344 --> 43:36.211
Indistinct Whispering
One has the feeling
of not going anywhere.

43:36.313 --> 43:41.580
I suppose we can expect
rocket ships to be carrying us
across the ocean very soon.

43:41.685 --> 43:43.812
Dr. Anderson
You can expect many strange things.

43:43.921 --> 43:47.015
See a good movie
this afternoon, Eric?
No. I was disappointed.

43:47.124 --> 43:50.787
Hmm, must have been a comedy. You know,
Eric loves to go to the movies to cry.

43:50.894 --> 43:52.953
He's very sentimental.

43:53.063 --> 43:55.861
Mrs. Sebastian Rambling

43:55.966 --> 43:59.402
It takes nearly as long to go
from the city to the airport...

43:59.503 --> 44:02.404
as it does to cross
over the Atlantic.

44:14.985 --> 44:18.421
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that
something must be done about Emil.

44:18.522 --> 44:23.892
I don't know. It was an understandable
slip. The man was tired.

44:23.994 --> 44:27.088
No. It was
a very dangerous slip.

44:27.197 --> 44:30.530
It's not the first one. There have been
several other lapses before.

44:30.634 --> 44:33.034
There'll be more,
if we permit them.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.571
That's bad.
That's very bad.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.335
I think, gentlemen, you can
leave it to me to find some way.

44:38.442 --> 44:42.173
When you drive up to Petropolis,
the road winds quite a bit.

44:42.279 --> 44:44.179
It is very high.

44:44.281 --> 44:46.681
There are some
very awkward turns.

44:46.784 --> 44:51.653
I'm sure I will not have
any difficulty in getting Emil
to give me a lift in his car.

44:51.755 --> 44:54.918
It's quite a trick to jump clear.

44:55.025 --> 44:58.119
I'll just have to be careful,
that is all.

44:58.228 --> 45:00.423
Turned my ankle the last time.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.504
Madame says,
will you join the others...

45:12.609 --> 45:15.043
or will you take
your coffee in here?

45:15.145 --> 45:17.943
Oh, I think we'll take
coffee in here, Emil.

45:19.783 --> 45:24.311
I'm very sorry, gentlemen,
to make such an exhibition.

45:24.421 --> 45:27.618
Ah, nonsense.
We all have nerves.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.923
You have been overworking.
Don't you think so, Rossner?

45:32.029 --> 45:35.692
You need a rest. Your health
is very important to us.

45:35.799 --> 45:39.235
Oh, that's very considerate.
I am very tired.

45:39.336 --> 45:43.397
So, now I think perhaps
if you'll make my pardon...

45:43.507 --> 45:46.772
to the ladies, Alex, for my
leaving so early, then I

45:46.877 --> 45:50.335
Maybe, Emil, it would be better
if I came with you.

45:50.447 --> 45:53.245
I think that perhaps
if you try to drive yourself...

45:53.350 --> 45:56.114
all the way up to Petropolis,
it might be too much for you.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.279
I shall drive you.

45:58.388 --> 46:00.948
No. That would be
too much for you.

46:01.058 --> 46:03.219
All that way.
That's too much to ask.

46:03.327 --> 46:05.295
Nonsense.
I'd love to go.

46:05.395 --> 46:08.558
Come on, Emil.
Good night, gentlemen.

46:08.665 --> 46:10.496
Good night, Alex.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.570
I hope you'll feel better
in the morning, Emil.

46:13.670 --> 46:16.070
Thank you.
And I'm very sorry...

46:16.173 --> 46:18.835
to make a scene
before strangers.

46:18.942 --> 46:20.876
Very sorry.

46:20.978 --> 46:23.139
Thank you, Alex,
for an excellent dinner.

46:23.247 --> 46:26.876
And please tell your mother
for me that the dessert was superb.

46:29.853 --> 46:32.754
Crowd Cheering

46:38.462 --> 46:41.090
Miss Huberman has
been gone a long time.

46:41.198 --> 46:44.395
Mother, is it necessary for you to
always address Alicia as Miss Huberman?

46:44.501 --> 46:46.731
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.

46:46.837 --> 46:49.203
Really, I thought I was
behaving rather well.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.365
Has she been complaining about me?
Oh, no.

46:51.475 --> 46:54.171
I'm grateful.
You might smile at her.

46:54.278 --> 46:57.975
Wouldn't it be a little too much if
we both grinned at her like idiots?

46:58.081 --> 47:00.311
Please, Mother,
I want to enjoy myself.

47:00.417 --> 47:02.749
Is it so boring
to sit with me alone?

47:02.853 --> 47:05.151
Not at all, not at all.

47:10.294 --> 47:12.660
Hello.
Oh, hello.

47:12.763 --> 47:14.856
I thought I saw you.
How are you?

47:14.965 --> 47:18.196
Fine, thanks.
Great turnout, isn't it?
Yes.

47:18.302 --> 47:21.863
Where are they?
In a box in the stand.

47:21.972 --> 47:24.998
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.

47:25.108 --> 47:29.044
Don't telephone me anymore.
Just rely upon my popping up.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.774
Can you hear me?
Sure. Go ahead.

47:31.882 --> 47:35.045
Heard of a Dr. Anderson?

47:35.152 --> 47:37.882
No.
He's some kind of a scientist.

47:37.988 --> 47:42.891
Kind face, 60 years old, gray hair,
deep crease in forehead.

47:42.993 --> 47:45.894
Tall or short?
Short.

47:45.996 --> 47:48.590
Uh-huh.
Emil Hupka? Heard of him?

47:48.699 --> 47:50.599
No.

47:50.701 --> 47:55.365
He made quite a scene
about a wine bottle the other night.

47:55.472 --> 47:57.372
Didn't like the vintage?

47:57.474 --> 48:00.375
He seemed to think there was
something else in the bottle.

48:00.477 --> 48:03.913
Was there?
No. It was wine. We drank it.

48:04.014 --> 48:07.074
Has he pulled anything since?

48:07.184 --> 48:09.652
Haven't seen him since.

48:11.288 --> 48:15.850
Anything else?
Nothing important.

48:15.959 --> 48:19.690
Just a minor item that
you may want for the record.

48:19.796 --> 48:21.696
What is it?

48:21.798 --> 48:24.562
You can add Sebastian's name
to my list of playmates.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.940
Pretty fast work.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

48:33.043 --> 48:34.943
Skip it.

48:36.813 --> 48:39.611
Are you betting on this race?
No.

48:39.716 --> 48:42.549
Alex says number ten is sure to win.
He knows the owner.

48:42.653 --> 48:45.554
Thanks for the tip.
Alex says they have been
holding him back all season

48:45.656 --> 48:47.715
I can't help recalling
some of your remarks.

48:47.824 --> 48:50.918
About being a new woman.
Daisies and buttercups, wasn't it?

48:51.028 --> 48:53.428
You idiot.
What are you sore about?

48:53.530 --> 48:55.464
You knew very well
what I was doing.

48:55.565 --> 48:57.624
Did I?
You could have stopped me
with one word.

48:57.734 --> 48:59.827
But no, you wouldn't.
You threw me at him.

48:59.937 --> 49:03.236
I threw you at nobody.
Didn't you tell me to go ahead?

49:03.340 --> 49:05.968
A man doesn't tell a woman
what to do. She tells herself.

49:06.076 --> 49:09.568
You almost had me believing in that
little hokey-pokey miracle of yours

49:09.680 --> 49:12.376
that a woman like you
could ever change her spots.
Oh, you're rotten.

49:12.482 --> 49:15.280
That's why I didn't stop you.
The answer had to come from you.

49:15.385 --> 49:17.546
I see.
Some kind of love test.

49:17.654 --> 49:19.554
That's right.

49:19.656 --> 49:22.250
You never believed in me anyway,
so what's the difference?

49:22.359 --> 49:25.328
Lucky for both of us I didn't.
It wouldn't have been pretty
if I'd believed in you.

49:25.429 --> 49:28.523
If I'd figured, "She'd never be able
to go through with this.

49:28.632 --> 49:30.862
She's been made over by love. "

49:30.968 --> 49:35.371
If you only once had said
that you loved me. Oh, Dev.

49:35.472 --> 49:38.407
Listen. You chalked up another
boyfriend, that's all. No harm done.

49:38.508 --> 49:42.205
I hate you.
There's no occasion to.
You're doing good work.

49:42.312 --> 49:46.043
Number ten's out in front. Looks as if
Sebastian knows how to pick 'em.

49:46.149 --> 49:48.879
Is that all you have
to say to me?

49:48.986 --> 49:51.716
Dry your eyes, baby.
It's out of character.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.416
Except, keep on your toes.
It's a tough job we're on.

49:56.193 --> 49:58.787
Snap out of it.
Here comes dreamboat.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.821
Oh, hello, Alex.
It was so exciting.

50:02.933 --> 50:05.231
A beautiful horse.
Do you remember Mr. Devlin?

50:05.335 --> 50:07.235
How do you do?
Hello.

50:07.337 --> 50:10.568
Alicia tells me you had a bet
on number ten. Sorry I didn't
get the tip earlier.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.074
So long.
See you sometime, Dev.

50:13.176 --> 50:15.770
It was a wonderful race.
Did you have much money on the winner?

50:15.879 --> 50:17.779
I didn't see the race.
Didn't you?

50:17.881 --> 50:20.349
I thought I saw you looking
through your field glasses.

50:20.450 --> 50:23.078
I was watching you
and your friend, Mr. Devlin.

50:23.186 --> 50:25.746
I presume that's why
you left my mother and me.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.416
You had an appointment to meet him.
Don't be absurd.

50:28.525 --> 50:32.393
I met him purely by accident.
You didn't seem very anxious
to get away from him.

50:32.496 --> 50:35.397
Oh, he's just
I watched you.

50:35.499 --> 50:38.229
I thought maybe
you're in love with him.

50:38.335 --> 50:41.031
Don't talk like that.
I detest him.

50:41.138 --> 50:44.232
Really?
He's very good-looking.

50:44.341 --> 50:49.040
Alex, I've told you before.
Mr. Devlin doesn't mean a thing to me.

50:49.146 --> 50:51.979
I'd like to be convinced.

50:52.082 --> 50:56.849
Would you maybe care to convince me,
Alicia, that Mr. Devlin
means nothing to you?

50:59.056 --> 51:01.115
Car Horn Honks

51:01.224 --> 51:04.682
...pleased to hear, Senor Barbosa, that
our little theatrical plan is working.

51:04.795 --> 51:07.127
We've got hold of something
concrete for a change.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.323
I'm delighted, gentlemen.
What is it?

51:09.433 --> 51:12.459
Professor Wilhelm Otto Rensler
is working here in Brazil.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.697
One of Germany's scientific wizards.
I didn't know he was here.

51:15.806 --> 51:18.775
Oh, yes. He's living
and experimenting in Sebastian's house.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.139
They call him Dr. Anderson.
Knocking

51:21.244 --> 51:23.144
Entree.

51:23.246 --> 51:28.274
Excuse me, sir. Miss Huberman wishes
to see Captain Prescott or Mr. Devlin.

51:28.385 --> 51:30.910
What do you mean? She's here?
Yes, sir.

51:31.021 --> 51:33.489
Beardsley
Well, show her in, Ribiero.
Yes, sir.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.922
I don't like this.
I don't like her coming here.

51:36.026 --> 51:39.154
She's had me worried for some time.
A woman of that sort.

51:41.865 --> 51:43.924
What sort is that,
Mr. Beardsley?

51:44.034 --> 51:46.969
Oh, I don't think any of us have
any illusions about her character,
have we, Devlin?

51:47.070 --> 51:48.970
Not at all,
not the slightest.

51:49.072 --> 51:52.337
Miss Huberman is first,
last and always not a lady.

51:52.442 --> 51:55.605
She may be risking her life,
but when it comes to being a lady,

51:55.712 --> 51:58.647
she doesn't hold a candle
to your wife, sir,

51:58.748 --> 52:02.206
sitting in Washington playing
bridge with three other ladies
of great honor and virtue.

52:02.319 --> 52:04.446
Take it easy, Dev.
Sorry.

52:04.554 --> 52:06.954
I think those remarks
about my wife are uncalled-for.

52:07.057 --> 52:10.584
Withdrawn. Apologized, sir.
Door Opens

52:13.997 --> 52:16.158
How do you do, Miss Huberman?
How do you do?

52:16.266 --> 52:19.235
This is Mr. Beardsley
and Senor Julio Barbosa.

52:19.336 --> 52:21.304
Care to sit down?
Thank you.

52:21.404 --> 52:23.872
You have the esteem
of my government, senorita.

52:23.974 --> 52:26.169
But we are worried
about your visiting this office.

52:26.276 --> 52:30.178
I promise not to break the rules
again, but I need some advice
and I couldn't find Mr. Devlin.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.646
In fact, I need it before lunch.

52:32.749 --> 52:34.740
Something happened?

52:34.851 --> 52:37.319
Yes, something
rather confusing.

52:37.420 --> 52:40.321
Mr. Sebastian
has asked me to marry him.

52:40.423 --> 52:42.516
What?
Well, well.

52:42.626 --> 52:45.527
He, he wants me
to marry him right away,

52:45.629 --> 52:48.530
and I am to give him
my answer at lunch.

52:48.632 --> 52:51.760
But I didn't know what the department
might think about such a step.

52:51.868 --> 52:55.201
Are you willing to go this
far for us, Miss Huberman?

52:56.873 --> 52:59.034
Yes, if you wish.

52:59.142 --> 53:01.303
What do you think of this, Devlin?

53:03.213 --> 53:05.408
Oh, I think it's a useful idea.

53:05.515 --> 53:09.144
Well, you know the situation
better than any of us.

53:09.252 --> 53:12.551
May I ask what inspired
Alex Sebastian to go this far?

53:12.656 --> 53:15.318
He's in love with me.

53:15.425 --> 53:18.326
And he thinks
you're in love with him?

53:19.963 --> 53:23.057
Yes, that's what he thinks.

53:23.166 --> 53:25.726
Barbosa
Gentlemen, it's the cream of the jest.

53:29.239 --> 53:32.538
Then
Then it's all right?

53:33.677 --> 53:36.874
Well, yes. I'd, I'd say so.

53:36.980 --> 53:40.973
Of course, it's
a perfect marriage... for us.

53:41.084 --> 53:43.575
There's only one thing.
Won't it delay us a bit?

53:43.687 --> 53:45.746
Prescott
What do you mean?

53:45.855 --> 53:49.484
Well, Mr. Sebastian is a very romantic
fellow, isn't he, Alicia?

53:49.593 --> 53:51.686
Yes.

53:51.795 --> 53:55.788
Then he'll probably want to take
his bride away for a long honeymoon.

53:55.899 --> 53:58.697
Won't that hold us up?
Devlin's got a point there.

53:58.802 --> 54:01.396
Oh, I don't know. I think
we can rely on Miss Huberman...

54:01.504 --> 54:04.496
to get back
into the house quickly.

54:04.608 --> 54:07.168
Yes, I think I can manage that.

54:08.545 --> 54:11.036
Well, everything seems
to be nicely arranged.

54:11.147 --> 54:14.548
I don't think you need me here anymore,
do you, Captain Prescott?

54:14.651 --> 54:18.678
I do want to thank you,
Miss Huberman, very much.

54:18.788 --> 54:22.884
I think so far everything has been
managed with great intelligence.

54:22.993 --> 54:25.257
Barbosa
Yes. Thank you very much.

54:25.362 --> 54:28.456
Are you quite sure she didn't
come down here to see you?

54:28.565 --> 54:31.227
To capture the rich
Alex Sebastian for a husband?

54:31.334 --> 54:33.894
Don't be absurd, Mother.
She didn't even know I was here.

54:34.004 --> 54:36.529
We will discuss it
more fully tonight.

54:36.640 --> 54:39.040
We will not discuss it tonight.

54:43.847 --> 54:47.408
All these carping questions are merely
the expression of your own jealousy,

54:47.517 --> 54:50.577
just as you've always
been jealous of any woman
I've ever shown any interest in.

54:50.687 --> 54:52.882
In this case, there's
nothing more to discuss.

54:52.989 --> 54:55.856
You mean, then, you are
going ahead with this marriage?

54:57.360 --> 55:00.227
I mean that the wedding
will be next week.

55:00.330 --> 55:02.389
It'll be private.

55:02.499 --> 55:06.367
We shall both be pleased
to have you present, if you wish.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.726
Knocking At Door

55:36.166 --> 55:38.225
Oh.

55:38.335 --> 55:41.304
Good evening, sir. Madame.
Good evening, Joseph.

55:41.404 --> 55:45.636
Joseph. Joseph, it doesn't look
very cheerful in here.

55:45.742 --> 55:48.711
I'm sorry, sir. Madame Sebastian
wasn't certain you'd be back tonight.

55:48.812 --> 55:50.712
Why not?
I telegraphed her.

55:50.814 --> 55:53.874
Madame Sebastian said
we were all to retire, sir.

55:53.983 --> 55:57.919
Where is my mother?
Madame Sebastian
went to bed very early, sir.

55:58.021 --> 56:01.787
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm afraid this
isn't a very bright homecoming for you.

56:01.891 --> 56:04.086
That's all right, Alex.
Well, what shall we do?

56:04.194 --> 56:06.560
Shall we have Joseph arrange
a little food for us?

56:06.663 --> 56:09.188
Not unless you want to.
I'm rather tired myself.

56:09.299 --> 56:11.563
We'll go right up, then?
Good night.

56:11.668 --> 56:13.568
Good night, madame.

56:16.973 --> 56:19.806
I'd like to have all my dresses
put out on the beds here.

56:19.909 --> 56:22.707
Don't hang anything up.
I'd like to know where everything goes.

56:22.812 --> 56:25.872
Oh, Joseph, would you
have the closets aired?
Yes, madame.

56:30.987 --> 56:34.388
Oh, this isn't very large.
I'll need more room.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.401
This door is locked.
That's used for a storeroom, madame.

56:47.504 --> 56:49.802
Oh. May I have the key?

56:49.906 --> 56:52.670
I do not have the keys, madame.
Where are they?

56:52.776 --> 56:56.041
Madame Sebastian has charge
of all the house keys, madame.

56:57.380 --> 56:59.314
Oh.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.782
Do you know
where Mr. Sebastian is?

57:01.885 --> 57:05.946
I believe he is having a business
meeting downstairs in the study, madame.

57:08.091 --> 57:12.255
I miss Hupka. He was
a first-class metallurgist.

57:12.362 --> 57:14.592
Leykin is just as good.

57:14.697 --> 57:17.564
Such is your opinion.
But I don't want to criticize.

57:17.667 --> 57:21.763
What, uh, were you asking?
Oh, you want a report.

57:21.871 --> 57:25.272
A written report.
Well, my friends,

57:25.375 --> 57:27.468
my work is done.

57:27.577 --> 57:30.808
You've been successful.
Yes.

57:38.154 --> 57:41.214
Oh, I'm very sorry. I
Not at all. Come on in.

57:41.324 --> 57:44.225
No. I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I didn't know you were busy.

57:44.327 --> 57:47.558
Some of the closets are locked.
Could you give me the keys?

57:47.664 --> 57:50.224
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'd forgotten about the keys.

57:50.333 --> 57:53.325
Of course.
I'll get them for you at once.

58:00.009 --> 58:03.467
I'll bring the keys to you
right away, my dear.

58:03.580 --> 58:06.879
Light Knocking
Mother? Mother?

58:06.983 --> 58:09.213
Mrs. Sebastian
Come in.

58:09.319 --> 58:11.753
Door Opens, Closes

58:11.855 --> 58:14.323
Sebastian
Mother, Alicia wants the keys
to get into the closets.

58:14.424 --> 58:17.621
Mrs. Sebastian
I think they can be safer
left to me. After all

58:17.727 --> 58:20.127
Sebastian
Please, Mother, stop arguing!
Give me those keys!

58:20.230 --> 58:23.131
Mrs. Sebastian
I will not. You won't get
these keys, and that's that.

58:23.233 --> 58:27.465
Sebastian
Mother, will you please
give me the keys? Thank you.

58:37.814 --> 58:40.009
Well, here they are.

58:40.116 --> 58:43.449
Afraid I'm going to be busy
for the rest of the morning,
my dear.

58:43.553 --> 58:46.454
See you at lunch.
Thank you, dear.

59:00.937 --> 59:03.633
Mr. Sebastian
has the key for this, madame.

59:03.740 --> 59:05.731
It's the wine cellar.

59:18.285 --> 59:21.345
Well, then, the wine cellar
is the obvious place to look.

59:21.454 --> 59:24.480
Car Horns Honking
Alex has the key to that.

59:24.591 --> 59:26.491
Then get it from him.

59:26.593 --> 59:28.788
Get it? How?

59:28.895 --> 59:31.125
Don't you live hear him?

59:32.766 --> 59:35.030
What do I look for
if I get the key?

59:35.135 --> 59:39.003
You look for a bottle of wine,
like the one that rattled
the fellow at dinner that night.

59:39.105 --> 59:42.734
All the bottles look alike to me.
I'm no mastermind.

59:42.842 --> 59:45.242
You're doing all right.

59:48.048 --> 59:50.073
It's no fun, Dev.

59:51.818 --> 59:54.548
Too late for that now,
isn't it?

59:54.654 --> 59:59.216
Look, uh, why don't you persuade
your husband to throw a large shindig...

59:59.326 --> 01:00:03.285
so that he can introduce his bride
to Rio society, say sometime next week?

01:00:03.396 --> 01:00:06.058
Why?
Consider me invited,

01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:09.727
and I'll try and find out
about that wine cellar business.

01:00:11.471 --> 01:00:16.374
I don't think my husband is
interested in entertaining just yet.

01:00:16.476 --> 01:00:19.206
The honeymoon isn't over, huh?

01:00:21.014 --> 01:00:23.414
Don't underestimate
your charms, Mrs. Sebastian.

01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:25.416
You can handle it.

01:00:25.518 --> 01:00:27.748
I don't think it's going
to be so easy about you.

01:00:27.854 --> 01:00:29.754
He thinks
you're in love with me.

01:00:29.856 --> 01:00:32.757
Well, then tell him you thought
if you invited me to the house...

01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:35.293
and I saw
how happily married you were,

01:00:35.395 --> 01:00:39.422
then the horrid passion I have
for you might be torn out of me.

01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:41.557
That sounds very logical.

01:00:41.668 --> 01:00:43.932
Good. Next week, then,
and get the key.

01:00:44.037 --> 01:00:47.666
I have to fly up to Berlin,
but I'll be back in time.

01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:49.674
All right.

01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:52.006
I'll be looking forward
to seeing you.

01:00:52.112 --> 01:00:54.512
It's always a pleasure
meeting you, madame.

01:01:31.251 --> 01:01:33.651
Sebastian I'm surprised
at Mr. Devlin coming tonight.

01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:37.245
I don't blame anyone for being
in love with you, darling.

01:01:37.357 --> 01:01:42.454
Il just hope that nothing will happen
to give him any false impression.

01:01:42.562 --> 01:01:44.757
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:01:54.207 --> 01:01:56.107
Darling.

01:01:59.913 --> 01:02:02.381
It's not that I don't trust you,
but when you're in love at my age,

01:02:02.482 --> 01:02:04.382
every man who looks
at a woman is a menace.

01:02:04.484 --> 01:02:07.612
Will you forgive me
for even talking about it?

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.086
I'm very contrite.

01:03:07.947 --> 01:03:10.677
Well, I think we might join
the rest of the party now.

01:03:10.783 --> 01:03:13.843
I think all our guests are here.

01:03:21.494 --> 01:03:23.553
Where can I find Alex Sebastian?

01:03:23.663 --> 01:03:26.063
By the drawing room, sir.
Thanks.

01:03:42.749 --> 01:03:44.649
Hello, Dev.
Good evening.

01:03:53.226 --> 01:03:55.319
You haven't seen the house,
have you?

01:03:55.428 --> 01:03:57.328
Well, it's quite
a jolly, little cottage.

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.330
Let me show you
around the place.

01:03:59.432 --> 01:04:01.559
Later.
He's on the trail.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.531
Devlin, glad to see you.
Good evening.

01:04:06.639 --> 01:04:08.800
It was kind of your bride
to invite me.

01:04:08.908 --> 01:04:12.969
We both invited you, Mr. Devlin. See
that our guest is fed, my dear, amused.

01:04:13.079 --> 01:04:16.173
You know what
Oh, excuse me.

01:04:16.282 --> 01:04:18.682
Madame Esterich,
I'm so glad to see you.

01:04:21.854 --> 01:04:24.687
This isn't going to be easy.
Why?

01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:27.021
He, uh... he's quite sensitive
about you.

01:04:27.126 --> 01:04:29.253
He's going to watch us
like a hawk.

01:04:29.362 --> 01:04:32.024
Yes, he's rather jealous
of anyone.

01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:34.361
Where'd you get the key,
off his chain?

01:04:34.467 --> 01:04:36.367
Yes.

01:04:36.469 --> 01:04:40.428
Let's hope the liquor doesn't run out
and start him down the cellar for more.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.168
Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
Quite a point.

01:04:47.714 --> 01:04:49.614
Thank you.

01:04:49.716 --> 01:04:51.741
Oh, Mr. Devlin. How nice.
You remember me?

01:04:51.851 --> 01:04:55.116
Senora Ortiz.
How sweet. Young men
usually have short memories.

01:04:55.221 --> 01:04:57.781
Oh, here's something I adore
champagne.

01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.790

Joseph?

01:05:09.569 --> 01:05:12.970
Madame?
Do you think you have enough
champagne to last the evening?

01:05:13.072 --> 01:05:15.632
I don't know, madame.
I hope so.

01:05:33.326 --> 01:05:35.624
Enjoying yourself, Mr. Devlin?
Very much, thank you.

01:05:35.728 --> 01:05:38.128
There's so many things I would
like to ask about the States.

01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:41.723
I haven't heard anything
for a long time.
I'll be glad to tell you.

01:05:41.834 --> 01:05:44.325
Will you excuse me?
Would you mind?

01:05:44.437 --> 01:05:46.337
Certainly.

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:59.141
Laughing

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.420
We better hurry.
Lots of time.

01:06:02.522 --> 01:06:05.116
No, Joseph might have
to ask Alex for more wine.

01:06:05.224 --> 01:06:07.249
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.955
He's running out
faster than he thought.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:06:11.064 --> 01:06:13.726
Laughing Continues
Is he, uh, watching?

01:06:13.833 --> 01:06:16.131
Yes. You'd better go out
in the garden alone...

01:06:16.235 --> 01:06:19.671
and wait around back of the house for me
and I'll show you the wine cellar door.

01:06:30.783 --> 01:06:33.513
Nice party, isn't it?
It's a wonderful party.

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:36.247
And you're doing wonderfully well.
I'm very proud.

01:06:36.355 --> 01:06:40.815
Mr. Devlin bothering you much?
Oh, no, darling.
He's trying to drown his sorrow.

01:07:21.634 --> 01:07:25.365
Excuse me. I think I'll ask the
orchestra to play some Brazilian music.

01:07:25.471 --> 01:07:28.269
They've played waltzes all evening.
Go, my dear.

Right.

01:07:55.501 --> 01:07:58.664
I'll keep the garden door open,
and I'll tell you if anything happens.

What happened?

01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:09.264
Look. Vintage sand.

01:09:11.477 --> 01:09:14.173
Hmm. We've got to leave things
as we found them.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:17.272
Help me find a bottle of wine
with the same label as these others.

01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:19.283
But it isn't really sand, is it?

01:09:19.385 --> 01:09:21.785
No, I think it's some kind
of metal ore.

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:39.331
This is a bit weird.
I'm terrified.

01:09:39.438 --> 01:09:41.962
Just pretend you're a janitor.
Janitors are never terrified.

01:09:42.073 --> 01:09:43.974
I have a feeling
we're very slow.

01:09:44.076 --> 01:09:45.975
Well, we're on schedule.
Take it easy.

01:09:46.078 --> 01:09:49.844
I keep hearing someone coming.
Oh, that'll be nice.

01:09:51.317 --> 01:09:55.219
Think if he comes down with Joseph.
Unfortunate.

01:10:10.336 --> 01:10:12.236
Okay.

01:10:16.943 --> 01:10:18.843
Whispering
Come on.

01:10:25.284 --> 01:10:28.151
Whispering Continues
Someone is coming!

01:10:28.254 --> 01:10:30.449
It's Alex! He's seen us!

01:10:30.556 --> 01:10:32.854
Wait a minute. I'm going to kiss you.
No, he'd only think we'd

01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:35.086
That's what
I want him to think.

01:10:40.199 --> 01:10:42.724
You'd better stay upstairs,
Joseph. They may need you.

01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:45.668
Yes, sir.

01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:51.742
Sighing
Oh, Dev. Dev.

01:10:59.885 --> 01:11:01.580
Whispers
Push me away.

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:08.392
I'm sorry to intrude
on this tender scene.

01:11:08.494 --> 01:11:10.758
Il couldn't help what happened.
He's been drinking.

01:11:10.863 --> 01:11:14.026
Oh. So he carried you down here.

01:11:14.133 --> 01:11:16.897
Oh, please, Alex.

01:11:17.003 --> 01:11:19.995
You love him.
No, of course not. Please go.

01:11:20.106 --> 01:11:23.303
For what it's worth, as an apology,
your wife is telling the truth.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.969
I knew her before you,
loved her before you.

01:11:26.078 --> 01:11:28.842
But I wasn't as lucky as you.
Sorry, Alicia.

01:11:28.948 --> 01:11:31.041
Please go.
Good night.

01:11:36.055 --> 01:11:38.922
Sighs Alex, don't be foolish.
Il came down here...

01:11:39.025 --> 01:11:41.323
because he threatened to make a scene
unless I'd see him alone.

01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:43.258
He kissed you.

01:11:43.362 --> 01:11:45.796
Il couldn't stop him.
I tried.

01:11:45.898 --> 01:11:48.458
We'll talk about it later.

01:11:48.567 --> 01:11:50.933
Your guests are upstairs.

01:11:51.037 --> 01:11:52.937
Will you please go to them?

01:12:01.547 --> 01:12:04.141
Oh, Mr. Devlin,
are you going so soon?

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.480
Yes, I'm afraid I have to be up
early in the morning.

01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:08.644
Thank you and good night.

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:14.525
Oh, Joseph.
Yes, sir.

01:12:14.627 --> 01:12:17.255
We can go down for the wine now.
Yes, sir.

01:12:39.819 --> 01:12:42.185
You know, Joseph,

01:12:42.288 --> 01:12:44.722
I don't think we need
give them any more champagne.

01:12:44.824 --> 01:12:47.622
We still have some upstairs,
haven't we?
Yes, sir.

01:12:48.894 --> 01:12:51.260
And some whiskey and wine?

01:12:51.363 --> 01:12:53.763
Yes, sir.
Well, I think we'll give them that.

01:12:53.866 --> 01:12:55.766
Very good, sir.

01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:07.811
I'm sorry
about what happened, Alex.

01:13:07.913 --> 01:13:12.748
Oh, my dear, I shall never
forgive myself for behaving
like a stupid schoolboy.

01:13:14.353 --> 01:13:16.253
Then you believe me?
Well, of course.

01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:19.449
It isn't worth mentioning again.
Thank you.

01:13:19.558 --> 01:13:21.526
Are you coming up?
Not for a little while.

01:13:21.627 --> 01:13:23.925
Dr. Anderson's waiting for me
in the study.

01:13:24.029 --> 01:13:26.293
Sleep well.

01:13:26.398 --> 01:13:29.060
It was a very successful party.

01:13:29.168 --> 01:13:31.102
Good night, then.
Good night.

01:13:31.203 --> 01:13:33.467
Thanks for being so nice.

01:17:12.991 --> 01:17:14.891
Why are you up so early?

01:17:17.096 --> 01:17:20.657
I need your help.
Something is wrong?

01:17:22.267 --> 01:17:25.236
A great deal. Alicia.

01:17:29.408 --> 01:17:31.569
I have expected it.

01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:34.145
I knew. I knew.

01:17:34.246 --> 01:17:36.942
What is it? Mr. Devlin?

01:17:38.517 --> 01:17:39.916
No.

01:17:44.656 --> 01:17:46.681
I am married
to an American agent.

01:18:16.622 --> 01:18:20.217
Yes. It is easy to see now.

01:18:21.326 --> 01:18:23.624
I knew, but I didn't see.

01:18:23.729 --> 01:18:25.629
They picked her
because of her father.

01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:28.700
I must have been insane, mad,

01:18:28.801 --> 01:18:31.827
behaved like an idiot to believe
in her with her clinging kisses.

01:18:31.937 --> 01:18:34.201
Stop wallowing
in your foul memories.

01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:36.740
Then what do I do?

01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:39.242
There's nothing to do.
I'm done, finished.

01:18:42.247 --> 01:18:44.340
They'll find out.
They won't find out.

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:46.350
They'll find out
what I'm married to.

01:18:46.452 --> 01:18:49.319
Look what they did to Emil Hupka
Emil, who did nothing.

01:18:49.421 --> 01:18:52.322
And I've betrayed them.
I've bungled, and there's no excuse.

01:18:54.193 --> 01:18:57.060
I'd do the same myself
kill the fool that betrayed them.

01:18:57.162 --> 01:18:58.925
There's no need
for them to find out.

01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:01.761
Mathis is very sharp.
Yes. He dislikes you.

01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:04.358
But his criticism of your
talents wouldn't go that far...

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:07.530
to imagine that you are married
to an American agent.

01:19:07.639 --> 01:19:10.938
We are protected by
the enormity of your stupidity.

01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:13.876
For a time.
Alicia. I'll take care of her myself.

01:19:13.979 --> 01:19:18.109
No. Not that way.
I stood looking at her
when she was asleep.

01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:20.913
I could have
Quiet, Alex!

01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:26.681
You're almost as impetuous
as before your wedding.

01:19:26.792 --> 01:19:29.124
You barred me from that episode.

01:19:29.228 --> 01:19:31.423
Let me arrange this one.

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:35.159
Listen to me.
No one must know what she is.

01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:39.328
There must be no suspicion
of her, of you or me.

01:19:39.438 --> 01:19:42.407
She must be allowed
to move about freely.

01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:44.635
But she will be on a leash.

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:48.201
She will learn
nothing further to inform.

01:19:48.313 --> 01:19:52.909
She must go,
but it must happen slowly.

01:19:53.018 --> 01:19:55.316
If she could become ill...

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.446
and remain ill for a time, until

01:20:06.732 --> 01:20:10.429
Drink your coffee, darling.
It's getting cold.

01:20:10.536 --> 01:20:12.629
Alicia
Are you going out this afternoon, Alex?

01:20:12.738 --> 01:20:16.731
No, my dear. I have some letters
to write. What are you going to do?

01:20:16.842 --> 01:20:19.470
Oh, I just have a little shopping.

01:20:19.578 --> 01:20:22.274
I'd like to go to the Imperiale.
Maybe I'll go to Cosmo's...

01:20:22.381 --> 01:20:24.349
and see if they have any new
books in from New York.

01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:28.749
If you're going there, will you go
and see if my cigars have arrived?

01:20:28.854 --> 01:20:30.913
Should be about 1,000 of them.
If they have,

01:20:31.023 --> 01:20:33.924
ask them to keep them in
the humidor for me, will you?

01:20:37.496 --> 01:20:39.521
Prescott Anything wrong?
No.

01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:42.532
No, the light bothers me.
I have a bit of a headache.

01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:44.966
Would you mind?
Oh, yes. I think we can fix that.

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:47.061
Thank you.

01:20:47.172 --> 01:20:52.007
You know, some people get too much sun
down here. You must be careful.

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:56.444
I think you can be very proud
of yourself, Mrs. Sebastian.

01:20:56.548 --> 01:20:59.949
That sand that Devlin brought in
shows uranium ore.

01:21:00.052 --> 01:21:01.952
So now we know
what we're driving at.

01:21:02.054 --> 01:21:06.991
And your job from now on will be
to try to help us find out
where that sand comes from.

01:21:07.092 --> 01:21:09.720
The location of the uranium
deposit is of vast importance,

01:21:09.828 --> 01:21:12.023
and we're putting
quite a few people on it.

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:15.827
But I think you'll be of great help.
All right.

01:21:15.934 --> 01:21:19.028
But that isn't
the main reason why I asked you
to come up here this afternoon.

01:21:19.137 --> 01:21:21.367
No?
No. I wanted to tell you...

01:21:21.473 --> 01:21:25.307
that I'm going to change
your contact in about a week.

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:27.435
Mr. Devlin's been transferred
to Spain.

01:21:29.081 --> 01:21:31.242
To Spain?

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:33.409
Does Mr. Devlin know that?
Oh, yes.

01:21:33.518 --> 01:21:35.543
He asked for the transfer.
Why?

01:21:35.654 --> 01:21:38.054
Well, I guess he thought
he was going stale here.

01:21:38.156 --> 01:21:40.454
Oh, he wants to leave Rio?

01:21:40.559 --> 01:21:44.689
Yes. I guess he thought he'd
find... Spain more interesting.

01:21:44.796 --> 01:21:47.060
Yes, I imagine it would be.

01:21:47.165 --> 01:21:51.795
There really isn't very much
for a brainy fellow like Mr. Devlin
to do in Rio anymore.

01:21:51.903 --> 01:21:54.463
Well, of course,
it is more or less routine now.

01:21:56.341 --> 01:22:00.175
In the meantime, I am to report
to Mr. Devlin as usual?

01:22:00.278 --> 01:22:03.213
Oh, yes. He'll be here
until the new man arrives.

01:22:03.315 --> 01:22:05.875
Thank you, Captain Prescott.

01:22:05.984 --> 01:22:08.282
I'll keep my ears wide open.
Goodbye.

01:22:08.387 --> 01:22:10.548
Goodbye.
Oh, and, uh...

01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:13.957
go easy on that sun, hey?

01:22:25.971 --> 01:22:28.098
Daring, what is it?

01:22:28.206 --> 01:22:30.731
I don't know. I
Are you in pain?

01:22:30.842 --> 01:22:33.868
Yes, I
I'm so dizzy. I

01:22:33.979 --> 01:22:35.879
Wh-What happened to her?

01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:37.881
We were walking,
and she was stricken suddenly.

01:22:37.983 --> 01:22:40.281
I'll be all right.
Let's go inside.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.440
I'm sorry
I couldn't make it on time.

01:23:04.543 --> 01:23:07.478
It gets a bit lonely
squatting on a bench all day.

01:23:07.579 --> 01:23:10.571
Yes, Rio can be a very dull town.

01:23:10.682 --> 01:23:12.616
What's new?

01:23:12.718 --> 01:23:14.948
Nothing.
What's new with you?

01:23:15.053 --> 01:23:16.953
Nothing.

01:23:19.191 --> 01:23:22.251
Any domestic troubles
about the other night?

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.386
No.
Any footprints in that sand yet?

01:23:25.497 --> 01:23:28.432
Sighs
No. Nothing yet.

01:23:28.533 --> 01:23:30.967
Just a social visit, huh?

01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:33.970
A little fresh air helps.

01:23:35.207 --> 01:23:37.402
You don't look so hot.

01:23:39.211 --> 01:23:41.202
Well
Sick?

01:23:42.314 --> 01:23:44.976
No. Hangover.

01:23:47.853 --> 01:23:50.253
That's news.
Back to the bottle again, huh?

01:23:50.355 --> 01:23:54.553
It sort of...
lightens my chores.

01:23:54.659 --> 01:23:57.423
Big party?
Just the family circle.

01:23:57.529 --> 01:24:02.831
Sounds quite jolly.
It helps life in a dull town.

01:24:02.934 --> 01:24:05.528
You ought to take it easy
on that liquor.

01:24:07.105 --> 01:24:11.542
Don't you find Rio
a little hard to take too?

01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:16.479
Not a bad town.

01:24:16.581 --> 01:24:19.175
You look all mashed up.
Must have been quite an evening.

01:24:20.285 --> 01:24:22.276
Yeah. It was.

01:24:22.387 --> 01:24:25.584
Okay. If you wanna play
that way, go on. Have fun.

01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:29.091
No reason why you shouldn't.
That's right, Dev.

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:32.061
Here's something that belongs to you.
I should have given it to you sooner.

01:24:32.164 --> 01:24:35.361
What is it?
A scarf that you leant me once,

01:24:35.467 --> 01:24:37.492
in Miami.

01:24:42.073 --> 01:24:43.973
Cleaning house, huh?

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.880
Well, goodbye, Dev.

01:24:52.517 --> 01:24:55.577
What do you mean, "goodbye"?

01:24:55.687 --> 01:24:58.622
Nothing. Just goodbye.

01:24:58.723 --> 01:25:00.953
Fresh air isn't as good
for a hangover as I thought.

01:25:01.059 --> 01:25:03.527
Sit down.
You're still tight.

01:25:03.628 --> 01:25:05.528
I don't want to.

01:25:06.798 --> 01:25:09.164
Where are you going?

01:25:09.267 --> 01:25:11.394
Back... home.

01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:18.933
You are not taking care
of yourself, Alicia.

01:25:19.044 --> 01:25:21.638
Oh, I feel much better.

01:25:21.746 --> 01:25:23.771
You look like something awful.

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:27.584
The circles under the eyes.

01:25:29.888 --> 01:25:34.791
My dear child, you must have a doctor
find out what is the matter with you.

01:25:34.893 --> 01:25:37.293
Alicia
I never go near doctors.

01:25:37.395 --> 01:25:40.455
They always want
to cart you off to a hospital.

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:43.125
Dr. Anderson
Maybe you belong in a hospital.

01:25:44.569 --> 01:25:48.801
Tell me.
When did you first feel sick?

01:25:50.609 --> 01:25:52.509
Oh, II don't remember.

01:25:52.611 --> 01:25:55.444
Maybe the party... I think.

01:25:55.547 --> 01:26:00.075
I still think a sea trip would
be much better for you, darling,
than doctors and hospitals.

01:26:00.185 --> 01:26:03.086
A little cruise somewhere.
Maybe Spain?

01:26:03.188 --> 01:26:05.088
Put the roses
back in your cheeks, my sweet.

01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:07.784
I don't think so.
I don't care much for boats.

01:26:07.893 --> 01:26:09.724
We could go together, my dear,

01:26:09.828 --> 01:26:12.888
if you could bear to leave Alex
behind for a few weeks.

01:26:12.998 --> 01:26:15.899
I think I'd prefer Alex
to a case of seasickness.

01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:21.002
I always get seasick.

01:26:21.106 --> 01:26:25.236
Then you might like
the mountains, hmm?

01:26:25.343 --> 01:26:28.312
The air is fresh and pure and...

01:26:28.413 --> 01:26:30.313
I am going next week.

01:26:30.415 --> 01:26:33.942
Oh, you're leaving?
I'm sorry. I'll miss you.

01:26:34.052 --> 01:26:38.011
Yes. I'm delaying my work
too long.

01:26:38.123 --> 01:26:42.753
If you'll come with me,
the mountains won't make you seasick.

01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:47.025
And the Imorez Mountains are beautiful
covered with flowers and

01:26:47.132 --> 01:26:51.000
Oh, um, what Alicia needs
is rest, not mountain-climbing.

01:26:51.102 --> 01:26:53.696
I've heard about the Imorez.

01:26:53.805 --> 01:26:55.705
Did you? Really?

01:26:55.807 --> 01:26:58.776
Mmm, yes.

01:26:58.877 --> 01:27:01.505
About the beautiful
little native towns.

01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:03.911
Tell me,
are you going to Leopoldina?

01:27:04.015 --> 01:27:06.279
No, no, no.
I'm going to Santa Ma

01:27:06.384 --> 01:27:07.942
Care for some more brandy,
Otto?

01:27:08.053 --> 01:27:11.113
No, no, thank you.

01:27:11.222 --> 01:27:14.680
I, er, never drink more than one brandy,
and even this is sometimes too much.

01:27:14.793 --> 01:27:16.784
I'll just finish my coffee.

01:27:16.895 --> 01:27:19.159
No, that is not your cup!
But that's Ali

01:27:20.432 --> 01:27:22.525
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:27:22.634 --> 01:27:26.263
Yeah, perhaps, uh,
Alex is right, my dear child.

01:27:26.371 --> 01:27:28.737
When you're young,
rest's the best doctor.

01:27:30.575 --> 01:27:34.136
And if you...
lie still for a few days,

01:27:34.245 --> 01:27:37.476
reading, relaxing,
forgetting all your troubles,

01:27:37.582 --> 01:27:41.518
it might be as well as medicine
or sea air.

01:27:41.619 --> 01:27:43.985
When I come back,
you will be all well,

01:27:44.089 --> 01:27:45.989
making us all very happy once more.
Gasping

01:27:46.091 --> 01:27:47.991
Gasping Continues
Oh!

01:27:51.863 --> 01:27:54.855
Excuse me, II want to go to bed.
I feel

01:27:54.966 --> 01:27:58.925
Pain again, darling?
I'm sorry to complain again.

01:28:00.939 --> 01:28:03.737
Shall I take you
up to your room?

01:28:03.842 --> 01:28:05.742
May I help you, my dear?

01:28:05.844 --> 01:28:08.677
Some hot water, maybe?

01:28:10.515 --> 01:28:13.848
Gasps
No. No, please. Don't bother.

01:28:13.952 --> 01:28:16.250
I'll be all right.

01:28:16.354 --> 01:28:19.755
If she doesn't feel better in the
morning, I insist you call a doctor.

01:28:19.858 --> 01:28:22.383
I don't like
the way she looks, Alex.

01:28:22.494 --> 01:28:24.962
I'm worried about her.

01:28:25.063 --> 01:28:26.963
I'm afraid she's very ill.

01:28:27.065 --> 01:28:30.796
Chattering Continues, Indistinct

01:28:49.888 --> 01:28:51.788
Gasping

01:28:56.327 --> 01:28:58.591
Alicia! Alicia!
Joseph. Joseph.

01:28:58.696 --> 01:29:01.494
Help me take her up to her room.
You must take her up to bed.

01:29:01.599 --> 01:29:03.999
Come on, my dear.

01:29:10.442 --> 01:29:12.842
Okay. I told you she is sick.

01:29:12.944 --> 01:29:15.572
Come on.
Don't exert yourself. Come.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.171
Be quiet.

01:29:18.283 --> 01:29:22.515
No! Go! Go away!
No! No!

01:29:32.063 --> 01:29:34.531
Chattering, Indistinct
No, I don't want to go.

01:29:34.632 --> 01:29:37.692
It's some sort of spasm.
I'm sure it's not serious.

01:29:37.802 --> 01:29:39.827
We must get a doctor.

01:29:39.938 --> 01:29:42.930
Poor child is suffering too much.
I'll call the hospital.

01:29:43.041 --> 01:29:45.635
I'll get a doctor.
Don't worry, dear Otto.

01:29:45.743 --> 01:29:47.734
We'll get a doctor
a good one.

01:29:47.846 --> 01:29:50.246
We'll take
the best care of her.

01:29:50.348 --> 01:29:53.010
Sighing

01:29:53.118 --> 01:29:55.814
Sebastian
Joseph, disconnect the telephone.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.150
Madame must have absolute quiet.

01:29:58.256 --> 01:30:00.156
Take it out of the room, Joseph.

01:30:03.061 --> 01:30:04.961
Car Horns Honking

01:30:27.852 --> 01:30:29.683
Five days, eh?

01:30:29.787 --> 01:30:33.587
Say, that must be
quite a binge she's on.
I don't think so.

01:30:33.691 --> 01:30:36.751
Well, you said she was drinking
last week and drunk when you saw her.

01:30:36.861 --> 01:30:40.160
Yes, but I've had time
to think it over.
Think what over?

01:30:40.265 --> 01:30:42.825
That drinking of hers.
I don't believe it.

01:30:42.934 --> 01:30:45.767
Why should she lie to you
about that?

01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:47.770
I don't know.
She wasn't drunk.

01:30:47.872 --> 01:30:51.000
She was sick.
Maybe that's why she hasn't shown up.

01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:53.009
She looked like
the ragged end of nowhere.

01:30:53.111 --> 01:30:54.908
Well, it still sounds
like a hangover.

01:30:55.013 --> 01:30:57.447
Yes, but I'm gonna pay her a call.
Now, wait a minute.

01:30:57.549 --> 01:31:01.383
I don't want you to mess
things up. We hope to close
this case out in a few days.

01:31:01.486 --> 01:31:04.114
I won't mess anything up.
Just a social call.

01:31:04.222 --> 01:31:06.087
I, uh, I'm a friend
of the family.

01:31:06.191 --> 01:31:09.558
All right. Go ahead if you want to,
but don't take any chances.

01:31:09.661 --> 01:31:12.391
Oh, and, uh, call me up
when you get back.

01:31:12.497 --> 01:31:14.590
I'll do that.
'Kay.

01:31:40.158 --> 01:31:42.058
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.685
Family home tonight?
Yes, sir.

01:31:44.796 --> 01:31:48.061
Would you mind telling Mr. Sebastian
that Mr. Devlin is here?

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.866
What is it, Joseph?
I'm very sorry, sir,

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:56.100
but since Mr. Sebastian asked me
not to disturb him, I don't know.

01:31:56.207 --> 01:31:58.107
Asleep?
No, sir.

01:31:58.209 --> 01:32:00.609
He's in the study with
some business associates, sir.

01:32:00.712 --> 01:32:02.942
How long do you think
he'll be tied up?
I don't know, sir.

01:32:03.047 --> 01:32:05.982
Mrs. Sebastian home?
Uh, yes, sir.

01:32:06.084 --> 01:32:08.644
Would you mind telling her?
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

01:32:08.753 --> 01:32:12.553
Why not?
Mrs. Sebastian is very ill
and confined to her bed.

01:32:14.259 --> 01:32:16.750
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
How long has she been ill?

01:32:16.861 --> 01:32:19.056
A week.
Has she had a doctor?

01:32:19.163 --> 01:32:22.997
I think so, sir.
We're all very concerned about her.

01:32:23.101 --> 01:32:26.730
If you will wait here, Mr. Devlin,
I'll tell Mr. Sebastian.

01:32:26.838 --> 01:32:28.738
Right.

01:32:35.647 --> 01:32:37.877
Excuse me, sir.
What is it, Joseph?

01:32:37.982 --> 01:32:40.314
Mr. Devlin to see you, sir.

01:32:40.418 --> 01:32:43.979
Oh. Tell him I'll be with him
in a minute, will you?

01:32:44.088 --> 01:32:45.988
Yes, sir.

01:32:47.592 --> 01:32:50.493
Go on, Professor.
This sounds serious to me.

01:32:50.595 --> 01:32:53.428
To me also.
What happened Monday?

01:32:53.531 --> 01:32:55.431
Same thing.

01:32:55.533 --> 01:32:58.229
When I left the bank,
a man was following me.

01:32:58.336 --> 01:33:01.533
But this morning, when I went
to the ticket office,

01:33:01.639 --> 01:33:04.870
the same man came inside
and stood beside me.

01:33:54.826 --> 01:33:56.726
Door Closes

01:34:11.509 --> 01:34:13.875
Alicia. Alicia.

01:34:18.449 --> 01:34:20.417
Weakly
Dev.

01:34:21.686 --> 01:34:23.586
Alicia,
what's wrong with you?

01:34:23.688 --> 01:34:25.849
I'm so glad you came.

01:34:27.992 --> 01:34:31.621
I had to.
I couldn't stand any more...

01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:33.720
waiting and worrying about you.

01:34:34.899 --> 01:34:37.424
That wasn't a hangover
you had that day.

01:34:37.535 --> 01:34:40.527
You were sick then.
What is it?

01:34:40.638 --> 01:34:42.697
Yes, I was sick.

01:34:44.242 --> 01:34:46.676
What's wrong with you, Alicia?

01:34:46.778 --> 01:34:50.214
Oh, Dev.
What is it, dear?
What's wrong with you?

01:34:52.383 --> 01:34:54.510
They're poisoning me.

01:34:54.619 --> 01:34:57.213
I couldn't get away from them.

01:34:57.321 --> 01:34:59.414
I tried, but I was too weak.

01:34:59.524 --> 01:35:01.424
How long?

01:35:02.727 --> 01:35:05.195
Since the party.

01:35:05.296 --> 01:35:07.628
Alex and his mother found out.

01:35:12.103 --> 01:35:14.230
Come on. Try and sit up.

01:35:14.338 --> 01:35:17.501
Sit up. I'm going
to get you out of here.

01:35:17.608 --> 01:35:20.202
I thought you had gone.

01:35:20.311 --> 01:35:23.769
No. I had to see you once,
speak my piece.

01:35:23.881 --> 01:35:26.372
I was getting out
because I love you.

01:35:26.484 --> 01:35:28.884
I couldn't bear
seeing you and him together.

01:35:35.993 --> 01:35:38.154
Oh, you love me.

01:35:38.262 --> 01:35:41.163
Why didn't you tell me before?

01:35:41.265 --> 01:35:43.165
I know.

01:35:43.267 --> 01:35:45.735
But I couldn't see straight
or think straight.

01:35:46.871 --> 01:35:50.671
I was a fatheaded guy,
full of pain.

01:35:50.775 --> 01:35:52.675
It tore me up not having you.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.580
Oh, you love me.

01:35:58.816 --> 01:36:00.716
Oh, you love me.

01:36:00.818 --> 01:36:03.150
Long ago. All the time,
since the beginning.

01:36:07.592 --> 01:36:09.492
Here, put on your robe.

01:36:11.295 --> 01:36:13.786
Come on.
Yes.

01:36:13.898 --> 01:36:16.128
Try to sit up.
Yes.

01:36:17.969 --> 01:36:20.301
Oh, Dev. I'm afraid...

01:36:20.404 --> 01:36:25.000
I can't make it because
they gave me pills to sleep.

01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:27.669
Keep awake. Keep talking.

01:36:27.778 --> 01:36:30.338
Yes.
Have you got a coat?

01:36:30.448 --> 01:36:32.746
In the closet.

01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:35.512
They didn't want
the others to know about me.

01:36:42.426 --> 01:36:44.326
Keep talking.

01:36:48.533 --> 01:36:51.024
Go on. What happened?

01:36:51.135 --> 01:36:54.161
What happened?
Alex found out.

01:36:54.272 --> 01:36:58.936
And the others haven't?
They'd kill him if they knew.

01:36:59.043 --> 01:37:01.511
They killed Emil.

01:37:01.612 --> 01:37:05.571
Are you in pain?
I don't know. The pills.

01:37:05.683 --> 01:37:07.708
Give me your feet.
Yes.

01:37:09.487 --> 01:37:12.354
Say it again.
It keeps me awake.

01:37:12.456 --> 01:37:15.050
I love you.

01:37:15.159 --> 01:37:17.252
Stand up. Stand up.

01:37:17.361 --> 01:37:20.853
Oh.
Come on. Wake up. Talk.

01:37:20.965 --> 01:37:24.230
Dr. Anderson

01:37:24.335 --> 01:37:26.269
Go on, go on. Walk, talk.

01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:31.034
The sand comes
from the Imorez Mountains.

01:37:31.142 --> 01:37:33.042
We'll find it.

01:37:33.144 --> 01:37:35.942
From a town
Santa Ma-something.

01:37:36.047 --> 01:37:38.174
Good girl.
We'll take care of it later.

01:37:38.282 --> 01:37:40.546
Come on. Keep awake. Keep walking.
Oh, I'm afraid!

01:37:40.651 --> 01:37:43.552
Dev, I'm afraid. They're all
in the house. We can't make it.

01:37:51.128 --> 01:37:53.460
Oh, don't ever leave me.

01:37:53.564 --> 01:37:55.964
You'll never
get rid of me again.

01:37:57.234 --> 01:37:59.600
Never tried to.

01:37:59.704 --> 01:38:01.501
Brace up. Here he comes.

01:38:06.744 --> 01:38:09.975
What are you doing, Alicia?
What is this, Mr. Devlin?

01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:12.811
I'm taking her to the hospital
to get the poison out of her.

01:38:12.917 --> 01:38:16.353
Poison?
How'd you like your friends
downstairs to know?

01:38:16.454 --> 01:38:18.888
They've yet to be told.
I'm taking her back to her room.

01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:21.652
No, Dev. I'll raise
quite a rumpus, if you try.

01:38:21.759 --> 01:38:25.024
Alex. He knows?

01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:27.063
Yes.
Dr. Anderson
What is happening, Alex?

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.796
Alicia!
She is worse?

01:38:31.902 --> 01:38:33.961
Mrs. Sebastian Yes.
Go.

01:38:34.071 --> 01:38:36.301
All right, dear.
We're going. We're going.

01:38:36.407 --> 01:38:39.865
You haven't forgotten what they did
to Emil, have you, Sebastian?

01:38:42.847 --> 01:38:45.645
Whispering
Help him, Alex.

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:48.548
I'm glad you
have a head on you, madame.

01:38:48.653 --> 01:38:51.315
I'm not afraid to die.

01:38:51.422 --> 01:38:54.482
You've got your chance here and now.
Tell them who she is.

01:38:55.926 --> 01:38:58.520
Need any help, Alex?

01:38:58.629 --> 01:39:00.927
No, we can handle her.
Where are you taking her?

01:39:03.601 --> 01:39:07.059
You answer that one, Sebastian.
To the hospital.

01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.571
Whispering
Alex, talk to them, quick!

01:39:14.679 --> 01:39:16.613
Glad she's going.

01:39:16.714 --> 01:39:18.614
You should not have waited
so long, Alex.

01:39:21.318 --> 01:39:23.684
Well, what am I going to do,
start shooting?

01:39:26.057 --> 01:39:28.184
Hold on. You've only got
about 20 yards to go.

01:39:28.292 --> 01:39:31.056
What happened, Alex?
Hmm?

01:39:32.663 --> 01:39:37.259
Oh, um... she collapsed.

01:39:37.368 --> 01:39:41.634
Mr. Devlin heard her scream when he
was waiting for me. Come on, Alicia.

01:39:41.739 --> 01:39:45.573
Yes, I telephoned the hospital
as soon as I saw how she was.

01:39:45.676 --> 01:39:47.644
You have a car? You heard, Alex.
Out in front.

01:39:47.745 --> 01:39:49.736
You're going with them, madame?

01:39:49.847 --> 01:39:53.783
No. Alex will call me up.
I'll wait here.

01:39:53.884 --> 01:39:56.318
Chatters, Indistinct

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.320
Poor child.

01:40:00.758 --> 01:40:03.556
How do you feel?
A bit dizzy.

01:40:03.661 --> 01:40:06.152
Take some deep breaths.
Just hurry, hurry.

01:40:17.374 --> 01:40:20.571
Now just a minute.
I must sit with her!
No room, Sebastian.

01:40:20.678 --> 01:40:23.112
But you must take me.
They're watching me.
That's your headache.

01:40:23.214 --> 01:40:24.613
Engine Starts
Please take me! Please!

01:40:24.715 --> 01:40:27.775
Please! Please!

01:40:27.885 --> 01:40:31.685
There is no telephone
in her room to call the hospital.

01:40:31.789 --> 01:40:35.190
Eric
Alex, will you come in, please?

01:40:35.292 --> 01:40:37.192
I wish to talk to you.
