02:00.286 --> 02:01.921
The moment of truth.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.923
Mr. Şekerci, do you take Katja Jessen

02:37.090 --> 02:39.993
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

02:41.594 --> 02:42.629
I do.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.632
Ms. Jessen, now to you.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.368
Do you take Nuri Şekerci

02:48.535 --> 02:52.005
to be your lawfully wedded husband?
If so, answer "I do."

02:53.006 --> 02:54.240
I do.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.911
Congratulations.
You may exchange rings.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.415
Is this OK, too?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.084
Of course.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.519
Can I kiss her now?

03:12.192 --> 03:16.496
THE FAMILY

03:37.317 --> 03:38.251
You fucker!

03:38.418 --> 03:40.653
Fucking son-of-a-bitch fucker!

03:42.188 --> 03:43.857
- You OK?
- Yeah.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.297
"Son-of-a-bitch fucker?"
Did you get that from Dad?

03:51.431 --> 03:54.801
- No, from my violin lesson.
- You're a lil’ gangsta!

03:57.237 --> 03:59.205
What's your Social Security Number?

03:59.639 --> 04:01.207
I forgot it, dude.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.575
Forgot it?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.979
It's your life!

04:06.312 --> 04:07.714
What's mine is yours.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.082
"Forgot it..."

04:18.791 --> 04:21.428
- He wanted to see you.
- You need the car.

04:21.628 --> 04:22.929
I'm meeting Birgit.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.067
- What about my taxes?
- I'll do them tonight.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.102
Why not take the train?

04:29.402 --> 04:32.572
Aunt Birgit is pregnant.
Show a little em-pa-thy!

04:33.173 --> 04:34.474
Right!

04:35.075 --> 04:38.311
Hear that?
My son will make it further than me!

04:38.712 --> 04:40.947
That won't be too hard, dude.

04:47.253 --> 04:48.922
It's by the bridal store.

04:49.089 --> 04:49.923
Thanks.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.991
What time do you finish?

04:52.325 --> 04:53.326
Seven.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.695
I'll pick you guys up.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.464
- No need.
- I will anyway.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.100
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mommy.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.470
Not too much screen time!

05:03.636 --> 05:04.971
I already have glasses...

05:06.039 --> 05:07.807
Do you have yours?

05:15.448 --> 05:17.150
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.524
Lock that up or they'll steal it.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.359
I'm coming right back.

05:56.656 --> 05:57.590
A drag.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.259
Just one, pretty please.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.195
One more.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.663
Bitch.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.834
- Let's stop by the baby store.
- You can have Rocco's old clothes.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.638
- You'll need them again.
- So, give them back when yours is bigger.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.542
Let's do something really hot instead.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.977
Buy a huge dildo.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.182
You have no idea how under-fucked I am.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.386
- Exactly.
- You need a comedown.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.455
I just need to come.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.962
Is that new?

06:36.863 --> 06:38.264
It's not finished.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.599
A samurai.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.436
- Must've hurt like hell.
- So bad!

06:43.770 --> 06:46.006
- It's great.
- Thanks.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.042
I promised Nuri it's the last one.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.444
He'll leave me otherwise.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.492
Hope my baby doesn't slip out.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.427
Me too.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.800
This is so good.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.771
This is so good!

07:52.472 --> 07:54.307
The street's blocked off.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.676
My husband's office is right there.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.345
Call this number.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.315
- What happened?
- An explosion. Move along.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.163
Freeze!

08:19.833 --> 08:20.700
Freeze!

08:21.768 --> 08:23.636
I have to get to my family!

08:28.775 --> 08:31.745
On the ground! Calm down.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.383
Let me go, I have to get to my family!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.254
Rocco!

08:43.990 --> 08:45.091
Nuri!

08:48.361 --> 08:49.662
Come in.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.031
Follow me.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.169
Mrs. Şekerci?

08:57.904 --> 08:59.172
Let me go.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.907
- Can I help you?
- I just want...

09:01.074 --> 09:02.776
- Rocco?
- Are you looking for someone?

09:03.309 --> 09:04.411
Mrs. Şekerci?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.714
Fischer from Missing Persons.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.482
Where's my family?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.651
Your relatives aren't here.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.186
Where are they?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.821
We don't know.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.157
There were fatalities: a man and a child.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.375
The bodies can't be identified.
We have to do a DNA test.

10:01.501 --> 10:05.872
IN THE FADE

10:59.159 --> 11:01.661
Just your husband's and son's.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.166
Thanks. It'll take a few hours.
The Red Cross will stay here.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.648
See you later, Mrs. Şekerci.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.124
Shall we go to the living room?

11:31.624 --> 11:32.826
Come with me.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.128
This way?

12:10.096 --> 12:12.832
Would you like to call someone?

12:54.474 --> 12:55.842
Mrs. Şekerci,

12:56.976 --> 12:59.012
I have sad news.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.916
The victims are your husband and son.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.229
Mrs. Şekerci?

13:17.430 --> 13:20.433
Chief Inspector Reetz.
I'm leading the investigation.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.906
My sincere condolences.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.412
Do you feel able
to help with the investigation?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.315
Can't this wait till tomorrow?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.989
It's OK, Mom.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.832
Was your husband religious?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.235
Excuse me?

13:56.202 --> 13:57.804
Was he a Muslim?

14:00.073 --> 14:01.908
My husband is agnostic.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.210
Was he Kurdish?

14:04.411 --> 14:07.080
I'm Kurdish! Why do you ask that?

14:10.383 --> 14:12.652
Was he politically active?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.388
Did he raise money for any groups?

14:15.622 --> 14:18.992
No, my husband wasn't politically active.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.395
Did he have enemies?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.399
What kind of enemies?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.705
A bomb was set off in front of his office.

14:33.907 --> 14:34.908
What?

14:35.075 --> 14:38.078
We have to assume he was the target.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.229
Where did you last see
your husband and son?

14:58.932 --> 15:01.067
This afternoon. I dropped Rocco...

15:01.735 --> 15:03.470
at his office.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.939
Did you notice anything?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.610
No.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.050
Wait, a woman left her bike out front.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.789
I told her to lock it up.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.529
It was new,

15:30.096 --> 15:31.731
with a top case

15:31.965 --> 15:33.767
on the luggage rack.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.736
Like on a motorcycle, you know?

15:37.470 --> 15:40.040
Could you help create a composite sketch

15:40.440 --> 15:42.942
and look through our picture database?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.650
I want to see my loved ones.

15:51.818 --> 15:54.320
They're no longer people.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.856
Only body parts, Mrs. Şekerci.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.541
Do you think they suffered?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.778
I'm sure they didn't feel a thing.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.319
Imagine Rocco lying on the ground,

16:26.519 --> 16:29.155
seeing his own limbs around him.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.627
Imagine how scared he was.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.536
They didn't feel a thing, Katja.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.472
They died immediately.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.698
What are they saying?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.902
"The nail bomb attack

17:16.169 --> 17:18.238
killed convicted drug dealer..."

17:18.505 --> 17:19.873
Motherfuckers.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.342
"... Nuri S., 37,

17:23.910 --> 17:26.813
and his son Rocco, six.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.750
An Islamist or political motive

17:30.917 --> 17:32.719
has been ruled out."

17:33.720 --> 17:34.654
Let me see.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.759
BOMB EXPLOSION ON SHOPPING STREET!

17:41.594 --> 17:44.898
POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR THIS PERSON
THOUGHT TO HAVE PLANTED THE BOMB.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.100
SHE IS PROBABLY EASTERN EUROPEAN.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.538
He was mixed up in something.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.308
Like what, Mom?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.544
You should know.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.050
Maybe he was keeping something from you.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.254
Don't ever say that about my husband.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.389
DANILO FAVA, LAWYER

18:43.223 --> 18:44.724
- Katja?
- Yes.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.209
Can I get you a drink?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.549
Was Nuri still dealing?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.487
He'd stopped that.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.364
Was it about protection money?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.867
Nuri could've handled that.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.373
Was he involved in anything?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.508
Anything you know of?

19:37.477 --> 19:40.513
He wouldn't have put you guys at risk.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.317
So, who did it?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.686
They're looking for an Eastern European.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.794
She was German.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.463
As German as me.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.274
Nazis did it.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.881
Who else would've had a motive?

20:16.049 --> 20:17.717
Did you tell that to the cops?

20:30.330 --> 20:32.065
Do you have anything here?

20:34.701 --> 20:35.902
Sure.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.905
What do you need?

20:39.539 --> 20:40.874
Whatever.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.959
Katja, please. They were gifts
from clients. I'd only throw them away.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.128
Thanks.

21:36.763 --> 21:40.233
We want to take our son and grandson

21:40.633 --> 21:42.135
with us to Turkey.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.637
So, they're close to us.

21:44.838 --> 21:46.940
We're going back for good.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.111
He's my grandson, too!

21:59.586 --> 22:00.787
Excuse me.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.179
I've lost my family.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.581
And you want to take them away again.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.316
You can't.

22:31.251 --> 22:33.153
I won't let you.

22:58.178 --> 22:59.212
Good.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.548
Well done.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.788
Shit.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.392
It's alright, it's alright...

23:43.256 --> 23:45.058
This one's for Nuri.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.689
Thanks for coming.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.991
You know,

25:25.492 --> 25:27.861
if you'd taken better care,

25:28.595 --> 25:30.997
my grandson would still be alive.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.476
My condolences.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.496
Katja, can you come here?

26:08.902 --> 26:10.570
Good morning, Mrs. Şekerci.

26:11.338 --> 26:16.276
Developments in the investigation
mean we must search the property.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.478
What developments?

26:18.712 --> 26:22.215
This warrant permits us
to search your house.

26:22.916 --> 26:26.152
Mr. Hartung from the district authority
is here to observe.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.320
Hello.

26:27.487 --> 26:29.589
Please stay with your visitors.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.127
Stay where you are!

26:44.637 --> 26:46.072
Would you please fill this out?

26:46.239 --> 26:48.074
Gerrit, could you come here?

26:53.480 --> 26:54.814
I found this.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.716
- That's all?
- Yeah.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.551
Keep searching.

27:05.258 --> 27:07.560
- Her husband's drugs.
- Mom, stop.

27:07.761 --> 27:10.063
- Katja!
- Stay out of this.

27:12.399 --> 27:13.800
They're mine.

27:15.602 --> 27:17.637
Please step into the kitchen.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.141
Just briefly.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.458
Can we have a minute?

27:46.166 --> 27:47.300
Do you have more?

27:50.170 --> 27:54.007
Possession of narcotics
violates Section 29.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.543
You may remain silent.

27:58.011 --> 28:00.947
But I do need you to come to the station.

28:01.815 --> 28:03.717
To answer a few questions.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.119
Contact my lawyer.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.689
Don't worry, Mrs. Şekerci.

28:10.623 --> 28:14.627
It's such a small quantity,
there's no chance of prosecution.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.601
Surely you want to know
who murdered your family.

28:23.670 --> 28:26.673
Without your help,
we won't find the killers.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.887
Any idea who might've done it?

28:42.689 --> 28:44.190
Nazis did it.

28:45.425 --> 28:46.693
How so?

28:47.527 --> 28:50.196
His office is in a Turkish neighborhood.

28:52.032 --> 28:54.567
Were there ever racist incidents there?

28:55.669 --> 28:58.338
Like a pig's head in front of the mosque?

28:58.505 --> 29:00.340
Not that I know of.

29:02.709 --> 29:03.710
Would you like some?

29:15.689 --> 29:17.857
How did you meet your husband?

29:18.725 --> 29:21.094
I bought grass from him as a student.

29:21.728 --> 29:23.263
What did you study?

29:24.230 --> 29:26.399
German studies and art history.

29:26.666 --> 29:28.268
Did you graduate?

29:29.636 --> 29:31.338
I dropped out.

29:32.005 --> 29:33.406
Why?

29:36.910 --> 29:40.914
Your husband studied business in prison,
then opened his office.

29:42.415 --> 29:45.518
He was a tax advisor and translator.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.987
And he sold flights to Turkey.

29:48.455 --> 29:50.423
Do you know how much he earned?

29:50.790 --> 29:52.759
I did the bookkeeping.

29:53.660 --> 29:55.829
Do you have any other work?

30:01.935 --> 30:03.403
I was a mother.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.111
You have a big house. Wasn't it expensive?

30:12.278 --> 30:14.647
It's out of town and
has poor public transport.

30:15.415 --> 30:18.284
Your husband's annual income
was 50,000 euros.

30:18.785 --> 30:22.956
How could he afford
a 70,000 euro deposit on the house?

30:25.058 --> 30:26.459
How do you know that?

30:26.659 --> 30:28.495
From his tax documents.

30:29.396 --> 30:31.631
Some of the files survived.

30:34.801 --> 30:37.337
The money was from my father-in-law.

30:37.704 --> 30:38.972
A loan.

30:39.139 --> 30:41.174
Where did he get so much money?

30:41.574 --> 30:43.843
He owns land in southeast Turkey.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.079
Does he grow anything?

30:49.516 --> 30:50.850
Like cotton?

30:54.521 --> 30:55.955
Houses.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.791
He grows houses.

31:00.660 --> 31:04.164
You want me to incriminate my husband
and confirm your theory.

31:04.397 --> 31:05.498
What theory?

31:05.799 --> 31:07.901
That he was still dealing drugs!

31:08.702 --> 31:11.905
For months, the drugs unit
has been surveilling suspects.

31:12.172 --> 31:15.909
Some repeatedly called your husband.
Can you explain that?

31:16.176 --> 31:19.679
My husband interpreted for offenders.
He had to speak to them.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.414
It was his job!

31:27.887 --> 31:31.624
- Why are you investigating my husband?
- We're not investigating him.

31:31.891 --> 31:33.693
He didn't murder anyone!

31:33.860 --> 31:35.395
He was murdered!

31:35.795 --> 31:37.197
We have to assume

31:37.364 --> 31:40.967
that your husband maintained his links
to the criminal world.

31:42.302 --> 31:45.538
We believe he engaged
in criminal activities with the murderers.

31:46.539 --> 31:48.475
Maybe there was a disagreement,

31:48.742 --> 31:52.112
and your son and husband
were victims of revenge.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.348
So, who did it?

31:55.548 --> 31:56.883
The Turkish mafia.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.252
Or the Kurdish one.

32:00.754 --> 32:03.056
Maybe the Albanians.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.127
We'd hoped you could help us.

32:36.289 --> 32:37.924
Can I have a beer, Michi?

32:38.091 --> 32:39.492
Sure thing.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.801
Why did you do that?

32:49.336 --> 32:50.470
What?

32:50.804 --> 32:53.106
Say they were your drugs.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.945
Because it's true, Mom.

32:59.946 --> 33:02.182
You're getting yourself in trouble!

33:05.652 --> 33:08.154
What did your husband turn you into?

33:11.958 --> 33:13.660
What did you say?

33:17.163 --> 33:18.965
Annemarie, let's pack.

33:19.532 --> 33:20.800
Thanks, Michi.

33:31.578 --> 33:33.046
Fuck off!

33:44.657 --> 33:46.226
Take care, Katja.

35:15.582 --> 35:17.083
Want some tea?

35:20.253 --> 35:21.821
Pregnancy tea?

35:27.761 --> 35:30.263
Should I leave you alone for a few days?

35:33.166 --> 35:34.534
Yes.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.609
I can't leave you like this.

35:43.376 --> 35:45.445
But I want to be alone.

35:51.451 --> 35:53.453
I'm always here for you, OK?

35:56.790 --> 35:58.692
Call me any time.

37:57.077 --> 37:59.979
Hi Katja, it's Danilo. I tried your cell.

38:00.146 --> 38:03.283
Listen, you were right: Nazis did it.

38:35.148 --> 38:38.184
You have one new message.

38:38.585 --> 38:40.320
First message:

38:42.188 --> 38:45.025
Hi Katja, it's Danilo. I tried your cell.

38:45.392 --> 38:47.060
Listen, you were right.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.630
Nazis did it. They've been arrested.

38:50.997 --> 38:52.298
Call me.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.735
End of messages.

39:35.975 --> 39:39.979
Welcome to the Şekercis'.
This is yours truly, Boss Şekerci.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.548
And back there...

39:41.748 --> 39:43.183
Rocco Şekerci!

39:43.683 --> 39:45.285
Say "hello," Rocco.

39:46.453 --> 39:48.288
Thank you. Rocco Şekerci!

39:48.888 --> 39:51.458
And the fabulous woman next to him

39:51.624 --> 39:53.960
is car mechanic Şekerci!

39:54.194 --> 39:55.128
Say "hello!"

39:56.129 --> 39:57.564
What's she up to?

40:02.402 --> 40:04.804
And now... it should work.

40:07.574 --> 40:09.109
You're the best!

40:16.916 --> 40:18.385
Who's the best?

40:20.520 --> 40:23.390
Look, I'm boring now. He's over me.

40:23.590 --> 40:24.858
He's over us.

40:26.626 --> 40:30.897
JUSTICE

40:34.300 --> 40:36.603
- Good morning, Mrs. Möller.
- Good morning.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.204
Are you ready?

40:38.371 --> 40:40.907
Good. My colleague will handcuff you.

40:41.441 --> 40:43.243
Roll up your sleeve, please.

41:37.597 --> 41:39.366
Good morning. Please be seated.

41:43.336 --> 41:44.604
I hereby open the trial

41:44.871 --> 41:47.974
of Edda Möller and André Möller.

41:48.675 --> 41:53.546
I note the presence of the defendants,

41:53.713 --> 41:55.415
their defense attorneys,

41:55.582 --> 41:58.885
the public prosecutor,
the approved joint plaintiffs,

41:59.085 --> 42:00.720
and their attorneys.

42:00.920 --> 42:04.724
Excuse me, your Honor.
I have an urgent request.

42:04.924 --> 42:09.929
I hereby move that witness Şekerci
be removed from the courtroom. Thank you.

42:10.697 --> 42:14.834
Mrs. Şekerci has a right
to be present as co-plaintiff.

42:15.368 --> 42:18.972
Attorney, allow the prosecutor
to read the charges first.

42:19.339 --> 42:21.808
Please remove Mrs. Şekerci. Thank you.

42:22.342 --> 42:23.510
I will not.

42:23.710 --> 42:26.746
Then I formally request a court decision.

42:27.714 --> 42:31.184
Mrs. Şekerci is a key prosecution witness.
Thank you.

42:31.351 --> 42:35.989
His Honor and the prosecutor have
overwhelming evidence at their disposal.

42:36.189 --> 42:38.925
She must leave. If she stays,

42:39.192 --> 42:44.531
she will be privy to all the evidence and
other testimonies before she testifies.

42:44.731 --> 42:48.601
She will of course
adapt her own testimony accordingly.

42:48.868 --> 42:50.770
The witness will be worthless.

42:50.970 --> 42:56.042
I therefore request that witness Şekerci
be removed from the courtroom. Thank you.

42:56.376 --> 43:01.414
My client appreciates the attorney's
concern regarding her testimony's value.

43:01.881 --> 43:06.252
She will nonetheless exercise her right
to be present as co-plaintiff.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.456
I reject your motion, attorney.

43:09.723 --> 43:13.727
Then I request an immediate decision
by the entire court. Thank you.

43:15.328 --> 43:18.965
Very well. I hereby suspend
the proceedings. Please remain seated.

43:20.633 --> 43:21.701
What's going on?

43:21.868 --> 43:24.871
He's trying to disrupt procedure,
hoping the judge falters.

43:25.071 --> 43:27.107
- It's all he has.
- I'm staying.

43:30.243 --> 43:32.078
I hereby announce our decision.

43:32.278 --> 43:36.883
As a co-plaintiff, Katja Şekerci
is entitled to be present at the trial.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.590
We can now hear the charges.
Prosecutor, go ahead.

43:43.757 --> 43:48.795
"On October 20, 2016, Hamburg,
André and Edda Möller are accused

43:48.995 --> 43:54.801
of having acted in concert, on malicious
and base grounds, to murder two people

43:55.001 --> 43:58.805
and maliciously attempt to murder
an indefinite number of others

43:59.005 --> 44:04.044
by knowingly, intentionally
and collaboratively conspiring

44:04.277 --> 44:09.683
to plant a pre-prepared "nail bomb" made
from fertilizer, diesel and 500 nails,

44:09.849 --> 44:13.520
and, by detonating it, to murder or injure

44:13.687 --> 44:16.690
as many foreign residents as possible..."

44:17.524 --> 44:18.958
Stay home tomorrow.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.293
Why?

44:20.493 --> 44:22.328
It might be too rough.

44:24.664 --> 44:26.166
See you tomorrow.

44:35.442 --> 44:37.010
They're rotting in there.

44:46.286 --> 44:49.622
The first danger
is the shock wave caused by the blast.

44:49.789 --> 44:54.861
The child suffered inhalation trauma
in the upper respiratory tract,

44:55.061 --> 45:00.867
and also barotrauma with acute distention
and peripheral bleeding in both lungs.

45:01.501 --> 45:03.870
The second danger is debris and shrapnel.

45:04.070 --> 45:08.508
The child had a gaping 3 cm wound
in the central upper abdomen

45:08.708 --> 45:12.946
caused by a jagged metal fragment
that was still embedded.

45:13.179 --> 45:15.615
It also pierced the eighth vertebra.

45:15.782 --> 45:19.352
The resulting wound
ripped the small and large intestines.

45:19.552 --> 45:23.790
It also tore the liver
and totally severed the abdominal artery.

45:24.190 --> 45:29.229
The torso sustained
over 14 small, round and linear wounds

45:29.496 --> 45:33.199
with nails up to 10 cm long
embedded at various depths.

45:33.433 --> 45:35.935
The third danger is the immense heat.

45:36.102 --> 45:39.572
The center of the explosion
briefly reaches up to 1,000 °C.

45:40.273 --> 45:44.077
There were extensive burns
to the front of the body, head, face,

45:44.244 --> 45:47.013
torso, arms and thighs.

45:47.213 --> 45:52.018
The hair was burnt to the scalp
at the front of the skull.

45:52.218 --> 45:55.689
The eyes also sustained burns
and had totally melted.

45:55.989 --> 46:00.960
The right forearm
was roughly severed at the elbow joint.

46:01.227 --> 46:03.430
The limb was found 6 m from the body.

46:03.630 --> 46:06.232
- I can't take anymore.
- You want out?

46:06.833 --> 46:08.902
One moment. Yes, Mr. Fava?

46:09.102 --> 46:12.439
- I request a short break.
- A break of five minutes.

46:15.608 --> 46:17.510
Look at me, you cunt!

46:19.179 --> 46:20.347
Stop that at once!

46:21.514 --> 46:23.249
I'll kill you!

46:33.993 --> 46:35.095
Two more shots.

46:35.295 --> 46:36.629
Not for me.

46:37.297 --> 46:38.965
You don't want another?

46:39.132 --> 46:41.101
I'm driving my son
to kindergarten tomorrow.

46:55.915 --> 46:58.284
You gave Möller a good smack.

47:03.189 --> 47:05.859
Imagine if they'd gotten me and Rocco.

47:06.059 --> 47:08.028
If Nuri had survived.

47:13.333 --> 47:16.036
He wouldn't have stood
for all the chit-chat.

47:24.511 --> 47:26.246
I changed my mind. One more.

47:33.520 --> 47:39.826
Mrs. Şekerci, I can well understand
your emotional reaction, your outrage.

47:40.193 --> 47:43.063
But this court deals only in facts.

47:43.830 --> 47:47.133
Should there be another incident,
the court must eject you

47:47.334 --> 47:51.371
for the rest of the trial
for disorderly conduct.

47:52.572 --> 47:54.307
Even as co-plaintiff.

47:55.508 --> 47:59.479
So long as the accused
are not found guilty by a court,

47:59.879 --> 48:02.082
they are presumed innocent.

48:02.282 --> 48:03.850
Do you understand?

48:07.387 --> 48:09.522
I call witness Möller.

48:11.558 --> 48:13.193
Witness Möller, please.

48:16.596 --> 48:17.931
Good morning, Mr. Möller.

48:18.732 --> 48:20.433
Please sit down.

48:30.643 --> 48:34.247
Mr. Möller, as a father
and direct relative,

48:34.447 --> 48:38.118
you may refuse to testify
against your son and daughter-in-law.

48:38.284 --> 48:39.586
Is that clear?

48:39.786 --> 48:40.920
Yes.

48:41.221 --> 48:43.356
- But you wish to testify?
- Yes.

48:43.690 --> 48:45.892
Then please proceed.

48:48.928 --> 48:51.398
I live in Meldorf, Schleswig-Holstein.

48:51.731 --> 48:54.901
The last storm felled a tree in my garden.

48:55.535 --> 48:58.405
I went to the garage
to fetch the chainsaw.

48:58.605 --> 49:02.942
It's on my property,
but my son uses it because I have no car.

49:03.276 --> 49:05.845
He lives next door,
but we avoid each other.

49:06.413 --> 49:08.248
Why do you avoid each other?

49:08.615 --> 49:11.251
We fell out over his worldview.

49:12.318 --> 49:13.987
What is his worldview?

49:14.954 --> 49:17.991
The one that led to these accusations.

49:19.359 --> 49:21.594
Could you elucidate?

49:24.931 --> 49:26.599
My son reveres Adolf Hitler.

49:30.870 --> 49:36.109
You were looking for
the chainsaw in the garage.

49:36.810 --> 49:38.445
What happened next?

49:38.978 --> 49:42.315
I saw a plastic bag of fertilizer

49:42.515 --> 49:44.084
and an oil can.

49:44.250 --> 49:46.119
I didn't think much of it.

49:46.286 --> 49:49.656
But there were also
at least seven packs of nails.

49:49.956 --> 49:52.192
I remembered the Hamburg attack.

49:52.826 --> 49:54.461
I wanted to stop him from copying it.

49:54.627 --> 49:57.597
André has priors
for assault and disorderly conduct.

49:57.831 --> 50:01.101
I went to the police
and asked them to stop him.

50:08.208 --> 50:10.176
Please continue, Mr. Möller.

50:10.744 --> 50:14.347
They sent over some experts.
After their search,

50:15.849 --> 50:17.384
they told me...

50:20.820 --> 50:22.756
I'll never forget it...

50:24.224 --> 50:28.595
"You wanted to protect your son
from a crime he already committed."

50:30.997 --> 50:32.532
And then?

50:33.199 --> 50:36.102
- The police arrested André and Edda.
- Mr. Möller...

50:36.903 --> 50:39.172
it was your son's garage?

50:40.040 --> 50:41.174
Yes.

50:43.343 --> 50:44.878
You had a key?

50:45.311 --> 50:47.013
No, I didn't.

50:48.381 --> 50:51.651
- How did you get in?
- I know where the key's hidden.

50:52.986 --> 50:56.990
- Can you tell us where?
- Under a big stone by the entrance.

50:57.424 --> 50:59.659
- Outside by the door?
- Yes.

51:00.827 --> 51:03.163
Did anyone else know?

51:03.329 --> 51:06.733
- Your son's friends?
- I don't know.

51:07.701 --> 51:12.572
So, it's conceivable
that other people knew of the key

51:12.772 --> 51:15.775
and had access to the garage?

51:16.476 --> 51:19.245
- That's possible.
- Thank you.

51:20.613 --> 51:23.416
- Yes, Mr. Fava?
- Mr. Möller,

51:23.717 --> 51:27.387
you don't know if anyone else knew
of the key. What does that mean?

51:30.056 --> 51:33.093
Did you ever see anyone else
enter the garage?

51:33.560 --> 51:35.328
My daughter-in-law.

51:37.163 --> 51:38.498
Anyone else?

51:38.798 --> 51:40.200
No, never.

51:40.533 --> 51:41.768
Fine.

51:42.936 --> 51:45.538
- May I add something?
- Go ahead.

51:49.309 --> 51:51.378
I want to take the opportunity

51:51.544 --> 51:54.881
to offer my condolences to the victims.

51:56.649 --> 52:00.153
I'm so sorry for what happened.

52:02.055 --> 52:04.824
You never get over losing a relative.

52:06.426 --> 52:08.261
What my son did is wicked,

52:08.728 --> 52:11.131
cowardly, and stupid.

52:38.124 --> 52:39.392
Excuse me.

52:39.826 --> 52:41.428
Do you have a light?

52:49.669 --> 52:50.804
Thanks.

52:56.109 --> 52:58.545
You're from Schleswig-Holstein, too?

52:58.812 --> 53:01.481
- Husum.
- But you don't live there anymore?

53:02.649 --> 53:03.950
No.

53:04.217 --> 53:06.386
My mom and her boyfriend do.

53:16.429 --> 53:18.431
The next time you visit them,

53:20.066 --> 53:21.901
drop by for a coffee.

53:34.848 --> 53:39.419
If you'd known your son did it,
would you still have gone to the police?

53:45.725 --> 53:47.160
I knew.

54:44.284 --> 54:45.919
That's little Fritz.

54:52.926 --> 54:54.127
Come in.

54:59.332 --> 55:00.834
Do you have a tampon?

55:01.668 --> 55:03.169
You have your period already?

55:03.336 --> 55:04.738
Unfortunately.

55:30.663 --> 55:31.998
Keep them.

55:32.665 --> 55:35.368
I haven't had my period since it happened.

55:46.146 --> 55:47.914
How are you making ends meet?

55:48.848 --> 55:50.684
Nuri's life insurance.

55:54.387 --> 55:56.122
How's the trial going?

55:58.525 --> 56:01.528
They'll get their punishment,
I promise you.

56:06.132 --> 56:07.667
Someone's awake!

56:08.902 --> 56:10.704
Do you want some cake, too?

56:11.871 --> 56:13.573
You'll get something even better.

56:19.279 --> 56:20.680
Here you go.

56:29.356 --> 56:31.091
It was good to see you.

56:57.884 --> 57:00.186
The explosive material found at the scene

57:00.353 --> 57:04.424
contained the typical components
of homemade ANFO explosives.

57:04.858 --> 57:09.029
95% ammonium nitrate,
sourced from imported fertilizer,

57:09.195 --> 57:11.197
and 5% diesel.

57:11.364 --> 57:14.534
Did you find enough material
for the analysis?

57:15.101 --> 57:16.369
Yes.

57:16.703 --> 57:17.737
Mr. Fava.

57:18.071 --> 57:23.309
Can we conclude the materials in the
garage match the explosive at the scene?

57:23.943 --> 57:24.944
Yes.

57:25.145 --> 57:27.781
The garage contained traces
of the explosive?

57:27.947 --> 57:31.418
On the garage floor,
traces of an explosive were found

57:31.584 --> 57:35.155
that are identical to those
found at the scene.

57:35.422 --> 57:36.790
So, yes.

57:38.291 --> 57:41.928
Following Mr. Möller's tip-off
and seizure of evidence,

57:42.095 --> 57:45.832
every item
was carefully examined for fingerprints.

57:46.032 --> 57:47.500
What kind of evidence?

57:47.667 --> 57:52.305
Over 700 Black+Decker nails three liters
of diesel in a five-liter can,

57:52.505 --> 57:55.809
50 kg of fertilizer from Israel
and its packaging,

57:55.975 --> 57:58.144
components of a Bosch flashlight

57:58.478 --> 58:01.314
and of a Ninetec drone.

58:01.514 --> 58:06.086
Were all items treated with due care
as potential sources of evidence?

58:06.252 --> 58:09.856
Of course. We collected trace samples
and everything was sealed.

58:10.190 --> 58:12.959
What were the results of fingerprinting?

58:13.426 --> 58:19.699
Fingerprints found on items were analyzed.
We found clear prints of both suspects

58:19.966 --> 58:22.535
and those of witness Jürgen Möller.

58:22.769 --> 58:24.971
Did you find any other fingerprints?

58:25.138 --> 58:28.975
Yes, one more, but
it couldn't be identified.

58:29.743 --> 58:32.078
A further accomplice?

58:33.213 --> 58:35.015
It couldn't be identified.

58:36.483 --> 58:40.653
But the other fingerprint
could have come from a store assistant?

58:40.887 --> 58:42.222
Correct.

58:43.189 --> 58:44.257
Mr. Reetz.

58:46.893 --> 58:48.995
I have a diesel car.

58:49.529 --> 58:52.432
So, I have a can of diesel in my garage.

58:53.266 --> 58:56.002
Sometimes I need nails in my house.

58:56.503 --> 58:58.805
There are nails in my garage.

58:59.339 --> 59:01.708
My wife is a keen gardener,

59:01.908 --> 59:04.711
so there's also a bag of fertilizer.

59:04.911 --> 59:07.681
All these items carry my fingerprints.

59:08.148 --> 59:11.818
Chief Inspector,
would you conclude that I'm a bomb maker?

59:12.919 --> 59:16.556
Mr. Haberbeck, does your garage
contain traces of the explosive

59:16.723 --> 59:18.692
that killed Nuri and Rocco Şekerci?

59:19.025 --> 59:21.761
No, but my key isn't kept under a stone

59:21.995 --> 59:24.030
where anyone can find it.

59:24.230 --> 59:25.331
Thank you.

59:30.403 --> 59:31.938
They'll be punished, right?

59:32.138 --> 59:34.407
I can guarantee you that.

59:37.544 --> 59:38.912
Who or what is Makris?

59:39.079 --> 59:41.281
Haberbeck's new witness from Greece.

59:41.448 --> 59:42.949
Will he be a problem?

59:43.116 --> 59:45.985
I'll fucking shred the bastard,
just watch.

59:58.932 --> 01:00:01.601
The season runs from early May
to mid-November.

01:00:01.968 --> 01:00:03.536
But we're open year-round.

01:00:03.703 --> 01:00:06.773
Guests can visit in the low season, too.

01:00:07.607 --> 01:00:08.708
Mr. Makris,

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:11.077
might you be mistaken?

01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:13.446
Another witness

01:00:13.646 --> 01:00:18.084
claims to have seen my client in Hamburg
at that time.

01:00:31.264 --> 01:00:32.265
Impossible.

01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:34.634
- He's lying!
- I remember them.

01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:38.972
They stayed from October 15th to the 20th.

01:00:39.873 --> 01:00:42.609
It's noted in my booking record.

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:45.812
This one?

01:00:46.613 --> 01:00:47.347
Yes.

01:00:47.947 --> 01:00:49.382
Let's take a look.

01:00:49.883 --> 01:00:51.851
Mr. Makris, can you show us?

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.700
Please sit down.

01:01:09.669 --> 01:01:11.705
Don't you think it's been squeezed in?

01:01:20.113 --> 01:01:22.816
- I'd like to present something.
- Go ahead, Mr. Fava.

01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:36.563
Prosecutor, defense attorneys, please.

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:48.041
Please take a look.

01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:53.113
You can sit down again.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.082
We'll let everyone see.

01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:07.527
Is that you?

01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:11.564
Yes.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.769
What's that symbol?

01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:23.710
The logo of the "Golden Dawn" party.

01:02:24.878 --> 01:02:27.847
For your information,
Golden Dawn is a Greek neo-Nazi party.

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:31.685
It's a democratic party.

01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:34.254
Democratically elected.

01:02:35.121 --> 01:02:37.057
The photo is from 2013

01:02:37.223 --> 01:02:39.426
when your party tried to open
an office in Kassel, Germany.

01:02:40.326 --> 01:02:41.661
It has 160 "likes."

01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:45.165
Let's see who "liked" it.

01:02:59.646 --> 01:03:01.314
They're all in it together.

01:03:01.514 --> 01:03:05.118
A global Nazi network,
all butt-fucking each other.

01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:07.721
- Tell it to the judge.
- About the butt-fucking?

01:03:08.588 --> 01:03:09.789
He knows that.

01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:11.825
You should still tell him.

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:13.059
Follow me.

01:03:16.996 --> 01:03:18.898
What was Edda Möller wearing?

01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:21.801
Gray jeans, brown leather boots.

01:03:22.002 --> 01:03:24.004
Green parka, black wool cap.

01:03:24.504 --> 01:03:26.639
Was she walking from
the left or the right?

01:03:27.007 --> 01:03:29.109
- Right to left.
- Make-up?

01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:31.411
- No make-up.
- Very good.

01:03:32.612 --> 01:03:35.181
Haberbeck will ask about your drug use.

01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:41.721
- What should I say?
- The truth.

01:03:42.822 --> 01:03:44.991
It was to numb your pain.

01:03:46.893 --> 01:03:47.994
Can I say that?

01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:50.697
The police file says they found something.

01:03:50.964 --> 01:03:53.867
I guess it's the stuff I gave you?

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.903
- Shit.
- Forget it.

01:03:57.637 --> 01:04:00.473
If Haberbeck demands a drug test,
we'll refuse.

01:04:00.974 --> 01:04:03.176
Or should we get them high from your hair?

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:11.818
You saw her.

01:04:13.186 --> 01:04:17.023
You told the police. You told the court.
They'll believe you.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.068
Right.

01:04:29.402 --> 01:04:30.403
It's late.

01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:32.539
Get some sleep.

01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:34.474
Tomorrow is showtime.

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:56.896
Do you remember the woman's clothes?

01:04:58.031 --> 01:05:00.133
She was wearing gray jeans,

01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:04.437
brown leather boots,
a green parka and a black wool cap.

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:07.240
Any further details?

01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:10.543
I noticed the bike was new.

01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:12.746
That's why I spoke to her.

01:05:12.946 --> 01:05:17.050
Did you immediately tell police
in a witness statement?

01:05:17.517 --> 01:05:22.756
Yes, I was questioned that evening
and everything was recorded.

01:05:23.189 --> 01:05:26.292
I also helped to create
a facial composite.

01:05:26.726 --> 01:05:27.927
Attorney, go ahead.

01:05:28.728 --> 01:05:29.796
Mrs. Şekerci,

01:05:30.797 --> 01:05:33.800
when you spoke to the woman with the bike,

01:05:34.034 --> 01:05:36.036
how far was she from you?

01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:40.306
Closer than you are.

01:05:40.507 --> 01:05:42.275
Was she leaving the bike?

01:05:42.442 --> 01:05:44.344
She was starting to leave it.

01:05:44.511 --> 01:05:47.147
- You saw her from behind.
- I saw this...

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:52.652
When I spoke to her,
she turned around and looked at me.

01:05:52.852 --> 01:05:54.988
What kind of person was Nuri Şekerci?

01:05:55.689 --> 01:05:58.792
Irrelevant. My client
doesn't have to answer.

01:05:58.992 --> 01:06:00.960
He was a very good person.

01:06:01.327 --> 01:06:04.197
A father and a decent man.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:09.202
Tell us about your husband's priors.

01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:11.771
These priors are known
to police and the court.

01:06:11.971 --> 01:06:13.807
You're holding the file, read it!

01:06:13.973 --> 01:06:15.742
I have read it.

01:06:15.909 --> 01:06:20.513
Nuri Şekerci was caught with 50 kg of hash
and served four years in prison.

01:06:20.747 --> 01:06:21.448
Thank you.

01:06:21.614 --> 01:06:24.984
Nuri Şekerci isn't on trial here.
He's the murder victim.

01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:26.486
Your Honor,

01:06:26.686 --> 01:06:29.856
please ensure
the attorney's questions are relevant.

01:06:30.156 --> 01:06:34.527
After release,
did your husband continue dealing drugs

01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:37.130
or break other drug laws?

01:06:37.831 --> 01:06:38.932
No.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.502
I got pregnant right after his release.

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:45.872
Rocco's birth
was the best thing to ever happen to us.

01:06:46.373 --> 01:06:48.908
Nuri never had anything
to do with drugs again.

01:06:49.075 --> 01:06:53.213
But the police found marijuana,
cocaine and opium in your house.

01:06:53.713 --> 01:06:55.749
My client lost her husband and child.

01:06:55.982 --> 01:06:59.853
Understandably,
she tried to numb her inconceivable pain.

01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:04.491
The quantities were for personal use.
My client need not incriminate herself.

01:07:04.924 --> 01:07:06.393
Mrs. Şekerci,

01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:09.062
are you a drug addict?

01:07:10.663 --> 01:07:11.598
No.

01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:14.401
- Have you taken drugs today?
- No!

01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:16.002
In the past year?

01:07:16.169 --> 01:07:17.470
- No!
- My client...

01:07:17.737 --> 01:07:18.972
On the day of the crime?

01:07:19.305 --> 01:07:21.741
- No!
- My client refuses to answer!

01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:26.846
I request

01:07:27.013 --> 01:07:31.885
that the witness immediately undergo
a drug test and hair analysis

01:07:32.085 --> 01:07:34.821
at the Institute of Forensic Medicine

01:07:34.988 --> 01:07:39.659
in order to verify her perceptive faculty
and fitness to testify

01:07:40.427 --> 01:07:45.565
at the time she allegedly saw
the suspect with the bike. Thank you.

01:07:45.765 --> 01:07:48.902
The co-plaintiff must consent to that.

01:07:49.102 --> 01:07:50.770
Do you consent, Mrs. Şekerci?

01:07:51.771 --> 01:07:55.642
The defense's request is intended
only to discredit the co-plaintiff.

01:07:55.809 --> 01:07:59.479
It's irrelevant to the facts of the crime
and the defendants' guilt.

01:07:59.813 --> 01:08:03.583
Katja Şekerci was a loving, caring mother.

01:08:03.783 --> 01:08:06.753
Her deceased husband
was a model of rehabilitation.

01:08:06.953 --> 01:08:11.291
She has suffered unimaginable pain
for malicious and base reasons.

01:08:11.491 --> 01:08:13.626
She needn't accept this humiliation!

01:08:13.827 --> 01:08:16.962
She will not answer
the defense's defamatory questions.

01:08:17.263 --> 01:08:18.965
Then I'll summarize.

01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:24.069
The witness refuses to undergo
a drug test and psychological examination

01:08:24.304 --> 01:08:30.042
and to answer the defense's questions on
her drug use. There's only one conclusion:

01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:34.247
She wants to prevent
the court from establishing

01:08:34.447 --> 01:08:37.484
that she made her supposed observations

01:08:37.751 --> 01:08:43.456
and, shortly thereafter, her statement,
while under the influence of drugs.

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:45.291
Remember...

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.965
She saw someone walking away
and shouted something after her.

01:08:52.999 --> 01:08:56.002
She claims to have memorized a face

01:08:56.202 --> 01:08:58.505
she saw only for seconds!

01:08:59.038 --> 01:09:01.107
Again, while she was on drugs!

01:09:02.308 --> 01:09:06.379
Her attorney now claims
these drugs were taken later,

01:09:06.546 --> 01:09:10.884
not to enhance
her perceptive or observational skills,

01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:14.187
but "to numb her pain."

01:09:14.654 --> 01:09:17.122
She took them to forget.

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:20.093
But let's not forget one thing.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.130
A witness who was
under the influence of drugs

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:28.100
claims to have seen the accused,
Mrs. Möller, at the scene.

01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:34.107
But as witness Makris stated and confirmed
with the document shown in court,

01:09:34.274 --> 01:09:37.444
she was in fact vacationing in Greece.

01:09:38.178 --> 01:09:39.345
Thank you.

01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:43.649
Go ahead, Mr. Fava.

01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:51.825
Witness Şekerci described a woman

01:09:51.991 --> 01:09:55.562
who left a bike with a top case
at the scene of the explosion.

01:09:55.829 --> 01:09:58.832
She did so before forensics established

01:09:59.032 --> 01:10:01.735
that the top case contained the bomb.

01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:06.873
Forensics confirmed her statement
about the bike,

01:10:07.073 --> 01:10:09.175
that it was new and unlocked,

01:10:09.409 --> 01:10:11.878
and about the top case.

01:10:12.112 --> 01:10:13.713
They also confirmed

01:10:13.913 --> 01:10:17.884
that the woman Mrs. Şekerci described
must be the perpetrator.

01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:22.088
Mrs. Şekerci described this woman
in the same detail

01:10:22.355 --> 01:10:27.093
as the new bike with its top case.
That woman was the accused.

01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:31.498
She's married to the co-accused,
whose garage happened to contain traces

01:10:31.664 --> 01:10:35.068
of the same explosive that blew up
outside Nuri Şekerci's office.

01:10:36.403 --> 01:10:37.671
No drug,

01:10:37.837 --> 01:10:40.507
drug test or psychological examination

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.442
can relativize this fact.

01:10:42.609 --> 01:10:45.612
And anyone who tries to do so
has the same base motives

01:10:45.879 --> 01:10:49.616
as the accused did who murdered
my client's husband and child.

01:10:49.849 --> 01:10:53.486
And it disgusts me
to have to play the defense's game.

01:10:53.653 --> 01:10:54.821
Thank you.

01:11:01.294 --> 01:11:02.562
Order!

01:11:52.812 --> 01:11:55.949
On behalf of the people,
the court returns the following verdict.

01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:58.852
The accused, André Möller and Edda Möller,

01:11:59.019 --> 01:12:00.520
are acquitted.

01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:05.959
Away from each other!

01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:07.327
Fuck this court!

01:12:07.527 --> 01:12:09.662
Behave or I'll clear the room.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:13.900
The state will cover
the trial costs and related expenses.

01:12:14.234 --> 01:12:19.005
The defendants will be compensated
for time spent in detention.

01:12:19.205 --> 01:12:20.674
Please be seated.

01:12:29.015 --> 01:12:32.285
Today's acquittal
is not based on the court's belief

01:12:32.452 --> 01:12:34.454
that the defendants are innocent,

01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:38.525
but that the evidence presented
leaves reasonable doubt as to their guilt.

01:12:38.725 --> 01:12:44.030
Based on the "in dubio pro reo" principle,
this doubt requires that we acquit them.

01:12:44.497 --> 01:12:45.965
The court considered

01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:50.670
that the defendants did not provably
have sole access to the garage.

01:12:50.837 --> 01:12:55.175
Others may have entered.
The key was accessible.

01:12:55.742 --> 01:12:59.245
One set of fingerprints
could not be identified.

01:12:59.879 --> 01:13:03.583
Co-plaintiff Şekerci stated
that she recognized Edda Möller

01:13:03.783 --> 01:13:07.754
as the person she saw at the crime scene.

01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:11.458
We were unable to confirm
the accuracy of her observation.

01:13:12.425 --> 01:13:17.630
The co-plaintiff
exercised her right to refuse examination

01:13:17.897 --> 01:13:21.401
to assess her ability to testify.

01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:47.527
Daddy, can we go in the water?

01:13:48.928 --> 01:13:50.897
- Please.
- Go with Mom.

01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:53.266
I want to go with you.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.968
Go on.

01:13:58.405 --> 01:14:00.640
OK, go, come on!

01:14:13.186 --> 01:14:14.354
Mom, come on!

01:14:14.521 --> 01:14:16.423
No, I just put on sunscreen.

01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:17.857
Come on, Mom!

01:14:18.124 --> 01:14:19.859
- Later.
- Now!

01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:21.695
Please, Mom!

01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:31.171
THE SEA

01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:56.756
TRIAL

01:16:20.113 --> 01:16:22.082
Hotel Old Dream

01:19:41.748 --> 01:19:45.518
FREE AND VACATIONING
AT STATE'S EXPENSE! (2 DAYS AGO)

01:25:41.841 --> 01:25:43.610
She's not here by chance.

01:25:44.611 --> 01:25:49.516
She's playing detective,
looking for evidence on the Greek alibi.

01:25:49.683 --> 01:25:51.885
- Does she know we're here?
- How would she?

01:25:52.118 --> 01:25:54.854
- She found that Greek pig.
- He has a website.

01:25:55.221 --> 01:25:59.159
- Let's go home.
- They'll stick cameras in our faces!

01:25:59.325 --> 01:26:00.660
What if she finds us?

01:26:00.827 --> 01:26:03.730
If that Turk-whore comes near us,
I'll smash her skull!

01:26:03.897 --> 01:26:06.199
I'll put her in the grave with them!

01:32:11.865 --> 01:32:13.233
Hi, Danilo.

01:32:13.933 --> 01:32:15.869
Katja, where are you?

01:32:16.169 --> 01:32:18.238
I've left you 1,000 voice mails.

01:32:20.273 --> 01:32:21.574
I know.

01:32:22.676 --> 01:32:24.210
Let's file an appeal.

01:32:24.411 --> 01:32:27.447
The deadline's tomorrow,
I have to submit the papers.

01:32:32.719 --> 01:32:34.421
I don't want to anymore.

01:32:37.023 --> 01:32:40.894
I know it feels like it's over,
but believe me, it isn't.

01:32:42.529 --> 01:32:45.598
We'll keep going, Katja, we'll keep going.

01:32:46.399 --> 01:32:48.335
We'll get them on an appeal.

01:32:49.402 --> 01:32:52.572
We'll take this to Federal Court.
They'll get life.

01:32:55.508 --> 01:32:57.610
Where are you? I'm coming.

01:33:00.046 --> 01:33:01.548
Grocery shopping.

01:33:03.183 --> 01:33:05.018
Let's meet when you're done.

01:33:06.353 --> 01:33:08.054
No, today's no good.

01:33:11.958 --> 01:33:13.526
Katja, listen to me.

01:33:14.561 --> 01:33:18.264
Come to my office tomorrow
as early as possible. Everything's ready.

01:33:18.465 --> 01:33:21.101
We'll go through the papers together.

01:33:22.736 --> 01:33:24.537
I'll get pastries.

01:33:27.073 --> 01:33:28.641
I need your signature.

01:33:33.813 --> 01:33:35.148
Are you coming?

01:33:40.387 --> 01:33:42.055
Yeah, OK.

01:33:44.024 --> 01:33:45.425
Good.

01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:47.994
Can you be here at eight?

01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:52.332
I can do eight.

01:33:52.832 --> 01:33:54.000
Great.

01:33:54.701 --> 01:33:56.803
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

01:33:57.037 --> 01:33:58.705
See you tomorrow.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.708
See you tomorrow.

01:34:12.686 --> 01:34:14.287
Thanks for everything.

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:19.025
The fight goes on, Katja.

01:34:20.393 --> 01:34:21.561
Bye.

01:34:22.128 --> 01:34:23.396
Bye.

01:35:20.153 --> 01:35:22.355
OK, go, come on!

01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:32.098
Come on, Mom!

01:35:32.265 --> 01:35:34.167
No, I just put on sunscreen.

01:35:34.334 --> 01:35:35.702
Come on, Mom!

01:35:36.002 --> 01:35:37.504
- Later.
- Now!

01:35:37.837 --> 01:35:39.239
Please, Mom.

01:40:38.371 --> 01:40:41.708
BETWEEN 2000 AND 2007 IN GERMANY,
THE "NATIONAL SOCIALIST UNDERGROUND"

01:40:41.875 --> 01:40:44.711
SHOT NINE PEOPLE FROM IMMIGRANT
BACKGROUNDS AND A POLICEWOMAN

01:40:44.878 --> 01:40:46.880
AND CARRIED OUT MULTIPLE BOMBINGS.

01:40:47.047 --> 01:40:50.717
THE SOLE MOTIVE BEHIND THEIR ATTACKS
WAS THEIR VICTIMS' NON-GERMAN ORIGINS.

01:40:51.305 --> 01:40:57.239
