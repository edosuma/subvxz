17:54.970 --> 17:57.421
[water splashing]

17:57.455 --> 17:59.250
- They're definitely
replacing Judy.

18:01.149 --> 18:04.221
- [sighs] So they are.

18:08.052 --> 18:09.812
- Yeah, now it's official.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.127
They're comin' into
town on Sunday.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.164
- Who?

18:16.198 --> 18:17.820
- The guys from headquarters.

18:19.443 --> 18:20.340
They're gonna take
us out to dinner,

18:20.375 --> 18:21.721
make some big announcement.

18:23.343 --> 18:24.344
- Big annou...

18:25.587 --> 18:26.622
Well, does Judy know?

18:28.314 --> 18:29.108
- No.

18:34.285 --> 18:36.218
- Do they know who's
gonna replace her?

18:37.978 --> 18:40.326
- They have some ideas,
but nothing's set.

18:42.051 --> 18:43.225
- Well, is it up to you?

18:44.330 --> 18:45.262
- I have a say.

18:46.366 --> 18:47.988
Some recommendations
I could make.

18:53.477 --> 18:55.099
- You ever think about implants?

18:59.793 --> 19:01.761
[steam hissing]

19:01.795 --> 19:05.696
[lighthearted classical music]

19:08.112 --> 19:10.632
[water splashing]

19:10.666 --> 19:12.668
Did Jacob show up today?

19:21.677 --> 19:22.989
- [Lani] Yes, he was here.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.511
- There's lots of other ways

19:27.545 --> 19:30.376
we could be spending that money.

19:30.410 --> 19:32.171
- I, for one, think we're
spending it the best way.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.517
On paint.

19:33.551 --> 19:35.381
We have to sell this
place, don't we?

19:37.521 --> 19:39.902
Anyway, I could use
a change of scenery.

19:39.937 --> 19:43.803
- [laughing] Oh, please, as if.

19:46.909 --> 19:48.532
I mean, that was
almost believable.

19:50.465 --> 19:52.398
That acting class is
really paying off.

19:56.264 --> 19:59.577
[clock ticking]

19:59.612 --> 20:03.271
[gentle instrumental music]

20:36.787 --> 20:37.650
[glass clinks]

20:37.684 --> 20:38.961
How'd you sleep?

20:38.996 --> 20:41.447
- Ugh, tossed and turned.

20:47.142 --> 20:49.178
- You decide about Jacob?

20:50.318 --> 20:51.491
- Yeah, he can stay.

20:52.423 --> 20:54.218
I want you to watch Lani.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.426
Keep a good eye on her,

20:55.461 --> 20:58.533
better than you've been
doing before, okay?

21:00.431 --> 21:02.261
Do you hear what I'm saying?

21:02.295 --> 21:04.021
- [Tod] Yeah, I hear you.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.298
- I want you to watch her.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.127
I can't watch her
when I'm at work.

21:07.162 --> 21:10.648
[Tod imitates gun firing]

21:14.894 --> 21:17.793
Can't be in two
places at one time.

21:20.727 --> 21:22.142
You're the only one I trust.

21:24.006 --> 21:28.770
[gun firing]
[thudding]

21:45.856 --> 21:48.824
[soft, eerie music]

22:12.400 --> 22:14.885
[splattering]

22:23.203 --> 22:26.517
[Tod breathing heavily]

22:44.259 --> 22:46.503
[coughing]

23:01.759 --> 23:04.279
[eerie music]

23:37.450 --> 23:39.556
- Excuse me.
- Get out, we gotta go.

23:39.590 --> 23:40.971
Judy's really sick.

23:41.005 --> 23:42.144
- What do you mean, she's sick?

23:42.179 --> 23:44.319
- She won't leave her room.
- Why?

23:44.353 --> 23:46.045
- [Tod] Because she's sick,
says she doesn't wanna go.

23:46.079 --> 23:47.736
- Go where?
- I'll tell you in the car.

23:47.771 --> 23:49.082
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

23:49.117 --> 23:50.118
We gotta go.

23:50.152 --> 23:51.602
Can you just get out, please?

23:57.332 --> 24:00.542
- [Lani] Are you gonna
tell me where we're going?

24:00.577 --> 24:02.233
- You're doing the show.
- What?

24:04.650 --> 24:06.272
- [Tod] Judy wants
you to do the show.

24:12.416 --> 24:13.382
- She picked this?

24:15.074 --> 24:16.455
- [Tod] It's what she wants.

24:19.630 --> 24:21.183
- It's one of my favorite ones.

24:22.150 --> 24:24.566
[soft music]

24:45.104 --> 24:46.243
- [Tod] You're gonna be fine.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.762
You've been watching
her for years.

24:47.796 --> 24:49.418
- [Lani] I feel like she just
wants me to be embarrassed.

24:49.453 --> 24:50.972
- No, she wants you
to be great, okay?

24:51.006 --> 24:52.767
She asked for you specifically.

24:52.801 --> 24:53.630
That's no joke.

24:54.562 --> 24:56.080
Just be yourself, okay?

24:56.115 --> 24:57.496
[Lani sighs]

24:57.530 --> 24:58.807
- Where's Judy?
- She's sick.

24:58.842 --> 25:00.464
- What, what do you
mean, she's sick?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.707
- She's sick.

25:01.741 --> 25:03.778
She wants Lani to take
over, just for today.

25:03.812 --> 25:05.055
- What?

25:05.089 --> 25:06.505
- Hey, can you go
straight to hair?

25:06.539 --> 25:08.299
- Wait, no!
- No, go, go, go, go.

25:09.231 --> 25:10.094
- What are you doing?

25:10.129 --> 25:10.957
- She's sick.

25:12.752 --> 25:13.926
Okay, she's not sick.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.892
She's scared if
she loses the show,

25:14.927 --> 25:16.100
her career's over.

25:16.135 --> 25:17.343
- Probably is.

25:17.377 --> 25:18.827
- She's scared she won't
be able to support us.

25:18.862 --> 25:20.070
- So get jobs.

25:20.104 --> 25:22.900
Because it's happening,
she's losing it.

25:22.935 --> 25:25.524
- Well, not if Lani's the
one taking over, am I right?

25:26.525 --> 25:27.974
- So that's what this is about?

25:28.009 --> 25:30.805
- Look, she just asks that
you give her one chance, okay?

25:31.978 --> 25:33.842
- On a rehearsal,
maybe, or a dry run

25:33.877 --> 25:35.085
but not the actual
broadcast, for fuck's sake!

25:35.119 --> 25:36.811
- Look, okay, okay.

25:36.845 --> 25:39.020
If she bombs today,
fine, whatever,

25:39.054 --> 25:40.228
just move on and blame Judy.

25:40.262 --> 25:42.368
But if she's good,
and she will be good,

25:42.402 --> 25:44.612
I promise you she will be good,

25:44.646 --> 25:46.614
then you take the credit
and everybody wins.

25:46.648 --> 25:47.856
- It's a live show, Todd.

25:47.891 --> 25:49.202
- But is anybody watching?

25:50.652 --> 25:53.931
Right, yeah, thought
that was the whole point.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.830
Hey, she might surprise you.

25:55.864 --> 25:57.176
- She's not even
fucking wearing shoes.

25:57.210 --> 26:00.006
- Hey, she's gonna be great.

26:00.041 --> 26:01.732
I tried calling you.

26:01.767 --> 26:04.286
- I have my phone right here.
- Well, you didn't answer it.

26:08.290 --> 26:09.637
No, no, no, no, come on.

26:09.671 --> 26:10.672
No makeup.

26:10.707 --> 26:11.570
She's beautiful.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.469
She's my sister,
and today's her day.

26:16.678 --> 26:18.059
Without the makeup you're
telling the audience,

26:18.093 --> 26:20.613
this is me, this is the truth.

26:21.649 --> 26:22.477
Okay?

26:23.651 --> 26:25.135
If you look right down
the barrel of the lens,

26:25.169 --> 26:26.688
right into their eye

26:26.723 --> 26:28.932
and tell them they
need to have it,

26:28.966 --> 26:30.658
they'll pick up
the phone and call.

26:31.762 --> 26:34.489
- [clapping] Nice speech, Tod.

26:34.523 --> 26:35.973
I'm impressed.

26:36.008 --> 26:36.802
Leave it off.

26:36.836 --> 26:37.665
Let's go.

26:41.254 --> 26:42.083
- Good luck.

26:50.022 --> 26:51.299
- Okay, this is her first day.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.128
We're just gonna
give this a try.

26:53.163 --> 26:54.474
I want you to be wide
for the whole thing

26:54.509 --> 26:57.132
unless you're coming in
to focus on the gloves.

26:57.167 --> 26:58.375
- You sure about that?

26:59.548 --> 27:00.653
Won't shooting it
all in the wide

27:00.688 --> 27:02.655
suggest a lack of
confidence in your host?

27:02.690 --> 27:03.932
- That's exactly
what it'll suggest

27:03.967 --> 27:06.141
but it'll also
hide her mistakes.

27:06.176 --> 27:07.315
- I'd try the opposite.

27:09.455 --> 27:12.147
- I don't fucking care what
you would do, all right?

27:12.182 --> 27:14.115
If there's anything
else, tell me now.

27:15.185 --> 27:16.013
Anything else?

27:17.705 --> 27:19.154
- No.

27:19.189 --> 27:20.017
No.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.814
- [Barb] All right.

27:23.849 --> 27:25.057
If you want, just,

27:25.091 --> 27:27.059
you can stay on the
gloves the whole time.

27:27.093 --> 27:28.577
- And what we have here

27:28.612 --> 27:31.891
are 100% authentic calf
leather gloves from Italy.

27:31.926 --> 27:33.652
They come with a
lifetime warranty.

27:34.825 --> 27:36.620
Not only will we
send you two pairs,

27:36.655 --> 27:39.658
but you will also
get a wooden box

27:39.692 --> 27:41.660
to keep them in to
protect them from the sun.

27:41.694 --> 27:44.386
So remarkably soft, my goodness.

27:45.836 --> 27:48.218
You'll never want your man
to take them off. [laughs]

27:48.252 --> 27:51.600
Can't you just see him
riding around in his Ducati?

27:51.635 --> 27:52.705
Vroom, vroom.

27:54.224 --> 27:57.296
And ladies, if you order now

27:57.330 --> 28:01.645
for the next three minutes
we'll send you two pairs,

28:01.680 --> 28:03.509
so why not get yourself one?

28:03.543 --> 28:06.201
[uptempo music]

28:41.236 --> 28:43.031
We are offering them to you

28:43.066 --> 28:45.482
from the comfort
of your own home,

28:45.516 --> 28:48.209
so that you don't have to
make the trip. [laughs]

28:48.243 --> 28:51.730
They are all leather,
Italian, handmade sewn.

28:53.076 --> 28:55.423
My dear friend, Bobby,
brought these back from Rome

28:55.457 --> 28:57.736
and I just had to bring
them to show to you guys

28:57.770 --> 28:59.530
back in your own homes.

28:59.565 --> 29:01.015
[Tod grunts]

29:01.049 --> 29:02.602
You, too, can feel
like you're riding

29:02.637 --> 29:06.020
your own Ducati through
the tiny streets of Italy.

29:07.193 --> 29:08.677
Aren't they lovely?

29:08.712 --> 29:12.267
They come in such
colors as ox, blood,

29:12.302 --> 29:15.892
chocolate, oh, and this
is really my favorite.

29:16.893 --> 29:18.446
Look at how lovely they are.

29:25.591 --> 29:27.489
- Did you cut yourself?

29:30.838 --> 29:31.666
Lots of blood.

29:35.497 --> 29:36.740
- See something you like?

29:42.608 --> 29:44.092
- I need to close the windows.

29:44.921 --> 29:46.025
It's easier to scrape.

29:49.408 --> 29:50.236
- Sure.

29:51.686 --> 29:53.170
Yeah, all you gotta do is ask.

30:15.641 --> 30:17.850
[scraping]

30:23.614 --> 30:24.443
- Jake.

30:26.721 --> 30:28.240
Jacob.

30:28.274 --> 30:30.863
Hey! [clapping]

30:30.898 --> 30:32.071
I need you to take a break.

30:32.106 --> 30:33.659
- What?

30:33.693 --> 30:35.385
- Yeah, I need you
to go get Lani.

30:38.284 --> 30:39.078
- Why?

30:40.666 --> 30:42.047
- Well, that's
what boyfriends do.

30:42.081 --> 30:44.843
They pick up their girlfriends
in exchange for head.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.952
- [Jacob] I think your
Rolls is blocking me in.

30:55.232 --> 30:56.026
- Take it.

30:56.061 --> 30:57.579
I'll get you the keys.

31:05.277 --> 31:08.280
[suspenseful music]

31:51.737 --> 31:53.014
- [Delivery Man] Hello.

31:53.049 --> 31:55.775
Come on, anybody home?

31:55.810 --> 31:56.949
- Hello?

31:56.984 --> 31:59.055
- Hey, yeah.
- Can I help you?

32:00.090 --> 32:00.988
- [Delivery Man] Uh, yeah.

32:01.022 --> 32:03.266
I got a delivery for Jake.

32:04.163 --> 32:06.200
- He's not--
- No, uh.

32:06.234 --> 32:08.167
Hey, sorry, man,
I can't see you.

32:09.410 --> 32:10.618
You still there?

32:10.652 --> 32:12.516
- Yeah, yeah, I'm down here.

32:13.828 --> 32:15.243
How much is it?

32:15.278 --> 32:16.969
- [Delivery Man]
It's, uh, $15.30.

32:18.453 --> 32:19.868
- Great, okay, hold on.

32:29.878 --> 32:30.707
Oh.

32:31.846 --> 32:32.674
Okay.

32:37.162 --> 32:39.198
Here, that's it, that's a $20.

32:39.233 --> 32:41.649
[can clanks]

32:42.512 --> 32:44.755
Can you leave that in my van,

32:44.790 --> 32:47.689
on top of one of
the, the paint cans?

32:47.724 --> 32:48.794
- [Delivery Man] A'ight.

32:48.828 --> 32:50.451
A'ight dude, thanks.

32:57.285 --> 32:59.978
[birds chirping]

33:15.648 --> 33:17.823
[banging]

34:13.534 --> 34:14.431
- How was it?

34:15.777 --> 34:16.606
How'd you go?

34:17.848 --> 34:19.091
- Ask Barb.

34:19.126 --> 34:19.954
- Why?

34:19.987 --> 34:20.817
What, what did she say?

34:22.094 --> 34:22.922
- Here.

34:24.924 --> 34:25.822
- Thanks.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.272
Oh, your lunch is in the van.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.137
- No, don't, I took care of it.

34:35.831 --> 34:38.145
- Hello?
- We have to meet.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.250
- It'll take more than
looking good, Tod.

34:40.284 --> 34:41.458
The few calls that did come in

34:41.493 --> 34:44.047
basically stopped after
the first half hour.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.737
- [Tod] We actually
liked what she did.

34:45.773 --> 34:46.567
- Who's we?

34:46.601 --> 34:47.844
- Me and Judy.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.293
She wants to give
her another shot.

34:49.328 --> 34:49.984
- Look, it doesn't matter,
I need to talk to her.

34:50.018 --> 34:50.639
Is she there?

34:50.674 --> 34:51.503
Put her on.

34:52.607 --> 34:54.264
- I'll bring her to dinner.
- Fine.

34:54.299 --> 34:56.128
Tonight at the
Tavern, eight o'clock.

34:57.302 --> 34:58.130
Hello?

35:02.100 --> 35:04.343
[cork popping]

35:04.378 --> 35:06.828
[soft music]

35:08.796 --> 35:09.624
- Lani.

35:11.833 --> 35:13.214
Judy's giving you the show.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.252
She wants you to take over.

35:21.947 --> 35:23.500
- Well, according to Barb,

35:23.535 --> 35:25.606
the collars didn't like me.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.505
- So, make them like you.
- How?

35:28.540 --> 35:29.334
- I don't know, act.

35:29.368 --> 35:30.369
Isn't that what you do?

35:34.684 --> 35:36.893
Barb wants to meet us
at the Tavern at 8:00.

35:38.757 --> 35:40.068
You'll discuss tomorrow's show

35:40.103 --> 35:41.346
and then I'll come and meet you.

35:43.934 --> 35:44.763
Here.

35:46.868 --> 35:47.973
- [Lani] You know that
pussy's old enough

35:48.007 --> 35:49.354
to be your mother's right?

35:57.845 --> 35:58.673
- Hm.

36:05.059 --> 36:06.233
[glass clinks]

36:06.267 --> 36:10.513
I think we should drink
champagne more often.

36:10.547 --> 36:15.552
[insects chirping]
[dog barking]

36:17.416 --> 36:19.867
[soft music]

36:34.468 --> 36:37.160
[phone ringing]

36:40.577 --> 36:41.613
Hello?

36:41.647 --> 36:42.855
- [Barb] I said eight o'clock.

36:42.890 --> 36:44.512
- Yeah, I, I'm on my way.

36:44.547 --> 36:45.444
- Your sister's here.

36:45.479 --> 36:46.514
I didn't know she was coming.

36:46.549 --> 36:47.343
- I'm leaving now, okay?

36:47.377 --> 36:48.240
I'm on my way.

36:48.275 --> 36:49.103
- And Judy?

36:51.795 --> 36:52.624
Hello?

37:03.393 --> 37:04.222
- What'd he say?

37:04.256 --> 37:05.292
- He's on his way.

37:07.639 --> 37:10.089
[Barb sighs]

37:11.746 --> 37:14.439
- What are you doing here?
- Lani called me.

37:16.164 --> 37:17.027
- [Tod] She left.

37:18.719 --> 37:20.479
- What's in the bag?

37:20.514 --> 37:22.343
- Nothing, just some laundry.

37:25.726 --> 37:27.245
- Can you tell her I called?

37:30.006 --> 37:30.834
- Maybe.

37:45.401 --> 37:48.507
[footsteps clacking]

37:51.890 --> 37:52.718
Hi.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.411
- Where's Judy?

37:55.445 --> 37:56.964
- [Tod] Uh, she can't make it.

37:58.206 --> 38:00.485
Can you move over?
- No, she goes.

38:05.869 --> 38:06.974
- [Tod] Okay.

38:10.736 --> 38:12.255
- [Lani] Have fun.

38:16.604 --> 38:18.192
- What is it with you two?

38:18.226 --> 38:19.124
- How do you mean?

38:20.470 --> 38:21.506
- [Barb] Entitlement.

38:24.854 --> 38:25.682
- Did you eat?

38:26.925 --> 38:28.133
- Fuck you.

38:28.167 --> 38:29.065
You're a child,
making me sit here

38:29.099 --> 38:30.411
with your sister all night.

38:31.654 --> 38:33.172
- Well, you could've left.

38:34.657 --> 38:39.662
Why didn't you leave?

38:40.145 --> 38:40.973
Hm?

38:42.492 --> 38:44.632
Why didn't you leave, Barb?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.844
- 'Cause I was waiting for you.

38:51.984 --> 38:54.435
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing

38:54.470 --> 38:55.643
or trying to do.

38:55.678 --> 38:58.197
It's not your fault
that Judy won't let go.

38:58.232 --> 38:59.613
It's not your
sister's fault either,

38:59.647 --> 39:01.580
but to force me...

39:01.615 --> 39:05.204
[slow, distorted speech]

39:05.239 --> 39:07.793
[gentle music]

39:15.145 --> 39:20.150
- That was beautiful.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.464
- [sighs] Oh my God,
you're such a dickhead.

39:23.499 --> 39:25.328
- No, Barbie, come, come on.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.881
What are you doing?

39:26.916 --> 39:28.400
Hey.

39:28.435 --> 39:29.815
Come on.

39:29.850 --> 39:32.024
[moaning]

39:36.926 --> 39:39.100
[panting]

39:47.764 --> 39:49.697
- Okay.
- You wanna buy me a drink?

39:49.732 --> 39:50.560
- Uh.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.251
Okay.

39:53.839 --> 39:56.497
I know people here, so.

39:56.532 --> 39:57.395
- Okay.

40:35.985 --> 40:38.401
[soft music]

40:41.162 --> 40:42.440
- [Tour Guide Host]
Up on the left

40:42.474 --> 40:43.993
is the infamous
Bridgehead Mansion,

40:44.027 --> 40:45.822
former home of the late
legendary director,

40:45.857 --> 40:47.410
Igor O'Coolich.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.963
I'm gonna let you guys in

40:48.998 --> 40:51.621
on a little Buddy
Fun Bus Tour secret.

40:51.656 --> 40:55.142
The property is
apparently on the market

40:55.176 --> 40:57.282
so if you've got,
oh, look at this.

40:57.316 --> 41:00.388
It looks like his
grandson, Tod, pulling in.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.701
What a treat.

41:02.736 --> 41:06.153
Up next, where George Clooney
takes his dry cleaning.

41:06.187 --> 41:08.224
You guys ready to see that?

41:08.258 --> 41:10.916
[gate creaking]

41:58.585 --> 42:00.414
- [Tod] Here, let me
give you some light.

42:03.969 --> 42:06.040
- She's not responding.

42:06.075 --> 42:07.697
- That's because she's asleep.

42:07.732 --> 42:09.043
See?

42:09.078 --> 42:10.079
She took some pills.

42:13.082 --> 42:14.566
What, what, hey.

42:14.601 --> 42:15.394
Come on, stop.

42:15.429 --> 42:16.257
You look upset.

42:19.606 --> 42:20.710
She's fine, man.

42:22.401 --> 42:23.195
Really.

42:23.230 --> 42:24.058
She just,

42:25.059 --> 42:26.164
she had a rough night.

42:28.097 --> 42:29.201
Know what that's like?

42:31.894 --> 42:33.551
Have some pills,
get knocked out.

42:37.727 --> 42:41.489
What were you doing
in here, anyway?

42:41.524 --> 42:43.181
- Can't paint the windows
if they're closed.

42:43.215 --> 42:44.078
- Oh, well just say the word

42:44.113 --> 42:45.355
and we'll get them open.

42:45.390 --> 42:47.254
- Well, I tried to knock
but nobody answered.

42:47.288 --> 42:48.393
- Hey, check this out.

42:50.015 --> 42:50.809
Right?

42:50.844 --> 42:51.638
How sweet is that?

42:51.672 --> 42:52.500
- You threw me a gun?

42:53.640 --> 42:54.882
- It's an antique.

42:54.917 --> 42:57.367
My grandpa brought
it over from Russia.

42:57.402 --> 42:59.024
- And why, why
would you do that?

42:59.991 --> 43:01.026
- Ever since he died,

43:01.061 --> 43:02.372
she keeps it beside her bed.

43:02.407 --> 43:04.789
I don't know, I guess
it makes her feel safe.

43:04.823 --> 43:06.514
- No, why would
you throw me a gun?

43:06.549 --> 43:07.308
I mean, it could've been,

43:07.343 --> 43:08.240
it could be loaded.

43:08.275 --> 43:09.517
- Shit, it could be loaded!

43:11.243 --> 43:13.383
[laughs] No one's
loaded it in years.

43:14.350 --> 43:15.869
- How do you know?

43:15.903 --> 43:16.939
- 'Cause I know Judy.

43:19.182 --> 43:20.114
It's just for show.

43:27.708 --> 43:28.571
Shh.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.924
[Tod sighs]

43:37.856 --> 43:39.478
You're lucky she
likes her pills.

43:40.928 --> 43:42.861
Going in her room
like that, uninvited.

43:45.381 --> 43:47.417
Don't let her catch
you doing that again.

43:52.595 --> 43:55.598
[suspenseful music]

44:15.411 --> 44:18.069
[phone beeping]

44:23.833 --> 44:27.216
- [911 Operator] 911,
what is your emergency?

44:27.250 --> 44:28.079
Hello?

44:30.737 --> 44:31.876
Are you there?

44:33.843 --> 44:35.431
How can I help you?

44:37.571 --> 44:39.090
Hello?

44:39.124 --> 44:41.644
[phone beeps]

44:50.757 --> 44:53.069
[splashing]

45:10.017 --> 45:12.399
[easygoing music]

45:12.433 --> 45:13.538
- Come on in.

45:18.681 --> 45:21.477
[Hallie shrieks]

45:21.511 --> 45:25.930
- [Hallie] Hey!
[laughing]

45:25.964 --> 45:29.796
[speech drowned out by music]

45:52.025 --> 45:53.647
- That kick really hurt.

45:54.993 --> 45:56.892
- It's your fault
for pulling me in.

45:58.617 --> 45:59.791
- Tell that to my kids

45:59.826 --> 46:01.931
when they come out
with two heads.

46:01.966 --> 46:03.830
[both laugh]

46:03.864 --> 46:05.452
- Who are you having kids with?

46:06.833 --> 46:08.317
- You.

46:08.351 --> 46:10.491
[Hallie laughs]

46:10.526 --> 46:12.804
- I'm serious, it's
on my vision board.

46:12.839 --> 46:13.667
- Your what?

46:15.462 --> 46:17.291
What's a vision board?

46:27.439 --> 46:28.924
What is it?

46:28.958 --> 46:30.995
- It's all the things
I hope come true.

46:32.513 --> 46:33.687
Stuff I want this year.

46:35.344 --> 46:36.207
- Have any?

46:39.279 --> 46:40.107
- Some.

46:41.660 --> 46:44.111
This is grandpa and me.

46:46.907 --> 46:48.771
And, uh, see?

46:48.806 --> 46:51.981
- What, that's us?
- It could be.

46:52.016 --> 46:54.190
We just need to tape
our faces over theirs.

46:58.091 --> 46:58.919
- Tod!

47:02.785 --> 47:04.925
Tod, it went great.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.375
People actually called in today.

47:06.409 --> 47:09.102
- Well, that, that's great!
- I know!

47:09.136 --> 47:09.930
- It is great.

47:09.965 --> 47:11.035
The guys just called.

47:11.069 --> 47:12.243
They want you to come to dinner.

47:12.277 --> 47:13.485
You too, Tod.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.762
- Why me?

47:14.797 --> 47:17.282
- To thank you for
being so helpful.

47:17.317 --> 47:18.145
Who's this?

47:21.045 --> 47:22.425
- Hallie, this is Barb.

47:22.460 --> 47:23.737
She produces Judy's show.

47:27.223 --> 47:28.052
- Pool warm?

47:29.432 --> 47:30.813
- Uh, yeah.

47:34.299 --> 47:35.404
- Well, I guess we now know

47:35.438 --> 47:37.337
why Lani needed a ride home.

47:37.371 --> 47:38.200
Where's Judy?

47:43.999 --> 47:47.278
- The cops are here.

47:47.312 --> 47:48.141
- For you?

47:50.453 --> 47:52.110
[laughs] I was just kidding.

47:52.145 --> 47:54.112
What are the cops here for?

47:54.147 --> 47:55.251
What the fu...

48:01.809 --> 48:03.259
Can I help you?

48:03.294 --> 48:05.192
- Is everything okay here, sir?

48:05.227 --> 48:07.298
- [Tod] Yeah, I think so, why?

48:07.332 --> 48:08.161
- A 911 call.

48:09.334 --> 48:11.405
- [laughs] I'm sorry.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.476
My, uh, my grandmother's
an actress.

48:13.511 --> 48:15.582
As you can imagine, she
can be very dramatic.

48:15.616 --> 48:18.481
She does things like
this to make us worry.

48:18.516 --> 48:19.897
- [Officer] And is she here?

48:20.794 --> 48:22.002
- Well, that's my point.

48:22.037 --> 48:23.831
She probably made
the call and left.

48:24.971 --> 48:27.490
She must've left when
I was in the pool.

48:27.525 --> 48:28.422
The painter might have seen her.

48:28.457 --> 48:29.803
He's got all the best views.

48:29.837 --> 48:30.700
Hey, Jake.

48:32.771 --> 48:34.014
Did you see Judy leave?

48:36.120 --> 48:36.948
- No.

48:38.777 --> 48:39.813
- [Tod] Are you sure?

48:43.334 --> 48:45.508
- [Officer] Does she
have a cell phone?

48:45.543 --> 48:47.407
- [Tod] Uh, yeah, she does.

48:47.441 --> 48:48.649
It's me, usually.

48:48.684 --> 48:50.375
I handle all her
personal affairs.

48:51.998 --> 48:53.654
- Whenever she gets
back, she should call us

48:53.689 --> 48:55.104
so we can mark it
as a false alarm.

48:55.139 --> 48:56.623
- Yeah, of course, of course.

48:56.657 --> 48:59.557
Oh, and hey, sorry, I'm so
sorry for wasting your time.

48:59.591 --> 49:00.834
- No problem.

49:00.868 --> 49:01.973
- [Tod] And drive safe.

49:05.666 --> 49:08.324
[engine igniting]

49:08.359 --> 49:11.879
[soft, suspenseful music]

49:20.716 --> 49:23.029
- Where'd she go?
- How should I know?

49:24.202 --> 49:26.239
- She doesn't tell you
when she's leaving?

49:26.273 --> 49:27.481
- [laughing] Yeah,
usually she has to.

49:27.516 --> 49:29.104
I'm the one that takes her.

49:29.138 --> 49:30.312
I, I don't know.

49:30.346 --> 49:32.003
I guess she, I guess
she took a cab.

49:33.108 --> 49:34.523
- Well, we need to find her.

49:35.662 --> 49:37.284
- Maybe she doesn't
wanna be found.

49:39.010 --> 49:41.323
- Tod, she has to
be at that dinner.

49:41.357 --> 49:43.463
- Well, I bet that's
exactly why she left.

49:44.636 --> 49:46.086
Listen, we were
just about to eat.

49:47.156 --> 49:48.433
You wanna join us?

49:48.468 --> 49:49.572
I made sandwiches.

49:53.783 --> 49:54.612
- No.

49:57.546 --> 49:59.341
[sighs] Enjoy your sandwich.

50:03.759 --> 50:04.587
- What?

50:06.072 --> 50:07.314
I wasn't trying to be mean.

50:07.349 --> 50:09.282
It looks like she
doesn't even care.

50:09.316 --> 50:11.870
- I don't believe that.

50:11.905 --> 50:13.079
- This is Judy's life,

50:13.113 --> 50:14.666
and all she thinks
about is that show.

50:17.083 --> 50:18.808
- I just think she
still likes you.

50:22.019 --> 50:22.881
- Come to dinner.

50:24.090 --> 50:24.952
Be my date.

50:25.815 --> 50:26.885
Um, I'm so sorry.

50:26.920 --> 50:27.955
Judy sends her regards.

50:27.990 --> 50:29.026
She couldn't make it.

50:31.718 --> 50:32.581
- Lucky you.

50:32.615 --> 50:34.479
[laughing]

50:34.514 --> 50:36.447
We certainly underestimated
the intelligence

50:36.481 --> 50:38.000
of our audience.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.657
- Who knew that
they'd appreciate

50:39.691 --> 50:41.279
a hot girl in a vintage dress.

50:41.314 --> 50:42.246
[laughing]

50:42.280 --> 50:43.316
- Instead of a vintage actress.

50:43.350 --> 50:44.593
- Well, we like what we see,

50:44.627 --> 50:45.904
so what we want you
to keep doin' it.

50:45.939 --> 50:46.871
- Yeah.

50:46.905 --> 50:47.837
Today's call center numbers

50:47.872 --> 50:49.391
were the best we had in months.

50:49.425 --> 50:50.357
- Yeah.

50:50.392 --> 50:51.669
Which is not saying much,

50:51.703 --> 50:53.740
considering they've
been in the toilet.

50:53.774 --> 50:55.535
- Well, key word
there being been.

50:55.569 --> 50:57.088
[laughing]

50:57.123 --> 50:59.435
- All I can say is, what
if today was a fluke?

51:00.471 --> 51:02.507
I mean--
- Actually, um...

51:04.509 --> 51:05.717
- What?
- No, never mind.

51:05.752 --> 51:06.615
Go ahead.

51:06.649 --> 51:07.857
- Spit it out.

51:07.892 --> 51:09.100
- [Tod] Well, it's
just a thought.

51:09.135 --> 51:09.928
- And we like thoughts.

51:09.963 --> 51:10.964
So does Barb.

51:13.139 --> 51:14.864
Especially when
they're good ones.

51:18.144 --> 51:20.111
- Well, I think we
should be confident

51:20.146 --> 51:21.457
about the fact that
this is the start

51:21.492 --> 51:23.114
of something epic and new.

51:23.149 --> 51:25.737
- And it could be.
- No, it is.

51:25.772 --> 51:27.739
- [Executive] [laughs] That's
the kind of attitude we need

51:27.774 --> 51:29.224
with the [mumbles].

51:29.258 --> 51:31.674
- And shouldn't Lani have
a say in what she wears?

51:32.813 --> 51:34.125
Still from Judy's
closet, but picked out

51:34.160 --> 51:35.264
by the host herself.

51:36.472 --> 51:37.301
- Tod.

51:40.062 --> 51:41.236
I'm sitting right here.

51:41.270 --> 51:42.892
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

51:44.549 --> 51:47.518
[soft, tense music]

51:50.831 --> 51:51.625
- Um...

51:53.040 --> 51:54.801
[laughs] Sorry.

51:54.835 --> 51:56.216
Uh, I'm gonna use the restroom.

51:56.251 --> 51:57.079
Excuse me.

52:10.196 --> 52:13.199
[phone ringing]

52:13.233 --> 52:14.683
Hello?

52:14.717 --> 52:16.719
No, no, I can't...

52:16.754 --> 52:18.721
I'm sorry, that was
fucking, that was bullshit.

52:18.756 --> 52:20.378
She can't do...

52:20.413 --> 52:21.655
I'm not a fucking child!

52:21.690 --> 52:24.002
Like, no, I'm not coming back.

52:24.037 --> 52:25.763
Can you just, can you call,

52:25.797 --> 52:28.352
call Jacob to give you
a ride or something?

52:28.386 --> 52:31.009

Oh!

57:11.945 --> 57:14.223
[thudding]

57:16.950 --> 57:18.020
- What are you doing?

57:20.575 --> 57:22.680
- I was looking for the cat.

57:22.715 --> 57:24.924
He, uh, he got out when I left.

57:30.377 --> 57:31.171
Let me get changed.

57:31.206 --> 57:32.345
I'll give you a ride.

57:32.379 --> 57:33.657

58:26.710 --> 58:27.538
- What's up?

58:28.712 --> 58:30.127
- Your hand on my leg.

58:31.266 --> 58:32.370
You wanted her to see.

58:35.132 --> 58:36.582
- So what if I did?

58:38.584 --> 58:41.241
- [Hallie] I thought you
didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

58:42.242 --> 58:43.071
- Maybe now I do.

58:46.212 --> 58:47.558
[lighter clicks]

58:47.593 --> 58:50.181
- Well, I don't like being used.

58:50.216 --> 58:51.113
- I won't use you.

58:52.943 --> 58:54.323
No being used, no drama.

58:58.086 --> 58:59.674
How about I help you instead?

59:03.816 --> 59:04.989
- Help me how?

59:38.298 --> 59:40.991
- [Lani] Why do you always
have to perv on my friends?

59:43.372 --> 59:44.201
- Nice choice.

59:45.064 --> 59:46.617
- [Lani] Yeah, I think so, too.

59:46.652 --> 59:47.929
I mean, you picked it out--

59:47.963 --> 59:49.137
- Fuck!
- What?

59:49.171 --> 59:50.000
- Gardener.

59:52.243 --> 59:53.072
Hi.

59:54.176 --> 59:55.384
You're early.

59:55.419 --> 59:57.007
[gardener speaks in
foreign language]

59:57.041 --> 59:57.904
- Lost some clients.

59:57.939 --> 01:00:00.458
Uh, is that a problem?

01:00:00.493 --> 01:00:01.390
- Uh, not really.

01:00:01.425 --> 01:00:02.633
It's just, I have to go.

01:00:02.668 --> 01:00:04.497
- [Gardener] Well,
that's all right.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.672
- No, it's, it's not.

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:09.571
- So then, what?

01:00:10.848 --> 01:00:12.816
You want me to come back?

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.231
- Is that all right?

01:00:14.265 --> 01:00:16.095
- [laughs] Do I have
a choice, señor?

01:00:17.959 --> 01:00:20.409
- I guess not, if you don't
wanna lose another client.

01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:23.516
- No problem, señor.

01:00:39.221 --> 01:00:41.707

- What, why?

01:00:41.741 --> 01:00:43.191
What happened?

01:00:43.225 --> 01:00:46.919
- Until Jacob's done, the
garden can be left alone, okay?

01:00:46.953 --> 01:00:49.266
So can you, you
can take the car.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.785
Can you drop Hallie off?

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:52.234
And, um, have a great show--

01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:54.685
- Yeah, but you're
being very weird.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.755
- I'm not being weird.

01:00:56.929 --> 01:00:57.861
Are you nervous?

01:00:58.965 --> 01:00:59.897
Don't be nervous.

01:00:59.932 --> 01:01:02.520
Hey, you're gonna be great.

01:01:02.555 --> 01:01:04.005
Break a leg, all right?

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:07.008

01:04:41.532 --> 01:04:42.326
- Do you mind?

01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:43.396
I had to be somewhere.

01:04:43.431 --> 01:04:44.673
- [Jacob] You should ask.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:49.609
- I tried, but your headphones.

01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:53.993
- How'd you know where
to find the keys?

01:04:56.823 --> 01:04:58.895
[laughs]

01:05:00.482 --> 01:05:02.933

don't you think?

01:05:02.968 --> 01:05:05.246
- No, I don't.

01:05:09.422 --> 01:05:10.596

you're welcome to
take it up with Judy.

01:05:24.196 --> 01:05:25.922
I thought you said
it was never loaded.

01:05:28.027 --> 01:05:29.132
- I guess I was wrong.

01:05:30.996 --> 01:05:31.858
No, keep it.

01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:36.725

with the gloves?

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.591
- Oh, I like 'em.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:41.868
Feel like I'm James Hunt.

Do you know James Hunt?

01:05:43.663 --> 01:05:44.492
He was very famous.

01:05:46.183 --> 01:05:47.426

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.773
Probably too classy for you.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:53.742

- Who?

01:05:53.777 --> 01:05:54.571

Do me a favor.

We're gonna be switching

up, like, 30 minutes later.

Come, come right in.

This way.
- Okay.

01:09:03.484 --> 01:09:04.933
- What happened to your face?

01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:08.109
- It was Jake.

01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:11.354
I don't know why.

01:09:12.424 --> 01:09:14.426
- You must've done
something to upset him.

01:09:16.738 --> 01:09:18.256
- [Tod] Has he ever hit you?

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:21.571
- [laughing] No.

He barely even talks.

- [Tod] He talks to me.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:29.198
- Only because you hired him.

01:09:30.613 --> 01:09:32.788
Other than that, he thinks
you're pretty strange.

01:09:36.033 --> 01:09:36.965
- I'm not strange.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.761
- Yes, you are.

01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:40.796
You threw him a gun.

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:46.872
- Judy's gun.

01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:49.875
You threw it at him
and told him to catch.

01:09:52.153 --> 01:09:54.845
- Who the fuck plays
catch with a gun?

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.433
- [Lani] You're so full of shit.

01:09:58.124 --> 01:09:58.918

01:09:58.953 --> 01:09:59.850
How does he even know

01:09:59.885 --> 01:10:00.989
that gun exists?
- Tod, Tod.

01:10:01.024 --> 01:10:02.336

through Judy's stuff?

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:03.199
- Don't.

- Can we go somewhere,

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.476
can we go somewhere private?

01:10:44.619 --> 01:10:46.690

01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:48.209
Somebody get to you before me?
