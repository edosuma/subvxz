[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

02:23.683 --> 02:26.218
I'm always telling you that's the problem.
That is the problem.

02:26.326 --> 02:28.568
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

02:37.113 --> 02:38.864
Well if you don't believe in God, Brandon,

02:38.865 --> 02:41.450
then how do you explain
the creation of the universe?

02:41.451 --> 02:43.952
How do you explain the creation of God?

02:43.953 --> 02:46.580
- He's always existed.
- So has the universe.

02:46.581 --> 02:47.615
Bullshit.

02:48.499 --> 02:52.336
Why? Why is that harder
to accept than an infinite God?

02:52.337 --> 02:56.006
There is no way that intelligent
life could have formed so quickly

02:56.007 --> 02:58.317
without some kind of divine intervention.

02:58.885 --> 03:01.602
Come on, Roger,
now you can't honestly count someone

03:01.603 --> 03:04.333
like Jim here as intelligent life, can you?

03:04.682 --> 03:09.682
That's good. I'm impressed, Brandon.
I mean, that's almost witty.

03:12.357 --> 03:13.667
Almost.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.065
I'm gonna get another drink.

03:17.654 --> 03:19.746
Like father, like son, huh?

03:28.498 --> 03:31.746
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

03:35.046 --> 03:37.166
- Michael, I'm waiting.
- Okay.

03:37.715 --> 03:39.463
How does he do this?

03:40.885 --> 03:42.177
Speak of the devil.

03:42.178 --> 03:45.355
Don't. I've had enough
religious discussion for one night.

03:45.848 --> 03:46.682
What?

03:46.683 --> 03:49.632
- When did you guys get here?
- Just walked in, man.

03:50.103 --> 03:52.979
What, are you leaving me out there
with Lyndon's, uh, law school chum?

03:52.980 --> 03:55.540
- Sorry.
- Priorities, man.

03:56.025 --> 04:00.028
Jack first, hello second.
Whatcha drinkin'?

04:00.029 --> 04:02.383
Whatever's handy.

04:03.783 --> 04:06.410
Hey, Jim, look everybody
is kind of fancy out there.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.704
You sure we're not a little under dressed?

04:08.705 --> 04:11.754
No, man, I think
they're a little overdressed.

04:12.132 --> 04:13.327
Yeah, right.

04:15.044 --> 04:18.547
Speaking of which, who's the guy
in the eight hundred dollar suit?

04:18.548 --> 04:23.237
- That's Brandon Sinclair.
- Of the Sinclair Vineyards?

04:23.803 --> 04:24.928
Mhm.

04:24.929 --> 04:28.432
- Linda used to date him.
- I'm impressed.

04:28.933 --> 04:30.048
So's he.

04:30.935 --> 04:32.076
Jealous?

04:33.980 --> 04:38.650
Jim? Hi, Lloyd. Hi, Mike.

04:38.651 --> 04:39.861
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:41.154 --> 04:43.959
Well, I guess
we'll go rinse out some things.

04:45.074 --> 04:46.750
Sorry. Excuse me.

04:53.499 --> 04:54.877
Are you alright?

04:57.211 --> 04:58.956
I told you he was an asshole.

04:59.881 --> 05:01.655
I know you did.

05:04.093 --> 05:06.137
You gonna come back out to the party?

05:07.722 --> 05:08.958
In a minute.

05:12.059 --> 05:14.561
Look, can you just
go play hostess, you know?

05:14.562 --> 05:17.233
Try to come up with some clean jokes, okay?

05:18.941 --> 05:19.950
Okay.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.431
Jim.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.260
I love you.

05:33.623 --> 05:35.031
I know.

05:57.772 --> 06:01.483
How can you believe in spirits
if you don't believe in God or Satan?

06:01.484 --> 06:03.758
There's been evidence of their existence.

06:04.153 --> 06:06.321
Eyewitness accounts, photographs,

06:06.322 --> 06:08.651
recordings, you name it.

06:08.908 --> 06:10.949
And I've contacted some of them.

06:11.035 --> 06:12.841
With what, a wee-gee board?

06:13.037 --> 06:15.038
- Ouija.
- What?

06:15.039 --> 06:17.565
It's pronounced, "Ouija," not "wee-gee."

06:17.834 --> 06:23.124
It comes from the French and German
words for yes: "Oui" and "Ja." Ouija.

06:24.173 --> 06:26.909
And this is a planchette.

06:28.010 --> 06:30.079
I don't care what you call it, dude.

06:30.158 --> 06:32.871
It's just like a game.
Like checkers, or chess.

06:33.015 --> 06:35.392
For your information, "dude,"
the Ouija board

06:35.393 --> 06:37.435
has been around since recorded history.

06:37.436 --> 06:41.296
It was in wide use as far back as 540 B.C.

06:41.941 --> 06:43.942
I guess if Barbie dolls had been around

06:43.943 --> 06:46.111
for that long you'd be talking to them too.

06:46.112 --> 06:48.381
- [LAUGHING]
- Beats talking to you.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.533
Well, that's because I use words
with more than one syllable.

06:51.534 --> 06:53.410
Oh, would you like to talk about that?

06:53.411 --> 06:55.612
- Yeah.
- Um, look, guys...

06:56.122 --> 06:59.020
Can we play a bit of the game?
That would be fun.

06:59.792 --> 07:00.959
Alright.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.936
Now, for the best results,

07:02.960 --> 07:05.452
the Ouija should be used by two people,

07:05.453 --> 07:07.225
preferably a man and a woman.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.233
And it shouldn't be sitting on a table.

07:09.234 --> 07:12.721
It should sit on our knees so that
there's as much body contact as possible.

07:12.722 --> 07:17.434
Also, the two people
should have clean, pure systems,

07:17.435 --> 07:19.936
so that the energy flowing through us to the

07:19.937 --> 07:22.188
planchette is as strong as it can be.

07:22.189 --> 07:26.384
Are you saying that the spirits
actually come through our bodies?

07:26.903 --> 07:28.823
Oh, don't worry. It's perfectly safe.

07:29.238 --> 07:31.031
I don't think I quite understand what you

07:31.032 --> 07:32.808
mean by a clean system, though.

07:33.075 --> 07:37.808
Someone who doesn't
smoke or drink, like you.

07:39.582 --> 07:41.108
Care to give it a try?

07:41.667 --> 07:43.960
No, I don't think so...

07:43.961 --> 07:48.680
[TOGETHER]
Come on, come on. Jeez,
just give it a try. Come on!

07:49.133 --> 07:51.839
- Alright.
- Alright, good. Alright!

07:52.720 --> 07:57.015
Good. I don't smoke either,
and I haven't been drinking tonight.

07:57.475 --> 08:01.192
So together, we should
be able to make a clear, strong contact.

08:05.942 --> 08:08.487
I'll bet he wants a clear, strong contact.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.115
Alright, one more thing before we begin.

08:13.157 --> 08:16.618
The spirits are lousy spellers
and a lot of them like to lie.

08:16.619 --> 08:20.400
So just to play it safe,
I'm gonna try to contact David.

08:20.498 --> 08:23.398
The spirit of a little boy
who died about thirty years ago.

08:24.543 --> 08:27.031
You mean you've actually
talked to this spirit before?

08:27.296 --> 08:29.297
Yeah, I've contacted him several times.

08:29.298 --> 08:32.133
For some reason he is connected
to this particular board.

08:32.134 --> 08:33.181
Why's that?

08:33.427 --> 08:36.136
Well, I don't know, really.
It's just that every Ouija

08:36.138 --> 08:38.390
board seems to have
its own dominant spirit.

08:38.390 --> 08:41.784
Maybe it's because this board
was made the day David died.

08:42.144 --> 08:44.479
How do you know when that board was made?

08:44.897 --> 08:46.447
David told me.

08:46.816 --> 08:48.610
How do you know he wasn't lying?

08:48.611 --> 08:51.916
You said they liked to lie.
Didn't you say that?

08:52.655 --> 08:56.658
Uh, I'd really like to try this.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.088
Alright.

09:06.210 --> 09:11.644
David. Are you here?
Can you hear me?

09:20.474 --> 09:24.101
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah, go ahead.

09:26.605 --> 09:28.406
How old are you, David?

09:30.151 --> 09:31.943
Uh, thank you very much. Goodbye.

09:31.944 --> 09:34.029
- Why did you stop?
- Oh, that wasn't David.

09:34.030 --> 09:36.740
- Well then who was it?
- I don't know.

09:36.741 --> 09:38.567
Like I said, they like to lie sometimes.

09:39.365 --> 09:41.139
How do you know it wasn't David?

09:41.184 --> 09:43.788
Well, David was ten when he died, not eight.

09:43.789 --> 09:47.083
Besides, we have a special signal
that no other spirit knows.

09:47.084 --> 09:49.461
Ooh. That's a little spooky.

09:49.462 --> 09:52.391
- It's a little stupid.
- It's a lot stupid.

10:01.057 --> 10:03.403
David, can you hear me?

10:04.894 --> 10:07.117
Would you like to talk to us?

10:11.901 --> 10:13.736
David, is that you?

10:20.576 --> 10:25.036
- It's doing a figure eight.
- That's David's signal.

10:26.165 --> 10:27.918
Would you like to speak to him?

10:28.918 --> 10:30.641
Yeah, I would.

10:32.338 --> 10:33.625
David?

10:36.801 --> 10:38.774
I don't know what to say to him.

10:39.678 --> 10:42.717
David. Do you know me?

10:48.354 --> 10:51.197
David, will you return
to the living one day?

10:54.443 --> 10:57.523
- Reincarnation?
- That's what they all say.

10:58.948 --> 11:00.005
David.

11:00.741 --> 11:04.238
Will you be able to choose
your parents when you return?

11:05.210 --> 11:06.475
Yes.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.104
Bullshit.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.917
Why?
You can't believe you were stupid

11:10.918 --> 11:12.525
enough to pick your parents?

11:13.504 --> 11:15.491
Hey, I don't talk to cardboard.

11:16.423 --> 11:20.218
- Careful, Jim, you're upsetting David.
- What's he gonna do, haunt me?

11:20.219 --> 11:21.636
David, are you all right?

11:21.637 --> 11:24.472
He's alright.
He's just a little dead, that's all.

11:24.473 --> 11:27.862
Shut up, Jim!
David, are you all right?

11:28.394 --> 11:30.645
Brandon, it's really racing.

11:30.646 --> 11:33.836
Yeah, maybe he's late
for the last flight back to limbo.

11:49.957 --> 11:53.545
- What was that noise?
- Sounded like a gunshot.

11:53.627 --> 11:55.747
'Scuse me, folks. Pardon me.

11:57.882 --> 12:02.594
Oh, man, multiple sadness.
Who owns the red Cobra?

12:02.595 --> 12:05.651
- I do, why?
- Your tires are history, bud.

12:12.646 --> 12:13.938
Thanks a lot, Morar.

12:13.939 --> 12:17.317
- What? This is my fault?
- Those were brand new tires!

12:17.318 --> 12:18.868
Now how do you explain it?

12:20.112 --> 12:22.989
I don't know man,
maybe your buddy Casper did it.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.853
That's right.
Because you made him angry.

12:26.535 --> 12:28.863
Then why didn't he flatten my tire?

12:28.954 --> 12:32.693
Why? Because I was in control
of the board, he held me responsible.

12:33.167 --> 12:35.133
- You're crazy.
- You're drunk.

12:35.461 --> 12:39.631
And you're a loser.
In the great family tradition.

12:40.820 --> 12:41.847
Jim!

12:43.280 --> 12:44.226
Jim.

13:00.861 --> 13:04.304
Well thank you very much
for ruining the party.

13:07.284 --> 13:10.417
You're welcome.
But don't worry.

13:12.456 --> 13:14.421
The night's still young.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.759
Are you serious?

13:16.919 --> 13:20.129
Look at me.
I am furious with you right now.

13:20.130 --> 13:24.046
I know. And you're so gorgeous
when you're angry.

13:24.093 --> 13:27.637
Look. Don't joke
when you're this close to death.

13:27.638 --> 13:32.926
Okay, okay. I'm sorry about
the party and I'm sorry about Brandon.

13:34.645 --> 13:37.617
And I'm sorry about
the crisis in the Middle East.

13:38.565 --> 13:40.512
Alright. That's it.

13:41.535 --> 13:43.120
Come on, come on.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.863
You knew you were taking a chance
when you invited him.

13:49.326 --> 13:54.060
I know your heart was in the right place.
It just didn't work out.

13:55.833 --> 13:59.460
Jim, you promised me that you
weren't gonna start anything with him.

13:59.461 --> 14:01.128
I kept my promise.

14:01.839 --> 14:03.363
He started it.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.353
What did you want me to do?

14:09.138 --> 14:11.035
Just sit there and take it?

14:17.771 --> 14:20.888
No, I guess not.

14:21.317 --> 14:23.000
I really am sorry.

14:25.654 --> 14:27.127
I know.

14:55.351 --> 14:58.644
- Why do I love you so much?
- 'Cause I make you laugh.

14:58.645 --> 15:00.900
Yeah? And Woody Allen makes me laugh.

15:01.315 --> 15:03.346
I know, but I'm sexier.

[WHISTLING]

15:47.027 --> 15:48.615
Whatcha doing?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.821
I lost my hammer.

15:54.368 --> 15:55.917
Use mine.

16:00.249 --> 16:02.228
Sucker, you could have killed me.

16:03.585 --> 16:07.839
Nah, then you'd come back and haunt me
and flatten my tires and stuff.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.321

choose your next parents?

So that she's lured into using
the board more and more.

39:50.719 --> 39:53.317
Pretty soon all she wants to do
is use the board.

39:53.556 --> 39:57.090
Everything else,
like going to classes, becomes unimportant.

39:59.019 --> 40:01.279
This is called progressive entrapment.

the spirit changes.

40:09.989 --> 40:12.776
Gradually breaking down her resistance.

he's able to possess her.

Look, I'm not saying that it's a demon.

40:40.936 --> 40:42.937
Just the spirit of someone evil.

40:42.938 --> 40:46.184
Evil when he was alive
and evil now that he's dead.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.153
I want to bring a medium
by your apartment

40:59.872 --> 41:02.540
How do you think I knew
all those things about Linda?

41:02.541 --> 41:06.031
Those are all symptoms of
progressive entrapment.

41:06.754 --> 41:09.656
They're also all symptoms of pregnancy.

41:10.674 --> 41:11.845

41:12.468 --> 41:13.966
Linda's pregnant.

41:14.178 --> 41:16.063
I'm going to be a father.

41:17.848 --> 41:19.103
Terrific.

41:20.309 --> 41:24.648
Come on, Brandon.
I mean, can't you be happy for us?

41:27.024 --> 41:28.667
You gonna marry her?

41:31.070 --> 41:32.355
Yeah.

41:32.863 --> 41:34.146
Of course.

41:35.658 --> 41:37.737
You don't even love her.

41:38.744 --> 41:41.955
Let me tell you something.
You haven't talked to me in two years.

41:41.956 --> 41:45.227
So don't stand there
and tell me how I feel.

41:48.712 --> 41:52.126
I know you better
than you think I do, Jim.

41:52.633 --> 41:54.883
I know why you dropped out of med school.

41:54.977 --> 41:56.125
Does Linda?

41:56.345 --> 41:59.019
Because you knew
you'd make a lousy doctor!

41:59.029 --> 42:02.000
Because you're not capable of giving
a shit about anyone but yourself!

42:02.001 --> 42:02.934
Shut up, Brandon.

42:02.935 --> 42:04.811
And when you get tired
of Linda, you're gonna

42:04.812 --> 42:06.406
- walk away from her too!
- Shut up, Brandon.

42:06.407 --> 42:07.894

- Take a message, I'm busy.
- It's your landlady, man.

Well, maybe Linda removed it
when you weren't looking.

56:46.359 --> 56:48.068
She's obsessed with it, Jim!

56:48.069 --> 56:51.344
That means that she's already fallen
into progressive entrapment.

56:51.906 --> 56:54.825
Well, then I just have to find
the damn thing and get rid of it.

Linda is so open now,

he got his power.

01:14:51.068 --> 01:14:53.621
David, why are you terrorizing Linda?

01:15:00.953 --> 01:15:04.043
"N-O?" N-O-what?

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:09.168
"T."

01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:11.212
"N-O-T." Not?

01:15:11.213 --> 01:15:13.848
David, do you mean
you're not terrorizing Linda?

01:15:17.094 --> 01:15:18.267
Then who is?

01:15:31.692 --> 01:15:34.752
Evil. What the hell does that mean?

01:15:35.862 --> 01:15:36.903
I don't--

01:15:38.615 --> 01:15:40.040
Wait a minute.

01:15:41.034 --> 01:15:42.391
David.

01:15:43.596 --> 01:15:46.103
You were at Jim's party, weren't you?

01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:51.037
And you flattened my tire?

01:15:55.173 --> 01:15:59.491
David, now, this is very important.
Please tell us the truth.

01:16:00.762 --> 01:16:04.437
Did you kill Lloyd
at the construction site?

01:16:08.812 --> 01:16:10.746
And you didn't kill Zarabeth?

01:16:11.857 --> 01:16:14.441
But you did speak to us through her.

01:16:17.863 --> 01:16:18.950
No.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.095
Then who the hell did we talk to?

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:37.956
Again with the evil.

01:16:38.425 --> 01:16:40.237
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think I have it.

01:16:41.136 --> 01:16:42.194
David.

01:16:43.055 --> 01:16:46.044
Is this evil another spirit?

01:16:50.103 --> 01:16:53.836
Is this spirit powerful?
Did it force you out of Jim's apartment?

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.857
Is this spirit's name Malfeitor?

01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:04.325
Then Linda never actually contacted you

01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:06.818
all the time she was using my Ouija.

01:17:09.539 --> 01:17:12.249
Alright, then who's Malfeitor?

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:14.303
That's what we're gonna find out.

01:17:15.295 --> 01:17:19.837
David? Who is Malfeitor?

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.524
"Her?" Who is "her?"

01:17:36.525 --> 01:17:38.216
David, do you mean Linda?

01:17:39.444 --> 01:17:41.241

01:17:46.326 --> 01:17:48.804
I don't know, he's agitated.
Be careful.

What's the matter?

01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:54.961
Hey.

Didn't you say they were lousy spellers?

01:17:57.989 --> 01:17:59.046
That's right.

01:17:59.047 --> 01:18:01.565

01:18:06.221 --> 01:18:08.662
Alright. Okay.
