00:35.143 --> 00:38.147
From the day I was
old enough to like boys,

00:38.180 --> 00:41.083
I was overwhelmed and sold
on the idea of the perfect

00:41.116 --> 00:42.519
guy for me.

00:54.099 --> 00:57.136
This romantic view of
the opposite sex is --

01:04.376 --> 01:07.180
is just that:
a romanticized illusion.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.466
And ladies,
let's be honest.

01:27.666 --> 01:30.071
Sometimes that illusion
is a downright scary

01:30.104 --> 01:31.706
nightmare.

01:33.107 --> 01:34.075
Hi!

01:34.107 --> 01:35.075
Roger?

01:35.108 --> 01:36.979
What's going here?

01:43.185 --> 01:45.087
Now, am I saying
all hope is lost?

01:45.120 --> 01:48.490
That there are no
diamonds in the rough?

01:48.524 --> 01:51.459
As far as I'm concerned,
the myth of the perfect

01:51.492 --> 01:55.364
mate, the so-called 'Mr. Right
is just that -- a myth.

01:55.398 --> 01:57.667
Right up there
with the Tooth Fairy,

01:57.699 --> 02:00.202
the Easter
Bunny, and Bigfoot.

02:00.235 --> 02:04.541
Hey, girl!

02:04.573 --> 02:07.044
I've got a
surprise for you.

02:07.077 --> 02:08.178
Ta-dah!

02:08.211 --> 02:10.548
You're gonna look
so hot in this.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.184
Hmm.. a hot, slutty mess.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.084
Same difference.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.186
Louis is
gonna lose his mind.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.488
He's a jock, Norma.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.490
He doesn't have
that much to lose.

02:19.524 --> 02:21.193
Okay, keep talking like
that and I'll go out with

02:21.225 --> 02:22.127
the man myself.

02:22.161 --> 02:24.195
How much do you
even know about this guy?

02:24.229 --> 02:26.130
Well since you asked
Mm Hmm

02:26.163 --> 02:28.132
My assistant's sister's
mother-in-law's best

02:28.165 --> 02:30.202
friend says that he's
a really good catch.

02:30.236 --> 02:32.372
And she should
know; she's his mama.

02:34.373 --> 02:35.742
Okay that's it

02:35.775 --> 02:37.544
No, no!
Lisa, wait!

02:37.576 --> 02:39.145
hold on -- wait.

02:39.177 --> 02:41.213
Listen, you may think that
it's okay for you to spend

02:41.247 --> 02:42.215
the rest of your life
making love to this

02:42.249 --> 02:43.350
laptop.

02:43.384 --> 02:46.254
But as your best friend, I
refuse to let that happen.

02:47.453 --> 02:50.658
Now go put this on
and go get your man.

02:51.558 --> 02:53.694
You wasting
time, let's go!

02:53.726 --> 02:54.695
Come on!

02:54.728 --> 02:57.398
All right.

03:03.738 --> 03:05.173
Mm mm mm..

03:05.206 --> 03:09.178
Oh, so anyway, I've been
going back and forth all

03:09.210 --> 03:11.179
day long with my agent
because the season's about

03:11.213 --> 03:13.281
to start and I
don't have a team yet.

03:13.315 --> 03:14.484
Well wait, I thought
you said you were an

03:14.517 --> 03:15.650
NFL player.

03:15.684 --> 03:17.186
Oh, I am!

03:17.219 --> 03:18.187
But I went free
agent, you know,

03:18.221 --> 03:20.324
so its gonna
be a rough year.

03:20.357 --> 03:22.192
Not being able to run
drills

03:22.224 --> 03:24.193
 and train with your team?

03:24.227 --> 03:26.295
Mm, that and bills.

03:26.329 --> 03:28.298
Well havent you saved
all those millions

03:28.330 --> 03:29.900
for a rainy day?

03:29.933 --> 03:34.171
Millions?

03:34.205 --> 03:35.173
Yes.

03:35.205 --> 03:36.173
Girl, I wish
I had millions.

03:36.206 --> 03:38.109
If I had millions, I'd
be retired right now.

03:39.242 --> 03:40.277
So no millions?

03:40.311 --> 03:41.278
Hell no!

03:41.312 --> 03:42.281
Thousands?

03:42.313 --> 03:44.282
Oh, yeah.

03:44.315 --> 03:49.687
I made about $300,000
-- over five seasons.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.190
Uh, forgive
my ignorance,

03:52.224 --> 03:53.927
but isn't that
a little low?

03:53.959 --> 03:55.928
Hell yeah!

03:55.962 --> 03:57.530
Well, the starters make
a lot more than that.

03:57.564 --> 04:00.800
Even still, isn't that
low for a second-stringer?

04:00.832 --> 04:02.768
No, they make
pretty good money, too

04:02.802 --> 04:05.539
It's us on the practice
squad that gets cheated.

04:05.571 --> 04:07.340
See, that's why I
went free agent.

04:07.374 --> 04:08.309
Oh.

04:08.341 --> 04:10.310
Practice squad.

04:10.344 --> 04:11.612
Mm-hm.

04:11.644 --> 04:15.850
Well, some people
don't even make the team.

04:15.882 --> 04:19.154
Uh, we're ready to order.

04:22.490 --> 04:24.692
All right, now you're
sure I can't interest you

04:24.726 --> 04:25.694
in some of our
hand-crafted gourmet

04:25.726 --> 04:26.727
desserts here?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.262
Mm.. That
sounds really good!

04:28.296 --> 04:30.532
Nah, my good
man, we are stuffed.

04:30.566 --> 04:32.268
But I will take
that check brother.

04:32.301 --> 04:33.369
Oh!

04:33.402 --> 04:34.571
We've got to get on
to the best part of the evening.

04:34.604 --> 04:35.572
Most definitely.

04:35.604 --> 04:36.573
There you go.

04:36.606 --> 04:37.674
Hm!

04:39.008 --> 04:41.912
Hooo.. I feel like a pig
after devouring that big

04:41.944 --> 04:44.415
steak and all you
had was a salad.

04:44.447 --> 04:47.250
Yeah, it's all good.

04:48.384 --> 04:50.286
I guess that's
how you stay so fit!

04:50.319 --> 04:51.387
Uh, one
second, sweetheart.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.359
I'm trying to add
this up correctly.

04:54.392 --> 04:56.995
They usually do
the adding for you.

04:57.027 --> 04:58.796
As a whole, yes.

04:59.363 --> 05:00.664
As a whole?

05:00.698 --> 05:02.433
Yeah, I'm trying to add
up everything that I ate

05:02.467 --> 05:04.868
and drank, so I
know what to pay.

05:04.902 --> 05:07.306
Well, what about
what I ate and drank?

05:07.338 --> 05:09.374
I'm about to let
you know that in just a

05:09.408 --> 05:10.376
second.

05:10.408 --> 05:11.610
Mm-hm.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.555
Have I told you
how sexy you are?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.403
I'll be back in two minutes.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.404
I'll be back.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.405
All right ladies,
please come in here so we

05:38.439 --> 05:39.874
can get the -- oooh!

05:39.907 --> 05:41.777

bad decisions, baby!

05:41.810 --> 05:44.312
No, What?

05:44.346 --> 05:45.314
Hell no!

05:45.346 --> 05:46.414
Hell no, what?

05:47.315 --> 05:49.417
I stopped drinking.

05:49.451 --> 05:50.285
Stopped drinking what?

05:50.319 --> 05:53.422
Alcohol, liquor,
you knappy-headed slave!

05:53.454 --> 05:54.424
Haha!

05:54.457 --> 05:55.425
Yeah, you little slave.

05:55.457 --> 05:56.426
That's --
that's enough.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.426
Okay.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.061
And we done told you --
Hey -- If you gonna say

05:59.094 --> 06:00.664
the 'slave' thing,
use it -- Okay.

06:00.696 --> 06:02.298
-- in, in, in quick action.
Okay.

06:02.332 --> 06:03.599
Don't be
late with it man.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.836
You may embarrass us!
Don't do that!

06:05.869 --> 06:07.470
Anyways, yo.

06:07.504 --> 06:08.605
This is the first time in
three weeks that we've all

06:08.639 --> 06:10.307
been off work at
the same time, man.

06:10.341 --> 06:11.509
Especially Mr.
Popular over here.

06:11.542 --> 06:12.843
Yeah, that is true man.

06:12.876 --> 06:15.012
Look, there's a lot of
single ladies out there

06:15.045 --> 06:16.847
that need our services!

06:16.879 --> 06:18.316
Mm-hm.

06:18.349 --> 06:20.652
Oh, I'm sorry, am I
interrupting something?

06:20.685 --> 06:22.521
Okay, what,

06:22.553 --> 06:23.522
Mike?

06:23.555 --> 06:24.523
Why?

06:24.556 --> 06:25.524
Why is Satan here, man?

06:25.556 --> 06:26.590
Satan?

06:26.623 --> 06:27.792
I got you're
Satan's Stewart Little.

06:27.825 --> 06:29.327
Look, if you talkin'
about a man who got mad

06:29.361 --> 06:31.364
chicks, then yeah,
you talkin' about me.

06:31.396 --> 06:33.098
Ain't nothing

06:33.131 --> 06:34.100
They hired you?

06:34.133 --> 06:35.101
Okay!

06:35.133 --> 06:36.102
Oh, okay!

06:36.134 --> 06:37.102
Sit!

06:37.136 --> 06:38.438
Did you

06:38.470 --> 06:39.471
Yeah!

06:39.504 --> 06:40.807
Yeah, uh
listen: Booty, chill.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.942
Beast, this tale is as old
as time and I'm over it.

06:42.976 --> 06:44.345
Huh?

06:44.377 --> 06:45.611
I'm over it!

06:45.644 --> 06:46.813
He was just playing.

06:46.846 --> 06:48.348
I wasn't
playing nothing, man.

06:48.382 --> 06:49.783
I don't even
know why she here.

06:49.815 --> 06:50.784
I don't see why you didn't
throw her to the curb with

06:50.817 --> 06:51.952
the rest of the trash.

06:52.985 --> 06:54.955
Is that what you tell
your friends about us?

06:54.989 --> 06:56.491
No, no, no.

06:56.523 --> 06:57.858
Beth,
went over your head.

06:57.892 --> 06:58.860
The girl with the chest
and the ass -- the girl

06:58.893 --> 07:00.361
with the --
chest and the ass.

07:00.395 --> 07:02.130
So what, am I just some
booty call for you now?

07:02.162 --> 07:04.032
Well, in
ancient Africa,

07:04.064 --> 07:06.368
'Booee-Call' is the
highest level -- it's the

07:06.401 --> 07:08.503
highest level of respect.

07:08.536 --> 07:09.871
It's true.

07:09.905 --> 07:11.407
Well, let's
just be real, Maria

07:11.439 --> 07:14.076
You just popped up, per
usual -- no respect there.

07:14.108 --> 07:15.677
Yeah, we don't
get down like that.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.048
You got a lot of
baggage, I'm Southwest.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.717
Your bags don't
fly free here!

07:20.750 --> 07:21.985
Okay.
You know what?

07:22.017 --> 07:23.419
Stay here and play
with your little friends,

07:23.452 --> 07:25.554
because I can do better
than your ass anyways.

07:25.587 --> 07:28.558
Call me whenever you get
your shit together and

07:28.590 --> 07:29.893
when you grow
your ass up, okay?

07:30.895 --> 07:31.863
Hush!

07:31.896 --> 07:32.864
If you want me
to call you,

07:32.896 --> 07:34.030
I got to get my iPhone
out your car real quick.

07:34.064 --> 07:35.165
Hold up!

07:35.199 --> 07:36.167
Why you chasing her?

07:36.199 --> 07:37.067
We don't chase!

07:37.100 --> 07:38.735
Out with the girl,
in with the bottle.

07:38.768 --> 07:40.004
Don't talk.

07:40.037 --> 07:41.539
Let's make these moves.

07:41.571 --> 07:42.541
You gotta -- look,
work on your 'slave' shit!

07:42.574 --> 07:43.542
I am!

07:43.575 --> 07:44.543
I mean -- You know, we
gotta -- -- it's more

07:44.575 --> 07:45.376
of the delivery.

07:45.409 --> 07:46.544
Great job.

07:46.577 --> 07:47.378
Yeah!

07:47.411 --> 07:48.546
to blow it.
Thanks, man.

07:48.579 --> 07:49.548
You guys
play a great game,

07:49.580 --> 07:50.548
White Men Can't
Jump -- awesome.

07:50.582 --> 07:51.550
Ha-ha!

07:51.582 --> 07:52.551
White man -- Haters!

07:52.584 --> 07:53.351
Why?

07:53.385 --> 07:54.554
Well, we gotta
be all that shit.

07:54.587 --> 07:55.622
I'm being if I
was -- you know,

07:55.655 --> 07:56.523
if I could shoot -- We
didn't even say -- Mitch,

07:56.556 --> 07:57.590
give him a drink,
because he need it.

07:57.623 --> 07:58.591
He need it.

07:58.624 --> 07:59.592
Let's pour
the guy a drink.

07:59.624 --> 08:00.592
Please.
Get this boy a drink.

08:00.626 --> 08:01.594
No.

08:01.626 --> 08:02.595
Drink your
sorrows away.

08:02.628 --> 08:04.030
Man, quit playing, man!

08:04.063 --> 08:05.565
Take this drink and the
girl go -- and then all that.

08:05.597 --> 08:06.866
Come on, you
got some pussy,

08:06.899 --> 08:08.067
you free, come on, man.

08:08.101 --> 08:09.002
Let's go, baby!

08:09.036 --> 08:10.204
You sweatin' this shit
-- Think about it.

08:10.237 --> 08:11.205
-- that mean
you got it in.

08:11.238 --> 08:12.206
Think about it!

08:12.238 --> 08:13.206
I know. I know.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.208
Fuck it.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.508
Come on, baby.
It's love.

08:15.541 --> 08:17.577
Hell, yeah.
It's love in the air!

08:17.611 --> 08:19.448
Shit!

08:19.481 --> 08:21.450
I took that shit too
fast, didn't I?

08:22.650 --> 08:25.787
Yes, yes.

08:25.820 --> 08:30.593
Right there!

08:33.495 --> 08:35.063
 Okay, before
 you say anything,

08:35.096 --> 08:36.798
I just want to inform
you that I'm on Cloud Nine

08:36.831 --> 08:39.802
right now, so unless
this is a life-or-death

08:39.835 --> 08:42.472
situation --
 This is all your fault!

08:42.505 --> 08:43.472
Louis the Loser?

08:43.506 --> 08:45.476
I told you I didn't want
to go on yet another one

08:45.509 --> 08:47.778
of your blind dates,
but did you listen to me?

08:47.811 --> 08:49.179
No.

08:49.212 --> 08:51.081
So what ends up happening:
I end up going dutch with

08:51.114 --> 08:52.683
a so called football
player who got his

08:52.716 --> 08:54.651
Superbowl ring
in the mail.

08:54.684 --> 08:55.652
Sweetie, I'm sorry,
but I really got...

08:55.685 --> 08:57.088
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:57.121 --> 08:57.954
I know, I know.

08:57.988 --> 08:59.690
His mother thinks
he's a real catch.

08:59.723 --> 09:04.862
Hello?

09:04.895 --> 09:06.531
Yes, ooh, right there!

09:06.565 --> 09:08.868
You nasty little wench!

09:08.901 --> 09:10.135
Did you just answer
the phone while you were

09:10.167 --> 09:11.202
getting your --?

09:11.236 --> 09:12.204
No, no, no, no, no.

09:12.237 --> 09:13.973
I'm laying here with my
legs back while Steven

09:14.006 --> 09:17.108
takes care of everything.

09:17.142 --> 09:18.110
Wait a minute -

09:18.143 --> 09:19.111
- foot fetish Steve?

09:19.144 --> 09:20.112
Yes, girl.

09:20.146 --> 09:22.649
He is giving me
life right now.

09:22.681 --> 09:23.950
He missed
Momma's toes very much.

09:23.983 --> 09:24.950
You know what?

09:24.984 --> 09:25.951
You have issues.

09:25.984 --> 09:26.753
No, girl.

09:26.786 --> 09:27.553
The only issue
 I have is being

09:27.586 --> 09:28.955
on the phone with
you right now.

09:28.988 --> 09:30.557
Look, I've got to go.

09:30.591 --> 09:31.392
I will call you back and I
will plan something really

09:31.424 --> 09:32.692
extravagant for
your birthday, okay?

09:32.725 --> 09:33.559
Norma --
No, I've got to go, Lisa.

09:33.594 --> 09:34.862
Norma, wait -
I will call you back.

09:34.894 --> 09:35.862
Bye, Lisa!
Come on, please!

09:35.895 --> 09:37.030
Bye!

09:37.063 --> 09:38.899
Bye-bye-bye-bye.

09:39.033 --> 09:39.866
Ooh, yes!

09:39.899 --> 09:41.302
Oh, keep going.

09:41.335 --> 09:49.577
Ooh, mm-hm.

09:54.916 --> 09:56.552
It's not that I don't
want there to be a perfect

09:56.585 --> 09:58.620
match out there for me.

09:58.654 --> 10:01.090
I just have to be
honest about the reality.

10:01.122 --> 10:04.259
So it begs the question:
Are there actually any

10:04.293 --> 10:06.664
decent men left out there?

10:06.696 --> 10:10.567
Does Mr. Right
really exist?

10:17.774 --> 10:19.643
Seriously?

10:19.677 --> 10:21.278
Hi, I'm Frank Brinkley.

10:21.311 --> 10:23.248
Welcome to MyMr.Right.com.

10:23.281 --> 10:25.215
Now, if you're
even on this site,

10:25.249 --> 10:28.619
you're looking for the
seemingly unattainable

10:28.652 --> 10:29.621
Mr. Right.

10:29.654 --> 10:30.622
You think?

10:30.655 --> 10:31.623
And you're
convinced that

10:31.657 --> 10:32.792
he doesn't even exist!

10:32.825 --> 10:34.759
But I'm here to tell
you, you are wrong.

10:34.793 --> 10:37.897
Here at MyMr.Right.com,
you can create the perfect

10:37.929 --> 10:40.298
guy, and we'll send him
straight to your door.

10:40.331 --> 10:42.703
Please note that
MyMr.Right.com is not an

10:42.736 --> 10:45.905
escort service, as
sexual favors are

10:45.938 --> 10:47.106
strictly prohibited.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.674
But ladies,
isn't that the

10:48.707 --> 10:50.677
best way to find
a great guy?

10:50.709 --> 10:52.612
Click right here, and
you'll be one click away

10:52.645 --> 10:54.616
from Mr. Right.

10:54.649 --> 10:56.951
No?

10:58.252 --> 11:00.287
 You don't like
this one, do you?

11:00.320 --> 11:01.088
Okay,

11:01.122 --> 11:06.996
Chan-chan says 'no'.

11:07.028 --> 11:09.764
 I came this close to
 completing a profile.

11:09.797 --> 11:11.700
Talk about desperate.

11:11.733 --> 11:14.303
You should have.

11:14.335 --> 11:15.903
Okay, I think maybe
you're not getting enough

11:15.936 --> 11:17.807
oxygen to your
brain right now.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.673
What?

11:18.707 --> 11:19.742
You said it's not
an escort service.

11:19.776 --> 11:20.810
Why not?

11:20.842 --> 11:22.311
It's just for fun.

11:22.345 --> 11:25.815
Okay, so you
have some fun.

11:36.226 --> 11:41.332
Maybe I will.

11:47.371 --> 11:53.680
Ugh.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.814
Girl, man.

11:55.848 --> 12:03.356
What?

12:03.388 --> 12:05.692
Like right now is
not a good time.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.859
This is Frank, baby!

12:06.892 --> 12:08.327
I just reeled in a
big fish for you now!

12:08.360 --> 12:09.395
Frank?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.731
Haha!

12:10.763 --> 12:13.801
This girl's profile
suits you to a T!

12:13.834 --> 12:14.801
Does she?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.003
She paid
with a black card,

12:16.036 --> 12:17.003
Mike.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.373
A black card!

12:18.406 --> 12:19.840
This is huge.

12:19.874 --> 12:21.743
Now, Melissa's sending
you over all the profile

12:21.776 --> 12:24.045
information right now with
a few dos and don'ts for

12:24.077 --> 12:25.045
the date.

12:25.079 --> 12:26.181
Dos and don'ts?

12:26.214 --> 12:27.882
You know, the usual.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.351
These ladies like to feel
like they're on a real

12:30.385 --> 12:34.189
date, so no talk of
being a hired hand.

12:34.222 --> 12:37.827
And Mike, I need your
best acting job on this,

12:37.860 --> 12:38.861
do you hear me?

12:38.894 --> 12:40.796
All right,
sounds easy enough.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.797
Hey, hey, hey!

12:41.831 --> 12:42.799
Don't dismiss
me like that,

12:42.832 --> 12:43.900
dog!

12:43.933 --> 12:44.900
Cause of you
don't do this right,

12:44.934 --> 12:46.737
guess what?

12:46.770 --> 12:48.371
I-Imma kill Fontaine.

12:48.404 --> 12:49.806
'Taine's your
nephew, Frank.

12:49.838 --> 12:50.773
We don't -- we
don't know that.

12:50.807 --> 12:52.042
You know what I'm saying?

12:52.074 --> 12:53.444
That's what his --
that's what his momma say.

12:53.477 --> 12:57.381
But d-don't -- don't have
a death on your hands.

12:57.414 --> 12:58.382
All right.

12:58.415 --> 12:59.382
All right?

12:59.415 --> 13:00.885
Holla.

13:00.917 --> 13:03.120
Hell-hello?

13:05.956 --> 13:08.926
MyMr.Right.com,
Frank speaking.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.796
Hey, Momma!

13:10.829 --> 13:12.765
What?

13:12.797 --> 13:14.466
No, I'm not gonna
hook you up with Mike!

13:15.901 --> 13:17.202
Norma, will you at
least tell where we're going?

13:17.234 --> 13:19.806
I don't want to have a bad
surprise on my birthday.

13:19.839 --> 13:22.242
Trust me,
you'll love it.

13:22.274 --> 13:27.379
I should be at your
door in 3...2...1...

13:27.413 --> 13:31.117
You're
funny.

13:31.150 --> 13:33.920
Funny!

13:33.953 --> 13:36.289
Girl, come on!

13:38.859 --> 13:41.329
So what is
love at first sight?

13:41.362 --> 13:43.430
Does it actually happen?

13:43.463 --> 13:45.566
Well, I think I can
actually confirm that it

13:45.599 --> 13:46.567
exists.

13:46.601 --> 13:50.972
I wasn't a believer, but
I think he changed that.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.847
Do you eat ice cream?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.881
Dude, who
doesn't eat ice cream?

13:59.915 --> 14:01.416
I mean, have you ever
seen anybody eat ice cream

14:01.449 --> 14:02.951
mad?

14:03.953 --> 14:05.455
After a
horrible date, maybe.

14:05.488 --> 14:07.123
Like, "Give me that
damn cone!" "Give it to

14:07.157 --> 14:09.359
me now!" "This date
sucks!" "It sucks!"

14:09.392 --> 14:10.494
"This date is horrible!"
"Give me -- give me

14:10.527 --> 14:12.329
butter pecan." So
when we get there,

14:12.362 --> 14:13.864
what are we gonna say?

14:13.897 --> 14:15.265
I'm gonna be like, "Hey!"
What are you gonna say?

14:15.297 --> 14:18.870
Uh, "Give me butter
pecan --NOW!" See?

14:18.903 --> 14:20.171
Cause I'm pissed.
Pissed!

14:20.203 --> 14:21.839
I just wasted my time.
Wasted my time.

14:21.873 --> 14:22.874
It was an awful date.
Horrible date.

14:22.907 --> 14:24.142
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm, yep.

14:24.174 --> 14:27.911
So, you know, I think
because of it was so

14:27.945 --> 14:28.947
horrible, we
deserve a Mulligan.

14:28.980 --> 14:30.015
You know what
a Mulligan is?

14:30.048 --> 14:31.482
Yeah, I mean
you know -- yeah,

14:31.515 --> 14:32.617
you know golf.

14:32.650 --> 14:33.885
I got you.

14:33.919 --> 14:37.021
I do, so --
That's up to you.

14:37.054 --> 14:38.056
I'm in.

14:38.090 --> 14:39.158
You're in?
Yeah!

14:39.191 --> 14:40.192
Okay.
I'll do anything.

14:40.225 --> 14:41.895
What you want to do?

14:42.227 --> 14:43.896
Do you cycle?
Cycle?

14:43.929 --> 14:44.897
Yeah.

14:44.930 --> 14:45.898
Like cycle at the gym?

14:45.931 --> 14:46.999
Like a bike.

14:47.032 --> 14:47.867
With a bike?

14:47.900 --> 14:49.202
Pfff, girl!

14:49.234 --> 14:51.403
What are you talk -- They
call me -- I like Lance

14:51.437 --> 14:52.939
Armstrong, but
they call me Glance,

14:52.972 --> 14:54.909
because quick
glance, you miss me.

14:54.941 --> 14:55.942
Fly by you.

14:55.975 --> 14:57.043
Come on.
Yeah.

14:57.076 --> 14:58.211
You ready?
You're not ready for that?

14:58.244 --> 14:59.647
No, You need to
work up the jokes.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.647
But yes, I'm ready.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.648
Let's go.

15:01.681 --> 15:02.649
Work on my jokes?

15:02.682 --> 15:05.185
not good.

15:16.096 --> 15:18.567
Thought I
might find you here.

15:18.601 --> 15:20.035
I was gonna go to
your house but then I

15:20.068 --> 15:21.036
remembered you like to
come here and do your

15:21.070 --> 15:22.973
little painting thing.

15:24.273 --> 15:27.176
You're all
sensitive, geez.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.445
You don't
know me at all,

15:29.478 --> 15:30.480
do you?

15:31.481 --> 15:32.448
This little 'painting
thing' is my passion,

15:32.481 --> 15:33.918
Maria.

15:33.951 --> 15:34.819
Babe, that's fine.

15:34.852 --> 15:38.054
But man cannot live
on painting alone.

15:39.255 --> 15:40.924
You can't pay light
bills and car notes with

15:40.957 --> 15:41.993
paintings.

15:42.026 --> 15:42.994
I'm sure my father could
help you get a job at his

15:43.027 --> 15:45.396
office when you're ready
for a change of scenery.

15:45.429 --> 15:46.397
Oh my God, Maria.

15:46.430 --> 15:47.398
Thank you.

15:47.431 --> 15:48.399
Thank you so much!

15:48.433 --> 15:50.702
Like I was --
I was really,

15:50.734 --> 15:53.405
really hoping that your
dad could hook me up.

15:53.439 --> 15:54.240
Are you kidding me?

15:54.272 --> 15:55.941
Apparently,
you're not getting it.

15:55.974 --> 15:58.243
Me and you are from
different planets.

15:58.277 --> 15:59.478
I don't even know
-- you're an alien.

15:59.511 --> 16:01.314
You're like a -- I
understand how difficult

16:01.347 --> 16:02.982
it is to be in
the enemy's space,

16:03.014 --> 16:05.016
always feel like you're
not measuring up in the

16:05.050 --> 16:08.088
workforce, in
life, in the bedroom.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.122
But I'm a
patient, understanding,

16:10.156 --> 16:12.125
and forgiving woman, and I
want to be here with you

16:12.157 --> 16:13.960
while you get
through this.

16:13.994 --> 16:15.662
While I get
through what?

16:15.695 --> 16:17.030
I don't know.

16:17.062 --> 16:17.998
These feelings of
inadequacy you're having

16:18.032 --> 16:19.968
or whatever it is you're
going through that's

16:20.000 --> 16:21.302
making you treat me
like trash on the curb!

16:21.335 --> 16:24.005
Look, you
don't have to explain it

16:24.038 --> 16:25.005
to me.

16:25.038 --> 16:26.006
No, I don't.

16:26.039 --> 16:27.040
I'm gonna be here.

16:27.075 --> 16:27.908
I don't -- I won't,
because I'm actually not.

16:27.942 --> 16:31.347
Um, hm -- this is
gonna be awkward,

16:31.380 --> 16:33.115
because this is that
conversation where it's

16:33.148 --> 16:35.985
you, not me,
but we're done,

16:36.017 --> 16:37.052
okay?

16:37.552 --> 16:39.021
It's me, it's not you.

16:39.054 --> 16:40.121
Sorry.

16:40.155 --> 16:43.327
We
should see other people.

16:44.359 --> 16:45.527
Is that what
this is about here,

16:45.560 --> 16:47.064
Michael?

16:48.064 --> 16:49.031
Like, normally
whenever guys say,

16:49.064 --> 16:50.132
"We should see
other people,

16:50.165 --> 16:51.100
 it usually means
they already are.

16:51.133 --> 16:52.101
Is that what
this is about?

16:52.135 --> 16:53.103
You seeing other people?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.104
I don't know.

16:54.137 --> 16:55.105
I see.

16:55.138 --> 16:56.106
Just told
you what it was,

16:56.139 --> 16:57.107
You know what?

16:57.141 --> 16:59.043
I'm really, really sorry.

16:59.075 --> 17:00.478
Me, too.
It was terrible.

17:00.511 --> 17:01.512
About everything.

17:01.545 --> 17:02.512
Me, too.

17:02.546 --> 17:03.513
I am so sorry.

17:03.546 --> 17:05.048
Except this!

17:05.082 --> 17:07.051
Take
that for some motivation,

17:07.085 --> 17:08.753
you douchebag!

17:11.221 --> 17:12.624
There you go.
Oh, well thank you.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.157
Thank you.

17:14.191 --> 17:19.531
I appreciate -- I'm sor
-- I'm sorry (laughing and

17:19.565 --> 17:21.201
slurping).

17:22.067 --> 17:23.169
I like that.

17:23.202 --> 17:25.069
I like that a lot.

17:25.104 --> 17:29.343
So um, I've been meaning
to ask you why'd you and

17:29.376 --> 17:31.112
your husband break up?

17:31.711 --> 17:33.213
Uh, just out of curiosity.

17:33.245 --> 17:34.480
I'm just curious.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.183
I just wanted to know,
you know what I mean?

17:36.215 --> 17:40.353
Well, he was
this tall, sexy,

17:40.386 --> 17:43.358
hot, Latino lover boy.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.259
He didn't want to be in
monogamous relationships,

17:45.292 --> 17:46.527
so -- Oh, right.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.163
Yeah, you gotta get rid
of them kind of guys,

17:48.195 --> 17:49.164
you know what I'm saying?

17:49.196 --> 17:50.531
They -- they all
over the place,

17:50.565 --> 17:51.366
you know.

17:51.398 --> 17:53.069
I'm faithful --
I'm a faithful guy.

17:53.101 --> 17:53.869
I'm just
throwing that in there,

17:53.903 --> 17:55.337
you know what I'm saying?
Okay.

17:55.369 --> 17:56.204
I'm a real faithful guy.
Good!

17:56.237 --> 17:57.339
So, what -- what
did you say he did for a

17:57.371 --> 17:58.740
living?

17:59.640 --> 18:00.775
What did he do
for a living?

18:00.809 --> 18:02.144
I mean, he was
like an importer,

18:02.176 --> 18:02.945
or something.

18:02.977 --> 18:03.845
Importer?
I don't know -- yeah.

18:03.878 --> 18:05.748
That's impressive,
he was an importer.

18:05.782 --> 18:07.083
That's nice.

18:07.117 --> 18:08.085
I heard he was -- he
was pretty loaded.

18:08.118 --> 18:09.753
I heard that he
has some cake.

18:09.785 --> 18:10.754
Did he?

18:10.786 --> 18:13.255
Was he pretty loaded?

18:13.289 --> 18:14.758
I'm just asking
out of curiosity,

18:14.791 --> 18:15.759
of course.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.160
I just -- He
-- he was okay,

18:17.194 --> 18:18.162
but what does this --?

18:18.195 --> 18:19.163
He -- did he
have some cake?

18:19.196 --> 18:20.164
How?

18:20.197 --> 18:20.798
What did you get out of
the divorce settlement?

18:20.831 --> 18:21.732
You know what I'm saying?

18:21.765 --> 18:24.235
I wish you can talk to me.
What'd you get?

18:24.267 --> 18:25.736
I got none of ya damn
business dollars and get

18:25.768 --> 18:27.537

up out of my house cents!

18:27.571 --> 18:28.539
No, no, no!

18:28.572 --> 18:29.541
I didn't mean
it like that.

18:29.573 --> 18:30.542
No! You did
mean it like that,

18:30.574 --> 18:31.375
Look, I didn't mean.

18:31.409 --> 18:32.244
because you asked me
about my -- No,

18:32.276 --> 18:33.578

time, let's just chill!

18:33.612 --> 18:34.479
No, you need to chill!

18:34.513 --> 18:35.581
Get your gold-digin'
ass out right now!

18:35.613 --> 18:36.582
Gold-diggin'?

18:36.614 --> 18:37.583
Yes!

18:37.615 --> 18:38.583
Ain't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

18:38.616 --> 18:40.118
Gold diggin'?

18:40.151 --> 18:41.220
Crazy -- talking
about some gold diggin'.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.490

18:43.523 --> 18:45.291
This is a $400 shirt!

18:45.324 --> 18:46.593
I just bought
this shirt, girl!

18:46.625 --> 18:47.626
I gotta return this!

18:47.660 --> 18:48.661
Yeah, yeah, goodbye!

18:48.693 --> 18:49.661
See you later!

18:49.695 --> 18:50.830
Thank you!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.132
I'm glad they
didn't put my name on your

18:52.164 --> 18:52.965
account!

18:54.233 --> 18:56.136
He was a perfect
gentleman from beginning

18:56.170 --> 18:57.171
to end.

18:57.204 --> 19:02.143
Oh, he's
smart and funny and sweet.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.910
He has a real job.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.780
[INDISCERNIBLE]
And he's an artist.

19:06.814 --> 19:08.182
Really?

19:08.215 --> 19:11.318
Where
did you say you met him?

19:11.352 --> 19:12.621
Oh, God no.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.155
I mean, I know people.

19:14.189 --> 19:15.157
I've been around.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.160
True.

19:17.193 --> 19:19.162
But why didn't you
keep him for yourself?

19:19.194 --> 19:23.165
Not
that I'm complaining.

19:23.199 --> 19:24.167
Mm, mm, mm.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.635
Wait a minute.

19:26.668 --> 19:27.802
Did you --?

19:27.836 --> 19:29.173
What?

19:29.205 --> 19:30.174
Oh, no -- Oooh!
-- hell no!

19:30.206 --> 19:31.707
You know I don't
roll like that.

19:31.741 --> 19:32.709
Are you lying to me?

19:32.742 --> 19:33.710
No, we kissed.

19:33.742 --> 19:35.178
That's it.

19:35.212 --> 19:36.113
Mm-hmm.

19:36.146 --> 19:37.181
I told you he was
the perfect gentleman,

19:37.213 --> 19:38.549
girl.

19:38.581 --> 19:40.283
This one's a keeper.

19:40.317 --> 19:41.786
Okay, wait Lisa.

19:41.819 --> 19:44.489
I mean, I'm sure that he's
a good guy and everything.

19:44.522 --> 19:45.656
But you just met him!

19:45.689 --> 19:48.225
You already sound
like you're in love.

19:48.259 --> 19:50.662
I didn't say
I was in love.

19:50.695 --> 19:56.801
But he's kind of what
I've been looking for.

19:56.834 --> 20:00.305
Look, I don't know when
was the last time I was

20:00.339 --> 20:04.777
this hopeful, so thank
you.

20:12.385 --> 20:15.422
Come on, come on!

20:15.455 --> 20:17.658
I need you to pick up.

20:17.690 --> 20:20.260
Yo, man!

20:20.294 --> 20:22.396
MyMr.Right.com,
Frank speaking!

20:22.428 --> 20:24.364
Hi, this is Norma
Jenkins Hernandez.

20:24.398 --> 20:25.366
How are you?

20:25.399 --> 20:26.534
Ah!

20:26.566 --> 20:29.003
Ms. Norma
Jenkins Hernandez!

20:29.036 --> 20:31.405
Look, your guy by the
name of -- I think his

20:31.439 --> 20:32.273
name is Michael
or something.

20:32.306 --> 20:34.242
He really did my
girl dirty last night.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.577
I mean, dirty to the point
where she thinks she's in love.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.412
Whoa, whoa, whoa --
love is strictly against

20:38.446 --> 20:41.017
the policies here
at MyMr.Right.com!

20:41.049 --> 20:42.251
That's not the
way we

20:42.285 --> 20:43.686
Blah, blah, blah.

20:43.719 --> 20:44.921
Okay, look -- this is
exactly what you're gonna do:

20:44.953 --> 20:46.588
you're gonna book him
for the next month or so

20:46.622 --> 20:48.391
until I figure out
what I need to do.

20:48.423 --> 20:50.859
Yeah, yeah.
I hear that.

20:50.892 --> 20:52.428
You know, we can do that
for the -- for the next month.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.632
And I don't want him to
mention a word of this to Lisa.

20:54.664 --> 20:56.933
Okay, I mean you know,
that could be our little secret.

20:56.967 --> 20:58.701
And I don't want him
to even breathe my name.

20:58.735 --> 20:59.903
You got it?

20:59.935 --> 21:01.537
I ain't gonna
tell Michael nothin',

21:01.570 --> 21:02.538
okay?

21:02.572 --> 21:03.540
Perfect.

21:03.573 --> 21:04.708
Well, I'll be in touch.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.577
You know what,
Ms. Jenkins Hernandez,

21:06.611 --> 21:09.447
see, this type of dialogue
is what I'm talking about.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.750
When a man and a woman --
you know what I mean --

21:12.784 --> 21:14.619
hear each other's voices,
that could -- Hello?

21:14.652 --> 21:16.621
Hello?

21:16.654 --> 21:18.357
Getting late in here?

21:18.389 --> 21:19.357
You know
what I'm saying, yo?

21:19.391 --> 21:21.360
He's always late.
You know what time it is.

21:21.393 --> 21:22.428
Come on, man.

21:22.461 --> 21:23.429
Don't do that.
Whatever, man.

21:23.462 --> 21:25.431
Real talk
now, we dig that.

21:25.463 --> 21:27.066
We definitely dig that.

21:27.098 --> 21:29.002
Good game.  Word up.
That's all right.

21:29.034 --> 21:30.803
You know you had
that in you.

21:30.837 --> 21:33.307
You saw me with the --
Yeah, we did.

21:33.339 --> 21:35.474
But uh, Mike?
Two nights in a row?

21:35.508 --> 21:36.476
What you -- oh,
you talking about --?

21:36.509 --> 21:37.277
Two nights in a row?

21:37.309 --> 21:39.346
What, she got
bank or something?

21:39.378 --> 21:41.416
She's sexy. She's sexy --
I don't know. I don't care.

21:41.648 --> 21:42.617
She's got cake -- Hostess.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.084
How much cake?

21:44.118 --> 21:45.520
Ah, too much for
you -- too sweet.

21:45.552 --> 21:47.321
I really don't get it.

21:47.355 --> 21:48.990
I'm -- I'm the same
blood as my uncle.

21:49.022 --> 21:49.924
Same blood!

21:49.957 --> 21:51.325
And he keep hooking
me up with you know,

21:51.359 --> 21:52.659
ugly, booger-woogers, man!

21:52.693 --> 21:53.796
Come on.

21:53.829 --> 21:54.629
I hate this, man!

21:54.663 --> 21:55.831
Y'all get all
these exotic chicks,

21:55.863 --> 21:56.831
looking good and freaky!

21:56.865 --> 21:57.833
Look, look.

21:57.866 --> 21:59.501
I don't know
about all that.

21:59.533 --> 22:00.302
I don't even care
about all that.

22:00.334 --> 22:01.669
I'm just saying
her name is Lisa,

22:01.703 --> 22:03.605
so watch your mouth.

22:03.638 --> 22:04.606
I don't want you
talking about her,

22:04.638 --> 22:05.608
okay?

22:05.640 --> 22:06.609
Watch my mouth?

22:06.641 --> 22:07.610
Yeah, watch your mouth.

22:07.642 --> 22:08.611
Man what is --?

22:08.643 --> 22:09.611
Something happening!

22:09.645 --> 22:10.613
I'm talking to my boys.

22:10.646 --> 22:11.681
This is why people
don't talk to their boys,

22:11.714 --> 22:13.116
you know what I'm saying?

22:13.149 --> 22:15.351
Because y'all don't even
understand that part of life.

22:15.384 --> 22:16.819
No, the reason why you
don't talk to your boys

22:16.853 --> 22:18.722
because we know
the number one rule.

22:18.756 --> 22:19.957
Which is what?

22:19.989 --> 22:22.459
Never fall in love
with the customers!

22:22.493 --> 22:23.694
That's the
number one rule,

22:23.727 --> 22:24.862
stupid!

22:24.894 --> 22:27.864
Just like your part.
You're fucked up.

22:27.898 --> 22:29.700
I'm telling you
like -- He really is.

22:29.734 --> 22:30.802
You sound ridiculous.

22:30.834 --> 22:32.371
First of all,
we're not prostitutes.

22:32.403 --> 22:33.537
Mm-hmm.

22:33.571 --> 22:34.706
Secondly, I didn't
say nothing about love.

22:34.738 --> 22:35.806
I'm just saying
something is happening.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.877
There is something
happening that you

22:38.910 --> 22:40.411
would't know that because
your momma don't even like you.

22:40.445 --> 22:41.714
This is a
business, man!

22:41.747 --> 22:43.149
Yeah.

22:43.181 --> 22:44.549
This girl gonna get her
money's worth and be gone

22:44.583 --> 22:45.852
because of
what you do, man.

22:45.884 --> 22:47.386
Yeah, Mike.

22:47.420 --> 22:48.554
At this point man, you're
just confusing fantasy

22:48.586 --> 22:49.421
world with the
reality of the situation.

22:49.454 --> 22:50.922
You mean like
what you do every day?

22:50.956 --> 22:52.392
Like you confuse yourself
with Justin Timberlake?

22:52.424 --> 22:53.393
Yeah.

22:53.426 --> 22:54.861
Cry me a river, Seth!

22:54.894 --> 22:57.530
[INDISCERNIBLE]
[INDISCERNIBLE]

22:57.564 --> 22:58.398
[INDISCERNIBLE]
she had you.

22:58.432 --> 22:59.466
Your mom cried a
river when she had you!

22:59.499 --> 23:01.402
Well, guess what fellas,
I'd love to stay and talk

23:01.434 --> 23:02.470
with you boys.

23:02.502 --> 23:04.437

you guys say, this is me.

base coconut!

23:11.578 --> 23:12.914
Okay All right?

23:40.108 --> 23:41.078
Haha!

23:41.110 --> 23:42.079
What?

23:42.111 --> 23:43.814
I'm in here with this.

23:43.848 --> 23:45.450
You need to get
out of here with that.

23:45.483 --> 23:46.951
Bro, I look like
I should be the new

23:46.984 --> 23:51.522
superhero like move: One
man against all odds --

23:51.554 --> 23:54.725

Delivery Man!

23:54.758 --> 23:55.726
Ha!

23:55.760 --> 23:56.728
Delivery man, huh?

23:56.761 --> 23:57.629
In theaters right now!

23:57.661 --> 23:59.096
It's like you need
a delivery of like a

23:59.129 --> 24:00.799
extra-large T-shirt --
-- some

24:00.831 --> 24:03.569
shorts, and you definitely
gotta lose those socks

24:03.601 --> 24:04.903
before you go.

24:04.937 --> 24:06.238
Can't leave the
house in those.

24:06.272 --> 24:07.240
Right, yeah, the socks.

24:07.273 --> 24:08.942
Definitely overkill.

24:08.975 --> 24:10.976
Wow!

24:11.009 --> 24:12.611
You're really
feeling this girl, huh?

24:12.644 --> 24:13.612
Is it obvious?

24:13.646 --> 24:14.313
Huh?

24:14.347 --> 24:15.248
A little bit
obvious, yeah.

24:15.281 --> 24:17.618
I guess we can't
control who we love, huh?

24:17.650 --> 24:18.619
You think it's love?

24:18.651 --> 24:19.620
I don't know, do you?

24:19.652 --> 24:20.420
I don't know.

24:20.454 --> 24:21.822
I know what
you need to do, man.

24:21.854 --> 24:22.957
Have you heard
of The Test?

24:22.989 --> 24:24.624
Stand up.

24:24.658 --> 24:25.458
Have you taken it?

24:25.491 --> 24:26.459
I'm gonna show
you the test, okay?

24:26.493 --> 24:28.797
It's kind of all about
personal space, right?

24:28.830 --> 24:29.798
And you're
in all of mine.

24:29.831 --> 24:31.099
Yeah.

24:31.132 --> 24:32.267
So it's about being
comfortable with personal

24:32.299 --> 24:33.334
space, so we're
working on this right now.

24:33.367 --> 24:34.869
So what you want to do is
take both of her hands.

24:34.902 --> 24:35.970
All right, all right.

24:36.004 --> 24:37.005
Hold them very
close, all right?

24:37.037 --> 24:38.640
Okay.

24:38.672 --> 24:40.275
Then as slow as you can
with complete eye contact,

24:40.307 --> 24:43.613
take your hands, put
them behind -- yeah,

24:43.645 --> 24:44.846
you're good -- take yours,
put them on her shoulder.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.848
You want to slide your
right hand of kind --

24:45.881 --> 24:46.849
I'm ticklish, Seth.

24:46.882 --> 24:47.850
It's cool, it's cool.

24:47.883 --> 24:49.218
I'm ticklish!

24:49.250 --> 24:50.786
Just slide it all right
down -- I'm ticklish!

24:50.818 --> 24:51.820
Just take it
in really close,

24:51.854 --> 24:52.756
just like this.

24:52.789 --> 24:53.856
Eye contact, right
here, right here man,

24:53.890 --> 24:54.791
right here.

24:54.825 --> 24:57.794
Ooh, [INDISCERNIBLE]
I'm right here, man.

24:57.826 --> 24:58.862
I know what
this looks like.

24:58.894 --> 25:00.163
It's the Love Test, man!
Come on.

25:00.195 --> 25:01.664
Don't get weird.
Don't be weird.

25:01.698 --> 25:02.833
It's the
Love Test, man!

25:02.865 --> 25:03.834
You don't know
about the test?

25:03.866 --> 25:04.868
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

25:04.902 --> 25:05.870
What the fuck is going on?

25:05.903 --> 25:06.871
It's The Test!

25:06.904 --> 25:07.872
Come on, [INDISCERNIBLE].

25:07.904 --> 25:08.873
The Test?
The Test, my ass!

25:08.905 --> 25:09.874
Here he goes.

25:09.906 --> 25:11.174
My boys!

25:11.208 --> 25:12.677
My dogs I hang with
every day and work with?!

25:12.710 --> 25:14.546
Come on, you know this
is -- This is bullshit!

25:14.578 --> 25:15.613
You wanna become
[INDISCERNIBLE] and shit,

25:15.645 --> 25:18.216
huh? Man --
No, I gotta go, man.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.852
Wooow!

25:19.885 --> 25:21.554
What
the fuck is that?

25:21.587 --> 25:22.555
He's got a
little -- It's nasty!

25:22.588 --> 25:24.088
He's got a --
This is nasty!

25:24.121 --> 25:25.256
This is some nasty shit!

25:25.290 --> 25:27.091
You not giving a shit --
Listen -- Bitches,

25:27.125 --> 25:28.560
get away from
me, both of y'all!

25:28.594 --> 25:29.563
He has a -- he has
a biker date, man.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.564
He's good.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.565
With who?

25:31.598 --> 25:32.566
He's got to be ready!

25:32.599 --> 25:33.567
No! God!
Get! Boys!

25:33.599 --> 25:34.600
Hell.

25:46.045 --> 25:50.617
Are you good?

25:52.786 --> 25:53.956
Mike, are you good?

25:53.988 --> 25:54.956
Want to take a break?

25:54.989 --> 25:56.057
We can feed the ducks.

25:56.091 --> 25:57.059
Nah.

25:57.091 --> 25:58.726
Just stretching out.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.963
Gotta stick to the pants
where you gotta take breaks.

26:00.995 --> 26:02.097
It fucked up
Lance Armstrong,

26:02.130 --> 26:03.098
I tell you.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.099
Yeah, fucked
up really bad.

26:04.131 --> 26:05.101
Let's go!

26:05.133 --> 26:06.102
You good?

26:06.134 --> 26:07.102
No, no, let's go!

26:07.136 --> 26:08.104
You good?

26:08.137 --> 26:09.105
Yeah, go!

26:09.138 --> 26:10.206
Okay.
Go!

26:10.238 --> 26:13.309
I'm moving so
fast, you can't see me!

26:19.749 --> 26:20.784
I do -- I'm a writer.

26:20.816 --> 26:22.051
I'm a novelist.

26:22.084 --> 26:23.386
I have
a book coming up called,

26:23.420 --> 26:25.823
Coming up Short: About a
Brother Who Almost Made It

26:27.958 --> 26:30.629
Okay, so you know how
to joke -- Of course,

26:30.661 --> 26:31.829
I'm a master
-- a comedian.

26:31.863 --> 26:32.897
Is that right?

26:32.930 --> 26:34.399
Absolutely, yeah.

26:34.431 --> 26:36.634
Okay, so coming to
the stage --

26:36.668 --> 26:37.469
 Uh, oh.

26:37.501 --> 26:39.003
-- let's give a
warm applause to --

26:39.036 --> 26:40.005
Introductions.

26:40.037 --> 26:41.007
-- the Mr.
Michael Martin.

26:41.039 --> 26:42.008
Oh, I'm here.
He's in it.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.108
Listen, listen.
We're going to

26:43.142 --> 26:44.110
jump right in,
ladies and gentleman.

26:44.143 --> 26:45.710
We're going to
jump right in.

26:45.743 --> 26:46.945
So there was a
monkey, a zebra,

26:46.979 --> 26:47.980
and a donkey -- Uh-uh.

26:48.012 --> 26:49.080
They decided
that -- Uh-uh.

26:49.114 --> 26:50.082
You can't uh-uh me.

26:50.114 --> 26:51.717
It's already bad!

26:51.749 --> 26:53.119
You didn't
even give me a shot!

26:53.153 --> 26:54.788
I can tell it's
already gonna be bad.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.588
All right, all
right, I got another one.

26:55.622 --> 26:57.791
Cause I got a
plethora of jokes.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.326
So, knock-knock.

26:59.358 --> 27:01.193
Oh God, a
knock-knock joke?

27:01.227 --> 27:02.295
Really, that's
your comeback?

27:02.327 --> 27:03.930
Knock-knock.

27:03.962 --> 27:05.433
Who's there?

27:05.465 --> 27:06.800
Me.

27:06.834 --> 27:07.802
Me who?

27:07.835 --> 27:12.707
Just me.

27:14.741 --> 27:16.811
I don't like that joke.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.047
What you mean you
don't like that joke?

27:18.079 --> 27:19.881
What
do you mean not that?

27:19.915 --> 27:21.316
You know you
like that joke.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.051
It's all good.

27:28.824 --> 27:29.992
I hope I'm not
the only one that

27:30.025 --> 27:31.794
had a good time tonight.

27:32.328 --> 27:33.296
It was amazing.

27:33.329 --> 27:34.864
Did I say good?
I meant amazing.

27:34.897 --> 27:36.131
Mm-hm.
That was amazing.

27:36.165 --> 27:37.868
Amazing.

28:03.961 --> 28:06.732
Do you want to
come in for some coffee?

28:06.766 --> 28:09.267
Uh, of course.

28:09.301 --> 28:10.436
Yeah.

28:10.468 --> 28:12.337
This is
really good coffee.

28:12.371 --> 28:13.739
The best.

28:14.806 --> 28:18.911
I use a special
filter to um...filter.

28:18.945 --> 28:20.981
Mm.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.021
All right, look.

28:28.055 --> 28:30.458
I haven't stopped thinking
about you since the first

28:30.490 --> 28:33.295
day we met.

28:35.796 --> 28:38.232
I know the feeling.

28:38.266 --> 28:39.768
Good, good.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.770
Because you don't want
to be flying solo on that

28:41.804 --> 28:42.772
mission.

28:42.805 --> 28:43.773
No.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.307
Mm-mm, nooo.

28:52.581 --> 28:54.850
I really think that
something special is

28:54.884 --> 28:56.219
happening here.

28:56.251 --> 28:58.755
Agreed.

29:17.541 --> 29:19.110
That was the first time

29:19.144 --> 29:20.878
I ever drew and
I was terrible.

29:20.912 --> 29:23.148
My grandma framed, put
it over the fireplace.

29:23.181 --> 29:25.851
It -- it was
-- it was bad.

29:25.884 --> 29:29.823
Well, I'm
sure she's very proud of

29:29.856 --> 29:32.125
you now.

29:32.157 --> 29:34.860
I'm sure she's smiling
down on us as we speak.

29:34.894 --> 29:35.929
Mm-hm.

29:35.962 --> 29:41.001
Yeah.

29:41.033 --> 29:43.504
No -- I see your
lips [INDISCERNIBLE]!

29:43.536 --> 29:44.838
I can't even
believe that I fell for

29:44.871 --> 29:46.439
that!

29:46.473 --> 29:48.209
You did, you did.

29:50.177 --> 29:52.481
Maybe you can
meet her sometime?

29:54.415 --> 29:56.218
That'd be nice.

29:58.652 --> 29:59.987
Is it really 3:00
in the morning?

30:00.021 --> 30:00.989
Yeah, yeah, it is.

30:01.022 --> 30:03.826
I should go.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.868
You're trouble.

30:11.901 --> 30:13.836
Good night, Ms. Bryant.

30:15.970 --> 30:19.876
Good night, Mr. Martin.

30:21.678 --> 30:24.348
How long does it
take to fall in love?

30:26.982 --> 30:33.257
Four hours, 24
minutes, 19 seconds.

30:40.064 --> 30:42.401
Gentlemen,
gentlemen, gentlemen!

30:42.433 --> 30:44.502
Let's get to work.

30:44.536 --> 30:45.971
All right,
that's for you -- no,

30:46.003 --> 30:46.971
actually
that's not for you.

30:47.005 --> 30:48.207
That's for you.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.910
And uh, check that out.

30:50.942 --> 30:52.578
That's gonna be a
good one for you.

30:52.612 --> 30:54.180
You're gonna be all right.

30:54.212 --> 30:56.081
All right, got
some for you.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.016
Haha!

30:57.049 --> 30:58.617
Our first order of
business -- you ain't

30:58.651 --> 30:59.619
gonna believe this.

30:59.652 --> 31:00.653
Can't wait.

31:00.686 --> 31:03.222
So I got online on a
brand new community of all

31:03.256 --> 31:04.926
female little people.

31:04.959 --> 31:06.360
Bumbumbumbum

31:06.393 --> 31:07.361
he's ready to go.

31:07.394 --> 31:08.362
Right?

31:08.395 --> 31:09.163
That's you.

31:09.195 --> 31:09.996
Let me tell
you guys something,

31:10.030 --> 31:12.700
little people equal
big money, okay?

31:12.732 --> 31:14.201
Hey. So stay
with me on this.

31:14.233 --> 31:18.372
Who's with me?

31:18.406 --> 31:22.411
Okay, next up,
welcome our new guy,

31:22.444 --> 31:23.578
Chris, y'all!

31:23.610 --> 31:24.946
Yes.

31:24.980 --> 31:26.481
What up?
Chris!

31:26.513 --> 31:27.715
What's up, Chris?

31:27.749 --> 31:29.452
Show him the
ropes -- Hey,

31:29.484 --> 31:30.453
hey, hey, hey
-- LLCC, huh?

31:30.485 --> 31:33.488
Ladies Love
Cool Chris, LLCC!

31:33.522 --> 31:34.557
You
just got a nickname!

31:34.590 --> 31:36.725
Cool Chris, y'all!
Cool Chris!

31:36.759 --> 31:38.094
I'll be seeing
you at the food

31:38.127 --> 31:40.029
court at the mall.
Call out them Mexicans.

31:40.061 --> 31:42.432
And note this
that Chris is

31:42.466 --> 31:44.101
 in Jimmy's old seat.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.101
Where's Jimmy?

31:45.135 --> 31:46.103
[INDISCERNIBLE]
He's my dude.

31:46.136 --> 31:46.971
Yeah, he was
very kind, right?

31:47.004 --> 31:47.972
You gotta love him.

31:48.005 --> 31:49.606
Jimmy's ass is fired!

31:49.639 --> 31:51.140
Okay?

31:51.174 --> 31:53.511
Now, I don't know how many
I gotta tell y'all this,

31:53.544 --> 31:56.046
but there's no sex
with our clients.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.986
Gentlemen, you are
the lady's fantasy.

32:01.018 --> 32:02.120
The minute you
have sex with them,

32:02.152 --> 32:03.188
guess what?

32:03.220 --> 32:04.689
The fantasy is over.

32:04.722 --> 32:06.124
And if the
fantasy is over,

32:06.158 --> 32:07.325
then guess what?

32:07.359 --> 32:08.661
Frank don't get no money.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.161
If Frank don't
get no money,

32:10.195 --> 32:11.630
Frank gets
nervous and upset.

32:11.662 --> 32:13.031
If Frank gets
nervous and upset,

32:13.064 --> 32:16.001
somebody gets killed!

32:16.035 --> 32:18.005
What about
just a hand job while

32:19.036 --> 32:19.139
you're driving
them on a date,

32:19.171 --> 32:21.074
just you
know --

32:21.106 --> 32:24.777
No hand jobs,
no fingering, no oral,

32:24.810 --> 32:28.214
no ben-wa balls --
none of that, okay?

32:28.248 --> 32:29.217
What's that one?

32:29.249 --> 32:30.218
What's that?

32:30.250 --> 32:31.018
What's ben-wa balls?

32:31.051 --> 32:32.219
That's -- that's
one of my things.

32:32.252 --> 32:34.721
Um, anyway as
I was saying,

32:34.755 --> 32:36.691
you guys are the dream.

32:36.723 --> 32:39.626
Women come to us to
get their fantasy,

32:39.660 --> 32:41.063
and you've got to be that.

32:41.096 --> 32:43.164
All right gentlemen,

32:43.198 --> 32:44.400
I got right now.

32:44.433 --> 32:47.169
But take those sheets
and check your email.

32:47.202 --> 32:48.404

booking coming.

32:48.436 --> 32:50.371

32:50.404 --> 32:52.709
If you miss it, we

32:52.741 --> 32:53.710
I appreciate y'all.

32:53.742 --> 32:54.711
Mike, let me
holler at you.

32:54.743 --> 32:56.713
What's up, man?

32:56.745 --> 32:59.415
Man, I hate to -- I
hate to get like that.

32:59.449 --> 33:01.217
Right, you got somehow
-- you gotta let them know.

33:01.250 --> 33:02.585
That's why
you're the top guy.

33:02.617 --> 33:04.220
I try to be, man.

33:04.253 --> 33:07.157
I don't know how you do
the voodoo that you do --

33:07.191 --> 33:09.660
I got a little in my pocket.

33:09.693 --> 33:11.194
Hit

33:11.227 --> 33:12.829
The new client that
you just went out with?

33:12.862 --> 33:13.863
Yeah, yeah, which one?

33:13.897 --> 33:16.600
She just booked you

33:16.634 --> 33:19.137
Rest of the month?
Rest of the month, babe.

33:19.169 --> 33:20.604

 date no more of

33:23.108 --> 33:24.576
Whoa -- what?

33:24.609 --> 33:26.845
I mean, why would you --

So yes, you got this young
lady for the rest of the

33:35.454 --> 33:37.223
month, but you still

33:54.275 --> 33:55.642
Every time it -- what

Is that some
Little Bow Wow?

Okay.

34:09.625 --> 34:11.293
What happened?
Why you give me no paper?

34:11.326 --> 34:12.427
I really don't get that.

34:13.629 --> 34:15.630

34:16.766 --> 34:18.268
Tell your nephew

34:25.507 --> 34:27.309
I gotta tell you this.

34:27.342 --> 34:28.043
But you're my uncle.

34:28.077 --> 34:29.246
Same blood

34:33.716 --> 34:35.252
but whatever you say, man.

34:35.284 --> 34:36.753

34:46.364 --> 34:47.366
Hold your hand up.

34:47.398 --> 34:48.799
You know what, uncle?

34:48.833 --> 34:51.335

34:52.271 --> 34:57.644
Yeah, I think I'm

34:57.676 --> 35:00.479
I think from the last
girl -- psh -- caught

35:00.513 --> 35:02.182
something.

35:02.214 --> 35:03.249
Caught something bad.

35:03.281 --> 35:06.319

Uh -- this shit -- I don't

35:09.355 --> 35:10.790
-- Come on, Fontaine.
Stop playing.

35:10.824 --> 35:12.226
It'd been acting up on
me like this where I can't

35:12.259 --> 35:13.394
even work this week.

35:13.427 --> 35:14.728
Especially this shit!

35:14.761 --> 35:16.330
It kicks in when I see
shit like this -- it kick

35:16.363 --> 35:18.899

35:18.932 --> 35:20.334
Oh, boy.

35:20.367 --> 35:21.335
I can't do it, unc.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.271
That shit coming out
my ass right now, Unc.

35:24.305 --> 35:26.808
Would you -- would you
-- This -- this is what

35:26.841 --> 35:28.277
I'm talking
about, Fontaine.

35:28.310 --> 35:29.879
Not this week.
Not this week.

35:29.911 --> 35:31.580
Not this --
give this to them.

35:31.614 --> 35:32.715
I can't, unc.

35:32.748 --> 35:35.284
Look, Fontaine
-- it's your forte!

35:35.317 --> 35:37.286
Now, I know what's up.

35:37.319 --> 35:39.255
Huh? How the hell is
this  my forte, man?

35:39.288 --> 35:41.358
Stop, okay?

35:41.390 --> 35:43.293
Everybody has a
role around here.

35:43.325 --> 35:45.228
Seth, what does he do?

35:45.262 --> 35:46.530
He's our white chocolate.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.365
Mike?
He brings in the big fish.

35:48.398 --> 35:51.300
You?
You're my wild card.

35:51.334 --> 35:52.437
Wild card, right.
Wow.

35:52.469 --> 35:54.305
Okay?

35:54.337 --> 35:55.439
You get -- you get all
of the hood rats --

35:55.473 --> 35:56.440
All of them.

35:56.473 --> 35:57.908
-- and the
clinically insane.

35:57.942 --> 35:59.744
Haha!
And anybody that's whoa,

35:59.777 --> 36:00.745
you lock that down.

36:00.777 --> 36:01.779
I do, huh?

36:05.784 --> 36:07.419
Okay, so I know it's already
 been a really long day.

36:07.452 --> 36:08.621
Yes.

36:08.653 --> 36:09.621
And we still have
that radio interview

36:09.655 --> 36:10.923
 that you have to go do.

36:10.956 --> 36:13.258
But I did build in a
two-hour window for you to

36:13.291 --> 36:15.326
have a break before we
have to go to the Boys and

36:15.360 --> 36:18.297
Girls Club for you
to read to the kids.

36:18.330 --> 36:19.298
You have to get
ready for your

36:19.332 --> 36:20.467
published authors banquet.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.468
Oh Michelle --
What you gonna wear?

36:21.500 --> 36:22.701
Let's just
put a pause in it.

36:22.734 --> 36:25.271
I just need two minutes
for peace and quiet.

36:25.305 --> 36:26.772
I get that way, too.

36:26.805 --> 36:28.608
I just have to learn
how to turn my brain off.

36:28.641 --> 36:29.409
Michelle --
You know,

36:29.443 --> 36:31.279
it just keeps
going and -- okay,

36:31.311 --> 36:33.313
peace and quiet.

36:33.347 --> 36:35.750
I can be -- I
can be quiet.

36:35.782 --> 36:37.284
I mean, I just, you know,
locking up and throwing

36:37.318 --> 36:38.786
away the key.

36:38.818 --> 36:40.321
It's not like I don't
have other things to do.

36:40.354 --> 36:41.555
Okay?

36:41.589 --> 36:43.357
Okay.

36:43.390 --> 36:46.058
Your phone's
ringing though.

36:45.093 --> 36:46.328
I have to answer it.

36:46.361 --> 36:47.328
Please.

36:47.361 --> 36:49.064
Hi, it's Ms.
Bryant's phone.

36:49.097 --> 36:50.899
How can I help you?

36:50.932 --> 36:52.367
Oh, hi Norma.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.437
I'm sorry -- Mrs.
Jenkins Hernandez.

36:55.471 --> 36:56.606
Uh no, she's actually
no time to speak

36:56.639 --> 36:57.807
with anybody right now.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.442
We're going over her
schedule for the day.

36:59.474 --> 37:01.511
I do, but we have some
things that we have to do

37:01.543 --> 37:02.679
today, so I'm sorry.

37:02.712 --> 37:04.448
She does not want to
speak with anybody.

37:04.481 --> 37:06.350
Yes.

37:06.383 --> 37:07.518
But you really don't have
to get that way because

37:07.550 --> 37:09.519
I'm only doing what
she asked me to do,

37:09.553 --> 37:11.855
and I always have to have
this conversation with you.

37:11.888 --> 37:14.625
Hold on.

37:14.658 --> 37:15.759
Hey, girl.

37:15.792 --> 37:19.097
I know, but she's
just doing her job.

37:19.130 --> 37:22.033
Sure, that sounds good.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.967
About an hour?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.705
Okay, Pallano's in an hour
-- I'll see you there.

37:26.737 --> 37:29.407
Oh, and I have to
tell you so much about

37:29.441 --> 37:31.776
you-know-who.

37:31.809 --> 37:33.878
Okay,
I'll see you there.

37:33.912 --> 37:35.614
All right, bye.

37:35.646 --> 37:37.682
Okay, pencil in lunch
with -- I got it --

37:37.715 --> 37:39.418
Pallano's.

37:39.450 --> 37:40.654
Thank you,
Miss Michelle.

37:40.687 --> 37:43.690
What would you without
me keeping you on time?

37:43.723 --> 37:45.958
Driving me crazy
with your schedule.

37:45.991 --> 37:47.361
we
have to go now,

37:47.393 --> 37:48.361
because you have to
get to that interview.

37:48.395 --> 37:49.396
All right, let's do it.

37:51.498 --> 37:52.967
I don't see
nothing out here.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.501
I mean, I've been
looking the whole time,

37:54.534 --> 37:55.969
I still ain't
seen nothin'.

37:56.003 --> 37:56.970
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

37:57.003 --> 37:57.804
whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:57.838 --> 37:58.639
Look at this booty.
Look at that!

37:58.673 --> 38:00.007
Look at that!
Look at that booty!

38:00.039 --> 38:02.008
Oh my God!
O-kay!

38:02.041 --> 38:04.512
Oh my God!
Hoo! Hoo!

38:04.546 --> 38:05.547
What you mean?

38:05.580 --> 38:06.582
You wouldn't know
about no ass like that, boy?

38:06.614 --> 38:07.750
Sure as hell I do, man.

38:07.783 --> 38:09.151
You guys are just
like too-too much booty.

38:09.183 --> 38:11.085
Too-too much booty?
Yeah. Too-too?

38:11.118 --> 38:12.421
Man, you white boys
wouldn't know how to put

38:12.453 --> 38:15.022
all your
you-know-what about that, boy.

38:15.055 --> 38:16.158
Oh, that's
hilarious, bro.

38:16.192 --> 38:17.092
I don't know
about no cakes.

38:17.126 --> 38:18.862
I'll be honest
though, he might be right.

38:18.894 --> 38:19.728
You know what I'm saying?

38:19.762 --> 38:21.398
We might over-exaggerate
a little bit.

38:21.431 --> 38:22.465
You know, but too-too
in the too-too -- uh!

38:22.498 --> 38:23.867
Too-too in the
too-too -- uh!

38:23.900 --> 38:24.867
too-too in the
too-too -- uh!

38:24.900 --> 38:26.735
Too much too-too
in the too-too!

38:26.769 --> 38:28.105
This dude likes booty-dos.

38:28.138 --> 38:29.273
You know what
a booty-do is? No.

38:29.305 --> 38:30.941
When the stomach sticks way
out like the booty do --

38:30.973 --> 38:32.542
Literally - he likes
pregnant chicks.

38:32.575 --> 38:33.543
If that's
what you want.

38:33.577 --> 38:34.544
I know how
to pick booty!

38:34.578 --> 38:36.013
Because
you're a field slave!

38:36.046 --> 38:37.515
You know how to
pick 'em, of course!

38:37.548 --> 38:38.515
You dang right!

38:38.549 --> 38:40.185
Speaking of
slaves -- Yeah?

38:40.217 --> 38:41.853
Can you cover for me?

38:41.886 --> 38:43.588
I got a boogie
tonight/ What?

38:43.621 --> 38:44.923
Cause you know
-- well, you know,

38:44.956 --> 38:47.025
me and Lisa, we've been
spending the whole time --

38:47.058 --> 38:48.559
And you wanna be
free if she calls?

38:48.592 --> 38:50.194
You can go
running right away?

38:50.228 --> 38:51.762
Hey, Lisa! You here?
I'm here for you.

38:51.795 --> 38:52.964
You really think that's a
good idea to be cancelling

38:52.997 --> 38:54.499
all your bookings, man?

38:54.533 --> 38:55.568
I mean, what if she's not?

38:55.600 --> 38:56.702
What if she's the one?

38:56.736 --> 38:57.770
What if she's the one and
you just put your mouth on

38:57.803 --> 38:58.771
my wife?

38:58.803 --> 38:59.872
What did you just say?

38:59.905 --> 39:01.040
That's an ass whooping
ready to happen.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.742
Nah. Hold up, hold up now.
wait a minute.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.610
What I'm hearing over here
is sounding like

39:04.643 --> 39:06.879
Uncle Frank's golden boy is
missing out on clients?

39:06.913 --> 39:08.982
Well, for a little old
girl with a black card?

39:09.014 --> 39:10.150
How do you know
she had a black card?

39:10.183 --> 39:11.518
You know me
and Unc, we tight.

39:11.551 --> 39:12.619
We -- we cool.
Whatever.

39:12.652 --> 39:14.487
Seth, you down?
Yeah, I got you, bro.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.157
Thank you.
Not a word to Frank!

39:16.189 --> 39:18.760
Man, I'm gonna tell you
like this.

39:18.793 --> 39:20.160
Don't tell me what I
need to tell people.

39:20.193 --> 39:21.595
Five dollars.

39:21.628 --> 39:22.764
Man, you can't bribe me
for no -- Ten dollars.

39:22.796 --> 39:24.631
That's a deal.
Deal. That's a deal.

39:24.664 --> 39:26.166
I got you on that.
I'm gonna take this up.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.268
But on the real
though, before I count this,

39:27.300 --> 39:30.171
you really doing a dangerous
thing right here, Mike.

39:30.205 --> 39:32.607
Mr. Fontaine
might be right, bro.

39:32.641 --> 39:34.009
Yep.
Are you guys serious?

39:34.042 --> 39:35.009
I mean, I know you
think you've got some

39:35.042 --> 39:36.077
feelings for this girl.

39:36.111 --> 39:37.513
But she might
be playing you, man.

39:37.545 --> 39:39.181
Taking up all your
time one minute,

39:39.214 --> 39:41.251
and the next minute
she just drops you.

39:41.284 --> 39:42.619
By then, you won't have
any clients to go back to.

39:42.651 --> 39:44.653
Listen, I
got this, okay?

39:44.686 --> 39:45.988
Between you and me.
I got this.

39:46.021 --> 39:47.958
It's all under control
-- all under control.

39:47.990 --> 39:50.193
All right?
Huh?

39:50.226 --> 39:52.629
Now, check this out.
 All right, that's for you.

39:52.663 --> 39:54.532
Let me see what
you're passing up here.

39:54.564 --> 39:56.200
Merry Christmas.
let me see that.

39:56.232 --> 39:57.634
Damn, you
passing up this one?

39:57.667 --> 39:59.636
Hey, you know,
surprise right?

39:59.669 --> 40:01.505
Ain't no fun if the
homies can't have that.

40:01.538 --> 40:02.939
Let me see that,
let me see that.

40:02.973 --> 40:05.544
Look Mike -- look man,
if you need help with your

40:05.577 --> 40:07.579
clients, you -- you
know I got your back, man.

40:07.612 --> 40:08.814
Oh, no, no.
This is not your type.

40:08.847 --> 40:10.115
You know your
type -- Precious.

40:10.148 --> 40:11.650
If she calls, I'm
gonna send her your way.

40:11.682 --> 40:13.784
If she likes her
biscuits and her chicken,

40:13.818 --> 40:14.853
and too-too booty,
you gotta feed her!

40:14.885 --> 40:16.122
You gotta feed her!

40:16.154 --> 40:17.557
Mike, Mike, I kept
that between us.

40:17.589 --> 40:18.557
Don't say that in
front of the white boy.

40:18.591 --> 40:19.558
Gotta feed her,
gotta feed her.

40:19.591 --> 40:20.559
You know what?

40:20.593 --> 40:21.361
Keep her off the heat though.

40:21.394 --> 40:22.729
You cold.
Keep her off the heat.

40:22.761 --> 40:23.729
I'm gonna tell my uncle
what you're doing.

40:23.763 --> 40:24.730
I got a
couple of midgets, too.

40:24.763 --> 40:25.798
I don't care
what you say.

40:25.830 --> 40:27.232
I know you like
dick-height chicks.

40:27.265 --> 40:30.904
Huh?

40:30.938 --> 40:32.907
Oh, hey Michelle
-- Yea, I know.

40:32.940 --> 40:35.608
She's just a
little overzealous.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.610
A little?

40:37.643 --> 40:38.744
But you know what?

40:38.779 --> 40:41.249
She gets the job done,
so it's probably good for you.

40:41.281 --> 40:42.684
She does.

40:42.716 --> 40:44.051
I don't know what I
would do without her.

40:44.084 --> 40:45.887
I would be late
to everything.

40:48.656 --> 40:51.159
By the way, why do you
insist on continuing to

40:51.191 --> 40:53.728
use your
ex-husband's last name?

40:53.761 --> 40:56.231
I mean, don't you think
Jenkins Hernandez sounds

40:56.264 --> 40:57.766
a little funny?

40:57.799 --> 41:00.735
Of course I do, but I
know it pisses him off.

41:00.768 --> 41:02.137
Right, right.
So

41:03.605 --> 41:05.341
-- Refresh my
memory -- why did you

41:05.374 --> 41:07.744
marry this guy in
the first place,

41:07.776 --> 41:10.046
and how did you manage to
make it last for all of

41:10.079 --> 41:13.080
two months?

41:12.115 --> 41:14.785
I married him
because he made me laugh.

41:14.818 --> 41:17.755
He just didn't know how
to keep it in his pants.

41:17.788 --> 41:19.724
That's what I get for
marrying a

41:19.757 --> 41:23.226
Mexican immigrant with
money, right?

41:23.259 --> 41:25.763
What you got
was $20 Million,

41:25.795 --> 41:29.635
three fabulous cars, and a big,
beautiful house.

41:29.668 --> 41:32.738
Wait a minute, I thought
you said he was Peruvian?

41:32.771 --> 41:34.273
Whatever.
Okay,

41:34.305 --> 41:37.275
so listen, so there's another
guy who I want you to meet.

41:37.309 --> 41:39.278
Ladies,
enjoy your dessert.

41:39.311 --> 41:41.214
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

41:41.247 --> 41:43.783
He is muy caliente.

41:43.815 --> 41:45.718
Oh, sorry --
off the market.

41:45.752 --> 41:47.320
Since when?

41:47.352 --> 41:48.787
Hello?
Since Michael.

41:48.821 --> 41:50.123
Yeah, but this
new guy, he's great.

41:50.156 --> 41:51.291
He is perfect for you.

41:51.323 --> 41:53.326
He is absolutely gorgeous.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.796
Well, Michael is great
and perfect for me and

41:55.829 --> 41:57.765
absolutely gorgeous.

41:57.798 --> 41:59.834
Yeah, but why put all
your eggs in one basket?

41:59.867 --> 42:06.408
You are the one who hooked
me up with Michael, right?

42:06.441 --> 42:08.843
Yes, but I didn't
expect you to go all gaga

42:08.877 --> 42:10.312
over the guy just
after one date.

42:10.345 --> 42:13.147
Two dates and
a four-hour phone conversation.

42:13.180 --> 42:14.682
Lisa, come on.

42:14.716 --> 42:15.683
Come on, Norma!

42:15.716 --> 42:16.719
You come on.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.755
I mean, unlike
some people,

42:19.789 --> 42:22.992
I don't have to sample every
flavor in the yogurt shop.

42:23.025 --> 42:26.829
I find the one that I
like and I go with it.

42:26.862 --> 42:28.332
What?
You hit a homerun.

42:28.365 --> 42:30.834
I thought you'd be
patting yourself

42:30.866 --> 42:32.370
on the back right about now.

42:35.338 --> 42:38.374
Wait -- do you know
something about Michael I don't?

42:38.408 --> 42:39.844
He's not married, is he?

42:39.877 --> 42:41.212
Lisa, no.

42:41.244 --> 42:43.380
But he's not the kind
of guy -- Is he gay? Bi?

42:43.413 --> 42:45.949
No!
Okay.

42:45.982 --> 42:48.185
So then he is
perfect for me.

42:48.219 --> 42:54.694
And thanks to you, I've
found my Mr. Right...

42:54.727 --> 42:56.663
and I'm gonna go for it.

43:02.167 --> 43:03.135
I cried every time.

43:03.167 --> 43:04.371
At the same point?

43:04.404 --> 43:05.772
But the movie just
pisses me off in general,

43:05.804 --> 43:07.841
because -- you promise
me you won't let go?

43:07.873 --> 43:08.875
Promise me you
won't let go?

43:08.909 --> 43:11.144
She had this dude in
the water and she let go!

43:11.176 --> 43:12.379
I'm like -- I know.

43:12.411 --> 43:13.379
And then there was like
that -- These chicks

43:13.413 --> 43:14.380
ain't loyal.

43:14.413 --> 43:15.381
You know what I'm saying?

43:15.415 --> 43:16.383
Well, that was nasty.

43:16.416 --> 43:17.384
I cried on that
[INDISCERNIBLE].

43:17.418 --> 43:19.220
I'll never let go.

43:19.787 --> 43:20.755
Hahaha!

43:20.787 --> 43:22.055
That was a good line.

43:22.088 --> 43:23.490
That was a good line.

43:23.523 --> 43:26.326
So you know I am that -- I
am a romance type of guy,

43:26.360 --> 43:27.327
you know what I mean.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.730
How you doing, Betty?

43:28.763 --> 43:32.400
Uh, could I get two
tickets for He's Mine,

43:32.433 --> 43:33.401
Not Yours?

43:33.435 --> 43:34.902
Sure,
that'll be $13.50.

43:34.935 --> 43:35.903
Thirteen fifty?

43:35.937 --> 43:36.904
Cool.

43:36.937 --> 43:38.773
Do I know you?

43:38.806 --> 43:39.742
Have I seen
this guy before?

43:39.775 --> 43:40.844
I think he was here
last week with a white

43:40.876 --> 43:41.710
girl.

43:41.744 --> 43:42.911
I was here last
week with a white girl?

43:42.945 --> 43:44.814
Got another guy,
got another guy.

43:44.847 --> 43:45.749
I get that all the time.

43:45.782 --> 43:47.050
I look like every man.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.251
I'm more of a -- it's
a recognizable face.

43:49.284 --> 43:51.353
Are you gonna pay?

43:51.387 --> 43:52.790
You have to pay me
before I give you the

43:52.823 --> 43:53.824
tickets.

43:53.857 --> 43:54.825
Oh, right.

43:54.857 --> 43:55.859
Here -- there you go.

43:56.794 --> 43:57.795
So thanks for
hating on me,

43:57.828 --> 43:58.796
brother.

43:58.828 --> 43:59.796
Uh, I appreciate that.

43:59.830 --> 44:00.598
Enjoy your show.
Thank you.

44:00.631 --> 44:02.066
Appreciate that.
Nice to meet you!

44:02.098 --> 44:03.133
Mm-hm.
For the first time.

44:03.167 --> 44:04.135
Both of you
guys -- haters.

44:04.168 --> 44:14.211
Both of you guys.
It's cool.

44:14.244 --> 44:24.256
Both of you guys.
It's cool.

44:24.290 --> 44:34.234
Both of you guys.
It's cool.

44:34.266 --> 44:44.278
Both of you guys.
It's cool.

44:44.312 --> 44:56.826
Both of you guys.
It's cool.

44:56.859 --> 45:02.864
So she
says since my first two

45:02.897 --> 45:04.300
novels did so
well regionally,

45:04.334 --> 45:06.837
they want to expand their
distribution to a broader

45:06.869 --> 45:08.904
market and do a
national release,

45:08.937 --> 45:11.006
a publishing campaign
-- the whole nine,

45:11.039 --> 45:13.375
and that comes with
a very nice advance.

45:13.408 --> 45:15.177
I kept my cool in
front of her of course,

45:15.211 --> 45:17.547
but Michelle and I got
outside and damn near lost

45:17.580 --> 45:19.349
our minds!

45:19.382 --> 45:21.151
I'm so excited!

45:21.185 --> 45:23.888
Oh yeah.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.522
I'm excited for you guys.

45:25.556 --> 45:26.891
Are you sure?

45:26.924 --> 45:28.060
Huh?

45:28.092 --> 45:29.393
You seem distracted.
Is everything okay?

45:29.427 --> 45:31.296
Yeah,
everything is fine.

45:31.329 --> 45:36.301
You're you -- you
really deserve it.

45:36.334 --> 45:42.909
Well, can I -- can I
just be straightforward?

45:42.942 --> 45:44.344
Yeah, of course.

45:44.377 --> 45:46.145
there's
something happening here.

45:46.178 --> 45:48.547
I think we both feel
like something special

45:48.580 --> 45:49.882
happening here, right?

45:49.915 --> 45:51.350
I think so.
Don't -- don't you?

45:51.384 --> 45:53.254
Yeah, yes.

45:53.286 --> 45:54.888
No question.

45:54.922 --> 45:57.958
I just -- you know, I find
myself in that place where

45:57.990 --> 46:00.661
it's like, What
are we doing?

46:00.693 --> 46:02.028
What does it all mean?

46:02.061 --> 46:04.999
How -- where do
we go from here,

46:05.033 --> 46:06.234
you know?

46:06.267 --> 46:09.370
Like I -- sure, we've
both had our share of

46:09.403 --> 46:12.606
relationships and have
been hurt and hurt people.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.142
I understand all that.

46:15.576 --> 46:21.650
But I-I just -- I want
to go through things with you.

46:22.217 --> 46:24.220
I want to laugh.

46:24.253 --> 46:28.893
I want to do
normal things -- bake.

46:30.126 --> 46:31.060
I-I want to do a
kids' book together.

46:31.093 --> 46:32.461
Obviously, I'm
not the writer,

46:32.495 --> 46:37.000
but I would -- and I know
that's rushing way ahead,

46:37.033 --> 46:39.069
which is why I'm
asking you this,

46:39.102 --> 46:41.105
because since we've met,
I haven't dated anybody.

46:41.137 --> 46:42.540
I haven't even
thought about it.

46:42.572 --> 46:44.241
I actually think I fell in
love with you as soon as I

46:44.275 --> 46:45.476
laid eyes on you.

46:45.509 --> 46:48.045
And it was instant -- I
knew right then that was

46:48.078 --> 46:50.281
-- that you're
my soul mate,

46:50.313 --> 46:52.383
and that we've
been here before.

46:52.416 --> 46:54.218
I usually say all the
right things and never

46:54.251 --> 46:57.322
mean them, and I'm sure
I'm saying all the wrong

46:57.356 --> 46:58.590
things.

46:58.622 --> 47:02.394
But for the first time,
all the wrong things are

47:02.427 --> 47:04.431
the truth.

47:05.498 --> 47:09.402
So I don't
know what to do.

47:09.435 --> 47:10.670
I can't eat, I
can't sleep,

47:10.703 --> 47:14.341
can't -- I -- you'll
have to stop me cause I'm

47:14.373 --> 47:15.442
rambling.

47:15.476 --> 47:18.146
I'm -- it's just
been driving me crazy.

47:19.313 --> 47:20.747
So I'm gonna need
you to say something,

47:20.780 --> 47:23.050
please.

47:23.450 --> 47:24.619
Wow.

47:25.119 --> 47:26.321
Wow.

47:27.689 --> 47:28.757
Was I out of line
or should -- No,

47:28.790 --> 47:30.158
are you serious?

47:30.190 --> 47:32.761
Well --
Did you mean it,

47:32.794 --> 47:34.062
what you just said?

47:34.094 --> 47:36.332
All of it, Lisa.

47:40.536 --> 47:42.304
Michael,
don't play with me.

47:42.338 --> 47:47.010
I swear on
everything that is sacred,

47:47.809 --> 47:52.048
and I mean
every single word.

48:10.201 --> 48:13.170
I'll close the door.

48:13.204 --> 48:16.742
I know that earlier,
when I said if you want to

48:16.774 --> 48:20.713
watch a movie or just been
enjoying watching you in

48:20.745 --> 48:28.254
this dress, so --
Okay,

48:34.427 --> 48:38.698
see now know --
there's the highway.

48:38.730 --> 48:41.735
We're
on the tarmac right now,

48:41.769 --> 48:44.504
about to take
off for taxiing.

48:44.537 --> 48:48.309
And I just
want you to know.

48:51.645 --> 48:55.551
Wait, I just want you
to know--time out--I know.

48:56.217 --> 48:58.386
I like you and
I respect you,

48:58.420 --> 49:00.589
and I feel
funny in my stomach,

49:00.621 --> 49:02.857
like that -- that shit.

49:02.891 --> 49:04.594
Are you sure about this?

49:04.626 --> 49:05.594
Mm-hm.

49:05.628 --> 49:06.595
Are you sure?

49:06.628 --> 49:07.596
Yes.

49:07.630 --> 49:08.597
Are you sure?

49:08.631 --> 49:09.599
Yes.

49:09.631 --> 49:12.101
Okay, come on.

49:16.272 --> 49:17.307
Y-yes.

49:17.341 --> 49:19.275
Look, I'm sorry.

49:19.308 --> 49:21.312
He will not miss
another appointment!

49:21.344 --> 49:24.614
Uh look, we don't do that
at MyMr.Right -- (phone

49:24.647 --> 49:25.815
ringing).

49:25.848 --> 49:27.485
Uh, okay -- hang on.

49:27.519 --> 49:28.753
Hello?

49:28.786 --> 49:30.287
Yes.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.456
Yes, this is Frank.

49:31.488 --> 49:34.126
Absolut- -- ah!

49:34.159 --> 49:36.728
I'm -- look,
ma'am, I know.

49:36.760 --> 49:39.798
I -- get -- hold on.

49:39.832 --> 49:44.203
How
did you get my cell?

49:45.171 --> 49:47.672
Look, this is not
Michael's -- Frank,

49:47.705 --> 49:50.242
Michael Martin stood
me up on two dates!

49:50.276 --> 49:51.644
Sent some little
troll in his place.

49:51.677 --> 49:53.480
And he cancelled
on me three times!

49:53.512 --> 49:55.315
Sent some white
boy in his place!

49:55.347 --> 49:56.215
Oh!

49:56.248 --> 49:57.182
Sorry, not that I
don't do white men.

49:57.217 --> 49:58.519
But sending one to my
big momma's wedding?

49:58.552 --> 49:59.452
Uh-uh!

49:59.487 --> 50:00.521
I don't want to have to
take my business

50:00.554 --> 50:01.521
somewhere else.

50:01.554 --> 50:02.522
Mm, I heard that.

50:02.556 --> 50:03.457
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

50:03.491 --> 50:04.626
Ladies, ladies,
ladies, let's not jump to

50:04.658 --> 50:05.926
conclusions now.

50:05.959 --> 50:09.296
Y'all know Frankie is
always taking care of you

50:09.330 --> 50:10.265
-- both of you!

50:10.298 --> 50:11.332
Haven't I?

50:11.832 --> 50:12.799
Haven't I?

50:12.832 --> 50:13.800
Yes.

50:13.834 --> 50:14.801
Until lately.

50:14.834 --> 50:16.204
So?

50:16.237 --> 50:19.274
Get this -- I
have a new guy.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.210
This guy is better
than Michael ever was!

50:21.242 --> 50:22.710
I don't want some
second-rate Michael!

50:22.744 --> 50:24.246
I want the real thing.

50:24.279 --> 50:25.481
And if I don't, I want
all my money back

50:25.514 --> 50:26.615
-- every penny.

50:26.648 --> 50:27.684
Mm-hm, me too.

50:27.716 --> 50:29.552
Let me tell
y'all something.

50:29.586 --> 50:31.955
What Frank is not going
to do is give no damn

50:31.988 --> 50:34.224
refunds, okay?

50:34.256 --> 50:35.158
You ain't
getting a refund,

50:36.359 --> 50:37.294
you ain't
getting a damn refund.

50:37.327 --> 50:38.128
Oh, you're going to
give me my money back --

50:38.160 --> 50:39.195
You -- let me
tell you something,

50:39.229 --> 50:39.764
Laverne and Shirley --
Let me tell you how you're

50:39.797 --> 50:41.565
giving me my money back.

50:41.598 --> 50:42.532
You gonna give me my
money back!

50:42.565 --> 50:43.533
Oh, whoa, whoa!
Hold on now!

50:43.567 --> 50:44.802
Wait a second there.

50:44.835 --> 50:45.802
You ain't gotta -- the
violence is not called

50:45.835 --> 50:47.337
for, okay?

50:47.371 --> 50:49.907
So you know, since you
are willing to take steps

50:49.940 --> 50:53.345
beyond normality,
we'll give you a refund,

50:53.378 --> 50:54.345
okay?

50:54.378 --> 50:55.346
Thank you.

50:55.380 --> 50:56.648
You, on the
other hand ma'am,

50:56.680 --> 50:58.216
will not get anything.

51:12.931 --> 51:15.401
So why are
we meeting here?

51:15.434 --> 51:17.503
Because I got
people watching me.

51:17.537 --> 51:19.673
Listening to us --
all types of ears.

51:19.706 --> 51:21.541
When you Frank,
people be all over you.

51:21.575 --> 51:24.278
Matter of fact,
you wearing a wire?

51:24.311 --> 51:26.380
No, I'm not
wearing a wire.

51:26.412 --> 51:28.917
Look like you
got an underwire.

51:30.350 --> 51:32.319
So because of your girl,
I've been losing clients

51:32.352 --> 51:34.421
left and right all day.

51:34.455 --> 51:36.758
You don't know what it's
like for these bit- these

51:36.790 --> 51:39.594
ladies to be calling and
-- and dropping by the

51:39.628 --> 51:41.264
office,
looking for Michael.

51:41.297 --> 51:42.398
"Where's Michael
at?" Michael this,

51:42.431 --> 51:43.398
Michael that!

51:43.431 --> 51:44.399
Not good for business.

51:44.432 --> 51:46.735
Okay look, I know that
you're losing money and

51:46.769 --> 51:48.271
everything like
that and I apologize,

51:48.304 --> 51:49.771
but -- I'm losing
boatloads of money!

51:49.804 --> 51:51.741
Michael is my top draw.

51:51.774 --> 51:53.943
But ever since your girl
Lisa came into his life

51:53.977 --> 51:55.444
and got his
nose wide open,

51:55.477 --> 51:58.348
he all of a sudden don't
want to take no clients!

51:59.448 --> 52:00.983
Look, you know
what as well as I do,

52:01.017 --> 52:03.487
these type of
relationships don't even last.

52:03.521 --> 52:05.623
True, and that's
exactly what I tried to

52:05.655 --> 52:06.824
tell Lisa.

52:06.857 --> 52:11.362
What if -- hm --
what if they split up?

52:11.395 --> 52:12.396
What?

52:12.429 --> 52:15.367
I mean, what
if they split up?

52:16.468 --> 52:18.437
Okay, if they
were to break up then,

52:18.470 --> 52:20.406
Lisa would be heartbroken
and then she would blame me.

52:20.439 --> 52:21.406
Then what?

52:21.439 --> 52:23.075
What am I supposed to do?

52:23.108 --> 52:24.843
Do-do-do Frank look
like he give a damn about

52:24.876 --> 52:26.312
what you supposed to do?

52:26.345 --> 52:27.647
Frank don't care!

52:27.679 --> 52:29.515
Frank care about Michael,
because when Michael is

52:29.549 --> 52:31.351
feeling good, the
ladies is feeling good.

52:31.384 --> 52:32.351
When Michael
ain't feeling good,

52:32.384 --> 52:33.352
well guess what?

52:33.386 --> 52:34.420
Frank lose money.

52:34.453 --> 52:35.621
When Frank lose money,
everybody unhappy because

52:35.654 --> 52:37.323
Frank wilds out!

52:38.558 --> 52:39.860
So it looks like you
and I both have a vested

52:39.892 --> 52:41.361
interest into seeing this
little love charade come

52:41.394 --> 52:42.362
to an end.

52:42.396 --> 52:43.731
We do.

52:44.731 --> 52:46.700
So what do you suggest?

52:46.733 --> 52:51.004
Hm -- I have a plan.

52:51.739 --> 52:53.841
But I need you.

52:54.408 --> 52:55.543
You in?

52:56.543 --> 52:57.511
I'm in.

52:57.545 --> 52:59.380
Okay, okay.

52:59.413 --> 53:00.614
You in, I'm in.

53:00.647 --> 53:01.682
You know,
that's a good thing,

53:01.716 --> 53:02.784
you know.

53:02.817 --> 53:05.054
Maybe we can get
in, know what I mean?

53:05.086 --> 53:06.488
You know what?

53:06.521 --> 53:08.690
Just text me later, okay?

53:08.724 --> 53:11.526
Like what
time, you think?

53:11.559 --> 53:12.561
You got a good
looking mouth though,

53:12.595 --> 53:13.563
I'll tell you that.

53:13.595 --> 53:14.563
Ugh.

53:14.597 --> 53:16.533
Mouth on this.

53:16.565 --> 53:18.435
My -- oh, whoa.
Okay.

53:18.468 --> 53:21.672
A mouth on
this, all right.

53:21.705 --> 53:25.076
That thing know she fine.
Goddamn.

53:27.411 --> 53:29.747
Hey, girl!

53:29.780 --> 53:31.882
I'm good.

53:32.784 --> 53:35.086
I'm glad you called.

53:35.119 --> 53:37.756
Listen, you
wanna grab a coffee?

53:37.789 --> 53:42.828
I uh -- I need
to talk to you.

53:42.861 --> 53:45.464
Okay.

53:45.497 --> 53:49.134
I'll see you in a sec.

53:55.474 --> 53:56.509
Haha, my man.

53:56.543 --> 53:57.510
What's going on, sir?

53:57.543 --> 53:58.944
I see you, girl.

53:58.978 --> 54:00.614
Haha, Money Mike!
Hey.

54:00.646 --> 54:01.681
Hey, man.

54:01.713 --> 54:03.885
My man.

54:03.917 --> 54:04.885
Hey, uh is Sarah pregnant?

54:04.919 --> 54:05.953
Something.

54:05.986 --> 54:07.555
She gained a
little bit of weight!

54:07.588 --> 54:08.522
Yeah,
getting swoll, right?

54:08.555 --> 54:09.723
I'm not sending over
no more Rusty's Pizza.

54:09.756 --> 54:10.724
No more Rusty's Pizza.

54:10.758 --> 54:11.725
It's your fault.

54:11.758 --> 54:12.726
I know, I know.

54:12.760 --> 54:13.727
It's really your fault.

54:13.760 --> 54:14.695
She's got a cute face.

54:14.729 --> 54:15.731
Anyways -- I kind of
like her a little thick

54:15.764 --> 54:17.065
like that, you know.

54:17.098 --> 54:18.065
But yeah, man.

54:18.099 --> 54:19.568
What's going on, man?

54:19.601 --> 54:22.503
I was thinking the other
day that all the ladies

54:22.536 --> 54:23.938
love Money Mike.

54:23.971 --> 54:25.573
Aah!
Don't hurt me!

54:25.607 --> 54:26.574
How you do it?

54:26.607 --> 54:28.477
AAAAAAH!

54:28.510 --> 54:29.478
They love it.

54:29.512 --> 54:30.479
They love it.

54:30.512 --> 54:31.480
They love it.

54:31.513 --> 54:32.782
All the ladies'
man, except one.

54:32.814 --> 54:33.782
Which one?

54:33.816 --> 54:36.151
Oh, man --
what was that?

54:36.184 --> 54:37.786
Oh, a Lisa Bryant.

54:37.820 --> 54:38.787
Li-?

54:38.820 --> 54:39.789
Yeah.

54:39.822 --> 54:40.790
Lisa Bryant?

54:40.824 --> 54:41.926
Yeah.

54:41.958 --> 54:42.993
Oh, Lisa Bryant?

54:43.025 --> 54:43.993
You remember that --?

54:44.027 --> 54:45.629
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:45.661 --> 54:46.496
The like -- the whole
month thingy that -- yeah.

54:46.529 --> 54:47.665
Yeah, what -- Yeah.

54:47.697 --> 54:49.833
What'd she say?

54:49.866 --> 54:51.101
I know this is
gonna be crazy,

54:51.135 --> 54:52.637
because I -- I couldn't
even wrap my mind around

54:52.669 --> 54:54.606
it when she hit
me with this.

54:54.639 --> 54:59.644
So she seemed to think

54:59.677 --> 55:03.583
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

55:03.616 --> 55:07.487
She thinks you're
falling in love with her!

55:07.520 --> 55:08.621
Right?

55:08.654 --> 55:10.256
Really?

55:10.288 --> 55:11.823
Yes!

55:11.857 --> 55:13.993
It's crazy, right?

55:14.026 --> 55:15.662
Crazy.

55:15.695 --> 55:16.630
Crazy, dude.

55:16.662 --> 55:17.430
Nuts!

55:17.463 --> 55:18.865
That's what I
tried to tell her!

55:18.898 --> 55:20.800
I'm like, "That's not the
way we get down!"

55:20.833 --> 55:22.134
At all.

55:22.168 --> 55:23.269
Especially
not Money Mike,

55:23.302 --> 55:25.538
not the cornerstone
of MyMr.Right.com!

55:25.572 --> 55:27.008
What?

55:27.040 --> 55:30.944
But you know, I mean she
said that -- that she felt

55:30.977 --> 55:34.581
like you know, you
were getting a little too

55:34.614 --> 55:35.883
serious.

55:35.917 --> 55:37.585
She even said that
she -- you know,

55:37.618 --> 55:38.653
she did kind
of initiate it.

55:38.685 --> 55:41.690
I guess she wanted to
pretend that it was real,

55:41.722 --> 55:42.891
you know. But --

55:42.925 --> 55:44.059
you know.

55:44.092 --> 55:45.126
Wow.

55:45.159 --> 55:46.561
I...

55:46.594 --> 55:47.529
It's crazy, right?

55:47.563 --> 55:49.131
Deep shit.

55:49.164 --> 55:51.701
It ain't
you -- it's her!

55:51.734 --> 55:52.802
It's her.

55:52.834 --> 55:54.905
She trying to
infiltrate your world.

55:54.937 --> 55:57.673
Because I know one thing
about Money Mike: Money

55:57.707 --> 55:59.743
Mike is not gonna let
feelings come between

55:59.776 --> 56:03.047
business, right?

56:03.079 --> 56:04.581
Never.

56:04.614 --> 56:07.317
She even cancelled like
the rest of the month.

56:07.351 --> 56:09.186
She just like, "Yeah,
I'm good." You know?

56:09.219 --> 56:10.588
She said -- she
said it like that?

56:10.621 --> 56:11.822
Like, "I'm good"?

56:11.855 --> 56:13.090
I -- I was talking
to her on the phone,

56:13.123 --> 56:14.090
but it looked like
her hands went up like,

56:14.123 --> 56:17.228
"I'm good!" Yeah, man.

56:17.262 --> 56:20.666
Anyway -- anyway
man, so if I was you,

56:20.698 --> 56:24.001
I -- they can't
never stop cold turkey,

56:24.035 --> 56:26.038
so she's probably
going, you know,

56:26.071 --> 56:27.707
try to hit you up.

56:27.739 --> 56:29.274
You know, still
try to reach out.

56:29.308 --> 56:32.712
Man, I suggest you
just -- just push back, man.

56:32.744 --> 56:34.614
You know what I'm saying?

56:34.647 --> 56:35.882
See that?

56:35.915 --> 56:37.683
You have to push back
-- create some space.

56:37.717 --> 56:39.954
See, cause what
these women do,

56:39.986 --> 56:43.090
they try to
infiltrate your space.

56:43.122 --> 56:45.592
See, you -- you
like the juggernaut,

56:45.626 --> 56:46.627
you understand me?

56:46.660 --> 56:48.662
You got all that and
they try to break inside,

56:48.695 --> 56:50.731
but the juggernaut
don't allow that.

56:50.764 --> 56:52.067
You Money Mike, baby.

56:52.100 --> 56:53.268
I'm Money Mike.

56:53.301 --> 56:55.303
You Money Mike!

56:55.335 --> 56:56.670
You know what I'm saying?

56:56.703 --> 56:57.871
Ha!

56:57.904 --> 56:59.774
That's what
I'm talking about.

56:59.806 --> 57:01.042
She'll try to
call you though.

57:01.074 --> 57:02.743
Don't even -- you
know what I'm saying?

57:02.777 --> 57:04.780
You gotta -- you
gotta accept all that.

57:04.813 --> 57:05.881
See how I'm -- see that?

57:05.914 --> 57:07.083
I hear you, babe.

57:07.115 --> 57:08.083
Come on, man.

57:08.117 --> 57:09.752
Right?

57:09.784 --> 57:10.619
See you, boy.

57:10.653 --> 57:11.621
All right.

57:11.653 --> 57:12.954
All right!

57:12.988 --> 57:15.158
Haha, my man, Money Mike.

57:15.190 --> 57:18.995
Money Mike.

57:19.763 --> 57:20.730
Mm.

57:20.763 --> 57:22.064
What?

57:22.098 --> 57:23.734
To you, my friend,
who will soon be New York

57:23.767 --> 57:25.902
Times Best-selling Author.

57:25.935 --> 57:28.139
Why thank you, my dear.

57:28.172 --> 57:30.108
But it's a little
early for that,

57:30.141 --> 57:31.142
don't you think?

57:31.175 --> 57:32.677
Mm-mm, not at all.

57:32.710 --> 57:34.177
They don't release a book
nationally unless they

57:34.210 --> 57:35.779
think it's
bound for success.

57:35.813 --> 57:37.148
Trust me.

57:37.181 --> 57:38.749
Have I steered
you wrong yet?

57:38.782 --> 57:42.120
No, you've
been spot on, actually.

57:42.153 --> 57:43.121
Thank you.

57:43.154 --> 57:44.656
Especially
with Michael.

57:44.689 --> 57:48.660
Girl, my life is so
blessed right now to have

57:48.694 --> 57:50.663
the best friend
I could ask for,

57:50.696 --> 57:53.833
a major book release,
and the man of my dreams.

57:53.866 --> 57:56.869
And to think I came this
close to hiring a date --

57:56.902 --> 57:58.638
terrible.

57:59.905 --> 58:01.674
But now we have to
find your Mr. Right.

58:01.708 --> 58:04.011
Lisa, I need to talk
to you about Michael.

58:04.044 --> 58:06.213
Yes, let's
talk about him.

58:06.245 --> 58:09.050
Honey, I know you're
crazy about the guy.

58:09.082 --> 58:10.718
I am.

58:10.751 --> 58:12.720
I am.

58:12.752 --> 58:15.357
Michael isn't the
man you think he is.

58:15.389 --> 58:20.027
My friend -- the one who
introduced me to him --

58:20.060 --> 58:21.696
told me that if you're
looking for something

58:21.730 --> 58:25.067
long-term,
Michael isn't your guy.

58:25.099 --> 58:27.336
Okay Norma, I know you
think I'm taking things

58:27.369 --> 58:28.838
too fast with
Michael, but -- Lisa,

58:28.870 --> 58:30.006
just listen please.

58:30.039 --> 58:31.807
Michael is
going to hurt you.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.842
He has this track record
of leading women on and

58:33.876 --> 58:34.877
right when
things get serious,

58:34.910 --> 58:36.312
he moves on.

58:36.345 --> 58:37.780
My friend knows.

58:37.812 --> 58:39.049
Well, how
does she know?

58:39.082 --> 58:43.920
She -- her
sister dated him.

58:43.953 --> 58:46.989
Okay, so if
he's so awful,

58:47.022 --> 58:48.825
why did she have you
set me up with him?

58:48.859 --> 58:49.826
Come on, Lisa.

58:49.859 --> 58:50.727
We've been through this!

58:50.761 --> 58:51.930
It was supposed to
be a one-time thing,

58:51.963 --> 58:53.198
just a date for
your birthday.

58:53.231 --> 58:55.166
Nobody expected you
to fall for the guy.

58:55.198 --> 58:56.200
I don't believe you.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.001
Fine!

58:58.034 --> 59:00.938
Fine, then
don't believe me.

59:00.972 --> 59:03.509
But just be careful, okay?

59:03.542 --> 59:06.911
The last thing I want
is to see you get hurt.

59:06.944 --> 59:08.446
Right.

59:08.480 --> 59:12.218
It's just a matter of
time before he starts to

59:12.250 --> 59:13.953
distance himself from you.

59:13.986 --> 59:15.956
He -- don't say I
didn't warn you.

59:15.989 --> 59:17.289
You know what, Norma?

59:17.322 --> 59:18.824
Maybe it's time you found
a man that you can be

59:18.858 --> 59:19.960
happy with so you can
stop trying to ruin other

59:19.992 --> 59:21.827
peoples' happiness.

59:21.860 --> 59:23.864
This is stupid.

59:23.896 --> 59:26.733
I'm outta here.

59:52.028 --> 59:54.564
You have reached a number
that is no longer in service.

59:54.597 --> 59:56.966
Please check the number
and try your call again.

59:56.999 --> 59:58.968
Thank you.

01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:55.326
I don't get it, Norma.
Two weeks and not a word.

01:02:55.358 --> 01:02:58.128
I tried to tell you.

01:02:58.162 --> 01:03:00.331
I know.
I know.

01:03:00.363 --> 01:03:02.700
I'm sorry I
didn't listen to you.

01:03:02.734 --> 01:03:06.038
I'm very sorry I
reacted the way I did.

01:03:06.071 --> 01:03:07.706
It's all right.

01:03:07.738 --> 01:03:12.310
That's what guys do.
They all play games.

01:03:12.343 --> 01:03:16.115
I really
thought this was it.

01:03:20.186 --> 01:03:24.090
He's obviously a jerk.

01:03:24.123 --> 01:03:28.997
Thank you, girl.

01:03:37.336 --> 01:03:39.040
All right, oh, no, no.

01:03:39.074 --> 01:03:40.342
We got you covered.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:43.311
Whatever you need;
it's MyMr.Right.com!

01:03:43.344 --> 01:03:47.549
No, he'll
be there and on time.

01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:50.418
All right, gonna be great.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.820
I know, I know.

01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:53.589
Yeah.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:54.824
Well?

01:03:54.856 --> 01:03:56.492
What's up, Mike?
Good to see you, man.

01:03:56.524 --> 01:03:58.126
Good to see you.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.228
What's going on?

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.228
Customers complaining
again, or what?

01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:01.530
No, no, no, no.

01:04:01.564 --> 01:04:02.532
I just wanted
to see you, man.

01:04:02.565 --> 01:04:03.533
How are you?

01:04:03.567 --> 01:04:05.369
Pfft, good.

01:04:05.402 --> 01:04:07.337
Never better.

01:04:07.369 --> 01:04:08.337
Mike?

01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:09.339
Yeah?

01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:12.341
I know you, okay?

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:13.710
Good friend.

01:04:13.743 --> 01:04:17.749
Look, I know
this business could mess

01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:18.749
with your head
sometimes, man,

01:04:18.782 --> 01:04:22.119
especially -- especially
when the puppet master

01:04:22.153 --> 01:04:24.222
becomes the puppet.

01:04:24.254 --> 01:04:26.390
But the sooner you can
get back in the game,

01:04:26.423 --> 01:04:29.394
the better you'll be,
you know what I mean?

01:04:29.428 --> 01:04:31.096
Hm.

01:04:31.129 --> 01:04:32.097
You feeling me?

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.165
Yeah, I feel you.

01:04:33.198 --> 01:04:34.866
You ready to
get back to work?

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.102
Ready to go, baby!

01:04:36.134 --> 01:04:37.469
Melts in your mouth.

01:04:37.502 --> 01:04:38.804
Not in your hand.

01:04:38.838 --> 01:04:40.640
I tell you
what -- I tell you want.

01:04:40.673 --> 01:04:43.376
I got -- I got the
perfect booking for you.

01:04:43.409 --> 01:04:45.278
Check that out.

01:04:45.311 --> 01:04:46.713
Huh?

01:04:46.746 --> 01:04:47.881
Yeah?

01:04:47.914 --> 01:04:50.383
Mm-hmm.

01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:51.585
Right?

01:04:51.618 --> 01:04:52.819
Okay.

01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:54.154
I'll shoot that to
your email -- show her

01:04:54.187 --> 01:04:56.123
a good time, man and
you have some fun.

01:04:56.156 --> 01:04:57.124
My man.

01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:58.159
Hey, man.

01:04:58.192 --> 01:04:59.393
Yeah?

01:04:59.426 --> 01:05:02.831
Good to have you
back on you're A-game.

01:05:02.864 --> 01:05:06.268
Good to be back.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.183
The
girls are looking good.

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:22.285
I need some help
in your department.

01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:24.319
Thank you.
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

01:05:24.352 --> 01:05:25.921
I'm glad I was finally
able to tie you down for

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.324
drinks, Miss
Big-Time Author.

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.192
Well, what can I say?

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:30.528
Wait, hold on.

01:05:30.561 --> 01:05:31.829
Let me grab a pen, because
I need your autograph.

01:05:31.862 --> 01:05:33.264
Okay, I'm a very
important person but that

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:34.831
is a bit much.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.599
I'm proud of you.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.634
Aw.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.171
And you look
absolutely amazing.

01:05:39.204 --> 01:05:40.539
Thank you.

01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:42.339
I'm a big girl, you know.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:43.541
I always bounce back.

01:05:43.575 --> 01:05:45.176
Hey, that's my girl!

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:48.245
Thank you very much.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:55.487
Lisa -- Lisa!

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.889
Michael is here
-- with a woman!

01:05:57.922 --> 01:05:59.324
I know.
I see him.

01:05:59.357 --> 01:06:00.525
Just stay calm, okay?

01:06:00.558 --> 01:06:01.526
I'm trying.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.528
Do you want to
get out of here?

01:06:02.562 --> 01:06:03.530
Yes.

01:06:03.562 --> 01:06:04.698
Where-where is the waiter?

01:06:04.731 --> 01:06:05.866
I will get him.
Just -- are you okay?

01:06:05.899 --> 01:06:08.368
No, hurry please.

01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:14.341
[INDISCERNIBLE], yeah?

01:06:14.374 --> 01:06:16.543
Oh boy this is
[INDISCERNIBLE].

01:06:16.576 --> 01:06:18.645
We went to
France two years ago.

01:06:18.679 --> 01:06:20.182
It was -- we went to
the [INDISCERNIBLE].

01:06:23.384 --> 01:06:25.485
What the -- Lisa,
what are you doing?

01:06:25.518 --> 01:06:26.521
You know what?

01:06:26.555 --> 01:06:27.590
Just go back to your
little whack-ass date and

01:06:27.622 --> 01:06:28.856
leave Lisa alone, okay?

01:06:28.889 --> 01:06:30.291
She's tired of
your bullshit!

01:06:30.325 --> 01:06:31.293
That's right, I don't
need to be bothered with

01:06:31.325 --> 01:06:32.528
no more tired men!

01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:33.528
Tired man, what
are you talking about?

01:06:33.561 --> 01:06:34.762
I treated you
like a queen.

01:06:34.796 --> 01:06:36.298
Yeah, after you tried
to get into her pants.

01:06:36.331 --> 01:06:37.399
You know what?

01:06:37.432 --> 01:06:38.066
Congratulations,
mission accomplished.

01:06:38.099 --> 01:06:39.368
Boy bye!
Boy bye, you bye!

01:06:39.402 --> 01:06:41.304
Exactly what she said.

01:06:41.337 --> 01:06:42.772
No, they slide you
and go with Rhianna.

01:06:42.805 --> 01:06:43.573
You know, what I
thought what we had was

01:06:43.605 --> 01:06:45.241
serious but I
guess I was wrong.

01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:47.276
I hope one day
you feel the

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:48.612
same way I feel
 right now.

01:06:48.645 --> 01:06:49.846
I hope you know what it
is to be manipulated into

01:06:49.879 --> 01:06:51.414
falling in love and
being -- What are --?

01:06:51.447 --> 01:06:52.749
-- and then being
thrown out like the trash!

01:06:52.782 --> 01:06:54.284
-- you talking about?

01:06:54.318 --> 01:06:56.387
You threw me away
like the trash!

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:57.387
Lisa, come on.
Let's go --

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.421
And why is
 she talking?

01:06:58.454 --> 01:06:59.422
No, no, no.
I want to hear this.

01:06:59.456 --> 01:07:00.791
Please tell me how
I threw you out, Michael.

01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:01.892
Don't touch me.

01:07:01.925 --> 01:07:06.965
I was head over
heels...correction

01:07:06.997 --> 01:07:09.967
I am head over
heels in love with you.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.035
I'm in love
with Lisa Bryant!

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.772
Yeah, you were everything
I needed and more --

01:07:13.805 --> 01:07:15.541
So how are we here?
Why are we here?

01:07:15.574 --> 01:07:16.407
Because this is
what you wanted!

01:07:16.442 --> 01:07:17.577
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.412
Huh?
You did this, not me!

01:07:19.445 --> 01:07:21.547
Lisa, let's just go!
Come on, let's just go.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.482
You called Frank and
asked him to shut it down,

01:07:23.516 --> 01:07:24.483
said it was
getting to serious.

01:07:24.516 --> 01:07:25.550
Who is Frank?

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:26.586
Right?
Right or wrong?

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.355
Who is Frank?
Oh, who is Frank?

01:07:28.388 --> 01:07:31.292
Frank Brinkley!
MyMr.Right.com, huh?

01:07:31.325 --> 01:07:32.559
Ringing any bells?

01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:34.060
What is he
talking about?

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:35.162
You play with -- I'll
tell you talking about.

01:07:35.194 --> 01:07:37.731
You go online, pull out
the little black card, huh?

01:07:37.763 --> 01:07:38.565
Yeah, got the
black card, huh?

01:07:38.599 --> 01:07:40.435
And then you
went bop, bop, bop, bop.

01:07:40.467 --> 01:07:41.402
Book your man, huh?

01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:42.737
Great time!
Great time!

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:43.737
But when you're over it,
you throw him to the curb

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:44.738
like the trash.

01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:45.739
Well guess what?

01:07:45.773 --> 01:07:47.309
I'm out!

01:07:47.342 --> 01:07:48.343
Wait a
minute, black card?

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:49.276
I'm done.

01:07:49.311 --> 01:07:52.882
Wait, wait -- you
work for MyMr.Right.com?

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:57.786
Norma?

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.691
I didn't
complete a profile.

01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:06.329
Oh my God.

01:08:08.498 --> 01:08:11.001
What is she
talking about, Norma?

01:08:11.034 --> 01:08:13.304
Huh?

01:08:14.472 --> 01:08:15.707
Norma!

01:08:17.441 --> 01:08:20.411
Lisa, I just wanted to
give you one night with a

01:08:20.443 --> 01:08:21.678
man of your dreams.

01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:23.348
It was not supposed
to go this far.

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.349
 So you go on a site
for an escort service?

01:08:25.383 --> 01:08:26.452
It's not an
escort service.

01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:27.452
And you complete
a profile without my

01:08:27.486 --> 01:08:28.487
knowledge.

01:08:28.519 --> 01:08:29.353
Lisa, I'm sorry.

01:08:29.388 --> 01:08:30.889
But it wasn't
supposed to be this way.

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:32.523
You were
supposed to be my sister!

01:08:32.555 --> 01:08:34.492
Lisa, Lisa.
Lisa.

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:36.127
Lisa.

01:08:36.161 --> 01:08:37.662
I don't know what
that was back there,

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:38.832
and I don't care.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:40.499
I don't care!

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.469
Okay?

01:08:42.502 --> 01:08:45.971
Here I am, right
here, right now.

01:08:46.005 --> 01:08:47.439
We were both lied to.

01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:48.841
I get it.
I get it.

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:52.546
Let's start over, hm?

01:08:52.578 --> 01:08:53.546
Let's start
over right now.

01:08:53.578 --> 01:08:55.881
Okay, I'm Michael Martin.

01:08:55.915 --> 01:08:58.651
I'm an artist.

01:08:58.685 --> 01:09:01.988
Let's go get
some ice cream.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:06.361
I hate ice cream.

01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:36.960
 The hell you
doing here?

01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:38.897
How'd you get my address?

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:43.600
Frank -- look, as
hard as it is for me to be

01:09:43.633 --> 01:09:45.636
here, it's not
even about me.

01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:49.908
It's not about you.
It's about Lisa.

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:57.081
So, can I come in or are
we just going to stand here?

01:09:57.115 --> 01:10:00.119
Come on.

01:10:00.151 --> 01:10:03.890
Thank you.

01:10:06.759 --> 01:10:08.995
Oh, so you really
do paint, huh?

01:10:09.027 --> 01:10:10.896
I really do paint.

01:10:10.929 --> 01:10:13.599
What's up?
Why are you here?

01:10:13.633 --> 01:10:15.169
Do you really feel
the way you said at the

01:10:15.202 --> 01:10:16.170
restaurant?

01:10:16.202 --> 01:10:17.303
You've gotta
be kidding me.

01:10:17.337 --> 01:10:18.672
You came all the way down
here to ask me a question?

01:10:18.706 --> 01:10:20.842
Don't play with me.

01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:24.645
Do you love Lisa
like you said you do?

01:10:25.845 --> 01:10:31.085
I love her like
the real kind, Norma.

01:10:31.118 --> 01:10:33.255
You happy?

01:10:33.288 --> 01:10:34.623
I believe you.

01:10:34.655 --> 01:10:36.123
I guess all is
right with the world.

01:10:36.157 --> 01:10:38.861
So now what?
Huh?

01:10:38.895 --> 01:10:40.497
I may have a plan.

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.798
Wanna share it?

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:43.632
I don't have one now.

01:10:43.665 --> 01:10:44.766
So you're just
saying you got

01:10:44.799 --> 01:10:45.834
a plan to come up
with a plan?

01:10:45.868 --> 01:10:47.870
That does me no good.

01:10:48.671 --> 01:10:49.939
I miss her.

01:10:49.972 --> 01:10:52.276
Makes two of us.

01:10:52.308 --> 01:10:54.844
You know what?

01:10:54.878 --> 01:10:57.648
Has she seen these?

01:10:57.681 --> 01:10:58.883
Mm-mm.

01:11:02.886 --> 01:11:07.692
Okay
Norma, I see you.

01:11:07.724 --> 01:11:10.629
I see you.

01:13:10.457 --> 01:13:12.693
 Hey Honey, it's me again.

01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:15.431
Look, I know
you're still mad at me, but

01:13:15.463 --> 01:13:17.667
I have to give
this one last shot.

01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:19.968
If you say no this time,
I promise I won't ever

01:13:20.002 --> 01:13:21.803
bother you again.
But,

01:13:21.837 --> 01:13:24.774
will you meet me at the
Shroud Gallery tomorrow?

01:13:24.806 --> 01:13:26.810
There's a new exhibit
there and

01:13:26.843 --> 01:13:28.211
I know you'll love it.

01:13:28.244 --> 01:13:29.946
It'll be like old times.

01:13:29.978 --> 01:13:33.949
Let's say
tomorrow around 2:00?

01:13:33.982 --> 01:13:37.154
If you don't come, then

01:13:37.187 --> 01:13:39.223
I know where
our friendship stands.

01:13:39.255 --> 01:13:42.826
Well, I pray I
see you there.

01:13:42.859 --> 01:13:47.432
All right, love you, Sis.
Bye.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.789
Mrs. Hernandez?
They're ready for you now.

01:14:10.823 --> 01:14:13.694
Okay, one second.
Okay, thanks so much.

01:14:31.478 --> 01:14:34.816
So without further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:34.848 --> 01:14:37.818
I am honored to
present to you the artist,

01:14:37.852 --> 01:14:39.889
Mr. Samuel Michael Martin.

01:14:39.921 --> 01:14:41.424
My golden boy!

01:14:41.456 --> 01:14:42.457
You did
good, you did good.

01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:43.859
Yeah?

01:14:43.893 --> 01:14:45.228
Get out --
get out of here.

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.830
Wow, I'm not um -- I'm
not really good at these

01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:50.900
moments, but I-I just
want to first thank Norma.

01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:53.302
Thank you guys for coming.

01:14:53.336 --> 01:14:55.773
Um, there's a lot of faces
that I see out here

01:14:55.805 --> 01:14:59.308
right now that directly
had a hand in

01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:02.079
every stroke of the work
that's up here right now.

01:15:02.113 --> 01:15:07.318
Um, the work you see on
display right now is um --

01:15:07.351 --> 01:15:09.287
it was inspired
by uh --

01:15:15.893 --> 01:15:23.869
by um, a special woman who
um I couldn't figure out

01:15:23.901 --> 01:15:25.337
how to tell her how
I really felt.

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:28.575
So I -- I just put
it on the canvas.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:32.512
A wise man
once said to me,

01:15:32.545 --> 01:15:37.450
"You can't paint what you
don't know."

01:15:37.482 --> 01:15:41.354
 I know her.

01:15:41.388 --> 01:15:43.524
Go.
Go get her! Go!

01:15:43.556 --> 01:15:45.827
You sure?
Yes! Go, run!

01:15:45.859 --> 01:15:47.828
It's not --
Get out of here!

01:15:47.862 --> 01:15:49.899
Go get it.
Go ahead, man.

01:15:51.999 --> 01:15:53.968
Lisa Bryant,

01:15:54.002 --> 01:15:56.806
keep running! I'm
gonna keep chasing you.

01:16:02.011 --> 01:16:05.448
You inspired all of that.

01:16:05.481 --> 01:16:10.486
Every color, every stroke.

01:16:10.518 --> 01:16:14.057
Lisa, time we shared
together changed my life.

01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:17.894
Every stroke, every kiss,
every touch --

01:16:17.928 --> 01:16:22.366
it's all in
those paintings.

01:16:22.398 --> 01:16:25.035
I never lied to you.

01:16:25.067 --> 01:16:26.370
I've loved you since
the first day we met

01:16:26.403 --> 01:16:28.873
and I love you
even more now.

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:35.580
Look, I know we
met in the most

01:16:35.612 --> 01:16:38.650
unusual circumstances,
right?

01:16:38.684 --> 01:16:42.922
But isn't there a chance
-- just a small chance --

01:16:42.954 --> 01:16:44.422
that we might've been
blessed with some random

01:16:44.456 --> 01:16:48.194
act of serendipity?

01:16:48.226 --> 01:16:49.194
I'm here.

01:16:49.228 --> 01:16:53.033
I'm right here, right now.

01:16:53.065 --> 01:16:55.067
Give me a chance.

01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:56.069
Give me a
chance to show you.

01:16:56.101 --> 01:17:00.039
Give me a
chance to show up!

01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:04.545
I'm your guy.

01:17:05.111 --> 01:17:09.617
I'm your guy.

01:17:12.085 --> 01:17:17.893
Don't say nothing.

01:17:23.098 --> 01:17:26.469
That was a good kiss.

01:17:26.501 --> 01:17:28.304
What?

01:17:28.337 --> 01:17:29.572
Two scoops?

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:30.973
Two scoops of what?

01:17:31.006 --> 01:17:32.408
Ice cream.

01:17:32.442 --> 01:17:34.144
Aah!

01:17:34.176 --> 01:17:36.045
If you're lactose
intolerant now,

01:17:36.078 --> 01:17:37.046
don't be
farting in my face.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.048
That's not me.

01:17:38.082 --> 01:17:39.050
Let's get
some ice cream.

01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:40.084
Yeah, let's get some.

01:17:40.118 --> 01:17:41.118
I'm going to get you
one scoop and I'm going to

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:42.118
be mad when I get it.

01:17:42.151 --> 01:17:43.052
Why?
Cause.

01:17:43.087 --> 01:17:44.321
Because this is a
complete waste of time.

01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:45.723
Give me that damn cone!

01:17:45.756 --> 01:17:47.091
Now!

01:17:47.123 --> 01:17:47.891
Now!

01:17:47.925 --> 01:17:49.127
I
want the cone now!

01:17:50.695 --> 01:17:53.098
Today my blog is
about living

01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:54.732
 in my own romance novel.

01:17:54.766 --> 01:17:58.003
Ladies, I'm here to tell
you that Mr. Right does

01:17:58.035 --> 01:17:59.270
exist.

01:17:59.303 --> 01:18:02.441
I found mine and if you
open your heart to new

01:18:02.474 --> 01:18:05.178
possibilities, you
might just find yours,

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:09.481
too.
