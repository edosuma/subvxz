02:16.160 --> 02:17.878
So I said,
"If opposing counsel's

02:17.960 --> 02:20.269
"invoking fiduciary
liability precedent

02:20.360 --> 02:22.157
"under the terms of
Landgraf v. Henson,

02:22.240 --> 02:25.152
"Your Honor, please,
by all means, go ahead,

02:25.240 --> 02:28.596
rescind the plaintiff's de facto
petition for injunctive relief."

02:30.240 --> 02:31.719
- It was fun. It was fun.
- Yeah.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.472
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'll be right back.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.677
So funny. "Injunctive relief."
That tickled my funny bone.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.312
What's up, Nick?

02:40.400 --> 02:45.076
Fucking sucks dick
about Grandma, huh?

02:45.160 --> 02:46.229
Yeah.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.197
Old woman fucking
murdered like that.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.034
- Nick, she had cancer.
- That's what they want you to think.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.076
She had cancer for ten years.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.277
A little too convenient, Jason.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.920
No, it's not... at all.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.433
We'll never know the truth.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.397
- We absolutely know the truth.
- Yeah.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.277
Grandma had cancer
for 10 years.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.396
You don't just die from cancer,
Jason!

03:07.480 --> 03:09.948
It's a conspiracy, man.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.110
Just like 9/11.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.990
Oh, God. For your information,
Grandma is not right here.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.799
Grandma is gone
and she was taken from us,

03:19.880 --> 03:22.553
- we must find the man that did this!
- Nick! Stop it!

03:22.680 --> 03:26.753
Ow, man! These are Rockports!
Fuck, man! I just got these.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.798
- Calm down...
- See you at the crossroads, Grandma.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.952
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me? Right now?

03:33.040 --> 03:34.758
Hey, get your shit together!

03:34.840 --> 03:37.877
My dad and my fiancée are literally
standing right next to us.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.279
- Beyoncé's here?
- No.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.351
Your dad and fiancée
are standing next to Beyoncé?

03:41.440 --> 03:43.351
- What? No.
- Is Jay Z here too?

03:43.440 --> 03:44.589
- No.
- Is Blue lvy here?

03:44.680 --> 03:46.113
- Nick.
- I'm in the minority.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.634
I think that kid's gonna be hot.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.551
What is that?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.073
Hmm?

03:52.160 --> 03:53.388
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

03:53.480 --> 03:55.914
- Are you fucking high right now?
- No, this isn't...

03:56.000 --> 03:57.399
- You're high as a kite!
- It's an e-cigarette.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.313
It's filled with a little weed,
but it's an e-cigarette.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.152
Grow up, man!
What are you doing?

04:02.240 --> 04:04.549
"Grow up"?
How adult are you?

04:04.680 --> 04:06.636
What, do you listen
to NPR in your Volvo?

04:06.720 --> 04:09.473
You play racquetball competitively
against business associates?

04:09.600 --> 04:12.034
- No. No.
- You ever go away to a rented house

04:12.120 --> 04:13.792
with other couples
and then play Scattergories

04:13.880 --> 04:16.713
- over a bottle of white wine?
- Jason.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.517
Uh...

04:21.880 --> 04:23.677
I just blew a shot at
your grandma's memory.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.797
Nick, get it together right now.
Lock it up.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.351
I'm not hugging you.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.395
If I hug you, will you stop
messing around?

04:45.240 --> 04:47.037
Cropdusted, motherfucker!

04:47.120 --> 04:48.872
- You just got cropdusted!
- Hey!

04:48.960 --> 04:50.712
- You're high now!
- Get the fuck away from me!

04:50.800 --> 04:52.199
Now we're both high
at Grandma's funeral!

04:52.280 --> 04:55.875
We're bonded for life.
Uncle Dan, sorry, man. Tough day!

05:21.440 --> 05:22.873
Poor Grandpa...

05:44.080 --> 05:47.914
Our first reading
is from Deuteronomy 30:19.

05:49.560 --> 05:53.314
"This day I call
the heavens and the earth

05:53.400 --> 05:55.311
as a witness against you..."

05:56.520 --> 05:58.158
"...that I have set before you
life and death..."

05:58.240 --> 06:00.310
Hey, babe, I found the tie
you're going to wear

06:00.400 --> 06:03.198
to the rehearsal brunch Sunday.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.113
Do you like the coral
color or the salmon?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.997
"...that the race
is not to the swift..."

06:08.080 --> 06:09.479
Either one.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.240
"...nor the battle to the strong."

06:12.640 --> 06:15.154
Babe, what's wrong?

06:15.240 --> 06:16.992
Coral or salmon?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.430
- Well, what do you like?
- I mean... I like the coral.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.592
That's what
I was going to say, too.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.272
- Okay, cool. Okay.
- Okay.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.358
Coral it is!

06:29.560 --> 06:31.152
It's going to be a special day.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.754
"...now choose life,

06:33.840 --> 06:36.877
so that you
and your children shall live."

06:40.480 --> 06:42.311
Anyway, I'm down
in Valdosta right now.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.992
I opened up
a fucking pet shop...

06:44.080 --> 06:47.152
- Not pet shop, "puppy mill."
- Puppy mill...

06:47.240 --> 06:49.549
You know, designer dogs
get a bad name,

06:49.640 --> 06:51.471
but they can go
for quite a pretty penny.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.400
- Really?
- It's just hard to get them to mate.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.715
- Oh.
- Because the little dogs,

06:55.800 --> 06:57.279
they don't wanna
fuck the big dogs,

06:57.360 --> 06:59.641
and the big dogs, they don't wanna
fuck the little dogs...

06:59.720 --> 07:02.280
So I gotta manually
do it, you know.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.960
I gotta spread
and manually shoot in.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.076
- Uh-huh.
- So, what's up with you?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.071
- Well, I'm keeping pretty busy...
- Cool.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.357
- Hey, Diane, how's it going?
- Hi, Nick.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.192
- Hey, Nick.
- I just don't understand why you have

07:14.280 --> 07:16.794
to drive down to Florida
tomorrow already, Dad!

07:16.880 --> 07:17.949
We just had the funeral.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.469
Your grandmother and I were there
at this time every year.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.840
It's what she would have wanted.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.674
I'd drive down myself,
except they took my license away.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.955
But why does Jason have
to be the one to drive you?

07:28.040 --> 07:29.519
He's so busy at work...

07:29.600 --> 07:31.716
Got the wedding coming up next weekend,
the rehearsal brunch.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.917
You know, the entire law
firm is coming to this.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.240
- It's true, Grandpa.
- Jason...

07:36.320 --> 07:37.435
We have a lot of stuff,
Meredith and l...

07:37.560 --> 07:39.278
I'll handle it.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.759
Go ahead.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.274
How about Cousin Nick? Huh, Dad?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.391
Why doesn't Nick do it?

07:45.480 --> 07:49.075
We got this chocolate lab down at
the store that is just so horny,

07:49.160 --> 07:52.436
every time I touch the back of its ear,
it just gushes cum.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.239
- Uh, okay.
- I mean, like a squirting...

07:55.320 --> 07:56.435
Is that your dog?

07:56.520 --> 07:59.796
Nick isn't legally allowed
to leave the state of Georgia anymore.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.348
I've barely seen this guy
since high school.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.112
What's wrong with spending
some time with him?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.192
Oh, so spending time with family
is suddenly important to you now?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.874
Look, he can come here
tomorrow morning for breakfast.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.560
We can drive down
to Boca during the day,

08:11.640 --> 08:13.551
maybe play a round of golf or two,

08:13.680 --> 08:15.750
then he'd be back here
in Atlanta the next day.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.195
He can't just
flake off for two days!

08:18.280 --> 08:21.750
The risk versus reward here is just...
I don't see it happening.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.799
It's what she would
have wanted, that's all.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.510
But if you have to get ready for your
wedding, if you're that busy...

08:38.840 --> 08:41.115
I just don't understand
why he wants you to take him.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.519
You're not even that close.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.397
Well, we used to be.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.152
Grandpa and I got along growing up.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.915
We used to build these model trains
every Christmas, so I brought him...

08:50.000 --> 08:52.195
Well, it seems like we're cutting it
a little close here, you know,

08:52.280 --> 08:55.955
- with the rehearsal brunch on Friday...
- I know. I know.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.350
And by the way, I can't find any of the
Martha's Vineyard vacation photos

08:59.440 --> 09:02.113
for the slide show.
I'm just freaking out.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.714
That's because they're on my laptop,
which I've got right here.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.153
So I'll send them
to the wedding planner.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.468
You don't have to worry about anything.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.792
Thanks. And your dad says take 75,
because 16 takes forever.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.760
Yeah, I know. He's got
it all mapped out for me.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.836
And can you take my car, sweetie?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.229
Uh, I need the SUV for the wine.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.199
Grandpa?

09:38.840 --> 09:40.353
Grandpa?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.318
Grandpa?

10:15.320 --> 10:17.151
Hey! You made it!

10:17.240 --> 10:19.310
Give me a minute...

10:19.400 --> 10:21.516
Oh, God! Shit!

10:21.640 --> 10:23.870
Grab my ass!

10:25.960 --> 10:28.554
- You ready to hit the road?
- I'm really sorry, Grandpa.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.393
I didn't think you'd be doing that.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.436
Ah, so you caught me
taking a number three.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.351
- Big deal, right?
- Number three?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.829
Have a drink.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.912
Uh... No. I'm driving, so...

10:41.000 --> 10:47.075
I just got to finish up my exercises,
and then we'll hop on 16 to 95.

10:47.800 --> 10:51.509
Dad says we should take 75 to 95.
It's more direct.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.158
Dad's full of shit.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.800
Grandpa, are you sure you're okay?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.239
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.278
Those fuckheads down at the DMV
took my goddamn license away

11:02.360 --> 11:03.759
because of these fucking
cataracts in my eye.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.559
But I can still hit the shit
out of a golf ball, that's for sure!

11:06.640 --> 11:09.837
I made a tee time for us in Florida
for this afternoon.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.036
You can use your
grandmother's lady clubs,

11:12.120 --> 11:13.473
they're right there
by the front door.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.028
Okay.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.712
All right, you ready?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.438
I thought the plan was
to have breakfast here?

11:19.520 --> 11:22.592
That's your breakfast. Now let's go get
in that giant labia you drove up in

11:22.680 --> 11:24.750
and get the fuck out of here.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.953
You sure I should be
driving with this, Grandpa?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.837
Don't worry, if you spill it,

11:40.920 --> 11:43.000
this giant tampon we're driving
in should soak it up.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.990
Just finishing a work email

11:54.080 --> 11:57.993
for the Steinhart file...

11:59.160 --> 12:01.754
So you're a lawyer at your dad's
firm now, is that right?

12:01.840 --> 12:04.195
That's right, and Meredith is too.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.475
You know, her dad is one of
the managing partners there, so...

12:06.560 --> 12:08.755
- I know, that's...
- Yeah.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.274
It couldn't have worked out better.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.510
Because it's just that I remember
when you were in high school,

12:13.600 --> 12:16.194
you told me how much you wanted to be
a photographer, travel the world.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.395
That sort of thing.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.631
You remember when I got you that
subscription to Time magazine?

12:20.760 --> 12:24.799
Yeah, I used to be
into photography, but, um...

12:24.880 --> 12:26.950
I mean, with Dad
being at the firm, pfft,

12:27.040 --> 12:30.237
it just made so much more sense
to focus on a college curriculum

12:30.320 --> 12:31.720
that stressed the law school track.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.392
I mean, I love what I do, Grandpa.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.671
Being a corporate lawyer is awesome,
I get to handle SEC compliance...

12:36.760 --> 12:39.115
- No shit!
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.509
You handle SEC compliance?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.672
- LP agreements.
- Oh, man, I didn't know that.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.557
- LLC agreements.
- You're shitting me!

12:46.640 --> 12:49.996
Being a corporate lawyer,
it's got its upsides.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.588
- You know what I'd rather do?
- What?

12:52.680 --> 12:55.353
I'd rather let Queen Latifah
shit in my mouth

12:55.440 --> 12:57.874
from a fucking hot air balloon.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.713
That's me. I'm gonna hit
the liquor store over there,

13:00.840 --> 13:03.513
get some more of the creature. Meet you
back at the Dildomobile in five.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.876
You're paying the check,
Alan Douche-owitz.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.951
Where do I know that guy from?
He looks so familiar.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.349
He looks like
Abercrombie fucked Fitch.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.550
Mmm, yeah, while J.Crew J'd-off.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.029
Shit! No, you guys, he was...
It's so funny.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.351
He was my lab partner
in photography class, freshman year.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.557
No shit!
He's a Florida alum?

13:25.640 --> 13:27.232
Lenore, you can totally
finish the trifecta.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.914
Oh, my God, I already
have alum, remember?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.560
I fucked that crying divorced guy, Tony.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.312
- With the big balls.
- Right. Yeah.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.549
- In the porta-potty.
- Yeah.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.914
- At the tailgate.
- Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I need a professor.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.116
Wait, I'm sorry.
What's the trifecta again?

13:40.200 --> 13:42.919
It's this thing I read about

13:43.000 --> 13:46.072
where in my senior year
I have to fuck a freshman,

13:46.160 --> 13:47.354
an alumni, and a professor.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.396
- Where did you read that?
- In my diary.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.118
Hmm.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.758
- Where I wrote it...
- Yeah.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.513
He used to take
the most beautiful portraits

13:55.600 --> 13:57.477
without using any filters
or Photoshop...

13:57.560 --> 14:00.438
- I've read your diary.
- He was amazing.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.555
Oh, my God, you did?

14:01.640 --> 14:02.755
- Yeah.
- Did you like it?

14:02.840 --> 14:05.434
You guys aren't listening.
I'm gonna go say hi to him. Okay?

14:05.520 --> 14:07.476
- Slut...
- Cool...

14:07.560 --> 14:10.836
I hope you don't get
Tommy Hilfingered.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.434
That was really late,
but it still counts.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.476
Just like all my periods...

14:15.560 --> 14:16.560
- Ew.
- What?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.834
Hi. How are you?

14:22.920 --> 14:25.639
Good. Here you go,
you can keep the change.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.354
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not... You...

14:28.440 --> 14:32.433
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.749
Um...

14:36.840 --> 14:39.798
- Guys? Guys, listen to me.
- What?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.438
- Let's go.
- Bitch, what?

14:41.520 --> 14:43.192
- Shut the fuck up! Go!
- Oh, my God!

14:45.520 --> 14:48.034
You all set?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.634
Yeah, I just gave my money
to the other waitress, sorry.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.790
There is no other waitress.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.714
I'm the only one who's
ever worked here. Ever...

14:56.800 --> 14:59.314
Shit! The fucking piece
of shit car never starts!

14:59.400 --> 15:02.915
Hey!

15:03.000 --> 15:06.629
God, he's like a Mitt Romney Terminator.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.233
Excuse me!

15:08.320 --> 15:11.995
Uh, sorry, my shift is actually over,
so... Sorry...

15:12.080 --> 15:14.514
- Oh, no way.
- What?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.471
- I know you.
- No.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.397
Yeah, I do. You were
in my photography class.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.954
You took all those landscapes. Right?

15:21.040 --> 15:24.749
- Shadia.
- Yeah. Shadia.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.149
Holy shit, you're Shadia?

15:27.280 --> 15:28.872
- Yeah. Shadia.
- Shadia.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.315
- Jamba!
- What the fuck!

15:31.400 --> 15:33.994
Shadia. It means
"singer" in Arabic.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.430
Or in ancient Arabic,
"al-munshida alati tunadi lel-mei."

15:37.520 --> 15:40.159
Or, "she whose name
calls others to water."

15:40.240 --> 15:42.549
- That's actually right.
- Uh, Shadia, this is my...

15:42.640 --> 15:45.154
Dr. Richards. I teach history
at the University of Georgia.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.037
You're a professor?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.270
Yeah. Why? You looking
for some extra credit?

15:50.400 --> 15:52.470
Jason and I are doing
a story on the Middle East.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.471
He's a photographer
for Time magazine.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.553
You know, I lost my virginity
at my pop-pop's bingo night.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.709
My name's Lenore.

15:59.800 --> 16:04.794
Ah! "The rare and radiant maiden
whom the angels named Lenore"

16:04.880 --> 16:06.472
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'"

16:07.480 --> 16:12.395
- Diplomaticos, huh?
- Hey, you know your cigars.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.960
What are you,
half Cuban or something?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.792
Actually, I am, professor.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.992
- The bottom half.
- Okay.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.069
Okay, yeah, we're heading out.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.229
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.389
We're going
to Daytona Beach for the week.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.914
Oh, my God, and we should have been
there three fucking hours ago...

16:27.000 --> 16:28.991
...so let's go, bitches!

16:29.080 --> 16:30.991
- Holy shit.
- What?

16:31.080 --> 16:33.548
Nothing. You're just really gay.

16:33.640 --> 16:37.155
Oh, am I?
Thanks, Captain Gaydar.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.595
Jesus! You know,
I'm also black, right?

16:39.680 --> 16:41.591
Yeah, I know. That's funny too.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.035
So you guys wanna tag
along for a bit maybe?

16:44.120 --> 16:46.793
Party some babies into us?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.074
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely not!

16:48.160 --> 16:51.152
- Why?
- We have a very important tee time.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.349
Of course you do.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.192
And do you also have to take a nap
before you play Mahjong?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.918
- No, it's shuffleboard.
- Shuffleboard.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.955
And then early dinner at 4:00.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.315
We have a long-standing bet.
Who's the better golfer.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.436
Obviously I've got the bigger 3-wood...

17:01.520 --> 17:04.557
Good. Maybe you can use it
to hit your balls right into my vagina.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.436
- Holy shit!
- Okay, we're going inside now.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.112
- Jesus!
- Let's go. That's enough.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.714
- Bye, professor.
- Thanks for lunch.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.034
Peace!

17:13.839 --> 17:15.671
- Nice girl.
- Yeah.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.910
Well? How do I look?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.309
Like the keynote speaker
at a butt-fucking convention.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.392
- What?
- What?

17:37.480 --> 17:40.438
We're gonna write in the first hole,
it's an easy par-4.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.715
- No, no, no, no. Hey...
- Jump in.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.234
- This is against the rules, Grandpa.
- Fuck the rules. Jump in. Come on.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.471
Not to mention,
a breach in golf etiquette.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.312
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

17:50.400 --> 17:51.833
- Whoa! Hey!
- Out of my way, butt-fuckers!

17:51.920 --> 17:53.319
Really? What are you doing?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.197
We gotta get this guy
to his butt-fucking convention.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.555
What are you trying to do, man?
What was that all about?

17:57.680 --> 18:00.433
Hey. Now there's
a million-dollar swing!

18:00.520 --> 18:02.192
I'm sorry! Um...

18:02.280 --> 18:06.398
You can go in front of us
if you want to. We are not very good.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.592
No, it's a good cut, you're just
not bending your knees enough.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.560
I'm a licensed golf pro.
You mind if I show you?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.835
Yes, please.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.593
Maybe bend over
a little bit... Here.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.511
That feels about right,
doesn't it?

18:18.600 --> 18:21.637
Hands on my shaft...
The shaft.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.790
Let me just get
my finger in there.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.350
One, two, three... Oh!

18:27.440 --> 18:30.796
Oh, my God!
Did you see that? Thank you!

18:30.920 --> 18:32.512
How long have you
been teaching golf?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.830
Ever since I retired
from being an astronaut.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.833
It's nice to see some
heavenly bodies around here too.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.356
Hey, Grandpa, don't you think we should
probably start golfing soon...

18:42.440 --> 18:44.715
- What the fuck?
- Wanna be a lamb and get that for me?

18:44.800 --> 18:47.712
- Did he just call you "Grandpa"?
- Who, Pepe?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.030
He's a retard.
Got it pretty bad, too.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.031
He thinks I'm his grandpa.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.714
He usually sits at home
just drawing dolphins all day.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.472
We used to let him
out on his own,

18:56.560 --> 18:59.677
but the raping got so bad
that we just...

19:01.800 --> 19:03.518
Got it.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.880
- You guys want a refill?
- Sure.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.639
- Absolutely!
- BRB!

19:07.720 --> 19:10.473
I'm sorry about my grandpa.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.551
He's, um...
He's not doing too well.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.393
My grandma just passed
and the funeral was yesterday.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.357
Oh...

19:17.440 --> 19:20.398
I'm actually a lawyer, not a retard.

19:20.480 --> 19:25.156
I handle of lot of important issues.
SEC compliance,

19:25.240 --> 19:30.075
LLC agreements. LP agreements.
That sort of stuff.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.470
Yeah, um, well,
I think we're gonna get going.

19:33.560 --> 19:36.916
- Nice to meet you, Pepe.
- Nice...

19:38.920 --> 19:41.559
Fuck!

19:41.640 --> 19:43.471
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What happened?

19:43.560 --> 19:45.437
Why are they going?
What did you do?

19:45.520 --> 19:46.640
What? I told them the truth.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.352
I told them that I'm getting
married next week,

19:48.440 --> 19:51.193
and you're not well
because your wife just died.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.191
What are you,
fucking vagina repellent?

19:53.280 --> 19:54.395
Those cougars wanted to party!

19:54.480 --> 19:55.913
- They wanted to party?
- Yes!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.115
Do you hear yourself?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.952
Grandpa, are you kidding
me right now? Grandma...

19:59.040 --> 20:00.075
I'm trying to listen to myself.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.118
Grandma's funeral was yesterday!
Now you wanna hit on college girls?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.794
You're jerking off to porn?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.348
- What's wrong with you?
- Jason, I want to fuck!

20:08.440 --> 20:09.714
Oh, my God...

20:09.800 --> 20:12.792
For the first time in 40 years
I'm single and I want to fuck.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.995
I want to fuck

20:14.080 --> 20:15.479
until my dick falls off.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.711
I want to fuck a horse
and I wanna drink its blood!

20:18.800 --> 20:19.800
I'm gonna throw up.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.589
I was faithful to your grandmother
every day for 40 years,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.989
even through the menopause,
even through the cancer.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.237
She was the love of my life.
I'll miss her every goddamn day.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.472
But she told me on her deathbed,
"You get back out there again."

20:33.560 --> 20:35.994
I haven't had sex in 15 years, Jason,

20:36.080 --> 20:37.991
and I want to fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

20:38.080 --> 20:39.274
Oh, so that's what this is all about?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.669
This whole thing.
You didn't want to be with me.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.153
You wanted me
to drive you down to Boca

20:43.240 --> 20:44.468
so I could be your fucking wingman?

20:44.560 --> 20:45.629
Well, obviously
I made a bad decision

20:45.720 --> 20:47.358
because you're nothing but
a cock-blocking machine.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.079
I don't know what you are. You're like
the lsraeli Iron Dome defense system,

20:50.160 --> 20:51.752
but with vaginas
instead of missiles.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.160
- What?
- You're like some sort of

20:53.200 --> 20:56.317
cock-blocking Terminator sent back from
the future to cock-block humans.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.759
- Oh!
- The robots should have sent you

20:57.840 --> 20:59.160
instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

20:59.240 --> 21:01.515
you could have cock-blocked
John Connor's parents

21:01.600 --> 21:03.670
- and he would never have been born!
- Shut up, Grandpa!

21:03.760 --> 21:05.079
- Shut up!
- What got into you?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.269
I remember you in high school,

21:06.360 --> 21:08.351
you were ripping people's dicks off
on the football field,

21:08.440 --> 21:10.078
talking about traveling the world!

21:10.160 --> 21:12.230
Now you're pushing some papers
at a fucking law firm

21:12.320 --> 21:13.799
and probably peeing sitting down.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.598
Grandpa, I don't know what you thought
this weekend was going to be about,

21:15.680 --> 21:20.674
but I came here for one reason,
to get you to Boca. That's it.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.870
- Fine.
- Now can I please play some golf?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.313
- Fucking golf.
- Okay.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.958
Cocky McBlockerson.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.672
What the fuck?

21:36.760 --> 21:38.079
Bam!

21:39.200 --> 21:41.316
Who does your taxes?
H&R Cock-block?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.233
Stop it.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.438
Bam!

21:50.520 --> 21:52.590
Are you still Jenny
from the cock-block?

21:52.680 --> 21:55.148
What the fuck!
What is your obsession with my ass?

21:55.240 --> 21:57.993
Your vibrator's on.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.391
You can't get into it anyway
because you don't know my code.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.358
Looks like your grandpa
remembered your birthday!

22:04.440 --> 22:06.715
- What? Give me that!
- We're going to fucking Daytona.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.995
We're not going to Daytona,

22:10.080 --> 22:13.152
because I've got
the keys to the golf cart.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.235
What are you doing?

22:18.320 --> 22:19.548
Hey.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.598
- How'd you do that?
- Coming or staying, Jack Dicklaus?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.557
- Grandpa?
- Hurry up, Bubba Twatson.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.596
- Grandpa, stop.
- Gary Player-with-my-balls.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.680
Stop the cart!

22:27.760 --> 22:29.280
Fred Couples-of-big-dicks-in-your-ass.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.591
- Oh, my God. Grandpa! Stop!
- Michelle Wies-all-over-my-face.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.920
Now, this is what
I'm fucking talking about.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.956
This is so fucked up.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.713
Calm down, you'll get to hang out
with that gypsy girl you like.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.791
- I don't like her.
- Oh, yes, you do.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.553
That's why you didn't deny being
a photographer for Time magazine.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.632
You can hang out with her,
I can have vaginal sex with Lenore.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.473
It all works out! We can even
go visit my old army buddy, Stinky.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.630
Stinky?

23:13.720 --> 23:15.711
Which tiki bar are they in?

23:15.800 --> 23:18.314
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.833
- What's that?
- It's Meredith.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.757
- Please, I've got to answer that.
- Ah, tell her to fuck off.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.875
Grandpa!

23:22.960 --> 23:25.428
I'm just gonna check the testosterone
levels on your phone first.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.839
Grandpa, give me my phone now!

23:26.920 --> 23:28.478
Just as I thought. Pretty low.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.471
This is Meredith calling... Shit!

23:30.560 --> 23:33.120
Now, look what you did,
you dropped it in the car's vagina.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.031
God damn it,
I have to put it on speaker.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.588
- Don't say anything.
- I will not say a word.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.989
Ballbags!

23:40.080 --> 23:42.674
Hey! Who was that?

23:42.760 --> 23:44.478
No one.
We're in a restaurant. Sorry.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
"Who's that?"

23:45.640 --> 23:48.916
- What's up?
- Okay... Well, I really want them

23:49.000 --> 23:50.280
to post our wedding announcement

23:50.360 --> 23:53.432
on the New York Times website
before our rehearsal brunch Friday,

23:53.520 --> 23:55.317
so I just wanted to run
your section back to you.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.436
Yeah, you know,
now's really not a good time...

23:57.520 --> 24:00.273
Jason? Can we just do this please?

24:00.360 --> 24:02.669
"Can we do this now?"

24:02.760 --> 24:07.880
- "Jason Richard Kelly, son of..."
- Doctor Smegma Von BoxMunchers."

24:07.960 --> 24:12.875
"David and Brooke, is a junior associate
at the law firm of..."

24:12.960 --> 24:16.714
- "Cream pie fart and donkey punch!"
- Okay, who is that?

24:16.800 --> 24:20.190
It's no one. It's a waiter
with pretty bad Tourette's, I think...

24:21.640 --> 24:24.393
He just keeps walking by yelling
weird shit, I don't know why...

24:24.480 --> 24:27.074
Okay, well,
what restaurant are you at?

24:27.160 --> 24:29.390
- I can barely even hear you now.
- We're at Chuck E. Cheese's...

24:29.480 --> 24:32.517
Daytona fucking Beach!

24:32.600 --> 24:35.512
Daytona fucking Beach!
You're right, buddy!

24:35.600 --> 24:38.194
- You're in Daytona Beach?
- Uh...

24:38.280 --> 24:40.475
Listen, we're just driving
through Daytona Beach.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.437
- We're en route to Grandpa's...
- Jason!

24:42.520 --> 24:43.873
I don't know why you're there,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.719
but you'd better call me
from your grandfather's house

24:46.800 --> 24:49.234
- when you get there tonight, okay?
- Of course, baby.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.117
I love you so much...

24:51.200 --> 24:53.191
- Fuck!
- Marriage is hard.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.679
What'd the hot
college girls text back?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.751
Grandpa, what are you texting them?

24:56.840 --> 24:58.068
- I just texted them.
- What are you texting them?

24:58.160 --> 24:59.912
"We'll meet you on the beach."

25:00.000 --> 25:03.515
Yeah, and I added the emoji
with the wink and the tongue out.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.636
I'm not kidding, Grandpa.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.359
You realize that if I don't call her
from your house in Boca tonight,

25:08.440 --> 25:09.953
I'm fucked, man, I'm fucked.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.271
Jesus. Sounds like you're marrying
your fucking parole officer.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.828
It's just Meredith.
It's the way she is, man.

25:15.920 --> 25:20.198
She just gets, like, anxious when
she doesn't know exactly where I am.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.475
Don't panic.
It's organic.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.596
Yeah, I know. Couples get in
fights all the time.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.114
But it's different with Meredith.
She takes it to another level, man,

25:27.200 --> 25:29.589
and I'm telling you, if I don't call her
from your house in Boca, I'm screwed.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.910
Well, ain't nobody got time for that.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.355
Yeah, I know. Clearly.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.954
Which is why I don't understand
how we got so far off schedule.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.474
Oh... Sometimes
life is just a fart zone,

25:39.600 --> 25:41.272
and you enter at your own risk.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.033
Have you been reading shit off the shot
glasses and the shirts in here

25:46.120 --> 25:47.951
and just saying it like it's wisdom?

25:48.040 --> 25:49.632
I was seriously trying
to talk to you, man.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.233
Do you realize the stakes here?

25:51.360 --> 25:53.351
- You're ridiculous!
- Smile.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.000
You've had a phone
this entire fucking time?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.513
What else
don't I know about you?

25:57.600 --> 25:59.636
How the hell do you know
how to speak Arabic?

25:59.720 --> 26:01.472
Dad's never said
anything about that.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.630
That's because your dad
doesn't really know much about me.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.840
I was away with the army
during most of his childhood.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.112
- So we were never that close.
- Is that why he doesn't like you?

26:13.920 --> 26:15.399
Anybody work here?

26:15.480 --> 26:17.436
Okay, everybody on the fucking floor!

26:17.520 --> 26:22.435
This is a goddamn robbery!
On the fucking ground!

26:24.640 --> 26:27.518
Oh, my God,
you should see your faces!

26:27.600 --> 26:29.989
I just went out to grab lunch
and a new horse mask.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.878
I left mine at the beach
the other day. Whoo!

26:32.960 --> 26:35.713
I thought you were gonna
shit your pants, little guy.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.475
- Gun's real though.
- What the fuck, man!

26:39.560 --> 26:41.869
Relax, this is Florida.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.916
Everything's a licensed gun range.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.031
You just shot through a wall, man!

26:46.120 --> 26:47.553
- Hey...
- There's pedestrians outside!

26:47.640 --> 26:51.599
Yeah, again, it's Florida!
These people don't matter.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.229
- What?
- So? Welcome to Tam Pam Surf Slam.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.356
What can I do for you gentlemen?
I'm Pam.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.396
- You're Pam?
- Yeah. It's a nickname.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.118
Real name's Pamela.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.192
Hey, no, guys! Absolutely not!

27:06.280 --> 27:12.196
I will not ever sell you drugs
out of this establishment!

27:12.280 --> 27:13.759
We didn't ask you
to sell us drugs.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.553
Okay, cool. You're not cops.

27:15.640 --> 27:20.270
In which case, welcome to drugs!

27:20.360 --> 27:22.271
- Oh, my God.
- Now, I'm pretty cool,

27:22.360 --> 27:24.396
so I only sell the stuff
that occurs naturally.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.914
So I got weed,
I got mushrooms, I got meth.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.393
- Meth?
- Yeah.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.480
How is that natural?

27:29.520 --> 27:31.750
Well, it occurs naturally
in my cousin's basement in Baltimore,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.229
if you know what I mean.

27:34.320 --> 27:39.075
Okay, fine, drugs aren't your thing.
Got it. Message received.

27:39.160 --> 27:43.199
In which case, listen, we got a great
local charity here. Pam's Kids.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.794
- What's Pam's Kids?
- It's my kids.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.950
I got four kids by six different women.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.031
I know, the numbers don't add up.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.759
Most of 'em are pretty
developmentally disabled.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.035
One of 'em you gotta push around
in a weird chair.

27:55.120 --> 27:59.113
Heyo! Now that is the generosity
of the human spirit,

27:59.200 --> 28:01.998
and I appreciate that. Some of this
money's gonna feed my kids,

28:02.080 --> 28:04.355
some of it's gonna get me a blowjob
by a toothless whore

28:04.440 --> 28:06.192
behind a Dumpster
down at the McDonald's.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.799
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.074
Hi, professor.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.310
Well, there's the prettiest
little girl on the beach.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.709
- Thank you.
- I was actually talking to him.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.713
Yup! Immediately offensive.
I'm going back to the hotel.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.394
Just try not to join the cast
of Rent on the way back!

28:51.600 --> 28:54.637
So we got the professor,
you got the millionaire.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.950
How's the rest
of the Gilligan's Island cast?

28:57.040 --> 28:58.109
We're good.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.474
- Yeah?
- Yeah, everyone's good.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.400
- Well, that's good.
- Copacetic on the island.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.554
How are those washed-out
pictures you're taking

29:03.640 --> 29:05.153
because you still have
the lighting optimizer on?

29:05.240 --> 29:06.673
They're not... Where is that?

29:06.760 --> 29:11.311
Actually, it's really hypersensitive
on the new 60D model.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.515
So you have to...

29:12.600 --> 29:14.113
- Wait. What is that?
- Okay, nope.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.430
- What are you doing?
- Give it back, Malibu Ken.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.669
- No...
- What?

29:17.760 --> 29:19.955
You did it. You turned
into one of those people.

29:20.040 --> 29:23.476
I turned into one of those people
that gives a shit about something?

29:23.560 --> 29:24.913
Are you gonna chain
yourself to a polar bear?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.276
Only if you let me borrow...
What is this, a beach sweater?

29:28.360 --> 29:31.158
- Yeah.
- What, did you just come from skiing?

29:31.240 --> 29:34.835
Yeah, I skied in,
just to see you save the world.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.669
- One Jell-O shot at a time.
- High-five!

29:38.760 --> 29:40.591
You want me to do your back?

29:40.680 --> 29:42.671
Only if you promise
to do my front first.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.279
Gladly.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.193
Oh. Whoops!

29:47.280 --> 29:49.111
That never usually happens.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.031
Really? It happens to me all the time.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.714
Well, guess who
just took a shit in the water?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.597
We've been looking
for you bitches all day.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.036
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Uh, our car broke down in Orlando.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.678
Do you ever
look at your cell phone?

30:00.760 --> 30:03.320
Awesome.
Who are these cunt punches?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.312
These are our friends
that we met on the way down.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.233
- Yeah.
- That's Cody and Brah.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.311
They're on the
lacrosse team at Florida.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.868
- This guy plays lacrosse?
- All-conference, brah!

30:13.960 --> 30:16.076
Yeah? Which one, the fucking
Diabetes Conference?

30:18.320 --> 30:20.276
All right, we're about to boat
race a bunch of those fucks

30:20.360 --> 30:22.828
from the University of Georgia
up in the room. So...

30:22.920 --> 30:24.751
Oh, my God! University of Georgia!

30:24.840 --> 30:27.308
- No way! You're a Hornet?
- Afraid so.

30:27.400 --> 30:32.155
Well, you guys should get in there then,
Edward Jizzumhands.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.117
Well, thank you. We will.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.158
Good, that's great.
I'll see you up there.

30:37.240 --> 30:40.596
Oh, good. Well, you say
we'll be there and on time.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.353
- Sweet. I will.
- Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.714
- No, we should.
- Let's do it now.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.472
- Yeah, I'll see you up there.
- What...

30:46.560 --> 30:51.076
Come to the hotel. By the pool.
Georgia sucks!

30:51.200 --> 30:54.749
Can we please just go?
They've got boyfriends.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.070
Those meatdick fucks?
They're not their boyfriends.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.752
They're just seniors,

30:58.840 --> 31:00.796
and they're all just terrified
and speed-fucking each other

31:00.920 --> 31:03.115
before the ship goes down.
Didn't you ever go on Spring Break?

31:03.200 --> 31:06.431
No, I didn't go to Spring Break,
'cause I was studying for law school.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.988
Besides, I can't chug alcohol anymore
like I used to, Grandpa.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.116
I've developed, like, a gag reflex.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.713
- A gag reflex?
- Yeah.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.439
You're chugging a beer,
not taking down a horse cock, Jason.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.152
Come on.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.993
- Go Hornets!
- Go Hornets, yeah...

31:30.080 --> 31:32.071
Hey, you know, one in three
of these girls has herpes.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.633
Even if you can't see it.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.438
Oh, Jesus.
Nut the fuck up.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.875
It's just a college party, you nance.
Chill!

31:38.000 --> 31:40.036
Hey, here they are.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.157
I'm gonna get some beers.
What about you, twinkle toes?

31:43.240 --> 31:45.993
You want some of dat drank?
Some of dat purple drank?

31:46.080 --> 31:50.517
Some of dat purple-ass muthafuckin'
pimp-dick drank?

31:50.600 --> 31:54.229
Who the fuck are you?

31:57.400 --> 31:59.675
It's a pretty rockin' party.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.512
Whoo.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.149
Who let the dogs out?
Am I right?

32:18.720 --> 32:21.951
Sir, before we start, would you prefer
if we gave you a spritzer to chug?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.996
- Ah...
- Maybe a Pinot Noir?

32:29.040 --> 32:32.112
You're going down, old man.
Nobody chugs like me.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.317
I bet. You've been chugging
Brah's cum for years.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.638
Let's go.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.156
Chug!

32:45.240 --> 32:48.038
Chug! Chug!

32:48.120 --> 32:49.838
Chug!

32:49.920 --> 32:55.392
Go! Go! Chug!

33:52.360 --> 33:53.998
It's actually kind of fun.

33:57.880 --> 34:03.955
Yeah, I'm not really,
you know, for sure...

34:04.040 --> 34:05.792
...per say...

34:05.880 --> 34:07.711
...what we're doing
after graduation.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.916
I mean,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.036
- we have offers to play...
- Blah, blah, blah...

34:12.120 --> 34:13.712
...professional lacrosse in Europe,

34:13.800 --> 34:16.234
- but a bunch of agents
- Words, words, words...

34:16.320 --> 34:18.038
also want us to start modeling,
so...

34:18.159 --> 34:20.799
And again, we're talking about
this fat fuck right here?

34:20.880 --> 34:25.317
You guys... Uh, you have
to come see this right now.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.031
All right, our team won!

34:45.120 --> 34:48.998
Let's celebrate by buying local drugs

34:49.080 --> 34:52.675
from a reputable, local drug dealer.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.513
Hey, what are you doing here?

34:55.600 --> 34:56.998
I'm selling drugs, man.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.760
I'm trying to put my kid
through preschool.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.513
How honest is that!

35:01.600 --> 35:04.876
Touching my face a lot, bro.
Touching my face a whole lot, man.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.030
Why don't you take some of this.
This'Il mellow you out.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.190
- What is it?
- E-cig, bro.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.635
"E" is for "Weed"!

35:11.720 --> 35:15.315
Sure, why not?

35:15.400 --> 35:20.235
Yeah, ooh, that's a big...
That's a big one.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.118
Oh!

35:23.200 --> 35:25.236
Whoo!

35:25.320 --> 35:28.392
Just be glad you didn't smoke this, man.
This is crack!

35:28.520 --> 35:30.238
- What?
- Oh, yeah!

35:30.320 --> 35:33.278
This one... Oh, wait a minute...

35:33.400 --> 35:37.188
Maybe that one's crack
and this one's weed.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.880
Hang on. What'd you do now, Pam?

35:39.960 --> 35:42.872
Fuck. Hold on.
Which one's crack?

35:42.960 --> 35:47.238
Okay. I got this.
Don't freak out.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.675
Sorry to worry you, man.
You're not gonna believe this.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.832
- They're both crack.
- What?

35:52.960 --> 35:56.919
And you have taken an amount that will
probably kill you in about 30 minutes.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.709
- I just smoked crack?
- Yeah. But just, like, a lot.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.995
I just smoked crack.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.911
I just smoked crack!

36:11.520 --> 36:14.080
USA! USA!

36:14.160 --> 36:16.799
USA! USA!

36:16.880 --> 36:20.589
Told you.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.031
He's fine.
He's just a little drunk.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.516
Whoo!

36:28.440 --> 36:31.557
Everybody loves crack!

36:31.640 --> 36:34.837
Bee loves crack.
Bee loves some crack.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.110
We should probably go help him.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.793
Sting? You're stung!

36:45.400 --> 36:47.675
Oh, shit, I just found my queen.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.228
All right.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.279
Okay, let's help him.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.396
Excuse me. Jason!

36:59.720 --> 37:01.358
- Hey, Jason.
- Jason.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.198
- Jason.
- Jason.

37:05.280 --> 37:09.239
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.551
I'm gonna live forever!

37:22.040 --> 37:24.190
Party on!

37:38.440 --> 37:39.873
Oh, shit!

37:41.920 --> 37:44.150
One, two, three...

37:44.280 --> 37:46.840
- Hello?
- Where the fuck have you been?

37:46.920 --> 37:50.993
Uh... we got to Grandpa's a little bit
later than we thought last night,

37:51.120 --> 37:54.237
and my phone charger wasn't working.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.548
Well, you know we missed the deadline

37:55.640 --> 37:57.676
for our wedding announcement
to be in the Times.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.876
Where are you? Are you close?

37:59.960 --> 38:04.351
Um... Listen, Grandpa got
really upset last night.

38:04.440 --> 38:08.911
So I'm just getting
a little bit of a late jump here.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.752
I want to show you
the bouquets for the bridesmaids.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.034
So switch to FaceTime, okay?

38:12.120 --> 38:15.476
Shit! Baby, the reception
at Grandpa's isn't very good...

38:15.560 --> 38:18.870
- Jason, just fucking do it!
- Okay, one second. Switching over.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.793
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

38:21.880 --> 38:23.871
Is that sand on your face?

38:23.960 --> 38:26.872
It's just sawdust because I was
helping Grandpa in the garage, so...

38:26.960 --> 38:29.872
I naturally got the dust
of the saw on the face.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.349
- Hi, honey.
- Jason.

38:32.440 --> 38:37.230
- Mom? Dad?
- Is that writing on your face?

38:37.320 --> 38:41.233
Oh! I was working on my vows
late last night and...

38:41.320 --> 38:42.833
Hmm...

38:42.920 --> 38:46.799
And I fell asleep and I got
some pen on my face, so...

38:46.880 --> 38:49.155
Yeah, that must be
the exact thing that happened.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.038
Yeah, Meredith called us because
she hadn't heard from you all night.

38:52.240 --> 38:54.390
We got the rabbi here
to work on the vows.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.798
- Boker tov, Jason.
- Hey. Shalom.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.838
No, Jason, really...
What is on your forehead?

39:02.920 --> 39:06.913
It's a swastika of penises.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.399
No, that's not what it is.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.950
Acting as a pinwheel
of ejaculate...

39:12.040 --> 39:14.634
No, no, no,
it's a FaceTime effect.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.240
All the kids are using
them these days.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.038
There's a Hanukkah one. See?

39:20.040 --> 39:22.998
I don't like that one as much
as the swastika full of dicks.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.356
Okay, let's discuss
the wedding vows.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.557
Jason, why don't you
begin by telling us all

39:29.640 --> 39:32.074
what it is you like
about Meredith.

39:32.160 --> 39:35.391
Yeah, where do I start? She's...

39:35.480 --> 39:38.790
- Hello.
- Uh...

39:38.880 --> 39:42.429
- Hello, buzzy bee.
- What?

39:42.600 --> 39:44.989
If you can't think of anything,
lean into them looks, dawg.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.991
Can I touch buzzy bee?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.638
I've loved her for...
No, you can't touch buzzy bee!

39:48.720 --> 39:52.793
Um... I love the way that she, um...

39:52.880 --> 39:56.475
What are you doing? Stop it!
Go away!

39:56.560 --> 39:58.630
You're getting me in...
Fuck, go away!

39:58.720 --> 40:00.358
- Your buzzy bee looks so fluffy!
- What did he say?

40:00.440 --> 40:03.637
- I just don't know where to start.
- Let me touch buzzy bee!

40:03.720 --> 40:05.312
- You can't have the bee!
- What?

40:05.400 --> 40:06.992
I want to stroke the bee!

40:07.080 --> 40:08.600
You can't
stroke the bee! Okay?

40:09.800 --> 40:11.711
- I want to kiss buzzy bee!
- You can't kiss the bee!

40:11.800 --> 40:13.313
I love the way that she kisses.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.470
- Ow! Kid!
- Hey!

40:15.600 --> 40:17.158
- Oh, my God...
- Hey!

40:17.240 --> 40:18.195
- Fucking pervert!
- Oh, no.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.840
I got to go right now.
I'm sorry. I love you. Bye!

40:20.920 --> 40:22.831
No, no, no! Jason! Jason!

40:22.920 --> 40:25.229
Come on. I told you to stay with us.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.399
- He let me stroke it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:29.480 --> 40:31.311
Hold on! He's talking
about a pee... A bee.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.517
- A little stuffed bee.
- What bee?

40:34.600 --> 40:35.828
There was a bee here, man!

40:35.920 --> 40:38.514
It was so soft.
He let me kiss it.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.750
No, I did not let you kiss it!
What are you talking about?

40:40.840 --> 40:42.720
- He did not even... Ahh!
- You're fucking dead!

40:42.800 --> 40:44.677
Dad, that was cool!

40:44.760 --> 40:48.435
Oh, shit!

41:12.160 --> 41:15.038
Could I have some pants? Please...

41:15.120 --> 41:19.398
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I'm so sorry. Of course.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.711
Yeah, absolutely.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.315
You want khakis or sweatpants?

41:26.400 --> 41:29.437
- Khakis, please.
- What brand? You like Dockers?

41:29.520 --> 41:32.273
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

41:32.360 --> 41:36.433
You're like a 30...

41:36.520 --> 41:38.238
Yeah, 30 is fine.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.550
What I wouldn't give
to fit in a 30.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.838
Maybe 20 years ago, you know?
When I was seven years old.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.514
Yeah... all right.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.750
Also I'm gonna step out
and get some lunch.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.909
Do you want a sandwich?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.673
I would love a sandwich.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.194
- Ham? Turkey?
- Turkey?

41:56.280 --> 41:59.477
Turkey. That's so funny,
because I'm a turkey guy myself.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.869
- You know.
- Thank you so much.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.678
Okay, absolutely.
You want mayo on that?

42:03.760 --> 42:05.512
- Uh, no thank you, no.
- Okay.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.591
- Extra veggies.
- Extra veggies?

42:07.680 --> 42:09.591
- Yes, please.
- You got it. Absolutely.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.760
- And...
- Salt and vinegar.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.553
- You want salt and vinegar as well?
- Yeah, thank you.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.631
You gotta watch that sodium.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.400
That's what drives your
blood pressure up,

42:17.440 --> 42:19.237
and blood pressure is a silent killer.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.437
All right, turkey, okay... all right.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.915
Yeah. And, uh, finally,

42:25.000 --> 42:29.232
do you want to be sodomized by a man
with the mental age of seven

42:29.320 --> 42:30.878
who calls himself Ping-Pong,

42:30.960 --> 42:34.953
or do you want to be shivved by,
uh, the same guy?

42:35.040 --> 42:39.556
Just let me know what time works for
you, 'cause you're in fucking jail.

42:44.120 --> 42:47.351
All right. Gary,
I'm all done. It's late.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.876
- I gotta go open the store, buddy.
- I know, but you tried to sell peyote

42:50.960 --> 42:55.317
- to middle schoolers.
- What? Come on. It's me. Pam!

42:55.400 --> 42:59.279
Don't be a dick. Come on!
I just had watery diarrhea,

42:59.360 --> 43:01.920
I want to get out of here.
It stinks.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.309
It does stink.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.992
All right,
let's get you out of there.

43:06.080 --> 43:10.039
All right! Whoo!
I don't like being in a cage.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.554
You're letting him out?
He's the one that sold drugs.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.359
- Why are you letting him out?
- Hey, man! Not cool!

43:15.440 --> 43:17.556
That's a real dick move,
throwing me under the bus.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.993
What the fuck are you talking about?

43:19.080 --> 43:20.832
You're the one that sold drugs
last night!

43:20.920 --> 43:24.595
- Hey, guy, snitches get stitches!
- All right.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.557
So why don't you shut
your fucking mouth, bro.

43:26.640 --> 43:30.474
Yeah. Snitches get stitches,
my friend.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.074
My name's Pam.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.435
- All right.
- You're incorrigible.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.353
- Hey, how are you, Finch?
- How you doing? Good to see you.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.000
- Finchy! Finch!
- Hey! You got it.

43:41.080 --> 43:43.160
Must beautiful woman
on the police force, right here.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.993
- Jeez!
- The only woman, but...

43:46.080 --> 43:47.308
- Here's the deal.
- What's up?

43:47.400 --> 43:50.756
I came in here with a bag of drugs,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.559
I can't leave without it.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.551
- Can you guys hook me up there?
- Yep...

43:55.640 --> 43:57.437
- Ooh! Gary!
- These yours?

43:57.520 --> 44:00.239
- Yeah. Thanks, Gare-Bear.
- Oh! Nice catch.

44:00.320 --> 44:03.312
Hey, right? Please remember,
next Tuesday is the election.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.550
Vote for me for mayor.
I'm gonna win this year.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.756
- I'm gonna beat that goat.
- You got my vote.

44:07.840 --> 44:11.549
Pam! Pam!

44:11.640 --> 44:14.632
- He is just a good one.
- He is just a number one...

44:14.720 --> 44:17.678
- Lover and a fighter.
- Okay, listen.

44:17.800 --> 44:21.918
Guys, I really respect
the job you guys do.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.240
I'm being completely honest,
from the bottom of my heart,

44:24.280 --> 44:27.192
I look up to you.
I fight for the law.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.395
Thank you, no one ever
says that to us.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.038
- Ever.
- That's what I wanted to do

44:30.120 --> 44:31.235
when I was a kid.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.912
Like, I wanted to do
what you guys do.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.709
Mostly people just call us pigs
and throw bags of fast food at us.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.756
- Yeah.
- I'm incredibly sorry

44:38.840 --> 44:40.319
for all this confusion,
but listen to me, please.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.278
I have to let you know,
I am a lawyer.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.114
- Whoa! You're a lawyer?
- I am, yeah. I'm actually a lawyer.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.794
Whoa!
You don't look like a lawyer.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.269
Yeah. Yeah, I handle, like, uh,
corporate stuff.

44:52.360 --> 44:56.239
Like, uh... like LLC agreements,

44:56.320 --> 44:57.309
- LP agreements...
- You lost me.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.437
- I don't even know what that means.
- I mean, like, you...

45:00.520 --> 45:02.078
- ...you don't look Jewish.
- No.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.594
- Which is weird.
- It's actually pretty funny.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.518
There you go...

45:07.640 --> 45:11.110
That is funny!
It is so weird!

45:11.200 --> 45:12.792
- It's darkly ironic.
- It really is.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.110
Yes, exactly. Dark irony.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.556
I thought you had to be, like,
at least 80 to be a lawyer.

45:18.640 --> 45:21.029
- Like, it's a lot of school, right?
- Yeah.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.588
It's... it's, uh...
it's a lot of school.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.434
The bar...
something I took and passed.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.909
It's not something
I stand behind.

45:30.120 --> 45:34.079
Yeah. I'm not on this side, typically,

45:34.160 --> 45:37.470
and I just, uh, I just...
I know my rights,

45:37.560 --> 45:38.800
and I would love my phone call.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.148
- Objection.
- Overruled.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.913
- Permission to approach the bench?
- Denied!

45:43.000 --> 45:45.673
- What?
- It's easy to be a lawyer.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.877
- It's so easy.
- I would love my phone call.

45:48.960 --> 45:52.509
Okay. I know my rights.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.955
- I want my phone call.
- Give me my phone call!

45:55.040 --> 45:57.713
- I should have a phone call!
- This is my First Amendment right.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.997
My first, page one,
number one amendment

46:01.080 --> 46:03.355
- says that I have a telephone!
- I get a phone call.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.597
- This is my First Amendment right.
- I'm guaranteed a phone call.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.870
- I don't sound like that.
- Yeah?

46:09.960 --> 46:11.996
- What do you sound like then?
- Not like that.

46:12.120 --> 46:15.476
I don't even sound like that.

46:15.560 --> 46:18.074
- Give me my phone call.
- Oh, please, let me

46:18.160 --> 46:19.912
have my phone call.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.514
I'm an American
and I'm fucking guaranteed...

46:22.600 --> 46:24.397
I am an American...

46:24.480 --> 46:26.357
I am guaranteed a phone call.

46:26.440 --> 46:29.910
My right to have
a phone call!

46:31.440 --> 46:35.115
I just said I'm an American,
and I'm guaranteed a phone call.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.475
- Hm. Well, now he's getting demanding.
- Yeah.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.154
- We better give him his phone call.
- Better give him his phone call.

46:40.240 --> 46:44.028
- Guys, come on. Come on, please.
- Why are we doing this?

46:44.120 --> 46:45.872
This is your phone right here, right?

46:45.960 --> 46:49.032
- That is my phone, yes.
- Well, you know what?

46:49.160 --> 46:52.038
We get to make one phone call
on your phone.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.673
That's where you're a little bit
mixed up.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.557
Yeah, hopefully, you're not
out of "framily" minutes.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.870
- No, no, no.
- Get a free Uber ride on that.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.399
- Go ahead.
- Take us out to lunch.

46:59.480 --> 47:02.916
You know what? We're gonna be kind
and set you up with a Tinder account.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.309
- How about Grindr? What about, uh...
- Look at this!

47:05.400 --> 47:07.630
- Jefe, is that how you pronounce that?
- Yeah, how about Jefe.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.069
Yeah, huh? A little alone time
with Jefe?

47:10.160 --> 47:13.675
He'd like some light conversation
and heavy petting,

47:13.760 --> 47:15.432
- flirting, flirtations.
- He looks thick and lonely.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.836
You will meet him at
eight. You'll bring wine coolers.

47:18.920 --> 47:24.552
And... children's condoms.

47:24.640 --> 47:27.393
- Just gonna take a little picture.
- Snatch-chat.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.357
- Yeah, a little Snatch-chat.
- Please don't do that with my phone.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.714
Hope you got a wide-angle lens on that.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.598
Oh! Wow.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.830
Kidding.

47:37.040 --> 47:41.556
Somebody just posted his bail.
Get that pervert some pants.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.278
All right.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.112
These were
a couple pair of pants

47:45.200 --> 47:49.557
from murder victims
from a 1990s orgy gone bad.

47:49.640 --> 47:53.349
We got semen-stained
or blood-stained.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.034
Take your pick.
What's it gonna be?

47:57.160 --> 47:59.355
- Blood.
- Semen it is.

48:01.800 --> 48:04.633
- Hey, there he is.
- No.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.312
Don't even fucking talk to me.

48:06.400 --> 48:11.076
I know things got a little chaotic,
but I'm so close with Lenore...

48:11.200 --> 48:12.838
What the fuck is wrong with you?

48:12.920 --> 48:15.229
I'm about to get fucking
married, Grandpa!

48:15.320 --> 48:19.154
In one week! To a Jewish girl!
And I just woke up in fucking jail

48:19.240 --> 48:24.792
with a bunch of penises on my forehead
in the shape of a swastika!

48:24.920 --> 48:27.275
Could call it a swasticock.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.477
- What?
- It's a play on words.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.073
Oh, it's a play on words.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.231
A play on words.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.953
Play on these words.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.794
I'm dropping you off
at your old army vet buddy's house,

48:41.880 --> 48:43.677
he's gonna drive you to fucking Boca.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.876
Because I'm fucking
done with you.

48:49.120 --> 48:52.590
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- I can't help staring at your tits.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.548
- Pow!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

49:01.200 --> 49:03.350
You know, Stinky
had more confirmed kills

49:03.440 --> 49:07.353
than anyone in our platoon
back in 'Nam? 118.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.509
Shut the fuck up.

49:10.960 --> 49:13.952
- What is this place?
- I don't know. Or care.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.240
At least just come in with me.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.197
Let's make sure
it's the right house.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.111
After you.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.270
Grandson of the year.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.158
Your grandmother's
ashes are in there.

49:26.680 --> 49:28.636
She's in a coffin. Fuck you!

49:31.000 --> 49:34.037
Oh, well,
better late than never.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.554
Yeah! Fuck them up, ALF!

49:36.640 --> 49:38.392
Motherfucker!

49:38.480 --> 49:40.516
Stinky?

49:40.600 --> 49:43.478
What the fuck
are you doing here, Dick?

49:44.480 --> 49:46.471
Oh, this?

49:46.560 --> 49:49.120
This is liver failure.

49:51.920 --> 49:55.071
- Who's the lesbian?
- That's my grandson, Jason.

49:55.160 --> 49:59.153
Yeah? Is he here to scissor with me?

49:59.240 --> 50:00.912
Okay, that's just
offensive to lesbians.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.390
I am very sorry, K.D. Lang.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.431
Time for Bingo!

50:06.520 --> 50:08.909
Come on. Stinky, we got to get
you the fuck out of here.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.675
- Come on, let's go.
- I have one fucking month left, Dick!

50:12.760 --> 50:15.638
I don't want you
to remember me like this, man.

50:15.720 --> 50:18.439
I want you
to remember me as a warrior.

50:18.520 --> 50:21.432
- Please. Leave me be.
- But, Stinky...

50:21.520 --> 50:23.590
No, no, no...
Just let me finish, Dick.

50:23.680 --> 50:29.437
Leave me your beautiful lesbian grandson
so he can blowjob me to death.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.873
It's all over for me, Dick.

50:35.960 --> 50:40.795
You know, all I wanna do is play Bingo.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.359
Go.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.713
All ready?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.560
Bingo!

50:57.560 --> 51:00.836
I'm sorry about
your friend, Grandpa.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.831
So it comes to this.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.556
Even before you die,
you just stop living,

51:07.640 --> 51:10.712
and it's all one fucked-up
facsimile of the real thing.

51:16.560 --> 51:19.120
We have to go back.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.792
Yeah. I know.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.675
- I'll drive us home.
- Not Atlanta. Daytona.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.511
- What?
- I have to fuck that girl, Jason.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.194
- Jesus, Grandpa!
- I do. I have to fuck her.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.078
Grandpa, you're just depressed.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.151
You're confused right now
because of Grandma.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.430
Grandma wanted me to do this.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.670
- What?
- Yeah. She said when she died,

51:41.760 --> 51:44.638
she wanted me to move on
and live my life the way I wanted to,

51:44.720 --> 51:46.199
and right now,
you know what I want to do?

51:46.280 --> 51:48.475
I want to get my dick sucked
by that fucking college girl!

51:48.560 --> 51:50.516
What is that going to do for you?

51:50.600 --> 51:52.280
Is that going to make
you feel young again?

51:52.360 --> 51:55.113
- Yeah! Yeah, what's wrong with that?
- Yeah?

51:55.200 --> 51:57.555
Feeling young again?
What do I have?

51:57.640 --> 51:59.471
A dead wife, dying friends.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.710
A few fucking good
years left if I'm lucky.

52:01.800 --> 52:05.509
And you know what?
It fucking freaks me out!

52:05.640 --> 52:07.198
Yeah.

52:08.800 --> 52:12.076
Look, I don't expect
you to understand. You're young.

52:12.160 --> 52:15.470
You have a long, long time before
you have to look into that abyss.

52:15.560 --> 52:19.599
But the way I see it, having sex
with that girl is my last stand.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.035
And I can't do it without you.

52:22.120 --> 52:28.434
So I'm asking you. Please, Jason, just
stay one more day so I can do this.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.715
Please.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.519
Okay, Daytona Beach!
Who's ready for a Flex Off!

52:39.600 --> 52:44.390
I'm talking about dudes
getting on stage, getting ripped!

52:44.480 --> 52:46.869
Yeah!

52:46.960 --> 52:48.951
Yes, I'll be home tomorrow. I promise.

52:49.040 --> 52:50.996
And I know... Yes,

52:51.080 --> 52:52.911
I know the dinner
is important to the firm...

52:53.000 --> 52:56.754
Hold on, I'm getting another call.
It might be Meredith. Okay? Bye.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.398
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.118
Someone just stuck
their thumb up my ass.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.918
What?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.434
Yeah, I was just standing right there,
talking on the phone,

53:04.520 --> 53:07.512
and someone came right up behind me
and stuck their thumb up my ass.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.670
- Did you see who it was...
- Jamba!

53:09.760 --> 53:11.751
Ow! Fuck! Stop doing that!

53:11.840 --> 53:14.070
- How'd it go on the home front?
- How do you think?

53:14.160 --> 53:16.276
Come on. Let's go.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.590
Come on.

53:18.680 --> 53:21.558
Top Gun in the house!

53:21.640 --> 53:25.599
We got Maverick!
We got Fat Goose!

53:25.720 --> 53:28.632
Do we have a challenger?

53:28.720 --> 53:31.632
- Right here! Right here!
- These two! She wants to!

53:31.720 --> 53:33.278
- These two.
- Pick her!

53:33.360 --> 53:35.271
Who will accept this challenge?

53:35.360 --> 53:38.113
You go up there, I'll let you do
whatever you want to me tonight.

53:38.200 --> 53:40.316
- All right, I'm doing it.
- All right!

53:40.400 --> 53:41.833
- What?
- Whoo!

53:41.920 --> 53:44.229
- No, no, no!
- Are you kidding me?

53:44.320 --> 53:46.629
I saw your body last night,
it's a lot better than Cody's.

53:46.720 --> 53:49.951
And my body sure as shit looks better
than that fucking Shamu's up there.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.354
There's 1,000 people out here!

53:51.440 --> 53:53.829
A lost old man
has wandered on stage.

53:53.920 --> 53:57.151
- Are you his nurse?
- No. Fuck no.

53:57.240 --> 54:00.152
Get on stage! Get on stage!

54:00.240 --> 54:03.357
Get on stage! Get on stage!

54:03.440 --> 54:05.715
Get on stage! Get on stage!

54:05.800 --> 54:11.158
- Do it for me!
- Get on stage! Get on stage!

54:11.240 --> 54:14.277
So we have team Top Gun

54:14.360 --> 54:18.512
versus creepy old guy
and his lesbian daughter.

54:20.120 --> 54:24.432
Okay, Daytona Beach,
are you ready to Flex Off?

54:24.520 --> 54:29.389
Three! Two! One! Flex!

54:29.480 --> 54:31.596
Having trouble getting that
coat off, Fat Goose?

54:31.680 --> 54:34.148
Uh...

54:34.240 --> 54:36.356
Look at this guy!

54:36.440 --> 54:38.590
He's like
Mother Teresa's vagina!

54:38.680 --> 54:41.114
Old and tight!

54:41.200 --> 54:44.237
Hey, look,
it's Cirque du So Gay!

54:44.320 --> 54:47.437
What now?

54:49.720 --> 54:51.915
Uh-oh!
Has the old man fallen?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.433
Or is it...

54:53.560 --> 54:55.949
One-armed
motherfucking push-ups!

54:56.040 --> 54:57.598
Holy shit!

54:57.680 --> 54:59.875
Lesbian daughter's
getting in on the action!

54:59.960 --> 55:02.349
I happen to know
he smoked crack last night!

55:02.440 --> 55:05.557
These push-ups are fueled
by the devil's candy!

55:05.640 --> 55:09.235
Unbelievable!

55:09.320 --> 55:11.550
Your move, Dolly Parton.

55:11.640 --> 55:14.916
What are you gonna
do now, team Top Gun?

55:16.840 --> 55:18.114
And, hey, everybody,
don't forget to stop

55:18.200 --> 55:22.716
by Tam Pam Surf Slam in town
where I'm selling "beach towels"

55:22.800 --> 55:24.358
for 50 bucks an ounce.

55:24.440 --> 55:28.228
"Sun screen" for 10 bucks a dime bag.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.834
And I'm also selling meth!

55:30.920 --> 55:34.230
Oh! Just got married!

55:34.320 --> 55:36.914
Your move, Viagra Falls.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.231
Crowd going wild
for team Top Gun!

55:40.320 --> 55:43.676
Grandpa, I got this. Watch!

55:43.760 --> 55:47.435
Most muscular, on three.
One, two, three.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.152
Oh! I think this guy just sharted!

55:53.240 --> 55:54.593
- No, I didn't!
- Yes!

55:54.680 --> 55:57.831
Call a lifeguard, I think
there's been a shart attack!

56:08.080 --> 56:09.798
I'm not even
holding the mic right now.

56:12.960 --> 56:16.589
- You suck!
- I have an idea.

56:16.680 --> 56:18.750
Do you remember that thing
we used to do when I was a kid?

56:18.840 --> 56:20.592
Yeah.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.711
One, two, three...

56:24.800 --> 56:27.075
Hold on, what's this?

56:27.160 --> 56:31.756
What is going on?
Oh, my God, what am I seeing?

56:33.720 --> 56:35.995
Am I on drugs? Of course I am!

56:36.120 --> 56:38.680
This is too incredible!

56:38.760 --> 56:41.479
Flex Off history is being made!

56:41.560 --> 56:45.235
- What's up now, Brah?
- Yeah, what's up now, Brah?

56:45.320 --> 56:47.675
Yeah, what's up now, Brah?

56:47.760 --> 56:49.159
'Sup now, Brah?

56:49.240 --> 56:52.038
'Sup now, Brah? 'Sup now, Brah?

56:52.120 --> 56:55.192
This is incredible!
Take out your cameras!

56:55.280 --> 56:58.556
Put this online!
This shit is going viral!

56:58.640 --> 57:00.949
Shit. Let me down.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.110
Did everybody get a picture of that?

57:03.200 --> 57:05.077
What the fuck are you doing?

57:05.160 --> 57:06.991
- I can't do this...
- What?

57:07.080 --> 57:08.354
- God...
- The winners

57:08.440 --> 57:11.910
of the Alpha Delta Flex Off...
Wait a minute! Where are you going?

57:12.000 --> 57:13.797
- Guys?
- Where are you going?

57:13.880 --> 57:14.880
Jason!

57:14.960 --> 57:15.949
You can't just
leave me here like this.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.280
Why'd you stop?
We were winning!

57:17.320 --> 57:18.480
Because I'm a lawyer!

57:18.560 --> 57:20.790
I can't have people taking pictures
of me doing stuff like this.

57:20.880 --> 57:22.791
Can you imagine if the firm
saw something like that?

57:22.880 --> 57:26.873
By default, the winner
of the Flex Off is...

57:26.960 --> 57:29.235
- Bring the cup home, baby!
- ...these two dildos.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.109
Every single day,
my career's in jeopardy...

57:34.200 --> 57:36.475
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the regulator off

57:36.560 --> 57:38.869
the pneumatic propulsion system.

57:38.960 --> 57:40.393
Give me a beer.

57:40.480 --> 57:43.199
Grandpa, what did you
really do for the army?

57:43.280 --> 57:46.033
- I told you, I was a mechanic.
- Bullshit.

57:46.120 --> 57:50.113
You speak Arabic.
You hot-wired a golf cart.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.952
Tell me the truth.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.793
All right,
I was Special Forces!

57:54.880 --> 57:57.553
I trained insurgents behind
enemy lines from Vietnam to Iraq.

57:57.640 --> 57:59.392
Now give me the fucking beer can!
Come on!

57:59.480 --> 58:02.597
Look at this dummy!

58:02.680 --> 58:04.398
What an idiot!

58:09.280 --> 58:12.590
Whoo! Yeah! Do it again!

58:12.680 --> 58:15.069
We can change in Cody's room.
I picked his pocket earlier.

58:15.160 --> 58:16.832
Nothing to see here, guys.

58:16.920 --> 58:19.150
Cops are gonna
come pretty quick.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.639
No, no, this is his father,
so that's what I'm saying.

58:23.720 --> 58:25.119
Keep him heavily sedated,

58:25.200 --> 58:27.668
but don't be afraid to pull
the plug if you have to.

58:27.760 --> 58:29.512
Thank you, doctor.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.513
Okay. They're in the
hospital till tomorrow!

58:33.600 --> 58:36.558
The room's ours
for the night.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.029
Look at these
fucking people.

58:39.160 --> 58:41.435
How was brunch
at Hitler's house that day?

58:41.520 --> 58:43.909
Hey, Grandpa,
who else in our family knows

58:44.040 --> 58:46.600
that you were, uh,
Special Forces or whatever?

58:46.680 --> 58:49.240
No one, once your
grandmother passed.

58:49.320 --> 58:52.437
Your father stopped talking to me
before my missions were declassified.

58:52.520 --> 58:56.149
So he always thought
I was just an army mechanic.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.196
But don't you think that you guys
would get along a little better

58:58.280 --> 59:01.158
if you told him?

59:03.200 --> 59:05.953
Hey, come on. Let's see
how you look. Come on out.

59:10.960 --> 59:14.794
First of all, nobody wears
a fucking white belt.

59:14.880 --> 59:17.480
The only people who wear white belts
are people who suck at karate

59:17.520 --> 59:20.717
and people who suck at life.
Take the fucking belt off.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.553
And you better lose that
fucking white polo shirt

59:23.640 --> 59:25.471
and those pleated khaki pants.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.391
You're meeting up with girls,
not blowing an oil executive

59:27.480 --> 59:30.552
on a fucking golf course.
Put these on.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.996
Well, in case you forgot, I don't
even have underwear, from last night.

59:36.080 --> 59:38.116
All right, just put them on.
I'll turn around.

59:40.560 --> 59:42.915
- Nice dick.
- Aw, jeez, Grandpa.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.116
That's a good dick.
You got your grandpa's dick.

59:45.200 --> 59:47.839
Not the girth,
not the length, but same style.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.749
That's good to know.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.832
You're lucky you're not your dad.
He's got his mom's dick.

59:53.920 --> 59:55.990
What the fuck?

59:56.080 --> 59:57.672
Now put your pants on.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.752
- Shit. It's Meredith.
- Don't answer it.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.871
My rehearsal brunch
is this weekend.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.192
No calls. For one night, stop worrying
about your wedding. Please.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.475
We have two hot, smart,
beautiful college girls

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.199
at the peak of their sexual powers
about to meet us at one of

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.909
the last great nightclubs in Florida.
Worry about them.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.910
Okay.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.510
I don't think you're very
popular here, Grandpa.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.068
You're the one that's going
to have to watch out.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.038
- You might get Oreo'd.
- Oreo'd?

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.395
That's when two black guys
fuck a white guy.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.914
You're the cream in the middle.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.755
Game on.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.910
Hey! Glad you guys made it.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.595
- Let's all get fucked up. Right?
- My step dad hates me!

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.672
Let's go!

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.438
Party till you're pregnant!

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.155
Oh, my God, I love this song!

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.992
You're not gonna die on me, are you?

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.275
- I don't think so.
- All right!

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.949
- Come on.
- Oh, no. No.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.439
You want it?
Come here, give me that hat!

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.750
Oh, my God...

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.909
Give me that!
What is this?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.116
Hey! Hey, hey, hey...

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.993
Leave my illegitimate
black son alone.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.793
We were just
asking him to dance.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.714
- Well, he don't wanna dance.
- Well, maybe you wanna dance instead.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.279
- I don't wanna dance...
- Colonel Sanders!

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.112
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.668
Let's not dirty this place up.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.957
It's a shrine. Sinatra
sang here. Parking lot?

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.118
It'll be fine.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.716
How is this going to be fine?
Look at this crew.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.597
Come on.
We have a good crew too.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.793
We have no crew.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.871
Are we going to J.Crew?

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.473
Fuck J.Crew.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.195
Don't do this.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.872
I think I'm going
to have to fight them all,

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.552
so you're going to have
to take the first punch.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.552
- What?
- Okay! He's up first.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.995
Whatever.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.399
You like that shit, white boy?

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.152
Dude, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.913
What? You want next, bitch?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.992
Hey, I thought I had next.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.877
Tell him you're sorry
you made fun of him for being gay.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.674
I'm sorry I made fun
of you for being gay!

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.910
Tell him you were raised
in a different era,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.150
but now you know
it's wrong to judge people

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.470
based on their sexual orientation

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.438
and that if you had to be gay with
someone for some reason,

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.750
you know, to prevent a
terrorist attack or something,

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.359
it would be with him.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.795
What? Ow!

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.836
Say it.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.311
If I had to be gay with somebody

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.836
to prevent a terrorist attack,
it would be you!

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.913
Apology accepted.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.399
Okay.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.509
Get out of here
before I use my other arm.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.351
This ain't over.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.556
Ooh! Oh!

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.757
Now fuck off
and take Jodeci with you.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.671
Let's roll.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.710
It's too bad Lenore barfed
all over herself tonight.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.717
I definitely could have
had sex with her.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.558
Yup.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.474
I probably could have still had sex
if she just threw up on her front,

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.791
but she somehow got it all over her
back, and I would have felt bad.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.792
Well, chivalry isn't dead.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.156
I like the way you took
that haymaker tonight.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.357
Sometimes you just gotta take
that punch up front, you know?

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.352
Then things get easier
in the long run.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.831
"De Oppresso Liber."
It's written on your knife too.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.353
What does that mean?

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.353
Hey, lights out after 12:00, boys.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.078
I better not catch you swimming

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.071
across the lake
to the girls' camp, okay?

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.355
- Night.
- Good night.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.516
You know, maybe I'll find something to
do with Shadia tomorrow

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.189
and give you and Lenore
a little more alone time.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.555
I kind of feel like
we're just getting in your way.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.916
- Yeah?
- I'm sure there's something...

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.709
What the fuck?
Did you just get naked?

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.110
- It's the best way to sleep.
- Oh, my God!

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.634
I picked it up in Uganda
from the Umbatdo.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.508
Umbat-don't let your junk touch my leg
again or you're sleeping on the floor.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.157
- Night.
- Night.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.669
Jason...

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.512
The fuck! Oh, my God!

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.589
What do these guys want to cut
all the trees down for anyway?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.956
For some stupid, like, massive,
tacky entertainment complex.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.112
You know, the ones with, like, arcades
and laser tag. That sort of thing.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.919
- Laser tag? I love laser tag.
- Yeah.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.871
- When does it open?
- Nice. Thanks a lot.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.479
- Shadia!
- Hi, Griz.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.155
Oh, my God, your pics from
the Boston rally look amazing!

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.798
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.916
Sweet Hacky Sack, man.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.797
It's not a Hacky Sack, dawg.
That's the trade name.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.075
It's an organic
hemp-seed foot satchel.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.277
And what's someone from the fucking
laser tag lobby doing here?

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.078
No, I'm just
a friend of Shadia's.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.309
Just a friend.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.038
That's pretty cool, man.
What is that, a dance ball?

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.315
Fuck! What the fuck?

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.873
- You're fucking kidding me.
- It's like a...

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.520
What the fuck!

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.637
It's a 4-inch acrylic juggling orb!
Dick.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.757
Um... I'll see you guys next weekend.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.149
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Yeah? Okay. Bye.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.310
- Love your necklace.
- Bye.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.391
Hey, Griz...

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.471
Don't touch that,
it's from Laser Tag.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.560
Sorry.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.359
- They're good people. I swear.
- Let me see that.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.795
Where are you going
with these "good people"?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.156
We're heading out to the coast
to, um, charter a boat for the year.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.992
- For the year?
- Yeah.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.399
To do what?

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.273
We're documenting the effects
of climate change out on the ocean.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.877
Aren't you supposed
to graduate next weekend?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.712
Yeah.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.832
Seems to me like you're
running from something.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.638
Come on, haven't you
had to make sacrifices

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.551
to get where you are
as a photographer?

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.076
I mean, yeah, but...

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.877
That's different.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.992
Look at this.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.350
- I hate photos of myself.
- Why?

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:46.475
You look beautiful.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.997
See?

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.228
Hey.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.799
Wait, just calm down.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.555
- What?
- Shit. Yeah, we'll be right there.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.712
- What's going on?
- We gotta go.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.349
And then I came back from the bathroom
and all those black guys from the club

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:20.510
were, like, standing around
Lenore and Dr. Richards

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.716
and they were yelling at them
and threatening them

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.313
and they, like, kidnapped them!

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:27.631
- And I think one of them had a gun!
- Did you see where they took them?

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.800
No.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.229
Those guys are staying at The Tillman.
That's all I know.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.310
- Okay.
- Come on!

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:35.435
- Come on!
- Shit!

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.434
What?

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.317
- I smell marijuana.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.112
What are you going to
do with a bucket?

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.758
I don't know!

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.559
Okay, on three. Ready?

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.111
One, two, three!

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.555
Okay, let me try one more time.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.428
The GZA, the RZA,

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.556
OI' Dirty Bastard.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.797
- What's going on?
- Gang stuff.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.189
Raekwon the Chef!

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.510
And the Method Man!

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.035
Hey! Here they are!
How was the protest?

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.793
- Uh, it was good.
- Yeah, it was good.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.000
This is Lamar, Lil' Chris, Big Chris,
Murray Finkelstein.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.793
And, of course,
you've already met Ty-rizone.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.189
That nigga's crazy, man.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.748
Yeah, what's with the N-word, anyway?
I can say it. I can't say it...

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.637
You can say it
when we let you say it.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.952
Which is never. Just never say that
under any circumstances.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.514
Shotgun!

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.956

I had some of this left over
from my time in the Middle East.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.440
You throw some of this shit around,
you can really get away with anything.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.358
- Have some.
- You're smoking grass now?

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.556
Jesus, this is
a gateway drug, Grandpa.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.949
Yeah, well, you just opened
the gateway to being a pussy.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.435
- Take some.
- Yo, D. Let's fucking bounce!

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.796

you doing this

The greatest gift a grandson
can give his grandfather

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.231
is a hot college girl who wants to have
unprotected sex with him before he dies.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.996
Yeah, well, most grandpas
just want toffee.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.308

I think I'm gonna
call off my wedding.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.514
Well, when you get married,
it's for a long fucking time.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.477
And it's hard.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.950
So it damn well better be with a woman
who keeps things interesting.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.272
You know your grandmother, she tried to
grow her own pot plant once?

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880
- Really?
- Yeah,

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.996
she just wanted to see
if she could do it.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.594
She was always
surprising me like that.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.910
We also tried anal
once every five years.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.392
Sweet.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.029
I miss having someone
to share everything with.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.914
It's not fair to just keep Shadia
in the dark like this.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.231
Since we started this,
it's just been one big lie.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.153
She has no idea who I am.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.117
I have to tell her the truth.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.637
Well, maybe telling her
tonight is a little abrupt.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.792
The most important part
of a relationship is trust.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.633
- That's right.
- And I'm going to start now.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.554
Or you can just wait till
I have sex with Lenore tonight,

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.710
then you can tell Shadia everything.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.715
- No. I'm just lying.
- Jason, I'm your grandfather!

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.478
You wait till I fuck
that college girl!

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.630
- I'm telling her now.
- Jason...

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.912
Jason! Jason!

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.593
'Sup, brah?

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.191
Back off, D cups!

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.636
Well, if it isn't the "professor."

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.633
You know, it's amazing what you can find
with a name and Google these days.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.278
You're not a real professor?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.193
Oh, my God!
You lied to us. How could you.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.238
Wait, wait, wait, this is the best part.
This is the best part.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.279
Richard "Dick" Kelly,
Lieutenant Colonel

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.352
in the United States Army,

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.353
also known as the
American Gladiator "Nitro."

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.839
What the fuck did you Google?

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.674
Okay, well, there's
another best part then.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:09.198
"Jason Patrick Kelly will wed
Meredith Miriam Goldstein

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.875
at Jericho Temple
on Saturday, March 27th."

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.078
Oh, wait, that's, um, next Saturday.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.835
Wait, you're grandfather
and grandson?

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.434
Oh, my God!
That is so fucked up.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.954
That is so hot.
I mean, that is so fucked up.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.917
So... are you getting married
next weekend?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.719
I was.
I was getting married,

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.398
but then I met you,
and now I don't...

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.675
Oh, my God!
No. Don't pull that shit.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.754
I feel fucking stupid enough as it is.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.958
So you're not a professor?
Are you even a photographer?

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.794
I'm a lawyer.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.714
I handle SEC compliance.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.109
LLC agreements.
I came up here to...

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.912
Get the fuck out, Jason. Seriously.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.070
- Can I have a second to explain?
- No!

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.998
Hold up, hold up.
Not so fast, professor.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.556
For what's it worth,
I still really want to fuck you.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.949
- And we're going to fuck.
- Yeah, we are.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.713
- We're going to thunder fuck.
- You're gonna tsunami on my face!

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.195
You're gonna flood like the Nile.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.475
Yeah. I guess the drought
in my pussy is finally over.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.710
The villagers will finally eat.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.199
You're gonna die
while you're eating me out.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.077
I want your last breath
to be in my pussy.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.309
Lenore!
You're such a slut.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.631
- Police!
- That's right. Po-po in the ho-ho.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.472
Some kind of ganja party?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.233
- Sorry to harsh your mellows.
- Where's my e-vite?

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.918
- Is that the jacket?
- Check the right coat pocket.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.069
- Check it, man.
- Okay, turn around. Come on.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.720
That's my jacket.
That's not his jacket.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.949
Up against the palm. There you go.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.951
Let's have a look.
What've you got in here? Huh?

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.268
- Bingo-bango.
- OMG.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.078
What the fuck?
That's not mine!

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.196
- "What the fuck?"
- That's not mine!

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.478
The fuck? Well, it looks like
Spring Break is finally drug free!

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.232
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, pretty boy.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.673
Oh, shall we?

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.990
No, it doesn't go down that way.
Let's go.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.160
I'll wait for you, Grandpa.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.952
Keep that shit tight for me!

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.190
He's my Henry Miller.

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.590
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Exactly!

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.318
Hey, there he is.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.675
You got blood on your pants, you know.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.398
Your license
isn't even suspended, is it?

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.550
You made all this up just so
I'd come down here with you.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.599
- I had to make sure you'd come.
- Fuck you!

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.319
Just chill, Jason.
Hakuna matata.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.553
Who the fuck are you?

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.676
I should have known
you were fucking crazy

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.752
the moment you started hitting on women
the day after Grandma's funeral!

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.796
Don't you fucking judge me.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.911
You have no idea
what I had with your grandmother.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.151
And everything I've done these
last few days I've done for a reason.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.595
You were about to fuck up
royally by getting married,

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.073
- and you fucking know it!
- Oh, yeah?

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:52.038
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.236
Chase around some college girl

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.197
that doesn't even
want to fucking talk to me?

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.635
Not know what the fuck I'm doing
for the rest of my life?

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.756
Yeah, because at least you'd be thinking
for yourself for a change.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.354
- What the fuck does that even mean?
- Your father has lorded over

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.908
every decision
you've made in your adult life,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.070
and Meredith is just
the latest example of that!

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.798
She's not right for you, Jason.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.552
If you marry her,
you're going to be sleepwalking

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.551
through the rest of your life
and be completely unhappy,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.518
- just like your father!
- I am already unhappy with my life,

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.876
because I've done nothing
but get fucked by you

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.594
and this insane fuck rampage
that you've been on.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.195
It wasn't a "fuck rampage" for me.
It was a "fuck rampage" for you.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.317
- How? How is this for me?
- I fucked up as a father.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.278
I wasn't there to raise your dad
and he turned into a materialistic,

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.670
henpecked, poop-dick country clubber.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.799
- I don't want that to happen to you.
- So that's what this was?

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.558
I was your last-ditch
redemption project.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.956
Congratulations, Grandpa.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.156
You thought you were a shitty father?

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.711
Now you're a shitty grandfather.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.359
I don't want to see you
at my wedding.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.317
Stay the fuck away from me.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.873
So, do you like this size, or this size?

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.235
Hey, hon, the people at the venue

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.470
said they don't have
enough mint napkins,

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.870
so which one do you like better?

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.238
The seafoam or the pistachio?

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.595
I'll get it.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.835
What is it?

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:36.151
Oh, it's, uh...
Just another wedding present.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.916
I hope it's that new big dipping spoon
from Williams-Sonoma.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.874
...and as a tribute
to Meredith and Jason

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.712
and the love that you guys share.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.677
A love I will never know
because my dog

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.070
died the first day I masturbated.
So now I can't get hard unless...

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.195
Okay.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.829
Also, we've got to stop ISIS.
It's gotten... It's too much.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.951
Got it. Got it.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.033
You know, today's celebration
is much more

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.509
than just about the union
of two people,

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.797
it's also about the union
of two families.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.553
- Meredith...
- The Kellys and the Goldsteins.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.632
Let's have Jason and Meredith
tell their own story.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.909
Nice job, Uncle Dave!

What the fuck?

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.756
That is not Martha's Vineyard.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.479
Jason!

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.190
- T ake it off!
- Trying, dear. Trying.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.794
- Leave them on.
- Shut it down.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.632
I have something to say.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.278
I think I've been listening
to everybody else

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.476
about what I should be
doing with my life.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.120
My grandpa said something
really interesting.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.634
All right, cut the mics.
I'm going up.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.838
...take that punch, that point forward,
things get easier.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.431
- The mic's off.
- Jason, your mic cut out.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520
What?

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.431
Your mic cut out at the
most inopportune time,

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.876
so we can't hear
why you want to leave those images up.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.917
Hitting it won't work.
If they caught it from the PA... Band?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.115
What the fuck?

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.714
Nick, can you
tell her something for me?

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.678
Can you tell her
that, uh...

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.433
I'm really sorry,
but I can't marry her.

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.433
You think that message
should come from me? Okay...

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.435
Uncle Ramon, can you tell
Meredith that Jason's sorry,

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.636
but that they can't get married?

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.913
Oh, fuck!

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.912
I forgot Uncle Ramon was deaf
and I talked to him like a normal.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.749
Uncle Ruben, can you please tell
Meredith that Jason is really sorry,

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.910
but that he can't marry her?

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:58.797
He says he's very
sorry, but he can't marry you.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.350
Uncle Ruben, can you turn
that thing up a little?

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.670
It doesn't get any louder.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.637
Where'd you get
that thing, SkyMall?

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.358
At this point, I'm kind of nervous that
anybody I pick will have a disability.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.238
Okay... Waiter...
Hey, Pubes.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.031
Can you please go tell Meredith
that my cousin Jason is very sorry,

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.348
but they cannot get married?

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.593
Come on, man.
It's my first day...

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.000
I know it's your first day,

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.871
but everybody needs
you to be a man here.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.439
Okay.

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.997
Just real quick...

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.152
He sent me...
He wants me to tell you that...

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.151
Um...

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.470
He doesn't think that he can marry you.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.199
But that he's sorry that he can't.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.028
She's laughing, so I think
that you're in the clear, bro.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.678
No, it's good.
That was good.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.796
You can just go back and tell him

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.236
that I fucked his cousin Nick
while he was gone.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.672
She's so super cool about it.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.157
She's like,
"Go! Do your thing. Do you."

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.198
- She said that?
- That's what she said, verbatim.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.111
Wait. Should I come down and say bye?

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.872
- No. God! Fuck no!
- No?

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.632
Yeah. No need to even...
Let's not even...

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.188
You just... I've done it...
We're great!

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.238
Wait, where the fuck is he going?

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.749
Jason! Jason!

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.598
It's actually the guy
on the moped with the iPad.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.593
NSA stopped using
utility vans years ago.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.796
I figured once you sent
the camera back,

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.871
it was time to take
drastic measures.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.951
What'd he say?
Are we doing this?

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.315
Plan B,
have Pam kidnap you.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.710
- I've got to get her back.
- You want me to kidnap her?

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.836
I'll bring her back to you
in a box, bro.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.832
She's on a bus headed west
on I-85 across Florida.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.070
Her boat leaves in four hours.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.799
It was easy to track her down because
of the whole Middle Eastern thing.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.792
Bet you never thought you'd 69 a girl
because of the Patriot Act.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.235
You 69 her, man!

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.038
And then she's dead.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.878
Are you kidding me, Pam?
This is what you drive?

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.155
Oh, yeah, it is so easy
selling kids drugs

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.117
from an ice cream truck. It's crazy!

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.953
- Jason! Jason!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.393
Jason, stop! Stop right now.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.754
Stop! Stop!

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.711
If you leave right now, you can
kiss your job at the firm goodbye!

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.876
David, will you get
the fuck out of the way!

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.117
Hey, hey! Come on!
What the hell!

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.794
Hey, guy, unless you want
a Chipwich or some heroin,

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.279
get off my ice cream truck!

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.634
Who the fuck is this slob?

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.473
Slob? I am a small business owner!

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.312
I am the backbone of this country!

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.749
I am holding a Taser!

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.796
- Whoa! Shit!
- Dude, should I stop?

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.915
- What are you...
- I'm kind of in the middle

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
of it right here.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.991
Shit! All right.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.995
Raise your hand
if you've got a boner!

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.280
What were we supposed to do?
Just leave him on the side of road?

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:07.670
Hey, man, can you slow down?
You're making this very difficult.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.480
What the fuck! That was you who drew
all those dicks on me last week?

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.835
- Yeah, I drew the dicks. Busted!
- Oh, my God!

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.319
Oh, shit!

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.072
Don't worry. Get up.
We'll cut through the back roads.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.912
- Wait, what?
- You navigate. I'll drive.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.354
Watch out! Watch out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.277
What the hell, man?

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.672
What the hell is going on?

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.711
- Whoa! Got ourselves a bogey.
- All right, let's do this!

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.750
Fuck! We gotta lose some of this weight.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.677
Pam, throw some
of this shit out of here!

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:55.634
Hey, look, it's Pam.
He's the good kind of Greek.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.988
Hey!

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:58.433
Hey, Gene.
Hey, Gary.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.272
How do you know
how to drive like that, Dad?

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.271
Damn it, Grandpa.
Just tell him!

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.591
Uh... I was a Green Beret
in Special Forces.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.910
I taught insurgents
behind enemy lines.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.558
Mechanic was just my cover.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.676
Good! We're all made up!

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.797
There they are!
That's them! Let's go, go, go!

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.191
- Shadia!
- Jason?

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.033
Stop the bus!
I need to talk to you!

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.155
What are you doing here

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.719
- in an ice cream truck?
- Stop the bus!

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.119
- Okay!
- Pull over!

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.191
I'm not pulling over!

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.078
Thanks a lot, Pam!
You narc!

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.596
What! I'm not a narc, Barry!
Fuck you!

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:40.948
Pam, you know him?

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.951
Barry? Yeah, he's, like,
my best friend.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.270
I sold him, like,
six tons of ecstasy... Oh!

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.749
That's why they're not
stopping the bus.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:51.753
It's full of drugs.
Classic Pam.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.239
- I know that man.
- Stop the bus!

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.557
- Jason, where are you going?
- What are you doing?

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.712
What are they...

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.599
You'd better marry that girl.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.035
Me? Nah, she's not really
my type. Too skinny.

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.558
What the fuck?

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.358
Slow down!
Oh, my God!

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.357
What are you doing?

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.436
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.589
Slow down, dude!

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.116
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go get her, man!

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.038
What is going on?
What just happened?

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.590
Hey. I don't even fucking know,
but I'm not getting married.

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:56.629
Okay, so that makes it okay
that you were lying to me?

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.948
No. No, it doesn't.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.589
But you have to admit that
when we were together it felt great.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.633
- There was something real there.
- Yeah.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:13.112
- What do you want from me, Jason?
- I want you to stay.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.712
I just can't stay.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.390
Okay.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.789
No, I get it.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.791
Yeah.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.953
What if I come with you?

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.472
Come...

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.438
- Really?
- I mean...

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.390
I just broke up with my fiancée,
lost my job.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.914
And I think I'm wanted
by the police, so...

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.195
A year at sea...

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.275
...might actually be
the best place for me.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.636
Okay.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.518
- Break it up, lesbians! Let's go.
- Get down on the ground!

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.200
We're doing this because
you're lesbians!

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.759
Get down on the ground!

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:23.998
According to
lnterstate Statute 17.37,

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.594
arrests made on the
lnterstate Highway System

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.757
must be executed by state police,
not your local law enforcement

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.796
from your adjacent municipalities.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.236
You seem, like, really familiar
with the penal code.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.676
You seem real cocksure about
the juris-dick-tion you're in.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.718
Real cocksure! Someone drew dicks
all over your face, you idiot!

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.791
Well, look at that!
You got dicks on your face.

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.440
That middle one's mine.
Look it, this one right here.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.988
- I traced it.
- I thought I recognized that!

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.475
Enough catching up.
Let my friends go.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.074
They've literally
done nothing wrong.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.390
Pam, we've got obstruction
of justice here.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:00.314
- We got reckless endangerment.
- The bus is full of drugs, I get it.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.118
Ooh, speaking of which,
I've got to get out of here.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.192
I got three keys of "Frisbees" showing
up to the store today, so...

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.478
- I should go, question mark?
- Why don't you take my squad car.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.879
That's a good idea.
Give him your keys.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.269
- You mean these keys?
- There they are.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.392
- Get out!
- Classic Pam.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.476
Classic Pam.
What do you say we get some lunch?

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.595
Love it.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.511
See you fucks later.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.833
So, uh, I'm gonna go with her.

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.548
Yeah, you should.
She seems real nice.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.675
You know, I think this is
our only way back now,

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.230
so I'm gonna try to get these
cocks off of my face

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.959
and get that truck started.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.635
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.840
Grandpa...

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.275
- Thank you for...
- Don't give me any of that shit.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.038
Just let me know when you get back.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.590
And I actually want to see
your photos in Time magazine.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.877
This camera set me back
three months of my army pension!

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.879
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:32.310
- Oh, and, Jason...
- Yeah?

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.276
Back in the '80s,
when Andre the Giant

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.238
used to go to the Playboy Mansion,

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.756
he'd stack five playmates
on top of each other on a bed

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.956
and fingerfuck them all.
Five at a time.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.837
Because his hands were so big.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.199
So... that's it.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.440
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.317
"De Oppresso Liber."

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.632
Motto of the Green Berets.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.031
It means "to liberate the oppressed."

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.033
- Hey. You ready?
- Yep.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.312
I don't think he's gonna find
anybody as good as me.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.151
I'm sorry, but you know what they say...

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:43.232
Um... tough times

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.198
can sometimes lead to tougher people.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.158
- Hm.
- That's Kurt Vonnegut.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.872
Yeah.

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.828
Holy fucking shit!

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.830
Has anyone ever told you
that you have the pussy

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.069
of an English sheepdog?

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.632
Well, thanks for the ride.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.313
You gonna be okay, Dad?

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.238
I miss her.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.918
But I'll be okay.

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:51.035
- I was a shitty father and I'm sorry.
- Well, we'll work on it.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.674
You're a hard man
to track down, professor.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.392
- Are those my pants?
- Yeah, these are your pants.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.391
I found a Werther's
Original in the pocket

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.311
and I've been
sucking on it all morning.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.915
You do know that
I'm not a professor, right?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.115
Yeah, I know.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.760
You're just a dirty, dirty grandpa,

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.912
and I'm just a girl
from Long lsland City

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.592
who likes to fuck old people.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.592
I like your pull-out couch.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.478
Yeah, well, I got news for you.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.836
That's the only thing
that's gonna be pulling out tonight.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.512
I'll be right back.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.959
Oh, hey.

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.636
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know if I can do this.

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.119
I haven't done it for a long time.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.238
Whoops! I guess they just slipped off.

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.758
I want you to tear open my bra
like it's a social security check.

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.755
Tell me you've fallen
and you can't get up.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.673
"Help, I've fallen
and I can't get up."

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.988
Oh, no!

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.113
Now fumble around and pretend like
you're trying to find your glasses.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.316
"I'm trying to find my glasses.
I can't see.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:03.549
I found them! I can see! I can see!"

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.677
Tell me it's 4:00
and you want to eat dinner.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.910
"It's 4:00 and I want to eat dinner."

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.473
Tell me the buttons
on your remote control

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.710
are so small
that you can't find Fox News.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.509
"The buttons on my remote control
are so small I can't find Fox News!"

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.875
- Tell me how small they are!
- "They're real small!"

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.800
Tell me how this neighborhood
used to be safer!

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.353
"This neighborhood used to be safer!"

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.476
Tell me how things were
better under Eisenhower!

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.596
"Things were better under Eisenhower!"

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:29.513
- We like Ike!
- We like Ike!

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:37.029
We like lke!

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.280
Are you cumming or dying?

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.993
I'm not sure! Maybe both!

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.679
"...for as by a man came death.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:04.271
By a man has come also life."

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.591
Richard Kelly II.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.638
Congratulations
on the baby's new godparents,

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.597
- Jason and Shadia.
- Aww!

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.908
Congratulations!

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.756
Back to Mommy. All baptized.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.671
You just keep surprising me, Grandpa.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:25.552
New dad at 72.
Great fucking idea.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.198
Hey, watch your potty mouth!

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.475
- Jesus, sorry...
- Yeah, clean up your language.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.596
And show some respect
for your new grandmother!

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.200
- I'm sorry, honey.
- That's all right.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.113
And sweetie, would it kill
you to visit us sometimes?

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.272
- We never see you.
- Sorry, Nanna.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.430
Did you get that card I sent
for your birthday?

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.669
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.031
Yeah, with the $12 check?
It was a very nice touch. Thank you.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.793
Thank you, that's right.
Hey, are you gaining some weight?

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.871
- You look a little heavy in the face.
- No, what are you talking about?

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:52.440
- Where'd this come from, huh?
- What?

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.709
- You wanna...
- Where'd these guys come from?

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.000
- What?
- Wanna go get the car?

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.109
- Yeah. All right.
- Okay.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.998
I'll pull around the minivan.
Go to Daddy.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.471
There we go, come to Daddy.
All right.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.558
It's a little bit weird.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.032
She's my grandma.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.950
And you're my uncle.

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.469
- Look at that.
- Holy shit!

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.233
- It's a good dick.
- Oh, my God! Put that away.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.639
- It's our dick.
- Yeah.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.312
I'm just relieved
it's not his dick.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.678
You want to get the bottle for me?

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.512
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey! What you doing there?

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.318
Hey, Jason, you should
check your diaper, bro.

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.072
I think you just shit your pants.

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:41.550
And in church, too,
in front of God?

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.358
I don't get why you're here.

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.798
Oh! Someone made a doodie
in their yum-yum!

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.840
I'm just gonna put this out there once.
I know your baby just got baptized.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:55.276
But I've got a guy in Tampa
who will pay upwards of 60 grand

01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.309
for a healthy, white,
male baby that can fight.

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:01.799
This is a good deal,
you should take it.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.673
I don't know this guy that well,
but he seems extremely trustworthy.

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.870
Oh, yeah. You interested?

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.520
- Classic Pam.
- Classic Pam.

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:12.068
Knock-knock.
Who's there? Classic Pam.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.075
Guess it's never too late
to start over.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.799
Yeah, nice to have a second chance.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.395
Maybe it won't take me so long
to get the father thing right this time.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.398
Right?

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.072
I'll go get his car seat.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.797
Jamba!
