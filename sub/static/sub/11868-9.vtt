WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.044
HENRY: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.493
I'm pregnant.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.709
Our new mayor elect is...

00:07.841 --> 00:09.126
Mr. Henry Deacon.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.294
No!

00:10.761 --> 00:13.798
I think I figured out
why your hormones are
so out of whack.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.011
You're having twins.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.926
MANSFIELD: You've allowed
a breach of security

00:17.059 --> 00:19.516
turn into a potential
town-wide catastrophe.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.975
MANSFIELD: Where's Thorne?

00:21.104 --> 00:22.685
I want you to arrest her.

00:23.232 --> 00:26.474
You disobeyed a direct
order, and this time I can't
look the other way.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.443
Eureka no longer
requires your services.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.983
You are fired, Carter.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.327
TURNER: This is a very
impressive resume, Mr. Carter.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.742
You've had a long career
in law enforcement.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.831
There's never
been anything else
I wanted to do.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.749
Experience matters to us
at the Department of
Homeland Security.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.166
Now, for the last
two years,

00:49.299 --> 00:51.210
you've been in
small community
policing.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.088
I grew up in
a small town myself.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.052
Anything exciting
everhappen?

00:57.933 --> 00:58.922
(SCREAMING)

01:03.230 --> 01:04.265
What are you doing?

01:09.736 --> 01:11.476
Just your normal
small-town stuff.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.105
HENRY: So, how did
the meeting go?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.277
It's a little weird
interviewing for a new job

01:16.410 --> 01:18.150
when you can't actually talk
about your old job.
Right.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.743
The government has to
protect its secrets,
you know,

01:19.871 --> 01:21.827
and you've seen a lot
since you've come
to Eureka.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.493
Well, you didn't
tell me about it,
and compared to this,

01:23.625 --> 01:25.206
Homeland Security's
gonna be dull.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.418
Jack, forgive me,
but I'm actually hoping
you don't get the job.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.162
I got to go.
Sure. Anything
I can help with?

01:30.841 --> 01:33.332
Well, I'm
trying to nail down a
radio diffraction grating,

01:33.468 --> 01:35.845
the EHF
antenna array.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.132
It's still
getting crackles.
What do you think?

01:38.974 --> 01:40.885
Good luck. Yeah.
Gotcha.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.641
Hey!

01:44.605 --> 01:46.391
Hi.
Did they offer you
thejob?

01:46.523 --> 01:47.933
Well, they told me
they'd let me know.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.351
But, when?
When will they
let you know?

01:49.484 --> 01:50.894
I mean, will we have
to move right away, or...

01:51.028 --> 01:54.020
(CHUCKLES) I don't know,
but no more Vinspresso
for you. Okay?

01:54.156 --> 01:56.272
Wow. My life is
in complete turmoil,

01:56.408 --> 01:57.614
and you think
it's hilarious?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.108
No. I don't.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.407
I mean, in fact, I told them
I can't start until
you finish the semester.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.366
I'm gonna make this
as easy on you as I can.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.490
Okay.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.664
Vince! Can I get
a burger?

02:09.796 --> 02:11.377
A simple meal
for a simple man.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.255
It's not gonna be the same
without you, Sheriff.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.715
Vince, can you try
and hold it together

02:15.844 --> 02:18.085
forjust, like,
one second, please?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.300
Thanks, Vince.

02:23.894 --> 02:27.887
Wow, a coffee and a donut.
You're already eating
like a sheriff.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.391
It's a 16—grain
protein bagel,
and I am not Sheriff.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.815
All right, "Acting Sheriff,"
just until the DOD.
makes it official.

02:35.947 --> 02:36.902
You happy?

02:37.032 --> 02:41.776
Carter, you know
I've always wanted yourjob,
and I deserve it.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.699
And I'll probably do it
better than you did.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.207
Yeah. You will.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.288
I want it,
but not like this.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.162
I know.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.294
I'm proud of you anyway.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.541
(CHUCKLES)

02:58.470 --> 03:01.007
Hey.
Hey! Look at you!

03:01.264 --> 03:02.344
(CHUCKLES)

03:02.933 --> 03:06.642
Yeah, it's hard not to.
I'm starting to create
my own gravitational field.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.512
Yeah, well,
it agrees with you,
being pregnant.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.229
Actually, I needed to see
the both of you.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.269
l have news about
the sheriff's position.

03:13.402 --> 03:16.769
General Mansfield
came around and he is
gonna rehire Carter?

03:17.864 --> 03:18.853
No.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.533
Congratulations,
Sheriff Lupo.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.078
And it's not
Jo, either. Sorry.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.449
They have hired a replacement.
He will be here any minute.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.799
So,
I guess he sent
his stuff ahead.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.964
And he's late
on his first day.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.130
Well, they gave me
his phone number.
Let me give him a call.

03:45.934 --> 03:50.894
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

03:51.022 --> 03:53.013
He sent his
cell phone ahead?

03:53.150 --> 03:57.234
(RINGING CONTINUES)

04:01.867 --> 04:03.858
Hello, Dr. Blake,
Deputy Lupo.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.575
And you must be...

04:08.039 --> 04:09.165
That's very creepy.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.703
That is the latest
in dynamic copolymers.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.418
(GROANS) Is this one of
your freaky inventions?

04:15.922 --> 04:20.131
No. This is
a $2.9 billion
D.O.D. program.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.468
I'll have him on duty
in two shakes of an
artificial lamb's tail.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.586
"On duty"?

04:24.723 --> 04:28.341
Fargo, are you saying
that the new sheriff
of Eureka is a robot?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.968
The biggest advance
in soft robotics
since the Furby.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.729
Well, you...
Well, you can't expect
just any anthropomorph

04:34.858 --> 04:37.019
to replace
Sheriff Jack Carter.

04:37.152 --> 04:40.269
That's it.
Passed over again?
I don't think so.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.104
Come on, Jo.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.902
I quit. lam not
working for that

04:45.869 --> 04:46.858
thing!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.952
Jo!

05:14.689 --> 05:16.225
You can call me
Sheriff Andy.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.023
Hi, Sheriff Andy.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.938
(ELECTRONIC GEARS WHIRRING)

05:37.963 --> 05:40.796
Eureka can't have
an experiment in charge
of law enforcement.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.755
You needed a sheriff,
and the prototype
was ready.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.875
Or would you prefer
to leave the position
vacant?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.672
I would prefer
rehiring Carter.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.548
Sheriff Andy is programmed
with the latest protocols
in criminal investigation.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.300
He is designed to be
ahead of the problem,
unlike Carter.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.052
Look, I know
Carter has a unique
investigative style,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.895
but his record
speaks for itself.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.309
Yes, it does.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.359
Dr. Blake, you are
now the sole head
of Global Dynamics.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.151
Your plate is full.
Don't waste your time
worrying about Carter.

06:09.995 --> 06:10.950
(SIGHS)

06:12.163 --> 06:13.152
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

06:13.290 --> 06:14.496
SARAH: Good evening, Sheriff.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.909
Yeah, not so much.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.290
What's this?
SARAH: Ask your sister.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.833
Oh, why doesn't that
surprise me?

06:23.341 --> 06:24.330
Lex?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.924
(LAUGHING) Oh, come on,
Jack. Look, it's so cool.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.544
What is...
Let me guess. Uh...

06:30.473 --> 06:32.429
What, a baby aquarium?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.720
No, it's a
tensor field generator.

06:34.853 --> 06:38.311
It creates sort of
a zero-gravity bubble,

06:38.440 --> 06:39.805
(STIFLING LAUGHTER)
andits
totally portable

06:39.941 --> 06:41.977
and easy to use.
For my home birth!

06:42.527 --> 06:45.109
Dr. Fielding says,
this way, when my
babies are born,

06:45.238 --> 06:48.105
they'll just
sort of drift,
totally weightless.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.903
Not weightless, Lexi.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.277
The tensor field repulses
most of the gravitons,

06:53.413 --> 06:57.827
but the subject
retains 0.0096%
of its original weight.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.792
Weightless enough for me.
I've gained 10 pounds
in the last day.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.627
What? Ten pounds?
Shut up.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.542
You try making
two whole people.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.709
Fair enough.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.585
I'll, uh, come back
for the generator
at a, uh...

07:10.305 --> 07:11.420
At a better time.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.923
Dr. Fielding, it's nice
to see you again.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.936
Pleasure.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.516
I had to cite him for
overloading the power grid
a little while back.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.814
Try to be nice.
I'm trying to get
the twin discount.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.357
All right.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.943
Lex, are you sure
you should be planning
all this stuff?

07:31.076 --> 07:32.987
I mean, we're not
even gonna be here
when the babies are born.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.451
Oh, stop it.
You're not going anywhere.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.072
SARAH: Excuse me, Sheriff.
I'm monitoring a bulletin
on the public safety network.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.541
Numerous fallen trees
have blocked the road.

07:41.670 --> 07:45.037
Oh, you can get
Sheriff in a Box
to handle that one.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.038
Dr. Blake was involved.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.010
OFFICER: Keep clear.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.471
Allison! Hey.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.138
You okay?
Yeah, um, I'm fine.
The road's just blocked.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.680
We're trying to get
a crew out here.

08:02.232 --> 08:06.350
Mr. Carter, I believe
public safety is no longer
under yourjurisdiction.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.647
Yeah, I'm just out
making sure
everybody's okay.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.021
Appreciate your concern.
Sheriff Andy
has been notified.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.192
Clearly everything's fine.

You all right?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.283
You okay?
Yeah.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.626
All right, everybody...
(SIREN WARBLING)

08:25.755 --> 08:28.918
Everybody get away
from the tree line!
Come on back!

08:30.593 --> 08:32.879
How are you, tonight?
Evening, folks.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.880
Seems like
you found yourselves
a bit of excitement, huh?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.597
Welcome to Eureka,
Sheriff Andy.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.136
Thank you
kindly, sir.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.681
Mr. Carter, we didn't
get a chance to talk
when you were unpacking me.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.644
Yeah, I... I know.
Look, we... There's time
for chitchat later.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.853
Right now, we've got
to stop the traffic, we...

08:44.983 --> 08:48.316
Done. I've dispatched
a couple of roadblock drones.
They should be on station...

08:49.279 --> 08:50.268
(WHIRRING)

08:50.780 --> 08:52.896
Ah, and there they are.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.107
We also got to get
a medical team.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.154
Don't you worry about it.
I've got it covered.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.947
I've got a complete suite
of medical diagnostic tools.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.659
Just some
frayed nerves, is all.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.162
Excuse me. Dr. Blake,
your baby is A-okay.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.587
Amniotic fluid levels,
pulse ox, all
perfectly normal.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.050
Pregnancy is
such a miracle,
don't you think?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.134
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.754
Seems like Sheriff Andy
has everything under control.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.257
I sure do, but
thank you so much
for your assist.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.849
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

09:21.978 --> 09:24.765
All right, people,
move away from
the tree line!

09:24.898 --> 09:28.766
Dr. Blake, I'm sure
you want to observe
your new sheriff in action.

09:29.986 --> 09:34.320
ANDY: All right, people,
move to the side of the road,
away from the tree line.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.566
ANDY: You, sir, please...
I guess I'll get
out of the way.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.069
ANDY: Thank you, sir.
Excellent. We're gonna
get this cleared up...

09:45.335 --> 09:46.495
Hit me, Vince.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.370
Are you sure, Sheriff...
Jack... Uh, Mr. Carter?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.495
Yeah.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.042
Okay.
Thanks.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.042
Hey.

09:56.179 --> 09:59.216
You're not gonna find
what you're looking for
at the bottom of that glass.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.965
Well, what if I'm looking
for a banana milkshake?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.512
Well, then
you're good.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.387
So, what do you think
brought those trees down?

10:06.523 --> 10:08.104
So far, it looks
like an accident.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.770
Really? Is that what
the new sheriff told you?

10:10.902 --> 10:12.813
It's his preliminary
findings,

10:12.946 --> 10:14.231
and he's not
my new anything.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.027
You can't be replaced
by six feet of nanopolymer
with a nice smile.

10:20.912 --> 10:24.621
So, um, the DHS called.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.158
They offered me the job.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.876
Oh!

10:31.923 --> 10:34.665
Well, that's, uh,
good news.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.884
Yeah. Yeah.
They need me to start
right away, just a few days.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.676
Oh, well,
you should be packing.
What are you doing here?

10:42.809 --> 10:43.924
(CHUCKLES)

10:45.562 --> 10:46.893
Hiding from my daughter.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.478
ZOE: This officially sucks!
I mean, you told me

10:49.607 --> 10:51.017
we wouldn't have to leave
until after the semester.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.016
You promised.
Yeah, and I know
the timing is crappy,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.233
but this is the
rightjob for me.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.442
You already have
the rightjob.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.654
I know, and they
hired someone else.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.113
So, they bring in
RoboCop,

10:59.242 --> 11:02.780
and l have to leave my friends
and my boyfriend in two days.
How is that fair?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.574
(DOORBELL CHIMES)
SARAH: Speaking of RoboCop,
there's someone at the door.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.248
Hey, there.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.743
Gee, I hope I didn't
catch you at a bad time.
Mmm.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.836
You must be
Zoe. Hello.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.830
Bite me,
Terminator.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.381
We're kind of
in the middle, here.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.753
Well, I'll be quick.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.723
I'm doing
an office inventory,
and I need your uniform.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.807
It's strictly
for papenNork.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.556
Sure.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.845
Sure.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.396
Nice place!

11:37.280 --> 11:39.396
Thank you.
I'll get out of your way.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.614
Uh, Andy? Question.

11:41.743 --> 11:46.453
Um, do you think
those trees came down
by accident?

11:46.581 --> 11:48.788
Yes, sir,
the impact pattern
seems perfectly natural.

11:48.917 --> 11:54.583
Yes. Yes,
but trees don't just
fall down by themselves.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.999
(LAUGHS)

11:56.925 --> 11:58.790
Actually, Jack...
I mean, in Eureka.

11:58.927 --> 12:02.590
In Eureka, when a tree
falls in the forest,
it's notjust a tree.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.633
Hmm.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.016
I am completely confident
in the results
of my investigation,

12:08.144 --> 12:10.305
but thank you so much
for your advice.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.559
What do you
think, SARAH?

12:14.692 --> 12:18.025
IbeHeve
the saccharine sheriff act
is getting quite tiresome.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.736
I mean, is it natural
for a dozen trees to
come down all by themselves?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.821
I mean, uh,
were the roots
rotting? Were...

12:22.951 --> 12:26.785
My analysis of
the wood samples does indicate
genetic abnormalities.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.278
How'd you get
wood samples?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.905
The artificial sheriff
had debris on his shoes.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.953
He tracked it on my carpet.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.827
Thank you.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.127
(WHISPERING) Allison!
Hey. Um,

12:41.344 --> 12:43.084
I need a tree guy.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.836
(CHUCKLES) Excuse me?

12:44.973 --> 12:47.965
I need someone
who studies, um,
tree genes.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.090
Does anyone
actually study that?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.718
Yeah, of course
there's someone.
A dendrological geneticist.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.390
Great. Need
one of those.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.014
Carter,
your security clearance
has been revoked.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.015
I can't talk to you
about G.D. personnel.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.688
Well, you can't
just forget about it

12:59.821 --> 13:01.937
just because the Tin Man
says it was an accident.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.780
Yes, and just because
he's a robot doesn't mean
that he's wrong.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.115
But, he's been here
for half a day.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.360
I mean, it takes
a lot longer than that
to understand this town.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.488
And... I mean,
we got lucky.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.707
I bet,
if more trees fall down,
somebody could get killed.

13:14.836 --> 13:15.996
lcan't. l...

13:17.755 --> 13:22.089
I can't tell you
that Dr. Leonardo is
the top G.D. dendrologist,

13:22.218 --> 13:24.834
and that she's working
on increasing xylem
nutrient transport.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.587
She has a lab
over on South Goddard.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.806
I would be breaking
about 35 federal laws

13:30.310 --> 13:31.641
if I told you that.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.305
Excuse me.

13:38.526 --> 13:42.269
Yeah, I can't
get anything to grow.
I got a total black thumb.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.361
I'm guessing she doesn't
have that problem.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.026
Uh, not so much.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.908
So, um, do you make
anything out here

13:49.037 --> 13:50.948
that might make
trees fall down?

13:51.289 --> 13:53.154
Uh, no, quite
the opposite.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.533
We study
geometrically increased
angiosperm reproduction.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.534
Huh.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.660
(GROUND RUMBLING)
(LEAVES RUSTLING)

13:59.797 --> 14:01.048
So, what's that?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.213
Accelerated tree growth.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.007
Huh.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.681
You're making
some progress.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.799
Uh-huh.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.928
Yeah, um, we were wondering
if you could take a look
at something for us.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.306
Oh, uh, wood chips
from the trees that fell.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.516
I'm actually
kind of swamped.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.688
Lateral meristems
aren't gonna reconfigure
themselves, right?

14:24.113 --> 14:26.195
l was just thinking
the same thing.

14:26.324 --> 14:29.407
But we'd love your help,
just to make sure it wasn't
caused by your department.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.777
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.239
So, where are
your uniforms?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.915
(STAMMERING) It's
an unofficial visit.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.956
So, is it true
that you guys got fired?

14:41.089 --> 14:44.206
He got fired.
l, uh, I quit.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.045
Bummer.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.846
Thanks. So, what
did you find out?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.384
I found out
you're not the sheriff.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.349
All G.D. research
is classified.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.844
I can't talk about it
to civilians.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.641
Sorry.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.309
Thank you.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.974
Yep.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.741
(EXHALES)

15:13.413 --> 15:14.493
CARTER: Topping up
the batteries?

15:14.622 --> 15:17.079
(LAUGHING) Good one.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.867
Actually,
I'm running a diagnostic
on the security system.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.790
There seems to be
some trouble with
the satellite communications.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.504
Well, when you're,
uh, unplugged,

15:25.633 --> 15:27.919
I need you to talk
to a Dr. Leonardo.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.713
Head dendrologist
for G.D.?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.464
Yeah. You're quick.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.852
I keep it all in the old
hard drive up here.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.141
Did she say anything
about all the trees
that fell last night?

15:41.274 --> 15:44.482
Uh, no, and it was the way
she didn't say anything.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.359
It's tough to explain,
man to robot.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.443
Jack...

15:48.573 --> 15:50.484
Look, it's not
an accident!

15:52.118 --> 15:54.780
I appreciate all your help,
but I can't have you
investigating.

15:54.912 --> 15:58.530
The town charter clearly
delineates my duties
as the sheriff.

15:59.542 --> 16:03.660
You see where
I'm coming from, right?
Sheriff to former sheriff?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.286
Sure.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.371
No problem.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.791
Got a lot
of packing to do.

16:09.927 --> 16:10.882
Thank you.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.879
Oh, and Jack,
don't you worry.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.630
lam on top of this.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.217
(SCREAMS)

16:29.822 --> 16:31.198
FARGO: (SIGHS)
This is really bad.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.612
They are never
gonna let me test this
top-secret robot again.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.484
Stop your whimpering, son.
Patch him up.

16:36.621 --> 16:40.739
Uh, I'm not a robot expert,
but this looks
like a dead one.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.740
Mr. Carter,
this is a secure facility,

16:42.877 --> 16:44.913
one in which you are
no longer permitted.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.871
Oh, l'mjust visiting.
I'm paying my respects.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.793
I don't think
that Andy can be fixed.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.882
This prototype was
designed for durability.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.002
I want him back
on the street asap.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.012
The town needs
a sheriff.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.343
It's notjust the trees.
We now have
a destroyed antenna dish.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.345
Yeah, somebody's
got to figure out
what's happening.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.349
Well, I don't think
that Sheriff Andy is quite
up to it at this moment.

17:07.485 --> 17:12.445
So, if someone was
gonna investigate,
Henry would be...

17:12.573 --> 17:13.779
Uh, at the site.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.694
That would be
a good place to start.
Yes.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.151
Hypothetically.
Hypothetically.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.780
HENRY: This bolt was
sheared off prior to
the dish hitting Andy.

17:21.916 --> 17:26.000
It's made of
tungsten carbide.
It holds 29 tons.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.579
Okay, so
how does a radio dish
snap like a breadstick

17:29.715 --> 17:30.830
and then crush Andy?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.878
Well, it doesn't do
either. I mean...

17:33.219 --> 17:34.550
Here, look.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.048
(LAUGHING)

17:37.431 --> 17:39.387
Someone's been
working out.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.974
This is beryllium composite,
very lightweight.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.266
I mean, something
must have ripped it
off the tower,

17:46.399 --> 17:48.230
and slammed it
onto the ground.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.853
What? Like wind?
No.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.648
We're talking
about tremendous force.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.943
I mean, equal to
100 class-5 tornadoes.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.367
Well, it's got to be
the same thing that
knocked down those trees.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.735
Let me know
if you find out
anything else.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.157
Sure. Can't stay away
from a good case, huh?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.157
I'm just
naturally curious.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.637
So, if a tree falls
in the, um...

18:20.766 --> 18:21.881
Got to go.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.508
Hi. So, what are
you doing here?

18:24.645 --> 18:26.727
Thought you said
this didn't have anything
to do with your research.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.268
I said
I can't talk to you,
and I still can't.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.770
But you want to.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.403
I mean, you want
to tell your side
of the story, right?

18:33.529 --> 18:34.735
Explain why
your stuff's here?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.775
I'm sorry,
but you're not
the sheriff, anymore.

18:36.907 --> 18:41.742
Right. I am,
and I'm very interested
to know why you're here.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.487
You're okay?
Oh, 110%.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.660
The guy
with the glasses...
Fargo.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.034
Diego. He fixed me all up,
except for a little hiccup
in the names database.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.208
Now, are you
willing to cooperate,
Dr. Leotardo?

18:53.341 --> 18:54.672
Nardo. Leonardo.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.755
Thank you, Steve.
Jack.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.170
Dr. Zhivago?

18:57.845 --> 18:58.880
Why are you here?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.178
Growing trees.

19:01.766 --> 19:05.099
| just...
I needed more space
for my experiments.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.809
This is public land.
You do realize
that it's illegal

19:07.938 --> 19:09.849
to do research
on public land,
don't you, Doctor?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.519
Yes, but I'm doing this
for the public.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.519
I grew this entire grove
in nine hours.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.486
Do you know
what lightweight,
hygroscopic hardwood

19:17.615 --> 19:18.946
could do
for the world?

19:19.075 --> 19:20.190
Yeah!

19:22.995 --> 19:23.984
No.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.739
It could reforest
entire continents,
end global warming.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.240
Until they all come
crashing down.

19:29.377 --> 19:30.867
Yeah, but
they shouldn't.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.710
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know why
the trees fell.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.670
My trees could stand up
to a hurricane.

19:36.884 --> 19:40.126
She's right, Dave.
Hygroscopic hardwood
is incredibly tough.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.342
Yeah.

19:41.472 --> 19:45.260
It'd take, uh,
100 class-5 tornadoes.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.682
Mmm! Vincent,
do you have any
Fig Newtons?

19:53.818 --> 19:55.354
Absolutely.
Coming right up.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.851
Hey! Henry,
what did you
find out?

19:56.987 --> 20:00.775
Uh, no evidence
of any force
from the outside

20:00.908 --> 20:02.739
on the trees or on
the antennae dishes,

20:02.868 --> 20:05.905
no molecular breaks,
no zero-energy scorching.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.778
So, we have no idea
what blew them down?
No.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.871
Well, whatever
knocked them down
hit them really hard.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.865
Those trees hit the ground
like a ton of

20:13.337 --> 20:14.292
trees.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.787
(CHUCKLES)
l was there.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.414
Here's your Fig Newtons.
(GASPS) Thank you
very, very much.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.041
You are very welcome.

20:20.845 --> 20:24.463
Weren't you off cookies?
Something about, uh,
10 pounds a day?

20:24.598 --> 20:27.260
Maybe the scale was off.
I don't know.
I'm 10 pounds lighter

20:27.393 --> 20:29.099
than I was yesterday.

20:30.646 --> 20:35.515
Henry, what if the trees
could get fatter,
like Lexi?

20:35.651 --> 20:36.731
Whoa. Jack.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.193
No, I mean, what if
they weren't blown down?
What if they fell

20:39.321 --> 20:40.731
because they got heavy?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.776
Well, they didn't
get fat, Jack.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.900
I mean, Iweighed
everything myself.

20:46.036 --> 20:50.075
Yeah, now, but, I mean,
what if they just got heavy
when they fell?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.368
If an extremely
lightweight object...

20:52.501 --> 20:54.708
Yeah,
like a genetically
re-jiggered tree.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.668
...experiences an
increase in weight,

20:56.797 --> 20:59.664
the sudden change
in stress could cause
catastrophic failure.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.789
And it would
fall down.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.882
But terrestrial weight
doesn't change.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.628
Gravity, for
all intents and purposes,
is a constant.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.302
Is it possible?
Is it Eureka possible?

(STAMMERING)

21:10.102 --> 21:11.091
(SIGHING)

21:11.896 --> 21:13.352
I suppose so, yeah.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.096
Andy!

21:17.443 --> 21:18.603
Hey.
What's up?

21:18.736 --> 21:22.854
I think what we've been
experiencing is
random acts of gravity.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.489
I'm still a little foggy,
but that sounds nuts.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.234
Yes, it is,
but it does explain
the antenna and the trees.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.235
Now, what we have to do
is track down
any other incidents

21:30.372 --> 21:32.658
and find out
what's causing this
before someone gets hurt.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.952
All right. I'll look into it,
but I can only go
where the evidence takes me.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.043
Great! Thanks.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.213
Anything for you, Bob!

21:47.139 --> 21:48.720
I'm okay.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.894
CARTER: Wait!
Sorry I'm late.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.733
I didn't even know
G.D. had a warehouse.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.772
So, how's Andy?

22:02.905 --> 22:06.113
Uh, Fargo's working on him.
So, uh, Henry,
why did you call us?

22:06.242 --> 22:07.357
Just a few
minutes more.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.781
I'm tracking something here,
and you need to see it.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.913
So, uh, first the radar dish,
and now his car gets stomped.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.202
Andy's had
some bad luck.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.917
Yeah, I think
it might be more
than bad luck.

22:19.046 --> 22:22.038
All right, who remembers
their M-theory physics?

22:24.009 --> 22:25.624
I'll let you
take this one.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.843
Gravity is made up
of massless particles

22:27.972 --> 22:30.714
which are distributed
equally across
the gravitational field.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.637
Correct, but my CMS scans
indicate that right now

22:33.769 --> 22:35.885
those gravitons
are actually coalescing.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.398
Wait. Are you talking
about gravity wells?

22:38.524 --> 22:40.105
What's a
gravity well?

22:40.234 --> 22:42.941
It is an area
of intense supergravity

22:43.070 --> 22:45.402
caused by the
momentary concentration
of gravitons.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.862
And they don't exist.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.903
Okay, you know what?
Stand back and watch.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.913
(SHATTERING)

23:01.964 --> 23:03.795
CARTER: Whoa!
Now, that's just
for a moment,

23:03.924 --> 23:04.879
before the gravitons
dissipate,

23:05.009 --> 23:07.170
and my scans indicate
that these gravity wells

23:07.303 --> 23:09.965
are starting to form
all over Eureka.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.551
Well, gravity wells
are one thing,

23:13.684 --> 23:16.300
but I just think that
someone is intentionally
targeting Sheriff Andy.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.802
(SPEAKING DUTCH)

23:18.397 --> 23:19.933
"Do you really think
that I was murdered?"

23:21.984 --> 23:25.602
It's Dutch.
Fargo's still repairing
his speech circuits.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.023
You speak Dutch?

23:27.156 --> 23:28.271
Carter, you said murder?

23:28.407 --> 23:31.740
Right! Yes! Um, so
we got these gravity wells
popping up all over town.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.155
There have been reports
of sinkholes,

23:34.288 --> 23:36.495
downed power lines,
fallen fences...

23:36.624 --> 23:38.660
Well, maybe
we should start thinking
about evacuation.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.955
Maybe not.
No one has been injured
except Andy,

23:42.087 --> 23:43.202
and he's been
flattened twice.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.170
I think someone
is targeting him.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.539
Well, you know what
Mansfield would say.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.051
He would say, "Of course,
you want it to be murder,

23:48.177 --> 23:49.838
"because then you'd
have to investigate it."

23:49.970 --> 23:54.634
Oh, I got a greatjob.
I got a nice office.
I got, uh, normal gravity.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.850
(SPEAKING DUTCH)

want to murder me?"

Well, lwould. I mean,
if I wanted myjob back.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.138
Me, too.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.560
lwouldn't mind

24:05.152 --> 24:06.312
No offense.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.776

24:07.905 --> 24:09.145
ALLISON: "None taken."
Yeah.

24:09.281 --> 24:13.024
All right, so what
would it take for someone
to steer a gravity well?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.946
Well, you'd have to
calibrate a tensor field

24:15.079 --> 24:17.695
specifically to
repulse gravitons,

24:17.831 --> 24:20.447
which no one has ever done,
not even come close.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.580
Well, they might be
closer than you think.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.955
CARTER: See,
a baby aquarium is
just a bad idea.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.956
HENRY: Dr. Fielding,
the gravity disturbances

24:29.093 --> 24:31.334
that have been occurring
in and around Eureka

24:31.470 --> 24:34.553
are caused by
a compact tensor field.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.469
Exactly the kind of field
created in your
birthing chamber.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.683
Interesting.
lnteresti ng?

24:42.731 --> 24:46.519
but you've stumbled
on a way to actually
control gravitons,

24:46.652 --> 24:48.734
to manipulate
the gravitational field.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.194
Dr. Fielding, it is an
incredible breakthrough,
astonishing,

24:51.323 --> 24:52.859
but it is
out of control.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.367
Well, my apologies.

24:57.037 --> 25:02.202
I suppose, if being
an accidental genius
is a crime, then, guilty.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.993
I'm sorry
if I caused any problems.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.916
You crushed
Sheriff Andy!

25:09.925 --> 25:11.711
What are you
talking about?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.835
Your gravity wells,
they crushed him.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.006
(SPEAKS DUTCH)

25:15.139 --> 25:18.097
Twice! And I don't think
it was an accident.

25:18.851 --> 25:23.140
Oh, that's insane.
I had no idea
what my field was doing,

25:23.272 --> 25:26.639
and if I wanted
to crush a sheriff,
it wouldn't be him.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.733
You know what?
We need to stop
the gravity wells

25:29.862 --> 25:31.602
before the whole town
is crushed.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.321
Look, Henry, I need you to
put a team together at G.D.,
our best people.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.408
I don't care what projects
they're working on.
This is their only priority.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.619
Great. Thanks.
Carter, bring the
good doctor back to G.D.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.534
Done.
I have a lab to tend to.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.406
Well, your lab
will have to tend
to itself.

25:44.543 --> 25:48.286
However unintentional,
your tensor field is
responsible for this problem,

25:48.422 --> 25:51.129
and right now,
you're our best option
for a solution.

25:51.258 --> 25:56.378
Right. I'll stay here,
we'll start untangling
the issues immediately.

let you know as soon as
I make any progress.

You, uh, set
the spin for two

for zero.

the gravity disturbances.

are inaccurate...

it's a basic question.

28:11.940 --> 28:12.975
Right.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.024
He doesn't know
the basics.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.362
What? Of course he does.
He built the tensor field
that started this problem.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.024
Not on his own,
he didn't.

doesn't even understand
his own machine.

from somebody who'd want
to hurt the new sheriff?

31:31.807 --> 31:33.172
Pretty much.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.924
Very devious.
I'm totally impressed.
Thank you.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.518
SARAH: Dr. Fielding's
tensor field was
quite primitive.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.057
He was unable
to see the potential.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.179
But you did.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.056
l was able to expand
on his breakthrough

31:43.193 --> 31:45.354
by cross-referencing
the Global Dynamics mainframe

31:45.487 --> 31:47.944
with a number of recently
developed theoretical models.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.109
Which you then used
to squish Sheriff Andy.

31:50.242 --> 31:54.110
I apologize. I let
my artificial emotions
get the best of me.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.783
She was desperate.
She didn't want us
to leave her here alone.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.997
Here. Fargo sent
the new scan results.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.249
Well, that doesn't
look good.

32:01.378 --> 32:04.541
Yeah, the gravitational wells
are coming together
into a single massive event.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.211
If that happens,
they will suck in any matter
that comes close.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.208
What? Like
a black hole?
HENRY: Mmm-hmm.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.002
SARAH, what
did you do?

32:12.139 --> 32:13.925
We got to move this someplace
where there's no people.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.922
lnolongerhave
graviton guidance.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.391
Dr. Fielding's
misguided attempt
at a solution

32:18.520 --> 32:20.761
made the problem grow
far beyond my control.

32:20.897 --> 32:21.932
All right, then,
it's evacuation.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.102
No, I'm afraid that
if these wells come together
into a singularity,

32:25.235 --> 32:29.069
then evacuation won't help.
The entire West Coast
will be in danger.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.405
All right, well, how about
another shot from your, um,
accelerator thingy?

32:32.534 --> 32:35.276
The field is too strong.
It's like shooting a bullet
at a asteroid.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.869
All right, well,
if a bullet won't work,
how about a bomb?

32:37.998 --> 32:39.829
That is an
interesting metaphor.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.542
A graviton pulse explosion
could return gravity
to normal.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.171
Fielding's birthing chamber.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.413
Well, you know,
if you overloaded
the tensor field,

32:47.549 --> 32:49.289
it could make
a wicked gravity bomb.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.213
It would require
a substantial external
power source.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.300
All right, you and I
get some batteries,

32:53.430 --> 32:54.510
we go to Fielding's lab,
problem solved.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.049
Uh, except
the scan indicates

32:56.183 --> 32:59.767
that the singularities
are forming on top
of Fielding's lab.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.637
That's where
the gravitational
disruption began.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.854
The gravity fluctuations
will be very intense.

33:04.983 --> 33:05.938
How intense?

33:06.067 --> 33:08.023
Birds will be
hitting the ground
like cannonballs.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.359
What we need
is, um,

33:10.405 --> 33:12.020
someone more durable.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.033
| just got him
speaking English again,

33:17.162 --> 33:19.403
and now you want
to throw him into
a giant trash compactor?

33:19.539 --> 33:22.326
He needs to connect
the power supply,
then detonate the chamber.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.792
It's gonna be
dangerous, Andy.
lwon't lie to you.

33:25.921 --> 33:29.254
This is the perfect testing
scenario for our technology.
Get him ready.

33:29.799 --> 33:30.834
No.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.171
I can't go.
Excuse me?

33:34.304 --> 33:35.544
Andy, we need you
to do this.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.671
For God's sake,
he's a machine.
He can't refuse.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.890
According to
the town charter,

33:41.019 --> 33:43.385
the sheriff is to protect
the citizenry of Eureka

33:43.522 --> 33:46.480
while avoiding
unreasonable
personal danger.

33:46.608 --> 33:50.271
In this case,
my odds of survival
would be around 7%.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.945
I got to say no.
I'm really sorry.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.825
This is an order.
I'm really sorry.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.819
Well, we have to do
something. Fargo,
what about a drone?

34:00.956 --> 34:04.574
Well, we'd have to rig it
to compensate for the change
in the gravitational field,

34:04.709 --> 34:05.960
but that would take
about 12 hours.

34:06.086 --> 34:08.452
MANSFIELD: We don't
have 12 hours.
I'll go.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.331
What? No, Carter,
Andy is right,
not with the odds at 7%.

34:12.926 --> 34:16.384
Well, around here,
that's pretty good.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.550
I've hot-wired
Fielding's tensor generator
to the engine.

34:23.687 --> 34:26.895
The repulsive field should
give you some protection
against the supergravity.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.105
All right. What happens
when I get out of the car?
You're on your own.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.390
(GROANS)
(CHUCKLES)

34:30.527 --> 34:32.142
That's the power supply.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.769
All right, so attach it
to the chamber,
set the timer...

34:33.905 --> 34:34.985
Then run.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.734
Forgot that part.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.698
You tracking
the gravitational field?

34:46.835 --> 34:47.824
Yes, ma'am.

34:47.961 --> 34:52.295
Fargo has temporarily
replaced my night vision
with magnetic sensors.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.211
If he doesn't stop
the singularity,
we'll have to evacuate.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.335
Dr. Blake,
why is he doing this?
It's not his job.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.970
(SNICKERS) It's who he is.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.387
HENRY: Jack, you should be
reaching the edge of
the gravity disturbance.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.889
Um, nothing yet.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.778
Uh, pinecones.
They sound like anvils.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.491
They probably
weigh as much.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.490
Jack, just drive.
You don't have much time.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.623
I'm at the barn.
It's pretty bad in here.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.379
Trust me.
It's gonna get worse.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.543
(GRUNTS) My legs feel
like they're 200 pounds.

35:36.676 --> 35:40.009
They probably are.
Jack, you're near the edge
of a gravity well.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.594
There's no way to predict
where they'll be.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.930
They're
forming and dissipating
all over the laboratory.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.391
Just hook in
that power supply.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.679
Got it.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.015
Here goes nothing.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.860
(GRUNTING)

36:07.624 --> 36:10.991
Uh, little problem, here.

36:14.881 --> 36:15.791
Carter?

36:15.924 --> 36:18.540
Are you sure
the battery supply is gone?
Yeah.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.713
Well, we have to find
another source of power.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.051
Little wrinkle,
I can't move.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.550
Well, you're caught
near a gravity well.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.470
Just see if you can
slide a few inches
in the right direction,

36:27.602 --> 36:28.557
and you might be free.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.642
All right.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.434
Yeah, there's no sliding.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.892
Hey, there! Need a hand?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.272
Thought you didn't
like the odds.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.106
Well, I re-ran the analysis.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.658
It seems the odds
are always a little better
when you're around.

36:45.787 --> 36:47.527
Oh, yeah,
I'm full of luck.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.623
Careful!
It's okay. Fargo
replaced my sensor.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.202
I can read the gravity fields
as they're forming.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.667
(GRUNTS)

37:00.927 --> 37:01.916
Where's the
power supply?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.629
What about that?
That's not gonna be
enough power.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.467
It might be.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.181
No, we need 10 times
household current.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.933
I've always given Fielding
these citations for tapping
too much power from the grid.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.601
It might be.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.145
All right. Let's
check it out. You follow me.

37:20.071 --> 37:20.856
(GRUNTS)

37:20.989 --> 37:24.197
You were right. This is
way over household current!
This is definitely a citation!

37:24.325 --> 37:25.405
But it is not enough.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.526
All right,
we got to boost it
with something.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.993
Yeah, me.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.950
Won't that fry you?
(DISMISSIVELY) No!

37:32.083 --> 37:34.870
Well, yeah, maybe, but
running the power from me

37:35.003 --> 37:37.164
could be just enough
to overload the field.

37:37.297 --> 37:40.004
It sure ain't gonna be fun,
but we don't have a lot
of choices right now.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.332
Or time.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.802
All right, we only have
a millisecond or two
before this thing overloads,

37:45.930 --> 37:48.797
so you need
to activate the field
at the exact same moment.

42:24.709 --> 42:25.915
Henry, what are you saying?

42:26.044 --> 42:27.124
I'm saying that there's
something out there,

42:27.253 --> 42:28.914
and it's heading
straight for us.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.329
Straight for Eureka.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.882
Morning, Sheriff.
Good morning.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.473
Deputy Lupo.
Sheriff Carter.

42:43.603 --> 42:46.936
Hey, I'm just staying
because I hate
job interviews.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.351
"What would you consider
your greatest weakness?"

42:49.484 --> 42:52.021
What kind of dumb-ass
question is that,
seriously?

42:53.071 --> 42:55.733
It's gonna happen
for you, Jo. It will.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.531
I really don't care.

42:58.659 --> 43:02.117
Yeah, you do,
and you're gonna be
a great sheriff.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.621
Damn skippy, lwill.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.078
"Damn skippy"?

43:09.212 --> 43:11.624
(BOTH LAUGHING)
