Kaori will be back tomorrow.

That's too bad.

“Art school entrance exams”

03:47.937 --> 03:49.354
“Art school entrance exams”.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.817
She studied hard in Tokyo.
Don't fall behind.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.945
We lost time because
of the move.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.780
Hello.

04:00.699 --> 04:04.493
Kaori! What a coincidence.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.996
We were just talking about you.

04:06.997 --> 04:10.959
I thought I'd drop
off my stuff today.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.671
Hi, you guys. Long time no see.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.298
Welcome back.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.007
How was the workshop?

04:19.009 --> 04:22.137
I learned a lot. I'll
fill you in later.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.763
Reiko.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.682
My shoes?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.017
Leave them on.

04:28.018 --> 04:33.147
You're all sweaty. Did
you come on your bike?

04:33.148 --> 04:36.777
Yes. That hill is a killer.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.989
This building is pretty old.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.327
Hey... Oil paints?

04:45.952 --> 04:50.122
Yes. This place used to
be a sculptor's studio.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.001
He left things behind.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.837
Now it's our classroom.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.840
Are the students in
Tokyo really good?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.469
Not like us in the countryside?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.846
Yeah but only a handful
are really talented.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.892
But planes and dimensions reflect
the artists' aesthetics.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.144
Some people are
naturally gifted.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.523
The works by students
in major prep courses

05:15.524 --> 05:17.483
are so amazing.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.527
I was impressed by

05:19.528 --> 05:23.489
how much money they
spend on the motifs.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.157
The paintings were powerful.

05:25.158 --> 05:31.080
Class has already started.
You can ask her later.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.790
About Tokyo.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.874
Yes, ma'am.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.126
Excuse me.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.212
Grime.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.006
Oh yeah.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.884
I got these at a shrine.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.677
For you.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.928
Thanks.

05:45.929 --> 05:46.929
And you.

05:50.100 --> 05:50.225

05:50.226 --> 05:51.559
“Good luck amulet”.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.019
My hands are dirty.
Leave it there.

05:55.730 --> 05:59.651
Ms. Aina, may I start today?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.152
Of course.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.488
Thank you.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.198
Can I sit here?

06:06.575 --> 06:08.410
_________“Kaori”.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.580
What?

06:12.581 --> 06:15.125
Yuka is using your clay.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.919
I'm Yuka. I just
joined the class.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.755
I didn't have any clay so...

06:21.756 --> 06:24.426
I told her she could use yours.

06:25.093 --> 06:29.346
No problem. I'll
find another batch.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.599
Thank you.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.248
Find some?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.292
Yeah.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.622
“Make a turban shell
on a platform”.

08:22.252 --> 08:26.380
This clay feels
kind of different.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.467
Hard to mold? Whose was it?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.678
Not hard to mold.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.722
Just somehow different.

08:35.472 --> 08:39.686
You've gotten good. Much
better than before.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.982
“Clay Sculpting Week”.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.818
Ten more minutes.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.214

09:11.634 --> 09:13.154
___________________________“3rd
place”

09:14.554 --> 09:16.389
“Top prize”

09:18.892 --> 09:20.852
“2nd place”.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.189
There. Your rankings.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.899
Reiko gets the top prize but.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.902
Kaori has the same score.

09:29.652 --> 09:34.324
Reiko, yours was good but similar
to one of your previous works.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.410
I know you're getting
nervous about the exams.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.371
But don't turn to
conventional designs.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.167
Stay true to your own style.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.420
Next time, be more playful.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.216
Don't worry. You
have the skills.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.515
The model is a vase
of like 200 flowers.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.849
Can you believe it?

10:00.850 --> 10:05.145
The quantity alone makes the
drawings more powerful.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.688
Who didn't return it?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.691
Oh, me. I'm sorry.

10:09.359 --> 10:14.072
I'm good with flowers so I
thought I'd be in the top 10.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.157
I overestimated myself.

10:17.158 --> 10:22.080
There are so many students.
I got 30th place.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.540
Yeah...

10:24.541 --> 10:29.420
You may be the best here but
you're probably ♪100 nationwide.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.550
I think I'm better than that.

10:38.221 --> 10:42.183
But I thought we're
actually just as good.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.311
Nobody can construct
planes like Aiko.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.143
We'll start at 9:30.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.770
Good morning.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.441
You're late. I told you
to be here at nine.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.234
Sorry.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.278
The mirror's here.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.156
Good morning.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.283
Good morning.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.163
Ouch.

13:02.824 --> 13:06.828
“Make a head sculpture of yourself
with any facial expression”.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.643
Are the students in
Tokyo really good?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.853
Do we measure up?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.814
Can we beat them?

14:08.014 --> 14:13.811
Who thinks your current skills
will get you into an art school?

14:16.522 --> 14:20.233
Nobody? You see
reality as it is.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.903
You'll all fail.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.613
You want to come
back here next year?

14:24.614 --> 14:27.657
Repeat the same projects?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.494
No higher aspirations?

14:29.911 --> 14:32.789
You're up against a
lot of competition.

14:33.623 --> 14:37.375
I'll evaluate your works
at noon tomorrow.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.419
They're hopeless at the moment.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.840
Lock up after yourselves.
Don't stay past nine.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.194
I'm leaving soon.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.155
I'm in a hurry.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.377
Reiko, see you tomorrow.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.671
Bye.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.818
You fed it before you left.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.487
Yes.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.489
Did you close the door?

17:12.323 --> 17:14.992
I thought I did.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.311
What happened? This is awful.

17:49.902 --> 17:54.615
You should tell Ms. Aina.
You don't deserve this.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.287
It's okay. I'm fine.

18:00.621 --> 18:04.542
I'm definitely more
motivated now.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.450
They're better now.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.454
Kaori gets the top
prize and that's it.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.456
Aiko, Kanji, Reiko.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.126
Yours won't get you
into art school.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.171
Look at Yuka's sculpture.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.840
She's a beginner and
isn't very good yet.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.012
But the judges may choose
this for its novelty.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.598
The rest are all mediocre.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.687
What should I do?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.314
What?

19:08.647 --> 19:10.733
How can I improve?

19:13.361 --> 19:15.780
Study fine works of art

19:16.113 --> 19:18.990
and practice as
much as possible.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.577
What kind of fine works?

19:23.162 --> 19:27.499
Like this sculpture by Kaori
and previous works by Reiko.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.501
Also by my former students.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.087
That won't help.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.673
Well, I only have four
former students...

19:35.674 --> 19:37.968
It's better to search online.

19:38.761 --> 19:43.098
It's a fact. We live
in the countryside.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.101
There are only five of us.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.020
Remember yesterday?

19:49.438 --> 19:54.401
You said there's a lot of competition.
We have to check them out.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.529
Make it protrude more.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.782
Ms. Aina.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.828
Is the quality of classes
in Tokyo that much better?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.247
The answer is clear.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.499
Kaori studied in Tokyo.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.085
I think it was the clay.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.839
I started this course
after Kaori but

20:15.840 --> 20:19.009
I thought I was just
as good as her.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.096
But it's apparent now.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.015
Tokyo made the difference.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.519
Kaori has definitely
improved her skills.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.314
But will going to Tokyo
do that for everybody?

20:33.315 --> 20:36.443
Students there don't get
as much attention...

20:36.444 --> 20:41.239
Ms. Aina, I think the
clay I used was unusual.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.490
Wait.

20:42.491 --> 20:47.413
I believe an artist's basic training
is what matters in the end.

20:48.038 --> 20:52.250
Regardless where you're from,
with solid basic skills

20:52.251 --> 20:56.004
and strong determination,
you'll pass the exam.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.841
If the choice comes
down to two people

20:59.842 --> 21:02.094
it's their style
that gets judged.

21:02.344 --> 21:06.389
Students in big courses have
more sources of inspiration

21:06.390 --> 21:08.976
which gives them an advantage.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.493
“Aina”

21:33.167 --> 21:36.128
“Aina Academy _New
students wanted”.

21:37.004 --> 21:42.176
Can't you invite an instructor
from Tokyo once a month?

21:44.553 --> 21:46.430
You're all we have.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.350
If we can learn from
other instructors...

21:50.351 --> 21:52.685
If you have time to complain

21:52.686 --> 21:55.105
use it for more
practice projects.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.732
Move your hands if
you want to improve.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.111
I know how you feel but
work with what you have.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.659
Earthquake!

22:22.091 --> 22:23.509
Are you guys okay?

22:29.306 --> 22:30.683
You're right.

22:31.642 --> 22:32.852
I get it.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.855
Let me think about it.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.358
I disagree.

22:39.984 --> 22:44.822
I don't want to lose my
individuality to convention.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.658
The countryside has
its advantages.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.327
So I'm fine as we are.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.831
I'll lock up again tonight.

23:30.618 --> 23:31.744
I disagree.

24:34.515 --> 24:35.515
What's happening?!

24:56.203 --> 25:00.666
Someone, help me!

25:36.660 --> 25:38.037
Help!

26:22.706 --> 26:24.249
It's hot!

28:24.661 --> 28:25.662
What?

28:28.123 --> 28:29.206
I...

28:29.207 --> 28:31.001
How could Reiko do this?

28:32.169 --> 28:34.338
This is too much.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.509
I know she doesn't like me.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.510
No...

28:41.511 --> 28:43.262
But wrecking my sculpture?

28:43.263 --> 28:45.973
I was alone last night...

28:45.974 --> 28:48.351
Putting a blade in the clay...

28:48.352 --> 28:49.311
Blade?

28:49.312 --> 28:50.645
Are you serious?

28:50.646 --> 28:52.439
I didn't do that.

28:53.023 --> 28:56.317
Sure, I was jealous of you.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.904
But I wouldn't do
anything like that.

28:59.154 --> 29:03.282
Last night after you all left,
the clay started moving.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.117
Your sculpture started moving...

29:05.118 --> 29:07.787
What's the use of harassing me?

29:07.788 --> 29:11.708
You may not believe me but
I'm telling you the truth!

29:12.125 --> 29:14.503
I can't get through to her.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.505
Maybe she's home.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.341
I got her answering machine.
Her mom's also gone.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.968
Who are you talking about?

29:21.969 --> 29:23.345
I hope she's okay.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.183
Good morning.

29:28.642 --> 29:31.018
What's up? Is there a problem?

29:31.019 --> 29:33.437
I'm going to Reiko's house.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.148
Will you clean this place up?

29:36.149 --> 29:39.987
You're talking about me?
Wait! Ms Aina!

29:41.822 --> 29:44.408
Wait! Ms. Aina!

29:44.992 --> 29:46.785
Hey! Hold on!

29:47.244 --> 29:48.412
Wait!

29:51.540 --> 29:54.626
What is it? What happened?

29:57.713 --> 29:59.047
Someone!

30:01.174 --> 30:04.928
Kaori! I'm right here!

30:05.220 --> 30:06.220
No!

31:34.935 --> 31:38.480
Why do we have to
clean up after her?

31:39.815 --> 31:43.818
She's too proud. Look at
the trouble she made.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.612
I wish she'd quit.

31:47.280 --> 31:51.200
Reiko is desperate to
please her parents.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.662
We're all desperate.

31:55.455 --> 32:01.002
We're classmates but in the
end, we're also enemies.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.171
Come on...

32:04.589 --> 32:07.049
I want us all to get accepted.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.344
It's such a small prep class.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.687
I made you a boxed lunch.

32:21.398 --> 32:24.818
Oh... But I bought one today.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.404
Sorry.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.156
I have to wash up.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.231
Reiko! We were all
worried about you.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.804
I'll help you look.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.849
It's all right. Keep working.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.022
Yuka's not back yet?

34:39.661 --> 34:42.705
Yuka, where were you?

34:42.706 --> 34:44.666
Come back inside.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.059
Sorry.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.148
Where were you?

35:08.898 --> 35:11.317
Your cell phone was ringing.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.318
Reiko?

35:12.319 --> 35:13.986
The art supply shop.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.655
Okay. Thanks.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.369
You okay?

35:23.288 --> 35:26.833
You made lunch for
me today, right?

35:27.834 --> 35:29.669
You promised.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.845
Isn't that your bag?

35:40.096 --> 35:45.185
You shouldn't leave it there.
Although no one will steal it.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.023
I'm going inside before
they get suspicious.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.651
I'm looking forward to lunch.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.809
Lunch?

36:26.810 --> 36:29.187
You brought yours, right?

36:31.898 --> 36:34.775
Not today. I'll go with you.

36:34.776 --> 36:35.819
Okay.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.164
Is this the lunch you made me?

36:50.542 --> 36:53.420
It'll get dirty on the floor.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.508
Thanks. So sweet of you.

36:58.967 --> 37:03.680
Let's eat together over there.
We're alone now.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.613
Let's eat.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.206
Ew. What's this?

38:12.207 --> 38:15.667
It must've gone bad because
you left it outside.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.504
It tastes like clay.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.007
Ow!

38:24.886 --> 38:29.682
I was kidding. It
doesn't taste that bad.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.773
What are you doing?

38:37.065 --> 38:39.734
Hey...

38:44.864 --> 38:47.534
Good morning, Reiko.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.134
Oops.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.180
What happened?

39:11.015 --> 39:12.933
I'll go get something.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.018
Thanks.

39:25.947 --> 39:26.990
What?

40:43.358 --> 40:44.484
Aiko?

40:50.490 --> 40:52.158
Where are you?

40:53.493 --> 40:54.535
Watch out!

40:54.911 --> 40:57.330
Kanji's acting weird!
He's over there!

40:58.164 --> 41:00.333
What happened? What?

41:03.002 --> 41:04.671
Kanji?

41:05.880 --> 41:07.173
What's going on?

42:26.502 --> 42:27.502
Help!

42:27.503 --> 42:29.047
What are you doing?!

42:37.430 --> 42:40.266
No, Kanji!

42:45.438 --> 42:46.606
Stop!

43:28.397 --> 43:29.397
Come here!

44:39.468 --> 44:40.468
Move!

44:44.974 --> 44:47.226
Get up! Hurry!

46:13.604 --> 46:17.942
Mitazuka was a
struggling sculptor.

46:19.068 --> 46:21.987
During the day, he worked at

46:21.988 --> 46:26.283
an industrial waste factory
and made sculptures at night.

46:28.077 --> 46:33.164
He exhibited his works at
art galleries in Tokyo

46:33.165 --> 46:36.460
but they received poor reviews.

46:36.919 --> 46:39.921
He didn't have
good social skills

46:39.922 --> 46:44.301
and started having problems
with the gallery owners.

46:45.803 --> 46:49.807
His bad reputation
grew in the industry

46:50.099 --> 46:54.645
and people became wary of him.

46:55.980 --> 47:01.777
One day, he ran into a classmate

47:02.820 --> 47:05.781
from his art school prep class.

47:07.116 --> 47:11.620
The man had given up
art years earlier

47:12.496 --> 47:18.627
and had become a huge success
in the restaurant business.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.798
Fascinating.

47:26.093 --> 47:27.970
They're great.

47:29.430 --> 47:34.310
There are many restaurants and
boutiques that'd love them.

47:34.810 --> 47:37.395
They'll definitely sell.

47:37.396 --> 47:40.690
Why don't you make
them yourself?

47:40.691 --> 47:45.112
I can't. I haven't touched
clay in close to 20 years.

47:46.489 --> 47:49.450
Plus, I don't have the talent.

47:50.493 --> 47:53.788
I'll ask around as
soon as I get back.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.210
In any case

48:00.586 --> 48:03.631
you should go see
a dermatologist.

48:17.645 --> 48:22.024
“Tokyo, here I come. I'm
going to make it big.”

48:30.866 --> 48:35.621
After that, Mitazuka started
making sculptures like crazy.

48:50.719 --> 48:55.307
But they didn't
attract any buyers.

48:56.559 --> 48:57.977
Then one day.

48:58.477 --> 49:03.065
Mitazuka became ill
for unknown reasons.

49:05.151 --> 49:10.447
It was probably because of
illegal chemical waste products.

49:12.324 --> 49:17.288
When he realized he was dying,
he made his final sculpture.

49:18.164 --> 49:22.459
A humanoid statue,
which he named Kakame.

49:22.835 --> 49:27.463
Kakame, you're going
to Tokyo in my place.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.544
You're my alter ego. 326A
00492521/00492705 My child.

49:31.135 --> 49:36.389
I'm going to die but you'll live.
You'll stay alive forever.

49:36.390 --> 49:41.812
Even after my physical death,
I'll stay alive in you.

49:42.062 --> 49:45.649
And the world will
come to praise me.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.745
You'll keep living.

49:58.746 --> 50:01.624
I'll be Minoru Mitazuka,
the famous sculptor.

50:02.082 --> 50:08.088
The world will praise the
man who created art here.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.051
50,000 yen?

50:16.597 --> 50:18.348
Take this for now.

50:18.349 --> 50:22.685
You've got to be kidding.
What happened to the profits?

50:22.686 --> 50:23.853
I want the money!

50:23.854 --> 50:27.273
Actually, people had
bought his sculptures.

50:27.274 --> 50:33.821
The man had cheated him and used
the money to pay off his debt.

50:33.822 --> 50:37.033
His business had been
deteriorating for few years

50:37.034 --> 50:40.703
and he was knee deep in debt.

50:40.704 --> 50:45.125
I'm doing the best I can. I
just need a little time.

50:46.168 --> 50:48.294
I'll pay you soon.

50:48.295 --> 50:49.338
Soon?

50:50.714 --> 50:54.008
That's too late. I
don't have time.

50:54.009 --> 50:55.135
Let go of me!

50:56.887 --> 50:58.264
Get your hands off me!

51:05.521 --> 51:06.814
Ouch!

51:09.233 --> 51:10.651
Bastard!

51:16.740 --> 51:17.741
Mitazuka!

51:18.826 --> 51:21.120
Mitazuka! Hey!

51:21.829 --> 51:23.949
Mitazuka... 2015a 00513714/00513902
＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿“Police”.

52:15.007 --> 52:20.511
Mitazuka's disease had
eaten away at his bones.

52:20.512 --> 52:22.848
They turned to powder.

52:58.592 --> 52:59.968
Hot!

53:08.685 --> 53:12.940
The man returned from time
to time to pay his respects

53:13.649 --> 53:17.027
to the deceased with
his favorite drink.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.448
Nobody even remembered
Mitazuka's existence.

53:22.741 --> 53:26.286
Until this moment today.

53:39.174 --> 53:40.801
That story...

53:42.177 --> 53:43.637
You made it up.

53:45.556 --> 53:46.807
Clay?

53:47.599 --> 53:50.935
Integrates into human
bones and attacks people?

53:50.936 --> 53:52.146
Why?

53:52.688 --> 53:57.693
We were just studying
to get into art school.

53:59.653 --> 54:00.946
So why?

54:04.241 --> 54:05.284
Why did this happen?

54:05.743 --> 54:08.454
I'm going to the police.

54:09.371 --> 54:11.832
I want all of this to end.

54:13.208 --> 54:15.294
It's my fault.

54:18.714 --> 54:21.300
If I hadn't dug up the bag...

54:26.013 --> 54:28.640
Let's go to the police.

54:30.434 --> 54:32.144
We'll tell them everything.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.530
It's the last batch.

55:24.821 --> 55:28.283
I'll finish up. You
two, get ready.

55:28.700 --> 55:31.620
Kaori, please lock up.

56:15.414 --> 56:16.914
We're ready to go.

56:16.915 --> 56:19.459
Okay. So am I.

56:19.793 --> 56:21.128
Where's Kaori?

56:25.048 --> 56:26.300
Kaori?

56:52.326 --> 56:53.326
No...

57:19.895 --> 57:20.979
Kaori!

57:27.986 --> 57:31.949
Kaori... Why?

57:35.744 --> 57:39.289
We were gonna go to
school together in Tokyo.

57:40.248 --> 57:41.291
Why?

57:42.167 --> 57:43.460
Why?

57:47.547 --> 57:48.674
No!

58:41.852 --> 58:43.061
Open it.

59:00.787 --> 59:01.830
Move.

59:08.628 --> 59:12.090
It's all your fault for killing Mr.
Mitazuka.

59:12.841 --> 59:16.511
It's why everybody is dead.

59:17.345 --> 59:20.015
You killed all my friends.

59:45.999 --> 59:46.999
Ms. Aina!

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.961
Leave the kids alone.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.174
That's enough.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.177
Mitazuka...

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.022
“Tokyo Academy of Arts”

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:16.175
“Modeling clay”

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:56.591
“Many successful applicants”

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:11.773
“23 applicants accepted
into Tokyo Art College”.

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:33.187
Our next story.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:37.524
The police announced today
that DNA analysis revealed

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:40.610
the identity of the male corpse
found in Yamaoka prefecture

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:44.865
at Aina Academy, a prep
school for the arts

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:48.911
as a local man named
Kyozo Fushimi, age 58.

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:54.041
The police suspect that
Fushimi was involved

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:58.003
in some sort of foul
play at the academy

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:01.381
and are currently searching
the whereabouts of

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:05.261
the academy's director
and five students.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:06.172
It's concrete. Someone
was here first.

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.757
Just dump the stuff already.

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:12.805
Let me know if anyone shows up.
