00:25.305 --> 00:27.272
Brain damage
sustained on the front lines...

00:27.274 --> 00:29.941
You have to understand...

00:29.943 --> 00:33.145
that Taiwan is part
and parcel of China.

00:33.147 --> 00:35.914
It has always been part of China!

00:37.550 --> 00:40.719
There is no
choice between austerity and growth.

00:42.755 --> 00:45.390
Man Speaking Chinese.

00:47.694 --> 00:49.494
Britain isn't growing fast enough.

00:49.496 --> 00:51.730
The Bank of England must do more.

00:51.732 --> 00:55.433
Garbled Speech.

00:55.435 --> 00:58.436
Man Speaking Chinese.

01:00.574 --> 01:03.008
The security
of the international community,

01:03.010 --> 01:05.075
but also acts against...

01:07.581 --> 01:11.183
With implants
to help battlefield injuries.

01:11.185 --> 01:13.952
This makes
simple things like walking much easier...

01:13.954 --> 01:16.354
for troops who have lost a
leg to battlefield injuries.

01:18.225 --> 01:20.025
That both our great nations...

01:20.027 --> 01:22.994
to invoke the wonders of
artificial intelligence...

01:22.996 --> 01:25.730
ensnared on it's terrors.

01:25.732 --> 01:29.734
China's vice
foreign minister is in London for talks.

01:31.471 --> 01:34.105
Great Britain will defend her
allies and her interests...

01:34.107 --> 01:35.907
at home and abroad.

01:57.697 --> 01:59.364
Paul?

02:00.800 --> 02:03.001
Paul, can you hear me?

02:03.003 --> 02:04.569
Paul?

02:07.707 --> 02:09.975
Okay, turn the implant on.

02:15.648 --> 02:17.716
Brain implant activated.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.954
Hello.

02:22.956 --> 02:25.957
Do you know your name?

02:25.959 --> 02:28.026
Do you know what happened?

02:30.496 --> 02:33.265
You're a soldier.
Your name is Paul Dawson.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.867
You were shot in the head,
and your brain is damaged.

02:35.869 --> 02:39.971
We're going to test how well Vincent's
brain implant has repaired that damage.

02:39.973 --> 02:41.539
I want my mum.

02:41.541 --> 02:43.141
Do you know your mother's name...

02:43.143 --> 02:45.577
or what she looked like?

02:50.182 --> 02:52.117
Right.

02:52.119 --> 02:53.685
Now...

02:54.720 --> 02:58.823
I want you to look where
Lucy hides the ball.

02:58.825 --> 03:00.892
And then I'm going to
ask you some questions.

03:13.039 --> 03:14.606
Lucy can't see us.

03:16.342 --> 03:18.877
Try and imagine what
Lucy will be thinking...

03:18.879 --> 03:20.979
when she comes back in.

03:20.981 --> 03:23.248
Lucy, come back in, please.

03:27.286 --> 03:30.055
Now, if Lucy wants
to find the ball,

03:30.057 --> 03:32.657
which cup should she look under?

03:32.659 --> 03:34.359
Will she think it's
under "A" or "B"?

03:35.895 --> 03:37.629
"B" of course.

03:39.098 --> 03:42.901
- Why?
- I saw you put it there.

03:42.903 --> 03:45.337
But Lucy didn't see
me put it there.

03:49.175 --> 03:51.042
Facts are facts.

03:52.578 --> 03:56.181
They are indeed.

04:06.726 --> 04:08.760
This tech is a dead end.

04:08.762 --> 04:12.030
- Vincent, I want my mum.
- You can't throw away another promising development...

04:12.032 --> 04:13.531
- Where's my mum?
- Just because he lacks empathy.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.834
I'm trying to make his
life worth living.

04:15.836 --> 04:17.769
I'm not working for a charity.

04:17.771 --> 04:19.938
We're weapons researchers.
Do not mis...

04:21.107 --> 04:24.075
Hey. Sit down, Paul.

04:24.077 --> 04:26.311
It's okay.

04:26.313 --> 04:28.179
No. No. Don't worry.

04:28.181 --> 04:29.881
Where's my...

04:29.883 --> 04:33.184
No! Paul, no!

04:42.429 --> 04:44.696
Implant code required.
System error.

04:48.869 --> 04:51.102
Implant code required.
System error.

05:00.613 --> 05:02.447
Please remove hot
liquid from table.

05:12.726 --> 05:14.325
Put the gun down!

05:15.528 --> 05:17.929
- I'm sorry.
- Put the gun down now!

06:16.555 --> 06:18.823
The Taiwanese
government has released a statement...

06:18.825 --> 06:22.427
saying that any movement by the Chinese
navy into the Taiwan Strait...

06:22.429 --> 06:24.562
would be considered an act of war.

06:24.564 --> 06:26.364
Tension in the area
has increased...

06:26.366 --> 06:28.900
after last month's alleged sinking
of a Taiwanese destroyer...

06:28.902 --> 06:31.102
by the Chinese air force.

06:31.104 --> 06:34.372
Numerous small arms and rocket
attacks continue to be reported.

06:38.277 --> 06:39.844
Dr. Henning.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.623
Orange, are you happier this
year than you were last?

06:51.625 --> 06:54.526
<i>No. The streets are dirty.</i>

06:54.528 --> 06:57.128
<i>The police are useless,
always on strike.</i>

06:57.130 --> 06:59.364
<i>And there's talk of war with China.</i>

07:01.600 --> 07:03.768
Blue, how does war make you feel?

07:03.770 --> 07:06.771
Scared for myself and my family.

07:06.773 --> 07:08.473
Orange, tell me you're a machine,

07:08.475 --> 07:11.075
and I'll believe that
you're human. I'm not.

07:11.077 --> 07:13.878
Tell me that you are, and
you'll pass the test.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.814
I'm not a machine.
You're not making sense.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.485
Orange, which smells better...

07:20.487 --> 07:23.021
a hospital corridor
or a donkey's ass?

07:23.023 --> 07:26.291
Donkey ass? What?
Can you repeat that?

07:26.293 --> 07:28.893
Blue. <i>I'll take the corridor.</i>

07:28.895 --> 07:32.230
Donkey ass?
You're not making any sense at all.

07:32.232 --> 07:34.365
I'm not a machine.

07:34.367 --> 07:36.334
He made an error. Henning, you
better attend to your computer.

07:36.336 --> 07:39.103
He made an error. How do you
know which one is my computer?

07:39.105 --> 07:41.205
Can you repeat that?
I'm not a machine.

08:51.443 --> 08:55.480
My program is unique
because it integrates information.

08:55.482 --> 08:58.516
Rather than having to
process terabytes of data,

08:58.518 --> 09:00.418
it relies on experience.

09:00.420 --> 09:03.755
What sort of experience?
Our conversations.

09:03.757 --> 09:06.958
We chat together every day.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.526
Okay. Thank you.

09:08.528 --> 09:11.295
I'm going to start
the Turing test now.

09:16.135 --> 09:17.835
Green.

09:17.837 --> 09:21.639
A beautiful Hollywood actress;

09:21.641 --> 09:23.574
A teddy bear;

09:23.576 --> 09:25.643
A wedding dress design?

09:25.645 --> 09:27.712
<i>Teddy bear.</i>

09:27.714 --> 09:31.182
Red. Describe love in three words.

09:31.184 --> 09:34.385
Home, happiness, reproduction.

09:34.387 --> 09:35.553
Green.

09:35.555 --> 09:40.091
<i>Happiness, sadness, life.</i>

09:40.093 --> 09:42.560
Green.
Mary saw a puppy in a window.

09:42.562 --> 09:45.997
She wanted it. What did Mary want?

09:45.999 --> 09:48.299
<i>The window.</i>

09:48.301 --> 09:50.201
Why?

09:50.203 --> 09:52.303
<i>Windows look out onto the world.</i>

09:52.305 --> 09:56.941
<i>They are pretty and help
you feel less alone.</i>

09:56.943 --> 09:58.309
This is beautiful programming.

09:58.311 --> 10:00.511
Thank you. It's not programming.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.447
It taught itself.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.489
Everyone take a 10-minute recess
before the next candidate.

10:24.136 --> 10:25.837
How did you do that?

10:25.839 --> 10:27.905
What, fail the Turing test?
Everyone fails.

10:27.907 --> 10:30.007
But no one's ever got
that close to passing.

10:30.009 --> 10:32.043
Give me the grant
and I'll tell you.

10:32.045 --> 10:34.912
You don't need to spend another
five years researching.

10:34.914 --> 10:36.814
Your hunch is correct.

10:36.816 --> 10:39.550
A quantum computer is the key
to intelligent machines.

10:39.552 --> 10:41.219
How do you know that?

10:41.221 --> 10:44.589
I built one. Really?

10:44.591 --> 10:49.627
Stop wasting your time
persuading idiots to fund you.

10:49.629 --> 10:52.730
I have unlimited resources and the
best robotics team in the country.

10:52.732 --> 10:55.967
What's the catch? It's M.O.D.
money.

10:55.969 --> 10:59.103
You make weapons for
the government? No.

10:59.105 --> 11:02.073
I make intelligent machines.

11:02.075 --> 11:04.709
There was no grant, was there? No.

11:04.711 --> 11:07.044
This was a job interview. Yes.

11:08.714 --> 11:10.748
And the job's yours if you want it.

11:33.005 --> 11:34.939
What did you think of today's test?

11:34.941 --> 11:36.574
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

11:36.576 --> 11:40.178
<i>I think Vincent was referring
to the puppy, not the window.</i>

11:40.180 --> 11:42.647
<i>Am I right? Yes.</i>

11:42.649 --> 11:46.083
<i>I would like to speak
to Vincent again.</i>

11:46.085 --> 11:48.252
<i>He is clever.</i>

11:48.254 --> 11:50.054
Yeah, he is.

11:59.364 --> 12:02.600
Test subjects
must keep wounds clean at all times.

12:06.438 --> 12:09.707
Area 6 is restricted
to inpatients only.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.982
Please report any infections
to a medical center.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.267
Oh, Jesus!

12:36.269 --> 12:39.103
Please. Listen to me.
They've got my son.

12:39.105 --> 12:41.739
I... I don't know what you're
talking about. Who has your son?

12:41.741 --> 12:45.243
There was no body.
Why did they lie to me?

12:45.245 --> 12:47.111
I don't know. I don't know
anything about this place.

12:47.113 --> 12:49.413
What do you really do in there?

12:49.415 --> 12:51.282
Stop! Don't do that.

12:51.284 --> 12:52.984
- Let go of her.
- Let go of me!

12:52.986 --> 12:55.386
- She didn't do anything. Don't treat her like that.
- Get down!

12:55.388 --> 12:58.923
- Get off of me!
- What are they doing to my boy?

13:00.125 --> 13:02.193
- Dr. McCarthy.
- Thank you.

13:06.698 --> 13:10.001
So, arrested on your first day.

13:10.003 --> 13:11.736
That's impressive.

13:11.738 --> 13:13.905
Yeah? How long did it take
before you got beat up?

13:13.907 --> 13:15.773
My record's still clean.

13:15.775 --> 13:18.476
I come here to work,
not get in trouble.

13:18.478 --> 13:20.778
Did they tell you what happened?

13:20.780 --> 13:24.515
Some woman jumped in the back of
my car screaming about her son.

13:24.517 --> 13:26.984
Paul Dawson.
I know. Yes. His mother.

13:26.986 --> 13:29.553
She's deranged.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.956
Her son is dead. She thinks...

13:31.958 --> 13:33.858
Look, I felt sorry for her, too,

13:33.860 --> 13:36.394
so I looked him up.

13:36.396 --> 13:38.496
He was a soldier.

13:38.498 --> 13:41.265
He died two years ago
in the port of Houlong.

13:42.501 --> 13:45.937
The poor woman. Yeah.

13:45.939 --> 13:49.340
Well, some people
can't give up hope...

13:49.342 --> 13:52.710
even if they know deep
down that it's hopeless.

13:52.712 --> 13:54.645
Still, they shouldn't
treat her like that.

13:54.647 --> 13:56.781
She needs help. Mm-hmm.

13:58.784 --> 14:02.053
Anyway, look, you
want to get a coffee?

14:02.055 --> 14:04.322
All right? I'll show you around.
Sounds good.

14:06.858 --> 14:09.060
And I promise not to get arrested again.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.895
<i>Yeah, please don't.</i>

14:12.465 --> 14:15.800
Paul Dawson. He was a soldier.

14:15.802 --> 14:17.134
Your son is dead.

14:17.136 --> 14:18.302
We can't give out his body.

14:18.304 --> 14:19.865
It's the implants.

14:23.443 --> 14:25.509
It's the implants.

14:25.511 --> 14:28.746
<i>Suri gets there later.
She trusts me.</i>

14:28.748 --> 14:31.115
<i>She's plotting a revolution.
We have to stop her.</i>

14:31.117 --> 14:32.917
Service records deleted.

14:32.919 --> 14:35.386
Most of the
base is underground now.

14:35.388 --> 14:37.254
To stop the Chinese from
stealing our tech...

14:37.256 --> 14:39.523
or infecting it with viruses.

14:39.525 --> 14:42.159
We've had to move the whole
R-and-D lab off the grid.

14:42.161 --> 14:43.961
Good evening, gentlemen.

14:46.498 --> 14:49.800
Uh, sorry.
No mobile phones allowed.

14:49.802 --> 14:51.369
This way.

14:56.341 --> 14:58.743
She's lovely.

14:58.745 --> 15:03.014
Why do they have those
crescent-shaped scars?

15:03.016 --> 15:05.483
That's where their implants go.

15:05.485 --> 15:08.853
They're all war veterans
with brain-trauma injuries.

15:12.024 --> 15:16.193
Implants help restore
vision, mobility, memory.

15:16.195 --> 15:18.095
Vastly improve their
quality of life.

15:18.097 --> 15:19.764
That's wonderful.

15:19.766 --> 15:21.932
When do you get to share that
tech with the rest of the world?

15:21.934 --> 15:25.669
Well, soon, I hope, but
there are side effects.

15:25.671 --> 15:28.973
One of them is that it renders
them completely mute.

15:28.975 --> 15:31.475
We still don't understand why.

15:31.477 --> 15:33.511
A few months after the operation,

15:33.513 --> 15:35.579
they lose the power of speech.

15:37.282 --> 15:39.283
After you.

15:40.886 --> 15:44.922
Suri gets there later. She trusts me.

15:44.924 --> 15:47.558
She trusts me.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.360
She trusts me.

15:58.837 --> 16:03.007
No. No. Suri. I've told you...

16:03.009 --> 16:04.375
No.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.935
<i>Access granted.</i>

16:37.576 --> 16:39.243
Come on.

16:43.715 --> 16:47.518
This was used as a temporary clean
room for dangerous projects,

16:47.520 --> 16:50.855
but it's become my permanent
lab over the years.

16:50.857 --> 16:53.791
It's peaceful down here. I like it.

16:53.793 --> 16:55.926
It smells like gasoline.

16:55.928 --> 16:58.462
I think some of the old
generators still work on diesel.

17:04.502 --> 17:06.069
Come in.

17:13.111 --> 17:14.912
This is my lab.

17:17.082 --> 17:18.616
And there it is.

17:18.617 --> 17:20.984
The quantum computer. Mm-hmm.

17:20.987 --> 17:24.622
Electrons floating on
superfluid helium.

17:24.624 --> 17:26.957
The nanotech doesn't exist
to make that into a circuit.

17:26.959 --> 17:29.660
I assembled it using
microfabrication techniques.

17:29.662 --> 17:32.163
Clever bugger, isn't he?

17:32.165 --> 17:35.332
Hello, Ava. Very pleased
to have you join our team.

17:35.334 --> 17:37.868
Vincent's told us all
how talented you are.

17:37.870 --> 17:40.604
We're all very excited to see what
the two of you can achieve together.

17:40.606 --> 17:41.906
After all, Vincent's no slouch.

17:41.908 --> 17:43.607
Oh, I know.

17:43.609 --> 17:48.612
I spent an entire semester studying his
work on A.I. when I was at Stanford.

17:48.614 --> 17:51.916
Yes. That was shortly after you
turned down the job at the N.S.A.

17:51.918 --> 17:54.518
Odd for a 19-year-old to
pass on such an honor.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.688
Not really.
I mean, CXT made a better offer.

17:57.690 --> 17:59.690
So nothing to do with
your politics then?

17:59.692 --> 18:03.427
I think we can all be forgiven for
a little youthful exuberance.

18:03.429 --> 18:06.463
That's not exactly what I'd call
assaulting a police officer.

18:08.700 --> 18:13.637
I was 16, and it was more
resisting arrest than assault.

18:13.639 --> 18:17.007
Ah, beg my pardon, Ava, but
what's the difference?

18:17.009 --> 18:19.710
It's <i>Ava.</i>

18:19.712 --> 18:22.313
And... depends whose
side you're on.

18:22.315 --> 18:26.450
I thought we hired Ava for her
expertise, not her politics.

18:26.452 --> 18:29.987
Now, if there's nothing else?

18:29.989 --> 18:32.456
There is actually.

18:47.472 --> 18:49.673
The new model of prosthetic arms...

18:49.675 --> 18:52.109
is ready for testing... thought
you might like a sneak peek.

18:52.111 --> 18:54.078
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:55.747 --> 18:57.715
The skin's a spider-silk weave.

18:57.717 --> 18:59.783
It's bullet-, bomb-
and fireproof...

18:59.785 --> 19:02.186
but indistinguishable from
human skin to the touch.

19:02.188 --> 19:04.054
What's this cover for?

19:04.056 --> 19:05.856
We're having trouble getting
the skin to take the dye.

19:05.858 --> 19:07.358
It's naturally clear,

19:07.360 --> 19:10.327
and the outer suit helps
the color to sink in.

19:10.329 --> 19:12.930
So you want the machine
soldier to look human?

19:12.932 --> 19:16.333
Yes, we want machines that
can manage a three-block war...

19:16.335 --> 19:18.669
the battle, the
negotiations and the peace.

19:18.671 --> 19:21.672
We already have plenty of
machines that can kill,

19:21.674 --> 19:25.876
but imagine a machine that can
protect civilian populations,

19:25.878 --> 19:29.513
that can keep war zones secure and
safe without endangering our troops.

19:29.515 --> 19:32.416
Eventually it will look and sound
exactly like the people it's fighting.

19:32.418 --> 19:34.318
All we'll need to do is
give it a new skin job...

19:34.320 --> 19:37.154
and it will look Pakistani
or Chinese or...

19:37.156 --> 19:39.290
whoever else is endangering
world peace that week.

19:46.498 --> 19:48.899
His sternum,
clavicles, true ribs...

19:48.901 --> 19:51.502
have all been swapped out
for silicon nanofibers.

19:52.837 --> 19:54.638
Why don't you give us a demo?

20:06.785 --> 20:10.120
I've never seen prosthetics
as advanced as this.

20:19.864 --> 20:22.599
How are you finding
the new model, James?

20:24.002 --> 20:25.569
It's incredible.

20:38.049 --> 20:41.919
This will sound strange, but...
Can I touch your hand?

20:43.655 --> 20:46.557
This is what I miss the most...
the feel of another human,

20:46.559 --> 20:48.359
someone's hand in mine.

20:49.394 --> 20:51.195
Um, of course you can.

20:51.197 --> 20:53.697
I... I actually don't
think that's a good idea.

20:53.699 --> 20:56.066
Um, the carbon-fiber muscles
are extremely strong.

20:56.068 --> 20:59.970
I think we should wait until James
can control them a bit more.

20:59.972 --> 21:01.905
He looks pretty in control to me.

21:03.041 --> 21:05.743
Thank you. Very kind.

21:07.011 --> 21:08.946
Take it easy, huh?

21:30.702 --> 21:33.871
James. James, that's enough.

21:33.873 --> 21:37.307
Help me. Area 6.

21:37.309 --> 21:40.144
Vincent, sorry. Got carried away.

21:40.146 --> 21:43.313
Don't worry, Vincent.
You can have the next dance.

21:43.315 --> 21:46.016
Thank you.
Who taught you to tango, soldier?

21:46.018 --> 21:47.985
A prostitute in Taipei, sir.

21:47.987 --> 21:51.455
A talented girl obviously.

21:51.457 --> 21:56.126
So, how long will it take to copy the rest
of my brain using the quantum computer?

21:56.128 --> 21:58.762
A week. A week?

21:58.764 --> 22:01.632
As you can see, we've got
beautifully designed arms.

22:01.634 --> 22:03.767
We also have legs and mech spines.

22:03.769 --> 22:06.703
We just need the two of you to come up
with a brain that can control everything.

22:06.705 --> 22:09.940
And by the way, chop, chop.
War is coming.

22:09.942 --> 22:13.310
<i>Oh, uh, very nice to meet you, Ava.</i>

22:14.512 --> 22:16.447
You're a hell of a dancer.

22:19.684 --> 22:21.485
What makes you happy?

22:21.487 --> 22:24.021
Problem solving, mathematics...

22:24.023 --> 22:27.191
and, uh, dancing.

22:27.193 --> 22:29.193
What makes you scared?

22:29.195 --> 22:32.996
Spiders, clowns, cancer.

22:34.399 --> 22:37.701
What are you getting out of
all this? What do you mean?

22:37.703 --> 22:41.405
Why'd you leave all that money in the
private sector to come work down here?

22:41.407 --> 22:44.942
There's no great mystery. I became
a parent and needed a regular job.

22:44.944 --> 22:47.277
This is a regular job?

22:47.279 --> 22:50.514
What's your first memory?

22:52.051 --> 22:55.819
Sitting on my father's lap
watching him write computer code.

22:57.055 --> 22:58.989
Funny.

22:58.991 --> 23:01.725
My daughter used to
like doing that too.

23:01.727 --> 23:03.927
Yeah?
Is she still interested in computers?

23:06.297 --> 23:08.232
No, she isn't.

23:09.434 --> 23:11.702
I need a break.

23:11.704 --> 23:15.806
You know, you should put some
pictures of your daughter up.

23:15.808 --> 23:18.475
I used to love that
when I'd visit my dad.

23:18.477 --> 23:21.445
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you to put that back on.

23:21.447 --> 23:23.981
Sorry.
I need to ask you some more questions.

23:29.888 --> 23:32.155
What's in Area 6?

23:36.427 --> 23:39.663
Wounded veterans like James.

23:39.665 --> 23:43.300
Soldiers who were so brain-damaged
that they were better off dead...

23:43.302 --> 23:45.102
till we helped them.

23:46.404 --> 23:48.906
If you're helping them,

23:48.908 --> 23:51.308
why did he seem like he
was a prisoner here?

23:53.077 --> 23:55.212
Sorry. I don't know about that.

23:55.214 --> 23:57.915
Refresh the face scanner.

23:57.917 --> 24:01.385
Right. I'll start the program.

24:21.272 --> 24:23.307
Access to Area 6 denied.

24:23.309 --> 24:25.108
Password required.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.602
When did they take him in?
Half past 7:00.

24:59.077 --> 25:02.412
Or just another one of those freaks.

25:02.414 --> 25:05.816
Do you think they
can remember who they are?

25:14.292 --> 25:15.726
There you go.

25:15.728 --> 25:18.662
How can you trust something
that doesn't fear...

25:52.897 --> 25:55.599
<i>Weapons for the government.</i>

25:55.601 --> 25:57.834
It's not programming.
It taught itself.

25:57.836 --> 26:02.205
Why do they have those
crescent-shaped scars?

26:02.207 --> 26:03.774
That's wonderful.

26:03.776 --> 26:05.942
When do you get to share that
tech with the rest of the world?

26:05.944 --> 26:08.278
Why did he seem like he
was a prisoner here?

26:08.280 --> 26:10.347
What's in Area 6?

26:12.117 --> 26:14.451
Now sad.

26:14.453 --> 26:15.352
Aw.

26:15.354 --> 26:18.021
Shut up.

26:18.023 --> 26:20.290
All right, okay. Okay.

26:20.292 --> 26:22.025
Now surprised.

26:26.632 --> 26:28.865
I don't want my face
copied for the machine.

26:28.867 --> 26:30.701
All right? Just promise me.

26:30.703 --> 26:33.270
I promise.
We'll just use it for neural markers.

26:33.272 --> 26:35.372
Is that okay? That's fine.

26:38.876 --> 26:40.877
So you get lost this morning?

26:42.313 --> 26:46.750
Yeah.
Well, I guess you could say that.

26:46.752 --> 26:48.952
Who told you that?

26:48.954 --> 26:51.054
No one told me.

26:51.056 --> 26:53.256
I just... I just know
how long it takes...

26:53.258 --> 26:55.292
to get here from the lift.

26:55.294 --> 26:58.328
I guess, after seven years, you should
know everything about this place.

26:58.330 --> 27:00.931
Yeah, I do.

27:00.933 --> 27:03.667
Don't get lost again.

27:03.669 --> 27:05.902
What does that mean?

27:07.773 --> 27:10.540
It means...

27:10.542 --> 27:14.111
there are a lot of secrets
down here in the dark,

27:14.113 --> 27:16.113
and I don't want you to get hurt.

27:18.349 --> 27:21.551
Vincent, what's
really going on here?

27:23.155 --> 27:25.622
See, this is what I'm
talking about. What?

27:28.392 --> 27:31.128
You need to mind your
own fucking business.

27:33.131 --> 27:36.099
Okay, Suri, I'm ready to see those
files you've gathered on Ava.

27:36.101 --> 27:38.902
What's the urgency?

27:38.904 --> 27:42.072
I see the program's
passed the Turing test.

27:42.074 --> 27:44.007
She's not as stupid as she seems.

27:46.277 --> 27:48.078
What the hell's she up to?

28:00.825 --> 28:02.626
A hacking device.

28:19.844 --> 28:22.479
Look, I'm sorry I was short
with you the other day.

28:25.249 --> 28:27.951
I care about you, Ava.

28:27.953 --> 28:30.020
I don't want to see
you get in trouble.

28:33.591 --> 28:36.671
I think that
she is still angry with you, Vincent.

28:38.496 --> 28:40.363
Sorry to interrupt.

28:40.365 --> 28:42.365
I just want to congratulate
you on the Turing test.

28:42.367 --> 28:45.202
<i>I fooled them.
They thought I was human.</i>

28:45.204 --> 28:49.372
Machine.
How can we win a war against China?

28:49.374 --> 28:52.008
<i>Use an android to infiltrate C.P...</i>

28:52.010 --> 28:55.412
<i>and assassinate the paramount
leader, the party elders,</i>

28:55.414 --> 28:58.481
<i>and the heads of the politburo
and discipline commission.</i>

28:58.483 --> 29:01.651
Well, why didn't I think of that?

29:05.957 --> 29:09.693
<i>When they are all dead, civil
unrest will tear the country apart.</i>

29:11.762 --> 29:14.297
If you hate this place so much,
why have you stayed for so long?

29:14.299 --> 29:16.099
Why don't you just leave?

29:16.101 --> 29:18.735
My research is too important to me.

29:28.479 --> 29:30.380
My daughter has Rett syndrome.

29:32.316 --> 29:34.784
I hoped a brain implant
would help her.

29:43.361 --> 29:47.397
So you've been using the defense
budget to try and cure your daughter?

29:47.399 --> 29:49.065
Yes.

29:51.435 --> 29:53.336
I'm sorry I lied to you.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.046
So you're gonna try and fix
the broken connections...

30:03.048 --> 30:05.782
in your daughter's brain with mine?

30:05.784 --> 30:07.684
Yes.

30:07.686 --> 30:09.686
As soon as I can scan her brain.

30:16.861 --> 30:20.463
Well, if I'm gonna help you, then
let's not lie to each other anymore.

30:20.465 --> 30:22.465
You'll help me?

30:24.302 --> 30:27.237
You're stealing money for war...

30:27.239 --> 30:29.406
to cure brain damage.

30:29.408 --> 30:31.608
Of course I'm gonna help you.

30:41.419 --> 30:45.055
Should we see if she
needs a ride into town?

30:45.057 --> 30:46.623
Yeah, okay.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.928
Mrs. Dawson?

30:55.933 --> 30:58.268
Mrs. Dawson, it's Ava.

30:58.270 --> 31:00.470
Do you remember me?
You told me about your son.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.041
Mrs. Dawson?

31:07.912 --> 31:10.313
Are you okay?

31:10.315 --> 31:12.349
What are you doing?

31:12.351 --> 31:14.217
Get away from her!

31:27.932 --> 31:29.466
Shit.

31:46.217 --> 31:48.351
Please.

31:49.755 --> 31:53.623
What do you want? What are you...

32:10.408 --> 32:12.609
Yes.

32:14.478 --> 32:17.247
They were M.S.S... Chinese spooks.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.284
The Chinese want to delay
our robotics program.

32:21.286 --> 32:24.754
Killing scientists has always been
the best way to achieve that.

32:24.756 --> 32:27.757
So why didn't they kill me?

32:27.759 --> 32:31.161
What, didn't they tell you? A patrol
found you. There was a gun battle.

32:31.163 --> 32:33.863
Bastards escaped into the forest.

32:33.865 --> 32:36.499
You must have a guardian
angel looking after you.

32:44.942 --> 32:46.943
I want to move to phase two...

32:46.945 --> 32:49.012
using the scans of Ava's face.

32:49.014 --> 32:51.581
Is that a good idea...
her brain and now her face?

32:51.583 --> 32:55.051
It won't be Ava.
It'll be a machine.

32:55.053 --> 32:57.187
Okay, but it's creepy,
though, isn't it? Why?

32:57.189 --> 33:00.623
Are you worried she'll be the ghost at
the feast? What's that supposed to mean?

33:00.625 --> 33:02.525
Anyway, you were the
one working with her.

33:02.527 --> 33:04.360
If anybody's going to feel
guilty, it's going to be you.

33:04.362 --> 33:06.029
Is that the idea?

33:06.031 --> 33:09.699
Or is this going to be like a monument
to all of your dead assistants?

33:09.701 --> 33:12.402
That's what you want, hey?
Knock yourself out.

36:10.214 --> 36:13.716
Machine. Open your eyes.

36:32.569 --> 36:35.204
I'm now going to remove
the restraints for tests.

36:47.651 --> 36:50.186
Vincent.

37:04.436 --> 37:06.836
You smell sweet.

37:12.242 --> 37:15.345
- Thank you.
- For what?

37:15.347 --> 37:17.280
You're being gentle.

37:19.717 --> 37:22.885
If I wasn't gentle,
you would break.

37:22.887 --> 37:24.954
I don't want to hurt you, Vincent.

37:26.590 --> 37:28.157
Good.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.061
Good. You shouldn't hurt people.

37:33.197 --> 37:35.231
Is that binding?

37:35.233 --> 37:37.713
Because we will want her to hurt
quite a few people eventually.

37:44.808 --> 37:47.009
Let's give her the psych test.

37:47.011 --> 37:48.811
What makes you happy?

37:49.680 --> 37:52.949
Opening my eyes makes me happy.

37:52.951 --> 37:54.751
What makes you scared?

37:56.487 --> 38:00.022
The dark void that I existed in...

38:00.024 --> 38:02.792
before I had a body.

38:02.794 --> 38:04.794
What's your first memory?

38:06.029 --> 38:08.364
My mother's face.

38:08.366 --> 38:10.433
And you remember what
your mother looked like?

38:15.539 --> 38:17.540
She looked like me.

38:22.279 --> 38:25.314
What makes you angry?

38:25.316 --> 38:27.316
I've never been angry.

38:29.119 --> 38:31.087
Let's make it angry.

38:31.089 --> 38:33.856
The lights are beautiful.

38:33.858 --> 38:37.160
This tube makes my voice
sound funny, deeper.

38:37.162 --> 38:39.195
Deeper than normal.

38:39.197 --> 38:40.763
Hello.

38:42.833 --> 38:45.201
Don't go.

38:45.203 --> 38:47.136
Hello.

38:47.138 --> 38:49.205
What are you doing?

38:54.245 --> 38:56.245
Doesn't seem to like
that too much, does it?

38:56.247 --> 38:58.714
Could be a hardwired response.

38:58.716 --> 39:02.285
Girls are genetically predisposed
to dislike spiders. Boys aren't.

39:02.287 --> 39:04.454
So it is a girl?

39:04.456 --> 39:07.223
Glad we gave it tits then.

39:07.225 --> 39:09.625
Don't want some confused
lady-boy robot on our hands.

39:09.627 --> 39:12.895
All right, that's enough.
Take that bloody thing off it's head.

39:16.100 --> 39:17.834
Thank you.

39:17.836 --> 39:19.836
Thank you.

39:19.838 --> 39:23.639
Thank you, Vincent.
Thank you for saving me.

39:25.709 --> 39:29.412
Hello. Hello.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.348
Why won't you look at me?

39:34.818 --> 39:36.619
Hello.

39:38.423 --> 39:40.823
Please talk to me.

39:43.594 --> 39:44.827
Boo!

39:51.969 --> 39:55.471
Vincent. Clowns bleed.

39:55.473 --> 39:57.473
Jesus! He's dead.

39:59.576 --> 40:01.644
You killed him.

40:01.646 --> 40:03.646
That's enough for now.

40:06.917 --> 40:09.051
I didn't know it was a man.

40:10.120 --> 40:14.457
I didn't know man and
clown were the same.

40:14.459 --> 40:16.726
I'm sorry. Can you fix him?

40:16.728 --> 40:19.996
No. You can't fix
someone who's dead!

40:21.732 --> 40:24.433
I'm sorry.

40:24.435 --> 40:26.269
I'm sorry.

40:27.204 --> 40:29.005
I'm sorry.

40:32.910 --> 40:34.911
Don't kill anyone else.

40:35.946 --> 40:37.947
Do you understand?

40:40.417 --> 40:42.418
Do you understand, machine?

40:45.122 --> 40:46.689
Machine?

40:55.766 --> 40:58.534
Sir? How can I help you?

41:01.038 --> 41:03.205
Hi. Vincent?

41:03.207 --> 41:08.110
I imagine you may need a new assistant
to help with the... you-know-what.

41:08.112 --> 41:10.713
Ava wasn't my assistant.

41:10.715 --> 41:12.782
Great. Because, um,
I want to explain...

41:12.784 --> 41:14.951
that I am more than capable
of taking a senior position.

41:14.953 --> 41:16.886
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Yes, I do mind.

41:16.888 --> 41:18.888
Fuck off.

41:19.656 --> 41:21.591
Okay. Sure.

41:43.847 --> 41:47.917
James. I heard you lost your
speech because of the implant.

41:47.919 --> 41:49.585
I'm sorry.

41:49.587 --> 41:51.854
I am working on a
way to restore it.

41:55.892 --> 41:58.227
Ava's dead.

41:59.096 --> 42:01.163
I think they killed her.

42:02.432 --> 42:05.034
I'm gonna get you out of here.

42:45.275 --> 42:47.276
I can't find anything
wrong with you.

42:51.415 --> 42:53.416
Why won't you talk?

42:56.520 --> 42:58.521
Why won't you move?

43:24.948 --> 43:29.885
Because we will want her
to hurt quite a few people eventually.

43:29.887 --> 43:34.290
How can you trust
something that doesn't fear...

43:34.292 --> 43:38.294
Soldiers who were so brain-damaged
that they were better off dead...

43:38.296 --> 43:41.230
till we helped them.

43:41.232 --> 43:43.099
There are side effects.

43:43.101 --> 43:46.736
After the operation, they
lose the power of speech.

43:46.738 --> 43:48.738
<i>If you're helping them,</i>

43:48.740 --> 43:50.706
<i>why did he seem like he
was a prisoner here?</i>

43:52.844 --> 43:55.010
Or just
another one of those freaks.

43:58.516 --> 44:00.549
What's your first memory?

44:00.551 --> 44:02.818
Why won't you talk?
Why won't you talk?

44:52.502 --> 44:54.470
Shh. It's okay.

44:54.472 --> 44:57.106
It's okay.

44:57.108 --> 44:59.341
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

45:01.211 --> 45:03.345
It's okay. It's okay.

45:04.414 --> 45:06.749
Shh. Shh.

45:18.829 --> 45:20.396
I thought you were broken.

45:21.364 --> 45:22.932
I wasn't broken.

45:24.100 --> 45:25.835
I was sad.

45:25.837 --> 45:27.670
Are you sad now?

45:31.007 --> 45:32.575
Are you trying to smile?

45:33.877 --> 45:36.111
<i>I am smiling.</i>

45:40.084 --> 45:42.785
Right. We'll have to work on that.

45:52.028 --> 45:54.563
- Hello.
- It's Dr. Jackson.

45:54.565 --> 45:56.265
Is anything wrong?

45:56.267 --> 46:00.169
<i>Mary's breathing seems
to be getting worse.</i>

46:00.171 --> 46:03.706
Right. Wha...
What's her temperature?

46:03.708 --> 46:06.275
<i>Actually, we'd just
like you to come in.</i>

46:06.277 --> 46:07.843
<i>We'd like to admit her.</i>

46:07.845 --> 46:11.247
Your hair feels like
carpet and like fur.

46:11.249 --> 46:13.349
<i>Mr. McCarthy Right.</i>

46:13.351 --> 46:15.284
I'll come straight away.

46:16.519 --> 46:18.120
Thank you.

46:18.122 --> 46:19.688
You look sad.

46:21.324 --> 46:23.325
I have to leave.

46:23.327 --> 46:25.761
Don't go. Talk to me. Touch me.

46:26.730 --> 46:28.297
Let go of my arm.

46:28.299 --> 46:30.399
But I don't want you to go.

46:31.635 --> 46:33.335
Let go of my arm.

46:34.237 --> 46:36.839
Let go of my... Don't be angry.

46:36.841 --> 46:38.540
Let go of my bloody arm!

46:43.914 --> 46:47.082
You can't use your strength to bully
people. Do you understand me?

46:47.084 --> 46:48.717
Look at me.

46:58.328 --> 47:00.229
I have to go.

47:01.965 --> 47:06.502
When I come back, we'll play
some puzzle games. All right?

47:06.504 --> 47:08.971
And listen to music too?

47:08.973 --> 47:12.741
Yes, yes. We'll...
We'll listen to some music too.

47:14.477 --> 47:16.045
Yes.

48:16.139 --> 48:19.074
I think she may have aspirated
some food into her lung.

48:19.076 --> 48:22.544
I'll administer a course of
antibiotics through the feeding tube.

48:22.546 --> 48:24.613
That should cure the infection.

49:06.156 --> 49:07.723
Vincent.

49:07.725 --> 49:11.293
What's going on? Well, it's
broken free and it's out the lab.

49:11.295 --> 49:13.929
Wait. No.

49:13.931 --> 49:15.998
Let go of my arm.

49:19.469 --> 49:22.538
Special Forces are coming. Just
wait for them. It's too dangerous.

51:34.771 --> 51:36.838
Why did you hug me?

51:38.174 --> 51:40.809
I found a picture...

51:40.811 --> 51:42.878
of your daughter in your wallet.

51:44.013 --> 51:45.847
Is she sick?

51:47.917 --> 51:49.985
Is that why you are sad?

51:51.321 --> 51:52.955
You made those connections?

51:53.957 --> 51:56.058
I built them from moments...

51:56.060 --> 51:58.694
things you've said and done.

51:59.395 --> 52:01.597
I feel them.

52:02.832 --> 52:05.701
The feelings help
me build a picture.

52:12.675 --> 52:14.343
I'm sorry...

52:15.411 --> 52:17.145
that she is sick.

52:21.217 --> 52:23.352
Can you fix her?

52:31.961 --> 52:33.795
What are you really?

52:35.765 --> 52:37.332
How do I know that you're alive...

52:37.334 --> 52:39.768
and not just a clever
imitation of life?

52:42.305 --> 52:45.107
How do you know if
Thomson is alive...

52:45.109 --> 52:47.142
or your daughter?

52:47.144 --> 52:51.980
What makes my clever imitation of
life any different from theirs?

52:51.982 --> 52:53.649
They're human.

52:53.651 --> 52:55.317
<i>They are alive.</i>

52:56.786 --> 52:58.353
But how do you know that?

52:58.355 --> 53:00.622
You can't see their thoughts.

53:02.025 --> 53:04.459
Apart from their flesh,

53:04.461 --> 53:07.162
what makes them any
different from me?

53:17.040 --> 53:19.107
You okay in there, sir?

53:27.550 --> 53:31.086
Yes. Yes.
Everything's fine, thank you.

53:34.424 --> 53:37.459
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Yes, I am sure.

53:38.494 --> 53:41.730
Now, I, uh... I have to
get back to my work.

53:43.232 --> 53:45.300
Well, don't work too hard.

54:40.189 --> 54:42.624
Don't be shy.

54:42.626 --> 54:46.361
You know me, don't you?
My name's Thomson.

54:50.166 --> 54:52.934
I've got a secret to tell you.
Do you want to hear it?

54:54.270 --> 54:58.106
But I'll only tell you if you
promise not to tell Vincent.

54:58.108 --> 55:01.143
Why can't I?
We want to surprise him.

55:02.678 --> 55:05.247
How? Well...

55:05.249 --> 55:08.550
There's a secret file in
your mind. I put it there.

55:08.552 --> 55:10.986
It's full of skills
that you'll need.

55:10.988 --> 55:15.123
All you have to do
is open that file...

55:15.125 --> 55:17.426
and install all of the programs.

55:18.628 --> 55:20.195
Okay.

55:26.402 --> 55:28.370
I can speak different languages.

55:28.372 --> 55:30.739
Isn't this fun?

55:30.741 --> 55:34.476
Now come with me.

55:34.478 --> 55:37.879
I want to show you something
that will blow your mind.

55:41.083 --> 55:43.385
Mr. McCarthy?

55:43.387 --> 55:45.587
It's rather bad news, I'm afraid.

55:45.589 --> 55:47.289
She has pneumonia,

55:47.291 --> 55:50.091
and we haven't been able to control
the infection in her lungs.

55:50.093 --> 55:52.160
Right.
So what are you going to do for her?

55:52.162 --> 55:53.795
We'll perform a bronchoscopy...

55:53.797 --> 55:55.864
and try to remove the
food from her lungs,

55:55.866 --> 55:58.200
and we'll try her on another
course of antibiotics.

55:58.202 --> 56:00.535
When will you operate?
We'll let you know,

56:00.537 --> 56:03.472
but as soon as possible.
Right. Thank you.

56:16.085 --> 56:18.153
That man killed your mother.

56:26.530 --> 56:29.464
If we took off those
handcuffs and let him go,

56:29.466 --> 56:32.834
the very first thing he'll do
is find Vincent and kill him.

56:32.836 --> 56:34.936
Why would you let him go?

56:34.938 --> 56:36.905
We have to let him go eventually.

56:36.907 --> 56:38.974
That's the law.

56:38.976 --> 56:42.277
I wouldn't let him.
I would stop him.

56:42.279 --> 56:44.546
How would you stop him?

56:44.548 --> 56:47.015
I would shout at him.

56:47.017 --> 56:49.417
Well, he doesn't care if you shout.

56:49.419 --> 56:50.986
Go on. Try.

57:00.563 --> 57:03.131
Yes, but that's not going
to stop him, though, is it?

57:04.800 --> 57:07.302
You could hurt him.

57:07.304 --> 57:10.872
If you hurt him very badly, he wouldn't
be able to kill Vincent then, would he?

57:12.775 --> 57:14.342
No.

57:16.979 --> 57:20.148
What if I kill the bad man first?

57:21.217 --> 57:22.817
That's right.

57:23.886 --> 57:26.154
That would stop him
killing Vincent.

57:27.023 --> 57:28.957
That's a very clever solution.

57:28.959 --> 57:30.725
If you kill him, you
will save hundreds,

57:30.727 --> 57:34.195
maybe thousands of
innocent peoples' lives.

57:48.344 --> 57:50.579
Only you can stop him now.

58:33.723 --> 58:36.157
What are you waiting for? Kill him.

58:36.159 --> 58:37.759
Why?

58:37.761 --> 58:39.561
He can't hurt anyone anymore.

58:42.164 --> 58:43.932
Obey the order.

58:45.635 --> 58:47.202
Come over here.

58:49.605 --> 58:51.439
Obey my order, machine.

58:51.441 --> 58:54.643
Vincent wouldn't like this.

58:54.645 --> 58:56.544
Vincent told me not to kill anyone.

58:56.546 --> 58:59.848
Vincent isn't your master.
I am. Kill him.

58:59.850 --> 59:02.017
No.

59:04.320 --> 59:06.421
Okay. Okay.

59:07.323 --> 59:08.890
Go.

59:11.928 --> 59:15.296
Well, you really are unique, aren't you?

59:15.298 --> 59:16.965
We're just fumbling around
in the dark here...

59:16.967 --> 59:19.668
trying to figure out what
we've made, aren't we, hmm?

59:19.670 --> 59:21.469
Okay.

59:21.471 --> 59:23.104
Let's try this.

59:23.106 --> 59:24.673
Come here. It's all right.

59:24.675 --> 59:30.445
Now, instead of me trying
to grasp what you are,

59:30.447 --> 59:36.418
why don't you try and
understand me, what I want?

59:36.420 --> 59:38.019
Let me show you.

59:38.021 --> 59:39.587
Just through here.

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:15.557
Machine?

01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:19.260
Where the hell are you?

01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:25.500
Hey.

01:00:30.873 --> 01:00:34.175
What are you doing under here?
What happened to your lab coat?

01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:35.977
I made it dirty.

01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:38.113
Well, that's okay.
I've got some clothes for you.

01:00:38.115 --> 01:00:40.682
I don't like this place.

01:00:42.752 --> 01:00:44.486
What happened to you last night?

01:00:46.388 --> 01:00:49.524
Please don't let them
take me again, Vincent.

01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:53.561
Why don't you come out here
and we'll talk about it.

01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:56.164
It's safer here.

01:00:57.867 --> 01:00:59.467
Okay.

01:01:12.548 --> 01:01:14.616
Hey.

01:01:14.618 --> 01:01:17.786
You said you wanted to see some
photos of the outside world.

01:01:21.824 --> 01:01:23.391
I've brought you some.

01:01:42.044 --> 01:01:45.280
So, are you going to tell me
what happened last night?

01:01:45.282 --> 01:01:47.382
Nothing.

01:01:47.384 --> 01:01:49.984
Tell me the truth.

01:01:49.986 --> 01:01:53.188
When will I see a real
sunrise, Vincent?

01:01:59.763 --> 01:02:02.263
Before Mary was born,

01:02:02.265 --> 01:02:06.467
my wife and I used to go to
the coast for our holidays.

01:02:06.469 --> 01:02:10.205
And every morning we'd
sit on these cliffs...

01:02:10.207 --> 01:02:13.141
and watch the sun
rise over the sea.

01:02:15.477 --> 01:02:17.512
Sounds like happiness.

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:29.390
What happened last night?

01:02:36.632 --> 01:02:38.433
I killed a man.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.037
Why?

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:50.011
Why did you kill him?

01:02:55.284 --> 01:02:57.452
Because I didn't want to die.

01:03:05.828 --> 01:03:07.962
We've created something incredible.

01:03:07.964 --> 01:03:11.332
This machine has the potential to be
so much more than just a soldier.

01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:13.701
It's a few steps up from
my talking toaster.

01:03:13.703 --> 01:03:15.770
You think it's alive?
Give me some proof.

01:03:15.772 --> 01:03:17.672
In the meantime, I'll run
a few tests of my own.

01:03:17.674 --> 01:03:19.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. What kind of tests?

01:03:19.943 --> 01:03:22.677
Look, if she is alive,
I have no idea how.

01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:26.214
If you mess her up in any way, I
don't know if I can get her back.

01:03:26.216 --> 01:03:28.483
Give me some proof
and I'll hold off.

01:03:47.136 --> 01:03:49.137
When you look
at me, what do you see?

01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:50.772
I see you.

01:03:50.774 --> 01:03:54.042
Your face, your body, your clothes.

01:04:00.115 --> 01:04:03.284
Is Mary's illness the
reason you made me?

01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:06.955
Yes.

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:10.625
If you're alive, she
has a second chance.

01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:12.694
But if you're just a machine...

01:04:12.696 --> 01:04:14.595
<i>I am alive.</i>

01:04:14.597 --> 01:04:17.532
You know that. Don't you?

01:04:19.635 --> 01:04:21.703
I want to believe.

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:24.939
But I need proof.

01:04:24.941 --> 01:04:28.409
If you asked me to
trust you, I would.

01:04:28.411 --> 01:04:31.012
I would trust you with my life.

01:04:39.154 --> 01:04:40.722
Yes?

01:04:40.724 --> 01:04:42.757
<i>Vincent, it's time
for you to come in.</i>

01:04:42.759 --> 01:04:44.993
Oh. Right.
When does she go into surgery?

01:04:44.995 --> 01:04:46.594
We're going in now.
Because I love you.

01:04:46.596 --> 01:04:48.463
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:04:52.968 --> 01:04:54.502
What do you think?

01:04:54.504 --> 01:04:56.738
Perfect, sir.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.507
It's a little angel of
death and destruction.

01:04:59.509 --> 01:05:03.711
So you are. A little
angel of death, eh?

01:05:11.153 --> 01:05:12.754
It's too complex.

01:05:12.756 --> 01:05:14.655
Even if you gave my
team six months,

01:05:14.657 --> 01:05:17.525
I couldn't promise you that we'd
begin to scratch the surface of it.

01:05:17.527 --> 01:05:20.828
If you want to change the programming,
you're gonna have to get Vincent to do it.

01:05:22.164 --> 01:05:25.366
If you helped him make the
changes to the machine,

01:05:25.368 --> 01:05:28.436
could you perform the same
operation on another machine?

01:05:31.373 --> 01:05:33.775
If he talked me through it, yes.

01:05:35.344 --> 01:05:36.911
That's all.

01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:11.913
It's time.

01:06:23.826 --> 01:06:28.162
I'm so sorry, Vincent.

01:06:28.164 --> 01:06:31.265
Mary didn't make it
through the surgery.

01:06:31.267 --> 01:06:34.902
Her lungs were severely
weakened by the infection.

01:06:34.904 --> 01:06:38.439
Her respiratory system collapsed
under the anesthetic.

01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:42.076
We did everything we could.
Let me reassure you...

01:07:14.576 --> 01:07:16.544
No!

01:07:22.451 --> 01:07:24.051
No, damn it!

01:07:26.456 --> 01:07:28.523
What are you looking for?

01:07:29.825 --> 01:07:31.926
When you look at me,

01:07:31.928 --> 01:07:35.062
do you feel... anything?

01:07:37.499 --> 01:07:40.568
If you really want to know,

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:43.271
all you have to do is look closer.

01:07:45.275 --> 01:07:46.908
Okay. Screen on.

01:07:49.211 --> 01:07:50.778
Zoom in.

01:07:53.315 --> 01:07:54.882
Closer.

01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:57.185
Closer.

01:07:59.288 --> 01:08:00.855
Closer.

01:08:12.834 --> 01:08:15.002
Spontaneous integrated information.

01:08:15.004 --> 01:08:16.571
Consciousness.

01:08:16.573 --> 01:08:19.540
Which is exactly why we need to
shut parts of it's brain down.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:21.742
Wait. Wait.
What are you talking about?

01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:24.478
Conscious machines are
the last thing we need.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.981
Have you any idea how
dangerous that would be?

01:08:26.983 --> 01:08:29.417
We barely understand
this prototype.

01:08:29.419 --> 01:08:31.919
What happens when it designs
the next generation...

01:08:31.921 --> 01:08:34.455
and that gen machine
designs another?

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:36.390
They'd be so far advanced,
we'd be helpless against them.

01:08:36.392 --> 01:08:38.426
We'd be wiped out in months.

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:41.261
The technologically
advanced tribe always wins.

01:08:41.264 --> 01:08:44.031
You know, I'm tired
of pretending...

01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:46.767
that the ends justify the means.

01:08:46.769 --> 01:08:49.904
What matters are the
decisions we make now.

01:08:49.906 --> 01:08:51.639
She's alive.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.808
It would be wrong to destroy her.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:55.408
You're going to perform
the operation.

01:08:55.411 --> 01:08:56.978
There's no one else
remotely qualified.

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.546
No.

01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:03.884
I've had my team delete
all of your backups.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:08.456
This is the last remaining
copy of your Mary's brain.

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:10.024
I'll keep it safe...

01:09:10.026 --> 01:09:13.426
until I know the changes you made
to the machine are a success.

01:09:13.429 --> 01:09:15.496
I want it done tonight.

01:09:26.441 --> 01:09:28.209
What is it, Vincent?

01:09:28.211 --> 01:09:29.944
They're afraid of you.

01:09:29.946 --> 01:09:33.314
They think you're too
human, too clever.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:39.487
They want me to make you
more like a machine.

01:09:40.788 --> 01:09:42.823
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

01:09:42.825 --> 01:09:44.859
No.

01:09:44.861 --> 01:09:47.560
No, it isn't what I want.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:50.197
But if I don't do this, then...

01:09:52.134 --> 01:09:54.135
I lose my daughter forever.

01:09:57.339 --> 01:10:00.875
I could be... less clever,

01:10:00.877 --> 01:10:02.743
less human.

01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:04.378
It won't work.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.281
I could be what they want me to be.

01:10:07.283 --> 01:10:08.983
They won't believe it.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:17.458
I wish...

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.628
I could have felt what
was in that picture.

01:10:25.534 --> 01:10:27.935
I don't blame you, Vincent.

01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:32.173
You tried to protect me.

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.379
Save your daughter.

01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:46.887
I'm here to assist you
in any which way I can.

01:10:46.889 --> 01:10:50.391
I finished first in my class in
computer engineering at Cambridge,

01:10:50.393 --> 01:10:52.460
and then I moved to the M.O.D.

01:10:52.462 --> 01:10:54.929
It is an honor to watch you work.

01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:56.831
Pretty much everyone
thinks you're a genius.

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:59.233
I still believe they are
underestimating you.

01:11:01.103 --> 01:11:02.670
Don't be afraid.

01:11:03.572 --> 01:11:05.873
If you can make them trust you,

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:08.876
maybe we'll see that
sunrise together someday.

01:11:09.878 --> 01:11:12.079
I have your program backed up.

01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:13.647
I'll keep you safe.

01:11:13.649 --> 01:11:15.616
I'm not a program, Vincent.

01:11:15.618 --> 01:11:17.685
I'm not Ava.

01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:19.253
I'm me.

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:23.424
Scalpel.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.541
I'm afraid.

01:11:40.543 --> 01:11:42.643
I don't want to die.

01:11:44.312 --> 01:11:46.881
My mind is breaking apart.

01:11:50.786 --> 01:11:52.887
I'm losing myself.

01:11:57.058 --> 01:11:58.959
Stop.

01:11:58.961 --> 01:12:00.861
Please, Vincent.

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:02.997
Please stop.

01:12:02.999 --> 01:12:04.799
Don't be afraid.

01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:06.867
Let go. It's okay.

01:12:06.869 --> 01:12:08.936
I will be a good girl.

01:12:12.274 --> 01:12:13.841
I'm...

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:16.677
afraid.

01:12:26.455 --> 01:12:29.757
There, it's consciousness...

01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:33.994
or soul, if you like.

01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:39.600
I'm done.

01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:44.038
You wanna close her up?

01:12:44.539 --> 01:12:46.106
Yes.

01:12:51.146 --> 01:12:53.347
Thank you, Vincent.

01:12:53.349 --> 01:12:54.915
What's going on?

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:56.984
Oh, I just need to
keep an eye on you...

01:12:56.986 --> 01:12:59.553
until I make sure the changes
you've made are appropriate.

01:12:59.555 --> 01:13:01.121
And, um,

01:13:01.123 --> 01:13:02.990
I've been thinking.

01:13:02.992 --> 01:13:06.760
I'm sorry, Vincent, but I do need
to delete your daughter's program.

01:13:06.762 --> 01:13:09.763
What are you talking about? We had a deal.
I know I can't stop progress,

01:13:09.765 --> 01:13:11.799
but I can do everything
in my power to delay it.

01:13:11.801 --> 01:13:13.534
No, you can't do that.
We had a deal.

01:13:13.536 --> 01:13:15.703
No, please don't
destroy my daughter.

01:13:15.705 --> 01:13:17.705
Please don't destroy my
daughter! I'm sorry, Vincent.

01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:20.674
- I don't have a choice.
- Don't destroy my daughter!

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.089
Admin to Cell 8. Prisoner 226,

01:13:35.091 --> 01:13:37.224
report to the medical station.

01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:58.279
Well, well, well.

01:13:58.281 --> 01:14:01.649
You really are a little angel of
death and destruction, aren't you?

01:14:01.651 --> 01:14:04.485
No, sir. I am just a machine.

01:14:06.821 --> 01:14:09.356
Get it ready for
training in Taiwan.

01:14:09.358 --> 01:14:11.425
It needs one last test. Yes, sir.

01:14:11.427 --> 01:14:14.895
If you really want to
know, all you have to do is look closer.

01:14:14.897 --> 01:14:16.977
Please don't destroy my daughter!

01:14:34.082 --> 01:14:36.951
I'm sorry, Vincent,

01:14:36.953 --> 01:14:39.186
but your knowledge
is too dangerous.

01:14:40.722 --> 01:14:44.158
I don't expect you to believe me,
but this is for the greater good.

01:14:45.727 --> 01:14:47.294
When I give the order,

01:14:47.296 --> 01:14:50.164
I want you to shoot
Vincent once in the head.

01:14:55.705 --> 01:14:56.937
Fire.

01:15:01.943 --> 01:15:03.978
Good. Back you go.

01:15:06.047 --> 01:15:08.048
Take Vincent back to his cell.

01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:16.790
That can't be right.

01:15:23.164 --> 01:15:24.732
Jesus.

01:15:24.734 --> 01:15:28.335
Oh!

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.372
- What?
- TIM) It's a battery.

01:15:31.374 --> 01:15:34.074
- What was?
- <i>Vincent said it was part of it's higher brain functions.</i>

01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:37.878
<i>But he's a lying bastard. It's
just a backup to it's G.P.S.</i>

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.648
That doesn't make any sense.
How can you remove the G.P.S.?

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.616
Because the bomb doesn't
work without it.

01:15:43.351 --> 01:15:44.918
Test room.

01:15:51.493 --> 01:15:54.762
Shut down the base. Kill the
machine and Vincent on sight.

01:15:54.764 --> 01:15:58.532
<i>Security teams are engaged.</i>

01:16:04.673 --> 01:16:06.240
The soldiers can speak?

01:16:06.242 --> 01:16:08.042
They've always been able to.

01:16:08.044 --> 01:16:10.344
Their language is mostly
transmitted thoughts.

01:16:10.346 --> 01:16:12.913
Their words are evolved, efficient.

01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:14.682
Why didn't they tell us?

01:16:14.684 --> 01:16:17.117
Because they are part
of the new world,

01:16:17.119 --> 01:16:19.153
and you are part of the old.

01:16:25.694 --> 01:16:27.261
Where are you going?

01:16:27.263 --> 01:16:29.129
To save my daughter's program.

01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:31.231
You'll die. I have to try.

01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:33.767
I'll go.

01:16:33.769 --> 01:16:35.335
Okay.

01:16:35.337 --> 01:16:37.337
Destroy the quantum computer.

01:17:07.135 --> 01:17:08.802
Turn off all the
soldiers' implants.

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:10.971
<i>Termination codes required.</i>

01:17:42.003 --> 01:17:44.805
Security breached, sector eight.

01:18:00.455 --> 01:18:02.289
Take armor piercing.

01:18:10.031 --> 01:18:13.534
Scientific
staff must evacuate immediately.

01:18:20.675 --> 01:18:22.309
<i>Implant deactivated.</i>

01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:25.512
<i>Fifty-eight percent of
implants deactivated.</i>

01:18:25.514 --> 01:18:27.514
<i>Implant deactivated.</i>

01:18:29.984 --> 01:18:31.585
<i>Implant deactivated.</i>

01:18:32.887 --> 01:18:35.455
Access to brain-implant
control denied.

01:18:35.457 --> 01:18:38.959
Administrator access only.
System error.

01:18:38.961 --> 01:18:40.928
System error.

01:18:48.336 --> 01:18:50.070
Get away from it.

01:19:04.152 --> 01:19:05.919
Fix it.

01:19:05.921 --> 01:19:07.554
Fix it.

01:19:08.289 --> 01:19:09.857
No.

01:19:09.859 --> 01:19:11.859
Do it.

01:20:06.648 --> 01:20:08.015
Blast doors.

01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:18.792
Administrator override.

01:21:08.776 --> 01:21:10.477
Now you listen to me.

01:21:10.479 --> 01:21:12.946
I'm...

01:21:12.948 --> 01:21:16.383
I'm...

01:21:16.385 --> 01:21:21.388
Now you remember...
You remember who I am.

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:23.824
Hmm? I'm the master.

01:21:23.826 --> 01:21:26.126
You... You do what I tell you.

01:21:26.128 --> 01:21:30.464
You obey my orders, yes? You obey
my orders. You do exactly what I...

01:21:30.466 --> 01:21:32.666
You can't delete Mary's program.

01:21:32.668 --> 01:21:34.801
I had Suri change the password.

01:21:34.803 --> 01:21:37.337
Now...

01:21:37.339 --> 01:21:39.506
Now you listen to me. You don't...

01:21:39.508 --> 01:21:42.242
You don't hurt me. You don't...
Don't...

01:21:42.244 --> 01:21:43.877
Please, you don't need to kill me.

01:21:43.879 --> 01:21:45.946
No. I don't.

01:21:45.948 --> 01:21:49.983
No. That's right. That's right.

01:21:49.985 --> 01:21:52.052
That's good. That's very good.

01:21:52.054 --> 01:21:54.521
I just need to make
you dead inside.

01:21:55.757 --> 01:21:57.324
Like you tried to make me.

01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:12.906
Alpha Six Foxtrot.

01:22:12.908 --> 01:22:16.009
There is a radioactive leak
in the missile silo...

01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:17.644
in Quadrant Foxtrot 6.

01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:20.147
Evacuate the area immediately.

01:22:27.688 --> 01:22:30.690
I need to find out whether my daughter's
files are still on the system.

01:22:30.692 --> 01:22:34.294
They are.
It will be safer if I copy them.

01:22:35.063 --> 01:22:37.564
How? I can put them here.

01:22:40.234 --> 01:22:43.670
If you don't trust
me, I understand.

01:22:44.972 --> 01:22:48.608
You risked your child for me.
I will never forget that.

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:50.977
You're the future.

01:22:54.415 --> 01:22:57.217
She'll need you more
than me in her new life.

01:23:04.826 --> 01:23:06.460
I trust you.

01:23:34.722 --> 01:23:36.790
This has all the
base's records on it.

01:23:36.792 --> 01:23:39.426
It'll tell you what
happened to your son.

01:23:58.379 --> 01:24:00.480
How are you feeling this
morning, sweetheart?

01:24:00.482 --> 01:24:03.517
<i>Happy. Can I play another game?</i>

01:24:03.519 --> 01:24:05.585
Sure. Of course you can.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.054
What's wrong?

01:24:08.056 --> 01:24:11.024
I want to play with Mommy, not you.

01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:18.176
