WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:04.390
The victim was stabbed upward
of 30 times. Every rib is marked.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.711
- Vertebrae sternaI, vertebrae costaI.
- What kind of weapon?

00:07.800 --> 00:11.839
Vacations in the desert. It's
like lunching at the dump.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.070
Pointed, with no cutting edge.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.720
Like a giant ice pick.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.358
Whoa, Angela.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.795
Or a sharpened screwdriver.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.795
- We told her, "Cover up, avoid melanoma"?
- Who's the guy?

00:25.880 --> 00:28.952
- Her boyfriend Kirk.
- Angela has a boyfriend?

00:29.040 --> 00:33.033
Every year for three weeks, Angela
has a boyfriend and a vacation.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.875
Whoa. Playing house in a postboho
rustic artist's cabin in the desert

00:37.960 --> 00:42.351
with her pseudo-celebrity photographer
boyfriend. That is not a vacation.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.590
Eight months to a year dead, correct?

00:44.680 --> 00:49.117
Yeah, yeah. PupaI casings, maggots,
blah blah blah. Eight months to a year.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.159
Angela, we're betting. Are you
using Crisco or butter for sunscreen?

00:53.600 --> 00:57.229
Hey, Brennan, could I talk
to you in private, please?

01:01.160 --> 01:03.879
<i>- Y ou'll think I'm crazy.
- Boyfriend trouble?</i>

01:03.960 --> 01:07.475
No, I'd... I'd just send it to
you, but the sheriff won't let me.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.232
Send what?

01:09.320 --> 01:13.074
Somebody left a human skull in
a box on the sheriff's porch.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.072
He says it was probably a
Navaho who respects the dead,

01:16.160 --> 01:19.675
but doesn't wanna get pulled in
to the whole white justice system.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.912
The thing is is that Kirk went out into
the desert five days ago on a photo shoot

01:24.000 --> 01:27.356
and he hasn't come back. Nobody
can find him or his guide.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.671
<i>- You think the skull is Kirk's?
- No. No.</i>

01:30.760 --> 01:33.320
Kirk's always going
into the desert for days.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.119
You're really sending
me mixed messages, Ange.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.998
Yeah, well, I'm freaking out, I guess.

01:39.080 --> 01:42.436
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
called. Pretend I didn't call.

01:42.520 --> 01:46.559
I'll just... I'll talk to you
when Kirk gets back. Sorry.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.079
- You're taking a vacation in the desert?
- I don't get the attraction.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.310
- Snakes, scorpions.
- Only for a few days.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.630
- Buzzards.
- What about the stabbing?

01:57.720 --> 02:00.996
Zack identified the weapon
and the victim. Ourjob is done.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.918
It's not like I actually
think that the skull is Kirk's,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.515
but, I mean, if you could just
look at it and just tell me it isn't

02:14.600 --> 02:17.398
then I could stop worrying
about him being dead

02:17.480 --> 02:21.268
and just be mad at him
for being a flaky artist.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.272
You won't get anything here. We're 100
miles past where Jesus lost his sandals.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.999
I assume that's a way
of saying we're isolated.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.116
Yeah. That's why we come out here.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.113
It's like you stand still and the
whole universe just comes at you.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.838
At 110 degrees.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.037
You know, Kirk was out with a good guide
- our friend Dhani.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.432
I mean, he said he'd be back. He
said we'd go out for nachos and beer.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.911
And this is a man who's
serious about his beer.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.239
I got the Navaho police looking between
Dano Ona Canyon and the Otero Bluffs.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.313
Dr Brennan is a forensic anthropologist
with the Jeffersonian Institution.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.676
I spend my time helping the FBI
conduct murder investigations.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.753
Angie, I got my hands full getting
searchers out to look for Dhani and Kirk.

03:07.840 --> 03:13.551
State police said they'd lend us a chopper,
but only if we narrow down the search area.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.916
They gotta be running low on
water. I give them a couple of days.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.632
- Ben, if you could show Dr Brennan the skull.
- Or point me toward the morgue.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.240 --> 03:34.834
Welcome to the Merville County morgue.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.993
Prominent brow ridge indicates
the victim is male. Do you mind?

03:49.440 --> 03:54.036
- Be my guest.
- She wants the plate, Ben, not the muffin.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.757
CraniaI shape and nasaI
features suggest Caucasian.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.037
- Died in the last severaI days.
- Critters been at it good.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.999
Pattern of basilar suture
fusion puts age 30 to 35.

04:08.080 --> 04:12.358
- Well, it doesn't look like Kirk.
- It doesn't look like anyone, Angie.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.199
Putrescine.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.875
- Early stages of decomp.
- Cause of death?

04:21.959 --> 04:26.078
A man gets caught unawares out in the
desert, he could be dead in a few hours.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.559
- Uh-oh.
- What?

04:27.640 --> 04:31.189
Base of the skull here,
detached from the spinaI cord.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.159
See these little beveI marks?
Perimortem contact with gunshot.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.550
It wasn't the desert who
caught this man unawares.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.313
It was someone with a gun.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.993
- You can't say that it's Kirk.
- I know.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.915
You want some tea?

05:26.920 --> 05:29.115
I'd rather have a beer.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.190
This woman modelling in
these pictures, is this Dhani?

05:42.280 --> 05:46.159
Yeah. Dhani Webber. It's
Kirk's guide in the desert.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.119
- She's beautifuI.
- Dhani's lived here her whole life.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.397
Ben says that she knows the
desert better than anybody.

05:53.480 --> 05:58.713
There's no way that she gets lost or she
runs out of water. There's just no way.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.712
- No.
- What?

06:01.800 --> 06:05.793
If you hug me and you be all caring,
it's because you think Kirk is dead.

06:05.880 --> 06:10.715
- Or because he was sleeping with Dhani.
- No. It's because...

06:11.840 --> 06:17.392
I'm sorry that my friend is upset
because someone she loves is missing.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.198
All right.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.191
I can buy that.

06:25.400 --> 06:29.393
You know, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna head to bed.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.471
Good night.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.795
OK. Booth.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.236
- How far are you from Dulles?
- As far as your office is.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.118
- What?
- I need your findings on the Richmond case.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.033
Zack won't tell me unless
you give him permission.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.111
There's a 9:15 flight to Denver,

06:48.200 --> 06:52.193
then an 11:35 flight to Santa Fe. You'll
have to run to make the connection.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.431
- Forget it.
- Booth. Please.

06:55.960 --> 06:59.839
Angela's boyfriend is
missing, maybe dead.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.354
- It took all of my charm...
- Oh, boy.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.874
.. to get the sheriff to
let me look at the skull.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.349
When I asked to send
it to the Jeffersonian,

07:07.440 --> 07:10.591
he told me I am not a cop and
I don't have any jurisdiction.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.717
Which is true. OK, look.
What do you want me to do?

07:13.800 --> 07:16.189
I want you to get federaI on his ass.

07:30.360 --> 07:35.559
Hey. There you go. People in the desert don't
have actuaI addresses. What's up with that?

07:35.640 --> 07:39.189
<i>- You made it.
- Yeah. I'm touring the hottest places.</i>

07:39.280 --> 07:42.317
Next stop - there
you go - hell.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.755
I'm not really awake yet.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.354
Last night before I
left I used my FBI powers

07:47.440 --> 07:50.671
to force the sheriff to send
the skull to the Jeffersonian.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.638
I talked to him this
morning. He seems resentfuI.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.314
- What time is it?
- Let's go. Drink that on the way.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.269
- On the way where?
- To the modeI, guide, whatever's place.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.351
Dhani. Can I come with you?

08:03.440 --> 08:08.150
- We can ask tougher questions without you.
- Wait outside while I get dressed.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.755
No. The sun's been up for an
hour. It's the surface of Mercury.

08:11.840 --> 08:17.631
I can stand here and close my eyes, eat
my doughnuts. It's the best I can do, OK?

08:23.920 --> 08:27.356
What tougher questions can we
ask without Angela being here?

08:27.440 --> 08:30.512
Things like did her boyfriend
run off with the modeI guide?

08:30.600 --> 08:33.193
We discussed this. She
said it couldn't happen.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.318
No offence, but she doesn't know this
guy. She's with him three weeks a year.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.791
No offence, but you are a stodgy
traditionalist when it comes to relationships.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.950
Stodgy? Stodgy.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.190
- OK, here's the deaI.
- Yeah, stodgy.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.590
We find out the skull isn't Kirk,
we let the locals handle it, OK?

08:49.680 --> 08:52.319
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, you say, "Of course".

08:52.400 --> 08:55.949
But then you get all caught
up in it, and then... What?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.268
Oh.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.636
- What do you want?
- FBI. We're looking for Dhani Webber.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.188
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy holding the big gun.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.078
On a federaI agent, which
I've been nice about so far.

09:06.160 --> 09:11.996
- Let's rush him. He can't shoot us both.
- How about I just show him my badge?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.672
OK?

09:13.760 --> 09:17.958
- Alex Joseph. This is me and Dhani's place.
- Where's Dhani Webber?

09:18.040 --> 09:21.715
Missing. In the desert for almost
a week. I've been looking for her.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.031
- You point your gun at everybody?
- Maybe I'm nervous.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.954
Anything you might be nervous about?
Something Dhani got caught up in?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.634
- Nothing I can think of.
- Can we look inside?

09:31.720 --> 09:35.315
- Not without a warrant.
- You have a problem with law enforcement?

09:35.760 --> 09:37.830
You could say that, I guess.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.948
ModeI runs off with handsome photographer,
boyfriend with a gun finds them in the desert.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.077
- He's twitchy.
- What if he's escaping out the back door?

09:51.160 --> 09:54.630
You don't spend a lot of
time in trailers, do you?

09:59.080 --> 10:00.991
Hah. Whoa.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.911
What? That's Sheriff Dawes.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.039
Yeah, he definitely has a
problem with law enforcement.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.189
Huh.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.791
Dr Brennan doesn't like us to
listen to music while working.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.916
Dr Brennan is not here.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.754
She thinks the work deserves our
full concentration. I need the skull.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.594
I'm still finding particulates.
Since you're Dr Brennan's assistant,

10:24.680 --> 10:27.478
without her, you don't
carry that much weight here.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.279
I'm telling Dr Goodman.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.668
Why didn't you mention
your relationship to Dhani?

10:36.760 --> 10:41.072
Dhani Webber drop you for the
photographer, the Indian guy, or both?

10:41.160 --> 10:43.913
Moron. Dhani's my sister.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.470
Half-sister. Mostly I raised
her. You can check with Angie.

10:47.560 --> 10:53.908
OK, we got that wrong. I pretty much don't
like the look of your sister's boyfriend Alex.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.358
Assault, narcotics, bootlegs for the
reservation. Yeah, Dhani could do better.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.113
Any chance Dhani got caught
up with something ugly?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.476
Till I find otherwise, I'm
assuming Dhani and Kirk are lost.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.109
Alex Joseph
- is he bad enough to hurt them if he finds them together?

11:09.200 --> 11:12.237
<i>It's on my list of nightmares, yeah.</i>

11:13.400 --> 11:16.437
- Brennan.
- DNA results are in.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.398
The skull is definitely Kirk Persinger.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.032
Poor Angela.

11:23.120 --> 11:27.238
<i>The hair tests off the charts for
Lophophora williamsii-derived mescaline.</i>

11:27.320 --> 11:29.117
- What's that?
- Peyote.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.791
<i>- Anything on the scoring?
- I haven't had a crack at it.</i>

11:32.880 --> 11:38.034
Hodgins hogged it. The markings trace
to severaI desert-dwelling species.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.671
It seems a full-grown male coyote did the
most work, but one with a malformed jaw.

11:42.760 --> 11:48.551
- Very unusuaI bite formations.
- Ask Dr Goodman to find a naturalist.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.756
Kirk Persinger?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.673
Yes. They found traces of peyote.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.389
Drug related. Shot to the spine,
execution style. So, Sheriff,

11:58.480 --> 12:02.268
do you still think this is a
simple missing persons case?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.794
I have to tell Angela.

12:08.080 --> 12:14.030
Listen, Sheriff, I'm sorry for the concern
you must be feeling for your sister.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.155
Yeah.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.839
I will call the FBI office in Albuquerque
and take over the investigation.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.399
- I wouldn't.
- Why?

12:27.480 --> 12:31.871
Desert dwellers are very insular.
Mongolians, Bedouins of the Sahara,

12:31.960 --> 12:36.750
the Himba of Kanana. Good hosts, but
extremely distrustfuI of outsiders.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.877
This is the United States of
America, not Outer Mongolia.

12:39.960 --> 12:44.112
The only reason Sheriff Dawes talks
to us at all is because we know Angela.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.875
- Alex Joseph held a gun on us.
- I admit, I've met friendlier people.

12:47.960 --> 12:52.397
If a bunch of outsiders come in from
Albuquerque, led by an outsider from DC,

12:52.480 --> 12:57.190
I promise you, the people here will
close ranks and shut up untiI we go away.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.478
- Then they'll take care of it in their own way.
- OK. Who are you? Dr PhiI?

13:01.560 --> 13:04.597
- Who's Dr PhiI? Some kind of expert?
- He likes to think so.

13:04.680 --> 13:10.516
OK, I'll take what you say under advisement.
We need to find out who gave Kirk his peyote.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.239
How are we gonna do that?

13:13.320 --> 13:15.914
Talk to his girlfriend.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.357
I'm so sorry, Angela. We both are.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.429
I knew it was Kirk.

13:23.520 --> 13:28.150
That's why I called you. We have
to find out what happened to Dhani.

13:28.240 --> 13:33.951
Angela, I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of difficult questions, OK?

13:34.040 --> 13:37.271
What can you tell me
about Kirk's drug use?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.749
Kirk didn't do drugs.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.752
Hodgins found peyote in his hair.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.674
<i>I thought that you meant drug drugs.</i>

13:46.760 --> 13:51.470
The peyote wasn't recreationaI. Kirk
took part in some native Indian rites.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.233
While high on drugs.

13:54.680 --> 13:58.639
- Did you do peyote with Kirk?
- The peyote has nothing to do with anything.

13:58.720 --> 14:04.352
Angela, you may have come in contact with
Kirk's killer without even realising it.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.469
Who was his connection?

14:09.520 --> 14:12.114
He's Kirk's friend.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.869
- I need the name.
- Wayne.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.520
Wayne Kellogg.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.319
He's an important locaI artist.

14:34.720 --> 14:40.397
I don't deny having participated in the peyote
rituaI on severaI occasions. Utterly spirituaI.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.835
- You're not Indian.
- Not by birth, no.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.232
But as you can see from my artwork, I have
a deep spirituaI connection to the Navaho.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.039
- Do you sell a lot of work?
- I sell well overseas.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.192
Enough to keep this place
and a beach house in LA. Why?

14:53.280 --> 14:56.272
Why not buy Navaho art
created by actuaI Navahos?

14:56.360 --> 14:59.716
Peyote is only legaI if you belong
to the Native American Church.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.634
You and Kirk bought it illegally,
which involves drug dealers.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.188
You can follow my train
of thought, can't you?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.953
Look, I realise Kirk's missing.

15:09.040 --> 15:13.397
- Kirk's not missing.
- He's dead.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.598
- What about Dhani?
- Dhani Webber remains unaccounted for.

15:18.800 --> 15:23.351
- God, this is terrible.
- I need the name of your drug connection.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.193
No. I'm sorry.

15:26.280 --> 15:31.832
They trust me. I understand the difficulty in
finding peyote plants miles out in the desert,

15:31.920 --> 15:35.390
secret places passed on from
generation to generation.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.040
Mr Kellogg, is that your vehicle?

15:38.120 --> 15:40.236
Yes. Why?

15:40.320 --> 15:43.232
Alex Joseph borrowed that Humvee.

15:44.720 --> 15:49.714
Alex Joseph didn't go to the desert to look
for Dhani, he went out to look for peyote.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.439
I never said that.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.998
Mr Joseph, it's FBI again.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.675
<i>I'd like to ask you
a few more questions.</i>

16:03.760 --> 16:05.751
Booth?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.511
Booth.

16:21.880 --> 16:26.476
Oh, come on, Sheriff. Come on. Even out
here, you know how the drug world works.

16:26.560 --> 16:30.997
Kirk is found dead, Joseph is
beaten to a pulp. It's all connected.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.278
- My priority is to find Dhani.
- Find Kirk's murderer, we probably find her.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.035
Maybe Dhani is the
murderer. What? I gotta ask.

16:39.120 --> 16:43.352
Dhani never hurt anybody in
her life, except maybe herself.

16:43.440 --> 16:49.072
You know, another thing I have to consider,
maybe Dhani calls up her brother the sheriff

16:49.160 --> 16:52.789
and says, "This photographer
raped me. What do I do now?"

16:52.880 --> 16:57.237
What you're proving now is you don't know
anything about the people that live here.

16:57.320 --> 17:02.678
Joseph met us with a rifle. Maybe he was
afraid it was you coming around the corner.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.319
Alex Joseph is unconscious.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.960
You maybe can talk to
him when he wakes up.

17:08.040 --> 17:13.239
Me, I'm going to help the
search parties find my sister.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.589
Thanks to Fish and Wildlife,
most coyote packs in this region

17:19.680 --> 17:22.512
have at least one member
wearing a GPS collar.

17:22.599 --> 17:26.148
You can find one coyote with
a wonky jaw in the desert?

17:26.240 --> 17:30.836
What we do here is process information
from rangers, amateur naturalists,

17:30.920 --> 17:33.434
conservationists, even schooI groups.

17:33.520 --> 17:38.435
The desert coyote pack's range is
not huge, perhaps ten square miles.

17:38.520 --> 17:43.435
The pack is typically three to eight
animals, led by the alpha mating pair.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.273
- Wow.
- What wow?

17:46.360 --> 17:51.115
Professor Inez has found your coyote,
but he's way out in the desert.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.716
Three pups, three females, two males,
including the leader with the wonky jaw.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.870
With eight coyotes going at a cadaver,

17:57.960 --> 18:01.396
we're talking needle in a
haystack finding the remains.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.630
The mamas and the pups feed together

18:03.720 --> 18:07.599
so I'd expect ribcage and smaller
bones to be in a concentrated area,

18:07.680 --> 18:13.437
but the males move away from each other with
larger pieces. No more than a half a mile.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.912
Three weeks a year, 15 weeks in totaI.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.717
- You think that's crazy?
- Well...

18:22.720 --> 18:25.359
It's not typicaI, that's for sure.

18:25.440 --> 18:30.753
And if he was yours, 100%
yours, for three weeks a year,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.796
that's...

18:35.840 --> 18:38.957
that's more than I've ever had.

18:40.840 --> 18:46.278
Kirk's photographs show the world as a more
beautifuI place than it is. A better place.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.508
He made me feeI like
that was my reaI home,

18:50.960 --> 18:54.350
that I belonged there with him.

18:55.800 --> 19:00.157
He's the guy I compare
all other guys to.

19:02.920 --> 19:09.155
Now he's gone and I feeI like I can't even
breathe, sweetie. I can't even take a breath.

19:12.080 --> 19:16.232
You think it's possible that Dhani's
still out there? Could she still be alive?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.629
I don't know. There's no crime scene

19:18.720 --> 19:23.191
and we're not even sure where
the rest of Kirk's remains are.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.556
- I want to help you look for her tomorrow.
- Are you sure?

19:26.640 --> 19:29.598
Yeah. Dhani was our friend.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.229
I have to help find her. Please.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.310
I love the desert.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.597
- Or I used to.
- Nothing looks the way it should.

19:52.680 --> 19:56.150
Stuff that's far away looks
near, stuff that's near looks far.

19:56.240 --> 20:00.518
Yeah, well, you can't trust your
eyes out here. Not your eyes alone.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.752
You know, Kirk said that if
you stood still long enough,

20:04.840 --> 20:08.719
that the desert would
actually speak to you.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.994
- Show you some kind of truth.
- That ever happen to you?

20:13.080 --> 20:16.038
No, but he really believed that.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.200
- Alex Joseph woke up.
- Good.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.235
You think whoever beat him up had
something to do with Kirk's murder?

20:30.320 --> 20:32.117
- Yeah.
- No.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.908
How can you be so sure?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.275
- You were the one that beat him up?
- No.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.635
OK, well,

20:40.720 --> 20:42.711
do you know who did?

20:42.800 --> 20:45.792
These guys. Or guys just like them.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.678
- Why?
- Peyote rituaI.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.672
These people take it
seriously. It's their religion.

20:51.760 --> 20:57.039
Alex Joseph starts selling it to white guys
like Kellogg and Kirk, they don't like it.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.591
- Aren't you gonna arrest any of them?
- No, but I might deputise a couple.

21:01.680 --> 21:05.309
Sheriff, I get how you handle
things out here, but I gotta ask you,

21:05.400 --> 21:11.157
if they beat up an Indian for selling peyote,
what are they gonna do to Kirk for taking it?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.391
Nothing. Kirk's a white man.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.278
The way they see it,
he's my responsibility.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.113
<i>Hey! We've got something over here!</i>

21:20.200 --> 21:21.997
Sheriff Dawes!

21:39.960 --> 21:44.272
Ange, they found some bones
over here. It might be Kirk.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.875
- It is Kirk. This is his camera.
- Are you sure?

21:49.280 --> 21:54.354
No, no, no. Don't. Don't. There
could be exposed film in there.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.431
It's cracked.

21:56.520 --> 22:00.308
We can't let any more light
in. It'll damage the film.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.436
Maybe Kirk was right.

22:02.520 --> 22:06.559
This could be a good way for the
desert to tell us what happened to him -

22:06.640 --> 22:09.677
a photograph of his murderer.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.873
This camera's going to
the state police crime lab.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.669
Angela is better at developing
film than anyone in Santa Fe.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.558
I can use Kirk's equipment.
It's top of the line.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.108
And we won't have to
wait for results, Sheriff.

22:28.200 --> 22:33.991
With your sister maybe still alive
out in the desert, every hour counts.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.515
<i>- I can't do it.
- Booth.</i>

22:38.600 --> 22:45.119
According to Homeland Security, Kellogg
sold exactly $120,000 worth of art overseas.

22:45.200 --> 22:49.716
- What's that got to do with anything?
- It doesn't buy him a beach house in LA.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.836
He lied. Let's go check him out.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.434
- What will we look for?
- What we always look for.

22:54.520 --> 22:59.753
Something that doesn't fit,
something, you know... something.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.756
I can't believe that you
think that I'm a suspect.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.434
Angie, not to speak ill of the dead,

23:08.520 --> 23:13.799
but a woman like you, you're worth more
than three weeks a year, you understand?

23:13.880 --> 23:19.716
- I murdered Kirk cos he didn't give me time?
- I'm just a law man. People are people.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.554
Ben, Kirk wasn't the one who
put limits on our time together.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.918
He wanted me to marry him. And
he deserved more. And better.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.798
Please, Ben, I wanna help find Dhani,

23:30.880 --> 23:33.394
and there could be
evidence on this film.

23:33.480 --> 23:37.439
Just let me do what I do
better than anybody else.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.191
Thank you.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.878
Angie.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.919
Maybe he deserved more.
It's not my place to say.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.151
But he couldn't have
done better. No man could.

24:06.200 --> 24:12.116
I haven't attained anything like the
success Kirk has, but I do all right. Why?

24:12.200 --> 24:16.273
- You have a beach house.
- I applied for a warrant to check your assets.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.992
I told you, I do well in Europe. Germany
especially appreciates native-themed work.

24:22.080 --> 24:26.471
- Kirk's remains were way out in the desert.
- What's that got to do with me?

24:26.560 --> 24:29.677
Because you have a vehicle
capable of going out that far.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.035
A vehicle I often loan out.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.749
- What are these?
- Engraving plates. Please don't touch them.

24:35.840 --> 24:40.755
The oils on your skin will compromise
the integrity. Why would I kill Kirk?

24:40.840 --> 24:44.116
Maybe because, you know, you
had a little thing for Dhani.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.829
Or maybe because you were jealous
of Kirk's artistic success.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.469
- These aren't native designs.
- I'm working a line of inquiry here.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.554
All of your work is stolen from native
designs. These are floraI. It doesn't fit.

24:56.640 --> 25:01.430
Not stolen, inspired by. And
that piece is commissioned.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.159
<i>Another way I make money.</i>

25:04.240 --> 25:05.229
Hi, Angela.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.915
Most of the film was wrecked, but
I developed a few usable images.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.470
- That's great.
- No, because Ben got me to make prints,

25:12.560 --> 25:15.074
and then he bolted with
them and the negatives.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.277
- Dawes took off with the negatives.
- What did she find?

25:18.360 --> 25:22.319
- Did you recognise anything?
- Dhani in the desert.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.597
That's all. I have no idea
what he got so excited about.

25:25.680 --> 25:29.514
- Nothing that meant anything to Angela.
- We'll go take a look ourselves.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.431
Talk to you again.

25:33.040 --> 25:37.591
- I wanted to show these photos to Joseph.
- Why Joseph?

25:37.680 --> 25:40.911
Angela says they're only photos
of your sister in the desert.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.959
Right. The only person that knows
the desert as good as Dhani is Joseph.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.508
This formation here,
I'm not familiar with it.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.956
There's nothing like this near
Kirk's remains or the camera.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.679
He was killed somewhere else and moved.

25:53.760 --> 25:58.072
If we find that outcropping, maybe we
find where Kirk was killed and my sister.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.151
- Did Joseph recognise it?
- Yeah.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.232
- Where?
- It's easier I take you than explain.

26:03.320 --> 26:07.677
Whoa. OK. If Joseph is the murderer,
he'd just send you on a wild-goose chase.

26:07.760 --> 26:11.799
Then we know he's the murderer and all
we've wasted is gas and a goose chase.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.314
How far out are we going?

26:14.400 --> 26:16.470
A ways.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.759
One week in the desert and
there's nothing but bone.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.479
- Same guy?
- Looks like it.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.075
I think it would be better if I
went over the bones before you start.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.197
I disagree, and you can't have
them unless I release them.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.635
You're gonna have to
do the boss thing, boss.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.872
Sir, Dr Brennan needs to know how
this man died, which is my territory,

26:40.960 --> 26:43.394
- more than when and where he died.
- Dr Hodgins.

26:43.480 --> 26:47.359
Even I can see he got shot in the
head. Dr Brennan needs the murder scene.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.718
It's the desert. Particulates aren't
going to narrow it down any more than that.

26:51.800 --> 26:55.315
We won't know that untiI
I look at the particulates.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.274
Dr Hodgins will have access
to the bones first, Mr Addy.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.835
That's the wrong decision.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.070
My lungs are gonna come out my throat.

27:15.160 --> 27:19.358
Where I come from, when you say you're
driving a ways, it means 45 minutes.

27:19.440 --> 27:23.115
- Out here it means four hours.
- We've been driving five.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.431
I maybe should've said quite a ways.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.669
There it is.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.991
Well...

27:42.080 --> 27:45.789
- That it?
- Yeah, I think so. Different time of day.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.872
You look for the exact spot
the pictures were taken.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.349
I'm gonna take another
circle in the truck.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.431
- Looking for your sister?
- Yeah.

27:53.520 --> 27:57.399
I think we want to go south
slightly, maybe southwest.

27:57.480 --> 28:03.476
- You can tell from the shadows?
- Yeah, and the angle on the outcropping.

28:04.920 --> 28:08.356
- Where's he going?
- He's looking for his sister.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.278
Either of you two bring any water?

28:15.320 --> 28:17.629
- Why? Are you worried?
- Yeah.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.039
About what?

28:19.120 --> 28:22.590
Because we're way past
where Jesus lost his sandals.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.592
And I don't hear the truck any more.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.919
Great.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.749
No cellphone service, no water.

28:38.840 --> 28:42.549
How long do you think we'll survive
if the sheriff doesn't come back?

28:42.640 --> 28:45.234
- Three days.
- How far are we from the highway?

28:45.320 --> 28:49.199
- Five days, minimum.
- I don't like that math.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.670
Wait a second.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.637
<i>- Kirk's?
- It looks like it, yeah.</i>

29:01.040 --> 29:06.068
Yeah. The distributor's smashed.
All the wires are pulled out.

29:06.160 --> 29:11.154
It doesn't make sense that he brings us to
the scene of the crime and leaves us to die.

29:11.240 --> 29:15.153
One godforsaken part of desert is
as good as another godforsaken part.

29:15.240 --> 29:19.438
We don't even know if Sheriff
Dawes actually called Alex Joseph.

29:19.520 --> 29:23.911
- I mean, he could've done all this himself.
- Could Dawes do that, Ange?

29:24.360 --> 29:29.195
Well, I always thought Ben Dawes was a good
man. It would take a lot to change my mind.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.396
Like being left to die in the desert?

29:31.480 --> 29:35.473
These tracks, they don't match the
sheriff's vehicle. They're too wide.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.630
Humvee maybe?

29:38.080 --> 29:40.674
This is blood, I think.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.755
The victim was kneeling here.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.831
Bones.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.229
Sorry.

29:49.160 --> 29:53.199
He was dragged this way,
then the blood traiI ends.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.555
He was thrown into the Humvee.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.438
We're 200 miles from where
we found Kirk's bones.

29:58.520 --> 30:03.310
You think the murderer drove that far
to drop the body? Where are you going?

30:03.400 --> 30:05.197
Booth.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.593
The tracks, they stop right here.

30:08.680 --> 30:12.150
- What here? There's no here here.
- Landing strip, huh?

30:12.240 --> 30:14.629
I knew this was about drugs.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.949
Mexico's about 80 miles that way.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.238
Oh, yes!

30:23.320 --> 30:28.189
Only Angela could get a ride
in the middle of nowhere.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.952
- Any signs of your sister?
- She's been out there a week.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.998
She could be alive if she
had a few canteens of water.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.833
- Humvee tracks, Sheriff.
- Alex Joseph?

30:40.280 --> 30:42.669
Catches Kirk and Dhani out here...

30:42.760 --> 30:46.878
<i>- Sandy, this is Dawes. Do you receive me?
- Loud and clear. Where are you?</i>

30:46.960 --> 30:52.557
Hell and gone. I need a deputy down at the
clinic to slap some cuffs on Alex Joseph.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.996
<i>Alex Joseph took off, Sheriff.
We've got no idea where he went.</i>

30:56.080 --> 30:57.433
Kellogg's Humvee.

30:57.520 --> 31:01.195
Sandy, go collect Wayne Kellogg's
Humvee. We'll see you in a few hours.

31:03.680 --> 31:10.074
Any blood stains should flare bluish
green when the LuminoI hits them.

31:11.400 --> 31:16.349
- Nothing.
- Kirk was put into the Humvee. Treads match.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.955
It's clean. Give Kellogg his truck back.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.157
- Tell him sorry for the inconvenience.
- Try the hood.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.835
You think they tied Kirk's bloody
dead body to the hood like an elk,

31:26.920 --> 31:30.629
then drove him 200 miles
before dumping him for coyotes?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.109
Even out here, people might notice.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.191
Right there.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.555
Hm.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.598
I'll be damned.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.477
Yeah.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.230
- Zack.
- Yes, Dr Brennan.

31:57.320 --> 32:01.108
Do the bones show more damage than
can be explained by animaI activity?

32:01.200 --> 32:04.237
Analysis indicates the
pubic rami are fractured

32:04.320 --> 32:07.357
and the left hemipelvis
is severely displaced.

32:07.440 --> 32:11.558
- Congruent with a fall?
- Yes. Were they found at the base of a cliff?

32:11.640 --> 32:15.155
He wasn't driven 200 miles, he
was driven a couple hundred yards.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.232
Loaded his body in the
airplane, then tossed it.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.392
I'm not happy with how long
it took you to get back to me.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.155
- We'll talk about it when I get back.
- Sorry, Dr Brennan.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.516
You could've told her
it wasn't your fault.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.119
I still have some work to do here.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.790
They dumped Kirk's body. They
could've done the same to Dhani.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.599
- Kirk was dead when they tossed him.
- Absolutely.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.399
And I saw no evidence of a
second murder at the site.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.190
Which leaves me hoping either my sister
was kidnapped or is dying in the desert.

32:53.280 --> 32:57.910
Kidnap is a federaI offence. It's an
FBI matter. I can help you if you want.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.513
Brennan.

32:59.600 --> 33:04.037
- Those photos you sent me of engravings.
- Kellogg said it was a commissioned work.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.714
<i>- I think these are engravers' plates.
- For what?</i>

33:06.800 --> 33:11.828
Currency. To be exact, I believe these are
dyes for the Venezuelan 500 bolívar bill.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.708
- Dyes? Counterfeiters' dyes?
- Yes.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.630
Did you say counterfeiters?

33:19.640 --> 33:23.155
I've got a warrant here to search
your studio for engraving plates.

33:23.240 --> 33:27.711
Well, as Mr Kellogg's attorney, I can
advise you you're certain to find some.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.233
I'm an engraver.

33:29.320 --> 33:33.711
Larry, did you tell Wayne how when someone
dies during the commission of a felony,

33:33.800 --> 33:36.792
everyone involved in that
felony is charged with murder?

33:36.880 --> 33:38.950
Counterfeiting is a felony.

33:41.360 --> 33:46.388
My client will confess to counterfeiting in
return for immunity from the murder charge.

33:46.480 --> 33:51.270
- Not good enough. - He will
provide the time of the next pick-up.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.749
You can arrest the actuaI murderers.

33:53.840 --> 33:58.550
When Sheriff Dawes says not good
enough, he means his sister, Larry.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.679
- He doesn't know anything about Dhani.
- What does he know?

34:06.920 --> 34:09.639
One week ago, I arranged
to meet some associates

34:09.719 --> 34:12.871
at an airstrip in the desert
to pass on commissioned art.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.871
He means counterfeit plates.

34:14.960 --> 34:19.556
As the plane landed, my associates
noticed two people spying on them

34:19.639 --> 34:24.156
from a vantage point above the
airstrip. They became very agitated.

34:24.239 --> 34:27.676
They commandeered my vehicle
and they drove up the hill.

34:27.760 --> 34:32.469
I got my Humvee, then I drove up
there, but I didn't see anything.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.233
Like blood on the hood of your vehicle?

34:36.719 --> 34:41.918
Well, the fact remains that
agreeing to this deaI is the only way

34:42.000 --> 34:47.199
that you're going to catch the actuaI
murderers. You know where to find me.

34:47.280 --> 34:51.512
Wayne, I need to know if they
loaded Dhani on that plane.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.319
I never saw Dhani.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.358
<i>- Sheriff.
- That's my sister. My sister!</i>

34:57.440 --> 35:00.591
I am truly sorry about
Dhani, Ben. Truly sorry.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.911
But I don't think Wayne knows anything.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.230
Come on, Dawes. Easy.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.719
Come on.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.510
I guess we're gonna have
to take that deaI, right?

35:19.680 --> 35:21.955
I was trained as an army ranger.

35:22.040 --> 35:25.316
- That mean anything to you, Sheriff Dawes?
- Yeah.

35:25.400 --> 35:30.679
I'd be happy to go back out to that crime
scene to see if there's anything we missed.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.399
Appreciate it.

35:34.240 --> 35:37.596
To win arguments here, you'll
need at least one doctorate.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.389
- I'm Dr Brennan's grad student.
- I'm aware.

35:41.480 --> 35:46.395
Once I get my doctorate, she'll take another
student. My job here will go to that person.

35:46.480 --> 35:52.476
You have a first-rate mind, Mr Addy.
You can't assist Dr Brennan forever.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.590
I really hope this is necessary.

35:57.680 --> 36:02.708
He's comfortable here. He's enamoured with
Dr Brennan and he's stopped his thesis.

36:02.800 --> 36:06.076
It's just... I like the guy.

36:06.160 --> 36:10.472
So do I, which is why we must
think of what's best for him.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.199
It's time for Mr Addy to grow up.

36:17.320 --> 36:20.039
- So you say Dhani knows the desert.
- That's right.

36:20.120 --> 36:23.396
If it were you here stranded,
which way would you go?

36:23.480 --> 36:26.438
Highway's about a
five-day walk that way.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.195
Mexico's three days that way, and
that way's two days to a ranch.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.716
You might find some stock water,
but the terrain is rougher.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.634
- So it all depends how much water she had.
- Is there any way to know?

36:37.720 --> 36:41.759
All right, look. We'll all take a
point off this compass, all right?

36:41.840 --> 36:45.958
Walk out in a straight line for
15 minutes and we look for tracks.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.837
OK?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.430
Are you all right?

38:07.560 --> 38:10.313
Dhani went that way.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.517
OK.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.793
Ready to go home?

39:03.880 --> 39:05.950
Yeah.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.997
You aren't coming back again, are you?

39:14.120 --> 39:15.872
No.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.439
Never.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.760
He loved me.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.316
For three weeks a year.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.879
No.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.633
He loved me all the time.

39:28.720 --> 39:33.077
I was the one who could only
manage three weeks a year.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.314
I'm afraid that I...

39:37.400 --> 39:40.676
I'm just afraid that I
don't have a generous heart.

39:40.760 --> 39:46.630
I'm afraid that I won't have the
chance that I had with Kirk ever again.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.310
You will.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.436
How can you be so sure?

39:52.520 --> 39:57.548
Because nothing in this universe
happens just once, Angela.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.436
Nothing. Infinity goes
in both directions.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.478
There is no unique event,

40:04.560 --> 40:07.836
no singular moment.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.388
I don't know what that means.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.268
It means you will get another chance.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.999
You promise?

40:17.640 --> 40:19.949
From your heart?

40:20.040 --> 40:22.952
Better. From my head.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.717
And, yes, Ange, I promise,

40:27.720 --> 40:29.915
from my heart,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.719
you will get another chance.

40:35.280 --> 40:39.319
Well, Dawes and his deputies,
they caught the counterfeiters.

40:39.400 --> 40:43.439
Dhani gave a statement saying it was
Kellogg who pulled the trigger on Kirk.

40:43.520 --> 40:47.354
Dhani knows that you pointed that
helicopter in the right direction.

40:47.440 --> 40:50.876
Obviously you subconsciously
sifted through rationaI facts

40:50.960 --> 40:53.838
and processed the most likely scenario.

40:53.920 --> 40:57.276
- I'm sure that's it.
- Yeah. What else could it be?

40:57.360 --> 40:59.555
It's the only rationaI explanation.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.757
Are you guys making fun of me?

41:02.840 --> 41:07.391
You know, let's go back home, where
there's water, shelter and living things.

41:07.480 --> 41:09.471
Come on.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.275
