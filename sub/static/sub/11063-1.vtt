03:17.280 --> 03:19.523
Tanya, Fievel?

03:19.600 --> 03:22.279
Will you stop that
twirling, twirling?

03:22.280 --> 03:23.639
Uh, no. No more.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.799
That's it. Time for bed. Come.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.919
But, Mama, it's Hanukkah!

03:27.920 --> 03:31.051
For you, every night is Hanukkah.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.039
Papa, enough already.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.965
They'll never get to sleep.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.087
All right. All right.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.399
Presents.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.079
What about presents?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.403
Presents? What presents?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.679
Oh, Papa.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.171
Just a joke.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.519
For Tanya, a new babushka.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.159
Happy Hanukkah.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.245
Oh, Papa. Thank you.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.639
You have only one parent?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.199
Thank you, Mama.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.479
Hmm.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.769
And for you, Fievel,

04:06.000 --> 04:07.399
a new hat.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.839
And not just any hat.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.119
A new hat that has
been in the family

04:11.120 --> 04:13.329
for three generations.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.559
It belonged to me, my father,
and my father's father,

04:17.560 --> 04:20.565
and now, it belongs to you.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.285
Happy Hanukkah.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.159
It's too big!

04:27.160 --> 04:29.519
You'll grow.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.439
Ah, did I ever tell you

04:32.440 --> 04:35.799
about the Giant Mouse of Minsk?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.770
No.
No.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.519
Was it anything like
the mouse with the long hair

04:40.520 --> 04:42.524
that the prince climbed up?

04:43.400 --> 04:46.883
No. This mouse, the Mouse of Minsk,

04:47.200 --> 04:48.999
was tall as a tree.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.246
His tail was a mile long.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.729
Really?
Really.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.759
He was so big,
he frightened all the cats.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.199
Shh!

05:00.200 --> 05:01.479
Don't say that word.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.479
Talk about something else.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.639
America.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.279
Another fairy tale.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.199
America.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.479
What a place!

05:09.480 --> 05:11.719
What a place!
What a place!

05:11.720 --> 05:15.079
In America, there are mouse
holes in every wall.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.959
Who says?
Everyone!

05:16.960 --> 05:20.119
In America, there are bread
crumbs on every floor!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.599
You're talking nonsense.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.239
In America, you can
say anything you want.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.799
But most important...

05:26.800 --> 05:28.919
And this I know for fact,

05:28.920 --> 05:32.085
in America, there are no cats.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.399
Shh. They'll hear you.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.086
How could they hear us?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.686
There, you see?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.763
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!

06:24.640 --> 06:26.160
Don't cry, Yasha.
I'll scare them away.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.079
Fievel, you'll get hurt!

06:33.480 --> 06:35.803
Go away!

06:38.000 --> 06:40.159
Go away, cats! Go away!

06:59.120 --> 07:00.521
Whoa!

07:01.040 --> 07:02.199
Whoa!

07:27.680 --> 07:30.686
Fievel, angel, are you all right?

07:30.920 --> 07:32.719
Yes, Mama.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.726
Then never do that again!

07:37.880 --> 07:39.645
Mama, look.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.290
In America,

07:50.520 --> 07:53.048
there are no cats.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.399
Look, Papa, water.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.239
Is it the ocean?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.239
Yes. Keep walking.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.359
Look, Papa, smoke!

08:45.360 --> 08:47.524
Is the boat on fire?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.559
No. No. Keep walking!

08:58.360 --> 09:01.359
Look, Papa, birds!

09:01.360 --> 09:03.199
Are they seagulls?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.279
Keep walking!

09:04.280 --> 09:05.359
Keep walking!

09:05.360 --> 09:06.999
Keep walking!

09:10.400 --> 09:12.479
I just wanted to see.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.119
Fievel, this is the last
time I take you to America.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.851
Bye-bye!

09:22.320 --> 09:24.999
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

09:25.000 --> 09:27.159
Ooh, <i>auf Wiedersehen!</i>

09:27.160 --> 09:29.159
You know I got a cousin in America.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.559
Ah!

09:30.560 --> 09:33.079
You and everybody else.
Huh?

09:53.840 --> 09:55.759
Are we there yet?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.079
Not yet. Soon.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.839
How soon?

09:59.840 --> 10:01.401
Soon.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.682
Maybe we should
have stayed in Russia.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.359
We'll be all right.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.764
As long as we're together,
we'll be all right.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.639
Ah, so, Mr. Curious,

10:36.640 --> 10:38.079
you've discovered the herring.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.759
Herring?
I thought they were fish.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.645
But, Fievel, herring are fish.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.679
Really?
Certainly.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.599
In the ocean,
there are all kinds of fish,

10:49.600 --> 10:51.399
and herring is one of them.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.639
All kinds?

10:52.640 --> 10:56.959
Yes. Tiny fishes,
not so tiny fishes,

10:56.960 --> 10:59.559
fishes as big as this boat.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.008
Wow!

11:02.560 --> 11:05.201
Let's go up and see the fish!

11:05.920 --> 11:08.368
Not now.
Your mama's worried.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.527
Come back, Fievel.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.079
Wait!

11:16.080 --> 11:18.279
Oh, what am I going to do with you?

11:18.280 --> 11:21.119
You stay closer to home!
Don't you go running off again!

11:21.120 --> 11:22.279
Mama!

11:22.280 --> 11:25.490
Ah, so we return, hmm?

11:26.320 --> 11:28.519
We saw some fish!

11:28.520 --> 11:30.079
Fish?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.439
Lucky you didn't see some cats.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.919
Cats!

11:35.280 --> 11:36.999
Cats!
Oh!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.528
I didn't see any cats.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.639
Whew.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.519
Won't it be nice to get to America

11:43.520 --> 11:47.083
where we don't have to worry
about cats anymore?

11:47.560 --> 11:50.611
There are no cats in America,

11:50.720 --> 11:53.646
but back home in mother Russia...

20:46.880 --> 20:49.799
I don't know. They were
on the boat to America.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.759
Ah! Then you are in luck,
my little immigrant.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.764
This is America!

20:55.960 --> 20:58.203
America.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.199
I thought it was bigger.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.250
Oh, it is bigger.

21:02.960 --> 21:07.879
All of that is also America.
Wow!

21:07.880 --> 21:10.319

an island at the doorway

21:30.200 --> 21:33.119
you want to find your family,

21:33.120 --> 21:34.759
and you will.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.119
But how?

21:36.120 --> 21:39.279
It's so far away, and it's so big!

21:39.280 --> 21:42.399
I'll never find them anyway.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.039
But did you say,

21:47.040 --> 21:48.359
"Never"?

So young, and you have lost hope.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.599
Ah, this is America,

21:53.600 --> 21:56.048
the place to find hope!

21:56.080 --> 21:59.723
If you give up, you will
never find your family.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.359

23:33.360 --> 23:35.719
You will find your family there.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.079
Everyone goes through immigration.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.679
I would take you there myself,

Come on, keep it

24:30.200 --> 24:31.559
All right.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.839
Hurry, hurry!

24:32.840 --> 24:36.359
Yes, sir! Step off the
boat and into prosperity!

24:36.360 --> 24:40.560
Welcome, greenhorns!
This is America!

24:40.680 --> 24:44.479
Today's special, the Brooklyn
Bridge, just a dollar!

24:44.480 --> 24:46.599
Golly, the Brooklyn Bridge!

24:46.600 --> 24:49.439
Ticket to Chicago!
Used only once!

24:50.520 --> 24:52.479
Gee whiz!
Only once, Ma.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.759
Apple, apple?
Get my apple while it lasts.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.839
Hurry, it's going fast!

24:57.840 --> 25:00.004
I'll take one!

25:02.360 --> 25:06.082
Eighteen, 19, 20, 21.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.599
Would you please put
out that filthy thing?

25:10.600 --> 25:11.759
I'm suffocating down here.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.159
You don't like it?

25:13.160 --> 25:16.559
Hey, you know you're not the
only cockroach in New York City.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.439
There are millions
of roaches who'd give

25:18.440 --> 25:21.320
their left feet to
work for Warren T. Rat.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.439
Good. Fire me!

25:22.440 --> 25:24.119
I'm fed up with that filthy smoke...
Hey!

25:24.120 --> 25:26.249
And this pocket!

25:26.600 --> 25:28.439
I've seen kitchen stoves
cleaner than this place.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.759
Hey, come on.
Look at my suit.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.639
All right, all right, Digit.
All right.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.639
Hey, how much money
did we make today?

25:34.640 --> 25:36.121
Oh.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.159
Oh, well. Well, let's see.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.719
Uh, seven, nine, four, six,
carry one, drop two.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.439
Uh, take five,
five down, seven up, 98.6...

25:42.440 --> 25:44.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.319
And two plus two is 22.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.399
What did we make?
What's the boodle?

25:49.400 --> 25:53.088
Oh, so far,
we have collected $89 and...

25:53.120 --> 25:55.399
And 13 cents. Uh-oh.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.959
And we'll get another 17 from Moe.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.199
Uh, that's 50 cents
less than yesterday.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.840
What?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.439
Fifty cents!

26:02.440 --> 26:04.639
I hate to lose money.

26:04.640 --> 26:09.204
Mmm. Where can I pick up
an extra 50 cents?

26:12.040 --> 26:13.159
Bye!

26:13.160 --> 26:15.639
<i>Au revoir,</i> my little immigrant!
Huh?

26:17.680 --> 26:19.159
Hmm. Hey, boss, a kid.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.559
Hmm. You know, Moe can always use
an extra kid at 50 cents a day.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.961
Yeah.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.811
Very interesting.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.081
Ahem! Well, well, well!

26:30.160 --> 26:32.927
Rat's the name, Warren T. Rat.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.879
What can I do you for, kid?

26:35.880 --> 26:37.839
I'm looking for my family.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.439
Hey, you come to
the right fellow, kid.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.519
I know exactly where they are.
Come with me.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.527
But Henri said I'd find them here!
Have it your way, kid.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.679
But remember what Shakespeare said.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.039
And I quote.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.359
"Opportunity knocks but..."
Uh... But, uh...

26:55.360 --> 26:56.479
Psst! Once!

26:56.480 --> 26:57.881
"But... But once!

26:58.080 --> 27:01.239
"Taken at the tide,
t'will lead to fortune.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.530
"If denied, t'will never return."

27:04.560 --> 27:07.399
Do you really know
where my family is?

27:10.240 --> 27:13.405
Trust me. Hey, trust me.

27:26.400 --> 27:30.439
Mama, I keep having this
feeling that Fievel's alive.

27:30.440 --> 27:34.049
Tanya, it will go away.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.490
After a while, it will go away.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.919
Come with me.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.051
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't break a gut there.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.239
"O! Pardon me,

28:00.920 --> 28:03.439
This is where they are.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.759
Papa!

28:10.240 --> 28:12.559
Not bad, huh, Moe?
A new worker.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.079
What about my family?

28:14.080 --> 28:17.439
You don't need a family, kid.
You got a job here!

28:17.440 --> 28:19.959
Just send me his salary, will you?

28:22.560 --> 28:25.964
And where do you
think you're going?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.799
You're mine! Now get to work!

28:28.800 --> 28:31.806
You! What are you looking at?
Back to work!

28:46.360 --> 28:47.999
I want to get out of here.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.959
You and me both.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.479
I have to find my family.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.359
Oh, shut up! Go to sleep.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.479
Pipe down.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.519
Oh, be quiet!

28:56.520 --> 28:59.639
I wish we had that
mouse with the long hair.

28:59.640 --> 29:03.639
She could drop her hair out the
window, and we can all climb down.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.319
Sure. Out the window.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.919
Oh, fairy tales!

29:06.920 --> 29:10.159
Wait a minute!
This kid may have something.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.399
Tony Toponi's the name.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.679
Put it there. Well, uh...

Just try!

Maybe he'll hear it.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.961
You can't find what's not there.

34:08.679 --> 34:12.208
Okay, okay.
I got it all figured out.

34:12.560 --> 34:16.089
We'll start looking for

34:18.960 --> 34:21.438
This is America.
Don't be afraid.

34:24.639 --> 34:28.203
Tony? Hey, Tony, where you going?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.039
I ask you this.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.199
Are we going to stand by

34:31.199 --> 34:34.649
and let cats wreck our homes,
our businesses and our lives?

34:35.360 --> 34:38.889
If we all got together, we could
do something about the cats!

34:39.280 --> 34:42.728
Yeah. We should all get together.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.839
This is America.
We have free speech.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.321
You can say "cat" here.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.167
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!

34:50.840 --> 34:53.399
Shh! Not so loud.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.879
Shh.
Please, not that word.

34:55.880 --> 34:59.409
Wait a minute. Come back!
Where are you going?

35:02.280 --> 35:03.727
Oh.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.639
So,

35:12.640 --> 35:14.929

35:34.280 --> 35:36.842

35:51.240 --> 35:53.599
But there are no cats in America.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.239
That does it.
I'm getting out of here!

35:55.240 --> 35:57.130
Mmm-hmm, me too.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.202
What are you all afraid of?
Cats, cats, cats, cats.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.359
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.569
There are no cats.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.124
Hey, you all right?

36:47.200 --> 36:50.239
I mean, you ain't
hurt or nothing, are you?

36:50.240 --> 36:52.079
No. No, I'm okay.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.999
Thank you.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.639
No, really, I'm all right.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.883
Really, I am.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.919
How about you?

36:59.920 --> 37:00.999
Nah!

37:01.000 --> 37:03.119
Who do those cats think they are?

37:03.120 --> 37:06.000
I'll show them
a thing or two next time.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.559
Hey, where's Fillie?

37:07.560 --> 37:09.079
Fillie? Who's Fillie?

37:09.080 --> 37:12.404
Oh, I gotta find him.
He's just a kid.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.206
Fillie!

37:19.960 --> 37:21.771
Tony!
Whoa!

37:22.480 --> 37:25.319
Phew! Hmm. Some scrap, huh?

37:25.320 --> 37:29.088
There are cats here.
Wait till I tell Papa!

37:29.760 --> 37:31.359
If I find him.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.079
You see,
he's looking for his family.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.050
Aw, the poor darling.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.199
Wait a minute!

37:38.200 --> 37:40.479
Honest John, at Tammany Hall.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.039
He'll know where your family is.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.559
He will?

37:43.560 --> 37:47.759
Tony, he knows every mouse in the city!
Ha! Told you to stick with me, yeah?

37:47.760 --> 37:49.366
Come on.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.519
Oh!

37:53.520 --> 37:57.679
Well, Mr. There Are
No Whats in America?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.206
Mmm?

37:59.480 --> 38:01.644
Cats.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.409
It's me third wake today,
and I'm not finished.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.839
We've got to do
something about them cats.

38:17.480 --> 38:22.841
Besides paying Warren T. Rat
for no protection.

38:24.880 --> 38:28.239
Oh, oh, poor lad.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.479
So young.

38:29.480 --> 38:32.247
He never had a chance to vote.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.566
Well, he'll vote from now on.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.889
I'll see to that.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.319
Honest John.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.399
It's Gussie Mausheimer!

38:47.400 --> 38:48.801
Oh.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.729
Ooh-whee, the richest and most
powerful mouse in New York.

38:53.800 --> 38:57.329
What's she doing
slumming in this part of town?

38:59.760 --> 39:01.959
There's a dead mouse on that table.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.966
It's an Irish custom, Gussie.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.079
The cats got him today.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.279
Precisely why I am here to see you.

39:10.280 --> 39:13.843
Would you care for a wee
drop of the creature?

39:14.920 --> 39:17.079
Today was the worst ever.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.599
Those cats are killing everyone!

39:19.600 --> 39:23.199
They don't even know the
difference between rich and poor.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.279
The wretches!

39:24.280 --> 39:26.759
Oh, shameful!

39:26.760 --> 39:29.599
As you know,
I have dedicated my life

39:29.600 --> 39:33.482
to helping those less
fortunate than myself.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.439
Uh, that's everyone.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.571
And now I want you to help me.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.639
We must have a wawwy.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.519
A wawwy? What's a wawwy?

39:43.520 --> 39:45.843
You know, a wawwy.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.039
A large gathering
of mice for a reason.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.919
Oh, a rally!

39:52.920 --> 39:56.051
That's what I said, a wawwy.

40:00.160 --> 40:04.399
Tomorrow at Mausheimer Park,
we will all decide what to do.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.279
I'll bring the uptown mice

40:06.280 --> 40:09.239
and you bring
the mice from downtown.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.804
Madam,
you can count on Honest John.

40:18.040 --> 40:21.479
At last, we're all getting
together about the cats.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.719
Bridget.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.239
Oh, Fillie.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.759
Honest John, he's lost his family.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.999
By any chance, do you
know the Mousekewitzes?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.639
Oh, hmm.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.771
Are they registered to vote?

40:34.840 --> 40:36.439
They just got off the boat.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.763
Oh.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.039
Sorry, don't know them yet.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.359
That's my mother and father.

40:55.360 --> 40:59.128
The cats got them
two years ago November.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.399
Now, don't you worry.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.159
Yours are all right.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.164
And they're out there somewhere.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.440
Now.
Get some sleep.

<i>You all know why we are here.</i>

43:39.480 --> 43:42.559
<i>We have got to do something
about these cats.</i>

43:44.040 --> 43:45.919
Not so loud! They'll hear you!

43:45.920 --> 43:47.719
<i>So?
Let them hear me.</i>

43:47.720 --> 43:49.359
You can talk!
You're rich!

43:51.040 --> 43:53.079
<i>Money is not everything.</i>

43:53.080 --> 43:56.719
I know, because I have money
and I have everything,

43:56.720 --> 43:59.399
<i>but what are they
worth without freedom?</i>

43:59.400 --> 44:00.879
Hear, hear!

44:00.880 --> 44:02.239
Yeah! Right!

44:02.240 --> 44:05.086
<i>Why did we come to America?</i>

44:05.280 --> 44:06.879
For freedom!

44:08.360 --> 44:10.959
Why are they building that statue?

44:10.960 --> 44:13.359
What does it stand for?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.966
Freedom!

44:15.880 --> 44:18.199
So what do we want?

44:18.200 --> 44:20.523
Freedom!

44:25.320 --> 44:26.679
Right!

44:26.680 --> 44:28.959
<i>Freedom from cats.</i>

44:28.960 --> 44:32.879
And because this is America, we
can do something about them!

44:32.880 --> 44:34.119
What do we do?

44:35.360 --> 44:37.239
Papa, I can't see.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.130
They're bigger than we are!

44:39.200 --> 44:41.759
<i>Not if we all work together.</i>

44:41.760 --> 44:44.322
What are you afraid of?

44:44.400 --> 44:47.919
Are we men, or are we mice?

44:47.920 --> 44:49.279
Mice!

44:49.280 --> 44:53.002
Mice, indeed, and proud of it!

44:56.080 --> 45:00.610
So, what are we going to do
about those cats?

45:02.280 --> 45:03.841
Well?

45:03.960 --> 45:05.279
Any ideas?

45:05.280 --> 45:06.319
Ahem.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.799
Oh, yes, well, I...

45:08.800 --> 45:10.804
Oh, dear.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.119
I have an idea.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.599
Yes?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.679
Hmm.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.443
What did he say?

45:23.480 --> 45:25.399
Uh, he, he said, uh...

45:25.400 --> 45:27.564
Uh-huh.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.199
Hmm...

45:29.200 --> 45:31.489
Ohh.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.842
Yes. Cute little fellow.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.799
Wait a minute.

45:36.800 --> 45:41.439
I think this little fellow
has got something here.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.159
We have a plan!

45:47.000 --> 45:50.210
Oh, Papa.
She's in the way again!

46:37.320 --> 46:39.370
Look out below!

46:44.720 --> 46:46.039
Shh!

46:46.040 --> 46:51.810
We have a plan!
<i>E pluribus unum!</i>

47:34.600 --> 47:35.919
Ladies and gentlemen,

47:35.920 --> 47:39.608
I want to thank you so much
for your participation.

47:40.520 --> 47:44.519
And I want to close by saying,
that a vote for Honest John

47:44.520 --> 47:46.599
is a vote for freedom!

47:46.600 --> 47:48.439
Freedom is what it is!

47:48.440 --> 47:52.208
And thank you again, one and all!

47:55.440 --> 47:57.359
Holy spumoni!

47:57.360 --> 48:00.039
We should have been at
the pier an hour ago!

48:00.040 --> 48:01.839
The pier?

48:01.840 --> 48:04.049
That's a scary place!

48:04.120 --> 48:07.079
I promised Bridget we'd be on time.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.323
Wait for me! Wait!

48:09.600 --> 48:12.319
Geez Louise, am I in the doghouse!

48:12.320 --> 48:14.722
Pick 'em up!

48:15.480 --> 48:17.159
Tell me what time it was, huh?

48:17.160 --> 48:20.006
But, Tony, I can't tell time!

48:20.960 --> 48:24.479
Tony, slow down! Wait!

48:24.480 --> 48:26.405
Wait!

48:33.320 --> 48:35.051
Papa?

48:36.680 --> 48:38.199
Tony!

48:38.200 --> 48:39.840
Papa!

48:41.120 --> 48:43.921
I'm coming, Papa!

49:31.120 --> 49:32.851
Papa?

49:48.800 --> 49:51.851
All right, ante up, boys.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.044
Hey, no cheating.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.286
Hmm.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.599
Ooh! I got it! I got it!

50:09.600 --> 50:12.039
I got it!

50:12.040 --> 50:14.727
Rummy!

50:14.800 --> 50:19.524
Tiger, for the hundredth time,
we're playing poker.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.605
I knew that. I knew that.

50:22.640 --> 50:26.679
But who can concentrate with
all that, you know, noise?

50:27.920 --> 50:29.526
Hey, Tiger.

50:30.600 --> 50:34.119
When the boss plays, it's culture.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.119
Sure, culture.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.683
I think it sounds, uh, melodious.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.124
"If music be the food of love,

50:42.280 --> 50:45.843
"play on, McDuff, play on."

50:46.640 --> 50:50.639
Oh, I don't know which is
worse, the music or the Shakespeare.

50:50.640 --> 50:54.319
Rats! This nose, this nose
here keeps getting in the way!

50:54.320 --> 50:56.119
You... You could stop playing.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.799
That's funny.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.879
I've never known a
cockroach with good taste.

51:00.960 --> 51:04.719
But, I've known plenty that taste...

51:04.720 --> 51:05.999
Good.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.890
Play, play, play!

51:08.000 --> 51:10.129
Ahem. Hmm.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.199
Warren T!

51:23.720 --> 51:24.999
You!

51:25.000 --> 51:27.599
You're not a rat!
You're a cat!

51:27.600 --> 51:29.959
How did you get in here?
Come here, you little...

51:34.080 --> 51:36.839
Gentlemen, cat's out of the bag!

51:38.240 --> 51:40.130
Get me that mouse!

51:40.400 --> 51:41.959
Let me at him.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.599
I mean, let me at him.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.439
I'll kill him! Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

51:46.440 --> 51:49.286
You just stepped on my tail!

52:01.680 --> 52:03.605
Come here, you little runt!

52:09.040 --> 52:10.805
Get him!

52:15.680 --> 52:17.445
Get him!

53:00.440 --> 53:01.879
Once more.

53:01.880 --> 53:03.919
There is the boat.

53:03.920 --> 53:07.719
The boat whistle blows
at 6:00 in the morning,

53:07.720 --> 53:11.359
and that is when we must release

53:11.360 --> 53:14.199
the secret weapon!

53:25.480 --> 53:28.319
So, the cats must be here

53:28.320 --> 53:31.199
at 6:00 on the dot,

53:31.200 --> 53:34.279
not a moment before or after.

53:34.280 --> 53:37.479
Now, when you go to get the cats,

53:37.480 --> 53:40.359
what do you do to
make them come here?

53:41.600 --> 53:43.759
Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.079
Right!

53:45.080 --> 53:46.839
Now get some sleep.

53:46.840 --> 53:50.403
We have a long day ahead.

53:51.440 --> 53:54.399
No, no, no.
Boss, it was not me.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.679
I promise, that wasn't me.

53:57.880 --> 53:59.079
Wake up.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.482
Uh, wake up.

54:01.960 --> 54:04.931
Jake! Wake up.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.519
You're up.
Uh, go get some sleep, Jake.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.480
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Rest, sleep.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.599
On your guard, Tiger!

54:19.520 --> 54:20.999
Don't make any funny moves.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.679
'Cause I'm crafty, and I'm quick.

54:23.680 --> 54:26.279
I have the instinct of a cat.
What am I saying?

54:26.280 --> 54:27.519
I am a cat!

54:27.520 --> 54:29.999
Oh, hey, now don't start that.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.079
I didn't mean to scare
you that much, really.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.199
It's okay, little buddy.
Hey, I'm your friend.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.683
Aw, come on.
Be happy.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.039
Aw.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.519
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?

54:42.520 --> 54:45.199
I can't get out of
here and I have to,

54:45.200 --> 54:47.959
so I can find my family.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.559
You lost your family?

54:50.560 --> 54:52.039
Mmm-hmm.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.079
Oh, no.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.399
That's terrible.

54:55.400 --> 54:58.959
You know, I lost my family, too.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.959
Years ago, I mean.

55:00.960 --> 55:05.126
Eight brothers...
Ten sisters...

55:06.160 --> 55:08.289
Three fathers...

55:10.080 --> 55:11.639
Don't cry.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.359
You'll find them.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.331
Do you really think so?

55:18.000 --> 55:20.279
Gee, you're nice.

55:20.280 --> 55:23.079
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?

55:23.080 --> 55:26.399
Fievel, Fievel Mousekewitz.

55:26.400 --> 55:28.245
Oh, dear.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.399
Listen. I like mice.

55:31.960 --> 55:33.719
Oh, no, not like that.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.679
I mean, I don't eat
red meat at all.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.759
I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.519
Oh, a little fish now and then.

55:41.520 --> 55:44.239
But what I really
like is some nice... Shh...

55:44.240 --> 55:46.759
Broccoli.

55:46.760 --> 55:50.559
You know, I thought all cats
were supposed to be mean.

55:50.560 --> 55:54.123
Mean? Ha!
I am mean!

55:55.320 --> 55:59.884
Then... And...
Aw, what's the use?

56:09.520 --> 56:12.199
I like butterflies
with big golden wings

56:12.200 --> 56:14.921
and blue and green tips.

56:14.960 --> 56:16.279
Me, too!

56:16.280 --> 56:18.199
Yeah? Ha.

56:18.200 --> 56:20.319
I like Swiss cheese ice cream.

56:20.320 --> 56:21.719
Me, too! Me, too!

56:21.720 --> 56:23.639
You too, too? Hmm.

56:23.640 --> 56:26.359
Wait a minute.
What's your favorite book?

56:26.360 --> 56:28.719
Um, <i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i>

56:28.720 --> 56:30.959
<i>The Brothers...</i>
I can't believe it.

56:30.960 --> 56:34.250

58:44.080 --> 58:46.767
Oh, stop it! Uh! Oh!

58:47.760 --> 58:48.999
Tiger, how did he get away?

58:49.000 --> 58:50.119
He overpowered me.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.239
You're fired.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.971
Good. I'm glad.

58:53.440 --> 58:54.959
I never liked you,

58:54.960 --> 58:58.170
and besides, your music stinks.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.642
Tony! Help!

59:11.920 --> 59:14.448
Help! Cats!

59:16.560 --> 59:19.645
Tony, Bridget, help!

59:19.800 --> 59:21.159
Cats!

59:21.160 --> 59:22.919
It's the cats!

59:22.920 --> 59:24.159
Help!

59:24.160 --> 59:25.559
Oh, they're early!

59:25.560 --> 59:29.169
Wake up! Everybody, wake up!

59:33.560 --> 59:35.159
Cats!

59:35.160 --> 59:36.721
Help!

59:38.240 --> 59:39.799
Wake up! The cats are here!

59:41.240 --> 59:43.319
Wake up!

59:43.320 --> 59:44.959
Cats!

59:44.960 --> 59:46.919
The cats!

59:46.920 --> 59:49.359
Release the secret weapon!

59:49.360 --> 59:52.240
What? Release the... Oh, no!

59:56.760 --> 59:58.119
Oh, no! Oh, no!

59:58.120 --> 59:59.679
Oh, no! No, no!

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.359
Wait for the boat whistle!

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.762
Hold your fire.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.239
It's that rat, Warren T.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.199
He's not a rat.
He's a cat.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.679
He's their boss.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.079
Pay no attention to
that little mouse.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.879
Just throw down all your
money and that kid.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.319
And I will personally convince
these cats to leave you alone.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.688
You're wrecking the plan!

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.441
It's not supposed
to happen this way!

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.879
Just throw down that kid!

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.964
Oh. yeah?

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.919
Bull's eye!

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.679
Disregard the nose.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.239
What's in a nose?

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.999
A nose by any other name
would smell as sweet...

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.879
Great whiskers, it's a cat!

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.089
He's a cat!

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.079
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.559
Who are you going to believe,
me or your own eyes?

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.969
Release the secret...
No, no!

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.039
Hey, easy, easy!

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.239
All right. Then, I take
it we can't do business.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.999
Warren, you're through.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.759
Washed up, ruined!

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.559
You'll never get another cent

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.639
from any mouse, anywhere.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.359
Eh? We'll see about that.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.445
Just wait, you little rat.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.039
Just wait.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.884
<i>Adiós!</i>
Fire!

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.319
Oh! Tie it Off! Hurry!

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.844
Oh, saints be praised.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.767
It stopped.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.365
Release the secret weapon!

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.319
Release? Oh, no!

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.399
Release the secret weapon!

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.279
Make up your mind!

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.648
Ooh, ooh! My goodness!

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.126
Release the secret weapon!

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.319
Release the weapon!

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.486
Release the blasted weapon!

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.079
Faster, papa.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.845
We can't do business here, huh?

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.051
Release the secret weapon!

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.288
Faster!

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.599
Get a load of that.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.439
It's the Giant Mouse of Minsk!

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.968
Oh, you're right.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.081
Yay!

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.484
Head for the pier!

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.799
We did it!

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.919
Whoa!

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.079
They can't swim!

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
credit where it's due.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.724
We owe it all to Fillie
and his Mouse of Minsk!

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.479
<i>♪ Now there are no
cats in America... ♪</i>

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.639
Fillie! Who's Fillie?

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.639
Someday,
Gussie Mausheimer, someday!

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.439
And you, too, Mousekewitz.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.003
All of you! I hate mice!

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.086
I'm having a heart attack here.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.359
Oh, don't worry,
gentlemen. Don't worry.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.519
There are plenty of
mice in Hong Kong.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.439
Oh, my! I'll have to learn
to calculate in Chinese.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.401
Hmm. Let me see, uh.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.970
Hey, I wonder how you
say "trust me" in Chinese.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.199
The pier's on fire!

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.999
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Bring that hose over here.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.559
You there, come on!

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.086
Fillie!

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.359
Fillie Mousekewitz!

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.999
Where are you?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.879
Tony, look.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.248
Fievel!

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.759
Fillie!

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.919
Papa, listen.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.799
Fillie Mousekewitz!

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.399
Ah, so what? Someone is
calling a Fillie Mousekewitz.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.639
They changed my name to Tilly.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.799
Maybe they changed Fievel's
name to Fillie.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.879
Come on, Papa. Just got to see.
Wait!

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.439
Stop! Stop!

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.205
Hurry. Hurry!

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.119
Fillie Mousekewitz!

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.919
Fillie!

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.679
Wait!

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.162
Stop! om

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.359
You are calling for
a Fillie Mousekewitz, right?

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.130
Here, tell my daughter his
name is Fillie and not Fievel.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.919
His name is Fillie.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.279
You see?

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.399
And Fievel.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.279
And Fievel?

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.799
Papa.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.839
No, no, no, there are many Fievel
Mousekewitzes in New York.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.639
Maybe thousands.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.329
It could still be
another Fievel Mousekewitz.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.723
No, Papa.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.844
Look.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.198
Get a load of this, huh.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.879
Hey, kid,
you're sleeping in my place.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.078
Huh?

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.959
Hey, give me that!
Got any food on you?

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.559
Hey, what's your story?

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.799
I've been looking for my family.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.441
Hey, fellows, he's
looking for his family.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.038
He's looking for his family!

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.078
I stopped that a long time ago.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.879
At least you know who they are.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.959
Yeah!

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.078
Why are you looking for them?
They should be looking for you.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.687
They don't care.
Forget them.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.399
You're right, they don't care!

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.439
And if they did,
they would have found me.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.158
Well, if they don't care,
I don't care!

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.040
I don't care if I
never see them again.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.879
Yeah, you're nothing.
You're junk, you're trash.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.162
Here.
Make yourself a bed.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.679
I'll never find them again anyway.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.608
Never

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.890
This is my home now.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.326
Fievel!

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.891
Fievel!

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.765
Fievel!

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.039
Fillie!

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.205
Hey, Fillie Mousekewitz!

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.719
I never dreamt this morning
I would be riding a feline.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.079
A feline?

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.399
A cat!

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.519
I knew that. I knew that.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.959
Keep playing. Keep playing.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.771
We will find him.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.647
Fievel!

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.919
Fievel!

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.641
Fievel, where are you?

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.367
Fievel?

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.049
Fievel?

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.484
Papa?

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.165
Papa?

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.483
Papa.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.839
Fievel?

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.844
Papa!

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.648
Where are you?

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.399
Papa!

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.724
Fiev... Wait, stop!

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.403
Fievel!

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.048
I'm coming, Papa!

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.119
Fievel!

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.124
Papa!

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.559
Fievel.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.919
Fievel!

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.926
Mama, look!

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.363
Mama!

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.959
What's come over me?

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.522
I am hugging a cat.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.319
I've never been so
happy in my life.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.725
I have friends,
lots of little tiny friends.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.083
Oh, Tony, isn't it grand?

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.639
Say, I don't hear no
one thanking me here.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.281
Oh!

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.889
Fievel, I knew
you were alive. I knew it!

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.530
Oh, my little boy
back from the dead.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.839
America. Hmm.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.607
What a place.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.079
My Fievel.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.519
I thought I would
never see you again.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.839
Never say never, Papa.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.999
Oh!

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.399
Oh! I nearly forgot.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.770
Here, Fievel, your hat.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.239
Your hat... It fits.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.359
My son.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.684
Now, you are a mouse.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.966
My statue is finished.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.199
Wait till you see her.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:26.528
She is beautiful.
<i>Magnifique.</i>

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.329
Mama, look, don't be afraid
to open your eyes.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.599
Look what you're missing.
You're missing everything.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.519
Papa, when we land, I'll look.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.879
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.399
No, whoa!
This is... Oh, whoa, whoa!

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.559
Oh, oh, this is nice.
Oh, thanks, fellas.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.168
I appreciate you coming back for me.
You in the front, higher, higher!

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.809
Whoa!

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.719
Oh, Henri, she's so beautiful.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.690
Wow.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.919
Henri, what's that over there?

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.971
Oh, that is more America.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.879
Can we go see it?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.719
You will, my little American.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.124
Someday, you will.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.447
Bye, bye.
