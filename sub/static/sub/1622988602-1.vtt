They say magic, you know,

11:28.563 --> 11:30.107
it’s not like pulling
a rabbit out of a hat,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.109
but it’s magic,
if you think about it.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.861

11:35.904 --> 11:38.073
I know, you guys are speechless

11:38.156 --> 11:41.034

11:52.587 --> 11:54.714
All right, well...

11:54.798 --> 11:56.258
you want to talk
about something else,

11:56.341 --> 11:59.219
let’s talk about something else.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.513
What gets you excited?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.890
Anybody.
What do you want to talk about?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.687
Anyone?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.025
Really? Anyone.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.652
Anyone in the class
besides Martin?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.530
Class, what does Martin want
to talk about?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.323
ALL:
Ancient volcanoes.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.992
Ancient volcanoes.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.369
Volcanoes are
nature’s fury, guys.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.247
Yes, which you demonstrated
graphically

12:27.330 --> 12:28.748
at the last science fair.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.958
What’s the point?

12:30.041 --> 12:32.586
-What’s the point of what?
-Anything.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.588
School, grades, college--
it’s all bullshit.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.049
Yeah. We’ve seen
the new number projections.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.012
We lose, period.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.972
The aliens kill us all.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.849
Those are numbers
from the year 2051.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.310
-That’s 30 years from now.
-JAYDEN: So?

of people every week.

that the world needs right now,

13:07.162 --> 13:09.331
it’s scientists.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.044

14:03.843 --> 14:05.804

Oh, a seat belt. Okay.

Mr. Forester?

1:02:17.693 --> 1:02:19.695

that’s all I’ve been doing

1:02:19.778 --> 1:02:21.905
since I got here, but okay.

1:02:23.073 --> 1:02:25.242
What is that?
That’s not what I saw in Miami.

1:02:25.325 --> 1:02:27.411
No, the ones that you fought
in Miami were the males.

1:02:27.494 --> 1:02:29.413
This is a female.

1:02:29.496 --> 1:02:32.040
She’s very aggressive
and much more rare.

1:02:32.124 --> 1:02:33.459
They typically nest underground,

1:02:33.542 --> 1:02:34.918
and the males are
fiercely protective.

1:02:35.002 --> 1:02:36.503
They would die to defend her.

1:02:36.587 --> 1:02:39.465
All they seem to care about is
the survival of the species.

1:02:46.138 --> 1:02:47.973
He’s gonna be joining us
for the extraction.

1:02:48.056 --> 1:02:49.683
He’s gonna need full armor.

1:02:49.766 --> 1:02:51.977
The toxin kills the males
just fine.

1:02:52.060 --> 1:02:53.604
It makes quite a mess of them,
actually.

1:02:53.687 --> 1:02:55.731
But when we sent a team in
to clean out the nests,

1:02:55.814 --> 1:02:59.359
we found dozens of dead males
and her.

1:02:59.443 --> 1:03:01.653
DAN: So the females
survive the toxin.

1:03:01.737 --> 1:03:03.447
And now you want to find out
why it didn’t kill her?

That’s why we sedated her.

1:18:27.161 --> 1:18:30.581
Gave her 180 milligrams
of hydromorphone.

1:18:30.665 --> 1:18:32.917

1:18:44.470 --> 1:18:46.848
The toxin still affects them,

1:18:46.931 --> 1:18:50.560
but for some reason, her body is
much better at detoxifying it.

1:18:50.643 --> 1:18:52.019
So you just got to figure out

1:18:52.103 --> 1:18:53.855
what she’s using
to attack the toxin.

1:18:53.938 --> 1:18:57.191
You can design an enzyme
inhibitor to neutralize it.

1:18:57.275 --> 1:18:59.068
And then we can kill them all.

1:44:37.355 --> 1:44:39.065
Thanks.

1:44:42.402 --> 1:44:44.153
Check this out.

1:44:44.237 --> 1:44:46.072
This is the largest glacier
in Russia.

1:44:46.155 --> 1:44:48.449
Scientists doing
deep drill experiments there

1:44:48.533 --> 1:44:51.452
found volcanic ash
at a depth of 400 meters,

1:44:51.536 --> 1:44:54.580
a depth consistent
with the average snowfall

1:44:54.664 --> 1:44:57.000
since the year 946 A.D.

1:44:57.083 --> 1:44:59.210
But to get ash
in the claws, I mean,

1:44:59.293 --> 1:45:02.171
they would have to dig through
a thousand years of ice.

1:45:03.423 --> 1:45:05.341
They didn’t dig down.
They dug up.

1:45:05.425 --> 1:45:07.051
That’s why there’s
no sign of impact.

1:45:07.135 --> 1:45:09.345
BOTH: They’ve been here
the whole time.

1:45:10.388 --> 1:45:12.849
Why wait a thousand years
to dig out?

1:45:12.932 --> 1:45:16.019
Martin, can you bring up an
ice melt projection for Russia?

1:45:16.102 --> 1:45:20.231
Yeah, polar ice melt, uh,
Russia, 2023 to 2048.

1:45:20.314 --> 1:45:21.482

There it is.

They didn’t wait it out.

1:45:22.900 --> 1:45:25.069

1:45:28.281 --> 1:45:30.199
We have to get to Russia.

1:45:30.283 --> 1:45:33.119
(laughs):
No. You’re not going to Russia.

1:45:33.202 --> 1:45:35.663
-But that’s where they are.
-Well, we think.

1:45:35.747 --> 1:45:37.832
No, we know.
That has to be where they are.

1:45:37.915 --> 1:45:39.250
Have any proof?

1:45:39.333 --> 1:45:40.793
We have to go there
to get the proof.

1:45:40.877 --> 1:45:43.755
Listen, if we can go there now
and kill them all,

1:45:43.838 --> 1:45:45.840
we prevent this from ever
happening, you understand?

1:45:45.923 --> 1:45:48.176
We’ve lost all contact
with the future, Forester.

1:45:48.259 --> 1:45:50.261
President just placed
the armed forces on high alert.

1:45:50.344 --> 1:45:52.221

1:45:58.644 --> 1:46:01.647
And-and you want me to use
taxpayer money

1:46:01.731 --> 1:46:05.401

into a hostile sovereign nation,

1:46:05.485 --> 1:46:07.487

1:46:25.379 --> 1:46:27.340
Excuse me.

1:46:27.423 --> 1:46:29.550
Well, I hate to say
I told you so,

1:46:29.634 --> 1:46:31.594
but people just hate
spending money on research.

1:46:31.677 --> 1:46:34.013

ourselves. How about that, huh?

1:46:34.097 --> 1:46:35.640
No, Russia’s closed its borders.

1:46:35.723 --> 1:46:37.809

1:46:39.602 --> 1:46:41.938
