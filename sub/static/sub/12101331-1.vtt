01:07.942 --> 01:09.319
Tom, it's Carlos.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.570
Been texting you all day, man.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.906
We need to pay rent and I need your share.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.324
Please call me back. Thanks.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.488
Dude, I see your room is empty.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.241
Why?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.242
Please call me back.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.801
- Hey, how are ya?

02:16.010 --> 02:17.262
You're lookin' good.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.515
Put on some weight since last year, huh?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.017
- That was three years ago.

02:25.103 --> 02:25.937
I got it.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.119
- You remember Chloe?

02:46.499 --> 02:49.502
- Yeah. Went to high school together.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.797
- We did more than that.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.217
- Got your old room all set up.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.094
Let me show you-
- I know where it is.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.431
- Okay. Let's go.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.117
- Why don't you rest up
and we could talk later.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.078
- Cool.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.081
- And Chloe, finish that assignment

03:27.081 --> 03:29.167
and I'll check it out tonight.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.001
- Yes, sir.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.378
- Oh yeah, one more thing.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.589
Look at me.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.429
- What the hell was that?

03:44.015 --> 03:45.516
- So how long you in town for?

03:48.353 --> 03:49.687
- A week, maybe two.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.648
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.899
- I work at the Rusty Tavern,

03:52.899 --> 03:55.485
so better stop by before you leave.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.611
- I will, I will.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.865
- You smile just like your dad.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.077
- I don't do a damn thing like my father.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.872
- You still have beef with him?

04:07.872 --> 04:09.916
For what?

04:09.916 --> 04:13.086
'Cause ya know that grudge,
that hurts you, too,

04:13.086 --> 04:14.045
not just him.

04:14.045 --> 04:18.508
- Look, all I'm sayin' is I'm
not my, I'm just not my dad.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.052
- Well ya can't just throw
him away like an old boot.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.055
He's in your blood,
whether you like it or not.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.348
- I'm gonna certainly try.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.853
- Look, I'm just saying

04:30.853 --> 04:33.564
to keep an open mind, amigo, that's it.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.695
Ya know people, they don't
hold on to bitterness

04:38.695 --> 04:40.029
and anger for no reason.

04:41.864 --> 04:42.699
Think about it.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.618
Hasta luego, cowboy.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.509
- So, what was it like
growing up with him, man?

05:01.509 --> 05:02.927
I mean, he could have gone anywhere

05:02.927 --> 05:04.387
and yet he chooses this farm?

05:05.763 --> 05:07.098
He's like a cowboy Einstein.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.891
I mean, you're so lucky.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.977
- Whatever you say, man.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.522
- Look right into that.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.693
- Serious?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.527
- Go ahead.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.540
- Nice.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.375
- This is new. Can I try it out, too?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.300
Crown prince has arrived. After you.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.760
- Look, man, I'm only
here 'cause he's promised

05:43.760 --> 05:46.054
to pay me for some stupid experiment.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.765
You and him, way more in
common than I ever had, okay?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.355
- Remember the last time you were here?

05:56.731 --> 05:59.442
It was just a fan and a laptop.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.738
Look at this place now.

06:05.323 --> 06:10.286
MIT, Caltech, Stanford, nowhere
near what I'm doin' here.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.665
Why don't you explain to him what we do.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.876
You know what we do here, right?

06:17.752 --> 06:19.170
- Nope.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.296
- Backup and restore.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.091
Okay, like, you know on a computer

06:23.091 --> 06:24.717
where you can backup and restore?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.512
- Yeah, copy the data, if you get a virus

06:27.512 --> 06:30.098
or somethin' like that,
you can fix the computer.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.933
- Only we fix brains here.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.480
- So, this machine right
here, it's called a Scammer.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.400
It digitally scans your brain
and creates a backup, so,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.110
God forbid you lose your memory,

06:42.110 --> 06:43.820
we can restore it from the backup.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.114
- Memory loss.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.079
Terrible thing.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.217
Can you imagine looking at your child

07:06.217 --> 07:08.302
and not knowin' who it is?

07:11.931 --> 07:12.890
The horror of that?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.020
Worse than death.

07:20.022 --> 07:20.857
- To some.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.653
- You wanted to try this?

07:25.653 --> 07:28.364
- It's what I'm here for, isn't it?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.045
- Here, take this.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.592
It'll calm your brain down.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.344
- And it'll make recording easier.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.145
- Let's get started.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.107
- Okay, so what you're gonna-

08:03.107 --> 08:04.567
- Don't bother, okay, man.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.195
The quicker we start,
the quicker I get paid.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.162
- Let's get you set up here.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.665
Keep your head still, please.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.375
- You guys are sure this is safe, right?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.253
- Yeah, 100%.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.297
Okay, we're set.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.389
- You see this?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.977
This is your brain in digital form.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.116
- So, Dr. Davis, now
that the backup's done,

09:35.116 --> 09:37.159
should we show him how the restore works?

09:37.159 --> 09:37.994
- Not tonight.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.302
Look, I'm gonna go over
to the Rusty Tavern.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.428
Why don't we get a drink?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.513
I'd like to talk to you about your mother.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.771
- Hey, Dr. Davis, I was wondering

10:05.771 --> 10:08.316
if I could get access to the lab again?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.692
- After what you did?

10:11.527 --> 10:12.361
Let's go.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.724
- Good boy. Go.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.562
Are you ready?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.694
- I'm not sure about this, man.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.615
- You know what's in his bag, right?

11:10.419 --> 11:13.756
Your Highness here is
your ticket to eternity

11:14.799 --> 11:17.134
in three, two,

11:18.094 --> 11:19.595
one.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.729
It's okay, it's okay.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.107
Please sit down, sit down. Don't worry.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.111
It will take two hours to
back up your entire brain,

11:35.111 --> 11:36.612
then all we need to do
is find a younger body

11:36.612 --> 11:38.364
and upload your backup.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.991
Then it will be smooth
sailing for another 50 years.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.203
Whose car is that out there?

11:44.203 --> 11:48.165
- Dr. Davis I was not
expecting you back so soon.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.625
- Who the hell is this?

11:50.501 --> 11:51.627
- Dr. Davis, listen,

11:52.712 --> 11:55.548
this man is about to pay a
million dollars for the Mint.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.758
- You're sellin' my research?

11:57.758 --> 11:58.676
Get these assholes outta here.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.386
Get out. Let's go.
- Imagine the research

12:00.386 --> 12:01.220
- You gotta go.
- we could do.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.054
Let's go.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.014
And you, I want you off my property.

12:04.014 --> 12:04.849
- Out, I want you

12:04.849 --> 12:05.683
off my property.
- Dr. Davis.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.726
Dr. Davis, please listen.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.310
- Go!

12:08.310 --> 12:10.771
Go, get out.

12:12.106 --> 12:17.111
Bruno! Bruno!

12:57.693 --> 12:58.569
This is the Mint.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.030
- Short for Memory Interpreter.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.788
It will
completely restore memory.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.706
- All right, let me see if I got this.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.167
Scammer records the memory
onto the little noggin

13:13.167 --> 13:15.503
and then the Mint plays it back.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.588
Okay, what are we testing?

13:17.588 --> 13:18.422
- The hold time.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.927
- The problem is it only
holds for 15 minutes.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.304
- What happens after 15 minutes?

13:25.304 --> 13:28.098
- Your brain returns to
its pre-restored state.

13:28.098 --> 13:28.933
- What?

13:30.559 --> 13:31.393
- Look.

13:35.940 --> 13:40.402
This is your neuro structure
before restore, okay?

13:40.402 --> 13:45.407
Now, after you load your
backup, it changes like this.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.036
Right?

13:50.037 --> 13:53.415
But it's only gonna hold for
a limited amount of time.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.708
- 900 seconds.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.085
- Which is about 15 minutes.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.339
Then it's gonna go back
to its original state.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.842
- So, you just go back to the beginning.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.759
- Exactly.

14:06.512 --> 14:11.517
Now, what I wanna do is avoid a return

14:11.600 --> 14:13.936
to that original state
for as long as possible.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.690
One more thing.

14:20.985 --> 14:25.990
I'm gonna need you to log down
everything you do on this.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.700
Okay?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.285
- Okay.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.877
- Let's get you set up.

15:34.725 --> 15:39.730
- This is Tom Davis.
It's June 5th, 7:45 pm.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.025
Current hold time is three hours.

15:43.025 --> 15:47.071
CRUMS are 5%.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.614
- Dude, we did it.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.366
We did it, man.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.159
- Yeah, we did it.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.369
- We did shit!

15:56.789 --> 15:58.457
This is changing history.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.710
- Get out.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.544
- Look, I haven't-

16:02.544 --> 16:03.462
- Get out!

16:18.477 --> 16:19.687
- Hey, where's my money?

16:22.481 --> 16:23.899
You promised you would
pay me after two weeks.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.317
- Yeah, not for a shit result.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.777
- That's not my problem, now is it?

16:26.777 --> 16:28.278
Okay, I came and helped.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.571
You said you would pay.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.866
- It's all about the goddamn
money with you, ain't it?

16:32.866 --> 16:34.660
- I mean, unlike you, okay,
I live in the real world.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.495
I have bills and rent I have to pay.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.247
- Ya know, there's more
to life than money.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.873
You gotta believe in somethin'.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.168
- Oh, and that got you so far, right?

16:43.168 --> 16:46.422
You're doin' science
experiments in a barn?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.217
What are you doin', man?

16:50.217 --> 16:52.469
Why don't you go get a real job?

16:52.469 --> 16:53.303
- A real job.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.763
This comin' from a guy who can't hold on

16:54.763 --> 16:56.932
to a job for more than a month.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.143
You gotta believe in something!

16:59.143 --> 17:01.145
You gotta go to a job every day,

17:01.145 --> 17:03.689
day in and day out and show up!

17:05.649 --> 17:06.483
- Show up?

17:08.861 --> 17:09.695
You're the last person
who should be talkin'

17:09.695 --> 17:10.863
about showin' up.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.159
What about my birthday?
Baseball games, huh?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.453
Now, you didn't show up.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.290
Ya know why? 'Cause I
wasn't your priority, Dad.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.584
That was.

17:30.591 --> 17:34.053
That's right. Reality
calls and you run away.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.637
Haven't changed a bit, have you?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.867
Okay, almost got it here.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.786
Hon, why'd
you get this new camera?

17:58.786 --> 17:59.620
- Huh?

17:59.620 --> 18:00.829
Want you to watch this.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.917
Well, I got this new
camera because I wanna get

18:04.917 --> 18:06.627
all his shenanigans on video.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.170
He's growin' up quick.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.546
- You know I don't like
havin' my picture taken.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.466
- It's not a picture, it's video.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.344
Hey, bud, get over-

18:17.387 --> 18:19.556
Why didn't you watch it?

18:19.556 --> 18:22.309
- I'm not the one who needs
to remember her, Kirk.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.062
Since when
have I become Kirk?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.064
- Since I stopped feelin' like your son.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.568
Since you abandoned the family.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.486
- Abandoned the family.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.988
Everything I've done was
for you and your mother.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.365
- You took me away from her.

18:38.075 --> 18:42.746
You separated us until the day she died.

18:42.746 --> 18:43.664
I was nine!

18:46.792 --> 18:48.585
No, no, no, no. No.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
How many days you seen me since then, huh?

18:54.633 --> 18:55.592
How many days, huh?

18:59.054 --> 18:59.930
You left me.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.810
You left me all by myself.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.647
But it was for me and Mom, right?

19:09.606 --> 19:11.984
- I was just tryin' to protect you.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.068
I'm sorry if I-

19:13.068 --> 19:15.696
- Oh, shut up. I don't wanna
hear your sorry sermon.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.784
You can't paint the stripes
off a zebra, and you,

19:20.784 --> 19:23.287
you for damn sure can't
change who you are.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.294
Screw this, I'm outta here.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.673
Go ahead, delete my number.
Don't call me again.

19:35.841 --> 19:36.675
For the record,

19:39.636 --> 19:42.139
when Mom died, God, I wished it was you.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.736
- I wished it was me, too.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.034
Are you leaving now?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.161
- Yeah, I'm done with this shit

20:06.955 --> 20:08.165
- Look, man, why don't you
just leave in the morning?

20:08.165 --> 20:08.999
- No, man, okay.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.584
I gotta get outta here tonight.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.923
- Look, Tom, I get
you're very upset, okay,

20:15.923 --> 20:18.550
and you're very clearly drunk.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.220
I mean your BAC scores are
probably off the charts.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.973
Look, man, that's enough, that's enough.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.728
Just go lie down.

20:29.728 --> 20:34.733
Come on, you don't need
it, man, just here.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.236
Take a load off and you'll
feel better in the morning.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.908
You'll feel better, I promise.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.330
- Thanks, bud. I owe you one.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.164
You're right.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.416
- No problem.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.337
Goodnight.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.762
- Can't sleep, my love?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.597
Come here, little one.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.651
- I am the crown prince.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.069
Welcome to my secret world.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.419
- What are you doin' on
the floor, little buddy?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.878
It hurts.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.046
My hand. Mom, ow!

22:10.287 --> 22:11.121
- Dad.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.266
Drunk again, huh?

22:34.144 --> 22:37.022
Wake up. Hey.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.358
Dad, wake up.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.110
Dad!

22:45.822 --> 22:47.908
Bruno! Bruno!

22:49.701 --> 22:51.036
Hey, come on.

22:51.036 --> 22:51.870
What happened?

22:51.870 --> 22:54.039
- Come on. Come on, buddy, come on.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.374
Where ya at?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.750
- Oh my God, is that?

22:56.750 --> 22:57.834
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Is that Dr. Davis?

22:57.834 --> 22:58.877
- Okay, I don't know what happened, okay?

22:58.877 --> 22:59.711
I just came in.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.297
- Is he?

23:02.297 --> 23:04.883
- He's not breathing.
I can't find a pulse.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.595
- We have to do somethin'.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.516
- I don't know what to do, man.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.561
- Okay, let's go figure somethin' out.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.979
Come on. Come on.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.440
Let's go. It's gonna be okay.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.360
It musta been a heart attack.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.125
Look, Tom, I feel
horrible for saying this,

23:38.125 --> 23:40.877
but we have to think practically.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.506
Okay, if we finish the
testing, we can sell the tech.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.426
- What about my dad?

23:48.677 --> 23:50.887
He was an asshole, but he's human.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.597
Okay, I gotta give him a proper burial.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.433
- If the FBI catch wind
of what we're doing here,

23:54.433 --> 23:57.602
do you know how much jail
time we could be facing?

23:57.602 --> 24:00.021
Okay, Article 4C specifically
sanctions against

24:00.021 --> 24:02.149
all non-chemical memory loss cures,

24:02.149 --> 24:04.943
which is exactly what we're doing here.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.653
- Where are you gonna find a buyer?

24:06.653 --> 24:07.988
- Ya know Reinhard Kindler?

24:09.072 --> 24:09.906
Rocky.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.493
Okay, well, he knows someone who's ready

24:13.493 --> 24:15.412
to buy the finished product.

24:37.642 --> 24:38.852
- I'm sorry, Pops.

25:31.196 --> 25:35.325
Last night you had a massive
heart attack and you died.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.287
I found you in the lab.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.251
You were already gone by
the time I got to you.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.340
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.887
Bruno and I are just gonna
take the research and...

26:00.517 --> 26:03.019
That's whatever, I just...

26:05.647 --> 26:09.693
I'm sorry for the way I treated
you last time I saw you.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.612
I shouldn't have acted like that.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.206
I don't even know if this is gonna work.

26:26.793 --> 26:31.172
This is Tom Davis, June 6th, 7:55 pm.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.968
Surrogate loading Kirk Davis.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.593
Ask Mom and
Dad for what's sure to be

27:16.593 --> 27:18.803
this Christmas's favorite toy.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.598
Rest in

27:21.598 --> 27:22.432
the endless-

27:22.432 --> 27:24.684
of our-

27:25.935 --> 27:26.770
Nucleus-

27:27.604 --> 27:29.189
fat nerds gulp donuts.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.442
I love you.

27:34.527 --> 27:38.448
Kirk, Kathy, you may kiss.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.826
Outstanding
doctoral student goes to

27:41.826 --> 27:44.037
Kirk Davis.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.538
Move the free
radicals and block-

27:45.538 --> 27:46.873
- Dr. Davis.
- Kirk.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.083
- Dr. Davis.
- Kirk!

27:48.083 --> 27:48.958
- Davis.
- Dr. Davis!

27:48.958 --> 27:50.251
Have to take some.

27:50.251 --> 27:53.838
- Dad, wake up.

28:11.106 --> 28:15.694
Last night you had a massive
heart attack and you died.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.072
I found you in the lab.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.452
You were already gone by
the time I got to you.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.583
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.090
Hey, son.

28:38.383 --> 28:43.388
I've gone ahead and let
your news sink in, settle.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.059
Heart attack, huh?

28:50.228 --> 28:51.312
Yeah, your mother always told me

28:51.312 --> 28:53.231
I should lay off the beers and donuts.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.280
Well, it seems like a dream

29:00.280 --> 29:02.240
and I just need to wake up, but...

29:09.164 --> 29:14.169
Listen, Tom, I don't know
about surrogate loadin'.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.173
I can't have you doin' that.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.217
I don't know the side effects,
I mean, they could kill you.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.811
You gotta stop that, too.

29:38.234 --> 29:42.197
I'm not sure what you were talkin' about,

29:45.700 --> 29:48.787
the research, but

29:54.751 --> 29:56.252
I wish we completed it.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.050
I mean, we coulda saved so many families

30:03.468 --> 30:06.596
a lotta heartache, Tom, a lotta heartache.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.894
Ya know, I always wanted another kid.

30:12.894 --> 30:13.937
Mom, though, mm-mm.

30:16.105 --> 30:19.234
You were her full devotion.

30:21.110 --> 30:26.115
I mean, she wanted to give you
every opportunity possible.

30:30.703 --> 30:34.123
She wanted you to be an astronaut,

30:34.123 --> 30:36.459
a doctor, a musician all at the same time.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.048
I miss her, Tom.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.385
I really miss your mom.

30:47.971 --> 30:48.972
And I've missed you.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.396
I miss our family.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.961
Okay, almost got it here.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.504
Tom, why'd
you get this new camera?

31:21.504 --> 31:22.338
- Huh?

31:23.423 --> 31:27.677
Well, I got this new
camera because I wanna get

31:27.677 --> 31:29.554
all his shenanigans on video.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.889
He's growin' up quick.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.016
You know I don't
like havin' my picture taken.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.435
- It's not a picture, it's video.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.897
Hey, bud, get over here.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.107
Happy birthday, hon.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.775
I love you.

32:05.089 --> 32:05.924
One and two and three and four.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.801
- Tom.
- How many years ago

32:08.801 --> 32:09.802
.

32:09.802 --> 32:12.430
Come on, bud,
you're gonna have fun there.

32:14.515 --> 32:17.018
- This machine right here,
it's called a Scammer.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.686
It digitally scans your brain and-

32:18.686 --> 32:19.979
What's up, baby?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.984
This is your brain.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.402
I did you a favor.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.613
- Thank you, Dr. Davis.
- Believe this.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.073
Tom.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.742
- Tom!

32:54.305 --> 32:56.307
- Remind me again why you got it?

32:59.185 --> 33:00.603
Give it a rest, already.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.276
Mommy, you wanna play with me?

33:09.112 --> 33:11.572
Not now, buddy, Mommy's tired.

33:11.572 --> 33:12.740
Maybe later.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.033
- Why is she always tired?

33:14.033 --> 33:15.493
Can you come play with me?

33:15.493 --> 33:16.744
In a bit, okay.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.207
- Poor, baby doll.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.086
What was that boy's name?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.170
Who?

33:26.170 --> 33:28.089
The boy that was just in here.

33:28.965 --> 33:29.882
- Baby doll.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.135
No.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.013
- It's, um, it's...

33:38.891 --> 33:40.977
I don't know, what is it?

33:42.020 --> 33:42.895
It's Tom.

33:46.232 --> 33:47.233
Hey, kiddo.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.404
- Hey, Mom. How are you feeling?

33:51.404 --> 33:53.114
- You're a sweet little thing.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.158
What's your name, sweetie?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.535
- Sometimes you're silly, Mom. It's Tom.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.580
- That's a nice name. Where do you live?

34:01.497 --> 34:02.498
I live here.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.586
- No, we live here. Where do you live?

34:08.254 --> 34:10.089
Where are your parents?

34:15.762 --> 34:16.971
What's goin' on?

34:16.971 --> 34:17.805
It's okay, it's okay.

34:17.805 --> 34:19.015
- Who is he?

34:19.015 --> 34:19.849
Hey.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.976
Why is Mom asking where I live?

34:21.976 --> 34:23.770
Oh, she's just pretendin'.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.607
Ya know how you pretend when you play

34:27.607 --> 34:30.818
like you're a cowboy or a spaceman?

34:30.818 --> 34:32.945
- Yeah.
- That's what she's doin'.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.198
She's just pretendin'. Huh?

34:37.658 --> 34:38.743
Okay.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.954
Why don't you go in your room

34:41.954 --> 34:44.582
and I'll come in in a minute
and we could play, okay?

34:45.917 --> 34:46.918
Huh?
- Okay.

34:55.134 --> 34:57.178
- Hon, are you okay?

34:57.178 --> 34:58.638
Yeah, I'm okay, hon.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.644
Say goodbye to Mommy.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.523
But I don't
wanna leave my friends.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.358
I don't wanna go to a new school.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.192
Oh, come on, bud.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.693
You're gonna have fun there.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.071
- I don't wanna leave
Mom! I don't wanna go!

35:15.071 --> 35:17.657
Hey, if you don't
shut that door right now!

35:18.950 --> 35:20.076
And just stop it.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.955
How many times have we been over this?

35:27.542 --> 35:28.376
Bye, hon!

35:30.086 --> 35:32.672
- Bye. Say hi to your cousin.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.423
- I will.
- She was,

35:34.423 --> 35:35.591
she was too young.
- I'll be back

35:35.591 --> 35:36.425
in time for supper.

35:36.425 --> 35:39.137
- She was too young for that.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.555
Love you.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.324
Why didn't you?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.330
How was that possible?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.877
How did Mom lose her memory?
I mean, she was young.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.049
Why didn't you tell me?

36:19.510 --> 36:23.514
I mean, I hated you, Dad.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.434
I hated you for so long.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.562
Why didn't you tell me? I woulda helped.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.648
I coulda helped. I coulda done something.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.362
I'm not smart enough to
finish this without you.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.572
I don't know what to do.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.045
- Hey, man.

36:54.045 --> 36:54.879
- Hey.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.713
- Guess what?

36:55.713 --> 36:57.715
I just called Rocky and he's
ready to buy everything.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.675
The Mint, the Scammer, all the papers,

37:01.636 --> 37:04.222
I negotiated a pretty good
price, too, so that's good.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.056
- Cool.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.184
Look, man, he can have
the Mint and Scammer,

37:08.184 --> 37:11.896
but I gotta keep the research materials.

37:13.022 --> 37:16.275
- What in the name of science
are you talking about?

37:16.275 --> 37:17.777
I gotta continue my dad's research.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.028
He was trying to cure Alzheimer's.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.071
I mean, if it-
- You're pullin'

37:20.071 --> 37:20.905
my leg, right?

37:20.905 --> 37:21.948
Come on, just help me pack.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.075
Why don't you grab that.
- No, I'm serious, okay.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.493
I gotta finish my dad's work.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.039
- You realize that in
just a few short hours

37:30.039 --> 37:33.376
we can have more money than
Shelby Cobras have horsepower?

37:33.376 --> 37:35.920
But you're just being unreasonable.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.088
- Okay, fine.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.090
Gimme a few hours. I'll make
copies of the schematics.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.341
It'll be fine.
- No, we can't make

37:40.341 --> 37:41.384
a copy, okay?

37:41.384 --> 37:44.136
The price includes exclusivity, all right?

37:44.136 --> 37:45.012
Do you know what that means?

37:45.012 --> 37:45.846
- Yes I do.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.182
- No, apparently you don't, okay?

37:48.182 --> 37:49.558
Do you know why somebody buys

37:49.558 --> 37:51.894
a Bugatti Veyron Pur Sang for $3 million?

37:53.062 --> 37:54.897
There's only five of
them in the entire world.

37:54.897 --> 37:57.608
That means only five people own them.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.903
It's exclusive. Exclusivity.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.322
Look, will you stop?

38:03.322 --> 38:04.782
Okay, give it a rest.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.618
- Dude, you seriously cannot
be doing this right now.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.162
- Look, if I can't make any
copies, I'm not selling it.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.665
- This is dead end research
with no practical use.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.500
- My mom had Alzheimer's, okay?

38:17.878 --> 38:18.713
- Excuse me.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.591
- That's why my dad started all this, man.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.135
That's why I have to finish it.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.388
Okay, look, I'm sorry, Bruno.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.224
Hey, but if I can't make
copies, I can't sell it.

38:35.938 --> 38:39.817
- Okay, but how are you
gonna finish the research?

38:41.777 --> 38:42.778
- I don't know, I have his notes.

38:42.778 --> 38:45.489
I can use those. I thought
maybe you could help.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.866
- Yeah, what if I don't wanna help?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.785
- Then it's just me and the notes.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.415
Come on.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.501
- All right, fine, I'll help
you, but we do this my way.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.086
- That's fine. That's fine.

38:59.962 --> 39:00.796
Just,

39:02.256 --> 39:04.759
I need your help with something, okay?

39:04.759 --> 39:05.968
Just come on.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.841
Everything okay?

39:45.841 --> 39:48.386
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, just my mom.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.556
She wants to see if I
went to temple or not.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.351
- Didn't know you were religious.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.854
- Here and there. Beer?

40:00.022 --> 40:01.357
- Didn't know you drank either.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.109
- Here and there.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.995
- Hey man, let's have a little fun.

40:14.995 --> 40:15.996
- What kind of fun?

40:18.332 --> 40:19.500
- Look you can trust me, all right.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.709
I'm a research assistant.

40:20.709 --> 40:21.919
- Man, that just sounds
like a redneck saying,

40:21.919 --> 40:24.255
"Here, hold my beer and watch this."

40:24.255 --> 40:26.507
Look, I don't wanna fry my brain.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.383
- You won't!

40:28.259 --> 40:29.093
All right, how 'bout this?

40:29.093 --> 40:31.095
- Okay, if it makes you feel better,

40:31.095 --> 40:33.097
I can load your backup first.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.849
Man, I don't...

40:34.849 --> 40:35.891
- Dude, come on.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.518
If something goes wrong, it'll be my brain

40:37.518 --> 40:38.352
that gets fried, right?

40:38.352 --> 40:39.979
You've got nothing to lose.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.606
And if it works, then we
can load mine onto yours.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.154
Dude, I said no to a buttload of money

40:48.154 --> 40:49.613
just to help you out.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.158
Okay, and besides, you owe me.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.325
Remember that night you got super drunk

40:53.325 --> 40:54.910
and I stopped you from leaving?

40:54.910 --> 40:56.370
Do you remember what you said?

40:56.370 --> 40:57.872
- I owe you.
- Yeah.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.457
- All right, fine.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.006
You sure this is gonna work?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.841
- Yeah, man. I've done
it before, all right?

41:08.841 --> 41:10.217
It's just like drivin' a-

41:10.217 --> 41:12.553
- No car analogies, okay. I don't get 'em.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.637
Whose backup did you load?

41:13.637 --> 41:15.014
- Ya know, nobody important.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.599
- Ya know if you keep doin' that,

41:16.599 --> 41:18.267
you're gonna get down to your knuckles?

41:18.267 --> 41:21.854
All right,
drivers, start your engines.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.689
- What did I just say?

41:23.689 --> 41:25.774
- I'm from the Motor City, man. I'm sorry.

41:27.776 --> 41:28.652
Okay, here we go.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.290
This is Dr. Kirk Davis.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.542
Sorry I missed your call.

41:43.542 --> 41:46.337
Leave a name and number
and I will call you back.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.260
Bruno, calm down, man.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.012
- Why do you keep calling me Bruno?

41:56.180 --> 41:57.014
I'm Tom.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.058
- No.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.024
What's my social?

42:07.024 --> 42:07.858
- What?

42:07.858 --> 42:09.026
- What's my social?

42:09.026 --> 42:11.487
- 645-52-6465.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.822
- That's crazy. What's our
deepest, darkest secret?

42:13.822 --> 42:15.366
- Backin' up over Joshua's
cat and then telling him

42:15.366 --> 42:17.493
it ran away when he couldn't find it.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.953
- Tat on my left chest.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.788
- Okay, stop, stop, that's enough.

42:20.788 --> 42:21.664
- Look, I'm sorry, bro.

42:21.664 --> 42:25.626
What do I call you? This is crazy.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.797
- Dear Chu, love you lots.

42:31.006 --> 42:32.841
The tat on your left chest.

42:32.841 --> 42:34.218
Dear Chu, love you lots.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.433
- Man, cheers to takin'
care of our own selves.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.226
- Cheers.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.945
- All right, let's go
inside. There's more beer.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.874
This is Dr. Kirk Davis.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.710
Sorry I missed your call.

43:07.710 --> 43:10.212
Leave a name and number
and I will call you back.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.477
- Are you okay?

43:29.273 --> 43:30.524
No, hey. Bruno.

43:36.780 --> 43:37.615
Tom?

43:38.532 --> 43:40.868
What the hell are you doing?

43:42.786 --> 43:43.621
Yo. Whoa.

43:50.127 --> 43:55.132
What are you doing?

44:04.475 --> 44:06.393
- Hey, Bruno, what are you doing?

44:06.393 --> 44:08.562
Bruno, stop! Stop!

44:08.562 --> 44:09.396
Stop!

44:17.321 --> 44:18.155
What is going on?

44:18.155 --> 44:19.740
Are you okay?

44:19.740 --> 44:21.533
Tom, are you okay?

44:22.701 --> 44:24.453
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:24.453 --> 44:25.412
- What is going on?

44:25.412 --> 44:26.580
Why was Bruno tryin' to choke you?

44:26.580 --> 44:28.415
- It's not Bruno, it's me.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.334
- What?

44:30.334 --> 44:33.545
- I circuit loaded my memory onto Bruno.

44:33.545 --> 44:35.297
- Okay, I don't know what that means.

44:35.297 --> 44:37.341
- I put my memory on Bruno.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.093
Ya know that's stupid,

44:39.093 --> 44:41.261
even for a stupid person.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.262
Where is your dad?

44:42.262 --> 44:44.348
Does he know what you guys are up to?

44:44.348 --> 44:45.474
- He isn't here.

44:45.474 --> 44:47.017
Well, where is he?

44:47.017 --> 44:50.312
- He's at a hospital.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.106
He's outta town.

44:52.981 --> 44:53.982
He's doin' research.

44:55.442 --> 44:57.736
- That's odd, 'cause he
didn't say anything to me.

44:57.736 --> 44:59.446
- Let's just get him inside, okay.

45:01.490 --> 45:02.658
- Okay, ready?

45:02.658 --> 45:04.034
- One, two.
- Come on.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.661
- Okay.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.453
- I gotcha, come on.

45:06.453 --> 45:07.538
- All right, this way, this way.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.372
- Let's go, buddy.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.374
Come on.
- Okay.

45:10.374 --> 45:11.625
Okay.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.597
Hey.
- Good mornin'.

45:28.225 --> 45:30.769
Mm, that's how your dad checks my math.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.315
Yeah, he's awesome.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.568
Who's awesome?

45:40.696 --> 45:41.530
- Not you.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.117
- So, what happened last night?

45:46.952 --> 45:47.953
- Oh, shoot.

45:49.329 --> 45:52.791
Your buddy here will
give you the low down.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.961
I have to vamoose to class.

45:55.961 --> 45:59.256
But in the meantime, don't you guys

45:59.256 --> 46:01.300
go messin' with things
that you don't understand.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.134
You hear me?

46:02.134 --> 46:02.968
- Yes, ma'am.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.052
- Yes, ma'am.

46:05.137 --> 46:06.805
There's still hope for
you yet, tenderfoot.

46:09.641 --> 46:13.103
- So, what happened
last night? Did it work?

46:13.103 --> 46:14.229
- For an hour.

46:15.230 --> 46:17.191
- Okay, and then what?

46:17.191 --> 46:19.401
- The load went well,
but then you went crazy.

46:19.401 --> 46:21.737
I mean, you tried to attack me.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.864
- You mean you attacked yourself?

46:23.864 --> 46:25.449
- You threw things at me.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.993
You chased me around, you
put me in a choke hold.

46:27.993 --> 46:29.244
I mean, thank God Chloe showed up

46:29.244 --> 46:31.914
when she did and laid
you out with a shovel.

46:31.914 --> 46:34.374
- Okay, well, that explains this.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.293
God, she's got a mean swing.

46:36.293 --> 46:37.503
- Look, I'm not doin' that again, man.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.922
Okay, that scared the hell outta me.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.799
- Don't be such a downer, buddy, okay?

46:41.799 --> 46:44.384
Look at the shiny side. It worked.

46:45.928 --> 46:50.933
So, are you still against
selling this research?

46:51.016 --> 46:53.435
- She hit you a lot harder
than I expected, man.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.565
Do you not remember what
we discussed last night?

47:00.025 --> 47:01.693
I'm not selling. It's still a no.

47:07.324 --> 47:08.659
- It's fine.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.118
Just thought I'd ask again, ya know,

47:10.118 --> 47:11.370
just see what ya thought.

47:12.454 --> 47:13.956
Ya know what, this still kinda aches,

47:13.956 --> 47:17.334
so I think I'm gonna go get
it checked out at a doctors.

47:17.334 --> 47:18.585
- You want me to take you to the hospital?

47:18.585 --> 47:20.963
- No, no, no, no, no. It's fine.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.257
Just let me know where you'll be later.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.675
- The lab. Why?

47:24.675 --> 47:25.884
- Just wondering.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.388
- All right.

47:34.476 --> 47:35.561
How was that possible?

47:36.603 --> 47:39.439
How did Mom lose her memory?
I mean, she was young.

47:44.361 --> 47:46.154
Why didn't you tell me?

47:46.154 --> 47:48.615
I coulda helped. I coulda done something.

47:48.615 --> 47:50.576
I'm not smart enough to
finish this without you.

47:50.576 --> 47:51.785
I don't know what to do.

47:59.459 --> 48:01.503
Look, Dad, don't freak out, okay.

48:01.503 --> 48:03.338
Watch the video logs from yesterday,

48:03.338 --> 48:07.134
but I need your help to
complete the research, okay?

48:07.134 --> 48:08.635
I have no idea what I'm doing.

48:09.595 --> 48:13.098
I don't have any side effects
from yesterday, I feel fine.

48:13.098 --> 48:15.392
Plus I've loaded you once before.

48:15.392 --> 48:16.310
I think it's safe.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.689
What do ya say? Let's work together?

48:23.734 --> 48:28.739
I guess what I'm tryin' to
say is I'm not goin' anywhere.

48:28.780 --> 48:31.867
Okay, I'm staying here and
I'm gonna fulfill your legacy.

48:34.077 --> 48:37.956
Look, I just need you to do me a favor.

48:37.956 --> 48:41.084
Can we speed things up?

48:42.044 --> 48:43.629
It's really unsettling thinking about you

48:43.629 --> 48:44.963
using the bathroom as me.

48:46.798 --> 48:51.595
Anyways, this is Tom Davis,
June 7th, 8:15 am, 22 seconds.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.932
Surrogate loading Kirk Davis.

48:59.311 --> 49:00.145
Mornin', son.

49:01.229 --> 49:04.107
I can see you're dead set on doin' this

49:04.107 --> 49:07.402
come hell or high water, so
might as well join the party.

49:09.321 --> 49:10.322
About your mother,

49:12.991 --> 49:14.284
yeah, she was young,

49:15.118 --> 49:19.998
too young for Alzheimer's,
but it's not impossible.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.502
There are certain genes.

49:23.502 --> 49:26.129
You got your APP, your PSEN1, PSEN2.

49:27.839 --> 49:30.092
Certain mutations can cause, well,

49:33.595 --> 49:36.556
an onset of symptoms early on.

49:40.727 --> 49:41.561
Tom, you,

49:46.650 --> 49:49.945
you got a 50/50 shot of havin'
the same genes as your mom.

49:53.198 --> 49:57.119
You been forgettin' where
you're puttin' your car keys?

49:59.037 --> 50:01.748
That's not meant to be a joke.

50:03.166 --> 50:05.335
Just watch for them patterns,

50:05.335 --> 50:07.671
and you let me know if
you see anything, okay?

50:34.031 --> 50:34.865
Hey, son.

50:36.283 --> 50:37.784
Memories with high emotion,

50:38.702 --> 50:40.495
they're retained for a longer time.

50:41.413 --> 50:44.291
Now, we can focus on this and
improve the CRUM percentage

50:44.291 --> 50:45.709
if we focus on the amygdala-

50:46.543 --> 50:47.377
cerebral cortex.

50:49.296 --> 50:53.508
Besides that, you can
continue to surrogate load.

50:53.508 --> 50:55.010
Okay, but under one condition.

50:57.137 --> 51:01.808
If you start experiencing
any side effects, you stop.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.061
Okay, immediately.

51:07.606 --> 51:09.483
I can't lose you, too, son.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.778
And I'll see you on the flip side.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.410
Yeah, hold on, Bruno.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.294
Hold up, Bruno.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.342
- I have a warrant for your arrest.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.969
- I'm sorry, a warrant for what?

51:37.969 --> 51:41.014
- For murdering your dad
and tampering with evidence.

51:42.724 --> 51:44.017
- I think there's been a confusion.

51:44.017 --> 51:45.769
My dad's still alive.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.270
- I know where you buried him.

51:48.814 --> 51:51.024
How could you know?

51:54.611 --> 51:57.364
All right, yeah, he died,
but it was of natural causes.

51:57.364 --> 51:59.157
You can't arrest me for that.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.784
- Tell it to the judge, kid.

52:03.703 --> 52:06.164
Why are you makin' this difficult?

52:06.164 --> 52:08.125
- Look, you don't have any evidence.

52:08.125 --> 52:08.959
Watch.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.111
- What the hell are you doin'?

52:36.111 --> 52:38.363
What are you doin' in here?

52:39.948 --> 52:41.491
- Doin' a video log.

52:41.491 --> 52:42.492
- Video log?

52:46.454 --> 52:47.706
Son of a bitch.

53:09.853 --> 53:11.605
- Is that enough proof for ya, son?

53:12.981 --> 53:14.399
Ow!

53:14.399 --> 53:16.401
Goddamn it! My bad foot.

53:19.529 --> 53:21.865
Once the FBI catches wind
of your rogue research,

53:21.865 --> 53:24.117
they will take everything,
no questions asked.

53:24.117 --> 53:25.827
You and your dad's work are done.

53:25.827 --> 53:27.162
- Look, I didn't kill him.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.293
Now make this easy, Tom.

53:33.293 --> 53:35.378
You are gonna go down one way or another.

53:39.674 --> 53:41.635
- Okay, fine, I'll come out.

53:53.563 --> 53:54.648
- Goddamn it.

54:42.612 --> 54:44.364
He got away.

54:44.364 --> 54:46.741
Does not matter as
long as you got what we wanted.

54:46.741 --> 54:47.575
- I got it.

54:55.542 --> 54:58.712
- Where's the headset?
Where's everything else?

54:58.712 --> 55:00.297
Hmm?

55:00.297 --> 55:03.174
- All right, take this idiot
and go get the rest of it.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.718
Don't look so confused.

55:04.718 --> 55:08.930
It applies equally to
both of you.

55:18.231 --> 55:19.733
Oh crap. Not now.

55:21.401 --> 55:23.903
Okay, just relax.

55:23.903 --> 55:25.238
Bruno, let's go.

55:28.283 --> 55:30.410
I know exactly what's
going on in your head.

55:30.410 --> 55:31.911
Just stay there.

55:32.746 --> 55:33.955
Just stay there.

55:36.082 --> 55:37.584
You hold him!

55:37.584 --> 55:38.835
- What's goin' on with him?
- Hold him for me.

55:38.835 --> 55:39.919
Bruno.
- What?

55:52.432 --> 55:54.559
What happened to him?

55:54.559 --> 55:55.518
- TICS.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.354
- You mean like Lyme disease?

55:57.354 --> 56:01.149
- T-I-C-S, time-induced
conflict by surrogacy.

56:01.149 --> 56:03.109
Simply put, this is when a surrogate

56:03.109 --> 56:05.153
wants to get its body back.

56:05.153 --> 56:05.987
Why?

56:05.987 --> 56:09.199
- Surrogate loading separates
the brain from the body,

56:09.199 --> 56:10.158
disrupting the system.

56:10.158 --> 56:11.868
The surrogate will do whatever it can

56:11.868 --> 56:13.870
to get back to its home.

56:13.870 --> 56:17.040
Like a homing pigeon
finding its way back, hmm?

56:17.040 --> 56:18.166
Give me his watch.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.336
Somebody's coming. Let's go.

56:45.777 --> 56:48.530
- I swear, I didn't do any of it.

56:49.614 --> 56:52.242
I swear, I didn't do
anything in that video.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.332
I don't remember any of it, Dad.

56:59.332 --> 57:02.168
I drank that night, I did,
but I didn't black out.

57:11.553 --> 57:14.013
I don't know what's happening.

57:14.013 --> 57:17.016
I don't know if I have what Mom has.

57:20.061 --> 57:20.895
I need your help.

57:26.151 --> 57:28.486
I need your help really bad.

57:59.559 --> 58:00.435
Hey, Dad.

58:06.566 --> 58:08.234
Look, I don't have the best news.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.822
The cops, they caught wind of the research

58:12.822 --> 58:16.117
and we had to shut down.

58:18.286 --> 58:19.329
I don't think that I,

58:22.457 --> 58:24.375
I don't think we can
continue the research.

58:24.375 --> 58:25.585
I gotta stop.

58:26.461 --> 58:27.712
I mean, I have nowhere else to turn

58:27.712 --> 58:29.464
and I don't know what to do, and...

58:35.053 --> 58:39.224
I'm sorry.

58:39.224 --> 58:41.851
I'm sorry I let you down
when you needed me the most.

58:45.855 --> 58:46.898
I love you, Dad.

59:06.501 --> 59:08.002
Hey,
Monty, do you wanna go on

59:08.002 --> 59:09.462
out to the Hook Ranch?

59:09.462 --> 59:13.508
The old man's complainin'
about those coyotes again.

59:13.508 --> 59:14.342
Monty?

59:15.718 --> 59:17.136
Monty, you there?

59:18.555 --> 59:19.472
- Yeah, I'm here.

59:19.472 --> 59:22.308
Hey,
what's goin' on with you?

59:22.308 --> 59:25.103
- Two guys flagged me
down and next thing I know

59:25.103 --> 59:26.646
you're askin' me what happened.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.734
I need to get checked.

59:31.734 --> 59:32.569
Well, you ain't

59:32.569 --> 59:34.153
a spring chicken anymore, Monty.

59:35.071 --> 59:38.074
Swing by the ranch and then go
get checked out, you hear me?

59:39.701 --> 59:40.618
- Yes, ma'am.

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:11.190
- Look, I don't have the best news.

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:15.570
The cops, they caught wind
of the research and...

1:00:16.821 --> 1:00:17.655
Damn it.

1:00:17.655 --> 1:00:19.282
We had to shut down.

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:20.533
Hand it to 'em.

1:00:20.533 --> 1:00:21.659
I don't think that I...

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:25.163
It's okay, son, it's okay.

1:00:31.127 --> 1:00:32.879
Hand it to 'em, okay.

1:00:39.177 --> 1:00:44.182
- Well, well, look what
the Chupacabra dragged in.

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:45.975
- Hey, hon.

1:00:45.975 --> 1:00:47.435
I just haven't seen you in a while

1:00:47.435 --> 1:00:48.311
and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:53.274
- Oh, easy there, cowboy.
I saw you this morning.

1:00:57.570 --> 1:01:00.531
- That's right, we did, 'cause I'm Tom.

1:01:00.531 --> 1:01:02.825
I don't know what I'm sayin' anymore.

1:01:04.577 --> 1:01:06.496
- That research gettin' to your brain?

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:11.334
That was supposed to be funny.

1:01:11.334 --> 1:01:12.710
Whatever. What do you want?

1:01:13.961 --> 1:01:15.463
- The usual will be fine.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:18.675
Thirsty goat.

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:21.302
- Just like your daddy.

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:27.934
- Ya know, actually, lemme go
ahead and get three of those

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:30.395
and three of those famous
Chloe blue whale shots.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:34.273
- Okay, hope you got company coming.

1:01:37.235 --> 1:01:38.069
- Just for me.

1:01:58.047 --> 1:01:58.881
- Hello?

1:02:01.384 --> 1:02:02.176
Hurry up.

1:02:03.386 --> 1:02:06.055
What's goin' on?

1:02:06.055 --> 1:02:08.683
- Is he back? Where is he?

1:02:08.683 --> 1:02:09.642
Kirk!

1:02:09.642 --> 1:02:11.018
- Oh my God.
- Kirk!

1:02:13.479 --> 1:02:15.648
You need to explain to me
what the hell is going on.

1:02:21.446 --> 1:02:22.947
- You're so stupid.

1:02:22.947 --> 1:02:24.907
Why am I stupid?

1:02:24.907 --> 1:02:26.159
- You have a hangover.

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:28.745
You had eight beers and
four shots in 20 minutes.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:31.164
You were commode-hugging,
knee-walking drunk.

1:02:31.164 --> 1:02:32.206
What did you expect?

1:02:33.458 --> 1:02:35.585
- I haven't even been to your bar.

1:02:35.585 --> 1:02:37.211
- What?

1:02:37.211 --> 1:02:39.839
You're telling me that you
don't remember coming to my bar

1:02:39.839 --> 1:02:42.091
and ordering the same exact
drink that your dad orders.

1:02:42.091 --> 1:02:43.509
That's what you're telling me.

1:02:44.844 --> 1:02:46.888
- I didn't go to your bar.

1:02:49.098 --> 1:02:51.851
And even if I did, okay,
and I ordered the same beer,

1:02:53.019 --> 1:02:53.895
just calm down, okay?

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:56.314
It's just a coincidence.
- Stop talking.

1:02:56.314 --> 1:02:58.983
You're digging yourself a
Texas-size hole, you know that?

1:02:58.983 --> 1:03:01.736
Ya know you used his
credit card to pay, right?

1:03:01.736 --> 1:03:02.570
Oh.

1:03:04.489 --> 1:03:05.698
Can't forget about this.

1:03:08.868 --> 1:03:09.702
Hmm?

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:16.417
He's been gone for several
days and you tell me

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:18.085
that all of a sudden, he goes outta town,

1:03:18.085 --> 1:03:20.922
which he hasn't done in
the past 10 years ever.

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:23.049
And then you show up to my bar,

1:03:23.049 --> 1:03:26.469
calling me hon and dragging
up my ex-boyfriend,

1:03:26.469 --> 1:03:28.596
ordering the same beer
that your dad orders,

1:03:28.596 --> 1:03:29.597
and then this?

1:03:30.681 --> 1:03:33.434
Something's off and you need
to tell me what it is now.

1:03:36.562 --> 1:03:37.563
Where is he?

1:03:39.065 --> 1:03:40.608
Where is he?

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:41.943
- He's dead.

1:03:41.943 --> 1:03:43.402
- What?

1:03:45.404 --> 1:03:48.115
- I think I killed him.

1:03:48.115 --> 1:03:50.201
You think what?

1:03:52.703 --> 1:03:53.955
- I killed him.

1:03:56.415 --> 1:03:57.500
I killed my dad.

1:04:00.795 --> 1:04:02.380
This better be the beer talking.

1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:07.343
- The other night I went to the lab.

1:04:11.138 --> 1:04:12.473
He was on the ground.

1:04:12.473 --> 1:04:13.599
He was...

1:04:13.599 --> 1:04:14.433
- He was what?

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:17.019
Wake up!

1:04:18.479 --> 1:04:20.064
Why are you saying that
you killed your dad?

1:04:20.064 --> 1:04:21.274
Why are you saying that?

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:24.235
You have two minutes to explain yourself

1:04:24.235 --> 1:04:25.444
or I'm calling the cops.

1:04:25.444 --> 1:04:26.279
Go.

1:04:29.407 --> 1:04:32.785
- I walked into the lab, okay,
and he was on the ground.

1:04:37.957 --> 1:04:40.251
- All right, that's it. I'm done.

1:04:40.251 --> 1:04:41.085
- No!

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:44.130
- Then tell me!

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:49.468
- Just show it to you, okay?

1:04:49.468 --> 1:04:51.512
Show it to you, come on.

1:04:51.512 --> 1:04:52.346
- Touch me.

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:18.748
You did this?

1:05:21.584 --> 1:05:24.795
How could you say you
don't remember doing this?

1:05:24.795 --> 1:05:26.047
- They showed me a video.

1:05:28.132 --> 1:05:33.137
I saw myself, okay, but
I don't remember, Chloe.

1:05:33.262 --> 1:05:35.181
I swear to God, I don't remember it.

1:05:35.181 --> 1:05:36.015
- How can someone forget something

1:05:36.015 --> 1:05:37.850
as important as killing someone?

1:05:40.436 --> 1:05:41.687
- I don't know.

1:05:44.190 --> 1:05:46.233
I might, I might have...

1:05:49.654 --> 1:05:50.655
- What your mom had?

1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:56.494
Oh God.

1:06:04.085 --> 1:06:05.586
This is too much.

1:06:10.299 --> 1:06:14.053
Your dad spent his entire life
trying to cure Alzheimer's

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:19.016
and now you have the
same disease.

1:06:22.186 --> 1:06:23.020
- I don't know whether to go

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:24.438
to the authorities or the hospital.

1:06:24.438 --> 1:06:27.441
Like, I don't know if I'm a
criminal or a patient, Chloe.

1:06:30.528 --> 1:06:31.362
What if I'm both?

1:06:33.781 --> 1:06:35.700
- Stop, stop.

1:06:37.284 --> 1:06:42.289
Look, even if you have Alzheimer's

1:06:47.378 --> 1:06:48.629
or even if you killed your dad,

1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.674
what could you do if you're in jail?

1:06:53.801 --> 1:06:58.431
The Tom I know is a good guy,
and he has a job to finish.

1:07:01.183 --> 1:07:02.435
And I'm here to help you.

1:07:03.894 --> 1:07:05.438
- I just don't know how, Chloe.

1:07:06.647 --> 1:07:09.442
I mean, our cover's blown,
the lab's inaccessible,

1:07:09.442 --> 1:07:11.485
the cops are on our tail right now.

1:07:11.485 --> 1:07:12.737
I just, I don't know how.

1:07:14.905 --> 1:07:15.990
- I may have a place.

1:07:17.241 --> 1:07:19.201
I mean, it's a dump, but it's secluded.

1:07:22.371 --> 1:07:25.332
- I think I should just turn
myself into the authorities.

1:07:25.332 --> 1:07:27.084
- No, don't, come on.

1:07:28.252 --> 1:07:29.086
Come with me.

1:07:31.005 --> 1:07:33.799
You can turn yourself in after you finish

1:07:33.799 --> 1:07:38.804
your dad's research, but until
then strap on your boots.

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:42.558
We have strays to round up. Now.

1:08:08.959 --> 1:08:10.961
Like I said, I mean, it's
not much of a place, but.

1:08:10.961 --> 1:08:12.171
- What's the story?

1:08:14.381 --> 1:08:16.008
- It's my Uncle Mario's.

1:08:16.008 --> 1:08:17.718
Isn't he in jail? Oh.

1:08:28.813 --> 1:08:31.440
- Yeah, this is what I meant
by round up the strays.

1:08:34.193 --> 1:08:38.155
- Chloe, this is awesome, but
I gotta get my own equipment.

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:44.411
- Wait. Wait!

1:08:45.830 --> 1:08:47.665
You can't go back to your
house or the lab, okay?

1:08:47.665 --> 1:08:48.791
It's a hot scene.

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:50.000
You'll easily get arrested.

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.752
- Look, I have to get the files.

1:08:51.752 --> 1:08:52.920
I have to get my dad's laptop, okay.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:54.630
I have to rerecord the logs for him.

1:08:54.630 --> 1:08:56.090
Every time I upload 'em it's like starting

1:08:56.090 --> 1:08:57.633
at day one over and over again.

1:08:59.051 --> 1:09:00.594
- All right, you stay, I'll go.

1:09:02.054 --> 1:09:03.806
- You don't have access to the lab.

1:09:05.266 --> 1:09:07.434
- Well, you still need
a lookout. I'm coming.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:10.104
Can you be quick?

1:09:11.647 --> 1:09:12.481
- Yeah.

1:09:25.035 --> 1:09:25.870
- Wait.

1:09:27.788 --> 1:09:28.914
Go, go.

1:10:10.748 --> 1:10:11.624
Hey.

1:10:23.427 --> 1:10:24.970
Hey.

1:10:47.076 --> 1:10:48.160
- Look at me.

1:11:07.263 --> 1:11:10.349
I don't know what's goin' on anymore.

1:11:14.645 --> 1:11:19.650
I saw a video of me strangling
you, but I don't know,

1:11:19.942 --> 1:11:20.943
I don't know when it happened,

1:11:20.943 --> 1:11:22.319
I don't know how it happened.

1:11:22.319 --> 1:11:25.030
I can't remember a thing,
but I think I killed you and

1:11:28.033 --> 1:11:29.743
I think I might have what Mom had.

1:11:30.828 --> 1:11:35.082
I just, I don't trust myself anymore.

1:11:35.082 --> 1:11:35.916
Okay, you might.

1:11:43.507 --> 1:11:44.341
Come on.

1:11:50.347 --> 1:11:51.181
Hey, Dad.

1:11:52.474 --> 1:11:56.437
Look, last time you talked about amygdala.

1:11:58.647 --> 1:11:59.481
I don't know, I think you're right.

1:11:59.481 --> 1:12:01.150
There's a lotta potential.

1:12:01.150 --> 1:12:02.776
Just, what are CRUMS?

1:12:02.776 --> 1:12:04.028
How do I test for 'em?

1:12:04.028 --> 1:12:06.530
I mean, just let me know what to do.

1:12:07.906 --> 1:12:09.783
I'll see ya on the flip side.

1:12:09.783 --> 1:12:13.537
This is Tom Davis surrogate
loading Kirk Davis.

1:12:45.861 --> 1:12:47.404
- Tom, are you okay?

1:12:49.031 --> 1:12:50.407
Oh, Mr. Kirk?

1:12:52.576 --> 1:12:54.787
- Now you're catchin' on fast.

1:12:54.787 --> 1:12:56.080
Oh, that's nasty.

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:57.915
Look, I just wanna thank
you for takin' care of Tom.

1:12:57.915 --> 1:12:59.416
Been a big help.

1:12:59.416 --> 1:13:00.376
- Yeah.

1:13:02.086 --> 1:13:03.754
Hey, you wanna see somethin' funny?

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:08.801
He shouldn't be dippin'.

1:13:15.641 --> 1:13:18.644
Look, before we start studying
for that test of yours,

1:13:18.644 --> 1:13:20.396
I gotta ask you somethin'.

1:13:21.730 --> 1:13:24.024
You seen any changes
in Tom's mood recently?

1:13:26.068 --> 1:13:26.902
- Like?

1:13:29.279 --> 1:13:32.866
- Could be rage, anxiety, restlessness,

1:13:38.705 --> 1:13:39.540
Chloe?

1:13:42.918 --> 1:13:44.837
- No, no, none of that.

1:13:46.630 --> 1:13:47.965
- Okay, good.

1:13:49.383 --> 1:13:51.760
All right, well you know
how all this works, right?

1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:54.304
The Scammer, the Mint,
how Tom loads my memory

1:13:54.304 --> 1:13:55.722
onto himself and I wake up?

1:13:57.850 --> 1:13:59.268
- Kind of, yeah.

1:14:00.727 --> 1:14:02.688
- All right, well, it takes some time

1:14:02.688 --> 1:14:05.232
before my memory transfers to him.

1:14:05.232 --> 1:14:07.359
We'll call these load times.

1:14:07.359 --> 1:14:10.571
Now, I've been monitoring
the past few days

1:14:10.571 --> 1:14:12.364
and they've shortened significantly.

1:14:13.282 --> 1:14:16.160
- But faster is better, right?

1:14:17.035 --> 1:14:18.287
- Well, not in this case.

1:14:20.539 --> 1:14:21.832
It's inversely proportional

1:14:21.832 --> 1:14:23.584
to the delta neural mapping of the brain.

1:14:23.584 --> 1:14:26.962
Now, the smaller
difference between the host

1:14:26.962 --> 1:14:30.507
and the loaded memory, quicker the upload.

1:14:32.926 --> 1:14:34.136
- Okay, you know that I have trouble

1:14:34.136 --> 1:14:35.512
with simple algebra, right?

1:14:36.430 --> 1:14:38.974
Can you just tell me
whether that's good or bad?

1:14:38.974 --> 1:14:40.309
- I don't think it's good.

1:14:44.062 --> 1:14:47.024
- And you said that rage was
a side effect of all this?

1:14:47.024 --> 1:14:48.525
- Yeah, it could be.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.530
Why, is Tom showing rage?

1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:56.200
- I told you no.

1:14:59.703 --> 1:15:00.537
- Okay.

1:15:01.955 --> 1:15:05.167
Well look, why don't you
look over the polynomials.

1:15:05.167 --> 1:15:08.337
We'll study in a little
bit together, okay?

1:15:08.337 --> 1:15:09.171
- Okay.

1:15:39.952 --> 1:15:43.455
.

1:15:55.634 --> 1:15:56.468
- Tom!

1:15:58.011 --> 1:15:58.971
What are you doing?

1:16:03.267 --> 1:16:04.309
- I thought you were,

1:16:07.479 --> 1:16:08.689
I thought you were...

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:15.195
- Ya know what, forget it. Come with me.

1:16:15.195 --> 1:16:16.405
So your dad said that you need

1:16:16.405 --> 1:16:19.283
to rerecord your brain on the scanner?

1:16:19.283 --> 1:16:20.534
- No, it's a Scammer.

1:16:20.534 --> 1:16:21.368
- Okay, whatever.

1:16:21.368 --> 1:16:23.662
I can't keep track of all these acronyms,

1:16:23.662 --> 1:16:25.956
a Scammer, Mint, CRUMS.

1:16:25.956 --> 1:16:27.165
I mean, how many acronyms
can one person come up with?

1:16:27.165 --> 1:16:28.709
Amen.

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:29.585
- Glad you agree.

1:16:30.419 --> 1:16:34.047
- Hey, acronyms make
everything nifty.

1:16:36.008 --> 1:16:36.842
Why am I stupid?

1:16:39.303 --> 1:16:41.930
I hope Chloe told you what's goin' on.

1:16:41.930 --> 1:16:44.808
I need you to make a backup
copy of your memory tonight,

1:16:44.808 --> 1:16:46.018
okay, and leave me the old noggin

1:16:46.018 --> 1:16:47.978
and the new noggin to compare tomorrow.

1:16:48.895 --> 1:16:49.938
It's important, Tom.

1:16:51.273 --> 1:16:52.899
I saw today's updates, I mean,

1:16:54.776 --> 1:16:57.571
your bug fix on the self-referencing loop.

1:16:57.571 --> 1:17:01.158
I mean, you got the whole
time up to 12 hours now.

1:17:04.661 --> 1:17:07.331
You're findin' things that
never even occurred to me.

1:17:11.293 --> 1:17:15.839
I'm proud of you, son.
I'm so proud of you.

1:17:18.425 --> 1:17:19.676
About your question on CRUMs,

1:17:19.676 --> 1:17:24.306
it stands for causal residual
from unloaded memory.

1:17:24.306 --> 1:17:29.102
Okay, now that's memory retained
after the Mint turns off.

1:17:29.102 --> 1:17:30.896
It's like muscle memory.

1:17:31.813 --> 1:17:35.901
Now, the more you upload
the more permanent

1:17:35.901 --> 1:17:36.943
that memory becomes.

1:17:39.404 --> 1:17:42.032
Are you okay, Mr. Kirk?

1:17:42.032 --> 1:17:43.742
- Everything's fine, hon.

1:17:43.742 --> 1:17:46.578
Why don't you pack your stuff up?

1:17:46.578 --> 1:17:47.746
I'm about to finish up.

1:17:51.416 --> 1:17:54.961
Son, I feel like you're
hidin' somethin' from me.

1:17:56.588 --> 1:17:59.174
If you start experiencing
anything, you let me know.

1:18:02.636 --> 1:18:03.595
You let her know.

1:19:01.278 --> 1:19:05.073
Thanks for the tin of tobacco. Funny.

1:19:05.949 --> 1:19:10.120
I got you a beer, okay? Cheers.

1:19:13.165 --> 1:19:14.791
Ya know, it's been bothering me.

1:19:16.710 --> 1:19:18.420
I never asked you how you met Mom,

1:19:19.671 --> 1:19:22.215
where you guys went on
your first date and...

1:21:09.823 --> 1:21:12.325
This can't be happening.

1:21:25.589 --> 1:21:27.173
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:21:52.824 --> 1:21:55.493
Tom, I compared both your noggins.

1:21:56.369 --> 1:21:58.830
It varies by 30%.

1:21:58.830 --> 1:21:59.748
That's because it-

1:22:00.749 --> 1:22:02.542
Listen, before you say
that's because the brain's

1:22:02.542 --> 1:22:05.003
always changing, yes, it is, okay,

1:22:05.003 --> 1:22:07.005
but not by that much in just a week, Tom.

1:22:07.005 --> 1:22:08.965
I mean 10, 15 years maybe, but,

1:22:10.342 --> 1:22:12.886
I mean, just look at this, okay.

1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:19.184
Now, this is your brain compared to mine.

1:22:20.477 --> 1:22:23.229
I ain't gotta tell you what's goin' on.

1:22:23.229 --> 1:22:25.190
My mind is eatin' away at your brain

1:22:25.190 --> 1:22:28.610
and your memories are
gettin' corrupted.

1:22:31.404 --> 1:22:34.074
You ain't never seen this bridge before.

1:22:34.074 --> 1:22:35.575
I took your mom here on
our first date, okay.

1:22:35.575 --> 1:22:37.243
This is the Trinity River Bridge.

1:22:37.243 --> 1:22:38.954
And this. This?

1:22:39.871 --> 1:22:41.790
I etched this on my
best friend's pencil box

1:22:41.790 --> 1:22:44.125
before he passed away
back in the fourth grade.

1:22:45.627 --> 1:22:47.629
I don't know what this is.

1:22:48.546 --> 1:22:51.675
Tom, these ain't your nightmares, okay?

1:22:55.553 --> 1:22:59.474
These are my memories, and my brain is,

1:22:59.474 --> 1:23:01.267
my brain's corrupting your cerebrum.

1:23:05.063 --> 1:23:07.399
Tom, you gotta stop loadin' me.

1:23:07.399 --> 1:23:10.276
Okay, the 30% variation, that can cause

1:23:10.276 --> 1:23:12.070
serious risk to your life.

1:23:15.323 --> 1:23:16.866
I can't lose you for my quest.

1:23:19.077 --> 1:23:20.912
Stop loading me.

1:23:22.497 --> 1:23:23.331
I have to go.

1:23:24.958 --> 1:23:25.875
I love you, son.

1:23:30.964 --> 1:23:34.551
- So, what are Waylon
and Shooter up to today?

1:23:37.470 --> 1:23:39.931
Waylon and Shooter? Jennings?

1:23:39.931 --> 1:23:41.433
- No.

1:23:41.433 --> 1:23:42.267
- Forget it.

1:23:43.101 --> 1:23:43.935
What'd your dad say?

1:23:43.935 --> 1:23:45.061
- Uh, nothing.

1:23:45.061 --> 1:23:46.604
Look at this.

1:23:46.604 --> 1:23:49.274
You ain't never seen this bridge before.

1:23:49.274 --> 1:23:50.775
I took your mom here on
our first date, okay.

1:23:50.775 --> 1:23:52.152
This is the Trinity River Bridge.

1:23:52.152 --> 1:23:54.988
And this. This?

1:23:54.988 --> 1:23:56.948
I etched this on my
best friend's pencil box

1:23:56.948 --> 1:23:59.325
before he passed away
back in the fourth grade.

1:24:00.827 --> 1:24:02.662
I don't know what this is.

1:24:02.662 --> 1:24:04.122
- Wait a second.

1:24:07.917 --> 1:24:09.169
Where are these drawings?

1:24:10.336 --> 1:24:11.838
- I threw 'em away.

1:24:11.838 --> 1:24:12.756
I don't know what he did with them.

1:24:12.756 --> 1:24:14.299
- How did you know about them?

1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:18.178
- They keep showin' up in my nightmares.

1:24:18.178 --> 1:24:20.555
I don't think I've seen 'em anywhere.

1:24:23.975 --> 1:24:25.602
What are you doing?

1:24:32.275 --> 1:24:34.694
How is it that you
drew the same thing I drew?

1:24:40.617 --> 1:24:41.910
- I don't know.

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:44.120
Well, that's your math test.
My dad probably saw it.

1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:45.455
- No, no, look.

1:24:46.664 --> 1:24:47.916
I scored a 40 on this.

1:24:48.792 --> 1:24:51.503
I didn't show it to him
'cause I knew he'd be pissed.

1:24:51.503 --> 1:24:53.755
Wait, so he ain't ever seen this?

1:24:55.924 --> 1:24:57.467
- You could bet the ranch on it.

1:25:01.638 --> 1:25:02.972
- Okay, that doesn't make any sense.

1:25:02.972 --> 1:25:05.433
If he ain't never seen
it, I've never seen it,

1:25:05.433 --> 1:25:07.477
then why does it keep
showin' up in my nightmares?

1:25:09.562 --> 1:25:11.064
Did someone at the bar see it?

1:25:12.023 --> 1:25:14.776
- I mean, I've had it at the bar.

1:25:14.776 --> 1:25:16.152
I'm sure it's possible.

1:25:17.695 --> 1:25:18.530
- Let's go.

1:25:18.530 --> 1:25:21.282
- Where are we going?
- Let's go.

1:25:22.534 --> 1:25:25.078
- Okay, driving like a madman
isn't gonna solve anything.

1:25:25.078 --> 1:25:27.455
- Do you have access to
the cameras at your bar?

1:25:27.455 --> 1:25:28.373
- Yes. Why?

1:25:28.373 --> 1:25:29.916
- Because I wanna see who
else was there that night.

1:25:29.916 --> 1:25:32.293
I mean, someone had to see your drawing.

1:25:32.293 --> 1:25:34.212
- Okay, even if someone
did see my drawings,

1:25:34.212 --> 1:25:35.130
how did it end up in your dreams?

1:25:35.130 --> 1:25:35.964
- I don't know!

1:25:35.964 --> 1:25:37.841
Okay, right now I have way more questions

1:25:37.841 --> 1:25:39.134
than I have answers, just like you.

1:25:39.134 --> 1:25:40.635
- Okay, well slow down.

1:25:46.975 --> 1:25:47.976
It's not turning on.

1:25:51.146 --> 1:25:51.980
Damn it.

1:25:53.898 --> 1:25:55.358
You got any receipts?

1:25:55.358 --> 1:25:56.943
Yeah.

1:26:07.662 --> 1:26:08.746
- Are these by date?

1:26:08.746 --> 1:26:10.373
- Yeah.

1:26:10.373 --> 1:26:12.250
- Gimme that test out
of your bag right there,

1:26:12.250 --> 1:26:15.170
I wanna see what day you drew that.

1:26:18.882 --> 1:26:21.467
- There, it was June 4th.

1:26:21.467 --> 1:26:24.220
- That was the day before my dad died.

1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:26.139
Where do you keep his receipts?

1:26:28.725 --> 1:26:30.268
- In here.

1:26:30.268 --> 1:26:32.854
- Find me a stack from June 4th.

1:26:37.609 --> 1:26:39.194
- Got it, June 4th.

1:26:50.788 --> 1:26:51.623
What?

1:26:53.249 --> 1:26:54.125
Reinhard Kindler.

1:26:55.251 --> 1:26:56.085
Who's that?

1:26:58.755 --> 1:27:00.381
- He worked for my dad.

1:27:00.381 --> 1:27:02.884
- Okay, so he met your dad here.

1:27:02.884 --> 1:27:04.219
- No, no, my dad kicked
him out of his lab.

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:06.262
He woulda never met him here.

1:27:06.262 --> 1:27:08.389
- Yeah, well, it looked he had company.

1:27:10.558 --> 1:27:11.392
Look.

1:27:14.771 --> 1:27:15.605
- Bruno.

1:27:18.107 --> 1:27:21.069
- Okay, well, let's say
Bruno did see my sketch.

1:27:21.069 --> 1:27:23.238
I mean still, how did you...

1:27:35.625 --> 1:27:36.918
What are you looking for?

1:27:36.918 --> 1:27:39.170
- They think I'm so stupid.

1:27:44.634 --> 1:27:46.844
- Son of a bitch.

1:27:54.060 --> 1:27:57.480
- So, this is the video
that the cop showed you?

1:27:57.480 --> 1:27:59.107
- Yeah. Just hold on.

1:28:03.444 --> 1:28:05.655
- I've never seen you
bite your nails before.

1:28:05.655 --> 1:28:08.032
- That's because I don't. Bruno does.

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:20.336
- Wait, so Bruno killed your dad?

1:28:22.755 --> 1:28:24.382
Don't you know what this means?

1:28:24.382 --> 1:28:26.259
This means that you didn't kill your dad.

1:28:26.259 --> 1:28:29.679
This means you're not guilty.
They can't arrest you.

1:28:32.932 --> 1:28:35.059
- The video clearly shows me killing him.

1:28:35.059 --> 1:28:37.603
I mean, my fingerprints are everywhere.

1:28:37.603 --> 1:28:40.023
I mean, how am I supposed to
prove that I didn't do it?

1:28:41.482 --> 1:28:44.027
- Can't you just show the
court how the Mint works?

1:28:44.027 --> 1:28:46.904
- No, the FDA, the CDC,
this is all illegal to them.

1:28:47.822 --> 1:28:49.699
They won't let me use illegal
research in a court of law.

1:28:49.699 --> 1:28:50.616
It's inadmissible.

1:28:53.369 --> 1:28:54.829
Square one. Great.

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:11.179
- Look, there should be
something that we could do.

1:29:11.179 --> 1:29:12.430
The truth is on our side.

1:29:13.306 --> 1:29:15.641
- Yeah, well, sometimes
that's not enough, hon.

1:29:16.851 --> 1:29:18.811
There's nothin' more we can do, nothin'

1:29:21.647 --> 1:29:23.566
I gotta tell my dad what happened.

1:29:24.484 --> 1:29:26.402
He deserves to know the truth at least.

1:29:28.946 --> 1:29:30.615
You didn't die of a heart attack.

1:29:31.991 --> 1:29:34.327
You were murdered, strangled by me.

1:29:35.703 --> 1:29:36.537
- Tom, stop.

1:29:37.747 --> 1:29:38.748
Okay, you know what your dad said.

1:29:38.748 --> 1:29:41.667
You might've already damaged
yourself beyond repair.

1:29:41.667 --> 1:29:43.252
- Bruno and Rocky had
somethin' to do with it.

1:29:43.252 --> 1:29:46.255
I just don't know how to prove it.

1:29:51.094 --> 1:29:53.179
I'm sorry for hating you.

1:29:54.555 --> 1:29:57.892
I'm sorry for letting you down
and I'm sorry for everything.

1:29:58.768 --> 1:30:00.061
I love you so much.

1:30:03.147 --> 1:30:04.482
You get to be with Mom now.

1:30:07.693 --> 1:30:09.654
I'll see ya soon.

1:30:24.627 --> 1:30:26.087
I love you so much.

1:30:29.298 --> 1:30:30.842
And you get to be with Mom now.

1:30:33.761 --> 1:30:34.595
I'll see ya soon.

1:30:39.976 --> 1:30:41.477
- Hey.

1:30:41.477 --> 1:30:42.395
- Hey, hon.

1:30:44.147 --> 1:30:48.025
- Look, I'm sorry for
everything, Mr. Kirk.

1:30:49.152 --> 1:30:51.654
- You didn't do a thing wrong.

1:30:52.947 --> 1:30:55.783
Now, gimme a second in here.

1:30:55.783 --> 1:30:57.618
I need to record somethin' for Tom.

1:30:59.412 --> 1:31:00.246
- Okay.
- Hey.

1:31:01.247 --> 1:31:03.624
Thank you for everything.

1:31:05.293 --> 1:31:06.502
You take care of my boy.

1:31:07.837 --> 1:31:08.963
Don't forget to study.

1:31:10.882 --> 1:31:13.926
- I will.

1:31:13.926 --> 1:31:15.344
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:31:15.344 --> 1:31:17.096
- I'll see ya in a minute.

1:31:17.096 --> 1:31:17.930
- Okay.

1:31:43.372 --> 1:31:44.207
- I know.

1:31:45.291 --> 1:31:47.710
I know Rocky had somethin' to do with it.

1:31:47.710 --> 1:31:48.836
No doubt in my mind.

1:31:49.712 --> 1:31:52.006
Greed's always motivated that man.

1:31:52.006 --> 1:31:53.382
Morals never got in his way.

1:32:02.391 --> 1:32:03.601
I'm so proud of you.

1:32:07.063 --> 1:32:09.649
I'm so proud of you, Tom.

1:32:11.651 --> 1:32:13.194
And I'm thankful that I got to spend

1:32:13.194 --> 1:32:14.529
the last few days with you.

1:32:20.409 --> 1:32:21.619
I spent 20 years

1:32:25.164 --> 1:32:27.333
tryin' to save everyone's
precious memories.

1:32:29.585 --> 1:32:31.921
I done went and forgot to create my own.

1:32:44.475 --> 1:32:45.309
The videos of your mother,

1:32:45.309 --> 1:32:50.064
those are the first real little noggins.

1:32:52.024 --> 1:32:55.570
And you save those and
you use 'em as motivation.

1:33:00.199 --> 1:33:01.826
I wish I had more time with you.

1:33:04.620 --> 1:33:06.914
I would have taught you the Kirk slider.

1:33:37.361 --> 1:33:39.947
This the end of the road, Tom.

1:33:43.367 --> 1:33:45.953
It was just a unrealized dream.

1:33:52.293 --> 1:33:53.628
An unfinished quest.

1:33:59.216 --> 1:34:00.635
Just a path to nowhere.

1:34:19.570 --> 1:34:22.031
I'm proud of you, proud of you.

1:34:26.661 --> 1:34:28.954
You're gonna do somethin' in life.

1:34:40.716 --> 1:34:42.218
I love you, son.

1:34:42.218 --> 1:34:43.803
- Hey, is everything okay?

1:35:00.069 --> 1:35:01.153
Are you okay?

1:35:01.153 --> 1:35:02.947
- I don't know what happened.

1:35:23.134 --> 1:35:25.219
You know that
Bruno's not gonna talk to you,

1:35:25.219 --> 1:35:28.806
and he's sure as hell not gonna
own up to killing your dad.

1:35:29.765 --> 1:35:33.018
- Well, he might not talk to
me, but he will talk to Rocky.

1:35:48.284 --> 1:35:50.244
You really think
he's gonna fall for that?

1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:54.749
- As long as there's money involved, yeah.

1:36:09.096 --> 1:36:10.765
- Okay. So now what?

1:36:12.391 --> 1:36:15.811
- I'm gonna lure Rocky here,
we'll bring him inside,

1:36:15.811 --> 1:36:19.106
and we'll take him down
and load my backup to him.

1:36:19.106 --> 1:36:21.150
- How are we gonna take him down?

1:36:25.112 --> 1:36:26.614
- You're gonna have to seduce him.

1:36:26.614 --> 1:36:29.575
Not even seduce, actually,
just flirt with him.

1:36:29.575 --> 1:36:31.744
I mean, you know how to flirt, right?

1:36:31.744 --> 1:36:33.037
- I wasn't born yesterday.

1:36:33.996 --> 1:36:35.873
- We're gonna upload my backup.

1:36:35.873 --> 1:36:37.541
I'm gonna go as Rocky, talk to Bruno,

1:36:37.541 --> 1:36:39.084
pull the confession out of him.

1:36:40.169 --> 1:36:42.963
Before we do that though,
I need to make a backup.

1:36:44.632 --> 1:36:45.633
Hand me those pills.

1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:54.141
- Do you really think this is legit?

1:36:54.141 --> 1:36:55.351
I mean, there's no way that Tom

1:36:55.351 --> 1:36:57.311
finished the research on his own.

1:36:57.311 --> 1:36:58.729
Hey, no wasting, right?

1:36:59.605 --> 1:37:02.399
- Look at the code
samples on the algorithm.

1:37:02.399 --> 1:37:04.401
This is definitely new
work. No doubt about it.

1:37:04.401 --> 1:37:06.654
- Okay, but we took all the
important research materials

1:37:06.654 --> 1:37:08.155
from the lab.

1:37:08.155 --> 1:37:10.866
- That may be true, but the
goose that laid the golden egg

1:37:10.866 --> 1:37:13.285
just landed in our lap for a second time.

1:37:15.579 --> 1:37:19.208
- I'm not sure that I follow.

1:37:22.336 --> 1:37:26.382
- Okay, listen, Darjeeling
Limited, emphasis on the limited,

1:37:26.382 --> 1:37:28.217
we will test the Mint.

1:37:28.217 --> 1:37:30.886
- If it works, like he says it should,

1:37:30.886 --> 1:37:33.556
we will take it from him.

1:37:33.556 --> 1:37:35.850
- He's not just gonna hand
it over to you, is he?

1:37:35.850 --> 1:37:37.309
No Bruno, he's not.

1:37:41.605 --> 1:37:43.399
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

1:37:43.399 --> 1:37:44.400
Okay, you're not expecting me

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:46.360
to surrogate load Tom again, are you?

1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:47.528
- Exactly.

1:37:47.528 --> 1:37:49.864
- I'm sorry, but that's
not gonna happen, okay?

1:37:49.864 --> 1:37:52.157
Ever since you loaded
that dog brain onto me,

1:37:52.157 --> 1:37:54.076
I've been dreaming in muted colors, okay?

1:37:54.076 --> 1:37:55.327
So, I'm sorry, but no.

1:37:57.580 --> 1:38:00.499
- What if I doubled what
I gave you last time?

1:38:01.876 --> 1:38:02.710
- No.

1:38:04.837 --> 1:38:06.380
- Okay.

1:38:06.380 --> 1:38:07.673
How about if I tripled it?

1:38:11.594 --> 1:38:15.639
A hundred and fifty grand
buys a few nice rice rockets.

1:38:17.016 --> 1:38:18.559
It's a no brainer, Speed Racer.

1:38:25.316 --> 1:38:26.901
- Okay, sure.

1:38:37.202 --> 1:38:39.204
- Oh, mornin', hon.

1:38:39.204 --> 1:38:40.039
- Morning.

1:38:41.707 --> 1:38:43.542
How'd you sleep, Mr. Kirk?

1:38:43.542 --> 1:38:45.210
- Tossed and turned all night.

1:38:45.210 --> 1:38:46.545
What about you?

1:38:46.545 --> 1:38:47.379
- Yeah, me too.

1:38:48.672 --> 1:38:49.924
Feelin' a little jittery.

1:38:51.091 --> 1:38:52.426
We'll be all right.

1:38:57.139 --> 1:38:57.973
- Tom?

1:38:58.974 --> 1:38:59.808
- Yep.

1:39:03.938 --> 1:39:04.772
You okay?

1:39:11.236 --> 1:39:16.116
Thank you for everything
you've done for me and my dad.

1:39:17.201 --> 1:39:19.078
I mean, if everything goes, well, if,

1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:23.248
maybe we can do that second date.

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:26.794
Ya know?

1:39:35.511 --> 1:39:36.637
Hey, Bruno, what's up?

1:39:36.637 --> 1:39:38.097
Hey, Tom, how are you?

1:39:38.097 --> 1:39:39.473
- I'm good.

1:39:39.473 --> 1:39:40.933
You talk to Rocky yet?

1:39:40.933 --> 1:39:42.476
Listen, could
you meet me at the bar

1:39:42.476 --> 1:39:44.311
in about 10 minutes?

1:39:44.311 --> 1:39:45.813
Got something important to discuss.

1:39:45.813 --> 1:39:47.856
- Right now? No, man, I can't.

1:39:47.856 --> 1:39:51.235
It's about Rocky.
I'll see ya there in 10.

1:39:51.235 --> 1:39:53.237
- What was that about?

1:39:53.237 --> 1:39:55.656
- That was Bruno. He wants
me to meet him at the bar.

1:39:56.573 --> 1:39:57.408
- I'm coming.

1:40:26.478 --> 1:40:28.814
- Hey, Tom. How's it goin'?

1:40:28.814 --> 1:40:29.648
- Good.

1:40:29.648 --> 1:40:31.525
- So, I heard you made some
progress on the research.

1:40:31.525 --> 1:40:32.359
- I did.

1:40:34.862 --> 1:40:37.865
- Well, first off, I
really wanna thank you.

1:40:44.997 --> 1:40:46.540
- Yo, what are you?

1:40:46.540 --> 1:40:47.374
- I'm really sorry about this.

1:40:47.374 --> 1:40:49.251
- Bruno, stop!

1:40:49.251 --> 1:40:52.129
- I tried showing you
the good side of life.

1:40:52.129 --> 1:40:54.715
Then you went all Dalai Lama on me.

1:40:54.715 --> 1:40:56.300
- Come on!

1:41:00.596 --> 1:41:05.434
I mean, really, man, how do
you say no to a '66 Vette, huh?

1:41:05.434 --> 1:41:07.644
- You just think you're so...

1:41:07.644 --> 1:41:09.104
Think you're so...

1:41:42.096 --> 1:41:42.930
- Tom!

1:41:44.473 --> 1:41:46.391
Hey, are you okay?

1:41:47.768 --> 1:41:48.894
Tom!

1:41:48.894 --> 1:41:49.728
- That's you.

1:41:51.188 --> 1:41:52.564
Tell her you're almost done!

1:41:54.650 --> 1:41:55.567
- I'm almost done.

1:42:05.077 --> 1:42:05.911
- Okay, okay.

1:42:05.911 --> 1:42:09.206
So, I go back to the farm, I get the Mint,

1:42:09.206 --> 1:42:10.499
and I bring it back to you.

1:42:10.499 --> 1:42:11.333
- That's right.

1:42:11.333 --> 1:42:14.586
And to me and to no one else, okay?

1:42:14.586 --> 1:42:15.671
- Okay, I got it.

1:42:15.671 --> 1:42:17.923
- Okay, now get out of
here before TICS sets it.

1:42:17.923 --> 1:42:18.715
- How?

1:42:18.715 --> 1:42:19.800
- Just check your pockets.

1:42:24.721 --> 1:42:25.597
- Nice.

1:42:34.648 --> 1:42:36.316
- Hey! Tom, hey!

1:42:36.316 --> 1:42:41.321
Where are you going?

1:42:48.871 --> 1:42:51.039
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1:43:04.553 --> 1:43:06.138
Rocky, this is Bruno.

1:43:06.138 --> 1:43:08.599
I asked Tom to meet me
at the Rusty Tavern.

1:43:08.599 --> 1:43:10.726
I'm waiting outside. Meet me here.

1:43:16.607 --> 1:43:18.275
- Did you call Tom?

1:43:18.275 --> 1:43:19.109
- Yeah.

1:43:20.235 --> 1:43:21.486
When is he coming?

1:43:21.486 --> 1:43:24.364
- He already did. I surrogate loaded him.

1:43:24.364 --> 1:43:27.451
- Really? Nicely done Potter boy.

1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:31.121
- 150Ks isn't gonna cut it.

1:43:32.331 --> 1:43:33.624
I want at least 2 million.

1:43:35.375 --> 1:43:36.210
- Excuse me?

1:43:37.586 --> 1:43:39.087
- You and I both know that a hold time

1:43:39.087 --> 1:43:41.715
that's over 18 hours is worth millions.

1:43:43.675 --> 1:43:44.509
- I see.

1:43:47.304 --> 1:43:48.805
And if I don't pay?

1:43:49.932 --> 1:43:51.391
I'll call the sheik.

1:43:53.227 --> 1:43:54.978
- You think you're smart, huh?

1:43:54.978 --> 1:43:56.563
A real brainiac?

1:43:56.563 --> 1:43:58.440
- I'd like to think so, yeah.

1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:01.360
- Do you know the inferior brain paradox?

1:44:03.904 --> 1:44:06.406
The less it knows, the
more it thinks it knows.

1:44:18.252 --> 1:44:20.754
- My surrogate's never
gonna give you that device.

1:44:21.838 --> 1:44:23.465
- That may be.

1:44:23.465 --> 1:44:24.675
So put your hands there.

1:44:28.971 --> 1:44:31.473
Now, this is what we will use.

1:44:40.357 --> 1:44:41.733
- You selfish pig.

1:44:41.733 --> 1:44:45.028
- Maybe, but you know what
happens with selfless pigs?

1:46:18.914 --> 1:46:19.748
- Howdy.

1:46:30.801 --> 1:46:33.804
Can I get ya anything? A beer maybe?

1:46:38.475 --> 1:46:40.519
What kinda beer is that?

1:46:40.519 --> 1:46:42.354
- It's not a beer, my
,

1:46:42.354 --> 1:46:43.522
it's you.

1:46:43.522 --> 1:46:45.357
You're beautiful.

1:46:45.357 --> 1:46:48.777
Thank you.

1:46:52.155 --> 1:46:54.032
You know, we're inside, right?

1:46:57.285 --> 1:46:59.037
- Thank you.

1:46:59.037 --> 1:47:03.917
- Wow, you have beautiful eyes.

1:47:04.793 --> 1:47:05.877
- I've been told.

1:47:05.877 --> 1:47:07.421
- You have?

1:47:07.421 --> 1:47:08.713
Why am I not surprised.

1:47:10.715 --> 1:47:14.136
Wow, I could just stare into them all day.

1:47:16.888 --> 1:47:18.640
Oh, I'm up here.

1:47:34.990 --> 1:47:36.032
You feelin' okay?

1:47:37.492 --> 1:47:38.326
- You.

1:47:39.327 --> 1:47:42.873
- And you thought you could
get away with killing my Kirk.

1:47:42.873 --> 1:47:43.707
- You.

1:47:47.544 --> 1:47:48.378
- Adios.

1:48:10.484 --> 1:48:11.985
- Okay, where'd you say he is?

1:48:13.153 --> 1:48:14.279
- Outside in his car.

1:48:16.823 --> 1:48:18.116
- Quick, gimme your phone.

1:48:19.284 --> 1:48:20.118
Come on, gimme your phone.

1:48:20.118 --> 1:48:20.952
- Okay.

1:48:26.208 --> 1:48:27.667
- What? We're out of options.

1:48:27.667 --> 1:48:28.793
This is all we've got.

1:48:30.253 --> 1:48:31.046
- I don't know.

1:48:32.464 --> 1:48:33.381
It's risky.

1:48:34.633 --> 1:48:35.634
Look, you don't have to do this.

1:48:35.634 --> 1:48:37.844
Oh, I do, for my dad.

1:48:43.350 --> 1:48:44.768
- I wanna ask you somethin'.

1:48:49.189 --> 1:48:50.941
- What happened to Kirk that night?

1:48:52.943 --> 1:48:54.611
- What's going on?

1:48:54.611 --> 1:48:56.613
Is this TICS setting in?

1:48:56.613 --> 1:48:57.405
- Just tell me.

1:48:58.990 --> 1:49:00.283
- Get back inside.

1:49:01.701 --> 1:49:02.619
- I need answers.

1:49:02.619 --> 1:49:03.745
- I'll go get the Mint.

1:49:03.745 --> 1:49:05.080
- Bruno.
- Just stay put.

1:49:05.956 --> 1:49:06.790
I'm not Bruno.

1:49:06.790 --> 1:49:08.667
- Bruno, wait. Bruno, wait!

1:49:11.628 --> 1:49:14.047
- Hey! Hey, what happened?

1:49:14.047 --> 1:49:15.674
- We gotta get to the farm now.

1:49:15.674 --> 1:49:16.550
- How?

1:49:16.550 --> 1:49:17.926
- Get in.
- Okay.

1:49:45.870 --> 1:49:47.789
911, state your emergency.

1:49:47.789 --> 1:49:49.791
- Hi, I'd like to report
a possible shooting

1:49:49.791 --> 1:49:51.751
at Blue Mountain Farms in Elgin.

1:49:52.711 --> 1:49:54.296
Sir, are you safe?

1:49:54.296 --> 1:49:55.505
- Yes.

1:49:55.505 --> 1:49:57.591
Do you need medical-

1:50:12.814 --> 1:50:14.190
- What are you doing here?

1:50:14.190 --> 1:50:15.650
Why aren't you at the bar?

1:50:15.650 --> 1:50:17.569
- I need to ask you something.

1:50:17.569 --> 1:50:19.863
- I don't have time
for this. Just go back.

1:50:19.863 --> 1:50:22.657
- Tell me this one thing and
I'll do whatever you want.

1:50:22.657 --> 1:50:24.034
You've got to be kidding me.

1:50:24.034 --> 1:50:26.286
- What did you to Kirk?

1:50:26.286 --> 1:50:28.496
- This is what you want to know right now?

1:50:28.496 --> 1:50:30.999
- What happened to Kirk that night?

1:50:30.999 --> 1:50:31.833
- Okay, okay.

1:50:33.752 --> 1:50:37.047
I asked Bruno to surrogate load
onto Tom to steal the Mint.

1:50:37.047 --> 1:50:39.633
He ran into Dr. Kirk,
panicked, and killed him.

1:50:44.137 --> 1:50:46.056
- You killed Dr. Kirk Davis?

1:50:46.056 --> 1:50:47.140
- No, no, not me.

1:50:47.140 --> 1:50:49.100
Bruno did.

1:50:59.861 --> 1:51:03.281
- What are you doing here? We had a deal.

1:51:05.909 --> 1:51:07.327
- Gimme the laptop and files.

1:51:08.662 --> 1:51:10.163
- No, no, no, give them to me.

1:51:15.001 --> 1:51:16.002
- Wait, who are you?

1:51:17.379 --> 1:51:19.714
- I don't have time to play who's who?

1:51:19.714 --> 1:51:22.884
Give me the laptop.
Goddamn it, we had a plan!

1:51:25.804 --> 1:51:28.473
- Okay, if I can't reason with you,

1:51:28.473 --> 1:51:30.225
then maybe you'll reason with this.

1:51:33.395 --> 1:51:36.856
Give me the laptop or
I'll blow your brains out.

1:51:58.128 --> 1:52:00.630
- Get back, step back. Step back!

1:52:03.550 --> 1:52:05.760
- Look, look, look, Rocky, I'm sorry.

1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:06.970
I shouldn't have asked for more money.

1:52:06.970 --> 1:52:09.806
We can just keep the original
deal and I'll walk away.

1:52:09.806 --> 1:52:13.643
- No, no more deals. Give me
the laptop and my body back.

1:52:15.645 --> 1:52:16.479
- Tom?

1:52:19.482 --> 1:52:22.610
I had nothing to do with this, okay.

1:52:22.610 --> 1:52:24.446
He killed your father.

1:52:24.446 --> 1:52:27.073
I promise if you let me go
you'll never see me again.

1:52:27.073 --> 1:52:27.866
I'll disappear.

1:52:30.994 --> 1:52:33.163
- You sleazy worm. Come here.

1:52:34.748 --> 1:52:36.750
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:52:36.750 --> 1:52:37.834
We can still get outta this.

1:52:37.834 --> 1:52:38.668
- How?

1:52:38.668 --> 1:52:41.212
- The phone. It's in my pocket.

1:52:41.212 --> 1:52:43.965
And the cops are on
their way. Do the math!

1:52:54.559 --> 1:52:56.811
We have him dead to rights.

1:52:57.687 --> 1:52:58.980
Know this, my boy.

1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:02.275
As you go, so goes your father's work.

1:53:02.275 --> 1:53:05.111
Mad lab assistant kills scientist father.

1:53:05.111 --> 1:53:07.447
Sentenced to life.

1:53:09.866 --> 1:53:13.787
Every second, of every
minute of every hour

1:53:13.787 --> 1:53:15.580
of every day your father devoted his life

1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:17.415
to memory transfer technology.

1:53:17.415 --> 1:53:22.295
It goes away with you.

1:53:22.295 --> 1:53:23.880
- Drop your weapon.

1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:24.714
Drop it now!

1:53:26.049 --> 1:53:26.925
Drop your weapon.

1:53:27.884 --> 1:53:30.386
That'll be your legacy.

1:53:30.386 --> 1:53:32.096
- Hey, I said I'll shoot.

1:53:32.096 --> 1:53:34.474
- Oh, you're smarter than that, Tom.

1:53:34.474 --> 1:53:35.433
You won't shoot yourself.

1:53:35.433 --> 1:53:37.811
- You're only as good as
the promises you make.

1:53:39.729 --> 1:53:42.273
And I promised my father
I'd continue his research.

1:53:43.483 --> 1:53:44.442
- Drop your weapon!

1:53:45.443 --> 1:53:46.236
- Shoot me.

1:53:48.154 --> 1:53:49.489
Kill yourself.

1:53:52.534 --> 1:53:55.495
Face it, you can't kill yourself, Tom.

1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:00.458
I can't shoot you, but...

1:54:05.463 --> 1:54:06.714
- Step away from the weapon.

1:54:06.714 --> 1:54:08.466
Drop it, step away, step away.

1:54:08.466 --> 1:54:10.051
Get down. Get down, get down, get down.

1:54:10.051 --> 1:54:12.262
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

1:54:12.262 --> 1:54:15.014
- Get down!

1:54:15.014 --> 1:54:17.517
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:54:17.517 --> 1:54:18.351
No! No!

1:54:19.769 --> 1:54:21.729
I got him, son, I got him.

1:54:21.729 --> 1:54:22.564
- No!

1:54:31.281 --> 1:54:32.740
An eye for an eye.

1:55:05.690 --> 1:55:07.191
Birthday, bud.

1:55:07.191 --> 1:55:08.026
- Bruno!

1:55:08.026 --> 1:55:08.902
- Bruno!

1:55:08.902 --> 1:55:10.111
- Sorry for everything.

1:55:10.111 --> 1:55:12.196
This is your
brain in digital form.

1:55:15.408 --> 1:55:16.534
Tom, are you okay?

1:55:16.534 --> 1:55:17.952
Dr. Davis.

1:55:17.952 --> 1:55:19.120
Tom.

1:57:01.931 --> 1:57:06.936
between father and son

1:57:07.145 --> 1:57:12.150
and the kingdom come

1:57:12.859 --> 1:57:17.864
till it makes me numb

1:57:33.379 --> 1:57:37.300
sure will be his last

1:57:48.561 --> 1:57:52.273
has now grown numb

1:58:28.643 --> 1:58:32.814
my fists clenched tight

1:58:39.904 --> 1:58:44.033
close to the borderline

1:59:02.343 --> 1:59:06.514
born and a time to die

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:21.404
war and a time for peace

1:59:21.404 --> 1:59:25.032
and a time to speak

1:59:25.032 --> 1:59:28.870
gain and a time to lose

1:59:28.870 --> 1:59:32.456
and it's time to choose

1:59:36.127 --> 1:59:39.964
and a time to mourn

1:59:39.964 --> 1:59:43.843
and a time to build

1:59:51.434 --> 1:59:55.021
when he's been outgunned
