<i>Hello, beautiful. How are you?</i>

00:03.870 --> 00:05.070
I am here today because I'm here

00:05.105 --> 00:06.605

00:06.639 --> 00:09.208

- Um...

00:14.814 --> 00:16.181
I would love to see
a traditional dress.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.850
She's Princess Kindra.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.453
I could maybe be like
the sassy, rebellious duchess.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.055
You know, I gotta be able
to like...

00:23.089 --> 00:24.623
<i>Kindra grew up in church.</i>

00:24.657 --> 00:27.292
She's a church girl

00:27.327 --> 00:28.961
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

00:28.995 --> 00:30.229
I'm okay.

00:30.263 --> 00:31.764
<i>My mom's trying to find a dress</i>

00:31.798 --> 00:33.732
that's going to make me
look like the Virgin Mary.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.667
Kindra.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.870
Oh, mom found a dress.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.071

- Let me see.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.606
What do you think about this?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.374
- She liked it. She liked it.
- Oh, she likes this one?

00:42.409 --> 00:43.942
Not gonna happen.

Uh-oh.

00:52.452 --> 00:56.455
Did we just transform you
to a fitted dress person?

00:56.489 --> 00:58.624
Surprise.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.292
It's too plain.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.694
At this point,
I don't know what to do.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.029
I'm so confused.

Okay. I've got some

I wanna put up on the wall.

That's what she wanted.

Oh, my goodness.
I'm gonna start crying.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.546
[screams] I'm leaving
with the Randy dress.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.115
- I hope you know that.
- Which dress?

03:03.149 --> 03:04.750
I want your Anastasia dress.

[Randy]<i> Oh, the Anastasia?</i>

Yes. Oh my goodness.
I love that dress so much.

Who do you have with you today?

03:15.628 --> 03:17.062
Introduce me to the family.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.931
- I have my beautiful mom.
- Hi, Randy.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.799
<i>Hi, mom. How are you, beautiful?</i>

03:20.833 --> 03:22.467
- [Jodie] Hi.
- And I'm Michelle.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.437
- I'm the groom's mom.
- My mother-in-law.

03:25.471 --> 03:28.607
<i>Welcome. Anastasia
is definitely a gown</i>

03:28.641 --> 03:32.077
<i>for a girl that wants to be
that Cinderella princess</i>

<i>on her wedding day and wants
something really grand...</i>

03:34.647 --> 03:36.748
- Yes.
- [Randy] ...and over the top.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.083
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm over the top.

03:38.117 --> 03:39.952
I... All of this
is over the top.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.286
[laughter]

03:41.321 --> 03:42.721
They trying to, like,
simmer me down

03:42.755 --> 03:44.156
and they want me walking
around like a penguin

03:44.190 --> 03:45.791
and I don't wanna walk around
like a penguin.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.660
Got it. So, you guys
are thinking more fitted?

03:48.695 --> 03:50.829
I wanna see her into
a halter top fitted gown.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.464
Oh, God. No.

03:52.498 --> 03:55.400
She works hard to have
this body and it's amazing.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.868
So... And I know
that's what my son

03:56.903 --> 03:59.404
wants to see her in also.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.708
A lot of lace, a lot of bling.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.443
I'd like to have her all lit up.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.379
- If I had my choice but...
- I'm willing to try anything

04:07.413 --> 04:09.314
but as long as I leave
with the Randy dress

04:09.349 --> 04:11.383
and I try on
the Anastasia dress.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.352
I love Randy because
he knows what a bride needs.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.120
I want to make an entrance
when I walk in

04:15.154 --> 04:16.989
<i>and he makes a perfect dress
for that.</i>

04:17.023 --> 04:20.192
<i>So I have a few dresses
I wanna recommend, Kelsey,</i>

04:20.226 --> 04:23.462
<i>that I'm thinking so
of course there's Anastasia,</i>

04:23.496 --> 04:25.163
<i>and if she still loves
a ball gown,</i>

04:25.198 --> 04:28.767
<i>I have the new one
called Brussels. It's there.</i>

04:28.801 --> 04:32.204
Now, if she wants something
more fitted with an overskirt,

04:32.238 --> 04:35.440
<i>I... And lots of glitz
and sparkle,</i>

04:35.475 --> 04:37.609
<i>I would definitely go
with Bristol.</i>

04:37.644 --> 04:39.378
We want it to go viral.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.046
- [Randy] Viral.
- Our dress has to go viral.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.648
For TikTok, you have two words,

04:42.682 --> 04:44.616
you either go viral
or your video flops.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.551
<i>I love it. So question, Amanda,</i>

04:46.586 --> 04:48.654
<i>how much would you like
to spend?</i>

04:48.688 --> 04:51.456
So my budget is between
$5,000 and $6,000.

04:51.491 --> 04:55.360
My fiance's Papa
who passed away,

04:55.395 --> 04:57.496
<i>who recently passed away
last year.</i>

04:57.530 --> 04:59.231
<i>He put money aside for us
before we were engaged</i>

04:59.265 --> 05:00.766
<i>because he knew I was the one.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:02.768
He fell in love with me
the first time he met me.

05:02.802 --> 05:07.339
And he told my fiance,
you better not let her go.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.941
Oh, my God. Finally.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.077
- Yay!
- [laughter]

05:12.111 --> 05:14.613
My fiance's name
is Raymond Padilla.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.115
He is... He is the love
of my life.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.417
<i>We met through
friends of friends</i>

05:18.451 --> 05:19.751
<i>and he's my best friend.</i>

05:19.786 --> 05:21.687
<i>He is my first love.</i>

05:21.721 --> 05:23.088
<i>He is the only person I know</i>

05:23.122 --> 05:24.623
<i>that can actually put up
with me.</i>

05:24.657 --> 05:27.859
I have a lot of energy,
and about two years of us

05:27.894 --> 05:29.795
being together, I told him
I'm gonna marry you.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.363
<i>Like whether you ask me
or I ask you,</i>

05:31.397 --> 05:33.832
<i>I'm gonna marry you.</i> [laughs]

05:33.866 --> 05:37.769
Mom, I'm engaged.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.771
Tell me a little bit more
about the wedding.

05:39.806 --> 05:40.906
Where is it going to be?

05:40.940 --> 05:42.074
It's gonna be in Arizona.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.342
I want a three-day wedding.

05:43.376 --> 05:44.409
- [Kelsey] Beautiful.
- Like, I'm very,

05:44.444 --> 05:45.877
- like, outgoing.
- [Kelsey] Yes.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.379
And you can't put all that
in one day.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.948
- Okay. Beautiful.
- Yes. I'm so excited.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.917
I'm going to go pull those
Randy dresses.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.385
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Of course.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.853
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.054
I think my
biggest challenge today

05:56.089 --> 05:57.756
is finding the right dress.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.091
I've never put on
a wedding dress,

05:59.125 --> 06:00.559
so I don't know
how I'm gonna look.

06:00.593 --> 06:04.763
So this one here
is a more fitted dress

06:04.797 --> 06:06.832
and it has an overskirt.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.967
So, I know her family
really wants to see her

06:09.001 --> 06:10.569
in a fitted dress.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.304
I'm definitely taking this one.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.407
- I have dresses.
- [giggles]

06:15.441 --> 06:17.175
There's a lot of skinny
dresses in there.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.077
So there are two fitted dresses.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.412
- But don't worry...
- [Amanda] Okay.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.247
- ...Anastasia is out there.
- Okay.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.281
[Kelsey] I'm going to grab her.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.216
Okay.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.425
I don't wanna try it on.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.160
Out of sight, out of mind,
you know? That's perfect.

06:35.194 --> 06:38.997
All right, Amanda, and I have
the Anastasia dress.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.332
It's so gorgeous!

06:40.366 --> 06:41.633
Oh, my goodness.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.136
This is the one
that you had seen.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.670
- [Amanda] Yes.
- A big ball gown.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.972
- Yes.
- Lots of lace.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.774
- Oh, my goodness.
- [Kelsey] Right?

06:48.808 --> 06:50.842
She's screaming my name.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.344
I'm here for you.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.479
I have the Randy Fenoli
Anastasia dress.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.415
It's gorgeous.
I love it so much.

06:56.449 --> 06:57.949
I feel like that is
honestly my dress.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.284
Okay. Perfect.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.519
Got it. Yeah. Hold on to me.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.686
This thing is perfect.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.522
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.090
This is not gonna be as heavy
once it's clipped to you.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.391
- So let me...
- Oh, okay.

07:06.426 --> 07:11.163
I'm gonna start doing
some clips.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.831
- Awesome.
- Wow.

07:12.865 --> 07:17.335
- Does that feel okay?
- This feels gorgeous.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.137
- It looks incredible on you.
- It does.

07:19.172 --> 07:23.842
I'm just not a fan
of this part right here.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.445
I'm just not...
I'm not liking it that much.

07:26.479 --> 07:30.849
Oh, no.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.717
- I love it.
- [giggles]

07:32.752 --> 07:36.688
Okay. All right.
Where do we begin?

07:36.722 --> 07:38.723
I would say I am a bit
of a risk taker

07:38.758 --> 07:40.492
because I am a beauty editor.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.060
- Is this a slit?
- [woman] That's nice.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.495
- [woman] Oh, that's a slit.
- [Kindra] Oh, yeah, see?

07:43.529 --> 07:46.331
This is what I was
talking about.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.000
[woman] [laughs]
This is not happening.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.869
I don't wanna be like
"Here comes the dress."

07:50.903 --> 07:53.305
Like I don't wanna be like that.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.540
But I need to be able to,
like, pop it and drop it low.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.309
Ooh, this is good, too.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.311
- But this is sheer.
- What?

07:59.345 --> 08:01.813
- [Kindra] It could be lined.
- It could be lined.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.615
I'm a pastor.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.417
<i>Kindra grew up in church,
you know?</i>

08:05.451 --> 08:07.719
So she's a church girl
whether she likes it or not.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.554
[laughter]

08:09.589 --> 08:12.157
I feel a little bit
outnumbered here.

08:12.191 --> 08:14.459
- Yes.
- We're all in this together.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.661
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.497
- Hello. How are you?
- How are you?

08:18.531 --> 08:20.966
- Good.
- Very good. Where's my bride?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.134
- Me. Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Kindra. Nice to meet you.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.270
My name is Jessica. Who did
you bring with you today?

08:25.304 --> 08:27.439
So today I have with me
my mother

08:27.473 --> 08:29.474
and my friend, Alexx.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.876
Alexx is gonna be
one of my bridesmaids.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.477
Hello. Hello.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.979
- I really like this outfit.
- [Jessica] Thank you.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.982
Very, very good. I love
a good jogger situation.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.485
It is a bit challenging for me
having a fashion background

08:40.520 --> 08:42.954
looking for my wedding dress,
because I wanna make sure

08:42.989 --> 08:47.659
that I'm fashionable,
but I also wanna stay classic.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.761
The things I know I love,
I love a corset.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.062
- [Jessica] Okay.
- I love a bustier.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.297
- [Jessica] Okay.
- I'm gonna be like...

08:52.331 --> 08:53.899
- I wanna be snatched...
- Absolutely.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.467
- [Kindra] ...at the top.
- Absolutely.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.701
- [Kindra] You know?
- Show the shape off, right?

08:56.736 --> 08:58.637
Yes, yes. Uh, this is great.

08:58.671 --> 08:59.971
I love the top.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.374
- But...
- It looks great.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.775
It looks great.
What's the objection?

09:03.809 --> 09:07.212
We want some material.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.147
[Kindra] She's concerned
about the sheerness.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.482
- [Jessica] Okay.
- That's why we...

09:10.516 --> 09:11.950
- Okay.
- We made a song today.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.485
- Oh, a song.
- Everything that is sheer

09:13.519 --> 09:15.153
- can be lined.
- But she won't line it.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.821
[Kindra]
This is gonna be a thing.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.557
This is gonna be a thing.
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

09:18.591 --> 09:19.991
- She's my only daughter.
- [Jessica] Oh.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.227
So she's Princess Kindra, right?

09:22.261 --> 09:24.162
- Princess Kindra.
- [all] Princess Kindra.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.530
- [Marcia] So I look...
- I don't know if I wanna feel

09:25.565 --> 09:27.132
- like a princess, though.
- Yeah.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.600
I just wanna feel...
I can maybe be like

09:28.634 --> 09:31.803
the sassy, rebellious duchess.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.038
- Oh.
- [Kindra] Maybe?

09:33.072 --> 09:34.539
- Okay, duchess.
- [Kindra] You know?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.141
- But not the...
- Do you feel this?

09:36.175 --> 09:37.876
- I'm here for this.
- I'm not feeling it at all.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.811
Every dress needs to be
twerk approved.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.279
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Yes.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.948
That's what
we're gonna be doing.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.950
You know, I gotta be able
to, like, dance in it.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.017
- Hey, okay.
- I gotta be, you know...

09:46.052 --> 09:47.819
you know a little...

09:47.853 --> 09:51.156
[Jessica] Mom is gonna have
a heart attack right now.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.557
So tell me a little bit
about your venue.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.992
Where is the wedding gonna be?

09:54.026 --> 09:55.827
It's at the New Jersey
Botanical Gardens.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.229
- [Marcia]<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>- So what is the budget today?</i>

09:58.264 --> 10:00.031
What are we kind of thinking?

10:00.066 --> 10:03.935
I would like to let it be like
$8,000 definitely and under.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.604
Emphasize on the "And."

10:05.638 --> 10:08.506
If we love the dress,
and it costs a little bit more

10:08.541 --> 10:10.008
- then...
- [Marcia] Then...

10:10.042 --> 10:11.643
...I'm sure God will work
on your heart.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.011
Then God's gonna work
on my heart.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.679
- [laughter]
- [Jessica] It's up to you.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.015
- Now we bring the Lord in.
- About generosity.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.217
The Lord is not in the dress,
but it's in my wallet.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.519
Okay. This is good. I love it.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.822
Since my parents are paying
for my dress,

10:23.856 --> 10:26.858
I definitely wanna have
something that they like.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.828
I love this top.
I love the slit.

10:29.862 --> 10:33.064
But ultimately, I think that
they should trust me enough

10:33.099 --> 10:36.201
that they'll be...
they'll be with it.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.637
And this is also similar
to that one with like,

10:38.671 --> 10:40.538
- the bustier top thing.
- And you know what's good,

10:40.573 --> 10:42.641
though, is you're having
one with full detail.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.175
- [Kindra] Mmm-hmm.
- One with detail just on top

10:44.210 --> 10:45.377
and then one that's clean.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.678
Let me grab these
and we can head

10:46.712 --> 10:48.380
right over to the room
and get started.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.048
Sounds good.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.784
So my fiance's name is Shimo.
He's amazing.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.053
He is a menswear designer.

10:55.087 --> 10:58.023
- [laughs]
- It's a wrap.

10:58.057 --> 10:58.957
- OMG.
- You see?

10:58.991 --> 11:00.358
You didn't bring one.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.227
<i>It's funny,
because when I met him,</i>

11:02.261 --> 11:03.862
I was like,
"Hi, you work in fashion,

11:03.896 --> 11:06.564
I work in fashion."
And he was like, "Okay, bye."

11:06.599 --> 11:10.101
<i>He was already decided
he didn't like fashion girls.</i>

11:10.136 --> 11:14.439
So that wasn't exactly
the hook I was looking for.

11:14.473 --> 11:18.276
<i>But later on, he came to his
senses and he slid in my DMS.</i>

11:18.310 --> 11:21.346
<i>And six weeks in,
we were shopping together</i>

11:21.380 --> 11:23.214
<i>and getting
like the same clothes.</i>

11:23.249 --> 11:26.284
<i>So we knew pretty early on
that this was different.</i>

11:26.318 --> 11:28.286
Okay. So which one is
jumping out to you the most?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.888
Which one do you
wanna start with?

11:29.922 --> 11:32.691
I think I wanna start
with the clean silhouette,

11:32.725 --> 11:33.792
- with this one.
- [Jessica] With this one.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.393
- Okay.
- [Kindra] My mom is very

11:35.428 --> 11:37.028
- concerned about me.
- [Jessica] I was just about

11:37.063 --> 11:38.763
- to say, what about mom?
- [Kindra] She's very concerned

11:38.798 --> 11:40.532
- about me like being naked.
- [Jessica] Okay.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.833
But I'm like just... I feel like

11:41.867 --> 11:43.368
she can trust me on this one.

11:43.402 --> 11:46.738
I'm so nervous right now.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.173
I can't wait to see her.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.507
- Yeah.
- What do we think so far?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.509
- Yeah, I'm into this.
- Yeah?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.178
I'm very, very much into this.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.380
Okay.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.850
I really think you're
gonna be surprised.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.452
Because I know... I understand.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.187
You're, like,
absolutely no skin, no skin.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.421
- No. Yeah.
- I get that.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.157
Every mom doesn't
wanna see that.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.126
- [Alexx] Look at the leg.
- Oh, my God.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.360
- Come through.
- [laughter]

12:09.395 --> 12:11.162
I love it.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.630
- I told her the fitted one...
- I like it,

12:12.665 --> 12:14.265
but I don't like the train.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.168
That's the best part.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.670
Where is your belt?

12:18.704 --> 12:19.938
[Kelsey T]
There is a belt and...

12:19.972 --> 12:24.743
[Evangelista speaking]

12:24.777 --> 12:26.010
That's not good.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.283
[dramatic music playing]

12:32.318 --> 12:34.753
[indistinct chatter]

12:34.787 --> 12:35.954
Wow.

12:35.988 --> 12:39.457
This is a statement.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.059
<i>I'm going straight
for the Anastasia dress</i>

12:41.093 --> 12:42.560
<i>because this is the dress
I've been looking at</i>

12:42.595 --> 12:45.296
for over three months.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.464
- Wow.
- Does that feel okay?

12:46.499 --> 12:50.101
This feels gorgeous.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.936
- It looks incredible on you.
- It does.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.038
I'm just not a fan
of this part right here.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.373
- Not a fan?
- I'm not...

12:55.407 --> 12:56.674
I'm not liking it that much.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.343
[Kelsey] Oh, no.

12:58.377 --> 12:59.878
I'm gonna cry,
because I love ball gowns

12:59.912 --> 13:02.680
and it's not fitting me.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.016
<i>I feel like I'm being swallowed.</i>

13:05.050 --> 13:06.751
<i>It's not fitting in the places</i>

13:06.786 --> 13:08.086
<i>I thought it would fit.</i>

13:08.120 --> 13:09.287
It's really making me question,

13:09.321 --> 13:12.457
if I want a ball gown.

13:12.491 --> 13:16.161
I thought I was gonna cry
when I went in this dress.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.429
You know, I just wanna...
I wanna go show my mom.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.099
[Kelsey] So I'm gonna
just give you Randy, hello.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.234
- Hi. There we go.
- Hi, Randy.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.469
<i>I'm looking at the ceiling.
There we go.</i>

13:24.503 --> 13:25.436
<i>Hi, ladies.</i>

13:27.106 --> 13:30.575
- Viral, viral, viral.
- [woman] Oh, my God.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.444
- Viral.
- That is beautiful.

13:33.479 --> 13:38.316
So this is the Anastasia dress.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.318
- I'll fix the front for you.
- Oh, my God, Amanda.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.654
I know
it has a really long train.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.556
So how do you feel?

13:49.962 --> 13:52.463
I love it, but I don't feel
like that's doing me justice

13:52.498 --> 13:54.499
because it's so big.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.768
<i>It's swimming on you,
definitely.</i>

13:56.802 --> 13:58.269
[woman] Did you see the back
of this dress?

13:58.304 --> 14:00.004
- No, I have this.
- So what we love the most

14:00.039 --> 14:01.739
- about this dress is...
- [Randy] Oh, yeah.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.241
...having the long train.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.076
- Look at that.
- Oh, yes.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.478
The longer, the better,
and the sparkle...

14:07.513 --> 14:10.215
- I'm not really a fan of it.
- Yes. But...

14:10.249 --> 14:11.683
You don't like it, mom?

14:11.717 --> 14:13.484
[Jodie] If we do,
like, a form fitting

14:13.519 --> 14:15.653
with the train in the back
just like that train...

14:15.688 --> 14:17.355
- Okay.
- [Jodie] ...it'll be awesome.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.424
[Randy]<i> I think we need</i>
<i>to maybe try on</i>

14:19.458 --> 14:21.593
<i>some of the slimmer silhouettes.</i>

14:21.627 --> 14:23.361
If you guys are right,
I'm gonna be so, ugh,

14:23.395 --> 14:24.696
I'm not gonna hear
the end of it.

14:24.730 --> 14:28.166
- Should we do it?
- Yes. Perfect.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.835
- Wait.
- Ooh, are you okay?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.872
- [laughter]
- This is huge.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.707
- Because you have the train.
- Wait, wait, wait, I got it.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.175
- Got it?
- Okay.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.710
I think that's, like,
weigh way more than her.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.011
[Amanda] It's so heavy.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.546
Oh, I've stepped
put on Randy's dress.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.015
- [laughs]
- I'm so sorry, Randy.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.683
[upbeat music playing]

14:45.718 --> 14:46.751
This is so pretty.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.120
- It's so pretty.
- I know it.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.324
So like with a few adjustments,

14:53.359 --> 14:55.760
- it's gonna be perfect.
- Yeah.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.528
Oh my gosh.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.897
- Look at the leg.
- Oh, my God.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.199
- [laughter]
- [screams]

15:01.233 --> 15:04.602
- [Jessica] Here she comes.
- [Alexx] Oh, wow.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.205
Hey.

15:07.239 --> 15:11.242
- Guys?
- [Alexx] I like it.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.977
I like it.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.946
[Kindra]
<i>This dress is the vision.</i>

15:14.980 --> 15:17.916
<i>I've always imagined myself
getting married</i>

15:17.950 --> 15:19.450
<i>in a dress like this.</i>

15:19.485 --> 15:21.986
It's a bit timeless
and it's sexy.

15:23.622 --> 15:26.224
Ugh. Okay

15:26.258 --> 15:30.161
You know, it's nothing
I hadn't shown before.

15:30.195 --> 15:33.498
[Marcia] Okay, would you wear
with the split as is?

15:33.532 --> 15:35.033
[Jessica] Uh, I would...
I could clip it here.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.301
- Mmm-hmm.
- Out there.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.635
- [Marcia] Okay.
- So that there's no...

15:37.670 --> 15:39.704
So that it's twerk...
Are you okay?

15:39.738 --> 15:41.906
- I'm okay.
- [laughter]

15:41.941 --> 15:43.274
It has to be twerk approved.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.576
- I can... I can...
- Oh, eh, oh, oh.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.945
- Yeah.
- Does it pass the test?

15:46.979 --> 15:47.946
[Jessica]
It passes the twerk test.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.947
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.315
I brought a clip for you, mom.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.983
We're gonna put it
right over here.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.251
How about a little lower?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.585
[Jessica] Lower, hmm. [laughs]

15:54.620 --> 15:56.154
A little bit...
A little bit more.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.388
- [Jessica] All right.
- [Alexx] Yeah, that's a...

15:57.423 --> 15:58.456
- Right here?
- No.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.124
[laughter]

16:00.159 --> 16:01.693
So in alterations,
you can always close it

16:01.760 --> 16:03.461
just a little bit.

16:03.495 --> 16:06.564
Yeah, just enough
that there's no crotch shot.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.499
[whimsical music playing]

16:08.534 --> 16:10.168
- Phew.
- [laughs]

16:10.202 --> 16:11.135
What an image.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.107
We want the cookies covered.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.175
[Alexx] The cookies
got to be covered.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.676
[Marcia]
Cookies must be covered.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.445
- Close the cookie jar.
- Close the cookie jar.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.146
- Yes, seal it up.
- No... Here we go.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.514
Mmm-hmm.

16:23.549 --> 16:24.849
The plunge is not too much
for you?

16:24.883 --> 16:27.685
- [laughs]
- No.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.987
[Alexx] That's actually
what you wanted.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.722
- Yeah.
- Like, in it, I love a top.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.725
It gives you some zest,
so it's not just plain.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.026
- Yeah.
- You know,

16:35.060 --> 16:37.295
that's what you wanted.
So I like it.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.063
I'm not in love with it,
but I like it.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.099
- Okay.
- I mean, it's you.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.166
- [Kindra] Yeah.
- You know,

16:42.201 --> 16:43.801
- I would like to see...
- Uh-huh.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.849
- ...a little less you.
- [laughter]

16:46.873 --> 16:48.673
That's not... That's not
why we're here.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.608
- Yeah.
- [laughter]

16:50.642 --> 16:52.043
- [Kindra] They have spoken.
- [Jessica] They have spoken.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.344
- Okay.
- [Jessica] So let's head...

16:53.379 --> 16:54.345
let's head back
to the dressing room,

16:54.380 --> 16:57.382
try on another one.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.051
- No.
- [laughter]

17:00.085 --> 17:02.754
- Oh, goodness.
- Okay.

17:02.788 --> 17:07.258
I am definitely nervous
that I am going to have to,

17:07.326 --> 17:09.127
you know,
settle things with my mom,

17:09.161 --> 17:11.462
and get on the same page,
because right now

17:11.497 --> 17:13.431
we are not.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.767
[upbeat music playing]

17:15.801 --> 17:17.068
- Wrapped around the thing.
- Yeah.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.341
All right, to the Belinda we go.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.244
The ball gown was just...
It was such a big gown for me

17:26.278 --> 17:27.779
<i>that it's making me
really question</i>

17:27.813 --> 17:29.280
<i>if I want a ball gown.</i>

17:29.314 --> 17:30.448
Imagine the dress
that looks good on me

17:30.482 --> 17:31.382
is the one my mother-in-law
picked.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.683
[laughs]

17:32.718 --> 17:34.352
So I'm gonna put this
fitted dress on,

17:34.386 --> 17:36.287
to make my mother-in-law
and my mom very happy,

17:36.321 --> 17:40.024
because I know
they wanna see it.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.060
I'm gonna do a bunch of clips.

17:42.094 --> 17:46.230
This isn't even clipped yet
and I actually really...

17:46.265 --> 17:48.366
Girl, did we just transform you

17:48.400 --> 17:50.902
to a fitted dress person?
[laughs]

17:50.936 --> 17:54.705
I love this.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.541
I look so good.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.109
I am so in love with this dress.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.677
[Kelsey] Do you wanna see it
with the overskirt?

17:59.711 --> 18:01.512
- [Amanda] Yes.
- [Kelsey] Okay, cool.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.482
I am very shocked that this
just fits me the way it does.

18:04.516 --> 18:07.785
I was not expecting
to love a fitted dress.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.787
- Oh, my God.
- [chuckles]

18:09.822 --> 18:11.456
[gasps]

18:11.490 --> 18:12.523
<i>I feel like I've been converted</i>

18:12.558 --> 18:14.759
to fitted dresses, yes.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.928
- [Michelle] Here we go.
- [Jodie] Oh, my God.

18:16.962 --> 18:18.796
Surprise.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.364
Hey.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.766
We switched it up.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.167
[Randy] Oh, wow.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.069
That is beautiful.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.572
- I...
- That is beautiful.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.574
I love this dress so much.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.810
I was not expecting
to like this fit.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.846
- [Jodie] I told you.
- [Amanda] This is gorgeous.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.447
- I know. I know.
- [Jodie] She told you.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.182
- [Amanda] I know.
- [Jodie] Listen to mom.

18:38.217 --> 18:41.119
I love how it's a little
bedazzled up here.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.020
I love how it's see-through
right here.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.356
I love the overskirt.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.125
It's me in the back,

18:47.159 --> 18:49.193
and it's my fiance
all in the front.

18:49.228 --> 18:50.795
-[chuckles] -[Amanda]
And whenever I need to,

18:50.829 --> 18:53.731
I just pop this off
and it's party time.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.500
[Jodie] I love it.
I told her it fitted good.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.969
I like it,
but I don't like the train.

18:58.003 --> 19:01.038
- That's the best part.
- It's too plain.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.474
Yeah, if it was longer like
the other one,

19:03.509 --> 19:05.710
and had bling on it
like the other one,

19:05.744 --> 19:08.412
it would be ideal.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.047
How much is this dress?

19:10.082 --> 19:11.849
[Kelsey]
This dress is well in budget.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.317
This one's in the $2,000 range.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.253
[Amanda] Oh, wow. See?

19:15.287 --> 19:17.488
[Randy]<i> So, with that extra</i>
<i>money in alterations,</i>

19:17.523 --> 19:20.224
<i>they could add-on crystals
to the dress</i>

19:20.259 --> 19:21.592
and make it sparkle.

19:21.627 --> 19:22.860
Can I see the back
of the actual dress?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.328
[Kelsey]
The bottom of the dress?

19:24.363 --> 19:25.830
Yeah. Do you wanna see
without the overskirt?

19:25.864 --> 19:27.732
- Yes.
- Okay.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.667
- We'll do a little reveal.
- Are you guys ready?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.337
- There you go.
- [Randy] And voila.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.639
[Kelsey]
And now she's a fitted dress.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.973
[Michelle] Turn around.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.408
[Jodie] Oh, that's so beautiful.

19:37.442 --> 19:38.887
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.545
- Yes.
- I don't even wanna put

19:40.579 --> 19:42.313
the other ball gown on
because I love this one so much.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.481
- Was I... What if I...
- [Jodie] Yes.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.882
Or maybe I should try it on?

19:46.084 --> 19:47.485
What if I don't,
and I regret it?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.986
- [Michelle] What?
- The Belinda thing

19:49.021 --> 19:50.521
is what's it's called, right?

19:50.556 --> 19:52.089
[Kelsey] So this the Belinda
that's the Brussels.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.025
The Brussels, it's more sparkly,

19:54.059 --> 19:56.861
and it's my ball gown,
but it's really sparkly.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.863
[upbeat music playing]

19:58.897 --> 20:00.498
[Michelle] I think
she should try it on.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.899
- [Amanda] You think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.201
Really?

20:04.703 --> 20:05.937
Oh.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.140
- Who invited them?
- [laughter]

20:09.174 --> 20:11.309
Right?

20:11.343 --> 20:13.811
If you don't absolutely
love it better than this,

20:13.845 --> 20:15.213
then don't come out in it.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.881
[Kelsey] Okay, yeah.
Okay, let's do it.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.549
And we'll compare,
and see how we like it

20:18.584 --> 20:20.218
- compared to this fitted one.
- Yes.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.652
[Randy] <i>Okay, good luck, Amanda.</i>

20:21.687 --> 20:23.020
Thank you.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.056
I am very confused
because I really thought

20:25.090 --> 20:26.824
<i>everyone was gonna love
this dress.</i>

20:26.858 --> 20:28.359
<i>But my mother-in-law
wasn't crying,</i>

20:28.393 --> 20:30.027
my mom wasn't really crying.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.496
So the next ball gown
is the Brussels dress.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.300
This one's a little bit
higher, this one's $4,980.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.136
<i>So this second ball gown, I'm
honestly a little nervous,</i>

20:39.171 --> 20:40.638
<i>because of how
the first one went,</i>

20:40.672 --> 20:43.040
but I'm willing to try because
at this point,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.408
I don't know what to do.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.047
Let me see.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.482
Okay.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.150
I'm so confused.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.187
[tense music playing]

20:59.291 --> 21:01.759
[upbeat music playing]

21:06.698 --> 21:09.133
- All righty. Come on in.
- All righty.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.969
Well, that was not quite
the wow response...

21:12.004 --> 21:14.972
- Reaction? Okay.
- ...that I was hoping for.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.375
- Okay.
- They didn't seem to get it.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.243
We'll try on some others
and then we can always

21:19.278 --> 21:21.078
put it back on.
If you're still loving it,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.180
then really showing them
that you love it...

21:23.215 --> 21:24.715
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...is a good start.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.684
- Okay.
- So I plan to put Kindra

21:26.718 --> 21:29.587
in the Tony Ward next because
it's, you know, full detail,

21:29.621 --> 21:31.689
it has that really wow factor.
And it's completely

21:31.723 --> 21:33.658
<i>different from the first
one, you know,</i>

21:33.692 --> 21:35.993
<i>it has a different neckline,
and different detail aspects.</i>

21:36.028 --> 21:38.562
So, I'm very excited
to see her reaction.

21:40.265 --> 21:43.634
- Cool. Oh.
- Hey, what are we thinking?

21:43.669 --> 21:45.636
Yeah, I'm liking this.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.372
- [Jessica] Okay.
- I love the shape of it.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.374
- Okay.
- I love like what it's doing here.

21:50.409 --> 21:52.343
- Okay.
- I'm loving this dress.

21:52.377 --> 21:53.978
Okay. Let's go show them.

21:54.012 --> 21:56.147
<i>But the midsection is
see-through,</i>

21:56.181 --> 21:59.417
and I think that my mom is
gonna have a hard time with that.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.985
- Oh.
- We are ready for the bride.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.286
We are ready for the bride.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.654
We've been ready for the bride.

22:03.689 --> 22:04.922
Okay.

22:07.926 --> 22:11.629
- [Jessica] What do we think?
- [laughter]

22:11.663 --> 22:13.564
[Alexx] I love the top.
Look at her. [chuckles]

22:13.598 --> 22:14.932
She's like... She's scared.

22:14.966 --> 22:17.768
[Jessica] Waiting on
a response from mom.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.103
[Marcia] Oh...

22:21.073 --> 22:24.809
that is a lot up top.
We can see you.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.944
Oh, goodness, you're worried
about the sheerness.

22:26.978 --> 22:29.447
[Marcia] That's what
I'm looking at, the sheerness.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.115
- [Kindra] It can be line.
- [Jessica] It can be line.

22:31.149 --> 22:32.416
[Kindra] Everything...
Where was it?

22:32.451 --> 22:33.617
Everything that you see
can be lined.

22:33.652 --> 22:34.919
Everything that... Here we go.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.555
Everything that you see
can be lined.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.156
Everything that we see
can be line.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.591
- Say it with me.
- But will you line it?

22:40.625 --> 22:43.561
[tense music playing]

22:43.595 --> 22:47.565
[Kindra] I mean, I don't think
it really needs to be lined.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.867
- [Marcia] Okay.
- But if it'll make mom

22:49.901 --> 22:51.202
super happy, I would be willing

22:51.236 --> 22:52.436
to compromise with you
and line it.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.438
Oh. Okay.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.540
- That's a compromise.
- I don't think that's gonna

22:56.575 --> 22:58.943
- cross the seamstress' desk.
- That's the compromise...

22:58.977 --> 23:01.212
- [Marcia] Line this dress.
- [Alexx] Right. It wasn't

23:01.246 --> 23:03.013
- too revealing though.
- [Marcia] I know my daughter.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.682
- Nothing that we need to...
- [Marcia] We disagree.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.150
- We totally disagree.
- ...turn our heads to.

23:06.184 --> 23:07.351
- We do.
- We do?

23:07.386 --> 23:08.452
- We do. I love the top.
- I look...

23:08.487 --> 23:09.854
I don't like top, no.

23:09.888 --> 23:10.955
[Marcia] Okay. All right.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.623
Okay, can we move beyond that?

23:12.657 --> 23:14.191
I love the boning.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.560
I feel a little ice princessy.

23:16.595 --> 23:17.995
Yeah, it's a little bit much
for you.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.663
[Kindra]
The sparkle is a little lot.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.165
- [Marcia] That's not you.
- [Alexx] That's not...

23:21.233 --> 23:22.833
- That's...
- [Kindra] Oh, you all agree?

23:22.868 --> 23:24.001
[Alexx] And we're on
the same page, aren't we?

23:24.035 --> 23:25.703
I thought that you all
were gonna be for the sparkle.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.204
- It's too much sparkle.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.372
- That's not you.
- Okay, so we agree.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.507
I... I'm for this year.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.775
[Jessica] Onto the next, right?

23:30.809 --> 23:32.610
- [Marcia] Onto the next.
- But in my head,

23:32.644 --> 23:35.012
I keep comparing this dress
to dress number one,

23:35.046 --> 23:38.783
and it's just not competing.
So I know it's a no.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.951
This one has the lower
waistline, so I'm interested

23:40.986 --> 23:43.521
- to see how you feel about that. Look.
- [Kindra] Let's try that one.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.456
- [Jessica] You wanna try this one, next?
- [Kindra] Yeah.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.525
- [Jessica] Okay.
- See, like this one has the magical at the top.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.959
[Alexx] I think this is pretty.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.694
[Marcia] I think
this is really pretty, too.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.062
- I think she should try this on.
- Right?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.831
Hopefully we can meet
in the middle.

23:53.865 --> 23:56.033
Give her a little bit what
she wants,

23:56.067 --> 23:58.135
I get a little bit what I want,

23:58.170 --> 24:00.604
and, uh, we can be happy.

24:00.639 --> 24:03.040
Kindra.

24:03.074 --> 24:04.875
[Kindra] Mom.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.444
- Okay. All right.
- [Jessica] How do feel so far

24:06.478 --> 24:08.446
- on this one?
- I'm liking the top a lot.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.548
[Jessica] Okay. It's a little
bit more princessy.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.383
- How do you feel like a princess?
- It's very princessy.

24:12.417 --> 24:15.019
I don't...
I don't think it's the one.

24:15.053 --> 24:17.354
- [knock on door]
- Hello.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.622
- [Jessica] Hello.
- Hey.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.858
Oh, mom found a dress.
Let me see.

24:20.892 --> 24:23.694
- Oh, what, whoa.
- What you think about this?

24:23.728 --> 24:24.962
- [Jessica] Okay, Mom.
- [Kindra] Okay.

24:24.996 --> 24:27.531
- Oh, look at you.
- I like it.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.733
I'm thinking this gives you...
It's like a compromise, right?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.335
[Kindra] That's cool.
That's really cool.

24:31.369 --> 24:32.736
[Jessica] That's
her favorite word today.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.238
[Marcia] Yeah.
Okay, yeah, compromise.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.340
- There's no split.
- [Kindra] That's okay.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.108
-Okay. Okay.
-[Kindra] I'll try... I'll try it. I'll try it.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.777
- Awesome.
- Okay, I can put this right in.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.278
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.214
- [Kindra] Thanks, Mom.
- [Jessica] All right.

24:43.248 --> 24:45.049
- She nailing it.
- Okay.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.884
-She liked it. She liked it
-Oh, she likes this one?

24:46.918 --> 24:48.285
[Marcia]
The one we just picked out.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.620
- [Alexx] Oh, she did?
- Yeah, even though

24:49.654 --> 24:51.055
it didn't have a split.

24:51.089 --> 24:55.059
Oh, wow, Mom?

24:55.093 --> 24:56.894
[Jessica] Yeah, you like it?

24:56.928 --> 24:58.896
Wow.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.965
- Dude.
- [Jessica] Okay, Mom.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.933
[Kindra]
<i>This dress is super unique.</i>

25:02.968 --> 25:05.336
I love that
I have never seen a bride

25:05.370 --> 25:06.670
in a dress like this before.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.672
So, I like the uniqueness of it.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.941
- I can't wait to see this one.
- They'll see. Look at here.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.644
- [Alexx] Oh, look...
- [laughs] Oh, my gosh.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.480
[upbeat music playing]

25:16.515 --> 25:18.115
You did good, Mom.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.661
You have a train,
you have the plunge,

25:30.695 --> 25:32.930
you have the detail.

25:32.964 --> 25:35.633
I love the, um,
I love the plunge,

25:35.667 --> 25:38.068
I love the neckline, I love...
This is super unique.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.070
- [Marcia] I do. Thank you.
- [Alexx] The details.

25:40.105 --> 25:43.641
[Kindra] It's detail without
being full of, um, sparkles

25:43.675 --> 25:45.309
and everything like that, so...

25:45.343 --> 25:47.912
I think it have a little bit
of what she likes

25:47.946 --> 25:50.781
regarding the top,
the bust line, and the plunge.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.182
So it's...
But it's not too much.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.484
- [Kindra] Right.
- [Alexx] Absolutely.

25:53.518 --> 25:54.818
[Marcia] You know,
so I have to...

25:54.853 --> 25:56.820
-[Alexx] It's very tasteful, yeah.
-[Marcia] It's very tasteful.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.023
If I had to choose
between the two, as...

25:59.057 --> 26:01.492
I think I... The other one
is weighing just a tad for me.

26:01.526 --> 26:03.661
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Why?

26:03.695 --> 26:05.663
- Because of the split.
- Because of the split.

26:05.697 --> 26:07.698
- There we go.
- But the split is a nice wow factor.

26:07.732 --> 26:08.999
It is, yeah, it is.

26:09.034 --> 26:11.001
So what's the price tag
on this one?

26:11.036 --> 26:13.404
- This one is $6,810.
- [Marcia] Okay, okay.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.472
The first one's a little bit
different.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.342
Okay, what's the price tag
on the first one?

26:18.376 --> 26:20.744
- So $3,400.
- Hoo, I love it.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.079
- [Jessica] You love it?
- Yes, I love it.

26:22.113 --> 26:23.714
So now we love a split.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.215
That's an amazing dress.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.084
Okay, so the first one
is number one for Mom.

26:27.118 --> 26:28.919
- It's an amazing dress.
- [laughter]

26:28.954 --> 26:31.255
- We gonna be okay.
- [Jessica] Yup, absolutely.

26:31.289 --> 26:33.057
- [Marcia] Come down the aisle.
- Yeah, the congregation

26:33.091 --> 26:34.592
- is like come out down.
- [Marcia] We'll be fine.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.226
- Them first.
- [laughter]

26:36.261 --> 26:37.895
So now I'm actually getting
a little bit nervous,

26:37.929 --> 26:39.697
<i>because I have all
of these options,</i>

26:39.731 --> 26:44.335
<i>but nothing has really wowed
me enough yet to say yes.</i>

26:44.369 --> 26:47.738
- [Marcia] So what's next?
- So there is one more,

26:47.772 --> 26:50.674
like, uh, detailed bustier
top with the off the shoulder

26:50.709 --> 26:52.042
sleeves I definitely wanna try.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.477
[Marcia] I wanna see... Okay.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.245
<i>I had to kiss a couple of frogs</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:56.847
before I found my prince,
so of course I'm gonna need

26:56.881 --> 26:59.383
to try on a couple of dresses
before I find the one.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.952
- That was music to your ears.
- Oh, yeah.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.621
- You were ready to twerk, huh?
- I was like...

27:03.655 --> 27:05.623
[laughter]

27:05.657 --> 27:07.625
[upbeat music playing]

27:07.659 --> 27:09.293
[Kelsey] All right.
So the next ball gown

27:09.327 --> 27:11.895
- is the Brussels dress.
- So she didn't like

27:11.930 --> 27:15.833
the Anastasia,
she loves the Belinda.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.570
And she's gonna try
on the Brussels,

27:19.604 --> 27:21.605
but if she doesn't like it, she's
gonna go back to the Belinda.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.641
I think it's gonna be
the Belinda.

27:24.909 --> 27:26.977
I really like this too.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.813
Look at the detail right here.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.315
Oh, my God, maybe I shouldn't
have put this on.

27:31.349 --> 27:32.883
Now, I don't know
what I wanna do.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.551
[Kelsey] [laughs]
So we just confused it?

27:34.586 --> 27:36.086
It is a drop waist.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.489
The exact kind of ball gown
I was looking for.

27:38.523 --> 27:42.226
<i>It has a beautiful heart
on the front of the dress</i>

27:42.260 --> 27:44.428
and it's sparkly to the max.

27:44.462 --> 27:46.630
- Buttons up the back.
- Oh.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.998
That is amazing.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.299
And then you have
the long train.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.869
[screams]
Look at the back. [gasps]

27:51.903 --> 27:53.470
I love this too.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.774
I'm so confused.
Oh, my goodness.

27:56.808 --> 28:00.044
I love the fitted dress
with the overskirt,

28:00.078 --> 28:03.113
but now, I'm just like,
"Overskirt what?"

28:03.148 --> 28:06.150
[dramatic music playing]

28:07.752 --> 28:10.554
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

28:10.588 --> 28:13.691
I know. I'm so torn.
I love it so much.

28:13.725 --> 28:16.727
[dramatic music playing]

28:22.534 --> 28:25.502
- [Jodie] I love that.
- I love this so much.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.505
Because it's tight on top
and then it flows like...

28:28.540 --> 28:30.340
- Oh, wow. I know.
- It's so beautiful.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.608
I know.

28:31.643 --> 28:34.011
<i>My mom's face drops.</i>

28:34.045 --> 28:36.013
<i>My mother-in-law's face drops.</i>

28:36.047 --> 28:39.817
And I'm, like, yes. [chuckles]

28:39.851 --> 28:41.819
[laughs] The top of this
dress is everything.

28:41.853 --> 28:44.221
I love how it goes up
the neck right here.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.190
- I love this.
- [Michelle] And if it's gonna be low like that,

28:46.224 --> 28:47.791
it still shows your smallness.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.026
[Amanda] Yeah. Okay.
You guys have to see

28:49.060 --> 28:50.461
the back of this dress.

28:50.495 --> 28:53.197
So, if you want to spin
this way.

28:53.231 --> 28:56.934
This would hook up
in the back here,

28:56.968 --> 29:00.437
but you're still gonna get
all this lace down the center.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.172
-[Jodie] Yes.
-[Michelle] Oh, that's beautiful.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.407
So you don't lose the detail.

29:03.441 --> 29:04.908
[Randy]
You said you wanted extra.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.744
This is definitely extra.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.245
I think that's the dress.

29:08.279 --> 29:09.513
I'm so happy.
I went back to ball gown.

29:09.547 --> 29:12.916
- I told you I was right.
- [laughter]

29:12.951 --> 29:14.418
I wanna try a veil on
with this dress.

29:14.452 --> 29:16.253
- Do wanna see a veil?
- Yes.

29:16.287 --> 29:18.522
I knew as soon
as she was walking out,

29:18.556 --> 29:19.857
that was the dress.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.258
[Jodie]
It's good to see her happy.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.559
- Yes.
- Yes.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.962
You can spin this way.

29:24.996 --> 29:29.733
Oh, oh, my goodness. [giggles]

29:29.768 --> 29:31.368
This is my dress.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.872
Oh.

29:34.906 --> 29:38.075
- It's gorgeous.
- [Amanda] I love it so much.

29:38.109 --> 29:41.078
Oh, my God. Raymond is gonna
love me in this dress.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.713
<i>I know he wants me
in a fitted dress,</i>

29:42.747 --> 29:44.915
but I think the minute
he sees me in this dress

29:44.949 --> 29:47.050
he's gonna fall in love
with me all over again.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.220
- This is everything.
- [Michelle] That's so pretty.

29:50.255 --> 29:52.222
[Amanda] I knew it,
ball gown, ball gown.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.891
[laughter]

29:53.925 --> 29:57.761
Well, Randy, do we need
to ask Amanda a big question?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.930
I'm so ready.
Ask me the question already.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.565
[laughter]

30:01.633 --> 30:05.636
[both] Amanda, are you saying
yes to the dress?

30:08.940 --> 30:11.341
I'm saying yes
to my Randy Fenoli dress.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.377
[cheers and applause]

30:16.915 --> 30:18.448
- I'm so excited.
- Congratulations.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.250
- I love it.
- [Amanda] Thank you so much.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.252
I'm so excited. Oh, my God.

30:22.287 --> 30:24.888
My fiance is gonna think
I look so gorgeous.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.124
- Viral all the way, baby.
- [Kelsey] Viral all the way.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.126
Go viral all the way.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.261
- Whoo.
- Viral all the way.

30:31.296 --> 30:34.298
[upbeat music playing]

30:37.035 --> 30:39.036
Where is your belt?

30:39.070 --> 30:42.072
[Kelsey T] There's a belt.
Yeah. There's a belt.

30:42.106 --> 30:45.342
We're missing the belt,
which is a little alarming.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.010
It's absolutely beautiful.
Of course, you know,

30:47.045 --> 30:49.479
- I'm looking at the...
- The sheerness.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.484
[indistinct chatter]

31:01.125 --> 31:04.528
I'm here today to have my
second fitting for my dress.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.396
- [Carleen] Here you go.
- Hi. Good to see you again.

31:06.431 --> 31:07.931
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

31:07.966 --> 31:09.499
This is my future
mother-in-law, Carleen.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.368
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.
- [Evangelista] Oh, hi.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.570
- Nice to meet you too.
- And this is my big brother, Scotty.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.373
My big brother helped me
pick out my wedding dress.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.009
He came in.
I was gonna go by myself.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.345
<i>It was, you know,
during the pandemic,</i>

31:21.379 --> 31:24.214
<i>so it wasn't easy
for anybody to travel in.</i>

31:24.249 --> 31:25.782
[Evangelista]
So, you can have a seat.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.417
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.553
Every boutique that
we went to, everybody's, like,

31:29.587 --> 31:31.188
- giving me the side eye.
- [laughs]

31:31.222 --> 31:34.024
Like, wondering what this
big oafish young man

31:34.058 --> 31:36.260
is doing in the building,
but that's my job.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.295
That's my job
as the big brother.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.197
- You picked the dress.
- I helped her pick the dress.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.399
[Carleen] Yes.
And then I came second.

31:42.433 --> 31:44.268
Mmm-hmm.
This is a momentous moment.

31:44.302 --> 31:48.171
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is... Yeah.

31:48.206 --> 31:50.741
[Kelsey T] I can't believe
it's finally here.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.943
[Evangelista] Yes. So, this
is your beautiful dress.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.712
It's beautiful. [chuckles]
I'm really excited to get it on.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.547
- Oh, let's try. [laughs]
- [Kelsey T] I wanna see it.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.249
- Horrible.
- My son is very lucky.

31:59.284 --> 32:02.419
<i>They went to same college
together. And...</i>

32:02.453 --> 32:04.521
[Scott]<i> What did you just</i>
<i>say just a little earlier,</i>

32:04.555 --> 32:06.123
<i>they have to be friends
first, right?</i>

32:06.157 --> 32:08.825
They have to be friends
first before anything else.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.528
My fiance is Gino Papa.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.830
<i>Gino and I met
our first week of college</i>

32:13.865 --> 32:16.233
<i>and we were friends
for many, many years.</i>

32:16.267 --> 32:18.302
<i>I was hesitant
to date one of my friends,</i>

32:18.336 --> 32:21.405
<i>but I think that we've been
in love for a long time.</i>

32:21.439 --> 32:23.573
<i>So, it was a very easy
transition.</i>

32:23.608 --> 32:26.109
<i>My wedding is going to be
out on the water.</i>

32:26.144 --> 32:30.948
<i>It's gonna be a beautiful
brunch seafood type affair.</i>

32:30.982 --> 32:33.817
<i>And my brother is marrying us
because we knew</i>

32:33.851 --> 32:36.086
<i>that we wanted him to have
an important place</i>

32:36.120 --> 32:38.155
in our wedding,
so I'm very excited.

32:38.189 --> 32:40.157
Took out a lot of the crinoline.

32:40.191 --> 32:41.992
- [Evangelista] Yes.
- Did they put it back?

32:42.026 --> 32:46.863
I am nervous today
because I did have it

32:46.898 --> 32:50.767
altered slightly,
so it fit my style more.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.636
[Evangelista]
It looks beautiful, sweetie.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.771
Yeah. I can't wait to see it
with the belt.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.640
- [Evangelista speaking]
- [Kelsey T] A belt and a veil.

32:56.674 --> 32:59.676
- Yeah.
- [Evangelista speaking]

33:02.213 --> 33:04.581
I'm waiting.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.416
- Yeah, here's one for you.
- Yeah.

33:06.451 --> 33:07.684
Okay.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.389
- [Evangelista] You can go.
- Oh, my goodness.

33:12.423 --> 33:13.824
[Evangelista] Okay.
So you can come first.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.759
Oh, so beautiful, Kelsey.

33:15.793 --> 33:18.862
-Yeah, I love it.
-[Evangelista] It's gonna come down.

33:18.896 --> 33:20.897
[laughter]

33:23.935 --> 33:26.636
[Evangelista] Just fit it.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.171
- [Carleen] Oh, there it is.
- Got you.

33:28.206 --> 33:30.140
[Carleen] Perfect.

33:30.174 --> 33:35.212
It's beautiful, Kelsey.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.814
- [Carleen speaking]
- There is a belt.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.050
[Carleen]
Oh, the belt isn't attached?

33:40.084 --> 33:42.419
-We bought it.
-[Kelsey T] Yeah. There's a belt.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.454
[Evangelista speaking]

33:46.257 --> 33:47.424
Okay.

33:47.458 --> 33:50.427
[tense music playing]

33:50.461 --> 33:53.663
We're missing the belt,
which is a little alarming.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.066
[Evangelista] Did you see
the belt? The belt?

33:56.100 --> 33:57.868
Um, what?

33:57.902 --> 34:02.105
It's definitely been part
of the vision all along.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.207
<i>So, to not have it now
and especially</i>

34:04.275 --> 34:05.909
<i>when we're this close
to the wedding</i>

34:05.943 --> 34:08.211
<i>and there may not be time
to get another one,</i>

34:08.246 --> 34:12.249
I just have a little
pitter-patter in my heart.

34:12.283 --> 34:13.650
[Evangelista speaking]

34:17.755 --> 34:18.955
Uh-oh.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.725
That's not good.

34:21.759 --> 34:24.694
[upbeat music playing]

34:24.762 --> 34:26.830
The first dress is still
the best one so far.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.632
<i>It's still number one.
If I had to, like,</i>

34:28.666 --> 34:30.400
<i>leave right now
and choose a dress,</i>

34:30.435 --> 34:32.702
<i>that'll be the one I left with.</i>

34:32.737 --> 34:34.871
But at the same time, like,
I want the people

34:34.906 --> 34:36.406
that I love to also love
the dress.

34:36.441 --> 34:38.308
<i>We're coming down to the wire.</i>

34:38.342 --> 34:41.912
I have one more dress to try
on and I'm a little nervous

34:41.946 --> 34:43.880
<i>because on the hanger,
it's not really giving me</i>

34:43.915 --> 34:46.883
everything I want,
but we'll see.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.885
Wow. Wow.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.721
- Yeah.
- This is really good. Wow.

34:51.756 --> 34:55.292
I think that this one really
matches my personality.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.727
So this one, I really feel
like I get to show off

34:57.762 --> 35:00.297
my style a little bit,
but I also get a little bit

35:00.331 --> 35:03.767
of that classicness in a skirt.

35:03.801 --> 35:05.769
- [Marcia] Oh, that's sweet.
- [Alexx] Oh.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.437
Oh, my gosh. That...
I love that.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.339
This is one of the originals
that we had fit.

35:09.373 --> 35:12.776
- [Marcia] Wow, Kindra.
- What are we thinking?

35:12.810 --> 35:14.778
-[Marcia] Wow. I like that one a lot.
-This is beautiful.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.780
I know. That's...
Honestly, that's a...

35:16.814 --> 35:18.615
- That's top for me.
- This is good.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.150
- That's top for you?
- Yeah. I love it.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.284
- Oh.
- I love it.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.519
This is what I envisioned.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.221
This is sort of
what I envisioned too

35:24.255 --> 35:26.189
-and I love the corset. I love the top.
-[Alexx] Okay.

35:26.224 --> 35:28.492
[Kindra] I love that
the flowers come down,

35:28.526 --> 35:30.660
but not too much.
Even the little pearl

35:30.695 --> 35:32.662
- details in here is beautiful.
- [Jessica] Yeah.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.064
[Kindra] The sleeves are great.

35:34.098 --> 35:35.365
[Jessica]
The sleeves are beautiful.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.601
Love the sleeves.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.436
And I love
that the skirt is full,

35:39.470 --> 35:41.838
but not quite as princessy
as I've been wearing...

35:41.873 --> 35:43.440
- [Alexx] Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- [Jessica] Mmm-hmm.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.275
...which I really like.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.777
You look amazing in this dress.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.113
It's beautiful.
It's absolutely beautiful.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.115
Of course, you know,
I'm looking at the,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.451
- you know... [laughs]
- [Alexx] The sheerness?

35:54.485 --> 35:55.852
[Kindra] The sheerness here.

36:00.892 --> 36:04.327
[upbeat music playing]

36:04.362 --> 36:07.130
[Alexx] You look amazing
in this dress.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.399
It's beautiful.
It's absolutely beautiful.

36:09.433 --> 36:11.434
Of course, you know,
I'm looking at the,

36:11.469 --> 36:13.603
- you know... [laughs]
- [Alexx] The sheerness?

36:13.638 --> 36:16.306
[Kindra] The sheerness here.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.341
But it's tasteful.
It's tasteful.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.477
- It's tasteful. It's taste...
- [Kindra] Okay.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.313
It's absolutely beautiful.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.814
So, what's your favorite?

36:26.484 --> 36:28.518
I would love to see this
with some type of headpiece,

36:28.553 --> 36:30.353
what have you,
that's gonna seal it for me.

36:30.388 --> 36:32.522
- I mean, a veil or something.
- Yeah.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.925
This dress, it gave me a
feeling that the other dresses

36:34.959 --> 36:37.260
didn't really give me.
Everything else I put on,

36:37.295 --> 36:38.828
I felt like a spectator a bit.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.632
Like, "Oh, this is pretty.
This is pretty." Ooh.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.634
But when I put this
final dress on,

36:44.669 --> 36:47.237
I'm feeling like this could
really be my wedding dress.

36:47.271 --> 36:50.106
- [Marcia] I love the hair.
- I'm kinda starting to feel the... Oh, wow.

36:50.141 --> 36:53.143
- [Marcia] Oh, it's happening.
- I'm kinda starting to feel the vibe here.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.078
This is beautiful, Kindra.
This is the way

36:55.112 --> 36:59.316
I envisioned you as a little
girl one day seeing you.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.318
[Kindra] Oh, God,
now you're gonna make me cry.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.553
[Marcia] Yeah,
seeing you getting married.

37:03.588 --> 37:06.823
- You are beautiful.
- [Jessica] Aw.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.225
[Kindra] Aw, thank you, Mom.

37:08.259 --> 37:09.993
Oh, mom, I can't. [laughs]

37:10.027 --> 37:12.829
- [Marcia] You're so beautiful.
- Oh.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.998
[Alexx] Yeah. When I saw
your eyes start to well up,

37:15.032 --> 37:16.533
- I was like...
- Oh, my God. Was it obvious?

37:16.567 --> 37:18.702
...this is it. Yes.
It was very obvious.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.003
[laughs]

37:20.037 --> 37:22.005
So before we have you
turn around.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.841
- Mmm-hmm.
- It has to pass the test.

37:24.875 --> 37:26.243
Can I twerk? [laughs]

37:26.277 --> 37:27.877
[Jessica] Can you twerk in it?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.179
- [Kindra] Let's see.
- Can you party in it?

37:29.213 --> 37:30.680
If I can twerk.
It is twerk-approved.

37:30.715 --> 37:32.549
- It's twerk-approved.
- [laughter]

37:32.583 --> 37:35.018
[Jessica] Yes,
it's twerk-approved.

37:35.052 --> 37:38.021
At one point, I genuinely
thought that dress number one

37:38.055 --> 37:39.556
was going to be it.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.558
<i>I was like,
"This is the dress to be."</i>

37:41.592 --> 37:43.393
- Wow.
- Look at you.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.995
Yeah. Wow.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.564
But once I saw it with the veil,

37:47.598 --> 37:49.633
that just really took
it over the edge for me

37:49.667 --> 37:51.468
and then it was like, yes,

37:51.502 --> 37:53.069
a slit does not
compete with this.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.971
It feels great. It feels right.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.540
<i>That one just felt, like,
it was made for me.</i>

37:57.575 --> 37:59.542
<i>I think that Jamel
is really gonna love it.</i>

37:59.577 --> 38:01.745
Can you see yourself
walking down the aisle

38:01.779 --> 38:03.580
- to your fiance in this dress?
- Yes.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.215
- Yes?
- Yes.

38:05.249 --> 38:07.984
Kindra, are we gonna say yes
to the dress?

38:13.758 --> 38:15.558
We are gonna say yes
to the dress.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.594
[cheers and applause]

38:18.262 --> 38:20.297
Congratulations.

38:20.331 --> 38:21.931
- Awesome.
- Oh, my God.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.400
I had to drop it, but I
was like, "I had no idea

38:23.434 --> 38:25.802
what to drop it on, you know.

38:25.836 --> 38:27.237
Oh, Mom.

38:27.271 --> 38:30.240
Oh, my goodness,
this is too real right now.

38:30.274 --> 38:32.242
You all get ready.
I told Pastor Mary,

38:32.276 --> 38:33.910
I said, "We're gonna
be having dance."

38:33.944 --> 38:35.879
<i>And then she said, "Okay.
I can electric slide."</i>

38:35.913 --> 38:37.147
<i>I was like, "Oh, no, honey.</i>

38:37.181 --> 38:39.616
As the night gets lower,
so do I."

38:39.650 --> 38:41.751
[laughter]

38:41.786 --> 38:44.754
[Alexx] Hey, my girl getting
married. Getting married.

38:44.789 --> 38:47.791
[dramatic music playing]

38:51.862 --> 38:54.864
- [upbeat music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

38:59.236 --> 39:01.271
[Carleen] They'll find it.

39:01.305 --> 39:03.340
- I hope so.
- [Carleen] Positive vibes.

39:03.374 --> 39:07.310
I hope they find it
before May 29th.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.281
- [woman speaking]
- [Evangelista speaking]

39:11.315 --> 39:12.782
- I'm nervous.
- We need...

39:12.817 --> 39:15.352
We need the complete picture

39:15.386 --> 39:18.154
- [woman speaking]
- [woman speaking]

39:18.189 --> 39:19.823
[woman speaking]

39:19.857 --> 39:21.624
[Evangelista speaking]

39:21.659 --> 39:25.128
[woman speaking]

39:25.162 --> 39:27.197
Oh, my gosh.
This is taking a.while.

39:27.231 --> 39:28.998
- You get nervous?
- I saw it.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.300
I saw it the last time
I was here.

39:30.334 --> 39:32.001
[Scott] Yeah.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.870
So, it's probably
just misplaced.

39:33.904 --> 39:35.004
[woman speaking]

39:37.842 --> 39:40.677
[exhales deeply]

39:40.711 --> 39:42.679
- Yeah. We found the belt.
- Wow.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.314
- Thank goodness.
- Perfect.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.649
- We got the belt.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.184
- Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.
- Is this the belt?

39:48.219 --> 39:49.219
Exactly, yes.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.154
- Uh, yeah.
- [laughter]

39:51.188 --> 39:53.823
- [Carleen] Yes.
- Was getting a little anxious there, so...

39:53.858 --> 39:56.326
[Scott] The belt makes it.
The belt completes the look.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.628
And it's...
And it's absolutely necessary.

39:58.662 --> 40:01.631
And now that we can see that,
it's perfect.

40:01.665 --> 40:04.434
[Carleen] My son
is gonna be floored, yeah.

40:04.468 --> 40:07.036
He's gonna be floored seeing
her walk down that aisle.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.671
- Oh.
- [Evangelista] Come, come,

40:08.706 --> 40:10.774
- stay straight, yes.
- [Kelsey T] Okay. [gasps]

40:10.808 --> 40:14.377
Wow. Yeah. This is perfect.
I love that you took it in...

40:14.412 --> 40:15.879
- [Evangelista] Yeah.
- ...just a little bit.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.647
[Evangelista]
Oh, my goodness, yeah.

40:17.681 --> 40:19.849
It's just what I wanted.
I think that this is exactly

40:19.884 --> 40:22.685
what vision I had in my head.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.121
So, it's really perfect to me.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.656
- [Scott] Yeah?
- We did a good job together.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.224
- Did I? Really?
- Look at us.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.226
- We did a good job.
- Hey, we're a winning team.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.262
[applause]

[dramatic music playing]

40:40.538 --> 40:43.339
[Kelsey T]<i> I'm absolutely</i>
<i>excited for Gino</i>

40:43.374 --> 40:45.442
<i>to see me in my dress.</i>

40:45.476 --> 40:50.513
<i>I think that he's just going
to absolutely love the look.</i>

40:50.548 --> 40:52.348
[Gino]<i> Kelsey is one of</i>
<i>my first friends in college</i>

40:52.383 --> 40:55.518
and I've always loved
being her friend.

40:55.553 --> 40:58.521
And it's... It felt like we
always had something special

40:58.556 --> 41:00.690
and it's coming to fruition now.

41:00.724 --> 41:03.726

41:06.464 --> 41:08.264
- [cheering and applauding]

41:12.736 --> 41:14.671
- [Gino] Mmm-hmm.
- [Kelsey T]<i> Nevertheless,</i>

41:14.705 --> 41:19.509
<i>I still ask myself all
the time how it took so long</i>

41:19.543 --> 41:21.377
<i>for us to figure this out.</i>

41:21.412 --> 41:24.380
But the truth
is so much simpler,

41:24.415 --> 41:28.184
we are friends,
we're best friends.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.019
We've been smiling
and laughing together

41:30.054 --> 41:32.522
all this time
and we've already made

41:32.556 --> 41:35.058
a lifetime of beautiful
memories together.

41:35.092 --> 41:38.061
I'm so excited
for the rest of our lives.

41:38.095 --> 41:40.463
Keep building more. I love you.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.866
I always have. I always will.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.902
- [woman] Oh, God.
- [cheers and applause]

41:48.438 --> 41:51.174
Will you love him and have
faith in his love for you?

41:51.208 --> 41:52.876
I will.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.946
Do you take Kelsey as she is,
loving who she is now,

41:56.981 --> 41:59.883
- and who she is yet to become?
- I will.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.185
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

42:02.219 --> 42:03.653
Gino, you may kiss the bride.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.689
- Oh, I will.
- [cheers and applause]

42:09.493 --> 42:12.495
[upbeat music playing]

42:14.164 --> 42:15.999
[Gino]<i> Kelsey looks</i>
<i>so beautiful in her dress.</i>

42:16.033 --> 42:19.502
I did not expect to be
surprised knowing somebody

42:19.537 --> 42:22.472
<i>and seeing somebody
for 11 years.</i>

42:22.506 --> 42:24.173
<i>- Yeah, beautiful.</i>
- [Kelsey T]<i> Mmm-hmm.</i>

42:24.208 --> 42:25.808
<i>- I love you.</i>
- [Gino]<i> I love you, too.</i>
