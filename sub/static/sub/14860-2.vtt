Hey, guys.
ALL: Hi.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.711
You remember my
super racist parrot Tyler.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.246
Hi, Tyler!
What's up?

00:07.549 --> 00:08.664
Best entrance ever, girl.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.878
| realized that Tyler
was just racist

00:11.178 --> 00:13.010
"cause he didn't have any
other interests other than racism.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.296
So I got him into baseball.
(SQUAWKS) | hate the Indians.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.181

Cubs fans, | say not cool, bird.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.895
(SQUAWKS)

00:24.191 --> 00:26.228
Now why would you bring
your bird into a diner?

00:26.527 --> 00:27.483
Wait. I don't know
why I'm surprised.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.065
| once saw you put
sunscreen on a grape

00:30.364 --> 00:31.445
'cause you didn't want it
to become a raisin.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.901
I'm taking Tyler home
from my store

00:33.200 --> 00:36.238
because I'm going
to the Rom-Com Con.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.948

am gonna be rubbing elbows

00:38.247 --> 00:40.614

Ooh! On Saturday,

It's gonna be awesome,
all right?

00:49.675 --> 00:50.790
Are you sure you
don't want to go, Brad?

00:51.093 --> 00:51.673
(SINGSONGY)
It's in Detroit.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.210
Ooh! Detroit!

00:54.513 --> 00:57.301
Sorry. Money's tight. Had
to cut back on all my cons.

conventions for stuff I like,

Oh, how about a con
for the drunk guy

Oh! What about a con for
the guy that's about to get

with that drunk guy?

on con like Donkey Kong con."

01:23.083 --> 01:23.697

What about one for the girl
who's throwing the party,

doesn't want those guys
to mess up her parents' house,

01:28.839 --> 01:30.204

Oh, you know,
I've got one, too.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.004
Oh, yeah? Yeah,

Oh.

Ah.
Con?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.309
That's good, man.
Yeah.

That's good. That's
really good. That's good.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.104
A little hostile. It's a
little hostile, but it's good.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.905
Guys, I wrote
a song for Alex

02:05.208 --> 02:06.323
because I'm gonna miss her
so much this weekend,

02:06.627 --> 02:07.833
so let me know
what you think.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.618
Oh, you're just gonna...
You're just gonna play it

02:09.920 --> 02:11.252
right here in the middle
of... Right here in the bar.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.209
J Al, I miss you,
you're the only one

02:13.508 --> 02:15.044

That is an odd way
to phrase that.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.596

me" instead of "home to me"?

That's my girlfriend.
That's weak sauce.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.360
You gotta be like me. Fly
solo. Love is an illusion.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.697
It's like my friend Prison
Johnny always says to me

02:41.995 --> 02:44.111
through the glass, "Don't
get attached to anything

02:44.414 --> 02:45.529
"that you can't walk
away from in 30 seconds

02:45.832 --> 02:47.197
"if the heat
starts a-coming."

02:47.501 --> 02:50.289
Isn't that last part just a
quote from the movie Heat?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.079
Actually, no, David. It's a direct
quote from my original screenplay

02:53.382 --> 02:54.622
Heat 2: It's Getting
Hot Up In Hurr.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.962
And, yes, I wrote
an original screenplay

02:57.260 --> 02:58.796

alone time in the world.

Wow.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.177
That is what 275 pounds
of lonely looks like.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.097
Yeah. He's not having much
luck in the dude department lately.

03:11.400 --> 03:11.764
We need to set him
up with someone.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.023
Yes.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.400
Oh! I got the perfect guy.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.358

to set anyone up. (CHUCKLES)

Padma... (WHISPERS) Eventually.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.823
Well, your guy, my guy...
Doesn't really matter.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.208
All that matters
is that Max is happy.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.461
Of course. Let's let him decide
to probably choose my guy.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.292

with you. This is childish.

the last word.

minutes to go to the airport.

"Get ready to come

03:58.655 --> 04:00.316
"downstairs because
there's no parking."

to phrase that. Isn't it?

Tell him Annie Hall
will be right down.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.451

This is just Overboard.

cut of Overboard...

doesn't learn her lesson in the end

What now? It's my
amateur jerky-making group.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.251
So it's when you and a
bunch of your chef friends

06:19.546 --> 06:21.002
bring your meat down to a
circle and just jerk together?

this stuff?

making me feel all gooey.

It's industrial strength.

uses it to forget the past.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.772
What?
It's perfect.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.433
Wait. Alex did this
when she was five?

07:24.736 --> 07:25.817
Her hands were gigantic.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.398
Okay, Alex,
give me your hand.

(GASPS)

07:33.536 --> 07:34.776
Et voila.

07:35.080 --> 07:35.990
You can barely tell
it was broken.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.404
Right?
We did it!

07:37.707 --> 07:38.447
Yeah!
(LAUGHS)

07:38.750 --> 07:39.785
Suck it, Tyler.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.076
I Suck it forever, Tyler

07:42.379 --> 07:43.790
(FALSETTO VOICE)
J Suck it, suck it, Tyler

07:44.089 --> 07:46.251
(LAUGHS)
I Squawk about us now

07:46.549 --> 07:48.460
IS Squawk about us now, baby,
squawk about us now

07:48.760 --> 07:49.374
IS Squawk about us, now, baby,
squawk about us J

07:49.678 --> 07:50.668
Oh! (GASPS)

07:53.932 --> 07:55.218
Taking a nap, buddy?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.142
Tuckered out
from all that racism?

08:00.397 --> 08:01.637
Someone's pooped.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.851
(BABY VOICE)
Someone's pooped.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.061
(BABY VOICE) Ty-Ty's
a little ti-ti, aren't you?

08:06.361 --> 08:07.817
Looks like our little
baby-waby... (BLABBERING)

08:08.113 --> 08:08.978
(NORMAL VOICE) He's dead.

08:09.280 --> 08:09.860
Oh, my God!
Ahhh!

08:12.909 --> 08:14.149
Come on. Clear.
Huh!

08:15.495 --> 08:16.326
Clear!

08:16.621 --> 08:17.986
Oh!

08:18.289 --> 08:19.245
You can't just poke him
with a pencil and say "Clear."

08:19.541 --> 08:21.248
We need defibrillators.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.159
Well, I don't have bird
defibrillators, now do |, Penny?

08:23.461 --> 08:24.792
| saw 'em
in the SkyMall catalog,

08:25.088 --> 08:27.295
but, no, I just had to get
my marshmallow gun.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.627
Damn you, Brad!
Damn you to hell!

08:29.926 --> 08:31.212
(GRUNTS) Face it,
Brad. Tyler's dead.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.876
Yeah, 'cause your
stupid glue killed him.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.260
And now Alex is gonna
totally know it's our fault

08:34.556 --> 08:36.092
when she reads
the bird autopsy.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.472
Ow!
That's not a real thing!

08:37.767 --> 08:41.304
Fudge. Now I need you
to shush so I can think.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.890
Okay. We need to cover this
up. We need to cover this up.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.431
What would Kerry
Washington do in Scandal?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.225
Demand to see the president,
then almost make out with him.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.484
Exactly.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.269
| know. (LAUGHS)

08:51.573 --> 08:52.938
We make it seem like
he flew out of the window.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.107
That's brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?

08:55.410 --> 08:56.696
Oh, right, because his
wings are clipped, you dunce!

08:57.287 --> 08:59.779
Ow!

09:00.081 --> 09:01.196
But if his wings are clipped,
we can make it look like

09:01.499 --> 09:03.331
he fell out of the window.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.536
Now that's brilliant.
(CHUCKLES)

09:05.378 --> 09:06.994
(SIGHS)

09:07.297 --> 09:09.538
You know, the first two slaps
| get, no notes on those.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.754
But the third? Like, our
ideas were pretty similar.

09:13.053 --> 09:13.713
If anything,
| got us in the area.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.839
Congratulations, Brad.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.177
You pitched an area.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.974
Hey, dum-dums. So you
remember how you two dum-dums

09:25.273 --> 09:26.889
pitched me the idea
of setting me up,

09:27.192 --> 09:28.808
and at first, I was like, "What
a couple of dum-dums"?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.726
But I think I might've found
a guy I really like.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.146
Really?
Oh, hell, yeah!

09:34.449 --> 09:37.612
Which is why | came
over here to give you each

09:37.911 --> 09:39.493
a choice bottle of wine
to say thank you.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.698
(GASPS)
Then I remembered

09:40.997 --> 09:42.954
those choice bottles
of wine I speak of,

09:43.249 --> 09:44.910
| stole them
from that wine rack.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.541
So mentioning wine at all
would just

09:46.836 --> 09:48.452
raise more questions
than the gesture was worth.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.213
Uh, I'm over here biting
my nails. Who'd you choose?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.465
Did you choose Ben or Jamie?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.090
Can I get a drumroll,
please?

09:57.972 --> 10:00.304
Neither of 'em. Did not
care for either of 'em.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.183
But during the second
disaster of a date,

10:03.478 --> 10:06.140
| did meet a super cute
bartender named Marcus.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.804
We have all
the same interests.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.598
Love Ryan Reynolds,
hate Ryan Reynolds' movies.

10:09.901 --> 10:10.561
So I'm seeing him tonight.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.102
Yay!
Yay!

10:14.405 --> 10:15.520
That is awesome.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.529
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.236
Thrilled for you, Max.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.947
But can we just put it
in reverse for a sec

10:21.246 --> 10:22.532
and just go back to
that little thing about you

10:22.831 --> 10:24.697
not really caring
for either of our guys?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.956
Uh, specifically,
my guy Ben.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.334
Hmm. (CLICKS TEETH)
Ben. Yeah.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.540
You know,
Ben just wasn't my type.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.298
He also weirdly
reminded me of someone.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.708
You get John Mayer's
latest?

10:37.011 --> 10:39.002
That guy starts at love
and just floors it.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.887
Wow. | love the
shape of your face.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.843
Whoa.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.804
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
that line is a boxer-dropper

10:45.103 --> 10:46.593
if ever I heard one.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.105
But who is it... Who is it
that he reminds you of?

10:50.400 --> 10:53.483
Well, it seems like Dave's
guy has deuced the futon.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.689
Oh. But what could possibly
be wrong with my guy?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.650
Jamie? (CLICKS TONGUE)
He just wasn't my type either,

10:57.949 --> 10:59.360
to tell you the truth.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.117
He also reminded me
of someone. Really?

11:02.412 --> 11:05.575
I've taken the liberty of
writing up our date itinerary.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.239
It's laminated, SO NO
worries if you spill salsa on it.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.370
But don't.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.124
Seriously, don't.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.287
(CLATTER)

11:13.590 --> 11:16.002
A laminated itinerary is
just good planning. Is it?

11:16.301 --> 11:17.962
Huh. But that is
not what matters.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.504
What matters is that you and
your new friend, Marcus, are happy.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.342
So jazzed for you.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.006
So jazzed for you, Max.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.347
Great. Well, I got
to skedaddle.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.224
Meeting Marcus later.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.982
And let me tell you, | plan on
wining, dining, and 79'ing him.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.518
And, yes, if you're
wondering, that is 10 better.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.153
BRAD: Oh. Ooh.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.735
All right, Brad, let's
get our stories straight.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.110
Tired of Alex's diverse
group of friends,

11:45.413 --> 11:46.903
Tyler finally decided
to make a break for it.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.663
Okay.
Leaving behind

11:48.958 --> 11:51.120
this trail of feathers, he
made his way to the window,

11:51.419 --> 11:52.909
pausing only to poo

11:53.213 --> 11:55.250
on this Newsweek
with Obama on the cover.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.334
(DEEPENED VOICE)
Butt full of bigotry.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.250
Then he pecked through the
screen, leaving behind this...

12:01.012 --> 12:03.128
Cartoonish,
parrot-shaped hole?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.342
(WHINES)
Brad, you had one job.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.553
Maybe I made enough room for
my conscience to fit through.

12:07.852 --> 12:08.762
Ugh. Okay, whatever.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.812
He pecked through the screen,
tried to fly, but couldn't,

12:13.107 --> 12:15.189
and then fell to his death.
It's the perfect crime.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.476
(WHISPERS) Wow. Now
the only thing left is one of us

12:17.779 --> 12:19.144
needs to toss this guy into
the dumpster. Nice and easy.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.740
Yep, just, uh, take
that nasty, dead bird

12:24.035 --> 12:24.991
and throw him in the
trash. Easy-peasy.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.242
(CHUCKLES)

12:29.374 --> 12:30.705
BOTH: Ew! Ew! Ew!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.115
(BOTH SCREAM)

12:32.835 --> 12:33.950
(THUDS)

12:34.254 --> 12:35.836
(SIGHS)
Oh.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.246
To Max
and his new guy Marcus.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.041
So, so, so,
so happy for Max.

12:41.344 --> 12:44.336
You know what thought
| just cannot shake, though,

12:44.639 --> 12:47.506
is how did Max and
Jamie not hit it off?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.641
Delete Jamie and
replace him with Ben,

12:49.936 --> 12:51.347
and you've got what's
going on inside my noodle.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.307
| mean, tether me
back to earth here,

12:53.606 --> 12:55.643
but Jamie is a catch.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.183
Great legs, awesome
take charge personality.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.692
Max needs that.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.151
And call me crazy,
but Ben is a dream, right?

13:03.449 --> 13:04.939
| mean, (IN SPANISH ACCENT)
describe me loco,

13:05.243 --> 13:06.733
(NORMAL ACCENT)
but what is Max thinking?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.744
| mean, up is down,
acoustic guitars are lame,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.451
Mayer is bad?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.708
| mean, when did
we all turn on Mayer?

13:16.004 --> 13:19.247
Well... Pretty much
right off the bat.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.881
But you know, the more
we talk about Ben and Jamie,

13:22.176 --> 13:24.713
the more I see that you
and |, without realizing it,

13:25.013 --> 13:26.879
set Max up with two guys
that are exactly like

13:29.017 --> 13:30.633
two of the best dudes
in town.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.427
Thank you. And who is
this Marcus guy?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.095
| mean, that name...

13:35.398 --> 13:37.685
Oh. God, it sounds black.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.315
(GROANS) Which is the
only thing | like about it.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.645
Otherwise, I hate that guy.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.856
But, we are missing
the point.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.113
Max is happy.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.864
Yes. That is all
that matters.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.399
Max is happy.

13:49.120 --> 13:49.734
To Max.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.989
Still...

13:54.292 --> 13:54.872
Mmm-hmm.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.204
Mmm.

13:57.503 --> 13:57.992
How can you eat bird
right now?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.837
| can't eat.
| can't sleep.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.247
All I hear is Tyler.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.382
(SQUAWKS)
You killed me.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.088
But a white guy would've
killed me better. (WHISTLES)

14:06.387 --> 14:07.843
Maybe we should
just confess to Alex.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.755
Hey, lady,
the only way we get caught

14:10.058 --> 14:12.049
is if you blow this for us,
so just keep it together.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.511
Fine. I won't sing.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.895
But there's no way anyone
in the world is stupid enough

14:18.191 --> 14:19.477
to believe that bird
fell out the window.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.392
Guys, my bird fell out
the window! (SQUAWKS)

14:21.694 --> 14:22.650
(SOBBING)
Tyler's dead.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.811
Oh, my God.
| am so sorry.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.821
What a terrible accident,
I'm assuming.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.107
| have no idea what happened.
The screen was popped open,

14:29.410 --> 14:30.946
there was feathers
everywhere.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.532
He dropped some farewell heat
on my Obama Newsweek.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.912
Wow. (HIGH-PITCHED
VOICE) Not the Newsweek.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.290
Dark days. Dark days.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.289
But you need to move on.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.670
My advice would be to not
ask anyone any questions

14:42.965 --> 14:44.876
about anything at all
ever again.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.883
It's called closure.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.839
You know what? You're
right. Yes, you're right.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.129
Sweet, sweet closure.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.922
These are dang good.
(CHUCKLES)

14:53.226 --> 14:54.307
Mmm. Of course, the
real closure will come

14:54.602 --> 14:55.216
when I get
the autopsy report back.

14:58.231 --> 14:58.936
Lord have mercy.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.478
| don't like talking about my sex
dreams that much, but it was me,

15:05.780 --> 15:08.112
Jeff Van Gundy;,
and Stan Van Gundy.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.490
No. | had Jeff coaching
me on defense,

15:10.785 --> 15:11.775
and Stan coaching me
on offense.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.161
Max, I didn't know
you come here.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.117
We spend half our
lives here, Jane.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.498
Me? Just hanging out with Jamie.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.830
Great guy, by the way.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.541
He said he is dying to go
on another date with you,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.751
and then boom,
fate takes the wheel

15:26.050 --> 15:28.166
and parallel parks us
next to you...

15:28.469 --> 15:29.504
And your doughy friend.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.795
Whoa.
Actually, Jane,

15:32.098 --> 15:34.635
you said it was Max who
was dying to go out with me.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.265
Did she now? Max,
are you dating this guy?

15:36.561 --> 15:38.393
Who? Neil Patrick Niles? No.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.929
Max, I did not know
that you come here.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.768
You mind if me and
Mr. Wonderful circle up?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.399
Yeah, I mind.
| mind a lot.

15:45.695 --> 15:46.981
Great. (IMITATES SPANISH
ACCENT) We doing single sangrias

15:47.280 --> 15:48.520
or should I order
el carafe?

15:48.823 --> 15:52.032
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

15:52.326 --> 15:53.862
No carafes.
JAMIE: None for me.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.244
| don't put Spanish
beverages in French containers

15:56.539 --> 15:59.452
because I'm not, as you would
probably say, muy gauche.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.990
JANE: (LAUGHS) Plus fruit
garnishes carry more diseases

16:01.294 --> 16:02.955
than Kevin Smith's
refrigerator handle.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.753
Okay, what's going on here?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.538
| can explain, Marcus.
JANE: Allow me.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.209
Our buddy max here
makes terrible decisions,

16:10.511 --> 16:12.593
but luckily, we know
what's best for him.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.505
Well, when you guys decide
who you want Max to date,

16:15.475 --> 16:16.556
just let me know.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.058
No. Come on, Marcus.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.094
Marcus, this is a bit
of an overreaction.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.183
| mean, this happens
to everybody. Well...

16:23.483 --> 16:25.224
| hope you two idiots
are happy.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.608
| told you, I never wanted
to date Jamie or Ben ever.

16:27.904 --> 16:28.939
Harsh barley, bro.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.979
Is it?
Is it harsh barley?

16:31.282 --> 16:32.488
What is wrong
with Ben and Jamie?

16:32.783 --> 16:33.818
They're you.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.358
(LAUGHS) What?
What?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.493
Are you kidding?
Look at yourselves.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.120
(CHUCKLES) | think you
got all the germs, guys.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.373
And I got Jack Johnson one
and Jack Johnson two over here.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.158
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.203
| don't know how to make
this any clearer to you guys,

16:46.506 --> 16:49.715
but I would never date anyone
even remotely like you two.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.841
You wanted me to be happy?
| almost was,

16:52.136 --> 16:54.047
and then you ruined it.
So if you'll excuse me,

16:54.347 --> 16:55.633
I'm gonna go home,
hard-boil an egg,

16:55.932 --> 16:57.218
and eat it on the toilet.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.131
L'chaim.

17:00.102 --> 17:00.887
Oops.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.177
Yeah.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.351
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)

17:05.650 --> 17:07.435
Thank you guys so much
for paying your respects.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.351
Tyler would be so
touched that you're here.

17:09.654 --> 17:10.894
Well, not you, Brad.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.358
Of course. So, uh,
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

17:13.657 --> 17:15.319
Did you get
the autopsy report or...

17:15.617 --> 17:17.950
Brad, she doesn't want
to talk about that now.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.237
Yeah, but I haven't
read it yet. Just too sad.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.371
(DOOR OPENS)
Mmm. Mmm.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.248
Oh. Tyler's friends
are here.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.284
(WHISTLES) White power.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.041
| should go and say
hello. Excuse me.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.170
Be strong, girl.
Yeah.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.422
Oh, my God. We gotta come clean
now. Please, can we come clean?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.003
| am so scared.
Shush!

17:33.302 --> 17:34.508
She will never know anything

17:34.804 --> 17:36.340
if she never reads
the autopsy report.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.095
That's why you are gonna
find it and destroy it.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.007
What if it was e-mailed
to her as a PDF?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.674
How do you destroy a PDF?
It's in the clouds.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.013
| don't control the clouds.
I'm not Thor!

17:43.312 --> 17:44.393
Shush mouth.
(WHINES)

17:44.981 --> 17:46.722
Now, go. Be a man.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.810
(WHISPERS)
I'll go find it. Ugh!

17:49.110 --> 17:51.226
Well, matchmaker,
matchmaker.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.691
You know, I'd storm out right
now if my love for funeral food

17:53.990 --> 17:56.106
wasn't greater than my
hatred for two selfish jerks.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.026
Max, we're sorry that
we screwed things up.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.910
| mean, we really do
want you to be happy.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.572
Which is why
we tracked Marcus down,

18:03.874 --> 18:04.864
explained to him
what happened,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.657
and told him he'd be lucky
to date a guy like you.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.703
Wow. You guys, thank you.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.622
That's awesome. What,
should I call him or...

18:11.924 --> 18:12.914
Oh...

18:13.217 --> 18:14.457
Absolutely not.
No. No. No. No. No.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.091
No, no, no.
He was pretty upset.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.129
It actually escalated into
a pretty tense situation.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.548
Dave here threw what
he maintains is a punch,

18:21.851 --> 18:24.843
but it looked more like a
figure-skating twirl, like a...

18:25.146 --> 18:27.888
Well, it's called
a haymaker,

18:28.190 --> 18:30.306
<i>which Marcus promptly turned
into a devastating arm bar,</i>

18:30.610 --> 18:32.271
but the good news is
| finally get to get

18:32.570 --> 18:33.935
that Tommy John surgery
I've always wanted, so,

18:35.197 --> 18:36.733
win-win.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.740
Look, we're sorry that
we tried to set you up

18:39.035 --> 18:39.775
with a couple of
lame-os like us.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.114
Guys, you're not lame.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.744
| mean, you are lame,

18:44.040 --> 18:45.121
but it's cool. And the
reason | don't want

18:45.416 --> 18:46.747
to date anyone
like the two of you

18:47.043 --> 18:48.329
is because my pantry's
already stocked

18:48.628 --> 18:50.539
with an awesome Dave
and a kick-ass Jane

18:50.838 --> 18:51.999
and a rat that can
eat through aluminum cans

18:52.298 --> 18:53.254
that I will kill
with these hands.

18:54.258 --> 18:54.963
Hey, bring it in, guys.

18:56.218 --> 18:56.832
(GROANS)

18:57.845 --> 18:58.676
Mmm. Mmm.

19:00.389 --> 19:00.673
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Tommy John.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.590
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)

19:03.893 --> 19:05.224
(SIGHS)

19:05.519 --> 19:06.930
Yes!

19:07.229 --> 19:07.718
ALEX: Brad.
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Ahhh!

19:08.856 --> 19:10.472
Could you please join us?

19:10.775 --> 19:11.936
I'd like to say
a few words about Tyler.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.395
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Uh-huh.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.901
Everybody, please, join me.

19:16.197 --> 19:16.937
(INSTRUMENTAL
AMAZING GRACE PLAYING)

19:17.239 --> 19:18.980
We are all here
to remember Tyler,

19:19.283 --> 19:20.865
a huge racist

19:21.160 --> 19:22.525
and an even
huger-er friend.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.284
He will be missed.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.536
(VOICE BREAKING)
This is so hard.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.117
His death is
particularly troubling to me

19:27.416 --> 19:29.532
because I don't think
it was an accident.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.827
| know that there was a
human hand at work in his death.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.213
(WHIMPERS)
And that human hand was...

19:36.509 --> 19:38.250
Me! Us. Me and Brad. We did it.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.008
We're so sorry.
Tyler was killed

19:40.304 --> 19:42.045
from the glue fumes used
to fix your hand plate.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.838
Also, we broke
your hand plate.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.848
What? Also you had
huge hands as a kid.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.383
And I'm sorry
about that, too.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.722
Yeah, I know that.
(WHISPERS) We're so sorry.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.102
(WHISPERS) So big.
So sorry.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.480
Wait. You guys killed Tyler?

19:52.775 --> 19:53.230
Wait. I thought that's
what you were gonna say.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.937
Who did you think
it was?

19:55.236 --> 19:57.819
Me. Before I went to the
Rom-Com Con, Tyler and I got

19:58.114 --> 19:59.775
into a big argument
about what constitutes

20:00.074 --> 20:01.781
a celebrity apprentice
all-star.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.989
| said Melissa Rivers.
He said Joseph Goebbels.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.244
(STAMMERS) I don't know. |
just thought he was so upset

20:07.540 --> 20:09.281
that he decided
to commit suicide.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.573
| see how you got there.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.617
| can't believe you two.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.161
You killed my parrot
with glue fumes?

20:15.464 --> 20:16.750
(VOICE BREAKS)
| said I'm sorry.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.835
Look at this. "Cause
of death, liver damage.”

20:19.135 --> 20:20.591
Real nice, guys.
(SOBBING)

20:20.886 --> 20:23.719
"Systemic organ failure"?
Oh. Lovely.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.221
"Due to excessive alcohol
consumption"? What?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.846
Who gave him alcohol? Huh?

20:30.146 --> 20:31.602
(COUGHS)
Look at the TV.

20:31.897 --> 20:32.853
You gotta look at
that TV, girl. What??

20:33.149 --> 20:34.435
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

20:34.734 --> 20:36.941
Oh! That.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.853
(CHUCKLES) | had to give
Tyler 'ritas. It was taco Tuesday.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.612
He hated Mexicans,
but he loved their food.

20:41.907 --> 20:42.772
Heard that before.
These hands are clean.

20:43.826 --> 20:44.861
Welp, to Tyler.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.902
To Tyler.
Yes.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.239
Hell, no! I will not
toast to that bird.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.325
He is racist!

20:50.624 --> 20:51.534
You know, one time he
saw me get out of a town car

20:51.834 --> 20:52.494
and asked me
what team I played for?

20:52.793 --> 20:53.624
Sounds like him.

20:53.919 --> 20:54.408
(ALL LAUGH)

20:57.798 --> 21:00.256
<i>DAVE. 3 Tyler, I miss
