WEBVTT

00:11.589 --> 00:13.464
Surprise!

00:14.255 --> 00:15.714
Oh, my god, look at her face!

00:16.589 --> 00:19.839
Seriously, Belinda, you should
have your own wellness center.

00:19.923 --> 00:22.005
<i>I'm someone
who could make that happen.</i>

00:22.089 --> 00:23.214
<i>I got asked out.</i>

00:23.297 --> 00:25.297
He's with a group
from Black Lives Matter.

00:25.673 --> 00:27.881
Yeah, that's
the Bureau of Land Management.

00:28.297 --> 00:29.506
Now, that makes sense.

00:31.756 --> 00:33.881
You work for the same assholes
that stole from you.

00:33.964 --> 00:35.089
I gotta make a living.

00:35.756 --> 00:37.089
I cheated on your mother once.

00:37.422 --> 00:39.464
Are those
the 75,000-dollar bracelets?

00:41.589 --> 00:43.589
You put us
on a boat with a crazy lady

00:43.673 --> 00:45.714
who's having some kind
of fucking memorial service.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.798
She might've mentioned that,
but I--

00:47.881 --> 00:49.089
I want to speak to your boss.

00:49.714 --> 00:51.130
I wanna get you naked.

00:51.464 --> 00:52.631
Let's party tonight.

00:52.714 --> 00:53.798
Armond?

02:45.631 --> 02:47.339
Hey.
-Hey.

02:47.422 --> 02:49.798
What's up?
-Sorry. I couldn't get away.

02:49.881 --> 02:51.923
Come on.
I got a surprise for you.

02:56.089 --> 03:00.589
So, uh, I found us
an empty room and, uh...

03:00.673 --> 03:03.214
I stole a master out of one
of the housekeeper's carts.

03:03.297 --> 03:04.422
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:14.214 --> 03:15.964
God. Shit.

03:22.422 --> 03:23.964
Are we gonna get in trouble?

03:25.297 --> 03:28.047
I thought
I'd locked the door. Fuck.

03:29.172 --> 03:32.047
All right.
Well, see ya on Wednesday?

03:33.339 --> 03:35.297
You mean tomorrow?
You're on second shift.

03:36.422 --> 03:39.214
You said I could pick
my own shifts.

03:39.297 --> 03:41.756
-You said a bunch of shit.
-I forget what I said.

03:41.839 --> 03:44.130
Well, I didn't. You owe me.

03:46.422 --> 03:48.089
Uh, apron.

03:48.172 --> 03:50.297
-You'll need that.
-Bye.

04:22.339 --> 04:25.130
Is that the face you make
when you catch a fish?

04:25.214 --> 04:28.798
When I catch
a good one.

04:35.381 --> 04:37.506
Do you leave this weekend
like you said?

04:44.798 --> 04:49.047
Oh, shit.
It's the cigars.

04:49.130 --> 04:52.089
-You okay?
Yeah.

04:52.172 --> 04:56.047
Let's hang out later, okay?

04:57.547 --> 04:59.297
Like when, do you think?

04:59.381 --> 05:03.005
Uh... I'm not sure. I'll--
I'll try you.

05:03.089 --> 05:07.214
I-- I gotta get some water.

05:21.172 --> 05:23.339
I can't believe
you're leaving soon.

05:23.422 --> 05:25.714
I just-- I want you to stay.

05:26.422 --> 05:27.547
I know.

05:28.589 --> 05:32.798
But it's not up to me.
It's my friend's family.

05:32.881 --> 05:35.673
Your friend... she's a jerk.

05:36.381 --> 05:37.381
What?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.255
What about her?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.130
Well...
-Tell me.

05:42.214 --> 05:45.089
After the show,
she came up to me,

05:45.172 --> 05:46.839
and she was kind of, like,
batting her eyes

05:46.923 --> 05:48.589
and sticking out her tits.

05:49.923 --> 05:50.923
Seriously?

05:51.631 --> 05:53.339
Was she hitting on you?

05:53.422 --> 05:55.005
Well, kind of, yeah.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.255
But I wasn't gonna
do anything, you know?

06:02.923 --> 06:04.172
What's the big deal? I thought--

06:04.255 --> 06:06.297
I thought you said
you didn't tell her about us.

06:06.381 --> 06:07.464
She knows.

06:09.798 --> 06:12.422
-You told her?
-No, but she knows.

06:13.589 --> 06:15.422
That's why she's hitting on you.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.589
That's her twisted
fucking thing.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.839
Paula, don't stress.
Come here. Look at me.

06:28.339 --> 06:29.631
I only want you.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.422
I made you this.

06:55.964 --> 06:57.005
It's beautiful.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.631
-You like it?
-Yeah.

07:05.506 --> 07:08.005
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Try it on.

07:22.839 --> 07:25.756
I, uh, I think you should
really stay. I mean...

07:25.839 --> 07:28.047
I know my place isn't big,
but you'll fit.

07:30.881 --> 07:33.839
I mean, we'd have so much fun,
you know?

07:35.964 --> 07:37.506
I-- I'm not staying.

07:41.005 --> 07:43.839
I have college and a whole life
to get back to, and...

07:45.714 --> 07:50.047
honestly, Kai, I-- I doubt
we'll ever see each other again.

07:51.714 --> 07:54.172
I-- I-- I'm just being straight
with you.

07:56.089 --> 07:57.089
Yeah.

07:58.130 --> 07:59.172
Okay.

08:02.047 --> 08:03.089
But I...

08:04.255 --> 08:05.673
I really like you.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.547
I really do, and...

08:09.589 --> 08:11.255
I feel for you, and...

08:12.506 --> 08:14.881
your situation and your family,

08:14.964 --> 08:17.214
and-- and everything
you told me, and...

08:19.756 --> 08:21.255
maybe I could help you.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.214
Help me?

08:27.422 --> 08:28.464
How?

08:30.547 --> 08:31.798
I could give you something.

08:34.005 --> 08:37.381
I-- well, I can't really
give it to you, but...

08:39.255 --> 08:40.756
I can help you take it.

09:06.047 --> 09:07.839
Now lift it
out there. Hold it right.

09:11.422 --> 09:12.756
Oh, we're running.

09:21.214 --> 09:22.798
Oh, brother Quinn? What's good?

09:22.881 --> 09:24.964
Hey, you-- you guys
headed out already?

09:25.047 --> 09:27.506
Fuck yeah, bro.
We're training every day.

09:27.589 --> 09:29.381
Fuck. Whoa! That's cool.

09:29.464 --> 09:30.798
-It l-- it looks fun.
-Oh, yeah.

09:30.881 --> 09:32.214
We got a space for one more guy.

09:32.297 --> 09:34.839
Desi's still all fucking drunk.
Wanna come? Get in.

09:36.714 --> 09:39.172
Come on, you fucker.
What you waiting for? Get in.

09:40.297 --> 09:41.714
I mean, I won't be any good,
you know?

09:41.798 --> 09:43.339
I'd just slow you all down.

09:43.422 --> 09:46.089
We could use the dead weight.
Make us stronger.

09:46.172 --> 09:47.381
Come on, bro. Get in.

09:47.464 --> 09:49.589
Come in, bro.
Come on, bro.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.089
Oh, get in back? Oh.

09:52.172 --> 09:53.923
-Here?
-Yeah.

09:54.005 --> 09:55.756
Man, you a slow haole.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.172
Fuck it. Go around.

09:57.255 --> 09:59.255
-Thanks, dude.
Here we go.

10:36.381 --> 10:39.339
Why did you tell the kids
how much you spent
on my bracelets?

10:40.923 --> 10:43.130
I just told Quinn.

10:43.214 --> 10:44.839
I don't know, I just think
it makes us...

10:44.923 --> 10:47.506
sound kind of materialistic.

10:47.589 --> 10:49.506
I mean, without the context,
you know,

10:49.589 --> 10:51.381
of why you bought them.

10:52.547 --> 10:54.214
Well, I gave him the context.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.130
What?

10:56.214 --> 10:58.297
I did. I gave him the context.

10:58.381 --> 11:02.923
We were having a conversation
about sex and relationships

11:03.005 --> 11:05.923
and men and women, and I just
wanted to be real with him.

11:08.047 --> 11:09.923
But we agreed to not do that.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.631
Well...
...look, I wanna have

11:14.714 --> 11:17.381
an honest relationship
with my son.

11:18.589 --> 11:19.714
Okay.

11:21.756 --> 11:22.881
But, Mark...

11:24.089 --> 11:28.130
I am very curious to hear
what you said exactly.

11:30.089 --> 11:34.964
I said that I had an affair,
and that I regretted it,

11:35.047 --> 11:37.923
and that it-- it was
the worst period of my life.

11:38.005 --> 11:39.631
That's exactly what I said.

11:40.923 --> 11:42.631
Do you see how that's selfish,
Mark?

11:43.673 --> 11:46.297
Well, I think he took it
pretty well.

11:46.381 --> 11:47.923
Selfish in regards to me.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.506
To me.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.839
Because I have a relationship
with him too.

11:52.923 --> 11:55.589
And now I'm gonna have
to talk to Quinn and explain

11:55.673 --> 11:57.339
how I feel about it all,

11:57.422 --> 11:58.923
and why I never told him
about it,

11:59.005 --> 12:02.547
and then I'm gonna have
to have a similar conversation
with Olivia.

12:02.631 --> 12:05.547
And I don't wanna have
to talk about it with them.

12:05.631 --> 12:07.631
I don't wanna have
to talk about it at all.

12:08.714 --> 12:09.798
I'm on vacation.

12:09.881 --> 12:13.839
I'm trying to unwind
from the stress that is my life.

12:17.547 --> 12:19.047
Well, I think it can wait.

12:19.130 --> 12:21.506
I mean, it's not like he had
a lot of follow-up questions,

12:21.589 --> 12:24.381
and I don't think he wants
to talk about it either.

12:24.464 --> 12:26.339
No, yeah, yeah. N...

12:26.422 --> 12:29.172
Nobody wants to talk
about your affair, Mark...

12:31.005 --> 12:33.506
which is why we agreed
to not talk about it.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.214
'Cause I'm still
in a lot of pain.

12:44.005 --> 12:46.506
And it still
hurts me a lot.

12:48.089 --> 12:49.881
And I want it to be over.

12:50.756 --> 12:53.005
And I want it
to be behind us.

12:53.089 --> 12:56.506
And you bring it up
again? Here?

12:58.589 --> 12:59.798
Why?

13:03.506 --> 13:04.547
I'm sorry.

13:07.381 --> 13:09.964
Mom, do you have any aspirin?
Paula has a migraine.

13:10.047 --> 13:12.756
I have some Advil in my, um,
makeup bag.

13:12.839 --> 13:15.756
Wha--
She's allergic to Ibuprofen.

13:15.839 --> 13:17.547
-Of course she is.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.839
Don't you have anything else?

13:21.923 --> 13:22.923
Um...

13:24.381 --> 13:25.798
What's wrong?

13:25.881 --> 13:28.714
I have some Aleve
in my purse in-- in the bar.

13:55.422 --> 13:57.464
-Hope you enjoy your breakfast.
-Thank you.

13:57.547 --> 13:59.172
-This is for you, sir.
-Hey, thanks.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.881
Shane, doesn't this remind you

14:00.964 --> 14:03.005
of the heritage house
where we stayed in Manila?

14:03.089 --> 14:05.089
Uh...

14:05.172 --> 14:08.255
Yeah.

Uh, the Volkmers have just
checked out

14:23.422 --> 14:24.714
of the Pineapple Suite.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.339
-Oh!
And I have made it

14:26.422 --> 14:28.422
the top priority
of our housekeeping team.

14:28.506 --> 14:30.130
So we should be able
to get you in there

14:30.214 --> 14:32.130
-by midday today.
-Great.

14:32.214 --> 14:34.005
Now, this is the one

14:34.089 --> 14:35.714

14:35.798 --> 14:37.339
-Precisely.
-Oh, good.

14:37.422 --> 14:40.214
I'm just double-checking
'cause there's been
so much confusion with the room.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.381
I know.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.381
I basically flew here just
because I did the booking,

14:43.464 --> 14:46.589
and I felt like I had failed
my only son and his new bride.

14:46.673 --> 14:47.631
Mom.

14:47.714 --> 14:49.547
Can I get a latte, please?
No foam.

14:49.631 --> 14:51.923
-No foam latte, great.
Thank you.
Absolutely.

14:52.005 --> 14:55.422
No, it was 100 percent
our mistake.

14:55.506 --> 14:57.381
I planned the wedding.
I planned the honeymoon.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.631
But I've been everywhere
in Hawaii.

14:58.714 --> 15:01.422
And of course,
I have very strong opinions.

15:01.506 --> 15:03.339
I usually stay
at the Mauna Kea,

15:03.422 --> 15:05.881

after this very quickly

15:05.964 --> 15:08.214
with a great girlfriend
from forever ago,

15:08.297 --> 15:10.631
Miss Porter's School for Girls,

15:10.714 --> 15:12.506
-Cathy Clements.
Yes.

15:13.255 --> 15:15.881
But... I've lost my point.

15:15.964 --> 15:17.839
I lost my train of thought.
What was I saying?

15:17.923 --> 15:19.881
Mom, what--
Mom, what is your point?

15:19.964 --> 15:24.172
My point is I read somewhere
in Conde Nast

15:24.255 --> 15:27.089
that said this was
the most romantic hotel

15:27.172 --> 15:29.589
in Hawaii, and I thought, "Well,
that's where they need to go."

15:29.673 --> 15:31.631
Because my baby
deserves the best.

15:31.714 --> 15:32.881
Thanks, Mom.

15:36.047 --> 15:38.172
Well, if you'd like
to put your luggage together,

15:38.255 --> 15:39.923
I'll have the bellman
move them over

15:40.005 --> 15:41.339
when the room is ready.

15:41.422 --> 15:43.339
You know,
the number you gave me

15:43.422 --> 15:48.130
for the general manager on, uh,
this card.

15:49.297 --> 15:50.673
no longer in service.

15:51.464 --> 15:52.506
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:52.589 --> 15:54.673
-Oh, that's odd.
-Is it?

15:55.673 --> 15:57.089

your office last night just

15:57.172 --> 15:59.547

wasn't working but, uh,

16:00.506 --> 16:02.339
you were occupied.

16:02.422 --> 16:05.089
-Well, very sorry about that.
-Yeah.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.673
And you were really,

31:24.964 --> 31:26.047
Absolutely.

something to drink?
-Mm-mm.

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

Yeah.
I'll be right back with that.

then maybe if I'm just honest

36:47.005 --> 36:48.589

50:42.673 --> 50:44.756
Well. Oh, perfect.

50:46.839 --> 50:48.589
I thought
you were gonna text me earlier.

50:48.673 --> 50:52.214
Oh, yeah. Well, I--
I got caught up, uh, you know,

50:52.297 --> 50:54.422
-watching the Nuggets.
-Oh.

50:55.005 --> 50:56.464
You look great.

50:57.381 --> 50:59.631
Oh. I do?

50:59.714 --> 51:03.214
Uh-huh. It was fun last night.

51:07.381 --> 51:09.381
And we can have fun again.

51:22.547 --> 51:27.547
So, how was, uh, scuba diving?

51:27.631 --> 51:29.506
Uh... I don't know.
Uh... I didn't do it.

51:30.923 --> 51:32.172
I wanna wait for you.

51:34.506 --> 51:35.923
You do?

51:36.005 --> 51:38.339
The guy said
we could go out tomorrow.

51:39.589 --> 51:40.631
Wow.

51:41.673 --> 51:43.214
It hurts to smile.

51:44.130 --> 51:46.047
How bad does it look?

51:46.130 --> 51:47.464
It looks cool, Dad.

51:48.339 --> 51:49.631
You look like a badass.

51:49.714 --> 51:53.881
Yeah?
-Yeah, Dad. You saved Mom.

51:54.631 --> 51:57.589
You're a total stud.

51:57.673 --> 52:00.506
I don't know about that.

52:21.172 --> 52:22.839
Goodbye.
Yeah.

52:22.923 --> 52:25.798
Oh, I'm leaving super early,
so you won't see me,

52:25.881 --> 52:27.964
but I love you guys.

52:28.047 --> 52:30.923
I'm so happy I got to see you.

52:31.005 --> 52:32.631
You're such a gorgeous couple,

52:32.714 --> 52:36.172
you have so much going for you,
so be happy, okay?

52:36.631 --> 52:37.881
Just be happy.

52:38.714 --> 52:40.756
-I love you.
-I love you, darling.

52:40.839 --> 52:42.089
Thanks for coming.

52:45.839 --> 52:47.381
Be happy, Rachel.

52:48.631 --> 52:49.964
Okay?

52:53.839 --> 52:55.047
I love you, guys.

52:55.130 --> 52:56.714
And I'll tell Cathy
you say hi!

52:56.798 --> 52:59.214
And enjoy Tahiti!
I'm so jealous!

52:59.297 --> 53:00.923
Yeah. Travel safe.

53:01.005 --> 53:02.964
Love you, Mom.
-That was such a nice dinner.

(STUTTERS, GRUNTS) Greg, Greg.

53:30.964 --> 53:31.964
What?

53:35.673 --> 53:36.798
Greg, come on.

53:39.464 --> 53:40.798
You need to go.

53:41.964 --> 53:45.214
What? Why?

53:45.297 --> 53:49.547
Well, you know, eventually,
you're just gonna leave.

53:49.631 --> 53:52.839
So I think we should just cut
to the chase.

53:52.923 --> 53:54.381
Okay? Let's just go.

53:54.464 --> 53:56.047
Huh?
-Okay. We need to go now.

53:56.130 --> 53:59.464
What?
-Yeah, I mean it.

54:02.464 --> 54:05.881
I'm a very needy person,

54:05.964 --> 54:10.130
and I am deeply,
deeply insecure.

54:10.923 --> 54:12.172
-This is--
-Hmm.

54:12.255 --> 54:16.214
Both my parents
mentally abused me and--

54:16.297 --> 54:21.964
and-- and my mother still
tortures me, and she's dead.

54:22.047 --> 54:26.297
And I still have her ashes.
I carry them around.

54:35.089 --> 54:39.464
So now you see,
that's the core of the onion.

54:42.673 --> 54:45.673
It's already--

54:46.339 --> 54:47.464
This is it.

54:47.547 --> 54:51.547
This is the core of the onion,
and I don't want to--

54:51.631 --> 54:54.673
I want you to get out of here
and save yourself

54:54.756 --> 54:58.130
because I'm just like a--
I'm like a dead end, you know?

54:58.214 --> 55:02.381
This is a trap door.
And I think you should get out.

55:02.464 --> 55:04.297
And I want you
to take these things.

55:04.381 --> 55:05.547
-Whoa.
-I want you take 'em.

55:05.631 --> 55:07.839
I want you to get out
of here now!

55:07.923 --> 55:09.881
The f-- I'm not gonna take
your dead mother's ashes.

55:09.964 --> 55:11.506
I want you to get them
out of here.

55:11.589 --> 55:13.172
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with them?

55:13.255 --> 55:15.130
I don't know. Put them
in the trunk of your car.

55:15.214 --> 55:16.547
Just get them out of here.

55:16.631 --> 55:18.297
You can put them in a trashcan.

55:18.381 --> 55:20.798
-You're fucking crazy.
-It's who I am.

55:20.881 --> 55:22.964
And I-- There's nothing
I can do about it.

55:23.047 --> 55:28.339
Please get out.
Please. Get out.

55:28.422 --> 55:31.339
Greg, I told you
to get the fuck out.

55:33.214 --> 55:34.214
No.

55:37.214 --> 55:38.756
I still wanna fuck you.
