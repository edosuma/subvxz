00:01.059 --> 00:03.211
- Come on!
- Turn it on, brotha.

00:03.377 --> 00:04.582
I'm trying, brother.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.018
Let's go! Panini are
gettin' cold, brother.

00:07.086 --> 00:08.216
It won't work, brother.

00:08.382 --> 00:09.253
Then how are we gonna watch

00:09.321 --> 00:11.289
<i>Monday Night Raw,</i>
brother?

00:11.357 --> 00:12.423
Yeah.

00:12.491 --> 00:14.931
Yo, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Relax, brother!

00:15.097 --> 00:18.296
<i>Wrestlemania 28</i> is--
is happening in 72 hours.

00:18.364 --> 00:19.645
We're hosting it.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.063
We're known for this party.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.001
And we have a pack
of giant dudes comin' over.

00:23.068 --> 00:24.816
John Paul's dad is coming over.

00:24.982 --> 00:27.944
I'm just saying that
maybe we don't need a tv.

00:28.110 --> 00:32.491
We've got
an entire wall of entertainment.

00:36.744 --> 00:39.000
Aah!

00:39.068 --> 00:40.290
Aah!

00:40.456 --> 00:41.875
- Hi-ya!
- Hi-ya!

00:42.041 --> 00:44.539
Whoo!

00:44.606 --> 00:46.963
- Oh, ho, yeah!
- Nice!

00:47.129 --> 00:48.042
I wanna do a book grenade.

00:48.110 --> 00:49.110
- Do it, bub.
- All right.

00:49.178 --> 00:50.676
- Light it, light it.
- This is fun.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.636
- Light it up.
- Now we're cookin'.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.048
- All right, that one.
- Let's do it, man.

00:54.116 --> 00:55.249
Oh, dude, your hair's on fire!

00:55.317 --> 00:56.451
- What?
- Your hair!

01:04.827 --> 01:05.941
I'm okay!

01:06.107 --> 01:07.728
- That was awesome!
- We have to get a tv.

01:07.796 --> 01:09.528
Yes, tv, definitely.

01:21.747 --> 01:25.460
Okay, everyone, eyes up here.

01:25.626 --> 01:27.879
Jet set, could you take
the headphones off, please?

01:28.045 --> 01:29.339
They're not on.

01:29.505 --> 01:30.985
Okay, great.

01:31.053 --> 01:34.845
So, uh, we have
a very special treat today.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.055
It seems the folks at frostwell
have decided

01:37.221 --> 01:40.294
that the first person
to sell 20 units is going to get

01:40.362 --> 01:43.478
a brand new, top-of-the-line
glacier refrigerator.

01:43.644 --> 01:44.604
What?

01:44.770 --> 01:45.950
So if you make a sale,

01:46.018 --> 01:49.359
just come on down
and ring the frostwell bell.

01:49.525 --> 01:51.153
- Well, there goes our nap time.
- Yeah.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.154
Jillian.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.739
Ah!

01:53.905 --> 01:55.741
Why is there
a refrigerator in here?

01:55.907 --> 01:58.243
- Guys.
- Tv.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.369
Jet set, just--

01:59.535 --> 02:00.829
- <i>wrestlemania.</i>

02:00.995 --> 02:04.302
Good luck, chumps. I'm takin'
my life to the next level.

02:04.369 --> 02:06.042
Gonna get that garage fridge.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.961
That's
a living room television.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.473
Garage fridge.

02:10.542 --> 02:13.049
Strictly venison.
All deer everything.

02:13.215 --> 02:14.718
We should buy deer.
Where do you buy deer at?

02:14.884 --> 02:17.615
I hunt, man. You don't think
black folks can hunt?

02:17.683 --> 02:19.183
I ski, snorkel.

02:19.251 --> 02:22.142
We're takin'
this whole [Bleep] Over.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.188
Wait, he's black?

02:24.256 --> 02:26.062
There's no way to tell.

02:26.228 --> 02:27.158
Okay, guys, uh, don't forget

02:27.226 --> 02:28.859
to grab your leads
on the way out,

02:28.927 --> 02:30.901
and, oh--and, uh, I'd like
to introduce you to Naomi.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.498
She's going to be temping
for al today,

02:34.566 --> 02:37.101
and she actually just moved here
from Australia.

02:37.169 --> 02:40.076
Hi, everyone.
It's a pleasure to be here.

02:40.242 --> 02:41.912
Ow!

02:42.078 --> 02:43.288
I know.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.874
The one day we need to focus,
and she had to temp.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.751
Don't mind me.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.480
I'll just be here
with my breasts and boobs,

02:49.548 --> 02:51.916
being a girl
as hard as possible.

02:51.984 --> 02:55.008
Freakin' Austrians,
like, land down under.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.803
And you know she just dates
the hottest dudes of all time.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.391
If you don't want to date me,
that's fine. I get that.

03:00.459 --> 03:01.640
But you're wrong,
and I hate you.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.828
Let her date the--
the underwear models

03:03.895 --> 03:05.429
and the pro surfers, okay?

03:05.497 --> 03:07.312
I'm sorry if we're real people.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.647
- We're real.
- So real.

03:08.813 --> 03:09.648
We're the realest people.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.649
- I know.
- So real.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.003
I'm sick of beautiful people

03:12.070 --> 03:13.671
who don't have to work
for their beauty,

03:13.739 --> 03:14.905
when I'm over here,

03:14.973 --> 03:17.008
sweatin' my balls off
for all this beauty.

03:17.075 --> 03:18.824
And you can hardly tell
some days.

03:19.044 --> 03:21.245
Oh, no.
I'm not wearing underwear.

03:21.313 --> 03:22.313
- Mm.
- What happens

03:22.381 --> 03:23.161
when I pre-ejaculate?

03:23.327 --> 03:25.372
No one is going to pre-,
ok?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.998
- I always do.
- Guys! Let's--

03:27.164 --> 03:29.053
let's just think of a flaw,
right? She's not perfect.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.127
Yes, she's exactly what
we want to be raped by, right?

03:31.293 --> 03:32.256
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

03:32.324 --> 03:33.391
But does she have the build

03:33.458 --> 03:35.726
to birth me
my olympic triathlete son?

03:35.794 --> 03:37.962
No. Not with those giant cans
and tapered waist.

03:38.029 --> 03:39.636
I'm sorry.
It's just not gonna happen.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.233
Ders, she has the face
of a God.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.433
If I look directly at her,
I will pre- my pants.

03:45.599 --> 03:46.893
- You pre- a lot too.

03:47.059 --> 03:48.520
You could fill up
an otter pop sleeve.

03:54.312 --> 03:55.652
Oh!

03:55.818 --> 03:57.028
Oh!

03:57.194 --> 03:58.864
Didn't see you there.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.452
I--I'm Jillian belk,
Alice's assistant.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.451
- Oh. Naomi.
- Nice to meet you.

04:03.617 --> 04:05.389
I just wanted to say,
I'm so happy

04:05.457 --> 04:06.991
to have someone here
who's my age and just, like,

04:07.058 --> 04:10.166
- a regular girl.
- Yeah. No, definitely.

04:10.332 --> 04:12.419
Because most of these people
are real creeps.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.462
Really?

04:14.628 --> 04:16.923
Oh, what, you want this?
You want some of this?

04:17.089 --> 04:20.969
No, waymond.
It's not a Warren g music video.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.805
Hey, little dude, what's up?
Is your mom home?

04:25.973 --> 04:28.379
I--
why aren't you at school?

04:28.447 --> 04:30.312
Suspended? Cool.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.717
No, sir,
you're gonna love this...Boob.

04:33.785 --> 04:35.052
Uh, refrigerator.

04:35.120 --> 04:35.942
It's pretty boob.

04:36.108 --> 04:37.721
Look, I'm calling to--

04:37.789 --> 04:40.113
uh, we got refrigerators
that we're selling.

04:40.279 --> 04:41.573
Do you want one?

04:41.739 --> 04:43.461
Only a four-inch blade?

04:43.528 --> 04:45.035
And she grounded you too?

04:45.201 --> 04:46.786
Oh, that is dumb.

04:46.952 --> 04:47.829
Uh, you know what?
I gotta go, man.

04:47.995 --> 04:48.933
Sorry about your dumb mom.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.540
Uh, knives rule!

04:50.706 --> 04:53.585
Hey, um, sorry
to bother you guys.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.962
Oh.
Not a problem, what's up?

04:56.128 --> 04:57.672
Is there a coat rack
around here?

04:57.838 --> 05:00.842
Yeah, it's called
the back of your chair.

05:02.447 --> 05:04.638
Yeah, this ain't
the four seasons so, you know,

05:04.804 --> 05:07.140
get real. Act real.
Why aren't you real?

05:07.306 --> 05:10.435
Yeah. Fo' sure.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.979
Oh, my God.

05:13.145 --> 05:14.773
So how are you guys
going with sales?

05:14.939 --> 05:16.399
I just got my first one.

05:16.565 --> 05:19.296
Wow! We'll call CNN,

05:19.364 --> 05:20.664
and tell Anderson Cooper
about it,

05:20.732 --> 05:22.656
and he'll probably like,
break the story.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.734
Anderson Cooper.

05:23.802 --> 05:24.699
- Break the story.
- Right?

05:24.865 --> 05:25.769
No, but seriously,

05:25.837 --> 05:27.204
how sweet is that new fridge?

05:27.272 --> 05:29.039
It would go perfect
in my new flat.

05:29.107 --> 05:31.509
Oh, yeah, well, you know,
not all of us get what we want.

05:31.576 --> 05:33.875
Some of us have to work
super hard for it,

05:34.041 --> 05:35.126
like, you know,

05:35.292 --> 05:37.147
like real people,
uh, we're real,

05:37.215 --> 05:39.631
and you're not, you're like
an a--you're like an angel.

05:39.797 --> 05:40.840
Yeah.

05:42.424 --> 05:43.551
Uh, is the sorceress gone?

05:43.717 --> 05:44.886
No, man, she's here,
she's still here.

05:45.052 --> 05:46.423
Oh.

05:46.491 --> 05:49.099
Um, okay, well, good luck
with your sales.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.767
Well, uh,

05:50.933 --> 05:53.061
I don't need any luck,
'cause I'm 100% skill, so--

05:53.227 --> 05:55.146
it--I--
you're--

05:55.312 --> 05:56.901
- got her.

05:58.732 --> 06:00.443
What's up, slut?

06:01.819 --> 06:02.973
Oh, my gosh.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.364
You're such a whore.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.616
Bye.
Hey, Jill.

06:06.782 --> 06:07.878
- This is for you.
- Oh!

06:07.946 --> 06:09.202
- Read it.
- Uh, okay.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.122
Oh, but with your voice.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.552
Oh.
Okay, uh...

06:14.619 --> 06:16.376
Will you go to lunch with me?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.294
- And--the--
- Uh,

06:18.460 --> 06:20.630
your close friend, Jillian.

06:20.796 --> 06:22.340
- Well, sure. That sounds great.
- All right.

06:22.506 --> 06:24.259
Uh, do you want to hit up
the steak and shake?

06:24.425 --> 06:25.844
I'm actually a vegetarian.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.846
What?
How do you not eat meat?

06:28.012 --> 06:31.035
- Well--
- Is...

06:31.102 --> 06:34.019
A question that I get asked
all the time by people,

06:34.185 --> 06:37.856
because
I'm also a vegetarian too.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.149
- Oh.
- As well.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.151
So do you want to get
a table for two

06:41.317 --> 06:42.694
at the international
house of salads?

06:42.860 --> 06:45.182
- Okay.
- Later, hooker.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.239
Okay.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.199
- Hey, guys.
- The boobs are like, what--

06:48.365 --> 06:49.784
- hey. I'm sorry,

06:49.950 --> 06:51.255
but you probably
won't be seeing as much of me,

06:51.323 --> 06:54.622
now that I got a new besty--
Naomi. She's very cool.

06:54.788 --> 06:57.628
And don't put meats on my desk.

06:57.696 --> 06:59.502
Just for today.

06:59.668 --> 07:01.031
Chalk it up, boys.

07:01.099 --> 07:03.334
Five fridges in 40 minutes.

07:03.401 --> 07:04.535
It's a land speed record.

07:04.603 --> 07:06.384
- How many y'all got?
- Uh...

07:06.550 --> 07:07.844
- Zero, right now.
- Yeah.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.607
I mean,
how do you even concentrate

07:09.674 --> 07:12.309
with that sex demon Naomi
walkin' around,

07:12.377 --> 07:13.725
smellin' all delicious?

07:13.891 --> 07:15.980
Because I love my wife.

07:16.047 --> 07:19.149
Can't no strange come between
what I got in this bedroom.

07:19.217 --> 07:22.553
You understand? Colleen
got that stingray coochie.

07:22.621 --> 07:23.610
Do you feel me, Ders?

07:23.776 --> 07:24.944
Never do.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.490
You need some love,

07:26.558 --> 07:30.033
'cause it will sustain y'all.

07:30.199 --> 07:34.698
We are t-minus 61 hours
until <i>wrestlemania.</i>

07:34.766 --> 07:36.567
Guys...
Maybe we should just go find

07:36.635 --> 07:37.968
a cheap tv on craigslist.

07:38.036 --> 07:39.637
What a quitter.

07:39.704 --> 07:41.805
There's a free tv out there,
just waiting to be won.

07:41.873 --> 07:44.130
You don't think I know that?
I'm just trying to focus.

07:44.296 --> 07:46.677
Ugh, me too.
It's kind of hard to focus,

07:46.745 --> 07:48.579
especially since I got
one of those fifth grade boners,

07:48.647 --> 07:50.080
where your dick
hasn't fully grown yet,

07:50.148 --> 07:51.715
and all the blood's
rushin' into it,

07:51.783 --> 07:53.651
and it gets super hard.
Remember those?

07:53.718 --> 07:55.986
- Does this look weird?
- What?

07:56.054 --> 07:59.145
Yes! I'm, uh,
tuckin' my boner up.

07:59.311 --> 08:01.147
Oh, yeah, no,
I've been tucked up since jump.

08:01.313 --> 08:03.110
Actually the metal in my belt's
pokin' it a little bit.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.527
- It hurts.
- Guys, what is the plan?

08:05.693 --> 08:08.348
Obviously, we're just gonna
go in the bathroom, masturbate,

08:08.416 --> 08:09.864
maybe once, maybe twice,
who knows?

08:10.030 --> 08:11.085
Try to get everything out.

08:11.152 --> 08:12.086
Come back out here,
get on the phones,

08:12.153 --> 08:13.618
and be sales monsters.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.489
You're gonna crank down
here at the office?

08:15.557 --> 08:16.579
You think that's a smart idea?

08:16.745 --> 08:18.092
People take smoke breaks
all the time.

08:18.159 --> 08:20.667
Yeah. So we'll
take a stroke break.

08:20.833 --> 08:21.918
You can get fired for this.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.130
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

08:23.198 --> 08:24.379
we'll ask Alice first.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.432
That's a worse idea

08:25.500 --> 08:27.048
than just doing it by its own!

08:27.214 --> 08:30.051
You're being a child,
and that's weird,

08:30.217 --> 08:31.705
because you're one of
the oldest people I know.

08:31.773 --> 08:34.541
Blake, shall we?

08:34.609 --> 08:35.765
You're doing it now?
Okay.

08:35.931 --> 08:37.558
This I gotta see.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.227
Alice,

08:39.393 --> 08:42.105
Ders wants to know if he can
masturbate in the office.

08:46.191 --> 08:48.361
♪ You gotta, gotta be fresh ♪

08:48.527 --> 08:50.120
♪ he's insane, ah ♪

08:51.113 --> 08:52.797
Holmvic, get in here.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.667
Mm.

08:55.734 --> 08:57.802
Let me guess, she said no?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.831
Told you guys,
it was stupid to ask. I'm sorry.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.639
Okay, so this isn't a joke?

09:01.707 --> 09:02.792
Oh, no, they're serious.

09:02.958 --> 09:04.169
We've been talking about it
all day.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.543
Anders, I never thought

09:05.611 --> 09:07.412
I would actually
have to say this to you,

09:07.479 --> 09:09.841
but you're not allowed
to masturbate at work.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.382
Sorry, dude,
we tried. Really hard.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.802
Wait, no, no. Me? No.

09:12.968 --> 09:14.319
Them. They want
to masturbate. I--

09:14.386 --> 09:16.055
- oh, what,
so you don't want to crank it?

09:16.221 --> 09:17.265
No, of course, I'd love to,

09:17.431 --> 09:18.975
but I'm not gonna ask her.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.358
Oh, so you're gonna do it
without asking?

09:20.426 --> 09:22.103
Were you raised in a barn,
Anders?

09:22.269 --> 09:24.762
No one is masturbating
anywhere in the office!

09:24.830 --> 09:26.191
Now get out!

09:26.357 --> 09:29.667
- I think that went great.
- What?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.303
Yeah, you heard what she said.
No masturbating in the office.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.032
Skoo!

09:35.657 --> 09:38.828
Oh, this is fun.

09:38.994 --> 09:40.246
It reminds me of, like,

09:40.412 --> 09:41.748
when you were a kid,
and you'd masturbate

09:41.914 --> 09:43.615
in the car
on the way to church.

09:43.682 --> 09:44.792
Did you guys use to do that?

09:44.958 --> 09:46.251
Guys, can we just
make this quick?

09:46.318 --> 09:47.337
I'm pretty sure
we can go to jail for this.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.504
Ders,

09:48.670 --> 09:49.921
can you make some sounds, dude?

09:49.989 --> 09:51.841
I can't really masturbate
when it's too quiet.

09:52.007 --> 09:53.885
- I'm not making sounds for you.
- Oh, that's perfect, thank you.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.345
- Stop--shh!
- Oh! That's even better.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.728
I love it when they shush me.

09:56.795 --> 09:58.129
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.557
Get out of my crank zone!

09:59.723 --> 10:03.561
Sorry, dude, I just have
a seat belt buckle up my ass.

10:03.727 --> 10:06.037
This sucks. We don't have
any porno or anything.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.740
I have literally
no sexual memories.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.075
I haven't had sex
with many girls, truthfully.

10:11.143 --> 10:13.745
But I know who has
some perfect moobs!

10:13.812 --> 10:15.146
- Come on!
- Let me feel those nips!

10:15.214 --> 10:17.015
Get off me! Stop it!
Get off my titties!

10:17.082 --> 10:19.284
- Let me feel those nips!
- Get back in your zone, dude.

10:19.351 --> 10:20.453
My penis is right here.

10:20.619 --> 10:22.787
My zone sucks!
Your zones are so much fun.

10:22.855 --> 10:25.590
You got, like, a steering wheel
to hold on to, extra grip.

10:25.658 --> 10:26.958
You got all that room
back there.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.393
Can I come in your zone, Blake?

10:28.460 --> 10:29.761
Uh, well,

10:29.828 --> 10:31.631
nobody's comin'
in my zone, <i>muchacho,</i> heh.

10:34.366 --> 10:36.034
I'm not used to sitting up
and masturbating.

10:36.101 --> 10:37.735
I'm just punching myself
in the nuts.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.204
Are you guys havin' that?
I have really big balls, though.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.573
So no big deal.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.208
Ders, what's goin' on, buddy?

10:44.276 --> 10:45.228
Pretty quiet over there.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.021
You wanna borrow
some of my lube?

10:47.187 --> 10:48.012
Wait a minute, you've got lube?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.440
- Yeah.
- Pass it back here.

10:49.606 --> 10:50.942
Well, it's not lube,
necessarily.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.650
- Guys.
- It's car wax.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.862
But it's really puttin'
a nice shimmer.

10:55.028 --> 10:56.322
- It's--it's gleaming right now.
- Oh.

10:56.488 --> 10:57.740
I want to show this off.
I want to take--

10:57.906 --> 10:59.033
- just go dry. You're grossing
me out. Please go dry.

10:59.199 --> 11:00.576
You're a dry guy?

11:00.742 --> 11:02.870
Wow, that makes so much sense.

11:03.036 --> 11:04.122
Little known fact--

11:04.288 --> 11:05.763
most serial killers
were dry guys.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.032
I recently read a book on--
on the subject--

11:08.100 --> 11:09.210
it was a blog, but I read it.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.796
That's not true.
I'm a dry guy.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.256
There's a lot of normal guys
out there that are dry guys.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.425
No.
No, creeps are dry guys.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.344
- No, normal people are.
- Fred durst is a dry guy.

11:18.510 --> 11:19.637
That was also part of the blog.

11:19.803 --> 11:21.389
Besides the point,
I don't think it should be

11:21.555 --> 11:23.715
some grand ritual,
where you're gettin' lubes

11:23.782 --> 11:24.976
and lighting candles.
It should just be--

11:25.142 --> 11:25.935
- no candles.

11:26.101 --> 11:27.979
- A spontaneous treat.
- Oh!

11:28.145 --> 11:29.814
Oh, my God, ah!
It's burned my dick.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.691
I think I got some
in my pee-hole.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.027
- Rawr.
- Oof! Whoo!

11:34.193 --> 11:35.361
Oh, I'm going to be
the first one!

11:35.527 --> 11:36.487
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm gonna win.

11:36.653 --> 11:38.281
Ho-o-oly moly!

11:38.447 --> 11:39.615
Oh!

11:43.535 --> 11:46.371
- That did not work out.
- Come on.

11:46.438 --> 11:48.039
Oh! This one goes to 11,

11:48.107 --> 11:49.407
bitches!

11:49.475 --> 11:53.171
If anybody think they can
sell better than monteezy,

11:53.337 --> 11:55.346
be my Christopher guest.

11:55.414 --> 11:56.507
Waymy, come get this bell.

11:56.673 --> 11:58.716
All right. Great job, dude.

11:58.784 --> 12:01.804
- Wow, I hate him. Really!
- Okay, uh--

12:01.970 --> 12:03.821
this has to stop.
How many sales do we have?

12:03.889 --> 12:05.433
- Uh, nearing zero.
- We've got...Yeah, none.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.352
Oh, here--here she comes.
Here she comes, of course.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.593
- Tuck 'em up. Tuck 'em up.
- Tuck 'em up.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.188
- Tuck 'em up.
- Tuck 'em--ow.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.105
- Hey, how are you, chief?
- Hey.

12:11.271 --> 12:12.597
Hi, guys.

12:12.664 --> 12:13.831
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay--

12:13.899 --> 12:15.800
ho-o-oly butt cheeks!
- Are you all right?

12:15.868 --> 12:16.944
- Those are her--
- That's a butt.

12:17.110 --> 12:18.279
- Do you need help?
- I'm sorry.

12:18.445 --> 12:19.947
- That's a--
- That looks like it.

12:20.113 --> 12:21.491
Oh, you got it, you got it.
Help her.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.708
- That was--
- Boys!

12:23.776 --> 12:26.245
This babe has to bounce.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.013
♪ She do what? ♪

12:33.519 --> 12:35.033
Guys, let's just talk to her.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.716
Thanks for lunch, Gil.

12:38.882 --> 12:40.426
Yeah.
Enjoy the spring rolls.

12:40.592 --> 12:42.259
We'll talk
about everything later.

12:42.327 --> 12:43.260
What's up?

12:43.328 --> 12:44.995
- What's up?
- Yo.

12:47.632 --> 12:48.601
Who's that dude?

12:48.767 --> 12:50.133
Oh, uh, that's my boyfriend.

12:50.201 --> 12:51.869
Well, actually...

12:51.936 --> 12:53.940
I don't really know
at the moment.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.818
You're kidding, right?
That's your boyfriend, that guy?

12:56.984 --> 12:59.209
Is or was.

12:59.277 --> 13:00.511
We actually
might be breaking up.

13:00.578 --> 13:02.990
But you dated that dude?
That regular-ass dude?

13:03.156 --> 13:05.118
What?
That's like a five.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.869
What's that guy's story?

13:07.035 --> 13:08.185
Does he do your hair?

13:08.253 --> 13:10.873
He's a gay dude
doin' your hair, huh? Right?

13:11.039 --> 13:13.459
Oh, my gosh!
He's packin' heat, huh?

13:13.625 --> 13:14.919
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yup, yeah, big one.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.671
- Tell me when to stop.
- He's got a huge one? Huge one?

13:16.837 --> 13:18.297
He works at bevmo.

13:18.463 --> 13:19.882
He's a bevmo dude?

13:20.048 --> 13:21.198
- Like, check-out or stock?
- Totally.

13:21.266 --> 13:22.385
'Cause if he's stock,
I know he can lift.

13:22.551 --> 13:23.636
Well,
he seems like a sweetheart,

13:23.802 --> 13:25.888
he seemed--
and also stout.

13:26.054 --> 13:27.181
- Uh-huh.
- And that's important.

13:27.347 --> 13:28.405
- I'm pretty stout as well.
- Hope you guys patch it.

13:28.473 --> 13:29.767
- Hang on just a second.
- Let's just--

13:29.933 --> 13:31.308
- oh, my gosh,
she dates losers.

13:31.376 --> 13:32.643
That means we have a chance.

13:32.710 --> 13:35.379
- She's so ours. She's so ours.
- Let's get her.

13:35.446 --> 13:37.114
Hey, nay-nay.
Are you ready for lunch?

13:37.181 --> 13:40.111
Oh. Gil surprised me and
brought me veggie spring rolls.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.286
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

13:42.353 --> 13:45.032
No, that's--
no, that's fine. That's okay.

13:45.198 --> 13:48.258
Um, I was gonna give this
to you at lunch,

13:48.326 --> 13:50.913
during the second course,
but let's just open it now.

13:51.079 --> 13:52.874
- Thank you. I--
- No, go for it.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.831
- It's crappy wrapping, so just...
- Oh. Okay.

13:54.899 --> 13:56.919
Go for it.
Surprise!

13:57.085 --> 13:58.379
You had no idea

13:58.545 --> 14:01.591
that I was watching you,
and you just looked so peaceful,

14:01.757 --> 14:03.426
so I just snapped a pic.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.760
- Thank you. It's--
- You like it?

14:04.926 --> 14:06.310
- Yeah.
- Yeah, [Bleep] Yeah!

14:06.377 --> 14:08.055
Yes! Whoo!

14:09.473 --> 14:10.975
- Thank you.
- But we should get one of me.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.215
- Yeah?
- Sure. We could do that.

14:12.283 --> 14:13.853
- Okay, cool. That's awesome.
- Okay. Okay.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.396
Did you know that in Africa,

14:15.562 --> 14:18.107
they believe that a picture
captures the soul?

14:18.273 --> 14:20.735
- Holy! Moly!
- Oh!

14:20.901 --> 14:22.526
If she dates
that regular-ass dude,

14:22.594 --> 14:24.697
then you know she's totally
down to d.T.F. All of us.

14:24.863 --> 14:27.497
Hey, may the best
regular-ass dude win, huh?

14:27.565 --> 14:28.951
- Wait a sec.
- How do I look?

14:29.117 --> 14:30.634
That's not gonna work.
We're gonna get backstabby,

14:30.702 --> 14:31.996
it's gonna ruin it
for everyone.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.971
He's right.

14:34.038 --> 14:37.543
Hey! I got it! Let's win
that refrigerator for her.

14:37.709 --> 14:40.004
Yeah, she's been
talkin' about it all day.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.311
We'll give it to her,

14:41.379 --> 14:43.113
and she'll have no choice
but to date one of us.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.051
Women do love electronics.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.683
That is 100% true.

14:46.751 --> 14:50.220
My dad gave my mom a car charger
for her 40th birthday,

14:50.288 --> 14:52.391
and she was just blowin' him
seven days straight.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.391
Demamp power grunt, like, whoa,

14:54.459 --> 14:56.960
comin' through the walls, just--

14:57.028 --> 14:59.106
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

14:59.272 --> 15:01.108
Imagine what we'd get
for a refrigerator.

What the hell
is going on, dudes?

15:54.830 --> 15:57.365
Montez is over there
just runnin' train on us,

15:57.432 --> 15:59.375
and it's hurtin' my pride.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.335
He's just--
he's just a dope salesman.

16:01.501 --> 16:03.087
He's really good,
he's really talented.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.380
- He's like a machine.
- He's like Charlie sheen

16:04.546 --> 16:05.773
- in that movie.
- Stop.

16:05.841 --> 16:06.974
What movie was that?

16:07.042 --> 16:08.718
What the "f" word is happening
right now, guys?

16:08.884 --> 16:09.844
<i>The--the chase.</i>

16:10.010 --> 16:11.178
Okay, look.

16:11.246 --> 16:13.581
Uh, Montez makes a few sales,

16:13.649 --> 16:15.349
and we're ready to crown him
the king--

16:15.417 --> 16:17.184
the hot dog--uh, guy?

16:17.350 --> 16:20.655
No! I am sick of tired

16:20.722 --> 16:23.991
about hearing
what a great salesman Montez is.

16:24.059 --> 16:24.942
Screw him.

16:25.108 --> 16:26.360
- All right.
- Yes!

16:26.526 --> 16:27.653
Cool, what's--
so what's the plan?

16:27.819 --> 16:29.997
Oh, I don't--
I don't know.

16:30.065 --> 16:31.399
- Oh.
- Adam?

16:31.466 --> 16:32.767
- Wow, I'm not good with plans.
- Haven't revved up.

16:32.834 --> 16:36.287
Whoa.
Oh, my God!

16:36.453 --> 16:39.582
What if we gave him
some cold leads?

16:39.748 --> 16:42.109
Adam, the guy Stingrays.

16:42.177 --> 16:43.252
He'd make the sale.

16:43.418 --> 16:44.912
Well, not if he was sellin'

16:44.980 --> 16:47.181
to the coldest lead
of them all.

16:47.249 --> 16:49.091
Me.

16:49.257 --> 16:52.019
- Rich, that's what I'm tell--
- Montez, what up, dog?

16:52.087 --> 16:53.012
Your mustache is looking great

16:53.178 --> 16:55.056
and I just wanted
to let you know

16:55.222 --> 16:56.515
you're--
oh, murdering it.

16:56.681 --> 16:57.958
Well, I'm a sales juggernaut.

16:58.026 --> 17:00.102
I'm the Lance Armstrong
of this business right now.

17:00.268 --> 17:01.228
You only have one ball?

17:01.394 --> 17:02.563
And I'll have you know
something else.

17:02.631 --> 17:05.933
I already had Colleen move
the washer/dryer combo

17:06.001 --> 17:08.277
to make way
for my new deer fridge.

17:08.443 --> 17:10.003
That's important.
I want a strong wife.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.156
Hey, Alice told me to give
you guys these new leads...

17:12.321 --> 17:13.406
- Ooh.
- And supposedly

17:13.474 --> 17:15.076
they're the hot [Bleep],
so--

17:15.242 --> 17:16.327
- gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme--
- All right. Wow.

17:16.492 --> 17:17.377
Hey, it's Blake.

17:17.445 --> 17:18.612
Yeah, I talked to you earlier.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.247
Your mom grounded you
for the knife?

17:20.315 --> 17:22.450
Well, I think that's bull crap.

17:22.517 --> 17:26.127
Actually my nickname is blade.

17:26.294 --> 17:28.089
Watch and learn,
little chipmunk.

17:28.156 --> 17:29.957
'Cause I'm about

17:30.025 --> 17:31.967
to roast this nut.

17:32.133 --> 17:33.678
Hello.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.398
Yes, um,
is this Mr. Terry bollea?

17:37.466 --> 17:40.000
Oh, you've reached Terry,
brother.

17:40.068 --> 17:41.143
How you doinin' today, sir?

17:41.309 --> 17:43.170
Well, pretty good,
besides the fact

17:43.238 --> 17:45.981
that my refrigerator
just busted.

17:46.147 --> 17:49.110
Way-way, get the bell.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.346
I have an idea of how
you can get back at your mom.

17:52.414 --> 17:55.416
Do you know where
she keeps her credit cards?

17:55.484 --> 17:58.327
Good.
Get the platinum one.

17:58.493 --> 18:01.372
Basically, sir, this fridge
is as good as it's gonna get.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.832
Does it make ice cubes?

18:02.998 --> 18:03.833
Crushed and whole.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.793
Can ya keep eggs in it?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.661
Of course, eggs, meat,
anything you want.

18:07.729 --> 18:09.422
- Jell-o?
- Jell-o, yes.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.065
Here's the deal,
you're gonna give me

18:11.133 --> 18:12.675
the numbers
on that credit card,

18:12.841 --> 18:14.235
and I promise you,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.437
mama's gonna rue the day
she grounded you

18:16.505 --> 18:18.055
for bringing a knife to school.

18:18.221 --> 18:19.390
- Juice?
- Yes.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.142
- Apple juice?
- Yeah-huh.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.561
- Carrot juice?
- Oh, my God--yeah, uh-huh.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.021
What about
my different cheeses? Provolone?

18:27.522 --> 18:29.283
It's happening.
He's doing it!

18:29.351 --> 18:31.252
He's giving me
his parents' credit card number.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.987
I just sold...

18:33.153 --> 18:35.890
20 fridges! 20 fridges!
Whoo!

18:35.957 --> 18:37.458
You're goin' down, people.
It's going down, people!

18:37.526 --> 18:38.576
Whoo! Whoo!

18:38.742 --> 18:41.203
What? He got 20?

18:41.369 --> 18:42.663
Hello? Terry?
Terry?

18:42.829 --> 18:44.698
- How'd those leads work out?
- Whoo! Whoo!

18:44.766 --> 18:46.133
Brother?

18:46.201 --> 18:49.253
Ice cold.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.088
- Sales beast! Sales beast!
- Dude! How could you--

18:51.254 --> 18:53.507
- yes! Oh, this is our tv.
- Ah. Oh!

18:53.575 --> 18:55.634
Look at this,
this is a nice tv.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.136
Wow. Well,
I can't believe this,

18:57.302 --> 18:59.447
but our winner
is Blake Henderson.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.018
So yeah.
You guys lost to this guy.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.568
Congrats on the fridge.

19:12.734 --> 19:13.944
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

19:14.110 --> 19:17.164
Yeah. Hey, Naomi.
Uh--

19:17.232 --> 19:18.766
come on.

19:18.834 --> 19:21.068
So, uh...Ahem.

19:21.136 --> 19:22.453
You like refrigerators, right?

19:22.619 --> 19:23.746
- Yeah.
- Good.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.741
Because we wanted
to give this to you,

19:27.809 --> 19:28.876
as a gift.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.086
Really? Why?

19:31.252 --> 19:32.546
Let's be honest here,

19:32.614 --> 19:35.007
you've been throwin' out
crazy sex appeal all day,

19:35.173 --> 19:37.384
and we noticed that you date,
like, weirdly average dudes.

19:37.550 --> 19:38.719
Like us.

19:38.885 --> 19:40.846
And Gil.

19:41.012 --> 19:43.824
And we thought maybe you,
uh, liked one of us.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.186
So who do you choose?

19:47.352 --> 19:48.395
Choose?

19:48.561 --> 19:49.522
To be your boyfriend.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.608
Hey, gutter slut!

19:52.774 --> 19:54.568
I found this in the trash.

19:54.636 --> 19:55.769
If you didn't
want to be friends,

19:55.837 --> 19:56.862
you could've just
been honest with me.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.573
I didn't
throw that in the trash.

19:59.739 --> 20:01.442
Well, you threw one thing
in the trash,

20:01.510 --> 20:03.118
our perfect [Bleep] Future.

20:04.577 --> 20:07.815
Jill...
We don't have a future.

20:07.883 --> 20:09.617
Because I don't know you.

20:09.684 --> 20:11.544
I just met you today.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.337
And as for you guys,

20:13.503 --> 20:16.423
clearly, you're all insane!

20:16.491 --> 20:19.468
God! I hate temping.

20:24.032 --> 20:26.367
- Drama queen.
- Wow.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.310
What a bitch!

20:28.476 --> 20:30.563
- Whoo! There we go, baby!
- Come on!

20:30.729 --> 20:31.639
- Come on!
- Oh! He's about to do

20:31.706 --> 20:32.648
the five meter shuffle!

20:32.814 --> 20:35.025
- Oh! And he's pinned!
- Yep!

20:35.191 --> 20:36.777
One! Two!

20:36.845 --> 20:37.978
Oh!

20:38.046 --> 20:39.213
- Why did you do that?
- What are you doing?

20:39.281 --> 20:40.514
- Aw!
- What's wrong with you, man?

20:40.582 --> 20:42.575
Oh, my God, who cares?
Wrestling's fake.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.369
And my hate for you
is very real.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.655
Okay, you are going down,
brother!

20:47.722 --> 20:51.225
- Get him!
- Get him!

20:51.293 --> 20:52.826
Direct hit.
