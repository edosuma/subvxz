00:01.000 --> 00:03.321
(engine revs)
(tires screech)

00:07.040 --> 00:08.632
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.706
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.010 --> 00:16.343
FX presents The Americans.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.749
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:29.390 --> 00:33.156
Just remember
the lens IS right there, so...

00:33.200 --> 00:34.326
They're not gonna
search her purse?

00:34.360 --> 00:36.669
Baby, don't worry.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.327
In the next day or two,

00:38.370 --> 00:41.567
you're gonna get some
disturbing news at work.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.067
Gene Craft is dead.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.499
No, I didn't --
I didn't agree to this!

00:45.540 --> 00:48.407
Gaad: I'm in charge of
FBI counterintelligence,

00:48.440 --> 00:52.843
and my secretary
married a KGB officer.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.575
Daddy, I'm in trouble.

00:54.620 --> 00:55.541
She's in Woodley Park.
Got it.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.684
Martha, we need to go.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.688
No! If you don't walk away from
me right now --

00:59.720 --> 01:01.256
(grunts)
(gasps)

01:01.290 --> 01:05.351
If you could go back
with Martha, would you?

01:05.390 --> 01:06.891
What are you
talking about?

01:06.930 --> 01:08.192
I'd understand.

01:08.230 --> 01:10.027
Tomorrow morning,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.595
you will leave for Russia.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.937
And how soon
before you come?

01:13.970 --> 01:16.768
I won't.

01:42.430 --> 01:45.092
(watch ticking)

02:06.460 --> 02:08.314
(water shuts off)

02:15.500 --> 02:16.797
(water splashes)

02:18.300 --> 02:20.291
(sighs)

03:35.410 --> 03:36.399
(car door closes)

03:44.120 --> 03:46.611
(engine starts)

04:27.260 --> 04:29.091
(engine shuts off)

04:44.480 --> 04:47.449
(car door closes)

05:14.510 --> 05:17.001
(wind gusts)

05:35.660 --> 05:37.196
(inhales sharply)

05:41.240 --> 05:43.458
Don't be alone, Clark.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.479
All right?

05:46.510 --> 05:48.705
Don't be alone.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.369
You too.

05:55.420 --> 05:58.309
(scoffs)

05:58.350 --> 06:00.489
Oh, sure.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.249
I'll just
learn Russian and...

06:09.930 --> 06:12.023
Yeah, okay.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.032
Me too.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.711
(sniffles)

06:42.730 --> 06:46.439
(wind whistling)

07:00.080 --> 07:02.583
(engine starts)

07:40.690 --> 07:43.250
(exhales sharply)

07:43.290 --> 07:46.623
(wind whistling)

07:50.700 --> 07:53.794
**

08:29.200 --> 08:33.830
Last time, he made a whole
7-ton Learjet disappear.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.131
But that was nothing.

08:35.180 --> 08:36.841
Doesn't sound like
nothing.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.144
Mom, this is
the Statue of Liberty.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.148
Every single person I know
is gonna be watching this.

08:41.180 --> 08:45.549
Well, except probably not Dad,
because he won't be here.

08:45.590 --> 08:47.888
Won't be here for what?

08:47.920 --> 08:50.650
David Copperfield's making
the Statue of Liberty disappear

08:50.690 --> 08:52.157
on TV.

08:52.190 --> 08:54.351
Oh. Well...

08:54.400 --> 08:58.996
chances are I will be watching
it disappear with you.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.498
We just lost a big client,

09:01.540 --> 09:05.169
so I'm gonna have
a lot more time on my hands.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.735
Does this mean we're gonna
be running low on the moolah?

09:07.780 --> 09:09.668
We can eat less steak.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.541
The good news is, I won't be
spending a couple

09:11.580 --> 09:14.174
of nights away
every week anymore.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.414
You won't?

09:16.750 --> 09:18.547
Start getting used
to more Dad.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.687
Man: ...down at Union Station
yesterday.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.359
Turned out to be _some
congressman's snster.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.924
Yeah?

09:30.730 --> 09:32.391
Thanks.

09:32.430 --> 09:36.434
Woman they spotted at
the Georgia Avenue bus station?

09:36.910 --> 09:40.209
(door opens)

09:40.240 --> 09:41.537
(door closes)

09:41.580 --> 09:43.741
Team on her apartment
just turned over.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.042
No sign.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.117
Martha...and whoever's print
this is.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.539
"Clark Westerfeld."

09:50.590 --> 09:53.115
There's no match for him
in the federal database.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.754
State_and lo_cal
are still looking.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.621
(sighs)

10:00.960 --> 10:03.724
I didn't see
a Goddamn thing.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.637
Even when I took her to dinner,
when I was looking for it.

10:06.670 --> 10:07.932
She was good.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.173
All the times
she lied to my face.

10:15.510 --> 10:17.148
What it takes
to do that...

10:19.110 --> 10:21.908
Bastards must have given her
a lot of help.

10:21.950 --> 10:24.009
Oh. Sorry.

10:29.690 --> 10:33.456
(lawnmower revs)

10:37.370 --> 10:39.019
Is Paige home?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.631
Uh, no.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.279
Do you know
where she is?

10:48.310 --> 10:49.971
Church.

10:50.010 --> 10:52.979
She's doing food pantry
with Pastor Tim and Alice.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.942
Did she say anything?

10:54.980 --> 10:56.447
About?

10:56.480 --> 10:58.482
Pastor Tim and Alice.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.544
No.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.797
How did it go...
with Martha?

11:08.830 --> 11:10.866
Fine. Good.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.035
"Good"?

11:19.340 --> 11:20.807
Sorry.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.879
Um, yeah. She made it as good
as she could.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.352
What are you reading?

11:42.360 --> 11:45.329
Is it good?
Helpful?

11:45.370 --> 11:48.396
Wsumm

11:48.440 --> 11:50.658
It's helping me realize
some things.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.178
Like what?

11:53.210 --> 11:58.170
This whole winter,
I wanted to play hockey,

11:58.210 --> 12:02.909
so...I want to start
playing hockey again.

12:24.310 --> 12:28.576
(door opens, closes)

12:30.080 --> 12:31.775
(sighs)

12:36.080 --> 12:39.379
(ringing)

12:39.420 --> 12:41.388
Young-Hee: Hello?

12:41.420 --> 12:42.921
Guess who.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.222
Patty? (laughs)

12:44.260 --> 12:45.557
(laughs)
Hi.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.296
Hey!

12:47.330 --> 12:50.561
You doing anything
right now?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.397
(breathes shakily)

12:52.430 --> 12:53.795
That was really beautiful.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.239
It was pretty good.

12:55.270 --> 12:57.238
Oh, don't give me that.
I saw you crying.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.601
(laughs)
Okay, okay.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.732
It did get to me.

12:59.770 --> 13:02.079
I cry at everything.

13:02.110 --> 13:03.304
I cried at "Star Wars."

13:03.350 --> 13:05.238
When they, uh,
blew up the planet...

13:05.280 --> 13:06.918
Uh-huh
...I bawled my eyes out.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.417
(both chuckle)

13:08.450 --> 13:10.918
(scoffs)

13:10.950 --> 13:12.747
I don't see many movies.

13:12.790 --> 13:15.452
Why not?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.629
I don't know.

13:17.660 --> 13:20.754
I guess
I just always think

13:20.800 --> 13:22.927
I should be doing
something more useful.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.598
Well, you know what Mary Kay
says about that.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.268
No.
Me neither.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.097
(laughs)
But I'm (laughs)

13:29.140 --> 13:32.462
But I'm sure she said something
about it being, uh, useful

13:32.510 --> 13:34.978
to treat yourself
and relax once in a while.

13:35.010 --> 13:36.671
Relax.

13:36.710 --> 13:39.941
With our Mary Kay TimeWise
facial cleanser.
(chuckles)

13:39.980 --> 13:42.619
Scientifically formulated
for your skin type.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.618
Because _skin care
Isn't just...
Oh.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.140
...something you buy.
Something you buy.

13:46.190 --> 13:47.782
It's something you learn.
It's something you learn.

13:47.820 --> 13:48.957
(both chuckle)

13:48.990 --> 13:50.355
Let me throw this away.

13:52.390 --> 13:56.190
Hey, I have a confession
to make.
What?

13:56.230 --> 13:58.528
(sighs)
I feel really guilty

13:58.570 --> 14:01.539
for trying to turn you into
Independent Beauty Consultant

14:01.570 --> 14:02.798
so I can make
extra money.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.809
They don't take your money
out of mine.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.377
I know, but...
I don't know -- I like you,

14:08.410 --> 14:11.800
and my mother always said
don't mix money and friendship,

14:11.850 --> 14:13.647
SO...

14:13.680 --> 14:15.511
Well, you're not gonna
make too much money off of me,

14:15.550 --> 14:18.041
so our friendship
is very safe.
(laughs)

14:18.090 --> 14:20.251
Okay.

14:22.190 --> 14:24.420
Hey, look.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.857
You want to?

14:29.360 --> 14:32.193
(laughing) Okay.

14:32.230 --> 14:36.030
(Muzak playing)

14:46.210 --> 14:49.008
(birds cawing)

14:49.050 --> 14:52.110
**

15:29.760 --> 15:31.284
(knock on door)

15:35.660 --> 15:38.390
Stan: _
Saw your car pull In.

15:38.430 --> 15:39.761
Come on in.

15:41.470 --> 15:42.937
Hey, you mind
ifI grab a beer?

15:42.970 --> 15:44.938
I'm running low.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.073
Sure.
Help yourself.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.908
Oh, yeah.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.269
(bottles rattle)

15:53.320 --> 15:55.641
(sighs)

15:55.680 --> 15:57.238
(bottle cap clinks)

15:57.290 --> 15:58.939
(gulping)

16:02.620 --> 16:04.326
Ahh.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.449
Where's Elizabeth?

16:08.830 --> 16:10.923
I don't --
I don't really know.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.767
Everything okay?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.439
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, we're -- we're fine.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.006
Good.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.462
Yeah.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.775
Got a call
from my lawyer.

16:21.810 --> 16:24.472
He's getting the divorce papers
ready to send, so...

16:24.510 --> 16:26.273
(sighs)

16:26.310 --> 16:28.449
Not like
it's big news.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.516
Right.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.681
(sighs)

16:36.720 --> 16:40.349
Nothing else.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.027
(sighs)

16:42.060 --> 16:46.121
Stan, you got your son back,
you got your house,

16:46.170 --> 16:49.469
your stuff --
You still dating Tori?

16:49.500 --> 16:52.503
Off and on.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.030
More off.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.833
Fine. Whatever.
You'll be fine.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.701
And if it's not Tori,
it'll be somebody else,

16:59.750 --> 17:02.310
and that'll happen
sooner that you think.

17:02.350 --> 17:04.511
Maybe.

17:04.550 --> 17:07.678
I don't know.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.688
(sighs)

17:10.860 --> 17:12.179
I'm sorry.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.697
I hav_-- I haven't been
getting much sleep.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.197
(chuckles)

17:15.230 --> 17:17.164
I'm feeling kind of...

17:17.200 --> 17:20.363
We're in the middle of dealing
with this disaster at work

17:20.400 --> 17:21.833
the last three days.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.236
If it turns out

17:24.270 --> 17:26.158
_how it looks like
It's turning out...

17:26.210 --> 17:28.337
(door opens)

17:28.380 --> 17:30.075
...won't be
enough beer in the world.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.340
(door closes)

17:32.380 --> 17:34.541
(footsteps approach)

17:34.580 --> 17:35.672
Stan!

17:35.720 --> 17:38.018
Mm.
Hi, Elizabeth.

17:38.050 --> 17:40.086
Hi.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.008
Do you want
to stay for dinner?

17:42.060 --> 17:43.857
Oh.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.050
Uh...

17:46.560 --> 17:49.028
No.

17:49.060 --> 17:51.460
No, I should leave you guys
to your night.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.392
Thanks for the beer.
Yeah.

17:56.940 --> 18:00.103
Uh, good night.
Good night.

18:00.140 --> 18:04.372
(door opens, closes)

18:04.410 --> 18:07.072
What was that
all about?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.044
Nothing. He was, uh --
he was just running low on beer.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.084
Where are the kids?

18:14.120 --> 18:16.111
Uh, still out.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.128
Did you eat?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.957
Uh, no.
You?

18:19.990 --> 18:22.959
I snacked
with Young-Hee.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.127
How's that going?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.934
It's going.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.137
I'll make you something.
How about eggs?

18:35.780 --> 18:37.441
Let's see
what else we have.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.170
(sighs)

18:45.520 --> 18:47.659
Turns out
they were on her.

18:49.490 --> 18:52.288
Stan just told me they
were in the middle
of a disaster at work.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.951
I'd been worried
I pulled her for nothing.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.297
Well, you were right.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.796
She had to get out.

19:06.970 --> 19:08.972
She'll be okay.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.016
She was a nice woman.

19:14.050 --> 19:18.441
She was straight-ahead,
uncomplicated.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.355
Simple.
She was...

19:22.490 --> 19:24.151
She wasn't simple.

19:25.890 --> 19:29.621
I don't mean "simple."
I meant...easy.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.799
You know...to talk to.

19:31.830 --> 19:35.368
You could probably
talk to her

19:35.400 --> 19:38.335
about those things
that you've been talking about.

19:38.370 --> 19:41.999
She was actually
very complicated.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.978
Of course.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.513
People
underestimated her.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.647
Apparently.
(door opens)

19:50.690 --> 19:53.557
Henry: Hey, Mom. Can we have
sloppy joes for dinner?

19:53.590 --> 19:56.684
(door closes)
Yes! That sounds like
a great Idea.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.824
Hey, Dad.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.420
(footsteps approach, recede)

20:07.100 --> 20:12.003
* Yesterday
she gave me her love *

20:12.040 --> 20:17.034
* And my only hope

20:20.210 --> 20:22.349
Kimmy.

20:22.380 --> 20:23.586
Good.

20:23.620 --> 20:25.713
It's making a difference
in the field.

20:27.050 --> 20:30.349
Speaking of which,
I have news.

20:30.390 --> 20:34.121
Your son finished his tour.
He's back home, safe.

20:36.130 --> 20:37.529
Who knows?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.561
Maybe what you've
been getting from Breland

20:39.600 --> 20:41.397
helped him survive.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.434
Does he have anybody?

20:47.480 --> 20:51.405
Irina's father in Moscow.

20:53.110 --> 20:55.146
(sighs)

20:58.450 --> 21:00.088
Any news on Martha?

21:00.120 --> 21:02.259
No.

21:02.290 --> 21:06.727
I want someone to contact
her parents soon.

21:06.760 --> 21:11.129
I'll have the Centre call them
when they think it's safe.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.899
When's that?

21:12.930 --> 21:14.761
Six months, maybe.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.438
They'll think she's dead.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.074
W-- (sighs)

21:21.110 --> 21:23.772
Philip, there are procedures
in place for this.

21:23.810 --> 21:28.110
It's not perfect.
It's a hard situation.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.284
Thank you.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.826
All right.

21:40.860 --> 21:44.796
Maybe you can
call them yourself.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.434
I want to tell them they'll
be able to see her again --

21:51.470 --> 21:53.108
maybe not
for three or four years,

21:53.140 --> 21:55.279
and maybe not in the location
where she is now.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.449
You know
that won't be possible.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.005
Things can be arranged,
Gabriel.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.642
If we want to do it,
we can do it.

22:01.680 --> 22:02.977
Come on.

22:03.020 --> 22:06.342
Philip, you cannot do this one
on your own.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.688
And I don't see
the Centre agreeing.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.827
I'm sorry.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.630
Every one of you here
has the opportunity

22:21.670 --> 22:23.297
to live an authentic life.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.332
(chalk tapping)

22:26.370 --> 22:29.976
But so far,
it just ain't happening, is it?

22:30.010 --> 22:33.719
Why?
Why is that?

22:33.750 --> 22:35.809
Because you're trapped,
right?

22:35.850 --> 22:38.148
Isn't that why?

22:38.190 --> 22:42.650
Yeah, sure.
That's how you feel.

22:42.690 --> 22:46.387
Stuck in a box
that you can't get out of.

22:47.860 --> 22:51.569
Well, who made the box?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.838
You all think
you want to be free.

22:55.870 --> 22:59.362
Everything would be great,
if only you didn't have

22:59.410 --> 23:03.699
this shit that you got
to take care of,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.900
this crap
that you got to worry about.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.917
Well, I've got news for you.

23:13.890 --> 23:17.018
You love your prison.

23:17.060 --> 23:22.623
You love the prison
you've made for yourself.

23:24.230 --> 23:30.237
If somebody came along
and broke the lock right now,

23:30.270 --> 23:34.707
you wouldn't know what the hell
to do with yourself --

23:34.740 --> 23:37.106
wouldn't have a clue.

23:46.420 --> 23:47.580
(knock on door)

23:47.620 --> 23:49.258
(sighs)

25:12.040 --> 25:13.359
(door opens)

25:13.410 --> 25:14.570
(keys rattle)

25:19.080 --> 25:20.479
Are the kids home?

25:20.510 --> 25:23.479
Uh, Henry, uh --
Henry's across the street.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.216
I think he and Matthew
are InventIng some game.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.013
And Paige
is at Bible study.

25:29.590 --> 25:30.852
I went to EST.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.759
(sighs)

25:42.240 --> 25:45.209
What, uh --
What made you do that?

25:47.610 --> 25:49.703
Told you I was gonna go.

25:52.210 --> 25:53.404
So?

25:53.450 --> 25:56.214
So...

25:57.750 --> 25:59.388
I see why you like it.

25:59.420 --> 26:01.684
You do?

26:01.720 --> 26:05.087
Yeah.

26:05.130 --> 26:08.691
Things that are hard
to talk about...

26:08.730 --> 26:11.198
that hurt too much --

26:11.230 --> 26:16.930
Maybe it's good that someone
makes you look at those things.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.532
Yeah.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.538
I-I mean, it is weird

26:21.580 --> 26:23.536
talking
in front of strangers, but...

26:23.580 --> 26:25.377
But they don't let you
just stand there

26:25.410 --> 26:27.207
and say
anything you want.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.377
You know,
they question it.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.115
Make you question it.

26:31.150 --> 26:34.051
Yeah. Right.
They keep you honest.

26:34.090 --> 26:38.424
It helps.
I can -- I can see that.

26:42.430 --> 26:43.658
But?

26:48.770 --> 26:51.807
They just try so hard to get you
to sign up for more.

26:51.840 --> 26:55.401
You know, spend more money
and bring in your friends and...

26:55.440 --> 26:56.634
That's not the point.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.568
Well,
I think that is the point.

26:58.610 --> 27:02.239
They manipulate you
to get at your wallet.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.111
You think
I'm being manipulated.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.451
I just think it's...

27:10.490 --> 27:12.958
it's very American,
the whole thing.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.589
You don't get it.

27:16.630 --> 27:19.428
That's what they say when
you don't go along with it --

27:19.470 --> 27:20.835
"You don't get it."

27:20.870 --> 27:22.599
So you do sign up
for more seminars,

27:22.640 --> 27:24.437
you spend more money,

27:24.470 --> 27:26.802
and then suddenly
you get it.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.139
I'm get a lot out of it,
and that's what matters.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.648
But are you?
Getting a lot?

27:32.680 --> 27:35.012
Because,
from what I can see,

27:35.050 --> 27:37.268
you're not sleeping,
you're not eating.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.481
Yeah, and there's a reason
for that.

27:40.550 --> 27:41.778
Because you put Martha
on a plane?

27:41.820 --> 27:42.809
Is that it?

27:44.990 --> 27:46.321
Isn't that enough?

27:46.360 --> 27:50.296
It happens, Philip.
We lose agents.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.491
Agents?

27:52.530 --> 27:55.294
Yes -- agents.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.296
That is what she was.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.535
She was a human being.

27:59.570 --> 28:01.834
At least she's alive.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.341
You didn't have to send her
out onto the street

28:05.380 --> 28:06.540
to get mowed down.

28:06.580 --> 28:10.141
You want
to talk about Gregory now?

28:10.180 --> 28:13.013
I have not said a word about
Gregory all this time.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.711
But you still think about him,
apparently.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.716
Of course
I still think about him!

28:16.760 --> 28:19.479
Well, I'm sorry the
man you loved died and
you're stuck with me!

28:19.530 --> 28:22.397
I am stuck with you
because I took you back

28:22.430 --> 28:24.864
after you slept with the woman
who had your son...
(telephone rings)

28:24.900 --> 28:27.027
...and you lied to my face
about it!

28:28.700 --> 28:31.203
(ringing continues)

28:37.210 --> 28:38.768
Hello.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.944
(door closes)

28:45.390 --> 28:46.880
Martha's in Cuba.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.457
She'll be in Prague
by morning.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.251
Got a signal from Lisa.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.723
She wants to talk earlier
than our normal meetIng.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.192
Any idea?

28:59.230 --> 29:00.959
No.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.369
All right.
What's going on with you two?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.115
You both look terrible.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.084
Is it about Martha?

29:19.650 --> 29:22.414
Is someone
gOIng to tell me?

29:30.930 --> 29:33.899
Fine.
I'll tell him.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.067
I've been going to EST.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.102
EST?

29:38.140 --> 29:40.904
Yeah.
It's a type of seminar.

29:40.940 --> 29:44.899
I know what EST is.
The question is why?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.770
(Philip scoffs)

29:46.810 --> 29:49.313
Are you really
asking me that?

29:49.350 --> 29:51.489
Yes,
I'm really asking you that.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.442
Maybe because
you don't live my life.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.583
Well, I've lived close enough,
thank you.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.929
He doesn't want to hear it
from you, GabrIel, or me.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.418
Apparently he needs a group
of strangers in some hotel room

30:01.460 --> 30:02.620
to listen to him.

30:02.660 --> 30:04.867
(sighs)

30:16.310 --> 30:18.972
(door opens)

30:19.010 --> 30:20.978
(door closes)

30:23.150 --> 30:24.617
Do you want
to talk about it?

30:24.650 --> 30:26.811
Not really.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.782
I'm tired.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.822
I'm going to go home,
take my antibiotic,

30:34.860 --> 30:37.863
and then I'm going
to take a nap.

30:41.570 --> 30:44.801
(door opens)
(SIghs)

30:44.840 --> 30:46.364
(door closes)

30:55.380 --> 30:57.519
(door opens, keys rattle)

30:59.850 --> 31:01.818
Hi.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.488
I th-- I thought
you were at church.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.827
Isn't today Bible study?

31:05.860 --> 31:09.023
I decided to skip it.

31:10.700 --> 31:11.894
Why?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.565
Ijust...

31:19.440 --> 31:22.329
Henry is getting some extra help
on his Spanish.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.848
He won't be back
until 6:00, so...

31:24.880 --> 31:26.905
(sighs)

31:28.880 --> 31:31.678
I'm just...

31:31.720 --> 31:34.382
I went last week
and the week before.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.028
You have to go every week,
Paige,

31:38.060 --> 31:40.028
if you're going to stay close
to Pastor Tim.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.392
Mom, it's fine
if I skip a week.

31:46.230 --> 31:49.529
I can see why
it might look that way to you,

31:49.570 --> 31:54.473
but you need to maintain a
consistent presence in his life.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.107
When you go to Bible study,
you have to talk and be into it,

31:59.150 --> 32:02.119
so if I'm not in the mood,
it's gonna be obvious.

32:05.250 --> 32:06.945
Well, then you get yourself
in the mood.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.628
(sighs)

32:16.600 --> 32:19.262
(sternly)
Get back in here right now.

32:24.170 --> 32:27.901
We've been trying, Paige --
trying to be nice to you,

32:27.940 --> 32:29.805
trying to forgive you
for what you did.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.741
But if you think
for a minute

32:32.780 --> 32:34.975
you can be precious
about your moods

32:35.020 --> 32:37.113
when it comes
to Pastor Tim and his wife --

32:37.150 --> 32:40.244
I can't control
how I feel!

32:40.290 --> 32:43.111
You can control
what you do.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.788
And from now on,
you are going to.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.322
And let me be clear about
what you are gomg to do.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.591
You are going to go
to Bible study every week.

32:52.630 --> 32:56.259
You are going to go
to Sunday services every week.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.098
You are going to find
some other shit to volunteer for

32:59.140 --> 33:02.439
at that Goddamn church
so that not a day goes by

33:02.480 --> 33:05.278
without you seeing
Pastor Tim and his wife.

33:05.310 --> 33:07.676
And then you are going
to come home every night,

33:07.710 --> 33:10.110
and you're gonna tell
me and your father

33:10.150 --> 33:12.812
everything that happened --
what was said, their moods,

33:12.850 --> 33:14.681
their attitudes,
their feelings --

33:14.720 --> 33:17.609
because that_ is
what Is Important rIght now.

33:17.660 --> 33:20.322
Because,
thanks to what you did,

33:20.360 --> 33:23.295
that is all
that stands between us

33:23.330 --> 33:26.697
and this family
being destroyed.

33:51.260 --> 33:53.251
(machine beeps)

33:57.700 --> 34:00.021
They asked me to come up
and see the Director.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.362
Well,
that could be anything.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.337
I'm pretty sure
they're not calling me up

34:07.370 --> 34:09.270
for a commendation, Stan.

34:11.040 --> 34:14.510
I knew a guy who got called up
to see the Director.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.415
He was sure
that was the end.

34:16.450 --> 34:18.509
Gets up there,
waits two hours,

34:18.550 --> 34:21.087
turns out_ the Director
had some VISItIng dIgnItary

34:21.120 --> 34:22.849
who's a stamp collector.

34:22.890 --> 34:26.223
Director's office had heard my
friend's a stamp collector, too,

34:26.260 --> 34:28.558
SO...

34:28.600 --> 34:32.366
they called him up there
to talk to the guy.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.698
(elevator bell dings)

34:34.740 --> 34:37.038
Well...
(elevator doors open)

34:37.070 --> 34:39.061
...I don't collect stamps.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.605
(doors close)

34:48.620 --> 34:51.214
(refrigerator door closes)

34:51.250 --> 34:52.547
They're children.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.559
They don't have
our life experience yet.

34:55.590 --> 34:56.887
Oh, please.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.424
Bringing their marital spats
to the job,

35:00.460 --> 35:01.597
going to EST.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.092
They say goodbye
to an agent,

35:05.130 --> 35:06.961
and they think
it's the end of the world.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.059
Gabriel,
we can't expect them to --

35:09.100 --> 35:11.637
Claudia, in my time,

35:11.670 --> 35:14.309
there were things worse
than the war.

35:14.340 --> 35:18.572
I had a friend -- Gakov,
a decorated officer.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.077
We were close
smce school.

35:20.110 --> 35:21.975
Then he became
an "enemy of the people."

35:22.020 --> 35:24.284
I had to go to his house
and pull him out

35:24.320 --> 35:28.586
in front of his wife, his son,
and his two daughters.

35:28.620 --> 35:29.780
The wife was screaming.

35:29.820 --> 35:32.482
The children
were screamIng.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.498
"Not you, comrade,"
he said.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.418
They pushed him
into a car.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.098
We did what we had to do.

35:38.130 --> 35:39.791
That's the way it was

35:39.830 --> 35:41.639
or we got killed
ourselves.

35:41.670 --> 35:43.968
They think this is so bad,
what they're going through?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.103
They have no idea.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.437
You're angry. You --

35:46.470 --> 35:49.007
Yes, I'm angry,
and I'm frustrated.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.507
I'm losing my influence
with them.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.939
They're not
listening to me.

35:51.980 --> 35:55.939
Oh, your officers
aren't listening to you.

35:55.980 --> 35:58.141
Boohoo.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.279
It's never been this bad.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.184
It's worse every day.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.798
Things have gone to shit,
and you think,

36:09.830 --> 36:12.367
"Well, it's not their fault,"
so it has to be yours.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.822
Well, whose fault is it?

36:13.870 --> 36:15.497
It's the world.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.468
You don't have the answer.
I don't, either.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.378
Do you think there's someone
waiting in the wings who does?

36:23.410 --> 36:26.402
(sighs)

36:33.090 --> 36:35.308
Everything okay?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.009
No.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.358
It's not.

36:43.900 --> 36:48.564
Maurice
is back on the bottle.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.760
So am I.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.701
Lisa...

36:54.040 --> 36:56.235
He took our money.

36:56.280 --> 37:01.411
All that money that's been
coming in from you and Jack --

37:01.450 --> 37:03.873
he took it,
ran off to Florida

37:03.920 --> 37:05.717
with some woman
he met a month ago.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.512
Let's get to a meeting
right now.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.688
I need
to make things right.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.550
You will -- we will.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.397
I'm gonna take you.
Let's go.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.431
I sent my kids
to my sister's.

37:22.470 --> 37:25.564
I cannot
put them through this.

37:25.610 --> 37:28.272
I've been living a lie.

37:29.610 --> 37:32.249
I need to make things right,
and you do, too.

37:34.150 --> 37:38.541
We need to tell the police
about Jack,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.148
about
what we've been doing.

37:43.090 --> 37:44.626
We can't do that.

37:44.660 --> 37:47.288
We have to.

37:47.330 --> 37:48.592
'Cause I started slipping

37:48.630 --> 37:52.225
the moment I started
takIng that money.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.592
The lying,
the pressure --

37:55.640 --> 37:58.564
it was too much.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.737
I cracked.

38:00.770 --> 38:02.237
(sobs)

38:02.280 --> 38:04.271
And you will, too,

38:04.310 --> 38:06.744
if you don't come clean,
'Chelle.

38:06.780 --> 38:09.943
Lisa,
I'm not gonna crack.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.312
Yeah, well...
(plastic bags crinkle)

38:12.350 --> 38:15.080
that's what I told myself,
and then just...

38:15.120 --> 38:17.259
(sniffles)

38:17.290 --> 38:18.826
...sneaks up on you.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.259
I'll talk to Jack,
okay?

38:25.300 --> 38:27.268
You don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.597
Jack will
tell us anything.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.766
He probably got
all sorts of women

38:29.800 --> 38:31.336
doing all sorts of shit.

38:31.370 --> 38:32.962
You need to get rid
of that asshole.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.001
Lisa --
'Chelle, please!

38:36.810 --> 38:38.869
Please help me.
(breathes shakily)

38:41.550 --> 38:43.848
I can't go in there
by myself.

38:45.550 --> 38:49.486
If we go in there together,
they will give us immunity.

38:49.520 --> 38:52.284
Do you really think they're
gonna give you immunity?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.184
If we go in there
together...

38:55.500 --> 38:57.320
They'll take your kids.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.464
I know you feel bad
right now,

39:02.500 --> 39:04.036
but you don't have
to do this.

39:04.070 --> 39:06.209
Okay?

39:06.240 --> 39:09.038
L-Let's just get to a meeting.
Let's do that.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.547
I'll do it by myself,
then.

39:14.550 --> 39:16.017
They don't want
to make a deal,

39:16.050 --> 39:18.518
they won't get to hear
what I have to say.

39:22.390 --> 39:25.359
They won't
take my kids from me.

39:26.930 --> 39:31.594
Put me on probation?
That's fine.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.389
(grunts)

39:33.430 --> 39:34.658
(glass shatters)

39:34.700 --> 39:37.191
(breathing heavily)

39:41.580 --> 39:44.879
(groans)

39:44.910 --> 39:48.710
**

40:05.230 --> 40:07.698
Gabriel: Want a game?

40:07.730 --> 40:09.197
I don't think so.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.060
Tea?

40:13.470 --> 40:14.903
No.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.104
(door opens)

40:26.920 --> 40:28.751
Lisa's done, too.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.083
(purse thuds)

40:57.650 --> 40:59.413
Put down my cigarettes?

40:59.450 --> 41:00.747
Yea_h.
I-I put It out.

41:00.790 --> 41:01.779
Sit down.

41:06.860 --> 41:09.420
(Elizabeth winces)

41:09.460 --> 41:11.098
Mm.

41:11.130 --> 41:12.791
Sorry.

41:16.340 --> 41:19.138
**

41:25.980 --> 41:28.141
(sighs)

41:31.990 --> 41:33.878
Things have to change.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.026
I'm going to talk
to the Centre.

41:48.070 --> 41:51.528
I'm going to tell them that
it's time we ease up on you two.

41:51.570 --> 41:54.630
It's been too much --
too much for anyone.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.638
No new operations.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.071
Maintain the Breland bug
and, uh, Young-Hee.

42:04.180 --> 42:07.889
This will be the closest you two
have ever come to a vacation.

42:10.890 --> 42:14.053
(exhales sharply)

42:14.090 --> 42:15.352
For how long?

42:15.400 --> 42:17.755
Take as long as you need.

42:20.030 --> 42:22.191
And you think the Centre
will agree to that?

42:23.370 --> 42:25.031
I'll make sure they do.

42:25.070 --> 42:27.766
**

42:46.960 --> 42:48.552
(sighs)

42:52.070 --> 42:54.391
So, I guess we're gonna
be travel agents now.

43:09.080 --> 43:10.741
You know
what we should do?

43:10.780 --> 43:12.816
What?

43:14.490 --> 43:16.583
Take the kids to Epcot.

43:22.260 --> 43:24.558
(heroic music playing
on television)

43:24.600 --> 43:27.569
Henry: Mom, Dad, come on.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.431
He's about to do it.

43:36.110 --> 43:38.601
(music continues)

43:54.360 --> 43:55.827
(people gasping)

43:56.960 --> 43:58.154
Whoa.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.259
Woman:
I can't believe this.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.291
(indistinct chatter,
people cheering)

44:04.340 --> 44:06.467
Man: _
Ground control, send In copter.

44:06.510 --> 44:07.602
(speaks indistinctly)

44:07.640 --> 44:11.508
(cheers and applause)

44:11.540 --> 44:14.043
(music continues)

44:17.820 --> 44:19.685
Copperfield: My mother
was the first one to tell me

44:19.720 --> 44:21.278
about the Statue of Liberty.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.481
She saw it first
from the deck of a ship

44:23.520 --> 44:25.454
that brought her to America.

44:25.490 --> 44:26.479
She was an immigrant.

44:28.190 --> 44:30.021
how precious our liberty is

44:30.060 --> 44:31.869
and how easily it can be lost.

44:31.900 --> 44:35.358
And then, one day,
it occurred to me

44:35.400 --> 44:37.368
that I could show with magic

44:37.400 --> 44:39.459
how we take our freedom
for granted.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.330
Sometimes we don't realize

44:41.370 --> 44:43.304
how important something is
until it's gone,

44:43.340 --> 44:46.798
so I asked our government
for permission

44:46.850 --> 44:49.318
to let me make the
Statue of Liberty disappear,

44:49.350 --> 44:51.375
just for a few minutes.

44:51.420 --> 44:52.887
(upbeat music plays)

44:52.920 --> 44:54.512
How long can we stay free?

44:54.550 --> 44:58.828
For just as long as we keep
thinking and speaking

44:58.860 --> 45:00.487
and acting
as free human beings.

45:00.530 --> 45:02.191
Our ancestors couldn't.

45:02.230 --> 45:04.391
We can.

45:04.430 --> 45:05.727
And our children will.

45:08.870 --> 45:10.030
Now!

45:11.600 --> 45:12.862
(people gasp)

45:12.910 --> 45:14.502
Whoa.
(applause)

45:14.540 --> 45:17.407
How did he do that?
I have no idea.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.203
(cheers and applause)

45:32.060 --> 45:35.928
* Think I'll walk out
In the ram *

45:36.560 --> 45:38.357
Oh, yes!
Oh, my gosh!

45:38.400 --> 45:45.033
* Called you
time and time aga-a-a-in *

45:45.070 --> 45:48.904
* Got no reply

45:48.940 --> 45:51.704
* You've gone
reached the point of no return *

45:51.740 --> 45:54.106
Tied up, though.
The shot!

45:54.150 --> 45:55.048
Ohh!

45:55.080 --> 45:56.274
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

45:56.320 --> 45:57.378
(door closes)
Thanks for coming.

45:57.420 --> 45:58.910
Of course.

45:58.950 --> 46:00.713
So,
you guys are leaving when?

46:00.750 --> 46:01.956
Fnday.

46:01.990 --> 46:03.617
Straight to Hong Kong?

46:03.660 --> 46:06.549
Hong Kong to Bangkok,
and then we head, uh, north --

46:06.590 --> 46:10.549
Chiang Mai, stay with
Linh's family for three weeks.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.068
Her family is,
uh, in Thailand?

46:13.100 --> 46:15.261
That's where they landed
after the war.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.906
So, tell me.

46:18.940 --> 46:20.498
How's the new guy?

46:22.940 --> 46:24.578
Typical Webster munchkin.

46:24.610 --> 46:26.077
(chuckles)

46:26.110 --> 46:27.475
Big
on the shoe shines?

46:27.510 --> 46:28.647
Shoe shines, haircuts...

46:28.680 --> 46:30.409
(bottles clink)

46:30.450 --> 46:31.940
You can tie your tie
any way you want,

46:31.990 --> 46:33.287
as long as
it's a half-Windsor.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.742
(bottle cap clinks)
Hm.

46:34.790 --> 46:36.655
He's doubling
the tech sweeps.

46:36.690 --> 46:39.579
No more personal clocks,
radios.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.427
Pens?

46:41.460 --> 46:43.257
You'd think so,
wouldn't you?

46:43.300 --> 46:44.494
(chuckles)

46:44.530 --> 46:46.418
Have a seat.
Take a load off.

46:46.470 --> 46:50.133
* Done my share of winning

46:52.340 --> 46:54.501
* Now my turn to lose

46:54.540 --> 46:56.804
You're gonna
have to work on that.

46:58.480 --> 47:02.143
* After a fair beginning

47:03.850 --> 47:05.943
* The game's up

47:05.990 --> 47:09.289
* I'm through

47:09.320 --> 47:11.288
(inhales deeply)

47:11.320 --> 47:13.185
None of my business
anymore,

47:13.230 --> 47:15.619
but, uh...

47:15.660 --> 47:20.495
I can't stop thinking
about you and Burov.

47:20.530 --> 47:22.134
Maybe he can't be turned,
of course,

47:22.170 --> 47:24.695
or -- or maybe you've turned him
already,

47:24.740 --> 47:29.302
but my instinct tells me
you haven't.

47:29.340 --> 47:32.138
(indistinct sports chatter
on television)

47:32.180 --> 47:35.149
It's your operation,
Stan.

47:35.180 --> 47:36.977
(volume decreases)

47:37.020 --> 47:39.887
And screw the Deputy AG.
and screw your new boss

47:39.920 --> 47:42.855
_ and screw the Director
If they're pressurIng you...

47:44.360 --> 47:49.650
...but it might be that
you're holding off with Burov

47:49.700 --> 47:52.726
because your conscience
is bothering you,

47:52.770 --> 47:55.034
because of what happened
to Nina.

47:55.070 --> 47:56.537
**

47:56.570 --> 48:00.108
* Think I'll walk out
In the storm *

48:02.880 --> 48:09.069
* There's no_ love_
to keep me warm lnSI-l-l-de *

48:09.120 --> 48:10.371
Five minutes.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.342
* Hope it's fine

48:12.390 --> 48:14.187
Things get personal.
You're not the first.

48:14.220 --> 48:17.189
You -- You feel bad about Nina.
Burov does, too.

48:17.220 --> 48:19.029
(inhales deeply)

48:19.060 --> 48:21.551
You've got his brother
and you've got her,

48:21.590 --> 48:24.195
and that's your plan.

48:24.230 --> 48:28.189
And then your conscience
POPS UP,

48:28.230 --> 48:31.768
because it starts to get
a little bit too much.

48:33.140 --> 48:37.702
Now, I'm gonna sound
like Webster here --

48:37.740 --> 48:42.040
and I would rather cut
my own throat than do that --

48:42.080 --> 48:45.049
but you talk about
things getting personal...

48:45.090 --> 48:50.084
* At the end of the line

48:50.120 --> 48:51.451
Paige?

48:52.830 --> 48:54.149
(sighs)

48:55.260 --> 48:57.251
Everything okay?
