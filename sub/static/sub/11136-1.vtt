01:33.738 --> 01:35.706
He'd go to hell, right?

01:35.740 --> 01:37.571
They walked across the sands...

01:37.609 --> 01:39.440
and they knew they were sinners.

01:39.477 --> 01:42.173
They knew that they didn't know
the word of the book...

01:42.214 --> 01:44.239
that told them
how they should behave...

05:45.190 --> 05:51.151
You're eatin' out
my heart and soul, babe

05:51.196 --> 05:56.031
You're feasting on
my better side

05:57.535 --> 06:05.135
Who ever thought
you'd be this way, girl

06:05.176 --> 06:07.076
Who's this?

06:07.111 --> 06:08.135
Open Granny's room.

06:08.179 --> 06:09.874
Granny's room? What...

06:09.914 --> 06:11.882
What did you go and do, Vincent?

06:11.916 --> 06:13.747
Get the key, damn it!

06:34.973 --> 06:36.099
Ida, come in here.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.700
I'm hungry, Vincent.
What do you want?

06:38.743 --> 06:40.506
The good Lord has chosen...

06:40.545 --> 06:43.514
to pluck this flower away
from the Grim Reaper.

06:43.548 --> 06:45.243
And I want to make
good and sure...

06:45.283 --> 06:47.274
he keeps his hands off her.

06:47.318 --> 06:50.446
- I need your help.
- Why?

06:50.488 --> 06:53.355
Oh, oh, oh. I see. All right.

06:53.391 --> 06:55.120
Well, let's have a look at it.

07:04.135 --> 07:06.330
Oh, well, she'll live.

07:06.371 --> 07:08.669
All right, well, I'll fix
your little flower for you...

07:08.706 --> 07:10.674
but first you got
to go out and pick me...

07:10.708 --> 07:14.007
some goldenseal, comfrey,
valerian, and plantain.

07:14.045 --> 07:15.205
All right.

07:49.747 --> 07:51.874
I must confess
I was skeptical...

07:51.916 --> 07:54.009
but everything I heard is true.

07:54.052 --> 07:55.815
Your smoked meats
are superior...

07:55.853 --> 07:59.653
to any I've tasted.
Girls, go play outside!

07:59.691 --> 08:03.320
We'd like to continue to
enjoy your meat, Mr. Smith.

08:03.361 --> 08:05.192
Where could we purchase some?

08:05.229 --> 08:07.459
Well, look no further, folks.

08:07.498 --> 08:09.659
If you'll just step
right over here.

08:12.036 --> 08:13.901
Here, try one of these.

08:19.043 --> 08:23.844
Now, this is our
souvenir sampler box.

08:23.881 --> 08:25.781
No chemicals or preservatives...

08:25.817 --> 08:29.776
just 100% honest-to-goodness
hickory smoked meat.

08:29.821 --> 08:32.847
And you get all this
for just $2.95.

08:36.227 --> 08:38.354
What's in there?

08:38.395 --> 08:40.956
- I dare you to look.
- Darers go first.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.091
OK, chicken.

09:48.066 --> 09:50.193
A little souvenir
for your station wagon.

09:50.234 --> 09:51.201
Oh, how nice!

09:51.235 --> 09:52.259
Thank you, sir.

09:54.772 --> 09:56.171
Good gracious!

09:56.207 --> 09:59.506
I've never seen them
act like that before.

09:59.544 --> 10:01.535
What is it? Children?

10:04.916 --> 10:06.247
How peculiar.

10:06.284 --> 10:08.616
I'll calm them down for you.

10:17.795 --> 10:20.195
You folks come back
and see us again real soon.

10:20.231 --> 10:21.892
It was a pleasure.

12:04.802 --> 12:06.292
Hello?

12:13.311 --> 12:14.642
Anybody home?

12:49.113 --> 12:50.910
Guess who?

12:50.948 --> 12:52.813
Ida, let me go.

12:52.850 --> 12:55.683
Ida! Ida! Let Bruce go.

13:12.236 --> 13:15.364
Ida, get a bathrobe
for Terry, please.

13:15.406 --> 13:17.499
Well, I hope
you're feeling better.

13:17.541 --> 13:19.008
I want to see Bo.

13:19.043 --> 13:21.238
Where is he?

13:21.279 --> 13:24.874
Ah, he passed away this morning.

13:25.983 --> 13:27.848
You mean he's dead?

13:30.187 --> 13:32.246
I don't believe it.

13:33.758 --> 13:35.191
I want to see him.

13:35.226 --> 13:38.491
Well, it's too late.
I buried him at sunrise.

13:38.529 --> 13:41.623
Oh, oh...

13:48.773 --> 13:51.037
Please tell me it isn't true!

13:51.075 --> 13:55.603
Calm down, ma'am.
Everything's gonna be OK.

13:55.646 --> 13:56.635
Here.

13:57.648 --> 13:59.309
Come on. Come on.

14:00.451 --> 14:01.611
That's right.

14:02.887 --> 14:05.617
What the heck's
going on here, Vince?

14:05.656 --> 14:11.026
Terry, this is my kid brother,
Sheriff Smith of Grainville.

14:11.062 --> 14:14.691
See, I was out hunting
very early this morning...

14:14.732 --> 14:17.223
and I heard this crash...

14:17.268 --> 14:19.600
and then I found her
by the side of the road.

14:19.637 --> 14:20.899
Oh, oh, here.

14:21.973 --> 14:25.170
I guess the motorcycle
went out of control...

14:25.209 --> 14:29.873
and he gave up the ghost
just before dawn.

14:29.914 --> 14:31.905
Boris Tulinski.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.476
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

14:35.519 --> 14:37.180
Were you married?

14:42.626 --> 14:45.254
Who gave you permission
to bury him?

14:49.367 --> 14:51.062
Uh, ma'am, in this county...

14:51.102 --> 14:55.903
under extenuating
circumstances, it's OK.

15:00.911 --> 15:02.401
Where did you bury him?

15:02.446 --> 15:03.708
In the cemetery.

15:26.404 --> 15:28.235
Why the hell didn't you
call me about this?

15:28.272 --> 15:30.706
I figured you had enough
to take care of already.

15:30.741 --> 15:33.505
Besides, it wasn't much you
could do about it at that point.

15:33.544 --> 15:36.308
I mean, the body wasn't...
wasn't intact.

15:36.347 --> 15:39.180
I did the coroner
one hell of a favor.

15:40.117 --> 15:42.585
She wouldn't want to
remember him like that.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.986
Believe me, it's for the best.

15:45.022 --> 15:47.490
What's she gonna do now?

15:47.525 --> 15:51.120
Oh, rest a while, I expect.

15:51.162 --> 15:52.356
If she's any trouble for you...

15:52.396 --> 15:55.297
I could put her up with
one of the county agencies.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.157
Trouble?

15:58.202 --> 15:59.999
Well, were not exactly
hurting...

16:00.037 --> 16:01.971
for accommodations around here.

16:02.006 --> 16:03.997
Besides, we could use
a little help.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.771
A smart girl like that
would come in right handy, too.

16:09.513 --> 16:13.005
Sooey, sooey, sooey!

16:13.050 --> 16:15.712
Sooey. Soo-soo!

16:17.088 --> 16:18.146
Sooey!

16:29.066 --> 16:30.931
Hello, Bob. What a surprise.

16:30.968 --> 16:33.436
I wasn't expecting you
for another month.

16:33.471 --> 16:37.032
Well, this is what we call
a little spot check, Vincent.

16:37.074 --> 16:38.871
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

16:38.909 --> 16:41.503
Oh, hell, it's no
inconvenience at all.

16:41.545 --> 16:43.740
It's always my pleasure
to see you, Bob.

16:46.684 --> 16:48.345
Make yourself at home.

16:49.587 --> 16:50.918
Excuse me.

17:55.085 --> 17:57.110
How did they look, Bob?

18:03.527 --> 18:05.324
You better check those hooves.

18:05.362 --> 18:07.421
Some of them look
like they're infected.

18:08.599 --> 18:11.329
I'll take care of them
right away, Bob. Thank you.

18:14.505 --> 18:15.995
See you next month!

18:16.774 --> 18:17.763
You bet.

18:32.623 --> 18:34.716
Do you need help?
Do you need help?

18:34.758 --> 18:36.885
Let us know right away.

18:36.927 --> 18:40.658
You there, send in your letters.
We'll pray for you.

18:40.698 --> 18:42.996
You got a problem?
We're gonna help you do that.

18:43.033 --> 18:47.333
Take care of everything because
the word here tells us...

18:47.371 --> 18:49.931
that we must help you.

18:49.974 --> 18:52.408
But you got to help us
help you...

18:52.443 --> 18:53.910
How are you feeling, child?

18:55.346 --> 18:56.938
I'm so confused.

18:58.315 --> 19:01.079
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

19:01.118 --> 19:04.178
I don't know whether I should
go back home or try and...

19:04.221 --> 19:07.679
You need to get better
before you rush off anywhere.

19:09.693 --> 19:11.024
Poor Bo...

19:12.963 --> 19:14.692
Bo was the only person that l...

19:23.507 --> 19:25.031
What is it, child?

19:25.075 --> 19:28.067
Do you feel all alone
in this world?

19:29.680 --> 19:32.240
None of us are
ever really alone.

19:33.384 --> 19:35.215
You do have someone.

19:40.557 --> 19:42.024
What do you mean?

19:42.059 --> 19:43.720
Well, you have yourself.

19:45.296 --> 19:46.627
Think about it.

19:47.931 --> 19:49.455
You've been blessed, child.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.129
Oh, the ways of the Lord
are mysterious.

19:53.170 --> 19:55.638
The very fact that you're
sitting here with us...

19:55.673 --> 19:58.335
proves that it was preordained.

20:01.378 --> 20:02.572
Yeah.

20:03.681 --> 20:05.171
I guess you're right.

20:07.818 --> 20:09.285
Vincent, Ida...

20:11.388 --> 20:13.379
I feel good here.

20:14.692 --> 20:17.286
I don't know how I'm ever going
to thank you both enough...

20:17.328 --> 20:20.991
for being so kind to me
and saving my life.

20:21.031 --> 20:24.091
Oh, don't mention it, child.

20:24.134 --> 20:27.399
That's right. That's all
that matters to us, child.

20:27.438 --> 20:31.772
That you get better.
Now, you go to bed.

20:38.315 --> 20:39.873
Good night, Vincent.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.179
Sweet dreams.

20:42.186 --> 20:43.517
Ida.

24:15.532 --> 24:17.932
Another spot check, Bob?

24:41.792 --> 24:43.589
I've had enough,
I've had enough

24:43.627 --> 24:45.117
I've had it up to here, girl

24:45.162 --> 24:46.789
I've had enough,
I've had enough

24:46.830 --> 24:48.127
I'm up to here with you

24:48.165 --> 24:49.393
I've had enough,
I've had enough

24:49.433 --> 24:50.900
I've had it up to here, girl

24:50.934 --> 24:52.458
I've had enough

24:58.375 --> 25:00.240
I've suffered enough for you

25:00.277 --> 25:03.178
And then you turned your back on
me and found another mother

25:03.213 --> 25:06.114
I'm up to here with

25:06.149 --> 25:07.844
You

25:30.340 --> 25:33.241
Like a saint, I rose and...

25:33.276 --> 25:36.404
Oh, man, this red's too heavy.
We better find a place to crash.

25:50.894 --> 25:52.919
Mike, watch it!

25:52.963 --> 25:54.362
Mike, what's wrong?

26:07.644 --> 26:09.805
Hey, hey! Come on, man!

26:13.684 --> 26:15.151
Hey, hey! What's that?

26:16.620 --> 26:18.110
- What's that smell?
- What's going on?

26:54.758 --> 26:56.419
Traps work out OK?

26:57.661 --> 26:59.458
Yeah.

26:59.496 --> 27:01.726
You know, I'm just
beginning to realize...

27:01.765 --> 27:04.029
how important they are to me.

27:05.569 --> 27:07.833
The bear traps?
How's that, Vincent?

27:07.871 --> 27:09.338
No, no, no.

27:09.372 --> 27:13.672
I mean the traps;
shooting out the tires...

27:13.710 --> 27:15.735
chains stretched
across the highway,

27:15.779 --> 27:18.213
and the way we had you lying
by the side of the road...

27:18.248 --> 27:20.682
next to that old Chevy
we set on fire.

27:20.717 --> 27:22.344
You know what I mean, the traps.

27:22.385 --> 27:25.684
Oh, sure. But how come
they're so important to you?

27:25.722 --> 27:31.058
Well, because they give me
a chance to be creative.

27:32.496 --> 27:36.762
Oh. Sort of artistic?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.199
Yeah.

27:38.235 --> 27:40.260
And that way, the work
we're doing here...

27:40.303 --> 27:42.669
will always be as special
as it is important.

27:43.306 --> 27:47.140
Oh, I almost forgot,
I have a surprise for you.

27:47.177 --> 27:49.737
Oh, goody. I love surprises.

29:22.906 --> 29:24.703
Well...

29:24.741 --> 29:27.437
that healed right nicely.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.375
What?

29:32.415 --> 29:34.076
What's that you say?

29:35.218 --> 29:37.846
Come on, speak up!

29:37.888 --> 29:39.856
You see, when your
vocal chords have been slit...

29:39.890 --> 29:41.084
you've got to answer
real clearly...

29:41.124 --> 29:42.785
if you expect anyone
to understand you.

29:44.527 --> 29:45.721
Oh, no, no, no.

29:45.762 --> 29:47.787
You just haven't got
the hang of it yet.

29:47.831 --> 29:50.891
Now, don't worry, you will.
You'll catch on.

29:50.934 --> 29:52.265
I know you will.

30:10.587 --> 30:13.385
Well, start bringing them in.

30:13.423 --> 30:15.550
Hey, what about my surprise.

30:15.592 --> 30:17.890
You're right. Come over here.

30:17.928 --> 30:18.917
OK.

30:23.099 --> 30:24.566
Guess who?

30:24.601 --> 30:26.535
Well, I give up.

30:28.204 --> 30:29.728
Bob!

30:30.774 --> 30:34.801
Good to see you.
When did you drop in?

31:42.445 --> 31:43.571
Plant 'em.

32:26.423 --> 32:28.687
And you wonder how
I keep my shape.

32:30.093 --> 32:32.254
Ah, let's see what we got here.

32:33.763 --> 32:36.254
Funny-looking critters,
ain't they, Vincent?

32:36.299 --> 32:37.561
Yeah, maybe so.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.067
But you know as well as I do...

32:39.102 --> 32:41.229
it takes all kinds
of critters...

32:41.271 --> 32:43.831
To make Farmer Vincent fritters!

33:35.592 --> 33:36.616
This one.

33:51.274 --> 33:52.400
It's like...

33:52.442 --> 33:55.570
I've never really
tasted ham before.

33:55.612 --> 33:56.738
It's true.

33:56.779 --> 33:57.905
It's just impossible...

33:57.947 --> 33:59.574
to go back to regular
smoked meats...

33:59.616 --> 34:01.208
after you tried Vincent's.

34:01.251 --> 34:03.185
You can't beat the flavor.

34:03.219 --> 34:04.811
No wonder you're famous.

34:06.055 --> 34:08.523
How come I never
heard of you before?

34:08.558 --> 34:11.025
Well, Farmer Vincent's
meats are only distributed...

34:11.060 --> 34:13.187
within a hundred mile radius.

34:13.228 --> 34:15.025
That way, I can keep
the quality high...

34:15.063 --> 34:17.032
and the cost reasonable.

34:17.065 --> 34:19.694
So, how did you get started?

34:19.735 --> 34:24.536
Well, in the old days,
we couldn't afford an icebox.

34:24.574 --> 34:26.701
So Granny used to
smoke everything.

34:26.743 --> 34:29.541
Chickens, rabbits, squirrels...

34:29.579 --> 34:31.376
eels, even frogs.

34:31.414 --> 34:33.143
If it didn't move fast enough...

34:33.183 --> 34:34.172
Granny smoked it.

34:38.321 --> 34:42.223
Well, we had this old dog, see,
and it used to bother Granny...

34:42.257 --> 34:44.054
barking through her naps
and all that.

34:44.092 --> 34:47.221
So one day she asked me
to shush it for her.

34:47.263 --> 34:49.629
I shushed it, all right.

34:49.666 --> 34:51.429
Yeah. He sure did.

34:51.467 --> 34:54.458
He smoked that old dog
just like a hog.

34:56.105 --> 34:58.073
That night Vincent
served it for dinner.

34:59.008 --> 35:00.566
And Granny liked it so much...

35:00.610 --> 35:03.078
she nearly ate
the whole pooch herself.

35:06.783 --> 35:08.842
Oh, she was so grateful,
she taught Vincent...

35:08.885 --> 35:10.182
all her smoking secrets.

35:10.220 --> 35:12.245
She knew she was eating a dog?

35:12.288 --> 35:14.347
Well, Granny never put
any distinctions...

35:14.390 --> 35:16.017
on any of God's creatures.

35:16.059 --> 35:17.356
She always used to say...

35:17.393 --> 35:19.759
"Meat's meat,
and man's gotta eat."

35:24.200 --> 35:26.361
She sure loved that old doggy.

35:27.337 --> 35:28.326
Ew!

35:28.371 --> 35:30.999
- Oh, it wasn't so bad.
- You tried it?

35:31.040 --> 35:34.601
Sure. It was kind of like
goat meat, wasn't it, Vince?

35:34.644 --> 35:37.340
Yeah, it's a little
more stringy.

35:38.581 --> 35:42.813
Want to know why Vincent's meat
tastes so good?

35:43.486 --> 35:45.351
- Why?
- What are you whispering?

35:45.388 --> 35:47.549
She's telling me why
the meat tastes so good.

35:47.590 --> 35:52.050
It's because he mixes
the pork with... ohh!

35:58.768 --> 36:01.236
Because I mix the pork
with secret spices...

36:01.271 --> 36:04.638
and Ida knows how important
that recipe is to me.

36:04.674 --> 36:06.835
Yeah, let's take a walk.

36:06.876 --> 36:07.865
OK.

36:15.718 --> 36:18.812
I wouldn't have said
anything, you old fool!

36:25.561 --> 36:27.028
Why did he hit her?

36:27.063 --> 36:29.293
Oh, they like to tease
each other.

36:29.332 --> 36:32.028
They're both a little...
different.

36:32.068 --> 36:33.899
But they don't mean any harm.

36:36.406 --> 36:37.373
So...

36:37.407 --> 36:39.398
So... what?

36:41.077 --> 36:43.045
So, you must be going
a little stir crazy...

36:43.079 --> 36:45.047
up at that motel
with nothing to do.

36:45.081 --> 36:47.049
Not at all.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.880
It's been wonderful for me.

36:48.918 --> 36:51.386
I never lived
in the country before.

36:51.421 --> 36:52.752
I love it.

36:53.756 --> 36:55.724
Oh...

36:55.758 --> 36:57.385
You sound disappointed.

36:57.427 --> 37:00.396
Oh, not at all.
I'm real glad.

37:00.430 --> 37:02.398
I was just kind of
hoping you might want to...

37:02.432 --> 37:04.491
go see the new movie
at the drive-in.

37:04.534 --> 37:06.161
What is it?

37:06.202 --> 37:09.171
It's "The Monster That
Challenged the World."

37:09.205 --> 37:10.695
Sounds like fun.

37:48.745 --> 37:50.713
Listen to 'em eat.

37:50.747 --> 37:52.908
Ain't that a good sound, Ida?

37:54.083 --> 37:55.880
Well, anything's better
than that damn hissing...

37:55.918 --> 37:57.545
and wheezing.

37:57.587 --> 37:59.384
Well, that's not
so much to complain about.

37:59.422 --> 38:01.219
They're good animals.

38:01.257 --> 38:03.987
Not like taking care
of chickens or hogs.

38:04.026 --> 38:05.653
Cut out their tongues.

38:05.695 --> 38:07.663
That would take care
of the hissing.

38:07.697 --> 38:10.097
Hey, you could smoke
their tongues.

38:10.133 --> 38:12.158
Well, I tried that.
Texture's all wrong.

38:12.201 --> 38:13.930
Won't mix with the pork.

38:14.937 --> 38:18.236
Hey, Vincent, I think this one
is just about ready.

38:24.380 --> 38:27.349
Almost, but not quite.

38:27.383 --> 38:30.181
Tomorrow he'll be
ready to become famous.

38:30.219 --> 38:31.686
Hey, Vincent...

38:31.721 --> 38:33.689
do you think in the years
to come...

38:33.723 --> 38:37.056
people will appreciate us
for what we're doing here?

38:37.994 --> 38:39.188
You do understand.

38:39.228 --> 38:41.355
Well, of course I do, you dummy.

38:41.397 --> 38:44.525
Do you think I'm doing
all this just for the fun?

38:44.567 --> 38:46.535
Somebody's got to take
a little responsibility...

38:46.569 --> 38:47.934
for the planet!

38:47.970 --> 38:49.699
Ida, you sweetheart.

38:49.739 --> 38:52.367
I'm sorry I underestimated you.

38:52.408 --> 38:53.739
You better be.

38:55.311 --> 38:57.711
Don't you just love
listening to the radio...

38:57.747 --> 38:59.544
just enjoying all this
good music?

38:59.582 --> 39:02.050
Oh, my gracious,
it's good to be with you.

39:02.084 --> 39:04.211
We got one now
by Leroy Willie Washington,

39:04.253 --> 39:06.653
and it's gonna really
turn you on.

39:06.689 --> 39:09.351
He's there... he's right here
by your side.

39:10.526 --> 39:12.153
Is this the drive-in?

39:12.195 --> 39:13.162
Yep.

39:13.196 --> 39:14.823
Not very funny, Bruce.

39:14.864 --> 39:16.491
I think we better just
turn around and...

39:16.532 --> 39:19.660
What the hell?
No wonder. Wrong tree.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.533
Hold on a sec.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.701
This is the Sheriff.

39:25.741 --> 39:28.505
You are violating
the law and have...

39:28.544 --> 39:32.173
exactly 2 minutes to clear out.

39:32.215 --> 39:34.206
Now, move out, please.

39:37.053 --> 39:39.715
Come on, move that Ford there.
Let's move it.

39:39.755 --> 39:41.985
Let's go. Move it now. You, too!

39:42.024 --> 39:43.685
You! Halt!

39:43.726 --> 39:45.694
Now, get back in that vehicle...

39:45.728 --> 39:47.195
before I make arrests.

39:47.230 --> 39:52.532
Now, move your asses.
Move! Let's go.

39:52.568 --> 39:54.661
Keep it moving, now.

39:54.704 --> 39:57.036
Let's get that Vega
moving on, too.

39:57.073 --> 39:58.938
I mean now. Let's go.

40:14.590 --> 40:17.058
What was all that about?

40:17.093 --> 40:18.424
You'll see.

40:23.266 --> 40:25.234
There you go.

40:25.268 --> 40:28.101
Now, look right down there.

40:32.708 --> 40:34.107
All right!

40:36.045 --> 40:38.070
- Yeah, Dixie?
- Moonlight drive-in.

40:38.114 --> 40:39.445
- This is Bruce.
- Hi, Bruce.

40:39.482 --> 40:42.042
Will you feed the sound
onto channel 22?

40:42.084 --> 40:43.244
- Sure thing!
- Thanks.

40:43.286 --> 40:45.254
Mommy!

40:45.288 --> 40:47.586
Hey. This is great.

40:47.623 --> 40:49.614
But how are you going to see?

41:01.137 --> 41:03.537
1,500 bucks in 2 days.

41:03.573 --> 41:06.371
That's what I call
a great weekend.

41:06.409 --> 41:09.537
I wish that ski season
lasted all year.

41:09.579 --> 41:10.978
Yeah, it was OK.

41:12.114 --> 41:13.274
What's with you?

41:14.684 --> 41:17.346
You know that instructor
I made it with for the lessons?

41:17.386 --> 41:19.718
- The blonde?
- Yeah.

41:20.756 --> 41:22.417
I think he had you-know-what...

41:26.262 --> 41:28.423
Will you look at those
stupid cows!

41:28.464 --> 41:29.954
I don't believe this.

41:32.034 --> 41:34.434
Something's weird.

41:34.470 --> 41:36.233
They look fake.

41:37.073 --> 41:38.563
Is this some kind of a joke?

41:43.446 --> 41:44.708
I don't dig the vibes here.

41:44.747 --> 41:46.908
Why don't you just
drive around them.

41:46.949 --> 41:49.747
I can't.
There's not enough room.

41:49.785 --> 41:51.514
Come on. Move 'em, Debbie.

41:51.554 --> 41:52.953
Just knock 'em over.

41:52.989 --> 41:55.014
Are you gonna pay
for my bodywork?

41:56.459 --> 41:58.757
Ah, shit, but you owe me
a big one.

41:59.462 --> 42:01.020
Well, take the gun.

42:06.402 --> 42:07.960
Forget it. You do it.

42:09.238 --> 42:11.229
You chicken shit!

42:40.436 --> 42:42.097
Let's get out of here.

42:46.776 --> 42:49.267
No! No!

42:54.617 --> 42:56.414
No!

43:09.231 --> 43:11.631
Get help. Hear me?

43:30.920 --> 43:31.909
Bruce...

43:33.089 --> 43:34.420
Please don't.

43:34.457 --> 43:35.446
OK?

43:46.936 --> 43:49.598
Bruce! What are you...?

43:50.773 --> 43:54.231
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me, please!

43:54.276 --> 43:56.574
OK! All right.

43:56.612 --> 43:57.806
I'm sorry.

43:57.847 --> 43:59.576
I didn't say that.

43:59.615 --> 44:00.673
You didn't?

44:00.716 --> 44:03.344
No. And the movie just ended.

44:05.387 --> 44:08.185
Dixie, this is Bruce.
Are you OK?

44:08.224 --> 44:10.385
Yeah. But somebody's in trouble.

44:11.393 --> 44:14.260
10-33. This is Sheriff Smith.
What's your 20?

44:14.296 --> 44:15.695
Oh, no!

44:15.731 --> 44:16.823
No!

44:27.076 --> 44:28.805
What's your 20?

44:30.346 --> 44:31.540
Do you copy?

44:31.580 --> 44:34.140
What are you saying?
Talk in English!

44:35.084 --> 44:37.382
Where are you?
What's wrong?

44:37.419 --> 44:39.478
Somebody's trying to kill me!

44:41.724 --> 44:42.884
Where are you?

44:42.925 --> 44:44.722
Oh, no! I'm on Highway 52...

44:44.760 --> 44:48.787
about 10 miles
outside of Grainville.

45:20.796 --> 45:23.356
- Terry, check on that woman.
- How do I do it?

45:23.399 --> 45:25.424
Press the button on the mike
and ask her where she is.

45:25.467 --> 45:27.799
This is the Sheriff's car.
Where are you now?

45:37.146 --> 45:38.272
I guess she can't hear us.

45:49.592 --> 45:52.561
- Hey, look. I saw something.
- Where?

45:52.595 --> 45:53.926
Up around that bend.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.289
Nuts!

46:00.436 --> 46:02.097
I'll get out and push.

46:05.708 --> 46:07.198
Ok. Start slow.

46:07.243 --> 46:10.770
Then when I yell, stand on it.

46:12.047 --> 46:13.947
Ok. Stand on it!

46:22.391 --> 46:23.380
Bruce?

46:44.747 --> 46:48.046
There. That ought to hold it.

46:54.757 --> 46:55.724
Nice work.

46:55.758 --> 46:58.226
Aw, thanks, Vincent.

46:58.260 --> 46:59.249
Poultice.

47:11.206 --> 47:13.174
Who's that?

47:13.208 --> 47:14.675
Brucey?

47:14.710 --> 47:17.838
No. That ain't Bruce's car.

47:17.880 --> 47:21.680
Did you turn on
the No Vacancy sign?

47:21.717 --> 47:22.775
Whoops.

47:22.818 --> 47:24.183
Well, I sure love you folks...

47:24.219 --> 47:25.345
over there in Grainville...

47:25.387 --> 47:26.854
listening to old Wolfman Jack.

47:26.889 --> 47:28.857
Sure has been a pleasure
having you folks listen.

47:28.891 --> 47:30.449
Here. Take a bite of that.

47:30.492 --> 47:31.516
What is it?

47:31.560 --> 47:33.084
Beef jerky. The best.

47:34.396 --> 47:38.196
- Guess who owns this place?
- Roy Rogers.

47:38.233 --> 47:40.531
No. Take a look at the label.

47:43.072 --> 47:46.166
"Farmer Vincent."
Who the hell is that?

47:46.208 --> 47:48.642
He makes the best meats
in the whole world.

47:48.677 --> 47:50.201
I practically grew up on it.

47:50.245 --> 47:52.713
Ugh! Really?

47:52.748 --> 47:55.376
Well, that's just great, Guy.

47:55.417 --> 47:57.214
What about the room?

47:57.252 --> 47:59.083
I don't know.
There's nobody around.

48:01.090 --> 48:03.149
Evening, folks.

48:03.192 --> 48:06.423
Uh, we decided to retire
a little earlier tonight.

48:06.462 --> 48:07.759
I can dig it.

48:07.796 --> 48:10.230
"Early to bed, early to rise..."

48:10.265 --> 48:12.324
Ha ha! If you get my meaning.

48:12.368 --> 48:13.995
What can I do for you?

48:14.036 --> 48:17.335
Well, uh, we'd like
a room for the night.

48:17.940 --> 48:19.874
Come on inside. I'll fix you up.

48:29.218 --> 48:30.913
Come on.

48:38.060 --> 48:40.858
Hey, this place is cool,
isn't it?

48:40.896 --> 48:42.761
Well, we can turn up
the heat if you like.

48:45.734 --> 48:48.703
"Turn up the heat."
That's too... that's... what?

48:48.737 --> 48:50.864
Are you sure this is
the right place?

48:50.906 --> 48:52.601
- Trust me.
- Howdy.

48:52.641 --> 48:54.040
Ma'am.

48:54.076 --> 48:56.044
Well, you look like
a man who knows...

48:56.078 --> 48:57.875
how to get down.

48:57.913 --> 48:59.210
Are you all right, honey?

48:59.248 --> 49:01.375
I'm fine. But we were trying
to find some woman...

49:01.417 --> 49:03.749
who was yelling that somebody
was trying to kill her.

49:03.786 --> 49:05.151
Hey, Vince, did you hear
a 10-33...

49:05.187 --> 49:07.121
on your scanner
about half an hour ago?

49:07.156 --> 49:08.316
No, I didn't.

49:08.357 --> 49:09.984
But maybe it's because
I wasn't listening.

49:10.025 --> 49:11.151
Hi, everybody.

49:11.193 --> 49:13.320
When did the party start?

49:13.362 --> 49:14.989
There ain't no party.

49:15.030 --> 49:16.497
Bruce was just
asking me if we heard...

49:16.532 --> 49:19.330
any 10-33s on the CB.
Did you hear anything?

49:19.368 --> 49:20.995
Well, as a matter of fact,
I did.

49:21.036 --> 49:22.663
Some kids making prank calls...

49:22.704 --> 49:24.501
screaming murder,
and that kind of thing...

49:24.540 --> 49:27.839
so the truckers and smokies
go on wild goose chases?

49:27.876 --> 49:29.673
Damn. We'll have to
report it to...

49:29.711 --> 49:32.839
the Federal Communications
Commission.

49:32.881 --> 49:35.850
Well, I guess I'll be
heading home now.

49:35.884 --> 49:37.852
If you hear those kids again...

49:37.886 --> 49:39.183
you just give me a call.

49:39.221 --> 49:40.518
Will do.

49:40.556 --> 49:42.023
Good night, Bruce.

49:42.057 --> 49:44.355
I had a real good time.
Thanks a lot.

49:44.393 --> 49:45.690
Uh, yeah. Sure.

49:45.727 --> 49:50.187
Hey, anytime you want
a little excitement...

49:50.232 --> 49:52.063
you know where to find it.

49:53.735 --> 49:55.703
Night, now.

49:55.737 --> 49:56.726
Night.

50:00.242 --> 50:01.368
Good night.

50:01.410 --> 50:03.537
All right.

50:03.579 --> 50:05.206
Look, now that smokey's gone,

50:05.247 --> 50:07.215
do you mind filling us in
on the scene?

50:07.249 --> 50:08.841
The what?

50:08.884 --> 50:11.352
Come on. The action.

50:13.589 --> 50:15.454
There must be some mis...

50:15.491 --> 50:20.019
Uh! Vincent, look.
Here we are.

50:20.062 --> 50:22.223
Oh! Yeah.

50:22.264 --> 50:23.856
Is there anything wrong?

50:23.899 --> 50:26.493
We just didn't expect
to make this issue.

50:26.535 --> 50:28.560
Ain't this great, Vincent?

50:28.604 --> 50:29.866
It sure is.

50:29.905 --> 50:33.397
Uh, cabin 1...

50:33.442 --> 50:35.307
Ida will show you the way.

50:35.344 --> 50:37.312
You want us to register?

50:37.346 --> 50:39.371
No, that won't be necessary.

50:39.414 --> 50:40.904
Dig it.

50:40.949 --> 50:42.917
What do you say
we meet in say, oh...

50:42.951 --> 50:44.248
- 10 minutes.
- Yeah.

50:44.286 --> 50:46.015
That'll be fine.

50:46.054 --> 50:47.817
And why don't you
invite your daughter.

50:47.856 --> 50:49.915
She's not my daughter.

50:50.959 --> 50:52.290
Whatever.

50:53.195 --> 50:55.595
This way, folks.

50:55.631 --> 50:59.590
Oh, Vincent, don't forget
your stretching exercises.

50:59.635 --> 51:03.366
"Stretching exercises"?
I told you!

51:03.405 --> 51:05.134
Easy, Guy, easy.

51:11.747 --> 51:14.215
We have...

51:14.249 --> 51:16.877
Who sent in $1,000.

51:16.919 --> 51:19.285
You know, we're all God's tools.

51:20.923 --> 51:23.153
There's somebody
out there with $1,000...

51:46.281 --> 51:49.444
Edie, where's my jelly?

51:51.954 --> 51:53.512
Aren't you even gonna shave?

51:54.623 --> 51:56.113
I always do.

51:58.360 --> 52:02.353
Just go to your phone
and dial that number...

52:02.397 --> 52:06.197
that you see running underneath
your television screen.

52:06.235 --> 52:07.361
- Hey...
- Huh?

52:07.402 --> 52:09.063
I wonder if they're
into animals.

52:09.104 --> 52:11.095
I certainly hope so!

52:12.507 --> 52:15.635
Oh! I can't take it
when you wiggle that weapon.

52:15.677 --> 52:19.545
If you can't take it,
then I'll take you.

52:25.587 --> 52:27.384
- Oh, Edie...
- Huh?

52:27.422 --> 52:28.389
Warm me up.

52:28.423 --> 52:30.084
Let's get greasy.

52:33.295 --> 52:36.162
We do need this money
to continue the telecast.

52:37.766 --> 52:39.495
Oh, that is...

52:39.534 --> 52:41.502
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

52:41.536 --> 52:44.403
Fantastic. Wha...? What?

52:44.439 --> 52:46.999
What? Oh!

52:47.042 --> 52:50.739
We didn't even get a chance
to warm up, you know.

52:50.779 --> 52:54.078
Oh, great. You're into bondage.

52:54.116 --> 52:55.879
Come on in. We'll all get down.

52:55.917 --> 52:57.077
Thank you.

52:57.119 --> 52:58.882
You look good enough to eat.

53:00.622 --> 53:02.852
I hope so!

53:04.893 --> 53:06.520
Oh! Uh... listen...
do you want me to...

53:06.561 --> 53:09.029
Tie me up, old man.

53:09.064 --> 53:10.691
OK?

53:10.732 --> 53:13.860
- Oh, I'll tie you up.
- All right. Tie me up, girl.

53:13.902 --> 53:17.201
You do that pretty good.
What is this, dog style?

53:17.239 --> 53:18.797
No, ma'am. Hog.

53:18.840 --> 53:21.172
I'm just about ready
to throw in the towel.

53:22.944 --> 53:25.674
Would you put your hands
behind your back, please?

53:25.714 --> 53:28.342
Sure. Listen, you got
any pigs around here?

53:31.987 --> 53:33.386
Nitrous oxide.

53:33.422 --> 53:35.720
Sookie, sookie. Me first.

53:35.757 --> 53:38.055
You take it easy, now.
There's enough for everybody.

53:38.093 --> 53:39.560
Ok. Right.

53:39.594 --> 53:45.055
Ok. Go for it.

53:45.100 --> 53:48.900
Wow! Come on. Let's go!

53:48.937 --> 53:50.404
Okey-dokey.

53:50.439 --> 53:53.408
Listen, that doesn't
smell like laughing gas.

53:53.442 --> 53:55.410
Ah, this is special
laughing gas.

53:55.444 --> 53:57.571
What is that shit?!
What is it? Oh...

53:57.612 --> 53:59.239
With this stuff...

53:59.281 --> 54:01.909
you smell it and we
do the laughing.

54:03.085 --> 54:08.887
All we have to do is give
to be happy.

54:13.962 --> 54:16.021
Well, you're up
bright and early today.

54:16.064 --> 54:19.363
I'm getting used to life
on the farm, I guess.

54:19.401 --> 54:20.527
And you?

54:20.569 --> 54:23.538
Well, today's my day
for planting alfalfa.

54:27.976 --> 54:31.207
How would you like it
if someday I taught you...

54:31.246 --> 54:34.579
the ancient art of meat-smoking?

54:35.917 --> 54:37.214
I'd be honored.

54:37.252 --> 54:39.220
Well, don't be too sure
about that.

54:39.254 --> 54:41.222
Sometimes folks don't
have a stomach for it.

54:41.256 --> 54:42.883
Well, don't worry about me.

54:42.924 --> 54:44.915
Mine's cast-iron.

54:44.960 --> 54:45.984
That's a good start.

54:53.769 --> 54:55.430
It's beautiful.

55:00.442 --> 55:02.069
Well... see ya later, honey.

55:02.110 --> 55:03.372
OK.

56:36.071 --> 56:38.198
What are you doing
in here, girl?!

56:38.240 --> 56:40.367
You know what Vincent
would do if he caught you?

56:40.408 --> 56:42.035
I shudder to think of it.

56:42.077 --> 56:43.874
I'm sorry! I was just curious.

56:43.912 --> 56:45.709
The door was open,
and Vincent said...

56:45.747 --> 56:48.875
he was gonna teach me
how to smoke meats.

56:48.917 --> 56:51.442
Ohh... he did?

56:52.754 --> 56:54.722
Yeah. This morning.

56:57.492 --> 57:01.758
Oh, well, I see.
That's... that's different then.

57:06.701 --> 57:09.329
I just want to be
helpful to you, Ida.

57:09.371 --> 57:13.273
Of course, you'll be
able to help out a lot.

57:17.045 --> 57:20.606
That'll be nice.
What a day for tubin'.

57:21.616 --> 57:22.605
"Tubin"'?

57:27.556 --> 57:29.524
Yeah, tubin', my precious one.

57:29.558 --> 57:31.788
Haven't you ever... tubed?

57:40.735 --> 57:42.532
I'm not a very strong swimmer.

57:42.571 --> 57:44.539
Oh, you don't have to be.
That's the beauty of it.

57:44.573 --> 57:46.541
I don't know how to swim at all.

57:46.575 --> 57:47.542
Are you sure?

57:47.576 --> 57:51.342
All right. 1... 2... 3...

58:54.275 --> 58:56.539
Ida, what's that noise?

58:56.578 --> 58:58.842
My tube is leaking.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.075
Hang on! Hang on!
I'll come and help you.

59:01.116 --> 59:03.311
I... I can't swim.

59:03.351 --> 59:08.311
Here. Grab on to my tube.

59:08.356 --> 59:09.345
Ida!

59:33.248 --> 59:35.216
Help! Help!

59:36.217 --> 59:38.048
What are you doing, Vincent?

59:39.554 --> 59:40.543
Vincent!

59:51.885 --> 59:54.649
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

59:56.556 --> 59:58.183
I was just so scared.

01:00:01.061 --> 01:00:02.688
I hope you'll forgive me.

01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:06.392
Yes, of course I do.

01:00:08.902 --> 01:00:11.700
Then I feel better.

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:14.366
Well, I gotta go
tidy up a bit...

01:00:14.407 --> 01:00:16.068
and I'll just leave you 2...

01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:18.903
alone.

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.090
You saved me.

01:00:36.429 --> 01:00:38.590
I can't tell you
what a horrible feeling it is...

01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:40.997
to be pulled down under
by somebody.

01:00:41.034 --> 01:00:44.333
Oh, you poor thing.

01:00:44.371 --> 01:00:46.896
Let's not talk about it anymore.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.238
It's over.

01:00:49.275 --> 01:00:52.244
You feeling better now?

01:00:52.278 --> 01:00:53.905
Yeah.

01:00:53.947 --> 01:00:55.505
Thanks to you.

01:01:09.329 --> 01:01:11.797
Vincent?

01:01:11.831 --> 01:01:13.230
Kiss me.

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:19.299
Not like that!

01:01:21.074 --> 01:01:23.736
Vincent... take me.

01:01:28.314 --> 01:01:30.111
That's indecent. Cover yourself.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:31.276
What's the matter?

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.115
We should be married first.

01:01:39.259 --> 01:01:40.692
Are you proposing to me?

01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:54.499
Vincent, I think I'd like
to be alone for a little while.

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.669
I know.

01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:00.702
I'll... I'll leave you be.

01:02:06.052 --> 01:02:07.849
Glory, glory, glory!

01:02:11.624 --> 01:02:14.923
I'm talking in tongues,
I'm just so happy for you.

01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:16.087
God bless you, Vincent.

01:02:16.129 --> 01:02:17.528
Listen, we're going to
take care of everything.

01:02:17.564 --> 01:02:19.122
We'll have it all done
by tomorrow...

01:02:19.165 --> 01:02:21.030
and it's going to be
a happy day.

01:02:21.067 --> 01:02:22.694
So you don't worry
about anything now.

01:02:22.735 --> 01:02:24.168
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you.

01:02:25.338 --> 01:02:28.364
I believe I'm gonna
have a glory fit.

01:02:28.408 --> 01:02:29.932
Glory, glory...

01:02:43.189 --> 01:02:45.157
Congratulations, Sheriff!

01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:46.215
What for?

01:02:46.259 --> 01:02:47.954
- Surely you must know.
- Uh-uh.

01:02:47.994 --> 01:02:50.462
Vincent's getting married.

01:02:50.497 --> 01:02:52.055
- What?
- That's right.

01:02:52.098 --> 01:02:54.532
He told me to order a service
for him tomorrow.

01:02:55.368 --> 01:02:57.666
I don't believe it!

01:02:57.704 --> 01:02:59.262
Who's he getting married to?

01:02:59.305 --> 01:03:03.173
Sheriff, is that a lewd magazine
you have in your car there?

01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:05.404
Oh, uh... that?

01:03:05.445 --> 01:03:08.346
I confiscated it
from one of the kids.

01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:11.350
Sheriff, please give it to me
so I can properly destroy it.

01:03:11.384 --> 01:03:14.251
Oh, uh... sure.

01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:15.276
Here you go.

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:19.451
Say, who's gonna be
Vincent's bride anyway?

01:03:19.492 --> 01:03:22.120
Oh, that poor thing
that he rescued...

01:03:22.162 --> 01:03:23.459
from the motorcycle accident.

01:03:23.496 --> 01:03:25.293
That's impossible.

01:03:25.331 --> 01:03:28.494
Well, the Lord's ways
are sometimes mysterious.

01:03:28.535 --> 01:03:30.765
I'll say. See you later.

01:03:30.803 --> 01:03:32.430
She wouldn't marry
an old goat like that...

01:03:32.472 --> 01:03:33.871
unless he put a gun
to her head.

01:03:33.907 --> 01:03:35.033
I bet that's it.

01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:37.304
I bet the old geezer finally
flipped out.

01:03:48.188 --> 01:03:50.019
Oh, my god.

01:03:51.191 --> 01:03:53.182
Oh, glory!

01:04:02.602 --> 01:04:03.626
Hi, Brucey!

01:04:04.871 --> 01:04:06.566
You're sick, you know that?

01:04:06.606 --> 01:04:07.573
Both of you!

01:04:07.607 --> 01:04:08.972
Terry!

01:04:09.008 --> 01:04:11.340
Terry, where are you?

01:04:11.377 --> 01:04:13.436
She's taking a bath, Brucey.

01:04:13.479 --> 01:04:14.673
We'll see about that.

01:04:14.714 --> 01:04:17.239
I don't have a warrant,
but you try and stop me!

01:04:17.283 --> 01:04:19.410
What the heck?

01:04:24.324 --> 01:04:25.348
Terry!

01:04:37.537 --> 01:04:40.062
Bruce, what are you doing?

01:04:42.508 --> 01:04:45.636
- You're all right!
- Of course I'm all right.

01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:48.010
Is it?

01:04:50.683 --> 01:04:52.310
Are you and Vincent...

01:04:52.352 --> 01:04:55.116
Yeah! We're getting married
tomorrow afternoon.

01:04:55.154 --> 01:04:57.782
I don't believe it!

01:04:57.824 --> 01:04:59.985
You mean he's not forcing you?

01:05:00.026 --> 01:05:01.891
Forcing me?

01:05:01.928 --> 01:05:04.328
- I love Vincent.
- Oh, you're sick.

01:05:04.364 --> 01:05:05.661
I am not sick!

01:05:05.698 --> 01:05:07.666
Well, what about us?

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.669
I'm madly in love with you!

01:05:10.703 --> 01:05:12.193
You can't marry Vincent!

01:05:12.238 --> 01:05:14.399
Bruce, will you listen to me!

01:05:16.442 --> 01:05:19.377
I love Vincent,
and he's gonna be my old man!

01:05:19.412 --> 01:05:20.379
Get it?

01:05:20.413 --> 01:05:22.438
You can't marry him.

01:05:22.482 --> 01:05:24.450
The law won't allow it!

01:05:24.484 --> 01:05:27.009
- He's insane!
- He is not.

01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:29.021
Oh...

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:30.920
Didn't he tell you?

01:05:30.957 --> 01:05:35.087
He's got syphilis of the brain!

01:05:35.128 --> 01:05:38.427
That's right!
He's not normal at all...

01:05:38.464 --> 01:05:39.863
and he's dumb, yeah...

01:05:39.899 --> 01:05:42.390
and his pecker
don't work either!

01:05:42.435 --> 01:05:43.925
Boy, are you going
to be disappointed...

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:45.631
when he gets out
of those overalls...

01:05:45.672 --> 01:05:46.730
on his wedding night...

01:05:46.773 --> 01:05:49.003
and there's this
shriveled-up prune!

01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:51.943
I think you better leave
before Vincent comes back.

01:05:51.978 --> 01:05:54.469
Let him come back!

01:05:54.514 --> 01:05:56.379
You think I'm scared of him?

01:05:57.617 --> 01:05:58.606
What's the matter?

01:06:00.286 --> 01:06:02.481
Oh, hi, Vince.

01:06:02.522 --> 01:06:04.752
Pretty good joke, huh?

01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:06.315
Huh?

01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:08.657
Oh, come on, Vince.
Better put that down.

01:06:08.695 --> 01:06:10.094
You know, accidents do happen.

01:06:10.129 --> 01:06:11.926
If there weren't
a lady present...

01:06:11.964 --> 01:06:13.761
you might not be alive
right now.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.131
Well, don't be such a...

01:06:17.704 --> 01:06:21.231
Well, I'm sorry to see that
you're taking this so hard.

01:06:25.878 --> 01:06:28.938
You're gonna regret that,
Vincent.

01:06:28.981 --> 01:06:32.508
Don't forget...
I'm the law around here!

01:06:32.552 --> 01:06:35.112
Oh, no, Vince! Oh! Don't!

01:06:45.998 --> 01:06:48.125
I have a little surprise
for you.

01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:49.293
What is it?

01:06:49.335 --> 01:06:50.825
Just a little something.

01:06:55.508 --> 01:06:58.170
- It's so beautiful...
- Here, here.

01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:02.413
Only the best
for my little girl.

01:07:06.886 --> 01:07:08.979
All right!

01:07:09.021 --> 01:07:12.184
A party! Champagne! Great!

01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:24.434
Thank you.

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:26.995
Well...

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:30.065
here's to Terry,
my bride-to-be...

01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:32.703
and the sweetest
little creature...

01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:34.713
since sugar-cured ham.

01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:36.578
And... me?

01:07:36.616 --> 01:07:38.345
Well, what for?

01:07:39.886 --> 01:07:41.410
For the hell of it.

01:07:41.454 --> 01:07:43.012
All right!

01:07:43.055 --> 01:07:46.616
Here's to my little sister Ida,
for the hell of it!

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.551
Kind of tickles the tummy,
doesn't it?

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:56.226
- Can I have a kiss?
- Yeah.

01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:13.912
Oh. Excuse me.

01:08:16.589 --> 01:08:18.147
Thank you, Ida.

01:08:18.191 --> 01:08:19.658
Are you nervous?

01:08:19.692 --> 01:08:21.785
Yeah, I am a little bit.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:25.024
Well, drink up, girl.
That's what it's there for.

01:08:26.198 --> 01:08:27.529
You're right!

01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:32.666
- I love champagne.
- It's good.

01:08:51.057 --> 01:08:53.821
She's out.
Let's go to work.

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:00.683
You think they deserve it?

01:10:00.726 --> 01:10:03.194
Ida, what does
the good book say?

01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:05.026
I know: "Do unto others...

01:10:05.064 --> 01:10:07.624
as ye would have others
do unto ye," right?

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:08.861
Right.

01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:12.769
And no animal should ever suffer
any unnecessary pain.

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:28.148
There, there now.
None of that.

01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:29.848
I have a treat for you.

01:11:24.276 --> 01:11:27.609
I had a feeling you boys
could get behind this.

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:42.752
Now... as you check out
the swirling colors...

01:11:42.795 --> 01:11:47.528
notice how your heads become
more and more mellow.

01:11:49.235 --> 01:11:54.537
Each word I say will take you
farther and farther...

01:11:54.573 --> 01:11:58.168
into a radical hypno high!

01:12:01.013 --> 01:12:05.416
Heavier, but smoother than
any trip you've ever had.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.253
You boys know about
astral projection?

01:12:13.592 --> 01:12:17.392
All right now, by the time
I count to 10...

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:21.457
we're going to project you
beyond Mars!

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.128
We're going to send you
to a place...

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:28.163
where people are so far out,
they have wings!

01:12:30.242 --> 01:12:31.834
All right, here we go.

01:12:32.912 --> 01:12:34.880
10...

01:12:34.914 --> 01:12:36.939
9...

01:12:36.982 --> 01:12:38.176
8...

01:12:38.217 --> 01:12:41.482
Copilot Ida, put the space belts
on our passengers.

01:12:42.088 --> 01:12:44.056
Aye aye, Captain Vincent!

01:13:05.111 --> 01:13:07.306
Space belts in place, Captain.

01:13:08.647 --> 01:13:10.342
7...

01:13:10.382 --> 01:13:12.111
6...

01:13:12.151 --> 01:13:13.345
5...

01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:15.012
Copilot Ida...

01:13:15.054 --> 01:13:17.420
secure the hatches
and prepare for takeoff.

01:13:17.456 --> 01:13:18.650
Aye aye!

01:13:19.925 --> 01:13:21.153
4...

01:13:25.164 --> 01:13:26.791
3...

01:13:26.832 --> 01:13:28.299
Ready for takeoff!

01:13:31.303 --> 01:13:32.292
2...

01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:34.828
1...

01:13:35.508 --> 01:13:36.668
Takeoff!

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.728
Well done.

01:14:04.036 --> 01:14:06.266
Oh, sometimes I wonder about...

01:14:06.305 --> 01:14:08.796
the karmic implications of
these acts.

01:14:10.309 --> 01:14:13.176
I can no more take credit
for the good...

01:14:13.212 --> 01:14:16.113
we've done here tonight
than if...

01:14:16.148 --> 01:14:18.173
if that great pilot
in the sky...

01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:20.344
had blessed each of them...

01:14:20.386 --> 01:14:23.219
with a bolt of lightning
through their hearts.

01:14:24.824 --> 01:14:25.813
Of course.

01:14:27.159 --> 01:14:29.491
Your spaceship awaits you,
Captain.

01:14:30.729 --> 01:14:32.060
Oh, yeah.

01:16:20.039 --> 01:16:21.939
Strip 'em down and clean 'em up.

01:16:21.974 --> 01:16:23.134
Okey-dokey.

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.202
Terry?

01:18:50.989 --> 01:18:53.287
Oh, Bruce, what are you
doing here?

01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:56.556
Don't worry about me.
You're the one who's in danger!

01:18:56.595 --> 01:18:58.222
What are you talking about?

01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:01.130
I think Vincent may be
planning to kill you!

01:19:01.166 --> 01:19:02.861
Oh, Bruce, I can't believe
you're trying...

01:19:02.901 --> 01:19:04.391
to pull that number on me again.

01:19:04.436 --> 01:19:05.630
No, please!

01:19:05.671 --> 01:19:07.002
Look, I did some detective work.

01:19:07.039 --> 01:19:09.633
You won't believe some of
the things I found out!

01:19:09.675 --> 01:19:11.165
You gotta listen to me!

01:19:57.556 --> 01:19:59.046
What the hell's the matter
with you?

01:19:59.992 --> 01:20:02.688
I'm just hungry, that's all.

01:20:02.728 --> 01:20:04.628
Hey, could I slice off
a piece of...

01:20:04.663 --> 01:20:06.927
No, damn it!
You know we're short...

01:20:06.965 --> 01:20:09.365
and I'm not going to smoke
any more than these 3 tonight.

01:20:09.401 --> 01:20:10.390
All right.

01:20:13.472 --> 01:20:15.599
I can't help it!

01:20:15.641 --> 01:20:18.269
Well, then go get something
to eat, but make it snappy.

01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:20.801
Okey-dokey. I'll be right back.

01:20:50.609 --> 01:20:53.169
Terry, come on! Hurry up!

01:20:53.212 --> 01:20:54.941
They'll be back soon!

01:21:00.118 --> 01:21:02.416
I found some of
Vincent's shotgun shells...

01:21:02.454 --> 01:21:04.513
right near where
you had your accident.

01:21:04.556 --> 01:21:05.750
So what?

01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:08.191
He always goes duck hunting
around there.

01:21:10.062 --> 01:21:11.723
Hold out your hand.

01:21:15.567 --> 01:21:18.866
I dug those out of the front
tire of your motorcycle.

01:21:19.938 --> 01:21:23.704
Are you trying to tell me
that he shot us?

01:21:23.742 --> 01:21:25.437
Yeah, I am trying...

01:21:25.477 --> 01:21:27.308
and that's not all.

01:21:30.249 --> 01:21:32.581
Wait till you hear what I
found in the marsh.

01:21:33.552 --> 01:21:35.042
What?

01:21:35.087 --> 01:21:38.147
Oh, only about 200 cars
he ambushed...

01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:39.521
and sunk in there.

01:21:40.259 --> 01:21:42.750
- Come on, let's go.
- I'll be there in a minute.

01:21:43.829 --> 01:21:45.490
Terry, what the hell
are you doing?

01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:49.299
I'm not going to wait
any longer.

01:22:03.382 --> 01:22:06.510
What are you...?

01:22:06.551 --> 01:22:08.678
It's time for your lesson.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.985
We're gonna teach you the finer
points of meat-smoking.

01:22:12.024 --> 01:22:13.013
Go!

01:23:24.329 --> 01:23:26.456
I guess we better
explain everything to her...

01:23:26.498 --> 01:23:29.023
so she can give us a hand.

01:23:29.067 --> 01:23:31.092
The sooner we pack
all this up...

01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:33.468
the sooner we can all
get to bed.

01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:34.494
Right?

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.468
Let her go.

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:40.238
Look at me.

01:23:44.082 --> 01:23:46.380
Look at me, I said.

01:23:47.552 --> 01:23:48.541
Now...

01:23:50.188 --> 01:23:51.655
what do you see?

01:24:02.934 --> 01:24:04.162
Get the hell out of here...

01:24:04.202 --> 01:24:06.864
and get Bruce and bring him
back here right now!

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.130
Okey-dokey.

01:24:59.324 --> 01:25:01.485
What are you doing here, huh?

01:25:03.495 --> 01:25:05.019
Do you need some water?

01:25:09.534 --> 01:25:11.365
Come on, my beauties.

01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:12.665
That's right.

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:46.701
Oh, come on, girl.

01:25:46.738 --> 01:25:48.729
Haven't you ever cleaned a fish?

01:25:50.675 --> 01:25:52.199
There's nothing cruel...

01:25:52.244 --> 01:25:53.575
in what I'm doing here.

01:25:57.482 --> 01:25:58.915
I treat most of my stock...

01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:02.010
better than farmers
treat their animals.

01:26:02.053 --> 01:26:05.250
I don't feed them
chemicals or hormones.

01:26:07.192 --> 01:26:10.059
And when you consider
the way the world is today...

01:26:11.029 --> 01:26:12.758
there's no question
that I'm doing...

01:26:12.797 --> 01:26:14.731
a lot of them a big favor.

01:26:15.634 --> 01:26:18.000
What right do you
have to play God?

01:26:19.704 --> 01:26:21.569
I'm not trying to play God.

01:26:21.606 --> 01:26:23.836
I wouldn't even know
how to begin.

01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:26.002
I'm just helping out.

01:26:26.044 --> 01:26:28.012
There's too many people
in the world...

01:26:29.814 --> 01:26:31.338
and not enough food.

01:26:31.383 --> 01:26:33.180
Now, this takes care
of both problems...

01:26:33.218 --> 01:26:35.277
at the same time.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.582
But humans?

01:26:37.789 --> 01:26:39.689
Human flesh?

01:26:41.526 --> 01:26:43.494
How could you do it?

01:26:43.528 --> 01:26:45.928
What are you talking about?

01:26:45.964 --> 01:26:47.625
Hell, half the people
in this county...

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.327
have been eating human flesh...

01:26:49.367 --> 01:26:51.892
that I have smoked
for over 30 years...

01:26:51.937 --> 01:26:53.165
and loving it.

01:26:53.204 --> 01:26:55.365
You, yourself, said that
my ham was like...

01:26:55.407 --> 01:26:57.398
nothing you'd ever
tasted before.

01:27:03.848 --> 01:27:05.509
I wish I could
have introduced you...

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:08.713
into my private world
in my own way.

01:27:08.753 --> 01:27:10.516
But, oh, no.

01:27:10.555 --> 01:27:12.580
Little brother had to
interfere, didn't he?

01:27:14.059 --> 01:27:15.253
He's a fool!

01:27:16.294 --> 01:27:18.558
And he's the biggest cannibal
in the whole county.

01:27:18.597 --> 01:27:19.757
Did you know that?

01:27:19.798 --> 01:27:21.925
The biggest cannibal
in the whole county.

01:27:24.836 --> 01:27:27.066
Where the hell is she?

01:27:27.105 --> 01:27:29.835
Probably stuffing
her face again.

01:27:29.874 --> 01:27:30.863
Well...

01:27:32.844 --> 01:27:35.244
I better finish these,
or I'll be up all night.

01:28:13.151 --> 01:28:14.140
It's locked...

01:28:16.054 --> 01:28:17.681
from the outside.

01:28:21.092 --> 01:28:23.253
Well, I guess Ida was right.

01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:27.662
She told me you'd never fit in.

01:28:31.002 --> 01:28:33.061
I'm very sorry, Terry.

01:30:24.449 --> 01:30:25.438
Terry?

01:30:45.637 --> 01:30:46.899
Terry?

01:31:24.876 --> 01:31:26.036
Vincent?

01:33:36.207 --> 01:33:37.697
Bruce!

01:33:38.743 --> 01:33:41.974
Bruce! Help me, please!

01:33:42.013 --> 01:33:45.176
Bruce, get me out of here!

01:34:06.537 --> 01:34:08.903
Bruce!

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:10.999
Bruce! Help me!

01:34:23.221 --> 01:34:24.745
Please!

01:34:51.716 --> 01:34:52.705
Vincent?

01:34:59.557 --> 01:35:01.525
Bruce!

01:35:01.559 --> 01:35:02.548
Help!

01:35:04.595 --> 01:35:05.892
Terry!

01:35:18.142 --> 01:35:19.131
There you go.

01:35:28.786 --> 01:35:29.775
Vincent.

01:35:46.838 --> 01:35:48.465
Oh, Lord!

01:36:04.021 --> 01:36:05.352
You can have the...

01:36:06.624 --> 01:36:07.955
the motel...

01:36:10.128 --> 01:36:12.119
and the garden.

01:36:12.163 --> 01:36:13.460
What garden?

01:36:13.498 --> 01:36:16.467
The secret garden...

01:36:18.369 --> 01:36:21.361
at the end of the... dirt road.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.565
And my animals.

01:36:27.044 --> 01:36:31.344
You take care of my animals.

01:36:31.382 --> 01:36:33.282
What's he talking about?

01:36:33.317 --> 01:36:35.114
I'll take care of them, Vince.

01:36:39.757 --> 01:36:41.349
My whole life...

01:36:41.392 --> 01:36:42.689
my whole life has...

01:36:44.262 --> 01:36:46.253
been a lie.

01:36:47.398 --> 01:36:52.267
I'm the biggest hypocrite...

01:36:53.137 --> 01:36:54.832
of them all.

01:36:55.706 --> 01:36:57.367
What do you mean?

01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:02.935
My...

01:37:05.983 --> 01:37:08.076
my meats...

01:37:08.119 --> 01:37:09.780
I...

01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:12.618
I used...

01:37:15.726 --> 01:37:17.887
preservatives.

01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:42.545
Did you see what he was doing?

01:37:42.587 --> 01:37:43.918
I saw.

01:38:43.848 --> 01:38:45.338
I was brought up here, you know.

01:38:46.484 --> 01:38:47.473
Now I'm kind of glad...

01:38:47.518 --> 01:38:49.213
I ran away from home
when I was 11.

01:38:51.155 --> 01:38:53.919
I guess there's gonna have to
be some kind of investigation.

01:38:53.958 --> 01:38:55.687
Why don't you just burn
the place?

01:38:55.726 --> 01:38:56.750
Burn it?

01:38:56.794 --> 01:38:58.785
You mean arson?

01:38:58.829 --> 01:39:00.296
I don't know.

01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:01.821
That's what I'd do.

01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:07.933
It's an evil motel.

01:39:08.305 --> 01:39:14.470
