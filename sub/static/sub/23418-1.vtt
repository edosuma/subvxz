               Stop Right There!

00:41.479 --> 00:44.748
   Stop Right There
   And Surrender Your Weapon.

00:44.816 --> 00:47.417
    Now You'll See--

01:17.265 --> 01:19.883
        [Groans]

01:37.018 --> 01:39.619
 <I>[People Chattering]</I>

01:48.963 --> 01:53.032
Ladies And Gentlemen,
That Concludes The Film Portion
Of Our Presentation.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.401
                I'm Sure You All
                Have Questions.

01:55.469 --> 01:57.771
   So Let Me Introduce You
   To The Head Of Development

01:57.838 --> 02:00.057
       For Secure-Tronics
       Unlimited--

02:00.124 --> 02:02.009
        Dr. Stan Simon.

02:06.030 --> 02:07.897
      Thank You Very Much.

02:07.966 --> 02:12.168
 Before I Open The Floor,
 I'd Like You All To Meet
 Your Brand-New Security Team--

02:12.236 --> 02:15.338
 <I>The Protector 101</I>
 <I>Series Robots.</I>

02:15.406 --> 02:17.374
One Week From Tonight
At Closing,

02:17.441 --> 02:20.277
 <I>The Protectors Will Begin</I>
 <I>Their Patrol Of The Mall.</I>

02:20.345 --> 02:23.746
            Paul, They Look Like
            The Three Stooges.

02:23.848 --> 02:27.801
Each Assigned To One Of
The Three Upper Shopping Levels.

02:27.869 --> 02:31.604
I Don't Know, Mary,
The One In The Middle Has
An Unpleasantly Ethnic Quality.

02:31.672 --> 02:33.807
         Now, Are There
         Any Questions?

02:33.875 --> 02:36.109
            Yes, Dr. Carrington.

02:36.176 --> 02:40.263
So What Do Your Machines There
Do Besides Kill Criminals?

02:40.331 --> 02:43.032
    First Of All,
    The Protectors Do Not Kill.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.519
               I Wonder If They
               Kill Cockroaches.

02:45.586 --> 02:47.654
They Could Probably
Be Programmed To.

02:47.722 --> 02:50.523
And Merely Detain Intruders
Until The Computer,

02:50.591 --> 02:53.810
 <I>Located On The Roof,</I>
 <I>Can Patch Into</I>
 <I>The Mall Phone System</I>

02:53.878 --> 02:55.461
And Send The Alarm
To The Police.

02:55.529 --> 02:58.231
I Don't Know.
That Guy Looked
Awfully Dead To Me.

02:58.299 --> 03:00.801
     Just Neutralized.
     Protectors Can Achieve
     This Function

03:00.868 --> 03:02.736
      In A Number Of Ways.

03:02.804 --> 03:05.939
  At Close Range, Sleep Darts
  Fired From Here And Here

03:05.974 --> 03:08.625
    Can Knock A Man Out
    In Less Than 30 Seconds.

03:08.693 --> 03:11.478
  However, The Likelihood
  Of An Intruder Gaining Entry

03:11.545 --> 03:13.813
  Is Greatly Minimized
  By The Steel Security Doors

03:13.881 --> 03:17.417
 <I>Which Are Time-Locked</I>
 <I>From Midnight 'til Dawn.</I>

03:17.485 --> 03:19.503
   Um, They Seem So Violent.

03:19.571 --> 03:22.872
 If They're Called Protectors,
 What Do They Protect?

03:22.940 --> 03:25.942
           <I>Plenty. For Starters,</I>
           <I>As Seen In The Film,</I>

03:26.010 --> 03:29.112
 The Protectors Do Their Work
 In The Mall Proper,
 Not In The Stores Themselves.

03:29.179 --> 03:32.232
 <I>Maybe We Could Use One</I>
 <I>At The Restaurant--</I>

03:32.300 --> 03:34.667
Get Rid Of People
We Don't Like.

03:34.735 --> 03:36.920
    For Instance, Lasers
    Positioned Here

03:36.987 --> 03:39.222
    Can Cut Through
    Any Sort Of Debris.

03:39.290 --> 03:42.759
Well, That's All Very Well
And Good, But What About
Those Who Work Late?

03:42.827 --> 03:47.497
How Can Your... Things There
Distinguish Between The Good
Guys And The Bad Guys?

03:47.565 --> 03:49.816
    That's Very Simple.

03:49.884 --> 03:53.086
    Watch.
    This Is Simon.

03:54.072 --> 03:56.039
    <I>Bring Number One On-Line.</I>

03:58.242 --> 03:59.209
            [Whirrs]

03:59.276 --> 04:01.144
             Whoa!
                       Wow!

04:04.282 --> 04:06.983
          [Murmuring]

04:10.805 --> 04:13.239
 May I See Your
 Identification Badge, Please?

04:15.293 --> 04:16.910
It's Scanning.

04:16.978 --> 04:20.680
They Remind Me Of Your Mother.
It's The Laser Eyes.

04:20.748 --> 04:22.549
 <I>[Robot]</I>
 <I>Thank You.</I>
 <I>Have A Nice Day.</I>

04:22.616 --> 04:24.885
                 Same To You.
                 There. You See?

04:24.952 --> 04:27.153
The System Is
Absolutely Foolproof.

04:27.221 --> 04:30.206
    Now, Everyone Connected
    With The Mall Has Been
    Issued An I.D. Badge

04:30.274 --> 04:32.408
 <I>So That When The Mechanism</I>
 <I>Goes On-Line,</I>

04:32.476 --> 04:36.846
The Protectors Will Make
Park Plaza The Safest Mall
In The State.

04:36.914 --> 04:38.448
 <I>Trust Me.</I>

04:38.515 --> 04:41.401
 <I>Absolutely Nothing</I>
 <I>Can Go Wrong.</I>

07:02.710 --> 07:04.711
                     Ow!
Are You All Right?

07:04.778 --> 07:06.512
Coffee?
            <I>Come On, Sweetheart!</I>

07:06.580 --> 07:09.782
        Give It To Me!
        What Do You Got?
        <I>Andiamo!</I>

07:09.850 --> 07:13.486
   Can I Get Two
   Uncle Luigi Bellybusters,
   A Double Anchovy Pizza

07:13.554 --> 07:14.838
And An Order
Of Garlic Logs?

07:14.905 --> 07:18.775
Gross. What Mojave
Brain Ordered That?
          Guy Over There.

07:18.843 --> 07:21.027
Oh, God. I Should've Known.

07:21.095 --> 07:23.696
That Orca Beaches
Here Every Night.
Always Trying To Snag Some Skin.

07:23.764 --> 07:27.267
Play It Safe, Alison.
Serve At Arm's Length,
If You Get My Drift.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.102
          <I>Thanks For The Advice.</I>

07:29.169 --> 07:31.021
           Yeah.

07:31.088 --> 07:33.123
             Shit!

07:33.191 --> 07:36.659
       <I>Oh, Honey, You</I>

07:36.727 --> 07:39.161

07:39.229 --> 07:41.498
          <I>Look, Alison, In About</I>
          <I>An Hour And A Half...</I>

07:41.565 --> 07:44.434
     We Bail This Barbecue And
     It's Good Times To The Max.

07:44.502 --> 07:47.003
             You've Got To Show.
Suzie, You've Got
A One-Track Mind.

07:47.070 --> 07:49.005
I Already Told You,
I Don't Know Anybody.

07:49.072 --> 07:52.075
            Yeah, But You Will
            After Tonight.
 <I>That's What I'm Afraid Of.</I>

07:52.143 --> 07:55.194
Would I Set You Up With
A Slime Dog Or Something?

07:55.262 --> 07:57.230
    No Way, "Babe."

07:57.298 --> 07:59.265
     [Together]
     It Is Babe, Isn't It?

07:59.333 --> 08:02.385
    Come On, Come On!
    Take It While It's Hot.

08:02.452 --> 08:05.204
                 <I>Girls, Come On!</I>
 Yeah, All Right,
 All Right.

08:05.272 --> 08:06.422

    I Let You Do This, I'm Dead.

10:08.479 --> 10:11.147
Don't Tell Me, Freddie.
Are You Going Chicken-Shit
On Us Again?

10:11.215 --> 10:12.916
 <I>We Already Agreed.</I>

10:12.983 --> 10:15.969
 He Trusts Me To Take Care
 Of The Store While He's Gone.

10:16.036 --> 10:19.973
He Ain't Gonna Know Diddly
Unless You Tell Him.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.757
You Ain't Gonna
Tell Him, Are Ya?

10:21.759 --> 10:23.576
         Don't Force Me
         To Pull Rank.

10:23.744 --> 10:25.427
Oh, I'm Shaking.

10:25.495 --> 10:28.798
       You Know, Brennan, You're
       Becoming A Real Candidate
       For Prickhood.

10:28.866 --> 10:31.634
        What?
            Look, Guys,

10:31.702 --> 10:34.403
 This Party Is Gonna Happen,
 But We Need A Little Teamwork.

10:34.471 --> 10:38.841
   <I>Besides, If The Place</I>
   <I>Looks Like Shit On Monday,</I>
   <I>It's All Our Asses.</I>

10:39.010 --> 10:40.443
       You Got The Beer?

10:40.511 --> 10:42.245
        Correct.

10:42.312 --> 10:44.681
    Come On. Dude!

10:46.350 --> 10:49.185
The Fridge Is Packed.
          Good. Rick And Linda
          Are Bringing The Food.

10:49.252 --> 10:51.737

11:01.098 --> 11:02.732

11:02.800 --> 11:04.550
 <I>Come On, Ferdy.</I>

11:04.702 --> 11:07.987

 <I>This Is Gonna Work, Okay?</I>

11:08.055 --> 11:11.173
             Ferdy, You Can't
             Back Out On Us Now.

11:12.442 --> 11:15.444
    Okay, Okay, Let's Party.
All Right.

11:15.513 --> 11:17.247
    First I Gotta Find
    Mrs. Flanagan's Fuchsia

11:17.381 --> 11:19.932
You Find
Mrs. Flanagan's Fuchsia.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.052
You, You Hold Down
The Fort.
             I Will.

11:23.119 --> 11:26.372
I'm Gonna Go Find Leslie.
       [Chuckles]
       I'm Sure You Will.

11:29.192 --> 11:30.760

11:33.063 --> 11:35.715
        Don't Worry.

11:35.783 --> 11:37.233
     I Can't Find The Fuchsia.

11:37.451 --> 11:39.569
     Ah, Fuck The Fuchsia.
     It's Friday.

12:02.977 --> 12:07.780
Okay, Butch.
You Know I Can't Resist It
When You Get Tough.

12:11.885 --> 12:14.837
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Just Crank It When I Tell Ya.

12:21.678 --> 12:24.947
            Well? We're Waiting.
Just A Sec, Huh?

12:26.016 --> 12:27.884

12:32.089 --> 12:34.624
     Always The First Time.

12:44.901 --> 12:47.720
I Don't Want To Hear It,
Not Another Word.

12:47.787 --> 12:49.739
            Me? No Way.

12:49.806 --> 12:53.876
       I Covered This Whole Deal
       When I Said, "For Better
       Or Worse," Remember?

12:53.944 --> 12:55.377
Of Course I Remember.

12:55.445 --> 12:59.215
Who Could Forget
That 40-Weight Stain
Right There On Your Chest?

13:00.800 --> 13:03.069
       Should've Been
       "For Better Or Weird."

13:05.272 --> 13:07.873
       And Speaking About Weird,
       What About This
       Furniture Store--

13:07.941 --> 13:10.876
Come On, Walden.
Indulge Me.

13:10.944 --> 13:14.713
We Haven't Had Any Fun Since
We Sunk All Our Wedding Money
Into The Business.

13:14.781 --> 13:17.183
Besides, Suzie's
Counting On Us.

13:17.251 --> 13:20.519
    Honey, I Don't Care About--
Okay. Okay, Okay.

13:20.587 --> 13:22.772
I Guess I Won't
Be Needing This.

13:22.839 --> 13:25.107

   I'm Telling You
   You Should've Kept Her There.

50:21.840 --> 50:24.157

   At Least We're Safe Here
   For The Moment.
Yeah, For The Moment.
