00:12.666 --> 00:14.602
Did he say what it was about?

00:14.701 --> 00:18.003
No. And I tried to get him to tell me.
He said he'd only speak to you.

00:18.104 --> 00:21.305
I've got the Weeks coming in. They're fighting
over the Nantucket house again.

00:21.408 --> 00:24.744
He says he'll only speak to you.

00:27.047 --> 00:29.847
Dwight. How are you?

00:29.950 --> 00:32.922
Oh, not good, Shirley.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.253
- Why?
- Jeanie is leaving me.

00:36.924 --> 00:38.893
What? Why?

00:38.992 --> 00:41.225
And she's trying to have
the marriage annulled.

00:41.328 --> 00:43.890
That's ridiculous,
not to mention impossible.

00:43.997 --> 00:46.127
You've been married over 20 years.

00:46.233 --> 00:48.203
She just wants it all erased...

00:48.301 --> 00:50.602
as if- as if never existed, I guess.

00:50.705 --> 00:53.073
Why? What's gotten into her?

00:54.674 --> 00:57.305
Well, it's more what I've
gotten into, I suppose.

00:59.078 --> 01:02.745
- I strayed.
- You?

01:02.850 --> 01:06.881
Well, I- I can't pretend
I'm not shocked.

01:06.988 --> 01:10.951
Even so, infidelity
isn't grounds for annulment.

01:13.260 --> 01:16.289
There's something
you're not telling me.

01:18.598 --> 01:20.569
I stayed with Wendy.

01:20.668 --> 01:24.505
- You've met Wendy.
- Wendy.

01:26.339 --> 01:29.470
Your... cow?

01:29.577 --> 01:32.412
We became very close.

01:32.512 --> 01:36.008
One night
I'd had a bit to drink, I suppose.

01:36.116 --> 01:38.952
Jeanie and I had been
a little estranged, and-

01:40.988 --> 01:44.860
You strayed... with livestock?

01:44.959 --> 01:48.489
It's not what you think.
It was all very loving.

01:48.595 --> 01:51.089
I know Jeanie. She's going to tee
and make me out a big sick.

01:51.199 --> 01:54.170
- Gee!
- Obviously I made a mistake.

01:54.268 --> 01:57.638
But I've been a good husband
for 23 years...

01:57.738 --> 02:00.471
a deacon at our church,
a model philanthropist...

02:00.575 --> 02:04.139
a respected professor at a major university,
town selectman even.

02:04.245 --> 02:07.547
You sleep with one cow- puff!

02:07.648 --> 02:07.648
Please don't make sport
and don't make light.

02:08.649 --> 02:11.120
Please don't make sport
and don't make light.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.953
I don't want to lose my wife.

02:48.222 --> 02:50.124
You cannot turf this one to me.

02:50.224 --> 02:52.126
- Oh, but I can.
- Shirley!

02:52.226 --> 02:54.823
Look, I can defend almost anyone
against almost anything...

02:54.930 --> 02:57.901
but growing up I had a cow.

02:57.999 --> 03:00.938
- You?
- Not sexually. As a pet.

03:01.036 --> 03:04.236
Bumpy.
I had dogs, cats, a tree frog.

03:04.339 --> 03:06.274
But Bumpy-

03:06.374 --> 03:08.709
I cherished that animal.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.474
To think what Dwight-

03:11.579 --> 03:13.549
I can't go there, Denise.

03:13.649 --> 03:15.949
- What makes you think I can?
- You're being asked to.

03:16.051 --> 03:19.684
The name of this firm is Crane,
Poole & Schmidt. I'm Schmidt.

03:19.788 --> 03:22.054
Shirley, please, I am begging you.

03:22.157 --> 03:24.287
Someone's got to do it, Denise.
Can't be me.

03:33.068 --> 03:36.438
Denny Crane.
I don't know why I'm here.

03:38.306 --> 03:40.709
Denny Crane. I've been summoned.

03:40.809 --> 03:44.374
Denny Crane. Denny Crane.

03:44.479 --> 03:47.382
Denny Crane.

03:47.481 --> 03:49.452
Trial date is set
for December the second.

03:49.551 --> 03:52.044
We will conference
a week from today.

03:52.154 --> 03:54.591
Denny Crane.
Who the hell called and why?

03:54.690 --> 03:57.422
- Oh, Denny Crane.
- Ah, Mr. Crane.

03:57.525 --> 04:01.489
- Recall lessel, would you, please?
- Document number 166253.

04:01.597 --> 04:04.034
Commonwealth versus Ronald Jessel.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.626
Mr. Crane, you've been assigned to represent
one of our indigent defendants.

04:06.735 --> 04:09.263
- Thank you for coming in.
- No can do, Judge.

04:09.371 --> 04:12.775
- I beg your pardon?
- Indigent are poor. Hate the poor. Can't pay.

04:12.874 --> 04:15.243
Mr. Crane, this isn't a request.
It's a court order.

04:15.344 --> 04:18.475
Unless you think that senior partners
are exempt from civic duty?

04:18.579 --> 04:21.677
- Was it a hooker? I can do hookers.
- I tm’s a murder case.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.777
Your client is right there.

04:27.055 --> 04:29.026
Defense pleads guilty.

04:29.125 --> 04:32.495
We accept the district attorney's recommendation
for sentencing. Denny Crane.

04:32.594 --> 04:36.364
Come back here this instant,
or you will be held in contempt, sir.

04:36.465 --> 04:39.437
- What did you just say?
- You will meet your client.

04:39.534 --> 04:42.027
You will return here this afternoon
to enter your plea...

04:42.137 --> 04:44.267
and you will give him
adequate representation.

04:44.373 --> 04:48.439
He allegedly killed a 13-year-old girl,
hence the presence of the media.

04:48.544 --> 04:53.452
He'll get high-profile
representation as well. Go.

05:07.063 --> 05:09.158
Hope you die.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.167
Denny Crane.

05:32.655 --> 05:35.319
Hey, kid. Front and center.

05:37.294 --> 05:40.630
Bet you’d lick my shoes for a murder case,
wouldn’t you, kid?

05:40.730 --> 05:44.329
- Oh, I would, sir.
- 'Cause I like you, you don't have to lick 'em.

05:44.434 --> 05:46.403
- Just dust 'em with your sleeve.
- Yes, sir!

05:46.501 --> 05:50.271
We can't have a clown waxing on
about G8 and world issues.

05:50.373 --> 05:51.864
For God's sake, it's a children's show.

05:51.974 --> 05:55.003
- When did you fire him?
- Friday. He filed for the T. R. O. yesterday.

05:55.111 --> 05:57.582
Look, this could be
a public relations nightmare.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.948
He's the only Zozo
the station's ever had.

06:02.686 --> 06:05.589
- May I help you ladies?
- We're here for the assistant's position.

06:05.688 --> 06:07.989
Hmm.

06:11.394 --> 06:15.129
Congratulations. You're hired.
Thank you all.

06:15.232 --> 06:17.225
- Let's go inside.
- Alan, you can’t just do that.

06:17.334 --> 06:19.327
- You have to at least interview.
- Why?

06:19.435 --> 06:21.735
I have a very strong feeling
about this one.

06:21.838 --> 06:24.435
- Can you type?
- Some.

06:24.540 --> 06:27.068
See?

06:27.177 --> 06:29.579
What happened to Shirley?

06:29.679 --> 06:34.587
Shirley likes to assign cases to the hot hand,
and right now I'm hot.

06:34.684 --> 06:37.748
I've known her since we were kids.
I mean, she knows me. That's why I-

06:37.855 --> 06:40.917
Which is exactly why you should
be with someone else.

06:42.259 --> 06:46.563
Shirley could be too close
to see things objectively.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.063
It's Bumpy, isn't it?

06:52.169 --> 06:54.571
I had such a crush on that cow.

06:56.774 --> 06:58.835
That doesn't make me gay.

06:58.942 --> 07:02.108
Mr. Biddle, have you, um,
gotten counseling for this?

07:02.213 --> 07:05.776
Yes. Yes. I'm- I'm working on it.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.650
Look, Jeanie married me
for better or worse, right?

07:08.752 --> 07:12.123
And for 20-plus years,
it's been a great marriage.

07:12.223 --> 07:16.960
I still love her.
I don't want to lose her.

07:25.269 --> 07:29.107
Defense enters a plea of not guilty.
At this time, we would like to be heard on bail.

07:29.206 --> 07:31.176
Hold unjust a second.
Where is Denny Crane?

07:31.276 --> 07:35.306
I'm an attorney from Crane, Poole
& Schmidt, sir. I'm appearing on h-

07:35.412 --> 07:38.317
I didn't assign this case
to Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.479
I assigned it to Denny Crane, counsel.
Where is he?

07:41.585 --> 07:44.284
He's back at the norm, sir.
I asked him to do a little research.

07:44.389 --> 07:48.523
- Are you making awoke in my courtroom, counsel?
- No, sir.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.595
Step up here, counsel.

07:54.064 --> 07:56.194
Have you ever tried a case before,
counsel?

07:56.301 --> 07:59.330
I won my moot court competition
at Suffolk, sir.

08:01.239 --> 08:03.869
- Turn around.
- What are you going to do?

08:03.974 --> 08:06.343
I asked you to turn around.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.678
I see members of the media here.
Some of you have video cameras.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.842
I invite you to point them this way.

08:11.950 --> 08:16.858
We like to think that all are entitled
to a fair trial in this county...

08:16.955 --> 08:19.118
that we have an advocacy system
about truth.

08:19.224 --> 08:21.194
But the real truth- the ugly one-

08:21.292 --> 08:25.163
is that the indigent
get anything but fairness.

08:25.263 --> 08:27.962
On this side,
we have a district attorney...

08:28.066 --> 08:31.266
with SO homicide trials
under his belt.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.635
And here, representing the accused...

08:33.736 --> 08:38.543
we have a boy who won
his moot court competition in law school.

08:38.642 --> 08:40.772
This is how it is, people.

08:40.879 --> 08:43.543
The poor get the lawyers
who can't get real clients of their own.

08:43.647 --> 08:46.347
We have a system where the State
matches the best and the brightest...

08:46.452 --> 08:48.888
against defense attorneys
coming out of a pool...

08:48.987 --> 08:51.424
of inexperience and incompetence.

08:51.524 --> 08:55.692
It is an insult to our notion of democracy.
It makes a mockery of criminal justice.

08:55.793 --> 08:59.961
I will not indulge a mockery in my courtroom.
Turn around, counsel.

09:00.064 --> 09:04.061
Put one arm behind your back
as if it were tied.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.571
Now, stand on one leg...

09:06.671 --> 09:10.941
as if your client barely has a leg to stand on
with you as his counsel.

09:11.043 --> 09:13.912
Now, you hop on out of here.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.711
Tell Denny Crane if he doesn't
show up to represent his client...

09:16.814 --> 09:18.875
he will bewailed.

09:18.983 --> 09:21.113
Hop! Now!

09:36.168 --> 09:40.438
Clown goes up first.
Why don’t you take him?

09:40.539 --> 09:43.009
Do you have a real name on this guy?

09:43.107 --> 09:45.909
Yeah. Robert Berrien.
But he's been Zoo for 13 years.

09:46.011 --> 09:48.573
I figure I'll take our client on direct.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.650
This is at-will employment?

09:50.749 --> 09:53.379
Yes. But the discharge
has to be in good faith.

09:53.485 --> 09:57.289
He was up for a big contract bump,
so my bet is they're going to argue pretext.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.760
Excuse me.
Could I steal Alan for one second?

10:00.859 --> 10:02.691
We're in a meeting, Melissa.

10:02.794 --> 10:06.234
Oh. Yeah.
It's-It’s just I started thinking.

10:06.332 --> 10:08.802
I think the high
of getting the job kind of-

10:08.900 --> 10:10.928
It just hit me-

10:11.036 --> 10:13.006
um, the criterion
on which I was hired.

10:13.105 --> 10:16.566
And now that I am hired,
I just thought that I should be clear.

10:16.674 --> 10:20.979
I will not be objectified. I will not be ogled.
If am, I write you up.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.450
No touching, no double entendres,
no comments on what I'm wearing.

10:24.550 --> 10:28.615
If get any of that, I write you up.
I'm your assistant, not your subordinate.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.160
You cross that line,
I- I write you up.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.489
Follow the rules, we should-
we should get along fine.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.862
That's all.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.736
I told you to interview.

10:49.174 --> 10:53.376
I will not indulge a mockery in my courtroom.
Turn around, counsel.

10:53.479 --> 10:55.382
Now, stand on one leg...

10:55.482 --> 10:59.786
as if your client barely has a leg to stand on
with you as his counsel.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.821
Now, you hop on out of here.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.020
Tell Denny Crane if he doesn't show up
to represent his client, he will bewailed.

11:06.125 --> 11:09.496
- Hop! Now!
- That was the scene at the courthouse this morning.

11:09.596 --> 11:09.596
Channel 8's own legal analyst, Martin
Tupper, said he's never seen anything-

11:11.163 --> 11:12.996
Channel 8's own legal analyst, Martin
Tupper, said he's never seen anything-

11:13.098 --> 11:14.932
Adjudge says to hop, you do it?

11:15.035 --> 11:17.870
All right, Denny. You obviously
need to take over this case.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.533
- We can send Alan in as backup.
- I don't need a backup.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.239
- Denny!
- I can handle this case. I can handle this judge.

11:25.545 --> 11:27.708
A homicide, right?

11:27.813 --> 11:30.614
Homicide and rape.

11:41.361 --> 11:46.133
Mister Rogers, Sesame Street, Thomas
the Tank Engine, The Magic School Bus.

11:46.232 --> 11:50.104
Oh, you name it. All the top children's
entertainers are educators.

11:50.203 --> 11:52.969
- You never said he'd be in costume.
- Always, in public.

11:53.072 --> 11:55.703
But, Mr. Berrien, why global warming?

11:55.809 --> 11:58.575
Mainly because it's possibly
the number-one threat to this planet...

11:58.678 --> 12:00.614
and our county's
doing almost nothing.

12:00.714 --> 12:02.684
Can you do the cross?

12:02.781 --> 12:04.752
Even so, uh...

12:04.851 --> 12:08.517
none of this seems funny,
and you're a clown.

12:08.621 --> 12:11.149
Global warming could result
in a rising sea level...

12:11.257 --> 12:14.058
that could make a huge part
of the world uninhabitable.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.722
We as Americans
have a responsibility.

12:16.829 --> 12:20.600
The U. S. makes up four percent
of the world's population...

12:20.701 --> 12:24.801
but we produce 2SM
of the carbon dioxide pollution.

12:24.904 --> 12:29.174
Most of any county. The United States
is the leading cause of global warming.

12:29.276 --> 12:32.976
We need to take a leading role
in finding the solution.

12:41.588 --> 12:43.490
Let's go. You're up.

12:46.092 --> 12:48.655
- You go.
- What?

12:48.763 --> 12:52.099
No questions, Your Honor.

12:54.101 --> 12:56.297
What are you doing?

12:56.402 --> 12:59.204
If you want to cross-examine him,
Brad, you do it.

12:59.306 --> 13:02.334
- What's going on?
- Nobody ever said he'd be in costume.

13:08.047 --> 13:11.042
I'm afraid of clowns.

13:14.121 --> 13:16.717
How can anybody be afraid of a clown?

13:16.823 --> 13:19.693
- Keep your voice down!
- Now his testimony goes uncontested.

13:19.794 --> 13:21.764
- You could've crossed.
- I didn't prep a cross.

13:21.861 --> 13:23.889
- What's going on?
- He's afraid of clowns!

13:23.998 --> 13:26.992
I am not. It was strategy.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.164
Hey!

13:33.708 --> 13:36.679
- Any calls?
- Not really.

13:36.777 --> 13:39.010
Afraid of clowns, huh?

13:44.819 --> 13:47.882
- You cannot enter a plea of guilty.
- Why not?

13:47.988 --> 13:50.823
Is it your intent, sir,
to plead guilty to these crimes?

13:50.924 --> 13:52.757
Um, no, sir.

13:52.859 --> 13:55.854
You're not going to take his word for it,
are you? Come on, Judge.

13:55.962 --> 13:58.526
- If he’d murder, he'd lie.
- Step up here, Mr. Crane.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.534
Yes.

14:00.634 --> 14:04.165
Oh, my God.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.171
You can stop trying to get yourself
off the case, counsel.

14:09.276 --> 14:11.109
That isn't going to happen.

14:11.212 --> 14:15.084
Look, Judge, I can't defend a man
who raped and murdered a 13-year-old girl.

14:15.182 --> 14:17.277
- Somebody's got to do it.
- Why me?

14:17.384 --> 14:19.582
Because I said so.

14:19.688 --> 14:22.215
- Which brings me to my second issue.
- Which is?

14:22.323 --> 14:25.785
You're a douche bag.
I don't do well with douche bags.

14:28.028 --> 14:31.262
That won't work either.
You will tee this case.

14:31.365 --> 14:34.030
All you will accomplish with
this unfettered insolence...

14:34.134 --> 14:37.733
is avail sentence for contempt
after you’ve tried this case.

14:37.839 --> 14:40.537
Do I make myself clear, Mr. Crane?

14:42.343 --> 14:45.578
Hmm? Hmm?

14:51.853 --> 14:56.055
I can understand that she's horrified,
but to annul a marriage-

14:56.156 --> 14:58.593
Your Honor, it is so aberrant.

14:58.693 --> 15:01.893
It is such an abomination.
It is so abhorrent.

15:01.996 --> 15:04.331
- And she’s just on the "A" words.
- Let's go to "B" then.

15:04.432 --> 15:07.062
Bestiality.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.263
Is not, never has been grounds
for annulment.

15:09.371 --> 15:13.072
M- Mrs. Biddle, why erase
the whole marriage?

15:15.911 --> 15:18.508
Because it was never real.

15:18.613 --> 15:22.644
- He was always in love with her.
- The cow?

15:22.752 --> 15:25.222
Over the last 1 O years orzo...

15:25.320 --> 15:27.883
sometimes when we'd been together-

15:27.989 --> 15:29.924
which was never a lot-

15:30.024 --> 15:33.931
he'd call out her name- Wendy.

15:34.029 --> 15:36.829
And before her,
there was another cow.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.933
- Another cow?
- Queenlier.

15:41.035 --> 15:45.670
I never caught them,
but I saw the way he looked at her.

15:45.774 --> 15:48.439
And he would call out her name too...

15:48.543 --> 15:52.644
and then tee to cover
by saying I was his queen.

15:52.748 --> 15:55.275
This marriage is not real...

15:57.385 --> 16:00.289
and it hurts.

16:03.591 --> 16:06.962
Mr. Biddle, I need to hear from you.

16:07.062 --> 16:09.396
Why?

16:09.497 --> 16:11.798
Because I do. It's shocking.

16:11.901 --> 16:16.809
Tomorrow you will sit in that
witness chair and tell me why...

16:16.906 --> 16:20.208
I shouldn't annul this union
you've so disgraced.

16:26.514 --> 16:30.477
See, if you request another lawyer,
the judge then-

16:30.585 --> 16:32.988
I isn’t requesting' nothing'.

16:33.088 --> 16:35.058
You have to. We don't get along.

16:35.156 --> 16:38.891
I like you just fine.
You're a big lawyer with big suck.

16:38.995 --> 16:41.124
You’re just what I need.

16:41.229 --> 16:45.363
Look, I can't bring myself to defend a man
who killed a 13-year-old girl.

16:45.467 --> 16:48.736
Oh, come on, man.
Probably did her a favor.

16:51.674 --> 16:54.110
- What did you say?
- I got Al DS, Denny Crane.

16:54.209 --> 16:57.705
She could've had a lot of suffering ahead
'cause I really went to town.

16:57.813 --> 16:59.840
You know what I mean?

16:59.949 --> 17:01.943
She's probably lucky I ended it quick.

17:05.855 --> 17:09.386
If you really have Al DS, there could be other
psychological defenses available to us.

17:09.492 --> 17:12.760
- Yeah.
- Like, uh, traumatic distress.

17:12.862 --> 17:14.525
- Insanity perhaps.
- Mm-hmm.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.193
- On the other hand-
- What the-

17:17.299 --> 17:19.029
It was an accident.

17:19.134 --> 17:20.898
- Topside.
- Freeze! Drop it!

17:21.002 --> 17:23.065
He came at me. I feared for my life.

17:25.473 --> 17:27.376
He should probably get new counsel.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.837
Thank you.

18:04.146 --> 18:06.617
When's the arraignment?

18:06.716 --> 18:08.777
Paul's tying to head it off.

18:13.090 --> 18:14.992
Hmm.

18:17.427 --> 18:19.328
Denny, for God's sake.

18:19.428 --> 18:23.893
You know, Alan, I'm old...

18:25.836 --> 18:28.967
and I'm not going to spend
what time I have left...

18:29.072 --> 18:31.134
not even a day...

18:31.241 --> 18:35.875
defending child rapist killers.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.573
I'd rather go to jail myself.

18:41.718 --> 18:44.086
I hear you’re afraid of clowns.

18:48.324 --> 18:51.491
First time in my professional career
I actually froze.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.866
What happened?

18:58.335 --> 19:00.669
When I was three years old...

19:00.770 --> 19:04.436
my mother put
some decorative, hideous...

19:04.541 --> 19:06.909
clown face in my room.

19:07.011 --> 19:10.039
It so terrified me...

19:10.148 --> 19:12.118
I'd wet my bed...

19:12.215 --> 19:16.212
too afraid to pass him
on the way to the bathroom.

19:16.319 --> 19:20.282
When I was eight,
I was again terrorized...

19:20.390 --> 19:22.724
by a clown at the parade-

19:22.826 --> 19:24.796
the very same face.

19:26.964 --> 19:29.298
I wet myself right there in the street.

19:29.399 --> 19:34.398
And today, the same face again.

19:35.806 --> 19:37.775
I didn't dare get up for fear...

19:37.874 --> 19:41.314
I'd leave a puddle
right in the courtroom.

19:44.281 --> 19:46.912
You do have issues, don’t you?

19:49.553 --> 19:52.719
Denny, this is serious.

19:52.823 --> 19:55.886
You could be looking
at real jail time.

20:05.670 --> 20:09.302
- Dwight, have you sought professional help?
- Yes.

20:09.406 --> 20:14.007
My therapist, he said
the genesis of my infatuation...

20:14.111 --> 20:18.779
could've been the unconditional
adoration and acceptance I get from-

20:18.883 --> 20:20.978
- Wendy.
- Yes.

20:21.085 --> 20:24.216
And didn't your therapist also tell you...

20:24.321 --> 20:26.622
your love for your wife Jeanie
is in play here?

20:26.724 --> 20:29.525
- Yes.
- Could you elaborate?

20:31.629 --> 20:35.501
Well, Jeanie looks a little like a cow.

20:37.535 --> 20:41.373
You see? I fell in love with Wendy
because she reminded me of you.

20:49.447 --> 20:53.181
I won't insult you, Scott,
by condoning Denny's actions.

20:53.283 --> 20:55.880
- Self-defense.
- But a district attorney-

20:55.987 --> 20:57.980
And I know you know this
because I taught you.

20:58.089 --> 21:00.219
A district attorney
should not bring a case...

21:00.324 --> 21:02.886
when he lacks
a good-faith belief of conviction.

21:02.994 --> 21:05.693
- Zero.
- Even if you could refute self-defense-

21:05.796 --> 21:09.236
- Can't.
- nonjury is going to convict him of wounding a man...

21:09.333 --> 21:11.826
who raped and strangled
a 13-year-old girl.

21:11.936 --> 21:14.237
What message are you
asking me to send, Paul?

21:14.338 --> 21:17.071
If crime is popular enough,
don't prosecute?

21:17.175 --> 21:19.475
You haven't got evidence.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.378
It's Denny's word
against the child rapist's.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.215
- Feared for my life.
- And since you broached the topic of popularity...

21:26.317 --> 21:30.052
you want to make attorney general, Scott.

21:30.155 --> 21:32.591
One needs public support
to accomplish that.

21:32.690 --> 21:37.029
How popular do you think you'll be
if you prosecute Denny Crane?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.688
Denny Crane.

21:43.034 --> 21:45.666
It's a children's show, for God's sake.

21:45.771 --> 21:49.711
He's a clown, and he's waxing on
about the end of the world.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.110
- Did you talk to him?
- Overhand overhand over.

21:53.211 --> 21:56.581
He said he had a social responsibility.

21:56.681 --> 21:59.779
My God, we had viewers clicking over
to Aaron Brown for a laugh.

21:59.885 --> 22:02.515
Our show became preachy, unfunny.

22:02.620 --> 22:06.526
Ratings started to reflect it,
and we simply had to get a new clown.

22:06.624 --> 22:09.256
Zoo talked about 9/11?

22:09.361 --> 22:11.763
- Yes, to help children cope.
- The Columbine shootings?

22:11.863 --> 22:14.835
Many times he discussed
tragic current events.

22:14.933 --> 22:18.030
So, you're firing him for discussing
serious subject matter...

22:18.136 --> 22:20.801
when he's done so in the past
with your approval?

22:20.906 --> 22:24.971
There is a line. Telling our viewers the planet
is about to become extinct crosses it.

22:25.077 --> 22:29.246
After he told the kids
to ask their parents about hybrid cars...

22:29.349 --> 22:31.318
that's when he got fired, wasn't it?

22:31.416 --> 22:34.820
- This has nothing to do with-
- WKNW is owned by an oil and gas company.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.413
Nothing to do with our parent company.

22:37.521 --> 22:40.460
He wasn't funny.
We needed a funny clown.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.899
How's it going?

22:57.008 --> 23:00.948
I'm sitting here trying to come up
with a closing to defend bestiality.

23:01.046 --> 23:05.954
- That's how it's going.
- You don't have to defend it so much as-

23:06.051 --> 23:08.683
- What's this?
- Research.

23:08.788 --> 23:14.095
Do you realize that studies show
1 OM to 30M of sexually active adults...

23:14.193 --> 23:19.101
have fantasized or had some form
of encounter with an animal?

23:20.366 --> 23:22.461
Denise, I-

23:22.567 --> 23:25.266
A- Are we ready?

23:25.371 --> 23:28.002
All set.

23:28.107 --> 23:32.343
You don't have to treat me like a leper,
Shirley. I don't have a disease.

23:32.444 --> 23:37.614
Dwight, you're my friend, and I will
tee to stand by you through this...

23:37.717 --> 23:41.622
but let's not pretend you don't
have a serious illness.

23:41.720 --> 23:45.889
- There are worse things than loving an animal.
- Really? Name three.

23:45.992 --> 23:49.362
You know,
I was never going to tell you this.

23:49.461 --> 23:52.160
When you were 13
and your parents sent Bumpy away...

23:52.265 --> 23:56.831
it wasn't to some greener pasture
where he'd be happier, like they told you.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.236
Bumpy went to a slaughterhouse!

23:59.338 --> 24:02.333
And then he returned to your freezer!

24:02.442 --> 24:06.907
You ate him, Shirley.
So don't get so high and mighty with me.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.678
You ate your precious Bumpy!

24:21.560 --> 24:23.531
Why should I have to close?

24:23.629 --> 24:26.099
- Why should I have done everything else?
- Exactly.

24:26.199 --> 24:29.103
You've got a connection going that...

24:29.203 --> 24:31.696
I lack.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.835
Why are you afraid of clowns, really?

24:37.444 --> 24:40.610
Because they're evil.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.881
And it simply isn't right...

24:44.984 --> 24:49.756
for parents
to tell their children to just...

24:49.856 --> 24:51.792
trust them so.

24:54.961 --> 24:59.403
Did a clown ever...
do anything to you?

24:59.500 --> 25:01.264
No!

25:01.368 --> 25:04.204
They’re just... evil.

25:04.304 --> 25:08.108
Alan, you need to close.

25:08.208 --> 25:11.578
first, you have a better grip
on this whole global warming issue...

25:11.677 --> 25:13.374
which I tend to dismiss as-

25:13.480 --> 25:15.450
Fuzzy math.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.746
And second, at some point...

25:17.851 --> 25:20.822
every man-
even the half-evolved kind-

25:20.920 --> 25:23.483
needs to confront his fears.

25:23.589 --> 25:26.390
You need to stand up
and deliver this closing.

25:28.061 --> 25:31.728
Will the clown be there?

25:43.511 --> 25:46.141
look over here, sir!

25:46.246 --> 25:48.979
Animal rights activists
are obviously very upset...

25:49.082 --> 25:53.113
though it should be noted there is no
evidence that the cow ever complained.

25:53.220 --> 25:56.283
Your client's behavior
doesn't shock you, counsel?

25:56.390 --> 25:58.327
Of course it does.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.626
But sex with animals?
It's hardly a new concept.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.791
Greek literature is full obit.
So is art.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.861
Chagall, Picasso, Rembrandt-
they've all depicted it.

26:08.969 --> 26:11.999
To this day,
men still dream of mermaids.

26:12.106 --> 26:14.405
And what woman hasn't had a friend...

26:14.509 --> 26:17.276
with a half-man half-bull fantasy?

26:18.712 --> 26:21.114
Your Honor, I need you to listen.

26:21.214 --> 26:24.517
Look, if you intend
to romanticize the idea-

26:24.618 --> 26:27.351
Shakespeare already did that
in A Midsummer Night's Dream.

26:27.455 --> 26:30.723
So did Yeats in his famous poem,
"Leda and the Swan. "

26:30.824 --> 26:35.732
"How can these terrified,
vague fingers...

26:35.829 --> 26:39.792
push the feathered glory
from her loosened thighs?"

26:39.900 --> 26:41.996
- Lord love a duck.
- So did Leda.

26:42.103 --> 26:44.369
And who can forget
King Kong and fairway?

26:44.472 --> 26:46.533
And where did
Stuart Little come from?

26:46.641 --> 26:51.446
Sex with a cow is outrageous.
tat’s gross.

26:51.546 --> 26:54.677
And it's every bit as shocking
as the plaintiff contends...

26:54.781 --> 26:56.752
but it is not grounds for annulment.

26:56.851 --> 27:00.152
And if you suddenly declare that it is,
watch out...

27:00.253 --> 27:02.690
because there vowel may be
more of this out there...

27:02.790 --> 27:04.691
than any of us want to believe.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.028
He cheated on his wife.

27:10.130 --> 27:12.533
She's entitled to a divorce.

27:12.634 --> 27:16.439
But bestiality is not and never
has been grounds for annulment.

27:16.538 --> 27:21.104
By the way, in some states
it's not even expressly outlawed.

27:22.944 --> 27:28.216
Of course, she's humiliated
and feeling disgraced.

27:28.316 --> 27:32.553
But that doesn't change the fact-
they had a marriage.

27:50.038 --> 27:53.978
None of this is to say we believe
in Mr. Crane's innocence.

27:54.075 --> 27:56.205
We don't.
But we have to face reality.

27:56.311 --> 27:58.975
We lack a good-faith belief
of securing a conviction.

27:59.080 --> 28:02.417
We're therefore declining
to make an arrest at this time.

28:02.518 --> 28:05.422
Personally, I am disgusted
by his conduct...

28:05.521 --> 28:09.517
and I will report his actions
to the Board of Bar Overseers.

28:09.624 --> 28:11.993
The puts.

28:12.093 --> 28:14.656
- You ought to be happy.
- I'm not happy.

28:14.762 --> 28:17.825
- He insulted me on live television.
- You dodged a bullet, Denny.

28:17.932 --> 28:21.838
And took one right in the ass.
The puts.

28:21.936 --> 28:25.809
He had incorporated many
serious subjects into his programs...

28:25.908 --> 28:27.809
all with the station's approval.

28:27.909 --> 28:31.849
But when he moved on to global warming,
carbon dioxide pollution...

28:31.946 --> 28:34.041
he suddenly had to be stopped?

28:34.148 --> 28:37.485
Because he was suddenly less funny? No.

28:37.586 --> 28:41.151
Because the station
was owned by Glob co Oil.

28:41.256 --> 28:45.128
This discharge was wrongful.
It was in bad faith.

28:45.227 --> 28:50.671
My client has built this company's fortunes
for 13 years being Zoo.

28:50.766 --> 28:55.708
It is his livelihood. He's perhaps
the most popular clown in this county.

28:55.804 --> 29:01.213
And this court should issue a T. R. O.
to stop this outrageous travesty of justice.

29:28.137 --> 29:33.102
I could be wrong,
but a clown's main job is to be funny.

29:34.243 --> 29:36.213
Global warming is not.

29:36.311 --> 29:39.716
Your Honor, the arctic polar ice cap...

29:39.815 --> 29:43.151
is declining at the rate
of nine percent per decade.

29:43.252 --> 29:46.350
We're talking about a rising sea level...

29:46.456 --> 29:50.328
that could wipe out huge pieces
of the world's landmass.

29:50.426 --> 29:53.158
More importantly, us.

29:53.262 --> 29:56.702
Massachusetts, California,
our coastlines.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.270
That simply isn't funny...

29:59.369 --> 30:01.703
unless, of course, you live in Nevada.

30:01.805 --> 30:03.672
Don't get me wrong.

30:03.773 --> 30:07.041
Millions of Americans
go to sleep at night...

30:07.142 --> 30:09.910
praying that the nation's
number-one clown...

30:10.013 --> 30:13.850
will finally start caring
about global warming...

30:13.949 --> 30:16.420
but this is a children's
entertainment show.

30:16.519 --> 30:18.488
And let me ask you...

30:18.588 --> 30:23.393
if our own government is allowed
to edit and alter scientific findings...

30:23.493 --> 30:27.558
if it can control the information flow
on this subject...

30:27.664 --> 30:31.331
why then shouldn't
a private television station...

30:31.434 --> 30:33.529
get to enjoy that same freedom?

30:35.038 --> 30:37.941
You're a clown.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.241
Be funny.

30:42.779 --> 30:44.750
Global warming is not.

31:19.916 --> 31:23.856
In 3S years, Denny, I have never
forbidden you to do anything!

31:23.953 --> 31:27.016
- Don't start now.
- I will call the partners together right now!

31:27.123 --> 31:31.359
- What's going on?
- He'_ going on! Lary in.

31:31.461 --> 31:35.265
- What?
- Tonight. He's catching the 7:OO shuttle.

31:35.366 --> 31:38.429
- You can't be serious.
- Why does everybody insist I can't be serious?

31:38.535 --> 31:43.374
The district attorney
slathered me on live television.

31:43.474 --> 31:47.038
- I think you mean "slandered. "
- Well, I'll have the last word.

31:47.143 --> 31:48.806
Listen to me!

31:48.913 --> 31:52.477
They could still bring charges if you
say something to incriminate yourself.

31:52.582 --> 31:54.553
Give me some credit, will you, Paul?

31:54.652 --> 31:58.182
Credit? You shot out
your client's kneecaps!

31:58.289 --> 32:01.158
The public needs
to hear from Denny Crane!

32:03.092 --> 32:05.461
TiVo me, will you?

32:10.367 --> 32:13.031
Please God, have mercy.

32:16.139 --> 32:18.041
How could you not stop him?

32:18.142 --> 32:20.738
We tried to stop him.
We tried to get you to stop him.

32:20.844 --> 32:22.871
Larry King.

32:22.979 --> 32:25.974
Alan, judge is back with a ruling.
Let's go.

32:27.183 --> 32:29.051
- Tonight?
- Come on.

32:29.153 --> 32:32.318
Can’t you go by yourself?
It’s just a ruling.

32:32.423 --> 32:35.589
You're doing this.

32:41.765 --> 32:44.430
Disgusting.

32:44.535 --> 32:48.704
Regrettably, this fetish with animals may be
more prevalent than we'd like to think.

32:48.807 --> 32:51.437
And it's a slippery slope.

32:51.542 --> 32:56.211
Many women derive sexual pleasure
from riding on a horse. Sick.

32:56.313 --> 33:01.756
But we can’t just go around annulling marriages
every time Debbie goes for canter.

33:01.852 --> 33:03.720
Gross.

33:03.822 --> 33:06.952
I'm afraid your only legal recourse,
Mrs. Biddle...

33:07.057 --> 33:09.425
is divorce.

33:11.862 --> 33:13.856
Sick!

33:16.567 --> 33:19.300
We're adjourned.

33:23.073 --> 33:26.375
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

33:34.886 --> 33:37.414
I may have manifested
my love for you in ways...

33:37.522 --> 33:42.122
that brought you shame,
perhaps revulsion, but I do love you.

33:42.226 --> 33:46.166
And, uh, love is hard enough
to find, Jeanie...

33:46.263 --> 33:49.293
without attaching a lot of restrictions.

33:49.401 --> 33:51.894
"A lot of restrictions"?

33:52.003 --> 33:55.066
It's not like I set a lot of ground rules.

33:55.172 --> 34:00.274
But limiting yourself to a-
a single species is one of them.

34:00.378 --> 34:05.012
- Our species, Dwight.
- I broke it off. I'm going to get rid other.

34:05.115 --> 34:07.781
I think I'd like to sell the whole farm,
move to the city...

34:07.887 --> 34:11.518
outside offal temptation.

34:11.623 --> 34:14.254
- You broke it off?
- Yes.

34:14.359 --> 34:17.456
You're never going to see her again?

34:17.562 --> 34:19.532
I promise.

34:42.219 --> 34:44.190
We/combed_ to Larry King Live.

34:44.289 --> 34:47.659
And with me now is Denny Crane,
the legendary Boston attorney...

34:47.760 --> 34:49.855
who just yesterday...

34:49.962 --> 34:53.092
apparently opened fire
on his own client.

34:53.197 --> 34:55.725
- It was self-defense.
- You're kidding. Self-defense.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.465
You're not really asking people
to believe that.

34:58.571 --> 35:00.563
Larry, it's a crime to shoot people...

35:00.672 --> 35:04.875
even child-raping, murdering schmucks
like my client was and still is.

35:04.977 --> 35:09.851
Okay. But clearly, you're not saying if
defendant is repugnant enough, fair game...

35:09.949 --> 35:13.251
you're entitled as a criminal
defense attorney to shoot someone?

35:13.351 --> 35:15.583
- No, no, no, no, no. Self-defense.
- Come on.

35:15.687 --> 35:19.890
But even if did simply
choose to shoot him-

35:19.992 --> 35:23.260
which I didn't because
it's against the law- so what?

35:23.362 --> 35:27.234
- So what?
- Larry, you know what the real problem is?

35:27.333 --> 35:29.427
Too many criminals get away with it.

35:29.535 --> 35:33.498
We got hundreds of thousands
of unsolved murders in this county.

35:33.606 --> 35:38.070
So what you’re saying is it's okay for defense
lawyers to take the law into their own hands?

35:38.177 --> 35:40.305
No! Come on.

35:40.411 --> 35:45.376
You know what's going to happen
to this child rapist, murdering scum?

35:45.483 --> 35:47.954
Ashcroft- God bless him-
he's going to swoop in...

35:48.053 --> 35:48.053
and he's going to transfer this case to the federal
court so we can impose the death penalty.

35:51.690 --> 35:53.455
and he's going to transfer this case to the federal
court so we can impose the death penalty.

35:53.559 --> 35:57.021
Denny, Ashcroft is no longer
the attorney general.

35:57.130 --> 35:59.692
Well, whatever. The Spanish guy.

35:59.798 --> 36:02.497
Even better.

36:02.601 --> 36:06.302
My client's going to get the death penalty,
bad knees and all, 'cause he deserves it.

36:06.405 --> 36:09.468
Then all the bleeding liberals
and all of Hollow...

36:09.575 --> 36:13.208
will come running to defend him,
make him a cause célèbre.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.445
But who's crying
for the 13-year-old girl?

36:18.884 --> 36:21.789
The problem-
the criminal justice system.

36:21.888 --> 36:25.588
The criminals have more rights,
they have more attention...

36:25.691 --> 36:28.219
they get more sympathy
than the victims!

36:28.327 --> 36:30.320
It's disgusting, Larry.

36:30.429 --> 36:34.802
It's- It's- It's disgusting.

36:34.900 --> 36:39.342
Let's go to the listeners.
Hey, Donna in Cincinnati. What do you got?

36:42.541 --> 36:47.245
And while I find that the petitioner may
vowel have a legitimate cause olfaction...

36:47.346 --> 36:50.250
I don't find such a substantial
likelihood of victory...

36:50.349 --> 36:53.948
that would allow me to issue a T. R. O.

36:54.054 --> 36:56.252
Accordingly,
I find for the defendant.

36:56.356 --> 37:00.797
I wish you all good luck and
a satisfactory resolution. Adjourned.

37:00.894 --> 37:04.925
Oh, thank you both. That's a relief.

37:05.031 --> 37:08.265
- We're going to have to settle this.
- We will.

37:08.367 --> 37:11.340
- Okay then. Let's go home.
- Alan.

37:16.476 --> 37:19.447
You have to do this.
You're 44 years old.

37:24.383 --> 37:27.515
Tell him you're a fan.
Shake his hand.

37:29.122 --> 37:32.186
- Will you go with me?
- Right by your side.

37:47.407 --> 37:51.472
Uh, Mr. Zoo.

37:51.578 --> 37:53.309
I, uh-

37:53.413 --> 37:57.217
I just wanted to say...

37:57.317 --> 38:00.380
how much I've always enjoyed your work.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.480
Thank you.

38:04.024 --> 38:06.895
Would you like to squeeze my nose?

38:06.994 --> 38:09.863
No, no, no.
You've been more than kind.

38:09.964 --> 38:12.491
Alan.

38:17.271 --> 38:20.175
Well, per-
perhaps one little squeeze.

38:56.977 --> 38:58.947
You waited up for me.

38:59.046 --> 39:01.643
And I've been frantic.

39:01.749 --> 39:05.450
And you out at all hours.

39:05.553 --> 39:08.649
- Did you see the show?
- I did.

39:08.755 --> 39:10.726
You were inimitable.

39:13.794 --> 39:15.764
Denny, what possessed you?

39:18.565 --> 39:21.538
Everybody’s so convinced I lost it...

39:21.635 --> 39:24.471
I was becoming convinced myself.

39:24.572 --> 39:29.036
So I decided to sail right into it.
And I was Denny Crane.

39:29.143 --> 39:31.079
Yes, you were.

39:32.446 --> 39:36.318
- I squeezed a clown's nose tonight.
- Good for you.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.548
Guess we're never too old
to conquer our fears.

39:39.653 --> 39:42.921
I got a call from the Republican
National Party tonight.

39:43.023 --> 39:45.494
They think I might have
a future in politics.

39:45.593 --> 39:47.893
They want to put some feelers out.

39:47.995 --> 39:51.025
Maybe me running for mayor.

39:51.133 --> 39:54.664
- Of Boston?
- Mm-hmm.

39:56.537 --> 40:00.341
- We wouldn't get to be flamingos again.
- Of course we would.

40:00.441 --> 40:03.811
What would you do as mayor,
Denny, really?

40:03.911 --> 40:05.814
Oh, I don't know.

40:05.914 --> 40:09.979
I'd, uh, attack Rhode Island.

40:10.085 --> 40:12.647
It's small.

40:12.753 --> 40:17.058
What was the word you used
to describe me on the show tonight?

40:17.159 --> 40:19.288
- "Inimitable. "
- That's it.

40:19.394 --> 40:22.662
That's the kind of mayor I would be-
inimitable.

40:27.202 --> 40:29.969
It's fun being me.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.606
Is it fun being you?

40:34.709 --> 40:36.804
Most of the time, yes, actually.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.075
Well, what else is there?

40:40.615 --> 40:42.777
Indeed.

41:30.665 --> 41:32.224
You stinker!
