00:17.990 --> 00:22.157
(humming boat engine)
(splashing water)

00:28.070 --> 00:29.528
(thud)

00:29.528 --> 00:31.778
(rumbling)

00:40.068 --> 00:43.485
(dark atmospheric tones)

01:04.206 --> 01:06.457
(knocking)

01:16.791 --> 01:18.820
(tones intensify)

01:18.820 --> 01:21.320
(woman gasps)

01:25.580 --> 01:28.997
(dark atmospheric tones)

01:37.620 --> 01:40.370
(hissing rumble)

01:41.260 --> 01:42.770
(knocking)

01:42.770 --> 01:44.687
(thud)

01:46.111 --> 01:49.111
(suspenseful tones)

(suspenseful tones intensify)

02:27.383 --> 02:30.216
(splashing water)

02:37.689 --> 02:41.356
(abrasive electronic tones)

02:47.372 --> 02:50.872
(light atmospheric music)

03:11.205 --> 03:13.205
- I can't do this alone.

03:18.605 --> 03:22.702
- My mom is going batty in
that little house of hers.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.202
- I'm not moving to San Diego.

03:27.444 --> 03:29.444
I can't uproot the kids.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.710
Maybe this was just a bad idea
us moving back to the States.

03:37.964 --> 03:40.913
- Everything is gonna be all right.

03:40.913 --> 03:41.746
- A year.

03:44.143 --> 03:46.450
Afghanistan for a whole year.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.783
Let's just say something,
let's make something up.

03:48.783 --> 03:52.200
Let's say that you're
sick or, that I need you.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.033
Anything.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.441
Eat one, just one.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.652
Please?

04:02.652 --> 04:03.485
Just one.

04:04.943 --> 04:07.110
Can you eat yours, please?

04:08.172 --> 04:09.132
Excuse me!

04:09.132 --> 04:12.140
(muffled radio chatter)

04:12.140 --> 04:13.379
- Annie, I've been workin' my ass off

04:13.379 --> 04:15.897
here in this godforsaken desert.

04:15.897 --> 04:18.540
Any minute I can have my ass
blown off, and all you can

04:18.540 --> 04:22.391
talk about is how hard you've
got it watchin' the kids.

04:22.391 --> 04:24.540
- It's hard to do this alone,

04:24.540 --> 04:27.123
and did you just call me Annie?

05:00.204 --> 05:01.787
You're still alive.

05:43.271 --> 05:45.521
(clicking)

05:47.671 --> 05:48.513
(girl groans)

05:48.513 --> 05:50.780
Oh, you're such a big girl.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.313
Let's cuddle.

05:52.313 --> 05:54.563
Put lamby over us, come on.

05:57.414 --> 05:59.684
I'm scared too, baby.

05:59.684 --> 06:00.517
Come here.

06:02.094 --> 06:05.048
(dark atmospheric music)

06:05.048 --> 06:07.465
(man groans)

06:10.408 --> 06:12.810
(thud)

06:12.810 --> 06:15.227
(man groans)

06:37.304 --> 06:39.721
(man groans)

06:51.429 --> 06:52.274
(man groans)

06:52.274 --> 06:54.941
(ominous tones)

07:27.532 --> 07:29.282
- This is your fault.

07:32.601 --> 07:35.268
Oh, it's all your fucking fault.

07:53.955 --> 07:58.122
(swelling dark tones)
(rumbling)

08:17.102 --> 08:20.519
(dark atmospheric tones)

08:27.763 --> 08:29.846
(grunts)

08:31.124 --> 08:33.124
(pants)

08:39.960 --> 08:41.043
Oh, fuck off.

08:42.857 --> 08:44.775
I don't need this shit.

08:49.526 --> 08:52.693
(swelling dark tones)

08:54.701 --> 08:56.346
(abrasive music)

08:56.346 --> 08:58.840
Oh shit, who the hell are you?

08:58.840 --> 09:03.007
(thud)
(dark atmospheric music)

09:30.353 --> 09:32.452
- [Husband] Lexie, where the hell are you?

09:32.452 --> 09:35.652
I'm sitting here in front
of the base, all alone!

09:35.652 --> 09:38.440
My flight landed over two hours ago.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.433
Not a good time for one of
your disappearing acts, Lexie.

09:42.433 --> 09:46.183
Damnit, I just spent 22
hours on a transport.

09:48.092 --> 09:50.009
Guess I'm taking a cab.

09:52.913 --> 09:56.033
Any minute I can have my ass
blown off and all you can talk

09:56.033 --> 09:58.241
about is how hard you've
got it watchin' the kids.

09:58.241 --> 09:59.761
- [Lexie] Enough with
your war stories, Roy,

09:59.761 --> 10:00.833
you'll scare the kids.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.250
- [Roy] When did you lose respect for me?

10:19.338 --> 10:21.671
(whooshing)

10:26.120 --> 10:29.942
(suspenseful atmospheric music)

10:29.942 --> 10:32.275
(whooshing)

11:13.737 --> 11:14.570
- Shit.

11:45.608 --> 11:49.025
(dark atmospheric music)

12:15.133 --> 12:18.550
(warm atmospheric music)

12:31.592 --> 12:33.509
Fly away, little fella.

12:34.438 --> 12:38.605
There's nothing for you
here, go back to your family.

12:39.755 --> 12:42.588
(softly chuckles)

12:44.822 --> 12:47.989
(swelling dark tones)

12:52.833 --> 12:55.833
(suspenseful music)

13:14.933 --> 13:19.100
(birds tweeting)
(dark atmospheric tones)

13:27.422 --> 13:29.755
(whooshing)

13:44.351 --> 13:45.636
Roy, I'm at the house.

13:45.636 --> 13:46.791
What's going on?

13:46.791 --> 13:50.049
- [Roy] That San Diego job I
interviewed for last March?

13:50.049 --> 13:52.247
It finally came through,
we moved in with my mom.

13:52.247 --> 13:55.129
- No, you did not take--
- I'm the father.

13:55.129 --> 13:56.449
And I need to do what's best.

13:56.449 --> 13:58.639
- [Lexie] I know that you're
the father, but I'm the mother.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.918
- [Roy] I have sole custody, Lexie.

14:00.918 --> 14:01.837
- San Diego.

14:01.837 --> 14:04.317
How am I supposed to visit?

14:04.317 --> 14:08.100
(dark atmospheric tones)

14:08.100 --> 14:09.598
(phone chimes)

14:09.598 --> 14:11.940
Shit, my battery's about to go.

14:11.940 --> 14:13.516
Charger's in the apartment
and I'm locked out.

14:13.516 --> 14:15.831
- [Roy] Maybe if you
didn't stay out all night,

14:15.831 --> 14:17.471
every night.

14:17.471 --> 14:19.237
Where were you three days ago?

14:19.237 --> 14:21.460
- [Lexie] I had a problem with my car.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.591
- [Roy] I heard it was impounded.

14:24.591 --> 14:25.879
- [Lexie] I wasn't drunk.

14:25.879 --> 14:30.046
- [Roy] The rumor mill has a
not-so-cloudy recollection.

14:31.639 --> 14:35.056
(dark atmospheric music)

14:55.329 --> 14:58.162
(splashing water)

15:18.470 --> 15:19.303
- Shit.

15:28.390 --> 15:31.140
(sizzling flame)

15:36.838 --> 15:40.255
(dark atmospheric music)

15:54.171 --> 15:56.171
So what happened to you?

15:59.171 --> 16:02.640
Guess this bastard killed
you and I happened to

16:02.640 --> 16:05.807
stumble on him dumping you in the sea.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.634
I have all the luck.

16:23.479 --> 16:25.646
(gulping)

16:33.196 --> 16:35.529
We need to get to San Diego.

16:41.675 --> 16:42.887
(sniffs)

16:42.887 --> 16:44.304
I miss my babies.

16:50.523 --> 16:53.440
I don't know who I am without them.

16:55.457 --> 16:58.290
(muffled chatter)

16:59.181 --> 17:02.181
(suspenseful music)

17:18.954 --> 17:20.122
- Who are you?

17:22.865 --> 17:25.185
And what are you doin' on my boat?

17:25.185 --> 17:27.435
- Your boat said San Diego.

17:29.595 --> 17:33.025
- You're nowhere near San Diego, darlin'.

17:33.025 --> 17:37.185
- What happened to you in the
engine compartment yesterday?

17:37.185 --> 17:39.602
- Blew the electrical system.

17:42.744 --> 17:44.744
Nearly blew my head off.

17:46.905 --> 17:49.195
- There's a dead body,

17:49.195 --> 17:51.097
a woman down there.

17:51.097 --> 17:52.264
What the fuck?

18:05.231 --> 18:08.231
Why is there a dead body down there?

18:10.391 --> 18:11.808
- We're driftin'.

18:13.143 --> 18:15.726
Gonna run ashore in a few days.

18:18.551 --> 18:20.301
Or it could be weeks.

18:22.886 --> 18:26.053
- Why is there a dead body down there?

18:37.686 --> 18:40.686
Why is there a dead body down there?

18:43.782 --> 18:45.532
- Let me out of here.

18:46.936 --> 18:49.186
- Why is there a dead body?

18:57.678 --> 19:01.178
(suspenseful tones swell)

19:24.260 --> 19:25.427
- Look at you.

19:26.287 --> 19:29.329
The original good-time girl.

19:29.329 --> 19:32.412
- So I guess I stumbled across the...

19:33.609 --> 19:37.692
murder and dump the wife
in the ocean thing, huh?

19:41.649 --> 19:43.982
This really is my lucky day.

19:45.896 --> 19:47.668
- I'll call you Lady Bug.

19:47.668 --> 19:48.655
- What?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.689
- On your ankle.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.272
There, your tattoo.

19:53.689 --> 19:56.575
I bet there's a story behind that.

19:56.575 --> 19:57.492
- Whatever.

20:00.268 --> 20:01.185
- Lady Bug.

20:07.697 --> 20:10.030
- See his polka-dots on him?

20:11.489 --> 20:12.838
Let's go put him outside.

20:12.838 --> 20:16.338
- Okay, come on, let's go put him outside.

20:21.377 --> 20:22.794
- We're driftin'.

20:28.078 --> 20:30.747
- Even in the middle of the ocean,

20:30.747 --> 20:35.484
I find the only obnoxious
asshole to say the obvious.

20:35.484 --> 20:39.617
- We'll be down in Mexico in three days.

20:39.617 --> 20:42.564
Of course it could take a
month or so to drift down to

20:42.564 --> 20:43.731
South America.

20:44.726 --> 20:46.787
- If I have to stay on this
thing with you for a month,

20:46.787 --> 20:48.257
I'll kill myself.

20:48.257 --> 20:49.924
- Oh, don't do that.

20:50.964 --> 20:54.038
We're gonna have such a fun month.

20:54.038 --> 20:56.288
(chuckles)

20:58.078 --> 20:59.977
- I have all the luck.

20:59.977 --> 21:02.638
- Of course it is possible to
never hit the shore at all.

21:02.638 --> 21:04.603
Drift all the way around the great horn.

21:04.603 --> 21:06.718
So, you can untie me,

21:06.718 --> 21:09.484
or you can let out the anchor yourself.

21:09.484 --> 21:11.457
If you want to survive this.

21:11.457 --> 21:14.154
And, I'm guessing you do.

21:14.154 --> 21:16.487
- You wanna drop the anchor?

21:17.715 --> 21:20.267
Surely if we put down the
anchor, that would stop us

21:20.267 --> 21:22.517
from getting back to shore.

21:23.857 --> 21:26.515
I'm stupid but I am not that stupid.

21:26.515 --> 21:29.043
- You get too close to the shore,

21:29.043 --> 21:31.057
you could run aground.

21:31.057 --> 21:31.890
Rocks.

21:33.627 --> 21:35.555
You don't wanna hit 'em.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.217
Trust me.

21:37.217 --> 21:38.217
- Trust you.

21:43.113 --> 21:46.946
- Dragging anchor can
save your life at night.

21:52.377 --> 21:54.017
- Yeah.

21:54.017 --> 21:57.434
(dark atmospheric music)

22:07.945 --> 22:10.236
(moans)

22:10.236 --> 22:11.775
(yelps)

22:11.775 --> 22:14.775
(suspenseful music)

22:28.628 --> 22:29.461
Shit.

22:52.161 --> 22:56.328
(booming thunder)
(heavy rainfall and wind)

23:27.021 --> 23:29.188
- You can't leave me here.

23:30.803 --> 23:32.803
You can't leave me here!

23:35.341 --> 23:39.508
(suspenseful music)
(thunder and rainfall)

23:44.192 --> 23:46.192
You can't leave me here!

23:47.102 --> 23:47.935
Lady!

24:47.128 --> 24:50.711
(somber atmospheric music)

24:55.348 --> 24:58.181
(muffled chatter)

25:01.589 --> 25:03.177
- [Lexie] You got it, you got it.

25:03.177 --> 25:06.177
(children laughing)

25:17.461 --> 25:20.128
(swaying water)

25:34.023 --> 25:37.440
(dark suspenseful music)

25:53.441 --> 25:55.691
(cranking)

26:05.445 --> 26:06.871
- Hey, hey!

26:06.871 --> 26:09.121
(whirring)

26:19.052 --> 26:20.353
Woo!

26:20.353 --> 26:22.273
We got a big one!

26:22.273 --> 26:23.892
(cranking)

26:23.892 --> 26:25.142
Come on, honey!

26:26.121 --> 26:27.204
Come to papa!

26:30.292 --> 26:31.375
Hey, hey, ho!

26:32.520 --> 26:33.603
Tuna tonight!

26:38.481 --> 26:39.814
- How did you...

26:42.913 --> 26:44.812
- It's called fishing.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.312
- But you're free.

26:50.492 --> 26:53.909
(dark atmospheric music)

26:55.893 --> 26:58.060
(retches)

26:59.482 --> 27:01.565
(coughs)

27:05.947 --> 27:08.364
(man laughs)

27:30.750 --> 27:33.083
(loud thud)

27:35.771 --> 27:37.688
(thud)

27:43.177 --> 27:45.430
(thud)

27:45.430 --> 27:47.817
(thud)
(dark tones)

27:47.817 --> 27:52.459
(thuds)
(pants)

27:52.459 --> 27:56.626
(thuds and squelches)
(grunts)

27:58.720 --> 28:00.499
(gasps)

28:00.499 --> 28:04.666
(thuds and squelches)
(grunts)

28:09.792 --> 28:11.792
(sighs)

28:14.729 --> 28:16.729
(gasps)

28:37.659 --> 28:38.742
Where is she?

28:39.929 --> 28:41.561
- She?

28:41.561 --> 28:42.561
- Your wife.

28:43.718 --> 28:46.409
- What the hell are you talkin' about?

28:46.409 --> 28:47.659
- She was here.

28:49.718 --> 28:51.547
(man chuckles)

28:51.547 --> 28:54.130
- God damn, you can tie one on.

29:01.129 --> 29:03.796
(ominous tones)

29:10.162 --> 29:14.183
- Where's the brown stuff in the wrapper?

29:14.183 --> 29:16.583
- Must have washed away.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.833
Hell of a storm last night.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.600
- Where's the gun?

30:06.189 --> 30:08.772
(man chuckles)

30:15.471 --> 30:17.721
(knocking)

30:18.671 --> 30:20.471
- Why don't you come on up?

30:20.471 --> 30:23.471
You're gonna get seasick down there.

30:30.783 --> 30:31.616
Hello?

30:33.171 --> 30:34.754
You want some fish?

30:38.611 --> 30:40.851
You know, I got some gas
canisters down there.

30:40.851 --> 30:43.644
I need those for the barbecue,
could you bring those up?

30:43.644 --> 30:46.477
Come on, it's too early for sushi.

31:02.213 --> 31:06.225
(dark atmospheric music)

31:06.225 --> 31:07.808
I have a big mouth.

31:10.975 --> 31:13.058
But I can't talk anymore!

32:06.396 --> 32:07.508
Are you still in there?

32:07.508 --> 32:10.175
(hissing flame)

32:11.889 --> 32:16.056
I hope you don't think you
can hide in there forever.

32:19.122 --> 32:20.455
I have the keys.

32:21.554 --> 32:25.167
Not like I can't open
the door at any time.

32:25.167 --> 32:26.167
Come on out.

32:27.348 --> 32:28.598
Not gonna bite.

32:39.567 --> 32:42.150
(music swells)

33:26.443 --> 33:29.443
(suspenseful music)

34:05.959 --> 34:08.542
(music swells)

34:17.552 --> 34:18.935
Can I help you with something?

34:18.935 --> 34:21.435
(Lexie gasps)

34:22.681 --> 34:25.264
(Lexie grunts)

34:26.620 --> 34:28.620
(pants)

34:37.735 --> 34:40.687
Hey, what's goin' on here?

34:40.687 --> 34:43.975
What'd you do with all my stuff?

34:43.975 --> 34:45.391
- Where's my gun?

34:46.567 --> 34:48.174
- Gun?

34:48.174 --> 34:50.677
- The gun that I had in my bag!

34:50.677 --> 34:51.967
- (Laughs) I don't know.

34:51.967 --> 34:54.626
You're pretty strung out, lady.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.793
You sure you even had one?

35:12.407 --> 35:14.990
(music swells)

35:29.500 --> 35:34.188
(dark atmospheric music)
(son singing)

35:34.188 --> 35:35.021
- Hi, Mom.

35:37.365 --> 35:40.397
♫ Lady bug, lady bug

35:40.397 --> 35:43.064
♫ Fly away home

35:51.860 --> 35:53.777
Good morning, Lady Bug.

35:56.810 --> 35:58.393
So what's the plan?

35:59.631 --> 36:01.964
Why'd you take all my stuff?

36:02.940 --> 36:07.311
- Just jump off the boat
and get out of my life.

36:07.311 --> 36:09.220
(man chuckles)

36:09.220 --> 36:12.277
- [Man] Someone woke up in
a bad mood this morning.

36:12.277 --> 36:14.944
- No, I just want off this boat!

36:15.839 --> 36:17.839
(thuds)

36:19.191 --> 36:21.940
- [Man] Did you hear that?

36:21.940 --> 36:24.610
That's the sound of Plexiglas.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.871
If I step on this,

36:26.871 --> 36:27.871
it'll break.

36:33.517 --> 36:35.650
(laughs)

36:35.650 --> 36:38.071
(ominous chord)

36:38.071 --> 36:40.821
(Lexie whimpers)

36:42.791 --> 36:45.791
(suspenseful tones)

36:47.357 --> 36:49.530
(slow footsteps)

36:49.530 --> 36:51.397
(Lexie whimpers)

36:51.397 --> 36:53.717
(slow footsteps)

36:53.717 --> 36:56.717
(suspenseful tones)

37:13.832 --> 37:16.165
(crackling)

37:22.129 --> 37:25.129
- [Son] Bye bye, I'm going to sleep.

37:33.976 --> 37:37.393
(dark atmospheric music)

38:05.330 --> 38:07.733
- Good morning, sunshine.

38:07.733 --> 38:10.733
(suspenseful tones)

38:16.738 --> 38:18.155
What's the point?

38:21.328 --> 38:23.728
I'm not gonna hurt you.

38:23.728 --> 38:26.506
- I don't want to end up a
dead woman in a body bag.

38:26.506 --> 38:30.957
- Look, we're in a really
horrible situation here.

38:30.957 --> 38:35.124
There's no reason that we
can't keep each other company.

38:39.738 --> 38:41.826
- I need a drink.

38:41.826 --> 38:45.159
- Looks like you need more than a drink.

38:48.448 --> 38:49.281
Truce?

38:50.626 --> 38:53.378
(Lexie chuckles)

38:53.378 --> 38:57.488
- This is always gonna
end badly anyway, so...

38:57.488 --> 38:58.321
Why not?

39:04.225 --> 39:06.475
I am not shaking your hand.

39:12.066 --> 39:14.566
- [Man] All right, I'm all in.

39:19.044 --> 39:21.711
- Well my pot seems to be empty.

39:23.204 --> 39:26.037
- This is the part where you fold.

39:29.306 --> 39:31.973
- Or I could bet something else.

39:36.352 --> 39:39.554
- There's nothing else left to bet.

39:39.554 --> 39:42.994
Nothing else in that tackle box.

39:42.994 --> 39:47.161
Unless of course, you wanna
go with our usual bet.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.154
- Usual bet?

39:54.272 --> 39:55.272
- Usual bet.

40:00.004 --> 40:04.171
- But how can we have a usual
bet? This is our first bet.

40:05.325 --> 40:07.473
(man chuckles)

40:07.473 --> 40:09.056
- You are bluffing.

40:12.452 --> 40:16.619
- Fine, I'm just gonna go
with this, our usual bet.

40:21.173 --> 40:22.006
- I call.

40:24.445 --> 40:25.528
A full house.

40:26.395 --> 40:27.228
Beat that.

40:36.294 --> 40:37.711
- A pair of aces.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.254
(man laughs)

40:43.626 --> 40:47.043
- I am the man! (laughs)

40:48.557 --> 40:52.854
All right, I'll be collecting
on my winnings now.

40:52.854 --> 40:54.021
- Down, pooch.

40:55.494 --> 40:58.414
I might not be very
good at this game, but,

40:58.414 --> 40:59.747
I am guessing...

41:05.174 --> 41:09.341
My full house is a little
fuller than your full house?

41:13.557 --> 41:16.557
(suspenseful music)

41:24.734 --> 41:27.067
- You're a hard one to read.

41:32.282 --> 41:33.115
Fuck.

41:34.444 --> 41:35.861
God, I never win.

41:38.244 --> 41:40.436
Why can't you let me win one hand?

41:40.436 --> 41:43.775
One!
(dark suspenseful music)

41:43.775 --> 41:46.525
(Lexie whimpers)

41:50.923 --> 41:52.324
Shit.

41:52.324 --> 41:54.157
Shit, I'm sorry, baby.

41:55.084 --> 41:59.251
I promised I wasn't gonna, I
wasn't gonna do that again.

42:00.682 --> 42:03.015
I wasn't gonna do this shit.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.444
I'm sorry.

42:05.444 --> 42:09.611
I just get a little stressed! (chuckles)

42:15.931 --> 42:17.931
(pants)

42:20.313 --> 42:21.896
- I am really cold.

42:27.262 --> 42:29.179
I can't stop shivering.

42:39.469 --> 42:40.719
I need a drink.

42:43.296 --> 42:45.879
Oh, your sister's crying again.

42:47.003 --> 42:47.836
- Yeah.

42:48.996 --> 42:50.713
- [Lexie] She cries a lot, huh?

42:50.713 --> 42:53.380
- Yeah because you make her sad.

42:55.276 --> 42:57.615
- [Lexie] Did I make her sad?

42:57.615 --> 42:58.448
- Yeah.

42:58.448 --> 42:59.975
- [Lexie] Do I make you sad?

42:59.975 --> 43:00.808
- Yeah.

43:00.808 --> 43:01.916
- I do?
- Mm-hm.

43:01.916 --> 43:06.083
(Lexie panting)
(dark atmospheric music)

43:07.242 --> 43:10.825
(Lexie whines and shivers)

43:21.275 --> 43:24.126
- [Lexie] I can't do this alone.

43:24.126 --> 43:25.286
- [Roy] Annie, I've
been working my ass off

43:25.286 --> 43:26.474
here in this godforsaken desert.

43:26.474 --> 43:27.817
- [Lexie] Enough with
your war stories, Roy,

43:27.817 --> 43:28.886
you'll scare the kids.

43:28.886 --> 43:32.303
- [Roy] When did you lose respect for me?

43:38.835 --> 43:42.252
(dark atmospheric tones)

44:33.662 --> 44:36.662
(suspenseful music)

45:14.519 --> 45:16.338
(music intensifies and swells)

45:16.338 --> 45:20.505
(splashing)
(dark atmospheric tones)

45:31.085 --> 45:33.085
(gasps)

45:34.851 --> 45:36.851
(pants)

45:42.199 --> 45:44.159
- What are you doing?

45:44.159 --> 45:46.326
- I was a terrible mother.

45:49.007 --> 45:50.365
- So what?

45:50.365 --> 45:54.532
You're just gonna drink and
smoke yourself to death then?

45:56.567 --> 45:58.245
- I might as well just
let some razor-toothed

45:58.245 --> 45:59.578
predator eat me.

46:13.084 --> 46:17.084
(suspenseful atmospheric music)

46:20.440 --> 46:23.023
(music swells)

46:24.167 --> 46:25.500
- Suit yourself!

46:28.350 --> 46:31.350
(suspenseful music)

46:40.724 --> 46:43.057
(whooshing)

46:50.814 --> 46:53.814
(suspenseful music)

47:05.104 --> 47:06.435
- I can't do this alone.

47:06.435 --> 47:10.458
- Been working my ass off
in this godforsaken desert.

47:10.458 --> 47:12.660
- [Lexie] It's hard to do this alone.

47:12.660 --> 47:13.951
And did you just call me Annie?

47:13.951 --> 47:15.201
- [Roy] When did you lose respect for me?

47:15.201 --> 47:17.848
(overlapping cross-chatter)

47:17.848 --> 47:20.161
Ass blown off and all you can talk about

47:20.161 --> 47:21.915
is how hard you've got
it watchin' the kids.

47:21.915 --> 47:25.429
(child crying)
(suspenseful music)

47:25.429 --> 47:26.818
- Throw me the rope!

47:26.818 --> 47:28.318
Throw me the rope!

47:30.989 --> 47:33.156
(screams)

47:39.840 --> 47:41.360
Throw me the rope!

47:41.360 --> 47:44.360
(suspenseful music)

47:47.400 --> 47:49.483
(whines)

47:52.810 --> 47:55.643
(gasps and pants)

48:00.044 --> 48:03.271
(gasps and pants)
(suspenseful music)

48:03.271 --> 48:04.771
Throw me the rope!

48:29.725 --> 48:31.235
(pants)

48:31.235 --> 48:34.823
Chivalry is dead, just like your wife.

48:34.823 --> 48:36.593
(pants)

48:36.593 --> 48:37.426
- Baby.

48:40.193 --> 48:43.033
- Thanks for all the help.

48:43.033 --> 48:45.513
- I'm impressed, baby, you're
stronger than I thought.

48:45.513 --> 48:47.680
- Stronger than I thought.

48:49.335 --> 48:52.502
- You always have been a good swimmer.

48:54.135 --> 48:58.844
- How do you know, and why
do you keep calling me baby?

48:58.844 --> 49:02.364
- I've been callin' you
baby since our, our,

49:02.364 --> 49:05.031
second, wait no, our third date.

49:06.151 --> 49:06.984
- Date?

49:08.865 --> 49:09.698
What date?

49:11.213 --> 49:12.046
- Oh.

49:17.156 --> 49:19.323
(squelch)

49:20.415 --> 49:21.332
Yeah, look.

49:22.167 --> 49:24.905
Time goes by, we get caught up.

49:24.905 --> 49:26.573
You know what?

49:26.573 --> 49:30.740
Maybe gettin' stuck out here
is the best thing for us.

49:33.855 --> 49:34.688
- Us?

49:38.865 --> 49:42.032
- I know I haven't been myself lately.

49:45.386 --> 49:48.287
- Honestly, having literally just met you,

49:48.287 --> 49:51.346
I think you're as crazy as ever.

49:51.346 --> 49:52.179
- Baby...

49:53.826 --> 49:54.659
Brit.

49:56.647 --> 49:57.730
I can change.

49:58.654 --> 49:59.571
You'll see.

50:01.487 --> 50:03.154
When they find us...

50:04.706 --> 50:06.623
I'm gonna be a new man.

50:08.847 --> 50:12.264
(dark atmospheric tones)

50:33.212 --> 50:35.645
I need a picture for my
collection. (chuckles)

50:35.645 --> 50:38.228
(Lexie groans)

50:46.478 --> 50:48.240
(camera whirs and clicks)

50:48.240 --> 50:50.740
(Lexie moans)

50:52.947 --> 50:54.907
We're gonna get through this, honey.

50:54.907 --> 50:58.574
Don't worry, I'm gonna
figure somethin' out.

50:59.957 --> 51:02.707
We need to spark up the barbecue.

51:06.278 --> 51:08.611
(whooshing)

51:13.243 --> 51:15.660
(dark tones)

51:34.177 --> 51:37.594
(swelling ominous tones)

51:56.007 --> 51:59.424
(dark atmospheric music)

52:16.455 --> 52:19.622
Let's pretend we're on our first date.

52:20.992 --> 52:25.114
What kind of music do
you like to listen to?

52:25.114 --> 52:26.632
- What?

52:26.632 --> 52:29.272
- Come on, it's just a game.

52:29.272 --> 52:31.085
Our first date.

52:31.085 --> 52:33.085
- What did you do?

52:33.085 --> 52:35.346
Dump her in the sea when I was passed out?

52:35.346 --> 52:38.874
- Dump who?
- The woman downstairs.

52:38.874 --> 52:41.525
- What happens to women after
they get out of college, huh?

52:41.525 --> 52:43.706
Do they all just go crazy?

52:43.706 --> 52:44.794
(Lexie chuckles)

52:44.794 --> 52:45.627
- Crazy.

52:46.912 --> 52:51.626
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately?

52:51.626 --> 52:54.205
- Women are crazy depressed.

52:54.205 --> 52:55.205
- Depressed.

52:56.386 --> 52:57.793
- Yeah.

52:57.793 --> 53:00.293
The way you medicate yourself.

53:02.352 --> 53:04.185
- And men are perfect.

53:05.895 --> 53:07.728
I'm not getting older.

53:08.586 --> 53:11.455
I'm just getting a younger wife.

53:11.455 --> 53:14.192
- I don't want a younger wife, baby.

53:14.192 --> 53:15.525
I just want you.

53:16.655 --> 53:19.895
We've just been goin'
through a rough patch lately.

53:19.895 --> 53:23.295
I mean, we'll muddle through it, right?

53:23.295 --> 53:24.128
- Wow.

53:27.085 --> 53:29.005
- Must be the hormones.

53:29.005 --> 53:30.026
(chuckles)

53:30.026 --> 53:31.432
Yeah.

53:31.432 --> 53:36.274
Women's hormones mess with
their ability to reason.

53:36.274 --> 53:38.107
- Reason with me this.

53:40.346 --> 53:41.596
Man has it all.

53:43.815 --> 53:45.232
The hottest wife.

53:47.015 --> 53:49.765
She sees him as her one and only.

53:51.845 --> 53:54.595
They have two beautiful children.

53:57.685 --> 54:00.352
Then he goes off to Afghanistan.

54:04.313 --> 54:07.455
A glass of wine takes the edge off.

54:07.455 --> 54:10.288
God, I was so scared and so lonely

54:11.165 --> 54:13.975
and the kids, they don't go to bed,

54:13.975 --> 54:17.808
so before you know it,
it's a bottle of vodka.

54:21.135 --> 54:21.968
So scared.

54:24.626 --> 54:26.126
You have the kids,

54:27.495 --> 54:29.912
then you don't have the kids.

54:30.925 --> 54:33.342
It's just a little pin prick,

54:34.215 --> 54:36.298
and nothing else matters.

55:11.039 --> 55:14.767
- [Daughter] Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

55:14.767 --> 55:15.600
Mommy!

55:17.647 --> 55:18.897
Wake up, Mommy.

55:27.772 --> 55:30.111
(dark suspenseful music)

55:30.111 --> 55:33.194
(man groans lightly)

55:53.038 --> 55:55.621
(music swells)

56:14.185 --> 56:17.505
- Let's play a different game.

56:17.505 --> 56:19.838
Do you know what I wish for?

56:21.699 --> 56:23.465
(dark tones)

56:23.465 --> 56:24.465
A hamburger.

56:26.019 --> 56:26.852
Oh.

56:27.739 --> 56:31.906
What I would give for a
hamburger and fries right now.

56:49.690 --> 56:52.607
I wish anything would fly overhead.

57:00.829 --> 57:01.912
I'm so tired.

57:06.173 --> 57:09.423
I think I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.

57:15.157 --> 57:18.157
(suspenseful music)

57:57.248 --> 57:59.331
(groans)

58:06.243 --> 58:08.660
(dark tones)

58:21.863 --> 58:23.946
(groans)

58:26.202 --> 58:27.063
(whines)

58:27.063 --> 58:29.480
(dark tones)

58:32.441 --> 58:35.441
(suspenseful music)

58:39.778 --> 58:41.861
(groans)

58:43.050 --> 58:45.133
(groans)

58:46.738 --> 58:50.155
(dark atmospheric music)

59:04.255 --> 59:07.186
(dark tones)

59:07.186 --> 59:10.269
(man groans lightly)

59:15.918 --> 59:18.335
(man snarls)

59:21.742 --> 59:24.492
(sinister music)

59:29.963 --> 59:32.546
(man whimpers)

59:47.103 --> 59:50.686
(somber atmospheric music)

01:00:53.006 --> 01:00:54.673
- Because it wasn't.

01:00:55.513 --> 01:00:57.596
(snarls)

01:01:01.665 --> 01:01:04.665
(suspenseful music)

01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:19.261
Okay, shut up.

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.629
(ominous music)

01:02:16.678 --> 01:02:17.678
- Am I next?

01:02:19.538 --> 01:02:22.538
(music intensifies)

01:02:25.511 --> 01:02:28.019
(music swells)

01:02:28.019 --> 01:02:30.436
(man groans)

01:02:32.059 --> 01:02:34.226
(screams)

01:02:35.706 --> 01:02:38.373
(intense music)

01:02:46.078 --> 01:02:48.121
(music swells)

01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:50.621
(man screams)

01:02:51.772 --> 01:02:54.439
(intense music)

01:02:56.768 --> 01:03:00.935
(squelching)
(man groans)

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:11.766
(thud)

01:03:11.766 --> 01:03:13.718
(thud)

01:03:13.718 --> 01:03:17.718
(grunts)
(thud)

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:22.614
(thud)

01:03:24.106 --> 01:03:26.773
(intense music)

01:03:29.998 --> 01:03:32.478
(thud)

01:03:32.478 --> 01:03:35.061
(music swells)

01:03:36.577 --> 01:03:39.994
(dark atmospheric music)

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:09.000
No.

01:04:10.224 --> 01:04:11.057
Help!

01:04:12.658 --> 01:04:13.491
Help!

01:04:15.266 --> 01:04:16.099
Anybody!

01:04:19.316 --> 01:04:20.944
Please.

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:21.861
Help, help!

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:25.960
Help!

01:04:28.076 --> 01:04:28.909
Come back.

01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:31.771
Come back.

01:04:34.378 --> 01:04:35.424
Stop.

01:04:35.424 --> 01:04:36.924
Over here, please!

01:04:40.465 --> 01:04:41.298
Please.

01:04:42.315 --> 01:04:43.148
Come back.

01:04:44.396 --> 01:04:45.896
Come back, please!

01:04:49.858 --> 01:04:50.691
No.

01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:08.598
(dark atmospheric music)

01:05:48.715 --> 01:05:52.715
(suspenseful atmospheric music)

01:06:40.508 --> 01:06:44.258
(swelling atmospheric tones)

01:06:54.882 --> 01:06:55.715
- Water.

01:07:05.866 --> 01:07:08.427
I'd even settle for one of
your psychedelic water bottles

01:07:08.427 --> 01:07:09.260
right now.

01:07:25.729 --> 01:07:28.146
(Lexie gags)

01:07:39.475 --> 01:07:40.892
- Desalinization.

01:07:42.704 --> 01:07:43.755
- What's that?

01:07:43.755 --> 01:07:47.094
- It's what makes salt water drinkable.

01:07:47.094 --> 01:07:50.875
Fill up that tin pan
with water and put it,

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:52.792
put it on the barbecue.

01:07:54.795 --> 01:07:58.378
Capture the condensation
with the tin foil.

01:08:02.334 --> 01:08:05.334
Then you'll be able to drink it.

01:08:05.334 --> 01:08:09.814
- And you've had this
the whole fucking time?

01:08:09.814 --> 01:08:12.564
- I didn't know you were thirsty.

01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:18.386
(Lexie gasps)

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.554
- It's a fish!

01:08:21.307 --> 01:08:22.969
- Good, good.

01:08:22.969 --> 01:08:24.386
Let the line run.

01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:28.459
Don't let it out too much, though.

01:08:28.459 --> 01:08:29.546
- Wait.

01:08:29.546 --> 01:08:30.738
What?

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:32.129
- Keep the tension on it.

01:08:32.129 --> 01:08:35.129
- So I, I let it out or keep it tight?

01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:36.879
- Just don't lose it!

01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:39.122
- Okay.

01:08:44.618 --> 01:08:45.452
- Good.

01:08:45.452 --> 01:08:48.868
Good, now drop it over here on the table.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.506
(chuckles)

01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:54.090
- [Lexie] I did it.

01:08:55.386 --> 01:08:57.187
- Now get the bat.

01:08:57.187 --> 01:08:58.020
- What?

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.335
- Are you hungry?

01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:03.420
- Yes.

01:09:04.747 --> 01:09:05.913
- Get the bat.

01:09:07.339 --> 01:09:09.006
You have to kill it.

01:09:10.587 --> 01:09:13.466
- No, I, I can't kill it.

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:15.358
- Are you hungry?

01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:16.191
- Yes.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.386
- Are you hungry?
- Aren't you hungry?

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:22.147
Aren't you hungry?

01:09:22.147 --> 01:09:25.147
(melancholic music)

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.897
Megan, your mommy tells me
that you won't eat your fish.

01:09:29.897 --> 01:09:30.897
Aren't you hungry?

01:09:30.897 --> 01:09:32.216
- Oh, no.

01:09:32.216 --> 01:09:33.845
- [Lexie] No, I'm just
gonna call you later.

01:09:33.845 --> 01:09:34.845
- No.

01:09:34.845 --> 01:09:36.514
You're not gonna call me later.

01:09:36.514 --> 01:09:38.228
This is how we're going
to have to do this.

01:09:38.228 --> 01:09:40.435
- Can you stop that?

01:09:40.435 --> 01:09:43.442
- Megan, you're eating what
your mommy fixed tonight,

01:09:43.442 --> 01:09:44.948
and that's fish.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.746
- I'm gonna ask you one
more time really nicely.

01:09:46.746 --> 01:09:48.408
Can you please eat your fish?

01:09:48.408 --> 01:09:49.242
- No.

01:09:50.268 --> 01:09:52.627
- I can't do this anymore.
- Lexie, you're there.

01:09:52.627 --> 01:09:54.849
You need to step up
and deal with the kids.

01:09:54.849 --> 01:09:57.369
(Megan sobbing)

01:09:57.369 --> 01:09:58.202
- Okay.

01:09:58.202 --> 01:10:01.537
Can you eat that please?
(Megan sobs)

01:10:01.537 --> 01:10:03.246
Okay, right!

01:10:03.246 --> 01:10:05.236
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

01:10:05.236 --> 01:10:07.736
(Megan wails)

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:10.857
This is what we're eating.

01:10:10.857 --> 01:10:13.857
(melancholic music)

01:10:21.595 --> 01:10:24.527
About a year ago I lost my job.

01:10:24.527 --> 01:10:27.527
My husband was in the military.

01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:29.357
When he came out, there
was no work for him

01:10:29.357 --> 01:10:31.774
so he started doing odd jobs.

01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:35.807
I needed anti-depressants
and soon it graduated onto

01:10:35.807 --> 01:10:38.640
harder and harder self-medication.

01:10:42.525 --> 01:10:45.025
We had two beautiful children.

01:10:46.226 --> 01:10:47.805
I try not to think of them.

01:10:47.805 --> 01:10:50.555
Push them to the back of my mind.

01:10:51.925 --> 01:10:53.508
They're all I have.

01:10:54.677 --> 01:10:58.094
(dark atmospheric music)

01:11:11.613 --> 01:11:13.196
- I need something.

01:11:25.076 --> 01:11:27.076
(pants)

01:11:40.628 --> 01:11:41.711
- Let me out.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.873
(both moan)

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:53.450
(Lexie pants)

01:11:58.188 --> 01:11:59.622
- [Lexie] Yes.

01:11:59.622 --> 01:12:01.622
(pants)

01:12:07.841 --> 01:12:08.674
Fuck.

01:12:16.452 --> 01:12:18.452
(pants)

01:12:21.472 --> 01:12:24.305
(pants and moans)

01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:32.567
(pants)

01:12:35.687 --> 01:12:37.687
(pants)

01:12:42.115 --> 01:12:44.115
(moans)

01:12:52.537 --> 01:12:56.037
(light atmospheric music)

01:12:59.645 --> 01:13:02.062
(man groans)

01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:36.298
(man pants)
(dark atmospheric music)

01:13:41.987 --> 01:13:45.070
(Lexie quietly sobs)

01:14:02.956 --> 01:14:05.373
(Lexie sobs)

01:14:35.518 --> 01:14:38.935
(dark atmospheric tones)

01:14:46.984 --> 01:14:48.528
(suspenseful music)

01:14:48.528 --> 01:14:51.028
(Lexie gasps)

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:01.041
(Lexie grunts)

01:15:03.768 --> 01:15:07.000
(man chuckles)

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:07.833
- Shark.

01:15:15.504 --> 01:15:17.053
Yeah.

01:15:17.053 --> 01:15:19.636
I get where you're comin' from.

01:15:22.293 --> 01:15:23.793
I'm all alone too.

01:15:26.482 --> 01:15:28.065
Her name was Cathy.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.666
She was the love of my life.

01:15:34.544 --> 01:15:36.693
- I thought you said my name was Britney.

01:15:36.693 --> 01:15:38.042
- Yeah.

01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:39.813
Yeah, Britney.

01:15:39.813 --> 01:15:41.146
Did I say Cathy?

01:15:42.853 --> 01:15:44.270
Oh, it's the sun.

01:15:45.672 --> 01:15:48.339
The sun is messing with my mind.

01:15:50.842 --> 01:15:53.762
- In your head, all of
these women are the same.

01:15:53.762 --> 01:15:54.679
Am I right?

01:15:56.544 --> 01:15:57.377
- Britney.

01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:06.184
- I'm right.

01:16:06.184 --> 01:16:10.544
You keep killing the same woman
and dumping her in the sea.

01:16:10.544 --> 01:16:13.127
(man chuckles)

01:16:14.042 --> 01:16:18.209
- Baby, you come up with
some of the craziest things.

01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:25.834
- Do you think people ever change?

01:16:27.144 --> 01:16:30.727
- People change their
clothes all the time.

01:16:32.042 --> 01:16:34.542
- They have to want to change.

01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:42.075
- People change their (mumbles).

01:16:50.677 --> 01:16:54.094
(dark atmospheric tones)

01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:12.654
(suspenseful atmospheric music)

01:17:24.318 --> 01:17:26.985
(ominous tones)

01:17:38.169 --> 01:17:40.252
(laughs)

01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:46.169
Just a little pin prick.

01:17:46.169 --> 01:17:47.820
And you'll feel,

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.070
so much better.

01:17:54.779 --> 01:17:57.446
- If I do this, I'll never stop.

01:17:59.116 --> 01:17:59.949
I'll die.

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:03.463
- You're already dead.

01:18:05.089 --> 01:18:07.939
- So I might as well make
enough to do just that.

01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:11.106
(dark abrasive tones)

01:18:15.979 --> 01:18:18.550
(man chuckles)

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:22.633
- Just this one last time,
and then you can stop.

01:18:25.158 --> 01:18:26.825
- If I do, I'll die.

01:18:28.366 --> 01:18:30.616
- Just, just one last time.

01:18:39.085 --> 01:18:40.808
(dark atmospheric tones)

01:18:40.808 --> 01:18:41.975
- Not anymore.

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:50.042
(somber music)

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:19.601
Please, will somebody
take me to San Diego?

01:19:24.739 --> 01:19:27.406
(ominous tones)

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:33.632
(suspenseful music)

01:19:51.448 --> 01:19:54.355
- Neither one of us ever
gonna see San Diego, darlin'.

01:19:54.355 --> 01:19:57.474
(music swells)

01:19:57.474 --> 01:19:59.067
(grunts)
(thud)

01:19:59.067 --> 01:20:02.825
(dark suspenseful music)

01:20:02.825 --> 01:20:05.513
- I'm not Cathy, I'm
not Brit or your wife,

01:20:05.513 --> 01:20:07.753
or whatever your wives' names are.

01:20:07.753 --> 01:20:11.253
- Why are you always trying to confuse me?

01:20:13.383 --> 01:20:14.800
I love you, baby.

01:20:15.804 --> 01:20:18.971
- If you love me, why did you kill me?

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:24.734
- You're my soul mate.

01:20:25.753 --> 01:20:27.586
If I can't have you...

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:30.950
no one can.

01:20:33.084 --> 01:20:34.880
- This is your wife.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.564
This is your wife, not me.

01:20:36.564 --> 01:20:39.647
This is your wife, you crazy bastard.

01:20:40.913 --> 01:20:42.163
- No more lies.

01:20:43.543 --> 01:20:44.503
No more.

01:20:44.503 --> 01:20:46.943
No more controlling me.

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.693
No more confusing me.

01:20:49.764 --> 01:20:52.852
- You're out of your god-damn mind.

01:20:52.852 --> 01:20:54.844
- Don't mind fucking me!

01:20:54.844 --> 01:20:56.770
(music swells)

01:20:56.770 --> 01:21:00.187
(dark suspenseful music)

01:21:14.194 --> 01:21:15.944
- Don't you touch me.

01:21:18.691 --> 01:21:20.989
- Well you can relax, because next time,

01:21:20.989 --> 01:21:24.131
I won't be the one with my
hands tied behind my back.

01:21:24.131 --> 01:21:27.560
- I've been sober over
a week now, asshole!

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.600
I'm thinking a lot more clear.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.433
Whether we do or we don't
will be on my terms.

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:50.409
(dark electronic music)

01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:34.474
(music swells)

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:38.990
(suspenseful music)

01:22:59.576 --> 01:23:02.915
- Funny thing about killing someone.

01:23:02.915 --> 01:23:06.832
You never get that
toothpaste back in the tube.

01:23:13.985 --> 01:23:14.818
Come on!

01:23:21.334 --> 01:23:23.834
(Lexie pants)

01:23:30.835 --> 01:23:31.777
(chuckles)

01:23:31.777 --> 01:23:33.110
You can't do it.

01:23:36.377 --> 01:23:37.414
(Lexie whimpers)

01:23:37.414 --> 01:23:39.914
(Lexie gasps)

01:23:42.486 --> 01:23:45.903
(dark atmospheric music)

01:23:48.334 --> 01:23:50.501
It would have been easier.

01:23:51.958 --> 01:23:53.375
I should be dead.

01:23:54.758 --> 01:23:57.758
You wouldn't be dead if I were dead.

01:24:05.267 --> 01:24:07.684
(gun clicks)

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.417
(gun clicks)

01:24:16.108 --> 01:24:20.025
(music swells and intensifies)

01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:26.742
(Lexie yelps)

01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:30.909
(Lexie screams)
(man groans)

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.394
(Lexie whimpers)

01:24:35.394 --> 01:24:38.477
(intense dark music)

01:26:49.598 --> 01:26:52.431
(splashing water)

01:26:54.966 --> 01:26:58.716
(sinister atmospheric music)

01:27:49.423 --> 01:27:52.173
(peaceful music)

01:27:58.028 --> 01:27:59.611
- Hey, little lady.

01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:05.278
Take you all this time to get out here?

01:28:09.714 --> 01:28:11.881
Did you come to rescue me?

01:28:15.057 --> 01:28:19.224
I haven't given anyone a
reason to rescue me lately.

01:28:21.734 --> 01:28:23.734
You need to go get help.

01:28:32.267 --> 01:28:33.434
Get some help.

01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:37.278
I need help.

01:29:00.396 --> 01:29:01.229
Hey, baby.

01:29:05.088 --> 01:29:07.255
Did you have a nice sleep?

01:29:11.377 --> 01:29:12.294
I miss you.

01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:14.791
So much.

01:29:19.772 --> 01:29:22.439
You've always loved this blanky.

01:29:27.444 --> 01:29:31.611
You know the essence about
blanky is to keep you warm.

01:29:33.899 --> 01:29:35.899
Its job's to cuddle you.

01:29:42.512 --> 01:29:45.095
And my job is to be your mommy.

01:29:57.031 --> 01:30:01.198
(dark atmospheric tones swelling)

01:30:04.871 --> 01:30:07.871
(suspenseful music)

01:30:25.329 --> 01:30:26.496
Without you...

01:30:28.231 --> 01:30:30.148
I have no reason to be.

01:30:35.021 --> 01:30:38.521
(light atmospheric music)

01:30:41.356 --> 01:30:42.773
- [Man] Lady Bug.

01:30:44.383 --> 01:30:45.550
There you are.

01:30:58.815 --> 01:31:02.232
(dark atmospheric music)

01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:08.249
♫ Lady Bug

01:31:08.249 --> 01:31:10.499
♫ Lady Bug

01:31:11.407 --> 01:31:13.657
♫ Fly away

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:19.770

01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.982

01:33:04.419 --> 01:33:05.252
No!

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:09.750
Stop!

01:33:13.509 --> 01:33:15.926
(man groans)

01:33:20.157 --> 01:33:21.208
Stop.

01:33:21.208 --> 01:33:23.077
- You're coming in with me!

01:33:23.077 --> 01:33:25.517
(Lexie screams)

01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:26.379
(Lexie screams)

01:33:26.379 --> 01:33:27.677
Get off!

01:33:27.677 --> 01:33:28.510
No!

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:29.870

01:34:43.332 --> 01:34:44.165
Help.

01:34:45.268 --> 01:34:46.101
Please.

01:34:48.999 --> 01:34:52.749
(whirring helicopter blades)

01:35:09.663 --> 01:35:13.246

01:36:12.844 --> 01:36:14.603
(screaming)

01:36:14.603 --> 01:36:17.603
