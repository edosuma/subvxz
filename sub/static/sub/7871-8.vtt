00:06.037 --> 00:08.224
Welcome to the Montgomery
Burns Prize,

00:08.324 --> 00:12.449
rewarding excellence,
in the field of alternative energy.

00:12.474 --> 00:15.729
Local inventors are vying for a
million dollar stipend donated

00:15.754 --> 00:18.433
by T. Mongomery Burns, as part
of a court settlement

00:18.458 --> 00:21.418
for causing one billion dollars
of environmental damage.

00:21.518 --> 00:24.237
Shoo. Go have one
of your enormous litters.

00:24.271 --> 00:26.723
(growls, screeches)

00:26.757 --> 00:28.691
First inventor,
you, bus driver.

00:28.726 --> 00:30.393
Give us the gist
of your terrible idea.

00:30.427 --> 00:33.263
Well, I've harnessed the
ancient power of slavery

00:33.297 --> 00:36.182
to run the school bus
of tomorrow.

00:39.386 --> 00:40.587
(groans, sighs)

00:40.621 --> 00:42.322
Whose boy is this?

00:42.356 --> 00:43.823
I'll take him home.

00:43.857 --> 00:45.625
You'll take his place.

00:45.659 --> 00:47.227
(groans)

00:47.261 --> 00:48.695
I would like to present

00:48.729 --> 00:50.964
my Kwik-E-Smart perpetual
energy machine.

00:50.998 --> 00:53.466
Three years ago,
I tripped over the cord,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.985
but the hotdogs,
they kept rolling.

00:56.020 --> 00:58.738
Some say they're powered
by decaying nitrates,

00:58.772 --> 01:02.141
others by tiny insects
beneath the hot dog skins.

01:02.176 --> 01:03.626
(wry laugh)

01:03.661 --> 01:05.662
Hard to believe I once turned
down a job in Tampa, Florida,

01:05.696 --> 01:07.413
because I believed in this city.

01:07.448 --> 01:08.798
That was 15 years ago.

01:08.832 --> 01:09.983
They wouldn't take you now.

01:10.017 --> 01:11.985
Is anyone here
an actual scientist?

01:12.019 --> 01:13.436
Uh, yes, I have, on occasion,

01:13.470 --> 01:16.172
dabbled in the scientific arts.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.958
Frink Labs,
a division of Allied Frink,

01:18.993 --> 01:20.326
the Good-Glavin people,

01:20.361 --> 01:24.380
are proud to present
the Frinkasonic MHV.

01:24.415 --> 01:27.166
And what, pray tell,
is MHV?

01:27.201 --> 01:30.453
Oh, yes,
it's the Moyvin-Hoyvin Vehicle.

01:30.487 --> 01:32.522
This non-magnetic babe magnet

01:32.556 --> 01:35.091
is powered entirely by,
you guessed it,

01:35.125 --> 01:36.526
(quietly):
sound waves.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.360
(crowd murmuring)

01:37.394 --> 01:39.295
(engine starts)

01:41.365 --> 01:42.398
Ah, yes, you see?

01:42.416 --> 01:44.066
Your quite appropriate
oohs and ahs

01:44.084 --> 01:46.736
are propelling me forward.
It's wonderful.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.421
(gasping, murmuring excitedly)

01:48.455 --> 01:51.824
That's slightly more enthusiasm
than I had anticipated.

01:52.559 --> 01:53.693
For the love of God,

01:53.727 --> 01:56.012
step on the brakes!

01:56.046 --> 01:57.830
The brakes are powered
by silence.

01:57.865 --> 01:59.816
(people yelling)

02:00.884 --> 02:02.118
(Willie yelling)

02:02.152 --> 02:04.804
Look out because of the zooming.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.392
Why is it ejecting?

02:09.425 --> 02:11.377
It's just a normal seat...!

02:14.315 --> 02:16.265
(gasping, shouting)

02:17.267 --> 02:19.135
(all screaming)
No! No!

02:19.169 --> 02:20.636
I'm okay.

02:20.671 --> 02:22.839
I'll just go live with my son.

02:22.873 --> 02:24.707
(screaming)
No! No!

02:25.909 --> 02:27.310
Hurry up.

02:27.344 --> 02:29.379
I want to get Grampa
back here by 3:00,

02:29.413 --> 02:32.382
so we can get him and Maggie
on the same nap schedule.

02:32.416 --> 02:33.583
I've labeled all his boxes.

02:33.617 --> 02:35.018
(laughs)

02:35.052 --> 02:36.786
Well, I can't pick up
something this heavy

02:36.820 --> 02:38.121
without my lifting belt.

02:38.155 --> 02:40.056
(sudden shout)
Ow!

02:40.090 --> 02:41.891
You know you can't
lift your lifting belt

02:41.925 --> 02:44.527
without wearing your
belt-lifting-belt.

02:44.561 --> 02:45.728
Oh, no.

02:45.763 --> 02:48.131
I won't be able
to help you pack up Grampa.

02:48.165 --> 02:49.215
Fine.

02:49.249 --> 02:51.684
Just stay here and
hold down the fort.

02:51.719 --> 02:53.052
Hold down the fort?

02:53.087 --> 02:54.687
With my bad back?

02:54.722 --> 02:56.723
(groans)

02:59.193 --> 03:00.326
(chuckles)

03:00.361 --> 03:03.329
Man, that keyboard-playing cat
is so cute.

03:03.364 --> 03:06.165
(playing jazzy tune
over tablet speaker)

03:06.200 --> 03:07.734
"Villageville"?!

03:07.768 --> 03:11.170
"Build your own authentic
medieval village."

03:11.205 --> 03:13.272
I must have
something better to do.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.076
And ca-lick.

03:17.111 --> 03:19.362
(fanfare plays)

03:19.396 --> 03:21.864
Finally, a woodcutter that will
do what I tell him.

03:21.899 --> 03:23.933
(humming happily)

03:23.967 --> 03:25.268
Holy moley!

03:25.302 --> 03:27.737
He's already made a clearing.

03:27.771 --> 03:29.539
Let's go for a glade.

03:30.641 --> 03:33.926
(chopping and bell dinging
repeatedly)

03:33.961 --> 03:35.261
(chuckles)

03:35.295 --> 03:36.796
Just call me DeForest Kelley.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.765
I gotta write that down
and send it to Conan.

03:38.799 --> 03:41.467
Oh, move this here-- tap.

03:42.786 --> 03:44.437
Mill, mill.

03:44.471 --> 03:45.838
Barn, silo.

03:45.873 --> 03:48.007
Tavern, tavern, tavern, tavern,
tavern, tavern...

03:48.041 --> 03:49.542
Brothel.

03:49.576 --> 03:50.843
Parsonage.

03:50.878 --> 03:52.295
A Theater in the Round.

03:52.329 --> 03:54.564
And...

03:54.598 --> 03:56.249
hay pile.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.867
(panting)

03:57.885 --> 03:59.035
"And the Lord saw

03:59.069 --> 04:00.770
"what He had made,

04:00.804 --> 04:02.738
and it was good."

04:02.773 --> 04:04.273
(groans)

04:04.308 --> 04:05.675
VILLAGERS (over speaker):
Ew.

04:05.709 --> 04:07.076
Yeah, that's right,

04:07.111 --> 04:09.579
your Lord sticks his hand
in his pants.

04:09.613 --> 04:13.516
And yes, it is the same hand
I tapped you with.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.151
(bell dings)

04:20.023 --> 04:21.457
Well, if I've learned anything,

04:21.492 --> 04:24.827
it's that you can't have
too much iron ore.

04:24.862 --> 04:27.763
Maybe one of your tavern wenches
can do the laundry.

04:29.082 --> 04:30.316
(shrieks)
You're back.

04:30.350 --> 04:31.784
Did you spend this whole time

04:31.819 --> 04:34.153
doing fake chores
in a fake village?

04:34.188 --> 04:37.490
It's real to them.
(groans)

04:37.524 --> 04:39.592
Um, where's
Santa's Little Helper?

04:39.626 --> 04:40.993
I don't know.
The backyard?

04:41.028 --> 04:42.962
The backyard?
But what if he got out

04:42.996 --> 04:45.998
through your half-completed
tunnel to Flanders's fridge?

04:47.534 --> 04:48.801
I don't see him anywhere.

04:48.836 --> 04:51.003
You jackass.
You lost our dog!

04:51.038 --> 04:52.688
Oh, my God.

04:52.723 --> 04:55.458
I forgot to feed my jackass.

04:57.194 --> 04:59.162
(bellowing):
Hank-hew.

04:59.196 --> 05:00.863
(bellowing):
You're welcome.

05:03.034 --> 05:05.636
Santa's Little Helper.

05:05.670 --> 05:09.707
Santa's Little Helper!

05:09.741 --> 05:10.975
I love that dog,

05:11.009 --> 05:13.477
but that is one long,
stupid name.

05:17.132 --> 05:18.632
(both groaning)

05:18.667 --> 05:21.268
(meows)

05:23.338 --> 05:24.872
What the hell?

05:24.906 --> 05:26.173
Oh, right.

05:28.059 --> 05:30.694
The animal shelter hasn't had
any greyhounds turned in.

05:30.729 --> 05:34.648
Just a dachshund, a chow,
and a pregnant raccoon.

05:34.683 --> 05:37.017
A lot of good backups.
How pregnant is the raccoon?

05:37.052 --> 05:38.485
We don't want a raccoon.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.570
Good, Marge.

05:39.604 --> 05:40.821
Get their price down.

05:40.855 --> 05:43.123
Dad, I just
noticed something.

05:43.158 --> 05:45.192
You're not upset enough
about this.

05:45.227 --> 05:47.127
Hey, Lisa's right.

05:47.162 --> 05:50.297
You're the only one who
hasn't cried about the dog.

05:50.332 --> 05:51.298
Not a crier.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.234
What? You cry all the time.

05:53.268 --> 05:56.470
You cried when they canceled
that show you hated.

05:56.504 --> 05:58.472
Goofing on it made me feel wise.

05:58.506 --> 05:59.974
(whimpering)

06:00.008 --> 06:02.893
Where is that coming from?
From the kitchen.

06:03.628 --> 06:06.030
(gasps) He's alive!

06:06.064 --> 06:08.065
And he didn't pee on the floor.

06:08.099 --> 06:10.334
For me,
that's a perfect day.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.970
(everyone talking at once)

06:13.004 --> 06:15.873
Dad, why'd you shut our dog
in a cabinet?

06:15.907 --> 06:16.974
I'll answer that.

06:17.008 --> 06:18.809
Your father's an idiot.

06:18.843 --> 06:21.412
I believe the word is <i>idiote.</i>

06:21.446 --> 06:23.814
How did Santa's Little Helper
get in there?

06:23.848 --> 06:26.750
(gasps)
I know what must have happened.

06:28.169 --> 06:29.987
I'm going to get a snack,

06:30.021 --> 06:33.190
but first, should I introduce
the black plague?

06:33.224 --> 06:34.892
Mm... what could be the harm?

06:34.926 --> 06:36.060
(man screaming over speaker)

06:36.094 --> 06:38.362
Whoa, now I've got to buy
a corpse wagon.

06:38.396 --> 06:39.730
Well, that's how they get you.

06:41.549 --> 06:43.984
Hmm... ooh, it's amazing

06:44.019 --> 06:47.688
how many things they can
make taste like cheese.

06:47.722 --> 06:50.724
Oh, yeah, baby, I'm drinking
you down to your knees.

06:50.759 --> 06:51.842
(sniffing)

06:51.876 --> 06:53.344
♪ Gonna drink ammonia

06:53.378 --> 06:54.928
♪ 'Cause it tastes like cheese

06:54.963 --> 06:57.364
♪ I wonder what will happen...

06:58.967 --> 07:01.969
A minstrel has composed
a roundelay mocking me?

07:02.003 --> 07:03.170
Torture, torture, torture.

07:03.204 --> 07:04.355
(people screaming over speaker)

07:04.389 --> 07:07.925
Well, it's time we showed
this dog some love.

07:07.959 --> 07:08.759
Oh.
Oh.

07:08.793 --> 07:09.777
(all speak soothingly)

07:09.828 --> 07:11.578
Attaboy.

07:11.613 --> 07:13.747
Hey Homer, how come
you're not hugging the dog?

07:13.782 --> 07:15.916
He knows I love him,
and he loves me.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.451
(growling)

07:17.485 --> 07:19.987
That's short for
"Rrright you are."

07:20.021 --> 07:22.890
I don't think you even like
Santa's Little Helper.

07:22.924 --> 07:26.293
You never take him for walks
or sleep with him in your arms.

07:26.328 --> 07:29.730
And I suspect you've been
chewing on his treats.

07:29.764 --> 07:32.700
How are they his treats
if I paid for them?

07:32.734 --> 07:33.934
Okay, okay.

07:33.968 --> 07:35.202
I'll be nicer to the dude.

07:35.236 --> 07:37.304
I've just never really
been a dog person.

07:37.339 --> 07:38.939
Really? What about Bongo?

07:38.973 --> 07:40.691
Bongo?!

07:40.725 --> 07:43.277
I told you never
to ever talk about Bongo.

07:43.311 --> 07:46.096
(sobbing)

07:46.131 --> 07:49.066
Ever!

07:49.100 --> 07:51.068
What just happened?
Who's Bongo?

07:51.102 --> 07:54.171
Bongo was Homer's dog
when he was a boy.

07:54.205 --> 07:55.806
HOMER:
He's still my dog!

07:55.840 --> 07:58.075
We got him years ago.

07:58.109 --> 07:59.877
HOMER: I don't know what you
just said, but it's wrong!

07:59.911 --> 08:01.145
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

08:01.179 --> 08:04.581
(sighs)
I was working long hours

08:04.615 --> 08:07.117
<i>at the Springfield</i>
<i>Smokestack Factory.</i>

08:08.953 --> 08:12.072
<i>Oh, I was so tired</i>
<i>when I got home.</i>

08:12.107 --> 08:15.625
<i>Then little Homer</i>
<i>would start crying and crying,</i>

08:15.643 --> 08:18.345
<i>but Bongo knew just what to do.</i>

08:18.396 --> 08:20.397
(howling, crying stops)

08:21.699 --> 08:22.983
(snoring)

08:23.017 --> 08:26.820
Now, my dear, we can
watch <i>Mannix</i> as a couple.

08:26.855 --> 08:29.957
Unfortunately,
like all true stories,

08:29.991 --> 08:32.793
this one has a crappy ending.

08:32.827 --> 08:34.845
You have a story with an ending?

08:34.879 --> 08:37.514
Uh-huh. All my stories
have endings now.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.551
They're putting something
in my Jell-O down at the home.

08:40.585 --> 08:43.087
Anyway, Homer and that dog

08:43.121 --> 08:46.757
went together like Christmas
and suicidal thoughts.

08:46.791 --> 08:51.812
♪ Me and my Arrow

08:51.846 --> 08:54.948
♪ Straighter than narrow

09:29.734 --> 09:30.701
(stammers, gasps)

09:30.735 --> 09:32.269
I had no clue.

09:34.506 --> 09:36.106
Then came the fateful day

09:36.141 --> 09:38.075
when Mr. Burns was lobbying

09:38.109 --> 09:41.512
for the go-ahead
on his nuclear plant,

09:41.546 --> 09:43.881
<i>and he was giving away</i>

09:43.915 --> 09:47.234
<i>stuffed Isotoads</i>
<i>to all the children.</i>

09:47.268 --> 09:48.869
Have a toy.

09:48.903 --> 09:50.537
Don't thwart my ambition.

09:50.572 --> 09:52.372
Look, they even talk.

09:52.407 --> 09:55.275
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Cancer
clusters are random occurrences.

09:55.310 --> 09:56.376
Creepy.

09:56.411 --> 09:57.961
You can have mine, Bongo.

09:57.996 --> 10:00.714
Those toys are people bribes,
you good-hearted little brat.

10:01.766 --> 10:02.566
(growling)

10:02.600 --> 10:04.101
Ugh! He bit me!

10:04.135 --> 10:05.719
(growling)
Get him out of here, son.

10:05.753 --> 10:07.120
Now.

10:08.773 --> 10:11.275
Mr. Burns,
I'm awfully sorry.

10:11.309 --> 10:12.876
Oh, I'll be all right.

10:12.911 --> 10:15.245
Once I hold your
dying pet in my arms

10:15.280 --> 10:16.980
and feel his wagging
tail go stiff.

10:17.015 --> 10:19.816
Uh, sir, you are aware you're
at a PR event for children.

10:21.052 --> 10:22.252
(chuckles)

10:22.287 --> 10:24.071
Bring in the clown.

10:24.105 --> 10:25.155
Hey-hey!

10:25.190 --> 10:27.107
(laughs)

10:27.141 --> 10:29.142
So, Lady Godiva gets a haircut,

10:29.177 --> 10:30.477
right, and...

10:30.512 --> 10:31.595
Kids?

10:31.629 --> 10:32.729
Uh, no problem.

10:32.764 --> 10:34.331
I'll just cut
to my clean material.

10:34.365 --> 10:36.333
(muttering)

10:36.367 --> 10:38.168
Farmer's daughter, no.

10:38.203 --> 10:40.437
A man from Nantucket, no.

10:40.471 --> 10:42.039
Bring out the monkey!

10:44.542 --> 10:45.842
(laughing)

10:45.877 --> 10:49.246
Next time I'm getting
a smaller monkey.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.748
Ow! Gow! Ooh!

10:51.783 --> 10:53.183
Oh! Gah! All right!

10:54.297 --> 10:57.220
So Mr. Burns wanted
to kill Homer's dog.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.670
Homer had no idea.

10:58.705 --> 11:00.939
He was so innocent and chubby.

11:00.973 --> 11:03.308
Course now,
he's just stupid and fat.

11:03.342 --> 11:05.210
Focus.
Huh? Oh, right.

11:05.244 --> 11:06.778
Little Homer didn't know it,

11:06.813 --> 11:09.664
<i>but Burns had unleashed</i>
<i>the local dogcatcher</i>

11:09.699 --> 11:11.750
<i>to bring Bongo in.</i>

11:11.784 --> 11:13.668

11:13.703 --> 11:15.270

11:31.421 --> 11:36.091
When God closes a door,
he opens a gun shop.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.492
Wait.

11:37.527 --> 11:39.227
How could you know
what Herman said?

11:39.262 --> 11:41.163
You were driving away.

11:41.197 --> 11:42.898
He wrote a memoir.
Oh.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.967
Uh-oh.

11:46.002 --> 11:47.636
Huh.

11:47.670 --> 11:48.904
Oh.

11:48.938 --> 11:50.338
Anyway...

11:50.373 --> 11:51.690
(siren blaring)

11:51.724 --> 11:53.442
Son, I've got an idea.

11:53.476 --> 11:55.544
A hole next to the seat
to hold my cup?

11:55.578 --> 11:57.028
That's a stupid idea.

11:57.063 --> 11:58.914
Holding cups
are what thighs are for.

11:58.948 --> 12:00.365
Now hang on tight.

12:02.051 --> 12:04.336
(sniffing, panting, barking)

12:05.755 --> 12:06.705
(inhales)
Mmm!

12:06.739 --> 12:08.056
Smell them sausages, Lou.

12:08.091 --> 12:10.058
Are you sure
the Big Brother Program

12:10.093 --> 12:12.043
couldn't find me
anybody else?

12:12.078 --> 12:14.296
Yeah, well, you were
my last pick, too, okay?

12:16.299 --> 12:17.399
Tipping, aah!

12:17.433 --> 12:19.034
(barking)

12:19.068 --> 12:22.053
Oh, I'm a washout
as a dogcatcher.

12:22.088 --> 12:23.288
What do I do now?

12:23.322 --> 12:25.557
Well, my dream
is to be police chief.

12:25.591 --> 12:27.225
Oh, no, you can't 'cause,
um, that's my dream.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.420
I'm gonna be chief of police.

12:28.427 --> 12:30.195
Well, then I'll be
a spokesman for my people,

12:30.229 --> 12:31.630
like Ralph Abernathy.

12:31.664 --> 12:34.916
Ralph, I like that name.

12:36.752 --> 12:39.788
Man, this story
is filling in a lot of gaps.

12:39.822 --> 12:43.191
But I want to know about Dad
and his broken heart.

12:43.226 --> 12:45.260
Your father lost a lot
in his life--

12:45.294 --> 12:47.095
his hair, his mother,

12:47.130 --> 12:50.332
more games of Monopoly
than any man ought.

12:50.366 --> 12:54.736
He'd go to jail and stay there
'cause he loves the easy life,

12:54.770 --> 12:56.571
but I think losing that dog

12:56.606 --> 12:59.241
was the toughest blow of all.

12:59.275 --> 13:01.409
HOMER:
Where are we going, Daddy?

13:01.444 --> 13:03.428
Remember our old
neighbor, Miss Viola?

13:03.462 --> 13:05.697
Well, she moved to the country,
where there was no limit

13:05.731 --> 13:08.316
on how many pets one
single lady could own.

13:08.367 --> 13:09.784
Miss Viola?

13:09.819 --> 13:11.486
Isn't she cuckoo?

13:11.521 --> 13:14.823
Now, son,
a lot of people are cuckoo

13:14.874 --> 13:16.775
till you need something
from them.

13:16.809 --> 13:20.078
<i>I knew that Bongo would have</i>
<i>a good home there</i>

13:20.112 --> 13:22.280
<i>and Burns would never find him.</i>

13:22.315 --> 13:23.648
Gosh, Miss Viola,

13:23.683 --> 13:25.650
I want you
and your husband to know

13:25.685 --> 13:27.519
how much I appreciate this.

13:27.553 --> 13:29.688
(both groan,
then goat bleats)

13:29.722 --> 13:31.790
Well, let's get this dog in.

13:31.824 --> 13:33.491
(whimpers)
Come on.

13:33.526 --> 13:37.429
Son, uh, why don't you
give him your sweatshirt

13:37.463 --> 13:39.231
so he'll remember you.

13:39.265 --> 13:41.249
Okay.

13:41.284 --> 13:44.002
How long till we come back
and get him?

13:44.036 --> 13:46.338
<i>I had to tell my boy</i>

13:46.372 --> 13:49.174
<i>we were giving</i>
<i>away his dog for good.</i>

13:49.208 --> 13:51.509
<i>I wasn't sure if a six-year-old</i>

13:51.544 --> 13:53.812
<i>could even understand</i>
<i>the concept.</i>

13:53.846 --> 13:55.013
What? No.

13:55.047 --> 13:56.648
No! No!

13:56.666 --> 13:58.066
Bongo!

13:58.100 --> 13:59.901
(wailing)

13:59.936 --> 14:02.153
<i>Turns out,</i>
<i>he caught on pretty quick.</i>

14:04.571 --> 14:07.096
Your father was devastated.

14:07.204 --> 14:08.048
(crying)

14:08.049 --> 14:10.384
(scoffs)
Women and their crying.

14:10.418 --> 14:12.986
(sobbing):
Finish the damn story.

14:13.021 --> 14:16.023
I've got
a hockey game tonight.

14:16.057 --> 14:19.576
<i>When I finally got back</i>
<i>to the house...</i>

14:19.610 --> 14:22.129
Simpson, release your hound.

14:22.163 --> 14:25.215
He's already gone
where you'll never get him.

14:25.249 --> 14:27.184
I'm a powerful man, Simpson.

14:27.218 --> 14:29.436
I can walk into McDonalds,
order soup,

14:29.470 --> 14:30.704
and they'll make it.

14:30.738 --> 14:31.938
Go on. Get.

14:31.973 --> 14:35.058
I got a bug zapper,
and I ain't afraid to use it.

14:35.093 --> 14:37.277
Is that sugar water I smell?

14:37.311 --> 14:38.712
(electrical zapping)
(groans)

14:38.746 --> 14:41.631
Well, I'm afraid I
already told my dogs

14:41.666 --> 14:43.383
they could tear yours apart.

14:43.418 --> 14:45.869
Don't make me look into those
pitiless black eyes and say,

14:45.903 --> 14:49.306
"Daddy didn't bring you
a friend-friend to rip-rip!"

14:49.340 --> 14:50.557
Where's Bongo?

14:50.591 --> 14:52.008
Is he still
at the crazy lady's...

14:52.043 --> 14:53.310
Back to sleep, son.

14:53.344 --> 14:54.678
(chuckles)

14:57.131 --> 14:58.548
(groans, snores)

14:58.583 --> 15:00.083
Oh, listen,

15:00.118 --> 15:02.319
I can think of something
you'd enjoy

15:02.353 --> 15:04.054
more than killing a dog.

15:04.088 --> 15:05.555
Dropping a horse on a church?

15:05.590 --> 15:08.558
No! Breaking a man's spirit.

15:08.593 --> 15:09.793
Mine.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.762
Well, I guess I could always

15:11.796 --> 15:14.030
drop a horse on a
church afterward.

15:14.065 --> 15:14.865
Fine.

15:14.899 --> 15:16.249
<i>I had to take care</i>

15:16.284 --> 15:18.869
<i>of his hounds for a year.</i>

15:18.903 --> 15:20.087
<i>I tried to wear</i>

15:20.121 --> 15:21.588
<i>a bite-proof suit,</i>

15:21.622 --> 15:24.658
<i>but those satanic Snoopys</i>
<i>always found their way in.</i>

15:24.692 --> 15:26.710
(growling, groaning)

15:31.165 --> 15:32.632
I'm not done with you.

15:32.667 --> 15:36.803
I insist you never wear shoes
or a proper necktie again.

15:36.838 --> 15:38.071
Just house slippers

15:38.106 --> 15:40.474
and the most humiliating tie
there is:

15:40.508 --> 15:42.476
bolo.

15:42.510 --> 15:44.644
(gasps)

15:44.695 --> 15:46.279
<i>But the hardest part</i>

15:46.314 --> 15:49.583
<i>was that my son</i>
<i>was so angry with me.</i>

15:49.617 --> 15:51.184
How was school today?

15:51.219 --> 15:52.719
Ketchup, please.

15:52.753 --> 15:55.355
You're probably wondering
how I got rabies.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.923
Well...
I'm not hungry anymore.

15:56.958 --> 15:59.209
<i>Our relationship</i>
<i>never recovered,</i>

15:59.243 --> 16:02.946
<i>and no amount of ignoring</i>
<i>the problem could ever fix it.</i>

16:02.980 --> 16:04.197
(sobbing)

16:04.232 --> 16:07.367
Grampa, why is the
saddest story you ever told

16:07.401 --> 16:09.669
the only one that's
ever made sense?

16:09.704 --> 16:12.005
(scoffs)
Doesn't make sense to me.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.842
I happen to remember it
just a little differently.

16:15.877 --> 16:17.611
Well, tell us your version.

16:17.645 --> 16:21.398
Now granted, I was just a kid,
but I say...

16:21.432 --> 16:24.151
<i>Grampa always hated Bongo</i>

16:24.185 --> 16:26.119
<i>and loved money</i>
<i>so he sold Bongo</i>

16:26.154 --> 16:27.304
<i>to a wicked farm witch</i>

16:27.338 --> 16:29.523
<i>just so he could hang out</i>

16:29.557 --> 16:31.975
<i>with a bunch of rich dogs</i>
<i>and kidnapped Santa</i>

16:32.009 --> 16:35.045
<i>so I'd never get the toy</i>
<i>I actually wanted.</i>

16:35.079 --> 16:37.447
And then... then wha...

16:37.481 --> 16:38.932
and then what happened... was...

16:38.966 --> 16:41.718
(stammers)

16:41.752 --> 16:44.321
Gee, my story
doesn't make much sense

16:44.355 --> 16:46.056
except the Santa part.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.724
Yeah, but at least it was short.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.392
Wait. Wait.

16:49.427 --> 16:52.596
There's one part of the story
even Grampa didn't know about.

16:52.630 --> 16:56.333
A few months later,
I went to rescue Bongo.

17:02.156 --> 17:04.040
(coughing)

17:04.075 --> 17:07.042
Hendrix, come here, boy.

17:07.078 --> 17:08.979
(barking)

17:09.012 --> 17:11.982
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>I wasn't prepared for.</i>

17:12.016 --> 17:13.300
<i>Bongo was...</i>

17:13.334 --> 17:16.051
<i>happy without me.</i>

17:16.087 --> 17:19.356
<i>He had become her dog.</i>

17:19.390 --> 17:21.340
Oh, Homie.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.009
I'm so sorry.

17:23.044 --> 17:25.111
Well, that's just
the way dogs are.

17:25.146 --> 17:28.181
The most disloyal, unfaithful
creatures God ever made.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.251
Homer, maybe you should take
a look at this.

17:31.285 --> 17:34.955
A Christmas card I got
from Miss Viola years later.

17:37.742 --> 17:39.609
HOMER: He still had
my sweatshirt.

17:39.644 --> 17:41.578
Bongo didn't forget you.

17:41.612 --> 17:44.214
Unlike those gerbils
of yours we gave away.

17:44.248 --> 17:46.416
Oh, they were fickle as hell.

17:46.450 --> 17:48.184
Oh, my God, Dad.

17:48.219 --> 17:50.487
I owe you an apology.

17:50.521 --> 17:53.523
You saved Bongo.

17:53.557 --> 17:56.626
I never understood that
till now.

17:56.661 --> 17:58.295
(sobbing):
All these years I thought

17:58.329 --> 18:01.464
you loved that dog more than me.

18:01.499 --> 18:05.168
(sobbing):
Why would you think that?

18:05.202 --> 18:09.572
Just because I put you in a home
where they feed you dog food?

18:09.607 --> 18:12.575
Aw, give me a hug, son.

18:12.610 --> 18:15.478
Okay, but I'm a little
out of practice.

18:15.513 --> 18:18.682
Hold your arms like you're
carrying a wedding cake.

18:18.716 --> 18:19.849
What flavor?

18:19.884 --> 18:21.017
It doesn't matter.

18:21.052 --> 18:23.403
If it doesn't matter,
then I call Snickers.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.571
That's not a flavor.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.273
Everything's a flavor

18:26.307 --> 18:27.807
in the kitchens of today.

18:27.842 --> 18:29.442
Just hug already.

18:33.414 --> 18:35.548
Homie? Huh?

18:35.583 --> 18:38.285
(snoring)

18:38.319 --> 18:40.170
Come on, boy,
time to go to bed.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.055
My dog.

18:42.089 --> 18:44.658
All right, Homer,
it's your moment.

18:44.692 --> 18:46.126
But he's mine tomorrow.

19:16.607 --> 19:18.475
Romney lost.
Damn it.

19:18.509 --> 19:21.644
I guess it's time I explain
to these good people

19:21.679 --> 19:24.164
the upcoming fiscal cliff.

19:26.934 --> 19:30.553
Think of the economy as a car
and the rich man as the driver.

19:30.588 --> 19:32.672
If you don't give the
driver all the money,

19:32.707 --> 19:34.224
he'll drive you over a cliff.

19:34.258 --> 19:37.227
It's just common sense.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.995
Furthermore,
rich people feel things

19:39.030 --> 19:40.830
more deeply than the common man.

19:40.865 --> 19:44.167
(screaming, sobbing)

19:44.201 --> 19:46.703
And we've got to change our
approach to immigration.

19:46.737 --> 19:49.639
I have a progressive proposal
to let into this country

19:49.673 --> 19:52.025
200 grimy Irishmen a year.

19:52.059 --> 19:54.127
I've got lots of potatoes
that need peeling

19:54.161 --> 19:55.895
and stables to be mucked out.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.547
Sir, the insta-polls are in.

19:57.581 --> 19:59.349
You're just digging
yourself deeper.

19:59.383 --> 20:00.817
Well, then let me
just say this.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.553
Marco Rubio...
(speaking Spanish)

20:03.587 --> 20:05.488
I'm afraid you
just made things even worse.

20:05.523 --> 20:06.790
How? Why?

20:06.824 --> 20:09.092
You just said Marco Rubio
is a pink handkerchief.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.877
This public service announcement
is over.

20:13.439 --> 20:15.240
BURNS:
<i>Execute the cameraman.</i>

20:55.648 --> 20:56.720
Shh!
