WEBVTT

00:00.091 --> 00:03.394
Last week, I got so, like
stuck in that dude's clavicle.

00:03.462 --> 00:04.995
You know, like, detail wise.

00:05.063 --> 00:06.830
Just really wanna get it right.

00:06.898 --> 00:10.267
Greetings, this week we
will be focusing on movement.

00:10.335 --> 00:13.437
The model will be changing
positions every minute.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.943
May your pencil soften her crudeness.

00:25.450 --> 00:26.818
Hey, Ab.

00:28.854 --> 00:31.756
Uh, models have to be silent.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.324
Oh, my God, I'm a model?

00:36.862 --> 00:38.796
Dude, thank you so much for
telling me how much nude models

00:38.863 --> 00:40.665
can make in a class like this?

00:41.332 --> 00:43.033
I need the money.

00:43.101 --> 00:45.903
Yeah, totally, I just...
I didn't mean my class.

00:45.970 --> 00:46.970
Oh, my God, are you mad at me?

00:47.038 --> 00:48.805
Ali, is there a problem?

00:48.873 --> 00:50.774
It's Abbi, remember, we talked about that.

00:50.841 --> 00:53.377
But, no, we're just strategizing...

00:53.444 --> 00:57.847
like the shading... of the boobs.

00:57.915 --> 01:00.483
'Cause I'm, you know,
I'm not there yet, so...

01:06.857 --> 01:07.924
Stop it.

01:07.991 --> 01:09.325
Oh, sorry.

01:09.393 --> 01:12.128
Guys, hey, sorry, I'm gonna
change positions before

01:12.195 --> 01:13.362
the bell rings.

01:13.430 --> 01:14.730
I'm weirding Abbi out, it's my b.

01:40.356 --> 01:41.623
Hey, Ab, where you heading?

01:41.691 --> 01:44.626
Hey, not much... I mean, nowhere.

01:44.694 --> 01:46.894
I'm actually getting my
wisdom teeth taken out today,

01:46.963 --> 01:48.163
- so I'm having surgery.
- Oh, man,

01:48.230 --> 01:50.031
I had mine taken out the week of my prom.

01:50.099 --> 01:52.567
In all the pictures, I had
these huge chipmunk cheeks.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.036
- I was like...
- That's so cute.

01:55.104 --> 01:56.671
Yeah, it's good, though, 'cause, um,

01:56.738 --> 01:58.706
it'll make more room in my mouth, right?

02:03.645 --> 02:07.247
No, I, I didn't... I
didn't mean, um, blow jobs.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.181
Although, if that is true,

02:09.249 --> 02:11.584
that it would make more room in my mouth.

02:11.652 --> 02:13.819
I didn't do them.

02:13.887 --> 02:15.220
I enjoy it both ways.

02:15.288 --> 02:17.857
You know, I think it's a two-way street.

02:17.925 --> 02:20.825
In fact, I'm getting a call, it's ringing.

02:20.893 --> 02:22.027
Busy day.

02:22.095 --> 02:23.495
Hello?

02:23.563 --> 02:24.696
One sec, Jeremy... just give me one...

02:24.764 --> 02:27.832
Yup? Well, my laundry is in the bag!

02:29.069 --> 02:31.236
What do you mean, "Stains are on it?"

02:31.304 --> 02:33.338
Well, what do you mean
they're on my underwear?

02:33.406 --> 02:34.540
Why would someone say that?

02:34.607 --> 02:36.140
Why would they say...

02:36.208 --> 02:38.777
It's my laundry man and then he's upset.

02:38.844 --> 02:39.811
I'll let you take it.

02:39.879 --> 02:42.313
Yeah, why... don't you talk back to me!

02:42.381 --> 02:46.417
I will come down there and
I will get you right away!

02:46.485 --> 02:48.620
So you better lawyer
up, 'cause I'm gonna...

02:48.688 --> 02:50.589
... kill myself right now.

02:56.361 --> 02:57.661
Okay, Ab.

02:57.729 --> 02:59.263
You are doing an awesome job already.

02:59.330 --> 03:00.798
You just keep clutching Bingo Bronson

03:00.866 --> 03:02.566
that Mommy Lani got you...

03:02.634 --> 03:04.201
Me, I'm Mommy Lani.

03:04.269 --> 03:05.703
And that's it, whole
thing's gonna be painless.

03:05.771 --> 03:08.338
You're not even go know it,
you're gonna be out, out, out.

03:08.406 --> 03:09.572
You just chill.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.174
So riddle me this, Doc.

03:11.242 --> 03:14.444
Mayonnaise clinic claims that
facial paralysis can be a thing?

03:14.512 --> 03:16.146
- What?
- Care to comment?

03:16.214 --> 03:18.882
- Release my head, woman.
- Sorry.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.118
I got this, Abbi's gonna be fine.

03:21.185 --> 03:22.852
Look at this black-blue hands.

03:22.921 --> 03:24.388
If I mess up this white girl's teeth,

03:24.455 --> 03:27.757
the black dentistry
game is over... forever.

03:27.825 --> 03:30.359
I'm gonna get these teeth.

03:30.428 --> 03:32.529
- For my people.
- Wow.

03:32.596 --> 03:33.630
I don't do anything for my people.

03:35.900 --> 03:36.900
Count backwards.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.002
Five, four

03:40.070 --> 03:41.938
two and one.

03:42.005 --> 03:44.773
Bye, Abbi, I'll see you when you wake up.

03:44.841 --> 03:46.708
And if you don't wake
up, I'll still see you...

03:46.776 --> 03:48.811
'cause I'm gonna kill myself

03:48.878 --> 03:52.848
and meet you in heaven or whatever.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.317
Calm d... you need to calm down.

03:54.384 --> 03:55.851
I am Abbi's keeper today.

03:55.919 --> 03:57.786
I am her mother, sister, father, brother.

03:57.854 --> 04:00.656
Relax, I get it, okay.

04:00.723 --> 04:02.825
I know what you need, a little story.

04:02.892 --> 04:05.727
There once was a woman
named Felicity Porter.

04:05.795 --> 04:09.064
And she went to the University of New York.

04:09.131 --> 04:11.166
She was supposed to go to Stanford.

04:11.233 --> 04:12.768
That's where her parents wanted her to go.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.503
But then, Ben wrote in
her high school yearbook...

04:23.946 --> 04:26.014
So you're telling me that
out of the whole series,

04:26.082 --> 04:29.484
there's one black person, and
she's the one who's killed off.

04:29.551 --> 04:32.920
Yeah, but you're... you're
kind of missing the point Ilana.

04:32.988 --> 04:36.323
I don't think these drugs
are working, you guys.

04:36.391 --> 04:38.593
When are my teeth gonna get...

04:38.660 --> 04:41.762
♪ Surgical, surgical ♪

04:43.064 --> 04:44.465
Ab, it's already over.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.667
It was a huge success, but I
had to remove all of your teeth.

04:47.735 --> 04:50.637
But don't worry, there's a
huge internet community of dudes

04:50.705 --> 04:53.640
that like women that are super gum-heavy.

04:53.708 --> 04:54.908
It's a huge fetish.

04:54.976 --> 04:56.877
Lincoln, you took out all of her teeth?

04:56.944 --> 05:01.015
No, you were here the entire
time, you saw... everything.

05:01.082 --> 05:02.082
That's true.

05:02.150 --> 05:05.886
I am just "gwad my wittle baby's awive."

05:05.953 --> 05:07.521
- Don't touch her mouth!
- Ow!

05:07.588 --> 05:09.389
- Don't touch her... What... why would you...
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:09.456 --> 05:10.725
- She just had surgery.
- I'm sorry, that was so bad.

05:10.733 --> 05:11.965
My mouth is like...

05:12.728 --> 05:14.529
Here's a prescription for Vicodin.

05:14.597 --> 05:17.332
Give her two every four hours.

05:17.399 --> 05:18.500
Make sure... can you handle that?

05:18.567 --> 05:19.934
It's a very strict schedule.

05:20.002 --> 05:22.136
I don't know, I guess I can handle it.

05:22.203 --> 05:24.038
You know, Western medicine does stick

05:24.106 --> 05:25.372
to a pretty strict schedule.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.907
The sooner you... you take more pills

05:26.975 --> 05:29.176
the sooner you buy more pills, right?

05:29.244 --> 05:32.079
Chomp, chomp, chomp,
swallow, swallow, swallow.

05:32.147 --> 05:34.615
(bleep) government-regulated, Doctor Drew

05:34.683 --> 05:35.915
all-you-can-eat buffet!

05:41.189 --> 05:42.922
Uh, but, really, I can handle it.

05:46.894 --> 05:48.495
Ab!

05:48.563 --> 05:50.564
Oh, no. Abbi.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.168
I'm just gonna get weed
from one of my weed dudes.

05:55.235 --> 05:59.039
It will literally take
two seconds for real.

05:59.106 --> 06:00.874
And then we're gonna get you home, girl.

06:00.941 --> 06:03.609
Uh, do you wanna hear my
Drew Barrymore impression?

06:03.678 --> 06:05.545
Yes, queen please, Drew Barrymore.

06:05.612 --> 06:08.881
I love Jimmy Fallon.

06:08.948 --> 06:12.285
Um, I have my own makeup line.

06:12.352 --> 06:14.620
Oh, my God, am I being so mean?

06:14.688 --> 06:17.190
I love her, you know she's my favorite.

06:17.257 --> 06:19.425
No, dude, it's not mean at all.

06:19.493 --> 06:21.561
And the gauze in your
mouth adds authenticity.

06:21.628 --> 06:23.429
My production company,

06:23.497 --> 06:25.497
- Flower Films...
- I love Flower Films.

06:25.565 --> 06:31.203
... was founded in 1999 with
the popular film, "Whip It."

06:31.270 --> 06:34.807
- That is what she sounds like.
- Oh, my God, I'm terrible.

06:34.874 --> 06:36.274
No, you're so good.

06:36.342 --> 06:38.376
It was 1995 (bleep)!

06:38.444 --> 06:40.445
No, keep going, it's good,
she would love this impression.

06:41.847 --> 06:46.518
My grandfather was the legendary
film actor, John Barrymore.

06:46.586 --> 06:47.752
That's what she says.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.455
Oh, my God, Jeremy.

06:50.523 --> 06:53.091
What does thumbs up, question mark mean?

06:53.158 --> 06:55.059
Thanks, skids, love you, B.

06:55.127 --> 06:57.762
Jeremy's totally thinking about me.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.163
Yeah, dude, I think he thinks about you.

06:59.231 --> 07:00.564
I think he (bleep) likes you.

07:00.632 --> 07:03.034
He jerks off to you all the
time, I sense those things.

07:03.102 --> 07:05.469
I know sexual tension when I feel it...

07:05.537 --> 07:07.805
Yeah, you do.

07:07.873 --> 07:09.306
Oh, my God...

07:09.374 --> 07:10.908
Will you leave me alone?

07:10.976 --> 07:12.476
We have to change your gauze out.

07:12.544 --> 07:13.677
Oh.

07:13.746 --> 07:15.011
I wanna go to Florida.

07:17.885 --> 07:20.120
Okay, Jaimé.

07:20.188 --> 07:22.989
Okay, everything is now
the childproof, we got this.

07:23.057 --> 07:27.127
Abbi is weak right now,
like a baby, like an infant.

07:27.195 --> 07:29.062
And I need to take care of her.

07:29.130 --> 07:32.031
And I need you to take care of me.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.934
Baby, I will like anticipate
your every single need.

07:35.002 --> 07:38.270
Okay, first order of business
is government medicine.

07:38.338 --> 07:42.208
Abbi needs to take two
Vicodin every four hours.

07:42.275 --> 07:44.711
Ah, good.

07:44.778 --> 07:47.113
What, now?

07:47.180 --> 07:48.781
Okay, Abbi, this little airplane

07:48.849 --> 07:50.816
is going to come into the hangar.

07:50.883 --> 07:53.285
Yes... okay, now close the hangar.

07:53.353 --> 07:54.487
Oh, you're so swollen, baby.

07:54.554 --> 07:56.155
Okay.

07:56.223 --> 07:57.889
Okay. Peas, frozen peas.

07:59.559 --> 08:03.195
Here we go, here we go, here we go now.

08:03.263 --> 08:06.732
Wow, it's been four hours already?

08:06.799 --> 08:09.701
Oh, my God, you are so out of it.

08:09.769 --> 08:11.402
I am really glad I'm here.

08:11.770 --> 08:12.604
Okay.

08:12.672 --> 08:16.207
Okay, this is for the
swelling of your face.

08:16.275 --> 08:17.709
Just rest on it.

08:17.777 --> 08:19.778
Okay, Jaimé, now, we have to
do the two most important things

08:19.846 --> 08:20.946
a dental surgery victim needs.

08:21.014 --> 08:22.280
What is it?

08:22.348 --> 08:24.182
- Give her Froyo and braid her hair.
- Of course.

08:24.250 --> 08:27.018
Okay, I need you to go 42 Squirts,

08:27.085 --> 08:28.253
and get me a real Abbi flavor.

08:29.355 --> 08:30.288
You'll know when you see it.

08:30.356 --> 08:32.789
Ooh-whee, okay, well, okay.

08:32.857 --> 08:34.491
The flavor of Abbi.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.027
Can Jaimé capture the complexity

08:36.094 --> 08:38.095
of this beautiful human
being in one single flavor?

08:38.164 --> 08:39.328
Jaimé, I don't really have time for this.

08:39.397 --> 08:41.097
Abbi's blood mother is in Turks and Caicos,

08:41.166 --> 08:42.599
and I am her mother now.

08:42.668 --> 08:45.636
She needs me, she needs,
you know, us, but...

08:45.704 --> 08:47.204
I will not disappoint you.

08:47.272 --> 08:48.572
Okay, baby.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.941
And, hey, Jaimés.

08:51.009 --> 08:52.276
Have fun with it.

08:55.246 --> 08:58.549
Are you ready to get on the party train.

08:58.616 --> 08:59.849
First stop!

08:59.917 --> 09:03.554
Braid the (bleep) out of
them silky-ass doll locks.

09:03.621 --> 09:05.289
Ow. I'm gonna get some scrunchies.

09:07.225 --> 09:09.159
Okay, Jaimé, the flavor of Abbi.

09:27.244 --> 09:28.977
Oh, (bleep) me.

09:29.045 --> 09:30.446
I guess I'll start from the top.

09:34.150 --> 09:35.551
Would you rather lick a dead man's penis,

09:35.619 --> 09:37.553
or have sex with the same
person for the rest of your life?

09:37.621 --> 09:38.987
Penis.

09:39.055 --> 09:40.889
Would you rather eat ice
cream for five hours straight,

09:40.957 --> 09:42.558
or shoot somebody in the knee?

09:42.626 --> 09:43.559
Knee.

09:43.627 --> 09:44.893
Yup.

09:44.961 --> 09:47.362
Ilana, I don't feel
good, I feel really weird.

09:47.430 --> 09:48.396
I knew it.

09:48.464 --> 09:51.200
Western medicine fails us again.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.335
Thanks a lot, Doctor Oz.

09:53.402 --> 09:54.536
You know what?

09:54.604 --> 09:56.438
I'm gonna give you a
little bit of my homemade

09:56.505 --> 09:58.673
"Strega Nona" recipe.

09:58.742 --> 09:59.942
Strega Nona...

10:01.777 --> 10:03.077
Firecrackers, baby.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.178
What's a firecracker?

10:04.247 --> 10:05.413
It was what we were on that time that

10:05.481 --> 10:08.550
that dude jerked off on your
pocketbook in Bryant Park.

10:08.618 --> 10:09.851
He was cool.

10:09.918 --> 10:12.120
But not as cool as Jeremy, right?

10:50.224 --> 10:51.524
You know what, Jeremy?

10:51.592 --> 10:55.628
I will say it again.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.831
I like you.

10:57.899 --> 10:59.599
I want us to go out and...

10:59.667 --> 11:00.867
- What are you doing?
- Just be open with it.

11:00.935 --> 11:02.068
What are you doing?

11:02.136 --> 11:03.904
I'm telling Jeremy I like him.

11:03.971 --> 11:05.105
- You told me to.
- What?

11:05.173 --> 11:08.741
- 23 minutes, (bleep) me.
- You told me to.

11:08.809 --> 11:11.744
Yeah, but not while you're
jacked-up on Uncle Sam pills.

11:11.812 --> 11:13.646
Jesus, come on.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.316
Take this firecracker smoothie.

11:16.383 --> 11:17.450
All right.

11:18.485 --> 11:20.353
Ow.

11:20.421 --> 11:21.754
Ow.

11:21.822 --> 11:24.623
You know, I wish I could have
one, but I gotta be responsible.

11:24.691 --> 11:26.758
And don't you worry about
leaving that message for Jeremy.

11:26.827 --> 11:28.894
You are gonna forget that in seven minutes.

11:31.264 --> 11:32.364
Jaimé?

11:32.432 --> 11:33.966
Okay.

11:34.034 --> 11:36.268
No, please, can you go in front of me?

11:36.336 --> 11:38.170
Please, thank you.

11:38.238 --> 11:40.306
Eh, toppings, toppings, toppings, toppings,

11:40.373 --> 11:41.906
toppings, toppings, toppings...

11:43.609 --> 11:45.076
Let's see, Cap'n Crunch?

11:45.144 --> 11:47.579
No, it's too chemically and that's no good.

11:47.647 --> 11:49.080
Dark chocolate chip?

11:49.148 --> 11:51.049
No, it's too crunchy for Abbi right now.

11:51.116 --> 11:52.317
Ew, gummy candies?

11:52.385 --> 11:54.453
Excuse me, these do not go with the Froyo.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.955
In case you were wondering.

11:57.022 --> 11:59.457
Gorp... what is Gorp?

11:59.524 --> 12:01.125
"Good ol' raisins and peanuts ."

12:01.193 --> 12:04.662
Why would we want all raisins and peanuts?

12:04.730 --> 12:07.765
Aye, aye.

12:07.833 --> 12:11.135

Namaste, children of light.

12:25.417 --> 12:28.519
Welcome to another installment
of "How To With Dr. Whiz."

12:28.587 --> 12:31.321
Today, I'm gonna show you
how to meditate proper...

12:31.389 --> 12:33.757
Ilana, what the (bleep) that!

12:33.824 --> 12:34.958
It's Abbi.

12:35.026 --> 12:37.027
I am killing this mom-slash-nurse thing.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.595
Doesn't she look gorgeous?

12:38.662 --> 12:39.763
I would think that you could surmise

12:39.830 --> 12:42.599
from my initial reaction that she doesn't.

12:42.666 --> 12:43.934
She needs rest, Ilana.

12:44.002 --> 12:46.403
Okay, Jeez, you're the
one who's being loud.

12:49.707 --> 12:50.807
You know what?

12:50.875 --> 12:52.609
I deserve a break.

12:52.676 --> 12:57.547
You wanna show me your old
LL Cool J, your Lincoln Log?

12:57.615 --> 12:58.748
No!

12:58.816 --> 13:00.316
I'll show you my tah-tahs.

13:00.384 --> 13:01.918
Yes.

13:01.985 --> 13:03.452
Yes!

13:03.520 --> 13:06.255
Show me your penis.

13:10.093 --> 13:13.462
Oh, goodie, you're awake!

13:13.530 --> 13:16.632
We're gonna have so much fun!

13:16.699 --> 13:20.068
Let's go play outside.

13:20.136 --> 13:22.037
Come on, Abbi!

13:23.473 --> 13:26.842
Man, I hate to see it, but
you got boyfriend penis, bro.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.412
Dude, check this out.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.815
I made my torso a face.

13:32.882 --> 13:34.149
Do you know who it is?

13:34.216 --> 13:36.651
I'm guessing an old person
'cause the eyes are low

13:36.718 --> 13:39.487
and swinging and drooping,

13:39.555 --> 13:41.389
but in a way that makes me hard.

13:41.457 --> 13:45.726
I never thought that a old
people face would make me hard.

13:45.794 --> 13:46.828
That's nice to know.

13:46.895 --> 13:47.929
You are gonna be an old dude

13:47.997 --> 13:50.966
with so many boners in a non-creepy way.

13:51.033 --> 13:52.033
That's hot.

13:53.068 --> 13:54.368
Okay, who is it?

13:54.436 --> 13:55.570
Do you know which old person it is?

13:55.637 --> 13:56.838
I don't know, who is it?

13:56.905 --> 13:58.172
I... I don't know.

13:58.239 --> 13:59.674
Do you know?

13:59.741 --> 14:01.476
What are we doing here? Who did you draw?

14:01.543 --> 14:02.977
No, I don't know.

14:03.044 --> 14:04.278
Maybe Abbi'll know.

14:04.346 --> 14:06.013
Hey! Abbi, wake up, Ab!

14:06.081 --> 14:08.583
Ilana, let her sleep, let her rest.

14:08.650 --> 14:11.418
Ab? Abbi?

14:11.486 --> 14:13.454
Abbi?!

14:13.521 --> 14:14.388
Abbi!

14:16.191 --> 14:17.425
She's just gone.

14:17.493 --> 14:18.526
The door was wide open.

14:18.594 --> 14:20.495
It's gonna get dark in a couple hours.

14:20.562 --> 14:22.062
Okay, calm down.

14:22.131 --> 14:23.264
you, don't tell me to calm down!

14:23.332 --> 14:24.599
I hate when men tell women that.

14:24.666 --> 14:26.000
Okay, I'm sure she's fine.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.369
Just needed some air or
something, just call her.

14:28.437 --> 14:30.437
I can't, I took her phone away.

14:30.505 --> 14:32.773
She called Jeremy to declare her love,

14:32.841 --> 14:34.341
and my brain's been a dud all day.

14:34.408 --> 14:36.010
I haven't smoked once, I didn't even vape.

14:36.077 --> 14:37.978
This is all my fault.

14:38.046 --> 14:40.814
Okay, if you can keep her on her
meds schedule, she'll be okay.

14:40.882 --> 14:43.150
She'll be a little fuzzy, but
at least she'll be coherent.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.285
I lied, I (bleep) lied, dude!

14:45.353 --> 14:47.320
I gave her the strongest
form of weed possible.

14:47.388 --> 14:48.488
Other than dabbing.

14:48.556 --> 14:50.257
I gotta find this bitch,
I'll talk to you later.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.891
Abbi!

14:52.259 --> 14:56.062
It's my fault, I should've seen
this coming from a mile away.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.473
Chug chug chug chug.

15:18.052 --> 15:19.218
Abbi!

15:24.123 --> 15:25.324
What is this place?

15:25.392 --> 15:28.627
Its the most magical place in all the land.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.930
Whole Foods! Wow.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.399
Yeah, the neighborhood's really changed.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.933
It's a whole new Gowanus.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.201
Come on!

15:36.268 --> 15:37.903
Let's hurry up before the lines get long!

15:41.174 --> 15:42.640
Excuse me?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.876
Hey, did you see a beautiful,
sumptuous model-type

15:44.944 --> 15:46.111
come through?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.946
Long silky hair like a horse's main?

15:48.014 --> 15:49.681
The only thing I see is that crazy woman

15:49.749 --> 15:53.017
who bought two Yoo-hoos and
drop a bottle on the floor.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.654
Yoo-hoo.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.223
Yeah, that's what I just said.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.524
Thank you so much.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.259
Get out of my store, get out of my...

16:01.327 --> 16:02.193
I'm sick and tired of this.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.194
Get out.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.161
Hey!

16:07.333 --> 16:09.399
Punk.

16:09.467 --> 16:10.667
Dick, bitch.

16:14.472 --> 16:15.439
I'm coming, Ab!

16:15.506 --> 16:16.707
Hearts of palm!

16:16.775 --> 16:18.308
Abbi, buy me that.

16:18.376 --> 16:20.044
I love hearts of palm.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.046
Whoo-whee!

16:22.114 --> 16:23.981
Ooh, bulk granola.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.416
Buy me that, Abbi.

16:26.484 --> 16:28.518
Manuka honey.

16:28.586 --> 16:30.019
So reasonably priced.

16:30.087 --> 16:32.356
Buy me that, Abbi!

16:32.423 --> 16:34.591
Oh, great!

16:34.659 --> 16:36.826
Mmm, this is some high-class (bleep).

16:36.894 --> 16:39.296
Ooh, earth-friendly cereals.

16:39.364 --> 16:40.930
Knock 'em over, Abbi.

16:40.998 --> 16:42.999
They wanna be on the ground.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.333
Whoo-hoo!

16:44.401 --> 16:48.537
Next up, probiotics, a Neti
Pot and a bag of douche.

16:48.605 --> 16:49.538
Ha-ha!

16:51.008 --> 16:52.108
Abbi!

16:54.511 --> 16:56.112
Abbi!

17:00.617 --> 17:05.053
That'll be $1,487.56.

17:05.121 --> 17:06.989
Use your new credit card, Abbi.

17:07.056 --> 17:08.357
You got it because you thought you needed

17:08.425 --> 17:10.259
more than one card to be an adult, right?

17:10.327 --> 17:13.127
Well, now's your chance to be one!

17:13.195 --> 17:16.098
Plus, you'll get Starwood's points.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.834
Mmmm, I'm so proud of you!

17:18.902 --> 17:21.603
Quick, let's get this into a
bunker before the big one hits.

17:21.671 --> 17:23.570
Abbi!

17:23.638 --> 17:24.638
Abbi Abrams!

17:26.876 --> 17:28.542
Woah...

17:30.479 --> 17:32.414
Hello?

17:32.481 --> 17:34.916
There has been some unusual
activity on your account

17:34.983 --> 17:37.485
and we'd like to confirm
that you, Abbi Abrams,

17:37.553 --> 17:42.056
made a purchase of $1,487.56

17:42.124 --> 17:44.592
at the Whole Foods in Gowanus, Brooklyn.

17:46.629 --> 17:49.396
Oh, my God, of course,
she's hungry as (bleep).

17:49.464 --> 17:52.666
From your clear answer, I
can tell you are Abbi Abrams,

17:52.734 --> 17:54.635
and this was not a fraudulent charge.

17:54.703 --> 17:57.738
Thank you for doing business
with One Trust, goodbye.

17:57.806 --> 18:01.309
♪ On the flip side you crazy bitch ♪

18:05.814 --> 18:08.582
Damn, this neighborhood is changing.

18:14.121 --> 18:16.323
Stop it, that's so inappropriate.

18:16.391 --> 18:20.126
Oh, (bleep), it's Strega
Nona the weed witch!

18:20.194 --> 18:21.794
Peace, mortals.

18:21.863 --> 18:23.964
Are you okay, you scared
the (bleep) out of me.

18:24.031 --> 18:26.532
God dammit, my manuka honey!

18:26.600 --> 18:28.268
I got you, Bingo Bronson! Abbi, no!

18:28.336 --> 18:30.270
Ow!

18:30.338 --> 18:31.437
Airball.

18:31.505 --> 18:33.206
Oh, my (bleep) ankle.

18:33.274 --> 18:36.142
Oh, my God, sorry.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.977
I love you, Abbi!

18:38.044 --> 18:39.144
See you soon.

18:39.212 --> 18:41.146
I love you, Bingo Bronson!

18:41.214 --> 18:42.982
So sorry, sorry.

18:43.049 --> 18:44.417
Oh, my God, you're so scary.

18:51.091 --> 18:52.324
So Abbi's vitals are fine.

18:52.393 --> 18:54.159
She just needs plenty of sleep.

18:54.227 --> 18:57.829
I feel like an old-timey doctor
right now making house calls.

18:57.898 --> 18:59.731
I should get an apothecary bag, right?

18:59.799 --> 19:03.969
Oh, my God, I am so
horny right now, it hurts.

19:04.037 --> 19:05.437
Oh, yeah?

19:05.505 --> 19:08.374
It hurts.

19:08.441 --> 19:10.575
Good night, Abbi-dab.

19:10.643 --> 19:13.478
Everybody safe and s...

19:13.546 --> 19:15.246
Jaimé!

19:15.314 --> 19:16.648
Are you Abbi?

19:16.716 --> 19:17.949
Where are you, Abbi?

19:18.017 --> 19:20.318
Sir? We're closing.

19:20.386 --> 19:24.088
Just pick any flavor,
they're all chemicals.

19:27.192 --> 19:28.859
Come on.

19:28.928 --> 19:29.827
So sorry.

19:32.331 --> 19:33.364
It's the Gummi Bears.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.503
Hey, Ab, hey.

19:38.571 --> 19:40.004
Oh, hey, Jer.

19:40.072 --> 19:41.305
Hi, 'sup?

19:41.374 --> 19:44.542
So... I got your call yesterday.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.411
Um, my what?

19:46.479 --> 19:49.447
That really long voice mail you
left me where you asked me out.

19:49.515 --> 19:51.249
Oh, no, don't...

19:51.316 --> 19:54.986
No, I was just in... I had
surgery, I was... so many...

19:55.053 --> 19:57.721
There were so many drugs
and I was... so that's...

19:57.789 --> 20:00.091
You know I'm getting...
my phone's ringing here.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.725
Hello? Hi.

20:01.793 --> 20:05.096
- No, why would I throw-up on my clothes?
- Abbi.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.698
- I'm not crazy... Yeah, I am Jewish...
- Abbi.

20:07.766 --> 20:09.600
- It has nothing to do with it.
- Abbi, don't.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.902
- Abbi, just listen to me.
- Abbi!

20:10.969 --> 20:11.902
- Listen!
- Listen, listen.

20:11.969 --> 20:13.871
- Hey!
- Hey!

20:13.938 --> 20:18.942
I would love to go out with
you on an official... thing.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.712
Oh, and I loved your Drew
Barrymore impersonation.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.947
Amazing.

20:34.825 --> 20:36.626
So, I guess I'll give you a call.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.495
Yeah, that was... yeah.

20:39.563 --> 20:40.463
Okay.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.233
Okay, ring her up... me.
