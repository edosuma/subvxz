06:35.429 --> 06:37.146
And vacation days?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.764
Okay, I don't know, but I'm

losing their holidays?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.486
I am just trying to do what's right.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.688
In an ideal world, everyone
would just wear labels

06:45.689 --> 06:47.523
that told us exactly how
not to offend them,

06:47.524 --> 06:48.574
but they don't.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.109

06:50.110 --> 06:52.662
If we can get everyone
to label themselves,

06:52.663 --> 06:54.113
can we have our holidays back?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.616
How on Earth do you plan to do that?

07:00.455 --> 07:01.754

07:01.755 --> 07:03.623
Uh, till what?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.791
New Year's, silly.

07:05.792 --> 07:06.959
You and Amy's date.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.344
It's not really a date.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.463
It's more vague and no official plan.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.598
Felix? She likes you.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.550
Set it up. Ask her out for real.

07:14.551 --> 07:16.469
Woo her with a grand gesture.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.971
Well, I don't think I'm
so good at the woo.

07:18.972 --> 07:23.142

I am great at the woo.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.644
Come over tonight.

07:26.563 --> 07:28.030
(CHUCKLES)

07:30.318 --> 07:32.785
At Hester, we take pride
in our differences,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.320
and that's why I'm introducing

07:34.321 --> 07:36.989
Hester's new mandatory
sensitivity census.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.074
It's easy.

07:38.075 --> 07:39.625
You just enter the identity booth

07:39.626 --> 07:42.295
and pick the labels that
best represent who you are.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.581
Be sure to wear your labels proudly

07:45.582 --> 07:47.800
so everyone can support you.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.719
And so that we can have Christmas.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.170
Is that everything?

07:51.171 --> 07:53.139
Look, I want to "ho ho ho"
as much as the next Joe,

07:53.140 --> 07:55.508
but Noah shouldn't be
forced to label himself gay

07:55.509 --> 07:56.509
if he's not ready.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.677
I don't think it counts

07:57.678 --> 07:59.228
when the person's already out.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.429
Hey, there.

08:00.430 --> 08:02.682
Gay there.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.268
Um, is that a surprise?

08:05.269 --> 08:07.103
Do I give off a straight
vibe when we kiss?

08:07.104 --> 08:09.188
(FORCED LAUGHTER) Good one.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.407
So, uh, what about tonight?
You want to come over?

08:11.408 --> 08:14.610
My mom's usually out by 9:00
after half a box of rosé.

08:14.611 --> 08:15.878
I shouldn't.

08:15.879 --> 08:17.580
Big theoretical math test tomorrow

08:17.581 --> 08:20.366
that I will theoretically fail
if I don't hit the books.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.484
Some other time?

08:21.485 --> 08:23.619
Yeah.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.254
See? You were worried for nothing.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.757
Oh, he's hiding something,
just not that he's gay.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.508
Or he just really has to study.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.793
No one at this school studies.

08:30.794 --> 08:32.378
You realize you're probably spinning out

08:32.379 --> 08:33.546
over nothing, right?

08:33.547 --> 08:34.929
Yes.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.215
But we should follow him home tonight

18:37.967 --> 18:39.715
(SIGHS) The only thing that was clear

18:39.716 --> 18:41.551
was how connected you
feel to your faith...

18:41.552 --> 18:42.935
More than I've ever been.

18:42.936 --> 18:44.770
Well, the amount of
things in here twinkling

18:44.771 --> 18:45.922
says otherwise.

18:45.923 --> 18:47.807
Yeah, but I only love Christmas

18:47.808 --> 18:49.892
because those are the
best memories I have left

18:49.893 --> 18:51.227
of my mom.

18:53.197 --> 18:54.614
Lauren...

18:54.615 --> 18:56.315
Don't try and make this a moment.

18:56.316 --> 18:58.401
I'm just saying you really have

18:58.402 --> 19:00.236
a spiritual connection to Hanukkah.

19:00.237 --> 19:01.320
But the DNA test...

19:01.321 --> 19:03.489
Who cares about a DNA test?

19:03.490 --> 19:06.409
Take it from me, biology
has very little to do

19:06.410 --> 19:07.994
with how you really feel inside.

19:07.995 --> 19:11.964
So if you feel you're
Jewish, then you're Jewish.

19:14.002 --> 19:15.585
(CHUCKLES)

19:19.307 --> 19:20.890
And at least this means

19:20.891 --> 19:23.009
your real dad might still be out there,

19:23.010 --> 19:24.810
alive.

19:34.906 --> 19:37.990
What? Tinsel is super flammable.

19:39.027 --> 19:40.326
(SIGHS)

19:40.327 --> 19:41.911
(LAUGHTER)

19:41.912 --> 19:43.829
You were just like, "You want a label?

19:43.830 --> 19:45.364
How's this for a label?"

19:45.365 --> 19:46.582
- Ugh!
- Ah!

19:46.583 --> 19:48.451
It was just so bad-ass.

19:48.452 --> 19:49.702
You're my new idol.

19:49.703 --> 19:51.537
Sorry, Ronda Rousey.
You got knocked out.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.456
It was kind of fun.

19:53.457 --> 19:54.874
Fun? It was electrifying.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.459
You stood up for what you believe in

19:56.460 --> 19:58.177
and actually inspired change

19:58.178 --> 20:01.047
in them, in me.

20:01.048 --> 20:04.300
Does that mean you still
want to find a girl to kiss?

20:04.301 --> 20:06.435
MAN: ♪ Yeah, I'll come running ♪

20:06.436 --> 20:08.354
I think I already found one.

20:08.355 --> 20:12.274
MAN: ♪ Everybody wants
something for nothing ♪

20:12.275 --> 20:13.943
Okay, I'm doing this myself this time.

20:13.944 --> 20:15.561
You cannot participate.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.530
I'm just here for support.

20:17.531 --> 20:19.115
And curiosity.

20:19.116 --> 20:21.024
Don't worry, I'll hide
behind this bush...

20:21.025 --> 20:23.232
<i>MAN: ♪ When things go away</i>

20:23.233 --> 20:25.331
