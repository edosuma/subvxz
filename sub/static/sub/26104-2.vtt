WEBVTT

00:04.730 --> 00:07.166
EZ: Previously
on Mayans M.C....

00:07.199 --> 00:08.734
BISHOP: We finished fitting
out the prospect?

00:08.768 --> 00:10.736
HANK: Cop ended up being dirty.

00:10.770 --> 00:13.839
DA shaved off six years.
I like the kid.

00:13.873 --> 00:15.575
HANK: He's smart.

00:15.608 --> 00:17.710
You killed a cop.
Your deal was a gift.

00:17.743 --> 00:19.979
EZ: What I signed up for was
feeding you intel on Galindo.

00:20.012 --> 00:21.581
Only Galindo.

00:21.614 --> 00:23.849
My brother, the M.C.,
nothing touches them.

00:23.883 --> 00:25.551
We need you on
this Vegas run.

00:25.585 --> 00:27.286
Whatever the club needs.

00:33.192 --> 00:34.494
Move!

00:34.527 --> 00:36.261
Do you know whose shit
you're jacking here?

00:36.295 --> 00:37.663
BISHOP: The Galindo cartel.

00:37.697 --> 00:39.599
Your job was
to protect my shipment.

00:39.632 --> 00:41.133
You failed.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.803
GALINDO: Now you are
responsible for the loss.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.606
GALINDO: Kill the devil.
Resurrect Mexico.

00:46.639 --> 00:47.740
It was the rebels.

00:47.773 --> 00:49.174
BISHOP: Los Olvidados.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.043
GALINDO: Someone gave them
the details.

00:51.076 --> 00:52.878
Dogwood Crew would be
the first to see any change

00:52.912 --> 00:54.514
on the street.

00:54.547 --> 00:55.948
BISHOP: Reach out to Louie
first thing in the morning.

00:55.981 --> 00:58.484
Let's see if anyone knows
this rebel bitch.

00:58.518 --> 01:00.019
You're the traitor.

01:00.052 --> 01:02.021
If the Mayans want a future,
we gotta be in front

01:02.054 --> 01:03.389
of that change,
and Adelita's the only

01:03.423 --> 01:04.457
way to do that.

01:04.490 --> 01:05.625
Do you have our package?

01:05.658 --> 01:07.693
GILLY: All twelve keys.

01:18.838 --> 01:25.711
*

01:26.145 --> 01:27.447
MAN:

01:27.480 --> 01:33.986

01:43.429 --> 01:49.435

01:51.771 --> 01:53.038
EMILY: I can get you
whatever you want.

01:55.074 --> 01:59.512
EMILY: Not my baby.

02:01.213 --> 02:05.084
Oh, please.
Please, he's just a baby.

02:14.794 --> 02:15.761
*

02:15.795 --> 02:18.831
EMILY: No, no!
Please.

02:18.864 --> 02:20.633
Fuck you.

02:38.818 --> 02:41.220
No! Stop, stop!

02:42.254 --> 02:44.389
Stop!

02:48.127 --> 02:51.564
EMILY:
Stop!

02:55.501 --> 03:02.341
*

03:03.108 --> 03:05.778
* Mother of exiles

03:05.811 --> 03:07.947
* The torch of hope

03:07.980 --> 03:10.482
* In the toss of the tempest

03:10.516 --> 03:13.385
* Threw us medicine's rope

03:13.418 --> 03:16.956
* But the brazen giant

03:16.989 --> 03:18.924
* With limbs astride

03:18.958 --> 03:21.961
* Blocks the golden door

03:21.994 --> 03:24.764
* To the US of lies

03:24.797 --> 03:26.031
* Screaming

03:26.065 --> 03:29.602
* Damn your huddled masses

03:29.635 --> 03:32.972
* Scrub our floors

03:33.005 --> 03:35.608
* Cut our grasses

03:35.641 --> 03:38.177
* I am a wolf

03:38.210 --> 03:41.080
* A wild cur

03:41.113 --> 03:44.149
* Cut from the pack

03:44.183 --> 03:46.919
* With blood on my fur

03:46.952 --> 03:49.521
* Every howl

03:49.555 --> 03:52.324
* Marks the dead

03:52.357 --> 03:55.895
* 'Cause a beaten dog

03:55.928 --> 03:57.529

04:05.137 --> 04:12.011
*

04:23.022 --> 04:29.895
*

04:44.744 --> 04:48.247
TAZA: Not a gangster in sight.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.217
-It was dark.

04:54.053 --> 04:55.354
I think Louie's
old lady still lives

04:55.387 --> 04:56.889
above the barber shop.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.505
-No.

05:46.238 --> 05:47.439
ANGEL: Hey, Louie.

05:55.681 --> 05:58.283
COCO: Anybody home?

06:06.458 --> 06:07.592
-Shit!

06:07.626 --> 06:09.962
BOY: Get out!

06:09.995 --> 06:11.731
Get out of here!

06:11.764 --> 06:13.432
The fuck's the matter with you,
you crazy little shit?

06:13.465 --> 06:16.101
BOY: Are you gonna kill me?
COCO: I should.

06:16.135 --> 06:17.970
EZ: Hey, what's going on?
BOY: I'm sorry.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.571
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

06:20.840 --> 06:23.108
You need help there, brother?
Should we call for some backup?

06:23.142 --> 06:24.343
COCO: That shit stings.

06:24.376 --> 06:25.644
That shit could have
fucking pierced

06:25.677 --> 06:28.180
-my eardrum or something.

06:28.213 --> 06:32.584
Looks like a 45 caliber Hasbro.

06:32.617 --> 06:35.120
-You're lucky to be alive.

06:35.154 --> 06:37.489
It's all right.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.491
-Yeah.

06:40.893 --> 06:42.694
Why'd you shoot at us?

06:42.728 --> 06:44.696
Pop said you were
gonna kill him.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.301
EZ: No one wants
to hurt your pops.

06:49.334 --> 06:52.237
Or you.
We just wanna talk to him.

06:53.272 --> 06:54.306
You know where he is?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.613
Don't you use this thing,
you hear me?

07:01.646 --> 07:03.382
It'll get you killed.

07:07.019 --> 07:09.221
If you're gonna point
a gun at somebody,

07:09.254 --> 07:11.623
you make sure it's real.
And loaded.

07:13.092 --> 07:14.326
ANGEL: Yeah, that's really
good advice to give

07:14.359 --> 07:16.728
-to a seven-year-old, man.

07:16.762 --> 07:19.664
I had to shoot my crazy
uncle Gomez in '06.

07:19.698 --> 07:21.166
TAZA: Of course you did.

07:53.799 --> 07:54.900
-Hmm.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.495
Mmm.

08:23.528 --> 08:26.531
-Gracias, Mama.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.433
Yes.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.236
-She's resting.

08:31.270 --> 08:32.437
Like you should be.

08:33.605 --> 08:35.807
I thought you were gonna
get some sleep, amor.

08:35.841 --> 08:38.110
I can't sleep.
Is there anything?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.779
Not yet.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.647
DEVANTE:
We have new information

08:42.681 --> 08:44.816
on the car and the plate.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.852
It will be very helpful.

08:46.886 --> 08:48.820
GALINDO: Let's, uh...
Let's get some air.

08:59.965 --> 09:01.733
What do we do, Miguel?

09:01.766 --> 09:04.603
Listen, I am not gonna let
anything happen to our son.

09:04.636 --> 09:06.438
-And we'll get him back.

09:06.471 --> 09:09.574
You can't go to the police.
Not here on the US side.

09:09.608 --> 09:11.343
Los Olvidados have
no network here.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.045
And they'll have
to go back to Mexico.

09:13.078 --> 09:14.980
Nestor's already reached
out to our people.

09:15.014 --> 09:17.449
-Policia, Federales--

09:17.482 --> 09:20.285
We'll put the MC on it.
Get our mayor to help.

09:24.123 --> 09:28.360
This...fight with the rebels,

09:28.393 --> 09:30.162
it is part of your other world.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.297
And I know the rules.
Don't ask questions.

09:32.331 --> 09:35.034
But now that world has
crashed into my world.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.535
And that was not
supposed to happen.

09:36.568 --> 09:40.139
-I know.
-So now I ask questions.

09:40.172 --> 09:42.374
And I need to know the truth,
Miguel.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.644
Everything that happens.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.114
I will.

09:49.148 --> 09:50.815
I promise.

09:50.849 --> 09:53.685
You'll know everything.
I'm so sorry, corazón.

10:24.483 --> 10:26.351
GALINDO:

11:00.585 --> 11:03.555
-Couldn't find him.

11:03.588 --> 11:05.257
Weren't on the streets,
at the bar...

11:05.290 --> 11:08.627
Apparently Louie thinks
we're trying to kill him.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.962
-Louie's kid.

11:10.996 --> 11:12.797
After he nearly took
my fucking eye out.

11:12.831 --> 11:15.067
Are you seriously still
talking about that?

11:15.100 --> 11:17.569
Caballeros.

11:17.602 --> 11:18.803
Preciosa.

11:21.573 --> 11:22.841
Haven't seen you
boys in a while.

11:22.874 --> 11:25.044
-Grace of God.

11:25.077 --> 11:27.812
So what brings
you to Wonderland?

11:27.846 --> 11:30.482
There might be a new
player trying to move in.

11:30.515 --> 11:33.118
From over the fence.

11:33.152 --> 11:34.819
Heroin?

11:36.421 --> 11:38.423
GRACIE:
I haven't heard anything.

11:38.457 --> 11:40.325
RIZ: Any spike in your
patient intake?

11:40.359 --> 11:42.661
OD's felt a stronger push?

11:42.694 --> 11:44.329
GRACIE: Not really.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.069
GRACIE: This is about average.

11:56.708 --> 11:58.677
WOMAN:

12:03.348 --> 12:05.450
GILLY:

12:06.418 --> 12:08.087
All right.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.454
Let us know if
you hear anything.

12:09.488 --> 12:10.489
Of course.

12:11.823 --> 12:13.792
BISHOP: A little donation.

12:13.825 --> 12:15.460
I hope it helps.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.962
Gracias.

12:17.996 --> 12:20.365
Our pleasure, sweetheart.

12:22.201 --> 12:26.238
COCO: Hey, Gracie,
he's Dogwood, ain't he?

12:26.271 --> 12:27.406
Yeah, Tito.

12:28.473 --> 12:29.474
Why?

12:30.742 --> 12:33.945
-Soon.

12:33.978 --> 12:35.547
COCO: Can you make it sooner?

12:38.683 --> 12:41.786
GRACIE: That soon enough?
BISHOP: You're a goddess.

12:43.488 --> 12:44.589
All right.
Yeah.

12:44.623 --> 12:48.860
*

12:48.893 --> 12:50.829
-Go, go!
COCO: Yo, Louie!

12:50.862 --> 12:54.166
HANK: What's that about?
ANGEL: Hey, we got this.

12:54.199 --> 12:55.567
*

12:55.600 --> 12:58.803
BISHOP:
Stupid fucking gangsters.

12:58.837 --> 13:02.841
* The politicians
be condemned *

13:02.874 --> 13:06.545
* No streets no walls
so down they'll fall *

13:06.578 --> 13:07.912
* See them run
point the finger *

13:07.946 --> 13:10.115
* Pass away

13:10.149 --> 13:14.052
* But I have got to see this
world as just as our own *

13:14.085 --> 13:15.887
* 'Cause I have got
to see this world *

13:15.920 --> 13:18.056
* Just as our own

13:18.089 --> 13:19.724
* 'Cause I have got
to see this world *

13:19.758 --> 13:21.893
* Just as our own

13:21.926 --> 13:26.165
* 'Cause I have gone on living
in a world of my own *

13:26.198 --> 13:30.535
* We found a place
we know we've got a home *

13:30.569 --> 13:32.671
Fuck me.

13:35.474 --> 13:36.608
*

13:36.641 --> 13:41.946
-Ooh.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.115
*

13:49.288 --> 13:51.756
LOUIE:

13:51.790 --> 13:53.258
-Oh!

13:53.292 --> 13:55.227
How was your visit
to the Upside Down?

13:55.260 --> 13:57.229
Fucking terrifying.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.268
Hey.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.604
BISHOP:
Why'd you run, Louie?

14:07.506 --> 14:10.642
I didn't--I didn't know she
was your baby sister, Coco.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.277
She came in with one
of our other girls

14:12.311 --> 14:16.215
and said she was 21.
I had her do a few scenes.

14:16.248 --> 14:18.016
-Yeah.

14:18.049 --> 14:20.585
After I uploaded the shit,
she comes at me all pissed off

14:20.619 --> 14:22.287
'cause I paid her friend
a higher rate.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.555
You know, anal pays more.
Everyone knows that.

14:23.588 --> 14:24.823
Mmm.

14:24.856 --> 14:26.525
LOUIE: That's when she
showed me her ID

14:26.558 --> 14:28.960
and I saw the name on it, man.
Saw that she was only 16.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.094
LOUIE: Said she was gonna
tell you, man.

14:30.128 --> 14:32.431
Have the club cut off my balls.

14:32.464 --> 14:34.833
By then,
the clips were everywhere.

14:36.235 --> 14:38.169
I'm sorry.
I fucked up, man.

14:38.203 --> 14:40.339
My baby sister?

14:40.372 --> 14:42.040
That's fucking wrong, man.

14:42.073 --> 14:43.808
You should put
a bullet in his head.

14:43.842 --> 14:44.976
-Hold on.

14:49.013 --> 14:54.286
Look, Dogwood Crew
has always been a friend.

14:54.319 --> 14:56.888
We let you deal,
we take our cut.

14:56.921 --> 14:58.857
We don't wanna fuck with that.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.292
Neither do we.

15:00.325 --> 15:01.826
Where we at?
12%?

15:03.695 --> 15:06.130
BISHOP: Until Coco's
pain subsides,

15:06.164 --> 15:07.499
our cut doubles.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.335
Well, fuck, Bishop,
that--that's like...

15:10.369 --> 15:13.438
-24%.

15:13.472 --> 15:16.341
No, no, I mean... Yeah.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.643
Anyone new been trying
to unload product?

15:18.677 --> 15:20.379
HANK: Maybe a woman?
Latina?

15:20.412 --> 15:22.113
Another source?

15:22.146 --> 15:23.214
No.

15:23.248 --> 15:24.749
Why?

15:24.783 --> 15:27.786
Might be an independent
trying to step up.

15:27.819 --> 15:30.355
Need you to dig around a bit.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.991
Dunes, El Centro.

15:33.024 --> 15:34.726
Okay.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.411
-Fucking dumbass.

15:52.444 --> 15:55.547
I got two sisters, man.
Both older than me.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.048
And beards thicker
than Gilly's.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.284
all:

15:59.318 --> 16:02.721
-I have no idea.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.356
-Sometimes the Mayan gods

16:04.389 --> 16:06.224
deliver gifts to
their faithful warriors.

16:06.257 --> 16:09.361
Ah, bukkake.
The god of money shots.

16:10.462 --> 16:12.464
RIZ: Hey, guys.

16:12.497 --> 16:15.033
It's Alvarez.

16:15.066 --> 16:16.868
Galindo wants to meet.

16:16.901 --> 16:19.103
Don't sound good.

16:37.656 --> 16:44.563
*

17:14.693 --> 17:16.795
Who's the entourage?

17:16.828 --> 17:19.398
ANGEL: Old guy was El Galindo's
conserjero,

17:19.431 --> 17:21.900
helping the Ivy Leaguer
stay on Daddy's path.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.635
Devante's a serious
fucking dude.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.269
ANGEL: Yeah.

17:25.303 --> 17:26.838
And the mercenary
with cornrows?

17:26.871 --> 17:28.139
He's a mercenary
in cornrows.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.441
both:

17:29.474 --> 17:31.510
Nestor Oceteva.
Grew up on this side.

17:31.543 --> 17:33.111
Got some kind
of family connection.

17:33.144 --> 17:35.747
Galindo's head of security.

17:41.152 --> 17:43.988
Last night...

17:44.022 --> 17:49.461
Los Olvidados crossed over the
border and attacked my family.

17:49.494 --> 17:52.964
They killed one of my men.

17:52.997 --> 17:56.234
And kidnapped my son.

17:56.267 --> 17:58.236
Emily?

18:01.305 --> 18:03.742
Unharmed.

18:05.243 --> 18:07.145
GALINDO:
She got a look at the car.

18:07.178 --> 18:09.113
It's not likely they
stayed on the US side,

18:09.147 --> 18:12.316
but if they did,
I need you to track them down.

18:18.823 --> 18:20.224
ANGEL:

18:20.258 --> 18:24.195
I'm asking this
as a personal favor.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.329
Please.

18:32.537 --> 18:35.006
Sorry about your son.

18:35.039 --> 18:36.174
We'll help.

18:42.213 --> 18:44.683
We're looking for
a Ford station wagon.

18:44.716 --> 18:47.486
Probably mid '80s.
Dirty yellow.

18:47.519 --> 18:50.455
Partial plates.
Baja, letter Q.

18:50.489 --> 18:52.691
NESTOR:
Last two numbers are 47.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.864
BISHOP:
We'll put it on the street.

18:59.898 --> 19:01.800
Start looking in
the obvious places.

19:01.833 --> 19:04.202
We'll have Peña run it
through the system.

19:04.235 --> 19:05.837
If they're on
this side of the fence,

19:05.870 --> 19:08.239
we'll find out where they are.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.608
-Gracias.
-De nada.

19:17.716 --> 19:19.518
We'll catch up with you.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.557
You handled that right, primo.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.391
Like I had a fucking choice.

19:33.164 --> 19:34.966
COCO: Did you know about this?

19:34.999 --> 19:36.868
She don't tell me anything
unless we're involved.

19:36.901 --> 19:39.203
Guess what, brother?
We're involved.

19:41.172 --> 19:42.574
That's Emily's kid.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.382
I saw the car
when we were chasing Dogwood.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.685
EZ: Yeah.

19:53.718 --> 19:55.787
In a ditch.
Not far from the dog kennel.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.255
Come on, man.

19:57.288 --> 19:58.757
We blew through there
going 60 miles an hour.

19:58.790 --> 20:00.792
FEQ2147, Baja plates.

20:02.961 --> 20:04.563
This time keep
that shit to yourself.

20:04.596 --> 20:05.964
What about the kid?

20:08.967 --> 20:11.269
I'll make a call to Adelita,
see what the fuck's going on.

20:26.317 --> 20:28.519
This was posted
40 minutes ago.

20:28.553 --> 20:31.222
It's already gone viral.

21:50.301 --> 21:52.203
Same speech with the link.

21:54.405 --> 21:55.573
GALINDO:
Where'd you find these?

21:56.775 --> 21:57.976
Everywhere.

22:02.246 --> 22:05.249
(distant food
truck music plays)

22:21.132 --> 22:22.701
Esta bien.

22:43.688 --> 22:47.658
*

22:50.929 --> 22:52.563
EZ: I got that, Pa.

22:52.596 --> 22:53.732
Thanks.

22:55.633 --> 22:57.869
You handing off
a bag for Jimenez?

22:57.902 --> 23:01.740
EZ: No, I didn't see him.
I have to talk to him.

23:03.407 --> 23:06.778
-I have a, uh, situation.

23:07.779 --> 23:09.981
Situation.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.482
I hate those.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.351
Come on, I'm gonna handle
this one, Pop, okay?

23:13.384 --> 23:14.853
Just make the call.
Have him meet me here tonight.

23:14.886 --> 23:16.187
Hold on.

23:26.597 --> 23:30.001
EZ: I can't.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.070
I don't wanna bring you in
any more than I already have.

23:32.103 --> 23:33.972
I'm all you got, son.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.575
Every time you
go ring his bell,

23:37.608 --> 23:39.710
when you got
a problem with this,

23:39.744 --> 23:44.048
Jimenez is gonna own you.
You can't need him.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.551
It's gonna fucking
twist you up, man.

23:47.585 --> 23:49.921
Make you doubt
everything that you trust.

23:52.857 --> 23:56.260
All that bad shit,
I can handle.

23:56.294 --> 23:57.728
The drugs, the violence...

23:59.230 --> 24:00.431
But Angel...

24:03.034 --> 24:06.304
I forgot how much I missed him.
And how--how much I love him.

24:07.705 --> 24:10.608
That love ain't gonna change,
Ezekiel.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.952
This vigilante group, rebels...

24:22.620 --> 24:24.222
They're pushing back
on Galindo.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.058
Complicating shit
for the cartel and the club.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.227
Last night they
kidnapped Emily's son.

24:30.561 --> 24:32.030
Jesus.

24:32.063 --> 24:33.397
And I don't know
what to do, Pop.

24:36.234 --> 24:38.302
I can't let anything
happen to that kid.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.304
Hey.

24:42.907 --> 24:45.443
You're in this now.
No getting out.

24:45.476 --> 24:48.179
Not until the DEA
gets what it wants.

24:51.749 --> 24:53.784
I know.

24:53.818 --> 24:55.686
And knowing doesn't
make you safe.

24:57.488 --> 24:59.423
You gotta feed it.
Live it.

24:59.457 --> 25:00.724
Earn trust.

25:00.758 --> 25:03.561
If not,
they're gonna skin you alive.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.340
NESTOR:
We got something.

26:23.807 --> 26:24.976
Hear that music
in the background?

26:25.009 --> 26:27.045
-Mmm.
-Tracked it down.

26:27.078 --> 26:28.679
A street vendor.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.982
He had to have been close
enough to see something.

26:31.015 --> 26:33.051
NESTOR:
He may be a part of it.

26:33.084 --> 26:35.286
-Pick him up.
-Already did.

26:36.354 --> 26:37.421
He's on the pew.

Uh, hey, Chuckie,
I need to make a call.

27:04.182 --> 27:05.583
Absolutamente.

27:05.616 --> 27:08.419
*

27:08.452 --> 27:13.524

no cigarette in my mouth *

alcohol in my blood *

27:21.632 --> 27:26.170

to figure this one out *

27:30.108 --> 27:34.412

27:34.445 --> 27:38.249
* And now I know without
a shadow of a doubt *

are wide open *

what this is?

BISHOP: He didn't say.

28:32.136 --> 28:34.805
COCO: Rebels?
ALVAREZ: Hope so.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.674
Get this shit behind us.

*

29:24.021 --> 29:25.556
What is this?

29:25.589 --> 29:27.891
GALINDO: We heard his food
truck in the rebel video.

29:27.925 --> 29:29.427
Saw who it was.

29:37.568 --> 29:39.237
What the fuck, man?

29:39.270 --> 29:40.538
There a reason why you got us
watching this shit?

29:40.571 --> 29:42.673
The reason?
What, you want a reason?

29:42.706 --> 29:47.245
Because this greasy fucking
peasant saw who took my son.

29:51.982 --> 29:54.618
GALINDO: There something
you wanna say?

29:54.652 --> 29:57.821
No, go ahead.
Speak up, Prospect.

30:06.730 --> 30:08.332
I said, "Maybe if you didn't
treat them like greasy

30:08.366 --> 30:10.901
fucking peasants,
you'd still have your son."

30:15.906 --> 30:17.775
We'll handle it.

30:24.815 --> 30:26.150
Get the boy.

30:39.062 --> 30:41.399
-Papa.
-No.

30:50.608 --> 30:52.543
Yeah?

30:52.576 --> 30:55.813
No, no, no, no!

30:55.846 --> 30:57.181
-Fuck me.
-That was Dogwood.

30:57.215 --> 30:58.382

the station wagon.

30:58.416 --> 30:59.983
Where?

31:00.017 --> 31:02.119
ANGEL: Near the dog shelter.
Over by the canal.

31:04.622 --> 31:06.257
Let us run this down

31:06.290 --> 31:07.858
before you do
anything else here.

31:07.891 --> 31:11.195
All right?
See what he gives us.

31:23.507 --> 31:24.875
Go with them.

31:24.908 --> 31:26.977
I want you to turn
over every stone, anyone,

31:27.010 --> 31:29.380
anything.
I want answers.

announcements)

31:47.598 --> 31:50.901
Sorry, Bish, Padrino.
I just...

31:52.370 --> 31:53.537
Fuck.

31:54.838 --> 31:55.906
I know I gotta leave
history behind--

31:55.939 --> 31:57.441
Shut up, Prospect.

32:01.512 --> 32:02.480

of babes, huh?

32:08.218 --> 32:10.388

the raincoat on, man.

32:14.925 --> 32:16.827

32:16.860 --> 32:18.061
-Check the back.
-Esta bien.

32:20.097 --> 32:22.866
-Send Peña the plates.
-They were jacked.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.403
-Tags are from 2010.
-It doesn't matter.

32:25.436 --> 32:27.771
Anything we can give Galindo
might slow down the carnage.

32:27.805 --> 32:29.239
All right.

Shit.

Don't lie to me, bitch.

as insurance.

coming after them.

out of touch with reality.

35:09.533 --> 35:11.334

Chaotic.

organized.

they shot Gabriel in the head.

42:18.428 --> 42:20.497
EMILY: Hey.

42:20.530 --> 42:22.832
EMILY: Sweetheart.

42:22.866 --> 42:24.734
Miguel?

42:26.003 --> 42:27.004
Miguel.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.313
-Leave him be.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.215
-Why is he--
-He's exhausted.

42:39.282 --> 42:40.483
Let him rest.

42:40.517 --> 42:42.019
*

42:42.052 --> 42:44.621
Come and help me make dinner.
We all have to eat.

42:44.654 --> 42:51.528
*

43:08.078 --> 43:10.580
ADELITA: We shouldn't be
meeting in public.

43:10.613 --> 43:12.849
ANGEL: Well, we are.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.484
This is not a good idea.

43:14.517 --> 43:16.019
Neither was taking
Galindo's kid

43:16.053 --> 43:17.687
without giving us a heads up.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.422
You know as much
as you need to know.

43:19.456 --> 43:20.991
Bullshit.

43:21.024 --> 43:22.892
We're the ones that have
to deal with the backlash.

43:29.532 --> 43:33.103
My brother,
he knows Galindo's wife.

43:33.136 --> 43:35.205
They were together
before he went to prison.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.273
Is that going
to be a problem?

43:36.306 --> 43:37.740
No.

43:37.774 --> 43:39.542
But I'm giving you the facts.

43:39.576 --> 43:40.843
Putting everything
on the table.

43:40.877 --> 43:43.046
That's how this
is supposed to work.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.714
Is he still
in love with her?

43:46.549 --> 43:48.485
No more than I'm in love
with you, mi dulce.

43:50.753 --> 43:53.390
Let's not
complicate this, Angel.

43:53.423 --> 43:54.992
'Cause things are so simple.

43:56.293 --> 43:57.727
Is the baby okay?

43:57.760 --> 43:59.162
Of course he is.

43:59.196 --> 44:01.031
And what happens next?

44:01.064 --> 44:02.699
You secure the buyer
for the heroin.

44:02.732 --> 44:04.567
To the kid, Adelita.

44:05.568 --> 44:08.505
For now, he belongs to us.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.641
That's so fucked up.

44:13.176 --> 44:15.378
Galindo's upside down.

44:15.412 --> 44:16.546
He ain't gonna rest
till he's got a basket

44:16.579 --> 44:17.547
full of rebel heads.

44:17.580 --> 44:18.915
He'll never find us.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.283
(distant food truck
music playing)

44:20.317 --> 44:22.352
We are smoke.

44:22.385 --> 44:25.388
Just a name and a voice.

44:49.446 --> 44:50.913
Oh, Jesus.

45:04.461 --> 45:05.728
I don't think this
is the kind of smoke

45:05.762 --> 45:07.830
you were talking about.

45:50.707 --> 45:53.376
-Went to help our old man.

45:53.410 --> 45:54.644
I'll call him back.

45:54.677 --> 45:56.246
No, let him have the night.

45:56.279 --> 45:58.181
Felipe'll work him
harder than us anyhow.

45:58.215 --> 46:00.517
Yeah, you don't wanna
piss off the butcher.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.984
End up on a fucking meat hook.

46:03.886 --> 46:10.760
*

46:15.532 --> 46:16.599
Everything all right, carnal?

46:18.435 --> 46:21.304
Yeah, I just--Long day, jefe.

46:21.338 --> 46:23.240
Yeah.

46:23.273 --> 46:26.008
Time to relax.

46:26.042 --> 46:27.544
You earned it, huh?

46:27.577 --> 46:32.249
*

46:32.282 --> 46:34.083
Yeah, we did.

46:34.117 --> 46:36.419
*

46:36.453 --> 46:38.788
Shit, what happens when
Bishop finds out

46:38.821 --> 46:40.157
about the burning Bennies?

46:41.624 --> 46:43.926
Won't be tonight.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.062
Yeah, we need this.

46:46.095 --> 46:52.969
*

46:53.803 --> 46:55.738
Thanks, bro.

46:55.772 --> 47:01.043
*

47:03.280 --> 47:10.153
*

47:37.680 --> 47:38.881
GALINDO:

48:20.457 --> 48:23.025
Don't tighten it too much.
You'll bend the copper.

48:23.059 --> 48:24.294
I know.

48:26.796 --> 48:27.864
EZ: Who's that?

48:27.897 --> 48:30.400
You wanted to talk.

48:30.433 --> 48:31.868
With the feds?

48:31.901 --> 48:33.336
I thought you said
that was a bad idea.

48:33.370 --> 48:40.243
*

48:48.851 --> 48:49.919
Come on in.

48:50.987 --> 48:57.860
*

48:58.395 --> 48:59.729
EMILY: Thank you.

48:59.762 --> 49:01.998
*

49:02.031 --> 49:04.066
I'll pack your order.

49:04.100 --> 49:06.503
*

49:06.536 --> 49:10.006
I called Felipe.
He said you'd be coming by.

49:11.341 --> 49:13.009
Galindo knows you're here?

49:13.042 --> 49:15.211
EMILY: I told his mother
I'd pick up a roast.

49:16.679 --> 49:20.216
Of course, I travel
with a platoon now.

49:20.249 --> 49:27.089
*

49:27.123 --> 49:30.827
Are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

49:30.860 --> 49:33.530
-Think I'm still in shock.
-I'm sorry, I...

49:33.563 --> 49:34.931
*

49:34.964 --> 49:36.933
That's why I'm here.

49:36.966 --> 49:43.039
*

49:45.141 --> 49:47.209
Thank you.

49:47.243 --> 49:52.382
*

49:55.385 --> 49:57.754
I need your help, EZ.

49:58.955 --> 50:00.390
Okay.

50:00.423 --> 50:02.158
*

50:02.191 --> 50:03.626
I need to know the truth.

50:03.660 --> 50:07.063
*

50:07.096 --> 50:08.898
I need someone I can trust.

50:08.931 --> 50:11.434
*

50:11.468 --> 50:13.970
EMILY: My son.

50:14.003 --> 50:15.905
*

50:15.938 --> 50:18.708
I saw the video
from the rebels.

50:18.741 --> 50:21.778
Miguel promised there
would be no retaliation,

50:21.811 --> 50:23.012
but then...

50:24.146 --> 50:25.848
something happened.

50:25.882 --> 50:27.884
Something changed,
and now...

50:29.452 --> 50:31.087
EMILY: No one will even
look me in the eye.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.456
*

50:33.490 --> 50:36.258
I'm so sorry to put
this on you, EZ.

50:36.292 --> 50:37.460
I just...

50:37.494 --> 50:39.128
*

50:39.161 --> 50:41.063
Mmm...

50:41.097 --> 50:42.632
I don't know who else to ask.

50:42.665 --> 50:46.603
*

50:46.636 --> 50:49.406
If anything happens...

50:49.439 --> 50:52.241
will you tell me?

50:52.274 --> 50:53.676
Please?

50:53.710 --> 50:59.782
*

50:59.816 --> 51:01.384
It already has.

51:02.985 --> 51:04.654
EZ: Retaliation.

51:06.155 --> 51:07.924
Two innocents burned to death.

51:09.358 --> 51:10.860
Dumped in Merchant Square.

51:10.893 --> 51:12.629
*

51:14.196 --> 51:21.070
*

51:30.346 --> 51:32.114
-I'm sorry.
-No, I--

51:32.148 --> 51:35.217
-Thank you for telling me.
-I, uh...

51:35.251 --> 51:37.787
I should go.
I--I have to--

51:37.820 --> 51:39.155
EZ: Yeah, of course.

51:39.188 --> 51:46.028
*

51:46.062 --> 51:49.265
-Hey, the roast.
-Em.

51:49.298 --> 51:51.300
Oh, thank you.

51:51.333 --> 51:57.339
*

51:57.373 --> 51:59.642
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to this baby.

51:59.676 --> 52:01.210
*

52:01.243 --> 52:02.512
Your son.

52:02.545 --> 52:08.217
*

52:14.290 --> 52:21.197
*

52:40.016 --> 52:41.383
Yeah.

52:41.417 --> 52:43.853
("Jesus Gave Me Water"
playing)

52:45.354 --> 52:48.057
*

52:48.090 --> 52:54.931
* Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water *

52:54.964 --> 52:56.933
* Jesus gave me water

52:58.668 --> 53:00.537
* I wanna let
his praises swell *

53:00.570 --> 53:02.304
Come on, Papi.

53:02.338 --> 53:08.077
* Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water *

53:08.110 --> 53:10.146
How do you like this, baby?

53:10.179 --> 53:15.417
* Gave me lasting water
and it was not in the well *

53:15.451 --> 53:18.855
* There was a woman
from Samaria *

53:18.888 --> 53:20.489
Get in.

53:20.523 --> 53:22.759
* Came to the well
for water *

53:22.792 --> 53:29.632
* There she met a stranger
who did a story tell *

53:34.403 --> 53:36.305
You must be really desperate.

53:36.338 --> 53:38.140
*

53:38.174 --> 53:40.843
Shut the fuck up
and get in the car, Mom.

53:40.877 --> 53:42.111
We gotta talk.

53:42.144 --> 53:43.746
*

53:43.780 --> 53:47.016
* Yes he gave her water

53:47.049 --> 53:50.386
* Jesus gave her water

53:50.419 --> 53:53.956
* Loving, lasting water

53:53.990 --> 53:57.426
* And it was not in the well

54:04.567 --> 54:11.473
*
