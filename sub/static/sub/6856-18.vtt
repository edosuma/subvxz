00:16.600 --> 00:19.269
<i>Hard-pressed Jedi
and their valiant clone troopers</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:22.773
<i>Have thwarted an insidious
Separatist plot to plant bombs</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:26.568
<i>Loaded with the deadly blue
shadow virus in key Republic systems</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:29.029
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker</i>

00:29.196 --> 00:32.824
<i>Have captured the vile scientist
behind the nefarious scheme</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.743
<i>Dr Nuvo Vindi</i>

00:34.910 --> 00:39.331
<i>Now the Jedi prepare to transport Vindi
to the Republic capital for trial</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:40.916
That was close

00:41.041 --> 00:45.045
If that virus had escaped
everyone on Naboo would be dead now

00:45.170 --> 00:48.841
Oh, well Just another boring day
saving the universe

00:49.007 --> 00:51.802
All right, let's take this sleemo
back to Theed

00:51.969 --> 00:56.390
So we can help Padmé and Ahsoka
clean up down there

01:02.563 --> 01:06.024
Senator, you should see this
It's one of the virus bombs

01:06.149 --> 01:08.569
It looks like the chamber
that holds the virus is missing

01:08.735 --> 01:13.156
- That droid must have taken it
- Sound the alarm

01:14.199 --> 01:16.660
How could droids have gotten ahold
of the virus containers?

01:16.827 --> 01:21.248
I don't know, but I don't want
to be around when they set it off

01:24.209 --> 01:26.670
We've already taken
the virus containers out of these bombs

01:26.795 --> 01:28.797
We'll just have to check them again

01:28.964 --> 01:33.093
The virus is liberated

01:33.260 --> 01:36.346
You are doomed, young Jedi,

01:36.513 --> 01:40.767
along with the rest of the planet

01:40.934 --> 01:42.269
Hey, you

01:42.436 --> 01:45.564
Get away from there!

01:45.731 --> 01:49.776
What was that?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.154
Virus leak

01:52.321 --> 01:56.742
Get to the safe room
Come on!

02:08.169 --> 02:10.631
- There's the safe room
- No chance

02:10.797 --> 02:14.051
- Hurry The doors are closing
- Don't worry

02:14.218 --> 02:16.845
Get inside, Captain

02:16.970 --> 02:21.391
Hurry

02:23.810 --> 02:25.896
Ahsoka, what is going on down there?

02:26.063 --> 02:29.024
<i>The droids released the virus,
but we managed to seal the lab</i>

02:29.191 --> 02:30.142
And Padmé?

02:30.177 --> 02:32.233
<i>Haven't heard from her since the bomb</i>

02:32.736 --> 02:34.696
Anakin, can you hear me?

02:34.863 --> 02:35.841
Anakin?

02:35.876 --> 02:38.668
<i>Padmé, I'm here
Are you all right?</i>

02:38.703 --> 02:40.327
Yes, for the time being

02:40.494 --> 02:43.288
Jar Jar and I were in a safety chamber
when the alarm went off

02:43.455 --> 02:45.207
<i>We're wearing protective suits</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:48.961
The virus is loose, but Ahsoka
has sealed off the entire facility

02:49.127 --> 02:52.589
<i>Yes, but any remaining droids
will try to break out</i>

02:52.756 --> 02:56.343
I'll do what I can to stop them
I cannot let that virus escape

02:56.510 --> 03:00.889
Be careful

03:01.014 --> 03:04.226
Put this on

03:04.393 --> 03:07.145
Come on, Jar Jar
We're going to find Ahsoka

03:07.312 --> 03:11.733
We'll need her help
to find those droids

03:12.359 --> 03:15.320
Where's the antidote, Vindi?

03:15.487 --> 03:18.448
You mistake my role, Jedi

03:18.615 --> 03:22.369
My job was to manufacture a plague,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.913
not to cure it

03:25.080 --> 03:27.040
We don't have time for games

03:27.207 --> 03:30.711
Patience, Anakin There's more
than one way to skin a womp rat

03:30.878 --> 03:33.589
I said, "where?"

03:33.755 --> 03:37.509
Yes, kill me now
and spare these old bones

03:37.676 --> 03:40.721
the blue shadow's dire embrace,

03:40.888 --> 03:43.390
because once the first droid

03:43.557 --> 03:46.101
breaks out of that laboratory,

03:46.268 --> 03:50.647
all Naboo is doomed

03:50.814 --> 03:53.692
The fastest way
to save senator Amidala and Ahsoka

03:53.859 --> 03:58.280
is to get Vindi back to the capital
and find an actual antidote

04:05.162 --> 04:08.290
Oh, no, no, no
Some of the virus got in here

04:08.415 --> 04:10.334
We didn't close the door
fast enough

04:10.501 --> 04:13.795
We may be dead men,
but we could still stop those droids

04:13.921 --> 04:15.005
Don't worry

04:15.172 --> 04:17.591
My Master will find a cure
for this virus

04:17.757 --> 04:19.120
We're not dead yet

04:19.154 --> 04:21.973
<i>Is anyone out there?
can anyone hear...</i>

04:22.007 --> 04:23.180
Senator Amidala

04:23.347 --> 04:26.266
we're trapped in the safe room
at the end of complex "B"

04:26.433 --> 04:28.310
<i>We'll be right there</i>

04:28.477 --> 04:32.481
<i>Are you contaminated?</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:35.577
I'm afraid so

04:49.998 --> 04:52.835
Dr Vindi,
you'll pay for your treachery

04:53.001 --> 04:55.838
Take him away

04:56.004 --> 04:58.806
Now we'll need to find an antidote

04:58.841 --> 05:01.608
I think I found an answer for you

05:03.887 --> 05:05.722
So you think you found a cure?

05:05.889 --> 05:09.977
Possibly A little-known extract
made from reeksa root

05:10.143 --> 05:12.855
A weed-like vine found only on lego,

05:13.021 --> 05:14.857
The world of 1,000 moons,

05:15.023 --> 05:17.276
Deep in Separatist-controlled space

05:17.442 --> 05:19.361
Let's go

05:19.528 --> 05:22.656
- You must move cautiously if you...
- There's no time for caution

05:22.823 --> 05:26.618
My padawan is trapped on there,
and so is Padmé

05:26.743 --> 05:28.745
I mean, senator Amidala

05:28.912 --> 05:32.833
I applaud your courage,
General Skywalker, but it's suicide

05:33.000 --> 05:35.544
Once we contain the virus,
we can send troops

05:35.711 --> 05:38.297
No, Obi-Wan and I can handle it

05:38.463 --> 05:42.885
I concur, Anakin

05:45.888 --> 05:47.848
Padmé and Ahsoka will be fine

05:48.015 --> 05:52.436
They will be, if we succeed

05:56.565 --> 05:58.410
All the doors are locked

06:01.382 --> 06:03.242
Boy, that's a relief

06:08.118 --> 06:09.453
Senator Amidala

06:09.620 --> 06:10.840
<i>Where are you?</i>

06:10.875 --> 06:12.806
We're right outside your
safety room

06:12.998 --> 06:14.703
<i>Can you get the door open?</i>

06:15.086 --> 06:17.178
Go ahead, Jar Jar

06:24.927 --> 06:26.345
I'm sorry, Ahsoka

06:26.512 --> 06:30.057
Don't worry about us, senator
We still have a job to do

06:30.182 --> 06:31.934
There aren't very many droids left

06:32.100 --> 06:34.853
We saw some
heading toward the south entrance

06:35.020 --> 06:36.688
As long as we're able,

06:36.855 --> 06:40.776
we'll help you destroy those droids
before they breach the compound

06:40.943 --> 06:45.364
You take the north corridor,
and we'll take the south

06:49.449 --> 06:51.159
The droids are close

06:51.326 --> 06:55.747
I can hear them
cutting through the wall

07:10.554 --> 07:13.181
- Stop
- Don't open that hatch

07:13.306 --> 07:17.727
Too late

07:22.858 --> 07:24.818
There it is lego

07:24.985 --> 07:29.239
- What do you make of this?
- It looks like a graveyard

07:29.406 --> 07:33.827
of ships

07:51.761 --> 07:52.888
Let's go

07:53.054 --> 07:57.475
Anakin

08:02.439 --> 08:06.943
Not good

08:07.110 --> 08:08.904
Welcome to lego

08:09.070 --> 08:10.780
Roger, roger

08:10.947 --> 08:15.368
Anakin, wait Wait

08:26.421 --> 08:28.965
Welcome to lego

08:29.132 --> 08:30.300
Very impressive

08:30.467 --> 08:32.726
You just destroyed
17 defenseless battle droids

08:32.760 --> 08:34.905
Without suffering a scratch

08:34.971 --> 08:36.597
Welco

08:36.765 --> 08:38.975
18, actually

08:39.142 --> 08:40.936
The venerable Jaybo Hood

08:41.102 --> 08:42.687
requests an audience

08:42.854 --> 08:44.147
Jaybo?

08:44.314 --> 08:45.440
Hey

08:45.607 --> 08:47.901
You guys have any idea
how long it took me to repurpose

08:48.026 --> 08:50.028
those droids?

08:50.195 --> 08:52.906
- You're Jaybo?
- Well, do you?

08:53.073 --> 08:55.492
I apologize for my friend's
rather rash behavior

08:55.659 --> 09:00.080
Nine months, man
It took me nine months

09:06.044 --> 09:09.923
Oh, that's our cue

09:10.090 --> 09:14.511
Channel two

09:19.766 --> 09:23.687
How'd a kid like you
come by this many battle droids anyway?

09:23.854 --> 09:25.564
When the Separatists took off,

09:25.730 --> 09:28.149
they left all this junk behind
I got a whole warehouse

09:28.275 --> 09:32.487
- full of 'em right over there
- So you programmed them to serve you

09:32.654 --> 09:36.324
No reason
to let a good droid rust, right?

09:36.491 --> 09:38.243
Looks like you used a

09:38.410 --> 09:41.913
Macro protocol
to wipe them all simultaneously

09:42.038 --> 09:44.916
- Impressive
- I see you know your droids

09:45.083 --> 09:48.295
You're Jedi, aren't you?
You want me to show you how I did it?

09:48.461 --> 09:52.883
Perhaps another time
What we need now is reeksa root

09:53.508 --> 09:56.720
- Do you know where we can find some?
- Here, there,

09:56.887 --> 09:59.598
everywhere

09:59.764 --> 10:03.894
We don't have time for games, kid
Where's the root?

10:04.060 --> 10:07.272
What my friend is trying to say
is that we are in a bit of a hurry

10:07.439 --> 10:09.232
Not anymore you're not

10:09.399 --> 10:10.400
Look, you little

10:10.567 --> 10:12.819
This system is haunted, cursed,

10:12.986 --> 10:13.904
whatever

10:14.070 --> 10:18.491
Anyway, Jedi or not, no one gets off
this rock alive,

10:19.075 --> 10:20.535
not past Droll

10:20.702 --> 10:23.246
Droll

10:23.413 --> 10:24.706
Droll?

10:24.873 --> 10:27.542
Yeah, Droll,

10:27.709 --> 10:29.586
the phantom ruler of lego

10:29.753 --> 10:32.756
He destroys anything
that leaves the planet

10:32.881 --> 10:37.302
50 of the best star pilots
in the galaxy have tried

10:37.469 --> 10:40.222
50 tried

10:40.388 --> 10:42.224
50 died

10:42.390 --> 10:45.227
I suppose that explains
the ruined ships in the moonbelt

10:45.393 --> 10:49.814
First things first We'll have to deal
with this droll later

11:01.326 --> 11:05.831
<i>- This-a help
- Jar Jar, no</i>

11:08.834 --> 11:09.960
Senator

11:10.126 --> 11:14.506
<i>Senator,
your suit's been compromised</i>

11:14.673 --> 11:17.050
I'm so sorry

11:17.217 --> 11:18.343
Don't blame yourself

11:18.510 --> 11:22.889
These things tend to happen
in a war zone

11:28.812 --> 11:31.314
- Are you coming?
- You've got to be kidding

11:31.481 --> 11:33.817
No way I'm going down there

11:33.984 --> 11:37.112
- You trying to tell us something?
- Don't worry, it's simple

11:37.279 --> 11:40.156
Follow the vines to the bottom,
dig up the roots,

11:40.323 --> 11:42.200
But don't touch the vine

11:42.367 --> 11:44.786
Aside from the obvious, why not?

11:44.953 --> 11:47.289
Because the plants don't like it,

11:47.414 --> 11:49.666
And they have big, sharp teeth

11:49.833 --> 11:51.084
Teeth?

11:51.251 --> 11:53.378
This is getting better
by the minute

11:53.545 --> 11:56.590
And watch out for the flying Xandu

11:56.756 --> 11:58.300
What's a Xandu?

11:58.466 --> 12:02.888
I'm not sure

12:08.435 --> 12:12.939
Master, hop on

12:13.440 --> 12:17.152
This isn't going to work

12:17.319 --> 12:18.820
How are you doing up there?

12:18.987 --> 12:21.072
I'm almost through

12:21.239 --> 12:25.660
There they are

12:34.544 --> 12:37.506
I'm all right

12:37.672 --> 12:41.051
There, those are the roots
we're looking for

12:41.218 --> 12:45.639
Oh, poodoo

12:48.975 --> 12:53.480
I have a bad feeling about this

12:54.105 --> 12:56.316
Don't take too long with that

12:56.441 --> 13:00.737
I'll go as fast as I can

13:00.862 --> 13:04.324
Anakin, hurry

13:04.491 --> 13:07.369
- Anakin? Now
- Okay, okay

13:07.536 --> 13:10.956
Got it

13:11.122 --> 13:15.544
- Hold still
- We've got to get out of here now

13:36.648 --> 13:39.693
You made it
I knew you would

13:39.860 --> 13:41.790
Oh, did you?

13:45.265 --> 13:48.476
The place dried up
once the spice convoy stopped running

13:48.601 --> 13:49.435
Out here

13:49.602 --> 13:53.231
We're just one of the millions
of little backwaters no one cares about

13:53.398 --> 13:55.149
Those of us who are left

13:55.275 --> 13:57.026
can't leave because of the curse

13:57.193 --> 13:59.070
Cursed, we are

13:59.237 --> 14:02.991
The planet is cursed

14:03.157 --> 14:06.035
Cursed by whom, my twitchy friend?

14:06.202 --> 14:09.205
The ghost of Droll, that's who

14:09.372 --> 14:10.498
A ghost?

14:10.665 --> 14:13.293
The spirit of the 1,000 moons,

14:13.459 --> 14:17.839
Our protector and destroyer

14:18.006 --> 14:19.688
If you ask me
It sounds like a load of...

14:19.723 --> 14:20.947
Superstition?

14:20.982 --> 14:22.468
That's one word for it

14:22.635 --> 14:26.514
Superstition, you say

14:26.681 --> 14:28.641
Can't hold on much

14:28.808 --> 14:31.352
someone help me

14:31.519 --> 14:33.021
That was Takido

14:33.187 --> 14:35.398
He was a friend of mine

14:35.565 --> 14:38.026
Try to leave this planet

14:38.192 --> 14:42.614
And your fate will be the same

14:45.867 --> 14:50.330
They'll never make it past Droll

14:52.332 --> 14:54.751
The ghost of Droll
may be a local superstition,

14:54.876 --> 14:57.253
But something real
blew up those ships

14:57.420 --> 14:59.589
"Real" we can handle

14:59.756 --> 15:00.715
Too bad

15:00.840 --> 15:02.576
I really liked those guys

15:02.611 --> 15:04.312
<i>Thanks for your help, kid</i>

15:06.179 --> 15:07.967
We couldn't have done it without you

15:08.002 --> 15:10.178
<i>Have you run into Droll yet?</i>

15:10.213 --> 15:12.685
Not to worry, Jaybo

15:20.109 --> 15:22.362
What's the matter, R2?
Afraid of a ghost?

15:22.528 --> 15:24.614
Droll is just a superstition

15:24.781 --> 15:26.282
There's our ghost

15:26.449 --> 15:27.659
Lasers

15:27.825 --> 15:32.247
We've triggered an energy field

15:35.124 --> 15:39.629
Turn the ship around
We'll never make it through

15:44.592 --> 15:46.678
The Separatists installed
those lasers

15:46.844 --> 15:48.930
to prevent people
from leaving the planet

15:49.097 --> 15:53.518
They're coming back

15:58.982 --> 16:01.484
<i>Master, can you hear me?</i>

16:01.651 --> 16:06.072
R2, amplify the signal

16:07.031 --> 16:09.450
<i>destroyed all the battle droids</i>

16:09.617 --> 16:11.911
<i>Inside the compound, Master</i>

16:12.078 --> 16:15.290
<i>Naboo is safe
from further contamination</i>

16:15.456 --> 16:19.877
<i>I repeat Naboo is safe</i>

16:20.795 --> 16:25.300
<i>Promise me that no one
will ever open this bunker</i>

16:25.592 --> 16:27.343
<i>Good-bye, Anakin</i>

16:27.510 --> 16:31.931
I...

16:34.058 --> 16:36.895
We'll borrow a power converter from
Jaybo and reprogram it to feed our

16:37.061 --> 16:39.856
- Slow down, Anakin
- "Slow down"?

16:40.023 --> 16:42.233
You saw them, Master
They're dying

16:42.400 --> 16:46.487
A great leap forward often requires
first taking two steps back

16:46.654 --> 16:50.533
And sometimes all it requires
is the will to jump

16:50.658 --> 16:55.079
At least hear me out on this

16:55.413 --> 16:57.206
Citizens of lego,

16:57.332 --> 16:59.667
Droll is not a ghost

16:59.834 --> 17:02.921
Rather,
it is a Separatist security system

17:03.087 --> 17:04.547
Nonsense

17:04.672 --> 17:08.425
You were lucky to escape alive,
simple as that

17:08.593 --> 17:11.262
And who says
we didn't make our own luck?

17:11.429 --> 17:15.516
The ghost of Droll does, that's who

17:15.683 --> 17:19.561
Did anyone inhabit lego's moons
before the Separatists arrived?

17:19.729 --> 17:24.150
- The angels, of course
- Angels?

17:26.778 --> 17:28.445
We were a peaceful people

17:28.613 --> 17:31.199
Before the Separatists
drove us from our homes

17:31.366 --> 17:32.909
And stole our moon

17:33.076 --> 17:35.954
And which moon was that?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.665
Millius Prime

17:38.831 --> 17:43.253
The primary node,
it must be near Millius Prime

17:43.503 --> 17:45.546
Vulture droids Jaybo,

17:45.672 --> 17:47.632
can you reactivate
those vulture droids?

17:47.799 --> 17:50.551
Sure I can even fly them
by remote control

17:50.718 --> 17:51.511
Good

17:51.678 --> 17:55.682
We can have R2 fly the vulture droids
as a decoy into the laser field

17:55.848 --> 17:57.811
And since we know
what we're up against this time

17:57.846 --> 17:59.907
We can destroy the laser emitter

17:59.942 --> 18:04.190
And cut a path
right to Millius Prime

18:14.158 --> 18:16.077
What a waste

18:16.244 --> 18:18.955
With all due respect, Senator,

18:19.122 --> 18:21.291
It's what they're born to do

18:21.457 --> 18:25.753
I hope that their sacrifice
brings us closer to peace

18:25.920 --> 18:28.840
It will, Padmé

18:29.007 --> 18:33.428
- You must believe that
- Ahsoka

18:37.223 --> 18:38.766
Ready, General Kenobi

18:38.933 --> 18:43.354
Jaybo, activate the droids

18:48.484 --> 18:52.989
Transfer control
of the vulture droids to R2

19:10.423 --> 19:13.885
R2, intercept the lasers

19:14.052 --> 19:18.473
Send the vulture droids
directly into the laser generator

19:39.953 --> 19:42.038
You guys okay?

19:42.205 --> 19:43.665
Guys?

19:43.790 --> 19:45.458
We're fine, kid

19:45.625 --> 19:48.753
I'm afraid you'll need some new droids
to boss around, Jaybo

19:48.878 --> 19:53.299
The ones you lent us
are pretty much toast

19:53.466 --> 19:54.884
But the good news is

19:55.051 --> 19:59.472
that you're now free to leave lego
whenever you choose

20:03.017 --> 20:07.522
R2, set a course for Naboo

20:20.326 --> 20:24.747
I spoke with the medical droid
He expects you to make a full recovery

20:24.872 --> 20:27.041
I never lost faith in you

20:27.166 --> 20:28.334
None of us did

20:28.501 --> 20:29.627
That's good to hear,

20:29.794 --> 20:33.298
'cause there were a few moments
where we weren't so sure of ourselves

20:33.464 --> 20:37.885
Well, you did make it

20:40.513 --> 20:41.764
By the way,

20:41.931 --> 20:45.852
your padawan, was brilliant

20:46.019 --> 20:48.021
I trust I'll see you soon,

20:48.146 --> 20:50.815
General Skywalker?

20:50.982 --> 20:55.403
Of course, my lady

21:00.074 --> 21:04.454
I heard you were quite brave
fending off the battle droids, Jar Jar

21:04.621 --> 21:05.538
Really?

21:05.705 --> 21:08.291
Senator Amidala suggested
we offer you training

21:08.458 --> 21:10.668
To help hone your skills
with a blaster

21:10.835 --> 21:12.587
Really?

21:12.754 --> 21:13.588
Really

21:13.755 --> 21:16.925
Oh, boy
I'm a-gonna be trained

21:17.091 --> 21:21.512
I am not training him

21:22.096 --> 21:24.766
You did a fantastic job today,
Snips

21:24.933 --> 21:27.393
All thanks to your training, Master

21:27.560 --> 21:29.020
Yeah, you're right

21:29.187 --> 21:33.316
I probably do deserve
most of the credit

21:33.483 --> 21:35.318
But not all of it

21:35.485 --> 21:36.653
Good thing

21:36.819 --> 21:41.157
I know you don't mean
everything you say

21:41.324 --> 21:43.451
Pilot, get these two out of here

21:43.618 --> 21:48.039
Thank you, Master
