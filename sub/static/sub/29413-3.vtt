WEBVTT

00:10.749 --> 00:11.924
Hey, guys.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.143
Oh, hey.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.667
Wow, those plants
are beautiful.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.582
Thanks. I used to work
at a nursery

00:17.626 --> 00:18.844
back in Hickory Corners.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.238
Till I found out
what they were really growing.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.937
We just thought it'd be nice
to have a little pop of color.

00:24.981 --> 00:28.637
Yeah, we did that to this
neighborhood 30 years ago.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.988
Well, how about you, Dave,
you like to garden, too?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.643
I'm more
of a lawn man, myself.Hmm.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.428
Nothing I like better
than breaking out the old mower

00:37.472 --> 00:39.561
and showing the grass
who's boss.

00:39.604 --> 00:43.130
I would've bet on the grass.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.392
All right, all done.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.567
What do you think?

00:45.610 --> 00:47.221
I think it looks great.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.700
Calvin,

00:48.744 --> 00:51.051
I think we need
to fix our house up, too.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.574
What are you
talking about?

00:52.617 --> 00:55.620
We just got a new satellite dish
last year.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.840
We could start
with a new porch light.No.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.755
Then you're probably gonna want
a new door.No.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.627
And at that point, we're gonna
need all new landscaping, right?No.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.586
Ooh, that's gonna look great,
don't you think, Calvin?Yeah.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.023
No!

01:07.067 --> 01:09.069
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:09.112 --> 01:10.287
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.686
Ooh, what about this color
for the trim?

01:17.729 --> 01:20.123
Yeah, I like it.
"Fenwick Fog."

01:20.167 --> 01:21.690
Yeah, probably
'cause it sounds like something

01:21.733 --> 01:22.995
from Harry Potter.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.607
I wear that with
a badge of honor.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.696
Just like I wear
my Sorting Hat.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.525
What are you all doing?

01:30.568 --> 01:32.701
Picking out paint colors
for the house.

01:32.744 --> 01:36.008
Oh. Well, too bad there's
about to be a power outage.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.971
Dad, it's-it's a laptop.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.538
It has a battery.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.411
So does your car. Go home.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.152
Come on, Calvin.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.763
Happy wife, happy life.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.635
I want you to
paint the house.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.810
Fine.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.768
Malcolm, paint the house.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.511
Come on, Calvin,
be a good husband

02:00.555 --> 02:03.775
for your beautiful wife
and paint the house.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.168
All right.

02:05.212 --> 02:08.128
If it's that important to you
and you really want me

02:08.171 --> 02:09.694
to paint the house...Mm-hmm.

02:09.738 --> 02:10.608
...go ahead and hire someone.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.394
Just make sure
they're the best.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.569
The best?

02:14.612 --> 02:16.048
And the cheapest.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.615
Ah, there it is.That makes more sense.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.230
Hey, sweetie.
What are you doing?

02:23.273 --> 02:25.232
Getting a snack.If you look in the pantry,

02:25.275 --> 02:27.234
there's some
unsalted veggie chips.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.278
Okay,

02:28.322 --> 02:30.280
I won't look in the pantry.

02:36.721 --> 02:37.940
Hey, girl.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.724
I love it
when you call me that.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.249
Well, you want to give it a try?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.034
I'd love to...

02:45.077 --> 02:46.992
girl...

02:48.124 --> 02:49.647
No.No.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.040
No.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.085
What's up?Well, I was wondering

02:53.129 --> 02:55.740
if you had the number to that
guy who painted your house

02:55.784 --> 02:57.307
before you moved in.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.007
You guys are painting
your house?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.533
Dave loves painting houses.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.752
More like houses love
getting painted by Dave.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.798
You know,
I put myself

03:09.841 --> 03:11.756
through college painting them
back in Michigan.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.759
Oh. On our first date,
he took me on a tour

03:14.803 --> 03:16.457
of some of his
favorites.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.764
He even stopped and
touched up a couple.

03:19.808 --> 03:22.158
Aw. Well, on our first date

03:22.202 --> 03:24.987
Calvin broke up
with his girlfriend.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.208
You know,
if you want your house painted,

03:28.251 --> 03:29.557
I'd be happy to do it.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.949
I mean, friends
help out friends, right?

03:30.993 --> 03:32.429
And I can take today off.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.735
Well, that's so sweet of you,

03:33.778 --> 03:35.780
but Calvin wants me to hire
a professional.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.870
A... a professional?

03:40.916 --> 03:43.266
Do you think they
just let anyone paint

03:43.310 --> 03:45.225
the Kalamazoo Hall of Records?

03:46.313 --> 03:47.270
I don't know.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.403
I don't know white people stuff.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.884
You should let
him do it, Tina.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.451
He's really good.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.236
Look, I'm sure you're right,
but, you know, it's just that...

03:56.279 --> 03:58.238
I'll do it for free.Okay, you're hired.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.066
But you better do a good job.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.677
Oh, you got it, girl.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.245
See? Wow, he said it right.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.681
Ah. Thank you.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.900
I know some black people stuff.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.956
Dave?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.567
Wazzup!

04:23.611 --> 04:24.873
Ah.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.310
Should we tell him that's
not a thing anymore?

04:27.354 --> 04:28.311
It's not?

04:29.486 --> 04:31.749
Uh, Dave, what are
you doing up there?

04:31.793 --> 04:32.750
Oh, I'm painting your house.

04:32.794 --> 04:33.751
Mom hired you?

04:33.795 --> 04:35.231
No, no, no. She didn't hire me.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.928
I volunteered to do it for free.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.235
Dad is gonna hate this.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.498
It's a total violation
of his man code.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.935
Oh, yeah, he is
gonna freak out.
Yeah.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.197
You want to hang
around and watch?

04:45.241 --> 04:46.590
Wazzup!

04:48.157 --> 04:49.506
So, how we lookin'?

04:49.550 --> 04:51.160
Yo, that looks great, man.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.901
I can't wait
for your dad to see.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.598
He is gonna go nuts.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.992
Oh, you have no idea.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.907
All right.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.778
We're all finished patching
and sanding.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.214
Now it's time to prime.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.347
Can you feel the excitement
in the air?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.309
We should probably
warn him, right?

05:09.352 --> 05:11.093
Yeah, we probably should.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.052
Notice you're not moving.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.533
I noticed that, too.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.797
Well, all right!

05:21.408 --> 05:23.497
Yeah, that looks good,
doesn't it, Pop?

05:23.540 --> 05:24.933
Are you kidding me?

05:24.976 --> 05:26.456
This looks better than good.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.415
This guy knows what he's doing.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.853
I'm not sure he does.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.245
What?!

05:33.289 --> 05:35.160
Look at his work!Mm-hmm.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.337
This guy's a real pro.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.991
You see what happens
when your mother listens to me?

05:41.515 --> 05:42.951
Oh, hey, Calvin.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.040
Hold on.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.694
You'repainting the house?

05:46.737 --> 05:48.913
Wazzup!

05:48.957 --> 05:52.047
And, like you said,
he's doing a great job.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.223
You said that, Calvin?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.357
And the best part is,

05:57.400 --> 05:58.967
he's doing it for free.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.058
I-I need to, uh...Yeah.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.059
I-I'm gonna have to...

06:04.102 --> 06:05.930
Right.
Tina!

06:05.974 --> 06:07.454
Will you tell her

06:07.497 --> 06:09.412
that I'm gonna finish
the front today

06:09.456 --> 06:11.283
and I'll do the sides
tomorrow?

06:11.327 --> 06:12.763
Oh, isn't that sweet.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.635
He thinks there's
gonna be a tomorrow.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.290
Tina?

06:20.031 --> 06:21.250
Tina?

06:21.293 --> 06:22.860
What?
Tina,

06:22.904 --> 06:25.428
you're letting Dave paint
our house for free?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.256
So? You like anything free.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.433
No, I don't.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.087
You have two drawers
in the kitchen

06:32.130 --> 06:33.654
stuffed with ketchup packets.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.090
Those aren't free.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.353
They're built into the
price of the hamburger.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.835
Calvin, you're being ridiculous.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.793
See, you just
don't get it.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.056
Letting another man work
on your house for free,

06:45.100 --> 06:48.059
it's like saying you
can't do it yourself.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.321
Okay, so you want
to do it yourself?

06:49.365 --> 06:50.453
Hell no!

06:51.933 --> 06:54.109
But letting Dave
paint our house,

06:54.152 --> 06:56.459
that's a direct violation
of the man code.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.723
Oh, please. The last time
you talked about your man code,

06:59.767 --> 07:02.726
you refused to get stitches
and almost lost your finger.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.511
I did not.
It naturally healed.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.469
Look, I can
almost bend it.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.606
You know, I don't want to hear
any more of this nonsense.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.911
It's not nonsense.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.611
See, there are unwritten
rules to manhood.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.395
Like always give
a firm handshake.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.962
And that your word
is your bond.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.921
And never, evercompliment
another man's outfit

07:23.965 --> 07:26.446
unless you're
looking for a fight.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.232
Calvin, you told me to hire
someone good and cheap,

07:30.275 --> 07:32.582
which I did, so as far
as I'm concerned,

07:32.626 --> 07:34.410
the only problem
we have is you.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.543
You hire another man

07:36.586 --> 07:39.937
who's doing an excellent job
painting our house for free,

07:39.981 --> 07:42.026
and I'mthe problem?

07:43.245 --> 07:45.029
Okay, Tina.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.598
Well, okay, Calvin.

07:50.382 --> 07:54.082
If you don't like it,
then you do something about it.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.344
Oh, I will.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.259
And don't be messin'
with my ketchup packets.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.130
I know how many there are!

08:01.219 --> 08:02.873
Now, you're
probably wondering

08:02.917 --> 08:05.223
why I chose natural
over synthetic fiber.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.662
Yeah, that's exactly why
we're sticking around.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.621
Dave.

08:11.665 --> 08:12.840
You're fired.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.058
What? Why?

08:14.102 --> 08:16.713
Because I can paint
my own damn house.

08:16.757 --> 08:19.281
You can't fire me.
I'm doing this for free.

08:19.324 --> 08:22.153
And you call yourself a friend!

08:32.424 --> 08:34.470
Hey, Mr. Calvin.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.472
Oh, hey, little man.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.953
That's not how my dad
paints the house.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.520
Goodbye, little man.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.654
Have you ever done this before?

08:44.698 --> 08:46.264
No. But it's not that hard.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.570
I mean, you...

08:47.614 --> 08:49.137
dip it...

08:49.180 --> 08:52.183
slap it, watch it dry.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.316
Dip it, slap it...

08:56.361 --> 08:58.363
...watch it dry.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.498
Why won't you
just let my dad help you?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.067
Well, because of something
called the man code.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.591
That's a set
of unwritten rules

09:08.635 --> 09:12.508
that fathers have passed down
from generation to generation.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.205
What are the rules?

09:14.249 --> 09:16.164
Well, for one...

09:16.207 --> 09:19.602
never text a man
"Get home safe."

09:19.646 --> 09:23.650
If he doesn't,
it's just God's plan.

09:23.693 --> 09:27.044
My friends and I mostly
text each other emojis.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.568
Oh, oh, you got
to stop doing that.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.659
The only emojis you can text
to another man is

09:32.702 --> 09:33.834
the fist bump,

09:33.877 --> 09:35.270
strong arm,

09:35.313 --> 09:37.054
and the thumbs up.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.188
What about a unicorn head?

09:40.231 --> 09:44.627
Only if the fist bump
is punching it in the face.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.411
'Kay.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.849
Oh, oh, oh.
And that's another one.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.634
Never text
another man, "'Kay."

09:52.504 --> 09:54.637
It's always, "O-kay."

09:54.681 --> 09:56.030
Wh-Why?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.510
No one knows.
It-it just is.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.036
O-kay.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.690
There you go.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.173
Yeah, he got that
way faster than Marty.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.571
What are you doing?

10:15.615 --> 10:19.096
Watching Calvin
paint his house.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.489
It's a disaster.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.317
He didn't prime,
he didn't tape.

10:22.360 --> 10:26.147
It's... it's just like he's
dipping and slapping out there.

10:28.932 --> 10:32.153
You know, seeing you out
there painting yesterday

10:32.196 --> 10:34.503
brought back a lot
of fond memories.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.202
Oh, yeah?Mm-hmm.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.944
Like what?

10:40.988 --> 10:42.903
Mm, like when they
gave you the keys

10:42.946 --> 10:44.600
to the Hall of Records,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.907
and we had some fun
in the permit office.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.997
Ooh, we definitelydidn't
have a permit for that.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.088
So, I was thinking,
maybe later today...

10:54.131 --> 10:56.394
Oh, for God's sakes.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.137
He's stirring the paint
with a tree branch!

11:00.181 --> 11:02.705
This man is a maniac!

11:02.749 --> 11:05.708
I don't understand why he
insists on doing this alone.

11:05.752 --> 11:09.494
Easy, Dad. Man code.What?

11:09.538 --> 11:12.019
He said you're breaking
the rules of being a man.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.240
By the way, you got
to stop texting me unicorns.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.245
What is he talking about?

11:21.289 --> 11:23.770
I was not breaking man code.
I was following it.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.207
Always have your buddy's back,
never leave a job unfinished.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.383
And if your friend
looks good in a new suit,

11:28.426 --> 11:29.863
make sure to let him know.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.387
Well, instead
of standing here

11:32.430 --> 11:34.650
watching Calvin paint,

11:34.694 --> 11:38.306
maybe we could go
upstairs and...

11:38.349 --> 11:39.655
Ooh...Ugh.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.265
Would you look at that?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.832
Oh, my gosh.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.182
He's using rollers
on the window frames.Mm.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.358
The man's oblivious
to everything!

11:52.320 --> 11:54.322
Yo, I hear
this movie is hilarious.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.367
I don't know, man.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.456
I doubt anything's gonna top
watching Dad splash around

11:58.500 --> 12:00.415
in a paint can
looking for his phone.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.376
Uh, Marty, what are you doing?

12:05.420 --> 12:06.726
I'm sitting down.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.379
Uh, man code, Marty!

12:08.423 --> 12:09.903
Whenever possible,

12:09.946 --> 12:12.122
two men always leave
a seat in between them.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
What? But if I sit

12:13.950 --> 12:15.996
over there, how are we
gonna share the popcorn?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.957
We're not.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.395
And if we go
to the bathroom together,

12:24.439 --> 12:27.224
eyes forward,
no talking at the urinal.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.226
Okay, dude. Okay.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.968
I just thought with all
your talk about being "woke,"

12:32.012 --> 12:33.796
you'd be a little
more progressive.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.233
Um, excuse you?
I am progressive.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.931
Really?Yeah.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.584
Because it seems to me
you've bought into Dad's

12:39.628 --> 12:40.934
outdated ideas
about masculinity.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.197
Oh, no, I have not.Prove it.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.416
Okay, I will.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.247
There. See?

12:50.291 --> 12:52.554
Woke.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.208
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.818
That feels okay,
doesn't it?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
You know, actually,
it's not that bad.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.256
Exactly.Yeah.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.562
You're still a man.Right.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.998
I'm still a man.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.695
Right.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.394
Some people might even say
that we are more manly

13:06.437 --> 13:09.136
because we're so comfortable
with ourselves.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.528
Yeah. Good for us.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.052
Yeah, man.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.705
Pop doesn't know
what he's talking about.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.882
Man, no.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.109
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna move over there.Yeah.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.719
This seat is
way more comfortable.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.765
I feel like here.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.465
Well, I think
I got most of the paint off.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.208
But just in case...

13:38.252 --> 13:41.385
maybe you should check
to see if I missed some spots.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.085
Oh, you missed a few
spots, all right.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.957
Under the window, next
to the air conditioner,

13:48.001 --> 13:50.264
the entire back
of the house.

13:50.307 --> 13:53.006
Oh, now you want the back
of the house painted?

13:53.049 --> 13:54.659
Someone's getting
a little bougie.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.401
Calvin, this is our home.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.794
I just want it
to look nice.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.492
I know, and it will,
babe, I promise.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.625
Mm. You did look
manly out there.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.583
I did, didn't I?Mm-hmm.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.325
I mean, check out
this property, girl.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.023
Would you love it
or list it?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.418
What was that?

14:14.462 --> 14:16.507
Oh, you know what that was.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.077
No, no, no. What
was that sound?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.645
Ooh, I think somebody's
trying to break in.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.127
Well, he ain't
the only one. Come on.Calvin!

14:27.170 --> 14:28.389
Fine.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.260
All right.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.132
I'll go check it out,

14:32.175 --> 14:35.439
but if I'm not back here
in two minutes, call the police.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.701
Okay.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.529
Uh, but use your white voice.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.064
Dave, what the hell
are you doing?!

14:53.501 --> 14:55.416
I'm finishing
the job I started.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.766
That's man code!

14:57.809 --> 14:59.333
Nice pajamas, by the way.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.250
Get down from there
and stop painting my house.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.512
Why?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.470
Because
you're making me look bad.

15:06.514 --> 15:09.125
All I'm doing is making
your house look better.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.085
Exactly. And I'll never
forgive you for it.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.871
Calvin, what's going on?
You need backup?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.004
I got my beat-down pan.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.483
Go back inside.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.007
Uh, it's just Dave.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.140
What is going on out here?

15:24.184 --> 15:26.838
And why does Tina have
her beat-down pan?

15:28.405 --> 15:31.452
Calvin, just let me do this
for you.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.758
Oh, you want
to do something for me?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.630
Then I'll do something for you!

15:35.673 --> 15:37.632
What is he doing?

15:37.675 --> 15:39.808
I don't know,
but it's gonna be stupid.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.071
Oh.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.986
Check it out, Dave.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.466
I'm about to cut
your grass for you!

15:45.509 --> 15:47.424
What?!

15:48.860 --> 15:50.601
Calvin, don't you
start that lawn mower!

15:50.645 --> 15:52.386
Oh, I'll do it, Dave.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.083
I'll do it.Calvin, don't!

15:54.127 --> 15:56.216
Dave, too late.
You brought this on yourself.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.047
Like I said,
you brought this on yourself!

16:02.483 --> 16:04.789
Dad? What are you doing, man?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.269
I'm cutting Dave's lawn

16:06.313 --> 16:07.618
to punish him
for painting my house.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.579
Calvin, if you start
that lawn mower, I'm gonna

16:11.622 --> 16:13.755
come out here tomorrow night,
I'm gonna put on a second coat!

16:16.453 --> 16:18.281
Huh?

16:18.325 --> 16:20.153
Huh?

16:20.196 --> 16:21.458
Uh, should
we stop them?

16:21.502 --> 16:23.069
Are you kidding me?

16:23.112 --> 16:26.072
If we stay quiet, one of them
might wash my car.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.551
How you like that, Dave?

16:27.595 --> 16:29.336
This is what you get
for breaking the man code--

16:29.379 --> 16:30.554
freshly-cut grass!

16:30.598 --> 16:32.513
You broke the
man code!

16:32.556 --> 16:33.775
CALVIN:
You broke it!No, you broke it!

16:33.818 --> 16:35.603
You broke it, Dave.
You broke-broke it.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.395
I did break that.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.322
Morning.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.368
Hey.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.982
Hey, look, uh,
about last night, man...

17:07.026 --> 17:09.898
Yeah, yeah. Uh, things got
a little out of hand.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.900
In hindsight, maybe
I shouldn't have been out

17:11.943 --> 17:14.076
in the middle of the night
painting your house.

17:16.731 --> 17:19.690
Yeah, in retrospect,
that did start this whole thing.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.824
Look, I really didn't
mean to start a fight.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.608
I know.

17:24.652 --> 17:28.221
But, Dave, you just
can't do another man a favor

17:28.264 --> 17:29.918
without asking him first.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.398
Why not?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.400
Because then,
I would owe you one,

17:33.443 --> 17:35.228
and I don't like
owing anybody anything.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.056
Well, I bought you
a bagel last week.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.190
But I drove, so we were even.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.499
Calvin, you don't
owe me anything.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.153
We're friends.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.851
Well, maybe that's how
it works back in Kalamazoo,

17:49.894 --> 17:51.853
but out here, it's different.

17:53.985 --> 17:57.380
I-I guess we just have
different man codes.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.383
Yeah. I guess we do.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.125
You think there's
any overlap?

18:03.169 --> 18:05.823
Probably. I'm sure there is.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.699
What does yours say about
holding your wife's purse?

18:11.742 --> 18:15.659
Oh. Well, you can do it
as long as you look mad.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.357
Mm.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.054
That's what mine says, too.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.534
This is the face I make.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.236
Not bad. This is mine.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.458
That's the face you
made when I asked you

18:31.501 --> 18:32.807
to come to a spin class with me.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.593
Yeah, it's kind of like
a go-to scowl for me.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.989
Look, uh, I'll grab a broom
and help you clean up.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.339
Sure that doesn't violate
your man code?

18:43.383 --> 18:46.429
Good point.
You're on your own.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.350
All right, how am I looking
over here, man?

18:54.394 --> 18:56.309
Calvin, you're
a natural, but

18:56.352 --> 18:58.224
can I give you
one piece of advice?

18:58.267 --> 19:00.226
Sure.Okay, now,

19:00.269 --> 19:03.751
you're letting your
shoulder do all the work.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.362
The magic is
in your hips.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.370
So like this?There you go.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.027
See? Told you
it was sexy.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.335
You weren't kidding.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.120
I had Dave paint our house
five times in Michigan.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.774
It's how
we got Grover.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.473
Paint that wall, baby!

19:30.517 --> 19:33.084
Uh, yeah, Dave. You missed
some spots on the bottom.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.564
Take it down low.

19:34.608 --> 19:37.611
Yeah, drop that thang, Calvin.Mm-hmm.

19:37.654 --> 19:40.918
Calvin, uh, what's your
man code say about this?

19:40.962 --> 19:43.921
It's the number one rule
of the man code, Dave--

19:43.965 --> 19:45.706
always keep your wife happy.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.316
Drop that thing, dawg.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.060
Yeah, baby!Oh, yeah, baby!

19:52.103 --> 19:54.497
Yes! Oh! Oh!

19:54.541 --> 19:56.369
Oh, oh, oh.Oh, that's it, guy.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.240
That's it, babe.Yeah.
