00:01.601 --> 00:02.703
BERLUTI:
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.735 --> 00:04.370
We've decided to let you go.
Go where?

00:04.404 --> 00:05.739
YOUNG: Here's a check

00:05.772 --> 00:07.473
representing two weeks'
severance pay.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.443
I've generated fees
in excess of $6 million.

00:10.476 --> 00:12.579
You've handed me a check
for $15,000.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.180
YOUNG: Alan Shore seemed to know
this was coming.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.149
Did you tell him?
Yes.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.551
YOUNG: Your employment here
is terminated.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.754
What's with the red tie,
soldier?

00:20.787 --> 00:22.222
Red is soft.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.558
Soft does not work
around here, sailor.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.359
That's Denny Crane?

00:26.392 --> 00:27.160
The Denny Crane?

00:27.193 --> 00:28.128
BILLINGS: Don't be fooled.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.229
Once he's in the courtroom,

00:29.262 --> 00:30.697
he's every bit the icon.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.131
I'm a senior partner in my firm

00:32.165 --> 00:33.634
the way you are in yours.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.069
It's not enough
to insist on fidelity

00:36.402 --> 00:37.203
or fair dealing.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.706
A good leader
has to practice it.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.174
FOREPERSON:
"Was the defendant's termination

00:41.207 --> 00:42.308
of the plaintiff wrongful?",

00:42.342 --> 00:43.476
we find in the affirmative.

00:43.510 --> 00:44.811
We order the defendant to pay

00:44.845 --> 00:47.213
the plaintiff $2.3 million.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.616
SHORE: Denny,
this is Tara Wilson.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.352
We hire only the prettiest
people in this firm.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.354
Are you a pretty girl,
soldier?

00:54.387 --> 00:55.856
I am (clears throat) sir.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.023
I like her.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.268
(door opens)

01:02.302 --> 01:03.269
Jimmy.

01:03.303 --> 01:05.238
BERLUTI: Manny, what...

01:05.271 --> 01:06.239
QUINN: Look at you
in that suit.

01:06.272 --> 01:07.173
Do you, like, own that?

01:07.207 --> 01:09.042
(both laughs)

01:09.075 --> 01:10.911
BERLUTI: I was just talking
to your mother.

01:10.944 --> 01:11.945
QUINN: I know this.

01:11.978 --> 01:13.580
She told me, which is kind of
what put the idea

01:13.614 --> 01:14.848
in my brain
that I should, uh,

01:14.881 --> 01:16.082
maybe come see you.

01:16.116 --> 01:18.051
I heard you got fatter,
but you look good.

01:18.084 --> 01:19.720
Well, thanks, um,

01:19.753 --> 01:21.655
Ellenor Frutt,
Eugene Young,

01:21.688 --> 01:23.824
Manny Quinn,
old friend.

01:23.857 --> 01:25.125
FRUTT: Hi.

01:25.158 --> 01:26.459
BERLUTI: What's up?

01:26.492 --> 01:28.895
Uh, can I talk
in front of them?

01:28.929 --> 01:31.064
Well, uh, yes,
they're lawyers.

01:31.097 --> 01:34.367
Privilege applies
to all of us.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.937
I've had some drug problems
as of late,

01:36.970 --> 01:37.971
not using,

01:38.004 --> 01:39.673
I swear, just selling.

01:39.706 --> 01:40.574
I would never use.

01:40.607 --> 01:42.242
Anyway, I got, uh,

01:42.275 --> 01:44.210
I can talk, right?

01:44.244 --> 01:45.579
Yeah.

01:45.612 --> 01:47.313
I got myself
in this situation, okay?

01:47.347 --> 01:48.982
A few weeks ago, I got shot

01:49.015 --> 01:50.083
right in the ass,

01:50.116 --> 01:51.051
nothing serious.

01:51.084 --> 01:52.719
You know me,
I'm not a complainer.

01:52.753 --> 01:54.755
Anyway, I had this
dope deal coming up

01:54.788 --> 01:56.489
that I was planning.

01:56.523 --> 01:57.423
I didn't tell anybody

01:57.457 --> 01:59.059
except Gigi Coley,

01:59.092 --> 02:01.067
my girlfriend, remember Gigi?

02:01.101 --> 02:02.035
Of course.

02:02.068 --> 02:02.903
How is she?

02:02.936 --> 02:04.838
She got fatter, but she's good.

02:04.871 --> 02:06.873
Anyway, all of a sudden,

02:06.907 --> 02:08.675
the Feds are busting down
my door.

02:08.709 --> 02:09.976
I got raided.

02:10.009 --> 02:10.711
They seized my pot.

02:10.744 --> 02:11.912
They arrested me.

02:11.945 --> 02:14.014
They opened the wound
in my ass all over again.

02:14.047 --> 02:15.348
It was terrible.

02:15.381 --> 02:16.382
It healed up good,

02:16.416 --> 02:18.384
and I'm not suing for that
or nothing.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.587
But my point,

02:20.621 --> 02:21.988
nobody could have known

02:22.022 --> 02:23.389
about this drug deal, Jimmy.

02:23.423 --> 02:25.458
I didn't tell no one.

02:25.491 --> 02:27.528
I think the FBI bugged me.

02:27.561 --> 02:28.595
I'm positive.

02:28.629 --> 02:31.297
Bugged you? How?

02:31.331 --> 02:33.767
They inserted some device
in my buttocks.

02:34.701 --> 02:36.670
I know it sounds nuts,

02:36.703 --> 02:38.271
but I think during
the first surgery,

02:38.304 --> 02:40.406
they inserted one
of those small microchips,

02:40.440 --> 02:42.375
then during
the second procedure,

02:42.408 --> 02:43.877
they took it out.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.912
It's the only way they could
have known about the pot.

02:45.946 --> 02:46.947
I mean, I didn't talk
about this deal

02:46.980 --> 02:48.281
on the phone or nothing,

02:48.314 --> 02:50.483
so I want to bring a motion
to suppress.

02:50.517 --> 02:52.853
I mean, this is beyond
unconstitutional.

02:52.886 --> 02:55.121
You can't bug a man's ass.

02:55.155 --> 02:57.123
It isn't right.

02:58.825 --> 03:01.768
(music playing)

03:38.104 --> 03:39.540
You must be joking.

03:39.573 --> 03:41.675
I don't joke.
I don't believe in humor.

03:41.708 --> 03:42.843
Well, I don't believe in guns,

03:42.876 --> 03:45.278
and I do not shoot ducks.

03:45.311 --> 03:46.947
Every new employee
picks up a rifle.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.615
It's how I judge character.

03:48.649 --> 03:52.553
MODRY: Denny...

03:52.586 --> 03:53.453
a little problem,

03:53.486 --> 03:55.355
the Finnertys are here,
very upset.

03:55.388 --> 03:56.256
Oh?

03:56.289 --> 03:57.691
Who are they
and why do I care?

03:57.724 --> 03:59.125
They're the wrongful-death case

03:59.159 --> 04:00.100
you brought in here.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.635
And they're upset

04:01.668 --> 04:02.769
because their trial
starts tomorrow,

04:02.803 --> 04:04.037
and you've been
totally absent.

04:04.070 --> 04:05.171
Did you explain to them

04:05.205 --> 04:06.472
that I'm typically absent?

04:06.507 --> 04:07.974
MODRY: I did,
and they're maintaining

04:08.008 --> 04:09.309
it's you they hired,

04:09.342 --> 04:11.011
and they're feeling defrauded.

04:11.044 --> 04:12.579
All right.

04:12.613 --> 04:13.680
Tell them I'll be right in.

04:13.714 --> 04:14.581
MODRY: Okay.

04:14.615 --> 04:16.783
And to prepare me,

04:16.817 --> 04:18.384
do you know
what you plan to say?

04:18.418 --> 04:19.485
No idea.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.322
ROSE: Most paralegals
request not to work with me.

04:22.355 --> 04:24.057
Just so you know,
I am totally fine

04:24.090 --> 04:26.092
with being hated.
Got it.

04:26.126 --> 04:27.661
I'm actually
not that difficult.

04:27.694 --> 04:29.029
Don't do anything
to disappoint me,

04:29.062 --> 04:30.130
and we'll get along fine.

04:30.163 --> 04:30.864
HEEP: So, I could...

04:30.897 --> 04:32.899
ROSE: Sally,

04:32.933 --> 04:34.133
if you dress like that,

04:34.167 --> 04:35.769
people will get
the right idea about you.

04:35.802 --> 04:37.637
Please, go home and change.

04:37.671 --> 04:40.373
You can't keep talking
to me like this.

04:40.406 --> 04:41.775
Woman-on-woman can still be

04:41.808 --> 04:43.409
sexual harassment.

04:43.443 --> 04:45.011
ROSE: Wonderful.
And if you look around,

04:45.045 --> 04:46.246
you might find someone
who cares.

04:46.279 --> 04:47.480
In the meantime,

04:47.514 --> 04:48.982
go home or wherever it was

04:49.015 --> 04:50.216
you woke up this morning

04:50.250 --> 04:51.351
and put on a different outfit.

04:53.219 --> 04:54.387
CRANE: At ease.

04:59.593 --> 05:02.102
Bill, Sarah,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.336
good to see you.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.671
BILL: Good to see us.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.640
You know, we hired you
14 months ago.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.141
We've been in here
dozens of times

05:08.174 --> 05:09.375
for meetings, depositions.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.578
We have never seen you.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.213
Our trial starts tomorrow.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.181
We came specifically for you,

05:15.215 --> 05:16.182
which we made clear.

05:16.216 --> 05:20.120
Sheldon Modry specializes
in wrongful death.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.321
He's uniquely qualified
to handle this,

05:21.354 --> 05:24.290
given the way
your daughter so...

05:26.893 --> 05:28.729
wrongfully died.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.698
Do you even remember

05:31.732 --> 05:33.033
how our daughter died?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.235
Of course I do.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.103
Such a shame.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.240
So wrongful.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.809
Tell me how my daughter died,

05:42.843 --> 05:43.610
Mr. Crane.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.151
Bill, Sarah,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.854
Mary died...

05:53.887 --> 05:55.155
when a store light
fixture fell,

05:55.188 --> 05:56.957
tragically, on her.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.367
Are you going to be trying
this case or not?

06:01.401 --> 06:04.738
I am going to be trying
this case.

06:07.473 --> 06:09.242
I beg your pardon?

06:09.275 --> 06:10.276
BERLUTI:
He's a friend, Eugene,

06:10.310 --> 06:13.179
so I'd like to you know help.

06:13.213 --> 06:15.115
You filed a motion
to suppress?

06:15.148 --> 06:18.251
BERLUTI: Yes, based
on the exclusionary rule.

06:18.284 --> 06:20.420
The client had a reasonable
expectation of privacy,

06:20.453 --> 06:22.556
which we feel was violated.

06:22.589 --> 06:25.491
You're planning to walk
into a court of law

06:25.526 --> 06:27.293
and argue that federal agents

06:27.327 --> 06:28.962
installed a listening device

06:28.995 --> 06:30.531
in your client's buttocks?

06:30.564 --> 06:31.965
I know it feels desperate.

06:31.998 --> 06:32.699
YOUNG: Desperate?

06:32.733 --> 06:34.134
Oh, it feels desperate?

06:34.167 --> 06:35.702
BERLUTI:
Eugene, if the evidence

06:35.736 --> 06:36.870
doesn't get suppressed,

06:36.903 --> 06:38.739
he goes away.

06:38.772 --> 06:40.541
This is one
of my oldest friends.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.409
I got to do this.

06:43.443 --> 06:46.146
He says when he had
a rigorous movement,

06:46.179 --> 06:48.982
he could hear a little
beeping sound.

06:51.518 --> 06:53.820
MODRY: You can't possibly
try this case.

06:53.854 --> 06:54.988
Why not?

06:55.021 --> 06:56.456
You don't know the facts.

06:56.489 --> 06:57.724
You don't know the law.

06:57.758 --> 06:59.059
Well, lay it out in a memo,

06:59.092 --> 07:01.134
one page, no more,
double-spaced.

07:01.167 --> 07:02.468
That's far
too complicated to--

07:02.503 --> 07:03.970
One page, double-space,

07:04.004 --> 07:04.638
off you go.

07:04.671 --> 07:05.806
Denny...

07:05.839 --> 07:07.473
CRANE: Edmond,
are we on today?

07:07.508 --> 07:09.776
EDMOND: Uh, no.
I have an emergency.

07:09.810 --> 07:11.512
Could I talk to you?

07:11.545 --> 07:12.679
Of course.

07:14.748 --> 07:16.082
(door opens)

07:18.351 --> 07:19.352
(door closes)

07:20.921 --> 07:21.622
It's my son.

07:21.655 --> 07:23.189
He's been arrested.

07:23.223 --> 07:24.290
Darryl?

07:24.324 --> 07:25.091
What for?

07:25.125 --> 07:27.127
Sexual assault,

07:27.160 --> 07:28.361
date rape,

07:28.394 --> 07:30.731
which he is innocent of.

07:30.764 --> 07:32.566
I know you don't do
criminal work anymore.

07:32.599 --> 07:34.467
I'll take care of it.

07:34.501 --> 07:36.436
He's a wonderful
young man, Denny,

07:36.469 --> 07:37.370
and you know him.

07:37.403 --> 07:39.372
He would--

07:39.405 --> 07:42.042
Edmund...

07:42.075 --> 07:43.777
I'll take care of it.

07:48.081 --> 07:50.016
MODRY: Denny is insisting
on trying a case

07:50.050 --> 07:51.417
that he knows
nothing about,

07:51.451 --> 07:52.819
tomorrow.

07:52.853 --> 07:55.321
He settled a claim
behind my back.

07:55.355 --> 07:57.290
GORE: He lit my tie on fire

07:57.323 --> 07:58.825
because it was red.

07:58.859 --> 08:00.400
He referred me to a surgeon

08:00.433 --> 08:02.368
to get my breasts done.
MAN: That is inappropriate.

08:02.402 --> 08:03.369
MAN: What are you gonna do
about it?

08:03.403 --> 08:04.104
I can't work like this.

08:04.137 --> 08:05.806
(indistinct chatter)

08:05.839 --> 08:07.373
BILLINGS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:07.407 --> 08:09.109
Let's all take a breath.

08:11.144 --> 08:12.478
Richard, as I understand it,

08:12.513 --> 08:14.014
the case he settled
behind your back

08:14.047 --> 08:15.448
was for more money
than you were prepared

08:15.481 --> 08:16.482
to close on.

08:17.684 --> 08:20.353
Mitchell,
the tie smoked a little.

08:20.386 --> 08:21.722
It did not go ablaze.

08:22.889 --> 08:23.924
And Julie,

08:23.957 --> 08:25.692
you've been complaining
about your breasts

08:25.726 --> 08:26.827
for three months.

08:26.860 --> 08:28.762
MODRY: No, you seem to be
the only one

08:28.795 --> 08:30.296
who can handle
this man, Matthew.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.065
You need to somehow
rein him in--

08:32.097 --> 08:33.833
This is Alan Shore,
Sheldon.

08:33.866 --> 08:35.736
In addition to being
a gifted attorney,

08:35.769 --> 08:36.937
he's an accomplished

08:36.970 --> 08:38.104
Denny Crane wrangler.

08:38.138 --> 08:39.706
He'll join you
at tomorrow's trial.

08:39.740 --> 08:40.741
What?

08:40.774 --> 08:42.708
BILLINGS: Please,
let's all remember,

08:42.743 --> 08:44.177
when dealing with Denny,

08:44.210 --> 08:45.211
deep down,

08:45.245 --> 08:47.280
beneath that amusing exterior,

08:47.313 --> 08:48.414
his name comes first

08:48.448 --> 08:49.550
on the letterhead.

08:49.583 --> 08:50.450
(exhales slowly)

08:50.483 --> 08:52.553
Hannah, I need you now,
sweetheart.

08:52.586 --> 08:53.353
MAN: That's it?!

08:53.386 --> 08:55.188
(all shouting indistinctly)

08:56.289 --> 08:57.691
MAN: What you gonna do about it?

08:57.724 --> 08:59.860
A son of a client
just got arrested

08:59.893 --> 09:00.594
for date rape.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.035
Denny just asked me--
Oh, no.

09:02.068 --> 09:03.937
Big client, Hannah.
You're an ex-D. A.

09:03.970 --> 09:05.471
You might be able to--
I told you no more criminal--

09:05.506 --> 09:07.207
Please, don't make me beg.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.408
Remember what happened
the last time

09:08.441 --> 09:09.242
I got on my knees?

09:09.275 --> 09:10.877
Don't flatter yourself.

09:10.911 --> 09:11.745
You weren't that great.

09:11.778 --> 09:14.515
Well, I need you
to be, Hannah,

09:14.548 --> 09:16.082
like only you can.

09:16.116 --> 09:17.918
Yes, and you're not that
charming, either.

09:17.951 --> 09:20.453
I left the D. A.'s office
to get away from--

09:20.486 --> 09:21.655
Denny promised the client

09:21.688 --> 09:24.190
we'd make it go away,

09:24.224 --> 09:26.593
and I promise
I'll make it up to you.

09:30.196 --> 09:31.532
Pretty please?

09:32.633 --> 09:33.333
Hmm?

09:34.801 --> 09:36.570
Date rape.

09:36.603 --> 09:38.238
Mmm.

09:38.271 --> 09:40.841
What do you mean
I can't take it?

09:40.874 --> 09:42.843
Obviously, this is a very
precarious time

09:42.876 --> 09:43.510
for the firm.

09:43.544 --> 09:44.811
Which is why I would think

09:44.845 --> 09:46.112
we could use clients, even--

09:46.146 --> 09:48.181
FRUTT: Not that client.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.617
FRUTT: Manny is one
of my oldest friends.

09:50.651 --> 09:51.484
YOUNG: Jimmy,

09:51.518 --> 09:52.753
the absurdity of this motion

09:52.786 --> 09:54.320
would damage our credibility,

09:54.354 --> 09:56.322
and that would hurt
our other clients.

09:56.356 --> 09:58.158
I want to take this case.

09:58.191 --> 10:00.060
We're voting two to one

10:00.093 --> 10:02.035
to turn it down.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.837
You know, I never come
to you and ask--

10:03.870 --> 10:05.405
FRUTT:
We understand that, Jimmy,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.674
and if it were anything
but this,

10:07.708 --> 10:10.110
we would probably say yes,

10:10.143 --> 10:12.345
but this firm
cannot go into court

10:12.378 --> 10:14.080
and claim that the FBI

10:14.114 --> 10:15.649
bugged the client's ass.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.751
We don't know
for sure they didn't.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.786
The stuff that's going on
these days--

10:19.820 --> 10:20.987
YOUNG: Fine.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.455
Get some evidence
to support it,

10:22.488 --> 10:23.890
we'll reconsider,

10:23.924 --> 10:25.526
but for now,

10:25.559 --> 10:27.594
we're not taking the case.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.744
CRANE: I specifically asked

10:43.777 --> 10:45.979
for a one-page memo,
soldier.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.248
You've given me
a page and a half.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.016
Well, I thought
since it is double-spaced,

10:50.050 --> 10:52.485
I won't read it.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.654
I like to read.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.955
What are you doing here?

10:55.355 --> 10:56.156
SHORE: Matthew thought
my presence

10:56.189 --> 10:57.791
could add prowess.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.192
There's no need for prowess

10:59.225 --> 11:00.934
when I'm in the room,
Denny Crane.

11:02.002 --> 11:04.571
Oh, gentlemen,
this is Alan Shore.

11:04.605 --> 11:05.772
He'll be joining us today,

11:05.806 --> 11:07.541
and I believe you all know

11:07.574 --> 11:08.542
Denny Crane.

11:09.409 --> 11:11.377
CRANE: A woman is dead here.

11:11.411 --> 11:14.515
$1.2 million isn't gonna
bring her back to life.

11:16.416 --> 11:18.484
Do you have a figure
that will bring her back?

11:18.519 --> 11:20.120
$2.3 million.

11:21.387 --> 11:22.455
(clears throat)

11:24.691 --> 11:25.526
Mr. Crane...

11:25.559 --> 11:28.028
the decedent was not
a college graduate.

11:28.061 --> 11:29.530
Her earning capacity
is limited.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.363
No pain and suffering,

11:30.396 --> 11:31.698
no loss of consortium.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.133
The jury verdict research
on an instant death

11:33.166 --> 11:35.435
with no dependents
is $875,000 structured.

11:35.468 --> 11:36.903
We're offering
$1.2 million up front,

11:36.937 --> 11:38.038
it's generous.

11:38.071 --> 11:39.806
I don't like
fast little talkers.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.341
They remind me of chipmunks.

11:41.374 --> 11:42.208
Denny--

11:42.242 --> 11:43.309
TALBOT:
The fixture satisfied

11:43.343 --> 11:44.678
all safety requirements.

11:44.711 --> 11:46.046
It never should have fallen.

11:46.079 --> 11:47.748
But it did,

11:47.781 --> 11:50.851
on Mary Finnerty's head,

11:50.884 --> 11:52.619
killing her,

11:52.653 --> 11:54.621
irreparably.

11:54.655 --> 11:55.922
Now, listen, son,

11:55.956 --> 11:57.991
your client, All Shop,

11:58.024 --> 12:00.967
they have over 3,000

12:01.001 --> 12:02.302
stores nationwide,

12:02.335 --> 12:05.171
that's 57,000
lighting fixtures

12:05.205 --> 12:07.608
just in the good,
old U. S. of A.

12:07.641 --> 12:09.209
What if they all fell down, man?

12:10.577 --> 12:12.212
We're not talking about
one little accident

12:12.245 --> 12:15.115
that killed
Mary Finnerty's head.

12:16.316 --> 12:18.384
This could wipe out
hundreds of thousands

12:18.418 --> 12:20.787
of innocent people,

12:23.023 --> 12:24.190
Denny Crane.

12:32.933 --> 12:34.134
DARRYL:
The sex was consensual.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.570
I give you my word,
Ms. Rose.

12:36.603 --> 12:39.039
ROSE: Well, her word
seems to be "Rape,"

12:39.072 --> 12:40.440
and since there's both
torn clothing

12:40.473 --> 12:41.908
and vaginal bruising--

12:41.942 --> 12:43.109
She's making it up.

12:43.143 --> 12:45.078
Why would she do this?

12:45.111 --> 12:46.412
Because rape trials are fun?

12:46.446 --> 12:47.714
DARRYL: I dated this girl.

12:47.748 --> 12:49.550
We had sex before,

12:49.583 --> 12:50.617
consensual.

12:50.651 --> 12:52.118
WILSON:
But if you'd had sex before,

12:52.152 --> 12:53.486
why would she now be saying

12:53.520 --> 12:54.755
that she was raped?

12:54.788 --> 12:56.623
Excuse me a second.

13:00.466 --> 13:02.368
I realize that everyone
is different,

13:02.402 --> 13:04.404
but I don't like
my paralegals to talk.

13:04.437 --> 13:06.673
I'm happy to receive
your input later.

13:08.842 --> 13:11.878
But I am so ready
to give it to you now.

13:14.247 --> 13:16.182
Obviously, for you to speak

13:16.216 --> 13:18.084
to a junior partner like that,

13:18.118 --> 13:20.987
you must be screwing
a senior partner.

13:26.527 --> 13:29.029
So Darryl, any ideas?

13:29.062 --> 13:30.496
We have a woman here
with bruises,

13:30.531 --> 13:32.465
ripped clothing,

13:32.498 --> 13:34.267
I'm looking for a little
direction here.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.437
Well, her father
was very abusive to her

13:37.470 --> 13:38.705
when she was younger.

13:38.739 --> 13:40.406
He even sexually assaulted her.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.076
And...

13:43.109 --> 13:44.911
DARRYL: And I'm not a shrink,

13:44.945 --> 13:46.547
but a buddy of mine is.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.249
He said we could argue that

13:49.282 --> 13:51.117
because of what her father did,

13:51.151 --> 13:53.486
she psychologically--

13:53.520 --> 13:54.755
I don't know, gets turned on

13:54.788 --> 13:56.189
by mistreatment and stuff,

13:56.222 --> 13:57.958
which, personally,
I think she does,

13:57.991 --> 13:59.192
a little,

13:59.225 --> 13:59.960
which is why, you know,

13:59.993 --> 14:02.368
we were having rough sex,

14:02.402 --> 14:04.437
and that would account
for the bruises and stuff.

14:06.006 --> 14:07.240
Also...

14:07.273 --> 14:09.743
she's African-American.

14:11.778 --> 14:14.047
I'm sure the relevance
of that is obvious,

14:14.080 --> 14:17.050
but could you run it
by me, anyway?

14:17.083 --> 14:20.453
Well, a Boston jury is likely

14:20.486 --> 14:23.089
to take my word over hers.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.391
Plus, African-American women

14:25.425 --> 14:28.228
like sex, you know...

14:30.130 --> 14:31.532
rougher.

14:31.565 --> 14:34.500
(music playing)

14:38.138 --> 14:40.040
What do you mean
you can't take my case?

14:40.073 --> 14:42.909
My firm, they voted
against it.

14:42.943 --> 14:44.511
I thought you were a partner.

14:44.545 --> 14:46.513
BERLUTI: I am, but...

14:46.547 --> 14:47.948
I was outvoted, Manny.

14:47.981 --> 14:50.617
Jimmy, if I don't suppress
this evidence,

14:50.651 --> 14:52.553
I'm looking at eight years.

14:52.586 --> 14:54.454
I tried.

14:54.487 --> 14:55.789
I don't understand it.

14:55.822 --> 14:57.023
It's a criminal firm.

14:57.057 --> 14:57.824
You're a partner.

14:57.858 --> 14:59.526
I'm a criminal.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.568
And, besides,
you're my friend here.

15:01.602 --> 15:02.869
I know, but--

15:02.903 --> 15:04.771
QUINN: But nothing, Jimmy.

15:04.805 --> 15:06.640
Do you remember
when you passed the bar?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.374
We threw that great big party.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.710
And you gave this great speech

15:09.743 --> 15:11.477
about what it meant,

15:11.512 --> 15:12.579
how you were finally
gonna be able

15:12.613 --> 15:14.180
to help your friends.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.850
Well, here I am,
coming to you for help.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.685
Now, what's the deal?

15:22.288 --> 15:23.924
(gunshot)

15:23.957 --> 15:24.925
SHORE: We look ridiculous.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.293
You must really love to shoot.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.261
This is America.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.796
Everybody loves to shoot.

15:29.830 --> 15:32.065
Guns are what makes
America great.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.167
There are more guns
in American households

15:34.200 --> 15:35.569
than pet dogs.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.737
SHORE: Listen,
as soon as we can get

15:36.770 --> 15:37.838
the guns to fetch,

15:37.871 --> 15:39.573
we can lick this damn dog

15:39.606 --> 15:41.074
problem completely.

15:42.843 --> 15:45.178
(cocks)

15:45.211 --> 15:47.247
CRANE: Osama! Pull!

15:47.280 --> 15:48.148
(gunshot)

15:49.315 --> 15:50.584
Saddam! Pull!

15:50.617 --> 15:52.519
(gunshot)

15:52.553 --> 15:54.287
Kerry! Pull!

15:54.320 --> 15:55.288
(gunshot)

15:55.321 --> 15:56.322
See?

15:56.356 --> 15:57.423
The trick is,
you got to w--

15:57.457 --> 15:58.158
(gunshot)

15:58.191 --> 15:58.925
CRANE: Oh.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.201
Whoa, Nellie.

16:01.234 --> 16:02.803
The trick is,
you got to want to hit

16:02.836 --> 16:04.337
the target.

16:04.370 --> 16:06.039
Okay.

16:06.072 --> 16:07.040
MAN: Pull!

16:07.073 --> 16:09.776
(gunshot)

16:09.810 --> 16:12.012
Mother! Pull!

16:12.045 --> 16:13.079
(gunshot)

16:14.480 --> 16:15.982
Did you say, "Mother"?

16:16.016 --> 16:17.884
I only meant to scare her.

16:17.918 --> 16:18.819
MAN: Pull!

16:18.852 --> 16:19.853
(gunshot)

16:24.357 --> 16:26.259
SHORE: Now that we've played
guns together,

16:26.292 --> 16:27.493
can I be candid, Denny?

16:28.895 --> 16:30.163
I've had the opportunity

16:30.196 --> 16:31.532
to observe you for a while

16:31.565 --> 16:33.466
from up close and afar,

16:33.499 --> 16:37.370
and I've consistently

16:37.403 --> 16:38.905
noticed something.

16:38.939 --> 16:40.907
Like what?

16:40.941 --> 16:43.944
You're not well.

16:43.977 --> 16:45.612
People in your firm

16:45.646 --> 16:46.947
aren't gonna tell you that,

16:46.980 --> 16:48.982
because they like you,

16:49.015 --> 16:51.685
plus you wield
a great deal of power,

16:51.718 --> 16:54.621
but you have
about as much business

16:54.655 --> 16:56.122
being in that
courtroom tomorrow

16:56.156 --> 16:58.258
as you do holding
a loaded shotgun.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.268
Do you know
who you're talking to?

17:02.302 --> 17:04.871
Look...

17:04.905 --> 17:06.940
I offer this because,

17:06.973 --> 17:09.041
"A," I don't care
if I get fired,

17:09.075 --> 17:12.278
and, "B," someone
very dear to me

17:12.311 --> 17:14.180
died with Alzheimer's.

17:14.981 --> 17:18.318
And when I think
I see symptoms,

17:18.351 --> 17:22.623
even the possibility
of symptoms...

17:28.261 --> 17:29.996
The fact that you may have
Alzheimer's

17:30.030 --> 17:32.498
does not entitle you
to criticize me.

17:35.001 --> 17:35.936
Denny...

17:37.370 --> 17:40.240
these people, the Finnertys,

17:40.273 --> 17:43.644
have waited 14 months for trial.

17:43.677 --> 17:45.411
You--
They want me.

17:45.445 --> 17:47.914
SHORE: Because they think
you're prepared.

17:47.948 --> 17:51.752
Who do you think you are, hmm?

17:51.785 --> 17:52.886
I hire you,

17:52.919 --> 17:54.087
you're here a week,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.056
now you're trying
to tell me what to do?

17:56.089 --> 17:57.891
Nobody, nobody...

17:59.726 --> 18:02.703
tells me what to do.

18:09.976 --> 18:10.744
Dad...

18:13.446 --> 18:14.347
you're my father,

18:14.380 --> 18:16.316
and you don't even remember.

18:20.954 --> 18:22.523
I'm not your father.

18:22.556 --> 18:24.357
I had you for a second.

18:24.390 --> 18:27.994
Don't you laugh at me.

18:31.264 --> 18:32.699
I'm healthy.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.100
I'm the picture of health.

18:36.903 --> 18:37.704
(glass thumps)

18:43.076 --> 18:44.711
BERLUTI:
When I went to law school,

18:44.745 --> 18:46.613
it wasn't to get rich or...

18:49.282 --> 18:51.552
I had a lot of buddies
who got in jams.

18:51.585 --> 18:53.486
I became a lawyer

18:53.520 --> 18:55.155
to help my friends.

18:55.188 --> 18:57.824
It was that simple.

18:57.858 --> 18:59.726
There was something
about that that seemed

18:59.760 --> 19:02.368
very glamorous to me,

19:02.402 --> 19:03.804
and it still does.

19:05.405 --> 19:06.873
Really?

19:06.907 --> 19:09.075
BERLUTI: Get some space
in the North End,

19:09.109 --> 19:10.343
wake up every morning,

19:10.376 --> 19:11.277
drop my laundry off

19:11.311 --> 19:12.646
at the Fluff and Fold,

19:12.679 --> 19:14.047
have coffee
with Lenny and Sal

19:14.080 --> 19:15.682
at Maury's Doughnuts,

19:15.716 --> 19:18.819
help Steve get the Denver boot
off his pickup,

19:18.852 --> 19:20.020
help Sylvia get a loan

19:20.053 --> 19:22.723
even though
she's got no credit,

19:22.756 --> 19:24.057
negotiate a better price

19:24.090 --> 19:27.761
on a condo for my Aunt Mary,

19:27.794 --> 19:30.296
help the people
I really care about

19:30.330 --> 19:32.933
to live better lives,
you know.

19:32.966 --> 19:34.568
Then close up early enough

19:34.601 --> 19:37.638
to have supper with them.

19:37.671 --> 19:40.874
That sounds like a life to me,

19:40.907 --> 19:42.442
a rich one, even.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.517
You have to do it.

19:51.785 --> 19:52.753
Do what?

19:52.786 --> 19:54.821
Hang a shingle
on the North End,

19:54.855 --> 19:55.956
help Aunt Mary
with her credit,

19:55.989 --> 19:57.290
help Lenny with...

19:59.325 --> 20:00.433
you have to do it.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.237
I can't abandon the firm now

20:04.270 --> 20:05.338
of all times.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.040
STRINGER: Jimmy,
the word on the street

20:07.073 --> 20:10.476
is our firm is over.

20:12.846 --> 20:14.615
I've been looking.

20:16.116 --> 20:17.183
You have?

20:17.718 --> 20:19.485
And get this,

20:19.520 --> 20:20.253
one of my close friends

20:20.286 --> 20:23.223
is a headhunter.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.358
Eugene's put his name
out there.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.493
What?

20:27.528 --> 20:28.729
Eugene?

20:28.762 --> 20:29.763
STRINGER: Three weeks ago,
he interviewed

20:29.796 --> 20:31.264
at Hollings and Gray.

20:31.732 --> 20:34.601
That's not even the point.

20:34.635 --> 20:37.070
You have to go do this

20:37.103 --> 20:39.172
because it's what
you want to do.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.877
You have to do it.

20:55.989 --> 20:57.457
ROSE: It's not just
going away, Matthew,

20:57.490 --> 20:58.859
especially not quickly.

20:58.892 --> 20:59.660
He raped her.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.067
Not what I want to hear.

21:01.101 --> 21:03.436
Look, get the new guy
to do this.

21:03.469 --> 21:04.705
He's done criminal cases.
The new guy...

21:04.738 --> 21:07.373
is in court
on Denny Crane control.

21:07.407 --> 21:08.875
I told you when I came here

21:08.909 --> 21:12.145
it was to get away
from criminal law.

21:12.178 --> 21:13.980
I have an official
complaint to lodge,

21:14.014 --> 21:15.215
and since it's about her,

21:15.248 --> 21:16.983
she might as well
be present for it.

21:17.017 --> 21:18.585
I fight my battles open.

21:18.619 --> 21:20.821
You might want to opt
for an adverb there, Sal,

21:20.854 --> 21:22.789
"Openly" would support
your predicate.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.126
"Open" would describe
your leg position at the bar.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.160
HEEP: I want that
on the record.

21:27.193 --> 21:29.563
HALL: Ooh, the girls
are fighting.

21:29.596 --> 21:30.496
I've got a big one, Glenn.

21:30.531 --> 21:31.798
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.266
Oh, please.

21:33.299 --> 21:34.601
Hannah.

21:34.635 --> 21:35.569
Glenn.

21:35.602 --> 21:37.070
Date rape, we need to find

21:37.103 --> 21:38.739
some credibility issues quickly.

21:38.772 --> 21:41.041
The victim's name
is Candace Watson.

21:41.074 --> 21:42.709
Suspect's father
is a blue chip.

21:42.743 --> 21:43.844
We'll get you employee records,

21:43.877 --> 21:45.846
school transcripts,
credit report.

21:45.879 --> 21:47.881
Your hair,

21:47.914 --> 21:49.115
it's so you.

21:49.149 --> 21:50.316
Mmm.

21:52.085 --> 21:52.786
Hi.

21:52.819 --> 21:53.954
Hi.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.289
We're not simply looking
to prevail at trial.

21:56.322 --> 21:58.324
The goal would be
to squash this now.

22:00.767 --> 22:01.835
I need this.

22:08.909 --> 22:09.576
(scoffs)

22:12.178 --> 22:13.880
Denny, I am begging you,

22:13.914 --> 22:15.982
I've prepared this opening
for three weeks.

22:16.016 --> 22:17.183
Overkill.

22:18.251 --> 22:19.920
(sighs) Alan...

22:21.855 --> 22:22.889
We don't want to steal
the thunder

22:22.923 --> 22:24.190
from your closing, Denny.

22:24.224 --> 22:26.660
Not gonna get
to a closing, no, sir.

22:27.093 --> 22:28.261
WHITE: Mr. Crane,

22:31.197 --> 22:32.465
we'll hear from you.

22:37.470 --> 22:38.505
CRANE: Denny Crane,

22:38.539 --> 22:40.140
I represent the plaintiff.

22:40.173 --> 22:41.675
And here's what's gonna happen.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.110
A whole lot of witnesses
are gonna get up and,

22:44.144 --> 22:45.946
tell you how and why...

22:45.979 --> 22:47.848
All Shop's lighting fixture

22:47.881 --> 22:49.983
fell on Mary Finnerty's head,

22:50.016 --> 22:52.586
killing her.

22:52.619 --> 22:54.655
The defense is gonna get up,
have their say,

22:54.688 --> 22:56.690
then I'll get up again

22:56.723 --> 22:58.525
and ask you to give...

22:58.559 --> 23:00.366
Sarah and Bill Finnerty

23:00.400 --> 23:01.835
a whole lot of money.

23:01.868 --> 23:04.237
Now, it's difficult to put a...

23:04.270 --> 23:07.107
price on a human life,
I grant you,

23:07.140 --> 23:09.743
but this is All Shop.

23:09.776 --> 23:11.077
And as the defense counsel

23:11.111 --> 23:13.313
was so quick
to point out to me,

23:13.346 --> 23:15.882
they have over 3,000 stores
in this country,

23:15.916 --> 23:17.651
10,000 internationally.

23:17.684 --> 23:20.587
We're not talking about
one lighting fixture.

23:20.621 --> 23:22.889
We're talking about a lot
of lives at stake here.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.257
Objection.

23:24.290 --> 23:25.458
Sustained.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.628
Mr. Crane, can we talk
about this case only?

23:27.661 --> 23:28.695
Can we do that?

23:28.729 --> 23:29.796
Oh, of course.

23:29.830 --> 23:31.497
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

23:42.876 --> 23:44.210
Um...

23:55.221 --> 23:57.758
value of human life,

23:59.125 --> 24:00.433
it's a bugger.

24:01.467 --> 24:03.036
My friend Jerry Spence
tells the story

24:03.069 --> 24:05.338
of this paper boy
delivering his papers

24:05.371 --> 24:06.673
on his morning route one day.

24:06.707 --> 24:08.441
He throws the paper
through the window,

24:08.474 --> 24:11.011
shatters the glass,

24:11.044 --> 24:12.813
blinds a woman.

24:15.348 --> 24:17.017
What's the value of that?

24:19.586 --> 24:22.556
The paper boy decides
to give the woman

24:24.024 --> 24:25.959
his profits for the week,
not very much,

24:25.992 --> 24:28.094
considering she was blinded.

24:28.128 --> 24:31.264
Now, here
we have a loss of life,

24:31.297 --> 24:32.933
an avoidable loss,

24:32.966 --> 24:35.135
not merely an accident,

24:35.168 --> 24:38.138
one they could have prevented.

24:38.171 --> 24:40.807
So, I think the paper boy
had the right idea.

24:40.841 --> 24:42.809
At the end of this trial,
I'm gonna get up,

24:42.843 --> 24:44.477
I'm gonna ask the defendant

24:44.511 --> 24:46.913
to pay my client
one week's profit.

24:48.114 --> 24:50.951
No, let's make that
a day's profit.

24:50.984 --> 24:53.119
Let's not get greedy here.

24:53.153 --> 24:54.320
We may not be able
to put a price

24:54.354 --> 24:55.922
on Mary Finnerty's life,

24:55.956 --> 24:59.325
but we can at least
pay her family

24:59.359 --> 25:02.035
the profits for the day
they killed her.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.772
What could be more
fair than that?

25:07.340 --> 25:08.074
Hmm?

25:10.744 --> 25:12.913
My client's profits
are not relevant.

25:13.514 --> 25:16.316
The number of stores
they have is not relevant.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.118
How dare you go into that?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.153
And how dare you
not shut him down?

25:20.654 --> 25:22.889
CRANE: May I go off
the record briefly?

25:22.923 --> 25:24.090
Go right ahead.

25:24.124 --> 25:25.125
Thank you.

25:25.158 --> 25:27.928
This is not for your ears,
by the way.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.463
You stupid bastard.

25:30.496 --> 25:32.533
Cases rarely turn on
what's legally relevant.

25:32.566 --> 25:34.868
What you have
to be concerned with here

25:34.901 --> 25:37.671
is that All Shop makes
$160 million

25:37.704 --> 25:39.573
of pure profit a day, a day,

25:39.606 --> 25:41.542
in gross revenues,
$800 million.

25:41.575 --> 25:42.876
In the 20 minutes
it took the ambulance

25:42.909 --> 25:45.579
to reach Mary Finnerty's
crushed head,

25:45.612 --> 25:47.748
your client took in $10 million.

25:48.481 --> 25:49.716
That might slip out in court,

25:49.750 --> 25:51.251
and even if it doesn't,

25:51.284 --> 25:52.352
look at this face.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.354
It comes with its own publicist.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.557
The jury will get wind
of those numbers.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.258
In which case, we'll appeal.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.392
CRANE: Great.
And do you think

25:59.425 --> 26:01.101
you'll be the lawyers
to handle that appeal

26:01.134 --> 26:02.168
when your client gets whacked

26:02.202 --> 26:04.505
with a $50-million judgment?

26:04.538 --> 26:06.072
You're an ass.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.207
You're an ass.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.275
You're an ass.

26:09.309 --> 26:11.545
How about we settle this case

26:11.578 --> 26:13.814
like your careers
depended on it?

26:15.582 --> 26:17.417
Dumb bastards.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.219
I'm sorry.
Where were we?

26:23.189 --> 26:24.758
Leaving?

26:24.791 --> 26:25.992
BERLUTI: I've been thinking
about this

26:26.026 --> 26:28.394
for a long time,
and now--

26:28.428 --> 26:29.763
Because you couldn't
take that case?

26:29.796 --> 26:31.898
In part, yes.

26:31.932 --> 26:34.000
The truth is,
I've always wanted

26:34.034 --> 26:35.335
to hang my own shingle.

26:35.368 --> 26:36.670
I'm 43 years old.

26:36.703 --> 26:38.972
If I don't do it now,
when, then?

26:39.005 --> 26:40.974
Considering what we're
going through now,

26:41.007 --> 26:42.408
how can you even think
of leaving?

26:42.776 --> 26:43.644
You are.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.447
You interviewed with Hollings
and Gray last month.

26:48.615 --> 26:49.950
FRUTT: Is that true, Eugene?

26:49.983 --> 26:51.084
They called
for an interview.

26:51.117 --> 26:51.918
I declined.

26:51.952 --> 26:53.019
No, you didn't.

26:53.053 --> 26:54.087
I declined the job.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.922
But not the interview.

26:55.956 --> 26:58.158
You considered leaving, Eugene.

26:58.191 --> 26:59.325
That's what I've been doing.

26:59.359 --> 27:01.467
We just came
to different conclusions.

27:01.501 --> 27:03.604
Do you have any idea
how difficult

27:03.637 --> 27:05.271
it would be
to launch a practice?

27:05.305 --> 27:06.840
Probably not,

27:06.873 --> 27:09.743
but I'm not coming
totally from logic here.

27:09.776 --> 27:11.411
This is emotional.

27:11.444 --> 27:13.013
FRUTT: Given that,

27:13.046 --> 27:15.115
why don't you at least wait

27:15.148 --> 27:17.618
to see if this impulse passes?

27:18.251 --> 27:19.620
The truth is, Ellenor,

27:19.653 --> 27:22.055
I've been wanting to leave
for a hundred years.

27:23.089 --> 27:25.058
I love this and all of you,

27:25.091 --> 27:27.661
don't get me wrong,

27:27.694 --> 27:29.462
but what I really want to do,

27:29.495 --> 27:32.132
deep down,

27:32.165 --> 27:33.166
this isn't it.

27:35.969 --> 27:38.605
I'll pitch in, handle cases,

27:38.639 --> 27:41.875
whatever you need.
I won't abandon you.

27:41.908 --> 27:43.777
But I got to do this.

27:45.746 --> 27:47.848
(sighs)

27:47.881 --> 27:49.616
And when would you do this?

27:51.251 --> 27:52.653
Today.

27:52.686 --> 27:54.420
It needs to be now.

28:00.133 --> 28:02.235
HEEP: I'm sick of her
not respecting me.

28:02.268 --> 28:03.737
I made law review
at Holy Cross,

28:03.770 --> 28:05.506
top 10% of my class,

28:05.539 --> 28:06.840
and people totally dismiss me

28:06.873 --> 28:08.341
because of the way I dress.

28:11.144 --> 28:13.313
Well, then,
let's talk about your dress.

28:13.346 --> 28:16.016
HEEP: I get clients because
of the way I look, Matthew.

28:16.049 --> 28:17.383
People approach me--

28:17.417 --> 28:18.852
Men approach you.

28:18.885 --> 28:20.887
Yes, many of whom
go on to hire me.

28:20.921 --> 28:24.324
And is that how you plan
to carve out your career?

28:28.261 --> 28:29.663
You know, you're right.

28:31.097 --> 28:34.434
Law review,
top 10% of your class,

28:34.467 --> 28:37.103
firms all over town should have
been extending offers.

28:38.705 --> 28:40.140
How many did?

28:44.077 --> 28:46.112
Sally, you're an attorney.

28:48.949 --> 28:52.085
I'm also 25, and I'm not
gonna dress like I'm 40.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.255
My legal skills
are excellent.

28:55.288 --> 28:57.057
I shouldn't get punished

28:57.090 --> 28:58.291
because my skirts are short.

28:58.324 --> 29:01.001
And you can tell Hannah
I'm gonna hit her.

29:01.034 --> 29:02.603
I don't care
if she's a partner.

29:02.636 --> 29:03.737
If she keeps treating me
like this,

29:03.770 --> 29:05.138
I'm gonna hit her.

29:09.209 --> 29:12.145
(crying)

29:13.847 --> 29:14.815
I'm sorry.

29:16.883 --> 29:17.818
According to the seminars,

29:17.851 --> 29:19.920
I'm not supposed to hug you,

29:22.288 --> 29:24.157
but I'm gonna risk it.

29:26.092 --> 29:28.662
Hey, hey, hey. Shh.

29:28.695 --> 29:30.430
(crying)

29:30.463 --> 29:32.733
Shh. Oh, hey. It's okay.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.235
It's okay.

29:37.671 --> 29:38.839
HALL: Munchausen's,

29:38.872 --> 29:41.274
basically, it's a disorder
that causes people

29:41.307 --> 29:43.109
to make up or fake diseases.

29:43.143 --> 29:43.844
ROSE: I know what it is.

29:43.877 --> 29:45.378
Where did you get this?

29:45.411 --> 29:47.013
I should say,
how did you get this?

29:47.047 --> 29:49.215
I don't think you mean
to ask me that.

29:49.249 --> 29:52.485
Was she ever actually
diagnosed with Munchausen's?

29:52.519 --> 29:54.320
She doesn't have it.

29:55.522 --> 29:57.257
Then why is she
on a hospital list?

29:57.290 --> 29:59.125
HALL: It's computer generated.

29:59.159 --> 30:01.668
If a person is admitted
for treatment over and over,

30:01.702 --> 30:03.704
the name eventually might end up

30:03.737 --> 30:05.939
on a possible
Munchausen list.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.475
Even if the injuries are legit?

30:09.510 --> 30:10.877
Shouldn't happen,

30:10.911 --> 30:12.913
but one doctor along the way
had to wonder

30:12.946 --> 30:15.882
whether she was really
abused by her father.

30:15.916 --> 30:17.417
That's enough.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.162
Do you have a second?

30:31.231 --> 30:32.398
Sure.

30:37.704 --> 30:38.939
I'm gonna ask you this

30:38.972 --> 30:41.074
in a quiet,
refrained tone,

30:41.107 --> 30:43.043
so as not to seem like
I'm attacking you.

30:44.545 --> 30:45.679
How is it you could interview

30:45.712 --> 30:47.213
with another law firm at--

30:47.247 --> 30:48.682
YOUNG: Ellenor,

30:48.715 --> 30:50.116
they wanted to meet.

30:50.150 --> 30:51.552
I told them I was not
interested.

30:51.585 --> 30:53.820
They were persistent
about at least talking.

30:53.854 --> 30:55.956
I only agreed to hear them out.

30:55.989 --> 30:57.023
I did.

30:57.057 --> 30:58.258
I restated my position,

30:58.291 --> 31:00.500
that I had no interest
in leaving here,

31:00.534 --> 31:01.902
and that was the end of it.

31:01.935 --> 31:04.838
Was that before
or after you fired Alan?

31:05.539 --> 31:09.209
It was after the firm voted
to discharge Alan Shore.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.913
Eugene, I don't think
I need to lecture you

31:12.946 --> 31:15.248
on the importance
of perception.

31:15.281 --> 31:19.119
But for us, during an incredibly
vulnerable period,

31:19.152 --> 31:22.756
for our senior partner
to be seen interviewing--

31:22.789 --> 31:23.857
Nobody saw.

31:24.390 --> 31:25.491
The word was out.

31:25.526 --> 31:26.492
Jamie heard it.

31:26.527 --> 31:27.561
She told Jimmy.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.195
The word got out.

31:30.797 --> 31:33.199
Forget that I'm your partner.

31:34.868 --> 31:36.803
As your friend,

31:36.837 --> 31:38.104
if you're planning to bail--

31:38.739 --> 31:40.273
I'm not bailing.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.443
(sighs)

31:45.912 --> 31:47.614
Are we gonna survive, Eugene?

31:50.083 --> 31:52.519
We'll survive.

31:52.553 --> 31:54.955
I'm not bailing,

31:54.988 --> 31:56.723
and we'll survive.

32:02.703 --> 32:03.537
(sighs)

32:07.574 --> 32:09.109
What can I tell his father?

32:09.142 --> 32:11.311
That I'm meeting
with the D. A. This morning.

32:11.344 --> 32:12.278
Other than that,

32:13.614 --> 32:14.314
Tara...

32:14.347 --> 32:15.849
Copies of cases,

32:15.882 --> 32:17.050
first circuit's on top,

32:17.083 --> 32:18.819
Massachusetts
is the second tab,

32:18.852 --> 32:21.722
dictum and legislative
intent after that.

32:21.755 --> 32:22.556
Would you like me
to come with you?

32:22.589 --> 32:24.224
I would, actually,

32:24.257 --> 32:26.292
but I'm too afraid you'll talk.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.234
Would it kill you
to be kind?

32:34.768 --> 32:36.837
Actually, I was once,
and it almost did.

32:36.870 --> 32:39.973
Ah, so I get the blame
for how you treat people.

32:40.006 --> 32:42.509
Just the opposite,
I give you total credit.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.947
Hannah, I would hate
to be the only one

32:46.980 --> 32:48.615
to experience the tender you.

32:50.884 --> 32:52.085
It's late.

32:52.118 --> 32:53.854
I've got to go do good deeds.

32:59.626 --> 33:02.168
Sheldon, I heard you settled.

33:02.202 --> 33:03.236
Yeah.

33:03.269 --> 33:04.705
$6.5 million.

33:04.738 --> 33:06.507
Good result,
the client's pleased.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.008
$6.5 million...

33:08.041 --> 33:10.511
you were stuck between
$1.2 million and $2.3 million.

33:10.544 --> 33:11.612
How did you get $6.5 million?

33:12.879 --> 33:15.215
Denny did good work.

33:15.248 --> 33:16.917
So I don't need
to intervene today?

33:23.957 --> 33:25.626
Don't you love it here?

33:29.429 --> 33:33.199
These convictions
are extremely difficult to get,

33:33.233 --> 33:35.602
especially when the suspect
and victim

33:35.636 --> 33:38.038
once had
a consensual relationship.

33:38.071 --> 33:39.673
Well, their relationship--

33:39.706 --> 33:41.908
I'm not saying I won't get it.

33:41.942 --> 33:44.911
I'm just trying
to prepare you, Mr. Watson.

33:46.379 --> 33:47.480
(knocks on door)

33:48.114 --> 33:50.183
Kenny, I, uh...

33:50.216 --> 33:51.084
oh, I'm sorry.

33:51.117 --> 33:52.418
I didn't know you were busy.

33:54.054 --> 33:55.722
Actually, I did.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.593
(sighs) You're
Candace Watson's father?

33:59.626 --> 34:00.567
I am.

34:01.167 --> 34:02.402
Hannah Rose,

34:02.435 --> 34:03.704
I have the unfortunate task

34:03.737 --> 34:04.605
of defending the man

34:04.638 --> 34:05.438
who raped your daughter,

34:05.471 --> 34:07.007
who, between the three of us,

34:07.040 --> 34:08.775
I'm convinced is guilty.

34:09.676 --> 34:10.811
What do you want, Hannah?

34:10.844 --> 34:13.547
In the interest
of no surprises,

34:13.580 --> 34:14.414
medical report,

34:15.415 --> 34:18.150
a claim you once
abused your daughter.

34:19.284 --> 34:20.954
I'm sure you didn't.

34:20.987 --> 34:22.455
A hospital turned up her name

34:22.487 --> 34:23.956
as a possible Munchausen's.

34:23.989 --> 34:24.925
What is going on?
WALSH: Hannah, if you

34:24.958 --> 34:25.891
could excuse us, please?

34:25.926 --> 34:27.460
If she makes things up--

34:27.493 --> 34:28.293
WALSH: That's all, Hannah.

34:29.862 --> 34:30.563
I'm leaving.

34:33.667 --> 34:35.936
This can be used

34:35.969 --> 34:37.804
to pierce rape shield,

34:37.838 --> 34:39.639
which is vulnerable
to begin with.

34:40.139 --> 34:41.474
You might want to consider

34:41.507 --> 34:43.143
sparing your daughter
this trial.

34:43.176 --> 34:44.878
WALSH: Hannah.

34:44.911 --> 34:45.846
Get out.

34:46.446 --> 34:48.014
Misdemeanor assault,

34:48.047 --> 34:51.317
one year suspended,
that's a gift.

34:51.351 --> 34:52.953
None of us wants
to go to trial here.

34:57.423 --> 34:59.359
(door opens)

34:59.392 --> 35:00.466
(door closes)

35:02.769 --> 35:04.237
And the D. A. Agreed?

35:04.270 --> 35:06.172
I just got the call.

35:06.206 --> 35:08.642
Your son does get a conviction.

35:08.675 --> 35:09.943
But no jail?

35:09.976 --> 35:11.578
Assuming the judge signs off,

35:11.612 --> 35:12.979
which he should.

35:13.013 --> 35:15.081
Oh, thank God.

35:15.115 --> 35:16.583
You can thank Hannah.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.522
I don't know what to say.

35:22.956 --> 35:26.292
He's a fine young man,
Ms. Rose, and...

35:28.228 --> 35:31.031
Mr. Solomon, I can see
you're having a moment.

35:31.998 --> 35:33.333
But for my take on the facts,

35:33.366 --> 35:35.335
which includes an interview
with the fine, young man,

35:35.368 --> 35:36.269
he's a rapist.

35:41.642 --> 35:43.409
If he's to make anything
of this second chance,

35:43.443 --> 35:45.145
daddy needs to see
the fine, young man

35:45.178 --> 35:46.513
for what he is

35:46.547 --> 35:48.414
and get him
into some counseling.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.257
HEEP: They're all nuts.

35:57.290 --> 35:57.991
QUINLEN: Who?

35:58.024 --> 35:59.259
The partners.

36:01.167 --> 36:02.636
They've all totally
had work done.

36:03.336 --> 36:04.170
They have?

36:04.204 --> 36:05.806
Please.
Denny Crane's head

36:05.839 --> 36:07.073
is so pumped full of Botox.

36:07.107 --> 36:08.675
Even Hannah, pretty Hannah.

36:09.075 --> 36:09.943
Hannah Rose?

36:09.976 --> 36:11.077
HEEP: Yeah.

36:11.111 --> 36:12.145
She's in her 30s.

36:12.178 --> 36:13.614
So what?
She's pulled so tight,

36:13.647 --> 36:14.848
she's got to cross
her legs to smile.

36:18.284 --> 36:19.252
Oh, my God.

36:21.522 --> 36:22.889
(sighs)

36:23.690 --> 36:25.859
I guess it's lucky
I don't like to smile.

36:25.892 --> 36:26.927
I was just--

36:28.829 --> 36:29.930
Oh, my God.

36:35.368 --> 36:37.270
How much do we pay you, Sally?

36:39.105 --> 36:40.541
$160,000.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.977
Do you think
we pay you $160,000

36:44.010 --> 36:45.378
to come down here
to the storage room

36:45.411 --> 36:46.513
and smoke pot, Sally?

36:47.147 --> 36:48.048
No, ma'am.

36:49.616 --> 36:51.885
It would be a mistake
to call me "Ma'am."

36:53.854 --> 36:55.288
Give me the joint, Sally.

36:57.591 --> 36:58.424
Do you need to pee, Mark?

36:58.458 --> 37:00.967
Yes, ma'am, sir,

37:01.000 --> 37:02.802
Hannah.

37:02.836 --> 37:03.537
God.

37:03.570 --> 37:05.539
Go pee, Mark.

37:11.277 --> 37:13.412
I, like,

37:13.446 --> 37:15.281
so miscalculated my day.

37:16.349 --> 37:19.285
I've had a lousy day, too, Sal.

37:19.319 --> 37:21.221
I arranged
for a rapist to get off

37:21.254 --> 37:22.989
with just a slap
on the wrist.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.058
Now I need to go
buy something

37:25.091 --> 37:26.593
to feel better
about myself.

37:28.461 --> 37:30.831
I've been eyeing
this little purse, actually,

37:30.864 --> 37:32.866
it costs $900.

37:32.899 --> 37:36.302
Can you imagine,
$900 for a purse?

37:38.071 --> 37:40.340
Luckily, I can afford it.

37:40.373 --> 37:42.976
Partners here are well paid.

37:43.009 --> 37:45.679
I bet you hope
to be partner one day.

37:51.518 --> 37:54.154
Complain about me
to anyone ever again,

37:54.187 --> 37:57.123
even to your own mother,

37:57.157 --> 38:00.634
this little pot incident,

38:00.667 --> 38:02.168
comes to light.

38:24.124 --> 38:25.659
What the hell
are you doing in my office?

38:29.295 --> 38:31.064
Had you there again,
didn't I, dad?

38:31.832 --> 38:34.668
I've asked you not to make fun
of my mental health.

38:34.701 --> 38:36.970
As I recall,

38:37.003 --> 38:38.404
I meant it.

38:40.373 --> 38:43.443
If I offended you before,
I apologize.

38:45.311 --> 38:46.680
You know, you don't fool me.

38:50.050 --> 38:51.852
My success as a trial attorney

38:51.885 --> 38:53.854
comes from my ability
to read people.

38:56.156 --> 38:57.390
I read you.

39:00.534 --> 39:03.103
I know your little secret,
soldier.

39:04.571 --> 39:05.338
You do?

39:05.371 --> 39:07.440
Mm-hmm.

39:07.473 --> 39:09.843
You're in awe of me.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.649
Well, now that the secret's out,

39:18.418 --> 39:20.253
let me tell you something,
Denny Crane,

39:22.723 --> 39:26.392
having watched you
at the courthouse yesterday,

39:26.426 --> 39:28.228
I just want you to know,

39:29.129 --> 39:30.196
I am in awe.

39:33.534 --> 39:34.768
You're Denny Crane,

39:37.871 --> 39:40.206
and that's...

39:40.240 --> 39:41.474
something.

39:56.022 --> 39:58.324
You've taken up
a minute of my time.

39:59.926 --> 40:02.068
To whom do I send the bill?

40:04.237 --> 40:05.606
Send the bill to me.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.150
Best thing is, it's elegant.

40:17.183 --> 40:19.352
You can go dressy,
and it's casual.

40:19.385 --> 40:22.122
It goes with a sweater
and jeans just as well.

40:22.155 --> 40:24.157
And the size...

40:24.190 --> 40:26.259
Do you like to carry
a lot of stuff?

40:26.292 --> 40:27.994
Totally.

40:28.028 --> 40:30.430
Let's go with the big one.

40:30.463 --> 40:31.732
Oh, I'm jealous.

40:31.765 --> 40:33.934
I've been saving up
to get this same bag.

40:33.967 --> 40:35.101
Well, look on the bright side,

40:35.135 --> 40:36.803
if I saw it on you,
I'd no longer want it.

40:38.572 --> 40:40.406
Tell you what.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.842
Give me half off,

40:41.875 --> 40:42.643
I'll buy you one.

40:42.676 --> 40:44.277
WATSON: If only I could.

40:44.310 --> 40:46.246
Look, if you get home,
and you suddenly hate it,

40:46.279 --> 40:48.081
bring it back,
no problem.

40:48.114 --> 40:49.750
Not supposed to say it.

40:49.783 --> 40:50.984
Never heard it.

40:54.387 --> 40:55.622
What's the matter?

40:58.391 --> 41:00.934
Hannah Rose?

41:00.967 --> 41:02.135
You're an attorney?

41:04.170 --> 41:05.038
Why?

41:06.406 --> 41:08.041
My name is Candace Watson.

41:10.476 --> 41:12.312
Your client raped me
last week.

41:22.388 --> 41:23.924
(scoffs)

41:23.957 --> 41:26.192
Small town, Boston.

41:27.828 --> 41:31.497
Just sign here, please,
and you're good to go.

41:33.834 --> 41:35.101
Look, I, uh,

41:38.772 --> 41:39.773
(sighs)

41:44.344 --> 41:47.280
(music playing)

42:19.252 --> 42:22.188
(music playing)

42:45.579 --> 42:46.713
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:46.747 --> 42:49.415
(music playing)
