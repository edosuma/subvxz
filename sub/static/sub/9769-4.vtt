00:03.142 --> 00:04.497
Hey Mich...

00:04.498 --> 00:05.718
Are you studying again ?

00:05.719 --> 00:08.667
You realize how depressing
that is to come home to ?

00:08.668 --> 00:12.387
Depressing as coming home
to an empty lasagna tray ?

00:12.388 --> 00:13.800
TouchÃ©, Michael.

00:15.601 --> 00:19.011
It's just a reminder of the fact
that I have no social life out here.

00:19.012 --> 00:20.851
I'm the worst dry spell ever.

00:21.052 --> 00:23.109
My dry spell lasted 20 years but go on.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.981
I mean, in New York,
if you see a pretty girl,

00:25.982 --> 00:28.103
you can just walk right up
to her you know.

00:28.101 --> 00:29.090
But here they're all in cars.

00:29.099 --> 00:32.625
They go whipping pass me like
a million miles an hour.

00:32.627 --> 00:34.044
Like today...

00:34.048 --> 00:35.957
I saw this pretty girl driving toward me.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.116
So I make a U-turn

00:37.117 --> 00:38.863
and get a ticket for $800.

00:40.564 --> 00:42.239
$800 for a U-turn ?

00:42.540 --> 00:43.791
Yeah !

00:44.192 --> 00:46.635
We may have been
on a freeway at the time but...

00:49.036 --> 00:51.944
I just wish I had a regular place
where I could go and meet woman.

00:51.945 --> 00:53.754
You could go to bars.

00:53.755 --> 00:56.219
No, I'm getting too old for that.

00:56.220 --> 01:01.160
Plus I'm not great at telling wether
or not they're gay bars before I go in.

01:01.161 --> 01:03.261
By the way, if Ramon calls, I am not here.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.135 --> 01:41.753
Joey, come here. Look at this !

01:41.754 --> 01:43.527
The world is a freaking joke.

01:45.328 --> 01:48.950
Cargo pants are five minutes ago ?
The world is a freaking joke !

01:49.951 --> 01:52.380
No, the thing about the celebrity hairstylist.

01:52.381 --> 01:55.273
I went to cosmetology school
with that girl and she was terrible.

01:55.274 --> 01:58.498
She burnt way more hair than I did.
And I burnt some hair.

01:59.899 --> 02:02.102
Now I have to read
about her living the glamourous life

02:02.103 --> 02:03.615
and rubbing elbows with celebrities.

02:03.616 --> 02:05.292
That should be me.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.641
You cut my hair, I'm on TV.

02:06.642 --> 02:09.007
No offense,
but you're only slightly more famous

02:09.008 --> 02:11.247
than my client who shot her husband.

02:12.748 --> 02:14.799
Hello, giant plate of sandwiches !

02:16.600 --> 02:19.866
- Joey, listen...
- Hey, Michael ! Didn't even see you there.

02:20.967 --> 02:23.254
Hands off !
These are for my book club tonight.

02:23.955 --> 02:27.036
Book club here, in my own home ?

02:27.037 --> 02:30.378
God ! It's like I'm living
at the Playboy Mansion.

02:30.379 --> 02:33.235
Stay away from the sandwiches.
Watch him, mom.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.542
I can't believe this.

02:42.543 --> 02:46.043
It's so upsetting when people
with less talent than you are more successful.

02:46.044 --> 02:48.472
Yeah, like that dog from that beer commercial.

02:48.473 --> 02:51.756
Couldn't catch a Frisbee on cue.
Works all the time !

02:52.757 --> 02:54.895
You should ask your agent to hook me up.

02:54.896 --> 02:57.292
She has lots of famous clients
who need to get their hair done.

02:57.293 --> 02:58.281
Just show them my portfolio.

02:58.282 --> 02:59.945
I'm sure she will be impressed.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.666
I could show it to her
but i'm not so sure she will be impressed.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.874
All the hairstyles
are modelled by Michael...

03:04.875 --> 03:06.605
even the women's.

03:06.606 --> 03:07.812
- So  ?
- So...

03:07.813 --> 03:10.698
that Dorothy Hammel haircut
with the heavy make-up.

03:10.699 --> 03:13.099
We're lucky he's not burying bodies
in the backyard.

03:18.928 --> 03:20.825
Joey ! What are you doing here ?

03:21.526 --> 03:23.580
Why aren't you out there getting work ?

03:25.381 --> 03:26.816
Didn't have any auditions today.

03:26.817 --> 03:28.138
Sure !

03:28.139 --> 03:29.723
Put it all on me !

03:31.024 --> 03:32.315
What's that ?

03:32.316 --> 03:34.162
It's a portfolio of hairstyles.

03:34.663 --> 03:39.395
What ?

03:39.396 --> 03:40.880
Who's the model ?

03:45.181 --> 03:48.261
I'd like to keep
that little piece of chicken in my pocket

03:48.262 --> 03:49.902
and snack on him all day !

03:52.603 --> 03:53.988
That's my nephew.

03:53.989 --> 03:56.129
We can see who has the looks in your family.

03:58.830 --> 03:59.630
Anyway...

03:59.631 --> 04:02.271
my sister is a hairdresser
and that's her portfolio.

04:02.972 --> 04:04.595
I was hoping maybe you could

04:04.596 --> 04:06.417
show it to some of your clients.

04:07.118 --> 04:08.321
Absolutely !

04:13.822 --> 04:15.543
Hi, Halle Berry.

04:16.744 --> 04:18.784
My client has a sister who's a barber.

04:21.685 --> 04:23.801
Could she do your hair for the Oscars ?

04:27.202 --> 04:28.855
What did she say ?

04:30.356 --> 04:32.662
Joey ! I'm not here
to do your personal favors.

04:33.763 --> 04:35.863
Let me explain how this agent thing works.

04:36.354 --> 04:38.143
First, you become famous.

04:39.144 --> 04:40.865
And then I'll kiss your ass.

04:43.466 --> 04:45.996
But until then, le'ts keep it
strictly professional.

04:47.597 --> 04:49.403
Okay, sorry. I understand.

04:49.404 --> 04:51.204
Leave the pictures of the boy toy.

05:00.273 --> 05:01.684
Well, hello !

05:01.985 --> 05:03.568
Are you here for book club ?

05:03.569 --> 05:04.831
I am now !

05:06.332 --> 05:08.665
What did you think of this week's book ?

05:08.666 --> 05:10.539
I found it extremely fictional.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.529
Joey ! Joey !

05:14.530 --> 05:16.414
Can i just talk to you for one second ?

05:16.414 --> 05:17.442
Yeah.

05:17.443 --> 05:18.710
Sorry.

05:21.011 --> 05:21.986
What are you doing ?

05:21.987 --> 05:25.119
You didn't tell me there were pretty ladies
in the nerd club.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.816
You gotta let me in.

05:26.817 --> 05:29.050
- Look, I don't know.
- Come on, Michael  !

05:29.051 --> 05:31.025
You can't keep me out of a room full of women.

05:31.026 --> 05:34.365
If  I was in charge of a room full of...
boring stuff. I'd let you in.

05:34.366 --> 05:36.089
Look, this isn't one of those book clubs

05:36.089 --> 05:38.036
where people just come to mingle, right  ?

05:38.037 --> 05:40.588
It's a place to discuss litterature
not pick up girls.

05:41.289 --> 05:43.165
Oh my god ! Jane's here ! Jane...

05:44.332 --> 05:45.563
Hi  Michael !

05:45.564 --> 05:46.720
I brought an icecream cake.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.696
It's great ! It's great. It's great to see you.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.525
Great book ! So great !

05:50.526 --> 05:52.812
It was a little slow at the beginning
but great overall.

05:52.813 --> 05:54.134
Did  you think it was great ?

05:54.135 --> 05:56.321
The cake is cold.
My hands are getting numb.

06:02.322 --> 06:04.205
Not a place to pick up girls ?

06:05.006 --> 06:07.310
What ? Jane ? No !
Are you kidding ? No, never.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.626
Great ! Great. Great  ! Great...

06:12.927 --> 06:14.203
All right !

06:14.804 --> 06:16.524
I love her so much !

06:17.725 --> 06:19.111
So ask her out !

06:19.112 --> 06:21.216
No, book club has a strict no dating rules.

06:21.217 --> 06:22.114
And I'm the president.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.175
She's my vice-president.

06:23.176 --> 06:25.458
The scandal would tear
our administration apart.

06:26.259 --> 06:28.408
Michael, you have to seize this moment.

06:29.409 --> 06:33.963
The love between two nerds
is a rare and fragile thing.

06:33.964 --> 06:34.865
I want to !

06:34.866 --> 06:37.559
I can't go against the rules
without a motion being passed.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.947
So I'll make a motion.

06:38.948 --> 06:40.952
You're not a member.
There's an approuval process.

06:40.953 --> 06:42.958
Well, I motion you suspend it
on account of me

06:42.959 --> 06:46.792
being the sole payer of rent
of the whole book club's headquarters.

06:46.793 --> 06:49.090
I second the motion. The motion's passed.

06:49.391 --> 06:51.948
I motion for a presidential exemption
to the "no dating" rule.

06:51.949 --> 06:53.958
I second the motion. The motion's passed.

06:53.959 --> 06:57.902
I motion that you and me eat
that entire icecream cake right now.

06:57.903 --> 06:59.097
Motion denied.

06:59.098 --> 07:00.798
M. chairman, you're out of order.

07:06.252 --> 07:07.932
Great book club tonight.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.467
Lively discussions
and I've got 5 phone numbers.

07:12.168 --> 07:14.003
The girls are crazy about you.

07:14.204 --> 07:15.330
What's your secret ?

07:15.331 --> 07:16.637
There's no trick.

07:16.638 --> 07:18.516
Women just wanna be listened to.

07:18.517 --> 07:21.087
So when they talk,
I pretend to listen and go like this...

07:25.088 --> 07:27.058
So, how did it go with Jane ?
Did you ask her out ?

07:27.051 --> 07:29.230
No. Just 'cause I wanna wait
'till next wek's meeting

07:29.239 --> 07:30.675
so I can set the move.

07:30.977 --> 07:32.514
So I picked a romantic book and

07:32.514 --> 07:34.271
I asked her to come over right before

07:34.272 --> 07:36.440
just to help me write out
the discussion questions.

07:36.441 --> 07:38.273
Nice, nice. What's the book ?

07:38.674 --> 07:40.135
Jane Austin's <i> Pride And Prejudice. </i> 

07:40.135 --> 07:44.154
It's a tale of manners and courtships
at 19th century royal England.

07:44.155 --> 07:45.834
I hope you enjoy reading that.

07:45.835 --> 07:46.993
Joey !

07:46.994 --> 07:49.771
If you're gonna be in this book club,
you have to read the book.

07:49.772 --> 07:51.670
The whole notion of... Stop that !

07:53.871 --> 07:55.072
Stop it !

07:56.563 --> 07:58.506
- Hey, guys !
- Hey, ma !

07:58.507 --> 08:00.806
So is your agent gonna send me any clients  ?

08:00.807 --> 08:01.638
No.

08:01.639 --> 08:03.450
Actually Bobby has been really busy

08:03.451 --> 08:05.063
so I don't know if you shoud expect a call.

08:05.064 --> 08:06.707
Your agent ? She did call.

08:06.708 --> 08:07.571
Really ?

08:07.572 --> 08:09.903
Yeah, it was weird.
She called me her litlle chicken nugget

08:09.904 --> 08:12.044
then made a bunch of slurping noises.

08:14.045 --> 08:15.694
That's just showbiz talks.

08:17.095 --> 08:19.167
Can't believe you don't know anyone famous !

08:19.168 --> 08:20.849
If you hadn't turned down that hit show,

08:20.849 --> 08:23.339
you'd have so many connections
that could help me right now.

08:23.340 --> 08:25.758
Yeah, that's what I regret most
about that decision.

08:27.759 --> 08:29.082
I'm sorry to bug you but

08:29.082 --> 08:30.693
did you get some of my mail by mistake  ?

08:30.694 --> 08:31.942
I didn't my People Magasine.

08:31.943 --> 08:34.298
And the post office said
they delivered it today.

08:37.298 --> 08:39.071
Gina, weren't you reading that earlier ?

08:39.072 --> 08:42.231
What's the problem I'm not good enough
to steal your magasine ?

08:43.232 --> 08:45.864
That's okay. I think it's upstairs.
Have a sit. I'll go get it.

08:45.865 --> 08:48.714
No, that's okay.
You don't have to leave us alone.

08:50.115 --> 08:52.446
- So, tell me. Do you...
- This isn't a social hour.

08:52.447 --> 08:54.479
What famous people do you know ?

08:55.980 --> 08:57.258
Well...

08:57.759 --> 09:00.804
my college friend Jessica is married
a big time movie producer.

09:00.805 --> 09:03.559
Does she wear really expensive gowns
and get her hair all the time up

09:03.560 --> 09:04.748
and go to big premieres ?

09:04.749 --> 09:07.487
Yeah, all the time.
She goes to one like every week.

09:08.188 --> 09:10.005
You're lying to impress me.

09:11.006 --> 09:12.127
No, I'm not lying.

09:12.128 --> 09:13.778
She's a really good friend of mine.

09:13.779 --> 09:14.477
Yeah, right !

09:14.478 --> 09:17.296
I'd like to see you ask her to let me do
her hair for her next premiere.

09:17.297 --> 09:18.617
All right, I will !

09:18.618 --> 09:20.405
Wait ! What just happened ?

09:21.306 --> 09:22.298
I'm really good, I swear !

09:22.299 --> 09:23.584
I just need a chance.

09:23.585 --> 09:24.923
If you call her and set it up,

09:24.924 --> 09:26.518
I'll be nice to you.

09:27.519 --> 09:29.040
For how long ?

09:30.241 --> 09:31.941
- Name your terms
- Two weeks.

09:31.942 --> 09:33.718
- Done.
- I should have said three.

09:33.719 --> 09:35.419
And now you're down to one.

09:42.479 --> 09:44.224
- Hey !
- Hello !

09:44.225 --> 09:45.445
Listen, tonight at book club,

09:45.446 --> 09:47.283
don't have Diane seat next to Maureen.

09:47.284 --> 09:48.185
Why ?

09:48.186 --> 09:50.300
I may be dating both of them exclusively.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.196
Oh my god ! That's Jane !

09:54.197 --> 09:56.133
Alright, I'll get out of here
until book club starts.

09:56.134 --> 09:57.787
I'll be in my room reading the book.

09:57.788 --> 10:00.067
And listen to some soft rock hit
of the 70s.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.346
Can you believe someone threw this out ?

10:02.347 --> 10:03.551
No...

10:07.222 --> 10:08.415
Hi.

10:08.416 --> 10:10.629
Wow ! Come in. I'm sorry. You look great.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.695
Thanks ! You look...

10:14.296 --> 10:16.962
I don't know.
I can't see without my glasses.

10:17.963 --> 10:20.260
I probably shouldn't have driven here.

10:22.561 --> 10:23.765
So...

10:25.516 --> 10:27.067
Did you enjoy the book ?

10:27.068 --> 10:28.321
Oh yeah !

10:28.322 --> 10:29.876
It's pretty romantic.

10:30.677 --> 10:31.748
Very.

10:32.649 --> 10:35.519
- So I wanted to ask you...
- Don't mind me. Just grabbing a snack.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.214
Reading makes me hungry !

10:38.815 --> 10:40.128
Sorry...

10:41.128 --> 10:42.710
Just call me angel...

10:52.711 --> 10:55.432
So  I was..
I was just thinking that maybe we could

10:55.433 --> 10:57.274
loosen up thye rules of the book club.

10:57.275 --> 10:58.238
Oh, okay.

10:58.239 --> 10:59.984
Like...  maybe we could

10:59.985 --> 11:02.152
strike the "no-dating" rules
from the by laws.

11:02.153 --> 11:04.159
- Oh yes ! Let's do that !
- Okay ! Okay !

11:04.160 --> 11:05.055
Consider it stroken.

11:05.056 --> 11:06.279
Okay, great !

11:06.480 --> 11:07.969
So we can date people on book club ?

11:07.970 --> 11:09.338
Yes, we can.

11:09.739 --> 11:11.616
So what's up with your uncle ?

11:11.617 --> 11:12.817
I'm sorry.

11:14.228 --> 11:15.777
Do you think he would go out with me ?

11:15.778 --> 11:17.230
He mentionned he was single last time.

11:17.231 --> 11:19.203
And I was hoping you would say
something for me.

11:19.204 --> 11:21.070
I'm gonna read in the courtyard.

11:21.371 --> 11:23.191
Give you two some privacy.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.927
4 down, 371 to go.

11:36.928 --> 11:38.407
- Hey !
- Hey.

11:38.408 --> 11:40.508
Just wanted to tell you guys
to be sure to watch TV tonight.

11:40.509 --> 11:42.251
I just did Alex's friend's hair
or the premiere

11:42.252 --> 11:44.098
and she's gonna be on the red carpet.

11:44.099 --> 11:45.606
How did it go ?

11:45.607 --> 11:47.029
I was a little nervous at first.

11:47.030 --> 11:48.562
She's a very fancy lady.

11:49.163 --> 11:52.515
She was drinking martinis
and sitting with her legs crossed.

11:53.516 --> 11:55.926
But then I got into it
and instinct just took over.

11:55.927 --> 11:59.429
I did this beautiful old
Hollywood style updo.

11:59.430 --> 12:00.672
Congratulations.

12:01.173 --> 12:01.954
I gotta go tell, Michael.

12:01.955 --> 12:02.883
No, no, no !

12:02.884 --> 12:04.678
He's in there with a girl.

12:04.879 --> 12:06.391
He's in there with a girl
and you're reading a book...

12:06.392 --> 12:08.131
What is this... <i> Freaky Friday </i>  ?

12:09.832 --> 12:11.739
Alright.
I guess I'll go tell Blondie how it went.

12:11.740 --> 12:14.166
Call her Alex.
You promised you were gonna be nice.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.059
Only one more day of that
and some stuff is gonna happen.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.187
Five minutes left...
I gotta buckle down !

12:23.188 --> 12:24.847
Hey, little snail !

12:28.848 --> 12:30.069
Hi, Joey !

12:31.470 --> 12:33.777
Diane, Maureen ! You two know each other ?

12:33.778 --> 12:35.521
Oh yeah ! We're good friends.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.284
I did not know that !

12:37.914 --> 12:39.323
Come on in !

12:41.524 --> 12:43.010
Hi, Joey !

12:43.011 --> 12:44.260
What's up !

12:46.033 --> 12:49.016
Listen, Michael, I didn't exactly
finish the book, okay ?

12:49.017 --> 12:50.303
So don't call on me.

12:50.304 --> 12:51.560
You're unbelievable.

12:51.561 --> 12:53.190
- What ?
- Come on.

12:56.591 --> 12:58.333
What's the matter ? Did you ask Jane out ?

12:58.334 --> 13:00.491
No, because she wants to go out with you.

13:01.592 --> 13:03.200
Dude, I'm so sorry.

13:03.401 --> 13:06.249
- Obviously, I would never...
- You totally screwed this up for me.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.311
I didn't mean to.

13:07.312 --> 13:08.632
I barely said two words to her.

13:08.633 --> 13:09.797
You didn't have to.

13:09.798 --> 13:11.673
You came to last week's meeting
with your game face on.

13:11.674 --> 13:12.565
Looking to score.

13:12.566 --> 13:13.372
And it worked.

13:13.373 --> 13:15.216
You're like a big blob of sex.

13:15.717 --> 13:18.609
And you use your charm
all over the girl I like.

13:19.110 --> 13:20.915
I am not a sex blob !

13:22.416 --> 13:23.710
Okay ? And this is not my fault.

13:23.711 --> 13:26.450
I'm sorry if she likes me
but I didn't do anything wrong.

13:26.451 --> 13:28.415
I should never have let you in.

13:31.116 --> 13:32.013
Should we get started  ?

13:32.014 --> 13:35.061
Yes ! Come, Joey ! Let's go talk
about the book we all read.

13:35.062 --> 13:36.736
Nothing past page 4  !

13:48.737 --> 13:51.234
Hey  ! I wanted to call
and tell you what a great...

13:51.235 --> 13:53.998
Book clud is starting,
everybody ! Book club !

13:54.999 --> 13:57.103
Okay. So... who wants to start ?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.002
I thought...

13:58.003 --> 14:01.416
Joey, what did you think
of <i> Pride and Prejudice </i>  ?

14:01.417 --> 14:02.089
Let's hear it.

14:02.090 --> 14:04.213
What were some of the central themes ?

14:10.214 --> 14:13.129
- Well, pride was one.
- Yeah.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.057
And of course prejudice which is wrong.

14:20.558 --> 14:21.958
And what did you think of Darcy  ?

14:21.959 --> 14:22.984
She was good.

14:22.985 --> 14:24.487
Darcy's a man.

14:24.888 --> 14:26.774
But not in the modern sense.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.512
Is that what you're saying, Joey ?

14:29.713 --> 14:31.859
Yes, it is. Yes, it is, Maureen.
Thank you.

14:34.860 --> 14:35.915
It's interesting.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.620
It's very interesting.

14:40.621 --> 14:41.807
He didn't read the book !

14:41.808 --> 14:43.909
The only reason he's here
is to pick up women.

14:43.910 --> 14:46.424
Now, in the interest of maintaining
the integrity of book club,

14:46.425 --> 14:48.791
I motion that we kick Joey out.
Who seconds ?

14:51.792 --> 14:53.407
Come on ! He didn't read the book.

14:53.408 --> 14:54.794
Neither did I.

14:54.795 --> 14:55.527
Me neither.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.468
I saw the movie.

14:56.469 --> 14:57.890
There was a movie !

15:00.591 --> 15:02.172
Did anyone here read the book ?

15:02.173 --> 15:03.981
You put too much pressure on us, Michael ?

15:03.982 --> 15:05.238
A book a week ?

15:05.239 --> 15:07.015
It's just gotten really stressful.

15:07.016 --> 15:08.815
How is reading stressful ?

15:09.316 --> 15:11.021
Reading is fun !

15:11.222 --> 15:12.412
It's fun !

15:12.413 --> 15:13.570
Okay !

15:13.971 --> 15:16.459
Okay ! Let's not turn
this into a hostage situation !

15:18.160 --> 15:19.443
If you want me to leave, I will.

15:19.444 --> 15:20.674
No !

15:21.675 --> 15:23.375
You know what ? I'm just gonna go.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.658
Okay. It's almost time
for the big premiere. I made pop-corn.

15:35.159 --> 15:36.273
Nice place.

15:37.095 --> 15:38.953
Who's the knock-out with the tiara ?

15:38.954 --> 15:40.389
That's my sister Nancy.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.210
She was Queen of the Rose Parade.

15:43.011 --> 15:47.030
You're cute but maybe you shouldn't stand
next to her in family pictures.

15:47.331 --> 15:50.348
Yeah. That's what my mom says.

15:51.749 --> 15:53.497
I really appreciate you helping me out.

15:53.498 --> 15:55.372
I know I mess with you sometimes but

15:55.373 --> 15:56.465
it's just for fun.

15:56.466 --> 15:58.219
Oh yeah ! that is fun.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.660
So this is actually kind of nice.

16:03.661 --> 16:05.292
Being friendly.

16:05.293 --> 16:07.918
Maybe we could keep it up
a little longer than a week.

16:07.919 --> 16:09.310
I phisically can't.

16:10.611 --> 16:12.194
Oh my god, it's on !

16:13.995 --> 16:16.899
George Clooney...
I would wear him down to a knob.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.360
Yeah. I would...
have bunches of sex with him.

16:24.361 --> 16:26.328
Oh my god ! I think that's Jessica's husband
getting out of the limo.

16:26.329 --> 16:27.776
Oh my god ! This is exciting.

16:27.777 --> 16:29.039
There she is !

16:29.040 --> 16:31.029
Wow ! She actually looks very good !

16:32.630 --> 16:34.207
Not that I'm surprised.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.445
I mean when I said actually,
I didn't mean...

16:37.146 --> 16:38.860
What ? What's wrong ?

16:40.061 --> 16:41.883
She took it down.

16:41.884 --> 16:43.133
What ?

16:43.134 --> 16:44.680
That wasn't the style I gave her.

16:44.681 --> 16:46.704
She must have taken it out in the limo.

16:47.105 --> 16:48.307
She hated it.

16:50.508 --> 16:52.001
I can't believe this.

16:52.902 --> 16:54.226
I'm so sorry.

16:55.827 --> 16:57.870
I knew when I walked in there
I was out of my league.

16:57.871 --> 17:01.432
But I spent two hours trying to fake it.

17:01.433 --> 17:02.558
Oh no !

17:03.859 --> 17:05.102
There ! There !

17:07.103 --> 17:09.464
I can't believe I ever thought
I could do this.

17:09.464 --> 17:12.021
I just don't fit in with rich people.
They look down on me.

17:12.022 --> 17:13.681
They always have and they'll always will.

17:13.682 --> 17:15.707
With their grammar and their leg-crossing.

17:18.877 --> 17:20.902
Hey ! Don't be saying that, girfriend !

17:25.502 --> 17:28.693
Okay,  look. I grew up with money
and I don't look down on you.

17:29.494 --> 17:31.458
If anything, I envy you.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.393
Come on !

17:32.394 --> 17:33.585
It's true !

17:33.586 --> 17:35.914
I wish I were as strong
and as confident as you.

17:36.915 --> 17:40.419
And if it were me, I'd be more than happy
to have you do my hair.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.497
Really ?

17:43.498 --> 17:44.393
You mean that ?

17:44.394 --> 17:45.680
Absolutely !

17:47.181 --> 17:48.890
So can we do it right now ?

17:49.891 --> 17:51.137
Now ?

17:51.538 --> 17:52.781
Now seems so soon.

17:57.782 --> 18:00.045
Look, Micheal. It's Joey.
I know you're mad.

18:01.746 --> 18:02.768
Hope you come home soon

18:02.769 --> 18:05.873
so we can talk about how you're feelin
and worked this out.

18:06.174 --> 18:07.364
And also if you get a chance

18:07.365 --> 18:10.164
to pick up some tacos
or something on your way home,

18:11.165 --> 18:12.474
that'd be great.

18:17.865 --> 18:19.047
Hey.

18:19.448 --> 18:20.625
Look...

18:21.126 --> 18:23.780
I know you're upset
because Jane liked me. Alright ?

18:24.781 --> 18:27.899
But I hope you know I wouldn't never
come between you and a girl.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.578
And I really did not mean for that to happen.

18:31.079 --> 18:32.425
I know you didn't.

18:34.426 --> 18:35.793
That's the problem.

18:38.294 --> 18:39.496
What ?

18:40.367 --> 18:42.399
It's gonna happen wether you try or not.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.287
Anytime I actually get a girl
and bring her home,

18:45.688 --> 18:48.186
she'll take one look at you
and she'll forget I'm even here.

18:48.187 --> 18:50.208
Come on ! Give yourself some credit.

18:50.909 --> 18:52.950
You have so many gifts that I don't have.

18:54.151 --> 18:55.945
You're really smart.

18:56.646 --> 18:58.816
People respect your opinion about stuff.

18:58.817 --> 19:00.547
That's a great thing.

19:01.148 --> 19:02.424
Maybe...

19:02.925 --> 19:04.753
I'd still rather have your gifts.

19:06.754 --> 19:07.963
Yeah, me too.

19:11.144 --> 19:13.161
You are on your way to big things.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.799
'Cause you're only gonna get better

19:16.800 --> 19:18.412
with girls and stuff.

19:18.413 --> 19:20.268
but I'll always suck at maths.

19:21.819 --> 19:25.351
In like 5 years, you are gonna be a force
to be reckon with.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.003
Yeah.

19:29.324 --> 19:30.728
And in 5 years...

19:31.129 --> 19:32.536
You'll be 40.

19:37.147 --> 19:39.360
You've a lot of your mother in you,
don't you ?

19:42.261 --> 19:44.007
Okay... ladies and gentlemen...

19:44.008 --> 19:46.761
modelling an original Gina Tribbiani hairstyle

19:46.762 --> 19:48.717
called "the nice and nasty"...

19:51.058 --> 19:52.813
I give you Alex Garrett  !

19:56.214 --> 19:57.751
Now that's a neighbour !

19:59.552 --> 20:00.319
Come on !

20:00.320 --> 20:01.997
Get your camera.
I wanna take some pictures !

20:01.998 --> 20:03.286
You look so different !

20:03.287 --> 20:05.418
I can't believe you own
an outfit that slutty !

20:05.419 --> 20:07.524
Hey ! That's mine ! I wear that to church.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.390
You're very nice to be such a good sport.

20:13.391 --> 20:15.004
Can I tell you something ?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.525
I love it !

20:17.526 --> 20:19.749
I feel like Julia Roberts in <i> Pretty Woman.</i> 

20:21.750 --> 20:23.589
You know she was a hooker, right ?

20:24.790 --> 20:27.022
I have to go look at myself
in the miror again !

20:33.423 --> 20:35.258
An all new <i> Will & Grace </i> is coming up next !

20:35.259 --> 20:36.891
Right here on NBC.

20:39.592 --> 20:41.293
Joey, I've got great news !

20:41.664 --> 20:42.854
Did I get that commercial ?

20:42.855 --> 20:44.414
No ! I bought a horse !

20:47.015 --> 20:48.533
Joey ! I gotta get to school !

20:49.834 --> 20:51.396
Oh... Hi ! i'm Michael.

20:54.047 --> 20:55.387
Have a sit !

20:57.288 --> 20:58.479
Joey !

20:58.480 --> 21:00.079
I completely forgot.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.821
There's a residual check for you
in the accounting department.

21:04.022 --> 21:05.765
Why don't you go grab it ?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.129
Alright ! Okay, I'll be right back.

21:19.030 --> 21:20.481
So. Michael...

21:21.782 --> 21:23.849
How do you feel about full frontal nudity ?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.533
I'm not an actor.

21:28.534 --> 21:30.205
Oh, yes, I know.
