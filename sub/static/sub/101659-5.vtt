Is the pain
a tight band

do you get
these symptoms?

all these tests
with her.

gonna give me stuff to
lower my blood pressure.

before she was born.

option is to
put in a drain

some pressure,

then basically watch
to see if the swelling
goes down.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.399
And the more invasive?

06:05.533 --> 06:06.299
Surgical removal.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.969
But the cyst
is deep inside

06:09.102 --> 06:11.338
and wrapped around
major arteries,

06:11.472 --> 06:14.842
so it is more likely
to fix the problem,

12:23.143 --> 12:24.177
Ellie, do you know
where you are?

12:25.045 --> 12:25.913
Why am I
in the hospital?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.047
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

12:36.456 --> 12:38.892
SHAUN: Suprarenal
aortic aneurysm.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.194
It ruptured
as he was
being discharged.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.529
Clamping aorta now.

12:42.662 --> 12:43.596
How much blood
is he down?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.232
We suctioned out
two liters

12:45.365 --> 12:47.801
and gave six units
on the rapid infuser.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.937
SHAUN: The aneurysm
caused his back pain.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.204
Dr. Wolke
missed it.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.741
I did
an abdominal exam.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.743
Aneurysms are
very hard to catch.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.411
Experienced doctors
miss them
all the time.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.546
Potts scissors.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.883
The aneurysm
is 6.5 centimeters.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.452
Dr. Wolke
should have felt it.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.724
It felt like
normal musculature.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.060
I'm so sorry.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.761
We'll never know
what you felt.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.430
There's no way to know
if you, or any doctor,
for that matter,

13:17.564 --> 13:18.498
would have
detected this.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.734
I would have.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.271
He asked me
if I wanted to
double-check.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.506
If I had, I would've
caught the aneurysm
before the rupture.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.640
Stop it.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.812
He made a mistake.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.581
He might have.

13:34.714 --> 13:35.883
But you did, too.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.451
No. You told me
to back off.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.253
I didn't tell you to
abdicate responsibility.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.129
When a First Year
asks if you want to
re-check their work,

13:49.262 --> 13:51.264
your answer should
always be "yes."

13:54.134 --> 13:56.136
The fact
they're asking
is a warning sign.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.174
I didn't know that.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.019
It's called
retrograde
memory loss.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.653
Luckily, it seems
to have been
temporary.

14:13.786 --> 14:14.521
She's lucid again.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.892
We're running
an MRI
and lab tests

14:19.026 --> 14:20.627
to see
what caused it.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.130
Thank you
for, uh, telling me.
I know I'm just the...

14:24.764 --> 14:25.498
You care.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.439
Maybe things with
Ellie and I weren't
always perfect, but...

14:32.572 --> 14:33.306
It was exciting.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.309
When I was
with her...

14:38.411 --> 14:40.113
Never felt
that way before.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.949
I took care of her
when she was sick.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.017
I never strayed.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.518
It wasn't about
the things we did.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.686
It was...
It was about

14:48.588 --> 14:49.356
being with her.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.327
She stuck by me
when I needed her.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.331
Last year, I was...
I was drinking
way too much.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.338
It's hard to imagine
being without her.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.840
I just can't imagine
being without her.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.951
She's stable.

everything I own

You've said a lot
of things twice.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.454

limited creativity.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.722
Truth is, it wasn't
creative at all.

Some of them
are actual

something

that helps

a real risk of
more memory loss.

permanently.

to the surgery.

at your jobs,

at a time.

separately.

to finish it last night

you will be focusing
on physical exams.

the seven post-op tests
to be conducted on Carl.

you will find
relevant seminars

I haven't gone
on many dates.

loves movies.

For bringing up
your personal life
the other day.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.000
No.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.702
You have nothing to
apologize to me for.

on your list?

of infection
inside your abdomen.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.649
Open your eyes
wider.

of jaundice.

your liver's failing.

How? A genetic
predisposition
or...

20:39.506 --> 20:41.207
More likely,
when we fixed
the first one,

20:41.341 --> 20:42.675
we increased
the pressure
upstream.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.345
Can we stent
the celiac?

20:45.478 --> 20:46.679
Anatomy's
too tricky.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.582
Aortic to
celiac bypass?

20:49.716 --> 20:52.452
We'd just risk
a new aneurysm
forming upstream.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.587
Maybe, but it solves
the problem
in front of us.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.423
He'll die without
an intervention.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.190
He'll probably die
either way.

21:03.229 --> 21:06.433
Let's all take
the time to research
alternate solutions.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.602
If we can't come up
with something better
in 24 hours,

21:09.736 --> 21:10.870
we proceed
with the bypass.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.923
She's saying no
for emotional reasons.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.061
So the answer
isn't medical.

21:35.194 --> 21:35.928
It's emotional.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.202
We think Zane
should talk to Ellie.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.704
No.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.573
I don't want him
anywhere near her.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.741
To convince her
to do
the craniotomy.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.745
From you,
it's self-serving.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.113
From Zane...

21:56.148 --> 21:57.484
Wait. If she doesn't
want it...

21:57.617 --> 21:59.786
You said
you can't imagine
life without her.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.591
If you meant that,
you'd risk anything
to keep her alive.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.259
Including
her memories
of you.

Did the videos help?

22:40.292 --> 22:41.293
Yes.

22:44.196 --> 22:44.964
Tell me more.

22:46.733 --> 22:50.102
One of my patients
developed
a secondary aneurysm.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.639
Now I need to find
a surgical fix
by tomorrow.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.240
Otherwise,
he will probably die.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.808
I brought Skittles.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.580
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

Yes. After you
go to bed,

I plan to
go back and
do research.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.821
Shaunie,
go to the hospital.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.823
No, we made
this schedule.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.026
Someone else needs you.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.563
More than I need you.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.900

with sick people.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.803
But tomorrow,
will someone need you

23:23.936 --> 23:25.204
to come up with a way
to save their life?

23:25.337 --> 23:27.106
Mmm, maybe.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.845
Probably
not tomorrow.

23:35.381 --> 23:36.148
Okay.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.085
Mmm-hmm.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.722
(SIGHS)

23:43.690 --> 23:47.026
I am canceling
date night.

23:47.794 --> 23:48.761
That's rude.

23:48.895 --> 23:49.862
Oh, well.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.371
Then

24:00.540 --> 24:01.641
I should

24:02.875 --> 24:03.943
go to the hospital.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.377
Mmm-hmm.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.888
They're prepping Ellie
for surgery.

questions?

What should I do?

24:29.035 --> 24:31.838
Under the right
circumstances,
every human will stray.

We're not hardwired
for monogamy.

24:34.941 --> 24:35.942
I'm guessing
you're not married.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.911
I'm not saying

with you.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.315
We could remove
more proximal aorta

25:16.448 --> 25:17.784

the graft.

Daniel Craig

26:50.276 --> 26:52.478

these were in your drawer,

26:52.611 --> 26:56.015
on top of
an instruction manual
for a 2019 cellphone,

26:56.148 --> 26:58.250

you dug them out
within the last year.

you are currently

You've been sleeping
with an ex

27:08.260 --> 27:09.628
without asking
for any commitment.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.698
It's just sex.
It's not keeping me
from anything.

to prevent someone
from moving on?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.703

or an ex in your bed?

27:16.836 --> 27:19.471
I'm at least
getting something hot
from the situation.

27:19.605 --> 27:20.907

damaged from
the aneurysm

27:40.960 --> 27:42.261
right where
it branches off.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.297
We're gonna find
a vein in your leg
that's similar in size,

27:45.431 --> 27:48.267

and use it to replace
the damaged artery.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.135

27:50.302 --> 27:51.503

an excellent solution.
