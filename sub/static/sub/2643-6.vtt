- Problem?
- This is the worst cobbler I've eaten.

00:11.284 --> 00:15.380
It tastes like it's made of actual
ground-up shoe maker.

00:15.555 --> 00:19.047
Amusing.

Hey, guys. Guess who I found at LAX:
My baby sister Priya.

00:25.598 --> 00:27.589
Excuse me, I object.

00:27.767 --> 00:31.794
You propose a guessing game,
yet you don't give me time to guess.

00:32.806 --> 00:35.639
For the record,
I was going to say, "Your sister Priya."

00:36.609 --> 00:39.271
Oh, Sheldon, you haven't
changed a bit, have you?

00:39.813 --> 00:41.405
Why would I change?

00:41.581 --> 00:44.709
The hope has been that you'd
eventually bend to public opinion.

00:45.985 --> 00:47.782
So, what brings you back to L. A?

00:47.954 --> 00:50.013
I have a layover on my way to Toronto.

00:50.223 --> 00:52.020
- Corporate merger.
- Can you believe it?

00:52.225 --> 00:55.194
Priya is a lead attorney
for the biggest car company in India.

00:55.361 --> 00:58.330
Given that when we met her,
she was finishing law school...

00:58.498 --> 01:01.490
...and planning an internship
at a large Indian car company...

01:01.668 --> 01:03.533
...it's actually extremely plausible.

01:04.104 --> 01:06.868
And your poll numbers

01:07.440 --> 01:10.967
I want to catch up with all of you,

She's covered with airplane germs.

01:38.838 --> 01:41.966
Okay, forget who's hotter.
The first time Priya came to L. A...

01:42.142 --> 01:46.135
...Leonard and I made a pact out of
respect to our friendship and to you...

02:54.113 --> 02:55.444
"Train day"?

02:55.615 --> 02:58.516
The fun starts with brunch
at Carney's in Studio City...

02:58.685 --> 03:01.848
...a hot dog stand
in a converted railroad dining car.

03:02.055 --> 03:03.955
Next stop, Travel Town...

03:04.123 --> 03:07.684
...an outdoor museum
featuring 43 railroad engines, cars...

03:07.860 --> 03:10.920
...and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

Then finally, we're off to the glitz

...for dinner at, that's right,
the Hollywood Carney's...

Well, I guess that's not unusual.

03:45.865 --> 03:50.063
Did you make it clear it's two different
train cars turned into hot dog stands?

03:50.236 --> 03:51.828
Abundantly.

03:52.005 --> 03:53.700
I guess he just hates fun.

03:54.674 --> 03:57.006
That's what I said.

Do you like trains?

04:22.235 --> 04:24.066
Not particularly.

Well, so much for that.

- I found an emulator online...

11:52.218 --> 11:53.412
Like what?

11:53.586 --> 11:57.886
Like, "Has Leonard betrayed
any of his friends recently?"

11:58.057 --> 12:01.788
Priya and I are both adults.
I didn't betray Raj.

12:01.961 --> 12:05.294
In fact, you did.
But I was referring to Howard.

12:05.464 --> 12:08.262
- What are you talking about?
- April 12, 2005.

12:08.434 --> 12:10.402
Bob's Big Boy, Toluca Lake.

12:10.569 --> 12:14.061
Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time...

12:14.240 --> 12:17.334
...and she was enjoying
the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion...

12:17.510 --> 12:19.944
...in the form of
a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger.

12:20.446 --> 12:22.346
In order to preserve your friendship...

12:22.515 --> 12:24.415
...you and Howard
made a pinkie swear...

12:24.583 --> 12:26.016
...that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

12:26.185 --> 12:27.209
<font color="#E86CE4">(SIGHS)</font>

12:27.520 --> 12:29.715
I had a patty melt.

12:30.122 --> 12:31.851
Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.

12:32.024 --> 12:33.787
- And Raj.
- All right. And Raj.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.426
And me.

12:36.095 --> 12:37.119
You?

12:37.296 --> 12:41.198
Violation of the Roommate Agreement's
overnight guest notification clause.

12:41.367 --> 12:46.168
Okay, fine. I'm a horrible human being.
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

12:46.338 --> 12:48.670
You're far too short to be Darth Vader.

12:49.975 --> 12:52.671
At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.

12:53.112 --> 12:55.103
My point is Priya's gone...

12:55.281 --> 12:58.614
...and it would be much better
if no one else found out about us.

13:00.019 --> 13:02.544
- You want me to keep a secret?
- Yes.

13:02.755 --> 13:04.347
You know I can't keep a secret.

13:04.523 --> 13:06.684
You can if you try.
Think about it this way:

13:06.859 --> 13:11.489
Um, if I were Batman and you were Alfred,
you'd keep that secret, right?

13:12.198 --> 13:14.291
Why do you get to be Batman?

13:14.466 --> 13:16.400
Because, uh, Batman has the secret.

13:16.569 --> 13:18.867
- Well, Alfred has secrets too.
- Like what?

13:19.038 --> 13:21.905
Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl.

13:22.074 --> 13:25.771
Which I've now just told to Batman.
See, I cannot keep a secret.

13:29.548 --> 13:31.345
Ta-da!

13:31.584 --> 13:32.778
What?

13:32.952 --> 13:33.976
Ta-da.

13:34.687 --> 13:35.711
It's short for:

13:35.888 --> 13:37.219
<font color="#E86CE4">(SINGSONG)</font>
Da-da-ta-da.

13:38.524 --> 13:40.151
I'm kind of busy here, Sheldon.

13:40.326 --> 13:42.556
I know, that's why I shortened it.

13:43.996 --> 13:45.088
What do you want?

13:45.297 --> 13:48.755
I came to go over your alibi
for last night.

13:48.934 --> 13:50.492
What alibi?

13:50.669 --> 13:53.502
You've asked me to lie on your behalf,
and as you know...

13:53.672 --> 13:56.368
...I’m deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty.

13:56.542 --> 13:59.943
So I've provided you
with an ironclad alibi.

14:00.112 --> 14:02.512
You couldn't have spent last night
with Priya...

14:02.681 --> 14:04.512
...because you were with
another woman.

14:04.683 --> 14:09.916
Oh, I'm so sure I'm gonna regret this,
but who was I with?

14:10.089 --> 14:13.957
The fun-loving and morally loose
Miss Maggie McGarry.

14:14.126 --> 14:15.457
Oh, God.

14:15.628 --> 14:19.724
You met her at Pasadena's most popular
Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin's...

14:19.899 --> 14:22.265
...where Maggie spends her nights
tending bar...

14:22.434 --> 14:25.232
...with a head full of curls
and a heart full of dreams.

14:25.404 --> 14:29.101
"Leonard, call me
if you're interested in coitus.

14:30.609 --> 14:32.907
Sincerely, Maggie McGarry."

14:33.078 --> 14:39.313
And if anyone were to actually call
that number, they will hear this:

14:39.485 --> 14:42.113
ROBOTIC VOICE <font color="#E86CE4">(ON RECORDING)</font>:
Top of the morning to you.

14:42.288 --> 14:43.915
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

14:45.124 --> 14:48.525
Leave a message
after the wee little beep.

14:48.694 --> 14:49.718
<font color="#E86CE4">(BEEPS)</font>

14:49.895 --> 14:53.422
It's pretty convincing, huh?
That wasn't even a real person.

14:53.599 --> 14:55.567
And here is the clincher.

14:55.734 --> 15:00.296
A lock of Maggie's
flaming auburn hair.

15:00.806 --> 15:04.401
- Where'd you get that?
- From an orangutan in the Primate Lab.

15:04.576 --> 15:05.600
An orangutan?

15:05.778 --> 15:08.611
Well, no one's going to run
a DNA test on it, Leonard.

15:08.781 --> 15:10.612
Honestly, you over-think everything.

15:10.783 --> 15:14.082
Look, Sheldon. Ugh, I don't need an alibi.

15:14.253 --> 15:17.984
Nobody's going to ask about last night
as long as you just zip your lip.

15:21.660 --> 15:24.959
Thank you. Now, don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

15:39.211 --> 15:40.439
- Hey.
- Hey, Leonard...

15:40.612 --> 15:42.876
...will you please tell Howard
my sister's never been attracted to him?

15:43.048 --> 15:44.072
<font color="#E86CE4">(SCOFFS)</font>

15:44.249 --> 15:48.481
Well, come on, Raj, how am I supposed
to know who she's attracted to?

15:48.654 --> 15:50.622
Or was attracted to?

15:50.789 --> 15:54.657
Or who she might be attracted to
in the future?

15:55.527 --> 15:59.361
And I have nothing to contribute
to this conversation...

16:01.300 --> 16:03.564
...because I, too, know
absolutely nothing...

16:03.736 --> 16:06.330
...about Priya's preferences
in male companionship.

16:07.206 --> 16:09.572
And with that, I will re-zip my lip.

16:10.776 --> 16:11.800
<font color="#E86CE4">(SCOFFS)</font>

16:12.177 --> 16:14.907
What did you guys think of
Caprica last night?

16:15.080 --> 16:18.311
- I didn't see it.
- Didn't see it? Heh, what were you doing?

16:22.488 --> 16:25.321
- L... I was out.
- What? On Caprica night?

16:25.491 --> 16:27.482
Yeah, uh, I went for a drink.

16:27.659 --> 16:31.527
Really? Heh, you? Where'd...?
Where'd you go?

16:31.697 --> 16:33.528
To, uh...

16:39.738 --> 16:41.603
...Lucky Baldwin's.

16:42.341 --> 16:45.538
Oh, I've heard of that place.

16:45.711 --> 16:49.306
Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

16:49.481 --> 16:50.505
<font color="#E86CE4">(SIGHS)</font>

16:50.682 --> 16:53.617
- Yes.
- Did you meet anyone interesting there?

16:53.786 --> 16:57.916
Perhaps a promiscuous
redheaded barmaid?

16:58.090 --> 17:01.355
Uh, as a matter of fact, l... l...
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

17:01.527 --> 17:04.496
Sure, you can. You're doing fine.
It's very believable.

17:05.396 --> 17:09.196
I'm sorry, Raj, but the truth is
I was with Priya last night.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.392
Don't listen to him.

17:10.569 --> 17:14.368
He's lightheaded from all the whiskey
and pickled eggs in his system.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.065
- What were you doing with Priya?
- I believe coitus.

17:17.242 --> 17:20.439
But more importantly, if Leonard
had not abandoned his story...

17:20.612 --> 17:22.477
...would you have found it plausible?

17:22.647 --> 17:25.617
- Did you...? You slept with my sister?
- Yeah.

17:25.784 --> 17:27.775
How could you? We had a pact.

17:27.953 --> 17:29.944
Excuse me, I think "She's my sister"...

17:30.122 --> 17:32.750
...takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinkie swear.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.753
May I point out in a parallel universe
your friends are saying:

17:36.929 --> 17:39.159
"Maggie McGarry?
She sounds lovely."

17:40.032 --> 17:42.728
Now, I admit it,
I may have crossed a line here.

17:42.901 --> 17:45.961
But come on, Raj.
Your sister is a grown woman.

17:46.138 --> 17:49.039
And to her,
I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.

17:50.476 --> 17:53.104
I don't believe it.
This is a betrayal of my trust.

17:53.278 --> 17:56.611
No, no, no. Would it help if I told you
that I offered her my heart...

17:56.782 --> 17:59.080
...and she kind of stomped on it?

17:59.918 --> 18:01.909
How hard did she stomp?

18:02.788 --> 18:03.812
Very hard.

18:05.157 --> 18:06.784
Okay, I'm good.

18:09.428 --> 18:13.762
Okay, well, Raj, I just wanna say
that I'd never betray your trust.

18:13.932 --> 18:16.264
Unlike Leonard, I respect you.

18:16.869 --> 18:18.632
- Really?
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Mm-hm.

18:19.972 --> 18:22.304
Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj...

18:22.474 --> 18:25.602
...about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

18:25.811 --> 18:28.780
Dude, I put that thing on my face.

18:28.947 --> 18:31.541
I think a more amusing violation
of Raj's trust...

18:31.717 --> 18:33.344
...is when Howard convinced him...

18:33.519 --> 18:35.919
...that foreigners give presents
to Americans on Thanksgiving.

18:38.357 --> 18:42.521
Hey, I didn't see you giving back
your Snoopy Sno-Cone maker.

18:42.694 --> 18:45.822
Wait, that was all a lie?
This year's gifts are already wrapped.

18:45.998 --> 18:47.363
As long as we're talking...

18:47.533 --> 18:50.730
...how about the month Sheldon spent
grinding up insects...

18:50.903 --> 18:52.734
...and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

18:52.905 --> 18:55.738
Well, excuse me.
That was not a betrayal.

18:55.908 --> 18:57.375
- Oh.
- That was an experiment...

18:57.543 --> 19:02.037
...to determine at what concentration
food starts tasting mothy.

19:02.881 --> 19:05.042
You put moths in my food?

19:06.351 --> 19:08.478
For science.

19:09.221 --> 19:11.485
I can't believe you kissed my sister
with moth mouth.

19:11.657 --> 19:15.718
Well, uh... I can't believe you'd use
Sheldon's toothbrush.

19:15.894 --> 19:18.089
You used my toothbrush?

19:18.263 --> 19:21.027
Not the brush part.
Just the little rubber thing...

19:21.200 --> 19:24.636
...to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

19:31.210 --> 19:33.178
Okay, l... I think it's safe to say...

19:33.345 --> 19:36.508
...that we've all done some things
we're not particularly proud of.

19:38.016 --> 19:40.007
But come on, we're friends.

19:40.185 --> 19:42.676
Friends overlook each other's
minor lapses.

19:44.189 --> 19:46.851
For the record, Howard,
I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

19:47.793 --> 19:49.260
Thank you.

19:49.428 --> 19:53.762
And I'm sorry about your phone
and Thanksgiving.

19:54.233 --> 19:58.397
And while we're at it, you don't have to
wash our clothes on the 4th of July.

19:59.738 --> 20:04.368
As long as we're apologizing, Sheldon,
I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

20:04.876 --> 20:06.400
And I'm sorry...

20:06.578 --> 20:09.911
...but that behavior is beyond the pale
and cannot be tolerated.

20:10.082 --> 20:11.982
We are no longer friends.

20:12.718 --> 20:15.983
I got you a talking Thomas
the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

20:16.622 --> 20:18.988
With real puffing smoke?

20:19.324 --> 20:20.757
Yes.

20:21.827 --> 20:23.294
All right.
