00:28.269 --> 00:30.971
On the eve
of another Independence Day,

00:31.005 --> 00:32.540
let us all remember

00:32.573 --> 00:35.375
the price of the freedom we enjoy.

00:35.409 --> 00:39.079
Along with those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice,

00:39.113 --> 00:44.618
113 local boys are unaccounted
for in the Pacific theater.

00:44.652 --> 00:47.554
They include Private
James Daryl of Bloomfield.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.490
Private Stuart Danforth of Bloomfield.

00:50.524 --> 00:54.195
Lance Corporal Francis R. Peabody.

00:54.229 --> 00:56.196
Private Hugo Bunker.

00:56.230 --> 00:59.933
Corporal George Higgins.
Private First Class...

01:38.973 --> 01:41.241
Son of a bitch.

02:04.365 --> 02:06.400
That's got to be north.

02:06.434 --> 02:07.801
Right?

02:11.005 --> 02:13.674
They said it would be just like Cambridge.

02:13.708 --> 02:14.841
Harvard with sand.

02:14.876 --> 02:17.310
Daddy's offer still stands.

02:17.344 --> 02:20.047
- It's a good job, Charles.
- It's a sales job.

02:20.081 --> 02:21.615
God forbid.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.784
You'd think a PhD was a vow of poverty.

02:23.818 --> 02:25.252
You know, business is a science.

02:25.286 --> 02:28.489
The recruiter said I could
be the next Enrico Fermi.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.427
He's like the Betty Grable of physics.

02:33.461 --> 02:35.062
Well, no one ever heard of him.

02:35.096 --> 02:37.865
Think of anyone heard of Galileo in 1590?

02:37.899 --> 02:41.702
I bet Galileo knew how to read a road map.

02:50.111 --> 02:52.613
Yeah, that's north.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.635
Excuse me. Hi.

04:21.668 --> 04:24.438
The circus in town?

04:24.472 --> 04:27.274
Just where is everybody going?

04:27.308 --> 04:29.876
PO box 1663.

04:29.911 --> 04:32.512
- What's the place called?
- It ain't.

04:32.546 --> 04:35.849
No name, no street signs.

04:35.883 --> 04:37.651
Welcome to nowhere.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.254
All right.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.225
Charlie, this doesn't look like Cambridge.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.169
You can't work in your
office like everybody else?

05:29.203 --> 05:30.671
Our group's on the chopping block

05:30.705 --> 05:32.705
and you're out till dawn
playing putt-putt in the desert.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.207
What makes a golf ball fly?

05:34.241 --> 05:35.942
Compression. The club hits the ball,

05:35.977 --> 05:38.278
the rubber core compresses, the ball sails.

05:38.312 --> 05:39.646
We're not talking about rubber.

05:39.681 --> 05:41.048
We're talking about solid metal.

05:41.082 --> 05:43.850
TNT yields pressures
of 100,000 atmospheres.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.020
We can supercompress the core of the bomb.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.157
Higher density, less plutonium.

05:57.198 --> 05:59.365
Oh, you son of a bitch.

06:44.178 --> 06:48.248
Someone invented pie crust in a box?

06:48.282 --> 06:52.552
How is that not on the cover
of "The New York Times"?

06:59.026 --> 07:01.261
The computers will need to stay all night.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.797
And we'll need some equipment.

07:03.831 --> 07:06.433
Some IBM machines for the hydrodynamics.

07:08.869 --> 07:10.637
I'll be right back.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.674
So is this all you got for corn?

07:14.708 --> 07:16.643
Yeah, we're cleared
out for the 4th of July.

07:16.677 --> 07:18.411
Shipment's due from El Paso next Tuesday.

07:18.446 --> 07:21.014
We can't grow our own corn on the Hill?

07:21.048 --> 07:25.052
You know the Indians have been
planting maize out here for 5,000 years.

07:25.086 --> 07:27.087
Army policy. The ground's no good.

07:27.121 --> 07:29.622
Oh, for heaven's sake.

07:29.656 --> 07:32.325
Rangeland soil is full of potassium.

07:34.461 --> 07:38.498
Ma'am, I'm sure your husband's
got a brain the size of Kansas,

07:38.532 --> 07:41.667
but that ring on your finger
doesn't make you a scientist.

07:41.702 --> 07:44.204
No, four years at Barnard

07:44.238 --> 07:46.706
and a PhD in botany do.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.675
I missed dinner.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.843
And breakfast.

07:50.878 --> 07:54.114
You know, most women would kill
for a night off from their husbands.

07:54.148 --> 07:57.450
Most women know what their
husbands do at the office.

07:58.752 --> 08:00.353
I'm not most women.

08:00.388 --> 08:02.422
You certainly are not.

08:05.226 --> 08:07.027
You've had a good night.

08:10.264 --> 08:12.198
I'll be home later.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.401
I promise.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.645
This line gets longer every day.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.216
Got your pass?

08:29.250 --> 08:31.517
Colonel's clamping down on security.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.587
Probably got the MPs going
through our trash at night.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.556
Here we go. Thank you.

08:36.590 --> 08:39.292
- All right, thank you.
- Okay.

08:39.326 --> 08:40.994
Would it kill you to say thank you?

08:41.028 --> 08:42.495
We need to start from scratch.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.130
We'll rebuild the math from the ground up.

08:44.164 --> 08:47.234
And we'll need a bigger
staff, Glen... like 15, 20 guys.

08:47.268 --> 08:49.469
- Where the hell are you going?
- I'm gonna run it upstairs.

08:49.503 --> 08:51.438
No, whoa. Hey, whoa.

08:51.472 --> 08:54.107
You can't just waltz
into Oppenheimer's office

08:54.141 --> 08:56.676
with some chicken scratches
on a cocktail napkin.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.745
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Hey, good morning.

09:00.682 --> 09:04.684
Akley, he wipes his ass
and calls it a design.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.853
Army writes him a check with six zeros.

09:06.888 --> 09:09.355
Reed Akley shaves every day.

09:09.390 --> 09:12.693
The only thing cleaner
than his face is his math.

09:12.727 --> 09:14.594
Well, it's too clean.

09:14.628 --> 09:16.462
There's something wrong with Akley's bomb.

09:16.497 --> 09:18.732
Forget Thin Man, okay? Forget Akley.

09:20.301 --> 09:22.035
100 American kids have been buried

09:22.070 --> 09:24.805
since the last time we
walked through that gate.

09:24.839 --> 09:27.140
By tomorrow morning, there'll be 100 more.

09:28.876 --> 09:30.877
And you want me to slow down?

09:30.912 --> 09:32.979
Of course not.

09:34.581 --> 09:36.349
We've spent six months in the woodshed

09:36.383 --> 09:38.485
living off table scraps.

09:38.519 --> 09:41.988
We both know our design
is better than Akley's.

09:42.022 --> 09:46.026
But if you go in there to
persuade Oppenheimer half-cocked,

09:46.060 --> 09:47.927
it's finished.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.679
Was that Frank Winter?

10:06.714 --> 10:08.581
Yeah.

10:08.615 --> 10:11.551
I submitted my thesis to the Princeton
physics journal when he was the editor.

10:11.585 --> 10:13.853
Six peer reviewers
backed it for publication.

10:13.887 --> 10:16.056
- He rejected it.
- Well, don't take it personally.

10:16.090 --> 10:17.557
He probably didn't even read it.

10:17.591 --> 10:19.059
He work for Dr. Akley too?

10:19.093 --> 10:20.560
No.

10:20.594 --> 10:23.363
No, he's got a band of misfits
working on an alternate design.

10:23.397 --> 10:25.932
Design for what?

10:25.967 --> 10:27.433
Forget Winter's group.

10:27.468 --> 10:28.969
They're the farm league, Charlie.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.171
You're joining the New York Yankees.

10:33.775 --> 10:35.775
The white badge is your key to the castle.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.111
Only scientists and army brass get them.

10:38.145 --> 10:42.182
Steno girls are allowed in the
building, but they don't know squat.

10:42.216 --> 10:44.250
Gis barely know what state they're in.

10:46.220 --> 10:48.221
They all read your paper.

10:48.255 --> 10:51.591
Passed it around like a Tijuana bible.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.294
You're looking at the best
equipped lab in the country.

10:54.328 --> 10:57.297
Two Van de Graaff
accelerators, our own cyclotron,

10:57.331 --> 11:00.233
and the finest computers money can buy.

11:00.267 --> 11:04.171
Computers, this is the youngest
buck who ever won the Forbes Prize.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.905
Say hello to Charlie Isaacs.

11:05.939 --> 11:07.540
Hi, Charlie.

11:07.574 --> 11:10.010
No lying down on the job, girls.

11:12.079 --> 11:13.946
We'll need you to answer some questions.

11:13.981 --> 11:15.882
Everybody on the project's
got to have security clearance.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.650
What is the project? They
still haven't told me.

11:17.684 --> 11:20.920
I'll leave that to Dr. Akley
once we have your commitment.

11:20.954 --> 11:22.989
How do I know what I'm committing to?

11:23.024 --> 11:25.258
Charlie.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.260
This is Shangri-La.

11:27.294 --> 11:29.695
We've got the highest combined
IQ of any town in America

11:29.730 --> 11:31.031
and more Jews than Babylon.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.399
You'll be wined and dined by the US Army

11:33.434 --> 11:35.368
until Hitler and the Japs say uncle.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.571
Who knows how long that'll be?

11:40.041 --> 11:43.810
Well, that all depends on us.

11:56.690 --> 11:59.759
Say Oppenheimer picks
Akley's design over ours.

11:59.793 --> 12:02.862
It's still possible they'll keep
us around, right, as a backup plan?

12:02.896 --> 12:05.632
If a career falls in the desert
and there's no one there to hear it,

12:05.666 --> 12:06.967
does it make a sound?

12:07.001 --> 12:08.268
Frank will figure something out.

12:08.302 --> 12:09.569
Oh, come on. We're wasting our time.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.204
Akley's got a staff of 600 on Thin Man.

12:11.238 --> 12:13.606
We've got six chaps. One of them's a girl.

12:15.643 --> 12:18.278
You're late!

12:20.847 --> 12:23.616
This was yesterday.

12:23.651 --> 12:26.252
This is tomorrow.

12:28.689 --> 12:32.192
Now, the math here is simple.
Only one variable matters.

12:32.226 --> 12:35.395
Time.

12:35.429 --> 12:38.831
It's gonna take a year to produce
enough plutonium to make Akley's bomb.

12:38.865 --> 12:42.368
But with a supercompressed core,

12:42.403 --> 12:45.805
I think we can shave a week
off that timeline, maybe longer.

12:45.839 --> 12:48.007
Now, the army still hasn't decided

12:48.041 --> 12:49.675
which design they're gonna back yet,

12:49.710 --> 12:51.243
but they're going to any day now,

12:51.278 --> 12:53.480
and before they do, we
need to prove how much time

12:53.514 --> 12:54.915
our model is gonna save them.

12:54.949 --> 12:57.918
And Oppenheimer is leaving for DC tomorrow.

12:57.952 --> 12:59.352
So if we want to
keep this group intact,

12:59.386 --> 13:01.187
we're gonna have to get some
hard numbers in his hands

13:01.222 --> 13:03.255
before he gets on that plane.

13:03.290 --> 13:06.659
Yeah, we're gonna miss
dinner again, aren't we?

13:06.694 --> 13:08.894
- Fritz.
- So we're gonna scrap three months

13:08.929 --> 13:11.331
of work for the chance that we
can save the army one week?

13:11.365 --> 13:14.734
Somewhere in Germany, Hitler's
got a town just like this one

13:14.768 --> 13:17.870
full of scientists hungrier than you.

13:17.904 --> 13:20.806
That week we save could
be the week that matters.

13:55.176 --> 13:58.744
Yoo-hoo. Hello.

13:58.779 --> 14:01.448
We're not snooping.

14:01.482 --> 14:03.315
Hello.

14:03.350 --> 14:05.718
We're the welcome wagon.

14:05.753 --> 14:09.155
This is Fay and Dot and I'm Rose Akley.

14:09.189 --> 14:12.057
- Abby.

14:12.092 --> 14:14.427
Oh!
Oh, um...

14:14.461 --> 14:17.263
Technically Reed is your
husband's boss's boss.

14:17.298 --> 14:20.800
But we don't stand on
ceremony, do we, ladies?

14:22.970 --> 14:24.570
Thin walls.

14:41.955 --> 14:43.689
You think she's packed enough shoes?

14:43.724 --> 14:46.226
What church are
you? Lutheran? Methodist?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.860
Physicist.

14:47.894 --> 14:50.530
Charlie's god is Albert Einstein.

14:50.564 --> 14:52.632
You're lucky with a toddler.

14:52.666 --> 14:54.434
They ration the Indians.

14:54.468 --> 14:56.469
You'll jump straight to
the front of the line.

14:56.503 --> 14:59.939
Just watch out the help doesn't
smoke your husband's peace pipe.

14:59.973 --> 15:01.541
Don't tell my Walter.

15:01.575 --> 15:04.677
If the men can keep secrets,
we're entitled to a few of our own.

15:04.711 --> 15:06.111
What do you mean?

15:06.146 --> 15:09.882
Oh, you know, what they
do behind their fences.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.584
What are the men building?

15:11.619 --> 15:14.086
I hear they're building submarines
and floating them down the Rio Grande.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.988
Fay!

15:18.191 --> 15:21.260
They look like little convicts.

15:21.294 --> 15:23.062
Head lice.

15:24.698 --> 15:28.568
- What was that?
- You're gonna love it here, really.

15:38.078 --> 15:40.480
Supercompression. Why
didn't I think of that?

15:40.514 --> 15:42.715
'Cause Frank's smarter
than you by a factor of 14.

15:42.749 --> 15:44.550
Not that it matters.
Akley's gonna win the war.

15:44.585 --> 15:45.751
He'll probably win the Nobel Prize.

15:45.786 --> 15:46.752
We'll still be crunching numbers.

15:46.787 --> 15:49.055
Here, look at this.

15:49.090 --> 15:52.425
Crosley, Fedowitz, Liao, Meeks,
Prins, you need to come with us.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.927
If this is about the colonel's
horse, I had nothing to do with it.

15:54.962 --> 15:57.563
Recognize this? Came
out of your file cabinet.

15:57.598 --> 15:59.198
There's pages missing.

15:59.232 --> 16:00.700
Somebody better call Interpol.

16:00.734 --> 16:03.970
You familiar with the Espionage Act?

16:05.339 --> 16:08.007
Whoever lawfully or
unlawfully having access to

16:08.041 --> 16:09.842
or being entrusted
with any document...

16:09.877 --> 16:12.144
Whoa, whoa. Espionage?

16:12.178 --> 16:14.814
No more wisecracks?

16:14.848 --> 16:17.083
You hear the one about the
Chink in the electric chair?

16:17.117 --> 16:19.785
- What the hell's going on?
- That's what we'd like to find out, sir.

16:19.820 --> 16:22.255
We believe a member of your
group is stealing secrets.

16:22.289 --> 16:24.657
Get out.

16:24.691 --> 16:26.859
Dr. Winter, G-2 has credible
intelligence that one...

16:26.894 --> 16:30.630
All I've seen from the G-2 is an
incredible lack of intelligence.

16:30.664 --> 16:33.232
They haven't even told you what
you're doing here, have they?

16:33.266 --> 16:35.702
Do you have any idea
what you are looking at?

16:35.736 --> 16:37.637
Sir, we're not here to debate science.

16:37.671 --> 16:39.471
That's not science.

16:39.506 --> 16:43.143
That's the property of the government
of the United States of America.

16:43.177 --> 16:45.177
Our work is so classified,

16:45.211 --> 16:47.847
the vice president doesn't know we exist.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.749
As far as he's concerned,
the Manhattan Project

16:49.783 --> 16:51.483
is a leaky tunnel on the IRT.

16:51.518 --> 16:54.286
And yet you're gonna stand
there, Sergeant First Class,

16:54.321 --> 16:56.389
with your J-3 security clearance

16:56.423 --> 16:59.125
and you're gonna talk to me about protocol?

16:59.159 --> 17:02.428
You could be court-martialed
for just opening that file.

17:06.165 --> 17:08.267
This isn't finished.

17:10.771 --> 17:14.440
I don't have time for this shit.

17:14.474 --> 17:16.476
And neither do you, not today.

18:24.310 --> 18:26.312
- You're crooked.
- Oh.

18:28.749 --> 18:30.549
Thank you.

18:31.752 --> 18:32.819
Dr. Akley.

18:34.755 --> 18:37.123
"A New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology."

18:40.994 --> 18:42.828
I wish I'd written it.

18:46.867 --> 18:50.302
I have not seen real
bourbon since Pearl Harbor.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.272
Well, I got friends in high places.

18:52.306 --> 18:54.740
It's called a signing bonus.

18:54.775 --> 18:57.109
Charlie Isaacs,

18:57.143 --> 18:58.745
tell me why you're here.

18:58.779 --> 19:00.980
Sir?

19:01.014 --> 19:02.482
You drove 2,000 miles.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.450
You uprooted your family to a state

19:04.485 --> 19:06.518
with more cattle than people.

19:06.553 --> 19:07.654
What do you want?

19:07.688 --> 19:10.056
To serve my country. I tried to enlist.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.157
Flat feet.

19:12.192 --> 19:16.128
Yeah, well, I think we can
put your skills to better use.

19:19.266 --> 19:22.435
We're waging a war of ideas.

19:22.469 --> 19:25.371
Now, this war will be
fought on the battlefield,

19:25.406 --> 19:29.809
but make no mistake that peace
will be won with brains, not brawn.

19:29.843 --> 19:32.378
Now, forget about code breaking.

19:32.412 --> 19:35.047
Forget about
meteorology, optics...

19:35.081 --> 19:37.116
You're building an atomic bomb.

19:39.452 --> 19:41.888
We prefer to call it a gadget.

19:46.327 --> 19:48.327
I walk most of the new
boys through the math,

19:48.361 --> 19:49.962
they still don't see it.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.338
I was told I'd be working in a radar lab.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.973
Well, I'm sorry for the smoke and mirrors.

20:01.007 --> 20:03.075
We can't exactly advertise.

20:07.981 --> 20:10.282
Dean Everett at Harvard

20:10.317 --> 20:13.353
says you're the quickest
study he's seen in years.

20:15.288 --> 20:17.957
He also says you want to help your people.

20:17.991 --> 20:20.192
I understand you have family in Poland.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.965
A bomb like
that... gadget...

20:28.335 --> 20:33.205
the burn radius would be miles wide.

20:33.239 --> 20:35.240
The gamma rays
alone would be...

20:35.275 --> 20:37.977
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

20:38.011 --> 20:40.747
You can grow old and
die writing white papers

20:40.781 --> 20:43.082
on field quantization.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.417
100 savants will read your work,

20:45.451 --> 20:48.287
maybe 10 will understand it.

20:48.321 --> 20:50.255
Or you can join my team

20:50.290 --> 20:53.425
and you can watch the
apple fall with Newton.

22:01.418 --> 22:03.986
Go home. Go have dinner with your wife.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.955
We need to finish running these numbers.

22:05.989 --> 22:08.958
Leave that to the peanut gallery.

22:11.227 --> 22:14.430
I mean it. If this job kills you,

22:14.464 --> 22:16.832
Liza is gonna kill me.

22:30.213 --> 22:33.515
You're not gonna believe
this. The water went out again.

22:33.549 --> 22:36.485
They better fix it before tomorrow.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.289
July 4th.

22:40.323 --> 22:42.391
Frank, half the Hill is
gonna be in our backyard

22:42.425 --> 22:43.959
and you know how they like to drink.

22:43.993 --> 22:45.861
This is not the best week.

22:45.896 --> 22:48.397
Well, I didn't set the date.

22:48.431 --> 22:50.599
Take it up with Thomas Jefferson.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.638
Frank.

23:03.313 --> 23:07.383
Did you know people like to
socialize on Independence Day?

23:07.417 --> 23:10.685
They like to stand around in the
backyard and eat grilled meats

23:10.720 --> 23:13.788
and listen to John Philip Sousa. Gracias.

23:13.823 --> 23:15.457
And tomorrow, for one night,

23:15.491 --> 23:18.894
we're going to pretend
we have a normal life.

23:18.929 --> 23:22.064
You in the kitchen is the
definition of abnormal.

23:22.098 --> 23:24.599
But in the spirit
of independence...

23:24.634 --> 23:26.702
- No.
- No what?

23:26.737 --> 23:28.137
No, you can't go to school in New York.

23:28.171 --> 23:29.605
But New York is the center of the world.

23:29.639 --> 23:31.106
Yes, it is.

23:31.141 --> 23:33.542
The world of cigarettes and premarital sex.

23:33.576 --> 23:36.712
Apparently, Callie has sent in an
application to the Chapin School.

23:36.746 --> 23:39.781
Dad, Anna Roosevelt went there.

23:39.816 --> 23:41.817
They have state-of-the-art
science labs,

23:41.852 --> 23:44.486
it's right next door to
the Metropolitan Museum.

23:44.521 --> 23:47.623
Seven million people live in New York.

23:47.657 --> 23:50.626
It's the most densely
populated city in America.

23:51.728 --> 23:54.930
Right on the Eastern Seaboard.

23:54.965 --> 23:56.832
And?

23:56.867 --> 24:00.069
And the army would never let you go.

24:04.740 --> 24:07.509
So I'm just supposed to stay
here in this prison camp?

24:07.544 --> 24:09.578
Get knocked up by one of the guards?

24:09.612 --> 24:10.845
Oh, don't be vulgar.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.647
Why are we even here?

24:20.223 --> 24:22.391
Everything is a secret!

24:23.927 --> 24:25.927
It's Kafkaesque!

24:29.766 --> 24:32.301
Well, at least she's reading.

24:32.335 --> 24:34.736
We've been working forever.

24:34.770 --> 24:37.339
Barely made a dent. These are for you.

24:37.374 --> 24:40.376
What's the over-under on how much
time we'll shave off Thin Man?

24:40.410 --> 24:42.444
I got a Mars Bar that says 10 days.

24:42.478 --> 24:44.646
You honestly think we're
gonna outflank Reed Akley

24:44.681 --> 24:46.548
and a staff of 600 by 10 days?

24:46.583 --> 24:48.683
No, honestly, I think
we're gonna beat them by 20,

24:48.718 --> 24:50.485
but I'm spineless, so my money's on 10.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.321
Honestly, my money's on it doesn't matter

24:52.355 --> 24:54.390
'cause we're never gonna finish by morning.

24:54.424 --> 24:56.859
Here.

24:56.893 --> 25:00.196
Whoa. Nylons?

25:00.230 --> 25:03.165
Yeah, he steals
them from the storage annex.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.234
What the hell do you
want with ladies' nylons?

25:05.268 --> 25:08.069
- They're rationed.
- And?

25:08.104 --> 25:10.372
Girls love them. Girls can't get 'em.

25:10.407 --> 25:12.341
I spread the wealth,
they spread their legs.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.209
We need reinforcements.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.378
We've got to have the
calculations by tomorrow.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.947
- You are our only hope.
- We're punched out for the night.

25:18.981 --> 25:20.649
We can pay you.

25:22.485 --> 25:24.386
Crosley.

25:31.894 --> 25:33.362
- Great.
- All right.

25:33.396 --> 25:35.831
Oh, great. Fantastic.

25:35.866 --> 25:37.666
Thank you.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.601
Hi, my name's Fritz.

25:39.635 --> 25:42.404
That's for you. Hi. Fritz.

25:42.439 --> 25:44.406
Hi, you can call me Fritz.

25:56.887 --> 25:58.920
I give up.

26:00.523 --> 26:03.725
This chrysanthemum, it's
supposed to be white.

26:03.759 --> 26:05.294
So it's a hybrid.

26:11.334 --> 26:13.502
Did you know

26:13.536 --> 26:16.605
that we're not allowed to
grow produce on the Hill?

26:19.209 --> 26:21.643
Must be something to do with the soil.

26:22.945 --> 26:26.214
Well, sometimes a flower is just a flower.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.688
Don't go and work.

26:32.722 --> 26:35.524
Well, I have to finish some things.

26:35.558 --> 26:37.526
What things?

26:40.296 --> 26:43.732
When it's over, we will
go anywhere you want.

26:43.766 --> 26:46.235
We'll find a desert
island, play Adam and Eve.

26:46.269 --> 26:48.237
Good night.

26:54.777 --> 26:57.712
Watch it, buddy.

26:57.747 --> 26:59.881
Get out of the way!

27:05.455 --> 27:07.189
Abby?

27:10.893 --> 27:13.428
Charlie, what on earth? It's this one.

27:13.463 --> 27:15.864
This one. Come inside.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.168
I was about to call the police,

27:19.202 --> 27:21.437
but, you know, there's no
telephone in this place.

27:22.472 --> 27:24.139
Shh.

27:24.174 --> 27:27.109
This is Daddy's brand.
You can't get this anymore.

27:27.143 --> 27:29.611
You can if your work's
got triple-A priority.

27:29.645 --> 27:31.280
Shh! Are you drunk?

27:31.314 --> 27:33.382
- Oh, shit.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.250
- Charlie?

27:35.284 --> 27:37.319
It's the whole street.

27:43.926 --> 27:48.464
You know how many people live in Berlin?

27:48.498 --> 27:50.432
Men, women, kids?

27:51.801 --> 27:53.802
I wrote a letter to my father.

27:55.004 --> 27:56.571
I said you'd think about his offer.

27:56.606 --> 27:59.875
Oh, Jesus, Abby. This is what I am.

28:00.943 --> 28:04.479
You are a loving father to our son.

28:05.882 --> 28:08.750
And you are my handsome husband.

28:11.086 --> 28:13.655
Take off your nightgown.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.690
Charlie.

28:15.725 --> 28:18.760
Joey's out cold. He won't hear us.

28:18.794 --> 28:21.696
It's not Joey I'm worried about.

28:21.731 --> 28:25.634
Oh, give them something
to put in our FBI file.

28:27.003 --> 28:28.970
Hmm?

28:29.004 --> 28:31.540
Hmm?

28:34.677 --> 28:36.612
Come on.

28:36.646 --> 28:42.051
♪ I just want
to be the one you love ♪

28:42.085 --> 28:44.553

29:29.064 --> 29:30.532
No! No!

29:42.645 --> 29:45.847
Whatever it is, Frank, you can tell me.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.718
I can't.

29:57.338 --> 30:00.140
Does the ringing in your ears
increase with stress?

30:00.174 --> 30:01.641
No.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.310
Some of the men find it helpful
to speak with the chaplain.

30:04.345 --> 30:07.513
And they're not all religious.

30:07.548 --> 30:10.516
We give chloral hydrate
for sleep disorders.

30:10.551 --> 30:12.185
I can write you a script.

30:12.219 --> 30:13.820
But if you'll take
a word of advice...

30:13.854 --> 30:15.722
I'll take the pills.

30:35.476 --> 30:37.410
Nothing to worry about.

30:51.024 --> 30:53.893
This wind's gonna blow
us all the way to Kansas.

30:58.866 --> 31:01.333
There's no place like home.

31:03.704 --> 31:05.805
How many drunken physicists

31:05.839 --> 31:08.541
do you reckon we can cram into that shack?

31:09.943 --> 31:11.877
Lo siento.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.648
Let's take it inside.

31:21.021 --> 31:22.889
There we go, right there.

31:29.663 --> 31:31.597
Whoa.

32:00.227 --> 32:02.462
Mommy, my head itches.

32:05.032 --> 32:07.032
I'm tired.

32:08.636 --> 32:11.271
We need copies for Oppenheimer
so he can sell it in DC.

32:11.305 --> 32:12.772
Where are we on the numbers?

32:12.806 --> 32:14.641
Still at it and we're
running out of nylons.

32:14.675 --> 32:17.110
All right, let's
go. Outside, right now.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.611
Leave everything where it is.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.813
Touch nothing.

32:20.847 --> 32:22.482
I'll get it.

32:25.853 --> 32:27.320
What the hell is going on?

32:27.354 --> 32:29.522
They're arresting Bill Timchak.

32:30.924 --> 32:32.825
Some files turned up in his dorm room.

32:32.859 --> 32:34.861
- They can do that?
- All right, let's move.

32:34.895 --> 32:37.162
They've got tanks. They
can do whatever they like.

32:43.370 --> 32:45.938
Colonel's collecting scalps.

32:45.972 --> 32:48.207
Word is he's just getting started.

33:05.926 --> 33:08.328
Don't tell me. They arrested the computers.

33:14.668 --> 33:18.104
Frank, I made a mistake.

33:18.138 --> 33:19.805
I, uh...

33:19.840 --> 33:22.708
I screwed up.

33:22.743 --> 33:25.177
I swear to God I am not a spy. You know me.

33:30.851 --> 33:33.119
It's the X-ray studies.

33:33.153 --> 33:34.921
You said it was my best work.

33:39.126 --> 33:41.594
What the hell did you do?

33:41.629 --> 33:43.729
I've got a kid back in Oakland.

33:43.764 --> 33:45.264
Gracie.

33:46.767 --> 33:48.434
She's sick and her meds cost a fortune.

33:48.469 --> 33:51.904
I just thought when we all go back
home, I could sell the patents.

33:51.939 --> 33:53.573
They're gonna figure that out.

33:53.607 --> 33:55.074
You got to help me out, Frank.

33:55.108 --> 33:57.944
Talk to the colonel.
Explain why I took 'em.

33:59.980 --> 34:02.715
You stole secrets from
the United States Army.

34:02.750 --> 34:05.752
You really think the colonel's
gonna stick around for a chitchat?

34:05.786 --> 34:07.920
So what are you gonna do?

34:12.559 --> 34:14.260
I'm gonna burn them.

34:14.295 --> 34:16.128
They can't touch you if
they don't have proof.

34:16.161 --> 34:18.464
You got to get me transferred.
Send me to Chicago.

34:18.498 --> 34:21.233
Or Site X. Christ,
Frank, I've got a family.

34:21.268 --> 34:24.437
Then act like it! You want to protect them?

34:24.471 --> 34:27.572
You go out there and do your
goddamn job like the rest of us.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.354
- Two, one.

35:57.397 --> 35:59.065
Colonel Cox wants to see you.

35:59.099 --> 36:00.967
I'm not holding office hours today.

36:01.001 --> 36:02.535
Now.

36:13.346 --> 36:15.581
This can't be right. Did
you remember to check the...

36:15.616 --> 36:17.049
It's right.

36:23.791 --> 36:26.326
One of your boys stole
classified files. I'd like a name.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.061
So you can stick him in
a hole till the end of the war?

36:29.096 --> 36:31.931
I have a brother in the 4th Marine Raiders

36:31.965 --> 36:35.000
in the Solomon Islands who
wants to come home to his family.

36:35.035 --> 36:38.438
I knew nine men on the USS
Arizona who won't get that chance.

36:38.472 --> 36:41.307
Our enemy crawled out of a cave
on the other side of this Earth

36:41.342 --> 36:43.876
and attacked us on our own
soil, and they'll do it again.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.811
We will not hand them the tools.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.317
There's a leak in this lab.

36:51.351 --> 36:53.986
Someone's been smuggling
tactical schematics off the Hill.

36:54.020 --> 36:55.554
There is no spy in my group.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.389
You think Bill Timchak was a spy?

36:57.424 --> 37:00.660
He's an example. We live
in a world of consequences.

37:04.164 --> 37:07.033
Must be lonely out there in the boondocks.

37:07.067 --> 37:10.369
No resources, no
recognition for your group.

37:10.403 --> 37:12.838
We're not here for the recognition.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.777
I got a shipment in this morning.

37:19.679 --> 37:22.748
10 state-of-the-art
IBM machines.

37:22.783 --> 37:26.185
You think I'd horse-trade
a member of my own team?

37:26.219 --> 37:29.321
Paucos immolamus ad servandos multos.

37:29.356 --> 37:31.757
We sacrifice the few to save the many.

37:39.933 --> 37:41.968
- 12 days?
- 12 weeks!

37:47.340 --> 37:50.977
Hey, Dolores. I just need
two minutes of his time.

37:51.011 --> 37:53.679
Dr. Oppenheimer doesn't have
an opening until the 18th.

37:53.714 --> 37:56.115
It'll just take... - It'll have
to wait till he's back from DC.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.683
He's already down in the car.

37:57.718 --> 37:59.886
- I'll ride with him. That'll do.
- No, Frank.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.921
- Thanks, Dolores.
- Frank, there's...

38:06.292 --> 38:09.629
We can cut 12
weeks off Akley's timeline.

38:12.432 --> 38:15.234
I thought we were going to the airport.

38:16.970 --> 38:19.238
Lamy train depot.

38:19.272 --> 38:22.008
General's seen fit to ground me.

38:22.042 --> 38:24.710
It's too dangerous to fly.
Isn't that right, Tommy?

38:28.581 --> 38:31.583
It's very touching, their
concern for my health.

38:33.486 --> 38:35.988
It's been road-tested and
triple-checked, Robert.

38:37.790 --> 38:39.659
If you'll just give me some IBM machines

38:39.693 --> 38:41.393
and 30 more men,

38:41.428 --> 38:43.863
I can have the hydrodynamics
worked out in the next month.

38:46.399 --> 38:49.068
This country, the Valles Caldera...

38:50.804 --> 38:54.306
We call it a desert,
but it's a crematorium.

38:55.675 --> 38:59.144
The mesas, all of it...
fallout from a volcano

38:59.179 --> 39:01.947
that exploded a million
and a half years ago.

39:03.850 --> 39:06.485
Someday it'll detonate
again, and everything you see

39:06.519 --> 39:08.521
will be buried.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.555
Just a question of time.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.528
There are forces beyond our control.

39:18.665 --> 39:21.067
The United States Army is one of them.

39:23.637 --> 39:25.337
Your group's going to be dissolved, Frank.

39:25.371 --> 39:26.772
What?

39:26.807 --> 39:28.473
We're building Akley's bomb.

39:28.508 --> 39:32.211
- The ship has sailed.
- Well, turn it around.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.746
This war chews up four
American kids every hour.

39:34.781 --> 39:37.283
I just handed you 8,000 lives.

39:38.685 --> 39:41.320
Man is made by his belief.

39:41.354 --> 39:44.123
As he believes, so he is.

39:44.157 --> 39:45.958
The army believes in the Thin Man.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.359
I don't give a shit about the army.

39:47.394 --> 39:49.895
That's your mistake.

39:51.197 --> 39:52.331
Tommy.

40:08.882 --> 40:10.816
What about you, Robert?

40:10.850 --> 40:12.351
What do you believe?

40:12.385 --> 40:15.187
I believe the world is on fire.

40:15.221 --> 40:17.590
And Thin Man's our chance to put it out.

40:19.159 --> 40:21.326
You'll report directly to Akley.

40:49.856 --> 40:51.623
Hey!

40:51.658 --> 40:54.326
Hey, wait! That's my equipment.

41:13.346 --> 41:16.015
Glen, what the hell is this?

41:16.049 --> 41:18.517
Got my dishonorable discharge.

41:18.551 --> 41:20.352
Colonel's shipping me off-site.

41:20.387 --> 41:22.288
No. We'll go over his head.

41:22.322 --> 41:24.356
It's not just me.

41:24.390 --> 41:25.857
It's the whole group.

41:25.892 --> 41:27.559
I'll call the Secretary of War.

41:27.594 --> 41:30.329
I'll tell him our work is vital
to the success of this project.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.564
Frank. Frank.

41:39.873 --> 41:42.141
You were the best student I ever had.

41:44.277 --> 41:46.778
And you know

41:46.813 --> 41:50.850
that I would back you
to the edge of the Earth.

41:52.352 --> 41:54.987
But I think we just fell off it.

42:57.350 --> 43:00.652
Abby, what the hell did
you do to Joey's hair?

43:01.687 --> 43:04.223
They are reading our mail.

43:04.257 --> 43:06.959
- What?
- All the children have head lice

43:06.993 --> 43:08.494
and they are reading our mail.

43:08.528 --> 43:11.096
He's three years old. He
can barely read his name.

43:11.131 --> 43:12.998
I mailed this yesterday. A private letter

43:13.033 --> 43:15.467
from me to my father and
they made notes in the margin.

43:15.501 --> 43:17.068
- Who did?
- I don't know who.

43:17.103 --> 43:18.837
- Spies, the army, I don't know.
- Abigail.

43:18.871 --> 43:20.439
This place, these people,
they are all crazy.

43:20.473 --> 43:22.474
We cannot... I will not stay.
- You're hysterical.

43:22.509 --> 43:24.376
I can't even tell him where we live.

43:24.410 --> 43:26.712
I can't even tell him that
our house is painted green.

43:26.747 --> 43:28.813
It'll take some adjustment, that's all.

43:28.848 --> 43:31.417
No, we are going back to Brookline
and we can stay with my parents.

43:31.451 --> 43:33.485
No, we are not going anywhere!

43:33.519 --> 43:35.354
Listen to me. This is our home.

43:35.388 --> 43:37.556
I made a commitment. It is done.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.627
We're here till the end of the war.

44:08.120 --> 44:09.955
Shit.

44:09.990 --> 44:11.991
It's the altitude.

44:15.195 --> 44:18.764
Charlie, please, why in
God's name would we stay here?

44:28.408 --> 44:30.276
Okay.

44:30.310 --> 44:32.344
What I'm about to tell you

44:32.378 --> 44:35.247
is highly classified.

44:57.342 --> 45:01.612
Hey, how are we doing? Coming through.

45:07.985 --> 45:09.753
Oh! Sorry.

45:09.787 --> 45:12.423
I knew you wouldn't let a
little wind spoil your party.

45:12.457 --> 45:14.692
We'll make a housewife out
of you yet, Liza Winter.

45:14.726 --> 45:16.360
I look forward to that, Rose.

45:16.394 --> 45:17.895
Where's your husband?

45:17.930 --> 45:19.796
I'm afraid that's above
my security clearance.

45:19.831 --> 45:21.798
Excuse me.

45:24.936 --> 45:26.837
Take it through there.

45:27.906 --> 45:29.707
I finally get used to the desert air,

45:29.741 --> 45:31.575
then they send me off to Site W

45:31.610 --> 45:33.644
to study the effects of alpha particles

45:33.678 --> 45:35.579
on salmon reproduction.

45:35.613 --> 45:37.080
Fish sex.

45:37.115 --> 45:39.616
Well, it beats the
Chickasaw Ordnance Works.

45:39.651 --> 45:41.719
They're shipping my ass off to Tennessee.

45:41.753 --> 45:43.487
I told my mother I got a promotion.

45:45.257 --> 45:48.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pace
yourself there, Seabiscuit.

45:48.893 --> 45:51.695
Jesus, this is a
15-year-old scotch.

46:24.796 --> 46:26.830
The man of the hour.

46:36.108 --> 46:39.377
Hello, ladies. How are you?

46:47.752 --> 46:49.553
Where have you been?

46:49.588 --> 46:52.022
I have half the PhDs in America

46:52.056 --> 46:54.492
eating canapés in our front room.

46:54.526 --> 46:56.860
Get rid of them.

46:56.895 --> 46:58.462
What?

46:59.464 --> 47:01.765
Cancel the party.

47:15.213 --> 47:17.380
Did something happen at work?

47:17.415 --> 47:19.416
Work is fine.

47:21.486 --> 47:23.854
We made a deal when we came here.

47:23.888 --> 47:26.189
I would never ask you questions

47:26.224 --> 47:27.991
unless I absolutely needed answers

47:28.026 --> 47:29.660
and you would never lie to me.

47:29.694 --> 47:31.662
And I haven't.

47:42.107 --> 47:44.241
Frank.

47:46.411 --> 47:49.647
Do you remember when I presented that paper

47:49.681 --> 47:52.483
on the purple orchid?

47:52.517 --> 47:54.751
Orchis mascula.

47:56.153 --> 47:58.289
It lives on three continents.

47:58.323 --> 48:00.191
Sun or shade,

48:00.225 --> 48:01.725
from Spain to Siberia,

48:01.760 --> 48:04.595
it can survive almost anywhere.

48:04.629 --> 48:07.230
But it can't survive alone.

48:07.265 --> 48:09.533
It's got a partner.

48:09.568 --> 48:13.504
It attaches itself to
the roots of the orchid.

48:13.538 --> 48:16.507
It's called a mycorrhiza.

48:16.541 --> 48:19.643
And they make up their
own little ecosystem.

48:21.246 --> 48:24.948
If you cut off that communication,

48:24.982 --> 48:27.284
the orchid just shuts down.

48:29.821 --> 48:32.589
We had our own ecosystem.

48:34.158 --> 48:36.193
The two of us.

48:37.495 --> 48:39.530
You're not a flower.

48:43.468 --> 48:46.269
We're not talking about me, Frank.

48:50.508 --> 48:53.577
I'm protecting our family.

48:55.313 --> 48:57.581
From what?

49:25.877 --> 49:28.078
I hear you all had fun last night.

49:30.682 --> 49:33.984
Your husband must be important
to rate a place on Snob Hollow.

49:34.018 --> 49:37.821
I'd live in a wigwam if it would
help them build it any faster.

49:37.856 --> 49:39.890
Build what?

49:41.192 --> 49:42.526
Your husband told you something.

49:42.561 --> 49:45.696
- Oh...
- Well, don't hold out.

49:49.868 --> 49:51.935
They call it the gadget.

49:53.805 --> 49:57.641
It's a very complicated radar system

49:57.676 --> 49:59.810
that can spot one of Hitler's warplanes

49:59.844 --> 50:01.645
from the other side of the world.

50:05.383 --> 50:08.418
There's no telling how many
lives they're going to save.

50:20.898 --> 50:22.800
Conclusive proof,

50:22.834 --> 50:25.302
Orientals cannot hold their drink.

50:25.336 --> 50:27.338
All right, why don't you
sit this one out, buddy?

50:27.372 --> 50:29.606
You people, you got your heads in the sand.

50:29.641 --> 50:31.909
You send your kids to school
right next to it.

50:31.943 --> 50:35.178
- Lie to your wives about it.

50:54.132 --> 50:56.667
You don't like fireworks?

50:56.701 --> 50:59.870
Bombs bursting in air? Nah, not much.

51:02.907 --> 51:05.575
You read a paper of mine.

51:05.609 --> 51:08.011
"New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology."

51:08.046 --> 51:10.781
- Right.
- Your approach wasn't...

51:10.815 --> 51:12.349
new.

51:12.384 --> 51:16.453
The judges of the Forbes
Prize didn't see a problem.

51:16.488 --> 51:18.722
They wouldn't.

51:20.424 --> 51:24.595
You know, after you rejected my paper,

51:24.629 --> 51:27.765
I read everything you ever published.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.734
You'll do fine.

51:30.769 --> 51:33.203
You're Akley's new toy, right?

51:37.408 --> 51:39.543
Can I ask you something?

51:42.046 --> 51:43.747
What about the next war?

51:45.817 --> 51:49.520
What happens when Stalin's got one?

51:49.554 --> 51:51.689
China?

51:51.723 --> 51:53.590
The Shah of Iran.

52:00.799 --> 52:02.766
You know the story of the golem?

52:04.769 --> 52:09.139
A rabbi wanted to protect
the Jews of Prague,

52:09.173 --> 52:12.209
so he built an automaton out of mud,

52:12.243 --> 52:14.011
brought it to life.

52:14.045 --> 52:16.914
First the golem kills
the enemies of the Jews.

52:16.948 --> 52:19.082
Then it turns on Jews themselves.

52:20.551 --> 52:23.120
See, he couldn't control it.

52:23.154 --> 52:26.056
He'd built Frankenstein's monster.

52:28.993 --> 52:30.861
You been to Prague lately?

52:32.329 --> 52:34.397
There aren't any Jews left.

53:03.695 --> 53:06.329
There's something
I need to tell you.

53:06.364 --> 53:08.031
Whoo, happy Fourth!

53:08.066 --> 53:10.200
We're building a weapon.

53:10.234 --> 53:13.870
It's not like any weapon
the world's ever seen.

53:13.905 --> 53:17.574
It draws its energy from a
fast-neutron chain reaction.

53:19.010 --> 53:21.712
It releases the power of an ancient star.

53:23.247 --> 53:25.115
If it works,

53:25.149 --> 53:28.685
and it's going to work,

53:28.720 --> 53:31.087
it'll be more destructive
than all the bombs

53:31.122 --> 53:34.725
dropped in all the wars
in history put together.

53:36.861 --> 53:39.963
It'll bring armies to their knees.

53:39.998 --> 53:42.833
Cities will disappear
in the blink of an eye.

53:42.867 --> 53:44.935
The world will be united in peace

53:44.969 --> 53:49.072
by the most just and noble
country in the history of mankind.

53:49.106 --> 53:52.442
Or it will burn to the ground.

53:52.476 --> 53:54.945
Whoever builds it first,

53:54.979 --> 53:56.746
that's the endgame.

53:56.780 --> 53:59.782
So it has to be us.

54:03.087 --> 54:05.155
Whatever it costs.

54:10.528 --> 54:12.896
No entiendo.
