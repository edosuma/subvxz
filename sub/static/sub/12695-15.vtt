WEBVTT

00:09.933 --> 00:12.633
- Stop! Clean up your dishes.

00:12.733 --> 00:14.567
- Uh, those aren't mine.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.467
- Max.

00:18.867 --> 00:20.967
You're so good at dishes.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.400
- And soon you will be, too--

00:22.500 --> 00:25.067
'cause now you're
doing all of them.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.967
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

00:27.067 --> 00:29.267
Son of Evil Man approaching.

00:29.367 --> 00:32.233
- PHOEBE: Got it! Got it!
Got it! Got it! Got it!

00:32.333 --> 00:33.767
- Phoebe's hangin' out
with Evil Man's son

00:33.867 --> 00:35.233
and I'm doin' dishes.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.133
Am I in Crazytown?
- No, you're in Dishville--

00:38.233 --> 00:40.400
which is right next to
Get-to-scrubbin'-berg.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.133
- Hi, Link.
- Hi, Phoebe.

00:47.233 --> 00:50.133
- Oh, I am so excited
to go ice skating.

00:50.233 --> 00:53.500
I'm no pro, but I hear
the secret is leg warmers.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.833
A-boh!

00:55.933 --> 00:58.333
- Listen, I'm really sorry,
but I can't go ice skating.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.367
- Yeah, not with all
that exposed leg.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.300
You are begging for an ice rash.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.933
- Actually, my dad's making
me play tennis

01:05.067 --> 01:06.900
at the country club--again.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.533
- That's why I'm dressed
like a cabana boy.

01:09.633 --> 01:12.533
- I don't get it--your dad
is a retired supervillain.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.600
Why is Evil Man part of
a country club?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.867
- He thinks the family
hobnobbing with the rich

01:16.967 --> 01:18.133
is good for his mattress store.

01:18.233 --> 01:20.567
- Rich people
and their hobnobbing!

01:22.800 --> 01:25.267
- Oh, Link, you're blinding
me with all the white--

01:25.367 --> 01:27.133
the shirt, the shorts,

01:27.233 --> 01:29.333
the coconut popsicles
you call legs.

01:31.867 --> 01:34.533
Ah, much better.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.133
No, it's not.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.200
- Phoebe, I'm really sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.767
We can cover those babies right
up with some leg warmers.

01:44.867 --> 01:47.067
- Not my legs--the fact
that we can never hang out.

01:47.133 --> 01:49.067
- I know. We go to
different schools.

01:49.133 --> 01:50.900
We live in different towns.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.867
You're in a country
club, I'm not.

01:52.967 --> 01:56.067
- Wait. Maybe you could be.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.067
The club is having a doubles
tennis tournament

01:58.133 --> 02:00.100
and the winners get a free
one-year membership.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.600
- That's perfect.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.667
Then we could hang
out all the time.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.100
Luckily tennis is my jam.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.133
Well, tennis and leg warmers.
A-boh!

02:09.233 --> 02:10.467
- Well, great,
the tournament's tomorrow.

02:10.567 --> 02:13.700
Oh, but before I go...

02:13.800 --> 02:15.067
a little payback.

02:17.167 --> 02:20.600
MAX: Ow! Stretchy wedgie!

02:22.767 --> 02:24.900
- *

02:25.067 --> 02:26.167
* What you see

02:26.267 --> 02:27.600
* Is not what you get

02:27.700 --> 02:30.933
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:31.067 --> 02:32.700
* We fit right in

02:32.800 --> 02:34.133
* Bet you never guessed

02:34.233 --> 02:35.700
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:35.800 --> 02:37.300
* Just like all the rest

02:37.400 --> 02:39.067
* A picture
perfect family *

02:39.167 --> 02:41.167
* Is what we try to be

02:41.267 --> 02:42.333
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:42.433 --> 02:44.100
* The crazy things we do

02:44.200 --> 02:45.867
* This isn't
make believe *

02:45.967 --> 02:47.433
* It's our reality

02:47.533 --> 02:48.833
* Just your average family

02:48.933 --> 02:52.100
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:52.200 --> 02:55.767
* Livin' a double life

02:58.867 --> 03:00.100
- So, that's the plan.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.667
Link and I win the tournament
and I'm in the club.

03:01.767 --> 03:02.700
- Great plan.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.200
Only one, uh,
itsy-bitsy problem.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.833
You stink at tennis.

03:07.933 --> 03:09.567
- Yeah, but you don't.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.767
You won the Metroberg
Junior Open three times--

03:11.867 --> 03:14.300
Max Thunderslam.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.200
- No one's called me
that in years.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.333
- That's because you erased all
evidence of that old life.

03:20.433 --> 03:24.133
Except this!

03:24.233 --> 03:27.167
- Let me see! Let me see!

03:27.267 --> 03:29.700
Hey, Max, you have
another sister?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.567
- That's me.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.467
Phoebe, nobody can
see that picture.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.067
- I promise I'll delete it--

03:35.133 --> 03:37.233
if you help me and Link win.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.867
- Okay, fine.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.867
Besides, I hate those
fancy-pants country clubs.

03:40.967 --> 03:44.267
They literally make you
wear fancy pants.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.100
But how do you wanna cheat?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.767
- Well, okay, I am not cheating.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.967
I just need a few pointers.
I've already been practising.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.333
Whoa!

03:59.833 --> 04:01.600
- Oooh.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.267
- So let's talk cheating.

04:03.367 --> 04:09.067
- Aw, is our little man starting
another one of his businesses?

04:09.133 --> 04:11.200
- Uncle Billy's Lemonade.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.300
It's way better than
my other ideas.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.567
- Hey, if we lived
in Australia,

04:14.667 --> 04:18.533
Uncle Billy's Kangaroo Walking
woulda been huge.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.767
- And I still have one of Uncle
Billy's toothbrushes.

04:21.867 --> 04:24.867
- You mean Uncle Billy's Used
Toothbrushes.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.833
I'm just gonna...
I'll be right back.

04:30.833 --> 04:31.933
- Hey, Billy, the kid
down the street

04:32.067 --> 04:34.067
has a lemonade stand, too.

04:35.933 --> 04:39.533
- Yeah. When you buy a glass,
his dog does a flip for you.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.500
- But I am selling lemonade.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.400
Are you really?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.700
If you want to compete,

04:46.800 --> 04:49.867
you're gonna need
a hairy beast of your own.

04:49.967 --> 04:51.300
Luckily we have one.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.167
- No, Colosso.

04:55.267 --> 04:56.900
- Great idea.

04:57.067 --> 05:01.267
For that, you get a free
used toothbrush.

05:03.133 --> 05:07.333
- I found that one in one
of my sewer adventures.

05:07.433 --> 05:17.300
- *

05:17.400 --> 05:19.233
- So, wait, every day,
your country club

05:19.333 --> 05:20.800
has a giant tea party?

05:20.900 --> 05:22.933
- Yeah, it's called "High Tea."

05:23.067 --> 05:24.367
- Uh, no, it's called
"Princess Camp,"

05:24.467 --> 05:26.367
and I'm down!

05:26.467 --> 05:29.767
- To Princess Camp!
- Aha!

05:29.867 --> 05:33.133
- Ah, I can't wait for us
to win the Lacroix Cup.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.533
Then we can hang out every day.

05:34.633 --> 05:37.267
- You mean hobnob.

05:37.367 --> 05:40.900
That's right--I speak
country club.

05:41.067 --> 05:44.567
- This place is a lot more
fun with you around.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.800
- Phoebe. Link.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.833
Sandwiches.

05:48.933 --> 05:50.800
- Thanks for coming
to support, Max.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.800
- Just so you know--there is
a dress code at the club.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.800
- Hm, what's their stance
on wedgies?

05:56.933 --> 05:59.400
They're gonna like it like I am.

06:01.300 --> 06:06.067
- I'm just gonna go walk
this off before our match.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.567
- Charming, as always.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.200
Do you remember the plan?

06:09.300 --> 06:11.367
- Of course I do, because it
was my plan, Phoebe.

06:11.467 --> 06:12.833
Now let's get this over with.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.867
I can feel my pants getting
fancier by the second.

06:22.367 --> 06:23.767
- Back off, Alfred.

06:23.867 --> 06:27.067
I'm not buying one of
your snooty towels.

06:27.167 --> 06:28.700
- It's complementary.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.067
That means it's free.

06:31.167 --> 06:34.500
- Then I'll take them all!

06:34.600 --> 06:36.933
Just give 'em.

06:37.067 --> 06:41.667
- Well, you want me to pretend
to be a robotic talking bunny

06:41.767 --> 06:44.267
just so kids'll buy
your lemonade?

06:44.367 --> 06:45.533
- That's it.
- Yep.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.833
- Let's do it!

06:47.933 --> 06:51.167
And I've got a routine
I've been dying to try.

06:51.267 --> 06:54.100
Close your eyes.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.300
- Ooh, hammering the thing.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.900
Adding this now.

06:58.067 --> 07:02.067
And my nails.

07:02.167 --> 07:03.800
- And open 'em.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.600
Ta-da!

07:06.700 --> 07:08.433
- Whoa!

07:08.533 --> 07:09.733
What is he?

07:09.833 --> 07:12.400
- I'm The Great Colosso,

07:12.500 --> 07:15.200
Fortune teller extraordinaire!

07:15.300 --> 07:17.600
Billy, I'm sensing...

07:17.700 --> 07:21.067
you're gonna sell
a buttload of lemonade.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.433
- Awesome.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.633
But what if mom and dad
catch you talking to non

07:25.733 --> 07:27.667
- I'm sensing...

07:27.767 --> 07:30.567
that's your problem.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.400
- Billy, you spread the word

07:32.500 --> 07:35.467
and I'll distract
mom and dad.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.633
How could a game called
"Lawnmower" be fun?

07:39.733 --> 07:41.500
- Oh!

07:41.600 --> 07:43.067
We're mowin'.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.633
Oh, okay, so you're just
cuttin' the grass.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.133
Stay in the lines.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.367
- Ooh watch out for
that soccer ball!

07:49.467 --> 07:50.967
- Stop backseat mowing, Barb.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.533
- Don't worry.
They can't hear you.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.333
The game has them now.

08:00.767 --> 08:05.633
- I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.933
- Who has a yard shaped
like a unicorn?

08:08.067 --> 08:10.167
- You're mowing the roses!
You're mowing the roses!

08:10.267 --> 08:12.133
- Ah! Ha! Ha!

08:27.100 --> 08:29.733
- Wow, tennis really
is your jam.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.100
- It's all in his wrist,
er, the wrist.

08:40.567 --> 08:43.300
- You! Have good form,
young man.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.167
- No, it's not what you think.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.633
- Don't be modest--
it's not often a non-member

08:47.733 --> 08:50.600
knows how to boss around
the staff as well as I do.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.833
Raspberry iced tea!

08:53.933 --> 08:57.167
Theodore Lacroix.
- Max Thunderman.

08:57.267 --> 09:00.700
- Wait, Lacroix as
in the Lacroix Cup?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.300
- That's right.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.500
It's also the name of
the president of this club.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.400
Clear these plates!

09:08.433 --> 09:09.700
- Whoa.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.867
I am not in Dishville anymore.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.300
I don't know where Dishville is.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.700
But, here, people wait
on you hand and foot--

09:16.800 --> 09:20.067
which is how it should be.
Don't you agree?

09:20.133 --> 09:22.067
Silly straw!

09:24.067 --> 09:27.067
- It is how it should be.
- Mm-hm.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.800
- Denver Omelette!
- Nice!

09:30.900 --> 09:32.500
- Steel drum player!

09:32.600 --> 09:35.300
- Yeah!

09:40.800 --> 09:42.800
Max?

09:42.900 --> 09:45.500
Pay attention.
- Sorry.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.700
- Raspberry iced tea!

09:52.800 --> 09:55.100
- Match!

09:55.200 --> 09:56.667
- Mr. Evilman
and Miss Thunderman,

09:56.767 --> 09:58.700
you advance to the finals.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.167
- BOTH: Mwah!

10:02.667 --> 10:05.700
- Well, I see mattress boy has
teamed up with quite a pro.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.167
- Looks like I might have to

10:07.267 --> 10:09.100
take the cover off
my racquet today.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.333
- Oh, I didn't know
you were playing.

10:11.433 --> 10:12.800
- Of course.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.800
It's a shame I didn't
meet you sooner, Max.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.833
You're club material--

10:16.933 --> 10:18.833
unlike the loser
I'm playing with.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.100
- Wake up, Senator!

10:21.200 --> 10:23.100
- Good luck out there,
Mr. Lacroix.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.300
- Thank you, Max.
Sports drink!

10:28.167 --> 10:30.667
- You know what this
celebration needs?

10:30.767 --> 10:35.300
Pecan sandies.
Be right back.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.400
- What a waste of evil DNA.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.300
I nearly lost out there.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.767
I brought you here to cheat,
not start a steel drum band.

10:44.867 --> 10:47.533
- I was talking to
the club president--this guy.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.100
Lacroix, he's so cool.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.500
- Hey, why are you even
bothering making friends?

10:51.600 --> 10:53.333
You're only here
for the day.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.867
- Max, what...what
are you doing?

11:02.833 --> 11:05.467
- Man down! My man is down!

11:05.567 --> 11:06.633
- I can sub for him.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.467
- Max! Good show!

11:09.567 --> 11:10.900
- Excuse me, Thunderslam,

11:11.067 --> 11:12.967
you're supposed to help me
win the free membership.

11:13.067 --> 11:16.767
- Sorry, Phoebe, but it turns
out I love country club life.

11:16.867 --> 11:19.067
And one day of it
is not enough.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.767
- Wait, the Senator is okay.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.467
- Never mind.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.967
- That membership is mine.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.867
Trampin' steel drum music!

11:47.233 --> 11:50.800
- JUDGE: Match.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.800
- Mr. Lacroix
and Mr. Thunderman,

11:53.900 --> 11:55.733
you advance to the finals.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.933
- BOTH: Yeah!

11:58.067 --> 12:00.833
- Buh-bye.
- Bye.

12:00.933 --> 12:04.567
- See you later.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.100
- Why are you doing
this to me?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.967
You know I wanna spend
more time with Link.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.700
I thought you hated
country club people.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.200
- I did.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.067
- Mr. Lacroix sent
over a complementary

12:13.167 --> 12:15.233
tennis elbow massage.
- But now I don't.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.600
I thought I was gonna
have to take over the world

12:20.700 --> 12:22.067
to live like a king.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.600
It turns out I just had
to join this country club.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.600
- Jasmine Mint
or Coconut Lavender?

12:26.700 --> 12:28.233
- Both.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.167
- All right, well,
the joke is on you

12:30.267 --> 12:32.100
because after you
double-crossed me,

12:32.200 --> 12:34.133
I posted that tennis pic of
you all over the internet.

12:34.233 --> 12:38.600
- Max, I can't believe this
picture of you going around.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.067
Lookin' smart, Thunderslam.

12:41.133 --> 12:42.500
- Thanks, Mr. Lacroix.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.733
- Cool mist!

12:44.833 --> 12:48.133
Yes! Yes...

12:48.233 --> 12:49.900
- All right, fine, live
it up while you can,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.600
Tennis the Menace,
'cause I just came up with

12:51.700 --> 12:55.700
the most diabolical plan that
is gonna make you beg for mercy.

12:55.800 --> 12:56.967
- You don't have
a plan, do you?

12:57.067 --> 12:59.467
- I do not, but I will
see you in court.

12:59.567 --> 13:01.067
- You mean on the court.

13:01.167 --> 13:02.600
- You're not better than me.
- I am at tennis.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.133
- Stop engaging me!

13:05.233 --> 13:08.267
- She's having a bad day.

13:08.367 --> 13:14.667
- *

13:14.767 --> 13:17.700
- Greetings!
I've been expecting you.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.200
I'm sensing...

13:19.300 --> 13:22.533
a birthday in the near
or distant future.

13:22.633 --> 13:27.100
So sayeth The Great Colosso!

13:27.200 --> 13:29.900
- He's right.
This is amazing.

13:30.067 --> 13:32.833
- No, the robot bunny.

13:32.933 --> 13:37.767
Who cares about the lemonade?

13:37.867 --> 13:41.333
- Uncle Billy's Lemonade
is an epic fail.

13:41.433 --> 13:44.267
Look at all these kids.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.767
And mom and dad
don't have a clue.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.733
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- The grass is too high.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.367
- Use the turbo blade.
- I can.

13:51.467 --> 13:53.200
- Win the game!

13:56.333 --> 13:58.900
- All I wanted was for one
of my ideas to make money.

13:59.067 --> 14:01.133
- Your idea is making money.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.400
And I've got a wad
of cash that says so.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.900
Listen...

14:05.067 --> 14:09.133
Your idea's makin' money.

14:09.233 --> 14:13.333
- My idea was the lemonade,
not fortune telling.

14:13.433 --> 14:16.767
This is all you and Colosso.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.100
- But we're making bunny money.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.800
Bunny money!

14:21.900 --> 14:26.667
- *

14:26.767 --> 14:28.300
- You were right.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.167
I dropped the Lacroix name
and the pro shop set me up.

14:31.267 --> 14:33.800
And so did the restaurant.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.167
Steak on a stick!

14:36.267 --> 14:37.733
- You're not done yet.

14:37.833 --> 14:41.600
When we win, you are
gonna need this.

14:43.933 --> 14:46.900
- Whoa, it has my name on it.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.433
- This jacket comes
with great power, Max.

14:49.533 --> 14:53.800
Observe...

14:53.900 --> 14:56.200
See?

14:56.300 --> 14:58.533
- I promise to wield
the power responsibly.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.533
It's not like
the rest of us do.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.067
Oh! Oh!

15:04.167 --> 15:06.400
Oh...
follow the jacket.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.367
This never gets old.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.533
- Almost there, almost there.

15:10.633 --> 15:12.133
No.

15:12.233 --> 15:15.133
- The grass just
keeps growing.

15:15.233 --> 15:16.333
- I need it back, Hank.

15:16.433 --> 15:19.100
- That's fine. I got this.
- I need it back!

15:22.200 --> 15:23.567
- No-o-o-o-o-o!

15:27.367 --> 15:30.067
- I'm so sorry, Barb.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.267
- Oh, no, it's probably
for the best.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.467
We haven't seen
the kids all day.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.467
- Oh, my gosh, that's right.
We have kids!

15:40.333 --> 15:43.167
- Aw, look at our little man's
lemonade business.

15:43.267 --> 15:45.533
It's a success.
- Oh, hey, guys.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.600
Oh, don't tell me
he's a fortune teller.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.067
- Okay, I won't tell you.

15:51.100 --> 15:55.167
- Hey, why don't you come back
when the line's not so long.

15:55.267 --> 15:57.933
- You can go in front of me.
This is my fifth time.

15:58.067 --> 16:01.133
- Oh, aren't you sweet.

16:01.233 --> 16:05.600
You'd better sleep
with one eye open.

16:05.700 --> 16:09.767
- Who calls upon
The Great Coloss--ahhhh!

16:13.100 --> 16:17.067
- Okay, everyone,
the robot bunny's broken.

16:17.133 --> 16:18.900
Run for your life!

16:21.067 --> 16:23.333
People can't know we have
a talking bunny.

16:23.433 --> 16:26.800
- I was just trying to help
the lemonade stand make money--

16:26.900 --> 16:29.300
to share with you guys.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.067
- Well, how much
are we talkin'?

16:31.133 --> 16:32.833
- Hank! She's trying
to bribe you.

16:32.933 --> 16:36.067
You can't buy yourself out
of this, young lady.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.133
- Wait!

16:38.233 --> 16:40.533
I'm the young lady
you're mad at.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.200
- Don't be mad at Nora.
This is all my idea.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.433
- BARB & HANK:
Really?

16:47.533 --> 16:49.433
- BILLY: Really.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.700
- Well, Uncle Billy,
you're gonna have plenty of time

16:51.800 --> 16:55.233
to come up with new ideas
while you're grounded.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.600
- Oh.

16:58.933 --> 17:01.700
"Lawnmower II: Blades of Fury"!

17:01.800 --> 17:04.100
- We have something
to do right now,

17:04.200 --> 17:05.867
but when we get back...

17:05.967 --> 17:07.667
this better be cleaned up!

17:07.767 --> 17:09.500
- HANK: Oh!

17:11.167 --> 17:13.733
- I don't get it.
Why'd you take the blame?

17:13.833 --> 17:16.433
- I finally came up with
a money-making idea.

17:16.533 --> 17:19.567
Uncle Billy's
"Blame It On Billy."

17:19.667 --> 17:22.700
I take the blame
and your money.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.833
Five dollars, please?

17:26.500 --> 17:29.133
I'm gonna give you ten!

17:29.233 --> 17:32.067
I broke mom's favorite
vase yesterday.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.433
- No, no, Nora,
Uncle Billy

17:34.533 --> 17:38.533
broke mom's favorite
vase yesterday.

17:38.633 --> 17:43.100
- *

17:46.733 --> 17:48.667
- Senator down!

17:48.767 --> 17:53.833
- *

17:58.167 --> 18:04.333
- *

18:07.967 --> 18:13.767
- *

18:17.567 --> 18:19.933
- Whoa!

18:20.067 --> 18:23.067
- *

18:28.067 --> 18:30.300
- LINK: Time out.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.433
Phoebe, are you using
your powers?

18:34.533 --> 18:37.633
- Pffft. Just my power serve.

18:37.733 --> 18:40.067
Okay, maybe I'm using
my powers a little.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.500
But Max is doing it, too.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.767
I know.
He just pants'd me.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.667
- Look, I'm sorry.

18:49.767 --> 18:52.700
Like the truth is I am
horrible at tennis.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.400
I just wanted to win so I could
join the country club.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.200
- Well, I wanna hang out
with you more, too,

18:56.300 --> 18:57.967
but you shouldn't have
to cheat to do it.

18:58.067 --> 18:59.533
- Oh, I know. This was wrong.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.767
You know what? Can we just
finish the game the right way?

19:01.867 --> 19:03.300
- I'd like that.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.933
They do have match point,
but...who knows?

19:05.067 --> 19:07.067
- Hey, I don't need
superpowers to win.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.633
Time in.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.133
Good always defeats evil.
- Nothing can stop us.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.567
- PHOEBE: Hey. Hey.

19:12.667 --> 19:15.700
- Ooh! Ooh!

19:18.500 --> 19:20.700
- Except Thunderslam.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.067
- The winners of
the Lacroix Cup--

19:22.133 --> 19:25.067
Mr. Lacroix
and Mr. Thunderman.

19:26.567 --> 19:31.467
- BOTH: Oooh! Oooh! Oooh!
Yea-a-a-a-h!

19:31.567 --> 19:35.100
- Yes! I'm a member!
The world is mine!

19:35.200 --> 19:37.933
- Congratulations.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.233
- Congratulations, gentlemen.
On behalf of all of us...

19:40.333 --> 19:42.333
- Give me that!

19:44.200 --> 19:46.233
Bow to me, country club
employees.

19:46.333 --> 19:50.767
Bow to your new member.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.933
Drummer boy,
celebration music!

20:01.733 --> 20:03.367
Ahhhh!

20:05.867 --> 20:08.633
- You are acting in an
incredibly ugly manner--

20:08.733 --> 20:12.133
quite frankly, not befitting
a member of our club.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.067
- Like you can do
anything about it.

20:14.167 --> 20:17.233
Now how about a victory lap?

20:17.333 --> 20:19.567
Ah, ride, preppy!

20:19.667 --> 20:22.067
- I most certainly will not!

20:22.167 --> 20:23.900
- Uh-huh, you will.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.733
I'm Max Thunderman, best friend
of president Lacroix.

20:26.833 --> 20:30.033
- That's impossible.
I'm president Lacroix.

20:31.867 --> 20:34.267
- Oh...

20:34.367 --> 20:37.267
Then, uh, who's that guy?

20:37.367 --> 20:41.567
- Ooh, game, set,
match, Lacroix.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.133
- That's my brother.
He's president--

20:44.233 --> 20:46.700
of sleeping on my couch.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.067
Two weeks has
lasted two years!

20:50.167 --> 20:53.033
- I'm tryin' to figure
things out!

20:53.133 --> 20:55.000
- Security, get him
out of here.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.700
- Yeah, you're right.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
We can't have people eatin'
out of the garbage

20:58.900 --> 21:00.900
at our country club.

21:01.067 --> 21:02.900
- I meant you.

21:03.067 --> 21:05.433
And take his jacket.
- Ah, no, no!

21:05.533 --> 21:08.667
Not my jacket!

21:11.233 --> 21:13.767
No! No!

21:20.967 --> 21:26.767
- *

21:26.867 --> 21:28.867
- Goin' out with Link
again, huh?

21:28.967 --> 21:30.500
Is he still mad at me?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.967
- Why don't you ask
him yourself?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.967
- Now he's over it.

21:43.067 --> 21:46.233
- Max, I told you not to
leave your dishes out.

21:47.733 --> 21:51.333
Max didn't do it,
Uncle Billy did.

21:51.433 --> 21:53.200
- Billy, what's gotten
into you lately?

21:53.300 --> 21:55.500
No TV again tonight.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.667
- A pleasure doing
business with you.

22:00.767 --> 22:04.767
- Stick with me, Uncle Billy.
I'll make you a very rich man.

22:10.800 --> 22:26.067
- *
