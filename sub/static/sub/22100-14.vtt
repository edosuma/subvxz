00:01.418 --> 00:04.003
APOLLO: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.173
The world is frakked.
It's upside down

00:07.257 --> 00:08.841
and somebody's gotta
turn it right side up.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.593
Are you that man?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.178
I'm one of them.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.182
Combat, Gaeta.

00:16.266 --> 00:19.394
We've got civilians
arming themselves down here.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.313
Gaeta!

00:22.398 --> 00:23.690
Sergeant of the Guards,
get your marines in here!

00:23.774 --> 00:25.024
Nobody gets in or out!

00:25.109 --> 00:26.359
What the hell are you doing?

00:26.443 --> 00:29.779
Admiral Adama, I am removing
you from command of this ship.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.531
Admiral, don't do this.

00:31.615 --> 00:35.868
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let a
guy like you run me off my own ship.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.832
The Colonel and I
are gonna make sure

00:40.916 --> 00:43.000
that the President's Raptor
gets out of here safely.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.544
No, Dad, you can't stay here... Admiral.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.129
I'm depending on you.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.424
Make sure these animals
don't dishonor this ship.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.307
I'll see you soon.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.114
MARINE: Look out!

01:19.830 --> 01:22.582
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.335
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target and destroy.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.550
NARCHO: Narcho, Galactica.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.676
Hostile Raptor outbound.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.095
Bearing six,
three, four at two.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.431
Order your flight to engage
the target and destroy.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.183
NARCHO: Roger, Galactica.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.692
(GRUNTING)

01:55.657 --> 01:56.657
(GROANS)

01:57.451 --> 02:01.579
Well, well, well...
It's the brig rat.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.625
Admiral.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.964
NARCHO: Galactica, Narcho.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.382
Blind out of the sixth gate.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.510
Breaking, going Zone 5
to pursue.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.053
Red Viper II, Narcho.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.514
The target's in your
front yard, Hotdog. Engage.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.058
Narcho, Hotdog, tally.
I got her.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.893
HOTDOG: Colonial Raptor,
Red Viper ll.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.436
Identify yourself immediately.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.604
Repeat, identify.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.732
Hotdog, dig the crap out of
your ears. Engage and destroy!

02:29.817 --> 02:32.777
Narcho, Hotdog. Target in
range. Waiting for Raptor ID.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.820
Damn it, Hotdog.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.613
Galactica, Narcho,
coming around.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.825
Bearing niner, three, four.
Still no joy.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.409
Hotdog, Narcho.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.036
Destroy the target
or disengage.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.914
I repeat, destroy
the target or disengage.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.916
Where's the... Where?

02:48.252 --> 02:49.585
This is
President Laura Roslin

02:49.670 --> 02:52.004
aboard the Raptor.
Do not fire.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.130
Gage, jam her transmission.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.633
I escaped from the mutineers
who have taken over Galactica.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.510
Gage!
ROSLIN: They're firing...

02:57.594 --> 02:59.178
Grabbed it, sir.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.266
They're still on us.
Sit down and hang on.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.893
Hotdog, Narcho.
Target status, report.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.228
I don't know.
That was the President.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.604
She's on board the target.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.483
We've got Adama and Tigh.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.360
They were in
the auxiliary airlock.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.613
Put Tigh and Adama down
with the Cylon prisoners.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.366
Belay that.
Put Tigh with the Cylons.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.368
Bring Adama up here now.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.870
Understood.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.083
Vireem,
patch me through to Red II.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.879
Lieutenant Constanza,
Galactica Actual.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.631
You were given an order,
now follow it.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.635
Hotdog, stop frakking thinking
and shoot, Gods damn it!

03:39.970 --> 03:43.014
Galactica, Narcho, tally.
I have the target.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.724
Maneuvering into position.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.850
Frak, Narcho!

03:45.976 --> 03:47.059
I'm in, I'm in.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.646
They've got
a missile lock on us.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.909
Missiles missed the target.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.827
The Raptor boarded
the Baseship.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.630
Why are we under attack? Colonial
Vipers are firing on our ship.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.840
You're not under attack,
they're firing at us.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.008
What did you do?

04:19.092 --> 04:20.509
Their government
has lost control.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.511
Our government has
not lost control.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.764
Excuse me, how would you
describe it, Madam President?

04:24.848 --> 04:27.934
Adama is a fugitive.
Gaeta has an army,

04:28.018 --> 04:29.936
and Zarek has control
of Colonial One.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.354
Adama is free.
Don't listen to him.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.688
The last time we saw Adama,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.774
he was cornered in an
airlock with Colonel Tigh.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.777
If you were forced to escape, Gaeta
and Zarek must have substantial support.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.028
They don't!

04:39.112 --> 04:42.615
In fact, we're here because a pilot
refused to shoot us down. Tell him.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.159
Yes, but the other
pilot had no qualms

04:45.243 --> 04:47.078
about shooting down the
President of the Colonies.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.204
If they're
willing to do that...

04:48.288 --> 04:50.081
It's not safe. We have to jump. No.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.165
I have to agree.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.333
Well,
what about the Final Four?

04:52.417 --> 04:55.169
Tyrol, Anders, Tigh, they're
still over there. What about them?

04:55.253 --> 04:57.505
If you jump,
you'll never see them again.

04:57.589 --> 05:01.050
If you stay put, you give
Adama a chance to save them.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.303
Put your ship in
the middle of the Fleet.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.805
Use the Fleet for cover.

05:05.889 --> 05:06.889
Give Adama some time.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.891
But what if... No, Gaeta
won't jeopardize the Fleet.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.019
He doesn't have the guts!
Now, come on, do it!

05:18.735 --> 05:20.236
Welcome back.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.906
I had a feeling you
wouldn't be on that Raptor.

05:24.658 --> 05:29.912
I care too much for this ship
to let it be overrun by rats.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.622
Right.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.751
If only you cared as much
about the people on it.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.796
You have no frakkin' idea.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.256
Well then, show me.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.924
You want to save some lives?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.843
Get on the radio
and call Roslin.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.012
Tell her to come back
and surrender.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.179
No.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.933
I'll ask you one
more time, Admiral.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.393
"Admiral"?

05:53.603 --> 05:54.854
Admiral.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.775
You're the Admiral now.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.446
So you call up Roslin.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.116
Make her laugh.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.251
All hands to battle stations.
Set Condition 1.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.046
Gun battery, stand by.
Target bearing...

06:20.130 --> 06:22.173
Sir. The Baseship.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.265
They're moving
into the Fleet.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.727
They're hiding in the Fleet.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.606
Battle stations, stand down.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.861
Marine launch, blue squadron.
Have them quarantine the Baseship.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.238
Gage, spin up our FTL.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.240
Alert the ship captains
to do the same.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.786
Kelly, prepare for
Mr. Zarek's arrival.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.793
Now you're going to
shoot me, Mr. Gaeta.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
(THEME MUSIC)

07:55.725 --> 07:56.934
"... shall we save the kids?"

07:57.018 --> 07:59.728
And the attorney says,
"Frak them. "

07:59.813 --> 08:02.148
And the priest says,
"Do we have time?"

08:02.232 --> 08:03.691

08:06.903 --> 08:08.404

Damn it.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.916
This is
President Laura Roslin.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.587
This is

08:26.256 --> 08:28.174
Hello. Hello!

08:46.693 --> 08:49.320
It's okay,
he's going to feel better.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.615
Wonder what Gaeta's gonna do.

08:53.575 --> 08:57.244
In your case, cut off
one of your frakkin' legs.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.124
GAETA: I have a net over
the Baseship, you know.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.127
You didn't have to bring
the whole Quorum with you.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.004
If you're insisting
on the trial.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.714
I'm insisting.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.426
Then I want them where I
can keep an eye on them.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.721
Look, I know you want
to do the right thing.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.182
Oh, I'm sorry. I was under the
impression that you did, too.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.392
I do. But we need to move on.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.395
We can't move on until people have
answered for what they've done.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.481
Which begins with Adama.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.525
One world at a time, Tom.

I don't suppose anyone's
gonna feed my dog.

desertion,

10:06.398 --> 10:10.150
giving aid and comfort to the
enemy and gross dereliction of duty.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.779
The punishment for these
crimes is death by firing squad.

ZAREK: The Admiral is entitled
to a court-martial.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.166
We need a lawyer to
handle his defense.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.547
They need a pimp.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.511
Commander Gaeta will
represent the people.

Commander Gaeta...

10:41.808 --> 10:43.726
Why are you doing this?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.228
For justice.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.398
LAMPKIN: Justice. Uh-huh.

10:50.025 --> 10:54.903
So it'd be fair to assume
that should I choose to pass

10:54.988 --> 10:58.407
on this field trip
for justice,

10:59.075 --> 11:03.162
Winkin' and Blinkin' over there will
use me instead for target practice?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.331
Just get on with your job.

11:05.749 --> 11:06.749
Hmm.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.002
Fine.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.755
Bring in the judges.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.216
I will be serving as judge.

11:16.301 --> 11:20.054
I see, so we've run out
of ship's captains, then.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.181
Captains are too busy
protecting their vessels

11:22.265 --> 11:26.185
from the Cylon Baseship Admiral
Adama welcomed into their fleet.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.437
Shove it up your ass.

I don't need
a frakking lawyer.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.735
...desertion,
with giving comfort

11:34.819 --> 11:36.028
and aid to the enemy.
This is a joke.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.446
And you will
answer for these crimes.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.532
"Aid and comfort," oh, yeah.
I did bathe and wash them.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.992
Made their meals.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.494
I love the enemy.

11:43.578 --> 11:47.206
Could I have a few minutes
with Mr. Adama?

11:47.290 --> 11:50.709
Just to impress upon him
the gravity of these charges?

11:50.794 --> 11:52.044
Please?

11:52.128 --> 11:54.963
You want him to understand,
I know you do.

the protection of the Fleet.

he's that someone.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.233
To take command and destroy our
enemies before they destroy us.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.570
What've you done?

15:04.654 --> 15:06.989
This is what happens.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.992
No...

15:10.618 --> 15:12.160
No, it's a lie.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.038
This is all based on lies.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.251
Don't you get it?

15:20.670 --> 15:23.213
We had the truth
on our side. Now...

15:23.840 --> 15:25.007
Now...

15:27.927 --> 15:30.846
The truth is told by
whoever's left standing.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.641
Adama has to go.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.186
There's no turning back now.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.900
(GRUNTING)

16:03.212 --> 16:08.967
Sorry. It was a difficult
choice but we made our decision.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.139
We're jumping away.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.605
We have a chance to survive.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.192
I'm sorry, I would've thought
as one of the Final Five,

16:25.276 --> 16:27.944
you'd have a broader vision
than that.

16:29.072 --> 16:33.575
If he hasn't done it already, Gaeta
will airlock Tigh, Tyrol, Anders,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.702
then he'll start
with the rest.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.329
Kara, Helo, Adama...

16:37.413 --> 16:38.789
Don't. Stop.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.708
His fate has been all
but decided, count on it.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.669
Please, don't.
Ours isn't yet.

16:43.753 --> 16:44.795
No.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.591
No one believed that we would
survive the Cylon nuclear holocaust,

16:49.676 --> 16:51.677
or the hell on New Caprica,

16:51.761 --> 16:55.097
or the 50,000 other crises
we've lived through.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.515
But we did, we're here.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.643
We've made this veritable
habit out of defying the odds,

16:59.727 --> 17:01.311
particularly William Adama.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.355
And he is alive.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.857
He is alive.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.694
And he will take command
of this fleet again.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.488
And when that day comes,
he's gonna know

17:12.490 --> 17:14.825
who stuck with him
and who ran.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.910
Now who do you want to be?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.204
Who do you want to be?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.373
(GRUNTING)

17:23.793 --> 17:25.168
KELLY: Hey, Chief.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.503
(GROANS)

17:27.463 --> 17:29.131
Looking for a gun?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.133
Hey, Aaron.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.469
Sprung you, did they?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.681
Long live the revolution.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.849
Out.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.560
Just shoot me now.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.395
I'm too frakking
tired to get out.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.939
You're a frakking machine.
Get out.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.817
That's right, I'm a machine.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.236
What does that make you?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.530
Dumbass?

17:56.951 --> 17:59.161
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:03.958 --> 18:05.333

18:16.679 --> 18:18.930
This was a hell
of a ship once.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.517
Yeah, it really was.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.357
Heard your kid's
not a Cylon.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.278
Could have told you
she was trouble.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.362
(LAUGHING)

18:36.199 --> 18:37.407
Thanks.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.203
It wouldn't have mattered.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.050
Go on, keep going. Go!

18:55.134 --> 18:57.803
Go on, skin job, go!

19:05.561 --> 19:06.728
Frak!

19:14.111 --> 19:18.657
Forget it. You think if
you can get me to cooperate,

19:18.741 --> 19:21.910
you'll get a pat on the back
instead of a bullet?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.913
Don't let your pride
get in the way.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.998
Put your innocence
on record for the Fleet.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.751
Your statement...
I won't do a statement.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.295
Gaeta and Zarek
are gonna fail.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.923
You really believe that?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.883
What do you think?

19:38.803 --> 19:42.556
I won't betray my beliefs
with a testimony.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.019
You have people out there
mobilizing, I saw them.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.690
Give them a chance to do
something. Stall or play dumb...

19:52.775 --> 19:55.652
We've been ready to
proceed for some time.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.495
(GRUNTS)

20:14.630 --> 20:16.298
Are you injured?

20:17.466 --> 20:19.801
I believe
the word is "damaged. "

20:34.650 --> 20:37.319
No frakking way.
It's never gonna work.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.905
Up close, I can take two of
them before you take your shots.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.907
From back here,
with a side arm?

20:41.991 --> 20:44.075
We've only got one
chance to get this right.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.036
And I'm gonna take it.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.499
MARINE 1: Grenade! MARINE

21:10.311 --> 21:12.103
Never pulled the pin.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.230
Not funny.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.566
Yeah, it would have been
if you'd thought of it.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.152
No. Not funny.

21:27.662 --> 21:28.620
Tigh.
It's okay.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.829
It's Kara.

21:29.914 --> 21:30.997
It's Lee and Kara.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.208
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where is he?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.292
ATHENA: Give me a hand.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.543
Bastards went
to town on Helo.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.920
Wait a minute. Where is he?
Where is my father?

21:37.004 --> 21:37.963
Kelly took him.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.756
What? You were with him.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.799
What happened?

21:40.883 --> 21:41.883
I don't frakking know!

21:41.968 --> 21:45.136
Come on, damn it. Let's get
out of here before they find us.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.471
I have Hera.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.847
You okay?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.106
ATHENA: Go left.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.276
Kara, frak that, let's go!

22:00.361 --> 22:01.945
Got it, we'll catch up.

22:05.741 --> 22:06.866
Sam!

22:08.077 --> 22:09.077

Oh, my Gods!

22:24.301 --> 22:26.511
Look at me, look at me.
Look at me, do you hear me?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.054
Okay, okay, okay.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.015
Kara! We can't stay here!

22:30.099 --> 22:32.350
Here.
Watch his neck, Gods damn it.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.811
We got to go!
We got to move Sam.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.688
Take Hera and go
to Baltar's people.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.024
No one wants to go near those
nut jobs. You'll be safe there.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.734
Okay, he's gonna bleed out.
He's gonna go.

22:40.818 --> 22:41.860
Don't move his head.
Go!

22:41.944 --> 22:44.154
I can take care of myself.
I won't leave.

22:44.238 --> 22:47.615
Saul! We're gonna lose Sam! Lee, go!

22:47.700 --> 22:50.118
Lee, go, get your father!
Now go.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.203
Go!

22:53.164 --> 22:55.081
Okay, get him to Cottle.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.207

move out!

Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.055
(PANTING)

23:13.309 --> 23:15.977
You deserted us on New Caprica.
You let us twist in the wind.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.771
I saved your frakking ass.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.105
Why can't you just admit

23:19.190 --> 23:21.232
that you've been derelict
in your duties as an officer?

23:21.317 --> 23:23.109
Not only do you give aid
and comfort to the enemy,

23:23.194 --> 23:24.277
you were about to
grant them access...

23:24.403 --> 23:26.321
Objection, he's badgering the
witness. ... to every jump drive

23:26.405 --> 23:27.405
on every ship in this fleet.

23:27.490 --> 23:30.700
About to? I did it.
I gave them access.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.704
ADAMA: And you know what? I
didn't give them aid and comfort.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.539
They gave it to me.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.501
MAN: We just got word that
Tigh and the skin jobs escaped.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.795
Don't worry, sir.
We're on it.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.515
Um...

23:53.599 --> 23:56.935
Saul Tigh was killed
trying to escape.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.197
I'm sorry.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.245
But you did give aid
and comfort to the enemy.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.205
Saul Tigh was a Cylon.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.207
And even when you
discovered that he was,

24:19.291 --> 24:21.876
you let him remain the XO,
didn't you?

24:25.506 --> 24:29.050
I'm not answering any more
questions for you, Mr. Gaeta.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.012
The prisoner is
guilty as charged.

This is an asylum.

Felix Gaeta has
seized Galactica by force.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.534
The Cylons were
defending themselves.

They will not harm you.

I repeat,

still broadcasting?

ships' captains...

25:01.000 --> 25:02.375
Where's Hoshi?
... not to jump.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.043
Get that little frak back
into CIC. Do not jump!

Shut down your FTL drives...

25:20.352 --> 25:23.062
It worked.
They couldn't jam it.

make you feel better.

I ran again.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.795
Surrender.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.631
You have five minutes!

32:02.754 --> 32:04.505
Lieutenant Allison.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.216
Carry out the execution.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.387
Yes, sir.

32:12.848 --> 32:13.848
(GRUNTS)

32:14.141 --> 32:15.850
Dad.
Thank you, Son.

32:24.651 --> 32:25.735
They told me you were dead.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.862
For a while, I was, Bill.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.251
I want to take back my ship.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.343
Lieutenant...

32:50.886 --> 32:52.261
Sorry, sir.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.640
I've always respected you.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.184
But I hate the Cylons.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.896
And I can't take orders from
a leader who won't fight them.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.731
Colonel. Stand down.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.912
Tie him up.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.088
(GRUNTS)

33:39.935 --> 33:41.602
Put me on speaker.

33:46.566 --> 33:50.236
This is Tom Zarek,
President of the 12 Colonies.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.446
It's over, Laura.

33:53.615 --> 33:56.409
Saul Tigh was killed
attempting to escape.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.622
Bill Adama was tried and
found guilty of his crimes.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.961
A firing squad
executed him this morning.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.964
It's done, Laura.

34:11.258 --> 34:15.302
You need to think about the people
of this fleet now and surrender.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.352
No.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.816
Not now, not ever.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.026
Do you hear me?

34:31.111 --> 34:35.072
I will use every cannon,

34:35.157 --> 34:40.077
every bomb, every bullet,
every weapon I have

34:40.162 --> 34:43.289
down to my own eyeteeth
to end you.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.332
I swear it!

34:46.168 --> 34:48.502
I'm coming for all of you!

34:59.556 --> 35:02.683
So now we have a military leader
and a president, all in one.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.771
And how would you have answered
her, if you would have been here?

35:07.022 --> 35:09.315
Baseship's arming itself,
sir.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.276
Are we jump ready?
Affirmative.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.361
Set the rendezvous
jump coordinates.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.864
Set your board to green.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.951
There's been enough killing.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.871
I'm leaving them behind
unless you object.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.061
(PANTING)

35:50.482 --> 35:55.694
ROSLIN: Galactica, this is
President Laura Roslin. Surrender.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.492
Gods damn it.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.412
Sir, board is green.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.747
Count it down.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.251
Jump in 10...

36:11.586 --> 36:12.795
Nine...

36:14.089 --> 36:15.339
Eight...

36:16.299 --> 36:17.299
(GRUNTS)

36:18.885 --> 36:20.094
Six...

36:21.763 --> 36:23.055
Five...

36:25.392 --> 36:26.600
Four...

36:27.644 --> 36:28.936
Three...

36:30.063 --> 36:31.939
FTL just went offline.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.274
(BEEPING)

36:36.069 --> 36:37.444
Get a crew.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.447
Get someone down to the
engine room right now.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.449
Come on, move it!

36:42.701 --> 36:45.411
Gaeta.
Gaeta, launch your birds.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.746
Gaeta, wake up.
What the frak are you doing?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.498
Launch your birds!

36:53.295 --> 36:55.838
Gaeta. Gaeta, we have to
defend, do you understand that?

36:55.922 --> 36:58.799
Do you understand?
Gaeta, we need to defend!

36:58.967 --> 37:01.844
"One day soon, there's
gonna be a reckoning. "

37:02.721 --> 37:05.347
Gun batteries have fixed target
bearing. Standing by to fire.

37:05.432 --> 37:08.142
Gaeta, what the frak
is wrong with you?

37:08.643 --> 37:09.894
Wake up!

37:11.688 --> 37:13.188
Weapons hold!

37:20.155 --> 37:21.822
Give me a weapon.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.118
MARINE 1: Put your weapons
down! Put your weapons down!

37:26.202 --> 37:27.244
MARINE 2: Drop your weapons!

37:27.329 --> 37:28.287
Put them down, now!

37:28.371 --> 37:29.371
Drop them, drop them!

37:29.456 --> 37:30.456
On your knees!

37:30.540 --> 37:31.749
Move it!

37:33.001 --> 37:34.084
Now!

37:41.509 --> 37:42.843
Connect me
with the President.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.553
Right away, Admiral.

37:47.724 --> 37:50.017
Madam President.
This is the Admiral.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.477
Stand down.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.940
I repeat, Galactica's secured.
Stand down.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.858
Bill.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.350
(PANTING)

38:44.906 --> 38:46.156
Oh, no.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.272
(SOBS)

39:51.306 --> 39:54.808
GAETA: I suppose a long time
ago, it was architecture.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.815
There was a year there where I
scribbled floor plans on everything.

40:02.817 --> 40:06.487
Dining room table,
patio tiles, rare books,

40:06.571 --> 40:08.489
drove my parents crazy.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.493
BALTAR: How old were you?

40:13.286 --> 40:15.996
I don't know, eight, maybe?
Nine?

40:18.333 --> 40:19.625
(CHUCKLES)

40:19.709 --> 40:24.171
I'll tell you one thing, though, I
had some pretty frakking amazing ideas.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.510
Restaurants shaped like food.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.178
Huh?

40:33.640 --> 40:35.724
And top-heavy buildings,
and stairways, every...

40:35.809 --> 40:38.268
Everything had to
have a stairway.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.655
Spoils of war.

40:51.699 --> 40:57.287
(SIGHS) When I was older,
then it became medicine,

40:57.372 --> 41:00.624
and then engineering,
photography.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.878
I think I would've made a better
architect than any of those, though.

41:05.713 --> 41:09.258
And then, I discovered
science. And I...

41:10.844 --> 41:13.720
I thought I was really,
really good at it.

41:14.347 --> 41:15.973
Until I met you.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.025
Felix...
Don't.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.740
And please, no religion.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.083
I'm fine with how things
have worked out.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.210
Really, Gaius, I am. I...

41:54.762 --> 41:57.306
I just hope... I hope that

41:59.976 --> 42:04.688
people realize eventually

42:08.276 --> 42:09.610
who I am.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.489
I know who you are, Felix.

42:18.328 --> 42:20.120
I know who you are.

42:47.857 --> 42:49.066
(SIGHS)

42:49.984 --> 42:51.151
Ready.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.325
Aim.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.415
It stopped.

43:06.209 --> 43:07.334
Fire.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.465
