WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.718
Previously on "The Americans"...

00:01.742 --> 00:03.356
You missed the meeting.

00:03.392 --> 00:05.225
Please stay away from me.

00:05.260 --> 00:09.262
The CIA is planning on
squeezing Burov in Moscow

00:09.297 --> 00:12.065
with the tape I made. It's not right.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.401
A shipment of midges
was sent six weeks ago

00:14.436 --> 00:16.403
to a business address in Oklahoma.

00:16.438 --> 00:19.406
What kind of bugs are these?

00:19.441 --> 00:20.473
What do they do?

00:20.509 --> 00:22.108
It's... It's a wheat-eater.

00:22.144 --> 00:23.343
Who do you work for?

00:23.378 --> 00:25.111
The lab has a contract

00:25.147 --> 00:26.859
with a-a company called AgriCorp.

00:26.888 --> 00:28.054
What are they using them for?

00:28.057 --> 00:29.482
W-We don't ask those questions.

00:29.484 --> 00:33.420
We just breed the bugs they tell us.

00:33.455 --> 00:34.750
You should have asked.

00:34.795 --> 00:35.828
Please, I...

00:37.325 --> 00:38.956
Stop, please!

00:51.473 --> 00:54.240
How did they do?

00:54.276 --> 00:55.475
Marilyn was fine.

00:55.510 --> 00:59.546
Uh... Norm needed a
couple of deep breaths,

00:59.581 --> 01:01.181
but they both did what they had to do.

01:01.216 --> 01:03.149
Good.

01:03.185 --> 01:06.186
This is Benjamin
Stobert from the Rolodex.

01:06.221 --> 01:09.355
We also think Deirdre
Kemp is a good bet.

01:09.391 --> 01:13.126
She's AgriCorp's Vice President
of Production and Distribution.

01:13.161 --> 01:16.362
They're both in Topeka,
and they're both single.

01:19.334 --> 01:23.169
Is there any way they
could find someone else...

01:23.205 --> 01:26.439
to...

01:26.475 --> 01:32.111
Going back and forth to
Topeka every week is just...

01:32.147 --> 01:34.481
Well, maybe you don't go
at the same time, but y...

01:34.516 --> 01:38.151
With the Morozovs and
Pastor Tim and Paige,

01:38.186 --> 01:41.387
Beeman, and Henry and Paige
going over there all the time...

01:41.423 --> 01:43.456
I... It's a lot.

01:46.428 --> 01:48.328
Is there something else bothering you

01:48.363 --> 01:50.230
that we should talk about?

01:53.502 --> 01:57.504
Paige is taking a lot of time
right now, more than usual.

01:57.539 --> 01:59.506
Of course. I understand that.

02:06.147 --> 02:09.082
We understand how important this is.

02:09.116 --> 02:12.151
Good. Then I know you'll work it out.

02:39.214 --> 02:41.481
You think we're gonna get fired?

02:41.516 --> 02:44.183
It's not funny.

02:44.219 --> 02:45.418
I know.

03:30.997 --> 03:33.332
What was the name of
the tree guy who came

03:33.335 --> 03:34.798
when the maple split?

03:34.834 --> 03:35.933
Poblocki.

03:35.968 --> 03:37.437
Yeah, I'm gonna call him again.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.836
That branch is gonna fall.

03:38.871 --> 03:41.038
Did you talk to Henry?

03:41.073 --> 03:43.040
Not yet. He's in the bathroom.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.717
There are no Apple Jacks left.

03:51.752 --> 03:53.952
So go to the store and
buy some Apple Jacks.

03:53.988 --> 03:56.488
But there was some.

03:56.524 --> 03:57.656
Yeah, sorry.

03:57.691 --> 04:00.592
Here. You can have my toast.

04:00.628 --> 04:05.497
So, do you know why we
got a message at work

04:05.533 --> 04:07.599
that your math teacher
wants to talk to us?

04:07.635 --> 04:09.501
I don't know.

04:09.537 --> 04:11.437
What do you mean you don't know?

04:11.472 --> 04:12.571
I don't know.

04:12.606 --> 04:14.573
You think he just called randomly?

04:14.608 --> 04:15.774
I have no idea.

04:15.810 --> 04:17.135
Don't be smart, Henry.

04:17.182 --> 04:18.733
I... I'm not! I don't know!

04:18.745 --> 04:20.512
I've been doing well.

04:20.548 --> 04:22.781
Some of the other kids
screw around, but I don't.

04:22.817 --> 04:24.683
Maybe I laugh sometimes.

04:24.718 --> 04:25.851
- Henry.
- What?

04:25.886 --> 04:28.620
I'm calling him today.

04:28.656 --> 04:29.721
Fine.

04:29.757 --> 04:31.083
You don't put enough jam on this.

04:31.086 --> 04:32.591
Henry!

04:32.626 --> 04:33.692
What?

04:33.727 --> 04:35.761
I would have finished that.

04:35.796 --> 04:38.797
Then take it out of
the trash and finish it.

04:54.073 --> 04:55.357
Ah!

04:55.962 --> 04:59.925
_

05:03.803 --> 05:08.433
_

05:09.705 --> 05:16.191
_

05:21.742 --> 05:24.443
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

05:24.478 --> 05:25.844
Here you go.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.647
Enjoy.

05:28.682 --> 05:30.716
And here you go.

05:30.751 --> 05:32.651
Enjoy.

05:39.645 --> 05:42.092
_

06:18.933 --> 06:21.500
I'm... I'm sorry.

06:23.571 --> 06:25.604
I'm sorry. Do you know
how to set the tension?

06:25.639 --> 06:27.311
Tense, loose.

06:27.381 --> 06:28.807
Loose. Thanks.

06:28.842 --> 06:31.810
I, uh, usually ride a... a regular bike,

06:31.845 --> 06:33.545
but I'm in... I'm in a town...

06:33.581 --> 06:34.746
In town on business.

06:34.782 --> 06:35.847
Huh.

06:35.883 --> 06:37.916
I'm sor... Uh, are you a local?

06:37.952 --> 06:39.851
- Yep.
- Okay, well I...

06:39.887 --> 06:41.653
One... One... One more.

06:41.689 --> 06:44.823
Um, ah, I'm gonna be
coming back a bunch,

06:44.858 --> 06:47.726
and I-I know nothing about, um, Topeka.

06:47.761 --> 06:49.661
What... what should
I do, like, when I'm...

06:49.697 --> 06:51.797
When I'm not working?

06:51.832 --> 06:53.832
I spend time with my family.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.567
Oh, you have kids?

06:55.603 --> 06:58.048
No. My sister's family.

06:58.087 --> 07:00.672
Nieces and nephews? Nice.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.808
Yeah, I have, uh...
I have three nephews.

07:02.843 --> 07:05.644
Love 'em to death, but
I'm always happy to leave.

07:05.679 --> 07:10.482
But you must do something
besides see them.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.817
I like my work.

07:11.852 --> 07:13.186
What do you do?

07:14.655 --> 07:15.821
Logistics...

07:15.856 --> 07:18.657
Storage, materials handling,

07:18.692 --> 07:20.659
identifying and fixing inefficiencies.

07:20.694 --> 07:22.561
Sounds like they can't
do anything without you.

07:22.596 --> 07:24.696
They can't.

07:24.732 --> 07:27.121
No wonder you have to exercise.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.834
I'm Gus Alexander.

07:28.869 --> 07:30.469
Oh.

07:30.504 --> 07:32.537
Deirdre Kemp.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.182
_

07:54.474 --> 07:57.435
_

07:59.479 --> 08:00.980
_

08:15.328 --> 08:17.539
_

08:19.124 --> 08:21.543
_

08:21.835 --> 08:23.962
_

08:28.967 --> 08:31.720
_

08:34.635 --> 08:36.735
Mom...

08:39.227 --> 08:41.395
_

08:41.730 --> 08:49.154
_

08:51.948 --> 08:55.243
_

08:59.372 --> 09:02.959
_

09:04.836 --> 09:06.421
_

09:11.801 --> 09:16.676
_

09:19.976 --> 09:21.978
_

09:26.687 --> 09:29.788
Mom...

09:47.693 --> 09:50.068
_

10:07.148 --> 10:08.525
_

10:11.611 --> 10:14.405
_

10:16.616 --> 10:18.326
_

10:19.202 --> 10:20.578
_

10:47.841 --> 10:49.774
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:51.678 --> 10:53.744
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.100
Everything okay?

10:55.127 --> 10:56.293
Yeah.

10:56.326 --> 11:00.585
Did, uh... Did you
talk to Henry's teacher?

11:00.620 --> 11:03.788
The school secretary said
he wants us to come in.

11:03.823 --> 11:05.456
Is he failing the class?

11:05.492 --> 11:06.524
I have no idea.

11:07.827 --> 11:11.529
All he ever does is play computer games

11:11.564 --> 11:13.431
and talk on the teleph...

11:13.466 --> 11:15.766
Do you have any idea
who he's talking to?

11:15.802 --> 11:17.535
No.

11:19.672 --> 11:21.539
How'd it go?

11:23.676 --> 11:26.744
She has a real passion for logistics.

11:26.779 --> 11:28.813
What does that mean?

11:33.686 --> 11:36.487
Is it promising?

11:36.530 --> 11:39.335
Maybe, if I don't die of boredom first.

11:39.405 --> 11:40.458
That bad?

11:40.493 --> 11:41.493
Whew.

11:44.631 --> 11:46.664
I go tomorrow.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.814
_

12:12.774 --> 12:15.652
_

12:15.655 --> 12:16.527
_

12:16.528 --> 12:19.948
_

12:20.865 --> 12:22.283
_

12:46.893 --> 12:49.431
_

12:49.434 --> 12:53.481
_

12:56.859 --> 12:59.821
_

13:00.029 --> 13:02.198
_

13:04.877 --> 13:07.197
Radanovic! Radanovic!

13:07.200 --> 13:10.331
_

13:10.334 --> 13:11.915
_

13:13.960 --> 13:17.187

13:17.190 --> 13:18.431
_

13:18.840 --> 13:21.217
_

13:23.302 --> 13:24.561
_

13:28.599 --> 13:30.351
_

13:56.169 --> 14:01.161
_

14:02.091 --> 14:06.510
_

14:06.885 --> 14:09.599
_

14:10.016 --> 14:13.728
_

14:14.729 --> 14:16.731
_

14:17.023 --> 14:20.651
_

14:20.657 --> 14:22.278
_

14:22.281 --> 14:24.313

14:24.316 --> 14:26.323
_

14:26.324 --> 14:30.899
_

14:31.120 --> 14:32.156
_

14:32.159 --> 14:34.789
_

14:34.792 --> 14:36.667
_

14:36.670 --> 14:41.047
_

14:42.842 --> 14:44.709
Hmm?

14:48.096 --> 14:51.307
_

14:56.270 --> 15:01.025
_

15:23.616 --> 15:25.649
Okay...

15:27.787 --> 15:29.620
Oh! No! Oh!

15:29.655 --> 15:30.688
Oh!

15:30.723 --> 15:34.458
Whoa! Wow!

15:35.661 --> 15:37.561
What'd you do, start an avalanche?

15:37.597 --> 15:39.597
I guess so!

15:39.632 --> 15:40.731
Thank you.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.600
Yeah.

15:44.771 --> 15:47.671
Do... do you know what this stuff is?

15:47.707 --> 15:49.673
- It's carob.
- No, no, I know,

15:49.709 --> 15:52.710
but do you know what it actually is?

15:52.745 --> 15:56.380
Um, it's like a natural,
sweet chocolate-type thingy?

15:56.415 --> 15:57.648
Is that the official term?

15:57.683 --> 16:00.417
Well, in Latin, it's called "thingus."

16:00.453 --> 16:01.485
Try one.

16:01.521 --> 16:04.488
No, I haven't paid.

16:04.524 --> 16:07.391
Have you never been in a
health food store before?

16:07.426 --> 16:08.626
- No.
- Well, it's okay.

16:08.661 --> 16:10.561
Try it.

16:13.466 --> 16:14.665
Go on.

16:18.771 --> 16:20.738
Mmm! That actually is good.

16:20.773 --> 16:22.606
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

16:23.776 --> 16:25.509
- Wow.
- Um...

16:25.545 --> 16:27.711
I'm in from out of town,
and a friend told me

16:27.747 --> 16:29.513
there was beautiful hiking around here,

16:29.549 --> 16:32.583
but that first I had
to make this... Gorp.

16:33.753 --> 16:35.586
Well, where are you gonna hike?

16:35.621 --> 16:36.720
I don't know.

16:36.756 --> 16:38.756
I mean, I'm actually
leaving town tomorrow,

16:38.791 --> 16:40.591
so I probably don't even have time.

16:40.626 --> 16:43.694
I'm coming back in a few days.
I have a work thing in the city.

16:43.729 --> 16:45.596
Well, lucky for you, you just ran into

16:45.631 --> 16:48.465
the Carob-Gorp-Eating-
Hiking-Expert of Topeka.

16:48.501 --> 16:50.701
- Wow.
- Yeah. Ben Stobert.

16:50.736 --> 16:53.671
Brenda Neill.

16:53.706 --> 16:56.740
It was all her.

16:58.811 --> 17:01.579
Thank you.

17:01.614 --> 17:03.681
- To beer.
- To beer.

17:03.716 --> 17:06.383
Cheers.

17:14.474 --> 17:17.595
In Soviet Union, we
have woman on street.

17:17.630 --> 17:21.397
You stand in line, she
pour a kvass into mug.

17:21.434 --> 17:23.867
You drink, next person, she pours,

17:23.903 --> 17:27.771
uh, kvass into same mug, they drink.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.875
We all drink from same mug.

17:30.910 --> 17:32.743
Ugh.

17:32.778 --> 17:35.813
Actually, kvass is the only
thing I miss from Russia.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.549
What... what is that?

17:38.584 --> 17:44.688
Mm... Like Russian cola made from bread.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.899
I make some in my basement.

17:46.926 --> 17:49.860
Here?

17:49.896 --> 17:53.764
Tastes like piss. I don't
know what I do wrong.

17:53.799 --> 17:55.766
How did you become a pilot?

17:55.801 --> 17:56.801
Oh.

17:56.836 --> 17:57.801
I was, uh...

17:57.837 --> 17:59.803
I was always into planes.

17:59.839 --> 18:03.924
I used to have those
balsa-wood-rubber-band ones

18:03.927 --> 18:05.052
when I was a kid.

18:05.055 --> 18:07.778
And where we grew up,
there was a... an airfield.

18:07.813 --> 18:09.680
It was small, but there was a guy there

18:09.715 --> 18:11.782
that let me work for
him, and, um, he taught me

18:11.817 --> 18:12.783
how to fly props.

18:12.818 --> 18:14.551
- As kid?
- Yeah.

18:14.587 --> 18:16.453
I got my license when I was 16,

18:16.489 --> 18:18.689
joined the Air Force when I was 18.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.724
- In war?
- Vietnam.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.660
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:22.695 --> 18:25.529
Yeah, not fighters... Re-supply.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.467
A-And then that's why, uh, Tuan, right?

18:30.503 --> 18:32.803
No, no, that was, um...

18:32.838 --> 18:36.740
It was different. We couldn't have kids.

18:36.776 --> 18:38.169
He's a good boy.

18:38.172 --> 18:39.810
So is Pasha.

18:44.662 --> 18:47.480
Him and his mother...
You think I did not

18:47.483 --> 18:49.064
fly him around the world,

18:49.100 --> 18:52.835
give him good clothes,
house, school, friends.

18:52.870 --> 18:53.936
Teenagers are tough.

18:53.971 --> 18:55.771
Evgheniya is not a teenager.

18:55.806 --> 18:58.774
If... if I did not love my job,
I would shoot my brains out.

19:00.044 --> 19:02.044
What is so great about your job?

19:04.649 --> 19:07.716
They think I'm genius.

19:07.752 --> 19:10.953
Everything they not know
about, uh, port, Russian,

19:10.988 --> 19:14.723
Soviet port... about
food, transportation,

19:14.759 --> 19:16.659
everything to do with grain, I know.

19:16.694 --> 19:18.794
They can't believe it take us months

19:18.829 --> 19:20.996
to move what you guys move in one day.

19:21.032 --> 19:22.998
"This is who we fight?

19:23.034 --> 19:26.475
You can't move wheat
from Odessa to Kharkov."

19:26.494 --> 19:29.475
And in Soviet Union,
we have same great land,

19:29.514 --> 19:33.042
same great climate, but system is broke.

19:33.077 --> 19:36.645
They still move food by horse sometimes.

19:36.681 --> 19:38.714
By the time it gets to
where it needs to be,

19:38.749 --> 19:41.083
it's already rotten.

19:44.789 --> 19:47.756
Scout bee discovers a source of food.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.959
He must communicate
the source's location

19:49.994 --> 19:51.660
to the other bees

19:51.696 --> 19:55.298
It does this through...

19:55.337 --> 19:58.968
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:59.003 --> 20:01.804
You didn't have to wait up.

20:01.839 --> 20:03.506
Saved you some chicken.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.503
I ate on the plane.

20:15.086 --> 20:16.685
You okay?

20:16.721 --> 20:19.755
Yeah, just tired.

20:20.858 --> 20:23.759
I have a gift for you.

20:27.064 --> 20:29.965
Guy sitting next to me bought it for me.

20:30.001 --> 20:33.102
I made a big deal of telling
him I'd give it to my husband.

20:33.137 --> 20:36.805
Hmm.

20:36.841 --> 20:38.107
How's everything here?

20:38.142 --> 20:41.844
Fine.

20:41.879 --> 20:43.812
Paige is babysitting

20:43.848 --> 20:46.529
for Claire Louise on Saturday night.

20:46.532 --> 20:48.766
- Mm.
- Mm.

20:52.890 --> 20:55.624
How was your guy?

20:55.660 --> 20:56.859
Mm.

20:56.894 --> 20:58.927
What?

20:58.963 --> 21:02.052
I don't know. Full of himself.

21:04.706 --> 21:06.807
We're going hiking this weekend.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.610
- In the face?
- Yeah. She still has a little scar.

21:27.613 --> 21:30.164
He said he didn't see
me before he swung,

21:30.167 --> 21:32.971
but my brother always was a sore loser.

21:33.007 --> 21:36.074
- Renee played shortstop.
- Thing is, I was really close

21:36.110 --> 21:37.876
to my brother and my dad.

21:37.912 --> 21:39.878
I always sort of had
to be one of the guys.

21:39.914 --> 21:42.553
I tried playing softball but hated it.

21:42.556 --> 21:44.082
Would have rather played baseball,

21:44.084 --> 21:45.984
but there wasn't
anything like that then.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.052
So, you never played?

21:47.087 --> 21:48.253
Nothing official,

21:48.289 --> 21:50.889
just pick-up games in our neighborhood.

21:50.925 --> 21:53.025
Now I play in my company's
intramural league.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.159
She won't let me go to the games.

21:54.161 --> 21:55.794
He gets too excited.

21:55.829 --> 21:57.896
- Well, it's exciting.
- You do!

21:57.932 --> 22:00.966
So... So, where are you two from?

22:01.001 --> 22:02.234
Chicago. Pittsburgh.

22:02.269 --> 22:03.446
Oh.

22:03.449 --> 22:04.892
I had an uncle from Pittsburgh.

22:04.895 --> 22:06.204
Oh, yeah? What'd he do?

22:06.240 --> 22:07.751
Scrap metal.

22:07.754 --> 22:09.932
He had this big yard
out in Ross Township.

22:09.967 --> 22:13.373
I used to love visiting.
I'd climb all over the piles.

22:13.376 --> 22:14.970
I found some really good stuff, too...

22:15.006 --> 22:17.907
Broken TVs, radios, hair dryers.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.219
_

22:25.803 --> 22:31.093
_

22:31.096 --> 22:34.979
_

22:35.523 --> 22:37.731
_

22:37.940 --> 22:42.815
_

22:43.779 --> 22:47.574
_

22:50.661 --> 22:51.996
_

22:54.039 --> 22:56.583
_

22:59.253 --> 23:01.547
_

23:02.131 --> 23:06.844
_

23:08.304 --> 23:11.306
_

23:11.307 --> 23:13.391
_

23:13.392 --> 23:15.894
_

23:16.520 --> 23:19.606
_

23:20.566 --> 23:22.609
_

23:24.111 --> 23:26.029
_

23:26.030 --> 23:30.074
_

23:30.075 --> 23:32.703
_

23:33.287 --> 23:37.333
_

23:37.373 --> 23:40.627
_

23:41.503 --> 23:43.464
_

23:44.003 --> 23:45.023
_

23:46.592 --> 23:53.515
_

23:54.099 --> 23:57.978
_

24:03.817 --> 24:05.027
_

24:19.797 --> 24:21.764
Any sign of him?

24:21.799 --> 24:24.867
He's still getting his hair cut.

24:24.902 --> 24:28.804
I was thinking...

24:28.840 --> 24:30.739
about Burov.

24:32.944 --> 24:35.945
In San Francisco, we had a guy.

24:35.980 --> 24:38.948
Offered him a lot, but nothing.

24:38.983 --> 24:41.884
We found out he was having an affair.

24:41.919 --> 24:43.079
He was a sensitive type,

24:43.082 --> 24:45.654
couldn't handle his wife finding out.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.591
We just had to drop that we knew.

24:48.626 --> 24:51.727
That was enough. We had him.

24:51.762 --> 24:53.863
Still gave him everything we offered.

24:53.898 --> 24:58.634
He ended up with a boatload of cash.

24:58.669 --> 25:00.569
And the family?

25:00.605 --> 25:01.971
His family's still together.

25:02.006 --> 25:04.773
He and his wife are U.S.
citizens with new names

25:04.809 --> 25:06.842
and a split-level in Tucson.

25:06.878 --> 25:09.879
I think his son's a lawyer.

25:09.914 --> 25:11.747
All's well that ends well.

25:11.774 --> 25:14.709
Yeah.

25:14.752 --> 25:17.553
We blackmailed the shit out of him,

25:17.588 --> 25:19.852
and everybody wound up happy.

25:26.631 --> 25:28.631
Number's on the fridge.

25:28.666 --> 25:30.799
We're around the corner,
so don't hesitate to call.

25:30.835 --> 25:31.835
It's just dinner.

25:31.869 --> 25:33.769
She'll wake around 9:00.

25:33.804 --> 25:35.538
Give her a bottle, change her,

25:35.573 --> 25:36.893
and then she'll go back to sleep.

25:36.908 --> 25:37.873
If she doesn't?

25:37.909 --> 25:39.575
Panic.

25:40.611 --> 25:41.677
There she is!

25:41.712 --> 25:43.679
Oh! I just forgot one thing.

25:43.714 --> 25:44.954
We really appreciate it, Paige.

25:44.982 --> 25:46.749
Sure.

25:46.784 --> 25:48.651
Alice is a little nervous.

25:48.686 --> 25:51.654
I get it.

25:51.689 --> 25:54.590
So, you and your mom coming
to the food pantry Thursday?

25:54.625 --> 25:55.791
She wouldn't miss it.

25:55.826 --> 25:57.960
She likes us doing it together.

25:57.995 --> 26:00.563
That's great.

26:00.598 --> 26:02.865
She's really trying, Paige.

26:02.900 --> 26:03.900
Yeah.

26:03.935 --> 26:05.634
No, I mean it.

26:05.670 --> 26:07.937
The... the things I deal
with with families...

26:07.972 --> 26:10.606
I'm not saying it's the same as yours.

26:10.641 --> 26:12.443
No one's is the same as mine.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.811
You'd be surprised how
many people feel that way.

26:26.724 --> 26:29.525
This might help you
understand them a little bit.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.760
Marx? I thought he hated religion.

26:31.796 --> 26:33.729
Uh, h-he did.

26:33.764 --> 26:36.699
But he was pretty great
on class and poverty.

26:36.734 --> 26:37.833
Are these your notes?

26:37.868 --> 26:41.770
Mm-hmm. It's from college.

26:41.806 --> 26:45.541
Here.

26:45.576 --> 26:48.611
"Labor is therefore not
voluntary but coerced.

26:48.646 --> 26:51.614
It is therefore not the
satisfaction of a need.

26:51.649 --> 26:54.883
It is merely a means to
satisfy needs external to it."

26:54.919 --> 26:56.585
What?

26:56.621 --> 26:59.922
All right, j... Read the book.

26:59.957 --> 27:01.924
- Okay.
- All right.

27:01.959 --> 27:03.692
We better go before
she changes her mind.

27:05.529 --> 27:07.529
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:34.625 --> 27:37.726
Hi, Deirdre. It's Gus Alexander.

27:37.762 --> 27:39.728
Uh, from the gym.

27:39.764 --> 27:41.530
Yeah. Yeah.

27:41.565 --> 27:44.700
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna be
in town for a few days.

27:44.735 --> 27:50.773
Is there any chance, uh,
you'd be free for dinner?

27:50.808 --> 27:54.843
Yeah. Oh, me too, but
you got to eat, right?

27:54.879 --> 27:56.645
Oh. Oh, well, no.

27:56.681 --> 27:58.914
I-I know all about a
big... A big presentation.

27:58.949 --> 28:01.684
How about this... Um,
I call you when I get in,

28:01.719 --> 28:06.955
and I'll... I'll just,
um, hope for the best.

28:06.991 --> 28:09.491
Okay, great. Yeah.

28:09.527 --> 28:11.960
Okay. See you.

28:16.767 --> 28:19.868
When I was a kid, we, uh...
We had a feeder out back,

28:19.904 --> 28:23.806
and I... I'd just... I'd
just sit there and watch.

28:23.841 --> 28:26.642
Hummingbirds, woodpeckers...

28:26.677 --> 28:28.711
Woodpeckers are crazy.

28:28.746 --> 28:29.878
Why?

28:29.914 --> 28:31.747
Do you know where they
keep their tongues?

28:31.782 --> 28:32.815
No. Where?

28:32.817 --> 28:34.817
- Their head?
- Yeah.

28:34.852 --> 28:36.952
Yeah, they have these really
long tongues to get the bugs.

28:36.954 --> 28:38.754
That's why they're banging their heads

28:38.789 --> 28:41.199
against the trees all day...
To make holes for the tongue.

28:41.202 --> 28:42.023
- Wow.
- Yeah.

28:42.026 --> 28:43.826
They have to store it somewhere, right?

28:43.861 --> 28:47.563
So it... it wraps around the
top of their head on the inside.

28:47.598 --> 28:49.498
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

28:49.533 --> 28:50.833
I always imagine the moment

28:50.835 --> 28:52.868
it comes out.

28:54.905 --> 28:55.938
It must feel good, right?

28:55.973 --> 28:57.740
I guess so!

28:57.775 --> 28:59.942
Yeah.

31:13.043 --> 31:14.953
Wait.

32:13.704 --> 32:16.972
Wait. Wait.

32:17.007 --> 32:18.840
Too fast?

32:20.744 --> 32:22.878
- Um...
- We... we can go slower.

32:24.982 --> 32:26.815
I like you.

32:28.919 --> 32:32.554
Great.

32:32.589 --> 32:34.790
I like you, too.

32:34.825 --> 32:37.115
- But...
- Oh, you, uh...

32:37.118 --> 32:38.894
You don't have a boyfriend, do you?

32:38.896 --> 32:41.763
No. No, I don't.

32:41.799 --> 32:43.665
But I am a bad planner.

32:43.701 --> 32:47.636
Um, I have work tonight.

32:47.671 --> 32:50.539
I'll be back next week.

32:50.573 --> 32:52.740
Can I see you then?

32:52.776 --> 32:54.509
Hmm...

32:54.545 --> 32:56.545
let me think about it.

33:00.884 --> 33:02.517
Yes, please.

33:25.049 --> 33:26.942
Agent Beeman.

33:26.944 --> 33:29.945
Sorry, I only have a few minutes.

33:29.980 --> 33:32.647
Uh, that's all I need.

33:35.919 --> 33:38.987
You remember three years
ago when that KGB officer

33:39.023 --> 33:42.758
was killed... Vladimir Kosygin?

33:46.930 --> 33:50.966
He was kidnapped by
a group of FBI agents

33:51.001 --> 33:54.736
and then shot in cold blood.

33:54.780 --> 34:00.517
For now, it doesn't really
matter who took Kosygin or why.

34:00.544 --> 34:02.878
I shot him.

34:02.913 --> 34:04.546
Once.

34:04.581 --> 34:06.515
In the back of the head.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.887
You killed him?

34:11.922 --> 34:15.891
Yes.

34:15.926 --> 34:18.627
And... what?

34:18.661 --> 34:23.532
You want to be arrested, prosecuted?

34:23.567 --> 34:27.936
What happens next, that's up to you.

34:27.971 --> 34:32.741
But if the CIA uses the tape
I made to blackmail Burov,

34:32.775 --> 34:36.777
I will go public and confess.

34:36.813 --> 34:39.848
The U.S. government
killing innocent people,

34:39.882 --> 34:42.717
splashed across the world's newspapers.

34:46.056 --> 34:49.491
I swore an oath to uphold the
Constitution, Agent Beeman.

34:49.525 --> 34:53.728
Unlike you, I haven't
forgotten what that means.

34:55.766 --> 34:59.501
I'm guessing you'll keep
quiet like the rest of us.

34:59.536 --> 35:02.255
And you will find a way to make sure

35:02.258 --> 35:05.560
the CIA leaves Oleg Burov alone.

35:20.807 --> 35:22.941
Hi.

35:22.976 --> 35:24.576
How was school?

35:24.611 --> 35:25.844
Fine.

35:28.548 --> 35:29.614
Hey, don't fill up.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.816
I'm making lasagna.

35:32.106 --> 35:33.772
Who's home?

35:33.807 --> 35:34.873
Just me.

35:34.908 --> 35:36.074
Dad's at work.

35:36.110 --> 35:37.943
Henry is with Doug.

35:37.978 --> 35:40.212
Doug? I haven't heard
that name in a while.

35:40.247 --> 35:42.948
I know. Suspicious, right?

35:42.983 --> 35:45.370
I'm thinking girlfriend.

35:45.373 --> 35:46.438
Henry?

35:46.474 --> 35:48.407
Well, he's always on the phone.

35:48.442 --> 35:50.276
Have you heard anything?

35:50.311 --> 35:53.078
Well, I know he talks
to a girl named Kira.

35:53.114 --> 35:54.246
Kira...

35:54.282 --> 35:56.348
But I've also heard "Wendy."

35:56.384 --> 35:59.418
Wow.

35:59.453 --> 36:03.289
You guys have been traveling a lot.

36:23.411 --> 36:26.445
It's what we were
talking to you about...

36:26.480 --> 36:29.415
The, uh, grain thing.

36:31.485 --> 36:36.055
We're, um, developing some new sources,

36:36.090 --> 36:41.026
and unfortunately, it takes
some travel to get to them.

36:41.062 --> 36:43.128
You go separately, though.

36:43.164 --> 36:49.134
Sometimes we need to get
to know different people.

36:49.170 --> 36:52.137
So, who are you getting to know?

36:52.173 --> 36:55.140
Um... a scientist...

36:55.176 --> 36:58.177
Someone who knows a
lot about this stuff.

36:58.212 --> 37:00.245
So, he doesn't know who you really are?

37:00.281 --> 37:01.313
No.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.216
So who do you say you are?

37:04.251 --> 37:06.986
A salesperson.

37:07.021 --> 37:09.321
What do you sell?

37:09.357 --> 37:12.057
Women's clothing.

37:16.297 --> 37:19.064
Do you use a different name?

37:19.100 --> 37:22.334
Yeah.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.336
What is it?

37:27.475 --> 37:29.308
Brenda Neill.

37:29.343 --> 37:33.312
Brenda Neill?

37:33.347 --> 37:35.703
What's so funny about that name?

37:35.706 --> 37:38.006
I don't know, it just... It's weird.

37:41.222 --> 37:44.490
I would be scared of
someone finding out.

37:46.394 --> 37:51.130
Yeah, I guess a lot of
its just, um, confidence.

37:53.134 --> 37:57.403
Listen... Uh, when I was at
Pastor Tim's babysitting...

37:57.438 --> 38:00.440
I found his diary.

38:00.443 --> 38:02.242
- Paige...
- I just thought that if

38:02.276 --> 38:03.613
I could find that lawyer's name...

38:03.615 --> 38:04.747
- No.
- ...with the tape...

38:04.750 --> 38:06.011
No, no, no. I know.

38:06.047 --> 38:07.047
It's too dangerous.

38:07.081 --> 38:08.147
They were out.

38:08.182 --> 38:09.248
What if they came back?

38:09.283 --> 38:11.083
I would have heard their car.

38:11.118 --> 38:12.251
Paige, you can look different

38:12.253 --> 38:13.386
after you've done something like that.

38:13.388 --> 38:14.930
You can sound different.

38:14.933 --> 38:17.423
H-He just writes about
people from the church.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.192
He uses their initials.

38:20.227 --> 38:22.127
I could figure out
who most of them were.

38:24.465 --> 38:28.167
Did he write anything about us?

38:28.202 --> 38:30.002
Not that I saw.

38:30.037 --> 38:35.374
Listen... I... I understand
what you were doing,

38:35.409 --> 38:38.210
and it was smart, and it was brave.

38:38.245 --> 38:41.683
But, Paige, if there is any slip,

38:41.686 --> 38:44.383
if they sense anything from you,

38:44.418 --> 38:46.985
Alice wouldn't come to us next time.

38:47.021 --> 38:50.122
She would go straight to the FBI.

38:55.129 --> 38:58.097
I'm sorry.

38:58.132 --> 39:00.964
But I was there, not you.

39:32.870 --> 39:39.419
_

39:42.005 --> 39:43.881
_

39:44.799 --> 39:46.843

39:48.511 --> 39:55.184
_

39:56.311 --> 39:59.396

39:59.397 --> 40:02.942

40:04.902 --> 40:07.324

40:11.367 --> 40:12.855

40:13.901 --> 40:15.465

40:16.831 --> 40:22.211
_

40:25.089 --> 40:27.592
_

40:36.559 --> 40:39.270
_

40:48.136 --> 40:50.309
...not park in the red zone.

40:50.344 --> 40:54.246
Unattended vehicles will
be ticketed and towed.

41:00.454 --> 41:04.256
Welcome to John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

41:10.297 --> 41:12.364
Taxi.

41:18.305 --> 41:20.372
Going through his things.

41:20.407 --> 41:24.209
If she even looked nervous...

41:24.245 --> 41:27.145
How did you leave it?

41:27.181 --> 41:29.381
I told her it was crazy and dangerous

41:29.416 --> 41:32.284
and she could never do it again.

41:32.319 --> 41:34.119
Okay.

41:35.189 --> 41:36.455
Did she get it?

41:36.490 --> 41:37.829
I hope so.

41:42.529 --> 41:44.429
What?

41:47.401 --> 41:49.401
She just...

41:52.074 --> 41:53.254
What?

41:57.144 --> 41:59.707
If there was something on him

41:59.710 --> 42:01.380
with a parishioner...

42:01.415 --> 42:03.282
- Elizabeth...
- No, no... I know,

42:03.317 --> 42:05.384
but it's interesting, right?

42:05.419 --> 42:09.254
I mean, who knows what goes
on with the good pastor?

42:23.952 --> 42:27.339
What about Kansas?

42:27.374 --> 42:29.474
It was fine.

42:29.510 --> 42:33.211
I don't want to talk about it.

42:33.247 --> 42:35.047
Why?

42:37.351 --> 42:39.418
Because it's...

42:44.158 --> 42:45.457
What?

42:48.162 --> 42:49.227
I don't know what to say.

42:49.263 --> 42:53.332
He's... nice.

42:53.367 --> 42:55.334
He likes birds and hiking.

42:55.369 --> 42:59.071
He's funny.

42:59.106 --> 43:01.340
You like him?

43:05.412 --> 43:10.082
I have to sit there with
him while he makes his jokes.

43:10.117 --> 43:12.250
The guy's laughing while
he's trying to starve

43:12.286 --> 43:15.020
an entire country.
