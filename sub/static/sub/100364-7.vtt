00:47.003 --> 00:49.203
I know you don't want to
hear this, but I have a plan.

00:49.204 --> 00:51.871
You're right, I don't want
to hear it, so let's drop it.

00:56.079 --> 00:59.080
What the fuck did you just do?

00:59.149 --> 01:00.582
That right there

01:00.650 --> 01:02.517
is some of the finest
saffron on the market.

01:02.586 --> 01:05.486
- Saffron?
- You got no idea.

01:05.555 --> 01:07.222
This stuff is like red gold.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.690
It's easily the most expensive
spice by weight on the planet.

01:09.691 --> 01:11.493
And guess where it's grown?

01:11.561 --> 01:14.062
Right here, in the
fertile blood-soaked soil

01:14.131 --> 01:15.497
of Afghanistan.

01:15.565 --> 01:17.132
How convenient.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.400
This stuff sells for like
500 bucks an ounce retail.

01:19.429 --> 01:20.989
Double that in some parts of the world.

01:20.990 --> 01:22.637
We've been wasting
our time with hashish.

01:22.706 --> 01:24.273
Look, whatever you're scheme
you're coming up with next,

01:24.274 --> 01:25.807
I don't want any part of it.

01:25.876 --> 01:27.909
I owe people in four
different time zones money.

01:27.978 --> 01:29.477
A lot of money.

01:29.546 --> 01:31.846
Look, I've already
worked out all the math.

01:31.915 --> 01:34.149
For every pound of
this stuff that we sell,

01:34.217 --> 01:36.317
we make a cool eight grand profit.

01:36.386 --> 01:38.106
Local farmers are already
growing the stuff.

01:38.107 --> 01:40.155
All we gotta do is
buy low and sell high.

01:40.223 --> 01:42.357
- Oh, is that all?
- Yeah.

01:44.227 --> 01:45.927
Perfect.

01:45.996 --> 01:48.596
We sell directly to high-end
restaurants all over the world.

01:48.665 --> 01:51.399
For one, we have no contacts
for high-end restaurants

01:51.468 --> 01:53.201
all over the world.

01:53.270 --> 01:54.969
For two, most of the saffron trade

01:55.038 --> 01:57.172
around these parts is run by Taliban.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.040
And for three, you forgot
to mention the part

01:59.109 --> 02:01.442
where it takes a couple
hundred thousand flowers

02:01.511 --> 02:04.612
just to harvest a single
pound of the stuff.

02:07.450 --> 02:09.150
How do you know all that?

02:09.219 --> 02:11.219
I've been reading the same
article in the "Nat Geo"

02:11.220 --> 02:12.752
that's been sitting on the toilet

02:12.821 --> 02:14.822
for the last two months that you did.

02:14.891 --> 02:17.425
I just happened to
read the entire article.

02:17.994 --> 02:19.894
I'm just trying to help you out, man.

02:19.963 --> 02:21.896
Appreciate it, but all
your schemes so far

02:21.965 --> 02:23.865
were supposed to be a sure thing.

02:23.934 --> 02:26.467
The only thing I know for
sure is that I'm flat broke

02:26.536 --> 02:29.337
and my family is about
to lose their home.

02:29.406 --> 02:31.439
I can't afford any more losses, my man.

02:31.508 --> 02:33.007
We're gonna figure this one out.

02:33.076 --> 02:35.143
We always do.

02:35.212 --> 02:36.978
Can I sit with you guys?

02:38.248 --> 02:39.547
It's not fucking middle school.

02:39.616 --> 02:41.216
You don't need to ask.

02:41.284 --> 02:43.384
I was home schooled.

02:43.453 --> 02:47.589
So did you see those
rad wheels out there?

02:47.657 --> 02:50.458
- Stay away, kid.
- What? Why?

02:50.527 --> 02:51.887
You got a lot better things to do

02:51.888 --> 02:53.661
with the money you don't have.

02:53.730 --> 02:56.030
Okay, but I... I can go look, can't I?

02:56.099 --> 02:57.699
Just don't touch.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.001
Okay.

02:59.402 --> 03:01.703
- Well, you know what?
- Uh, I'm not hungry.

03:01.771 --> 03:05.240
I'm gonna go check 'em out.

03:05.308 --> 03:08.109
Keep it in your pants, kid.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.447
They are beautiful, aren't they?

03:12.515 --> 03:14.482
Don't you think after
laying your life on the line

03:14.551 --> 03:16.017
to spread freedom and democracy,

03:16.086 --> 03:17.726
you deserve to come
home in something nice

03:17.795 --> 03:18.995
waiting for you in the garage?

03:18.996 --> 03:20.855
Well, it's my parents' garage.

03:22.993 --> 03:25.293
Why don't you get in? Fire her up.

03:28.465 --> 03:30.365
I never get tired of that sound.

03:31.735 --> 03:33.434
Now I can get you into this

03:33.503 --> 03:35.570
for a low down payment of $5,000.

03:36.873 --> 03:38.473
Oh, that's a lot of money.

03:38.541 --> 03:39.861
That's barely three months' pay.

03:39.930 --> 03:41.463
It's tax-free, and I'm gonna give you

03:41.531 --> 03:43.444
a $500 military discount.

03:43.513 --> 03:46.481
Close your eyes for
a second. Picture this.

03:46.549 --> 03:49.684
You return home a war hero.

03:49.753 --> 03:52.287
You pull up to a stoplight
in your brand-new sled.

03:52.355 --> 03:55.790
In the car next to you, it's your rival.

03:55.859 --> 03:57.992
- I don't have a rival.
- Light turns green,

03:58.061 --> 04:00.028
you dust that jackalope off the line.

04:00.096 --> 04:03.531
Zero to 60, 3.5 seconds.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.600
Whole town sees it.

04:05.669 --> 04:07.568
Ladies will be literally fighting

04:07.637 --> 04:11.105
over who gets to blow you
from this passenger seat.

04:12.876 --> 04:15.209
Thank you for your work.
Thank you very much.

04:15.278 --> 04:17.345
Thank you. How are you?

04:17.414 --> 04:19.346
Good to see you. Eat up, gentlemen.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.015
As you can see, it's a multiethnic,

04:21.084 --> 04:23.184
multinational base, got
a lot of moving parts,

04:23.253 --> 04:25.173
but they move well together.
That's what matters.

04:25.174 --> 04:27.188
That's attributed to
your fine work as well.

04:27.257 --> 04:29.490
Well, I'm doing the best
I can with what I got.

04:29.559 --> 04:32.460
Ah, thank you.

04:32.529 --> 04:34.028
Staying out of trouble, Sergeant?

04:34.097 --> 04:35.863
Uh, doing my best, sir.

04:35.932 --> 04:38.433
I'm giving Mr. Goodall, the
new Secretary of the Army,

04:38.501 --> 04:40.335
a tour around FOB Guardian.

04:40.403 --> 04:42.837
Oh, welcome to the Orphanage, sir.

04:42.906 --> 04:44.005
The Orphanage?

04:44.074 --> 04:45.373
It's an unsanctioned nickname.

04:45.442 --> 04:46.974
- Ah.
- Yeah, when you're

04:47.043 --> 04:49.143
in a foreign country, out
in the middle of nowhere,

04:49.212 --> 04:50.611
it's easy to feel abandoned.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.247
Orphanage sounds apt. I like it.

04:53.316 --> 04:55.316
Sergeant Alvarez is one
of my best flight medics.

04:55.318 --> 04:56.718
Hm.

04:56.786 --> 04:59.487
Best of luck with this
war, Mr. Secretary.

05:01.758 --> 05:04.559
Maybe let's get a picture
over there, switch things up.

05:07.263 --> 05:10.665
Sergeant, would you mind taking a photo?

05:10.734 --> 05:12.033
Sarah, my executive assistant,

05:12.102 --> 05:15.370
keeps telling me that
I need fresh content

05:15.438 --> 05:17.038
for my social media platforms.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.506
- Sure.
- Milton!

05:18.575 --> 05:20.775
Like to introduce you
all to Allen Milton,

05:20.844 --> 05:22.443
one of the best war photojournalists

05:22.512 --> 05:23.978
who's ever lived.

05:24.047 --> 05:25.480
Yeah, close in up.

05:25.481 --> 05:27.681
Colonel Austin, could
you just... Thanks.

05:27.684 --> 05:30.585
Say "too old for this shit".

05:32.134 --> 05:33.521
Got it? Good.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.390
Sergeant, if there is anything you need,

05:35.458 --> 05:38.025
please feel free to contact my office.

05:38.094 --> 05:40.428
Service members like yourself
keep this machine running.

05:40.497 --> 05:42.530
Sir, can I ask a question?

05:42.599 --> 05:44.232
That's why I'm here.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.634
Why is the DOD terminating
the MAVNI program?

05:46.703 --> 05:48.770
- Alvarez...
- No.

05:48.838 --> 05:50.271
That's an honest question.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.007
And maybe one day we'll
have the time to sit down

05:53.076 --> 05:54.942
so I can give you a complicated answer

05:55.011 --> 05:56.811
to a complicated situation.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.746
Uh, Mr. Secretary,

05:58.815 --> 06:00.782
I wanna show you our
Tactical Operations Center.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.784
- Good idea.
- Terrific.

06:02.852 --> 06:05.319
Mr. Secretary...

06:05.989 --> 06:07.722
Sorry, I realize you're very busy,

06:07.791 --> 06:10.291
but if you had a moment,
my team and I would love

06:10.360 --> 06:11.859
to take you for a spin in the bird.

06:11.928 --> 06:13.428
Show you what it's like to be

06:13.456 --> 06:14.856
a combat medic here in Afghanistan.

06:14.857 --> 06:17.398
That would be very enlightening.

06:17.467 --> 06:20.201
Sarah, follow up with
Colonel Austin's office

06:20.270 --> 06:21.569
to set that up.

06:21.638 --> 06:23.638
Done.

06:27.377 --> 06:30.378
Your crew is hell-bent on
being a pain in my ass!

06:30.447 --> 06:32.327
And may I remind you that
you are still grounded

06:32.348 --> 06:34.682
after that incident with
SecCorp and the morphine?

06:35.718 --> 06:38.553
Stay in your lane,
Sergeant! That's an order!

06:42.240 --> 06:43.806
Way to get us back in the air.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.775
Look, it'll give us a
chance to corner this guy

06:45.776 --> 06:47.310
and maybe change his mind
on this MAVNI bullshit.

06:47.311 --> 06:49.144
'Cause there's no guarantee
that this marriage

06:49.173 --> 06:50.413
is gonna get you the Green Card

06:50.414 --> 06:51.814
and keep you from getting deported.

06:51.849 --> 06:53.609
Nothing is going to change
that man's mind.

06:53.651 --> 06:54.731
We're gonna try.

06:54.786 --> 06:56.826
She's right. Those
motherfuckers tow the party line.

06:56.827 --> 06:58.487
They don't make decisions by themselves.

06:58.556 --> 07:00.316
At least I'll get some
special dispensation

07:00.317 --> 07:01.790
for my wife out of it then.

07:01.859 --> 07:03.979
You will do anything to have
this marriage annulled.

07:11.067 --> 07:12.734
Raise you 50.

07:12.802 --> 07:15.069
- Puts me all in.
- That's the idea.

07:15.138 --> 07:17.305
Call.

07:17.374 --> 07:18.973
You gonna show your hand?

07:19.042 --> 07:20.402
Hang on. What are you doing here?

07:20.443 --> 07:22.076
Why are you ghosting me

07:22.145 --> 07:24.065
like I'm some shitty date
you're trying to shake?

07:24.066 --> 07:25.079
Ghosting?

07:25.148 --> 07:26.814
I think it's what the kids call it

07:26.883 --> 07:28.683
when you don't wanna
talk to someone anymore.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.385
Hey buddy, go fuck yourself.

07:32.422 --> 07:33.902
You know you're not allowed in here.

07:33.903 --> 07:35.670
Try and remove me.

07:40.663 --> 07:42.383
Why did you say "and
that's how you sell it"

07:42.384 --> 07:43.865
to me after the fight?

07:43.933 --> 07:46.033
I was just having a little fun, babe.

07:46.102 --> 07:47.742
- Were you?
- What do you wanna say to me?

07:47.804 --> 07:50.638
- Did you take a dive?
- Huh?

07:50.707 --> 07:52.640
You heard what I said.

07:52.709 --> 07:57.178
During the fight did you take a dive?

07:57.247 --> 07:59.280
Answer the fucking question.

07:59.349 --> 08:00.848
Why would I do that?

08:00.917 --> 08:03.718
That's what I'm here to find out.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.420
How'd Roback know to bet on me?

08:05.488 --> 08:06.988
How the hell do I know?

08:07.056 --> 08:09.176
After I told you all about
the Bodyguard's weakness,

08:09.205 --> 08:10.725
you couldn't wait to run and tell him.

08:10.726 --> 08:11.826
Okay, yes.

08:11.895 --> 08:14.028
I told him because I knew
Davis needed the cash.

08:14.091 --> 08:15.531
He was gonna lose his family's home,

08:15.532 --> 08:16.772
and I knew that could help him.

08:16.773 --> 08:19.467
Bullshit! This isn't about Davis.

08:19.536 --> 08:21.502
This is about Roback.

08:21.571 --> 08:23.331
This is about you screwing
him behind my back

08:23.332 --> 08:25.199
the entire time we've been together.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.308
I'm over Roback.

08:27.377 --> 08:30.578
That doesn't really answer
the question, does it?

08:30.647 --> 08:32.212
It should.

08:32.282 --> 08:34.682
I had a gut feeling that
everything I told you

08:34.751 --> 08:37.083
would get back to
Roback, and I was right.

08:37.153 --> 08:39.352
Wow, so this was some
kind of loyalty test.

08:39.422 --> 08:44.091
- And you failed.
- Well, fuck you and your test.

08:44.794 --> 08:46.794
Then I need to hear it.

08:47.997 --> 08:49.717
Have you been screwing
Roback behind my back

08:49.718 --> 08:51.184
this whole time we've been together?

08:57.974 --> 08:59.173
Fuck!

09:02.545 --> 09:05.446
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

09:05.515 --> 09:07.014
I was starting to think

09:07.083 --> 09:09.817
I was never gonna hear from you again.

09:09.886 --> 09:11.419
How did Max do in his game?

09:11.488 --> 09:13.855
Good, he hit the game-winning home run.

09:13.923 --> 09:15.289
- Oh!
- Yeah.

09:15.358 --> 09:16.624
He's really killing it.

09:16.693 --> 09:18.059
I mean, the coach is going nuts.

09:18.127 --> 09:20.595
Oh, that's great.

09:21.364 --> 09:24.131
Um...

09:24.200 --> 09:26.067
so my tour got extended by three months.

09:26.135 --> 09:29.270
Are you fucking kidding me? Why?

09:29.339 --> 09:31.038
We're spread so thin,

09:31.107 --> 09:33.441
and, you know, my
job is mission critical.

09:33.510 --> 09:36.143
No, I can't... I can't believe
we're doing this again.

09:36.212 --> 09:38.746
- Yeah, I know.
- What do I tell the kids?

09:38.815 --> 09:41.048
The same thing you always tell them.

09:41.117 --> 09:43.150
You know, that mommy loves them so much,

09:43.219 --> 09:45.620
and three months isn't really that long.

09:45.688 --> 09:47.188
And what do I tell myself?

09:47.257 --> 09:49.490
That...

09:49.559 --> 09:51.659
you knew this was gonna
be a big part of our life

09:51.728 --> 09:53.394
when you married me.

09:53.463 --> 09:56.230
I gotta go.

10:16.619 --> 10:18.586
Thanks to Sergeant Roback here,

10:18.655 --> 10:20.755
Secretary Goodall
reached out to my office

10:20.823 --> 10:22.957
to go on a ride-along
with my flight medics,

10:23.026 --> 10:24.759
specifically your crew.

10:24.827 --> 10:26.294
I thought we were grounded, sir.

10:26.362 --> 10:28.229
You were, but against
my better judgment,

10:28.298 --> 10:29.830
I have no choice but to send you up.

10:29.899 --> 10:31.799
And if this was a ruse
to get reinstated,

10:31.868 --> 10:33.701
congratulations, it worked.

10:33.770 --> 10:35.570
But know that if I was not a crew short,

10:35.638 --> 10:36.958
you'd all still be on the ground.

10:36.973 --> 10:38.839
Life has a funny way of changing up

10:38.908 --> 10:41.108
- the best laid plans, sir.
- But some more than others.

10:41.109 --> 10:42.656
Just happy to be back in the air, sir.

10:42.657 --> 10:43.844
I'm sure you are.

10:43.913 --> 10:45.873
Does this mean that our
pay is being reinstated?

10:45.874 --> 10:47.214
It does.

10:47.283 --> 10:49.243
Can't send the Secretary
of the whole goddamn Army

10:49.285 --> 10:51.919
up with a crew who's serving
out an Article 15, can I?

10:51.988 --> 10:55.222
- Couldn't agree more, sir.
- Davis, you're dismissed.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.725
You two stay here.

10:57.794 --> 10:59.514
I've just received word
from Corporal Durkin

10:59.529 --> 11:01.129
that you've both been
given the green light

11:01.130 --> 11:02.698
for your Permanent
Resident Card interview.

11:02.699 --> 11:04.065
- Yes, sir.
- The corporal will RV

11:04.093 --> 11:05.693
with you both to schedule transportation

11:05.694 --> 11:07.068
to Bagram and the embassy.

11:07.136 --> 11:08.936
- Thank you, sir.
- We really appreciate this.

11:08.937 --> 11:10.237
Uh-huh.

11:10.306 --> 11:11.505
You don't understand.

11:11.574 --> 11:13.407
My mother has cancer,

11:13.476 --> 11:15.142
she's fighting for her life.

11:15.211 --> 11:17.812
My father has recently been
laid off from the factory

11:17.880 --> 11:19.614
where he worked for 35 years.

11:19.682 --> 11:22.516
They barely have enough money
for the both of them to eat,

11:22.585 --> 11:24.085
let alone to pay the mortgage

11:24.153 --> 11:26.954
and a mountain of medical bills.

11:27.924 --> 11:29.924
Yes, I understand that the hospital

11:29.993 --> 11:31.525
has a lien on the house,

11:31.594 --> 11:34.729
but my nephews and nieces
live in that house too.

11:35.498 --> 11:37.932
Taking that house away
means that you are putting

11:38.001 --> 11:40.668
three generations out on the street.

11:40.737 --> 11:44.739
Listen, I wish that I could
speak to you in person,

11:44.807 --> 11:47.108
but I'm currently stationed overseas.

11:48.511 --> 11:50.177
That's correct, sir.

11:50.246 --> 11:53.447
I'm in the United States Army.

11:53.516 --> 11:56.150
Thank you.

11:56.219 --> 12:00.354
Okay, I can get you $1,500
by the first of the month.

12:01.824 --> 12:04.025
All right, what's the total amount owed?

12:05.828 --> 12:08.362
$152,000?

12:08.431 --> 12:11.766
That's 12 grand more
than it was a month ago!

12:13.536 --> 12:15.369
Interest?

12:17.106 --> 12:21.709
Listen to me, you ice cold motherfucker,

12:21.778 --> 12:24.178
this is straight up goddamn robbery!

12:26.416 --> 12:29.050
I don't give a shit if this
call is being recorded!

12:29.118 --> 12:30.918
I'm glad it's being recorded!

12:30.987 --> 12:33.421
I want you to play it back
over and over again

12:33.489 --> 12:35.356
so you can be reminded of how deeply

12:35.425 --> 12:38.025
I'm gonna fuck you when
I get back stateside!

12:38.094 --> 12:40.394
Do you hear me? Hello?

12:44.934 --> 12:47.435
The hell y'all looking at?

12:53.936 --> 12:56.001
Hey, can we talk?

12:57.405 --> 12:59.205
Does it have anything
to do with the mission

12:59.206 --> 13:00.539
we're about to go on?

13:00.608 --> 13:02.608
Not exactly.

13:02.677 --> 13:04.176
Then no, we can't talk.

13:04.245 --> 13:06.178
This is just business hours only.

13:06.247 --> 13:08.114
Let me focus on my shit
and you focus on yours,

13:08.182 --> 13:10.015
and let's get this thing over with.

13:11.419 --> 13:13.953
- We're gonna fix this, amigo.
- You hear me?

13:18.292 --> 13:20.960
- Should I get you a vest too?
- No, thank you.

13:21.028 --> 13:22.862
Guessing you've been
through this before.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.631
That vest looks like it's been around.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.299
We, uh, we ready to go, fellas?

13:27.368 --> 13:28.934
Always ready, sir.

13:29.003 --> 13:32.238
- May I make one suggestion?
- Yeah, absolutely.

13:32.306 --> 13:34.266
You're the pros here. I'm
just along for the ride.

13:34.267 --> 13:35.841
Quick fashion tip for the next time

13:35.910 --> 13:38.344
you find yourself outside the wire,

13:38.412 --> 13:39.712
try wearing camouflage.

13:39.781 --> 13:41.447
Oxfords and chinos stand out.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.649
You don't wanna make
yourself an easy target.

13:43.718 --> 13:46.218
I told you, Ryan.

13:46.287 --> 13:47.887
He doesn't listen to anybody.

13:47.955 --> 13:49.822
Don't worry, we'll be up in the air,

13:49.891 --> 13:52.024
so if you die, we all die with you.

13:52.727 --> 13:56.662
Crash's sense of humor runs
a bit toward the dark side.

13:56.731 --> 13:59.064
They... they call you Crash?

13:59.133 --> 14:01.567
Interesting nickname for a pilot.

14:01.636 --> 14:03.903
Three tours, three crashes.

14:04.772 --> 14:06.572
Statistical anomaly.

14:31.966 --> 14:34.500
Oh, my goodness.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.902
How you holding up?

14:38.639 --> 14:42.474
We need to land this thing.
I gotta catch my breath.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.343
That's not really on the itinerary.

14:44.412 --> 14:47.379
It is now.

14:47.448 --> 14:51.083
Crash! Down.

15:07.301 --> 15:09.335
- Is everything okay?
- It is all good.

15:09.403 --> 15:11.036
Okay.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.972
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have, uh...

15:13.040 --> 15:15.574
It is not on you. I mean, it is you.

15:15.643 --> 15:16.876
I should go.

15:16.944 --> 15:18.510
No! No, no, no, no.

15:18.579 --> 15:19.879
I...

15:19.947 --> 15:21.614
I will explain.

15:21.682 --> 15:23.816
I'll explain.

15:26.153 --> 15:30.256
When I was a university
student in Hamburg,

15:30.324 --> 15:33.559
I was with a girl who reminded
me very much of you.

15:33.628 --> 15:37.329
We were to get married,
but it was called off.

15:37.398 --> 15:38.831
What happened?

15:38.900 --> 15:40.966
She wanted to have sexual relations

15:41.035 --> 15:42.968
before committing to a
lifetime of monogamy,

15:43.037 --> 15:45.604
but because of my religious beliefs,

15:45.673 --> 15:47.106
I could not.

15:53.147 --> 15:55.748
So you're a virgin?

15:55.816 --> 15:58.050
The answer is technically yes.

15:58.119 --> 16:00.352
Jesus.

16:10.298 --> 16:12.531
I can't... I don't think I can do this.

16:14.502 --> 16:16.535
I understand.

16:16.604 --> 16:18.170
No.

16:18.239 --> 16:20.239
No, you're not supposed to understand.

16:20.308 --> 16:21.908
You're supposed to
throw all your beliefs

16:21.943 --> 16:23.509
to the wind like I'm doing.

16:23.577 --> 16:25.777
If my parents were alive
and could take a look at you,

16:25.845 --> 16:27.165
you would realize that is exactly

16:27.180 --> 16:29.548
what I am doing as well.

16:29.617 --> 16:31.984
Where are you going?

16:32.053 --> 16:34.553
Back to my regularly scheduled life

16:34.622 --> 16:36.455
to see if it's worth throwing away

16:36.524 --> 16:39.091
for a boy that I can't even
get past second base with.

16:43.497 --> 16:46.432
I am so sorry.

16:59.213 --> 17:01.347
Another pro tip.

17:01.415 --> 17:04.215
If you got a weak stomach,
eat bananas before you fly.

17:04.285 --> 17:07.886
They taste the same coming
back up as they do going down

17:07.954 --> 17:10.521
Good to know.

17:10.590 --> 17:13.058
- Sir, stay close.
- Yeah, of course.

17:13.127 --> 17:15.594
Just need to get a little fresh air.

17:29.844 --> 17:32.077
Not nearly as terrible as
they make it out to be, huh?

17:32.146 --> 17:34.480
No. No, no, no.

17:38.285 --> 17:40.319
Our time here has been a struggle,

17:40.388 --> 17:42.068
but it will have been
worth it when we help

17:42.069 --> 17:46.091
rid this beautiful country
of the terrorist insurgents

17:46.160 --> 17:48.193
whose stated mission is to bring down

17:48.262 --> 17:51.397
our American way of life.

17:51.465 --> 17:53.198
Yeah.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.701
While we're on the
subject, Mr. Secretary,

17:55.770 --> 17:58.003
there are some damn fine soldiers

17:58.072 --> 17:59.805
who lay their lives
on the line every day

17:59.874 --> 18:01.306
to support that mission.

18:01.375 --> 18:04.410
They just happen to
be born on foreign soil.

18:04.478 --> 18:06.278
But they're as American as you and I.

18:06.347 --> 18:07.913
I'm well aware of them, son,

18:07.982 --> 18:10.482
and I'm thankful for their sacrifice.

18:14.889 --> 18:16.249
Why do you wanna get rid of them?

18:16.250 --> 18:18.657
As I stated earlier,

18:18.726 --> 18:21.760
this is neither the time
nor the place to discuss it,

18:21.829 --> 18:23.996
but I will say there are serious

18:24.065 --> 18:26.598
national security issues at stake here

18:26.667 --> 18:29.701
that are far beyond
your level of clearance.

18:31.205 --> 18:32.738
Yeah, I doubt that, sir.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.007
Sounds to me like a way
to blame immigrants

18:35.076 --> 18:36.742
for problems created by politicians

18:36.811 --> 18:38.331
who only care about getting re-elected

18:38.379 --> 18:40.179
and not about our national security.

18:44.018 --> 18:45.517
But lucky for you,

18:45.586 --> 18:47.686
that's just one
soldier's opinion, right?

18:52.259 --> 18:55.828
Don't you ever fucking talk
to me like that again, boy.

19:05.706 --> 19:07.626
Hey, you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

19:07.675 --> 19:09.308
Well, that depends on how personal

19:09.376 --> 19:10.742
the question is gonna be.

19:10.811 --> 19:13.112
Are you a religious man?

19:13.180 --> 19:15.447
Oh, I mean, I consider
myself a devout Muslim.

19:15.516 --> 19:17.349
Although I do struggle at times,

19:17.418 --> 19:19.098
I believe Allah holds
me in his good graces

19:19.167 --> 19:21.127
because I do my best to
practice the Five Pillars.

19:21.128 --> 19:22.488
The Five Pillars?

19:22.556 --> 19:24.957
We declare our submission to Allah,

19:25.025 --> 19:26.492
give to those in need,

19:26.560 --> 19:28.360
um, fast during the month of Ramadan,

19:28.429 --> 19:30.095
and to make pilgrimage to Mecca.

19:30.164 --> 19:31.730
That's four.

19:31.799 --> 19:33.198
Um...

19:33.267 --> 19:34.933
we pray five times a day.

19:35.002 --> 19:36.468
I've never seen you pray ever.

19:36.537 --> 19:38.177
Yeah, well, I am not perfect, all right?

19:38.178 --> 19:40.506
All right, well...

19:40.574 --> 19:42.307
what about sex?

19:42.376 --> 19:45.577
Oh, um, that's a little
bit more complicated,

19:45.646 --> 19:48.080
but essentially, sex is
reserved for marriage.

19:48.149 --> 19:49.829
You were abstinent
until you got married?

19:49.830 --> 19:50.983
No! No, no, God, no.

19:51.051 --> 19:52.551
No, I went to university in Cambridge

19:52.620 --> 19:54.660
and I shagged pretty much
everything with a clitoris

19:54.722 --> 19:56.155
before I met my wife.

19:56.223 --> 19:57.556
And she doesn't know?

19:57.625 --> 19:59.625
She did the same, with men, of course.

19:59.693 --> 20:02.694
One of the many reasons why she
and I were made for one other.

20:02.763 --> 20:05.597
Seriously though, one's
commitment to the Five Pillars

20:05.666 --> 20:07.666
is a real test of their character

20:07.735 --> 20:10.068
and a clear indication
that they're made of

20:10.137 --> 20:13.138
much sterner stuff than I.

20:13.207 --> 20:14.806
Nice to see you taking such interest

20:14.875 --> 20:16.141
in the local culture, though.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.677
May I ask why all of a sudden?

20:18.746 --> 20:20.712
You may not.

20:21.815 --> 20:23.515
Okay then!

20:23.584 --> 20:26.351
Didn't realize that young man over there

20:26.420 --> 20:29.621
who was coming at me with
both barrels is your husband.

20:29.690 --> 20:32.391
Not really relevant information, sir.

20:32.459 --> 20:36.261
It would've explained why he
was in such an emotional state.

20:37.331 --> 20:39.565
He obviously loves you a great deal.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.200
Would it have made a difference?

20:41.268 --> 20:43.168
To me? Yes.

20:43.237 --> 20:44.836
To the situation? No.

20:44.905 --> 20:46.605
That's what I thought, sir.

20:46.674 --> 20:49.141
I feel as though you have
a better understanding

20:49.210 --> 20:51.276
of the bigger picture than he does.

20:51.345 --> 20:54.112
- I'm afraid so.
- We should probably head back.

20:54.181 --> 20:55.614
No, no. One last photo.

20:58.852 --> 21:00.118
Contact rear!

21:00.187 --> 21:01.620
- I'm shot!
- Keep your head down!

21:01.689 --> 21:03.889
Guardian Main, Dustoff
3-1 is taking fire.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.959
- Smoke out!
- Conducting rapid exfil, over!

21:10.397 --> 21:11.430
Come on!

21:11.498 --> 21:12.864
Come on, come on, come on!

21:24.411 --> 21:25.931
Bullet went straight though the vest.

21:25.932 --> 21:27.746
Milton!

21:32.253 --> 21:33.552
He's dead.

21:33.621 --> 21:35.454
Come on.

21:35.522 --> 21:37.256
Oh, good God.

21:46.934 --> 21:48.900
We got two. One KIA, gunshot wound.

21:48.969 --> 21:51.670
Second also sustained a gunshot wound.

21:51.739 --> 21:53.672
Entry and exit through the right arm.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.220
Tourniquet applied, currently stable.

21:55.275 --> 21:56.275
All right, copy that.

21:56.303 --> 21:57.783
Get a CAT scan, prep him for surgery.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.651
Sì, Captain.

22:03.984 --> 22:05.550
What the hell went down out there?

22:05.619 --> 22:07.986
He insisted on touching down.

22:08.055 --> 22:11.390
We took 'em to what was up
until this point a safe spot.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.326
We met a sniper who changed all that.

22:15.529 --> 22:17.195
Is he gonna be okay?

22:17.264 --> 22:18.797
He's pretty lucky.

22:18.866 --> 22:20.586
Can't say the same for
our other ride-along.

22:23.370 --> 22:26.371
I have to go make some calls.

22:39.186 --> 22:41.986
Look, Goodall was the one
who insisted on touching down.

22:42.055 --> 22:43.455
I tried to talk him out of it.

22:43.524 --> 22:45.324
Yeah, but it was your
idea to go up with him

22:45.325 --> 22:46.558
in the first place.

22:46.627 --> 22:49.108
I honestly thought it would
help you to talk to the guy.

22:49.109 --> 22:50.195
How was I supposed to know

22:50.224 --> 22:51.664
we were gonna come under enemy fire?

22:51.665 --> 22:54.566
- Always a possibility.
- Well, yeah.

22:54.635 --> 22:56.335
Doesn't really matter though.

22:56.403 --> 22:57.843
We're all gonna catch flak for this.

22:57.871 --> 22:59.538
I told you to leave it alone.

22:59.607 --> 23:01.541
There was no good that
could have come out of it.

23:01.542 --> 23:02.742
Jesus, I was trying to help!

23:02.776 --> 23:04.109
You're always trying to help,

23:04.178 --> 23:05.418
but it always ends in disaster.

23:05.419 --> 23:06.912
No comment.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.613
Well, there's nothing we do now

23:08.682 --> 23:10.482
except wait and see what happens.

23:10.551 --> 23:13.385
I'll take the heat for this myself.

23:13.454 --> 23:15.120
You were right.

23:15.189 --> 23:16.588
It's my idea to go up with him.

23:16.657 --> 23:17.989
I'll be the one who goes down.

23:18.058 --> 23:20.492
Not really up to you who goes down.

23:20.561 --> 23:22.394
What's done is done.

23:22.463 --> 23:24.796
Unfortunately.

23:26.133 --> 23:28.734
- I can fix this.
- Enough!

23:28.802 --> 23:31.870
You're always trying to fix everything!

23:31.939 --> 23:35.640
Some shit can't be fixed,
and that's just the way it is!

23:35.709 --> 23:37.743
I've been going along
with you all this time,

23:37.811 --> 23:40.178
and it's gotten me nowhere.

23:40.247 --> 23:42.247
Not only am I still fucked,

23:42.316 --> 23:43.716
but after each one of your "fixes",

23:43.784 --> 23:46.618
I end up somehow more
fucked than I was before.

23:49.089 --> 23:50.689
I guess I should feel lucky.

23:50.758 --> 23:54.926
At least I'm not dead, but I am out.

24:00.701 --> 24:02.801
You wanna lay into me now too?

24:04.371 --> 24:06.538
I don't need to.

24:22.683 --> 24:25.682
I don't give a shit if this
call is being recorded!

24:25.751 --> 24:27.384
I'm glad it's being recorded!

24:27.453 --> 24:29.720
I want you to play it
back over and over again

24:29.789 --> 24:31.488
so you can be reminded of how deeply

24:31.557 --> 24:34.191
I'm gonna fuck you when
I get back stateside!

24:34.260 --> 24:37.027
Do you hear me? Hello?

24:37.496 --> 24:40.197
Look, I'm sorry for
losing my temper, sir,

24:40.265 --> 24:42.999
but you have to understand,

24:43.068 --> 24:44.768
my family is in a really bad spot,

24:44.837 --> 24:47.170
and I feel like I've been
fighting every step of the way

24:47.239 --> 24:49.072
trying to make things right for them.

24:49.141 --> 24:51.341
This behavior is totally inappropriate

24:51.410 --> 24:53.310
and unbecoming of a
non-commissioned officer

24:53.378 --> 24:54.778
in the U.S. Army.

24:54.847 --> 24:56.527
You should know better
than this, Sergeant.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.747
It only happened once.

24:57.816 --> 24:59.483
It won't happen again. I promise.

24:59.551 --> 25:01.518
Only once?

25:01.587 --> 25:03.687
Had time to cut together some selects.

25:03.755 --> 25:05.722
A greatest hits of your
telephone meltdowns,

25:05.791 --> 25:07.157
if you will.

25:07.226 --> 25:08.825
Look, dickhead,

25:08.894 --> 25:10.894
do you want the fucking money or not?

25:10.963 --> 25:12.462
If you won't take a check,

25:12.531 --> 25:14.297
I can give you a boot in your ass.

25:14.366 --> 25:15.966
Dealer's choice, motherfucker.

25:16.034 --> 25:17.534
What?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.669
We're not asking for a handout, man!

25:19.738 --> 25:22.439
What is your fucking malfunction!

25:22.508 --> 25:24.674
No, I don't wanna speak to your manager.

25:24.743 --> 25:27.611
I do want to put my hands
around your neck, though.

25:29.248 --> 25:32.015
We've received a number
of formal complaints.

25:32.084 --> 25:33.604
Are you aware that civilian misconduct

25:33.652 --> 25:35.132
can lead to a dishonorable discharge?

25:35.187 --> 25:36.720
I'm fully aware, sir.

25:36.749 --> 25:38.789
Well, then remove your head
from your ass, Sergeant,

25:38.790 --> 25:41.071
Because if you get slapped
with a negative separation code

25:41.072 --> 25:42.592
showing financial irresponsibility

25:42.661 --> 25:45.161
or reckless behavior on your DD-214,

25:45.190 --> 25:46.750
a 19-year-old community college dropout

25:46.751 --> 25:48.265
is going to be giving you orders

25:48.333 --> 25:49.973
while you work the
fry station at Wendy's.

25:51.236 --> 25:53.270
Is there no way for the Army to help me?

25:53.338 --> 25:55.005
You're looking at your help.

25:55.073 --> 25:57.908
The Army is providing you
with an attorney pro bono,

25:57.976 --> 26:00.076
and my free legal advice to you

26:00.145 --> 26:02.612
is never threaten another
civilian with bodily harm again

26:02.681 --> 26:04.548
or you'll be facing a military trial,

26:04.616 --> 26:07.150
and most probably
a civilian suit as well.

26:10.656 --> 26:13.990
Where did you get this rug?

26:14.693 --> 26:17.227
It's all a simple misunderstanding.

26:17.296 --> 26:19.329
What he was even doing to rugs?

26:19.398 --> 26:20.697
The poor kid was trying to earn

26:20.766 --> 26:22.699
a few extra bucks for his family.

26:22.768 --> 26:24.768
His folks own an antique
store in West Texas,

26:24.836 --> 26:28.371
and these Afghan rugs
go for a big premium.

26:28.440 --> 26:31.408
Buckley would sneak off
base, buy or trade for 'em,

26:31.476 --> 26:33.677
and then ship 'em home.

26:33.745 --> 26:37.280
He was a smart kid.
Mad I didn't think of it.

26:37.349 --> 26:40.784
Maybe for the better
because you are still alive.

26:42.754 --> 26:45.021
Do you know where the rest
of them are by any chance?

26:45.090 --> 26:47.290
They sit in storage unit,

26:47.359 --> 26:50.727
so each of my nurses grab
one to cheer up CHU.

26:50.796 --> 26:54.531
I could, um, show you where
the rest are if you would like.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.967
I would like.

27:15.619 --> 27:16.819
You should probably know

27:16.888 --> 27:19.722
Sasquatch and I aren't together anymore.

27:19.791 --> 27:20.990
What?

27:21.059 --> 27:23.426
Roback! Get your ass in here!

27:35.440 --> 27:37.240
Permission to speak, sir.

27:38.510 --> 27:39.842
Permission granted.

27:39.911 --> 27:41.344
Look, I just wanted to clarify

27:41.413 --> 27:42.912
that this was all my idea,

27:42.981 --> 27:44.747
taking the Secretary up in the bird.

27:44.816 --> 27:46.115
And that nobody from my crew

27:46.184 --> 27:47.784
except me should be held responsible...

27:47.852 --> 27:49.812
That's not what this
meeting is about, Sergeant.

27:49.813 --> 27:52.013
At ease.

27:53.224 --> 27:55.058
The Secretary understands
that anything can

27:55.126 --> 27:56.793
and does happen in a war zone.

27:56.861 --> 27:58.861
He mourns the loss of his friend,

27:58.930 --> 28:00.129
but between you and me,

28:00.198 --> 28:01.678
he's happy to embrace the battle cred

28:01.733 --> 28:03.633
this whole incident has given him.

28:03.701 --> 28:05.001
So what's this all about, sir?

28:05.070 --> 28:06.636
I read your After Action Report

28:06.704 --> 28:08.538
from the day Buckley died.

28:08.606 --> 28:11.641
Are there any details you
think you may have left out?

28:11.709 --> 28:13.409
Not that I'm aware of, sir.

28:13.478 --> 28:16.145
Hm.

28:16.214 --> 28:18.147
I recently got ahold of
one of SecCorp's reports

28:18.216 --> 28:21.350
from the same day, in the same village.

28:21.419 --> 28:22.885
According to them,

28:22.914 --> 28:24.394
they were ambushed by hostile forces,

28:24.395 --> 28:25.955
which is an interesting development.

28:25.978 --> 28:27.858
Buckley wasn't where he
was supposed to be, sir,

28:27.859 --> 28:29.258
but he was in full battle rattle,

28:29.327 --> 28:31.007
so there's no way he
could've been mistaken

28:31.008 --> 28:32.095
for an enemy combatant,

28:32.163 --> 28:33.896
and he certainly wasn't a threat.

28:33.965 --> 28:36.032
Neither was Qasem, that
LN that we brought in,

28:36.101 --> 28:38.021
or anybody else from the
village for that matter.

28:38.022 --> 28:39.035
That's what I thought.

28:39.104 --> 28:40.470
Heard them mentioning something

28:40.538 --> 28:41.804
about clearing the entire area.

28:41.873 --> 28:43.172
It probably had something to do

28:43.241 --> 28:44.761
with what we stumbled upon that night.

28:44.776 --> 28:47.910
- What night?
- Nothing, sir.

28:47.979 --> 28:49.819
- It was nothing.
- You know something I don't.

28:49.820 --> 28:52.048
- Spit it out, Sergeant.
- No, I'm mistaken, sir.

28:52.117 --> 28:54.183
Look, what I know, you
know. It's all in my report.

28:56.121 --> 28:58.121
Fighting and winning a
war is difficult enough

28:58.189 --> 28:59.856
without having these mercenaries

28:59.924 --> 29:03.126
conducting their own black
ops in the middle of it.

29:03.194 --> 29:05.328
You need anything else from me, sir?

29:06.631 --> 29:08.531
That's all for now, Sergeant.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.533
Dismissed.

29:10.602 --> 29:12.869
Sir.

29:16.908 --> 29:19.041
You and Sasquatch broke
up? What happened?

29:19.110 --> 29:20.876
Corporal!

29:20.945 --> 29:22.411
You need to go.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.547
I'll be outside.

29:40.098 --> 29:42.298
- Why are you here?
- Is this a bad time?

29:42.367 --> 29:44.534
Actually, I don't care
if it's a bad time.

29:44.602 --> 29:46.035
I really need to speak to you.

29:46.104 --> 29:48.438
- Come inside.
- Okay.

29:49.908 --> 29:51.228
What you are doing is dangerous.

29:51.229 --> 29:52.809
Not for me, but for you.

29:52.877 --> 29:54.444
I'm willing to do whatever you want,

29:54.512 --> 29:56.779
and I realize this thing is
engineered to self-destruct,

29:56.848 --> 29:58.314
but I don't care.

29:58.383 --> 30:00.650
- Perhaps you should care.
- But I don't.

30:00.718 --> 30:02.151
I mean, look at me,

30:02.220 --> 30:04.053
I'm sneaking off base in a war zone

30:04.122 --> 30:05.621
to hold hands with someone

30:05.690 --> 30:07.223
my father would never approve of.

30:07.292 --> 30:08.891
I feel like a teenager.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.194
What exactly did you
come here to say to me?

30:11.262 --> 30:14.630
If waiting is what you
want or need, it's fine.

30:14.699 --> 30:16.332
I'll survive.

30:16.401 --> 30:18.568
Believe me, just imagining
us having sex does the trick

30:18.636 --> 30:19.902
and then some.

30:19.971 --> 30:21.838
And I'm not saying
I'll convert to Islam,

30:21.906 --> 30:24.740
but I am willing to meet you halfway.

30:24.809 --> 30:26.809
And where is halfway to Islam?

30:26.878 --> 30:29.278
I have no idea.

30:29.347 --> 30:30.787
But whatever it is we're doing here,

30:30.849 --> 30:32.448
I want to keep doing it. Do you?

30:32.517 --> 30:35.218
Yes. Very much.

30:39.791 --> 30:41.824
I was hoping you'd say that.

30:44.863 --> 30:46.295
Let's make it quick.

30:46.364 --> 30:48.284
We've got about five
minutes before shift change.

30:48.333 --> 30:49.966
Talk to me.

30:50.034 --> 30:52.001
Found out Sasquatch
took a dive in the fight.

30:53.304 --> 30:55.771
That fucking asshole. You kidding me?

30:55.840 --> 30:58.207
Mm-hmm, that was pretty
much my response too.

30:59.978 --> 31:03.179
I feel totally responsible for
you guys losing all your money.

31:03.248 --> 31:05.047
It's fine.

31:05.116 --> 31:07.216
You didn't know, right?

31:08.520 --> 31:10.920
I would try and keep this from
reaching Davis's ears, though.

31:10.921 --> 31:12.655
Got it.

31:12.724 --> 31:14.891
Why are you telling me all of this?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.840
You trying to get me
back? Is that what this is?

31:16.841 --> 31:17.960
No.

31:18.029 --> 31:19.409
You're still married to Alvarez,

31:19.464 --> 31:20.997
and she still needs that green card.

31:21.065 --> 31:22.999
We can't be seen together.

31:23.067 --> 31:24.267
- Ever.
- If you recall,

31:24.335 --> 31:26.235
we were pretty good at
not being seen together.

31:26.304 --> 31:29.172
Not nearly as good as
we thought we were.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.941
I don't know if I can accept that.

31:32.010 --> 31:34.343
Maybe it's time to.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.949
You're late.

31:41.119 --> 31:43.453
Hey man, I need to re-up on those M18s.

31:43.522 --> 31:45.888
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks.

31:47.725 --> 31:50.493
The bullet shattered your humerus.

31:50.562 --> 31:51.994
Now I regret to inform you

31:52.063 --> 31:53.796
that it's not going to
be an easy recovery.

31:53.865 --> 31:55.465
You're probably going to be dealing with

31:55.494 --> 31:57.334
the residual effects
for the rest of your life.

31:57.335 --> 31:58.801
And that's the good news?

31:58.870 --> 32:00.570
- In this instance, yes.
- Hm.

32:00.638 --> 32:03.172
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Corporal.

32:03.241 --> 32:05.274
I need the Secretary's
scans and medical chart

32:05.343 --> 32:07.510
sent directly on to Walter
Reed Medical Center.

32:07.579 --> 32:09.845
You're the only one that I
trust to make sure it happens.

32:09.914 --> 32:11.514
- On it, sir.
- Very good.

32:11.583 --> 32:12.848
Try to get some rest.

32:12.917 --> 32:14.884
You've got a long journey ahead of you.

32:14.953 --> 32:16.986
Corporal.

32:18.556 --> 32:20.056
Yes, sir?

32:20.124 --> 32:23.626
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.

32:23.695 --> 32:26.262
Do you know why you're here?

32:26.331 --> 32:28.431
To transfer your scans
and medical chart to...

32:28.499 --> 32:31.567
No, I mean in Afghanistan.

32:31.636 --> 32:34.904
Do you know why you're
here in Afghanistan?

32:36.507 --> 32:39.175
I believe we're here to stop
the threat of terrorism.

32:39.244 --> 32:41.777
And do you think that goal
is being accomplished?

32:41.846 --> 32:43.446
I can't really tell, sir.

32:45.783 --> 32:47.984
Neither can I,

32:48.052 --> 32:50.419
and that's sort of my job.

32:51.956 --> 32:53.396
I'm sure you'll figure it out, sir.

32:53.397 --> 32:56.464
That makes one of us.

32:58.463 --> 33:00.129
Is that all, sir?

33:00.198 --> 33:03.399
Unfortunately that just
about covers it, Corporal.

33:23.641 --> 33:25.721
Those are some gorgeous
looking rugs you got there.

33:25.722 --> 33:27.510
Yeah, my mom's a collector,

33:27.578 --> 33:30.246
so figured I'd surprise
her for her birthday.

33:30.314 --> 33:33.182
Go ahead and fill these out
while I get these weighed.

33:33.251 --> 33:36.018
- Where they off to?
- Chicago, Illinois.

33:39.690 --> 33:42.091
Sergeant Davis.

33:42.159 --> 33:43.425
What do you need, Private?

33:43.494 --> 33:46.495
I need a money order for $5,000.

33:46.564 --> 33:49.365
Tell me you didn't buy
one of those cars.

33:50.501 --> 33:52.801
Yeah, well, I... I
can't tell you I didn't

33:52.870 --> 33:54.436
because I did.

33:54.505 --> 33:57.072
Petrocelli, those
dealerships are a scam.

33:57.141 --> 33:58.941
Everybody knows it.

33:59.010 --> 34:00.676
They set up shop here on the base

34:00.745 --> 34:03.646
to target naive young soldiers
on their first deployment.

34:03.714 --> 34:05.180
Why would they do that?

34:05.249 --> 34:07.483
Because the car companies
pay off somebody

34:07.552 --> 34:09.885
at the Pentagon, and kids
like you got nothing better

34:09.954 --> 34:12.321
to spend your money on out
here in the middle of the desert.

34:12.389 --> 34:16.391
The car salesman gave me
a $500 military discount,

34:16.460 --> 34:19.295
and a very low interest rate of 20%.

34:19.931 --> 34:22.431
That's not a low interest rate.

34:23.301 --> 34:25.261
Uh, give me a sec for
that money order, Private.

34:25.262 --> 34:26.569
And, uh, Sergeant,

34:26.637 --> 34:28.871
you're looking at nearly
100 pounds on those rugs.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.179
It's gonna be pricey to send 'em

34:30.181 --> 34:32.308
all the way back to the States.

34:32.376 --> 34:35.844
Wait, you found Buckley's rugs?

34:36.581 --> 34:38.213
You sending these back to his family?

34:38.282 --> 34:39.722
- Well, well...
- That is so awesome.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.952
You are a really good
person, Sergeant Davis.

34:43.020 --> 34:44.699
And I... I don't mean
just on the outside,

34:44.701 --> 34:47.467
I mean in here on the inside.

34:48.559 --> 34:51.226
A really good person.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.030
You mind if I just do this over here?

34:55.099 --> 34:57.466
Sure, lemme just look
how much this'll cost.

34:57.535 --> 34:59.301
You said it's going
to Chicago, Illinois?

34:59.370 --> 35:00.703
Yeah.

35:00.771 --> 35:02.471
That's not where Buckley lives.

35:02.540 --> 35:04.173
He's from Texas.

35:04.241 --> 35:07.009
He actually has
extended family all over.

35:07.078 --> 35:09.478
Huh. Really?

35:09.547 --> 35:11.347
Yeah.

35:11.415 --> 35:13.282
Hmm. Cool.

35:14.251 --> 35:17.119
You know what, uh, tell them I said hey.

35:18.556 --> 35:21.290
Not a day goes by that I
don't think about their son.

35:22.727 --> 35:24.627
I will.

35:43.814 --> 35:46.815
Hey.

35:46.884 --> 35:48.584
Could you look up the address

35:48.653 --> 35:51.854
of a John Buckley in Texas who was KIA?

35:51.922 --> 35:54.490
I wanna reroute the shipment.

36:17.949 --> 36:19.449
Here you go, sir.

36:20.551 --> 36:22.785
You wanted to see us, sir?

36:22.853 --> 36:24.319
Yes.

36:24.388 --> 36:26.889
I want to thank you
both for saving my life.

36:26.957 --> 36:28.957
It's what we get paid for, sir.

36:29.026 --> 36:30.793
America would be better off

36:30.861 --> 36:33.395
if more immigrants
were like you, Sergeant.

36:33.464 --> 36:35.631
- They are, sir.
- I know.

36:35.700 --> 36:38.434
That said though, if even
one foreign national

36:38.502 --> 36:40.969
has ulterior motives amongst your rank,

36:41.038 --> 36:42.304
that's one too many.

36:42.373 --> 36:44.073
After what happened at Fort Hood,

36:44.141 --> 36:45.541
we can't have that risk anymore.

36:45.609 --> 36:48.010
If you don't mind my saying so,

36:48.079 --> 36:49.912
that is seriously flawed logic.

36:49.980 --> 36:51.947
Not from where I'm standing.

36:52.016 --> 36:53.582
Sorry to hear that, sir.

36:53.651 --> 36:55.951
Um, the helicopter's ready for you, sir.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.753
Right.

36:59.190 --> 37:01.990
Thank you for your service, Sergeant.

37:02.059 --> 37:03.759
I wish you the best.

37:05.129 --> 37:06.849
If you really wanted
to wish her the best,

37:06.850 --> 37:08.797
you'd help her!

37:08.866 --> 37:10.265
When everyone wants to know

37:10.334 --> 37:11.767
what the hell went down out there,

37:11.836 --> 37:13.235
I will not tell them

37:13.304 --> 37:15.771
that your little joyride
ended in the death

37:15.840 --> 37:17.406
of my good friend.

37:17.475 --> 37:21.276
I will instead speak well of you both

37:21.345 --> 37:24.880
because I admire your wife's
bravery and good sense.

37:26.717 --> 37:31.120
You are a lucky man, Sergeant,
in more ways than one.

37:47.505 --> 37:49.838
Sorry.

37:58.115 --> 38:01.583
Here I was trying to save you,
and you end up saving me.

38:01.652 --> 38:03.685
One of these days we're
gonna have to learn

38:03.754 --> 38:05.788
to save ourselves.

38:05.856 --> 38:08.290
Yeah.

38:24.408 --> 38:25.974
Welcome to our family.

38:26.043 --> 38:27.409
Your bonus check will clear

38:27.478 --> 38:28.878
as soon as your paperwork processes

38:28.913 --> 38:32.281
and we receive proper
documentation for your ETS.

38:32.349 --> 38:35.551
Just a few months left.

38:35.619 --> 38:37.539
You're about to come into
a great deal of money

38:37.607 --> 38:39.967
for doing what you're already
doing for practically nothing.

38:39.968 --> 38:42.615
That's the fucking plan.

38:43.561 --> 38:45.227
All right, we'll be in touch.

38:49.366 --> 38:50.866
I'd love to be a fly on the wall

38:50.935 --> 38:52.367
when he breaks the news to Roback.

38:52.436 --> 38:54.269
What makes you so
sure he hasn't already?

38:54.338 --> 38:55.971
I'm sure.
