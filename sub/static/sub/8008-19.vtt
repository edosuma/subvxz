- (RAIN POURING)
- It makes me feel some type of way.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.649
How about you pause that stormin' for a sec
so you can hear the rest of it?

10:02.644 --> 10:03.896
(RAIN, THUNDER STOP)

10:04.020 --> 10:05.272
(IMITATES BIRDS CHIRPING)

10:05.396 --> 10:07.148
Wait. Wait, wait. That one. What's that one?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.280
(CAWING)

10:09.609 --> 10:11.532
No, no, no. That "tweet-tweet" one.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.909
- (IMITATES BIRDS CHIRPING)
- Yes! Ohh...

10:13.905 --> 10:17.409
I haven't heard that sound
since I was a baby breeze.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.913
What? You forgot what a bird sounds like?
No wonder you're depressed!

10:21.037 --> 10:23.415
You know, you should really stop
and slow down more often.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.167
Yeah. You get to hear life happening.
Makes you feel good.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.049
(INHALES DEEPLY)

10:28.044 --> 10:29.671
(DEEP SIGH)

10:29.921 --> 10:32.299
You're right!
I've been a freaky storm for so long

10:32.423 --> 10:34.926
that I forgot it's okay
to be a breeze sometimes.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.553
If you'll excuse me,

10:36.553 --> 10:39.523
I'm going to explore
the rest of this beautiful day.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.313
Wait! Here, man. Take my notebook.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.310
It's got the sheet music to my jam.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.567
Really? You would do that?

10:46.688 --> 10:47.940
Yeah, just take it.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.316
(WIND HOWLING)

10:49.399 --> 10:52.073
Thank you so much, stretchy dog.

10:52.152 --> 10:56.453
This is one of the nicest things
anyone's ever clone for me.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.574
Outey!

11:00.285 --> 11:01.832
Yes! The sun!

11:01.911 --> 11:03.083
Hoo-hoo!

11:03.079 --> 11:05.582
I am sorry we doubted you, Jake.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.834
Ditto.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.460
Proud of you, man.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.339
- (EAGLE SCREECHES)
- (SCREAMS)

11:15.175 --> 11:18.179
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:18.928 --> 11:22.558
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.352 --> 11:28.354
This party is so crazy!
