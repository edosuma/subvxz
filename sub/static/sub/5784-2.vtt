00:49.182 --> 00:51.950
â™ª

00:49.182 --> 00:51.950
I bagged that one
in darkest Africa.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.553
A handsome beast.
Ferocious, I'd wager.

00:54.555 --> 00:58.524
Africa? I thought tigers
were native to India.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.827
You could be right, my dear.
Africa, India,

01:01.829 --> 01:04.263
it is terribly hard
to tell them apart.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.299
Now this beggar is a different
story altogether.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.335
He was two hundred yards away
if he was an inch.

01:15.975 --> 01:18.444
Remind me again
as to why we are here.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.913
The guest speaker.
Who is?

01:20.915 --> 01:24.383
That's the exciting part.
It's a surprise.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.652
(sighing)

01:26.654 --> 01:28.821
Thank you.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.025
(laughing)

01:33.027 --> 01:35.027
I do appreciate this,
Clarence.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.029
Appreciate what?
Your sponsorship.

01:37.031 --> 01:39.331
Oh, not a bother.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.201
This club could use a few men
of your forthrightness.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.404
We're all getting a bit
stodgy in our old age.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.940
(laughing)
Well, I want you to know

01:47.942 --> 01:49.975
that we're both
delighted.

01:49.977 --> 01:53.445
When will Thomas know
if he's been accepted?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.447
If my husband
sponsored you,

01:55.449 --> 01:58.150
acceptance is a mere formality.
Oh!

01:58.152 --> 02:00.719
Well, Clarence,

02:00.721 --> 02:03.055
do you intend on letting
the cat out of the bag?

02:03.057 --> 02:05.023
Whatever
do you mean, Dick?

02:05.025 --> 02:07.059
When are you going to tell us
who is regaling us this evening?

02:07.061 --> 02:09.061
You'll find out
soon enough.

02:09.063 --> 02:11.230
Young Benson
is fetching him now.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.799
Look at Margaret.
She looks like the cat

02:13.801 --> 02:16.835
who ate the canary.
It's not everyone

02:16.837 --> 02:21.073
who gets asked to be a member
of the Empire Club.

02:21.075 --> 02:23.609
Why would the Inspector want
to associate with them?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.644
Perhaps
it's to keep

02:25.646 --> 02:29.114
the canary eater happy?

02:29.116 --> 02:31.550
Esteemed Members
and Honoured Guests.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.653
It is my pleasure to announce
that our speaker will be here

02:34.655 --> 02:36.989
in a matter of moments. So,

02:36.991 --> 02:39.892
if you could all
take your places.

02:47.667 --> 02:51.069
Enough foolishness,
Clarence. I insist

02:51.071 --> 02:54.206
you tell us whom
we are here to hear.
All right. All right.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.109
Let me say that I have brought,

02:57.111 --> 02:59.111
at great personal expense,

02:59.113 --> 03:02.814
a most wonderful speaker
to start the series.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.517
He is an acclaimed
humourist

03:05.519 --> 03:07.953
and world renowned
travel diarist.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.556
None other than...

03:10.558 --> 03:13.358
Mark Twain.
(exclamations)

03:14.394 --> 03:16.628
Mark Twain!
Mark Twain?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.598
Have you gotten
your marbles mixed?
This is outrageous!

03:19.600 --> 03:22.968
Mark Twain. In our club?
Over my dead body.
Bugger this. I'm leaving.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.237
You intercept that scoundrel.

03:25.239 --> 03:29.208
You make sure he doesn't set
a foot in here.
Yes, sir.

03:31.844 --> 03:34.479
I'm guessing this is not
the surprise they expected.

03:34.481 --> 03:37.182
Thomas. What is going on?
I don't know.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.986
This is horrible.
He was your sponsor.
Murdoch,

03:40.988 --> 03:43.989
what's this all about?
I--
(gasping)

03:46.426 --> 03:49.661
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:49.663 --> 03:51.663
Mark Twain.

03:51.665 --> 03:55.634
(applause and booing)

03:56.970 --> 03:59.137
Go back to America, Twain.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.240
You don't belong here.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.810
Thank you.
For king and country!
You don't belong here!

04:04.812 --> 04:06.845
Ladies and gentlemen,
what a pleasure

04:06.847 --> 04:08.981
it is to be a guest

04:08.983 --> 04:10.983
in your esteemed city.
(gunshot)

04:10.985 --> 04:12.651
(gasping)

04:12.653 --> 04:15.153
Is anyone hurt?
Thomas!
Margaret, stay close.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.690
Mr. Twain.
Are you all right?

04:18.692 --> 04:21.627
I believe I will
need another drink.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.029
Splendid idea.
Oh, Thomas.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.941
.44 calibre.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.910
Please thank Doctor Ogden
for escorting Margaret home.

04:38.912 --> 04:42.514
Yes, of course. Sir, did you
hear anything of note?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.783
No one appears
to have seen anything.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.619
And you believe them?
No reason not to. We didn't.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.322
Right.
May I escort Mr. Twain

04:50.324 --> 04:52.658
back to his hotel?
Wursley, please escort

04:52.660 --> 04:55.360
the two gentlemen
back to their hotel.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.496
Mr. Twain, welcome to Canada.

04:57.498 --> 05:01.400
Well, it was a robust one.

05:01.402 --> 05:05.337
Yes. I'll be needing to ask
you further questions
in the morning.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.507
Yes. Of course.
Had you taken leave

05:08.509 --> 05:12.678
of your senses?
He is the author of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Huckleberry Finn,</i>

05:12.680 --> 05:15.681
I didn't expect...
Mr. Twain is also
the vice-president

05:15.683 --> 05:19.251
of the Anti-Imperialist League
and a critic of His Majesty.

05:19.253 --> 05:22.988
Why in God's name
did you book him?
I may not have researched him

05:22.990 --> 05:24.990
thoroughly.
You, sir,

05:24.992 --> 05:28.193
are the master
of understatement.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.862
Mr. Wilson.
Yes.
Detective William Murdoch,

05:30.864 --> 05:33.098
Toronto Constabulary.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.234
I would like a list
of all of your members
that were present this evening.

05:36.236 --> 05:39.071
You surely don't think
one of us...

05:39.073 --> 05:42.107
At the moment, no one
is above suspicion.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.610
I trust you will be
discrete about this.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.713
Of course we will, sir.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.716
I'll procure you
the list.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.718
Chin up, Thomas.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.487
I don't think this
will change anything.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.536
Mr. Fanshaw, why did you
object to Mr. Twain's presence?

06:11.538 --> 06:15.574
The man is a bounder.
Pure and simple.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.643
Could you expand on that?
Do you know what he says
about our way of life?

06:18.645 --> 06:21.513
He calls it the most
grotesque swindle

06:21.515 --> 06:23.582
ever perpetrated by man.

06:23.584 --> 06:27.452
He all but proclaims
our beloved King a Devil.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.287
So he deserves to be shot?

06:29.289 --> 06:32.224
I heard you were an ex-
military man, as am I.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.293
What do you think?

06:35.295 --> 06:39.664
Uh, well, uh...
Mr. Fanshaw.
Members of the club

06:39.666 --> 06:43.068
have stated that
you carry a weapon.
I do. What of it?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.070
May we see it?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.072
It's in my locker at the club.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.808
You are more than welcome
to examine it.

06:49.810 --> 06:53.345
But I did not shoot
at the man. In fact,

06:53.347 --> 06:57.082
I wasn't even in the room when
the scoundrel was shot at.
I was at the bar,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.851
trying to gather
my composure.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.888
Norman will vouch for me.
Gentlemen.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.661
I suppose she forgot
the date.

07:09.663 --> 07:13.165
What are you on about, Henry?
Mary Lawrence.

07:13.167 --> 07:17.469
She was to accompany me to the
musical theatre last night.
What have you got there?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.604
Oh, I had them made
after my promotion.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.674
When you were in jail.
Right. Subtle.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.643
Anyhow,

07:24.645 --> 07:27.379
I went to collect her last
night, and her flatmate said
she'd left for the evening.

07:27.381 --> 07:31.016
Mary Lawrence, this is the one
with the sick mother?
She's always sick!

07:31.018 --> 07:33.618
Every time I call on her,
her mother's on her deathbed.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.221
I suggested perhaps
she should retire

07:36.223 --> 07:38.223
to the country; perhaps
the clean air would sort--

07:38.225 --> 07:40.358
Mark Twain.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.295
Excuse me?
Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass.

07:43.297 --> 07:47.232
W. Epaminondas Adrastus Blab.
Sergeant Fathom.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.234
Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.236
Mark Twain!

07:51.238 --> 07:53.872
Mr. Twain. It's
an honour to meet you.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.874
The honour is both
yours and mine.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.909
Oh, there's no need
to say that. George Crabtree,

07:57.911 --> 08:00.846
Constable Third Class.
I used to be First Class,

08:00.848 --> 08:04.916
Constable First Class, but I
made a rather unfortunate choice
which led to a series

08:04.918 --> 08:07.686
of blunders from which I--
I'm prattling.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.988
You're here to see some
of the Detective's inventions,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.990
I'll wager.
No, no, no.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.992
Somebody shot at me yesterday.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.528
Well, it's a good thing
they missed, I should say.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.663
Mr. Twain.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.932
Thank you for coming in. George,

08:20.934 --> 08:24.536
Henry, I need you to go
to the Empire Club and search
Richard Fanshaw's locker.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.205
Sir.
What are we looking for, sir?
A gun.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.774
Preferably one
that's been recently fired.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.678
Right this way.
Good day to you, Mr. Twain.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.616
Good to meet you, son.
Henry,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.185
we've just met one
of the greatest writers
the world has ever seen.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.787
George, do you think
it might be possible

08:42.789 --> 08:45.690
that Miss Lawrence is
purposely avoiding me?

08:47.627 --> 08:50.262
(sighing)

08:50.264 --> 08:52.364
Mr. Twain,

08:52.366 --> 08:54.466
given your political leanings,

08:54.468 --> 08:57.536
did you not consider
that your speaking

08:57.538 --> 09:00.171
at the Empire Club could be seen

09:00.173 --> 09:03.308
as a... a provocative act?

09:03.310 --> 09:06.044
Are you saying that whoever
shot at me had the right to?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.113
Of course not.
I must say

09:08.115 --> 09:11.950
I was surprised that the
organization booked me.
As was I.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.120
Seeing you describe
the monarchy as slave owners

09:15.122 --> 09:17.222
who attained wealth
by stealing it.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.224
Close,

09:19.226 --> 09:21.960
but what I actually said was:

09:21.962 --> 09:25.030
"I believe

09:25.032 --> 09:28.433
"I should really see
the end of what is surely

09:28.435 --> 09:31.469
"the grotesquest of all swindles

09:31.471 --> 09:34.639
"ever invented by man,

09:34.641 --> 09:36.575
the monarchy."

09:37.910 --> 09:39.978
You don't agree?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.914
We are ruled by Britain.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.083
Your comments
may be viewed

09:45.085 --> 09:47.953
by some as offensive.
Well,

09:47.955 --> 09:50.455
if it makes you feel
any better,

09:50.457 --> 09:54.759
I don't think of my own
government as different.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.964
I am an anti-Imperialist,
and as such,

09:58.966 --> 10:01.700
I am opposed to having
the eagle put its talons

10:01.702 --> 10:03.935
on any other land.

10:03.937 --> 10:08.039
So you're unpopular
both home and abroad.

10:11.644 --> 10:15.046
You think it's possible someone
followed you here to Toronto?

10:15.048 --> 10:17.449
It's possible.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.117
Given my
points of view,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.186
it's somewhat of a surprise

10:21.188 --> 10:24.289
that someone hasn't
shot at me before.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.259
And to what
do I owe the pleasure?

10:28.261 --> 10:32.030
I've been reviewing your
application for membership.
And?

10:32.032 --> 10:35.200
You are a strong candidate.
Thank you.

10:35.202 --> 10:38.403
I've canceled
Mr. Twain's engagement

10:38.405 --> 10:40.572
at our club.

10:40.574 --> 10:43.141
Considering the circumstances,
that's a wise move.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.477
I would dearly love

10:45.479 --> 10:48.413
to see that man ridden
out of town on a rail.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.650
These self-proclaimed
champions of the people

10:51.652 --> 10:55.220
are nothing but a menace.
Well, I don't exactly
have the authority.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.489
You're a police
Inspector, sir.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.492
What more authority do you need?
A Royal Warrant?

11:00.494 --> 11:03.128
The membership
review committee

11:03.130 --> 11:05.530
meets in a few days.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.399
Good day.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.438
You would think Miss Lawrence
would be interested, you know,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.740
me being a Constable
First Class and all.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.742
You'd think.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.512
I'll admit it is nice
to have a few extra dollars
in the pay packet.

11:25.251 --> 11:29.354
Trumpers and Truefitt, George!

11:29.356 --> 11:32.957
Rose Mouthwash!
The Royal Family uses this.
Henry!

11:37.329 --> 11:39.531
(spritzing)

11:39.533 --> 11:41.433
Nothing.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.569
Excuse me, George?

11:44.571 --> 11:48.273
Forget it. Let's go check out
behind the club, Henry.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.542
And put that back.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.189
Margaret, what
are you doing here?

12:04.191 --> 12:07.425
Oh, I'm just so excited,
Thomas. Have you heard
any news yet?

12:07.427 --> 12:10.929
No.
Oh. But I just saw
Mr. Wilson leave.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.964
Have you been spying
on me, woman?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.633
I just happened to see him
leave as I was arriving.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.769
Oh, I don't mean to pry, Thomas,

12:17.771 --> 12:19.771
I'm just a-twitter
about the possibility.

12:19.773 --> 12:23.608
Margaret Brackenreid, married
to a member of the Empire Club.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.311
That would certainly
shut Verna up.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.313
Why are you so worried
about bloody Verna?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.415
Oh, it's just her
and her gazebo.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.383
If I hear
another word...

12:32.385 --> 12:36.020
I don't know why you insist on
trying to keep up with Verna
bloody Jones. Now come on.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.089
Oh, Thomas.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.095
It is foul back here.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.032
I didn't notice, Henry,
all I can smell is you.

12:48.034 --> 12:51.836
Perhaps you can continue here,
and I'll check the locker
rooms again.

12:51.838 --> 12:55.340
You go ahead
and do that, Henry.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.843
I'll go ahead and
bring in the evidence.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.845
I'll take that.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.059
I was a riverboat captain
for two years,

13:15.061 --> 13:18.429
until the War
of the States broke out.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.900
That's when I took my pen name.
Do tell.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.068
Mark Twain.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.538
Means twelve foot of water,

13:26.540 --> 13:30.642
safe for sail. Seemed
an appropriate moniker

13:30.644 --> 13:34.078
to launch my literary
adventuring.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.881
Yeah.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.584
After that it was Virginia City

13:39.586 --> 13:42.654
and the silver rush.
William went to the Klondike.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.989
The gold rush.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.660
Indeed.
Make any money?
Can't say I did.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.329
Neither did I.
(chuckling)

13:51.331 --> 13:53.698
Unfortunately the story
of my life lately.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.235
That Constable Crabtree says
you're something of a tinkerer.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.237
Oh, he's more
than that.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.407
William is an inventor.
I daresay if he ever left
the police force,

14:02.409 --> 14:04.843
he'd give Mr. Tesla
a run for his money.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.845
Julia, I hardly think that--

14:06.847 --> 14:08.947
Inventions...

14:08.949 --> 14:11.683
I put all my money

14:11.685 --> 14:14.319
into a brand new printing press,

14:14.321 --> 14:17.055
the Paige Compositor.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.791
Left me destitute.

14:19.793 --> 14:22.927
Hence the dog and pony show
I am currently on.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.997
I've got hundreds
of creditors on my back.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.568
Are any of those creditors
from Toronto?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.104
Well, poss...

14:36.141 --> 14:38.142
You don't think...

14:38.144 --> 14:41.546
Two main motives
for murder, Mr. Twain:

14:41.548 --> 14:44.148
love and money.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.194
Anything of interest?

14:56.196 --> 14:59.497
Henry's found the weapon.
It's been recently fired

14:59.499 --> 15:01.900
and it matches the calibre
of the bullets we retrieved.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.902
Is it Fanshaw's?
It is.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.337
But his alibi still holds up.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.440
So anyone
could have used it.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.677
Do you know if Mr. Twain is
planning on leaving town soon?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.847
I... I don't think so.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.949
It would be in his best
interests if he did.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.184
Perhaps you could
persuade him.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.186
May I ask why?

15:22.188 --> 15:24.822
The Empire Club
would like him gone.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.225
They've made that
quite clear to me.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.627
And you would like
to secure your membership.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.330
Hear me out, Murdoch.
Just hear me out.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.666
I give my wife more
grief than good.

15:34.668 --> 15:38.069
She would dearly love
a taste of high society
and I'd like to give her it.

15:40.005 --> 15:42.006
I'll tell Mr. Twain

15:42.008 --> 15:44.042
that our investigation
can proceed

15:44.044 --> 15:47.245
without him.
Thank you, Murdoch.
(clicking tongue)

15:51.283 --> 15:54.519
You two are lucky people.

15:54.521 --> 15:59.123
What makes you say that?
You seem to be in a
relationship of equals.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.660
My wife Livy has been
by my side my entire life.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.897
A true partner.
I've heard of her
by reputation.

16:05.899 --> 16:09.534
She's dying now. Been dying
since my daughter died.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.670
Mr. Twain, I'm so sorry.
And we are broke.

16:12.672 --> 16:16.240
Due in no small part
to reckless ways.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.310
That Empire job
would have paid well.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.312
There must be people
who want to hear you.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.949
Well, I did secure
an engagement in Albany,
but the job pays nothing.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.951
Mr. Twain, I have
a proposition.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.053
I'd like to pay you
for a series of lectures

16:29.055 --> 16:31.289
to the Dominion Woman's
Enfranchisement Association.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.424
I hear you're a supporter.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.561
Yes, I am.

16:36.563 --> 16:41.032
Julia, the last time Mr. Twain
tried to take the podium,
he was shot at.

16:41.034 --> 16:44.268
It's not wise.
So you would rather
he run and hide

16:44.270 --> 16:46.371
than exercise his right
to free speech?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.840
Of course not.
I am merely suggesting

16:48.842 --> 16:52.510
that Toronto may not be the most
hospitable venue for his views.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.545
Then what better place
to express them?

16:54.547 --> 16:58.883
I doubt there's a more useless
endeavour than preaching
to the already converted.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.451
<i>Your wife?</i>

17:00.453 --> 17:04.222
She's hired him for a series
of speaking engagements.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.657
The man is desperate
for money.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.726
So he's staying then?

17:10.662 --> 17:14.332
For the foreseeable
future, yes.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.667
Bollocks.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.342
And that's
all of them?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.844
All I can recall.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.149
These people who
invested in your schemes

17:31.151 --> 17:33.584
did so of their own free will?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.921
I have surprising powers
of persuasion.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.425
Mr. Twain,

17:40.427 --> 17:43.995
do you really need
to speak at this engagement?

17:48.133 --> 17:50.134
My wife is dying.

17:50.136 --> 17:55.139
I have squandered
her fortune and mine.

17:55.141 --> 17:59.143
I need to offer her some comfort

17:59.145 --> 18:01.512
after all she has done for me.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.015
So, yes,

18:04.017 --> 18:08.586
I need to speak
at this engagement.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.492
I'll look into this.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.661
I'll be right back.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.366
Gentlemen. I'd like you to find
out the whereabouts of these men

18:22.368 --> 18:25.470
the night that Mr. Twain
was intended to speak.
Sir.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.605
Thank you.
I'll take Mr. Bertrand,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.308
Mr. Potts, and Mr. Hendrickson.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.945
Let me have a look at that,
George. I am Constable
First Class now.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.682
Right you are, Henry.
I apologize.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.518
I will get

18:40.520 --> 18:42.520
the others.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.189
You can have
Hendrickson.

18:45.191 --> 18:48.559
He lives almost
ten miles out of town.
Oh, I'm aware of that.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.062
Then why would you volunteer?
Because he lives right next

18:51.064 --> 18:53.297
to Mrs. Hampshire's
Finishing School.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.634
Mary Lawrence went there.
Did she?
For a time.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.571
She left, she said the women
there were of easy virtue.
Oh, indeed,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.406
and if I recall correctly,
today is laundry day.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.042
I remember once, Jackson
and I had to reprimand

19:05.044 --> 19:07.712
a couple of them for wandering
around in their unmentionables.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.680
Did you?
Yes.

19:09.682 --> 19:13.417
And they were from France.
The unmentionables.
Parisian undergarments.

19:13.419 --> 19:17.221
Well, allow me
to save you the trip.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.424
(spritzing)

19:20.426 --> 19:23.828
I could use a brisk
bicycle ride.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.933
It's a shame

19:28.935 --> 19:31.602
you don't have a fence
that needs painting.

19:31.604 --> 19:35.273
That was last summer, sir.
Mr. Twain.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.441
Could I have a word?

19:39.778 --> 19:43.347
So this is where you do
the King's bidding?

19:43.349 --> 19:45.349
I simply enforce
the Criminal Code.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.052
I apologize.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.222
I was trying for humour.
I fail as much as I succeed.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.891
You've ruffled
a few feathers.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.195
Beg your pardon?
I said, you've ruffled
a few feathers.

19:57.197 --> 20:00.798
I suppose I have.
And you've put
your own life at risk.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.301
Perhaps it would be for the best
if you were to leave town.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.439
I speak out
against injustice.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.342
No matter what side
of the border.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.744
Imperialism,
British or American,

20:13.746 --> 20:16.314
is a scourge
on this earth.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.382
It is our duty
to civilize these people.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.352
Oof...

20:23.922 --> 20:27.291
Your "White Man's Burden"
is an insult, sir.

20:27.293 --> 20:31.062
What right do we have to impose
our way of life on other people?

20:31.064 --> 20:34.065
America lied to
the Filipino people.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.934
Promised them liberation,
delivered tyranny.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.836
You sound
like a traitor, sir.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.807
No. I simply protest

20:42.809 --> 20:45.443
when the "powers that be"
do something wrong.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.946
I doubt there is anything
traitorous about that.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.449
And you feel
you have the right.
Of course I have the right.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.619
You have the right, I have the
right. We are free men, sir.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.588
You live
in a new country.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.258
One that could chart
its own course.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.094
Why would you
willfully labour

21:03.096 --> 21:05.096
under the yoke
of scoundrels?

21:05.098 --> 21:07.698
My King is a scoundrel?
(chuckling)

21:07.700 --> 21:10.601
All Kings are scoundrels.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.171
Mr. Brackenreid, you seem
like a good man.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.941
You don't deserve
to have a master.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.813
Why am I in here?
Mr. Hendrickson,

21:22.815 --> 21:24.815
the Constable
who spoke with you

21:24.817 --> 21:27.551
said you became agitated
at the mention

21:27.553 --> 21:31.055
of Mark Twain. As such,
I'd like a few words.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.057
If you want to know
my personal feelings

21:33.059 --> 21:35.126
toward Mr. Twain,

21:35.128 --> 21:37.662
I can be most clear.
I hate the man.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.630
Enough to kill?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.466
If I could do it without
consequence, certainly.

21:42.468 --> 21:46.237
The man lied to me,
took every penny I had.

21:46.239 --> 21:49.540
I may have been a fool,
but he was a thief.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.609
Yes. Mr. Twain
convinced you to invest

21:51.611 --> 21:53.744
in the Paige Compositor.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.080
It was going
to change the world.

21:56.082 --> 21:59.050
Revolutionize
the printing process.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.252
It was a sure thing, he said.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.321
The only sure thing
about it was penury.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.559
I have to ask:

22:08.561 --> 22:10.728
do you know what this is?

22:12.664 --> 22:14.532
That's a Webley and Scott.
Military Issue.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.601
But it certainly isn't mine.

22:17.603 --> 22:21.072
It looks
like Fanshaw's.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.741
You knew he kept it
at the club, yes?

22:23.743 --> 22:26.310
He usually pulled it out
when regaling us

22:26.312 --> 22:28.979
with stories of the Battle
of Rorke's Drift.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.549
Zulus to the left of us,
Zulus to the right of us.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.551
That sort of thing.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.120
But I was nowhere
near the Club that night.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.122
The Club?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.024
That's where the shooting was.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.026
How do you know that?

22:42.028 --> 22:43.794
The newspapers.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.797
The shooting was never
reported to the press.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.367
And certainly
wasn't made public.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.236
Club President Wendel Wilson
made sure of that.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.840
Then I must have heard it
from one of the members.

22:59.478 --> 23:03.047
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to stay here,
Mr. Hendrickson.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.559
Mark Twain?
He's supported suffrage
for years.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.729
Oh, so an intelligent man.
Yes.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.731
Will you still be here
to see him?

23:20.733 --> 23:24.068
I don't leave for a week yet.
I envy you.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.371
London is going to be
such an adventure.

23:27.373 --> 23:30.074
Won't it?

23:30.076 --> 23:32.777
I... I just wonder, sometimes,

23:32.779 --> 23:35.212
why I just grasp
at the next new thing.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.082
Shouldn't I have a plan?
You're young.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.084
Plans are for the old.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.921
That's why I've never made any.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.024
Now, Mr. Wilson, have you ever
seen this man before?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.927
Of course. That's Randolf
Hendrickson. A member.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.062
Seriously in arrears.

23:52.064 --> 23:56.167
I see. Was he at the club
the night of the shooting?

23:56.169 --> 23:59.904
I'm not sure. But he was there
earlier in the day.

23:59.906 --> 24:03.007
Clearing out his locker,
I believe.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.678
Thank you.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.680
I'll need you
to sign a statement

24:09.682 --> 24:12.550
confirming what
you've just told me.
Of course.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.686
Murdoch, we have a problem.
What is it, sir?

24:15.688 --> 24:18.222
There's been a shooting
at Mr. Twain's hotel room.

24:31.169 --> 24:33.537
I opened the door.
The man started firing.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.973
Can you describe him?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.676
I didn't have my glasses,
it all happened so quickly.

24:38.678 --> 24:41.712
And I was going to give chase,
but I saw young Benson
on the floor.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.514
Did you see anything?

24:43.516 --> 24:45.516
All I saw was the gun.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.185
Are you all right?

24:48.187 --> 24:51.088
I stumbled when I tried
to get out of the way.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.960
Both Mr. Hendrickson
and Mr. Wilson were with me

24:55.962 --> 24:58.829
at the moment
the shots were fired.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.732
Despite Wilson's objections,
somebody could have been acting
on their behalf.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.734
Bugalugs does
have a point.

25:03.736 --> 25:07.338
And besides, Hendrickson did lie
about being at the club.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.608
What about Fanshaw?
I checked his alibi.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.544
It still holds up.

25:13.546 --> 25:16.280
George, have you
questioned Mr. Potts?

25:16.282 --> 25:18.449
No, sir.
Please do.

25:18.451 --> 25:20.885
And also question any
remaining folks who may have

25:20.887 --> 25:23.587
invested in schemes
at Mr. Twain's behest.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.890
Sir, shouldn't we still be
looking into the Club?

25:25.892 --> 25:28.092
I mean, it seems
the most likely place.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.962
No, I intend to. Henry, I'd
like you to apply for membership

25:31.964 --> 25:35.699
at the Empire Club.
Sir!
George,

25:35.701 --> 25:37.268
Henry's worked hard
on this case.

25:37.270 --> 25:41.038
He brought in Mr. Hendrickson.
He found the gun.
Besides,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.741
have you taken a whiff
of him lately?
(sniffing)

25:43.743 --> 25:47.044
He smells like a bloody toff.
(chuckling)

25:49.414 --> 25:52.550
Henry James of James,
James, Jarvis and James.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.552
Ahh. And your uncle

25:54.554 --> 25:56.554
is a member of the Royal
Victorian Order?

25:56.556 --> 26:00.124
Indeed. Uncle Clive served
Her Majesty until her death.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.362
And you're recently emigrated?
Scant months ago, yes.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.599
Homesick?
Oh, I shall adjust,

26:08.601 --> 26:10.801
but I do sometimes think
that the only soil

26:10.803 --> 26:13.337
worth standing on
is British soil.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.139
I concur.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.741
But you'll soon see this place
as British soil.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.511
It does seem a most
genteel environment.

26:20.513 --> 26:23.013
Take a look around,
ask some questions.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.916
I believe some of our younger
members may be around today.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.652
Thank you, sir.

26:32.791 --> 26:36.727
(laughter)

26:39.864 --> 26:43.133
It's a grand country, really.
Once you get used to
the bloody winters.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.804
And the colonials.
That takes some doing.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.340
I hear you had a rather
infamous one of them
in here recently.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.342
A Mr. Twain.

26:51.344 --> 26:53.811
That was Clarence
Eldridge's doing.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.813
The old man's dotty.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.482
Didn't even know who he was.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.018
But Mr. Wilson had that
scoundrel out the door

27:01.020 --> 27:03.554
with hardly a fare thee well.
And lucky for him.

27:03.556 --> 27:06.857
I would have loved to introduce
him to a proper pair of dukes.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.293
(laughing)

27:11.229 --> 27:14.398
Yes. I heard
through the grapevine

27:14.400 --> 27:16.900
that shots may have been fired.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.370
No one was hurt.

27:19.372 --> 27:23.641
Still, I imagine it would have
made for a riotous evening.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.644
You've heard Mr. Twain
is speaking this evening.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.879
Here?
Here?

27:28.881 --> 27:32.716
A speech about allowing women
the right to vote?

27:32.718 --> 27:35.552
Mr. Wilson says
that speech will occur

27:35.554 --> 27:38.355
over his dead body.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.358
His or Mr. Twain's.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.295
(laughing)

27:47.232 --> 27:51.101
Really, they seem nothing more
than a bunch of blowhards with
an appetite for port, sir.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.571
Although I did hear that some
members of the Empire Club

27:54.573 --> 27:57.107
plan to disrupt
Mr. Twain's speech.
Oh?

27:57.109 --> 28:00.577
So, sir, I thought
maybe I should go back,

28:00.579 --> 28:03.547
investigate further,
as it were.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.417
Get back
in uniform, Henry.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.919
Sir.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.689
I could
get used to this.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.691
Good for you, Henry.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.693
Miss Lawrence
is excited about the news

28:15.695 --> 28:18.495
that I am soon to be a member
of the Empire Club.
Is that right?

28:18.497 --> 28:22.232
I assume her mother's health has
taken a turn for the better.
It has indeed.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.436
Did you question the rest
of the investors

28:25.438 --> 28:27.771
as the Detective asked?
Yes, I did.

28:27.773 --> 28:30.207
In fact, here are my notes.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.309
Why don't you take credit
for those as well?

28:34.379 --> 28:37.948
Whatever
do you mean, George?

29:01.439 --> 29:03.607
I would rather
this didn't proceed.

29:03.609 --> 29:06.910
William, you sound like a
phonograph that's become stuck.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.580
Julia,

29:09.582 --> 29:12.116
I don't want you on the stage
with him.
William,

29:12.118 --> 29:15.119
I'm going to be on stage.
Doctor Ogden,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.121
I agree with the Detective.
Keep in mind,

29:17.123 --> 29:19.757
whoever's gunning for Mr. Twain
does not seem to be
a very good shot.

29:19.759 --> 29:23.527
Thank you
very much, George.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.797
You realize the Empire Club
has half of the city up in arms.
What a surprise.

29:26.799 --> 29:31.101
Any time anyone in Toronto
suggests anything progressive,
half the city is up in arms!

29:34.839 --> 29:38.575
I'm just not sure it is
necessary to have a <i>man</i>
<i>advocating for our cause.</i>

29:38.577 --> 29:41.612
You are a sour one.
I am not.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.248
I just believe we women
are more than capable
of stating our own case.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.451
We can state it all we want,
but it makes no matter
if no one is listening.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.154
I suppose so...
Did you just agree with me?

29:50.156 --> 29:52.956
I suppose I did.
We <i>are</i> making progress.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.526
What is happening here?
Excuse me.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.130
Let us pass.
Go home.
No,

30:00.132 --> 30:03.801
we shall not. Now let us pass.
There will be no lecture
tonight, I'm afraid.

30:03.803 --> 30:06.036
Move out of our way, sir.
Or I shall be forced to--

30:06.038 --> 30:08.138
Hit me with your handbag?
(men chuckling)

30:08.140 --> 30:10.641
Give it your best.
Stand aside, Mr. Wilson.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.476
Look at this rabble.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.711
Send them home.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.247
Did you not
hear me?

30:17.249 --> 30:19.817
Send them home and
call off this lecture.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.819
Move out of our way.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.721
Oi, watch it!
Do I need remind you
what's at stake here?

30:24.723 --> 30:27.991
No, you don't. Now please
clear out of the way,
Mr. Wilson.

30:27.993 --> 30:31.662
If you and your friends
want to attend the event, buy
a ticket like the rest of them.

30:31.664 --> 30:35.365
If not, stop being a nuisance.
You're not calling off
this lecture?

30:35.367 --> 30:38.101
You got wax
in your ears? Move along,

30:38.103 --> 30:41.839
otherwise you'll be spending
a night in my cells.
You, sir,

30:41.841 --> 30:44.374
have just made yourself
a very dangerous enemy.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.377
Oh, I've made worse.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.713
I hope you realize

30:49.715 --> 30:52.683
I am formally rescinding
my sponsorship.

30:52.685 --> 30:56.453
Oh, move along, Eldridge,
you old codger!
(women laughing)

30:56.455 --> 30:58.455
Ladies...

30:58.457 --> 31:01.158
Inspector.
Thank you.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.431
Wow...

31:09.267 --> 31:11.702
Mr. Twain,

31:11.704 --> 31:15.172
perhaps this wasn't a good idea.
Perhaps I should tell them
that you've taken ill.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.307
I can't do that.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.109
Look at that crowd.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.311
William has often accused me
of being impulsive.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.147
Perhaps he's right.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.049
Are you ready, Mr. Twain?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.585
I certainly am.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.555
(applause)

31:31.557 --> 31:34.458
Keep your eyes
open, George.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.761
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honour

31:37.763 --> 31:41.598
to introduce to you one of
America's finest men of letters.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.634
The author of
<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,</i>

31:43.636 --> 31:45.869
The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn,

31:45.871 --> 31:49.139
and countless essays,
both literary and scholarly.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.807
Please welcome

31:50.809 --> 31:54.177
Mr. Mark Twain.
(applause)

31:56.414 --> 32:00.117
Thank you, ladies.
And gentlemen.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.586
Your welcome

32:02.588 --> 32:04.755
is a lot warmer than the one
I received earlier.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.324
(laughter)
And a lot less dangerous.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.395
You know, when
you have lived as long

32:11.397 --> 32:13.664
as I have,

32:13.666 --> 32:15.866
you have the right
to change your mind.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.669
And that's what I'm going
to do here tonight.

32:18.671 --> 32:21.538
I'm gonna change the minds
of those of you

32:21.540 --> 32:25.575
who believe that women should
not have the right to vote.

32:28.313 --> 32:31.848
Let me read you something.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.421
"I never want to see

32:37.423 --> 32:39.723
"the women voting, and gabbling

32:39.725 --> 32:41.992
"about politics,
and electioneering.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.561
"There is something revolting

32:44.563 --> 32:47.297
"in the thought.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.299
"Let your natural bosses

32:49.301 --> 32:51.635
do the voting."

32:51.637 --> 32:55.172
(murmurs)
Those were my words.

32:55.174 --> 32:58.175
That's what I believed,

32:58.177 --> 33:00.811
until I met my wife,
Olivia Langdon.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.349
After that meeting,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.985
I came to believe that a woman

33:07.987 --> 33:10.087
is always right.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.155
(laughter and applause)

33:12.157 --> 33:14.858
And I became
a woman's rights man!

33:14.860 --> 33:17.794
You know, if women held
the right to vote,

33:17.796 --> 33:21.331
the world would not be
in the state

33:21.333 --> 33:23.633
it's in.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.336
(applause)

33:26.338 --> 33:29.406
I am prepared to speak

33:29.408 --> 33:32.843
until I have convinced
every single one of you.

33:32.845 --> 33:36.446
Mr. Benson, would you?
My mother--

33:36.448 --> 33:39.016
(gunshot)
(screaming)
George. Upstairs!

33:39.018 --> 33:41.084
Bloody Hell.

33:53.731 --> 33:56.366
I'll get him to the morgue,
Julia. Let the Detective know

33:56.368 --> 33:59.136
my report will be on his desk.
Thank you, Emily.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.407
Are you all right, Mr. Twain?

34:03.409 --> 34:06.910
The fault is all mine.
No, the blame can be shared

34:06.912 --> 34:09.079
equally. I should never
have suggested this.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.182
If they hadn't attempted it
here, they would have attempted
it somewhere else.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.217
We'll find out who
did this, Mr. Twain.

34:14.219 --> 34:18.455
Some of the members from the
Empire Club were outside the
building. One of those buggers

34:18.457 --> 34:20.457
will be responsible for this.
Sir.

34:20.459 --> 34:23.260
Shall I escort Mr. Twain
back to his hotel?

34:23.262 --> 34:26.596
Yes, please, George.
And stand guard for the night.
Be vigilant.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.965
Sir. Mr. Twain.

34:42.113 --> 34:45.982
The fatal shot
came from up here.
It was an easy shot.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.985
Would've been like
shooting fish in a barrel.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.855
He should have
succeeded this time.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.925
Yes. He should have.

35:02.333 --> 35:05.302
<i>I am prepared...</i>

35:05.304 --> 35:08.772
to convince every
single one of you.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.341
(Brackenreid): He should
never have missed.

35:13.511 --> 35:18.115
(screaming)

35:18.117 --> 35:21.017
Sir.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.621
What if Mr. Twain was never
the intended target?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.823
The young lad. Benson.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.959
He appears to be the only one
unfortunate enough

35:28.961 --> 35:32.129
to have been struck
by a bullet.

35:32.131 --> 35:35.932
Mr. Twain, why was
Mr. Benson in your employ?

35:35.934 --> 35:37.934
How do you mean?

35:37.936 --> 35:40.871
Well, he was an employee
at the Empire Club.

35:40.873 --> 35:44.174
He left that position
to work with me.

35:44.176 --> 35:47.577
Forgive me for asking, but
you mentioned you were broke.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.579
How could you afford
to pay him?

35:49.581 --> 35:52.582
He agreed to work
on commission.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.684
He would find me
speaking engagements

35:54.686 --> 35:57.921
and take a percentage.
Why would he leave a job

35:57.923 --> 36:00.891
at one of the finest clubs
in the city and give up
a regular paycheque?

36:00.893 --> 36:03.527
He would have made
more with me.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.563
He had already found me
several engagements.

36:06.565 --> 36:10.333
We were to go
to St. Louis

36:10.335 --> 36:12.903
after the speech tonight.

36:12.905 --> 36:16.139
That boy was
a smooth operator.

36:16.141 --> 36:18.542
You had conversations
with him.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.077
Did he have any enemies?

36:21.079 --> 36:24.714
The only thing he ever said
to me was that his time

36:24.716 --> 36:27.851
with the Empire Club
was short-lived.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.254
That it was time for him
to move on.
Why?

36:31.256 --> 36:33.623
I don't know.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.126
I'm sorry.

36:36.128 --> 36:39.429
Perhaps another visit to
the Empire Club is in order.

36:39.431 --> 36:43.767
Then maybe we should send in
our own smooth operator.

36:43.769 --> 36:47.204
You'll need to find out
everything you can

36:47.206 --> 36:49.806
about Mr. Benson.
Yes, sir.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.143
Um, what would you like
to know exactly?

36:53.145 --> 36:55.612
How about if anyone there
would have been inclined

36:55.614 --> 36:58.114
to murder him.
Oh, of course, sir.

36:58.116 --> 37:01.218
Um, I was wondering
if I shouldn't bring

37:01.220 --> 37:05.755
a female companion? It could
provide an excellent cover--
It's a men's club!

37:05.757 --> 37:07.824
Quite right.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.736
Damn shame.
That it is.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.305
But life goes on.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.341
For some of us at least.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.743
Barkeep.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.745
Yes. What can I get for you?

37:28.747 --> 37:32.315
And you are?
Samuel. Samuel Langhorne.

37:32.317 --> 37:35.418
I'm the new man.
Good to meet you, Samuel.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.622
Could you
prepare me a gimlet?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.991
A gimlet. Yes, of course.

37:40.993 --> 37:45.028
Let's see if he prepares one
as well as Bens.

37:45.030 --> 37:48.498
A gimlet, um...
Well, obviously he can't.

37:48.500 --> 37:53.436
Do you prefer fresh limes,
sir, or cordial?
(laughing)

37:53.438 --> 37:56.139
Fresh, of course.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.476
Very good. You were
having us on.

38:01.979 --> 38:03.980
To Benson.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.783
He was a good one.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.885
You are speaking of the man
I'm replacing, I assume?

38:08.887 --> 38:11.021
We are indeed.

38:11.023 --> 38:13.823
But no one will ever
replace Benson.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.026
Gentlemen, I assure you,

38:16.028 --> 38:18.028
I've tended bar
in some of the...

38:18.030 --> 38:20.297
finest establishments
in all the land.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.799
I'm sure you mix a fine drink,

38:22.801 --> 38:25.402
but Benson could do
so much more.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.538
You could always count on him.
For a favour.

38:28.540 --> 38:32.208
An alibi.
A spot of female comfort.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.844
When he himself wasn't
comforting females.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.413
(laughing)

38:36.415 --> 38:39.149
Very good.
I'm sometimes surprised

38:39.151 --> 38:43.053
he lasted here as long here
as he did, considering
some of his escapades.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.989
Escapades?
Hello, fellows.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.757
Ah, James. Come over here.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.960
We're having a bit of a wake
for our dear departed.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.230
(grunting)
Sir, please allow me...
Thank you.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.403
Anything I can get
for you, sir?
Scotch and water.

39:00.405 --> 39:03.206
Any brand you prefer?
Scottish.

39:04.542 --> 39:08.511
(scoffing)
These escapades
you were speaking of...

39:08.513 --> 39:12.615
Well, far be it from me
to gossip, but...

39:12.617 --> 39:14.684
Good work, George.
Thank you, sir.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.820
Even if you weren't
authorized to do so.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.956
Sir, I felt I needed to remind
you that I'm capable of
dealing with anything

39:19.958 --> 39:22.125
that's thrown at me.
Despite my rank.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.195
George, you're Constable
Third Class in name only.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.231
We all know that.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.233
Why did you book
Mr. Twain?

39:30.235 --> 39:32.736
He's a renowned humourist.
A world traveler.

39:32.738 --> 39:36.106
And an enemy of
the British Empire.
I didn't know that.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.341
Mr. Eldridge,

39:38.343 --> 39:40.977
you may enjoy acting the fool,
but don't play me for one.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.146
You knew all about
Mr. Twain's reputation,

39:43.148 --> 39:45.382
and you knew it would
cause a stir.
Thomas,

39:45.384 --> 39:48.618
I realize you must be upset,
but I had no choice

39:48.620 --> 39:51.287
but to withdraw
my offer of sponsorship.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.891
I don't give two monkeys
about your sponsorship.
I believe that you knew

39:54.893 --> 39:57.527
Mr. Twain's visit would cause
a great deal of commotion.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.263
And in a commotion,
many things can happen.

40:00.265 --> 40:03.867
And indeed they did. But
I would never have suspected

40:03.869 --> 40:06.136
that a member
of our club would--
I recall you telling me

40:06.138 --> 40:08.738
you shot that gnu.
I did.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.907
Two hundred yards
if it was an inch.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.677
Indeed.
A pistol's a different
proposition altogether though,

40:14.679 --> 40:17.113
isn't it?
I would imagine.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.082
I think you now
know that for a fact.

40:19.084 --> 40:22.652
Why did you assign Mr. Benson
to be Mr. Twain's minder?

40:22.654 --> 40:24.654
He was an able young fellow.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.424
An excellent concierge
at the club,

40:27.426 --> 40:29.426
as well as a fine bartender.

40:29.428 --> 40:32.128
I knew he'd be able to make
Mr. Twain's stay comfortable.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.631
He was known to make a lot
of people comfortable,

40:34.633 --> 40:38.268
isn't that true?
Yes. It's a shame to lose him.
Is it?

40:38.270 --> 40:40.270
How's Clarissa taking it?

40:40.272 --> 40:42.272
Excuse me?

40:42.274 --> 40:45.008
Your wife, Clarissa.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.876
Almost thirty years your junior.

40:46.878 --> 40:50.113
How is she feeling
about Mr. Benson's death?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.515
Why are you bringing
my wife into this?

40:52.517 --> 40:54.384
Because she's at the center
of it, isn't she?

40:54.386 --> 40:56.386
She is not.

40:56.388 --> 40:58.855
Your wife had been seeing
young Benson for some time.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.124
I imagine you might have been
able to handle it,

41:01.126 --> 41:04.727
but when the rest of the club
found out, they looked on you
as a laughing stock.

41:04.729 --> 41:08.832
The wife of a member of
the Empire Club sleeping
with a lowly bartender

41:08.834 --> 41:10.400
and not caring who knew.

41:10.402 --> 41:13.470
You don't know that.
Men talk to bartenders.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.005
Even more than they do
their priests.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.576
We know exactly what your wife
was doing with Mr. Benson.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.311
And you knew it too, didn't you?

41:21.313 --> 41:24.214
I told her to stop.
But she wouldn't,

41:24.216 --> 41:26.583
so you killed Benson instead!

41:28.552 --> 41:32.388
Mr. Twain was nothing more
than a diversion.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.326
Look on the bright side,
Clarence.

41:36.328 --> 41:38.661
She won't be sleeping
with him anymore.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.971
really said that
to Mr. Wilson?

41:47.973 --> 41:50.006
Indeed I did.
Thomas...

41:50.008 --> 41:53.209
Now, Margaret, I know
that you're probably upset--
You did the right thing.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.211
Your honour is far more
important

41:55.213 --> 41:57.213
than associating
with a bunch of windbags.

41:57.215 --> 42:00.416
So you're satisfied with
the odd policeman's ball?

42:00.418 --> 42:02.418
More than satisfied.

42:02.420 --> 42:06.222
Besides, you'd have probably
been kicked out of there
within two weeks anyway.

42:06.224 --> 42:09.292
What about
Verna Jones's gazebo?

42:09.294 --> 42:11.294
Didn't you hear?

42:11.296 --> 42:13.663
It burnt down
in a mysterious fire.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.571
I will give Nikola your best
the next time I see him.

42:21.573 --> 42:25.041
Please do.
And Doctor Ogden,

42:25.043 --> 42:27.477
I do hope you'll be successful.
We will be,

42:27.479 --> 42:30.413
one day.
And Inspector,

42:30.415 --> 42:32.515
I owe you an apology.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.551
An autograph will suffice,
Mr. Twain.

42:34.553 --> 42:37.420
They rejected me.

42:37.422 --> 42:41.124
The Empire Club?
Apparently my thievery
was noted.

42:41.126 --> 42:44.827
You didn't say anything,
did you, George?
Of course not.

42:44.829 --> 42:47.864
And Henry, all they would've had
to do was take a whiff of you.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.633
Constable Crabtree,

42:50.635 --> 42:53.503
you strike me as a man
with a nimble mind.

42:53.505 --> 42:55.905
Thank you, sir.
And this work of yours

42:55.907 --> 42:58.741
shows some promise.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.110
You read it?
I started it.

43:01.112 --> 43:03.179
Got any more in you?

43:03.181 --> 43:07.750
I don't know. I haven't much
felt like writing lately.
Oh...

43:07.752 --> 43:10.453
You spent some time
in penitentiary.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.689
Lost a fiancÃ©e.

43:12.691 --> 43:15.425
Indeed.
Take it from me, son.

43:15.427 --> 43:18.061
Reality can be beaten

43:18.063 --> 43:20.163
with enough imagination.

43:22.499 --> 43:24.033
Go to it.

43:24.035 --> 43:26.603
Thank you, Mr. Twain.
