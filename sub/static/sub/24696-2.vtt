<i>In New York City's war on crime</i>

00:02.668 --> 00:04.818
<i>the worst criminal
offenders are pursued</i>

00:04.819 --> 00:07.586
<i>by the detectives of
the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:07.587 --> 00:09.772
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.780 --> 00:14.814
- All right, Theresa.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.917
Your turn.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.552
- Tell everybody to duck.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.960
- Wow. Nicely done.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.262
- Thanks.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.198
- The priest sent
me an apology note.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.101
As though I'm supposed
to absolve him.

00:35.102 --> 00:38.404
For years I carried the
shame of that abuse

00:38.405 --> 00:40.506
without telling a soul.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.174
And I can't do it anymore.

00:42.175 --> 00:46.378
It's-it's time to come clean.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.581
- Guess what I found out today.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

00:58.492 --> 01:01.026
Oh. Hello.

01:25.051 --> 01:27.620
- But I say to you,
love your enemies,

01:27.621 --> 01:30.956
and pray for those
who persecute you,

01:30.957 --> 01:34.727
that you may be children
of your heavenly father,

01:34.728 --> 01:38.597
for he makes the sun rise
on the bad and the good.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.368
And causes rain to
fall on the just

01:42.369 --> 01:45.004
and the unjust.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.773
- All right, talk about
the blind date from hell.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.010
First he takes me to a blood
bank to donate plasma,

01:51.011 --> 01:54.113
then Tequila shots.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.550
What?

01:58.585 --> 02:00.853
Theresa, why?

02:00.854 --> 02:03.022
- Monsignor, at
your convenience,

02:03.023 --> 02:04.056
I'd love the chance to talk.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.224
- Oh, it's taken care of.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.993
- Excuse me?

02:07.994 --> 02:11.263
- John, relax.
It's all taken care of.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.604
- I'm not supposed
to let you in.

02:18.605 --> 02:23.275
- I know.
I really appreciate it.

02:23.276 --> 02:26.579
Theresa?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.614
Theresa?

02:30.617 --> 02:34.587
You awake?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.589
I'm coming in.

02:49.590 --> 02:52.290
<b>Adriano_CSI www.addic7ed.com</b>

03:31.925 --> 03:33.258
Name's Theresa Esperna.

03:33.259 --> 03:34.927
None of the neighbors
hears the shot.

03:34.928 --> 03:36.895
No security cameras
in the building.

03:36.896 --> 03:39.998
We found this tucked in the
folder of her iPad case.

03:39.999 --> 03:41.366
It's why we called.

03:41.367 --> 03:44.102
- Wire transfer
from bank salerno

03:44.103 --> 03:45.704
to a numbered offshore account.

03:45.705 --> 03:48.307
2.7 million dollars.

03:48.308 --> 03:51.710
- Uh, who...

03:55.381 --> 03:56.748
Who moved the body?

03:56.749 --> 03:59.384
- Nobody.

03:59.385 --> 04:01.687
Her friend and the building
super found her like this.

04:01.688 --> 04:03.422
There's no forced entry.

04:03.423 --> 04:04.423
It looks self-inflicted.

04:04.424 --> 04:06.458
- Thanks, detective.

04:08.828 --> 04:10.596
- Well, we have an entry wound.

04:10.597 --> 04:12.264
Below the right ear,

04:12.265 --> 04:15.934
right under the hairline.

04:15.935 --> 04:17.736
But the gun is over there.

04:24.010 --> 04:27.112
Gun powder.

04:27.113 --> 04:30.415
There's flakes under
her fingernails.

04:30.416 --> 04:31.950
Both hands.
- Soap?

04:31.951 --> 04:34.353
- Maybe.

04:34.354 --> 04:36.622
Has a sweet smell, but
not a common fragrance.

04:36.623 --> 04:39.291
It-it's unusual,
like, uh, balsam.

04:39.292 --> 04:42.561
- Some kind of botanical?

04:42.562 --> 04:45.998
- I'm not sure.
Can we bag both her hands?

04:45.999 --> 04:48.367
- You're not thinking suicide.

04:48.368 --> 04:49.468
- You are?

04:49.469 --> 04:54.439
- The gun could have
bounced when she fell.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.074
Suicide that looks
like a murder?

04:56.075 --> 04:58.176
- Or a murder that
looks like a suicide.

05:12.925 --> 05:14.660
- We were supposed to
meet for breakfast.

05:14.661 --> 05:16.662
She said she needed my advice.

05:16.663 --> 05:17.663
- About what?

05:17.664 --> 05:20.532
- Uh, probably a man.

05:20.533 --> 05:24.536
When she didn't answer
her cell, I came by.

05:24.537 --> 05:26.905
Why would someone kill Theresa?

05:26.906 --> 05:29.307
- What makes you
think it was murder?

05:29.308 --> 05:30.642
- Because suicide's
a mortal sin,

05:30.643 --> 05:33.679
and your friend was
old school catholic.

05:33.680 --> 05:37.349
She has a crucifix in her room,

05:37.350 --> 05:38.850
catholic dating
service on her iPad.

05:38.851 --> 05:41.553
- Um, Tess was raised in
a super strict family.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.061
- Notice there's not much
paper in this apartment.

05:49.062 --> 05:50.529
She-she was a techie?

05:50.530 --> 05:53.532
- Yeah, on her iPad 24-7, 365.

05:53.533 --> 05:54.966
- We did find one
scrap of paper.

05:54.967 --> 05:57.069
A wire transfer
from bank salerno?

05:57.070 --> 05:59.137
- That's where she worked.

06:01.874 --> 06:04.443
- It's horrifying.
Theresa was a Saint.

06:04.444 --> 06:07.045
- What time did she leave
your office last night?

06:07.046 --> 06:08.213
- Just after 6:00.

06:08.214 --> 06:09.314
Said she had a business meeting.

06:09.315 --> 06:10.582
Didn't say with whom.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.884
- You know, I notice
the papal crest

06:12.885 --> 06:14.486
just after the alcove there.

06:14.487 --> 06:17.656
That's a obvious
display of faith.

06:17.657 --> 06:20.926
Aren't you afraid that
might alienate clients?

06:20.927 --> 06:26.198
Unless, of course, the client
is the catholic church?

06:26.199 --> 06:28.734
- We'll know for sure once
we subpoena your records.

06:28.735 --> 06:31.570
This isn't Switzerland.

06:31.571 --> 06:33.672
- Theresa was senior v.P.

06:33.673 --> 06:35.507
In charge of the victims
settlement account

06:35.508 --> 06:37.876
established by the
archdiocese of New York.

06:37.877 --> 06:40.612
- Victims of abuse by priests.

06:40.613 --> 06:43.949
- Yes.

06:43.950 --> 06:48.820
- Now, aren't there any
better jobs in this bank

06:48.821 --> 06:56.962
for a woman of, you
know, her skills?

06:56.963 --> 07:00.065
- Theresa felt very strongly
about remunerating victims.

07:00.066 --> 07:01.600
She wanted to make amends

07:01.601 --> 07:03.568
and restore the good
name of the church.

07:03.569 --> 07:07.172
- So the wire transfer was a
settlement to bn individual?

07:07.173 --> 07:09.040
- Yes.

07:09.041 --> 07:12.010
- She have any help
with that account?

07:12.011 --> 07:13.445
- I helped Theresa

07:13.446 --> 07:15.180
manage the settlement
money in the accounts.

07:15.181 --> 07:17.883
Kept it in t-bills,
risk-free bonds.

07:17.884 --> 07:19.651
- So you were close?

07:19.652 --> 07:21.620
- She was one of
my best friends.

07:21.621 --> 07:24.456
- We found a
disbursement receipt

07:24.457 --> 07:26.625
for $2.7 million.

07:26.626 --> 07:31.062
- Um, that was for Alice
garvey in mount Vernon.

07:31.063 --> 07:33.031
- That's a pretty big payout.

07:33.032 --> 07:36.835
- She was molested dozens
of times over five years.

07:36.836 --> 07:39.638
- This is a mediation
DVD, right?

07:39.639 --> 07:42.340
I mean, that's what
these are, aren't they?

07:42.341 --> 07:45.777
The victim tells their story
in front of a camera,

07:45.778 --> 07:49.080
and then a professional
mediator and Theresa,

07:49.081 --> 07:51.917
they determine the
settlement amounts?

07:51.918 --> 07:54.052
- Can't be easy
watching those stories.

07:54.053 --> 07:56.154
- Yeah, we watched every
single one of 'em together.

07:56.155 --> 07:58.356
They're tough to take.

07:58.357 --> 08:00.492
- College all-star.

08:00.493 --> 08:03.228
- I had a tryout
with the Phillies.

08:03.229 --> 08:04.763
They told me I'd
make a great banker.

08:04.764 --> 08:06.231
- Wow.

08:06.232 --> 08:09.201
Hey, you got little league
and you got college,

08:09.202 --> 08:10.368
but there's no high school.

08:10.369 --> 08:11.970
- Yeah, those were
my awkward years.

08:11.971 --> 08:14.139
I guess I'm ashamed.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.774
- Right.

08:15.775 --> 08:17.642
That's a catholic word.

08:17.643 --> 08:19.644
You know, "ashamed."

08:19.645 --> 08:21.246
- Speaking of which,

08:21.247 --> 08:25.617
we found a catholic dating
service on Theresa's iPad.

08:25.618 --> 08:27.686
- Catholic crush.

08:27.687 --> 08:30.789
The ad said that they would
find her God's perfect match.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.090
- Did they?

08:32.091 --> 08:36.394
- Nobody on that site could
measure up to Theresa.

08:36.395 --> 08:39.331
And God wasn't availle.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.715
- Chief of the detectives office

08:56.716 --> 08:59.985
just called about
those psych evals.

08:59.986 --> 09:03.288
You know, those shrink
sessions are non-cancelable.

09:03.289 --> 09:04.990
- Yeah, you got it, captain.

09:04.991 --> 09:07.359
- Spare me the
attitude, all right?

09:11.430 --> 09:13.231
- You know that it's a waste...

09:13.232 --> 09:15.400
- I know how non-negotiable
these sessions were

09:15.401 --> 09:17.669
to get your ass back
behind this desk.

09:17.670 --> 09:19.838
They still think
you're crazy upstairs.

09:19.839 --> 09:23.909
You know this.

09:23.910 --> 09:25.944
- Okay, thanks.

09:25.945 --> 09:27.846
I spoke to her father in Mexico.

09:27.847 --> 09:29.848
She came when she was
18 to go to college,

09:29.849 --> 09:32.417
went to Georgetown,
got a Harvard mba.

09:32.418 --> 09:35.186
Senior v.P.
On wall street at 28.

09:35.187 --> 09:38.023
- Immigrant success story.

09:38.024 --> 09:40.859
Devout catholic.

09:40.860 --> 09:44.162
She runs a fund to help victims.

09:44.163 --> 09:47.132
She's lonely. No boyfriend.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.167
- "God's perfect
match in 60 days

09:49.168 --> 09:50.635
or your money back"?

09:50.636 --> 09:53.772
- Wonder if I'm too old
for Catechism class.

09:53.773 --> 09:57.075
- Lab's analyzing the soap
flakes under her fingernails.

09:57.076 --> 09:59.277
This is from ballistics.

09:59.278 --> 10:02.080
- We got a hit on the.22
beretta.

10:04.717 --> 10:07.419
- All right, so anyone tell me
what an elephant sounds like?

10:08.554 --> 10:10.455
Right! Very good.

10:10.456 --> 10:11.823
All right, what do
we got down here?

10:11.824 --> 10:13.325
- Lizards.
- Lizard.

10:13.326 --> 10:14.693
- Monsignor?
- Monkey.

10:14.694 --> 10:15.994
- Hi.

10:15.995 --> 10:17.829
- Can we have a moment please?

10:17.830 --> 10:20.031
- Yep, that's my gun.

10:20.032 --> 10:21.199
I took her to the gun range

10:21.200 --> 10:23.835
to show her how to fire it.

10:23.836 --> 10:25.403
And I gave it to her
for protection.

10:25.404 --> 10:27.305
- Protection from who?

10:27.306 --> 10:28.773
- Well, a couple of months ago

10:28.774 --> 10:30.942
there was this out-of-state
abuse victim, and...

10:30.943 --> 10:32.377
His parish declared bankruptcy,

10:32.378 --> 10:33.945
so he made threats.

10:33.946 --> 10:35.613
Luckily, nothing happened.

10:35.614 --> 10:39.184
- So it's safe to say you're not
big on "turn the other cheek"?

10:39.185 --> 10:42.320
- I realize giving
her the gun was a...

10:42.321 --> 10:45.156
Terrible mistake.

10:45.157 --> 10:49.094
- We're curious about your
relationship with her.

10:49.095 --> 10:52.530
- Cordial. Not personal.

10:52.531 --> 10:55.767
I oversee settlements on
behalf of the archdiocese.

10:55.768 --> 10:58.203
- You mean like the
one to Alice garvey.

10:58.204 --> 11:01.639
- Yes. But, as you know,

11:01.640 --> 11:03.908
I'm not at liberty
to speak about that.

11:03.909 --> 11:06.678
Confidentiality
agreements and all.

11:06.679 --> 11:08.513
- Monsignor, we're ready.

11:08.514 --> 11:11.116
- Okay, I'm coming.

11:11.117 --> 11:12.817
Look, I've got a whole
ward full of kids

11:12.818 --> 11:15.286
that need my help today,
so if you don't mind...

11:15.287 --> 11:18.289
- Sure.

11:18.290 --> 11:21.659
- The wound's consistent
with female gunshot suicides

11:21.660 --> 11:23.194
in one respect...

11:23.195 --> 11:25.363
behind the ear, below hairline.

11:25.364 --> 11:27.632
- She wanted an
open-casket funeral.

11:27.633 --> 11:30.402
- No note, no
motive for suicide.

11:30.403 --> 11:33.138
- Only one in six leave a note.
You know that.

11:33.139 --> 11:34.706
- Uh, we found two varieties

11:34.707 --> 11:37.175
of soap flakes under
her fingernails.

11:37.176 --> 11:39.010
Her skin's very exfoliated.

11:39.011 --> 11:42.881
Heavy scrubbing on
the inner thighs.

11:42.882 --> 11:45.984
- Looks like she
used a pumice stone.

11:45.985 --> 11:48.286
- There's no pumice
stone in her shower.

11:48.287 --> 11:52.123
But her washcloth was wet.

11:52.124 --> 11:55.560
- She showered at home,
and also somewhere else.

11:57.463 --> 11:59.264
She felt unclean.

11:59.265 --> 12:01.166
You do a rape kit?

12:01.167 --> 12:02.667
- Yeah.

12:02.668 --> 12:03.835
She did have sex the
night of the murder,

12:03.836 --> 12:07.172
but there's no tearing,
no bruising,

12:07.173 --> 12:09.207
no signs of force.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.009
Her partner used a condom.

12:11.010 --> 12:13.511
It looks consensual.

12:19.218 --> 12:22.287
- Olive oil on the skin?

12:22.288 --> 12:24.856
- Yeah, balsam too.

12:24.857 --> 12:27.559
- Mixed with olive oil...
Makes myrrh.

12:30.162 --> 12:34.699
So she had sex.
She showered twice.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.535
Scrubbed herself raw.

12:37.536 --> 12:40.972
And anointed herself
with holy oil.

12:42.942 --> 12:44.676
- Two showers?

12:44.677 --> 12:46.010
Well, maybe she's got o.C.D.

12:46.011 --> 12:47.278
- Captain, the lab broke down

12:47.279 --> 12:48.646
the soap residue
under her nails.

12:48.647 --> 12:49.681
This isn't commercial.

12:49.682 --> 12:51.282
It's custom, luxury soap.

12:51.283 --> 12:54.519
Distributor says only three
hotels in Manhattan use it.

12:58.257 --> 12:59.924
- So she was sitting here?

12:59.925 --> 13:02.927
- Yes, the waiter said she
bought an orange juice.

13:02.928 --> 13:04.429
She seemed nervous.

13:04.430 --> 13:06.965
Security just downloaded
lobby camera footage.

13:09.268 --> 13:11.703
Here's where the gentleman you
see on the screen showed up.

13:17.743 --> 13:20.378
- Can you freeze that?

13:25.151 --> 13:29.253
Cordial, not personal.

13:35.253 --> 13:36.654
Checked the floor indicator.

13:36.655 --> 13:39.990
It stopped at two and
four and now seven.

13:39.991 --> 13:42.226
- The hotel manager
said the monsignor

13:42.227 --> 13:45.329
registered under the name Mr.
Jenkins.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.264
- Did they leave together?

13:49.301 --> 13:51.168
- There she is. Alone.

13:51.169 --> 13:52.703
- She has wet hair.

13:52.704 --> 13:53.804
- Shower number one was here,

13:53.805 --> 13:55.472
number two was at home.
- Mm.

13:55.473 --> 13:59.844
- The toxicology found 800
micrograms of Diazepam,

13:59.845 --> 14:02.546
and blood alcohol was.04.

14:02.547 --> 14:04.582
- Means she was putty.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.650
The killer could have
put a gun in her hand,

14:06.651 --> 14:07.952
made it look like suicide.

14:07.953 --> 14:11.722
- Well, before we
jump to conclusions,

14:11.723 --> 14:14.225
let's find out more
about our monsignor.

14:17.062 --> 14:19.797
- Monsignor mcteal
started soup kitchens,

14:19.798 --> 14:21.966
food banks, orphanages.

14:21.967 --> 14:23.234
He's dynamo.

14:23.235 --> 14:25.502
- We saw him at
children's hospital.

14:25.503 --> 14:28.572
- In church circles, they
call him "the consoler."

14:28.573 --> 14:30.174
- Does he also console women

14:30.175 --> 14:32.710
in their time of emotional need?

14:36.548 --> 14:39.950
- But no official complaints
against the monsignor?

14:39.951 --> 14:42.419
- There was an
unrelated complaint

14:42.420 --> 14:44.088
we passed on to his office.

14:44.089 --> 14:46.023
Someone said that they hadn't
received their settlement

14:46.024 --> 14:48.893
from the archdiocese.

14:48.894 --> 14:50.194
- Alice garvey?

14:50.195 --> 14:53.464
- For years, I carried
the shame of that abuse

14:53.465 --> 14:55.833
without telling a soul.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.268
And I can't do it anymore.

14:57.269 --> 15:00.838
It's-it's time to come clean.

15:00.839 --> 15:03.674
It feels good.

15:03.675 --> 15:07.144
Hiding a secret like that...

15:07.145 --> 15:08.946
Festers.

15:08.947 --> 15:11.548
Makes you rotten inside.

15:14.986 --> 15:17.588
- I'm Ilana, Alice's niece.

15:17.589 --> 15:20.457
- She's in here?
- Yes.

15:22.827 --> 15:25.629
- She was in a car accident
a couple months ago.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.798
Traumatic brain injury.

15:27.799 --> 15:32.169
She could be like this
the rest of her life.

15:32.170 --> 15:35.606
- Body of Christ.

15:35.607 --> 15:39.476
Body of Christ.
- Amen.

15:39.477 --> 15:42.713
The body of Christ.

15:42.714 --> 15:45.015
- I know what you did.

15:49.020 --> 15:52.556
- Last year she won a ten-year
legal battle with the church.

15:52.557 --> 15:54.425
That was before the accident.

15:54.426 --> 15:56.226
- The money never c came.

15:56.227 --> 15:59.730
- Hmm. Does it look it?

15:59.731 --> 16:01.966
- So she won a legal battle,

16:01.967 --> 16:04.034
but then lost her
mental faculties

16:04.035 --> 16:05.336
before she could collect?

16:05.337 --> 16:07.538
- Did you file a complaint

16:07.539 --> 16:10.341
with monsignor mcteal's office?

16:10.342 --> 16:12.276
- He represents the archdiocese.

16:12.277 --> 16:14.044
They said the money was paid,

16:14.045 --> 16:15.779
but that's just not true.

16:23.154 --> 16:25.889
- Monsignor.

16:25.890 --> 16:27.591
- Detectives.

16:27.592 --> 16:31.862
- You met Theresa at the St.
Regis after business hours.

16:31.863 --> 16:35.032
- Yes, we worked together
on a settlement account.

16:35.033 --> 16:37.868
- And what was Mr.
Jenkins doing?

16:37.869 --> 16:40.537
- My anonymity is
sometimes necessary

16:40.538 --> 16:42.072
for sensitive discussions.

16:42.073 --> 16:43.941
- And midnight trysts.

16:51.416 --> 16:53.417
- We discussed business.

16:53.418 --> 16:55.219
- In the shower.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.621
- I'm sorry. Should I know
what you're talking about?

16:57.622 --> 17:01.592
- Yes, you should.
She took a shower.

17:04.229 --> 17:07.564
The business that
you, uh, discussed,

17:07.565 --> 17:09.833
was that Alice
garvey's settlement?

17:09.834 --> 17:12.703
'Cause we just met her niece.

17:12.704 --> 17:15.705
- A relative of Alice garvey's

17:15.707 --> 17:18.876
filed a complaint that she had
not yet received her money.

17:18.877 --> 17:21.244
So I looked into it.

17:21.246 --> 17:23.146
Theresa's pass code was used

17:23.147 --> 17:27.651
to wire Alice garvey's money
into an offshore bank.

17:27.652 --> 17:31.088
- Theresa embezzled
$2.7 million?

17:31.089 --> 17:32.723
- Well, I didn't ask her
to confirm or deny.

17:32.724 --> 17:34.191
I just told her that
she had five days

17:34.192 --> 17:36.527
to put that money back
into the account.

17:36.528 --> 17:38.796
- Spends her career
helping victims

17:38.797 --> 17:40.664
and then she steals
a settlement?

17:40.665 --> 17:42.266
- She found out
garvey was non compos

17:42.267 --> 17:44.301
and grabbed the opportunity.

17:44.302 --> 17:46.003
- Well, if she stole the money,

17:46.004 --> 17:47.704
she-she had to have a reason.

17:47.705 --> 17:49.039
- Greed?

17:49.040 --> 17:50.507
- Yeah, but she lives
within her means.

17:50.508 --> 17:52.342
I mean, she had three pairs
of shoes in her closet.

17:52.343 --> 17:54.278
- Maybe she was sick of it.

17:54.279 --> 17:55.979
- I.T. Retrieved and catalogued

17:55.980 --> 18:00.250
everything on Theresa's
home and office computers.

18:02.921 --> 18:04.888
This was erased from her iPad.

18:04.889 --> 18:07.424
We had to pull it
off the server.

18:07.425 --> 18:09.660
- "To whom it may concern.

18:09.661 --> 18:12.362
I took the money."

18:12.363 --> 18:15.232
Theresa's suicide note?

18:15.233 --> 18:18.068
- Looks like your
case just closed.

18:23.039 --> 18:24.006
We don't buy it.

18:24.007 --> 18:25.274
We need to go further

18:25.275 --> 18:26.742
before we can close
this as a suicide.

18:26.743 --> 18:28.844
- Why, because the
note's on an iPad?

18:28.845 --> 18:31.847
- Because of the embezzlement.

18:31.848 --> 18:33.815
- With that suicide note,

18:33.816 --> 18:37.553
no D.A.
In his right mind would file.

18:37.554 --> 18:41.590
Joe, don't be a moron.
We have legit suspects.

18:48.565 --> 18:50.999
- You give us the room a minute?

19:02.946 --> 19:05.180
Bobby, I appreciate
you coming back.

19:05.181 --> 19:07.583
I really do.

19:07.584 --> 19:12.487
But this doesn't work.

19:12.488 --> 19:14.256
I know what you do.

19:14.257 --> 19:17.259
And you know what I do.

19:17.260 --> 19:19.328
I've got your back,

19:19.329 --> 19:23.131
and you respect my face
and don't get in it.

19:29.305 --> 19:30.906
- Detective goren?

19:30.907 --> 19:32.674
I'm Paula geisen.

19:32.675 --> 19:34.676
Come on in.

19:34.677 --> 19:37.079
- Sorry I'm late.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.880
- Well, it's tough to
get away from your job.

19:38.881 --> 19:43.518
- No excuse.

19:43.519 --> 19:46.455
Your office, it's, uh, striking.

19:46.456 --> 19:47.556
- Thank you.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.925
- These two doors,

19:49.926 --> 19:52.761
they remind me of a riddle.

19:52.762 --> 19:54.329
You know the one?

19:54.330 --> 19:57.399
Two identical doors.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.868
Two identical guards.

19:59.869 --> 20:03.171
One guard is an angel
guarding heaven,

20:03.172 --> 20:05.140
he always tells the truth.

20:05.141 --> 20:08.277
And the other guard is
a devil guarding hell.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.045
He always has to lie.

20:10.046 --> 20:12.347
You have one question to ask

20:12.348 --> 20:15.951
to get into heaven.

20:15.952 --> 20:19.021
What would that question be?

20:19.022 --> 20:20.055
You'll never get it.

20:20.056 --> 20:23.325
It's...You'll...

20:23.326 --> 20:25.127
- Give me time.

20:25.128 --> 20:28.930
- Uh, also the
missed appointments,

20:28.931 --> 20:31.366
I apologize.

20:31.367 --> 20:35.237
- I'm sure you had good
reasons not to come.

20:35.238 --> 20:36.672
- You don't have to do that.

20:36.673 --> 20:39.741
- How do you mean?
- Empathize with me.

20:39.742 --> 20:42.210
- Is that what you
think I'm doing?

20:42.211 --> 20:44.513
- Yeah, "I'm sure you had
reason not to come."

20:44.514 --> 20:47.149
You know, "your job
is too tough...

20:47.150 --> 20:48.617
To get away from."

20:48.618 --> 20:52.020
You're trying to gain my trust.

20:52.021 --> 20:55.157
- I don't think that would
be that easy to do.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.195
- Is that what it
says in my file?

21:00.196 --> 21:01.797
- That?

21:01.798 --> 21:05.434
That's only part of your file.

21:05.435 --> 21:08.136
- Did you accept to do this

21:08.137 --> 21:10.605
before or after you read it?

21:10.606 --> 21:12.074
- After.

21:12.075 --> 21:14.109
- And after the more
experienced psychiatrists

21:14.110 --> 21:15.210
begged off?

21:15.211 --> 21:20.682
- I didn't have to
fight to get you.

21:20.683 --> 21:22.984
And it wasn't only the files.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.789
Seven employer-mandated sessions

21:27.790 --> 21:30.625
with someone...

21:30.626 --> 21:31.960
As challenging as you...

21:31.961 --> 21:36.531
- You were gonna say
"crazy," weren't you?

21:36.532 --> 21:38.734
- Why do you think that?

21:38.735 --> 21:42.671
- Do you think I'm crazy?

21:42.672 --> 21:44.840
- I think you are a person

21:44.841 --> 21:48.210
who is aware that the world
is a dangerous place.

21:48.211 --> 21:50.545
You found a way of surviving,

21:50.546 --> 21:54.449
but your way can
make other people

21:54.450 --> 21:56.752
feel uncomfortable.

21:59.422 --> 22:03.024
- "Challenging" and, you
know, "uncomfortable."

22:03.025 --> 22:05.827
You're walking on egg
shells with me, aren't you?

22:05.828 --> 22:08.497
- Isn't that how you like it?
Hmm?

22:08.498 --> 22:10.665
It's part of your skill set,

22:10.666 --> 22:13.301
like being able to
read people quickly.

22:16.672 --> 22:17.906
- It's my job.

22:17.907 --> 22:19.007
- Sure.

22:19.008 --> 22:20.876
It's protected you.

22:20.877 --> 22:23.412
But it's also taken its toll

22:23.413 --> 22:27.449
on those around you
and on yourself.

22:27.450 --> 22:30.152
You are exceptional
at analyzing others.

22:30.153 --> 22:34.022
Exceptional.

22:34.023 --> 22:36.825
So what is it that you
think will happen

22:36.826 --> 22:39.227
if you start looking
at yourself?

22:46.803 --> 22:48.403
- I didn't tell you
about the embezzlement

22:48.404 --> 22:49.971
because I didn't know.

22:49.972 --> 22:52.841
- So overseeing accounts isn't
part of the job description?

22:52.842 --> 22:54.843
- Oversee, not monitor
every transaction.

22:54.844 --> 22:57.813
- 2.7 million didn't
warrant your attention?

22:57.814 --> 22:59.214
- It's a great deal of money,

22:59.215 --> 23:00.682
but it's not an
atypical settlement.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.584
- Plus we thought we'd
settled with Alice garvey.

23:02.585 --> 23:04.052
We sent her the papers.

23:04.053 --> 23:09.090
- You said that you watched
mediation DVDs with Theresa.

23:09.091 --> 23:11.326
- Yeah, I did.

23:11.327 --> 23:13.328
- She was looking for
God's perfect match.

23:13.329 --> 23:15.096
Maybe you were it.

23:15.097 --> 23:17.032
- She was my boss.
We were just friends.

23:17.033 --> 23:19.334
- We are gonna let our lawyers
handle things from here on in.

23:19.335 --> 23:21.303
Obviously, we'll be doing
our own investigation.

23:21.304 --> 23:22.671
- So will we.

23:22.672 --> 23:24.506
There was a lamp on this table,

23:24.507 --> 23:26.308
and her pictures are gone.

23:26.309 --> 23:27.709
- Johnny let a friend of hers

23:27.710 --> 23:29.444
come in and take some of
her personal effects.

23:29.445 --> 23:31.546
- Is that Natalie?

23:31.547 --> 23:33.348
- Uh, yeah, they were buddies.

23:33.349 --> 23:34.950
- You let someone remove
possible evidence

23:34.951 --> 23:37.285
from an ongoing investigation?

23:37.286 --> 23:39.054
- We're bankers, not police.

23:42.124 --> 23:44.459
- Uh, I went to her office

23:44.460 --> 23:46.728
to box up her things
for her parents.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.296
I ran into Johnny.

23:48.297 --> 23:49.898
We talked a little.

23:49.899 --> 23:51.967
- Googled you.

23:51.968 --> 23:55.203
You were 57th in the
tennis rankings at 18.

23:55.204 --> 23:57.739
- Oh, ancient history.

23:57.740 --> 24:01.243
- Then drug possession and
petty theft in your 20s.

24:01.244 --> 24:04.312
And now you're over
$70,000 in debt.

24:04.313 --> 24:09.885
- 73,600, to be exact.

24:11.787 --> 24:12.921
- That's a cute cat.

24:12.922 --> 24:16.191
- Oh, um, name's pyewacket.

24:16.192 --> 24:18.660
- Pyewacket?

24:18.661 --> 24:19.728
That's from a...

24:19.729 --> 24:22.464
Jimmy Stewart film.

24:22.465 --> 24:28.603
Yeah, the cat, it was Kim
novak's best friend.

24:28.604 --> 24:30.839
It's a funny movie.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.641
I think the cat was a wizard.

24:32.642 --> 24:33.608
Not very catholic.

24:33.609 --> 24:36.278
- It's a cat.

24:36.279 --> 24:40.115
- So you and Theresa were
roommates at Georgetown.

24:40.116 --> 24:41.816
Very catholic.

24:41.817 --> 24:44.085
- She got me into rehab.

24:44.086 --> 24:46.421
Back into the church.

24:46.422 --> 24:48.924
- Did you know that-
that Theresa was accused

24:48.925 --> 24:50.792
of, uh, stealing
millions of dollars

24:50.793 --> 24:52.861
from the church
settlement account?

24:56.432 --> 24:58.600
Yeah, I know, it...

24:58.601 --> 25:00.135
Doesn't make sense.

25:00.136 --> 25:02.737
But there must have
been a reason.

25:02.738 --> 25:05.874
She didn't have a lot of
experience with men, did she?

25:05.875 --> 25:08.009
- How many straight,
single men in their 30s

25:08.010 --> 25:10.645
are still practicing catholics
and not total weirdoes?

25:10.646 --> 25:14.616
- Johnny's pretty cute.
How about him?

25:14.617 --> 25:17.185
- She was his boss. No way.

25:22.358 --> 25:27.195
- You're lying.

25:27.196 --> 25:28.763
- Okay.

25:28.764 --> 25:31.166
I mean, maybe they
hooked up once or tw&e,

25:31.167 --> 25:32.701
but it-it was casual.

25:32.702 --> 25:34.202
- They were friends, though.

25:34.203 --> 25:37.105
I mean, she liked him, though.

25:37.106 --> 25:39.341
- Yeah.

25:39.342 --> 25:41.576
A lot.

25:48.584 --> 25:50.952
- You lied to us, Johnny.

25:54.323 --> 25:58.893
- Johnny.
You slept with your boss.

25:58.894 --> 26:02.030
- All right, I'll
be honest with you,

26:02.031 --> 26:06.167
I didn't want to admit it
in front of kilpatrick.

26:06.168 --> 26:07.769
- Can't be that dumb.

26:07.770 --> 26:11.139
I mean, lying to two cops in
a homicide investigation?

26:11.140 --> 26:14.342
Really?
Did you just cop to a felony?

26:14.343 --> 26:17.145
- We hooked up a month ago.

26:17.146 --> 26:18.146
It was no big deal.

26:18.147 --> 26:19.781
Once, maybe twice.

26:19.782 --> 26:22.550
- So the pillow talk wasn't
about where to stash the 2.7?

26:22.551 --> 26:24.819
- This sounds like
I need a lawyer.

26:24.820 --> 26:26.988
- Do you need a lawyer?
I don't know.

26:26.989 --> 26:28.156
Right now you're just a...

26:28.157 --> 26:29.691
you're a person of interest.

26:29.692 --> 26:33.595
Lawyer up, well, that takes you
straight up to maybe suspect.

26:33.596 --> 26:36.097
- You guys, I didn't
steal the money.

26:37.099 --> 26:38.566
The night Theresa died,

26:38.567 --> 26:40.368
she called me and told
me that monsignor mcteal

26:40.369 --> 26:42.504
accused her of embezzlement.

26:42.505 --> 26:45.040
The next day Natalie told me

26:45.041 --> 26:47.142
he asked Theresa for sex

26:47.143 --> 26:50.912
in exchange for giving her five
days to replace the money.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.180
- What was your reaction?

26:52.181 --> 26:54.416
- I wanted to kill the bastard.

26:54.417 --> 26:58.553
I figured it had to be
an accounting mistake.

26:58.554 --> 27:00.021
- No, no, no. She stole it.

27:00.022 --> 27:01.256
There's no question about that.

27:01.257 --> 27:04.959
- No. You're wrong.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.528
We both felt the same way.

27:06.529 --> 27:08.830
The only people that
deserved that money

27:08.831 --> 27:11.399
are victims.

27:13.135 --> 27:16.871
- So the monsignor forced
Theresa to have sex

27:16.872 --> 27:18.807
quid pro quo

27:18.808 --> 27:21.476
for giving her five days
to return the money?

27:21.477 --> 27:24.112
- She's so remorseful,
she kills herself.

27:26.749 --> 27:28.983
- Five days to return the money,

27:28.984 --> 27:33.822
she goes home and kills herself.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.824
You know, look at this.

27:35.825 --> 27:39.027
Uh...

27:39.028 --> 27:40.929
"What I have now done

27:40.930 --> 27:42.831
was the only path left for me."

27:42.832 --> 27:45.233
- So formal.
- Yeah.

27:45.234 --> 27:46.935
- Here all night?

27:46.936 --> 27:49.003
- You bring bagels?

27:49.004 --> 27:52.407
- See, men, women, they
leave different markers

27:52.408 --> 27:54.375
when they write suicide notes.

27:54.376 --> 27:57.212
Women seem to rely more heavily

27:57.213 --> 27:59.380
on expression of feelings,

27:59.381 --> 28:02.217
like, um, thanking someone.

28:02.218 --> 28:04.519
You know, polite speech.
Apologizing.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.887
- She was close to her parents,

28:05.888 --> 28:07.722
and they're not even mentioned.

28:07.723 --> 28:09.090
- Yes.

28:13.295 --> 28:16.898
"I acted out of greed
and poor character."

28:16.899 --> 28:18.566
See, now that's a
direct admission,

28:18.567 --> 28:22.237
but there's no reference
to God or the Bible,

28:22.238 --> 28:25.540
or any misgivings for breaking
the eighth commandment.

28:25.541 --> 28:29.477
- The $2.7 million question is...

28:29.478 --> 28:31.780
Why was it erased?

28:31.781 --> 28:34.015
- Yeah, I don't know.

28:34.016 --> 28:38.987
But I do know that
she didn't write it.

28:38.988 --> 28:43.358
The killer wants her death
to look like a suicide,

28:43.359 --> 28:47.362
but he puts the gun four
feet away from the body.

28:47.363 --> 28:49.898
Doesn't make any sense.

28:49.899 --> 28:51.599
- The cat.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.768
- Yes, I have pyewacket.

28:53.769 --> 28:55.870
I decided to keep him.

28:55.871 --> 28:58.406
- You ever feed him when
Theresa worked late,

28:58.407 --> 29:00.441
or when she was out of town?

29:00.442 --> 29:02.710
- Um, can I get
back to my lesson?

29:02.711 --> 29:04.779
- So you have your own
key to her apartment?

29:04.780 --> 29:06.414
- No.

29:06.415 --> 29:08.416
- Is that why you asked the
building super to let you in?

29:08.417 --> 29:10.151
- Right.

29:10.152 --> 29:12.554
- You wanted him
to corroborate you

29:12.555 --> 29:14.422
finding the dead body.

29:14.423 --> 29:16.925
But you already
knew she was dead.

29:16.926 --> 29:21.095
- I don't have a key.

29:21.096 --> 29:22.697
- Well, we got a warrant.

29:22.698 --> 29:24.933
We searched your apartment.

29:29.371 --> 29:32.473
- Fine. I had a key.

29:32.474 --> 29:36.077
- Neighbor says she saw you
heading up the stairs at 8:15.

29:36.078 --> 29:39.480
Constantine says you
got him at 8:35.

29:39.481 --> 29:41.249
Maybe you found a way

29:41.250 --> 29:43.585
to access Theresa's
account at work.

29:43.586 --> 29:46.754
When Theresa tipped onto
it, you killed her.

29:46.755 --> 29:50.892
- That's ridiculous.
She was my best friend.

29:50.893 --> 29:56.731
- Uh, now she turned
your life around.

29:56.732 --> 29:58.933
Didn't she?

29:58.934 --> 30:03.905
And you'd do anything
to protect her.

30:03.906 --> 30:05.673
And in the eyes of
the catholic church,

30:05.674 --> 30:08.409
a suicide is the same as murder.

30:14.316 --> 30:17.585
- When Tess didn't answer,

30:17.586 --> 30:21.089
I let myself in.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.524
I found her on the
floor of the bedroom,

30:23.525 --> 30:25.627
and she'd shot herself.

30:28.497 --> 30:30.732
She wouldn't be
able to have a mass

30:30.733 --> 30:33.835
or be buried in
consecrated ground.

30:33.836 --> 30:36.871
- So you kicked the gun away
and you repositioned the body.

30:36.872 --> 30:41.542
- She committed suicide, but
the monsignor was responsible.

30:41.543 --> 30:45.013
- That's why you erased the
suicide note on her iPad.

30:49.118 --> 30:51.886
- What suicide note?

31:01.528 --> 31:03.695
Natalie admits she
dutched the crime scene.

31:03.696 --> 31:04.596
That's obstruction.

31:04.631 --> 31:06.832
- So who erased
the suicide note?

31:06.833 --> 31:10.169
- Not Natalie. The killer?

31:10.170 --> 31:11.637
- Why?

31:11.638 --> 31:14.139
- As a fail-safe.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.075
Police close the
case as a suicide,

31:16.076 --> 31:17.610
then he's home free.

31:17.611 --> 31:19.879
If not, then he knows that
they'll scrub her computers

31:19.880 --> 31:21.280
and find the note.

31:21.281 --> 31:25.184
- Natalie said Hugh
mcteal extorted Theresa.

31:25.185 --> 31:27.386
- She didn't realllly
say that, captain.

31:27.387 --> 31:28.721
- Maybe not word for word,

31:28.722 --> 31:32.324
but close enough.

31:32.325 --> 31:35.060
Let's bring him in and sweat
him for suspicion of rape.

31:37.197 --> 31:41.901
- Did you rape Theresa esperna?

31:41.902 --> 31:43.002
- Absolutely not.

31:43.003 --> 31:44.670
Is that why you
brought me in here?

31:44.671 --> 31:45.971
- Look, if your strategy

31:45.972 --> 31:47.306
is to drag the church
through the mud...

31:47.307 --> 31:49.875
- we have no agenda
against the church.

31:49.876 --> 31:52.077
For every story you
hear of misconduct,

31:52.078 --> 31:55.548
there are thousands of
stories of good works.

31:55.549 --> 31:57.383
- Well, that's the first

31:57.384 --> 32:00.586
true thing you've said
all day, detective.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.755
- You know, I was thinking,

32:02.756 --> 32:06.292
you know, an episcopalian
priest can...

32:06.293 --> 32:07.359
well, they can have a wife,

32:07.360 --> 32:09.595
and a lutheran pastor,

32:09.596 --> 32:11.297
they can date a playmate.

32:11.298 --> 32:14.199
You have, uh, vows of chastity.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.001
- Mm.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.871
A vocation demands sacrifice.

32:18.872 --> 32:22.575
- Jeez, it must be...
Frustrating.

32:24.177 --> 32:26.312
- Temptation is a test

32:26.313 --> 32:27.546
that God gives all of us.

32:27.547 --> 32:29.214
- Well, it seems to be
a test you're failing.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.716
- I'm no different
from any other man.

32:30.717 --> 32:32.651
How about you, detective goren?

32:32.652 --> 32:34.587
Any frailties of your own?

32:34.588 --> 32:36.188
- Look, we're within
a minute of walking

32:36.189 --> 32:40.526
if we don't hear a charge.

32:40.527 --> 32:41.961
- You can...

32:41.962 --> 32:45.998
Love the church for
their good works,

32:45.999 --> 32:47.533
or you can hate the church

32:47.534 --> 32:51.337
for their...Hypocrisy.

32:51.338 --> 32:55.741
Tick tock.
Ti- how much time do I have left?

32:55.742 --> 32:58.277
Go ahead. No. How much?

33:03.750 --> 33:07.286
But both sides agree...

33:09.522 --> 33:12.658
Thou shalt not kill.

33:12.659 --> 33:16.261
- I did not kill Theresa.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.163
- Okay, forget about the murder.

33:18.164 --> 33:21.967
Theresa's friend says you
forced her to have sex.

33:21.968 --> 33:23.302
- Never happened.

33:23.303 --> 33:26.438
- Well, there's no way we
can prove it forensically,

33:26.439 --> 33:30.442
because you're careful,
and used a condom.

33:30.443 --> 33:31.877
Oh, I forgot.

33:31.878 --> 33:34.880
That's another sin, isn't it?

33:34.881 --> 33:37.583
You're...

33:37.584 --> 33:39.118
The consoler?

33:39.119 --> 33:40.486
- Don't push it, detective.

33:40.487 --> 33:42.821
- You take advantage
of vulnerable women.

33:42.822 --> 33:45.658
Isn't that the basis
of the scandal?

33:45.659 --> 33:47.526
Priests taking advantage
of the vulnerable.

33:47.527 --> 33:49.128
- I'm not a molester.

33:49.129 --> 33:50.396
- But you broke your vows.

33:50.397 --> 33:53.032
- I feed 35,000 orphans
in five boroughs.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.034
- Yeah, and you're held
to a higher standard.

33:55.035 --> 33:57.002
- I built a cancer
hospital last year.

33:57.003 --> 34:00.205
- Did you know that
Theresa showered twice

34:00.206 --> 34:01.840
after visiting you at the St.
Regis?

34:05.745 --> 34:08.714
Twice.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.983
What do you think about
that, monsignor?

34:10.984 --> 34:16.688
As evidence of a guilty
mind or a tortured soul?

34:16.690 --> 34:19.858
She was disgusted by you.

34:19.859 --> 34:23.629
She scrubbed every place
that you touched her.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.107
- Hmm.

34:35.108 --> 34:39.110
Well, you got me, detective.

34:39.112 --> 34:42.147
Yep.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.849
I occasionally have
sex with women.

34:48.655 --> 34:51.322
Consenting women.

34:51.324 --> 34:53.158
It's a flaw that
I'm not proud of.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.994
That does not, however,
make me a murderer.

35:10.176 --> 35:13.011
Cardinal.

35:13.012 --> 35:16.315
I, uh...

35:22.922 --> 35:25.591
- I'll see you in my
office in the morning.

35:33.133 --> 35:36.602
- You got some
hail Marys coming.

35:45.845 --> 35:47.613
- Slime.

35:47.614 --> 35:49.915
- But smart.

35:49.916 --> 35:52.851
Picked on women who aren't
gonna go after the settlement.

35:52.852 --> 35:54.119
He'll stick to his story

35:54.120 --> 35:56.555
that Theresa was
embezzling the money.

35:56.556 --> 35:59.124
- Johnny admitted
Theresa told him

35:59.125 --> 36:01.226
about the embezzlement
before she died.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.661
- But not the sex.

36:02.662 --> 36:05.230
- She told Natalie about
sex with the monsignor.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.732
- But not the theft.

36:06.733 --> 36:08.734
- A confession in two parts.

36:08.735 --> 36:10.936
- Either way, she
betrayed her faith.

36:10.937 --> 36:14.940
- This is about her faith.

36:14.941 --> 36:16.175
She did it for someone.

36:16.176 --> 36:18.744
Uomeone who she thought
deserved the money.

36:42.235 --> 36:45.504
Sorry.

36:45.505 --> 36:47.739
Let me just, uh...

36:51.477 --> 36:53.312
Whoo!

36:59.018 --> 37:00.618
Okay.

37:03.823 --> 37:09.061
Two weeks ago, the monsignor
gave a gun to Theresa,

37:09.062 --> 37:12.564
because of an angry abuse victim

37:12.565 --> 37:16.235
who felt that he was
cheated out of, uh...

37:16.236 --> 37:19.338
His payoff.

37:19.339 --> 37:22.774
- Uh, he was harmless.
Just angry.

37:22.775 --> 37:24.676
- Now, that was
around the same time

37:24.677 --> 37:27.379
that you and Theresa were...

37:30.216 --> 37:34.119
Uh...

37:34.120 --> 37:37.723
You know, knocking boots.

37:37.724 --> 37:39.291
- That's crassly correct.

37:39.292 --> 37:41.560
- What's your point, detective?

37:44.330 --> 37:47.299
- Well, I think that...

37:47.300 --> 37:50.669
That you told Theresa something...

37:50.670 --> 37:53.338
That you never
told another soul.

37:59.212 --> 38:03.248
.451.

38:03.249 --> 38:04.950
Freshman year's batting average.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.818
I mean, wow.

38:06.819 --> 38:08.353
I think that's amazing.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.222
You know.

38:10.223 --> 38:12.491
All right, look.

38:12.492 --> 38:14.559
I mean, you must
have been, what?

38:14.560 --> 38:16.461
15?

38:19.265 --> 38:21.633
.451?

38:21.634 --> 38:23.869
You must have been
in great shape.

38:23.870 --> 38:25.337
Freshman year.

38:25.338 --> 38:28.340
I have, uh, this marked here.

38:28.341 --> 38:30.242
There's father Duffy.

38:30.243 --> 38:34.446
Now, he was the varsity
baseball coach

38:34.447 --> 38:37.649
who was fired for...

38:37.650 --> 38:42.587
For improper relations.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.823
- I remember father Duffy.

38:52.432 --> 38:55.834
- Do you know how much

38:55.835 --> 38:59.271
the Franklin county
settlement was

38:59.272 --> 39:01.540
to each abuse victim?

39:01.541 --> 39:04.743
After the parish went bankrupt?

39:04.744 --> 39:07.512
Do you know? It was $11,000.

39:07.513 --> 39:11.149
So Alice garvey got 2.7 million,

39:11.150 --> 39:13.385
and you got 11 grand.

39:13.386 --> 39:14.953
- I wasn't molested.

39:14.954 --> 39:18.991
- Come on, Johnny.

39:18.992 --> 39:20.659
Come on.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.094
You of all people know

39:22.095 --> 39:24.863
that denial is common among...

39:24.864 --> 39:29.601
Abuse victims.

39:29.602 --> 39:31.737
I mean, that's why you didn't
have any baseball pictures

39:31.738 --> 39:35.440
from Franklin catholic
in your office.

39:39.946 --> 39:45.117
Did you know that abuse victims,

39:45.118 --> 39:46.585
they try and attach themselves,

39:46.586 --> 39:50.722
in many cases, to their abuser.

39:50.723 --> 39:54.059
Like a man who works in a bank,

39:54.060 --> 39:57.062
whose main client is
the catholic church...

39:57.063 --> 39:58.964
- I took the job
because the church

39:58.965 --> 40:00.532
is helping victims of abuse.

40:00.533 --> 40:04.369
- Yes, that's right.

40:04.370 --> 40:06.338
Right.

40:06.339 --> 40:07.773
Ïso there Theresa is.

40:07.774 --> 40:12.511
Now, she's writing multi-million
dollar settlement checks.

40:12.512 --> 40:13.945
Every day.

40:13.946 --> 40:17.382
Uh, helping people that
she didn't even know.

40:19.786 --> 40:21.386
And you got stiffed
in Franklin county.

40:21.387 --> 40:22.554
- I wasn't molested.

40:22.555 --> 40:26.958
- Giving you a fair
settlement was impossible.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.326
You know, what was she gonna do?

40:28.327 --> 40:31.530
You know, write you a check?

40:36.469 --> 40:40.806
When did you find out about
Alice garvey's car accident?

40:45.344 --> 40:50.215
Was that the night that you
hooked up with Theresa?

40:50.216 --> 40:53.652
You slithered into
this lonely woman,

40:53.653 --> 40:58.657
this woman who had sympathy
for the abuse you suffered.

40:58.658 --> 40:59.991
- That's not what happened.

40:59.992 --> 41:01.793
- There's absolutely no
proof that he was...

41:01.794 --> 41:02.994
- come on, Johnny!

41:02.995 --> 41:06.798
Come on!

41:06.799 --> 41:08.333
What could you do?

41:08.334 --> 41:09.935
I mean, you weren't gonna
give the money back.

41:09.936 --> 41:12.204
You deserved it. Right?

41:12.205 --> 41:15.507
You deserved it for the
vile and disgusting things

41:15.508 --> 41:18.443
that father Duffy did to you.

41:18.444 --> 41:21.980
And Theresa was the only
one that knew the truth.

41:26.586 --> 41:29.788
And the truth would
die with her.

41:29.789 --> 41:31.389
So what'd you do?

41:31.390 --> 41:33.959
You went over there, you
opened a bottle of wine,

41:33.960 --> 41:37.262
you popped a pill in her glass.

41:37.263 --> 41:41.433
She drank it, she got wasted.

41:41.434 --> 41:42.434
And boom!

41:42.435 --> 41:44.236
- No.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.441
- Father Duffy took
advantage of you.

41:49.442 --> 41:53.044
You took advantage of Theresa.

41:53.045 --> 41:55.780
And the abused
became the abuser.

42:05.725 --> 42:07.792
The iPad note?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.861
Remember that?

42:09.862 --> 42:13.098
You know, I always knew that...

42:13.099 --> 42:14.799
that she didn't write it,

42:14.800 --> 42:16.735
but I-I was up all night

42:16.736 --> 42:19.137
trying to figure out
what it really was.

42:22.375 --> 42:23.775
Your confession.

42:23.776 --> 42:26.711
"To whom it may concern.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.213
"I took the money.

42:28.214 --> 42:30.749
"I acted out of greed

42:30.750 --> 42:32.584
"and poor character.

42:32.585 --> 42:35.253
"Shame was too much to bear.

42:35.254 --> 42:39.691
"What I have now done was
the only path left for me.

42:39.692 --> 42:42.994
"I had no choice.

42:42.995 --> 42:47.532
Johnny."

42:47.533 --> 42:50.702
- I didn't mean to kill her.

42:50.703 --> 42:53.605
I didn't want to kill her.

43:02.682 --> 43:05.617
- No, you didn't mean to.

43:05.618 --> 43:09.354
You didn't want to.

43:09.355 --> 43:12.023
But you did.
