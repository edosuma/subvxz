00:04.380 --> 00:07.330
Raven: Raven's Home
was filmed in front
of a live studio audience.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.880
-(phone pings)
-Hoo! Hey, check it out!

00:09.880 --> 00:13.170
Marley Becker just Pal-ed me
on the school Peanut Page.

00:13.170 --> 00:17.670
That makes
27 Peanut Pals.
(chuckles)

00:17.670 --> 00:18.710
How many you got?

00:18.710 --> 00:20.120
Two hundred and thirty-one.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.250
Two hundred thirty-one?

00:22.250 --> 00:24.040
-(phone pings)
-Two thirty-two.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.330
Dude, how'd you get
so many pals?

00:26.330 --> 00:28.670
It's all about
attracting eyeballs.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.380
Feast your eyes on this.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.380
People really think
that's your body?

00:35.380 --> 00:37.170
How do you know it's not?

00:38.580 --> 00:41.710
I can't believe how much
you two care about how many
Peanut Pals you have.

00:41.710 --> 00:44.250
Sounds like
someone hasn't hit
her double digits yet.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.460
I'm at 90.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.500
Ninety?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.420
But unlike you,
I don't care.

00:49.420 --> 00:50.960
It's not like
I'm keeping track.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.500
-(phone pings)
-Ooh, 91!

00:53.500 --> 00:56.420
This-- This
is just wrong, okay?

00:56.420 --> 00:59.120
You two can't
have more Pals
than me.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.620
-(phone pings)
-And yet...

01:02.960 --> 01:05.540
You just need
some clickbait,

01:05.540 --> 01:07.210
and you've got
the greatest of all.

01:07.210 --> 01:10.380
Oh, yeah, my,
uh, killer dance moves.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.000
Take a vid.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.460
No.
What's the one thing
you have

01:14.460 --> 01:16.000
that no other kid
in school has?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.380
Twenty-seven pings!

01:18.460 --> 01:21.120
True... but I was
talking about his visions.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.380
Pizza!

01:23.380 --> 01:25.330
(cheering)

01:25.830 --> 01:27.540
And salad!

01:27.540 --> 01:29.290
Kids:
Ehh.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.580
Tomorrow night,
I wanna carry the pizza.

01:31.580 --> 01:32.710
All right.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.460
Last time I had a vision,
you took that video
of me, right?

01:36.460 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, it's on your phone.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.750
When I post this video,
I'll get tons of Pals.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.040
I'll be known
as the Psychic Peanut.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.790
Hi-yah!

01:48.620 --> 01:51.460

(laughing)

02:50.620 --> 02:52.710
I-- I think
you broke my phone, Ma.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.920
Oh, I will break
so much more than that

02:54.920 --> 02:56.710
if you tell the world you're
(whispers) psychic.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.620
Why are you whispering?
I thought the secret
was out.

03:00.620 --> 03:03.580
Well, it's out, yes,
but only within the family.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.040
And we're gonna keep it
that way.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.460
Heard there was
a family meeting.
What did I miss?

03:08.790 --> 03:11.000
Knocking, for starters.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.330
Sorry, just excited.

03:12.330 --> 03:15.330
-It's my first family meeting.
-Hey!

03:15.330 --> 03:16.460
Oh, pizza!

03:19.420 --> 03:22.120
You know what?
I'm just gonna take
this to go.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.380
(door shuts)

03:25.380 --> 03:27.920
Listen, Booker.
You have an amazing talent,

03:27.920 --> 03:29.670
I know this,
and it's super tempting

03:29.670 --> 03:30.710
to tell everybody,
but you can't.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.540
Why, Mom? All my friends
post everything online,

03:34.540 --> 03:37.540
so why should this
be any different?

03:37.540 --> 03:40.500
Because... pizza time!

03:40.500 --> 03:42.460
-Oh!
-Mom!

03:42.460 --> 03:44.420
"Because" isn't an answer.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.040
Um... it's always the answer
I got, and it's been fine

03:48.040 --> 03:50.040
for generations of Baxters.

03:50.620 --> 03:53.580
(playing harmonica)

03:58.580 --> 04:01.540
I don't get it, Ma.
They're my visions.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.960
And I want the kids
at the schoolhouse
to know about it.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.330
Especially that Maggie Cutter.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.620
-(spit)
-(clang)

04:09.040 --> 04:11.920
Now listen.
You my kin,
and I love you,

04:11.920 --> 04:15.460
but ain't gonna be
no crazy talk about
bein' no psychic.

04:15.710 --> 04:20.000
You're not gonna tell no man,
no minister, or no mule,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
especially that Maggie Cutter.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.120
-(spits)
-(clang)

04:23.920 --> 04:26.420
Why in tarnation not, Ma?

04:27.580 --> 04:30.620
Bee-cause.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.830
Seriously, Mom?
We were gold miners?

04:33.830 --> 04:37.460
Obviously not good ones,
otherwise we'd be having
lobster pizza.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.580
So, the reason we can't
tell people our secret

04:40.580 --> 04:43.460
is because...
of "because"?

04:45.580 --> 04:46.670
Why can't I get
a better answer?

04:46.670 --> 04:49.250
And please...
don't say "because."

04:50.040 --> 04:51.670
Okay, fine.
Chelsea?

04:51.670 --> 04:52.620
Because!

04:52.620 --> 04:54.420
-(both laughing)
-Yeah!

04:59.920 --> 05:01.580
Checking your Pal account
again, huh?

05:01.580 --> 05:05.790
Yeah.
I just don't get why Jared
won't accept my Pal request.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.710
I don't get why
you want him
as a Pal.

05:07.710 --> 05:09.290
You two have
nothing in common.

05:09.290 --> 05:10.500
That's not true.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.710
(all laughing)

05:12.710 --> 05:14.120
We both love his face.

05:15.790 --> 05:18.080
Come on, Nia.
You're an honor student,

05:18.080 --> 05:19.750
and you actually
care about things

05:19.750 --> 05:21.120
other than football.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.380
I'm not gonna let you
ruin this for me, Tess.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.380
So, flag on the play.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.580
Wow!
You used a football term?

05:29.580 --> 05:31.540
You must really like this guy.

05:33.210 --> 05:36.000
He's so cute.
So how do I get him
to Pal me?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.710
You could always do
what I do.

05:38.580 --> 05:40.620
I'm not gonna
put him in a headlock, Tess.

05:41.830 --> 05:44.380
His name is Mr. Manchego.

05:44.380 --> 05:47.170
Like the cheese.
But he smells better.

05:47.710 --> 05:48.670
Totes cute.

05:51.290 --> 05:54.880
Uh-- Levi?
How did you get
in there?

05:54.880 --> 05:57.120
Oh, Sienna's
one of my 300 Pals.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.290
Three hundred?

05:58.920 --> 06:01.380
She's very influential.

06:01.380 --> 06:04.290
Get her to Pal you,
and then her Pals
become your Pals.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.580
How am I gonna do that?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.080
Levi!
I just had a vision
of Sienna's puppy

06:20.080 --> 06:21.750
stuck on the roof
of our building!

06:21.750 --> 06:23.830
Aww, yeah-ha-ha!

06:25.790 --> 06:28.330
You're happy
about a lost puppy?

06:28.330 --> 06:29.420
You need help!

06:29.750 --> 06:32.710
No!
It's my in with Sienna.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.880
Once I warn her,
she'll be so thankful,
she'll Pal me.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.460
And then, I can just sit back
and enjoy the sweet pingin'

06:39.460 --> 06:40.580
of my new Pals.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.750
-Hey, Sienna.
-Hi, Boomer.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.210
It-- It-- It's Booker.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Anyway, uh, just
keep an eye on your dog.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.790
You wouldn't want
anything bad to happen
to him.

06:53.790 --> 06:54.920
What do you mean?

06:54.920 --> 06:57.170
Mr. Manchego's
perfectly safe at home.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.460
(phone rings)

06:59.250 --> 07:00.120
Hi, Mom.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.670
Mr. Manchego got out?

07:03.670 --> 07:05.500
This is terrible!

07:07.830 --> 07:10.710
You said something bad
was going to happen to him.

07:10.710 --> 07:14.380
And it did.
How could you possibly
know that?

07:14.380 --> 07:16.710
Well, uh... um...

07:18.120 --> 07:20.960
Bee-cause.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.210
Be-- bee-cause.

07:24.620 --> 07:25.920
That's not an answer.

07:25.920 --> 07:30.670
Uhh... lucky guess?
I-- I gotta go!

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
-(crying)
-I'm sorry.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.380
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry!

07:38.380 --> 07:41.000
I didn't mean
that all marriages
end up like mine!

07:41.000 --> 07:42.750
Hm, I caught the bouquet!

07:42.750 --> 07:43.920
(laughs)

07:48.750 --> 07:51.330
Chels! Chels!

07:51.330 --> 07:53.380
Another passenger
gave me four stars!

07:53.380 --> 07:55.670
Oh, Rae, I'm so
proud of you.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.500
Outta 10, Chels!

07:57.500 --> 07:58.880
Oh. Ohhh.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.540
Ooh, maybe you can go
on the Scut app and give me
a better rating.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.580
Oh, of course,
I'd be happy to.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.210
Oh-- thank you so much,
you're the best, Chels, here.

08:07.210 --> 08:10.210
-Aww! For me?
-Nah, I just gotta
undo my bra.

08:10.210 --> 08:11.080
Ohh.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.920
So... Jared.
I was wondering
if you'd be interested

08:20.920 --> 08:22.500
in becoming
my Peanut Pal.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.790
I just love my face.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.830
You're supposed to be
helping me.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.920
Hey, have you guys seen
Sienna's puppy up here?

08:31.920 --> 08:32.960
Tess and Nia:
There's a puppy?

08:32.960 --> 08:34.210
Oh my gosh,
I'll help you look.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.460
Oh!
There he is!

08:44.580 --> 08:46.250
My vision! Yes!

08:46.250 --> 08:48.420
Now Sienna's definitely
gonna Pal me!

08:48.420 --> 08:49.420
Ha-ha!

08:53.710 --> 08:55.750
I'm back, Mommy!

08:55.750 --> 08:57.790
Mr. Manchego!

08:58.830 --> 09:01.210
Oh my gosh,
thank you so much!

09:02.040 --> 09:03.670
Where'd you find him?

09:03.670 --> 09:05.880
On the roof!
Right where my vision led--

09:06.750 --> 09:10.580
I mean, huh--
right where I, uh,
envisioned

09:10.580 --> 09:11.830
where he might be.

09:11.830 --> 09:16.170
Anyway, now he's home safe,
thanks to your new Pal...

09:16.170 --> 09:18.080
as soon as you Pal me.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.540
Wait... first you told me
he'd get lost,

09:21.540 --> 09:23.420
then you found him.

09:23.420 --> 09:24.380
How?

09:24.380 --> 09:25.790
Uhh...

09:25.790 --> 09:28.920
(gasps)
You wanted to be
my Pal so bad

09:28.920 --> 09:30.250
you stole him!

09:30.250 --> 09:32.790
What?
I didn't steal your dog.

09:32.790 --> 09:37.330
Yeah, right.
Well, not only am I
not Pal-ing you,

09:37.330 --> 09:40.790
but I'm posting to everybody
that you're a puppy stealer.

09:40.790 --> 09:43.540
I didn't--
that's not true.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.500
Then what is the truth?

09:45.500 --> 09:47.880
The truth is, I'm...

09:47.880 --> 09:50.620
Bee-cause.

09:51.330 --> 09:52.420
I'm...

09:53.620 --> 09:55.170
I'm psychic.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.460
(laughs)
Seriously?
You're psychic?

10:00.920 --> 10:04.000
Know what?
Forget it.

10:04.420 --> 10:06.920
Go ahead, tell everybody
that I'm a puppy stealer.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.170
I-- I don't care.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.500
I'm just...
happy your puppy's safe.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.920
Bye, Mr. Manchego.

10:17.210 --> 10:18.540
Booker, wait.

10:20.250 --> 10:24.330
Mr. Manchego just doesn't
give kissie-wissies
to just anybody.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.540
You really did save him.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.540
So I guess that means
you really are psychic.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.170
Thanks for believing me, Sienna.

10:34.170 --> 10:37.210
But we gotta keep this
between us.

10:37.210 --> 10:38.620
You can't tell anybody.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.170
(mimics explosions)

10:45.040 --> 10:46.250
Come on, buddy.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.290
Well...
that should keep a lid on it.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.790
(kids chanting)
Psychic! Psychic!
Psychic! Psychic!

10:55.750 --> 10:56.960
So much for the lid!

10:56.960 --> 10:58.540
(chanting continues)

11:05.120 --> 11:08.540
(kids chanting)
Psychic! Psychic!
Psychic! Psychic!

11:09.460 --> 11:10.710
Booker, what did you do?

11:10.710 --> 11:13.380
Mom told you not to ever
tell anyone about your visions.

11:13.380 --> 11:17.000
I had to!
Sienna accused me
of being a puppy stealer!

11:17.000 --> 11:18.620
She promised she wouldn't
tell anyone.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.790
Did she promise
not to post it?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.620
That she did not do!

11:24.920 --> 11:27.830
Hey, Booker,
if you're really psychic,
predict something.

11:28.250 --> 11:31.580
Haa!
Well, the thing is,
my visions are more

11:31.580 --> 11:33.710
of a once-in-a-while thing.

11:33.710 --> 11:36.330
Ha!
He's not psychic.
Just a big liar.

11:36.330 --> 11:39.040
(kids booing)

11:41.000 --> 11:43.460
Yeah! Whooo!

11:46.960 --> 11:48.170
Wait wait wait wait wait!
No no no!

11:48.170 --> 11:50.080
Come back, I--
I just had a vision!

11:50.080 --> 11:53.000
Booker, don't.
This is your chance
to get out of this.

11:53.290 --> 11:58.170
Any second now,
Coach Spitz is gonna
moonwalk through those doors.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.620
(kids laughing)

11:59.620 --> 12:02.380
Everyone knows
Coach Spitz doesn't allow
moonwalking.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.750
I mean, look at his rules:

12:03.750 --> 12:06.960
no yelling, no gum chewing,
and no moonwalking.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.920
Yes!
Whoo! Whoo!

12:11.670 --> 12:13.540
Whooo!

12:13.540 --> 12:15.420
If their quarterback
pulled his hamstring,

12:15.420 --> 12:17.540
our team's gonna win
Friday's game!

12:19.080 --> 12:22.080
I mean, oh, what a shame...

12:22.080 --> 12:24.670
for that poor... young man.

12:25.670 --> 12:28.040
Make sure you eat
your potassium, kids.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.290
(kids impressed)

12:30.290 --> 12:34.880
This guy's psychic all right.
After class, you've gotta
tell me my future.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.250
-What was that?
-(phone pings)

12:38.250 --> 12:42.380
Ooh-- That was just
the, uh, the sound of me
getting popular again.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.750
You are a sad little psychic.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.080
Ohh-- with a lotta Pals.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.670
(pinging)

12:49.750 --> 12:51.210
Hello...

12:51.210 --> 12:54.790
-Are you my Scut driver?
-Yes, I am.

12:54.790 --> 12:59.250
And I notice that you're going
to 3-5-2 Hauser Ave.
I live there.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.080
-Wow-- Surprise!
-(screams)

13:02.080 --> 13:03.880
(both laughing)

13:03.880 --> 13:06.210
I am surprised...
that someone
with no income

13:06.210 --> 13:08.000
can afford to take a Scut.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.710
A new hat, and new gloves!

13:09.710 --> 13:11.500
What--? Oh, no, Rae,
I'm using your credit card.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.620
Ex-Scut me?

13:12.620 --> 13:14.620
Wha-- I'm doing it
for you, Rae.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.120
I couldn't possibly
give you a good rating

13:17.120 --> 13:18.960
without actually
riding with you first,

13:18.960 --> 13:20.420
you know?
I couldn't live with myself.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.920
You don't, Chels.
You live with me.

13:24.210 --> 13:25.920
(British accent)
Yes, I'm in a bit
of a hurry,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.620
so a little less talky
and more drivey? Hm-hm?

13:29.540 --> 13:30.670
All right.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.670
Oh, uh, I see no hook
for my hat.

13:34.670 --> 13:35.880
Who has a hat hook?

13:35.880 --> 13:37.960
Drivers with more
than four stars.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.420
Here's your hat hook.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.170
Ah! Great.
And no mints I see
as well.

13:45.170 --> 13:47.830
-They're probably
on the floor.
-Oh!

13:47.830 --> 13:49.830
-Next to your hat!
-Oh--!

13:55.040 --> 13:58.170
Sorry, Cosmo,
but the first opening
that Booker has is...

13:58.170 --> 14:00.830
-summer...
-Of next year.

14:00.830 --> 14:03.120
Ha!
Booker books up fast.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.040
But, uh,
here's a head shot.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.210
Oh!
And don't forget
to Pal me!

14:09.120 --> 14:11.250
Check it out.
Even Jared's waiting

14:11.250 --> 14:13.330
to get a psychic reading
from Booker.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.040
Yeah.
And I can't even get him
to Pal me.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.750
That's it.
I'm gonna go over there
and put him in a headlock.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.620
Nia, you don't need
to go over there.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.120
My mind is made up, Tess.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.040
No, I mean he's...

14:24.920 --> 14:26.290
(gasps)
Jared!

14:26.290 --> 14:28.500
I mean... hey, Jared.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.210
Hey.
I accepted your Pal request.

14:31.210 --> 14:32.790
You did? When?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.170
Now.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.420
(phone pings)

14:36.420 --> 14:38.750
-Ahhh...
-Steady girl.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.750
So, Nia, I really need to know

14:41.750 --> 14:43.670
how I'm gonna do
in the big game
this weekend.

14:43.670 --> 14:45.250
Any chance you could
talk to your brother

14:45.250 --> 14:46.790
and get me moved up
on his list?

14:47.580 --> 14:48.920
I'll see what I can do.

14:51.210 --> 14:54.880
Hey, Levi, check it out.
I'm up to 400 Pals.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.380
Ooh.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.830
Booker!
You need to predict
Jared's future.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.380
(laughs)

15:01.380 --> 15:04.000
Well, well, well.
(laughs)

15:04.000 --> 15:05.250
Look who's climbin'
off her high horse,

15:05.250 --> 15:08.460
and hoppin' on
the sad little psychic's train
to Pal Town.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.
All aboard, choo-choo!

15:11.000 --> 15:14.120
Sorry, Nia,
but I'm not actually
doin' predictions.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.880
I'm just makin' appointments
and makin' 'em wait.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.420
Good.
Then you'll have plenty of time
to make something up for him.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.960
Jared?
You're in!

15:21.960 --> 15:26.420
Thanks, guys!
So, Booker, what I really
need to know

15:26.420 --> 15:28.080
is how I'll do
in Friday's game, heh.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.620
Our school's depending on me.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.380
Do it for the school, Booker.

15:32.380 --> 15:35.620
The school...
really likes him.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.000
Okay.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.790
All right...
(clears throat)

15:41.790 --> 15:44.460
Friday's game...
(clears throat)

15:44.460 --> 15:48.170
Friday's game...

15:48.710 --> 15:50.710
(gasps)
I just saw that you're
gonna be

15:50.710 --> 15:52.080
the game's big hero!

15:52.080 --> 15:53.540
-You hear that?
-Cool!

15:53.540 --> 15:56.540
Do you see any special
preparations I have to do,

15:56.540 --> 15:58.380
like, anything I have to eat?

15:58.380 --> 16:01.040
-Uhh--
-Jared. Nia. Booker.
Ben. Anna.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.670
-Ben-Anna.
-Banana?

16:03.670 --> 16:07.380
Banana.
Yes. I-- I--
I see-- I see

16:07.380 --> 16:09.120
lots and lots of bananas.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.500
Why bananas?

16:10.500 --> 16:12.790
Potassium.
Like the coach said,

16:12.790 --> 16:14.750
so you don't pull your hammy
like the other quarterback.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.830
Oh! Got it!

16:16.830 --> 16:17.920
Thanks, Booker.

16:18.330 --> 16:19.250
Thanks, Nia.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.790
Bye, Pal.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.000
Nice save
with the banana, Booker.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.710
Yeah, it's a good thing
Ben and Anna were standin'
next to us,

16:26.710 --> 16:28.330
instead of Tuna
and Casserole.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.170
I'm on Jared's page.

16:34.170 --> 16:38.040
It's like looking around
at a museum of... Jared.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.580
Look how many trophies he has.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.580
Look how many cats he has.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.920
Ooh, and uh, look
at all my Pals.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.620
Do you think
he's sitting on his couch
right now

16:49.620 --> 16:51.330
looking at my page?

16:51.330 --> 16:54.880
Uh, no, there's no room
on his couch, 'cause look
at all those cats!

16:55.380 --> 16:56.290
(phone pings)

16:56.290 --> 16:58.500
Oh, we've got a problem.

16:58.500 --> 17:02.120
Since you gave Jared
his vision, nobody
wants to wait.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.750
They want their visions now.

17:03.750 --> 17:07.460
What?
I could barely come up
with one for Jared.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.380
How am I supposed
to do that?

17:17.580 --> 17:19.330
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

17:19.330 --> 17:22.120
No.
But it's gonna be fun
to watch.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.790
The Psychic Peanut
is ready!

17:28.120 --> 17:30.290
Okay, first up, Sienna.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.830
All righty.

17:33.830 --> 17:34.620
(clears throat)

17:35.380 --> 17:38.000
(singing)
I'm having a vision...

17:39.540 --> 17:41.420
I'm seeing...

17:42.330 --> 17:43.880
I'm seeing...

17:45.750 --> 17:47.540
What am I seeing?

17:47.540 --> 17:51.380
According to Sienna's
Peanut Face profile,
she likes avocado toast.

17:51.380 --> 17:52.750
(gasps)

17:53.460 --> 17:56.380
For lunch, you're going
to have avocado toes.

17:56.380 --> 17:57.380
Toast, not toes!

17:57.380 --> 17:59.460
Toast!
Not toes!

18:01.250 --> 18:03.250
I do have avocado toast!

18:04.790 --> 18:06.500
And avocado toes!

18:07.250 --> 18:08.790
You got them both right!

18:08.790 --> 18:11.420
Thanks, Booker.
He's the best psychic ever.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.540
Yes, yes, yes...

18:12.540 --> 18:13.670
All right, bye.

18:13.670 --> 18:17.460
Psychic, huh?
What's he tryin' to pull?

18:20.080 --> 18:23.420
Ooh, fresh mints,
chilled water...

18:23.420 --> 18:25.960
and a real hat hook!

18:26.460 --> 18:28.620
Wow, Rae, I think eight stars
is appropriate here.

18:28.620 --> 18:31.790
Aah! Wait till you get your,
uh, "thanks for Scutin'
with me" gift.

18:31.790 --> 18:34.210
Oh my gosh!
Oh, I hope it's cheese!

18:34.210 --> 18:36.420
(phone rings)

18:37.420 --> 18:38.460
Hi, Coach Spitz.

18:38.460 --> 18:39.710
Did you know your son

18:39.710 --> 18:42.040
is tellin' the whole school
he's psychic?

18:42.040 --> 18:43.620
What?
Hold on, please.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.080
Chels, water?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.500
Your window's closed.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.580
Hey, Jared.
I see you're following
my brother's psychic advice.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.330
Thanks to you.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.920
Wow, that's a lot
of bananas.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.380
Care to join me?

19:09.380 --> 19:11.830
Potassi...yum.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.080
Just a little banana humor.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

19:18.670 --> 19:19.710
Hey, Booker!

19:19.710 --> 19:22.380
-Breakfast of her--oes!
-(thud)

19:22.380 --> 19:24.000
-Oh!
-Ohmigod!

19:24.000 --> 19:25.420
Jared, are you okay?

19:25.420 --> 19:28.330
I think I pulled my hammy!
I don't think I can play!

19:28.330 --> 19:29.880
You said he'd win the game.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.830
You're a fake psychic.
Fake psychic boy.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.920
(chanting)
Fake psychic!
Fake psychic!

19:35.920 --> 19:37.250
Everyone, stop!

19:38.960 --> 19:41.920
My brother is not a fake.
He was just trying to help me
with Jared,

19:41.920 --> 19:43.080
my new Pal.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.880
I never really wanted
to be your Pal anyways.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.830
I only did it so I could
move up your brother's list.

19:48.830 --> 19:52.580
-What?
-Hey, you're lucky
you're Pals with my sister.

19:52.580 --> 19:55.620
-(chuckles)
Were... Pals.
-(whoosh)

19:57.250 --> 19:58.250
Ha-ha...

19:59.210 --> 20:01.710
Huh-- Well, that sure
put a lid on it.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.170
Boy:
Get 'em!

20:03.170 --> 20:05.250
(kids yelling)

20:05.580 --> 20:08.040
Maybe I did misunderstand,
Ms. Baxter.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.670
They were probably
sayin' "sidekick",
not "psychic."

20:10.670 --> 20:13.250
Exactly.
My son doesn't have to lie
about being psychic

20:13.250 --> 20:14.380
to be popular.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.420
Everybody wants a piece of him.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.460
Sienna:
Get the fake psychic!

20:24.210 --> 20:25.710
In fact, I want
a piece of him myself!

20:25.710 --> 20:26.580
Uh-huh.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.210
Oh!

20:35.210 --> 20:37.710
I can't believe
we're being chased
by an angry mob!

20:37.710 --> 20:38.920
(pounding on door)

20:38.920 --> 20:39.710
Ooh!

20:41.330 --> 20:43.540
It's not an angry mob,
it's an angry Mom!

20:43.540 --> 20:45.000
That's worse!

20:45.000 --> 20:46.580
(pounding on door)

20:46.580 --> 20:48.120
Okay, why wouldn't
she be using her key?

20:49.120 --> 20:52.170
(gasps)
She's sharpening it!

20:52.170 --> 20:53.920
-Okay, okay...
-Okay.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.620
Family meeting, now.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.710
But you just got home,
don't you wanna take
your bra off?

20:59.710 --> 21:01.120
Sit!

21:04.420 --> 21:09.000
Now, Booker, I distinctly
told you not to tell anybody
you were psychic,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.620
and you went
and did it anyway, why?

21:11.920 --> 21:13.540
Because.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.790
Because?
Oooooh!

21:17.540 --> 21:19.250
That is not an answer!

21:19.750 --> 21:22.330
But... it was
when I asked you.

21:22.330 --> 21:24.960
(gasps)
When you-- Ohhh!
When you--!

21:24.960 --> 21:28.710
Ohhh!
My oooooh!

21:28.710 --> 21:31.830
When I--?
Boyyyy!

21:31.830 --> 21:33.790
I tried to tell him.

21:33.790 --> 21:36.880
Oh, was that
before or after you used
my psychic abilities

21:36.880 --> 21:38.330
to get Jared
to notice you?

21:38.330 --> 21:41.420
(gasps)
Oh, there's a whole bunch
of whoo's comin'

21:41.420 --> 21:42.290
for you too, girl!

21:44.500 --> 21:47.920
Mom, you just don't understand
what it's like to be a kid
nowadays.

21:48.750 --> 21:52.040
I mean, everybody's postin'
about how cool their life is.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.750
I just want everyone
to think that I'm cool, too,

21:53.750 --> 21:55.960
and then they'll wanna
be my friends.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.210
Oh, sweetheart,
you are so cool.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.080
But not because
you have visions.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.830
Right?
You're cool because
you're sweet,

22:03.830 --> 22:06.620
you're smart,
you're funny,
you're loyal...

22:06.620 --> 22:10.620
why don't you post that,
and whoever pings you,
that's your real friend.

22:12.290 --> 22:16.580
Wow. I-- I guess
I really never thought
about it that way.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.960
You were right, Mom.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.250
I-- I should've listened
to you and just been happy
with "because."

22:22.250 --> 22:26.710
No.
Actually, no, that's,
um... you deserve

22:26.710 --> 22:28.670
a better answer
than "because."

22:28.670 --> 22:32.830
You asked me a question,
and I gave you the same answer
that my parents gave me.

22:32.830 --> 22:35.620
And you know what?
I didn't like it, either.

22:36.290 --> 22:37.500
So ask me again.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.460
Why can't I tell people
that I'm psychic?

22:41.460 --> 22:44.500
You can.
As long as you
trust them.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.000
Like I trust Chelsea,
and your Dad.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.170
Okay?

22:49.170 --> 22:50.790
Yeah.

22:50.790 --> 22:51.830
Thanks, Mom.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.500
Come here!
Oh, I love you guys
so bad!

22:56.380 --> 22:57.710
I love you.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.790
Well... you learned
an important lesson
here, Booker.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.710
-Well, goodnight.
-Sit down!

23:05.750 --> 23:07.670
And give me your phones
for a week.

23:07.670 --> 23:08.960
-A week?
-Why?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.540
Be... quiet!

23:16.920 --> 23:19.210
Okay, I am really
counting on you
to give me 10 stars,

23:19.210 --> 23:20.920
so if there's
anything I can do

23:20.920 --> 23:23.290
to make your Scut ride
more enjoyable, let me know.

23:23.290 --> 23:25.040
There's water, mints--

23:25.040 --> 23:26.750
How about gettin' a bigger car?
