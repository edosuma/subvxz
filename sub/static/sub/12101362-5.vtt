I want you both out of my house.

Unless you can pay back
the loan,

your house anymore.

MICHAEL:
Deputy Commissioner Dawkins.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.467
I have found evidence
of a gambling ring.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.469
If you say anything about this,
multiple players

00:11.511 --> 00:13.680
will testify that you
are the ringleader.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.141
My father left me
the mineral rights

00:16.182 --> 00:18.101
to the entire
manor property.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.311
I will be taking over
as head of the dynasty.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.480
You're my mom. I don't
want to lose you.

then I'll just leave the church.

When I come back,
you can bet

00:31.740 --> 00:33.783
Is Fallon going to be a problem?

00:33.825 --> 00:36.578
I'm concerned about
this whole access roads ploy.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.288
Unconcern yourself.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.623
She only bought the land to hold
it over my head as a threat.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.167
Well, it's working.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.044
She can stop excavation
whenever she wants,

00:44.085 --> 00:46.296
and we haven't even started.
(phone ringing)

00:46.337 --> 00:48.006
It's my mother.
I'll call her back.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.091
The point is, even
though the foreman says

00:50.133 --> 00:52.010
we're good to go,
if she doesn't allow

00:52.052 --> 00:53.386
the workmen on the ground...

00:53.428 --> 00:54.763
I said it won't be a problem.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.639
We just need to keep her happy.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.725
Your plan is to stuff
her with bacon?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.518
We're in trouble.
Quick question.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.812
How long do you think
this partnership's gonna last

01:02.854 --> 01:04.314
before one of you
kills the other?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.316
Hmm.
Hmm? Ooh.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.109
Bacon.
Ah-ah-ah.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.319
But there's, like,
a hundred pieces.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.320
And none of them are for you.

01:10.361 --> 01:10.987
(whimpers softly)

ADAM:
Aha, the self-appointed
head of the family.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.535
I saw it on TV,
so it must be true.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.579
Well, someone had to step up
and save this dynasty,

01:19.621 --> 01:21.039
and it wasn't gonna be
anyone in this room.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.707
Well, she has
the arrogance for the job.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.084
Maybe not the skill set.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.794
You can relax.
It was just something

01:25.835 --> 01:27.587
I said for the public.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.673
Now the world has confidence
that the family isn't crumbling.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.884
My statement won't have
any effect on you.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.219
I have bigger things
to worry about.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.596
Sweetheart,
I made your favorite.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.515
Eat. It helps with anxiety.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.683
I am not anxious. I am focused.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.436
In three days, I have my first
State of the Company Address

01:43.478 --> 01:46.022
where I will announce
a buyout of SmartVerse.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.482
And we care about this why?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.484
SmartVerse will make me
a global player

01:49.526 --> 01:51.611
in the digital market,
which I have to be

01:51.653 --> 01:53.613
if I am going to turn
Fallon Unlimited

01:53.655 --> 01:55.949
into the crown jewel
that C.A. once was.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.992
So you are head of the family?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.702
Yes, and this is my one shot

01:59.744 --> 02:01.913
at a first impression
in this role.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.873
Needless to say,
I don't have time

02:03.915 --> 02:05.041
to worry about
any of you.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.167
And I also don't have time

02:06.209 --> 02:07.794
to worry about access roads,

02:07.836 --> 02:09.462
so you can start
digging whenever.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.090
See? I told you I'd handle it.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.758
See? You didn't do anything.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.511
So I guess this bacon's
up for grabs?

Let's not pretend
to like each other.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.472

02:19.514 --> 02:21.015
I know you have some players
in your pocket,

02:21.057 --> 02:22.475
but I can't have you
hanging this betting scheme

02:22.517 --> 02:24.477
over my head as blackmail.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.146
Well, I don't know
what you're referring to,

02:26.187 --> 02:28.773
but as long as you
keep your mouth shut,

02:28.815 --> 02:30.567
we're not gonna
have any problems.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.986
I want to sell the team.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.404
I'd highly recommend that.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.198
I didn't ask you
here for advice.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.034
I want a local buyer so the team
stays here in Atlanta.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.452
I know a handful
of Black businessmen

02:41.494 --> 02:43.121
who might be interested.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.165
I think it's important
to keep it Black-owned.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.542
Well, brother,
I appreciate your input.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.335
Especially since
I have to approve any buyer

02:49.377 --> 02:51.421
before it goes
to the owners for a vote.

02:51.462 --> 02:55.550
But I, um... Well, I also
happen to have a few friends

02:55.592 --> 02:57.468
who are interested
in buying a franchise.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.095
Who? The old white guys

02:59.137 --> 03:00.305
at the country club
that harass the cart girls?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.348
(laughs)
So, what?

03:02.390 --> 03:04.767
You do a favor for them,
they do one for you?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.769
Hey, I resent that.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.271
But, look, if you sell
to one of those guys,

03:08.313 --> 03:09.772
we could fast-track the approval

03:09.814 --> 03:11.441
and we can wrap this thing up
nice and quick.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.151
And what about what I want?

03:13.193 --> 03:15.695
I mean, I'm sure we'll cast
a wide net for a buyer.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.989
(laughs softly)
But ultimately it's...

03:18.031 --> 03:20.783
what's best for me
and the league.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.288
We can make the announcement
at the playoff press conference.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.748
Oh.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.917
Now, you turn that frown
upside down,

03:28.958 --> 03:30.752
because you are
one handshake away

03:30.793 --> 03:33.338
from becoming Atlanta's
newest multimillionaire.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.006
Get out.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.179
JEFF:
I think selling is a good idea.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.014
Yeah, well, it feels
more like selling out.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.017
This league has
one Black owner. Me.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.644
The last thing I want
is to let Dawkins

03:47.685 --> 03:49.646
sell it to one
of his sailing buddies.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.439
I hear you,
but the longer you stay there,

03:51.481 --> 03:53.441
the more you put
your reputation at risk.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.944
When is the last time
Jeff Colby ran from a fight?

03:55.985 --> 03:58.696
(chuckles): Hey, man,
I'm just trying to protect you.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.365
But if you want to fight, fight.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.450
I want to take this guy down,

04:02.492 --> 04:05.245
but he is airtight
with this gambling ring.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.500
Well, one thing
I learned as an owner

04:10.541 --> 04:12.543
is that Dawkins is
all about the money.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.922
That guy will sell to whoever
gives him the biggest kickback.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.799
You just have to make sure
you can prove that.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.052
So I have to find someone rich
enough to afford a soccer team

04:21.094 --> 04:23.346
and crazy enough
to bribe someone.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.889
Yes.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.225
And no, it can't be me.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.601
(laughs)

04:30.061 --> 04:32.188
Has SmartVerse called?

04:32.230 --> 04:35.942
I can't close the deal
if we don't have a meeting set.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.151
(knocking on door)

04:37.193 --> 04:38.361
Aw.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.822
Anders. How's life
at La Mirage?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.032
Still sleeping on a rollaway
in Blake's room?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.743
My sleeping arrangements
are none of your business.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.247
This, however, is your business.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.791
Oh, Anders.
Don't tell me you're selling

04:51.833 --> 04:53.835
leather appointment books
for money.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.379
(gasps) My, how
the not-so-mighty have fallen.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.756
That is the Carrington
family calendar.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.842
In it you'll find a series
of scheduled events

05:00.883 --> 05:02.385
that need
your attention.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.053
Okay, well, right now
I'm having a hard time

05:04.095 --> 05:05.888
paying attention to you,
so could you get to the point?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.266
They're in-person obligations
that Blake used to do

05:08.308 --> 05:10.059
that he's now bequeathed to you.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.187
If you care about the Carrington
family legacy's health, that is.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.190
Well, Blake's legs aren't
broken-- not anymore at least--

05:16.232 --> 05:19.235
so maybe he should focus
on the leather book stuff

05:19.277 --> 05:21.029
and I should focus
on the business stuff,

05:21.070 --> 05:23.072
because if this presentation
doesn't go well,

05:23.114 --> 05:25.700
there won't be a Carrington
legacy to keep healthy.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.161
When you announced to the world
through national television

05:28.202 --> 05:30.038
that you were the head
of the family,

05:30.079 --> 05:33.333
Blake assumed that you would act
like the head of the family.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.294
That interview is really
biting me in the ass today.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.879
I could always reach out
to Adam, I suppose.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.756
Split the family
obligation

05:39.797 --> 05:41.299
between the two of you,
but Blake

05:41.341 --> 05:42.550
never had to do that.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.010
No, no, no.
No need to do that.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.345
The last thing we need right now

05:45.386 --> 05:47.305
is Adam out there
representing the family.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.932
I can do both.
If Blake did it, so can I.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.643
Your first commitment.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.438
A library dedication?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.315
Do libraries still exist?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.733
That's a question
you can ask the librarian

05:58.775 --> 06:00.068
when you get there.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.487
Fine. You can tell Blake
not to worry.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.322
This family's not dying
on my watch.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.282
He'll be ecstatic.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.283
Okay.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.409
(gasps)
Ooh.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.453

06:10.495 --> 06:12.997
Would you happen
to have a backup

Carrington legacy
appointment book?

06:17.668 --> 06:18.795
It's now your time

06:18.836 --> 06:21.756
to put the "care" in Carrington.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.051
Please never say that again.

Have you tried
the hash browns here yet?

Well, she balked at first,
but as you predicted,

06:57.250 --> 06:59.877
she folded as soon
as I mentioned Adam's name.

Mm, yeah, the fact that
we're living in a hotel

07:09.679 --> 07:11.180
rather than a
sprawling mansion.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.182

07:18.688 --> 07:19.981
No need to.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.649
I happen to know
that the good Father

07:21.691 --> 07:23.317
still hasn't left
his job.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.278
We simply need to make it
impossible for him to do so

by reminding him
how much he means to the clergy.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.658
Are you sure he's considering
staying with the church?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.369
Of course I'm not
staying at the church.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.121
Nothing's changed.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.166
It's just, once I told Blake
I was leaving--

07:38.207 --> 07:39.584
I don't know.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.794
I thought you and I
were on the same page.

W-We are. It's just I...

08:40.186 --> 08:41.687
No, but he said
the Carringtons used to be

08:41.729 --> 08:44.440
a really powerful family,
but it all fell apart

08:44.482 --> 08:46.526
and that you should be
embarrassed to show your face.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.611
(laughs)
Well, is your daddy here?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.238
I'd love to have
a little chat with him.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.864
No.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.075
So, Carrington Atlantic
didn't go bankrupt?

08:54.116 --> 08:56.661
Uh, no, it, uh, it did.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.287
I'm just wondering
how you know that.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.498
Shouldn't you be home,
watching Blue's Clues?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.124
It was all over the news,
how your mom

09:02.166 --> 09:03.626
screwed over
your dad for that house.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.920
Okay, well, that had
nothing to do with me.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.964
What about those
dead bodies in the lake?

09:08.005 --> 09:08.965
Did you kill one of them?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.883
Okay. Listen, Tommy,

09:10.925 --> 09:13.344
which is a really, really dumb
name, by the way,

09:13.386 --> 09:16.097
if you don't stop making
baseless accusations against me,

09:16.138 --> 09:18.015
I'm gonna sue you, I'm
gonna sue your father,

09:18.057 --> 09:19.100
and I'm gonna take your dog.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.560
All right? So...

09:20.601 --> 09:22.478
There you go. Not laughing now.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.021
Little loser.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.357
(indistinct chatter)

09:26.399 --> 09:29.151
Should we take
those pictures now?

09:29.193 --> 09:31.529
MICHAEL:
You're looking to buy
the Atlantix Football Club,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.447
you'll do whatever it takes
to get the deal.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.576
If that includes a finder's fee
for Mr. Dawkins,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.369
that's no problem.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.454
Once he accepts,
that'll be our smoking gun.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.498
Just make sure
your phone's recording.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.086
So, what's my backstory?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.296
Your what?

09:49.297 --> 09:50.464
My backstory?

09:50.506 --> 09:52.174
Have I loved soccer
all my life,

09:52.216 --> 09:53.926
or is this a new passion?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.511
I mean, it doesn't seem like
I'm doing this for the money.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.555
It seems more like a
"for the love of the game"

09:57.597 --> 09:58.889
type of situation.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.766
Please don't make me
regret doing this

10:00.808 --> 10:02.143
more than I already do.
(scoffs)

10:02.184 --> 10:03.477
Okay.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.355
So maybe you say

10:06.397 --> 10:11.611
you played as a kid in Venezuela
and tried for the national team.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.237
(laughs softly)

10:13.279 --> 10:15.031
It's a backstory,
not a fairy tale.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.616
No, this meeting is tonight.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.284
You don't need a backstory.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.620
You're you. Sam.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.246
A rich hotelier

10:22.288 --> 10:23.998
looking to buy
a soccer club

10:24.040 --> 10:26.500
at a higher price
than any of the competition.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.629
Yeah. I'll think of something.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.882
(sighs) You will not believe
what just happened.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.009
From what I read online, you
threatened to sue a child

10:35.051 --> 10:37.470
and steal his dog,
and you hate books.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.764
I do not
hate books, Allison.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.099
I'm sorry.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.684
I keep forgetting
that you're not her.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.436
I have to be honest,
it would be so much easier

10:45.478 --> 10:46.896
if your name were also Allison.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.273
But it's not. It's, uh...

10:49.315 --> 10:50.691
Martina.
(mouths)

10:50.733 --> 10:52.276
Allison quit over
two weeks ago.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.153
You can call me by
my real name now.
Mm.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.821
Anyway, it's all
over the Internet.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.199
Wow, must be a slow news day.
At least it's over.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.825
Let's get to work.
One problem.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.243
SmartVerse called and canceled

11:01.285 --> 11:02.536
the meeting while you
were on your way up.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.122
I got them back
on the line.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.500
Please hold for
Fallon Carrington.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.504
Cathy.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.506
Yes, I can explain.

11:13.547 --> 11:17.510
No, no, no, no, no.
I think our values do line up.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.221
No, I don't hate anything.
(chuckles)

11:20.262 --> 11:23.641
Cathy? Cathy, you can't just
cut off negotiations like that.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.184
No, no, no, don't...

11:26.977 --> 11:28.521
They cut off negotiations.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.065
(sighs)

11:31.107 --> 11:32.942
Okay, listen, um...

11:33.984 --> 11:35.528
...Martina.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.571
Uh, get all
the department heads together.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.365
Okay? And have them
start brainstorming,

11:39.407 --> 11:41.909
since I just lost the
centerpiece to my presentation.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.994
And we cannot let
this PR thing snowball,

11:44.036 --> 11:46.288
so get the leather book
and make sure I do not

11:46.330 --> 11:48.082
miss one more appointment,
because if I do,

11:48.124 --> 11:50.209
I will not be able
to show my face in public,

11:50.251 --> 11:52.670
and worse, Tommy will be right.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.423
So you're doing all of this
just to spite a child?

11:55.464 --> 11:58.634
No, no,
not just to spite a child.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.928
But it's definitely
an added bonus.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.680
So I'm just
supposed to give

12:02.722 --> 12:04.390
part of
my diamond shares to you?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.976
I think it's only fair, given
that I convinced Fallon.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.853
You didn't convince Fallon.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.854
(knocking on door)

12:09.895 --> 12:11.188
One minute!

12:11.230 --> 12:13.691
You have nothing
without my mineral rights.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.359
Things have
changed, Dominique.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.278
Financing the dig
is expensive.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.530
It's only fair
when you stop to think about it.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.240
You should be thrilled
with 60/40.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.658
(knocking on door)
Come in!

12:22.700 --> 12:24.493
I'm not giving you 60/40,
and if you think...

12:24.535 --> 12:26.996
Mom, can I speak to you?

12:27.037 --> 12:28.539
Mom!
One second.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.374
Your ex-wife is extorting me.
You know the feeling.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.793
Yeah, Mama, I really need
to speak to you.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.880
If anyone is being
extorted here, it's me.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.631
JEFF:
Dom!

12:37.673 --> 12:39.133
Your mother passed away.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.345
Grandma Lo.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.930
She's gone.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.475
Jeff, I'm so sorry.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.812
How can that be?
She just called me this morning.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.564
Well, how did she sound?

12:56.609 --> 12:57.693
(door closes)

12:57.735 --> 12:58.944
I didn't take the call.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.157
I was going to call her later.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.827
Well, apparently, she went down
for her afternoon nap

13:06.869 --> 13:07.912
and just passed.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.747
They said
it was peaceful.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.249
I'll take care of her things
and the funeral arrangements.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.667
Just wanted to let you know.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.877
No.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.631
I-I'll take care
of the arrangements.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.342
Are we clear?

13:21.383 --> 13:23.052
Sure.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.971
Whatever you want.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.855
I would have loved to play
for the national team,

13:34.897 --> 13:36.357
but it just
didn't work out.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.608
Oh, yeah? Injuries?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.903
Well, more lack of talent
when I turned ten.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.655
(both chuckle)

13:42.696 --> 13:43.906
(phone vibrating)
Oh, sorry.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.699
Let me shut this off.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.287
So, let's talk Atlantix.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.874
Well, (clears throat)
to be fully transparent,

13:53.916 --> 13:57.378
I, uh, already have
a few offers.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.171
What I need to know
is what I can do

13:59.213 --> 14:00.589
to make my offer
stand out.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.259
Well, it's hard to say.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.219
I mean, with multiple
interested parties,

14:05.261 --> 14:07.263
it's going to be very expensive.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.515
And sports teams aren't always
solid investments.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.768
I'm not doing this
for the money.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.812
So maybe we can
work together on this,

14:14.854 --> 14:18.232
figure out
a fair deal for everyone.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.405
You know, I think
that you and I could

14:24.446 --> 14:27.283
come to an agreement that'll
be mutually beneficial.

14:27.324 --> 14:30.494
Because I'm not in it
for the money either.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.584
Why don't you set up a
suite for us on Friday.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.294
We can discuss details then.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.421
Sure.
Good.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.514
So, did you get anything?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.892
I'm pretty sure
he'll let me have the team

14:52.933 --> 14:55.019
if I sleep with him.
Really?

14:56.353 --> 14:57.771
Well, I'm not
letting you do that.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.106
(scoffs)

14:59.148 --> 15:00.482
You know I wasn't
actually offering

15:00.524 --> 15:01.859
to sleep with him, right?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.653
Oh.
Oh.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.739
Fallon?
What are you doing here?

15:06.780 --> 15:08.532
Shouldn't you be
crown jeweling somewhere?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.659
I'm running this family and
I need you to explain to me

15:10.701 --> 15:13.621
what the Carrington Medical
Research Institute is.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.539
You're here for the MRI?
The what?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.291
MRI--
Medical Research Institute.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.960
(sighs) Seriously? Doesn't
that get confusing?

15:20.002 --> 15:21.670
Look, why don't you let
the white coat people

15:21.712 --> 15:22.922
do the white coat stuff.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.214
Listen, I don't want to be here.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.633
In fact, I have to redo

15:25.674 --> 15:27.676
my entire presentation
in a single day,

15:27.718 --> 15:29.345
but I can't afford
to hate books,

15:29.386 --> 15:30.763
children and health care

15:30.804 --> 15:33.182
all in the same week.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.392
Okay, so the institute
works out of the hospital.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.603
We have five medical researchers
all presenting projects.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.229
The best idea
gets the grant money,

15:39.271 --> 15:40.981
and they get to work
at the Carrington MRI.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.274
Okay, yeah, yeah, that's enough.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.068
This way.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.365
Thoughts.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.866
Ideas.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.493
They come to us

15:52.534 --> 15:55.037
at the most random of
times, and when they do,

15:55.079 --> 15:57.247
it's...

15:57.289 --> 15:58.999
(thunder cracks)

15:59.041 --> 16:00.918
...electric.
(bell dings)

16:00.960 --> 16:02.962
But don't worry,
when it comes to science,

16:03.003 --> 16:05.422
lightning strikes
more than once.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.257
(chuckles)

16:07.299 --> 16:10.469
Now, I wanted to be a medical
researcher since I was ten,

16:10.511 --> 16:12.513
so we'll start there.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.976
JENNINGS:
You threatened
to hurt a priest?

16:17.017 --> 16:18.686
Doesn't sound like
something I would do.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.021
Caleb told me everything,
how you went to the church

16:21.063 --> 16:22.564
and tried to scare him.
No.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.650
This is all
a big misunderstanding.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.694
I would never threaten him,
and, God, I certainly

16:26.735 --> 16:28.862
didn't think he would come
running to tell you about it.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.489
I'm not sure

16:30.531 --> 16:32.616
that's the
point, Blake.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.202
Sometimes I don't even
recognize you anymore.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.081
You know, I hardly
recognize myself these days.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.251
I'm living alone in a hotel.
I have no business.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.669
The woman I'm madly in love with

16:43.711 --> 16:45.421
wants to leave me.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.423
Should I have gone to that
church and confronted Caleb?

16:47.464 --> 16:48.799
No, probably not.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.592
But desperate times
make for desperate men.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.302
I'm sorry for what I did,

16:52.344 --> 16:54.346
but I am not sorry for wanting
to still be with you.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.473
And if you really
look at me,

16:56.515 --> 16:59.810
you will recognize the same man
that you fell in love with.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.776
I appreciate what you're saying,
but it doesn't make it okay.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.612
The last thing
that I want to do is hurt you.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.114
I'm sorry.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.949
I understand.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.410
But I'm not the one

17:16.452 --> 17:17.995
you should be
apologizing to.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.122
(sighs)

17:20.164 --> 17:23.000
Which brings me to...

17:23.042 --> 17:24.376
the crux.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.879
Now, some would
call this research,

17:26.920 --> 17:29.006
but I call it...

17:29.048 --> 17:30.507
"the cure."

17:32.176 --> 17:33.510
Wow!

17:34.511 --> 17:35.471
He's not done yet.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.973
He's done now. (gasps)

17:38.015 --> 17:40.893
So many great ideas in there.
I love a good cure.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.144
But, you know,
I was thinking:

17:42.186 --> 17:43.854
Who are we to tell you guys

17:43.896 --> 17:46.065
that one of your projects
is better than the other?

17:46.106 --> 17:48.317
That's actually why we're here.
I mean, can you really put

17:48.358 --> 17:50.402
a price tag on saving lives?
What are you talking about?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.739
I have decided
to grant all five of you

17:53.781 --> 17:55.032
the necessary funding.
(gasps)

17:55.074 --> 17:56.992
That's right. Yep. Even you,

17:57.034 --> 17:58.952
creepy, greasy guy
in the corner over there.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.454
What are you doing?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.122
Remember, Fallon Carrington

18:02.164 --> 18:05.292
is all about
people, health and books.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.627
Meeting adjourned.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.961
What?

18:08.003 --> 18:09.379
I'm just letting
the white coat people

18:09.421 --> 18:11.423
handle the white coat stuff.
Got to go.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.761
Yes, that would be nice. We can
put the lilies with those.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.764
Great.
Uh, I know she was your mother,

18:18.806 --> 18:20.390
but she hated lilies.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.892
The smell gave her a headache.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.352
She didn't like
most of the things

18:23.393 --> 18:25.020
you're planning
right now.
I'm sorry.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.065
I'm going to have
to call you back.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.275
This isn't a competition, son.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.570
No, it's not, 'cause if it was,
you would lose.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.697
I grew up
in the same house with her.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.199
I knew her well enough.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.700
Yeah, not like Monica and I did.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.536
She raised us
because you weren't there.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.329
So I'm not gonna let you
give her a funeral

18:42.371 --> 18:43.664
that she would have hated.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.583
You're not going to let me?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.961
You are being so selfish.

18:49.002 --> 18:52.297
This is my mother we
are talking about.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.423
(scoffs)

18:53.465 --> 18:55.509
Maybe you should leave.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.469
What?
You heard me.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.515
If you can't respect me or
my wishes, then get out.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.358
(horns honking, siren wailing)

19:11.400 --> 19:12.943
FALLON:
No, we're not moving.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.445
And this guy isn't taking
any of my suggestions.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.281
He won't even change lanes.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.158
The department heads are here
waiting, I have briefed them

19:19.199 --> 19:21.326
on the situation, and we have
some ideas to share with you.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.163
And...
Martina? Martina?

19:24.204 --> 19:25.372
Are you frozen?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.791
Please stop making that face.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.210
Hi. Maybe you can
make a left here?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.295
And we will.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.422
You know what? Uh, I am stuck.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.049
So why don't you tell everybody
to just leave their reports

19:36.091 --> 19:38.468
and we'll reconvene
in the morning, all right?

19:40.220 --> 19:41.805
Hmm?
Get out.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.764
I'm driving.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.433
Out.
(groans)

19:50.522 --> 19:51.815
CALEB:
Thanks for coming. Thank you.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.400
Have a great day. Thank you.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.860
Oh, goodbye, Mrs. Walters.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.321
Good to see you. Take care.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.949
Excellent sermon, Father.
Really made me think.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.743
What are you doing here, Blake?

20:02.784 --> 20:04.369
Uh...
Bye.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.164
Never too late for
a little forgiveness, I hope.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.624
Yeah, I'll put in a good word.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.417
I'm apologizing
to you.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.835
I never should have
threatened you.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.420
I hope you didn't think
I was serious.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.256
Look, all I know
is that you're probably here

20:16.298 --> 20:18.467
because Cristal told you
to come.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.052
But you're not
welcome in my church.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.762
Not even these steps.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.557
Well, that's not very generous
of a man of the cloth.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.643
Does this mean
you're not accepting my apology?

20:27.684 --> 20:30.938
As God is my witness,
literally, I will throw you

20:30.979 --> 20:33.398
off these grounds
unless you leave now.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.151
JEREMY:
Uh, sorry to
interrupt, Father,

20:36.193 --> 20:38.195
But I really need
someone to talk to.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.948
I've been having some problems
with my, uh, drinking,

20:40.989 --> 20:42.824
and-and I'm-I'm out
of places to turn.

20:42.866 --> 20:46.453
Uh, yeah, of course,
and-and you're not interrupting.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.331
We're done here.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.415
Well, I'll leave you
to your work, then.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.000
Uh, how about you meet me inside

20:52.042 --> 20:53.669
and, uh, just give me
one second?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.003
Okay.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.014
Oh, hey, Cristal.
Uh, it's me.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.766
Look, I know that we're supposed
to be meeting later

21:07.808 --> 21:11.061
for lunch today, but, um...

21:11.103 --> 21:13.105
I got a parishioner here
who really needs my help,

21:13.146 --> 21:15.315
so I can't make it.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.360
Um, look, I'll-I'll call you
when I can. Bye.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.237
SmartVerse is out.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.990
So we have a huge hole
to fill in our presentation.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.700
I am open to anything.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.618
Uh...
Uh...

21:26.660 --> 21:28.078
Any ideas at all.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.538
(clears throat)

21:29.579 --> 21:31.540
No? Nothing?
(phone chimes and vibrates)

21:31.581 --> 21:34.918
Ah. But first I have to go deal
with family business.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.170
So start brainstorming.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.006
Like, now.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.550
Okay. And make sure
you get a close-up

21:41.591 --> 21:43.468
where it says
"any amount you need."

21:44.261 --> 21:47.055
Thank you. No, no.
You can leave the props here.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.434
I have three more charities
coming in, so...

21:50.475 --> 21:51.977
I don't understand.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.353
What have you been doing
this whole time?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.856
Aside from eating
all of the croissants.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.400
Look, let's just focus
on Alexis's podcast.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.235
Okay? It brought us our highest
number of listeners last year.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.487
Maybe we can take it
international.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.489
I'm sure Alexis thinks
she can speak Spanish,

22:04.531 --> 22:07.075
so let's just lean
into that family angle, okay?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.120
Okay.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.748
I can do it.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.207
I told you

22:14.249 --> 22:15.709
I'm not letting you
sleep with Dawkins.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.461
And I appreciate that,

22:17.502 --> 22:19.212
but I don't have
to sleep with him.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.881
I just have to make him think
I'll sleep with him

22:20.922 --> 22:21.965
and get him to talk.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.467
You have a way to do that?

22:23.508 --> 22:25.302
I had a long chat
with Ryan last night

22:25.344 --> 22:27.679
and I basically took a crash
course in stripper school.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.015
Okay, I think stripping might be
leading him on a little bit.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.683
No clothes are coming off.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.393
See, stripping is about

22:33.435 --> 22:35.145
bonding with a customer,

22:35.187 --> 22:37.397
making him think
that he has a chance with you

22:37.439 --> 22:38.982
when he never really does.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.567
Whenever I go to a strip club,

22:40.609 --> 22:42.402
I always feel like
they're really into me.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.282
Oh, I see your point.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.950
So, I do that with Dawkins,

22:48.992 --> 22:50.202
get him to open up,

22:50.243 --> 22:51.620
and record it all.

22:51.661 --> 22:54.122
What do you think?
Well, it could work.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.874
But I'd have to be
in the room next door,

22:55.916 --> 22:57.084
just in case
something went wrong.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.211
Aw, that's so sweet.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.634
Mom.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.887
Monica, I'm so glad you made it.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.390
Of course I made it.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.517
The woman raised me;
I'm not missing her funeral.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.022
I can't believe she's gone.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.732
I just spoke to her
the other day.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.775
You did?

23:21.817 --> 23:22.901
Yeah.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.861
We talked at least once a week.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.822
I'd tell her about my life.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.574
She'd tell me about the cute
guy she saw at the market.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.160
I'm really going to miss her.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.453
We all are.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.705
I've missed you, too.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.416
It's been too long.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.709
That's kind of what happens
when people grow apart.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.922
I've been going through
some of her things.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.340
(soft laugh)

23:45.382 --> 23:47.551
Did you know she was
into fashion design?

23:47.592 --> 23:48.969
Are you kidding?

23:49.010 --> 23:50.387
No, I'm serious.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.013
I found this book.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.474
Do you know
who drew these for her?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.309
Mom.
That's Grandma's lookbook.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.602
She kept it for years.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.729
She was always designing.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.941
Which you'd know if you'd
spent any time with her.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.526
That's not fair.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.868
Look, I don't want
to argue with you.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.703
Neither do I.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.830
Which is why
I'm going to Jeff's.

24:21.626 --> 24:25.046
♪ Happy birthday, dear Leonard ♪

24:25.088 --> 24:27.841
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

24:27.883 --> 24:29.634
Yay.
(chuckles)

24:29.676 --> 24:31.761
Use it
in good health, Lenny.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.764
What did I get him?

24:34.806 --> 24:36.516
Silver cuff links.
Oh, wow.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.018
How generous of me.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.145
So you're telling me
that my father would sing

24:40.187 --> 24:41.688
every time there
was a staff birthday?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.148
Oh, no.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.524
Blake never sang.
I just thought you might start

24:44.566 --> 24:46.651
a new Carrington
tradition.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.278
That's the only reason
I'm here.
(sighs)

24:48.320 --> 24:49.654
Actually, on a more
somber note,

24:49.696 --> 24:51.031
Jeff and Monica's grandmother

24:51.072 --> 24:53.200
passed away and
her funeral is tomorrow--

24:53.241 --> 24:56.161
unfortunately, right in
the middle of your speech.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.829
Congratulate me.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.080
I am legally divorced.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.290
Okay.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.125
Well, can I congratulate you

25:02.167 --> 25:04.377
after we take some pictures
for the presentation?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.588
You'll be happy
to know your podcast

25:06.630 --> 25:08.256
is front and center.
Oh, yeah, I'm done with that.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.425
Excuse me?
Now that I have
a divorce settlement

25:10.467 --> 25:12.052
and diamonds on the way,
I can stop pretending

25:12.093 --> 25:13.762
like I care about
other people's problems.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.430
Well, what about
your daughter's problems?
I'm sorry,

25:15.472 --> 25:17.599
but I've already blasted
the news on social

25:17.641 --> 25:19.476
and it took me, like, an hour
to figure that out.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.727
So I'm not going
to take it back.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.229
ADAM:
You awarded five grants

25:22.270 --> 25:23.772
when we only have space
and money for one,

25:23.813 --> 25:25.106
so now I have to tell
four people you were kidding.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.191
Oh, that sounds
like a problem.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.484
Okay, one more word

25:27.526 --> 25:29.569
and your access roads
are blocked. Yeah.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.987
I need to talk to my team.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.489
Uh, you let them go earlier,
remember?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.824
They finished
your presentation?

25:34.866 --> 25:36.326
Oh, yes. My presentation

25:36.368 --> 25:37.827
that was about assets

25:37.869 --> 25:38.995
that no longer exist.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.289
(talking over each other)

25:41.331 --> 25:42.791
Okay, okay.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.626
Okay, okay!
No, no, no, no, everybody!

25:44.668 --> 25:45.669
Stop.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.670
Okay, go.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.672
Go, go, go, go, go. Now.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.423
(Fallon exhales)

25:59.224 --> 26:00.809
SAM:
I see you got the watch.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.143
You really shouldn't have.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.937
I know.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.272
But I really want the team.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.982
(chuckles)
Come on in.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.239
You know, I'm really glad
that we can make this work.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.578
Whoa, whoa. What's your hurry?

26:19.619 --> 26:22.664
Can we have a drink,
get to know each other?

26:22.706 --> 26:24.958
Get business
out of the way first?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.334
Sure.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.920
Let's talk about you,

26:28.962 --> 26:32.132
Mr. Deputy
Commissioner.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.383
It's a fancy title.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.634
Do you get, like,

26:34.676 --> 26:36.303
a badge with that?

26:36.344 --> 26:38.847
I don't discuss business
until you turn off your phone.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.016
Oh, uh, I would,

26:41.057 --> 26:42.350
but I have a hotel to run

26:42.392 --> 26:44.728
and people are always
calling with issues.

26:44.769 --> 26:48.064
You know how it is.
Lost luggage. Leaks.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.483
"I swear I didn't buy porn."

26:51.443 --> 26:52.777
No phone, no business.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.122
There.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.498
It's off.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.921
Okay, but seriously, did you
really do all those things?

27:11.963 --> 27:14.215
I mean, the dedications,
the birthdays,

27:14.257 --> 27:15.884
the meetings,
and run C.A.?

27:15.925 --> 27:19.554
Because if you did, a little
advice would be helpful.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.598
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, it was never easy.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.099
Yeah, that's not really advice.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.018
The only thing
that I can tell you

27:25.060 --> 27:26.895
is eventually you figure out
what to focus on.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.647
I can't tell you
what those things are

27:28.688 --> 27:30.649
because they'll be different
for you than they are for me.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.359
Okay, so...

27:32.400 --> 27:34.778
maybe the speech isn't
as important as I thought.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.488
No, no, that speech
is very important.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.156
Okay, great.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.574
Well, in that case,
I couldn't be more unprepared.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.117
Come on, that's the fun of it.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.702
Up there in front of
all those people,

27:42.744 --> 27:44.162
flying by the seat
of your pants? It's a rush.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.830
Yeah, not for me.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.625
And now I am missing my friends'
grandmother's funeral.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.043
I mean, do you know
how bad that is?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.670
I've barely spoken
to Jeff and Monica.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.171
Hey, I'll pay our respects.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.256
You focus on
what you need to focus on

27:55.298 --> 27:56.675
and everything else
will fall into place.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.219
I really hope you're right.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.012
How do you feel about
owning a soccer team?

28:02.180 --> 28:05.642
I feel like
millions of bucks.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.060
You're cute.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.107
You know, I'm gonna get you
a really good deal, but...

28:12.148 --> 28:14.317
there is a five percent tax
that you should know about.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.568
Whoa, whoa.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.362
Hold on, hold on. Five percent?

28:17.404 --> 28:18.822
That seems pretty high.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.032
It was gonna be ten
if tonight wasn't happening.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.827
Well, you see,
all new owners pay a tax.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.036
In order to get a team,

28:25.078 --> 28:26.287
you need to have
my approval.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.956
My approval has a price.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.499
So it's a bribe.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.542
Sure.

28:30.583 --> 28:31.835
You can call it a bribe.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.336
Call it whatever you want.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.839
I call it a down payment
on your commitment.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.633
You got a problem
with that?

28:38.675 --> 28:39.843
Uh, a problem?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.302
(chuckles)

28:41.344 --> 28:43.555
I rebuilt this hotel
with construction crews.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.015
I had to grease
more people than...

28:46.057 --> 28:47.642
Olivia Newton-John.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.061
So, how do I pay for
this five percent?

28:50.103 --> 28:52.230
Cash, check, Venmo?

28:52.272 --> 28:53.648
I need to be able to explain it.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.525
Shh.
Don't worry about it.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.193
If our little business
transaction goes through,

28:57.235 --> 28:58.820
I will send you

28:58.862 --> 29:01.072
a routing number where you
can have the money deposited.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.533
(phone ringing)
Whoa.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.786
Big pecs.
(phone continues ringing)

29:06.828 --> 29:09.956
Oh, I should get that. Sorry.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.169
(clears throat)

29:14.210 --> 29:15.754
Hello?

29:15.795 --> 29:17.547
MICHAEL: I heard you say
Olivia Newton-John, right?

29:17.589 --> 29:18.798
Yes, I did.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.760
Okay. Get out of there now.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.011
Yeah, I can.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.137
Right.

29:24.846 --> 29:28.099
I am so, so sorry, but I'm
gonna have to reschedule.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.059
Apparently,
there's a bar fight going on.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.561
Have the bartenders handle it.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.189
Well, they are
the ones fighting, so, uh...

29:34.230 --> 29:35.482
I will call you tomorrow.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.151
We can pick up
where we left off.

29:52.707 --> 29:54.793
(sighs)

29:57.462 --> 30:00.507
Today is difficult for me.

30:04.010 --> 30:06.304
Not only because
I lost a mother,

30:06.346 --> 30:11.017
but because I lost a mother
I didn't know that well.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.104
I thought I did.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.940
But I was wrong.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.275
And I know that now.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.904
I wish that I could
see her one more time

30:22.946 --> 30:24.656
to apologize

30:24.697 --> 30:27.742
and to tell her
how much I appreciate her.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.829
I'd ask her questions

30:30.870 --> 30:33.081
I never bothered to ask.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.251
But most importantly...

30:38.253 --> 30:39.754
I'd thank her.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.966
For raising my children...

30:45.844 --> 30:47.929
...when I left.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.058
She supported them.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.060
She loved them.

30:54.102 --> 30:57.105
She had that...

30:57.146 --> 31:00.316
maternal instinct
that I...

31:00.358 --> 31:02.944
I lost somewhere
along the way, but

31:02.986 --> 31:06.447
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life trying

31:06.489 --> 31:07.907
to find it again.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.660
Because I never want
my children

31:10.702 --> 31:12.203
to be standing here

31:12.245 --> 31:15.206
in front of friends
and family one day..

31:16.165 --> 31:18.084
...laying me to rest,

31:18.126 --> 31:21.296
regretting that we never
really knew each other.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.592
So thank you, Mom.

31:26.593 --> 31:27.302
For everything.

31:30.680 --> 31:35.393
And thank you to my kids for
showing me who she really was.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.354
I promise to be better.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.442
Thank you for seeing me.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.028
I was surprised
to hear from you.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.405
Yeah, I stopped by the other day
to listen to a sermon

31:47.447 --> 31:48.781
and I just have to tell you

31:48.823 --> 31:50.658
what a star you have
in Father Caleb.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.911
(chuckles):
I know. He's great.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.120
I'm actually meeting
with him soon.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.830
Oh, so the rumors are true.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.206
What rumors?

31:57.248 --> 31:58.708
Well, that he's leaving
the church,

31:58.750 --> 32:01.377
which would be a damn shame,
pardon my French.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.545
I haven't heard any...

32:02.587 --> 32:03.922
You know, in business,

32:03.963 --> 32:05.381
when someone is as good
as Father Caleb,

32:05.423 --> 32:06.966
you make it impossible
for them to leave.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.885
Promotion, money, anything.
Money? (chuckles)

32:08.927 --> 32:10.553
It's been tight lately.

32:10.595 --> 32:14.891
I can help with that,
for the good of the church.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.809
You can take care
of everything else.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.771
It would really mean a lot
to me, and to your flock.

32:19.812 --> 32:22.440
Why don't you get yourself
some shiny new pews

32:22.482 --> 32:23.942
while you're at it.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.111
Let's just keep this
between us.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.530
FALLON:
Hello, everyone,

32:29.572 --> 32:31.240
and welcome
to Fallon Unlimited's

32:31.282 --> 32:33.076
State of the Company Address.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.287
I'm Fallon Carrington,
and I am here to tell you

32:36.329 --> 32:39.332
the state of our company
has never been better.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.751
(applause)

32:43.044 --> 32:46.464
You know, someone told me that
if you focus on what matters,

32:46.506 --> 32:48.424
the rest will fall into place.

32:48.466 --> 32:52.053
Well, I can tell you this
company means the world to me,

32:52.095 --> 32:54.430
and my focus
has never been sharper.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.308
That's because Fallon Unlimited
is not just a company.

32:57.350 --> 33:01.354
It is a family--
a large, sometimes dysfunctional

33:01.396 --> 33:04.357
but definitely
trending upwards family.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.860
And when it comes down to it,
family is all that matters.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.697
It's, um...

33:12.281 --> 33:13.825
It's...

33:13.866 --> 33:15.910
Well, it is...

33:15.952 --> 33:19.831
the most important thing,
and that's...

33:19.872 --> 33:22.375
that's why you have
to be there for them.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.794
Um...

33:24.836 --> 33:28.047
I'm gonna have to cut
this speech short.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.757
I'm sorry.
A couple close friends of mine

33:29.799 --> 33:31.884
lost someone they love.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.762
And I missed the funeral today
to be here

33:34.804 --> 33:36.723
because I thought
it was more important,

33:36.764 --> 33:41.477
and, uh, and I was wrong,
so I'm gonna go make it right.

33:41.519 --> 33:45.857
I'm going to go see my people
and I'm gonna be there for them

33:45.898 --> 33:49.360
and I suggest the rest of you
do the same.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.737
Okay.
MAN: Ms. Carrington.

33:50.778 --> 33:51.988
Thank you.
WOMAN: Ms. Carrington.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.036
I know it's a cliché,
but she lived a full life.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.537
She definitely did.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.622
We had some rough times
when I was a kid,

34:01.664 --> 34:04.751
that's for sure, but she
mellowed as she got older.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.210
Or maybe you mellowed.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.837
(both laugh)

34:07.879 --> 34:10.548
I got to head home.
And I'm sorry for your loss.

34:10.590 --> 34:13.092
But I'm happy
I got a chance to see you.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.803
It's been too long.
I know. Me, too.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.645
Hey.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.773
I'm so sorry
I wasn't there earlier.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.775
I messed up.
I know you're
always there for me

34:28.816 --> 34:31.194
when I need you,
and you're here now.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.321
What happened
with your presentation?

34:33.362 --> 34:36.074
I cut it short.
This is where I should be.

34:36.115 --> 34:38.409
Plus, your grandmother
would have kicked my ass

34:38.451 --> 34:40.078
if she knew
I wasn't at her funeral.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.746
(chuckles)
True.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.998
She did think you were always
getting me into trouble.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.000
Yes.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.795
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

34:48.836 --> 34:50.296
I just need to have
a conversation

34:50.338 --> 34:52.131
I'm not looking forward to.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.968
Hey, thanks
for making it.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.470
Means a lot.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.972
I heard I missed
a pretty epic eulogy from Dom.

35:00.014 --> 35:03.142
Yeah, it was definitely
a little surprising.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.269
Surprising good
or surprising bad?

35:05.311 --> 35:06.646
Not sure yet.

35:06.687 --> 35:07.980
That's the thing with Dom--

35:08.022 --> 35:09.982
you can never really tell.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.193
Thanks again.
Yeah.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.490
Wedge salad for the lady?

35:17.532 --> 35:21.035
No bacon?
Oh. Right. Thank you.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.329
Is everything all right?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.497
Yeah.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.541
I'm fine. Sorry.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.418
I just...

35:30.586 --> 35:32.088
...have a lot on my mind.

35:32.130 --> 35:36.134
Oh, well, me, too.
Uh, that's actually

35:36.175 --> 35:38.094
what I wanted
to talk to you about.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.846
Is everything okay?

35:39.887 --> 35:41.681
How was your meeting
with the bishop?

35:41.722 --> 35:43.015
(sighs)
It...

35:43.057 --> 35:44.684
You know,
it didn't go exactly as planned.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.146
He offered me a raise
and then a promotion,

35:48.187 --> 35:51.023
which I didn't accept,
because I wanted to talk to you

35:51.065 --> 35:53.401
before I made
any decisions.

35:57.363 --> 36:00.867
After yesterday, I don't
know if I can do this.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.076
Yesterday?

36:02.118 --> 36:03.703
What, because I canceled lunch?

36:03.744 --> 36:05.413
Because you canceled lunch

36:05.454 --> 36:07.498
to help someone else,
and I could hear in your voice

36:07.540 --> 36:09.125
how passionate you were.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.920
Yeah, I love what I do,
but I do love you, too.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.755
I've never questioned that.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.550
But I don't know
if I can keep you

36:17.592 --> 36:19.343
from that kind of fulfillment.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.430
Yeah, talking to that guy
yesterday,

36:22.471 --> 36:24.098
helping him find
his faith,

36:24.140 --> 36:27.560
it made me think
how much I'm going to miss that.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.109
No matter how I
feel about you,

36:35.151 --> 36:37.987
I can't keep you
from your calling.

36:39.238 --> 36:43.201
I would be happy, I'm sure,
because of who you are, but...

36:44.452 --> 36:45.995
...I would always be there.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.289
I think you're right.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.124
Yeah.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.711
This is the best decision.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.006
(sighs):
Hmm.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.094
I meant what I said,
every word.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.471
I know you did.

37:03.512 --> 37:06.140
I'm more concerned
with your actions,

37:06.182 --> 37:08.643
and those usually let me down.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.895
I know I let my goals get
in the way of being your mom,

37:10.937 --> 37:12.688
and I know I hurt you

37:12.730 --> 37:15.191
by spending so much time
with Vanessa,

37:15.233 --> 37:17.485
but she's not talking
to me either now.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.570
We're still talking, Mom.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.867
Let me come back to New York
with you for a few weeks.

37:24.909 --> 37:28.996
We can start rebuilding
our relationship on your terms.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.165
But you have
to open the door.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.377
Okay.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.047
Oh, I almost forgot.

37:38.965 --> 37:43.177
Grandma would have loved
for you to have this.

37:47.098 --> 37:51.143
I still can't believe
I didn't know about this.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.854
Though I guess it runs
in the family, since I started

37:53.896 --> 37:55.606
Doma-sleek by Dominique.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.442
(laughs)
You talking about pajamas again?

37:58.484 --> 38:00.486
Elegant sleepwear.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.071
(chuckles)

38:03.948 --> 38:05.658
Well, look at the three
of us, huh?

38:05.700 --> 38:07.660
I like it.
Me, too.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.290
In fact,
I'm going back to New York

38:12.331 --> 38:16.502
to spend some time with Monica,
and I would love for you to go.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.255
Yeah, I'm not ready
for that yet.

38:20.423 --> 38:21.882
I understand.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.844
I'll be right back.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.475
I need to...

38:31.517 --> 38:33.728
figure out
the person I want to be

38:33.769 --> 38:36.314
before I can deal
with the person I
want you to be.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.317
I just can't be part of
that Carrington drama anymore.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.860
I don't want you to be.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.194
It's my issue.

38:42.236 --> 38:43.696
They don't treat me like
a Carrington,

38:43.738 --> 38:46.240
and I deserve
at least that much.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.952
I just want to be seen.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.956
To be acknowledged
as part of the family.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.876
I've given up a lot
to try to get that.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.045
I'm not stopping now.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.923
Well, that I definitely
understand.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.312
Hey, there he is,
man of the hour.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.981
Got some talking points.
Why don't you look 'em over?

39:21.484 --> 39:23.110
I don't need those.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.614
Here are some points for you.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.657
Sam Jones
won't be buying the team,

39:28.699 --> 39:30.785
and neither will any
of your golfing buddies.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.872
Have you lost your mind?

39:34.914 --> 39:37.249
I can pin this whole betting
scheme on you in five minutes.

39:37.291 --> 39:40.669
And it will take me
ten seconds to play this.

39:40.711 --> 39:44.548
DAWKINS:
Sure. Call it a bribe,
call it whatever you want.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.675
I call it a down payment
on your commitment.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.139
How'd you get that?

39:52.181 --> 39:55.726
That's a dope watch.
You should take a closer look.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.269
It does more
than tell time.

39:57.311 --> 40:00.773
It records conversations,
sends copies to the cloud.

40:00.815 --> 40:04.193
That kind of thing.
It's a new chip or something.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.237
So here are
your talking points.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.406
I have a group of Black business
owners willing to buy the team.

40:08.447 --> 40:10.491
You'll be signing off on that.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.536
And you're going to stop
that gambling ring

40:13.577 --> 40:16.747
right before you announce
your retirement.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.420
You should be happy:
you're one handshake away

40:22.461 --> 40:24.547
from staying out of jail.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.219
So Father Caleb
got his promotion.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.763
Have you spoken to Cristal
since the news came out?

40:32.805 --> 40:34.265
No, I'm going to keep
my distance for a while,

40:34.306 --> 40:36.183
make sure she
doesn't suspect me of anything.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.853
BLAKE:
Look, there he is,
our guy from the church.

40:38.894 --> 40:40.729
I'll leave you to it.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.321
A little something
for a job well done.

40:49.363 --> 40:51.991
Always happy to make
a little extra cash on the side.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.119
Looks like your friend
the priest totally bought it.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.579
Let me know
if you need anything else.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.497
The only thing we need
is for you

40:58.539 --> 41:00.166
to forget this ever happened.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.251
Okay.

41:08.090 --> 41:11.385
So, was there any fallout
from your speech?

41:11.427 --> 41:13.679
Actually, yes.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.431
SmartVerse called.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.600
They had a change of heart.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.478
Apparently, they are
all about family, too.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.897
So the sale went
through after all.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.857
Congratulations.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.109
(chuckles)

41:28.527 --> 41:32.198
You know, I could use someone
to run it for me,

41:32.239 --> 41:33.949
someone with
experience,

41:33.991 --> 41:35.576
someone I trust.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.702
You know, this would be
very mean

41:36.744 --> 41:37.661
if you aren't talking about me.

41:37.703 --> 41:39.371
I know how much you miss it.

41:39.413 --> 41:40.831
I do.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.209
So the answer is yes.
Good.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.753
Though I don't think you
should limit me to SmartVerse.

41:45.794 --> 41:48.214
I've been reading
about your other divisions
and I have some ideas.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.257
I actually wrote them down
somewhere.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.301
This is going to be great--
father and daughter

41:52.343 --> 41:54.428
side by side,
building an empire.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.388
Ah. Yeah. Right here.

41:56.430 --> 41:59.892
Now, let me tell you
what I was thinking.
