00:06.760 --> 00:08.959
Jess, I...

00:08.960 --> 00:12.960
Jess.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.479
It's Alex.
They're giving him a lung transplant.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.759
- Shit.
- I tell you now.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.760
You don't want to be getting
a transplant round here.

Hi. How are you? OK?
Good. You're Alex, right?

01:14.360 --> 01:17.039
I'm not being funny,
but you have to have sex with me.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.919
I've only just got out of surgery.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.039
You need to leave.
We're just talking.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.519
Get him out of here.
Please! You have to fuck me!

01:23.520 --> 01:26.320
Call security!
Think about it! Think about it!

02:31.200 --> 02:34.719
OK. Bye.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.919
Alex is out of surgery.
He's going to be OK.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.879
Ah! Get in, mate! Well done.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.199
I tell you now, I never
doubted it for a second.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.919
The handsome barman lives.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.959
Come on. Dude, you need
to pay up right now.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.559
That's 20 of your English pounds.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.439
Fucking pygmy.
Let's have it, come on.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.439
You... you put money on him dying?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.719
Yeah!

02:51.720 --> 02:55.720
No! No. What kind of person
do you think I am?

02:56.080 --> 02:58.879
You said it would be funny
if they chopped his cock off

02:58.880 --> 03:00.119
during the operation.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.599
There's something very wrong
with you. Oh, Finn.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.079
Honestly.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.159
Well, I'm glad he didn't die. I am.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.719
But I will say this.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.599
He may have a new lung,

03:11.600 --> 03:15.600
but you can't replace
his cheating heart.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.080
Twat.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.919
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:24.920 --> 03:27.719
Scouts, dude! Yes! You're Scouts.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.839
These were the happiest and
the proudest days of my life.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.959
Look at 'em!

03:31.960 --> 03:33.759
You were in the Scouts?

03:33.760 --> 03:36.119
That should never have been allowed.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.439
I swore... I swore a solemn oath to,
you know, to obey the Scout Law,

03:39.440 --> 03:41.639
to do my best, to do my duty to God

03:41.640 --> 03:44.719
and Her lovely majestic
Majesty the Queen.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.079
Huh. Lived by a code.
I were like a samurai warrior.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.239
Yeah, that's... that's you all over.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.319
And then... and then
they cast me out.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.999
Why were you cast out?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.159
I don't want to talk about it.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.639
I will say this.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.079
A Scout is meant to walk an
impossible line

04:00.080 --> 04:02.839
between his love of scouting
and his raging hormones

04:02.840 --> 04:05.919
in the first flushes
of sexual adventure.

04:05.920 --> 04:06.959
There are girls!

04:06.960 --> 04:09.519
You're a girl! Shit!

04:09.520 --> 04:12.759
That's an unnatural abomination.
This is not how Baden-Powell intended it!

04:12.760 --> 04:16.519
Take that uniform off!
You look like a dick!

04:16.519 --> 04:20.519
Shit.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.879
Is he still staring?
He's really staring.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.999
He's gone.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.359
Look at 'em. Scouts... Scouts
is a time for boys to be boys.

04:28.360 --> 04:31.159
You know, the... the first time
I masturbated. Scouts.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.359
The first time I ever saw
another boy's penis. Scouts.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.999
First time I touched
another boy's penis. Scouts.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.919
First time another boy
touched my penis.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.199
Scouts? It was in Scouts!

04:41.200 --> 04:45.200
It was in Scouts. Happy,
sunlit days is what they were.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.400
Oh, my God. Look at this tramp.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.519
Hi.
Ahem. Hi. Ahem! Hi.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.119
What the fuck was that?

05:00.120 --> 05:04.120
Shame on you, Finley!

05:06.840 --> 05:10.840
You've got a visitor.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.680
Handsome barman! Here he is.
How you diddling, mate?

05:18.200 --> 05:21.559
Eh? I've brought you
some grapes and that.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.479
I haven't brought you any grapes.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.279
How's Jess?

05:25.280 --> 05:29.280
She's dead.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.359
She's not really dead.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.560
I was just trying
to make you feel better.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.799
So...

05:38.800 --> 05:40.839
she didn't want to come and see me?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.999
Yes, she did.
She wanted to come, but she...

05:44.000 --> 05:47.559
She hates my guts, doesn't she?
She doesn't hate your guts, man.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.479
Well, maybe. I don't know. She...
Do you... do you know what, man?

05:50.480 --> 05:53.359
Who could ever possibly
understand the inner workings...

05:53.360 --> 05:55.479
They've got little
fickle minds, mate.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.839
My dad, he used to say to me,
you know, he used to say,

05:57.840 --> 06:01.840
"Rudy, women are very much
like tractors."

06:02.280 --> 06:04.839
Which I have never understood.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.959
I think it's something, really,
to do with potatoes.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.119
That's what it is. Shit.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.120
They're just not like men,
seriously.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.399
Hi.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.479
What's this badge for?
Fire safety.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.119
I know who to call
if there's a fire, then.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.559
You should call the Fire Service,

06:37.560 --> 06:40.559
activate the fire alarm and leave
by the nearest emergency exit.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.560
Right, yeah. Good... good to know.
You know, always... be prepared.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.679
What about this one?

06:49.680 --> 06:52.479
Global Conservation.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.480
First aid. Road safety.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.759
This one here is for fucking.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.159
Really? They...
they give badges for that?

07:03.160 --> 07:04.639
No.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.599
Yeah, I know.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.000
Because of health and safety...

07:10.600 --> 07:11.999
..and AIDS.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Have you ever fucked a Scout before?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.799
Have I?

07:17.800 --> 07:20.159
That would be a... a no.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.959
No, I haven't.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.960
I...I fingered a Girl Guide, though.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.799
Do you mind if I tie you up?

07:34.800 --> 07:37.519
You are full of surprises. Go for it.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.479
I hate to sound like my dad,
but are you over 16?

07:40.480 --> 07:44.480
I'm 18. Ah.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.399
What type of knot are you using?

07:49.400 --> 07:53.400
A double constrictor knot,
almost impossible to get out of.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.360
Ooh, good choice.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.079
OK. Now lie down.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.520
Right there.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.759
He's ready.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.999
Oh! Oh!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.399
Oh!

08:17.400 --> 08:21.400
Oh, shit.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.279
- Hi.
- Oh!

08:25.280 --> 08:28.959
Shit. Do you want tell me
what the fuck is going on?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.999
You are to become one of us.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.958
A Scout? Can't I just
fill in a membership form?

08:34.960 --> 08:37.519
You are to become an agent of Satan.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.520
And if I say no?

08:43.039 --> 08:44.599
Oh, shit. Shit.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.079
Then I'll cut out your heart
and burn it in hellfire.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.839
Is that a chicken?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.679
Oh, you... you've got the wrong guy.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.519
I'd make a terrible agent of Satan.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.520
I'm... I'm lazy, and...
and disorganised,

08:58.600 --> 09:01.159
and ask anyone who knows me,
I'm... I'm shit.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.559
Ecce Satanas meo...

09:04.560 --> 09:07.479
sicut ego et ipse regnabit Dominus

09:07.480 --> 09:09.039

09:09.040 --> 09:11.560
meam tenebris...

09:12.880 --> 09:14.199
Jesus! Fuck!

09:14.200 --> 09:15.559
You killed the chicken!

09:15.560 --> 09:19.560
Lucifer habitabunt in te!

09:25.800 --> 09:27.600
Aah! Aah!

09:31.520 --> 09:35.520
Aah.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.599
You should see his scar.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.719
Dude looks like Action Man.
What an handsome barman!

09:47.720 --> 09:50.799
You've seen him?
Of course I've bloody seen him.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.759
We're best mates. Some people say...

09:54.760 --> 09:56.959
..we look like brothers. Ahem!

09:56.960 --> 09:58.679
You're best mates? Mm-hm.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.319
Really? Erm... what's his surname?

10:00.320 --> 10:03.239
Kagi... Kagillima.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.599
Kagillima?
It's... it's...

10:06.600 --> 10:09.399
it's Wong... Smith.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.679
Wong-Smith?
I know. It's ridiculous, innit?

10:12.680 --> 10:15.639
So, you know how the handsome
barman saved your life?

10:15.640 --> 10:18.119
Does that cancel him out
shagging that girl?

10:18.120 --> 10:21.159
Cos it feels about the same to me.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.439
Why are you so interested?

10:22.440 --> 10:25.359
Because if you stop seeing him,
he'll just... he'll leave, won't he?

10:25.360 --> 10:27.639
He'll wander from town to town
like The Littlest Hobo.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.320
And, Jess, I don't know whether my fragile
heart could ever take any more of...

10:32.840 --> 10:35.279
You're not going to believe
what's just happened to me.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.719
Were you bent over double again,
sucking yourself off,

10:37.720 --> 10:39.879
bit of pollen's gone up your nose,
you've sneezed,

10:39.880 --> 10:41.479
you've bit the tip off your penis...

10:41.480 --> 10:43.239

Of course they don't look
like agents of Satan.

11:13.399 --> 11:16.478
Agents of Satan never look
like agents of Satan, do they?

11:16.479 --> 11:17.699
Mm.

11:17.784 --> 11:20.023
You don't believe me, do you?

11:20.024 --> 11:23.463
You think it's all just a desperately
sad and lonely cry for attention.

Yeah, well, I told them you were

What's that? Chicken blood?

11:32.424 --> 11:33.543
Hm?

11:33.544 --> 11:36.463
It was Finley.

What? It was Finley.

11:38.584 --> 11:42.584

No.

supplying local restaurants

11:56.744 --> 11:59.823
and kebab houses with dodgy meat...

11:59.824 --> 12:02.463
You won't, cos I haven't.

12:02.464 --> 12:06.023
Then we don't have a problem, do we?

How do you know where I live?

12:35.344 --> 12:39.223
So, I guess I kind of followed
you home from the hospital.

12:39.224 --> 12:43.143
Don't freak out. Look, I don't know
what your problem is. I don't care.

12:43.144 --> 12:46.503
So, can you just piss off?

12:46.504 --> 12:49.583
Oh, fuck! Oh!

12:49.584 --> 12:52.543
Fuck!

12:52.544 --> 12:55.303
The door slamming like that.
It wasn't an accident.

12:55.304 --> 12:58.543
Well, it was, but it was me.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.463
I've got this power.

13:00.464 --> 13:04.464
I cause accidents. It's a nightmare.
Neil said he could make it stop.

Who's Neil?

13:07.184 --> 13:10.823
You've got his lung.
They transplanted it into you.

13:10.824 --> 13:14.303
He had this power. He could fuck
other people's powers out of them.

13:14.304 --> 13:18.304
He was going to fuck my power
out of me. Is that what he told you?

13:18.584 --> 13:20.263
He was after a shag.

13:20.264 --> 13:23.663
I've spoken to people he helped.
He took their power.

13:23.664 --> 13:26.063
His power's been
transplanted into you.

13:26.064 --> 13:29.543
Is this a wind-up?

13:29.544 --> 13:32.983
Did Jess put you up to this?

13:32.984 --> 13:36.984
It's a test, isn't it?
And if I shag you then I fail.

13:37.344 --> 13:39.383
Well. Ha!

13:39.384 --> 13:43.384
Good try. Because
it's not going to happen.

13:47.504 --> 13:50.383
Seriously.

13:50.384 --> 13:52.423
Take a hint.

13:52.424 --> 13:54.743
The catch on the
dishwasher door broke.

13:54.744 --> 13:58.503
I tripped over it,
fell on a potato peeler.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.504
The handle of a mug of tea
snapped off as I was drinking it.

14:07.184 --> 14:08.703
Jesus.

14:08.704 --> 14:12.704
There was a loose paving slab
at the top of a flight of steps.

14:14.784 --> 14:18.784
I don't even remember
what all these are.

14:25.424 --> 14:29.063
That's just a birthmark.

14:29.064 --> 14:31.503
I've got money. I'll pay you.

14:31.504 --> 14:35.504
I don't... I don't want your money.

14:40.624 --> 14:43.023
You cheated on me,
and I can't forgive you for that.

14:43.024 --> 14:45.303
Maybe I should be able
to get over it because

14:45.304 --> 14:47.343
I really fucking like you,
but I can't.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.143
We were together and
you shagged her,

14:50.144 --> 14:53.143
and I really fucking
hate you for that,

14:53.144 --> 14:57.144
but then you go and get yourself
stabbed for me and you save my life.

14:58.344 --> 15:01.463
Why did you shag her?

15:01.464 --> 15:02.623
Why would you do that?

15:02.624 --> 15:06.624
Because now I have to end it with
you and that is really fucking hard!

15:09.944 --> 15:13.944
Say something, then, you dick.

15:15.264 --> 15:17.463
I promise...

15:17.464 --> 15:21.383
it is not what you think.

15:21.384 --> 15:23.383
Oh, my God. No.

15:23.384 --> 15:26.463
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No. It's not like that.

15:26.464 --> 15:30.343
You unbelievable fucking twat!
You just made it so much easier!

15:30.344 --> 15:33.623
It's a power thing, Jess!

15:33.624 --> 15:36.544
Please can we fuck now?
You're not helping!

15:57.224 --> 15:59.383
Well.

15:59.384 --> 16:01.623
Look who it is.

16:01.624 --> 16:05.624
Yeah, well, look who it is...
right back at you.

16:06.744 --> 16:10.463
Have you seen this?
I'm going to have a scar.

16:10.464 --> 16:13.143
You were trying to convert me
into an agent of Satan.

16:13.144 --> 16:17.144
You don't have to worry
about that any more.

16:17.344 --> 16:21.344
I'm going to rip out your heart
and shove it up your arse.

16:27.424 --> 16:29.903
Rudy!

16:29.904 --> 16:33.904
Guys, a little help!

16:48.664 --> 16:52.664
Seriously?

16:53.824 --> 16:57.824
Whoa!

17:04.104 --> 17:07.782
Who's laughing now?

17:07.784 --> 17:10.583
Hoc cecidit angelus devorabit vos!

17:10.584 --> 17:11.782
Rudy!

17:11.784 --> 17:15.262
Resident in tua anima, mea tenebris
emergere reget hoc mundo!

17:15.263 --> 17:16.823
Fuck off! Fuck off!

17:16.824 --> 17:20.824
Lucifer reget hoc mundo,
ego reget huius mundi pro aeterno!

17:41.464 --> 17:43.383
You've killed the Scout leader.

17:43.384 --> 17:45.823
See, I told you he
was trying to ki...

17:45.824 --> 17:47.743
Ah. What's wrong with you?

17:47.744 --> 17:50.183
She dared me to swallow
my full Cornetto in one go, man.

17:50.184 --> 17:51.703
It's given me the worse brain...

17:51.704 --> 17:53.623
I thought I were going
to die for a minute.

17:53.624 --> 17:56.223
We got you one.

17:56.224 --> 17:57.543
Ooh. Thanks.

17:57.544 --> 18:01.544
Hey, monkey boy, you done good
there. From wankster...

18:03.744 --> 18:07.063
..to... to gangster.
That's a G. Yeah.

18:07.064 --> 18:09.523
We should probably bury him.

18:09.524 --> 18:12.788
I'll get the shovels. Ah.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.417
Loop it over once.

18:36.418 --> 18:38.258
Twice.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.025
Left over right.

18:40.026 --> 18:41.985
Through the rabbit hole.

18:41.986 --> 18:43.385
Bastard!

18:43.386 --> 18:46.945
I just thought...

18:46.946 --> 18:48.665
For God's sake.

18:48.666 --> 18:50.905
What?

18:50.906 --> 18:53.305
Fucking what?
What are you staring at?

18:53.306 --> 18:56.465
What, you never seen a grown man in
his childhood Scout uniform before?

18:56.466 --> 18:58.625
You need to get out more, pal.

18:58.626 --> 19:00.065
Just take that.

19:00.066 --> 19:02.265
What's this? What am I looking at?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.745
It's a support group.
It's for people with powers.

19:05.746 --> 19:08.785
And I think we should...
I think we should go.

19:08.786 --> 19:10.425
Do you?
Well, yeah, it's a...

19:10.426 --> 19:13.546
it's a good opportunity to...
for us to talk about our situation.

19:13.646 --> 19:14.805
Bastard!

19:14.806 --> 19:18.806
...in a... in a non-judgmental,
confidential environment.

19:19.806 --> 19:22.645
What situation?
There is no situation, dude.

19:22.646 --> 19:26.646
There's absolutely
nothing to see here!

19:27.606 --> 19:30.485
I just think... I think we need to
talk about our future, together.

19:30.486 --> 19:34.486
And I just... I thought you might
want to be with me while we do it.

19:54.686 --> 19:56.605
For crying out loud!
Look at Finley, eh?

19:56.606 --> 19:59.205
Look at him. Frigging
confident and flirtatious.

19:59.206 --> 20:02.605
Dibs on that bloody fragrant
blonde he's talking to.

20:02.606 --> 20:05.285
Why are you telling us?

20:05.286 --> 20:07.005
It's not who you tell.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.205
It's the act of saying it out loud
that makes it legally binding.

20:10.206 --> 20:13.405
I don't make the bloody rules,
love, but I will abide by them.

20:13.406 --> 20:16.525
Shit.
Mm? Here he is!

20:16.526 --> 20:19.685
Handsome barman. Ali G in the house.
See what I did there?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.645
Dude, see what... Cos your name's...

20:21.646 --> 20:23.845
Cos your name's Alex.
I just put a G on it.

20:23.846 --> 20:26.725
It's not what you think.
Seriously. I'm not interested.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.685
Yeah, but I didn't even shag her.
Oh, no way. He's done it again!

20:30.686 --> 20:33.366
Mongrel. Look here.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.765
Can we please do this somewhere else?

20:37.766 --> 20:39.925
Do what somewhere else?

20:39.926 --> 20:43.765
She found him shagging
another girl. That's twice now.

20:43.766 --> 20:46.045
Why am I not surprised?

20:46.046 --> 20:50.046
Seriously. Don't.

20:51.566 --> 20:55.566
Oh, am... am I supposed to be scared?

21:03.086 --> 21:05.085
Finn!
Are you scared now?

21:05.086 --> 21:06.685
Fuck off, you little prick!

21:06.686 --> 21:10.525
Finlay? What are you doing with
the handsome barman? Put him down!

21:10.526 --> 21:14.005
Stop it! Stop it!

21:14.006 --> 21:16.485
He will always shit on you,
cos that's who he is.

21:16.486 --> 21:18.325
He can't help himself.

21:18.326 --> 21:22.326
You need to wake up
and smell the arsehole.

21:30.726 --> 21:33.725
Hey!

21:33.726 --> 21:37.726
Hey! I thought of a good reason
why you should fuck me!

21:55.006 --> 21:57.365
There's definitely
something going on with Finn.

21:57.366 --> 22:00.445
Oh, yeah, I think he's
going through puberty.

22:00.446 --> 22:03.605
You know, it's a very
confusing time for any young man.

22:03.606 --> 22:07.606
I thought you said you were going to
talk to him. And I did.

22:07.686 --> 22:10.445
What did he say? Well, I had to wait
for the right moment, you know.

22:10.446 --> 22:12.885
I sat him down,
just put my arm around him.

22:12.886 --> 22:16.725
We just sat there for a moment,
bit of quiet contemplation, one man,

22:16.726 --> 22:18.526
another substantially smaller man.

22:20.606 --> 22:21.925
And?

22:21.926 --> 22:24.885
He went, "I'm fine. I'm good."

22:24.886 --> 22:26.125
So, we're actually no closer

22:26.126 --> 22:28.765
to knowing why Finn was
behaving like a total psycho?

22:28.766 --> 22:31.245
Oh, for God's sake, Jess.
When a man wants to talk to you,

22:31.246 --> 22:33.325
you're going to see
his lips moving like this.

22:33.326 --> 22:37.326
And when he doesn't, he's in...
in his special quiet place,

22:38.006 --> 22:42.006
a shed of the mind.

23:21.846 --> 23:25.005
Hello. Welcome to the group.

23:25.006 --> 23:29.006
Take a seat.

23:49.086 --> 23:52.845
Why don't you tell us who you are
and a little bit about your power?

23:52.846 --> 23:56.846
Erm...

23:58.766 --> 24:01.725
I'm Rudy.

24:01.726 --> 24:04.805
Well, Rudy Two.

24:04.806 --> 24:08.806
And I was created by the storm.

24:08.846 --> 24:12.846
I suppose you could say...

24:12.886 --> 24:16.886
..I'm the living embodiment
of a split personality disorder.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.965
Hi, Rudy Two.

24:19.966 --> 24:23.645
Hi, Rudy Two.

24:23.646 --> 24:26.086
Hiya.

24:32.086 --> 24:36.086
Hi.

24:37.326 --> 24:41.326
Look, I... I don't even know
if I've got this bloke's power.

24:42.846 --> 24:46.846
There's only one way to find out.
Slip it up there.

24:50.926 --> 24:53.205
Do we have to have full sex?

24:53.206 --> 24:57.206
I don't know if coming on my tits
is really going to cut it.

24:57.366 --> 24:59.285
I just don't want to hurt you.

24:59.286 --> 25:03.286
I'm so stuffed full of painkillers
I won't feel a thing.

25:08.566 --> 25:12.566
This is a chance to use
your cock for good.

25:51.406 --> 25:54.365
What's the story
with you and that girl?

25:54.366 --> 25:57.045
I messed up. I cheated on her.

25:57.046 --> 25:59.325
You still like her?

25:59.326 --> 26:02.005
Yeah.

26:02.006 --> 26:04.205
So, why did you cheat on her?

26:04.206 --> 26:08.206
Can we talk about something else?
Whatever you like.

26:08.686 --> 26:11.205
I fucking hate guys like you.
Oh, do you want me to stop?

26:11.206 --> 26:12.845
Cos there's plenty of
girls I can fuck

26:12.846 --> 26:16.846
that don't look like
a big bag of shit and blood.

26:17.286 --> 26:18.805
Sorry.

26:18.806 --> 26:21.725
I shouldn't have said anything.
No, I... I can't do this.

26:21.726 --> 26:25.726
Please. I'm sorry.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.325
How do we know when it's worked?

26:33.326 --> 26:37.326
I don't know.

26:40.406 --> 26:42.165
Oh, Jesus.

26:42.166 --> 26:43.965
Are you coming?

26:43.966 --> 26:47.966
No, it's, er... mm, it's something
else. What the fuck is that?

27:01.126 --> 27:03.725
Oh.

27:03.726 --> 27:07.005
Oh.

27:07.006 --> 27:11.006
Thank you.

27:24.246 --> 27:25.606
Well, Barbara...

27:30.526 --> 27:34.526
Rudy?

27:34.686 --> 27:38.085
All right, Finn? Is this
a dream? You look taller.

27:38.086 --> 27:40.205
I've got something for you.

27:40.206 --> 27:42.405
Oh! Is it a present?

27:42.406 --> 27:44.605
You'll see.
A present for my birthday!

27:44.606 --> 27:46.925
It's a surprise.

27:46.926 --> 27:50.245
Is it Scalextric?
I bloody love Scalextric!

27:50.246 --> 27:54.246
Take me to it!
Take me... take me to it.

27:54.966 --> 27:58.565
Hey. Oh.

27:58.566 --> 28:00.165
Yeah.

28:00.166 --> 28:03.005
I like what you've done here, the
chicken and the candles and stuff.

28:03.006 --> 28:04.325
I don't even know what this is.

28:04.326 --> 28:06.965
I can see you've gone to a lot
of trouble, dude, but I just...

28:06.966 --> 28:10.966
Shit, man, I kind of had my heart
set on Scalextric a little bit.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.645
Ecce Satanas meo...

28:12.646 --> 28:15.365
Hey.
..sicut ego et ipse regnabit

28:15.366 --> 28:17.605
meam tenebris.

28:17.606 --> 28:20.205
What, are we speaking French, eh?
Je m'appelle Rudy!

28:20.206 --> 28:24.206
Dude, j'habite la community centre.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.685
Finn?

28:28.686 --> 28:31.445
What the fuck?

28:31.446 --> 28:35.446
Finn?

29:04.246 --> 29:05.805
Finn's the devil.

29:05.806 --> 29:08.845
Or... or at least an agent of Satan,
or whatever they call themselves.

29:08.846 --> 29:11.005
That's why he's been
acting so weird.

29:11.006 --> 29:14.805
When he killed that, erm...
Scout leader guy, I... I don't...

29:14.806 --> 29:17.845
I...I don't know, I think
something...

29:17.846 --> 29:19.765
I think happened to him.

29:19.766 --> 29:22.045
Finn?

29:22.046 --> 29:25.405
No. He's too short to be the devil.

29:25.406 --> 29:28.685
You're bleeding.

29:28.686 --> 29:32.245
Mm.

29:32.246 --> 29:34.605
I've got my period.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.606
What are you hiding
behind your back?

29:38.726 --> 29:42.726
Nothing.

29:48.006 --> 29:52.006
It's a dead chicken.

29:55.006 --> 29:57.405
You're one of them.

29:57.406 --> 30:01.406
Do you want to know something?
You're next.

30:12.726 --> 30:14.165
Hiya, Jess.

30:14.166 --> 30:15.805
I know what you are.

30:15.806 --> 30:18.525
I'm just a cheeky little Scouser.

30:18.526 --> 30:20.445
Eh? Eh?

30:20.446 --> 30:23.045
Eh? Calm down! Calm down!

30:23.046 --> 30:25.965
You're the devil.

30:25.966 --> 30:28.885
The devil.

30:28.886 --> 30:29.925
What's she like?

30:29.926 --> 30:31.725
She's hilarious.

30:31.726 --> 30:34.405
So funny. You're funny.

30:34.406 --> 30:36.765
She's... she's one of you!
You've converted her!

30:36.766 --> 30:38.925
No.

30:38.926 --> 30:41.485
It's all in that pretty
little head of yours.

30:41.486 --> 30:44.605
Oh, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it!

30:44.606 --> 30:46.125
Shitting hell.

30:46.126 --> 30:50.125
Chickens are fed, dude. So...

30:50.126 --> 30:52.605
I meant... monkeys.

30:52.606 --> 30:56.606
Shit. Shit! Fuck!

30:56.766 --> 30:58.210
That's bad.

31:23.405 --> 31:26.284
I, er... I haven't had sex with
anyone. I've just been in the shower.

31:26.285 --> 31:30.285
Believe it or not, the world
does not revolve around your cock!

31:30.845 --> 31:34.205
Bit harsh.

31:34.299 --> 31:35.578
So, what are you going to do?

31:35.579 --> 31:38.498
I don't know. I can't go back to the
community centre. I can't go home.

31:38.499 --> 31:40.018
They'll be looking for me.

31:40.019 --> 31:42.778
Well, um... you know, you can...

31:42.779 --> 31:45.698
You can stay here
tonight if... if you want.

31:45.699 --> 31:48.818
My friends have been turned into
agents of Satan,

31:48.819 --> 31:51.418
and you're coming on to me?
You are unbelievable!

31:51.419 --> 31:54.218
I can't do anything right
by you, can I?

31:54.219 --> 31:56.738
Oh! That's hot coffee!

31:56.739 --> 32:00.739
It's warm coffee.

32:08.379 --> 32:09.418
Jessica.

32:09.419 --> 32:11.538
It's Rudy. He's one of them.

32:11.539 --> 32:13.258
It's... it's Rudy Two.

32:13.259 --> 32:17.259
Are you in there? Rudy One's
turned into an agent of Satan.

32:19.019 --> 32:20.658
I just... I just don't
know what to do.

32:20.659 --> 32:24.659
I thought you might be in there
with the handsome barman.

32:25.419 --> 32:29.419
Jess?

32:31.779 --> 32:34.298
You all right?

32:34.299 --> 32:36.298
So, Finn's got this book
on satanic rites,

32:36.299 --> 32:38.778
and it says the only way
to drive Satan out of anybody

32:38.779 --> 32:41.138
is to douse them in holy water
and you've got to...

32:41.139 --> 32:44.218
You've got to read
this little passage here.

32:44.219 --> 32:46.898
That's great, only
I'm fresh out of holy water.

32:46.899 --> 32:50.498
Well, I went to the church
on the way here, so...

32:50.499 --> 32:52.818
Sprite? No.

32:52.819 --> 32:55.458
No, it's holy water. I
filled it up from the font, guys,

32:55.459 --> 32:57.579
on the way here.

32:59.419 --> 33:03.419
Finn and Rudy said they were going
to the bar later on tonight, so...

33:04.259 --> 33:06.618
I suppose you want me to help you?

33:06.619 --> 33:09.618
Yeah.

33:09.619 --> 33:13.619
Oh.

33:30.699 --> 33:34.458
I'm thinking about getting
a raven as a pet.

33:34.459 --> 33:36.298
What?

33:36.299 --> 33:39.498
I feel stupid asking.
Is it that raven to replace me?

33:39.499 --> 33:43.458
Bros before hoes... and ravens.

33:43.459 --> 33:47.459
You're flippin' cool, Finn.
Do you know that?

33:48.899 --> 33:51.378
You're not going in
there on your own.

33:51.379 --> 33:54.138
If I go on my own,
Finn will let me get close to him.

33:54.139 --> 33:57.418
She's right.

33:57.419 --> 33:59.818
Do you know how to use this?

33:59.819 --> 34:02.339
Bullets come out of this end?

34:47.619 --> 34:49.378
Hiya, Jess.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.818
Can I talk to you alone?

34:50.819 --> 34:54.098
Yeah, course. Step into my office.

34:54.099 --> 34:58.099
It's not really an office.
It's... it's the bar.

35:00.419 --> 35:04.419
Drink?

35:05.179 --> 35:09.058
Uh!

35:09.059 --> 35:13.059
Get back. Stay back!

35:24.339 --> 35:27.658
Let the Holy Cross be my light.
Let not the dragon be my guide.

35:27.659 --> 35:31.658
Step back, impure spirit.
What you offer me is evil.

35:31.659 --> 35:34.378
I exorcise you in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

35:34.379 --> 35:36.658
I free you from
the snares of the devil.

35:36.659 --> 35:40.659
Get thee back, Satan! Get thee back,
Satan! Get thee back, Satan!

35:47.939 --> 35:50.458
That's brilliant, innit?

35:50.459 --> 35:54.459
"Get thee back, Satan!
Get thee back, Satan!"

35:59.819 --> 36:02.218
Holy water?

36:02.219 --> 36:04.978
It's Sprite.

36:04.979 --> 36:08.178
This isn't you. This is me.

36:08.179 --> 36:11.738
I'm just improved. Version 2.0.

36:11.739 --> 36:14.858
Version 2.0 is a dick.
I like the original.

36:14.859 --> 36:18.018
Didn't want to fuck me,
though, did you? Don't.

36:18.019 --> 36:20.378
You'll come round.

36:20.379 --> 36:24.379
First I'm going to cut off Alex from
the bar's cock and feed it to him.

36:24.819 --> 36:27.818
Don't come any closer.
Or what? You're going to shoot me

36:27.819 --> 36:30.299
in my cute and monkey-ish
little face?

36:34.219 --> 36:37.018
Go on, then.

36:37.019 --> 36:39.138
Do it.

36:39.139 --> 36:40.778
Shoot me.

36:40.779 --> 36:43.379
Do it!

37:01.139 --> 37:03.978
I'm really sorry.

37:03.979 --> 37:05.898
About what?

37:05.899 --> 37:09.018
I'm one of them.

37:09.019 --> 37:13.019
Ow! What was that?

37:20.339 --> 37:22.258
Ooh!

37:22.259 --> 37:26.259
Uh. Oh.

37:26.779 --> 37:29.219
Oh!

38:09.539 --> 38:13.539
How fucking cool is that?
It is very cool.

38:13.619 --> 38:17.619
I'm going to call him Nigel.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.819
Big mistake, my friend.

38:33.939 --> 38:36.298
Isn't it a bit weird
that we're agents of Satan

38:36.299 --> 38:39.018
but we're still
on community service?

38:39.019 --> 38:42.338
We'll burn the probation worker
at the stake after lunch.

38:42.339 --> 38:46.098
There's something
I want to show you first.

38:46.099 --> 38:48.179
What is it?

38:53.219 --> 38:57.219
Let me see.

39:01.099 --> 39:03.019
You did all this for me?

39:05.539 --> 39:08.098
Just because I'm Satan's
chief agent on earth,

39:08.099 --> 39:12.099
doesn't mean I can't be romantic.

39:16.339 --> 39:20.178
I love you.

39:20.179 --> 39:23.498
I always have.

39:23.499 --> 39:27.499
And now I'm going to fuck you
and make you a bride of Satan.

39:30.779 --> 39:32.619
Look forward to it.

39:36.299 --> 39:38.498
Oh!

39:38.499 --> 39:40.738
Mm! Mm, mm!

39:40.739 --> 39:44.739
I'm doing this for you.

40:03.499 --> 40:05.138
It was the lung transplant.

40:05.139 --> 40:09.139
I've got the power to
fuck powers out of people.

40:09.259 --> 40:13.058
Look, I know you can't forgive me
for shagging that girl.

40:13.059 --> 40:14.578
And I'm not asking you to.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.258
And I could say that it will
never happen again, but it would.

40:17.259 --> 40:19.938
There's always going to
be some other girl.

40:19.939 --> 40:23.939
I hate myself for what I
did to you and I'm sorry.

40:27.059 --> 40:31.059
But now I've got the chance
to... to use my cock for good.

40:31.939 --> 40:35.939
And I want to save you.
I'm doing this for you.

40:36.659 --> 40:40.659
I'm sorry.

40:55.579 --> 40:57.899
Is that what I think it is?

41:05.699 --> 41:09.699
Sorry.

41:14.059 --> 41:16.018
You fucked me?
Do you think I enjoyed it?

41:16.019 --> 41:17.058
Probably.

41:17.059 --> 41:19.738
I was shagging the devil out of you.
And it was the only way.

41:19.739 --> 41:23.739
And I was doing it for her.

41:26.939 --> 41:30.939
Hiya, Jess.

41:31.219 --> 41:32.499
Mm.

42:01.619 --> 42:03.098
Ooh.

42:03.099 --> 42:05.618
This is for you.

42:05.619 --> 42:09.619
But you... Hang on.

42:10.339 --> 42:12.058
How kind. What... what is it?

42:12.059 --> 42:14.098
I knit the future.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.298
Ah.

42:16.299 --> 42:20.299
Thanks.

42:24.899 --> 42:28.898
So, these people here in these
orange jump suits, is that us?

42:28.899 --> 42:31.338
I think so.

42:31.339 --> 42:34.458
Are we going to become
proper superheroes?

42:34.459 --> 42:38.459
Ah!

42:47.579 --> 42:49.978
Did you get community service
for fucking him up the arse

42:49.979 --> 42:51.698
or breaking into
the community centre?

42:51.699 --> 42:53.258
Breaking and entering.

42:53.259 --> 42:56.298
Breaking and entering
his sphincter. Boom!

42:56.299 --> 42:58.498
We all know what happened!

42:58.499 --> 43:02.018
I think we're all mature enough to
brush it under the carpet,

43:02.019 --> 43:03.178
as far as it will go.

43:03.179 --> 43:07.179
Not just under the carpet -
under the underlay under the carpet.

43:07.699 --> 43:11.699
Where things go when there's
no need to speak about them

43:11.979 --> 43:15.979
or think about them ever again.

43:16.659 --> 43:19.738
So, how comes he didn't
take your telekinesis?

43:19.739 --> 43:22.218
I guess it's last in, first out.
Of his sphincter! Boom!

43:22.219 --> 43:25.218
I thought we weren't
going to talk about it?

43:25.219 --> 43:27.818
Sorry. Sorry.

43:27.819 --> 43:29.338
Eugh!

43:29.339 --> 43:30.538
What? I just... Shit, man.

43:30.539 --> 43:33.258
I don't know. I keep thinking
about you and him. It's horrid.

43:33.259 --> 43:36.378
Oh, for... What happened to
brushing it under the underlay

43:36.379 --> 43:37.538
under the carpet?

43:37.539 --> 43:39.058
I live in the flat below, Finn,

43:39.059 --> 43:41.058
and I've drilled
an hole in the ceiling.

43:41.059 --> 43:42.858
I can see everything, mate, every...

43:42.859 --> 43:44.578
Horrible.

43:44.579 --> 43:48.579
Like a frigging
giant shagging a dwarf.

43:49.019 --> 43:53.019
Boom.

44:16.259 --> 44:18.138
Oh, shit! It's my dad!

44:18.139 --> 44:20.218
Dude, your mum and dad
are proper going for it.

44:20.219 --> 44:21.898
That's not my mum!

44:21.899 --> 44:23.218
Please, don't.

44:23.219 --> 44:25.898
I will find you and I will hurt you.

44:25.899 --> 44:28.178
Mum has a right to know
what's going on here.

44:28.179 --> 44:30.298
I won't do it!

44:30.299 --> 44:34.299
So, there's this stuff going
on with our parents, and...

44:35.299 --> 44:37.858
..he won't let me in.
He won't listen to me.

44:37.859 --> 44:41.859
Why don't you just leave him
the fuck alone, yeah?

44:42.659 --> 44:46.659
I'm going to shank you!

44:46.899 --> 44:50.899
He's burning her clothes.
Why's he burning her clothes?

44:50.924 --> 45:33.931
