00:01.000 --> 00:02.200
Unless you go
to work tomorrow,

00:02.280 --> 00:05.318
I'm gonna be forced to do something
very bad to your mother.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.440
Give me your phone.

00:06.520 --> 00:10.275
I rigged Signal's API to beam
GPS coords so we can share locations.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.000
<i>My whole life is
ruined because of you.</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:15.640
All you deserve is
pure and utter agony.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.439
<i>Olivia was
Susan Jacobs's contact.</i>

00:17.520 --> 00:18.590
<i>She's an addict.</i>

00:18.680 --> 00:20.512
<i>If she gets caught using,
she loses her kid.</i>

00:20.600 --> 00:21.636
I'm not like most people.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.040
I'm starting to
pick up on that.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.120
<i>My mom got killed.</i>

00:24.200 --> 00:25.475
Murdered, actually.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.313
<i>Olivia's access
isn't good enough.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:28.696
You know why
we came back here, right?

00:28.720 --> 00:30.016
<i>So you could be
king of New York.</i>

00:30.040 --> 00:31.816
<i>And in order for
our kingdom to be built,</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:33.274
<i>I need
a brilliant architect.</i>

00:33.360 --> 00:34.476
I'm trying to help him.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.040
You're trying
to destroy me.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.839
<i>I'm done
talking to you.</i>

00:37.920 --> 00:39.296
<i>One of your patients
hacked me.</i>

00:39.320 --> 00:41.755
- Krista.
- I don't feel safe around you!

00:41.840 --> 00:43.593
She knows something
I gotta know.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.000
It's time we talk.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.918
I'm gonna tell you a story.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.758
A story of
a true Xmas miracle.

00:55.760 --> 00:59.515
This is the tale of
a bully and a lil' bitch.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.108
I'm talking about
a mean, nasty bully

01:05.600 --> 01:07.796
and a scrawny-ass
lil' bitch.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.912
This bully would pick on

01:10.000 --> 01:11.878
the lil' bitch
every day after school.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.953
If lil' bitch had cash,
lil' bitch got robbed.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.632
If lil' bitch bowed up,
lil' bitch got stomped.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.592
Point I'm trying
to make here is,

01:26.680 --> 01:30.469
this bully owned that bitch
like a Lincoln Continental.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.516
But something happened
to change it all.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.076
On this Xmas of our tale,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.151
lil' bitch got lucky
with the gifts.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.949
See,

01:43.080 --> 01:45.436
something lil' bitch loved
more than anything,

01:45.520 --> 01:49.355
before family,
God, and country,

01:51.080 --> 01:52.196
was baseball.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.599
Loved the shit out of it.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.553
Well, on this Xmas morning

02:01.280 --> 02:03.237
when he got out
his lil' bedroom

02:03.880 --> 02:06.031
and looked under
his lil' tree,

02:07.600 --> 02:08.750
guess what he found?

02:12.680 --> 02:17.755
An Easton Magnum
aluminum baseball bat.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.798
Lil' bitch grabbed
that bat

02:22.200 --> 02:23.919
and went right
outside to play.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.113
Didn't even take the bow off,
he was so excited.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.479
And there he was,
on the corner ball field,

02:31.560 --> 02:34.792
hittin' balls like
he was Sammy Sosa, when

02:37.120 --> 02:39.430
his bully comes up,

02:40.360 --> 02:41.999
eyeing that bat.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.156
And just as the bully
made his way up to him,

02:49.320 --> 02:51.960
without any warning...

02:55.360 --> 02:56.635
Blood!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.959
Fuckin' everywhere.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.190
Blood on the ground,
blood on lil' bitch.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.672
Blood dripping down the bow
still wrapped around that bat.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.953
Lil' bitch knocked every tooth
outta that muh'fucker's head.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.993
Cracked his skull open,
popped his eyeball out on home plate.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.070
All because lil' bitch
saw the truth.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.355
That bat may have been
made to play ball,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.276
but that wasn't its purpose.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.316
Nuh-uh.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.115
In that moment,
in lil' bitch's hands,

03:45.440 --> 03:48.194
it was there to break
this nigga's head open.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.440
See, Ms. Krista,

03:57.480 --> 04:00.632
we all have a purpose
in this world

04:01.640 --> 04:05.111
and it's our lot in life
to wait for the cosmos

04:05.400 --> 04:07.631
to reveal what that is.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.517
But you don't have
to look no more.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.556
'Cause for you,
that day has come.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.195
Wanna know why?

04:35.120 --> 04:37.077
I'm gonna break Elliot.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.640
And you gonna be
my aluminum bat.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.352
I'm, uh... I'm on my way
to Olivia's now.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.016
<i>How are you
gonna get to her boss?</i>

05:04.040 --> 05:06.839
We still need his login credentials
to transfer the money.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.432
<i>Don't worry about it,
I have a plan.</i>

05:10.920 --> 05:13.389
<i>Did the proxy hack
at Virtual Realty check out?</i>

05:14.320 --> 05:15.515
Yeah, we're good.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.796
I'm seeing all the unencrypted
network traffic.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.710
What about the venue
for this Deus Group shindig?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.240
Do we know
where it's going down?

05:23.040 --> 05:25.635
Price sent me the location.
It should be in your inbox.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.313
<i>There's a hotel across the street
that we should work out of.</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:34.195
<i>Are you there?</i>

05:36.160 --> 05:37.276
<i>Darlene?</i>

05:39.480 --> 05:40.516
Yeah.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.473
The other day,

05:45.680 --> 05:49.196
when I said that I should never
have let you back into my life,

05:50.480 --> 05:51.800
<i>I was an asshole.</i>

05:53.880 --> 05:55.155
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

05:57.320 --> 06:00.074
You still have my Signal mod
running on your phone, right?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.475
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

06:04.160 --> 06:06.516
Just be careful, okay?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.069
Keep your phone on you
so I can see where you are.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.040
I don't wanna
lose you again.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.720
Thank you.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.474
Hey, I...
I gotta go.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.590
Elli...

06:39.280 --> 06:41.590
Long time no see, cuz.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.233
Where do I know
this place from?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.914
Do you have it?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.879
Of course I got it, bruh.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.834
Under the table.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.750
Where you goin'?

07:05.160 --> 07:06.196
I gotta go.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.376
Damn, you just gonna
leave like that, dude?

07:08.400 --> 07:09.640
I thought we was
gonna catch up.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.158
Sorry, man,
I got shit to do.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.318
Listen, just so you know,
I'm full-time freelance now.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.797
My only loyalty is
to the almighty paper.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.590
So, hang on to my number.
Should you need anything,

07:23.200 --> 07:24.554
you know I'm your guy.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.109
You be strange now,

07:27.200 --> 07:29.078
but don't be a stranger,
know what I mean?

07:33.960 --> 07:34.996
Peace, Elli.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.800
We don't
have to do this.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.473
We can find a way
to talk to her...

07:54.560 --> 07:55.994
And if she says no?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.750
Then we reason
with her...

07:57.840 --> 07:59.559
And if she
still says no?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.512
We don't have time
for taking risks.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.960
This is the only way.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.949
What you're about to do
is crossing a line.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.715
Well, it's a little late for that,
don't you think?

08:15.560 --> 08:16.630
<i>He's right.</i>

08:16.920 --> 08:19.958
<i>We used to have a code,
lines we would not cross,</i>

08:20.040 --> 08:21.554
<i>parameters we set.</i>

08:21.840 --> 08:24.116
<i>But those seem to have been
seriously modified.</i>

08:24.840 --> 08:26.035
<i>Question is,</i>

08:26.520 --> 08:28.398
<i>can we bring
those boundaries back?</i>

08:28.480 --> 08:30.870
<i>Or is it like he said,
too late?</i>

08:33.320 --> 08:35.039
Two large
peppermint mochas.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.630
What were you doing
in Pike's Hollow this morning?

08:40.640 --> 08:41.994
How did you get in here?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.435
Where's your brother?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.440
Did you
take him somewhere?

08:50.360 --> 08:51.680
Is he still in the city?

09:00.280 --> 09:01.714
Okay.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.877
Fuck, Darlene,
you should have kept driving.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.470
Who are you calling?

09:14.240 --> 09:16.197
You can't call this
in to the FBI.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.016
If the Dark Army finds out
about that crime scene,

09:18.040 --> 09:19.136
they're gonna send someone...

09:19.160 --> 09:20.480
They already did.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.590
Have a seat.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.071
<i>A guy
who continually talks</i>

09:29.160 --> 09:31.391
<i>to an invisible entity
that isn't there.</i>

09:31.640 --> 09:33.016
<i>Has arguments with him.</i>

09:33.040 --> 09:35.350
<i>The invisible entity
interrupts him sometimes.</i>

09:35.440 --> 09:36.874
<i>This is Exedor.</i>

09:37.200 --> 09:39.336
<i>And that's what John Mathias
is like. He doesn'tjust...</i>

09:39.360 --> 09:40.714
- Clorox.
<i>- Market.</i>

09:41.280 --> 09:42.475
How may I help you?

09:42.600 --> 09:43.716
<i>I have her.</i>

09:44.160 --> 09:45.389
Ah.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.590
Well done.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.869
And her brother?

09:49.520 --> 09:51.113
No, and she's not
giving him up.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Uh-huh.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.513
Well, that's not great.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.354
Keep her close.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.954
Let me run it up
the flagpole.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.440
<i>I'll call you back in a bit.</i>

10:03.760 --> 10:05.672
<i>...return of
a biblical prophet.</i>

10:05.760 --> 10:09.720
<i>John Mathias is preaching death and
repentance before the second coming,</i>

10:09.840 --> 10:12.056
<i>- and those who are not the chosen...</i>
- Hello, sweetheart.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.440
<i>...are going to be
horribly killed.</i>

10:19.080 --> 10:21.231
I brought
peppermint mochas.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.149
They said it was
Christmas in a cup.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.071
Well, it is
indeed Christmas.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.316
That's very sweet.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.000
Do you wanna come in?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.316
Yeah.

10:50.840 --> 10:51.876
Okay.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.433
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound...

11:17.120 --> 11:18.474
...a little crazy.

11:22.760 --> 11:23.989
What's up?

11:28.080 --> 11:29.480
It's about
your clients.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.190
My clients?

11:34.880 --> 11:36.872
At Cyprus National Bank.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.272
I never told you
where I work.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.997
A bank that primarily does
business with the Deus Group.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.949
Oh...

11:59.840 --> 12:01.115
What the fuck is this?

12:01.360 --> 12:04.956
They're a criminal enterprise
that uses their power and wealth

12:05.200 --> 12:07.476
to run the world
without anyone knowing it.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.776
Okay, I don't know
why you're...

12:10.800 --> 12:11.950
Tiananmen Square.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.399
Civil War in the Congo.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.233
Both Iraq wars.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.954
The paramilitary massacre
in El Salado.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.514
The Cyber Bombings.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.793
That's not even
their top five.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.956
Okay...

12:32.880 --> 12:34.599
You're really starting
to scare me.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.393
Tell me what you're doing.
Why... Why do you know where I work?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.076
I hacked you.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.310
Excuse me?

12:46.760 --> 12:47.910
I hacked you.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.435
Why?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.797
I need you to do
something for me.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.757
What... What is this?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.270
I need you to make
one phone call. To your boss.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.391
I'm already on
their proxy server,

13:05.480 --> 13:08.439
I just need him to log in
so I can swipe his credentials...

13:09.760 --> 13:12.320
I know this doesn't make sense
to you right now.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.639
But, trust me, Olivia,

13:16.760 --> 13:17.955
they're using you.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.149
They're using me?

13:22.320 --> 13:23.390
They are.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.235
But I can stop them.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.912
I can stop them
once and for all.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.116
All I need is
one phone call from you.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.230
Get out.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.910
Don't do this.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.320
Are you
fucking kidding me?

13:43.760 --> 13:45.353
This conversation's over.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.994
Get the fuck out.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.470
Now!

14:22.600 --> 14:24.592
What happens
if you fail a drug test?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.549
What did you say?

14:31.360 --> 14:33.397
I know about
your custody battle.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.158
If you test positive
for oxy...

14:40.240 --> 14:43.039
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm eight years clean.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.114
No, you're not.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.515
You drugged me?

15:19.880 --> 15:21.758
I had to make sure
you would listen.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.037
You're gonna
call your boss in Cyprus.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.272
You're gonna get him to log in
to the bank website, and that's it.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.349
Then I'm gone.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.159
If you don't do
what I say,

15:43.800 --> 15:45.234
you'll lose your son.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.874
Why are you doing this?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.199
I was running out of time.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.236
This was the fastest way
to convince you.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.713
This was taken one mile

16:21.800 --> 16:25.396
from where the van following
Mr. Alderson was found burned.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.639
We have his sister,

16:28.200 --> 16:29.998
but we're still
searching for him.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.193
The minute we find him,

16:34.560 --> 16:35.789
I think...

16:39.080 --> 16:40.560
You think what?

16:42.720 --> 16:45.599
It's time, Minister Zhang.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.919
He's too much
of a liability.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.400
You're being foolish.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.834
If we kill him, his shipping hack
dies with him.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.756
We have the Deus Group
meeting tonight.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.736
Think about
what you're saying.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.639
The entire membership
will be there, it's too risky...

17:00.720 --> 17:04.156
I will not get this close,
only to watch it slip away again.

17:06.119 --> 17:10.512
I want you to locate Mr. Alderson
and bring him in.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.599
He should see the full potential of
what we're working towards.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.676
It's time he learns
we're on the same side.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.874
- Placemat.
<i>- Bandit.</i>

17:42.960 --> 17:44.713
<i>How's everything
over there?</i>

17:45.800 --> 17:46.950
Fine.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.720
<i>Good news and bad news.</i>

17:48.800 --> 17:50.632
<i>The higher-ups want Elliot,
not his sister.</i>

17:50.720 --> 17:53.030
<i>I don't suppose she's mentioned
where he is yet?</i>

17:54.200 --> 17:55.475
She wouldn't do that.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.398
I heard her talking to him
earlier, though.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.119
I can get his location
off her phone.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.999
<i>Hmm. Interesting.</i>

18:02.240 --> 18:03.833
<i>And you have her phone,
I assume.</i>

18:03.920 --> 18:06.310
Yeah, I got it right here.
So, we don't need her.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.110
<i>Fantastic.</i>

18:08.480 --> 18:11.279
<i>Well, then I'll be there with my team
to collect the phone.</i>

18:12.840 --> 18:14.638
- And her?
<i>- Kill her.</i>

18:26.640 --> 18:27.756
What?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.594
<i>You said it yourself, we don't need her.
Cleaner this way.</i>

18:35.520 --> 18:38.194
<i>You can handle that,
right?</i>

18:38.720 --> 18:39.870
Mmm-hmm.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.873
<i>Because I recall the last time
you didn't feel 100...</i>

18:42.960 --> 18:44.110
No.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.320
- I'm fine.
<i>- I'm just saying,</i>

18:47.400 --> 18:50.154
<i>if you don't feel 100%,
like last time,</i>

18:50.240 --> 18:51.560
<i>you should let me know
right now</i>

18:51.640 --> 18:52.835
<i>so I can set aside the time</i>

18:52.920 --> 18:54.416
<i>to kill your mother
and your entire family.</i>

18:54.440 --> 18:55.476
No.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.438
- I can handle it.
<i>- Great!</i>

18:59.840 --> 19:02.150
<i>I'll be there at 3:30,
on the dot.</i>

19:02.880 --> 19:04.473
<i>Make sure it's done
by then.</i>

19:06.720 --> 19:07.790
What?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.589
What did they say?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.350
Fuck! What the fuck?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.551
Wait, wait! Fucking wait!

19:34.160 --> 19:35.196
Get up!

19:39.560 --> 19:41.597
What the fuck
are you doing?

19:41.720 --> 19:43.359
I'm keeping my family safe.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.510
On your knees!

19:51.360 --> 19:52.840
So, this is it, then?

19:54.480 --> 19:56.915
They tell you to kill me,
and you're just gonna do it?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.176
Your phone gives them Elliot's location.
So, they don't need you.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.429
This is crazy!

20:00.520 --> 20:02.910
This isn't you, Dom!
You don't need to fucking do this!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.912
I can't believe you have the balls
to say that.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.150
You ruined my life.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.560
I did. I'll own that, okay?
But that doesn't make you this.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.075
You don't just fucking shoot
people in cold blood!

20:11.160 --> 20:13.755
- I'm here because of you.
- I know...

20:13.840 --> 20:15.479
- You did this to me!
- I know!

20:17.200 --> 20:18.395
Okay? You were right.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.473
Okay? I was wrong.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.032
Give me a chance to make it right.
I can get you out of this.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.716
There's no way out.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.230
- I have a plan.
- You think I give a shit about your plan?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.596
We are gonna take down
the Dark Army once and for all.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.160
It's happening tonight.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.154
It's too late.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.436
Please, Dom.
It's not too late.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.118
No. It has to be like this.
There's not enough time. It's too late.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.590
Dom, listen to me.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.836
They're coming at 3:30.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.957
Listen to me.
I know I fucked up, okay?

20:46.040 --> 20:47.360
But it's not too late.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.230
If you let me go,
I can stop this, okay?

20:50.360 --> 20:52.795
I swear to God,
if you just let me go!

20:53.040 --> 20:54.269
- I'm sorry.
- Please...

20:56.920 --> 20:58.513
No, no, no, please...

20:58.600 --> 21:01.320
Don't be sorry, Dom.
Don't be. Don't be.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.920
Don't be sorry, Dom. Okay?

21:03.040 --> 21:04.918
Please, Dom.
Don't be sorry.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.040
You don't need to do this.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.150
You are a good person!

21:07.280 --> 21:09.272
- This isn't you!
- Shut up!

21:15.840 --> 21:18.514
Shit! Shit. Shit.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
Shit.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.113
How soon can he
get back to me?

21:26.240 --> 21:27.640
It's urgent, yes.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.713
I know, but it's regarding
Mr. Kuklachev, he'll wanna know.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.790
Okay. Great.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.389
Merry Christmas.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.434
How long do you
think it'll be?

21:49.520 --> 21:50.590
Fuck you.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.271
My life is over,
I want you to know that.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.990
You just have to talk to him
and then I'll go.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.513
Nothing will be
traced to you.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.960
And you think that's it, huh?

22:12.560 --> 22:14.233
You just drugged
an addict.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.309
You'll get through it.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.878
You arrogant
piece of shit.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.630
Maybe you can have a slip and it's not
the end of the world, but I can't.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.320
It destroys me.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.274
So, fuck you.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.997
Maybe you should have thought
about that before you worked for them.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.919
What's that
supposed to mean?

22:45.120 --> 22:47.271
Offshore bank in Cyprus.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.711
The kind of money
that goes through there.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.400
Come on.
You're not dumb.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.077
I'm sure a part of you
has always known.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.278
You chose to look
the other way.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.357
My choices are
none of your business.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.716
I get it.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.076
You needed a job.
They were paying well.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.635
That's how they do it,
that's their business model.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.759
They back everyone
into a corner,

23:14.840 --> 23:16.160
until all that's left

23:16.240 --> 23:18.311
is for us to
compromise ourselves.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.832
That's why what I'm doing
has to be done.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.520
They're hurting you,

23:26.200 --> 23:28.192
just like they're hurting
all of us.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.072
The only one hurting me
right now is you.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.671
I wonder how many people
you've had to hurt

23:38.760 --> 23:39.955
to get what you want.

23:41.640 --> 23:42.640
Hmm?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.758
How many
has it been, Elliot?

23:50.880 --> 23:53.873
How many people have had to
suffer because of you?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.320
Was it worth it?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.235
I'm a mess.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.720
Can I use the bathroom?

24:29.040 --> 24:30.190
Go ahead.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.310
So, was fucking me part of the plan,
or was that just a happy accident?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.469
It was an accident.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.029
That's sweet.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.595
It's almost done.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.716
Once her boss calls back,
we'll get what we need and go.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.400
This would have
all been simpler

25:34.440 --> 25:35.954
if she wasn't
so deep in denial

25:36.040 --> 25:37.554
about who
she's working for.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.356
<i>There it is,</i>

25:42.480 --> 25:44.119
<i>that sense of dread.</i>

25:46.640 --> 25:49.838
<i>It only happens when you cross a line
you didn't even know existed.</i>

25:52.000 --> 25:53.912
<i>Maybe that dread
is a good thing.</i>

26:00.600 --> 26:03.115
<i>After all, when you realize
you've crossed a line,</i>

26:06.560 --> 26:08.517
<i>that means
you still had one.</i>

26:11.920 --> 26:14.594
<i>But when those crossed lines
are all behind you,</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:17.232
<i>up ahead is only darkness.</i>

26:20.960 --> 26:24.715
He has insomnia,
social anxiety.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.678
I... I don't know
what else to tell you.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.836
Morphine addiction,
jail time, dead daddy.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.435
You're giving me
the knockoffs, girl.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.032
I want the brand name.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.834
Please let me go.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.160
Whatever you're looking for,
I don't have it.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.597
I know the two of you
had a special relationship.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.520
Special?

26:55.360 --> 26:56.680
He hacked me.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.513
He threatened
my last boyfriend.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.034
He threatened me.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.600
You know,
I had to stop seeing him

27:03.680 --> 27:04.909
because he scared me
so much...

27:05.000 --> 27:06.559
You weren't scared of him!

27:07.440 --> 27:08.920
You loved his ass!

27:14.640 --> 27:16.916
I saw the look
on your face.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.600
Don't lie to me.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.994
This isn't going to work.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.674
Your outbursts.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.676
Just because you were
bullied as a kid,

27:32.720 --> 27:34.677
because people hurt you,

27:35.760 --> 27:39.515
until that day you swung a bat
and learned how to hurt them back,

27:41.120 --> 27:43.351
doesn't mean it's
going to work with me.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.030
Wait a minute.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.792
Wait a fuckin' second.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.959
Ms. Krista, are you...

28:08.520 --> 28:10.273
Are you calling me
a lil' bitch?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.712
Yo, Peanuts,

28:17.600 --> 28:19.671
you hear that?
What'd she call me?

28:20.600 --> 28:22.000
She called you
a lil' bitch.

28:22.760 --> 28:23.989
Hey, Javi,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.317
you hear her
call me a lil' bitch?

28:27.680 --> 28:28.955
That's what I heard.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.072
See? That's why
you're good!

28:40.920 --> 28:43.640
Not even my bitch
can call me a lil' bitch.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.798
Oh, my God!

28:51.480 --> 28:52.800
- Who's that?
- Jason...

28:57.960 --> 28:58.996
Jason, huh?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.635
That's your boy?

29:04.720 --> 29:06.916
Maybe we should
bring him in here.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.549
Maybe that's what
will get you going.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.032
Babe? You in there?

29:14.520 --> 29:15.954
How 'bout that,
Ms. Krista?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.912
We gonna have
one big merry merry?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.912
Krista?

29:29.520 --> 29:31.637
I was able to
stop the bleeding.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.834
You're gonna be okay.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.355
I'm sorry.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.519
I don't believe you.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.952
You said the people
I work for...

30:46.920 --> 30:49.560
...they were behind
the massacre in El Salado.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.594
My mom died there.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.596
I know.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.196
Olivia.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.759
I can stop them.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.390
Hi.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.280
I'm sorry to bother you
on a holiday,

31:51.040 --> 31:54.477
but Mr. Kuklachev needs
the authorization to transfer funds.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.393
You don't see the request?

32:04.640 --> 32:05.790
Are you sure?

32:22.360 --> 32:25.512
Okay, that's strange,
he said it was urgent.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.953
Maybe he
changed his mind.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.036
I'll just...

32:31.520 --> 32:35.196
I'll just check back with him
and get back to you.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.875
Okay, thanks.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.673
Merry Christmas
to you, too.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.790
I'll wipe all the traces of you
and your boss's involvement.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.037
Nothing will be linked
back to you.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.989
You know,
I may work for monsters...

33:08.600 --> 33:09.920
...but you are one.

33:12.640 --> 33:16.111
And you're the worst kind
because you don't even know it.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.189
Oh, damn.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.911
Your boy's upset
you didn't let him in.

34:02.840 --> 34:03.990
A'ight.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.556
Now...

34:14.159 --> 34:16.436
Before your boy came and went,

34:16.880 --> 34:18.518
you were calling me
a lil' bitch.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.199
Chill, girl.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.273
I didn't take no offense.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.670
In fact,

34:28.440 --> 34:29.476
this was my bad

34:29.560 --> 34:31.136
'cause I didn't tell you
the whole story.

34:31.159 --> 34:35.359
See, I was just explaining
your role to you.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.080
That you my bat.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.831
But that bat ain't the end
of the story.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.110
Nah.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.436
So, after being beaten
within an inch of his life

35:01.200 --> 35:04.113
by that badass lil' bitch,

35:06.120 --> 35:08.430
the bully woke up
in the hospital.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.960
And it was right then when lil'
bitch walked in.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.639
Like the fuckin' ghost
of Xmas past.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.232
Bully sees him,
starts crying.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.595
I mean,
this nigga was scared.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.280
He must've thought that boy had
come to finish him off.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.600
But you know
what happened?

35:32.320 --> 35:36.394
Lil' bitch just walked
right up to his bully's bed...

35:41.480 --> 35:43.153
...and held his hand.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.838
Yup, he held his hand

35:50.400 --> 35:51.800
just like so.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.917
Real soft and gentle like.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.831
And then he got real close.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.120
He looks at his bully,

36:08.680 --> 36:10.478
all sniffling and crying.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.794
He looked at him and said...

36:17.800 --> 36:19.359
..."I see you now."

36:25.800 --> 36:28.395
Lil' bitch showed up
when no one else would.

36:29.200 --> 36:33.194
He saw his bully
like no one else could.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.280
And that was all it took.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.880
And, Ms. Krista,

36:39.800 --> 36:41.792
from that moment on,

36:42.360 --> 36:44.750
he owned that bully for life.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.194
Now, if I wanna own Elliot,

36:52.280 --> 36:53.873
I don't just gotta break him.

36:54.360 --> 36:58.479
Me and Elliot are linked
on a spiritual plane.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.276
I got to come at him

37:00.360 --> 37:01.794
on the same level
I find myself.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.190
And... And breaking him
only gets you so far.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.957
I gotta break him
so I can build him up.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.269
I need to wound his soul,

37:09.360 --> 37:11.033
so I can be the one
to heal him.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.316
That is how
you own a nigga.

37:16.600 --> 37:20.879
Now, the next words out of your mouth
have to be exactly what I want.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.520
Not for my sake,
but for yours.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.231
And for your boy Jason,

37:26.320 --> 37:28.755
who lives up on
1404 Jay Street.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.199
Now, you know what I want.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.114
You got to give it to me.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.956
You do that, I got no reason
not to turn you loose.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.240
Look me in my eye.

38:04.840 --> 38:05.956
Trust me.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.390
Go to the filing cabinet
in my office.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.791
There's a folder
in the bottom drawer.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.319
Go to the tab that says
September 2015.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.833
Look for Elliot's name.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.959
What am I gonna
find there?

39:16.360 --> 39:17.635
Mr. Robot.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.596
What's that?

39:25.880 --> 39:29.920
That is how
you'll break him.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.439
Oh, my head hurts.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.039
I thought you were
gonna kill me.

40:10.160 --> 40:11.435
They gave me an hour.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.275
How long has it been?

40:22.480 --> 40:24.039
Just unlock your phone.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.191
All they want
is Elliot's location.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.998
- I can't.
- You can.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.953
What would you do
if it was your family?

40:33.360 --> 40:34.430
I'm doing it.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.712
You know,
that night we spent together...

40:50.880 --> 40:53.873
I know you probably think of it
as the worst night of your life.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.671
The night all the shit
went to shit.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.120
But when I think
about it, it was...

41:01.160 --> 41:02.276
Don't!

41:03.880 --> 41:05.075
...nice.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.120
The last time I remember
actually feeling good.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.633
You were just using me.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.798
You know it was
more than that.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.469
Look,

41:33.360 --> 41:35.317
whatever you have to do,
I get it.

41:36.760 --> 41:37.910
Okay? But just...

41:39.080 --> 41:40.833
Just at least
believe that.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.470
I'm outta time.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
Get up.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.956
Where are we going?

42:13.040 --> 42:14.235
Come on. Get up.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.313
- Where are we going?
- Up.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.675
Come on. Let's go.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.976
You got the jump on me, and before I knew
what was happening, it was over.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.275
What are you
talking about?

42:27.080 --> 42:28.992
Take it and
make it quick.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.136
- You want me to shoot you?
- It's the only way.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.936
Come on, we're running out of time.
You have to kill me.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.953
I'm not fucking killing you, okay?
Let's go, we can make a run for it...

42:37.040 --> 42:39.600
If they show up and we're gone,
my family's dead.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.189
Don't you get it?

42:41.520 --> 42:44.433
My life puts everyone
I love in danger.

42:45.160 --> 42:47.072
This won't stop
until I'm dead.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.239
I'm not gonna
fucking kill you!

42:49.320 --> 42:51.152
I'd do it myself
if I could.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.256
I've thought about it every day
for the past two months,

42:53.280 --> 42:54.475
but I can't do it.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.034
I can't do it.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.998
Please, Darlene.
Just pull the fucking trigger.

42:58.120 --> 43:00.112
- I can't.
- Just pull the fucking trigger!

43:00.200 --> 43:02.112
- Dom, please.
- Pull the fucking trigger!

43:02.200 --> 43:03.600
- I can't.
- Do it!

43:10.000 --> 43:11.275
Dominique?

43:17.640 --> 43:20.838
Well. Now,
I was not expecting this.

43:23.120 --> 43:25.919
I'm stunned,
I must say.

43:26.480 --> 43:27.630
My goodness.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.876
Oh. Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill you.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.716
You are still far too useful
to us for that.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.197
But this is going to be...

43:43.920 --> 43:47.072
...so painful for you.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.595
Now, where's the phone?

44:00.560 --> 44:03.314
I want you to understand,
I mean you no ill will.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.278
My instructions were
to find your brother.

44:05.360 --> 44:08.398
Well, in that case, my phone's not gonna
do you any good. I just wiped it.

44:20.480 --> 44:21.516
Huh.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.856
Shouldn't we be talking
about what just happened?

44:26.880 --> 44:30.590
We got the access we needed to transfer
the money from the bank's side.

44:31.240 --> 44:34.517
Once we hack all of the members' phones
tonight at their meeting,

44:34.840 --> 44:37.230
- we can rob them blind...
- That's not what I meant.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.759
What you meant
doesn't matter.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.957
- Krista?
<i>- Elliot, I need to see you.</i>

44:50.400 --> 44:52.835
I'm actually kind of busy.
Can I call you tomorrow?

44:52.960 --> 44:55.998
<i>I was kidnapped by someone
you know. Fernando Vera.</i>

44:57.440 --> 45:00.080
<i>He wanted to know everything
about you, everything I knew.</i>

45:00.160 --> 45:01.560
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't know
what to do.</i>

45:01.600 --> 45:03.114
<i>I didn't have a choice.
He had a gun.</i>

45:03.200 --> 45:04.656
<i>Once he got what he wanted,
he let me go.</i>

45:04.680 --> 45:08.151
<i>I went to the police, but now I'm
too afraid to go back home. I'm scared.</i>

45:08.240 --> 45:10.357
Slow down.
Where are you right now?

45:10.440 --> 45:12.238
<i>I'm... I don't know.
Downtown, I think.</i>

45:12.320 --> 45:15.392
I can meet you at Washington Square Park.
Can you get there?

45:15.720 --> 45:16.756
<i>I think so.</i>

45:17.080 --> 45:18.799
- I'll see you soon.
<i>- Okay.</i>

45:22.320 --> 45:24.400
There's no way
he's just gonna let her go.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.670
I know.

45:34.280 --> 45:36.670
<i>Here we go again,
off to play the hero.</i>

45:36.760 --> 45:38.672
<i>But is that even
who we are anymore?</i>

45:39.360 --> 45:40.953
<i>You saw what
we did back there.</i>

45:41.040 --> 45:43.191
<i>We just watched him
destroy someone's life.</i>

45:44.240 --> 45:45.993
<i>And none of us
did a thing about it.</i>

45:48.840 --> 45:50.433
<i>Rules, morals, parameters,</i>

45:51.640 --> 45:53.711
<i>they only break if you're broken
to begin with.</i>

45:53.960 --> 45:55.474
<i>Did we change
under pressure,</i>

45:55.560 --> 45:57.916
<i>or did this only reveal
who we really are?</i>

45:58.120 --> 45:59.395
<i>I don't know anymore.</i>

45:59.480 --> 46:00.914
<i>The one thing I do know is...</i>

46:01.000 --> 46:02.195
Hey... Hey!

46:03.680 --> 46:05.080
Get... Get off of me!

46:05.160 --> 46:07.470
Wait. Wait! Wait!

46:08.160 --> 46:09.310
Help!

46:09.480 --> 46:11.119
Hey! Help!

46:11.800 --> 46:14.031
Help! Help!

46:15.600 --> 46:16.750
Help!
