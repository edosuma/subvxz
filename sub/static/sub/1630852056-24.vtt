00:00.467 --> 00:01.967
I noticed the dog
started running

00:02.033 --> 00:05.400
and then he charged at me,
my dog, and my cousins.

00:05.467 --> 00:07.300
I'm yelling and screaming
for help.

00:07.367 --> 00:08.934
No, no.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.900
-Two of you have parents?
-Yep.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.200
Do you think
they watch me?

00:12.266 --> 00:14.467
Yeah, they watch you. [laughs]

00:14.533 --> 00:17.367
So, you don't want to
embarrass yourself, right?

00:17.433 --> 00:19.600
Let's be real careful here.

00:56.834 --> 00:57.834
Thank you.

00:59.033 --> 01:00.500
Thank you.

01:00.567 --> 01:03.900
Miss Alston, you were not
a witness to this event.

01:03.967 --> 01:05.367
-Is that correct?
-[Kayla] Correct.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.533
It was your daughter
who was walking your dog?

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
Yes.

01:08.667 --> 01:09.667
Your daughter here,
I assume.

01:09.734 --> 01:10.767
[Kayla] Yes.

01:10.834 --> 01:11.900
-[Judy] Is that you?
-Yes.

01:11.967 --> 01:13.000
[Judy] Step up, please.

01:16.133 --> 01:18.934
And your first name--

01:19.000 --> 01:20.667
-Kayla Alston.
-[Judy] Kayla.

01:20.734 --> 01:24.266
Kayla, do you remember
walking your dog?

01:24.333 --> 01:26.867
You have a Miniature Pinscher,
your mom does.

01:26.934 --> 01:27.967
It belongs to your mom?

01:28.033 --> 01:29.533
-Yes.
-[Judy] It doesn't give me

01:29.600 --> 01:31.934
a date in either
the complaint or the answer.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.834
On what date in October
did this incident take place?

01:35.900 --> 01:37.800
-It was October 1st.
-[Judy] Time of day?

01:37.867 --> 01:40.700
It was around one or two p.m.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.934
And you were taking
your dog, your mom's dog,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.834
Miniature Pinscher,
out for a walk.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.367
Were you with a boyfriend?

01:46.433 --> 01:49.300
No, I was with my two cousins,
um, eight and five.

01:49.367 --> 01:52.000
Were you taking the dog
out for a regular dog walk,

01:52.066 --> 01:53.767
or were you going someplace?

01:53.834 --> 01:55.400
No, I was taking him
on a regular--

01:55.467 --> 01:56.934
on a regular walk
around the neighborhood.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.066
Dog on leash?

01:58.133 --> 02:01.400
-Yes.
-How far away from your house

02:01.467 --> 02:02.600
is the defendant's house?

02:02.667 --> 02:05.533
Like a minute.
It's right around the street.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.767
How long have you
been living there?

02:06.834 --> 02:07.867
About a year.

02:07.934 --> 02:09.300
Have you ever seen
the defendant before?

02:09.367 --> 02:10.500
No.

02:10.567 --> 02:11.834
Had you ever seen
his dog before?

02:11.900 --> 02:12.934
No.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.300
Has the dog ever been
out in the yard that you heard?

02:15.367 --> 02:16.400
-Yes.
-[Judy] I assume

02:16.467 --> 02:17.500
you walk your dog regularly?

02:17.567 --> 02:19.633
Yes. Um, I have heard him
barking a few times,

02:19.700 --> 02:21.266
but he never did anything.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.834
We just did a regular walk,
and that was it.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.533
Did you see the dog
when you heard the dog bark?

02:26.600 --> 02:29.133
I saw him run
across the fence, um,

02:29.200 --> 02:30.266
but that was about it.

02:30.333 --> 02:31.333
-[Judy] But inside?
-[Kayla] Yeah.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.533
-[Judy] Not outside the fence?
-[Kayla] Yeah.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.000
Your Pinscher,
how large is that dog?

02:35.066 --> 02:37.500
He's about 14 pounds.

02:37.567 --> 02:39.533
And what kind of dog
does the defendant have?

02:39.600 --> 02:41.567
-Um, a pit bull.
-How old is your pit bull?

02:41.633 --> 02:43.867
Callie is roughly five years old.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.266
Have you had the dog
since a puppy?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.934
No, I adopted her
when she was a year and a half.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.500
-[Judy] From where?
-Uh, the Humane Society

02:50.567 --> 02:51.700
in Alpharetta, Georgia.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.000
And about how much
does she weigh?

02:53.066 --> 02:55.200
Callie weighs about 65...

02:55.266 --> 02:56.333
65 pounds.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.867
Is she your only dog?

02:57.934 --> 02:59.033
No, I have two dogs.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.433
And what kind of dog
is the other one?

03:00.500 --> 03:01.633
It's a mutt--

03:01.700 --> 03:04.233
It's a pit bull mix
with a collie.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.567
That's an odd combo.

03:05.633 --> 03:06.834
Yeah. [laughs]

03:06.900 --> 03:07.900
And how old is that dog?

03:07.967 --> 03:10.233
About two years old,
going on two.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.700
Were you home
when this incident occurred?

03:12.767 --> 03:14.000
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] And now, tell me first,

03:14.066 --> 03:15.600
did you witness the incident?

03:15.667 --> 03:17.300
-No, Your Honor.
-Who is this person?

03:17.367 --> 03:19.500
-That is my brother.
-Does he live with you?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.600
At the time he did.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.033
How long had he been
living with you?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.233
A year at the time.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.867
And he was home
at one or two in the afternoon?

03:25.934 --> 03:27.734
Yes, he was actually
outside the house,

03:27.800 --> 03:28.834
right outside the house.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.834
Just tell me--
about what time that day

03:31.900 --> 03:34.166
did you let Callie out
into the backyard?

03:34.233 --> 03:35.700
Callie, that's her main domain

03:35.767 --> 03:38.033
-is the backyard, right--
-So, she's an outside dog?

03:38.100 --> 03:39.934
Does she sleep
inside the house or out?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.133
-Outside.
-[Judy] Where do you live?

03:41.200 --> 03:42.266
Union City, Georgia.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.367
Does Callie
ever come into the house?

03:44.433 --> 03:46.100
Uh, occasionally,
here and there.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.367
What I'm saying, daily,

03:47.433 --> 03:48.734
does the dog
come into the house?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.667
No, it's a, daily,
it's an outside dog.

03:50.734 --> 03:52.333
If it's daily,
it's an outside dog,

03:52.400 --> 03:54.133
-then it's a guard dog.
-Uh, you could say

03:54.200 --> 03:56.200
-it is a guard dog.
-Well, it's a guard dog unless,

03:56.266 --> 03:59.033
because the only contact
that it has with people

03:59.100 --> 04:01.433
is if somebody goes
outside the house

04:01.500 --> 04:03.133
to play with the dog,
to be with the dog,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.133
to socialize with the dog,
to interact with the dog.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.500
Otherwise, the dog
is outside by itself,

04:08.567 --> 04:09.734
guarding the house.

04:09.800 --> 04:10.800
-Or--
-[Judy] Sleeps outside,

04:10.867 --> 04:12.000
eats outside,

04:12.066 --> 04:14.934
does its business outside.
So far, okay.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.867
It's just a dog outside. Yeah.

04:16.934 --> 04:18.266
How large a property
do you have?

04:18.333 --> 04:19.433
A acre and a half.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.166
And how much of it is fenced?

04:21.233 --> 04:22.533
Uh, more than half.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.467
Besides the house,
everything's fenced.

04:24.533 --> 04:26.834
The front yard is not,
but the whole backyard,

04:26.900 --> 04:28.834
which is about a half an acre, is fenced.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.333
Do you have a photograph
of your house?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.734
-[Christopher] Yes.
-I'd like to take a look at it.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.400
Would you like the front or--

04:34.467 --> 04:35.633
-I'd like--
-[Christopher] --the backyard?

04:35.700 --> 04:37.300
Well, I'd like to see
where the fence is.

04:37.367 --> 04:38.433
Okay.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
I'll take a look
at all your pictures,

04:39.567 --> 04:41.567
and then I'm going to get back
to the plaintiff.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.000
These are all of the houses.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.133
[Kevin] Here, Judge.

04:50.633 --> 04:53.133
And that fence is about
seven feet tall, Your Honor.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.433
[Judy] Hm-mm.

04:56.834 --> 04:59.633
Okay, Kayla,
let's have the story.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.734
One or two to the afternoon,
first of October--

05:02.800 --> 05:04.433
[Kayla] Yes, my cousins
and I were walking,

05:04.500 --> 05:07.800
and we went down
to turn to his street.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.000
And as we kept on walking,

05:09.066 --> 05:10.567
I noticed the dog
started to bark.

05:10.633 --> 05:13.000
I think he heard
the chains on my dog.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.233
[Judy] Don't tell me
what you think.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.333
Okay. And he,
I heard him barking.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.633
And as we kept walking closer,

05:19.700 --> 05:22.000
I noticed the dog
started running across.

05:22.066 --> 05:24.066
-And then I--
-[Judy] How could you see that?

05:24.133 --> 05:25.233
There's a big fence.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.367
But the fence has... um...

05:27.433 --> 05:28.500
-Slats in it?
-[Kayla] Yes.

05:28.567 --> 05:29.967
And you could see
through the slats?

05:30.033 --> 05:31.333
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.433
And then, I noticed that
he started jumping up and down,

05:33.500 --> 05:36.000
and I saw his head
over the fence

05:36.066 --> 05:37.400
as he kept jumping
up and down.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.166
And then I noticed that he was
holding on to the fence,

05:40.233 --> 05:41.467
um, with his face above it.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.867
And then he flew over the fence

05:43.934 --> 05:46.467
and charged at me,
my dog, and my cousins.

05:46.533 --> 05:48.800
So, he charged to my dog,
but I didn't know if

05:48.867 --> 05:52.066
he was going to charge at me
my cousins, or my dog.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.266
So, I told my cousins

05:53.333 --> 05:54.900
to go stand on the side
of the street.

05:54.967 --> 05:56.233
And then, um, he ended up--

05:56.300 --> 05:58.900
-[Kayla] --charging at my dog.
-Where-where exactly were you?

05:58.967 --> 06:01.734
Um, so his house
is at the corner.

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
And then there's the street

06:02.867 --> 06:04.834
and then the other house
is on the side.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.166
Well, but I'm looking
at his house,

06:06.233 --> 06:09.800
there's a lot of green,
there's a lot of lawn

06:09.867 --> 06:13.233
that belongs to the defendant,
before you get to the fence.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.433
Right.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.700
Was, what's your dog's name?

06:15.767 --> 06:17.233
-Chico.
-[Judy] Chico.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.367
Was Chico on the grass?

06:19.433 --> 06:20.567
No, we were still in, um,

06:20.633 --> 06:22.133
about in the middle
of the street.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.200
[Judy] You mean,
on the sidewalk.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.400
No, um,
he doesn't have a sidewalk.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.367
It's just his grass,
and then the street.

06:27.433 --> 06:28.567
-[Judy] Okay.
-So, he was right

06:28.633 --> 06:30.000
-in the middle of the street.
-Okay.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.667
And then, um, so his dog
charged at my dog,

06:32.734 --> 06:35.834
and then, um, I'm yelling
and screaming for help.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.934
And I'm pulling
my dog's leash

06:38.000 --> 06:39.900
because I didn't know,
I didn't want to pick up my dog

06:39.967 --> 06:42.066
and I didn't want
the pit bull to bite me

06:42.133 --> 06:43.133
if I did pick up my dog.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.834
So, I was pulling the leash
and screaming out for help.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.066
And then, at that point,

06:48.133 --> 06:50.567
the neighbor from
across the street

06:50.633 --> 06:52.700
heard me yelling, and then
he came all the way over.

06:52.767 --> 06:55.266
And that person
was able to separate the dogs?

06:55.333 --> 06:57.433
-Yes, it's--
-[Judy] How did he do that?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.133
-You saw him do that?
-[Kayla] Yes.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.033
Um, he stood in front of
the dog and my dog,

07:02.100 --> 07:04.333
and tried to, um, block them.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.100
Was your dog attacked yet?

07:06.166 --> 07:08.433
Yes, that's when,
um, he had already bit him.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.633
-Okay.
-[Kayla] And then I'm still

07:09.700 --> 07:12.600
trying to pull the leash
and separate them.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.767
Well, now he's separated

07:13.834 --> 07:16.467
because of the neighbor
stood in between them.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.200
Right, but he,
the pit bull,

07:18.266 --> 07:19.400
went between his legs

07:19.467 --> 07:21.734
because he didn't want
to touch the pit bull either,

07:21.800 --> 07:22.867
because he didn't want him
to bite him.

07:22.934 --> 07:24.066
[Christopher laughs]

07:24.133 --> 07:25.467
So, the pit bull
kept running around his legs,

07:25.533 --> 07:27.834
and then he finally got a grip
around his neck.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.133
And then he told me
to take my dog and myself

07:31.200 --> 07:32.533
and go back home
and take him home.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.967
Was there ever a time
when you dropped the leash?

07:37.033 --> 07:38.934
-No.
-Before the attack?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.266
-No.
-Did you see, at any time,

07:42.333 --> 07:45.834
your dog burrowing
under the fence,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.467
and then burrowing back?

07:47.533 --> 07:48.667
No, ma'am.

07:48.734 --> 07:53.533
At any time, did you go
on the defendant's property

07:53.600 --> 07:55.033
to retrieve your dog?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.400
-No, ma'am.
-Okay, you're up.

07:57.467 --> 07:59.300
[dramatic music]

07:59.367 --> 08:01.100
Two of you have parents?

08:01.166 --> 08:02.767
-Yeah.
-Do you think they watch me?

08:02.834 --> 08:04.400
No, they don't like you.

08:04.467 --> 08:05.600
[Christopher]
No, they watch. [laughs]

08:05.667 --> 08:07.266
[laughs]

08:07.333 --> 08:09.033
So, you don't want to
embarrass yourself, right?

08:13.967 --> 08:16.900
[dramatic music]

Tell me your last name.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.400
Marks. M-A-R-K-S.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.700
Mr. Marks, your brother
says that you were outside,

08:32.767 --> 08:34.667
and you witnessed this event?

08:34.734 --> 08:36.000
Where were you?

08:36.066 --> 08:38.567
I was in my car
in a phone interview.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.633
In your car.
Where was your car?

08:40.700 --> 08:44.934
It's like parked,
like, right by the fence,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.333
but it's facing
a different direction.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.533
So, you're looking
away from the fence.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.467
I'm looking--
the fence--

08:51.533 --> 08:55.100
the fence line is like
right beside where my car is.

08:55.166 --> 08:59.533
And then the front of the fence
is on the, facing the other street.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.734
Would you give Mr. Marks a pen,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.633
tell him to look
through those pictures

09:04.700 --> 09:06.400
that his brother just gave me.

09:06.467 --> 09:09.600
And I want you to mark
on those pictures

09:09.667 --> 09:13.133
where exactly your car was.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.967
And you're in the car,
talking on the phone.

09:17.033 --> 09:18.500
-[Jeremy] Yep.
-[Judy] Okay, now, Kevin,

09:18.567 --> 09:19.700
I'd like you to give

09:19.767 --> 09:22.834
that picture and the pen
to Kayla.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.734
And I want you to see, Kayla,

09:24.800 --> 09:29.367
if you can see exactly
where you were with the dog.

09:30.867 --> 09:31.900
It was on--

09:33.166 --> 09:35.500
[Judy] And if it's not there,
he has other pictures.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.467
Yes.
Can I see another picture?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.400
Now, Kevin,
I'd like to see both.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.266
Okay. Go ahead.
You were on the phone--?

09:59.333 --> 10:00.667
Yes, I was
on the phone--

10:00.734 --> 10:02.700
[Judy] Did you hear the dog,

10:02.767 --> 10:04.667
-your brother's dog, bark?
-[Jeremy] I-I heard--

10:04.734 --> 10:08.667
First, I was in my car
on the phone,

10:08.734 --> 10:12.100
and I can see a girl
walking down the street

10:12.166 --> 10:13.233
and two little boys.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.834
So, you know, I'm-I'm not
thinking nothin' of it.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.300
I'm just still doing

10:17.367 --> 10:18.600
-my phone interview.
-[Judy] Okay.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.233
Were they coming towards you?

10:20.300 --> 10:21.567
Yeah, they was
coming towards me.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.967
They were coming towards you.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.800
Exercise day.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.500
I want you to have him put down

10:30.567 --> 10:33.834
where you saw them
for the first time.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.600
So, they was back here.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.300
[Judy] Great.
Thank you very much.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.467
Thanks, Kevin.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.300
Okay, so they were,
as she says,

10:44.367 --> 10:46.133
walking in the middle
of the street.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.266
Walking in the middle.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.400
[Judy] Go ahead.

10:48.467 --> 10:50.100
Okay, as they was
walking in the middle--

10:50.166 --> 10:51.600
Care-- let's be careful here.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.800
Jeremy, let's be
real careful here.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.467
So, the first time
you saw Kayla,

10:57.533 --> 10:59.400
she was walking
with the two boys,

10:59.467 --> 11:01.900
as she said, in the middle
of the street.

11:01.967 --> 11:02.967
Yes.

11:03.033 --> 11:06.333
[Judy] Then I don't care what
you wrote here in the answer.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.300
I want you to tell me
what happened.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.533
Okay, as I'm seeing them--

11:10.600 --> 11:12.800
Just a second.
Two of you have parents?

11:12.867 --> 11:14.533
-Yep.
-Do you think they watch me?

11:14.600 --> 11:16.066
No, they don't like you.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.433
[Christopher]
No. They watch. [laughs]

11:17.500 --> 11:19.567
[laugh]

11:20.066 --> 11:21.233
Of course they do.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.467
So, you don't want to
embarrass yourself, right?

11:23.533 --> 11:24.767
No. [laughs]

11:24.834 --> 11:27.967
So, you're gonna
tell me exactly what it is

11:28.033 --> 11:30.600
-that happened on that day.
-Your Honor.

11:30.667 --> 11:34.200
And understanding
that we're not talking about

11:34.266 --> 11:37.433
anybody doing anything
purposefully, right.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.266
You and your brother seem
like two nice young men.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.033
-[Judy] Let's have it.
-[Jeremy] All right.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.033
As I'm in my car
and I'm in a phone interview,

11:45.100 --> 11:47.734
I can see, I'm looking
in my rearview mirror,

11:47.800 --> 11:52.233
you know, I can see that
the girl and her two cousins

11:52.300 --> 11:53.900
are, you know,
like she was saying,

11:53.967 --> 11:55.367
walking down the street.

11:55.433 --> 11:56.834
Okay, so they were
coming towards you,

11:56.900 --> 11:58.700
but you-you were looking
in the rearview mirror?

11:58.767 --> 11:59.900
[Jeremy] Yes.

11:59.967 --> 12:02.734
I assume that you were
looking in the rearview mirror

12:02.800 --> 12:04.533
because if you're
on an interview,

12:04.600 --> 12:05.900
you would be concentrating--

12:05.967 --> 12:06.967
-[Judy] --on the phone.
-Concentrating.

12:07.033 --> 12:10.066
Right. So, I assume that something
caught your attention.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.834
So, you must have heard
the dog barking, your dog?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.166
Yes, I can--
I can see the dog walking.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.367
Back and forth.

12:16.433 --> 12:17.800
-[Jeremy] Yes.
-And barking?

12:17.867 --> 12:19.000
[Jeremy] Barking.

12:19.066 --> 12:22.133
But I can see them as I'm
looking at them from a distance,

12:22.200 --> 12:25.700
they didn't, they had a leash,
but they were just lettin'

12:25.767 --> 12:27.567
the dog walk itself,
basically. So--

12:27.633 --> 12:28.633
[Judy] In the middle
of the street?

12:28.700 --> 12:29.700
In the middle of the street.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.667
Okay. And you saw all that
while you're, you know,

12:32.734 --> 12:35.233
looking backwards towards them
while on an interview.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.133
-[Jeremy] Yeah.
-So, the dog was on a leash,

12:37.200 --> 12:38.300
but they were letting

12:38.367 --> 12:41.567
-the leash drag on the filthy--
-By itself.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.266
Okay, go ahead.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.433
[Jeremy]
And as the dog, he can--

12:45.500 --> 12:48.233
he can hear other dogs
up in the backyard,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.100
-near the fence. It dashed--
-[Judy] What other--?

12:50.166 --> 12:52.934
-[Jeremy] Over to the fence.
-What other dogs?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
My brother's dogs.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.600
So, both of them
were in the back?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.033
Yes, both of them
is in the back.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.667
Is the Collie mix puppy
kept outside as well?

13:00.734 --> 13:01.734
Yes.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.867
[Judy] All the time?

13:02.934 --> 13:04.300
-Yes.
-Never comes inside?

13:04.367 --> 13:05.467
Never.

13:05.533 --> 13:07.433
Did they have
a-a dog house outside?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.734
-Yes.
-So, you saw both dogs?

13:09.800 --> 13:11.133
Well, you heard both dogs.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.567
-[Jeremy] I heard both.
-And you could see them.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.567
I can see them because
I'm near the fence line,

13:14.633 --> 13:20.800
so I can see-- it's like holes
in-in between it, so I can see--

13:20.867 --> 13:21.867
-[Judy] Right.
-[Jeremy]--in back there.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.400
That's what Kayla said.
And then what did you see?

13:24.467 --> 13:27.400
As the dog
was dashing towards the fence,

13:27.467 --> 13:29.266
it was basically aggressive.

13:29.333 --> 13:33.700
The dogs, you know, they just started
just going back and forth,

13:33.767 --> 13:34.900
back and forth.

13:34.967 --> 13:37.500
The dog was using the bathroom
on the-- on the grass.

13:37.567 --> 13:41.533
As the dog ran back to the front
of the fence, I, uh,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.333
I don't know, it just happened
to get under the fence.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.767
I don't know how it did it.

13:46.834 --> 13:50.000
You can see nothin'
but the dog just scuffling.

13:50.066 --> 13:53.300
I can hear him, but you're not
gonna see just through there.

13:53.367 --> 13:56.100
Next thing, you know,
the dog is from under the fence,

13:56.166 --> 13:57.166
and they take off running,

13:57.233 --> 13:59.734
the girl and the boys
take off running.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.900
Running in what direction?

14:00.967 --> 14:02.800
Back towards
the other side of the street.

14:02.867 --> 14:03.900
-You mean, away from the dog?
-[Jeremy] From where the front

14:03.967 --> 14:06.900
of the fence is, back towards
their way they came from.

14:06.967 --> 14:10.700
So, they, in effect,
left the dog in your back--

14:10.767 --> 14:11.900
No, they picked the dog up,

14:11.967 --> 14:13.600
-and took off--
-[Judy] Well, how did they--

14:13.667 --> 14:15.967
how did they get the dog
back up?

14:16.033 --> 14:18.467
The dog just ran back up
under the fence,

14:18.533 --> 14:20.567
and they was coming
onto the grass.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.500
[Judy] Well, coming
onto the grass.

14:22.567 --> 14:23.834
How did the dog--?

14:23.900 --> 14:26.533
First you told me that the dog
was running back and forth.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.734
Then it got under the fence.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.900
Yes.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.333
And you said
they went running away

14:31.400 --> 14:34.667
in the opposite direction.
Don't-- don't help him.

14:34.734 --> 14:36.367
Well, were they running
towards the dog,

14:36.433 --> 14:37.433
-or away from him?
-[Jeremy] Well, no--

14:37.500 --> 14:40.033
they was running towards the dog
first to get their dog.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.734
Then they started running
the, uh, uh--

14:41.800 --> 14:43.233
Oh, well,
you left that part out.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.900
You said,
soon as it went under,

14:44.967 --> 14:48.033
they ran back in the direction
that they came from,

14:48.100 --> 14:49.400
leaving the--
that's why I said,

14:49.467 --> 14:50.967
leaving their dog
behind the fence?

14:51.033 --> 14:52.200
No, no.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.533
So, they went onto the grass.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.700
Onto the grass.

14:56.767 --> 15:00.367
And by that time,
what you're telling me is

15:00.433 --> 15:04.633
their dog injured because
the dog was injured, right?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.133
Did you get out of your car?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.200
No, I was still--

15:07.266 --> 15:08.333
[Judy] No, no, no.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.233
When you've heard
all this commotion

15:10.300 --> 15:12.767
and what you said you saw was,

15:12.834 --> 15:15.800
their dog running up,
getting under the fence.

15:15.867 --> 15:19.166
You know that your brother
has two large dogs,

15:19.233 --> 15:22.700
you know this is a smaller dog.
And you heard scuffle.

15:22.767 --> 15:24.734
At what point did you get
out of the car?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.967
I never got out the car.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.967
-I was in the--
-[Judy laughs loudly]

15:28.033 --> 15:30.033
[Jeremy laughs]
I was in the interview.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.000
So, you know, I can't just
leave my phone interview

15:33.066 --> 15:34.700
just to go to a dog fight.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.800
[chuckles]

15:35.867 --> 15:37.767
Really? Your mother's
gonna be thrilled with you.

15:37.834 --> 15:38.900
[Jeremy laughs]

15:38.967 --> 15:40.567
-[Christopher] Good job.
-For a lot of reasons.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.633
-[Jeremy nervous laugh]
-For a lot of reasons.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.066
Give me the reason
that you're in your car?

15:46.133 --> 15:47.400
It was a job interview

15:47.467 --> 15:49.500
that I was trying to get,
you know.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.100
No, no, no, I don't know.

15:51.166 --> 15:54.100
This is not going to get easier.
It's going to get harder.

15:58.767 --> 16:01.800
[dramatic music]

16:04.734 --> 16:06.533
[narrator] <i>Sharon Alston</i>
<i>says her neighbor</i>

16:06.600 --> 16:07.633
<i>Christopher Marks</i>

16:07.700 --> 16:10.333
<i>is responsible</i>
<i>for injuries her dog received</i>

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
<i>from Christopher's pit bull.</i>

16:12.066 --> 16:13.367
You want to
tell me a reason

16:13.433 --> 16:14.533
that I'm going to believe

16:14.600 --> 16:16.934
that you're sitting
in a job interview,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.533
something that you clearly want,

16:18.600 --> 16:22.600
outside in your car
rather than inside

16:22.667 --> 16:25.934
where there are no dogs,
because your dogs are outside.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.767
Give me the reason
that you're in your car.

16:27.834 --> 16:31.333
I had just made it home
from going to the store.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.800
And I had a phone interview.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.500
They was just calling me
as I'm pulling up.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.266
And then, that's why
I was basically in my car.

16:38.333 --> 16:42.367
[laughs] Was this a preset
job interview, and with whom?

16:42.433 --> 16:43.667
It was a job interview

16:43.734 --> 16:45.800
that I was trying to get,
you know.

16:45.867 --> 16:47.367
No, no, no,
I don't know.

16:47.433 --> 16:50.233
This is not going to get easier.
It's going to get harder.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.200
With whom was the job interview,

16:52.266 --> 16:54.667
because your brother says
he got the job?

16:54.734 --> 16:56.700
It's basically PetSmart.
So, it's like--

16:56.767 --> 17:00.200
No, no, no. It's basically,
it can't be basically PetSmart.

17:00.266 --> 17:01.400
[Jeremy] It is, it is.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.100
-It is a temp agency--
-[Judy] Shhh.

17:05.433 --> 17:07.533
Now, had you
applied for the job?

17:07.600 --> 17:08.600
[Jeremy] I had.

17:08.667 --> 17:11.734
They said they was gonna call me
within a certain timeframe.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.066
And that's when
they mentioned to call me.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.667
So, you had no specific
time for the interview?

17:17.734 --> 17:19.500
-No.
-[Judy] So, as you were

17:19.567 --> 17:21.900
pulling up,
you were on the phone

17:21.967 --> 17:24.900
with PetSmart,
people who love animals.

17:24.967 --> 17:26.467
It was the temp agency

17:26.533 --> 17:27.567
-with PetSmart.
-[Judy] Just a--

17:27.633 --> 17:30.800
just a second.
So, it wasn't PetSmart.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.433
It was for an agency,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.133
you would apply to
an employment agency

17:36.200 --> 17:38.000
that works for
a lot of people, right?

17:38.066 --> 17:39.200
Yes.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.567
And that phone call
could have been taken

17:41.633 --> 17:44.266
in five minutes, in ten minutes,
that doesn't matter.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.433
It's a temp agency.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.033
You didn't have an appointment
with somebody at an interview.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.900
I'm just trying to figure out

17:49.967 --> 17:53.700
why somebody who hears
a major kerfuffle outside

17:53.767 --> 17:57.934
with a pit bull,
a pit bull mix and a small dog,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.433
doesn't get out of his car

17:59.500 --> 18:03.700
when he sees the small dog
burrowing under a fence.

18:03.767 --> 18:07.333
I don't understand
a person like that, actually,

18:07.400 --> 18:11.100
who doesn't get out of their car
and see if they can help.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.867
You see a girl
and two little boys,

18:13.934 --> 18:15.300
and you just stayed in the car?

18:15.367 --> 18:17.834
Well, I seen the dog under.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.900
I never seen my-my
brother's dog get out.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.233
But you told me
you heard and saw

18:23.300 --> 18:25.100
the dogs going back and forth

18:25.166 --> 18:26.233
-when--
-[Jeremy] Yes.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.700
[Judy] --her dog
was relieving itself--

18:27.767 --> 18:30.433
when her dog was relieving
itself on the grass.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.100
So, you knew
that there was trouble,

18:33.166 --> 18:36.533
that the dogs were agitated,
because you just told me

18:36.600 --> 18:38.066
you saw them
running back and forth.

18:38.133 --> 18:39.266
-Yes.
-[Judy] And barking.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.700
But they was
in the backyard.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.600
But then you just told me you saw,

18:43.667 --> 18:48.300
with your own eyes, her dog
burrowing under the fence.

18:48.367 --> 18:51.066
No, I didn't say
burrowed under the fence.

18:51.133 --> 18:53.800
I said I don't know how the dog
got under the fence.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.000
Well, then you didn't see.

18:55.066 --> 18:56.066
[Jeremy] From the side of fence,

18:56.133 --> 18:58.400
I can see the dog
inside the fence.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.734
You can't see the dog
inside the fence, sir,

19:00.800 --> 19:02.700
unless you saw the dog
get inside the fence.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.934
My eyes wouldn't-- would be
riveted if I saw that.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.700
Sit down.
Your mother's embarrassed.

19:07.767 --> 19:08.834
Sit down.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.834
[laughs] Okay.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.700
Can I see
the vet bills, please?

19:14.767 --> 19:16.233
And pictures of the dog.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.300
You're the older brother?

19:19.367 --> 19:20.867
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Yeah.

19:20.934 --> 19:23.266
Your Honor,
my fence is seven feet tall.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.333
[Judy] Mm-mm.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.633
Your brother's a fibber.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.734
I guess my dog is Air Bud.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.100
Your brother's a fibber.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.066
No.

19:33.133 --> 19:34.767
He didn't see
what he says he saw.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.000
Kayla, when you went
and retrieved the dog,

19:39.066 --> 19:41.233
did you carry the dog home,
or did it walk home?

19:41.300 --> 19:42.433
[Kayla] I carried him.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.133
Did you ever see
the injury to the dog, sir?

19:45.200 --> 19:46.900
Uh, yes,
when she sent the picture.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.734
I don't know how that injury
came about though,

19:48.800 --> 19:49.834
-I mean--
-[Judy] Just a second.

19:49.900 --> 19:50.900
[Christopher] He
scurried under the fence,

19:50.967 --> 19:52.000
so it could have been hidden--

19:52.066 --> 19:53.066
I don't believe that.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.233
I don't believe that
that's true.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.700
-And my dog got a bit on its ear.
-[Judy] Shh, shh, just a second.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.834
You say this is off from
what your brother tells you.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.834
"At first the fence was
able to keep their dog away,

20:02.900 --> 20:06.100
but their dog breached the fence
by skirting underneath."

20:06.166 --> 20:07.934
-[Christopher] Mm-mm.
-Something he didn't see,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.367
because he says he didn't see.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.400
He doesn't know how
this 14-pound dog

20:11.467 --> 20:13.200
breached the seven-foot fence.

20:13.266 --> 20:16.600
"Their dog nipped Callie
on the ear."

20:16.667 --> 20:17.734
That he certainly didn't see

20:17.800 --> 20:19.066
because he said
he didn't see anything

20:19.133 --> 20:21.934
that happened besides the fence,
"and caused the fight."

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Well, you don't know that
because you weren't there

20:24.066 --> 20:25.300
and he-- and he didn't see it.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.000
If it goes under the fence,
it caused the fight.

20:27.066 --> 20:28.700
-[Judy] No. No, no, no, sir.
-He's trespassing.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.400
[Judy] No, what
you're telling me,

20:30.467 --> 20:35.367
what you say here is, "Their dog
nipped Callie on the ear

20:35.433 --> 20:40.100
and caused the fight, but my dog
was not the aggressor."

20:40.166 --> 20:41.667
-Correct.
-[Judy] Well, I don't know that.

20:41.734 --> 20:43.900
And actually,
I don't believe him.

20:43.967 --> 20:46.600
So, I think that your dog
actually did breach the fence.

20:46.667 --> 20:47.667
And I think that her dog

20:47.734 --> 20:48.967
-[Judy] was probably on--
-[Christopher] How?

20:49.033 --> 20:50.500
I don't answer
your question, sir.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.667
I'm here to ask questions. That's my job.

20:52.734 --> 20:54.133
How, just as I don't know

20:54.200 --> 20:55.967
from the photographs
that you sent me

20:56.033 --> 20:57.100
how their dog
breached the fence,

20:57.166 --> 20:58.533
and you have no witness.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.467
And I don't think
he even saw what he saw,

21:00.533 --> 21:03.433
because if I were
on a job interview [laughs],

21:03.500 --> 21:05.567
a job interview
with a temp agency,

21:05.633 --> 21:07.800
I wouldn't be looking
in my rearview mirror.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.633
I would probably be
in the house.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.767
Let me take this call

21:10.834 --> 21:11.934
-in the house.
-I was working in the house.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.033
That's why. So I'm,
I have my phone calls going on

21:15.100 --> 21:17.100
and things of that nature
in the house.

21:17.166 --> 21:18.300
So, he was respecting me.

21:18.367 --> 21:19.700
I want to tell you
something.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.967
That is so ridiculous,
because that's not what he said.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.867
I want-- that's so ridiculous

21:23.934 --> 21:25.033
-[Judy] because that--
-[Christopher] But I'm telling

21:25.100 --> 21:26.533
-[Christopher] you, the nature--
-Listen, you have to listen.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.066
You have to listen
to what your brother said.

21:29.133 --> 21:32.667
Your brother didn't say he took
the call as a courtesy to you

21:32.734 --> 21:34.266
because you were talking
in the house.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.467
He said he took the call

21:36.533 --> 21:39.433
because he was just
driving up to the house

21:39.500 --> 21:41.567
from going to the store.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.266
And because the call came,

21:43.333 --> 21:44.934
and he had been waiting
for the call,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.800
he took the call in the car.

21:46.867 --> 21:49.133
He said nothing about,
it's quieter in the car

21:49.200 --> 21:50.333
than it is outside.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.967
Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Marks.
You also look foolish.

21:53.033 --> 21:54.333
-There's times where--
-[Judy] Okay.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.633
--he's coming
to the house on the phone

21:55.700 --> 21:57.800
and I'm not working,
and that's perfectly fine.

21:57.867 --> 21:58.900
He knew I was working.

21:58.967 --> 22:00.633
He would have came in the house
on the phone on his interview

22:00.700 --> 22:01.867
if that wasn't the case.

22:02.433 --> 22:03.667
You sound ridiculous.

22:03.734 --> 22:05.100
You're speculating.
This is our house,

22:05.166 --> 22:06.667
-so we know how it works.
-[Judy] Just a second.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.800
I don't deal
in speculation, sir.

22:08.867 --> 22:12.166
I deal in meat and potatoes.
This is the dog's injury.

22:12.233 --> 22:15.433
She says 'cause she was there,
and she saw it,

22:15.500 --> 22:17.633
that your dog jumped
and jumped and jumped,

22:17.700 --> 22:20.200
and finally got its paws
over the fence,

22:20.266 --> 22:25.100
its face over the fence,
and was over the fence.

22:25.166 --> 22:28.500
Her dog, I guarantee,
was on the grass,

22:28.567 --> 22:29.633
was on your grass.

22:29.700 --> 22:30.700
Trespassing.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.800
You had the fence there

22:32.867 --> 22:35.567
because you were trying
to contain your dog.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.934
That's the purpose.
Don't answer me.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.066
That's not a question.

22:39.133 --> 22:42.900
There's no question
that her dog agitated your dog

22:42.967 --> 22:45.433
by being on your grass.
There's no question there.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.367
There's also no question
that your dog

22:47.433 --> 22:49.467
was aggressive enough
to breach the fence,

22:49.533 --> 22:51.633
and strong enough
to breach the fence,

22:51.700 --> 22:53.400
and you owe her
for the vet bills.

22:53.467 --> 22:55.400
So, my dog jumped the fence--

22:55.467 --> 22:57.433
Oh, no, no,
I told you I don't.

22:57.500 --> 23:02.100
I told you I don't answer questions.
I told you. I told you.

23:02.166 --> 23:03.734
I don't answer questions.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.467
-I listen to what sounds--
-It's just logic. It's just logic.

23:05.533 --> 23:09.533
I listen to what,
I listen to what is before me,

23:09.600 --> 23:13.200
and what sounds common sense
because very often,

23:13.266 --> 23:14.734
you have to make
a determination.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.667
In this case, I have to
make a determination

23:16.734 --> 23:18.934
based upon who's telling the truth.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.133
That's it.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.333
Because I have two
different versions.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.567
One says your dog
was aggressive,

23:23.633 --> 23:25.967
breached the fence,
and injured her dog.

23:26.033 --> 23:28.100
Your brother says no,
that's not true,

23:28.166 --> 23:30.500
the dog somehow borrowed
under the fence

23:30.567 --> 23:32.633
which he didn't see.
That's what he said.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.734
He didn't see how the dog
got under the fence,

23:34.800 --> 23:38.166
but somehow got under the fence,
was attacked--

23:38.233 --> 23:39.367
Well, I have evidence

23:39.433 --> 23:40.633
to show how he got
under the fence.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.433
Just a second.
No, that's speculation, sir.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.700
So, we're both
speculating there. [laughs]

23:45.767 --> 23:47.367
No, my friend.

23:47.433 --> 23:50.567
As nice a smile as you have,
that's not speculation.

23:50.633 --> 23:53.133
This is truth telling.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.700
And I have to make a judgment,

23:54.767 --> 23:56.934
which of these two people
is telling the truth.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.867
And in this case,
since he didn't see

23:59.934 --> 24:02.867
what he says he saw
and his story to me--

24:02.934 --> 24:04.834
By the way,
did you ever see him

24:04.900 --> 24:06.600
that day on October 1st?

24:06.667 --> 24:07.800
No, not the whole day.

24:07.867 --> 24:10.433
Not the whole day, so,
and he never got out of his car.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.667
Okay. [sighs] Yeah.

24:12.734 --> 24:15.000
Judgment for the plaintiff
in the amount of 3,000 dollars.

24:15.066 --> 24:16.367
We're finished.
Thank you very much.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.667
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

24:17.734 --> 24:18.934
[dramatic music]

24:19.000 --> 24:20.867
I think she just
had a-a notion in her head

24:20.934 --> 24:22.033
that all pit bulls are bad.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.100
He jumped all the way
over that fence.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.567
My dog's an emotional support animal,

24:25.633 --> 24:27.967
and it never had any altercation
with any dog ever.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.133
If the neighbor
didn't come to help,

24:29.200 --> 24:30.867
my dog possibly
could have been killed.

24:30.934 --> 24:32.200
It came onto my property,

24:32.266 --> 24:34.000
trespassed, and scurried
under the fence.

24:34.066 --> 24:36.367
There's no way that
my dog could have even did that.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.233
Like I said, we were
in the middle of the street.

24:38.300 --> 24:41.333
If a dog go up under a fence,
it's gonna fight.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.767
He just needed to do
the right thing

24:43.834 --> 24:45.166
and pay the bill.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.400
[Sarah] You have two people

24:46.467 --> 24:47.500
that seem to be
equally credible.

24:47.567 --> 24:49.000
How do you make
that determination

24:49.066 --> 24:50.767
at the end of the day
of who to believe?

24:50.834 --> 24:53.133
In this case,
I really didn't believe the fact

24:53.200 --> 24:56.734
that the defendant's brother
was sitting in the car.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.667
It didn't make sense to me
that somebody who's a nice guy,

24:59.734 --> 25:00.934
and he seemed to be a nice guy,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.800
would hear
that kind of commotion

25:02.867 --> 25:04.767
and not get out of his car.

25:04.834 --> 25:07.400
His story didn't
make sense to me.

25:07.467 --> 25:08.900
And if something
doesn't make sense,

25:08.967 --> 25:10.400
it's usually not true.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.667
Could I be wrong?
Hmm, possibility.

25:12.734 --> 25:14.800
But that story just didn't
make sense to me.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.000
That's how.
