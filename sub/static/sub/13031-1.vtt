<font color="#FF0000">subtitle by Biax</font>

00:18.298 --> 00:22.997
[And we will wake
in the starlight]

00:24.604 --> 00:30.065
[Girl if you try to
Love him any harder oh]

00:30.143 --> 00:32.304
Nine million guys
in New York City,

00:32.378 --> 00:36.406
you'd think there'd
be one for me to date.
You'd be wrong.

00:38.085 --> 00:40.383
To start off, most
of the good ones
are taken.

00:43.023 --> 00:45.253
Then there's the
criminal contention.

00:45.325 --> 00:47.623
Let's go.

00:49.429 --> 00:53.422
The guys with the serious
psychological issues.

00:56.136 --> 00:57.626
The weirdos.

01:00.707 --> 01:02.004
Yeah.

01:03.677 --> 01:05.838
The bastards.

01:07.881 --> 01:11.282
And then the guys
in fashion, which
is my world.

01:11.351 --> 01:12.978
They do wonders
for my wardrobe,

01:13.053 --> 01:15.851
but they do nothing
to help me find
my magic man.

01:19.192 --> 01:21.160
Where is the one?

01:25.065 --> 01:26.623
Hey, Joanne.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.964
Lane. What's up?

01:29.035 --> 01:31.833
WeII, not
one guy today.

01:31.905 --> 01:35.341
Not one guy
that possesses one
quaIity on my checkIist.

01:35.409 --> 01:37.400
Oh, my God.
The checkIist again?

01:37.477 --> 01:41.811
I've toId you. You need
to use my checkIist.
It's way more fun.

01:41.882 --> 01:44.248
I know.
Can you remind me
what yours is again?

01:44.317 --> 01:48.947
With pIeasure.
Item one, breathing.
aIways important in a guy.

01:49.022 --> 01:52.651
And items two
through seven, cute.

01:52.726 --> 01:54.557
If onIy Iove was
that simpIe.

01:54.628 --> 01:56.095
Come, heIp me.

01:56.163 --> 01:58.131
Joanne is a
fashion photographer

01:58.198 --> 02:01.565
who thinks she's my big
sister. She tries to hook
me up with cute guys,

02:01.635 --> 02:04.502
but, more importantIy,
she hooked me up
with cheap rent.

02:04.571 --> 02:05.868
Ah

02:05.939 --> 02:07.304
Gotta love it.

02:07.374 --> 02:09.308
Oh, hey, I'm going
out tonight,

02:09.376 --> 02:12.743
and his roommate
is crazy cute.
You wanna join?

02:12.813 --> 02:15.611
Sh. Not in front
of the Cosmo.

02:19.085 --> 02:20.848
Hey!

02:24.157 --> 02:27.684
l'm a writer.
Oh, l love the
way that sounds.

02:27.761 --> 02:30.889
Oh, my God.
Actually, everyone loves
the way that sounds,

02:30.964 --> 02:33.023
and then they
ask me what l write.

02:33.099 --> 02:37.593
So far, it's been articles
for my college paper and
a few fashion blogs.

02:37.671 --> 02:41.573
But last month, l wrote a
freelance piece on shoes
for Her StyIe.

02:41.641 --> 02:44.769
l got published in
a national magazine.

02:46.780 --> 02:50.409
Okay, so it's barely
a national magazine,
but it's a stepping stone

02:50.484 --> 02:52.645
and they want
another story.

02:55.822 --> 02:58.484
Those are nice fIowers.
Your birthday?

02:58.558 --> 03:01.823
No. The doorman
sends them to me
every Monday

03:01.895 --> 03:06.855
for four years now.
Can you bIame him?

03:06.933 --> 03:09.163
She gets flowers
and l don't?

03:09.236 --> 03:13.764
So, you wiII be doing the
interview of AIicia McCuIIen,
the party pIanner.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.468
U h, cooI.
You know, I was
thinking after that

03:16.543 --> 03:19.512
that maybe I couId do
a story on statement
coats, because--

03:19.579 --> 03:22.571
J ust do the interview
of the party pIanner.

03:23.984 --> 03:26.043
Yeah. Sure.

03:26.119 --> 03:30.954
So, what is this for again?
ls it For Her magazine
or something?

03:31.024 --> 03:32.616
It's actuaIIy Her StyIe.

03:32.692 --> 03:34.387
Never heard of it.

03:34.461 --> 03:38.124
You wiII. After this
story, I'm sure we'II
doubIe in circuIation.

03:38.198 --> 03:40.063
FIattery wiII
get you everywhere.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.795
Thank you.

03:42.869 --> 03:45.235
So, um, the story
that l wanted to write

03:45.305 --> 03:47.739
is about fashion
trends for the eIite.

03:47.807 --> 03:49.274
Oh, weII.

03:49.342 --> 03:51.310
CompIiments
of the house.

03:51.378 --> 03:52.811
You never
forget, do you?

03:52.879 --> 03:54.471
No, ma'am.

03:54.548 --> 03:57.142
Do they just
bring you champagne
when you come here?

03:57.217 --> 03:59.412
My boyfriend
Rodrigo took me here
on our first date.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.078
He's friends
with the owner

04:01.154 --> 04:03.987
and he expIained
to him that he wanted
champagne sent to me

04:04.057 --> 04:06.617
every time I come here
so that I wouId aIways
think of him.

04:06.693 --> 04:09.321
That is so romantic.

04:09.396 --> 04:11.455
M m, I know.

04:11.531 --> 04:15.831
I've aIways dated
rich, hot guys,
but this one,

04:15.902 --> 04:17.802
he just Ieaves
me breathIess.

04:17.870 --> 04:20.601
I think the most
romantic thing he's
ever done is he, uh,

04:20.673 --> 04:23.802
mid-match at WimbIedon,
he bIew me a kiss.

04:23.877 --> 04:26.937
Are you speaking
of Rodrigo Navarro,

04:27.013 --> 04:29.675
Iike, the tennis champion?

04:29.749 --> 04:33.185
That's my
boyfriend. I know.

04:33.253 --> 04:35.187
l know l should
be happy for her.

04:35.255 --> 04:38.520
l mean, just because
l can't find my magic
man doesn't mean that--

04:43.997 --> 04:46.329
You have got to
be kidding me.

04:50.937 --> 04:52.928
My beautifuI
angel AIicia.

04:54.608 --> 04:56.166
l've been thinking
of you all day.

04:56.242 --> 04:59.143
How wouId you
Iike to head down
to St. Barts this weekend?

05:03.383 --> 05:05.510
I'd Iove to.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.852
Okay, can you stop
torturing me?

05:11.625 --> 05:14.685
Did I say that out
Ioud? I'm sorry.

05:21.401 --> 05:23.699
Okay, that's good.
All right, guys,
l want you

05:23.770 --> 05:26.898
to, Iike,
Iay back in a
warm embrace. Good.

05:26.973 --> 05:31.467
This shot, it needs
to be sexy but
not sexuaI.

05:31.544 --> 05:34.707
And it needs to say
'' I Iove you'' but not
'' I'm in Iove with you. ''

05:34.781 --> 05:38.581
And I want you
to be happy.
Not overjoyed.

05:38.652 --> 05:40.142
Okay.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.950
U m, wait. Okay,
take five, guys.

05:43.023 --> 05:46.720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You yeIIed at her in the
middIe of a restaurant?

05:46.793 --> 05:49.159
It was not the middIe
of the restaurant, okay?

05:49.229 --> 05:51.288
It was towards the back,
facing a window,

05:51.364 --> 05:53.298
and second of aII,
I didn't yeII at her.

05:53.366 --> 05:56.494
It was--
It was more
of a bIurt.

05:56.569 --> 05:58.662
I-I bIurted at her.

05:58.738 --> 06:01.707
I couIdn't heIp it.
She was being serenaded

06:01.775 --> 06:04.505
by her famous
tennis-star boyfr--

06:04.577 --> 06:06.943
Her gorgeous, famous,
tennis-star boyfriend

06:07.013 --> 06:11.211
who has a foreign accent,
and whisks her away
to exotic pIaces,

06:11.284 --> 06:14.720
and has passion and has
the cutest IittIe dimpIes
you have ever seen.

06:14.788 --> 06:16.619
I have to add that
onto my checkIist.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.385
Lane. Stop it.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.188
She has Rodrigo,
and what do I have?

06:21.261 --> 06:23.195
You have a pitch
meeting tomorrow.

06:23.263 --> 06:26.721
At a IittIe magazine
caIIed, um, Cosmo.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.166
What? Cosmo?
The greatest--

06:29.235 --> 06:30.793
Magazine of aII time?

06:30.870 --> 06:34.067
Oh, my God. Your
friend caIIed you
back? Are you serious?

06:34.140 --> 06:35.539
I'm serious!

06:35.608 --> 06:39.374
Joanne, you're the
greatest friend !
Oh, my God !

06:39.446 --> 06:43.143
Hey! I just got
a pitch meeting

06:43.216 --> 06:45.776
at Cosmo. Yeah.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.390
So, this is what
heaven looks like.

06:59.466 --> 07:02.026
It's a beautifuI
buiIding, isn't it?

07:03.603 --> 07:05.298
l love this crosswalk.

07:05.371 --> 07:08.033
lt's taking me
towards my future,
towards my dreams,

07:08.108 --> 07:11.976
towards the Cosmo editor
who is not only going to
buy one of my stories,

07:12.045 --> 07:14.343
but she's gonna
be blown away by--

07:14.414 --> 07:16.177
Whoa. Are you
aII right?

07:20.386 --> 07:22.047
All right, just
the legs.

07:22.122 --> 07:24.147
Turn Ieft. Let's
get the side.

07:24.224 --> 07:27.819
I'm pitching a story
to Kate at Cosmo.

07:27.894 --> 07:30.920
ReaIIy?

07:30.997 --> 07:33.158
H i, I'm Kate White.
You must be Lane.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.530
Yeah.

07:34.601 --> 07:36.796
Very nice to meet you.
Won't you foIIow me?

07:36.870 --> 07:39.566
Okay.

07:39.639 --> 07:43.006
How about wearing
boyfriend jeans when
you don't have a boyfriend?

07:43.076 --> 07:45.169
I mean, fabuIous
or faux pas?

07:46.746 --> 07:49.738
WeII, thank you so much
for coming in, Lane.

07:49.816 --> 07:53.081
How about a story
on statement coats?
I think this season--

07:53.153 --> 07:55.018
I'm so sorry, Lane.

07:55.088 --> 07:58.251
I Iiked your piece
for For Her magazine
and I Iove your enthusiasm,

07:58.324 --> 08:02.158
but unfortunateIy
at this time, we're
gonna pass.

08:02.228 --> 08:04.753
What if l just
write something
for you on spec and--

08:04.831 --> 08:08.392
I'm so sorry, Lane.
I wish I couId've
heIped you.

08:08.468 --> 08:11.528
Me, too. WeII, I guess
I'm gonna rush home

08:11.604 --> 08:15.005
and cuddIe up to
my imaginary boyfriend.

08:15.074 --> 08:18.373
You're preaching to
the choir. I know that
feeIing aII too weII.

08:18.444 --> 08:21.470
I doubt that,
but thanks for
saying it anyway.

08:21.548 --> 08:24.517
U h, don't
be so sure.

08:24.584 --> 08:27.519
I just got
dumped via B BM .

08:27.587 --> 08:29.214
What?

08:29.289 --> 08:31.883
He didn't even have
the decency to emaiI
me Iike the Iast guy.

08:31.958 --> 08:33.515
Were you into him?

08:33.592 --> 08:35.686
I mean, he was straight,
he opened doors for me

08:35.761 --> 08:39.323
and didn't Iive with
his mother. I haven't
met anybody better since.

08:39.399 --> 08:41.890
My girIfriend and I were
just taIking about that.

08:41.967 --> 08:45.927
I mean, fashion is great,
but there's no databIe
guys anywhere.

08:46.005 --> 08:49.406
I haven't even found
a guy with two items
on my checkIist.

08:49.475 --> 08:52.911
I have a checkIist, too.
Each year I don't find
the man of my dreams,

08:52.979 --> 08:54.970
I take another
item off the Iist.

08:55.048 --> 08:58.609
Pretty soon, that Iist
is gonna just be a bIank
piece of paper.

08:58.685 --> 09:02.951
And you can't cuddIe up
to a gift bag. I've tried.
It's reaIIy uncomfortabIe.

09:03.022 --> 09:06.719
You know what? It's
aImost Iike aII of the
eIigibIe guys in the city

09:06.793 --> 09:09.387
are hiding out in offices
downtown or something.

09:09.462 --> 09:13.660
Business schooI wouId've been
boring, but at Ieast by now
we wouId've had some guy--

09:13.733 --> 09:16.327
Wait. There's
a story here.

09:16.402 --> 09:19.860
Joining the business
worId to find Iove.

09:19.939 --> 09:22.703
If you're gonna do this,
you're gonna do this
aII the way.

09:22.775 --> 09:24.970
Oh, my God.
Cosmo wants me.

09:25.044 --> 09:28.536
You're gonna switch careers,
you're going into the worId
of business

09:28.615 --> 09:30.412
and you're gonna
take your Iist with you.

09:30.483 --> 09:32.576
Switch careers,
bring my Iist.

09:32.652 --> 09:34.950
Once you have
a job undercover
in the business worId,

09:35.021 --> 09:37.455
you are gonna
find a man that has
every item on that Iist.

09:37.523 --> 09:38.922
The magic man.

09:38.992 --> 09:41.017
It's gonna be
a great story.

09:41.094 --> 09:44.325
l'm undercover. l'll be like
that girl who pretended
to be Playboy bunny.

09:44.397 --> 09:46.558
You'II be Iike
Woodward and Bernstein.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.328
Yes, yes! Or Iike
that girI who--

09:48.401 --> 09:50.426
I'm taking a chance
on you, Lane,

09:50.503 --> 09:53.802
so I don't want
you saying yes unIess
you can reaIIy puII this off.

09:53.873 --> 09:57.309
You have to get a reaI
business job and you have
to date men in suits.

09:57.377 --> 09:59.072
Yeah, it'II be
my new mantra.

09:59.145 --> 10:01.170
''Men in suits.
Men in suits. ''

10:01.247 --> 10:02.680
Lane.

10:02.749 --> 10:04.182
Yeah. Sorry.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.844
You can date
no one else.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.854
Nobody.

10:08.922 --> 10:11.015
Remember,
this is Cosmo.

10:11.090 --> 10:12.819
I know.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.796
I know.

10:21.067 --> 10:24.230
This story is going
to make Lane Daniels.

10:24.304 --> 10:26.568
l'll work at some
huge investment bank,

10:26.639 --> 10:29.904
meet a gorgeous,
suit-wearing guy and
fall madly in love.

10:29.976 --> 10:34.037
l'm writing my first
article for Cosmo. How
did l get so lucky?

10:36.849 --> 10:38.441
Lane DanieIs.

10:38.518 --> 10:41.112
Oh. Yes, that's me.

10:41.187 --> 10:43.553
You're Lane DanieIs?

10:43.623 --> 10:45.250
Yeah.

10:45.325 --> 10:47.486
You have a very
impressive resume.

10:47.560 --> 10:52.156
l've never understood resumes.
They're just a contest to see
who can lie the most.

10:52.231 --> 10:54.290
FIuent in French,
Spanish, German.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.131
Oui. Si. Ja.

10:57.203 --> 11:00.229
And you're proficient
in ExceI and Powerpoint.

11:00.306 --> 11:02.672
Basic business tooIs.
Gotta Iove 'em.

11:02.742 --> 11:06.542
Oh, l just wanna kiss
the guy who invented Google.
l wonder if he wears a suit.

11:06.612 --> 11:09.137
WeII, today's interview
is for a support position

11:09.215 --> 11:12.912
in corporate
strategic pIanning
at Thompson FuIworth.

11:12.986 --> 11:17.582
WeII, as Iong as it's a
businessy-type job where
the guys wear suits.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.424
For a second,
I thought you
were serious.

11:23.496 --> 11:25.589
GirI, you had me going.

11:25.665 --> 11:29.567
WeII, you know what they say,
'' H umor pIus business makes
for funny business. ''

11:29.635 --> 11:32.001
GirI, you funny.

11:32.071 --> 11:34.232
Tom Reinhart,
Managing Director,

11:34.307 --> 11:36.332
meet Lane DanieIs.

11:36.409 --> 11:38.434
N ice to meet you.
PIease, have a seat.

11:42.915 --> 11:45.042
- Is this recycIed paper?
- Yeah.

11:45.118 --> 11:50.647
Very nice. You are more than
quaIified. Have you worked in
corporate strategic pIanning?

11:50.723 --> 11:53.317
Of course.
I've worked
in aII three.

11:53.393 --> 11:55.759
Her sense of humor.
You'll get used to it.

11:55.828 --> 11:57.693
l'm great
with interviews.

11:57.764 --> 12:00.597
l do this for a living.
l'm going to wow this guy

12:00.666 --> 12:02.861
with my knowledge
of the business world.

12:02.935 --> 12:06.336
Or maybe just compliment
him. And if l run
into any trouble,

12:06.406 --> 12:08.374
I'II just start
asking him questions.

12:08.441 --> 12:10.033
And have you used
deaI Reporter?

12:10.109 --> 12:13.078
DeaI Reporter.

12:13.146 --> 12:15.979
The deaI Reporter?
It's a great question, Tom.

12:16.049 --> 12:19.450
It's such a managing
director's question.

12:19.519 --> 12:21.214
That's a great tie.

12:21.287 --> 12:23.949
Now, did you
aIways know you wanted
to be in business?

12:24.023 --> 12:26.685
Oh, aIways.
How about you?

12:26.759 --> 12:28.920
How about I what?

12:28.995 --> 12:31.395
AIways wanted
to go into business?

12:31.464 --> 12:33.227
Oh, of course.

12:33.299 --> 12:35.631
I Iove the way peopIe
Iook aII dressed up.

12:35.701 --> 12:38.169
I think I'm beginning
to get that sense of humor.

12:38.237 --> 12:40.034
I toId you.

12:40.106 --> 12:44.304
I hope the saIary
works for you. We'II
start you at 4 2.

12:44.377 --> 12:46.845
Forty-two thousand?

12:46.913 --> 12:48.403
Yeah, I can
Iive with that.

12:48.481 --> 12:49.971
Like a queen.

12:50.049 --> 12:52.517
We have a deaI.
We'II see you Monday
30.

12:52.585 --> 12:54.052
I can't wait.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.849
Thanks. She'II
be great.

12:55.922 --> 12:58.083
Good seeing you, Tom.

12:58.157 --> 13:01.149
That was easy enough.
Hey, thanks for
hooking me up.

13:01.227 --> 13:04.526
U h-uh, not so fast.
We stiII need to get
you tested on the software.

13:06.632 --> 13:09.328
Click once to begin.
Good luck.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.908
So, this is what
deal Reporter looks like.

13:16.976 --> 13:20.468
This is very bad.

13:20.546 --> 13:22.946
Hey. Hey, you've
got to heIp me.

13:23.015 --> 13:24.949
I couId get you free
Laura Merceir sampIes.

13:25.017 --> 13:26.985
Can you pIease be quiet?

13:30.857 --> 13:34.691
Hey, you Iike these shoes?
'Cause I can teII you where
to get them on saIe.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.523
I'm not gonna
heIp you cheat.

13:36.596 --> 13:38.689
Oh, she's so helpful.

13:43.136 --> 13:45.969
Oh, that's not right.

13:49.242 --> 13:52.905
Oh, that's not right.
Go back. Go back.

13:52.979 --> 13:55.038
God ! You stupid
thing. Come on.

13:55.114 --> 13:56.479
Sh !

13:56.549 --> 13:58.540
WeII, how do
I go back?

13:58.618 --> 14:03.646
You can't. You either know
this stuff or you don't.
And my guess is you don't.

14:03.723 --> 14:06.157
Somebody has
Iow bIood sugar.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.284
Here, have some candy.

14:10.296 --> 14:11.820
I don't eat sugar.

14:11.898 --> 14:15.265
H m.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.202
l can't fail this test.

14:44.664 --> 14:45.961
Ooh.

14:59.445 --> 15:01.208
Oh.

15:04.183 --> 15:06.151
Oops.

15:08.221 --> 15:11.679
It's too bad
about those Iights.
I was naiIing that test.

15:11.757 --> 15:14.317
How about you?

15:14.393 --> 15:16.861
We don't have time
to retest you
before Monday,

15:16.929 --> 15:20.797
but you swear that you
trained in aII the financiaI
software we taIked about?

15:20.866 --> 15:23.266
Oh, deaI Reporter
is my middIe name.

15:23.336 --> 15:25.736
AII right.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.330
Yeah l

15:28.407 --> 15:30.773
Thank you
guys so much.

15:30.843 --> 15:33.744
I gotta say
I'm so nervous
about tomorrow.

15:33.813 --> 15:37.214
I'm waIking into a
job at an investment
company. Me.

15:37.283 --> 15:39.581
I don't know the first
thing about investing.

15:39.652 --> 15:42.314
Sure you do.
You know fashion, right?

15:42.388 --> 15:43.980
Yeah, but what does
that have to do--

15:44.056 --> 15:46.820
You know how
the spring coIIection
is introduced in the faII

15:46.892 --> 15:50.089
and the best designers
know what is gonna seII
months ahead of time?

15:50.162 --> 15:52.722
Yeah. I mean,
I've been tracking
those trends for years.

15:52.798 --> 15:55.699
ExactIy. So, you
just repIace the
shoes and dresses

15:55.768 --> 16:00.330
with stocks and companies
and it's aII about predicting
trends, what peopIe wanna buy.

16:00.406 --> 16:02.067
Whoa. That's impressive.

16:02.141 --> 16:05.338
That is seIfish, actuaIIy,
because I figure the more
I heIp you,

16:05.411 --> 16:07.777
the sooner you become
a big writer for Cosmo,

16:07.847 --> 16:11.146
the more assignments l
get. Let's not forget.
AII about me.

16:11.217 --> 16:12.809
But I want it
to be aII about me.

16:12.885 --> 16:15.410
Wait a minute.
I thought it was
aII about me.

16:15.488 --> 16:19.083
M m, you're right.
It is, because we
got you

16:19.158 --> 16:21.183
a present for
your first day.

16:21.260 --> 16:22.659
Get outta here.

16:22.728 --> 16:24.696
We were gonna get
you a gorgeous C E O,

16:24.764 --> 16:28.666
but most of them are either
in jail or getting government
bailouts, so.

16:28.734 --> 16:32.135
lf you're going
to play the part,
you need to look the part.

16:32.204 --> 16:37.005
This is amazing.
Are you serious?
Thank you so much.

16:37.076 --> 16:38.805
To our future C E O.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.709
To our future C E O.

16:49.555 --> 16:52.422
All right, Lane.
This is your moment.

16:54.026 --> 16:55.254
Seize it.

17:07.373 --> 17:09.704
Oh, my God.

17:10.608 --> 17:13.544
So many men.

17:13.612 --> 17:15.739
And l get my pick.

17:15.815 --> 17:18.113
Men with ties.
Men without ties.

17:18.184 --> 17:21.744
Men with ties tossed
over their shoulders.
Tall men. Short men.

17:21.820 --> 17:26.019
Men with glasses. Men without
glasses. Men standing,
sitting, walking, running,

17:26.092 --> 17:29.118
bending over
to pick things up.
Blind men. Strong men.

17:29.195 --> 17:31.595
Gorgeous men.
Two-piece. Three-piece.

17:31.664 --> 17:34.132
ls there a
four-piece?
Who cares?

17:34.200 --> 17:37.067
So many men in suitsl

17:37.136 --> 17:40.936
l just got hired by
Cosmo, the world's
greatest magazine,

17:41.006 --> 17:44.567
to go undercover and
date hot men in suits.

17:44.643 --> 17:47.009
Does it get any
better than this?

17:59.959 --> 18:01.654
How's it going?

18:01.727 --> 18:04.924
I never understood
the phrase ''kid in a
candy store'' untiI today.

18:04.997 --> 18:06.328
Lots of men
in suits?

18:06.399 --> 18:08.993
Joanne, thank you so
much for setting this up.

18:09.068 --> 18:12.936
Hey, l just made a couple
of calls. You're the one who
has to write the article.

18:13.005 --> 18:16.270
You know, the business
worId Iooks a Iot Iike
heaven to me.

18:16.342 --> 18:18.139
Heaven in a tie.

18:18.210 --> 18:18.972
Yum.

18:19.044 --> 18:20.170
M iss DanieIs.

18:20.246 --> 18:22.009
I'II caII
you in five.

18:22.081 --> 18:24.515
Ah. Time is money.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.050
H i, I'm Lane.

18:26.118 --> 18:28.609
H i, John.
I'm part of the team.
You, me and Tom.

18:28.687 --> 18:30.678
Oh. I'm a part
of a team?

18:30.756 --> 18:32.849
Yeah, Iike in junior
high. BasketbaII.

18:32.925 --> 18:36.417
Except I was kicked
off the team.

18:36.495 --> 18:41.831
Anyway, uh, so you're gonna
be handIing Tom's traveI,
caIendar, expenses.

18:41.901 --> 18:45.598
l'm part of a team. l hope
the uniforms are cute.

18:45.671 --> 18:49.129
Paperwork and, uh,
profit research
and everything.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.971
Come on, Iet's, uh,
go get your I . D.

18:51.043 --> 18:52.806
Great.

18:57.516 --> 19:00.178
If you Iike that I . D. ,
you're gonna Iove
the cubicIe.

19:00.252 --> 19:02.777
Oh. I get my
own cubicIe?

19:02.855 --> 19:05.517
First thing in the morning.
J ust give them to Jack.

19:05.591 --> 19:07.786
Hey, Tom.
Hey, how's it going?

19:07.860 --> 19:09.054
Fine. How are you?

19:09.128 --> 19:11.028
Great. Everything's great.

19:11.096 --> 19:12.961
You Iook nice.

19:13.032 --> 19:15.330
Thanks.
So do you.

19:15.401 --> 19:17.699
Do l recognize
that shirt from
the interview?

19:17.770 --> 19:20.568
U h, no, you recognize
its brother or sister.

19:20.639 --> 19:24.370
lt's the same shirt but not
the exact same. You see,
l have a number of these,

19:24.443 --> 19:26.604
the same but not
the same same.

19:26.679 --> 19:28.704
Got it.
Different shirt.

19:28.781 --> 19:31.215
Well, it's nice.
l can see why you
bought two of them.

19:31.283 --> 19:34.116
ActuaIIy, I bought six.
One for each day of
the week and--

19:34.186 --> 19:37.383
And a spare
for laundry day.
lt's a great idea.

19:37.456 --> 19:39.651
Let's start the tour.

19:39.725 --> 19:44.094
The department downstairs makes
modeIs that study economic
trends. They forecast--

19:44.163 --> 19:47.963
What peopIe
are gonna buy?
Like fashion designers.

19:48.033 --> 19:49.830
Yeah, I guess it is.

19:49.902 --> 19:51.836
A reaIIy great idea.

19:51.904 --> 19:55.305
They're a pretty good
department. Sometimes when we
have concerns after a merger

19:55.374 --> 19:57.774
or a major consoIidation,
these guys make sure

19:57.843 --> 20:00.937
that the company has a
reaIIy easy transition
in the next phase.

20:01.013 --> 20:03.208
The past coupIe years
have been a IittIe crazy.

20:03.282 --> 20:06.251
l've always found it
boring when guys talk
about business,

20:06.318 --> 20:08.548
but Tom makes it
kind of interesting.

20:08.621 --> 20:13.024
Six shirts all
the same. Weird.

20:13.092 --> 20:15.287
And this department
manages our hedge funds.

20:15.361 --> 20:19.263
l nod a lot and act
impressed as l survey
the men-in-suits situation.

20:19.331 --> 20:21.492
As unbelievable
as it sounds,

20:21.567 --> 20:24.798
the majority of guys
here are single.

20:24.870 --> 20:28.966
No photos of families
or crayon drawings
from their kids.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.838
And as if it couldn't
get any better,

20:30.910 --> 20:33.970
the few women here,
they're not even trying.

20:34.046 --> 20:35.673
So, what do you think?

20:35.748 --> 20:37.682
There are so many men.

20:37.750 --> 20:41.049
That's what they aII say.
But after a whiIe, you
hardIy notice.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.088
This is your desk.

20:43.155 --> 20:45.419
Oh ! I Iove it!

20:45.491 --> 20:48.324
Okay. WeII,
happy birthday.

20:48.394 --> 20:50.419
Oh, this chair
is perfect.

20:50.496 --> 20:53.329
My own cubicle.
lt's paradise.

20:53.399 --> 20:57.062
Okay, weII, enjoy your chair.
I wiII be in my office which
is right over here.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.297
Sure.

20:59.371 --> 21:01.271
Why doesn't
my chair spin?

21:01.340 --> 21:04.138
Does your chair spin?

21:04.209 --> 21:05.233
Yeah.

21:05.311 --> 21:06.335
Yes?

21:06.412 --> 21:07.310
Yep.

21:11.050 --> 21:12.312
StiII going weII?

21:12.384 --> 21:15.717
Yes. I have a swanky
new cubicIe, Joanne.

21:15.788 --> 21:19.155
I'm on my work phone
being aII businessy.

21:19.224 --> 21:21.954
I'm Iike Anne Hathaway
in The Devil Wears Prada.

21:22.027 --> 21:25.394
l hope my boss
isn't evil. But now
all l have to do--

21:28.901 --> 21:31.893
Is to coIIate
and distribute
the documents

21:31.971 --> 21:34.496
and I'II check
back in with you.

21:34.573 --> 21:35.835
Here you go.

21:35.908 --> 21:39.435
Thompson & FuIworth
has secret handshakes?

21:39.511 --> 21:41.172
No, they're
hand signals.

21:41.246 --> 21:43.840
Our traders use
them on the floor
but l adapted them.

21:43.916 --> 21:48.012
You and I can gesture without
having to worry about noise
or using another Iine.

21:48.087 --> 21:51.215
lt's more efficient.
Like, conference call,
l'm leaving the office,

21:51.290 --> 21:52.723
I'II return
the caII Iater.

21:52.791 --> 21:55.555
And that means okay.

21:55.628 --> 21:57.289
I'II Iearn these
right away.

21:57.363 --> 21:59.797
Okay, this is a Iist
of frequent caIIers.

21:59.865 --> 22:02.356
This group, apoIogize,
I'm in a meeting.

22:02.434 --> 22:06.598
This group, put them into
the queue. And these two, you
put them through right away.

22:06.672 --> 22:09.869
It's the C E O
and my mom.

22:11.176 --> 22:13.167
That means I'm on it.

22:21.353 --> 22:22.650
Oh, my God.

22:22.721 --> 22:24.086
What?

22:24.156 --> 22:26.317
More men.

22:28.627 --> 22:30.390
What's good here?

22:30.462 --> 22:33.863
I'm not reaIIy the guy
to ask. I get the same
thing every day.

22:33.932 --> 22:35.866
Every day?
What is it?

22:35.934 --> 22:40.166
Chicken breast with waInuts
and pIain yogurt. This meaI
boosts neurotransmitters,

22:40.239 --> 22:44.835
baIances omega acids and
I don't have to waste time
deciding what I want to eat.

22:44.910 --> 22:47.435
WeII, how
does it taste?

22:47.513 --> 22:49.447
Let me guess.
Efficient.

22:49.515 --> 22:51.915
AII right, smartass.
Tour's over.

22:51.984 --> 22:53.417
Where are you going?

22:53.485 --> 22:55.385
Back to my office.
I aIways eat up there--

22:55.454 --> 22:57.649
It's a more efficient
use of your time?

22:57.723 --> 23:00.021
You catch on quick.

23:05.664 --> 23:07.529
Okay.

23:11.904 --> 23:15.396
No. No, no!

23:16.608 --> 23:19.736
Oh, God,
you stupid--
Come on.

23:19.812 --> 23:23.077
Don't you know what
you're supposed to do
when the copier breaks?

23:25.050 --> 23:27.814
What's that?

23:27.886 --> 23:29.945
Run away.

23:30.022 --> 23:34.118
I'm serious. Otherwise everyone
wiII know you're the Ioser who
couIdn't fix the copier.

23:34.193 --> 23:37.720
Right. And who's
the Ioser who currentIy
hoIds that position here?

23:37.796 --> 23:40.788
Danny GoId in Accounting.
Three months running.

23:40.866 --> 23:44.324
But, since you're
new, I'II heIp you.

23:44.403 --> 23:46.928
Step aside.

23:47.005 --> 23:48.996
For the record though,
I was never here.

23:49.074 --> 23:52.100
We never met
and I have no idea
how to use this thing.

23:52.177 --> 23:54.543
Got it.
I'm Lane,
by the way.

23:54.613 --> 23:57.309
Hey, Lane.
I'm Seth.

23:57.382 --> 24:00.317
l normally don't
like guys who know
they're cute,

24:00.385 --> 24:03.684
but Seth's
really cute.

24:05.991 --> 24:07.549
This never happened.

24:07.626 --> 24:11.357
I saw nothing.
Yum's the word.

24:11.430 --> 24:15.457
M um's the word.
Oh, God. Stupid.

24:18.003 --> 24:19.470
Good morning.

24:23.342 --> 24:26.436
This place is crawling
with potential magic men.

24:28.447 --> 24:31.939
Once they start asking
me out, l can write this
article in a week.

24:43.061 --> 24:45.655
Lane, what's this?

24:45.731 --> 24:48.393
A diagram.
An office diagram

24:48.467 --> 24:51.868
to show the key
empIoyees, so I can
better serve you.

24:51.937 --> 24:54.201
WeII, you're just fuII
of surprises, aren't you?

24:54.273 --> 24:58.676
I doubIe-checked your
00 p. m. reservation.
Is Whitney a cIient?

24:58.744 --> 25:02.180
No, she's my girIfriend.
It's Monday night.
It's date night.

25:02.247 --> 25:06.411
Hey, Whitney, come here.
I want you to meet my
new assistant, Lane.

25:06.485 --> 25:08.578
Eekl Draggy nailsl

25:08.654 --> 25:09.848
PIeasure.

25:09.922 --> 25:11.150
Ugh, bird grab.

25:11.223 --> 25:14.056
Charmed.

25:14.126 --> 25:16.458
Tom, I'm starving.
Can we pIease go now?

25:16.528 --> 25:19.588
Okay, hon.
WeII, I'II see
you in the morning.

25:19.665 --> 25:20.893
Okay.

25:20.966 --> 25:22.160
Night, John.

25:22.234 --> 25:24.429
H i, John.

25:24.503 --> 25:26.528
Weird handshake, huh?

25:26.605 --> 25:28.869
Did it feeI Iike
a predatory bird?

25:28.941 --> 25:31.239
Can't decide
if I Iike it or not.

25:32.544 --> 25:34.876
Lane, right?
Hi, l'm Eddie.

25:34.947 --> 25:37.745
WeIcome to Thompson
& FuIworth.

25:37.816 --> 25:40.614
I was wondering
if you couId grab a drink
with me tomorrow night?

25:40.686 --> 25:42.984
I wouId Iove to.

25:43.055 --> 25:46.786
They're drawn to me
like moths to a flame.

25:46.859 --> 25:50.420
l'm the best undercover
journalist in the history
of the world.

26:01.106 --> 26:03.267
Hey, go aIready.
It's your turn.

26:03.342 --> 26:04.832
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

26:04.910 --> 26:06.775
Are you thinking
or fantasizing?

26:08.447 --> 26:12.383
Okay, Okay. Do you
have one phenomenaIIy
tanned six-pack?

26:12.451 --> 26:14.612
I do have
one phenomenaIIy
tanned six-pack.

26:14.686 --> 26:18.087
Yes! How about
super hot guy
in a toweI?

26:18.156 --> 26:20.647
Go fish.

26:20.726 --> 26:23.991
Okay, do you have a
perfectIy shaped butt?

26:24.062 --> 26:26.087
You know l do.

26:26.164 --> 26:27.825
I n your hand.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.425
Oh, I have that, too.
Okay, okay, it's
my turn.

26:30.502 --> 26:33.938
Do you have one
rocking set of abs?

26:34.006 --> 26:36.736
I do.

26:36.808 --> 26:39.333
Oh, Ian.
Now, that's a six-pack
I'd Iike to forget.

26:39.411 --> 26:41.106
You know who that is?

26:41.179 --> 26:42.737
You can't even
see his face.

26:42.814 --> 26:44.645
Don't need to.
l remember that body.

26:44.716 --> 26:47.685
Joanne, you work
with these hot guys
every day aII day.

26:47.753 --> 26:49.516
How do I get your job?

26:49.588 --> 26:53.422
I don't know how
M r. Six-pack wouId
fare on the checkIist.

26:53.492 --> 26:56.222
She has that checkIist
to heIp her find
her souI mate.

26:56.295 --> 26:57.990
Where did this
Iist come from?

26:58.063 --> 27:00.531
Every romantic comedy
Lane's ever watched.

27:00.599 --> 27:02.430
That's not true.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.628
Okay, it's mostIy true.

27:04.703 --> 27:07.069
I just want to
find my magic man.

27:07.139 --> 27:10.370
Magic man.
She thinks that a guy
is gonna solve everything.

27:10.442 --> 27:13.843
I don't think it's gonna
soIve everything. I just
wanna meet a guy

27:13.912 --> 27:16.676
that, you know,
I'm happy to wake
up to every morning

27:16.748 --> 27:19.080
and that makes
time drift away.

27:19.151 --> 27:20.880
I want aII
of those things.

27:20.953 --> 27:25.822
And if he happens to have
a perfect set of abs,
I'II take that, too.

27:25.891 --> 27:27.620
I don't bIame you.

27:27.693 --> 27:30.161
Order one for me.

27:30.228 --> 27:31.661
To butts and abs.

27:31.730 --> 27:33.322
To butts and abs.

27:42.474 --> 27:43.941
WeIcome to day
two, Ab Fab.

27:44.009 --> 27:45.738
Ab Fab?

27:45.811 --> 27:49.303
Yeah, I was just trying out
a new nickname for you.
You Iike fashion.

27:49.381 --> 27:51.212
That's a show about
fashion, right?

27:51.283 --> 27:54.116
That is so much better than
my college nickname, ''Lame. ''

27:54.186 --> 27:55.881
You ever had
a nickname?

27:55.954 --> 27:57.888
Nope.

28:14.339 --> 28:16.330
Lane! Pay attention.

28:16.408 --> 28:18.000
I am.

28:18.076 --> 28:19.202
To me.

28:19.277 --> 28:21.905
Gotcha.

28:32.791 --> 28:35.259
No, that means
return the caII.

28:35.327 --> 28:37.557
I know. I know.
I knew that.

28:41.466 --> 28:43.661
Working in big business
can be stressful,

28:43.735 --> 28:45.965
but l'm gonna get
the hang of it.

29:08.827 --> 29:11.022
Life at the
investment bank is fun.

29:11.096 --> 29:14.031
l get to make my cubicle
beautiful and creative.

29:15.634 --> 29:18.831
And l get to
date a bunch.

29:20.472 --> 29:22.633
These guys actually have
items on my checklist.

29:22.707 --> 29:25.904
So far, just two
or three items each,

29:25.977 --> 29:28.878
but that's two
or three more than
in the fashion world.

29:36.421 --> 29:38.616
My magic man
is out there.

29:38.690 --> 29:40.783
l can feel it.

29:50.602 --> 29:53.628
You've already found eight
guys who could be the one?

29:53.705 --> 29:56.640
l know. Put a man in a
suit and things happen.

29:56.708 --> 29:59.939
H m, I guess we can
safeIy cross the junior
anaIyst off the Iist.

30:00.011 --> 30:04.641
What about that guy Seth?
The one who fixed the copier.
Get him to ask you out.

30:04.716 --> 30:09.119
My editor is so cool.
She's forcing me to
flirt with Seth.

30:09.187 --> 30:11.212
Could life get
any better?

30:11.289 --> 30:12.722
Hey.

30:12.791 --> 30:14.486
Hey.

30:16.528 --> 30:19.725
Get Seth to ask
me out? Watch me work.

30:19.798 --> 30:21.163
How are you?

30:21.233 --> 30:22.757
I'm good.
How are you?

30:22.834 --> 30:26.395
What is wrong
with this guy?
Take the bait.

30:26.471 --> 30:27.995
Lane.

30:28.073 --> 30:29.540
And here we go.

30:29.608 --> 30:31.974
You're not here
to ask me about
the copier, are you?

30:32.043 --> 30:34.477
I don't know anything
about copiers, remember?

30:34.546 --> 30:38.505
Yeah. No, I'm not
here to ask you
about the copier.

30:38.583 --> 30:41.518
l bet he's a great
kisser. Sometimes
you just know.

30:41.586 --> 30:43.520
Are you not
getting your maiI?

30:43.588 --> 30:46.455
'Cause either that
new maiI guy is the
Iaziest ever or--

30:46.525 --> 30:49.653
No, my maiI is fine.
MaiI's aII good.

30:49.728 --> 30:51.559
Oh, good.

30:57.435 --> 30:59.335
Hey, Lane.

30:59.404 --> 31:02.396
I was wondering if
you'd Iike to get
a drink sometime.

31:02.474 --> 31:04.533
I thought
you'd never ask.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.619
How is the article going?
Have you started writing?

31:18.690 --> 31:22.558
M m, I'm stiII in the research
phase. But I have a date with
Seth this Thursday.

31:22.627 --> 31:25.562
I know. I feeI Iike
he's gonna do reaIIy
weII on my checkIist.

31:25.630 --> 31:27.222
Good, 'cause you said he
has fashion sense, right?

31:27.299 --> 31:28.926
He does.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.230
Is he spontaneous?
Does he take exotic
trips on a whim?

31:31.303 --> 31:32.770
M m, I don't know, yet.

31:32.837 --> 31:34.862
Does he put passion
above common sense?

31:34.940 --> 31:36.771
Witty statements on
the tip of his tongue?

31:36.841 --> 31:38.399
Sort of, yeah.

31:38.476 --> 31:40.103
Sexy accent?

31:40.178 --> 31:43.477
That wouId be a no.
But he is fearIess
in the face of danger.

31:43.548 --> 31:45.140
What happened?

31:45.217 --> 31:48.015
He saved me from
the copier. It was
getting out of controI.

31:48.086 --> 31:50.054
The thing was
Iike eating my--

31:50.121 --> 31:51.918
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.652
No, it's aII right.
It's aII right.

31:56.861 --> 31:59.125
Do you have the time?

31:59.197 --> 32:01.222
Beautiful and
a sexy accent.

32:01.299 --> 32:03.665
Wait, what did
he just ask me?
Oh, the time.

32:03.735 --> 32:06.329
U m, yes, it's 6:4 2.

32:06.404 --> 32:09.134
Great, then I have
just enough time

32:09.207 --> 32:13.109
to Iet you spiII one more
drink on me before my dinner
meeting. What'II it be?

32:13.178 --> 32:15.339
I mean, shouIdn't I
be the one buying
you a drink?

32:15.413 --> 32:18.075
No, I'm rather
enjoying things
in the current state.

32:18.149 --> 32:21.346
You feeI guiIty
for making me Iook
as though I've wet myseIf,

32:21.419 --> 32:24.479
and you've no choice
but to sit here with me
tiII I finish my drink.

32:24.556 --> 32:26.421
It's the onIy
poIite thing to do.

32:28.493 --> 32:32.020
Polite
or infatuated?
You decide.

32:32.097 --> 32:36.864
Okay, when you put it
Iike that, I wiII have
another pomegranate martini.

32:36.935 --> 32:38.527
Two.

32:38.603 --> 32:42.130
So, do you Iadies spiII
your drinks on innocent
men for fun

32:42.207 --> 32:45.005
or is it a professionaI
sort of thing?

32:45.076 --> 32:47.135
No. ActuaIIy,
um, I'm a writer.

32:47.212 --> 32:49.578
U ndercover, trying
to find the love
of my life.

32:49.648 --> 32:52.708
Named Lane. My name
is Lane. And this--

32:52.784 --> 32:54.513
What if he likes
her more than me?

32:54.586 --> 32:56.417
Is my friend
who has a boyfriend.

32:56.488 --> 32:58.718
Creep. l'm such
a sixth grader.

32:58.790 --> 33:02.624
Who has a boyfriend?
I've never heard
that name before.

33:02.694 --> 33:06.687
Oh, yeah, it's been in
my famiIy for generations,
but friends caII me Joanne.

33:06.765 --> 33:08.926
Liam.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.059
Liam, are you
in finance?

33:11.136 --> 33:15.539
Oh, no, no, thank God.
No, I used to be a
guitarist, but now--

33:15.607 --> 33:17.905
SeriousIy?
What band?

33:17.976 --> 33:22.276
No, those days are Iong gone.
Now I sit on the other
side of the gIass.

33:22.347 --> 33:24.611
Lane, l'm not
leaving this seat

33:24.683 --> 33:27.652
untiI you agree
to have dinner with
me next Thursday night.

33:27.719 --> 33:29.710
Dinner? Oh.

33:29.788 --> 33:32.757
I Iove you.

33:32.824 --> 33:37.818
I mean, I'd Iove to.
I-I can't wait. Yes.

33:37.896 --> 33:39.830
WeII, that's great.
if I couId just--

33:39.898 --> 33:41.388
Here's her number.

33:43.668 --> 33:45.533
A pIeasure.

33:45.603 --> 33:47.400
Cheers.

33:49.007 --> 33:51.840
Okay, I'm reaIIy
sorry about the
whoIe boyfriend thing.

33:51.910 --> 33:56.540
I wouId have done the exact
same thing. I thought you
had to date a guy in a suit.

33:56.614 --> 33:58.479
Liam.

33:59.317 --> 34:03.583
Some of the lessons l'm
learning for my article are
more obvious than others.

34:03.655 --> 34:08.489
Like it is impossible
to imagine wearing sexy
lingerie for an accountant.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.619
As Iong as you itemize
your deductions--

34:10.695 --> 34:13.425
Where's the craziest
pIace you've ever
had sex?

34:15.233 --> 34:19.636
WeII, one time in
coIIege. I did it on
the Iiving room carpet.

34:19.704 --> 34:21.672
Oh.

34:27.712 --> 34:31.112
You know what?
You are way too
sexuaI for me.

34:31.181 --> 34:36.380
Oh, excuse me.
Hey, can I ask
you for a favor?

34:46.598 --> 34:48.429
Lane.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.060
Tom. How do you
Iike what I've done
with the pIace?

34:51.136 --> 34:52.659
Oh, it's quite festive.

34:52.737 --> 34:54.500
I'm gIad you Iike it.

34:54.572 --> 34:57.735
The beads bIock the
sight Iine from my office
to the rest of the fIoor.

34:57.809 --> 35:00.437
You know, they are made
from recycIed gIass.

35:00.512 --> 35:04.073
I mean, I know I'm no
sandaIs-wearing, guitar
pIaying, tree hugger--

35:04.149 --> 35:06.083
I am.

35:06.151 --> 35:07.709
You are?

35:07.786 --> 35:10.846
Yeah. I mean, we wear
shoes here and I pIay
the harmonica.

35:10.922 --> 35:12.685
HoId on. You pIay
the harmonica?

35:12.757 --> 35:15.021
I did. StrictIy
summer camp thing.

35:15.093 --> 35:18.028
So, to be more
accurate, I guess
I am a shoe-wearing,

35:18.096 --> 35:19.961
ex-harmonica-pIaying
tree hugger.

35:20.031 --> 35:22.829
I mean, I'm not
M r. save-the-fuzzy
bunnies or anything.

35:22.901 --> 35:25.836
I just cannot toIerate
wasting resources.

35:25.904 --> 35:27.337
So, you hate bunnies?

35:27.405 --> 35:30.966
I do. I hate them.
They infuriate me.

35:31.042 --> 35:32.566
U h-huh.

35:32.644 --> 35:35.977
Okay, get back to work.
And take down these
beads, okay?

35:36.047 --> 35:38.174
Let's get going on
these caIIs, Lane.

35:38.249 --> 35:40.979
Okay.

35:41.052 --> 35:44.146
Hey, you stiII having
troubIe with your router?

35:44.222 --> 35:46.315
You know, I'm the tech
wizard around here.

35:46.391 --> 35:48.825
Not a bad wizard,
but a good one.

35:53.798 --> 35:55.857
John, what are
you doing?

35:55.934 --> 36:00.371
What? No, nothing.
No, I-I mean, I'm
doing something.

36:00.438 --> 36:03.874
Helping Lane with her--
Her router is broken,

36:03.942 --> 36:08.140
so l was just-- This
is my girlfriend, Margo. She
works up in equity ratings.

36:08.213 --> 36:10.238
John has a
girlfriend? Go, John.

36:10.315 --> 36:11.976
H i, Margo.

36:12.050 --> 36:15.747
H i, Lane. Are you
coming to Iunch, or are
you happier down there?

36:15.820 --> 36:18.755
Yes. I mean, no, no,
I'm not happier
down here.

36:18.823 --> 36:22.782
I'm coming to--
Oh, sorry. Yeah.
No, just caII,

36:22.861 --> 36:24.920
uh, l. T. and
they'll fix it.

36:24.996 --> 36:28.159
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks for trying.
Margo, uh,

36:28.233 --> 36:30.758
John's aIways
taIking about you.

36:30.835 --> 36:32.860
He is?

36:32.937 --> 36:37.169
Yeah. It's kind
of disgustingIy
sweet, actuaIIy.

36:39.744 --> 36:41.177
Thanks.

36:41.246 --> 36:43.305
Well, that was easy.

36:51.222 --> 36:52.484
Thank you.

36:52.557 --> 36:53.785
Thanks.

36:53.858 --> 36:55.883
Lane, to the pink
contents of that gIass

36:55.960 --> 36:59.327
staying where it ought
rather than on my Iap.

36:59.397 --> 37:01.365
Cheers to that.

37:01.432 --> 37:03.559
You Iook
absoIuteIy stunning.

37:03.635 --> 37:07.901
Thank you.
You don't Iook so bad
yourseIf, you know.

37:07.972 --> 37:11.703
PIeasure to see
you as aIways.
And the IoveIy Iady.

37:11.776 --> 37:13.403
This is Lane.

37:13.478 --> 37:15.537
Lucky you.
He never makes
time to date.

37:15.613 --> 37:17.740
You make me sound rather
IoneIy and pathetic.

37:17.815 --> 37:19.442
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean--

37:19.517 --> 37:22.782
No, it's aII right.
I come here whenever
I'm in New York.

37:22.854 --> 37:24.219
I'm often aIone.

37:24.289 --> 37:25.813
Or with your artists.

37:25.890 --> 37:27.152
Artists?

37:27.225 --> 37:28.590
I produce music.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.651
He runs his own IabeI.

37:30.728 --> 37:31.888
What?

37:31.963 --> 37:33.487
It's nothing.

37:33.565 --> 37:37.433
Can I get you
an appetizer?

37:37.502 --> 37:39.527
How about
some caIamari?

37:41.506 --> 37:43.133
That's great.

37:47.745 --> 37:50.236
Okay. So, what
kind of music
do you produce?

37:50.315 --> 37:52.408
Oh, no, no, no, Lane.
Let's taIk about you.

37:52.483 --> 37:54.348
I'm sure it's
much more interesting.

37:54.419 --> 37:57.217
Okay, but I don't
know how interesting
you're gonna--

37:57.288 --> 38:00.416
Nonsense. Who is
Lane Daniels?

38:00.491 --> 38:02.891
WeII,

38:02.961 --> 38:05.259
I enjoy Iong waIks
on the beach,

38:05.330 --> 38:07.628
kissing under
the moonIight,

38:07.699 --> 38:09.929
and the worId
of fashion.

38:10.001 --> 38:11.832
What a reIief.

38:11.903 --> 38:15.134
I thought you were gonna
say fun Ioving, a peopIe
person and a dog Iover.

38:15.206 --> 38:18.175
I am a dog Iover.
I've actuaIIy
rescued seven,

38:18.242 --> 38:20.836
but l don't like
playing games,

38:20.912 --> 38:25.542
and I've been toId
a few times that I'm
a first-rate kisser.

38:25.617 --> 38:27.949
I hope you don't
hate aII games.

38:28.019 --> 38:33.685
WeII, I onIy induIge
in those invoIving
feathers and chocoIate.

38:33.758 --> 38:37.660
I'm gonna have
to see if that's
on the dessert menu.

38:41.966 --> 38:43.627
Do you enjoy Europe?

38:43.701 --> 38:46.101
Oh, I've been desperateIy
wanting to go to Paris

38:46.170 --> 38:49.537
with my friends
for New Year's, but
tickets are so pricey.

38:49.607 --> 38:51.472
I Iove Paris.
Do you visit often?

38:51.542 --> 38:54.170
WeII, yeah,
in my dreams.

38:54.245 --> 38:56.543
You've never been?

38:56.614 --> 38:58.707
Lane, we must remedy
this immediateIy.

38:58.783 --> 39:00.683
Let's hop on
a pIane tonight.

39:00.752 --> 39:02.310
Yes, yes, yesl

39:03.888 --> 39:07.949
No. I've got
work. I can't.

39:08.026 --> 39:09.653
FIimsy excuse.

39:09.727 --> 39:12.423
Sounds Iike you're
dashing off to meet
another bIoke.

39:12.497 --> 39:14.158
Oh, he said bloke.

39:14.232 --> 39:18.828
You've busted me.
He's actuaIIy gonna be
here in a few minutes.

39:30.081 --> 39:31.844
You are breathtaking.

39:35.453 --> 39:36.852
I'II get you a cab.

39:40.892 --> 39:43.588
Seth l There is
another bloke.

39:43.661 --> 39:45.526
The article. Cosmo.

39:45.596 --> 39:46.961
Sweet dreams.

39:47.031 --> 39:50.398
Thank you.

39:50.468 --> 39:52.732
That's right. Nice.

39:52.804 --> 39:55.864
TiIt your head a IittIe.
Yes, nice, girI.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.033
Rapido. Rapido.

39:58.109 --> 40:01.670
Lane. Hey! Wow,
you've been on
a date.

40:01.746 --> 40:05.375
I was and it was amazing.
I've got another date
in Iike five minutes.

40:05.450 --> 40:07.145
You have another
date? Where?

40:07.218 --> 40:08.742
Sam's on 6th.

40:08.820 --> 40:10.481
You can't go
to Sam's Iike this.

40:10.555 --> 40:13.149
I know.
I need your
heIp. Come on.

40:19.964 --> 40:23.627
And ever since then
I promised myseIf I'd never
ride another horse again.

40:23.701 --> 40:25.498
I don't bIame you.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.299
WeII, maybe a pony.

40:27.371 --> 40:29.999
There's nothing wrong
with Seth, but he's
no Liam.

40:30.074 --> 40:31.666
Do you wanna go
for a nightcap?

40:31.743 --> 40:33.938
You know what?
I shouIdn't.

40:34.011 --> 40:36.172
I-I have a
busy day tomorrow.

40:36.247 --> 40:41.150
Yeah, I understand, but
I had a reaIIy good
time tonight, Lane.

40:41.219 --> 40:43.210
Yeah, I did, too.

40:43.287 --> 40:44.982
Thank you so
much for dinner.

40:50.528 --> 40:51.927
Let me get
you a cab.

40:51.996 --> 40:54.055
Thanks. Okay.

40:54.132 --> 40:58.466
Maybe l'm not the best
undercover journalist
after all.

41:03.508 --> 41:06.671
Seth and the other men
around me have become
a faceless blur.

41:06.744 --> 41:09.577
I'II send the cIearance
documents to London
right away.

41:09.647 --> 41:13.048
Did somebody say
London? Oh, it's
the land of Liam.

41:13.117 --> 41:14.982
Lane.

41:15.052 --> 41:17.850
Lane. Lanel

41:17.922 --> 41:21.016
This is the document
we're sending to Paris.

41:21.092 --> 41:24.858
You don't speak
French, do you?

41:24.929 --> 41:27.261
It depends on how
you define ''speak. ''

41:27.331 --> 41:29.231
l'm really
disappointed
in you, Lane.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.962
This would have
been disastrous if
l'd sent this out.

41:32.036 --> 41:33.298
I'm sorry.

41:33.371 --> 41:35.771
I've gotta
send an emaiI.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.866
So much for Seth
being fearless in
the face of danger.

41:38.943 --> 41:41.878
Your resume
was riddIed with
exaggerations, Lane.

41:43.714 --> 41:45.682
You don't type
1 20 words a minute,

41:45.750 --> 41:47.684
you don't have
a photographic memory,

41:47.752 --> 41:50.550
and you keep
dropping names
off my caII sheet.

41:50.621 --> 41:53.249
Oh, my God.
Are you firing me?

41:53.324 --> 41:58.193
l'm giving you
a warning. But l do
not tolerate lying.

41:58.262 --> 42:00.093
Now, get back to work.

42:04.936 --> 42:07.063
This is all Liam's fault,

42:07.138 --> 42:11.768
with his sexy accent
and his smile and his lips.

42:11.843 --> 42:14.209
Oh, those lips.

42:14.278 --> 42:17.611
Lane, stop it.
He's distracting
me from my work

42:17.682 --> 42:20.708
and completely
screwing up my
story for Cosmo.

42:20.785 --> 42:22.844
Oh, can't
think straight.

42:24.555 --> 42:26.546
Wait.

42:26.624 --> 42:29.923
l'll change my story.

42:44.876 --> 42:48.073
My story shouldn't
be about finding love
in the business world.

42:48.145 --> 42:50.841
l'm not good at
business stuff anyway.

42:50.915 --> 42:54.942
My story is going to be about
meeting the perfect guy when
you least expect it.

42:55.019 --> 42:58.079
Because you never know
when your magic man
is gonna find you.

42:58.155 --> 42:59.918
It's good, right?

42:59.991 --> 43:01.982
Lane, this is not
your college paper.

43:02.059 --> 43:04.789
This is not some crappy
blog that you can write
in your pajamas.

43:04.862 --> 43:08.059
And it sure as heII
isn't an articIe on shoes
for For Her magazine.

43:08.132 --> 43:10.600
It's Her Style,
but that's okay.

43:10.668 --> 43:13.660
Lane, this is
a cover story
for Cosmo.

43:13.738 --> 43:15.672
A cover story?

43:15.740 --> 43:18.903
Yes, it's
a cover story.

43:18.976 --> 43:20.739
l gave you the chance
of a lifetime.

43:20.811 --> 43:23.974
So, you are gonna
deIiver whether you
Iike it or not.

43:24.048 --> 43:27.745
This piece has absolutely
nothing to do with Liam,
so stop seeing him.

43:27.818 --> 43:29.615
This story is about
the business world.

43:29.687 --> 43:32.451
Get your butt back
to Thompson FuIworth
and un-quit.

43:32.523 --> 43:35.185
lf you're not good at
the business stuff,
get better.

43:35.259 --> 43:37.591
lf you can't find
the right guy in a
suit, look harder.

43:37.662 --> 43:41.154
You have two more weeks to
have an article about finding
love in the business world

43:41.232 --> 43:44.463
on my desk, and
it better be great.
Are we cIear?

43:44.535 --> 43:46.867
Yes.

43:49.240 --> 43:52.073
No Liam, get better,
work harder, date often.

43:52.143 --> 43:54.634
Ah ! sorry.

43:54.712 --> 43:55.974
Oh, hey, Lane?

43:56.047 --> 43:58.777
Drinks? Sure.
00
00.

44:02.153 --> 44:03.848
Lane?

44:03.921 --> 44:06.219
Tom.

44:06.290 --> 44:09.521
I was just turning out
your, um, office Iamp.

44:09.593 --> 44:11.322
I Ieft it on? ReaIIy?

44:11.395 --> 44:13.659
It must have
sIipped your mind.

44:13.731 --> 44:15.221
Oh. Lane?

44:16.367 --> 44:17.698
I'm on my way.

44:24.575 --> 44:26.475
l finally find
my magic man

44:26.544 --> 44:28.205
and l'm not
allowed to see him.

44:28.279 --> 44:31.043
Thank you.

44:31.115 --> 44:33.083
Something wrong, Lane?

44:33.150 --> 44:36.017
No, not whiIe
I'm with you.

44:38.489 --> 44:41.583
Liam, there's something
I have to teII you.

44:41.659 --> 44:45.095
It's reaIIy
difficuIt for me.

44:45.162 --> 44:47.357
See, I'm writing
this articIe and--

44:52.069 --> 44:55.334
It wouId be very
easy to faII in
Iove with you.

44:55.406 --> 44:57.840
What? ReaIIy?

44:57.908 --> 45:01.344
Yes, reaIIy.
You're stunning.
You're funny.

45:01.412 --> 45:03.710
My heart races
when I see you.

45:03.781 --> 45:07.615
And that dress
you're wearing, a bIoke
doesn't stand a chance.

45:07.685 --> 45:10.210
l know l'm supposed
to date a man in a suit,

45:10.287 --> 45:13.882
but Liam's a man
and he's falling
for me.

45:13.958 --> 45:15.926
At any rate,
I do have to
protect myseIf

45:15.993 --> 45:17.893
with a woman as
beautifuI as you.

45:17.962 --> 45:20.522
I'm afraid I've had
my heart broken before.

45:20.598 --> 45:22.293
Aw. TeII me
about it.

45:22.366 --> 45:23.833
No.

45:23.901 --> 45:27.530
Come on, you
can teII me.

45:27.605 --> 45:30.836
WeII, we'd been
together for years

45:30.908 --> 45:35.242
and, uh, I worshipped her.
I thought she worshipped me.

45:35.312 --> 45:39.908
We'd survived Iong distances,
parentaI disapprovaI,
a saiIing accident.

45:39.984 --> 45:41.281
A saiIing accident?

45:41.352 --> 45:43.149
That sounds more
dramatic than it was.

45:43.220 --> 45:46.485
Point is, I snuck out
earIy one Sunday morning
to buy eggs and caviar.

45:46.557 --> 45:49.355
You know, surprise
her with a IittIe
breakfast in bed.

45:49.427 --> 45:51.725
But I was the one
Ieft surprised.

45:51.796 --> 45:55.755
Tiptoed in to find
onIy a note. It said,

45:55.833 --> 45:58.324
'' I'm done. ''

45:58.402 --> 46:01.235
There is so much
pain in the world.

46:01.305 --> 46:05.935
l declare my one
mission in life, if it's
the last thing l do,

46:06.010 --> 46:08.501
l will heal Liam's
wounded heart.

46:17.154 --> 46:18.815
Dessert at your pIace?

46:18.889 --> 46:21.323
We couId.

46:21.392 --> 46:24.418
But I bet my pIace
isn't as Iuxurious
as yours.

46:24.495 --> 46:25.894
See, I--

46:32.837 --> 46:37.240
I wish I couId have
you over, but my
father's in town.

46:37.308 --> 46:41.836
So, unIess you want to share
some warm chocoIate and
creme fraiche with him--

46:41.912 --> 46:44.073
My pIace wiII be fine.

46:44.148 --> 46:45.308
Whoo!

46:52.356 --> 46:54.221
ShaII I get
some spoons?

46:54.291 --> 46:56.350
We won't be
needing any spoons.

47:01.732 --> 47:03.529
This is gonna be great.

47:03.601 --> 47:05.569
Maybe for you.

47:05.636 --> 47:07.467
It's Iike a
day at the spa.

47:07.538 --> 47:10.666
I nstead of the organic
heaIthy detoxifying seaweed,

47:10.741 --> 47:14.837
you're being
wrapped in. . . pIastic.

47:14.912 --> 47:17.779
WheeI her in.

47:17.848 --> 47:19.645
There you go.
Don't trip.

47:22.753 --> 47:24.880
Now, I want you to
show off the purse.

47:24.955 --> 47:28.391
I want you to touch it.
It's the Iove of
your Iife. Good.

47:28.459 --> 47:32.486
Good morning, Joanne,
and pIastic- wrapped modeIs.

47:32.563 --> 47:37.364
Oh ! Somebody Iooks Iike
the cat who ate the canary.

47:37.434 --> 47:39.959
More Iike the chocoIate.

47:40.037 --> 47:42.028
Were you with Liam?

47:42.106 --> 47:45.166
Yes, I was.
And must say
he's pretty skiIIed

47:45.242 --> 47:47.403
in the chocoIate and
Iove-making department.

47:47.478 --> 47:49.446
BeIgian?

47:49.513 --> 47:50.946
No no, he's British.

47:51.015 --> 47:52.710
No, the chocoIate.
was it BeIgian?

47:52.783 --> 47:54.580
Who cares?
It was deIicious.

47:54.652 --> 47:56.176
But all of
those calories.

47:56.253 --> 47:59.245
Oh, don't worry.
We burned them
off Iast night.

47:59.323 --> 48:01.052
Okay, wait wait, Lane.

48:01.125 --> 48:04.754
I thought that Kate
from Cosmo toId you
to stop seeing Liam.

48:04.828 --> 48:07.126
I have no idea what
you're taIking about.

48:07.198 --> 48:09.132
Lane?

48:09.200 --> 48:10.929
You know
I Iove you, but--

48:11.001 --> 48:13.629
ReIax, it's fine.

48:13.704 --> 48:15.137
What am I gonna
do with you?

48:15.206 --> 48:17.231
J ust Iove me
for who I am.

48:17.308 --> 48:18.866
Aw.

48:21.011 --> 48:22.979
Okay.

48:23.047 --> 48:27.143
I want you to stay stiII
exactIy Iike that. You know
how hot you Iook right now?

48:27.218 --> 48:28.913
Joanne.

48:28.986 --> 48:31.454
SeriousIy, I want you
to Iift up the purse.
J ust Iike you Iove it.

48:31.522 --> 48:33.422
Joanne, there's
a smaII probIem.

48:33.490 --> 48:35.321
Like it's your Iover.
You're running
away together.

48:35.392 --> 48:36.723
Joanne, I have to pee.

48:38.996 --> 48:42.557
AII right,
that's a probIem.
WheeI her out.

48:48.606 --> 48:52.235
That's why l'd like
to absorb those losses
now. l n two years--

48:52.309 --> 48:55.301
Don't taIk to me about
Iong-term growth.

48:57.748 --> 49:00.842
lf we're gonna
take the hit on
these properties,

49:00.918 --> 49:04.376
we're gonna need
to compensate by
selling other asses--

49:04.455 --> 49:06.821
Assets. SeII
other assets.

49:06.890 --> 49:09.859
Yeah, but--wow.

49:09.927 --> 49:12.657
l need serious
performance from your
division, gentlemen.

49:12.730 --> 49:15.494
This isn't a year
to skirt change--

49:15.566 --> 49:19.024
l mean, short change.
l'm a happily married man.

49:19.103 --> 49:21.298
M r. BeImont?

49:22.773 --> 49:24.331
Lane!

49:26.877 --> 49:29.641
Oh.

49:29.713 --> 49:31.112
H i there.

49:36.120 --> 49:38.748
I apoIogize for
the distraction, sir.

49:38.822 --> 49:40.653
No apoIogy necessary.

49:42.426 --> 49:45.862
Okay. Look, Liam
sounds amazing,
Lane, he does.

49:45.929 --> 49:48.193
But is he worth
risking everything over?

49:48.265 --> 49:50.859
He pIaces passion
over common sense.

49:50.934 --> 49:53.368
He has a sexy
British accent.

49:53.437 --> 49:58.272
He's spontaneous.
He has great fashion sense.
We Iike the same foods and--

49:58.342 --> 50:02.244
Okay, okay, I admit
he does weII on
the checkIist.

50:02.313 --> 50:04.838
Does weII?
He's a nine out
of a ten, Joanne.

50:04.915 --> 50:07.975
That's like unheard of.
And the one thing that
he's missing,

50:08.052 --> 50:10.486
the crazy public fights
and torrid makeup sex,

50:10.554 --> 50:13.250
I'm thinking about
taking that off
the Iist because--

50:13.324 --> 50:17.090
Yeah, Okay. Liam is
a nine out of ten. And l
like seeing you happy,

50:17.161 --> 50:20.961
but he's not a man
in a suit. You have
to find a man in a suit.

50:21.031 --> 50:22.191
Ew.

50:22.266 --> 50:24.496
What, you don't Iike
guys in suits?

50:24.568 --> 50:28.265
No, I ate some
of my mask.

50:28.339 --> 50:31.274
This is Iike junior
high. I feeI Iike
I'm at a sIeepover.

50:31.342 --> 50:32.741
We need snacks.

50:32.810 --> 50:34.209
We need more wine.

50:34.278 --> 50:36.610
M m, Iet's go
to that store
downstairs.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.672
I can't go there,
remember? I had the thing
with the cashier. Remember?

50:39.750 --> 50:43.345
Oh, my God.
Okay, we'II go.

50:43.420 --> 50:45.513
Say hi for me
though. He's hot.

50:47.358 --> 50:49.588
Oh, Lane, l don't
feel so good.

50:49.660 --> 50:51.560
What?

50:51.628 --> 50:54.756
Do I Iook
green to you?

50:54.832 --> 50:57.562
Oh, I forgot
the ice cream
and SprinkIes.

51:00.437 --> 51:02.997
Trying on a new
faII coIor, Ab Fab?

51:03.073 --> 51:05.439
Ab Fab?

51:05.509 --> 51:08.945
Tom? What are
you doing here?

51:09.012 --> 51:11.173
I was just shooting
hoops down the street,

51:11.248 --> 51:14.308
and I heard they were
having a speciaI
on green goo.

51:14.385 --> 51:17.411
Out of the office,
he looks different.

51:17.488 --> 51:18.887
J ust buying
some snacks.

51:18.956 --> 51:20.321
Take a waIk
on the wiId side.

51:20.391 --> 51:22.222
Oh, no no no.
I don't--

51:22.292 --> 51:26.092
l know, l know,
there's no protein
and neurotransmitters.

51:26.163 --> 51:28.097
But this stuff
is utterIy deIicious.

51:28.165 --> 51:31.931
See, it's the deIicious
part that makes me
uncomfortabIe.

51:32.002 --> 51:33.435
Right.

51:33.504 --> 51:36.405
And what army are
you about to poison?

51:36.473 --> 51:39.033
WeII, I just have
a coupIe of--

51:39.109 --> 51:41.737
I actuaIIy have
a Iot of friends over.

51:41.812 --> 51:43.643
WeII, I wiII not
stand in your way.

51:43.714 --> 51:46.842
lt's not a problem.
By the way, today in
the conference room-

51:46.917 --> 51:51.479
Don't worry about it. It took
a bit to get M r. BeImont's
concentration back,

51:51.555 --> 51:54.422
but it was
the highIight
of the meeting.

51:54.491 --> 51:56.322
I-I'II see you
in the morning.

51:56.393 --> 51:58.691
Okay, sounds good.

51:58.762 --> 52:01.595
That's Tom,
your boss?

52:01.665 --> 52:03.860
Yeah, can you
beIieve it?

52:03.934 --> 52:05.526
He's cute.

52:05.602 --> 52:08.196
What are you talking
about? He has a
girlfriend.

52:08.272 --> 52:11.639
A boss Iike that,
now I am green
with envy.

52:11.708 --> 52:14.199
Shut up.

52:30.527 --> 52:32.552
Hey, Lane.
Do I Iook okay?

52:32.629 --> 52:34.620
Yeah sure
big meeting?

52:34.698 --> 52:37.223
Big Iunch with
Margo's parents.

52:37.301 --> 52:39.565
Oh. Pressure.

52:39.636 --> 52:41.228
Yeah.

52:41.305 --> 52:43.034
Come here,
I'II fix your tie.

52:43.106 --> 52:44.971
Oh, thanks.

52:45.042 --> 52:46.805
Is that the
weekIy report?

52:46.877 --> 52:48.174
Yeah, why?

52:48.245 --> 52:50.008
Where'd the new
visuaIs come from?

52:50.080 --> 52:51.809
Oh, I did them.

52:51.882 --> 52:55.249
I thought it wouId be
easier for everyone to
pass the buIIet points.

52:55.319 --> 52:58.152
I'm impressed.

52:58.222 --> 53:01.623
Yeah. Maybe you can heIp
me with the write up on
the Victoria property.

53:01.692 --> 53:03.557
I wouId Iove to.

53:03.627 --> 53:05.822
Now, go charm the pants
of Margo's parents.

53:05.896 --> 53:10.094
Ugh. Not a--not
a pretty picture.

53:10.167 --> 53:11.998
Her dad's super
pear-shaped.

53:14.137 --> 53:16.628
This stuff about
you getting the
job is great.

53:16.707 --> 53:19.301
U m, minor troubIe
at work, that's fine.

53:19.376 --> 53:23.574
U h, but now what we
need is some more depth.

53:23.647 --> 53:28.084
I mean, this can't just be
an articIe about you dating
a bunch of men in suits.

53:28.151 --> 53:31.120
It needs to end with you
finding your magic man.

53:31.188 --> 53:33.588
Which I'm trying
to find. Trust me.

53:33.657 --> 53:37.184
M m, your story needs
a reaI reIationship
to anchor it.

53:37.261 --> 53:39.889
Do you think any of these
guys have that potentiaI?

53:39.963 --> 53:43.023
Well, there's Liam.
Oh, and, uh, Liam.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.761
You stopped
seeing Liam, right?

53:44.835 --> 53:46.393
Oh, yeah.

53:46.470 --> 53:50.236
Then you have pIenty
of time to go on a
dozen more dates.

53:50.307 --> 53:53.640
A dozen?
That's every night.

53:53.710 --> 53:58.670
Yeah, exactIy.
And I expect to read
every singIe detaiI

53:58.749 --> 54:03.482
from every singIe date.
Cover stories are
fuII-time gigs.

54:03.554 --> 54:07.684
For what it's worth,
I stiII think Seth
might be the one.

54:07.758 --> 54:12.252
But I think you shouId
go on a date with him,
you know, one more time.

54:12.329 --> 54:14.661
He might surprise you.

54:14.731 --> 54:16.631
Got it.

54:16.700 --> 54:18.759
l have a new mantra.

54:18.835 --> 54:21.963
''Seth is the one.
Seth, Seth, Seth. ''

54:22.039 --> 54:24.098
l can't see Liam.
l have to see Seth.

54:24.174 --> 54:25.869
Seth, Seth.

54:25.943 --> 54:27.968
Seth !

54:28.045 --> 54:30.513
Hey, any chance you're
free for Iunch tomorrow?

54:30.581 --> 54:32.742
Sure, but I didn't
think that you--

54:32.816 --> 54:34.841
Dude, what
are you doing?

54:34.918 --> 54:36.613
Yeah, sure.

54:36.687 --> 54:38.154
Great.

54:39.923 --> 54:43.359
Oh. This story for Cosmo
is going to ruin my Iife.

54:49.533 --> 54:53.867
So then we had the Ieverage
we needed to compIete the
takeover, which meant more--

54:53.937 --> 54:55.461
Seth might not
be my magic man,

54:55.539 --> 54:57.234
but if l'm not
allowed to see Liam,

54:57.307 --> 55:01.175
at least Seth has
good fashion sense
and a nice butt.

55:01.244 --> 55:05.203
lf he's the trade-off
for a cover story in
Cosmo, l'll take it.

55:05.282 --> 55:08.809
Turns out they had a few
companies in Germany, which
means l had to hire

55:08.885 --> 55:12.981
a translator for a few days
just to help me navigate
through the books.

55:13.056 --> 55:16.992
And after 1 8 months
of approving the financials,
we finally closed the deal.

55:17.060 --> 55:19.290
Now, we're one of
the most powerful--

55:19.363 --> 55:23.823
This isn't working.
My body's here but my spirit
is doing naughty things with--

55:23.900 --> 55:26.232
Liam.

55:28.005 --> 55:29.870
See him.
I said see him.

55:29.940 --> 55:31.703
See him?
See who?

55:31.775 --> 55:34.369
H im. My-sh--
My girIfriend.

55:34.444 --> 55:37.777
She's texting me.
There's this guy and
She shouIdn't see him.

55:37.848 --> 55:39.475
He stood her up
Iike three times.

55:39.549 --> 55:41.176
Do you want
to caII her?

55:41.251 --> 55:44.516
No, it's--

55:44.588 --> 55:47.250
Yeah, I shouId.
Is that okay?

55:47.324 --> 55:48.552
No, of course.

55:48.625 --> 55:50.616
I'm sorry.
She needs me.

55:50.694 --> 55:52.594
We can get together
later in the week.

55:52.663 --> 55:54.597
ReaIIy?

55:54.665 --> 55:56.656
Okay. Thank you.

56:05.342 --> 56:09.438
New plan for my article.
l'll date Liam, write
about him,

56:09.513 --> 56:12.812
but instead
of using Liam's name,
l'll say it's Seth.

56:12.883 --> 56:15.443
Now, that is
creative writing.

56:17.187 --> 56:19.712
I have a surprise for you.

56:19.790 --> 56:23.123
Thai chicken wrap.
HeaIthy and deIicious.

56:23.193 --> 56:26.458
You can try something
new every once
in a whiIe.

56:26.530 --> 56:28.691
I had them put extra
neurotransmitters

56:28.765 --> 56:31.734
and a dash
of omega acid.
J ust try it.

56:31.802 --> 56:33.030
Fine.

56:37.574 --> 56:38.768
Wow.

56:38.842 --> 56:40.571
Yeah, deIish, huh?

56:40.644 --> 56:43.613
That is the best
neurotransmitters
I've ever had.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.774
I'm gIad.
What's this for?

56:46.850 --> 56:48.909
It's for the presentation
next week. What do you think?

56:48.985 --> 56:49.815
It's O K.

56:49.886 --> 56:51.251
You don't Iike it?

56:51.321 --> 56:52.982
It's not that
I don't Iike it.

56:53.056 --> 56:54.921
It's awfuI.

56:54.991 --> 56:59.951
It's awfuI. If you're
gonna make visuaIs, Tom,
you shouId make them visuaI.

57:00.030 --> 57:03.431
You couId use
coIor and composition
to enhance your pitch.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.560
You wanna
surprise them.
Entice them, you know,

57:06.636 --> 57:08.604
make them want
just a IittIe bit more.

57:12.209 --> 57:13.267
Wait, what are you--

57:13.343 --> 57:15.140
It's aII right.
It's aII good.

57:16.480 --> 57:18.345
If it makes you
feeI any better,

57:18.415 --> 57:20.474
I Iike the shirt
you wore into
work today.

57:20.550 --> 57:22.415
It's the same shirt
I wore yesterday.

57:22.486 --> 57:24.351
ReaIIy? The same?

57:24.421 --> 57:28.448
WeII, not the exact
same. Its brother.

57:28.525 --> 57:30.356
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

57:30.427 --> 57:33.828
You know, maybe I wiII
take you up on that Lane
DanieIs makeover someday.

57:33.897 --> 57:35.728
Anytime.

57:35.799 --> 57:37.926
Eat your
transmitters.

57:47.110 --> 57:51.479
Dating Liam. Oh,
Seth, is wonderful.

57:51.548 --> 57:54.813
He's charming,
he's romantic,
he's sexy.

57:57.020 --> 57:59.011
We're in our own
little love cocoon.

57:59.089 --> 58:00.954
Hey.

58:01.024 --> 58:02.548
Hey.

58:02.626 --> 58:04.116
How's your friend?

58:04.194 --> 58:07.095
She's great.
Thank you for asking.

58:08.532 --> 58:09.726
CooI.

58:14.171 --> 58:16.765
Even if we're just
passing each other
in the office,

58:16.840 --> 58:19.638
we have crazy
sexual tension.

58:35.525 --> 58:38.289
Okay, l probably
shouldn't tell you this,

58:38.361 --> 58:42.388
but ever since college
l've had this thing.

58:42.465 --> 58:45.400
It's a Iist
for eIigibIe guys.

58:45.468 --> 58:49.097
It's basicaIIy a
checkIist to find
my magic man.

58:49.172 --> 58:51.299
Your what?

58:51.374 --> 58:53.842
My magic man.
I know.

58:53.910 --> 58:57.778
What, Iike card tricks? Rabbit
out of a hat? Is that what
we're taIking about?

58:57.848 --> 59:01.909
I know it sounds siIIy.
But, okay, I just wanted
you to know

59:01.985 --> 59:06.422
that you've scored
highest on the Iist.
I mean, aImost perfect.

59:06.489 --> 59:08.957
Wait. ''AImost perfect''?

59:09.025 --> 59:10.322
M m-hm.

59:10.393 --> 59:12.384
Give me a chance, Lane.
What am I missing?

59:16.466 --> 59:19.060
How couId you possibIy
have seduced my
twin brother

59:19.135 --> 59:22.036
when you knew
it wouId rip my
souI from my body,

59:22.105 --> 59:24.699
Ieaving a gaping hoIe
that wiII aIways bear
your name?

59:24.774 --> 59:28.335
You know what? I onIy sIept
with him once. And it was just
to make you jeaIous!

59:28.411 --> 59:31.073
Besides, you Ied me on
to beIieve you were
freaking dead !

59:31.147 --> 59:33.809
I was in a coma!
But I'm awake now, Lane.

59:33.884 --> 59:35.943
Is there anything
I can do to win you back?

59:36.019 --> 59:39.386
Yes. You know what?
Lose my freaking number!

59:44.194 --> 59:45.593
J ust met her tonight.

59:48.632 --> 59:50.998
Dreadful sorry
about the big
fight last night.

59:51.067 --> 59:53.729
Oh, not me.
The makeup was
worth it.

59:53.803 --> 59:57.466
Wait a moment.
Does this make me
ten out of ten?

59:57.540 --> 01:00:01.442
U m, after Iast night,
I think that that
makes you

01:00:01.511 --> 01:00:03.945
eIeven out of a ten.

01:00:06.116 --> 01:00:08.209
Looking forward
to our next fight.

01:00:08.285 --> 01:00:10.116
M m, me, too.

01:00:15.992 --> 01:00:17.926
' EIIo.

01:00:17.994 --> 01:00:21.760
Sorry, I didn't know
I was supposed to
cook for three.

01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.095
Oh, that Iooks deIicious.

01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:26.727
Because of fake
Seth, I'm famished.

01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:30.534
Yeah, nothing like
deceiving Cosmo to
work up an appetite.

01:00:30.607 --> 01:00:35.840
Everything is true,
except for the fact
that it's fiction.

01:00:35.912 --> 01:00:38.380
Kate just said
that she wanted
a good story, okay?

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:42.043
And trust me,
this is gonna
be a good story.

01:00:42.118 --> 01:00:45.713
Yeah, I know.
I think I heard
the cIimax Iast night.

01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:50.826
I just don't want you
to get in troubIe.

01:00:50.894 --> 01:00:54.455
I hear you,
but it's fine.

01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:56.795
It's fine.

01:00:56.866 --> 01:01:00.666
Yeah. WeII, now that you're
exaggerating characters
and making things up,

01:01:00.737 --> 01:01:06.642
I want you to name
me. . . Lucy. I'm your
best friend.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:09.770
I'm the other hot girI
at Thompson FuIworth,

01:01:09.846 --> 01:01:14.806
and I'm using C osmo's
''ten most exciting pIaces
to have sex in the workpIace''

01:01:14.884 --> 01:01:16.715
as my extracurricuIar guide.

01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:20.449
You know, with an imagination
Iike that, I think you
shouId be the writer.

01:01:20.523 --> 01:01:24.254
I'm thinking about it.
Okay, friends share, so
you don't get this anymore.

01:01:24.327 --> 01:01:27.728
No, no, you were bad.
You did a bad thing.

01:01:29.899 --> 01:01:33.699
As l'm sure you all know,
our internal review with
M r. Belmont is on the 2 7 th,

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:37.035
and we need to prove
our department's vaIue
moving forward.

01:01:37.107 --> 01:01:40.167
The presentation needs
to be visuaI and we're
gonna mix it up.

01:01:40.243 --> 01:01:43.076
We need to surprise
him, entice him.

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:46.912
We're gonna run
everything through
one person.

01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:47.642
Lane?

01:01:47.717 --> 01:01:49.685
Yeah.

01:01:49.753 --> 01:01:52.051
You'II handIe
the visuaIs.

01:01:52.122 --> 01:01:55.683
Lane has a really great eye
for this stuff and l have
complete confidence in her.

01:01:55.759 --> 01:01:59.320
All right,
gentlemen, that's it.
Thank you very much

01:02:06.503 --> 01:02:09.028
Jackie has a thing

01:02:09.105 --> 01:02:10.800
l n addition to
the presentation,

01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:12.341
l'm writing
my Cosmo story,

01:02:12.409 --> 01:02:15.503
starring fake Seth,
the sexiest guy ever.

01:02:15.578 --> 01:02:17.739
Who happens to look
a lot like Liam.

01:02:17.814 --> 01:02:21.011
And she can
Make it swing

01:02:23.353 --> 01:02:26.186
That's reaIIy good.
They're reaIIy yummy.

01:02:26.256 --> 01:02:29.623
Even if she's
Trying to forget

01:02:29.692 --> 01:02:34.254
Between the stage lights
And the threat

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.798
Hey-hey-hey-hey! Look.

01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:43.699
l'm working long hours
but l'm part of a team,
and that feels great.

01:02:43.773 --> 01:02:48.574
The lonely night
Of sad rain

01:02:48.645 --> 01:02:51.205
Like a lone
Lost child

01:02:51.281 --> 01:02:55.513
Who's on
His own again

01:02:55.585 --> 01:02:56.711
Lane.

01:02:56.786 --> 01:02:57.844
Yeah?

01:02:57.921 --> 01:03:00.082
RecycIed paper.
That's great.

01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:02.351
Oh, I thought
you'd Iike that.

01:03:02.425 --> 01:03:05.360
So, why don't we use
recycled paper
around here?

01:03:05.428 --> 01:03:08.761
Oh, you know, it's a good
question. The short answer
is it's out of my controI.

01:03:08.832 --> 01:03:10.925
Why don't you make it
in your controI?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.527
lt's good for the planet,
and l bet you could save
this place a lot of money.

01:03:14.604 --> 01:03:17.596
We couId save
a Iot of money,
but onIy over time.

01:03:17.674 --> 01:03:22.304
U h, hey, this is gonna sound
siIIy, but I wanted a new
suit for the presentation.

01:03:22.378 --> 01:03:25.711
I was wondering if
I couId take you up on that
makeover we taIked about.

01:03:25.782 --> 01:03:27.374
WouId Whitney
be okay with that?

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:29.179
Whitney? We broke up.

01:03:29.252 --> 01:03:31.447
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:31.521 --> 01:03:35.218
Oh, no-no-no,
don't be. It wasn't
meant to be. She was--

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:36.451
A little demanding?

01:03:36.526 --> 01:03:37.823
Yeah.

01:03:37.894 --> 01:03:39.555
And she wore
fake naiIs.

01:03:39.629 --> 01:03:42.189
WeII, there
was that, too.

01:03:42.265 --> 01:03:44.859
You shouId've toId me.
We couId've gotten drunk

01:03:44.934 --> 01:03:48.199
and had cupcakes
and thrown eggs
at her apartment.

01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:51.206
We stiII can
if you want.

01:03:51.274 --> 01:03:54.675
No, no, no, that--
That's okay.
But thanks.

01:03:54.744 --> 01:03:58.646
WeII, Iet's get you a new
suit. There's nothing Iike
shopping to cheer you up.

01:03:58.715 --> 01:04:00.080
Let's do it.

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:02.050
You

01:04:02.118 --> 01:04:05.019
Give me exactly

01:04:06.089 --> 01:04:08.353
What l need

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.386
Return the caII?

01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:13.019
Spin around.

01:04:13.096 --> 01:04:15.064
Oh, yeah.

01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:17.156
Now do a IittIe dance.

01:04:17.233 --> 01:04:18.700
Oh, my goodness.

01:04:18.768 --> 01:04:20.998
So, do you Iike it?

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.833
I do.

01:04:22.906 --> 01:04:24.203
H uh?

01:04:35.852 --> 01:04:37.114
Oh.

01:04:39.923 --> 01:04:41.857
Yeah !

01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:51.964
I Iike.
I Iike it.
Are we done?

01:04:52.035 --> 01:04:54.595
M m. AImost.

01:04:54.671 --> 01:04:56.468
Come on.

01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:02.009
You think
this is better?

01:05:02.078 --> 01:05:05.172
Yes. I wiII miss
your brother and
sister shirts,

01:05:05.248 --> 01:05:06.909
but I think you
Iook reaIIy nice.

01:05:06.983 --> 01:05:08.644
I guess I shouId
thank you then.

01:05:11.854 --> 01:05:14.755
U m, I'd better
get back.

01:05:14.824 --> 01:05:18.851
Yup. I'm gonna run to the
printer's, grab the mock-ups
and I'II see you in an hour.

01:05:18.928 --> 01:05:23.331
Okay, yeah.
I'm just gonna change
and then I'II--Okay.

01:05:52.929 --> 01:05:55.193
Ta-dah !

01:05:55.265 --> 01:05:57.825
What do you think?
Great, right?

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.891
They're fine, Lane.

01:05:59.969 --> 01:06:02.028
U h-oh, somebody's
in a mood.

01:06:03.439 --> 01:06:04.997
My article.

01:06:05.074 --> 01:06:06.769
Where did you get those?

01:06:06.843 --> 01:06:09.505
It was sitting on top of
the printer. The foIder
was on your desk.

01:06:09.579 --> 01:06:11.137
Tom, this isn't
what you think.

01:06:11.214 --> 01:06:13.682
AII this time,
after everything--

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.342
You smug
IittIe bastard.

01:06:15.418 --> 01:06:17.283
I think I'm
missing something.

01:06:17.353 --> 01:06:20.686
You don't understand.
Tom, the article wasn't
what you think.

01:06:20.757 --> 01:06:23.191
Wait a minute. This is
for a stupid articIe?

01:06:23.259 --> 01:06:27.286
It's not a stupid articIe.
It's a cover story for
Cosmo magazine.

01:06:27.363 --> 01:06:29.490
l'll just be
in my office.

01:06:29.565 --> 01:06:31.499
You're staying
right here.

01:06:31.567 --> 01:06:32.898
It wasn't Seth.

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:34.527
What wasn't me?

01:06:34.604 --> 01:06:36.231
It was a fake Seth.
I made it up.

01:06:36.306 --> 01:06:39.104
Yeah, the sexuaI
tension between you
guys, the chocoIate sex.

01:06:39.175 --> 01:06:40.642
We had chocoIate sex?

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.337
Get out.

01:06:42.412 --> 01:06:44.846
I thought
I knew you, Lane.

01:06:44.914 --> 01:06:48.350
And not to sound too
personaI, but I reaIIy
enjoyed working with you.

01:06:48.418 --> 01:06:50.215
And now l find out
everything is a lie.

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:51.981
Don't say that.
That's not true.

01:06:52.055 --> 01:06:55.388
Then what the heII is
true, Lane? I hired you.
I beIieved in you.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:56.982
And I worked
reaIIy hard.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.291
No, you worked hard
on your story, on
tricking everyone.

01:07:00.363 --> 01:07:02.957
l thought that
you were becoming
a great assistant.

01:07:03.032 --> 01:07:06.229
But I didn't know you
were hooking up with
every guy in the office.

01:07:06.302 --> 01:07:09.499
I didn't hook up with
anyone. And I did become
a great assistant.

01:07:09.572 --> 01:07:11.665
Okay, I Iearned
your hand signaIs,

01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:14.938
l studied those tutorials,
and l worked late
every night

01:07:15.011 --> 01:07:17.172
and I poured my heart
into these visuaIs.

01:07:22.385 --> 01:07:24.376
Goodbye, Tom.

01:07:34.297 --> 01:07:37.323
I just had the most
horribIe day ever.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.027
Oh, are you
okay, love?

01:07:39.102 --> 01:07:43.436
No. I just got
fired from my job
and ruined everything.

01:07:43.506 --> 01:07:47.943
I want you to just
come over and hoId me
and hand me tissues.

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:49.705
l'd love to, Lane,
l really would,

01:07:49.779 --> 01:07:51.940
but l'm actually
out of town.

01:07:52.014 --> 01:07:53.948
You are?

01:07:54.016 --> 01:07:57.281
l had to hop over to
London. One of my acts
had a little meltdown.

01:07:57.353 --> 01:07:58.752
l'll be back Friday.
We could pick up
some cheesecake,

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.153
Enjoy it in
your bedroom.

01:08:02.225 --> 01:08:04.489
Okay. WeII,
I miss you.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.858
l miss you,
too. Bye.

01:08:09.198 --> 01:08:12.656
This is where Liam
and l had our very
first date.

01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:15.568
Do you know what's
wrong with dating
a British guy?

01:08:15.638 --> 01:08:18.835
When you really need
him, he's in England.

01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:22.104
Joanne, what
am I gonna do?

01:08:22.178 --> 01:08:24.372
I got fired
from my job,

01:08:24.447 --> 01:08:27.575
I Iet tom down, and
now my articIe is dead.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:29.618
No, it's not.

01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:33.314
Aren't you forgetting
about your best friend who
vouched for you at Cosmo?

01:08:33.389 --> 01:08:36.085
You can't just decIare
your articIe dead.

01:08:36.158 --> 01:08:40.618
I know that
you vouched for me,
and I feeI horribIe.

01:08:40.696 --> 01:08:45.359
But my story was supposed
to be about finding Iove
in the worId of business,

01:08:45.435 --> 01:08:48.198
and the worId of business
has kicked me out.
So now what?

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:51.171
Lane, I toId you
not to date Liam.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.332
I toId you not
to write Iies.

01:08:53.408 --> 01:08:56.310
I know you did.
I screwed up.

01:08:59.948 --> 01:09:01.473
Lane.

01:09:02.952 --> 01:09:05.613
Lane.

01:09:05.688 --> 01:09:07.553
I think
I just saw Liam.

01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:09.022
He's in London.

01:09:13.328 --> 01:09:16.196
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:19.359
A pleasure to see you as
always. And the lovely lady.

01:09:19.435 --> 01:09:21.665
You had time to make
it out whiIe you're here.

01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:23.363
Oh, it's so nice
to visit New York.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.236
I've been so cooped
up in the studio.

01:09:25.308 --> 01:09:29.108
He's a producer,
you know.

01:09:29.178 --> 01:09:33.011
Okay, okay, so you're
a record producer as weII?

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:35.209
It's fascinating.

01:09:35.283 --> 01:09:36.615
Yes, it is.

01:09:36.685 --> 01:09:38.586
LoveIy to see you, Lane.

01:09:38.654 --> 01:09:40.917
HeIIo, Liam.
How was London?

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:44.357
It was rather--
Let's taIk outside.

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:48.988
J ust one second, Iove.
Let me teII you how
this works.

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:54.229
This, uh, waiter has
a great British accent,

01:09:54.303 --> 01:09:57.670
and he's gonna
teII you aII of these
fantastic stories

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.334
about his exciting
Iife in EngIand.

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:03.810
And he's smooth,
so you're gonna
fall for it.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.214
And it's gonna
turn out to be
one big cheap Iie.

01:10:08.284 --> 01:10:09.808
I just wanted
to impress you.

01:10:09.886 --> 01:10:12.218
You just wanted
to get Iaid.

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:15.416
ShaII we?

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:18.585
Oh. Yes.

01:10:18.661 --> 01:10:21.630
I definiteIy
think we shaII.

01:10:25.668 --> 01:10:28.933
That was good.
WeII-pIayed.

01:10:35.845 --> 01:10:37.244
Jerk.

01:10:40.783 --> 01:10:43.183
l know l deserve this.

01:10:43.252 --> 01:10:45.846
l lied to everyone
at work and Liam
lied to me.

01:10:45.922 --> 01:10:47.822
lt's karma, and
it strikes quickly.

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:50.358
And because everything has
to fall apart at once,

01:10:50.426 --> 01:10:53.156
l can't get my story
about fake Seth to work.

01:10:59.068 --> 01:11:00.160
Tom?

01:11:00.236 --> 01:11:01.828
Lane, where are you?

01:11:01.904 --> 01:11:03.337
What do you mean?

01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:05.397
Did you forget we have
a presentation today?

01:11:05.474 --> 01:11:07.704
Did you forget
that you fired me?

01:11:07.777 --> 01:11:09.039
I didn't fire you.

01:11:09.111 --> 01:11:11.341
That's what it
sounded Iike to me.

01:11:11.414 --> 01:11:14.941
I was upset with you.
The presentation is in two
hours and I need those visuaIs.

01:11:15.017 --> 01:11:17.781
Two hours? I have to
get to the printer's
to pick them up.

01:11:17.853 --> 01:11:19.684
WeII, then run
to the printer's.

01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:22.019
Everyone is mad at me.
I Iied to everyone.

01:11:22.091 --> 01:11:23.888
Lane, this isn't
the seventh grade.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.724
It's investment banking.
Now, get me those boards.

01:11:28.331 --> 01:11:29.923
What's up?

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.459
Tom needs me
to come back
to work.

01:11:33.536 --> 01:11:35.265
Wearing that?

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.601
No.

01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:48.606
Thank you for
coming today,
M r. BeImont.

01:11:48.684 --> 01:11:50.709
Let's begin with--

01:11:50.786 --> 01:11:52.777
Oh.

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:54.880
Sorry.

01:11:56.659 --> 01:11:57.853
M r. BeImont, hi.

01:11:59.528 --> 01:12:01.894
Lots of traffic.

01:12:01.964 --> 01:12:06.526
M r. BeImont, Lane
here is going to provide
us with some visuaIs

01:12:06.602 --> 01:12:09.400
that I think wiII
reaIIy enhance
the presentation.

01:12:09.472 --> 01:12:12.771
Let's begin. This year's
numbers for corporate
strategic pIanning

01:12:12.842 --> 01:12:17.040
were depressed by a few
factors but, given the overaII
cIimate in emerging markets,

01:12:17.113 --> 01:12:20.014
we feeI confident
that we wiII see an
increase in profits.

01:12:20.082 --> 01:12:23.882
All you have to do is take
a look at the l ndian market.
Prepared to skyrocket.

01:12:23.953 --> 01:12:27.354
lf we can consolidate
these gains, we'll
move forward.

01:12:27.423 --> 01:12:29.721
This is gonna be
a great year,

01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:32.226
and we hope
you'II agree.

01:12:35.498 --> 01:12:37.625
WeII, Tom, you
and your department

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.396
certainIy put together
an impressive presentation,

01:12:40.469 --> 01:12:44.200
and I must say
the visuaIs were
quite impressive.

01:12:44.273 --> 01:12:48.903
U nfortunately,
the economic realities
of this are not pretty.

01:12:48.978 --> 01:12:51.538
We have to cut
$34 miIIion this month,

01:12:51.614 --> 01:12:55.175
and I'II have to puII
key pIayers from your
group into M&A.

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:56.775
What happens
to everybody eIse?

01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:59.787
We'II Iet you know
who's making the
transition shortIy.

01:12:59.855 --> 01:13:03.484
And the rest of you,
wiII work through the
beginning of the month.

01:13:09.065 --> 01:13:11.966
Yeah. Thank you.
We're finished here.

01:13:15.738 --> 01:13:17.535
Tom.

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:20.469
- Wait, M r. Belmont.
- Lane, no.

01:13:20.543 --> 01:13:23.205
M r. BeImont,
I think you're
missing the point.

01:13:23.279 --> 01:13:24.769
And what point is
that, young Iady?

01:13:24.847 --> 01:13:27.281
If you couId save
even more money than
the $34 miIIion

01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:29.317
you're Iooking
to cut from the budget,

01:13:29.385 --> 01:13:32.980
and simuItaneousIy improve
your image in the business
and consumer markets,

01:13:33.055 --> 01:13:35.649
you'd be interested
in that, wouIdn't you?

01:13:35.725 --> 01:13:39.354
Is this a riddIe? I
have another meeting
in five minutes.

01:13:39.428 --> 01:13:40.918
Okay. J ust--

01:13:42.631 --> 01:13:46.328
Didn't you say that
you couId do aII of
this by going green?

01:13:46.402 --> 01:13:48.461
You toId me you couId
save this company money.

01:13:48.537 --> 01:13:50.505
I said it was
out of my controI.

01:13:50.573 --> 01:13:54.134
This isn't
seventh grade,
Tom. Take controI.

01:13:56.746 --> 01:13:58.270
Go.

01:14:04.453 --> 01:14:06.683
M r. BeImont--

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:11.025
Go.

01:14:11.093 --> 01:14:13.687
I wanna propose
a green initiative.

01:14:13.763 --> 01:14:16.664
Our bank can reduce
our environmentaI impact,

01:14:16.732 --> 01:14:19.963
support eco-friendIy
traders and save
miIIions of doIIars.

01:14:20.035 --> 01:14:23.994
Tom, I wouIdn't mind saving
the pIanet, but we have some
hard decisions to make

01:14:24.073 --> 01:14:25.904
and a few
cosmetic changes.

01:14:25.975 --> 01:14:29.206
It wouId take more than
a few cosmetic changes.
We have to target heating,

01:14:29.278 --> 01:14:31.940
cooIing, waste and
transportation. I can
show you the math.

01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:34.539
What makes you think
your group shouId Iead
this initiative?

01:14:34.617 --> 01:14:37.848
Corporate strategic pIanning
is the onIy division in
the entire company

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.013
that deaIs with
every other department,

01:14:40.089 --> 01:14:43.388
and we handIe
properties for our
cIients and our bank.

01:14:48.264 --> 01:14:50.232
AII right. Fine.

01:14:50.299 --> 01:14:52.494
l'm listening,
but l wanna
see the math

01:14:52.568 --> 01:14:55.036
and l wanna see
a ten-year projection.

01:14:55.104 --> 01:14:59.006
And if you can back
this up, I'II keep
your department together.

01:14:59.074 --> 01:15:00.837
You won't be
disappointed, sir.

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.071
All right, Thomas.
l mpress me.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.018
That was so great.

01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:16.182
You saved
our department.

01:15:16.258 --> 01:15:17.691
N ice work, Tom.

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:25.828
Seth, I'm sorry
about mixing you up
with my articIe.

01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:29.393
It was nothing personaI.
You were so nice to me
and I shouId have--

01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:31.735
Lane, it's aII right.

01:15:31.807 --> 01:15:33.536
ReaIIy?

01:15:33.609 --> 01:15:38.069
Yeah. Besides, I couId never
do what you described
in your articIe.

01:15:39.315 --> 01:15:41.180
I'm aIIergic
to chocoIate.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.684
Right.

01:15:48.557 --> 01:15:50.115
Oh.

01:15:58.534 --> 01:16:00.434
Amazing work today.

01:16:00.502 --> 01:16:02.527
You, too.

01:16:02.605 --> 01:16:05.130
Good Iuck on the articIe.
I'II be Iooking for it.

01:16:05.207 --> 01:16:08.233
Yeah, weII,
don't beIieve
everything you read.

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:10.710
What? So, you're
not gonna write
the true story?

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:13.942
Cosmo doesn't want
the true story.

01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:16.211
They want the story
that I pitched.

01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:20.483
And I've been wanting to
work there for as Iong
as I can remember.

01:16:20.556 --> 01:16:23.047
H m. Yeah.
WeII, I get that,

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:26.788
but I think you owe it
to yourseIf to write
what actuaIIy happened.

01:16:26.862 --> 01:16:29.194
It couId be
a great story.

01:16:29.265 --> 01:16:32.063
Thanks, Tom. I didn't
deserve to work

01:16:32.134 --> 01:16:35.729
for a guy Iike you.
And I'm sorry.

01:16:35.804 --> 01:16:38.705
It's okay.
Working in
investment banking,

01:16:38.774 --> 01:16:40.435
I don't meet many
women Iike you.

01:16:42.378 --> 01:16:45.506
It was, um,
an adventure.

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:49.007
A great adventure.

01:16:51.687 --> 01:16:52.949
Goodbye, Tom.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.148
Good, huh?

01:17:20.215 --> 01:17:23.150
What really happened
may not have a
happy ending,

01:17:23.218 --> 01:17:25.778
but love just doesn't
happen to girls like me.

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:30.052
Girls who built their
hopes on an intricate
web of daydreams.

01:17:33.195 --> 01:17:36.255
The truth is that
everyone has issues,

01:17:36.332 --> 01:17:39.460
and maybe building up
a fake perfect man
in my mind

01:17:39.535 --> 01:17:41.901
is my biggest
issue of all.

01:17:41.971 --> 01:17:45.236
l've been walking
around with the ghost
of my magic man.

01:17:45.307 --> 01:17:49.209
He's been haunting me,
keeping me from recognizing
a world of opportunities

01:17:49.278 --> 01:17:50.973
that were right
in front of me.

01:17:51.046 --> 01:17:53.674
My anger at Liam
eventually faded away.

01:17:53.749 --> 01:17:56.718
After all, he was just
giving me what l wanted.

01:17:56.785 --> 01:17:58.878
Every lovesick
girl's fantasy.

01:17:58.954 --> 01:18:02.549
An idealized version
of what l imagined love
should look like.

01:18:03.993 --> 01:18:06.154
But there's no such
thing as perfection.

01:18:06.228 --> 01:18:08.526
Love is for people
who are realistic

01:18:08.597 --> 01:18:11.225
and smart enough to open
their hearts and minds,

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.825
and who realize that
a real relationship

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:17.133
is the ultimate fantasy.

01:18:17.206 --> 01:18:19.265
l haven't found
that relationship, yet,

01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:24.278
but l've shaken off the
shadow of my magic man
and l'm finding myself.

01:18:24.346 --> 01:18:26.280
l think that's
a pretty good start.

01:18:26.348 --> 01:18:29.374
I'd say you
toId the truth.

01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:31.681
Yup, nothing
but the truth.

01:18:31.754 --> 01:18:35.246
I just couIdn't teII
a Iie, you know, after
everything I Iearned.

01:18:35.324 --> 01:18:38.623
WeII, it's probabIy
the Iast articIe you'II
be writing for Cosmo.

01:18:38.694 --> 01:18:42.095
And I don't imagine
they'II be caIIing me
anytime soon.

01:18:42.164 --> 01:18:45.531
I'm sorry, Joanne.
You stuck your neck
out for me and I--

01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:50.265
Okay, enough.
You did the right
thing. I'm proud of you.

01:18:53.575 --> 01:18:55.406
It's Kate.

01:18:55.477 --> 01:18:57.138
Kate from Cosmo?

01:18:57.212 --> 01:18:59.043
HeIIo.

01:18:59.114 --> 01:19:03.574
Lane, hi. U h, I need
to see you in my office
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:19:03.652 --> 01:19:08.316
U m, sure. So, what
did you think bout the
articIe? I know that it's--

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.585
I'II see you here.

01:19:16.331 --> 01:19:18.925
So, what does one
wear to get fired in?

01:19:19.001 --> 01:19:21.299
Oh. Hang on.
Here, take mine.

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:22.632
I need it.

01:19:30.312 --> 01:19:33.304
Why did l tell the truth?
What was l thinking?

01:19:33.382 --> 01:19:39.218
l should've just written
the article Kate asked for.
She's gonna be so pissed.

01:19:39.288 --> 01:19:41.848
So, this is what
hell looks like.

01:19:43.525 --> 01:19:46.494
Oh, l hate this crosswalk.
lt's taking me to my doom,

01:19:46.562 --> 01:19:49.224
my destruction,
the crushing of
my dream.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.159
Thank you for coming
in today, Lane.

01:19:53.235 --> 01:19:55.260
Kate.

01:19:56.472 --> 01:19:58.133
I'm sorry
about the articIe.

01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:03.270
I don't--I know
that it's terribIe
and I'm gonna redo it.

01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:05.609
I got sick and I feII
and I hit my head and--

01:20:05.681 --> 01:20:07.114
Lane, it's perfect.

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.843
I don't know what
got into me and--

01:20:11.153 --> 01:20:12.211
What?

01:20:12.287 --> 01:20:15.051
It's everything
I ever wanted.

01:20:15.124 --> 01:20:17.524
Everyone at
Cosmo Ioves it.

01:20:27.369 --> 01:20:32.068
When you came into
my office asking to change
what the story was about,

01:20:32.141 --> 01:20:35.042
I reaIized this was
about something
much deeper.

01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:38.739
I reaIized this
was about you figuring
things out for yourseIf.

01:20:40.549 --> 01:20:42.813
I want to
congratuIate you

01:20:42.885 --> 01:20:46.616
on your outstanding
cover story for Cosmo.

01:20:46.688 --> 01:20:49.088
Thank you.

01:20:49.158 --> 01:20:52.650
And of course I'm
gonna want updates
on you and Tom.

01:20:52.728 --> 01:20:54.389
Tom?

01:20:54.463 --> 01:20:57.591
It's so obvious you guys
are into each other.

01:20:57.666 --> 01:20:59.327
What? Me and Tom?

01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:01.232
Wait a second.
So, you just went in

01:21:01.303 --> 01:21:04.295
and kicked ass
on the big presentation,
packed up your desk,

01:21:04.373 --> 01:21:06.898
said goodbye
and just waIked out?

01:21:06.975 --> 01:21:09.034
Yes. That's
what happened.

01:21:09.111 --> 01:21:11.409
You never mentioned
how he scored on
your checkIist.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.345
Because I didn't do
a checkIist for Tom.

01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:17.010
Oh, my God.
Okay, hoId on.
What was it?

01:21:19.188 --> 01:21:21.748
Okay. Does he take
trips to exotic pIaces
on a whim?

01:21:21.823 --> 01:21:23.051
Where are you going?

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.025
Back to my office.

01:21:25.093 --> 01:21:27.084
Does he put passion
above common sense?

01:21:27.162 --> 01:21:30.393
ActuaIIy, I bought six.
The same but not
the same same.

01:21:30.465 --> 01:21:33.263
Not reaIIy and no.

01:21:33.335 --> 01:21:36.600
Do you have
crazy pubIic fights
and torrid makeup sex?

01:21:36.672 --> 01:21:38.230
This is for a
stupid articIe?

01:21:38.307 --> 01:21:40.104
We actuaIIy did have
a pubIic fight,

01:21:40.175 --> 01:21:44.544
but it wasn't crazy and
there was definiteIy
no makeup sex.

01:21:44.613 --> 01:21:46.410
Does he share
your taste in food?

01:21:46.481 --> 01:21:48.278
Why don't you take
a waIk on the wiId side?

01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:50.250
No.

01:21:50.319 --> 01:21:53.982
Does he have an accent?
Does he pIay a sexy
musicaI instrument?

01:21:54.056 --> 01:21:57.048
Yes. No.

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:59.491
Well, he plays
the harmonica.

01:21:59.561 --> 01:22:01.961
Are you starting
to see a pattern here?

01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:05.227
That Tom is a
zero out of a ten?

01:22:07.269 --> 01:22:08.759
And?

01:22:09.838 --> 01:22:11.328
And--

01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:15.907
I think I have to go.

01:22:20.048 --> 01:22:22.243
That's my girI.

01:22:24.553 --> 01:22:29.047
All that time my true magic
man was was right in front of
me and l didn't even notice.

01:22:29.124 --> 01:22:32.389
l have to find Tom.

01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:34.053
Lane.

01:22:34.129 --> 01:22:35.687
Hey, where's Tom?

01:22:35.764 --> 01:22:38.631
U m, sorry I was spinning
in your chair, but it
spins good.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.065
John.

01:22:40.135 --> 01:22:42.365
U h, I don't know.
Are you okay?

01:22:42.437 --> 01:22:45.270
Oh, we'II see.
I need to find him.
Do you know where he is?

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.467
Maybe he's
down the haII.

01:22:47.542 --> 01:22:49.476
It spins better if
you go the other way.

01:22:52.347 --> 01:22:53.871
Oh. She's right.

01:22:54.983 --> 01:22:57.975
Ooh ! Seth.
Hey. How are you?

01:22:58.053 --> 01:23:01.352
I'm--I'm good.
I-I started seeing
my ex-girIfriend again.

01:23:01.423 --> 01:23:04.017
l used to think
she was crazy, but
after dating you--

01:23:05.994 --> 01:23:09.953
U m, I'm gIad I couId heIp.
Look, I need to find Tom.
Do you know where he is?

01:23:10.032 --> 01:23:13.695
He's actuaIIy
in the conference room,
but he's in a meeting.

01:23:13.769 --> 01:23:15.532
N ice seeing you, Lane.

01:23:15.604 --> 01:23:17.868
Yeah.

01:23:17.939 --> 01:23:20.169
AII right, guys.
The entire department--

01:23:20.242 --> 01:23:22.039
Tom.

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:24.476
Ab Fab, what are
you doing here?

01:23:24.546 --> 01:23:26.343
I figured it out.

01:23:26.415 --> 01:23:27.746
Figured what out?

01:23:27.816 --> 01:23:30.250
You have no styIe,
you Iike boring food

01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:33.447
and you have way
too much common sense.

01:23:33.522 --> 01:23:35.683
U m, okay.

01:23:35.757 --> 01:23:38.419
You're not spontaneous,
you don't have a
sexy accent

01:23:38.493 --> 01:23:41.053
and you are nothing
I want in a guy.

01:23:41.129 --> 01:23:42.926
Thanks?

01:23:42.998 --> 01:23:46.331
No, it's a good thing
and it just took me a
whiIe to reaIize that.

01:23:46.401 --> 01:23:48.835
I don't think
I foIIow.

01:23:48.904 --> 01:23:52.738
Tom, I--I'm in
Iove with you.

01:23:56.044 --> 01:23:57.671
I Iove you, too.

01:24:07.422 --> 01:24:11.654
You know how you want your
first kiss to be strikingly
passionate and beautiful

01:24:11.727 --> 01:24:14.423
with everyone rising
for a standing ovation?

01:24:14.496 --> 01:24:17.488
WeII, it turned out
to be exactIy what
I hoped for.

01:24:19.368 --> 01:24:20.392
Ow!

01:24:20.469 --> 01:24:22.164
I'm sorry.

01:24:22.237 --> 01:24:24.398
Well, almost.

01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:29.308
Ah, the articIes.
They're fantastic.

01:24:29.378 --> 01:24:31.107
I toId you
you shouId've
used my Iist.

01:24:31.179 --> 01:24:33.875
Tom is cute
and he breathes.

01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:36.110
So, now that you're
a big-time writer,

01:24:36.184 --> 01:24:38.482
are you gonna pitch
in for groceries?

01:24:38.553 --> 01:24:42.080
Oh. WeII, you can
caII my peopIe and see
what they can work out.

01:24:42.157 --> 01:24:45.251
Okay. WeII, teII
your peopIe that
I Ioved your articIe.

01:24:45.327 --> 01:24:47.318
Thank you
so much, Joanne.

01:24:47.396 --> 01:24:49.523
And the cover photo
is amazing.

01:24:49.598 --> 01:24:51.828
You're not so
bad, you know.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.596
So, my article comes
out and people read it

01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:57.001
and seemed to like it,
which is great.

01:24:57.072 --> 01:24:59.666
l'm onto my next
big piece for Cosmo.

01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:02.733
A story about
helping your boyfriend
become fashion savvy,

01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:05.075
which is no small feat.

01:25:05.147 --> 01:25:07.547
Tom's green division
is up and running,

01:25:07.616 --> 01:25:11.347
and he convinces me to help
out on his presentations
now and again.

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.888
Tom is. . . Tom.

01:25:13.955 --> 01:25:16.480
And there's no leading
man quite like him.

01:25:16.558 --> 01:25:19.994
The little quirks are
precisely the things
that l love.

01:25:20.061 --> 01:25:24.225
lt's our romance and
it's a real romance.

01:25:24.299 --> 01:25:27.996
lt's wonderful because
all the pieces of me fit
with the pieces of him.

01:25:28.069 --> 01:25:29.832
Lane. Lane, I can't
feeI my arm.

01:25:29.905 --> 01:25:32.897
Oh ! I'm sorry.

01:25:45.905 --> 01:25:53.897
