00:03.467 --> 00:04.633
You guys want me back
in the group.

00:04.733 --> 00:07.133
The only way we'd let
you back in, is if you walked...

00:07.233 --> 00:09.867
through the door with a living,
breathing squatch.

00:09.967 --> 00:12.133
[WALT] If it's proof they want,
it's proof they're gonna get.

00:12.233 --> 00:13.567
[DEBBIE]
She cheated on you?

00:13.667 --> 00:16.167
Let me show you what a real
Pool and Spa Depot girl...

00:16.267 --> 00:17.667
can do to boost your sales.

00:17.767 --> 00:18.900
Call my assistant next week...

00:19.000 --> 00:20.400
we'll set up a time for you
to come in.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.600
You've been treating me like a
second-class citizen all day.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.600
Sounds to me like somebody's
a little jealous.

00:24.700 --> 00:25.367
I thought we were friends,
but it's clear to me...

00:25.467 --> 00:27.567
you don't need friends.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.400
It's this Indy Music Fest.
So you want to come with?

00:30.033 --> 00:32.433
Oh, my god!

00:32.533 --> 00:35.533
Someone named Charlotte says
you're dead to her.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.367
VERNON (V.O.)
For the record...

00:46.467 --> 00:49.967
I guess I'm not that good
a driver after all.

00:52.467 --> 00:54.233
It's true what they say...

00:54.333 --> 00:57.533
Déjà Vu ain't just a strip club
in Nashville.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.967
In my defense, it's been
a rough couple days.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.367
Now I know this looks bad.

01:09.467 --> 01:12.433
But at least things can't
get any worse.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.833
Although I had been wrong
before.

( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )

01:26.100 --> 01:28.433
( KNOCK ON DOOR )

01:32.033 --> 01:34.967
Oh, just great.

01:36.933 --> 01:37.933
Hello, Vernon.
Hey.

01:38.033 --> 01:39.667
How are you?

01:39.767 --> 01:40.967
Thought I'd pop by and pay the
pizza party forward.

01:41.067 --> 01:45.500
You know what? Ah, it's really
not a good time right now.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.000
Oh, c'mon, any time is a good
time for a pizza party!

01:48.100 --> 01:49.967
My mother is upstairs
sleeping...

01:50.067 --> 01:51.400
so it's not a good time.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.167
Man, well, I've been going
through a bit of a tough time...

01:55.267 --> 01:58.233
man, and I know you know how it
is to go through a tough time...

01:58.333 --> 01:59.900
and all that, just--
Mm-mm!

02:00.000 --> 02:03.267
I don't know what flavor hand
sanitizer you're using there...

02:03.367 --> 02:06.367
D-Train, but it smells
delicious!

02:06.467 --> 02:11.000
Oh... I didn't realize we were
expecting company.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.767
Durwood, this is Vernon Brown.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.900
He just popped by.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.767
Mm, I hate pop-bys.

02:18.867 --> 02:20.600
So do I! I hate 'em!

02:20.700 --> 02:22.000
You and I are like
identical twin brothers.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.000
Might as well make
the best of it.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.067
This pizza ain't gonna
eat itself.

02:25.167 --> 02:26.233
It isn't.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.633
Thank you, my friend.

02:27.733 --> 02:30.267
Hey, Doily, you know, if your
mom is sleeping...

02:30.367 --> 02:32.267
if you wanted to just take
the pizza over to my place--

02:32.367 --> 02:34.533
Ssh, ssh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:34.633 --> 02:37.000
Tammy sleeps lighter
than a box of feathers, just--

02:37.100 --> 02:41.100
Let's just see what we got here.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.667
Agh! No... no, thank you.

02:44.767 --> 02:45.733
What is it?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.433
As an American, I don't know
why anybody...

02:47.533 --> 02:49.867
would choose Canadian bacon.
Yeah.

02:49.967 --> 02:51.167
You might as well walk up to...

02:51.267 --> 02:52.600
an American slaughterhouse
worker...

02:52.700 --> 02:55.667
and punch his entire extended
family right in the mouth.

02:55.767 --> 02:56.800
Right in the mouth.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.933
I'm not sure that's
an accurate analogy...

02:58.033 --> 03:00.600
but that's more pizza for me
and you, I guess.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.333
Well, you know what?
I'm not gonna eat it--

03:03.433 --> 03:05.967
I'm not gonna eat it.
Yeah, I'm a patriot.

03:06.067 --> 03:08.033
There we go... patriot.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.967
Bah-bah-bah-bah.
Bah-bah.

03:10.067 --> 03:12.567
Here's to the U.S. OF A!

03:12.667 --> 03:15.200
You know Debbie said she doesn't
even want to see me no more...

03:15.300 --> 03:17.067
so I can really relate to all
the heartbreak...

03:17.167 --> 03:18.567
that you went through
with Sylvia.

03:18.667 --> 03:25.500
Wha-- Sylvia? First of all, it's
Cynthia.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.200
And my boy and Cynthia are like
two cats in heat right now.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.633
Come on, give me something,
you stallion.

03:28.733 --> 03:30.933
Yeah. Durwood here has been a
real guiding light...

03:31.033 --> 03:32.133
to our inevitable
reconciliation...

03:32.233 --> 03:33.800
I'll tell you that.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.667
Yeah, well, that's great, man,
'cause I kind of feel like...

03:35.767 --> 03:36.900
I've lost all hope,
to be honest with you.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.933
Agh!

03:40.333 --> 03:42.367
Great, Vernon,
you woke Tammy up.

03:42.467 --> 03:45.333
Eh-- don't worry about it,
Doily. I'll take care of it.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.533
Thank you, are you sure?
Are you positive?

03:48.633 --> 03:50.200
Tammy?
Thank you so much, my friend.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.133
Tammy? I'm coming
with your body pillow.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.767
Okay, Vernon, that was fun,
right?

03:53.867 --> 03:57.267
Here we go! Here we go!
Pizza party is over.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.433
That was fun. Thanks for coming.

04:01.033 --> 04:05.667
Um, can I have the pizza back?

04:05.767 --> 04:07.233
You know what, no.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.533
Ronnie, come on, quit stuffin'
your face...

04:15.633 --> 04:18.633
and help me find a family size
box of gravy barrels.

04:18.733 --> 04:22.133
Sorry, babe, didn't come here
to shop. I came to sample.

04:22.233 --> 04:24.600
No... way. Pamela?

04:24.700 --> 04:27.033
You know, I'm gonna go pretend
I randomly ran into her...

04:27.133 --> 04:28.667
so I can brag about my life.

04:28.767 --> 04:29.700
We'll split up.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.367
We can sample more ground
that way.

04:31.933 --> 04:35.900
Our dietary powder
is chock-full of fiber...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.400
but, it's absolutely delicious!

04:39.800 --> 04:46.167
Oh, Pamela! Hey! Aw, look at
you... peddlin' poop powder.

04:46.267 --> 04:47.733
Did you need a sample, Deborah?

04:47.833 --> 04:50.733
Might help unlodge that stick up
your ass.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.167
You know, why not?

04:52.267 --> 04:54.067

04:54.167 --> 04:56.233
now that I'm the Pool
and Spa Depot Girl.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.433
Oh, looks like you've got your
work cut out for you.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.167
Thanks to your porta-potty
passions...

05:00.267 --> 05:01.367
with some faceless carnie.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.700
Vernon didn't seem
to have any complaints.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.867
What did you say?

05:06.967 --> 05:08.100
Oh, he didn't tell you?

05:08.200 --> 05:11.000
Looks like he got off
of your merry-go-round...

05:11.100 --> 05:11.833
and hopped onto mine.

05:11.933 --> 05:16.100
You think I care? I got a man.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.867
Look, baby, I got 12.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.000
Got your mail.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.333
You can keep it, Carl.

05:45.433 --> 05:46.700
But I got the DNA results
you were asking me about...

05:46.800 --> 05:50.300
every single day
for so many months.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.933
Remember, you were like...

05:52.033 --> 05:53.733
"Like where's my expletive,
expletive DNA results, Carl?"

05:53.833 --> 05:56.867
Like I'm the one
that did DNA results...

05:56.967 --> 05:58.567
not just delivered them.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.167
Oh, my god, do you know
what this means?

06:01.267 --> 06:02.733
No.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.167
Six percent undetermined.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.833
It means-- it means my
theory is correct!

06:06.933 --> 06:09.300
Oh--
I was right!

06:09.400 --> 06:11.100
Oh, this is unprofessional.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.333
I was right! I was right!
Uh-huh.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.800
They have to let me back
in the PMS group now.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.700
Okay.

06:19.833 --> 06:20.967
I was right!

06:21.067 --> 06:25.733
Whoo! I'm back, Carl!
I'm back!

06:26.767 --> 06:28.600
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:38.733 --> 06:40.133
Is that him again?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.900
Yeah, all morning.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.667
I'm sorry, baby,
you know I just--

06:43.767 --> 06:46.700
I thought he'd finally gotten
his act together.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.400
I just wish I hadn't wasted my
time on this stupid article.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.900
It's literally eight pages
of what a bastard he is.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.367
Why don't you give it to him?

06:54.467 --> 06:57.400
Let him read it, you know?
He should know how you feel.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.567
No, Mom, no, no, I can't do
that, I just had to get it out.

07:06.900 --> 07:07.933
I love you.

07:08.033 --> 07:10.167
I love you, too.

07:10.267 --> 07:11.433
Even if you don't want
to see him...

07:11.533 --> 07:13.533
I'll support that decision,
okay?

07:32.867 --> 07:36.567
And I know marriage
is a roller coaster.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.233
You know, sometimes there's
highs, sometimes there's lows...

07:40.333 --> 07:43.800
but it's always a thrill!

07:47.100 --> 07:49.167
You okay, Pastor Johnson?

07:49.267 --> 07:50.533
[VERNON]
Where is he?

07:50.633 --> 07:53.033
I need a word with you,
preacher.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.333
Maybe we just need a minute.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.600
Oh, yup! No problem!
Happy to leave!

07:58.700 --> 07:59.767
You know, I knew you were
a dog and a liar...

07:59.867 --> 08:03.200
but I didn't know you
were a con-man, too.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.667
I'm afraid I'm not following.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.467
You wanna take a minute
to calm down?

08:06.567 --> 08:08.267
Don't tell me to calm down!

08:08.367 --> 08:09.233
Well, it's hard not to with
that vein popping out...

08:09.333 --> 08:10.767
of your forehead like--

08:10.867 --> 08:12.133
You know, Charlotte wrote all
about you in her article.

08:12.233 --> 08:15.033
"What it's like to be the
daughter of a one-hit wonder."

08:15.133 --> 08:17.133
It's about my music?

08:17.233 --> 08:19.767
No, jack ass, it's about
all your lies!

08:19.867 --> 08:22.467
I'm sure your P.O.
would love to see this.

08:22.567 --> 08:23.667
Did she turn it in?

08:23.767 --> 08:26.667
No... because unlike you,
she has a heart.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.500
You know, you're nothing
but a selfish prick...

08:29.600 --> 08:31.333
who only cares about his ego...

08:31.433 --> 08:33.967
and his cheap county fair
meat-sundae tryst!

08:34.067 --> 08:36.233
Hey, you are not a county fair--

08:36.333 --> 08:39.100
Not me, idiot!
That slut, Pamela!

08:39.200 --> 08:40.900
Hey, well, wait a minute now.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.833
That was just a momentary lapse
in judgment...

08:43.933 --> 08:46.967
which I deeply regret.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.133
And by the way, that was way
before you and I...

08:49.233 --> 08:51.400
had our super meaningful
boat sex.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.733
You know, save it, Vernon,
this is about Charlotte!

08:52.833 --> 08:55.967
Now I might have fallen
for your white-trash...

08:56.067 --> 08:58.267
Prince Charming act once--

08:58.367 --> 08:59.700
Twice.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.733
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
that night never happened.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.700
( KNOCK ON DOOR )

09:03.800 --> 09:05.033
Pastor Johnson, is everything
okay--

09:05.133 --> 09:07.600
Get out, Gidget!
Okay.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.867
I want you out of our lives,
forever.

09:08.967 --> 09:12.600
You know, Charlotte didn't
want you to see this.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.633
But I think you should know
what an ass[BLEEP] you are.

09:18.667 --> 09:23.400
Hey! I don't need to read this
to tell me what an ass I am.

09:27.833 --> 09:31.933
* Where's your sense
of good lovin' *

09:32.033 --> 09:35.967
* Kick me out the door

I mean, Doily's a pathetic dude!

09:39.433 --> 09:42.400
So what the hell's that make me?

09:42.500 --> 09:43.733
Don't mean to eavesdrop
on you, son...

09:43.833 --> 09:47.933
but during my stay on this
rock called earth...

09:48.033 --> 09:50.867
I found a few truths.

09:50.967 --> 09:55.033
You don't know how to get up
unless you've fallen down.

09:55.133 --> 09:59.167
And you ain't learn your lesson
until your lesson get learned.

09:59.267 --> 10:02.933
Wow... that's deep.
Yeah.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.433
Here's another truth for you.

10:04.533 --> 10:05.933
You can't talk your silly
nonsense...

10:06.033 --> 10:08.700
with my boot shoved up your ass!

10:08.800 --> 10:10.600
You've had enough, gimme that
drink! Get out of my bar!

10:10.700 --> 10:12.500
Hey, you don't want my kind...

10:12.600 --> 10:14.967
then we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree, sir.

10:15.067 --> 10:16.233
Well, you just need to get
the hell out of here.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.867
Come on, let's go!

10:17.967 --> 10:19.467
I'll take wh-- you want--
by god, I'll be glad to go!

10:19.567 --> 10:20.800
All right, don't come back.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.367
I don't want none of your
damn bull[BLEEP]!

10:22.467 --> 10:25.133
You know what? I don't give
a [BLEEP] what you think.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.667
I don't--

10:32.033 --> 10:33.467
Hi, there, how are you?

10:33.567 --> 10:36.267
I'm Debbie, I'm the new
Pool and Spa Depot girl.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.767
Could you just let someone
know I'm here?

10:37.867 --> 10:39.000
Take a seat over there
with the others.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.833
The others?

10:45.800 --> 10:48.733
I'm sorry, I think there's been
some sort of mistake.

10:48.833 --> 10:51.300
See, I am the
Pool and Spa Depot girl.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.800
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

10:52.900 --> 10:53.967
You and everybody else.

10:54.067 --> 10:56.200
Take a seat and fill this out.

10:56.300 --> 11:00.900
Mm, just grow up so fast,
don't they?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.800
Which one's your daughter?

11:11.033 --> 11:13.300
Oh, there she is! Hey, Deb.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.700
There he is, hi!
Thank you so much for coming.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.567
You know, in a million years...

11:17.667 --> 11:19.133
I never would've thought
of having these auditions...

11:19.233 --> 11:20.800
if it hadn't been for you.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.000
Thank you, sweetheart!

11:22.100 --> 11:23.267
I'm just happy to help.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.100
Well, I'm happy you're happy.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.200
Now, being a Pool and Spa Depot
girl...

11:28.300 --> 11:30.967
is about a lot more
than just beauty.

11:31.067 --> 11:35.200
So, let's get started
with round one, the pose-off!

11:35.300 --> 11:37.033
Okay, come on, girls,
let's do it!

11:37.133 --> 11:40.000
Let's see what you got, girls!

11:40.100 --> 11:43.533
( MUSIC PLAYING )

12:19.300 --> 12:21.633
Ladies and gentleman,
may I present...

12:21.733 --> 12:23.867
our ultra-relaxing fountain
feature!

12:23.967 --> 12:29.733
It's the ultimate way to tickle
away anything that tingles!

12:29.833 --> 12:32.233
All right, well, I guess
we've got our two finalists!

12:32.333 --> 12:33.600
Ladies, rest up...

12:33.700 --> 12:36.800
because tomorrow are the finals
and then one of you...

12:36.900 --> 12:40.933
is gonna be crowned the new
Pool and Spa Depot girl!

12:41.033 --> 12:42.600
I can't wait.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.367
Keep waiting, dumb ass.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.833
Kenny, your initiation into the
Paranormal Men's Society...

12:51.933 --> 12:56.467
is a great honor, but you must
be prepared to be mocked.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.200
Can I have the mocking stick?

13:00.300 --> 13:02.033
Muz didn't bring it back.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.200
Seriously... Kenny?

13:04.300 --> 13:06.100
Gentlemen, I'd like
to make a last minute...

13:06.200 --> 13:07.300
addition to the agenda!

13:07.400 --> 13:10.300
You gotta stop coming to our
secret locations...

13:10.400 --> 13:11.967
or we're gonna have to find
a new bar...

13:12.067 --> 13:14.300
to be our secret location.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.167
You wanted proof, there it is.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.900
Dale is the son of Sasquatch!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.633
What's this?

13:22.733 --> 13:24.933
I tested his DNA. The results
speak for themselves.

13:25.033 --> 13:28.767
Six percent, undetermined.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.967
But aren't all humans six
percent undetermined?

13:31.067 --> 13:34.167
Not now, Kenny.

13:34.267 --> 13:35.933
You realize what this means?

13:36.033 --> 13:36.967
I'm back in the group?

13:37.067 --> 13:38.267
You're darn right.

13:38.367 --> 13:39.700
Could we go back to my
initiation?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.867
Shut up, Kenny!

13:41.967 --> 13:46.900
If this is true, all of America
is gonna know about P.M.S...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.867
and what we are capable of.

13:48.967 --> 13:52.633
We could take him on the road.
We could make him fight bears.

13:52.733 --> 13:55.567
We could breed him! I think my
sister would do it with him.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.967
Kenny, no one wants to do it
with your sister! She's gross.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.233
She's gross.

13:59.333 --> 13:59.967
She's pretty attractive.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.800
We are gonna be rich!

14:02.900 --> 14:06.300
I hear Sasquatch toes go for
big money on the black market!

14:06.400 --> 14:10.200
After ivory and gluten-free
meth!

14:10.300 --> 14:12.100
Uh, I think we should be
more responsible...

14:12.200 --> 14:14.333
with the way we deal with him.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.567
I don't think we should just
kill him right away.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.500
I think we should be friends
with him.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.200
We could work with him,
you know? Like, as a team.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.633
Let me stop you right there.

14:21.733 --> 14:24.767
I want to mount his head
above my fireplace, right?

14:24.867 --> 14:27.333
And then we pop his eye balls
out and we juggle 'em...

14:27.433 --> 14:30.200
in a traveling road show.

14:30.967 --> 14:35.167
Ha-ha! I was just messi''
with you idiots!

14:35.267 --> 14:38.033
Son of Sasquatch...
it's ridiculous.

14:38.133 --> 14:41.600
I-I'm sorry, I don't know what
you're saying right now, Walt.

14:41.700 --> 14:45.267
I was making the whole thing up,
just to mess with you guys.

14:45.367 --> 14:46.400
You guys are so stupid.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.700
Oh, I know, we can breed him
with my sister.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.867
You idiots! You should have seen
the look on your faces.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.933
That's not funny, Walt! It's not
funny when it happens to us.

15:10.433 --> 15:14.267
You just got yourself re-kicked
out of the group!

15:14.367 --> 15:17.000
Kenny, make a note
in the log book!

15:17.100 --> 15:18.900
Well, Muz has that, too.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.233
I hate you so much right now,
Kenny! You get lost, Walt!

15:23.333 --> 15:27.867
Gentlemen, it has been
a pleasure.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.900
Not.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.233
That's it! New secret location,
Fuddruckers Main Street!

15:35.333 --> 15:35.933
[WALT]
Heard that!

15:36.033 --> 15:38.700
Guys!
Get lost!

15:43.167 --> 15:47.700
Hey! Hey! Whoo!

15:47.800 --> 15:50.133
Easy, ese! I could've
killed you, man!

15:50.233 --> 15:54.833
You do not know how bad
I need a taco!

15:54.933 --> 15:58.333
Me, hungry! You, taco!

16:01.367 --> 16:02.500
You shoulda seen the way...

16:02.600 --> 16:05.100
my little girl looked at me,
Taco Steve.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.467
Then she wrote this.

16:08.567 --> 16:13.233
It's all in there...
right there!

16:13.333 --> 16:18.333
She wrote it about what
a crap ass dad I am.

16:18.433 --> 16:22.833
I can't read it.
I can't read it!

16:22.933 --> 16:24.000
It is hard.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.667
No, I mean, I really can't
logistically read it.

16:26.767 --> 16:29.967
I'm seeing double.
Would you read it to me, Taco?

16:30.067 --> 16:31.667
Okay.

16:37.867 --> 16:43.567
"My dad...
he has many talents...

16:43.667 --> 16:48.000
but being a father...
is not one of them.

16:48.233 --> 16:52.167
What it means, dead-beat?

16:52.267 --> 16:55.133
She's right about that, too.

16:55.233 --> 16:57.767
Everything she wrote is right.

16:57.867 --> 17:01.600
I have not been a very good dad.

17:01.700 --> 17:06.467
You know, it's never
too late to change.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.167
I believe it was Arnold Bennett
who wrote...

17:09.267 --> 17:12.367
"The chief beauty of time...

17:12.467 --> 17:15.500
is that you cannot waste
it in advance."

17:15.600 --> 17:19.633
Wow, I was not expecting that,
Taco.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.367
That's some deep [BLEEP] there!

17:22.467 --> 17:27.367
I know exactly what I gotta do!
Take me to church!

17:27.467 --> 17:29.433
You mean a different church?

17:29.533 --> 17:35.433
You wait here!
I'll be right back.

17:38.033 --> 17:41.567
Ladies and gentlemen,
what a nail-biter!

17:41.667 --> 17:42.600
After yesterday's events...

17:42.700 --> 17:45.533
we are down to our final
two contestants.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.067
These two lovely, young ladies
are neck-and-neck.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.067
Not for long, bitch.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.567
Dream on, trick whore.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.400
Now this next question
is for you, Miss Jackie.

17:53.500 --> 17:58.867
Who was the original
Pool and Spa Depot girl?

17:58.967 --> 18:03.000
I think the original Pool and
Spa Depot girl was someone...

18:03.100 --> 18:08.800
who knows pools and spas and
depots, and it was someone...

18:08.900 --> 18:12.567
that that they um, they rea--
people really liked!

18:12.667 --> 18:14.933
Oh, sorry, that's incorrect.

18:15.033 --> 18:17.700
That means, Debbie,
that if you can answer this--

18:17.800 --> 18:21.067
It was me! I was the original
Pool and Spa Depot girl!

18:21.167 --> 18:22.233
Debbie Lynn Cooke!

18:22.333 --> 18:24.400
That is absolutely right!

18:24.500 --> 18:26.300
Ladies and Gentleman,
may I present...

18:26.400 --> 18:30.067
the new Pool and Spa Depot girl!

* And now here she is the
new Spa and Pool Depot girl *

18:38.400 --> 18:40.633
You gave that to me, didn't you?

18:40.733 --> 18:43.133
Well, you worked for it,
kind of.

18:43.233 --> 18:46.400
( MUSIC PLAYING )

19:08.500 --> 19:10.933
Well, I guess that makes us
square.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.700
The P.M.S. guys don't sell you
for parts...

19:12.800 --> 19:17.167
and I'll pretend not to know
who your actual father is.

19:17.267 --> 19:20.667
Did-- did you tranq me again?

19:20.767 --> 19:23.733
Look, let's not make this about
who tranq'ed who, Dale.

19:23.833 --> 19:27.233
The most important thing is,
your secret is safe with me.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.567
You're free to go home now...

in the forest.

man?

19:33.100 --> 19:37.467
I have a house. I cooked you--
I cooked you frittata?

19:39.267 --> 19:42.333
Time for you to go, Dale.
No.

19:42.433 --> 19:46.900
You're finally home.
Go! Be free!

19:47.000 --> 19:53.333
I don't live here. I live
like eight miles that way.

19:53.433 --> 19:56.267
Just go, Dale! Go to your home!

19:56.367 --> 19:58.033
I need a ride, man!

where you going?

20:05.067 --> 20:05.967
Come on, man!

Come on, Taco! We're getting
the hell out of here!

anyone to read her letter.

But I've hurt way too many
people...

it right.

hates me enough...
