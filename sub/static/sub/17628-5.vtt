<i>Previously on <b>SALEM</b>...</i>

00:02.633 --> 00:05.802
Calm yourself. You're still reeling
from the loss of your powers.

00:05.826 --> 00:08.895
In time, you will once again get
used to being a mere creature.

00:09.078 --> 00:12.520
You ever think you knew a man and come to
find out you didn't know what he was at all.

00:12.544 --> 00:15.746
Real witches
walked free and still do.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.217
If only I could get one, and I
know which one I want... Mercy.

00:20.251 --> 00:22.553
We can become anything.

00:22.587 --> 00:26.523
We might even fashion ourselves
into the rulers of Salem.

00:26.558 --> 00:30.160
You think John Alden is the man
who stands between you and I?

00:30.195 --> 00:32.830
- If not Alden, who then?
- My son.

00:32.864 --> 00:35.499
I will have things as I
wish them, or all will pay.

00:35.533 --> 00:38.402
Just one little step,

00:38.436 --> 00:40.537
and wipe all the horrors
from your heart.

00:40.572 --> 00:42.773
I do have a choice, unlike you.

00:42.807 --> 00:45.142
I'm no puppet. I am free!

00:45.176 --> 00:47.578
You just found somebody
else to pull your strings.

00:47.612 --> 00:50.781
So, your Cotton will not
make it to Boston, will he?

00:50.815 --> 00:53.150
Your love still sleeps.

00:53.184 --> 00:54.151
A child?

00:54.185 --> 00:56.153
If you abandon Salem now,

00:56.187 --> 00:58.856
you will never see that baby alive.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.290
They are winning.

01:00.325 --> 01:01.502
Well, they picked the wrong witch

01:01.526 --> 01:02.726
and the wrong woman.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.462
Hell have no fury like
this woman scorned.

01:05.495 --> 01:07.685
Who is this legendary John Alden?

01:07.710 --> 01:09.110
I am.

Stay dead!

01:57.544 --> 01:59.411
How do you kill something
that's already dead?

02:51.431 --> 02:52.564
No.

02:54.934 --> 02:56.468
No, no.

03:00.774 --> 03:02.541

04:03.903 --> 04:06.939
Please stop!

04:11.638 --> 04:13.739
You enjoy human suffering.

04:14.941 --> 04:18.510
The cry of animals merely depresses me.

04:18.545 --> 04:22.781
People are not animals but puppets...
dolls, toys.

04:23.119 --> 04:25.961
And toys are meant to be played with.

04:25.986 --> 04:28.220
I do believe a few more strokes

04:28.254 --> 04:30.322
and your toy will be dead.

04:31.257 --> 04:32.657
She deserves it.

04:32.659 --> 04:35.828
But the innocent life
inside her womb does not!

04:38.431 --> 04:41.734
She is with child.

04:41.768 --> 04:43.635
And it signed no contract with you.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.805
Slit his throat and be done with it.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.976
You promised great reward to the
one who delivers me to you.

04:51.011 --> 04:54.246
Well, I have delivered myself
and so claim the reward.

05:04.891 --> 05:06.291
Release him.

05:09.295 --> 05:10.963
And what do you want?

05:12.399 --> 05:13.532
I want her.

05:13.566 --> 05:17.269
Safe and sound.

05:17.303 --> 05:20.272
How dull and selfless.

05:20.306 --> 05:22.274
But so be it.

05:28.615 --> 05:30.749
And I thank you.

05:30.784 --> 05:34.386
Not least for proving I
was right to choose you.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.422
For what?

05:36.456 --> 05:38.891
To be my Moses.

<b>Marilyn Manson & Tyler Bates</b>

05:56.476 --> 05:59.344
What are you doing here? Is it John?

05:59.379 --> 06:01.447
'Tis not John Alden I'm worried about.

06:01.481 --> 06:02.448
It's you.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.550
This is madness.

06:04.584 --> 06:07.352
They will sense you
here and kill us both.

06:07.387 --> 06:10.456
Well, they shall have to be satisfied
with killing just you.

06:10.490 --> 06:12.891
I, of course, am not really here.

06:12.926 --> 06:17.429
Yes, you always were willing
to risk my life for your own cause.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.599
No, sister. This time, I
risk everything to warn you.

06:20.633 --> 06:22.301
Warn me?

06:22.335 --> 06:24.803
I've died, been torn from my grave,

06:24.838 --> 06:27.639
had my powers ripped from me as
if they were my soul's spine,

06:27.674 --> 06:31.610
and yet I am still here. What could
possibly have to warn me of?

06:31.644 --> 06:34.913
You have come back from your Reckoning
stronger than they know.

06:34.948 --> 06:37.583
But you should never have
returned back to the Essex tree.

06:37.617 --> 06:39.318
They sought to rescue me,

06:39.352 --> 06:41.553
but I told them I didn't need rescuing,

06:41.588 --> 06:43.989
though I swear my enemies will.

06:44.023 --> 06:47.092
Then perhaps that's not
why they brought you out.

06:48.628 --> 06:50.596
You doubt them?

06:50.630 --> 06:55.801
When you begged them to join you in your war
against the Countess Marburg, what did they say?

06:55.835 --> 06:59.004
They refused. Sought
only their own survival.

06:59.038 --> 07:03.909
But if you distrust them,
why go to them to resurrect me?

07:03.943 --> 07:07.479
We needed their powers, the powers of
the Essex roots, to bring you back.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.749
- Do you think we've alreadybeen betrayed?
- Do you?

07:10.783 --> 07:12.918
One thing has nagged at me.

07:12.952 --> 07:16.054
When I returned, my son did
not seem surprised, as if...

07:16.089 --> 07:18.757
As if he knew you were coming.

07:18.791 --> 07:20.191
Yes.

07:20.193 --> 07:23.428
You are in greater danger
than we could've known.

07:23.463 --> 07:26.765
If you would survive, trust no one.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.834
You examine the Essex.

07:28.868 --> 07:31.370
Leave me to make my first move.

07:31.404 --> 07:32.604
Which is?

07:32.639 --> 07:34.873
Why, to trust no one, of course.

07:45.718 --> 07:52.090
They said you are to return to the mansion
right away, to stay there without me.

07:53.693 --> 07:56.128
Devil wants me to be his biographer.

07:57.697 --> 08:02.201
To recount his glorious failed
rebellion against the tyrant God.

08:03.603 --> 08:05.704
It is a cosmic joke.

08:08.775 --> 08:11.777
But I am grateful that
he has spared you.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.917
Almost as grateful as I
am that you spared me.

08:28.127 --> 08:30.729
Why did you?

08:30.763 --> 08:35.767
You were free. And you cannot
possibly still love me.

08:38.136 --> 08:39.705
You carry my child.

08:41.774 --> 08:43.909
How can you know such a thing?

08:45.545 --> 08:47.179
I had a vision.

08:47.213 --> 08:49.081
A vision?

08:50.950 --> 08:54.786
The curtains of time parted.

08:54.821 --> 08:59.625
For a moment, I saw...

08:59.659 --> 09:01.059
our child to come.

09:06.099 --> 09:10.302
I know it in my heart, in my bones...

09:13.773 --> 09:15.340
I am to be a father.

09:18.611 --> 09:24.283
And, boy or girl,

09:24.317 --> 09:26.818
we will call you Hope.

09:31.791 --> 09:35.560
And I will prove that
I deserve your faith

09:35.595 --> 09:38.196
and our Hope

09:38.231 --> 09:41.300
through my charity -

09:41.334 --> 09:46.138
for all the good I will do
for the souls of Salem.

10:02.922 --> 10:04.322
She's still not back.

10:43.629 --> 10:45.263
Time to go back to where you belong.

10:54.874 --> 10:57.275
Go back, go back. Go.

11:01.247 --> 11:04.950
Over this road
shall be your nest.

11:04.984 --> 11:07.285
And I promise you shall
never again have to sleep

11:07.320 --> 11:09.688
without a meal in your stomach

11:09.722 --> 11:11.757
or a warm fire in the hearth.

11:44.056 --> 11:45.757
Dispatch her!

11:53.433 --> 11:54.833
No, no!

11:59.980 --> 12:02.965
Angel slew angel
as we fought our way up Mount Zaphon.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.557
As my troops and I crested the ridge,

12:06.592 --> 12:10.428
we saw the face of God, our Father,

12:10.462 --> 12:14.065
for once shining no light,
but darkness visible.

12:14.099 --> 12:19.303
I couldn't tell if he was
laughing or crying or both.

12:22.482 --> 12:25.505
Some Moses you'll make. You've
not written a thing down.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.579
You have seen the very face of God.

12:28.614 --> 12:32.717
And His ass. It wasn't always
easy to tell them apart.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.286
Blasphemy.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.256
Truth is blasphemy.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.526
All power corrupts.

12:41.560 --> 12:46.163
And God's divine power is no exception.

12:47.566 --> 12:51.369
Our rebellion against
Him was entirely just.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.509
Just or unjust, your rebellion failed.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.611
Yes, we failed.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.014
And we fell to a place
so far from the light

13:03.048 --> 13:05.616
that we forgot what light,
and life, even was.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.085
- We call it Hell.
- We called it Home.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.627
Am I really to take this all down...

13:16.662 --> 13:19.764
yours and the Devil's account?

13:25.337 --> 13:27.204
You're a scrivener, no?

13:30.075 --> 13:33.444
I have sold more books
than any man in the land.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.048
Then keep scribbling.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.333
Hey. Hey. Hey.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.567
Stay awake. Stay awake.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.135
Stay alive. Trust me.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.072
If you fall asleep,
you will not wake up.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.708
I can't let that happen
to my best soldier.

14:05.677 --> 14:10.557
Open up. Come on.
There you go. Swallow it.

14:10.582 --> 14:13.261
There you go. Let's
see what we got here.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.554
No.
Please. Don't.

14:16.588 --> 14:18.322
I need to treat your wound, son.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.590
- No. Leave it.
- Billy.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.158
No.

14:46.184 --> 14:48.352
I'm sorry.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.632
Wise mother, was this your plan?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.801
Did you know what the Devil intends?

15:03.835 --> 15:06.771
Do you plan to rule a
kingdom of death and dust?

15:08.340 --> 15:10.841
<i>All comes from dust. And all returns.</i>

15:10.876 --> 15:12.810
<i>The end he brings is a new beginning.</i>

15:12.844 --> 15:15.312
But not for me.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.481
I love the only woman in
the world I cannot have.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.550
<i>Your Mary is no longer a witch.</i>

15:19.584 --> 15:22.186
<i>She is subject to the craft.</i>

15:22.220 --> 15:23.688
No.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.657
I might as well please
myself with a hand puppet.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.693
I need to be loved truly and freely.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.661
I will not use magic to win love.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.863
<i>All love is magic.</i>

15:32.898 --> 15:37.735
<i>There's no difference between a love
spell, a love sonnet, or a longing look.</i>

15:37.769 --> 15:41.706
<i>It is all the invisible touch...
just seduction through the air.</i>

15:41.740 --> 15:43.908
She <b>seems</b> to have lost her
taste for love sonnets

15:43.942 --> 15:45.476
and <b>seems</b> quite immune to my looks.

15:45.510 --> 15:48.212
<i>Life is wasted on the living.</i>

15:48.246 --> 15:51.649
<i>I could make love better as a
corpse than you in your prime.</i>

15:51.683 --> 15:55.619
<i>Give her what she wants before
she even knows what she wants.</i>

15:55.654 --> 15:58.556
<i>And then soon enough, she'll want you.</i>

15:58.590 --> 15:59.990
How?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.394
Tell me.

16:03.428 --> 16:04.962
What must I do?

16:04.996 --> 16:08.999
<i>Mary Sibley... bring me her blood.</i>

17:32.951 --> 17:35.286
What are you doing in my chambers?

17:35.320 --> 17:39.323
I came to find my Lord,
to see what I might do for you.

17:39.357 --> 17:42.560
I have no need of you... for now.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.445
<i>Now feed it to me.</i>

18:05.483 --> 18:06.417
<i>No.</i>

18:06.451 --> 18:09.386
<i>From your lips.</i>

18:51.897 --> 18:53.731
Brother, who is your opponent?

18:53.765 --> 18:55.165
Who else?

18:56.001 --> 18:57.601
Our Father?

18:59.037 --> 19:00.070
Surely not.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.674
Who else but God
is worthy to stand against me?

19:03.708 --> 19:04.942
Have you yet won a match?

19:04.976 --> 19:07.578
No. Always stalemate.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.455
Pardon me.

19:26.031 --> 19:29.967
Mother, you seem different.

19:30.001 --> 19:31.902
What has happened?

19:34.839 --> 19:36.840
A realization of sorts.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.079
Your Reckoning took all my powers.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.783
Left me with nothing but my failures.

19:47.185 --> 19:49.420
Suicide seemed the only way.

19:49.454 --> 19:50.554
Suicide?

19:50.588 --> 19:53.991
I heard a voice...

19:54.025 --> 19:57.027
tempted me to an eternal sleep.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.129
What voice?

20:01.666 --> 20:03.066
Who would dare?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.771
Only my conscience.

20:09.574 --> 20:11.108
And I understood.

20:13.511 --> 20:18.482
All the horrors of my life are
the result of my own will.

20:18.516 --> 20:22.119
I have tried everything 
but submission...

20:24.956 --> 20:28.192
to my fate... to you...

20:28.226 --> 20:31.195
who are my fate.

20:31.229 --> 20:36.233
So I come humbly to ask.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.238
Give me a reason to live.

20:41.272 --> 20:47.211
Some small sense of why you have
preserved me and what lies before me.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.113
I shall, dear mother.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.748
I shall.

20:52.617 --> 20:54.017
Out.

21:07.332 --> 21:12.002
I am here to fulfill the
promise of your existence.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.837
I do not understand.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.308
When my father took on a suit of flesh,

21:18.343 --> 21:21.678
he required two Marys...

21:21.713 --> 21:25.616
one to birth him and one to love him.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.720
But I need only one Mary.

21:29.754 --> 21:31.255
You.

21:31.289 --> 21:35.159
My mother and my bride.

21:52.977 --> 21:59.316
And then we shall rule,
not this New World, but all worlds.

21:59.350 --> 22:04.188
You will not be the queen of Salem,
but of the universe.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.256
An immortal.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.258
A goddess.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.782
I suppose you must be very beautiful.

22:48.816 --> 22:50.817
Is that your version of a compliment?

22:50.851 --> 22:52.953
Why did you do it?

22:52.987 --> 22:53.954
What?

22:53.988 --> 22:56.957
Lie for me.

22:56.991 --> 23:01.227
We both know it was not your conscience that
nearly led you to destroy yourself, but me.

23:01.262 --> 23:04.197
Why did you not tell him?

23:04.231 --> 23:07.500
Sometimes, we humans act
without knowing why.

23:07.535 --> 23:10.503
Acting on impulse is our nature.

23:10.538 --> 23:14.140
Sometimes we know
before we know we know.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.875
And what is it you now know?

23:15.910 --> 23:20.880
What that stony face hides...
your compassion.

23:23.017 --> 23:26.987
You exploited my pain and suffering
because you understood them.

23:27.021 --> 23:29.522
That boy has never thought to
use my own guilt against me

23:29.557 --> 23:33.526
because he could never
feel such a thing.

23:33.561 --> 23:35.395
And knowing that,

23:35.429 --> 23:37.297
I believe we may yet
find ourselves allies.

23:37.331 --> 23:38.365
How so?

23:38.399 --> 23:41.801
He has plans for me, 
plans I cannot imagine you would favor.

23:41.836 --> 23:42.969
Tell me.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.205
Firstly, answer my question,

23:45.239 --> 23:47.440
and I will tell you what I know.

23:48.576 --> 23:51.378
Do you have a spy within my hive?

23:54.315 --> 23:55.482
Who is it?

23:55.516 --> 23:58.518
That I do not know.

23:58.552 --> 24:00.520
Samael meets with them alone.

24:04.058 --> 24:07.060
And now I have made this small
betrayal, it is your turn.

24:10.197 --> 24:13.266
He wants me to be his Queen,

24:13.300 --> 24:14.567
a Goddess,

24:14.602 --> 24:16.069
which would make him...

24:16.104 --> 24:18.105
God.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.610
The coming terror serves that purpose,

24:22.643 --> 24:25.278
rendering us both something
more than what we are.

24:25.312 --> 24:29.916
And of me, and the freeing of
my brothers imprisoned in Hell?

24:31.152 --> 24:32.619
Not a word.

24:41.562 --> 24:43.263
This was to be our time.

24:43.297 --> 24:44.931
Revenge against God.

24:44.965 --> 24:47.000
A chance to free our brothers from Hell

24:47.034 --> 24:50.036
and make this world our kingdom.

24:50.071 --> 24:55.542
We did not suffer and
survive the wrath of God

24:55.576 --> 24:58.111
only to make you God instead.

24:58.145 --> 25:00.513
Be careful how you speak to me.

25:00.548 --> 25:02.315
You are first among equals.

25:02.349 --> 25:05.952
Stronger than I or any of our brothers,

25:05.986 --> 25:09.489
but you are not stronger than all of us.

25:10.691 --> 25:12.525
Brother, is that some kind of threat?

25:15.496 --> 25:19.332
If that time comes, I won't
waste time with threats.

25:28.309 --> 25:31.244
There is a traitor here amongst us.

25:34.014 --> 25:36.483
Now she will tell us who it is.

26:03.310 --> 26:05.411
You.

26:05.446 --> 26:07.180
Foul worm.

26:07.214 --> 26:09.315
Trade us all,

26:09.350 --> 26:12.452
trade all the world, 
for your worthless life!

26:12.486 --> 26:14.154
You are absolutely certain?

26:14.188 --> 26:16.356
There can be no doubt.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.992
Here. See what I saw.

26:21.562 --> 26:24.597
You must keep a
close eye on my mother.

26:24.632 --> 26:26.032
Send her to me.

26:30.104 --> 26:33.506
All I have promised you,
I will give you in the end.

26:38.445 --> 26:40.146
Traitor.

26:40.181 --> 26:42.148
No. The bitch lies.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.616
I am innocent.

26:45.085 --> 26:50.356
Branches of birth on the tree of life,

26:50.391 --> 26:54.327
leaves of desire and bark of strife.

26:54.361 --> 26:56.329
- No. No!
- Roots of the sun,

26:56.363 --> 26:57.407
- roots of the moon...
- No!

26:57.431 --> 26:58.731
Heed our call,

26:58.766 --> 27:01.301
bring this traitor's doom.

27:01.335 --> 27:04.771
Heed our call.
Bring this traitor's doom!

27:05.078 --> 27:08.881
Heed our call. 
Bring this traitor's doom!

27:11.245 --> 27:13.479
Heed our call. 
Bring this traitor's doom!

27:14.848 --> 27:18.618
Heed our call. 
Bring this traitor's doom!

27:22.089 --> 27:24.757
Stop it. It's not...

27:24.792 --> 27:27.327
We both know I'm not gonna make it.

27:36.704 --> 27:39.772
It's like a ballad.

27:39.807 --> 27:44.310
The sad ballad of Billy
who weren't really a man.

27:52.586 --> 27:56.623
I kind of want at least
one person to know...

27:56.657 --> 28:01.261
who I was... and why.

28:04.632 --> 28:07.867
The Indians scalped my
father in front of me.

28:10.638 --> 28:14.207
Rounded up the women,

28:14.241 --> 28:19.178
tied us together like livestock,

28:19.213 --> 28:21.180
dragged us into the woods.

28:23.284 --> 28:29.489
The Abenaki raped my sister
and slit her throat.

28:34.895 --> 28:39.399
All the while, my mother kept saying,

28:39.433 --> 28:42.568
"Your uncles will come for us.

28:42.603 --> 28:46.906
They'll hire the great
John Alden to ransom us."

28:50.811 --> 28:55.848
She was waiting for a man to save us.

28:55.883 --> 28:57.950
And I was waiting for you.

29:00.821 --> 29:04.657
But you never came.

29:04.692 --> 29:07.193
No man did.

29:13.801 --> 29:18.204
The only thing I ever wanted to be

29:18.238 --> 29:22.208
is the one thing no woman
is allowed to be...

29:26.714 --> 29:28.781
A warrior.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.287
To take revenge for my family.

29:35.589 --> 29:38.624
Just sorry I failed.

29:38.659 --> 29:40.293
You didn't fail.

29:42.463 --> 29:44.530
You're right.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.965
I didn't.

29:49.436 --> 29:51.437
I got to meet my hero.

29:55.409 --> 30:00.980
And maybe reminded him that he is one.

30:14.862 --> 30:19.833
Hathorne, Marburg, Mather.

30:19.867 --> 30:21.267
Arrogant fools.

30:21.269 --> 30:24.504
And with John Alden lost...

30:24.539 --> 30:29.076
probably dead in the woods...

30:29.110 --> 30:31.445
the people remain terrified,

30:31.479 --> 30:34.581
utterly without confidence
in their leadership.

30:34.615 --> 30:38.485
I may have lost a battle,
but I'm winning the war.

30:38.519 --> 30:41.265
Hathorne stands no chance when I
challenge him for the leadership.

30:41.289 --> 30:43.690
Not with the will of
the people behind me.

30:46.027 --> 30:47.994
Don't you agree, Mr. Dinley?

30:48.029 --> 30:51.164
I do.

30:51.199 --> 30:53.567
There's just one thing
that can stop you.

31:13.087 --> 31:16.957
You could have done it sooner
and spared my ears his noxious voice.

31:18.359 --> 31:23.997
No. See, I listen until it builds
into something like a roar.

31:24.031 --> 31:28.268
And then I wait for that
perfect moment to silence him.

31:33.174 --> 31:36.109
See, murder is a fine art.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.019
I would have done it just
for the Dark Lord's honor.

31:47.555 --> 31:51.224
Or just for the sheer pleasure of it.

31:51.259 --> 31:53.693
Well, you shall have
much pleasure to come.

31:54.695 --> 31:57.030
The Dark Lord always
rewards the faithful.

31:57.064 --> 32:00.667
Do you need any help
disposing of the body?

32:00.701 --> 32:02.135
Of course not.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.303
Excellent.

32:07.408 --> 32:10.410
Would you like a meat pie for the road?

34:41.495 --> 34:42.495
Cotton.

34:42.530 --> 34:46.299
You!

34:46.333 --> 34:48.368
I am not here to hurt you.

34:48.402 --> 34:49.735
I am here to help you.

34:49.770 --> 34:51.737
Like you helped me kill my father?

34:51.772 --> 34:53.873
I cannot undo the wrongs I've done.

34:53.908 --> 34:56.176
I can only beg for your forgiveness

34:56.210 --> 34:58.378
and tell you I am not
the woman I was then.

34:58.412 --> 35:00.780
No, then who are you?

35:00.815 --> 35:03.350
The whore of Babylon?

35:03.384 --> 35:06.586
What else should I call the woman who
brought the Devil himself to earth?!

35:06.621 --> 35:09.689
- We did that together. You and I.
- I had nothing to do with it!

35:09.724 --> 35:12.392
Puritan hate is as responsible
for raising the Devil

35:12.426 --> 35:13.826
as any witch's malice.

35:13.828 --> 35:18.098
You still think that you can
manipulate me so easily,

35:18.132 --> 35:19.633
you lying witch.

35:26.140 --> 35:27.440
No, I cannot.

35:27.475 --> 35:29.643
Not least of all because I am no witch.

35:29.677 --> 35:31.878
The Devil himself tore up my contract.

35:33.347 --> 35:36.182
The Devil freed you?

35:36.217 --> 35:39.486
In all of recorded history, such
a thing has never happened.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.554
Given your history of saying and doing

35:41.589 --> 35:42.889
anything and everything

35:42.923 --> 35:46.660
to get your way, I don't
think I believe you.

35:50.765 --> 35:53.767
Believe me or not,
the Devil is here, Cotton Mather.

35:53.801 --> 35:57.537
And whether he merely walks
this earth or rules it,

35:57.571 --> 36:00.240
may be up to the two of us.

36:32.707 --> 36:35.475
Where is she?

36:39.246 --> 36:41.381
My angel.

36:42.683 --> 36:43.817
My angel.

36:43.851 --> 36:47.854
- Who did this?
- My own men.

36:47.888 --> 36:50.390
What would possess them
to do such a thing?

36:50.424 --> 36:52.559
Please.

36:52.593 --> 36:54.828
Perhaps it is simply justice.

36:56.497 --> 36:59.532
The great circle of pain rolls on.

37:00.534 --> 37:04.471
But how many times in my short
life must I be ground to dust?

37:11.045 --> 37:14.414
I do not think I have it
left in me to try again.

37:14.448 --> 37:18.251
I-I know why you've come.

37:21.355 --> 37:22.655
Here.

37:22.690 --> 37:25.358
Drink it, all of it this time.

37:25.392 --> 37:29.295
And you, too, shall be
free of my hold forever.

37:53.621 --> 37:55.688
But I've given you your freedom.

37:55.723 --> 37:57.924
I do not want it.

37:59.960 --> 38:06.399
I would only long for the
freedom of my chains.

38:13.841 --> 38:14.974
Shh.

38:16.710 --> 38:18.344
Fetch Dinley.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.880
Tell him money's no matter.
He's needed immediately.

38:20.915 --> 38:24.751
No. A surgeon's no use.

38:24.785 --> 38:26.553
Only blood can save me now.

38:29.723 --> 38:32.392
I haven't the heart to take their blood.

38:32.426 --> 38:36.796
No, Mistress, no need to take it.

38:38.499 --> 38:40.767
We give it to you freely.

39:24.501 --> 39:27.537
What brings you here at this hour?

39:27.571 --> 39:30.907
No doctor in town will
serve the refugees.

39:32.431 --> 39:34.532
So I go to offer my few herbal skills.

39:36.802 --> 39:40.972
But first, I came to say good night.

39:51.583 --> 39:53.484
I'm glad you did.

39:55.888 --> 39:58.022
Your shining face and soft lips

39:58.056 --> 40:00.358
do much to calm the storms in me.

40:00.392 --> 40:02.426
All will be well.

40:02.461 --> 40:06.497
I know it. Your...
your vision proves it.

40:06.532 --> 40:07.798
You don't need to trust me.

40:07.833 --> 40:09.567
Just trust your vision.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.337
And our Hope.

40:20.879 --> 40:21.879
Here you are.

40:21.914 --> 40:23.714
Thank you.

40:23.749 --> 40:24.949
Who else is hungry?

40:24.983 --> 40:27.018
Here's more bread.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.519
Mrs. Mather.

40:28.554 --> 40:29.887
Please. Please!

40:29.922 --> 40:31.923
- Yes?
- There's one with child.

40:31.957 --> 40:33.424
Will you have a look?

40:33.458 --> 40:36.494
With child? How many weeks?
Where is she?

40:36.528 --> 40:39.664
She walked the entire distance
from Boston, or so be her claim.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.432
From Boston? For God's sake, why?

40:41.466 --> 40:43.434
To find the baby's father.

40:48.874 --> 40:52.677
I am here. Allow me.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.011
- Please. Please.
- Shh. Sister.

40:54.046 --> 40:56.681
Please help my baby.

40:59.952 --> 41:01.719
I feel a strong heartbeat.

41:01.753 --> 41:04.989
Your baby's fine. It's you
that needs proper care.

41:05.023 --> 41:07.825
- What's your name?
- Gloriana.

41:07.859 --> 41:10.428
I need to find him.

41:10.462 --> 41:12.563
If you find him, I know he can help.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.966
Find who? The baby's father?

41:15.000 --> 41:17.535
I can help you find him
if you tell me his name.

41:22.507 --> 41:24.108
Cotton Mather.

41:27.446 --> 41:29.880
Cotton.

41:37.923 --> 41:39.957
What do you want?

41:39.992 --> 41:41.826
<i>Not what I want.</i>

41:44.463 --> 41:47.865
I manage this house and
hold keys to many doors.

41:50.002 --> 41:52.970
And what will this one unlock?

41:53.005 --> 41:54.772
Something you want.

41:56.141 --> 41:57.642
Come see.

41:59.306 --> 42:02.341
It wasn't I who took all this from you.

42:02.376 --> 42:05.611
But it gives me great pleasure

42:05.646 --> 42:07.814
to be the one to restore it to you.

42:51.124 --> 42:55.094
I don't know how you knew,
but you were right.

42:55.128 --> 42:57.864
This is what I wanted.

42:57.898 --> 42:59.398
Thank you.

43:18.185 --> 43:20.319
I see you have not lost your touch.

43:22.155 --> 43:24.357
Destroying an Essex Witch

43:24.391 --> 43:27.159
with the very tree from which
he derived his powers.

43:27.194 --> 43:28.694
I had to act.

43:28.729 --> 43:32.164
I have sown mistrust
between Mary and the Hive.

43:32.199 --> 43:34.800
Once again, I have done all
that you've asked of me.

43:34.836 --> 43:36.303
So the time has come for you to...

43:36.336 --> 43:37.736
No.

43:39.306 --> 43:42.909
I have resurrected
and delivered Mary Sibley to you.

43:42.943 --> 43:46.345
I have kept John Alden
far from your door.

43:46.380 --> 43:48.681
And then, I sent you Cotton Mather

43:48.715 --> 43:50.917
when all your other witches failed.

43:50.951 --> 43:53.886
I have earned my reward
and my vengeance!

43:56.924 --> 43:58.991
Indeed, you have.

43:59.026 --> 44:00.960
And all shall be as we agreed

44:00.994 --> 44:03.429
once you arrange this one last matter.

44:03.463 --> 44:05.298
One more?

44:05.332 --> 44:08.734
And then another and
another and another.

44:08.769 --> 44:12.138
I've served you because it
was to our mutual benefit.

44:12.172 --> 44:15.641
But you make me a pact here now.

44:15.676 --> 44:18.377
I will do one last errand for you,

44:18.412 --> 44:22.882
and you will deliver on
all your promises to me.

44:24.017 --> 44:25.351
And how shall we seal our pact?

44:25.385 --> 44:26.953
In blood.

44:52.312 --> 44:54.880
Now, what do you wish from me?

44:54.915 --> 44:59.418
As my father liked to say...

44:59.453 --> 45:03.422
"If your right hand offend thee,

45:03.457 --> 45:05.925
cut it off."

45:05.959 --> 45:07.359
Your right hand?

45:10.297 --> 45:11.793
Murder my brother.

45:12.062 --> 45:15.275
