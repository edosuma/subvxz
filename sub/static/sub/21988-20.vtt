00:06.633 --> 00:07.832
Baker 46, County.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.734
DISPATCHER:
Baker 46, go ahead.

00:09.736 --> 00:12.604
County, I'm in pursuit,
late model SUV, dark in color,

00:12.606 --> 00:14.572
heading westbound, S.R. 74.

00:14.574 --> 00:15.607
DISPATCHER:
Plates?

00:15.609 --> 00:16.841
Not close enough.

00:16.843 --> 00:18.543
(tires screeching)

00:18.545 --> 00:20.378
Vehicle turning north
toward Harrington Lake.

00:20.380 --> 00:23.281
Baker 46, my paperwork says
you are transporting a suspect.

00:23.283 --> 00:24.816
Slow down, damn it, slow down.

00:24.818 --> 00:26.451
You'll be fine.
No, I won't.

00:26.453 --> 00:28.887
DISPATCHER: Sheriff,
county codes don't allow

00:28.889 --> 00:30.822
for pursuits with suspects
in transport.

00:30.824 --> 00:33.525
Screw the codes, County. This
guy's weaving all over the road.

00:33.527 --> 00:35.126
He's gonna kill somebody.

00:36.596 --> 00:39.164
- Sheriff! Please!
- Shut up, Billings!

00:43.970 --> 00:45.970
Annie.

00:45.972 --> 00:48.039
Scrambled or over easy?

00:48.041 --> 00:50.408
Ugh, I'm never camping
with you again.

00:50.410 --> 00:53.478
Come on, sis, that's just
your stomach talking.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.114
It's too early,
and I didn't get much sleep.

00:56.116 --> 00:57.849
You don't want to
miss the sunrise.

00:57.851 --> 01:00.852
(siren approaching)

01:02.556 --> 01:04.055
Annie, look out!

01:07.694 --> 01:09.227
Oh!

01:09.229 --> 01:11.095
Trevor, go help!

01:13.533 --> 01:16.201
Annie, stop!
Let me go.

MAN:
Hey.

01:35.021 --> 01:37.722
Hey, are you all right?

01:37.724 --> 01:39.591
SHERIFF:
There's another guy.

01:39.593 --> 01:41.793
In the car.

01:44.598 --> 01:46.464
Oh, my God.

02:24.418 --> 02:25.805
The twins are going
through so many clothes,

02:25.806 --> 02:26.615
I can't even tell you.

02:26.616 --> 02:27.915
Yeah, happy to help.

02:27.917 --> 02:29.817
Baby Morgan can have all
of Victoria's hand-me-downs.

02:29.819 --> 02:30.985
Hey, Torres, look.

02:30.987 --> 02:33.421
I finally found a T-shirt
small enough for you.

02:33.423 --> 02:35.490
Oh, they make humans that tiny?

02:35.492 --> 02:36.657
Oh, that was
Victoria's favorite.

02:36.659 --> 02:38.659
I remember one time
she puked all over it.

02:38.661 --> 02:41.662
She refused
to take it off.

02:41.664 --> 02:43.331
Oh, thank you.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.133
Well, I just wanted
to say thanks again.

02:45.135 --> 02:47.668
Yeah. He's right here.
You want to talk to him?

02:47.670 --> 02:49.203
Okay, I will. Bye.

02:49.205 --> 02:50.938
Well, Thomas Buckner
says, "Yo, yo."

02:50.940 --> 02:52.173
Commander Buckner.

02:52.175 --> 02:53.941
Tell him I said, "Yo, yo" back.

02:53.943 --> 02:55.476
Yeah, you see I'm
off the phone, right?

02:55.478 --> 02:57.178
Thomas Buckner? Do I know him?

02:57.180 --> 02:59.280
Uh, he is my archenemy
from high school,

02:59.282 --> 03:02.917
and we, like, randomly
ran into him on a case

03:02.919 --> 03:06.154
and, of course,
he and Torres hit it off.

03:06.156 --> 03:07.822
Yeah, he's coming
to D.C. soon.

03:07.824 --> 03:11.259
He said he'd give me a call and,
uh, we're gonna hit the town.

03:11.261 --> 03:12.827
Oh, he's already here.
He actually leaves today.

03:12.829 --> 03:14.629
What? Why didn't he call me?

03:14.631 --> 03:17.598
I don't know. He called me.
We went out last night.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.801
Hold on one second. The...
(chuckles)

03:19.803 --> 03:22.904
Okay. The two of you
went out last night?

03:22.906 --> 03:25.473
Not out-out. We're just friends.

03:25.475 --> 03:27.608
Wait, you're friends with
your archenemy from high school?

03:27.610 --> 03:30.044
People change, McGee,
and, I don't know,

03:30.046 --> 03:32.446
Torres told me to give him
another chance, so I did.

03:32.448 --> 03:34.182
Yeah, but I didn't say
date the guy.

03:34.184 --> 03:36.851
It was not a date.

03:36.853 --> 03:39.487
Where'd you go?
To that new bar on Second.

03:39.489 --> 03:41.789
Just for drinks?
We had dinner, too.

03:41.791 --> 03:44.525
Who paid?
He paid.

03:44.527 --> 03:46.661
Sounds like a date to me.
Boom!

03:46.663 --> 03:49.797
Yo, yo, grab your gear, bro.

03:49.799 --> 03:52.700
(camera clicking)

03:52.702 --> 03:54.702
(gears cranking)

03:54.704 --> 03:56.070
Hey, Bishop,

03:56.072 --> 03:58.072
you mind helping me
transfer the body

03:58.074 --> 03:59.841
from the back seat
to the gurney?

03:59.843 --> 04:00.942
Oh. Just what a lady

04:00.944 --> 04:03.344
wants to hear first
thing in the morning.

04:03.346 --> 04:04.779
What an awful way to go.

04:04.781 --> 04:06.147
Alone and handcuffed

04:06.149 --> 04:08.816
as lake water slowly
fills the locked cage

04:08.818 --> 04:10.351
that soon becomes
your coffin.

04:10.353 --> 04:11.853
Stop talking now, Jimmy.

04:11.855 --> 04:13.888
- Yeah, that got dark quick.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.690
McGEE: Paramedics say
you're gonna be fine.

04:15.692 --> 04:19.392
Sheriff, is there anything I can
get you? Make a phone call?

04:19.394 --> 04:21.629
We sank so fast.

04:21.630 --> 04:24.065
Can you tell me more
about the accident?

04:24.067 --> 04:26.400
Tried to get him out.

04:26.402 --> 04:30.738
The door...
I couldn't get it open.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.406
Boss, this is
Sheriff Pearson.

04:32.408 --> 04:36.577
He executed an arrest warrant on
Petty Officer Thomas Billings.

04:36.579 --> 04:38.813
He was transporting him
to Breen County Jail.

04:38.815 --> 04:40.548
That's when
the accident happened.

04:40.550 --> 04:41.949
You okay?

04:42.919 --> 04:44.385
How'd you end up in the lake?

04:44.387 --> 04:45.987
Pursuing a three-five-seven.
Drunk driver?

04:45.989 --> 04:49.457
Speeding and swerving
all over the road.

04:49.459 --> 04:52.059
I tried to catch up
to him, but...

04:52.061 --> 04:53.794
I lost control.

04:54.864 --> 04:57.198
So, he comes
barreling through here,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.400
pulls a <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i>
right into the lake.

04:59.402 --> 05:00.568
Craziest thing.

05:00.570 --> 05:02.069
You jump in
after them?

05:02.071 --> 05:04.438
My sister tried,
but I stopped her.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.475
There was a guy in a boat
right out there to help.

05:07.477 --> 05:09.610
Is the sheriff
gonna be okay?

05:09.612 --> 05:11.979
Uh, he got lucky.

05:11.981 --> 05:14.048
Well, guess I'm not
going fishing today.

05:14.050 --> 05:16.450
Okay, draft the new language,
then shoot it over to me,

05:16.452 --> 05:18.819
and I'll red-line it before
I get back in the office.

05:18.821 --> 05:21.289
All right, Stan,
I got to go.

05:21.291 --> 05:22.790
Annie Barth?
That's me.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.959
How you doing?
Special Agent Nick Torres, NCIS.

05:24.961 --> 05:27.662
Nice to meet you.

05:27.664 --> 05:29.397
Okay, nice to meet you.
(clears throat)

05:29.399 --> 05:32.266
Uh, I understand
you swam out for help?

05:32.268 --> 05:35.002
I tried.
My brother held me back.

05:35.004 --> 05:37.171
He said something about a man
in a boat, a fisherman maybe,

05:37.173 --> 05:39.040
who saw the crash.
Yes, I heard him shout,

05:39.042 --> 05:41.108
asking the sheriff
if he was all right.

05:41.110 --> 05:42.443
We haven't been able
to track him down.

05:42.445 --> 05:43.878
Did you see what he looked like?
(chuckles)

05:43.880 --> 05:47.114
I have no idea.
I'm blind, Agent Torres.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.085
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

05:51.087 --> 05:52.320
Why?

05:52.322 --> 05:54.021
No, I just, uh, didn't...

05:54.023 --> 05:57.291
Wait, why did you try
to jump in the lake?

05:57.293 --> 06:00.494
To try to save someone's life.
Blind people can swim, you know.

06:00.496 --> 06:00.997
Of course.

06:01.021 --> 06:03.021
We can cut our own meat
and feed ourselves, too.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.966
Okay. (chuckles)
All right, I'm sorry--

06:04.968 --> 06:07.201
uh, I apologize
we wasted your time.

06:07.203 --> 06:09.136
You can stop apologizing.

06:10.506 --> 06:12.039
Okay, thank you.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.874
(clears throat)

06:22.452 --> 06:24.819
My work here is done.

06:24.821 --> 06:26.721
TORRES:
Why is Jimmy leaving?

06:26.723 --> 06:30.558
Well, go look for yourself.

06:31.828 --> 06:34.028
TORRES:
Uh, where's the body?

06:47.250 --> 06:48.883
(clears throat)

06:48.885 --> 06:50.851
Talked to Buckner.

06:50.853 --> 06:53.721
He said he, uh,
catch me next time.

06:53.723 --> 06:55.156
Hmm. That's nice.

06:55.158 --> 06:57.625
I just can't believe
you two went out

06:57.627 --> 06:59.393
and didn't even think
of calling me.

06:59.395 --> 07:01.962
Well, I never
think to call you.

07:02.698 --> 07:04.298
All right, well, that's rude.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.466
Torres, you jealous?

07:05.468 --> 07:06.834
Yes, absolutely,
because, you know,

07:06.836 --> 07:09.770
like, he's, like,
my friend, not hers.

07:09.772 --> 07:11.172
Okay, where are we?

07:11.174 --> 07:13.908
Well...

07:13.910 --> 07:15.843
Petty Officer
Thomas Billings.

07:15.845 --> 07:18.812
Gunner's mate second class,
assigned to the USS <i>Spruce Hill.</i>

07:18.814 --> 07:20.915
McGEE: Our two witnesses
didn't see or hear

07:20.917 --> 07:22.550
Billings come up from
the bottom of the lake.

07:22.552 --> 07:24.552
Navy divers are searching
for his body now.

07:24.554 --> 07:26.887
We set up checkpoints,
in case he did escape.

07:26.889 --> 07:27.888
What do we know about him?

07:27.890 --> 07:29.823
McGEE: Single, 24,
social media page

07:29.825 --> 07:33.694
says he's engaged to Louise
Cabrisio of Hastings, Virginia.

07:33.696 --> 07:35.596
TORRES: That's where, uh,
Billings has an apartment.

07:35.598 --> 07:36.897
I spoke with the landlord.

07:36.899 --> 07:38.766
He said he'd let me in.
Yeah, go.

07:38.768 --> 07:40.434
Bishop, go talk
to his C.O.

07:40.436 --> 07:41.869
Billings have a record?

07:41.871 --> 07:43.637
Uh, not until yesterday,
when an arrest warrant

07:43.639 --> 07:45.272
was issued for a felony assault.

07:45.274 --> 07:47.541
PEARSON:
Agents Gibbs and McGee.

07:47.543 --> 07:49.043
Find our man?

07:49.045 --> 07:50.411
Sheriff Pearson.

07:50.413 --> 07:53.080
Thanks for coming in.
No. No word yet.

07:53.082 --> 07:55.115
Uh, Sheriff,
we just have a few questions.

07:55.117 --> 07:56.517
The drunk driver
you were chasing--

07:56.519 --> 07:57.985
did you get a plate number?

07:57.987 --> 08:00.521
Never got close enough.
Dark SUV, that's all I know.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.089
I got my deputies all over it.

08:02.091 --> 08:03.357
What can you tell us
about the guy in the boat?

08:03.359 --> 08:04.692
(scoffs)
What a jackass.

08:04.694 --> 08:07.061
Asks me if I'm all right,
then motors off.

08:07.063 --> 08:08.495
Well, county dispatch sent over

08:08.497 --> 08:10.764
the audio recording
of the pursuit.

08:10.766 --> 08:12.700
Petty Officer Billings
asked you a question

08:12.702 --> 08:14.335
that we caught on tape.

08:14.337 --> 08:16.103
We isolated his voice.

08:16.105 --> 08:18.472
BILLINGS (recorded):
Is this about Randall Peters?

08:18.474 --> 08:20.808
Is this about Randall... who?

08:20.810 --> 08:22.443
Peters? Who is he?

08:22.445 --> 08:24.511
Well, we thought he was
the guy Billings assaulted.

08:24.513 --> 08:27.281
No. No, his name
is, uh, Nordstrom.

08:27.283 --> 08:29.083
Billings beat him so bad,
knocked a tooth out.

08:29.085 --> 08:30.884
You can talk to him,
if you want to.

08:30.886 --> 08:33.654
Oh, yeah. We will.

08:33.655 --> 08:35.356
Got something.

08:35.357 --> 08:37.224
(sighs)
Not yet.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.460
Actually, I was telling you
that I've got something.

08:39.462 --> 08:40.894
Oh. 'Cause sometimes
I can't tell

08:40.895 --> 08:42.395
if you're asking
me a question.

08:42.398 --> 08:43.831
Was that a question?

08:43.832 --> 08:45.366
Just tell me.
So the divers

08:45.368 --> 08:47.334
didn't find Petty Officer
Billings at the bottom

08:47.336 --> 08:49.803
of the lake, but they did find
some of his personal effects

08:49.805 --> 08:51.805
taken by the sheriff,
including a cell phone.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.742
If only someone could
get it working again.

08:54.744 --> 08:56.777
Hmm.

08:56.779 --> 08:58.946
If only.

08:59.615 --> 09:00.748
Thank you.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.249
Wait, wait, wait.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.784
Uh, this box is for you.

09:03.786 --> 09:05.486
You wanted donations
for your charity?

09:05.488 --> 09:08.255
Oh, right. Good on you, Abby.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.524
It's just some clothes
and toys for kids.

09:10.526 --> 09:12.726
This is...

09:12.728 --> 09:14.895
for a child?
(giggles) Hug me.

09:14.897 --> 09:16.497
Yeah, that's Winifred.

09:16.499 --> 09:19.066
I used to sleep with her
when I was little.

09:19.068 --> 09:21.368
Explains a lot.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.606
Thanks.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.107
Bye, Winnie.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.543
You'll be in good hands.

09:29.545 --> 09:31.445
ODWALLA:
<i>Here's the warrant authorizing</i>

09:31.447 --> 09:33.747
Petty Officer Billings' arrest
for assault.

09:33.749 --> 09:38.085
Signed by a judge and NCIS, so a
delivery agreement was executed.

09:38.087 --> 09:40.254
Did Billings say anything
when the sheriff picked him up?

09:40.256 --> 09:43.123
Yeah. That he didn't do it.
Don't they all?

09:43.125 --> 09:45.125
Well, sometimes
they're innocent.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.427
I don't think so.

09:46.429 --> 09:47.628
Why do you say that?

09:47.630 --> 09:48.896
He was an
undisciplined sailor.

09:48.898 --> 09:50.564
Disorderly bunk, out of uniform,

09:50.566 --> 09:52.199
consistently late to muster.

09:52.201 --> 09:54.401
Anything else?

09:56.639 --> 09:59.306
Over the past six months,
we've had some misappropriations

09:59.308 --> 10:00.874
from the ship's armory.

10:00.876 --> 10:02.643
Someone stole weapons?
That's the weird part.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.045
Small arms, ammo,
it's all accounted for.

10:05.047 --> 10:07.114
So what went missing?

10:07.116 --> 10:08.949
Smoke grenades and flare guns.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.718
Low priority items,

10:10.720 --> 10:13.320
which is why we didn't catch
the theft right away.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.822
Well, as a gunner's mate
second class,

10:14.824 --> 10:17.291
Billings had access
to the armory.

10:17.293 --> 10:19.626
He was our number one suspect.
Why didn't you call in NCIS?

10:19.628 --> 10:22.262
We were about to.
But now there's no need.

10:22.264 --> 10:24.131
He got picked up
for another crime,

10:24.133 --> 10:26.100
and he is not
the Navy's problem anymore.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.703
(bell jingles)

10:33.142 --> 10:35.609
And how can I help
you gentlemen?

10:35.611 --> 10:39.313
NCIS. We're here to speak
with Louise Cabrisio.

10:39.315 --> 10:40.681
I'm her father.
What's this about?

10:40.683 --> 10:42.149
REEVES:
Her fiancé,

10:42.151 --> 10:44.118
Thomas Billings,
he's been in an accident.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.186
Tom? Is he okay?

10:46.188 --> 10:48.222
McGEE: Well, that's unclear.
(sniffling softly)

10:48.224 --> 10:49.890
FRED: Oh, my
God, you know.

10:49.892 --> 10:51.458
Louise, I'm so sorry.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.626
What?

10:52.628 --> 10:55.462
Uh... how do you know?

10:55.464 --> 10:58.932
These agents just told me
that Tom was in an accident.

10:58.934 --> 11:02.136
What accident?
Tom was in an accident?

11:02.138 --> 11:06.039
Yes. Sorry, uh, we thought
that's why you were crying.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.443
No. Um, he just
broke up with me.

11:09.445 --> 11:10.677
REEVES:
Just?

11:10.679 --> 11:12.613
How "just"?
You spoke with him?

11:12.615 --> 11:14.848
Five minutes ago.
REEVES: Did he say

11:14.850 --> 11:15.816
where was he calling from?

11:15.818 --> 11:17.851
His apartment.
Someone please tell me

11:17.853 --> 11:19.720
what's going on.
(dialing, line ringing)

11:19.722 --> 11:21.455
TORRES: McGee.
Torres, heads up.

11:21.457 --> 11:23.323
Billings is alive,
and he's at his apartment.

11:23.325 --> 11:24.491
Got it.

11:36.505 --> 11:38.839
(knocking on door)

11:38.841 --> 11:40.340
TORRES:
Petty Officer Billings.

11:40.342 --> 11:42.176
It's NCIS.

11:42.178 --> 11:43.877
(knocking)

11:43.879 --> 11:46.013
Billings, I'm coming in.

11:59.061 --> 12:01.228
Hey, I don't know
what's going on with you, man...

12:03.032 --> 12:05.532
...but I'm here to help.

12:07.870 --> 12:10.137
♪ ♪

12:34.296 --> 12:36.563
♪ ♪

12:54.049 --> 12:56.250
(exhales)

13:08.248 --> 13:10.615
Well, those aren't
smoke grenades.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.707
No. Or flare guns.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.875
So he resold them,
and that's the profit?

13:14.877 --> 13:16.410
Nah, they're not
worth that much.

13:16.412 --> 13:18.545
How much is it?
It's 26,460.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.080
Wow.

13:20.082 --> 13:22.483
In Petty Officer
Billings' ceiling, huh?

13:22.485 --> 13:24.885
Now he's on the run.
Armed and dangerous.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.687
Okay. Theories?

13:27.356 --> 13:28.589
We track down
the drunk driver

13:28.591 --> 13:30.491
that, uh, Sheriff Pearson
was chasing?

13:30.493 --> 13:32.226
No. Or the witness
on the boat.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.927
What about the guy

13:33.929 --> 13:35.729
that Petty Officer Billings
was asking about?

13:35.731 --> 13:36.997
Randall Peters?

13:36.999 --> 13:38.766
There are five in
the tristate area,

13:38.768 --> 13:40.668
and about 137 in the U.S.

13:40.670 --> 13:42.703
But McGee and Bishop
are vetting each one,

13:42.705 --> 13:44.238
starting with
the locals.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.340
And Billings' assault victim,
Nordstrom?

13:46.342 --> 13:48.609
A janitor at a bowling alley.
No permanent address,

13:48.611 --> 13:50.444
but we're tracking him down.
(knock on door)

13:50.446 --> 13:52.079
Yeah?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.547
Hey.

13:53.549 --> 13:56.350
Um, one of the crash witnesses
just called.

13:56.352 --> 13:59.119
She says she has helpful
information to show us.

13:59.121 --> 14:00.421
Who?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.356
Annie Barth.
Got her address.

14:02.358 --> 14:04.325
Oh, I interviewed her
at the crime scene.

14:04.327 --> 14:05.959
She's got nothing.
GIBBS: Yeah?

14:05.961 --> 14:07.895
Well, we got nothing. Go.

14:07.897 --> 14:08.996
Gibbs.

14:08.998 --> 14:12.266
She's blind.

14:13.502 --> 14:14.935
What's she gonna show us?

14:14.937 --> 14:18.672
I don't know, Torres.
Go. Find out.

14:21.977 --> 14:24.144
(ice hissing, crackling)

14:29.151 --> 14:31.352
Oh, wow, it is
freezing in here.

14:31.354 --> 14:32.920
Cold air is dry air, McGee.
I'm trying to get

14:32.922 --> 14:34.922
all the moisture out
of this room. Shut the door.

14:37.193 --> 14:39.460
All right. You think
this is gonna work?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.961
(sighs)
I don't know.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.130
I mean, the phone was
submerged for six hours.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.732
What is the temperature
in here?

14:44.734 --> 14:46.266
It's 42 degrees.

14:46.268 --> 14:48.635
And I've got it down
to 18 percent humidity.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.270
You want some lip balm?

14:50.272 --> 14:51.438
No. I need a parka.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.674
Wait, don't you want
to see if this works?

14:53.676 --> 14:56.877
Well, if it doesn't,
we're risking frostbite.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.884
Abby, nice work.

15:03.886 --> 15:06.186
Oh, darn. It's locked.

15:06.188 --> 15:08.255
That's not what I wanted to see.

15:08.257 --> 15:10.791
You wouldn't just
happen to know

15:10.793 --> 15:13.026
Petty Officer Billing''
password, would you?

15:13.028 --> 15:15.229
Six digits, random order,

15:15.231 --> 15:17.798
that's a million
different combinations.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.000
Great.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.103
(doorbell rings)

15:23.105 --> 15:25.305
One minute.

15:28.611 --> 15:30.177
Who is it?

15:30.179 --> 15:33.180
TORRES: Ms. Barth, it's, uh,
Nick Torres, NCIS.

15:33.694 --> 15:35.227
Hi, Nick. Come on in.

15:35.229 --> 15:36.628
Thank you.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.897
It's not much,
but it's home.

15:38.899 --> 15:40.999
Oh, nice,
I wish I could see it.

15:41.001 --> 15:43.235
Oh, my gosh.
Harlan, turn on the lights.

15:43.237 --> 15:45.470
HARLAN (automated voice): Okay. Lights on.
- Forgive me.

15:45.472 --> 15:47.139
I often forget
to do that for guests.

15:47.141 --> 15:49.007
Oh. Oh, no problem.

15:49.009 --> 15:51.410
I'm assuming, uh, you don't
really need any lights.

15:51.412 --> 15:53.178
No. (exhales)

15:53.180 --> 15:55.914
Useless as pictures on the wall,
but I'm hanging them anyway.

15:55.916 --> 15:58.250
My friend gave me
this braille map of the U.S.

15:58.252 --> 15:59.751
It's pretty cool, right?

15:59.753 --> 16:01.920
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Let me help you with that.

16:01.922 --> 16:03.121
No, I got it.

16:03.123 --> 16:05.123
(grunts)

16:06.860 --> 16:08.126
TORRES:
Oh, wow.

16:08.128 --> 16:10.362
You're a lawyer?
Guilty.

16:16.370 --> 16:17.970
Ha.

16:17.972 --> 16:19.671
How's it look?

16:19.673 --> 16:22.407
Oh, it's actually perfect.

16:22.409 --> 16:24.910
That marble trick may be better
than eyeing it-- okay.

16:24.912 --> 16:26.211
Don't worry about it.

16:26.213 --> 16:28.080
I can hear the word "eye"
without crying.

16:28.082 --> 16:30.482
(clears throat) Uh, you said
you had some information

16:30.484 --> 16:32.617
that you thought would help us.

16:32.619 --> 16:33.852
I do. But it's not here.

16:33.854 --> 16:36.054
How would you like
to go on a field trip?

16:39.293 --> 16:41.326
SLOANE: Ms. Cabrisio,
thank you so...

16:41.328 --> 16:43.095
(man clears throat)

16:43.097 --> 16:45.564
Uh, I'm sorry.
Uh, who are you?

16:45.566 --> 16:47.466
Webber Silk.
Friend of the family.

16:47.468 --> 16:48.800
Nice to meet you, Agent Sloane.

16:48.802 --> 16:50.335
Special Agent Sloane.

16:50.337 --> 16:52.471
Uh, apologies,
but we don't allow friends.

16:52.473 --> 16:56.041
Oh, well, I am also
Ms. Cabrisio's attorney.

16:56.043 --> 16:57.409
So...

16:57.411 --> 16:59.544
No, thank you.

16:59.546 --> 17:02.447
Um, my dad's idea, sorry.

17:02.449 --> 17:04.449
He didn't know
what this was all about.

17:04.451 --> 17:06.117
Yes, better safe than sorry.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.286
I promise I won't
get in the way, Agent Sloane.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.021
Special Agent.

17:10.023 --> 17:11.623
As I was saying,
Ms. Cabrisio,

17:11.625 --> 17:13.224
thank you so much for coming in.

17:13.227 --> 17:14.992
Uh, just a
few questions.

17:14.994 --> 17:17.596
Has Petty Officer Billings
contacted you since yesterday?

17:17.598 --> 17:18.563
No.

17:18.565 --> 17:20.132
And when he called,

17:20.134 --> 17:21.967
what did he say, exactly?

17:21.969 --> 17:24.970
Uh, that he loved me
very much.

17:24.972 --> 17:27.906
But that something bad
had happened,

17:27.907 --> 17:32.110
and that he and I couldn't...

17:32.112 --> 17:33.578
I'm sorry.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.848
We went to his
apartment and found

17:36.850 --> 17:39.818
over $25,000 in cash there.

17:42.523 --> 17:44.456
I take it you didn't
know about that.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.625
25,000?

17:46.627 --> 17:48.293
Uh...

17:48.295 --> 17:51.196
I've never seen him
with anything more than $25.

17:51.198 --> 17:53.799
Right.

17:53.801 --> 17:56.701
Do you know someone named
Randall Peters?

17:56.703 --> 17:58.270
Tom's business partner.

17:58.272 --> 17:59.504
What business?

17:59.506 --> 18:01.540
I don't know.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.042
Tom said it would be better
if I didn't ask.

18:04.044 --> 18:07.345
Okay. And how would
we reach Mr. Peters?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.881
Objection, badgering
the witness. Sustained.

18:09.883 --> 18:11.116
Hmm?

18:11.118 --> 18:12.551
LOUISE:
Webber, I'm-I'm fine.

18:12.553 --> 18:14.786
I never met Peters.

18:14.788 --> 18:16.288
He and Tom worked together.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.790
I used to see the reminder
on his phone calendar.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.326
Uh, so do you know
where they would meet?

18:21.328 --> 18:23.328
No.

18:23.330 --> 18:25.063
No.
But Tom did say,

18:25.065 --> 18:26.698
last week,
that it would be the last time

18:26.700 --> 18:27.833
they would ever see each other.

18:27.835 --> 18:29.201
Why? What happened?

18:29.203 --> 18:31.570
I'm sorry.

18:31.572 --> 18:33.905
I feel so dumb for not
asking him more questions.

18:33.907 --> 18:35.440
That's okay.

18:35.442 --> 18:38.510
We have Tom's cell phone,
and we need to get in.

18:38.512 --> 18:39.945
What-what would the password be?

18:39.947 --> 18:41.513
Why did you want to get
into his cell phone?

18:41.515 --> 18:44.049
Come on, dude, seriously?

18:44.051 --> 18:46.718
(exhales)

18:46.720 --> 18:48.520
Uh, the password.

18:50.524 --> 18:52.224
Well, how many chances
do we get?

18:52.226 --> 18:53.458
Ten.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.026
Okay. How many guesses
have we made?

18:55.028 --> 18:56.695
Eight.

18:56.697 --> 19:00.665
Um, like, his birthday,
his parents' anniversary,

19:00.667 --> 19:03.101
first six numbers
of his Social,

19:03.103 --> 19:05.370
the last six numbers
of his Social.

19:05.372 --> 19:07.572
And what if you get it
wrong twice more?

19:07.574 --> 19:10.342
Then the phone's gonna revert
back to its factory settings.

19:10.344 --> 19:13.311
And that means
that-that all texts

19:13.313 --> 19:17.382
and e-mails and contact lists,
everything will be gone forever.

19:17.384 --> 19:19.651
Well, have you
tried 1-2-3-4-5-6?

19:19.653 --> 19:21.153
No, nobody's that foolish.

19:21.155 --> 19:22.854
(quietly):
Except for me.

19:22.856 --> 19:25.090
Hey, I got it.
I got the password.

19:25.092 --> 19:27.492
Thank God, 'cause we were about
to do something really stupid.

19:27.494 --> 19:28.927
SLOANE:
Okay.

19:28.929 --> 19:29.728
5-6-8-4-7-3.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.329
Random digits?
Nope.

19:31.331 --> 19:33.298
It spells "Louise,"
his fiancée's name.

19:35.202 --> 19:37.802
Okay, guys, here we go.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.308
Incorrect password.
Try again.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.910
SLOANE: No.
Louise lied to you.

19:44.912 --> 19:47.045
Or Billings changed it.
To what?

19:47.047 --> 19:48.947
We've got one more chance
here before this thing

19:48.949 --> 19:50.315
turns into a brick.

19:50.317 --> 19:51.883
(phone chirps)

19:51.885 --> 19:55.287
Wait, what did you do there?
I... I did nothing.

19:55.289 --> 19:57.155
It's a calendar alert.

19:57.157 --> 19:59.758
"Randall Peters
pickup, 6:30."

19:59.760 --> 20:01.560
Who is Randall Peters?

20:01.562 --> 20:04.029
Abby, we really, really need
to get into this phone.

20:05.065 --> 20:06.965
It's rod-cone dystrophy.

20:06.967 --> 20:10.735
It's degenerative
and hereditary.

20:10.737 --> 20:12.904
Thanks, Mom.
(chuckles)

20:12.906 --> 20:15.607
Can I ask you a question?
Mm-hmm.

20:15.609 --> 20:19.177
Can you... can
you see anything?

20:19.179 --> 20:22.847
Um, shapes and shadows,
light and dark.

20:22.849 --> 20:25.016
Hmm, okay. We need to stop.
There's some uneven terrain.

20:25.018 --> 20:26.785
I need a guide here
for this part.

20:26.787 --> 20:28.353
Okay, no problem.

20:28.355 --> 20:31.356
Wait, no, no, don't pull me.
Just give me your arm.

20:31.358 --> 20:33.258
Yeah, there you go.
You have it.

20:33.260 --> 20:34.492
Okay, I'm sorry.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.094
There you go, apologizing.

20:36.096 --> 20:37.963
Right, right.
I don't even apologize.

20:37.965 --> 20:41.066
I don't know why
I'm doing it now.

20:41.068 --> 20:44.269
I think we're here.

20:44.271 --> 20:45.870
Really? How do we know?

20:45.872 --> 20:48.006
I smell bacon grease.

20:48.008 --> 20:50.141
My brother must've dumped it
in the, in the pit,

20:50.143 --> 20:51.876
even though
I've told him so many times

20:51.878 --> 20:53.878
it's bad for the environment.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.315
Wait, so when
one sense goes away,

20:57.317 --> 20:58.817
the other ones improve?

20:58.819 --> 21:00.118
Uh, not exactly.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.887
It's not that I smell
any better.

21:02.889 --> 21:05.190
It's more like,
I pay more attention.

21:05.192 --> 21:07.559
So you try it.
Close your eyes.

21:07.561 --> 21:09.227
- No, I'm cool.
- No, no.

21:09.229 --> 21:13.031
This is actually
why we're here, so...

21:14.901 --> 21:16.334
Yeah.

21:16.336 --> 21:18.336
Okay, stop.

21:18.338 --> 21:20.538
Now close your eyes.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.307
Okay, they're closed.

21:22.309 --> 21:23.775
Don't lie to me.

21:23.777 --> 21:25.677
Fine!
(chuckles)

21:25.679 --> 21:29.347
Now listen.
What do you hear?

21:29.349 --> 21:31.850
Um... birds.

21:31.852 --> 21:34.686
- Okay. What else?
- Uh...

21:34.688 --> 21:36.588
Come on, Nick, really listen.
What do you hear?

21:36.590 --> 21:38.056
Okay, okay. Stop talking.

21:38.058 --> 21:39.291
(chuckles softly)

21:39.293 --> 21:43.595
I hear, uh, a duck
landing in the water.

21:43.597 --> 21:45.930
Mm-hmm. What else?
Um...

21:45.932 --> 21:48.199
A car on the road.

21:48.201 --> 21:49.834
(passing car rattles on road)

21:49.836 --> 21:51.069
Th-Thunk.

21:51.071 --> 21:53.104
Th-Thunk.

21:53.106 --> 21:54.806
Every time
a car passes by,

21:54.808 --> 21:58.043
it makes the same noise.
Th-Thunk.

21:59.046 --> 22:02.213
Yeah, there's some kind
of grate on the road.

22:02.215 --> 22:04.783
We, uh, we passed over it
on the way in.

22:04.785 --> 22:08.286
Yeah, yesterday morning,
I heard the cop car

22:08.288 --> 22:10.789
go over that grate before
it splashed into the water.

22:10.791 --> 22:13.158
But I only heard
one "Th-thunk."

22:15.028 --> 22:16.494
So?

22:16.496 --> 22:19.698
So... where was
the drunk driver?

22:19.700 --> 22:22.534
My brother told me the sheriff
was chasing a drunk driver,

22:22.536 --> 22:24.336
but I didn't hear
a second "Th-thunk."

22:24.338 --> 22:26.071
Maybe you missed it.

22:26.073 --> 22:28.073
Maybe you're wearing
too much cologne.

22:28.075 --> 22:30.508
Come on, Annie, stop playing.
This is important.

22:30.510 --> 22:32.477
Could you have missed
a second "thunk"?

22:32.479 --> 22:34.713
Could you be wearing too much
cologne, Agent Torres?

22:34.715 --> 22:36.348
No, that is impossible.

22:36.350 --> 22:37.515
Exactly.

22:40.387 --> 22:43.822
Of course she didn't see
the other car. She's blind.

22:43.824 --> 22:46.257
She can hear. Perfectly.

22:46.259 --> 22:47.959
She didn't hear
a second "Th-thunk"?

22:47.961 --> 22:49.694
You got to be kidding me.

22:49.696 --> 22:51.429
Not kidding.

22:51.431 --> 22:52.997
So, what, I was
chasing a ghost?

22:52.999 --> 22:54.666
Or nobody at all.

22:54.668 --> 22:56.101
You're gonna believe
Helen Keller and not me?

22:56.103 --> 22:57.802
We checked.
No other commuter

22:57.804 --> 22:59.771
on Route 74 called 911

22:59.773 --> 23:01.773
to report a drunk driver
that morning.

23:01.775 --> 23:04.376
It was early.
No one was on the road.

23:05.379 --> 23:08.279
This is BS.
I'm the victim here.

23:08.281 --> 23:10.515
Petty Officer Billings
is the victim.

23:10.517 --> 23:12.317
Come on.

23:12.319 --> 23:14.753
You think I would drive
into that lake on purpose?

23:14.755 --> 23:16.154
Great way to kill somebody.

23:17.357 --> 23:19.357
What?

23:19.359 --> 23:20.392
He's not even dead.

23:20.394 --> 23:21.693
You know what?

23:21.695 --> 23:23.528
I don't need
to defend myself to you.

23:23.530 --> 23:24.629
Actually, you do.

23:24.631 --> 23:27.399
Do I need a lawyer?

23:27.401 --> 23:29.367
I don't know, do you?

23:29.369 --> 23:31.069
(gunshot)

23:32.806 --> 23:34.339
Bishop?

23:34.341 --> 23:35.807
Yeah, I'm okay.

23:35.809 --> 23:37.041
Pearson?

23:37.043 --> 23:39.344
Pearson?

23:58.447 --> 24:00.480
(elevator bell dings)

24:01.113 --> 24:03.180
- Morning. - Ah.
- You okay?

24:03.182 --> 24:04.781
Yeah. Thanks.

24:04.783 --> 24:06.149
How's Gibbs?

24:06.151 --> 24:07.784
Oh, Gibbs is Gibbs.

24:07.786 --> 24:09.119
And the shooter?

24:09.121 --> 24:11.455
We couldn't find him.

24:11.457 --> 24:13.056
You think it was
Petty Officer Billings?

24:13.058 --> 24:14.758
Makes sense.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.293
If Sheriff Pearson

24:16.295 --> 24:18.695
tried to drown him and make it
look like an accident,

24:18.697 --> 24:20.130
then yeah.

24:20.132 --> 24:21.565
Yeah, but why would he do that?

24:23.635 --> 24:25.535
Billings' assault victim,
Nordstrom.

24:25.537 --> 24:27.104
We find him yet?
This morning.

24:27.106 --> 24:29.039
He's coming in later
to talk to Sloane,

24:29.041 --> 24:31.007
who's also backgrounding
the sheriff.

24:31.009 --> 24:33.577
So, looks like
we're back to square one.

24:37.049 --> 24:39.316
(elevator bell dings)

24:39.318 --> 24:41.551
- Gibbs.
- Palmer. What do you know?

24:41.553 --> 24:43.520
GSW to the chest.

24:43.522 --> 24:46.490
Yeah, I saw that part.
You recover the slug?

24:46.492 --> 24:48.425
You know what's weird about
the abbreviation "GSW"?

24:48.427 --> 24:50.127
It actually takes
longer to say

24:50.129 --> 24:51.761
than the words
that it stands for.

24:51.763 --> 24:55.332
"GSW," five syllables.
"Gunshot wound," three.

24:55.334 --> 24:57.334
(chuckles)
Acronyms are weird.

24:57.336 --> 24:59.870
The slug. ASAP.

24:59.872 --> 25:01.271
On it, PDQ.

25:01.273 --> 25:03.907
As you can see,
the bullet is lodged

25:03.909 --> 25:06.076
in the tricuspid valve
of the heart.

25:06.078 --> 25:08.445
And while it is
pretty torn up,

25:08.447 --> 25:11.848
I wouldn't say that
that came from a handgun.

25:11.850 --> 25:13.150
The only weapon registered
to Petty Officer Billings

25:13.152 --> 25:14.217
is a Glock.

25:14.219 --> 25:15.418
So he's not our shooter.

25:15.420 --> 25:17.020
Or he could have
a second weapon.

25:17.022 --> 25:18.989
And one more thing, Gibbs.

25:18.991 --> 25:21.491
Uh, we found a dark substance
on the sheriff's pant leg.

25:21.493 --> 25:23.527
Abby's testing his clothes
as we speak.

25:26.732 --> 25:29.232
Dentist said he could
fix it for 800 bucks.

25:29.234 --> 25:32.802
I said, "Go fly a kite,"
or something similar.

25:32.804 --> 25:34.571
So I got this two-millimeter
drill bit

25:34.573 --> 25:37.741
and bore a hole
right through it.

25:37.743 --> 25:39.976
Now it's my lucky medallion.

25:39.978 --> 25:41.144
Charming.

25:41.146 --> 25:44.581
Okay, so,
Mr. Nordstrom...

25:44.583 --> 25:45.849
That's dental floss
for the chain.

25:45.851 --> 25:49.119
(chuckles):
I see that.

25:49.121 --> 25:50.854
Okay, you told Sheriff Pearson

25:50.856 --> 25:52.756
that Petty Officer Billings
assaulted you.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.292
Correct?
Yeah.

25:55.294 --> 25:58.128
Smoking in here is cool?
Mm, not cool.

25:58.130 --> 26:00.197
How did the attack happen?

26:00.199 --> 26:02.566
Could open those windows.

26:02.568 --> 26:04.467
Sheriff Pearson's report says

26:04.469 --> 26:06.503
you were closing up
the bowling alley,

26:06.505 --> 26:08.004
and Billings came at you.

26:08.006 --> 26:09.940
Yeah.

26:09.942 --> 26:12.008
And?

26:12.010 --> 26:14.177
And look at me.

26:14.179 --> 26:16.479
Well, why did he attack you?

26:16.481 --> 26:18.415
I don't know.

26:18.417 --> 26:20.350
Did he rob you?

26:22.421 --> 26:23.720
Uh, what does that mean?

26:23.722 --> 26:25.222
No.

26:25.224 --> 26:28.024
Did you guys know each other?

26:28.026 --> 26:30.126
No.

26:30.128 --> 26:32.262
Then how did you identify him?

26:32.264 --> 26:34.531
Look...

26:41.640 --> 26:43.840
Which one is Billings?

26:49.681 --> 26:52.082
Sir, someone obviously
beat the crap out of you,

26:52.084 --> 26:53.917
but I don't think
it was Billings.

26:53.919 --> 26:57.454
But you know who liked
to beat people up?

26:57.456 --> 26:59.556
Sheriff Pearson.

26:59.558 --> 27:02.459
I count four complaints
of excessive force

27:02.461 --> 27:03.927
in his personnel file.

27:03.929 --> 27:06.329
You and the sheriff
go way back.

27:06.331 --> 27:07.998
He's arrested you

27:08.000 --> 27:10.066
three times in the past
for possession.

27:10.068 --> 27:12.902
I don't want to go to jail.
Well, here's what I think.

27:12.904 --> 27:14.804
You got in trouble again,

27:14.806 --> 27:17.140
and Sheriff Pearson
made you a deal.

27:17.142 --> 27:20.277
He wouldn't arrest you
if you agreed to

27:20.279 --> 27:24.114
let him beat you up and claim
that Billings assaulted you.

27:24.116 --> 27:26.483
(grunting)

27:33.292 --> 27:35.525
Can I have that smoke now?

27:35.527 --> 27:37.527
BISHOP:
So, Sheriff Pearson

27:37.529 --> 27:40.697
falsifies a warrant
to arrest Billings.

27:40.699 --> 27:42.599
He handcuffs him and
locks him in the back seat.

27:42.601 --> 27:45.068
Then he pretends
there's a drunk driver,

27:45.070 --> 27:48.004
so he can drive into the lake
to try to drown Billings.

27:48.006 --> 27:49.739
But he didn't die.

27:49.741 --> 27:52.208
- So he comes back and kills Pearson.
- Why?

27:52.210 --> 27:53.943
There any evidence
they knew each other?

27:53.945 --> 27:56.479
No calls, no e-mails,
no mutual friends.

27:56.481 --> 27:59.182
But they did live
in the same small town.

27:59.184 --> 28:02.786
So did 3,000 other people.
What's their connection?

28:02.788 --> 28:05.355
Got something.
Abby I.D.'d the powder

28:05.357 --> 28:06.956
found on
Sheriff Pearson's pants.

28:06.958 --> 28:08.325
It's red phosphorous.

28:08.327 --> 28:10.727
Isn't that the stuff
at the tip of matches?

28:10.729 --> 28:12.162
Yeah, same chemical
that's found in flare guns

28:12.164 --> 28:13.630
and smoke grenades.

28:13.632 --> 28:15.532
- Just like the ones Billings stole.
BISHOP: That's it.

28:15.534 --> 28:16.533
That's the connection
between

28:16.535 --> 28:18.168
the petty officer
and the sheriff.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.837
Still doesn't explain
where the $26,000 came from.

28:20.839 --> 28:22.272
We're missing something.

28:22.274 --> 28:24.474
Where are we
with Randall Peters?

28:24.476 --> 28:26.476
Nowhere yet.
And Billings' phone?

28:26.478 --> 28:27.977
We're down to
the final password,

28:27.979 --> 28:29.479
but Abby's got an idea.

28:33.318 --> 28:34.584
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

28:34.586 --> 28:37.020
Jimmy, come on.
It's really hot.

28:37.022 --> 28:38.788
Someone's never played
with candle wax before.

28:38.790 --> 28:41.191
I have a very tender epidermis.

28:41.193 --> 28:42.659
ABBY:
Just hold still, okay?

28:42.661 --> 28:44.961
We're gonna bypass
the phone's biometric scanner

28:44.963 --> 28:47.797
by using hot wax
and a high-resolution image

28:47.799 --> 28:49.933
of Petty Officer Billings'
thumbprint.

28:49.935 --> 28:51.434
Yeah? Why can't Reeves do it?
Sorry, mate.

28:51.436 --> 28:53.570
Big thumbs.

28:53.572 --> 28:55.338
What if this doesn't work?

28:55.340 --> 28:56.740
It has to work.

29:05.450 --> 29:07.717
(phone beeps)

29:07.719 --> 29:09.052
ABBY:
Eureka.

29:09.054 --> 29:10.653
Yes!

29:11.923 --> 29:13.022
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

29:13.024 --> 29:14.257
We're in.

29:14.259 --> 29:15.725
GIBBS: You have contact
information for Randall Peters?

29:15.727 --> 29:18.328
Already on it. There is
no phone number listed,

29:18.330 --> 29:19.729
but we do have an address.

29:19.731 --> 29:21.564
Go.

29:23.402 --> 29:24.801
(high-pitched):
Glad to help.

29:24.803 --> 29:27.837
(door creaks)

29:27.839 --> 29:29.939
Hello?

29:31.676 --> 29:34.411
Hello?

29:34.413 --> 29:36.446
Tom?

29:37.549 --> 29:39.482
Hey.
(gasps) Tom!

29:39.484 --> 29:41.418
Oh, my God!

29:45.090 --> 29:46.723
Are you okay?

29:46.725 --> 29:47.991
Yeah.

29:47.993 --> 29:51.027
What is going on?
Why are you running?

29:51.029 --> 29:52.729
For your protection.

29:52.731 --> 29:54.798
Protection from what?

29:54.800 --> 29:57.901
I got into some things
I shouldn't have.

29:57.903 --> 30:00.069
That's why I have to leave.

30:00.071 --> 30:02.705
Why?

30:05.377 --> 30:08.645
What is this place?

30:08.647 --> 30:11.214
It smells like chlorine.

30:11.216 --> 30:13.349
It's bleach.

30:13.351 --> 30:16.586
Used to destroy evidence.

30:18.690 --> 30:21.925
Up until yesterday, this
place was a meth lab.

30:21.927 --> 30:24.093
Tom, this is really
freaking me out.

30:24.095 --> 30:25.295
That's why I
brought you here.

30:25.297 --> 30:27.330
I wanted you to know the truth.

30:27.332 --> 30:28.898
We all want
to know the truth.

30:28.900 --> 30:31.000
Ah!

30:31.002 --> 30:32.735
No, don't even think about it.

30:49.744 --> 30:53.903
In World War II, the U.S.
ground forces used smoke screens

30:53.904 --> 30:55.704
to hide their movements
from the enemy.

30:55.706 --> 31:00.709
The chemical found in those
devices is white phosphorus, WP.

31:00.711 --> 31:03.245
But the soldiers called it
something else, didn't they?

31:03.247 --> 31:05.380
Willie Pete.

31:05.382 --> 31:08.183
See, all this time,
we've been looking for a person,

31:08.185 --> 31:12.587
Randall Peters, but that's your
code name for red phosphorus.

31:12.589 --> 31:13.989
You stole the stuff
from the armory.

31:13.991 --> 31:15.724
And were paid very well.
We found the money.

31:15.726 --> 31:18.126
But last week, your C.O.
confronted you about the theft.

31:18.128 --> 31:19.661
You panicked.

31:19.663 --> 31:21.797
Told the buyer you couldn't
supply the phosphorus anymore.

31:21.799 --> 31:24.399
Next thing you know,
you're at the bottom of a lake.

31:24.401 --> 31:26.168
Wink if I'm getting close.

31:27.638 --> 31:30.205
We found you in a pretty
sophisticated meth lab.

31:30.207 --> 31:33.442
Now, I kind of doubt
you know how to cook meth.

31:33.444 --> 31:35.777
You were the supplier.

31:35.779 --> 31:37.813
Sheriff Pearson
provided protection.

31:37.815 --> 31:39.314
So who was the third person,

31:39.316 --> 31:40.715
the one that knows
pharmaceutical drugs?

31:40.717 --> 31:42.617
Louise had nothing
to do with this.

31:42.619 --> 31:43.652
We're talking
about her father.

31:43.654 --> 31:44.686
BISHOP:
Tom.

31:44.688 --> 31:45.887
You don't have
to protect him.

31:45.889 --> 31:46.922
He tried to kill you.

31:46.924 --> 31:48.390
No, that was Sheriff Pearson.

31:48.392 --> 31:50.125
And who do you think
ordered him to do that?

31:52.529 --> 31:55.664
I have been the town pharmacist
here for 30 years.

31:55.666 --> 31:56.608
There is no...

31:56.632 --> 31:58.367
Which means you were able
to get a large amount

31:58.368 --> 32:00.635
of pseudoephedrine
without raising suspicion.

32:00.637 --> 32:03.171
Crystal meth has
nine ingredients.

32:03.173 --> 32:04.906
Pharmacists have
access to eight.

32:04.908 --> 32:05.941
This is ludicrous.

32:05.943 --> 32:07.309
The only ingredient

32:07.311 --> 32:09.044
you couldn't get
is red phosphorus,

32:09.046 --> 32:10.879
until you realized that
your future son-in-law

32:10.881 --> 32:12.314
worked in an armory.

32:12.316 --> 32:15.217
Tom is accusing me?

32:15.219 --> 32:17.853
Sorry, Fred.
Got here as soon as I could.

32:17.855 --> 32:20.822
Well, what is
going on here?

32:20.824 --> 32:23.058
They say I'm running
a meth lab

32:23.060 --> 32:25.827
and that I tried to kill Tom.
- What?

32:25.829 --> 32:28.597
We're just about to ask him
about shooting Sheriff Pearson.

32:28.599 --> 32:30.866
Do you own a rifle?
Don't answer that.

32:30.868 --> 32:32.667
No, I don't.

32:32.669 --> 32:35.370
Do you like to fish,
Mr. Cabrisio?

32:35.372 --> 32:37.873
- Yeah, I like to fish.
- I don't know what that has to do...

32:37.875 --> 32:40.041
You have a boat?
Small skiff?

32:40.043 --> 32:42.844
I'm sure that
you already know I do.

32:42.846 --> 32:44.346
Witnesses say that a
guy in a fishing boat

32:44.348 --> 32:45.981
was the first person
on the scene

32:45.983 --> 32:47.616
of Sheriff Pearson's
car accident.

32:47.618 --> 32:49.851
Then he disappeared.
WEBBER: Where are you going with this?

32:49.853 --> 32:53.154
Do you think that Fred Cabrisio
is your criminal mastermind?

32:53.156 --> 32:54.923
You have nothing
on this man.

32:54.925 --> 32:57.058
VANCE:
<i>He's right.</i>

32:57.060 --> 32:58.960
We got to find something.

32:58.962 --> 33:00.529
The meth lab was bleached
from floor to ceiling.

33:00.531 --> 33:02.130
We're still
looking for DNA.

33:02.132 --> 33:04.533
What about the bullet that
killed Sheriff Pearson?

33:04.535 --> 33:07.369
Seems like Cabrisio didn't have
a-a weapon registered to him.

33:07.371 --> 33:09.738
Hmm, well, doesn't mean he
couldn't get his hands on one.

33:09.740 --> 33:13.074
Gibbs, where were you going
with the fishing questions?

33:13.076 --> 33:16.177
We were thinking that the guy
in the boat was a witness,

33:16.179 --> 33:17.779
but maybe he was
an accomplice

33:17.781 --> 33:20.916
and maybe he was there to make
sure that Sheriff Pearson

33:20.918 --> 33:23.018
got out of the car alive.

33:23.020 --> 33:25.787
You think Cabrisio was the one on the boat?
TORRES: Yeah.

33:25.789 --> 33:27.422
But the guy was wearing a jacket
and a hood up,

33:27.424 --> 33:28.490
so no one could I.D. him.

33:28.492 --> 33:30.358
Visually.

33:30.360 --> 33:33.028
There was an earwitness.

33:33.030 --> 33:34.763
A what?
GIBBS: Yeah.

33:34.765 --> 33:37.465
We got an idea.

33:37.467 --> 33:39.467
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

33:39.469 --> 33:42.070
I know.

33:42.072 --> 33:43.738
SLOANE:
Gentlemen, when I call you,

33:43.740 --> 33:46.207
please read the sentence
on the card loudly and clearly.

33:51.848 --> 33:53.448
Number one.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.951
"Hey. Are you all right?"

33:56.720 --> 33:58.887
No.

33:58.889 --> 34:00.355
Number two.

34:00.357 --> 34:02.891
"Hey. Are you all right?"

34:04.361 --> 34:05.293
SLOANE:
Number three.

34:05.295 --> 34:07.395
"Hey. Are you all right?"

34:08.264 --> 34:09.764
No.

34:10.634 --> 34:12.734
Number four.

34:16.039 --> 34:18.273
"Hey. Are you all right?"

34:21.110 --> 34:24.079
Can I hear four again?

34:26.750 --> 34:28.416
SLOANE:
Number four again, please.

34:29.719 --> 34:33.688
"Hey. Are you all right?"

34:36.092 --> 34:38.659
No. That's not him.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.397
SLOANE:
Thank you.

34:42.399 --> 34:44.733
Miss Barth, thank
you for coming in.

34:44.735 --> 34:45.634
That's it?

34:45.636 --> 34:47.034
TORRES:
Come on.

34:47.036 --> 34:48.570
I'll drive you home.

34:48.572 --> 34:49.838
Thanks very much,
Miss Barth.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.106
No problem.

34:53.076 --> 34:55.342
Well, now that you've proven
my client is innocent,

34:55.344 --> 34:56.645
I presume he's free to go?

34:56.647 --> 34:58.179
Yeah, for now.
We're not done yet.

34:58.181 --> 35:00.949
Okay. Good day, then, Agents.

35:00.951 --> 35:03.151
Special Agents.

35:05.455 --> 35:08.023
Ugh.
Yeah.

35:08.025 --> 35:11.860
Do you think that we can get
Petty Officer Billings

35:11.862 --> 35:14.029
to flip on the pharmacist?

35:14.031 --> 35:15.797
He's not gonna break.

35:15.799 --> 35:17.632
The guy's in love
with his daughter.

35:17.634 --> 35:19.501
Okay. Then we have to get
the father to confess.

35:19.503 --> 35:21.469
Good luck with that.

35:23.206 --> 35:24.506
Oh.

35:24.508 --> 35:26.941
You have a plan, Gibbs,
don't you?

35:26.943 --> 35:28.810
I see it all over you.

35:28.812 --> 35:30.812
(chuckles)

35:30.814 --> 35:34.349
Office of
Legislative Counsel?

35:34.351 --> 35:36.284
Yes. We're a team of lawyers

35:36.286 --> 35:38.019
who help Congress
draft legislation.

35:38.021 --> 35:40.889
So, you help write laws?

35:40.891 --> 35:42.223
Thank you.

35:42.225 --> 35:45.260
Yeah, bills, resolutions
and motions, as well.

35:45.262 --> 35:46.895
Harlan, turn on the lights.

35:46.897 --> 35:48.163
HARLAN:
Okay. Lights on.

35:48.165 --> 35:49.798
You don't think members
of Congress actually write

35:49.800 --> 35:51.933
any of the laws they pass,
do you?

35:51.935 --> 35:53.635
I don't think Congress
does anything.

35:53.637 --> 35:55.236
(chuckles) They do more
than you think.

35:55.238 --> 35:58.306
Just last year,
I helped craft 17 new bills.

35:58.308 --> 35:59.974
Damn.

35:59.976 --> 36:02.444
- So you're basically a badass.
- That's your title.

36:02.446 --> 36:05.313
You're the one with the guns
and the big biceps.

36:05.315 --> 36:07.182
(chuckles)

36:07.184 --> 36:10.085
Well, they are a decent size.

36:10.087 --> 36:11.786
I've held lots of arms.

36:11.788 --> 36:14.122
Yours are more than decent.
Coffee?

36:14.124 --> 36:17.492
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I should get back.

36:17.494 --> 36:19.461
Right. The investigation.

36:19.463 --> 36:21.563
Sorry I couldn't help you
catch the bad guy.

36:21.565 --> 36:24.499
Well, you got us this far.
We'll do the rest.

36:24.501 --> 36:28.036
Good luck, Nick, and...
thank you.

36:28.038 --> 36:29.204
For what?

36:29.206 --> 36:30.739
For believing in me.

36:30.741 --> 36:32.974
Well, you gave me no choice.

36:32.976 --> 36:35.410
Look at that. He's converted.

36:35.412 --> 36:37.278
My job here is done.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.714
All right. See you around.

36:46.256 --> 36:48.823
Honey?

36:48.825 --> 36:51.559
I need Mrs. Jenkins'
prescriptions.

36:51.561 --> 36:54.629
Hydrochlorothiazide,
furosemide.

36:59.603 --> 37:01.669
Where are the drugs?

37:01.671 --> 37:03.471
That's what I want to know.

37:03.473 --> 37:06.741
Last month, you ordered 90,000
milligrams of pseudoephedrine.

37:08.545 --> 37:11.312
Yeah. We've been, uh,
selling a lot of that.

37:11.314 --> 37:13.982
No. You haven't.

37:13.984 --> 37:18.787
The receipts show we only sold
18,000 milligrams.

37:21.224 --> 37:23.424
Where's the other 72?

37:25.729 --> 37:27.662
Dad.

37:27.664 --> 37:30.865
How should I know, honey?

37:34.271 --> 37:35.870
Dad.

37:35.872 --> 37:38.473
Don't ask questions

37:38.475 --> 37:40.475
unless you're prepared
to hear the answer.

37:40.477 --> 37:42.510
What?

37:42.512 --> 37:43.745
Look around you.

37:43.747 --> 37:45.480
It's pathetic.

37:45.482 --> 37:48.483
30 years of dolling out
diverticulitis drugs

37:48.485 --> 37:50.318
to geriatric hypochondriacs.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.620
Is that what you want?

37:52.622 --> 37:54.689
You <i>are</i> making crystal meth.

37:54.691 --> 37:57.458
I'm making money, lots of it.

37:57.460 --> 38:00.962
Or I was, until your precious
fiancé got cold feet.

38:00.964 --> 38:02.463
You took advantage of him.

38:02.465 --> 38:05.633
Then you-you tried to kill him.

38:05.635 --> 38:07.135
The Navy was asking questions.

38:07.137 --> 38:09.070
I thought that he would rat
the three of us out.

38:09.072 --> 38:10.205
He never would.

38:13.743 --> 38:15.844
But I just did.

38:17.514 --> 38:19.480
Agent Gibbs?

38:19.482 --> 38:22.550
(door opens, closes)

38:22.552 --> 38:24.586
I can't believe it.

38:26.857 --> 38:29.657
I can't believe it.

38:31.428 --> 38:33.962
Turn around. Hands
behind your back.

38:33.964 --> 38:35.797
I know that
that was hard.

38:35.799 --> 38:37.699
Hands behind your back.

38:37.701 --> 38:41.536
It was the right thing
to do.

38:41.538 --> 38:43.538
(handcuffs clicking)

38:43.540 --> 38:47.175
Hey. Who is "the three of us"?

38:47.177 --> 38:49.244
You said that
you thought that

38:49.246 --> 38:51.779
Billings was gonna rat
"the three of us" out.

38:51.781 --> 38:53.414
That's you,

38:53.416 --> 38:55.583
Sheriff Pearson and who else?

38:58.121 --> 39:00.788
I got it.
I'm calling Torres right now.

39:00.790 --> 39:02.523
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

39:02.525 --> 39:06.027
You change your mind
about coffee, Nick?

39:06.029 --> 39:08.630
Not Nick.

39:10.433 --> 39:13.301
(grunting)

39:14.938 --> 39:15.937
"Hey.

39:15.939 --> 39:17.105
Are you all right?"

39:17.107 --> 39:19.374
Stay away from me.
Stay away.

39:19.376 --> 39:23.544
I guess it's safe to assume
you recognize my voice.

39:23.546 --> 39:25.179
The man on the boat.

39:25.181 --> 39:26.814
Harlan, turn off the lights.

39:26.816 --> 39:28.116
HARLAN:
Okay. Lights off.

39:29.286 --> 39:31.419
WEBBER:
Clever.

39:31.421 --> 39:33.354
Leveling the playing field.

39:33.356 --> 39:35.857
But I can still hear
your footsteps.

39:35.859 --> 39:38.693
Harlan, turn on the lights.

39:38.695 --> 39:41.896
(chuckles softly)
You unplugged Harlan.

39:41.898 --> 39:44.732
Well, score another point
for Annie Barth.

39:44.734 --> 39:46.935
You forgot something.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.006
Cell phones.

39:53.843 --> 39:57.612
Cell phones can be so...

39:57.614 --> 40:00.848
so... handy.

40:07.891 --> 40:10.191
(groans)
Bitch!

40:12.062 --> 40:14.228
No, no. Where you going?
Come here.

40:14.230 --> 40:15.463
(gasping)

40:20.403 --> 40:23.137
Ah, that's right.

40:23.139 --> 40:25.173
Quiet down.

40:27.143 --> 40:29.444
(Annie gasping)

40:31.214 --> 40:32.680
(coughs)

40:32.682 --> 40:34.315
Annie?

40:34.317 --> 40:35.616
Annie.

40:35.618 --> 40:37.352
- You're okay, you're okay. Come here.
- Nick.

40:37.354 --> 40:40.755
Come here.

40:40.757 --> 40:42.457
You're all right.

40:42.459 --> 40:44.659
(panting)

40:49.199 --> 40:52.467
(doorbells jingle,
classic rock music playing)

40:52.469 --> 40:54.802
So, Annie Barth
is okay, huh?

40:54.804 --> 40:57.271
Uh, bruised neck.

40:57.273 --> 40:59.007
She had quite the scare,
but she'll recover.

40:59.009 --> 41:01.275
I guess Torres
got there just in time.

41:01.277 --> 41:03.644
BISHOP: Yeah. Webber Silk,
on the other hand,

41:03.646 --> 41:05.013
has a concussion.

41:05.015 --> 41:06.781
Torres hit him hard.

41:06.783 --> 41:09.517
Well, he'll have plenty of
time to recover in prison.

41:09.519 --> 41:11.052
Thanks.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.721
Abby matched the bullet
that killed Sheriff Pearson

41:13.723 --> 41:15.790
to a rifle
that Silk owns.

41:15.792 --> 41:17.392
Silk was tying up
loose ends.

41:17.394 --> 41:19.027
Ah, should've known.

41:19.029 --> 41:21.229
Uh, hey, Torres.
Hey, Annie.

41:21.231 --> 41:22.497
Hi.

41:22.499 --> 41:24.832
Annie, remember Agent Bishop?
And this is Agent McGee.

41:24.834 --> 41:26.234
Yes. Nice to meet you.
Hello.

41:26.236 --> 41:27.902
Uh, what are you guys
doing here?

41:27.904 --> 41:29.504
Well, Nick solved
the case,

41:29.506 --> 41:31.239
so I'm taking him
out to celebrate.

41:31.241 --> 41:33.474
Well, it was
a team effort, right?

41:33.476 --> 41:36.344
These two helped,
like, four percent.

41:36.346 --> 41:37.512
So kind.

41:37.514 --> 41:38.513
Yeah.

41:38.515 --> 41:40.214
Uh, well, you, too, Annie.

41:40.216 --> 41:41.983
Thanks for your help.
We're glad you're okay.

41:41.985 --> 41:45.119
Thank you.
I'm just glad Nick...

41:45.121 --> 41:46.654
(sighs)
...you know.

41:46.656 --> 41:50.558
Uh, timing.
Either you have it or you don't.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.326
Uh, well, join us for breakfast.

41:52.328 --> 41:54.328
Yeah, sure.
No, we'll let you guys eat.

41:54.330 --> 41:56.297
What? No.
There's plenty of room.

41:57.967 --> 41:59.267
Actually, uh, Bishop,
you know what?

41:59.269 --> 42:00.501
I wanted to talk to you,

42:00.503 --> 42:02.336
just the two of us,
if you don't mind.

42:02.338 --> 42:04.572
Okay, Agent McGee.

42:04.574 --> 42:06.340
Here, I'll, uh,
I'll get us a table.

42:06.342 --> 42:08.242
Thank you, Agent Bishop.
Maybe next time.

42:08.244 --> 42:09.644
Okay.

42:09.646 --> 42:12.313
Um, can I help
you at all?

42:12.315 --> 42:14.115
Oh, trust me, McGee.
She doesn't need any help.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.316
(chuckles)

42:15.318 --> 42:17.118
Yeah, found us a table.

42:23.359 --> 42:25.693
Well? What is it?

42:25.695 --> 42:26.694
What's what?

42:26.696 --> 42:28.362
What'd you want
to talk to me about?

42:28.364 --> 42:30.131
Oh, nothing.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.600
No, it's just 'cause Torres
wanted to be alone with Annie.

42:32.602 --> 42:34.669
Really?
Hmm.

42:36.539 --> 42:39.240
Like a... like a date?

42:42.145 --> 42:44.145
(laughs)
