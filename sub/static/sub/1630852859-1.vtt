00:00.734 --> 00:02.134
[Shauna]
<i>If you were to look at me,</i>

00:02.136 --> 00:04.269
<i>you would think
I'm just a normal little girl</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:08.173
<i>doing normal little girl things
with my fun, crazy family.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.675
[Shauna]

00:09.677 --> 00:12.277
- Because you're supposed to sit up.
- I am sitting up.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.680
- She can't see.
- I still can't see over the dashboard.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.182
But the truth is
I'm not a little girl.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.319
I'm a woman.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.588
A 22-year-old woman...

00:24.924 --> 00:27.393
trapped in the body
of an eight-year-old.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.029
We can't have
children at the bar.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.999
- I want to get a tattoo.
- How old are you?

00:34.001 --> 00:36.602
- There is an age requirement.
- I'm 22.

00:37.737 --> 00:40.105
Even though I can't
physically grow up,

00:40.107 --> 00:43.108
<i>I desperately want to
be treated like an adult.</i>

00:44.310 --> 00:46.412
What are we gonna say
in your bio?

00:46.414 --> 00:49.148
My relationship status
is single.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.817
I'm short. Leave me alone.

00:51.819 --> 00:55.354
I attract creeps,
[bleep] and idiots.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.689
<i>It is scary to
put myself out there,</i>

00:57.691 --> 01:00.793
but you have to put some
risk in to get happiness.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.661
<i>So, today I am
going on a blind date.</i>

01:02.663 --> 01:04.997
- Hi, I'm Shauna.
- Hi, Shauna.

01:04.999 --> 01:08.100
I thought that I was being
punked or something at first.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.605
We're here for
a bachelorette party.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.676
My first thought was, "Is that
a kid?" I was a little shocked.

01:19.879 --> 01:23.048
<i>[Shauna] Some other customers
decided to call the owner.</i>

01:23.050 --> 01:26.218
When people want to verify
my age that pisses me off.

01:28.488 --> 01:32.057
I do desire more independence from
my family because I can't go anywhere

01:32.059 --> 01:34.059
without them asking questions.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.295
Who are you going to the
brewery with? Who's driving?

01:36.297 --> 01:37.596
When are you gonna be back?

01:38.231 --> 01:39.765
Be careful.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.501
<i>[Shauna] I've tried to put
my foot down with my parents</i>

01:42.503 --> 01:44.069
<i>about doing more
independent things.</i>

01:44.170 --> 01:45.604
[Shauna]

01:49.109 --> 01:53.479
I don't know if I'm ready to let
her go, but she needs to be let go.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.080
- No.
- Yeah. See?

01:55.082 --> 01:56.782
You have to tell them, "No."

01:56.784 --> 01:58.784
I'm working on my independence.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.919
People tell me I'm a fun drunk.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.955
- Like, something like that.
- Yeah.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.923
You're a natural.

02:04.925 --> 02:09.094
<i>[Shauna] And I'm determined to
make this year my year to shine.</i>

02:21.040 --> 02:23.509
[Patty] Shauna, wake up.
We have to get ready.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.013
You want to get up?

02:30.183 --> 02:33.652
Come on. [gasps] Come on.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.122
My name is Shauna Rae,
but I go by Shauna for short.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.393
[gasps] Hi.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.929
Go.

02:43.931 --> 02:48.066
What should you know
about me? [laughs]

02:48.068 --> 02:51.537
I think I'm funny.
I'm sarcastic.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.506
I have a temper. [laughs]

02:54.508 --> 02:59.311
<i>I'm smart, too. I mean,
that's there. I have a brain.</i>

03:03.516 --> 03:05.450
Um...

03:06.786 --> 03:08.186
I'm short.

03:13.293 --> 03:17.896
<i>I'm 22-years-old but my
height is three feet 10 inches,</i>

03:17.898 --> 03:20.332
and my weight
is around 50 pounds.

03:23.269 --> 03:26.071
I live life trapped in the
body of an eight-year-old.

03:31.044 --> 03:35.781
When I was six months old my mom
noticed a bump on the back of my head,

03:35.783 --> 03:41.153
so she took me to the doctor
and the doctor said it was a tumor.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.622
A very aggressive
cancerous tumor.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.294
I went in to immediate surgery,

03:49.296 --> 03:53.465
and after the surgery I went
through chemo for two to three years,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.500
and I was deemed cancer-free.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.838
I was around five
and it was Kindergarten.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.375
They noticed that every kid
was significantly taller than me.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.077
<i>There was at least
a foot difference</i>

04:05.079 --> 04:06.311
between me and these other kids.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.948
<i>That's when they took me
back to children's hospital</i>

04:09.950 --> 04:16.288
and learned that my pituitary
gland was very close to dormant.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.591
So, all of my hormones, my
growth hormone, my sweat glands,

04:19.593 --> 04:23.528
all of that
produces much slower.

04:23.530 --> 04:28.700
I got on growth hormones but, unfortunately,
the doctor told me I was done growing.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.103
My bones were fused at 16.

04:32.338 --> 04:37.943
So I didn't have this realization
that I wasn't gonna be normal

04:37.945 --> 04:39.478
until I was 16.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.980
That moment was almost,
like, the world shattered.

04:46.519 --> 04:47.819
Come on.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.522
<i>I want to live my life like
my friends and my sisters do,</i>

04:50.524 --> 04:53.191
but I need my mother, my
father, and the rest of the world

04:53.193 --> 04:55.193
to realize that I'm an adult.

04:57.964 --> 05:03.302
My life is complex in a way. The
advantages to my situation are

05:03.304 --> 05:07.205
<i>you get lollipops
at hair salons,</i>

05:07.207 --> 05:10.976
<i>you don't get stopped by people
on the street asking me for stuff.</i>

05:10.978 --> 05:15.847
You can play dumb when you
need to, so that always works.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.417
And then, when you talk really
smart people are really surprised

05:18.419 --> 05:21.053
and think your a baby genius
until they realize that you're 22.

05:21.055 --> 05:24.189
Or they just don't believe
you but that's besides the point.

05:26.225 --> 05:29.261
<i>Physically is where
all the bad parts are, though.</i>

05:29.263 --> 05:31.797
I can't drive,
I can't sit down on a seat

05:31.799 --> 05:33.732
with my feet
touching the ground.

05:33.734 --> 05:38.170
I can't reach counters.
I have to use stools.

05:38.172 --> 05:42.941
I have to hop on couches,
and beds, and stuff.

05:44.043 --> 05:48.146
- [Tara shouting] Shauna!
- I have to put my heels on.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.183
[Shauna] <i>I think that,
medically, my situation is rare.</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:54.419
I know that my dwarfism is rare
because it's medically caused.

05:54.421 --> 06:00.025
I know... that my personality
is rare. [laughs sheepishly]

06:00.927 --> 06:04.396
- Oh [bleep].
- [all laughing]

06:05.231 --> 06:07.466
- [Mark] Good job, Tank.
- Thank you.

06:07.468 --> 06:11.136
<i>[Shauna] I live on Long Island with
my mother, Patty, my step-father, Mark,</i>

06:11.138 --> 06:13.238
<i>and my younger sister, Rylee.</i>

06:13.240 --> 06:17.442
<i>My older sister, Tara, lives in
Florida with her fiance, Jesse,</i>

06:17.444 --> 06:20.245
<i>but she visits
as much as she can.</i>

06:20.247 --> 06:23.281
- Are you guys going?
- We're going to brunch.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.016
- Going to brunch?
- Yeah.

06:25.018 --> 06:29.287
<i>[Shauna] My mother, Patty,
is overprotective.</i>

06:29.289 --> 06:34.226
She's hardworking, she is very
family-orientated, and she wants to make sure

06:34.228 --> 06:36.828
that we're healthy, we're happy.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.265
<i>And then my step-dad, Mark,
he is the eccentric one.</i>

06:40.267 --> 06:45.003
He is funny, he's charismatic,
he loves to entertain.

06:45.005 --> 06:49.374
<i>He took my sister, Tara, and I in
and treated us like his own daughters.</i>

06:49.376 --> 06:50.609
Ready?

06:52.578 --> 06:54.846
- Don't hit the guy.
- I got it.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.381
Do you?

06:56.383 --> 07:02.821
[Shauna] My older sister,
Tara, she's... lovely.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.223
<i>She's very independent.</i>

07:05.225 --> 07:11.096
She's just stubborn, and she's very
opinionated, and her opinions are strong.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.966
<i>And then my younger sister,
Rylee, she's like my best friend.</i>

07:14.968 --> 07:19.438
She is my support system.
She's eccentric, she's creative.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.008
She's more reserved, though.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.243
- Sit up.
- Shut up.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.845
[Tara and Shauna laugh]

07:26.847 --> 07:30.549
- Do you need a booster seat?
- [laughs]

07:30.551 --> 07:33.418
- We can ask the restaurant for one.
- I will murder you.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.889
Yeah, we're gonna... [laughs] Kids
menu. "Oh, can she have crayons?"

07:37.891 --> 07:40.025
- No.
- "Please? We need to keep her quiet."

07:40.027 --> 07:42.160
[Tara] Oh, I'm supposed
to be in the right lane.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.663
I have no clue what lane you're
in. I can't see over the dash.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.165
I'm in the right. Yeah, because
you're supposed to sit up.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.368
- I am sitting up. I still can't see over the dashboard.
- She can't see.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.305
- She needs the booster seat.
- Yeah. You need a car seat.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.106
- Shut up.
- I can't see.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.376
Shauna, when you're
in the car with her

07:58.378 --> 08:02.314
she should be in the back seat
in a car seat.

08:02.316 --> 08:07.619
But it's a little difficult
to tell a 22-year-old...

08:08.821 --> 08:11.223
to... [laughs]
to get in the car seat.

08:11.225 --> 08:14.025
So, legally, weight-wise, I'm
supposed to be in a car seat.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.963
Height-wise, I have no clue.
I refuse, either way.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.333
I have been pulled over
a couple of times.

08:21.335 --> 08:27.272
We got to pull out IDs and she's
got to talk to them. And it's just...

08:27.874 --> 08:31.343
It's a thing.
It's just a thing.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.913
-There's a hookah lounge. Have you ever done hookah?
-No.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.182
- Hookah's so bad for you.
- I know.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.886
-I don't smoke hookah. I just saw a hookah lounge.
-It's gross.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.053
Yeah but you smoke that vape.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.323
That has nicotine in it, FYI.

08:45.325 --> 08:49.327
- It does... pretty small.
- FYI, shut the hell up.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.963
Tara definitely likes to, uh...

08:53.199 --> 08:54.165
Call Shauna out.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.368
Yeah, hold Shauna accountable

08:56.370 --> 08:59.037
for anything that Tara
sees as, you know,

09:00.006 --> 09:02.107
maybe subpar, or...

09:02.109 --> 09:05.810
or substandard actions.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.179
You're talking about Tara
like she's so hoity-toity.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.382
- Oh, she is, yeah.
- No, she's not!

09:20.927 --> 09:24.129
I know that walking in
anywhere, I will get stares.

09:24.131 --> 09:28.166
But walking into an adult
environment is a little concerning,

09:28.168 --> 09:30.435
because people stare,
they're gonna comment

09:30.437 --> 09:32.370
and then it's just gonna
make me uncomfortable.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.442
We can't have children
at the bar.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.179
Oh, we need photos.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.416
<i>[Shauna] My sisters decided
to create a dating profile for me.</i>

09:44.418 --> 09:45.984
What are we gonna say
in your bio?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.819
"I'm short, leave me alone."

09:47.821 --> 09:49.988
The problem with online is

09:49.990 --> 09:53.892
you don't know
what their intentions are.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.160
Michael looks cute.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.261
He looks like a [bleep]-boy.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.197
My love life in general
isn't the best

09:59.199 --> 10:01.666
because people don't
understand I'm an adult.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.946
We can't have children
at the bar.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.191
- Can I get some ID?
- What?

10:26.193 --> 10:27.325
Can I get some ID?

10:39.005 --> 10:40.038
[Shauna] Thank you.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.140
- Who's got the panini?
- [Tara] Me! Thank you.

10:43.843 --> 10:44.943
[Rylee] Yep.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.180
- Thank you.
- So...

10:52.351 --> 10:54.285
[both laugh]

10:54.287 --> 10:56.321
So, which one of us
is gonna be your bridesmaid?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.390
[chuckles]

10:58.891 --> 11:00.525
I am 24 years old

11:00.527 --> 11:02.093
<i>and I'm engaged.</i>

11:02.095 --> 11:03.728
<i>And Shauna's 22,</i>

11:03.730 --> 11:05.397
<i>so I'm only two years
older than her.</i>

11:05.399 --> 11:07.298
It seems like we have
a greater age difference

11:07.300 --> 11:09.234
than the two years.

11:09.236 --> 11:14.239
Mentally, physically,
emotionally, all the things.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.540
<i>[Patty] I definitely believe</i>

11:15.542 --> 11:19.244
<i>that there is a little bit
of resentment...</i>

11:19.246 --> 11:21.046
[Frank] I think there's more
than a little bit.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.414
Yeah, from Shauna towards Tara.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.016
I think Shauna almost
looks at it like,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.619
Tara is leading the life
that she could have led

11:28.254 --> 11:29.287
had she been...

11:29.289 --> 11:31.389
- Just a little bit taller.
- Yeah.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.259
<i>[Shauna] It is difficult
seeing that my other friends</i>

11:34.261 --> 11:36.761
and my family are being
more independent,

11:36.763 --> 11:40.432
but I don't envy or have
any jealousy towards Tara

11:40.434 --> 11:42.400
and what her choices
for her life have been,

11:42.402 --> 11:44.469
whether that's college
and moving out,

11:44.471 --> 11:47.405
but I think it's entirely
unfair of my parents

11:47.407 --> 11:49.774
that they treat Tara and I
a little differently

11:49.776 --> 11:52.377
even though we're two
years apart.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.380
<i>They always say that they want me
to start my independence on my own</i>

11:55.382 --> 11:56.915
with my own actions,

11:56.917 --> 11:59.284
but I can't do that
if I have a leash on me.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.287
We're both gonna be bridesmaids.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.023
Maybe I can have two
maid of honors.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.391
Yeah, I don't wanna be
a maid of honor.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.860
Okay, then, easy.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.228
You're the maid of honor.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.869
[Shauna] Yeah! I have any
kind of relationship, right?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.038
My romantic life kind of sucks.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.374
<i>I think I've dated, like,
seven people.</i>

12:23.376 --> 12:25.343
I attract creeps,

12:25.345 --> 12:28.146
um, a-[bleep].

12:28.148 --> 12:31.883
You know? Like, the typical quote-unquote
bad boy picture kinda situation.

12:31.885 --> 12:32.950
And idiots!

12:33.018 --> 12:34.886
<i>My last relationship
had ended specifically</i>

12:34.888 --> 12:38.123
because he didn't wanna go out
to a restaurant with me

12:38.125 --> 12:40.859
or just go out
and take a walk with me.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.060
And those are the kind of things

12:42.062 --> 12:44.996
that I look for as red flags.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.065
He said I have a pretty face

12:47.067 --> 12:48.600
but my body is [bleep].

12:49.268 --> 12:52.003
I have a great personality

12:52.005 --> 12:53.438
but I'm a bitch.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.807
[Rylee] He said what-a what-a?

12:55.809 --> 12:58.042
We're not together anymore,
it doesn't matter.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.277
- You still talk to him.
- I do.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.512
I wouldn't talk
to him after that.

13:00.514 --> 13:01.946
Yeah, don't talk to him.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.582
You know we're right.

13:04.584 --> 13:09.020
<i>[Shauna] It's difficult to date
when you look like an eight-year-old.</i>

13:09.022 --> 13:11.222
A lot of guys have an issue
with it at first.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.258
Um...

13:13.260 --> 13:15.660
They feel that, like,

13:16.328 --> 13:17.862
sense of staring,

13:17.864 --> 13:21.032
and that's why a lot of my
relationships just don't work.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.301
It's because they don't know
how to deal with my height.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.237
[Rylee] You gotta meet
better guys, that's just it.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.406
You have to...

13:29.141 --> 13:30.475
It's hard to meet new people

13:30.477 --> 13:33.444
because people don't
understand that I'm an adult.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.213
People don't think
to come up to me

13:35.215 --> 13:36.414
or hit on me or anything.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.751
It takes them a while to get
to know me and understand,

13:39.753 --> 13:43.421
"Okay, she actually is
intelligent, she is an adult."

13:43.423 --> 13:45.256
This is why we're gonna
make you a dating app.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.325
- Ew.
- Yeah, then we can choose for you.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.426
[Rylee] Yeah!

13:48.428 --> 13:51.329
That's not asking out,
that's swiping left and right.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.399
I don't understand that concept.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.768
- [Rylee] We'll figure it out.
- We'll teach you.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.504
<i>[Shauna] I'm hesitant
about trying online dating</i>

13:59.506 --> 14:03.107
because it's not something
that feels natural to me.

14:03.109 --> 14:07.979
It takes away that opportunity
of people just meeting me

14:07.981 --> 14:09.581
and wanting to make
a connection.

14:17.456 --> 14:18.790
<i>[Tara] Oh, we need photos.</i>

14:18.792 --> 14:20.758
- Okay.
- Well, you don't take photos,

14:20.760 --> 14:22.694
which means we have
to take photos for you.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.362
- We need to take photos for you.
- I have clothes.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.965
I've never really
online dated before,

14:26.967 --> 14:29.934
<i>but my sisters convinced me
to create a dating profile</i>

14:29.936 --> 14:32.170
because that's what people
my age are doing.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.838
There's this romper.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.940
- That's cute.
- It is cute.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.077
There's this dress,
which is just a skirt.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.945
- Where's the dress?
- It's not a dress.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.313
- It's a two-piece?
- It's just a skirt...

14:42.315 --> 14:44.148
- Where is it?
- And then...

14:44.150 --> 14:45.516
this is the top.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.652
That might get some attention.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.054
The wrong kind of attention.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.591
It's so difficult just
shopping when you're...

14:54.960 --> 14:56.327
shorter, I guess.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.997
Finding clothes
that fit perfectly

14:59.198 --> 15:01.266
is slim to none.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.434
Do you want a picture
of that outfit?

15:03.436 --> 15:04.936
Do you?

15:04.938 --> 15:05.937
It's your profile.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.672
Do you wanna look
like a teacher?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.475
<i>[Shauna] Most of the time
I go to the kids' section.</i>

15:10.477 --> 15:12.377
But most of these clothes
now have sparkles,

15:12.379 --> 15:13.511
they have unicorns,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.413
they have cookies
with eyeballs on it.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.181
If I look in the mirror

15:17.183 --> 15:18.950
and I see something
that reminds me

15:18.952 --> 15:20.652
of something
I wore during childhood

15:20.654 --> 15:22.220
or I see a child wear,

15:22.888 --> 15:24.856
I will not wear it.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.858
So Rylee doesn't
wanna do this...

15:26.860 --> 15:28.226
but we're going to do this.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.395
- Yes.
- At least wear leggings instead of the skirt.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.096
- Nope.
- Oh...

15:32.098 --> 15:35.433
[Mark] Shauna also
wants to, um...

15:35.435 --> 15:39.370
overcompensate for her size

15:39.372 --> 15:41.572
by dressing a little more...

15:42.207 --> 15:43.374
provocatively.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.876
- [Tara] All right, you ready?
- Not really.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.077
Are you smiling?

15:46.278 --> 15:47.345
Like that?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.314
- You don't wanna look like a child.
- Bite the apple.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.983
[Tara laughs] Bite the apple.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.919
I hate y'all. So much.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.521
Then you have to change now.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.589
- Which one?
- [resigned] This one.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.425
- Get it over with.
- Okay.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.427
Okay.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.263
I told you not the skirt!

16:05.265 --> 16:06.564
[Tara] Oh, my God!

16:06.566 --> 16:07.999
Isn't it great?

16:08.867 --> 16:10.101
[unhappily] Yeah. It's great.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.004
Smile, bite the apple.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.305
- A little softer.
- [Rylee] Yes.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.407
Bite a softer apple.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.842
[Rylee] Less intense.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.110
A little bit of side. Yeah!

16:19.112 --> 16:21.212
Yeah, yeah, a little of skin.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.081
- Yeah, more skin.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.049
She thinks I dress like a whore.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.117
Okay, here's the thing.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.386
All of our styles
are very different.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.990
<i>I'm more dark, Shauna is
more preppy and Tara is...</i>

16:31.992 --> 16:33.424
schoolteacher now.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.193
Bow, no bow?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.394
That is much better.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.895
Oh, is it much better?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.530
That's so much better.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.898
I like the bow. Bow is cute.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.133
You wanna put me
on a dating app,

16:42.135 --> 16:43.468
but you don't want me
to dress provocative.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.370
You wanna dress provocative?

16:46.138 --> 16:48.740
- I have the clothes.
- I know...

16:48.742 --> 16:51.476
There is plenty of bad
situations that can happen

16:51.478 --> 16:54.078
when it comes to people
that wanna date me.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.480
Um...

16:55.482 --> 16:59.317
The attraction
to younger people,

16:59.319 --> 17:01.652
children exactly, is an issue.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.222
And there have been times
that I've attracted that.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.891
And they haven't been, like,
super old creepy guys all the time,

17:06.893 --> 17:08.192
but sometimes they are,

17:08.194 --> 17:10.194
sometimes they're younger,
and it's just creepy.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.296
What are we gonna say
in your bio?

17:12.298 --> 17:14.365
"I'm short, leave me alone."

17:14.367 --> 17:16.300
Oh, 'cause that would get
so many responses.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.702
That is not going to get hits.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.170
And the cancer...

17:19.172 --> 17:21.005
- "I've also had cancer."
- Cancer.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.807
Do people really put that
on their dating profile?

17:22.809 --> 17:24.308
Oh... yes.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.444
<i>[Mark] Online dating
for Shauna, I think,</i>

17:26.446 --> 17:28.212
<i>is a slippery slope.</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:30.114
The problem with online is

17:30.116 --> 17:33.017
- you don't know what...
- They really are.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.485
- their intentions are.
- Yeah.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.123
Are they allowed within 500
yards of a elementary school?

17:39.125 --> 17:41.793
- I mean, those are--
- You just went there.

17:41.795 --> 17:45.663
Those are serious concerns
of mine.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.499
Add your first profile prompt.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.335
A pro and con of dating me.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.238
[laughs]

17:54.240 --> 17:57.041
I could think
of a really dirty pro.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.943
You gotta say it now.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.311
You're at the right height.

18:00.313 --> 18:04.248
-Yeah, we know. I know that for sure.
-[laughs]

18:06.151 --> 18:07.952
You wanna put that
on your profile?

18:07.954 --> 18:10.021
<i>When it comes
to physical intimacy,</i>

18:10.023 --> 18:12.156
the boxes have all been checked.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.358
Michael looks cute.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.928
He looks like a [bleep] boy.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.064
He's looking for a
relationship. That's s good guy.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.066
He can't spell Connecticut.

18:22.068 --> 18:25.536
He did put a Q in Connecticut.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.238
- Maybe that's--
- No.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.074
There's no explaining that.
That's bad.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.809
- Pass.
- Ooh, Greg!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.311
Kind of a nerd.
This is perfect.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.012
- "I have a dog."
- He has a dog.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.380
Bunch of musical instruments.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.249
Cancer survivor. Yes!

18:38.251 --> 18:40.418
- [cheering]
- We're playing.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.920
Yes, he's
a cancer survivor, Shauna.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.424
<i>[Shaina] I'm looking
for someone who's nice.</i>

18:46.426 --> 18:50.261
Has integrity. Maybe funny.
Funny's good, too.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.863
Funny's really good.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.297
What were you guys
doing upstairs?

18:53.299 --> 18:56.200
We're just hoping to
spice up her life a little bit.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.535
What were you doing?

18:57.537 --> 19:00.037
We made Shauna a dating profile.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.405
- We like Greg.
- What?

19:01.407 --> 19:02.673
Stop saying Greg.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.075
Who is Greg?

19:04.077 --> 19:08.079
He's a cancer survivor.
College grad.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.148
Didn't spell Connecticut
with a Q.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.649
Does he know how tall you are?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.718
I don't know.
None of them know probably.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.453
- We put it on your profile.
- It's on your profile.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.990
<i>[Shauna] My family's gotten
way too involved in my dating life.</i>

19:18.992 --> 19:20.791
They instantly
wanna know the person.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.794
They instantly wanna know if
he's gonna stick around or not.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.931
And I just wanna have fun
with some people.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.267
But we liked Greg.
Greg has to like us.

19:29.269 --> 19:33.337
Okay, Greg's not liking us.
Greg's liking Shauna.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.373
[Mark] Yeah, sounds like
Greg's dealing with three people.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.941
We like Greg.

19:36.943 --> 19:40.077
At this point I am open to
dating and having a relationship,

19:40.079 --> 19:43.114
<i>but I'm not sure
if online dating is for me.</i>

19:43.116 --> 19:45.950
My family and I are spending
the day at the Jersey Shore.

19:47.152 --> 19:48.186
No!

19:48.188 --> 19:52.056
<i>I feel extremely awkward
around children.</i>

19:52.058 --> 19:54.792
I have little boys
blushing at me.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.461
Boys are like,
"Why do you have bom-boms?"

19:59.231 --> 20:01.165
I hate bumper cars
for this exact reason.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.900
I can't do it ever.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.335
[Mark] You ride with me.
We'll kick ass.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.836
When it comes to amusement parks

20:05.838 --> 20:08.472
and their height restriction
thing, it is really difficult

20:08.474 --> 20:12.443
because it takes away
my sense of independence.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.455
- You got that.
- Yeah, totally.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.923
I can totally see.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.792
All right, go. This is
your first driving test.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.894
- No it's not.
- No, that's a car.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.995
- Turn. Turn.
- To the right, to the right.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.263
- Turn.
- [laughs]

20:32.265 --> 20:35.700
My family and I are spending
the day at the Jersey Shore.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.401
- [Patty] Run it, Shauna.
- [all chuckle]

20:38.270 --> 20:39.437
Go, Shauna.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.306
When I think beach,
I think bathing suits.

20:42.308 --> 20:46.110
<i>And bathing suits,
oh, they're fun.</i>

20:46.112 --> 20:50.815
It's difficult, because now that
I do have maturity in my chest,

20:50.817 --> 20:53.618
um, I need padding.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.120
And no children swim suits
have padding.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.722
<i>And the bottoms are even worse.</i>

20:57.724 --> 20:59.690
<i>They're uncomfortable somewhere.</i>

20:59.692 --> 21:02.960
If they don't work on the
bottom, they work on the top,

21:02.962 --> 21:05.263
if they don't work on the top,
they work on the bottom.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.430
Try the water.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.133
Let's go.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.069
The beach
can also be challenging,

21:12.071 --> 21:14.305
because there are kids there
and that's a whole other thing.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.040
Go ahead.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.445
[Shauna] <i>Because I look like
a child, I'm treated like e child.</i>

21:21.447 --> 21:27.485
Everywhere I go, I have children
waving to me saying hi, looking at me

21:27.487 --> 21:29.887
and little boys blushing at me.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.890
Like, I--

21:32.892 --> 21:36.394
It's really weird, because children
are just kinda like drawn to me.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.561
[indistinct]

21:47.673 --> 21:49.540
- Go try again.
- No!

21:51.209 --> 21:52.610
No!

21:52.612 --> 21:56.681
Usually when a kid
comes to me, I--

21:56.683 --> 22:00.117
I'm respectful, if they
wanna color, I'll color with the,

22:00.119 --> 22:03.020
but I usually make sure
it's okay with their parents.

22:03.022 --> 22:07.191
Because usually the parent understands
I'm a little older than the kid thinks.

22:11.430 --> 22:15.666
I feel extremely awkward
around boys.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.902
I don't feel awkward
around girls.

22:17.904 --> 22:21.172
Girls seem to be more
understanding about the human body

22:21.174 --> 22:23.207
and what happens to females.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.177
Boys are like,
why do you have bom-boms?

22:26.179 --> 22:28.346
[Patty] Shauna,
come fly the kite.

22:30.215 --> 22:31.315
Ready? You got it?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.050
Hold it tight.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.686
- Ready?
- [Patty] Step away.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.858
Go! Go, Shauna!

22:40.860 --> 22:43.561
Go, Shauna!
Keep going, Shauna.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.236
They started cheering.

22:52.938 --> 22:53.971
And because of their cheering,

22:53.973 --> 22:55.539
I felt like I had to run longer,

22:55.541 --> 22:57.708
<i>and I was so out of breath.</i>

22:58.643 --> 22:59.810
[Patty] Keep going.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.079
So when we saw the little
girl running with the kite,

23:02.081 --> 23:03.814
we're all hanging out,
having a good time,

23:03.816 --> 23:05.816
and then we just got
really excited for her,

23:05.818 --> 23:07.385
'cause she looked like
she was having a blast.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.853
So we just
started cheering for her.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.054
[all cheering]

23:10.056 --> 23:14.024
I would say she looks like
eight or ten. Young. Yeah.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.297
- [both] Wow!
- She's my age.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.401
Oh, there's a string. [laughs]

23:25.070 --> 23:26.937
I didn't know
why they were cheering.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.006
I honestly thought
they had too much to drink.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.544
But if it was
because I was a kid, cool.

23:33.546 --> 23:38.115
It was definitely interesting
to hear people clap over a kite.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.050
That was weird.

23:40.052 --> 23:43.220
Just so you know, I'm not
pushing that cart up that ramp.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.228
This afternoon
we're at Casino Pier

23:51.230 --> 23:53.431
to play some games
and ride some rides.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.200
- What are you gonna ride today?
- I don't know.

23:56.968 --> 24:00.971
- Whatever you can?
- Not whatever I can.

24:00.973 --> 24:04.141
What are "not" the challenges
I face at amusement parks?

24:04.143 --> 24:07.111
I can't ride half the stuff
because you have to be four foot,

24:07.113 --> 24:09.180
and I'm two inches under.

24:09.182 --> 24:12.450
And then, on top of it, like,
if you play games or something

24:12.452 --> 24:14.318
the counter comes up to here.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.321
So, I'm at a disadvantage.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.456
It's rigged.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.025
It's not fair.

24:21.027 --> 24:24.261
- She's at 40--
- Six inches.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.964
- [woman] She has to be 48.
- Yeah. See.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.499
[Shauna]
I told you, two inches.

24:31.069 --> 24:34.271
- I'm not tall enough.
- She's 3'10".

24:34.273 --> 24:36.907
- Forty-six inches.
- Sorry. She can't get on most of our rides.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.576
- [Mark] Okay.
- Without a companion pass?

24:39.878 --> 24:40.978
[Shauna]
<i>I like roller coasters,</i>

24:40.980 --> 24:43.147
<i>and unfortunately
I can't ride them. [chuckles]</i>

24:43.149 --> 24:47.351
There's been a couple of times where I
just wore wedges and I got away with it.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.388
But I do understand it,
because I've looked into it

24:51.390 --> 24:52.957
and it's a weight thing

24:52.959 --> 24:55.826
and if you're not
the appropriate weight,

24:55.828 --> 24:59.363
you can fall out of the
roller coaster or just fly out,

24:59.365 --> 25:02.199
and I'm okay with not dying.

25:03.401 --> 25:06.804
If I need to make a short
person amusement park, I will.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.839
Folks, come on over,
it's an easy game,

25:08.841 --> 25:10.908
you get one in,
you win a price over here.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.077
- How am I supposed to do this?
- [man] Here we go.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.578
- I don't know, but you gotta--
- [all exclaim]

25:15.313 --> 25:16.480
[man] So close.

25:17.382 --> 25:18.516
[all exclaim]

25:21.386 --> 25:23.120
[all cheer]

25:23.122 --> 25:25.089
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner. Look at that.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.157
Good shot.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.361
You can pick your prize, which one
would you like? Anything over here.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.263
Is there a way
we can get a bigger one

25:32.265 --> 25:34.164
if I do a wager with you?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.332
What do you wanna wager?

25:35.334 --> 25:37.034
All right,
you'll have to guess her age.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.869
- Guess her age?
- Hmm-mmm.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.505
- And if I can't guess, she gets a prize?
- Yeah.

25:42.674 --> 25:45.276
-I don't know. This is gonna be tough.
-[Rylee laughs]

25:48.513 --> 25:50.581
I'm gonna say you're...

25:59.124 --> 26:00.658
You have to guess her age.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.828
-I don't know. This is gonna be tough.
-[Rylee laughs]

26:04.830 --> 26:08.299
I'm gonna say you're... 11.

26:08.301 --> 26:10.534
I was kinda scared
he was gonna get it right.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.937
I was, too.
He seemed very confident.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.972
So I was like,
"He might get this."

26:14.974 --> 26:16.340
But then, what? Did he say 12?

26:16.342 --> 26:18.075
- He said 11.
- Oh, 11.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.143
That's pretty high.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.978
- That is high.
- Yeah.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.213
- Yeah, I talk too much.
- Yeah.

26:23.848 --> 26:24.949
- No.
- Double it.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.250
- Huh?
- Double it.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.519
- Twenty-two? No way!
- Mmm-mmm.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.355
I'm gonna have to see
your driver's license.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.923
I don't have any.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.026
I made a wager, so pick out
another prize. Whatever you like.

26:36.861 --> 26:40.798
I've gotten anywhere
from eight to fourteen.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.901
And most of the time
it's because I do speak.

26:43.903 --> 26:47.037
And if I don't speak
and I just stand there,

26:47.039 --> 26:50.374
depending in what I'm dressed
in, depends on how low they'll go.

26:50.376 --> 26:54.945
I can definitely say, if you put me in
pigtails and dress me kids' clothes,

26:54.947 --> 26:56.413
I might get as low as five.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.082
- Twenty-two?
- Mmm-mmm.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.950
- Wow!
- I know.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.652
- You look good for your age.
- Thank you.

27:01.654 --> 27:02.886
You're welcome.

27:02.888 --> 27:05.456
- Another lucky winner right here.
- [all cheering]

27:06.224 --> 27:09.026
Another lucky winner
going out right there.

27:10.161 --> 27:13.097
So when we came to the park,
it just started raining

27:13.099 --> 27:17.267
and most rides closed down,
so we don't have many options.

27:17.269 --> 27:21.171
[Rylee] The last time I think we
played bumper cars, you got whiplashed.

27:23.074 --> 27:26.043
- [Rylee] Why is she head...
- [Mark] You get to ride with somebody.

27:26.045 --> 27:29.313
- She's just in the like--
- She's in the danger zone.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.081
Yeah, she's in the middle.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.916
When it comes
to amusement parks,

27:32.918 --> 27:36.887
and the adult companion or height
restriction thing, I do understand it.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.089
I hate bumper cars
for this exact reason.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.325
I can't do it, ever.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.161
[Mark] You ride with me,
we'll kick ass.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.196
She's in that red-green zone.

27:48.933 --> 27:51.035
But if I can't ride it,
I'm pissed.

27:51.037 --> 27:55.005
Because it takes way
my sense of independence.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.473
[Patty] Shauna, hold on.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.244
Emotionally,
I'm very independent.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.814
I wouldn't say, like,
I'm fully independent.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.816
I'm working on my independence.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.218
- [machine whirring]
- [bleep].

28:08.220 --> 28:10.954
<i>The things that are
holding me back really are</i>

28:10.956 --> 28:13.857
<i>the finances, the fact that
I can't drive yet.</i>

28:13.859 --> 28:17.961
And my parents need to learn
to loosen the reins,

28:17.963 --> 28:20.030
and I don't know
if my mom will ever do that.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.966
[clamoring]

28:29.541 --> 28:34.678
<i>I think when my parents here
about me talking about independence,</i>

28:34.680 --> 28:37.481
<i>or moving out,
my mom gets worried.</i>

28:37.483 --> 28:42.820
I believe that worrying about
her is a normal parent thing.

28:42.822 --> 28:46.090
Um, but it's elevated.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.092
<i>[Mark] I just worry about her,
you know...</i>

28:49.094 --> 28:50.694
<i>- in the world.
- [Patty] Yeah.</i>

28:50.696 --> 28:54.631
But at the same time, we
want to give her that freedom.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.503
- It's a real tight rope to walk, you know.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.072
I know.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.974
Oh, come on!
That would've been perfect.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.443
Oh, [bleep]!

29:08.279 --> 29:11.215
<i>[Patty] I wanna let her
come and go as she chooses.</i>

29:11.217 --> 29:13.884
But in a bubble. Controlled
circumstances at all times.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.152
I'd like to be in her pocket.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.220
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

29:16.222 --> 29:18.689
- That's the issue.
- What's the issue?

29:19.657 --> 29:22.659
That you wanna be with me 24/7.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.294
I just, I--.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.634
[laughs] No.

29:32.036 --> 29:34.071
- [Tara] Okay, I'm stuck, thanks.
- [Shauna] Okay.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.673
[Tara] Spinning.

29:36.675 --> 29:41.311
<i>[Mark] We also know, you know,
that the world is a harsh place.</i>

29:41.313 --> 29:43.847
And, you know,
it's like you're sending,

29:43.849 --> 29:46.216
like, this little, glass
figurine out into the world

29:46.218 --> 29:48.819
and you don't want it
to get broken.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.654
- Yeah.
- You know, it's very precious.

29:50.656 --> 29:53.924
You just can't ensure
her safety.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.660
But, I know that if anything
happened to her,

29:56.662 --> 30:00.197
I wouldn't be able to,
like, forgive myself.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.634
That was fun.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.904
<i>[Shauna] Given my age, it's
too much worry, in my opinion.</i>

30:06.906 --> 30:09.306
I don't think you
trust me enough

30:09.308 --> 30:11.241
to think I know what I'm doing.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.845
Hmm, I think I trust you,

30:14.847 --> 30:17.147
I don't think you trust me
out in the public.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.683
And that's the issue, you
don't think I can handle myself.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.655
I think you handle yourself.
I think.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.323
- I don't--
- Exactly, I think.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.658
- There you go.
- Well...

30:27.660 --> 30:28.625
End of convo.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.228
[Mark] Oh, you're in the green.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.030
- [Patty] You are in the green.
- [Mark] You're in the green.

30:33.698 --> 30:34.765
Oh!

30:34.767 --> 30:36.200
You doing it?

30:36.202 --> 30:37.367
[Rylee] Mmm-mmm,
that's a death trap.

30:37.802 --> 30:39.436
[Mark laughs]

30:39.438 --> 30:41.138
- [Rylee] Have fun.
- [Mark] This is the card.

30:41.873 --> 30:42.840
All good?

30:42.842 --> 30:45.108
I like this ride.

30:45.110 --> 30:49.313
I don't mind anything I can
do, besides, like, kiddie things.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.214
- [bell rings]
- I don't wanna look down.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.815
[Patty] A little high, isn't it?

30:51.817 --> 30:54.017
- [Tara] I don't like this.
- [Patty] I didn't think we went this high.

30:54.019 --> 30:57.888
-[Tara] No.
-[Patty] Oh, oh, oh, oh. Why am I jumping up and down?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.089
[Tara] I don't know, man.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.424
- [Patty] It's supposed to be
a smooth-- - [Tara screams]

31:03.428 --> 31:06.063
- [Patty] Don't wanna spin.
- [Tara] It's a different spinning, right?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.097
[Patty] Oh, this is a spin!

31:07.099 --> 31:08.432
[Tara] Oh, my God!

31:08.434 --> 31:11.401
A different spinning!
[screams]

31:11.403 --> 31:12.803
[Patty]This is serious spinning!

31:12.805 --> 31:14.237
[Tara] I don't wanna spin
any more!

31:14.239 --> 31:18.008
- [Shauna] I'm getting pelted with rain.
- [Tara] I can't do anything.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.210
[Patty] Maybe I'm
too old for this [bleep].

31:20.212 --> 31:23.180
- I had fun.
- I'm not sure mom and Tara had fun.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.015
- I think they had--
- But, I had fun.

31:25.017 --> 31:28.218
I think they did have fun, I think
it was just too much spinning.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.187
[Rylee] Are you good, Tar?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.288
[Tara] I don't know
where mom is.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.990
She might be vomiting.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.425
<i>[Patty] Gave up my lunch.</i>

31:37.161 --> 31:39.329
[laughing] I gave in
to the spin.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.774
- [Tara] Where are you going?
- [Patty] I guess you're not ready.

31:50.776 --> 31:52.809
She's gonna put on her makeup
or something.

31:52.811 --> 31:56.213
I'm getting all dressed up,
because we're going out to dinner.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.282
<i>I usually don't do
full face makeup.</i>

31:58.284 --> 32:01.685
Um, if I do do makeup, it's usually
just eyeshadow and mascara.

32:01.687 --> 32:07.157
Um, I don't like wearing
a lot of makeup anymore.

32:07.159 --> 32:11.361
I think, whether I'm dressed
up or not, I get attention.

32:11.363 --> 32:15.933
I think when I'm dressed up
and I have makeup on,

32:15.935 --> 32:18.201
my mom gets negative attention.

32:18.203 --> 32:20.737
I don't think it's
any different for me,

32:20.739 --> 32:22.940
I think it's different
for my family.

32:22.942 --> 32:28.979
Shauna likes to dress up,
like any other 22-yoar-old,

32:28.981 --> 32:33.183
but we go out together
and she gets looks, like,

32:33.185 --> 32:36.787
"Oh, wow, what is she doing?
What is that kid doing?"

32:36.789 --> 32:40.190
And then I get the looks
of, "How could you?

32:40.192 --> 32:43.193
How could you let your
child dress like this?"

32:43.195 --> 32:46.129
And then my mom has to
explain that I'm old enough

32:46.131 --> 32:49.433
to make my own decisions and they
don't believe her and they call her a liar.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.269
So, that's not fun.

32:52.337 --> 32:55.706
I feel horrible for my mom, because
I don't deal with all the backlash.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.107
Because they don't
think it's appropriate

32:57.109 --> 32:59.209
to come up to a child
and say these things.

32:59.211 --> 33:02.179
They think it's appropriate for
them to come up to the mother,

33:02.181 --> 33:04.681
which isn't appropriate
at all, in my opinion.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.684
And I know it affects her.

33:07.686 --> 33:11.121
<i>I think she covers
it up very well.</i>

33:11.123 --> 33:14.124
But, I think, like, it's one of
those thoughts in the back...

33:14.126 --> 33:16.860
Like, at the lay of night,
that comes into her head

33:16.862 --> 33:18.662
if someone had commented
on me that day,

33:18.664 --> 33:21.598
she would overthink it,
like, till she fell asleep.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.667
[Patty] I think about them
all the time.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.136
Um...

33:29.440 --> 33:31.141
I don't know why
I'm getting upset.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.377
I know why.

33:34.812 --> 33:37.147
- You know why.
- It's just, um...

33:40.485 --> 33:45.956
I feel so, I guess,
almost guilty,

33:47.692 --> 33:49.960
that she has to...

33:49.962 --> 33:52.729
She will have to go through
this for the rest of her life.

33:52.731 --> 33:57.501
<i>It doesn't seem like
there's going to be a time</i>

33:59.270 --> 34:05.242
that it's just gonna be okay
or it's gonna be normal for her.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.278
- All right, are we ready?
- Can we go?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.679
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

34:09.681 --> 34:10.947
We're out of here.

34:12.283 --> 34:14.017
You're pretty tall,
there, Shauna.

34:14.019 --> 34:16.119
[Shauna] I'm probably,
like, 4'2".

34:16.121 --> 34:18.221
[Patty] You gonna be able
to walk across these pebbles?

34:18.223 --> 34:19.856
- [Shauna inhales] - I am in these
shoes and I don't know if I can.

34:19.858 --> 34:24.861
[Patty] Oh, in, oh, shove it.
On your toes in those things.

34:24.863 --> 34:28.865
Restaurants can't ever seem to
understand fully that I'm an adult.

34:28.867 --> 34:32.469
If you guys need anything, just let me
know. The kids' menu is on the third page.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.704
I thought that maybe
she was around 10 years old.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.840
Can I have a mango margarita?

34:36.842 --> 34:38.542
I've been around Shauna
when she's drunk.

34:38.544 --> 34:39.576
<i>[Patty] Oh, that's fun.</i>

34:39.578 --> 34:43.346
Everyone besides you all
thinks I'm a fun drunk.

34:43.348 --> 34:46.183
- Go on, Shauna.
- [Rylee] Chug, chug, chug, chug.

34:48.352 --> 34:49.986
[upbeat music playing]

34:53.658 --> 34:55.459
[Mark] Ooh, he's got
a good dental plan.

34:55.461 --> 34:58.295
[Tara] Yeah, he has a nice
behind but not the front-hind.

35:02.834 --> 35:06.069
Restaurants, specifically...

35:06.071 --> 35:09.873
can't ever seem to
understand fully that I'm an adult.

35:09.875 --> 35:13.310
And it... It starts
from the minute we walk in.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.580
- [Patty] What do you want to drink?
- [Tara] Oh, I don't have mine.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.715
[Shauna] Do you have your Excelsior
Pass that has your birthday on it?

35:18.717 --> 35:20.450
I don't have my wallet.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.419
- Hey, guys, how you doing today?
- [Mark] Howdy.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.221
-[Patty] Good, how are you?
-I'm doing good. My name's Sandy.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.856
I'll be taking care of youse.

35:25.858 --> 35:29.292
If you guys need anything, just let me
know. The kids' menu is on the third page.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.795
Okay? I'm gonna be... Grab you some
chips and salsa and I'll be right back.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.063
- [Mark] Thanks.
- [Sandy] Mmm-hmm.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.865
They're like, "Okay,
you want one kids' menu?"

35:34.867 --> 35:37.968
And Rylee's like, "Yeah,
for me. Not for her, for me."

35:37.970 --> 35:41.338
But they'll still automatically
bring me a kid's cup,

35:41.340 --> 35:44.107
or they'll automatically try
to put me in the booster seat.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.509
- There you go.
- [Rylee] Thank you.

35:45.511 --> 35:46.977
- You're welcome.
- [Mark] Thank you.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.146
- Are we all set for some drinks?
- [Mark] Yeah.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.681
Could I have a...
the pineapple margarita,

35:51.683 --> 35:53.250
but can I have a water as well.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.517
Okay, pineapple...

35:54.519 --> 35:59.189
- Can I have a mango margarita?
- Mango margarita, babe? Okay.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.892
When I first saw them,
I was just thinking...

36:01.894 --> 36:04.094
It's just a normal family,
just going out for dinner.

36:04.096 --> 36:06.696
<i>I thought that maybe
she was around 10 years old.</i>

36:06.698 --> 36:10.767
But she did order alcoholic beverages,
[chuckles] and she was a little tiny.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.670
- Can I just have IDs real quick? Thank you.
- [Tara] Oh, I don't have it.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.272
- So, nevermind.
- [Sandy] You don't have ID? Okay.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.674
- No, I don't have my ID.
- [Shauna] I mean, she's older than me.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.210
[Sandy] Thank you, babe. Do you
mind if I scan it real quick? Okay.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.279
- I'll be right back, okay?
- [Mark] Can I have a--

36:22.281 --> 36:23.413
[all laughing]

36:24.148 --> 36:26.149
- [Sandy] Sorry.
- [Mark laughs]

36:26.151 --> 36:27.751
If you told me
she was actually 22,

36:27.753 --> 36:29.152
I would have been
a little shocked.

36:29.154 --> 36:32.489
Yeah, especially 'cause... Just
her height and her little voice.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.724
- [Sandy] ...and your margarita.
- Thank you.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.693
You're welcome.

36:36.695 --> 36:40.096
When Shauna orders a drink,
all of the eyes are on Shauna.

36:40.098 --> 36:42.899
<i>It's like, "Why is she
able to have a drink?"</i>

36:42.901 --> 36:44.501
"What's different about her?"

36:44.503 --> 36:45.802
- [Shauna cheering]
- [Patty] Yay.

36:45.804 --> 36:46.970
[Mark] And here we go.

36:46.972 --> 36:50.040
When I'm out with my friends
and we're drinking,

36:50.042 --> 36:52.709
there's definitely people
who do double takes.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.346
And I... I... I don't really
pay attention anymore.

36:56.348 --> 36:59.749
- [Mark] What colors are your wedding?
- [Tara] Blue and purple.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.984
Yeah.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.353
You're looking for, like, a
formal type thing? More casual--

37:03.355 --> 37:05.322
- [Shauna] No, they want a
barn-- - [Tara] It's a wedding!

37:05.324 --> 37:07.090
They either want
a barn or a castle.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.124
[Tara] You dress up.
Suit and tie.

37:08.126 --> 37:11.194
How do you do barn or
castle? How does... How...

37:11.196 --> 37:13.230
- Tara said if they have-- - [Tara]
I like the barn, he likes the castle.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.198
[Mark] Wedding's supposed
to be about the woman.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.267
[Tara] That's not fair.

37:17.334 --> 37:19.536
- [Mark] It is fair.
- I don't think that's fair at all.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.137
[Mark] 'Cause he's the one
who's getting the prize.

37:21.706 --> 37:22.872
[Shauna] You're
the prize, dummy.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.175
- [Tara] I don't like to be itemized.
- Tara, he has had

37:25.177 --> 37:28.144
four weddings,
I think he would know.

37:28.146 --> 37:31.081
- [Shauna laughing] - But they didn't
work out, so I think he wouldn't know.

37:32.016 --> 37:34.851
[laughing] Okay.

37:34.853 --> 37:38.154
- Are you guys looking for houses in Tallahassee?
- They have a house.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.990
- [Mark] No, they--
- No, we're renting.

37:39.992 --> 37:40.857
[Mark] Are you gonna buy?

37:40.859 --> 37:43.126
- [Tara] Yeah, we're buying.
- There?

37:43.128 --> 37:44.995
Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna
be there for five years.

37:44.997 --> 37:48.131
Tara currently lives in
Florida with her fiance, Jesse,

37:48.133 --> 37:49.933
<i>while she's getting her PhD.</i>

37:49.935 --> 37:52.969
And I do have intentions
of moving out on my own,

37:52.971 --> 37:55.438
<i>but I might wanna move in
with other people</i>

37:56.040 --> 37:57.073
that I consider friends.

37:57.075 --> 37:59.042
<i>Maybe Rylee and I
move out together.</i>

37:59.044 --> 38:01.211
<i>But my parents
are very coddle-y,</i>

38:01.213 --> 38:06.149
and they have to let go a little so they
can see that I'm becoming independent.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.051
<i>[Patty] All I can do...</i>

38:09.687 --> 38:13.290
Is do what she says I do, and
that's coddle her and protect her.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.424
And, um...

38:16.327 --> 38:19.195
- You don't-- - Try and
give her the best life I can

38:19.197 --> 38:20.530
and do everything for her.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.699
- [sighs]
- So...

38:24.502 --> 38:27.370
How else... How else
are you supposed to feel?

38:28.105 --> 38:29.706
You feel that...

38:29.708 --> 38:32.175
something bad happened
to your daughter,

38:32.177 --> 38:35.245
you helped her get through it,
and you help her get on with her life.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.282
- I'm working on it.
- She's working on it.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.052
- [Mark] Everybody's done?
- [Tara] Yes.

38:42.054 --> 38:43.353
- [Rylee] Yes.
- [Mark] Everybody feels good?

38:43.355 --> 38:44.854
I better start right now.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.090
- [Shauna] I knew she was gonna take mine!
- [all laughing]

38:47.092 --> 38:49.826
- Chug, chug, chug...
- [Shauna chanting] Chug it!

38:49.828 --> 38:51.895
- [Tara] Yeah, slurp it.
- [Rylee] Chug, chug, chug.

38:51.897 --> 38:55.098
- [Mark] Chug, chug, chug.
- You'll get a powerful hit in the straw,

38:55.100 --> 38:58.234
I'm not sure how many drinks
it takes to get me drunk.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.303
<i>It... It really depends
on the day, I think.</i>

39:00.305 --> 39:02.205
<i>It might be,
like, three glasses.</i>

39:02.207 --> 39:05.141
- I've been around Shauna when she's drunk.
- Oh, that's fun.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.209
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, yeah.

39:06.211 --> 39:07.977
- She's hilarious.
- That's fun.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.313
- [imitates Shauna] I just tell
the truth! [laughs] - [chuckles]

39:10.315 --> 39:13.316
-"You're ugly!" [chuckles] -"You
don't like it? Sucks to be you!"

39:13.318 --> 39:16.119
[imitates Shauna] If I'm being
honest, I'm the pretty sister.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.055
-[giggles] -"Everyone tells
me I'm... Oh, I think I fell!"

39:19.057 --> 39:20.323
[Mark] There you go.
Go on, Shauna.

39:20.325 --> 39:22.592
- [Tara giggling] - [Rylee
chanting] Chug, chug, chug.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.894
- [Tara] Oh, my God. Lame.
- [Mark] Aw.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.029
[Shauna] Chug it down.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.664
- You're a mean drunk.
- Very mean.

39:27.666 --> 39:31.267
No. Everyone besides you all
thinks I'm a fun drunk.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.670
- But you're rude.
- Okay. They're lying.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.106
'Cause they like seeing you
mean to other people.

39:36.108 --> 39:37.974
- That's funny for them.
- Or... Or...

39:37.976 --> 39:41.244
Maybe I actually like them and
probably secretly hate you all.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.279
- I don't think it's secret.
- [chuckling]

39:43.281 --> 39:45.348
- You definitely-- - Yeah, you don't
make it a secret when you're drunk.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.183
You make that
very open. [laughs]

39:47.185 --> 39:48.451
- [Mark] Let's head out.
- All right.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.220
- We're out of here.
- [Mark] All right.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.922
- [Shauna] Oh, [bleep].
- [all laughing]

39:52.924 --> 39:54.958
The things I need to do
to be more independent

39:54.960 --> 39:57.327
are drive, I need to start
looking at places,

39:57.329 --> 39:59.896
I need to become
more financially stable.

39:59.898 --> 40:03.333
But I knew my life was
different from a very young age,

40:03.335 --> 40:07.003
and that there are just certain kind
of steps I have to take in between.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.405
The big steps. Because...

40:09.273 --> 40:11.341
I mean, this might be
a pun, but I'm short,

40:11.343 --> 40:13.676
<i>and you gotta take small steps.</i>

40:13.678 --> 40:17.747
And it's... It's now's the time to
start working on my independence.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.349
- [Mark] Well, that was fun.
- [Shauna] Eh.

40:19.351 --> 40:22.485
[Patty] That was a blast. Don't do
that. Then why would you... "Eh."

40:23.120 --> 40:24.220
"Eh."

40:26.590 --> 40:29.325
[Patty] Hey. Uh-uh.
[chuckles] Uh-uh.
