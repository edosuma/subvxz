WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:06.560
He's the most handsome and
coolest guy in all of third year.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.560
I think we're going to sleep together.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.520
I like it.
I think it's a little hot.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.020
You! Don't be a dick tease.

00:14.020 --> 00:17.280
Ingrid...
I miss you.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.580
You look like a slut.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.400
I'm not going behind
your back and talking to Ingrid.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.220
Where are you?
-I can't come.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.620
Who was that?

00:26.940 --> 00:28.200
Jonas!

00:28.200 --> 00:30.940
Sorry, I have to go.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.480
Hello.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.040
Hi.

00:51.940 --> 00:53.080
Sad?

00:53.240 --> 00:54.260
No!

00:55.100 --> 00:56.240
I bought coffee for you!

00:56.800 --> 00:58.040
Thanks.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.280
What should we talk about?

01:04.780 --> 01:07.620
Nothing. It's just nice to have coffee.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.100
What did you do on the weekend?

01:10.260 --> 01:13.020
Eh... Nothing.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.220
What did you do on Friday?

01:17.900 --> 01:19.520
Mom had her birthday.

01:19.940 --> 01:21.680
So you were just home?

01:22.020 --> 01:22.900
Yeah!

01:23.420 --> 01:25.120
Did something happen on Friday?

01:25.220 --> 01:26.840
No, I was just wondering what you did.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.680
I think that maybe
Jonas was with Ingrid.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.060
Do you know anything about it?

01:44.420 --> 01:45.380
No.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.180
Why do you think so?

01:48.080 --> 01:51.100
I talked on the phone with
him and heard her voice in the background.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.160
Did you ask him?

01:53.240 --> 01:55.360
Yeah, but he said it was his sister.

01:56.120 --> 01:56.840
Maybe it was.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.480
I know Ingrid's voice.
We've been best friends for four years.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.900
Say that to him.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.180
I did, but he got really mad
and said that I didn't trust him.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.840
Eva, why are you with him?

02:25.260 --> 02:26.640
What do you mean?

02:26.960 --> 02:33.100
Jonas is my bro, but why
are you with someone you don't trust?

02:39.540 --> 02:41.420
So do you think I should trust him?

02:42.380 --> 02:45.400
Or you could go for option three.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.080
You could ask Ingrid.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.040
I'll soon see William again.

03:03.360 --> 03:09.480
I think we have something going on,
but the age difference is quite big.

03:09.620 --> 03:12.880
There could really be something between us.

03:12.920 --> 03:20.980
He said he thinks I'm really special.
And I'm ready for it.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.160
Did I tell you I had an orgasm?

03:23.820 --> 03:25.360
<i>[Smile.]</i>

03:25.960 --> 03:27.080
How was that?

03:27.080 --> 03:27.420
<i>[Smile yourself.]</i>
How was that?

03:27.420 --> 03:28.240
<i>[Smile yourself.]</i>

03:28.240 --> 03:28.440
It was a bit like
a sneeze. Just down there.
<i>[Smile yourself.]</i>

03:28.440 --> 03:32.020
It was a bit like
a sneeze. Just down there.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.140
Like a sneeze?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.200
Hm-hm.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.420
<i>[I am smiling.]</i>

03:38.800 --> 03:41.620
I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.280
<i>[You're angry.]</i>
I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

03:43.340 --> 03:44.560
Yeah, why is that?

03:45.040 --> 03:46.900
Because he was really big.

03:47.180 --> 03:50.680
You can't go around telling
people about his dick.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.400
Why not?

03:53.360 --> 03:57.300
You're asking why you can't tell people
about his most vulnerable body part?

03:58.380 --> 04:02.400
Firstly, that body part
wasn't that vulnerable.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.540
And secondly, he'll surely talk
about my body to his friends.

04:07.620 --> 04:10.080
Girls should also
be able to do that.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.640
I support equality and feminism.

04:14.180 --> 04:18.620
But Vilde, firstly, size doesn't
have anything to do with orgasms.

04:18.620 --> 04:25.040
And secondly, just because guys are fools,
doesn't mean we have to be fools as well.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.220
It doesn't have anything
to do with equality at all.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.520
Whatever...

04:31.260 --> 04:34.980
But it was good, then?
That's the most important part.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.660
It was really good.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.080
But, there's just one thing.

04:41.620 --> 04:46.460
There's no one who tells you
it practically runs out again.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.200
You didn't use a condom?

04:48.480 --> 04:51.440
No, he said he tends not to use one.
-Vilde!

04:52.440 --> 04:54.360
What the fuck is that?

05:15.140 --> 05:18.200
Where are those from?
-Sana knows someone.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.380
It's to fetch the toilet paper.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.460
But I need payment first.
-That's not how it works.

05:23.460 --> 05:29.960
He receives payment from his people,
and then you can pay your people.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.400
But I don't have "people".

05:34.840 --> 05:37.340
Do you think MasterCard
operates without people?

05:49.180 --> 05:50.320
Hello.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.520
Hi!
-Hello.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.380
Are you guys coming
to the Halloween party on Friday?

05:56.420 --> 05:58.060
Yeah, maybe.
-We're coming!

05:59.140 --> 06:00.980
Good. We'll talk.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.680
Bye!

06:16.280 --> 06:17.940
You smell like smoke.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.700
What's up, Eva?

06:33.620 --> 06:35.240
This doesn't bother me...

06:42.000 --> 06:43.940
I think there's something
between you and Ingrid.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.700
Really?

06:47.300 --> 06:49.220
You still think so?

06:49.220 --> 06:52.820
I know I heard her voice on the phone!

06:52.820 --> 06:55.620
For the last time, that was my sister
talking in the background!

06:55.640 --> 06:59.040
Why would she be talking in the background?
-Because she thought it was my mom!

06:59.520 --> 07:01.280
Wasn't your mom at home?

07:02.140 --> 07:03.480
Jonas!

07:03.480 --> 07:07.040
You said you would help
your mom with something at home.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.677
But your mom wasn't even home?

07:09.702 --> 07:13.664
No, she came home later.
That's why I called.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.720
Why are you lying to me?
-I'm not lying!

07:25.080 --> 07:26.680
This is not working.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.780
It isn't working?

07:33.680 --> 07:35.280
What do you mean by that?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.180
Do you want a break or something?

07:43.340 --> 07:46.240
That's what you want.
-No, that's not what I want!

07:46.360 --> 07:50.140
Stop being so
insecure all the time.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.220
What's up with you? Why aren't you
listening to me? I want to talk to you.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.320
Can't you get to
the point? Just admit it!

09:15.280 --> 09:20.320
I got a glass of water and...
He's a guy who only looks-

09:20.320 --> 09:22.160
How's it going with
the alcohol for the party?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.800
I sent William a message
if he could get it for us.

09:24.825 --> 09:25.904
Can he?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.540
He hasn't replied yet.

09:27.565 --> 09:30.960
He's extremely busy. He's in the
third year, and he's the bus boss.

09:30.960 --> 09:37.200
He has so much to think about.
We haven't talked properly since last time.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.200
But we do keep in
contact via. Snapchat.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.160
You know what I did yesterday?

09:43.420 --> 09:44.520
No?

09:44.820 --> 09:46.640
I sent William a topless picture.

09:48.740 --> 09:49.900
What did you do?

09:49.960 --> 09:54.760
They're just boobs.
William likes confident girls.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.110
What did he reply?

09:56.135 --> 10:00.184
He didn't reply directly,
but he took a screenshot.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.520
Now listen, Einstein.

10:03.620 --> 10:04.980
William is not interested.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.100
How do you know?
-He didn't even reply to a topless picture.

10:09.500 --> 10:16.240
In "The Game" it says that boys
don't reply to make girls more interested.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.097
If I were you, I would
put down "The Game"

10:18.122 --> 10:20.885
and start reading "He's
Just Not That Into You".

10:24.960 --> 10:27.060
Why are you always so mean?

10:36.420 --> 10:37.640
Hello?!

10:38.200 --> 10:43.460
We are her friends. If we don't
tell her the truth, who will?

10:43.600 --> 10:49.600
She's sending topless pictures
to a guy who is lying to sleep with her.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.760
That's mean!
-You don't know if he's lying!

10:52.880 --> 10:56.540
He doesn't really seem
like the most trustworthy guy.

10:58.080 --> 11:02.580
I mean that you can't just claim
people are lying without having proof.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.320
Sometimes you have to trust people.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.320
Everyone knows that guys lie.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.700
And how do you know that?
-Their stories are inconsistent.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.840
They get mad when you ask.
Afterwards, they get a bad conscience...

11:14.840 --> 11:16.840
and they start drowning you in compliments.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.580
Believe me, just wait and see.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.680
William will break her heart.

12:23.500 --> 12:29.340
<i>[You know you're the coolest, best, hottest,
funniest, prettiest girl in the whole world? I love you.]</i>

12:49.480 --> 12:52.980
Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.200
Last Friday?

12:57.360 --> 13:00.300
Yeah! Yeah, I was with Jonas.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.160
He didn't tell you?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.060
Oops.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.220
Fuck you!

13:11.460 --> 13:14.040
No, fuck you Eva. Fuck you!

13:28.160 --> 13:36.400
<i>[I talked to Ingrid and she told me EVERYTHING!]</i>

14:11.760 --> 14:13.220
You're sitting here?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.580
I'm sitting here.

14:18.700 --> 14:21.640
Someone's obviously trying to reach you.
-Yeah.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.020
Who is Jonas?

14:26.880 --> 14:28.160
My boyfriend.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.280
Or, eh...

14:31.920 --> 14:33.900
You don't know if he's your boyfriend, or?

14:33.900 --> 14:36.320
He is my boyfriend, it's just that...

14:37.940 --> 14:39.440
We're having a fight.

14:44.660 --> 14:46.000
Hey, you...

14:49.580 --> 14:50.860
Fuck him.

14:54.740 --> 14:58.340
If he makes such a
nice girl cry, fuck him.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.620
This can't happen.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.240
There you are.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.600
What are you guys doing?

15:39.600 --> 15:45.280
Eva's fighting with her boyfriend.
Have you met Eva?

15:47.020 --> 15:50.540
Eva, this is Iben.
My girlfriend.

15:53.820 --> 15:58.740
You shouldn't be talking to me.
Iben's really good with boyfriend trouble.

15:59.340 --> 16:02.760
She's fighting with her boyfriend.
-Ah, poor you.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.940
I'll give you two some time.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.400
I'm fine, really.
You don't need to-

16:15.520 --> 16:17.980
Believe me, I know what it's like.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.235
You're a first year.

16:20.260 --> 16:26.364
When people try to figure out who
they are, and they change a lot.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.480
People might not be
the way you thought they were.

16:31.720 --> 16:37.940
The same goes for boyfriends. When I was in
the first year my boyfriend was an asshole.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.340
He cheated five
times without me knowing about it.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.840
It gets better when you get older.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.667
It's going really well
between me and Christoffer,

16:51.692 --> 16:53.940
because third year
guys are more mature.

16:53.940 --> 16:58.380
We can talk about everything,
and I trust him 110%.

16:58.380 --> 17:01.920
You'll get a more mature
relationship, if you know what I mean.

17:05.940 --> 17:08.300
Are you also in the third year?

17:08.300 --> 17:11.960
No, second. But a lot happens
from your first to your second year.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.460
Don't take relationships so seriously.

17:16.600 --> 17:21.740
Think of it as something temporary.
Don't let him stand in your way.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.145
It's Halloween!

17:24.170 --> 17:26.139
There's a really
cool party here.

17:26.164 --> 17:28.828
And you're sitting here
like a sad ballerina.

17:30.700 --> 17:31.840
Don't you agree?

17:33.820 --> 17:36.360
Come on, let's go.
Let's have an awesome time.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.080
Thanks, you're really kind...

17:40.320 --> 17:45.760
But I don't feel too good,
so I think I might go home.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.580
Are you sure?

17:48.480 --> 17:49.780
Really sure?

17:51.560 --> 17:53.400
It'll get better.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.560
Black Swan?

19:41.260 --> 19:43.220
I can't handle us breaking up.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.320
The thing is that
Ingrid's brother is a dealer.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.460
Dealer of what?
-Greens.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.640
Have you started smoking marijuana?

20:05.060 --> 20:06.460
Huh?

20:09.180 --> 20:10.400
Why?

20:11.240 --> 20:15.180
You're reacting as if it was heroin.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.160
Marijuana is a drug.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.660
So you think it's equally
as dangerous as heroin?

20:19.685 --> 20:21.224
Yes!

20:27.060 --> 20:31.020
I was at Ingrid's brother's
place to buy stuff.

20:31.260 --> 20:35.920
Ingrid showed up. But she lives there,
so I couldn't say anything to you.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.912
Why didn't you say
anything to me?

20:41.937 --> 20:45.028
Seriously? Did you see
your reaction just now?

20:51.560 --> 20:56.320
Anyway, my point is that there's
nothing between me and Ingrid.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.900
And there never
will be anything, either.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.080
It was really dumb of me to lie.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.100
The fact that you believe there was...

21:09.900 --> 21:13.320
That really hurt me.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.300
Because I trust you 100%.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.940
You have to start trusting me.

21:28.200 --> 21:34.640
I would never do
anything that could destroy us.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.060
Because it's us.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.360
Right?

21:54.840 --> 21:55.920
Don't cry.
