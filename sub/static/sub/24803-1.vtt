[organ music ends]

01:52.703 --> 01:54.871
What the fuck
you doin' here?

01:55.505 --> 01:56.540
Where's Irina?

01:57.740 --> 01:59.510
She sent me instead.

02:00.210 --> 02:01.779
Let's look at the package.

02:23.767 --> 02:27.605
Give this to Irina,
and don't fuck it up.

02:53.829 --> 02:56.566
[liquid sloshing in mixing cup]

03:24.361 --> 03:26.297
It's about fuckin' time.
Where the hell you been?

03:26.762 --> 03:27.931
- I was at church.
- Oh.

03:28.764 --> 03:30.166
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, darling.

03:32.202 --> 03:33.234
How'd it go?

03:33.236 --> 03:34.772
- [woman] Hmm.
- [man] Ooh.

03:35.005 --> 03:36.040
I see it went well.

03:36.739 --> 03:38.907
- Irina will be pleased.
- Very.

03:38.909 --> 03:41.745
- Fancy a bump?
- Just a tiny one.

03:42.713 --> 03:46.617
Maybe I'll borrow a little cash.
Irina won't miss a grand or two.

03:51.088 --> 03:52.790
[liquid pouring]

04:04.167 --> 04:05.202
May I?

04:08.304 --> 04:10.740
[orchestral music playing]

04:44.341 --> 04:46.077
[clattering]

04:49.913 --> 04:51.349
[gunshot]

05:12.435 --> 05:14.005
[beads clattering]

05:21.812 --> 05:23.247
[cash register rings]

06:28.878 --> 06:30.213
[music ends]

06:41.390 --> 06:42.358
[woman] Psst!

06:45.829 --> 06:47.498
- Psst!
- [sipping]

06:48.832 --> 06:50.201
- Psst!
- Ahh...

06:50.901 --> 06:51.969
Psst!

06:54.070 --> 06:55.171
Psst!

06:58.041 --> 06:59.310
Hi there, handsome.

07:01.945 --> 07:03.481
What's your name, sexy?

07:05.115 --> 07:06.150
Fuck off.

07:07.483 --> 07:08.853
All right, mate.

07:10.587 --> 07:12.255
All right, mate.

07:16.192 --> 07:17.995
- Oi, Harry.
- [moans]

07:19.829 --> 07:23.099
- [sighs] Have we landed?
- No, we haven't fuckin' landed.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.137
I'm being accosted
by a tanning booth.

07:28.938 --> 07:30.974
This flight's
a fuckin' nightmare.

07:32.041 --> 07:35.378
I've been abused,
and I've paid for the privilege.

07:37.613 --> 07:39.382
Why do we have to go
to Los Angeles?

07:40.349 --> 07:42.549
It's the safest place
we could possibly be.

07:42.551 --> 07:45.887
I mean, she'll be looking for us
in every hotel bar in London.

07:45.889 --> 07:46.924
Oh, she'll do.

07:47.524 --> 07:51.095
She'll hunt us down.
She'll find us.

07:51.995 --> 07:53.364
She'll torture us.

07:53.997 --> 07:55.032
Me first.

07:55.932 --> 07:57.268
She's never liked me
for some reason.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.204
Here. Take this.
You'll feel much better.

08:03.906 --> 08:06.043
- [man] What was that?
- I don't know.

08:07.077 --> 08:09.077
- Xanax, possibly.
- Oh, right.

08:09.079 --> 08:10.981
[slow guitar music]

08:27.329 --> 08:28.565
[man]
<i>Los Angeles is horrible.</i>

08:30.200 --> 08:34.269
It's like a theme park
built on a fault line.

08:34.270 --> 08:35.272
Shh!

08:35.671 --> 08:39.142
No, no.
[chuckles] Right.

08:40.275 --> 08:41.311
Bye, love.

08:42.544 --> 08:44.080
Oh, yeah,
who was that then?

08:45.614 --> 08:47.417
Now, darling,
don't get upset.

08:48.017 --> 08:49.887
It was Sidney, wasn't it?
I might have known.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.424
- He's an old friend.
- He's an evil old pederast.

08:54.089 --> 08:56.290
[man] <i>If we're gonna see Sidney,
I need a fuckin' drink.</i>

08:56.292 --> 08:58.061
<i>I'm as dry
as a schoolgirl's knickers.</i>

09:01.330 --> 09:03.600
[bell tolling]

09:31.695 --> 09:33.063
Once again,

09:33.964 --> 09:37.233
I'm being asked to prostitute myself
for the sake of a criminal venture.

09:37.599 --> 09:41.070
All I'm asking is that you take
one for the team, all right?

09:41.704 --> 09:44.608
It's your own fault for being
so bloody beautiful, isn't it?

09:46.475 --> 09:50.010
- Here. Take this.
- I already took one.

09:50.012 --> 09:51.514
- Take another one.
- All right.

09:53.016 --> 09:55.685
And take one of these.

09:57.052 --> 09:58.087
All right.

10:00.656 --> 10:03.227
[organ music playing]

10:08.297 --> 10:10.333
Go in peace, my child.

10:12.701 --> 10:15.702
[footsteps echoing]

10:15.704 --> 10:18.075
[chuckling]

10:18.675 --> 10:21.679
- Well, well, let me drink you in.
- [Harry] Sidney.

10:22.579 --> 10:27.984
My dear, dear Harry.
And, my own boy.

10:28.283 --> 10:32.488
[chuckles] Oh, my. Haven't
we been filling out, hmm?

10:33.022 --> 10:36.356
When I think back to how scrawny
you were when we first met.

10:36.358 --> 10:40.196
Like a little bird, a fledgling.
And now, look at you.

10:40.597 --> 10:41.999
Proud cock.

10:42.799 --> 10:45.132
I do hope you've forgiven
your Uncle Sidney

10:45.134 --> 10:47.370
for that little mishap
in Turkey?

10:48.037 --> 10:50.440
I couldn't bear to think of you
being angry with me.

10:50.672 --> 10:54.377
Of course he's forgiven you.
It was only for a few months.

10:54.676 --> 11:00.149
I can't even imagine the horrors you
were subjected to in that sordid jail.

11:00.483 --> 11:05.155
I want you to tell me all about it.
Every little detail, hmm?

11:05.354 --> 11:07.422
All the ins and outs.

11:07.424 --> 11:10.127
[Harry]
Sidney? We need a word.

11:11.493 --> 11:13.329
Yes. This way, my pets.

11:19.401 --> 11:22.272
- [Harry] He's new.
- Yes, the last one split.

11:27.142 --> 11:31.714
[Sidney] You know, I don't think I've seen
you since Istanbul. It's been an age.

11:32.181 --> 11:34.247
What have you been doing
with yourself?

11:34.249 --> 11:37.217
Well, you know,
this and that.

11:37.219 --> 11:41.524
Import, export.
A little poker. How are you?

11:42.092 --> 11:44.158
Oh, much the same.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.796
Still battling
this interminable ennui.

11:47.196 --> 11:50.564
You know, life is simply
insupportable without you, Harry.

11:50.566 --> 11:52.568
- Well, I'm back.
- So I see.

11:53.136 --> 11:55.539
- Staying with us long, I hope?
- Fuck, no.

11:56.439 --> 11:58.242
- That depends.
- [knock on door]

11:58.541 --> 11:59.709
[door opens]

12:01.276 --> 12:04.214
- A package has arrived.
- Thank you, Kim Kim.

12:05.415 --> 12:06.450
Sidney...

12:07.550 --> 12:09.620
- We need some work.
- [man] And money.

12:10.219 --> 12:13.056
- Shed loads of money.
- So I heard.

12:13.522 --> 12:15.691
How much do you owe Irina,
in fact?

12:16.158 --> 12:17.858
So you know about it, do you?

12:17.860 --> 12:20.294
[chuckling] Yes.

12:20.296 --> 12:22.462
She is making
rather a fuss, you know.

12:22.464 --> 12:25.234
[Harry]
Is she? I can't imagine why.

12:25.468 --> 12:28.535
[scoffs] I borrowed a little
from her at poker.

12:28.537 --> 12:31.441
Nothing, really.
You know how it is.

12:31.741 --> 12:34.211
[lounge music playing]

13:20.190 --> 13:22.159
[pound notes rustling]

13:42.211 --> 13:43.779
[music ends]

13:45.848 --> 13:48.318
[ominous music playing]

13:58.594 --> 13:59.729
[shot glass shatters]

14:35.765 --> 14:38.335
- Where is she?
- Get us some drinks, luv?

14:39.002 --> 14:41.001
- Drink?
- Yeah. Get us a round of drinks.

14:41.003 --> 14:42.535
- Yeah, you want?
- Yeah.

14:42.537 --> 14:43.839
Okay. I get.

14:44.306 --> 14:46.342
[people screaming]

14:49.411 --> 14:52.315
[surf guitar music playing]

15:03.925 --> 15:05.362
[door opens]

15:08.031 --> 15:10.434
- [door closes]
- [engine revs]

15:15.570 --> 15:17.837
Irina put a price
on your head.

15:17.839 --> 15:19.843
You were aware of that,
I take it?

15:20.075 --> 15:21.444
I never knew she cared.

15:22.344 --> 15:25.449
Oh, I think we can both agree that
that just isn't true, is it, darling?

15:26.315 --> 15:28.816
And as for you.
You're a very naughty boy.

15:28.818 --> 15:32.022
I have a good mind to put you over my
knee and give you a very sound spanking.

15:32.789 --> 15:37.427
But as it is, I do have a small amount
of opium that needs delivering.

15:37.826 --> 15:39.526
Really? How small?

15:39.528 --> 15:40.930
Oh, uh...

15:42.431 --> 15:43.399
A comfortable amount.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.769
- [Harry] We'll do it for 50.
- [Sidney] Thirty-five.

15:47.070 --> 15:48.037
Forty.

15:49.805 --> 15:53.844
[sighs] I'm so weak.
Because I love you, Harry.

15:55.945 --> 15:58.949
The, uh, usual method,
do you think?

15:59.648 --> 16:00.750
Of course.

16:03.485 --> 16:04.520
Gorgeous.

16:05.088 --> 16:06.456
I'm not doing it.

16:07.924 --> 16:10.060
Certainly not
for 40 fuckin' grand.

16:10.759 --> 16:12.860
I mean it. I'm not doing it.

16:12.862 --> 16:14.595
[sighs]
We need the money, darling.

16:14.597 --> 16:16.364
I've had so many things
stuffed up my ass,

16:16.366 --> 16:18.531
I might as well get a boyfriend
and move to San Francisco.

16:18.533 --> 16:21.804
Don't be such a baby. It'll
be over before you know it.

16:22.537 --> 16:24.774
Quite frankly,
we have no fucking choice.

16:29.411 --> 16:30.747
[Irina]
<i>Where is she?</i>

16:31.680 --> 16:32.849
[man]
<i>I've not seen her in months.</i>

16:35.818 --> 16:38.388
Don't fuckin' lie to me.

16:39.055 --> 16:40.089
I am not.

16:42.992 --> 16:45.362
That bitch still owes me.

16:47.463 --> 16:49.599
Money.
From a game in Hackney.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.369
When you find her,
you can tell her that.

16:53.902 --> 16:56.406
[telephone ringing]

17:00.542 --> 17:03.110
- Yes?
- Irina, my angel.

17:03.112 --> 17:04.778
[speaking Russian]

17:04.780 --> 17:05.748
<i>How are you?</i>

17:06.015 --> 17:07.883
[sighs] What do you want?

17:08.116 --> 17:11.686
Well, it's been such
a long time, hasn't it?

17:11.953 --> 17:16.692
I'd been meaning to call you up and
have a nice little chat with you.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.194
But where does time go, hmm?
Where do you think?

17:20.195 --> 17:23.163
Sidney, I'm busy.

17:23.165 --> 17:24.867
<i>Well, this won't take long.</i>

17:25.634 --> 17:27.700
I understand that you're
looking for a certain person,

17:27.702 --> 17:30.673
and that you're prepared
to pay a very handsome price.

17:31.606 --> 17:32.642
Hold on.

17:35.577 --> 17:36.412
[grunts]

17:40.482 --> 17:41.515
[clears throat]

17:41.517 --> 17:42.552
Talk to me.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.988
[jazz music playing]

17:47.457 --> 17:48.825
[Harry]
<i>We need a hotel.</i>

17:49.525 --> 17:51.762
[man] <i>We need a better
plan than drugs up my bum.</i>

17:57.999 --> 18:00.770
- Welcome to the Chateau Marmont.
- Thank you.

18:06.709 --> 18:07.842
- [grunts]
- [tires screech]

18:07.844 --> 18:08.678
Stop! Stop!

18:09.745 --> 18:12.146
- Oh, my God! I am...
- You nearly killed him!

18:12.148 --> 18:14.117
- I am so sorry.
- Darling, are you all right?

18:14.549 --> 18:16.816
- He could've killed me.
- Where's the manager?

18:16.818 --> 18:18.888
Uh, this way, please.
I...

18:22.892 --> 18:24.691
I only hope this suite
goes some way

18:24.693 --> 18:26.896
towards making up
for this unfortunate accident.

18:27.196 --> 18:28.432
It'll do.

18:29.131 --> 18:31.567
And call a doctor.

18:32.235 --> 18:34.968
- I need some painkillers.
- [man] Right away, sir.

18:34.970 --> 18:38.639
Send us a personal shopper, will you?
We seem to have misplaced our clothes.

18:38.641 --> 18:39.676
[man] Absolutely.

18:40.776 --> 18:41.911
Chop-chop. On you go.

18:46.582 --> 18:49.018
[music playing]

18:50.585 --> 18:51.621
[sighs]

18:52.020 --> 18:53.623
Fix us a drink, darling.

18:54.222 --> 18:56.290
We're supposed to be going
on fuckin' holiday.

18:56.292 --> 18:58.562
[Harry] We've gone abroad, haven't we?
It's what you wanted.

18:58.861 --> 19:01.565
Los Angeles is not holiday.
It's a fuckin' lobotomy.

19:01.796 --> 19:06.100
And being hunted down by Joseph Stalin
is far from relaxing. Gin and tonic?

19:06.102 --> 19:08.572
Lovely. What do you think?

19:08.938 --> 19:10.507
Fuckin' whore.

19:11.274 --> 19:13.908
That's not the look
I was going for, but...

19:13.910 --> 19:16.813
No. Not you. It's Jackie. Look.

19:17.813 --> 19:18.882
[Harry] Oh.

19:19.315 --> 19:21.151
Looks like she's
having trouble at home.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.719
Perhaps we should
pay her a visit.

19:24.186 --> 19:26.156
No, no. Don't get
distracted, darling.

19:26.756 --> 19:27.958
You leave Jackie out of it.

19:32.128 --> 19:33.163
'Course.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.103
[snorting, exhales]

19:42.671 --> 19:45.040
[jazz music playing]

19:51.146 --> 19:54.550
- How many have you had?
- Four. You need to catch up.

19:54.950 --> 19:56.219
Four martinis, please.

19:58.019 --> 20:00.556
I hope seeing Sidney
isn't the extent of your plan.

20:02.691 --> 20:04.160
How the hell are we gonna
pay Irina back?

20:05.628 --> 20:06.663
Any ideas, mate?

20:07.963 --> 20:10.132
I can always get in
on some games.

20:10.932 --> 20:11.767
Are you insane?

20:12.334 --> 20:14.837
- What?
- My wife has a gambling problem.

20:15.237 --> 20:16.739
The problem is
she's no bloody good.

20:19.874 --> 20:21.874
And tell me one thing, my sweet.

20:21.876 --> 20:22.945
Hmm?

20:25.081 --> 20:26.616
Why does she hate you so much?

20:27.083 --> 20:28.852
And it's not solely
because of the cash.

20:29.751 --> 20:30.886
There's some other reason.

20:32.755 --> 20:33.957
I want to know what it is.

20:34.190 --> 20:36.293
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yes, I do.

20:37.692 --> 20:40.026
Let's say she had
a little crush on me.

20:40.028 --> 20:41.297
[drink sloshes]

20:43.032 --> 20:46.069
Do you mind? This happens
to be a private conversation.

20:51.172 --> 20:52.406
And when was this?

20:52.408 --> 20:55.145
Oh, years ago.
You didn't know me then.

20:55.644 --> 20:58.280
I was in Monte Carlo
doing some charity work.

20:59.015 --> 21:00.747
Charity work? In Monte?

21:00.749 --> 21:02.285
Do you want to hear
this story or not?

21:03.018 --> 21:04.054
Carry on.

21:04.386 --> 21:06.719
[lounge music playing]

21:06.721 --> 21:10.225
[Harry] <i>I was raising funds on behalf
of a large charitable organization.</i>

21:15.296 --> 21:18.297
<i>Irina was engaged
in a similar activity,</i>

21:18.299 --> 21:20.703
<i>and we decided
to fundraise together.</i>

21:27.977 --> 21:31.815
<i>We made a good team, and we
worked together tirelessly.</i>

21:32.314 --> 21:36.252
<i>Day and night, actually,
raising money for the orphans.</i>

21:40.122 --> 21:42.156
[exhales]

21:42.158 --> 21:45.027
[Harry] <i>We persuaded people to
make some very generous donations.</i>

21:45.428 --> 21:48.998
<i>But sadly, she was
rather difficult to work with.</i>

21:56.037 --> 22:00.876
<i>After Monte Carlo, I didn't plan
on seeing her again, and I didn't.</i>

22:05.780 --> 22:07.014
<i>Until Istanbul.</i>

22:07.016 --> 22:09.219
[tanbur music playing]

22:10.719 --> 22:12.956
<i>I had no idea she'd be there.</i>

22:14.090 --> 22:16.693
<i>I was taken
completely by surprise.</i>

22:17.459 --> 22:21.394
[man] <i>Well, you didn't
seem too upset to see her.</i>

22:21.396 --> 22:22.965
<i>Not from where I was sitting.</i>

22:23.265 --> 22:25.899
[Harry] <i>I had no clue
they were setting you up.</i>

22:25.901 --> 22:26.936
Oi!

22:28.304 --> 22:30.073
[man]
<i>I went to jail for three months.</i>

22:32.475 --> 22:33.843
<i>Harry!</i>

22:35.411 --> 22:37.910
You utter tart.

22:37.912 --> 22:40.948
She's not after you
solely for the cash.

22:40.950 --> 22:44.383
She's pursuing you
with romantic intent.

22:44.385 --> 22:46.122
I don't know. It's possible.

22:47.288 --> 22:48.892
What's the difference, anyway?

22:49.525 --> 22:52.092
- Well, I'll tell you, my sweet.
- Hmm.

22:52.094 --> 22:56.432
It's called "taking one
for the team," remember?

22:57.767 --> 23:02.072
- Well, it's your turn, now.
- Oh, no. It's not possible.

23:02.337 --> 23:05.374
- And why not?
- I couldn't guarantee your safety.

23:06.007 --> 23:08.508
She can't bear
that I married you.

23:08.510 --> 23:10.177
She wants you dead.

23:10.179 --> 23:11.314
Eh?

23:11.814 --> 23:14.281
Mmm. That's why
we've got to pay her back

23:14.283 --> 23:16.115
and stay
the fuck away from her.

23:16.117 --> 23:18.854
Forty fuckin' grand
ain't gonna get us far, is it?

23:19.188 --> 23:21.224
- It's a start.
- It's a drop in the ocean.

23:21.856 --> 23:26.061
Oh, yes. Of course.

23:26.495 --> 23:28.231
- [man] What?
- [Harry laughs]

23:28.530 --> 23:30.200
Yes. Yes, yes.

23:30.999 --> 23:34.304
- What, what?
- Time to visit that bitch you married.

23:45.815 --> 23:49.352
You do realize I still owe her for bailing
me out of that jail you landed me in.

23:50.119 --> 23:53.019
Not to mention the ten grand
I borrowed last time I saw her.

23:53.021 --> 23:54.822
She won't remember that.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.160
I mean, this time
it could be an emergency.

23:57.559 --> 24:00.863
You could need a new kidney.
How much do those go for?

24:01.197 --> 24:05.535
Maybe it's heart surgery
or a brain tumor.

24:07.068 --> 24:11.540
[man] There she is. The whore of Basildon.
Jackie fuckin' Harlow.

24:12.106 --> 24:15.508
When I married her, she was
Tiffany Wheeler from Essex.

24:15.510 --> 24:18.147
Actress/chatroom whore.

24:18.346 --> 24:20.948
You were an idiot to marry her
in the first place.

24:20.950 --> 24:22.051
I was off my tits.

24:22.985 --> 24:24.487
It was the longest
three days of my life.

24:25.587 --> 24:31.161
Eventually, she abandoned me in
some nightmare called Tenerife.

24:31.459 --> 24:33.930
Darling, I'm going to
get my nails done.

24:34.462 --> 24:37.901
- [Harry] Is that the husband?
- [man] Fuckin' weirdo film director.

24:38.366 --> 24:40.302
- [Harry] Successful?
- [man] Very.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.303
Hans?
There's dog poo everywhere,

24:44.305 --> 24:46.342
and I don't want the gardener
to have to clean it up.

24:46.875 --> 24:51.280
- Can you do it? One, two, three.
- [Harry chuckling]

24:51.646 --> 24:53.248
Oh, dear, bless.

25:10.365 --> 25:15.201
[Harry] We need to call her,
arrange a meeting. Lunch, dinner.

25:15.203 --> 25:18.941
- Get us invited to the house.
- "Us"? Don't you mean me?

25:19.307 --> 25:23.179
- She fuckin' hates you.
- What? She's never even met me.

25:23.912 --> 25:25.381
Fine, you call her.

25:26.582 --> 25:29.084
[man] Well, the last
time I called her,

25:29.384 --> 25:31.019
she threatened
to phone the police.

25:32.121 --> 25:33.653
All right, all right.

25:33.655 --> 25:35.959
Maybe it's better
if we bump into her casually.

25:37.058 --> 25:38.324
- [engine revs]
- [thump]

25:38.326 --> 25:39.362
- Fuck.
- [gasps]

25:40.962 --> 25:41.930
Fuck.

25:52.173 --> 25:55.244
White bubble. White bubble.

25:56.010 --> 25:58.946
[exhales, voice cracks]
White bubble. White...

25:58.948 --> 26:01.184
Fuck it. Fuck it.
Fuck it.

26:01.984 --> 26:06.122
Fuck it! Why don't you watch where
you're fuckin' going, you...

26:06.488 --> 26:07.623
Hi, Jacks.

26:08.657 --> 26:10.560
[laughing]

26:12.294 --> 26:15.361
Peter! Peter!

26:15.363 --> 26:17.630
Oh, my God, I've missed you.

26:17.632 --> 26:19.265
Sorry about that.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.136
Oh, don't worry about that.
That's just a scratch.

26:21.569 --> 26:23.171
My God, what are the odds?

26:23.972 --> 26:27.607
- I know, right?
- I mean it must be fate or destiny or...

26:27.609 --> 26:29.078
Yeah,
something like that. Yeah.

26:29.978 --> 26:32.047
Oh, yeah, sorry. Come by.

26:33.215 --> 26:34.584
We had a wreck.

26:40.488 --> 26:42.288
So what are you doing in LA?

26:42.290 --> 26:45.158
Oh, you know, hiding out
from gangsters and that.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.525
[chuckles]

26:46.527 --> 26:48.664
- Are you alone?
- Oh, yes, quite alone. Yeah.

26:49.198 --> 26:50.700
Where's that crook you married?

26:51.767 --> 26:54.534
[Peter] You mean Harry?
Well, we're, you know...

26:54.536 --> 26:56.104
She's left you again?

26:57.372 --> 26:58.671
Well, thank God for that. Let's
hope it's for good this time.

26:58.673 --> 27:00.475
Now listen, Peter.

27:02.210 --> 27:04.079
You should come by
the house tomorrow.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.049
You and I
really need to talk.

27:08.450 --> 27:11.219
Oh. Yes. It's new.

27:11.620 --> 27:14.123
- Do you like it?
- It's, um...

27:15.391 --> 27:16.592
It's beautiful, Tiffany.

27:17.426 --> 27:19.429
- Gabriel bought it for me.
- Oh.

27:20.295 --> 27:22.998
Atonement for his sins.

27:24.432 --> 27:26.102
He must've been very bad.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.572
Yes. He was.

27:30.338 --> 27:34.009
He was very, very bad.

27:34.642 --> 27:35.678
Oh.

27:39.113 --> 27:41.515
- It's just a ring.
- Didn't need it.

27:41.517 --> 27:44.086
- Wouldn't miss it.
- Didn't even seem to like it.

27:45.453 --> 27:46.652
How much do you think
it's worth?

27:46.654 --> 27:48.557
A small fortune,
I should imagine.

27:49.324 --> 27:51.393
Certainly enough
to pay off Irina.

27:51.759 --> 27:53.462
You deserve this, darling.

27:53.694 --> 27:55.364
- I do?
- Alimony.

27:55.697 --> 27:58.301
Compensation
for being married to her.

27:59.468 --> 28:00.633
- True.
- Yeah.

28:00.635 --> 28:01.671
- True.
- It is.

28:02.136 --> 28:03.038
Too bloody right.

28:04.172 --> 28:05.839
Hello, there. I'm Sandy.

28:05.841 --> 28:08.341
I'll be taking care of you guys
this evening. How are you doing?

28:08.343 --> 28:12.678
Well, a few seconds ago, I was fine,
but now I'm feeling rather depressed.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.247
That's awesome.
So our philosophy is this:

28:15.249 --> 28:16.716
we're a farm-to-table
restaurant,

28:16.718 --> 28:19.186
it's all small plates,
and we like to share.

28:19.188 --> 28:20.623
Well, we don't.

28:21.155 --> 28:25.494
So, two very dry vodka martinis
with a twist, please.

28:29.264 --> 28:33.136
God, I love you. You're a
bloody genius, you are.

28:34.169 --> 28:36.171
Here's to you,
my little thief.

28:39.641 --> 28:42.745
Oi, Sandy. Sandy.

28:44.313 --> 28:45.680
Where's our fuckin' martinis?

28:48.316 --> 28:50.685
[lighter opens, clicks]

28:52.888 --> 28:58.061
Now, when you're in the house,
make an excuse to leave her.

28:58.794 --> 29:00.363
Do a little reconnaissance.

29:00.761 --> 29:02.294
Figure out where
the bedrooms are.

29:02.296 --> 29:04.066
Find the exits,
that sort of thing.

29:05.667 --> 29:10.469
Right. So, get in there, get the
ring, get the fuck out of here.

29:10.471 --> 29:12.272
Pay Irina back and Bob's
your uncle, get it?

29:12.274 --> 29:14.177
- Got it.
- Good.

29:14.876 --> 29:16.645
Well, give us a kiss
for good luck.

29:21.216 --> 29:25.121
You don't need luck. I have
complete confidence in you.

29:26.854 --> 29:30.826
- Now, don't fuck it up.
- Right.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.347
Looking for Jackie.

30:13.434 --> 30:14.536
Oi!
[echoing]

30:17.338 --> 30:18.640
Jackie!

30:19.740 --> 30:21.776
Jackie. Oi!

30:25.680 --> 30:27.150
[whistles]

30:41.229 --> 30:42.265
Hey!

30:42.663 --> 30:44.764
This is my safe room!

30:44.766 --> 30:48.171
This is my safe room!

30:48.636 --> 30:49.804
Out!

30:50.505 --> 30:53.642
Out! Out, out!

30:56.978 --> 30:58.344
Fuck me, it's Gina.

30:58.346 --> 31:00.482
Surprise surprise.
Look who's back.

31:00.915 --> 31:04.719
Let me guess. Broke? No credit?
Bailiff's at the door?

31:04.952 --> 31:08.257
Abandoned by your criminal wife
in some foreign jail?

31:08.457 --> 31:09.859
Stop me when I'm getting warm.

31:10.792 --> 31:13.629
Unstable?
Medication's not working?

31:14.395 --> 31:16.932
Mine is. Now.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.867
- Where's Jackie?
- You're looking for Jackie?

31:20.869 --> 31:24.507
You're looking for Jackie? You're
following crumbs, crumpet?

31:25.306 --> 31:26.675
Where's Jackie?

31:27.508 --> 31:28.810
Where's Jackie?

31:29.745 --> 31:30.680
Jackie?

31:31.013 --> 31:32.415
Jackie!

31:32.748 --> 31:34.316
Jackie!

31:34.950 --> 31:36.451
Jackie!

31:38.319 --> 31:39.654
She's downstairs.

31:40.689 --> 31:41.724
All right.

31:45.326 --> 31:46.595
[Hans] Peter Fox?

31:47.429 --> 31:48.430
Very nice.

31:48.697 --> 31:50.496
Very nice, indeed.

31:50.498 --> 31:53.469
- Who are you?
- I'm Jackie's assistant. I'm Hans.

31:54.001 --> 31:56.736
- I will fuck you.
- I seriously fuckin' doubt it, mate.

31:56.738 --> 31:59.938
- <i>Ja, ja,</i> it could happen.
- <i>Nein</i>, <i>nein.</i> You won't, mate.

31:59.940 --> 32:02.612
- [Hans] <i>Ja, ja.</i> It will, I said.
- [Peter] <i>Nein.</i>

32:04.979 --> 32:07.346
Well, we can't have the
fireworks on the front lawn,

32:07.348 --> 32:09.582
because we can't have everyone
trudge across the grass to see them.

32:09.584 --> 32:11.351
What about their shoes?

32:11.353 --> 32:13.352
- Yeah, but we talked about...
- Well, don't contradict me.

32:13.354 --> 32:15.388
I don't think you quite
understand what's going on here.

32:15.390 --> 32:17.791
And I do slightly feel I'm gonna
have to do it all myself.

32:17.793 --> 32:18.828
Oi, oi.

32:19.995 --> 32:22.498
[hammering, distant]

32:23.565 --> 32:24.700
Peter Fox.

32:25.534 --> 32:26.535
There you are.

32:26.901 --> 32:27.937
You came.

32:29.203 --> 32:31.103
I brought you here today because
I wanted to tell you something.

32:31.105 --> 32:33.608
Can we be quiet,
please, everybody?

32:34.042 --> 32:35.878
- Shh. Thank you.
- [hammering stops]

32:38.113 --> 32:41.717
I've decided to forgive you
for everything.

32:41.982 --> 32:44.319
Oh. Right.

32:45.086 --> 32:46.953
Jolly good.

32:46.955 --> 32:49.892
Gurmukh wants me to forgive
everybody who's wronged me.

32:50.691 --> 32:51.826
So you're forgiven.

32:52.728 --> 32:53.763
This way.

32:55.564 --> 32:56.998
The fuck's a "Gurmukh"?

32:57.598 --> 32:59.131
See, I want
to hear everything.

32:59.133 --> 33:01.703
How have you been?
And what are you doing in LA?

33:02.003 --> 33:04.603
And how long are you here for?
And why haven't you called?

33:04.605 --> 33:06.438
- Om.
- Oh yes. Om.

33:06.440 --> 33:09.344
Thank you, Gurmukh. Gurmukh
could help you too, possibly.

33:09.777 --> 33:13.846
See, I'm throwing a costume ball for
Gabriel's movie, which you must come to.

33:13.848 --> 33:17.550
<i>Ja,</i> Gabriel has been nominated for an
actual award for <i>Le Noir et le Rouge.</i>

33:17.552 --> 33:18.453
Who gives a fuck?

33:20.689 --> 33:22.421
- I need a drink.
- They're right over there.

33:22.423 --> 33:24.359
Nothing for me, thanks.
I'm on a juice cleanse.

33:45.846 --> 33:47.849
- [Harry] Go on.
- Bollocks.

33:49.683 --> 33:52.887
[Gabriel] God is a communist.
I'm not a communist.

33:53.121 --> 33:58.627
Although some people
might say I am a god.

33:58.927 --> 34:01.497
[laughing]

34:04.199 --> 34:05.633
[sighs]

34:06.767 --> 34:10.036
Oh, this is that ring
that I was telling you about.

34:10.038 --> 34:12.908
This cost many millions of dollars.
I got it at an auction.

34:13.475 --> 34:17.011
- How many millions, exactly?
- 5.675.

34:17.545 --> 34:18.911
Oh.

34:18.913 --> 34:21.681
- You can see the way it...
- Darling, Peter's here.

34:21.683 --> 34:22.717
Say hello to Peter.

34:23.484 --> 34:24.518
[Gabriel] Oh.

34:30.591 --> 34:32.527
- [grunts]
- He came into the safe room.

34:33.594 --> 34:35.663
He was looking for me.

34:37.799 --> 34:39.799
How much is this guy
gonna cost me this time?

34:39.801 --> 34:42.871
Darling, Gurmukh wants us
to be nice.

34:43.504 --> 34:46.574
He wants us to forgive.
Remember?

34:52.214 --> 34:53.849
Forgive me, my muse.

34:58.252 --> 35:01.955
I know it doesn't look like we're working
right now but we are working right now,

35:01.957 --> 35:04.560
and you are needed on set.

35:04.926 --> 35:06.594
[softly]
I can't be late for set.

35:09.964 --> 35:12.200
You mean you can't
be late for Vivien.

35:14.268 --> 35:17.739
Vivien, Vivien, Vivien.

35:22.109 --> 35:24.009
[jazz music playing]

35:24.011 --> 35:27.216
And that is how you make
a bull shot.

35:28.149 --> 35:29.518
Thank you very much.

35:35.056 --> 35:36.492
Two more, please.

35:37.993 --> 35:40.629
[Peter] The problem with attending a
party is that we have to attend a party.

35:40.828 --> 35:42.765
- [chips clattering]
- Her friends are gonna be horrible.

35:43.797 --> 35:46.035
You still haven't told me how
you expect to get away with it.

35:47.801 --> 35:48.937
You could switch it.

35:50.205 --> 35:51.006
Switch it?

35:52.573 --> 35:54.676
Switch the real ring
with the fake one.

35:55.009 --> 35:56.879
[Harry] You just need
to spike her drink.

35:57.779 --> 36:00.149
Is that the best you got, is it?
Knock her out and nick it?

36:00.649 --> 36:02.917
- You think it could work?
- It has to.

36:03.884 --> 36:08.556
Without that ring,
we're fucked 400,000 times.

36:08.790 --> 36:11.026
And I promise you,
we will bleed.

36:11.792 --> 36:14.294
- [chips clattering]
- [speaking in Mandarin]

36:14.296 --> 36:17.533
[speaking in Mandarin]

36:41.890 --> 36:45.127
[traditional Chinese music
playing]

36:48.830 --> 36:50.763
[Peter] Can't get a decent
cup of tea in this country.

36:50.765 --> 36:52.998
Never mind tea.
I need a drink.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.234
- Where the fuck is that old bitch?
- [toilet flushing]

36:55.236 --> 36:57.839
- She said it was ready.
- She did, didn't she?

36:58.073 --> 36:59.074
[door opens]

37:00.908 --> 37:02.243
<i>Xièxie,</i> Wendy.

37:05.913 --> 37:07.982
Not enough. More!

37:08.248 --> 37:10.185
Oi. You're welcome.

37:10.652 --> 37:13.222
- That was a bit priggish, wasn't it?
- That's the last of our cash.

37:13.821 --> 37:16.823
- We gotta do it tonight at the party.
- Go on?

37:16.825 --> 37:19.692
What the fuck am I gonna wear?
We spike Jackie's drink.

37:19.694 --> 37:20.728
Yes.

37:21.895 --> 37:23.798
- We do the switch.
- Yes.

37:24.165 --> 37:27.266
- And an hour later, we're on a plane.
- Yes! No, wait.

37:27.268 --> 37:29.301
Jackie does not react
at all well to drugs.

37:29.303 --> 37:30.939
They do not agree
with her at all.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.076
- [Harry] I can imagine.
- No, you can't imagine.

37:34.843 --> 37:36.946
She's banned for life
from British Airways.

37:37.379 --> 37:39.248
She's not even allowed
in Canada.

37:39.647 --> 37:41.880
She is not
to be underestimated.

37:41.882 --> 37:43.151
I can handle her.

37:46.187 --> 37:47.221
Perfect.

37:48.022 --> 37:50.225
[jazz music playing]

37:56.897 --> 37:57.932
Fuck.

38:29.364 --> 38:32.234
Congratulations on your nomination.
I hear you're the frontrunner...

38:49.017 --> 38:51.317
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Fuck me.

38:51.319 --> 38:53.185
- I can't.
- Why not? I want you.

38:53.187 --> 38:55.120
Because Jackie's
right inside.

38:55.122 --> 38:56.788
Fuck that fat canary.

38:56.790 --> 38:58.727
Yeah, but there's
photographers everywhere.

38:59.027 --> 39:00.225
[shutter clicks]

39:00.227 --> 39:01.229
Hey.

39:03.031 --> 39:04.464
This is a private party, man.

39:04.466 --> 39:05.901
Yeah, but I was hired.

39:08.937 --> 39:09.971
Hans.

39:11.239 --> 39:12.441
- Take care of this.
- [Hans] Yes, sir.

39:14.975 --> 39:16.010
- Gabriel...
- Shh!

39:19.047 --> 39:24.053
I took Singapore Airlines first-class
from London. Much better than Virgin.

39:24.852 --> 39:27.922
I took Air France first,
and they had a chef.

39:29.823 --> 39:31.524
Well, I got a massage
on Virgin.

39:31.526 --> 39:34.997
It still doesn't compare
to Singapore.

39:37.031 --> 39:40.069
Those terrorists.
They ruined everything.

39:47.075 --> 39:49.841
I've never seen
so many ugly people in my life.

39:49.843 --> 39:53.011
Have any of these people ever even
seen a fashion magazine before?

39:53.013 --> 39:55.349
Mentally, I'm giving
everyone a makeover.

39:58.252 --> 40:00.221
Look at that bitch, Jackie.

40:00.922 --> 40:02.855
She's a revolting slut.

40:02.857 --> 40:06.395
[woman] Never mind a stylist,
she needs a psychiatrist.

40:09.230 --> 40:13.035
They're saying that my films
are completely self-referential.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.403
Because you are a genius.

40:16.069 --> 40:18.439
You're the finest actress
of your generation.

40:19.207 --> 40:20.873
I know.

40:20.875 --> 40:23.042
I'm so excited you guys
are making a movie together.

40:23.044 --> 40:24.877
How did the shoot
go today?

40:24.879 --> 40:26.982
It was a very
difficult scene, but...

40:28.382 --> 40:30.919
- I was magnificent.
- You were magnificent.

40:32.352 --> 40:33.387
Leave.

40:34.221 --> 40:35.990
- Chopped.
- Bitch.

40:40.093 --> 40:42.194
[Peter]
These fuckin' people.

40:42.196 --> 40:44.932
Makes me want to go on a three-day smack
binge in a brothel in Bangladesh.

40:45.466 --> 40:49.100
Darling, you're just too old-fashioned.
That's your problem.

40:49.102 --> 40:51.036
[Peter]
A fuckin' dying breed, I am.

40:51.038 --> 40:53.138
Here.
Give this to Jackie.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.406
- When?
- Now.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.144
All right. Here you are.

40:57.879 --> 40:59.381
[sniffs]

41:01.114 --> 41:02.448
Well, drink it.

41:02.450 --> 41:04.486
No, I'm not drinking,
just sniffing.

41:06.386 --> 41:10.057
Look at them. You know there are
rumors about them all over town.

41:11.125 --> 41:14.060
- Who?
- My husband and that bad actress.

41:14.062 --> 41:14.997
Look at her.

41:15.495 --> 41:18.399
[Jackie]
She's such a slag.

41:19.234 --> 41:20.335
[groans]

41:20.535 --> 41:22.237
Two can play that game.

41:27.475 --> 41:28.509
Going.

41:29.277 --> 41:31.042
[laughs]

41:31.044 --> 41:33.414
She's going to pass out
in just a second.

41:34.082 --> 41:35.480
Wouldn't count on it.

41:35.482 --> 41:39.053
I don't know,
but I am on fire tonight.

41:39.319 --> 41:41.152
You are on fire tonight.

41:41.154 --> 41:44.859
- I'm like a tornado.
- You're like a tornado.

41:46.093 --> 41:50.031
- I am like the Fourth of July.
- You're like the Fourth of July.

41:50.665 --> 41:54.236
- I'm so sexy tonight.
- You are so sexy tonight.

41:56.370 --> 41:58.904
And I have such
beautiful hair tonight.

41:58.906 --> 42:01.343
You have such
beautiful hair tonight.

42:03.243 --> 42:05.446
- Come with me.
- I'll come with you.

42:07.547 --> 42:08.549
[moans]

42:10.350 --> 42:12.486
[moaning]

42:14.489 --> 42:16.225
[sighs]

42:17.625 --> 42:18.527
[shudders]

42:21.328 --> 42:24.029
- You're so sexy to me right now.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

42:24.031 --> 42:26.332
Why are married men
so attractive to me?

42:26.334 --> 42:29.270
- We're fuckin' not.
- Make love to me.

42:29.469 --> 42:31.670
- Fuck off.
- Please?

42:31.672 --> 42:33.341
- [straining] Fuck...
- [gasps]

42:37.277 --> 42:38.513
Where is everybody?

42:41.049 --> 42:42.515
We've had this date
from the beginning.

42:42.517 --> 42:44.419
Just close your eyes
and pretend I'm Jackie.

42:47.221 --> 42:48.556
Fuck's sake.

42:50.257 --> 42:51.627
[humming]

42:52.359 --> 42:55.229
Am I havings a good time?

42:55.596 --> 42:57.565
She's bound to pass out soon.

42:58.665 --> 43:00.102
I wouldn't count on it.

43:07.274 --> 43:08.376
[squeals]

43:14.214 --> 43:16.218
[humming]

43:36.603 --> 43:40.241
Oh, Peter.

43:42.042 --> 43:45.478
Oh, Peter.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.580
Oh! [laughs]

43:47.582 --> 43:49.151
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [thud]

43:50.551 --> 43:55.023
[Jackie] Peter.

44:00.261 --> 44:02.663
[Jackie singing off-key]

44:06.167 --> 44:07.665
Oh! [humming off-key]

44:07.667 --> 44:09.136
I like it!

44:10.038 --> 44:11.573
[muffled singing]

44:15.777 --> 44:17.579
[grunting]

44:18.111 --> 44:19.413
Steady on, girl.

44:21.049 --> 44:22.250
Thank fuck for that.

44:23.683 --> 44:25.386
- We have to be quick.
- Aye, aye.

44:25.786 --> 44:27.522
- [spank]
- [giggles]

44:28.455 --> 44:29.490
Come on.

44:32.527 --> 44:33.562
[sighs] Oh, God.

44:35.696 --> 44:36.665
All right.

44:38.498 --> 44:39.665
[grunts]

44:39.667 --> 44:41.199
- It's stuck.
- Well, pull harder.

44:41.201 --> 44:43.104
- You do it.
- You got a knife?

44:44.439 --> 44:45.804
Whoo! [giggles]

44:45.806 --> 44:49.708
[Gabriel] No. Vivien. Vivien, no.
I can't.

44:49.710 --> 44:51.513
- Fuck me.
- No.

44:51.745 --> 44:54.715
You haven't fucked me in days.

44:56.850 --> 44:59.286
[chuckling]

45:02.189 --> 45:04.692
I made a promise
I'd stay faithful to Jackie.

45:05.393 --> 45:08.761
Fuck Jackie.
Don't be a pussy.

45:08.763 --> 45:12.267
Fuck me here. Fuck me now.

45:12.567 --> 45:15.103
- [Gabriel] This isn't the right time.
- [Vivien] Fuck me.

45:15.703 --> 45:16.738
Vivien.

45:19.707 --> 45:21.640
[sighs, humming]

45:21.642 --> 45:22.676
Jackie.

45:25.113 --> 45:25.946
[softly] Fuck me.

45:29.817 --> 45:32.421
- Fuck me. Fuck me.
- [Gabriel] No.

45:40.227 --> 45:41.662
[glass breaks]

45:46.600 --> 45:47.736
Ahh.

45:48.870 --> 45:51.705
[grunts, chuckling]

45:56.676 --> 45:59.911
Not now, Kim Kim. I've got
a Xanax in my throat.

45:59.913 --> 46:02.817
I heard something.
Downstairs.

46:03.417 --> 46:05.786
[ominous music playing]

46:15.663 --> 46:19.167
- Hello, Sidney.
- [sighs] My dear Irina.

46:19.533 --> 46:22.136
I do have a doorbell,
you know.

46:22.602 --> 46:25.172
One might almost suspect
that you didn't trust me.

46:25.605 --> 46:27.473
Why didn't you tell me
which flight you were on?

46:27.475 --> 46:29.810
I could have sent Kim Kim here
to come and collect you.

46:30.477 --> 46:31.712
Did you have a good crossing?

46:32.446 --> 46:33.482
Where is Harry?

46:34.181 --> 46:35.517
All in good time.

46:36.850 --> 46:39.253
That information
comes at a price.

46:44.325 --> 46:46.160
[item slides across table]

46:46.928 --> 46:48.263
[exhales]

46:50.431 --> 46:53.468
[chuckles]
Oh, yes. Very nice.

46:54.234 --> 46:55.569
You came prepared.

46:55.870 --> 46:57.439
I will not ask again.

47:00.207 --> 47:04.345
Well, if you mean her exact
geographical whereabouts,

47:04.779 --> 47:06.879
I haven't been able
to ascertain precisely...

47:06.881 --> 47:09.584
[laughing]

47:10.384 --> 47:13.221
- You lost her?
- It's not my fault.

47:13.721 --> 47:15.587
I set Kim Kim here
with the task of following...

47:15.589 --> 47:18.526
- Vlad, kill him.
- No, no, no.

47:18.859 --> 47:19.895
Please.

47:20.995 --> 47:22.697
Irina, my dear.

47:23.397 --> 47:26.531
Oh, still so impatient.

47:26.533 --> 47:28.569
If you'll just let me finish.

47:29.669 --> 47:33.874
I have been luring her
with the promise of a job.

47:34.408 --> 47:35.477
Hmm?

47:35.810 --> 47:36.844
So,

47:37.377 --> 47:39.780
if we can, uh,
just calm down.

47:40.448 --> 47:43.248
And perhaps get
a good night sleep.

47:43.250 --> 47:45.650
And tomorrow
we can drive all around town

47:45.652 --> 47:48.323
and discover which hotel
she's staying at.

47:49.290 --> 47:50.525
I promise you we'll find her.

47:51.993 --> 47:53.228
Okay.

47:56.330 --> 47:57.364
Good.

47:58.665 --> 47:59.868
If not...

48:00.634 --> 48:03.404
I will slit you open
like the pig you are.

48:04.404 --> 48:05.806
[chuckles]

48:06.707 --> 48:08.743
Oh, you are wonderful.

48:09.542 --> 48:10.875
[snorting]

48:10.877 --> 48:12.279
Oh, fuck.

48:14.547 --> 48:19.921
The charm of this little escapade
is rapidly wearing thin.

48:20.888 --> 48:22.290
Why don't we just leave?

48:23.591 --> 48:25.926
- And go where?
- I don't know.

48:27.460 --> 48:29.296
This is a fuckin' fiasco.

48:30.997 --> 48:32.900
What's the matter
with you, huh?

48:34.801 --> 48:37.738
You need a joint.
We need a joint.

48:38.839 --> 48:40.842
You said we're not gonna do
this sort of thing anymore.

48:42.375 --> 48:43.511
What sort of thing?

48:45.446 --> 48:46.480
This sort of thing.

48:47.881 --> 48:48.983
[sighs]

48:50.584 --> 48:53.020
- We've no choice.
- Oh, don't we?

48:54.821 --> 48:57.858
Wasn't me that lost hundreds
of thousands of pounds.

48:59.759 --> 49:01.962
It's not my ex-girlfriend
stalking us.

49:02.596 --> 49:03.632
It's not my fault.

49:03.931 --> 49:06.001
No. Never is.

49:07.033 --> 49:10.704
You reap what you sow, darling,
and you've sown fuck-all.

49:11.339 --> 49:12.373
Oh, well.

49:12.839 --> 49:15.776
Good night, and fuck off to you.

49:19.113 --> 49:20.511
[bottle clatters]

49:20.513 --> 49:21.882
[jazz music playing]

49:49.377 --> 49:50.545
[clears throat]

49:55.915 --> 49:57.451
Fuckin' hell.

49:57.752 --> 50:01.022
- How'd you get in here?
- I snuck in with the chambermaid.

50:01.589 --> 50:03.091
We need to talk.
Can you get up?

50:04.491 --> 50:05.627
Fuck's sake.

50:12.533 --> 50:13.935
- Here.
- What is it?

50:14.935 --> 50:15.969
It's breakfast.

50:18.071 --> 50:22.875
Oh, God, Peter. That's disgusting.
That is fucking disgusting.

50:22.877 --> 50:23.911
Did you see them?

50:26.013 --> 50:27.145
Who?

50:27.147 --> 50:29.181
Gabriel and Vivien.

50:29.183 --> 50:33.121
I woke up this morning and I
found this in my bed. It's hers.

50:33.520 --> 50:36.857
He's fucking her,
and he's fucking her in my bed.

50:37.892 --> 50:40.395
No, I don't think so, mate.
Nope.

50:40.895 --> 50:41.930
Okay.

50:42.663 --> 50:44.866
Peter, baby.

50:45.799 --> 50:49.103
Please come back to the house
because he's threatened by you.

50:49.602 --> 50:52.072
And, he knows that
you never got over me.

50:53.140 --> 50:57.846
And I could tell, by the way that
you looked at me last night,

50:58.546 --> 51:00.147
that you still want me.

51:01.681 --> 51:02.716
So...

51:04.218 --> 51:05.886
you can have me.

51:10.190 --> 51:11.725
No, thanks.

51:13.127 --> 51:14.225
[Jackie] Listen, fuck it, Peter. I
need you to come back to the house.

51:14.227 --> 51:16.964
I need you to come and stay, okay?
I really need you.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.100
Actually...

51:21.067 --> 51:22.669
- Tiffany.
- Tiffany.

51:24.038 --> 51:26.775
I can think of no one else I would
rather be in the company of...

51:27.540 --> 51:30.141
- Okay.
- ...right now.

51:30.143 --> 51:32.446
- [Jackie] Okay.
- [Peter] I need laughs, you know.

51:32.812 --> 51:35.616
- With people who understand me.
- Come on.

51:35.815 --> 51:37.618
And I need to fuckin' relax!

51:42.522 --> 51:44.658
[tense music playing]

51:47.160 --> 51:49.761
So, I think we should start
at the Four Seasons

51:49.763 --> 51:52.433
and work our way down.
It shouldn't take too long.

51:52.632 --> 51:55.500
There's only a handful of
habitable hotels in this town.

51:55.502 --> 51:56.937
- [cell phone ringing]
- Oh, excuse me.

51:58.272 --> 52:02.677
Cedric, how nice to hear from you.
How are you? Have you healed up?

52:03.611 --> 52:04.846
Good. So...

52:05.980 --> 52:07.015
Really?

52:07.948 --> 52:09.616
Oh, really?

52:09.817 --> 52:12.116
Oh, now that's very interesting.
That's very interesting, indeed.

52:12.118 --> 52:14.154
Thank you, Cedric. I owe you.

52:15.589 --> 52:18.556
Bingo.
The Chateau Marmont, Kim Kim.

52:18.558 --> 52:20.661
Shouldn't be too long
and you'll be with her.

52:24.598 --> 52:26.634
[jazz music playing]

52:30.270 --> 52:31.705
Let's get started.

52:37.911 --> 52:39.214
[doorbell rings]

52:40.047 --> 52:41.082
Just be a moment.

52:43.082 --> 52:44.618
[knocking]

52:49.122 --> 52:50.691
Good afternoon, madam.

52:52.192 --> 52:54.127
May I have a word about some of the
charges you've been placing on the room?

52:54.861 --> 52:58.499
I'm afraid we're going to need
some form of payment very soon.

52:58.866 --> 53:01.134
I'll be right down
with my card.

53:02.102 --> 53:03.071
Thank you.

53:14.013 --> 53:16.183
- Watch the exit.
- [Sidney] Naturally.

53:19.886 --> 53:21.288
[elevator dings]

53:37.937 --> 53:39.140
[knock at door]

53:40.306 --> 53:43.277
He's a stubborn little shit.
So sorry.

53:54.254 --> 53:55.589
[soft gasp]

53:59.058 --> 54:00.928
[pounding on door]

54:08.234 --> 54:11.138
Hello, sweetheart.
Buy-in is five grand.

54:11.939 --> 54:14.341
[up-tempo jazz playing]

54:20.647 --> 54:21.682
Where did she go?

54:23.216 --> 54:24.117
Who?

54:24.752 --> 54:26.219
Who do you fucking think?

54:29.223 --> 54:30.991
[clattering]

55:08.696 --> 55:12.100
Well, if all this goes to plan,
and I intend that it should,

55:13.067 --> 55:14.869
I'm going to take you
to Disneyland.

55:15.169 --> 55:18.239
Yes. I think you will have
a wonderful time.

55:30.484 --> 55:31.917
[footsteps approach]

55:31.919 --> 55:35.022
I said make it happen,
and you didn't.

55:35.388 --> 55:37.357
You didn't make it happen.

55:39.859 --> 55:42.363
I've been working
so hard for you.

55:42.863 --> 55:44.966
I'm so tired.

55:46.265 --> 55:48.368
I'm exhausted from all this.

55:48.935 --> 55:50.037
Gina.

55:50.904 --> 55:52.140
I'm not stable.

55:53.040 --> 55:54.242
I'm not stable.

55:55.942 --> 55:58.745
I wanna douse myself
in lighter fluid.

55:59.879 --> 56:03.050
Gina, now is not
the right time for this.

56:03.250 --> 56:05.049
What am I to you?

56:05.051 --> 56:09.856
You make love to her,
and then you make love to me.

56:11.390 --> 56:14.995
I have sex with you.

56:16.997 --> 56:20.065
I have sex with her.

56:20.067 --> 56:22.969
- I'm making a film. You are my assistant.
- [groans]

56:23.437 --> 56:24.839
[Gina sobs]

56:25.105 --> 56:27.141
I don't care.

56:30.444 --> 56:33.047
Make love to me. On the bar.

56:34.247 --> 56:35.716
Like we used to.

56:36.517 --> 56:37.719
[Jackie]
Gabriel.

56:40.553 --> 56:42.189
We need to talk
about last night.

56:42.522 --> 56:45.792
What was Vivien's slutty
whore-mask doing in our bed?

56:46.192 --> 56:48.292
[Gabriel] I have no idea
what you're talking about.

56:48.294 --> 56:50.395
[Jackie] You've forgotten
about this, have you?

56:50.397 --> 56:53.230
You've forgotten about the five million
dollar ring and everything you said?

56:53.232 --> 56:55.736
Well, what about if I just
throw it in the toilet?

56:56.069 --> 56:58.402
Should I just throw the ring
in the toilet? Should I?

56:58.404 --> 57:01.075
Should I just throw it away?
Fuck the ring!

57:01.808 --> 57:03.243
I don't have time for this.

57:05.379 --> 57:07.279
I am an important person.

57:07.281 --> 57:09.547
I have important decisions
I have to make every single day

57:09.549 --> 57:11.116
because I'm making a film.

57:11.118 --> 57:14.154
I'm making a film.
I am making a film.

57:14.888 --> 57:16.324
Boring.

57:17.357 --> 57:18.493
I'm gonna go to the set.

57:19.091 --> 57:20.327
[Jackie]
Not with Conchita, you're not.

57:20.593 --> 57:22.426
- Give me the dog.
- No.

57:22.428 --> 57:25.432
Give me the dog. The dog whisperer
is coming today. Let go.

57:26.466 --> 57:27.502
Let the fuck go.

57:35.542 --> 57:37.245
[gulps] Ahh.

57:37.977 --> 57:39.446
Oh, for fuck's sake.

57:43.517 --> 57:44.819
I need a drink.

57:47.087 --> 57:48.156
[glass breaks]

57:50.223 --> 57:51.992
Where's the vodka?

57:54.194 --> 57:55.163
You can't be here.

57:56.596 --> 58:00.200
- Irina's here in LA.
- Eh?

58:00.600 --> 58:02.035
[groans]

58:03.035 --> 58:04.371
[Jackie]
<i>Juanita?</i>

58:05.138 --> 58:06.937
Juanita?

58:06.939 --> 58:09.440
Oh, hi. Uh, did I miss
the dog whisperer? Is he here?

58:09.442 --> 58:10.812
- Who?
- [softly] Shit.

58:13.614 --> 58:16.080
Oh, voicemail.

58:16.082 --> 58:18.318
Gina, it's me, and the dog whisperer
didn't show up. Can you please call?

58:18.986 --> 58:21.353
Oh, there you are.
Oh, you're here.

58:21.355 --> 58:23.224
How funny.
I thought you'd be a man.

58:24.223 --> 58:26.259
No, I'm not a man.

58:26.926 --> 58:29.229
- How's your Spanish?
- All right, I suppose.

58:29.495 --> 58:32.065
Well, I hope it's good enough for
you to communicate with her.

58:32.598 --> 58:34.098
With her?

58:34.100 --> 58:37.534
[Jackie] I don't know how good her English
is. You know, we had her flown in.

58:37.536 --> 58:38.305
[whispers]
She's Mexican.

58:39.138 --> 58:40.341
Oh, I see.

58:41.107 --> 58:43.341
Which I suppose
might be part of the problem,

58:43.343 --> 58:46.547
you know, that she doesn't understand me.
How do you do it?

58:47.180 --> 58:48.950
Communicate, I mean,
with them.

58:49.348 --> 58:52.150
What it is exactly
you want me to say to her?

58:52.152 --> 58:55.053
Tell her I clean up after her morning,
noon, and night and I want some respect.

58:55.055 --> 58:57.656
I mean, she's lazy. She's disagreeable.
She's spoilt.

58:57.658 --> 59:00.060
I'm sick of her pissing and
shitting all over the place.

59:00.660 --> 59:02.896
- [doorbell rings]
- That's the door, Peter.

59:06.667 --> 59:08.935
- What?
- Dog whisperer.

59:09.669 --> 59:10.904
I've already got one, mate.

59:22.616 --> 59:25.453
<i>Hola, señora.</i>

59:25.953 --> 59:27.221
<i>¿Y ahora esta qué trae?</i>

59:28.422 --> 59:30.721
- <i>Con permiso.</i>
- <i>Ay, Dios, ella habla español.</i>

59:30.723 --> 59:33.894
<i>Su empleadora
quiere que le diga...</i>

59:34.160 --> 59:35.962
<i>¿Qué? ¿Qué?</i>

59:37.730 --> 59:39.730
- [whispering, indistinct]
- <i>¡Ay!</i>

59:39.732 --> 59:41.468
[speaking in Spanish]

59:48.241 --> 59:49.277
[Jackie]
Here she is.

59:50.710 --> 59:51.946
[gasps]

59:52.645 --> 59:55.679
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Peter.

59:55.681 --> 59:58.451
You won't believe
what Juanita just did.

59:59.685 --> 01:00:01.087
That was incredible.

01:00:02.288 --> 01:00:04.624
Thank God that the dog whisperer
was here as a witness.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:10.163
I prefer pet communicator.

01:00:10.464 --> 01:00:11.699
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:00:16.102 --> 01:00:17.268
<i>Buenos días.</i>

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.706
[whimpering]

01:00:19.138 --> 01:00:20.705
[Harry sighs]

01:00:20.707 --> 01:00:22.076
<i>¿Y tu problema?</i>

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:24.611
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:25.645 --> 01:00:26.681
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:27.413 --> 01:00:28.448
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:29.382 --> 01:00:30.417
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:32.118 --> 01:00:33.219
<i>Entiendo.</i>

01:00:34.388 --> 01:00:35.719
Well, what's she saying?

01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:38.656
I'm sorry.
She has a lot of resentments.

01:00:38.658 --> 01:00:40.792
It's hard to keep track.

01:00:40.794 --> 01:00:43.294
Well, tell her that I have a few
complaints of my own. Firstly...

01:00:43.296 --> 01:00:44.332
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:45.031 --> 01:00:46.196
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:46.198 --> 01:00:47.233
<i>Sí.</i>

01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:49.069
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

01:00:49.569 --> 01:00:51.339
She says she's disappointed.

01:00:51.805 --> 01:00:54.408
This is not
what she was led to expect.

01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:56.209
Well, that's quite
ungrateful of her.

01:00:57.511 --> 01:00:59.044
I mean, does she have any idea
how privileged she actually is,

01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:00.614
and to be adopted
by a celebrity?

01:01:01.047 --> 01:01:03.049
She said she's never
heard of you.

01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:06.019
That little bitch.

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.654
And I suppose she's never heard
of Gabriel, either.

01:01:09.656 --> 01:01:11.325
[snorting]

01:01:11.792 --> 01:01:13.661
[Harry] She doesn't think
he's very talented.

01:01:14.493 --> 01:01:16.527
Rather mediocre, in fact.

01:01:16.529 --> 01:01:19.065
- Ha!
- Peter, shut the fuck up.

01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:22.636
[Harry] She's saying you
got off on the wrong foot.

01:01:23.169 --> 01:01:25.005
She thinks you're depressed.

01:01:25.672 --> 01:01:29.440
She says she sees you
crying sometimes,

01:01:29.442 --> 01:01:32.580
and it makes her very, very sad.

01:01:34.547 --> 01:01:36.750
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:01:39.585 --> 01:01:41.756
I mean, I had no idea
that she was so insightful.

01:01:42.321 --> 01:01:44.190
She's trying
to tell me something.

01:01:45.591 --> 01:01:48.426
Something about
some new piece of jewelry.

01:01:48.428 --> 01:01:50.295
[Jackie] No, no, no.
It must be my... my ring.

01:01:50.297 --> 01:01:52.632
It's my ring. It's my ring.
Does she like it?

01:01:53.567 --> 01:01:59.707
She's saying that... that
she's jealous of the ring.

01:02:00.607 --> 01:02:05.413
She's saying that you wear it too much,
and I think she'd like to borrow it.

01:02:05.645 --> 01:02:07.114
What do you take me for?

01:02:08.314 --> 01:02:11.484
Dogs don't wear rings.
I'm not an idiot.

01:02:12.384 --> 01:02:13.687
Do you know what I think?

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.855
I think that she's having you on.
She's a little minx.

01:02:17.857 --> 01:02:19.424
[whimpering]

01:02:19.426 --> 01:02:20.728
[Jackie]
Do you promise me you'll stay?

01:02:21.227 --> 01:02:22.462
It's how I work.

01:02:23.196 --> 01:02:24.431
I move in...

01:02:25.464 --> 01:02:27.434
get to know the dog.

01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:30.337
Work with the family.

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:35.205
It's a holistic thing.
A whole lot of healing.

01:02:35.207 --> 01:02:37.677
[liquid pouring]

01:02:42.582 --> 01:02:44.214
Who the hell are you?

01:02:44.216 --> 01:02:46.152
What do you mean?
It's the dog whisperer.

01:02:46.352 --> 01:02:47.754
Pet communicator.

01:02:48.187 --> 01:02:49.754
When I called and made
the appointment,

01:02:49.756 --> 01:02:53.227
the person on the other end
of the line was a man.

01:02:53.792 --> 01:02:55.195
I had a hangover.

01:02:55.728 --> 01:02:56.763
Literally...

01:02:57.897 --> 01:02:59.232
a man.

01:02:59.933 --> 01:03:03.201
Conchita warned me about her. She
doesn't like the way she touches her.

01:03:03.203 --> 01:03:04.701
- She touches her?
- Yes.

01:03:04.703 --> 01:03:06.606
I only touch her with feeling.

01:03:07.573 --> 01:03:09.841
Chita, walkies.

01:03:09.843 --> 01:03:12.346
I don't think so, you weirdo. There's
been quite enough of that already.

01:03:13.212 --> 01:03:14.582
Chita's my twin.

01:03:16.415 --> 01:03:17.684
We have a connection.

01:03:19.685 --> 01:03:21.254
No one understands.

01:03:23.323 --> 01:03:26.727
[tapping]

01:03:35.468 --> 01:03:37.337
[cell phone ringing]
[clatter]

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.243
Oh, I better get a new glass.

01:03:44.277 --> 01:03:45.446
- Hi.
- It's Vivien.

01:03:45.779 --> 01:03:47.344
I can't really talk right now.

01:03:47.346 --> 01:03:49.350
- It's not a very good time.
- Vivien.

01:03:49.848 --> 01:03:50.884
Oh.

01:03:51.585 --> 01:03:52.786
- [Gina] Vivien.
- Right.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:03:59.593
Don't get up.

01:04:00.859 --> 01:04:03.393
[Jackie] Now, Peter,
I'm so glad you're here,

01:04:03.395 --> 01:04:05.730
and I really do want you
to stay as long as you like.

01:04:05.732 --> 01:04:07.431
Because now that bitch wife
has left you,

01:04:07.433 --> 01:04:09.636
I really feel it's my duty
to take care of you.

01:04:11.437 --> 01:04:13.439
Well, thank you, Jackie.

01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:17.475
She's always let me down.

01:04:17.477 --> 01:04:19.647
I know, and you're better off without her.
I did beg you not to marry her.

01:04:20.346 --> 01:04:21.582
[Peter]
If only I'd listened.

01:04:22.716 --> 01:04:23.817
Horrendous woman.

01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:26.583
- I hate her.
- You've never met her.

01:04:26.585 --> 01:04:28.386
I don't have to meet her
to hate her.

01:04:28.388 --> 01:04:29.422
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:04:30.422 --> 01:04:31.725
Yeah, I hate her, too.

01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:33.694
I loathe her.

01:04:34.794 --> 01:04:35.592
[Jackie] Yes, because she
fleeced you for all you had.

01:04:35.594 --> 01:04:37.864
I mean,
she treated you shamefully.

01:04:38.497 --> 01:04:40.797
You see, they met in rehab.

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:43.770
I mean, what kind of person
does one meet in rehab?

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:48.441
Huh. Maybe it wasn't her fault.
Maybe it was a court order.

01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:52.342
Yeah. I suppose I wouldn't be surprised. I
mean, we know nothing about her, do we?

01:04:52.344 --> 01:04:54.314
We don't know about her
family, or anything. She's...

01:04:55.015 --> 01:04:56.482
She's probably trash.

01:04:57.716 --> 01:04:59.850
And, you know, don't forget
that time she abandoned you.

01:04:59.852 --> 01:05:03.487
For all those months on end, and
left you to fend for yourself.

01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:06.857
I mean, God knows what she got up to.
She's such a slag.

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:10.328
I mean, when I think of all the
things that she did to you...

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:13.063
[exhales] Everybody
makes mistakes, don't they?

01:05:13.065 --> 01:05:14.899
No, don't defend her.

01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:16.900
He went to jail because of her.
I had to bail him out.

01:05:16.902 --> 01:05:18.671
[Gabriel]
<i>I had to bail him out!</i>

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:25.346
Vivien, I can't talk right now.

01:05:26.078 --> 01:05:27.978
- [Vivien] <i>Are you with her?</i>
- No.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.984
- <i>Are you fucking her?</i>
- No.

01:05:31.384 --> 01:05:33.020
You stupid bastard.

01:05:33.852 --> 01:05:37.020
You said you loved me.
Now love me.

01:05:37.022 --> 01:05:38.422
[Gabriel sighs]

01:05:38.424 --> 01:05:41.594
Vivien...
[chuckles] I... No.

01:05:43.395 --> 01:05:47.998
I want you. I want you to fuck me.
[nervous laughter]

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.035
<i>No.</i>

01:05:49.535 --> 01:05:52.837
- I can't talk right now.
- <i>You coward.</i>

01:05:52.839 --> 01:05:55.073
It's the fucking awards
tomorrow.

01:05:55.075 --> 01:05:58.375
Why don't I just go on stage

01:05:58.377 --> 01:06:02.582
and I tell the whole world
that you're fucking me?

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:04.752
Tomorrow...

01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:07.819
[sighs]
after the awards,

01:06:07.821 --> 01:06:12.860
I'll talk to you,
and we'll clear everything up,

01:06:13.593 --> 01:06:16.661
about Jackie and what to do.

01:06:16.663 --> 01:06:20.765
I am going to cut your little balls,
and I'm gonna feed them to you.

01:06:20.767 --> 01:06:22.799
- <i>Pendejo.</i>
- I've gotta... I've gotta go. Bye.

01:06:22.801 --> 01:06:27.071
You're not gonna sound like a
victim anymore. Piece of shit!

01:06:27.073 --> 01:06:28.341
[phone clatters]

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:32.042
If I met her,
I'd spit in her face.

01:06:32.044 --> 01:06:33.643
- Oh, would you?
- Yeah, I would.

01:06:33.645 --> 01:06:36.783
- Really? Astonishing.
- [footsteps]

01:06:39.051 --> 01:06:40.086
Wow.

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:42.022
Wow.

01:06:43.089 --> 01:06:44.692
You look very, uh...

01:06:46.692 --> 01:06:47.627
Hmm.

01:06:47.893 --> 01:06:49.562
I'm a filmmaker.

01:06:50.897 --> 01:06:52.763
Have you acted?

01:06:52.765 --> 01:06:56.336
For God's sake, Gabriel. She's
the dog whisperer. I told you.

01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:58.835
Pet communicator.

01:06:58.837 --> 01:07:00.841
[urine trickling]

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.012
Oh. Conchita's pissing on my chair.
What do you think she wants?

01:07:05.611 --> 01:07:06.579
Oh.

01:07:06.779 --> 01:07:08.982
She said you have
a bad attitude.

01:07:09.982 --> 01:07:11.384
You talk to the dog?

01:07:12.785 --> 01:07:14.454
[whimpers]

01:07:15.654 --> 01:07:17.557
- Hi.
- [Gina] Hi.

01:07:18.924 --> 01:07:22.662
- Did you see my movie?
- I love your movie.

01:07:24.864 --> 01:07:26.033
Mediocre?

01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:29.870
Are you my enemy?

01:07:30.169 --> 01:07:34.138
No. No. I'm your lover.

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.408
I love you.

01:07:40.113 --> 01:07:43.584
- Mediocre.
- [Gina] No. No.

01:07:47.786 --> 01:07:49.555
Mediocre.

01:07:55.527 --> 01:07:57.598
Right. Well, you take her, then.

01:07:58.064 --> 01:08:00.498
I have to say, I'm not particularly
impressed by your skills.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.702
She is worse than ever.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.171
Now, where's fucking Juanita
with the food?

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:11.611
[goat bleats]

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:18.752
[speaking Spanish]

01:08:22.621 --> 01:08:23.488
[sighs]

01:08:23.988 --> 01:08:27.560
That cunt is really
starting to piss me off.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:32.032
We need to sort this
right now.

01:08:33.733 --> 01:08:35.035
Let's go speak to Sidney.

01:08:35.734 --> 01:08:38.438
[barking]

01:08:59.725 --> 01:09:00.827
[exhales]

01:09:01.693 --> 01:09:03.060
No luck, I'm afraid.

01:09:03.062 --> 01:09:04.598
[door opens]

01:09:06.165 --> 01:09:07.832
- [Sidney sits in seat]
- [door closes]

01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:10.571
She's around.

01:09:11.304 --> 01:09:14.207
[Sidney] Well, that was the
last of the five-star hotels.

01:09:14.805 --> 01:09:19.145
I really can't see her slumming it
in some squalid motel, can you?

01:09:19.578 --> 01:09:21.680
She is, if nothing else, a lady.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.952
Take me somewhere.
I want to get fucked up.

01:09:27.153 --> 01:09:29.156
[engine starts, revs]

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:38.997
[twangy guitar music playing]

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.252
Dry martini with a twist.

01:10:09.228 --> 01:10:10.697
[sniffs]

01:10:14.634 --> 01:10:16.033
[Sidney moans]

01:10:16.035 --> 01:10:19.572
Thank you, Kim Kim.
Oh, you are a good puppy.

01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:25.879
- Evening.
- Harry.

01:10:26.211 --> 01:10:28.745
Oh, my word,
how wonderful to see you.

01:10:28.747 --> 01:10:31.585
- I've been looking everywhere for you.
- Really?

01:10:32.218 --> 01:10:34.285
Tea? Tea.
You'll have some tea.

01:10:34.287 --> 01:10:36.757
Kim Kim,
fetch some tea for the lady.

01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:41.562
Oh, and Kim Kim, uh,
we aren't to be disturbed.

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:54.173
[tapping on glass]

01:10:58.277 --> 01:11:00.314
- [Harry] Sidney, darling?
- [Sidney] Hmm?

01:11:00.947 --> 01:11:03.884
Something's come up,
something quite large.

01:11:04.684 --> 01:11:07.187
I was hoping you might be
of some assistance.

01:11:07.854 --> 01:11:10.724
Intriguing. Have some.

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:15.328
Fresh from the battlefields
of Afghanistan.

01:11:16.696 --> 01:11:19.131
[lit opium crackling]

01:11:22.835 --> 01:11:25.839
[exhaling]

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:39.019
[muffled]
Oh, yeah.

01:11:56.068 --> 01:11:57.269
Let me be Mother.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.337
Oh, I...
Don't mind if I do.

01:12:00.339 --> 01:12:01.942
[chuckles]

01:12:02.308 --> 01:12:04.077
[metal clinking]

01:12:05.243 --> 01:12:06.278
Now.

01:12:06.845 --> 01:12:08.648
[Sidney chuckles] Oh.

01:12:09.448 --> 01:12:12.385
- Oh, that's plenty.
- Oh, no. Not quite.

01:12:13.452 --> 01:12:15.821
- A little more.
- [Sidney chuckling]

01:12:21.327 --> 01:12:23.230
- [lit opium crackling]
- Mmm.

01:12:24.831 --> 01:12:26.667
Now, don't be wasteful.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.137
- Oh, steady on, my dear.
- Come on.

01:12:32.071 --> 01:12:33.840
You know what I love
about you, darling?

01:12:35.474 --> 01:12:38.178
You're a girl who knows
how to have a good...

01:12:39.112 --> 01:12:40.346
[exhales]

01:12:41.346 --> 01:12:43.183
Oh...

01:12:44.817 --> 01:12:46.019
[moans]

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.723
[lighter clatters]

01:12:50.456 --> 01:12:52.359
[labored breathing]

01:13:29.162 --> 01:13:30.430
[grunts]

01:13:41.506 --> 01:13:43.910
[panting]

01:14:01.527 --> 01:14:03.130
[grunts]

01:14:05.197 --> 01:14:07.865
You stole from me,
and then you leave me?

01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:11.134
Oh. I was just on my way
to pay you back.

01:14:11.136 --> 01:14:12.272
Via Los Angeles?

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.242
I got a little sidetracked.

01:14:15.507 --> 01:14:18.545
You're good at so many things,
Harry, but not lying.

01:14:19.511 --> 01:14:21.113
It was all Peter's fault.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.918
Yes, he blew all your cash
and made me run away.

01:14:28.386 --> 01:14:30.023
But I knew you'd come for me.

01:14:31.924 --> 01:14:33.160
God, I've missed you.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.328
Where is the money, Harry?

01:14:37.563 --> 01:14:38.799
Well...

01:14:40.933 --> 01:14:42.402
I'm working on it.

01:14:43.402 --> 01:14:44.437
That's why I'm here.

01:14:45.938 --> 01:14:47.107
So you don't have it.

01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:50.076
[blade clicks]

01:14:53.211 --> 01:14:54.848
I love you, Harry.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:58.984
But now I'm going
to fuck you up.

01:15:00.318 --> 01:15:05.088
There's a ring, a beautiful
one, worth millions of pounds.

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:06.323
And I'm gonna
nick it for you.

01:15:06.325 --> 01:15:07.928
- You're lying.
- No.

01:15:09.327 --> 01:15:10.496
It's for us.

01:15:12.398 --> 01:15:13.533
Think about it.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.970
Me, you...

01:15:18.069 --> 01:15:20.239
and millions of pounds.

01:15:21.072 --> 01:15:23.042
[laughs]

01:15:24.477 --> 01:15:26.276
And what about
the idiot you married?

01:15:26.278 --> 01:15:31.248
[laughs] Oh, Peter. Oh, forget him.
Sidney can have him.

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:33.383
[laughing]

01:15:33.385 --> 01:15:35.988
You really are a cold-hearted
bitch, aren't you?

01:15:37.456 --> 01:15:38.592
Now...

01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:41.527
come on, love.

01:15:42.595 --> 01:15:44.564
Pour us a drink
and let's talk.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.167
I must have nodded off.

01:16:22.702 --> 01:16:24.905
- What happened?
- It's all worked out.

01:16:25.638 --> 01:16:27.340
I handled it expertly.

01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:30.110
In what sense?

01:16:32.044 --> 01:16:33.212
We're getting married.

01:16:34.246 --> 01:16:36.516
Gabriel is leaving Jackie.

01:16:38.216 --> 01:16:39.516
We're getting married.

01:16:39.518 --> 01:16:41.618
- What, you and Jackie?
- Me and Gabriel.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.119
Oh, I see.

01:16:43.121 --> 01:16:44.556
[Gina thuds]

01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:51.628
[plastic clattering]

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:53.466
We're gonna take
the ring tonight.

01:16:54.265 --> 01:16:55.268
Eh?

01:16:56.568 --> 01:17:00.139
- Sidney's gonna stage a break-in.
- Well, Sidney's a fucking snake.

01:17:00.438 --> 01:17:04.209
He's an expert in his field, so
I suggest you shut the fuck up.

01:17:04.743 --> 01:17:05.577
Are you insane?

01:17:06.479 --> 01:17:08.548
The next time I see you,
you'll be in jail.

01:17:09.081 --> 01:17:11.117
- You going somewhere?
- Oh, yes I am.

01:17:11.416 --> 01:17:13.185
[applause]

01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:25.197
I'm a wreck.

01:17:26.064 --> 01:17:29.102
I've never been so happy
in my life.

01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:31.638
We have worked so hard for this.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:33.472
So hard.

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:37.711
So hard. We've worked so hard.

01:17:38.778 --> 01:17:40.013
So hard.

01:17:40.345 --> 01:17:41.513
Gabriel?

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.716
Gabriel.

01:17:45.251 --> 01:17:46.286
Ow.

01:17:47.486 --> 01:17:49.488
Uh... [sighs]

01:18:17.116 --> 01:18:19.152
What did you take?

01:18:22.087 --> 01:18:23.188
I don't know.

01:18:24.122 --> 01:18:28.294
But it was very,
very, very good.

01:18:30.362 --> 01:18:35.167
Oh, well. You might have saved some
for me, then, for fuck's sake.

01:18:38.336 --> 01:18:39.705
Sidney will be here soon.

01:18:41.573 --> 01:18:43.410
[Peter laughs]

01:18:45.243 --> 01:18:46.246

01:18:47.645 --> 01:18:49.748
Cut her hand off
and stuff it up his cassock?

This won't work.

01:18:57.656 --> 01:18:58.792

We have no choice.

I'd like to dedicate this

- Thank you, Jackie.

01:20:31.282 --> 01:20:32.982
[Jackie]
I'm moving back to England.

01:20:32.984 --> 01:20:35.688
I mean, you have no idea what I
have been through with Gabriel.

01:20:35.955 --> 01:20:40.626
And to be humiliated like that,
in front of 500 million people.

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:45.230
[groans] Conchita wants you to stay.
She wants you to work things out.

01:20:45.531 --> 01:20:46.832
[Hans]
I have an announcement.

01:20:48.099 --> 01:20:50.435
There's something you should
know about this woman who...

01:20:52.737 --> 01:20:56.441
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know. He seemed upset.

01:20:56.841 --> 01:20:58.411
I don't blame him.
What was he saying?

01:20:59.245 --> 01:21:00.779
Something about Conchita.

01:21:03.514 --> 01:21:06.783
Conchita knows,
and that's why she's so upset.

01:21:06.785 --> 01:21:08.888
Gabriel has been
taking her to set.

01:21:09.388 --> 01:21:12.925
And the three of them have been doing
it in his trailer and in his bed.

01:21:14.026 --> 01:21:17.363
Right. I need to talk to her.
Come on. We're going.

01:21:18.831 --> 01:21:21.301
What happened? Where am I?

01:21:22.667 --> 01:21:23.702
Where is he?

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:28.775
He's a liar.

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:33.412
I'll kill him.

01:21:35.546 --> 01:21:37.216
You will die.

01:21:43.054 --> 01:21:45.457
[Jackie] Tell Conchita
not to spare my feelings.

[Gina]
<i>Help. Let me out.</i>

01:21:50.028 --> 01:21:51.430
<i>Let me out.</i>

Oh, my God.

01:21:53.799 --> 01:21:56.932
<i>Help. I'm cold.</i>

01:21:56.934 --> 01:21:58.403
Let me out.

01:21:59.705 --> 01:22:01.672
- <i>It's Gina.</i>
- Oh.

01:22:01.674 --> 01:22:03.609
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:22:03.809 --> 01:22:06.610
- Gina, where are you?
- <i>I'm in the freezer. Peter locked me in.</i>

01:22:06.612 --> 01:22:08.314
- Peter, is that true?
- No, no.

01:22:10.581 --> 01:22:12.251
He said he loved me.

01:22:12.684 --> 01:22:15.418
- Peter, you didn't.
- I'll kill you.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.553
Oh, Gina.
I know you're upset.

01:22:17.555 --> 01:22:19.823
It's been a long day for everyone
and we are all very, very tired

01:22:19.825 --> 01:22:21.557
and very emotional.

01:22:21.559 --> 01:22:22.961
So why don't you go and
make us some hot cocoa?

01:22:24.063 --> 01:22:26.466
Gabriel said
that he loved me.

01:22:26.698 --> 01:22:28.565
Well, a second ago
you were in love with Peter.

01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:30.002
It's all rather fickle,
I must say.

01:22:30.635 --> 01:22:32.437
I'm really starting
to see your side of this.

01:22:32.871 --> 01:22:33.906
Right?

01:22:35.541 --> 01:22:36.576
This?

01:22:41.813 --> 01:22:42.848
[Hans] Halt.

01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:47.383
What are you doing here,
<i>und</i> who are you?

01:22:47.385 --> 01:22:51.623
We're friends of Harry. We've come
to see her. Is she... Is she here?

01:22:51.924 --> 01:22:54.594
She is a criminal,
and you are intruders.

01:22:55.394 --> 01:22:56.496
I'm calling the <i>polizei.</i>

01:23:02.067 --> 01:23:03.734
Well, if you're going
to wear shorts like that,

01:23:03.736 --> 01:23:05.638
you must expect to be shot,
mustn't you?

01:23:17.014 --> 01:23:18.714
- I won.
- You're a genius.

01:23:18.716 --> 01:23:23.322
- You are the most amazing...
- I won. I won. I won.

01:23:24.523 --> 01:23:25.955
- What's she doing here?
- I won.

01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:27.857
- Honey, we need to talk.
- I won.

01:23:27.859 --> 01:23:29.993
- Oh, piss off.
- [Gabriel] I won.

01:23:29.995 --> 01:23:31.660
- <i>Pendeja.</i>
- I won.

01:23:31.662 --> 01:23:34.433
- Tell her.
- Tell her what?

01:23:35.934 --> 01:23:37.704
[Vivien]
Gabriel and I are in love.

01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.736
He's leaving you
because we're getting married.

01:23:40.738 --> 01:23:42.442
I didn't say
I was leaving her.

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:45.008
- You said you loved me.
- He loves me.

01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:46.779
He said he loved me.

01:23:49.915 --> 01:23:51.484

You bastard.

01:24:01.426 --> 01:24:04.529
Fuck you
and your fucking ring.

[clink]

01:24:21.179 --> 01:24:23.048
Yes, bastard.

01:24:23.982 --> 01:24:25.017
Where are they?

01:24:26.919 --> 01:24:28.787
- Who are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:32.791
Who is she? You're also
fucking a Russian hooker?

01:24:33.459 --> 01:24:36.129
- Give me the ring. Now.
- [Jackie] What?

01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:38.027
Give it to me or I shoot him.

01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:40.163
Yes, go ahead. Be my guest.

01:24:40.165 --> 01:24:41.901
It's not in her possession.

01:24:44.502 --> 01:24:45.604
She fucked me.

01:24:46.572 --> 01:24:47.739
Where is Harry and Peter?

01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:50.675
- Harry and Peter?
- Harry and Peter?

01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:52.745
That's...

01:24:53.946 --> 01:24:56.416
Oh, that... Oh.

01:24:57.483 --> 01:24:59.452
Harriet? That's a disaster.

01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:06.655
That bitch fucked me again.

01:25:06.657 --> 01:25:09.191
Did she?
I am happy for you.

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:11.727
- You made up.
- We have to find her.

01:25:11.729 --> 01:25:15.000
- I think it's a bit late for...
- I will slit your fucking throat myself.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.868
We have to find her.

01:25:17.236 --> 01:25:18.770
I suggest we start
in the kitchen.

01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:20.806
Lots of hiding places there.

01:25:32.684 --> 01:25:33.719
I'll light it.

01:25:36.787 --> 01:25:38.523
So, let me get this straight.

01:25:39.157 --> 01:25:41.091
Who's getting fucked over
on this one, me or Irina?

01:25:41.093 --> 01:25:44.160
Darling, I was just
trying to keep her sweet.

01:25:44.162 --> 01:25:46.599
Oh, well, great work on that one.
Well done, mate.

01:26:03.782 --> 01:26:05.985
- Where's the ring, Harry?
- Irina.

Irina.

01:26:16.795 --> 01:26:17.730
[Harry] Irina.

01:26:21.233 --> 01:26:24.237
Got the ring.
Just like I promised.

01:26:24.803 --> 01:26:28.605
You promised you, me,
and millions of pounds.

01:26:28.607 --> 01:26:31.176
Peter, darling,
I really need your help.

01:26:34.112 --> 01:26:38.885
Irina, just put
the gun down now.

01:26:39.818 --> 01:26:40.953
And I'll throw you the ring.

01:26:43.889 --> 01:26:45.123
And you let us go.

I gave her the real one.
