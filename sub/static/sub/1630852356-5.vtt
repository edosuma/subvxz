07:36.330 --> 07:37.959
Okay, we don't have much time.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.249
Boy, you're small
and wily, shake a leg!

07:40.250 --> 07:41.499
I don't know, Ma.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.709
What if this thing
starts moving again?

07:42.710 --> 07:44.039
Ah, I'm making a run for it!

07:44.040 --> 07:45.249
Cricket, wait!

07:49.330 --> 07:51.829
Holy bologna,
this could have been me!

07:51.830 --> 07:53.419
Is it so hard to imagine

07:53.420 --> 07:55.419
that your old dad might know
what he's talking about?

07:55.420 --> 07:56.420
Yeah-huh.

07:56.421 --> 07:57.579
[sighs] Cricket,

07:57.580 --> 07:58.999
one day you'll figure out

07:59.000 --> 08:00.459
I'm just trying to
look out for you.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.119
Yeah, but not,
like, today, right?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.789
Oh, give it a rest, Cricket!

08:03.790 --> 08:05.289
You don't even know
how lucky you are!

08:05.290 --> 08:08.209
If I had someone in this
stupid city looking out for me,

08:08.210 --> 08:10.790
maybe I wouldn't be leaving!

08:11.420 --> 08:12.380
Leaving?

08:12.381 --> 08:13.709
What are you
talking about, Gloria?

08:13.710 --> 08:15.419
This is my last day in Big City.

08:15.420 --> 08:17.829
I'm moving back to my hometown
to live with my parents.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.459
Wha?

08:19.460 --> 08:21.499
My building management
is on the 68th floor.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.079
I just came to return
my apartment key.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.079
Everything I own
is out in my car.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.379
You're-- You're
actually leaving?

08:28.380 --> 08:30.919
But, Gloria, I thought
you loved Big City.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.119
How could you leave all of this?

08:33.120 --> 08:35.419
[sighs] The city is fine.

08:35.420 --> 08:37.249
I'm the one that's
not good enough.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.209
Today is my
three-year anniversary

08:39.210 --> 08:40.419
of moving to Big City.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.789
Three years.

08:41.790 --> 08:43.879
And yet, I'm still at
the same crummy job,

08:43.880 --> 08:45.619
in the same crummy apartment.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.289
Moving here was supposed to
be a stepping stone to Paris.

08:48.290 --> 08:49.499
What a joke.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.249
It's time to just
throw in the towel.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.789
Well, I get it, Gloria.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.329
We had a hard time when
we first moved here, too.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.289
I mean, we're still adjusting,

08:57.290 --> 08:59.119
but it gets better every day.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.619
That's easy for you to say.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.079
You're a family.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.209
You have each other.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.579
No one's here to support me.

I'm failing, and I'm all alone.

I-I can't believe
you did that for me.

Well, we know what
it's like losing a car

10:22.710 --> 10:24.119

Yeah, you're never alone.
You have us!

I can't believe I even had
to explain that to you.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.999
Thanks.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.329
I guess I never
thought of it that way.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.919
Well, since you're leaving,

10:36.920 --> 10:38.210
you probably wanna hit the road.
