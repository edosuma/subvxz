00:05.005 --> 00:06.638

we could go together.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.256
- Yeah like, the uh,
friend date.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.724

I wanna thank you.

- No. I mean,
that's-that's the thing.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.018
He was the perfect horse,

02:33.153 --> 02:36.321
and then a couple weeks ago
I started to notice changes

02:36.323 --> 02:38.257
in his behaviour.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.859

normal,

02:40.928 --> 02:43.662
and then the next, this.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.464
I'm afraid to go near him now.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.333
- Well, if you're okay with it,
we can bring Diamond

02:48.369 --> 02:50.202
to Heartland, and Amy and I
can take a look at him,

it's possible, though?

to throw a rider?

she confirmed she will be here
tomorrow afternoon.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.252

You know, you guys didn't have
to fly in for this meeting.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.256
You could've just called.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.191
- What? We wanted to be here
in person.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.726
Kim said it was important.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.594
- Any idea what it's about?

05:00.867 --> 05:02.033
Jack: What did he want?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.736

to discuss business.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.471
And he said, the sooner,
the better.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.873
- That's all he said?
- Yeah, that's it.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.643
Well, you don't think
he's unhappy with us, do you?

05:11.778 --> 05:14.346
- Well, Fred's been selling
Heartland beef

05:14.481 --> 05:16.615
in his grocery stores
for over six months now,

05:16.617 --> 05:18.950
he hasn't had a bad thing
to say about it.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.886
- Yeah, I could guess
that's true...

05:21.922 --> 05:23.388
until now.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.826
You know what we should do?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.961
We should have him here
for a barbecue tomorrow.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.696
Whatever business
he's gotta talk about,

05:31.732 --> 05:34.298
it should be over a quality
Heartland steak.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.368
The best thing he's ever had,
just something to remind him

05:36.503 --> 05:38.236
why he's doing business
with us.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.105
- Sure, if that's what
you wanna do.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.573
- Yeah, it is.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.376
And I've got just the thing
to make this perfect.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.311
I'll-I'll be right back.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.582
- No way she's gonna drop you.
Why would she?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.583
- Because I've heard things
about Kim.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.385
If she doesn't think a jumper
is worth her time,

05:54.421 --> 05:56.521
she sits With whoever
writes the cheques

05:56.557 --> 05:57.989
and says,
"thanks, but no thanks."

05:57.991 --> 06:00.525
- Yeah well, you know what?
You don't need her.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.194
Because according to a very
not-fake-news publication,

06:03.230 --> 06:05.663
you're "Georgie Fleming-Morris,
Future Olympian."

06:05.799 --> 06:07.666
- What if the article
got it wrong?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.567
- It didn't.
You know how I know?

06:09.569 --> 06:10.736
- How?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.105
- Because I only date
future Olympians.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.140
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah,

06:15.142 --> 06:16.675
it's a very strict policy.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.543
Usually gymnasts, or beach
volleyball players.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.279
You're my first equestrian.
- Wow, I'm very lucky.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.982
- Yeah, yeah, you're-you are.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.551
Jack: What's goin' on?
I already have a barbecue.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.454
Yeah, but not like this.
This one is way better.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.489
I just talked to my buddy,
who knows everything

06:31.525 --> 06:34.226
there is about barbeques,
he says that that is the best.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.228
Not that I'm saying yours
isn't great, Jack,

06:36.363 --> 06:37.895
but it's just, you know,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.565
it's good for family things,
this is a special occasion.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.235
- Well, I agree, which is why
we should be using

06:43.370 --> 06:45.170
a charcoal barbecue.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.839
It's a little more work
but charcoal has the smoke,

06:47.875 --> 06:49.708
and tons more flavour.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.643
Mine's ready to go,
it's in the quonset.

06:51.645 --> 06:55.780
- Well that, that's got
a charcoal/smoker combo basket,

06:55.816 --> 06:59.517
so if it's flavour you want,
it's flavour you're gonna get.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.522
Plus, my buddy said that we
should actually try this--

07:03.524 --> 07:05.323
- What the heck is that?

07:05.359 --> 07:07.058
- It's called a sous vide.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.394
It's for cooking steaks
in a water bath.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.931
- I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear that.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.068
We are gonna grill Heartland
steak the right way,

07:17.204 --> 07:19.504
and have a business meeting,
that is all.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.607
- Okay, fine.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.609
I just, I guess I don't see
the harm in having

07:24.744 --> 07:27.412
all this stuff around
just in case.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.813
- Fine.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.284
You can cook the potatoes
in your fancy water bath

07:32.286 --> 07:33.751
if you want,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.887
but the steaks aren't going
anywhere near this thing.

him down enough for me

08:00.681 --> 08:02.814

08:17.564 --> 08:19.498

(Nervous nickers)

08:27.274 --> 08:28.773
- Okay.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.878
So if someone were to train
a horse to throw a rider,

08:33.947 --> 08:35.347
how do you think they'd do it?

08:35.349 --> 08:38.716
- Well, I don't know if train
is the right word.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.318
More like abuse.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.253
If someone was aggressive
to Diamond

08:42.289 --> 08:45.657
time and time again,
eventually he would lash out.

08:47.461 --> 08:48.760
(Sighs)

08:48.829 --> 08:51.562
- So do you think Diamond
was abused?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.298
- It's hard to say, but...

08:53.433 --> 08:55.300
he's definitely head shy,

08:55.302 --> 08:58.103
and he doesn't feel comfortable
around people.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.038
But there's odd
about his behaviour,

09:00.040 --> 09:03.041
but I can't quite put
my finger on it.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.777
- Well, I'm almost done here.

09:05.912 --> 09:08.680
I wanna get these to the lab
before they close.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.648
You gonna be okay
with this guy?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.383
- Yeah, I'll put him out
in the back field,

09:12.419 --> 09:14.352
and let him get settled,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.454
maybe by tomorrow
he'll be calmer.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.289
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.491
See you.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.760

my friend.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.087
- (Laughs) Yeah well,
I actually used to have

09:50.123 --> 09:51.756
a Porsche when I was
in my 20s, uh...

09:51.758 --> 09:53.758
and I figured now that
I'm single again,

09:53.893 --> 09:56.027
why not, you know?
- Yeah, no, exactly, why not?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.830
You-you want a car that says
successful, but fun.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.632
- (Laughs) Exactly.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.633
- Right well, I think is um...

10:02.669 --> 10:04.903
this is a really good fit
for you,

10:04.905 --> 10:08.773
so I'm gonna go ahead and
set up a test drive for you.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.775
Um, what is your name?

10:10.910 --> 10:13.111
- Peter. Peter Morris.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.347
- Peter...

10:17.918 --> 10:20.218
uh, hey, um Mr. Morris,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.520
hi, this is uh, this is,
this is Wyatt,

10:22.589 --> 10:23.822
Georgie's boyfriend.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.523
- Georgie's what?

10:25.592 --> 10:27.692
- Sorry, I should explain.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.661
The um, the car belongs
to a friend of mine,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.062
he's away for the weekend,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.198
so I'm just taking calls
while he's gone.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.701
Um, anyway, uh, when do you
um...

10:36.837 --> 10:38.336
wanna do that test drive?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.871
- Actually, I gotta go.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.174
(Beeps off phone)

10:44.311 --> 10:47.078
Boyfriend?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.381
(Groans)

10:53.654 --> 10:55.286
(Crickets chirp)

10:55.288 --> 10:58.156
Lou: Okay, don't eat too many
marshmallows, you'll get sick.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.158
(Laughs) Well, have fun.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.294
I love you.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.830
And Daddy loves you, too.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.099
Okay, nighty-night.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.435
Sounds like your parents
are spoiling Katie rotten.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.438
- Uh-huh, what else is new?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.573
Sure. Um...

11:15.642 --> 11:17.241
so were you aware that Wyatt

11:17.310 --> 11:20.177
is apparently Georgie's
boyfriend?

11:20.213 --> 11:23.848
- (Sighs) It's kind
of on-again, off-again.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.117
- Ah. (Scoffs)

11:26.186 --> 11:28.252
I guess I should have a talk
with him, or something.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.390
- No, Wyatt's a nice boy,
don't scare him off.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.193
- I'm a dad, Lou, that's
kinda my job, isn't it?

11:35.328 --> 11:37.195
(Laughs)

11:37.197 --> 11:38.463
Hey, speaking of boyfriends,

11:38.598 --> 11:40.064
I see you got yourself
a new necklace there,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.667
is that from someone special,
or...

11:42.669 --> 11:45.470
- Yeah, it is.
- Aha.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.738
Well, let me guess, um...

11:47.774 --> 11:49.207
Wall Street broker.
No, no, no!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.209
He's a Manhattan restaurateur.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.478
- No, it's from me.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.381
I bought myself a gift.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.617
- Well, I-I think that's great.

11:59.653 --> 12:00.952
You know, I mean,
you work hard,

12:00.954 --> 12:02.887
if you wanna buy yourself
something extravagant,

12:02.923 --> 12:05.223
uh, why should you
deny yourself, right?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.958
You deserve it, that's great.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.027
Absolutely.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.931
- Thanks. (Laughs)

12:14.134 --> 12:17.368
(Birds chirp)

12:19.072 --> 12:21.039
- Diamond?

12:23.109 --> 12:24.876
Diamond?

12:27.380 --> 12:31.983
♪♪♪

12:32.118 --> 12:34.552

in the foliage)

12:42.496 --> 12:44.862

12:44.931 --> 12:51.302

Hey, there.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.554
Okay, you're coming with me.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.623

Good!

13:11.625 --> 13:13.158
Good boy.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.840

- Uh, me? Yeah, good.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.509
- You sure? You're looking a
little green around the gills,

13:31.644 --> 13:34.045
I'm not driving too fast, am I?
- Oh no, no, no, you're good.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.780
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.549
- All right.
(Tires screech)

13:38.618 --> 13:40.785
- All the gates were shut
last night, I double checked.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.119
- Well, someone must've
let him out.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.123
- Yeah, or he jumped.
- Yeah.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.057
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.093
Do you guys know
whose horse this is?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.262
- Yeah, that's Diamond,
one of our client horses,

13:51.298 --> 13:54.032
where did you find him?
- Not too far from here.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.134
- He's so calm.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.603
We could barely get him
relaxed yesterday.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.404
- He seems pretty chill now.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.373
- Yeah, he's like
a different horse.

14:03.577 --> 14:04.843
(Sighs)

14:04.978 --> 14:06.811
- So uh...

14:07.948 --> 14:09.814
what do you think?
Interested in the car?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.952
- I don't know, you know?

14:15.154 --> 14:16.888
See, the thing about
a nice car is,

14:16.957 --> 14:19.424
you just end up worrying
about it all the time.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.293
And it becomes kinda like
your kid.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.694
If it got scratched,
or dented,

14:23.730 --> 14:26.965
or even the tiniest little
scuff mark on it,

14:26.967 --> 14:28.966
you'd be so consumed
with anger and rage

14:29.002 --> 14:30.968
that you'd have no choice
but to just hunt down

14:31.104 --> 14:33.504
whoever laid a finger on her,
and...

14:33.506 --> 14:36.641
just crush and destroy them
with your bare hands.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.513
You know what I'm saying, right?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.883
- Loud and clear.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.586
- Good.
(Car door opens)

14:49.623 --> 14:51.155
(Police radio chatter)
Good.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.964
(Making popping sounds)

15:01.134 --> 15:02.934
(Paper rustles)

15:03.069 --> 15:04.335
Thank you, officer.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.872
Again, sorry about
the speeding, I uh...

15:08.007 --> 15:10.074
- You have yourself a good day.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.110
- Thanks, you too.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.882
Not a word.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.883
- Diamond managed to get out
of our back field.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.153
Has he ever jumped
fences before?

15:22.155 --> 15:23.554
- From time to time.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.356
I-I used to show him years ago.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.159
I guess he still has a little
bit of jump left in him.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.961
Oh, he sometimes ends up
in the neighbour's yards.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.030
It's become a bit
of a bad habit.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.831
- Are there any other
bad habits

15:33.900 --> 15:35.300
that you didn't tell us about?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.168
- I'm-I'm sorry, it must've
slipped my mind.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.103
I've just, I've been really
overwhelmed with work,

15:39.238 --> 15:41.773
and everything that's been
going on with Diamond.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.641
I'm just so glad to see
him settled.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.109
More importantly though,

15:45.145 --> 15:47.578
did you find any evidence
of Tony counter-training him?

15:47.714 --> 15:51.248
- Well see, I find it
really hard to believe

15:51.250 --> 15:54.418
that anyone would train a horse
to hurt another person.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.021
Are you sure
that's what happened?

15:58.091 --> 16:00.391
- Yes, I'm sure.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.060
When I got my promotion,
Tony made it very clear

16:03.129 --> 16:05.129
he did not think I deserved
the job.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.598
A couple of weeks ago,
I saw him handling Diamond.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.767
He was really rough.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.836
That's when he started
acting up.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.071
- If you don't trust Tony,
why don't you just fire him?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.740
- Because I know Lisa.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.608
She would never let me do
something without just cause,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.576
that's why I need proof.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.112
- Okay well, I think
we should talk to Tony,

16:21.181 --> 16:23.080
get as much information
as we can.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.483
Thanks, Laura.
- Oh, h-hold on, uh...

16:26.619 --> 16:29.020
there's something
you should know. Um...

16:29.089 --> 16:30.421
before Tony started working
here,

16:30.457 --> 16:32.223
he spent some time in prison.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.458
Lisa hired him
as an act of charity,

16:34.527 --> 16:36.260
but I have never trusted him,

16:36.296 --> 16:38.963
not for a minute.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.003
(Golf cart rumbles)

16:48.441 --> 16:50.408
(Engine idles, shuts off)

16:51.978 --> 16:53.678
- Hey, it's Tony, right?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.846
I'm Ty Borden,
and this is my wife, Amy.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.114
- Hey.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.050
- Yeah, I've seen
you two around.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.519
- We're just uh, we're just
trying to figure out

17:02.555 --> 17:04.088
what's going on with Diamond.

17:04.090 --> 17:07.057
- You mean Jekyll and Hyde?
That's what I call him.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.059
One moment he's an angel,
the next he's freaking out.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.062
- So you've worked with Diamond,
then?

17:11.197 --> 17:13.397
- No. I just train
the racehorses.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.100
- Well, Laura mentioned that
she might've seen you with him.

17:16.235 --> 17:17.868
- I don't go near that horse.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.670
- Okay, well, if you can
think of anything,

17:19.672 --> 17:21.138
a reason why Diamond's
acting up,

17:21.207 --> 17:23.307
that would really help us.

17:23.343 --> 17:27.045
- I don't have a clue.
Excuse me.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.279
- Okay.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.082
<i> (Horses snort)</i>

17:31.217 --> 17:32.617
- Thanks.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.486
- Hey, Kim's here.
- Hey.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.556
- Whose car is that?
- That's mine.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.291
- Yours? As in, you bought it?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.360
It's a little gift to myself,
you know?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.062
(Both chuckle)

17:45.832 --> 17:48.499
- Dad, um, this is my trainer,
Kim Price.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.634
- Hello, Mr. Morris.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.369
- Hey, ah, call me Peter,
please.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.238
Nice to finally meet you.
- Oh, you as well.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.974
- You wanna...
- Sure, thank you.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.142
- Well, now that we're all here,

17:58.277 --> 18:00.044
I'll just get right
to the point.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.378
Georgie and I have only
been training together

18:01.414 --> 18:03.380
for a few months,
but in that short time,

18:03.416 --> 18:06.317
I have seen her grow incredibly
as a jumper.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.120
Thank you. She's focused
and disciplined,

18:09.189 --> 18:11.456
but more importantly,
she's talented.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.791
I see really exciting things
for her in her future,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.861
and that's why I wanted
to talk to you today.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.562
There's a stable in Switzerland

18:18.598 --> 18:20.864
that runs a training camp
for up and coming jumpers.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.800
They only take a few
riders every year,

18:22.935 --> 18:25.269
and I would like to put
Georgie's name forward.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.139
Lou: Wow, Switzerland.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.606
- Yeah, it's very exciting.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.175
If she were accepted,
she would be trained

18:31.310 --> 18:33.744
by the world's top equestrians,
and have the opportunity

18:33.746 --> 18:36.380
to compete on the European
circuit.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.682
- (Sighs)

18:37.817 --> 18:40.751
- Uh, how long would
she be there for?

18:40.753 --> 18:42.954
- Just over four months.
But now, keep in mind,

18:42.956 --> 18:44.888
my recommendation alone
is not gonna be enough.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.691
Georgie will have to place well
at all of her shows

18:46.826 --> 18:49.226
this season in order
to qualify.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.563
- So no pressure then, right?
(All chuckle)

18:52.599 --> 18:54.632
- The other thing to consider
is the cost.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.468
It's expensive,
so keep that in mind.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.971
- Hmm, well um...

19:01.007 --> 19:03.341
how do you feel about
all this, Georgie?

19:04.577 --> 19:08.379
- Um, I'm not sure,
it's a lot to process.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.781
- It's a big decision,
so take some time,

19:10.783 --> 19:12.450
think about it,
but I will have to know

19:12.452 --> 19:13.918
by the end of the week.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.953
I'm so sorry, I have to run.
- Okay.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.223
- If it's a yes,
just fill out the forms,

19:19.358 --> 19:21.458
and I'll get the wheels
in motion.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.127
- Okay.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.666
Ty: Tony!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.134
Amy and I are just trying
to do our job, man.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.337
- So am I.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.606
- So why are you
stonewalling us?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.742
- Because I know you're just
Laura's little lackeys.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.410
She thinks I have something

19:39.479 --> 19:41.612
to do with Diamond
going off the deep end.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.548
And now she's hired you
to prove it.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.150
- Well, why don't you help us
figure out

19:46.285 --> 19:47.618
what's really going on, then.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.421
- I'm telling you the truth.
I don't know.

19:50.556 --> 19:53.290
But who's gonna believe me?

19:53.326 --> 19:55.292
- Maybe I would.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.361
What Laura's accusing you
of isn't fair.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.297
So instead of fighting me,

19:59.432 --> 20:01.632
why don't you help me
figure this out?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.968
- How?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.836
- You work here.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.638
Tell me what you know
about Diamond.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.540
You gotta see things.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.044
- Okay.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.180
He goes on and off his feed.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.982
He's lost a bit of weight.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.651
A few weeks ago,
he seemed lethargic.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.188
And then after that,
he started acting crazy.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.957
That's all I know.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.393
- Okay, thanks. That helps.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.329
(Horse whinnies)

20:32.365 --> 20:35.132
- Hey...

20:35.201 --> 20:38.002
I like working here.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.470
I wish Lisa hadn't left
Laura in charge,

20:39.539 --> 20:43.507
But... I still like training
the racehorses.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.813
Anything you can do
to help me keep my job...

20:48.948 --> 20:51.449
I'd really appreciate it.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.456
(Birds chirp)

21:00.426 --> 21:02.927
(Rasping)

21:05.365 --> 21:08.099
(Water bubbles)

21:08.234 --> 21:09.966
- Well, Fred should be here
pretty soon,

21:10.003 --> 21:12.503
so you might as well
get started on the potatoes.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.905
- Mhmm.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.675
- What the...

21:17.744 --> 21:19.543
(Water drips)

21:19.545 --> 21:21.479
- Oh Jack, uh, uh, don't!
Put that back in.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.180
The app says that they're not
supposed to be out...

21:23.249 --> 21:25.049
- The app?!

21:25.051 --> 21:28.052
Are you kidding me?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.788
I thought we agreed we were
gonna grill the steaks.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.723
- Yeah well, we did, but I,

21:32.858 --> 21:35.726
I figure in the spirit
of partnership,

21:35.728 --> 21:38.128
you can cook the steak
how you want,

21:38.164 --> 21:39.730
I'll cook it how I want.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.800
- You're not gonna let
this go, are you?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.935
- No. No, I'm not.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.871
Besides, the more options
Fred has on his plate,

21:47.006 --> 21:49.073
the more it highlights
our product.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.941
It doesn't matter
what steak he likes best.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.511
We'll both be winners.
Come on, what do you say?

21:54.514 --> 21:56.847
- You're on.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.553
(Lid clanks, rasping)

22:02.555 --> 22:04.755
- So if Diamond is going
on and off his feed,

22:04.791 --> 22:06.290
and he has depression,

22:06.292 --> 22:08.426
that could be signs
of mental trauma?

22:08.561 --> 22:11.295
- Or a medical condition.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.763
- Well, what did
the bloodwork say?

22:12.898 --> 22:15.099
- Diamond has a slightly
elevated

22:15.234 --> 22:17.034
white blood cell count.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.570
And his AST levels are a bit
higher than normal.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.505
- Okay, so what would
that mean?

22:21.640 --> 22:23.107
- It could be anything,

22:23.109 --> 22:24.775
I have to run some more
tests first.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.244
I'm gonna head back
to Fairfield after lunch.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.579
- Well, I'd like to come
with you.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.115
- Okay.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.383
- Cooler's full, Fred,
help yourself to a drink.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.718
- Thanks, Jack.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.520
- Things are just about
ready to go here.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.256
You sit back, enjoy a beer,

22:39.292 --> 22:40.958
Mitch and I will be
right with you.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.029
(Sizzling, cooker beeps)
- Oh.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.363
(Timer beeps)

22:46.498 --> 22:48.332
- Yeah, you know, I can tell
when a steak is ready

22:48.334 --> 22:50.200
just by the feel of it.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.237
- Yeah well, this is just
a little more accurate, so...

22:56.209 --> 22:58.742
- Is it supposed to look
like that?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.410
- I don't know.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.946
- Well, nothing like a boiled
hunk of grey meant.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.348
- It's fine,
it's better than fine,

23:05.385 --> 23:08.419
it's gonna be amazing once
I get it on the barbeque,

23:08.488 --> 23:10.588
and sear it.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.022
(Wet plop) Ah!

23:13.692 --> 23:15.359
Okay...

23:15.361 --> 23:17.027
- Yeah, it's a shame
to hide the flavour

23:17.029 --> 23:19.897
of a nice cut of steak
with BBQ sauce.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.167
You know for me, a little salt
and pepper goes a long way.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.035
- Everybody likes BBQ sauce.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.371
- Hey Fred, you like your steak
with or without BBQ sauce?

23:27.373 --> 23:29.773
- Fred, before you answer that,
just let me tell you,

23:29.809 --> 23:32.342
this is homemade,
family recipe BBQ sauce.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.877
- You know, sometimes
a good cut of steak

23:33.913 --> 23:36.780
tastes better just on its own,
right, Fred?

23:36.816 --> 23:39.216
- I'm good either way,
I'm not picky.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.252
- (Laughs)

23:41.387 --> 23:43.153
(Sizzling)

23:43.222 --> 23:45.322

23:45.358 --> 23:47.191
- Hi!

23:47.260 --> 23:48.959
Ty: What's going on, Laura?

23:48.961 --> 23:50.527
- Diamond jumped the fence
again.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.596
I-I told my staff not to leave
him unattended, but...

23:52.731 --> 23:55.299
- It's okay,
we'll help you find him.

23:55.368 --> 23:57.201
- Diamond?

23:58.504 --> 23:59.870
- Hey.
- Anything?

23:59.872 --> 24:02.272
- No. Oh, Ty!
(Squealing whinny)

24:02.308 --> 24:05.275
- Tony! What are you doing?

24:05.311 --> 24:08.078
Tony!
- Hey, let him go!

24:08.080 --> 24:10.247
- Hey!
(Agitated whinnies)

24:10.283 --> 24:12.883
- He's just worked up!

24:12.919 --> 24:16.587
Come on! Stay back,
he's dangerous!

24:16.722 --> 24:19.023
- (Gasps)
- Calm down boy, calm down!

24:19.158 --> 24:20.958
Hey... hey.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.593
(Loud whinny)
Oh! Ah! Ah!

24:22.728 --> 24:24.862
Amy: Diamond!

24:24.931 --> 24:27.364
Whoa...

24:27.400 --> 24:30.334
Hey, you're okay.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.103
- You see?
That is what he does.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.905
It's no wonder Diamond
threw me.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.673
- He was acting like that
when I found him,

24:36.742 --> 24:38.575
I was just trying to get him
under control.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.010
- You are a liar, and I am not

24:40.012 --> 24:41.779
gonna let you get away
with this!

24:41.781 --> 24:43.847

24:43.916 --> 24:45.749
♪♪♪

24:50.223 --> 24:52.056
- Here you go, Fred,
I think you're gonna find

24:52.191 --> 24:55.058
that the BBQ sauce gives this
a whole new level of flavour.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.395
- And I think you'll find
this one speaks for itself.

24:58.464 --> 25:01.165
- Wow, this is a lot of meat.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.900
- Well, dig in.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.936
- Well, good thing I brought
my appetite.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.938
(Fork clinks)

25:10.609 --> 25:11.808
Mmm, mhmm!

25:11.844 --> 25:13.477
- Mhmm, mhmm.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.918
- Mmm! Just delicious.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.588
- See? That's good.
- Oh.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.894
- These are both so delicious.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.295
- But...

25:32.498 --> 25:35.966
hypothetically, if you had
to pick the best one,

25:36.035 --> 25:37.634
what steak would you pick?

25:37.703 --> 25:40.103
- Oh, it's a tough call, um...

25:40.139 --> 25:41.805
but I think I'd have to give
it to you, Mitch.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.642
It's just so juicy and tender.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.977
But honestly,
they're both so good.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.045
I'm just proud to carry
such high quality product

25:49.081 --> 25:50.714
in my stores.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.883
I'd like to make a toast.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.619
To a great partnership.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.221
And to say my customers
are loving Heartland beef

25:58.291 --> 25:59.523
is an understatement,

25:59.658 --> 26:02.793
which is actually the reason
I came here today.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.929
Garland foods would like
to increase our order.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.798
- By how much?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.100
- Double. And as soon
as possible.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.303
- Sorry, uh, double?

26:13.339 --> 26:16.940
- Like I said, my customers,
they can't get enough.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.809
- Well, cheers to that.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.078
Right, Jack?
- Yeah, of course.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.780
- Cheers.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.451
Now, let's eat this steak!

26:27.453 --> 26:29.887
- These jumping world snobs
are bad enough here in Hudson.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.955
Imagine what they're like
on this European circuit.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.891
- Georgie knows how to deal
with stuck-up jumpers.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.092
- No, I know, I'm just saying,
it doesn't change the fact

26:36.128 --> 26:37.628
that this is a pretty
exclusive club,

26:37.763 --> 26:39.062
I mean, I know we're not
exactly poor,

26:39.131 --> 26:40.664
we're not millionaires, either.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.032
This might be out
of our reach, Lou.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.834
- Peter we have to at least
explore it.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.569
I mean, this could be
a big deal for Georgie.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.405
You wanna play
with your blocks?

26:48.474 --> 26:50.474
- I agree, but I think we need
to be realistic about it.

26:50.476 --> 26:51.808
Right?

26:51.877 --> 26:54.111
The cost of shipping Georgie
and her horse to Switzerland

26:54.246 --> 26:56.947
for four months,
it's gonna be pretty steep.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.017
- Okay, then I'll just figure
out how to send her on my own.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.819
- (Sighs) Oh,
don't be ridiculous.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.320
- Yeah, and then you can
continue living out

27:03.389 --> 27:06.389
your mid-life crisis in
that car you pulled up in.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.493
- Wow. Couldn't wait to throw
that in my face, huh?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.262
- Okay, I'm sorry,
it was a low blow.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.131
Besides, it's no Porsche,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.733
but we both have
expensive taste.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.202
Look. We can each
make decisions

27:19.238 --> 27:20.738
about how we spend
our own money.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.806
But this isn't about a car,
or a stupid necklace,

27:22.808 --> 27:26.343
this is about Georgie's future.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.978
- I don't know where
she's getting this from.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.479
I'm not trying to hurt her.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.081
The neighbor called, and said
that Diamond was roaming around

27:31.216 --> 27:33.149
in their field, I just went
over there to get him.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.952
- No, you did something to him.
We saw the way

27:35.087 --> 27:37.054
that you were treating him.
Diamond was traumatized.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.123
- Is that true?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.425
- He was being pretty rough
with the horse.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.160
- Uh, but that doesn't prove
anything, though, okay?

27:43.162 --> 27:44.761
- I-I didn't say it did.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.897
- Well, just because he was
being rough with Diamond,

27:46.899 --> 27:48.565
doesn't mean he was trying
to hurt Laura.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.234
- No, but treating a horse
roughly

27:50.369 --> 27:51.968
could cause it to act out!

27:52.004 --> 27:54.170
- But it could be
a medical condition.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.472
We still have to do some
more tests.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.107
- Okay, so bottom line,

27:57.176 --> 27:58.642
you don't think Tony had
anything to do

27:58.777 --> 28:00.344
with the horse's behaviour?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.678
- Well no, I think that
there was s--

28:01.813 --> 28:03.513
- I think it's too early
to say at this point.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.115
We're still trying to figure
out what's goin' on

28:05.151 --> 28:07.551
with Diamond, right, Amy?
- Mhmm.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.653
- Okay.

28:09.655 --> 28:12.289
It sounds to me like you've got
an out of control horse here.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.691
No real proof that he had
anything to do with it.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.927

28:16.929 --> 28:19.029
- Well, call me when you have
some real evidence.
