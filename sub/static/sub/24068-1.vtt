00:17.591 --> 00:20.391
Oh, my God.

00:20.393 --> 00:23.194
- Truly amazing.
- Look at this place.

00:23.196 --> 00:26.164
Imagine the time it must
have taken to build this.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.033
Oh, my gosh.

00:28.035 --> 00:30.670
There it is,
the podium of Emperor Qin.

00:34.975 --> 00:36.143
What is this?

00:37.210 --> 00:40.448
These must be the seven keys.

00:42.950 --> 00:46.954
Look over there...
is that text on the wall?

00:53.493 --> 00:55.796
Seven stones.

00:57.698 --> 01:00.198
Seven possible choices.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.638
Okay, well, seven stones.
Just choose one.

01:04.805 --> 01:07.139
But getting it wrong
could kill us.

01:07.141 --> 01:10.642
Okay, well, let's, uh,
let's take our time then.

01:10.644 --> 01:12.146
You got it.

01:18.585 --> 01:20.385
Oh.

01:22.822 --> 01:24.455
This has to lead
to the heart.

01:24.457 --> 01:26.527
I can feel it.
I know it.

01:29.096 --> 01:30.496
Where's Peter?

01:30.498 --> 01:32.966
Uhh, he's probably sleeping.

01:36.335 --> 01:37.701
- Peter?
- Peter?

01:37.703 --> 01:39.873
I'm here.

01:41.141 --> 01:42.806
We need water.

01:42.808 --> 01:46.112
Sure thing, Dr. Channing.
Coming right up.

02:04.263 --> 02:05.232
Where is that boy?

02:11.705 --> 02:13.975
Oh, my God! Peter!

02:25.718 --> 02:28.823
Oh, my God! Peter!
Oh, my God!

02:31.525 --> 02:34.559
- Oh, my God.
- Peter.

02:34.561 --> 02:37.362
Oh, my God.
He's gone.

02:37.364 --> 02:39.597
No.

02:39.599 --> 02:41.066
No!

02:41.068 --> 02:43.104
No!

03:21.675 --> 03:24.441
Julie, what are you doing?
Peter is dead!

03:24.443 --> 03:27.714
I'm sorry. There's nothing we
can do about that right now.

03:32.151 --> 03:33.753
Wait a minute.

03:34.788 --> 03:36.321
All right.

03:36.323 --> 03:39.657
We're here.

03:39.659 --> 03:41.258
It's here, I know it.

03:41.260 --> 03:44.328
The heart...
heart of the warrior.

03:44.330 --> 03:45.463
Heart of the...

03:45.465 --> 03:47.732
Heart of the dragon.

03:47.734 --> 03:50.371
That's it. The heart.

04:34.848 --> 04:37.318
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

04:39.386 --> 04:42.187
- I don't think that worked.
- It didn't.

04:42.189 --> 04:44.889
Come on.
I thought I knew it.

04:44.891 --> 04:46.724
- Jules, now what?
- Dragon.

04:46.726 --> 04:48.425
The dragon,
heart of the dragon.

04:48.427 --> 04:49.730
Heart of the...

04:53.132 --> 04:55.969
- Oh, my God. Jules! We have to go!
- One more minute!

07:15.641 --> 07:17.742
Okay. Careful, Ally.

07:17.744 --> 07:20.844
Not too fast, not too fast...

07:20.846 --> 07:22.916
Okay, grab it!

07:30.857 --> 07:32.156
Really?

07:32.158 --> 07:33.724
They had to do that, huh?

07:33.726 --> 07:34.994
Okay.

07:41.935 --> 07:43.937
You got this. Okay.

07:51.043 --> 07:54.347
Okay, yeah.
Think grounded thoughts.

07:59.019 --> 08:01.051
There's not a hundred-foot drop
or anything.

08:01.053 --> 08:03.522
You got this.
You got this.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.591
Whew.

08:07.226 --> 08:08.959
You're almost there.

08:08.961 --> 08:12.632
You are almost there.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.805
Come on, Ally.
Number one rule.

08:20.807 --> 08:23.509
Check for traps on the way in,
check on the way out.

09:01.847 --> 09:04.015
Well, well, well.

09:04.017 --> 09:08.286
I told you this area
was off limits.

09:08.288 --> 09:11.823
Well, you know us women.

09:11.825 --> 09:13.961
We never listen.

09:15.995 --> 09:20.131
This attitude of yours is
going to cost you this chest,

09:20.133 --> 09:22.069
and your life.

09:23.971 --> 09:26.671
- I don't think so.
- Hand it to me.

09:26.673 --> 09:28.873
This chest belongs
to Chief Al Busain

09:28.875 --> 09:29.973
and I was hired to get it.

09:29.975 --> 09:31.608
And what do you get?

09:31.610 --> 09:34.912
I'm the first archeologist
from the West

09:34.914 --> 09:36.381
to have access to these caves

09:36.383 --> 09:40.218
and its amazing architecture
and drawings.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.887
I'll send you pictures.

09:41.889 --> 09:43.353
You stupid girl.

09:43.355 --> 09:47.059
You've been taken
advantage of, my dear.

09:47.061 --> 09:49.530
Now hand it over to me. Now.

09:50.964 --> 09:54.068
Oh, man, I really didn't
want to have to do this.

11:08.509 --> 11:11.278
I believe that's mine.

11:19.552 --> 11:22.089
Alabama!

11:27.260 --> 11:28.959
And for being as old as it is,

11:28.961 --> 11:31.997
this relic's condition
is truly a phenomenon.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.464
And...

11:33.466 --> 11:36.367
even more fascinating is
the region it was uncovered in.

11:36.369 --> 11:38.670
As you can see here...

11:40.072 --> 11:43.208
And that's actually all
the time that we have today.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.112
Thank you, everyone.
See you next week.

11:49.149 --> 11:51.682
Ally!

11:51.684 --> 11:52.852
Ready for lunch?

12:01.327 --> 12:04.228
I mean, of course you don't
realize the system is rigged.

12:04.230 --> 12:05.696
It's rigged in your favor.

12:05.698 --> 12:07.864
You two are PhD candidates
while I'm still

12:07.866 --> 12:09.166
struggling for my Masters.

12:09.168 --> 12:10.501
Okay, I'll give you that.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.036
Great, now that
that's settled,

12:12.038 --> 12:14.339
how about a nice quiet lunch?

12:14.341 --> 12:15.873
Wait. I won?

12:15.875 --> 12:17.242
- What?
- No. Bennie,

12:17.244 --> 12:18.675
I would quit
while you're ahead.

12:18.677 --> 12:20.177
No, you didn't win.
You changed the subject.

12:20.179 --> 12:21.512
I didn't change...
what subject?

12:21.514 --> 12:23.147
You're the exception
to the rule.

12:23.149 --> 12:24.214
The rule still stands.

12:24.216 --> 12:25.550
Rules? What rules?

12:25.552 --> 12:27.618
Women have to work
twice as hard as men

12:27.620 --> 12:29.454
to get any kind
of recognition.

12:29.456 --> 12:31.890
That's why we were so adamant
about getting our PhDs.

12:31.892 --> 12:34.261
Nobody can argue with "Doctor".

12:37.865 --> 12:40.931
As much as I love both of
you as colleagues and friends,

12:40.933 --> 12:45.435
I would love it more if if we
could table this conversation.

12:45.437 --> 12:48.439
- Professor Channing?
- Yep, that's me.

12:48.441 --> 12:50.842
Mind if I take
a moment of your time?

12:50.844 --> 12:52.444
Sure.

12:52.446 --> 12:55.680
Do you two mind
if we take a moment?

12:55.682 --> 12:57.714
- Sure.
- Sorry.

12:57.716 --> 12:59.153
Take a seat.

13:00.854 --> 13:03.387
So what can I do for you?

13:03.389 --> 13:04.855
I'm a writer for the paper,

13:04.857 --> 13:07.658
and I wanted to ask you as
a field archeologist,

13:07.660 --> 13:09.761
with your professional opinion,

13:09.763 --> 13:12.363
how you justify stealing

13:12.365 --> 13:15.400
and appropriating artifacts
from other cultures.

13:15.402 --> 13:17.834
Oh. What's your name?

13:17.836 --> 13:19.436
Isabelle Villeneuve.

13:19.438 --> 13:22.773
That's a good question,
Isabelle.

13:22.775 --> 13:25.075
Uh...

13:25.077 --> 13:28.112
there are a few crucial
distinctions that we need

13:28.114 --> 13:32.016
to make between theft and
discovery in this field.

13:32.018 --> 13:34.618
I think that the real thing
we need to consider

13:34.620 --> 13:38.156
is that none of us
own these artifacts.

13:38.158 --> 13:41.993
I personally believe that a
country of origin should have

13:41.995 --> 13:45.897
them on display for the public,
and share, and that nobody

13:45.899 --> 13:50.370
has the right to conceal
or keep an archeological find.

13:52.038 --> 13:53.307
Where are you going?

13:56.042 --> 13:57.374
What is this?

13:57.376 --> 13:59.745
Open it.
You'll find out.

14:31.744 --> 14:34.679
<i>Alabama,
I'm keeping a daily log</i>

14:34.681 --> 14:36.748
<i>of our expedition
just for you.</i>

14:36.750 --> 14:39.850
<i>We've arrived in China
and will be heading</i>

14:39.852 --> 14:42.185
<i>for the dig site
in the morning.</i>

14:42.187 --> 14:44.290
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

15:04.043 --> 15:05.541
Tim Parker?

15:10.883 --> 15:12.083
Hello?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.950
Alabama Channing, I hope?

15:13.952 --> 15:15.118
Who is this?

15:15.120 --> 15:16.786
This is Tim Parker.

15:16.788 --> 15:18.857
I'm a huge fan of
your mother's work.

15:18.859 --> 15:21.190
How did you find
my mother's journal?

15:21.192 --> 15:24.127
You see, I know
your mother's work quite well.

15:24.129 --> 15:27.797
And I've been following you
for a long time.

15:27.799 --> 15:29.666
Why have you been
following me?

15:29.668 --> 15:31.102
And you didn't answer
my initial question.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.938
Ms. Channing, Ally,
if I may call you that,

15:33.940 --> 15:36.807
I'd be happy to answer any
and all of your questions,

15:36.809 --> 15:40.645
but I must insist that this
conversation happen in person.

15:40.647 --> 15:42.246
Um...

15:42.248 --> 15:44.214
what does that even mean?

15:44.216 --> 15:47.050
As I'm sure you're aware,
Lintong is home to

15:47.052 --> 15:50.387
the famous tomb of China's
first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.

15:50.389 --> 15:52.790
Yes, well, if you're as
big a fan of my mother's

15:52.792 --> 15:54.658
as you say you are,
you know that I am aware.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.962
Great.
Let's meet there.

15:57.964 --> 16:00.364
In Lintong?

16:00.366 --> 16:03.133
Yes.
I've arranged for a private jet

16:03.135 --> 16:04.969
to get you there by morning.

16:04.971 --> 16:08.772
Wow, you mean...
you mean, like, now.

16:08.774 --> 16:09.806
I do.

16:09.808 --> 16:12.243
And your plane leaves
in three hours.

16:12.245 --> 16:14.413
The choice is yours, Ally.

16:15.615 --> 16:17.850
Could I bring
a couple people?

16:22.488 --> 16:25.625
Driver, let's go
to the airport.

16:43.476 --> 16:46.243
I can't believe
that we're here already.

16:46.245 --> 16:48.179
Private jets must
be much faster

16:48.181 --> 16:49.213
than commercial airlines.

16:49.215 --> 16:50.613
This is so awesome.

16:50.615 --> 16:52.182
I've never been on
a private jet before.

16:52.184 --> 16:54.451
Yeah, you mentioned that like
20 times on the way here.

16:54.453 --> 16:55.685
China is incredible.

16:55.687 --> 16:56.887
Did you see how long
the wall was?

16:56.889 --> 16:58.457
It looked like it never ended.

16:59.426 --> 17:01.561
I think our ride's up here.

17:02.595 --> 17:04.295
Did you know that China
is home

17:04.297 --> 17:06.131
to roughly 302 unique soils?

17:06.133 --> 17:09.199
Oh, my God, Bennie, are you
going to do this whole time?

17:09.201 --> 17:10.901
Painow leads
the country in real soils,

17:10.903 --> 17:12.670
but Xianjing isn't far behind.

17:14.606 --> 17:17.474
Yep, that's Bennie.

17:17.477 --> 17:19.776
People here walk
so much closer together,

17:19.778 --> 17:21.311
but they never bump
into each other.

17:21.314 --> 17:23.012
Did you notice that?

17:23.015 --> 17:24.848
It's like a totally different
level of spatial awareness.

17:24.851 --> 17:27.218
And the food on
the jet was incredible.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.319
Seafood would have been
my absolute last choice,

17:29.321 --> 17:31.154
but they really
pulled it off.

17:31.156 --> 17:32.489
Guys, I'm so excited.

17:32.491 --> 17:34.391
Tell me if I'm talking
too much, okay?

17:34.393 --> 17:35.726
I might.

17:35.728 --> 17:37.361
All right, the driver
said that Mr. Parker

17:37.363 --> 17:38.661
was meeting us at
his campgrounds.

17:38.663 --> 17:40.064
Let's keep a lookout.

17:40.066 --> 17:41.567
Alabama Channing.

17:44.069 --> 17:45.669
Welcome to China.

17:45.671 --> 17:48.273
You gotta be kidding me.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.574
Nathan Carter.

17:49.576 --> 17:51.909
I know exactly who you are.

17:51.911 --> 17:54.178
Sorry, I don't believe
we've had the, uh...

17:54.180 --> 17:55.846
You're that freelance creep
who sold

17:55.848 --> 17:58.282
the Maharaja's scepter
last year in Delhi.

17:58.284 --> 17:59.717
Yeah, that was me.

17:59.719 --> 18:02.653
Mm. Yeah, scumbags like you
are the reason

18:02.655 --> 18:04.689
that I keep almost
getting arrested.

18:04.691 --> 18:06.423
All right, hold on a second.

18:06.425 --> 18:08.258
I'm here to talk to you about
Mr. Parker's proposition.

18:08.260 --> 18:11.798
Thanks, but with you
involved, I'm not interested.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.401
All right, listen, Alabama.

18:17.403 --> 18:18.768
I've got better things
to do

18:18.770 --> 18:20.403
than follow you
around all day,

18:20.405 --> 18:23.141
but Mr. Parker was pretty
adamant about speaking with you.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.846
Yeah, well, he chose
the wrong messenger.

18:28.213 --> 18:31.550
Don't you want to know how we
found your mother's journal?

18:38.490 --> 18:41.926
What does my mother's notebook
have to do with any of this?

18:41.928 --> 18:44.831
Look, I'm obviously
the wrong person to tell you.

18:46.798 --> 18:49.001
Why don't you just come
hear what he has to say?

18:51.403 --> 18:53.871
Yeah, I mean, we're here.

18:53.873 --> 18:55.806
And you might find out
something about your mom

18:55.808 --> 18:57.274
you didn't know.

18:57.276 --> 18:58.644
And there could be snacks.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.716
Fine.

19:04.682 --> 19:06.619
Good enough for me.

19:09.256 --> 19:11.654
There better be chocolate.

19:11.656 --> 19:12.957
Just a heads-up...

19:12.959 --> 19:15.295
Mr. Parker doesn't
travel light.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.965
What does that mean?

19:24.971 --> 19:27.805
Could we rent this out
for Coachella?

19:27.807 --> 19:29.776
Please, sit down.

19:32.778 --> 19:34.210
Welcome, guys.

19:34.212 --> 19:37.215
It is my sincere honor
to have you all here.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.984
And you are?

19:39.986 --> 19:42.119
Geologist Bennie Blum
at your service, Mr. Parker.

19:42.121 --> 19:44.555
Please, call me Tim.
We're all friends here.

19:44.557 --> 19:45.890
Thanks, Tim.

19:45.892 --> 19:47.725
I'm very excited
about the expedition.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.325
What expedition?

19:49.327 --> 19:50.693
I just assumed that...

19:50.695 --> 19:52.331
I'm joking.
Have a seat.

19:54.567 --> 19:57.334
So you're a geographer.

19:57.336 --> 19:59.503
I'm a geologist.

19:59.505 --> 20:00.805
Really?

20:00.807 --> 20:04.243
So, what can you tell me
about this stone?

20:08.681 --> 20:09.747
It's fake.

20:09.749 --> 20:11.681
Fake?
What do you mean, fake?

20:11.683 --> 20:16.152
Well, I mean, it's quartz,
but it's painted.

20:16.154 --> 20:18.355
I believe it's called
Australian Jade.

20:18.357 --> 20:19.625
It's common.

20:20.993 --> 20:22.226
I'm sorry, did you not know...

20:22.228 --> 20:24.327
No, I knew.
Of course I knew.

20:24.329 --> 20:26.530
I was just testing to see how
quickly you could spot a fake.

20:26.532 --> 20:27.800
And you passed.

20:30.169 --> 20:34.238
Tim, you just flew us halfway
across the country to come here.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.172
To whatever this is.

20:36.174 --> 20:38.611
Care to tell us what
this is all about?

20:39.811 --> 20:40.978
What is she doing here?

20:40.980 --> 20:42.747
Good to see you again,
Professor.

20:42.749 --> 20:44.914
Isabelle, how nice
of you to join us.

20:44.916 --> 20:47.051
No, but really,
why is she here?

20:47.053 --> 20:49.519
All questions will be
answered in due time.

20:49.521 --> 20:51.689
Look, I'm not going
to play this game with you.

20:51.691 --> 20:52.957
You know what?

20:52.959 --> 20:54.861
Why don't we all
sit down for lunch?

20:58.730 --> 21:00.634
I insist.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.706
You're not eating?

21:08.508 --> 21:10.173
Everything the body needs.

21:10.175 --> 21:13.244
Oh, you're a
nutritionist, too.

21:13.246 --> 21:15.946
How'd you get wrapped up
in all this?

21:15.948 --> 21:19.249
Mr. Parker's a
frequent employer of mine.

21:19.251 --> 21:22.286
He likes to send me
out everywhere.

21:22.288 --> 21:23.823
He also pays quite well.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.458
What's your excuse?

21:27.460 --> 21:31.461
To preserve the past
so we can learn from it.

21:31.463 --> 21:33.732
The past is a commodity.

21:35.968 --> 21:37.834
Sell it to the highest bidder,

21:37.836 --> 21:40.504
and they do with it
whatever they want.

21:40.506 --> 21:43.274
Sounds a little opportunistic,
don't you think?

21:43.276 --> 21:44.909
Oh, absolutely.

21:44.911 --> 21:46.911
And pragmatic.

21:46.913 --> 21:49.247
I don't believe in
living in the past.

21:49.249 --> 21:51.114
Well, if you improve
your social skills,

21:51.116 --> 21:53.250
you'll have something to look
forward to in the future.

21:53.252 --> 21:55.989
- The future is now.
- Mm.

21:57.523 --> 22:00.458
Isabelle, what's your deal?

22:00.460 --> 22:03.928
This expedition has
the potential

22:03.930 --> 22:05.895
to be an expedition
beyond compare.

22:05.897 --> 22:08.298
It needs to be chronicled.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.200
That's what Isabelle's
doing here.

22:10.202 --> 22:12.202
She's our official
documentarian.

22:12.204 --> 22:14.537
This pretty much
guarantees me a position

22:14.539 --> 22:15.840
at the <i>Washington Post.</i>

22:15.842 --> 22:18.976
She's a page for them.

22:18.978 --> 22:21.812
Freelance reporter,
actually.

22:21.814 --> 22:23.349
For now, at least.

22:24.584 --> 22:27.418
So, why should we trust you?

22:27.420 --> 22:30.220
I assure you that
our methodology and philosophy

22:30.222 --> 22:33.289
concerning
antiques is quite similar.

22:33.291 --> 22:37.161
Look, it's important that
I remain anonymous.

22:37.163 --> 22:39.430
I don't want the world to know
that an American billionaire

22:39.432 --> 22:41.864
is tramping through
the Chinese wilderness looking

22:41.866 --> 22:44.468
for a lost artifact,
until Isabelle here

22:44.470 --> 22:46.402
tells it on my terms.

22:46.404 --> 22:48.572
What lost artifact?

22:48.574 --> 22:52.008
Well, I'm continuing
the work of your mother,

22:52.010 --> 22:54.480
and finding
the Heart of the Dragon.

22:58.817 --> 23:02.018
It only seemed right
that we reunite you two,

23:02.020 --> 23:04.921
even if only in spirit,
by returning the notebook

23:04.923 --> 23:06.489
to you, Professor Channing.

23:06.491 --> 23:08.324
With this notebook,
we really have a shot

23:08.326 --> 23:10.059
at finding
the Heart of the Dragon

23:10.061 --> 23:12.263
and returning it back to
the people of China

23:12.265 --> 23:15.435
after Emperor Qin stole it
and buried himself with it.

23:18.570 --> 23:21.972
This was your mother's
life work, was it not?

23:21.974 --> 23:24.408
Yeah, it was.

23:24.410 --> 23:27.978
Well, then, I can't do
this without you, Ally.

23:27.980 --> 23:29.412
There's stuff in
that notebook

23:29.414 --> 23:32.152
that I don't understand,
and you might.

23:38.924 --> 23:40.923
All right.

23:40.925 --> 23:42.125
We're in.

23:42.127 --> 23:44.995
Great.
How about a toast?

23:44.997 --> 23:47.698
To the success of
our endeavors.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.132
To the past.

23:49.134 --> 23:51.203
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:12.224 --> 24:15.659
What in God's name
are you doing?

24:15.661 --> 24:19.963
I'm not positive, but
with so many unknown soils

24:19.965 --> 24:22.967
in China,
this could be unique.

24:22.969 --> 24:25.067
I just don't want to miss
the opportunity

24:25.069 --> 24:26.702
to study or document it.

24:26.704 --> 24:27.872
Wait, document it?

24:27.874 --> 24:29.239
Or name it?

24:29.241 --> 24:32.109
You're the one
to talk, Mr. Carter.

24:32.111 --> 24:33.580
Yeah, that's fair.

24:36.882 --> 24:38.449
Can I ask you something?

24:38.451 --> 24:40.049
Yeah, sure.

24:40.051 --> 24:41.852
Why do you do this?

24:41.854 --> 24:45.456
Are you really just in this
for the fame and a paycheck?

24:47.692 --> 24:50.293
- It didn't use to be that way.
- What happened?

24:50.295 --> 24:53.530
Well, let's just say history
has a funny way

24:53.532 --> 24:55.798
of biting you in the ass
if you're not careful.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.068
I thought history was only
supposed to repeat itself.

24:59.070 --> 25:01.438
Yeah, and I explore
ancient temples.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.407
So, after a few
too many run-ins

25:03.409 --> 25:05.342
with history trying
to repeat itself,

25:05.344 --> 25:08.245
I just started selling
to the highest-paying customer.

25:08.247 --> 25:10.881
I figure if I'm going to put
my life on the line,

25:10.883 --> 25:13.484
I might as well
get paid for it.

25:13.486 --> 25:18.024
Ah, so,
Ally was right, then.

25:20.326 --> 25:23.293
Yeah, looks like it, huh?

25:23.295 --> 25:26.432
How about you?
What are you in it for?

25:28.933 --> 25:30.668
Not sure, really.

25:30.670 --> 25:32.936
I've always been labeled
the smart guy,

25:32.938 --> 25:34.571
or the nerd, if you will.

25:34.573 --> 25:36.507
Yeah, I can see that.

25:36.509 --> 25:39.943
But I guess I just wanted
to do something more.

25:39.945 --> 25:41.812
An adventure seemed like
the kind of thing

25:41.814 --> 25:43.947
that would give me
a story to tell.

25:43.949 --> 25:46.519
Other than how hard I studied.

25:48.554 --> 25:52.292
Bennie Blum,
globe-trotting adventurer.

25:53.759 --> 25:56.660
Actually, that's got kind
of a nice ring to it.

25:56.662 --> 25:58.595
Yeah.

25:58.597 --> 26:01.064
I don't know.
Maybe it's dumb.

26:01.066 --> 26:03.467
Naw.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

26:03.469 --> 26:05.134
It's not like we're saving
lives here.

26:05.136 --> 26:06.705
They're relics.

26:10.241 --> 26:13.043
Well, I'm...
I'm getting tired.

26:13.045 --> 26:15.879
Seems like we have
a pretty big day

26:15.881 --> 26:17.913
ahead of ourselves
tomorrow, so...

26:17.915 --> 26:19.284
Yeah.

26:44.410 --> 26:47.478
Okay, so, what's the plan?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.080
Okay, it's gonna
be difficult

26:49.082 --> 26:50.613
because we're gonna
see some of

26:50.615 --> 26:53.017
the most incredible,
untouched artifacts

26:53.019 --> 26:54.484
of ancient Chinese culture,

26:54.486 --> 26:56.754
but we have to keep our
wits about ourselves

26:56.756 --> 26:58.654
because we need to
look out for trip wires

26:58.656 --> 27:02.258
and trap doors and probably
some really nasty surprises.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.494
I know we're here
to find the Heart,

27:04.496 --> 27:08.167
but I think that there's
something else going on.

27:10.769 --> 27:13.437
You know how Tim mentioned
something

27:13.439 --> 27:16.172
about my code
with my mother.

27:16.174 --> 27:19.375
My mother and I had this
sort of language

27:19.377 --> 27:21.678
that only the two of us
could understand, and...

27:21.680 --> 27:23.881
Wait, you remember all that
from when you were five?

27:23.883 --> 27:27.350
It's like the only thing that
I remember from my mother,

27:27.352 --> 27:29.819
but I know she was looking
for something.

27:29.821 --> 27:31.588
Like some sort of special key

27:31.590 --> 27:34.057
that she was sure existed
to protect the Heart.

27:34.059 --> 27:37.259
It's kind of all that she
talked about when I was little.

27:37.261 --> 27:39.129
A key like to a lock?

27:39.131 --> 27:41.065
She called it
the mythical key.

27:41.067 --> 27:43.600
So it might not be
an actual key.

27:43.602 --> 27:45.634
Truthfully, I think
that she found it,

27:45.636 --> 27:47.836
and I think she was
killed for it.

27:47.838 --> 27:50.673
Emperor Qin was the first
and last unifier of China.

27:50.675 --> 27:53.075
A relic from his tomb
could be worth millions,

27:53.077 --> 27:55.578
and I don't think that
we can trust Nathan or Tim

27:55.580 --> 27:58.280
to do the right thing
if we find it.

27:58.282 --> 28:01.718
I know that this is more
than you signed up for.

28:01.720 --> 28:05.154
So, I understand
if you want to leave.

28:05.156 --> 28:07.824
What?
Girl, I'm not going anywhere.

28:07.826 --> 28:10.328
I could be giving a boring
lecture right now.

28:11.763 --> 28:13.898
I don't care!

28:13.900 --> 28:15.334
What was that?

28:17.403 --> 28:20.105
I'm sorry. Come here.

28:31.049 --> 28:33.382
Tim's lying about Isabelle.

28:33.384 --> 28:35.518
He's making out
with her by his tent.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.587
- Not by his tent.
- Are you mocking me?

28:37.589 --> 28:38.956
Oh, okay, yes.

28:38.958 --> 28:42.327
Well, I just... I don't totally
understand why we care.

28:43.695 --> 28:46.729
I guess I'm just surprised.

28:46.731 --> 28:49.466
They didn't seem like
they were together earlier.

28:49.468 --> 28:52.236
Don't let it get to you.

28:52.238 --> 28:54.774
We've got plenty
to worry about as it is.

28:56.642 --> 28:58.141
Night, boo.

28:58.143 --> 29:00.145
Good night.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.229
No!

30:16.923 --> 30:18.891
Ah!

30:20.692 --> 30:22.992
Isabelle!

30:22.994 --> 30:25.530
Oh, no, no. Stay with us.

30:30.269 --> 30:31.500
Where's Tim?

30:31.502 --> 30:33.306
I don't know,
I don't know!

30:35.207 --> 30:37.740
One of you guys
got a drink?

30:37.742 --> 30:39.642
Aw, come on,
I know one of you guys does.

30:41.512 --> 30:43.813
What, no English?
Come on.

30:43.815 --> 30:46.382
Look who finally
decided to show up.

30:46.384 --> 30:48.551
Oh my God, Isabelle.

30:48.553 --> 30:51.087
I'm sorry, she's gone.

30:51.089 --> 30:53.090
They took Nathan!

30:53.092 --> 30:56.159
We have to go get him,
or they'll kill him, too.

30:56.161 --> 30:58.996
No. There's no reason
for us all to die.

30:58.998 --> 31:01.565
You can stay here,
but Nathan needs our help.

31:01.567 --> 31:04.537
Well, then I guess
I'm going with you.

31:08.173 --> 31:10.606
They weren't anticipating
us following.

31:10.608 --> 31:12.976
- That's a good thing, right?
- No.

31:12.978 --> 31:15.946
Either they don't
think someone's coming,

31:15.948 --> 31:18.985
or they're really prepared
for someone coming.

32:51.009 --> 32:52.476
- Okay.
- Ah!

32:52.478 --> 32:54.710
Come on, don't do that.

32:54.712 --> 32:58.113
So, was your little
excursion successful?

32:58.115 --> 33:00.283
Well, they know
we're following them.

33:00.285 --> 33:02.753
Wait, what do you mean?
I don't understand.

33:02.755 --> 33:04.587
They're making
really good timing,

33:04.589 --> 33:06.123
but they're also
being sloppy.

33:06.125 --> 33:08.725
And you're sure that
these are the same men

33:08.727 --> 33:10.360
who attacked us at
the campground?

33:10.362 --> 33:12.261
I'm pretty sure.

33:12.263 --> 33:14.264
And what implies
this certainty?

33:14.266 --> 33:16.467
I didn't think people
still spoke like that.

33:16.469 --> 33:18.000
Shh.

33:18.002 --> 33:20.804
Well, first of all, they
keep moving away from us.

33:20.806 --> 33:25.209
Secondly, I'm pretty certain
that this is

33:25.211 --> 33:27.747
an alcohol-soaked piece
of Nathan's shirt.

33:30.648 --> 33:33.449
It certainly smells like him.

33:33.451 --> 33:35.084
So you saw them?

33:35.086 --> 33:37.053
I saw the one that wanted
to be seen.

33:37.055 --> 33:39.421
That implies that
they're watching us.

33:39.423 --> 33:40.958
Yeah, without a doubt.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.526
Matter of fact, I'm pretty
sure they started

33:42.528 --> 33:44.026
at the campground,
if not sooner.

33:44.028 --> 33:45.260
But why?

33:45.262 --> 33:47.665
That's a great question.

33:49.501 --> 33:52.000
Care to answer, Mr. Parker?

33:52.002 --> 33:55.974
Oh, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

33:58.374 --> 33:59.575
All that talk about
anonymity wasn't just

33:59.577 --> 34:01.744
about evading the paparazzi,
was it?

34:01.746 --> 34:03.613
You really are as clever
as advertised.

34:03.615 --> 34:05.614
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- What?

34:05.616 --> 34:06.649
Did you think that
no competitors

34:06.651 --> 34:08.117
would come for this prize?

34:08.119 --> 34:09.952
A little heads up would
have been really nice.

34:09.954 --> 34:12.454
Yet completely irrelevant
to our plan of action.

34:12.456 --> 34:14.891
- He's right.
- What?

34:14.893 --> 34:16.293
Wait, you agree with him?

34:16.295 --> 34:17.893
It would have drawn attention.

34:17.896 --> 34:19.128
We really don't need
that right now.

34:19.130 --> 34:22.099
But they already
know we're here.

34:22.101 --> 34:26.101
Okay.
Well, who are these guys?

34:26.103 --> 34:28.304
I can't be sure.

34:28.306 --> 34:29.972
Would you care
to make a guess?

34:29.974 --> 34:31.974
It could be any number
of groups

34:31.976 --> 34:33.809
trying to acquire
rare antiques.

34:33.811 --> 34:35.445
Sounds like exactly
the kind of people

34:35.447 --> 34:38.213
our friend Nathan interacts
with on a daily basis.

34:38.215 --> 34:41.052
Let's catch up with him
and find out.

34:43.152 --> 34:44.889
I agree.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.556
Ahh, Lei Wei,
you've returned.

34:50.561 --> 34:52.494
Sifu.

34:52.496 --> 34:54.463
I see you've been successful.

34:54.465 --> 34:56.032
Yes, Sifu.

34:56.034 --> 34:58.302
You should have never
killed the girl.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.269
Yes, Sifu.

35:00.271 --> 35:02.405
Mr. Carter.

35:02.407 --> 35:03.807
In the flesh.

35:03.809 --> 35:05.675
Under different
circumstances this meeting

35:05.677 --> 35:08.177
may have been more cordial.

35:08.179 --> 35:09.979
I'm hurt.

35:09.981 --> 35:12.115
You didn't even take
the chance to get to know me.

35:12.117 --> 35:14.583
But your
reputation precedes you.

35:14.585 --> 35:16.985
Ha! Which is?

35:16.987 --> 35:21.858
Nefarious treasure hunter,
dealer of lost antiquities,

35:21.860 --> 35:24.927
and loyalty
to the highest bidder.

35:24.929 --> 35:28.764
Ah, extremely good-
looking should really be

35:28.766 --> 35:31.503
at the top there somewhere.

35:32.804 --> 35:37.807
The Tao says think
lightly of yourself

35:37.809 --> 35:39.909
and more deeply of the world.

35:39.911 --> 35:42.043
Mm, and, uh,
if I'm not mistaken

35:42.045 --> 35:43.981
it should also say
something about

35:43.983 --> 35:45.918
do not regret
what you've done?

35:54.592 --> 35:56.228
Someone's smitten.

36:04.501 --> 36:06.237
What was the girl's name?

36:11.742 --> 36:14.344
You will tell me her name.

36:14.346 --> 36:17.583
Alabama Channing.

36:18.483 --> 36:20.152
They call her Ally.

36:38.936 --> 36:41.239
I must give this more thought.

36:50.181 --> 36:52.884
Well, aren't you
a cheery bunch?

37:04.362 --> 37:06.162
Can we move any faster?

37:06.164 --> 37:09.134
If you can track faster
than me, by all means.

37:10.367 --> 37:11.800
Never mind.

37:11.802 --> 37:13.436
Come on, guys.
We've really gotta press on.

37:13.438 --> 37:17.340
Actually, Bennie, come on.
You can do better than that.

37:17.342 --> 37:18.811
Okay.

37:23.248 --> 37:24.383
Stop.

37:32.090 --> 37:33.125
Oh.

37:40.998 --> 37:43.833
Maybe you should stay at point.

37:43.835 --> 37:45.703
If you say so.

38:46.364 --> 38:49.030
Not exactly what
we signed up for, huh?

38:49.032 --> 38:50.999
No recovery ever is.

38:51.001 --> 38:53.101
You know
what's strange, though?

38:53.103 --> 38:54.704
The creepy rich guy?

38:54.706 --> 38:56.972
Other than the high acidity
level in the soil samples?

38:56.974 --> 38:59.141
- 2,000 year old treasure?
- Nathan being kidnapped?

38:59.143 --> 39:00.510
The booby traps?
I give up.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.010
I don't think that
any of these traps

39:02.012 --> 39:04.146
are intended to be lethal.

39:04.148 --> 39:07.018
Maybe what happened
to Isabelle was an accident.

39:09.288 --> 39:12.021
Look, these traps could
have been much worse.

39:12.023 --> 39:14.226
Yeah, I actually
agree with you.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.679
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

39:37.681 --> 39:42.221
I gotta follow the guys,
or the trail is gonna go cold.

39:43.420 --> 39:45.389
- Meet back here.
- Meet back here.

40:29.701 --> 40:31.900
Hey, buddy.

40:31.902 --> 40:33.637
You okay? Wake up.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.271
Ohh. My head.

40:35.273 --> 40:36.673
Good,
you're still alive.

40:36.675 --> 40:38.773
Now get up.
We've gotta go meet Ally.

40:38.775 --> 40:40.075
Wait, where is she?

40:40.077 --> 40:41.610
She went after
our new super fans.

40:41.612 --> 40:42.811
By herself?

40:42.813 --> 40:44.246
Which is why
we have to hurry.

40:44.248 --> 40:46.349
Ugh, blame it
on the head trauma.

40:46.351 --> 40:48.418
Ah, are you grouchy
after your nappy?

40:48.420 --> 40:50.019
Be nice to me.

40:50.021 --> 40:51.954
Ow, ow, be careful,
be careful.

40:51.956 --> 40:55.224
- Oh, my God.
- I need my samples.

40:55.226 --> 40:56.760
It's a bag of dirt,
man, come on.

40:56.762 --> 40:58.295
Are you guys always like this?

40:58.297 --> 41:00.499
- Pretty much.
- Yes.

41:21.052 --> 41:22.450
Oh, bravo.

41:22.452 --> 41:24.487
You played right
into their hands.

41:24.489 --> 41:26.021
You're welcome.

41:26.023 --> 41:28.557
I'm sorry,
for what, exactly?

41:28.559 --> 41:30.226
Rescuing you.

41:30.228 --> 41:32.961
Yeah, this doesn't look
exactly like a rescue.

41:32.963 --> 41:34.363
You know, for someone
so cocky,

41:34.365 --> 41:36.331
- you really have little faith.
- Mm.

41:36.333 --> 41:39.568
Please,
Professor Alabama.

41:39.570 --> 41:42.907
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

41:46.010 --> 41:48.647
I am just a person...

41:50.481 --> 41:52.284
Same as you.

41:53.150 --> 41:55.552
Not even close.

42:48.206 --> 42:51.807
Hey, thanks for the help.

42:51.809 --> 42:54.443
Well, I underestimated you.

42:54.445 --> 42:56.912
Wouldn't be the first time.

42:56.914 --> 42:59.284
Hey, uh, you mind?

43:01.820 --> 43:03.385
So what's the plan?

43:03.387 --> 43:05.186
We need to rendezvous
with everyone else

43:05.188 --> 43:06.655
and get out of here.

43:06.657 --> 43:09.624
All right, and, uh, what
about your expedition?

43:09.626 --> 43:12.195
Let's deal
with these guys first.

43:12.197 --> 43:14.298
Fair enough.

43:23.340 --> 43:25.007
They didn't break.

43:25.009 --> 43:27.175
- Oh, thank God.
- Helena!

43:27.177 --> 43:29.311
Oh, my God.

43:29.313 --> 43:32.248
Oh, I thought you
weren't coming back.

43:32.250 --> 43:35.452
- Bennie, you're okay!
- Barely.

43:35.454 --> 43:36.318
Hey.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.987
Oh, not in your lifetime.

43:37.989 --> 43:40.856
Okay, look, I can't imagine
they're far behind, so.

43:40.858 --> 43:42.425
I only saw
the ten of them.

43:42.427 --> 43:44.260
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

43:44.262 --> 43:46.128
They seem well trained
for villagers.

43:46.130 --> 43:48.298
What, did I miss something?

43:48.300 --> 43:51.467
Tim hasn't exactly been,
um, forthcoming about

43:51.469 --> 43:52.867
what he's gotten us into.

43:52.869 --> 43:54.638
That's putting it mildly.

43:56.072 --> 43:58.608
So, you know what...

43:58.610 --> 44:01.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:01.012 --> 44:03.648
Should have seen
that one coming.

44:06.583 --> 44:07.615
Stick this.

44:07.617 --> 44:09.050
Damnit, Tim.
If they wanted us dead,

44:09.052 --> 44:10.420
they would have
killed us by now.

44:10.422 --> 44:12.921
That would be ill advised.

44:12.923 --> 44:15.090
Enough.

44:15.092 --> 44:17.659
We mean you no harm.

44:17.661 --> 44:19.295
You killed Isabelle.

44:19.297 --> 44:21.432
That was an unfortunate
accident.

44:35.079 --> 44:37.315
You have your mother's eyes.

44:39.717 --> 44:41.787
But you must tell me...

44:45.389 --> 44:48.157
Why did she name you Alabama?

44:48.159 --> 44:49.958
How do you know my mother?

44:49.960 --> 44:54.429
She came here a long time ago.

44:54.431 --> 44:57.700
Very much the way
that you are here now.

44:57.702 --> 45:01.271
She was asking
for safe passage.

45:01.273 --> 45:03.539
And she offered to perform
a service

45:03.541 --> 45:06.208
that we have yet to complete.

45:06.210 --> 45:08.577
Finding the
Heart of the Dragon?

45:08.579 --> 45:12.481
It is more than just
a simple treasure.

45:12.483 --> 45:15.918
It is the power behind
the Qin Dynasty,

45:15.920 --> 45:19.688
and a tool for unification.

45:19.690 --> 45:21.391
A tool?

45:21.393 --> 45:24.427
Emperor Qin accomplished
more than any emperor

45:24.429 --> 45:26.295
before or after him.

45:26.297 --> 45:30.200
The legacy of his reign
surpassed that of Alexander,

45:30.202 --> 45:35.570
Genghis Kahn, Rome, and even
the early monarchs of Europe.

45:35.572 --> 45:38.675
It wasn't until World War I
when the foundations

45:38.677 --> 45:39.909
began to crack.

45:39.911 --> 45:42.378
He is correct.

45:42.380 --> 45:46.282
And now the world is
in turmoil once again.

45:46.284 --> 45:48.851
And the Chinese people
need to be unified

45:48.853 --> 45:50.418
if we are to survive this.

45:50.420 --> 45:53.188
And you think that the
Heart of the Dragon will help?

45:53.190 --> 45:55.425
We know it can.

45:55.427 --> 45:59.394
So... then why did you need
my mother to go get it?

45:59.396 --> 46:01.430
She was an expert.

46:01.432 --> 46:04.766
But you already knew that
before you came here.

46:04.768 --> 46:08.804
You see, the tomb has
seven keys.

46:08.806 --> 46:11.374
Only one of them
leads to the heart.

46:11.376 --> 46:15.478
You must choose wisely,
for if you choose the wrong one,

46:15.480 --> 46:17.146
your fate will end

46:17.148 --> 46:19.784
the same as the people
who opened them.

46:21.251 --> 46:23.619
Now we want to ensure
that the next one

46:23.621 --> 46:27.356
who will attempt...
is truly worthy.

46:27.358 --> 46:31.594
So you've just been chasing
off anyone that gets close by.

46:31.596 --> 46:34.128
Yes. Something like that.

46:34.130 --> 46:36.831
You knew about this.

46:36.833 --> 46:38.900
You brought us in here
knowing full well

46:38.902 --> 46:40.403
we could have been killed.

46:40.405 --> 46:42.604
Yeah, that would have
an unfortunate circumstances.

46:42.606 --> 46:44.840
- Do you care about anything?
- Enough.

46:44.842 --> 46:47.010
- Ally, you can't seriously...
- Look, that's enough.

46:47.012 --> 46:49.280
We're here now.
That's what matters.

46:50.981 --> 46:55.284
So, you're saying that
my mother offered to help you.

46:55.286 --> 46:56.586
Yes.

46:56.588 --> 46:59.755
And what did you
offer her in return?

46:59.757 --> 47:02.557
- Safe passage.
- That worked out great.

47:02.559 --> 47:04.258
And anything that
she wants

47:04.260 --> 47:07.963
except for
the Heart of the Dragon.

47:07.965 --> 47:13.302
She was particularly interested
in a jade key, nothing else.

47:13.304 --> 47:14.936
Come on, Ally.
We don't need these guys.

47:14.938 --> 47:17.305
Do you know which
the last viable key is?

47:17.307 --> 47:19.441
Well, no, but we can
just try them all, can't we?

47:19.443 --> 47:22.043
No.
I'm not willing to risk it.

47:22.045 --> 47:23.878
Yeah, and I didn't put
this whole thing together only

47:23.880 --> 47:25.280
to hand it over to a group
of savages, okay?

47:25.282 --> 47:26.916
We don't need them.

47:26.918 --> 47:28.717
Wait, you have kept us in the
dark since the very beginning.

47:28.719 --> 47:30.286
Why should we do
anything you say?

47:30.288 --> 47:31.987
Your presence here
is a favor, okay?

47:31.989 --> 47:33.889
You are rapidly becoming more
of a problem than you're worth.

47:33.891 --> 47:36.191
Oh, I'm so sorry that you
sent me into a death trap.

47:36.193 --> 47:37.492
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

47:37.494 --> 47:38.827
- This is ridiculous.
- Okay. Okay.

47:38.829 --> 47:41.229
This is a good time for
everybody to chill.

47:41.231 --> 47:43.231
Breathe in, breathe out.

47:43.233 --> 47:44.398
Don't tell me how to breathe.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.802
He is correct again.

47:46.804 --> 47:49.771
We are all tired.
Exhausted.

47:49.773 --> 47:52.242
Why don't we all
get some rest

47:52.244 --> 47:55.579
and we'll talk about it
in the morning.

48:12.130 --> 48:14.630
Can't sleep?

48:14.632 --> 48:16.197
Yeah.

48:16.199 --> 48:19.467
Once I'm on, it's a little
hard to turn it off.

48:19.469 --> 48:22.039
Yeah. I know what you mean.

48:24.842 --> 48:25.974
I'm good.

48:25.976 --> 48:27.444
More for me.

48:30.114 --> 48:33.682
- Can I ask you something?
- What's up?

48:33.684 --> 48:35.284
Do you think that
we're getting into

48:35.286 --> 48:36.818
something really dangerous?

48:36.820 --> 48:39.153
- Yeah, probably.
- Yeah.

48:39.155 --> 48:43.626
But I get paid regardless
of how this turns out, so...

48:43.628 --> 48:46.298
Is it really all
about money for you?

48:47.498 --> 48:49.632
We've had this conversation.

48:49.634 --> 48:52.568
Nathan, wait.
I'm sorry.

48:52.570 --> 48:54.570
I'm not here to lecture you.

48:54.572 --> 48:58.740
I just really want
to find the Heart.

48:58.742 --> 49:00.409
It was my mother's dream
to find it

49:00.411 --> 49:04.813
and return it to the rightful
owners, the people of China.

49:04.815 --> 49:07.950
Does it really mean
that much to you?

49:07.952 --> 49:11.820
It's the reason
I'm an archeologist.

49:11.822 --> 49:13.488
The only reason I'm even here

49:13.490 --> 49:15.693
is because you found
her notebook.

49:18.929 --> 49:23.999
Well, look, I think we
find ourselves in a

49:24.001 --> 49:27.936
"the sooner we get out of here
the better" situation.

49:27.938 --> 49:29.472
Yeah.

49:29.474 --> 49:33.345
If that means helping you find
the Heart, then I'm in 100%.

49:36.547 --> 49:37.981
Thank you.

49:43.186 --> 49:44.655
Cheers.

49:49.260 --> 49:50.925
Ugh.

49:50.927 --> 49:52.496
Stop it.

49:54.498 --> 49:56.067
See you in the morning.

50:10.581 --> 50:12.514
I see a decision
has been made?

50:12.516 --> 50:13.816
Yeah. Not by me.

50:13.818 --> 50:15.418
We all need to work
together to find

50:15.420 --> 50:17.318
the Heart of the Dragon,
or no one does.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.887
I just don't believe that it
should be locked away forever.

50:19.889 --> 50:22.190
Okay, a relic like that should
be shared with the world,

50:22.192 --> 50:23.992
not just its homeland.

50:23.994 --> 50:27.963
You will see in due time
why it can only belong to us.

50:27.965 --> 50:30.132
- Is that a threat?
- All right, calm down.

50:30.134 --> 50:32.068
Getting all hot and bothered
is not gonna help us

50:32.070 --> 50:33.269
find the Heart.

50:33.271 --> 50:34.639
He's right.

50:36.407 --> 50:38.109
Let's do this.

50:46.483 --> 50:48.516
- Spider.
- What?

50:48.518 --> 50:50.318
Aw, thanks, stud.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.887
Oh yeah?

50:51.889 --> 50:54.055
I do that sort of thing
all the time. Spiders and...

50:54.057 --> 50:55.891
Okay, watch it
with the macho talk.

50:55.893 --> 50:57.358
You're going
to turn me straight.

50:57.360 --> 50:59.028
Really?

50:59.030 --> 51:01.463
No, not really.

51:01.465 --> 51:03.697
But I'm happy
to ease your mind, kid.

51:03.699 --> 51:05.066
- Helena?
- What?

51:05.068 --> 51:07.003
- Can you come help a sec?
- Yeah.

51:07.005 --> 51:08.773
I'm having trouble
with this symbol.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.974
Excuse me.

51:11.976 --> 51:16.211
- Oh, looks, uh...
- Hey, we need to talk.

51:16.213 --> 51:17.612
Oh-oh.

51:17.614 --> 51:19.081
You breaking up with me?

51:19.083 --> 51:22.385
I saw you getting chummy
with Ally last night.

51:22.387 --> 51:25.086
Don't forget you work for me.

51:25.088 --> 51:29.724
The Heart and
its payday are mine.

51:29.726 --> 51:33.695
Yeah, and, uh, what if
I change my mind?

51:33.697 --> 51:35.697
Then I'll just have
to alert the authorities

51:35.699 --> 51:37.833
of your
black market dealings.

51:37.835 --> 51:40.235
Every country in the world
would fight for the opportunity

51:40.237 --> 51:42.604
to have you in their prison.

51:42.606 --> 51:46.508
So, you'll help me...
and <i>only me...</i>

51:46.510 --> 51:48.179
take the Heart.

51:50.047 --> 51:52.180
- You are a son of a...
- Good.

51:52.182 --> 51:54.885
I'm glad we could
reach an agreement.

51:59.389 --> 52:01.023
- No, this one.
- Yeah?

52:01.025 --> 52:03.092
I think that's
where we're going.

52:03.094 --> 52:04.825
This way.

52:04.827 --> 52:07.731
Hey, Ally. Helena.
Wait up.

52:11.534 --> 52:13.605
Jian, any thoughts?

52:16.405 --> 52:18.440
Well, I'm afraid

52:18.442 --> 52:19.840
the only paths that I know

52:19.842 --> 52:22.045
are the ones
that are blocked.

52:23.648 --> 52:25.847
Up down, all around
which way will you go?

52:25.849 --> 52:28.586
That which is above us
so often as below.

52:30.086 --> 52:31.623
This way.

52:35.391 --> 52:37.227
- Look.
- Oh.

52:39.697 --> 52:42.197
Those are completely
rusted through.

52:42.199 --> 52:44.833
Tread carefully, little one,
look down at all you see.

52:44.835 --> 52:47.869
Three times you'll jump back
and then be home free.

52:47.871 --> 52:49.737
What on earth could that mean?

52:49.739 --> 52:51.072
It's an old poem.

52:51.074 --> 52:53.010
It means...

52:56.079 --> 52:57.748
...that...

53:02.152 --> 53:03.688
...we...

53:06.556 --> 53:08.892
Made it.

53:25.909 --> 53:27.775
Did I tell you?

53:27.777 --> 53:29.744
Ally, you did it.
You found it.

53:29.746 --> 53:32.581
I take back every
doubt I ever had.

53:32.583 --> 53:34.318
You doubted me?

53:36.519 --> 53:37.952
Great.

53:37.954 --> 53:39.822
Let's not waste any more time.

53:39.824 --> 53:41.960
But wait...

53:43.327 --> 53:46.195
We must let the Heart
know that you are not here

53:46.197 --> 53:47.963
for monetary gain.

53:47.965 --> 53:51.400
Ally, you must recite
from the Tao

53:51.402 --> 53:53.836
the phrase of
the Heart of the warrior.

53:53.838 --> 53:56.737
Oh, come on.

53:56.739 --> 53:58.742
Ally, repeat after me.

54:21.632 --> 54:23.130
Perfect.

54:23.132 --> 54:26.103
Ms. Channing,
you may enter.

54:27.804 --> 54:29.637
You're not coming with us?

54:29.639 --> 54:31.639
I'm afraid our
part in this tale

54:31.641 --> 54:33.374
has come to an end for now.

54:33.376 --> 54:36.644
But I also believe
that you and your team,

54:36.646 --> 54:39.116
your parts are
just unfolding.

55:07.378 --> 55:09.744
Good luck, Ms. Channing.

55:09.746 --> 55:11.882
You're gonna need it.

55:14.318 --> 55:15.684
Onwards.

55:15.686 --> 55:17.485
Let's see...

55:17.487 --> 55:19.420
One, two, which can it be?

55:19.422 --> 55:22.691
Choose wrong and
beware the poison beneath.

55:22.693 --> 55:24.492
And there's a question mark?

55:24.494 --> 55:28.630
Well, that says poison,
so I vote not that way.

55:28.632 --> 55:31.365
Great.

55:31.367 --> 55:33.135
You're sure it's safe
to be down here?

55:33.137 --> 55:36.037
No, but if we use the right
entrance,

55:36.039 --> 55:38.507
we should be fine.

55:48.219 --> 55:50.586
This is going to be a theme.

55:50.588 --> 55:52.387
Okay.

55:52.389 --> 55:57.226
So, given our only way
forward now is through poison,

55:57.228 --> 56:01.563
do you have any kind of strategy
in case this gets worse?

56:01.565 --> 56:04.233
Yeah, keep moving forward
to the last available entrance

56:04.235 --> 56:05.967
because we can't sit
around waiting to die.

56:05.969 --> 56:07.603
What do you think?

56:07.605 --> 56:10.271
Simple, elegant.

56:10.273 --> 56:11.509
Yeah, I like it.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.766
Did we do it?

56:37.768 --> 56:39.034
Did we find the tomb?

56:39.036 --> 56:40.438
Does this look like
a tomb to you?

56:41.538 --> 56:42.771
Watch out for traps.

56:42.773 --> 56:44.340
The door was labeled
for a reason.

56:44.342 --> 56:47.278
This cave might be old,
but poison is poison.

56:50.280 --> 56:53.581
Looking like a first-timer,
there, Carter.

56:53.583 --> 56:57.519
It's just been a while since
I've been in a place like this.

56:57.521 --> 56:59.720
Forgot what it felt like.

56:59.722 --> 57:01.322
I know what you mean.

57:01.324 --> 57:03.791
This one's probably been on
your list for a while?

57:03.793 --> 57:05.126
You have no idea.

57:05.128 --> 57:07.130
You could say that again.

57:11.601 --> 57:14.302
Every culture has elements
of storytelling.

57:14.304 --> 57:16.972
I feel like if I can decipher
and record those stories

57:16.974 --> 57:18.474
for the next generation,

57:18.476 --> 57:20.541
they can learn from them
and be better for it.

57:20.543 --> 57:22.677
It's what made me want
to study linguistics.

57:22.679 --> 57:24.579
I feel the same about dirt.

57:24.581 --> 57:26.682
Are you serious?

57:26.684 --> 57:28.516
Every rock, every tree ring,

57:28.518 --> 57:30.519
they all have a story
to tell, you know.

57:30.521 --> 57:32.119
Yeah, I mean...

57:32.121 --> 57:33.488
Oh, let me guess.

57:33.490 --> 57:34.856
You pay people to sit
around your mansion

57:34.858 --> 57:36.191
and tell you stories.

57:36.193 --> 57:38.726
Hey, I may not be
an academic,

57:38.728 --> 57:40.561
but I have
traveled the world.

57:40.563 --> 57:44.432
Look, if you must know,
I was just going to say

57:44.434 --> 57:46.367
that I find this place to be one
of the most fascinating things

57:46.369 --> 57:47.836
I've ever seen in my life.

57:47.838 --> 57:51.740
But, excuse me.

57:51.742 --> 57:53.311
Kind of strong.

57:57.114 --> 57:59.081
So besides
the Heart of the Dragon,

57:59.083 --> 58:00.648
I've heard there's
some other treasure

58:00.650 --> 58:02.851
hidden in here somewhere.

58:02.853 --> 58:04.251
Don't get any ideas.

58:04.253 --> 58:07.423
All relics belong to
their rightful people.

58:07.425 --> 58:11.291
You mean the people letting
us risk our lives for them?

58:11.293 --> 58:12.894
What about the history
behind it?

58:12.896 --> 58:14.496
What about the people who need
and deserve these relics?

58:14.498 --> 58:15.729
All right, listen.

58:15.731 --> 58:17.465
There's no difference
between you and I, okay?

58:17.467 --> 58:18.900
You just think that
people are deserving

58:18.902 --> 58:20.568
just because they're poor.

58:20.570 --> 58:23.204
That doesn't make you a hero.
That makes you naive.

58:23.206 --> 58:26.008
Wow. You are full of it.

58:26.010 --> 58:27.708
I shouldn't even be
surprised by now.

58:27.710 --> 58:29.378
Listen, your majesty.

58:29.380 --> 58:31.679
Being smart and beautiful
isn't always going to help you

58:31.681 --> 58:33.682
if you can't take
care of yourself.

58:33.684 --> 58:36.083
Thank you so much
for your veiled concern,

58:36.085 --> 58:38.088
but I think I'm just fine.

58:41.757 --> 58:43.426
Smooth.

59:01.177 --> 59:02.911
That was a close call.

59:02.913 --> 59:05.646
Phew.

59:05.648 --> 59:07.684
Careful.

59:18.762 --> 59:19.862
What? What? What?
What?

59:19.864 --> 59:21.162
What? What?

59:21.164 --> 59:23.831
No, Bennie.

59:23.833 --> 59:25.032
Poisoned dart.

59:25.034 --> 59:27.302
Oh no.

59:27.304 --> 59:30.708
Bennie, it's gonna
be okay, stay with me!

59:33.143 --> 59:36.447
Do something. Anything!

59:37.313 --> 59:39.416
We need to help him.

59:42.952 --> 59:45.153
It's too late.

59:45.155 --> 59:47.124
There's nothing we can do.

01:00:01.003 --> 01:00:03.173
I'm so sorry.

01:00:04.375 --> 01:00:07.041
Look, I know that this is

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:08.376
not what you want
to hear right now,

01:00:08.378 --> 01:00:10.244
but we really must
press forward.

01:00:10.246 --> 01:00:12.414
The Heart obviously isn't here,

01:00:12.416 --> 01:00:15.619
and we don't know how many other
poisonous darts are around.

01:00:18.688 --> 01:00:20.458
We've gotta go.

01:00:52.655 --> 01:00:53.921
Nice.

01:00:53.923 --> 01:00:55.356
This doesn't look right.

01:00:55.358 --> 01:00:56.825
We need to go down.

01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:58.760
How do we do that?

01:00:58.762 --> 01:00:59.961
Give me the notebook.

01:00:59.963 --> 01:01:01.530
What? No.

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.063
Okay, then give me the map.

01:01:03.065 --> 01:01:04.633
No way.

01:01:04.635 --> 01:01:06.300
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to your friend,

01:01:06.302 --> 01:01:08.237
okay, but we need a clear
head moving forward.

01:01:08.239 --> 01:01:09.369
Let me take point
for a little bit.

01:01:09.371 --> 01:01:12.441
It's not a terrible idea.

01:01:12.443 --> 01:01:14.610
Maybe you should
just give it to him.

01:01:14.612 --> 01:01:17.077
Are you serious?

01:01:17.079 --> 01:01:18.481
Come on, give it to me.

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.650
Fine, Colombo.

01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:23.050
Thank you.

01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:25.088
Let's move.

01:01:34.664 --> 01:01:38.066
Tim, hold up.
It's not safe.

01:01:38.068 --> 01:01:39.470
Just let him go.

01:01:40.737 --> 01:01:42.903
I can't believe
Bennie's gone.

01:01:42.905 --> 01:01:45.273
He was just a kid.

01:01:45.275 --> 01:01:47.742
Look, you couldn't
have known

01:01:47.744 --> 01:01:51.179
that was going
to happen to him.

01:01:51.181 --> 01:01:53.115
None of us could.

01:01:53.117 --> 01:01:55.117
She's right.

01:01:55.119 --> 01:01:56.684
Once the poison hits
the bloodstream,

01:01:56.686 --> 01:01:58.455
there's nothing you
can do about it.

01:02:06.963 --> 01:02:09.565
Hey...

01:02:12.436 --> 01:02:14.238
I miss him, too.

01:02:16.706 --> 01:02:19.742
I know he was a nerd,
but he was our nerd.

01:02:29.219 --> 01:02:30.517
Let's just go.

01:02:30.519 --> 01:02:32.353
I can't do this anymore.

01:02:32.355 --> 01:02:34.157
What do you mean?

01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:38.458
Tim set up the whole thing

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.628
so that he can get
the Heart for himself.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:43.731
He thinks that because
it was Emperor Qin's

01:02:43.733 --> 01:02:46.767
it's got some sort of,
I don't know, like

01:02:46.769 --> 01:02:49.637
mystical power that's gonna
make him wildly rich.

01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.505
- I...
- That's crazy.

01:02:51.507 --> 01:02:52.807
- I called it.
- Yeah.

01:02:52.809 --> 01:02:54.610
I knew we
couldn't trust him.

01:02:54.612 --> 01:02:55.642
Son of a...

01:02:55.644 --> 01:02:58.345
How long have
you known about this?

01:02:58.347 --> 01:03:00.816
Ally, why do you
think I'm here?

01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:03.083
So you've been helping
him this entire time.

01:03:03.085 --> 01:03:04.686
Yeah.

01:03:04.688 --> 01:03:06.487
But that's what
I'm trying to tell you

01:03:06.489 --> 01:03:09.923
is that I can't
do it anymore.

01:03:09.925 --> 01:03:13.061
Yeah, sure.

01:03:13.063 --> 01:03:15.563
This changes nothing.

01:03:15.565 --> 01:03:18.032
Hold on, did... you heard me
say that the only reason

01:03:18.034 --> 01:03:19.668
we're doing this is
to make him rich,

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:21.568
like, why would we continue?

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.104
Yeah, I heard you say that.

01:03:23.106 --> 01:03:24.572
I was standing right here.

01:03:24.574 --> 01:03:28.543
God, you are cute for a guy,
but you are dense.

01:03:28.545 --> 01:03:30.010
All right, let me spell
this out for you.

01:03:30.012 --> 01:03:32.680
Just because he commissioned us
to collect the Heart

01:03:32.682 --> 01:03:37.385
and give it to him, doesn't
mean that we're going to...

01:03:37.387 --> 01:03:40.688
To give him
the Heart of the Dragon.

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.557
Of course Tim is just
in it for himself.

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:43.761
Guys like that always are.

01:03:47.364 --> 01:03:48.929
So you two have known
about this the whole time.

01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:52.032
- Not specifically but...
- I had an inkling.

01:03:52.034 --> 01:03:55.970
Okay, can't fool
the famous Alabama Channing.

01:03:55.972 --> 01:03:57.438
Got it.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.940
Why do guys always assume
that they have

01:03:58.942 --> 01:04:00.041
more information than us?

01:04:00.043 --> 01:04:02.376
- Thank you, though.
- Mm.

01:04:02.378 --> 01:04:05.479
But that confession was
really cute, though.

01:04:05.481 --> 01:04:07.315
Yeah, yeah.
Laugh it up.

01:04:07.317 --> 01:04:08.452
Real cool.

01:04:19.563 --> 01:04:21.599
I'm close.
It's close.

01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:27.270
Okay, okay.

01:04:37.514 --> 01:04:40.849
So what was your
counter plan?

01:04:40.851 --> 01:04:42.516
Tim doesn't know
that we need a key,

01:04:42.518 --> 01:04:45.519
so if we find it before he does,
we have a leg up.

01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:48.190
Oh, that's right.
This mythical key.

01:04:48.192 --> 01:04:49.858
A myth... what?

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.461
My mom was convinced that
we needed a key to get

01:04:53.463 --> 01:04:55.597
into the Heart
of the Dragon, so,

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:59.333
it might not actually
be a real key.

01:04:59.335 --> 01:05:00.901
That's helpful.

01:05:00.903 --> 01:05:04.474
It could be a combination,
a code, a tool, something.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:08.512
We can't let him
get too far ahead.

01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:23.960
This way.

01:05:38.842 --> 01:05:40.443
Whoa.

01:05:43.447 --> 01:05:44.579
Man...

01:05:44.581 --> 01:05:46.213
This is dope.

01:05:46.215 --> 01:05:48.318
What do we have here?

01:05:52.355 --> 01:05:53.755
First find.

01:05:53.757 --> 01:05:57.494
Oh, come on.
Let me see that.

01:06:13.976 --> 01:06:15.545
Ally?

01:06:21.684 --> 01:06:23.820
Is that your mom?

01:06:25.088 --> 01:06:27.658
She was here.

01:06:33.362 --> 01:06:35.732
I knew so little of her.

01:06:38.235 --> 01:06:41.001
I was only five
when she died.

01:06:41.003 --> 01:06:43.972
She's been leaving traces
of herself behind

01:06:43.974 --> 01:06:46.076
that I've been
finding my whole life.

01:06:47.376 --> 01:06:49.677
Like what?

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:53.116
She loved puzzles and
games even more than I did.

01:06:55.952 --> 01:06:58.519
Every day I'd wake up and
she'd have one for me,

01:06:58.521 --> 01:07:00.157
even when she was going
on a dig.

01:07:02.326 --> 01:07:05.459
Even when she died,
more would come.

01:07:05.461 --> 01:07:06.597
And...

01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:12.700
I think that I used it
to pretend

01:07:12.702 --> 01:07:13.969
that she never left.

01:07:13.971 --> 01:07:17.771
But I always knew
that she was gone.

01:07:17.773 --> 01:07:20.242
Well, it sounds like
she really loved you.

01:07:20.244 --> 01:07:21.845
Yeah.

01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:26.049
I like to
think that she did.

01:07:29.251 --> 01:07:32.854
That's why I was so happy
to get her notebook.

01:07:32.856 --> 01:07:35.959
I was so willing to come here
and put everybody in danger.

01:07:46.902 --> 01:07:49.739
Well, it looks like she gave
you one last puzzle to solve.

01:08:02.052 --> 01:08:03.784
Hey.

01:08:03.786 --> 01:08:06.088
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just found a locket.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.059
Are you okay?

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.358
Yeah.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.892
Cool,

01:08:12.894 --> 01:08:14.095
'cause I think you're
really gonna dig this.

01:08:14.097 --> 01:08:15.831
Come on.

01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:17.698
Okay,

01:08:17.701 --> 01:08:20.301
so, this looks
like Cantonese,

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:21.968
but it's way more primitive.

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:23.904
I think it's pre-Cantonese,
the way that Latin

01:08:23.907 --> 01:08:25.473
is pre-Italian or Spanish...

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:27.274
Hey, this isn't helping.
Come on.

01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:30.812
All this to say I think
I've got it figured out.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:34.648
Stone, storm, fire,

01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:36.817
sun, warrior,

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:39.187
I think moon, because sun.

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:40.421
And get this.

01:08:40.423 --> 01:08:42.189
Heart.

01:08:42.192 --> 01:08:43.390
The Heart of the Dragon.

01:08:43.393 --> 01:08:46.727
Last thing my mom says.

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:48.929
Not his ego nor pills nor vice,
little one, little one.

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:52.032
Not once nor twice nor thrice,
little one, little one.

01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:54.134
But four times as nice said
the hawk to the mice.

01:08:54.136 --> 01:08:56.303
And four times as fun
the bird loudly enticed.

01:08:56.305 --> 01:08:59.139
Zheng's better advice
was his most concise.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.813
When she wrote my last gift
she was also my goodbye.

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:08.616
The Heart...

01:09:08.618 --> 01:09:10.720
of the Dragon.
It must be the heart.

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:16.756
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, are...

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:18.926
are you sure about that?

01:09:18.929 --> 01:09:21.428
What does she mean
"my last gift to you

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.163
is also my last goodbye"?

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:25.165
I don't know.
That's the last of the riddle.

01:09:25.167 --> 01:09:28.602
Also, why did he have you
recite the Tao of the warrior

01:09:28.604 --> 01:09:30.370
if we're looking for a heart?

01:09:30.372 --> 01:09:33.139
Hey, Tao of the warrior.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.908
Is that the warrior?

01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:36.277
That's the same symbol.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:38.345
My last gift to you
is my last goodbye.

01:09:38.346 --> 01:09:42.286
That... I think she wrote
this before she died.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.307
Oh!

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:08.912
Wow.

01:10:37.039 --> 01:10:38.140
Helena!

01:10:52.154 --> 01:10:53.620
Come on.

01:10:57.226 --> 01:10:59.863
- Oh, my whole body hurts.
- Helena?

01:11:04.567 --> 01:11:06.000
Ah, God!

01:11:06.002 --> 01:11:07.835
I'm sorry.
I heard you crying.

01:11:07.837 --> 01:11:10.237
I got the wind knocked out of me.
I was like "Don't be sad."

01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:13.375
Oh, my God, don't do
that to me ever again.

01:11:13.377 --> 01:11:14.741
Sorry.

01:11:14.743 --> 01:11:17.344
This guy was about
to be my only friend.

01:11:17.346 --> 01:11:18.412
Only?

01:11:18.414 --> 01:11:19.613
We're friends now?

01:11:19.615 --> 01:11:21.217
Shut up, just help me
get her up.

01:11:23.453 --> 01:11:26.120
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- I'm sorry. You okay?

01:11:26.122 --> 01:11:28.054
Uh, yeah.

01:11:28.056 --> 01:11:29.357
I think I hurt my leg.

01:11:29.359 --> 01:11:31.392
I don't think
I can walk on it.

01:11:31.394 --> 01:11:33.594
Well, you have to.
I'm not just leaving you here.

01:11:33.596 --> 01:11:34.961
Oh yes, you are.

01:11:34.963 --> 01:11:36.196
That jerkface Tim has
probably got

01:11:36.198 --> 01:11:37.432
the Heart of the Dragon
at this point.

01:11:37.434 --> 01:11:38.433
I'm not leaving you here

01:11:38.435 --> 01:11:39.733
to die like my mother did, okay?

01:11:39.735 --> 01:11:41.268
Whoa, who said
anything about dying?

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.603
I'm just gonna like,
I don't know, hang out,

01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:45.274
like read a book or something.

01:11:46.775 --> 01:11:48.041
Oh, my God, go.

01:11:48.043 --> 01:11:50.447
Please don't do
anything stupid.

01:11:52.414 --> 01:11:54.251
You, too, lover boy.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.196
Doesn't that say warrior?

01:12:10.198 --> 01:12:11.331
Yeah, that's what I don't get.

01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:12.767
Every myth that
I've ever heard,

01:12:12.769 --> 01:12:13.767
it's been
the Heart of the Dragon.

01:12:13.769 --> 01:12:14.968
This might not be it.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.269
Well, maybe they
got it wrong.

01:12:16.271 --> 01:12:17.470
No, I think the
Heart of the Dragon

01:12:17.472 --> 01:12:18.472
is still here somewhere.

01:12:18.474 --> 01:12:19.976
Shall we go find that?

01:12:21.478 --> 01:12:23.710
Tim?

01:12:23.712 --> 01:12:25.181
I think it's in here.

01:12:26.248 --> 01:12:27.915
Tim.

01:12:27.917 --> 01:12:30.084
Did you find it?

01:12:30.086 --> 01:12:31.485
Did you find the heart?

01:12:31.487 --> 01:12:33.220
What?

01:12:33.222 --> 01:12:35.356
That's it, that's the heart.

01:12:35.358 --> 01:12:37.424
Use it to open the tomb.

01:12:37.426 --> 01:12:39.227
You just have
to repeat the phrase.

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:40.661
Tim, I think that
we all should go.

01:12:40.663 --> 01:12:41.995
It's really dangerous.

01:12:41.997 --> 01:12:43.798
Helena just got hit
by a bunch of rocks.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.532
Without going inside,
are you crazy?

01:12:45.534 --> 01:12:47.067
Hey.

01:12:47.069 --> 01:12:50.638
Tim, why don't we just take
a minutes to calm down.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.442
Power.

01:12:54.444 --> 01:12:55.809
Give it to me.

01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:57.344
No.

01:12:57.346 --> 01:12:58.879
I said give it to me.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.848
What do you think
that you're doing?

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:03.750
Did you forget who
you work for?

01:13:03.752 --> 01:13:05.385
You work for me.

01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:06.352
Let him go.

01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:08.022
This is not yours
for the taking.

01:13:08.024 --> 01:13:09.589
Well, see,
that's where you're wrong.

01:13:09.591 --> 01:13:11.125
It is mine for the taking.

01:13:11.127 --> 01:13:14.995
I've worked too hard
and for too long to just let you

01:13:14.997 --> 01:13:16.865
walk out of here with it.

01:13:16.867 --> 01:13:18.866
Tim, this belongs to
the people of China,

01:13:18.868 --> 01:13:20.101
and you know it.

01:13:20.103 --> 01:13:21.501
What are they gonna do
with it, huh?

01:13:21.503 --> 01:13:22.771
Nothing.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:23.937
They're gonna put it
on display

01:13:23.939 --> 01:13:25.106
when it could be
making them rich.

01:13:25.108 --> 01:13:26.406
You're acting insane.

01:13:26.408 --> 01:13:28.075
You're using me,
you're using them.

01:13:28.077 --> 01:13:29.277
Of course I used you.

01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:30.745
What did you think this
was going to be,

01:13:30.747 --> 01:13:33.147
an all-expense-paid expedition
so that you could

01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:38.785
just relive the dreams
of your dead mother?

01:13:38.787 --> 01:13:42.624
I don't have all day, Al.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.494
Ow!

01:14:02.878 --> 01:14:05.347
Oh, this just got weird.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.521
We should go.

01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:57.560
Is that what I think it is?

01:15:58.728 --> 01:16:00.931
Yeah.

01:16:03.832 --> 01:16:05.967
It's, uh...

01:16:05.969 --> 01:16:08.268
It's the Heart of the Dragon.

01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:11.039
That is a cool sword.

01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:14.275
I spent my entire
life researching this.

01:16:14.277 --> 01:16:16.947
It was the Emperor's sword
all along.

01:16:28.323 --> 01:16:32.392
Okay.
Glad you found it, let's go.

01:16:32.394 --> 01:16:35.662
- We need to get Helena.
- Yeah.

01:16:36.666 --> 01:16:38.101
Whoa!

01:16:45.073 --> 01:16:47.574
Do you feel that?

01:16:47.576 --> 01:16:50.143
I think it's following
the jade heart.

01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:56.016
Well, way to choose wisely,
my chosen one.

01:16:56.018 --> 01:16:57.354
Shut up.

01:17:05.795 --> 01:17:07.093
Why is the cave shaking?

01:17:07.095 --> 01:17:08.862
I don't know, but look
what I found.

01:17:08.864 --> 01:17:10.430
- Is that the...
- Yes, it is.

01:17:10.432 --> 01:17:11.898
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, you found it.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.534
Let's not talk about it here.

01:17:13.536 --> 01:17:14.636
Come on.

01:17:30.453 --> 01:17:32.756
Go! Go!

01:17:54.143 --> 01:17:55.712
That's a sight
for sore eyes.

01:17:58.715 --> 01:18:00.817
Ms. Channing.

01:18:04.752 --> 01:18:06.088
Is that...

01:18:08.323 --> 01:18:13.228
I present
the Heart of the Dragon.

01:18:18.234 --> 01:18:20.570
Can it really be?

01:18:39.622 --> 01:18:41.224
It is.

01:18:43.759 --> 01:18:47.460
I must thank you for
this sacred gift.

01:18:47.462 --> 01:18:49.629
The people of China
will not forget.

01:18:49.631 --> 01:18:54.336
Whatever you desire, is yours.

01:18:55.438 --> 01:18:57.970
What will you do next?

01:18:57.972 --> 01:18:59.004
Well.

01:18:59.006 --> 01:19:00.476
Well, that depends.

01:19:03.813 --> 01:19:05.815
What other hidden relics
you have around here?

01:19:21.497 --> 01:19:23.162
So that's when we
discovered the real key

01:19:23.164 --> 01:19:25.232
wasn't the Heart of the Dragon,

01:19:25.234 --> 01:19:28.235
it was the Heart
of the Warrior.

01:19:28.237 --> 01:19:30.140
As you can see...

01:19:41.384 --> 01:19:43.353
Class dismissed.
