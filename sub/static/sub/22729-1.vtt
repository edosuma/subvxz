00:50.117 --> 00:55.322
You know, Steph, it's not
like I haven't tried, okay?

00:57.425 --> 01:00.793
I never know how you're
gonna react to anything.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.495
I... I... Every single day
is a different emotion,

01:02.497 --> 01:04.431
I come home to a
different situation,

01:04.433 --> 01:08.368
something I have to deal with.
Something that is oppressive.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.504
That's just mentally draining.

01:10.506 --> 01:14.808
Over the past eight months,
I began to realize that,

01:14.810 --> 01:19.913
dating you
has been harder on me

01:19.915 --> 01:22.782
mentally, spiritually,

01:22.784 --> 01:27.854
and every other kind of way that
I could possibly have imagined.

01:27.856 --> 01:31.324
I started smoking.

01:31.326 --> 01:35.262
You can't tell me you had
nothing to do with that.

01:35.264 --> 01:38.598
I never cheated on you.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.235
I know you didn't.
I know.

01:42.237 --> 01:44.238
But there's more to it
than that.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.307
You're an awful person.

01:47.309 --> 01:51.480
Honestly, I mean, I... Your
friends must fucking lie to you

01:51.482 --> 01:53.682
because no one is telling
you the truth.

01:53.684 --> 01:57.718
I'm the one who has to deal
with it every single day. Me.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.289
Your... your mood swings,
your attitudes,

02:00.291 --> 02:02.356
you're being manipulative,
you're selfish.

02:02.358 --> 02:03.525
You treat all your
friends like shit.

02:03.527 --> 02:04.692
That's not true.

02:04.694 --> 02:06.495
You know how you
are with people.

02:06.497 --> 02:09.898
You know that, and...

02:09.900 --> 02:13.570
if I don't get out now,
you're gonna ruin me,

02:13.572 --> 02:15.537
like you ruined all of them.

02:15.539 --> 02:18.740
You said that we were the same.

02:18.742 --> 02:22.345
How could you be
so mean to me?

02:22.347 --> 02:28.284
Stephanie, do you ever think the reason
we don't work is because we are the same?

02:28.286 --> 02:29.918
Same person.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.989
We're both
extremely fucked up.

02:32.991 --> 02:35.960
I'm just gonna nip it in the bud
and tell you how I feel right now,

02:35.962 --> 02:38.429
it's what I'm doing.

02:38.431 --> 02:42.335
And honestly, I think you should, if
anything, you should respect me for that.

02:47.839 --> 02:50.807
Shit.

02:50.809 --> 02:54.414
Can I get my stuff?
I got somewhere I gotta be.

02:56.815 --> 03:00.451
Yeah.

03:00.453 --> 03:01.853
I'll get your stuff.

03:01.855 --> 03:04.923
Thanks.

03:15.001 --> 03:16.938
Hey, would you...
would you relax?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.408
Yes, I know.
I'm doing it now.

03:24.345 --> 03:26.646
Yeah, and in ten minutes
this crazy bitch will be

03:26.648 --> 03:29.448
in the fucking rear-view
mirror, just relax.

03:32.286 --> 03:33.919
Yeah, I know.

03:33.921 --> 03:37.259
I never called you a piece
on the side, so shut up.

03:40.361 --> 03:43.232
Yeah.

04:28.777 --> 04:30.780
Yeah, I love you.

04:56.673 --> 04:58.673
What the fuck?

05:00.779 --> 05:03.380
Are you fucking crazy?

05:38.518 --> 05:43.454
We were perfect together,
Chad.

05:43.456 --> 05:46.992
We could have been
so much more.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.594
Hey! What's up?

06:54.596 --> 06:58.435
I... I really need you.

07:01.705 --> 07:04.508
Okay.

07:16.919 --> 07:19.787
Yeah?

07:19.789 --> 07:22.626
I need you to drop whatever
you're doing and get over here.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.194
What happened?

07:26.196 --> 07:30.132
Something bad, okay?
I just need you.

07:30.134 --> 07:32.701
I'll be there as soon as I can.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.706
Good.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.546
Hey, I like what you
did with your hair.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.283
It's kind of different
and awesome, you know?

07:47.285 --> 07:49.487
Or not.

08:28.061 --> 08:30.597
Okay, Stephanie,
what do you want us to do?

09:41.169 --> 09:44.003
Where should we go?

09:44.005 --> 09:47.009
As far away as possible.

10:59.051 --> 11:04.921
Are we really gonna do this?

11:04.923 --> 11:06.927
Yeah.

11:11.029 --> 11:13.032
Okay.

11:40.126 --> 11:42.194
Are you sure
we're out far enough?

11:42.196 --> 11:45.266
I still see lights out there.

11:48.804 --> 11:52.207
It's the desert,
we're miles away.

13:43.221 --> 13:46.123
Hey.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.026
It's okay.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.627
It's okay.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.980
I told you to fucking
cut the lights.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.616
I left them on so you could... so you
could see what you're doing, okay?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.253
I left them on so you could see what you're doing.

14:14.255 --> 14:17.423
- Son of a bitch.
- What the heck?

14:17.425 --> 14:20.527
Come on,
everything's gonna be fine.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.532
- Come on, let's...
- Don't touch me right now.

14:27.535 --> 14:29.471
Really?

14:33.473 --> 14:37.478
Carrie, come take care
of your friend.

14:52.194 --> 14:54.195
Sorry.

15:11.781 --> 15:13.984
Fuck!
What the fuck?

15:16.318 --> 15:18.218
Fuck it.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.023
What?

15:21.190 --> 15:23.056
- What?
- Don't want to say.

15:23.058 --> 15:24.426
Good for you.

15:26.196 --> 15:29.096
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

15:29.098 --> 15:32.166
I told you to fucking cut
the lights.

15:32.168 --> 15:34.636
Son of a bitch!

15:34.638 --> 15:38.739
Didn't think the battery was gonna die from
leaving the light on for, like, two seconds.

15:38.741 --> 15:42.310
So, uh, what I'm gonna do is, I'm
just gonna hike up to the road,

15:42.312 --> 15:45.346
and I'll hitchhike so...

15:45.348 --> 15:46.681
we can get another car
over here, okay?

15:46.683 --> 15:48.651
No. That's the worst idea.

15:48.653 --> 15:50.552
It's not a bad idea. I mean,
we're just gonna be stuck...

15:50.554 --> 15:53.156
Dave's the idea guy.

15:53.158 --> 15:56.392
Yeah, the idea guy that got our car dead
and now we're in the middle of nowhere.

15:56.394 --> 15:58.461
It's not a bad idea, okay?

15:58.463 --> 16:01.831
They're not going to allow four
people to hitchhike with them, so...

16:01.833 --> 16:03.633
- We shouldn't leave the car...
- No, we... Yeah,

16:03.635 --> 16:06.836
- we're gonna stay together.
- No, Steph. Why don't...

16:06.838 --> 16:08.738
No, no one's staying together,
we can stay here with the car

16:08.740 --> 16:12.076
and some of us can go find
somebody else to jump the car.

16:12.078 --> 16:13.677
No, we're gonna
all stay together...

16:13.679 --> 16:16.245
And stay here? Just hang out,
wait for the body to rot?

16:16.247 --> 16:18.314
No, we're gonna
go together and get a car

16:18.316 --> 16:20.616
and then come back here
and get rid of this mess.

16:20.618 --> 16:22.351
- And just leave the car here?
- Okay?

16:22.353 --> 16:26.658
Together. We are not leaving
each others' sights.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.659
- We can't leave the car
- Great.

16:29.661 --> 16:31.595
We'll come back and jump
the car and we'll go, okay?

16:31.597 --> 16:33.600
Jeb, let's just go.

16:36.636 --> 16:40.704
Okay.
Great. Let's go.

16:40.706 --> 16:43.710
Do you need a light?

16:46.213 --> 16:48.279
Thank you very much.

16:48.281 --> 16:51.515
Just go.

16:51.517 --> 16:53.852
- It's a good idea, Jeb.
- Here we go.

16:53.854 --> 16:56.588
The sooner we get this done, the
sooner we can stop complaining

16:56.590 --> 16:59.593
and go back to our normal lives.

17:01.361 --> 17:02.363
Let's go.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.214
I know this is messed up,
but this isn't... this isn't her,

17:22.215 --> 17:23.582
this is just an off day.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.584
- An off day?
- Yeah.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.186
An off day? Carrie,
she just buried a body.

17:28.189 --> 17:30.189
I mean, it's not like that
happens all the time.

17:30.191 --> 17:32.792
Jeb, she is my friend.
She's my best friend.

17:32.794 --> 17:35.262
I mean, we have to support her.

17:35.264 --> 17:38.798
I get that you two are close,
I can accept that.

17:38.800 --> 17:44.471
But look, I don't know her shit,
and neither do you. Okay?

17:44.473 --> 17:48.775
I mean, I don't know. All I know is
that she's usually not like this

17:48.777 --> 17:50.710
and she's the only person who's
ever really been there for me.

17:50.712 --> 17:52.245
- She...
- Oh, okay.

17:52.247 --> 17:54.782
Okay, before I met you,
she was the only person.

17:54.784 --> 17:58.285
The only person
who cared about me.

17:58.287 --> 18:01.321
Please can we just trust her?

18:01.323 --> 18:03.623
Please?
Please?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.626
Fine. All right.

18:05.628 --> 18:08.462
If you want to stay here,
that's what we're doing, okay?

18:08.464 --> 18:12.567
But just know,
that I am here for you.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.870
Not her.
All right?

18:14.872 --> 18:18.707
And the minute that bitch tries
to throw you under the bus,

18:18.709 --> 18:20.976
I'm gonna park it on top
of her. You got it?

18:20.978 --> 18:23.312
Got it.

18:23.314 --> 18:24.912
Good.

18:24.914 --> 18:25.947
I love you.

18:25.949 --> 18:28.152
I love you, too.

18:31.255 --> 18:33.257
Come on.

18:34.925 --> 18:36.226
What happened?

18:36.228 --> 18:37.427
What do you mean?

18:37.429 --> 18:40.496
You know,
between you and...

18:40.498 --> 18:42.798
Mister Perfect.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.936
Um, none of your business...
that's what happened.

18:46.938 --> 18:51.774
Well, I think that because maybe the fact
that I'm helping you quite a bit here,

18:51.776 --> 18:54.244
that I deserve to get some
kind of information.

18:54.246 --> 18:57.513
Just the slightest
information, at all.

18:57.515 --> 18:59.382
I just don't want
to talk about it.

18:59.384 --> 19:01.517
Come on, you know I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

19:01.519 --> 19:03.286
I mean, I'm here helping
you out.

19:03.288 --> 19:04.988
We're on the same team.

19:04.990 --> 19:08.558
You don't need to know anything.
If you were in my position,

19:08.560 --> 19:10.361
you'd do the same thing.

19:10.363 --> 19:14.297
So you can
just leave it alone.

19:14.299 --> 19:16.734
Okay, fine, whatever. Just...

19:16.736 --> 19:19.436
No, it's not whatever,
you just drop it.

19:19.438 --> 19:21.505
Stephanie treats Dave
like a puppy.

19:21.507 --> 19:24.843
Yeah, well, he's been warned
and he still does it anyway.

19:24.845 --> 19:28.779
You gotta be nicer to me. I'm not...
I'm not like this other guy.

19:28.781 --> 19:30.417
It's not fair.

19:39.792 --> 19:42.027
What are we gonna do?

19:42.029 --> 19:44.028
I don't know.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.864
I mean, she's not even
acknowledging it.

19:45.866 --> 19:48.334
She's not saying anything.

19:48.336 --> 19:50.603
Hey, if you have something to say,
why don't you say it to my face?

19:50.605 --> 19:52.505
Take it easy, all right?

19:52.507 --> 19:55.540
I think that we should make
some kind of plan.

19:55.542 --> 19:59.377
Okay, when I figure it out,
I'll let you know.

19:59.379 --> 20:02.815
Okay, well, we're waiting,
so any minute now would be nice.

20:02.817 --> 20:06.618
Steph, we can figure out some kind of plan
together before we go back and get a car.

20:06.620 --> 20:09.954
I'm figuring it out, so until
then, shut the hell up!

20:09.956 --> 20:12.392
- Stephanie, we need an alibi, okay?
- Great.

20:12.394 --> 20:13.894
Hear her out. Come on.

20:13.896 --> 20:15.761
Okay, do you have any ideas?

20:15.763 --> 20:19.833
'Cause right now,
you're just complaining.

20:19.835 --> 20:22.568
Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.

20:22.570 --> 20:24.773
You think you do, or you do?

20:26.508 --> 20:30.510
Okay, what if we never left
your house, right?

20:30.512 --> 20:33.847
What if, um,
we were still there?

20:33.849 --> 20:36.384
Having a party or something,
you know, drinking.

20:36.386 --> 20:40.521
We could take pictures to commemorate
whatever we're celebrating.

20:40.523 --> 20:43.590
We can pretend that we were,
I mean, all together.

20:43.592 --> 20:44.959
That's a good idea.

20:44.961 --> 20:46.894
- At your house.
- That's a great idea.

20:46.896 --> 20:49.062
- So...
- Do you still have those beers?

20:49.064 --> 20:50.998
Yeah, it's... gonna...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.367
Brilliant, okay, that's
actually a really good idea.

20:53.369 --> 20:54.635
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, it's great.

20:54.637 --> 20:55.903
- One for you.
- It's really good.

20:55.905 --> 20:57.137
Who's got a camera?

20:57.139 --> 20:58.673
- I do... I have my phone,
- Yeah great.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.008
You want it now? Okay.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.643
- Yeah.
- Turn off your lights.

21:01.645 --> 21:02.977
- Okay.
- Hide the flashlights.

21:02.979 --> 21:06.915
No lights, and, um,
just get our faces.

21:06.917 --> 21:07.916
Yeah, okay.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.417
- Um.
- Um.

21:09.419 --> 21:11.753
No, like, Joshua tree's
in the background.

21:11.755 --> 21:14.490
Okay, everybody in? You guys,
come in closer, Dave.

21:14.492 --> 21:18.830
Okay, one, two, ah!

21:19.897 --> 21:21.929
- Yeah? Again?
- One more.

21:21.931 --> 21:23.532
- You want to do a silly face?
- Yeah.

21:23.534 --> 21:24.801
Okay, one, two,
we're having a party.

21:26.571 --> 21:28.670
We're having a party? Yeah,
this is a great party.

21:28.672 --> 21:30.740
- That's my party face.
- Brilliant.

21:30.742 --> 21:32.175
- All right, perfect.
- It was actually a really good idea.

21:32.177 --> 21:33.609
- Let's go.
- It was brilliant.

21:33.611 --> 21:35.145
- You think so?
- It was really good.

21:35.147 --> 21:38.481
- Yeah, okay.
- You remember, like, three years ago?

21:38.483 --> 21:41.050
When I wasn't in your life? I doubt you
would have had an idea as great as that.

21:41.052 --> 21:42.755
Hmm, probably not.

21:53.498 --> 21:56.499
Steph, can we... can we
just take a break? I just...

21:56.501 --> 21:58.701
We've been walking forever,
I'm just exhausted.

21:58.703 --> 22:01.171
Wait, you're just gonna sit here
in the middle of the desert?

22:01.173 --> 22:06.209
Yeah, it's... We're tired.
Come on, it's... Oh my God,

22:06.211 --> 22:09.914
I'm so tired and cold and we
don't have any water. Just...

22:09.916 --> 22:11.149
- Fine.
- just five minutes.

22:11.151 --> 22:14.218
Fine.

22:14.220 --> 22:16.487
Oh, should we get the boys?

22:16.489 --> 22:22.159
No, they will be fine.

22:25.565 --> 22:27.098
All right,
so I just have to ask,

22:27.100 --> 22:29.868
how did you wind up
chasing after that?

22:29.870 --> 22:32.603
Whatever you think of her, she's
actually pretty awesome, okay?

22:32.605 --> 22:35.041
Really, 'cause awesome people
don't murder their boyfriends.

22:35.043 --> 22:37.677
All right? She could have keyed
his car or burned his clothes,

22:37.679 --> 22:40.712
murder kinda takes it to
a different level.

22:40.714 --> 22:42.113
She's spontaneous.

22:42.115 --> 22:44.749
Why are you always
standing up for her?

22:44.751 --> 22:49.087
Okay, I understand this is an awful
situation but she's bringing us together

22:49.089 --> 22:52.592
and she's keeping us safe. And I
know you only see her in, like, a...

22:52.594 --> 22:55.728
a bad light,
but she's more than that.

22:55.730 --> 22:58.632
You sound like a cult follower.

22:58.634 --> 23:02.268
Jeb, I love that girl.

23:02.270 --> 23:04.604
- I love her.
- Oh.

23:04.606 --> 23:07.607
I know she's crazy but she
goes after what she wants.

23:07.609 --> 23:10.844
- And I'm a part of that.
- Yes! Dave, you are.

23:10.846 --> 23:12.214
You're being used.

23:14.016 --> 23:16.749
All girls are manipulative, Jeb.

23:16.751 --> 23:19.252
And sometimes it's far worse
than this.

23:19.254 --> 23:21.523
You don't want more?

23:22.858 --> 23:25.293
Of course I want more,
but that's...

23:25.295 --> 23:28.695
You know, I'm just trying to
hold on to what I have.

23:28.697 --> 23:31.833
So you just showed
up one day and said,

23:31.835 --> 23:33.166
"Oh, hey,
I'll worship you.

23:33.168 --> 23:34.935
Pick me."

23:34.937 --> 23:37.639
Yep, you're right, Jeb.
You got it right on the nose.

23:37.641 --> 23:40.945
You know something? I've know Carrie
a lot longer than I've known Steph.

23:42.045 --> 23:44.077
My Carrie?

23:44.079 --> 23:45.915
Yeah, we were really close.

23:47.117 --> 23:49.317
But then she introduced
me to Steph,

23:49.319 --> 23:52.054
and then I fell for her.
And she's, yeah...

23:52.056 --> 23:55.994
Oh, well that's a love story
of epic proportions.

23:59.996 --> 24:02.199
I didn't know that.

24:04.001 --> 24:07.236
But you know, then the whole
Stephanie thing happened.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.837
No, I don't know.

24:09.839 --> 24:13.712
She even told me to not, uh, pursue Stephanie,
saying I was going to ruin everything.

24:15.012 --> 24:17.280
Yeah, but you did...
you did it anyway.

24:17.282 --> 24:19.348
- Jeb, I know you think I'm this loser.
- Mm-hmm.

24:19.350 --> 24:21.283
But the real question is,

24:21.285 --> 24:23.953
why was Carrie so upset that I
was pursuing Steph and not her?

24:23.955 --> 24:25.622
I don't know,

24:25.624 --> 24:28.692
maybe it's because she knew
Steph was a trainwreck.

24:28.694 --> 24:30.026
She was trying to protect
you from that.

24:30.028 --> 24:32.194
Because that's what
good friends do.

24:32.196 --> 24:35.733
Oh, thanks, you know, friends don't
let friends pursue true happiness.

24:35.735 --> 24:39.669
No, you see, I was thinking, friends don't
let friends pursue bad relationships

24:39.671 --> 24:41.371
that ultimately
lead to murder.

24:41.373 --> 24:42.740
Or maybe you
missed that class.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.875
Why are you here, Jeb?

24:44.877 --> 24:50.013
I'm not gonna let Carrie run around in
the desert by herself with Stephanie.

24:50.015 --> 24:53.553
You know, uh, the two of 'em
are more alike than you think.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.687
Carrie is nothing
like that sociopath.

24:57.689 --> 24:59.925
Oh, yes, she is.

24:59.927 --> 25:03.095
They are really close friends
and they rub off on each other.

25:03.097 --> 25:06.063
I would be careful.

25:06.065 --> 25:08.937
- Be careful?
- Yup, careful.

25:10.704 --> 25:13.007
Yeah, well you fuckers
deserve one another.

25:14.841 --> 25:17.309
Okay, I'm gonna get
us out of here,

25:17.311 --> 25:20.177
and you're right,

25:20.179 --> 25:23.349
this... this is a chance
for a fresh start.

25:23.351 --> 25:27.186
So, I was thinking,

25:27.188 --> 25:29.988
remember in high school when
we'd have all those sleepovers

25:29.990 --> 25:32.225
and they were really fun?

25:32.227 --> 25:36.896
I was thinking that we should
move in together.

25:36.898 --> 25:40.399
Like, we always talked about making
it happen but we never made it happen

25:40.401 --> 25:42.968
and now this could be our
chance.

25:42.970 --> 25:46.907
We could go out to clubs and have
parties, and late night movies.

25:46.909 --> 25:49.043
It would be so much fun.

25:49.045 --> 25:50.777
Steph, I can't.

25:50.779 --> 25:53.680
You can't?
Why because of that asshole Jeb?

25:53.682 --> 25:55.682
Don't say that,
he's my boyfriend.

25:55.684 --> 25:59.018
You depend way too much on him.
He is a guy.

25:59.020 --> 26:02.289
He will either hurt you,
or leave you, or both.

26:02.291 --> 26:06.694
I am here to protect you from
those assholes,

26:06.696 --> 26:08.928
one day he's gonna be gone,

26:08.930 --> 26:10.798
and then you will be
left with just me,

26:10.800 --> 26:13.200
so you might as well
get used to it now.

26:13.202 --> 26:17.774
Because I am the only one who is there to pick
up the pieces when your life falls apart.

26:20.844 --> 26:22.779
I know.

26:28.184 --> 26:33.822
Steph, uh, I, um, I...

26:33.824 --> 26:36.893
Oh, my god, spit it out.
You know that drives me crazy.

26:38.462 --> 26:42.931
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry Chad hurt you.

26:42.933 --> 26:46.437
Oh. Thanks.

26:48.972 --> 26:51.940
I never understood why
you were with him.

26:51.942 --> 26:54.209
He never treated you right.

26:54.211 --> 26:57.848
I saw the marks no matter how
hard you tried to cover them up.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.987
And the rumors that he was seeing
other girls and he just...

27:03.989 --> 27:06.759
He made you so unhappy.

27:08.126 --> 27:11.060
I always thought that you
deserved better.

27:11.062 --> 27:14.331
Dave, he loves you.

27:14.333 --> 27:18.367
I mean, he would do
anything for you.

27:18.369 --> 27:24.176
And then there are days that...
you treat him so bad.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.378
As bad as Chad treated you.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.782
I mean, why?

27:30.884 --> 27:33.453
I don't... I don't get it.

27:36.455 --> 27:40.059
Sometimes people do things that
don't make sense.

27:42.427 --> 27:46.964
Okay, Dave is good.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.937
He's funny and he's caring,

27:51.237 --> 27:55.240
and he would do whatever
I say with a smile.

27:56.944 --> 28:00.945
Um, I love him,

28:00.947 --> 28:02.948
I do.

28:02.950 --> 28:06.020
But I will destroy him.

28:07.387 --> 28:09.389
That's not true.

28:10.425 --> 28:13.059
I deserved Chad.

28:13.061 --> 28:15.595
Can I ask you a question?

28:15.597 --> 28:17.066
Sure.

28:20.869 --> 28:23.105
How did you kill him?

28:24.138 --> 28:25.305
I strangled him.

28:25.307 --> 28:27.206
Uh, no, I mean...

28:27.208 --> 28:31.980
I know physically, like, how you
killed him, I mean, um...

28:34.550 --> 28:40.454
What does it feel like
to take a life?

28:40.456 --> 28:42.058
Was it hard?

28:44.092 --> 28:47.027
Power.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.933
There is nothing like it.

28:51.066 --> 28:55.137
In that moment I felt...
powerful.

28:58.107 --> 29:02.112
So much anger built up.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.583
I was unstoppable.

29:07.918 --> 29:09.484
You know, it sounds weird,

29:09.486 --> 29:14.488
but I hope you get to experience
that for yourself one day.

29:14.490 --> 29:16.092
Me? I...

29:17.427 --> 29:21.032
I don't think I could.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.301
Oh, you can do it, Carrie.

29:25.303 --> 29:29.408
I mean, you are stronger
than you think you are.

30:16.623 --> 30:21.124
I even felt a little
bit guilty, but...

30:21.126 --> 30:24.362
every regretful thought
that I have

30:24.364 --> 30:30.200
about killing that piece
of shit goes away

30:30.202 --> 30:35.673
because I know I did what I needed
to do in that moment to survive.

30:35.675 --> 30:38.346
And I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

30:52.259 --> 30:55.195
You think something's
out there?

31:12.013 --> 31:13.046
Hey, hey, what happened?

31:13.048 --> 31:14.646
Uh.

31:14.648 --> 31:16.281
Oh, geez.

31:16.283 --> 31:17.283
Are you okay?

31:17.285 --> 31:19.052
It's just a little prick.

31:19.054 --> 31:21.720
Yeah, I'll say it is.
Get the hell out of my hand.

31:21.722 --> 31:24.057
I'm sorry.

31:24.059 --> 31:27.161
It's Joshua tree, it's just a piece of cactus.

31:27.163 --> 31:28.628
You're fine.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.530
Great, okay, break's over.

31:30.532 --> 31:33.971
The sooner we get out of this
man-eating desert the better.

31:37.306 --> 31:41.375
Dave, you should have
printed out a memo.

31:41.377 --> 31:45.578
Yeah, next murder, I expect a full
breakdown of indigenous species,

31:45.580 --> 31:49.317
plant life, oh, and, um,
restaurants.

31:49.319 --> 31:52.386
Please, that would be
awesome next time.

31:52.388 --> 31:55.092
I hope there's not a next time.

32:21.086 --> 32:22.087
Yep.

32:24.555 --> 32:26.557
Do you hear that?

32:28.359 --> 32:30.225
Hello?

32:30.227 --> 32:32.662
There's a footstep...
there's a footstep out there.

32:32.664 --> 32:33.863
Okay, there's something
out there!

32:33.865 --> 32:34.764
I swear to God.

32:34.766 --> 32:36.699
Did you not hear that?

32:36.701 --> 32:39.602
Keep your cool, come on, just got
a little bit more ways to go.

32:39.604 --> 32:43.107
Shut up,
there's someone there.

32:43.109 --> 32:44.444
What the fuck?

32:45.477 --> 32:47.479
- What?
- What?

32:58.859 --> 33:03.128
What the fuck?
What the fuck happened?

33:03.130 --> 33:04.532
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

33:09.870 --> 33:11.505
Oh, fuck.

33:12.538 --> 33:14.839
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:14.841 --> 33:16.340
Oh, my God.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.142
What the fuck happened?

33:18.144 --> 33:20.777
No! Hey, hey! Shh! Don't fucking
do that shit, come on.

33:20.779 --> 33:22.915
- I knew this would happen.
- No.

33:22.917 --> 33:26.752
- I got you, okay.
- Jeb, how is this... how is this possible?

33:26.754 --> 33:31.590
We're back where we started, how
is that even happening? I don't...

33:31.592 --> 33:33.425
Hey, it's all right.

33:33.427 --> 33:36.762
Just stay here, okay?

33:36.764 --> 33:38.796
Everything's gonna be fine,
all right?

33:38.798 --> 33:40.466
Hey, everything's gonna be okay,

33:40.468 --> 33:42.668
all right? Hold this.

33:42.670 --> 33:44.837
This is all your fucking fault.

33:44.839 --> 33:46.672
How is this my fault,
Stephanie?

33:46.674 --> 33:49.708
We all went together like
it was your plan.

33:49.710 --> 33:50.877
- Okay?
- Fucking retarded.

33:50.879 --> 33:52.946
Everything's fine,
everyone's okay.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.415
- What if I had fucking been here?
- How is this my...

33:55.417 --> 33:57.684
What do you think would have
happened to me if you left me here?

33:57.686 --> 33:59.686
- Okay, good...
- Or Carrie and Jeb,

33:59.688 --> 34:01.554
what do you think
would have happened to them?

34:01.556 --> 34:03.758
- How is this my fault?
- Are you kidding me?

34:09.297 --> 34:11.665
I'm just helping you out,
Stephanie.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.833
Yeah, a lot you've done.

34:13.835 --> 34:17.471
The car's dead. This is
amazing, you've helped so much,

34:17.473 --> 34:22.643
I'm so happy that you're here
right now.

34:24.346 --> 34:26.614
Everything's fine.
Everyone's okay.

34:26.616 --> 34:29.583
Nobody's okay, we're in the middle
of nowhere with a dead fucking car!

34:35.693 --> 34:36.891
I haven't seen one
of these in forever.

34:36.893 --> 34:40.460
That is not mine.

34:40.463 --> 34:43.634
Why is that here?

34:48.239 --> 34:50.340
Let's see what's
on this bad boy.

34:57.948 --> 35:01.486
Guys, that's us.

35:02.519 --> 35:04.889
What the fuck?

35:08.593 --> 35:10.692
Someone's been fucking
watching us.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.597
I can't, I can't.

35:20.939 --> 35:23.609
Every single one of us.

35:25.344 --> 35:26.378
Our faces.

35:31.717 --> 35:33.016
Fucking shit.

35:33.018 --> 35:34.221
Carrie.

35:37.355 --> 35:39.225
Oh, no.

35:40.025 --> 35:42.228
Oh, fuck.

35:43.795 --> 35:46.799
What the fuck is he, man?

35:50.671 --> 35:53.006
Oh, fuck, dude.

35:56.876 --> 35:58.878
Fuck.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.735
We shouldn't have come here.

36:22.737 --> 36:26.339
Because of the Joshua tree.

36:26.341 --> 36:30.076
What about the Joshua tree?

36:30.078 --> 36:32.712
It only grows in two places,

36:32.714 --> 36:35.048
two places in the whole world.

36:35.050 --> 36:39.785
Jerusalem, which is
the gateway to Heaven,

36:39.787 --> 36:43.090
and here,

36:43.092 --> 36:46.762
which is the
gateway to Hell.

36:48.063 --> 36:51.365
And I think that
we're being punished

36:51.367 --> 36:53.466
because we did something
terrible

36:53.468 --> 36:55.570
and that's why we're here.

36:56.972 --> 37:00.310
And I think that we're
not gonna make it.

37:05.047 --> 37:07.114
We don't
deserve to keep going,

37:07.116 --> 37:10.851
because we brought him here.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.390
And we're all going to Hell.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.535
It's over.

37:29.974 --> 37:32.410
We're all gonna die.

37:37.648 --> 37:39.651
We're gonna die.

37:42.452 --> 37:47.690
This is bullshit, this has
nothing to do with a tree.

37:47.692 --> 37:48.694
No.

37:53.765 --> 37:56.632
It doesn't matter.

37:56.634 --> 37:59.536
There are two options,

37:59.538 --> 38:01.471
either he's out there,

38:01.473 --> 38:03.172
heading towards the road,

38:03.174 --> 38:05.942
licking his wounds,

38:05.944 --> 38:08.581
just swearing off
crazy bitches forever,

38:11.050 --> 38:15.186
or he's here,

38:15.188 --> 38:18.688
just plotting his revenge.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.460
For what Stephanie
did to him.

38:23.195 --> 38:25.829
Then it's settled,

38:25.831 --> 38:27.664
we leave him here to rot.

39:18.920 --> 39:19.885
Over there.

39:19.887 --> 39:21.052
Are you sure?

39:21.054 --> 39:23.058
Of course I'm sure.

39:35.838 --> 39:37.270
- Come out you motherfu...
- Stephanie, stop.

39:37.272 --> 39:39.573
I don't think you're
getting this,

39:39.575 --> 39:41.908
I'm not just gonna sit here and wait
for some asshole to toy with me.

39:41.910 --> 39:46.014
If he wants a fight he can come
out here and I will give him one.

39:50.554 --> 39:53.087
Can we just calm down?

39:53.089 --> 39:55.590
It's probably just an animal.

39:55.592 --> 39:56.627
You think?

39:58.261 --> 40:00.328
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't sound
like it's coming for us.

40:00.330 --> 40:01.795
Does it?

40:01.797 --> 40:03.566
Well, yeah,
it's like a squirrel.

40:04.567 --> 40:06.569
Yeah.

40:21.084 --> 40:23.318
Okay, well,
nothing has changed.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.256
We still need to get
to the main road and...

40:27.258 --> 40:30.695
Wait, where's the camera?

40:36.634 --> 40:38.735
You left a camera

40:38.737 --> 40:42.072
showing all of us
bury a dead body

40:42.074 --> 40:45.308
in the front seat
of your truck!

40:45.310 --> 40:48.648
What the hell?

40:50.616 --> 40:52.281
Okay.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.719
We all know how important
that camera is, right?

40:55.721 --> 40:59.190
So you know what
you need to do.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.927
Is anyone gonna come with me?

41:02.929 --> 41:04.128
Oh, no, no.

41:04.130 --> 41:06.731
We all know that you
fucked this up,

41:06.733 --> 41:08.898
so you need to fix it.

41:08.900 --> 41:13.003
We will wait right here.

41:13.005 --> 41:16.273
We'll be right here, Dave.
It's not that far.

41:16.275 --> 41:19.343
I'm pretty sure you can get
there and back in 20 minutes.

41:19.345 --> 41:23.348
All right, fine, but you
have to hold my jacket.

41:23.350 --> 41:27.355
So I can do it,
just like I do everything else.

41:46.974 --> 41:49.941
How far do you think it is
to the road?

41:49.943 --> 41:51.309
No idea.

41:51.311 --> 41:53.746
Wait, Jeb has no idea
about something?

41:53.748 --> 41:56.182
I never thought that
would happen.

41:56.184 --> 41:58.918
Okay, you manipulative bitch,

41:58.920 --> 42:01.220
you just sent Dave out alone,

42:01.222 --> 42:03.155
because you were too lazy
to do it yourself.

42:03.157 --> 42:05.825
It has nothing to do
with being too lazy.

42:05.827 --> 42:10.698
I'm sorry. It has everything to do with your
sick and twisted need to control someone,

42:10.700 --> 42:13.734
which in this moment,
you needed stroked.

42:13.736 --> 42:15.401
So you thought,
"I have an idea,

42:15.403 --> 42:19.073
I'll send Dave out into the
darkness alone for my pleasure."

42:19.075 --> 42:20.940
You know, you're a whole
different kind of monster...

42:20.942 --> 42:24.712
Okay, I'm going to tell you
something right now, I hate you.

42:24.714 --> 42:26.747
You think you're so much
better than everyone else,

42:26.749 --> 42:28.848
and you flaunt it around
the rest of us.

42:28.850 --> 42:32.719
I can't wait until Carrie wakes
up and sees you for what you are.

42:32.721 --> 42:34.222
And what is that?

42:34.224 --> 42:37.891
A spineless loser by day
and sick pervert by night.

42:37.893 --> 42:41.396
The only reason we are in
this hell right now is

42:41.398 --> 42:43.334
because you thought a break up
was just a little too cliché.

42:46.068 --> 42:49.804
I will take being a spineless
loser over being a soulless cunt.

42:49.806 --> 42:50.808
Jeb!

42:51.808 --> 42:53.074
You suck, you know that?

42:53.076 --> 42:56.681
She's going to use you
all the time.

42:59.850 --> 43:02.250
Yeah, I think I left that open,
right?

43:02.252 --> 43:05.189
Yeah, that's how I left it.

43:07.524 --> 43:10.292
Okay, um....

43:10.294 --> 43:12.030
Just need the camera,

43:13.830 --> 43:17.468
and head back
and everything will be fine.

43:19.269 --> 43:21.272
Okay.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.798
Oh, fuck.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.468
Of course it's not here. Of
course, that's what happens.

44:06.553 --> 44:09.220
I brought my gat with me.

44:09.222 --> 44:11.956
It holds twelve bullets.

44:11.958 --> 44:13.458
Bullets are expensive these days

44:13.460 --> 44:17.061
but not... not like I'm
planning on not using them.

44:17.063 --> 44:19.531
I got this awesome, uh,

44:19.533 --> 44:23.869
apache ax thing,

44:23.871 --> 44:26.070
that I used on the last
motherfuckers that messed with us!

44:32.580 --> 44:35.148
Run! It's coming!

44:35.150 --> 44:37.316
Run!

44:37.318 --> 44:38.885
It's coming!

44:38.887 --> 44:40.385
Just sort of waiting
for him to come back.

44:40.387 --> 44:41.954
I don't even know if
he's gonna come back.

44:41.956 --> 44:43.155
Are you a psychiatrist?
Do you have a degree?

44:43.157 --> 44:44.990
- Yeah, I'm a psychiatrist.
- What do you have a degree in?

44:44.992 --> 44:46.526
Yes, I have a PhD in fuck you.

44:46.528 --> 44:51.430
Run! Run!

45:04.513 --> 45:07.080
I think we're okay.

45:07.082 --> 45:08.582
No. Jeb! No!

45:08.584 --> 45:11.888
Yes, Carrie, we have to go.

45:16.491 --> 45:21.296
Look, Carrie, I'm sorry,

45:21.298 --> 45:22.664
she was gonna hurt you,

45:22.666 --> 45:24.965
and I'm not gonna
let that happen.

45:24.967 --> 45:27.401
She's a monster and I'm
gonna protect you from that.

45:27.403 --> 45:28.936
All right?

45:28.938 --> 45:30.604
Everything I'm doing,
from here on,

45:30.606 --> 45:33.110
is just for you,
for us.

45:42.052 --> 45:43.284
I'm sorry.

45:43.286 --> 45:45.922
All right?

45:45.924 --> 45:49.225
And look,
she murdered someone.

45:49.227 --> 45:52.227
Carrie, she invited him into her
house and she murdered him...

45:52.229 --> 45:54.562
No, she was defending herself.

45:54.564 --> 45:56.165
Is that what she told you?

45:56.167 --> 45:59.004
That she was defending herself?

46:00.471 --> 46:04.540
Then I guess, uh, he was
attacking her with his back,

46:04.542 --> 46:07.576
because she murdered him
from behind, Carrie.

46:07.578 --> 46:11.149
That makes self-defense very
difficult to prove.

46:13.251 --> 46:16.219
No.

46:16.221 --> 46:18.224
You sound just like her.

46:21.025 --> 46:23.293
Come on,

46:23.295 --> 46:29.132
I did this for you because you
refuse to help yourself, all right?

46:29.134 --> 46:31.200
I love you,
I'm the one that loves you.

46:31.202 --> 46:33.538
Do you not understand that?

46:34.540 --> 46:36.674
All right? I love you.

46:36.676 --> 46:40.111
But I'm getting us
the fuck out of here.

46:40.113 --> 46:41.279
Let's move.

46:45.318 --> 46:47.051
Hey, you okay?

46:47.053 --> 46:48.151
No.

46:48.153 --> 46:49.386
Why do you do that?

46:49.388 --> 46:50.455
Do what?

46:50.457 --> 46:52.256
You don't let me touch you.

46:52.258 --> 46:54.328
I just don't like being touched.

46:58.264 --> 46:59.530
You never give me a chance.

46:59.532 --> 47:01.699
What are you talking about?

47:01.701 --> 47:03.434
You know what I'm fucking
talking about.

47:03.436 --> 47:06.204
I've been here through
everything with you

47:06.206 --> 47:08.042
and you just treat me
like a house boy.

47:09.610 --> 47:11.378
I always thought of you
as my friend.

47:13.079 --> 47:15.347
I want more.

47:15.349 --> 47:18.384
Can't you just be okay
with what we have?

47:18.386 --> 47:21.152
No! I can't, Steph.

47:21.154 --> 47:23.622
I have to see you with
all these guys

47:23.624 --> 47:25.524
and I have to pretend
I'm okay with it.

47:25.526 --> 47:28.361
You rub it in my face
and I have to be cool?

47:28.363 --> 47:30.263
You think I wanted this?

47:30.265 --> 47:34.033
No girl wants a friend who's
constantly trying to screw her.

47:34.035 --> 47:35.801
It sucks.

47:35.803 --> 47:39.008
But you put yourself
in this position.

47:39.807 --> 47:41.774
I did this to myself, Steph?

47:41.776 --> 47:44.477
Are you... are you serious?

47:44.479 --> 47:46.246
Really?

47:46.248 --> 47:50.150
Did you ever think that maybe...

47:50.152 --> 47:53.154
I was trying to save you
from something worse?

47:53.156 --> 47:54.822
Like what?

47:54.824 --> 47:56.193
Like what?

47:59.295 --> 48:01.494
What are you doing here, Dave?

48:01.496 --> 48:04.632
I mean, this isn't
a camping trip.

48:04.634 --> 48:06.766
I screwed up.

48:06.768 --> 48:10.504
Don't you think that
that could have been you?

48:10.506 --> 48:11.439
I wish it was.

48:11.441 --> 48:13.108
You don't mean that.

48:13.110 --> 48:16.343
I have been here through
everything with you

48:16.345 --> 48:19.280
and this hurts so much.

48:19.282 --> 48:21.284
I'm sorry.

48:22.485 --> 48:24.586
It's not my fault.

48:24.588 --> 48:30.191
You need to understand that
nothing will ever happen bet...

48:32.695 --> 48:35.230
Fuck! My lip! Oh, fuck!

48:35.232 --> 48:36.531
Oh, you bitch.

48:36.533 --> 48:37.799
You didn't have to do that.

48:37.801 --> 48:38.868
Fuck!

48:38.870 --> 48:41.406
Ugh!

48:42.507 --> 48:43.572
Uh, you bit my lip...

48:43.574 --> 48:46.109
You didn't have to do that.

48:48.513 --> 48:49.745
Oh, my God!

48:49.747 --> 48:50.880
Ah!

48:50.882 --> 48:52.518
Dave!

49:06.164 --> 49:08.231
Where is he?

49:08.233 --> 49:10.200
- I don't know, something took him.
- What's happened to him?

49:10.202 --> 49:11.668
I don't know,
something took him!

49:11.670 --> 49:12.836
He tried to hurt me!

49:12.838 --> 49:13.836
Dave did?

49:13.838 --> 49:15.372
He tried to hurt me, Carrie.

49:15.374 --> 49:18.842
Something came out
and dragged him away.

49:18.844 --> 49:20.543
So you fucking killed him.

49:20.545 --> 49:22.446
No, I didn't.

49:22.448 --> 49:25.516
Something came out here
and dragged him away.

49:25.518 --> 49:26.683
So all this blood?

49:26.685 --> 49:28.919
That's just your blood,
right?

49:28.921 --> 49:31.288
'Cause it couldn't be Dave's blood
if something else took him.

49:31.290 --> 49:33.493
Screw you, Jeb,
I am telling the truth.

49:35.428 --> 49:36.497
Then where did he go?

49:38.797 --> 49:40.765
We're getting out of here.

49:40.767 --> 49:42.600
Yeah, that's the
best idea you've had all night.

49:42.602 --> 49:45.537
I don't think you're
understanding me.

49:45.539 --> 49:48.110
You're not coming with us.

49:50.177 --> 49:52.443
Really?

49:52.445 --> 49:54.813
That's how this is
gonna go down?

49:54.815 --> 50:00.322
Years of friendship
ruined over a boy.

50:01.789 --> 50:04.456
I'm sorry, Steph.

50:04.458 --> 50:08.394
You did this to yourself.

50:08.396 --> 50:11.698
No, don't you apologize to me.

50:11.700 --> 50:14.667
I've been trying to warn you
about him from the beginning.

50:14.669 --> 50:17.370
He is going to hurt you, Carrie.

50:17.372 --> 50:20.506
He might try to give off that
nice guys finish last routine

50:20.508 --> 50:23.478
but he is just as much
a monster as I am.

50:26.247 --> 50:30.584
I wasn't lying when
I said you should be careful.

50:30.586 --> 50:32.987
That is not true,
don't say that.

50:32.989 --> 50:36.456
She's not falling for it
anymore, Stephanie.

50:36.458 --> 50:38.529
You're on your own.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.764
Like it, Steph.

50:50.540 --> 50:54.411
You're just as bad as she is!

50:56.846 --> 50:58.549
Carrie!

51:35.920 --> 51:42.261
Your kind,
and now you're all the same.

51:55.907 --> 51:58.344
Do it.

52:00.412 --> 52:03.449
Please, I don't want to.

52:07.986 --> 52:12.857
Please,
I don't want to.

52:28.542 --> 52:30.975
Do it!

52:30.977 --> 52:34.546
Do it or I will!

52:34.548 --> 52:38.383
I just wanted her to love me.

52:38.385 --> 52:42.354
I just wanted her
to love me.

52:42.356 --> 52:44.523
Do it!

52:44.525 --> 52:47.528
I just wanted her
to love me!

52:50.597 --> 52:52.601
I just wanted her
to love me!

52:53.735 --> 52:57.072
I just wanted
her to love me!

53:10.685 --> 53:12.689
Love me.

53:49.192 --> 53:53.631
Whoever you are,
I hope you're happy.

53:54.631 --> 53:56.633
Because you ruined my life.

53:57.635 --> 53:59.636
Now what have you seen?

54:50.789 --> 54:56.028
You caused me so much pain.

54:58.998 --> 55:01.002
Look what you did to me!

55:02.134 --> 55:03.970
Look at me!

57:11.403 --> 57:15.005
Please, sit down, Carrie.

57:15.007 --> 57:20.745
I'm not really
happy right now.

57:20.747 --> 57:25.049
I'm sad.

57:25.051 --> 57:29.890
Tell me about your friend Dave.
What's he like?

57:31.089 --> 57:33.890
- Again?
- Shut up, Carrie.

57:33.892 --> 57:35.725
Do you like your friends?

57:35.727 --> 57:37.995
Yeah.

57:37.997 --> 57:40.031
Why are you even talking
to this idiot?

57:40.033 --> 57:43.734
You want to tell me about Dave?

57:43.736 --> 57:48.173
Dave...

57:48.175 --> 57:51.409
nice.

57:51.411 --> 57:55.213
He's in love with Stephanie.

57:55.215 --> 57:57.382
Well, what about Stephanie?

57:57.384 --> 57:59.851
Is she nice to you?

57:59.853 --> 58:01.856
Stop talking.

58:04.925 --> 58:08.393
Stephanie can be nice.

58:08.395 --> 58:13.198
She doesn't really
like to be.

58:13.200 --> 58:17.305
She thinks that people take
advantage of girls who are nice.

58:18.707 --> 58:21.176
Does Stephanie like Jeb?

58:22.843 --> 58:25.410
I wish she did.

58:25.412 --> 58:28.147
God, you're gonna
ruin everything.

58:28.149 --> 58:29.716
She hates Jeb.

58:29.718 --> 58:31.350
They're gonna lock us up

58:31.352 --> 58:32.920
and they know what we did.

58:32.922 --> 58:34.487
They know we're responsible.

58:34.489 --> 58:39.726
...because I like him.

58:39.728 --> 58:43.831
Do you think that
Stephanie would ever hurt Jeb?

58:43.833 --> 58:46.836
I hope not.

58:49.438 --> 58:50.938
I should go...

58:50.940 --> 58:53.440
I... I... I need to...
I need to go.

58:53.442 --> 58:55.375
Do you think that
Stephanie would hurt you?

58:55.377 --> 58:58.213
No! I... She's my friend,

58:58.215 --> 59:01.218
she wouldn't do that.

59:03.820 --> 59:05.285
But could she hurt you?

59:05.287 --> 59:08.388
Carrie,
you stupid fucking bitch!

59:08.390 --> 59:10.524
If you say anything,
I swear to God...

59:10.526 --> 59:12.729
She's my friend.

59:16.166 --> 59:19.704
All friends can hurt you
if they really wanted to.

59:24.275 --> 59:28.210
You were my only friend.

59:28.212 --> 59:31.216
Now you're just like
everybody else.

59:34.252 --> 59:38.087
Carrie,
I'm gonna find you.

59:38.089 --> 59:39.822
I'm gonna find you

59:39.824 --> 59:44.226
and I'm gonna make you hurt
for what you did to me.

59:44.228 --> 59:48.231
I'm gonna make you bleed.

59:48.233 --> 59:54.073
I'm gonna find you.

01:00:43.289 --> 01:00:45.459
Is that you Dave?

01:00:49.362 --> 01:00:51.865
Who is that?
Who's there?

01:00:57.171 --> 01:00:59.906
Who is that?

01:00:59.908 --> 01:01:01.607
It's okay.

01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:04.611
Don't be afraid.

01:01:04.613 --> 01:01:07.482
Oh, my God.

01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:12.484
We thought you were dead.

01:01:12.486 --> 01:01:17.091
I don't know what I am.

01:01:23.532 --> 01:01:25.999
We did this to you?

01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:28.568
No.

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:32.273
I tried to leave her,

01:01:32.275 --> 01:01:36.546
she's so much worse
than I realized.

01:01:37.646 --> 01:01:41.481
I am so sorry, Chad.

01:01:41.483 --> 01:01:46.087
You... have to stop her.

01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:47.689
I can't, she's...

01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:49.894
She's a killer.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.930
Hey.

01:01:54.932 --> 01:01:56.665
It's okay.

01:01:56.667 --> 01:01:58.600
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:58.602 --> 01:02:03.671
She's only strong when
you follow her.

01:02:03.673 --> 01:02:06.877
She needs you to follow her.

01:02:10.213 --> 01:02:12.217
It's gonna be okay,
okay?

01:02:13.351 --> 01:02:15.951
It'll be okay.

01:02:15.953 --> 01:02:19.989
I promise.

01:02:19.991 --> 01:02:25.193
Friendship is the truest bond.

01:02:25.195 --> 01:02:27.596
A spear against my friend is a dagger in your spine.

01:02:27.598 --> 01:02:30.498
A spear against my friend is
a dagger in your spine.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.636
A spear against my friend
is a dagger in your spine.

01:02:33.638 --> 01:02:37.107
A spear against my friend is
a dagger in your spine.

01:02:58.732 --> 01:03:00.697
I never thought
you'd have it in you.

01:03:00.699 --> 01:03:03.937
- Steph?
- That was fantastic.

01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:07.438
I'd like to think
I played a little part in that,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.311
I mean, I have been
nurturing you for yours.

01:03:11.511 --> 01:03:14.145
He hurt you, didn't he?

01:03:14.147 --> 01:03:18.282
Yeah, he did, but he was mine
to hurt back and now he's gone.

01:03:18.284 --> 01:03:21.519
No, I...
I did this for you.

01:03:21.521 --> 01:03:24.522
Oh, I know you did,
sweetie,

01:03:24.524 --> 01:03:27.292
and I couldn't be
more proud.

01:03:27.294 --> 01:03:30.298
So what do we do now?

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:34.733
Whatever we want.

01:03:34.735 --> 01:03:37.202
I mean, you proved
yourself tonight.

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:40.071
You proved that you can do way
more than I gave you credit for.

01:03:40.073 --> 01:03:42.441
Well, Steph,

01:03:42.443 --> 01:03:44.743
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

Why? Why? Why?

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:20.435
No one can survive losing
this much blood.

01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:02.310
What's Dave like?

01:09:04.077 --> 01:09:05.977
Tell me about your friend.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:07.982
Could she hurt you?

01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:25.499
Could she hurt you?

01:09:25.501 --> 01:09:27.000
No.

01:09:27.002 --> 01:09:30.006
I... She's my friend,
she wouldn't do that.

01:09:53.095 --> 01:09:55.899
Wait!

01:09:57.033 --> 01:09:59.666
They're all dead.

01:09:59.668 --> 01:10:02.002
Dave, Carrie.

01:10:02.004 --> 01:10:03.539
Well, we're alive.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.476
And you think we're going
to make it out of this?

01:10:08.478 --> 01:10:14.049
Everything that happened
here is because of you!

01:10:14.051 --> 01:10:16.685
You dragged us into this

01:10:16.687 --> 01:10:18.987
and you're going
to die here,

01:10:18.989 --> 01:10:22.791
with us.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.037
Wake up.

01:13:46.039 --> 01:13:48.338
Wake up.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.707
Wake up.

01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:54.045
Wake up.

01:13:54.047 --> 01:13:57.881
Wake up.
Wake up.

01:13:57.883 --> 01:14:00.117
Wake up.

01:14:00.119 --> 01:14:02.286
Wake up.

01:14:02.288 --> 01:14:04.822
All right, good.

01:14:04.824 --> 01:14:06.823
You're okay.
You're safe.

01:14:06.825 --> 01:14:10.630
You're safe, it's okay.

01:14:11.432 --> 01:14:13.431
It's remarkable.

01:14:13.433 --> 01:14:16.967
From the last hour's
experiments, it's clear,

01:14:16.969 --> 01:14:22.473
that Miss Thompson has completely broken
free from any psychological barriers,

01:14:22.475 --> 01:14:26.378
that hold acute
personalities independent.

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:30.481
What we've accomplished
here is the first steps

01:14:30.483 --> 01:14:38.925
in finding a psychological cure for
the most aggressive mental illnesses.

01:14:55.309 --> 01:14:58.246
It looks like you've
made it back.

01:15:04.854 --> 01:15:08.354
Do you think the
process worked, Doctor?

01:15:08.356 --> 01:15:10.793
There's no doubt in
my mind it worked.

01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:18.034
But it's too early to tell
what benefit it's had on her.

01:15:22.972 --> 01:15:25.806
Carrie,

01:15:25.808 --> 01:15:30.246
I know it's gonna take you
some time to process this.

01:15:31.882 --> 01:15:37.085
And it's not gonna be easy,
but I assure you,

01:15:37.087 --> 01:15:41.555
that it will get easier
when you see...

01:15:41.557 --> 01:15:45.194
Chad, and Dave, and Jeb,

01:15:45.196 --> 01:15:48.433
and Stephanie
for what they are.

01:15:52.536 --> 01:15:57.208
I understand this is
not gonna be easy.

01:15:59.076 --> 01:16:03.148
You've lived with these
people for some time.

01:16:05.116 --> 01:16:07.315
But it's time.

01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:11.856
It's time to break free.

01:16:15.359 --> 01:16:17.263
What would you like me to
put in the report, Doctor?

01:16:19.031 --> 01:16:20.032
Yes.

01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:27.469
As of today,

01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:32.509
I believe we've successfully
eradicated half the personalities

01:16:32.511 --> 01:16:34.914
that Carrie had created.

01:16:37.449 --> 01:16:41.384
At this moment we can't
tell whether,

01:16:41.386 --> 01:16:44.390
they're lying dormant,
or gone completely.

01:16:47.126 --> 01:16:51.027
My professional opinion would be
that she was able to

01:16:51.029 --> 01:16:56.535
break down the less
aggressive personalities.

01:16:56.537 --> 01:17:04.209
Furthermore, the personality
that calls herself Stephanie,

01:17:04.211 --> 01:17:07.312
was able to remain.

01:17:07.314 --> 01:17:10.248
I feel that a strong
anti-psychotic

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.085
and sedative regiment

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:18.055
should reduce the chances
of that personality becoming...

01:17:18.057 --> 01:17:19.394
violent.

01:17:20.395 --> 01:17:24.296
Is there anything else?

01:17:24.298 --> 01:17:28.902
I believe we must continue
this course of action.

01:17:28.904 --> 01:17:32.271
If there's any chance
of Miss Thompson

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:36.509
ever leaving this institution,

01:17:36.511 --> 01:17:41.584
but I believe she has it
in her to succeed.

01:17:44.987 --> 01:17:47.624
What... happened?

01:17:49.224 --> 01:17:52.228
Where am I?

01:18:02.103 --> 01:18:07.207
I hope you can hear me,
Stephanie.

01:18:07.209 --> 01:18:11.646
The next time Carrie comes
to me for treatment,

01:18:11.648 --> 01:18:14.581
I'm going to rip you
out of her

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:18.421
like the cancer you are.

01:18:22.425 --> 01:18:26.160
I know you can hear me,
Stephanie.

01:18:26.162 --> 01:18:28.064
Say something.

01:18:32.136 --> 01:18:34.373
And there was silence.

01:18:43.081 --> 01:18:44.416
Is that her tongue?

01:18:49.119 --> 01:18:51.323
Get a nurse!
Get the nurse!

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.242
I am the only one who
is there to pick up the pieces

01:19:12.244 --> 01:19:14.013
when your life falls apart.
