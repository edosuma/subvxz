<i>Renacimiento... renacimiento.</i>

01:13.490 --> 01:15.323
We're clear.

01:24.690 --> 01:27.324
<i>Renacimiento...</i>

01:34.390 --> 01:36.355
That's all he's been saying.

01:36.357 --> 01:39.658
It means rebirth.

01:44.822 --> 01:49.624
<i>Renacimiento renacimiento.</i>

01:51.889 --> 01:54.990
Rebirth of what?

01:57.757 --> 02:00.256
<i>Renacimiento...</i>

02:03.856 --> 02:07.289
You said he was blind.

02:07.291 --> 02:10.821
Yes... he was.

02:10.823 --> 02:14.191
Can you show me where it landed?

02:41.556 --> 02:44.057
We're too late.

02:56.256 --> 02:59.156
<i>This place is changing.</i>

03:01.390 --> 03:03.488
<i>Everyone in town's nervous...</i>

03:03.490 --> 03:08.791
<i>but, like you say, nothing
bad ever lasts, right?</i>

03:13.323 --> 03:15.889
Annie's coming to visit.

03:19.190 --> 03:23.189
I was hoping we could take a road trip.

03:23.191 --> 03:27.620
You'd be so proud of her, you know.

03:27.622 --> 03:30.790
So proud.

03:35.857 --> 03:39.655
<i>Headlining news this morning,
protests continue around...</i>

03:39.657 --> 03:43.420
<i>the nation following approval
of the President's draft bill...</i>

03:43.422 --> 03:48.221
<i>pledging over 100,000 additional
troops to Operation Terminus...</i>

03:48.223 --> 03:51.488
<i>the ongoing occupation of Iran.</i>

03:51.490 --> 03:54.855
<i>Russian and Chinese Foreign Ministers
have intensified warnings...</i>

03:54.857 --> 03:59.924
<i>against the United States as
the President maintains resolve.</i>

04:01.489 --> 04:04.421
Last week it was braces.
Yesterday, Ritalin.

04:04.423 --> 04:06.320
Trading stocks, man, that's my game.

04:06.322 --> 04:08.288
You assholes gonna do any work today?

04:08.290 --> 04:11.221
Oh, yeah, we're
over-friggin-whelmed here.

04:11.223 --> 04:17.255
Hey. J.C.'s Trans-Am needs
a transmission overhaul.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.488
New exhaust... nitrogen in the tires.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.654
- It's a long shot.
- Yeah.

04:21.656 --> 04:25.354
Three days to order the parts.
Two days bank shuts us down.

04:25.356 --> 04:28.721
22 years I've been helping
this town run on wheels.

04:28.723 --> 04:33.188
- Doesn't have to end like this, Ned.
- You kidding me?

04:33.190 --> 04:37.421
I'll be paying this shit-storm off for the
next 22 years, if I don't file Chapter 7 now.

04:37.423 --> 04:39.655
We ain't asking for a handout.

04:39.657 --> 04:43.654
Boys'll put in the work, you know
that, but fuck, Ned, we need our jobs.

04:43.656 --> 04:48.123
David, it's over. Done.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.487
Well, I'll see if Ramon's
got any exhausts lying around.

04:53.489 --> 05:00.721
Fix J.C.'s Trans-Am, maybe that keeps
the doors open another couple days.

05:00.723 --> 05:03.757
Yeah. Do what you want.

05:16.690 --> 05:19.024
She's something.

05:20.856 --> 05:24.353
Yeah, she's a crying shame.

05:24.355 --> 05:26.288
You the boss around here?

05:26.290 --> 05:30.354
If you're looking for a job,
you're in the wrong place.

05:30.356 --> 05:32.957
Tony, let's go.

05:36.389 --> 05:39.287
I did three years as a field
engineer with the ninth.

05:39.289 --> 05:41.024
Yep.

05:42.255 --> 05:43.788
I just need a chance.

05:43.790 --> 05:46.691
We all do.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.922
<i>General Corazon estimates
casualty rates to drop...</i>

05:58.924 --> 06:02.091
<i>once draft reinforcements
complete training.</i>

06:05.657 --> 06:08.955
Jesus, Dad!

06:08.957 --> 06:10.588
I'm cutting you off. Just go home.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.688
No...

06:11.690 --> 06:14.488
Come on, Mickey.

06:14.490 --> 06:17.823
- You can ride with me. Come on.
- No.

06:20.957 --> 06:22.890
Come on.

06:25.957 --> 06:27.787
You too, Mr. Chamberlain.

06:27.789 --> 06:31.353
Come on. Last one.

06:31.355 --> 06:34.720
<i>As you can see, the
occupation relies...</i>

06:34.722 --> 06:38.187
<i>on strategic strong-holds along
the Afghan-Iranian border.</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:42.820
<i>A swathe of Russian-endorsed guerilla
fighters continued across the Hindu Kush...</i>

06:42.822 --> 06:46.823
<i>from Pakistan to conduct
raids on US bases.</i>

06:49.390 --> 06:52.287
H2O... on the rocks.

06:52.289 --> 06:55.823
Hey. Bourbon, double.

06:59.423 --> 07:02.253
<i>The daily casualty
rate has risen to 23.</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:04.654
So when'd the U.S. Army become
target practice for Arabs...

07:04.656 --> 07:06.755
and cannon fodder for Jews?

07:06.757 --> 07:09.387
Should send me over. I'll
teach 'em how to fight.

07:09.389 --> 07:12.320
Bunch of goddamned pussies.
Used to have standards.

07:12.322 --> 07:15.453
Now they'll take anyone.
Queers, Mexicans. Mexican queers.

07:15.455 --> 07:17.887
No wonder we're losing.

07:17.889 --> 07:22.290
What the fuck would you know about it? Huh?

07:29.323 --> 07:31.890
You should sign up. They'd love you.

07:35.490 --> 07:42.888
Okay, princess... let's go.

07:42.890 --> 07:46.257
- Goddamn Tyson.
- Here we go again.

07:49.255 --> 07:50.820
Hey!

07:50.822 --> 07:54.290
Come on, guys, leave him alone!

07:55.622 --> 07:57.690
You son of a...

08:26.190 --> 08:28.023
What the hell?

08:29.355 --> 08:31.221
He's got a goddamn fake leg!

08:31.223 --> 08:33.854
He's a goddamn cripple. Shit!

08:33.856 --> 08:37.623
Ah, man. Screw this. Let's get out of here.

08:48.255 --> 08:50.056
Here.

09:27.723 --> 09:29.654
Hey.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.724
Get in.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.824
Come on.

09:47.623 --> 09:51.690
What did you think was
gonna happen back there?

09:56.556 --> 09:59.689
- How long were you over there?
- You know what your problem is?

10:03.589 --> 10:05.953
You're like every other hick in this town.

10:05.955 --> 10:11.487
Full of opinions on things
you know nothing about.

10:11.489 --> 10:13.954
Scared shitless of losing
what you think you have.

10:13.956 --> 10:15.953
- And what's that?
- A future.

10:15.955 --> 10:18.454
- A future?
- Yeah.

10:18.456 --> 10:21.755
I'm not the one picking
fights I know I can't win.

10:21.757 --> 10:24.256
Asshole.

10:28.557 --> 10:30.690
Pull in here.

11:11.557 --> 11:13.624
Shit.

11:18.657 --> 11:21.720
Guess you forgot.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.588
What happened?

11:23.590 --> 11:27.420
Accident. Looks worse than it is.

11:27.422 --> 11:28.820
When'd you get in?

11:28.822 --> 11:32.023
This afternoon, like we talked about.

11:34.356 --> 11:36.624
I'll clean you up.

11:53.390 --> 11:57.023
Lot of luggage for one week.

11:59.255 --> 12:01.024
I'm staying.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.123
How long?

12:08.490 --> 12:11.487
You quit... why?

12:11.489 --> 12:14.320
I don't want to talk about
it, not while you're like this.

12:14.322 --> 12:16.721
Like what? Disappointed?

12:16.723 --> 12:18.354
What happened? Some boy break your heart?

12:18.356 --> 12:20.221
No.

12:20.223 --> 12:22.587
Well, I didn't send you out
there to quit, Annabelle.

12:22.589 --> 12:25.886
I've been busting my ass every damn day
in that shop so you can have a future.

12:25.888 --> 12:28.687
I didn't quit.

12:28.689 --> 12:32.291
Your last two payments didn't go through.

12:34.590 --> 12:39.657
Shit. So my... I'm sorry.

12:42.490 --> 12:46.755
I just need another week.
I'll call them, fix it.

12:46.757 --> 12:49.387
- Forget it.
- No, I'll take care of it.

12:49.389 --> 12:52.720
No. Stop, I...

12:52.722 --> 12:57.488
I don't want you working
yourself to the bone... not again.

13:02.756 --> 13:05.789
You think she would've wanted this?

13:12.689 --> 13:15.723
Don't tell me what she wanted.

13:24.489 --> 13:27.255
Happy Birthday.

17:04.290 --> 17:10.853
He didn't come home last night.
He's not answering his cell.

17:10.855 --> 17:14.723
Sheriff, please. There's something
seriously wrong. He wouldn't...

17:16.388 --> 17:19.089
24 hours?

17:29.456 --> 17:31.757
Ned?

17:33.255 --> 17:36.886
I'm looking for my dad.
He hasn't come home.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.887
Neither has my wife.

17:38.889 --> 17:41.619
She took the Camaro.

17:41.621 --> 17:44.188
Drove the boy to Canada.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.790
She's afraid he'll get drafted.

17:51.621 --> 17:53.819
Have you seen David?

17:53.821 --> 17:56.920
Your dad's a good man.

17:56.922 --> 18:00.221
Guys like him, they run on hope.

18:00.223 --> 18:04.190
But... you can't eat hope.

18:05.855 --> 18:08.353
Hey.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.619
We haven't got the chance to tell you.

18:11.621 --> 18:17.719
Real sorry about your
mom. She was a good one.

18:48.722 --> 18:51.890
Dad?

20:15.856 --> 20:18.390
David.

20:24.956 --> 20:27.255
Annabelle.

20:31.222 --> 20:33.520
I don't mean to be insensitive...

20:33.522 --> 20:37.452
but I was kind of hoping you
could answer a question for me.

20:37.454 --> 20:41.653
Your mother underwent a kidney
transplant at St. Luke's.

20:41.655 --> 20:44.221
Your father is listed as the donor.

20:44.223 --> 20:47.319
Her body rejected the transplant.

20:47.321 --> 20:49.786
See, what I'm trying to understand is...

20:49.788 --> 20:51.920
there must have been some kind of mistake.

20:51.922 --> 20:54.553
The x-rays...

20:54.555 --> 20:57.886
Your father has two perfectly
functioning kidneys of his own.

22:33.622 --> 22:36.820
<i>We've just reached the
point of no return.</i>

22:36.822 --> 22:39.921
<i>Ultimatum from Russia and
China changes everything.</i>

22:39.923 --> 22:42.554
Not hungry?

22:42.556 --> 22:45.887
<i>And with no sign of the
U.S. or Israel backing down.</i>

22:45.889 --> 22:49.753
In the hospital, you kept calling her...

22:49.755 --> 22:52.653
talking to her like she was right there.

22:52.655 --> 22:56.187
<i>Thermo-nuclear war and
at the very least...</i>

22:56.189 --> 23:00.720
<i>a conflict that will just overshadow
absolutely anything that's going on.</i>

23:00.722 --> 23:06.956
I know it's been tough, but we're only
going to make it if we work at this together.

23:08.589 --> 23:11.156
Okay?

23:12.888 --> 23:14.989
Yeah.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.252
<i>There's a great deal of
secrecy surrounding...</i>

23:19.254 --> 23:21.487
<i>the General's next move.</i>

23:21.489 --> 23:23.754
<i>But there are rumors that ground
forces are making their way...</i>

23:23.756 --> 23:26.619
<i>across the border into
Tehran in the coming days.</i>

23:26.621 --> 23:31.386
<i>Air raids have
already intensified...</i>

23:31.388 --> 23:33.820
<i>and we have word that
special forces troops...</i>

23:33.822 --> 23:35.954
<i>have infiltrated several
critical outposts closer in...</i>

23:35.956 --> 23:38.753
<i>paving the way for
aggressive ground attacks.</i>

23:38.755 --> 23:42.853
<i>The first wave of US draft troops have
arrived from training in Afghanistan...</i>

23:42.855 --> 23:47.287
<i>despite stern warnings from
Russian, Chinese and French leaders.</i>

23:47.289 --> 23:49.623
David.

24:27.355 --> 24:28.856
David.

24:31.889 --> 24:34.755
Jane?

24:43.956 --> 24:46.386
I miss you.

24:46.388 --> 24:49.887
I know.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.090
What's happening to me?

24:54.555 --> 24:58.487
You remember the night I
told you I was pregnant?

24:58.489 --> 25:03.419
You said you didn't want to
bring a child into this place...

25:03.421 --> 25:09.255
but as long as we were
together there was always hope.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.519
You have to create it.

25:17.521 --> 25:23.686
<i>There isn't much time... for Annie.</i>

25:23.688 --> 25:28.219
<i>The President has assured us
that the disarmament of Iran...</i>

25:28.221 --> 25:32.387
<i>will insure a sense of security
for generations to come...</i>

25:32.389 --> 25:36.219
<i>but what we're dealing with
is the complete and utter...</i>

25:36.221 --> 25:38.820
<i>destabilization of an entire region.</i>

25:38.822 --> 25:44.619
<i>We've caused the displacement of
thousands of families into refugee camps.</i>

25:44.621 --> 25:48.887
<i>These families are suffering from
starvation due to overcrowding.</i>

25:48.889 --> 25:52.453
<i>The question we've got
to ask ourselves is...</i>

25:52.455 --> 25:55.655
<i>when will the bloodshed
come to an end?</i>

26:19.421 --> 26:22.386
I wasn't expecting you to
come all the way out here.

26:22.388 --> 26:28.390
I came so you could explain to me in
person why, in the middle of a war...

26:29.621 --> 26:32.287
are you still chasing space rocks?

26:32.289 --> 26:35.487
I'm sure you can understand why
we haven't been able to leave.

26:35.489 --> 26:36.919
The data is undeniable.

26:36.921 --> 26:38.419
You were ordered to shut down.

26:38.421 --> 26:41.619
I can't... not yet. We're too close.

26:41.621 --> 26:44.353
You were Army Intelligence
before you joined us...

26:44.355 --> 26:50.888
four years in Pakistan, yet you chose an
assignment completely unbefitting your skill set.

26:52.189 --> 26:54.286
I felt I could make a difference this time.

26:54.288 --> 26:58.787
This war needs men like
you on the front line.

26:58.789 --> 27:02.519
Men with scars like yours, win wars.

27:02.521 --> 27:07.486
What we are about to find here,
it could change everything.

27:07.488 --> 27:09.486
You wouldn't need war.

27:09.488 --> 27:14.886
The country is dying. People are starving.

27:14.888 --> 27:19.920
Desperate for opportunity... hope.

27:19.922 --> 27:25.219
War gives them a reason... purpose.

27:25.221 --> 27:27.252
Now, we don't need to
end this war, not yet.

27:27.254 --> 27:33.989
But as is the case with any conflict,
we do need a strategic advantage.

27:35.656 --> 27:39.853
Although the specimen we
have hasn't survived...

27:39.855 --> 27:42.452
but there may be a living sample somewhere.

27:42.454 --> 27:45.320
It seems to require temperate climates.

27:45.322 --> 27:48.520
It's unsustainable above 80 degrees.

27:48.522 --> 27:51.420
What's the status of our patient?

27:51.422 --> 27:57.319
Dr. Wilkins advises that Mr. Gutierrez
may not survive the procedure.

27:57.321 --> 28:03.089
We're at 23 casualties a day in Iran... 23.

28:12.655 --> 28:14.553
Open him up.

28:14.555 --> 28:17.223
I want to know everything about it.

28:18.254 --> 28:21.852
Hey. What are we telling the wife?

28:21.854 --> 28:25.252
You can tell her that Mr.
Gutierrez suffered cardiac arrest...

28:25.254 --> 28:29.252
in the attempt to save
him from a lethal virus.

28:29.254 --> 28:33.289
That his sacrifice has spared the
country from a deadly epidemic.

29:21.288 --> 29:25.222
<i>Oh, messy, messy face.</i>

29:28.622 --> 29:30.886
<i>Okay... silly me.</i>

29:30.888 --> 29:33.252
<i>Now push her on the swing.</i>

29:33.254 --> 29:34.720
<i>Look out.</i>

29:34.722 --> 29:37.952
- <i>Whoo! Daddy will catch you.</i>
- <i>Touching the camera.</i>

29:37.954 --> 29:40.888
<i>There we go. I'm gonna
tickle your feet.</i>

29:43.388 --> 29:47.253
<i>Okay. Want me to push
you on the swing?</i>

29:47.255 --> 29:51.819
<i>Oh, you're a good girl... good girl.</i>

29:51.821 --> 29:53.220
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

29:53.222 --> 29:54.653
<i>Look at the camera.</i>

29:54.655 --> 29:56.288
<i>I want a round.</i>

29:59.455 --> 30:01.920
What are you doing?

30:01.922 --> 30:08.687
Writing a letter to General Corazon.

30:08.689 --> 30:11.520
What for?

30:11.522 --> 30:14.187
The age of advanced
technological warfare...

30:14.189 --> 30:17.320
and we're sending draftees
to die in the desert.

30:17.322 --> 30:19.587
And here I am unemployed and impotent.

30:19.589 --> 30:22.520
Fuck draftees. I can still hold a gun.

30:22.522 --> 30:24.823
Yeah?

30:27.588 --> 30:29.955
I'd rather starve to death here.

30:32.855 --> 30:37.219
Beats the pity stares and
those 11:00AM support groups.

30:37.221 --> 30:39.453
Nothing worse than being
surrounded by a bunch of guys...

30:39.455 --> 30:41.487
claiming that the silver
lining of the colostomy bag...

30:41.489 --> 30:43.920
is that you don't have to
wait to the commercial to piss.

30:43.922 --> 30:47.253
You don't want to go back.

30:47.255 --> 30:50.486
See pain, I can deal with that.

30:50.488 --> 30:53.853
It's the inactivity that sucks.

30:53.855 --> 30:58.622
World's going to hell anyway.
We're just reaping what we've sown.

31:02.688 --> 31:08.886
Hey, you know what
Acrotomophilia is, right?

31:08.888 --> 31:10.520
Anima... what?

31:10.522 --> 31:13.586
It's perverts getting turned on by stumps.

31:13.588 --> 31:15.919
- No joke.
- Why would you bring that up?

31:15.921 --> 31:18.956
You got one on your six.

31:26.821 --> 31:29.155
Give me a second.

31:31.922 --> 31:34.819
I get ten percent.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.553
What do you want?

31:36.555 --> 31:40.222
Still looking for a job?

31:52.355 --> 31:54.189
Run the winch.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.689
What are we haulin'?

32:30.255 --> 32:32.622
Bring it up!

32:46.254 --> 32:48.054
What the hell is that?

32:49.521 --> 32:51.689
Help me here.

33:07.754 --> 33:10.688
Come on.

33:15.489 --> 33:17.990
Get in.

33:49.221 --> 33:51.586
<i>What we're seeing now
are the arrival...</i>

33:51.588 --> 33:54.518
<i>of half a dozen Chinese and Russian
warships into the Persian Gulf...</i>

33:54.520 --> 33:58.286
<i>what the President is calling
a futile show of intimidation...</i>

33:58.288 --> 34:02.188
<i>against the coalition forces
currently occupying Iran.</i>

34:03.620 --> 34:05.923
What's this?

34:07.453 --> 34:09.819
I'm putting half in the barn.

34:09.821 --> 34:12.953
The other half is going to Goodwill.

34:12.955 --> 34:15.822
Fresh start for both of us, right?

34:17.786 --> 34:19.885
This your mom's stuff?

34:19.887 --> 34:23.219
Yeah, well, you haven't been around much...

34:23.221 --> 34:27.987
so I figure that this place could
use a little bit of a spring clean.

34:29.587 --> 34:32.621
This is one of her favorites.

34:40.453 --> 34:46.418
That ski-hike... we did
in Vermont that winter...

34:46.420 --> 34:50.054
and the blizzard rolled in
right over the top of us.

34:57.488 --> 35:04.286
You were so scared, but
your mom held you so tight.

35:04.288 --> 35:06.788
You remember what she said?

35:09.621 --> 35:13.788
Nothing bad will ever last.

35:22.755 --> 35:26.689
You don't need to pretend
she was never here to move on.

36:16.420 --> 36:18.519
You're due for an upgrade, man.

36:18.521 --> 36:21.386
Christ, Zach, this one works fine.

36:21.388 --> 36:25.319
- Ooh!
- What's the matter?

36:25.321 --> 36:27.789
You all right?

36:30.587 --> 36:34.222
Yeah. Leg's playing up.

36:35.887 --> 36:39.219
Phantoms... I get 'em all the time.

36:39.221 --> 36:41.920
It's different if you
see your limbs come off.

36:41.922 --> 36:43.955
You get closure.

36:45.922 --> 36:48.618
How much did that perv pay you?

36:48.620 --> 36:50.853
- $40.
- That all?

36:50.855 --> 36:52.752
Well, it's something.

36:52.754 --> 36:56.518
One minute it's a job, next
he's got his cock in your mouth.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.719
Makes sense to me. What
else are we good for?

36:59.721 --> 37:02.553
They think you'll charge half
the price for just one knee pad?

37:02.555 --> 37:05.385
Why don't you put that in your letter? Hm?

37:05.387 --> 37:07.822
What's that supposed to mean?

37:09.521 --> 37:12.055
Okay. You ready to do this?

37:13.921 --> 37:16.187
For all the good it's gonna do.

37:16.189 --> 37:20.355
We don't want your fascist war!
We don't need your draft no more!

37:23.788 --> 37:25.518
We don't we want your fascist war!

37:25.520 --> 37:27.619
We don't we need your draft no more!

37:34.887 --> 37:39.319
All right, all right, come
on, people. Let's wrap this up.

37:39.321 --> 37:41.187
We don't we want your fascist war!

37:41.189 --> 37:43.356
- We don't we need...
- What the...

37:48.321 --> 37:50.286
Come on.

37:50.288 --> 37:54.286
Hey, sir? Hey, you look like a smart guy.

37:54.288 --> 37:56.786
Sign this and you won't have to worry
about your kids getting blown up.

37:56.788 --> 37:59.021
How 'bout it?

38:00.354 --> 38:03.385
Traitor.

38:03.387 --> 38:07.187
- Say it again! Say it again!
- Hey! Hey!

38:07.189 --> 38:10.886
Say it again! I'll kill you! Get off me!

38:10.888 --> 38:15.021
That's it, people! Enjoy
the freak show! Huh?

38:16.854 --> 38:20.188
Want to spend a night in a jail cell?

38:34.855 --> 38:36.753
Oh, Jesus, you got to get
that leg checked out, man.

38:36.755 --> 38:39.252
Go.

38:39.254 --> 38:41.055
Just go.

39:59.387 --> 40:02.654
What the hell is that?

40:05.488 --> 40:07.788
What the hell did you do to me?

40:24.955 --> 40:27.718
Dad?

40:27.720 --> 40:29.654
Get some water.

40:31.321 --> 40:33.088
Now, Annie!

40:36.220 --> 40:38.154
Breathe, breathe.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.885
He needs to go to the hospital.

40:41.887 --> 40:43.419
No hospitals.

40:43.421 --> 40:44.819
Are you crazy? He'll bleed to death.

40:44.821 --> 40:47.022
No, he won't.

40:49.354 --> 40:50.753
It's healing him.

40:50.755 --> 40:52.385
What is that?

40:52.387 --> 40:54.752
I need you to stay here and watch him.

40:54.754 --> 40:57.686
Keep your eyes on him. I'll be back.

41:11.620 --> 41:14.218
So what's the plan?

41:14.220 --> 41:19.485
Our movement orders came in.
We report to Philly at 0800.

41:19.487 --> 41:22.819
I'm sorry to disappoint, gentlemen,
but we're not going to Philadelphia.

41:22.821 --> 41:24.351
What?

41:24.353 --> 41:26.318
- Give me three samples.
- Now what do you mean?

41:26.320 --> 41:28.818
We just had another
one land... north-east.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.919
But our intel is thin at best.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.452
How do we explain this to Deputy Ep...

41:32.454 --> 41:34.852
Deputy Epstein will come around.

41:34.854 --> 41:38.618
I'm sure he'll be grateful for every
dead soldier we don't need to bury.

41:38.620 --> 41:43.252
A blind man can see... what
the fuck else do you need?

41:43.254 --> 41:45.688
We're going north-east.

41:49.288 --> 41:50.753
Medic!

41:50.755 --> 41:52.653
- Hey.
- Are you okay? Stay calm.

41:52.655 --> 41:54.819
- Just rest.
- You're okay?

41:54.821 --> 41:57.619
You're gonna start bleeding again.

41:57.621 --> 42:01.255
It'll be okay. Just rest. Okay?

42:03.720 --> 42:07.355
It's okay. It'll be okay.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.486
What the hell is going on here?

42:30.488 --> 42:31.886
We need to move him.

42:31.888 --> 42:35.189
Grab the door. Grab the door!

42:41.720 --> 42:44.155
Oh, hold him.

42:45.254 --> 42:46.753
What is that?

42:46.755 --> 42:49.289
It's dying from the heat.

42:58.788 --> 43:01.918
We gotta get him closer.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.188
Bring that over.

43:18.487 --> 43:21.685
What's it doing?

43:21.687 --> 43:24.755
You'll see. Just watch.

43:25.954 --> 43:28.718
Hey... it's okay.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.788
Look. See?

43:35.554 --> 43:37.088
Hey.

43:49.587 --> 43:55.419
It's okay... he'll be here.

44:52.721 --> 44:54.655
Hey.

44:56.953 --> 44:59.419
You okay?

44:59.421 --> 45:01.922
It's real. I'm not dreaming.

45:04.687 --> 45:07.155
I hope not.

45:10.221 --> 45:12.155
What's it like?

45:16.787 --> 45:19.388
Strange.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.787
Where is he?

45:32.487 --> 45:34.955
Dad?

45:37.220 --> 45:39.687
You gotta see this.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.518
What's it for?

45:54.520 --> 45:56.951
Protection.

45:56.953 --> 46:01.186
Protection? From what?

46:01.188 --> 46:03.718
Something we can't prevent.

46:03.720 --> 46:10.552
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but you've
seen what it can do. You've felt it.

46:10.554 --> 46:13.185
This... this is a gift.

46:13.187 --> 46:17.751
You have no idea what this thing
is or what else it's capable of.

46:17.753 --> 46:21.319
You have to trust me with this, Annie.

46:21.321 --> 46:25.685
Everything'll be fine... I promise.

46:25.687 --> 46:28.622
We're gonna need a ton of steel.

46:32.921 --> 46:36.485
Ramon's got me on inventory. Shit
job, but who's complaining, right?

46:36.487 --> 46:39.919
Guy's got his hands in so
many pies, still bitches.

46:39.921 --> 46:43.817
Half the shit I don't even
ask about. How you doing?

46:43.819 --> 46:45.519
You know.

46:45.521 --> 46:47.285
You should hook up with
Mickey, trade some stocks.

46:47.287 --> 46:49.186
Yeah, that'd be great.

46:49.188 --> 46:50.919
That old metal works,
though, that's where it's at.

46:50.921 --> 46:52.852
Swear to God if I had the
money, I'd re-open it myself.

46:52.854 --> 46:54.652
Come on, that place's
nothing but a graveyard.

46:54.654 --> 46:56.619
Hey, you could be my foreman.

46:56.621 --> 46:57.885
Thanks.

46:57.887 --> 47:00.218
So this is the shit you wanted?

47:00.220 --> 47:04.354
Yeah. I owe you.

47:05.420 --> 47:07.851
How's Annie holding up?

47:07.853 --> 47:11.285
She's worried. Who wouldn't be?

47:11.287 --> 47:16.251
No, I mean since Jane.

47:16.253 --> 47:19.885
I don't know. She's fine.

47:19.887 --> 47:22.787
Maybe better than I am.

47:25.220 --> 47:30.585
You know, I always wanted to kill you.

47:30.587 --> 47:34.354
Scoring the one girl on the
drill team that turned me down.

47:36.654 --> 47:40.452
I was strong side linebacker.

47:40.454 --> 47:43.887
You always were a lucky
son-of-a-bitch though, huh?

47:47.421 --> 47:49.254
Hey, thanks.

47:50.288 --> 47:52.752
Hey, how old are you now?

47:52.754 --> 47:55.922
Keep dreaming.

47:57.321 --> 48:00.486
Bottoms up.

48:08.453 --> 48:11.354
- We should go to a titty bar.
- Yeah.

48:18.287 --> 48:20.617
There you go.

48:28.854 --> 48:31.855
Yep. Got em.

49:15.519 --> 49:18.053
Come on, let's go.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.386
This is it.

50:05.388 --> 50:06.919
You sure?

50:06.921 --> 50:10.652
Yeah. No one's set foot in here in years.

50:10.654 --> 50:12.655
Let's bring in that cement mixer.

50:36.354 --> 50:39.251
Should I be concerned
about any of this business?

50:39.253 --> 50:42.621
Oh, not at all, Sheriff.
It's just protocol.

50:55.620 --> 50:58.450
Appears to be stable.

50:58.452 --> 51:00.120
Where's the rest of it?

51:02.320 --> 51:03.851
You're supposed to tell me.

51:03.853 --> 51:07.886
Do you believe in
coincidences, Agent Stipe?

51:09.254 --> 51:12.252
In my experience, there are
no coincidences, Sheriff.

51:12.254 --> 51:14.584
You might want to talk
to David Chamberlain.

51:14.586 --> 51:18.718
Local guy, crashed his car
near here the other night.

51:18.720 --> 51:23.818
Strangest thing, too. Not a scratch on him.

51:23.820 --> 51:26.451
It's unprecedented.

51:26.453 --> 51:28.652
At first we couldn't
understand what we were seeing.

51:28.654 --> 51:31.752
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization
identified the presence...

51:31.754 --> 51:34.319
of hundreds of different
alleles for each gene.

51:34.321 --> 51:39.418
But this genetic information isn't organized
into chromosomes as we understand them.

51:39.420 --> 51:46.418
So far, we've isolated multiple sequences
resembling various plant and animal strands.

51:46.420 --> 51:48.918
Some of these strands
even appear to be human.

51:48.920 --> 51:53.285
What we're dealing with here is
a living sample of a biogenesis.

51:53.287 --> 51:54.818
Evolution?

51:54.820 --> 51:59.952
No, no. This precedes
evolution. It's creation.

51:59.954 --> 52:03.154
Who'd have thought... that's an amoeba.

52:05.187 --> 52:07.885
I don't know what to do.

52:07.887 --> 52:14.154
You always said that he'd
do things in his own way.

52:16.753 --> 52:20.687
The fact is that without you he...

52:25.486 --> 52:31.088
He did his best and... I hate him for it.

52:38.319 --> 52:39.954
I don't want to hate him.

52:41.353 --> 52:47.384
I never could quite understand
how you... kept loving him.

52:47.386 --> 52:50.721
No matter how many times he let you down.

52:53.319 --> 52:56.685
I miss you so much, Mom.

53:14.352 --> 53:16.087
This'll work.

53:56.787 --> 54:00.951
You're standing too close.

54:00.953 --> 54:02.752
What?

54:02.754 --> 54:04.818
Unless you're planning on
setting yourself alight.

54:04.820 --> 54:07.350
You must be Annabelle.

54:07.352 --> 54:12.517
Special agent Julius Stipe...
National Science Agency.

54:12.519 --> 54:16.551
We'd like to ask your
father some questions.

54:16.553 --> 54:17.784
Is he here?

54:17.786 --> 54:19.886
No.

54:21.187 --> 54:25.088
Oh, no need to be alarmed.
It's just protocol.

54:32.787 --> 54:35.187
What do you want with my father?

54:43.754 --> 54:46.450
We're looking for something.

54:46.452 --> 54:48.718
We're hoping he might be
able to help us find it.

54:56.654 --> 54:59.417
Got a little drunk with the boys.

54:59.419 --> 55:01.318
It was my birthday.

55:01.320 --> 55:04.622
I came home to celebrate with my daughter.

55:08.287 --> 55:10.350
I can't recall seeing anything
but a light in the sky...

55:10.352 --> 55:12.517
and that was when I lost control.

55:12.519 --> 55:16.621
Not much more I remember
before I blacked out.

55:24.920 --> 55:28.953
You ever been to the Air and Space
Museum in D.C., Mr. Chamberlain?

55:31.619 --> 55:33.720
No.

55:35.487 --> 55:37.651
My mother used to drive
me there every summer.

55:37.653 --> 55:40.251
She'd let me wander the place for hours.

55:40.253 --> 55:46.385
I learned so many things about
the universe and time and space.

55:46.387 --> 55:49.351
It's really incredible
everything we've accomplished...

55:49.353 --> 55:54.484
but what's even more fascinating
is how little we actually know.

55:54.486 --> 55:58.250
I've always believed that
if we found real evidence...

55:58.252 --> 56:00.652
of something greater than ourselves...

56:00.654 --> 56:03.284
something that inspired the human race...

56:03.286 --> 56:06.753
then maybe the world would have peace.

56:12.520 --> 56:18.121
Now this thing you found, it just might
be the miracle people are hoping for.

56:22.387 --> 56:25.421
Can't say I believe in
miracles all that much.

56:29.186 --> 56:33.285
You have a kidney in your body that
wasn't there before, Mr. Chamberlain.

56:33.287 --> 56:35.854
So, please don't lie to me.

56:46.187 --> 56:50.654
The last person to come in contact
with an object like the one you found...

56:55.387 --> 56:58.721
he thought it had healed him, too.

57:04.619 --> 57:07.918
That's where I kept it.

57:07.920 --> 57:13.417
Wasn't long before I noticed it didn't
react well to the humidity in here.

57:13.419 --> 57:17.384
Thing had just... melted.

57:17.386 --> 57:19.921
Melted?

57:22.586 --> 57:24.818
Things been tough, Mr. Chamberlain?

57:24.820 --> 57:27.721
Huh?

57:31.420 --> 57:34.184
Since the death of your wife.

57:34.186 --> 57:35.885
Must have been very hard for you...

57:35.887 --> 57:40.787
knowing there was nothing
you could do to save her.

57:42.253 --> 57:44.653
Yeah.

57:46.886 --> 57:48.518
Sorry I can't be more help to you.

57:48.520 --> 57:53.221
No, you've been more
than helpful. Thank you.

58:12.186 --> 58:13.285
Annie?

58:13.287 --> 58:15.384
They know you have it.

58:15.386 --> 58:17.817
They're gonna find it. What then?

58:17.819 --> 58:20.285
They take you away? Cut
you open like that old man?

58:20.287 --> 58:21.784
No, that won't happen.

58:21.786 --> 58:23.318
Those men were here, in our house.

58:23.320 --> 58:26.950
It found me for a reason. She found me.

58:26.952 --> 58:28.851
Who? Who found you?

58:28.853 --> 58:33.317
Your mom, Annie. She showed
me something's gonna happen.

58:33.319 --> 58:39.317
No. This... this thing is messing
with your head, changing you.

58:39.319 --> 58:42.318
- Can't you see that?
- No, you're wrong!

58:42.320 --> 58:44.752
She's gone, Dad.

58:44.754 --> 58:47.651
You didn't want to see it when she was
lying in that hospital bed all alone...

58:47.653 --> 58:49.484
but she's gone and you
can't bring her back.

58:49.486 --> 58:53.218
No! No.

58:53.220 --> 58:56.718
I won't let them take it away.

58:56.720 --> 58:59.654
You know what it showed me?

59:00.887 --> 59:03.621
It showed me everything I wanted to forget.

59:05.219 --> 59:10.851
Just before she died, she
asked me where you were...

59:10.853 --> 59:13.120
when you were coming to see her.

59:15.287 --> 59:17.121
But you never came.

59:39.654 --> 59:41.820
Annie?

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:44.618
Hey, Mickey, I need a favor.

01:01:10.586 --> 01:01:12.887
He's driving in circles.

01:01:14.452 --> 01:01:15.850
Bring him in.

01:01:41.352 --> 01:01:45.354
How you doing? Nice suit.

01:01:50.819 --> 01:01:52.517
We have a situation.

01:01:52.519 --> 01:01:53.716
You lost him.

01:01:53.718 --> 01:01:55.184
For now.

01:01:55.186 --> 01:01:57.621
The daughter.

01:02:00.386 --> 01:02:03.918
<i>U.S. casualties have risen
well above 35 soldiers a day...</i>

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.585
<i>as the advancement
into Tehran continues.</i>

01:02:06.587 --> 01:02:10.684
<i>Members of Congress have met to persuade
the President and General Corazon...</i>

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:13.351
- <i>to halt any further movement...</i>
- What the hell is that?

01:02:13.353 --> 01:02:15.418
- <i>in Iran until an agreement can be reached...</i>
- This isn't gonna end well.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.716
<i>...with Russia and China.</i>

01:02:17.718 --> 01:02:21.450
They'll shake hands,
exchange pleasantries...

01:02:21.452 --> 01:02:25.618
then go back to killing children again.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.921
Ramon, you okay?

01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:35.853
Explain why some assholes
are moving my scrap.

01:02:37.719 --> 01:02:41.851
- And a truck that only you have the keys to.
- What?

01:02:41.853 --> 01:02:43.883
This some kind of inside job?

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:46.385
Inside job? I don't know shit about this.

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:51.021
No? It sure looks like
your boy Chamberlain to me.

01:02:55.387 --> 01:02:56.751
Dave.

01:02:56.753 --> 01:03:01.054
Don't fuck with me,
Cerillo. Get my truck back.

01:03:41.486 --> 01:03:44.621
Zach?

01:03:55.819 --> 01:03:57.921
You okay?

01:04:01.319 --> 01:04:02.987
Look at me.

01:04:45.619 --> 01:04:48.287
Didn't know where else to go.

01:04:52.219 --> 01:04:55.285
She was sick.

01:04:55.287 --> 01:04:58.119
He did everything he could.

01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:04.550
Gave her a part of himself...

01:05:04.552 --> 01:05:08.218
but she kept getting worse.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.152
All he did was work.

01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:19.654
Trying to pay for treatments
we couldn't afford.

01:05:21.453 --> 01:05:26.318
I know he thinks he's doing this for me...

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.653
but I can't be the reason.

01:05:32.353 --> 01:05:35.417
They'll kill for it.

01:05:35.419 --> 01:05:38.616
I won't let that happen.

01:05:38.618 --> 01:05:40.621
Okay?

01:05:42.352 --> 01:05:44.251
I'll take you to your dad...

01:05:44.253 --> 01:05:48.953
but first... I want you to meet someone.

01:05:54.386 --> 01:05:56.252
Jim.

01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:01.317
I brought a friend.

01:06:01.319 --> 01:06:03.786
This is Annabelle.

01:06:05.387 --> 01:06:09.621
You know the T-bones they're serving
here are shipped in from China?

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.250
You believe that?

01:06:15.252 --> 01:06:19.252
Where the hell is all our meat,
if we gotta eat cows from China?

01:06:23.586 --> 01:06:26.417
Hey.

01:06:26.419 --> 01:06:29.951
I've found a way to make things better.

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:32.616
The way it was before.

01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:36.318
I don't need another one of your goddamned
arms or legs, Zach. I got nowhere to go.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.020
Hey, listen. Listen to me. Hey!

01:06:47.785 --> 01:06:53.086
It's healed. It's healed.

01:06:56.852 --> 01:06:59.720
That's a nice trick.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.917
Come with me.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:07.919
I can make you better.

01:07:11.686 --> 01:07:14.616
Maybe another time.

01:07:14.618 --> 01:07:16.516
Celtics are playing the Bulls tonight.

01:07:16.518 --> 01:07:20.153
Not many games left.

01:07:21.553 --> 01:07:24.787
Who knows if there'll even
be another season, right?

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:34.817
I'm coming back and I'm
gonna get you out of here.

01:07:34.819 --> 01:07:37.253
Okay?

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.019
Let's go for a ride, Corporal.

01:08:07.585 --> 01:08:11.354
Don't be a hero.

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.153
Tony?

01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:05.287
We used to play in here.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.283
You stole Ramon's truck. For this?

01:09:08.286 --> 01:09:09.850
What the fuck is this?

01:09:09.852 --> 01:09:12.316
- You couldn't begin to understand.
- Understand?

01:09:12.318 --> 01:09:14.417
After all I've done for you?

01:09:14.419 --> 01:09:16.816
This is the only way. This
thing is bigger than you.

01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:19.751
Bullshit!

01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:21.651
I got responsibilities.

01:09:21.653 --> 01:09:23.550
- Dave, I'm not going down for you.
- You won't go down.

01:09:23.551 --> 01:09:26.952
- I'm not going down for you or no one.
- I'm telling you.

01:09:28.452 --> 01:09:30.786
Yeah, police.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:38.252
Shit!

01:09:46.586 --> 01:09:48.853
Tony?

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:08.219
Dave?

01:11:10.852 --> 01:11:14.283
How long since we last did this?

01:11:14.285 --> 01:11:18.583
Thanksgiving... two years ago.

01:11:18.585 --> 01:11:21.619
That was the last time
I could move like this.

01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:29.753
You're so beautiful.

01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:33.216
Where is she, David?

01:11:33.218 --> 01:11:35.918
- She doesn't trust me.
- She wants to.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.250
No.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:44.249
No, I've done a terrible
thing. I don't deserve this.

01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:48.851
I know. It was never meant for you.

01:11:48.853 --> 01:11:53.784
You have to find them.

01:11:53.786 --> 01:11:56.286
You're out of time.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.616
<i>This has now been confirmed.</i>

01:12:05.618 --> 01:12:10.616
<i>Bagram Airbase, the U.S. military's primary
staging point for Operation Terminus...</i>

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:14.884
<i>has been attacked by a long
range WMD of Russian origin.</i>

01:12:14.886 --> 01:12:19.349
<i>We have unconfirmed reports this
was in fact a nuclear missile.</i>

01:12:19.351 --> 01:12:24.350
<i>The search for survivors has been impeded
by the danger and instability of the site.</i>

01:12:24.352 --> 01:12:28.550
Says here you were wounded in combat.

01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:30.751
Left leg amputated below the knee.

01:12:30.753 --> 01:12:34.717
<i>In the Pentagon report that
we are now at DEFCON 1...</i>

01:12:34.719 --> 01:12:37.950
<i>meaning the nuclear
retaliation against Russia...</i>

01:12:37.952 --> 01:12:41.685
Well, by the looks of it, things
have taken quite a turn for you.

01:12:44.718 --> 01:12:48.652
Think of the good we
could achieve, Corporal.

01:12:50.252 --> 01:12:54.020
Field casualties would drop exponentially.

01:12:55.618 --> 01:12:58.783
We could actually have a
chance at ending this war.

01:12:58.785 --> 01:13:02.219
Don't you see that?

01:13:17.586 --> 01:13:21.187
You need to tell me where it is, Annabelle.

01:13:23.219 --> 01:13:28.354
Wherever he's taken it, you
can be sure it's far from here.

01:13:29.753 --> 01:13:31.753
Touching.

01:14:13.186 --> 01:14:14.617
Stop!

01:14:14.619 --> 01:14:17.987
Tell me where it is!

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.820
I gave you a chance... on your knees.

01:14:56.752 --> 01:14:58.783
We got something by the barn.

01:14:58.785 --> 01:15:00.917
He's here.

01:15:00.919 --> 01:15:02.652
Get him.

01:15:08.952 --> 01:15:12.287
Move around back. Go.

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:25.716
Mr. Chamberlain.

01:15:25.718 --> 01:15:27.882
We have to go, Annie.

01:15:27.884 --> 01:15:29.783
We're not leaving him here.

01:15:29.785 --> 01:15:32.152
The key.

01:15:42.486 --> 01:15:46.316
Turn around.

01:15:46.318 --> 01:15:48.619
Slowly!

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:57.319
What now?

01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:11.220
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:15.349
Come on, Annie. We've
got to get out of here.

01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:17.318
Come on.

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:30.949
Get the rifle.

01:16:30.951 --> 01:16:33.153
Give me the gun.

01:16:51.752 --> 01:16:54.186
Annie!

01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:59.886
Come on, let's go!

01:17:14.286 --> 01:17:19.815
Stay... stay with me. Stay,
stay. It's okay. It's okay, Annie.

01:17:19.817 --> 01:17:22.186
Okay, Dad.

01:17:23.486 --> 01:17:25.417
It's okay.

01:17:25.419 --> 01:17:27.686
Come on!

01:17:29.884 --> 01:17:34.883
All right... they're headed across town.

01:17:34.885 --> 01:17:38.120
This isn't right.

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:41.815
We're on the brink of nuclear war.

01:17:41.817 --> 01:17:44.183
I need you to understand that.

01:17:44.185 --> 01:17:48.384
Maybe this thing wasn't sent to win wars.

01:17:48.386 --> 01:17:50.651
Just drive.

01:17:50.653 --> 01:17:55.853
You hear me? Just fucking drive.

01:17:59.352 --> 01:18:04.119
She needs you. She's waiting for you.

01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:09.952
Baby, I did this for you.

01:18:53.785 --> 01:18:56.286
Come on.

01:18:58.385 --> 01:19:02.284
Please, please. Please!

01:19:02.286 --> 01:19:04.053
Fuck!

01:19:31.386 --> 01:19:32.716
They're here.

01:19:32.718 --> 01:19:35.186
Sorry, baby.

01:19:57.651 --> 01:19:59.920
She's gone.

01:20:04.852 --> 01:20:06.750
David, what are you doing? Put it down.

01:20:06.752 --> 01:20:08.853
You're gonna get us killed.

01:20:23.918 --> 01:20:26.685
David, stop.

01:20:30.718 --> 01:20:33.352
You don't want to do anything stupid.

01:20:36.318 --> 01:20:37.950
I need you to put that out.

01:20:37.952 --> 01:20:40.251
No.

01:20:41.518 --> 01:20:43.286
I have to destroy it.

01:20:50.518 --> 01:20:53.249
Put it out now.

01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:55.852
Dad?

01:21:03.584 --> 01:21:06.152
- Dad!
- Wait! Stop!

01:21:18.418 --> 01:21:20.218
Crap!

01:21:31.717 --> 01:21:33.682
I won't let you do this.

01:21:33.684 --> 01:21:35.750
You stupid fuck.

01:22:09.617 --> 01:22:13.349
Dad. Come on, Dad.

01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:15.820
Stay inside. Annie!

01:22:27.385 --> 01:22:29.715
I need you to look after her for me.

01:22:29.717 --> 01:22:33.550
Can you do that?

01:22:33.552 --> 01:22:36.217
Get inside, Zach.

01:22:36.219 --> 01:22:38.052
Get inside!

01:22:55.418 --> 01:22:57.653
Dad.

01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:08.949
I'm sorry, Annie. I'm sorry.

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:12.850
I can't go.

01:23:12.852 --> 01:23:16.350
Go where, Dad?

01:23:16.352 --> 01:23:19.285
I love you.

01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:22.515
Dad!

01:23:22.517 --> 01:23:24.250
Dad!

01:23:24.252 --> 01:23:27.216
Annie, it's okay... it's okay.

01:23:27.218 --> 01:23:29.650
It's okay. It's okay.

01:23:32.652 --> 01:23:35.119
What is that?

01:23:38.751 --> 01:23:41.883
David, look at me.

01:23:41.885 --> 01:23:43.850
Open it.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:48.720
I can't... I can't open it.

01:24:18.684 --> 01:24:21.685
Annie. It's okay.

01:24:23.418 --> 01:24:25.785
Come home, David.

01:24:27.552 --> 01:24:29.719
Come home.

01:26:45.585 --> 01:26:52.052
<i>My mother once told me...
nothing bad will ever last.</i>
