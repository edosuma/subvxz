WEBVTT

01:51.177 --> 01:52.811
God, dammit.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.714
How's the plane supposed
to land when it's pitch
black out here?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.850
We're screwed, man.
Shut up!

01:57.852 --> 01:59.418
The boss said
they'd come for us.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.588
We have something
they want.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.557
Huh, tell him
to kiss my ass.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.493
All he cares about
is that bitch!

02:09.797 --> 02:11.363
Now what?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.599
We have to go up there
and turn on the lights?

02:13.601 --> 02:14.766
Get ourselves killed?

02:15.903 --> 02:17.402
Stop! There's
something there.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.452
And
we're coming to you
live from Rio de Janeiro,

03:40.454 --> 03:44.656
<i> it's the official launch of</i>
<i> ocean airlines brand new</i>
<i> luxurious jumbo jet,</i>

03:44.658 --> 03:46.592
it's the a390,

03:46.594 --> 03:48.994
and a string
of cars are coming
in right now.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.464
We got vip
celebrities, and the ceo
of ocean airlines, himself.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.433
Mr. Gary gao.
First of all,

03:54.435 --> 03:56.668
let's have a look at who's
in car number one.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.003
Hello there.
It's so nice of you.

03:58.005 --> 03:58.003
You are looking fabulous.

03:58.005 --> 04:03.609
Now, can you tell
me, are you considering a
merger with ocean airlines,

04:03.611 --> 04:04.910
after the launch today.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.679
Are you a pilot
of ocean airlines...

04:07.681 --> 04:09.314
I'm the co-captain.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.750
And, may I ask,
who are you wearing...

04:11.752 --> 04:13.452
How many on
this maiden flight?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.454
Eight vip's, as
requested, sir.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.988
Each carefully selected.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.857
Beyond the corporate
staff, of course.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.660
This investment,
I'm talking about the
time to modify the aircraft,

04:21.661 --> 04:23.695
from an a380,
to an a390,

04:23.697 --> 04:26.698
plus setting up a
transpacific debut,

04:26.700 --> 04:29.768
as well as a live
broadcast worldwide,

04:29.770 --> 04:32.437
that's cost me over
a 100 million us dollars.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.406
Any mistake...

04:35.508 --> 04:37.309
And this could
be another <i> Titanic.</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:46.018
I want you to make
sure that you take
care of the prince.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.886
It's under control, sir.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.788
I know he's
our golden goose.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.624
In fact, I've even
invited a popular singer

04:52.626 --> 04:54.493
he's quite fond of.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.461
Is that the surprise
you were talking about,

04:56.463 --> 04:57.629
the superstar?

04:57.631 --> 04:57.629
Is he here?

04:57.631 --> 05:02.434
Not yet, but his agent
did confirm with me
again this morning, so...

05:02.436 --> 05:03.669
Let's hope it's not psy.

05:49.982 --> 05:53.752
Distinguished guests,
welcome aboard
our maiden voyage.

05:53.754 --> 05:58.056
Our exclusive,
priority only, a390,
will be taking off shortly.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.360
So, please be seated and
fasten your safety belts.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.761
Good job.
It's great.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.396
It's kind of weird, you know,
making this announcement

06:04.398 --> 06:05.864
to so few people.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.934
Uh, I bet they're a
hundred times harder
to deal with though.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.001
Stop it.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.974
Hey, ruoxin. Ruoxin.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.444
Uh, why don't you
stay here with me and help
out with the guests, okay?

06:19.446 --> 06:21.680
I'm not a flight attendant.

06:21.682 --> 06:25.450
But you are the
prettiest woman we have
in our entire company.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.585
Exactly.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.986
I'm a pilot.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.554
Ruoxin, it's okay.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.723
Xiang.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.091
Please, come on.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.393
Come on!

06:36.696 --> 06:38.930
Where in the world are you?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.500
Most memorable flight
of your lifetime.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.068
I'm ready.
Excuse me.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.580
The headline queen.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.650
It is truly a great
honor for you to
be traveling with us.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.820
I have been one of
your most loyal fans.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.423
But, I guess you're
kind of forced to
follow me.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.992
Seeing as I just
interviewed your
second wife.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.829
Glenda, huh?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.031
She certainly has
been one of your
biggest fans.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.568
Let me give you
the inside scoop.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.503
The reason
for our divorce.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.572
She couldn't cook!

07:20.574 --> 07:22.941
You know, the best way
to a man's heart, is
through his stomach.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.112
Rest assured, Mr. gao,
I'm sure you won't
regret it.

08:04.550 --> 08:04.549
<i> This is</i>
<i> captain Anderson,</i>
<i> on behalf of myself</i>

08:04.551 --> 08:08.587
<i> and the crew, we</i>
<i> welcome you all</i>
<i> aboard this evening</i>

08:08.589 --> 08:08.587
<i> on the new a390.</i>

08:08.589 --> 08:13.725
<i> We'll be leaving the tarmac</i>
<i> in a few minutes so please</i>
<i> relax in your seats...</i>

08:14.794 --> 08:14.793
<i> As we get underway.</i>

08:14.795 --> 08:14.793
<i> From all of us</i>
<i> at ocean airlines,</i>

08:14.795 --> 08:19.197
<i> we thank you for</i>
<i> being part of this</i>
<i> momentous flight.</i>

08:24.270 --> 08:25.971
This plane
is incredible!

08:27.006 --> 08:28.740
I mean suites,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.609
an upstairs restaurant,

08:30.611 --> 08:33.144
and a table lounge,
and bar.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.514
It's like a flying castle.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.216
Hey, they say it
can fly into space.

08:46.058 --> 08:47.526
No, no, no,
sweetheart.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.060
Just all alcohol for me.

08:49.762 --> 08:50.829
Hey!

08:51.264 --> 08:52.764
Mr. rodman!

08:52.766 --> 08:54.533
It's really you!

08:54.535 --> 08:56.601
I love watching you box.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.871
I love watching
your acting.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.043
Yo, my man.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.711
So what
you here for?

09:06.713 --> 09:07.879
Me?

09:07.881 --> 09:07.879
Yeah, you.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.815
You look like one
of those rich guys,

09:10.817 --> 09:12.551
not just somebody
in showbiz.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.752
You must be, rodman?

09:14.687 --> 09:15.921
I'm, khadsa.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.856
Associate chief
of the yan shang group.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.191
Big fan of yours.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.594
All right.
Much respect.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.296
That's ancient
history, right there.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.730
But, you
know what, uh,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.966
it's time for me to
do my own inspection.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.734
Hey, gorgeous.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.636
Why don't you bring me
something a little
stronger to inspect?

09:31.638 --> 09:32.704
Right away.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.943
I'm just going to put
this in a four cabin
for a moment,

09:37.945 --> 09:40.045
and I'll bring it right
back after take-off.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.947
Will there be
enough room?

09:41.949 --> 09:41.947
Oh, yes.

09:41.949 --> 09:46.585
The storage compartment
in this plane is big
enough to fit a grand piano.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.753
I should have
brought one.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.889
You're so sweet.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.894
I saw you play once...

09:55.896 --> 09:58.163
For the New York
philharmonic, Mr. Kim.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.598
Oh, really?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.334
Yes. It was a
summer trip,
15 years ago.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.838
But, I'll honestly
never forget that night.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.274
It will be an
honor to play for
you again, later.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.885
Uh!

10:22.855 --> 10:25.256
The kitchen
is upstairs,
master chef.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.958
I'm so sorry.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
I was looking for
a chili sauce for
my shifu's recipe.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.196
Kelly, said it
might be down here.

10:31.198 --> 10:35.367
I hope your secret sauce
is enough to meet
expectations, tonight.

10:38.938 --> 10:38.937
Okay.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.641
And, it's
time to take off.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.075
Okay, lets see...

10:44.077 --> 10:45.644
This, and this...

10:53.285 --> 10:55.086
Hey, am I late?

10:58.858 --> 11:02.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
our surprise mystery guest,

11:02.428 --> 11:03.928
has arrived.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.964
2020's voice
of the world!

11:06.365 --> 11:07.666
Colin!

11:09.102 --> 11:10.835
Khadsa, my man.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.037
How's it going,
superstar?

11:12.039 --> 11:12.037
Good. How are you doing?

11:12.039 --> 11:16.675
I can never get used
to you wearing all
this golden flashy stuff.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.343
Tell me,
how's living
the big dream?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.678
Can't complain.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.348
You know, I got
everybody to vote for
you on <i> the voice</i> , right?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.416
I knew it.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.184
I knew it was you!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.686
Can I take
your bag?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.387
Thank you.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.956
So, everyone,
i just want to
say thank you,

11:31.958 --> 11:33.825
on behalf of
ocean airlines

11:33.827 --> 11:36.761
on behalf of ocean airlines,
I'd like to welcome all
of you aboard.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.430
We plan to have a
very enjoyable flight.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.698
Cheers!

11:39.700 --> 11:40.799
Cheers!

11:51.444 --> 11:52.711
Peter.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.746
Uh, excuse me.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.182
Yeah.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.050
Surprise, huh?

11:59.885 --> 11:59.884
Yeah.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.721
I found out that they
were roommates at Yale.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.788
Best buddies.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.290
You a smart ass?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.959
He's popular.
Very popular.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.894
Mia, only agreed
to shoot this
because of...

12:09.896 --> 12:09.894
Because of him.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.864
Even that bitch knew
Colin was coming...

12:12.866 --> 12:14.432
And I didn't?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.901
He screws this day up,
i don't want to
ever see you again.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.806
Should be kissing my ass.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.224
Flight check, check.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.359
Okay, with
the radar, check.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.927
Confirm co-ordinates.
Check.

12:43.829 --> 12:44.996
Jason.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.865
Never ask
me to do that.

12:46.867 --> 12:46.865
Ever again.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.235
It just goes to
show how much the
company values you.

12:52.873 --> 12:52.871
So, how are we
looking out there?

12:52.873 --> 12:56.241
Any chance of a live
performance by the
big superstar?

12:56.243 --> 12:58.143
Hm, forget about the show,

12:58.145 --> 13:00.378
Mr. gao, clearly
isn't a fan.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.247
Looks like, Peter,
kissed his ass,

13:02.249 --> 13:03.782
in the wrong place.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.186
Isn't the rich prince
the guy we're
trying to impress?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.855
It should be exactly
what the boss wanted.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.291
Inviting the guy's
old class mate.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.161
Hey, how do you feel
about this a390?

13:16.163 --> 13:19.164
The company says that it
uses magnetic convection.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.801
Enough power to fly
beyond the atmosphere.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.937
You can take over once
we're in the autopilot mode.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.106
You just hand
it back before landing.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.174
Screw you!

13:30.109 --> 13:32.277
Jason only chose
you for this debut

13:32.279 --> 13:33.878
because he thought
you need more training.

13:33.880 --> 13:34.979
Oh. Hm-mm.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.315
Don't get me involved
with this, guys.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.449
Ruoxin,
you're needed.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.884
You cannot go in there.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.119
We are about to
take off right now.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.825
Okay,
pre-flight check.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.198
Ruoxin, you're needed
downstairs after take off.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.300
Oh, and, make sure
you tell the media

13:55.302 --> 13:57.302
that you were once a
flight attendant with us.

13:57.304 --> 13:57.302
Tell them that...

13:57.304 --> 14:01.873
We give everyone at
ocean airlines an
opportunity to grow.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.578
I am not a
flight attendant
any more.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.949
Serving guests isn't
really my responsibility now.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.051
Monica and I,
will be enough.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.620
Yeah, you see,
this isn't any
normal flight.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.857
Even Mr. gao, is
out there serving.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.260
So you will do,
whatever it is, we
need you to do.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.496
Besides...

14:25.498 --> 14:27.131
You're not the
one flying today.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.620
All right, ladies,
ready to serve.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.925
It's my newest dish,
kung pao chicken.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.995
That isn't new at all.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.165
Well...

15:01.167 --> 15:03.167
A thousand different chefs,
will cook a thousand
different kung pao chicken's.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.337
We haven't met.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.405
I'm, chef Mike.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.208
I'm from sichuan.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.911
There's only one
kung pao chicken
in my menu.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.412
Why isn't chef liu, here?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.180
Uh, he had high
blood pressure.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.082
The doctor didn't
allow him on board.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.518
What'd you think?
How does it taste?

15:20.520 --> 15:23.922
You're telling me
a Chinese sichuan chef
sent an American,

15:23.924 --> 15:25.256
to cook sichuan food?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.593
Well, I am his protege.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.529
My shifu just wants to share
sichuan cooking with the world.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.132
Did you know that,
Marco Polo, learned
about spaghetti

15:34.134 --> 15:35.233
from the Chinese people?

15:36.168 --> 15:39.437
Uh, why
are you here?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.506
You should be out
there with our guests.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.175
You should be
on the first floor.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.378
You didn't know
that this chef was
American, did you?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.054
Oh, thank you.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.728
Here you are, sir.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.496
Blackjack!

16:05.498 --> 16:07.265
Thank you,
Mr. rodman,

16:07.267 --> 16:10.068
I haven't been so lucky
since my last Hong Kong
film award.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.737
You should drink more,
my dear best actress.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.672
Luck comes
with good liquor.

16:14.674 --> 16:14.672
Cheers!

16:14.674 --> 16:17.408
You know,<i> lost in</i>
<i> the pacific</i>

16:17.410 --> 16:20.478
is my go-to song
for karaoke,
every time.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.981
Your voice tells
so many stories.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.248
Thank you.
You know what,

16:24.250 --> 16:25.650
I'm sure we have a lot
of time on this flight,

16:25.652 --> 16:26.718
so I can tell
you more stories.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.019
Really?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.988
Thank you.

16:34.059 --> 16:37.128
Your highness,
when we arrive in
Hong Kong tomorrow night,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.497
there'll be plenty of
press waiting for us.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.767
And by next week,
the stock in ocean airlines
will sky rocket.

16:44.269 --> 16:47.105
If that's true,
it's a win-win.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.241
So, you're
on board with our
mergers in acquisition?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.343
So far, I think
it's looking good.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.745
That's wonderful.
Very good.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.430
All right here...

17:12.432 --> 17:15.199
The a390
is the largest plane
in the sky...

17:16.035 --> 17:17.335
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.371
Excuse me,
excuse me,

17:20.373 --> 17:23.174
I'm, Mia ren, with
global news network.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.410
Can I ask you
a few questions?

17:25.412 --> 17:28.546
I'd be fine with that,
but I need to go
to the cockpit now.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.349
She's actually our
co-captain, so it's not
really a great time.

17:31.351 --> 17:35.353
I can arrange a meeting
or an interview for you
later, if you'd like?

17:35.355 --> 17:39.657
Oh! Does ocean airlines
plan to replace all
of it's captains,

17:39.659 --> 17:42.727
with such beauties?
Like luxury airplanes

17:42.729 --> 17:44.295
where they target
the wealthy?

17:52.638 --> 17:53.771
Drink, please.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.842
Hey, bro.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.177
What's going on?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.478
It's been a long time.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.313
What'd you say,
we rack 'em up?

18:02.315 --> 18:03.414
What are we
playing for?

18:04.116 --> 18:06.684
How about this plane?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.686
'Cause it's going
to be yours,
sooner or later.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.656
Please excuse me.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.723
You two have fun.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.698
Sir.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.733
We have a stage two,
code black, emergency.

18:23.702 --> 18:23.701
What is it?

18:23.703 --> 18:28.539
Can you tell me why
the sichuan food is being
cooked by an American?

18:30.509 --> 18:33.144
Yeah, that is
a concern, Peter.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.779
Well, you really
messed up today.
You know that?

18:37.749 --> 18:40.151
Haven't seen him
since he was 18.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.886
You have any idea
what you have done?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.788
Re-uniting me
with this...

18:43.790 --> 18:45.456
Juvenile, at
a critical time.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.159
Wait, he's your son?

18:49.495 --> 18:51.295
Wants to make
a fool out of me.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.132
Your son is
a superstar.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.433
Yeah, I know.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.768
I wanted an heir,
not an entertainer.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.319
How come the storm
sprung up like that?

19:15.321 --> 19:18.222
Weather forecast didn't
say anything about it.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.926
I've never seen
anything so massive.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.895
What did
the control tower say?

19:23.897 --> 19:26.531
This is one of the least
stable areas in the pacific.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.266
Control knows
nothing about the
weather here.

19:29.701 --> 19:30.768
What happened?

19:30.770 --> 19:30.768
Hey, Gary.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.838
We have some pretty
severe weather build
up in the area.

19:34.673 --> 19:34.672
We're gonna need
a new route.

19:34.674 --> 19:40.211
Jason, this is the most
sophisticated commercial
aircraft to date.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.546
You know,
i don't care how
you fly it, but,

19:41.548 --> 19:43.848
you must land my
plane in Hong Kong,
on time.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.751
With weather like this,
we definitely can't
land on time.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.320
For the safety of
the passengers, the
crew, and the plane,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.722
Gary, with the severity
of this weather...

19:51.724 --> 19:54.592
We need to bypass this,
and it's going to take
at least two hours.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.328
Two hours late,
for Hong-Kong?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.397
Well, can you make
up that time?
Can you fly faster?

19:59.399 --> 20:02.200
If this were a
standard airbus, yes, it
wouldn't be a problem, but,

20:02.202 --> 20:04.235
we are in a
converted a390.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.371
It's pretty much a spaceship,
and gulps up fuel, now,

20:07.373 --> 20:09.941
we have enough for
the original route
from rio to Hong-Kong.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.577
The fact that
we need to bypass...

20:12.579 --> 20:14.212
We need to land,
and refuel

20:14.214 --> 20:16.447
no, we're not stopping.
Why don't we keep going.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.716
It will take
at-least three hours

20:18.718 --> 20:22.486
to get to the nearest
alternative airport
in the west pacific.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.288
Never mind
refueling time.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.792
Which would have a
five hour delay for
Hong Kong, minimum.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.694
There's no way
in hell I'm
gonna allow that.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.929
The media's not
gonna wait five hours.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.365
The debut,
the hundred million
dollars that I spent,

20:34.367 --> 20:35.866
the whole thing
will be a big joke.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.735
But, Mr. gao,
we have to.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.304
Thunder storms in the
pacific ocean are no joke.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.773
We've got no choice.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.642
Think about the
lightning, just now.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.710
Ruoxin, please.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.913
Look, you guys
are the best pilots
that I have,

20:48.915 --> 20:48.913
that's why
you're here.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.483
This aircraft
can fly at the
highest altitude,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.719
I don't care!
Just fly above the storm.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.787
Gary, even if we do that,
we still need to refuel.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.756
Just fly through the
damn storm! Will you?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.560
Okay make
an announcement
to the passengers

21:02.562 --> 21:05.363
tell them that the safety
of this aircraft is
completely reliable.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.964
Xiang, check
the wing conditions.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.532
Just keep them down.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.373
Ruoxin, make a
personal announcement
to the passengers.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.874
This is gonna
get bumpy.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.878
Head east.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.350
<i> May I have your</i>
<i> attention please?</i>

21:26.352 --> 21:28.619
<i>This is the co-captain, ruoxin,</i>

21:28.621 --> 21:31.989
<i> our flight will be</i>
<i> experiencing turbulence.</i>

21:31.991 --> 21:33.758
<i> Please return to your seats,</i>

21:33.760 --> 21:36.027
<i>and fasten your safety belts.</i>

21:36.029 --> 21:37.395
<i> Thank you.</i>

21:43.802 --> 21:45.069
Wow. Huh...

21:54.946 --> 21:56.013
Okay.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.326
Oh!

22:09.695 --> 22:09.694
Sorry, Mr. boxer.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.597
I feel a little bit
dizzy and scared.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.333
No. Shh, sh, sh, sh...

22:15.335 --> 22:16.667
Don't worry
about that.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.770
Look, I already have
a nice suite here.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.540
Why don't we go
and explore it?

22:36.121 --> 22:37.722
Why are you still here?

22:37.724 --> 22:40.124
I'm just finishing
my second course of
khow suey chicken,

22:40.126 --> 22:41.492
you wanna try?

22:41.494 --> 22:43.027
Get this mess
cleaned up.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.995
Find yourself a seat,
and buckle in.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.664
Are we landing already?

22:46.666 --> 22:47.832
I'm going to
gather reviews...

22:58.944 --> 23:00.378
How are we doing?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.413
It could be
worse, somewhat.

23:05.617 --> 23:06.884
Height?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.886
Just passed 45,
still climbing.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.954
Increase to 48.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.994
Oh! We're in trouble.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.396
Descend.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.563
Xiang, check on
your perimeters.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.664
Ruoxin, check both wings,

23:20.666 --> 23:21.932
get Gary
in here, asap.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.434
Affirmative.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.122
Mr. gao.

23:45.124 --> 23:45.122
Mr. gao.
Mm-mm?

23:45.124 --> 23:48.426
Something about
an emergency,
please come with me.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.493
Quickly.

24:02.641 --> 24:03.707
Bob.

24:03.709 --> 24:04.942
Bob.

24:13.652 --> 24:14.718
What is happening?

24:14.720 --> 24:14.718
Flood her again!

24:14.720 --> 24:18.923
We have to shut
the port engine down
and land the plane.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.124
Lightning strike
on port engine!

24:20.126 --> 24:21.725
Firm alarm has
been activated!

24:21.727 --> 24:23.127
The engine is on fire?

24:23.129 --> 24:25.629
I checked, haven't seen
anything, no flames.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.231
But the
alarm's still on.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.700
Auto fire detection
system's cycled twice

24:29.702 --> 24:29.700
and the light's still on.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.903
It might have
short circuited the
fire engine system

24:32.905 --> 24:35.473
and this is a false alarm,
but we're at risk
of combustion.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.576
We have to prep
for landing and have
a look at this plane.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.677
She's right.

24:39.679 --> 24:39.677
Where's the
nearest airport?

24:39.679 --> 24:43.180
Sorman islands,
two hours outside
the storm zone.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.682
Which enables
us to bypass.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.183
That's too far.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.885
There's got to be
a landing field, or
something closer.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.153
Mr. gao, we can't
keep risking it!

24:58.129 --> 25:00.731
All right, the
lay over inspection,
is approved.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.900
But we have to hurry.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.835
We can't be late for
the live broadcast.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.538
The only other
option we have is in
an abandoned airport at...

25:07.540 --> 25:10.074
Fortune island,
it reads at 30
nautical miles.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.977
We're gonna land there,
we're gonna inspect the plane,
and then we're moving on.

25:12.979 --> 25:17.147
It's very dangerous
to land at an abandoned
airport at midnight.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.782
There's low visibility.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.518
There are rumors
about that island.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.720
Some kind of
supernatural monster.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.689
Nobody lives there now,
even the military pulled out.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.825
Elite pilots, please
don't tell me you're
afraid of the darkness

25:27.827 --> 25:29.126
and some
crazy fairy tale.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.028
It's not a fairytale.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.998
Eight years ago,
one of our flights
was attacked while

25:34.000 --> 25:36.100
trying to depart
from this island.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.969
Yeah, but there's
no concrete evidence
from that investigation.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.739
No one knows what
the real cause of
the damage was.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.607
Come on, Jason,
put this thing on the
ground, will you.

25:45.176 --> 25:47.211
It's a go I guess
for fortune island.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.780
Ruoxin, prepare
passengers and cabin
crew for landing.

25:52.017 --> 25:54.118
Sir, is everything okay?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.153
Tell everyone
we gotta land.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.655
Landing?
Yeah.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.823
For what?
Just shut up and listen!

25:59.825 --> 26:01.959
Just say, we have
a little surprise.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.193
That's all you
got to say, okay.

26:13.638 --> 26:14.905
Everyone...

26:16.308 --> 26:19.243
We planned a
special experience
for all of you.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.679
A short stop
at pacific island.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.949
We hope
fortune island will
bring you luck.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.685
A pristine
tropical island.

26:27.687 --> 26:28.786
So romantic.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.989
And what if we
don't want to go?

26:37.262 --> 26:39.096
Thanks for checking
in control.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.332
Everything is all right,
we're just re-routing
an inter bypass for

26:41.334 --> 26:44.702
thunderstorms
in the area.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.805
So, it'll be about a one
hour delay before we
change next signal point.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.873
Possible radar loss,
due to weather.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.176
Affirm.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.243
Good job, captain.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.679
This is reckless.

26:55.681 --> 26:58.148
We're violating countless
aviation regulations.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.318
Xiang...

27:01.320 --> 27:02.820
Xiang, shut down
the transponder.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.364
This is way more
exciting than I pictured.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.067
It feels like
we're on Mars.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.802
I'm gonna go
check the engines.

27:52.737 --> 27:53.904
Xiang,
you stay here.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.272
I'll go with you.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.807
Me too.

27:56.809 --> 27:57.975
Xiang, stay.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.877
Just in case.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.248
Ruoxin,
prepare emergency hatch.

28:16.895 --> 28:17.961
All right.

28:22.734 --> 28:23.967
So exciting.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.936
Are we getting off?

28:25.938 --> 28:29.239
I'm so sorry, but, uh,
on this island there are...

28:29.241 --> 28:32.876
A lot of nocturnal animals,
and it's not safe to get out.

28:32.878 --> 28:36.380
However, you can take
as many photographs
as you'd like,

28:36.382 --> 28:38.282
from right here
inside the plane.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.285
No signal!

28:41.287 --> 28:44.755
What's the point of being
anywhere if you can't even
post selfies in front of it.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.957
So boring.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.992
Yay, this is so cool.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.095
What a beautiful island.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.205
So, what's your
lie of the day?

29:01.207 --> 29:02.272
Why are we
really here?

29:02.274 --> 29:03.874
Don't mess this up.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.242
I'm still your father.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.343
Father?

29:06.345 --> 29:08.178
Did you just call
yourself my father?

29:08.180 --> 29:09.313
Really?

29:09.315 --> 29:09.313
You left when
i was a kid.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.983
You sent me off
to boarding schools.
You never cared!

29:12.985 --> 29:14.418
You didn't even
come see me.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.853
And you know what?

29:15.855 --> 29:15.853
You pretty much
killed mom.

29:15.855 --> 29:21.391
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are pleased to introduce
you to, chef Mike.

29:21.393 --> 29:25.028
Who's actually the
last apprentice, under the
master of sichuan cuisine,

29:25.030 --> 29:26.530
chef liu.

29:26.532 --> 29:29.199
He's also a very special
guest of ours today, so,

29:29.201 --> 29:31.168
we invite you to
go on upstairs,

29:31.170 --> 29:34.772
and enjoy some
of his very special,
sichuan cuisine.

29:35.373 --> 29:37.074
Peter...

29:37.076 --> 29:39.209
Listen, I'm going
outside for pictures.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.911
Come grab me when
we take off, okay.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.246
No, no, no.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.815
I'm sorry, no one's going
outside the plane. No.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.817
Come on, I'm a vip.

29:46.819 --> 29:47.951
Can I help you,
miss ren?

29:49.287 --> 29:51.255
Problem solved, Mr. gao.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.322
What problem?

29:52.957 --> 29:54.191
Don't play dumb.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.193
I know we forced the
landing on this island.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.529
What do you want?

29:58.531 --> 30:01.031
Footage,
outside the plane.

30:01.033 --> 30:04.368
This is fortune
island after all.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.870
And if I refuse,
you're gonna slander
us in the press,

30:06.872 --> 30:07.938
is that it?

30:07.940 --> 30:09.506
You got it.
Come on.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.215
Go with them.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.449
No one leaves the tarmac.

30:28.226 --> 30:31.094
Stay close,
we're taking off soon.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.496
<i> There are</i>
<i> monsters on the island.</i>

30:32.498 --> 30:34.164
<i> You sure you don't</i>
<i> wanna come?</i>

30:35.133 --> 30:36.433
I'd rather stay here.

30:47.045 --> 30:49.580
Xiang, can you run
some diagnostics on
the engine please,

30:49.582 --> 30:51.915
I'm seeing some scorch
marks here, but...

30:51.917 --> 30:53.350
No internal damage.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.021
All right, what does it say?

31:00.024 --> 31:03.227
Oh, it's here.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.863
All right, it looks like both
engines are fully functional.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.097
We got to go.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.999
Something's wrong
with this place.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.135
Hey, can we leave?

31:12.137 --> 31:13.871
Yes, we will
take off soon.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.641
Xiang, can you prepare
the cockpit for departure?

31:19.378 --> 31:20.911
You gotta be kidding me.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.533
Arrgh!

32:03.187 --> 32:04.388
Who let them out?

32:04.390 --> 32:06.156
I can guess who.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.058
Just help me get
them back, hurry up!

32:12.130 --> 32:13.597
Come back.
We are leaving.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.242
It's an honor for
me to be here tonight.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.312
I've been passionate
about Chinese food
for a very long time.

32:28.314 --> 32:31.248
And, I was lucky enough
to become, chef liu's
apprentice, last year.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.350
Please, enjoy.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.991
As a lady from Hong Kong,
I'd say it's great.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.695
I'm not from sichuan, but
speaking as an Arabian,

32:45.196 --> 32:46.730
I love it!

32:46.732 --> 32:50.300
Our new generation
of sichuan chefs.

32:50.302 --> 32:55.005
Ocean airlines is offering
sichuan cuisine on all
international flights

32:55.007 --> 32:56.473
out of Hong Kong,
next month.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.608
What's going on?
Something wrong
with the plane?

32:59.377 --> 32:59.376
I don't know,but,

32:59.378 --> 33:02.612
I think Mia ren found
something interesting
to shoot.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.148
Ahem.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.651
It's said fortune island
had been taken over
by military, but,

33:07.653 --> 33:10.053
there are no signs
of such a presence now.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.206
Bob.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.027
Kelly, get me
to the ground.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.728
Mr. gao, get the plane
ready for take off.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.598
You see that!
This is what you call
your vip experience!

33:54.600 --> 33:57.200
Monica, get everyone
downstairs and ready
for take off!

33:57.202 --> 33:58.635
What's going on?
Excuse me, please.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.644
Xiang, take off right now!

34:08.679 --> 34:10.414
Jason, Peter!

34:10.416 --> 34:12.049
Close the hatch, now!

34:12.051 --> 34:14.284
Get us started, hurry!

34:16.286 --> 34:17.621
Take off, Jason.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.456
Jason!

34:19.458 --> 34:20.724
Jason, hurry up!

34:34.338 --> 34:35.739
Jason... Jason...

34:45.116 --> 34:46.349
Captain!

34:46.351 --> 34:48.118
Captain,
we're taking off!

34:52.489 --> 34:53.723
Let's go.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.165
Close the hatch,
right now!

35:02.167 --> 35:03.700
We still got people
down there, asshole!

35:04.802 --> 35:05.869
Stay down, Peter.

35:16.414 --> 35:18.815
Come on, come on.
I got you.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.277
We're running
out of bullets,
let us on!

35:47.279 --> 35:48.678
Let them on.
They saved us.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.448
You just watch them.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.350
Trust me,
it will be fine.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.552
Okay.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.689
So, the rumors are true.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.491
I told them to stay inside.
Forget it.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.359
What's going on?

36:38.329 --> 36:40.664
Yeah, what's you guys story?

36:40.666 --> 36:43.433
Well, first of all we're
all kind of embarrassed,

36:43.435 --> 36:44.968
about how we must look.

36:44.970 --> 36:48.238
We've been held up
in a warehouse for
the last two weeks.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.806
No rescue,
no one showed up.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.909
But it's surprising
to see a commercial
aircraft land there.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.911
My name is lieutenant,
Vincent riggs,

36:54.913 --> 36:56.913
and this is,
sergeant Nikki Lee.

36:56.915 --> 37:00.217
We are members of
a joint task force
assembled by the u.N,

37:00.219 --> 37:02.719
sent to fortune island
on a blockade mission.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.621
And we thought it
would be an easy
in and out,

37:04.623 --> 37:06.590
until we ran into
those creatures.

37:06.592 --> 37:06.590
They're just
too many of them.

37:06.592 --> 37:11.628
And when we arrived,
the island was already
out of control.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.863
So, for two weeks
we fought hard,

37:13.865 --> 37:16.333
until we were
the only survivors.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.335
And we had
given up hope...

37:18.337 --> 37:19.736
And you guys
came along.

37:23.307 --> 37:24.874
I'm sorry to hear
about your men.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.376
But, thank you so
much for saving us.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.545
Of course.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.447
It's been a...

37:30.449 --> 37:32.349
Such a thrilling
trip, Mr. gao.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.619
Now who's
in charge of your show?

37:35.621 --> 37:37.420
I am. Gary gao.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.957
President, and ceo,
of ocean airlines.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.659
Thanks for having
us aboard, Mr. gao.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.427
My pleasure, I'm
glad I could be of help.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to extend my
most Sincere apologies

37:49.635 --> 37:50.967
for the recent accidents.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.902
We've contacted
authorities in
Hong Kong, and,

37:52.904 --> 37:54.838
when we land they'll
be taking over.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.972
Accident?

37:55.974 --> 37:57.641
Are you out of your mind?

37:57.643 --> 38:00.477
Two of our men just died.

38:00.479 --> 38:04.514
In his eyes,
stock market prices
are way more important

38:04.516 --> 38:05.615
than human lives.

38:06.817 --> 38:08.885
You ungrateful
little brat.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.354
Who's been spending
a small fortune on
you, his entire life?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.659
So, are you
publicly admitting
that I'm your son?

38:15.661 --> 38:16.793
Yeah.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.728
Wow! Okay...

38:18.730 --> 38:21.364
So, I'm going to publicly
admit that this is my
self-centered father!

38:21.366 --> 38:22.565
That's my son.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.468
I see now!

38:25.470 --> 38:26.970
You have totally
got his nose.

38:26.972 --> 38:26.970
What!

38:26.972 --> 38:30.740
So, you planned all this
just so that I would invest?

38:30.742 --> 38:32.609
No, prince, that
was never my plan.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.344
I haven't seen my
son in five years.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.346
Not since i
divorced his mother.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.682
And you know what,
you never showed up
to her funeral.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.620
Kelly, uh...

38:43.622 --> 38:45.722
Bring everyone upstairs,
make sure they're comfortable.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.825
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.927
our next destination
is Hong Kong.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.595
I could use
a cup of tea.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.397
Please try to enjoy
the rest of your flight.

38:54.399 --> 38:57.000
I'm fed up with
this special experience.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.869
I'm going to get some sleep
before landing in Hong Kong.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.938
Just like rodman,
the clever man.

39:10.581 --> 39:11.748
Chef.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.882
Shouldn't you
have gone upstairs?

39:12.884 --> 39:12.882
I mean you
don't wanna...

39:12.884 --> 39:16.419
Stick around for the rest
of this family drama, do you?

39:17.054 --> 39:18.588
Are you my boss now?

39:19.925 --> 39:20.990
Didn't think so.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.066
I'm sorry.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.068
Yeah.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.371
Going down for pictures,
and now two people are dead.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.508
You couldn't call
headquarters
for back up?

39:38.510 --> 39:40.510
Our coms
were down.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.811
What were you
using for relay?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.012
Satellite equipment.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.614
It was damaged
during the fight.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.750
The creatures destroyed
everything in the airport.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.787
All we could do
was wait for rescue.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.722
But you're not really
trusting us, are you, chef?

39:53.858 --> 39:55.859
That's okay, he
used to be military.

39:58.028 --> 40:00.063
Ex-soldier?
No wonder.

40:01.799 --> 40:03.466
So you're not a cook?

40:04.602 --> 40:06.936
Uh, I'm actually
just a cook now.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.539
Um, I retired
a long time ago.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.875
It's just that I can't
trust someone who
keeps their...

40:11.877 --> 40:12.942
Finger on the trigger.

40:17.047 --> 40:18.515
It's all right.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.583
You have every reason
not to trust us.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.819
But this documentation
will prove that we belong

40:22.821 --> 40:25.455
to the united nations,
biological crisis team.

40:40.671 --> 40:44.107
The communication equipment
was damaged during the
last take off.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.208
What?

40:47.077 --> 40:49.012
It seems we have
no choice but to
trust each other.

40:49.680 --> 40:49.679
That been said,

40:49.681 --> 40:53.550
we need to reach
these coordinates as
soon as possible.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.689
About 500 nautical
miles from here.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.791
Oh, it's our,
headquarters.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.061
A transit airport under
the ocean offering supplies,

41:05.063 --> 41:06.763
repairs... anything
you would need.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.798
That's not necessary,
we can make it to
Hong Kong.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.701
I'm afraid not, Mr. gao,
not in this storm.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.736
Well, this flight cannot
afford any further delays.

41:13.738 --> 41:16.639
It's not up to you,
I'm afraid.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.576
The coordinates
are right in the middle
of a dangerous area.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.678
A Bermuda triangle of sorts.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.480
Ships get lost there
all the time.

41:23.482 --> 41:24.881
It's on the regular route.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.716
I guess I need to
make myself clear.

41:26.718 --> 41:30.820
Our incident has
forced this flight
into a state of emergency.

41:30.822 --> 41:34.123
For everyone's
safety, the u.N will take
control of the flight.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.658
Is that understood?

41:36.093 --> 41:37.827
A take over?

41:37.829 --> 41:37.827
That's not up to you.

41:37.829 --> 41:42.131
The u.N inspects
and supplies civilian
flights now, does it?

41:43.067 --> 41:44.701
In all honesty,
veteran...

41:44.703 --> 41:46.269
It's a secret base.

41:46.271 --> 41:48.538
Those creatures you
saw were mutated cats.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.507
The intel on
them is top secret.

41:50.509 --> 41:50.507
So, to avoid
global panic...

41:50.509 --> 41:55.545
The authorities set up
base on fortune island
as containment...

41:55.547 --> 41:55.545
To prevent it
from getting worse.

41:55.547 --> 42:00.283
So, we appreciate your
cooperation in getting
us to our headquarters

42:00.285 --> 42:02.151
as soon as possible.

42:02.153 --> 42:05.088
Oh, basically you're
saying that we need to
get brainwashed because

42:05.090 --> 42:07.190
we saw the mutant cats?

42:07.192 --> 42:08.958
Are the men in black,
there waiting for us?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.760
It doesn't matter.
I'm against it.

42:10.762 --> 42:13.296
Look, it's just some
weird ass creature
on a primitive island.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.931
But, it's hardly
a global disaster.

42:16.767 --> 42:18.535
They saved us.
Those two.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.604
I trust them.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.106
And the only thing you
should be worried about,

42:23.108 --> 42:23.106
is the safety of
your own passengers.

42:23.108 --> 42:27.143
I am concerned
about the passengers, and
we should land at Hong Kong.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.678
They did save us.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.214
And we know how
terrifying those
monsters were.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.916
We should cooperate.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.984
Are you out of
your mind, ruoxin!

42:34.986 --> 42:36.553
You still want to work
with ocean airlines!

42:37.288 --> 42:39.088
First and foremost,

42:39.090 --> 42:40.757
I am the captain.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.226
Jason's gone.

42:43.228 --> 42:46.229
We violated aviation
regulations anyway.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.064
We are running
out of fuel.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.333
It's too risky to fly
through the storm.

42:50.335 --> 42:52.268
You have such a
clear mind, captain.

42:54.872 --> 42:56.005
That's it.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.007
I have final say as captain.

43:01.979 --> 43:04.647
Ruoxin, look, look,
it's not that simple.

43:04.649 --> 43:07.216
Whoever you are,
i have made up my mind.

43:07.218 --> 43:09.919
Okay, the communication
equipment was destroyed
on purpose.

43:09.921 --> 43:09.919
Not during that fight.

43:09.921 --> 43:13.323
The antennas were on top
of the plane, the creatures
were on the ground.

43:14.224 --> 43:15.725
Listen...

43:15.727 --> 43:17.994
You're skilled,
and you're brave...

43:17.996 --> 43:21.064
But how can you tell
whether it was on
purpose, or not?

43:21.066 --> 43:22.966
Because I led a specialized
counter terrorism unit.

43:22.968 --> 43:25.001
Knocking out comms
was an everyday thing.

43:25.003 --> 43:26.903
How do you prove
any of that?

43:26.905 --> 43:28.771
All I see now is a cook,

43:28.773 --> 43:30.907
who makes terrible
sichuan food.

43:30.909 --> 43:33.009
Look, we are
in big trouble...

43:34.278 --> 43:36.813
I need you to keep
everyone safe.

43:36.815 --> 43:37.981
No more mistakes.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.248
Do you understand?

43:39.250 --> 43:40.617
I understand.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.018
Just... let me help you.

43:43.988 --> 43:46.756
Not only is the
communication equipment
damaged...

43:47.625 --> 43:49.292
We are running
out of fuel.

43:49.294 --> 43:49.292
It's suicide,

43:49.294 --> 43:53.696
if we keep our route
to fly through the storm.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.698
The co-ordinates has
given us a chance.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.266
We've got to try.

43:58.035 --> 43:59.102
Okay.

44:01.171 --> 44:04.007
Air safety is
my main concern.

44:04.009 --> 44:06.809
There's no better place
to land within two hours.

44:08.679 --> 44:09.946
We have no choice.

44:12.416 --> 44:13.750
No more casualties.

44:15.285 --> 44:16.853
I understand.

44:16.855 --> 44:17.920
Trust me.

44:18.689 --> 44:20.023
I respect your decision.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.193
We'll have
a safe landing.

46:02.459 --> 46:04.794
Why don't you head upstairs
and relax over there?

46:06.964 --> 46:08.231
I'll go with you.

46:12.836 --> 46:13.936
Me too.

46:30.021 --> 46:31.120
You spying on me?

46:33.557 --> 46:35.424
Shouldn't make an innocent
man feel uncomfortable.

46:47.838 --> 46:50.106
Your highness,
looks like you're
enjoying your tea.

46:51.408 --> 46:54.243
I do hope our little setback
just now won't influence

46:54.245 --> 46:56.112
your assessment
of oceanic airlines?

46:56.480 --> 46:58.381
Mr. gao...

46:58.383 --> 47:01.918
The unexpected circumstances
have proved too much.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.055
To be honest, a
reassessment is necessary.

47:11.862 --> 47:13.329
For you're
own safety, okay?

47:15.999 --> 47:18.000
What do you want?
Only to chat.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.235
Just curious...

47:19.237 --> 47:20.303
What are you looking at?

47:23.106 --> 47:24.907
It's none
of your business.

47:24.909 --> 47:26.175
Can I ask you
a question?

47:26.177 --> 47:28.878
What's a beauty like you
doing playing with guns?

47:28.880 --> 47:31.380
I'm sorry,
i forgot to introduce
the both of you.

47:31.382 --> 47:32.949
Prince khadsa.

47:32.951 --> 47:35.885
Associate chief,
of the yan shang group.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.353
Not every man
is born rich.

47:45.329 --> 47:46.529
Your highness has...

47:47.231 --> 47:48.464
Unique taste.

47:51.235 --> 47:52.535
I gotta ask...

47:52.537 --> 47:54.170
Why become a
chef after retiring?

47:55.906 --> 47:57.406
Creation is better
than destruction.

47:58.575 --> 47:59.942
Don't you think?

48:04.448 --> 48:06.048
I've haven't
thought about it.

48:13.590 --> 48:16.893
Mike, Mr. gao would
like to see you upstairs
for the next meal.

48:16.895 --> 48:17.960
Okay.

48:21.331 --> 48:23.299
That's right, time to go
cook something good.

48:24.134 --> 48:25.201
Gorgeous!

48:26.603 --> 48:28.537
Do you have
anything to drink?

48:28.539 --> 48:30.273
Anything. What
would you like?

48:31.008 --> 48:32.241
Jameson.

48:59.136 --> 49:01.604
I'm sick and
tired of cave exploration.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.239
I'm sick and
tired of fighting
those monsters.

49:03.241 --> 49:03.239
And I'm sick
and tired of

49:03.241 --> 49:06.142
pretending to be
some sort of u.N force.

49:06.144 --> 49:08.377
Listen, major,
you're gonna have to
play ball a little longer.

49:08.379 --> 49:12.048
It's only because
of these people that
we got off that island.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.482
They're
already suspicious.

49:13.484 --> 49:15.451
Once we reach these
coordinates, they're
gonna find out.

49:15.453 --> 49:16.986
Calm down.

49:16.988 --> 49:18.254
Now, we got this sample...

49:18.256 --> 49:21.357
Now all we gotta do is
sell it to the buyer.

49:21.359 --> 49:22.992
If that chef gets
in our way...

49:22.994 --> 49:24.327
I will
take care of it.

49:24.329 --> 49:25.962
You promised,
no more killing.

49:25.964 --> 49:28.130
Yes, but I also
promised large amounts of money.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.099
Enough money to
take your little boy,

49:30.101 --> 49:31.167
and live happily...

49:31.169 --> 49:32.335
This has nothing to
do with my son!

49:32.337 --> 49:34.470
This has everything
to do with your son!

49:34.472 --> 49:36.405
You are
here because of him.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.207
Not because of me.

49:39.309 --> 49:40.443
So, you are listening.

49:40.445 --> 49:41.510
Good.

49:42.379 --> 49:44.580
This...
This right here,

49:44.582 --> 49:47.016
we have to sell
this at any cost.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.150
This...

49:53.657 --> 49:55.358
The weather
getting any better?

49:57.728 --> 49:59.028
No.

49:59.030 --> 50:00.629
But we are flying low.

50:00.631 --> 50:02.365
Keeping clear
of the storm ceiling.

50:03.767 --> 50:06.602
We had to change
direction to avoid
the center of the storm.

50:08.438 --> 50:10.373
I invested to
train you as a pilot,

50:10.375 --> 50:12.475
and you're
disobeying orders.

50:12.477 --> 50:14.076
Is that how Jason
trained you?

50:14.078 --> 50:15.578
Jason?

50:15.580 --> 50:19.048
Jason told me to do
what a captain should.

50:19.050 --> 50:22.351
But it's a damn shame
he couldn't tell you himself.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.720
It's your decision
that got him killed.

50:24.722 --> 50:28.157
I am not gonna
repeat his mistake.

50:30.093 --> 50:32.261
It seems you don't
want to pilot my
planes in the future.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.329
That's fine.

50:33.331 --> 50:35.097
What I want to do...

50:35.099 --> 50:37.333
Is make sure we have
a future, Mr. gao.

50:37.335 --> 50:38.734
She's dead!

50:38.736 --> 50:40.136
Lily young, she's dead.

50:53.083 --> 50:54.583
Who found her?

50:54.585 --> 50:56.285
She died so horrible.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.420
So tragically.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.825
Vincent is
already in there.

51:02.827 --> 51:04.093
Everyone just stay calm.

51:04.095 --> 51:05.294
I'm going in.

51:06.263 --> 51:07.797
What are you doing?

51:07.799 --> 51:10.232
I'm the captain,
i have the right to
deal with any threat.

51:10.234 --> 51:13.335
I suggest we don't
irritate them right now.

51:13.337 --> 51:15.838
Captain, the situation
is under control.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.206
We may have to co

51:17.208 --> 51:18.607
oh, oh...

51:18.609 --> 51:20.142
This where
the party at...

51:21.212 --> 51:22.411
Who are you?

51:23.280 --> 51:25.247
I love your beard, man!

51:26.850 --> 51:28.250
Mr. rodman...

51:28.252 --> 51:31.387
I'm afraid I have
to ask you a question.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.557
There are reports saying
you have difficulties
controlling your emotions,

51:34.559 --> 51:37.093
when you're not sober...

51:37.095 --> 51:40.563
Hold on, look, those
paparazzi hopped my fence.

51:40.565 --> 51:41.831
What do you mean
I'm violent?

51:42.566 --> 51:44.233
There is an emergency,

51:44.235 --> 51:47.670
and as captain I'm
obliged to investigate.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.772
Oh, wait,
investigate what?

51:51.108 --> 51:52.241
Yo, what happened!

51:52.243 --> 51:54.477
We can't disturb
the body right now.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.547
Now, when we land...

51:58.549 --> 52:01.383
The military police will
board the plane and
handle it from there.

52:01.385 --> 52:02.485
And that will be in...

52:03.120 --> 52:04.220
Half an hour.

52:04.222 --> 52:06.288
Good. Half an hour.

52:06.290 --> 52:09.158
Captain, if you could
please show your passengers,

52:09.160 --> 52:11.293
to the first class cabin,
have them take a seat.

52:26.710 --> 52:27.810
Hey, ren,

52:28.912 --> 52:30.212
what did you see?

52:31.515 --> 52:34.383
She's covered with
blood all over.

52:41.291 --> 52:43.692
I cannot
disagree with you more.

52:43.694 --> 52:45.661
I think we're in
for a lot of trouble.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.730
He's not who
he says he is.

52:47.732 --> 52:49.398
It's totally suspicious.

52:49.400 --> 52:50.599
What do you
want me to do?

52:50.601 --> 52:52.234
Doesn't this all
seem a little sketchy?

52:52.236 --> 52:53.569
That's what
I'm saying.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.905
The only way right
now is to land asap.

52:55.907 --> 52:57.873
So the authorities
can take over.

52:57.875 --> 53:01.443
Look, captain,
i think we should
still land in Hong Kong.

53:01.445 --> 53:04.246
Who knows what a welcome
party the so called base
would be like.

53:04.248 --> 53:04.246
We need to land
in Hong Kong.

53:04.248 --> 53:08.884
At least the Hong Kong
military police and ocean
airlines can co-operate.

53:10.253 --> 53:11.387
Peter!

53:11.922 --> 53:13.222
Where's Peter?

53:13.224 --> 53:13.222
Kelly.

53:13.224 --> 53:15.858
Go find Peter, tell him
i want to speak to him.

53:19.296 --> 53:20.563
Wait, ruoxin.

53:22.399 --> 53:23.732
What now?

53:23.734 --> 53:26.368
You know we can't go where
they want us to, right?

53:26.370 --> 53:27.803
Then you
tell me where.

53:27.805 --> 53:30.306
How about a crash
landing at sea?

53:31.374 --> 53:33.609
You don't think my
suspicions are grounded?

53:33.611 --> 53:35.711
Uh, we just lost
another person.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.913
That document
could be forged.

53:37.915 --> 53:40.783
They just barricaded a
crime scene, and gao's
assistant is missing.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.453
These guys
are hijackers.

53:44.455 --> 53:46.922
Have you got
sufficient proof?

53:46.924 --> 53:49.725
Even if it's true,
what can we do?

53:49.727 --> 53:52.661
Fight unarmed,
against two
carrying hijackers?

54:50.854 --> 54:52.955
Hey, except for the room
where we found Lily's body,

54:52.957 --> 54:54.356
I've looked everywhere.

54:54.358 --> 54:55.424
I can't find him anywhere.

54:55.426 --> 54:55.424
Well, the plane's
only so big,

54:55.426 --> 54:58.961
how can a walking,talking,
human being, just vanish?

54:58.963 --> 55:00.562
If even if he is
walking and talking,

55:00.564 --> 55:02.498
I think it's safe
to say he's
in big trouble.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.467
Looks like Mr. chef's
becoming a pessimist.

55:05.469 --> 55:07.770
We were just
attacked by some
supernatural cats.

55:07.772 --> 55:09.905
Optimism is out the
window at this point.

55:09.907 --> 55:11.840
You sure there's
anywhere else you
haven't looked?

55:11.842 --> 55:15.544
I've checked every room,
every corner, unless...

55:16.646 --> 55:18.080
Oh, my god. It can't be.

55:36.533 --> 55:37.766
Aagh!

55:39.402 --> 55:40.936
Anyone
want a cellphone?

55:40.938 --> 55:43.038
It's one of those
new hi-tech models.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.673
We got to tell
the others.

55:46.410 --> 55:48.077
You like meddling
in other people's
business, don't you?

55:48.079 --> 55:50.579
Not really, what a good
chef should be doing?

55:50.581 --> 55:52.481
Guess I was right
about you.

55:52.483 --> 55:54.116
We'll be landing soon.

55:54.118 --> 55:55.651
Try and behave until then.

56:31.087 --> 56:33.555
I know why you
quit the military.

56:33.557 --> 56:36.425
Because you can't kill.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.594
Now get up.

56:39.095 --> 56:40.462
Get up!

56:46.569 --> 56:47.770
Move.

56:52.642 --> 56:54.176
Move to the
front of the cabin.

56:56.846 --> 56:59.615
Everybody, sit tight!

56:59.617 --> 57:01.116
We'll be landing soon.

57:06.656 --> 57:09.491
How come there's
only one hostess here,
where are the rest?

57:09.493 --> 57:11.827
Everybody here is safe,
except for in the cockpit.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.762
Mr. gao, where
is the rest
of your crew?

57:13.764 --> 57:13.762
I don't, they...

57:13.764 --> 57:17.599
When I went to
find Peter, I sent the
whole cabin crew down

57:17.601 --> 57:18.801
to cargo to look for him.

57:21.004 --> 57:22.171
Bring them up.

57:30.480 --> 57:31.580
What's going on?

57:31.582 --> 57:33.582
They're
hijacking the plane.

57:33.584 --> 57:36.652
He killed Peter,
probably, Lily young too.

57:36.654 --> 57:38.554
Where exactly
are you taking us?

57:38.556 --> 57:40.656
You've already tested
my Patience once.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.025
And I've got enough
bullets in this gun for you,

57:43.027 --> 57:44.693
and everyone
else on this plane.

57:45.962 --> 57:47.896
You better hope
all those bullets
hit the bone,

57:47.898 --> 57:50.699
because if you punch
a hole in this plane,
we're all dead.

57:50.701 --> 57:51.767
Wait, wait!

57:52.735 --> 57:54.203
What do you really want?

57:54.205 --> 57:55.737
I told you.

57:55.739 --> 57:57.739
My headquarters!

57:57.741 --> 58:01.176
And if we don't land as
planned, I'll start
executing hostages,

58:01.178 --> 58:02.945
starting with Mr. chef,

58:02.947 --> 58:04.646
as I've grown to
like him the least.

58:05.915 --> 58:08.684
You need me,
to land this plane.

58:08.686 --> 58:12.654
I promise that won't happen
if you hurt anyone else.

58:12.656 --> 58:14.723
Whoa, whoa.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.492
Whatever your rush
is to land this plane,

58:16.494 --> 58:18.060
killing the captain
is not a good start.

58:19.596 --> 58:21.997
I know
you're right,
Mr. chef.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.666
I'll make you
a deal, captain.

58:24.668 --> 58:28.036
Everyone's safety for
the promise that i
get to go where I

58:28.038 --> 58:29.605
need to go!

58:32.009 --> 58:33.642
Monica, Monica.

58:37.046 --> 58:38.247
Sit here.

58:39.849 --> 58:41.583
Give her water.

58:41.585 --> 58:42.918
Make her drink
as much as she can,
and don't let her stop.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.620
Those wounds
are full of poison.

58:44.622 --> 58:45.854
Okay, here.

58:48.591 --> 58:49.925
What's all this?

58:49.927 --> 58:51.560
The creatures
made it on the plane.

58:51.562 --> 58:52.861
And they knew about it.

58:52.863 --> 58:54.630
That's how Lily died.

58:54.632 --> 58:56.031
She's the only
one still alive.

58:56.033 --> 58:58.000
The rest of them
should be like
Lily young.

58:58.002 --> 58:59.601
One of those creatures
are down there.

58:59.603 --> 59:01.136
I've already
sealed off
the corridors.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.237
You got them killed.

59:03.006 --> 59:04.640
You should have warned us.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.742
Now we have
to land, captain.

59:06.744 --> 59:09.545
If we don't, this
creature will kill
everyone on this plane,

59:09.547 --> 59:11.013
one after another.

59:11.015 --> 59:14.082
And we can't
fight them in
a metal bucket.

59:14.084 --> 59:15.918
Within the confines
of this plane,

59:15.920 --> 59:17.185
one of them will
kill all of us.

59:17.187 --> 59:18.820
They're just too fast.

59:18.822 --> 59:21.223
So you're using
my people to
feed them until we land?

59:21.225 --> 59:24.026
They're nocturnal,
sensitive to light.

59:24.028 --> 59:26.328
But, if they can adjust to
the brightness of this cabin,

59:26.330 --> 59:27.996
they'll come after us.

59:27.998 --> 59:30.165
We have to go
upstairs, all of us.

59:30.167 --> 59:32.568
The lounge is more
lit up than anywhere else.

59:32.570 --> 59:34.937
All right, we can barricade
the stairs in the corridor.

59:43.212 --> 59:45.113
We can't wait for that.

59:45.115 --> 59:47.115
It's not long
till we land.

59:47.117 --> 59:49.051
Take me to
the cockpit, captain.

59:49.652 --> 59:51.820
Watch everyone.

59:51.822 --> 59:54.823
Come on, Mike, take
everyone upstairs.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.858
All right.
Come on, let's go.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.268
Hey, sit!

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.769
Hey, sit.

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:12.774
Okay.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:13.942
Now, co-pilot...

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.877
Where are we?

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:18.847
There doesn't seem
to be any islands.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:20.148
The co-ordinates
check out.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.984
There's simply no land.

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:24.686
Don't worry about
the land, just fly closer
to the co-ordinates.

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:26.321
But where are
we going to land?

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:28.123
Just do whatever he says.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.947
Wow!

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:53.248
Yeah, there.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:54.950
Land there.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.954
No, no I can't.
Yes!

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.022
Hey.

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:01.757
Sit down.

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.226
Yes, you can.

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:08.430
Landing an a390
on a carrier?

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:10.866
It's impossible,
the plane is too big.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.901
That carrier is a
class one nimitz,

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:15.170
that's three and a
half football fields.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.271
She can handle it.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.073
No, I really can't.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:21.843
Captain, you need
to teach your crew how
to follow orders.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.145
Land, now!

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.983
Hey, listen...

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:29.451
You can make it.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:32.988
Remember the carrier
landing strips at school?

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.791
The competition, you
beat me both times.

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.193
But, it was a simulator.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:42.097
I practiced for months,
and only succeeded twice.

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:45.067
Pretend it's
the same training.

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:48.003
Jason always
thought of you as the
most talented pilot.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.842
That's pretty good.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:55.444
I'm starting to like
you more and more.

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.185
Phew.

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.093
Where is everybody?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:22.938
This is suicide!

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.909
You knew the destination was
an aircraft carrier, didn't you?

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.212
Ruoxin's crazy.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.047
I'm beginning to
think you're crazy too.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:33.448
You're gonna
be okay, I promise.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.451
I, for one, think
the lady captain's
pretty damn cool.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:39.187
A crash, it strikes me
as a better way to go
than being eaten.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.024
I'm not gonna let her
destroy a hundred
million dollar plane.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:45.894
What the hell?

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:47.395
I think you should
just stay right there.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.536
See, even
at a time like this,

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.972
all my father cares about,
is his plane and his
damn company!

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:59.841
Yeah, that's all I got in
this damn world, is my damn
company, punk!

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:01.443
Yeah, I've known
that since I was ten!

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:07.883
If the plane crashes I will
never see my dad again.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.518
I haven't seen him
for a long time.

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.835
Who knew stress could
make a face so pretty.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.839
You should really play,
James Bond, man.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:11.880
Listen, I'll give you
one last chance to land.

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:15.183
You have this,
try again.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.585
I can't.
You have to!

01:04:16.587 --> 01:04:19.487
The tiniest miscalculation,
we'll crash onto the bridge,

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.323
or dive
straight into
the ocean.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.192
Let me do it.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.560
Are you sure
you can do better?

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:27.295
Do we have
any other choice?

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.431
You have control.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.999
I have control.

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.310
Get ready.

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:45.981
Locked.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.221
Deploy the landing gear.

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.297
Pull up!

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.039
The starboard
wing's hit.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:13.074
It's just the antenna.
Hold fast.

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:28.590
Monsters,
and insane women.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:30.358
Please just be
a nightmare.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.694
Ruoxin can land
this plane.

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:34.329
Everybody be ready
to unbuckle!

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:36.398
As soon as we land I'm
opening this door, understand?

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.400
Take care
of your girl, bro.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.172
Hey.
What?

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.341
That's for you.

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.724
Let's try,
one last time.

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:40.061
On my order,
empty the fuel tank.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:41.629
Are you sure?

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:41.629
Affirmative.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:44.766
The reduced weight
will shorten the
landing distance.

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:47.102
You better be right
about that, captain.

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.170
The plane is as
wide as a carrier.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.106
Our wing will
smash the bridge.

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.674
If there's
any fuel left,

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:55.143
the explosion
destroys everything.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:57.278
But the engines can
only last two minutes,

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.480
if we empty the fuel.

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.316
So, this is our
last chance.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.586
Let's do it!

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:06.287
Let's fucking do it!

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.498
Remember...

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.767
Once we touchdown,
go full flaps,

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.602
and help me pull
the speed brakes.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:22.504
What if we
go over the deck?

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:24.606
There is no
"what if" to this.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.342
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.212
Come on,
one at a time!

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.680
You take care of Mia.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.782
Don't be afraid
to run tight, go!

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.219
Get down!

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.693
Hold on tight!

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:43.785
The music.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.291
Kelly, come on, go.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.593
Go!

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:53.560
Mr. Kim, we
have to go. Come on.

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.576
We have to save him.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:44.279
Let's go!

01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:45.345
You keep going!

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.691
I can't leave this plane.

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.465
Argh!

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:11.806
Ruoxin!

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.517
Ah...

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:23.818
All right,

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.486
I got you.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:29.958
Okay.

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:37.465
I'm so sorry,
he was a hero.

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:39.567
I should have
been the last to leave.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:40.835
We have
to live for him.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.937
For all of them.

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:45.006
Come on.

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.814
Hey, you two,
get over here.

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:14.535
What is this place?

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:16.571
You'll find out later.

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:17.839
You seem
a little troubled.

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:19.340
Things not going
as planned.

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:21.542
Shut up!
Everybody move
to the edge.

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.344
That way.

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:31.853
Line up.

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.322
And get down
on your knees.

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:40.495
I will not ask again!

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.868
Good.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:49.737
Welcome to the world's
largest aircraft carrier.

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.507
It's actually...

01:11:52.509 --> 01:11:54.976
A shame that we don't
have any champagne
to celebrate.

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.546
But, if you
follow my orders...

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.715
No one else has to die.

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.553
If anyone moves,

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.322
kill them.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.890
I'm going down below
to get our money.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.558
And you can see
your son soon.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.562
Some of us are injured,
and we need help.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.867
You're right, captain.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:21.769
Help her up.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:36.718
You bastard! She
was already wounded!

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.852
All right!

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.821
There's no need to
kill anyone else.

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:42.123
You have us right
where you want us.

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.825
You don't get it,
do you, chef?

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:45.626
None of you do.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:47.795
The creatures
teeth are toxins,

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.897
she had far too many
wounds on her body,

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:52.734
to survive more than an
hour without the antidote.

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:53.868
What I did...

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.770
Was reduce her pain.

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:58.406
She should be grateful.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.074
Now, sit...

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:01.843
Back down.

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:02.977
All of you.

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:15.022
You watch them.

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:18.659
Think about your son,
and the money.

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.720
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:51.125
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.030
Dr. han,

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:58.733
Dr. han, hey...

01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:00.568
What the hell
happened here?

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.704
At last, you're here.

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:04.972
Listen,

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.874
this is a soil sample
from the cave.

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:09.210
Where is my
20 million dollars?

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.978
Everyone died...

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.114
The specimens
have mutated,

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:15.550
they started
to reproduce,

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:16.951
and it's all my fault.

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:17.652
Listen,

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:22.590
I know the company has
been dumping funding
into your research.

01:14:22.592 --> 01:14:24.759
So where is my money?

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:26.527
It's too late.

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:28.629
It's going to explode.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.898
The nuclear power
engines,

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.167
all set on self destruct.

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:36.471
Tell me where
my money is!

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.706
It's all over.
You just go.

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.876
No, uh...

01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:44.111
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:48.883
He doesn't care
about your life.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:50.184
Shut up!

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:51.752
He'll kill you as soon as
he gets what he wants.

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.223
He's right.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:57.091
Think about the child
on your necklace.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.663
Khadsa, what are you doing?

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:03.731
She's going to kill you.

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:05.867
Freeze!

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:18.079
The poison in her
body is taking effect!

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.782
We need to stop
the bleeding.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:25.753
Do you fly
a helicopter?

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.588
Anything
with propellers.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.657
What can't
you do, captain?

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:31.826
I'll start the helicopter,
you go find him.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:33.828
Wait, why do we
have to go find him?

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:35.129
We should just leave.

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:36.597
The guy's a time bomb.

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:37.832
Who knows if we'll
make it out of here

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:39.634
as long as he's around
it'd cause trouble.

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.135
Go with chef,
and help him.

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:42.603
Okay. Mike,
I'll go with you.

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:44.539
No, I've served on
an aircraft carrier before,

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:46.307
I know the
internal layout.
I'll be fine.

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.976
Hey,

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:50.845
come back soon.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.780
Of course, you haven't
tried my third dish yet.

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:54.815
We'll wait for you.

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:56.651
Let's go.

01:15:56.653 --> 01:15:57.852
Mr. Kim.

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:08.863
Are you hurt?

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.132
Nothing serious.

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:12.800
I just went
to get my cello.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.919
Gentlemen, we need your help,
go find the fuel.

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:54.275
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:00.348
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:06.153
Where is he?

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:08.189
Power room, quick.

01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:10.224
Everywhere, be careful.

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.660
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been canceled.</i>

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:14.362
What's happening?
What's going on?

01:17:14.364 --> 01:17:18.032
Destroy the ship,
don't let them reach land.

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:20.001
You must stop him.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:21.869
I will.

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:22.970
I just...

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.172
I just wanted to
make a medicine,

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:27.408
modifying genes.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.977
Reverse the growth
of cancer cells.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.078
I'm truly sorry.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.813
I went so wrong.

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.131
They're coming!

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.433
They're coming, let's go!

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.203
Let's go!

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.840
We have
to leave right now!

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.242
We're not full yet.

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:03.077
Come on, come on.

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.914
Come on.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:56.230
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.132
That's Nikki Lee's gun.

01:18:58.134 --> 01:18:59.800
Never thought you'd
kill a woman,

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:01.502
or anyone else
for that matter.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.204
She's safe.

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:05.873
Put the gun down, slowly!

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:08.242
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.281
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:19.954
You think you can
ruin my plan, chef?

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:21.455
Well, you can't.

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:23.824
I will find
another buyer,

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:27.194
and sell the soil sample
for twice as much.

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.097
You're insane.

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.567
You can't win.

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:33.060
<i> Self destruct has</i>
<i> been activated.</i>

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:31.051
Motherfuckers!

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:37.892
Come on!

01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:50.037
Come on, let's go,
we gotta get out of here!

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.345
Dad!

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:10.024
Colin!

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:11.225
Dad.

01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:12.993
Don't sell the company!

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.462
Dad, no!

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:17.197
No!

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.472
Climb, baby-climb

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:26.640
climb, baby-climb

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:28.475
climb, climb,

01:22:28.477 --> 01:22:30.244
climb, climb, aah...

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:34.481
Mike.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:08.349
Go as far as we can,
the whole ship's about
to explode!

01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:10.617
You know, my people
have this tradition,

01:23:10.619 --> 01:23:12.753
if a woman does point
a gun at them,

01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:14.288
you should marry her.

01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.256
Are you proposing,
because I'm Chinese,

01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:18.125
and I always have
the last word.

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:20.594
When this
is all done,

01:23:20.596 --> 01:23:22.496
I think I'm going to
need a real vacation.

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:24.064
Do you want company?

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:25.466
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:26.567
What do you have in mind?

01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:28.268
Anywhere without cats.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.722
I think I'm done
cooking on an airplane.

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.324
What about
your third dish?

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.559
How about
when we land?
