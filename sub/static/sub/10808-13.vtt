(theme music playing)

00:19.887 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:28.517
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:01.128 --> 01:04.632
"Behold, the great city
has fallen,

01:04.632 --> 01:09.370
"and is become
the habitation of devils

01:09.370 --> 01:13.907
"and the hold
of every foul spirit

01:13.907 --> 01:19.777
and a cage of every unclean
and hateful bird of prey."

01:24.151 --> 01:25.452
Hi.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.079
I'm Sarah McBride.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.417
I saw the sign outside.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.228
And you'd like to come
and work for us?

01:39.733 --> 01:41.394
Good.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.106
Tell me a little about yourself.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.095
Sarah?

01:52.646 --> 01:55.449
Do you, uh, hail
from these parts?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.384
No, l hail from New York.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.219
I'm gonna be a sophomore
at the college.

01:59.219 --> 02:03.357
I'll probably major
in American history.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.293
I'd really love to work
here, 'cause it's so...

02:06.293 --> 02:09.096
really historical.

02:09.096 --> 02:13.033
What a great old painting.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.370
| just love the past.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.361
Oh, yes.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.944
Despite all the hardships
and suffering,

02:23.944 --> 02:25.746
life was simple and pure,

02:25.746 --> 02:28.048
faith and virtue
uncorru pted--

02:28.048 --> 02:30.317
so unlike
these modern times.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.654
The people themselves
were more worthy.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.756
Really?

02:35.756 --> 02:39.126
Here at Colonial Village,
we live out the lives

02:39.126 --> 02:42.096
of the early settlers,
and the tourists come to watch.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.531
We're looking for someone
to sit at our spinning wheel

02:44.531 --> 02:46.467
and give demonstrations.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.870
0h, rats, I really don't know
anything about spinning.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.505
Don't worry.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.141
My daughter Jane will teach you
everything you need to know.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.776
You mean, I've got the job?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.077
You'll begin today.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.313
Today. Oh, I really
wasn't planning...

02:59.313 --> 03:00.481
Actually, I have to...

03:00.481 --> 03:03.650
But we need you very badly,
right now.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.787
Well, I guess I could
just make a call.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.449
Your costume is in the closet.

03:12.192 --> 03:12.851
Not that one!

03:14.061 --> 03:16.894
Uh, the one on the left.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.369
(door creaks)

03:22.369 --> 03:24.605
Oh, this is pretty!

03:24.605 --> 03:26.800
Please remove everything.

03:28.475 --> 03:32.844
No sign of
the 20th century allowed.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.315
Oh.

03:35.315 --> 03:36.976
Okay.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.880
I'll just be a minute.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.497
(sighs softly)

03:50.497 --> 03:52.362
Anything for a job, right?

04:04.745 --> 04:10.274
"...and a cage of every unclean
and hateful bird of prey. "

04:11.285 --> 04:13.754
(knocking)

04:13.754 --> 04:15.745
C-Come in.

04:17.324 --> 04:21.094
So, do I look like
a bona fide Puritan?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.530
Not quite authentic.

04:23.530 --> 04:27.489
You have that artificial color
on your face and lips.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.906
It was considered a sin
for women to paint their faces.

04:32.906 --> 04:37.277
Oh. I guess I never would have
made it then, huh?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.404
Probably not.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.250
And you have that ornament
dangling from your ear.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.819
0h. Sorry.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.790
I think maybe
it's a little bit long.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.725
My daughter Jane
will make it right for you.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.361
(creaking and squeaking)

04:54.361 --> 04:56.563
She's a very good girl.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.996
Sarah?

05:00.534 --> 05:03.837
Are you ready to become a part
of the past?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.205
(door creaks)

05:05.205 --> 05:07.196
All set, boss.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.972
(whooshing, whirring)

05:20.821 --> 05:23.255
(whirring)

05:38.672 --> 05:41.641
(whirring increases
in intensity)

05:51.218 --> 05:53.220
She'll work for us
a short while,

05:53.220 --> 05:56.356
and... and then likely be gone.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.825
Where did she come from, Father?

05:58.825 --> 06:01.094
It's of no consequence,
my dear Jane.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.963
She's just an apprentice.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.954
(wagon rattling in distance)

06:07.034 --> 06:08.968
She's waking up.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.306
What happened?

06:12.306 --> 06:14.207
Father says you fainted.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.343
The excitement of the day.

06:16.343 --> 06:19.046
(Sarah sighs softly)

06:19.046 --> 06:20.380
Oh.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.215
Feeling better now, Sarah?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.184
Yeah. I don't know.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.953
Yeah, I guess so.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.054
She's not well.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.181
She should go home.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.958
(Sarah sighs softly)

06:34.761 --> 06:36.830
Oh...

06:36.830 --> 06:39.132
Everything was spinning around.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.861
There was this awful noise.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.933
Maybe I should just go home.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.743
Sarah, I regret
that you feel ill,

06:49.743 --> 06:53.201
but if you leave, I can't save
the position for you.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.238
Oh.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.742
Okay.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.749
I really do need the job.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.060
I guess I'm all right.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.051
I'll stay.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.946
(Sarah laughs)

07:25.946 --> 07:28.548
No wonder the Pilgrims got
kicked out of England.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.118
They dressed like total nerds.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.021
The persecution had little
to do with dress.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.624
It was a struggle for the purity
of religious belief.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.926
(laughing): 0h, save it
for the tourists, Jane.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.095
Don't take your job
so seriously.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.565
Everybody around here could use
a little lightening up.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.701
(sheep bleating in distance)

07:47.701 --> 07:48.835
(door creaking)

07:48.835 --> 07:51.338
(sheep bleating)

07:51.338 --> 07:53.240
You must be the new apprentice.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.299
Who are you?

07:56.410 --> 07:58.412
I tend the fields.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.480
l shear the sheep.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.481
(sheep bleating)

08:01.481 --> 08:03.617
l mend the fences.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.380
A man of many talents.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.826
What does my Jane think?

08:12.826 --> 08:16.396
It's true, Peter.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.131
0h, back to work.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.466
JANE:
Yes, Peter.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.234
There's a lot to do
before supper.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.701
(sheep bleating)

08:33.380 --> 08:35.649
Boy, he's really
got you whipped.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.884
Gotta watch out
for those handsome ones.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.619
They always turn out
to be such devils.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.089
Please, I don't want you
to get in trouble.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.080
All right, I'll give it a whirl.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.690
I'm not the domestic type.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.102
You've never done this before,
have you?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.536
(laughs):
No way.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.939
They have this new thing out
now-- prefabricated cloth.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.141
You just go to the store
and buy it.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.642
Imagine that.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.667
Here, let me show you.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.283
Now watch.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.352
(wheel creaking)

09:12.352 --> 09:16.323
You know,
I think Peter likes me.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.825
We're going to be married
next month.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.160
Oops.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.729
Really?

09:22.729 --> 09:25.599
You can't be more than 16.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.801
Why do you want to tie yourself
down like that?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.236
Father promised me to him.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.504
That's nuts.

09:30.504 --> 09:31.671
He can't do that.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.573
It's not even legal.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.042
The Bible says, "Children, obey
your parents and prosper."

09:36.042 --> 09:37.544
That is the law, Sarah.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.079
Jane, I went
to Sunday school, too,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.780
but let's keep this stuff
in perspective.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.283
I mean, if your father told you
to tie a bag around your head

09:43.283 --> 09:45.183
and go jump in the
Charles River, would you do it?

09:48.522 --> 09:50.423
l-l don't think so.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.092
No.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.427
I hope my father would never
ask me to do anything

09:54.427 --> 09:55.762
as unreasonable as that.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.231
Mm-hmm. And if he told you
to get a gun and shoot

09:58.231 --> 10:00.700
the first person that walked in
the door, would you do it?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.903
Of course not.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.271
Why not?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.239
"Children, obey your parents
and prosper," right?

10:06.239 --> 10:07.741
But that would be madness.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.877
Yes. And so is getting married
at 16.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.879
You don't really even know

10:12.879 --> 10:16.583
if Peter's the right guy
for you yet.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.744
(women laughing)

10:20.754 --> 10:22.745
(giggling)

10:24.591 --> 10:26.354
(giggling)

10:27.894 --> 10:29.885
(laughter continues quietly)

10:31.097 --> 10:33.099
That yarn hasn't even
been touched.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.936
You've done no work all morning.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.170
I'm sorry, Peter.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.572
Her dress was too long.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.733
Don't apologize to him.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.268
You're not the boss.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.882
Be careful, Jane.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.440
You've pricked her.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.786
She did not.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.321
Sarah, please.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.523
Peter, I didn't.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.757
You did.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.282
I saw you prick her.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.089
Are you telling me
you didn't feel it?

11:05.131 --> 11:06.399
What is it with you?

11:06.399 --> 11:07.801
What does it matter?

11:07.801 --> 11:10.237
No, I didn't feel it,
because she didn't do it.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.228
So, you didn't feel it.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.510
That's enough sewing for now.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.307
Come to the table and eat.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.774
(sighing)

11:42.469 --> 11:45.071
Here's hoping.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.595
Wait!

11:47.641 --> 11:50.974
We'll say grace first.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.213
Grace.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.547
I'll say the grace.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.417
I don't expect my future wife
to contradict me.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.580
We'll say grace together.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.026
We'll say the Lord's Prayer.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.722
You don't have to do everything
he says.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.700
A wife's duty is
to obey her husband.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.191
Come on. Give me a break.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.000
Eat your supper, Jane.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.150
What is this?

12:30.150 --> 12:32.619
JANE:
It's venison.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.019
The others didn't like it,
either.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.419
What others?

12:39.893 --> 12:43.329
The ones that worked here
before you.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.430
(Jane gasps)

12:52.906 --> 12:54.441
How do you do that?

12:54.441 --> 12:56.376
-(door closing)
-Do what?

12:56.376 --> 12:57.844
What's the matter with you?

12:57.844 --> 13:00.813
(clock chimes twice)

13:03.216 --> 13:05.343
Where's the calendar?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.789
(scoffs)

13:09.789 --> 13:12.257
I could've sworn
there was a calendar there.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.359
What is going on around here?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.661
Who cleaned up this picture?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.971
This place is really weird.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.506
How do you call forth the fire
at your fingertips?

13:37.751 --> 13:40.379
It's a cigarette lighter, Jane.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.990
What's the matter with you?

13:43.990 --> 13:47.060
What's the matter with everyone
around here?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.229
The others...

13:49.229 --> 13:51.598
that Father brought
before you...

13:51.598 --> 13:54.601
he said they were witches.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.036
Are you one of them, too?

13:57.036 --> 13:58.264
A witch?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.208
You poor kid.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.472
What have those two
got you thinking?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.015
(sighs) I'm gonna get my clothes
and get out of here.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.017
lwish I could take you with me.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.152
You do?

14:12.152 --> 14:14.287
I sure do.
I can't stand the thought

14:14.287 --> 14:16.423
of leaving you here with those
two pushing you around.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.825
You're not a witch.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.627
Of course not.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.495
No, you don't understand.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.897
Peter's gone to get Father.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.465
They mean to do you harm.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.767
Nobody's gonna do nothing.
I'm getting out of here.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.636
There's no time!

14:29.636 --> 14:31.627
We must hurry!

14:32.639 --> 14:33.873
-Oh.
-(gasps)

14:33.873 --> 14:35.708
-Father, we were just...
-Hold your tongue!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.177
-But...
-Si|ence!

14:37.177 --> 14:39.078
There are things
you don't understand.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.569
This is no affair of yours.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.950
I quit.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.019
You can keep your old job.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.253
Come on, Jane.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.788
-Seize her!
-No!

14:48.788 --> 14:49.956
God! Let go of me!

14:49.956 --> 14:51.924
-You disobey me.
-Let go of me!

14:54.994 --> 14:56.985
(Sarah groans)

14:59.199 --> 15:01.434
(groans)

15:01.434 --> 15:02.635
Father, please!

15:02.635 --> 15:04.125
-Be silent.
-(grunting)

15:05.839 --> 15:07.006
FATHER:
Listen to me.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.808
Did you not witness all
that Peter told me?

15:08.808 --> 15:12.178
She felt nothing
when you pricked her with a pin.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.147
Peter, tell him
it isn't true!

15:14.147 --> 15:16.616
She could not say
the Lord's Prayer,

15:16.616 --> 15:18.985
the very fires of Hell appeared
at her command.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.386
She has bewitched you

15:20.386 --> 15:23.823
into rebellion against your
father and your future husband.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.359
You twist things.
She is not a witch!

15:26.359 --> 15:27.360
Silence!

15:27.360 --> 15:28.761
SARAH:
This isn't happening!

15:28.761 --> 15:30.930
It's 1986!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.693
People don't believe in witches.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.401
It's you!

15:35.401 --> 15:36.336
(Jane gasps)

15:36.336 --> 15:37.937
You disobey me again,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.139
and you will end up like her.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.675
(chains rattling)

15:42.675 --> 15:44.677
Come, child.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.480
SARAH:
Help me!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.849
(wailing, sobbing):
Somebody, please!

15:49.849 --> 15:51.918
Help me!

15:51.918 --> 15:53.887
No one can hear you, Sarah.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.155
Somebody, please!

15:56.155 --> 15:57.624
Help me!

15:57.624 --> 15:59.615
I'll be back.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.719
-(door closes)
-Oh.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.799
(sighs)

16:06.799 --> 16:08.790
(crickets chirping)

16:15.174 --> 16:16.609
Shh!

16:16.609 --> 16:18.304
-Shh.
-Oh.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.677
In a moment, you'll be free.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.292
Are you all right?

16:32.292 --> 16:34.317
I've definitely been better.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.332
You can only rest a moment.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.701
Then you must go back
where you came from.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.760
Just point me
in the right direction.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.307
Your father is crazy.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.142
We have to call the police.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.710
My father is the law here.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.045
He's the village magistrate.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.148
-But--
-No one will help you but me.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.450
Jane, I'll call my parents.
My dad...

16:57.450 --> 16:59.919
Sarah, you have to understand.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.388
This is the year 1692.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.924
Not 1986.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.927
Three women have been hanged
as witches this year.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.896
-Real|y?
-(door opening)

17:09.896 --> 17:11.464
(rustling)

17:11.464 --> 17:13.399
(footsteps approaching)

17:13.399 --> 17:15.299
(door creaking)

17:18.071 --> 17:19.732
What are you doing?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.140
-Run!
-Ow!

17:29.616 --> 17:31.174
Not that one!

17:33.186 --> 17:34.887
SARAH: This is the door.
I'm sure of it.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.081
JANE:
This door's already been locked.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.089
What are you doing?

17:43.363 --> 17:45.627
Please. I just want to go back
where I came from.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.198
I can't let you do that.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.671
-Let her go, Father.
-You little fool.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.307
You would defend her against
your own flesh and blood?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.571
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

17:57.377 --> 17:59.145
We sacrificed everything,

17:59.145 --> 18:02.181
then came to this rough,
hard country to make a new life.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.984
The anguish was more
than we could bear.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.587
That's when I was granted
my vision of the future--

18:07.587 --> 18:09.355
the world as it would be.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.657
Your world!

18:10.657 --> 18:12.325
Which we will die to make.

18:12.325 --> 18:16.159
I've taken from the future
to help save the past.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.731
You don't make any sense!

18:18.731 --> 18:22.335
Our people are beginning
to turn against one another.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.170
They need something
to bind them together.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.906
A common enemy, a scapegoat.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.466
I give them witches.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.880
I give them you, Sarah.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.081
No! Look out!

18:35.081 --> 18:36.215
-(blows striking)
-JANE: Oh!

18:36.215 --> 18:37.842
(Jane yelling)

18:39.986 --> 18:41.453
What have you done?!

18:42.755 --> 18:44.814
You made me turn
against my daughter.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.817
(grunting and muttering)

18:53.099 --> 18:54.233
(wheel squeaking)

18:54.233 --> 18:56.269
(door creaking)

18:56.269 --> 18:57.336
Look!

18:57.336 --> 19:00.039
Run, Jane!
I'm right behind you.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.473
(whirring hum)

19:08.047 --> 19:10.072
Jane!

19:11.284 --> 19:13.352
(wheel squeaking)

19:13.352 --> 19:15.688
My God, what have I done?

19:15.688 --> 19:18.088
(wheel squeaking)

19:20.226 --> 19:21.921
(explosion)

19:24.831 --> 19:26.132
It's destroyed.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.835
(whirring fades)

19:28.835 --> 19:31.099
She's lost.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.775
(whirring stops)

19:35.775 --> 19:37.766
(birds singing)

19:48.488 --> 19:50.547
(children shouting in distance)

20:02.769 --> 20:03.758
(door shuts)

20:33.332 --> 20:35.323
J‘J‘

20:38.838 --> 20:40.439
(clicking)

20:40.439 --> 20:42.430
(gavel banging)

20:49.081 --> 20:53.452
So concludes the trial
of Sarah McBride,

20:53.452 --> 20:56.956
accused of certain detestable
arts called witchcraft

20:56.956 --> 20:59.091
and sorceries,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.127
which she wickedly,

21:01.127 --> 21:05.198
maliciously and feloniously
have exorcised

21:05.198 --> 21:08.734
upon and against
the people of Salem.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.369
CROWD (chanting): Burn the
witch! Burn the witch!

21:10.369 --> 21:12.735
In the year 1692.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.584
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.119
Waiting for us to enter.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.356
Waiting to enter us.

21:30.356 --> 21:36.784
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
