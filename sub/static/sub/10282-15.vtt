WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:06.474
Previously on ER:

00:12.546 --> 00:14.148
Okay.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.584
WEAVER:
Dr. Lockhart,
Mr. Scanlon...

00:16.617 --> 00:18.586
Kerry... I'm
mixing up some Ancef.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.820
I'm just gathering up
some supplies.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.389
Dubenko's working him
pretty hard

00:21.422 --> 00:22.823
and my place is closer
to the hospital.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.226
So sleeping over
at his place
would be convenient.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.594
PRATT:
I'm not into research
and I don't care

00:26.627 --> 00:27.795
about publishing.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.696
You're going to be
looking for a job

00:28.729 --> 00:30.131
in a couple of years.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.199
You're going to look
back on this time

00:31.232 --> 00:32.165
and wish you'd
stepped up.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.368
How do you stand it?
What?

00:34.402 --> 00:36.036
The responsibility.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.378
Whoa!

00:44.412 --> 00:45.313
Slow down there, buddy.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.280
Sorry, ma'am.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.217
Did he just call me "ma'am"?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.384
Yeah.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.853
Because technically
I'm a "miss."

00:52.886 --> 00:54.688
Maybe you project
maturity.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.257
Meaning I look old?

00:56.290 --> 00:58.792
No, you look beautiful,
you look youthful

00:58.826 --> 01:00.528
and not a day over 16.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.396
Seriously,
if you didn't know me,

01:02.430 --> 01:04.331
would you think
I had a fifth-grader?

01:04.364 --> 01:06.400
No, no.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.868
But I could see you
with a toddler.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.238
Ugh, God...

01:10.271 --> 01:13.174
Sleep deprivation,
diapers, teething--

01:13.207 --> 01:16.144
been there, done that.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.849
Is that something you think
you might want again?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.384
Kids?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.619
You?

01:25.653 --> 01:27.388
I don't know.

01:27.421 --> 01:31.159
I can't really imagine
myself with an infant again.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.230
WOMAN:
We gotta go. We gotta go.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.398
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas--

01:37.431 --> 01:38.766
take it
for five minutes

01:38.799 --> 01:40.534
and then Christopher
can have it for five minutes.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.171
( dog barking )
Calleigh...
Calleigh... shh.

01:43.171 --> 01:43.771
( phone ringing )
I got it.

01:43.804 --> 01:44.772
Would you take that?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.340
Hello?

01:46.374 --> 01:48.876
It's not just his.
It's mine, too!

01:48.909 --> 01:52.380
Mom, can I go to Stacy's
house after practice?

01:52.413 --> 01:53.847
No. One of you
take the dog out.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.783
You do it.
She can be such a bitch.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.418
Okay, kids, your father.
Come on.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.519
I know. Okay,
I got to go.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.520
My dad's here.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.554
I got to go. Bye.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.190
Here we go. Here we go.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.224
Take your coat.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.725
Okay, you got,
you got?

02:04.758 --> 02:07.461
You got your trumpet?
Come on, you guys.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.797
All right. Don't try
and sweet-talk your dad, okay?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.199
The answer is no.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.400
Please close the door!

02:12.433 --> 02:13.801
Thank you. Have fun.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.536
( phone ringing )

02:15.569 --> 02:17.205
( softly ):
Oh...

02:17.205 --> 02:18.906
Hello?

02:18.939 --> 02:22.610
Hi, Pam.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.812
Can I call you right back--
five minutes?

02:24.845 --> 02:27.781
Okay, great, thanks so much.
Bye.

WOMAN:
You know, I'm, I-I'm
really feeling okay now.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.571
I-I-I just got a little dizzy.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.240
Pulse ox 99 on two liters.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.807
I just got a little dizzy.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.643
PARAMEDIC 2:
Got another call!

02:55.676 --> 02:56.610
Lower Wacker MVC.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.911
Lucky us.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.847
I-I-I think I'm going
to be okay,

02:59.880 --> 03:02.283
so if you could just take me
back home?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.552
I-I-I really appreciate
your coming,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.387
and every... thing you've...

03:06.420 --> 03:07.821
Sir?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.957
Sir?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.292
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.
Hello, Doctor.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.260
What happened?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.594
35-year-old woman,

03:13.627 --> 03:14.962
found down in her
kitchen by a neighbor.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.630
Probably had too much coffee,
or...

03:16.664 --> 03:17.965
Aphasia and
right hemiparesis.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.700
...or maybe some kind
of anxiety attack.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.801
A little young
for a CVA.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.336
Is she hypertensive?

03:22.370 --> 03:25.273
Last BP: 128/76.
My dad had high blood pressure.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.574
What's open?
I don't.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.741
Trauma One.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.277
Ma'am, can you tell us
your name?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.444
Yes, Ellie.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.612
Sorry?

03:31.645 --> 03:32.846
My name is Ellie Shore.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.915
TAGGART:
What'd she say?

03:34.948 --> 03:37.951
( slurring unintelligibly )

04:34.775 --> 04:37.678
( loud, thrashing rock music
playing )

04:55.463 --> 04:56.697
See you later, Ray!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.632
You heading in?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.534
Yeah.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.870
Guys. I'll give you a ride.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.573
I'm working
tonight anyway.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.675
I thought we were trying
for opposite shifts.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.410
I had to make a switch.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.645
We have a gig on Saturday.
I'm sorry.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.714
Is it okay with you

05:13.747 --> 05:15.383
if the guys stay here?

05:15.383 --> 05:16.650
Cool.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.556
Hi.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.694
Y-You play anything?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.497
The viola.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.839
SHORE:
That's kind of bright.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.707
LOCKHART:
Pupils four
millimeters,

05:39.740 --> 05:40.874
equal and reactive.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.876
Nobody is listening to me here.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.612
Normal sinus on the monitor.
Am I slurring?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.013
Chest is clear.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.648
Is there something wrong
with my tongue?

05:47.681 --> 05:48.749
Right-sided
facial droop.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.418
Face feels kind of numb.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.119
Maybe I'm not talking
loud enough.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.487
TAGGART:
Glucose is 96.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.888
LOCKHART:
Normal rhythm.
No murmur.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.890
( louder ):
Excuse me. Where am I?

05:56.924 --> 05:59.593
( unintelligible mumbling )

05:59.627 --> 06:00.961
Ma'am, you're at
County Hospital.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.796
We're going to take
care of you, okay?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.698
County? Great.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.734
LOCKHART:
Can you squeeze
my hand?

06:06.767 --> 06:09.437
Yeah. Look, I don't know what
that paramedic guy told you,

06:09.437 --> 06:10.904
but honestly, I'm fine,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.673
so you can just stop
doing all this, okay?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.508
Hemocue is 13.7.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.044
Let me up and call me a cab,
and I'll be on my way.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.680
Now squeeze
with your right.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.549
What did you just do?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.484
As hard as you can,
squeeze.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.486
I, uh...

06:25.519 --> 06:27.521
Anything?

06:27.555 --> 06:29.657
I...

06:29.690 --> 06:31.592
Was that my arm?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.827
Because I-I didn't feel it.
I didn't feel anything.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.062
LOCKHART:
Absent DTRs
on the right.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.630
What's wrong with my arm?

06:36.664 --> 06:37.865
What's wrong with my arm?!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.533
LOCKHART:
Positive Babinski.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.502
Oh, God,
where's my leg, my foot?!

06:41.535 --> 06:42.870
Why can't I feel my f...?!

06:42.903 --> 06:45.573
Okay, call Neuro,
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:45.606 --> 06:46.874
and let's get a head CT.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.542
Wait, what are you...?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.710
Those are my pants.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.778
Miss, please...

06:50.811 --> 06:51.779
Not my underwear!

06:51.812 --> 06:53.046
I'm not... try to...

06:53.080 --> 06:54.147
I'm not staying!

06:54.181 --> 06:56.149
Just try to relax, okay?

06:58.486 --> 07:00.053
Ma'am, I'm going
to put

07:00.087 --> 07:01.755
a catheter into your bladder.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.625
There might be some discomfort
as it passes, okay?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.696
( yells )

07:11.164 --> 07:12.633
You do this every day off?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.034
Usually, it's a 10K.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.770
Oh, so you're cutting me
some slack, are you?

07:16.804 --> 07:17.805
Just keeping it fun.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.839
You need to stop?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.741
Nah. I got another mile in me.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.510
How about a water break?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.848
( coughs )

07:27.881 --> 07:29.049
Want some?

07:29.082 --> 07:32.152
No, I'm good.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.788
You know, it's
been three months.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.690
Oh, yeah? Since what?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.058
( chuckles softly )

07:38.091 --> 07:40.528
What do you want to do
for dinner tonight?

07:40.561 --> 07:43.230
I don't feel much
like going out. You?

07:43.263 --> 07:44.965
Not really.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.802
Race you to the fountain.
Winner cooks, loser cleans?

07:48.836 --> 07:50.003
You're on.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.839
Ready, set...

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
Hey.
What?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.008
Happy three-month
anniversary.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.810
Hey...!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.814
JANE:
Dr. Pratt, my MVC couple's

08:00.848 --> 08:03.283
ready to go home,
but the husband's
got a broken foot,

08:03.316 --> 08:04.785
the wife's eye
is patched...

08:04.818 --> 08:05.786
And the car's probably totaled.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.087
Get 'em a taxi voucher.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.656
Dr. Pratt, where do I turn in
my PPD results?

08:08.689 --> 08:09.757
Employee Health, second floor.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.891
Dr. Pratt, I
was wondering,

08:10.924 --> 08:12.259
do you have
any dating tips

08:12.292 --> 08:13.827
for someone on a
med student's budget?

08:13.861 --> 08:15.095
( rueful chuckle ):
Yeah, don't bother.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.630
No, it's
incredibly flattering.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.931
That'd be great.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.767
I'll let you know
who'll be attending.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.268
Okay, thank you
very much.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.870
Good news?

08:22.903 --> 08:23.937
We're being honored

08:23.971 --> 08:25.673
at the Trauma
Foundation dinner.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.807
Oh, nice.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.241
Yeah, they're looking

08:28.275 --> 08:30.911
for an outstanding
senior resident to accept.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.078
So, why tell me?

08:32.111 --> 08:33.813
Pratt, don't fish
for compliments.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.948
It doesn't become you.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.116
8:00 P.M. on the 16th,

08:36.149 --> 08:37.784
seven-minute
PowerPoint presentation

08:37.818 --> 08:39.587
with slides and video.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.054
Cozying up with
management again?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.923
Not in this lifetime.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.892
Hey, a bunch of us
are meeting up
at Ike's later

08:44.925 --> 08:46.627
to celebrate Weaver
going on vacation.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.995
If "third years" are buying,
I'm in.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.296
Well drinks only.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.831
Figure it'll help
shore up support

08:50.864 --> 08:51.865
for my Chief Resident bid.

08:51.899 --> 08:52.933
Neela, what do you say?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.935
Well, beats going home.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.203
Something wrong with home?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.171
Come on. We
laugh, we bond.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.674
We do a little
team-building with
our ducklings here.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.942
Sure.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.044
All right! Woo-hoo!
Party on!

09:04.077 --> 09:07.080
What, the big kids
aren't invited?

09:07.114 --> 09:11.151
SHORE:
It's like my lips are moving,
but nothing's coming out.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.820
I don't feel sick; I don't

09:12.853 --> 09:14.622
No carotid bruits.
feel anything.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.289
Platelets are good.
Well, I feel some things.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.958
PT/PTT's normal.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.860
What do you think it is?
This is bad, isn't it?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.729
Onset of symptoms
is too quick for a tumor.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.831
Aneurysm or AVM?
I have three kids. I'm 35.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.933
KOVAC:
Could be a
hypercoaguable state.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.968
Might've thrown a clot.
The kids. Oh, my God.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.771
CT's backed up.
Neuro's on the way.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.372
KOVAC:
Have a name
on her yet?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.007
Yeah. Ellie.
Excuse me.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.709
KOVAC:
Ellie, I'm going
to close your eyes

09:35.743 --> 09:36.810
just for a second.
Wait a minute.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.211
I have to tell you something.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.847
Somebody's got
to pick up my kids.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.181
You have to call my husband.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.783
Orbicularis oculi
deficit on the right.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.885
LOCKHART:
You thinking
it's embolic?

09:44.918 --> 09:45.986
Yeah, more
than likely

09:46.019 --> 09:47.688
to the proximal
left MCA.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.923
Please? I...

09:49.957 --> 09:53.026
I think, uh,
she wants to write something.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.795
KOVAC:
Go ahead and
let her try.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.363
LOCKHART:
So, TPA could reverse it.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.898
KOVAC:
If there's no bleed,

09:57.931 --> 09:59.332
and if we're
within three hours,

09:59.366 --> 10:01.702
but no one knows how
long she's been down.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.904
Ellie, can you hear me?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.205
Yes, yes, yes, I can hear you.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.640
His name is Dan.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.375
We think you may
have had a stroke.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.210
The kind that makes
it impossible

10:10.243 --> 10:11.979
for you to express
any language.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.815
So, while you might be
able to understand us...

10:14.848 --> 10:17.651
TAGGART:
Luka.

10:17.685 --> 10:22.355
...we definitely won't be able
to understand you.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.924
That's not what I wrote.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.893
What did you do
with what I wrote?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.294
Neuro says they're not coming
without a CT.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.862
That's not what I wrote.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.430
Right now,
we're trying to figure out

10:30.463 --> 10:31.965
what type of stroke you had

10:31.999 --> 10:33.000
so that we can
treat it, okay?

10:33.033 --> 10:34.267
I had a stroke?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.103
See if you can track
down any family members.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.370
That's impossible.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.939
Old people get strokes.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.841
I mean, whatever this is,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.910
it's just temporary.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.378
It has to be.

10:47.948 --> 10:48.949
Hey.
Hi.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.350
What's up?

10:50.383 --> 10:53.320
Uh, I'm just down
on a surgical consult.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.456
Uh, did I, by any chance,
leave a watch at your place?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.925
Yeah. It's in my locker.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.059
Abby, you still need

10:59.092 --> 11:00.460
that cathed UA
on Mrs. Russell?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.029
No, clean catch. Negative dip.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.230
Oh.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.099
Uh, I-I brought in
some lunch,

11:06.133 --> 11:08.969
if maybe you'd want to meet up
in the break room later on.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.771
Well, actually,
I was thinking

11:10.804 --> 11:15.743
that maybe we shouldn't be
quite so together... here.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.011
Uh, I thought everybody
already knows.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.012
Well, I didn't tell anybody.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.213
Um...
( chuckling )

11:20.247 --> 11:22.049
Except maybe one person.
Did you?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.383
No.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.852
So, good.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.856
Your sofa getting much action
these days?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.023
Uh... what?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.491
Living with Ray is,
how can I put it--

11:31.524 --> 11:32.960
loud, messy
and a bit crowded.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.762
You could take your
time moving out.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.963
Yeah, but
it's not as though

11:35.996 --> 11:37.164
it was any better
at your place.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.331
Who's next?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.933
Six-year-old
with wrist pain.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.471
Is there a Clayton Davis?

11:44.504 --> 11:45.839
Over here.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.907
You Clayton?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.842
I'm Tucker,
his big brother.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.378
He's got a bump on his head.
Show her.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.013
This hurts, too.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.983
How'd all this
happen, Clayton?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.985
He fell off
the kitchen counter.

11:58.018 --> 11:58.986
And who are you?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.253
She's our sister, Bridget.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.889
Whole family's here, huh?

12:01.922 --> 12:03.123
My dad went
to get some coffee.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.892
Well, I can take
Clayton in for now,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.326
but before he can be treated,

12:06.359 --> 12:08.095
I'll need your father
to sign some forms.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.030
I'll go find him.

12:10.063 --> 12:10.998
Okay.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.466
So, young man,

12:13.500 --> 12:16.036
what were you doing
on top of a kitchen counter?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.038
Reaching for a bowl.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.940
We were hungry.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.474
Let me find out where to go.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.914
Hi. My neighbor
was brought here earlier.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.315
I have her kids with me.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.549
Her name is Ellie Shore.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.418
ELLIE:
Okay, okay.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.822
If by some chance
this is a stroke, it's minor.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.823
It has to be.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.224
I can think, I can hear.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.358
CT's ready
for her.
Feel, right?

12:38.391 --> 12:39.827
Okay, put her on
a portable monitor

12:39.827 --> 12:40.460
and suction
the secretions.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.962
Am I drooling?

12:41.995 --> 12:44.097
Yeah, I am.
I'm drooling.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.298
Ellie,

12:45.332 --> 12:47.234
this'll make you
more comfortable.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.402
She's smiling, maybe
that means it's not so bad.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.171
But she's the nurse.
Maybe she doesn't know.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.940
Okay, Ellie, I'm going
to look in your mouth.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.507
All right?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.576
She's a doctor.
She's not smiling as much.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.846
Maybe she's just more serious.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.313
No gag reflex.
Maybe not.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.349
Her swallowing muscles
are weak on the right side.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.917
Now, this one, he is gorgeous.

13:03.951 --> 13:04.985
Tube her
just to be safe?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.954
What is he? 6'4", 6'5"?

13:06.987 --> 13:09.056
Yeah. Ellie,
we're going to have

13:09.089 --> 13:10.924
to put a tube
in your throat

13:10.958 --> 13:11.925
to protect your airway.

13:11.959 --> 13:12.960
Can they come in?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.194
Yeah, okay,
just for a minute.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.863
TAGGART:
Ellie, your kids are here.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.864
They are?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.173
She can hear you better
if you guys stand over there.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.875
Why?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.943
Because your mom is having
a little trouble moving

13:29.977 --> 13:31.144
the right side of
her body, right now.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.946
Hi, guys.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.115
Don't be scared, okay?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.984
Is that why her face
looks funny?

13:37.017 --> 13:38.285
Oh...

13:38.318 --> 13:39.452
Is she dying?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.188
No.
No, honey.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.190
No, Mommy's not dying.
She's gonna be fine...

13:43.223 --> 13:44.424
When did you
see her last?

13:44.457 --> 13:47.027
Um, right after school.
She was fine.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.630
( coughing violently )

13:50.663 --> 13:53.200
Ma'am, I think you should
take them outside.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.035
Why is she doing that?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.069
Well, we just
need to give her

13:56.103 --> 13:57.070
a little help
breathing, okay?

13:57.104 --> 13:57.905
She'll be fine.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.239
Come on, kids.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.974
Let the doctors
take care of your mom, okay?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.175
Mommy?
Come on.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.478
( coughing continues )

14:05.512 --> 14:07.114
Push the etomidate
and sux.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.481
You're going to sleep now.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.017
When you wake up,
you'll be breathing

14:10.050 --> 14:11.318
with the help of a ventilator.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.953
( coughing )

14:14.487 --> 14:15.655
ELLIE:
Oh, God...

14:15.688 --> 14:17.357
Am I dead?
Is this it?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.326
Is this death?

14:21.061 --> 14:23.463
No, something's wrong.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.132
I can't open my eyes.
