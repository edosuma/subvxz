WEBVTT

00:04.666 --> 00:06.700
Good morning.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.002
Isn't it, though?

00:08.004 --> 00:10.804
- Charlie.
- Zach.

00:10.806 --> 00:12.406
What are you doing here?

00:12.408 --> 00:14.975
Well, I work here... for today, anyway.

00:14.977 --> 00:16.911
I know. It's just, aren't you
not supposed to be talking

00:16.913 --> 00:17.878
to any of the staff?

00:17.880 --> 00:20.481
Uh, it's no trial, Zach.

00:20.483 --> 00:22.950
Look, I wish I didn't
have to go at all,

00:22.952 --> 00:24.385
but, you know, when the board calls.

00:24.387 --> 00:26.220
You answer. No, I get it.

00:26.222 --> 00:28.255
No way around it, just like
there was no way around

00:28.257 --> 00:30.024
Dawn filing a complaint
in the first place.

00:30.026 --> 00:31.592
Where is she, by the way?

00:31.594 --> 00:33.227
Worried about you.

00:33.229 --> 00:37.197
Seriously, it's eating her up.
She didn't come in today.

00:37.199 --> 00:39.667
Hey, listen.

00:39.669 --> 00:41.569
You smell like a distillery.

00:41.571 --> 00:43.504
I think you should just go home
and wait for them to call you.

00:43.506 --> 00:45.639
No. I'm here to fight for my job.

00:45.641 --> 00:47.441
[sighs] This is my home.

00:50.812 --> 00:52.346
Yikes.

00:52.348 --> 00:54.582
I'm up next in the boardroom
for his assessment.

00:54.584 --> 00:56.717
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how painful is that?

00:56.719 --> 00:58.886
Almost as painful as being
stuck in the E.R.

00:58.888 --> 01:00.521
instead of some killer surgery.

01:00.523 --> 01:01.956
Just so you know, I put myself here.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.123
Lucky me.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.425
I thought it would only be fair

01:04.427 --> 01:06.360
to the other residents,
you know, lead by example.

01:06.362 --> 01:07.928
Right. Because there weren't

01:07.930 --> 01:10.364
- any cool surgeries on the docket today?
- Yeah.

01:10.366 --> 01:11.532
Well, how about this?

01:11.534 --> 01:13.300
Skateboarder with Q-tip in the ear.

01:13.302 --> 01:14.301
He's all yours...

01:14.303 --> 01:15.736
Chief.

01:15.738 --> 01:16.804
[sighs]

01:21.109 --> 01:22.509
[sighs]

01:23.945 --> 01:26.947
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

01:32.153 --> 01:33.954
Good morrow, Dr. Sekara.

01:33.956 --> 01:36.824
Oh, uh, hey.

01:36.826 --> 01:38.626
We're not supposed to see each
other before the board...

01:38.628 --> 01:41.395
Relax, Dev. It's not our wedding day.

01:42.998 --> 01:44.732
What can I tell you?

01:44.734 --> 01:45.899
I went out last night,

01:45.901 --> 01:48.102
ordered the bourbon chicken,
hold the chicken.

01:48.104 --> 01:51.305
- Uh-huh.
- The Board call you in?

01:51.307 --> 01:54.508
Oh, yeah. They called, like, everyone.

01:54.510 --> 01:56.443
[cellphone vibrates]

01:56.445 --> 02:00.414
I totally forgot. Um, and I have to go.

02:03.685 --> 02:04.818
Dr. Harris.

02:06.421 --> 02:09.256
Don't worry. I got your back.

02:09.258 --> 02:11.458
Thank you.

02:16.031 --> 02:18.065
- Alex.
- Yep.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.967
It's my morning to bring him
to daycare.

02:19.969 --> 02:21.402
I totally forgot. I'm sorry.

02:21.404 --> 02:22.403
It's fine. I got it.

02:22.405 --> 02:24.905
How are you dealing with today?

02:24.907 --> 02:27.741
Well, all I got to do is tell
them the truth, right?

02:27.743 --> 02:29.643
- The truth.
- What?

02:29.645 --> 02:31.578
Nothing.

02:31.580 --> 02:33.947
Alex, I need you on my side for this.

02:33.949 --> 02:36.150
When have I not been on your side?

02:36.152 --> 02:38.218
Did you sleep in those clothes?

02:38.220 --> 02:40.554
Um, they do look a little
familiar, actually.

02:40.556 --> 02:43.057
- [sighs]
- It's okay. I got a suit in my office.

02:43.059 --> 02:44.992
Okay. Charlie...

02:44.994 --> 02:46.794
have you been drinking?

02:46.796 --> 02:48.262
Because you've got to pull
yourself together.

02:48.264 --> 02:49.697
You have to figure out
what you're gonna say.

02:49.699 --> 02:51.165
The Board is gonna want
to know why you're...

02:51.167 --> 02:52.299
Screwing up?

02:52.301 --> 02:54.535
Well, yeah.
You walked out on a surgery.

02:54.537 --> 02:57.604
Oh. Glad you're not speaking
on my behalf.

02:57.606 --> 02:59.039
Charlie.

03:03.611 --> 03:05.245
Good chat.

03:05.247 --> 03:08.449
[elevator dings]

03:08.451 --> 03:10.317
[sighs]

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.328 --> 03:22.496
Oh, there you are. Dr. Reid!

03:22.498 --> 03:23.997
Mrs. Crace.

03:23.999 --> 03:27.668
I understand today must be
incredibly stressful for you,

03:27.670 --> 03:30.404
so I wanted to give you
the opportunity to speak

03:30.406 --> 03:32.806
to the Board during
Charlie's assessment.

03:32.808 --> 03:35.509
Oh. Wow. Well, I was
under the impression

03:35.511 --> 03:36.844
I wouldn't be allowed to.

03:36.846 --> 03:40.013
Is something wrong?
I-I thought you'd be happy.

03:40.015 --> 03:42.850
No. You know what?
It's great. Thank you.

03:42.852 --> 03:45.419
Good. Keep your schedule
relatively clear.

03:45.421 --> 03:47.087
We'll notify you of a time.

03:48.823 --> 03:51.425
[sighs] That is wonderful.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.178
Hey.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.180
You need to get back in bed.
I haven't discharged you yet.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.982
Actually, you said I was healing
really quickly

04:25.984 --> 04:27.483
and I could probably go home tonight.

04:27.485 --> 04:29.418
Probably isn't definitely.

04:29.420 --> 04:33.022
Here. I brought you a present.

04:33.024 --> 04:35.391
Oh, wow. That's really
beautiful. You shouldn't have.

04:35.393 --> 04:36.792
It's a spirometer to make sure

04:36.794 --> 04:38.327
you're breathing at full capacity.

04:38.329 --> 04:40.129
Now, a lot of people after surgery

04:40.131 --> 04:42.198
tend to shallow breathe
because it hurts.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.333
We want to make sure your lungs
won't collapse.

04:44.335 --> 04:47.069
Breathing is my thing. I'm good.

04:47.071 --> 04:48.571
All right.

04:48.573 --> 04:50.039
Put your mouth on this piece,

04:50.041 --> 04:52.174
breathe in slowly,
and what you want to do is,

04:52.176 --> 04:54.377
you want to make sure
that this little blue disc

04:54.379 --> 04:56.679
gets to 1250 milliliters.

04:56.681 --> 04:57.980
Fine. Easy.

04:59.349 --> 05:01.417
[disc rattles]

05:03.887 --> 05:05.454
[panting] What the hell?

05:05.456 --> 05:06.822
Hurts?

05:06.824 --> 05:08.758
No. It's just broken.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.528
All right. Breathe in it
a few times every hour.

05:12.530 --> 05:14.463
Until you get to 1250,
you're not going anywhere.

05:14.465 --> 05:15.931
Great.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.567
Have you thought about my offer?

05:18.569 --> 05:19.935
To help you?

05:19.937 --> 05:22.138
'Cause your energy is kind of like...

05:22.140 --> 05:24.573
It's like a fountain spewing gunk.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.409
Most people would understand it

05:26.411 --> 05:28.444
as a thick, disgusting, black cloud,

05:28.446 --> 05:30.346
- kind of just permeating everything.
- You know what? You're just saying that

05:30.348 --> 05:32.014
- because I didn't discharge you.
- That is <i>not</i> true.

05:32.016 --> 05:34.917
Come on. What's going on?

05:34.919 --> 05:36.252
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

05:36.254 --> 05:37.386
Or, I will be fine.

05:37.388 --> 05:40.022
Thank you, though, but I'm... I'm fine.

05:40.024 --> 05:42.758
Well, you just said "fine"
about 20 times.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.493
Okay. My ex, he's a doctor,
he works here.

05:44.495 --> 05:45.895
He's going in for an assessment.

05:45.897 --> 05:47.430
I have to give a character evaluation.

05:47.432 --> 05:48.531
[cellphone vibrates]

05:48.533 --> 05:50.032
I also have to get to my next consult,

05:50.034 --> 05:51.700
so I'll come back in
and I'll check on you,

05:51.702 --> 05:53.069
and in the meantime, deep breaths.

05:53.071 --> 05:54.570
Yeah, you too.

05:54.572 --> 05:56.772
[siren wails in distance]

06:03.713 --> 06:07.249
Well, just the deceitful spirit
I didn't want to see.

06:07.251 --> 06:10.152
I hear the Board has been called
in to investigate you.

06:10.154 --> 06:12.288
Yes. No thanks to you.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.489
To me?

06:13.491 --> 06:15.091
Yeah. Your, uh, lack of honesty

06:15.093 --> 06:17.760
about your current... situation.

06:17.762 --> 06:19.195
Not a big help.

06:19.197 --> 06:21.997
You were on a collision course
with a breakdown,

06:21.999 --> 06:23.399
with or without me, Sir.

06:23.401 --> 06:24.633
Now you can leave me alone,

06:24.635 --> 06:26.435
because I need to prep
to fight for my job.

06:26.437 --> 06:29.371
- Uh, no. Charlie, we...
- Not going?

06:29.373 --> 06:31.640
Okay, I will.

06:38.081 --> 06:40.082
[mouthing words] I'm sorry.

06:41.852 --> 06:44.220
[sighs]

06:44.222 --> 06:47.022
I read in your profile
that your favorite book

06:47.024 --> 06:49.492
is "Lila Zila
and the Watermelon Smash."

06:49.494 --> 06:50.993
Now... Now, I read the book,

06:50.995 --> 06:54.230
and I found it particularly
empowering for children,

06:54.232 --> 06:57.032
especially young girls.

06:57.034 --> 06:59.435
[exhales] Do you concur?

06:59.437 --> 07:00.569
I'll try that again.

07:00.571 --> 07:03.038
Shazam! [Laughs]

07:03.040 --> 07:05.474
Anjali! Wow. What are you doing here?

07:05.476 --> 07:07.643
Mm-hmm-hmm!

07:07.645 --> 07:09.145
Okay, that's enough. Yes.

07:09.147 --> 07:12.248
Right. The 3-second-hug rule.
I almost forgot.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.049
So, are you joining
the obstetrics staff?

07:14.051 --> 07:15.851
Nah. Don't get your hopes up, Shazam.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.020
Just followed a patient here.

07:18.022 --> 07:21.891
Right. You're very good
at following people.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.692
You should've just told me
you were gay.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.828
I did. I said that repeatedly.
I said, "I'm gay."

07:25.830 --> 07:28.197
Well, water under the bridge.
I need your help with a case.

07:28.199 --> 07:31.000
26-week fetus with spina bifida.

07:35.005 --> 07:36.939
Wow. This is the most severe case

07:36.941 --> 07:38.941
of Myelomeningocele that I've seen.

07:38.943 --> 07:40.543
Very good. I was scheduled to perform

07:40.545 --> 07:43.179
a laparoscopic in-utero repair
today with Dr. Solomon.

07:43.181 --> 07:44.647
So, what does this have to do with me?

07:44.649 --> 07:46.115
Solomon's mother died last night.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.317
- That's unfortunate.
- It is.

07:48.319 --> 07:50.219
And I don't know how long
he's gonna be out for.

07:50.221 --> 07:53.489
You are the only other surgeon
in this city

07:53.491 --> 07:55.257
qualified to perform this surgery.

07:55.259 --> 07:57.526
Falak, that's our patient.

07:57.528 --> 07:58.594
Our?

07:58.596 --> 08:00.029
She's at the 26-week mark.

08:00.031 --> 08:03.065
Right now is the target of
opportunity for optimum results.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.367
No. I'm sorry.

08:05.369 --> 08:06.902
Anjali, you know, I made a promise

08:06.904 --> 08:08.804
that I don't do pediatric
surgeries anymore.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.940
- Why not?
- Because, it's, um...

08:10.942 --> 08:13.742
I... I'm sorry. It's complicated,

08:13.744 --> 08:17.513
you know, and, uh, um,
thank you for stopping by.

08:17.515 --> 08:20.749
I have a chili to prepare. Thank you.

08:20.751 --> 08:21.784
See you.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.356
Right. Right. [Clears throat]

08:27.358 --> 08:31.894
"Lila Zila and the Watermelon Smash."

08:31.896 --> 08:34.530
Why did <i>you</i> like this book?

08:35.698 --> 08:37.099
Oh!

08:37.101 --> 08:39.735
Special delivery for Dr. Williams.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.071
Yeah. I... can see you.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.940
You know what? I'm good. If you
want to... You can have those.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.875
It's called globophobia.
Fear of balloons.

08:46.877 --> 08:48.611
Mm-hmm.

08:48.613 --> 08:51.647
Uh, don't you already have
a phobia of parasites?

08:51.649 --> 08:52.982
Oh, doesn't everyone? Aah!

08:52.984 --> 08:55.084
Besides, is there a limit to the number

08:55.086 --> 08:56.919
of paralyzing fears one can have?

08:56.921 --> 08:58.687
[panting] Does it say who it's from?

08:58.689 --> 09:01.223
Oh, God! Seriously, is
this some kind of sick joke?

09:01.225 --> 09:03.125
Lit doesn't say. The card reads,

09:03.127 --> 09:05.794
"Think of you often." That's it.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.430
Well, aren't we just saving
the world here?

09:08.432 --> 09:10.432
Look, I got to get to
the Harris inquisition.

09:10.434 --> 09:12.134
Do you think you can manage
the E.R. by yourself?

09:12.136 --> 09:13.869
- Me?
- Yes, you.

09:13.871 --> 09:15.037
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:15.039 --> 09:16.772
Will you just take those
with you when you go?

09:16.774 --> 09:19.174
You got it. Ginkgo biloba.

09:19.176 --> 09:22.778
It's called globophobia.
And good luck in there.

09:22.780 --> 09:26.649
It is a... total witch hunt.

09:26.651 --> 09:29.918
Oh, man. Okay.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.121
[exhales deeply] They're gone.

09:32.123 --> 09:34.223
Dr. Bell finished the aortic dissection

09:34.225 --> 09:36.292
while Dr. Sekara repaired the bleeders,

09:36.294 --> 09:38.694
and he walked out.

09:38.696 --> 09:40.262
Just like that.

09:40.264 --> 09:42.865
Did he give any explanation
for his actions?

09:42.867 --> 09:45.167
In a roundabout way.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.435
What does that mean?

09:46.437 --> 09:49.972
Dr. Harris always has an explanation

09:49.974 --> 09:51.373
for his unorthodox behavior.

09:51.375 --> 09:54.076
Anyone who goes into surgery
with him just accepts that.

09:56.313 --> 09:58.847
Charlie and I met 10 years ago
at this hospital.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.383
And since then, we've be...

10:01.385 --> 10:03.786
No. No, no. No!

10:03.788 --> 10:06.488
Um...

10:06.490 --> 10:09.992
the past several years,

10:09.994 --> 10:14.463
Charlie... has become a bit
of a miracle worker.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.267
How does he perform said miracles?

10:18.269 --> 10:20.736
Well, you ask, he talks to ghosts.

10:20.738 --> 10:23.172
[paper tears]

10:23.174 --> 10:26.241
Hey. I didn't mean to, uh...

10:26.243 --> 10:29.178
Uh, it's just that this thing
is, for sure, broken,

10:29.180 --> 10:31.580
like, won't go past 800, so...

10:31.582 --> 10:34.083
But, while I'm here,

10:34.085 --> 10:36.085
who talks to ghosts?

10:41.691 --> 10:43.739
First of all, you need
to get back in bed.

10:43.741 --> 10:46.008
And, secondly, you really
shouldn't be here.

10:46.010 --> 10:47.410
No, I know. I'm sorry.

10:47.412 --> 10:49.579
I didn't mean to interrupt
you... with yourself.

10:50.495 --> 10:52.515
You know I do this for a living, right?

10:52.517 --> 10:55.017
- What? Stalk people?
- Speak.

10:55.019 --> 10:56.319
Your speech. You said you need

10:56.321 --> 10:57.820
to write a statement about your ex.

10:57.822 --> 11:00.690
Clearly, you're struggling,
so let me help.

11:00.692 --> 11:02.592
I'm bored to death in here.

11:02.594 --> 11:05.728
This thing ain't great company.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.631
Fine. I'm not quite sure
what I want to say.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.566
Well, how about the truth?

11:10.568 --> 11:11.601
It's not that simple.

11:11.603 --> 11:13.469
The truth could cost Charlie his job.

11:14.564 --> 11:16.172
Oh, is this the thing about the ghosts?

11:16.174 --> 11:18.240
<i>He's</i> the one that talks
to the ghosts?

11:18.242 --> 11:19.875
We're done here. Yeah.

11:19.877 --> 11:21.210
Hold on a second. No, no, no, no.

11:21.212 --> 11:22.445
No. What did you say to me

11:22.447 --> 11:24.347
before you convinced me to cut me open?

11:24.349 --> 11:26.816
You said we needed to trust each other.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.517
Don't rip your stitches, huh?

11:28.519 --> 11:32.421
I will not open my stitches...
if you slow down.

11:32.423 --> 11:36.325
Dr. Reid. [Grunts]

11:36.327 --> 11:39.061
I can't believe none of
our staff supervisors

11:39.063 --> 11:40.930
have a single surgery today.

11:40.932 --> 11:41.931
Baloney.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.666
Well, I'm kind of glad in a way.

11:43.668 --> 11:44.900
Nerves got me all...

11:44.902 --> 11:46.002
What's the word?

11:46.004 --> 11:47.837
Nervous?

11:47.839 --> 11:50.006
How am I supposed to go
in front of the Board

11:50.008 --> 11:51.273
and talk about Dr. Harris?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.709
[clears throat] Excuse me.
What are you eating?

11:53.711 --> 11:55.544
Mm. This is chili from the lounge.

11:55.546 --> 11:57.613
It is delicious. Why? Do you want some?

11:57.615 --> 12:00.282
- That chili...
- Dr. Hamza?

12:00.284 --> 12:01.384
My name is Falak.

12:01.386 --> 12:03.719
I'm Dr. Vrnasi's spina bifida patient.

12:03.721 --> 12:05.788
Well, I mean, technically,
<i>he's</i> her patient.

12:05.790 --> 12:09.425
I've already talked
to Vrnasi about this.

12:09.427 --> 12:11.027
Wait, wait, wait. Is this... Wait.

12:11.029 --> 12:13.562
You're doing a spina bifida
operation on a fetus?

12:13.564 --> 12:16.499
- No.
- But if you were...

12:16.501 --> 12:18.300
He'd be taking these loose nerves

12:18.302 --> 12:20.302
mushrooming out of the hole
in the baby's spine

12:20.304 --> 12:21.570
and tucking them back in.

12:21.572 --> 12:23.205
- Can I get in on that?
- Can I get in on that?

12:23.207 --> 12:25.541
I'm not operating today.

12:25.543 --> 12:26.676
Can I talk to you?

12:31.515 --> 12:32.715
Look, I'm in the process

12:32.717 --> 12:34.550
of giving this baby up for adoption,

12:34.552 --> 12:37.053
and I'm afraid that no one's
going to want to adopt

12:37.055 --> 12:38.521
a physically-disabled baby.

12:38.523 --> 12:42.692
And, while I'm still this
child's... incubator person,

12:42.694 --> 12:45.394
I need to do everything
I can to help him.

12:45.396 --> 12:47.263
Please?

12:47.265 --> 12:49.065
Falak... [clears throat]

12:49.067 --> 12:51.000
Even if this surgery is successful,

12:51.002 --> 12:52.234
best case scenario,

12:52.236 --> 12:54.670
is that this baby learns how
to walk with crutches.

12:54.672 --> 12:57.206
It's a very risky surgery
for your baby.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.407
I know it is.

12:58.409 --> 13:00.876
But research shows that
this is the optimal time

13:00.878 --> 13:03.679
to have an operation done,
and I want this surgery now.

13:04.681 --> 13:06.716
[siren wails in distance]

13:08.719 --> 13:10.686
Finally! Hi.

13:10.688 --> 13:12.588
Hi. I'm Dr. Williams. How are y...

13:12.590 --> 13:16.726
Yeah, so I have a menstrual cup
stuck up my... me.

13:16.728 --> 13:19.028
I don't even know why I tried
the damn thing.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.530
My teenage daughter was going on
and on about it.

13:21.532 --> 13:25.334
Anyway, I got up this morning
and I couldn't get it out.

13:25.336 --> 13:28.270
I tried all the positions. No bueno.

13:28.272 --> 13:30.873
So, it's your turn.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.409
And your family doctor was
unavailable, I am assuming?

13:33.411 --> 13:35.511
Oh, he was. Just not until tomorrow.

13:35.513 --> 13:38.814
And I... have a third date tonight.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.552
You know, for someone who works
in an emergency room,

13:43.554 --> 13:44.687
you move kind of slow.

13:44.689 --> 13:48.491
Well, that's because
normally I'm a surgeon.

13:48.493 --> 13:51.227
I'm Jennifer, by the way.

13:51.229 --> 13:53.195
Scoot your bum forward.

13:55.665 --> 13:57.366
Spread 'em.

14:01.171 --> 14:04.507
Oh, hey. Remember me?

14:04.509 --> 14:06.976
That was wildly unfair.
You just operated on me.

14:06.978 --> 14:08.077
You are relentless.

14:08.079 --> 14:09.979
Look, you know what? Hear me out.

14:09.981 --> 14:12.081
I have this, like, karma
superstition thing, okay?

14:12.083 --> 14:14.250
So, if you're not going to let
me help you for you,

14:14.252 --> 14:17.319
please, let me help you for me.

14:17.321 --> 14:18.888
Nice try with the reverse psychology.

14:18.890 --> 14:21.123
So, let me get this straight.
This is going to help you?

14:21.125 --> 14:22.291
Yes.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.626
Unbelievable.

14:23.628 --> 14:25.528
Look, who cares if Charlie sees ghosts?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.730
Okay, first of all,
I didn't say that. You did.

14:27.732 --> 14:29.431
But who cares? So what?

14:32.235 --> 14:34.303
Hey, you know what? I have an idea.

14:36.039 --> 14:37.439
What are you doing?

14:37.441 --> 14:40.709
It's a ridiculous idea,
but that's the point.

14:40.711 --> 14:43.212
We are meant to laugh. Right?

14:43.214 --> 14:45.915
Laughter lowers our inhibitions
and encourages vulnerability.

14:45.917 --> 14:48.517
Vulnerability then encourages truth.

14:48.519 --> 14:50.219
You get the first huff.

14:50.221 --> 14:51.620
You have got to be kidding me.

14:51.622 --> 14:53.789
Fine. More for me.

14:53.791 --> 14:56.325
[inhales deeply]

14:56.327 --> 14:58.427
[squeaky voice] Damn it.
That was a really good one.

14:58.429 --> 15:00.563
[laughs] I should've saved it
for my spirometer.

15:00.565 --> 15:02.364
Come on.

15:02.366 --> 15:03.833
[balloon pops]

15:03.835 --> 15:05.601
You want me to speak the truth?

15:05.603 --> 15:08.504
You know what? I-I-I watched
some of your video podcasts,

15:08.506 --> 15:09.972
and they were great. They really were,

15:09.974 --> 15:11.140
but I think something's missing

15:11.142 --> 15:12.508
from your
"Speaking the Truth" series.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.176
I mean, maybe you're just going around

15:14.178 --> 15:15.377
trying to help other people

15:15.379 --> 15:17.213
as to escape your own life
and your own past.

15:17.215 --> 15:19.515
You know what? I told you
about my past in confidence.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.217
Yeah, and I appreciate that.
I really do.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.052
But that doesn't mean
I'm going to turn around

15:23.054 --> 15:24.854
and talk to you about
everything in my life.

15:24.856 --> 15:26.088
I'm sorry.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.990
Yeah. All right.

15:27.992 --> 15:30.993
Good luck with your speech.

15:32.896 --> 15:34.763
[sighs]

15:34.765 --> 15:36.332
Damn it.

15:37.701 --> 15:40.903
Yeah, moody. God-complex,
delusions of grandeur.

15:40.905 --> 15:42.838
You're describing every surgeon
I work with here.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.540
Why would Charlie Harris
be any different?

15:44.542 --> 15:47.443
Look, do you mind... if I eat this?

15:47.445 --> 15:49.044
I didn't get a chance to grab lunch.

15:49.046 --> 15:51.814
I'm very busy.

15:51.816 --> 15:55.651
Would you consider Dr. Harris
as mentally unstable?

15:56.586 --> 15:58.520
Sure.

15:58.522 --> 16:02.458
I mean, Einstein had depression.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.660
Darwin, agoraphobia, OCD.

16:04.662 --> 16:06.295
Beethoven was bipolar.

16:06.297 --> 16:07.696
There have been links drawn.

16:07.698 --> 16:09.865
Great thinkers have mental disorders.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.001
Charlie Harris is a great surgeon.

16:12.003 --> 16:14.169
Unconventional in his process, yes.

16:14.171 --> 16:16.505
But has Dr. Harris's recent behavior

16:16.507 --> 16:19.475
been alarming to you on any level?

16:19.477 --> 16:20.910
No.

16:20.912 --> 16:22.845
Are you concerned about him?

16:25.949 --> 16:28.851
I'm not <i>not</i> concerned.

16:36.126 --> 16:39.228
I came here to be alone.

16:39.230 --> 16:40.696
Me too.

16:40.698 --> 16:44.266
It's the only place
that I can hear myself think.

16:47.304 --> 16:49.104
Could you shove over?

16:49.106 --> 16:51.473
I'm sitting for two people
here, basically.

16:51.475 --> 16:53.275
[groaning]

17:04.954 --> 17:07.489
Charlie sees ghosts.

17:10.026 --> 17:12.261
He talks to dead people.

17:14.097 --> 17:16.265
How am I supposed to tell
the Board that?

17:16.267 --> 17:18.733
Why don't you just say that to them?

17:20.036 --> 17:21.670
It's his truth.

17:21.672 --> 17:24.606
Okay, <i>his</i> truth,
but not <i>the</i> truth.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.741
There is a difference.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.209
So you believe there's only one truth?

17:27.211 --> 17:28.978
No, I don't know what I believe.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.546
All I know is that his truth

17:30.548 --> 17:32.448
affects the people around him.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.850
It affects his patients
and Luke and me.

17:34.852 --> 17:37.953
Is that why you guys aren't together?

17:37.955 --> 17:39.588
No. Actually, it's because,

17:39.590 --> 17:44.026
beyond all reason,
I think that I'm cursed.

17:44.028 --> 17:46.695
So you believe in your curse
but not his ghosts?

17:48.832 --> 17:51.000
You... have a point.

17:53.703 --> 17:56.772
Would it help if you see what he sees?

18:12.222 --> 18:15.691
I've been doing a little
eavesdropping on your behalf.

18:15.693 --> 18:18.494
Your colleagues are loyal,
if that's any consolation.

18:18.496 --> 18:21.230
They're confounded by you,
but they believe in you.

18:21.232 --> 18:23.599
Yeah, unfortunately,
that may not count for much.

18:23.601 --> 18:25.401
It's true.

18:25.403 --> 18:28.003
Now you're poring over your case files.

18:28.005 --> 18:30.739
You want to be prepared
to win the fight.

18:30.741 --> 18:32.074
It's not going to do any good, Charlie.

18:32.076 --> 18:33.242
Meaning?

18:33.244 --> 18:36.545
Meaning this is going
to happen over and over.

18:36.547 --> 18:38.480
Why... Are you my personal savior?

18:38.482 --> 18:40.149
A-Are you my spiritual guide?

18:40.151 --> 18:42.051
'Cause you're just as lost as I am.

18:42.053 --> 18:44.686
I didn't want to lie to you,
Charlie. Truly, I didn't.

18:44.688 --> 18:45.954
But that didn't stop you, did it?

18:45.956 --> 18:47.289
If I told you I was a ghost,

18:47.291 --> 18:49.091
you would've tried to help me,
made me your mission,

18:49.093 --> 18:51.393
- but you're the one that needs the help, Charlie.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:51.395 --> 18:54.396
That's right. This is about you.

18:54.398 --> 18:57.332
Are you ready to let me
help <i>you,</i> Charlie?

18:57.334 --> 18:59.802
Do you think you can trust me?

18:59.804 --> 19:01.937
No, Amos, I can't.

19:03.473 --> 19:08.744
[sighs]
Well, this is really disappointing!

19:08.746 --> 19:10.913
Because I'm stuck here until you do.

19:13.516 --> 19:14.683
[sighs]

19:17.153 --> 19:19.254
I just want to remind you
that this isn't permanent.

19:19.256 --> 19:20.589
It's just gonna be temporary.

19:20.591 --> 19:24.493
Don't... Don't do this for me,
or even Charlie.

19:24.495 --> 19:25.928
Do this for you.

19:27.497 --> 19:28.997
Are you ready?

19:28.999 --> 19:31.733
Okay. Knock yourself out.

19:34.871 --> 19:38.140
Okay. I just want you
to close your eyes.

19:38.142 --> 19:42.544
Take a deep breath. Okay?

19:42.546 --> 19:46.482
I want you to think about
your favorite place.

19:46.484 --> 19:48.383
[breathes deeply]

19:51.154 --> 19:55.257
You're a very practical person, Alex.

19:55.259 --> 19:58.927
But now it's time for you to surrender.

20:00.964 --> 20:04.700
Trust that you have the power...

20:04.702 --> 20:07.836
to handle anything that comes your way.

20:08.838 --> 20:13.041
See what Charlie sees.

20:13.043 --> 20:16.044
Through the love you grew.

20:16.046 --> 20:17.613
[laughs]

20:17.615 --> 20:18.714
[baby cries]

20:18.716 --> 20:20.716
Children you conceived.

20:28.725 --> 20:30.092
[breathes deeply]

20:38.835 --> 20:40.402
[exhales slowly]

20:40.404 --> 20:43.338
Do you see what Charlie sees?

20:43.340 --> 20:45.174
[gasps]

20:45.176 --> 20:46.542
Charlie?

20:49.179 --> 20:51.280
Charlie!

20:51.282 --> 20:52.848
Amos: Hello.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.850
Hello?

20:54.852 --> 20:57.052
Anyone? Can anyone help me?

20:57.054 --> 20:59.655
Excuse me. Can you help me?

20:59.657 --> 21:01.390
Excuse me. I'm looking for Charlie.

21:01.392 --> 21:03.091
Charlie.

21:03.093 --> 21:04.426
[sighs]

21:04.428 --> 21:06.828
You can see me. Oh, that feels good.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.230
How do you know Charlie?

21:08.232 --> 21:10.666
Oh, uh, I've been working with him.

21:10.668 --> 21:12.501
I'm Amos.

21:12.503 --> 21:14.236
I... I need help.

21:14.238 --> 21:15.571
That came out wrong.

21:15.573 --> 21:17.739
Look, five years, you don't understand.

21:17.741 --> 21:19.575
I've been stuck here, in limbo.

21:19.577 --> 21:22.945
The pain, you have no idea
the frustration!

21:22.947 --> 21:25.013
But now I've found him...
this Charlie...

21:25.015 --> 21:27.115
he's the only one who can help me.

21:27.117 --> 21:30.219
Please. Please, Alex, talk to Charlie.

21:30.221 --> 21:31.653
I don't... I don't know how
to help you.

21:31.655 --> 21:33.622
I-I don't know how, but I'll find him.

21:33.624 --> 21:34.856
I'll find him.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.458
Layla: Whenever you're ready,

21:36.460 --> 21:40.629
I want you to open your eyes
and meet me back in the chapel.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.068
Welcome back.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.736
How do you feel?

21:47.738 --> 21:49.838
[strained] Charlie.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.241
I need... I need to...

21:52.243 --> 21:53.942
I need to...

21:53.944 --> 21:55.377
Wait. Alex?

21:55.379 --> 21:56.612
Alex?

21:59.278 --> 22:01.500
[sighs]

22:01.502 --> 22:03.602
- Dr. Reid, what happened?
- I'm all right.

22:03.604 --> 22:05.437
I just fainted.
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

22:05.439 --> 22:06.972
Let's get Dr. Reid to Bed 5 right now.

22:06.974 --> 22:08.407
Zach, really, I'm... I'm all right.

22:08.409 --> 22:09.541
No. I want a full blood panel,

22:09.543 --> 22:10.842
and get me the portable
ultrasound machine.

22:10.844 --> 22:12.744
- Yeah.
- I just need a minute.

22:12.746 --> 22:13.845
And maybe some juice.

22:13.847 --> 22:15.914
Get Dr. Reid some juice.

22:15.916 --> 22:19.384
Zach, honestly, I'm fine.

22:19.386 --> 22:21.486
Okay.

22:21.488 --> 22:23.488
Crace: How long have you
known Dr. Harris?

22:23.490 --> 22:28.393
11 years. As a colleague
and as a patient.

22:28.395 --> 22:29.795
As a patient?

22:29.797 --> 22:31.229
Yes. When he was in a coma

22:31.231 --> 22:33.966
and then again when they
discovered and operated on

22:33.968 --> 22:35.767
a tumor on his occipital lobe.

22:35.769 --> 22:38.236
The surgery did have its complications,

22:38.238 --> 22:39.871
but Charlie pulled through.

22:39.873 --> 22:43.241
You know, his brain is
unbelievably resilient,

22:43.243 --> 22:44.509
I have to say.

22:44.511 --> 22:47.145
It's not uncommon for
neurological difficulties

22:47.147 --> 22:49.014
to present themselves post-surgery,

22:49.016 --> 22:54.086
even years later... migraines,
dizziness, depression.

22:54.088 --> 22:56.488
Did he ever mention
any of those symptoms to you?

22:56.490 --> 22:57.622
No.

22:57.624 --> 23:00.192
But could Dr. Harris's recent behavior

23:00.194 --> 23:02.094
be linked to something neurological?

23:02.096 --> 23:04.162
Can you be more specific, please?

23:04.164 --> 23:06.665
Walking out of an active
operating theatre

23:06.667 --> 23:08.467
with a patient on the table.

23:08.469 --> 23:09.901
Hmm.

23:09.903 --> 23:13.605
Dr. Hamza, could that be linked
to something neurological,

23:13.607 --> 23:16.174
in your professional opinion?

23:16.176 --> 23:18.810
It's possible, yes.

23:18.812 --> 23:21.780
[cellphone vibrates]

23:23.149 --> 23:26.318
Okay. If you'll excuse me, I am
needed in the operating room.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.754
- Of course.
- Okay. Thank you.

23:30.523 --> 23:34.059
Welcome to Hope Zion Airlines.

23:34.061 --> 23:35.494
My name is Dr. Vrnasi.

23:35.496 --> 23:37.329
I'll be your pilot. Hop up here, love.

23:37.331 --> 23:39.364
Oh.

23:39.366 --> 23:42.868
On behalf of my flight team,
Drs. Sekara and Scott,

23:42.870 --> 23:44.002
do you have any questions?

23:44.004 --> 23:45.337
Where's Dr. Hamza?

23:45.339 --> 23:47.172
Oh, he's still making his way
through customs.

23:47.174 --> 23:48.373
[laughs]

23:48.375 --> 23:49.608
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a board meeting.

23:49.610 --> 23:51.643
- Ah, yes. Charlie Harris.
- Mm.

23:51.645 --> 23:52.844
How do you know Dr. Harris?

23:52.846 --> 23:54.646
Everyone knows about Dr. Harris.

23:54.648 --> 23:56.281
I don't know if I can do this.

23:56.283 --> 23:58.817
Oh, that's quite common.

23:58.819 --> 24:01.787
In fact, I would be concerned
if you weren't scared.

24:01.789 --> 24:04.089
No. I-I mean giving up my baby.
I mean, <i>the</i> baby.

24:04.091 --> 24:06.324
I mean, I-I don't know if I can
give it up for adoption,

24:06.326 --> 24:07.492
if it's the right decision,

24:07.494 --> 24:09.361
because the father's not
in the picture anymore

24:09.363 --> 24:10.862
and my mom's really pressuring me,

24:10.864 --> 24:12.831
but I really do want this baby
to go to a family

24:12.833 --> 24:14.032
that's ready and willing for this

24:14.034 --> 24:15.367
I can't believe I'm telling you
all of this.

24:15.369 --> 24:18.737
Okay. Falak,
you are the mother, okay?

24:18.739 --> 24:20.038
Yeah.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.974
And you're going to make the
best decision for your baby.

24:22.976 --> 24:25.877
And I'm going to be with you
100%, whatever you decide.

24:25.879 --> 24:27.913
You're a father, aren't you?

24:27.915 --> 24:30.315
I can tell. You give off that vibe.

24:30.317 --> 24:32.918
Dr. Vrnasi:
Mm. You and Jonathan took the plunge!

24:32.920 --> 24:36.088
Wish you would have told me.
I'd offer to be a surrogate.

24:36.090 --> 24:38.757
Actually, Jonathan and I are
going the adoption route.

24:38.759 --> 24:40.659
We're meeting a pair
of foster siblings tonight.

24:40.661 --> 24:42.060
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

24:42.062 --> 24:43.829
Jonathan's your husband?

24:43.831 --> 24:47.432
Not exactly, but he is my main man.

24:47.434 --> 24:49.401
Dr. Sharpe:
All right. Good to go here, guys.

24:49.403 --> 24:51.403
Great. Okay. So, let's just, um...

24:51.405 --> 24:52.904
Here we go. Easy.

25:08.421 --> 25:10.055
[sighs]

25:26.072 --> 25:28.173
What do you want?

25:35.281 --> 25:37.749
What do you want from me?!

26:01.541 --> 26:04.042
[monitor beeping]

26:07.580 --> 26:12.417
Okay. There's a deep pocket here.

26:12.419 --> 26:14.319
Yeah, this is the best spot we've got.

26:14.321 --> 26:17.889
It's furthest away from the baby
and placenta.

26:26.199 --> 26:27.699
Scope in.

26:29.035 --> 26:31.870
It's so alien-like.

26:31.872 --> 26:35.173
Hey, little guy. We come in peace.

26:35.175 --> 26:37.409
Hmm. Dr. Sekara, shift him
proximally, please.

26:37.411 --> 26:38.743
All right.

26:42.081 --> 26:45.050
Damn it. Let me see that.

26:45.052 --> 26:45.732
What is it?

26:45.733 --> 26:47.686
The way this baby's positioned,
it's not going to work.

26:47.688 --> 26:49.688
If his back is down,
he won't turn over.

26:49.690 --> 26:52.424
I can't approximate the sides,
laparoscopically.

26:52.426 --> 26:54.459
So, what do we do?

26:54.461 --> 26:56.328
Let's get a uterine stapler.

26:56.330 --> 26:57.562
You want to open her up?

26:57.564 --> 26:59.831
You're going to operate
directly on the exposed baby?

26:59.833 --> 27:01.132
Yes.

27:03.703 --> 27:05.537
[child giggling]

27:05.539 --> 27:08.073
There's a man here
with a dog bite in Bed 2

27:08.075 --> 27:09.841
that needs to be irrigated.

27:09.843 --> 27:11.276
You're making friends
with the patients, I see.

27:11.278 --> 27:13.211
"Dr. Stupid-face."

27:13.213 --> 27:15.680
- Tommy Nuenos.
- Pbht!

27:15.682 --> 27:17.983
Bed 6. He's a little pissed off

27:17.985 --> 27:20.352
'cause I stuck a needle in his thigh.

27:20.354 --> 27:21.987
Okay. We're really running behind.

27:21.989 --> 27:23.321
Can you page Dev and Billy

27:23.323 --> 27:25.090
and have them come down and help out?

27:25.092 --> 27:26.424
Nah, no can do.

27:26.426 --> 27:28.627
They're both in Shahir's
in-utero spina bifida surgery.

27:28.629 --> 27:30.595
What? No. Wait.

27:30.597 --> 27:32.197
How do you know that
and <i>I</i> don't know that?

27:32.199 --> 27:33.598
I saw them in the lounge on my break.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.267
They were headed to scrub
in like an hour ago.

27:35.269 --> 27:37.636
- Oh, man! Spina bifida!
- Are you okay?

27:37.638 --> 27:39.304
Me? Okay?

27:39.306 --> 27:41.640
You mean, me, resident,
who's been practicing suturing

27:41.642 --> 27:43.608
every Saturday night
for the last six years,

27:43.610 --> 27:45.143
and I'm not in some cool surgery

27:45.145 --> 27:47.846
because two other residents
who work half as hard as I am

27:47.848 --> 27:50.048
are there and I'm stuck with Q-tip guy

27:50.050 --> 27:52.317
and menstrual-cup girl
and dog-bite guy?

27:52.319 --> 27:54.152
Yeah, I'm fine!

27:54.154 --> 27:58.957
Uh, this box came for you.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.792
[monitor beeping]

28:02.128 --> 28:05.096
Okay there, first mate. More suction.

28:05.098 --> 28:07.599
I'm just going to move baby
around here a touch

28:07.601 --> 28:09.601
to get the exposure you need, Hamza.

28:09.603 --> 28:10.902
[chuckles] He's mooning us.

28:10.904 --> 28:12.337
Little prankster.

28:12.339 --> 28:15.307
Shahir: I'm giving baby pain meds.

28:15.309 --> 28:16.875
I.M. injection administered.

28:16.877 --> 28:19.177
Second mate, make sure
you're keeping a close eye

28:19.179 --> 28:20.445
on our little guy's heart.

28:20.447 --> 28:22.614
I don't think second mate's
a thing, but you got it.

28:22.616 --> 28:24.749
Good contractility. Normal Doppler.

28:24.751 --> 28:25.884
Heart rate's perfect.

28:25.886 --> 28:27.686
Scalpel, please.

28:27.688 --> 28:30.922
Okay, Drs. Sekara and Scott,
pay attention here.

28:30.924 --> 28:32.824
This is the exposed nerve tissue

28:32.826 --> 28:35.193
that I'll be dissecting
from the meninges.

28:35.195 --> 28:39.164
Now, I need to make sure to
figure out which are meninges

28:39.166 --> 28:40.532
and which are spinal nerves.

28:40.534 --> 28:43.601
The last thing I want to do
is nick a spinal nerve.

28:43.603 --> 28:44.903
[monitor beeps rapidly]

28:44.905 --> 28:46.371
Oh, baby's showing signs of distress.

28:46.373 --> 28:47.505
Heart rate's going up.

28:47.507 --> 28:48.873
Why? Dr. Hamza's being so careful.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.542
It happens.
Baby's lost too much blood.

28:50.544 --> 28:51.876
He can't tolerate the surgery.

28:51.878 --> 28:53.812
Membranes are separating
from the uterine wall.

28:53.814 --> 28:56.414
Blood is pooling out of
the membrane and placenta.

28:56.416 --> 28:57.882
Okay. Everybody, please.
I need to concentrate.

28:57.884 --> 28:59.684
Just, please, quiet.

29:02.663 --> 29:05.432
- Hey, what's happening?
- Heart rate's bottoming out.

29:05.434 --> 29:06.900
Dr. Vrnasi:
She's having a placental abruption.

29:06.902 --> 29:08.335
I need to get in there. Let's go!

29:08.337 --> 29:10.437
- 6-0 sutures!
- Let's prep for baby.

29:10.439 --> 29:12.039
I'm going to extend the incision.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.907
Oh, you're going to deliver the baby?

29:13.909 --> 29:15.676
Without a placental connection
to the uterus,

29:15.678 --> 29:16.843
the baby can't survive.

29:16.845 --> 29:19.046
Page neonatal, get someone
down here yesterday!

29:19.048 --> 29:20.347
- Damn it!
- Scissors.

29:20.349 --> 29:21.715
He's barely viable.

29:21.717 --> 29:23.083
The NICU is his best shot

29:23.085 --> 29:25.052
if he wants to keep staying viable.

29:25.054 --> 29:28.288
Okay. I am done.

29:28.290 --> 29:30.724
You don't need me anymore.

29:36.898 --> 29:39.666
Dev: As a resident,
you're gunning to operate solo,

29:39.668 --> 29:42.336
but I don't feel ready, I guess.

29:42.338 --> 29:45.439
Guess I keep imagining Dr. Harris...

29:45.441 --> 29:48.609
walking out and me by myself.

29:48.611 --> 29:50.277
[clears throat]

29:50.279 --> 29:53.580
Uh, I'm sorry. My throat's
a little dry. Do you mind?

29:56.417 --> 29:59.987
Woman: You consider Dr. Harris a mentor?

29:59.989 --> 30:01.755
I did. I do.

30:01.757 --> 30:03.223
All due respect,

30:03.225 --> 30:05.859
what kind of mentor abandons
his junior resident

30:05.861 --> 30:07.394
in the middle of a surgery?

30:10.798 --> 30:12.265
A crap one.

30:12.267 --> 30:13.634
Crace: Dr. Harris!

30:13.636 --> 30:15.836
Woman: We haven't conducted
all of our interviews yet.

30:15.838 --> 30:17.971
You will be able to make a statement
when we've finished here.

30:17.973 --> 30:20.974
Well, let me save you the time.
[exhales slowly]

30:20.976 --> 30:22.909
I quit.

30:22.911 --> 30:24.911
[scoffs]

30:25.880 --> 30:30.584
Oh, Charlie, what have you done?

30:30.586 --> 30:32.586
You know, Amos,

30:32.588 --> 30:36.456
I'm tired of convincing people
that I'm not crazy.

30:36.458 --> 30:42.896
I'm, uh, tired of helping people
that no one else can see.

30:42.898 --> 30:45.832
Basically, I'm tired.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.468
Ever since the day I was shot,

30:48.470 --> 30:52.372
which is a memorable day for me,
I've been stuck here.

30:52.374 --> 30:55.676
I couldn't help him... my patient,

30:55.678 --> 30:59.780
who had a gun
stuffed down his throat.

30:59.782 --> 31:02.182
And then I met you, and I thought,

31:02.184 --> 31:04.951
"Maybe he's my chance
to make up for it,"

31:04.953 --> 31:07.054
"to move on."

31:07.056 --> 31:09.556
Sorry to disappoint you.

31:09.558 --> 31:11.558
Well, I haven't given up on you,

31:11.560 --> 31:13.827
even if you have given up on yourself.

31:13.829 --> 31:15.028
[sighs]

31:15.030 --> 31:17.397
When was the first time
you felt like this?

31:17.399 --> 31:19.132
[scoffs]

31:19.134 --> 31:22.102
The first time you felt
your world move sideways

31:22.104 --> 31:24.237
like nothing made sense anymore?

31:24.239 --> 31:26.873
I don't know. I-I...

31:26.875 --> 31:29.142
When my parents died.

31:29.144 --> 31:30.444
Yeah. That makes sense.

31:30.446 --> 31:33.680
And how old were you at the time?

31:37.618 --> 31:41.455
Around the same age
as that boy that you found?

31:42.690 --> 31:44.558
Yeah.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.193
And how did your parents die?

31:47.528 --> 31:50.130
It was a car accident.

31:50.132 --> 31:52.099
And that was your fault.

31:52.101 --> 31:53.467
What?

31:53.469 --> 31:55.802
I've read all your files, Charlie.

31:55.804 --> 31:57.871
I've read Dr. Murphy's files.

31:57.873 --> 31:59.172
I know what happened.

31:59.174 --> 32:01.541
I know you were in the car at the time.

32:01.543 --> 32:03.176
And what were you doing?

32:03.178 --> 32:04.778
What was I doing?

32:04.780 --> 32:07.614
I was doing little kid stuff
in the back seat.

32:07.616 --> 32:10.217
I was... I was... I was playing.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.519
Playing. That's what kids do.
Nothing wrong with that.

32:12.521 --> 32:14.054
Right.

32:14.056 --> 32:17.791
Man: It's like this guy
is driving a tractor.

32:17.793 --> 32:19.092
Woman: There's no room.

32:19.094 --> 32:20.427
- Dad, slow down!
- Hold on.

32:20.429 --> 32:22.395
- There's no room.
- Daddy! Please!

32:22.397 --> 32:24.397
[screaming, horn blares, crashing]

32:24.399 --> 32:25.932
You dropped your toy car,

32:25.934 --> 32:28.635
and your father turned to see
what was wrong

32:28.637 --> 32:30.070
and was distracted,

32:30.072 --> 32:32.706
and that's what caused the accident.

32:32.708 --> 32:35.742
That's what you think happened.

32:35.744 --> 32:39.012
That's what you've been carrying
all these years.

32:42.049 --> 32:44.518
I did this to myself.

32:47.155 --> 32:49.289
All of this.

32:49.291 --> 32:54.394
You've seen the spirit world
growing darker, haven't you?

32:54.396 --> 32:55.862
I'm part of that.

32:55.864 --> 32:58.131
And why do you think that is?

32:58.133 --> 33:00.534
You can stop it.

33:00.536 --> 33:05.238
So, stop it. Push the darkness back.

33:07.241 --> 33:09.409
You've got to forgive yourself.

33:09.411 --> 33:10.710
Forgive yourself, Charlie.

33:10.712 --> 33:15.582
N-No. No! They should be alive!

33:16.784 --> 33:20.053
All your life, Charlie, you've
been surrounded by death,

33:20.055 --> 33:22.956
and it's still coming for you.

33:22.958 --> 33:25.892
Now might be your only chance.

33:25.894 --> 33:27.761
Now's the time to let it go.

33:27.763 --> 33:31.364
But...

33:31.366 --> 33:33.800
[voice breaking]
Then I'll have to let <i>them</i> go.

33:36.037 --> 33:38.138
Nothing's ever lost, Charlie.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.840
[scoffs]

33:39.842 --> 33:43.276
[echoing]
Haven't you learned that by now?

33:48.516 --> 33:50.917
I'm late. Have you
talked to them already?

33:50.919 --> 33:53.153
I-I went to the boardroom.
Where are they?

33:53.155 --> 33:56.022
Alex, I... I quit.

33:56.024 --> 33:58.325
What?

33:58.327 --> 34:02.462
I, um, I resigned...

34:02.464 --> 34:05.131
right before Sekara threw up.

34:05.133 --> 34:07.400
I don't... I don't understand, Charlie.

34:07.402 --> 34:09.636
Why would you do something like that?

34:12.106 --> 34:15.876
You can't understand.

34:15.878 --> 34:19.713
Actually, I-I can after today.

34:19.715 --> 34:21.681
Trust me.

34:21.683 --> 34:23.416
It makes sense now
more than it ever has,

34:23.418 --> 34:24.818
and I was going to go in there,

34:24.820 --> 34:27.120
and I was going to tell them
that if they got rid of you,

34:27.121 --> 34:31.224
Charlie, they would be getting
rid of something amazing.

34:31.226 --> 34:34.293
You help people more
than any other doctor can.

34:36.163 --> 34:38.130
I mean, look... look at these files.

34:38.132 --> 34:40.567
What is it, five years?
Maybe 20 miracle saves.

34:40.569 --> 34:43.303
You should be getting a medal,
not losing your job.

34:43.304 --> 34:45.538
Why would you ever quit
doing what you do?

34:47.975 --> 34:49.976
Wow!

34:49.978 --> 34:53.246
Where were you 20 minutes ago?

34:54.949 --> 34:59.552
Wherever you go, I think I went there.

34:59.554 --> 35:03.290
And I think that I finally understand

35:03.292 --> 35:05.392
how difficult this must be for you,

35:05.394 --> 35:06.793
to be torn, to try to...

35:06.795 --> 35:08.728
try to help these people.

35:12.099 --> 35:14.601
Charlie, I am so sorry.

35:14.603 --> 35:17.604
I am so sorry that I was not
there for you,

35:17.606 --> 35:19.239
that I wasn't with you.

35:19.241 --> 35:20.740
But I'm here. I'm here now.

35:20.742 --> 35:22.309
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:26.113 --> 35:28.949
I think...

35:28.951 --> 35:31.217
we're gonna be okay.

35:34.055 --> 35:36.289
I know we will.

35:38.326 --> 35:39.526
[sighs]

35:39.528 --> 35:41.528
Screw that curse.

35:46.181 --> 35:48.799
[creaking]

35:48.801 --> 35:51.369
[sighs]

35:51.371 --> 35:52.970
Cassie.

35:52.972 --> 35:56.440
The package of yours...
it's squeaking or whistling.

35:56.442 --> 35:58.442
Who?

35:58.444 --> 36:00.493
The box. It's alive.

36:00.531 --> 36:02.371
Whatever it is, could you please
get it out of here?

36:02.447 --> 36:03.981
Thank you.

36:15.695 --> 36:18.129
[cellphone rings]

36:25.971 --> 36:29.974
So? What's going on with you?
What's the matter?

36:29.976 --> 36:31.776
My chili's gone.

36:31.778 --> 36:33.945
About why you didn't want
to operate earlier.

36:33.947 --> 36:35.480
Who did you make a promise to

36:35.482 --> 36:37.816
that you wouldn't do
pediatric surgeries anymore?

36:37.818 --> 36:39.951
Oh. Myself.

36:39.953 --> 36:41.586
You were outstanding today.

36:41.588 --> 36:44.456
I lost a patient a month ago.

36:44.458 --> 36:46.524
A young girl.

36:46.526 --> 36:51.663
And, seeing her parents,
they lost their daughter.

36:51.665 --> 36:53.798
It really affected me in a way
I didn't like.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.867
Stop it. Give me a break.

36:55.869 --> 36:57.802
It's gonna be hell. I'm not gonna lie.

36:57.804 --> 36:59.304
But you're a great surgeon,

36:59.306 --> 37:01.506
and you're going to be a great father,

37:01.508 --> 37:03.374
and all at the same time, all right?

37:03.376 --> 37:05.810
Agree with me.

37:05.812 --> 37:07.879
I'll try.

37:07.881 --> 37:09.581
Believe it.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.416
Just believe it.

37:11.418 --> 37:13.318
Okay.

37:14.887 --> 37:16.020
Okay.

37:17.623 --> 37:20.959
Two... and three.

37:20.961 --> 37:24.696
Dr. Hamza. And you must be Dr. Vrnasi.

37:24.698 --> 37:26.431
I heard about the incredible surgery

37:26.433 --> 37:27.632
you guys pulled off today.

37:27.634 --> 37:28.933
Yeah, we did.

37:28.935 --> 37:30.735
Ugh, I don't want to hear about it.

37:30.737 --> 37:32.337
Oh, I'm just kidding.

37:32.339 --> 37:34.939
I want to hear all of it.
Tell me everything.

37:34.941 --> 37:36.274
- Drinks?
- [sighs]

37:36.276 --> 37:37.909
One for every patient I had today

37:37.911 --> 37:40.311
that had something stuck
in a place it shouldn't be.

37:40.313 --> 37:42.514
- Don't ask.
- Did you hear?

37:43.582 --> 37:44.682
Dr. Harris quit.

37:44.684 --> 37:47.185
Yeah. Weird day.

37:47.187 --> 37:49.120
I blame the balloons.

37:49.122 --> 37:50.455
Why would you send me those?

37:50.457 --> 37:52.056
What? Send you what?

37:52.058 --> 37:53.792
The...

37:53.794 --> 37:56.227
Wait. So, you didn't send me
this, either?

37:56.229 --> 37:59.597
Please. I wasn't <i>that</i> into you.

37:59.599 --> 38:01.800
So, what's in it?

38:01.802 --> 38:04.235
I don't know. I'm afraid to open it.

38:04.237 --> 38:05.370
I'm not.

38:05.372 --> 38:06.337
[pen clicks]

38:11.944 --> 38:13.111
Love note.

38:13.113 --> 38:15.413
What the...?

38:15.415 --> 38:18.783
"I can adapt and be whoever
you want me to be."

38:18.785 --> 38:21.586
Isn't it supposed to be "whomever"?

38:21.588 --> 38:22.687
[chuckles]

38:22.689 --> 38:25.323
Adapt.

38:25.325 --> 38:26.925
L
