00:04.500 --> 00:06.180
Excuse us.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.590
Uh,the 911 caller said the south tower.

00:12.610 --> 00:15.520
Right. Which you get to from the central plaza on the third floor.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.710
No. You cross around the corridor.

00:17.730 --> 00:18.600
Well,you know what?

00:18.620 --> 00:21.070
We'll just see who gets there first.

Proudly Presents

00:44.660 --> 00:46.770
There's no reason for you to have called the police.

00:46.790 --> 00:49.830
I called the police because no one can explain what happened to my son.

00:49.860 --> 00:50.870
Ms. Langner,please.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.080
Let me get you a grief counselor.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.430
I don't need a grief counselor!

00:54.460 --> 00:56.300
I want those doctors arrested.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.080
Let's discuss this in my office.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.090
Detective daniels,lapd.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.300
Priority homicide.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.640
Help mE.

01:02.670 --> 01:05.290
They murdered my son.

01:08.990 --> 01:10.940
Ok,just take a breath.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.660
Take a breath.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.450
Ok?

01:18.900 --> 01:21.590
So,what's going on here?

01:23.870 --> 01:29.070
I brought my son nicky in for a simple endoscopy.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.500
And now he's dead.

01:32.220 --> 01:33.850
They killed him.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.560
Detective. If I may.

01:38.790 --> 01:43.640
There's no question that we've had a terrible tragedy here tonight.

01:43.890 --> 01:46.510
But the presence of police...

01:46.530 --> 01:49.880
it just seems to be inflaming the situation.

01:49.930 --> 01:53.310
It might be best for everyone if you just went home.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.280
I'm sorry.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.200
You do not tell the lapd to go home.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.810
Detective,please.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.080
Don't overreact to this situation.

02:03.150 --> 02:06.730
It is common to hear accusations like this from people who have lost children.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.970
But I can assure you,

02:07.990 --> 02:11.750
the doctors took all heroic measures to save the boy's life.

02:11.770 --> 02:14.380
I'd like to hear that from them.

02:14.490 --> 02:18.020
Dr. Woods and dr. Sands are unavailable.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.990
Since you refuse to cooperate,

02:23.030 --> 02:25.760
and I have reasonable suspicion regarding this attended death--

02:25.780 --> 02:26.520
reasonable suspicion?

02:26.540 --> 02:29.150
I am designating the O. R. A crime scene.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.480
No one touches the body.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.930
Nothing is disturbed or removed.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.500
Please secure the operating suite.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.040
Let's go.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.510
Sorry to pull you guys away from dinner.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.850
The speeches were endless.The food never came.

03:07.870 --> 03:09.450
I was about to eat my napkin.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.360
What's going on here?
Well,we have a problem.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.410
The mother over here,melissa langner,

03:13.440 --> 03:16.550
her son nicky came in for a routine procedure.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.290
Are you in charge?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.020
Talk to the lady.

03:20.050 --> 03:22.340
Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.I'll be with you in a minute,sir.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.470
Go on.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.990
So,her son,went through surgery to stop some minor gastric bleeding,

03:28.010 --> 03:30.750
there were some complications,he died,

03:30.770 --> 03:34.030
and now she's saying that he was murdered.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.140
Ok.

03:37.170 --> 03:37.930
Thank you,sergeant.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.400
And you are?
Howard pierce.

03:39.430 --> 03:42.290
Administrative director of southwest pacific university hospital.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.820
One of your people has shutdown our operating room.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.670
That was daniels' call before I got here.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.330
Ok.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.580
I'd be happy to address your concerns as soon as I get more information.

03:52.610 --> 03:54.380
One moment,please.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.720
Oh,excuse me.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.950
This is the woman I was speaking of.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.550
Ms. Langner.

04:00.770 --> 04:04.600
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the lapd.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.410
I'm sorry to press you at a time like this,

04:07.430 --> 04:11.030
but I need to know why you think your son was murdered.

04:13.630 --> 04:16.990
Nicky started throwing up around 6:15.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.209
There was a little blood.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.649
I'm a fourth year medical student.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.610
I knew it probably wasn't anything too serious,

04:23.640 --> 04:27.230
but I didn't want to misdiagnose him so I brought him here

04:27.260 --> 04:29.760
so that they could scope him.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.310
10 minutes later,he was in major surgerY.

04:35.780 --> 04:39.140
20 minutes later,he was dead.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.030
That's A...

04:41.490 --> 04:43.550
that is a terrible story,ms. Langner,

04:43.570 --> 04:46.360
but what makes you think it was a crime?

04:47.380 --> 04:49.210
Because...

04:49.390 --> 04:51.870
when I questioned dr. Woods,

04:51.910 --> 04:53.590
the vascular surgeon,

04:53.620 --> 04:55.570
about the cause of death,

04:55.600 --> 04:57.650
he kept changing his answer.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.250
And after the third response,

05:00.280 --> 05:05.100
he just looked at the other doctor,the G.I. Specialist...

05:05.340 --> 05:08.280
and I saw it in their eyes.

05:08.870 --> 05:12.140
They are covering something up.

05:12.230 --> 05:12.900
Ms. Langner...

05:12.920 --> 05:14.800
please...

05:14.930 --> 05:16.840
help me.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.450
Please?

05:25.870 --> 05:28.280
Ok. I'll be right back.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.210
I hope that we are acting on good solid suspicions and not just sympathy.

05:33.240 --> 05:39.150
Chief,I initiated this investigation because I was being actively obstructed.

06:13.250 --> 06:17.200
could the bruises be from how he was handled during surgery?

06:17.250 --> 06:18.200
No.

06:18.230 --> 06:19.090
I doubt it.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.640
The yellowing suggests they happened much earlier.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.890
Is that a video camera?

06:40.190 --> 06:44.580
You should know as soon as your grieving mother went to the bathroom,those guys appeared.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.900
They've been huddling.

06:46.930 --> 06:50.050
Looks like they're planning their next play.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.060
And they are leaving.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.740
I don't think they're a flight risk.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.550
Mr. Pierce,I believe we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.280
I'm confident that with your cooperation,

07:04.300 --> 07:06.220
we can resolve this issue right noW.
I agree.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.740
All I need is the surgery video,the boy's charts,

07:08.770 --> 07:10.440
and to have a short conversation with the physicians.

07:10.470 --> 07:12.430
Well,that's not going to happen.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.150
Excuse me?

07:13.170 --> 07:15.200
You want to resolve this quickly,let me help you.

07:15.230 --> 07:19.950
There...was...no...murder.

07:20.020 --> 07:24.820
You need to turn that operating suite back over to us right now.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.400
Sergeant gabriel,please notify building operations that we'll be shutting down this floor.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.510
Nothing goes in or out without our permission.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.560
Nothing.
You can't do that!

07:34.580 --> 07:35.490
One more word out of you,

07:35.510 --> 07:40.880
and I will padlock this entire hospital and arrest you for interfering with a murder investigation.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.670
We don't know there was malpractice.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.560
Much less a crime,much less murder.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.260
So let's be clear about what's going on here.

07:52.290 --> 07:58.480
You're launching a full-fledged investigation into a nationally respected hospital based on the hunch of a hysterical woman.

07:58.510 --> 08:01.730
Daniels and I both felt she might be telling the truth.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.940
Ok. Make that three hysterical women.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.160
I know you don't want me to respond to that.

08:07.200 --> 08:13.390
No. What it looks like to me is a grieving mother desperate to pin the blame for her son's death on somebody.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.510
Ever consider she might be pinning it on those responsible?

08:16.510 --> 08:19.320
Todd woods is one of the top vascular surgeons in the country.

08:19.340 --> 08:22.870
What possible motive could he or this other doctor have for murdering an 8-year-old boy?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.260
Well,then,if there's no issue,

08:24.280 --> 08:25.540
why won't this mr. Pierce,

08:25.560 --> 08:28.300
this jerk of a hospital administrator help me?

08:28.330 --> 08:33.380
Brenda,just because somebody doesn't share your agenda doesn't make them a jerk.

08:35.210 --> 08:39.270
Dr. Woods was decorated for his work as a trauma surgeon during the first gulf war.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.770
He pioneered the use of carotid stents.

08:41.789 --> 08:45.380
Dr. Sands has performed over 2,000 endoscopic procedures.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.460
He's been recognized--thank you. I get it.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.380
The attending physicians are geniuses.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.210
Now,like chief johnson,

08:50.240 --> 08:54.860
I am committed to resolving this with the least inconvenience for all involved.

08:54.890 --> 08:57.150
Then end the criminal inquiry.

08:57.180 --> 09:00.330
If ms. Langner continues to harbor doubts about her son's treatment,

09:00.350 --> 09:02.860
she has numerous civil remedies available to her.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.020
We are asking for minimal cooperation.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.840
And I am telling you that these doctors' records are protected,

09:07.870 --> 09:11.280
and they will remain confidential.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.580
And let me give you a word of warning,sir,

09:13.610 --> 09:18.140
the legal principals at stake in this case are more important than you seem to imagine.

09:18.140 --> 09:23.790
Now I urge you to think very carefully about what you do next.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.650
Martha,get me martin garnett,please.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.820
Thank you.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.330
Garnett's the deputy district attorney.

09:34.340 --> 09:39.190
I'm gonna ask him to have the grand jury issue subpoenas for everything related to the langner case.

09:39.220 --> 09:44.740
Just to satisfy my own stupid,uninformed curiosity.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.770
There's no reason to involve a grand jury.

09:54.030 --> 09:58.580
I can arrange for the doctors to speak with you and for the hospital to turn over the video.

09:58.610 --> 10:00.430
But the charts remain sealed.

10:00.460 --> 10:01.250
That's better.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.650
And how long will this take?

10:02.680 --> 10:03.940
I hope we don't need to make an appointment.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.100
I'll be back in 2 hours.

10:05.130 --> 10:05.940
Excellent.

10:05.970 --> 10:08.680
Thank you.Thank you so much.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.040
Wow. The motto is first do no harm.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.480
They should add,second,don't be so obnoxious.

10:15.510 --> 10:18.350
You realize that by limiting the information they turn over,

10:18.370 --> 10:20.080
they're trying to guide our conclusions.

10:20.110 --> 10:22.020
You're welcome,brenda.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.200
Thank you.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.530
As you can see,there was already significant bleeding when I began the egd.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.360
The egd?

10:31.380 --> 10:33.780
Esophago-gastro duodenoscopy.

10:33.800 --> 10:40.850
It's when the doctors slide the scope down the patient's throat to get a visualization of the upper gastro intestinal tract.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.200
What causes this kind of bleeding?

10:43.220 --> 10:44.900
Hematemesis.Vomiting blood.

10:44.930 --> 10:48.440
It can be caused by gastritis,or in rare cases,mallory-weiss tears.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.190
Which are?

10:49.220 --> 10:53.240
Burst blood vessels in the mucosa of the esophagus.

10:53.270 --> 10:55.930
I did a year in medical school.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.350
Cauterization should reduce that bleeding,

10:59.380 --> 11:01.640
but 3 minutes into the procedure,

11:01.670 --> 11:04.460
the patient's blood pressure dropped to 60 over 30,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.510
began transfusing with o-negative.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.410
And called for surgical back-up.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.050
I arrived less than 10 minutes later,

11:10.080 --> 11:12.390
and performed an emergency laparotomy.

11:12.420 --> 11:16.610
Exploring the abdominal cavity for hemorrhage.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.360
At 19:16,the patient coded.

11:19.380 --> 11:23.260
At 19:19,I discovered a bleed in the left gastric artery.

11:23.290 --> 11:26.370
As I began suturing this perforation,

11:26.390 --> 11:29.240
the patient flatlined.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.130
Had no meaningful heart function for 3 minutes.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.800
Despite closing this rupture,

11:34.840 --> 11:38.870
the patient's diastolic pressure never rose above 20 millimeters.

11:38.910 --> 11:42.900
Repeated attempts to establish a normal sinus rhythm failed,

11:42.930 --> 11:47.100
and we pronounced the patient dead at 19:31.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.680
Thank you,buzz.

11:49.730 --> 11:52.800
If you were to review your charts with our forensic pathologists,

11:52.830 --> 11:57.630
would they be entirely consistent with what you just told us?

11:57.920 --> 11:58.810
No.

11:58.830 --> 12:02.750
No. The charts would indicate something significant beyond that.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.840
Over the past 6 months,

12:03.880 --> 12:12.750
melissa langner brought her son to the E.R. Repeatedly with complaints ranging from allergies to asthma to acute gastric distress.

12:12.770 --> 12:16.710
The exact cause of these various ailments remains undetermined,

12:16.730 --> 12:20.250
but they share one common element.

12:20.950 --> 12:24.470
They all could've been artificially induced.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.510
And as you saw last night,

12:25.540 --> 12:28.080
melissa langner is emotionally unstable.

12:28.110 --> 12:31.560
Are you suggesting melissa langner deliberately made her son sick?

12:31.600 --> 12:32.900
I am.

12:32.930 --> 12:39.160
And the treating physicians thought this might be a case of munchausen's by proxy and so listed it on the boy's charts.

12:39.210 --> 12:45.690
Doctors woods and sands were concerned that bringing these allegations to your attention would needlessly complicate a tragedy.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.940
But if you're certain this is murder,

12:47.970 --> 12:52.550
then I'd consider melissa langner a serious suspect.

12:56.300 --> 13:00.170
Thank you so much for coming in on such a sad day.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.640
Do you have someone staying with you?

13:02.680 --> 13:06.660
No,but I-- I'm managing.

13:07.530 --> 13:11.290
Thank you for fol--following...

13:11.330 --> 13:13.010
through on this.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.960
Well,we are committed to discovering exactly what happened to nicholas.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.870
I don't believe you've met lieutenant tao.

13:21.810 --> 13:23.870
My condolences.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.350
Ms. Langner,this morning,

13:28.370 --> 13:31.310
dr. Woods and dr. Sands gave their statements,

13:31.350 --> 13:34.130
and they maintain your son died from severe internal bleeding.

13:34.150 --> 13:38.360
Despite dr. Woods having closed a perforation in the left gastric artery.

13:38.380 --> 13:39.690
Have you seen the charts yet?

13:39.710 --> 13:40.370
We haven't,

13:40.390 --> 13:45.940
but we've been assured there's nothing in there that would contradict the video of your son's surgery.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.460
I'm sorry to ask you questions on such a hard day,

13:49.480 --> 13:53.270
but we were also told that in recent months,

13:53.330 --> 13:56.420
nicky's made approximately a dozen trips to the E.R.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.160
Is that true?

14:00.610 --> 14:04.350
Nicky had always been a healthy kid.

14:04.530 --> 14:07.460
And then his dad died last july,

14:07.480 --> 14:10.590
it was totally unexpected.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.550
Oh,my.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.870
So nicky is the second family member you've lost in a year?

14:16.910 --> 14:18.970
That's so unfortunate.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.140
After my husband died,I was almost suicidal.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.030
I'm so sorry.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.880
Have you been talking to anyone about this?

14:25.900 --> 14:31.840
Yes. And with antidepressants,things improved,

14:31.870 --> 14:35.270
but nicky,suddenly,he was sick.

14:35.290 --> 14:36.210
All the time.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.420
It was like he picked up every germ.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.300
The flu,the chicken pox.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.670
Yesterday,he was vomiting blood.

14:47.750 --> 14:51.680
Do you have any idea what might have caused your son to throw up?

14:59.970 --> 15:03.640
There are a hundred different physical reasons.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.620
Or it could've been a lot of stress.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.170
Losing his dad,being in a new school.

15:10.950 --> 15:15.640
Was nicky being treated for anything that might have affected his motor coordination?

15:15.670 --> 15:19.180
No. Why?

15:19.450 --> 15:21.440
Well,when we examined nicholas,

15:21.470 --> 15:24.290
he seemed to have several bruises.

15:24.420 --> 15:28.630
Was he bumping into objects or falling down a lot?

15:30.870 --> 15:34.710
How else do you think he might have sustained those injuries?

15:39.860 --> 15:43.230
Are you suggesting I hurt nicky?

15:43.250 --> 15:44.800
We have to consider all the possibilities.

15:44.830 --> 15:49.320
That...isn'T...a possibility.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.930
That is an insult.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.480
My son was everything to me.

15:55.640 --> 15:59.480
Do you really believe I would have hit him?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.370
Do you?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.400
Maybe not hit him,but hurt him.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.100
Doctors have access to things that can make children sick,

16:06.120 --> 16:08.180
and you're a medical student.

16:08.270 --> 16:14.670
Well,thank you for your commitment to finding out what happened,ms. JohnsoN.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.590
But I won't be needing your help anymore.

16:18.330 --> 16:20.060
Mrs. Langner.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.000
We have to help.

16:24.030 --> 16:26.700
Whether you like it or not.

16:35.330 --> 16:38.920
Last 10 years,I've worked 3 cases of munchausen by proxy.

16:38.950 --> 16:42.950
Mothers are supposed to be making their kids sick to get sympathy for themselves.

16:42.990 --> 16:43.940
It's bullshit.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.050
Really?

16:45.070 --> 16:49.510
And what about all the surveillance tapes of parents overdosing their kids and smothering them with pillows.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.980
Hey,I'm not saying it never happens.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.540
But every case I saw,

16:53.560 --> 16:56.310
there was always a sick kid,a pain in the ass mom,

16:56.330 --> 16:58.670
and a doctor who wanted them both to disappear.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.450
Easiest way to accomplish that is say the word munchausen.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.339
Ok,lieutenant flynn,we appreciate your perspective,

17:04.369 --> 17:07.790
but as you are our resident expert in munchausen's by proxy...

17:07.819 --> 17:09.650
you want the profile,fine.

17:09.670 --> 17:14.250
The fbi says that the vast majority of munchausen perpetrators are women.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.040
80 percent have medical background,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.030
and most are under psychiatric treatment.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.829
So far we're batting a thousand.Anything else?

17:21.220 --> 17:28.210
Parent tends to keep their child from other adults and away from outside activities like playing with other kids.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.750
Do we know anything about nicholas langner's extended family?

17:31.770 --> 17:33.100
School friends,anything?

17:33.130 --> 17:37.630
Nicky attended robert hutchins academy.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.870
It's an expensive private school,

17:39.890 --> 17:41.250
and the teacher said he's intelligent,

17:41.290 --> 17:42.780
hardworking,shy.

17:42.810 --> 17:44.170
One last thing,chief.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.680
When munchausen happens among medical people,

17:46.710 --> 17:50.650
it's to cause illness then save the kid to impress other doctors.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.460
An added incentive for melissa langner.

17:53.540 --> 17:58.150
The doctors treating her son were the same ones she'd have for medical rotations.

17:58.180 --> 18:00.920
Whatever happened to good old fashioned brown-nosing?

18:00.960 --> 18:02.870
Except she didn't save the kid,did she?

18:02.900 --> 18:05.200
Preliminary autopsy report.

18:05.230 --> 18:08.650
Nicholas langner died from massive internal bleeding.

18:08.680 --> 18:13.440
Dr. Crippen found 3 prescription drugs in his system all within acceptable levels,

18:13.450 --> 18:17.750
and none could've acted with that specificity on his gastric artery.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.020
Ok,lieutenant provenza,

18:20.030 --> 18:22.540
please get a warrant and search melissa langner's house.

18:22.560 --> 18:29.060
Keep a special eye out for any substances that might not have shown up in her son's blood work but could've made him sick.

18:29.090 --> 18:30.150
Lieutenant flynn,

18:30.180 --> 18:32.310
please keep looking for langner relatives.

18:32.350 --> 18:33.180
Sergeant gabriel,

18:33.200 --> 18:37.240
I think we ought to find out if nick langner played well with others.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.060
What's the name of his school again?

18:39.150 --> 18:42.010
Many of these kids haven't even lost a pet.

18:42.030 --> 18:45.340
Imagine trying to explain the death of a classmate.

18:45.370 --> 18:48.250
My nicky was such a special little boy.

18:48.380 --> 18:51.780
Did you have much interaction with his mother?

18:52.240 --> 18:54.010
In 25 years of teaching,

18:54.040 --> 18:57.330
I've dealt with a lot of overprotective parents,

18:57.350 --> 19:00.820
but they pale in comparison to melissa langner.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.640
What do you mean by that?

19:02.930 --> 19:06.330
Well,for example,when nicky first arrived,

19:06.360 --> 19:09.400
he was placed with one of our younger instructors.

19:09.420 --> 19:12.290
But ms. Langner reduced her to tears so often,

19:12.330 --> 19:14.350
and with so many accusations of carelessness,

19:14.390 --> 19:18.140
that I moved him into my own class.

19:18.230 --> 19:19.530
As we discussed,

19:19.560 --> 19:23.390
nicky hadn't been here very long,and he was shy.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.860
Tyler crosby wasn't just his best friend,

19:25.890 --> 19:27.840
he was his only friend.

19:27.870 --> 19:31.000
I've gotten permission from tyler's mother to have him speak with you,

19:31.030 --> 19:34.930
but,of course,you will be sensitive to what he's going through.

19:34.950 --> 19:36.150
Absolutely,ma'am.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.530
Of course.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.150
Tyler.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.550
I'm brenda leigh johnson.

19:41.590 --> 19:43.400
Do you know why I'm here?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.450
Nicky.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.960
That's right.

19:46.010 --> 19:49.090
We're here to talk about your friend.

19:50.870 --> 19:54.490
It's hard when someone you care about passes away.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.140
I'm sorry.

19:56.170 --> 19:57.860
I didn't mean to.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.570
I didn'T.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.730
I was only playing.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.050
You didn't mean to what?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.990
I didn't mean to kill him.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.430
I'm sorry.

20:09.450 --> 20:11.590
Please don't arrest me.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.870
Why--why do you think you killed him?

20:13.910 --> 20:16.910
His mom said not to wrestle.

20:17.070 --> 20:19.170
He wanted to.

20:19.430 --> 20:20.640
He came at me.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.750
He made me.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.260
What--what did you do?

20:25.310 --> 20:29.000
I turned him over and I held him down.

20:29.390 --> 20:32.130
But he was laughing.

20:33.790 --> 20:36.680
I didn't mean to hurt him.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.410
Please don't tell nicky's mom.

20:40.430 --> 20:43.100
Please,I'm afraid of her.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.310
Did nicky's mom threaten you?

20:46.350 --> 20:49.340
Yeah. Yeah,she warned me.

20:49.450 --> 20:51.900
She warned me not to hurt him.

21:02.790 --> 21:08.710
Langner's house has padding on every table corner and covers on all the electrical outlets.

21:09.080 --> 21:12.850
I'm telling you,this is a mom who wanted to build a giant bubble around her kid.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.510
All the medicine cabinets are full of vitamins.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.410
Not to mention 3 half empty bottles of ipecac.

21:18.430 --> 21:19.430
That induces vomiting.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.960
You do that enough,and anybody's insides will start to bleed.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.810
Chief,I found melissa langner's in-laws in...

21:26.270 --> 21:27.970
rancho palos verdes.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.240
Beverly and walter langner.

21:30.270 --> 21:32.910
They're in your office,and they want to talk.

21:32.950 --> 21:33.790
Ok.

21:34.340 --> 21:37.100
We are both...

21:37.360 --> 21:39.630
horrified by nicky's death.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.920
But not completely surprised.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.280
This past year...

21:44.760 --> 21:47.930
since our son died so unexpectedly,

21:47.950 --> 21:50.130
melissa's become increasingly...

21:50.160 --> 21:51.170
well...

21:51.180 --> 21:52.720
paranoid.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.120
She refused to let us near nicky.

21:55.150 --> 22:00.660
We had to sue her to get limited visitation with our own grandson.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.990
It's so embarrassing.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.920
What reasons did she give the judge for denying you visits?

22:05.950 --> 22:10.020
She claimed that nicky was too sick to spend time away from home.

22:10.040 --> 22:15.090
And that my occasional cigar at dinner posed an unreasonable health risk.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.160
If he was sickly,

22:16.180 --> 22:18.940
it was only because melissa made him that way.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.550
But I don't blame her alone.

22:21.580 --> 22:25.070
That boyfriend of hers played a part in this.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.560
Um,you didn't mention a boyfriend.

22:27.590 --> 22:29.980
A couple of months after our son died,

22:30.010 --> 22:32.750
she took up with this guy she dated in high school.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.550
Jason higgins.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.960
She never let us meet him,

22:35.990 --> 22:38.790
but the second that nicky told us about him,

22:38.820 --> 22:40.350
I had him checked out.

22:40.370 --> 22:42.140
He has an ex,

22:42.180 --> 22:43.220
he owes alimony,

22:43.240 --> 22:44.460
he owes child support,

22:44.490 --> 22:47.070
and there's a restraining order against him,too.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.590
Years back,we set up a trust for our son.

22:50.750 --> 22:56.500
And,uh... after he died,it passed on to our grandson,and...

22:56.530 --> 23:00.750
now that he's gone,too,that money,

23:00.770 --> 23:05.660
it's $3 million today,goes to melissa,

23:05.690 --> 23:12.000
and if she marries him,this jason higgins.

23:15.670 --> 23:17.080
According to langner's parents,

23:17.110 --> 23:18.870
higgins has anger issues,

23:18.890 --> 23:21.910
so we're gonna play good cop,bad cop.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.780
You're not gonna make me be the good cop,are you?

23:23.810 --> 23:25.780
I don't think that's possible,lieutenant.

23:25.810 --> 23:27.950
How bad do you want me to be?

23:28.090 --> 23:29.660
Go for broke.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.840
Mr. Higgins,deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the lapd.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.410
I just can't believe he's dead.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.730
I mean,the little guy got sick a lot,

23:40.750 --> 23:43.280
but I really thought he'd grow out of it.

23:43.310 --> 23:45.250
I was the same way when I was his age.

23:45.270 --> 23:46.580
Yeah,and look at you now.

23:46.610 --> 23:48.660
Easy,lieutenant.

23:48.850 --> 23:53.290
How would you describe melissa langner's behavior over the last several months?

23:54.120 --> 23:58.920
Melissa...and i have known each other since we were 15.

23:59.080 --> 24:03.640
She's always been,I don't know,tightly wound.

24:03.660 --> 24:06.170
And her husband goes and drops dead on his morning jog,

24:06.190 --> 24:09.760
I mean,that's enough to make anybody lose it a little bit.

24:09.770 --> 24:13.300
Do you believe melissa langner lost it?

24:13.600 --> 24:17.000
You think melissa had something to do with nicky's death?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.900
No way. Oh,no.

24:18.930 --> 24:20.410
Melissa's whole life was about nicky.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.670
She was totally obsessed with that kid.

24:23.750 --> 24:27.410
And how's your financial situation,mr. Higgins?

24:27.830 --> 24:29.250
Is this about my ex wife?

24:29.280 --> 24:30.510
'Cause I settled with her 3 months ago.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.020
And I've made every payment since then.

24:32.050 --> 24:33.530
I'll show you the cancelled checks if you want.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.790
Why,you got 'em on you?

24:34.830 --> 24:37.600
We understand your ex wife took out a restraining order on you.

24:37.630 --> 24:40.600
Yeah. Because she wouldn't tell me why she was leaving,

24:40.620 --> 24:41.530
and I got a little mad.

24:41.550 --> 24:43.230
I sense that.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.810
Did you ever get mad like that with nick?

24:45.860 --> 24:46.860
No!

24:47.260 --> 24:49.760
Do I look like the kind of guy who'd beat up on an 8-year-old kid?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.150
Are we talking boy or girl?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.040
Hey,screw you!

24:53.070 --> 24:54.390
Well,if that's an offer,

24:54.410 --> 24:56.180
you might be a little friendlier about it.

24:56.210 --> 24:57.370
Lieutenant.

24:57.410 --> 24:59.040
I asked you not to jump to conclusions.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.090
It could be that mr. Higgins here had nothing to do with this crime.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.550
When was the last time you saw nick langner?

25:04.580 --> 25:06.810
All of a sudden,I'm a suspect?

25:06.850 --> 25:11.180
I ain't seen nicky since last wednesday night when I broke up with melissa.

25:11.650 --> 25:13.360
You broke up with melissa langner?

25:13.400 --> 25:17.100
Why do you think I didn't know anything about what happened to nicky?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.330
I don't know,chief.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.660
If this guy didn't want the kid but wanted the money,

25:23.680 --> 25:24.880
why break up with her?

25:24.910 --> 25:26.370
Chief.

25:26.540 --> 25:27.650
This is something you should see.

25:27.690 --> 25:28.630
Geez,tao.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.140
I'm starting to think you enjoy looking at this stuff.

25:31.170 --> 25:33.330
These bruises are called purpura.

25:33.350 --> 25:37.640
They can be caused spontaneously by some blood clotting disorders.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.210
Are you suggesting maybe nobody hit nicky at all?

25:41.950 --> 25:46.940
Wouldn't a clotting disorder have been something that would've been diagnosed before surgery?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.420
Or could this have been artificially induced as well?

25:49.460 --> 25:53.360
I won't know for sure unless I have dr. Crippen re-examine the body.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.980
All right.

25:55.010 --> 25:58.240
Try and come back with a definite answer I can understand.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.900
And print outs.

25:59.930 --> 26:00.930
Chief.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.210
Pope's office just called.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.780
He needs to see you right away.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.640
chief johnson.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.360
I don't know if you heard,

26:17.390 --> 26:18.400
but a couple of nights ago,

26:18.420 --> 26:20.610
a lady was strangled to death on laurel canyon.

26:20.630 --> 26:22.810
An elderly woman living alone.

26:22.830 --> 26:24.680
Yeah. Right.

26:24.790 --> 26:25.620
And last night,

26:25.640 --> 26:28.160
there was another homicide just around the corner.

26:28.190 --> 26:29.430
Could be the start of a spree,

26:29.450 --> 26:32.760
so you understand why this investigation has picked up greater urgency.

26:32.790 --> 26:38.400
My detectives are already stretched a bit thin and since priority homicide isn't really doing much right now...

26:38.430 --> 26:41.660
I appreciate the gravity of the situation,commander,

26:41.690 --> 26:43.850
but as it so happens,we are busy.

26:43.870 --> 26:47.270
I'm close to resolving the nicholas langner investigatioN.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.450
Nicholas langner?

26:48.490 --> 26:49.880
The boy who died during surgery?

26:49.910 --> 26:52.260
Yes,this past day has opened up new leads.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.890
We are looking at a murder a night in the hollywood hills.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.580
One more,and this jumps to the papers and all hell breaks loose.

26:58.610 --> 27:01.270
Look,I have kids.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.180
And what happened to that boy is...

27:04.400 --> 27:06.220
I can't even think about it.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.610
It's every parent's worst nightmare.

27:08.650 --> 27:09.860
Is the mother suffering?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.600
Of course.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.720
Does that make it murder?

27:12.740 --> 27:13.210
No.

27:13.220 --> 27:15.090
Is it a case for priority homicide,

27:15.110 --> 27:16.260
absolutely not.

27:16.290 --> 27:19.040
It's not.It just is not.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.510
Now,get your people to robbery/homicide as soon as possible.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.570
If this is a spree killer,

27:23.580 --> 27:26.380
you could be taking over the case tonight.

27:27.510 --> 27:28.670
Ok,then.

27:28.710 --> 27:29.880
Thank you.

27:30.010 --> 27:31.310
Commander.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.340
So we're just gonna let it go.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.400
And we have to go to robbery/homicide.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.600
This is complete crap.

27:38.620 --> 27:39.790
We have momentum.

27:39.810 --> 27:41.730
We're getting close to something here.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.930
Uh,chief,it's lieutenant tao.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.990
He says it's urgent.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.680
Hold on a second.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.510
Chief johnson.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.600
Chief.We got a problem.

27:54.900 --> 27:58.110
The morgue released nicholas langner's body.

27:58.220 --> 28:01.650
All right. Well,get over to the funeral home before it gets cremated or embalmed.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.710
Well,that's the thing.

28:02.730 --> 28:05.570
Melissa langner didn't send the body to a funeral home.

28:05.590 --> 28:08.080
She released it to her medical school.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.670
Ok. Thank you,lieutenant tao.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.780
Lieutenant flynn and provenza.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.790
Please report to robbery/homicide and give detective ross a hand.

28:21.820 --> 28:22.950
Ross,huh? Yeah.

28:22.980 --> 28:23.960
I'll give him a hand all right.

28:23.990 --> 28:26.150
Sawed off little runt.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.640
what about me,chief?

28:31.670 --> 28:34.110
Yeah,you,too,sergeant gabriel.

28:37.380 --> 28:40.050
But on your way there...

28:40.370 --> 28:45.560
get the deputy da to convene a grand jury to subpoena nicky langner's hospital records.

28:45.710 --> 28:50.570
And also the doctor's schedules for last weekend,please.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.320
Thank you.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.510
Feel like driving,detective daniels?

29:00.540 --> 29:01.540
Where we going?

29:01.570 --> 29:03.260
Robbery/homicide.

29:03.560 --> 29:07.300
By way of southwest pacific university.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.520
Pardon me,ma'am.

29:11.540 --> 29:14.550
Can you tell me where the anatomy lab is?

29:15.330 --> 29:16.790
Thank you.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.390
my god.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.820
MrS. Langner.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.270
Wait until you see thiS.

30:01.850 --> 30:07.260
this is the subpoenaed paperwork for each of nicholas langner's 12 E.R. Visits.

30:07.290 --> 30:08.710
Please.

30:08.810 --> 30:12.020
Detective daniels and i have gone through all of them.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.220
Though the doctors said they'd be there,

30:14.250 --> 30:18.630
there is not a single notation on any of these charts indicating munchausen's by proxy.

30:18.660 --> 30:21.650
So the reason howard pierce threw out that misdirect?

30:22.250 --> 30:25.260
See what time dr. Sands ordered the cbc and chem panel?

30:25.280 --> 30:26.970
And look when he started the endoscopy.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.840
Now I've gone over these test results with forensics,

30:29.870 --> 30:33.150
cbc shows nicholas langner's platelet count at 5,000.

30:33.180 --> 30:35.850
About 4 percent of what it would be in a healthy kid.

30:35.880 --> 30:36.990
Help me,lieutenant tao.

30:37.020 --> 30:38.680
I have no idea what you're talking about.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.390
It means he developed a clotting disorder.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.960
He'd become sort of a hemophiliac.

30:43.980 --> 30:47.190
So a doctor shoves a scope down his throat,makes a tear,

30:47.220 --> 30:48.940
and the kid bleeds to death.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.900
How would he develop something like this?

30:50.920 --> 30:52.240
Is it an illness?

30:52.260 --> 30:55.040
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpora.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.970
I'm not even gonna try and pronounce that.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.470
Also known as itp.

30:59.500 --> 31:04.000
It was probably a temporary after effect of a viral infection like the chicken pox.

31:04.020 --> 31:06.770
Melissa langner said he contracted it a few months back.

31:06.790 --> 31:10.960
And a platelet count that low would've caused spontaneous bruising.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.560
So,in other words,maybe nobody hit him.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.030
Or maybe he wrestled when his mother told him not to.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.370
All right,then.

31:20.510 --> 31:21.620
Thank you.

31:21.750 --> 31:22.980
Good job.

31:31.510 --> 31:33.050
Have you looked at my camcorder tape?

31:33.080 --> 31:35.100
Not yet. I will.

31:36.850 --> 31:38.420
So,ms. Langner,I have to tell you,

31:38.450 --> 31:41.370
I have been a criminal investigator for almost 10 years.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.510
And I had a very interesting life before that,

31:43.520 --> 31:45.910
but this afternoon,that was a first for me.

31:45.950 --> 31:49.440
You have to look at the tape.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.430
I know you still think I had something to do with nicky's death.

31:53.470 --> 31:54.910
Well,what am i supposed to think?

31:54.930 --> 31:57.720
Your son contracts a serious of unexplained illnesses,

31:57.740 --> 32:00.740
you intimidate his teacher,his 9-year-old friend,his grandparents,

32:00.770 --> 32:02.260
and then,on top of everything else,

32:02.310 --> 32:07.010
you perform an unsanctioned dissection of the boy you say you loved.

32:07.050 --> 32:11.260
It was the only way to prove what I believed.

32:11.270 --> 32:14.320
And what your coroner should've discovered.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.830
Woods told you...

32:18.020 --> 32:20.660
he'd repaired the left gastric artery.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.090
He lied.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.180
Don't believe me.

32:28.070 --> 32:30.070
Look at the tape.

32:34.210 --> 32:36.600
I'm under the omentum.

32:37.290 --> 32:40.220
And I have located the left...

32:40.950 --> 32:42.580
gastric artery.

32:50.060 --> 32:52.820
There is the perforation.

32:52.860 --> 33:01.870
There are only two stitches in a perforation which needed 8 to 10 for closure.

33:01.970 --> 33:04.860
They never sealed the artery.

33:04.930 --> 33:06.550
Ok. That's enough,buzz.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.800
Thank you.

33:08.090 --> 33:11.170
Can you play the hospital surgery footage now.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.920
Can you magnify his hands?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.650
Just give me one second.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.340
What am I looking at?

33:31.980 --> 33:33.840
A man...

33:34.250 --> 33:38.550
pretending to stitch while a little boy bleeds out.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.520
Thank you,buzz.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.550
Howard?

33:48.570 --> 33:51.180
I'm sorry,this has gone beyond the purview of a hospital.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.130
I believe,at this point,

33:52.170 --> 33:55.330
you and dr. Woods would be better served by a lawyer.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.280
Excuse me,chief johnson.

34:02.930 --> 34:04.400
If you gentlemen have seen enough,

34:04.430 --> 34:08.540
I'll have questions for you after I speak with deputy district attorney garnett here.

34:08.570 --> 34:09.210
Lieutenant tao,

34:09.210 --> 34:13.750
would you please escort doctors woods and sands into interview room 1 and read them their rights.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.300
Thank you so much.

34:15.330 --> 34:17.230
Right this way,doctors.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.540
You have the right to remain silent...

34:23.000 --> 34:23.940
I'm a little lost.

34:23.969 --> 34:26.480
What do you want me to do with these guys?

34:27.719 --> 34:29.199
Uh,well,to start with,

34:29.239 --> 34:35.710
you could indict them for second degree murder or conspiracy to commit grievous bodily injury,negligent homicide.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.510
Are you joking?

34:36.540 --> 34:38.969
Dr. Woods didn't try to help that boy out at all.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.150
He's clearly putting on a show for the camera.

34:41.179 --> 34:44.800
Or he's a surgeon with poor aim after 16 hours on his feet.

34:44.830 --> 34:46.400
Listen,before I can prosecute a crime,

34:46.429 --> 34:48.150
I need to establish a crime has been committed.

34:48.150 --> 34:49.820
What you're describing so far--

34:49.830 --> 34:52.320
the mother's video indicates that he didn't do--

34:52.360 --> 34:54.360
oh,yeah. The freak show amateur autopsy.

34:54.389 --> 34:58.320
Putting aside how the jury's gonna react to watching a mother dissect her own son,

34:58.360 --> 35:00.140
once the body was released by the morgue,

35:00.160 --> 35:01.500
it was outside of the chain of evidence.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.960
That tape is completely inadmissible.

35:04.400 --> 35:09.130
Nick langner was an 8 year old boy who went into the er vomiting and came out dead.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.170
And those men did that to him.

35:11.190 --> 35:13.960
Well,prove that's what they intended,

35:14.120 --> 35:16.310
and we'll talk.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.970
Sorry for the hold uP.

35:22.030 --> 35:24.300
We try not to keep people waiting so long.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.750
I should tell you that I never speak without a lawyer present,

35:26.780 --> 35:31.290
so you'll understand if i respectfully decline to answer your questions.

35:31.460 --> 35:34.740
You've both invoked your right to counsel which makes an interview impossible.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.600
So I'll just have a theoretical discussion with lieutenant tao here.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.710
I don't really have any questions anyway.

35:40.750 --> 35:45.750
Just some good news for one of you,and some very bad news for the other.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.150
Lieutenant tao,which should i give them first?

35:48.180 --> 35:50.320
I'm thinking they'd like to hear the good news.

35:50.340 --> 35:51.400
Ok.

35:51.810 --> 35:53.650
Dr. Sands,last sunday night,

35:53.670 --> 35:59.790
you killed a young boy due to acts of negligence and malpractice and then lied about it.

35:59.820 --> 36:00.370
Gosh...

36:00.370 --> 36:04.200
now that I've said that out loud,the good news doesn't sound so great.

36:04.260 --> 36:05.680
It gets better though.

36:06.510 --> 36:11.030
Nicholas langner was admitted to the er at 18:42.

36:11.070 --> 36:14.930
At 18:48,dr. Sands ordered a cbc,

36:14.970 --> 36:17.340
chem panel,and coags.

36:17.370 --> 36:21.400
Coags were to measure how well nicky's blood would clot.

36:21.850 --> 36:24.150
About how long do these tests take,lieutenant tao?

36:24.170 --> 36:25.390
At least 20 minutes.

36:25.410 --> 36:32.150
And yet,dr. Sands,you began the endoscopy at 18:55,only 7 minutes later.

36:32.170 --> 36:35.150
Before you could've possibly seen the results of nicky's blood test.

36:35.180 --> 36:36.430
Which is a shame.

36:36.450 --> 36:40.390
Because those coags would've shown that nicky's platelets were extremely low,

36:40.420 --> 36:43.330
indicating a condition called...

36:43.630 --> 36:45.210
lieutenant tao?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.590
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
Itp.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.680
Actually,if you had looked him over at the er,

36:51.710 --> 36:56.160
you might have noticed nicky had itp simply by looking at the bruises on his torso.

36:56.190 --> 36:57.850
I know how to diagnose itp.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.260
Oh,I'm sorry,are you speaking?

36:59.290 --> 37:01.780
Have you revoked your right to counsel?

37:01.820 --> 37:02.750
No.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.190
Ok.

37:04.350 --> 37:09.020
My guess is the reason you didn't notice the bruising was because you just finished a 24-hour shift.

37:09.050 --> 37:10.500
If you hadn't had one foot out the door,

37:10.530 --> 37:13.540
you might have given nicholas plasma for clotting,

37:13.570 --> 37:16.470
had a surgeon standing by and everything might have been fine.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.010
Instead,you rushed in to your endoscopy,

37:18.040 --> 37:19.410
and considering how tired you were,

37:19.440 --> 37:21.150
and how much blood was in nicky's stomach,

37:21.180 --> 37:25.070
it's not so surprising that you perforated the kid's gastric artery,is it?

37:25.100 --> 37:26.830
Don't answer that,dr. Sands.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.790
You don't speak without a lawyer.

37:28.810 --> 37:35.500
Well,the good news about all of this is that everything that we've just described is merely malpractice.

37:35.510 --> 37:38.130
Oh,your insurance premiums may go up,

37:38.160 --> 37:40.740
and you may have some bad publicity,but,

37:40.770 --> 37:42.490
malpractice is not a criminal offense.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.290
So you are free to go,dr. Sands.

37:45.330 --> 37:49.290
Unfortunately,dr. Woods,I can't say the same thing about you.

37:50.590 --> 37:55.700
You are aware that melissa langner's videotape directly contradicts what you told us.

37:55.720 --> 38:01.060
You did not repair nicky's gastric artery,though why,I have no idea.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.370
It doesn't really matter.

38:02.390 --> 38:05.550
The surgeon's report clearly states you sutured the artery closed.

38:05.580 --> 38:06.390
You even billed for it,

38:06.420 --> 38:08.760
and that's your signature on the bottom.

38:08.860 --> 38:14.150
It's quite legible actually considering what they say about doctor's handwriting.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.290
Anyway...

38:15.310 --> 38:22.520
I'm sure you are aware that falsifying medical records for fraudulent purposes is a felony.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.760
I think I see what she's trying to do,

38:23.790 --> 38:25.370
but if he speaks without a lawyer,

38:25.400 --> 38:26.840
nothing he says can be used in court.

38:26.860 --> 38:29.120
She's trying to get him--
where's everybody at?

38:29.150 --> 38:31.630
I thought you were going to see ross?

38:31.680 --> 38:33.210
What the--

38:33.370 --> 38:35.960
what is she doing in there?

38:37.410 --> 38:40.260
Oh,my. Dr. Sands,you're still here.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.870
I got so wrapped up in giving dr. Woods his bad news,

38:42.900 --> 38:44.750
that I completely forgot you were here.

38:44.770 --> 38:45.600
Run along now.

38:45.620 --> 38:49.130
Make sure to get your parking validated on the way out.

38:51.670 --> 38:54.220
You're not going anywhere.

38:55.870 --> 38:58.740
Dr. Woods,I have to advise you not to speak without an attorney.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.830
This is ridiculous.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.090
I don't need an attorney.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.500
I'm revoking my right to counsel.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.740
It was his fault.

39:11.060 --> 39:13.420
I never expected that you'd do anything but find the bleeding.

39:13.450 --> 39:15.760
You knew the kid was hypoxic when he hit the table.

39:15.790 --> 39:20.310
I had 3 minutes to find your mistake and that left me 45 seconds to fix it.

39:20.330 --> 39:21.810
Then what?

39:21.890 --> 39:26.260
The boy had no blood pumped to his brain for almost 4 minutes.

39:26.290 --> 39:28.680
So he would've woke up paralyzed.

39:28.710 --> 39:29.980
Maybe blind.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.160
Mentally handicapped for the rest of his life.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.500
At best.

39:33.530 --> 39:34.790
You didn't know that.

39:34.860 --> 39:36.590
Ok,ok.

39:37.310 --> 39:39.980
Let me see if I've got this straight,doctor.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.590
Are you saying you could have repaired the artery,

39:42.610 --> 39:44.020
but knowing it would take another minute,

39:44.050 --> 39:49.320
you chose to let nicholas langner die rather than bring him back in less than pristine condition?

39:49.350 --> 39:53.170
No,no,no. Not Less than pristine condition.

39:53.370 --> 39:56.810
Irreparably damaged.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.240
But it's possible that he might have been fine,

39:59.260 --> 40:02.630
and you wouldn't have known that until you resuscitated him.

40:02.750 --> 40:06.680
I had both my hands in that boy's abdomen with seconds,

40:06.700 --> 40:12.820
seconds to weigh the likely outcome,death,or severe disability.

40:12.870 --> 40:15.790
Not to mention,exposing your carelessness.

40:15.820 --> 40:17.860
I never asked you to cover for me.

40:17.890 --> 40:20.770
Only because you lack the guts.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.530
Given the options,I was presented with,ms. Johnson,

40:24.550 --> 40:27.930
I made absolutely the right choice.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.110
To kill nicholas langner?

40:30.130 --> 40:31.600
To let him die.

40:31.620 --> 40:32.760
Yes.

40:32.930 --> 40:39.690
Yes,I let him die because as it so happens,ms. Johnson,that's my job.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.150
Is it?

40:41.180 --> 40:47.640
I make more life and death decisions before 10 o'clock in the morning than most people make in a lifetime.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.760
On the rare occasion that I can't save someone,

40:50.790 --> 40:54.740
I don't have time to weep and wail and point fingers

40:54.760 --> 41:00.560
because in the next room,there's another patient whose life is on the line.

41:00.580 --> 41:04.080
I made the right choice with nicholas langner.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.540
The only choice that made any sense.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.300
And I'd do it again.

41:13.820 --> 41:16.960
If you were so certain that you made the right choice,

41:16.980 --> 41:20.250
why did you try to blame nicky's mother for her son's death?

41:20.280 --> 41:25.280
You knew that munchausen's by proxy was not in any of that boy's charts.

41:42.010 --> 41:43.910
Did I not tell you to help robbery/homicide?

41:43.950 --> 41:44.760
What are you doing here?

41:44.770 --> 41:46.590
Getting a physician to admit to manslaughter.

41:46.610 --> 41:48.340
You heard him,mr. Garnett.

41:48.370 --> 41:50.520
Todd woods said he chose to let nick langner die.

41:50.540 --> 41:51.820
No,that's not what I heard.

41:51.850 --> 41:53.510
What I heard was a doctor saying,in his opinion,

41:53.550 --> 41:55.700
he could not save that child's life.

41:55.730 --> 41:59.270
And no jury is ever going to convict this man and no judge is ever gonna let it go to trial,

41:59.310 --> 42:00.490
and malpractice is not a crime,

42:00.530 --> 42:02.620
so at the risk of repeating myself,what do you want me to do?

42:02.650 --> 42:07.170
You tell me exactly what you want those doctors to say in order to try them for manslaughter and I will go back in there,

42:07.190 --> 42:09.400
and I will get them to say it.

42:09.490 --> 42:10.590
I'm sorry,chief johnson.

42:10.630 --> 42:13.890
I don't prosecute cases I know I can't win.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.840
Excuse me,fellows.

42:16.150 --> 42:18.610
You're just like dr. Woods.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.970
Unless you're assured a perfect outcome,you walk away.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.110
And you're just like this crazy mother here.

42:24.130 --> 42:26.650
Insisting we treat tragedy as murder.

42:26.730 --> 42:30.220
So how about this,ma'am.You pick your battles,I'll pick mine.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.090
All right. This case is officially over. Now.

42:40.110 --> 42:43.470
How soon can you get your people to laurel canyon?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.980
Lieutenant tao.

42:47.570 --> 42:50.220
Please report to robbery/homicide.

42:50.450 --> 42:53.800
And detective daniels,if you could wait for me.

43:00.430 --> 43:01.840
Before I let these doctors go,

43:01.860 --> 43:04.960
I want to apologize to melissa langner for the world we live in.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.350
Excuse mE.

43:17.140 --> 43:18.630
Ms. Langner.

43:18.740 --> 43:21.490
I am so very sorry to have to tell you...

43:21.500 --> 43:23.850
buzz,turn the volume down,please.

43:23.890 --> 43:25.520
I can't listen to this.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.710
What?

43:47.160 --> 43:48.370
Sorry.

43:48.390 --> 43:49.780
You want to split?

43:49.810 --> 43:51.860
Oh,no,thanks,chief.

43:58.110 --> 43:59.330
look,detective.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.300
I know you're upset,but...

44:05.340 --> 44:07.210
we did everything we could.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.940
We don't--

44:09.350 --> 44:11.190
punish. We don'T...

44:11.220 --> 44:11.990
prosecute.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.650
We just...

44:13.820 --> 44:16.170
we just find out the truth.

44:32.590 --> 44:34.020
It's around the corner.

44:39.130 --> 44:40.660
Drop your weapon!

44:40.820 --> 44:41.980
Right now!

44:42.020 --> 44:43.230
Drop your weapon.

44:43.260 --> 44:45.170
Right there.Drop it.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.710
Turn around!

44:57.400 --> 45:02.290
Should be a much easier case for you to prosecute,ms. Johnson.

45:06.030 --> 45:09.430
You know,I think dr. Woods thought he was god.

45:11.920 --> 45:14.240
Turns out he was wrong.
