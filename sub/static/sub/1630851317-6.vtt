00:02.303 --> 00:04.372
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.472 --> 00:05.539
KEMI:
So this is what we do:

00:05.639 --> 00:07.408
Chukwuemeka and I get
back together,

00:07.508 --> 00:09.277
and you have your happy son.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.444
So happy.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.048
Then, you and I will need
to see the women

00:14.148 --> 00:16.750
to see who is fit
to bear your grandchildren.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.087
Wait, what?
Shh.

00:19.187 --> 00:22.590
Why would you get any say in
who this new woman should be?

00:22.690 --> 00:24.292
The same reason you get a say.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.526
I am his mother.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.095
And I am his Kemi.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.028
Do I get a say?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.034
So, what do you think, Auntie?

00:35.536 --> 00:38.706
I can find no fault
with this arrangement.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.342
Oh, we have not met.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.611
I am Chukwuemeka.
This is Morenike.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.779
A cousin of Abishola staying
with her family.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.448
It is wonderful to meet you.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.016
You as well.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.551
Are you as student?
Yes.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.120
At Wayne State.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.554
I went to Wayne State.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.323
I'm studying to become
a pharmacist.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.491
Uh-uh, you are kidding.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.692
I am a pharmacist.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.328
It must be fate that we met.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.729
(chuckles):
Yes.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.998
What are the odds you'd meet
another failed doctor?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.438
My little Puff Puff,
I need your magic hands.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.640
There's a knot in my neck.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.209
I would worry more about
that hump on your back.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.212
Oh. Hello, Auntie.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.149
I thought I felt the temperature
drop a few degrees.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.184
I tried to tell you
Mummy was here,

01:23.284 --> 01:25.686
but you were singing Tina Turner
so loud.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.356
Because that is the only way
to sing Tina Turner.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.260
I thought you had Bible study.
What happened?

01:32.360 --> 01:34.328
Did you finish the book?

01:34.428 --> 01:37.365
Tonight I will be doing
God's work here.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.367
Then I will let you two
and God get to it.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.170
We have chosen
who will be

01:42.270 --> 01:44.405
the mother of Chukwuemeka's
children.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.009
I thought we decided
we'd make that choice together.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.511
I thought that, too,
but you seem

01:50.611 --> 01:53.581
to find a flaw
in everyone I suggest.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.283
I did not realize you wanted
your son to settle

01:55.383 --> 01:56.750
for someone less than perfect.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.519
He already has.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.588
Oh, it's not his fault, a boy
cannot choose his own mother.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.690
(groans) Stop fighting.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.592
Please sit. Please sit.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.663
Kemi, my love,

02:09.763 --> 02:11.699
I know you want
what is best for me.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.101
Mm-hmm.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.637
So please do not be angry
straightaway.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.207
At least give it
a chance.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.474
This girl is from
a prestigious family.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.475
She is studious,

02:21.575 --> 02:23.677
devoutly religious.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.413
And, most importantly, does not

02:25.513 --> 02:28.182
have any sons
the same age as Chukwuemeka.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.318
Funmbi is six months younger!

02:30.418 --> 02:32.986
Kemi, we have chosen Morenike.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.655
Abishola's cousin.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.626
Oh. I see.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.061
And have you spoken to her
about this?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.564
Not yet, we were going to
bring it up in church.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.367
Well, that's good.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.369
I'm so happy she's going again.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.240
She was angry with God
for such a long time.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.173
What are you talking about?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.143
Oh, she didn't tell you?

02:56.244 --> 02:57.278
I shouldn't say anything.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.146
Why was she angry with God?

03:00.281 --> 03:02.216
Well, you didn't
hear this from me,

03:02.316 --> 03:04.418
but she has been married before.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.388
To the Dark Prince.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.290
The Fallen Angel.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.592
Satan!

03:13.294 --> 03:14.194
Nonsense.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.263
May God strike me down

03:15.363 --> 03:17.197
if I am lying.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.100
There you go.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.036
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

03:46.527 --> 03:48.128
You're still here?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.563
Everybody's gone for the day.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.098
I hate bringing work
home with me.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.000
I'll sleep a lot better
knowing this is done.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.503
You know, when you got demoted
to the warehouse floor,

03:55.603 --> 03:56.704
I didn't think
your ego could take it,

03:56.804 --> 03:58.105
but I was wrong.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.740
Sometimes people
surprise you, Bob.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.309
Hmm.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.443
Anyway, for my next company car,
should I

04:02.543 --> 04:04.412
go Camaro SS
or stick with a Corvette?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.014
This is what
you've been working on?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.582
For two days.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.618
I'm so stressed,
I almost called in sick.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.586
Let me help you.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.455
You're not getting
a new company car.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.023
So we're extending the lease

04:16.123 --> 04:17.625
on the one I've got now?
No.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.493
We're buying it out?
No.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.094
I don't see any other option.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.196
You're not management anymore.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.365
If I get you a company car,

04:24.465 --> 04:25.499
I'm gonna have to get one
for everybody.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.601
That's really generous of you.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.437
It's not happening, bud.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.072
Look, I get it.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.375
As my boss, you can't be seen
giving me special treatment.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.043
Exactly.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.044
But as my big brother...

04:37.144 --> 04:38.746
As your big brother,
no car, idiot.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.382
You struck an employee!

04:43.083 --> 04:45.285
I'm telling Mom!

04:49.857 --> 04:51.492
Abishola.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.126
What is the medical term
for webbed feet?

04:53.226 --> 04:54.194
Syndactyly.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.729
Thank you.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.331
What are you doing?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.033
I'm creating
a fake Wikipedia page

05:00.133 --> 05:01.369
about Morenike's family.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.303
They are a sickly bunch.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.506
I am part of Morenike's family.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.709
Oh, good.
I can put "gigantism" in there.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.545
Why are you doing all this?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.013
I have to convince Ogechi

05:13.113 --> 05:15.282
that Chukwuemeka is marrying
a genetic dud.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.950
I think that is a terrible idea.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.085
What choice do I have?

05:18.185 --> 05:20.087
I am fighting for
the love of my life.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.221
By spreading lies
on the Internet?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.156
What else is the Internet for?

05:24.358 --> 05:26.660
Boy, the things that go on
under that wig.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.563
I am sorry, Gloria,
but I am desperate.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.365
And if either of you
cared about me at all,

05:31.465 --> 05:34.101
you would give me the medical
term for overly large ears.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.335
Macrotia.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.570
Thank you.
(typing)

05:36.670 --> 05:39.072
I will pair that
with "tiny head disease."

05:39.172 --> 05:40.374
Microcephaly.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.209
Stop helping her!
(typing)

05:48.115 --> 05:48.749
Hold still.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.217
It stings.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.685
Do not be such a baby.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.388
Last week, someone on the floor
lost a finger.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.189
I did not hear about that.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.659
And as long as I am safety
manager, no one ever will.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.929
Just got my paycheck.

06:02.029 --> 06:02.963
I don't know
how you guys do it.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.331
Do what?

06:04.432 --> 06:07.568
You know, live on,
you know, this.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.336
You have to be frugal.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.706
I don't know what that is.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.608
It is very simple.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.411
In life, there are things
that you need to survive,

06:17.511 --> 06:19.480
and things that bring you joy.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.482
Remove all joy.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.517
Then what's the point of living?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.719
I do not recommend asking
yourself that question.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.956
You do not need to buy joy,

06:29.056 --> 06:29.723
it is everywhere.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.391
A quiet sunrise,

06:31.492 --> 06:33.160
a warm summer breeze,

06:33.260 --> 06:35.429
a discarded joke book
you find on the sidewalk.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.030
You found that book
on the sidewalk?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.499
I think it found me.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.135
Look, it's easy
for you guys to say,

06:42.235 --> 06:45.138
you were born into... frugacity?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.040
Fru... frugaliciousness?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.141
GOODWIN:
Frugality.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.543
And I grew up with money.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.178
My father was a judge.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.279
Really?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.548
What happened?

06:54.648 --> 06:57.117
I decided to forgo
my father's wealth

06:57.217 --> 06:59.687
and come to this country
to make my own way.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.955
(sighs) Whoops.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.957
I support my family,

07:04.057 --> 07:04.958
I own my own home,

07:05.058 --> 07:07.127
and I enjoy my work.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.128
What else is there?

07:08.228 --> 07:11.264
So much, you have no idea.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.035
You made the same choice I did,
Douglas.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.336
What do you mean?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.472
You left your cushy office job,

07:18.572 --> 07:20.440
to make an honest living
on the warehouse floor.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.677
Well, my mom made me do it.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.178
But you did it.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.681
And now you have
the pride that comes

07:27.781 --> 07:29.316
with making
an honest living.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.151
Standing on your own two feet.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.287
(chuckles):
Yeah. I guess I do.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.189
Huh.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.725
Thanks, guys.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.227
(both chuckle)

07:40.327 --> 07:41.695
That was nice, what you said.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.597
It was nonsense.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.604
More tea, Chukwuemeka?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.640
Yes, please.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.308
Such a lovely girl.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.510
AUNTIE OLU:
Yes.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.311
She also cooks, cleans

07:58.411 --> 08:01.014
and has all of her
original teeth.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.583
Just like her uncle.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.153
I thought you had a bridge.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.255
And you have seven fillings.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.991
There, all our secrets are out.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.228
Oh, e kaale, everyone.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.197
(others respond)
E kaale, Abishola.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.966
Your mail is
on the table there.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.334
Oh, thank you for keeping it.
Mm-hmm.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.605
And opening it.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.675
Congratulations on
your new credit card limit.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.577
Very exciting.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.547
Morenike,
I insist that you come

08:33.647 --> 08:36.116
to Nigeria with Chukwuemeka
and me next month.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.085
But, Auntie, I have school.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.387
You will do it online.

08:40.487 --> 08:41.989
Mummy, please.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.490
There is no need to rush this.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.594
You're already behind on
giving me my grandchildren.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.261
There will have to be
twins to catch up.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.565
Those also run in our family.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.101
Who has a twin?
My uncle.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.502
He ate his twin in the womb.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.672
Must you air
all our dirty laundry?

09:00.073 --> 09:00.708
(chuckles)

09:02.042 --> 09:05.012
Look at us.
Carpool buddies.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.180
(chuckles)
Uh-huh.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.548
So, how was your day?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.483
You were there.
Well...

09:10.584 --> 09:12.085
I was there,

09:12.185 --> 09:13.286
but I wasn't there.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.623
(chuckles)
(groans)

09:15.723 --> 09:17.457
Come on, Mom.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.027
You know, we can't squander
these precious minutes.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.996
We don't know how many Tuesdays
with Dottie we have left.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.232
I've got plenty
of Tuesdays left.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.268
Sure.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.171
(phone rings)

09:31.271 --> 09:33.073
Oh. Hey, Douglas. What's up?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.174
Where are you?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.609
Driving Mom home.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.310
You forget something?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.979
I don't think so.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.148
Me! I don't have a car!

09:41.248 --> 09:42.482
Oh, shoot, that's right.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.516
I'm sorry.

09:43.617 --> 09:44.718
You gonna come back and get me?

09:44.818 --> 09:46.253
Well-- (sighs)

09:46.353 --> 09:47.487
Can't you just take an Uber?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.389
I don't make that kind of
money anymore!

09:49.489 --> 09:50.523
I'm frugal!

09:50.624 --> 09:52.192
You're a smart boy, Douglas.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.460
Figure out a way to get home.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.594
Hang on.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.097
Goodwin,
is the forklift street-legal?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.198
GOODWIN:
No.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.399
DOUGLAS:
I'm out of ideas, Christina!

10:00.567 --> 10:03.003
Just hang up on him.
Really?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.337
You have my permission.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.438
(chuckles)

10:05.538 --> 10:06.439
Christina?

10:06.539 --> 10:07.975
Good luck, Douglas!

10:08.075 --> 10:10.077
(laughing)

10:16.316 --> 10:18.051
Do you need help?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.586
Oh. No, thank you, Auntie.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.189
Ah. You know you do not
have to call me Auntie.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.491
Ah. I must respect my elders,

10:24.591 --> 10:26.459
or my mother will reach
across the ocean

10:26.559 --> 10:28.361
and hit me with her shoe.
(chuckles)

10:28.461 --> 10:29.697
Okay.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.999
Well, as an elder,
may I give you some advice?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.366
Of course.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.335
You are a sweet girl.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.105
You came here to study.
Do not jeopardize that.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.707
What do you mean?

10:39.807 --> 10:42.209
This whole Chukwuemeka situation
is a lot more complicated

10:42.309 --> 10:44.111
than they are telling you.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.512
There's another party involved.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.180
You mean Kemi.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.381
You know about her?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.616
Of course.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.418
And do not worry,
she will not be a problem.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.520
(scoffs)
I don't think you understand.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.555
Kemi is always a problem.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.591
You do not want her as an enemy.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.994
Perhaps she does not want me
as an enemy.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.629
You?

11:02.730 --> 11:06.399
Back home, whenever
a snake got in the house,

11:06.499 --> 11:08.335
I was the one
to take care of it.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.138
Others were too scared.

11:11.238 --> 11:15.075
But I knew, all you have
to do is be patient, eh?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.410
Let the snake
believe it is safe,

11:17.510 --> 11:20.580
and then in one swift motion,

11:20.680 --> 11:21.581
chop off its head.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.516
(kettle whistling)

11:26.787 --> 11:29.522
Would you like some more tea?

11:29.622 --> 11:31.491
Auntie?

11:39.499 --> 11:42.335
Oh, hello, Kemi.
Chukwuemeka.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.738
I just came to pick up
a few things.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.074
Two Clif Bars...

11:48.475 --> 11:50.677
And strawberry-flavored
lubricant?

11:50.778 --> 11:52.445
There was a sale on Clif Bars.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.482
And the strawberry lubricant?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.785
Oh. That is for my next lover.

11:57.885 --> 12:01.321
Or lovers.
I like to keep my options open.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.123
What is going on?

12:03.223 --> 12:06.994
You are starting a new life,
and so am I.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.363
Ooh. I have coupons.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.266
Shouldn't we talk about this?

12:13.366 --> 12:14.467
There's nothing to talk about.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.236
Your mother has
made up her mind.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.105
You will marry Morenike

12:18.205 --> 12:21.008
and have dull children
with giant ears.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.977
But I still want to be with you.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.479
Well, you cannot have my cake
and eat it, too.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.082
I'd like a bag, please.

12:29.182 --> 12:29.682
Paper or plastic?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.551
Plastic!

12:33.753 --> 12:35.188
How about we honeymoon
in Greece?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.357
Oh, I love a gyro.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.627
So you are picking our honeymoon
based on a sandwich?

12:40.727 --> 12:42.229
Not just the sandwich.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.232
The history, the
architecture, the beaches.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.100
I thought you hated beaches.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.701
Well, I did about
50 pounds ago.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.570
But now I want to
strut my stuff.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.572
You know they have nude beaches.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.208
Eating a gyro in
my birthday suit.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.510
(phone chimes)
Now that's a honeymoon.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.013
(groans)
Everything okay?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.248
Kemi is upset.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.250
And the sky is blue.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.584
What'd she do this time?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.553
This one is not entirely
her fault.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.355
Wait, no, actually it is.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.622
(chuckles)
(chimes)

13:09.722 --> 13:12.225
Here's an idea,
maybe sit this one out.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.560
Oh, what are you talking about?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.229
I'm just saying Kemi's got
a lot of problems.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.664
Catch her on the next one.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.967
I can't. She is my friend.
I have to help her.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.202
Do you?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.504
You know, when I was a kid,
every year my friends would

13:24.604 --> 13:26.139
drag me to this
haunted corn maze.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.240
It was horrifying.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.109
Hands coming
through the stalks,

13:29.209 --> 13:30.643
clowns with chainsaws.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.045
Were there real ghosts?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.446
No.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.715
So why were you scared?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.417
I was ten, but that's
not the point.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.386
(groans)
Ten is old enough to know.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.488
Can I finish my
story, please?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.123
Continue.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.624
After a few years,

13:44.724 --> 13:47.094
I realized I didn't have
to go through the maze.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.129
I could just duck out,
grab a taffy apple,

13:49.229 --> 13:50.630
and meet my buddies
by the exit.

13:50.730 --> 13:54.701
So, Kemi's love life is
a haunted corn maze?

13:54.801 --> 13:57.470
And she's the clown
with the chainsaw.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.311
I am not a manipulative person,

14:04.411 --> 14:06.013
but it's hard to do nothing

14:06.113 --> 14:07.680
when you see people
making bad decisions

14:07.780 --> 14:08.748
and ruining their lives.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.653
Your Chewbacca dude doesn't know
what he's losing.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.956
Chukwuemeka.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.125
Yeah, I'm never gonna get that.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.460
You know, I'm going through
something very similar

14:20.560 --> 14:21.528
right now with my Corvette.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.430
How is that similar?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.698
I was forced to give up
something that I love.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.501
It wasn't sexual
like your relationship,

14:28.601 --> 14:31.504
but I did have sex in it.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.574
Not easy.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.176
It was very tight.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.478
Even when you were alone.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.282
I suppose Chukwuemeka is
a bit like a Corvette.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.586
Sexy, powerful,
a fun ride.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.522
But at the same time,
it's a gas guzzler.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.991
Mm.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.725
If Chukwuemeka eats
even a little cheese,

14:52.825 --> 14:55.528
his body backfires
like an old tractor.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.232
The Vette didn't even have
a rear camera.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.135
Was constantly bumping into
trash cans and short people.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.072
Hmm. And nobody would
call Chukwuemeka

15:05.172 --> 15:07.975
the sharpest razor in
the CVS men's grooming aisle.

15:08.075 --> 15:08.976
(chuckles)

15:09.076 --> 15:10.710
There you go.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.445
Chewbacca, Corvettes.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.481
We're better off without 'em.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.617
Maybe so. Hmm.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.153
(rings)
(groans)

15:20.253 --> 15:21.688
It's my stop.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.090
Nice talking to you.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.492
And you.
What is your stop?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.295
I don't have one.
I gave the driver my address.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.563
Okay.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.434
I got to tell you,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.069
I think I've become
a better Christian

15:36.169 --> 15:37.437
since coming to this church.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.638
That's wonderful.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.740
Why do you think that is?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.475
The singing? The praying?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.477
Honestly,
I think it's the food.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.746
I could get baptized
in that soup.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.116
Hello, Bob.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.550
Hello, Abishola.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.551
Hello, Auntie.
Auntie.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.586
Where is that old woman

15:53.686 --> 15:55.488
that you fraternize with?

15:55.588 --> 15:57.757
Old woman?
Easy. Easy.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.993
I have not seen Kemi today.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.362
And praise God for that.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.331
Good morning, Auntie.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.199
Morenike.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.401
Have you killed any snakes
lately?

16:08.501 --> 16:11.371
There was one,
but I scared it away.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.273
There's snakes in this church?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.442
Hello, everybody.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.045
God is good. Hmm?

16:18.145 --> 16:21.214
Hello, Kemi.
Who is your friend?

16:21.314 --> 16:24.017
Sure, let's
call him my "friend."

16:24.117 --> 16:25.485
This is Terrence.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.254
We work together
at the hospital.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.323
Hello.
How you doing?

16:30.423 --> 16:32.425
I like your aftershave.
Smells like strawberries.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.637
See?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.306
Not so bad.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.241
And nobody's stabbing anybody.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.709
Okay. We didn't think that,
Douglas.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.511
Well, I did. That's why...

16:51.611 --> 16:54.147
I'm not carrying
any cash!

16:57.084 --> 16:58.551
Really? So I got to
pay your fares?

16:58.651 --> 17:01.321
How much is it, a dime?

17:01.421 --> 17:03.156
(groans):
Oh, my God!

17:07.327 --> 17:08.628
Sorry. It should work.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.097
I put money on it yesterday.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.064
Don't worry about it.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.932
I have cash.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.601
Relax. It's on me.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.204
I saw you help out that rich
old lady and her daughter.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.607
You do what you can.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.342
You can always
tell the people

17:22.442 --> 17:24.311
who've never
ridden a bus before.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.347
They act like they're going
on a poor person safari.
(scoffs)

17:27.447 --> 17:30.383
Their entitlement's disgusting.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.984
Olivia.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.421
Douglas.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.955
Actually, Doug.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.324
Down-to-earth Doug.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.326
That's what my buddies...

17:39.426 --> 17:41.261
in the warehouse call me.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.029
(chuckles)
Where I work.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.199
You know, with my hands.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.000
(whispers):
Everything is so sticky.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.202
Do you have a wet wipe?

17:49.302 --> 17:52.572
No, because
I don't have a purse!

17:54.474 --> 17:57.110
(sighs)
Those weirdos are
making me uncomfortable.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.546
You mind giving me your number
in case they try to follow me

17:59.646 --> 18:00.680
when I get off the bus?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.282
I'm not gonna do that.

18:02.382 --> 18:05.051
(chuckles)
Was worth a try.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.287
Guess you'll just have to
ride again tomorrow

18:07.387 --> 18:09.122
so I know you're okay.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.225
I guess I will.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.694
'Cause I don't have a car.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.430
And I take the bus.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.998
To my job.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.236
At a warehouse.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.208
Bus driver seems cute.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.108
Don't talk to me,
don't talk to me,

18:29.209 --> 18:30.343
don't talk to me.
