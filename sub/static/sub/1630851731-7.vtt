WEBVTT

00:04.271 --> 00:07.305
- You always take the ladies
to such swanky places?

00:07.375 --> 00:10.709
- Bella, with
a woman like you,

00:10.778 --> 00:13.512
It is impossible to make it home
before indulging.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.048
- Oh, you're good.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.924
(grunting)
- wait! Frankie.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.926
There is a woman in trouble.
- Wha...?

00:27.928 --> 00:30.596
- No!
- I just can't do this anymore!

00:31.665 --> 00:33.932
- Stay here.
- Not a chance.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.401
- Hey! Get your hands
off of her! Hey!

00:36.404 --> 00:38.570
(gasping)

00:43.010 --> 00:45.077
I guess she no need
my help after all.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.778
- Yeah. She knocked him out.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.053
Alessandro, he's dead.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.292
(jazzy theme music)

01:01.328 --> 01:03.928
(woman scatting)

01:23.951 --> 01:26.518
She had short
blond hair, um...

01:26.554 --> 01:29.454
A darker complexion and
there was a-a flower...

01:29.457 --> 01:32.123
- Now, hang on.
Your friend here

01:32.159 --> 01:35.394
Seems to think the woman's hair
was brown like a church mouse

01:35.529 --> 01:37.462
And down to her shoulders.
Which is it?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.464
- Well, with respect, signore,

01:39.533 --> 01:41.333
Frankie is a private
investigator.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.202
- Uh-huh.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.271
Why don't you tell me how tall
this woman was, huh?

01:46.340 --> 01:50.508
- Ah, sh-she was tall.
Tall and, uh, thin, no?

01:50.544 --> 01:53.145
- Um, she was six feet, maybe?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.881
Not necessarily thin. I would
call her a substantial woman.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.217
- Substantial.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.420
You two need
to make up your minds.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.921
- From hunter, sir.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.628
- You can both go.
- If you're gonna find

02:09.697 --> 02:11.496
This woman, you need
a proper description.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.833
- Drake, you're not
the investigator here.
You're the witness.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.102
And not a very good one at that.
Go home.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.981
- Frankie? What are you two
doing here?

02:29.116 --> 02:30.782
- We could say the same.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.517
- Well, they're having the
morality squad crack down

02:32.586 --> 02:34.719
On these dime-a-dance
dancehalls.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.055
Watching women get pawed
while I measure their skirts

02:37.057 --> 02:39.658
Is frustrating work.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.260
- That sounds almost as fun as
the evening that we just had.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.029
Well, up until the point
where we found a dead man.

02:45.065 --> 02:48.867
May he rest in peace.
- What? A dead man?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.736
- Fight gone wrong.
A woman fled the scene

02:51.772 --> 02:53.905
And lyle doesn't seem
to be interested

02:53.908 --> 02:56.408
In helping us find her.
- I'll see what I can suss out?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.610
- That would be great, mary.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.878
Why don't you go
keep the bed warm?

03:00.915 --> 03:02.915
- What? Where are you going?
- I'm gonna see

03:03.050 --> 03:05.416
What I can find out
about this woman.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.255
- Bella, please-- be safe.
- Where's the fun in that?

03:16.063 --> 03:20.299
Excuse me, I'm with the<i> toronto</i>
<i>star.</i> Is the investigation over?

03:20.301 --> 03:23.168
- Yeah, nothing left
to see here.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.268
♪♪

03:58.239 --> 04:00.472
(jew's harp sound)

04:00.474 --> 04:02.974
(laughing)

04:02.977 --> 04:06.945
- Sequins in the morning? This
has italian race car driver

04:07.080 --> 04:10.816
Written all over it.
- Ran into some trouble
of the cadaver sort

04:10.818 --> 04:13.552
Last night. I'm wondering
if you could take a look
at the autopsy report?

04:13.554 --> 04:16.387
- You'll have to be
a little more specific.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.757
- Um, he would've come in here
just after three am.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.961
He was found in an alleyway
just off of--

04:22.963 --> 04:26.030
- King street? Large build,
head wound.
- That's him.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.166
- Your guy's a john doe.

04:28.168 --> 04:31.169
Says here he died of a heart
attack. Case closed.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.640
- A woman cleaned his clock
seconds before he died.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.175
Are you sure that's not
what killed him?
- I can take another look.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.778
- That'd be great. What about
his personal effects?

04:39.847 --> 04:42.514
- Oh! Got them right here.
Mm-hmm.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.949
Here you go.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.759
Sweet creamy custard!

04:57.031 --> 04:59.063
Five hundred bucks.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.733
That's a lot of dough
to carry around loose.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.869
- Bet he carried it in this.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.638
I found it in the alley just
after the cops cleared out.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.141
- I am guessing our john doe's
initials are km.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.477
- No need to guess.
It's monogrammed.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.646
Kelvin macdonald.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.486
- Wake up!
- Oh! What?

05:21.621 --> 05:23.921
(laughing)
what? Why?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.191
- Shep gave me a new life
insurance claim to investigate.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.760
I could really use your help.
- Could we order a coffee first?

05:28.895 --> 05:31.496
- Of course.
- Um, excuse me?

05:31.565 --> 05:34.232
Could we order a couple
of coffees? Thank you.

05:34.234 --> 05:37.436
- Ok, so penelope weinman died
in an explosion two weeks ago

05:37.571 --> 05:40.372
And no body was recovered.
Her husband is trying to collect

05:40.441 --> 05:43.909
On the funeral costs, but I want
to make sure everything's on the
up and up before shep pays out.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.444
- And you want me to check
the police file?
- Please.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.281
I'm sure it's an open-and-shut
case, but I wanna cover
all my bases.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.650
- Got it.
- Hi.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.187
- How do you look so fresh and
rested on less sleep than me?

05:56.256 --> 05:59.123
- Practice.
- Did you find anything out

05:59.159 --> 06:01.460
About the kelvin macdonald case?
- Thank you.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.996
Well-rested and you know
his name. Well, um,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.265
All I can tell you
about mr. Macdonald

06:07.334 --> 06:10.535
Is that he runs a small family
business that makes, um...

06:10.604 --> 06:13.939
Bicycle inner tubes
and accessories.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.741
Uh, his secretary reported him
missing when he didn't show
for a meeting.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.010
- What about the woman
who fled the scene?

06:19.079 --> 06:21.479
- Well, I don't think
they even looked for her.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.082
According to lyle, the coroner--
- ruled it as natural causes.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.819
- Yeah.
- Something isn't right.
I can feel it.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.721
I'll catch up with you two
later.
- Ok.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.361
You sure you're going to get
through the day to get me
that file, rip van winkle?

06:36.496 --> 06:38.530
- Yes.
(laughing)

06:38.665 --> 06:40.232
- Oh!

06:40.367 --> 06:43.000
(phones ringing,
typewriters clicking)

06:51.178 --> 06:53.845
- The macdonalds aren't seeing
visitors. There's been a death

06:53.980 --> 06:56.247
In the family.
- I-I know. I was there.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.717
I came to offer my condolences.
- You were there?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.120
When my brother died?

07:02.189 --> 07:04.856
- Mr. Macdonald, I am so sorry

07:04.858 --> 07:06.724
For your loss.
- Douglas. Please.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.394
- Frankie drake. I'm a private
detective. I--I just have

07:09.529 --> 07:11.829
A couple of questions for you.
- What is it?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.931
- Your brother was
with a woman last night.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.134
Do you have any idea
who she could be?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.337
- I'm afraid kelvin and I
didn't share details

07:19.339 --> 07:21.273
Of our private lives.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.342
Why are you looking
for this woman? I thought
the case was closed?

07:24.344 --> 07:27.812
- I just can't stand loose ends.
- Douglas!

07:27.815 --> 07:30.748
I need you in here now.
- I'm sorry, my father needs me.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.285
Beatrice?
- Of course.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.153
I'll, uh, show you out.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.489
- How long have you worked
for the macdonalds?

07:37.491 --> 07:40.091
- I was kelvin's secretary
for nine years.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.961
- I don't want to get
anyone into trouble,

07:42.963 --> 07:46.030
But do you have any idea who he
could have been with last night?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.967
- He was a very private man.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.437
- But?

07:52.506 --> 07:55.106
- But he did often have me
connect him to a florist

07:55.108 --> 07:58.109
Down on king st. Lister's,
if you can believe it.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.378
I'll write it down for you.
- Why wouldn't I believe it?

08:02.249 --> 08:04.850
- Oh. I, uh...

08:04.985 --> 08:08.019
I just meant because
lister's is right next to...

08:11.825 --> 08:14.392
- The alley where kelvin died.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.265
- I just have a few more
questions about the days

08:20.267 --> 08:22.199
Leading up to your wife's death,
mr. Weinman.

08:22.236 --> 08:25.604
- Listen, is there a problem
with my claim, or something?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.805
- It's just standard procedure.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.375
I know this is a sensitive
topic, but...

08:30.377 --> 08:32.611
Had you and your wife been
having any problems?

08:32.613 --> 08:35.880
- What? Not at all. She was...

08:35.883 --> 08:39.284
We were just
normal nathan and penny.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.589
Wait, are you suggesting I had
something to do with her death?

08:44.591 --> 08:46.625
- Uh, no, no, no. I'm not
suggesting anything.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.727
These are just questions
I have to ask.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.030
- Sorry, it's... It's been
a hard few weeks.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.100
- I understand.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.303
You know what? I think we have
what we need for today.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.172
Oh, one more thing.
- Sure. What is it?

09:01.174 --> 09:04.375
- A photo of penelope? I'd like
to keep one for the file.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.978
- I do have one.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.116
- Great.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.986
You know what? After
I'm done making a copy,

09:15.055 --> 09:18.523
I will drop it off
to you tonight.
- No! Ah...

09:18.525 --> 09:20.925
I mean, yeah, sure. Just...

09:20.928 --> 09:24.662
Call before you come, ok?
The place is a bit of a mess.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.931
- Sure. Will do.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.909
- Excuse me, are you the owner?

09:38.946 --> 09:40.946
- Max lister.
What could I do for ya?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.748
- Well, I am looking
for a woman.
- Aren't we all?

09:43.817 --> 09:45.750
- The woman I'm looking for

09:45.786 --> 09:47.819
Was sent flowers
from this shop regularly.

09:47.888 --> 09:51.222
- Here I, uh... Thought
you might be looking for me.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.959
Always a bridesmaid.
Ah, what's the name?

09:55.028 --> 09:58.429
- That I don't know,
but it was a kelvin macdonald

09:58.465 --> 10:01.366
Who was sending her the flowers.
Does that name ring a bell?

10:01.368 --> 10:04.569
- What'd you say your name was?
- Drake. Yeah.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.172
Frankie drake.
- Right, well,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.742
All I can tell you
is that mr. Macdonald

10:10.877 --> 10:13.645
Ordered a bouquet of amaryllis
every Friday like clockwork.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.982
- Any idea who he sent them to?
- Picked them up. I didn't ask.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.784
Sometimes, it's best
not to ask people

10:19.786 --> 10:21.786
What they like to get up to.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.555
- Right.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.559
Well, we haven't
found the woman yet,

10:27.561 --> 10:30.161
But kelvin macdonald
sent amaryllis to--

10:30.163 --> 10:31.663
Oh! Excuse me.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.098
- It's no problem.
- Frankie, this is, uh...

10:37.604 --> 10:41.005
- The woman from the alley.
- I'm sorry-- what now?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.080
- When I saw you in that alley,

10:49.215 --> 10:51.015
I was so afraid of getting
caught in...

10:51.084 --> 10:54.819
Well, the way I was dressed,
that I panicked.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.955
Once I got home,
I started to worry.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.557
- He thought his slap killed
kelvin. But it didn't.

10:59.593 --> 11:02.360
And he didn't die of a heart
attack, either. He was poisoned.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.096
- Poisoned by what?
- My best guess is aconite.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.165
Probably slipped
into his drink

11:07.167 --> 11:09.300
Sometime, like,
six hours before he died.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.302
- But we were
at the club all night.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.904
- Which club?
- Oh, it's a little...

11:13.940 --> 11:15.840
Underground spot.
- Wait!

11:15.842 --> 11:18.509
How is there an underground club
that we don't know about?

11:18.578 --> 11:20.779
- Well, uh, this place is for...

11:20.781 --> 11:23.982
- Roger, you can trust us.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.450
(sighing)

11:27.521 --> 11:29.320
- Folks call it the flower shop.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.257
- Let me guess:
It's run by max lister?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.192
- Yes.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.595
And it caters to homosexuals.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.400
Kel and I were lovers. But...

11:43.437 --> 11:45.103
- But what?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.738
- Kel was breaking it off
when he--

11:49.743 --> 11:51.543
It was all so fast.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.212
One minute we're arguing
and the next he's on the ground.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.281
I just, I-I-I...
- You thought that
it was your fault?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.486
- It is so hard

12:01.488 --> 12:03.488
For someone like me

12:03.557 --> 12:05.790
To find someone like him.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.094
And now he's gone and the case
is closed, so-- what?

12:10.097 --> 12:13.765
His killer just goes free?
- No. Not if I can help it.

12:13.767 --> 12:17.035
- What do you mean?
- She's a private detective.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.072
- And you'll help?
- I've been working this case

12:21.207 --> 12:22.841
All morning,
looking for you.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.942
(gasping with emotion)

12:26.079 --> 12:29.580
Ok, kelvin died at 1 a.M.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.783
He was poisoned
sometime after 7,

12:31.852 --> 12:33.818
So what time did the two of you
go to the club?

12:33.953 --> 12:35.653
- Oh, we never arrive together.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.988
I'm a performer,
so I have to get in early.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.525
Kel was there
when I went on at 9.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.394
- So where was he
between 7 and 9?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.730
- Well, I'll head to his office
and see what he was up to

12:45.865 --> 12:47.532
Yesterday. Are you
performing tonight?

12:47.667 --> 12:50.134
- If there's a killer in the
club, I'm not sure I want to.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.804
- But when I catch that killer,
it should be business as usual.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.674
- Will you come with me?
- Max will make me right away.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.779
- What about you?
- Who, me?

13:00.914 --> 13:04.549
- Yes, florence. We'd need
to shine you up a bit, but...

13:04.551 --> 13:06.551
It could work.
- Rog,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.553
I'm about as shiny as they come.

13:08.688 --> 13:12.290
(chuckling)
- oh, you'll fit in just fine.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.426
- Oh my gosh! Trudy,

13:15.428 --> 13:17.162
I never expected
a life insurance case

13:17.297 --> 13:19.697
To be this exciting!
Penelope weinman?

13:19.766 --> 13:22.766
She is no stranger to morality
offences, but not only that--

13:22.803 --> 13:26.170
She and her husband run
with the girard mob family!

13:26.206 --> 13:28.239
- That must be why
he was so agitated

13:28.275 --> 13:30.108
When I suggested
visiting his apartment.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.243
- What's this?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.979
And they were in tighter
than even the police knew.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.249
- Wait, what do you mean?
- That's eloise girard.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.452
- Art girard's daughter?
- Mm-hmm. She also has a number

13:41.588 --> 13:43.988
Of morality offenses, not that
she's paid any of the fines.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.190
No one has seen her
in months.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.993
- What about the file
on the explosion?
- Well, the police think

13:49.128 --> 13:51.663
That the explosion was set
by someone in the girard
organization.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.466
- Wait, that's huge. If penelope
died because she was involved

13:55.535 --> 13:59.003
In some criminal activity,
that would make nathan's
claim invalid.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.139
- Yes. But there is one problem.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.341
The police didn't find
any concrete evidence

14:03.343 --> 14:05.276
To support that theory.
- Huh.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.213
- Where are you going?
- To find evidence
that explosion

14:09.216 --> 14:12.483
Was not an accident.
- Well, I'm coming with you!

14:12.552 --> 14:15.586

- He's good.

14:31.438 --> 14:35.105
- That's henrietta.
And she is very much a woman.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.809
- ♪ the kisses that I loved so ♪
- and who do we have here?

14:39.813 --> 14:42.246
- Florence is a friend of kel's.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.648
- Sorry, roger.
There's no new people tonight.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.583
- I heard kelvin was
a bountiful tipper.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.120
You can expect
much the same from me.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.390
- Fine, but this place
is a secret

14:52.459 --> 14:54.726
And it needs to stay that way.
- Of course.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.061
- Thanks, max.
- Uh-huh.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.666
- (man): Love you!

15:04.470 --> 15:06.704
- Hey, alistair.
- Hey, elsa.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.340
What'll it be?
- Nothing for me. It's early.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.408
- I will have a--

15:11.444 --> 15:14.345
Never mind. I wasn't
thirsty, anyway.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.880
(laughing)
what did I do?

15:16.917 --> 15:19.951
And why'd he call you elsa?
- That's my stage name.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.420
Mm-hmm.
- Ooh.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.222
- As for the chill,
florence? Hm.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.159
I think you're going to have
to prove yourself before
anyone will trust you.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.294
- How the heck
can I do that?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.030
- Hm. Everyone
loves a song.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.034
- I haven't sung since I was
kicked out of choir

15:37.170 --> 15:38.970
In catholic school.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.039
- Well,

15:41.174 --> 15:43.774
I'd start warming up
them pipes if I was you.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.843
(clicks tongue)

15:47.847 --> 15:51.182
- I may not know much about
business, but beatrice explained

15:51.184 --> 15:53.651
What the numbers in the monthly
report mean.
- Beatrice

15:53.653 --> 15:56.253
Is a secretary. She doesn't know
what the numbers mean.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.123
- She knows enough to understand
the company's in financial
straits!

15:59.125 --> 16:01.259
- Do you need
something, miss drake?
- That woman should keep

16:01.394 --> 16:04.195
Her nose out of things.
- I've half a mind to--
- could I take a look at that?

16:04.264 --> 16:06.864
- Beatrice! In here now!

16:06.866 --> 16:08.933
- Here.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.802
- Who the hell are you?

16:11.871 --> 16:14.138
- This is the private
investigator I mentioned,
father.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.074
- Mr. Macdonald, I have
some information you need
to hear about your son.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.678
Kelvin was poisoned.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.747
- My goodness.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.082
- Poisoned?
- Do you have any idea

16:25.151 --> 16:27.485
Where he was between seven
and nine last night?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.154
- That's none of your business.
- Mr. Mcdonald. Please.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.892
I see that you have his
calendar. If I could just
take a quick look?

16:34.961 --> 16:38.963
- Absolutely not. The police
have told us the case is closed.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.231
And I'll take
their word over yours.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.900
- Father--
- that's enough!

16:43.836 --> 16:46.370
Go. Now!

16:46.373 --> 16:48.306
- I'll see myself out.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.643
(cheers and applause)

16:54.481 --> 16:56.581
- Whiskey. Straight.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.715
- That's a great set.
- Thanks.

16:58.752 --> 17:02.053
- I wanna get up there, but I
can't seem to find the nerve.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.522
How do you do it?

17:04.524 --> 17:06.990
- Life's too short to not do
the things you want to.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.627
Liquid courage doesn't hurt,
either.
- Mm.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.702
Wish me luck.
- Mm-hmm.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.339
(piano music)

- What're you girls doin' here?
(gasping)

19:21.694 --> 19:24.628
- We were investigating
the explosion.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.532
- Seems like, uh, you're
the type to have your finger

19:28.535 --> 19:30.668
On the pulse of
the neighbourhood.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.971
Did you happen to see anything?
- You a cop?

19:34.007 --> 19:37.208
- No. No, I'm not.
I'm just a morality officer.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.809
And off duty.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.280
- Can't be too careful
in this part of town.

19:42.282 --> 19:46.350
Snitching can land you at
the bottom of lake ontario.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.354
- Indeed, cement boots
and all of that.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.824
- Just before the explosion,
this man came out of here,

19:53.860 --> 19:56.427
Which seemed strange
because it's been abandoned

19:56.562 --> 19:58.496
For a long time.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.232
Just as I got
thinking about it...

20:01.234 --> 20:03.433
(mimics explosion)

20:03.469 --> 20:05.168
- That's an awful coincidence.
- Yeah.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.439
- Uh, is this the man
that you saw?

20:08.574 --> 20:10.374
- Could be.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.010
I was a ways away.

20:13.079 --> 20:16.714
You didn't hear
any of it from me.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.516
- Our lips are sealed.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.352
- Kelvin would've got
a real kick out of that.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.922
- Aw, I think we all did.
That is on me.

20:25.959 --> 20:29.126
- Oh! I feel invincible.

20:29.128 --> 20:32.129
Maybe now I can tell roger
why I really came here tonight.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.732
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

20:34.801 --> 20:37.134
- I don't think kelvin
had a heart attack.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.138
I think someone killed him.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.540
- What are you? Some kind of
amateur detective, or something?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.377
- No, not at all.
Just trying to figure out

20:46.512 --> 20:48.346
What happened to my friend.
Forget I said anything.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.015
- Well, I hate to say it,

20:51.150 --> 20:54.418
But your friend kelvin wasn't
very well liked around here.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.054
- You talking about
someone in particular?

21:01.127 --> 21:04.328
Between you and me?

21:04.464 --> 21:06.963
- You might want
to start with him.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.909
- Wake up!
- What? S-s-sorry.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.779
Anything?
- Mm.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.849
- Oh, that's eloise girard!

21:24.984 --> 21:28.319
- And that's nathan weinman.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.594
Well, there's our motive.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.797
- Well, assuming they were
together before penelope died.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.533
- Looks like we need

- Uh, no, dear.
We were not friends.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.650
That man was so... Flamboyant.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.353
Far too obvious about his money.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.388
I suppose you wouldn't have
heard about the trouble

22:38.424 --> 22:40.724
Some of us have been having
with blackmail?

22:40.727 --> 22:43.194
- Blackmail? Here?

22:43.329 --> 22:45.729
- Only some of the more
well-to-do regulars.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.798
I presumed that kelvin

22:47.800 --> 22:50.066
Might have possibly--
- everyone stay where you are.
This is a raid!

22:50.103 --> 22:52.569
- Police! Don't move!
(shouting)

22:53.973 --> 22:56.640
- Oh, please!
- Hey, stop resisting!

22:56.776 --> 22:59.543
- Let's get this off so we can
see who you really are!

22:59.545 --> 23:02.279
- Let me go!
- Leave him alone!

23:02.348 --> 23:05.149
- What're you gonna do about it?

23:05.151 --> 23:07.218

That's right, girlies! Enjoy it!

23:19.698 --> 23:23.099
- Flo, what the hell happened?
- Frankie, I punched a cop.

23:32.378 --> 23:35.312
But to have been arrested
dressed like this? Oh!

23:35.381 --> 23:37.714
In an illegal club for...

23:37.750 --> 23:40.651
For people like me.
I'm not getting out of here

23:40.653 --> 23:43.454
For a very long time.
- But we were acting
in self-defence.

23:43.456 --> 23:46.123
Detective lyle
was assaulting you!

23:46.192 --> 23:49.392
- You spent one night
in the flower shop, flo.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.463
You have no idea what
it's really like for us.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.465
- I'm sorry.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.902
But we have friends in the
station. We are both
getting outta here.

24:00.306 --> 24:01.739
But in the meanwhile...

24:01.874 --> 24:03.974
What do you know about
blackmail in the club?

24:04.043 --> 24:06.010
- Nothing. Why?

24:06.012 --> 24:08.545
- Lloyd easton mentioned it.
- Oh, god!

24:08.581 --> 24:10.881
- He said kelvin's death
might be related to it.

24:10.917 --> 24:14.485
Roger, we found a lot of money
in his suit pocket.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.820
- What are you suggesting?

24:16.889 --> 24:19.890
- Could kelvin have been
blackmailing people in the club?

24:20.025 --> 24:21.925
- No!

24:21.961 --> 24:24.828
He would never have done
anything to put the club
at risk.

24:24.897 --> 24:28.265
- Ok. Ok. So he's the victim
and the money is the payoff.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.000
How does he end up dead?

24:33.372 --> 24:36.574
- That's why he broke up
with me.
- What?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.575
- He said he couldn't
do it anymore.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.445
- Yeah. Meaning
the relationship.
- Well, that's what I thought.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.448
But maybe he was going
to leave us all.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.852
- To try and get out from under
the thumb of the blackmailer.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.988
- And he got killed for it.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.391
(sighing)

24:56.562 --> 24:59.930
- Flo chakowitz. Roger leblanc.
You're free to go.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.266
- What did I tell you?
Friends in the station.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.067
Let's get outta here.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.271
- Did you really punch
detective lyle?

25:07.273 --> 25:09.273
- Trust me-- he had it coming.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.809
- You at least get something
useful for going to all
that trouble?

25:11.811 --> 25:14.744
- Oh, did I ever. Apparently,
someone is blackmailing

25:14.780 --> 25:16.813
The wealthy clientele
at the club.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.783
I think kelvin stopped paying
and he got killed for it.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.718
- So, who's your blackmailer?

25:21.754 --> 25:23.787
- Maybe whoever found out
about this?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.158
Looks like kelvin
was cheating on roger.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.294
- With henrietta collins?

25:30.429 --> 25:32.796
- I thought kelvin
preferred men.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.832
- He does and she's not.
Henrietta's a male impersonator.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.101
- For some people it's about
the person, not the parts.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.639
- I guess so. But why blackmail
kelvin about an affair

25:41.774 --> 25:43.907
When his entire personal life
was a secret?

25:43.976 --> 25:46.109
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a good question.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.645
Who told you about
the blackmail?

25:48.714 --> 25:50.847
- Stuffy fella named lloyd.
He's the manager

25:50.917 --> 25:54.118
Of the hippodrome orchestra.
- Ok. I'll see if I can
talk to him today.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.087
Do you want to see if max has
any insight into this?
- Will do.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.755
- Thank you, flo.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.859
How's the case for shep going?

26:01.994 --> 26:04.295
- Not as straightforward
as I'd like.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.463
- For starters, today,

26:06.532 --> 26:09.533
We're going to shake down
art girard's daughter!

26:09.535 --> 26:12.969
- Mob boss art girard?
- Mm-hmm. The very same!

26:14.440 --> 26:17.741
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck!

26:17.810 --> 26:21.545
- We need to find out
how long nathan and eloise
have been together.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.548
- Trudy, I think I should be
the one to talk to eloise.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.083
- You're not exactly
inconspicuous, mary.

26:27.119 --> 26:30.487
- Well, exactly! I can use her
morality offences as a pretense.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.023
- Ok, well, how are you going to
get her to talk about nathan?

26:33.092 --> 26:35.558
- Well... I'll figure
something out.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.028
- Improvisation isn't exactly
your strong suit--

26:38.163 --> 26:40.898
- There she is!
- Wait! No, mary! I really think
I should be the one that--

26:41.033 --> 26:43.199
Never mind.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.869
- Excuse me, ma'am?

26:47.973 --> 26:51.508
Ma'am! Uh, excuse me?

27:03.522 --> 27:06.657
- Hey! What're you
doing back here?

27:06.792 --> 27:09.727
- Oh! I just came by to pick up
my bag. It got lost

27:09.729 --> 27:12.329
In all the craziness when the
cops showed up last night.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.398
- Speaking of cops,
that was, uh...

27:15.434 --> 27:17.801
That's some punch you gave
that detective.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.070
You do not know how many times
I've wanted to do the same.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.872
- You mean you've been
raided before?

27:21.874 --> 27:24.008
- Yeah, of course we have.
The cops?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.744
They're, uh, not exactly
fans of my clientele.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.979
And, no offense,
but kelvin dropping dead

27:30.016 --> 27:31.949
Right outside my door
didn't help either.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.550
Natural causes or not.

27:33.586 --> 27:36.419
- Do you think it was?
Natural causes.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.288
- What else would it be?

27:38.290 --> 27:40.223
- I heard there's a blackmailer
preying on your customers.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.360
- Well, it's the first
I'm hearing of it and, uh,

27:44.397 --> 27:46.496
What does that have
to do with kelvin?

27:46.532 --> 27:49.766
- If kelvin was targeted, maybe
one thing led to another.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.136
The blackmailer killed him.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.237
- Well, if we're talking
blackmail, you know
what they say.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.575
The bartender knows
everybody's secrets.

28:00.579 --> 28:03.246
- Uh, ma'am.
- Mm.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.449
- Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

28:06.919 --> 28:09.653
- Excuse me, sir! Do you have a
moment to discuss the good news

28:09.655 --> 28:11.455
Of our lord and saviour?
- I'm not interested.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.590
- Well, you see,
lost souls matter to god

28:13.659 --> 28:15.725
And so they matter to me.
So if you would just listen--

28:15.761 --> 28:18.395
- Miss, I'm trying to do my job.
So if you could please
just move?

28:18.464 --> 28:19.997
- I will do no such thing!

28:20.132 --> 28:22.266
I know that you are trailing
those women and I demand

28:22.401 --> 28:23.934
To know why, in the name
of all that is holy!

28:25.471 --> 28:28.338
- Excuse me, ma'am! If you don't
stop, I'll have no choice

28:28.340 --> 28:30.741
But to arrest you.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.343
- What on earth have I done
to warrant being arrested?

28:35.414 --> 28:38.815
- Well, I--I not--noticed your
condition and I thought--

28:38.851 --> 28:41.618
- You thought what?
- Ma'am, I am a member

28:41.620 --> 28:44.021
Of the toronto police department
and you'd do well to respect me
as such.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.892
- I beg your pardon.
What do you need?

28:49.027 --> 28:51.895
- Well, I notice
your condition

28:51.931 --> 28:54.230
And I also notice that you
aren't wearing a wedding ring,

28:54.266 --> 28:56.500
So I thought, being
a morality officer,

28:56.569 --> 28:58.902
Maybe we should have a little
chat about morality.

28:59.037 --> 29:01.004
Who is the father
of your child?

29:01.006 --> 29:02.906
(sobbing)

29:02.975 --> 29:05.175
(sobbing and sniffling)

29:06.512 --> 29:08.111
There, there.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.714
- Well, if you don't tell me,
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to call the police.

29:10.849 --> 29:14.017
- There's no need for that.
- Will you stop following
those women?

29:14.019 --> 29:17.187
- I can't do that, miss.
I'm on official rcmp business.

29:17.322 --> 29:21.257
- What kind of business?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.660
- I'm on business, too.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.462
- I thought you were
a missionary?

29:26.499 --> 29:28.632
- I'm actually investigating
a life insurance claim.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.134
- Is this is about
penelope weinman?

29:31.203 --> 29:33.937
- Could be. Why?

29:33.973 --> 29:36.306
- We need to talk.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.411
- Did you bring the note
you received, mr. Easton?

29:41.413 --> 29:44.147
- I did.
- Oh. Great.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.351
"I eagerly await
one hundred kisses

29:47.486 --> 29:49.820
"behind the bar on Friday.

29:49.822 --> 29:52.422
Or shall we meet
in your office instead?"

29:52.424 --> 29:55.492
Oh, please-- have a seat.
This is identical to the note

29:55.627 --> 29:58.228
That kelvin received,
but how is it blackmail?

29:58.363 --> 30:00.164
- It's a code.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.633
- So one hundred kisses
means one hundred dollars?

30:03.669 --> 30:05.969
- Yes. To be left
behind the bar.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.638
And if I don't pay...

30:08.674 --> 30:11.908
- They will reveal that you are
a regular at the flower shop.

30:11.944 --> 30:15.179
- And everything
that goes on there.
- To your colleagues.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.315
- Musicians are
fairly permissive,

30:18.450 --> 30:21.017
But if management
found out...

30:21.053 --> 30:23.153
- I understand.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.522
What can you tell me
about henrietta collins--

30:25.657 --> 30:28.157
The woman on the postcard?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.193
- Just that she's
quite a performer.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.963
- Do you think she could be
the blackmailer?

30:33.098 --> 30:35.198
- Miss drake,

30:35.267 --> 30:37.934
When you live
the sort of life I do,

30:38.070 --> 30:41.538
Anyone who knows about it has
the power to take advantage.

30:44.577 --> 30:47.077
- You are never going to believe
this. Nathan and eloise?

30:47.079 --> 30:49.680
They're not just having an
affair-- they're having a baby!

30:49.815 --> 30:51.347
- Really?

30:51.383 --> 30:54.083
- I bet nathan cooked up this
explosion to get rid of penelope

30:54.119 --> 30:56.152
So he'd be free to marry eloise.

30:56.154 --> 30:58.688
- Nathan didn't cook up
the explosion.

30:58.724 --> 31:01.491
- Was it art girard?
Because if we could prove that--

31:01.493 --> 31:04.360
- It was the rcmp.
- What?

31:05.598 --> 31:09.299
What? The royal canadian mounted
police murdered a woman?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.701
- No, but they did
set the explosion.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.770
Penelope's alive.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.106
It was a cover to get her
into witness protection.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.842
- Witness protection?
- Yeah.

31:18.911 --> 31:22.612
She's going to be testifying
against the girard organization.

31:22.615 --> 31:25.916
- Well, does that mean
case closed for us?

31:25.918 --> 31:28.852
- Hardly. I can't tell shep
that penelope's alive.

31:28.921 --> 31:32.455
It'll risk the rcmp's case
and penelope's safety.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.091
- Well, what happens
if you don't tell him?

31:35.093 --> 31:38.395
- Shep pays nathan's claim
and then fires us

31:38.397 --> 31:41.131
Once he finds out
that she's alive?

31:43.502 --> 31:45.135
- I can't believe
I'm going to say this,

31:45.270 --> 31:47.770
But it would be so much easier
if penelope was dead.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.743
(mysterious jazz music)

32:06.892 --> 32:09.559
- Great mother methuselah.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.831
- Hey! What're you
doing back there?

32:14.900 --> 32:16.499
- Uh...

32:18.837 --> 32:21.838
- Excuse me?
- No. No autographs
'til after the show.

32:21.874 --> 32:24.641
- No, I'm not here
for an autograph.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.177
Take a look
at the back.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.312
- This supposed
to be a fan letter?

32:29.315 --> 32:32.515
- Blackmail note. And several
of the patrons received them.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.584
- And?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.719
- Your picture is on the back
of all of them.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.656
I mean, who besides you would
have access to these?

32:39.658 --> 32:41.792
- Only anyone who's
ever seen me sing.

32:41.927 --> 32:45.061
I put them out
whenever I perform.
I had nothing to do with this.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.096
(engine starting)
- thank you.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.942
- Same handwriting.
So much for staying out

32:59.077 --> 33:01.878
Of people's business, max.

33:09.288 --> 33:12.622
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Not until she explains
herself.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.557
- Not until you explain
yourself.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.227
- These are my tips! I don't
know who this woman really is,

33:17.229 --> 33:19.362
Max, but she's
no friend of ours.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.965
- She's a friend of mine!
- And mine.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.934
- What? You're a detective?
- In my spare time.

33:23.936 --> 33:25.869
- Ok! Out of here,
both of you!

33:26.004 --> 33:29.039
- Oh, you are not in any
position to be making demands.

33:29.174 --> 33:32.575
You've been blackmailing
your clientele?
- She's the blackmailer?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.478
But you said that alistair was--

33:34.480 --> 33:36.513
- You told her I was
blackmailing people?

33:36.648 --> 33:38.515
- Ok, look, I may have
insinuated because--

33:38.584 --> 33:40.450
- Thanks a lot, max. I quit.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.520
- You don't understand.
- Then enlighten us.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.755
- You think it costs nothing
to keep a place like this open?

33:45.758 --> 33:47.791
Look, the protection fees
alone, they--
- whoa-whoa-whoa!

33:47.860 --> 33:50.060
Protection fees?
- Yeah. You think it's just luck

33:50.195 --> 33:53.530
That the police aren't in here
every single night raiding
like they did last night?

33:53.599 --> 33:55.932
- So you pass the extortion on
to the customers?

33:55.968 --> 33:58.702
- Only the rich guys
like kelvin.
- Well, kelvin's company

33:58.704 --> 34:01.271
Isn't doing very well
because of the money
that he's been funneling you.

34:01.340 --> 34:05.075
- He was always so flush, uh--
- appearances can be deceiving.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.078
So how did you slip him
the aconite that killed him?

34:08.080 --> 34:10.146
- I don't know
anything about that.

34:10.182 --> 34:13.416
- Kelvin was poisoned
six hours before he died.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.884
- And he was here all night.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.554
- Ok, but he didn't even come
in here until almost nine.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.623
- You sure about that?
- Yeah. I gave him a heads-up

34:19.625 --> 34:21.758
Right before the show started,
you know? I didn't want to--

34:21.760 --> 34:23.893
Didn't want him
to miss elsa.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.363
- Heads up about what?
Where was he?

34:26.498 --> 34:29.932
- He was back in the alley,
arguing with some old guy
in a three-piece suit.

34:32.037 --> 34:33.336
- The money clip.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.308
Kelvin wasn't the km
that it belonged to.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.980
- Why did you drag me down here?

34:43.982 --> 34:45.982
- I thought
you might want this.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.987
- So, did you poison your son
because he was a homosexual?

34:50.989 --> 34:53.857
- Or because he was
stealing company funds?

34:53.859 --> 34:57.127
- I may not have agreed
with kelvin's choices,

34:57.129 --> 35:00.196
But I did not kill my son.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.732
- Well, then what were you doing
in the alley the night
that he died?

35:02.734 --> 35:05.802
- Trying to help him out of the
mess he had gotten himself into.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.037
- You knew about the blackmail?

35:08.073 --> 35:11.074
- All he had to do to make it go
away was to give up this place.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.443
- And the man he loved.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.878
- We've all made sacrifices.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.214
- It still doesn't explain
what you were doing here.

35:18.250 --> 35:22.085
- I followed kelvin hoping
to pay off the blackmailer

35:22.154 --> 35:25.222
Once and for all.
Cleared out my savings.

35:25.224 --> 35:28.492
- The five hundred dollars.
- But kelvin didn't want
my money.

35:28.627 --> 35:32.295
He smacked it
right out of my hand.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.764
- Which is how it ended
underneath the dumpster.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.634
- So how did the money
get into kelvin's pocket?

35:37.703 --> 35:41.237
- He eventually realised it was
the only way. He took it.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.374
I went home.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.842
As for what happened
after that...

35:46.879 --> 35:49.045
I can't bear to think about it.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.117
- Thank you for stopping by.
- Does this mean

35:54.119 --> 35:56.786
You're finished investigating
and I can have my money?

35:56.855 --> 35:59.222
- The investigation is complete,
yes. I just need you

35:59.357 --> 36:01.090
To sign this.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.960
- What the hell is this?

36:04.095 --> 36:06.529
- Well, it's a simple
legal document

36:06.565 --> 36:09.132
Withdrawing your life
insurance claim.
- And why would I do that?

36:10.335 --> 36:12.702
- I'm glad you asked.
I'll show you.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.477
- Eloise is just a friend.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.579
- That looks like more than
friendship to me, mr. Weinman.

36:22.648 --> 36:26.082
- Our relationship has evolved
since penelope died,

36:26.084 --> 36:28.418
But can you blame me?

36:28.487 --> 36:31.053
Eloise has been a comfort.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.556
- Judging by her condition,

36:33.592 --> 36:35.492
She's been more than a comfort

36:35.627 --> 36:38.094
Since well before
penelope's death.

36:39.698 --> 36:43.232
So, tell me: Art girard know
you knocked up his daughter?

36:44.870 --> 36:47.837
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Great.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.672
Here's the pen.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.744
(dramatic music)

36:58.516 --> 37:01.684
- (cook): Order up!
- (waitress): I'll be
right there.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.988
- Hello, ladies!
- Hey.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.856
- Why are you two so glum?

37:06.992 --> 37:09.125
- Why are you so chipper?

37:09.127 --> 37:12.328
- I twisted my way out of a jam
with shep and got paid
for my trouble.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.364
- Hm.
- Now you go.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.933
- We hit a dead end in our case.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.801
- Ah, do you want
to talk it out?
- Thanks, trudy,

37:18.870 --> 37:21.338
But I don't see what good
it will do.
- Flo.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.873
- I'm sorry, frankie. I don't
mean to be a downer, but--

37:23.942 --> 37:26.142
- No, flo! You-you have
to see this.

37:26.178 --> 37:29.012
"macdonald and sons
set to expand".

37:29.081 --> 37:31.580
- Expanding? During
financial troubles?

37:31.617 --> 37:34.717
- Looks like the new president
isn't as useless as he wanted me
to believe.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.453
- No more dead end?

37:37.522 --> 37:39.388
- More like a gnarled
family tree.

37:41.559 --> 37:45.161
You're making a lot of big moves
for someone who claims they
don't have a head for business.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.964
Did you plan the expansion
before kelvin was killed?

37:48.099 --> 37:51.034
- I don't think I like what
you're insinuating, ms. Drake.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.969
- She's not
insinuating anything.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.638
- I didn't kill my brother.
- Then answer the question.

37:55.641 --> 37:59.843
- This expansion was decided
upon yesterday.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.977
It was a last-ditch effort
to save the company.

38:02.014 --> 38:03.980
- It-it wouldn't happen
in a day.
- No,

38:04.049 --> 38:06.383
But beatrice had the plans
drawn up and--
- who's beatrice?

38:06.518 --> 38:09.252
- She's our secretary. Although
the title belies the work

38:09.387 --> 38:11.588
She does.
She's been a godsend.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.724
- The expansion was
beatrice's idea?
- Mm-hmm.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.794
- She's no godsend.
She's the killer.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.396
And you're her pawn.
(incredulous laugh)

38:20.465 --> 38:22.332
- Excuse me?

38:22.467 --> 38:24.401
- Beatrice wanted to be
more than just a secretary.

38:24.536 --> 38:27.803
- No, no. That never would have
happened while kelvin was
in charge. I...

38:27.839 --> 38:31.407
- So she killed him.
- Because she knew you were
going to take over.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.079
- And I'd need her help.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.548
- She'd finally get the power
she always wanted.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.450
- So, how do we prove it?

38:41.486 --> 38:43.619
- We give her
what she wants.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.564
- I came as quickly as I could,
mr. Macdonald.

38:54.699 --> 38:57.434
Is everything all right?
- More than all right.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.668
Have a seat.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.445
I thought we should
have a toast

39:09.481 --> 39:13.049
To your new role
as vice president.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.386
- Vice president? Huh.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.221
Me?
- Mm-hmm.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.190
No one has shown
the commitment

39:21.226 --> 39:23.660
To the company like you.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.195
To you, beatrice.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.602
(door opening)

39:33.638 --> 39:36.939
- You really should be more
careful who you accept
drinks from.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.275
- You never know
what could be in them.

39:39.277 --> 39:42.011
- What are you doing here?

39:42.013 --> 39:44.847
And what...?

39:47.319 --> 39:49.752
What did you do?

39:49.755 --> 39:53.088
- Exactly what you did
to kelvin.
- But unlike you,

39:53.125 --> 39:55.425
We have the cure.

39:57.696 --> 40:00.496
- What do you want?
- Your confession.

40:04.870 --> 40:08.471
- Fine. I did it.

40:09.808 --> 40:13.176
But you have no idea
how they treated me.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.578
I've been the brains
of this place

40:15.647 --> 40:18.181
Ever since old man macdonald
put kelvin in charge.

40:18.183 --> 40:21.251
And what did I get
for it? Nothing!

40:21.386 --> 40:23.386
- Except, perhaps,
a pay cheque?

40:23.521 --> 40:25.955
- A pittance!

40:26.090 --> 40:28.791
And after I saw
the financial statements,

40:28.860 --> 40:31.661
I knew that if I didn't do
something, the business
would go under.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.797
And I wouldn't even have that.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.601
I didn't sacrifice
15 years of my life

40:38.603 --> 40:40.803
To lose everything.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.339
- No. You sacrificed
your future.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.943
- Uh, 'kay, wait...

40:47.012 --> 40:49.478
I confessed.

40:49.514 --> 40:50.880
Where's the antidote?

40:50.916 --> 40:53.749
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

40:53.751 --> 40:56.152
- The poison. For heaven's sake!
- You really think

40:56.287 --> 40:59.355
That we would go to all that
trouble just for a confession?

40:59.357 --> 41:01.223
We're not monsters.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.842

41:25.917 --> 41:29.319
- Was in a place like this.
- It's amazing.

41:29.454 --> 41:33.189
Hey! How did you get the rcmp
to move on the girard case?

41:33.324 --> 41:36.926
It's the talk of the station--
nathan being charged
with money laundering!

41:36.928 --> 41:39.462

- wow!

41:39.597 --> 41:41.664

41:41.700 --> 41:43.532
Arrests were coming
so soon, ach,

41:43.568 --> 41:46.836
I wouldn't have pushed nathan
to revoke his claim.
- Wow.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.805
All's well that
ends well, I guess.

About the whole blackmail thing.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.027
- Protection fees are covered
for the foreseeable future,

42:11.096 --> 42:13.362
Thanks to a donation
from a friend.

42:13.431 --> 42:16.332
Kelvin's brother.
You have a good night.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.436
- Wow. Blackmail.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.772
Sounds like you had
an eventful last few days.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.707
- Not the kind
of eventful that I like.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.676
Maybe we can
make up for that later?
- I would have it no other way.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.580
