01:11.739 --> 01:13.675
THIS MUST
BE THE PLACE.

01:13.676 --> 01:16.147
WHAT DOES
THE SIGN SAY?

01:16.148 --> 01:17.815
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

01:17.816 --> 01:20.253
LET'S GO BUST IN
AND FIND OUT.

01:24.094 --> 01:26.098
OK, BOSS, WE'RE
INSIDE THE PLANT.

01:26.099 --> 01:27.567
NOW WHAT?

01:27.568 --> 01:31.240
GET
THOSE ENERGY MODULES,
YOU BUG-BRAINED BABOON.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.509
AND HURRY!

01:32.510 --> 01:33.845
WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF POWER.

01:33.846 --> 01:37.285
COME ON! THIS'LL BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.728
RIGHT,
UPSIDE DOWN CAKE.

01:42.729 --> 01:44.698
THE TURTLES.

01:44.699 --> 01:47.436
CORRECTAMUNDO,
PORK PUSS.

01:47.437 --> 01:51.377
HEY, HOW'D YOU KNOW
WE WAS GONNA HIT
THIS PLACE?

01:51.378 --> 01:53.446
SIMPLE. IT'S
THE ONLY POWER PLANT
IN TOWN

01:53.447 --> 01:55.183
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
HIT YET.

01:55.184 --> 01:59.558
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE TO
BRIGHTEN A REPORTER'S DAY.

01:59.559 --> 02:00.927
PACK IT IN, CHUMP.

02:00.928 --> 02:02.898
YOU HAVEN'T
GOT A PRAYER.

02:02.899 --> 02:05.503
AW, YOU WOULDN'T HURT A GUY,
WOULD YOU?

02:05.504 --> 02:09.376
MAYBE HE WOULDN'T,
BUT I WOULD.

02:10.679 --> 02:13.216
OUT OF MY WAY,
SHELL BACKS!

02:13.217 --> 02:17.090
YO, BEBOP!
WAIT FOR ME.

02:17.091 --> 02:18.960
ARE YOU OK, DUDE?

02:18.961 --> 02:21.197
OH, NEVER MIND ME.

02:21.198 --> 02:23.735
LET'S GET THOSE
MUSCLE-BOUND MUTANTS.

02:23.736 --> 02:26.641
TURTLES FIGHT
WITH HONOR!

02:26.642 --> 02:28.276
HOW ABOUT IF I
JUST FIGHT WITH
THIS STUFF?

02:30.782 --> 02:31.849
I CAN'T MOVE!

02:31.850 --> 02:34.722
THIS STUFF'S
LIKE CHEWING GUM.

02:34.723 --> 02:39.230
SHREDDER, GET THE BOYS
ON THE COMLINK.

02:39.231 --> 02:41.868
I'M TRYING! BUT
I'M LOSING THE SIGNAL.

02:41.869 --> 02:44.640
BLAST! WE'RE
OUT OF POWER.

02:46.377 --> 02:48.180
AND I THOUGHT
YOU'D JUST FORGOTTEN

02:48.181 --> 02:51.184
TO PAY
THE ELECTRIC BILL.

02:51.185 --> 02:54.492
OK, WHAT ARE
YOU TWO UP TO
THIS TIME?

02:54.493 --> 02:58.465
CRAM IT IN YOUR SHELL,
WIMP.

02:58.466 --> 03:02.138
SMART ANSWER,
BUT DUMB MOVE.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.778
GRAB ON, BEBOP.

03:05.779 --> 03:07.983
I...GOT IT!

03:07.984 --> 03:11.623
WHOA, STRETCH CITY.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.623
QUICK. GRAB THEM BEFORE--

03:16.164 --> 03:17.365
YOU WERE SAYING...

03:20.206 --> 03:22.441
COME ON.
LET'S BLOW THIS JOINT.

03:24.547 --> 03:26.182
THEY'RE
GETTING AWAY!

03:28.186 --> 03:31.024
UH, WRONG TENSE--
THEY GOT AWAY.

03:31.025 --> 03:33.562
HEY, AMIGOS,
AT LEAST WE STOPPED THEM

03:33.563 --> 03:36.433
FROM CONSUMMATING WHATEVER
NEFARIOUS SCHEME

03:36.434 --> 03:38.170
THEY WERE ATTEMPTING.

03:38.171 --> 03:39.774
WELL, THIS WAS BOUND
TO HAPPEN,

03:39.775 --> 03:43.447
EVER SINCE WE
HOOKED UP TO THAT
EDUCATIONAL TV STATION.

03:43.448 --> 03:45.183
I'D LOVE TO STAY
AND CHAT, GUYS,

03:45.184 --> 03:46.251
BUT I'VE GOT
TO DO A STORY

03:46.252 --> 03:49.190
ON THE SECURITY PROGRAM
AT FORT CHARLES.

03:49.191 --> 03:50.525
FORT CHARLES?

03:50.526 --> 03:53.465
THAT'S THE NEW
MILITARY SUPERCOMPUTER
INSTALLATION.

03:53.466 --> 03:57.572
UH-HUH. THEY'RE STORING
SOME TOP-SECRET
ENERGY SOURCE THERE.

03:57.573 --> 03:58.673
CALL ME CRAZY,

03:58.674 --> 04:00.812
BUT I THINK THERE'S
A PATTERN HERE.

04:00.813 --> 04:03.382
EVERY PLANT
THOSE BOZOS HAVE
TRIED TO BREAK INTO

04:03.383 --> 04:05.554
HAS BEEN DOING
ENERGY RESEARCH.

04:06.957 --> 04:10.396
THEY'RE AFTER POWER
FOR THE TECHNODROME
IN EVERY EPISODE.

04:10.397 --> 04:14.269
RIGHT, BUT I THINK
THEIR SITUATION
IS GETTING WORSE.

04:14.270 --> 04:15.638
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS TIME

04:15.639 --> 04:18.010
THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
THEIR STUN LASERS.

04:18.011 --> 04:20.413
I BET THEY DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH ENERGY LEFT
TO POWER THEM.

04:20.414 --> 04:22.250
SO WHAT DOES
ALL THIS MEAN?

04:22.251 --> 04:25.690
IT MEANS
THAT FORT CHARLES
COULD BE A TARGET,

04:25.691 --> 04:29.262
AND APRIL IS ON
HER WAY THERE.

04:30.733 --> 04:33.604
COME ON,
SOMEBODY OPEN THIS THING!

04:33.605 --> 04:37.812
HEY, WHY ARE
THE LIGHTS OUT?

04:37.813 --> 04:41.051
MAYBE IT'S
A SURPRISE PARTY.

04:41.052 --> 04:44.056
YEOW, IT'S FRANKULA!

04:44.057 --> 04:48.665
NO WAY.
IT'S DRACKENSTEIN.

04:48.666 --> 04:51.135
IT'S ME, YOU IDIOTS.

04:51.136 --> 04:53.072
OH, HI, BOSS.

04:53.073 --> 04:57.014
UH, BOSS,
HOW COME IT'S
SO DARK IN HERE?

04:57.015 --> 04:59.784
BECAUSE WE'RE
OUT OF POWER, REMEMBER?

04:59.785 --> 05:03.291
THAT'S WHY I SENT YOU
TO GET THOSE
ENERGY MODULES.

05:03.292 --> 05:04.627
DID YOU GET THEM?

05:04.628 --> 05:07.198
WELL, UH,
MORE OR LESS.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.068
MORE OR LESS?

05:09.069 --> 05:12.107
UM, ACTUALLY LESS.

05:12.108 --> 05:15.012
ACTUALLY,
A LOT LESS.

05:15.013 --> 05:18.352
OH, YOU BLITHERING
BLISTERBRAINS!

05:18.353 --> 05:20.055
I OUGHT TO--

05:21.524 --> 05:22.894
WE'RE FALLING!

05:22.895 --> 05:27.301
SHREDDER, THE LEDGE WE'RE ON
IS STARTING TO CRUMBLE.

05:27.302 --> 05:30.106
REALLY.
YOU DON'T SAY.

05:30.107 --> 05:32.076
WE HAVE NO POWER

05:32.077 --> 05:34.080
FOR THE REFRIGERATION
UNITS.

05:34.081 --> 05:37.085
IF WE FALL
INTO THE LAVA,

05:37.086 --> 05:39.323
OUR GOOSE
WILL BE COOKED.

05:39.324 --> 05:42.929
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
AN ENERGY SOURCE
IMMEDIATELY!

05:42.930 --> 05:44.933
THIS IS APRIL O'NEIL,

05:44.934 --> 05:46.769
LIVE FROM FORT CHARLES--

05:46.770 --> 05:49.441
THE ARMY'S NEWEST
HIGH-TECH STORAGE CENTER.

05:49.442 --> 05:52.381
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
HEAVILY FORTIFIED PLACE

05:52.382 --> 05:54.083
ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

05:54.084 --> 05:56.654
GUARDED BY LASER CANNONS,
FORCE FIELDS,

05:56.655 --> 05:58.658
AND ROBOTIC SOLDIER DRONES,

05:58.659 --> 05:59.559
AND ALL OF IT CONTROLLED

05:59.560 --> 06:01.529
BY A SINGLE
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT--

06:01.530 --> 06:02.999
CYCLOP,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.839
THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
COMPUTER EVER BUILT.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.146
WHOA, LOOKS LIKE MONDO
MAXIMO SECURITY TO ME.

06:10.147 --> 06:12.650
LET'S HOPE IT'S ENOUGH
TO KEEP SHREDDER
AND HIS CREEPS

06:12.651 --> 06:15.155
FROM TRYING TO GET
THAT ENERGY SOURCE.

06:15.156 --> 06:17.659
ALL THIS SECURITY
IS TO PROTECT

06:17.660 --> 06:19.663
WHAT'S INSIDE
THIS AIRTIGHT VAULT--

06:19.664 --> 06:22.668
THE ONLY TRILITHIUM
CRYSTAL IN EXISTENCE

06:22.669 --> 06:26.108
AND THE MOST POWERFUL
ENERGY SOURCE KNOWN TO MAN.

06:26.109 --> 06:29.348
TRILITHIUM.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.652
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR SKULL?

06:31.653 --> 06:33.488
HA HA!
LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

06:33.489 --> 06:35.024
OH, VERY FUNNY.

06:35.025 --> 06:38.530
EVEN IF WE COULD
GET PAST THOSE DEFENSES,

06:38.531 --> 06:40.901
THE CRYSTAL
IS HIGHLY UNSTABLE.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.472
IT COULD BLOW US
ALL TO ATOMS.

06:43.473 --> 06:44.541
VERY TRUE.

06:44.542 --> 06:45.876
BUT I WANT THE TURTLES

06:45.877 --> 06:47.880
TO THINK WE'RE STEALING
THE CRYSTAL

06:47.881 --> 06:49.183
WHILE WE GET
THE ENERGY

06:49.184 --> 06:51.487
TO REPOWER
THE TECHNODROME
ELSEWHERE.

06:51.488 --> 06:55.494
YOU'RE USING UP
WHAT LITTLE POWER
WE HAVE LEFT.

06:55.495 --> 06:58.935
IT WILL BE WORTH IT.
TRUST ME.

06:58.936 --> 07:00.503
TRUST ME.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.708
I'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE.

07:02.709 --> 07:04.243
EXTERNAL SIGNAL DETECTED.

07:04.244 --> 07:07.249
PASSWORD OVERRIDE ACCEPTED.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.455
NEW PROGRAMMING INPUT
ACKNOWLEDGED.

07:10.456 --> 07:12.292
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:12.293 --> 07:15.531
REPROGRAMMING CYCLOP
BY REMOTE CONTROL.

07:15.532 --> 07:19.605
BOSS,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:22.211 --> 07:24.915
HEY, ROCKSTEADY,
WHERE DID YOU--

07:24.916 --> 07:26.952
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

07:26.953 --> 07:30.459
GET OFF ME, YOU
HORN-HEADED KLUTZ!

07:30.460 --> 07:32.428
SORRY, BOSS.

07:32.429 --> 07:35.668
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE
SATISFIED, SHREDDER.

07:35.669 --> 07:39.875
NOW WE'RE COMPLETELY
OUT OF POWER.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.148
YES,
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

07:43.149 --> 07:46.253
ATTENTION, COMBAT DRONES.

07:46.254 --> 07:50.127
PREPARE TO INPUT
NEW PROGRAMMING IMMEDIATELY.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.618
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

08:04.653 --> 08:06.022
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

08:09.897 --> 08:11.265
WHAT IN THE HECK?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.817
THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

08:21.818 --> 08:23.788
IT APPEARS
AS IF THE ROBOT DRONES

08:23.789 --> 08:26.526
ARE CLEARING THE FORT
OF EVERY LIVING PERSON.

08:27.696 --> 08:29.632
THIS IS APRIL O'NEIL

08:29.633 --> 08:31.201
BEING SIGNED OFF.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.610
I KNEW IT.

08:35.611 --> 08:38.448
SHREDDER
HAS REPROGRAMMED
THAT ARMY COMPUTER.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.285
AND APRIL'S TRAPPED
IN THAT AIRTIGHT VAULT!

08:41.287 --> 08:42.922
AND IF IT ISN'T
OPENED SOON,

08:42.923 --> 08:45.059
SHE'LL SUFFOCATE.

08:53.442 --> 08:54.878
POUR IT ON, GUYS.

08:54.879 --> 08:58.217
WE'VE GOT TO RESCUE APRIL
BEFORE HER AIR RUNS OUT.

08:58.218 --> 09:02.157
HOW COME WE CAN'T EVER
HAVE A NICE LEISURELY
EMERGENCY?

09:02.158 --> 09:05.730
THIS IS VERNON FENWICK
FOR CHANNEL 6 NEWS,

09:05.731 --> 09:09.404
REPORTING
FROM FORT CHARLES LIVE.

09:09.405 --> 09:11.441
THE SITUATION HERE
APPEARS HOPELESS.

09:11.442 --> 09:14.915
THE ARMY'S OWN WEAPONS
HAVE TURNED AGAINST THEM.

09:14.916 --> 09:16.918
DESPITE THE PERSONAL
DANGER,

09:16.919 --> 09:20.490
CHANNEL 6'S COVERAGE OF
THIS CRISIS WILL CONTINUE.

09:21.593 --> 09:23.496
AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

09:24.766 --> 09:27.670
PEDAL FASTER.
THE SCREEN'S GOING DARK.

09:29.107 --> 09:31.243
THIS IS THE STORY
OF MY LIFE--

09:31.244 --> 09:36.086
PEDALING LIKE CRAZY
AND NOT GOING NOWHERE.

09:36.087 --> 09:39.091
MY PLAN
IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

09:39.092 --> 09:41.395
THE TURTLES SHOULD
BE THERE SOON.

09:41.396 --> 09:43.800
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN
STOP PEDALING NOW.

09:43.801 --> 09:48.175
I'M GLAD
THEY AIN'T WATCHING
SOME MINISERIES.

09:48.176 --> 09:50.144
NOW DO YOU APPRECIATE

09:50.145 --> 09:53.017
THE BRILLIANCE
OF MY PLAN?

09:53.018 --> 09:54.986
OH, IT'S NOT BAD

09:54.987 --> 09:57.491
FOR A PEA-BRAINED HUMAN,

09:57.492 --> 10:01.231
BUT WHERE DO YOU INTEND
TO GET THE POWER SUPPLY?

10:01.232 --> 10:03.602
FROM
THE MALYK MISSILE PLANT.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.007
WITH THOSE PESKY TURTLES
BUSY AT THE FORT,

10:06.008 --> 10:10.014
EVEN YOUR IDIOTIC MUTANTS
SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE

10:10.015 --> 10:12.018
STEALING
THE POWER PACKS.

10:12.019 --> 10:14.489
WHY IS IT
WHENEVER THEY
MAKE A MISTAKE,

10:14.490 --> 10:17.293
THEY'RE MY
IDIOTIC MUTANTS?

10:17.294 --> 10:18.797
GET TO THAT
MISSILE PLANT.

10:21.736 --> 10:25.008
GET OFF ME,
YOU KLUTZES.

10:25.009 --> 10:27.212
AND GET TO THE SURFACE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

10:30.051 --> 10:32.321
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY LEFT THE SEWER LINE

10:32.322 --> 10:33.624
TO THIS PLACE UNGUARDED.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.562
THAT'S
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
FOR YOU.

10:36.563 --> 10:39.568
THIS WON'T BE
SO HARD AFTER ALL.

10:42.273 --> 10:44.744
WELL, MAYBE
A LITTLE HARD.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.113
THAT CAMERA
IS TARGETING US

10:46.114 --> 10:47.481
FOR THOSE LASERS!

10:47.482 --> 10:49.217
WE'VE GOT TO SHUT IT DOWN!

10:49.218 --> 10:52.557
LEAVE IT
TO YOURS TRULY, BUD.

10:55.498 --> 10:58.435
SWELL. ANOTHER DOZEN
DEATH-DEALING TRAPS LIKE THIS

10:58.436 --> 11:00.372
AND WE'LL BE DONE
FOR THE DAY.

11:00.373 --> 11:02.509
THEN WE BETTER
GET GOING.

11:05.247 --> 11:08.086
STILL NO WORD
ON THE CONDITION
OF APRIL O'NEIL,

11:08.087 --> 11:10.591
WHO'S IMPRISONED
INSIDE THE VAULT.

11:10.592 --> 11:14.498
OFFICIALS WARN US
THE AIR WON'T LAST
MORE THAN ANOTHER HOUR.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.933
BUT NEVER FEAR,

11:15.934 --> 11:18.438
IF MISS O'NEIL SHOULD...
EXPIRE...

11:18.439 --> 11:21.443
I SHALL CARRY ON
IN HER PLACE,

11:21.444 --> 11:23.681
AND AT A RAISE
IN SALARY.

11:34.835 --> 11:37.373
WE'RE AT
THE MISSILE PLANT.

11:37.374 --> 11:38.674
NO, WE AIN'T.

11:38.675 --> 11:40.344
WE'RE IN FRONT OF
THE FOUNTAIN

11:40.345 --> 11:42.615
IN FRONT OF
THE MISSILE PLANT.

11:42.616 --> 11:44.619
AH, CLOSE ENOUGH.

11:45.521 --> 11:46.755
YEAH, BOSS?

11:46.756 --> 11:48.759
HURRY UP AND
GET THOSE POWER PACKS.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.030
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

11:57.442 --> 12:01.048
DON'T YOU JUST
LOVE THIS PART?

12:03.654 --> 12:07.293
TURTLES,
PLEASE HURRY.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.097
THIS WAY, GUYS.

12:12.403 --> 12:15.642
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY
ANOTHER ROOM, HUH, GUYS?

12:15.643 --> 12:19.115
NOW I KNOW HOW
A HIGHWAY FEELS.

12:19.116 --> 12:22.253
PREPARE TO BE TERMINATED.

12:22.254 --> 12:25.693
THE DIGITAL DUDE
MEANS BUSINESS, AMIGOS.

12:25.694 --> 12:29.433
MY HOROSCOPE SAID
I SHOULD SETTLE ALL
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

12:29.434 --> 12:33.307
TRY INTERFACING WITH THIS,
CHROME DOME.

12:33.308 --> 12:36.713
I THINK THAT
WAS A BAD IDEA.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.117
QUICK, INTO
THE VENTILATION SHAFTS!

12:39.118 --> 12:40.954
BODACIOUS NOTION, DUDE,

12:40.955 --> 12:43.024
BEFORE WE
GET VENTILATED.

12:43.025 --> 12:45.095
HURRY, LET'S MOVE IT!

12:45.096 --> 12:47.032
WHEW, THAT WAS CLOSE.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.637
PRIMO IDEA,
LEONARDO.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.375
WE WON'T RUN IN
TO ANY DRONES HERE.

12:54.947 --> 12:56.782
SOME KIND OF ROBOT RAFT.

12:57.685 --> 12:59.320
OH, THERE'S
ONLY ONE.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.757
LET'S KEEP MOVING.

13:00.758 --> 13:02.559
HURRY UP, RAPHAEL.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.131
HEY, I'M A TORTOISE,
NOT A HARE, OK?

13:06.068 --> 13:07.902
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.075
COME IN, TURTLES.

13:11.076 --> 13:13.580
PLEASE HURRY.

13:13.581 --> 13:16.251
NOT MUCH AIR LEFT.

13:16.252 --> 13:17.787
LOOK OUT!

13:19.092 --> 13:21.928
WE'LL GET OUT
THIS WAY.

13:23.199 --> 13:24.633
FOLLOW ME.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.876
NOW, DON'T YOU KIDS
AT HOME TRY THIS.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.380
WE'RE
TRAINED PROFESSIONALS.

13:31.381 --> 13:32.981
THE SIGNAL IS
STRONGER.

13:32.982 --> 13:34.651
WE MUST BE ON
THE RIGHT FLOOR.

13:35.721 --> 13:36.722
10th FLOOR--

13:36.723 --> 13:38.391
KILLER ROBOTS
AND TRILITHIUM CRYSTALS.

13:43.368 --> 13:46.573
THIS IS WORKING
LIKE A CHARM.

13:46.574 --> 13:51.215
YEAH. IT'S NICE
TO BE ABLE TO COMMIT A CRIME

13:51.216 --> 13:54.554
WITHOUT THEM
TURTLES AROUND.

13:54.555 --> 13:57.392
YOU FOLKS OUT THERE
JUST THINK OF ME

13:57.393 --> 13:59.396
AS THE KIND OF REPORTER
WHO'S WILLING TO GET A STORY

13:59.397 --> 14:01.266
NO MATTER
WHAT THE DANGER.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.102
NOOO!

14:03.103 --> 14:05.607
THIS IS VERNON FENWICK...

14:05.608 --> 14:07.143
SIGNING OFF.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.117
WE'RE NOT FAR NOW.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.056
HANG ON, APRIL,
WE'RE COMING!

14:14.057 --> 14:16.126
THAT'LL CLEAR
YOUR SINUSES.

14:16.127 --> 14:18.130
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
RAPHAEL?

14:18.131 --> 14:21.636
YEAH, BUT I'M AFRAID
THAT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

14:21.637 --> 14:23.173
LOOK!

14:26.981 --> 14:29.384
MORE KILLER DRONES.

14:29.385 --> 14:32.489
AND I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE HERE TO SELL US
VACUUM CLEANERS.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.069
TOTAL BUMMER, DUDES.

14:40.070 --> 14:41.339
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.507
WHEN I SAY DUCK...

14:42.508 --> 14:43.844
WE QUACK?

14:43.845 --> 14:45.780
WE DUCK!

14:47.752 --> 14:50.589
PRIMO IDEA, LEONARDO.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.260
MORE DRONES.

14:54.430 --> 14:56.167
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

14:56.168 --> 14:57.502
FOLLOW ME.

14:57.503 --> 15:00.040
SO, LIKE,
WHERE ARE WE HEADED?

15:00.041 --> 15:01.876
TO THE RESTROOM!

15:01.877 --> 15:03.413
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN CARE OF THAT

15:03.414 --> 15:05.183
BEFORE WE LEFT HOME,
DONATELLO.

15:05.184 --> 15:07.386
YOU NOTICE
HOW THEY'RE NEVER AROUND

15:07.387 --> 15:09.558
WHEN YOU REALLY NEED ONE.

15:09.559 --> 15:12.295
AT LAST,
WE FOUND ONE.

15:14.199 --> 15:16.102
NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.

15:16.103 --> 15:17.638
JUST GRAB A MIRROR.

15:17.639 --> 15:19.876
MIRRORS.
I GET IT!

15:19.877 --> 15:22.747
MONDO BRAINSTORM,
DONATELLO.

15:23.883 --> 15:26.287
HERE THEY COME.
GET READY.

15:30.095 --> 15:34.302
TURTLES--4.
ROBOTS--ZIPPO.

15:34.303 --> 15:35.638
THERE'LL BE MORE.

15:35.639 --> 15:36.807
WE'VE GOT TO SHUT DOWN
THE COMPUTER

15:36.808 --> 15:38.376
THAT'S CONTROLLING THEM.

15:38.377 --> 15:39.911
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO DO THAT

15:39.912 --> 15:42.650
WITHOUT
GETTING WASTED
BY THESE DRONES?

15:42.651 --> 15:46.056
I ALWAYS SAY
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM,
JOIN THEM.

15:46.992 --> 15:48.493
ROCKSTEADY HERE.

15:48.494 --> 15:50.665
IS THAT YOU, BOSS?

15:50.666 --> 15:52.936
NO, IT'S
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

15:52.937 --> 15:55.006
HEY, LET ME TALK
TO THAT CROOK.

15:55.007 --> 15:58.579
I LEFT MY
LITTLE BABY TUSK
UNDER MY PILLOW

15:58.580 --> 16:00.449
AND DIDN'T GET
NOTHING.

16:00.450 --> 16:03.254
HURRY AND GET THOSE
POWER PACKS BACK HERE.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.761
WHEN THE TURTLES REALIZE
WE'RE NOT AFTER
THE TRILITHIUM CRYSTAL,

16:06.762 --> 16:08.230
THEY'LL COME FOR YOU.

16:08.231 --> 16:10.701
WE CAN HANDLE THEM,
BOSS.

16:10.702 --> 16:12.972
YOU NEVER HAVE BEFORE.

16:15.577 --> 16:18.949
OH, I CAN'T STAND JUST
SITTING HERE IN THE DARK,

16:18.950 --> 16:20.418
NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S HAPPENING!

16:20.419 --> 16:23.156
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
USUALLY SITTING IN THE LIGHT,

16:23.157 --> 16:25.294
NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

16:25.295 --> 16:27.231
IF ONLY THERE WERE
SOME WAY

16:27.232 --> 16:30.403
TO GET ENOUGH POWER
TO RUN THE MONITOR
SCREENS.

16:31.673 --> 16:34.110
KRANG, HOW WOULD
YOU FEEL

16:34.111 --> 16:35.846
ABOUT A
LITTLE EXERCISE?

16:35.847 --> 16:38.685
THIS IS LIKE
HIGH-TECH HALLOWEEN.

16:38.686 --> 16:40.321
THIS JUST MIGHT WORK.

16:40.322 --> 16:42.860
I'M HOPING WE CAN FOOL
THAT SUPERCOMPUTER.

16:42.861 --> 16:46.933
PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK
WE COULD FOOL A SUNDIAL.

16:46.934 --> 16:48.903
STILL, IT'S OUR
ONLY CHANCE.

16:48.904 --> 16:51.742
COME ON,
APRIL'S TIME
IS RUNNING OUT.

16:51.743 --> 16:53.345
JUST IN CASE,

16:53.346 --> 16:56.752
HOW DO YOU SAY
"I SURRENDER" IN COMPUTERESE?

16:56.753 --> 16:59.790
THIS BETTER
WORK, SHREDDER!

16:59.791 --> 17:03.130
NEVER LET THEM
SEE YOU SWEAT.

17:03.131 --> 17:06.403
FASTER, KRANG.
FEEL THE BURN.

17:06.404 --> 17:08.605
WAIT A MINUTE--
I'M GETTING SOMETHING...

17:08.606 --> 17:10.276
THERE.

17:10.277 --> 17:13.147
OH, NO,
IT CAN'T BE!

17:13.148 --> 17:16.420
GREAT. THE TURTLES
ARE STILL ALIVE.

17:16.421 --> 17:18.156
NOT FOR LONG.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.827
THEY'RE HEADED
FOR THE CYCLOP'S
CHAMBER.

17:19.828 --> 17:23.834
THE COMPUTER
WILL RECOGNIZE
THEM INSTANTLY.

17:23.835 --> 17:28.342
OOPS. I WONDER IF THEY
MAKE ROBOT SUSPENDERS.

17:30.313 --> 17:32.616
WHAT A TIME
TO LOSE FACE.

17:32.617 --> 17:34.554
CAN YOU GET CLOSE
ENOUGH TO CYCLOP

17:34.555 --> 17:36.056
TO PULL THE PLUG?

17:36.057 --> 17:37.291
I'LL TRY.

17:39.597 --> 17:41.131
OW, THAT SMARTS!

17:42.735 --> 17:44.738
UH-OH. BAD MOVE.

17:44.739 --> 17:46.141
INTRUDER ALERT.

17:46.142 --> 17:48.578
INTRUDER ALERT.

17:48.579 --> 17:49.847
SHUT IT DOWN,
DONATELLO.

17:49.848 --> 17:51.050
WE'LL BUY YOU THE TIME.

17:52.753 --> 17:55.658
HAVE YOU TWO EVER MET
FACE-TO-FACE?

17:58.263 --> 17:59.765
IF SHREDDER COULD GET
INTO THIS COMPUTER,

17:59.766 --> 18:01.301
HOW TOUGH CAN IT BE?

18:01.302 --> 18:05.443
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE CANCELING
OUR TIME SLOT, DUDES.

18:05.444 --> 18:06.611
GOT IT!

18:06.612 --> 18:07.913
ALL RIGHT!

18:07.914 --> 18:10.352
WAY TO GO,
DONATELLO!

18:10.353 --> 18:11.820
CYCLOP'S DEACTIVATED,

18:11.821 --> 18:13.290
AND THAT MEANS...

18:13.291 --> 18:15.059
APRIL!

18:15.060 --> 18:17.196
W-WHO IS IT?

18:17.197 --> 18:21.772
THE CAVALRY
HAS ARRIVED, MA'AM.

18:21.773 --> 18:23.207
THE TURTLES.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.879
WHAT TOOK
YOU GUYS SO LONG?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.382
LET THAT BE
A LESSON, GUYS.

18:27.383 --> 18:29.152
NEVER KEEP A WOMAN WAITING.

18:29.153 --> 18:31.189
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

18:31.190 --> 18:33.059
THEY
SHUT DOWN CYCLOP.

18:33.060 --> 18:37.700
EXCELLENT. THAT MEANS
FORT CHARLES IS DEFENSELESS,

18:37.701 --> 18:42.443
AND THE TRILITHIUM CRYSTAL
IS UP FOR GRABS.

18:42.444 --> 18:44.780
THE TRILITHIUM
IS TOO UNSTABLE.

18:44.781 --> 18:47.252
BUT WE CAN'T
BEAT THE PRICE.

18:47.253 --> 18:50.558
BESIDES, YOUR MUTANTS
ARE SURE TO FAIL.

18:50.559 --> 18:53.463
OH, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO.

18:53.464 --> 18:56.334
AND DON'T COME
BACK WITHOUT IT!

18:56.335 --> 18:58.372
I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.

18:58.373 --> 19:01.678
BOY, DOES IT FEEL GOOD
TO BREATHE AGAIN.

19:01.679 --> 19:02.847
WE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE

19:02.848 --> 19:05.317
SO THE ARMY CAN GET
THAT VAULT CLOSED.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.854
YEAH, BUT I'M SURPRISED

19:06.855 --> 19:09.458
SHREDDER HASN'T COME
LOOKING FOR THE CRYSTAL.

19:09.459 --> 19:11.696
OH, LOOK OUT!

19:11.697 --> 19:13.599
YOU AND YOUR BIG MOUTH.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.803
OUT OF MY WAY,
TURTLES.

19:15.804 --> 19:17.372
I WANT THAT CRYSTAL.

19:18.777 --> 19:21.079
ONE MORE STEP,
SHREDDER,

19:21.080 --> 19:24.085
AND KA-BOOM GOES
THE CRYSTAL.

19:24.086 --> 19:25.854
YOU'RE BLUFFING, TURTLE.

19:25.855 --> 19:28.827
YOU WOULDN'T
DESTROY YOURSELF
AND YOUR FRIENDS

19:28.828 --> 19:30.363
JUST TO STOP ME.

19:30.364 --> 19:31.798
OH, YEAH?

19:31.799 --> 19:34.805
TURTLES DON'T
KNOW HOW TO BLUFF.

19:34.806 --> 19:37.509
WINDUP,
AND THE PITCH!

19:37.510 --> 19:39.647
NO!

19:39.648 --> 19:42.952
RIGHT OVER THE PLATE.
STRIKE ONE!

19:42.953 --> 19:44.890
GIVE ME THAT CRYSTAL.

19:44.891 --> 19:46.192
STRIKE TWO!

19:48.864 --> 19:50.365
STOP, YOU FOOLS.

19:50.366 --> 19:52.170
ALL THIS TOSSING
IS DESTABILIZING

19:52.171 --> 19:54.507
THE CRYSTAL'S ATOMIC
STRUCTURE.

19:56.478 --> 19:57.445
REALLY?

19:57.446 --> 20:00.718
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

20:03.223 --> 20:06.730
STRIKE THREE!
YOU'RE OUT.

20:06.731 --> 20:09.800
I JUST REMEMBERED,
YOU ONLY GET
THREE STRIKES.

20:11.872 --> 20:13.207
COME ON! LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE

20:13.208 --> 20:15.043
BEFORE
THE CRYSTAL BLOWS!

20:15.044 --> 20:16.680
AT LEAST I GOT AWAY.

20:16.681 --> 20:19.151
LET THOSE TURTLES DEAL
WITH THE CRYSTAL.

20:28.302 --> 20:31.441
GOSH, I WONDER WHAT THAT
EXPLOSION DID DO TO SHREDDER?

20:31.442 --> 20:33.310
NOTHING GOOD,
I HOPE.

20:40.892 --> 20:45.399
I SEE YOU CAME BACK
WITH THE TRILITHIUM CRYSTAL.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.370
THE POWER'S BACK ON.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.739
BUT HOW?

20:48.740 --> 20:50.241
HI, BOSS.

20:50.242 --> 20:52.912
I TOLD YOU TO GET
THEM BRAKES FIXED.

20:52.913 --> 20:56.486
FOR ONCE MY MUTANTS
DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

20:56.487 --> 20:58.021
YEAH, BOSS.

20:58.022 --> 21:01.161
WE BROUGHT BACK
THEM POWER PACKS.

21:01.162 --> 21:04.701
YEAH, WE GOT
FULL POWER NOW.

21:04.702 --> 21:07.271
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.

21:07.272 --> 21:09.943
PREPARE TO START
MAIN THRUSTERS.

21:14.018 --> 21:17.023
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
KRANG AND SHREDDER
LOST ANOTHER CHANCE

21:17.024 --> 21:18.926
TO POWER UP
THE TECHNODROME.

21:18.927 --> 21:20.830
YEAH, IF THOSE ZIPHEADS

21:20.831 --> 21:22.332
EVER GET THAT THING
RUNNING AGAIN,

21:22.333 --> 21:24.237
I'LL EAT
THIS COMIC BOOK.

21:24.238 --> 21:27.842
WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM
FOR A SPECIAL BULLETIN.

21:27.843 --> 21:30.381
TWO MUTANTS HAVE STOLEN
MISSILE POWER UNITS

21:30.382 --> 21:32.450
FROM THE MALYK
MISSILE PLANT.

21:32.451 --> 21:33.920
OH, NO.

21:33.921 --> 21:35.923
THEY DID IT AGAIN.

21:35.924 --> 21:38.061
MICHELANGELO,
STAY RIGHT THERE.
