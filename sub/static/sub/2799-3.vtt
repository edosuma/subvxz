WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:05.547
911.
What is your emergency?

00:05.547 --> 00:06.548
Th-There's been an accident.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.050
What kind of emergency?

00:08.550 --> 00:09.551
Please, I... I need you
to send an ambulance!

00:09.593 --> 00:11.053
You've gotta hurry! Please!

00:11.053 --> 00:13.055
Sir... calm down, sir.
Paramedics are on their way.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.598
Oh, my God! Please!
Please, you gotta help me!

00:14.640 --> 00:16.058
Please, hurry!
Sir, where are you injured?

00:16.099 --> 00:17.059
What? No, not me, my wife!

00:17.100 --> 00:18.060
Hurry! She's in here!

00:19.561 --> 00:21.063
Get out of
the way, sir.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.567
De-fib.
Yeah.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.818
What does that mean?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.070
Sir, please
stand back.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.613
Go ahead.
Okay.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.073
Hold on. Hold on.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.577
All right.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.579
No response.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.087
Uh, it's an emergency call-out;

00:45.128 --> 00:46.088
the paramedics responded.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.089
They found

00:47.089 --> 00:49.091
Mrs. Lester
on the back stairs.

00:49.091 --> 00:53.095
They pronounced at, uh...
12:16 a. m.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.599
And, of course, you walked
through the house.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.101
We were responding
to a traumatic injury.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.103
Our priority was
to assist the victim.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.615 --> 01:16.618
That's Ray Lester,
the vic's husband.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.621
Was he injured?

01:19.621 --> 01:24.126
No, uh, that's
his wife's blood.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.628
He said he checked to
see if she was still alive

01:26.670 --> 01:29.631
and he held her until
the paramedics came.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.633
Wouldn't you?

01:31.633 --> 01:34.136
You never met my ex.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.148
Tequila will always remind me
of Senor Frog's.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.649
Which one?

01:47.649 --> 01:51.153
Cancun.
My honeymoon.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.654
My dime.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.157
Well, if you ever want
to go back, it's on me.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.659
Is that a proposal?

02:05.167 --> 02:07.920
It's like
the Red Sea in here.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.672
The Red Sea's not red, David.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.675
No, it's blue from afar and
transparent when held in hand,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.469
like any other
body of water.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.179
I was just speaking
figuratively.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.180
I'm assuming

02:18.180 --> 02:20.682
those boot prints aren't yours.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.185
Please, I was just waiting
for you guys to clear a path.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.187
Blame the paramedics.

02:25.187 --> 02:28.690
This girl's head and spine
are perfectly aligned.

02:28.732 --> 02:29.691
Yeah, when you fall down

02:29.691 --> 02:31.693
the stairs, your head tends
to go in one direction,

02:31.735 --> 02:33.195
your body in another.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.196
I'll take a statement
from the husband

02:34.696 --> 02:36.198
and the paramedics;
see if she was moved.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.699
You know, twice
as many people

02:37.699 --> 02:39.701
die each year
from falling down stairs

02:39.743 --> 02:41.203
than from accidental gunfire?

02:41.245 --> 02:42.704
You didn't just get back

02:42.704 --> 02:44.206
from one of those coroner's
conferences, did you?

02:48.210 --> 02:49.211
What are you thinking?

02:49.253 --> 02:51.213
Led Zeppelin.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.217
"Stairway To Heaven. "

03:04.726 --> 03:07.729
? Who are you??

03:07.729 --> 03:11.233
? Who, who, who, who??

03:11.275 --> 03:12.734
? Who are you??

03:12.734 --> 03:14.987
? Who, who, who, who?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.656
? I really wanna know?

03:17.698 --> 03:20.242
? Who... are you??

03:20.284 --> 03:22.244
? Oh-oh-oh!?

03:22.244 --> 03:25.747
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

03:25.789 --> 03:28.750
? Oh, you!?

03:51.773 --> 03:52.774
Hey, Sanders.

03:52.816 --> 03:53.734
Hey.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.735
Back stairs.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.779
And, uh, you might
want to hug the wall.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.243
Whew!

04:03.285 --> 04:04.786
Did you ever hear
of Odor Eaters?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.749
Never mind.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.792
We don't get another boot
allowance till spring.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.294
Well, I'll try
to get 'em back to you

04:12.336 --> 04:13.754
before your next shift, okay?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.756
Uh, one more question:
Did either

04:15.797 --> 04:17.298
of you guys move the
body? Didn't have to.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.301
She was faceup.
I unbuttoned her blouse

04:19.343 --> 04:20.594
to apply the leads,
but that's it.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.762
We tried not to touch anything.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.806
Once we saw that blood,
we knew you'd be showing up.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.768
Becky Lester.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.312
Catherine and I got here
a half an hour after

04:30.354 --> 04:32.606
her husband called 911.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.816
Edges of the blood pools

04:34.858 --> 04:35.776
were already dry.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.278
The pools themselves were tacky.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.822
Which means she'd been down here
at least an hour or two

04:40.864 --> 04:42.282
before you guys even got here.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.826
Why did the husband wait so long
to call?

04:44.868 --> 04:45.786
Good question.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.287
Coroner won't touch the body

04:47.329 --> 04:49.331
till Catherine and I are done
processing around it,

04:49.373 --> 04:51.333
so, Sara, would you please
go up the front stairs

04:51.834 --> 04:52.835
and work your way down
the back stairs?

04:52.876 --> 04:53.836
You got it.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.295
Warrick, could you

04:55.337 --> 04:56.839
process the blood evidence
from the front door

04:56.880 --> 04:58.090
to the back stairwell?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.299
And if you'll notice,

04:59.341 --> 05:01.301
she doesn't have any blood
on her feet.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.846
So I can assume those bloody
footprints aren't hers.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.348
Nick, Brass is in the study
with the husband

05:06.390 --> 05:07.850
and he's waiting for you.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.886
Hey, Grissom,

06:25.928 --> 06:28.931
spatter on the wall
doesn't exceed 18 inches.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.433
Well, that's consistent
with a fall.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.400
Guys,

06:40.442 --> 06:41.902
if she fell,

06:41.944 --> 06:44.404
even if she was pushed down
these stairs,

06:44.446 --> 06:47.449
I would expect to find
smudge marks on these walls.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.408
Yeah, she would've

06:48.450 --> 06:49.952
instinctively reached out
for leverage.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.411
There are none.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.956
Not to mention,
that if she was up here

06:53.997 --> 06:56.458
before she was down there...

06:57.459 --> 06:59.461
...she should've landed
headfirst.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.467
The body position is
inconsistent with a fall.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.470
Well, it's inconsistent
if she felldownthe stairs.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.974
Maybe she fell up.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.442
Catherine,

07:22.484 --> 07:23.986
can I borrow your micrometer?

07:28.991 --> 07:32.995
Blood spatter measures
two millimeters.

07:33.036 --> 07:33.954
Medium spatter.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.999
Suggests impact
with a blunt object.

07:40.002 --> 07:43.505
But if she was hit,
where's the castoff?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.468
It is a low ceiling.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.970
Pretty hard to swing a weapon.

07:50.012 --> 07:53.515
Sometimes first blush
gives you a head rush.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.477
I don't think
I moved her, um...

07:57.519 --> 08:00.522
I mean, I cradled
her head in my lap.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.483
Tried to wake her up,
but that's it.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.527
So, you and your wife went
to Piero's for dinner,

08:05.569 --> 08:06.778
got home around 10:00,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.030
got out the tequila,

08:08.071 --> 08:09.489
and then what?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.491
I, you know, got comfortable...

08:11.533 --> 08:14.536
then we went outside
and did a few shots.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.996
How'd the tequila
get back inside?

08:16.038 --> 08:19.041
Um, the phone rang
and it was my daughter Susan.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.501
Your daughter?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.503
Yeah, from my first marriage.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.047
She's, she's staying
at Becky's dad's.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.507
All right.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.050
It's Susan.
Oh.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.302
Hey, babe.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.471
Uh-huh.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.515
Okay.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.557
It's boy trouble.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.559
I'll take this inside.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.022
What did you do after that?

08:42.063 --> 08:46.568
Another shot or two and
then I guess I fell asleep.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.570
And I woke up
around midnight.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.531
And I figured that

08:50.572 --> 08:52.574
she and Susan had just gotten
into one of their talk-a-thons.

08:53.575 --> 08:57.079
I took the tequila and
the glasses into the kitchen

08:57.120 --> 08:58.080
and that's when I saw her.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.581
Oh, my God.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.585
Oh, oh, please!
Oh, please!

09:03.627 --> 09:05.337
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

09:05.379 --> 09:07.089
Please! Oh, please!

09:13.095 --> 09:15.597
Now, is there any reason
that you can think of

09:15.639 --> 09:17.850
why your wife would be using
the back stairs?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.018
From the kitchen, it's
closer to the bedroom.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.104
You never mentioned anything
about the bedroom.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.106
Are you trying
to trip me up or something?

09:24.147 --> 09:25.566
I mean, I don't...

09:25.607 --> 09:27.067
maybe she went to,
uh, brush her teeth

09:27.109 --> 09:28.569
or put on her nightgown.
I really don't know.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.612
Okay, sir. I'm going to need
to take your clothing.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.075
I'll go upstairs and change.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.619
No, that's okay.
We're still processing upstairs.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.121
You can remove them
right here

09:39.162 --> 09:40.581
and I'll give you
a jumpsuit.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.624
I'll close my eyes,
if you're shy.

09:53.135 --> 09:56.138
Those don't look
like mosquito bites.

09:57.639 --> 10:01.643
My wife likes to bite,
and I don't mind it, okay?

10:01.685 --> 10:03.645
Okay.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.116
Okay,

10:16.158 --> 10:19.161
the husband says he
fell asleep, he woke up

10:19.203 --> 10:20.913
his wife was dead.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.623
He's a good sleeper.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.666
Yeah, I'm sure he's gonna say
something like that.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.667
Anyway, there's a daughter.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.127
She spent the night

10:27.169 --> 10:28.670
at her grandfather's,
who lives a few blocks away.

10:28.712 --> 10:29.671
I'm gonna check it out.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.673
I'm ready.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.429
The blue markers denote
the footprints.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.182
They're all consistent
with the husband.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.695
The footprints are associated
with gravitational blood drops.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.197
Please! Please!

11:00.702 --> 11:03.705
The yellow markers denote
the paramedics' boot prints.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.708
I'll call it.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.216
And what about this
here, on the counter?

11:14.258 --> 11:15.217
It's a single
blood drop.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.176
I'm thinking
it's from when

11:16.218 --> 11:18.220
the husband reached
for the phone.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.975
That's a good observation.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.726
What do you got in the bag?

11:24.768 --> 11:29.189
This...

11:29.231 --> 11:31.233
is a bloody paper towel
that I found in the trash.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.193
It's too textured to print,

11:33.235 --> 11:34.736
but Sanders talked
to the paramedics,

11:35.237 --> 11:36.238
who confirmed
that it wasn't theirs.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.197
I'm thinking
it was from the husband,

11:37.239 --> 11:39.741
when he tried to clean up
and saw it wouldn't be too easy.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.243
Lucky for us.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.794
Hey.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.757
Husband slept in the other room.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.800
His reading glasses are
on the nightstand.

12:38.842 --> 12:39.801
His clothing's in the dresser.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.762
That's odd.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.806
A man and a woman, who
don't share a bedroom,

12:44.848 --> 12:47.768
arrange to have a night alone,

12:47.809 --> 12:49.269
send their daughter
to a relative,

12:49.311 --> 12:53.315
go out to dinner,
have drinks by the pool,

12:53.357 --> 12:55.275
but they sleep
in separate bedrooms.

12:55.317 --> 13:01.323
Maybe... one of them snored
or had insomnia

13:01.365 --> 13:03.784
or liked to work at night.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.328
Or maybe they were suffocating
each other

13:06.370 --> 13:07.830
and he couldn't breathe.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.298
Sexual lubricant.

13:18.340 --> 13:22.302
It's half empty. Sticky.

13:22.344 --> 13:26.348
You know, you don't have to
sleep in the same bed together

13:26.390 --> 13:27.349
to have sex

13:27.391 --> 13:29.309
or...

13:29.351 --> 13:30.853
have romance.

13:33.355 --> 13:36.358
I'm going to go see the doctor.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.362
I'll grid the house.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.329
I don't understand.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.875
Becky was in perfect health.

13:52.916 --> 13:53.834
Can I see her?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.335
I'd like to see my daughter.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.837
Well, her body's with
the coroner, sir.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.882
There'll be an autopsy,
as part of our investigation.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.342
But you said she fell.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.846
Yeah, if, um...
if you don't mind,

14:05.888 --> 14:08.390
I'd like to ask you both
a few questions.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.392
Anything.
When was the last time

14:10.434 --> 14:11.894
either of you saw her?

14:11.935 --> 14:13.395
When she dropped Susan off

14:13.437 --> 14:14.354
yesterday evening,

14:14.396 --> 14:16.356
she came in for
a few minutes.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.401
Said she was headed home
and out to dinner with Ray.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.403
And that's the last time
you spoke with her.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.405
Yeah.
No.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.867
I called her.

14:26.909 --> 14:30.412
A little after 10:00,
after Grandpa went to bed.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.413
What did you talk about?

14:31.455 --> 14:32.414
Why is that important?

14:32.456 --> 14:33.874
Well...

14:33.916 --> 14:36.877
Stupid stuff.

14:36.919 --> 14:41.423
My best friend Jamila
and I, we both like Leon.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.884
And I know,
friendship first.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.929
I just wanted Becky to say it,
you know?

14:46.970 --> 14:49.389
Uh, yeah, okay.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.892
Thank you.
Thank you, Susan.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.436
Susan, would you give me
a moment with the detective?

14:54.478 --> 14:56.939
Okay.

14:59.441 --> 15:03.445
You said you found my daughter's
body on the stairwell?

15:03.487 --> 15:05.906
That's right.

15:05.948 --> 15:09.451
You're aware that Ray's
first wife, Susan's mother,

15:09.493 --> 15:11.453
was found the same way?

15:11.495 --> 15:13.413
Well, now I am.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.959
They said Susan's mom died
of a stroke.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.918
But you don't think so?

15:17.960 --> 15:20.420
I never had any reason
to doubt it.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.965
So how would you, uh,
how would you characterize

15:23.006 --> 15:24.466
your daughter's marriage?

15:24.508 --> 15:26.426
Ups and downs.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.470
About a year ago, Ray's business
went under.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.430
And Becky works

15:30.472 --> 15:31.932
for Western Airlines.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.475
They've been downsizing
since 9/11.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.476
It's been rough.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.436
Yeah.

15:36.478 --> 15:40.983
Mr. Stein, does your son-in-law
have a temper?

15:41.024 --> 15:42.484
Do I have to answer that?

15:42.526 --> 15:44.444
You just did.

15:44.486 --> 15:49.950
Becky Lester, 32.
Final meal, pasta.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.494
I can't tell you the variety
of the noodle,

15:52.536 --> 15:55.247
but there was a white sauce
with clams.

15:55.289 --> 15:57.916
And I found some blood
in her stomach.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.460
Her tongue was lacerated
perimortem.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.005
She probably chomped down on it
when she hit the stairs.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.965
I sent a blood sample to tox

16:05.007 --> 16:06.508
and Nick asked for
teeth impressions.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.510
Husband claims she's a biter.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.262
Fine line between

16:10.304 --> 16:11.972
pleasure and pain.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.517
But who doesn't like to cross it
every once in a while, right?

16:15.559 --> 16:18.020
Anyway, um, I don't know

16:18.061 --> 16:19.479
if it's probative,

16:19.521 --> 16:22.024
but there's semen
in her vaginal vault.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.526
Sperm motility and
positive acid phosphates

16:24.568 --> 16:26.278
suggest intercourse
approximately

16:26.320 --> 16:27.988
six to 12 hours
prior to death.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.532
Yeah, I'm mostly interested
in cause.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.993
Exsanguination from
five lacerations:

16:33.035 --> 16:35.537
Two to the forehead,
one to the right temple,

16:35.579 --> 16:36.788
and two to the occipital bone.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.998
Are they consistent
with a fall?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.542
Yes, but I'd expect to see
hand fractures as a result

16:40.584 --> 16:42.002
of the impact,
and there are none.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.046
Are they consistent with
blunt force trauma?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.048
Sure, but if the husband
bludgeoned her,

16:46.089 --> 16:47.549
there'd be fractures
to the skull.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.551
And there are none.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.512
None.
Well...

16:51.553 --> 16:54.056
you've given me
a lot of information, Doc,

16:54.097 --> 16:56.558
and none of it very helpful.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.573
You want fries with that?

17:15.577 --> 17:17.829
Robbins said the vic
bit her tongue.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.082
Theoretically,
she could've expirated

17:20.123 --> 17:21.040
the blood on the wall,

17:21.083 --> 17:23.085
providing an alternative
explanation

17:23.126 --> 17:24.586
for the medium velocity spatter.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.839
Do me a favor,

17:26.839 --> 17:28.089
check it out.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.100
Well, it looks like
two millimeters.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.353
Same as the blood at the scene.

17:41.395 --> 17:44.606
So, maybe itwas
just an accident.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.568
Tried to get up,

17:47.609 --> 17:50.612
she expirated the blood
on the wall.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.615
She failed
to regain her footing,

17:53.657 --> 17:55.576
impacting her temple,

17:55.617 --> 17:58.078
and then she bounced
on her occipital bone.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.124
So we've got two theories, both
supported by physical evidence.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.376
Yeah, if we ever find a murder
weapon, my theory's done.

18:04.418 --> 18:06.628
Well, I know that there was
no blood found in the car,

18:07.129 --> 18:08.589
so it's unlikely that Ray

18:08.630 --> 18:10.632
took a drive to dispose
of the weapon.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.594
Hey, ready for a quiz?

18:13.635 --> 18:15.596
Guess how Ray's first wife died?

18:15.637 --> 18:18.640
Wait. She had a stroke
on a stairway.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.101
Robbins told me.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.103
Is that the autopsy
report?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.647
No, these are medical records.
There was no autopsy.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.149
Jackie Lester had
a heart condition.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.609
Three weeks
before she died,

18:28.650 --> 18:30.152
she was admitted
to the hospital with vertigo.

18:30.194 --> 18:32.154
She ignored the doctor's
warnings,

18:32.196 --> 18:33.614
didn't take her medication.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.908
Family physician pronounced it
a stroke.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.118
Well, if she wasn't cremated,

18:38.160 --> 18:41.121
it's not too late for
a postmortem examination.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.165
Judge Witherspoon is issuing
a court order for exhumation.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.125
Now, look,
I just came from the DA.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.419
I gotta tell you,
he's already made up his mind.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.671
Husband and wife, home alone,
all that blood,

18:49.671 --> 18:51.131
shaky alibi.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.175
Plus, he says,
"He just looks guilty. "

18:53.217 --> 18:55.636
How does one "look" guilty?

18:55.677 --> 18:58.180
You know,
I'm just a messenger.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.139
What do you think

18:59.181 --> 19:00.682
the chances are
he didn't do it?

19:00.682 --> 19:01.683
Well, what do
you think

19:01.683 --> 19:02.643
the chances are

19:02.684 --> 19:03.685
we're going to give you
an answer

19:03.685 --> 19:04.686
before all the evidence is in?

19:04.686 --> 19:06.647
Greg...

19:06.688 --> 19:09.191
Becky Lester had a BAL
of point one-eight.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.693
And I found trace
amounts of Diazepam.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.653
Thanks!

19:12.694 --> 19:14.196
Hey, I heard the
coroner found semen,

19:14.238 --> 19:16.156
so I tested for
birth control.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.950
Estrogen and progesterone
levels were spiked.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.701
Where did you hear about
the coroner's findings?

19:19.701 --> 19:21.161
Actually, I read
the report.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.705
Maybe I don't want to be a
toxicologist my whole life.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.666
I mean, you went from
DNA to the field,

19:25.707 --> 19:27.709
and I guess you're kind
of a role model to me.

19:27.709 --> 19:28.669
A role model, huh?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.213
Yeah. By the way, where
do you get your hair cut?

20:14.256 --> 20:16.758
Quick. How many teeth
in the human mouth?

20:17.259 --> 20:19.219
Without wisdoms? 28.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.264
Yep, and the 28 teeth
in Becky's mouth

20:22.306 --> 20:23.265
do not match
the bite impressions

20:23.307 --> 20:24.766
on her husband's body.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.268
I guess Ray found himself

20:26.310 --> 20:27.769
another set of pearly whites.

20:27.769 --> 20:31.732
Look, I loved my wife.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.735
But, a year into our marriage,

20:34.776 --> 20:37.779
she told me that
she wasn't into sex anymore.

20:37.779 --> 20:41.241
And, uh, she went frigid on me.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.785
Asked me to move
into the other bedroom.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.747
And you were okay with that?

20:46.788 --> 20:50.542
Well, I kept hoping things
would get better.

20:50.584 --> 20:54.296
I mean, we had fun and
we respected each other.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.256
And she was a
great mom to Susan.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.051
I'm still confused
about the bite marks.

20:59.051 --> 21:01.803
I found a way to make
our relationship work.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.805
You found yourself a vampire?

21:03.805 --> 21:06.266
I met a girl on-line.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.768
She liked biting.
I liked being bit.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.812
It just seemed like a good
match, and it never got sexual.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.273
Uh-huh.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.317
And, uh, what is her name?

21:15.817 --> 21:22.282
I know her as
Buffy227@gmail. com.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.577
And your wife
never suspected anything?

21:25.619 --> 21:28.789
We'd meet at a motel...
every few weeks.

21:28.831 --> 21:30.833
I'd tell Becky
that I was going out for a bite.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.086
It was consensual

21:34.086 --> 21:35.963
and it wasn't sexual.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.798
It was not cheating.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.300
But you never told your wife?

21:40.342 --> 21:43.345
I didn't tell Becky everything
I did every minute of the day,

21:43.387 --> 21:45.347
but that doesn't mean
that I was unfaithful.

21:45.389 --> 21:46.807
When, exactly, was the last time

21:46.849 --> 21:49.852
that you had sexual intercourse
with your late wife?

21:49.852 --> 21:50.853
Four years ago.

21:53.355 --> 21:56.358
Rosy Palm and Thumbelina are
the only action that I get.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.321
Uh, wow, you know, uh,
a joke like that

22:01.363 --> 22:04.366
doesn't quite seem appropriate
for a distraught husband.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.868
I'm just answering
the questions.

22:07.369 --> 22:13.375
Mr. Lester, did you know that
your wife was having an affair?

22:17.379 --> 22:19.882
The day that she died,
she had had intercourse.

22:23.886 --> 22:25.387
Are we done here?

22:25.429 --> 22:27.389
For now.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.147
Ow... ooh.

22:35.147 --> 22:37.900
She's hot.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.903
But I still wouldn't
let her fang me.

22:40.903 --> 22:43.906
No, no, I'm...
I'm with you.

22:43.906 --> 22:45.908
Was the video encrypted?

22:45.908 --> 22:47.409
Uh, no.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.369
I was processing
Ray's computer

22:49.411 --> 22:51.413
and it was just sitting
on the desktop...

22:51.455 --> 22:53.415
in a folder called
"Dental Records. "

22:53.457 --> 22:55.375
Did you get an I.D.
on Buffy?

22:55.417 --> 22:57.419
Grissom got us
an administrative subpoena.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.421
ISP sent over
the subscriber information:

22:59.463 --> 23:03.926
Dr. Jeri Cohen-
aka Buffy227-

23:03.926 --> 23:05.385
is a dentist.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.387
Are you kidding me?

23:07.429 --> 23:09.431
I could not make this stuff up.

23:10.933 --> 23:13.185
I'm not ashamed
of my predilection.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.437
Assuming both parties
are healthy,

23:15.479 --> 23:17.940
biting can be orgasmic.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.399
Huh.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.944
Dr. Cohen, where
were you last night?

23:21.944 --> 23:23.946
Home alone, like most nights.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.697
Ma'am, we're here
to talk about

23:25.739 --> 23:27.407
your relationship
with Ray Lester.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.451
Well, I wouldn't call it
a relationship, per se.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.411
There was no sex, no commitment.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.456
We'd meet at a motel room,
once or twice a month.

23:34.498 --> 23:36.959
You e-mailed Ray
digital video

23:36.959 --> 23:38.919
of your sessions together.

23:38.961 --> 23:44.466
Ray bought me that camera
for, uh, my birthday.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.467
It was fun.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.471
If you say so.

23:49.972 --> 23:50.931
TheKama Sutrasays

23:50.973 --> 23:53.976
that any place on the body
that can be kissed

23:53.976 --> 23:55.978
can also be bitten.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.938
Except the upper lip,

23:57.980 --> 24:00.983
the interior of the mouth,
and, of course, the eye.

24:00.983 --> 24:02.442
It also goes on to describe

24:02.484 --> 24:05.487
eight different ways
to bite your partner.

24:05.529 --> 24:07.990
Ray liked "the broken cloud. "

24:07.990 --> 24:09.950
Teeth...

24:09.992 --> 24:12.452
are sexual organs.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.997
Um, Dr. Cohen, did, uh...

24:14.997 --> 24:17.457
did, uh...
Ray.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.501
...Ray ever mention his wife?

24:20.002 --> 24:21.503
He told me he was married.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.963
It wasn't a problem for me.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.464
He said they made
better friends

24:24.506 --> 24:26.508
than lovers and she was a good
mother, and that's about it.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.969
Was he violent?
Ray?

24:29.011 --> 24:31.513
No, he was nothing like that.

24:36.018 --> 24:36.977
See?

24:37.019 --> 24:38.520
No bite marks.

24:39.021 --> 24:40.480
I'm the aggressor.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.025
Ray just lies there
and takes it.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.027
He's a real sweetheart.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.031
Uh, ma'am...

24:53.535 --> 24:56.038
Would you mind
biting down on this for me?

24:56.038 --> 24:58.540
You know I wouldn't.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.045
They don't tell you about
this part of the job

25:03.045 --> 25:05.047
when you're training
to become a CSI.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.548
Come on, after
five years,

25:07.049 --> 25:08.800
at least they don't
smell anymore.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.552
Always with
the silver lining.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.054
Right.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.555
You ready?

25:16.058 --> 25:18.060
Well, hello, Jackie Lester.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.562
On three.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.026
One... two...

25:26.068 --> 25:28.570
three.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.078
If you two don't mind...

25:38.080 --> 25:40.082
...we'd like some alone time.

25:58.016 --> 26:04.523
? I been watchin'
your world from afar?

26:04.565 --> 26:11.029
? I been tryin'
to be where you are?

26:11.071 --> 26:17.536
? And I've been
secretly falling apart?

26:17.578 --> 26:20.038
? It seems...?

26:24.042 --> 26:26.503
?... To me?

26:26.545 --> 26:30.549
? You're strange
and you're beautiful?

26:30.591 --> 26:34.803
? You'd be so perfect with me?

26:34.845 --> 26:39.016
? But you just can't see?

26:39.057 --> 26:45.564
? You turn every head,
but you don't feel...?

26:46.565 --> 26:48.567
You done with your
alone time, Doc?

26:49.067 --> 26:51.570
Just completed my prelim,
but check this out.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.822
Subgaleal hemorrhages,
consistent with

26:53.864 --> 26:56.033
lacerations
to the occipital bone.

26:56.074 --> 26:59.578
So both of Ray's wives end up
dead at the bottom of the stairs

26:59.620 --> 27:01.038
with lacerations to the head.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.081
If my full autopsy
confirms murder,

27:03.123 --> 27:05.083
you maybe looking
at the first

27:05.125 --> 27:06.543
serial stairway killer.

27:06.585 --> 27:08.086
If there was
a murder weapon,

27:08.128 --> 27:09.338
it was not in that house.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.589
We searched everywhere.

27:10.631 --> 27:11.548
What's in the bag?

27:11.590 --> 27:13.050
Sex lube, found
at the crime scene.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.594
Autopsy revealed that Becky
was sexually active.

27:15.636 --> 27:17.095
Ray claims that they've
both been celibate

27:17.137 --> 27:18.555
for the past four years.

27:18.597 --> 27:21.099
And you wanted to see
if her lover's prints

27:21.141 --> 27:22.559
were on that bottle.

27:22.601 --> 27:25.103
Two viable prints, both
in a light coat of lube.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.606
One was Becky's and the other
is an Adam Gilford.

27:27.648 --> 27:29.066
Work card is in the system.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.610
He's an executive
at Western Airlines.

27:31.652 --> 27:34.112
Lovers and coworkers.
That never works.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.073
If Ray did find out

27:36.114 --> 27:38.575
about the affair,
that's motive.

27:38.617 --> 27:41.078
Of course I knew Becky Lester.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.872
I'm her boss.
I'm the one who hired her.

27:43.914 --> 27:46.625
Hard to believe
that was six years ago.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.127
And it's such a tragedy.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.588
She was loved.

27:51.630 --> 27:53.632
By some more than others.

27:53.674 --> 27:55.592
Excuse me?

27:55.634 --> 27:57.636
Mr. Gilford, we know
that the two of you

27:57.678 --> 27:58.595
were sleeping together.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.890
Becky wasn't in love with Ray.

28:01.932 --> 28:05.102
They'd stopped
having sex.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.895
If they divorced,
she'd owe him alimony,

28:06.937 --> 28:08.647
and Becky didn't think
that was right.

28:08.689 --> 28:09.898
Becky told you that?

28:09.940 --> 28:11.108
She told me
everything.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.110
She and Ray were
living on vapors.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.112
They'd just taken
a second on the house.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.156
She also told me that Ray
was hiding money from her-

28:17.197 --> 28:20.159
the insurance payout
on his first wife.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.162
Look, if you suspect
she was murdered,

28:23.203 --> 28:25.164
I can tell you why Ray did it.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.624
We're listening.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.168
At Western Airlines,
VPs and above

28:29.668 --> 28:31.670
receive corporate
life insurance policies.

28:31.712 --> 28:33.172
Quarter mil payouts.

28:33.672 --> 28:36.175
Last week, a round of
pink slips went out.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.135
We both got hit.

28:38.177 --> 28:40.679
Two weeks, she would've
been out of here.

28:40.721 --> 28:43.182
And the insurance
policy, suspended.

28:43.223 --> 28:44.641
And Ray is the beneficiary.

28:44.683 --> 28:48.687
He killed her
just in time to make a killing.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.199
DA's planning
to file charges

29:00.699 --> 29:02.659
against Ray Lester-
tomorrow,

29:02.701 --> 29:05.204
after an ADA stops by
the Crime Lab

29:05.245 --> 29:06.705
for a full briefing.

29:06.747 --> 29:08.165
That's too soon.

29:08.207 --> 29:09.708
Tell me about the first wife.

29:10.209 --> 29:12.169
Preliminary investigations
suggests foul play,

29:12.211 --> 29:15.214
but we've got nothing definitive
until she's fully posted.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.673
And the physical
evidence

29:16.715 --> 29:19.718
in Becky Lester's death
is completely ambiguous.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.721
The DA figures he'll
make a headline while you find

29:22.763 --> 29:24.223
corroborating
evidence.

29:24.723 --> 29:25.724
You think he's guilty, right?

29:26.225 --> 29:28.477
I don't think that yet.

29:28.519 --> 29:30.687
Oh, um, am I
interrupting?

29:30.729 --> 29:33.190
No. Brass just called with a heads up.

29:33.232 --> 29:36.235
Since when does the DA's office
tell us when we're ready?

29:36.276 --> 29:37.694
When the case is high profile

29:37.736 --> 29:40.239
and the DA is feeling heat
from the sheriff.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.699
Look, you'll just walk him
through the evidence.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.244
You won't bias your reports
or skip anything ambiguous.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.245
It is what it is.

29:46.745 --> 29:48.747
If the DA wants to shoot
his wad too early,

29:48.789 --> 29:50.249
we can't stop him.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.251
Okay.

29:56.255 --> 29:58.507
Sarah and I may have
uncovered motive.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.759
In the last two weeks,
Ray filled out

30:00.801 --> 30:02.761
five loan applications.

30:02.803 --> 30:04.763
200 G's a pop.
All denied.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.723
With his wife dead,

30:06.765 --> 30:10.269
he is the beneficiary
of a $250,000 policy.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.228
Huh.

30:11.270 --> 30:14.273
I wonder what he
needed the money for.

30:14.314 --> 30:17.734
I was... being blackmailed.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.737
Um, someone found
out about Buffy.

30:20.779 --> 30:23.782
I... I got a letter
and a photo in the mail.

30:23.824 --> 30:27.286
They wanted
200 grand or...

30:27.327 --> 30:28.245
otherwise...

30:28.287 --> 30:30.247
Otherwise, they'd share

30:30.289 --> 30:33.292
your biting secret
with your wife.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.752
Yeah.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.046
Our marriage
was having enough problems.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.174
I mean, you're covered
in those bite marks.

30:40.215 --> 30:42.301
Didn't your wife ever ask
where they came from?

30:42.801 --> 30:45.554
She hadn't seen me naked
in a long time.

30:45.596 --> 30:48.307
I just...
I would've been humiliated

30:48.807 --> 30:50.309
if she found out about Buffy.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.311
She was a great mom.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.816
And she kept... she kept me sane
when my business went under.

30:57.858 --> 31:00.777
You still have
the blackmail note?

31:00.819 --> 31:03.280
Yeah. I couldn't risk
letting Becky find it.

31:03.322 --> 31:05.824
Soon as I opened that letter,
it went right into my briefcase.

31:05.866 --> 31:07.326
I've got the only key.

31:15.334 --> 31:18.337
"Send $200,000
to P.O. Box 4976,

31:18.378 --> 31:20.339
"Searchlight,
Nevada, 89431

31:20.839 --> 31:21.798
"within two weeks

31:21.840 --> 31:23.800
or I'll send photos
to your wife. "

31:23.842 --> 31:26.595
The P.O. box was through
a private company,

31:26.637 --> 31:29.348
paid for in cash
with a pseudonym: Abe Lincoln.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.850
Ninhydrin picked up
six distinct prints.

31:32.351 --> 31:33.852
Five were
matched to Ray.

31:33.894 --> 31:35.854
What about the sixth?

31:35.896 --> 31:38.357
Becky Lester.

31:38.398 --> 31:39.316
Hold on.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.360
Ray told Brass that
Becky never saw that note,

31:41.860 --> 31:42.861
which means
he was lying.

31:42.903 --> 31:44.321
If she read the note,

31:44.363 --> 31:46.865
then it's possible
that Ray freaked out,

31:46.907 --> 31:48.826
bludgeoned her to death.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.619
What if Ray's telling the truth?

31:50.661 --> 31:52.371
Well, Catherine,
if he was,

31:52.871 --> 31:54.832
her fingerprints
would not be on this note.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.376
Unless she touched the letter
before it was sent,

31:57.417 --> 31:59.127
which would make her the sender.

31:59.169 --> 32:00.838
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.382
Becky thought that Ray was
squirreling away money.

32:03.423 --> 32:05.884
Maybe this is her way
of getting her hands on it.

32:05.926 --> 32:07.845
She used his fetish against him?

32:07.886 --> 32:10.389
She blackmailed her own husband,
knowing that he would pay up,

32:10.430 --> 32:12.391
so she wouldn't
find out his secret.

32:12.432 --> 32:13.892
That's ingenious.

32:13.934 --> 32:15.352
And really sad.

32:15.394 --> 32:17.354
If it's true.

32:17.396 --> 32:20.399
Well, if Becky's saliva's
on that envelope,

32:20.440 --> 32:22.401
it's indisputable.

32:30.409 --> 32:31.410
This is a blood clot.

32:31.410 --> 32:32.911
Take a look.

32:35.414 --> 32:36.373
Huh.
The blood's continuous.

32:36.415 --> 32:37.875
Comes from deep within
the parenchyma.

32:37.916 --> 32:41.420
The first wife had a stroke
and it was fatal.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.921
What about
the scalp lacerations?

32:42.921 --> 32:43.881
Perimortum.

32:43.922 --> 32:45.174
So she must've hit her head

32:45.174 --> 32:46.383
on the stairs on the way down.

32:46.425 --> 32:49.428
Well, I can't tell you
about the second wife,

32:49.428 --> 32:51.430
but this was a natural.

33:04.443 --> 33:05.903
That's
the Western Airlines logo.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.446
Over the past few years,
corporations have begun

33:07.446 --> 33:08.947
embedding their insignia
into the stationery

33:08.947 --> 33:10.449
for security purposes.

33:11.450 --> 33:14.453
If Becky wrote the note,
she wrote it at work.

33:14.453 --> 33:15.913
This is Catherine.

33:15.954 --> 33:18.457
Oh, yeah. I'm on my way.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.960
For the record, I think
you're filing prematurely.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.421
As always,
I value your opinion.

33:24.463 --> 33:26.965
But I'm confident in our
decision to move forward.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.425
But, come on, Grissom,

33:28.467 --> 33:30.928
granted the first death
was a natural-

33:30.969 --> 33:33.472
but two dead women,
married to the same guy,

33:33.472 --> 33:34.431
found in a stairwell?

33:34.473 --> 33:36.475
Lightning doesn't strike
in the same place twice.

33:36.475 --> 33:38.435
Actually, it does.

33:38.477 --> 33:40.479
The Empire State
Building gets struck

33:40.479 --> 33:41.438
20 times a year.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.982
Let's just run the case.

33:43.982 --> 33:45.943
Sorry,

33:45.984 --> 33:47.444
I got held up.

33:47.486 --> 33:48.946
No, you're just in time.

33:48.987 --> 33:50.739
Ms. Willows,
would you bring

33:50.739 --> 33:52.491
Mr. Sinclair
up to speed?

33:53.992 --> 33:55.494
I'd be happy to.

33:55.494 --> 33:57.496
Ray and Becky Lester

33:57.538 --> 33:59.456
were unhappily married.

33:59.498 --> 34:03.502
She was having an affair
with her boss, he was indulging

34:03.502 --> 34:04.962
his biting fetish.

34:05.003 --> 34:06.964
They were having
financial problems.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.757
But Becky believed that Ray
was hiding money.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.511
Two weeks ago, Ray received
a blackmail note

34:12.511 --> 34:14.471
demanding 200 grand

34:14.513 --> 34:17.014
or the wife finds out
about Bite Girl.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.475
Well, we have just confirmed

34:18.516 --> 34:23.021
that the blackmailer and
the wife are one and the same.

34:23.021 --> 34:25.482
Based on what?

34:25.524 --> 34:27.025
The envelope
of the ransom note.

34:27.025 --> 34:28.485
DNA was a match.

34:28.527 --> 34:30.529
The wife was blackmailing
the husband?

34:32.030 --> 34:34.032
Never underestimate
the deviousness

34:34.032 --> 34:35.492
of a malcontented spouse.

34:35.534 --> 34:37.494
He found out and he killed her.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.038
We don't have any evidence
to support that.

34:40.038 --> 34:41.039
Run the timeline.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.043
Couple got home
around 10:00 p. m.

34:46.545 --> 34:48.045
They went outside
and had some tequila.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.505
At 10:08,
Ray's daughter

34:49.547 --> 34:51.800
from his first
marriage phoned.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.052
Becky went inside
to take the call.

34:54.052 --> 34:56.054
How long did they talk?

34:58.056 --> 35:00.017
It's not in Brass' notes.

35:00.058 --> 35:03.061
Well, I have the phone
records here, so...

35:03.061 --> 35:06.064
Uh, the call lasted...

35:06.064 --> 35:08.525
two minutes?!

35:08.567 --> 35:11.570
I thought the husband told Nick
it was a marathon call.

35:11.570 --> 35:15.324
Yeah, I'm just seeing this
for the first time here. Um...

35:15.365 --> 35:19.077
The incoming call did not come
from the grandfather's house.

35:19.077 --> 35:22.080
I'm gonna
call this number.

35:26.084 --> 35:28.337
You've reached the home office
of Ray Lester.

35:28.337 --> 35:30.589
Please leave your details
after the beep.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.593
Susan called her stepmother
from inside the house.

35:34.593 --> 35:37.095
Did anybody process
that office phone?

35:37.137 --> 35:40.349
The office was away
from the crime scene.

35:40.390 --> 35:43.602
We, uh, checked it
for a murder weapon,

35:43.602 --> 35:44.603
but that's about it.

35:46.605 --> 35:49.107
I'll get an investigator
over there.

35:50.609 --> 35:53.111
Unless you're in
too much of a hurry.

36:00.118 --> 36:02.120
There it is.

36:14.132 --> 36:15.592
Greg...

36:15.634 --> 36:18.637
there's a fingerprint in blood.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.600
Detective,

36:23.642 --> 36:25.102
what's going on?

36:25.143 --> 36:26.895
Mr. Stein,
where's Susan?

36:26.895 --> 36:28.605
Is everything okay
with Dad?

36:28.647 --> 36:30.148
We have a warrant
to search your house.

36:30.148 --> 36:32.109
A warrant?! What?

36:32.150 --> 36:34.653
Would you both please step
outside with this officer?

36:34.653 --> 36:36.155
Can I get my homework?

36:36.155 --> 36:38.157
Well, uh...

36:38.157 --> 36:40.117
Sure.

36:40.159 --> 36:41.660
That'd be all right.

36:41.660 --> 36:42.661
Okay.

36:52.171 --> 36:53.672
I'm gonna need to see
inside your backpack.

36:53.672 --> 36:55.632
It's just my books and stuff.

36:55.674 --> 36:57.676
I'd like to see
what you're studying.

37:23.202 --> 37:25.704
What did you hit her with?

37:35.214 --> 37:37.674
I want to talk to my dad.

37:37.716 --> 37:39.718
Why don't we take
a ride downtown?

37:39.718 --> 37:41.220
You can call him
from there.

37:43.722 --> 37:44.723
Nice work.

38:54.293 --> 38:56.753
My stepmom was a bitch.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.797
Susan, you're
not helping.

38:58.797 --> 39:00.257
Please, stay quiet.

39:00.299 --> 39:02.259
BRASS
Excuse me for a minute.

39:02.301 --> 39:03.802
You know, I guess
this could explain

39:03.802 --> 39:05.304
why Becky's skull
was lacerated

39:05.304 --> 39:06.763
and not fractured.

39:06.805 --> 39:08.557
She wasn't strong enough.

39:08.557 --> 39:10.267
I had to protect him.

39:10.309 --> 39:11.810
Protect who, Susan?
Susan!

39:11.810 --> 39:12.769
Protect your father?

39:12.811 --> 39:14.313
Protect your father from what?

39:14.313 --> 39:15.772
She was gonna leave him.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.817
So that's why you killed
your stepmother,

39:18.817 --> 39:20.277
to protect your father.

39:20.319 --> 39:24.323
Last week, I skipped soccer
practice and came home early.

39:27.826 --> 39:30.329
You are so damn
brilliant.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.332
I just found
the digital video

39:33.332 --> 39:35.083
and printed out
the stills.

39:35.125 --> 39:36.710
"Dental Records. "

39:36.752 --> 39:38.337
I married a moron.

39:43.842 --> 39:46.094
Did you check
the P.O. box today?

39:46.094 --> 39:48.347
Empty, but he's got
another week.

39:48.347 --> 39:50.307
Ray's whipped.

39:50.349 --> 39:51.850
He brought up
counseling again.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.310
The idiot would die

39:53.352 --> 39:55.854
before letting me in
on his freak-ass fetish.

40:00.359 --> 40:02.861
My dad only married Becky
because of me.

40:02.861 --> 40:04.822
Explain that to me.

40:04.863 --> 40:06.615
Well, he thought
I needed a mom

40:06.615 --> 40:08.992
and that's why
he stayed with her.

40:09.034 --> 40:11.328
Blaming herself
for the marriage.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.872
She doesn't seem to blame
herself for ending it.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.375
So you waited for your
granddad to go to sleep

40:16.375 --> 40:17.876
and you snuck out
of the house,

40:17.876 --> 40:19.336
snuck back into your house,

40:19.378 --> 40:22.381
then you called your stepmom
from your dad's telephone line.

40:22.381 --> 40:23.841
Pretty tricky.

40:23.882 --> 40:27.386
And then, you must've...

40:27.386 --> 40:29.388
hid somewhere.

40:31.390 --> 40:33.851
I hid in the closet.

40:33.892 --> 40:36.895
I told her we had to talk and
that I knew about her boyfriend.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.146
Uh, hey, Dad.

40:38.188 --> 40:39.356
Is Becky there?

40:39.398 --> 40:40.399
Could I talk to her?

40:40.399 --> 40:42.401
All right.

40:42.442 --> 40:44.403
It's Susan.

40:44.444 --> 40:46.363
Hey, babe.

40:46.405 --> 40:47.906
Just tell Dad
you'll take the call inside

40:47.906 --> 40:49.408
and meet me in my room.

40:49.408 --> 40:50.868
Okay.

40:50.909 --> 40:53.370
It's boy trouble.

40:53.412 --> 40:54.913
I'll take this inside.

41:10.429 --> 41:11.889
Are we done here?

41:11.930 --> 41:13.390
Almost.
We're almost done.

41:13.432 --> 41:15.434
You know, Susan,
there was a bloody paper towel

41:15.434 --> 41:16.393
left in the trash.

41:16.435 --> 41:18.437
Can you tell me about that?

41:19.938 --> 41:22.941
I went into the kitchen
and tried to clean up.

41:25.444 --> 41:27.946
Then I put the phone
back in my dad's office

41:27.946 --> 41:28.906
and I walked back
to Grandpa's.

41:28.947 --> 41:31.450
Where was your father
when you killed your stepmother?

41:32.451 --> 41:35.454
He was outside.

41:35.454 --> 41:37.456
Asleep.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.210
Did you catch that?

41:41.210 --> 41:43.462
Timeline is off.

41:43.462 --> 41:47.925
Curious.

41:47.966 --> 41:49.468
You want to talk
to the dad

41:49.468 --> 41:51.970
and I'll call the DA?

41:51.970 --> 41:52.971
Sure.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.986
You knew.

42:07.986 --> 42:09.947
What?

42:09.988 --> 42:12.991
Your daughter killed your wife
and you knew it.

42:12.991 --> 42:16.453
I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:16.495 --> 42:19.498
Susan attacked Becky as soon
as she went into the house.

42:19.498 --> 42:22.501
But you admitted
to having another drink.

42:22.501 --> 42:23.961
You would've heard the attack.

42:24.002 --> 42:26.505
I'm sorry, but
that's what happ...

42:26.505 --> 42:27.965
You went into the house

42:28.006 --> 42:31.510
and found Susan wiping blood
off of her hands.

42:31.510 --> 42:34.763
You sent her back
to her grandfather's.

42:34.805 --> 42:38.016
You came up with a story
to tell the cops,

42:38.016 --> 42:40.018
and then called 911.

42:42.020 --> 42:45.023
You were protecting
your daughter.

42:45.023 --> 42:46.525
And now she's protecting you.

42:49.528 --> 42:50.529
You can't prove it.

42:54.533 --> 42:59.037
Well, either way,
you have to live with it.
