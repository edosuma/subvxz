WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.233
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.233 --> 00:03.304
JACK, I'M SO SORRY.

00:03.304 --> 00:04.375
WHY ISN'T MY EX-HUSBAND
IN PRISON?

00:04.375 --> 00:06.037
WE HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

00:06.037 --> 00:08.138
OF A CONSPIRACY
TO FRAME DAVID CLARKE.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.111
SHE SAID YOU WERE
HIDING EVIDENCE

00:10.111 --> 00:11.182
THAT COULD DESTROY US ALL.

00:11.182 --> 00:12.313
YOU GO THROUGH
WITH DESTROYING DAD,

00:12.313 --> 00:14.045
AND YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

00:14.045 --> 00:15.246
CAN I STAY WITH YOU
TONIGHT?

00:15.246 --> 00:17.017
ARE ALL YOUR T-SHIRTS
DEEP V's?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.089
WOW. YOU WORK FAST.

00:18.089 --> 00:19.390
NO, CHARLOTTE,
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

00:22.353 --> 00:24.225
I'M GONNA TRACK
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN

00:24.225 --> 00:26.127
TO WHEREVER HE'S HIDING.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.028
WE HAVE GOT EYES
INSIDE HIS HOUSE.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.100
OHH!

00:29.100 --> 00:30.231
(grunts)
 SHH.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.333
THIS IS THE EVIDENCE
I WAS PLANNING ON TURNING OVER.

00:38.209 --> 00:41.342
(Emily) IN EVERY LIFE,
THERE COMES A DAY OF RECKONING,

00:41.342 --> 00:46.046
A TIME WHEN UNSETTLED SCORES
DEMAND THEIR RETRIBUTION...

00:46.046 --> 00:47.378
AND OUR OWN LIES
AND TRANSGRESSIONS

00:47.378 --> 00:50.081
ARE FINALLY LAID BARE.

00:50.081 --> 00:52.153
DANIEL!

00:52.153 --> 00:53.224
EMILY! YOU OKAY?

00:53.224 --> 00:55.286
THERE WAS A MAN
IN THE KITCHEN! HE...

00:55.286 --> 00:57.088
HE RUSHED RIGHT BY ME.
I WAS JUST GOING FOR A RUN.

00:57.088 --> 00:58.229
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:58.229 --> 00:59.360
YOU'RE SAFE. YOU'RE SAFE.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.262
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE GOT IN THROUGH HERE.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.393
(Emily) HE WAS HOLDING SOMETHING
WHEN HE LEFT,

01:02.393 --> 01:04.235
BUT I COULDN'T SEE
WHAT IT WAS.

01:04.235 --> 01:05.366
(pants)

01:10.101 --> 01:11.272
OH, GOD.

01:13.344 --> 01:16.107
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIM?

01:16.107 --> 01:17.408
HE WAS OLDER. HE--HE WAS
ALL DRESSED IN BLACK.

01:17.408 --> 01:19.210
SHOCK-WHITE HAIR.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.281
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.183
NO! NO.
NO MORE POLICE.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.415
IT WAS PROBABLY JUST
ONE OF MY TRIAL PROTESTERS

01:24.415 --> 01:26.086
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE ME.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.088
YEAH, WELL, IT WORKED.
WHAT DID HE TAKE?

01:28.088 --> 01:31.122
JUST SOME CLIENT FILES.
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

01:31.122 --> 01:33.194
(exhales) LOOK, MY DAD
HAS A SECURITY TEAM.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.266
I WANT
TO HANDLE THIS PRIVATELY.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.467
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE SHOULD PACK UP THE HOUSE,

01:36.467 --> 01:38.199
HEAD BACK TO MANHATTAN.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.400
OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.403
I'LL START PACKING BOXES.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.306
(exhales)

01:47.408 --> 01:50.481
(Daniel) EMILY SAID THE GUY HAD
WHITE HAIR AND PIERCING EYES.

01:50.481 --> 01:52.383
IT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?

01:52.383 --> 01:54.445
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

01:54.445 --> 01:57.318
AND IT'S NOT HIS FIRST TIME
IN EMILY'S HOUSE.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.320
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:59.320 --> 02:02.323
HE SENT ME THIS VIDEO
OF THE TWO OF YOU AS A THREAT.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.456
HE'S BEEN WATCHING US?

02:05.456 --> 02:08.258
I HANDLED IT WITH
A COUNTERTHREAT OF MY OWN.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.130
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED,

02:10.130 --> 02:12.433
TO FERRET OUT THE EVIDENCE
I HAD BEEN KEEPING.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.134
YOU DON'T THINK MOM
COULD'VE TOLD HIM?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.206
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

02:15.206 --> 02:17.168
(keypad beeps)
 (man) Security.

02:17.168 --> 02:21.141
ROBERT, I NEED A SECURITY SWEEP
OF GRAYSON MANOR, ASAP.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.314
(cell phone beeps)
 AT LEAST TELL ME THIS IS BETTER
THAN THE FEDS FINDING IT.

02:23.314 --> 02:26.377
BETTER THAN THE FEDS?

02:26.377 --> 02:29.420
DANIEL, THAT EVIDENCE WAS
THE ONLY LEVERAGE I HAD

02:29.420 --> 02:31.222
AGAINST THESE VAMPIRES.

02:31.222 --> 02:33.153
WITHOUT THAT...

02:33.153 --> 02:35.186
I'M A DEAD MAN.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.534
(whirs)

02:43.534 --> 02:45.196
(beeps)

02:45.196 --> 02:47.198
DAMN IT.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.202
(keypad beeps)

02:51.202 --> 02:52.443
Nolan.
Leave a message.

02:52.443 --> 02:56.207
NOLAN, TURN ON YOUR PHONE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

02:58.309 --> 02:59.380
(cell phone beeps)

02:59.380 --> 03:00.551
(sighs)

03:00.551 --> 03:03.314
(cash register bell dings)

03:12.323 --> 03:13.524
NOLAN.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.195
(cell phone rings)

03:15.195 --> 03:16.327
(ring)

03:16.327 --> 03:18.198
JACK.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.430
(ring)

03:19.430 --> 03:21.402
(beeps)

03:23.203 --> 03:24.475
This is Emily.
Leave a message.

03:24.475 --> 03:26.407
(voice mail beeps)
 HEY, IT'S JACK.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.279
UM, ABOUT LAST NIGHT...

03:28.279 --> 03:31.382
I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK, HUH?

03:31.382 --> 03:33.444
CALL ME WHEN YOU CAN.

03:33.444 --> 03:34.515
BYE.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.586
(beep)

03:41.252 --> 03:43.454
(creaks)

03:43.454 --> 03:45.396
NOLAN?

04:07.278 --> 04:09.520
(keypad beeps)

04:09.520 --> 04:11.522
(cell phone rings)

04:11.522 --> 04:13.253
(grunts)

04:13.253 --> 04:14.325
NOLAN.
 (grunt)

04:14.325 --> 04:15.456
(rings and beeps)

04:15.456 --> 04:17.387
Yes.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.329
HE'S NOT THE ONE
YOU WANT.

04:19.329 --> 04:20.560
I AM.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.463
And who are you?

04:22.463 --> 04:25.396
AMANDA CLARKE.

04:25.396 --> 04:28.268
YOU MURDERED MY FATHER.

04:30.641 --> 04:33.544
YOU AND I
HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

04:33.544 --> 04:35.646
Then by all means,
let's finish it.

04:35.646 --> 04:38.479
How would you like
to do this?

04:41.312 --> 04:45.656
FACE-TO-FACE.

04:45.656 --> 04:48.659
♪♪♪

04:56.627 --> 04:57.698
YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE

04:57.698 --> 04:58.829
TO EXCAVATE
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.

04:58.829 --> 05:00.831
THE HELL YOU DO.

05:00.831 --> 05:02.703
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE
IMMEDIATELY.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.775
DO I NEED TO CALL THE POLICE
TO HAVE YOU FORCIBLY REMOVED?

05:04.775 --> 05:06.777
NO, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN.

05:06.777 --> 05:07.878
OH.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.680
THANKS TO A LETHAL COMBINATION
OF YOUR VITRIOL

05:09.680 --> 05:10.811
AND YOUR INCOMPETENCE,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.713
THE EVIDENCE YOU STOLE FROM ME
IS NOW IN THE HANDS

05:12.713 --> 05:15.646
OF OUR
MOST POWERFUL ADVERSARY.

05:15.646 --> 05:16.847
WELL, IF THAT MONSTER
HAS INDEED RESURFACED,

05:16.847 --> 05:18.889
YOU HAVE YOUR SON TO BLAME,
NOT ME.

05:18.889 --> 05:21.892
OUR SON IS LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE THIS MORNING,

05:21.892 --> 05:23.824
NO THANKS TO YOU.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.627
WE FOUND THREE MICROPHONES
IN THE STUDY, SIR.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.829
I'M GUESSING
IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.562
YOU LET THEM IN,
VICTORIA.

05:31.562 --> 05:33.664
AND THEY'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO EVERY SINGLE WORD WE'VE SAID

05:33.664 --> 05:35.706
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.

05:35.706 --> 05:38.639
THE THING IS,
NOW WE ARE ALL TARGETS.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.641
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE
IT WAS WORTH

05:40.641 --> 05:43.614
WHATEVER PETTY LITTLE FRISSON
YOU DERIVED

05:43.614 --> 05:45.846
FROM YOUR DALLIANCE
WITH THE S.E.C.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.718
YOU STUPID,

05:47.718 --> 05:49.780
STUPID, WOMAN.

06:07.738 --> 06:09.600
(cell phone rings)

06:09.600 --> 06:10.741
(beeps)

06:10.741 --> 06:12.573
HEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:12.573 --> 06:14.605
LISTEN, I THINK WE SHOULD
HEAD BACK TO MANHATTAN TONIGHT.

06:14.605 --> 06:15.806
You okay saying a quick good-bye
to the Hamptons?

06:15.806 --> 06:17.648
YOU READ MY MIND.

06:17.648 --> 06:18.879
I'M ACTUALLY MEETING WITH
THE WINTERIZERS FOR THE COTTAGE

06:18.879 --> 06:20.851
RIGHT NOW.

06:20.851 --> 06:22.653
GOOD, GOOD.

06:22.653 --> 06:24.685
Ems, be careful.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.957
I WILL.

06:26.957 --> 06:28.889
(beep)

06:40.801 --> 06:41.932
(clicks)

06:45.936 --> 06:48.809
NO WIRE, NO PHONE, NO WEAPON.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.611
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.644
AND FOR WHAT...
PAYBACK FOR YOUR FATHER?

06:53.644 --> 06:54.845
I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION

06:54.845 --> 06:56.947
EVIDENCE COMPILED BY
CONRAD GRAYSON

06:56.947 --> 06:59.790
IMPLICATING YOU AND ALL OF
YOUR FRIENDS AT THE INITIATIVE

06:59.790 --> 07:01.952
IN A CONSPIRACY TO FUND
AND CARRY OUT ACTS OF TERRORISM

07:01.952 --> 07:03.894
ON AMERICAN SOIL.

07:03.894 --> 07:05.656
NOW...

07:05.656 --> 07:06.927
TAKE ME TO NOLAN ROSS.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.630
AS YOU WISH.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.009
IT'S CHLOROFORM.

07:19.009 --> 07:21.772
SURELY YOU APPRECIATE
THE NEED FOR SECRECY.

07:21.772 --> 07:22.843
AND IF I DON'T?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.715
YOUR FRIEND DIES.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.670
AMANDA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

07:50.871 --> 07:52.873
I FORGOT TO PACK
MOMMY'S PICTURE.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.705
(object clatters)

07:54.705 --> 07:56.046
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:56.046 --> 07:58.048
(chirping)

07:58.048 --> 08:01.752
(gasps) DADDY.

08:13.824 --> 08:14.965
(chains rattle)

08:14.965 --> 08:17.067
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.800
IF YOU CAME HERE
TO RESCUE ME...

08:19.800 --> 08:20.871
(door buzzes open)

08:20.871 --> 08:21.932
YOU MIGHT WANT
A DO-OVER.

08:21.932 --> 08:25.876
I TRUST YOU HAD
A PLEASANT NAP, MS. CLARKE.

08:28.979 --> 08:31.782
RATHER THAN WASTE MY TIME
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE,

08:31.782 --> 08:33.844
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY

08:33.844 --> 08:37.847
TO TELL ME WHERE YOU'VE HIDDEN
GRAYSON'S EVIDENCE.

08:38.989 --> 08:42.923
IN RETURN, I MAY EVEN
LET YOUR FRIEND HERE LIVE.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.757
ACTUALLY... (sighs)
HE DOESN'T CONCERN ME.

08:46.757 --> 08:50.731
GEE,
DON'T SUGARCOAT IT, EMS.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.002
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

08:52.002 --> 08:54.004
I TAKE BACK MY OFFER.
 (grunting)

08:54.004 --> 08:56.066
THE EVIDENCE
THAT YOU WANT

08:56.066 --> 08:57.738
IS IN LOCKER 428

08:57.738 --> 08:59.740
AT THE PORT AUTHORITY
BUS TERMINAL.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.072
THE ORANGE KEY FROM MY KEYCHAIN
WILL OPEN IT.

09:02.072 --> 09:03.814
IF THAT'S TRUE,

09:03.814 --> 09:05.846
WHAT'S TO STOP ME
FROM KILLING YOU RIGHT NOW?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.848
I COULD BE LYING.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.850
SHE'S REALLY QUITE GOOD
AT IT.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.882
OR I COULD'VE PROGRAMMED
AN E-MAIL

09:11.882 --> 09:13.884
TO ALERT THE AUTHORITIES.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.956
I WOULD TELL YOU
HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE LEFT,

09:15.956 --> 09:18.989
BUT YOU STOLE MY WATCH.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.891
(grunts)

09:23.964 --> 09:28.098
A SUBMARINER WITH A LOCK PICK
HIDDEN INSIDE.

09:30.901 --> 09:32.803
IT'S 2:30.

09:32.803 --> 09:34.905
THEN YOU HAVE
EXACTLY ONE HOUR.

09:37.007 --> 09:41.852
"DAVID, 'UNTIL FOREVER,'
VICTORIA."

09:45.055 --> 09:47.988
YOUR FATHER DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HIT HIM, DID HE?

09:47.988 --> 09:50.921
TICK-TOCK.

09:53.063 --> 09:55.866
(watch clinks)

09:55.866 --> 09:56.997
(clatters)

10:03.133 --> 10:04.805
(buzzer sounds)

10:04.805 --> 10:06.176
(door opens)

10:06.176 --> 10:08.108
(door closes)

10:18.789 --> 10:21.952
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN,
BATGIRL?

10:26.026 --> 10:27.758
(exhales)

10:27.758 --> 10:28.829
(grunts)

10:28.829 --> 10:30.000
(inhales sharply)

10:30.000 --> 10:32.032
(grunts)

10:32.032 --> 10:34.064
(laughs)

10:34.064 --> 10:35.866
I'M NOT WORTHY.

10:35.866 --> 10:37.868
GET UP, NOLAN.
YOU HAVE TO DELIVER

10:37.868 --> 10:39.840
GRAYSON'S BOX OF EVIDENCE
TO THE FEDS.
 (groans)

10:39.840 --> 10:41.912
EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS IN
THE BOTTOM DRAWER OF YOUR DESK,

10:41.912 --> 10:43.774
INCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS
ON HOW TO GET IT

10:43.774 --> 10:44.845
TO AGENT McGOWEN.
 (buzzer sounds)

10:44.845 --> 10:45.976
GOT IT?

10:45.976 --> 10:47.878
(grunts)
 THEN GET GOING.

10:47.878 --> 10:50.020
NO.
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU HERE.

10:50.020 --> 10:53.854
YOU ARE WAY OUTMATCHED
BY THAT CRAZY ALBINO.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.756
NOLAN, I'M STAYING.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.887
IF YOU DON'T GO NOW,

10:56.887 --> 10:58.759
THEN ALL OF THIS
WILL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.933
YOU OWE ME THAT.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.898
KICK HIS ASS.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.976
NOLAN.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.049
IF I DON'T
MAKE IT OUT OF THIS...

11:19.049 --> 11:21.051
TELL JACK
THAT I LOVE HIM.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.758
(buzzer sounds)

11:27.758 --> 11:29.119
(door closes)

11:29.119 --> 11:31.762
OKAY, WHAT'S OUR GAME PLAN
FOR ECON,

11:31.762 --> 11:33.093
SICK GRANDMA,
COMPUTER CRASH?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.825
I DON'T HAVE
A GAME PLAN,

11:34.825 --> 11:36.026
ASIDE FROM REPEATING
SENIOR YEAR.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.868
AT LEAST IF WE FAIL,
WE FAIL TOGETHER, RIGHT?

11:37.868 --> 11:38.999
THAT'S--YEAH.
YEAH.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.071
IF YOU WANT MR. HIBBARD
TO GIVE YOU AN EXTENSION,

11:41.071 --> 11:43.934
ALL YOU NEED
IS A SYMPATHETIC EXCUSE.

11:43.934 --> 11:46.837
LIKE TELLING HIM HOW YOU
VERBALLY ACCOSTED US LAST NIGHT?

11:46.837 --> 11:49.009
YOU KNOW THAT WEIRD
ROSE-COLORED LAMP

11:49.009 --> 11:50.981
ON MR. HIBBARD'S DESK?

11:50.981 --> 11:54.014
IT'S ACTUALLY THERAPY
FOR SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.116
TELL HIM YOU HAVE IT, TOO.
 S.A.D.?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.048
LIKE SAD?
THAT'S A REAL THING?

11:58.048 --> 11:59.920
IT IS TO HIM.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.922
THE CLASSES MIGHT BE HARD HERE,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.794
BUT THE TEACHERS
ARE PUSHOVERS.

12:03.794 --> 12:06.857
PROBABLY A LOT DIFFERENT THAN
PUBLIC SCHOOL IN YONKERS.

12:06.857 --> 12:08.999
I WENT TO ST. JAMES ACADEMY.
IT WAS PRIVATE.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.061
(bell rings)

12:11.061 --> 12:14.004
YOU GUYS
BETTER GET IN THERE.

12:14.004 --> 12:17.007
(indistinct conversations)

12:18.138 --> 12:19.870
THANK YOU.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.141
JAIME SEEMS NICE.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.013
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU.

12:23.013 --> 12:26.046
(indistinct conversations
continue)

12:30.150 --> 12:32.983
(Daniel) YEAH, BE SURE
TO CHANGE ALL THE PASS CODES.

12:32.983 --> 12:34.124
WE'RE IN FULL LOCKDOWN.

12:34.124 --> 12:35.185
(cell phone beeps)

12:35.185 --> 12:36.887
GRAYSON.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.959
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:38.959 --> 12:41.962
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:41.962 --> 12:44.965
I'VE DECIDED I PREFER
TO LIVE DEBT-FREE.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.096
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

12:46.096 --> 12:48.899
THERE WAS NO CONFUSION
ABOUT THAT.

12:48.899 --> 12:50.200
GOOD.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.843
HAVE A NICE DAY.

12:52.843 --> 12:55.105
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

12:55.105 --> 12:57.908
THAT BOY IS AN AWFULLY LONG
WAY FROM MONTAUK.

12:57.908 --> 12:59.910
YOU'D THINK
A MILLION DOLLARS

12:59.910 --> 13:02.853
WOULD TRUMP ANYONE'S SENSE
OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS.

13:02.853 --> 13:04.054
(chuckles)
I WOULDN'T BE SO QUICK

13:04.054 --> 13:06.116
TO DUB JACK PORTER
A SAINT.

13:06.116 --> 13:08.959
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

13:08.959 --> 13:10.891
NOTHING.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.962
ASH, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD KNOW,

13:11.962 --> 13:13.023
YOU GOTTA TELL ME.

13:13.023 --> 13:14.164
LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT HIM.

13:14.164 --> 13:15.966
IT'S ALSO ABOUT EMILY,
SO YOU--

13:15.966 --> 13:18.028
YOU REALLY NEED
TO BE ASKING HER.

13:18.028 --> 13:19.930
WELL, I'M ASKING YOU.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.972
I THOUGHT I COULD TRUST YOU.

13:21.972 --> 13:24.074
(woman)
GRAYSON GLOBAL. PLEASE HOLD.

13:24.074 --> 13:27.007
HELLO, MISS CHARLOTTE.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.910
MOM?

13:38.989 --> 13:42.192
(keypad beeping)

13:42.192 --> 13:45.025
(phone rings)

13:45.025 --> 13:46.096
(line clicks)

13:46.096 --> 13:47.227
(man) Jenkins Investigations.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.129
HELLO,
IS THIS DAN JENKINS?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.901
Uh, yes, it is.

13:50.901 --> 13:51.962
And who is this?

13:51.962 --> 13:53.033
IT'S VICTORIA GRAYSON.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.234
What can I do for you?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.266
I NEED EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIND
ON A SENIOR AT COLLINS PREP

13:56.266 --> 13:59.940
WHOM I BELIEVE
IS BULLYING MY DAUGHTER.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.113
(Conrad) WE HAVE TO DISAPPEAR
FOR A WHILE.

14:03.113 --> 14:04.174
(latches click)

14:04.174 --> 14:05.916
DISAPPEAR, WHERE?

14:05.916 --> 14:07.277
CAYMANS,

14:07.277 --> 14:08.949
SOMEWHERE SAFE,

14:08.949 --> 14:11.952
SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN
PLAN MY NEXT MOVE.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.984
VICTORIA SOLD US OUT,
DIDN'T SHE?

14:13.984 --> 14:16.126
YEAH, THAT HARPY'S
TOXIC CRUSADE

14:16.126 --> 14:18.989
HAS ROUSED THE INTEREST OF
A FAR MORE DANGEROUS ADVERSARY

14:18.989 --> 14:20.931
THAN OUR GOVERNMENT.

14:20.931 --> 14:22.062
CONRAD, I--

14:22.062 --> 14:24.234
I KNOW, IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

14:24.234 --> 14:26.236
SO PLEASE...

14:26.236 --> 14:29.069
ACCEPT THIS AS A TOKEN
OF MY APPRECIATION

14:29.069 --> 14:33.073
FOR YOUR CONTINUED LOYALTY.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.945
THIS...

14:34.945 --> 14:36.947
IS A PROMISE

14:36.947 --> 14:38.148
TO ALWAYS KEEP YOU
OUT OF HARM'S WAY

14:38.148 --> 14:39.950
AS LONG
AS WE STICK TOGETHER.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.051
NOW...

14:41.051 --> 14:44.084
ALL I ASK IN RETURN
IS YOUR ASSURANCE

14:44.084 --> 14:47.217
THAT THE DOOR SWINGS
BOTH WAYS.

14:47.217 --> 14:49.089
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.190
(chuckles)

14:52.222 --> 14:53.293
MM.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.968
YES, CONRAD.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.301
(indistinct conversations)

15:01.301 --> 15:03.333
(cell phone rings)

15:03.333 --> 15:07.978
(indistinct conversations
continue)

15:25.055 --> 15:26.126
(clatters)

15:28.058 --> 15:31.061
(clock chiming)

15:34.134 --> 15:35.205
(buzzer sounds)

15:35.205 --> 15:36.306
(door opens)

15:36.306 --> 15:39.039
YOU'VE MADE
A GRAVE MISCALCULATION,

15:39.039 --> 15:40.240
MS. CLARKE.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.213
(bells tolling)

15:43.213 --> 15:44.274
(door closes)

15:44.274 --> 15:47.147
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.079
YOU AND I MAY HAVE

15:49.079 --> 15:52.282
MORE IN COMMON
THANK YOU REALIZE.

15:52.282 --> 15:55.085
MY EMPLOYERS AND I PLANNED
TO MAKE GRAYSON TAKE THE FALL

15:55.085 --> 15:58.028
FOR FLIGHT 197,
NOT YOUR FATHER.

15:58.028 --> 16:00.360
I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE OF
HOW MY FATHER WAS FRAMED.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.234
I'M HERE
BECAUSE OF HOW HE DIED.

16:04.234 --> 16:06.396
(both grunting)

16:06.396 --> 16:10.040
(hissing)

16:13.273 --> 16:16.176
(both grunting)

16:22.212 --> 16:24.254
(grunts)
 YOU'RE A HELL OF A FIGHTER.

16:24.254 --> 16:26.386
YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN THAT
FROM YOUR MOTHER.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.417
(grunts)
 OHH!

16:31.361 --> 16:32.422
OHH!

16:32.422 --> 16:36.066
(Emily grunting and panting)

16:38.098 --> 16:40.270
(groans and grunts)

16:44.104 --> 16:46.336
(grunts and groans)

16:48.138 --> 16:49.139
OHH!

16:51.211 --> 16:52.342
LOOK AT ME.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.114
(panting)

16:54.114 --> 16:56.116
I WANT TO BE THE LAST THING
YOU SEE BEFORE YOU DIE.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.248
(grunting)

16:58.248 --> 17:00.420
(Amanda) YOU SURE HE'S READY,
DADDY?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.292
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.154
(gasps)
 (laughs)

17:04.154 --> 17:06.356
OH, WE DID IT, DADDY!
WE SAVED HIS LIFE.

17:06.356 --> 17:10.160
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT YOU MOST?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.362
IT'S THE WAY YOU LOVE
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING

17:12.362 --> 17:15.135
AND ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.308
YOU PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA LOSE THAT.

17:18.308 --> 17:21.211
(panting)

17:21.211 --> 17:22.372
(groaning)

17:22.372 --> 17:25.474
(coughing)

17:25.474 --> 17:28.377
(wheezes)

17:28.377 --> 17:30.150
(coughs)

17:30.150 --> 17:31.451
I THOUGHT YOU CAME HERE
TO HONOR YOUR FATHER.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.483
(panting)
I JUST DID.

17:33.483 --> 17:36.226
(coughs)

17:40.790 --> 17:42.632
YOU ARE A WOMAN
OF YOUR WORD.

17:42.632 --> 17:44.834
THE EVIDENCE THAT YOUR HUSBAND
SQUIRRELED AWAY IS ENCYCLOPEDIC,

17:44.834 --> 17:46.696
AND WE'RE ONLY
HALFWAY THROUGH IT.

17:46.696 --> 17:48.168
I WISH I COULD TAKE CREDIT
FOR DELIVERING IT TO YOU,

17:48.168 --> 17:49.699
MR. McGOWEN,

17:49.699 --> 17:51.101
BUT IT WAS MY SON
WHO ULTIMATELY

17:51.101 --> 17:53.143
PLACED IT SAFELY
INTO YOUR HANDS.

17:53.143 --> 17:54.744
WELL, IF ANYTHING COULD TURN
YOUR BOY'S IMAGE AROUND,

17:54.744 --> 17:56.146
THIS OUGHT TO DO IT.

17:56.146 --> 17:57.807
ON THE DOWNSIDE,

17:57.807 --> 18:00.810
LYDIA DAVIS HAS RECANTED
HER TESTIMONY

18:00.810 --> 18:03.753
AND WON'T BE JOINING US
ON OUR TRIP TO WASHINGTON.

18:03.753 --> 18:05.155
YOU DON'T SEEM SURPRISED.

18:05.155 --> 18:06.816
CONRAD IS A CUNNING MAN,

18:06.816 --> 18:09.859
AND LYDIA'S THE VERY DEFINITION
OF MALLEABLE.

18:09.859 --> 18:11.861
I'LL WORK ON HER.

18:11.861 --> 18:13.723
WELL, EVEN WITHOUT MS. DAVIS'
CORROBORATING TESTIMONY,

18:13.723 --> 18:14.864
WE ALREADY
HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

18:14.864 --> 18:16.726
TO BRING CHARGES
OF MURDER-FOR-HIRE.

18:16.726 --> 18:18.198
MURDER?

18:18.198 --> 18:19.729
YEAH.

18:19.729 --> 18:22.732
IT APPEARS YOUR HUSBAND
DIDN'T JUST FRAME DAVID CLARKE.

18:22.732 --> 18:24.734
HE ALSO CONTRACTED
TO HAVE HIM KILLED.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.822
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.694
(jangles keys)

18:44.694 --> 18:47.757
SORRY.
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY DAY.

18:47.757 --> 18:51.161
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

18:51.161 --> 18:52.802
YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:52.802 --> 18:55.235
YEAH, I JUST FELL ON THE ICE
WHEN I WAS RUNNING.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.767
I DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY YOU WITH
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.909
SURE.
WHAT'S ONE MORE SECRET?

18:59.909 --> 19:01.911
IT'S HARDLY THE BIGGEST ONE
YOU'RE KEEPING, RIGHT?

19:04.914 --> 19:06.716
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW,
DANIEL?

19:06.716 --> 19:08.718
I'M AN OPEN BOOK TONIGHT.

19:08.718 --> 19:11.181
JACK CAME BY HERE YESTERDAY,
DIDN'T HE?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.785
YEAH.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.889
HIS DOG DIED.

19:19.889 --> 19:21.861
DID YOU KISS HIM?

19:23.793 --> 19:27.197
JUST GIVE ME
A STRAIGHT ANSWER, PLEASE.

19:27.197 --> 19:29.269
(sighs)

19:29.269 --> 19:31.901
YES.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.243
WE KISSED.

19:35.845 --> 19:37.747
SO ALL THESE MONTHS--

19:37.747 --> 19:38.878
THE ENGAGEMENT,

19:38.878 --> 19:40.280
STANDING BY ME
DURING THE TRIAL--

19:40.280 --> 19:42.181
WHAT--WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF ALL THAT

19:42.181 --> 19:45.815
IF YOU JUST REALLY
WANTED TO BE WITH HIM?

19:45.815 --> 19:46.956
OR WAS MY MOTHER RIGHT?

19:46.956 --> 19:49.759
WERE YOU JUST...
PRETENDING TO LOVE ME

19:49.759 --> 19:51.921
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
THE GRAYSON NAME?

19:51.921 --> 19:54.294
NO.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.267
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU
DESPITE THE GRAYSON NAME.

19:57.267 --> 19:59.229
THEN WHAT CHANGED?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.274
THE TRUTH IS...
(exhales)

20:04.274 --> 20:07.206
I'M NOT...

20:07.206 --> 20:10.310
REALLY THE PERSON THAT
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH.

20:13.243 --> 20:15.245
AND YOU'RE CHANGING, TOO.

20:15.245 --> 20:17.247
I MEAN...

20:17.247 --> 20:18.848
I'M WATCHING YOU BECOME

20:18.848 --> 20:22.922
EVERYTHING YOU SAID
YOU NEVER WANTED TO BE.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.324
AND WHAT'S THAT?

20:27.257 --> 20:29.929
A GRAYSON.

20:47.317 --> 20:48.918
I'M SORRY.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.355
(voice breaks)
GOOD-BYE, EMILY.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.894
(door closes)

21:11.371 --> 21:14.844
SO YOU'RE DENYING
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE

21:14.844 --> 21:16.846
WHO BROKE INTO MY SOON-TO-BE
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S HOUSE

21:16.846 --> 21:18.047
AND STOLE THE EVIDENCE?

21:18.047 --> 21:20.279
I DENY EVERYTHING, GRAYSON.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.051
DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT GUILTY.

21:22.051 --> 21:23.383
AND WHERE IS IT NOW?

21:23.383 --> 21:25.985
LAST I HEARD, IT WAS WITH
FEDERAL AGENT McGOWEN,

21:25.985 --> 21:28.388
WHO'S LEAVING FOR
WASHINGTON, D.C. TOMORROW

21:28.388 --> 21:30.890
TO PRESENT EVERYTHING
HE'S FOUND TO A FEDERAL JUDGE.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.291
VICTORIA.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.364
THE GOVERNMENT'S
STAR WITNESS.

21:34.364 --> 21:37.066
THEY'VE ALSO OFFERED
YOUR MISTRESS IMMUNITY

21:37.066 --> 21:39.329
IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER TESTIMONY.

21:39.329 --> 21:42.001
WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY
NOT HERE TO GLOAT.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.974
THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN THERE
TO BRING US ALL DOWN.

21:44.974 --> 21:46.436
I DEFINITELY DID NOT
COME HERE TO GLOAT.

21:46.436 --> 21:50.039
THEN WHAT, TO KILL ME?

21:50.039 --> 21:51.381
IF I WANTED TO KILL YOU,

21:51.381 --> 21:53.943
WE WOULD NOT BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION, TRUST ME.

21:53.943 --> 21:55.385
(chuckles) TRUST YOU?

21:55.385 --> 21:56.916
THAT'S RICH.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.949
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT MY SON'S FIANCEE

21:59.949 --> 22:01.451
WOULD JUST IMAGINE
SEEING A WHITE-HAIRED MAN

22:01.451 --> 22:03.052
IN THE KITCHEN
THIS MORNING?

22:03.052 --> 22:04.924
BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.996
IF I WANTED TO KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU,

22:06.996 --> 22:10.930
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS
TO DO IT UNDETECTED.

22:12.362 --> 22:13.933
IF I WERE YOU,

22:13.933 --> 22:16.065
I WOULD MAKE GOOD ON
YOUR PROMISE TO LEAVE TOWN.

22:16.065 --> 22:18.438
THIS TIME NEXT WEEK,
BEING CONRAD GRAYSON

22:18.438 --> 22:20.109
MIGHT PROVE TO BE
A VERY TRICKY PROPOSITION.

22:20.109 --> 22:21.411
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

22:21.411 --> 22:22.972
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.116
I'M ALREADY ON MY WAY
TO THE AIRPORT.

22:27.116 --> 22:28.918
(door opens)

22:28.918 --> 22:30.049
(door closes)

22:30.049 --> 22:33.052
(Victoria)
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22:33.052 --> 22:35.024
I BROKE THINGS OFF
WITH EMILY.

22:35.024 --> 22:37.056
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.458
SURE YOU DO.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.460
YOU'VE BEEN ANGLING FOR THIS
SINCE THE DAY EMILY AND I MET.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.492
SO TAKE YOUR VICTORY LAP.
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

22:42.492 --> 22:44.093
CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU THINK,

22:44.093 --> 22:47.497
I CAN'T BEAR
TO SEE YOU HURT.

22:49.138 --> 22:51.140
I KNEW I COULD TRUST YOU
TO DO THE RIGHT THING

22:51.140 --> 22:53.403
AND TURN OVER THE EVIDENCE.

22:53.403 --> 22:56.075
I DIDN'T TURN OVER ANYTHING.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.407
I WAS GONNA GIVE IT TO DAD,

22:57.407 --> 22:59.078
BUT SOMEONE WITH A BIGGER AX
TO GRIND THAN YOURSELF

22:59.078 --> 23:00.149
INTERCEPTED IT.

23:00.149 --> 23:01.951
NOW I AM BEGGING YOU
AS YOUR SON,

23:01.951 --> 23:03.513
PLEASE DROP THIS WHOLE THING.

23:03.513 --> 23:05.415
TELL McGOWEN
YOU WON'T TESTIFY.

23:05.415 --> 23:07.116
I CAN'T DO THAT.

23:07.116 --> 23:09.489
IT'S TIME FOR THE TRUTH
TO FINALLY COME OUT.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.421
AND WHAT, TO HELL WITH
THE COST TO THE REST OF US?

23:11.421 --> 23:14.163
YOUR FATHER
HAD DAVID CLARKE MURDERED!

23:14.163 --> 23:15.525
WELL, HE MUST HAVE HAD
A DAMN GOOD REASON.

23:15.525 --> 23:17.096
(grunts)

23:26.506 --> 23:30.440
I'M NOT DENYING
HE'S DONE TERRIBLE THINGS,

23:30.440 --> 23:31.981
BUT SO HAVE YOU.

23:31.981 --> 23:33.112
AT LEAST HE CAN ALWAYS SAY

23:33.112 --> 23:35.985
IT WAS IN THE INTEREST
OF PROTECTING HIS FAMILY.

23:35.985 --> 23:37.517
OH, BELIEVE WHAT YOU MUST,
DANIEL.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.489
WHAT ABOUT CHARLOTTE, MOM?

23:39.489 --> 23:41.020
YOU MIGHT PUSH HER
EVEN FURTHER OVER THE EDGE.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.151
WE MIGHT NEVER GET HER BACK.

23:42.151 --> 23:44.123
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF CHARLOTTE.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.425
OH, YEAH, YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB SO FAR.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.005
I HAVE DONE SOME HEINOUS THINGS
IN MY LIFE,

23:56.005 --> 23:59.208
BUT NOW I HAVE THE CHANCE
TO RIGHT A TERRIBLE WRONG.

23:59.208 --> 24:01.140
AND NOTHING AND NOBODY,

24:01.140 --> 24:03.142
NOT EVEN YOU,
MY DARLING SON,

24:03.142 --> 24:05.144
WILL STAND IN MY WAY.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.046
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.557
Lydia, it's Victoria.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.489
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.090
Lydia, be sensible.

24:21.090 --> 24:23.192
THEY'RE NOT JUST CHARGING CONRAD
WITH FRAMING DAVID CLARKE.

24:23.192 --> 24:25.464
THEY'RE CHARGING HIM
FOR HIS MURDER, TOO.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.167
You have a very small window
of opportunity

24:28.167 --> 24:29.499
to protect yourself.

24:29.499 --> 24:32.471
ADVICE FROM
THE SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY?

24:32.471 --> 24:33.673
I think I'll pass.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.575
WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR PLAN,
HMM,

24:35.575 --> 24:38.147
to live your life on the lamb
with an international fugitive?

24:38.147 --> 24:40.249
CONRAD'S NOT THE ENEMY,
VICTORIA.

24:40.249 --> 24:41.581
You are.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.252
WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE
THE FIRST PERSON HE SELLS OUT

24:43.252 --> 24:44.584
WHEN THE MONEY RUNS DRY?

24:44.584 --> 24:47.216
And believe me,
that day is coming faster

24:47.216 --> 24:49.519
than either one of you
realizes.

24:49.519 --> 24:51.561
BECAUSE WHEN I AM DONE
WITH HIM,

24:51.561 --> 24:53.593
IT WILL MAKE
YOUR TAXI-CAB BOUNCE

24:53.593 --> 24:55.525
LOOK LIKE A TRIP
TO SAINT-TROPEZ.

24:55.525 --> 24:57.496
GOOD. YOU'RE PACKED.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.669
THE PLANE BOARDS
AT 8:00 P.M.

24:59.669 --> 25:03.202
I'LL HAVE OUR BAGS
TAKEN DOWN TO THE CAR.

25:04.674 --> 25:07.136
OH, WHO WAS THAT
ON THE PHONE?

25:07.136 --> 25:09.208
UH, MY MOTHER.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.140
I HAVE TO GET RIGHT BACK
TO PHILLY.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.642
MY FATHER
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

25:14.544 --> 25:17.617
I'M SO SORRY.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.689
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
MY PLANE.

25:19.689 --> 25:21.290
NO, UM...

25:21.290 --> 25:23.623
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT
FOR WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.294
I...

25:25.294 --> 25:26.696
I COULD MEET YOU.

25:26.696 --> 25:29.559
NO, I'M GONNA
WAIT RIGHT HERE

25:29.559 --> 25:31.160
UNTIL YOU'RE READY.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.232
MY DRIVER WILL TAKE YOU
ANYWHERE YOU WISH,

25:33.232 --> 25:35.635
ALL THE WAY TO PHILLY,
IF YOU LIKE.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.267
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE BACK, CONRAD.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.312
I'M SORRY.

25:45.244 --> 25:48.277
THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.

25:48.277 --> 25:52.181
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

25:52.181 --> 25:54.183
GOOD-BYE, LYDIA.

26:11.641 --> 26:12.702
(pops)

26:12.702 --> 26:13.773
(cork bounces)

26:13.773 --> 26:16.205
CHAMPAGNE DOES NOT SEEM
APPROPRIATE,

26:16.205 --> 26:17.607
ESPECIALLY AT 9:00 A.M.

26:17.607 --> 26:21.310
OH, CHAMPAGNE
IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE.

26:21.310 --> 26:24.283
I MEAN, YOU GOT
YOUR POUND OF FLESH, EMS.

26:24.283 --> 26:27.687
THE GRAYSON FAMILY
IS MORE OR LESS DECIMATED,

26:27.687 --> 26:29.689
YOUR FATHER'S NAME'S
ABOUT TO BE CLEARED,

26:29.689 --> 26:30.760
AND...

26:30.760 --> 26:33.222
YOU GOT TO KICK
THE SHINOLA OUT OF LURCH.

26:33.222 --> 26:35.695
I DIDN'T DO IT ALONE,
NOLAN.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.226
THANK YOU.

26:37.226 --> 26:39.268
MM.

26:39.268 --> 26:41.330
SO...

26:41.330 --> 26:45.705
NOW THAT YOU'VE FINISHED
STORMING THE CASTLE...

26:45.705 --> 26:48.808
WHAT ABOUT PRINCE DANIEL,
HMM?

26:48.808 --> 26:51.240
WE ENDED THINGS.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.283
OH... WOW.

26:54.283 --> 26:55.815
SO...

26:55.815 --> 26:58.648
THAT JUST LEAVES...

26:58.648 --> 26:59.789
JACK?

26:59.789 --> 27:01.350
(chuckles)

27:01.350 --> 27:04.253
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
TELL HIM?

27:04.253 --> 27:06.395
(inhales deeply)

27:06.395 --> 27:08.658
EVERYTHING.

27:08.658 --> 27:10.760
(chuckles)

27:10.760 --> 27:13.402
(chuckles)

27:15.735 --> 27:16.806
(cell phone beeps)

27:16.806 --> 27:18.808
(cell phone rings)

27:18.808 --> 27:21.410
(ring)

27:21.410 --> 27:22.672
(beeps)

27:22.672 --> 27:23.743
(Emily) Jack.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.715
HEY.
I WAS STARTING TO WONDER

27:25.715 --> 27:27.817
IF I WAS EVER
GONNA HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.

27:27.817 --> 27:29.348
(sighs deeply)

27:29.348 --> 27:31.751
YEAH, SORRY. THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE CRAZY.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.352
YEAH.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.354
YEAH,
THEY HAVE FOR ME, TOO.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.756
LISTEN...

27:36.756 --> 27:39.759
I FOUND SAMMY'S COLLAR.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.692
I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD
BRING IT BY LATER TONIGHT.

27:42.692 --> 27:45.364
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
I'D LIKE MORE.

27:45.364 --> 27:46.866
I'M HERE, SO...

27:46.866 --> 27:49.769
COME BY
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

27:51.741 --> 27:52.802
(chuckles)

27:52.802 --> 27:53.873
(cell phone beeps)

27:53.873 --> 27:55.344
I'M PROUD OF YOU, EMS.

27:57.707 --> 27:59.408
HERE'S TO YOUR DAD.

27:59.408 --> 28:01.751
TO DAD.

28:01.751 --> 28:03.753
(clinks)

28:03.753 --> 28:05.354
I CAN'T BELIEVE
PROFESSOR HIBBARD

28:05.354 --> 28:06.756
GAVE ME HIS HAPPY LAMP.
(laughs)

28:06.756 --> 28:08.357
YEAH, BUT WE'RE STILL
GONNA FAIL THIS PROJECT

28:08.357 --> 28:11.390
IF YOU DON'T START HELPING ME,
SO HELP ME.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.423
(indistinct conversations)

28:14.423 --> 28:15.795
(chirps)

28:15.795 --> 28:17.767
(boy) LOOK AT THESE.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.398
LOOK AT THIS.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.870
(laughter)

28:20.870 --> 28:22.872
LOOKS LIKE
THE JOKE'S ON US.

28:22.872 --> 28:25.474
(laughter continues)

28:25.474 --> 28:27.436
(clicks mouse)

28:27.436 --> 28:32.411
(indistinct conversations
and laughter)

28:32.411 --> 28:33.813
WHAT--WHAT IS THIS?

28:33.813 --> 28:35.484
(clicks, beeps)

28:35.484 --> 28:36.846
OH, MY GOD.

28:36.846 --> 28:38.748
(click, beep)

28:38.748 --> 28:40.719
TH-THE JUDGE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BURY THIS.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.851
I WAS A MINOR.

28:41.851 --> 28:43.823
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHO IS THAT GUY?

28:43.823 --> 28:46.495
MY HISTORY TEACHER.

28:46.495 --> 28:48.427
(indistinct conversations
and laughter continue)

28:48.427 --> 28:49.929
SLUT. (coughs)

28:49.929 --> 28:53.903
(laughter continues)

28:55.765 --> 28:59.408
(laughter continues)

28:59.408 --> 29:01.510
AND WE THOUGHT YOU LOWERED
YOURSELF TO DATE ME, RIGHT?

29:01.510 --> 29:03.773
CLEARLY, I'M THE ONE THAT
LOWERED MYSELF TO DATE YOU.

29:03.773 --> 29:05.945
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOUR NEW CRUSH IS A TRAMP.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.377
I DID YOU A FAVOR.

29:08.377 --> 29:10.920
YOU REALLY ARE
YOUR MOTHER'S DAUGHTER.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.752
YOU DON'T EVER TALK TO ME
AGAIN, YOU GOT IT?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.885
(students) OOH.

29:15.885 --> 29:18.487
(indistinct conversations
continue)

29:18.487 --> 29:19.959
OOPS. (laughs)

29:19.959 --> 29:21.791
(students laugh)

29:21.791 --> 29:24.763
(knock on door)

29:28.397 --> 29:29.498
VICTORIA.

29:29.498 --> 29:31.400
COME IN.

29:32.942 --> 29:36.946
I HEARD YOU TOOK
A NASTY SPILL.

29:36.946 --> 29:38.948
I'M FINE.

29:38.948 --> 29:42.912
DANIEL TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR BREAKUP.

29:42.912 --> 29:45.915
I WANTED TO OFFER YOU
MY CONDOLENCES IN PERSON.

29:45.915 --> 29:48.958
MM. I CAN FEEL
YOUR DEVASTATION.

29:48.958 --> 29:52.491
MAYBE NOW THE TWO OF YOU
CAN MOVE ON

29:52.491 --> 29:55.424
AND FIND SOMEONE
MORE APPROPRIATE.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.430
I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE
WANTING THIS BACK.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.805
THE ENGAGEMENT GIFT?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.577
NO. DON'T BE ABSURD.

30:08.577 --> 30:09.979
WHY DON'T YOU OPEN IT?

30:26.926 --> 30:28.527
YOU SEE, EVEN LONG BEFORE

30:28.527 --> 30:29.959
THE DAY
OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

30:29.959 --> 30:32.501
I KNEW THAT YOUR FUTURE
WITH DANIEL

30:32.501 --> 30:35.965
WAS AS EMPTY AS THAT BOX.

30:35.965 --> 30:39.568
WELL, BEST OF LUCK
WITH YOUR NEXT ENDEAVOR.

30:41.911 --> 30:43.943
(door opens)

30:43.943 --> 30:47.016
(door closes)

30:49.618 --> 30:52.551
(sighs)

31:14.503 --> 31:16.575
HEY.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.907
(sighs)

31:17.907 --> 31:19.048
HI.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.882
SLOW NIGHT, HUH?

31:23.882 --> 31:24.984
I CLOSED UP EARLY.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.055
MM.

31:28.057 --> 31:30.059
ARE YOU OKAY?

31:30.059 --> 31:32.021
I'M FINE. UH...

31:32.021 --> 31:35.064
YOU SHOULD SEE
THE OTHER GUY. (chuckles)

31:35.064 --> 31:36.665
(both chuckle)

31:36.665 --> 31:38.597
(collar clinks)

31:38.597 --> 31:41.030
I THINK THIS BELONGS
TO YOU.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.903
ACTUALLY,

31:44.903 --> 31:47.636
IT BELONGS TO AMANDA.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.041
SAMMY WAS MY DOG,
AFTER ALL.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.045
AMANDA.

31:56.045 --> 31:59.918
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.550
OH, MY GOD.

32:01.550 --> 32:02.952
(chuckles)

32:02.952 --> 32:05.594
I KNOW, RIGHT?

32:05.594 --> 32:08.057
JACK AND I
ARE GONNA HAVE A BABY.

32:12.701 --> 32:14.633
W-WOW.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.565
CONGRATULATIONS.

32:16.565 --> 32:18.567
(chuckles)

32:18.567 --> 32:21.110
I'M SURE YOU BOTH HAVE
A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.

32:21.110 --> 32:25.644
JUST... WANTED TO RETURN
THE COLLAR.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.716
JACK TOLD ME
WHAT YOU DID FOR SAMMY.

32:27.716 --> 32:30.980
IF IT COULDN'T BE ME,
I'M GLAD IT WAS YOU.

32:32.121 --> 32:33.722
I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

32:33.722 --> 32:36.055
NO. DON'T.

32:38.727 --> 32:40.589
GOOD-BYE, JACK.

32:46.035 --> 32:47.136
(door closes)

33:00.709 --> 33:03.082
(sniffles)

33:03.082 --> 33:05.154
(exhales)

33:31.210 --> 33:32.281
(door opens)

33:32.281 --> 33:33.342
(Ashley) KNOCK-KNOCK.

33:33.342 --> 33:36.145
HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING.

33:36.145 --> 33:38.217
NOTHING TO INTERRUPT.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.419
I HEARD...

33:40.419 --> 33:42.251
ABOUT YOU AND EMILY.

33:42.251 --> 33:44.253
I'M SO SORRY, DANIEL.

33:44.253 --> 33:46.155
WHAT CAN I DO?

33:46.155 --> 33:48.327
YOU CAN HAVE A DRINK
WITH ME.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.429
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

33:50.429 --> 33:54.163
YOU GOT A BETTER ONE?
 (pours liquid)

34:02.471 --> 34:05.174
I MADE A MISTAKE
TELLING YOU,

34:05.174 --> 34:06.345
DIDN'T I?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.476
WELL, IT'S BETTER
TO FIND OUT

34:07.476 --> 34:09.217
THAT MY FIANCEE
IS CHEATING ON ME

34:09.217 --> 34:10.449
BEFORE SHE'S MY WIFE.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.453
GOOD TO KNOW
YOU'VE GOT MY BACK.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.525
ALWAYS HAVE.

34:19.188 --> 34:20.529
CHEERS.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.333
(clinks)

34:25.333 --> 34:26.395
CHEERS.

34:28.397 --> 34:30.498
(knock on door)

34:30.498 --> 34:33.302
(Victoria) CHARLOTTE.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.476
I'M HEADED OFF
TO THE AIRPORT NOW.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.277
WHY?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.210
WELL, I TOLD YOU,

34:41.210 --> 34:43.212
I'M GOING TO WASHINGTON.

34:43.212 --> 34:45.313
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:49.257 --> 34:50.518
HAS GETTING RETRIBUTION

34:50.518 --> 34:53.362
EVER MADE YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF?

34:55.324 --> 34:57.396
YES...

34:57.396 --> 34:59.398
WHEN THE OTHER PARTY
DESERVED IT.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.600
AND IF THEY DIDN'T?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.433
THEN YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF,
AND YOU MOVE ON,

35:04.433 --> 35:06.305
THE QUICKER, THE BETTER.

35:08.337 --> 35:10.339
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING AT ALL,

35:10.339 --> 35:12.241
I'M JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY?

35:20.619 --> 35:24.523
(knock on door)

35:24.523 --> 35:26.625
GOOD.
THEY'RE A LITTLE EARLY.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.297
(gasps)

35:28.297 --> 35:31.460
VICTORIA!

35:31.460 --> 35:33.402
I'M FULLY AWARE

35:33.402 --> 35:35.634
THAT I HAVE SQUANDERED
 ANY GOOD WILL

35:35.634 --> 35:37.606
THAT YOU HAVE EVER FELT
FOR ME.

35:37.606 --> 35:39.608
BUT I IMPLORE YOU,
THINK OF OUR CHILDREN,

35:39.608 --> 35:41.340
OF THEIR FUTURE.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.372
IF YOU REFUSE TO TESTIFY,
THEY MAY STILL HAVE ONE.

35:43.372 --> 35:46.415
COME ON. YOU HAVE A MORAL
OBLIGATION AS A PARENT--

35:46.415 --> 35:50.279
YOU COME IN MY HOUSE
AND YOU PREACH MORALITY?

35:50.279 --> 35:52.351
I KNOW THAT YOU ORDERED
DAVID CLARKE'S MURDER.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.622
DO NOT DENY IT.

35:53.622 --> 35:55.484
DAVID CLARKE'S DEATH
WAS DECIDED BY PEOPLE

35:55.484 --> 35:57.286
FAR ABOVE ME.

35:57.286 --> 35:58.557
THE VERY SAME PEOPLE
WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING

35:58.557 --> 36:01.360
TO DESTROY THE BOTH OF US
IF YOU DECIDE TO TESTIFY!

36:01.360 --> 36:03.462
WELL, THEN SO BE IT!

36:03.462 --> 36:05.434
I CANNOT LIVE THESE LIES
ANYMORE,

36:05.434 --> 36:07.296
AND NEITHER
WILL OUR CHILDREN!

36:07.296 --> 36:08.367
VICTORIA--

36:08.367 --> 36:09.438
WHAT?!

36:09.438 --> 36:11.440
IF YOU BOARD THAT PLANE...

36:11.440 --> 36:14.303
IT'S GONNA BE
THE LAST THING THAT YOU DO.

36:14.303 --> 36:16.445
THEN I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.

36:16.445 --> 36:17.606
MRS. GRAYSON,

36:17.606 --> 36:19.478
AGENT McGOWEN SENT ME
TO PICK YOU UP.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.580
LET'S NOT
KEEP THEM WAITING.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.682

36:40.499 --> 36:42.331
YEAH.

36:42.331 --> 36:43.672
YOU AND JACK HALFWAY TO

36:43.672 --> 36:46.605
THE LITTLE WHITE CHAPEL
IN ATLANTIC CITY YET?

36:46.605 --> 36:49.338
I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

36:49.338 --> 36:51.540
WHAT? EMS...

36:51.540 --> 36:53.482
why,
what are you waiting for?

36:53.482 --> 36:55.584
AMANDA'S BACK.

36:55.584 --> 36:58.387
She's pregnant.

36:58.387 --> 37:00.689
O.M.G.

37:00.689 --> 37:02.491
(sniffles)

37:02.491 --> 37:03.692
ALL RIGHT. UM...

37:03.692 --> 37:06.355
LOOK, JUST STAY
RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND...

37:06.355 --> 37:09.628
do not do anything revenge-y
until I get there, got it?

37:09.628 --> 37:12.531
Emily?

37:12.531 --> 37:14.463
YEAH.

37:14.463 --> 37:16.565

I, UH...

HANDLED THE COVER-UP.

41:29.918 --> 41:33.822

PAST THE GRAYSONS

THEY DID TO YOUR FATHER.

41:39.968 --> 41:41.930
HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT.

41:43.632 --> 41:44.873
IT'LL WORK
BECAUSE HE TRUSTS ME.

41:44.873 --> 41:47.636
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SURE?

YES.

IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE DEEPER,

41:56.785 --> 41:59.848
YOU'LL FIND THERE'S
MUCH MORE TO THE STORY.

41:59.848 --> 42:02.020
(Emily) WHAT IS SHE SAYING...

42:02.020 --> 42:04.893
