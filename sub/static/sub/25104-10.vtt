Narrator:
Tonight...

00:19.367 --> 00:21.195
We are going to try
something different.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.284
- ...the top 15...
- Find a partner right away.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.155
- Yo, guys, what's up?
- ...team up...

00:25.199 --> 00:27.201
...for a game of chicken.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.116
- Come on.
- A well-known ingredient.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.334
- Whoo!
- What the hell?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.336
I am not getting this off.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.556
- One great partner.
- Why did you slice it that way?

00:34.599 --> 00:38.299
- Piece of cake.
- I've seen better
in "Junior MasterChef."

00:38.342 --> 00:40.083
Who mauled this?

00:40.127 --> 00:42.694
And then,
a grueling challenge returns.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.131
- Contestants: Ooh!
- Oh!

00:44.174 --> 00:48.352
A dish that strikes fear
in the heart of every home cook.

00:48.396 --> 00:49.397
[ whistles ]

01:01.191 --> 01:03.715
- The top 15.
- [ cheers ]

01:03.759 --> 01:05.500
- Let's go, guys.
- Whoo!

01:05.543 --> 01:07.371
Ooh!

01:07.415 --> 01:09.112
I'm in the top 15!

01:09.156 --> 01:12.159
Each mentor has five aprons
left in the competition.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.464
Being one of the youngest,

01:13.508 --> 01:15.162
like, I did not expect
to make it this far,

01:15.205 --> 01:17.816
but I'm here for Gordon.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.601
Welcome back. Let's go!

01:19.644 --> 01:21.255
And I'm not going home
any time soon.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.170
- Yeah!
- What are these?

01:23.213 --> 01:26.260
Last month, I was in accounting,
closing the books.

01:26.303 --> 01:29.611
Now I'm out here closing in
to this MasterChef title.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.352
I'm looking at
the other home cooks.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.092
These are definitely
the cream of the crop.

01:34.442 --> 01:37.836
Okay, are all of you ready
for tonight's challenge?

01:37.880 --> 01:39.142
All: Yes!

01:39.186 --> 01:42.232
Tonight,
you'll be working...

01:43.190 --> 01:44.843
...in pairs.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.584
- [ sighs ]
- [ whistles ]

01:46.628 --> 01:48.412
And guess what.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.022
You can choose
your own partners.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.763
- [ whistles ]
- I love it.

01:51.807 --> 01:54.505
Please find a partner
right away.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.246
- Be my partner?
Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.206
Bowen:
I want to work with Shanika,

01:59.249 --> 02:01.860
because she has a lot
of knowledge about food.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.211
And she's always telling
the truth.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.169
She's not sugarcoating.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.215
I think most of the people,
they don't like it.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.868
Cesar.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.219
There's one individual
in particular

02:12.262 --> 02:15.352
that I would just be enamored
to be working with,
and that's Cesar.

02:15.396 --> 02:16.658
- Sir?
- I think there's a lot

02:16.701 --> 02:18.442
I can learn
from somebody like him.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.967
Oh, um, yo, what's up?
Yo, guys, what's up, dude?

02:22.011 --> 02:23.752
All right,
everyone's got a partner.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.754
I got left.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.886
- Ralph, you don't
have a partner.
- I got left out.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.412
- Ralph:
There is nobody left.
- Oh, my God.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.022
I feel like I just got picked
last in dodgeball.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.285
Like, this is
not a good feeling.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.331
Sorry, Ralph.

02:37.374 --> 02:41.030
Gordon: Now, tonight,
you all have to work with...

02:42.901 --> 02:44.338
- Nice.
- Ooh!

02:46.078 --> 02:48.646
...whole chicken, carrots,

02:48.690 --> 02:51.823
onion, bacon, and cornmeal,

02:51.867 --> 02:54.086
five stunning ingredients
that are really accessible

02:54.130 --> 02:57.220
to any American home cook.

02:57.264 --> 03:01.442
Gordon, Aarón, and I took those
five simple ingredients,

03:01.485 --> 03:03.835
and we each made
a different dish.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.359
- Ooh.
- Oh.

03:05.402 --> 03:09.319
Now, when I see
ingredients like this,

03:09.363 --> 03:13.584
my mind immediately goes
to classic Italian flavors.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.717
So, I made...

03:17.545 --> 03:19.503
chicken cacciatore

03:19.547 --> 03:22.027
with polenta
and crispy pancetta.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.942
Fantastic!

03:23.986 --> 03:25.466
For me, when I see
these five ingredients,

03:25.509 --> 03:27.685
the first thing
I thought about

03:27.729 --> 03:29.861
was incorporating
my Southern and Latin roots.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.299
So, I made...

03:32.342 --> 03:35.302
cornmeal crusted chicken thigh
with bacon jam,

03:35.345 --> 03:39.436
carrot and chipotle puree,
and fried onions.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.872
It doesn't get better
than that.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.702
Now, both those dishes
look amazing,

03:44.746 --> 03:48.706
but for me, I think
of the French countryside.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.536
So, here you have...

03:52.580 --> 03:54.712
an amazing
pan-seared chicken breast,

03:54.756 --> 03:58.760
spiced roasted carrots,
caramelized onions,

03:58.803 --> 04:01.328
and a beautiful polenta cake.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.418
- Amazing.
- Wow.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.333
Now, for you, Ralph,
listen carefully.

04:06.376 --> 04:09.640
- Yes, Chef.
- Since you don't
have a partner,

04:09.684 --> 04:12.339
tonight you get
to cook with...

04:15.994 --> 04:18.954
- ...your mentor,
Joe Bastianich.
- [ cheering ]

04:18.997 --> 04:21.870
Ralph:
Let's go, Joe!

04:21.913 --> 04:23.263
[ laughs ]

04:25.395 --> 04:27.702
Joe: Me and you, baby.
How lucky are you, bro?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.399
Ralph:
I got you, Joe.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.447
Here's the best news.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.752
You're also safe
from elimination.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.320
Oh, wow!

04:37.364 --> 04:39.453
Dude, no way.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.498
Joe, please join
the big man Ralph.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.457
- All right.
- Best of luck.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.764
- Whoo!
- Let's go.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.201
Let's go, bro. Wow.

04:49.245 --> 04:50.986
- This is the dream team.
- Dream team right here.

04:51.029 --> 04:54.816
All right, so,
home cooks and Joe,

04:54.859 --> 04:58.907
tonight you will have 45 minutes
to make an exquisite dish

04:58.950 --> 05:01.605
utilizing whole chicken, carrot,

05:01.649 --> 05:04.173
onion, bacon, and cornmeal.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.914
You'll also have access
to a pantry,

05:05.957 --> 05:08.482
that features a wide array
of ingredients

05:08.525 --> 05:11.398
that will help you personalize
all of your dishes.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.139
- Now, everybody, ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

05:14.183 --> 05:17.578
Your 45 minutes starts...

05:17.621 --> 05:19.928
- ...now. Let's go.
- Where we going?

05:19.971 --> 05:21.625
- This station over here.
- Come on, come on, come on.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.062
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking pakora waffle.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.063
- Yeah. It's--
- I think that's a cool idea.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.500
I love this.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.805
So, we'll do this
really quick.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.372
I'm happy to work with Taylor.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.419
We worked in
a field challenge together.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.421
- She stepped up as captain.
- I mean, we can do--

05:34.464 --> 05:36.597
also do one of the onions,
but if we can do the--

05:36.640 --> 05:38.163
And we both have a strong
respect for each other.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.644
I know that having her
as a partner

05:40.688 --> 05:43.299
is going to be stellar.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.259
All right, so we have five
ingredients here, Gordon,

05:47.303 --> 05:50.088
the chicken, the carrot,
the onion,

05:50.132 --> 05:52.047
the bacon,
and the cornmeal.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.614
A dream list of ingredients.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.267
You want me
to do both onions?

05:55.311 --> 05:56.965
I mean, you might as well
chop 'em up.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.271
These amateurs tonight
should be so familiar,

05:59.315 --> 06:03.058
but I want to see
an elevated dish,

06:03.101 --> 06:05.408
almost like
two signature dishes

06:05.452 --> 06:07.541
combining
into one unique plate.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.630
Aarón:
Absolutely.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.501
- I got acid of the wine,
acid of the lemon.
- All right.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.678
So, tonight, working in pairs,
Cesar and Mark...

06:14.722 --> 06:16.071
Polenta is there
in two minutes.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.812
- ...Chelsea and Samantha,
- What do you think?

06:17.855 --> 06:19.640
- Farhan and Emily,
- You wanna try that?

06:19.683 --> 06:22.643
- Shanika and Bowen,
- Hey, looking good, Bowen.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.645
- Ashley and Taylor,
- I think we got it.

06:24.688 --> 06:28.562
- Ryan and Gerron,
- A little garlic powder
for sure.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.434
- and Julia and S.J.
- Do you wanna do that thing
with the crispy skin?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.349
Yeah, sure.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.872
- Come on, come on.
- I got you.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.657
Joe:
I'm teaching him
everything I know.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.659
There's gonna be no
secrets left by the time
this is done.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.227
So, who do you think is
gonna shine tonight?

06:42.271 --> 06:43.577
Aarón:
I'm looking at Gerron and Ryan.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.622
They both have a love
for Southern flavors.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.016
- Sure.
- So, I'm looking for them
to be very successful.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.887
This polenta is
simply corn, right?

06:49.931 --> 06:52.107
- Corn just-- okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
just cornmeal.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.065
- Okay.
- But it's gonna add kind of
a more crunchy texture.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.459
- You have measuring cups
over there?
- Yeah.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.331
Ashley and Taylor, okay,
two of my girls.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.465
Yep. I think personally,
they're too friendly.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.467
They might not wanna say that
tough thing to one another.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
- Or correct one another.
- Exactly.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.384
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Do you have a spoon?

07:08.428 --> 07:09.951
- Need a spoon, need a spoon.
- This it?

07:09.994 --> 07:11.474
- Need a spoon. Yeah, yeah.
- Let me use it.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.085
Guys, 10 minutes gone.
35 minutes to go.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.481
We're kinda doing, like,
our play on some Southern foods,

07:18.525 --> 07:20.614
so we're doing
an Indian spice fried chicken,

07:20.657 --> 07:22.572
and then we're doing a pakora
waffle to go along with it,

07:22.616 --> 07:25.270
- with a hot lime--
- Like a hot chili lime
maple syrup.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.359
It's like my Southern
New Orleans style

07:27.403 --> 07:29.449
and his Indian style
coming together.
It's gonna be amazing.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.539
We're gonna do
a chicken breast,

07:32.582 --> 07:35.542
and we're gonna have, like,
a creamy onion sauce on top,

07:35.585 --> 07:38.327
and then we're gonna do
polenta cake with that.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.634
I'm taking lead on this,
and Samantha is here to taste

07:40.677 --> 07:43.158
and make sure everything
is executed correctly.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.641
We're doing a roast
chicken breast

07:47.684 --> 07:51.383
with a polenta cake,
carrot slaw, and onion sauce.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.734
We just collaborated
on different ideas

07:53.777 --> 07:55.997
and we work well together,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.086
- so it seems like
it's gonna work.
- Gordon: 20 minutes gone,

07:58.129 --> 08:01.916
25 minutes remaining.
Let's go.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.571
- Right, Cesar and Mark.
Tell me about the dish.
- Yes, Chef.

08:04.614 --> 08:08.096
- What we doing?
- We're gonna go
with caramelized onion,

08:08.139 --> 08:09.924
and bacon polenta cake, Chef.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.578
And then what we're gonna
with the chicken,

08:11.621 --> 08:13.667
we're gonna try
to make a roulade.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.582
I'm gonna make a mousse
out of the white meat.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.409
- Very complicated dish.
- It is.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.759
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.674
Hey, Ryan.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.718
I see that flambé
action, baby.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.633
- You like that?
- I like that.

08:23.677 --> 08:26.375
- Ryan, Gerron, what's going on?
- What's up, Chef?

08:26.418 --> 08:27.768
All right, so talk to me
about your dish.

08:27.811 --> 08:28.769
We're two Southern boys.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.206
We got some good
fried chicken going on.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.991
We got some cabbage,
we got some bacon and onion jam

08:34.035 --> 08:35.993
with some bourbon in there.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.822
- All right, good luck,
gentlemen, okay?
- Thank you, Chef.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.824
- Oh.
- It's looking terrible.

08:40.868 --> 08:44.828
- It looks terrible.
- That's my bad. Sorry.

08:44.872 --> 08:45.916
Okay.
What are we gonna do?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.701
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.920
Right, Ashley and Taylor.
Tell me about the dish.

08:49.964 --> 08:52.009
We are highlighting
our Southern roots.

08:52.053 --> 08:55.012
- Right.
- So, we're making cornbread
and a carrot puree.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.492
What's the onion shallots for?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.972
We wanted to have
an onion petal,

08:58.015 --> 09:00.365
and then put some
of the gravy inside.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.845
- Petal?
- Right.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.413
Where you brulée the onion
and then you peel--

09:04.456 --> 09:06.154
That's normally
in a cipollini

09:06.197 --> 09:07.634
or something smaller,
less harsh.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.418
Is it for visual
or is it for flavor?

09:09.461 --> 09:12.160
I've never done it before, Chef.
I wanted to taste it first.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.205
Why are you doing things,
testing them,

09:14.249 --> 09:15.598
that you've never
tasted before?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.212
It's just sounding
all over the place.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.258
Oh, my Lord.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.306
Who mauled this?

09:28.350 --> 09:31.614
Just answer me.
Who mauled this?

09:33.790 --> 09:36.445
I did, Chef. I twisted it
out of the joint.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.708
- Do you know how to
break down a chicken?
- Yes, Chef.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.057
- Do you know how
to break down--
- Yes, Chef.

09:40.101 --> 09:42.277
You're two girls
I believed in.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.236
I mean, I've seen
better performances

09:45.280 --> 09:47.630
in "Junior MasterChef"
with eight-year-olds.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.685
Oh, my Lord.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.817
[ blows raspberry ]

10:00.861 --> 10:03.733
Who mauled this?

10:03.777 --> 10:06.867
Just answer me.
Who mauled this?

10:06.910 --> 10:09.434
I did, Chef. I twisted it
out of the joint.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.786
I'm-- I'm just expecting
a better quality.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.265
You're two girls
I believed in.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.920
I mean, I've seen
better performances

10:16.964 --> 10:19.749
in "Junior MasterChef"
with eight-year-olds.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.665
- Get it together, girls.
- Yes, Chef.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.449
Gordon:
Oh, my Lord.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.887
Whoo, baby!

10:26.930 --> 10:29.106
The chicken's good.
It's ready to go.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.718
- Put it on here and then
put it in the blast chiller.
- I got you. I got you.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.937
- 11 minutes to go.
- Aarón: Let's go!

10:33.981 --> 10:37.114
- Gordon: Speed up, guys.
- Whoo!

10:37.158 --> 10:39.726
All right, so, Shanika, Bowen--
you're from Miami, Shanika.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.771
- We have Bowen
all the way from China.
- Yep.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.904
How are you gonna guys
gonna incorporate both

10:43.947 --> 10:45.688
of your particular styles
in this one dish

10:45.732 --> 10:47.168
and make something harmonious
and delicious?

10:47.211 --> 10:48.473
He's sweet, I'm spicy,

10:48.517 --> 10:50.519
so we're gonna cook
sweet and spicy.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.477
Bowen:
I'm gonna make
a stuffed chicken breast

10:52.521 --> 10:54.349
with some pork.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.831
Shanika:
We're gonna go ahead and pair
that with a polenta cake.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.963
And then we're gonna go ahead
and do an apple-carrot salad,

11:00.007 --> 11:02.792
doing an Asian twist on it
with some ginger, lemon,

11:02.836 --> 11:04.359
- with, you know, some bacon.
- All right. Good luck.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.926
Thank you.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.928
Joe:
Keep it going,
keep it going.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.799
We wanna, like,
get a nice crust on it.
Don't be afraid.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.975
Right, Joe,
what's the idea behind this?
What are you doing?

11:12.019 --> 11:14.978
So it's a polenta cake
with a little Parmigiano,

11:15.022 --> 11:16.763
and we're gonna do
a chicken Milanese

11:16.806 --> 11:19.983
with an arugula salad
with some pancetta
and tricolor tomatoes.

11:20.027 --> 11:23.204
- What's in there, Ralph?
- Polenta, cream, butter.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.988
Is everything going
according to plan, Ralph?

11:25.032 --> 11:25.989
This is amazing. I mean,
it's turning out perfect.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.905
- Good luck.
- Thank you, thank you.

11:28.949 --> 11:32.430
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Dude, Emily,
I'm so excited right now.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.868
Gordon:
Just under eight minutes to go.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.608
What do you think
about this color I'm getting
on this chicken?

11:36.652 --> 11:38.132
- I love it, I love it.
- Loving it? Loving that color?

11:38.175 --> 11:40.090
- Oh, yeah.
- Gordon: Fascinating.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.180
Cesar and Mark are doing
a stuffed chicken roulade.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.792
But here's the problem:
they're taking the breast
of the chicken,

11:45.835 --> 11:48.664
turning that into a mousse, and
stuffing that inside a thigh.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.535
Aarón:
And a chicken thigh
is hard when it's stuffed

11:50.579 --> 11:52.102
'cause you never know
if it's cooked or not.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.930
- So, I'm gonna do it here.
- Get that meat out.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.367
- Yeah, get that meat out.
- Speaking of roulades,

11:56.411 --> 11:58.979
Bowen and Shanika,
they have a chicken breast

11:59.022 --> 12:01.329
that has pork stuffing,
which potentially could
be undercooked

12:01.372 --> 12:02.896
and the chicken breast
overcooked,

12:02.939 --> 12:04.332
so there's that.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.901
90 seconds remaining.
Speed up, guys.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.903
- I like that sauce.
Good job on the sauce.
- Thanks.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.035
This is gonna be
♪ amazing !

12:12.079 --> 12:14.385
- We gotta get that chicken
on there.
- Go for it.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.910
- I don't think we can slice it.
Look, we have 30 seconds.
- We have to slice it.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.912
- We gotta get the bacon on top.
- Bacon on top of carrots?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.652
- In half.
- No. This way?

12:20.696 --> 12:22.045
The bacon.
Where's the bacon?

12:22.089 --> 12:24.613
- Go, go, go, go.
- At an angle, at an angle.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.615
- Oh, that's what
I'm saying.
- Here, then you go.

12:26.658 --> 12:30.053
- Okay.
- 20 seconds remaining.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.012
Why did you slice it that way?

12:32.055 --> 12:34.014
Taylor and Ashley
are flustered like anything.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.059
- Gordon: Oh, my Lord.
- Look at how this is cut.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.800
- It's the wrong way.
- Okay.

12:37.844 --> 12:41.586
Gordon and Aarón:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

12:41.630 --> 12:44.502
- six, five, four,
- Carrots, bro.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.722
- three, two, one.
- Just throw it on,
just throw it on.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.941
- Gordon: And stop.
- Aarón: That's it.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.944
- [ applause ]
- Gordon: Wow.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.467
Well done!

12:52.510 --> 12:54.817
- Nice.
- Let's go, Joe.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.428
Now it's time to get
even closer to those dishes.

12:57.472 --> 13:01.650
Please, Joe and Ralph,
step forward. Thank you.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.826
Ralph: I'm just so happy
to have made this dish

13:03.870 --> 13:05.915
with my mentor Joe B.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.656
I got so much tips
that somebody

13:07.699 --> 13:09.614
would pay Joe
a lot of money for.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.269
Definitely one of
the best days of my life.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.402
- Gordon: Wow.
- Aarón: Unreal.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.883
That looks delicious.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.189
Ralph, describe
the dish, please.

13:19.233 --> 13:22.453
Ralph:
It's a chicken Milanesa
with a fried polenta cake

13:22.497 --> 13:25.500
and a fresh arugula salad
with pickled veggies,

13:25.543 --> 13:27.415
and a homemade balsamic
vinaigrette.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.200
Ralph, this is a once-
in-a-lifetime experience

13:30.244 --> 13:32.072
- to be working with a man
of Joe's caliber.
- Ralph: Exactly.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.203
What did you learn?

13:33.247 --> 13:34.770
Definitely, number one,
the techniques.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.120
You know,
starting out with the polenta,

13:37.164 --> 13:38.992
how to properly
bread the chicken,

13:39.035 --> 13:42.256
how to spread it, like,
very thin, but also even.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.735
Chicken tastes like
it's confit.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.695
- Yep.
- It's so soft and tender.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.871
And you used the cornmeal
correctly.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.351
You cooked it out
and then caramelized it.

13:50.394 --> 13:53.136
The bacon adds a beautiful
seasoning to the salad.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.921
- Ralph: Exactly.
- And that's what it needed.
It needed some salt,

13:54.964 --> 13:56.879
it needed some love.
And that chicken,
forget about it.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.447
Outstanding job.
Seriously, delicious.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.666
Ralph, the first one
on the balcony. Well done.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.103
- High five, bro.
- Thanks, Joe.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.975
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks, Chef.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.283
Gordon:
Right.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.329
Next, we'd like to taste
Cesar and Mark.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.898
Mark and I
are proud of the work

14:15.942 --> 14:17.987
we put into this dish.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.120
There was teamwork,
there was communication,

14:20.163 --> 14:22.949
and we feel we created
a successful plate.

14:22.992 --> 14:26.953
This teacher-student team is
definitely earning an A tonight.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.609
- Mark, Cesar.
- Yes, Chef.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.046
Describe the dish, please.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.613
Cesar:
So, we have a chicken roulade,

14:35.657 --> 14:37.354
where I took the thigh,

14:37.398 --> 14:39.139
filled it with chicken mousse
made out of the breast.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.706
I put in bell pepper,
jalapeños,

14:41.750 --> 14:43.970
and then the polenta cake.
We folded in bacon

14:44.013 --> 14:46.059
and caramelized onions, and
then we roasted the carrots.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.322
Who conceptualized
this dish?

14:48.365 --> 14:49.932
I did, Chef.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.108
And are you proud
of this dish?

14:52.152 --> 14:54.023
- Yes, Chef.
- Absolutely.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.637
It looks terrible.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.079
Come on, guys.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.298
It's like the size
of a quarter.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.605
It looks sad.
It looks unappetizing.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.129
It's terrible!

15:19.048 --> 15:22.878
Mark, Cesar,
it looks terrible.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.228
It looks sad.
It looks unappetizing,

15:25.272 --> 15:28.884
and it's like the size
of a quarter.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.192
So I've got more polenta
and carrots than I have chicken.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.845
I've got four slices
of chicken,

15:33.889 --> 15:38.676
and I've got raw bell pepper
in a chicken mousse.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.200
It does not make sense.

15:40.243 --> 15:44.291
It's just--
it's really badly executed.

15:48.382 --> 15:52.560
It tastes terrible.
Come on, guys.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.258
The best part
of the chicken
is the thigh,

15:55.302 --> 15:57.173
and the one that needs
all the work is the breast.

15:57.217 --> 16:00.002
But you've pureed the breast
and put it inside a thigh.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.137
The carrots are the most
tastiest thing on there.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.661
I'm underwhelmed,
I'm disappointed,

16:06.704 --> 16:09.881
and you need to step up,
both of you.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.884
- Absolutely.
- Understood, Chef.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.408
I was absolutely confident
in our dish,

16:14.451 --> 16:16.801
but I couldn't have
been more wrong.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.890
I don't know what's up,
I don't know what's down,

16:18.934 --> 16:22.068
but I think I might be facing
my first elimination challenge.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.853
Next up, Julia and S.J.,
please. Let's go.

16:26.855 --> 16:30.076
I'm really proud of the way
that S.J. and I work together,

16:30.119 --> 16:32.861
and I'm really confident
in the dish,

16:32.904 --> 16:35.951
but the judges' expectations
are high.

16:35.995 --> 16:41.043
So I don't know if we did
enough to be safe tonight.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.132
S.J., describe
the dish, please.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.874
So you have a pan-seared
and roasted chicken breast,

16:45.917 --> 16:49.138
baby carrot-pickle salad,
crispy chicken skin
chicharrón,

16:49.182 --> 16:52.272
polenta cake and a white wine
reduction cream sauce.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.838
Who took charge
of that tonight?

16:53.882 --> 16:55.101
Julia definitely did, Chef.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.802
- And who cooked that chicken?
- I did.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.720
Ah, beautiful.

17:07.156 --> 17:11.465
Wow. And delicious.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.641
Seasoning on point,
chicken cooked beautifully,

17:13.684 --> 17:16.861
and the crispy skin
just gives it
that extra texture.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.298
Sauce immaculate,

17:18.341 --> 17:21.127
and the whole thing is just
restaurant quality.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.781
Well done, both of you.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.783
- Thank you so much.
- Gordon: Amazing.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.964
It's really delicious.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.792
The chicharrón is great,
the polenta cake is textbook.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.925
And here's what I love, guys.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.796
You put this really
beautiful smattering

17:38.840 --> 17:41.321
of herbs and garlic
on top of the chicken.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.497
And that right there, friends,
is the difference

17:43.540 --> 17:45.151
between something being good
to being exceptional.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.674
Great job.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.241
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you so much.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.374
[ applause ]

17:51.418 --> 17:54.638
- Good job, guys.
- Joe: Okay, next,
Farhan and Emily.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.125
Tell me about the dish.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.171
Farhan:
So we did an Indian style
chicken and waffles.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.174
Emily spearheaded the chicken
and I helped spice it up.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.784
And I thought of doing
a pakora waffle,

18:09.827 --> 18:11.220
and then we came together
on a slaw.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.617
The chicken's actually
seasoned well.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.619
It's really crispy

18:18.662 --> 18:20.360
and this waffle is
really good,

18:20.403 --> 18:23.189
but there's a tone
of sweetness that
pervades everything.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.408
But it's a great
collaboration.

18:25.452 --> 18:29.195
Gordon:
Next up, Bowen, Shanika.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.544
Describe the dish, please.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.981
Shanika:
We have a pork-stuffed
chicken.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.026
It has
a sweet and spicy sauce,

18:35.070 --> 18:37.420
fried polenta that's cooked
with chicken broth, butter,

18:37.464 --> 18:39.596
and salt and pepper.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.210
The chicken breast is
the toughest one to get right,

18:44.253 --> 18:45.863
and it's dry quickly.

18:45.907 --> 18:50.041
So, putting the pork through
the center is a very smart move.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.434
The polenta is delicious

18:51.478 --> 18:53.219
and that sauce
just lifts it up.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.046
Great job.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.440
Aarón:
Next up, Samantha and Chelsea.

18:57.484 --> 19:01.227
Samantha and I made
a crispy chicken breast

19:01.270 --> 19:02.619
with caramelized onion
cream sauce,

19:02.663 --> 19:04.404
with a Parmesan
polenta cake,

19:04.447 --> 19:06.145
and then carrots
with bacon lardons.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.412
The chicken is
cooked perfectly.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.762
And that onion sauce,
it's beautiful,

19:14.805 --> 19:16.329
it's soft, it's luscious.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.592
It's giving the necessary
richness to the dish.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.246
The texture on
the polenta cake
I'm iffy about,

19:20.289 --> 19:22.596
but the flavor's there.
Good job, ladies.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:24.293 --> 19:27.296
- Whoo!
- Nice work, guys.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.866
Next up, Ryan and Gerron.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.608
I've made fried chicken
numerous of times.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.088
I grew up, five years old
in the kitchen

19:37.132 --> 19:39.003
making fried chicken
with my mom,

19:39.047 --> 19:40.875
and so I'm really feeling
confident about this dish.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.833
Gentlemen,
describe the dish, please.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.618
Ryan:
What we have is

19:44.661 --> 19:46.707
cornmeal-crusted
fried chicken

19:46.750 --> 19:48.404
with dual-colored cabbage,

19:48.448 --> 19:52.365
and also a bourbon, bacon,
and onion jam on the side.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.027
This is crunchy as anything.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.074
It sounds like I'm eating
a bag of freaking chips.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.818
Please don't tell me

20:10.861 --> 20:15.214
that you dredged this chicken
in that whole cornmeal.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.912
That's what I did, Chef.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.265
You can't take cornmeal,
crunchy cornmeal,

20:23.309 --> 20:25.180
and then cook it by frying it.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.269
You gotta grind this first.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.315
I've never known that, Chef.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.404
It's just crunch, crunch,
crunch, crunch, crunch.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.494
However,
it's seasoned on point,

20:34.537 --> 20:37.279
but that is
not your best effort.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.455
Period.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.375
There's some good elements
on this dish.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.464
This jam is actually delicious.
It's super spicy.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.987
Sweet. Love it.

20:50.031 --> 20:53.121
The cabbage is fine,
but, um...

20:53.164 --> 20:56.951
the hero of your dish
is a travesty.

20:56.994 --> 21:00.563
It's too bad, because,
like, two good guys.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.349
Sorry, man.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.743
- I'm not feeling too great.
- It's all good, brother.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.137
It's not the review
that I wanted,

21:09.180 --> 21:11.357
but I should've done something
about that cornmeal

21:11.400 --> 21:13.576
and broken it down.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.318
But, hey, shoulda,
coulda, woulda, right?

21:16.362 --> 21:19.713
Next up, Ashley and Taylor.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.759
- [ sighs ]
- [ applause ]

21:22.803 --> 21:27.895
Our final dish is completely
not what we planned on.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.898
Ashley and I were definitely
not on the same page,

21:30.941 --> 21:34.249
and it is completely coming
through on this plate.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.816
I am just mortified.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.125
Okay, describe
the dish, please.

21:41.169 --> 21:44.172
Ashley:
Pan-seared chicken breast

21:44.215 --> 21:50.004
with sautéed carrots and bacon,
and cornbread cake.

21:50.047 --> 21:53.573
First of all,
I have never ever seen

21:53.616 --> 21:57.359
such a dysfunctional
45 minutes

21:57.403 --> 22:00.928
in the history
of this competition.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.973
- What happened?
- [ exhales ]

22:03.017 --> 22:06.150
Things went wrong quickly.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.717
Honestly,
I didn't really agree

22:07.761 --> 22:10.416
with our concept
in the beginning.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.243
But I asked if we can--

22:12.287 --> 22:13.636
"Are you gonna nail
this cornbread?"

22:13.680 --> 22:16.465
And I trusted Ashley
in nailing a carrot puree,

22:16.509 --> 22:17.771
and she said yes
and we had nothing.

22:17.814 --> 22:20.295
Carrot puree?
Where is that?

22:20.339 --> 22:22.471
It's--
it's not there, Chef.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.952
Why puree baby carrots?

22:24.995 --> 22:26.519
You could eat them
freaking raw.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.522
That was Taylor's idea.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.959
She wanted a carrot puree
at the bottom of the plate.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.440
- Oh, my God.
- That was-- no, we both said
a carrot puree.

22:34.483 --> 22:37.399
- Carrot puree.
- And I said, "Can you nail
that?" And you said yes.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.271
And I said, "Leave some whole
so that we can have
sautéed carrots."

22:40.315 --> 22:41.882
I don't remember
you saying that.

22:47.583 --> 22:51.413
Ashley and Taylor,
why puree baby carrots?

22:51.457 --> 22:54.416
- You could eat them
freaking raw.
- That was Taylor's idea.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.679
She wanted a carrot puree
at the bottom of the plate.

22:56.723 --> 23:00.291
- Oh, my God.
- That was-- no, we both said
a carrot puree.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.250
And I said,
"Can you nail that?"
And you said yes.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.470
And I said,
"Leave some whole."

23:04.513 --> 23:06.515
I don't remember
you saying that.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.476
[ whispers ]
Take responsibility. Damn.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.522
Watching both of you work
is like chewing gum

23:13.566 --> 23:15.698
with a mouth full of nuts.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.875
Two smart, talented girls,
and look at the result.

23:24.315 --> 23:28.929
Salt on point.
But seriously?

23:28.972 --> 23:32.846
The cornbread is dry,
it's crumbly.

23:32.889 --> 23:37.459
And out of all those carrots,
that's what I've got.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.896
And they're bitter.

23:39.940 --> 23:43.465
And the chicken's cut like
freaking elephant toenails.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.685
Who cuts it like that?

23:45.728 --> 23:47.817
I started to cut it,

23:47.861 --> 23:49.863
and then Ashley was like,
"Don't cut it that way."

23:49.906 --> 23:51.604
- So, she cut right into it.
- Oh, my Lord.

23:51.647 --> 23:55.259
So you couldn't even cut
a chicken breast up together.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.739
Nope.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.133
Here's what pains me
more than anything.

23:59.176 --> 24:02.179
What I saw, what I tasted,

24:02.223 --> 24:03.746
and what I believed in
both of you

24:03.790 --> 24:05.661
weeks ago coming
into this competition,

24:05.705 --> 24:08.577
was nothing short
of phenomenal.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.057
But right now,

24:10.100 --> 24:12.363
with these two guys standing
behind me like that,

24:12.407 --> 24:14.801
I look the biggest idiot
in this kitchen.

24:22.548 --> 24:27.770
We both have a Gordon Ramsay
pin on our aprons,

24:27.814 --> 24:30.599
and we have dishonored him.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.949
If he would've
just ripped it off of us,

24:32.993 --> 24:35.604
I don't know
if I could've blamed him.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.394
Tonight, some of you really
embraced this challenge

24:43.438 --> 24:45.484
and shone as a team.

24:47.616 --> 24:51.533
The winning team is...

24:51.577 --> 24:56.103
Julia and S.J.
Well done.

24:56.146 --> 24:59.759
Whoo! I got the best dish
of the night with Julia.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.544
You are safe from elimination.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.329
Please, head up
to the safety of the balcony.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.201
My hunch about Julia
was right.

25:07.244 --> 25:08.985
She is just a great cook,

25:09.029 --> 25:11.248
and I'm just glad that I was
able to work together with her.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.644
Now for the bad news.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.559
Please, all the remaining teams
come down to the front.

25:25.393 --> 25:28.004
- Ashley and Taylor,
- [ whispers ] Oh, my God.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.964
Ryan and Gerron,

25:31.007 --> 25:33.401
Cesar and Mark.

25:33.444 --> 25:37.666
You six are obviously cooking
in the next challenge.

25:38.798 --> 25:41.409
The rest of you are safe.

25:41.452 --> 25:42.584
Head up to the balcony, please.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.935
- Thank God.
- Well done. Great jobs.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.720
I'm going into my first
elimination challenge.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.069
I couldn't be more nervous.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.853
It's very intimidating,

25:50.897 --> 25:53.726
but I absolutely plan
to make Joe proud

25:53.769 --> 25:55.205
and stay in this competition.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.601
Your second and final challenge
of the night

25:59.645 --> 26:02.822
is nothing like your first.

26:02.865 --> 26:06.739
Tonight you'll be
replicating a dish

26:06.782 --> 26:09.829
that strikes fear in the heart
of every home cook,

26:09.872 --> 26:12.309
and a dish that is
just as frightening

26:12.353 --> 26:15.530
for seasoned chefs like us.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.578
It is of course...

26:22.276 --> 26:23.799
...a cheese soufflé.

26:23.843 --> 26:26.933
- Ooh, a soufflé.
- [ whispers ] Oh, my God.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.895
Gordon:
A true wonder
of the culinary world,

26:32.939 --> 26:35.463
crisp on top, and inside?

26:35.506 --> 26:38.553
Soft and creamy
and cheesy.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.469
Look at it.

26:41.512 --> 26:44.690
Every mouthful is a delight.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.127
Mmm.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.781
Nice.

26:48.824 --> 26:52.785
But simplicity
can be misleading.

26:52.828 --> 26:55.657
Tonight, all of you
need to focus

26:55.701 --> 26:59.139
and make us the best soufflé
of your lives.

26:59.182 --> 27:01.358
Elimination is on the line,

27:01.402 --> 27:05.449
and at least one of you
will be going home.

27:05.493 --> 27:08.714
Joe: You'll have 40 minutes
for this challenge.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.280
Within that 40 minutes,

27:10.324 --> 27:14.763
you need to serve us
one perfect soufflé,

27:14.807 --> 27:18.724
and you can serve it
any time you'd like

27:18.767 --> 27:19.986
within that 40 minutes.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.251
Now, if you're smart,
you'll have a strategy.

27:24.294 --> 27:25.861
Think about it.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.734
Three ramekins, two ovens,

27:28.777 --> 27:31.519
one perfect soufflé.

27:31.562 --> 27:34.696
Gordon:
This is not a race tonight,

27:34.740 --> 27:38.744
but you must have a soufflé
on the table behind you

27:38.787 --> 27:41.485
by the time
your 40 minutes is up.

27:41.529 --> 27:46.534
Now, all of you,
head to your stations.

27:46.577 --> 27:49.929
I have never made a soufflé
in my entire life,

27:49.972 --> 27:52.583
and I am terrified

27:52.627 --> 27:53.715
because there's no room
for error.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.586
Aarón:
In front of you,

27:55.630 --> 27:58.502
you all have the same
exact ingredients

27:58.546 --> 28:01.375
to make us a cheese soufflé.

28:01.418 --> 28:05.901
Right.
Your 40 minutes starts...

28:07.773 --> 28:09.513
...now.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.211
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.996
- Stay organized.
- Let's go, y'all.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.346
Right, six talented home cooks
all fighting for their lives.

28:16.390 --> 28:19.306
Right now, this is not
a time to be adventurous.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.874
You need to be focused,
smart, and understand

28:21.917 --> 28:24.659
that soufflés are chemistry.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.749
Gerron:
Make sure that I measure
my butter out correctly.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.664
So, Gordon,
give me some insight

28:29.708 --> 28:31.144
on what the soufflé
is all about.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.537
First of, you make the most
amazing béchamel sauce.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.888
That's your base,
served with butter, flour.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.977
And then you bring the milk up
to a boil.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.196
And you season that,
little bit of onion powder,
garlic powder.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.808
You add that milk to your roux,

28:42.851 --> 28:45.898
and that's the start
of your cheese sauce.

28:45.941 --> 28:48.378
Gordon:
Grated cheese in,
take it off the heat.

28:48.422 --> 28:51.164
If you overcook that roux
with the cheese in there,

28:51.207 --> 28:52.687
the fat starts to seep out,

28:52.731 --> 28:54.776
- Mmm.
- and it's already broken.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.996
Base is working.

28:57.039 --> 29:00.826
Once you've got this beautiful,
light, creamy béchamel
cheese sauce,

29:00.869 --> 29:02.915
let it cool down
and fold in your egg yolks.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.831
You then start whipping
your egg whites.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.920
- Perfect.
- Just under 10 minutes gone.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.923
30 minutes remaining.

29:10.966 --> 29:13.577
- I need--
- Take your time, Ashley.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.449
Stay organized, baby.
Stay organized.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.494
Ashley, how you feeling?

29:17.538 --> 29:20.497
I am feeling strong, Chef.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.978
The first soufflé I ever had
was a cheese soufflé in France,

29:23.022 --> 29:25.676
so I'm, like, channeling
all of these memories.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.504
Have you ever made
a cheese soufflé before?

29:27.548 --> 29:28.941
I've made it one time.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.639
The first time,
I was successful.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.510
I had eight aprons
to give out,

29:33.554 --> 29:35.425
- and you were one of them.
- Yes, Chef.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.863
- I'm expecting big things
from you.
- Absolutely.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.952
- Let's go. Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.826
- Quarter cup, coming up.
- It looks good, Mark!

29:44.870 --> 29:46.436
- Joe: All right, Mark.
- Yes, sir.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.264
You're wearing my apron.
Are you worried?

29:48.308 --> 29:51.050
I'm a little worried just
because I am in the elimination.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.965
- It is my first time.
- Do you make a lot
of soufflés at home?

29:53.008 --> 29:54.488
I'm more of a dessert
soufflé person.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.185
If you can make
a dessert soufflé,

29:56.229 --> 29:58.057
you can make this, right?
Doesn't change that much.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.885
So, three ramekins,
two ovens.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.409
Are you gonna put all three
ramekins in at the same time?

30:02.452 --> 30:04.411
Oh, no way. Absolutely not.
That's too many eggs
in one basket.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.674
I'm gonna go one,
wait a few minutes, maybe two,

30:06.717 --> 30:09.068
and then after
the first one comes out,
I'll have the third in.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.200
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you so much.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.289
Shanika:
You got this, Ryan.
You got this.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.075
All right, Ryan.
How we doing, buddy?

30:16.118 --> 30:17.990
I'm not super confident,
'cause this is a--

30:18.033 --> 30:19.339
a little outta my territory,
but I'm trying.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.080
I'm not psyching
myself out on this.

30:21.123 --> 30:23.082
Those are the people
that go home.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.257
I only had eight
of those aprons

30:24.300 --> 30:25.693
and I trusted you
with one of them.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.130
All right,
counting on you.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.958
Go. Keep going, keep going.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.917
Gordon:
17 minutes to go.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.484
In three minutes from now,

30:34.528 --> 30:37.879
you've got to start putting
soufflés in the oven.

30:37.923 --> 30:41.013
Look. Cesar's cheese,
it looks a little bit broken.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.276
I hope he hasn't
put the cheese in,

30:43.319 --> 30:44.712
- cooked it out on the stove,
- Right.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.235
and the oil's
coming out of it.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.934
- I hope not.
- Joe: It starts to break.

30:48.977 --> 30:52.285
Guys, calm, cool, collected
Ashley's got one in the oven.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.547
Shanika:
All right, Ashley.

30:56.332 --> 30:59.118
I'm really worried
about Taylor.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.337
- Come on.
- The one who's running
behind right now

31:01.381 --> 31:02.948
that I'm seriously
concerned about is Taylor.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.993
S.J.:
Let's go, Taylor. Come on.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.169
Guys, look at Ryan's mix.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.302
It doesn't look like
there's any cheese in there.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.781
It looks like yogurt.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.174
Gordon:
Mark's going in.

31:12.218 --> 31:15.177
- Mark's going in.
- Let's go, Cesar.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.267
- There we go, Gerron, dude.
- Gerron's in. Gerron is in.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.704
Shanika:
You got this, Ryan.
You got this.

31:20.748 --> 31:24.186
Taylor's the only one
with no soufflé in. Wow.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.188
- Taylor. You've got to get
a soufflé in the oven.
- Yes.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.582
Yes, Chef.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.584
- Work faster,
work faster, come on.
- You can do it.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.281
Let's go, Taylor!

31:32.325 --> 31:36.285
Everybody has their soufflés
in the oven but Taylor,

31:36.329 --> 31:39.506
and time is running out,
like, fast.

31:39.549 --> 31:42.074
Doesn't it take 11 minutes
for a soufflé to cook?

31:42.117 --> 31:44.554
She's done.

31:44.598 --> 31:48.123
- Gordon: Taylor,
get one in the oven now.
- I don't have it mixed.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.516
Samantha:
Taylor, just get it in.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.561
Gordon:
11 minutes to go.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.833
Taylor's the only one
with no soufflé in. Wow.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.010
Taylor,
get one in the oven now.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.707
I don't have it mixed.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.058
Gordon:
11 minutes to go.

32:12.104 --> 32:16.151
Taylor, everybody has their
soufflés in the oven but you.

32:16.195 --> 32:19.111
Doesn't it take 11 minutes
for a soufflé to cook?

32:19.154 --> 32:20.460
Let's go, Taylor!

32:20.503 --> 32:22.244
Samantha:
Taylor, just get it in.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.638
Taylor, you better hustle.

32:24.681 --> 32:27.119
Minimum time for cooking
is 11 minutes.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.729
We've got to get them in.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.690
All right, guys,
Taylor's soufflé is finally in

32:33.734 --> 32:35.083
at 10 minutes to go.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.998
[ sighs ]

32:37.042 --> 32:39.044
Joe:
I'm really concerned
about Taylor.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.393
I don't know
what we're gonna taste.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.091
I don't know if Taylor's
is gonna turn out.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.484
Gordon:
So, you can come
back from that.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.139
With 60 seconds left to go,
crank up the heat.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.706
- Joe: But it's a risk.
- Gordon: There is a risk.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.883
You crank up the oven too early
and the soufflé can explode.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.189
It'll actually pop out
of its mold.

32:54.233 --> 32:57.105
The waiting game.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.585
This is the worst part
of soufflé.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.239
Eight minutes to go.

33:00.282 --> 33:03.372
Taylor, what is happening
with you tonight?

33:03.416 --> 33:05.200
- Where's the soufflés?
- I-- they're all in there.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.291
When you put it
at the top of the oven,

33:09.335 --> 33:10.858
- what happens to soufflés?
- It's closer to the heat.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.034
And the top of the soufflé
cooks, underneath is raw.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.427
You haven't got many
choices left now.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.298
- So just be smart.
- Okay.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.039
Okay?
And crank that oven up
when necessary.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.519
Don't go too early.

33:20.694 --> 33:23.479
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- They rising?

33:24.698 --> 33:26.134
Uh-oh! I got a riser.

33:26.178 --> 33:28.136
Gerron, you need
the soufflé

33:28.180 --> 33:29.268
in the middle there
so it cooks evenly.

33:29.311 --> 33:30.443
Which one's
coming out first?

33:30.486 --> 33:32.184
I believe
this one is the one

33:32.227 --> 33:33.228
that's supposed
to be coming out first.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.187
It's kinda tilted
a little bit,

33:35.230 --> 33:36.753
so I'm probably gonna have
to go with the other one, Chef.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.974
You're here for a reason,
because Joe believed in you.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.628
Be decisive. It needs to be
down there before the end.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.064
- Okay, thank you.
- Ralph: Hey, guys,

33:43.108 --> 33:44.457
keep a close eye
on the time, man.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.937
Just be ready to put it out.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.115
Right, young man.
Where we going? Tell me.

33:50.158 --> 33:53.292
This is my first one. So far,
it's taking a rise, so...

33:53.335 --> 33:54.902
Gordon:
What's the paper under there?

33:54.945 --> 33:56.991
- The parchment paper, Chef.
- Why?

33:57.035 --> 33:59.124
I should've taken it off.
I don't know why I didn't.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.864
Sometimes when
that paper blows,

34:00.908 --> 34:02.692
- It might hit the--
- It might hit the soufflé.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.085
Don't touch it now.
Let's just hope
it doesn't blow.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.652
- Okay.
- But you're in there.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.958
- [ sighs ]
- This is freaking torture.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.351
Gordon:
Four minutes remaining.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.136
Oh, my God.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.876
- Aarón: This is intense.
- I can hear the trepidation

34:12.920 --> 34:15.096
in their voice.
They are so nervous.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.577
- Are they up against it?
- They're sticking them
in the top of the oven.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.319
So if they crank up the heat,
it's gonna burn on top

34:20.362 --> 34:22.190
- and it'll be raw underneath.
- Oh, that's a problem.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.671
Gordon:
All of you remember,
when the clock is at zero,

34:24.714 --> 34:27.978
you need to have a soufflé
down in front of us.

34:28.022 --> 34:30.459
Three minutes to go.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.765
[ groans ]

34:31.808 --> 34:34.202
Ashley's opened the oven door.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.204
Soufflé out.
Mark's got one out.

34:36.248 --> 34:39.381
- Look at Mark's.
- Soufflé's going back in.

34:39.425 --> 34:40.904
What's he doing putting it
back in the oven?

34:40.948 --> 34:42.341
- Oh, my--
- What is he doing?

34:42.384 --> 34:43.516
Rule number one,
you don't take a soufflé

34:43.559 --> 34:45.779
out of the oven
and then stick it back in,

34:45.822 --> 34:47.302
- You can't do that.
- because the temperature
difference.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.738
- Yep, absolutely.
- It'll start deflating it.

34:48.782 --> 34:49.826
Don't second-guess,
just choose.

34:49.870 --> 34:52.133
- Just choose.
- Oh, no.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.482
I'm not gonna use this one.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.180
Beautiful, Ashley.
Beautiful.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.703
I'm coming.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.922
- Yes!
- Ashley's coming.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.098
- [ applause ]
- There you go, Ash.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.364
Right. Well done.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.149
There we go, Ryan.
Get that up there.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.194
Wow.

35:10.456 --> 35:11.761
Let's go.

35:11.805 --> 35:15.156
Ashley:
My soufflé looks great,

35:15.200 --> 35:18.377
but does it taste
as good as it looks?

35:18.420 --> 35:21.162
There is no room for error.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.556
It needs to be
perfectly cooked

35:23.599 --> 35:25.427
or I may be going home.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.736
Oh, my God.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.172
I know I'm not down there
cooking,

35:31.216 --> 35:32.434
but I'm sweating like I am.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.567
Everyone down there
is scrambling,

35:34.610 --> 35:36.221
and on top of that,
the judges are tasting

35:36.264 --> 35:38.397
each and every soufflé
as they come out of the oven.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.442
I mean, this is literally
the most insane challenge

35:40.486 --> 35:42.444
I've ever seen before.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.013
Gordon:
One minute to go.

35:46.056 --> 35:48.450
- Keep going, guys! Keep going!
- Good job, guys. Come on.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.191
- Work faster, work faster.
- You can do it.

35:50.235 --> 35:53.890
- Get up there! Go!
- Gordon: 30 seconds to go.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.849
- Joe: Let's go, guys. Come on.
- Gordon: Come on, guys.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.025
- Let's go, Mark. Let's go.
- [ whispers ] I'm just--

35:58.068 --> 36:00.549
- Come on.
- Aarón: Come on, guys.

36:00.593 --> 36:03.030
- Get it up there.
- Gerron!

36:03.073 --> 36:08.296
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,

36:08.340 --> 36:11.343
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- four, three, two, one.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.301
- That's it.
- And stop.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.476
Whoo!

36:20.700 --> 36:22.963
Gordon:
All of you, well done.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.619
Wow, looks good.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.099
I'm so glad
I'm not down there cooking,

36:29.143 --> 36:31.450
because making
a cheese soufflé

36:31.493 --> 36:33.843
was a very difficult challenge
to pull off in 40 minutes,

36:33.887 --> 36:35.845
and no matter who goes home,

36:35.889 --> 36:38.065
we're definitely gonna be
losing someone strong.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.679
Gerron:
It's so quiet that
you can hear a pin drop,

36:43.723 --> 36:46.378
and the judges
are not giving anything away.

36:46.421 --> 36:49.250
Based on their faces,
I cannot tell

36:49.294 --> 36:51.470
whether this is a good dish,
whether it's bad.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.689
This is so intense.

36:53.733 --> 36:57.737
Cesar:
This is my first time
in an elimination challenge,

36:57.780 --> 37:00.261
and, personally, I feel good.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.917
I think, visually,
my cheese soufflé looks great.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.832
I really like
the golden brown color

37:05.875 --> 37:08.138
around the edges of the soufflé,

37:08.182 --> 37:09.923
but tonight could come down
to one mistake

37:09.966 --> 37:11.359
and I'm out the door.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.841
Wow.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.756
That was the toughest,
the most grueling 40 minutes

37:16.799 --> 37:19.933
you've ever experienced
inside this kitchen.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.457
All of you now,
come around to the front,
please. Let's go.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.811
Excuse us.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.382
[ whispers ]
This is really tough.

37:34.426 --> 37:35.949
That was extraordinary.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.472
- That was good.
- Jeez.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.953
So many different factors
that are involved there.

37:39.996 --> 37:43.217
I don't know about mine.
I didn't get a chance
to taste it.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.132
- One was just
egg whites, right?
- Yeah, insufficient cheese.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.438
Like, basically
an egg white omelet.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.354
I hope they like
the taste of mine, man.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.007
- The other one was
undercooked, broken.
- Yeah.

37:51.051 --> 37:53.183
Gordon:
Separated, so it didn't
rise properly.

37:53.227 --> 37:56.970
I think only
one of my corners
was still custardy.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.972
One outstanding one,
by the way, can I just say?
Textbook.

37:59.015 --> 38:01.583
- Absolutely.
- It was cheesy
and creamy and good.

38:01.627 --> 38:04.543
- It was a tough one.
- It was a diff--
definitely a tough one.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.022
- All right, ready?
- Yeah, go, go.

38:14.596 --> 38:18.557
All right, guys, tonight
you all performed admirably,

38:18.600 --> 38:21.386
but we have to say goodbye

38:21.429 --> 38:25.433
to at least one of you.

38:27.435 --> 38:32.440
Now, there was one home cook
that brought us a soufflé

38:32.484 --> 38:34.616
that was clearly head
and shoulders above the rest,

38:34.660 --> 38:38.185
done by one of the home cooks
wearing my apron.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.622
An incredible performance

38:40.666 --> 38:44.626
from a 19-year-old dishwasher.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.411
- Well done, Mark.
- Nice work, Mark.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.369
Good job, buddy.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.197
You are safe.
Head up to the balcony.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.633
Good job!

38:51.677 --> 38:53.853
It was my first elimination
challenge,

38:53.896 --> 38:55.507
and I came out on top.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.770
This is definitely something
that really shows

38:57.813 --> 39:00.338
that I'm worth that investment
Joe put in to me.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.167
Now, there are three home cooks

39:04.211 --> 39:06.300
that didn't quite nail it,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.868
nor did they do so bad

39:08.911 --> 39:10.391
that they have to leave
this evening.

39:10.435 --> 39:13.176
Ashley,

39:13.220 --> 39:15.048
Gerron,

39:15.091 --> 39:16.528
Taylor.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.443
[ whispers ]
Are you kidding me?

39:18.486 --> 39:20.445
Please,
head up to the balcony.

39:26.842 --> 39:29.062
Now for the bad news.

39:29.105 --> 39:33.762
Two home cooks,
both mentored by Aarón.

39:33.806 --> 39:38.027
Cesar, you know your mixture
wasn't perfect.

39:38.071 --> 39:41.770
There's nobody in this room that
can continue making a soufflé

39:41.814 --> 39:45.774
with a broken cheese sauce.

39:45.818 --> 39:49.299
Ryan,
there was excessive egg white

39:49.343 --> 39:52.259
in lumps across your mix.

39:54.261 --> 39:58.439
You both made some fundamental
errors this evening.

40:00.136 --> 40:03.357
When I call your name,
please step forward.

40:07.535 --> 40:09.058
Cesar.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.452
Uh-oh.

40:13.933 --> 40:15.195
Tonight...

40:17.589 --> 40:18.590
you are safe.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.988
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gordon: Head on upstairs.

40:27.990 --> 40:32.604
I'm happy I'm safe,
but I'm not happy with myself.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.736
It's a wake-up call for me.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.564
Just like I tell my students,

40:36.608 --> 40:39.872
I have to make sure
I bring my best effort

40:39.915 --> 40:42.396
every single time.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.703
Ryan, unfortunately,
young man,

40:44.746 --> 40:47.140
your soufflé tonight
tasted more of egg white

40:47.183 --> 40:49.534
than it did
of a cheese soufflé.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.753
That's why you're leaving
this competition.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.278
Aarón:
Ryan, let me tell you,

40:55.322 --> 40:58.891
I saw your spirit,
your unbelievable cool demeanor,

40:58.934 --> 41:00.980
and that's why I chose
to give you one of my aprons.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.982
You've grown
throughout this journey.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.853
Please keep your head up.

41:04.897 --> 41:06.942
You have a beautiful future
ahead of you.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.857
Young man, please,
place your apron

41:08.901 --> 41:10.511
on top of your bench.

41:10.555 --> 41:13.079
- Thank you.
- Hey.

41:13.122 --> 41:14.515
- Much love.
- We'll see you in Houston.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.909
- Love you, Ryan.

41:16.952 --> 41:19.651
Ryan:
Nobody wants to be eliminated,

41:19.694 --> 41:20.695
but it's been a dream ride.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.523
I came into this competition

41:22.567 --> 41:24.438
just a drummer
from Houston, Texas,

41:24.482 --> 41:25.744
but now I know
that I'm more than that.

41:25.787 --> 41:28.181
Love you, bro.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.792
I've played on some
of the greatest stages
in the world,

41:30.836 --> 41:32.577
but I definitely
found my rhythm

41:32.620 --> 41:34.230
in the MasterChef kitchen.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.582
Narrator:
Next time,

41:37.625 --> 41:41.629
the MasterChef restaurant
opens its doors

41:41.673 --> 41:43.762
to the world's toughest
food critics.

41:43.805 --> 41:46.329
- All: I want food!
- So many kids.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.331
Welcome, welcome.
Your table is waiting.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.246
- This is impossible.
- I need steaks over here.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.684
- Let's go, let's go!
- Do you like New York strip?

41:52.727 --> 41:54.599
- Uh, no thanks.
- Oh, dear.

41:54.642 --> 41:57.689
- And a special guest...
- Whoo!

41:57.732 --> 41:59.952
Christina Tosi,
the queen of cakes.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.606
...with the ultimate
challenge.

42:01.649 --> 42:03.477
I don't know
if I made the right decision

42:03.521 --> 42:04.870
investing my apron in you.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.620
You've just taken a bite out of
MasterChef.

42:15.663 --> 42:17.883
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.668
