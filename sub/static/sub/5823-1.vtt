01:45.744 --> 01:49.307
Now we're coming into
the cooling room.

01:49.324 --> 01:51.756
As you can see the upper
three furnaces,

01:51.757 --> 01:54.188
the first one, the second
and the third over there

01:54.209 --> 02:00.479
are constantly in service. The other
furnaces can be fired up when required...

02:02.241 --> 02:06.199
You will have no direct contact
with Herr Hoffmeister,

02:06.267 --> 02:08.351
our director general.

02:08.437 --> 02:12.595
And you are never to disturb him
for any reason whatsoever.

02:12.635 --> 02:16.700
Is that quite clear, Herr Zeitz?
This is his office.

02:28.532 --> 02:31.601
And this is your office.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.237
Friedrich Zeitz, Herr Hoffmeister.

03:10.311 --> 03:13.993
Oh, yes, the new boy...
with the first in engineering.

03:14.009 --> 03:17.791
From Freiburg university.
I majored in metallurgical chemistry.

03:17.885 --> 03:19.710
Is it no rather late for work?

03:19.795 --> 03:25.876
Yes. Though I mean... no.
I have all the time in the world.

03:25.908 --> 03:27.952
Well, I haven't.

03:28.276 --> 03:34.365
Frau Hoffmeister is a stickler for
punctuality, soup is in the plates at 7.30.

03:37.124 --> 03:39.968
I abhore soup.

04:00.147 --> 04:03.159
Hey, Fritz.

04:13.369 --> 04:15.707
You call that a kiss?

04:15.808 --> 04:19.862
- No time, Anna. I'm too busy.
- You're always too busy!

04:19.942 --> 04:23.836
Your washing's dry but
have yet to iron it!

04:25.967 --> 04:29.847
- I'll bring it up with your soup.
- I abhore soup.

04:30.053 --> 04:33.076
- Do you? That's new.
- Yes, it is.

04:36.089 --> 04:41.118
The board was very impressed by your report
on the raw materials to output ratio.

04:41.218 --> 04:45.293
We've decided... I've decided to
widen your responsibilities.

04:45.368 --> 04:51.384
You'll start by supervising the order for
parts for the DÃ¼sseldorf railway bridge.

04:51.672 --> 04:55.223
You'll be very
comfortable in here.

04:57.939 --> 05:04.936
If you need to consult me, don't hesitate.
My door will be always open to you.

05:15.409 --> 05:20.419
- Found it?
- Almost! There's such a mountain of files!

05:20.747 --> 05:25.790
- My father's father started the foundry in...
- In 1835!

05:28.169 --> 05:34.045
Exactly. Then the boom came with
the demand for railway tracks...

05:34.350 --> 05:38.509
For the first main line from
Dresden to Leipzig in 1839.

05:41.119 --> 05:44.525
Is there anything you don't know?

05:45.108 --> 05:49.169
Oh, yes, Herr Hoffmesiter,
I still have much to learn.

06:13.142 --> 06:15.846
Are you all right, sir?

06:15.899 --> 06:18.909
- Shall I call the doctor?
- No.

06:33.860 --> 06:39.707
I have... a quite serious
health condition.

06:42.014 --> 06:47.784
But nobody here at the plant
must know of it. Nobody.

07:22.666 --> 07:27.008
Friedrich Zeitz, Herr Hoffmeister
is expecting me.

07:42.005 --> 07:46.865
My doctor has confined me to
the house until further notice.

07:46.938 --> 07:50.614
I can partly run the steelworks
by telephone so...

07:52.021 --> 07:54.795
I've decided to give
you a new job.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.902
- Me?
- Yes.

07:59.187 --> 08:03.247
I want you to report to me
here once a day to discuss

08:03.300 --> 08:08.344
current business and then to relay
my instructions back to the works.

08:08.632 --> 08:10.633
What do you say?

08:24.531 --> 08:26.603
Stop here, please.

08:45.726 --> 08:49.207
The manufacture of 328 girders
should be subject to a 40% deposit,

08:49.208 --> 08:52.688
not 33%, as mistakenly
states in the contract.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.688
Incidentally, Herr Hoffmeister.

08:54.862 --> 08:57.769
For six days this furnace has been
out of line. The hairline crack

08:57.770 --> 09:00.676
in the reservoir must be between
the sixth and the seventh.

09:00.862 --> 09:04.676
That's why this furnace and this one here
are still not operational.

09:05.094 --> 09:07.751
Could you please type out two copies
of the engineer's meeting?

09:07.969 --> 09:10.272
Herr Hoffmeister wishes to
add his own notes before

09:10.273 --> 09:12.713
distributing it to the factory.
I'll take a copy from my desk.

09:14.455 --> 09:16.899
...it follows that
renovating the foundry

09:16.900 --> 09:19.344
will cut budget costs and double
the output to 12 tons per year...

09:19.434 --> 09:22.753
Thank you.
That's enough for today.

09:24.477 --> 09:25.939
Come on.

09:27.997 --> 09:29.987
Herr Zeitz?

09:30.873 --> 09:33.528
I'm Frau Hoffmeister.

09:34.249 --> 09:36.492
Herr Hoffmeister's wife?

09:36.513 --> 09:40.226
Of course.
I'm not his mother.

09:42.578 --> 09:46.135
So we meet at last. My husband
has told me a lot about you.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.651
I was just about to take some tea.
Would you like to join me?

09:49.717 --> 09:54.872
It's very kind of you but...
I'm already late. Another time, perhaps.

09:56.015 --> 09:58.841
Goodbye, Herr Hoff...
Frau Hoffmeister.

10:12.969 --> 10:16.862
Music means more to me
than anything in the world.

10:17.003 --> 10:20.611
Except my husband
and son of course.

10:24.860 --> 10:28.772
Oh, no, thank you.

10:39.654 --> 10:41.339
Milk?

10:42.085 --> 10:43.434
Thank you.

10:44.969 --> 10:48.113
Yes, thank you or no, thank you?

10:48.980 --> 10:51.839
Yes, no, it's perfect.

11:08.990 --> 11:13.088
Somebody once said, I can't
remember who, that so...

11:13.171 --> 11:19.436
that music can exist without the wolrd
but the world cannot exist without music.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.766
I believe it was Goethe.

11:24.926 --> 11:30.022
Yes. So you enjoy
literature then, Herr Zeitz.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.840
To be honest I mostly
read science books.

11:34.991 --> 11:37.341
Tea is really very nice.

11:37.412 --> 11:42.503
- Have you never tasted tea before?
- No, it's the first time.

11:43.648 --> 11:47.514
Well, enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.

11:48.041 --> 11:53.798
- I'm afraid, there's nothing to tell.
- No, surely you must have a family.

11:53.885 --> 11:57.384
I never knew my father. My mother
died when I was very young.

11:57.473 --> 12:01.574
- But who brought you up?
- I was a ward of state.

12:02.102 --> 12:05.186
Well, you certainly did
brilliantly at school.

12:05.242 --> 12:09.347
I had to, it was my only hope,
literally my only hope.

12:16.853 --> 12:21.684
- Have you found somewhere nice to live?
- Very nice, thank you.

12:22.667 --> 12:27.839
My husband commissioned it. I hated sitting
for it, I think it shows, doesn't it?

12:32.804 --> 12:36.859
- That's a very pretty...
- Isn't it beautiful?

12:37.289 --> 12:40.008
I saw it in a shop window
and fell in love with it.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.925
My husband thinks it's ghastly.

12:46.102 --> 12:51.214
- More tea? - No. Thank you.
I should be getting back to the office.

12:51.355 --> 12:55.000
Yes, of course. What time is it?
Otto will be home soon.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.380
Otto, he's our son.
You haven't met him yet?

12:58.448 --> 12:59.750
No.

13:00.666 --> 13:04.846
He is... he is a very
bouncy, very happy boy,

13:04.946 --> 13:08.729
but he doesn't really
apply himself in school.

13:09.591 --> 13:11.430
It occurs to me...

13:15.654 --> 13:17.717
I did some tutoring
when I was a student.

13:18.070 --> 13:22.083
If you like I could give your
son some extra lessons.

13:22.132 --> 13:27.231
- Would... would you have time for that?
- I could make time.

13:28.022 --> 13:33.099
No. Don't let me disturb you,
I left my newspaper somewhere.

13:33.463 --> 13:37.724
- So how do you find our young friend?
- You'll never guess what he just offered.

13:37.789 --> 13:39.092
I've no idea.

13:39.117 --> 13:43.195
- He's offered to give Otto extra lessons.
- Well!

13:44.000 --> 13:47.812
You soon have the whole
family under your wing.

13:52.890 --> 13:56.179
It's easy. Come on, try.

14:01.593 --> 14:06.853
See? You've got it in you.
Now, let's practise your French.

14:06.954 --> 14:11.474
- French is a beautiful language.
- No, it's not. Mother makes me learn it.

14:11.549 --> 14:13.573
But I hate it.

14:13.662 --> 14:16.537
Try reading me this fable.

14:18.071 --> 14:20.074
The Wolf and the Dog.

14:20.075 --> 14:23.575
A prowling wolf, whose shaggy skin
Hid little but his bones,

14:23.576 --> 14:27.076
So strict the watch
of dogs had been

14:27.077 --> 14:32.477
Once met a mastiff dog astray.

14:32.478 --> 14:37.378
A prouder, fatter, sleeker Tray,

14:37.379 --> 14:40.779
Sir Wolf in famish'd
plight, Would fain have

14:40.780 --> 14:44.179
made a ration upon
his fat relation

14:44.180 --> 14:47.480
But then he first must fight;

14:47.481 --> 14:50.031
And well the dog seem'd able

14:50.032 --> 14:52.581
To save from wolfish table
his carcass snug and tight.

14:52.582 --> 14:56.632
So, then, in civil conversation

14:56.633 --> 15:00.682
The wolf express'd his
admiration of Tray's fine case.

15:00.683 --> 15:08.683
Said Tray, politely,
'Yourself, good sir, may be as sightly;

15:20.177 --> 15:22.230
A penny for your thoughts, Fritzi?

15:23.580 --> 15:25.257
Stop calling me that.

15:25.352 --> 15:28.169
If you say so, Fritzi.

15:30.987 --> 15:32.375
Not now.

15:32.461 --> 15:34.184
Why not?

15:34.258 --> 15:37.855
I've got an important job
to finish for tomorrow.

15:37.899 --> 15:41.821
- Are you sure there's no other reason?
- No, like what?

15:41.837 --> 15:45.474
Like what? Like who?

15:45.745 --> 15:48.882
Like what? Like who?

15:49.860 --> 15:51.691
Like what?

16:13.631 --> 16:16.862
I think we should buy
Otto that train.

16:16.898 --> 16:19.867
Karl, please, it would make
him so happy!

16:20.120 --> 16:22.606
I told him he must
wait until christmas.

16:22.649 --> 16:26.710
I know but he got such
good marks in his exams.

16:27.179 --> 16:29.396
Thanks to our friend here.

16:29.484 --> 16:32.237
- Hm?
- Hmm.

16:34.364 --> 16:38.176
How expensive is this
train set, anyway?

16:47.546 --> 16:49.728
- Very well!
- Good.

16:49.808 --> 16:53.472
I leave you two to get
on with your work.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.524
How can one resist?

17:20.222 --> 17:24.035
I bet you can't play trains and recite
fourth declension nouns at the same time.

17:24.098 --> 17:26.098
Dominus, domina, domino...

17:26.099 --> 17:27.500
Dominum.

17:27.601 --> 17:30.201
Dominum, domini, domino.

17:30.202 --> 17:33.802
Domini, dominii, domina, dominis,
dominorum, domines.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.331
Very good. Again.

17:36.613 --> 17:41.314
Singular. Dominus, domina,
dominum, domini, domino.

17:41.419 --> 17:46.321
Plural. Dominii, dominii, dominos,
dominorum, domines.

17:46.522 --> 17:50.922
Singular. Dominus, domina,
dominum, domini, domino.

17:50.923 --> 17:55.323
Plural. Dominii, domini, dominos,
dominorum, domines.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.124
Singular.
Dominus, domina...

18:08.374 --> 18:10.752
Here, this is for you.

18:10.851 --> 18:12.600
What is it?

18:13.509 --> 18:17.577
It's to say thank you for
your kind work with Otto.

18:23.659 --> 18:25.689
I can't accept it.

18:27.186 --> 18:30.777
No, but you must.
"The laborer is worthy of his hire."

18:30.843 --> 18:34.561
You don't understand.
I don't want money from you.

18:56.323 --> 18:57.381
Wait!

18:58.481 --> 19:01.290
I was tactless earlier today.

19:01.352 --> 19:05.119
- I do hope that
I didn't offened you. - No.

19:05.232 --> 19:06.418
Here.

19:07.993 --> 19:12.082
By way of an apology I'd hoped that you
would stay to dinner with us sometime.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.507
Even... even this evening.
If you're free.

19:14.581 --> 19:18.208
I'm terribly sorry,
I have an engagement.

19:36.748 --> 19:39.726
As Germans we know our
industrial strength.

19:39.842 --> 19:42.173
- But you know what our weakness is?
- I'm sure you are going to tell me.

19:42.209 --> 19:46.238
Raw materials. That's what we lack.
Take your steelworks. Every year

19:46.324 --> 19:49.341
one-third of its budget gets
spent a manganese ore.

19:49.441 --> 19:53.266
- And the price keeps going up as you know.
- Can't we just use less manganese?

19:53.275 --> 19:57.949
- Out of the question. It's a key ingredient in metal alloys.
- So what are you getting at?

19:58.001 --> 20:00.157
What I'm getting at...

20:00.880 --> 20:02.949
...is highly confidential.

20:03.056 --> 20:07.145
Vast deposits of manganese have
been discovered in Mexico.

20:07.454 --> 20:11.636
Enough to keep your steelworks
running for decades.

20:12.142 --> 20:15.705
It's highly confidential but
you know about it?

20:15.795 --> 20:16.829
Yes.

20:16.912 --> 20:21.203
A fellow student from Freiburg, now
working at Veracruz, tipped me the wink.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.727
And we've got to get
in there first.

20:23.748 --> 20:28.635
Form a consortium, buy up the land,
secure the mining rights, dig up that ore.

20:28.672 --> 20:31.815
We're a long way from Mexico.

20:32.405 --> 20:36.597
This is the 20th century. The age
of speed and new horizons,

20:36.628 --> 20:40.354
the world is ours for the
asking, all we have to...

20:45.288 --> 20:47.361
Just a second.

21:16.275 --> 21:21.361
Always find it strangely moving
when she plays this piece of music.

21:31.289 --> 21:34.771
It's very affecting.
Don't you think?

21:36.259 --> 21:37.637
Yes.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.996
You were saying?

21:54.994 --> 21:58.015
I do find it very affecting.

21:59.323 --> 22:01.538
No, about Mexico.

22:02.853 --> 22:06.695
I'm sorry... I was saying.

22:11.401 --> 22:14.921
We must take this
golden opportunity.

22:15.338 --> 22:18.883
Why would Mexico bring in
a German steelmaker

22:18.891 --> 22:22.508
when they have Americans
on their doorstep?

22:29.045 --> 22:30.532
Why?

22:33.056 --> 22:34.582
Because...

22:37.465 --> 22:41.364
You know this revolution
they've just had Pancho Villa, Zapata?

22:41.997 --> 22:44.885
Yes, it's been in the papers.

22:44.943 --> 22:49.191
Well, German military advisers
played a crucial role.

23:12.598 --> 23:13.742
Yes?

23:17.074 --> 23:21.652
The Mexican leadership wants to
blunt North-America's influence

23:21.708 --> 23:26.876
by attracting investment from
Europe. The door is wide open.

23:31.787 --> 23:35.622
How much would we have
to invest to get started?

23:50.427 --> 23:51.427
Hello.

23:59.236 --> 24:00.625
Yes, ma'am?

24:01.968 --> 24:05.033
Does Herr Friedrich Zeitz
live here?

24:05.053 --> 24:08.682
- He's out at work!
- Yes, I know, I was just er...

24:08.765 --> 24:13.843
- I was wondering if I could see his apartment?
- His apartment?

24:13.968 --> 24:16.366
It's up there, top floor!

24:16.441 --> 24:17.952
Who are you?

24:17.969 --> 24:19.641
Nobody!

24:20.376 --> 24:22.114
The landlady!

24:22.407 --> 24:28.277
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
I had no idea! Top floor, room 14.

24:28.316 --> 24:33.359
- I'll see you up. - Oh, no,
don't bother, just give me the key.

24:34.866 --> 24:38.500
- Should I give him a message?
- Yes. Don't tell him I was here.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.956
Private secretary?

26:35.646 --> 26:39.658
- I'm not sure I am up to the job...
- Of course you are. You're young

26:39.758 --> 26:42.790
but you have all
the right qualities.

26:42.812 --> 26:46.806
Who else do we have to thank for
our new venture in Mexico?

26:48.172 --> 26:51.803
Herr Hoffmeister, I can't tell
you how honoured I am

26:51.903 --> 26:56.534
by the trust of you. - I've one small
condition to ask but it needn't detain us.

26:56.573 --> 27:01.583
It would be better if you left your
present lodgings and moved in here.

27:02.232 --> 27:06.154
Isn't it a bit more convenient
in every respect?

27:08.145 --> 27:11.871
- I take your point but...
- What's putting you off

27:11.971 --> 27:17.085
the thought of moving in here, you'll be
better off here than up in your garret.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.388
Did I tell you I lived in a garret?

27:20.763 --> 27:22.858
Yes.

27:24.159 --> 27:25.159
Didn't you?

27:27.038 --> 27:28.702
Oh, Herr Zeitz!

27:32.518 --> 27:37.092
My... my husband's told me what he
had asked and I understand that you...

27:37.163 --> 27:40.375
...that you have some reservations.
Can I ask you what they are?

27:40.457 --> 27:44.185
- I've been given board and lodging by
employers in the past and... - Oh, but...

27:44.203 --> 27:47.768
Well, my husband is not offering
you a servant's position.

27:48.145 --> 27:49.369
I...

27:50.299 --> 27:52.050
...cherish my independence.

27:52.107 --> 27:55.862
Of course. I can well understand
how important that is.

27:56.208 --> 28:01.749
For a young man to be independent.
Is that your... your only reason?

28:01.814 --> 28:05.845
Speaking for myself I will do
everything that I can to make your stay

28:05.899 --> 28:08.906
as comfortable as possible.
- Thank you, I'm sure but...

28:08.977 --> 28:11.877
Oh, no, thank you for accepting.

28:11.950 --> 28:15.998
We'll expect you tomorrow, I'll send
Hans to bring your belongings.

28:32.241 --> 28:35.895
I can't not going,
my job depends on it.

28:40.452 --> 28:44.175
I'll come back here as soon
as I can, I promise.

28:44.637 --> 28:45.782
Don't...

28:46.873 --> 28:48.118
Please.

28:51.467 --> 28:52.614
Not now.

30:31.178 --> 30:36.280
As you can see there's enough room
for everyone to feel comfortable.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.020
Those are the servants' stairs.

30:52.229 --> 30:53.229
No.

30:53.375 --> 30:55.223
Your room is here.

30:59.297 --> 31:02.276
And ours is just down the hall.

31:07.642 --> 31:11.325
So please, tell me if you're not
completely comfortable.

31:11.486 --> 31:15.033
Your my husband's assistant
and I'm his wife.

31:15.125 --> 31:18.126
- Let's agree to be frank with each other.
- Agreed.

31:18.294 --> 31:21.561
Dinner's at 7.30., my husband's
a stickler for punctuality,

31:21.661 --> 31:25.331
he likes his soup served on the dot.
- Yes, Frau Hoffmeister.

31:25.419 --> 31:28.908
Hah, Charlotte, though
people call me Lotte.

32:36.856 --> 32:40.856
- Is your room adequate?
- Impeccable. Thank you, sir.

32:44.599 --> 32:49.293
- Pleasant autumn we're having.
- Yes. A blaze of colour.

32:50.676 --> 32:54.078
Oh, I'm so sorry I was late.
I was with Otto.

32:54.479 --> 32:57.793
You haven't met?
Let me introduce you.

32:57.804 --> 33:01.037
Herr Zeitz, my Husband, Karl.
Karl, Herr Zeitz.

33:05.803 --> 33:09.166
...and it rears at every single jump.

33:09.581 --> 33:13.090
So eventually I asked the riding
master for a quieter horse.

33:13.094 --> 33:16.221
And he says to me:
Madam, a horse is like a mirror.

33:16.259 --> 33:21.785
It reflects everything
you fear or dare to do,

33:21.823 --> 33:27.346
so if your horse refuses a fence it is
you who are not ready for it. - Huh!

33:27.457 --> 33:31.554
It sounds like that Viennese doctor
that claims he can read your thoughts

33:31.654 --> 33:35.746
by listening to your dreams. What's his
name again? - As if you didn't know.

33:35.763 --> 33:39.768
And my husband loves
to play the village idiot.

33:44.258 --> 33:45.968
I'm turning in.

33:50.564 --> 33:52.424
See you shortly, my dear.

33:54.665 --> 33:56.195
And you tomorrow.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.580
Yes sir. See you tomorrow.

34:03.643 --> 34:06.394
Thank you, Magda,
you can leave it.

34:06.445 --> 34:11.534
My husband never eats dessert. And
always retires to bad at a quarter to nine.

34:11.937 --> 34:15.998
- Every night?
- Yes. Except for New Year's Eve.

34:17.409 --> 34:21.243
I knew nothing of life
before I met Karl.

34:22.427 --> 34:27.489
I was engaged to be married to a childhood
friend in the town that I grew up.

34:27.911 --> 34:31.777
But he died in a mountaineering
accident and...

34:32.018 --> 34:35.579
Karl was a friend of my parents'.

34:36.424 --> 34:41.476
He... er... He helped me through the
ordeal, gave me a shoulder to cry on.

34:42.018 --> 34:45.083
Why are you telling me this?

34:46.563 --> 34:49.918
Well, because I presume
that you're surprised

34:50.018 --> 34:53.601
that my husband is not younger.
No... no.

35:01.302 --> 35:02.884
Here.

35:17.974 --> 35:19.205
Sorry.

35:26.662 --> 35:29.210
What do you think of it?

35:29.499 --> 35:32.658
Let's say it's a fine
portrait of you.

35:33.642 --> 35:36.074
But... unfaithful.

35:37.884 --> 35:39.128
Unfaithful?

35:39.143 --> 35:42.596
Yes, it's...
It's like a mask, it's...

35:42.615 --> 35:44.445
...smooth and...

35:44.947 --> 35:48.487
...superficial and shows
nothing of who you are.

35:48.923 --> 35:50.277
Deep down.

35:51.365 --> 35:56.314
- Time for bed, I think, don't you?
- Uh... No, I'll...

35:56.738 --> 36:01.794
...stay down here awhile...
...try and do some more of your puzzle.

36:01.884 --> 36:06.650
- You'll find your own way to your room?
- Yes, Frau Hoffmeister. - Lotte.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.084
Good night, Friedrich.

36:09.104 --> 36:12.071
Good night. Lotte.

37:49.643 --> 37:52.545
...by replacing this third
furnace here...

38:07.418 --> 38:12.245
...we will most likely be able to extract
similar minerals such as copper and nickel,

38:12.372 --> 38:17.092
and reasonably expect a return
of around 115 % in the first year...

38:24.917 --> 38:28.706
- Is Madame Lotte at home?
- I don't know, Sir.

38:34.947 --> 38:37.997
Holland: Amsterdam.
Greece: Athens.

38:38.014 --> 38:41.075
Serbia: Belgrade.
Switzerland: Bern.

38:41.140 --> 38:44.752
Belgium: Brussels.
Denmark: Copenhagen.

38:44.834 --> 38:47.915
Finland: Helsinki.
Portugal: Lisbon.

38:48.005 --> 38:50.092
England: London.

38:53.093 --> 38:58.158
Father wouldn't let me learn the piano.
He made me learn fencing instead.

38:58.190 --> 39:01.437
He said it'd be more use
to me when I grow up.

39:01.799 --> 39:03.042
What for?

39:03.129 --> 39:07.917
For fighting duels with people who
dishonour my wife. Or my mother.

39:08.605 --> 39:11.782
Oh! A rat! A mouse!

39:11.970 --> 39:14.258
It just ran under there...

39:14.259 --> 39:15.493
Where is it?

39:15.494 --> 39:16.727
It's a horrible thing
with a big fat face.

39:16.728 --> 39:17.789
I see it, I see it!

39:17.961 --> 39:20.126
Quick! It's up...

39:20.291 --> 39:21.650
No, Otto!

39:21.717 --> 39:22.717
Don't!

39:47.425 --> 39:48.479
Thank you!

39:48.480 --> 39:52.620
The bankers in Frankfurt are
interested in the project.

39:53.353 --> 39:56.913
They're waiting to see
our investment plan.

40:00.199 --> 40:03.075
What will you do with your sunday?

40:03.197 --> 40:04.250
I don't know.

40:04.866 --> 40:10.120
Probably go to the cafÃ©, play a few
rounds of billiards with some friends.

40:10.381 --> 40:11.637
Chase the girls?

40:11.676 --> 40:12.747
Ah!

40:14.816 --> 40:18.416
- Do you have a sweetheart?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

40:18.523 --> 40:23.919
Ah, a secret fiancÃ©e.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.863
So I'll see you at lunch then.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.281
Frau Hoffmeister.

40:34.739 --> 40:38.274
She wouldn't miss the 10 o'clock
service if the world was on fire.

40:38.304 --> 40:42.908
- Don't you accompany her?
- No time for all that humbug.

40:46.972 --> 40:52.897
But if you enjoy church
don't let me stop you.

40:53.301 --> 40:56.495
Me? No. No, no, thank you.

41:00.229 --> 41:03.508
Only the passion that
touches its abyss

41:03.608 --> 41:06.634
can light the tinder of
your utmost truth.

41:06.728 --> 41:12.083
Only to him who loses his
whole self will self be given.

41:12.914 --> 41:14.614
Blaze that.

41:14.615 --> 41:20.409
For only by catching fire will you learn
to know the world deep inside you.

41:20.509 --> 41:25.203
Only where mistery
works does life begin.

41:35.373 --> 41:37.261
Please, be seated.

41:48.895 --> 41:51.505
One, two, three, freeze.

41:54.082 --> 41:57.533
Back to the start.
Yes, I saw you.

42:00.580 --> 42:03.462
One, two, three... freeze.

42:05.508 --> 42:08.241
One, two, three, freeze.

42:10.417 --> 42:14.050
- Back to the start again.
- No, no, no. I'm here.

42:15.884 --> 42:18.175
One, two, three...

42:18.176 --> 42:20.319
I won, I won!

42:21.975 --> 42:23.354
I get to give you a dare.

42:23.785 --> 42:25.301
You cheated!

42:27.607 --> 42:28.720
What?

42:30.453 --> 42:32.336
Oh, Otto!

42:32.418 --> 42:38.075
No, I didn't. I didn't cheat. Oh, no,
don't give me that grumpy face. Smile.

42:38.119 --> 42:41.433
I didn't cheat, did I, Friedrich?

42:42.170 --> 42:43.865
You're not cheating.

42:52.917 --> 42:54.327
Stop.

44:31.275 --> 44:32.475
Enough!

44:37.996 --> 44:39.742
So will you, please?

44:39.885 --> 44:42.875
Really... I can't, I have
too much work to do.

44:42.918 --> 44:46.493
- Well, even on the sunday?
- Even on the sunday.

44:46.673 --> 44:49.618
Don't you ever go to church?

44:54.513 --> 44:58.250
My husband can't stand any
noise of any kind anymore.

44:58.324 --> 45:02.043
He even gets cross
when I play the piano.

45:02.833 --> 45:06.979
I can't keep Otto cooped
up in this monastery.

45:09.455 --> 45:13.112
He'll be very upset
if you don't come.

45:24.702 --> 45:25.702
Otto!

45:43.564 --> 45:44.575
Come.

45:47.856 --> 45:51.211
What a lovely boy.
Just like his parents.

45:53.105 --> 45:55.026
Hey man, come in here,
look at these potatoes!

46:03.477 --> 46:06.887
- I do like your scent.
- Thank you.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.881
What is it?

46:12.389 --> 46:15.268
Young man, don't you know better
than to ask a lady her scent?

46:17.063 --> 46:19.909
No, I'm afraid, I didn't.

46:20.322 --> 46:23.619
But if I don't ask
how can I find out?

46:24.327 --> 46:27.390
It's L'Heure Blueue, by Guerlain.

46:29.306 --> 46:31.104
It suits you so well.

46:32.305 --> 46:35.002
I'm not sure Guerlain may have
made it especially for you.

46:35.105 --> 46:39.009
Ready, smile! And!

46:46.514 --> 46:48.536
Otto! Where is he?

46:49.431 --> 46:50.609
Otto!

46:51.363 --> 46:52.127
Otto!

46:52.288 --> 46:53.288
Otto!

46:53.578 --> 46:54.578
Otto!

46:56.843 --> 46:57.843
Otto!

46:57.968 --> 46:58.968
Otto!

46:59.316 --> 46:59.916
Otto!

47:00.077 --> 47:01.077
Otto!

47:02.780 --> 47:03.780
Otto!

47:04.962 --> 47:06.042
Otto!

47:16.594 --> 47:20.405
I would hate to
appeare indiscreet...

47:21.341 --> 47:24.647
...but my husband has told me...
- Yes?

47:24.937 --> 47:28.112
...that you have a...
...a friend in town, a...

47:28.417 --> 47:29.935
...lady friend.

47:30.113 --> 47:33.150
I didn't expect him
to tell you about it.

47:33.207 --> 47:36.691
Oh, we tell each other
everything, it's only natural.

47:36.967 --> 47:39.197
Oh, I assure you
that's all I know I...

47:39.279 --> 47:43.426
Especially since I understand that
it's a secret affair.

47:44.208 --> 47:45.319
Yes, it is.

47:46.717 --> 47:50.291
It's very romantic idea,
a secret love affair.

47:50.715 --> 47:52.218
Like a novel.

47:53.810 --> 47:57.263
How gentlemanly of you not
to disclose her name.

47:58.951 --> 48:01.903
One day I'll tell you who she is.

49:39.424 --> 49:41.090
Stop. Stop.

49:46.415 --> 49:49.271
- So you're top dog now, are you?
- Don't be silly.

49:50.169 --> 49:54.042
I asked the man on the gate and he
said you'd taken over from the boss.

49:54.096 --> 49:56.629
I'm only his private secretary.

49:56.730 --> 49:59.887
- What about the car?
- He lets me use it.

49:59.949 --> 50:01.958
What about his wife?

50:06.416 --> 50:09.871
You forgot this lot.
Washed and ironed.

50:10.009 --> 50:11.389
Thank you.

50:12.924 --> 50:16.160
You promised to come back
and see me, you remember?

50:16.165 --> 50:18.766
Sorry, I haven't had time.

50:21.707 --> 50:25.327
There's a young couple living
in your old room now.

50:25.441 --> 50:29.716
They're going to have a baby.
They're going to be happy together.

50:30.041 --> 50:32.367
Anna, I've got to go.

50:33.105 --> 50:36.179
You did that a long time ago.

50:37.276 --> 50:38.510
Carry on!

50:39.354 --> 50:40.426
Go on then!

50:40.539 --> 50:43.690
Go back to your mistress!

50:56.761 --> 50:59.460
Anyone would think
it was made for you.

51:00.695 --> 51:04.786
- I'll lend you a top hat too.
- Is that really necessary, sir?

51:05.163 --> 51:06.638
Indispensable.

51:07.666 --> 51:09.314
In that case, thank you.

51:09.471 --> 51:13.116
No, I thank you for relieving me
of these dreary obligations,

51:13.117 --> 51:17.219
a Sunday in the country
and then an evening in town

51:17.220 --> 51:19.865
listening to some fat woman
take forever to die.

53:16.372 --> 53:19.077
- I prefer to walk back.
- As you wish.

53:19.124 --> 53:20.178
Alone.

53:21.108 --> 53:22.187
Why?

53:22.371 --> 53:23.821
Because...

53:24.657 --> 53:26.503
You know very well.

53:26.512 --> 53:29.491
No, I don't. Please, tell me.

53:29.638 --> 53:32.464
Because we can't keep doing this.

53:32.520 --> 53:33.648
Doing what?

53:35.082 --> 53:37.357
Lying to each other.

53:37.793 --> 53:39.874
Lying to each other?

53:41.906 --> 53:45.451
What on earth are you
imagining, Herr Zeitz?

53:46.001 --> 53:50.278
Who do you think you are?
And what do you think I am?

54:15.371 --> 54:16.712
Help! Help!

54:17.386 --> 54:19.011
Come! Quickly!

54:23.015 --> 54:25.642
Don't just stand there!
Help me!

54:25.783 --> 54:28.670
Let's try and get him to sit up.

54:32.657 --> 54:34.393
It's another seizure.
Karl, can you hear me?

54:34.747 --> 54:37.118
Listen to me! Yes?

54:42.871 --> 54:44.246
I'm going to call Doctor Meyer.

54:46.121 --> 54:47.311
I'll give you one of
those injections.

54:47.519 --> 54:48.560
I don't need that.

54:50.228 --> 54:52.244
I feel better already.

54:57.073 --> 54:58.073
Right.

55:03.356 --> 55:08.408
Now. Tell me all about it.

55:11.665 --> 55:12.665
About what?

55:15.752 --> 55:17.390
Your night at the opera.

55:23.590 --> 55:24.760
Thank you, Doctor.

55:44.196 --> 55:45.854
It was a serious heart attack.

55:47.072 --> 55:52.129
The doctor says he might not
recover unless he keeps lying in bed.

55:58.098 --> 56:01.319
It was fortunate that you
were there last night.

56:01.419 --> 56:04.525
If my husband hadn't survived I...

56:06.229 --> 56:09.742
Dread to think what would
have become of us.

56:19.133 --> 56:22.199
The new machine is being
installed but it can't be

56:22.200 --> 56:28.165
brought on stream until it's been run
in for months. - Never mind about that.

56:28.641 --> 56:31.725
Friedrich, all our hard
work is paid off.

56:33.009 --> 56:36.904
Tomorrow the bankers sign up
for our Mexico venture.

56:39.404 --> 56:43.108
- I had no idea.
- No? I wonder that surprise you.

56:44.445 --> 56:48.162
The wheels will be turning
fast from now on.

56:48.604 --> 56:53.172
I shall need a man on the spot
to oversee the money operations.

56:53.185 --> 56:56.636
- On the spot in Mexico?
- Where else?

56:57.148 --> 57:00.050
And you're the man for the job.

57:00.265 --> 57:01.274
What?

57:03.795 --> 57:04.588
Me?

57:04.664 --> 57:07.796
I want you out there
as soon as possible.

57:07.818 --> 57:09.106
Why me?

57:09.592 --> 57:13.260
The whole idea of this wonderful
scheme was yours, wasn't it?

57:13.319 --> 57:18.661
Just think, travelling halfway across
the world, building and running

57:18.662 --> 57:23.123
a mining town, exploring the
depth of the earth.

57:23.124 --> 57:26.919
What a prospect, what
a life for a young man.

57:28.087 --> 57:32.211
So should I take this proposal
as a... kind of exile?

57:34.315 --> 57:35.959
Exile from what?

57:42.734 --> 57:43.734
Alright.

57:45.440 --> 57:48.538
If you want me to go I'll...

57:48.539 --> 57:49.813
I'll go.

57:50.533 --> 57:53.835
If you have any personal
reasons that I'm not aware of

57:53.935 --> 57:57.648
that prevent you or
deter you from going...

57:59.597 --> 58:02.715
...I shan't force you into it.

58:06.261 --> 58:08.713
No, sir, there's nothing.

58:09.533 --> 58:10.848
And no one.

59:09.562 --> 59:13.243
The dinner's on the table.
Aren't you coming down?

59:14.478 --> 59:16.508
Are you unwell?

59:17.792 --> 59:20.356
Hasn't your husband told you?

59:20.419 --> 59:21.882
What?

59:23.257 --> 59:26.697
That I'm to go to
Mexico for two years.

59:27.070 --> 59:29.881
For two years?

59:29.882 --> 59:32.444
No... You... You... You can't!

59:33.354 --> 59:36.787
No, you can't!
You can't! You can't!

59:49.928 --> 59:52.702
When do you need to leave?

59:53.903 --> 59:55.663
Ten days.

59:57.181 --> 01:00:01.110
No. Please, don't...
Don't... I... I...

01:00:02.979 --> 01:00:05.549
I can't live without you.

01:00:09.193 --> 01:00:11.670
Why didn't you tell me?

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.459
Tell you what? You already knew.

01:00:22.694 --> 01:00:25.558
No. Not here, no.

01:00:26.132 --> 01:00:27.162
Not now.

01:00:29.507 --> 01:00:31.100
Mother! Mother?

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:01.936
No. You mustn't.

01:02:02.773 --> 01:02:05.945
Not here, not now.
Please, I told you.

01:02:06.132 --> 01:02:07.132
No!

01:02:10.031 --> 01:02:11.284
When then?

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.441
- When you return.
- In two years? - Yes.

01:02:16.446 --> 01:02:20.496
- Will you still want me in two years?
- Will you still want me?

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:24.102
We'll make a...

01:02:25.496 --> 01:02:27.656
A vow to each other.

01:02:28.195 --> 01:02:31.232
A promise to love each other.
Do you see?

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:32.292
No.

01:02:32.353 --> 01:02:33.879
Friedrich!

01:02:34.194 --> 01:02:35.177
Friedrich!

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.740
Where the devil are you?

01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:45.094
I was just arranging some flowers.
And one of those horrible creatures

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:48.556
from the garden came in.
You know, one of those...

01:02:48.602 --> 01:02:51.864
...fury ones. It knocked
over the vase.

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.089
I was frightened, I screamed.

01:02:54.143 --> 01:02:56.833
Friedrich came to my rescue
and chased it out the window.

01:02:57.799 --> 01:02:59.966
Everything's fine now.

01:03:06.861 --> 01:03:09.067
Come along, Friedrich,
I need you too.

01:03:09.173 --> 01:03:12.330
No, no darling. Otto has
been waiting for his lesson.

01:03:31.736 --> 01:03:35.524
- Will you see cowboys and indians?
- No, Mexico isn't America.

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:39.448
But it's a huge big country
too with lots of deserts.

01:03:39.508 --> 01:03:42.648
- Will you carry a gun?
- Well, definitely.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:46.517
- How long will it take you to get there?
- Just over three weeks.

01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:51.571
So, we sail from Hamburg, here, down
the coast of England and France.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:57.455
Spain, Portugal and all the way
across the Atlantic to Brazil.

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:06.029
Venezuela, and finally dock here in
Mexico in a port called Tampico.

01:04:06.347 --> 01:04:09.241
Will you send me stamps
for my collection?

01:04:09.332 --> 01:04:12.886
That's enough now, Otto,
it's time to supper.

01:04:13.285 --> 01:04:16.686
Will you come back
here afterwards?

01:04:19.848 --> 01:04:24.203
Yes. I promise I'll
come back here.

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:44.690
There.

01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:46.958
It's finished.

01:04:48.241 --> 01:04:51.049
Now what do we do with it?

01:04:54.218 --> 01:04:55.437
Break it up.

01:05:50.839 --> 01:05:52.762
Stop. Stop! St...

01:05:52.938 --> 01:05:53.956
Stop.

01:05:59.991 --> 01:06:01.020
Stop.

01:06:45.664 --> 01:06:47.852
Come closer to me.

01:06:49.243 --> 01:06:52.856
It's ridiculous this great
table separating us.

01:06:53.664 --> 01:06:56.259
Soon it'll be an ocean.

01:06:57.554 --> 01:07:01.172
Why don't we try and
be happy this evening?

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:03.368
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:07:05.259 --> 01:07:07.955
Here's to your last night.

01:07:08.228 --> 01:07:09.967
Our last night.

01:07:14.124 --> 01:07:17.718
I may, mayn't I?

01:07:19.946 --> 01:07:21.990
For our last night.

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:28.657
I'm going to make
a suggestion and I want you

01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:31.404
to think very carefully
before you answer me.

01:07:31.419 --> 01:07:33.511
Now what if you...

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:42.778
- May I clear the table, ma'am?
- Yes, of course.

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:43.988
Thank you.

01:07:45.222 --> 01:07:47.102
It was delicious.

01:07:56.701 --> 01:08:00.539
What if you come away with me?
With your son, of course.

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:07.261
- You must be...
- Think... carefully... please.

01:08:10.067 --> 01:08:12.384
You must be dreaming.

01:08:16.656 --> 01:08:19.091
Then I shall stay here.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:26.051
If you stay here
we'll be found out.

01:08:28.796 --> 01:08:33.889
I want to say goodbye to Friedrich
before he leaves tomorrow.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:38.444
At the crack of dawn
for what I hear.

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:41.385
Yes, sir. Five o'clock.

01:08:41.794 --> 01:08:46.122
Let's make the most of these
last few moments together.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:56.750
I wanted to thank you for
making this immense sacrifice...

01:08:58.296 --> 01:09:02.594
...for leaving your homeland and
your loved ones behind you.

01:09:09.886 --> 01:09:13.428
Karl, do you really
think you should...?

01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:22.631
Why deny oneself a pleasure
while one is still alive?

01:10:18.295 --> 01:10:23.137
<i>My secret love. Your letters
take so long to get here</i>

01:10:23.138 --> 01:10:27.078
<i>that I can't bear to wait for
the next one before I write.</i>

01:10:27.575 --> 01:10:30.971
Hello, I've... I've come for some
letters for Frau Verlage.

01:10:31.035 --> 01:10:34.023
They should be transatlantic
mail from Mexico.

01:10:34.154 --> 01:10:36.107
I'll check for you.

01:10:48.509 --> 01:10:53.784
<i>We are still only at the prospecting stage
and I cover vast distances on horseback.</i>

01:10:53.826 --> 01:10:58.133
<i>I have had to learn to ride,
shoot, make a campfire.</i>

01:10:58.233 --> 01:11:02.315
<i>I dull my mind with work
to try and numb my yearning for you.</i>

01:11:02.855 --> 01:11:07.543
<i>But the evenings by
the campfire, tired as I am</i>

01:11:08.377 --> 01:11:13.980
<i>I write to you envying the sheet of
paper which will soon be in your hands.</i>

01:11:13.987 --> 01:11:16.046
<i>Pressed to your breast...</i>

01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:18.769
<i>...perhaps even to your lips.</i>

01:11:19.386 --> 01:11:20.598
<i>My beloved,</i>

01:11:20.698 --> 01:11:24.244
<i>I can think of nothing but
you from morning till night.</i>

01:11:24.283 --> 01:11:26.358
<i>Especially at night.</i>

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.300
<i>If only you knew how
much I miss you,</i>

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.154
<i>no sooner was our love disclosed
than we had to say goodbye.</i>

01:11:36.386 --> 01:11:39.511
<i>The moment I saw the
train take you away</i>

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:42.873
<i>I knew that your absence
would be unendurable.</i>

01:11:42.936 --> 01:11:44.367
<i>But do not worry.</i>

01:11:44.416 --> 01:11:48.244
<i>This is our pact and I will stand
the test with fortitude.</i>

01:11:49.168 --> 01:11:52.607
<i>We're aparted by distance,
but also by time.</i>

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.560
<i>Little by little the past feels more
and more like a foreign country.</i>

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:05.670
<i>Your letters are all that I have
to keep it alive inside me.</i>

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:08.647
<i>I too preserve your
letters like treasure.</i>

01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:11.197
<i>But yesterday I had quite a fright.</i>

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:15.227
<i>Otto showed me a Mexican stamp which
he said his father had given him.</i>

01:12:15.306 --> 01:12:18.592
Look at the stamp
that father gave me.

01:12:19.621 --> 01:12:23.147
<i>I was terrified that Karl might
have found your letters.</i>

01:12:29.448 --> 01:12:32.665
I had a letter from Friedrich.

01:12:37.215 --> 01:12:41.213
Poor boy had bad luck.
Caught some kind of fever.

01:12:43.699 --> 01:12:45.959
Seems he almost died.

01:13:01.887 --> 01:13:03.318
Ma'am! Ma'am!

01:13:03.384 --> 01:13:04.897
Are you all right?

01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:08.018
Let me help you.
Are you all right?

01:13:25.946 --> 01:13:27.484
"Dear Herr Hoffmeister,

01:13:27.508 --> 01:13:32.035
Everything is going well here.
I shall be back in six months.

01:13:32.042 --> 01:13:37.087
In the meantime I wish you a happy
and prosperous year for 1914

01:13:37.173 --> 01:13:40.807
to you, your gracious
wife and young Otto.

01:13:40.868 --> 01:13:44.360
Respectfully yours, Friedrich Zeitz."

01:13:45.406 --> 01:13:49.113
Father, may I keep this
stamp for my collection?

01:14:04.855 --> 01:14:06.541
Hans, what does that bell mean?

01:14:06.855 --> 01:14:09.982
It means we are at war, ma'am.

01:14:18.634 --> 01:14:23.178
"After stabilizing all fronts our
glorious army has retaken

01:14:23.278 --> 01:14:27.258
the initiative."
"This time in the East."

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:30.522
<i>How I wish this war would end.</i>

01:14:31.322 --> 01:14:34.978
<i>I don't care whether we win
or lose as long as it is over.</i>

01:14:35.592 --> 01:14:39.413
<i>I no longer even know when
I can hope for your return.</i>

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:45.895
<i>This may be my last letter or the
last you will receive for some time.</i>

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.334
<i>We have heard there is
to be a naval blockade.</i>

01:14:50.557 --> 01:14:53.606
<i>I feel like a man
under house arrest.</i>

01:14:53.631 --> 01:14:57.079
<i>Cut off from my country
and the woman I love,</i>

01:14:57.507 --> 01:15:00.546
<i>by an ocean of steel and fire.</i>

01:15:05.348 --> 01:15:07.805
Returned to sender, ma'am.

01:15:10.933 --> 01:15:12.042
Why?

01:15:12.906 --> 01:15:15.656
Well because of the
war, I suppose.

01:15:15.809 --> 01:15:18.344
Is there a war in Mexico?

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.508
I wouldn't know, ma'am.

01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:33.735
My husband wondered whether
you've heard anything from Fr...

01:15:33.822 --> 01:15:35.291
From Herr Zeitz?

01:15:35.372 --> 01:15:38.591
I'm afraid we've lost
touch with him, madam.

01:15:38.687 --> 01:15:39.755
How so?

01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:43.876
Didn't Herr Hoffmesiter tell you?

01:15:43.923 --> 01:15:48.431
All see trafic between Europe
and South America has stopped.

01:15:49.586 --> 01:15:51.763
No ships, no mail.

01:15:53.695 --> 01:15:57.639
Can't somebody cable him
just to see if he's all right?

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.438
I'm sure he is all right.

01:16:01.428 --> 01:16:03.438
There's no war there.

01:16:07.295 --> 01:16:11.481
Tell your husband not to
fret, Frau Hoffmeister.

01:16:19.493 --> 01:16:21.452
I can't... I can't breathe!

01:16:25.858 --> 01:16:28.112
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.818
Sssh.

01:16:31.395 --> 01:16:32.295
It's all right. It's all right.

01:16:32.584 --> 01:16:33.824
It's all right. It's all right.

01:16:34.014 --> 01:16:42.014
Sssh.

01:16:42.984 --> 01:16:44.821
It's all right.

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:51.162
Sssh.

01:16:51.163 --> 01:16:54.546
It's all right. It's all right.

01:17:10.049 --> 01:17:13.208
<i>Still these letters which
you will never read.</i>

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.795
<i>The steelworks have been requisitioned
to make artillery guns.</i>

01:17:19.171 --> 01:17:22.949
<i>No word from you, but
I keep on writing you.</i>

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:29.169
<i>Karl tried to object. They threw him out
and put an army officer in charge.</i>

01:17:30.414 --> 01:17:34.325
<i>As a result my poor husband
has fallen ill again.</i>

01:17:35.226 --> 01:17:39.542
<i>I am frightened, I've got
nothing to hold on to.</i>

01:17:40.224 --> 01:17:44.109
<i>The world of yesterday, the
world I knew, is vanishing.</i>

01:17:45.031 --> 01:17:48.183
<i>And I can't endure the present.</i>

01:17:56.592 --> 01:18:00.916
<i>On his last day, Karl told
me a stupendous secret.</i>

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:11.102
I wanted to bring you together
from the very beginning.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.884
But then I felt such pain.

01:18:16.938 --> 01:18:22.482
I could see that you loved him
more than you ever loved me.

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:31.005
He took possession of you
and dispossessed me.

01:18:41.108 --> 01:18:46.695
How could I have kept
you from loving him?

01:19:44.903 --> 01:19:50.231
<i>I told Otto it was for his sake. That
he'd be safer in a boarding school.</i>

01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:54.561
<i>But in my heart of hearts
I felt I was abandoning him.</i>

01:19:54.661 --> 01:19:58.371
<i>Just as I feel abandoned
myself now that I'm alone.</i>

01:19:59.505 --> 01:20:01.777
<i>With no one left to love.</i>

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:11.366
<i>I remember those lines from the
poem I read you one evening.</i>

01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.927
<i>The week before you left.</i>

01:20:14.233 --> 01:20:19.717
<i>"In the old, cold, lonely park
two ghosts recalled the past."</i>

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.813
<i>And you answered at once.</i>

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:28.692
<i>"Why take refuge in the past
when we can revel in the present."</i>

01:20:28.881 --> 01:20:30.423
Please, ma'am.

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:33.963
Don't sit there in the dark.

01:20:46.793 --> 01:20:50.607
<i>For six years now
we've been apart.</i>

01:20:51.028 --> 01:20:54.757
<i>And for four of them I haven't
heard a word from you.</i>

01:20:55.919 --> 01:20:58.595
<i>Not a single sign of life.</i>

01:20:58.828 --> 01:21:04.280
<i>And yet I am certain
you are still out there.</i>

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:11.879
<i>Somewhere alive. I still think
about you all the time.</i>

01:21:13.014 --> 01:21:18.090
<i>The only thing that keeps me
alive is the memory of our love.</i>

01:21:18.215 --> 01:21:21.737
<i>It is for our love
that I am in mourning.</i>

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:36.392
<i>Your skin, my skin, our union.</i>

01:21:50.553 --> 01:21:52.090
Ma'am?

01:21:54.191 --> 01:21:55.727
Ma'am!

01:21:57.422 --> 01:21:59.884
We have lost the war.

01:22:01.664 --> 01:22:03.343
We've lost what?

01:22:03.372 --> 01:22:07.906
Germany has lost the war.

01:22:36.104 --> 01:22:37.471
Hallo.

01:23:05.446 --> 01:23:07.904
Yes. Tomorrow.

01:23:09.716 --> 01:23:10.779
Yes.

01:24:28.733 --> 01:24:30.352
Herr secretary!

01:24:32.555 --> 01:24:33.994
Hello, Hans.

01:24:40.063 --> 01:24:41.643
Thank you, Hans.

01:24:41.718 --> 01:24:44.290
What a pleasure to come back
here after all these years.

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:46.862
Yes, Herr secretary.

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:49.204
All these years.

01:25:02.031 --> 01:25:05.191
Hello, Friedrich, welcome back.

01:25:06.241 --> 01:25:09.260
I hope I haven't been too long.

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:14.217
I'm back in Germany on business.
I took the chance to look you up.

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:18.120
It's very nice of you.
Are you settled in Mexico now?

01:25:18.135 --> 01:25:21.058
By necessity, more than choice.

01:25:21.105 --> 01:25:25.659
- You're still in the mining business?
- Oh, no. No. I used my knowledge

01:25:25.759 --> 01:25:28.480
of chemistry to start
a chemical fertilizer plant.

01:25:28.538 --> 01:25:31.103
I'm pleased you've done
so well for yourself.

01:25:31.132 --> 01:25:34.684
Do you intend to stay
in Germany for long?

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.726
I'm not sure it depends on...

01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:41.260
...how my business goes I've
come over to sign contracts

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.360
with the company in Frankfurt.

01:25:46.506 --> 01:25:50.020
I had no news of you.
Your letters stopped coming.

01:25:50.249 --> 01:25:51.539
So did yours.

01:25:51.604 --> 01:25:55.176
So eventually I stopped
writing them.

01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:01.898
I wrote you a letter just
after the armistice.

01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:06.801
Must have gone astray.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:13.233
A riding accident. I would have
been unfit to serve the war.

01:26:14.307 --> 01:26:17.781
In any case we were
kept under house arrest.

01:26:18.854 --> 01:26:22.132
Did you want to serve?

01:26:22.694 --> 01:26:25.128
I felt a sense of guilt...

01:26:25.352 --> 01:26:30.353
...by thinking of all the boys my
age who had to... go off and fight.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:36.401
When the blockade began I tried to get
out, I was desperate to get back to...

01:26:37.978 --> 01:26:40.058
To my home country.

01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:49.641
Is that Otto?

01:26:50.077 --> 01:26:51.161
Yes.

01:26:51.447 --> 01:26:52.877
He's 19 now.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:58.878
Starting in geography, his dream
is to explore the polar regions.

01:26:59.163 --> 01:27:00.715
What about you?

01:27:01.886 --> 01:27:03.346
What's your dream?

01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:05.986
Oh, I don't have any dreams.

01:27:06.009 --> 01:27:09.513
I'm alive.
The wolrd is at peace.

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:13.112
Yes. It is.

01:27:15.655 --> 01:27:19.184
I couldn't quite finish it,
there was a piece missing.

01:27:19.227 --> 01:27:21.690
No, there isn't. Look.

01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:24.763
They're all here.

01:27:31.459 --> 01:27:33.386
Where did you find it?

01:27:34.029 --> 01:27:35.029
Here.

01:27:35.914 --> 01:27:38.601
It's been here all the time.

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:41.529
I sold it.

01:27:41.788 --> 01:27:43.951
You never liked it anyway.

01:27:43.999 --> 01:27:48.388
- The portrait of Herr Hoffmeister's wife.
- Now, his widow.

01:27:48.725 --> 01:27:50.139
Yes, I know.

01:27:51.156 --> 01:27:52.561
I'm sorry.

01:27:53.881 --> 01:27:56.844
I never got married myself.
I've been with women but...

01:27:56.850 --> 01:28:00.665
Well, of course. Far be it from me
to reproach you on that front.

01:28:02.114 --> 01:28:04.871
- More tea?
- No, thank you.

01:28:04.959 --> 01:28:08.861
- I should be getting back to my hotel.
- So soon?

01:28:08.959 --> 01:28:12.540
- I have a business meeting.
- Oh, I completely understand.

01:28:12.574 --> 01:28:16.899
- Well, thank you for taking the trouble to visit...
- Could I ask you just one favour?

01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:18.001
Yes.

01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:26.832
Might I have a look at my old bedroom?
It's... It's silly, I know.

01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:31.552
...how sentimental one
becomes with age.

01:28:39.569 --> 01:28:42.670
I must warn you that your
room is exactly the same.

01:28:42.712 --> 01:28:46.595
- Nothing has changed.
- Not even you.

01:28:58.303 --> 01:29:01.013
See? Nothing has changed.

01:29:02.032 --> 01:29:04.454
Everything's the same.

01:29:06.176 --> 01:29:08.619
No, nothing has changed.

01:29:13.150 --> 01:29:15.264
Except us.

01:29:21.458 --> 01:29:25.251
I haven't forgotten
my promise to you.

01:29:41.551 --> 01:29:43.590
We're nearly there.

01:29:44.553 --> 01:29:47.693
It took us a long
time to get here.

01:30:35.975 --> 01:30:37.672
Any chance for room?

01:30:37.793 --> 01:30:42.002
- Er... No, no. We're booked solid.
- You too? What's going on in this town?

01:30:42.098 --> 01:30:44.611
Well, it's the parade.
The war veterans.

01:30:44.612 --> 01:30:47.125
They've booked every
single room in the town.

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.077
A war wound?

01:30:52.728 --> 01:30:55.603
So you're here for the parade?

01:30:55.612 --> 01:30:57.612
Yes. Yes, we are.

01:30:58.692 --> 01:30:59.855
Well there...

01:30:59.956 --> 01:31:03.588
Then you are in luck. We have a...
An unexpected vacancy.

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:06.794
- Er... And that's Herr...
- Zeitz.

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:09.609
Herr and Frau Zeitz?

01:31:09.692 --> 01:31:12.637
Yes. Herr and Frau Zeitz.

01:31:15.299 --> 01:31:18.089
Is this your first stay
in town, sir?

01:31:18.197 --> 01:31:23.534
No. We were here once. Before.

01:31:24.931 --> 01:31:25.970
Before.

01:31:26.227 --> 01:31:28.461
Yes, indeed, ma'am.

01:31:55.923 --> 01:31:58.347
Shall we go for a walk?

01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:01.266
Yes.

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:39.263
We walked down this very same
path with Otto. You remember?

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.361
Yes. He kept running
on ahead and we'd almost

01:32:42.362 --> 01:32:45.363
lost him for the umpteenth time.

01:32:46.158 --> 01:32:49.240
I kept calling him to come back.

01:32:49.555 --> 01:32:53.262
But actually I just wanted
to be alone with you.

01:32:55.992 --> 01:32:58.532
We were stargers then.

01:32:59.501 --> 01:33:00.765
As now.

01:33:54.618 --> 01:33:57.292
Don't ever leave me again.

01:33:57.777 --> 01:34:00.354
Don't ever leave me.

01:34:01.056 --> 01:34:06.148
I never ever leave
you from now on.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:14.227
It took us a long
time to get here.
