WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:06.924
Pootie Shoe News Dump.

00:09.218 --> 00:13.555
Cuties, dudies, this is Pootie.

00:14.890 --> 00:18.769
I know you're wondering why I have
not been streaming Mythic Quest today.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.896
Before we get into it,
I just want to say that

00:20.979 --> 00:22.689
I've been playing this game
since I was a kid,

00:22.773 --> 00:27.819
and it's really always going to occupy
a very special place inside my heart.

00:27.903 --> 00:31.990
That said, Mythic Quest
just isn't showing me the love anymore,

00:32.073 --> 00:33.784
so I think it's time for a change.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.120
-Oh, jeez. Oh, crackers.
-As sad as it is for me to say this...

00:38.539 --> 00:44.044
I will no longer be streaming
Mythic Quest... ever again.

00:45.838 --> 00:49.049
Now, fear not, Pootie Nation,
I do have something new in the works.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.759
Something new and fresh.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.679
I hope you guys are gonna
take that journey with me.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.598
Pootie out!

00:58.809 --> 00:59.768
Oh, fuck.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.084
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.377
You're looking at this wrong.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.088
Pootie drove a ton of traffic,
but we had no control over him.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.673
If we get the right streamer to play MQ,

01:29.756 --> 01:31.842
then we're in charge of
the messenger and the message.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.094
And all we have to do is
debase ourselves to children?

01:34.178 --> 01:37.306
-It's a brave new world, my friend.
-Yeah, I guess so.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.185
There are still some diehards out there
who play for the right reasons.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.561
Look at this, the Masked Man!

01:42.644 --> 01:44.730
Hello, little boy. I love your costume.

01:44.813 --> 01:45.939
Hi.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.274
I'm not a little boy.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.445
I'm... I'm-- Hold on.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.447
-Poppy.
-No. Hold on.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.032
I'm doing a big reveal.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.784
Okay, can someone--
There's like a little clippy thing.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.494
-Yeah.
-Can you just-- Oh, my God.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.330
-Okay, get it off. Can you get it off?
-Yeah, yeah.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.624
I'm really claustrophobic!
Is it on the right side?

02:03.707 --> 02:05.334
Pop, relax! Just relax!

02:05.417 --> 02:07.294
-Get the clip off!
-We got you. Take a breath.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.630
Hey!

02:11.673 --> 02:14.218
-What are you doing?
-Sorry to crash your little boys' club,

02:14.301 --> 02:16.470
but I'm a department head

02:16.553 --> 02:18.639
and I should be included
in big decisions like this.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.556
Come on.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.975
Navigating different personalities,
making gut-check calls about people...

02:22.059 --> 02:24.102
I don't know if those instincts
are part of your skill set, Pop.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.604
I have great instincts.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.814
Right, like wearing full cosplay
to a not-cosplay event.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.942
And what's with the tester?

02:30.025 --> 02:32.194
You're bringing the whole company?
Guys, we look desperate.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.155
I brought Dana because she gets it.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.324
She's young, she's a woman in gaming,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.451
and, unlike you,
I actually value the voice of--

02:39.535 --> 02:41.662
-Poppy needed a ride, right?
-Yeah.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.248
I tried to warn her about the cosplay
thing, but then she yelled at me.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.542
Okay, that is enough of your voice, Dana!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.253
Go... explore.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.295
Okay. Bye.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.421
-Bye, Dana.
-Bye, Dana.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.381
Have fun.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.428
Ian's gone, so it is officially "D-Day."

02:58.929 --> 02:59.930
David Day.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.558
Today, we can do whatever we want, Jo.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.854
Yeah, when the bosses are away,
the little mouse will play.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.690
Aren't you the boss?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.861
Well, yeah, yeah, but, you know.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.447
Do you call yourself "a little mouse"?

03:18.323 --> 03:21.827
Sometimes. Someone has to be the mouse,
otherwise the expression doesn't--

03:21.910 --> 03:22.911
You know what, Jo?

03:22.995 --> 03:27.875
One of the things I don't wanna have to do
today is explain myself to you. Okay?

03:27.958 --> 03:31.336
David, do you think maybe I'd be more
useful assisting Ian at the StreamerCon?

03:31.420 --> 03:33.005
If I leave now,
I could probably beat traffic.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.007
Jo. Jo. Okay.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.093
Let's just clear this up once and for all.
You're my assistant.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.512
You live to serve only me
and my every whim.

03:40.596 --> 03:44.057
You will speak when spoken to. And--

03:46.810 --> 03:48.228
-Yeah?
-Hey, David, man,

03:48.312 --> 03:51.273
there's a bunch of girls out front here
from Girls Can Code.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.233
They say they're scheduled for a tour?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.194
Oh, shit, is that today?

03:55.277 --> 03:56.653
-Not just your average...
-That one.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.238
Hey, look at this.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.489
Where my ladies at?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.034
-Hi! How you doing?
-Hello. Come on over.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.660
My name is David Brittlesbee.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.537
-Hi. Mr. Brittlesbee.
-I'm executive producer.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.415
Let me just say, I am so excited
that you girls are all here.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.293
You know, and you picked
the right gaming company because,

04:11.376 --> 04:15.339
let me tell you something,
we value women here at Mythic Quest.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.009
In fact, our head programmer
is a woman. Poppy Li.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.011
And she is in charge of
programming the entire game.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.012
Cool!

04:22.095 --> 04:23.972
Yeah. And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,

04:24.056 --> 04:26.099
you're gonna have to work pretty hard
to get where she's at

04:26.183 --> 04:27.768
if you wanna be where she's at.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.811
But I'll let her tell you all about that.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.855
-Who wants to see a woman who can code?
-Me!

04:31.939 --> 04:34.399
Who wants to see the best engineer
you could ever find?

04:34.483 --> 04:35.400
Yeah!

04:35.484 --> 04:37.694
-Okay, then let's go meet Poppy!
-She's not here.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.155
-What?
-She's not here.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.782
She went to StreamerCon.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.494
Why didn't you tell me?

04:45.577 --> 04:47.663
Because I only speak when spoken to, sir.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.917
Are there any other female coders
we can meet?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.211
Yes. Obviously. Yes.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.257
We have plenty of women who work here
in various positions.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.722
No. Not in this room. But in other rooms.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.224
Because we are filled with women.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.767
Jo! Jo's a woman.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.227
-Right? Jo?
-Yeah.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.187
So why don't you tell the girls
what you do?

05:12.271 --> 05:15.774
Sure. I live only to serve a man,
and that man is David.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.151
Okay. She's normally not like this, okay?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.695
Yeah, she usually won't listen
to a word I say.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.364
But she's only acting like that
due to disciplinary action

05:22.447 --> 05:24.032
resulting from weeks
of insubordination, so...

05:26.535 --> 05:28.328
You know what? It doesn't matter. Yeah.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.705
Poppy will return.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.790
In the meantime,
let's go meet some ladies!

05:31.874 --> 05:32.708
Yes!

05:32.791 --> 05:36.086
Come on. Again, not in this room.
We're gonna skip on past this one.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.849
Yo. What's up, C.W.?

05:50.142 --> 05:53.729
Apologies. I was lost in my ennui.

05:54.897 --> 05:59.484
Ian's absence leaves me wandering
the halls, feeling a bit unmoored.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.821
-Yeah, I know what you mean.
-I've never been in here.

06:02.905 --> 06:07.659
We work at the same place, yet we exist
in two completely different worlds.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.453
Not surprising, I suppose.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.830
I'm old, you're young.
I'm a man, you're a boy.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.916
What? I'm a woman.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.250
Are you?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.754
-I'll take your word for it.
-Thanks.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.173
So what do you do, exactly?

06:22.341 --> 06:23.592
For real, dude?

06:23.675 --> 06:25.677
I test the game for bugs and shit

06:25.761 --> 06:27.763
so that when people like you play,
it actually works.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.016
-I've never played.
-Wait, you've never played the game?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.852
I deal in story and emotion, not games.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.896
Dude, when a game is as good as this one,

06:35.979 --> 06:38.398
playing it is just as emotional
an experience as some story.

06:40.150 --> 06:45.197
You can't tell me that gameplay has more
emotional resonance than a good cutscene.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.574
Cutscenes are boring, man. I skip them.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.160
Oh, no. No, no!

06:50.744 --> 06:54.414
Let me show you the power of a story,
my dear boy.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.334
Girl.

06:58.085 --> 07:02.881
Okay, fine. But first, I'm gonna show you
the power of the game, old man.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.424
Grab a controller.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.053
Wow. Okay, that's a mouse.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.305
So we're just gonna
start from the beginning.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.561
So now I just frag the battle cruiser.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.021
Mission cleared. That's so sick.

07:18.814 --> 07:22.150
This campaign has everything
that I love about Cold Alliance 2.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.778
It's got killer missions,
snap-tight controls,

07:24.862 --> 07:28.657
and the sickest graphics
of any MMORPG out there.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.076
He's already playing our rival game?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.495
I guess the piece of shit
floated downstream.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.872
And I know I just started playing,

07:34.955 --> 07:39.418
but so far I'm inclined to give this game
four and a half B-holes.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.712
What? He shot them
straight up to four and a half?

07:41.795 --> 07:42.796
And a half?

07:42.880 --> 07:44.715
That doesn't make any sense!
What's a half a butthole?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.050
-And then why not just give ten, right?
-I don't know.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.635
-Why not give 20?
-Yeah.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.847
A million buttholes!
A million buttholes for all!

07:51.930 --> 07:53.891
Nah, it's just business.
They clearly made him a great offer.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.853
I can't believe that companies
are straight-up paying kids these days.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.397
Like, why aren't gamers losing their shit?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.149
Okay, come on. Don't be naive. All right?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.735
Even fans know streamers
make these arrangements.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.153
And make no mistake about it,

08:06.236 --> 08:08.655
we're gonna have to pony up too
if we want quality.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.575
What exactly passes for quality here?

08:11.658 --> 08:14.411
Give it up for LOL_Trevor!

08:14.494 --> 08:16.330
You guys wanna see a little bit of fire?

08:16.413 --> 08:17.289
Yeah!

08:17.372 --> 08:18.498
All right.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.296
LOL!

08:27.758 --> 08:29.635
I love you, guys. Thank you so much.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.385
Remember, guys,
laugh out loud, live out loud...

08:34.222 --> 08:35.224
love out loud.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.101
LOL!

08:41.020 --> 08:43.023
Yeah! All right!

08:43.106 --> 08:45.025
See you, guys!
All right! Thank you! Peace!

08:47.528 --> 08:50.155
-What a fucking douchebag.
-Yeah, he's a piece of shit.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.991
It's LOL_Trevor though.
He's got a rock-solid fan base.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.245
I mean, he's almost sickeningly positive.
And he's cute as hell.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.913
Okay, I'll handle the negotiation.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.831
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna give him the terms,

08:59.915 --> 09:02.835
and then we're gonna leave before
he can answer. Standard power play.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.422
Excuse me. Excuse me, children.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.633
Hey, LOL_Trevor?

09:10.259 --> 09:13.178
What's up, man? Pleased to meet you.
I'm Brad. These are some of my colleagues.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.348
We are here on behalf of Mythic Quest.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.351
Yeah,
Pootie just bailed on you guys, right?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.435
That's exactly why we're here.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.437
We were hoping to come to some kind
of arrangement with you

09:22.521 --> 09:25.232
to help bridge the gap
left by our pal Pootie.

09:25.649 --> 09:29.736
I'm sorry. Are we not going to address
the large, menacing presence to our right?

09:29.820 --> 09:32.281
That's just my bodyguard.
He won't say shit.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.366
Great. I feel safer.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.450
I don't.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.535
I don't either.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.203
Sit down.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.913
Just-- I think.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.665
-You know what? I'm gonna stand.
-All right.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.294
So, LOL, how would you feel
about playing a new weapons update

09:45.377 --> 09:46.879
that we're releasing next month?

09:46.962 --> 09:49.131
I'm thinking, I don't know, $5,000?

09:49.214 --> 09:52.134
Yeah, I think I'm done dealing in dollars.
I deal in percentages now.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.052
Excuse me?

09:55.012 --> 09:57.848
He said he's done dealing in dollars.
He deals in percentages now.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.932
No, I heard what he said.

09:59.016 --> 10:02.686
I'm selling your weapons,
I want gross points. 10%.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.566
If he's selling your weapons,
he wants gross points.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.318
-No, I heard what he said again.
-Okay.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.945
Okay, I'm just processing this right now.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.490
-Gross points are points of the--
-I understand what gross points are, okay?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.743
And this is between me and Trevor.
We got this, man.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.204
-I'm just not familiar with this.
-It seems like you're losing him.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.289
I'm not losing him. I'm just not familiar
with this. I'm off my game.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.917
-Is this part of the negotiation tactic?
-You guys, shut the freak up.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.585
-I got this. I got this.
-Okay.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.296
10% or no deal.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.049
I'll let you guys think about it.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.343
Come on, Liam.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.101
What just happened?

10:44.019 --> 10:47.898
It would appear he gave you the terms
and then left before you could answer.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.441
It's a standard power play.

10:59.910 --> 11:03.705
Now, admittedly, game development
is a male-dominated field,

11:03.789 --> 11:05.999
but we are working hard to change that.

11:06.083 --> 11:10.295
Which is why we brought on board
folks like... Michelle!

11:10.379 --> 11:11.380
Hi, Michelle.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.215
Michelle is one of our amazing
female coders.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.842
-One of two.
-Thank you, Jo.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.970
Michelle, do you wanna tell the girls
what you're working on?

11:18.053 --> 11:19.346
My résumé.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.685
That's a joke.
Michelle has a very unique sense of humor.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.729
Okay, Michelle,
do you wanna just tell the girls

11:27.813 --> 11:30.148
what it's like to be a woman in tech?

11:30.232 --> 11:33.068
Sure. Which part
did you want me to talk about?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.988
The part where you have to work
twice as hard to make less money

11:36.071 --> 11:39.867
or the part where you can't get ahead
because it's a bro monoculture?

11:39.950 --> 11:44.329
Okay, well, that's not necessarily
the message we're trying to get across.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.914
Maybe you want to talk about

11:45.998 --> 11:48.667
what it's like to be a female
in a male-dominated field?

11:51.170 --> 11:53.755
I would not. Please go ahead.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.591
Great. Thanks for your permission.

11:56.091 --> 11:59.344
So no matter how smart you are
or how hard you work,

11:59.428 --> 12:02.014
your bosses will always
treat you a little bit differently

12:02.097 --> 12:03.724
because you're a woman.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.186
Unless your boss is a woman. Like Poppy.

12:07.269 --> 12:10.772
I was talking about Poppy.
She hates me because I'm a woman.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.734
See, because we're all fighting
for the same positions,

12:13.817 --> 12:15.986
it makes us incredibly competitive,

12:16.069 --> 12:19.698
which, of course,
we have to be in order to survive.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.075
So, in a way, I don't blame Poppy.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.245
In another way,
I hate her more than anyone alive.

12:25.329 --> 12:30.542
Can we please stay on message
and say something inspiring?

12:30.626 --> 12:34.796
Got it. Girls, here's the most important
piece of advice I can give you.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.006
Look to your left.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.633
Now look to the girl on your right.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.385
That's your competition.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.304
She's not your friend.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.556
You're going to have to fight her.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.809
Not physically. That's what men do.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.354
Emotionally. Up here.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.147
-Okay, that's enough from Michelle!
-I have more to say.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.692
I'm sure you do, and I respect that,
but we have a lot of women to meet.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.402
-Do we?
-We do. Come on. Let's go.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.487
There's no one else.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.280
Maybe there's someone more positive
we can meet?

13:00.364 --> 13:02.491
Yes. I know who we can go see.

13:03.867 --> 13:04.910
Oh, my!

13:04.993 --> 13:08.038
What a treat! And who might you ladies be?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.082
Sue, these young women
are from Girls Can Code...

13:10.165 --> 13:11.208
Hi, Sue.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.961
...and they're here
to be inspired by our female employees.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.214
Inspiration? Look no further
than the good book.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.341
I have got the inspiration right here.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.634
-Sue?
-This is-- Yeah?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.803
-Work stuff.
-Work stuff? Okay.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.472
-Just talk about the job and whatnot.
-Okay. Copy that.

13:25.556 --> 13:29.685
Listen, girls, oh my, it is just
so fantastic to see you all here.

13:29.768 --> 13:33.188
We can always, always,
always use more girls in gaming.

13:33.272 --> 13:34.106
What's this?

13:34.189 --> 13:39.236
No. That, sweetie,
that is just player feedback.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.362
So what do you do here?

13:40.779 --> 13:42.114
I'm the community manager.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.283
Yes. Sue has a very interesting job.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.742
She interacts with our players online

13:45.826 --> 13:49.121
to find out the things that they like
and don't like about Mythic Quest.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.040
Yeah. You know, and darn
if they don't like a lot of things!

13:52.124 --> 13:53.959
Sometimes I wonder why they play.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.919
What's a typical day like for you?

13:56.003 --> 13:58.630
How do I put this? Okay.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.382
You know... Girls,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.802
you know how when you just get
so mad and frustrated

14:03.886 --> 14:06.638
that you just wanna scream into a pillow?

14:06.722 --> 14:08.432
You know? When you're mad at your mom?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.059
I guess you could say,
for our player community,

14:11.143 --> 14:12.686
I'm kinda like their mom.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.063
And the pillow.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.815
You're super nice.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.192
I wanna do what you do.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.443
No!

14:20.277 --> 14:22.029
No. No.

14:25.949 --> 14:26.783
No.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.331
And that's... Sue.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.546
So, it has a really clean, simple design,

14:39.922 --> 14:43.008
and you'll see that it just responds
almost right away to your touch.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.260
But what's most cool about it
is it actually does

14:45.344 --> 14:47.513
procedural level generation,
with dynamic difficulty--

14:47.596 --> 14:48.597
Hi.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.516
Hi.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.727
Did you make this game?

14:54.311 --> 14:55.395
Yeah, I did.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.481
Cool. It's really impressive.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.317
Is that Masked Man?

15:00.734 --> 15:02.945
-Yeah.
-That's perfect. It's amazing.

15:03.028 --> 15:06.365
I know. It's really good with the mask on,
but it's kinda tricky to-- Yeah.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.575
-Oh, my God. Roscoe, right?
-Yeah.

15:08.659 --> 15:10.452
Yes! So good!

15:10.953 --> 15:14.581
So, I actually work at Mythic Quest.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.083
I'm the lead engineer.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.418
Are you Poppy Li?

15:18.961 --> 15:19.920
Yeah.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.173
That is so cool.

15:23.257 --> 15:24.383
It is.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.759
-You're historical.
-I know.

15:25.843 --> 15:26.760
-You're legendary.
-Yes.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.095
-You're so talented.
-Yes.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.264
-I grew up playing your game.
-Okay, that's enough.

15:30.347 --> 15:35.269
So we're actually looking for a streamer
right now to help promote the game.

15:35.352 --> 15:38.438
And... I'm just going with my gut here,

15:38.522 --> 15:40.524
but I think that you'd be perfect
for the gig.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.484
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:42.568 --> 15:46.905
I love Mythic Quest. It's, like,
the most beautifully designed game ever.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.073
Right.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.284
Now I bet I can finally break 200 subs!

15:51.118 --> 15:53.495
Sorry, you have less than 200 subscribers?

15:54.913 --> 15:56.039
What's this line for?

15:57.291 --> 15:58.375
The bathrooms.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.085
I don't even know why I come to the cons.

16:00.169 --> 16:02.212
My people skills are terrible,
so I never get new fans.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.381
Sometimes the-- Where are you going?

16:06.300 --> 16:07.676
-Hey, Poppy!
-Hey.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.428
-I'm having so much fun.
-Cool.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.221
I don't even know what
I'm standing in line for.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.223
But you know what? I bet it's amazing.

16:13.307 --> 16:16.310
You're in line for the bathrooms.
The men's bathrooms.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.228
Oh, well.

16:18.312 --> 16:21.106
Hey, you wanna go to the merch table
with me, buy some MQ shirts?

16:21.190 --> 16:23.150
You know you can get those
for free at work?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.235
Yeah, but they have
very special-edition ones

16:25.319 --> 16:27.029
just for the cons and I really want some.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.823
You go have fun!
Stand in as many lines as you want.

16:29.907 --> 16:31.408
I'm gonna go get a shitty pretzel.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.410
They're actually not shitty.
They're really good.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.037
-Really?
-I had four of 'em already.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.164
-That's so many pretzels...
-I know. I'm pretty stuffed.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.290
...for such a tiny person.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.461
Oh, yes. Yes. I see. I see!

16:44.087 --> 16:46.089
What the hell? The paladin killed me!

16:46.173 --> 16:47.299
That little shit.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.010
C.W. Avenge my death.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.554
-Hit him with a stun spell.
-Yes. Yes.

16:52.638 --> 16:54.181
-Okay, now fire spell.
-Yes.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.349
Smack him with a shovel!

16:55.933 --> 16:56.934
Again.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.977
Okay. Oh, my God.
He's almost dead! Hit him again!

16:59.937 --> 17:02.231
You killed him! You avenged me!

17:02.314 --> 17:05.400
Huzzah! Avenging the death
of a fellow guild member

17:05.483 --> 17:08.153
and seizing control of the land.
That was thrilling!

17:08.737 --> 17:11.740
I feel like Beowulf after he slew Grendel.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.575
I haven't seen Beowulf.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.828
Seen? No, it's an epic poem.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.539
It's a poem too?

17:18.622 --> 17:19.623
Shit.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.665
Have you no education at all?

17:22.501 --> 17:24.586
No, I have a BA in Women's Studies.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.213
-Women's Studies, huh?
-Yeah.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.382
What exactly is Women's Studies?

17:29.132 --> 17:33.053
It's an academic curricula which--
it follows the experiences of women

17:33.136 --> 17:34.888
and the contributions they've made to--

17:34.972 --> 17:36.348
Inquiry withdrawn.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.853
Okay, dude, look, the point is,
we just made a story together.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.438
And we were more invested
because we were a part of it.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.315
All that shit Ian says is right.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.944
Yes, but it's still missing something,
isn't it?

17:50.112 --> 17:52.531
Sit back, milady.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.910
And I'll show you something wonderful.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.627
Poppy? You're Poppy Li, right?

18:05.711 --> 18:06.628
Yeah.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.423
I'm Dan Williams,
producer at Cold Alliance Studios.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.799
Cold Alliance? Fuck you.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.469
Well, we're big fans of your work.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.472
Thank you! I'm a huge fan of yours too.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.808
Well, you just told me to fuck off.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.186
Well, but that was before
I knew that you liked me.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.856
That shovel update, that was brilliant.

18:26.481 --> 18:30.652
Thank you. That was actually
Ian's idea, to turn it into a weapon.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.821
I was actually talking
about the digging feature.

18:32.905 --> 18:36.783
It was such a novel way of integrating
persistent environmental changes.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.869
How did you know that would be so cool?

18:39.870 --> 18:43.248
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I just kind of felt it in my gut.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.750
Wow. You got great instincts.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.962
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Dan, was it?

18:49.046 --> 18:50.672
-Yeah, Dan Williams.
-Yeah, cool.

18:50.756 --> 18:53.133
Listen, I don't want to take up
much more of your time.

18:53.217 --> 18:56.553
But, well, we're looking for
a new creative director,

18:56.637 --> 18:58.889
and I think you'd be a perfect fit.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.432
Creative director?

19:02.726 --> 19:04.895
I'm actually--
I'm not looking for a new job.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.688
And you guys already poached Pootie, so...

19:06.772 --> 19:10.150
Well, what can I say? I mean,
when we find talent, we go after it.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.279
Cool. Thanks.

19:14.363 --> 19:17.074
You're welcome.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.867
-All right? Take care.
-Okay.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.871
Poppy! Poppy!

19:22.955 --> 19:27.626
I've done it. I have found our streamer.
Introducing Byron.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.547
Byron has been playing
MMORPGs for 20 years.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.507
And best of all,
he's never been paid for it.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.509
Also, he's a big fan of mine.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.844
He's a genius.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.596
This guy's like
a thousand in streamer years.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.390
-Guys!
-Hey.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.309
Guys, our streaming problems are over.

19:44.393 --> 19:45.853
Great. Another dude in his 40s.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.437
And God forbid you pick a woman.

19:47.521 --> 19:50.148
There's no such thing as a 40-year-old
woman in gaming. That's a fact.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.359
And secondly,
Stephen here isn't the streamer.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.443
Stephen?

19:54.778 --> 19:56.405
-Excuse me.
-Right. Okay.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.992
Meet Aiko.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.619
Aiko here is the future
of the streamer hustle.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.539
A 3-D model that I can completely control
in a mo-cap suit.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.623
It's a one-time cost.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.334
She never ages or gets a better offer,

20:09.418 --> 20:13.046
and we can make her do whatever we want.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.173
Aiko is happy!

20:14.256 --> 20:16.300
So you want to build a woman.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.219
-Sort of like a Weird Science situation.
-Exactly.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.680
-What's Weird Science?
-Oh, God!

20:21.763 --> 20:23.473
Goddamn it, Poppy.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.309
-Small Wonder?
-Yeah, like Small Wonder maybe.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.518
I don't know what that is.

20:26.602 --> 20:27.603
-What?
-God!

20:27.686 --> 20:30.147
All right, just because something is old
doesn't make it cool.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.064
-What?
-What do you--

20:31.148 --> 20:33.275
Do you even understand our culture?
You know what?

20:33.358 --> 20:34.443
-It doesn't matter.
-What culture?

20:34.526 --> 20:35.360
Awful. Awful.

20:35.444 --> 20:38.197
It's kind of creepy if I have to admit it.
My guy, I think, is a little bit better.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.449
Your guy? Your guy's got an ankle monitor.

20:43.744 --> 20:46.413
Byron! What's that for?

20:47.748 --> 20:49.458
-So--
-You know what? I don't want to know.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.542
No one wants to know.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.211
You know what?
You guys do whatever you want.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.879
I'm gonna go home. Where's my ride?

20:53.962 --> 20:55.589
-Okay, so we're gonna go with Aiko?
-Nope.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.136
Dana. Come on. Let's go.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.388
Hang on. I just gotta finish this.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.599
Are you playing Mythic Quest?

21:05.682 --> 21:07.518
You know you can do that
back at the office.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.312
I just got to the best part. I'm so close
to leveling up, and when I do,

21:10.395 --> 21:12.523
I get to finally equip
the Great Trident of Tethys,

21:12.606 --> 21:14.983
which has an insane DOT.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.151
All right, y'all.

21:16.235 --> 21:20.197
Chaining criticals. But don't worry,
your girl is a boss battle badass.

21:22.366 --> 21:23.367
Oh, my God.

21:28.205 --> 21:31.750
Guys. Guys. What if I told you
I found our new streamer?

21:31.834 --> 21:34.336
She's perfect.
She knows the game inside out.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.338
She appeals to a young, diverse crowd.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.006
She is so cool! She's--

21:38.090 --> 21:41.927
Oh, my God. She's talking about herself.
That is so sad.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.971
See, I told you she would do this.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.640
First of all, you're like
15 years too old.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.726
Dana! Dana is the new streamer.

21:49.810 --> 21:52.688
No, she's too good-looking. No one's
gonna believe that she's a real gamer.

21:52.771 --> 21:55.524
Okay, but the thing is
she is a real gamer.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.025
Yours isn't even a real person.

21:57.109 --> 21:59.403
-Okay, Pop? You're great.
-Yes.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.071
-At something very specific.
-Right.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.324
It's sort of like, well, I'm this painter
and you're my favorite brush.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.869
Okay, hold on. Are you just
about to recycle my whole thing

22:06.952 --> 22:08.662
about the brush and the--
I'm not gonna-- Just--

22:08.745 --> 22:12.040
Look, come over here, watch Dana play.

22:12.124 --> 22:13.709
She's got this whole crowd
of people around her.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.003
Great work, Pop. We're gonna go over here
and make the decision.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.713
No, you guys come with me.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.298
-See you back at the office.
-Thanks so much for your time.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.009
Guys, I really think I'm right about this!

22:46.450 --> 22:47.618
Wow.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.079
You're damn right.

22:51.622 --> 22:56.084
It's a touching, bittersweet
culmination to the story.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.088
C.W., you're a really good writer.

23:00.172 --> 23:01.798
I didn't even know this was our game.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.050
No. It's not.

23:03.634 --> 23:06.762
That's from Red Dead Redemption 2.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.682
What, you didn't write that?

23:11.225 --> 23:12.518
What about the other ones?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.394
That was Assassin's Creed.

23:14.478 --> 23:16.355
The one before that was Last of Us.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.982
None of these are yours?

23:20.567 --> 23:21.568
I'm afraid not.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.654
Why did we watch that then?

23:23.737 --> 23:26.448
To show you the power of story.

23:29.034 --> 23:33.121
Alas, I'm a stranger in a strange land

23:33.205 --> 23:38.877
and have yet to achieve
that level of emotional resonance.

23:40.504 --> 23:45.884
Outside of my novels, of course,
for which I did win a Nebula Award.

23:45.968 --> 23:47.261
Where the hell did that come from?

23:47.553 --> 23:48.554
Never mind that.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.765
Because you have opened my eyes.

23:51.849 --> 23:54.726
I now know that
I must engage with the game

23:54.810 --> 23:57.855
on its most fundamental level
by playing it.

23:58.939 --> 24:04.403
And that will unlock rich,
new stories for years to come.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.947
Just come in here, you know.

24:07.364 --> 24:10.784
We'll try this place again,
see if any ladies have emerged.

24:10.868 --> 24:13.537
How do we have so many
dudes that work here? How?

24:15.247 --> 24:16.248
Wait a second.

24:16.957 --> 24:20.836
The testers. The testers! Yes! Come, come.

24:20.919 --> 24:26.675
Okay, our testers
are actually not just one, but two ladies.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.802
Those aren't two ladies.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.513
We had a wonderful time.

24:31.597 --> 24:34.558
I just showed her mine,
and she showed me hers.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.935
Yeah, and first it was kinda weird
'cause he's old, you know?

24:37.019 --> 24:39.021
But, boy, does he know what he's doing.

24:39.396 --> 24:40.564
She cried.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.107
I did cry. Well, he cried too.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.234
I did. Come in, girls.

24:44.318 --> 24:45.402
Don't go in there!

24:45.485 --> 24:47.779
-Okay. I think that's enough.
-I think that's enough too!

24:47.863 --> 24:49.072
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Yeah.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.157
Let's--

24:55.245 --> 24:56.246
Poppy!

24:56.997 --> 24:59.041
Didn't you get my text?
We have a tour today.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.250
That was today?

25:00.334 --> 25:03.170
Nice. I guess your good instincts
don't include checking a calendar.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.379
Crap! I completely forgot.

25:04.922 --> 25:08.425
I don't want your excuses, okay?
These girls need to be inspired.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.969
-If it's inspiration you need, I can--
-Not you.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.180
You are the last person
they need to hear from.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.973
These girls need to talk to someone

25:15.057 --> 25:18.185
who understands what it's like
to be a girl who loves games.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.687
Someone who can speak to them
on their level and get them excited.

25:20.771 --> 25:23.106
-God, this is so sad.
-Is she talking about herself?

25:23.190 --> 25:25.859
She is, again. And I'm so embarrassed.
I'm actually really uncomfortable.

25:25.943 --> 25:28.946
I'm not talking about me!

25:29.863 --> 25:31.573
I'm talking about Dana.

25:35.911 --> 25:36.995
Come on.

25:37.955 --> 25:40.123
Hi! Hey, girls.

25:40.666 --> 25:43.293
This is Dana. She works here.

25:44.545 --> 25:45.879
What do you do?

25:47.297 --> 25:48.549
I play video games.

25:49.049 --> 25:51.009
That's your job? That's so cool!

25:51.093 --> 25:52.135
Cool!

25:53.011 --> 25:54.847
Yeah, it is cool.

25:56.932 --> 25:59.184
But it's also hard work sometimes.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.771
I mean, it's crazy
that this is a real job.

26:03.939 --> 26:08.819
But I play to make the game better
for our fans. And they pay me for it.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.405
And, yeah,
there aren't a lot of women here,

26:11.488 --> 26:15.701
but they hired me and my friend Rachel,
so they're trying.

26:18.370 --> 26:22.332
And to be totally honest, it's still
sometimes a hard place to be a girl.

26:23.125 --> 26:28.380
But I'm not gonna give up,
because I love my job and I'm good at it.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.048
-You feel me?
-Yeah.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.592
I'm good at it.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.639
And you know what else? Lean in.

26:41.310 --> 26:47.900
I'm so good at it, that when I play
against boys, I kick their butts.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.402
You girls like kicking butts, right?

26:50.485 --> 26:51.904
Yeah!

26:51.987 --> 26:53.280
Then come work here.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.035
Thank you, Dana. That was so inspiring.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.203
No biggie.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.413
You are so welcome.

27:01.496 --> 27:02.915
-Come on, girls.
-Bye, girls.

27:10.214 --> 27:11.965
Holy shit.

27:13.175 --> 27:14.760
Dana's the new streamer.

27:14.843 --> 27:17.513
She had me at "Ian is a genius."

27:17.596 --> 27:18.597
She didn't say that.

27:19.056 --> 27:21.308
-I think she did.
-No, I think she didn't.

27:21.391 --> 27:25.187
Also I told you guys that she is who
we should go with back at the convention.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.271
You did?

27:26.855 --> 27:28.690
Yes! You guys never listen to me.

27:28.774 --> 27:30.817
Hey, let's go give Dana the good news.

27:30.901 --> 27:32.319
Yeah, that'll feel good.

27:32.402 --> 27:35.864
Yeah, well, one of the best things
about being a boss is giving good news.

27:48.502 --> 27:51.713
Hello, Dan Williams. Let's talk.

27:52.673 --> 27:53.924
It's Poppy. Poppy Li.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.511
I'm sorry. When will he be back?

27:58.679 --> 28:00.013
Yeah, I can leave my number.

28:00.681 --> 28:01.849
Hey, stranger.

28:01.932 --> 28:05.519
Hey! Dude, I had the weirdest day,
but it was also kind of awesome.

28:05.602 --> 28:08.939
Me too. Ian and Brad
just asked me to be the new streamer.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.066
-Wait, what?
-Yeah!

28:11.149 --> 28:15.445
Just now. I mean, I guess it's kind of
shady to have an in-house streamer, right?

28:15.529 --> 28:17.531
But if it's what's best for the game...

28:18.448 --> 28:20.075
Yeah, yeah.

28:20.158 --> 28:22.119
I know that means
we won't be testing together anymore,

28:22.202 --> 28:24.329
but it's kind of my dream job, so...

28:25.789 --> 28:27.124
do you think I should do it?

28:28.917 --> 28:31.044
Yeah. Yeah. You should totally do it.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.129
-I should do it, right?
-Yeah.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.756
Oh, my God! This is crazy.

28:34.840 --> 28:35.883
I gotta call my mom.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.885
Crazy. Okay.

28:41.638 --> 28:42.848
Come on. Pick up.

28:42.931 --> 28:43.932
See ya.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.434
Ma. Hey!

28:45.517 --> 28:47.519
You will never guess
what happened at work today.

28:47.603 --> 28:51.064
Okay, so I went to the convention
with Ian, Brad, and Poppy, right?
