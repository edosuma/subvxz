10:45.112 --> 10:47.414
Oh, Gareth, I try so hard to please her.

10:47.415 --> 10:49.416
I invade a kingdom for a jewel,

10:49.417 --> 10:51.084
I respect her vow of chastity,

10:51.085 --> 10:53.753
and yet every day I have to hear it

This is all very exciting, My King,

12:51.938 --> 12:53.739
but Galavant still lives.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.008
And he is still the greatest
warrior in five kingdoms.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.178
Fine. If I can't win her love,
I'll buy it.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.846
Bring me the king and queen of Valencia.

13:00.847 --> 13:03.582
I'll find her that stupid jewel.

I didn't say 'banana' again?"

[Fingers snap]

13:18.030 --> 13:19.698
Galavant: Tommy.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.167
Tommy. Tommy!

13:22.168 --> 13:24.836
There appears to be a rather
large hole in my bucket,

13:24.837 --> 13:27.205
and I would very much like you to fix it.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.340
Sorry, Gal. I'm gonna have to cut you off.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.177
Tommy, come on. It's me.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.745
It's Gal.

13:33.746 --> 13:37.081
Hey, Gal. Come on.
You're embarrassing yourself.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.950
I'm embarrassing <i> yourself.</i>

[Thud]

13:48.994 --> 13:50.061
[Men snicker]

13:52.698 --> 13:53.865
Can I buy you a drink?

13:53.866 --> 13:55.066
No!

13:55.067 --> 13:57.101
Good. You can buy <i> me</i> one.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.303
Now, where were we?

13:58.304 --> 14:00.071
Two months ago, you were
imprisoned in a cellar.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.239
Then what happened?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.074
King Richard: Ah, here we are.

14:03.075 --> 14:04.809
Regular spots, please.
Thank you very much.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.244
I believe you know where to stand.

14:06.245 --> 14:10.782
Now, let me ask you <i> one</i> question.
I've tried to be kind to you.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.250
Have I not?

14:12.251 --> 14:14.685
You pillaged our peaceful kingdom,
killed half our army.

14:14.686 --> 14:15.753
But I haven't killed <i> you.</i>

14:15.754 --> 14:17.555
I mean, think about it.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.056
I've killed a massive amount
of people this week,

14:19.057 --> 14:21.759
but I haven't [Coughs] killed... kil...

14:21.761 --> 14:24.128
Gareth, I have a horribly scratchy throat.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.129
A bit of tea, please.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.297
Tea for the king!

14:26.298 --> 14:27.498
I'm not really a yeller.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.700
I've been fighting a bug
since the invasion.

14:29.701 --> 14:31.702
I swear, it's the plague.
It's not the plague.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.538
- Feel it, though... does that feel lumpy?
- No.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.707
- You didn't even feel it.
- We beg you to show mercy to our people,

14:36.708 --> 14:39.710
- good King Richard.
- [Chuckles] We've <i> done</i> this.

14:39.711 --> 14:42.546
Look, here's the thing.

14:42.547 --> 14:45.883
My wife <i> really</i> wants that jewel of yours.

14:45.884 --> 14:49.387
Now, I know, at times,
she can come off as a bit, um...

14:49.388 --> 14:51.155
[Inhales sharply] What's the word?

14:51.156 --> 14:52.323
- Evil.
- Cruel.

14:52.324 --> 14:53.447
No, that's not it. It's more...

14:53.448 --> 14:54.673
- Sadistic.
- Vicious.

14:54.675 --> 14:56.494
You know, I think you really
just have to get to know her.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.795
She can be a [Bleep]

14:57.796 --> 14:59.130
- Would you stop it, Gareth?!
- All right.

14:59.131 --> 15:00.965
How's about this?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.067
You tell me where the jewelry is,

15:03.068 --> 15:04.275
we'll pack up shop.

15:04.276 --> 15:06.103
We'll stop the pillaging and the killing,

15:06.104 --> 15:08.272
yada, yada, and everyone's happy.

15:08.273 --> 15:10.107
The Jewel of Valencia is priceless.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.208
I know. I know.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.377
It is a symbol of Valencia.
It has belonged not to us,

15:13.378 --> 15:15.113
but to our people for thousands of years.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.782
Totally understand. Totally empathize.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.617
- Can I have it?
- Never!

15:19.618 --> 15:21.619
[Sighs]

15:21.620 --> 15:24.789
This is so not how I wanted to do this!

15:24.790 --> 15:27.558
It is about to get very messy in here.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.294
Ooh, my tea! Thank you very much.

15:31.462 --> 15:33.631
Mm.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.600
Is there lemon in there?

15:36.829 --> 15:38.769
Yes... My King?

15:38.770 --> 15:41.706
Some unsqueezed lemons.

15:41.707 --> 15:45.376
Well, it's delightful. Just delightful.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.711
[Sighs]

15:46.712 --> 15:48.045
Kill the king, make her watch.

15:48.046 --> 15:49.547
No!

15:49.548 --> 15:52.550
[Woman gasps]

15:52.551 --> 15:55.252
Mmm.

15:55.253 --> 15:56.754
Mmm. [Lips smack]

15:56.755 --> 15:59.256
Sid, fetch me a drink.

15:59.257 --> 16:03.260
When he tells me to fetch,
those are my favorite moments.

16:04.996 --> 16:06.664
Thanks again for the drink.

16:06.665 --> 16:07.765
<i>Drinks.</i>

16:08.632 --> 16:11.133
Right. Thanks again.

16:11.283 --> 16:14.271
My father used to tell stories of you,

16:14.272 --> 16:16.507
- of your skill in battle...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.704
Your heroism, of your goodness.

16:21.361 --> 16:22.780
What happened to you?

16:22.781 --> 16:24.915
I mean... eh.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.286
Oh, come on. I've come a long way.

16:29.287 --> 16:31.789
Surely I deserve some kind of backstory.

16:31.790 --> 16:32.823
[Sighs]

16:34.025 --> 16:36.360
[Chuckles]

16:36.361 --> 16:39.196
All right. [Inhales deeply]

16:39.197 --> 16:42.533
My parents were people of
massive, massive appetites.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.035
They loved everything... they
loved food. They loved drink.

16:45.036 --> 16:47.304
But most of all, they loved each other.

16:47.305 --> 16:50.140
Ironically, they also hated each other.

16:50.141 --> 16:53.143
[Clears throat] And they
fought violently every day.

16:53.144 --> 16:55.512
Didn't have time for much else, in fact.

16:55.513 --> 16:58.515
So... at the age of 8, I swore off love.

16:58.516 --> 16:59.950
[Chuckles]

16:59.951 --> 17:02.319
Devoted myself to doing
something better with my life

17:02.320 --> 17:04.488
than wasting it on love.

17:04.489 --> 17:07.824
So I read, I trained, I learned languages.

17:07.825 --> 17:09.826
All the time other young men
chasing spent chasing girls,

17:09.827 --> 17:12.704
I spent that time bettering myself.

17:13.556 --> 17:15.866
But I come from a long family of lovers.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.367
You can't fight genetics.

17:18.368 --> 17:21.505
So when it inevitably happened...

17:21.506 --> 17:23.506
- When I fell...
- You fell hard.

17:23.508 --> 17:24.808
I fell hard.

17:24.809 --> 17:25.976
And her?

17:26.715 --> 17:28.478
[Squeaks]

17:28.479 --> 17:30.013
She fell softer...

17:30.014 --> 17:32.082
As it turns out.

17:33.751 --> 17:36.253
[Sighs]

17:36.254 --> 17:38.588
Look, I'd love to help. Really, I would.

17:38.589 --> 17:40.090
But I'm...

17:40.091 --> 17:42.359
I'm sort of out of the whole
"damsel in distress" business

17:42.360 --> 17:43.827
at the moment, so...

17:43.828 --> 17:46.563
I listened from below
as he ordered my parents to their death.

17:46.564 --> 17:48.365
And after coming all this way,

17:48.366 --> 17:50.367
your advice is for me
to just turn a blind eye

17:50.368 --> 17:52.536
and watch king Richard destroy my kingdom

17:52.537 --> 17:54.538
and everyone I've ever loved?

17:55.047 --> 17:56.113
What?

17:58.748 --> 18:00.577
Did you just say...

18:00.578 --> 18:02.145
"King Richard"?

18:04.343 --> 18:05.343
Oh, come here!

18:05.344 --> 18:06.849
- Isabella.
- Father!

18:07.513 --> 18:09.514
Ah!

18:10.038 --> 18:12.779
Maybe <i> this</i> is what we're looking for.

18:15.187 --> 18:16.754
Ooh, sweet!

18:16.755 --> 18:18.089
Any luck on the Jewel, Richard?

18:18.716 --> 18:19.824
Well, actually, my dear...

18:19.825 --> 18:21.793
I know. I know. You're working on it.

18:21.794 --> 18:23.594
Well, why don't you stop working on it,

18:23.595 --> 18:28.099
start acting like Galavant,
and <i> do something</i> already?

18:30.376 --> 18:32.277
Will do, My Queen.

18:33.539 --> 18:34.906
[Sighs]

18:34.907 --> 18:39.177
I swear, if I have to hear
the name Galavant one more time.

18:39.178 --> 18:42.180
If only there was some way that I could...

18:43.341 --> 18:44.248
Ah.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.716
She's a pretty young thing,
isn't she, Gareth?

18:45.718 --> 18:48.755
- A bit plump for my liking.
- Plump?

18:48.756 --> 18:50.354
The girl is 100 pounds soaking wet.

18:50.355 --> 18:54.365
I know, but I like skinny.
Like, really unhealthy skinny.

18:55.027 --> 18:56.527
[Sighs]

18:56.528 --> 18:58.296
You love your parents, don't you, my dear?

18:58.297 --> 18:59.730
Leave my parents be.

18:59.731 --> 19:02.366
Leave them be, or so help me,
I will kill you myself.

19:02.367 --> 19:03.634
And spunky.

19:03.635 --> 19:05.036
Ha! More like "chunky"!

19:05.037 --> 19:06.070
Just stop it, Gareth!

19:06.071 --> 19:08.105
I am trying to do something here!

19:08.106 --> 19:10.441
Fine. If we can't beat
Galavant on his turf,

19:10.442 --> 19:12.143
we'll bring him to our own.

19:12.144 --> 19:13.978
If you want your parents to live,

19:13.979 --> 19:15.646
you will travel to find Galavant.

19:15.647 --> 19:19.650
You tell him that I, king Richard,
have invaded your kingdom.

19:19.651 --> 19:21.652
Offer to pay him with the jewel.

19:21.653 --> 19:26.657
When that doesn't work,
I want you to tell him this...

19:26.658 --> 19:28.292
I feel like you should be
writing this down.

19:28.294 --> 19:30.629
- I will remember it.
- It's a bit long.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.933
I'd really just be more
comfortable if you wrote it down.

19:32.935 --> 19:35.261
- I will remember it.
- Like a steel trap.

19:35.263 --> 19:38.238
- Always had a wonderful memory, this one.
- Fine.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.337
You tell him that king Richard is a...

19:40.338 --> 19:42.506
Is a cruel and vicious man.

19:42.507 --> 19:44.408
Four months I hid in that cellar.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.410
He and his queen slept right above me.

19:46.411 --> 19:49.747
And you tell him that every night,

19:49.747 --> 19:51.080
you would listen while
he screamed at his queen...

19:51.082 --> 19:54.418
Screamed at his queen,
and each night I would be left

19:54.419 --> 19:56.987
with only the sobs of that poor woman.

19:56.988 --> 20:00.491
Every night, she would cry out,
"I made the wrong choice.

20:00.492 --> 20:04.300
I'm so sorry, Gals. I'm so sorry."

20:04.302 --> 20:06.710
She must have left some maidens back home.

20:06.712 --> 20:08.312
Never knew what she meant.

20:08.314 --> 20:10.215
"I'm so sorry, Gals."

20:12.396 --> 20:14.605
[Echoing] I love you, Gal.

20:15.427 --> 20:17.107
"I'm so sorry, Gal."

20:17.638 --> 20:20.802
She was saying, "I'm so sorry, Gal."

20:22.810 --> 20:25.282
We leave tomorrow at sunrise.

20:25.283 --> 20:29.019
Pack lightly.
There's a long journey ahead.
