WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:06.913
You're nothing.
You're worthless.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.913
Mom, a lot's happened
since last I saw you.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.515
I'm not gonna run.
You should probably leave.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.719
This is exactly what you do when shit
like this happens. You shut down.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
Who are you?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.837
Just a brave traveler

00:20.040 --> 00:21.474
who's finally come home.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.758
Susan Jacobs,
the general counsel at E Corp.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.150
When they cleared E Corp,
you laughed.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.520
<i>There's security camera footage
of him kidnapping Miss Alderson.</i>

00:35.320 --> 00:37.437
Unless you finish cleaning up
Santiago's mess,

00:37.520 --> 00:40.797
I'm gonna be forced to do something
very bad to your mother.

00:40.880 --> 00:41.936
<i>We found their heart.</i>

00:41.960 --> 00:44.031
We rob it,
she finally goes down.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.952
I know all about
Cyprus National Bank!

00:46.040 --> 00:47.235
Her money's
as good as gone.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.356
You hear me?

00:48.440 --> 00:50.080
<i>Is that her
in the SUV outside?</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:52.951
Welcome back, Mr. Alderson.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.033
<i>A symbolic breach
in the structure that separated millions</i>

01:10.120 --> 01:12.112
<i>and claimed
hundreds of lives.</i>

01:13.040 --> 01:15.509
<i>That was 1989.</i>

01:15.600 --> 01:17.478
<i>The world was up for grabs.</i>

01:18.240 --> 01:21.836
<i>All the money, power,
natural resources.</i>

01:21.920 --> 01:24.674
<i>Hell, even borders
were negotiable.</i>

01:25.720 --> 01:30.397
<i>The Soviet Union, a great world
superpower was collapsing.</i>

01:31.040 --> 01:33.680
<i>Where some saw freedom,</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:39.472
<i>a young, imaginative
Minister Zhang saw possibility.</i>

01:40.040 --> 01:42.111
<i>A new world order.</i>

01:43.080 --> 01:47.313
<i>So, Zhang formed an investment
group called Deus.</i>

01:47.640 --> 01:51.998
<i>The goal, bring together the world's
wealthiest, most powerful men</i>

01:52.080 --> 01:57.633
<i>to consolidate, control and
manipulate global events for profit.</i>

01:58.240 --> 02:02.075
<i>Zhang courted dignitaries,
world leaders, oligarchs, businessmen,</i>

02:02.160 --> 02:04.152
<i>and he was
a damn good salesman.</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:07.677
<i>The potential profit outweighed
anyone's moral reservations,</i>

02:07.760 --> 02:09.955
<i>which was proven true
in an early endeavor,</i>

02:11.000 --> 02:12.593
<i>the First Gulf War.</i>

02:14.440 --> 02:16.511
<i>Something is
happening outside.</i>

02:16.600 --> 02:18.990
<i>The skies over Baghdad
have been illuminated.</i>

02:19.840 --> 02:23.277
<i>A few backroom deals,
a promise here, a bribe there.</i>

02:23.360 --> 02:26.159
<i>Like that, the Deus Group
was rich on oil</i>

02:26.240 --> 02:29.472
<i>and had a foothold in the military
industrial sector.</i>

02:30.240 --> 02:32.118
<i>With the right
players in place,</i>

02:33.080 --> 02:36.391
<i>running the world turned out
to be surprisingly easy.</i>

02:36.880 --> 02:39.475
<i>And I have to say,
business was booming.</i>

02:40.520 --> 02:44.594
<i>With his network of hackers
and terrorists in place,</i>

02:44.680 --> 02:47.878
<i>Zhang suggested that Deus Group
look in a new direction.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:50.429
<i>Industrial espionage
was yesterday's work.</i>

02:50.680 --> 02:53.798
<i>What better way to gain
leverage on everyone,</i>

02:53.880 --> 02:56.031
<i>than if everyone
was connected?</i>

02:56.760 --> 02:59.116
<i>During my service
in Congress,</i>

02:59.240 --> 03:02.312
I took the initiative
in creating the Internet.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.877
<i>The United States
was a test case.</i>

03:05.680 --> 03:09.754
<i>Americans seemed the most ready
to give their lives over to a box.</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:17.671
<i>Without hesitation,
everyone jumped online.</i>

03:17.800 --> 03:19.632
<i>Welcome. You've got mail.</i>

03:19.760 --> 03:21.056
<i>Offered everything
they had.</i>

03:21.080 --> 03:23.800
<i>Bank accounts, electric bills,
medical records,</i>

03:23.880 --> 03:25.712
<i>DNA data, baby pictures.</i>

03:26.160 --> 03:28.516
<i>We staged the biggest coup
in human civilization</i>

03:28.600 --> 03:31.593
<i>and the whole world volunteered
to take part, opted in,</i>

03:31.680 --> 03:34.149
<i>checked the box,
and clicked "I agree."</i>

03:35.440 --> 03:36.999
<i>With the Deus Group
behind it,</i>

03:37.080 --> 03:39.914
<i>E Corp became
the world's biggest front.</i>

03:40.000 --> 03:41.957
<i>With every new device
we rolled out,</i>

03:42.040 --> 03:45.556
<i>it was a new way for the Deus Group
to manipulate the public.</i>

03:46.800 --> 03:49.998
<i>But as the world embraced
the Digital Age,</i>

03:50.080 --> 03:53.960
<i>we began to see that Zhang had been
perfectly positioning himself</i>

03:54.040 --> 03:56.157
<i>to take total control.</i>

03:57.640 --> 04:00.838
<i>Zhang's billion-dollar
machine.</i>

04:00.920 --> 04:05.711
<i>He clandestinely built it under
the Washington Township Nuclear Power Plant.</i>

04:06.440 --> 04:09.990
<i>The Deus Group now understood
we were working for Zhang,</i>

04:10.080 --> 04:11.150
<i>not with him.</i>

04:11.240 --> 04:15.553
<i>His pet project,
which we'd belittled for years</i>

04:15.640 --> 04:19.680
<i>had been the singular purpose
of the Deus Group all along.</i>

04:40.520 --> 04:43.274
Consider yourself lucky,
Mr. Alderson,

04:44.560 --> 04:48.156
that I was the one alerted
when you walked into that apartment.

04:48.880 --> 04:53.318
It's my duty to dispose
of any intruder,

04:54.360 --> 04:56.113
and report the attempt.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.795
But you didn't.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.680
Why?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.195
<i>Crazy, right?</i>

05:11.280 --> 05:13.590
<i>Yeah, I never thought
we'd still be here, either.</i>

05:15.480 --> 05:16.834
<i>Thought we were goners.</i>

05:19.960 --> 05:21.713
<i>But here we are,
still alive.</i>

05:23.240 --> 05:25.197
<i>But that's not
the crazy part.</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
<i>The crazy part is...</i>

05:28.360 --> 05:31.159
<i>We were saved by him,
the enemy.</i>

05:32.360 --> 05:34.670
<i>One we've been after
this whole time.</i>

05:35.000 --> 05:37.913
<i>Question is, what's the angle?
What's the cost?</i>

05:38.240 --> 05:41.119
<i>Because one thing we know
by now, it ain't free.</i>

05:41.920 --> 05:43.070
It won't work.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.556
Your heist.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.711
But you just said
the Deus Group

05:49.800 --> 05:52.759
funds Whiterose's project
and the Dark Army.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.474
If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

05:57.120 --> 05:58.679
Whiterose loses everything.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.593
But like I said,

06:01.240 --> 06:04.039
the Deus Group
is impenetrable.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.358
Whiterose designed it
that way.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.594
You can get us in.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.155
Excuse me?

06:17.480 --> 06:21.793
It's like you said, E Corp is
a front for the Deus Group.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.791
Last I checked,
you're still the CEO.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.271
We can take them all down
if we work together.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.153
You have to have
a contact at the bank

06:36.240 --> 06:38.800
that can get me the Deus Group
account numbers.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.599
A real contact.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.634
Susan Jacobs.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.035
General counsel
at E Corp,

06:49.120 --> 06:53.512
she was my designated associate
for Cyprus National Bank.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.080
She handled everything.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.232
Withdrawals, deposits,
transfers.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.637
I would just receive a text to authorize
the transaction. But she...

07:04.720 --> 07:07.554
I can get around
two-factor authentication,

07:07.640 --> 07:09.233
I just need their
phone numbers.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
What...

07:11.320 --> 07:13.357
You think the Crown Prince
of Saudi Arabia

07:13.440 --> 07:16.114
has the same cell phone number
for more than five days?

07:16.280 --> 07:18.715
Or the chairman of
Royal Dutch Shell?

07:18.880 --> 07:20.109
Let me worry
about that.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.637
Just tell me how I can get a hold
of this contact of yours.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.554
Well, that's where you'll run
into some difficulty.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.077
Susan Jacobs disappeared
months ago.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.791
And given how open Whiterose is
about my inevitable exit from the group,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.912
I haven't received
another contact.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.390
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson,

07:43.840 --> 07:47.038
but I really
can't help you.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.239
You know what
they've done.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.376
You're just gonna let them
keep doing it?

07:56.400 --> 08:00.792
You're trying to stop a speeding train
by standing in front of it.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.476
All this...
This is just a blip!

08:05.240 --> 08:06.356
They won't even notice.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.432
Whiterose killed
your daughter.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.156
You think I didn't look
into you, too?

08:28.040 --> 08:31.397
I don't know how you justify
the shit you do.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.913
Maybe you wanna look back
at what Whiterose did to Angela,

08:41.039 --> 08:44.556
and see it as
a necessary evil.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.909
A cost of doing business?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.875
Or maybe you don't
look back at it at all?

08:54.400 --> 08:56.995
Because deep down
you know what happened,

08:58.400 --> 09:01.916
what's been happening
is wrong.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.637
Something inside you
is telling you

09:06.720 --> 09:09.394
to stop looking
the other way.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.113
That can start here.

09:35.080 --> 09:39.074
Even if I were to agree
to help you...

09:41.440 --> 09:45.275
It's like I said,
this heist...

09:46.840 --> 09:48.672
It's not possible.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.190
I'll find Susan Jacobs.
Just get them all in a room together.

09:55.480 --> 09:59.918
You want me to randomly
request that the entire Deus Group

10:00.000 --> 10:03.755
gather in one place
without even a pretext?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.160
In the next eight days.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.795
Eight days? Is that all?

10:08.920 --> 10:10.070
That's all I got.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.914
Once Whiterose starts
shipping her project, I'm dead.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.118
And how do you expect me
to pull this off?

10:17.480 --> 10:21.269
You've done Whiterose's bidding
thus far and paid a horrible cost.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.150
That loyalty won't
be lost on her.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.673
You can use that.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.998
And if it's your life
you're worried about...

10:42.200 --> 10:43.759
Doing nothing...

10:46.160 --> 10:48.072
Not fighting back...

10:52.480 --> 10:54.278
You may as well
be dead.

11:00.840 --> 11:04.151
I became
a dead man walking...

11:06.600 --> 11:09.832
The minute I agreed
to work with Whiterose.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.759
Just like you.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.992
What are we supposed
to do now?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.593
He isn't out.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.952
He just walked
out that door.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.237
I'd be dead on the floor of
my apartment if he didn't want in.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.390
He'll be back.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.038
Besides, he just gave us
the name of his bank contact.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.710
A contact that's been missing
for months.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.920
So, we find out
why she disappeared,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.719
and take anything
she left behind.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.994
- Yeah.
<i>- It's Mom.</i>

12:08.440 --> 12:10.352
<i>She's gone, Elliot.</i>

12:12.480 --> 12:15.951
Your mom was the nicest,
most thoughtful woman.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.158
When my dad died, she gave me
a shoulder to cry on.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.755
Always had a kind word
for everyone.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.272
You two must feel so blessed
to have had her in your life.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.638
Yeah, we feel
totally blessed.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.560
What are we
supposed to do?

12:35.680 --> 12:36.680
Um...

12:36.760 --> 12:40.071
Well, when my dad died,
I turned towards the Lord...

12:40.160 --> 12:41.640
I mean
with the boxes.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.040
Uh... Oh.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.679
Oftentimes like, families find sentimental
value in their loved one's possessions.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.114
Donate everything.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.911
Staff are not allowed to pack up
a deceased patient's belongings.

12:59.560 --> 13:04.077
You can put a Post-it note on the boxes
with the items you wish to donate.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.829
About yesterday...

13:28.760 --> 13:31.355
I know I was
a little mental.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
We're cool.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.794
Are you just
saying that, or...

13:36.320 --> 13:39.233
No, we're good.
Let's just get this done.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.474
Score.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.156
Are you
gonna help?

14:18.520 --> 14:19.840
What's the hurry?

14:22.280 --> 14:24.237
She's not gonna
get any deader.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.949
You know, for someone who refused
to enter this room the last few years,

14:29.720 --> 14:31.757
you seem pretty comfortable now
with her gone.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.353
Don't you feel
a little relieved?

14:39.560 --> 14:41.870
I know I sound like
a total dick, but...

14:42.840 --> 14:44.433
You feel it, too, right?

14:46.560 --> 14:47.710
I guess.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.999
You know what?
Fuck it.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.635
Why should I feel like
a dick for being happy?

14:58.400 --> 15:00.392
She was an asshole
to us.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.120
And now I don't ever have
to think about her again.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.991
Rad, your old Walkman.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.151
Why's it even here?
Mom hated music.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.755
Doesn't matter.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.120
Hold up.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.633
I'll take it
if you don't.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.953
Cassettes are
full-on back.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
What?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.912
Mom had
a safe deposit box?

16:05.840 --> 16:08.230
And how long
did you work under ASAC Santiago?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.759
Three years. Since I started
at the New York office.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.513
Describe his disposition
as a senior agent for me.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.759
How'd he treat his squad?
Any quirks, oddities?

16:20.840 --> 16:21.910
No.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.391
Santiago was always
even-keeled.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.949
He treated everyone fairly,
with respect,

16:28.040 --> 16:29.997
both in the office
and out in the field.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.792
Did you ever see Agent Santiago
do anything suspicious

16:36.880 --> 16:40.157
or out of character before
his disappearance on October 23rd?

16:42.240 --> 16:43.993
What do you mean
by "suspicious"?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.913
It's not every day an ASAC ups
and erases security cam footage

16:48.000 --> 16:51.437
from the FBI's parking garage before
dropping off the face of the earth.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.880
Oh, right.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.190
You okay there,
Agent DiPierro?

16:58.280 --> 17:01.352
Sorry, you just...
You seem a little out of it.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.118
You getting enough rest?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.992
Can I...

17:08.680 --> 17:10.398
Just have some water?

17:11.720 --> 17:12.836
Okay.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.518
Sir, there's something I know
I should tell you, but...

17:37.600 --> 17:38.920
But what?

17:45.360 --> 17:47.113
We're both here
for the same reason.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.438
To find Agent Santiago,
make sure he's safe.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.376
Now, if there's anything
you can do to help us...

17:54.400 --> 17:56.790
I think Agent Santiago
was a double agent.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.355
A double agent?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.716
Yes.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.640
To be clear, Agent DiPierro,

18:11.720 --> 18:14.758
you're accusing your former
commanding officer, your FBI mentor,

18:14.840 --> 18:17.036
of working as an operative
against the Bureau?

18:19.240 --> 18:20.240
I'm sorry, Agent Horton.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.789
I'm just having a little
trouble saying this aloud,

18:23.800 --> 18:25.598
knowing it's on the record...

18:32.640 --> 18:33.994
I'm worried.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.479
Worried about
what might happen,

18:37.560 --> 18:38.835
about the repercussions.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.280
What repercussions?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.832
Santiago was working with
some awfully dangerous people.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.719
No agent wants to see
their brother, their sister,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.156
on the wrong side of the law.
I get that.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.272
But you know it's our duty to uphold
the integrity of the Bureau.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.433
Now, take a breath.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.958
Whenever you're set.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.799
Can you tell me who Agent Santiago
was working with?

19:40.040 --> 19:41.918
The Trujillo drug cartel.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.839
<i>...people who break the law.</i>

19:53.000 --> 19:55.879
<i>And back then in that place,
in that time,</i>

19:55.960 --> 20:00.557
<i>what the state did to people as part of,
you know, lawful justice,</i>

20:00.640 --> 20:03.917
<i>is worse than anything
Charles Manson did</i>

20:04.000 --> 20:06.720
<i>to the people that
he had killed in his name.</i>

20:08.640 --> 20:11.712
<i>What Charles Manson's followers did
to the Manson murder victims</i>

20:11.800 --> 20:14.395
<i>is merciful by the standards
of the lawful justice...</i>

20:14.480 --> 20:16.597
- Dugout.
<i>- Bonsai.</i>

20:16.680 --> 20:19.149
Dominique, nice to
hear your voice.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.074
<i>How was the interview?</i>

20:21.160 --> 20:22.753
Fine. We're good.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.311
Clarify for me what
you mean by "good."

20:29.960 --> 20:31.076
Um...

20:31.160 --> 20:32.719
I fed them
the cover story.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.793
He bought it and praised me
for coming forward.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.354
<i>That's encouraging.</i>

20:38.080 --> 20:40.959
<i>So, you believe it was
a successful meeting,</i>

20:41.040 --> 20:43.600
<i>that your colleagues believe
all is aboveboard?</i>

20:44.760 --> 20:47.832
I mean, I was a little nervous
at the start, but then I was fine.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.034
Totally fine.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.190
<i>Agent Horton bought it.
I'm sure of it.</i>

20:54.480 --> 20:56.472
Clarify "sure."

21:02.920 --> 21:05.196
I mean, I don't know.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.318
As sure as I can be,
I guess. 99.9% sure.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.071
Interesting.
Well, it is just

21:13.440 --> 21:14.556
<i>a red-letter day.</i>

21:14.640 --> 21:18.475
<i>Now, I know beginnings
are always the hardest,</i>

21:18.600 --> 21:23.994
but it's best for everyone if you
stay calm and keep a level head.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.510
Just one moment. I'm just
finishing a phone call.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.072
Dominique, I want you to know
that we are very pleased

21:38.160 --> 21:40.038
that you are back to
work and on the mend.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.395
<i>Don't be a stranger.</i>

21:41.480 --> 21:44.837
<i>Let us know if there's anything you need,
and we'll do the same.</i>

21:47.800 --> 21:50.190
Sorry to keep you waiting.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.671
You know, holidays. Busy, busy, busy.
What can I do for you?

21:53.840 --> 21:56.435
I want Beatrice
with me forever.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.121
<i>...were adulterous
or involved in fornication,</i>

21:59.160 --> 22:01.117
<i>which basically means
sex outside of marriage,</i>

22:01.200 --> 22:02.520
<i>you get your head cut off.</i>

22:04.360 --> 22:07.114
<i>There's the cost
of living and the cost of dying.</i>

22:07.440 --> 22:10.478
<i>Seems you're paying the price
whether you're coming or going.</i>

22:12.000 --> 22:13.992
This is taking
way too long.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.993
Susan Jacobs?

22:16.080 --> 22:17.275
No, death.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.998
We have to
get back to work.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.835
Still running the password cracker
on her Ecoin wallet, but nothing yet.

22:25.840 --> 22:29.277
<i>And then there's
the real price. Not cash or Ecoin...</i>

22:29.840 --> 22:31.638
<i>The emotional toll.</i>

22:31.960 --> 22:33.758
How are you doing
with all this?

22:34.360 --> 22:36.920
As soon as we get
the death certificate, I'm done.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.471
<i>The toll Elliot
isn't willing to pay,</i>

22:39.560 --> 22:42.234
<i>whether he's not ready to,
orjust doesn't want to.</i>

22:43.880 --> 22:46.315
I'm not talking
about paperwork, kiddo.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.313
I'm talking about the fact
that your mom died this morning.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.880
Maybe you should take a minute,
deal with what's happening?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.953
What the fuck
are you talking about?

22:57.360 --> 23:00.080
I'm kind of an expert
at observing you.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.395
All I'm saying is that you need to stop
and take in your mom's death,

23:05.240 --> 23:08.836
or it's gonna eat away at you like
everything else you're holding in.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.831
Here's the only thing
I'm holding in.

23:14.680 --> 23:18.640
We need to take down Whiterose,
or we die.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.520
Darlene dies.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.916
Did your expert observation
also pick up on that?

23:29.760 --> 23:32.480
<i>I agree.
That could've gone better.</i>

23:34.000 --> 23:35.320
<i>Fuck you.</i>

23:36.760 --> 23:41.073
Okay, I mean, how the hell should I know
what she would have wanted?

23:46.400 --> 23:47.959
Don't look at me
like that.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.555
Yeah, she was my mom,
but we weren't close.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.393
There was no, "These are
my last wishes" conversation.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.392
I mean, fuck...

23:58.200 --> 24:00.635
I can't even remember
the last time we spoke.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.880
So, give me a goddamn break here,
all right?

24:09.400 --> 24:12.120
Cremation. Cardboard coffin.
Cheapest urn.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.199
You're not even a little curious
about what's in it?

24:22.880 --> 24:26.476
I mean, she went through the process
of opening a safe deposit box.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.395
That is not the woman
we grew up with. So...

24:31.320 --> 24:34.711
There's gotta be something
important in there, right?

24:38.320 --> 24:39.515
Hello?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.073
Bueller? Are you alive?

24:43.960 --> 24:47.078
No, Darlene, I don't think
there's anything important in there.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.314
Well, you don't
know that for sure.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.359
I mean, maybe there are
some secrets.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.715
"Secrets"?

24:54.080 --> 24:57.039
I don't know, like, the secret
to why Mom was such a bitch?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.309
Money?

25:00.560 --> 25:02.870
The deed to
a chateau in France?

25:05.280 --> 25:06.794
Adoption papers?

25:09.240 --> 25:10.959
Your adoption papers?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.598
Yo! Asshole.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.512
Please stop
ignoring me.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.796
What the fuck is with you, man?
I'm here, aren't I?

25:19.680 --> 25:22.832
No, you're not. I thought
you said we were cool.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.115
We are cool.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.034
Okay, then prove it.
Come with me to the bank.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.759
What is the point?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.869
It's not gonna change
the fact that Mom's dead.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.156
Just fucking
come with me!

25:38.960 --> 25:41.680
I need to go, okay?

25:50.880 --> 25:52.792
Remember when
we were kids...

25:53.600 --> 25:55.432
And you were scared,

25:55.520 --> 25:57.637
you were having
one of your episodes.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.156
And I would tell you
to squeeze my hand.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.516
And as long as you could feel my hand
that you knew I was there,

26:05.600 --> 26:09.514
and it was okay and
everything was real.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.750
Well, now, I need you
to help me...

26:18.400 --> 26:21.711
Make me feel like
everything is okay.

26:25.320 --> 26:29.075
You're not gonna find any answers
in an old safe deposit box.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.839
Then it'll be
a short trip.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.474
Condolences.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.110
He's an Irish mobster
out of Hell's Kitchen,

26:49.200 --> 26:50.953
trying to recreate
the glory days,

26:51.040 --> 26:53.316
but online instead
of the streets.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.237
Operates what looks like
a legitimate shipping website.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.191
But shipping people,
Mr. Maguire?

27:03.200 --> 27:05.556
More like
disappearing people.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.235
We pieced together
his Alpha Bay connections

27:08.320 --> 27:12.280
and IDed 17 career criminals
he helped walk off the street.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.794
Never to be seen again,

27:14.880 --> 27:18.874
living happy lives under new names
all over the world.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
Mr. Maguire.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.513
You and I, we could
help each other.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.736
You talk to me, maybe I could
put in a good word...

27:27.760 --> 27:29.274
You seem a kind lass.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.597
And I'd love to help you help me,
should I need the helping.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.392
But I'm an innocent man.
You see?

27:44.360 --> 27:48.149
Agent DiPierro, I'm sorry to interrupt.
You should see this.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.996
<i>Chaos and sadness
in Tribeca tonight</i>

27:51.080 --> 27:53.879
<i>following a report
of an apparent suicide jumper.</i>

27:54.040 --> 27:55.872
You met with him today,
didn't you?

27:56.360 --> 27:58.636
Did he seem upset
or worried or...

27:59.920 --> 28:01.400
What are you
talking about?

28:01.480 --> 28:04.632
They haven't publicly released
the name, but it's Agent Horton.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.480
From the Santiago case.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.280
<i>A spokesperson from the New York
Fire Department has confirmed</i>

28:09.360 --> 28:11.636
<i>that a middle-aged man
died on impact</i>

28:11.720 --> 28:14.554
<i>when he jumped from
an eighth-floor apartment window...</i>

28:28.960 --> 28:30.519
It's gone.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.640
What?

28:32.720 --> 28:34.996
The safe deposit box.
It's gone.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.151
Payment lapsed
two years ago.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.274
We tried contacting
the account owner, your mother,

28:40.360 --> 28:41.953
but never heard back.

28:42.040 --> 28:47.115
It's policy to dispose of the contents
after a 120-day grace period.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.119
You threw away
my mom's shit?

28:52.080 --> 28:54.959
It's policy.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.191
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

29:04.840 --> 29:10.074
I'll, uh,
give you a few minutes.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.997
This is ridiculous.
Let's go.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.671
We still have to pick up
her fucking ashes.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.160
What's going on?

29:53.240 --> 29:55.197
You didn't even know
what was in there.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.238
Don't you get it, Elliot?

29:59.320 --> 30:00.674
It's not about
the fucking box.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.831
It's about the fact
that you don't give a shit!

30:03.280 --> 30:05.237
About Mom?
Fucking sue me for

30:05.320 --> 30:06.896
not giving a shit about her
after what she did to us.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.355
Not Mom. Angela.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.194
You were right.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.114
She's gone.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.718
I mean,
how do you do it?

30:30.360 --> 30:32.477
How do you just
move on like that?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.600
I haven't.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.069
What are you doing?

30:54.160 --> 30:55.230
Open it.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.400
You recognize that tape?

31:10.840 --> 31:12.320
How did Mom get this?

31:13.800 --> 31:14.995
No idea.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.919
This wasn't for her.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.672
Maybe she wished
it were.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.917
Why would she
even listen to it?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.114
She was lonely.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.074
What are you doing?

31:42.160 --> 31:43.674
I'm gonna listen to it.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.633
And you're gonna
listen with me.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.475
I can't.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.440
Come on.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.875
<i>Okay.</i>

32:38.960 --> 32:40.633
<i>We're live.
Ready, Angela?</i>

32:40.720 --> 32:42.200
<i>Okay. Ready.</i>

32:42.280 --> 32:45.717
<i>Okay.
Three, two, one.</i>

32:45.800 --> 32:47.598
<i>Good morning,
Washington Township.</i>

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
<i>We are your hosts,</i>

32:48.760 --> 32:51.070
<i>Elliot Alderson
and Darlene Alderson,</i>

32:51.160 --> 32:54.551
<i>and Angela Moss.
We're here to say... Ready?</i>

32:54.680 --> 32:57.673
<i>Happy Mother's Day,
Mrs. Moss!</i>

32:57.760 --> 32:59.956
<i>Happy Mother's Day, Mom!
I love you.</i>

33:00.080 --> 33:01.760
<i>We love you, too!</i>

33:20.040 --> 33:21.997
You're a little
unbalanced.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.920
The tree.

33:36.920 --> 33:40.231
Yes. To the left.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.358
Happy holidays, Phillip.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.799
I was pleased
you reached out,

33:47.920 --> 33:51.152
having been so quiet
these past few months.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.273
Is that why you're here?

33:55.920 --> 33:57.400
To make an attempt...

33:57.480 --> 34:02.032
Look, it would be a waste of both our times
to speculate on why I'm here.

34:02.120 --> 34:05.272
The truth is simple,
let's give that a shot.

34:07.040 --> 34:12.831
I'm resigning as CEO of E Corp
by end of year.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.554
Which means, of course, I'll be parting ways
with the Deus Group, as well.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.954
Well, that is obviously
unacceptable.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.630
Your tenure at E Corp
will be over soon enough,

34:34.760 --> 34:36.558
but you will simply
have to wait.

34:36.639 --> 34:40.679
Nothing can rock the boat now,
as my project has not yet shipped.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.438
Yes. Yes, I understand.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.351
But here's the thing.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.154
I don't care.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.277
Do not forget
your loyalty.

35:12.640 --> 35:17.271
My loyalty has been
unquestionable.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.995
You've taken nearly everything
from me.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.909
I'd like to leave
with what little I have left.

35:27.560 --> 35:31.554
You know that in order for me
to replace you as CEO,

35:31.880 --> 35:36.079
the Deus Group members must
all agree on your successor,

35:36.840 --> 35:38.160
in person.

35:39.760 --> 35:44.630
Well, perhaps a New Year's celebration
will befit this fresh start.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.399
Your request is absurd.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.520
You know we can't organize

35:48.560 --> 35:50.153
a meeting within
the next week.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.233
And yet, I have faith
you'll find a way.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.319
That is not how this
fucking game is played!

36:02.160 --> 36:03.389
"Game."

36:04.840 --> 36:06.718
Game. That word.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.313
There's our problem.

36:10.760 --> 36:15.039
There's an endpoint.
There must be, eventually...

36:15.800 --> 36:17.757
And I've reached mine.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.111
Since the game is
what you care about,

36:21.560 --> 36:23.472
you should be happy.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.960
You won.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Hello?

37:01.600 --> 37:03.319
<i>I played my hand.</i>

37:05.520 --> 37:06.520
And?

37:07.400 --> 37:10.791
<i>And, now we wait.</i>

37:13.760 --> 37:15.080
Thank you.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.434
<i>Don't thank me.</i>

37:19.880 --> 37:21.633
<i>I'm not doing this for you.</i>

37:26.080 --> 37:28.834
You ready?
I've got Mom's ashes.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.594
Who was that?

37:34.680 --> 37:35.909
No one.

37:40.240 --> 37:44.075
I saw your phone earlier
when we were here,

37:44.760 --> 37:46.877
and on the train platform.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.718
Why are you hacking
Susan Jacobs' Ecoin wallet?

38:03.080 --> 38:04.480
Why do you care?

38:05.840 --> 38:07.274
Because I do.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.436
Why?

38:16.360 --> 38:17.840
I knew her.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.677
The last transaction
in her Ecoin wallet...

38:39.760 --> 38:41.558
At the animal shelter?

38:50.480 --> 38:52.073
What about it?

38:56.560 --> 38:57.994
That wasn't her.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.035
It was me.

39:08.480 --> 39:12.838
It was you who
broke into her house.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.191
You were in jail.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.590
fsociety needed
a new base.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.278
But she caught you.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.636
She was supposed to
be out of town.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.200
Darlene...

39:40.960 --> 39:42.440
What did you do?

39:46.240 --> 39:48.072
What, you want me
to say it?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.917
Jesus fucking Christ!

39:57.240 --> 39:58.754
I knew
you wouldn't get it.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.674
Then why did you tell me?

40:05.400 --> 40:06.993
I guess,
I had to know.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.840
Know what?

40:12.560 --> 40:14.677
That we'd still be okay...

40:16.520 --> 40:18.239
Even if you knew
what I did.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.631
I read what she did.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.196
The Washington Township case.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.275
I need everything you have
on Susan Jacobs.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.440
Why?

41:15.840 --> 41:19.197
Susan Jacobs was also
working for the Dark Army.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.718
And what does that have
to do with you?

41:36.760 --> 41:38.797
I'm going after Whiterose.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.557
You know
that's suicide, right?

41:51.040 --> 41:52.040
Probably.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.513
And you're gonna
do it anyway.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.720
Why not give up?

42:02.320 --> 42:05.631
I can't.
She'll find me.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.352
Us. She'll find us both.
That's why you're doing this.

42:21.240 --> 42:22.435
I'm in.

42:23.680 --> 42:27.594
No. This is exactly why I didn't
tell you in the first place.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.593
I'm not giving you
a choice.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.640
Besides, you need me.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.630
Face it.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.792
Every hack you've ever pulled off
is because fsociety helped you,

42:36.880 --> 42:39.349
and right now,
we're all that's left.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.470
Okay? If this is the biggest
thing you're ever gonna do,

42:44.240 --> 42:45.754
we're doing it together.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.789
Give me your phone.

42:59.760 --> 43:04.277
I rigged Signal's API to beam GPS coords
so we can share locations.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.678
That way if you're ever worried about me,
you'll know where I am.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.714
It's done. Okay, I'm in whether
you like it or not.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.816
To be honest, I wasn't expecting
you to say Whiterose.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.514
I mean, I knew you were
up to something,

43:21.600 --> 43:23.831
but you were acting like such
a total sketchball,

43:23.920 --> 43:25.673
I figured it had to
do with Vera.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.275
Vera?

43:31.360 --> 43:33.480
What are you... What does he
have to do with anything?

43:33.520 --> 43:34.874
Well, that's what
I was wondering.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.633
I mean, he freaked me
the fuck out

43:36.720 --> 43:38.736
when he showed up at your
building a couple months ago.

43:38.760 --> 43:44.074
But when I told you, you just
blew it off like it was no big deal.

43:52.120 --> 43:55.750
I don't need to worry
about him, do I?

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
No.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.714
You should get going.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.591
Pull everything you have
on Susan.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.589
Are you coming?

44:19.440 --> 44:20.715
I'll be right there.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.637
Elliot. Thanks...

44:27.880 --> 44:29.200
For today.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.113
I don't know what
Darlene is talking about.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.640
Price made his move.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.518
We might actually
have a shot at Whiterose.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.354
But none of that matters,
because I can't fucking trust you!

44:47.440 --> 44:49.352
Listen to me! I don't know
anything about Vera.

44:49.440 --> 44:53.070
You heard what she said.
She told one of us, and it wasn't me.

44:53.160 --> 44:55.038
There's no reason for me
to keep that from you.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.999
Fuck it! You wanna go back
to not talking to each other,

44:58.080 --> 45:00.515
blocking each other out,
fighting for control...

45:00.600 --> 45:01.600
Look at me.

45:02.120 --> 45:04.476
I am telling you
the truth.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.632
I am not the one
Darlene talked to.

45:17.160 --> 45:20.471
If it wasn't you,
and it wasn't me...

45:23.040 --> 45:24.440
Who was it?

46:12.240 --> 46:13.913
I've been looking
all over for you.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.080
You shouldn't be sitting there.
That's not your seat.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.156
- Why? I thought...
- They're not ready yet.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.200
We need to wait.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.280
For what?

46:28.200 --> 46:29.350
For him.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.593
You mean Mr. Robot?

46:33.160 --> 46:34.355
No.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.070
Elliot?

46:36.560 --> 46:37.560
No.

46:39.600 --> 46:40.875
The other one.
