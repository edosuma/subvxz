00:09.593 --> 00:12.388
Hello.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.098
Yeah.

00:14.306 --> 00:17.351
Uh, we're going to go
on a mission right now.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.812
Uh, so will you come with me?

00:22.648 --> 00:23.691
Oh.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.026
You will.

00:32.575 --> 00:33.993
So I'm going down
the street, and I get a hit.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.620
Heath, Heath, Heath...

00:36.829 --> 00:38.914
and, sure enough,
the next day, I said,

00:39.123 --> 00:40.249
"I'm going to hear about
something...Heath.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.208
There's something going on."

00:41.417 --> 00:42.543
The next day, I got your email.

00:45.546 --> 00:50.718
I honestly think
that the earth is off axis.

00:50.926 --> 00:51.886
I think there's something

00:52.094 --> 00:57.433
that is universally
out of alignment...

00:57.641 --> 00:58.809
with what happened.

00:59.018 --> 01:02.730
I'm not supposed to be
talking about this with you.

01:02.938 --> 01:03.814
This is...

01:04.022 --> 01:05.691
This isn't supposed
to be being made.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.443
This is fucked up.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.944
Like, this is not something

01:09.153 --> 01:10.946

to be happening right now.

If there wasn't a risk,
some type of risk involved,

01:26.045 --> 01:28.130

01:29.673 --> 01:32.009

had this vision

02:02.623 --> 02:03.999
as to where he was going to be.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.877
He had these little shiny stars
on the ceiling

02:07.086 --> 02:08.336
that he put up
in this old house.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.923
He said, you know,
"That's where I'm going to be."

02:11.132 --> 02:13.843
He said, "I'm going
to be in the film industry,"

02:14.051 --> 02:15.553
and he said, "I'm going
to be a film actor."

02:17.555 --> 02:18.347
Heath used to follow

02:18.556 --> 02:19.682
his sister Kate, you know,

02:19.890 --> 02:22.226
all her productions
that she was at at school.

Heath being in the front row
like this, for every single one.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.190
"That's what I want to do.

02:28.399 --> 02:29.400
I can't wait
'til I can do that."

02:32.570 --> 02:34.029
He excelled
in everything he did.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.448
Chess was his biggest passion.

amazing athlete...

02:46.584 --> 02:47.918
Heath used to get into scraps.

02:48.127 --> 02:48.794
He was a good fighter.

02:51.714 --> 02:53.132
I remember the conversations

02:53.340 --> 02:54.842
about Heath wanting
to leave school

02:55.050 --> 02:56.760
and travel across Australia.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.846
I was quite shocked
at the time because he was 17.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.348
It was like trying
to settle a wild stallion

03:01.557 --> 03:02.474
at the time.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.476
You may as well
make a friend of them

03:04.685 --> 03:07.021
and support them
as best you can and love them,

03:07.229 --> 03:09.148
and let's hope
that everything turns out.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.193
I've got nothing
to run away from in Perth.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.277
I love my family.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.196
I love my friends.
I love the city.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.073
It's just there was all this
going on outside of that,

03:18.282 --> 03:19.658
and I just had to be part of it.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.660
Heath and Trevor,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.037
they were out
to conquer the world,

03:23.245 --> 03:24.622
the two of them.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.499
Pretty much waited for the day
for me to finish school,

03:27.708 --> 03:29.126
and he was like,
"Let's go to Sydney."

03:31.045 --> 03:32.630
It was literally
jumping in our car

03:32.838 --> 03:35.341
and planting the foot down
and just bolting out.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.927

to all these auditions,

03:54.235 --> 03:55.319
all these interviews...

03:55.527 --> 03:56.987
Never asked.
He just did it.

03:57.196 --> 04:00.241
He got a role
in an American TV series, Roar.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.034
He had the lead role.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.244

04:04.828 --> 04:05.871
Great. Cut!

04:06.080 --> 04:07.539
Now he's an actor.
It was serious.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.916
We went to the Gold Coast.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.252
We were put up in a two-
bedroom high-rise apartment

04:11.460 --> 04:12.628
overlooking the ocean.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.089
Money, as a 17-year-old,
was impressive.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.339
"Wow, here we are."

Lisa was a real woman,

04:21.928 --> 04:23.889
very classy.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.557
He looked up to her.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.475
They fell in love
really quickly.

04:26.684 --> 04:27.601
She guided him.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.061

the potential in him.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.521
Lisa, where are we going?

04:30.729 --> 04:33.607
She took his hand
and opened a lot of doors.

04:33.816 --> 04:34.733
He followed her from Australia.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.443
She was, like, "Come to L.A."

05:10.519 --> 05:12.229

05:14.565 --> 05:16.692
Heath arrived at some odd hour,

05:16.900 --> 05:19.737
and he turns around
and looks at me with a big smile

05:19.945 --> 05:21.530
and says "Hello!"

05:21.739 --> 05:22.698
Of course,
the first thing I noticed

05:22.906 --> 05:24.992
was his gigantic smile.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.371
My roommate, Lisa Zane,
knew, in her words,

05:29.580 --> 05:30.622
that he was going to clean up,

05:30.831 --> 05:33.542
meaning
be successful in Hollywood.

05:33.751 --> 05:36.045
I think
she was the first to know that.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.382
Hello.
How was your day?

05:40.591 --> 05:41.925
Oh, it was fun.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.512
There's a book called
The Sentimental Education,

05:45.721 --> 05:49.350
and I feel
that's what he got from Lisa.

05:52.728 --> 05:55.606
Lisa took him
to the Venice Carnevale...

05:58.025 --> 05:59.568
and they shot
8-millimeter film...

06:01.695 --> 06:03.614
and would wear the costumes...

06:05.741 --> 06:06.909
and, to me,

06:07.117 --> 06:08.827
that was a part of what
created him as an actor.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.957
I gave him my friend's script,
10 Things I Hate About You.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.754
He read the script and said,

06:18.962 --> 06:21.048
"I really like
the role of Patrick,"

06:21.256 --> 06:23.509
and I said,
"Isn't Patrick the lead?"

06:23.717 --> 06:26.720
He said,
"Yes, Patrick's the lead,

06:26.929 --> 06:28.514
and that's the part I want,"

06:28.722 --> 06:31.308
and when he came back
from the audition,

06:31.517 --> 06:33.852
he said, "I got Patrick,"

06:34.061 --> 06:36.939
and I was like, "Really?
You got the lead?"

06:37.147 --> 06:41.777
and that's when I realized
that Heath was...

06:41.985 --> 06:42.778
different.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.446
No offence or anything.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.240
I mean, I know everyone
digs your sister,

06:46.448 --> 06:48.409
but, um...

06:48.617 --> 06:49.284
she's without.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.340
Maybe we should do
this another time.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.773
Sometimes
people break through

07:19.982 --> 07:21.775
because of one thing,

07:21.984 --> 07:24.403
whether it's good looks
or talent or timing or...

07:24.611 --> 07:25.904
you know, who knows,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.282
but he sort of had
everything down.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.203
One of the most powerful things
for an actor,

07:33.412 --> 07:34.997
particularly for a man,
is their voice...

07:35.205 --> 07:36.540
I've thrown a football, what,

07:36.748 --> 07:37.833
a few times in my life, so...

07:38.041 --> 07:40.002
And their physicality...

07:40.210 --> 07:42.671
And their, you know,
level of masculinity,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.840
and he had all of those things
in spades.

07:53.682 --> 07:54.933
There was a bunch of kids

07:55.142 --> 07:56.185
staying in a hotel.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.020
Everyone had their own suites,

07:58.228 --> 07:59.480
and he brought everyone
together,

07:59.688 --> 08:02.357
so by the time I got there,
the parties were in his room.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.068
10 Things
was when he really felt

08:05.277 --> 08:07.529
that, "Okay, this is my career.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.198
I'm an actor now."

08:11.116 --> 08:13.243
By then,
he had his agent, Steve.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.411
He knew the industry,

08:14.620 --> 08:15.829
but he didn't really
know the industry.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.582
He'd only been in it
for 18 months.

08:20.626 --> 08:21.710
It was
pretty early in my career.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.004
You know, he was
one of my early clients.

08:24.213 --> 08:27.549
He was looking for people
that he could trust.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.094
Home to sleep.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.725
It was just obvious.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.936
He just had
this great swagger about him.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.438
So how long have
you been acting?

08:41.647 --> 08:43.232
About...

08:44.399 --> 08:45.901
20 years.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.570
How old are you?

08:48.779 --> 08:49.947
20.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.616
You could tell we were going
to be on to something.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.076
So one of the things
that happens

08:54.284 --> 08:56.912
is when you're good
at something in a movie,

08:57.120 --> 08:59.331
everyone offers you
that same thing.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.667
So he did a great job

09:01.875 --> 09:04.962
being in a teen romantic
comedy, basically,

09:05.170 --> 09:07.172
and so anything that, you know,

09:07.381 --> 09:09.299
sort of resembled
10 Things I Hate About You

09:09.508 --> 09:10.884
came his way,

09:11.093 --> 09:14.805
and, of course, that's exactly
what he didn't want to do next.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.516
He wanted to mix it up
and find a new challenge.

09:19.309 --> 09:23.063
That moment
was a very important next step.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.107
"Okay, what do we want
to do next?

09:25.315 --> 09:28.610
What do we really want to do
if we have a choice?"

09:28.819 --> 09:31.071
People in Hollywood,
they don't like to hear "no,"

09:31.280 --> 09:32.489
you know...

09:32.698 --> 09:35.409
and so I had a lot of fun
saying "no."

09:35.617 --> 09:36.702
He was always very friendly.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.122
He never seemed
out of sorts about it,

09:40.330 --> 09:42.165
but he knew what he didn't want.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.960
He was always very appreciative

09:45.168 --> 09:49.381
of coming to a house
full of art and artists.

09:51.717 --> 09:52.759
I am filming
right now.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.307
He got this camera,

09:58.515 --> 10:01.143
and he didn't know what to do
other than to make something.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.604
It wasn't just to film us
and film what we were doing.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.941
He was, like, creating
something straight away.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.446
He always used to say to me,
"Don't forget your camera,"

10:12.654 --> 10:14.698
and I was like, "What am I going
to film between here and there?"

10:14.906 --> 10:18.076
and he was like, "I don't care.
You could film your feet."

10:18.285 --> 10:20.912
But we'd watch
a lot of our videos back.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.749
He was just... curious,
and watching it, and, like,

10:23.957 --> 10:25.375
thinking how
he could do things different.

10:26.918 --> 10:27.669
That's how he learned.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.046
He never studied...

10:29.254 --> 10:30.756
anything, really.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.175
He was self-taught.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.093
He could really see
what he was doing

10:35.302 --> 10:37.346
and how to do that better
or different...

10:38.472 --> 10:39.640
Hmm.

10:39.848 --> 10:40.849
Even if it
was the way he smiled

10:41.058 --> 10:42.100
or where he was looking,

10:42.309 --> 10:45.103
he'd make a lot of things
just for himself,

10:45.312 --> 10:46.563
just to teach himself.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.317
That's right...

10:50.525 --> 10:52.194
<i>And evil
super-villains.</i>

10:52.402 --> 10:53.695

10:53.904 --> 10:55.072

Okay, I've got my mission.

11:04.790 --> 11:05.874
We're at the peephole.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.961
You never know
who's out there waiting.

11:10.170 --> 11:10.962
Okay.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.390
Hey.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.230
Did they know?

12:25.162 --> 12:28.707
Okay, he's not there.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.125
Let's keep on looking.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.002
Down here.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.338
Good Lord.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.923
It was an effort.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.258
Thank God I made it.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.594
What's this? A message?

13:22.803 --> 13:24.513
It must be from him.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.306
Oh, my God...

13:44.074 --> 13:47.410
The screen test for The Patriot
came up with Mel Gibson,

13:47.619 --> 13:49.913
who's the biggest
Australian movie star.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.915
That was one of his idols,

13:52.123 --> 13:54.793
and he loved,
you know, Mad Max and...

13:55.001 --> 13:57.796
It was a huge,
huge thing for him.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.049
It was an actual screen test
and costume on the set

14:01.258 --> 14:02.384
with the main star.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.720
I was halfway
through the second scene

14:05.929 --> 14:07.138
that I had to read for them,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.683
and words were just bluhblbl,
coming out like this,

14:09.891 --> 14:12.853
and so I just stopped
and stood up

14:13.061 --> 14:14.104
and I said, "I'm sorry.
I'm wasting your time."

14:14.312 --> 14:17.107
Heath called me and said,

14:17.315 --> 14:18.733
"They're not calling you
on this one.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.569
I just didn't do well,"

14:20.777 --> 14:22.988
and it was something,
enough there

14:23.196 --> 14:25.866
that Roland Emmerich
and the studio and Mel

14:26.074 --> 14:28.410
all looked at each other
and, I think, said,

14:28.618 --> 14:29.953
"You know, let's take a shot."

14:32.038 --> 14:35.292
So this is, um,
first day shooting.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.793
This is the first day
on The Patriot for me.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.295
I'm looking forward to it.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.380
It's been three months since
I found out I got this job,

14:40.589 --> 14:43.008
and finally, after three months
of sitting around

14:43.216 --> 14:44.092
thinking about it,

14:44.301 --> 14:45.635
I get to go out there
and do it.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.220
This is it.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.016
So...

14:51.224 --> 14:52.893
Blink my eyes,
and it'll be out there.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.314
Guys, guys,
Heath's here, guys.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.356
Everybody look alive.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.490
It was a huge production.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.369
It was a little terrifying

15:11.578 --> 15:14.331
to be in another city
with no friends,

15:14.539 --> 15:17.042
and you're just sitting there
on your own.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.628
It's a lonely life.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.879
Cut.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.797
That's why he took me
to most places

15:23.006 --> 15:24.174
is that it was us.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.511
Hee hee hee hee.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.598
We met riding our bikes

15:31.806 --> 15:32.682
out in the street,

15:32.891 --> 15:35.644
and we just became
best friends.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.147
We felt...
at home together.

15:39.356 --> 15:43.193
You could tell that he was...
he wanted to do a good job.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.572
He was still learning.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.916
I'm not going back.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.252
No, I didn't
expect you would.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.676
That Gates is a damn fool.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
He spent too many years
in the British army.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.516
Going muzzle to muzzle with
Redcoats in open field...

16:14.724 --> 16:15.850
it's madness.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.103
He called me one day
from the set,

16:18.311 --> 16:19.896
really upset.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.111
He was having a hard time,
and he was struggling,

16:26.319 --> 16:28.613
just a crisis of confidence.

16:37.872 --> 16:38.790
He was probably, in his head,

16:38.999 --> 16:40.500
he's standing across
from his idol,

16:40.709 --> 16:42.794
acting with Mel Gibson.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.255
For a young Aussie kid,
it was a lot.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.217
He would get caught up
in the fear

16:49.426 --> 16:51.428
of whether or not
he could accomplish

16:51.636 --> 16:53.847
what he wanted to do.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.849
He kind of almost pulled out
of every movie

16:56.057 --> 16:58.309
he ever ended up doing.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.107
It's kind of
a rule of thumb for me

17:04.315 --> 17:05.942
to self-doubt,

17:06.151 --> 17:07.318
always think
that I shouldn't be doing it,

17:07.527 --> 17:08.444
and I don't know how to do it,

17:08.653 --> 17:10.363
and I'm going to fail,

17:10.571 --> 17:12.490
and that I fooled them,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.992
and I always try
and find a way out.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.999
And he got past it,

17:21.207 --> 17:21.915
and Mel was great.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.334
Mel was so generous with him

17:23.542 --> 17:24.711
and really took him
under his wing

17:24.919 --> 17:26.963
and was amazing.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.173
I'm sorry.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.716
Be quiet.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.926
I'll take care of you.
You're going to be all right.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.470
Father...

17:35.638 --> 17:39.267
I'm sorry... about Thomas.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.773
Mel really taught him

17:44.981 --> 17:46.191
how to come in and out
of a character.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.613
He definitely learned
how to relax a little,

17:51.821 --> 17:53.782
rather than building himself
up of, like,

17:53.990 --> 17:56.451
"I've got this scene,
and I've got to do this."

17:58.369 --> 18:01.790
I think Mel was
the first teacher that he had.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.209
Heath used to say to me,
"It's not what Mel says.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.335
It's what he doesn't say."

18:14.844 --> 18:16.096
It's good.
I'm happy to be finished.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.597
It was long.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.391
It was really fun, though,
and they're really great people,

18:20.600 --> 18:24.562
and I'm going to catch
a plane in two hours.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.190
Mel had said,
"Well, I'm taking my jet.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.358
Do you guys want
to come with me?"

18:28.566 --> 18:30.860
Mel Gibson's inviting us
on his jet...

18:34.739 --> 18:35.740
and, all of a sudden,
there we are,

18:35.949 --> 18:37.909
with Mel on his jet,

18:38.118 --> 18:40.370
cruising back to L.A.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.413
It was definitely,
definitely a moment.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.682
So we were always
going on adventures

19:00.890 --> 19:02.725
and looking
for the next adventure

19:02.934 --> 19:04.561
that was exciting and fun.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.149
He'd finished a film.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.275
He had downtime.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.068
We went to Burning Man in '99.

19:20.994 --> 19:21.703
Oh, cool.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.418
We were excited

19:28.626 --> 19:30.003
because we knew
nothing about it.

19:31.171 --> 19:31.796
Cool.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.635
The creativity
that exists there

19:37.844 --> 19:40.638
and the ability to ride bikes
morning, noon, and night...

19:42.265 --> 19:43.183
I think Burning Man

19:43.391 --> 19:44.726
was Heath's favorite place
on Earth.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.356
Do you want
a whiskey, Trevor?

19:50.565 --> 19:51.232
I'd love a whiskey.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.026
Whiskey.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.987
Whiskey and hot dogs.
Nice.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.323
It was a bunch
of half-naked people

19:58.531 --> 20:00.617
and dance music 24-7,

20:00.825 --> 20:04.329
and we fit in really well.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.047
Heath lived every moment
to the fullest.

20:20.345 --> 20:24.766
He was always looking to create
something out of the situation.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.231
Cool...

20:31.439 --> 20:32.523
You see?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.403
He was an artist.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.656
He loved to paint.
He loved to draw.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.742
Cameras
were a big passion of his.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.869
He knew the lighting
that was available.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.789
He knew the speed of the film
that was in his camera

20:47.997 --> 20:50.667
and what he could set it at
without using a light meter.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.630
The cameras were a part of him.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.313
Heath and I
had mutual friends,

21:12.522 --> 21:13.398
so it was a setup.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.109
We met,

21:16.317 --> 21:18.027
and that was it.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.028
That was it.

21:20.488 --> 21:24.284
There were always
cameras around...

21:24.492 --> 21:25.618
a video camera,

21:25.827 --> 21:28.997
or a Polaroid camera,
or the film camera.

21:29.205 --> 21:32.750
I was amazed when I saw
all of the stuff together...

21:35.044 --> 21:37.171
and how many photographs...

21:37.380 --> 21:39.674
I mean, he was
documenting everything.

21:41.759 --> 21:42.677
He was just surrounded

21:42.885 --> 21:46.264
by all of those moments
he was in,

21:46.472 --> 21:47.765
and then surrounded by them,

21:47.974 --> 21:49.684
but then he'd be capturing
the next moment

21:49.892 --> 21:52.437
and the next moment, you know,
and the next moment.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.565
Didn't stop.
It never stopped...

21:59.944 --> 22:02.864
and the way
he was able to be in the moment

22:03.072 --> 22:05.450
and then capture the moment
on the camera...

22:07.118 --> 22:12.290
He just got you
in your most authentic self.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.375
You know, he really got me.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.170
I think that's a beautiful thing

22:17.378 --> 22:20.298
because he's saying, you know,
through his photographs,

22:20.506 --> 22:22.133
"I see you."

22:25.219 --> 22:28.806
The art was more of a need,
almost,

22:29.015 --> 22:33.394
to live in the world
and then capture the world.

22:33.603 --> 22:37.398
He would draw on it
or scratch on it

22:37.607 --> 22:39.317
or use crayon or nail polish.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.905
He wanted to take it all
with him.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.748
That's the only way
I think of him,

22:53.956 --> 22:55.375
with the camera
in the hand.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.088
That was just Heath.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.386
His mates from Perth,

23:06.594 --> 23:08.679
they were
a very close, warm,

23:08.888 --> 23:13.101
loving, you know,
tight group of friends,

23:13.309 --> 23:16.896
and he loved
having them around.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.565
Okay, so I take the 101 south.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.692
He had, like,
15 years of friendship

23:21.901 --> 23:24.529
with kids that we went
to kindergarten with

23:24.737 --> 23:26.197
that we'd graduated
high school with.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.658
Heath always kept them close.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.161
I was privileged
enough to go over

23:32.370 --> 23:35.123
and see how his life was,

23:35.331 --> 23:37.250
and it was
incredibly enticing,

23:37.458 --> 23:38.584
incredibly alluring.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.420
Oh, my goodness,
this has to be, like,

23:40.628 --> 23:43.089
the world
that everyone wants to live.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.674
Kane Manera
from The Strokes...

23:46.259 --> 23:47.510
I think it was the first trip,

23:47.718 --> 23:48.886
driving around, and he says,

23:49.095 --> 23:50.096
"I've got to go
to a friend's house."

23:50.304 --> 23:51.556
Knock on the door,

23:51.764 --> 23:52.640
and he's got this, like,

23:52.849 --> 23:56.185
slightly cheeky look
on his face.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.186
Door opens.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.897
Naomi Campbell answers.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.024
I still have Naomi Campbell
pictures on my wall

24:02.233 --> 24:03.151
at this point.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.237
So I'm doing my best job
of just...

24:07.572 --> 24:09.031
"Hey, how are ya?
Nice to meet you,"

24:09.240 --> 24:10.032
and I'm thinking,

24:10.241 --> 24:11.075
"I guess
this is what Heath does.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.535
This is how it is now.

24:12.743 --> 24:13.953
Just rolls
to Naomi Campbell's house."

24:17.498 --> 24:19.041
Heath! Heath!

24:22.628 --> 24:24.839
Heath's place was renowned

24:25.047 --> 24:27.758
for having a stream

24:27.967 --> 24:30.011
of Australian actors
and whatnots

24:30.219 --> 24:31.053
living there.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.014
Casting directors would ask you,

24:33.222 --> 24:36.184
"And are you one of the Aussies
that lives at Heath's place?"

24:37.852 --> 24:41.939
Yeah, we lived
in Los Feliz in this house

24:42.148 --> 24:43.941
where the doors were just open,

24:44.150 --> 24:46.194
and people would come
and stay.

24:46.402 --> 24:50.615
Joel Edgerton and Heath
were close friends early on,

24:50.823 --> 24:52.867
and he came over,
and Martin Henderson...

24:53.075 --> 24:54.118
I did.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.286
Rose Byrne,

24:55.495 --> 24:57.455
Gregor Jordan,
you know, the director...

24:57.663 --> 24:59.582
You would never know
who's staying at Heath's house.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.752
Everyone and anyone
was welcome, you know?

25:02.960 --> 25:05.588
He had such generosity
of spirit.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.591
It's just miraculous,
the energy...

25:08.799 --> 25:10.801
him, arms open, as always.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.471
The Australian thing,
to me, was like,

25:13.679 --> 25:14.972
yeah, come one, come all,
you know?

25:15.181 --> 25:16.307
Like, hang out.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.309
Let's make this fun.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.686
People would stay a long time,
sometimes.

25:20.895 --> 25:21.687
It was...

25:21.896 --> 25:23.314
a bit longer than necessary,

25:23.523 --> 25:24.941
but, um, but it was fun.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.069
You've flown around the world.

25:28.277 --> 25:31.906
Staying somewhere in L.A.
for a couple of months?

25:32.114 --> 25:34.492
That... phew... costs a lot,

25:34.700 --> 25:39.455
and I had nothing going on
work-wise.

25:39.664 --> 25:40.456
Nothing.

25:40.665 --> 25:42.166
It sort of didn't matter.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.337
Upstairs, they had
a couple turntables.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.755
They had a DJ setup.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.632
"Come in.
We're going to do this.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.801
What do you feel like?
Just chill out.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.302
Oh, this is my record room.
This is the sunroom.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.763
Have you heard of Nick Drake?
You've got to listen to this."

25:55.972 --> 25:57.598
Puts it on, boom....

25:57.807 --> 26:00.434
At his house,
he had a big record collection,

26:00.643 --> 26:01.686
and he could have a big party,

26:01.894 --> 26:04.355
and he would always be
at the music.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.149
Music was definitely something
that was in him

26:07.358 --> 26:08.859
that he... he loved.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.906
With him, it was just
friends to hang out with

26:14.115 --> 26:17.243
and share the journey.

26:17.451 --> 26:21.330
He was very big
on sharing his success.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.374
Heath's place
in L.A. was sort of

26:23.583 --> 26:27.545
a renowned pre-Entourage
kind of entourage house.

26:27.753 --> 26:31.132
In fact,
when I was staying there,

26:31.340 --> 26:34.969
Adrian Grenier was there
at one of these nights.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.972
There was a bit of drinking
and carrying on going on.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.599
Then I often fancy

26:39.807 --> 26:42.768
that he was doing
a bit of research

26:42.977 --> 26:45.938
on a functioning entourage,

26:46.147 --> 26:47.732
'cause Heath wasn't there,

26:47.940 --> 26:49.775
so, you know, "Vinnie,"
as it were,

26:49.984 --> 26:51.402
would've been away
making a film.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.577
There were times
people were there, he wasn't.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.370
I mean, he was on a set
somewhere, working on a movie,

27:01.579 --> 27:02.413
you know, in Europe,

27:02.622 --> 27:04.498
and his house was full.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.161
We were in Prague.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.038
For the first time,
we're really in Europe,

27:44.246 --> 27:45.623
and we're living there.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.709
We're there for pre-production.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.505
Knight's Tale

27:52.713 --> 27:54.674
was an interesting moment
in his career.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.258
Amy Pascal, who runs Sony
at the time,

27:56.467 --> 27:59.970
really, really loved Heath
and appreciated him

28:00.179 --> 28:01.514
and wanted him in everything.

28:03.766 --> 28:04.809
Hyah!

28:05.017 --> 28:05.893
Forward!

28:06.102 --> 28:07.269
Hyah!

28:16.278 --> 28:19.323
Heath really gave
an incredible amount of dignity

28:19.532 --> 28:20.574
to his characters,

28:20.783 --> 28:24.078
even in a film
that's as sort of whimsical

28:24.286 --> 28:25.079
and light, in its way,

28:25.287 --> 28:26.288
as A Knight's Tale.

28:26.497 --> 28:31.168
It's very hard to be
as solid as he was.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.920
You know, at first,
it was a shock.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.422
You know, I read it.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.508
"Queen, 'We Will Rock You,'
rises as they enter the arena."

28:37.717 --> 28:39.552
I think I almost
closed the script on that line

28:39.760 --> 28:41.512
because I was thinking,
oh, it's one of those movies

28:41.721 --> 28:43.139
that's trying to, you know,
mix the two,

28:43.347 --> 28:46.475
but as I read further into it,
it explained itself.

28:46.684 --> 28:48.519
The rock 'n' roll music
destroys any barriers

28:48.728 --> 28:50.354
that are restricting us
to historical truths.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.148
You know, it's a fairy tale.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.649
We want the audience
to walk in there

28:53.858 --> 28:55.234
and to be transported.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.625
We went to Sony
for a marketing meeting

29:11.834 --> 29:12.877
on A Knight's Tale.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.713
Studio president,
studio executives

29:15.921 --> 29:17.965
were all there, doing their job,

29:18.174 --> 29:19.717
excited about the film,
excited about Heath...

29:19.925 --> 29:20.926
very excited about Heath.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.849
The poster and the campaign
was "He Will Rock You."

29:27.057 --> 29:28.851
It was really built on Heath,

29:29.059 --> 29:31.937
you know, the images,
Heath's face...

29:32.146 --> 29:33.147
he looks like a rock star,

29:33.355 --> 29:34.774
and the tag line,
"He Will Rock You,"

29:34.982 --> 29:36.484
and those posters
were all over the city,

29:36.692 --> 29:38.152
all over Los Angeles.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.488
He was, like,
"Whoa, that's my face."

29:40.696 --> 29:43.073
The posters were everywhere.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.534
He knew
that would be projecting him

29:45.743 --> 29:47.953
into the limelight.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.747
There was a moment

29:49.955 --> 29:52.500
where they talked about Heath
was going to go city by city

29:52.708 --> 29:54.627
and talk about the movie,

29:54.835 --> 29:57.379
and, you know, he was going
to be the secret weapon.

29:57.588 --> 30:03.636
William!

30:07.640 --> 30:11.727
I could see him getting more
and more upset, you know?

30:11.936 --> 30:12.937
We were sitting
next to each other,

30:13.145 --> 30:14.438
and I kinda,
out of the corner of my eye,

30:14.647 --> 30:16.982
could tell he was getting very
uncomfortable and fidgeting,

30:17.191 --> 30:20.027
and he finally whispered to me
that he needed to leave,

30:20.236 --> 30:21.862
he needed to get out
of the room for a second,

30:22.071 --> 30:25.282
"Can you excuse me?"
and he got up.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.284
I followed him.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.161
He was in the bathroom.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.413
...Sitting there
just freaking out,

30:31.622 --> 30:33.582
working out what the hell
he was gonna do,

30:33.791 --> 30:35.042
trying to stick to his guns.

30:37.211 --> 30:38.295
There's this thing
in Australia

30:38.504 --> 30:40.589
called the tall poppy syndrome,
you know?

30:40.798 --> 30:43.634
If one grows too high,
whsst,

30:43.843 --> 30:45.970
you get cut down back to size,

30:46.178 --> 30:49.306
and, as an Australian,
you identify with it.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.725
If you do get too successful,

30:51.934 --> 30:53.018
it's sort of,
there's something that's...

30:53.227 --> 30:54.270
You feel ugly.

30:56.397 --> 30:57.398
Being a salesman

30:57.606 --> 30:58.816
and going out
and talking about the movie

30:59.024 --> 31:00.109
and selling the film,

31:00.317 --> 31:01.944
that was
the part of the business

31:02.152 --> 31:04.446
that I think he was
least comfortable with...

31:04.655 --> 31:06.156
Really, really
had a hard time with.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.701
He wanted fame...

31:08.909 --> 31:10.744
And then when he got it,
he didn't want it.

31:12.371 --> 31:16.083
He was mortified,
and he felt owned.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.668
His image, not their image...

31:17.877 --> 31:20.921
Him, his face,
his heart, his soul.

31:21.130 --> 31:24.341
I remember he told me,
"I'm not gonna be that guy.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.302
I have no interest
in being that guy.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.596
I'm not that guy,
and I'll show you."

31:28.804 --> 31:31.599
Hey, do you
know what you did?

31:31.807 --> 31:33.309
Do you know what you did?

31:33.517 --> 31:35.394
Are you listening to me?

31:35.603 --> 31:37.396
Do you know
what you did?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.273
Do you know what you did?

31:39.481 --> 31:40.608
You fucked him up!

31:40.816 --> 31:44.695
He gets to come in,
play this role,

31:44.904 --> 31:46.155
and break your heart.

31:48.365 --> 31:51.744
In the script Monster's Ball,
he felt there was a journey

31:51.952 --> 31:56.415
that would take him
to another place, another level.

31:56.624 --> 32:02.296
He saw something about himself
that attracted him,

32:02.504 --> 32:04.048
that he wanted
to experiment with,

32:04.256 --> 32:05.966
he wanted to play with,

32:06.175 --> 32:08.886
and that gave him
a perfect opportunity.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.654
He's a supporting role,

32:26.862 --> 32:27.780
but I remember him

32:27.988 --> 32:30.407
more than anything else
in the movie,

32:30.616 --> 32:31.450
and he didn't do much.

32:31.659 --> 32:34.370
He was sort of deadpan,
you know?

32:34.578 --> 32:36.538
He didn't do a lot
of busy performances.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.582
That's the power
of Heath Ledger,

32:38.791 --> 32:42.419
even when he was young,
even as a supporting actor,

32:42.628 --> 32:45.005
he will steal the movie,
steal the whole show.

32:45.214 --> 32:47.925
It sort of turned
things a little bit,

32:48.133 --> 32:51.136
and people viewed him
a slightly different way,

32:51.345 --> 32:53.681
a little bit more
of a dramatic actor.

32:53.889 --> 32:56.475
When I read Spider-Man,
I talked to him about it,

32:56.684 --> 32:58.811
and he was almost immediate
that he said,

32:59.019 --> 33:00.020
"That makes no sense for me.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.564
I can't possibly
be Peter Parker."

33:02.773 --> 33:03.941
He was looking, always,

33:04.149 --> 33:06.568
for something that was
gonna be truly challenging,

33:06.777 --> 33:07.903
to try to figure out ways

33:08.112 --> 33:10.572
that he could absolutely
disappear into a character

33:10.781 --> 33:12.199
and almost be unrecognizable.

33:12.408 --> 33:15.035
That's what really drove him.

33:19.373 --> 33:22.292
In his process of picking
what film he was gonna do,

33:22.501 --> 33:24.378
most of that came
from who was directing it.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.547
Shekhar was a director

33:26.755 --> 33:28.632
that he always wanted
to work with.

33:30.384 --> 33:34.221
He recommended Heath,
myself...

33:34.430 --> 33:38.225
We go out in the desert
by ourselves.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.686
You know, just the two of us.

33:43.731 --> 33:46.900
Heath stood there,
looking down the valley,

33:47.109 --> 33:51.447
and we both
just started yelling,

33:51.655 --> 33:55.784
trying to see how far
your voice will carry.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.578
It's you and the desert.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.039
You're forced
to look at yourself.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.707
The impression
you have of yourself

34:01.915 --> 34:02.875
when you look in the mirror

34:03.083 --> 34:04.334
is up to you.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.046
You can see
whatever you want to see,

34:07.254 --> 34:09.965
and you can be
whoever you want to be.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.969
He was really
at the start of a journey

34:15.179 --> 34:18.139
that was a lot more focused
as an artist.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.518
Acting is learning
about the life around you

34:22.728 --> 34:24.228
and the person you are.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.356
You can learn all the techniques
in the world,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.233
but if you know nothing
about life and yourself,

34:28.442 --> 34:30.652
then you're at a loss.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.196
And since
we have to believe it,

34:32.404 --> 34:34.031
for us, for the audience
to believe

34:34.239 --> 34:36.533
what you're putting out there,

34:36.742 --> 34:39.161
you must believe it yourself.

34:39.369 --> 34:44.333
I will not be responsible
for your death.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.168
How could you be responsible
for my death?

34:51.757 --> 34:54.426
I will die
if it is God's will...

34:55.969 --> 34:57.513
Yes?

34:59.890 --> 35:02.226
That film was a bit
of a soul-searching.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.061
We all grew from that film.

35:05.979 --> 35:09.066
He told me that when
they wrapped his character,

35:09.274 --> 35:12.402
he stood in the middle
of the whole set

35:12.611 --> 35:14.947
and collapsed.

35:27.584 --> 35:30.712
I'd been asked to
do this movie called Ned Kelly.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.589
A small role,

35:32.798 --> 35:36.343
but I was interested
because of Heath.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.388
I thought he was really
a powerful young actor.

35:41.223 --> 35:45.811
I remember the first day on-set,
and I was blown away.

35:46.019 --> 35:49.565
I just felt an incredible
connection very quickly,

35:49.773 --> 35:54.361
so intense that it was
sort of quite shocking.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.535
We connected about acting,

36:01.743 --> 36:03.912
and he saw the work
that I was putting in

36:04.121 --> 36:05.497
and also working
with a dialect coach

36:05.706 --> 36:07.166
and acting coaches,

36:07.374 --> 36:08.584
and he was looking
to change it up.

36:10.544 --> 36:14.464
His approach to his work
was always very intense.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.425
He had the voice down.

36:16.633 --> 36:20.512
He had these sort of
intense eyes.

36:23.223 --> 36:27.519
It takes some real focus
to make that shift

36:27.728 --> 36:30.522
into the world of what
he felt was more artistic.

36:32.941 --> 36:36.486
He really, truly was an artist.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.198
We knew his visual talent
from the photography,

36:39.406 --> 36:42.868
but I didn't know that
it was going to get so serious.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.497
He called me,

36:47.706 --> 36:49.166
and he was like,
"Man, I've got this idea,

36:49.374 --> 36:50.500
and we're gonna
make this video."

36:50.709 --> 36:53.212
I'm thinking,
"You've got so much to do.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.130
How do you have time
to consider me?

36:55.339 --> 36:56.340
How do you have time
to think about this?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.550
How do you even
have the care?"

36:58.759 --> 37:00.010
That's what was going on
in my head

37:00.219 --> 37:01.845
while he's talking me
through this idea.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.223
"How? How do you do this?

37:04.431 --> 37:06.516
How do you stay so active?
How do you stay so interested?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.769
How do you burn so bright
all the time?"

37:08.977 --> 37:10.854
It's just how he always was,

37:11.063 --> 37:13.607
and I was more than happy
to be one of his test subjects

37:13.815 --> 37:15.150
towards becoming a director...

37:15.359 --> 37:16.276
<i>Ca use an effect...</i>

37:16.485 --> 37:17.361
...And let's just do it.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.446
Let's just grab a camera
and shoot.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.077
Okay, let's
do your eye.

37:25.285 --> 37:25.911
All right.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.371
So let's get on with it.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.372
♪ Hum ♪

37:28.580 --> 37:29.498
♪ Hum ♪

37:29.706 --> 37:31.750
♪ Hum hum hum ♪

37:31.959 --> 37:35.003
Yeah.
♪ Hum hum hum hum hum ♪

37:35.212 --> 37:36.463
Let's do it.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.966
Throw ya hands
in the sky with me

37:39.174 --> 37:41.718
Put 'em up like a dirty cop
told ya to freeze

37:41.927 --> 37:43.679
Now close ya hands
to a fist and squeeze

37:43.887 --> 37:46.056
If you represent freedom
and you fight for peace

37:46.265 --> 37:47.182
It's the all-out fallout

37:47.391 --> 37:48.433
I'll come if you call

37:48.642 --> 37:49.601
Run with it quick
I'm fitted fit

37:49.810 --> 37:50.978
More fit than 'em all

37:51.186 --> 37:53.063
More fitter than them
busty booty MILFs at the mall

37:53.272 --> 37:54.147
Milk leakin' out the tit

37:54.356 --> 37:55.524
I pounce quick and I maul

37:55.732 --> 37:57.693
Them baller cats
need to sit back on the bench

37:57.901 --> 38:00.153
N'fa's the fresh breath
amongst the virulent stench

38:00.362 --> 38:01.071
The violence won't end

38:01.280 --> 38:02.489
I document with Biro or pen

38:02.698 --> 38:04.074
Blood leaking
while they're freaking

38:04.283 --> 38:05.575
I'm performing
and trying to take it in

38:05.784 --> 38:07.703
and trying to impress my mate.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.330
Despite who he is to the world,
he's still my mate,

38:10.539 --> 38:12.666
and I'm trying to impress that
and get him going,

38:12.874 --> 38:13.875
and he's getting me going.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.171
Throw ya hands
in the sky with me

38:18.380 --> 38:20.882
Put 'em up like a dirty cop
told ya to freeze

38:21.091 --> 38:22.467
Now close ya hands
to a fist and squeeze

38:22.676 --> 38:25.095
The louder he got,
the more into it I got.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.806
I grab my balls
and I spit on the floor

38:28.015 --> 38:30.058
Throw a fist for freedom
to shock all y'all

38:30.267 --> 38:31.268
No 50/50

38:31.476 --> 38:32.644
If you ain't with me
then fuck all y'all

38:32.853 --> 38:33.812
If ya with me
let me hear ya roar

38:34.021 --> 38:35.105
Come on now

38:35.314 --> 38:36.606
If he wants me
to bark at me what to do,

38:36.815 --> 38:37.733
Imma take it,

38:37.941 --> 38:40.527
because the best guy
in the planet

38:40.736 --> 38:42.529
is telling me how to be better.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.823
If you represent freedom
and you fight for peace

38:45.032 --> 38:46.450
To work with one
of my very best friends

38:46.658 --> 38:47.659
and do something creative,

38:47.868 --> 38:49.286
like, there's not much better
than that.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.413
Now close ya hands
to a fist and squeeze

38:51.621 --> 38:54.041
If you represent freedom
and you fight for peace

39:01.882 --> 39:02.507
It's big today.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.926
They're there, huh?

39:05.135 --> 39:06.178
That's Skip charging.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.896
Shit, dude.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.731
My first concern

39:17.939 --> 39:19.733
when I heard that he wanted
to play the part

39:19.941 --> 39:22.944
was I kind of really wanted
more of a character actor,

39:23.153 --> 39:23.987
in a way.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.574
Philip Seymour Hoffman
looked more like Skip,

39:27.783 --> 39:30.202
then Heath Ledger is, like,
a heartthrob or whatever.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.328
I'm like, "Wait a minute.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.789
I don't know
if this is gonna work."

39:33.997 --> 39:35.624
Heath, he came in
and talked to me,

39:35.832 --> 39:37.542
how he would really
get into that character

39:37.751 --> 39:39.086
and craft it,

39:39.294 --> 39:43.382
and he decided he had to get
teeth made like Skip's teeth...

39:43.590 --> 39:45.467
Back to the boneyard
for you, pal.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.303
...So that he would feel
that he was Skip

39:48.512 --> 39:50.222
and talk the way Skip talked.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.475
This interest in the exterior
and the craft

39:53.683 --> 39:56.269
and the way that the characters
would look and sound

39:56.478 --> 39:58.897
and physically look onscreen,

39:59.106 --> 40:00.816
he was sort of a painter
in that way,

40:01.024 --> 40:03.485
but he also had a psychological
interest in his characters.

40:03.693 --> 40:04.986
Oh, nice socks, man.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.488
Nice socks, nice socks.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.031
If you don't have
a sense of play

40:08.240 --> 40:09.574
and if you're too serious,

40:09.783 --> 40:12.327
the odds are you're gonna be
too much of a tightass

40:12.536 --> 40:15.872
to create characters.

40:16.081 --> 40:16.832
Skip Engblom

40:17.040 --> 40:19.459
and the Zephyr
skateboard team.

40:19.668 --> 40:20.502
Here's our entry fees.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.254
Now, where's
our trophies?

40:22.462 --> 40:23.672
I don't think
he would be afraid

40:23.880 --> 40:25.715
to try any acting technique.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.050
He had a confidence,

40:27.259 --> 40:30.262
but he wasn't afraid
to go and check the monitor

40:30.470 --> 40:32.222
and watch playback afterwards.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.771
He wanted to keep exploring
with it and pushing it.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.482
He knew that he'd get it right
when the time came.

40:42.691 --> 40:45.277
Well, Heath was just so open
and curious

40:45.485 --> 40:47.821
and absorbing
everything around him.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.159
He fully transformed himself.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.828
He has a wig, he has the teeth,

40:55.036 --> 40:58.248
and he just slides
into this crazy other skin.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.963
One thing that
I don't think people realize,

41:05.172 --> 41:07.466
as fantastic as he was
in Brokeback Mountain,

41:07.674 --> 41:10.677
he left Lords of Dogtown

41:10.886 --> 41:14.389
and was playing that role
about seven days later.

41:14.598 --> 41:16.016
Come on,
you fuckin' homo.

41:16.224 --> 41:20.479
I probably fancied
that I was staying in character

41:20.687 --> 41:24.107
by teasing him about going
to do this gay cowboy movie,

41:24.316 --> 41:27.152
and I said one...

41:27.360 --> 41:30.614
one ribbing too much
about the Brokeback,

41:30.822 --> 41:33.742
and he just gave me this look.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.953
It was like, "shut the fuck up,"

41:37.162 --> 41:41.583
and I realized, I was like...

41:41.791 --> 41:46.546
And, um, I didn't say anything
about it afterwards.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.101
Before Brokeback Mountain
came out,

42:00.310 --> 42:01.478
it would've been unthinkable

42:01.686 --> 42:07.234
to have a romantic tragedy
involving two gay cowboys,

42:07.442 --> 42:11.196
which are the very symbol
of American masculinity.

42:32.175 --> 42:36.012
This is one of the biggest
heartthrobs on Earth

42:36.221 --> 42:39.057
taking on that character.

42:39.266 --> 42:43.436
That's balls,
and that's an artist.

42:48.525 --> 42:50.402
When his name
popped up from casting,

42:50.610 --> 42:53.363
I did have a little hesitation.

42:53.572 --> 42:56.032
I didn't know at that time
if he can carry a movie,

42:56.241 --> 42:59.327
which is what he needs to do
in Brokeback Mountain.

42:59.536 --> 43:01.371
Monster's Ball
is really the reason

43:01.580 --> 43:03.915
I chose him
for Brokeback Mountain.

43:04.124 --> 43:05.000
I was that impressed.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.462
The bottom line is,

43:09.671 --> 43:11.548
we're around each other,

43:11.756 --> 43:16.469
and this thing
grabs hold of us again

43:16.678 --> 43:21.266
in the wrong place
and the wrong time,

43:21.474 --> 43:22.267
then we're dead.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.145
The self-hatred
and complexity,

43:25.353 --> 43:26.938
that just caught me right away.

43:27.147 --> 43:28.398
He clenched his fists

43:28.607 --> 43:30.692
and biting his teeth
the whole time.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.904
There was no doubt in his mind

43:35.113 --> 43:36.906
he was that person.

43:37.115 --> 43:39.951
If you can find
that character in you,

43:40.160 --> 43:43.038
then that's your success.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.456
That's golden.

43:44.664 --> 43:46.625
That's...that's the magic.

43:48.168 --> 43:50.003
Ennis, I wanted him
to be clenched,

43:50.211 --> 43:52.297
and I wanted his mouth
to be a clenched fist,

43:52.505 --> 43:53.590
and I wanted the words

43:53.798 --> 43:55.759
to be just punching
their way out from within,

43:55.967 --> 43:59.554
and just any form of expression
had to be painful.

43:59.763 --> 44:02.515
Heath played a character
that was very few words.

44:02.724 --> 44:05.101
That's the impression
people get.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.311
That's why he's a good actor.

44:06.519 --> 44:08.647
He has the most lines
in the movie,

44:08.855 --> 44:12.025
but he just say it
like a man with few words.

44:12.233 --> 44:15.570
He just has to while...
doing those lines.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.450
I don't like actor
to look at monitor,

44:20.659 --> 44:23.703
'cause I think actor
is to be seen

44:23.912 --> 44:27.207
and the monitor is
for filmmakers to look at,

44:27.415 --> 44:28.500
the viewers to look at,

44:28.708 --> 44:30.627
and when these actors
look at themselves,

44:30.835 --> 44:31.795
it messes up
their performances.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.129
It's too aware.

44:33.338 --> 44:36.466
I've never had anybody
argue with me on that one,

44:36.675 --> 44:38.927
but Heath is the only person...

44:39.135 --> 44:40.804
He would just walk up
to the camera.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.431
At first,
I was a little taken aback,

44:43.640 --> 44:45.725
'cause I have to say that
or he'll watch it anyway.

44:45.934 --> 44:47.769
It doesn't look
like he's self-aware.

44:47.977 --> 44:49.187
It just got better.

44:49.396 --> 44:53.775
Take after take,
he tried to hit a target.

44:53.983 --> 44:56.319
There is a target
he tried to hit,

44:56.528 --> 44:58.071
and when he hits it,
it's beautiful.

45:03.076 --> 45:06.538
Michelle is a brilliant actress
and person, as well,

45:06.746 --> 45:08.665
very intelligent,
natural for that role.

45:12.627 --> 45:13.420
The performance they have,

45:13.628 --> 45:16.548
that relationship in the movie,

45:16.756 --> 45:17.674
was really memorable.

45:19.676 --> 45:21.761
We're filming the toboggan,

45:21.970 --> 45:23.263
and I look at the producer,

45:23.471 --> 45:26.599
I look at the stunt coordinator,
and "Yeah, it's a toboggan."

45:26.808 --> 45:27.517
Whsssh...

45:31.730 --> 45:33.022
And they flip.

45:33.231 --> 45:36.609
It didn't look like much
from where we were seeing,

45:36.818 --> 45:38.361
but she was hurt,

45:38.570 --> 45:40.113
and when we reached
the hospital,

45:40.321 --> 45:41.823
we saw Heath
sort of holding her hand,

45:42.031 --> 45:43.616
trying to comfort her,

45:43.825 --> 45:47.078
and it was pretty obvious,
his interest in her,

45:47.287 --> 45:48.913
so that's pretty quickly
it happened.

45:51.958 --> 45:54.377
He goes,
"I want you to meet Michelle."

45:54.586 --> 45:55.587
She hugs me in this way

45:55.795 --> 45:59.007
that she kind of climbs
into my entire soul

45:59.215 --> 46:00.675
and squeezes me.

46:00.884 --> 46:01.634
I've never
been squeezed like that

46:01.843 --> 46:04.471
by someone I hadn't met before.

46:04.679 --> 46:05.972
Like, "Oh,
it's so nice to meet you..."

46:06.181 --> 46:08.057
That sweet accent that she has.

46:10.810 --> 46:12.020
He said, "I've got a surprise."

46:14.606 --> 46:16.441
"I'm gonna be a father."

46:16.649 --> 46:17.609
He was pumped.

46:17.817 --> 46:19.152
He was so excited.

46:21.321 --> 46:22.197
You know, after Brokeback,

46:22.405 --> 46:23.865
it really started to happen.

46:24.073 --> 46:27.702
It was gonna be
an important film,

46:27.911 --> 46:30.747
and there wasn't him
leaving the room.

46:30.955 --> 46:33.333
There was a level of maturity

46:33.541 --> 46:36.711
that this was something
that he could handle.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.713
Michelle!
Together!

46:38.922 --> 46:40.965
It's incredible
just to what extent

46:41.174 --> 46:43.468
this film has changed my life.

46:43.676 --> 46:47.472
It's quite miraculous.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.681
Heath felt life deeper

46:48.890 --> 46:50.892
than anyone that I've ever met.

46:51.100 --> 46:55.897
He just took everything in
that much deeper.

46:56.105 --> 46:57.482
There was one night
at Heath's place,

46:57.690 --> 46:58.691
a little wine,

46:58.900 --> 47:00.318
and then things spin,

47:00.527 --> 47:01.986
and then we were on the piano,

47:02.195 --> 47:03.947
and, you know,
just having fun,

47:04.155 --> 47:06.115
and it went into the morning.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.618
Got home, slept in late,

47:08.827 --> 47:10.745
woke up,
there was a commotion outside,

47:10.954 --> 47:12.539
knock at the door,
dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

47:12.747 --> 47:16.167
It says here, "A grand piano
from one Heath Ledger,

47:16.376 --> 47:19.254
gift to Ben Harper."

47:19.462 --> 47:20.547
I called him right away.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.590
"You're crazy. What are
you doing?" you know?

47:22.799 --> 47:25.176
"You're sending me
a grand piano.

47:25.385 --> 47:26.886
Like, this is...
You can't do this."

47:27.095 --> 47:31.432
"No, mate.
It's supposed to be with you."

47:31.641 --> 47:33.351
And what can you say?

47:33.560 --> 47:34.853
What can you say...

47:35.061 --> 47:36.563
Other than "thank you"?

47:36.771 --> 47:38.523
So then a couple weeks later,
he calls.

47:38.731 --> 47:41.317
"You know that piano?

47:41.526 --> 47:44.320
I need you to write
a lullaby for my daughter

47:44.529 --> 47:48.074
that we can play for her
when she's born."

47:48.283 --> 47:49.158
All right.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.536
I've never been trusted
so deeply.

47:51.744 --> 47:53.288
Nothing has ever
been asked of me

47:53.496 --> 47:54.831
that was that precious.

He became more of a dad
than an artist...

49:24.128 --> 49:26.756
and to say that for Heath...

49:26.965 --> 49:28.049
That's it.

49:28.257 --> 49:30.343
I mean, that's...
It's a huge thing.

49:35.431 --> 49:37.600
He really did change a lot.

49:37.809 --> 49:39.560
It was a really exciting time.

49:39.769 --> 49:41.771
He was out
to do everything possible

49:41.980 --> 49:44.732
to be a good dad,
and, you know, a good partner,

49:44.941 --> 49:47.193
and everything
that we all wish we could be.

49:47.402 --> 49:50.780
He'd reached that spot
where "I've got a child.

49:50.989 --> 49:52.198
My life's changed, and hold on,

49:52.407 --> 49:53.616
I've gotta be in charge
of my own destiny."

49:53.825 --> 49:56.035
Heath was a fantastic father.

49:56.244 --> 50:00.665
He had so much love for her,
and it was so beautiful to see.

50:00.873 --> 50:02.834
Being a dad was, like,

50:03.042 --> 50:05.420
his favorite thing
that he ever did.

50:08.131 --> 50:10.049

he'd be moving to New York.

50:10.258 --> 50:12.301
I thought he was gonna move
into the city.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.220
Michelle had plans for Brooklyn.

50:15.805 --> 50:17.557
Being the person that he is,

50:17.765 --> 50:19.642
he fell in love
with Brooklyn too.

50:22.478 --> 50:23.813
He said, "I love Michelle.

50:24.022 --> 50:25.356
I love the world we're building.

50:25.565 --> 50:28.651
I love the neighborhood."

50:28.860 --> 50:30.111
They found a beautiful house.

50:30.319 --> 50:32.447
It felt like he was, like,
the trailblazer of Brooklyn.

50:34.032 --> 50:35.283
Cruising through
the streets of New York

50:35.491 --> 50:36.576
with Matilda on his shoulders.

50:36.784 --> 50:38.369
I mean, that's when he was...

50:38.578 --> 50:39.704
He was just totally happy.

50:39.912 --> 50:42.373
Waking up
every morning to that...

50:42.582 --> 50:44.042
that smile, it just...

50:44.250 --> 50:46.044
It just...
it brightens your day,

50:46.252 --> 50:47.211
it really does,

50:47.420 --> 50:51.340
and I'm incredibly proud
of both of them.

51:07.690 --> 51:09.650
I had given him an early copy
of a record of mine

51:09.859 --> 51:11.360
called Both Sides of the Gun.

51:11.569 --> 51:12.653
He was getting into videos,

51:12.862 --> 51:13.863
and he was getting
into directing

51:14.072 --> 51:14.906
and getting behind the camera,

51:15.114 --> 51:15.990
and that was...

51:16.199 --> 51:17.283
That was exciting him a lot.

51:17.492 --> 51:20.745
Then I got a call
at some crazy hour.

51:20.953 --> 51:21.996
"I really wanna do a video.

51:22.205 --> 51:24.123
This record means a lot to me.

51:24.332 --> 51:26.000
How about the song
'Morning Yearning,'"

51:26.209 --> 51:29.337
and I said, "Heath,
that would be amazing,

51:29.545 --> 51:30.797
and I'm gonna leave you alone.

51:31.005 --> 51:33.341

52:03.788 --> 52:07.500
Heath was a one-man
force of nature.

52:07.708 --> 52:10.461
He would do lights, the colors,

52:13.548 --> 52:15.383

Little Radio, downtown.

53:09.478 --> 53:13.399
Had a soundstage,
not too big, not too small.

53:13.608 --> 53:15.526
They had a pirate radio station.

53:15.735 --> 53:18.571
They'd do underground shows
for underground bands,

53:18.779 --> 53:20.948

53:21.157 --> 53:23.659
The place had a photo booth,

this guy is going to have
a lifetime behind the camera

53:45.640 --> 53:46.557
as well as in front of it.

53:54.607 --> 53:56.692

53:56.901 --> 54:02.031
to establish his moviemaking
company with me.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.574
All the people

Matt was one that he trusted

54:09.038 --> 54:11.082
The fact that we decided
to do this together...

54:11.290 --> 54:14.001
I think a big surprise
to a lot of people, actually,

54:14.210 --> 54:16.545
to the people that
Heath was doing business with,

54:16.754 --> 54:18.756
people that were offering
him deals at studios.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.301
When it was time to get
an office for The Masses,

54:22.510 --> 54:23.970
we made sure
that it'd be a place

54:24.178 --> 54:25.638
where Heath could
maintain his privacy.

54:25.846 --> 54:26.889
We didn't want anybody to know

54:27.098 --> 54:29.350

new office.

54:29.558 --> 54:32.436

on his motorcycle,

54:32.645 --> 54:34.647
of course,
cloaked in his helmet,

54:34.855 --> 54:36.107
and it was like being home.

54:36.315 --> 54:38.484
"The Masses" is a cool name

54:38.693 --> 54:40.778
because it's not meant
to be exclusive.

54:40.987 --> 54:43.489
Everyone has the capacity
to tell their story.

54:45.950 --> 54:47.827
And they had
the whole floor of a building.

54:48.035 --> 54:50.079

as you walked up those stairs,

54:50.288 --> 54:52.748
you were going into, like,
the hubbub of creativity.

54:59.088 --> 55:02.091
Heath had a little slogan,
and that was "Keep It Real."

55:02.300 --> 55:06.554
To do something surprising,
mess up the frame a little bit,

55:06.762 --> 55:08.306
to not be so symmetrical...

55:08.514 --> 55:10.808
To try something.

55:11.017 --> 55:12.518
Our profound love of music

55:12.727 --> 55:16.897

kind of developing her songs

57:46.839 --> 57:49.216

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:40.387
Like, literally,
not a text, not a phone call...

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:41.347
Just "I'm at the gate."

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.891
He'd crash our breakfast.

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:53.484
He never slept.
He never re...

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.694
His email...

01:00:57.655 --> 01:01:01.075
His email was
l'llberunningaround

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:04.078
at something something
dot com...

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.205
and he always was.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:19.968
You always wonder

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.847
if people sense
their own mortality.

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:26.684
Certain people
have that power...

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.729
and if anybody did, it was him.

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:47.287
Talked about Nick Drake,

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:50.416
a musician that he was
absolutely passionate about

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:51.625
and wanted
to tell his story,

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.961
how he died

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.130
and his process
of creating music.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.679
It was all about Nick Drake.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.140
Heath was...
I mean, he was gone.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:10.310
He was all things Nick
at that time.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:12.146
I mean, he had every record.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.480
He had interviews.

01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:15.399
He was completely immersed
in Nick Drake.

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:21.447
Always playing his music

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:24.116
and talking about the visuals
that he would put to this music.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.620
It escalated more and more

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:29.830
and became
a huge passion for him.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:38.589
He'd always had this thing
for these artists,

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:42.217
people who died at, like, 27,

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.511
like Kurt Cobain
and Janis Joplin

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.554
and this whole list of people.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:50.184
At a young age, he was like,
"I'm just like these people."

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.060
It was weird.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.023
I remember him saying,
"I've got a lot to do.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:58.317
I don't feel
like I have much time.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.319
I just don't think I'm going
to be around that long, so...

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:01.528
Don't know why.

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.655
I've just got
to get things done now."

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.418
I guess our story together

01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:18.712
kind of chronicles
his love life,

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:20.881
his struggles
with love and a relationship

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:22.299
and they're trying to manage

01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:25.302
both his professional life
and his private life.

01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:27.930
It's a bit of a double-edged
sword, I believe,

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.890
'cause a part of you
wants to stay at home

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.600
and do nothing
for the rest of your life,

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:32.810
but as soon as you're there,

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:34.770
you want to get out
and start working.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:35.771
There's a fascination

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.857
and an addiction
to the lifestyle.

01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:42.528
Heath brought something
to the part,

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.948
and it wasn't
the movie star part

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.616
that he brought.

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:50.786
There was a credibility
and vulnerability

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:52.788
to his performance.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:59.002
He was always able
to show his struggle or conflict

01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:00.963
in whatever character he played,

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.715
that he personalized
the performance.

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.053
Not with the girls.

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:10.138
Yes, Robbie.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.598
- No.
- Robbie!

01:04:11.807 --> 01:04:13.934
You're not
taking my kids!

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:16.395
Relationships happen.
Relationships go wrong.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:17.813
If you haven't
been through it yet,

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.231
you don't know
how to adjust and cope,

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:21.608
and then you're in
the father position,

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:22.943
partner position,

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.987
and you're doing things
that aren't quite right.

01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:34.997
I'm Not There
is really art imitating life

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.125
in such a beautiful,
painful way.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:43.714
I feel he was struggling

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:46.633
with being able to give
Michelle and Matilda

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.260
all the attention he wanted to.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.762
Their breakup
was tough enough.

01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:54.600
I really felt the...
for Michelle,

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:57.436
a lot of stuff
was projected on her.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.691
It was pretty
heartbreaking and upsetting.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:06.695
Things were unraveling
for Heath.

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:10.699
That whole idea
of controlling your destiny,

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.493
designing your destiny...

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:17.706
the unraveling
was not part of the design,

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.333
and he couldn't control it.

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:26.256
So his lack of sleep
and needing to sleep

01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:27.925
had a big effect on him.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.971
He had to take
medicated sleeping,

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.389
which wasn't good for his body.

01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:41.772
I ran into him in New York.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.775
I hadn't seen him
for a couple of years,

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:48.403
and wow, Heath has... changed,

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:49.947
but the way he has changed

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:52.866
kind of, like, got me
a little concerned, you know...

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.745
and I looked at him
and I thought, wow...

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:02.584
with a bit of a concern,
you know?

01:06:16.932 --> 01:06:19.101
We had
a few tough times together,

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.353
like, sadnesses in life.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:28.986
Music is absolutely healing.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.908
Music was a way
for him to heal himself.

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:38.870
Nick, can you play
River of Life?

01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:42.416
There you go. Yay!

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.751
River of Life.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.214
If you asked Heath who he was,

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:51.800
he would tell you
he was an actor,

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.593
he was a filmmaker,

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:55.012
and he was a brother.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.472
He was a brother to me,
and to many.

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.853
I guess
being friends with Heath,

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.605
someone so big and glamorous

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:08.066
and... action hero

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.318
and all that stuff...

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:14.948
The fact that he carried
that gentility in his heart

01:07:15.157 --> 01:07:19.661
and made that
an active principle for himself

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.039
gave me certain strength too...

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.547
And he would
always encourage me.

01:07:30.756 --> 01:07:31.840
Like, I'd see a wave coming,

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.050
and he'd say,
"Don't be afraid to fall..."

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:40.807
and that was a real important
aspect of who Heath was.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.395
He didn't have
that kind of fear.

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:51.359
He was going
to direct his first film,

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.529
which was The Queen's Gambit,
about a chess player.

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:02.662
His love of chess
was, you know, legendary.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:07.167
I always felt that he was
five moves in front of me.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:10.378
By the time
he was 10 or 11 or so,

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:13.715
it was pretty hard
to actually beat him.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.303
He was
an amazing chess player,

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.221
and it's something
that we did every day.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.099
Whether we were
together or apart,

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:25.769
we were playing chess online
or chess face to face.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:32.442
Heath was trying
to achieve a grandmaster status

01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:37.072
and was only a few points away
from achieving his goal.

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:41.368
When he read that story,
Queen's Gambit,

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:44.537
he thought, wow, this could be
the right size film

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:47.624
to take a bite and direct it.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.417
So this is about
a young chess player

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:54.714
who is addicted
to drugs, to pills.

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:57.716
He understood that story

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:00.386
from inside out.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.139
He wanted to use chess

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:05.809
as a metaphor
for the girl's life,

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:09.020
and he had something to say.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:11.022
There are many actors
that want to direct

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:14.693
that almost
are the actor directing,

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:22.826
but he had the ability
to communicate his ideas

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:28.456
that he could translate that
into a filmic story.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.041
The only time that I'm alive

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:34.045
and living and expressing
and feeling and relating

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:35.714
is when I'm on-set

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.675
in that time
between "Action" and "Cut."

01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:40.051
I called Heath,

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.095
and I said, you know,
"This is what's happening.

01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:44.471
They're putting together
the next Batman film,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.392
and the Joker's
going to be the villain,

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.352
and, you know,
is that of interest?"

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.812
And I remember him,
you know,

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.648
it was like...
there was no pause.

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:55.609
It was like, "Absolutely.

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:56.860
I want that.
How do I...

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:58.069
you know, what do we do?

01:09:58.278 --> 01:09:59.654
I'll get on a plane.
I'll fly out.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.072
I want to meet with Chris,"
you know.

01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:02.324
"Can you get me in a room
with Chris Nolan?"

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:05.368
I'd already seen
this world he'd created

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:06.912
in Batman Begins,

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.039
and so I knew
there was an opportunity

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:11.416
for a new version of the Joker,

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:12.792
and that excited me,

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:14.044
and I also knew instantly
what to do.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:17.047
So we had about a month,
roughly two months.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:20.091
He had already started
to occupy the character.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.011
I locked myself away
for six weeks in a room,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.304
and I kind of came up
with this creep.

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:27.015
Walk around like a madman

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.433
and finding posture,
finding stance.

01:10:28.642 --> 01:10:30.769
Finding his voice
is very important,

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:32.020
because when you find the voice

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:35.148
you find the breath
within the voice.

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:37.234
It's like, man,
the Joker, though.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:40.153
Jack Nicholson
did the Joker, man.

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:44.282
I said,
"How do you tackle that, like,

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:47.827
without just
doing a version of Jack?

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:51.831
I mean, how do you even
talk or laugh or..."

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.583
I was sitting there, walking,
just thinking,

01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:54.876
and I suddenly hear,

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:56.211
"Do you want to know

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.088
how I got these scars?"

01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.589
I'm like... I look at him,

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:01.007
and he's kind of walking,
holding his shirt,

01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:04.427
and he's like, "My daddy
was a drinker and a fiend,"

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.346
and he gives me this look,
and...

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.431
man, goosebumps,
chills run down me,

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.600
and he does
that little monologue for me.

01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:13.687
"Why so serious?"
he finishes.

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.313
I was just, "Holy..."

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:16.147
and I jump into the street.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.066
Whoo! Yelled it out.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:19.150
I'm punching him in the chest,

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:20.360
and he's like,
"Don't tell anyone."

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:24.906
He turns to me,

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:30.161
and he says,
why so serious?

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:31.705
He comes at me
with the knife.

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:34.207
"Why so serious?"

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:39.754
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:44.676
"Let's put a smile
on that face,"

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.136
and...

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:50.932
Why so serious?

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:55.312
When we were shooting
the scene

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.105
where he comes into the party,

01:11:57.314 --> 01:11:59.441
there was a crowd
that side of the camera

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.859
and this side of the camera.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.486
It was a very large crowd, so...

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:05.739
he didn't expect it
to be so big.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:09.200
He said, "This feels
like walking onto a stage.

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.036
I wasn't prepared
for so many people.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.620
How do I play this?"

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:13.830
And I said, "Well...

01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:16.291
well, you're a psychopath,

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.085
so they're your toys.

01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:21.212
You play with your toys."

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:26.509
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:32.557
We are tonight's entertainment.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.936
I only have one question.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:39.939
Where is Harvey Dent?

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.826
You know where Harvey is?
Do you know who he is?

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.036
That's another trademark

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:54.704
of the actor
that Heath had become.

01:12:54.913 --> 01:12:57.082
He was able to chuck his vanity,

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.501
and I think
his conception of the Joker

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.420
did show him
kind of warts and all,

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:05.006
and he did it on his own
in the makeup trailer,

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:06.508
and it was very simple.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.094
All it was, was just, like, a
wash of white pancake makeup

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.805
and some smear of red lips.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:13.223
The prosthetics
came up onto the lip

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:14.474
and feathered onto the lip,

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.185
so it was almost halfway
into the mouth,

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:18.561
and, of course, when you speak,

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.271
the feathering
of the prosthetics

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.689
became loosened,

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.817
and the last thing Heath
wanted to do was to go back

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:26.361
and spend another 20 minutes
or half an hour

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:30.281
trying to get
the lips glued back again,

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.659
so he licked...
he licked his lips...

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.870
a lot...

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.540
and then, slowly, that became
a part of the character.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:45.713
He knew that he had
something that was amazing.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.090
He had put
all this work into it,

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:48.383
and he was actually
enjoying the work.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:49.551
Everyone,

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.428
every sound technician,
every producer,

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.346
was floored by what he was
doing in The Dark Knight.

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:56.641
People would be scurrying
up to screens,

01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:58.059
trying to get glimpses on-set,

01:13:58.268 --> 01:14:00.437
just because they knew
when he was on,

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:01.813
it was on.

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:05.692
He felt for the first time,
as an actor,

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.070
that he was like,
"I'm untouchable.

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.947
Every scene I do
with any other actor,

01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:13.575
it doesn't matter
how amazing they are.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.036
I'm controlling
and leading these scenes."

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:18.788
He was so confident,

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:20.206
and he was so proud
of that role.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:22.625
He was really excited
for that film to come out.

01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:26.963
He was... it was the first time
I'd heard him in a long time

01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:31.468
being excited about, like,
"this role I've nailed."

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:34.053
You've changed things...
forever.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:35.722
Then why do you want
to kill me?

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:40.143
I don't want to kill you!

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:42.270
What would I do
without you?

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:43.354
Go back to ripping
off mob dealers?

01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:45.440
No, no.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:46.524
No.

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:50.278
No, you...
you complete me.

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:52.614
You're garbage
who kills for money.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:53.448
Don't talk like one of them.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.158
You're not...

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:57.452
even if you'd like to be.

01:14:59.037 --> 01:15:00.497
To them, you're just a freak...

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.540
like me.

01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:03.875
When he wasn't working,

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.878
he would come to set
and observe and watch Chris

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:08.505
'cause he was so enamored

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.089
with, you know,
Chris as a director

01:15:10.298 --> 01:15:12.133
and wanted to learn
as much as he could

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:13.968
about what he was building
and what he was doing.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:16.930
A lot of people like to think

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:20.266
that it was a strenuous process
for him,

01:15:20.475 --> 01:15:21.893
but he would come off the set,

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:25.396
and we'd chat,
and we'd have a laugh and joke,

01:15:25.605 --> 01:15:29.901
and we had more fun
than was, um...

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:32.612
than was respectable

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.322
for hardworking artists.

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:39.577
It was the most fun
I've had with a character,

01:15:39.786 --> 01:15:40.578
hands down.

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:42.872
Creatively, it was just...

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:44.666
it was too good to be true.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.467
It was Christmas,
and my whole family,

01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:55.969
we were having this wonderful
great big dinner.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:59.639
He came and surprised us,
as he loved to do.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:05.687
He'd shown me some snippets
of him as the Joker,

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:08.147
and, I mean, I was blown away.

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:09.607
I couldn't believe it,

01:16:09.816 --> 01:16:11.818
and I just said to him,
you know,

01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:13.444
"This is amazing.

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:15.613
This is, like, taking it
to the next level.

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:16.990
Like, you're going
to be nominated for this,

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:18.533
I'm telling you right now,"

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:19.909
and he just smiled.

01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:23.162
Heath was over the moon

01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:25.540
about the role of the Joker
in The Dark Knight.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.084
He was very pleased
with the way it was going

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:31.421
and the input that he had
into that character.

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:36.259
It was after the dinner,

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.845
and he kind of, like,
leaned over at one point

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.014
and said, "Oh, by the way,

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:42.974
I'm taking you back to London
with me,"

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:45.268
and I was like, "What?"
and my mom was like, "What?"

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:49.689
"Oh, no, here we go again."

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:52.525
It was his time
to take his little sister,

01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:55.486
introduce her
to the entertainment world.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.532
Heath was
in the best place of his life.

01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.702
He had a kid
who he loved and adored.

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.496
He was making the films
he wanted to make.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:08.583
He had big plans for his future.

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:12.879
In three weeks' time,

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:14.547
I start filming
with Terry Gilliam,

01:17:14.756 --> 01:17:15.757
and I'd really do any...

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:18.593
I'd cut carrots
and serve the catering

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.346
on a Gilliam film.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:24.349
I really, really love the guy,
and so...

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.101
yeah, I'm doing The Imaginarium
of Dr. Parnassus,

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:29.646
and then I'll
drop to the ground, dead,

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:30.980
for a year,

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:32.649
and hibernate.

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:34.692
The Imaginarium
of Dr. Parnassus...

01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:37.445
I was able to work with him
for two weeks on,

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:40.490
in freezing cold London,
in all the night shoots,

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:41.783
in all of its glory.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.869
We were on
Blackfriars Bridge...

01:17:45.078 --> 01:17:46.913
bitterly cold.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:49.999
He spent most of the night
hanging off the bridge,

01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.334
having rain poured on him...

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.837
so he was very wet.

01:17:55.046 --> 01:17:56.422
I'm not sure that helped him.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:01.511
A lot of the crew
were fighting colds and whatnot,

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.597
but I do just remember
Gerry saying

01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:06.349
he had the strength of a horse,

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.893
I think is what he said.

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:12.855
His body was tired, I know.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:14.148
He was tired.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:17.151
He developed a bad flu,
and that exhausted him.

01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:23.991
We were staying
in the same apartment.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.828
I would wake,
I'd hear him wandering around,

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.871
and sometimes
he'd come into my room,

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.833
and we had the conversation

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:35.169
that the sleeping medication
wasn't really helping him sleep.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.134
At times, he would say,

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:43.970
"I'm just having a hard time
kind of, you know,

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.555
laying it down
at the end of the day

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:47.432
and not thinking about stuff."

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.143
I knew the pressures
that were in his life.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.311
I knew he was sick.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.188
I knew he had pneumonia.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:57.191
I knew he had these long flights
from London to New York.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.610
We were about
to wrap up in London.

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:05.199
He had sent myself
and his assistant, Nathan, ahead

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:06.492
to prep the apartment

01:19:06.701 --> 01:19:09.495
for when we were going
to all be there, and...

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:24.677
I hadn't talked
to him all morning,

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.137
and it was pretty rare,

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:28.014
and I was getting concerned.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:31.100
I kept texting,
saying, "Hey, what's up?

01:19:31.309 --> 01:19:32.351
Where are you?
What's going on?"

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:37.607
And, honestly, he would've
texted back or called me back

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:40.193
in almost any situation...

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:43.529
any situation,
except if he was...

01:19:43.738 --> 01:19:45.156
you know...

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.867
♪ Someday my pain ♪

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:51.329
And I put my BlackBerry down
on the desk,

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.331
and, um...

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:55.082
I kind of just stared at it...

01:19:58.628 --> 01:19:59.462
♪ Harness your blame ♪

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.339
And then the phone rang,

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:05.760
and it was his publicist,
Mara Buxbaum,

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.304
and, um, and she was crying.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.226
And I called his dad,

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:14.519
and his dad's phone was off,

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:15.728
and I called his mum,

01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:18.105
and she was trying
to find out information,

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.608
so I called one of our friends
in New York

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.860
to see if she could
go to his house,

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.487
and she was like,
"Trev, I'm here,

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:26.197
and I can't get in,"

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:29.742
and that's when
reality kicked in.

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:32.620
More texts

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.080
start rolling in.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:37.250
I'm like, "No, no, no, no,
someone's messing with me,"

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.752
and I actually called the phone,
and it rung out.

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:42.421
I wanted to say,
"Please call me back.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.674
Please call me back,"
you know,

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:46.008
but I just froze and hung up.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:50.930
I got a call from a friend,

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:57.395
and right away, I knew
something awful had happened.

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:02.984
I did call his phone
a few times.

01:21:07.655 --> 01:21:10.700
The world did find out
before we did.

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:12.702
It will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:13.911
I guess we're no different

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.455
from anyone else
that loses a child

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:18.499
or loses somebody suddenly...

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:19.667
the only difference being

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:21.878
is that we had
to live our feelings out

01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:22.962
in the public eye.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:26.090
It was our boy,

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:29.468
and it was the world's moment,

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.596
and our private moment,

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:34.223
but it was something
that we had to share,

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:37.268
and sharing that...
across the world

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.394
was so hard, you know?

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:44.775
That was a very sad day.
It was.

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:47.361
♪ What might have been lost ♪

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.697
I just got up
and went home.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.241
I just hid.

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:55.202

I was shooting a music video
on a day that he died.

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:11.093
I was in Eau Claire, Wisconsin,
with Justin, who is Bon Iver.

01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:14.847
I saw that I had, like,
35 messages on my phone.

01:22:15.056 --> 01:22:17.183
♪ Don't bother me

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.852
I just heard
what sounded like crying...

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:22.897
and Matt told me

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.982
that his friend Heath
had passed away,

01:22:25.191 --> 01:22:27.944
and I just held him
for the longest time,

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.362
and I just told him,
"Whatever you need to do, man,

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.739
we're here for you."

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:33.282
This person that I just met

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:36.243
just had lost
somebody so important to them.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:39.580
It was no longer about making
a Bon Iver music video anymore.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:44.794
This was now our chance
to be there with Matt

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:47.171
as he grieved.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:52.134

♪ Don't bother me ♪

01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:56.180
I was deeply sad,

01:22:56.389 --> 01:22:57.890
but Heath didn't want me
to be sad.

01:22:58.099 --> 01:23:01.602
He wanted to see me smile
all the time,

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:07.566
and he couldn't have possibly
given me more in my life,

01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:09.902
and I'm very lucky.

01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:41.142
Out of these three days

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.560
that I spent with Matt,

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:45.938
I got the next five years
of my life.

01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:47.982
I started writing
all these words down,

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.233
some of these visions

01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:51.152
that Matt
would kind of tell me

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.821
about Heath growing up
in Australia,

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:56.824
and the words ended up
being the first song there,

01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:57.783
and I called it "Perth."

01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:08.377
It's still hard
when people talk about it,

01:24:08.586 --> 01:24:11.172
and people have
preconceived ideas about how...

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.965
surrounding that period of time.

01:24:13.174 --> 01:24:14.050
It's, you know...

01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:16.719
but that's what people do,
you know?

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:19.138
They come up
with their version of it

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:22.475
that makes it
convenient and tidy

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:26.312
and, you know,
and also tells a good story.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.399
The truth is, he was super happy

01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:33.194
and was loving life,

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:36.822
and he struggled
with some demons,

01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:41.202
but he wasn't wanting
to go anywhere but forward.

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:46.832
His heart was just
incredibly beautiful.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:51.337
Fearless in how he loved
and how he opened his heart.

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:53.047
He was seeing the world

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:55.883
in a way
that the rest of us didn't,

01:24:56.092 --> 01:24:58.511
and in a way
that the rest of us couldn't,

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:02.556
and time and convention meant
absolutely nothing to him.

01:25:04.225 --> 01:25:05.434
He had this light around him.

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:06.435

01:25:06.644 --> 01:25:07.770
he shone light on people.

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:08.854

for him being around...

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:15.361

that he completed
so much in his life

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.468
that not only he is proud of,

01:25:39.677 --> 01:25:42.096
but it's left
for his little girl, Matilda,

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.098
to see what her daddy was

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:47.268
and how creative and artistic
he was.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.228
There's
all of this footage of him.

that she gets to watch

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:56.068

of who her father was.

01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:58.863

that he could've done

innumerable more
extraordinary performances

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.244

"Somebody's maybe making

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:38.689
an impressionistic film
about my life someday?"

01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:41.317

any thought, no.

a pretty boring movie.
