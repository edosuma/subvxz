32:34.875 --> 32:38.250
Senior Advisor
to the President,

32:38.250 --> 32:40.375
and an office
in the West Wing.

32:42.458 --> 32:44.917
It would be the greatest honor
of my career.

32:44.917 --> 32:48.000
I know
you had your concerns

32:48.000 --> 32:50.792
about even
coming on temporarily.

32:50.792 --> 32:53.166
I did, yeah.

32:53.166 --> 32:55.083
Can we agree
to put those aside?

32:55.083 --> 32:57.625
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm on a train tonight

32:57.625 --> 33:00.125
to meet with Franny's
case worker in the morning --

33:00.125 --> 33:01.792
a home visit,
they call it.

33:01.792 --> 33:02.959
Well,
that sounds encouraging.

33:02.959 --> 33:06.458
I'd have to
consult with her first

33:06.458 --> 33:09.041
before moving to Washington
full time.

33:09.041 --> 33:10.458
[Keane] Of course.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.125
Before you go,

33:12.125 --> 33:14.333
take a look at something
for me, will you?

33:14.333 --> 33:16.625
Sure.
[Keane] It's a Pentagon plan

33:16.625 --> 33:19.458
to permanently base
a 5,000-strong combat brigade

33:19.458 --> 33:22.708
and two Raptor squadrons
in the Baltic States.

33:22.708 --> 33:24.750
Unfortunately,
it can't leave this room.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.291
You're gonna
have to read it here.

33:28.208 --> 33:30.125

34:07.542 --> 34:09.166

I'm allowed a razor.

34:29.667 --> 34:33.417
Every day the same
bloody questions over and over

34:33.417 --> 34:34.250

hundreds of us.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.083
Really, what can you do
with asses like that?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.208
I wish you had given me a chance
to talk you out of it.

34:50.834 --> 34:52.583
Why didn't you?

34:54.333 --> 34:57.333
I knew your arguments already,
Saul.

34:57.333 --> 34:58.291
I didn't need
to hear them again.

35:05.917 --> 35:07.959
Believe me.

35:07.959 --> 35:11.250
It was never my intention
for things to turn so dark.

35:17.667 --> 35:21.041
Ultimately, I lost control
of what I set in motion.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.583
You remember
what Graham Greene said,

35:24.583 --> 35:25.750
don't you?

35:25.750 --> 35:28.583
About what?

35:28.583 --> 35:29.708
The secret services.

35:29.708 --> 35:33.375
That they're
the only real measure

35:33.375 --> 35:36.291
of a nation's
political health...

35:36.291 --> 35:39.875

of its subconscious.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.375
God help us all.

35:47.208 --> 35:50.125
What I did was unforgivable,
Saul,

35:50.125 --> 35:53.000
but I'm not sure
it was wrong.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.917
There's something off
about her --

35:55.917 --> 35:57.083
the President, I mean.

35:57.083 --> 36:01.458
I know.
I've said it before.

36:01.458 --> 36:04.250
There's something
dogmatic and dangerous,

un-American.

I can do for you?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.375
Actually, yes.

36:32.667 --> 36:35.959
There's a young teaching fellow
at G.W. --

36:35.959 --> 36:37.375

Of course.

and number.

as far as I can tell.
Well, in point of fact,

49:51.959 --> 49:53.000
we have two memoranda

49:53.000 --> 49:54.834
from the Justice Department
right here.

49:54.834 --> 49:56.333
And how was Saul Berenson
connected?

49:56.333 --> 49:57.208
He almost died
in the bombing.

49:57.208 --> 49:59.750
There's evidence
of his complicity.

49:59.750 --> 50:01.417
Where? What evidence?
The NSA's made

50:01.417 --> 50:03.917
[Wellington] its meta-databases
available to us.

50:03.917 --> 50:05.250
The NSA?

50:05.250 --> 50:07.792
He had multiple contacts with
each of the core conspirators

50:07.792 --> 50:09.208
in the weeks leading up to
and after --

50:09.208 --> 50:11.333
Yeah. Of course he did --
in the context of his job.

50:11.333 --> 50:12.208
Well, we'll see.
We're in the process

50:12.208 --> 50:14.458
of evaluating
those conversations now.

50:15.166 --> 50:17.625
David,
you sent me out there

50:17.625 --> 50:19.667
to personally assure people
this would never happen.

50:19.667 --> 50:21.834
You -- You used me.

50:21.834 --> 50:23.625
Yes, we did,
and for good reason.

50:23.625 --> 50:25.333
Yeah, to provide cover for
a political housecleaning.

50:25.333 --> 50:28.792
This -- This has nothing
to do with the conspiracy.

50:28.792 --> 50:29.708
This is payback,
pure and simple.

50:29.708 --> 50:31.708
You're wrong.
[Carrie] I don't think so.

50:31.708 --> 50:33.959
And I don't think
the President will, either.

50:37.583 --> 50:40.041

50:43.834 --> 50:45.917
[man] Slow down, ma'am.

50:45.917 --> 50:47.417
Where are you going?
To see the President.

50:48.834 --> 50:50.250
Ronald, I need to see
the President.

50:50.250 --> 50:52.208
She's not available.
[Carrie] It's urgent.

50:52.208 --> 50:54.542
Ma'am, we've been ordered to
escort you out of the building.

50:54.542 --> 50:56.708
Ordered? By who?
Mr. Wellington.

50:57.875 --> 50:59.208
Does the President know?

51:01.041 --> 51:02.542
Madam President?

51:02.542 --> 51:04.542
Madam President,
I need to talk to you.

51:04.542 --> 51:05.166
It's important.
