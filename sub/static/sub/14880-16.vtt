00:00.072 --> 00:01.552
Previously
on <i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:02.138 --> 00:04.311
What's going on Jai?
Come with me...

00:04.313 --> 00:05.995
I need you to come home.

00:05.999 --> 00:08.808
There are things that I need
to say to you face-to-face.

00:08.810 --> 00:10.141
Mossad is using us
to spy on Khalid.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.632
I'm sorry,
Khalid is dating an American.

00:12.634 --> 00:15.562
If I can turn her,
she can help us track him.

00:15.564 --> 00:17.299
You didn't tell me that you
needed to know where Khalid was

00:17.301 --> 00:19.472
so that you could drop
a missile on him.

00:19.474 --> 00:21.173
We droned the wrong site,
Henry.

00:21.175 --> 00:22.639
The drone strike was not
a failure.

00:22.641 --> 00:24.471
Why do you think
my sentence was commuted?

00:24.473 --> 00:25.971
They must be transferring
the funds to Khalid

00:25.973 --> 00:26.973
through a courier.

00:26.975 --> 00:28.473
Inside is a GPS tracker.

00:28.475 --> 00:31.672
Goodbye, Megan.

00:31.674 --> 00:33.672
Then we follow the courier
all the way to Khalid.

00:33.674 --> 00:35.006
Megan was the courier.

00:35.008 --> 00:36.007
They know we're here.

00:36.009 --> 00:37.977
Still one way out of this.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.658 --> 00:58.858
Hello.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.193
I am sure you don't want
to waste time

01:00.195 --> 01:02.461
with pleasantries,
Annie Walker.

01:02.463 --> 01:06.332
What do you want, Khalid?

01:17.507 --> 01:19.207
Eyal Lavin is alive.

01:19.209 --> 01:20.709
I won't kill him.

01:20.711 --> 01:22.676
And I will return him to you.

01:22.678 --> 01:23.847
But only if--

01:23.848 --> 01:25.712
If you get the money you were
supposed to get from Megan?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.895
Let's leave Megan
out of this.

01:28.896 --> 01:31.263
Now someone has betrayed me.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.098
What I want is the names

01:33.100 --> 01:34.432
of all the employees
in my father's company

01:34.434 --> 01:36.066
who are CIA assets.

01:36.068 --> 01:38.202
Those who are responsible
for my situation

01:38.204 --> 01:40.237
need to be punished.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.572
You will get the names for me.

01:41.574 --> 01:43.740
I don't know if we have anyone
in your company.

01:43.742 --> 01:45.375
And I don't have access
to that information.

01:45.377 --> 01:47.011
You have 24 hours.

01:47.013 --> 01:49.780
I will contact you
on this same phone

01:49.782 --> 01:52.082
for details as to where
to do the exchange.

01:52.084 --> 01:55.352
I do not want Megan
to have had to die in vain.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.366
So what do you think?

02:09.369 --> 02:12.536
Show me the money we discussed
and I'll tell you what I think.

02:18.944 --> 02:20.578
It's tricky.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.446
But everything worth doing
in life is tricky,

02:22.448 --> 02:24.414
illegal or both.

02:24.416 --> 02:27.283
Eric Barber said you were
a fearless and brilliant asset.

02:27.285 --> 02:29.118
Well...

02:29.120 --> 02:32.121
He was right about that.

02:32.123 --> 02:33.155
I have a friend.

02:33.157 --> 02:34.790
Worked the electrical grid
contract

02:34.792 --> 02:36.158
for the American consulate.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.628
The mainframe connects
to all U.S. government servers,

02:38.630 --> 02:39.829
including CIA,

02:39.831 --> 02:41.330
through a high-speed
transatlantic cable.

02:41.332 --> 02:42.999
The consulate?

02:43.001 --> 02:44.800
There's no way
to hack in remotely?

02:44.802 --> 02:46.135
It's
a closed-circuit intranet.

02:46.137 --> 02:48.103
There are no portals in Holland,

02:48.105 --> 02:49.671
other than the hard line
inside that building.

02:49.673 --> 02:51.306
Talk to me
about the consulate.

02:51.308 --> 02:52.941
They upgraded security

02:52.943 --> 02:54.809
right after
the <i>Jyllands-Posten</i> protests.

02:54.811 --> 02:57.813
PGP,
application-layer firewall.

02:57.815 --> 02:59.748
Your best shot
is the computer terminal

02:59.750 --> 03:01.115
inside the infirmary.

03:01.117 --> 03:04.018
It's open to the web
for access to medical research.

03:04.020 --> 03:06.153
The infirmary?

03:06.155 --> 03:08.288
<i>Ja.</i> Is tough.

03:08.290 --> 03:09.356
I have an idea.

03:09.358 --> 03:11.959
Hey, Auggie.

03:11.961 --> 03:14.161
I knew this was a long shot,
because you're in Iraq

03:14.163 --> 03:15.295
and I figured
I'd get your voice mail.

03:15.297 --> 03:17.164
But this is usually the time

03:17.166 --> 03:19.500
when I call
and ask for your advice.

03:19.502 --> 03:23.170
I'm facing a situation,

03:23.172 --> 03:24.471
and there are
1,000 reasons

03:24.473 --> 03:25.505
for me not
to go through with it.

03:26.642 --> 03:29.876
But my gut is saying
I should do it.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.979
Thanks for letting me
talk this out.

03:31.981 --> 03:34.047
Bye.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.868
No.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.242
No, no.

04:37.576 --> 04:39.075
Hello?

04:39.077 --> 04:40.744
My name is Danielle Brooks.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.111
I'm an American citizen.

04:42.113 --> 04:44.180
I've been attacked.
Can you help me?

05:22.326 --> 05:23.994
Blood type.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.600
Mrs. Brooks.

05:30.602 --> 05:32.335
I'm Bob Breiding,
vice consul.

05:32.337 --> 05:34.503
Are you gonna take me
to the hospital?

05:34.505 --> 05:36.838
No, don't stand.
I know you're pretty banged up.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.608
So we just received
the Amsterdam police report.

05:39.610 --> 05:41.310
From the bystander's accounts,

05:41.312 --> 05:43.279
you were in one heck of a scrape
at the Leidseplein.

05:43.281 --> 05:46.015
Yeah, I was.

05:46.017 --> 05:47.884
Hmm.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.853
How did you get
into Amsterdam, Mrs. Brooks?

05:50.855 --> 05:52.355
There's no flag
on your passport

05:52.357 --> 05:56.125
at the Schiphol or any
of the neighboring airports.

05:56.127 --> 05:57.726
Greece.

05:57.728 --> 06:00.496
I spent a week in the islands.

06:00.498 --> 06:03.965
Greek immigration database
is notoriously dysfunctional.

06:03.967 --> 06:06.168
Uh, I'm sorry.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.570
I'm in a--
a little bit of pain.

06:08.572 --> 06:10.238
You know,
we can finish this later.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.174
We'll set you up
in one of the infirmary bunks.

06:12.176 --> 06:13.575
And then we can circle back
to this tomorrow,

06:13.577 --> 06:16.078
once the Greek passport control
opens.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.514
- Thank you.
- Once you're more rested.

06:49.078 --> 06:51.580
I figured
you could use a ride.

06:51.582 --> 06:54.583
No.

06:54.585 --> 06:58.220
You came to say something,
so say it.

06:58.222 --> 07:00.255
Rami Haddad.

07:00.257 --> 07:02.758
He was the real target
of the drone strike, wasn't he?

07:02.760 --> 07:05.593
Bravo.

07:05.595 --> 07:07.362
Just out of curiosity,

07:07.364 --> 07:08.697
how'd you figure it out?

07:08.699 --> 07:10.799
Once the senate committee
hearings were canceled,

07:10.801 --> 07:12.267
it took all of five minutes.

07:12.269 --> 07:13.335
You told us,
you told the whole world,

07:13.337 --> 07:15.938
we took out Haddad
six years ago.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.272
But now he <i>is</i> dead.

07:17.274 --> 07:19.241
Thanks to me.

07:19.243 --> 07:20.276
And you.

07:20.278 --> 07:22.779
We made up for our mistake.

07:22.781 --> 07:25.615
You still have a job.

07:25.617 --> 07:27.384
And I'm a free man.

07:27.386 --> 07:29.986
Order has been restored.

07:29.988 --> 07:32.256
Well, maybe it seems that way
from a jail cell.

07:32.258 --> 07:36.593
But there was collateral damage
to your whole scheme.

07:36.595 --> 07:38.128
Assets killed,

07:38.130 --> 07:39.896
relations with nations frayed.

07:39.898 --> 07:42.766
Operatives mopping up the mess
even as we speak.

07:42.768 --> 07:43.867
You want to make an omelet

07:43.869 --> 07:46.469
you got to break...
a few skulls.

07:46.471 --> 07:48.570
You're done making omelets,
Henry.

07:51.307 --> 07:53.508
You're right about that.

07:53.510 --> 07:56.945
I'm content to ride off
into the sunset.

07:56.947 --> 08:00.615
And I don't need
a ride from you to get there.

08:00.617 --> 08:02.751
I want to stretch my legs.

08:10.961 --> 08:12.261
Water.

08:12.263 --> 08:14.764
You should drink something.

08:23.206 --> 08:25.440
Tabuk, where my ancestors
are from,

08:25.442 --> 08:29.210
is only 250 miles
from the kibbutz

08:29.212 --> 08:32.679
in the Negev where the IDF does
their training exercises.

08:32.682 --> 08:35.850
You and I,
we're not so different.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.352
You're wrong.

08:38.354 --> 08:40.687
We are both driven,
we...

08:40.688 --> 08:43.690
We both kill
to achieve our goals.

08:43.692 --> 08:46.227
We're exactly the same.

08:46.229 --> 08:47.361
Clever.

08:47.363 --> 08:50.031
And we're both prisoners.

08:50.033 --> 08:53.801
You have us holed up here,
miles away from Amsterdam.

08:53.803 --> 08:55.736
I hear outside, what?

08:55.738 --> 08:57.838
Two guards?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.540
When you're better off with 20.

08:59.542 --> 09:03.544
You never got
your lifeline package

09:03.546 --> 09:04.712
from daddy, did you?

09:04.714 --> 09:07.348
You're desperate, Khalid?

09:07.350 --> 09:08.583
Yeah, I've been working

09:08.585 --> 09:10.585
with a spy
from a rival agency

09:10.587 --> 09:12.186
that pursued me for weeks.

09:12.188 --> 09:14.055
You're the one
who's desperate.

09:14.057 --> 09:17.025
I have betrayed Annie's trust
more times

09:17.027 --> 09:18.560
than I care to admit.

09:18.562 --> 09:21.163
I wouldn't be surprised
if she wanted to kill me.

09:21.165 --> 09:25.235
As long as she does it
after I get what I need...

09:25.237 --> 09:28.205
That's fine with me.

11:16.228 --> 11:17.827
Sorry to surprise you
by sitting in the dark.

11:17.829 --> 11:19.929
Although for me,
it is basically just sitting.

11:19.931 --> 11:22.831
What are you doing here?

11:22.833 --> 11:25.968
You left me a voice mail.

11:25.970 --> 11:27.970
- I can explain.
- You're going to.

11:27.972 --> 11:29.171
Let's get you
out of here first.

11:35.677 --> 11:36.424
We've been over this,

11:36.425 --> 11:38.588
but I still don't understand
what you're doing.

11:38.688 --> 11:40.755
And I still don't know
why you're here.

11:40.757 --> 11:42.857
What part about
"Joan put me on the first flight

11:42.859 --> 11:43.991
"out of the Persian Gulf

11:43.993 --> 11:45.526
the second she heard
your voice mail"

11:45.528 --> 11:46.560
doesn't make sense?

11:46.562 --> 11:48.162
I don't need Agency help.

11:48.164 --> 11:50.898
No, you are way beyond that.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.367
Eyal's been taken.

11:52.369 --> 11:54.369
Let Mossad handle it.

11:56.739 --> 12:00.075
He quit Mossad.

12:00.077 --> 12:01.343
You know as well as I do,

12:01.345 --> 12:02.544
that means they are
never coming for him.

12:02.546 --> 12:04.012
No one is.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.715
We're talking about
handing over agency assets.

12:06.717 --> 12:08.717
How many names
are on that list?

12:08.719 --> 12:11.553
How many lives are we trading
for one man?

12:11.555 --> 12:14.222
Two assets in Riyadh,
one in Dubai.

12:14.224 --> 12:15.857
But they're both
collecting intel on OPEC,

12:15.859 --> 12:17.391
not the Ansari family.

12:17.393 --> 12:18.893
That distinction isn't going
to mean anything to Khalid.

12:18.895 --> 12:20.161
Can't we get them
off the board

12:20.163 --> 12:21.262
before Khalid
gets to them?

12:21.264 --> 12:23.064
Yes, but the lives
of those assets

12:23.066 --> 12:24.232
will be
irrevocably changed.

12:24.234 --> 12:26.234
I know.

12:26.236 --> 12:27.702
I pulled everything I could
off the server

12:27.704 --> 12:28.736
on the Ansari family,

12:28.738 --> 12:31.839
looking for a way around this.

12:31.841 --> 12:33.874
I can't think of another plan.

12:33.876 --> 12:36.075
I don't want
to give over those names either,

12:36.077 --> 12:37.276
but somebody has
to do something.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.112
Eyal needs my help,
and I can't do nothing.

12:40.114 --> 12:42.414
Is this about Russia?

12:42.416 --> 12:45.517
And Paris, and Zurich,
and West Virginia.

12:45.519 --> 12:47.019
It's about all of it.

12:47.021 --> 12:49.455
You once told me you didn't
have feelings for him.

12:49.457 --> 12:52.792
Is that not true?
Is that what is driving this?

12:52.794 --> 12:54.760
Why do you
keep asking me that?

12:59.933 --> 13:01.902
I have an idea.

13:01.904 --> 13:05.105
But we're not gonna violate
Agency protocol.

13:05.107 --> 13:08.075
And we are not handing over
that file.

13:08.077 --> 13:09.643
Thank you.

13:09.645 --> 13:11.778
This could get very messy.

13:11.780 --> 13:12.812
You okay with that?

13:12.814 --> 13:14.447
Yeah.

13:14.449 --> 13:16.949
This is a mistake.

13:16.951 --> 13:20.285
But at least
we'll make it together.

13:20.287 --> 13:22.654
Hey, you're here late.

13:22.656 --> 13:24.289
From the desk of the DCI.

13:26.793 --> 13:28.493
A declassification ceremony

13:28.495 --> 13:30.795
for Jai's name
on the Wall of Honor?

13:30.797 --> 13:32.564
This is a process
that normally takes years

13:32.566 --> 13:33.632
to get authorization.

13:33.634 --> 13:35.134
And Henry got it
to the top of the stack

13:35.136 --> 13:36.902
in less than a day.

13:36.904 --> 13:38.637
So what's the DCI gonna do?

13:38.639 --> 13:39.971
Punt.

13:39.973 --> 13:43.308
He gave me the authority
to grant or decline the request.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.177
He's aware
of my past with Henry.

13:45.179 --> 13:46.511
So the DCI's okay

13:46.513 --> 13:49.448
with a man being convicted
of treason on premises?

13:49.450 --> 13:51.850
His sentence was commuted,
but make no mistake about this.

13:51.852 --> 13:53.852
It is a shot across the bow.

13:53.854 --> 13:55.688
It's Henry's way of saying

13:55.690 --> 13:58.323
that he can still affect change
within this building.

13:58.325 --> 13:59.658
I have no doubt

13:59.660 --> 14:01.994
that Henry Wilcox
has bigger ambitions,

14:01.996 --> 14:04.696
but I think you need
to grant this.

14:04.698 --> 14:07.632
Henry lost a son,
we lost Jai.

14:07.634 --> 14:09.267
You know what
a declassification ceremony

14:09.269 --> 14:10.702
means to everyone around here.

14:10.704 --> 14:12.303
No, you're right.

14:12.305 --> 14:14.505
And it's important that we bring
our heroes out of the shadows.

14:14.507 --> 14:16.040
What do you want me to do?

14:16.042 --> 14:17.675
Use your discretion.

14:17.677 --> 14:20.511
Keep me posted.

14:23.550 --> 14:24.849
- Did it work?
- Of course it did.

14:24.851 --> 14:26.717
I'm that good.

14:26.719 --> 14:30.054
I have the print-outs.

14:30.056 --> 14:31.423
You uploaded more
than you said you would.

14:31.425 --> 14:33.224
The money in that satchel
was more than enough

14:33.226 --> 14:36.995
for your efforts.

14:36.997 --> 14:40.399
A "thank you"
would also be nice.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.235
Hello?

14:43.237 --> 14:46.039
Thank you.

14:46.041 --> 14:49.008
Tell your friend he's got
one heck of a right hook.

15:06.525 --> 15:08.693
Auggie!

15:09.929 --> 15:11.529
Hey!
Joost.

15:11.531 --> 15:13.564
Hey.

15:13.566 --> 15:15.232
Good to see you,
so to speak.

15:17.336 --> 15:20.104
Yes, I, uh,
got your message.

15:20.106 --> 15:21.873
Happy to help.
Thanks.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.576
Come with me.

15:28.716 --> 15:31.250
I can smell we're not
in the hash bar anymore.

15:31.252 --> 15:34.586
Much more firepower.

15:34.588 --> 15:36.221
All right, just wait.

15:42.261 --> 15:44.429
I have to say...

15:44.431 --> 15:46.398
when I got your message,

15:46.400 --> 15:49.267
I was a little bit surprised.

15:49.269 --> 15:52.604
This is very specialized.

15:52.606 --> 15:54.439
A very odd request.

15:54.441 --> 15:56.642
Are you sure
it's what you're looking for?

15:56.644 --> 16:00.446
I assure you it is.

16:00.448 --> 16:02.548
Fair enough.

16:05.119 --> 16:07.120
You'll need this as well.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.466
If you don't have
what I need,

16:19.468 --> 16:21.602
this will be a very short,
painful conversation.

16:21.604 --> 16:23.471
I have it.

16:23.473 --> 16:25.973
The meeting place will be
3:00 p.m.

16:25.975 --> 16:27.275
at the southern end
of the oude--

16:27.277 --> 16:28.477
No. New rules.

16:28.479 --> 16:30.479
I set the time and place.

16:30.481 --> 16:32.281
People who are negotiating

16:32.283 --> 16:35.317
for the lives of hostages
don't get to dictate terms.

16:35.319 --> 16:36.819
These are my rules.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.154
I need the safety of a crowd.

16:38.156 --> 16:39.455
Public place.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.290
Bloemenmarkt, noon today.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.658
If you're trying
to call my bluff,

16:42.660 --> 16:44.126
know that I've killed before.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.162
The only way you're gonna get
what you want

16:46.164 --> 16:47.363
is if you go with my plan.

16:47.365 --> 16:49.298
I'll see you at noon.

16:56.839 --> 16:58.540
We're on.

16:58.542 --> 16:59.541
You got quiet
all of a sudden.

16:59.543 --> 17:01.176
I know, I just...

17:01.178 --> 17:04.213
I want this to work.
It will.

17:04.214 --> 17:06.781
I had a Sergeant
in basic training.

17:06.784 --> 17:08.184
Mean son of a bitch,

17:08.185 --> 17:10.720
but he taught us one thing
that really stuck with me.

17:10.722 --> 17:14.391
Going into battle is like
blowing out a birthday candle.

17:14.393 --> 17:15.858
Okay, that doesn't help me,

17:15.861 --> 17:17.394
because I have
no idea what it means.

17:17.396 --> 17:19.530
It means
"Don't overthink it."

17:19.531 --> 17:22.165
Put all the noisy thoughts
out of your head.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.068
Close your eyes.

17:24.069 --> 17:27.070
Think about one positive thing
that you want.

17:31.343 --> 17:35.012
Or one thing you love.

17:38.151 --> 17:39.717
Okay, I'm ready.

18:14.921 --> 18:15.954
It's a go.

18:15.956 --> 18:17.689
They're at your 10 o'clock.

18:23.295 --> 18:25.896
Oh, sorry, sorry,
I'm a bit lost.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.598
Do you know how to get
to pier 10?

18:31.270 --> 18:32.770
Hey, man!

18:32.772 --> 18:35.740
Look, you could just say no.

18:35.742 --> 18:37.108
Jerk.

18:37.110 --> 18:38.609
Uh, excuse me.

18:49.787 --> 18:51.755
Annie Walker.

18:51.757 --> 18:54.124
Eyal's description
of your tenacity

18:54.126 --> 18:55.292
didn't do you justice.

18:55.294 --> 18:56.493
Let's leave the notion
of justice

18:56.495 --> 18:58.829
out of this entirely.

18:58.831 --> 19:01.899
Seems inappropriate.
Agreed.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.636
That's for me, I presume?

19:05.638 --> 19:07.405
This wasn't easy
to get, you know.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.740
I know.

19:08.742 --> 19:10.641
That's why I asked someone
with something to lose.

19:10.643 --> 19:12.810
That was the one flaw
in your plan, Khalid.

19:12.812 --> 19:15.279
Assuming I had something
to lose.

19:15.281 --> 19:16.847
You've been counting
on my feelings for Eyal

19:16.849 --> 19:18.282
to drive this negotiation.

19:18.284 --> 19:20.318
But he works
for a rival agency.

19:20.320 --> 19:24.488
What's in this file,
is what he's worth to me alive.

19:24.490 --> 19:27.125
No more, no less.

19:37.503 --> 19:39.504
Is this some kind of joke?

19:39.506 --> 19:40.505
Far from it.

19:40.507 --> 19:43.542
Annie, don't.
Annie!

20:49.565 --> 20:50.797
You couldn't find
a closer pier?

20:50.799 --> 20:53.066
For a sighted guy,
you sure are slow.

20:53.068 --> 20:55.268
Yeah?

20:55.270 --> 20:57.236
For a blind guy,
you sure are crazy.

20:57.238 --> 20:58.938
This was a ridiculous plan.

20:58.940 --> 21:00.139
Agreed.

21:00.141 --> 21:02.241
Where's Annie?

21:02.243 --> 21:04.143
Have to assume, en route.

22:09.675 --> 22:11.142
We shove off in two minutes.

22:11.144 --> 22:12.310
If she isn't here,

22:12.312 --> 22:14.045
we meet up
at the old church in Delft.

22:14.047 --> 22:15.480
She knows the protocol.

22:15.482 --> 22:16.982
But you wouldn't leave her.

22:16.984 --> 22:21.019
I'd never leave her.

22:21.021 --> 22:22.687
I would
never leave her either.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.856
- Go!
- Where is she?

22:24.858 --> 22:27.192
- Gun it! Go!
- She's coming, she's good.

22:27.194 --> 22:28.827
- Come on! Come on!
- Start.

22:28.829 --> 22:31.196
- Got it, Annie!
- Come on! Come on!

22:33.867 --> 22:35.567
- Go!
- Come on!

22:35.569 --> 22:36.569
Come on,
you got it, baby.

22:36.571 --> 22:38.237
Oh, I got you.

22:47.182 --> 22:48.548
Are you okay?

22:48.550 --> 22:50.416
Yeah.

22:52.387 --> 22:54.721
What were you waiting for?

22:54.723 --> 22:57.991
Waiting for you,<i>neshama.</i>

23:03.765 --> 23:05.033
Do you see any tulips?

23:05.035 --> 23:08.036
Not this time of year.

23:08.038 --> 23:12.441
I'm gonna pretend
there are tulips and windmills.

23:12.443 --> 23:14.743
One of the benefits
of being blind.

23:14.745 --> 23:17.779
I can imagine the way
things look any way I like.

23:17.781 --> 23:19.581
People too?

23:19.583 --> 23:20.915
Of course.

23:20.917 --> 23:23.551
One of these days,
I'll describe you to yourself.

23:23.553 --> 23:24.953
It's a hell of a parlor game.

23:24.955 --> 23:27.589
That's a plan.

23:27.591 --> 23:31.292
This plan, on the other hand,
was risky.

23:31.294 --> 23:34.129
I wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.

23:34.131 --> 23:35.597
Didn't like
that feeling much.

23:35.599 --> 23:37.398
You were worried about me?

23:37.400 --> 23:38.633
Yeah, I was worried.

23:38.635 --> 23:40.802
Then you didn't follow
your Sergeant's advice.

23:40.804 --> 23:43.271
My sergeant's advice
didn't work.

23:43.273 --> 23:45.139
Because the person
I was worried about

23:45.141 --> 23:47.643
and the positive thing
I was thinking about

23:47.645 --> 23:51.446
are the same.

23:58.655 --> 24:00.422
Hello.

24:00.424 --> 24:03.458
Yeah.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.794
Okay, she's right here.

24:05.796 --> 24:07.996
I'll put her on.

24:07.998 --> 24:10.065
- Hello?
- Annie.

24:10.067 --> 24:12.334
What is the status
on Khalid?

24:12.336 --> 24:13.836
The status?

24:13.838 --> 24:16.172
Well...

24:16.174 --> 24:17.640
We're safe on a barge,

24:17.642 --> 24:19.109
headed to the North Sea

24:19.111 --> 24:20.243
to meet up
with the USS <i>Yorktown.</i>

24:20.245 --> 24:21.778
And Khalid is really
in the wind?

24:21.780 --> 24:24.314
Yeah.

24:24.316 --> 24:25.982
Why?

24:25.984 --> 24:27.984
We just got
off the phone with AIVD.

24:27.986 --> 24:30.687
Some unfortunate news.
What happened?

24:30.689 --> 24:33.189
Apparently
Saudi Foreign Affairs Ministry

24:33.191 --> 24:35.858
has been working back channels
with Dutch authorities.

24:35.860 --> 24:38.295
- I know where this is headed.
- A deal has been reached.

24:38.297 --> 24:40.530
Khalid has been taken off
all the Interpol watch lists.

24:40.532 --> 24:42.499
He'll be going back
to Saudi Arabia,

24:42.501 --> 24:44.634
where he'll be
virtually untouchable.

24:44.636 --> 24:46.337
An hour from now,

24:46.339 --> 24:48.138
a diplomatic helicopter's
gonna take him

24:48.140 --> 24:50.341
from the Osdorp estate
to a waiting jet.

24:50.343 --> 24:52.310
And, from there,
he'll be flown home.

24:52.312 --> 24:55.012
Okay.

24:55.014 --> 24:57.281
I understand.

25:01.887 --> 25:03.687
Hmm.

25:03.689 --> 25:06.023
Khalid's going home.

25:06.025 --> 25:08.726
The Saudi government made
a deal with the Dutch.

25:08.728 --> 25:11.195
His father probably pulled
the strings.

25:11.197 --> 25:12.563
Oil trumps everything.

25:12.565 --> 25:13.898
Especially justice.

25:13.900 --> 25:16.067
The important thing is
we all got out of this

25:16.069 --> 25:19.036
alive and unhurt.

25:19.038 --> 25:20.037
I don't think this is over.

25:20.039 --> 25:21.705
What are you talking about?

25:21.707 --> 25:24.875
CIA wants me to finish this.

25:24.877 --> 25:26.710
To kill Khalid.

25:26.712 --> 25:28.912
- Annie, listen to yourself.
- Think about it.

25:28.914 --> 25:30.347
They send you here to help me.

25:30.349 --> 25:33.183
Why?
Because I care.

25:33.185 --> 25:34.718
No, because they want me
to mop up the mess.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.053
- I'll do it.
- No.

25:36.055 --> 25:37.487
We did not
just risk our lives

25:37.489 --> 25:39.522
so either one of you could go
on a suicide mission.

25:39.524 --> 25:41.558
We have a plan,
we're sticking to it.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.361
Why did they tell me
exactly where he is right now

25:44.363 --> 25:45.862
and when he's leaving?

25:45.864 --> 25:49.065
Annie, you are frustrated
and upset, and I get it.

25:49.067 --> 25:52.736
It is unjust and obscene
that Khalid is going home.

25:52.738 --> 25:56.240
But nobody wants you to
or <i>needs</i> you to kill him.

26:29.942 --> 26:32.878
Annie!

26:36.782 --> 26:39.784
I'll go check on her.

26:43.155 --> 26:46.157
Annie.

26:55.901 --> 26:57.935
She's gone.
What do you mean, she's gone?

26:57.937 --> 26:59.303
She's gone.

26:59.305 --> 27:01.038
She took the gun I got
off of one of Khalid's guys.

27:03.975 --> 27:06.244
What are you doing, Annie?

29:03.268 --> 29:04.767
Release your fingers.

29:04.769 --> 29:09.438
And get up slowly.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.740
Very slowly.

29:19.815 --> 29:21.917
You'll never get away
with this.

29:21.919 --> 29:23.251
Get away with what?

29:23.253 --> 29:26.154
You have no idea what I want.

29:26.156 --> 29:29.257
This is no longer
a negotiation.

29:29.259 --> 29:30.759
You no longer have leverage.

29:30.761 --> 29:34.129
When I say something,
you do it.

29:34.131 --> 29:35.964
Or I shoot you.

29:37.801 --> 29:39.635
Is that clear?

29:39.637 --> 29:42.437
Yes.

29:45.141 --> 29:46.341
Killing you would be

29:46.343 --> 29:47.643
the easiest thing
in the world, right now.

29:47.645 --> 29:50.012
But it won't solve anything.

29:50.014 --> 29:51.747
So why are you here?

29:51.749 --> 29:55.517
If not to kill me?

29:55.519 --> 29:58.253
I'm here on behalf of Megan.

30:02.327 --> 30:03.994
How could that be?

30:03.996 --> 30:05.662
You killed her.

30:05.664 --> 30:06.697
No, I didn't.

30:06.699 --> 30:08.665
The CIA did.

30:08.667 --> 30:11.335
When I tell you who did it,
you're gonna realize...

30:11.337 --> 30:13.170
how insignificant you are.

30:17.142 --> 30:19.844
This is from the CIA file
on your dad's company.

30:27.386 --> 30:30.855
You recognize that man?

30:30.857 --> 30:32.690
That's my father's bodyguard.

30:32.692 --> 30:35.159
He killed Megan.

30:35.161 --> 30:37.361
I saw him.

30:37.363 --> 30:39.530
Your father ordered it.

30:39.532 --> 30:40.598
This is impossible.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.501
My father told me
it was the CIA.

30:42.503 --> 30:44.169
Look at the file.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.374
I know what real love is.

30:48.376 --> 30:52.477
I saw that in Megan's eyes
when she talked about you.

30:52.479 --> 30:55.314
Your father took that.

30:59.886 --> 31:02.254
Why?

31:02.256 --> 31:06.392
Perhaps he disapproved
of your engagement.

31:06.394 --> 31:10.564
Perhaps he assumed
she was a spy.

31:10.566 --> 31:13.200
Regardless...

31:13.202 --> 31:16.237
he had her killed.

31:16.239 --> 31:19.707
You think you're his good son?

31:19.709 --> 31:21.576
His faithful servant?

31:21.578 --> 31:22.944
His trusted advisor?

31:22.946 --> 31:24.379
To him...

31:24.381 --> 31:26.548
you're nothing.

31:26.550 --> 31:28.417
You're gonna get
on that helicopter

31:28.419 --> 31:31.520
and you're gonna be filled
with anger and questions.

31:31.522 --> 31:32.755
And on the long ride home,

31:32.757 --> 31:36.625
I want you to remember
that day in Paris,

31:36.627 --> 31:38.427
when you first told Megan
you loved her,

31:38.429 --> 31:41.630
and what that felt like.

31:41.632 --> 31:45.066
You want a list of the names
that betrayed you?

31:45.068 --> 31:47.736
Look no farther
than your father.

31:47.738 --> 31:50.272
He's the root of your problem.

31:50.274 --> 31:52.207
What you do
with that information

31:52.209 --> 31:55.711
is up to you.

32:10.593 --> 32:12.326
- Annie!
- Are you all right?

32:12.328 --> 32:14.828
I'm all right.
I didn't kill him.

32:14.830 --> 32:16.297
He's gone.

32:32.136 --> 32:33.683
Why Athens?

32:33.684 --> 32:35.185
Well, I got
a 40-foot mariner ketch,

32:35.187 --> 32:36.920
in Piraeus,
with my name on it.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.554
No, seriously.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.256
It's called the <i>flying Lavin.</i>

32:40.258 --> 32:41.391
You're dyed-in-the-wool
Mossad.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.458
Are you sure
you're gonna be happy

32:42.460 --> 32:44.093
sitting around
on a boat all day?

32:44.095 --> 32:46.395
Sitting?
It's called sailing.

32:46.397 --> 32:51.200
And much of Jewish mysticism
revolves around numbers.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.068
The five knots in a tzitzit.

32:53.070 --> 32:54.136
The ten Sephirot.

32:54.138 --> 32:57.373
The four species of <i>Sukkot.</i>

32:57.375 --> 33:00.343
But we only get one life.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.944
I want to make
the best of it.

33:01.946 --> 33:04.514
Why do I always feel like
there's something

33:04.516 --> 33:06.283
behind what you're telling me?

33:06.285 --> 33:08.885
Why don't you join me
and find out?

33:08.887 --> 33:10.754
The last time a guy asked me
to run away with him,

33:10.756 --> 33:14.725
it didn't end that well.

33:14.727 --> 33:17.260
Besides, I need to get home.

33:17.262 --> 33:19.796
Put down some roots.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.097
For now.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.932
Timing is everything, <i>neshama.</i>

33:24.236 --> 33:28.405
But one day, you and I
will be sitting somewhere,

33:28.407 --> 33:32.476
looking at a sunset,
thinking of nothing at all.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.478
Maybe not this boat in Greece,

33:34.480 --> 33:36.746
but--but one day.

33:38.616 --> 33:41.618
And then that will be
a lovely evening.

33:43.955 --> 33:47.792
I hope so.

33:47.794 --> 33:50.461
Good-bye, Eyal.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.963
I'm not good with good-byes.

33:52.965 --> 33:55.833
And I never get to say it.

33:55.835 --> 33:57.501
Thank you, Annie.

33:57.503 --> 34:01.605
Good luck.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.204
Hey.

34:32.206 --> 34:35.040
You wanna grab a drink
when we get back?

34:35.042 --> 34:36.507
Sure.

34:36.510 --> 34:38.543
A beer at Allen's
sounds good.

34:38.545 --> 34:41.045
I was thinking
someplace nicer.

34:41.047 --> 34:44.983
Someplace nicer?

34:44.985 --> 34:46.951
Friday night at 8:00?

34:49.286 --> 34:52.155
Sure.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.748
There are 104 stars
on this wall.

35:16.750 --> 35:20.185
104 stories.

35:20.187 --> 35:23.922
Patriotism and courage.

35:23.924 --> 35:25.557
The rigors of our profession
don't allow us

35:25.559 --> 35:29.895
to declassify all the names
for all the stars.

35:29.897 --> 35:32.364
Which is why an occasion
like this...

35:32.366 --> 35:35.868
is as uplifting
as it is solemn.

35:35.870 --> 35:38.104
Today, we acknowledge

35:38.106 --> 35:40.206
that one of the stars
on this wall

35:40.208 --> 35:42.408
represents Jai Wilcox:

35:42.410 --> 35:44.777
son of Henry Wilcox

35:44.779 --> 35:47.013
and a fine CIA officer.

35:57.858 --> 36:00.259
Thank you, Arthur.

36:00.261 --> 36:02.294
I'm sorry for your loss,
Henry.

36:02.296 --> 36:04.864
No you're not.

37:20.141 --> 37:21.675
Yes.

37:21.677 --> 37:24.178
I know this is macabre.

37:24.180 --> 37:28.549
But I wanted
to see this place for myself.

37:28.551 --> 37:30.551
Please have a seat.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.357
Thank you for coming.

37:36.359 --> 37:40.127
I know this couldn't be easy.

37:40.129 --> 37:43.497
It isn't.

37:43.499 --> 37:48.201
Everything in here is
exactly as it was before.

37:48.203 --> 37:50.871
Life has a funny way
of continuing on...

37:50.873 --> 37:54.207
no matter what we do.

37:54.209 --> 37:58.245
I know Jai didn't paint
the rosiest picture of me.

37:58.247 --> 37:59.914
But, please...

37:59.916 --> 38:02.183
I'm here to try
to make things right.

38:02.185 --> 38:05.887
Mr. Wilcox, you and I
only ever met once.

38:05.889 --> 38:08.557
I never felt
we had any personal issue.

38:08.559 --> 38:10.225
This is about
Arthur and Joan Campbell.

38:10.227 --> 38:13.028
I don't have any personal
issues with them either.

38:16.233 --> 38:19.869
Let me ask you something.

38:19.871 --> 38:23.405
Why didn't you kill Khalid
in Amsterdam?

38:23.407 --> 38:27.109
Yes, I know about Khalid.

38:27.111 --> 38:31.380
Just assume I know everything.

38:34.751 --> 38:37.252
I gave Khalid
all the information he needs...

38:37.254 --> 38:38.720
for him to kill his father,

38:38.722 --> 38:41.223
or force his father
to kill him.

38:41.225 --> 38:43.426
Either way, we get
a piece off the game board

38:43.428 --> 38:45.128
and cause havoc
in their ranks.

38:45.130 --> 38:48.698
And it can't be traced back
to the Agency.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.468
Excellent spycraft,
Miss Walker.

38:51.470 --> 38:54.438
My experience with Lena
taught me a few things.

38:54.440 --> 38:58.776
I knew you were
the right person for this.

39:01.279 --> 39:03.113
Open it.

39:03.115 --> 39:05.449
It'd be worth your while.

39:05.451 --> 39:08.085
I'm sorry, but...

39:08.087 --> 39:10.955
whatever it is
you'd like me to do...

39:10.957 --> 39:13.290
I won't go
against Joan and Arthur.

39:13.292 --> 39:14.625
Take a look.

39:33.446 --> 39:35.981
Is everything in here
accurate?

39:35.983 --> 39:38.951
Very much so.

39:44.524 --> 39:46.592
I'm in.

39:58.005 --> 40:00.173
Walker! You home?

40:04.512 --> 40:07.181
You know we're not grabbing
that beer until Friday, right?

40:07.183 --> 40:10.351
Yeah, yeah.

40:10.353 --> 40:12.152
You know,
ordinarily this is

40:12.154 --> 40:15.188
the moment where I'd
make some quip

40:15.190 --> 40:16.856
about how I got
on the wrong bus

40:16.858 --> 40:20.827
or taken the wrong turn
at Albuquerque.

40:20.829 --> 40:22.362
What's going on?

40:23.465 --> 40:25.698
I've been thinking
about today.

40:25.700 --> 40:28.000
About our lives.

40:28.002 --> 40:30.503
There's nothing certain
about what we do.

40:30.505 --> 40:34.540
There's nothing certain
for people like us.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.175
Now, there's a conversation
I've been hoping

40:36.177 --> 40:37.977
to have with you
for a while now,

40:37.979 --> 40:39.878
but I've never found
the right time to have it.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.814
What are you saying?

40:44.918 --> 40:47.385
Timing's everything.

40:47.387 --> 40:52.223
I wanted to talk now, Annie.

40:52.225 --> 40:54.492
What do you want
to talk about?

41:26.759 --> 41:29.361
I'm glad we're having
this talk.
