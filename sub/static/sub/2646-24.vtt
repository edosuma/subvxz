Wilt Chamberlain shows up.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.700
He says, "Can you take a little
off the top for my friend here?"

12:22.826 --> 12:24.785
And it's Elvis.
No way.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.706
Greatest singer that ever lived,
after Sinatra. I'll fight
any man who says different.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.668
My dad says the greatest singer
who ever lived is Peabo Bryson.

Yeah, I guess.

Let's just do
the picture another day.
I think I'm getting a pimple.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.573
No. Do you know
how long it took me
to book this photographer?

13:04.034 --> 13:06.577
Maybe by the fireplace.

13:06.662 --> 13:10.164
Yeah. That's a classic
old-person spot for a portrait.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.875
Yeah, if I'd ever bothered
to paint that hideous wall.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.671

Dad, can you call them again?
I just did.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.836
They're on their way.
Game went into overtime.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.379
I know,
but we're losing the light,

13:58.463 --> 14:00.673

to a bar mitzvah in 10 minutes.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.508
Oh, red wine. Really? Now?

14:02.592 --> 14:05.469
You know, honey,
I think you're getting
a little too uptight about this.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.264
It's hard to breathe.
Oh, you're fine.

14:08.390 --> 14:12.268
What'd you do to him?
He's turning blue.
But his clothes will stay white.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.854
- We're home!
- Oh, thank God.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.564

[Phil]
Hey, there's my beautiful wife.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.236
I know you're mad at me,
and I know this foam finger
can't make up for everything.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.864
Honey, you just go change,
and we'll talk about
what you did later.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.241
Hey, thank you so much
for those tickets.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.535

had a real good time.

Oh! I should- I should
come by and kiss that step-
fix that step.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.419
Oh, you're acting like
I wanted to destroy the house.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.921
No. I just think it's odd
that the majority of things
you destroyed...

14:41.006 --> 14:42.673
were sent to us by my mom.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.800
Okay, okay, okay.
So while I'm fighting off
that filthy creature,

14:44.885 --> 14:46.927
I actually stop and say,
"Oh, you know what,

14:47.012 --> 14:50.473
here's the opportunity
I've always been looking for to
destroy our kitschiest objects."

14:50.557 --> 14:52.183
Kitschiest?
Oh, she's gonna love that.

14:52.267 --> 14:55.019
If you would've come with me
to the wedding, none of this
would have happened.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.730
Okay. So you are angry.
Mitchell, I get it.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.899
You're terrified of
small talk and birds.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.485
You're just lucky
that pigeon didn't want to
chat you up about the weather.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.028
Hello, Jay.
Hello, guys.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.990

15:10.994 --> 15:12.787
Dad, really?
That is not a compliment.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.998
That's why I wanted you
to try those on earlier.
Turn around.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.125
The picture can't happen today.
My pimple's getting worse.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.419
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
Can you stand?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.505
Yeah.
Well, then the picture's
happening.

15:22.631 --> 15:27.176
It's all anybody's gonna see.
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.846
Did you get a look
at her dress?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.265
What? Why would I look
at her dress? I love you.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.476
Uh, Mrs. Dunphy,
the sun is setting.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.145
Okay. Yeah, this is happening.
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.398
Be careful. I stained
some furniture out there
this afternoon.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.943
Of course you did, Dad.
Anything else I need
to know about?

15:44.027 --> 15:46.237
Maybe the neighbors
on either side are having
a paintball fight.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.657
Now watch this.
Dad, in his infinite wisdom,
stained furniture today.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.617
Don't touch it. It's wet.

[Claire]
Hurry, hurry.
Put that down, sweetheart.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.914
Okay. Okay, we got it.
Now we're gonna go out here.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.542
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.544
How do- How do you
turn the sprinklers off?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.671
¡Ay! Of course!
Because I'm Latina,

16:03.755 --> 16:06.215
I'm supposed to know everything
about gardening and sprinklers!

16:06.299 --> 16:08.551
You were here
when they installed it.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.804
Ay, yeah.
The box is across the yard.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.057
You mean
your now-soaking-wet yard?
That's great. We are screwed.

16:15.142 --> 16:19.478
No, we're not.
We haven't unwrapped
our secret weapon yet.

Hurt Locker style...

16:23.024 --> 16:28.737

or not boom- water off.

ones down front-
You know what, sir?

16:59.186 --> 17:01.812

Come on, people, let's get out here.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.064

to unwrap your brother.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.650

over on this side.

but if ever you're
in my arms again-

17:18.371 --> 17:20.705
Phil, not now.
Yes, now. I don't want
to look at this picture...

17:20.790 --> 17:22.374
when I'm 80 years old
and you're long dead...

17:22.459 --> 17:24.627
and know that you were angry
at me when we took it.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.212
Phil, we'll talk about
what you did later.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.005
Okay, everybody.
Eyes over here.

17:28.131 --> 17:32.218

Who kissed you?
Gloria.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.639
What?
It was the kiss cam.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.808
Why did you kiss Cam?
No, I kissed Phil.
He told me I had to.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.810
No, no.
Okay, hang on a second.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.521
Was this before or after
you ignored the phone call
from your wife?

17:44.606 --> 17:46.607
You saw that too?
Mmm.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.902
Could we please just take
the damn picture?

17:49.986 --> 17:52.238
Okay. Everybody,
one more time.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.115
Just so you know,
I am angry with you.
I knew it!

17:55.200 --> 17:57.409
- Oh, damn it!
- It was a big day for me,

17:57.494 --> 17:59.703
and he didn't want to go
because he doesn't like
small talk.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.705
Would it be terribly inconvenient...

18:01.790 --> 18:03.874
to just postpone this hissy fit
for a few minutes?

18:03.959 --> 18:06.919
- Maybe some of us don't
want to take a picture today.
- Thank you.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.630

to make Mitchell do something
he doesn't wanna do.

to put together,

who kissed who and who's got
a pimple on her head...

inappropriate dress.

Ah, this is ridiculous.
You're both uptight about everything.

18:37.867 --> 18:42.121
You didn't want to go to
a wedding with him because you
didn't want to make small talk?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.915
That's how I met Gloria.
Do you remember the first thing
I said to you?

18:45.000 --> 18:50.170
Yes. "I like chocolate,
I like fruit, but not together."

with that, lvy League? And you.
