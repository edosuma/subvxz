04:24.080 --> 04:26.036
He's got no stamina.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.798
- I love your nose.
- Thanks, Apple.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.312
I wanted to get my nose done
since I was ten,

04:34.400 --> 04:36.914
but it wasn't as simple as thought.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.835
The doctors found out I didn't have
any cartilage in the tip of my nose,

04:41.920 --> 04:43.876
so then we had to do that.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.836
My nose was too long,
so we had to shorten it.

04:47.920 --> 04:53.119
And then it was too wide,
so we had to thin it.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.674
And it was just a lot more complicated
than I thought.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.991
My nose was just an insane amount
of money.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.877
I mean, I was shocked.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.317
I thought that a nose job
was only, like, three or four grand,

05:07.400 --> 05:09.311
but I was wrong.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.313
Mine was, like,
three times that amount.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.756
I mean, my girlfriend's
breast enlargement

05:16.840 --> 05:20.116
was, like, four or five grand.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.316
I mean, it's not like
I ever felt them, but...

05:27.440 --> 05:32.036
They actually look kinda real,
you know?

05:34.960 --> 05:38.589
<i>So your own wife, who's hot,</i>
<i>by the way, with big jugs,</i>

05:38.680 --> 05:40.033
<i>won't even go down on you?</i>

05:40.160 --> 05:42.628
<i>You can call my girlfriend</i>
<i>and she'll tell you,</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:44.915
<i>and I've been with her</i>
<i>for quite a while,</i>

05:45.000 --> 05:48.754
<i>and she will tell you she goes down</i>
<i>on me every time we're together.</i>

06:52.240 --> 06:54.754
You're a disgrace to white folks.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.713
Christ!

08:01.920 --> 08:03.990
Where's my wallet?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.433
Where's my wallet?

08:12.520 --> 08:15.114
- On the dresser.
- Hi, Sister Jean, it's Joe.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.959
Sure.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.875
How can you spend a thousand bucks
on a 976 line?

08:22.960 --> 08:26.111
I don't get it. You're Joseph Scott,
who every woman wants,

08:26.200 --> 08:28.156
and you waste your money
on a 976 line.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.755
Cos I can pretend to be someone else.

08:31.840 --> 08:36.072
Not you, Sister Jean, someone else.
I need some tickets.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.277
I'm at home. Now?

08:41.679 --> 08:44.911
Great, thank you.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye. Bye.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.152
Don't you have any philosophies
in life apart from self-indulgence?

08:49.240 --> 08:51.959
You're the most self-indulgent fool
I've ever met.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.918
- I thought you'd given up.
- I did give up.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.874
And then I started again. Feel this.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.470
- What?
- Feel this. It's a lump.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.959
Feel that lump? You feel it?
There? There!

09:07.040 --> 09:08.951
It's cancer.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.639
Breast cancer.
Can men get breast cancer?

09:14.680 --> 09:19.390
Do they give men mastectomies?
I've got something down there as well.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.870
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes, and he's a fucking idiot!

09:22.960 --> 09:24.712
It's cancer.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.593
- So where is it?
- What?

09:29.680 --> 09:31.875
- My wallet!
- On the dresser.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.632
- No, it isn't.
- It is.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.350
What the fuck is that?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.989
- That would be a dog.
- Why the fuck is it in my house?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.359
Apple!

09:49.320 --> 09:51.470
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Apple.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.790
- <i>Hi, Joe.</i>
- Why did you leave your dog here?

09:53.880 --> 09:55.677
- <i>You said I could.</i>
- No, I didn't.

09:55.760 --> 10:00.436
<i>Yes, you did. I'll pick him up at the</i>
<i>restaurant after your lunch meeting.</i>

10:00.520 --> 10:02.715
I'm not taking that dog to lunch
with me.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.917
<i>Don't bring him into the restaurant.</i>
<i>Leave him in the car.</i>

10:06.000 --> 10:07.797
<i>I'll be there at two.</i>

10:09.200 --> 10:10.872
You better.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.394
Is it cocktail hour yet?

10:40.120 --> 10:42.554
Well, it is somewhere!

10:49.960 --> 10:51.518
I'm handing in my notice.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.159
Why?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.510
It's so much fun here.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.912
How much?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.719
- It's not about the money.
- How much?

11:03.800 --> 11:06.837
When I show up here,
I never know what to expect.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.959
Whether you've eaten mushrooms
or acid or coke or all of the above.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.350
You know what they call you?
Captain Wacky.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.351
Captain Wacky.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.228
You know, I really don't like
looking at myself through your eyes.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.032
Another 500.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.594
I'm not happy.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.637
Your happiness doesn't interest me.
Mine does.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.353
600.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.752
700.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.153
- OK.
- That's a month, not a week.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.668
Yes?

12:37.080 --> 12:39.150
- Yes?
- <i>Hi!</i>

12:53.680 --> 12:56.353
Hi! You look terrific.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.512
So do you. Welcome. Come in.
Nice to see you.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.877
My apartment block was shaking
last night. Did you feel it?

13:03.960 --> 13:05.757
No.

13:05.840 --> 13:09.071
I thought it was gonna fall in
and I was gonna die.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.998
Five, right?

13:13.760 --> 13:17.958
You have the fires and you have
the floods and you have the riots...

13:19.720 --> 13:22.439
And then you have
the drive-by shootings.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.955
Fires, floods, earthquakes, riots.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.917
I drove by a body on my way here
just lying on the sidewalk.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.798
We don't need to go to the movies.
We live in a movie.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.989
We do!

13:35.080 --> 13:38.356
I live here, but I can't find
a good thing to say about it.

13:38.440 --> 13:43.468
If I close my eyes and picture it,
all I see is one big varicose vein.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.518
You got yourself a dog!

13:50.600 --> 13:53.239
It's good to have animals.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.518
I have two dogs, two cats
and a green lizard.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.990
I had two boa constrictors
that I got when they were babies.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.435
They were always
getting out of their tank.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.559
When they got to about six foot,
one wrapped itself around the treadmill.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.313
- I turned it on and it got flattened!
- No!

14:10.400 --> 14:13.437
I've had so many animals,
you wouldn't believe it.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.873
Snakes, eh?

14:17.360 --> 14:19.430
Well, I'd better be going.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.958
You're not into smack?
I got some straight off the boat.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.314
No.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.595
Smack junkies
never seem to get bored.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.912
They can look at their shoes for eight
hours and still have a good time.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.956
I envy that.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.235
Well, it's nice to see you, Joe.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.039
Nice to see you, Sister Jean.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.791
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem. I'll see you soon. Bye.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.677
Bye-bye now.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.514
Will you help me with this dog?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.555
What do you mean "help"?

14:59.640 --> 15:02.029
If people see me with it,
they'll think I'm gay.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.759
- See? That was easy.
- Why didn't you do it yourself?

15:04.840 --> 15:07.912
I'm meeting an important director.
I don't want hairs on me.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.995
- Oh, Christ!
- Oh, my God!

15:11.080 --> 15:12.593
- Christ!
- Can we help?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.877
I'm sorry! Fucking dog! I'm so sorry.
We're fine, thank you.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.678
I was talking to the lady!

15:17.760 --> 15:20.593
If you need a witness
to that assault, I'd be...

15:20.680 --> 15:24.753
What are you talking about? It wasn't
an assault, it was an accident.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.230
That was no accident. It was
an unprovoked, vicious attack!

15:28.320 --> 15:30.356
I'm calling the police right now!

15:30.440 --> 15:32.795
It was an accident!
I wouldn't hit her.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.668
I saw you and I know you.
I know all about you, Joe Scott.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.275
Put your cellphone away.
It was an accident, not an assault.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.920
You ladies are old enough
to know the difference.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.719
If you don't get outta here,
there will be an assault!

15:45.800 --> 15:50.112
We were trying to help! He shouldn't get
away with it! You should report him!

15:50.200 --> 15:53.670
You saw what you wanted to see!
Get outta here! You understand me?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.197
God!

16:04.120 --> 16:05.872
Put that on your nose.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.198
Come and sit down.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.756
Step in.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.872
There you go. Steady.
Put your head back. There you go.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.514
I... I'll make you some tea, shall I?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.875
You don't know how to make tea.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.108
- You're gonna leave me, aren't you?
- What?

16:39.360 --> 16:40.554
You're gonna leave me.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.234
Are you gonna stand there
with your thumb up your ass

16:43.320 --> 16:44.878
or are you gonna get the phone?

16:44.960 --> 16:48.748
Is that a roundabout way of saying
you don't wanna discuss it right now?

16:49.440 --> 16:50.668
- Hello?
- <i>Joe?</i>

16:50.760 --> 16:52.751
- Hi, Mum.
- <i>You picked up the phone!</i>

16:52.840 --> 16:55.308
- <i>Where's Ophelia?</i>
- Busy. Can I call you back?

16:55.400 --> 16:59.075
- I'm in the middle of something.
- <i>Joe, I've got some bad news.</i>

16:59.160 --> 17:01.071
- What, are you OK?
- <i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

17:01.160 --> 17:04.152
- Is Peggy OK?
- <i>No, Peggy's fine.</i>

17:04.240 --> 17:06.435
<i>I hate to tell you this</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

17:06.520 --> 17:08.157
Just tell me!

17:10.800 --> 17:11.993
Mum?

17:13.359 --> 17:16.511
- Mum, are you there?
- <i>Oh, dear...</i>

17:16.599 --> 17:19.512
- For God's sake, tell me!
- <i>Joe, I'm so sorry.</i>

17:19.599 --> 17:21.750
Just tell me, Mum, please.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.910
<i>Boots has died.</i>

17:25.160 --> 17:26.752
What?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.518
<i>Boots has died.</i>

17:31.520 --> 17:34.637
When... Boots has died?

17:34.720 --> 17:38.030
- When?
- <i>Yesterday. It happened yesterday.</i>

17:38.120 --> 17:40.156
<i>I'm so sorry, Joe.</i>

17:42.600 --> 17:43.828
How?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.758
<i>They're not sure yet.</i>
<i>There has to be an autopsy.</i>

17:51.760 --> 17:53.671
<i>Joe?</i>

17:53.760 --> 17:56.035
Yeah. Yeah, Mum, I'm here.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.717
<i>They're holding the funeral</i>
<i>at Saint Joseph's.</i>

18:01.800 --> 18:06.237
<i>Ruth would love you to come,</i>
<i>but she understands if you're too busy.</i>

18:08.640 --> 18:11.313
<i>Joe, it's been such a shock to her.</i>

18:11.400 --> 18:14.790
<i>He wasn't even ill. There was no</i>
<i>warning that this was coming.</i>

18:17.760 --> 18:20.513
<i>I feel terrible telling you this</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

18:24.320 --> 18:26.880
<i>I know you haven't seen him for years,</i>

18:26.960 --> 18:30.157
<i>but I know how much you meant</i>
<i>to each other.</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:34.711
<i>He was so proud of you</i>
<i>and all that you've achieved.</i>

18:51.600 --> 18:54.114
- Can you get me a Bloody Mary?
- Certainly, sir.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.668
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The traffic was dreadful.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.036
Joe Scott, Hollywood's hottest
young director, Ritchie Smith.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.351
How are you doing? The script
is fantastic. Congratulations.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.113
Mannie says you've directed
some music videos.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.998
Did you look at 'em?
Fuckin' awesome, ain't they?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.355
- You didn't send them to me.
- We didn't?

19:11.440 --> 19:12.873
No.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.310
Excuse me. Hello?

19:17.400 --> 19:21.837
Yeah. What do you mean? I've been
trying to get hold of you for days.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.718
Yes, I have! Now is not a good time.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.197
Don't call me when
I'm in a fucking lunch meeting!

19:30.120 --> 19:32.190
I am serious! I'll talk to you later.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.068
- Can I get another one?
- Why didn't you call the office?

19:36.160 --> 19:40.517
That's the place to call, not when
I'm having lunch, OK? Call me later.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.238
Sure. Bye.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.152
Sorry about that. There'll be a tape
at your house when you get home, OK?

19:49.240 --> 19:51.356
OK, let's order some food!

19:55.800 --> 19:57.916
OK. This stuff looks good, huh?

19:59.120 --> 20:01.998
I had a big breakfast.
I'm just gonna have a salad.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.559
Yeah, so am I.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.992
Hello?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.276
Dave! How are you, my man?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.914
No, that's great.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.277
Sure, we'll talk later. OK, bye.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.876
Let's order! Excuse me?

20:34.160 --> 20:36.993
- I'm gonna have a green salad.
- Yeah, for me as well.

20:39.240 --> 20:42.118
- Ritchie, want anything?
- Burger.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.634
- Burger.
- How would you like that?

20:44.720 --> 20:47.598
- Rare?
- He'd like it rare.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.195
- Anything else I can get you?
- Ritchie, anything else?

20:51.280 --> 20:53.316
No. No, thank you.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.356
Thank you.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.269
Sorry.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.154
I have to go to the bathroom.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.719
Sure.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.515
OK.

21:13.560 --> 21:17.519
Business. Things have developed a lot
since we last spoke, OK?

21:17.600 --> 21:21.036
And since Ritchie started casting
seriously, he...

21:23.240 --> 21:25.435
Since Ritchie started casting seriously,

21:25.520 --> 21:28.432
he realises your character
isn't going the way he wants.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.671
You know how things are.
You start casting, things change,

21:31.760 --> 21:34.399
- dynamics change...
- Dynamics?

21:34.480 --> 21:38.439
Yeah. You know, dynamics.
Dynamics between characters.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.233
He wants to go younger.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.154
Hello?

21:45.960 --> 21:47.678
George!

21:49.800 --> 21:51.791
How are ya?

21:53.320 --> 21:55.754
That's great!
I tell you what you do, though.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.957
You take the $35 million,
you go to Brazil.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.919
You keep $34 million for yourself
and spend $1 million on a picture.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.039
Only don't spend it on this one. This...
What the fuck are you doing?

22:07.120 --> 22:10.510
- Are you trying to humiliate me?
- That's my fuckin' phone!

22:10.600 --> 22:12.909
Why didn't you say on the phone?
Why am I here?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.551
I... Goddamn it, when did you become
such an asshole? What date exactly?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.473
I thought Ritchie might give you
another part.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.393
- Have you read the script?
- Course I read the script.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.357
- Have you read the script?
- Yes.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.396
If you'd read the fuckin' script,

22:27.480 --> 22:31.155
you'd know there are only
four characters and three are women!

22:31.240 --> 22:35.233
So which other fucking part
do you think I might be right for?

22:35.320 --> 22:37.390
No other fuckin' part!

22:38.320 --> 22:42.359
I don't think there's any part
in any script for you, anywhere!

22:42.440 --> 22:44.476
No one's interested any more, Joe!

22:44.560 --> 22:48.838
And you know why not?
Because you're not interested any more!

22:48.920 --> 22:52.913
You have squandered every fuckin'
opportunity you've ever been given!

22:53.000 --> 22:56.356
Take a look in the mirror next time
you're snorting off it,

22:56.440 --> 22:58.396
because you are a mess!

22:58.480 --> 23:01.950
I am tired of pretending otherwise,
so I'm giving it to you straight.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.191
It is over. You are over.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.748
People are tired
of your pathetic behaviour.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.513
They don't wanna be around it
any more. Neither do I!

23:10.600 --> 23:14.434
So you know what I suggest? I suggest
you get yourself a new agent!

23:43.360 --> 23:44.998
Cool dog!

23:45.080 --> 23:46.718
- What?
- Brussels Griffon.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.791
- Brussels what?
- Brussels Griffon.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.111
- The Jack Nicholson dog.
- Yeah, the fucking dog. Thanks.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.280
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Where are you, Apple?

24:02.360 --> 24:04.316
<i>Hi, Joe!</i>

24:04.400 --> 24:07.472
Can you explain to me
why your dog is still in my car?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.676
- <i>I need a big favour.</i>
- No.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.719
- <i>Would look after him for a few days?</i>
- A few days? Are you insane?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.279
<i>I have to go away.</i>

24:15.360 --> 24:18.909
- You are not dumping your dog on me.
- <i>I'm not dumping him on you!</i>

24:19.000 --> 24:21.036
- <i>Just a few days.</i>
- What's that smell?

24:22.600 --> 24:26.229
Jesus!
Your dog has done a shit in my car!

24:26.320 --> 24:28.038
<i>Joe?</i>

24:28.120 --> 24:30.395
- No...
- <i>Joe?</i>

24:30.480 --> 24:32.391
- Don't hang up!
- <i>I'm losing you.</i>

24:32.480 --> 24:33.993
Don't hang up on me. Please!

24:34.080 --> 24:36.753
- <i>Can't hear you.</i>
- Don't hang up!

24:36.840 --> 24:38.876
Fuck! Fuck!

24:43.400 --> 24:46.119
You like the dog?
Keep the fucking dog.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.832
Hey, Joe?

29:13.160 --> 29:15.674
You know David Bowie
believes in aliens?

29:15.760 --> 29:17.318
Yeah, I know.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.234
You stink! You need a bath.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.117
I had a bath.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.519
When?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.079
I...

29:26.160 --> 29:29.948
Exactly. You never take a bath.
You stink.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.033
Well, how often do you have a bath then?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.311
- Every day.
- Every day?

29:37.400 --> 29:40.915
- Yes, every day.
- What, does your mum make you?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.560
No, I just like to be clean.

29:44.720 --> 29:47.996
Every day's not clean.
Every day's weird.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.039
- D'you remember that ginger girl?
- Shut up!

30:11.120 --> 30:12.439
Come on.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.868
Hang on, I can't even see!

30:21.960 --> 30:23.359
Joe!

30:24.440 --> 30:25.668
Joe!

30:25.760 --> 30:27.352
Wait here.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.475
Alright?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.551
Go round the side.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.913
- Wotcher.
- Wotcher.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.152
Hello. You're late.
You missed lunch.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.833
- Who are you?
- I'm Boots.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.638
What kind of name is that?

31:44.640 --> 31:48.315
I know you. You're the one who had
the epileptic fit at the cinema.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.835
- Is that a glass of selfish, Joe?
- What?

31:52.920 --> 31:55.115
- Boots, would you like a drink?
- Please.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.509
- Milk?
- Yeah, please.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.878
Joe, pour Boots a glass of milk
before you finish the bottle.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.599
What film was it
made you have the fit?

32:04.680 --> 32:06.796
<i>Ring of Bright Water?</i>

32:06.880 --> 32:09.440
- The one about the otter.
- Yeah.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.994
- Don't do that, Joe!
- What?

32:17.080 --> 32:19.230
Put the empty bottle back in the fridge.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.754
- Do you still have 'em?
- What?

32:21.840 --> 32:24.798
- Fits.
- I haven't for a long time.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.429
Well, you will. Once an epileptic,
always an epileptic.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.314
Come on.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.389
Kids grow up too quick these days.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.756
Good God, is that child trying
to scrape the paint off the walls?

32:38.840 --> 32:41.877
- What does "cunt" mean?
- I told you not to say that word!

32:41.960 --> 32:43.188
- You say it!
- I do not!

32:43.280 --> 32:45.316
Say it again and you'll get a hiding!

32:45.400 --> 32:47.675
- What the hell does it mean?
- Shut up!

32:47.760 --> 32:51.036
If I tell you, do you promise me
you won't say it again?

32:52.360 --> 32:54.555
It's a very bad word for your vagina.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.791
- What's my vagina?
- The proper word for your moo-moo.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.440
Go outside,
or I'll make you both into piccalilli!

33:01.880 --> 33:03.996
- You off already, Boots?
- Yeah.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.992
- How's your mum?
- She's alright.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.275
- Give her my love, won't you?
- Yeah.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.268
- Well, bye, then.
- Bye.

33:14.320 --> 33:18.438
I don't trust that boy.
Always looking out the sides of his eyes

33:18.520 --> 33:21.990
like some old dog
waiting to steal a bone.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.518
Boots!

33:30.480 --> 33:32.391
Is that woman still 'ere?

33:32.480 --> 33:35.233
- Who?
- Mrs Rogers?

33:40.520 --> 33:41.839
Bye.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.319
Oh, God...

33:44.520 --> 33:47.876
So they had to give me
one of them enemas.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.669
Well, I was blocked up
like an old crypt.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.320
And d'you know what they found?

33:54.400 --> 33:58.871
A plastic toy animal. Probably been
stuck in me bowels for over 20 years.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.918
- Oh, dear.
- I must have eaten it!

34:02.000 --> 34:05.754
But, you know, I can't taste a thing,
not since I hit my head.

34:13.679 --> 34:17.275
I always wonder what old people
looked like when they were young.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.476
It just makes me sad.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.552
Cos it's all gone,
and you think, "How cruel."

34:27.880 --> 34:30.518
I suppose if you
really concentrated...

34:31.600 --> 34:35.639
...you might be able to imagine
the old people you know as young.

34:35.719 --> 34:38.154
But it's really hard.

34:38.239 --> 34:42.438
Cos all I can see
is that they're old, ill, ugly...

34:43.440 --> 34:45.396
And their life's over.

34:55.239 --> 34:58.198
When you watch
an old person sleeping...

35:02.120 --> 35:04.554
...especially if they're very old...

35:08.400 --> 35:11.153
...you think,
"Will they ever wake up again?"

35:13.000 --> 35:15.389
Then they wake up very suddenly.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.392
One second,
they're sleeping and lifeless.

35:23.160 --> 35:27.199
Next second, they're turning on
the telly for the news.

35:27.280 --> 35:32.035
"Have I missed the news?
Have I missed the news?"

35:41.360 --> 35:44.238
When does a person stop keeping up?

35:59.040 --> 36:00.871
Why don't you make a move, Joe?

36:04.480 --> 36:06.152
What do you mean?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.797
Don't you fancy me?

36:20.560 --> 36:22.630
You can touch if you like.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.031
My mum's next door.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.716
She'll be busy.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.396
She won't be in.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.356
Are you gonna help me
with all them vegetables?

36:59.440 --> 37:01.396
Or do I have to chop 'em all meself?

37:01.480 --> 37:04.074
Yeah, I'm coming.
We were just talking.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.672
I better go back.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.477
See you later, Joe.

37:30.200 --> 37:34.671
I hate holidays as I much as I hate
sport, and that's saying something.

37:34.760 --> 37:39.356
I'm gonna have to go, Grace.
I might come by later.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.711
- Bye.
- Bye, then.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.669
I think this is ready for pouring.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.797
Evelyn should keep that child
locked up at home.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.234
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

38:32.720 --> 38:33.994
Stop!

38:34.080 --> 38:36.469
That was a good day's work.

38:36.560 --> 38:40.109
I enjoy the satisfaction
of doing small things well.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.150
Goodbye, Peggy Tickell!

38:44.240 --> 38:46.800
Goodbye, Peggy Tickell!

38:48.080 --> 38:50.355
Off already, Mrs Rogers?

38:51.320 --> 38:54.835
Yes. I don't like to overstay
my welcome.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.319
I know when I'm wanted. Make it
pretty bloody obvious, don't they?

39:00.400 --> 39:03.198
I've spent all day
doing their bloody cauliflower!

39:06.040 --> 39:07.189
Joe?

39:09.160 --> 39:10.354
Joe!

39:11.240 --> 39:12.753
What?

39:12.840 --> 39:14.751
I want you to do something for me.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.639
Can you take these over to Evelyn,
please?

39:19.720 --> 39:20.914
OK.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.991
Say thank you to her for me.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.833
Hi, Joe.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.354
I was about to get in the bath.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.830
- Mum asked me to bring these round.
- Come in.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.678
Go through.

40:01.120 --> 40:06.797
I was being a terrible tease earlier on.
You don't mind, do you?

40:06.880 --> 40:08.313
No.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.271
Did you like kissing me?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.918
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.230
Would you like to do it again?

40:25.600 --> 40:27.636
You look like you would.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.273
Yeah.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.391
Would you, Joe?

40:35.920 --> 40:39.117
Your mum'd kill me if she found out.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.997
She wouldn't find out.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.551
I suppose she wouldn't.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.159
You are very, very naughty.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.195
Hey, you two, what's going on?

41:26.280 --> 41:28.794
Quick, it's Jack!
Do your trousers up!

41:30.600 --> 41:34.070
Quickly! Come on! Come on, out.

41:34.160 --> 41:38.119
Out, come on! Get out!
Shit! He's back early!

41:39.880 --> 41:42.838
Come here, my beautiful girl!

41:42.920 --> 41:46.196
- What's happened?
- Jesse thumped Jane.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.917
Jesse, you can't go around
thumping people, you know.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.230
- She hit me first!
- I did not!

41:52.320 --> 41:53.799
Alright, that's enough.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.031
Joe, how are you?
Haven't seen you for a while.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.678
- OK, let me take her.
- No.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.751
She's fine now.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.956
Mum asked me to bring some piccalilli.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.598
Piccalilli! Lovely.

42:04.680 --> 42:08.275
- You gonna stop for a cuppa?
- No, I've got to take Jesse back.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.715
Say thanks to your mum
for the piccalilli.

42:11.640 --> 42:15.155
Shall we go and find you
some sweeties? Yeah?

42:19.680 --> 42:22.752
How long did God take
to make the world?

42:22.840 --> 42:25.991
Six days, and he rested on the seventh.

42:27.400 --> 42:31.188
He should've taken longer.
He would have done a better job.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.316
I could've done better.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.596
Come on, I'll race you.

42:41.520 --> 42:47.550
<i>85, 86, 87, 88, 89,</i>

42:47.640 --> 42:52.919
90, 91, 92, 93,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.276
94, 95, 96,

42:56.360 --> 43:00.512
97, 98, 99, 100,

43:00.600 --> 43:04.991
101, 102, 103, 104,

43:05.080 --> 43:06.991
105, 106...

43:07.960 --> 43:09.359
You bastard!

43:11.160 --> 43:14.630
106 seconds.
That's 50 pence you owe me, Hubble.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.630
I hope you die next time.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.112
How come you can do 106 seconds
and I can't even do 30?

43:21.200 --> 43:23.270
God-given talent I didn't ask for.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.595
It's Ruth Davies.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.118
Oi, Ruth!

43:33.200 --> 43:34.792
I really wanna fuck you!

43:34.880 --> 43:37.838
Well, if you do, Kevin Hubble,
and I ever find out...

43:40.280 --> 43:41.998
She wants me.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.594
- This is boring!
- What?

43:48.120 --> 43:49.189
Fuck!

43:53.840 --> 43:55.239
Wotcher, Ruth.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.119
Hi, Joe.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.590
Shit!

44:03.800 --> 44:04.994
You look tired.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.389
- Do I?
- Yeah.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.868
Well, I keep dreaming
that I can't sleep

44:10.960 --> 44:13.030
and I wake up exhausted.

44:14.960 --> 44:16.109
Fuck!

44:17.400 --> 44:19.516
See what you made me do?

44:21.120 --> 44:22.473
I'm gonna go.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.639
See ya.

44:30.280 --> 44:31.793
Do you wanna come?

44:33.080 --> 44:36.629
- What, me?
- Yeah.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.948
OK.

44:40.200 --> 44:43.749
Joe! I thought
we were going to the pictures.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.308
Slight change of plan.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.716
Jammy bastard!

44:58.640 --> 45:03.031
<i>Oh, the Jean Genie lives on his back</i>

45:03.120 --> 45:06.635
<i>The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks</i>

45:06.720 --> 45:10.235
<i>He's outrageous,</i>
<i>he screams and he bawls</i>

45:10.320 --> 45:14.518
<i>The Jean Genie, let yourself go</i>

45:16.520 --> 45:19.080
Who do you like more, Bowie or Roxy?

45:19.160 --> 45:22.072
I can't choose,
cos they're both brilliant.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.594
- You have to.
- It's impossible to choose.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.274
If you asked me Bowie
or Deep Purple

45:27.360 --> 45:30.113
or Roxy and Black Sabbath,
then I could choose.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.476
But not Bowie and Roxy.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.716
Thanks, but I don't smoke.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.195
Right.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.989
Here, try this on.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.675
So do you know
what this song is about?

46:04.680 --> 46:06.796
No.

46:07.800 --> 46:13.557
It's about Jean Genet.
He's a French writer.

46:13.640 --> 46:16.518
See, Jean Genie,
it's just a clever wordplay.

46:16.600 --> 46:20.229
"He says he's a beautician and sells
you nutrition." He sells drugs.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.959
"The Jean Genie lives on his back."
He's a poof.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.749
"The Jean Genie loves
chimney stacks." He loves cocaine.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.990
- What?
- He loves chimney stacks.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.640
- What goes up chimneys?
- Smoke.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.359
- And what makes smoke?
- Coal.

46:34.440 --> 46:38.228
Yeah. And coke.

46:38.320 --> 46:42.074
"He's walking on snow white."
It means he's walking on cocaine.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.991
How do you know
that's what he means?

46:44.080 --> 46:45.752
I read it in <i>NME.</i>

46:47.520 --> 46:51.479
Boots chucked his girlfriend because
she couldn't sit through a Bowie album.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.833
- He likes Bowie?
- He loves Bowie.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.990
Boots is a nose-picker.

46:59.080 --> 47:03.198
The kind who wipes his hand under
the seat if there isn't a tissue handy.

47:03.280 --> 47:07.592
- Or even if there is.
- How do you know that?

47:07.680 --> 47:09.910
I'm a good judge of character.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.390
I'm not saying I mind.
I'm just saying I know.

47:16.720 --> 47:19.154
Come on,
let's get another drink.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.948
Red or white?

47:33.040 --> 47:36.749
- White.
- Why are you whispering?

47:37.400 --> 47:40.437
Relax. There's no one here.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.235
- Can I have a look around?
- Sure.

48:19.440 --> 48:23.149
- What are you doing?
- This carpet is unbelievable.

48:23.240 --> 48:27.358
- How do you keep it so clean?
- No one's allowed in this room.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.629
- Sorry.
- I don't care.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.231
You can lay on it all you want.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.917
This feels good.

48:54.480 --> 48:58.189
I read that book by whatshisname.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.198
- William Burroughs
- Yeah. <i>Junkie.</i>

49:02.600 --> 49:04.431
Did you like it?

49:04.520 --> 49:06.431
No, not really.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.994
So it's back to <i>The Hobbit,</i> then.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.555
How fantastic is this song?

49:26.360 --> 49:30.558
How could you choose between
Bryan Ferry and David Bowie?

49:30.640 --> 49:32.232
They're gods.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.914
Come on.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.072
You do the backing vocals
on the next verse.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.878
- What?
- Come on.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.559
OK.

49:47.560 --> 49:49.073
This is what you do.

49:54.360 --> 49:57.193
Think Roxy girl.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.397
I'm gonna be Bryan.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.670
When will I see you again?

51:40.760 --> 51:44.036
<i>When will we share</i>
<i>precious moments?</i>

51:47.080 --> 51:50.789
- How about tomorrow?
- OK.

51:50.880 --> 51:53.917
- We could go to the pictures.
- OK.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.913
- I'll meet you at the arcade at seven.
- OK.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.278
Can I kiss you?

52:02.320 --> 52:03.594
OK.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.798
Tomorrow, then.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.638
Seven o'clock.

52:43.680 --> 52:47.593
We're not gonna catch anything
if those prats are splashing about.

52:51.640 --> 52:54.313
You never see kestrel any more.

52:54.400 --> 52:57.631
You used to be able to look up,
catch 'em on the wind.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.832
Now you'll be lucky.

53:03.760 --> 53:08.231
Hey, Joe, remember when we used
to go fishing with your dad?

53:08.320 --> 53:10.595
He snared hundreds of pikes, Joe's dad.

53:10.680 --> 53:14.832
Didn't even use a rod. He used,
like, this old leather bootlace.

53:14.920 --> 53:17.036
He'd see a pike
laying in the riverbed,

53:17.120 --> 53:20.157
and he'd take this old lace
and make it into a loop.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.231
He'd hang the loop from a pole

53:22.320 --> 53:25.710
and gradually, gradually just
lower it down in front of him.

53:25.800 --> 53:29.031
He'd go into the slipknot
and onto the bank. Caught hundreds.

53:29.120 --> 53:32.476
- Can you give me a hand?
- <i>(Kevin)</i> Oi, Joe!

53:32.560 --> 53:36.599
"Well, if you do, Kevin Hubble,
and I ever find out!"

53:36.680 --> 53:40.514
"Don't hurt me, Joe. Please don't
hurt me! I've never done it before."

53:40.600 --> 53:43.831
- "I'm a virgin."
- You're such a moron, Hubble.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.751
Wanker!

53:45.840 --> 53:48.638
- You know Erich Conrad's a poof?
- No, he's not.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.518
He is. He told his brother
and his brother told me.

53:51.600 --> 53:55.309
He realised he was a poof when
he was watching wrestling on the telly

53:55.400 --> 53:56.958
and he got an erection.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.031
Erich Conrad's a poof.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.237
I knew that. He got a hard-on
while watching the wrestling.

54:02.320 --> 54:05.312
You know Billie Jean King?
She's a lesbian.

54:05.400 --> 54:07.470
Joe's Aunt Peggy's a lezzer.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.675
No, she's not!

54:08.760 --> 54:11.149
Why does she look like a bloke, then?

54:11.240 --> 54:12.958
You're a fucking retard, Hubble!

54:13.040 --> 54:14.553
He's trying to fuck me!

54:15.640 --> 54:18.837
- He's trying to fuck me!
- Come back here.

54:18.920 --> 54:22.310
My granddad just visited
a German concentration camp.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.391
Said it was the most horrible place.

54:24.480 --> 54:28.598
Everyone on the tour was crying.
Everything there is kept original.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.638
He said Germans eat twice as much
as we do in England.

54:31.720 --> 54:35.793
And the men, they walk around with
great big arses on 'em like women.

54:35.880 --> 54:39.589
Old people loved the war. They
always cheer up when it's mentioned.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.194
My grandma doesn't like foreigners.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.880
She thinks of Indians and Africans
as animals.

54:44.960 --> 54:48.350
She saw a man in a turban
and said, "If they live in this country,

54:48.440 --> 54:51.034
they should be forced
to wear civilised clothes."

54:51.120 --> 54:54.192
Well, she's right, ain't she?
Fucking niggers and Pakis!

54:54.280 --> 54:58.239
- Coming over here, taking our jobs.
- Shut up, Hubble, you prat.

54:59.360 --> 55:03.319
It's boring here.
I'm off to the arcade. Coming, Hubble?

55:03.400 --> 55:07.234
No. I think I'm gonna catch some sun
and watch these losers catch a cold.

55:07.320 --> 55:10.198
- Alright. See you later, mate.
- See you later, mate.

55:11.305 --> 55:17.289
