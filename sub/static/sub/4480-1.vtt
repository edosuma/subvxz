00:28.880 --> 00:34.079
# When I was just a little girl

00:34.160 --> 00:39.314
# I asked my mother, what will I be?

00:40.400 --> 00:42.994
# Will I be pretty?

00:43.080 --> 00:45.514
# Will I be rich?

00:45.600 --> 00:49.912
# Here's what she said to me

00:50.000 --> 00:54.118
# Que será, será

00:54.200 --> 00:59.672
# Whatever will be, will be

00:59.760 --> 01:05.072
# The future's not ours to see

01:05.160 --> 01:08.038
# Que será, será

01:08.920 --> 01:13.755
# What will be, will be

01:15.120 --> 01:20.069
# When I was just a child in school

01:20.160 --> 01:26.235
# I asked my teacher, what should I try?

01:26.320 --> 01:29.118
# Should I paint pictures?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.794
# Should I sing songs?

01:31.880 --> 01:35.839
# This was her wise reply

01:35.920 --> 01:40.152
# Que será, será

01:40.240 --> 01:45.189
# Whatever will be, will be

01:45.280 --> 01:50.195
# The future's not ours to see

01:50.280 --> 01:54.432
# Que será, será

01:55.440 --> 02:01.356
# What will be, will be... #

02:05.640 --> 02:07.631
Damn.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.675
It's your turn, Heather.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.312
No, Heather. It's Heather's turn.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.356
Heather.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.352
Sorry, Heather.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.116
# Que será, será

02:26.200 --> 02:31.558
# Whatever will be, will be

02:31.640 --> 02:36.270
# The future's not ours to see

02:36.360 --> 02:41.195
# Que será, será

02:41.280 --> 02:46.274
# What will be, will be

02:46.360 --> 02:53.710
# Que será, será #

03:05.000 --> 03:06.831
Dear diary...

03:06.920 --> 03:10.708
'Heather told me
she teaches people real life.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.270
'She said real life sucks losers dry.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.070
'If you want to fuck with the eagles,
you have to learn to fly.

03:19.160 --> 03:23.358
'I said, "So, you teach people
to spread their wings and fly?"

03:23.440 --> 03:25.351
'She said, "Yes."

03:25.440 --> 03:27.874
'I said, "You're beautiful..."'

03:27.960 --> 03:30.474
God, come on, Veronica.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.551
What is your damage, Heather?

03:32.640 --> 03:34.437
Don't blame me, blame Heather.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.273
She told me to haul your ass
into the caff pronto.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.588
Back me up, Heather.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.638
She really wants to talk to you, Veronica.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.917
OK, I'm going. Jesus Christ.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.271
Hello, Heather.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.351
Veronica. Finally.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.113
I got a note of Kurt Kelly's.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.113
I need you to forge a hot and horny
but realistic note in Kurt's handwriting.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.873
We'll slip it onto
Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.952
I don't have anything
against Martha Dunnstock.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.110
You don't have anything for her.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.350
Come on. It'll be very.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.752
The note will give her shower nozzle
masturbation material for weeks.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.520
I'll think about it.

04:25.610 --> 04:27.566
Don't think.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.757
Veronica needs something to write on.
Bend over.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.672
Dear Martha, you're so sweet...

04:45.760 --> 04:48.433
I'm telling you, man, it'd so be righteous

04:48.520 --> 04:51.956
to be in a Veronica Sawyer -
Heather Chandler sandwich.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.871
Hell, yes.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.112
I want to put a Heather on my johnson
and spin her around like a pinwheel.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.679
Punch it in.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.078
Westerburg feeds the world.
Come on, people.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.755
Give that leftover lunch money
to people who don't have lunches.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.400
God, aren't they fed yet?

05:37.480 --> 05:40.313
Do they even have thanksgiving in Africa?

05:40.400 --> 05:43.915
Oh, sure. Pilgrims, Indians, Tater Tots.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.911
It's a real party continent.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.230
Sawyer, guess what today is.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.118
Ouch. Lunch-time poll?
What's the question?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.634
Yeah, what's the question, Heather?

05:53.720 --> 05:57.599
God, you were with me in study hall
when I thought of it.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.194
I forgot.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.840
Such a pillowcase.

06:04.040 --> 06:08.556
It's not that bizarro thing you were babbling
about over the phone last night, is it?

06:08.640 --> 06:10.278
Of course it is.

06:11.680 --> 06:16.879
I told Dennis if he gives me another
political topic, I'd spew burrito chunks.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.192
Oh, Veronica, I'm sorry.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.998
Betty Finn. Gosh.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.595
I'm sorry I couldn't go
to your birthday party last month.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.592
It's OK. Your mom said you had a big date.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.638
I'd probably miss my own birthday for a date.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.676
Don't say that.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.834
I was looking around the other day
and I dug up these old photographs.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.316
Oh. They're great.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.436
Come on, Veronica.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.636
I was talking to somebody.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.510
Great. Here comes Heather.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.830
Oh, shit.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.151
- Hi, Courtney. Love your cardigan.
- Thanks.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.196
I got it last night at The Limited.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.795
Like, totally blew my allowance.

07:12.880 --> 07:17.317
Check this out. You win $5 million
from the Publisher Sweepstakes

07:17.400 --> 07:20.039
and the same day
the guy gives you the cheque,

07:20.120 --> 07:26.070
aliens land on the earth and say they'll blow
up the world in two days. What do you do?

07:26.160 --> 07:27.752
That's easy.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.389
I'd just slide that wad over to my father

07:31.480 --> 07:34.438
because he's one of the state's top brokers.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.308
If I got that money,
I'd give it all to the homeless.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.038
Every cent.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.076
You're beautiful.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.994
If you're going to openly be a bitch...

07:48.080 --> 07:51.072
Why can't we talk to
kinds of different people?

07:51.160 --> 07:54.948
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw.
Do I look like Mother Teresa?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.669
If I did, I probably wouldn't mind
talking to the geek squad.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.914
Did see that? Heather number one
just looked right at me.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.913
Does it not bother you that
everybody thinks you're a piranha?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.956
Like I give a shit.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.873
They all want me as a friend or a fuck.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.236
I'm worshiped at Westerburg
and I'm only a junior.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.755
I can't believe this, we're going to a party
at Remington University tonight

08:32.840 --> 08:37.960
and we're brushing up on our conversational
skills with the scum of the school.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.188
Hi.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.399
Hi.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.597
So this is what's called a lunch-time poll.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.717
You win $5 million
in the Publisher Sweepstakes

08:49.800 --> 08:52.598
and the same day whatshisface
gives you the cheque

08:52.680 --> 08:54.477
aliens land on earth

08:54.560 --> 08:56.312
and say they'll blow up the world
in two days.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.960
What are you going to do with the money?

08:59.040 --> 09:00.598
I'd go to Egypt.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.238
With a girl.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.756
I'd use the money for
an end-of-the-world get-together.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.559
I'd pay Madonna a million bucks
to sit on my face

09:08.640 --> 09:10.596
and ride like the Kentucky Derby.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.831
That's the most spooky-assed question
I ever heard.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.718
After taxes, I'll only be getting...

09:16.800 --> 09:18.597
She should pay me, though.

09:18.680 --> 09:23.435
You go to the zoo and get a lion and
put a remote control bomb up its butt...

09:23.520 --> 09:26.193
Then there's social security, legal fees...

09:26.280 --> 09:30.319
Push the button on the bomb
and you and the lion die like one.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.590
What?

09:38.160 --> 09:41.277
Oh, my God. Here we go.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.392
Oh, my God.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.436
Hi, Veronica.
Five keeps an infant alive.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.830
You wanted to be a member of
the most powerful clique in school.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.515
If I wasn't already the head of it,
I'd want the same thing.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.716
Come on, Veronica.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.995
You used to have a sense of humour.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.629
Veronica, could you
come back here a minute?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.995
A true friend's work is never done.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.389
- Gross.
- Gross.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.916
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia is so '87.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.595
- Maybe you should see a doctor.
- Yeah, maybe.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.753
Come on, Heather,
let's take another look at today's lunch.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.393
God, Veronica, drool much?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.550
His name's Jason Dean.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.596
He's in my American History.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.956
Hello, Jason Dean.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.157
Greetings and salutations.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.356
Are you a Heather?

11:42.440 --> 11:43.509
No.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.956
I'm a Veronica. Sawyer.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.352
This may seem like
a really stupid question...

11:51.440 --> 11:53.635
There are no stupid questions.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.639
You inherit $5 million.
The same day aliens land on the earth

11:59.720 --> 12:03.554
and say they're going to blow it up
in two days. What do you do?

12:06.320 --> 12:09.232
That's the stupidest question
I've ever heard.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.790
Who's that guy in the coat
think he is anyways?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.552
Bo Diddley?

12:14.640 --> 12:17.074
Veronica's into his act, no doubt.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.197
I don't know. Probably row out
to the middle of a lake,

12:20.280 --> 12:22.748
bring along a bottle of tequila,

12:22.840 --> 12:25.912
my sax and some Bach.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.993
How very.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.436
Come on, Veronica.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.194
Later.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.236
Definitely.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.431
Let's kick his ass.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.556
Shit, Ram, we're seniors, man.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.074
We're too old for kind of that kind of crap.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.515
Let's give him a good scare, though.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.232
You going to eat this?

12:59.320 --> 13:03.552
What did your boyfriend say when you told
him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.790
Answer him, dick.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.237
Hey, Ram, doesn't this cafeteria
have a "no fags allowed" rule?

13:10.320 --> 13:14.996
They seem to have an open-door policy
for assholes, though, don't they?

13:17.720 --> 13:19.631
What did you say, dickhead?

13:19.720 --> 13:22.188
I'll repeat myself.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.792
They won't expel him, they'll just
suspend him for a week or something.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.953
He used a real gun.
They should throw his ass in jail.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.600
No way. He used blanks.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.195
All JD really did was ruin two pairs of pants.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.236
Maybe not even that.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.595
Can you bleach out urine stains?

13:45.680 --> 13:50.800
You seem pretty amused. I thought
you had given up on high school guys.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.871
Never say never.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.390
What are you going to do, Heather?

13:57.480 --> 14:00.756
Take the two shots or send me out?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.715
Did you have a brain tumour for breakfast?

14:04.800 --> 14:07.519
First you ask if you can be red,

14:07.600 --> 14:09.716
knowing that I'm always red.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.548
Shit.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.031
It's your turn, Heather.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.516
Easy shot, Heather.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.716
No way, no day.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.473
Give it up, girl.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.675
- Holy shit.
- Incredible!

14:41.760 --> 14:43.637
Whoo!

14:44.880 --> 14:48.111
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?

14:48.200 --> 14:50.395
I'm giving Veronica her shot,

14:50.480 --> 14:52.789
her first Remington party.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.950
You blow it tonight, girl,

14:55.040 --> 14:57.600
and it's keggers with kids all next year.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.559
Why?

15:11.640 --> 15:12.629
Why not?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.032
Heather, your mother's here.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.350
Come on, whoever wants a ride.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.873
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye-bye, girls.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.793
Hey, take a break, Veronica. Sit down.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.516
So what was the first week
of spring vacation withdrawal like?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.556
I don't know. It was OK, I guess.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.518
Hey, kid, isn't the prom coming up?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.238
I guess.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.390
Any contestants worth mentioning?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.038
Maybe.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.396
There's kind of
a dark horse in the running.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.876
God, will somebody tell me
why I read these spy novels?

15:52.960 --> 15:55.269
Because you're an idiot.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.715
Oh, yeah, that's it.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.109
You two...

16:00.200 --> 16:05.035
Great pâté, but I gotta motor
if I want to be ready for that party tonight.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.072
Corn nuts!

16:10.160 --> 16:11.479
BQ or plain?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.312
BQ!

16:16.920 --> 16:20.117
You're going to pull a super-chug with that?

16:21.200 --> 16:25.398
No, but if you're nice,
I'll let you buy me a slushie.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.393
I see you know
your convenience-speak pretty well.

16:29.480 --> 16:33.473
Yeah, well, I've been
moved around all my life.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.394
Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas...

16:37.480 --> 16:39.596
Sherwood, Ohio.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.558
There's always been
a Snappy Snack Shack.

16:42.640 --> 16:48.112
Any town, any time, pop a ham and cheese
in the microwave and feast on a turbo-dog.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.991
Keeps me sane.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.752
Really?

16:55.640 --> 16:59.952
That thing you pulled in the caff today
was pretty severe.

17:00.040 --> 17:04.238
Yeah, well, the extreme
always seems to make an impression.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.270
Did you say a cherry or Coke slushie?

17:10.359 --> 17:13.670
I didn't. Cherry.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.238
Great bike.

17:22.319 --> 17:26.996
Yeah. Just a humble perk
from my dad's construction company.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.832
Seen the commercial, right?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.957
"Bringing every state to a higher state."

17:32.040 --> 17:33.996
Wait a minute. Jason Dean.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.640
Your pop's Big Bud Dean Construction?

17:36.720 --> 17:39.837
It must be rough moving place to place.

17:39.920 --> 17:43.799
Everybody's life has got static.
Is your life perfect?

17:43.880 --> 17:46.872
Yeah. I'm going to
a Remington University party.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.357
No, my life's not perfect.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.476
I don't really like my friends.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.348
Yeah, uh, I don't really like
your friends, either.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.756
Well, it's just like they're people I work with

18:04.840 --> 18:07.912
and our job is being popular and shit.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.913
Maybe it's time to take a vacation.

18:21.520 --> 18:25.115
Hello, ladies.
Throw your coats on the floor.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.111
Veronica, this is Brad.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.599
Excellent.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.877
Did you girls bring
your partying slippers?

18:31.960 --> 18:34.872
- Let's party.
- She loves to party.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.359
'Dear diary, I want to kill,

18:43.440 --> 18:46.637
'and it's for more than just selfish reasons.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.473
'More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.391
'You have to believe me.'

18:51.480 --> 18:55.837
It's so great to talk to a girl
and not have to ask "what's your major?"

18:55.920 --> 18:57.876
I hate that.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.389
So, when you go to college,

19:06.480 --> 19:09.153
what subjects do you think you'll study?

19:11.920 --> 19:15.037
Come on, David.
Shouldn't we get back to the party?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.758
We will.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.718
It's just you're so hot tonight.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.756
I can't control myself.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.676
'I can't explain it but
I'm allowed an understanding

19:35.760 --> 19:40.356
'that my parents and these
Remington assholes have chosen to ignore.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.908
'I understand that I must stop Heather.'

20:17.560 --> 20:19.835
How's my little cheerleader, huh?

20:21.560 --> 20:26.680
Oh, I know everyone
at your high school isn't so uptight.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.718
- Come on.
- I don't feel so good, OK?

20:29.800 --> 20:32.712
Let's do it on the coats.
It'll be excellent, huh?

20:32.800 --> 20:35.189
I have a prepared speech I tell my suitor

20:35.280 --> 20:37.999
when he wants more
than I'd like to give him.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.957
Gee, blank, I had a really nice...

20:40.040 --> 20:42.508
Save the speeches for Malcolm X.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.836
I just want to get laid.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.074
You don't deserve my fucking speech.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.159
'Betty Finn was a true friend
and I sold her out

20:55.240 --> 20:58.073
'for a bunch of Swatchdogs
and Diet Cokeheads.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.835
'Killing Heather would be like offing
the Wicked Witch of the West.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.117
'Wait, East. West!
I sound like a fucking psycho.'

21:16.280 --> 21:19.795
What's your damage?
Brad says you're being a cooze.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.759
I feel really sick, like I'm gonna throw up.
Can we please jam now?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.592
No. Hell, no.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.156
'Tomorrow I'll be kissing
her aerobicised ass

21:40.240 --> 21:43.869
'but tonight let me dream of
a world without Heather,

21:43.960 --> 21:46.076
'a world where I am free.'

21:53.000 --> 21:55.070
You stupid fuck.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.549
You goddamn bitch.

21:57.640 --> 22:02.270
You were nothing before you met me.
You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.830
You were a Bluebird, you were a Brownie,

22:05.920 --> 22:08.559
you were a Girl Scout Cookie.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.279
I got you into a Remington party.

22:11.360 --> 22:15.069
What's my thanks?
It's on the hallway carpet.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.957
I got paid in puke.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.350
Lick it up, baby. Lick it up.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.030
Monday morning you're history.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.350
I'll tell everyone about tonight.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.716
Transfer to Washington,
transfer to Jefferson,

22:29.800 --> 22:34.316
no one at Westerburg's gonna let you
play their reindeer games.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.952
Dreadful etiquette. I apologise.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.552
That's OK.

22:50.840 --> 22:54.879
I saw the croquet set up in the back.
You up for a match?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.109
I thank you.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.557
That was my first game of strip croquet.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.631
You're welcome.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.429
It's a lot more interesting
than just flinging off your clothes

23:17.520 --> 23:20.080
and boning away
on a neighbour's swing set.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.628
There's lots to be said for throwing off...

23:26.840 --> 23:28.876
What a night.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.791
What a life.

23:30.880 --> 23:34.395
They wanted to move me
into high school out of the sixth grade

23:34.480 --> 23:37.313
because I was supposed to be
this big genius.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.391
Then we decided to chuck the idea

23:39.480 --> 23:43.268
because I'd have trouble
making friends, blah, blah, blah.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.396
Now blah, blah, blah is all I do.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.472
I use my grand IQ
to decide what colour gloss to wear

23:48.560 --> 23:51.438
and how to hit three keggers before curfew.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.559
Heather Chandler is one bitch
that deserves to die.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.915
Killing her won't solve anything.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.711
I say we just grow up, be adults and die.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.431
But before that...

24:16.520 --> 24:19.876
I'd love to see Heather Chandler
puke her guts out.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.474
Trust me, she skips
the Saturday morning trip to grandma's

24:28.560 --> 24:30.516
even when she's not hung over.

24:31.840 --> 24:35.276
We'll just concoct ourselves
a little hangover cure

24:35.360 --> 24:38.989
that'll induce her to spew
red, white and blue, then.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.838
What about milk and orange juice?
What's the up-chuck factor on that?

24:44.920 --> 24:48.310
I'm a no-rust-build-up man, myself.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.356
Don't be a dick.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.317
That stuff will kill her.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.236
I know, we can cook up some soup
and put it in a Coke.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.071
That's pretty sick, eh?

25:06.160 --> 25:09.470
Should it be chicken noodle
or bean with bacon?

25:10.560 --> 25:14.075
Put a lid on that stuff.
I say we go with big blue here.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.878
What are you talking about?

25:15.960 --> 25:20.875
She would never drink anything
that looked like that, anyway.

25:20.960 --> 25:24.157
So we'll... put it in this.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.879
She won't be able to see
what she's drinking.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.916
Let me get a cup, jerk.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.837
OK.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.798
Milk and orange juice.

25:38.880 --> 25:43.317
Maybe we could, like, cough up
a phlegm globber in it or something.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.315
- No?
- Nothing.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.359
Oh, well. Milk and orange juice
will do quite nicely.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.590
You're chicken.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.636
You're not funny.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.752
I'm sorry.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.879
- Uh, Veronica?
- What?

26:31.960 --> 26:36.033
Uh, never mind. I'll, er, carry the cup.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.550
Morning, Heather.

26:44.360 --> 26:48.239
Veronica... and Jesse James.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.675
Quelle surprise.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.957
Hear about Veronica's
affection for regurgitation?

26:54.040 --> 26:57.237
Last night we both
said things we didn't mean.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.038
Did we?

26:59.120 --> 27:00.951
How did you get in?

27:01.040 --> 27:04.999
Um... Veronica knew
you'd have a hangover

27:05.080 --> 27:07.548
so, uh, I whipped this up for you.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.392
It's a family recipe.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.710
What, you put a phlegm globber in it?

27:11.800 --> 27:14.758
I'm not going to drink that piss.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.400
I knew this stuff'd be too intense for her.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.429
Intense.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.238
Grow up.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.518
You think I'll drink it
just because you call me chicken?

27:30.720 --> 27:32.631
Just give me the cup, jerk.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.516
Corn nuts.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.396
Oh, my God.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.914
I can't believe it.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.956
I just killed my best friend.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.917
And your worst enemy.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.956
Same difference.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.551
Ohh...

28:28.640 --> 28:30.835
What are we going to tell the cops?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.960
"Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

28:36.040 --> 28:38.508
Cops.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.592
I can't believe this is my life.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.274
Oh, my God.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.874
I'm going to have to send
my SAT scores

28:46.960 --> 28:49.349
to San Quentin instead of Stanford.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.679
All right, just a little freaked, here.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.799
At least you got what you wanted.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.757
Got what I wanted?

29:00.840 --> 29:03.752
It's one thing to want
somebody out of your life,

29:03.840 --> 29:08.118
it's another thing to serve them
a wake-up cup full of liquid drainer.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.869
All right, we did a murder
and that's a crime,

29:35.960 --> 29:41.751
but if this were like
a suicide thing, you know?

29:44.480 --> 29:46.198
Like a suicide thing?

29:46.280 --> 29:48.555
Yeah, yeah.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.553
You can do Heather's handwriting
as well as your own, right?

29:54.640 --> 29:56.312
Right?

30:02.640 --> 30:05.074
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.873
You might think what I've done is shocking?

30:09.960 --> 30:11.154
Yeah.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.880
Um...

30:16.960 --> 30:20.032
to me, though,
suicide is the natural answer

30:20.120 --> 30:23.669
to the myriad of problems
life has given me.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.991
That's good but Heather
would never use the word myriad.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.389
This is the last thing she'll ever write,

30:29.480 --> 30:32.392
she'll want to use
as many 50-cent words as possible.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.438
She missed myriad
on the vocab test two weeks ago.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.556
That only proves my point more.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.712
The word is a badge
for her failures at school.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.837
Oh. OK, you're probably right.

30:46.440 --> 30:52.595
People think just because
you're beautiful and popular,

30:52.680 --> 30:56.070
life is easy and fun.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.390
- Yeah.
- Uh...

30:58.480 --> 31:04.237
no one understood I had feelings too.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.152
I die knowing no one knew the real me.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.030
That's good.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.076
Have you done this before?

31:20.320 --> 31:23.357
Any other principal
would take the same position -

31:23.440 --> 31:25.476
keep things business as usual.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.120
Heather Chandler's
not your everyday suicide.

31:28.200 --> 31:31.715
- She was very popular.
- If I let these kids out before lunch,

31:31.800 --> 31:34.837
the switchboard would light up
like a Christmas tree.

31:34.920 --> 31:40.597
I was impressed that she made proper use
of the word myriad in her suicide note.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.911
I find it profoundly disturbing

31:44.000 --> 31:47.356
that we're told of
the tragic destruction of youth

31:47.440 --> 31:50.318
and all we can think to talk about

31:50.400 --> 31:53.790
is adequate mourning times
and misused vocabulary words.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.677
Oh, Christ!

31:55.760 --> 31:58.911
We must revel in this revealing moment.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.709
Look, I suggest that
we get everybody together,

32:02.800 --> 32:05.792
both students and teachers, in the cafeteria

32:05.880 --> 32:09.839
and just talk and feel...

32:09.920 --> 32:11.592
together.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.990
Thank you, Ms Fleming.
You call me when the shuttle lands.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.548
Now, is this Heather the cheerleader?

32:17.640 --> 32:20.279
That would be Heather McNamara.

32:20.360 --> 32:24.353
Damn. I'd be willing to go half a day
for a cheerleader.

32:24.440 --> 32:28.752
God, it's unfair. It's just so unfair.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.912
We should get off a whole week,
not just an hour.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.718
Write the school board.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.519
Watch it, you might be digesting food.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.478
- Yeah, where is your urge to purge?
- Fuck it.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.312
Look...

32:43.800 --> 32:47.031
Heather left behind one of her Swatches.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.680
She'd want you to have it, Veronica.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.470
She always said
you couldn't accessorise for shit.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.630
Sorry to hear about your friend.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.439
I thought she was your usual airhead bitch.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.431
Guess I was wrong.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.476
We all were.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.717
What a waste.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.836
Oh, the humanity.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.632
Veronica?

33:28.720 --> 33:31.439
Veronica, what are you doing?

33:42.920 --> 33:48.870
I'm just so thrilled...
to finally have an example

33:48.960 --> 33:52.873
of the profound sensitivity of
which a human animal is capable.

33:52.960 --> 33:56.555
That example is Heather Chandler.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.312
I have her note.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.550
Whoo!

34:00.640 --> 34:03.438
I'm gonna pass this note around the class

34:03.520 --> 34:06.910
so you can all feel
its pathetic beauty for yourself.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.996
And while we do this,

34:10.080 --> 34:13.516
I think it's a good opportunity to share...

34:13.600 --> 34:17.434
the feelings that this suicide
has spurred in all of us.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.239
Now, who would like to begin?

34:20.320 --> 34:22.275
I heard it was really gnarly.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.114
She sucked down a bowl of
multi-purpose deodorising disinfectant

34:26.199 --> 34:27.838
and then smash!

34:27.920 --> 34:32.596
Tracy, let's not rehash the coroner's report,
let's talk emotions.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.114
Um, Heather and I used to go out

34:36.199 --> 34:38.270
but she said I was boring.

34:38.360 --> 34:41.237
But now I realise I really wasn't boring...

34:41.320 --> 34:44.039
it's just that she was
dissatisfied with her life.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.995
That's... very good, Peter.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.390
Are we going to be tested on this?

34:59.480 --> 35:01.436
'We were the same size

35:01.520 --> 35:05.559
'so we could borrow
each other's clothes, mix it up. It was fun.'

35:05.640 --> 35:09.997
"I remember I won her
a rhino at the 4-H Club... '

35:10.080 --> 35:12.469
You're an asshole. Mute him.

35:13.480 --> 35:18.110
- 'We liked the same clothes... '
- How many networks did you run to?

35:18.200 --> 35:20.430
'It won't be the same without her.'

35:20.520 --> 35:23.717
What are you talking about?
You hated her. She hated you.

35:23.800 --> 35:27.110
'Every English class
I looked forward to seeing her... '

35:27.200 --> 35:30.431
Heather Chandler
is more popular than ever now.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.598
- Scary stuff.
- Yeah.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.795
Hey, son, I didn't hear you come in.

35:38.880 --> 35:42.509
Hey, Dad, how was work today?

35:46.640 --> 35:50.713
It was miserable.
Some damn tribe of withered old bitches

35:50.800 --> 35:53.997
doesn't want us to terminate
that fleabag hotel.

35:54.080 --> 35:58.471
All because Glen Miller and his band
once took a shit there.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.757
Just like Kansas.
You remember fucking Kansas?

36:01.840 --> 36:04.274
That was the one with the wheat, right?

36:04.360 --> 36:08.148
Yeah. Save the Memorial Oak Tree Society.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.629
Showed those fucks.

36:10.720 --> 36:14.759
30 of those 4th of July fireworks
attached to the trunk.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.796
Arraigned but acquitted.

36:16.880 --> 36:21.476
Gosh, Pop,
I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.471
Oh. Veronica, this is my dad.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.516
Dad, Veronica.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.749
Hi.

36:28.440 --> 36:32.433
Son, why don't you ask
your little friend to stay for dinner?

36:32.520 --> 36:36.115
I can't. My mom's making
my favourite meal tonight -

36:36.200 --> 36:38.555
spaghetti, lots of oregano.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.278
How nice.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.271
The last time I saw my mom

36:42.360 --> 36:46.433
she was waving from
a library window in Texas. Right, Dad?

36:48.160 --> 36:49.912
Right...

36:50.000 --> 36:51.353
son.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.876
Right.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.360
Take a break, Veronica. Sit down.

37:03.160 --> 37:06.869
So what was the first day
after Heather's suicide like?

37:06.960 --> 37:08.996
Well, it was OK, I guess.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.991
Terrible thing.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.993
So, will we get to meet
this dark horse prom contender?

37:16.080 --> 37:18.548
Maybe.

37:18.640 --> 37:22.269
God, will somebody tell me
why I smoke these things?

37:22.360 --> 37:24.590
Because you're an idiot.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.596
Oh, yeah. That's it.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.750
You two...

37:29.840 --> 37:33.833
Great pâté but I have to motor
if want to be ready for that funeral.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.157
I blame not Heather

37:41.240 --> 37:44.630
but rather a society

37:44.720 --> 37:46.870
that tells its youth

37:46.960 --> 37:52.034
that the answers can be found
in the MTV video games.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.676
We must pray that the other
teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio,

37:57.760 --> 38:01.275
know the name of that righteous dude

38:01.360 --> 38:04.318
who can solve their problems.

38:04.400 --> 38:08.473
It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.956
Amen.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.956
'O God, this is a tragic thing

38:19.040 --> 38:22.316
'and sometimes
I have a hard time dealing with it.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.595
'Please send Heather to heaven.'

38:24.680 --> 38:27.433
'Dear God, please make sure
this never happens to me,

38:27.520 --> 38:29.476
'I don't think I can handle suicide.

38:29.560 --> 38:34.315
'Early acceptance into an Ivy League school
and please let it be Harvard. Amen.'

38:34.400 --> 38:39.269
'Jesus God in heaven,
why did you kill such hot snatch?

38:39.360 --> 38:43.194
'It's a joke, man.
Jeez, people are so serious.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.271
'Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven,

38:45.360 --> 38:48.318
'pray for all us sinners
so we don't get caught.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.356
'Another joke, man.'

38:50.440 --> 38:54.194
'I prayed for the death of
Heather Chandler many times.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.795
'I felt bad every time I did it
but I kept doing it.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.519
'Now I know you understood everything.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.398
'Praise Jesus. Hallelujah.'

39:04.680 --> 39:06.636
'Hi. I'm sorry.

39:06.720 --> 39:12.477
'Technically, I did not kill Heather Chandler,
but, hey, who am I trying to kid, right?

39:12.560 --> 39:15.996
'I just want my high school
to be a nice place.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.752
'Amen.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.796
'Did that sound bitchy? '

39:24.480 --> 39:27.756
Veronica, what are you doing tonight?

39:29.000 --> 39:33.232
I don't know. Mourning.
Maybe watch some TV. Why?

39:34.880 --> 39:37.997
Well, Ram asked me out tonight...

39:38.080 --> 39:41.197
but he wants to double with Kurt...

39:41.280 --> 39:43.714
and Kurt doesn't have a date.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.360
Heather, I have something going with JD.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.750
Please, Veronica.
Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.910
I'll be your best friend.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.879
So we on tonight, man, or what?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.916
I don't know.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.355
I still got to talk to Heather, dude.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.351
Weird funeral, huh?

40:05.480 --> 40:08.074
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.118
- Let's kick his ass.
- Cool off.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.668
- We're seniors.
- Goddamn geek!

40:14.840 --> 40:18.594
Ah, well. Sit and spin.

40:18.680 --> 40:21.069
That little prick.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.229
You piece of shit fag.
You like to suck big dicks?

40:35.320 --> 40:38.392
- Cut it out.
- Say, "I like to suck big dicks."

40:38.480 --> 40:41.472
Leave him alone, Ram.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.758
Say it.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.953
Say it!

40:50.040 --> 40:51.678
OK, OK.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.956
You like to suck big dicks.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.076
I like to suck big dicks.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.032
I can't get enough of 'em.
Are you satisfied?

41:08.120 --> 41:10.998
Don't worry. Ram's been so sweet lately,

41:11.080 --> 41:13.071
consoling me and stuff.

41:13.160 --> 41:16.232
It'll be really very. Promise.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.517
OK. Just as long as
it won't be one of those nights

41:19.600 --> 41:23.718
where they get shitfaced
and take us to a pasture to tip cows.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.313
- Is it sleeping, dude?
- I think so, man.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.436
Shh!

41:35.960 --> 41:37.518
Come here.

41:37.600 --> 41:42.628
Oh, shit. Cow tipping is the fucking greatest!
Punch it in.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.877
Shit. On the count of three, guy.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.038
One...

41:51.120 --> 41:52.951
two... three!

42:02.720 --> 42:06.952
When I get that feeling,
I need sexual healing.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.110
Yeah, right, asshole.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.516
What is this shit?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.753
Doing a favour for Heather. Double date.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.957
I tried to tell you at the funeral
but you rode off.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.996
Another fucking Heather.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.908
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a little superior tonight.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.076
Seven schools in seven states

42:42.160 --> 42:45.550
and the only thing different
is my locker combination.

42:48.280 --> 42:53.195
Our love is god. Let's go get a slushie.

43:03.920 --> 43:08.710
I'm not belittling the foodless fund, Peter,
but we're talking teen suicide here.

43:08.800 --> 43:13.749
The number one song in America today
is Teenage Suicide Don't Do It by Big Fun.

43:13.840 --> 43:18.755
Westerburg finally got one of these things
and I'm not gonna blow it.

43:18.840 --> 43:23.595
So Heather gets the front page and
I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.

43:23.680 --> 43:28.037
Hi, guys, I came to check up
on this week's lunch-time poll topic.

43:28.120 --> 43:31.556
Don't worry about it, Veronica.
Sit down, huh?

43:31.640 --> 43:36.111
That funeral yesterday
must have really been rough, huh?

43:36.200 --> 43:37.599
Oh, yeah.

43:37.680 --> 43:42.549
We were wondering if you had any poems,
artwork that Heather did

43:42.640 --> 43:46.269
that we can put in
the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?

43:46.360 --> 43:48.157
The what?

43:48.240 --> 43:53.951
Look, it's a two-page layout with
her suicide note right up here in the corner.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.399
It's more tasteful than it sounds.

43:58.480 --> 44:02.359
I don't know, Dennis,
this stuff leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.431
Like last night, Veronica?

44:08.200 --> 44:11.112
Excuse me? I don't get it.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.997
You did last night.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.991
Kurt told us of your little date.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.834
Yeah, and? I left him drunk
and flailing in cow shit.

44:18.920 --> 44:22.071
Well, I don't know. He was really detailed.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.390
- Shh.
- Shut up, Courtney.

44:24.480 --> 44:27.438
No, don't shut up.
I'd like to know exactly what I did.

44:28.520 --> 44:32.479
Come on, Veronica.
I'll show you the lunch-time poll topic.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.591
What the fuck?

44:36.680 --> 44:39.717
I rarely listen to Neanderthals like Kurt Kelly

44:39.800 --> 44:41.677
but he said that he and Ram

44:41.760 --> 44:45.878
had a nice little sword fight
in your mouth last night.

44:45.960 --> 44:50.033
Ew! That son of a bitch.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.558
Hi, Kurt?

44:53.640 --> 44:56.279
Hi, this is Veronica Sawyer.

44:56.360 --> 45:01.639
I didn't expect to be calling, either.
I guess my emotions took over.

45:01.720 --> 45:06.396
I was wondering if you wanted those things
you've been saying to really happen.

45:06.480 --> 45:10.439
It's always been a fantasy of mine
to have two guys at once.

45:10.520 --> 45:13.239
Oh, sure, you can write to Penthouse forum.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.549
Yeah, in the woods behind the school.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.437
At dawn.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.476
Don't forget Ram.

45:29.360 --> 45:34.912
Why am I writing a suicide note when we're
just going to be shooting them with blanks?

45:35.000 --> 45:38.037
We're not gonna be using blanks this time.

45:39.160 --> 45:41.196
You can't be serious.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.077
I am.

45:43.160 --> 45:46.072
Listen, my Bonnie and Clyde days are over.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.232
Wait a second, wait a second.
Do you take German?

45:49.320 --> 45:50.912
French.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.514
All right. These are echt Luger bullets.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.876
My grandfather snared
a shitload of them back in WWII.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.349
They're like tranquillisers,

45:59.440 --> 46:04.673
only they break the skin's surface enough
to cause blood but no real damage.

46:04.760 --> 46:08.036
So it looks like
the person's been shot and killed

46:08.120 --> 46:11.430
and really they're just
unconscious and bleeding?

46:11.520 --> 46:13.112
Oh.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.997
Right.

46:15.080 --> 46:19.153
See, we shoot Kurt and Ram,
make it look like they shot each other

46:19.240 --> 46:24.189
and by the time they regain consciousness,
they'll be the laughing stock of the school.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.397
The note's the punch line.
How'd that turn out?

46:27.480 --> 46:30.597
First tell me the similarity is not incredible.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.752
It's incredible similarity.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.996
OK. Ahem.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.750
"Ram and I died the day we realised

46:41.840 --> 46:46.311
"we could never reveal our forbidden love
to an uncaring and un-understanding world.

46:46.400 --> 46:50.518
"The joy we shared in each other's arms
was greater than any touchdown,

46:50.600 --> 46:52.750
"yet we were forced to live the lie

46:52.840 --> 46:56.230
"of sexist, beer-guzzling, jock assholes."

46:56.320 --> 46:58.550
That's perfect.

46:58.640 --> 47:02.110
Let's take a look at some
of the homosexual artefacts

47:02.200 --> 47:04.156
I dug up to plant at the scene.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.559
All right. An issue of Stud Puppy.

47:08.640 --> 47:11.154
That's great!

47:11.240 --> 47:15.518
A candy dish, a Joan Crawford postcard.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.511
Good.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.556
Some mascara.

47:20.720 --> 47:25.316
All right, now, here's the one perfecto thing
I picked up -

47:25.400 --> 47:26.549
mineral water.

47:26.640 --> 47:31.475
Come on, a lot of people
drink mineral water. It's come a long way.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.278
Yeah, but this is Ohio.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.955
If you don't have a brewski in your hand,
you might as well be wearing a dress.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.235
Oh, you're so smart.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.950
Hi, Veronica.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.951
Hi, guys.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.116
Glad you could make it.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.516
So should I just whip it out or...

48:08.600 --> 48:12.639
Well, I've made a circle
on each side of the clearing.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.154
Ram, you come over here.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.673
Kurt.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.796
When you get to the circle, strip.

48:21.880 --> 48:23.836
What about you?

48:23.920 --> 48:27.276
I was hoping you could
rip my clothes off me, sport.

48:28.800 --> 48:30.153
Oh.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.878
Good idea.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.071
OK. Count of three, guys.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.638
One...

48:49.280 --> 48:50.998
two...

48:52.560 --> 48:55.313
Three!

48:57.800 --> 48:59.756
You missed him completely?

48:59.840 --> 49:01.831
It was worth it just to see the look...

49:01.920 --> 49:04.798
Don't move. I'll get him back.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.752
Ha!

50:10.720 --> 50:12.711
- No.
- Now!

50:23.800 --> 50:26.360
- Hey, I heard it that time.
- What?

50:26.440 --> 50:28.510
Another gunshot from the woods.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.556
Oh, shit. Let's roll!

50:30.640 --> 50:32.517
Kurt doesn't look too good.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.716
Just remember he's left-handed.

50:34.800 --> 50:38.076
Keep going until you hit the clearing.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.276
Come on.

50:44.360 --> 50:46.715
- Mother of shit!
- Call in.

50:46.800 --> 50:51.112
Hey, I heard something out there.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.156
I'm checking it out.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.869
This is Officer McCord.
I've got two dead bodies in the woods

50:56.960 --> 50:58.712
behind Westerburg High.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.476
Whoa! Whoa!

51:44.920 --> 51:48.799
'Milner, can you hear me?
What's going down? '

51:48.880 --> 51:52.589
Yeah... I think what I heard
was just a bunny rabbit.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.355
All I've got here is two kids
making out in a station wagon.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.317
'Should I pry them apart? '

51:58.400 --> 52:01.551
No. Forget it.
I got all the answers back here.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.278
Hey...

52:03.360 --> 52:05.920
are they naked?

52:17.240 --> 52:19.879
Yeah, so what's the deal?

52:19.960 --> 52:23.475
Suicide. Double suicide.
They shot each other.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.596
Hey, that's Kurt Kelly.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.069
Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.629
Phew. My God, suicide. Why?

52:34.920 --> 52:37.912
Does this answer your question?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.309
Oh, man. They were fags.

52:40.400 --> 52:45.030
Listen up. "We realised we could never
reveal our forbidden love

52:45.120 --> 52:48.430
"to an uncaring
and un-understanding world."

52:48.520 --> 52:51.193
Jesus H Christ!

52:51.280 --> 52:54.113
The quarterback buggering the linebacker.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.111
What a waste.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.156
Oh, the humanity.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.469
So we killed them, didn't we?

53:35.560 --> 53:37.676
Yeah. Of course.

54:02.760 --> 54:06.230
Echt Luger bullets. I'm such an idiot.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.989
Look, you believed it
because you wanted to believe it.

54:13.080 --> 54:17.835
Your true feelings
were too gross and icky for you to face.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.953
I did not want them dead.

54:23.520 --> 54:26.557
- You did too.
- I did not.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.868
Did too.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.279
- I did not.
- Did too.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.191
- Did not.
- Did too.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.475
- Did not! Did not!
- Did too!

54:33.560 --> 54:35.630
Shut up! I did not want them dead.

54:35.720 --> 54:39.030
- Come on, you did. You're just...
- # Mary had a little lamb... #

54:39.120 --> 54:42.669
I did not!

54:43.920 --> 54:45.512
Young love!

54:45.600 --> 54:49.354
School's cancelled today
because Kurt and Ram killed themselves

54:49.440 --> 54:51.431
in a repressed homosexual suicide pact!

54:51.520 --> 54:53.476
No way.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.312
God!

54:58.880 --> 55:02.270
The football season is over, Veronica.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.113
Kurt and Ram
had nothing to offer the school

55:05.200 --> 55:07.236
but date rapes and AIDS jokes.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.750
Sure.

55:11.960 --> 55:14.952
Can we make an ice run
before the funeral?

55:21.200 --> 55:24.237
If there's any way
you can hear me, Kurt buddy...

55:26.800 --> 55:30.270
I don't care that
you really were some... pansy.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.911
You're my own flesh and blood

55:34.000 --> 55:35.956
and you made me proud.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.432
My son's a homosexual and I love him.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.756
I love my dead, gay son.

55:47.040 --> 55:51.989
How do you think he'd react to a son
that had a limp wrist with a pulse?

56:08.000 --> 56:13.438
'Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit
has a body count.

56:13.520 --> 56:16.671
'The most popular people
in school are dead.

56:16.760 --> 56:21.356
'Everybody's sad
but it's a weird kind of sad.

56:21.440 --> 56:26.594
'Suicide gave Heather depth,
Kurt a soul, Ram a brain.

56:27.720 --> 56:29.676
'I don't know what it's given me

56:29.760 --> 56:34.311
'but I've got no control
over myself when I'm with JD.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.278
'Are we going to prom or to hell? '

56:37.360 --> 56:42.275
Now, it seems we were in
a similar position on Monday

56:42.360 --> 56:45.397
when I thoughtfully suggested
we get everybody together

56:45.480 --> 56:48.517
for an unadulterated
emotional outpouring, but no.

56:48.600 --> 56:52.559
You took this as an opportunity
to play yet another round

56:52.640 --> 56:54.915
of "let's laugh at the hippy".

56:55.000 --> 56:58.390
- Pauline...
- Shut up, Paul.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.675
I've seen a lot of bullshit -

57:00.760 --> 57:03.274
ángel dust, switchblades,

57:03.360 --> 57:07.353
sexually perverse photography exhibits
involving tennis rackets -

57:07.440 --> 57:09.556
but this suicide thing...

57:10.840 --> 57:14.799
guess that's more on Pauline's wavelength.

57:14.880 --> 57:17.553
We're just going to write off today

57:17.640 --> 57:23.033
and on Friday she can hold
her little love-in or whatever.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.232
Whatever.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.239
Attention!

57:34.680 --> 57:37.240
May I have your attention, please?

57:37.320 --> 57:41.359
This school has been
torn apart by tragedy.

57:41.440 --> 57:45.149
I'm here today to fuse it back again
through togetherness.

57:45.240 --> 57:48.596
I want everyone to clasp hands.

57:48.680 --> 57:52.389
We need to connect this cafeteria
into one mighty circuit!

57:52.480 --> 57:55.392
- Excuse me.
- Here comes the TV crew!

57:55.480 --> 57:57.232
Lock your paws!

57:57.320 --> 57:59.959
- We're ready when you are.
- Hi, there.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.993
Come on. Let's go. Here.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.913
This will be on TV.
Let's show them how you feel!

58:08.000 --> 58:11.390
Looks like Miss Phlegm's
on another one of her crusades.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.550
With usual success, of course.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.392
Come on, get up!

58:15.480 --> 58:17.118
Hi, what's your name?

58:17.200 --> 58:18.997
I'm Heather Duke.

58:24.520 --> 58:27.910
Is this as good for you as it is for me?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.639
Those fish sticks can wait. Let's go.

58:30.720 --> 58:32.676
Come on, kids!

58:34.520 --> 58:36.795
The whole world is watching!

58:39.120 --> 58:41.315
Show them that you care!

58:42.400 --> 58:45.039
Greetings and salutations.

58:45.120 --> 58:49.875
I'll need a VHS copy of this by Monday
for my Princeton application.

58:51.280 --> 58:54.909
You can beat this,
don't let suicide get you down.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.668
That thing this afternoon,

58:58.760 --> 59:01.513
I'm so angry, it was chaos, fucking chaos.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.837
What are you talking about?

59:04.920 --> 59:08.629
I mean, today was great.
Chaos was great.

59:08.720 --> 59:12.030
Chaos is what killed the dinosaurs, darling.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.436
Face it, our way is the way.

59:15.520 --> 59:17.954
We scare people into not being assholes.

59:18.040 --> 59:20.634
Our way is not our way.

59:20.720 --> 59:23.553
Oh, yeah? Tell that to the judge, all right?

59:23.640 --> 59:25.471
Tell it to Kurt Kelly.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.915
I'm telling it to you.

59:30.280 --> 59:32.350
God, you can be so immature.

59:32.440 --> 59:36.035
Oh! You kids are making
too much damn noise.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.750
We beat the bitches.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.308
Beautiful. The beaver's home.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.358
Judge told them to slurp shit and die.

59:45.440 --> 59:48.955
I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.

59:49.040 --> 59:51.429
Masterful.

59:51.520 --> 59:54.353
And then when that blew,

59:54.440 --> 59:57.591
it set off a pack of thermals I stuck upstairs.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.589
Some days it's great to be alive.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.429
Stick it to those goddamn...

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.476
Do you like your father?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.354
Never given the matter much thought.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.196
Liked my mother.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.072
They said her death was an accident

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.993
but she knew what she was doing.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.949
She walked into the building two minutes
before my dad blew the place up.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.191
She waved at me and then...

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.236
boom.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.108
'Dudes, if I get one more request
for that Big Fun song,

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.918
'I'm gonna commit suicide.'

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.752
Playing our song.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.479
'Here it is, Teenage Suicide Don't Do It.'

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.236
# Teenage suicide
# Don't do it

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.788
# Teenage suicide
# She blew it

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.950
# Teenage suicide

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.314
# Don't do it... #

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.916
That's it. We're breaking up.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.310
What? You can't bring them back,
you must know that.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.439
I'm not trying to bring anybody back
except maybe myself.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.911
No!

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.198
To think once
I actually thought you were cool.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.717
If you can't deal with me now
then just stay home and shoot your TV,

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.394
blow up a couple toasters or something.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.553
Just don't come to school
and don't mess with me.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.151
You'll be back.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.029
Me and Martha Dumptruck?

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.917
Where did you get this?

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.437
Oh, I just had the nicest little chat
with Ms Dumptruck.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.556
Got along famously.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.996
It's scary how everybody's got
a little story to tell.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.514
Want to see the canoeing shots?

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.431
What is this? Blackmail?

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.670
I'll give you a week's lunch money.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.549
I don't want your money.
I want your strength.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.677
Westerburg does not need
mushy togetherness,

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.955
it needs a strong leader.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.077
Heather Chandler was that leader but...

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.549
But she couldn't handle it.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.631
I think you can.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.676
Moby Dick is dunked.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.436
The white whale drank some bad plankton
and splashed through a coffee table

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.159
and now it's your turn to take the helm.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.356
What about the photographs?

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.876
Oh, don't worry.
I'll ask you to do me a favour

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.030
and it'll be one you'll enjoy.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.714
You'll get the negatives back then.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.550
But in the meantime, strength.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.390
Here's a little gift...

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.630
from Heather to Heather.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.992
- Guess who.
- Heather?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.439
'Hello? '

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.158
Hello, Betty? This is Veronica.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.400
I don't believe it, I'm winning!

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.473
Don't you start getting cocky on me, girl.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.470
I really missed you.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.597
I know I'm not as exciting as
your other friends.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.636
That is bullshit.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.676
Shoot.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.035
Do you know I'm still a virgin?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.192
OK, I French-kissed Al Springer once.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.236
It was a total disaster.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.232
Shoot the ball.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.629
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than
my realities, believe me.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.272
But now, prepare to die.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.112
Ronnie.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.993
You're not just going for those two shots.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.709
I mean, go ahead, knock me out.
It's the only way to win.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.675
It's not my style.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.514
Nice guys finish last, I should know.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.513
Bravo.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.318
Bravo.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.960
Listen, I got to get home, OK?

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.156
OK.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.037
Thanks.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.997
Bye, Betty.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.513
Bye.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.512
Betty, leaving so soon?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.158
I'm red.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.553
'The Westerburg suicides
were tough on all of us,

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.350
'but we shared the pain of losing
three very popular students.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.069
'I came into the cafeteria,
asked them to hold hands... '

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.993
Isn't that that flake
we met at the open house?

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.389
'... burst of cleansing synchronicity,

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.870
'TV cameras happened
onto our path and captured... '

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.520
Cleansing synchronicity?

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.388
Outpouring of emotion?

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.789
Ha! Look! There's Heather.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.713
There's Heather. Where are you, Veronica?

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.511
'Before a teenager decides to kill himself,
there are certain facts that he should know.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:19.391
'After all, this decision affects all of us
and there's only one chance to get it right.'

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.196
'Getting some supervi... '

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.111
Turn that back on.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.509
These programmes are eating suicide up.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.433
They're making it sound like
a cool thing to do.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.469
Are you trying to tell me it's not a time
for troubled youth? Stand up straight.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.757
All we want is to be
treated like human beings,

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.354
not patronised like bunny rabbits.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.590
I don't patronise bunny rabbits.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.671
Treated like human beings?

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.514
Is that what you said,
little Miss Voice-of-a-generation?

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.831
How do you think adults
act with other adults?

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.593
You think it's all just
a game of doubles tennis?

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.116
When teenagers complain
they want to be treated like human beings,

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.998
it's because they are
being treated like human beings.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.551
Well, I guess I picked the wrong time
to be a human being.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.631
Well, you'll live.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.716
Want some pâté?

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.234
Hi, everybody. Door was open.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.675
Veronica, have you heard?

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.115
We were doing Chinese at the food fair

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.510
when we heard Martha Dumptruck
tried to buy the farm.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.434
She belly-flopped in front of a car
wearing a suicide note.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:47.192
Is she dead?

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:50.955
No. That's the punch line.
She's in stable condition.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.068
Just another case of a geek trying to imitate
the popular people and failing miserably.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.116
Is that pâté?

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.630
- I said I was sorry.
- You were out of control.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.792
Heather and Kurt were a shock
but Martha Dumptruck?

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.997
Get crucial. She dialled
suicide hotlines in her diapers.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.196
You're not funny.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:19.438
Look, Martha couldn't take the heat
so she got out of the kitchen.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.229
Just think what a better place this world
would be if every nimrod followed her cue.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:27.198
Just shut up. Hot Probs is on.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:28.759
Oh, shit. Yeah.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.356
'Skipper's OK but sometimes
I feel like I'm on that island

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:36.591
'and Gilligan can be so stupid sometimes... '

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:40.354
If it wasn't for the courage
of the fearless crew,

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:43.591
the Minnow would be lost,
and you are too.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.272
Next call.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:49.273
'Hey, you've got the dog-catcher.'

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:53.716
'My name is Heather.
No... it's not Heather.'

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.036
No, it...

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.155
It's Madonna. Jeez. No, not that.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.630
Hey, babe, I need a name.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.271
My name is Tweety.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.316
'Tweety?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.278
'Ooh, tweet! '

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.112
God has cursed me, I think.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.714
The last guy I had sex with
killed himself the next day.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.516
I'm failing math.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.318
My whole life is a mess.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.278
I'm supposed to be captain of
the cheerleading...

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.591
She knows we listen to this show.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.990
Holy shit! We'll crucify her.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.470
'... my parents are divorced and stuff... '

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.990
'Heather told everyone about Heather.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.989
'Yes, dear diary,
I've cut off Heather Chandler's head

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.436
'and Heather Duke's head
has sprouted in its place

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.511
'like some mythological thing

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.990
'my eighth-grade boyfriend
would have known about.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.958
'Heather's even doing the old note trick.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.799
' I've seen JD's way.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.555
'I've seen Miss Pauline Fleming's way

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.596
'and nothing has changed.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.910
'I guess that's Heather's way.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.719
'And, Jesus, what about JD?

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.189
'I can't get him out of my head.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.714
'Wait. Where's Heather going? '

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.950
Where's Heather going?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.190
She's going to cry.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.954
Fucking child protector caps.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.231
Now where is she going?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.598
Heather.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.999
- What are you trying to do? Kill me?
- What are you trying to do? Sleep?

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.354
Suicide is a private thing.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.954
Heather, you're throwing your life away

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.952
to become a statistic
in the US fucking A Today.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.952
That's the least private thing I can think of.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.998
What about Heather and Kurt and Ram?

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.393
If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.437
Probably.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.276
Hey now, if you were happy
every day of your life,

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.955
you wouldn't be a human being,
you'd be a game show host.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.909
What do you say we knock off early,
buy some shoes, something lame like that?

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.598
OK.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.352
So it's come to this.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.237
Heather Chandler did polls,

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:55.836
I want you to do a petition,
as a favour, as the favour.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.878
You've heard of the group Big Fun, right?

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.157
That's right. Teenage Suicide Don't Do It.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.155
Right. Some teenybopper rag
says that they want to play a prom.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.153
It could be Westerburg's
if we get everybody's John Hancock.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.992
I'll get right on it, coach.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.311
Little gift for you. I won't be needing it.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.232
Heather?

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.514
Veronica.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.194
Colour me stoked, girl.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.316
Everyone's signed this petition,

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.710
even the ones who think
Big Fun are tuneless Eurofags.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.518
People love me.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.511
You haven't signed yet.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.637
People love you but I know you.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.553
Jennifer Forbes told me
the petition she signed

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.189
was to put a hot tub in the cafeteria
and Doug Hilton said...

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.272
Some people need
different kinds of convincing.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.635
Just sign the petition, OK?

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.631
Don't talk to me like that, OK?

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.029
Look, it was JD's idea.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.796
He made out the signature sheet
and everything so why not just sign it?

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.154
No.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.958
Jealous much?

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.231
Heather, why can't you just be a friend?
Why are you such a megabitch?

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.351
Because I can be.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.995
Veronica, why are you pulling my dick?

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.039
Do you think if Betty Finn's
fairy godmother made her cool,

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.351
she'd still hang out
with her dweebette friends?

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.670
No way, Veronica.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.591
Uh-uh.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.909
Want to go out tonight?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.878
Catch a movie, some miniature golf?

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.080
I was thinking more along the lines
of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open,

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.310
making it look like a suicide.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.119
Now you're talking. I could be up for that.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.670
I've already started
underlining meaningful passages

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.957
in her copy of Moby Dick,
if you know what I mean.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.516
I knew you'd be back, Veronica.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.638
I knew it. I was positive sure.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.036
It's over, JD, over.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.678
Grow up!

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.591
You don't get it.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.750
You were wrong. I was right.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.316
Strength, damn it!

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.556
Come on, come back!

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.471
Yes?

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.997
Your friend Jason Dean stopped by.
He seemed very concerned about you.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.675
He said he thought
you might try to kill yourself.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.716
You have been depressed lately.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.756
Oh, he left this for you.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.836
Oh, my God.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.833
He said that we should
keep you away from sharp objects,

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.071
closed garage doors,
chemical, uh, substances.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.038
- Prescription drugs.
- Prescription drugs.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:26.910
"To neither love
nor reverence wilt thou be kind,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.437
"and even for hate thou canst but kill,

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.670
"and all are killed."

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.199
I like it.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.669
It's got that what-a-cruel-world

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.197
so let's-toss-ourselves-in-the-abyss
type of ambiance, huh?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.992
Come on. It's Heather's copy of Moby Dick.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.238
Why don't you give it a try?
Underline something.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.834
Get off of my bed, you fucking psycho!

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.799
You think you're a rebel?
Do you actually think you're a rebel?

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.792
You're not a rebel.
You're fucking psychotic.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.034
You say "tom-ay-to", I say "tom-ah-to".

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.031
Hold it.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.351
Eskimo. Look at that.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.034
That's one word. I love it!

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.511
I usually go for the whole sentence myself
but this is perfecto.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.275
Eskimo, you know, it's so, uh, mysterious.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.995
Eskimo.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.596
Come on.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.475
JD, you are not listening to me.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.988
Nag. Nag. Nag. Nag. Nag!

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.075
Th-th-that knife is filthy.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.675
Do you think I'm going to
take out her tonsils with it?

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.070
Excuse me, I think I know Heather
a little better than you do.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:01.358
If she was going to slit her wrists,
the knife would be spotless.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.391
How's this? Can you see your fucking
reflection in the thing?

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.397
Tomorrow someone else
will move into her place.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.592
That person could be me.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.750
Ha! There's only one of us
knows Heather's handwriting.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.310
If you think I'll write another suicide note,
you're wrong.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.039
You don't get it! Society nods its head

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.636
at any horror the American teenager
can think to bring upon itself.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.157
Nobody's going to care about
exact handwriting. Help me. Quick.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.230
Life sucks.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.316
It's perfecto.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.115
Jesus, I've got
a meaningfully marked-up Moby Dick.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.555
What else does a suicide need, huh?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.596
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.592
No!

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.716
Open the door!

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.356
Eskimo.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.236
Heather Duke underlined a lot of things
in this copy of Moby Dick

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.199
but I believe the word Eskimo,

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.635
underlined all by itself,

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.508
is the key to understanding Heather's pain.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.593
On the surface, Heather Duke
was the vivacious young lady

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.955
we all knew her to be...

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.669
but her soul was in Antarctica,

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:04.790
freezing with the knowledge
of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel...

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.635
the way that parents can be unresponsive...

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.998
and as she writes so eloquently
in her suicide note,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.038
the way that life can suck.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.231
We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.951
Let's just hope
she's rubbing noses with Jesus.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.190
Is this turnout weak or what?

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.597
I had at least 70 more people at my funeral.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.428
Heather?

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.436
Oh, God, Veronica,

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.830
my afterlife is so boring.

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.718
If I have to sing Kumbaya one more time...

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.438
What are you doing here?

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.114
I made your favourite -

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.350
spaghetti.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.396
Lots of oregano.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.711
Dinner!

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.596
Veronica! Dinner!

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.837
'Dear diary, last entry.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.672
'No one can stop JD -

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:41.639
'not the FBI, the CIA or the PTA.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.111
'He once told me that
the extreme always makes an impression.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.952
'Well, now it's my turn.

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.830
'Let's see how the son of a bitch reacts
to a suicide he didn't perform himself.'

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.117
I can't believe you did it.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.156
I was teasing.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.993
I loved you.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.038
Sure, I was coming up here to kill you.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.911
First I was going to try and get you back
with my amazing petition.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.117
It's a shame you can't see what
our fellow students really signed.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.836
All right, listen.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.677
"We students of
Westerburg High will die. Today.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.309
"Our burning bodies
will be the ultimate protest

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.312
"to a society that degrades us.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.356
"Fuck you all."

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.432
It's not very subtle, but, uh, neither's
blowing up a whole school, now, is it?

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.594
Talk about your suicide pacts, huh?

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.918
When our school blows up tomorrow,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.073
it's going to be the kind of thing
to infect a generation!

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.709
I mean, it's going to be
a Woodstock for the '80s.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.036
Damn it, Veronica.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.592
We could have
toasted some marshmallows together.

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.073
What does she want? A written invitation?

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.151
Veronica! Dinner!

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.992
Sheesh.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.836
Veronica, I...

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.595
Oh, I... I... I should have let you
take that job at the mall.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.356
It was just that I was afraid of you
coming home late at night and I...

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.798
Hey, Mom, why so tense?

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.677
Hey, Prob, I need some help
with my homework.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.797
Uh, not right now, tiger. I'm a little busy.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.792
Veronica, JD told me
you committed suicide last night.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.555
- Where is he? Where's JD?
- We have to talk.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.555
Whether to kill yourself or not is the most
important decision a teenager can make.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.039
Get a job.

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.229
Rodney, where's everybody going?

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.228
- It's Friday.
- Shit, another damn pep assembly.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.632
Yeah. You know, these things,
they get pretty artificial

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.518
but you know, at least you get out of class.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.353
Rodney, what's underneath the gym?

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.036
The boiler room.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.714
May I see your hall pass?

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.878
I knew that loose was too noose.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.998
I mean, uh, noose too loose.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.276
Goddamn you, woman.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.196
Like father, like son.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:01.717
A serious-as-fuck bomb in the boiler room
to set off a pack of thermals upstairs.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.069
Ok, let's start by putting the bomb down
on the ground.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.672
I knew that.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.917
I knew that.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.117
OK, put your hands on your head.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.356
You didn't say "Simon says".

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.952
Let's go!

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.349
Let's go, Rottweilers, let's go!

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:54.111
Let's go, Rottweilers, let's go!

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.114
W- E-S!

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.430
- T-E-R!
- T-E-R!

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.080
- B-U-R!
- B-U-R!

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.673
- G!
- G!

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.149
- What does it spell?
- Westerburg!

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.198
- Again!
- Westerburg!

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.271
Westerburg!

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.955
Lean to the left, lean to the right!

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.350
Stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight!

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.919
Stop!

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:53.274
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.629
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.998
You think because
you started this you can end it?

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.072
I'll kill, I'll fucking kill you, I swear to God.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:46.193
How do I turn off the bomb, asshole?

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.157
Fuck you!

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.631
Shit!

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.599
It's all over, JD. Help me stop it.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.313
You want to clean the slate as much as I do.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:20.558
All right, so maybe I am
killing everyone in the school...

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.596
because nobody loves me.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.873
Let's face it, all right?
The only place different social types

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.236
can genuinely get along
with each other is in heaven.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.434
Which button do I press to turn it off?

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.954
Try the red one, all right?

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.679
People are going to look at
the ashes of Westerburg and say,

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.672
"Now, there is a school that self-destructed,

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.470
"not because society didn't care
but because the school was society!"

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.312
It's pretty deep, huh?

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.391
Which red button?

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.832
Press the middle one to turn it off...

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.876
if that's what you really want.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.474
You know what I want, babe?

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.868
What?

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.394
Cool guys like you out of my life.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.276
Colour me impressed.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:21.756
You, uh, you really fucked me up
pretty bad, Veronica.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.036
You, um...

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.556
you got power.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.956
Power I didn't think you had.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.472
The slate is clean.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.554
Pretend I did blow up the school...

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.676
all the schools.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.036
Now that you're dead,

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.509
what are you going to do with your life?

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.233
Veronica... you look like hell.

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.675
Yeah? I just got back.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.556
Veronica, what are you doing?

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.358
Heather, my love,

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.590
there's a new sheriff in town.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.876
Hey, Martha!

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.396
My date for the prom
kind of flaked out on me.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.153
If you aren't doing anything that night,

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.869
maybe we can rent some new releases,
pop some popcorn.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.832
I'd like that.

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:21.673
Yeah. So would I.

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.917
# When I was just a little girl

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.235
# I asked my mother, what will I be?

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.993
# Will I be pretty?

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.038
# Will I be rich?

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.238
# Here's what she said to me

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.917
# Que será, será

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.030
# Whatever will be

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.350
# Will be

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.470
# Will be

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:39.193
# The future's not ours to see

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.710
# Well, well, well, well, ohh

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:50.750
# Que será, que será

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.070
# Que será

01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:01.631
# When I grew up and fell in love

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:07.670
# I asked my lover, what will I be?

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:14.598
# Will I be rich day after day?

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.912
# Here's how my lover said

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.155
# Que será, será

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.834
# Yeah

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:34.870
# Whatever will be

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.791
# Will be

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.319
# Will be

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.197
# Que será, será

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.038
# Whatever will be
# Whatever

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.190
# Will be

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.236
# Will be

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.878
# Will be

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.512
# The future's not ours to see

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.152
# Que será
# Que será

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.878
# Will be

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.916
# Que será

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.110
