Kamal asked his mother not

Ravi put a scare

13:33.800 --> 13:35.200

22:06.600 --> 22:09.160
Are you kidding me?

22:09.240 --> 22:12.520
Now, are we working the facts
here, or speculating?

22:12.600 --> 22:14.000
What the hell do we have?

22:14.080 --> 22:15.520
Kamal's splitting time
between school

22:15.600 --> 22:17.040
and driving for Speedy Eats.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.720
But some of his shift times
don't add up.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.600
How so?

22:21.680 --> 22:23.400
Well, there's about a dozen
instances where

22:23.480 --> 22:25.720
his Speedy Eats log show him
making deliveries

22:25.800 --> 22:28.040
at the same time he's confirmed
to be in class.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.000
What if Daria was making
deliveries as well?

22:30.080 --> 22:31.520
While Kamal was in class.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.480
It's possible.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.080
The software tracks
the driver's itinerary.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.720
Where they made deliveries,
how long they were parked.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.560
A lot of the time when Kamal
was in class,

22:40.640 --> 22:43.200
the car was stopped at
the same address for hours.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.680
She works at her brother Dylan's
barber shop.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.600
773 East Cordova.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.960
The Wolf.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
That's no barber shop.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.200
It's a dive bar.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.960
Sketchy as hell.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.160
Let's question the brother, find
out what Daria's been up to.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.920
Let's leave the Sharma
family alone.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.200
[sighs]

23:21.600 --> 23:23.760
You guys cops?

23:23.840 --> 23:25.120
Your sister Daria?

23:25.200 --> 23:27.440
We were hoping to speak
with her.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.880
Haven't seen her
since yesterday.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.800
I sent her home early.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.640
Kamal's death hit her hard.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.680
I can imagine.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.920
I understand they were engaged?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.360
Yeah.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.400
He took her up to Lynn Canyon
last week

23:38.480 --> 23:39.760
with a bottle of champagne.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.640
He proposed on the Twin
Falls Bridge.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.240
They socialize much?

23:43.320 --> 23:44.320
Hang out with friends?

23:44.400 --> 23:47.240
Part of any groups?

23:47.320 --> 23:49.280
Kamal was murdered.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.600
If your sister and him
were into something,

23:51.680 --> 23:53.600
she could be in danger too.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.120
They weren't into anything
except each other.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.360
Did anything happen between
them recently?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.000
Before Kamal died?

24:00.080 --> 24:03.320
He erased her from his phone.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.040
They had a fight.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.440
She wouldn't say about what,
but he walked out on her.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.880
I chocked it up to be
a lover's spat.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.000
Usually, someone doesn't
end up dead.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.640
How long has Daria
worked here for?

24:15.720 --> 24:17.120
A couple years,
on and off.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.560
How'd she meet Kamal?

24:20.640 --> 24:23.880
He came in here one day,
and the two of them hit it off.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.480
It was crazy.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.880
How so?

24:26.960 --> 24:29.360
She dated losers
before she met Kamal.

24:29.440 --> 24:33.160
Then it was love at first sight,
if you believe in that.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.240
I'd never seen her happier.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.520
She liked to hang out
at The Wolf?

24:38.600 --> 24:40.000
Not anymore.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.040
Daria gave that up,
joined a group.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.800
Got her act together.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.840
She was an alcoholic?

24:45.920 --> 24:48.520
I got work to do.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
Have her call us.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.400
The brother hasn't heard
from Daria Nichols

24:56.480 --> 24:58.840

early yesterday.

Porsche Cayenne.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.240

25:12.440 --> 25:13.720
What do you know about
the place?

25:13.800 --> 25:15.640
Yeah, he won't
get anything there.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.480
They run an illegal
poker game in the back,

25:17.560 --> 25:19.640
it's a magnet for gang members.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.000
They're not too fond of cops.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.800
Her brother said that Daria
stopped going there,

25:24.880 --> 25:26.600
joined a help group.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.240
Daria had the four card suits
tatted across her fingers,

25:29.320 --> 25:31.840
and may have been talking about
a gambling problem.

25:31.920 --> 25:32.840
You have a contact there?

25:32.920 --> 25:34.160

25:34.240 --> 25:35.280
He's not going to talk
to this guy.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.280
Sounds promising.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.120
Take him along.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.880

Are you sleeping?

I mean.

Hot.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.840
So what's the problem?

26:24.920 --> 26:27.360
He's getting serious.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.160
And that's not something
you want?

26:29.240 --> 26:31.240
I like to keep things casual.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.400
It's better that way.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.160
Nobody gets disappointed.

Did she say why she
invited you?

27:07.080 --> 27:08.840

how in politics,

27:08.920 --> 27:11.040
you show the voter
what matters to you.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.400
And you think it's because
you're a biracial cop

27:13.480 --> 27:16.000
and it's good for her
mayoral campaign.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.040
What if she was speaking
her truth?

27:21.120 --> 27:25.880
That she was showing her
voters what matters to her?

27:25.960 --> 27:27.760
I don't know about that.
