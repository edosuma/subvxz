01:13.615 --> 01:15.617
Why did you do this?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.796
No, but that's too much, Ana. Too much.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.468
I thought a few newspapers,
not the whole neighborhood.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.973
I'm illegal.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.605
I'm about to hit you
upside the head, cabrón!

01:45.688 --> 01:48.942
Look, Casimiro…
I'll let you give him a coscorrón.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.452
No. That's for the
green card? No, I don't need interviews.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.137
What the hell are you doing here?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.397
What the…

02:29.274 --> 02:30.859
What else haven't you told me?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.070
Mmm? Tell me. Right now.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.747
How?

02:46.624 --> 02:47.458
Two months?

02:56.050 --> 03:01.306
Don't tell me. You and Lidia
got married and are moving to England.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.684
Not that far, Pop.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.731
Erik, stop apologizing. I'm proud of you.

03:09.814 --> 03:13.443
You and Lidia are going to make
a beautiful home in Palo Alto.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.781
Yes, mijo. But right now, all I want is to
take a hot shower and not talk to anybody.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.705
You're going to be famous.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.585
Like that little Cuban kid,
Elián González.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.130
But you're uglier. You're screwed.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.423
Go on, little punk.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.428
They're deporting your dad,
and you got jokes.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.735
"Mijo, if you come home
from school and the house is empty,

04:37.819 --> 04:39.445
call tia Cuca."

04:39.529 --> 04:41.197
Tia Cuca is dead.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.241
She can't help.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.528
Help me?

05:22.238 --> 05:26.284
So the whole world knows my problems?

06:28.763 --> 06:30.390
Are you sure?

06:32.975 --> 06:34.811
Yes, I'm sure.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.773
You want to help me?

06:40.566 --> 06:41.567
Then help me.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.688
Why not?
You're leaving.

07:22.942 --> 07:27.071
We have a few months before
they kick us to the street like vermin.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.583
And in six months?

07:38.666 --> 07:41.836
When I'm no longer here,
what will this shop matter?

07:55.183 --> 07:58.019
I have many reasons.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.480
I'll have money to give you all.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.690
It's the only thing
I have to give you all.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.446
I'm buying a ranch in Mexico.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.157
My son is helping me.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.540
Well, yes!

08:19.624 --> 08:21.167
That's what I'm going to do.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.960
You know what I'll call her?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.962
Salma Junior.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.091
I don't want these people
to know my business.

08:34.096 --> 08:38.559
Stop, Ana!
You're asking for too much.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.852
You don't understand

08:40.353 --> 08:43.523
because you don't know
what it's like to live without papers.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.191
You'll never understand! Never!

13:13.501 --> 13:15.795
This church is really bohemian.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.827
Well, not to be rude…

13:48.702 --> 13:50.704
but you're both moving.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.915
You'll have to fly to visit me.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.210
What's the difference
between here or Mexico?

14:01.048 --> 14:02.675
Things change.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.344
You don't tell the chicken
where to lay her eggs.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.179
You just pick them up where they land.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.079
Come on, your turn.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.646
Jeez, this baby really
doesn't want to get baptized.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.233
Hey.
Since when do you like SpongeBob?

17:48.317 --> 17:52.237
Your favorite's
always been the Ninja Turtle one.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.250
Huh, little one?

18:06.502 --> 18:09.088
They still haven't picked that thing up?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.050
Chris rented it for a week.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.928
He needs it.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.972
He said it helps his anxiety.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.604
What's up, chulo? Tell me.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.316
Lupita.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.068
We need to talk.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.946
I need to…

18:34.029 --> 18:35.864
You want to go to Mexico.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.200
How did you know?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.660
I'm not dumb.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.621
Gossip travels fast.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.541
Why ignore the inevitable?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.419
My dad always said…

18:51.171 --> 18:53.423
"It's better to prepare for the worst."

18:55.342 --> 18:58.178
So you're saying
there's nothing here worth fighting for?

18:59.304 --> 19:00.764
No, it's not about that.

19:01.765 --> 19:06.019
I have to do what's best for my family.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.692
Selling the house is what's best.

19:12.276 --> 19:18.782
To help my grandkids with their dreams,
help Beatriz, help you.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.331
Darling, I had to take care of everything.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.419
You'll be able to buy a new laptop,

19:30.502 --> 19:34.089
new clothes, save for your college…

19:59.156 --> 20:01.617
If we do it,
I want to do it my way.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.785
Casimiro, so good to see you.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.957
Well, Pop, what is your way?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.459
Well…

20:11.043 --> 20:16.882
We sent the petition
for Ernesto to sign my green card.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.261
And I know I have to gather

20:21.345 --> 20:25.182
more support to fight those racist judges…

20:25.766 --> 20:27.100
that want to deport me.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.852
Bunch of assholes, yep.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.189
Yes! Bunch of asshole jerks,
good-for-nothing sons-of-bitches.

20:33.941 --> 20:34.983
I want the control.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.029
Control my image, the questions.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.365
And I don't want no damn paparazzi!

21:03.887 --> 21:06.431
If I could give you
all the power in this situation…

21:24.533 --> 21:27.911
Begging people
to not tear my family apart.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.290
It doesn't feel right.

22:37.189 --> 22:42.152
She laughed with me!
She laughed with me!

22:44.279 --> 22:45.614
Picture! Picture!

23:44.673 --> 23:48.218
I'll ask questions,
but you'll look at the camera.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.730
Mr. Morales, can you introduce yourself?

24:03.066 --> 24:04.609
I'm Casimiro Morales.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.236
And I am…

24:07.112 --> 24:08.321
undocumented.
