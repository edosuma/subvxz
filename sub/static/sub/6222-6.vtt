THE DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.097
His name, Merlin.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.531
(WIND WHISTLING)

00:48.966 --> 00:52.386
(CASTING SPELL)

01:06.400 --> 01:09.737
(BABY CRYING)

01:52.530 --> 01:54.657
(FARTING)

02:08.003 --> 02:10.131
Oh, come on! We're going to be late!

02:10.214 --> 02:11.799
Not if you get rid of that thing.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.260
| want you to arrive like
the princess you are.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.429
It's no fun in there.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.849
Fun? Who said anything about fun?

02:19.932 --> 02:22.810
It's certainly no fun chasing after you!

02:23.394 --> 02:24.979
| tried, sir.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.189
I'm sure you did, Grunhilda.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.611
Go on, then.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.072
(MOUTHING)

02:35.156 --> 02:36.240
(GASPS)

02:36.741 --> 02:39.535
(GROANS)

02:43.289 --> 02:45.750
-Perfect.
-Perfect for what?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.544
Certainly not for walking in!

02:49.337 --> 02:50.671
Elena.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.976
Arthur. It is an exciting day.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.604
The arrival of Lord Godwyn
is always a cause for celebration.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.482
-And Princess Elena.
-Yes.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.275
| hear she's something of a beauty.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.861
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.740
Beautiful, charming, witty, strategic.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.785
-Strategic?
-I have always thought so.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.663
We have always thought so.
That is, Lord Godwyn and myself.

03:24.747 --> 03:28.959
That is, he finds you strategic,
not Princess Elena.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.216
-He finds me strategic?
-Oh, yes.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.760
And beautiful?

03:38.469 --> 03:39.887
(DOORS OPEN)

03:44.850 --> 03:48.062
-Father, what are you trying to say?
-Lord Godwyn is a serious ally.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.815
The strength of such a match
cannot be underestimated.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.066
Please tell me you mean
a jousting match?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.692
| mean a love match.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.027
-Love?
-Well, not love.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.321
Love has nothing to do with it.
The other bit.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.741
You know, a permanent union.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.245
-Marriage?
-I knew you'd understand. Godwyn!

04:10.126 --> 04:12.711
Oh, it's been too long.

04:12.795 --> 04:15.172
Princess Elena, you are most welcome.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.971
You've put them in the best
guest quarters?

04:22.053 --> 04:25.099
Everything's arranged. Princess Elena
can't fail to be impressed.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.060
And, Merlin, it would be good if
the bags arrived before they did.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.152
What is it, Arthur? You seem troubled.

04:37.570 --> 04:42.032
My father had some surprising
news for me.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.910
He expects me to marry Princess Elena.

04:44.994 --> 04:45.995
Marry?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.621
Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.458
| wasn't worried.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.585
No.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.462
No, why would you be?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.305
It's strange, isn't it?

05:04.388 --> 05:08.392
Elena couldn't be more different
to Lord Godwyn.

05:08.726 --> 05:09.852
No.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.812
Perhaps she takes after her mother.

05:12.563 --> 05:16.901
| never met her.
She died when Elena was born.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.571
That can't have been easy.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.032
Hmm.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.203
Perhaps you've more in common
than you think.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.622
Oh! Bad breath, for example.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.291
-Excuse me?
-Appalling table manners.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.835
-Uh, now, hang on a minute.
-A good sense of humour.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.921
No. No, you're right.
You have nothing in common.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.385
A word.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.930
Alone.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.815
| need to talk to you about Elena.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.113
| realize that this is
a delicate situation.

06:03.656 --> 06:05.324
There's nothing delicate about her.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.370
Lord Godwyn, as you know,
is not only a very good friend of mine,

06:09.453 --> 06:11.997
but a long-standing ally of Camelot.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.374
I've nothing against Lord Godwyn.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.126
I've nothing against Elena,
except marriage.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.795
When we talk about your future, Arthur,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.005
we're not just talking about
your personal happiness,

06:20.089 --> 06:22.716
but the safety and security
of the whole of Camelot.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.221
You may one day be a husband, but more
importantly you will one day be King.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.057
But I have no feelings
for her, whatsoever.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.309
Then I would encourage you to find some.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.901
(WHIMPERING)

06:48.200 --> 06:50.536
There, there, my sweetheart.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.662
(CRYING OUT)

06:53.539 --> 06:56.083
Soon all this will pass.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.602
(GROWLS)

07:15.311 --> 07:16.353
(SCREAMS)

07:47.384 --> 07:50.763
(CASTING SPELL)

08:36.308 --> 08:39.977
| sincerely hope you bring me good news.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.482
The fathers are committed to the match.

08:44.066 --> 08:47.486
We have waited many years
for this moment.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.656
It's only a matter of time.

08:50.739 --> 08:54.785
Your esteemed majesty,
you have been most patient.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.996
-Your esteemed majesty...
-And the girl?

08:58.747 --> 09:03.877
She has no idea that a fairy lives
inside her, just waiting to emerge.

09:04.086 --> 09:09.174
But that cannot happen until her
marriage to Arthur is complete.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.469
And it will be soon, I promise.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.848
Then you will have what you most desire,

09:16.140 --> 09:19.727
one of your own at the heart of Camelot!

09:22.187 --> 09:24.523
A Sidhe for queen.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.827
Here. Let me assist you.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.872
Oh, please.
This is something I can actually do.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.517
Slow down!

10:00.601 --> 10:02.269
No chance!

10:13.530 --> 10:15.324
That was very impressive.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.785
I'm not easily impressed.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.329
Well, neither am I.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.539
And I wasn't! (SNORTS)

10:23.457 --> 10:24.541
Oh.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.338
I've been riding since I was a child.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.049
| don't get to do it
as much as I'd like.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.051
Princesses don't.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.346
Apparently my mother was
an excellent horsewoman.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.516
| never met her.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.228
| never met mine either.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.565
| often wonder if I'm like her.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.152
| hope I don't take
after my father entirely.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.238
Oh, you don't!

10:55.906 --> 10:58.867
| don't mean that in a bad way.

11:01.787 --> 11:05.457
Uh, so the real reason
why you beat me here

11:05.541 --> 11:07.876
is because I stopped to smell the roses.

11:08.794 --> 11:12.631
Oh. Thank you!

11:14.132 --> 11:16.426
It... It's beautiful.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.765
Ah-choo!

11:26.895 --> 11:28.146
Shall I set up here?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.733
Merlin! What kept you?

11:31.984 --> 11:33.527
Do not leave me again.

11:33.986 --> 11:38.282
You were riding so fast, I thought
you were eager for some time alone.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.452
Nobody likes a clever clogs, Merlin.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.247
No.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.469
Thank you. I had a lovely time.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.888
Me too.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.518
See you soon, I expect.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.230
| hope so.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.783
Oh, dear.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.996
For once, Merlin, I completely agree.

12:30.792 --> 12:35.422
It's a big occasion. The potential
joining of our two families.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.592
Indeed, this union would cement

12:38.675 --> 12:43.013
what has long been an unofficial
alliance between our kingdoms.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.265
It would give me great pleasure.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.727
| can assure you
my heart lies with yours.

12:50.312 --> 12:53.273
As to their hearts, who can say?

12:53.357 --> 12:54.441
No matter.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.277
Affairs of state take precedence
over feelings.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.529
Arthur knows that,
and I'm sure Elena does, too.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.075
May 1?

13:04.493 --> 13:06.620
You've been avoiding my gaze.

13:07.037 --> 13:11.249
No, no. My gaze isn't as sharp
as it used to be.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.169
That's why I thought
I'd move a bit closer.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.880
All the better to appreciate me, eh?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.636
Are you having a good evening?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.554
| intend to!

13:25.097 --> 13:28.392
Oh, yeah. A very good evening indeed.

13:35.691 --> 13:36.942
(HICCUPS) Oh, dear.

13:37.359 --> 13:42.197
| seem to have drunk a little too much
of what is in that glass.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.284
What is in that glass? (HICCUPS)

13:50.539 --> 13:52.749
| think that went okay, don't you?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.002
It'll be just fine, petal.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.171
| mean, I suppose
it could have gone better.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.467
I'm not the perfect princess, am I?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.594
Poppycock!

14:05.012 --> 14:08.557
And what does that mean anyway,
"perfect princess"?

14:09.099 --> 14:11.143
Sounds perfectly boring.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.645
You've got spirit, child.

14:13.729 --> 14:16.523
If Arthur's got half a brain,
he'll recognise that.

14:16.982 --> 14:21.737
And if he doesn't have a brain, well,
you can always marry him for his brawn!

14:22.320 --> 14:25.282
| want to make this work,
for Father's sake.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.493
| know how important it is to him.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.079
And I respect his judgement.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.540
Don't tell him I said that.

14:34.249 --> 14:39.296
| wouldn't dream of it. And you'd
be best keep your doubts to yourself.

14:40.297 --> 14:44.384
These are dangerous times. Marrying
a Pendragon will secure your future.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.471
You're right.

14:50.599 --> 14:54.478
Here, this will cheer you up.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.023
(CROAKING)

15:00.442 --> 15:02.152
Our little secret.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.031
Mmm.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.119
Mmm!

15:11.661 --> 15:13.497
You're very special.

15:14.623 --> 15:15.749
Mmm!

15:16.166 --> 15:18.877
Believe me, I know.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.118
(TONGUE SLAPPING)

15:57.082 --> 15:59.209
(BUZZING)

15:59.417 --> 16:00.794
(TONGUE SLAPPING)

16:16.601 --> 16:18.061
(LAUGHS)

16:21.773 --> 16:24.693
I've seen some strange
tongues in my time.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.821
Maybe she was suffering from an
infection? Was it discoloured?

16:27.904 --> 16:30.073
Discoloured? Yes.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.408
-Brown?
-Purple.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.953
And long. Like...

16:39.416 --> 16:40.917
This long.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.628
That's not an infection.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.881
No. It's magic.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.218
Some sort of magical creature has
infiltrated Lord Godwyn's household.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.803
The question is, why?

16:52.262 --> 16:56.766
| don't know, but I have a feeling
we should probably find out.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.777
-Can I help you?
-I...

17:48.860 --> 17:50.654
Something you need, perhaps?

17:52.489 --> 17:58.453
| wanted to enquire whether Princess
Elena would like a perfume concocting.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.789
Essence of lavender, perhaps?

18:01.915 --> 18:04.251
That is a very bad excuse.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.710
Really?

18:05.961 --> 18:09.339
You don't fool me for one minute.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.177
You were looking for me.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.099
-I was?
-I understand.

18:21.017 --> 18:24.271
-It's all right.
- I think probably I should be going.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.524
Elena won't be back for ages.

18:27.607 --> 18:32.195
Why don't we make
sweet perfume together?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.039
-Pixie dust?
-There's no mistaking it.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.375
Grunhilda is a pixie.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.378
It would explain a thing or two.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.548
If pixies have one weakness,
it is for...

18:53.675 --> 18:56.344
More distinguished gentlemen.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.097
What are you trying to say?

18:59.180 --> 19:04.978
Grunhilda has shown a certain
interest toward me.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.397
She likes you?

19:08.732 --> 19:10.734
Oh, that is disgusting!

19:12.235 --> 19:13.570
Imagine...

19:14.154 --> 19:16.573
Imagine if she kissed you! Urgh!

19:17.198 --> 19:18.408
Merlin!

19:19.909 --> 19:22.037
Pixies are the servants of the Sidhe.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.080
To them, Elena could be very valuable.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.042
| think Elena may be a changeling.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.962
-A changeling?
-Inhabited by a fairy at birth.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.465
It would explain the clumsiness.

19:33.548 --> 19:36.009
And Elena has no idea
this thing's inside of her?

19:36.843 --> 19:40.555
And when the time comes,
it will possess her entirely.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.891
And you think that time is now?

19:44.768 --> 19:47.228
The Sidhe live for more
than a thousand years.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.814
They're patient people.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.527
It may be that they have created
this changeling,

19:54.611 --> 19:57.364
knowing that Lord Godwyn
and the house of Pendragon

19:57.447 --> 20:00.408
would one day seek unity
through marriage.

20:01.659 --> 20:05.080
That would give the Sidhe
something they want more than anything.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.874
A Sidhe queen.

20:12.504 --> 20:17.133
Father, there is a delicate matter
| wish to discuss with you.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.805
Your proposal? Excellent!

20:22.430 --> 20:24.265
You must make a fuss.
Women like that kind of thing.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.810
-Isn't that right, Morgana?
-I've no ideal

20:28.228 --> 20:29.562
I'm delighted to hear the news, though.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.065
-I couldn't be more thrilled.
-She's a wonderful woman.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.858
She'll make a wonderful wife.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.485
No, she won't.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.781
Not for me, anyway.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.746
Father, I have tried to get
to know Elena,

20:46.830 --> 20:49.833
but the truth is
| have no feelings for her.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.460
I'm sure she's a wonderful person,

20:53.211 --> 20:56.923
but I cannot marry someone I don't love.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.676
You can, and you will.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.860
(ELENA CRYING OUT)

21:44.304 --> 21:45.889
You were right.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.057
Poor girl, no wonder
she's got a wind problem!

21:48.141 --> 21:52.228
You should see what she's got trapped
inside her. We have to tell the King.

21:52.312 --> 21:56.191
Merlin, Lord Godwyn is one
of Uther's dearest friends.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.943
Accusing him of having
a Sidhe for a daughter

21:59.027 --> 22:03.072
and a pixie for a nurse is not something
that can be undertaken lightly.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.824
But Uther wants Arthur to marry her.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.451
Then we don't have much time.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.579
We have to find a spell that will force
the fairy out of her.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.581
| don't know anything about Sidhe magic.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.416
Then it's time we learnt.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.523
| wouldn't like to be in Arthur's shoes.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.233
What do you mean?

22:41.653 --> 22:44.197
Forced to marry someone
against his will.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.158
| don't think he'll marry her
if he feels that way.

22:51.913 --> 22:54.457
| know it's hard to believe,
but he may not have a choice.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.377
Even if it isn't what he wants.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.968
Even if his heart belongs to another.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.683
Even if she feels the same way.

23:13.268 --> 23:16.604
Gwen, we've known each other for
too long. I can see it in your eyes.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.275
You like him, don't you?

23:21.317 --> 23:24.487
No. Don't be silly.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.657
And he likes you.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.496
It can never come to anything.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.749
I'd like to think it was possible,

23:38.167 --> 23:39.877
but Arthur can't change
200 years of history,

23:39.961 --> 23:42.338
-no matter how much he may want to.
- I know.

23:55.184 --> 24:00.231
| think my brain is going to burst, or
my eyes just pop out of their sockets.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.775
Well, don't make a mess over this one.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.403
Why? Is it any more useful
than any of the others?

24:05.486 --> 24:06.654
It's the last one we've looked at

24:06.738 --> 24:10.158
and by the ancient law of Sod
it must provide the answer.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.453
Go on.

24:13.536 --> 24:17.373
There is this potion, created long ago
by the Witches of Meredor,

24:17.457 --> 24:22.378
which, if I am right,
will force the fairy out of the girl.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.797
Oh!

24:25.798 --> 24:27.925
I've no idea how to make it.

24:28.009 --> 24:31.554
I've no idea what a lot
of these ingredients are.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.103
Guinevere.

24:39.729 --> 24:42.732
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't
just turn up like this.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.903
Everyone's talking about
your marriage to Elena.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.990
| know you said that it isn't
what you wanted,

24:51.074 --> 24:54.410
but I also know that you can't always
have what you want.

24:56.079 --> 24:58.039
| know that very well.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.334
Is what I want really that insane?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.127
Yes, Arthur.

25:03.211 --> 25:09.467
From anyone's perspective, apart from
yours and mine, it's completely insane.

25:12.929 --> 25:14.931
Then I'm happy being insane.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.478
Surely it's better than being miserable.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.981
| don't think she will
make you miserable.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.277
-She has a good heart.
-As do you.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.866
We both know it can't be.

25:36.953 --> 25:38.663
And if I do it...

25:42.458 --> 25:44.460
If I marry her, what will you do?

25:47.130 --> 25:50.633
| will watch you grow into the King
that Camelot deserves.

25:52.719 --> 25:53.970
It is as it should be.

26:06.315 --> 26:10.027
Please tell me you've fixed the potion.
| have a very bad feeling about this.

26:10.111 --> 26:13.614
The Witches of Meredor are the worst
recipe writers I've known.

26:13.698 --> 26:16.033
-Gaius!
-I'm working on it.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.455
But we need to find the stamen
of a dropwort flower.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.666
They're rarer than a four-leaf clover.

26:39.307 --> 26:43.102
| am honoured to be standing
before you today,

26:43.186 --> 26:46.189
in the presence of our
dear friend Lord Godwyn.

26:48.357 --> 26:52.028
And his wonderful daughter,

26:52.779 --> 26:53.988
Elena.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.159
The people of this kingdom
are very dear to me.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.329
This place is my life.

27:02.163 --> 27:05.124
| hope one day to continue
the good work of my father

27:07.126 --> 27:12.715
and to make Camelot a place
of peace and happiness.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.885
(APPLAUSE)

27:20.056 --> 27:22.975
It is my sincerest hope that you,

27:24.727 --> 27:28.397
Princess Elena, share these dreams.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.236
And with this in mind,
| would like to ask you

27:33.319 --> 27:35.822
to do me the honor
of being my wife.

27:49.293 --> 27:52.713
-I got it!
-Grown in boggy and marshy terrain.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.466
In the middle of boggy
and marshy terrain.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.678
-Right in the middle.
-You did a good job.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.054
This will sort things out.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.348
Hopefully before tomorrow's wedding.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.434
Will it hurt her? When the fairy leaves?

28:05.518 --> 28:07.395
She'll feel like a new person.

28:07.854 --> 28:11.107
She probably doesn't realise how
much trouble it's been causing her.

28:13.192 --> 28:17.822
Oh, master, I am sorry,
but I think we may have a problem.

28:17.905 --> 28:21.576
| may be wrong,
but you know how things are.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.077
Out with it!

28:23.160 --> 28:28.791
The serving boy, Merlin,
knows Elena is a changeling.

28:28.875 --> 28:32.253
So? What can a serving boy do?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.423
He is Arthur's serving boy.

28:36.883 --> 28:40.386
| do not expect he will stay quiet
for long.

28:41.137 --> 28:45.516
Do you know how long I have
waited for this moment?

28:45.600 --> 28:50.271
Yes, sire, and I have been there
with you every second of the way.

28:50.354 --> 28:54.692
You have been there because we
have chosen to keep you there.

28:55.526 --> 28:58.154
If the changeling is discovered,

28:58.863 --> 29:02.617
you will not be so useful any more.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.494
No, sire.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.999
As to this Merlin,

29:10.082 --> 29:14.253
soon he will regret the day
| ever heard his name.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.507
Let him learn who he's angered.

29:19.216 --> 29:23.846
Let him feel the power
of the mighty Sidhe.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.740
(SCREAMING)

30:39.296 --> 30:40.715
Please tell me that wasn't all of it?

30:45.678 --> 30:48.723
| don't think I've ever been so happy.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.349
(BELCHES)

30:50.433 --> 30:53.853
I'm almost as excited
as if it was my wedding day.

30:53.936 --> 30:59.358
In fact, given half a chance,
I'd definitely marry him myself.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.111
-Maybe that's not such a bad idea.
-What?

31:02.403 --> 31:05.114
I'm serious. I don't love him.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.241
He doesn't understand me.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.036
He certainly doesn't love me either.

31:10.119 --> 31:11.954
He respects you.

31:12.455 --> 31:15.833
Yes, and I him. But is that enough?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.461
Well, yes, definitely.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.421
| would say it was enough.

31:20.963 --> 31:25.217
| mean, what is love, anyway?
Here today and gone tomorrow.

31:25.468 --> 31:28.012
Respect, that's what lasts.

31:29.430 --> 31:34.769
Ah, it's just nerves. Understandable,
but not to be listened to.

31:35.144 --> 31:38.105
Silly girl. Oh, I don't know...

31:43.527 --> 31:44.945
That's it?

31:48.449 --> 31:50.493
Oh, thank goodness for that.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.369
Well, there's one more thing.

31:52.453 --> 31:56.165
How are we going to get Elena
to drink it with Grunhilda around?

31:59.168 --> 32:01.003
| think I might know a way.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.637
Well, hello there.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.347
Hello, indeed.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.058
| wonder, could you spare me a moment?

32:14.183 --> 32:16.185
-But of course.
-Not here.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.524
Alone.

32:22.358 --> 32:23.984
The vaults beneath Camelot.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.403
The vaults?

32:26.487 --> 32:28.364
It's a very private place.

32:29.365 --> 32:33.452
-I can't walk in these shoes.
-I have a wedding to prepare.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.746
No one will disturb us.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.208
There may not be another opportunity.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.461
You surprise me, Gaius.

32:43.337 --> 32:45.881
But, oh, what a lovely surprise.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.925
I'll be right there.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.890
You look very handsome.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.642
Perfect bait.

32:56.725 --> 33:01.981
Merlin, if this doesn't work,
if it seems she's overpowering me...

33:02.064 --> 33:05.151
- I will just watch and wait.
-You will rescue me.

33:05.234 --> 33:08.654
And if it does work,
let us never speak of it again.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.739
Hello, my lover!

33:15.286 --> 33:17.580
Oh! What a romantic place!

33:20.166 --> 33:22.251
I've been dreaming of this moment.

33:23.836 --> 33:27.214
-Me too.
-Longing for this time.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.050
Longing.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.262
At last,

33:34.013 --> 33:36.974
we two will be as one.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.110
(CASTING SPELL)

34:00.039 --> 34:03.083
You'll never know what you've missed.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.085
I'll take your word for it.

34:10.632 --> 34:14.553
(CASTING SPELL)

34:18.891 --> 34:21.851
Never speak of it, Merlin.
That's what we agreed.

34:23.478 --> 34:27.858
(CASTING SPELL)

34:38.077 --> 34:40.204
Welcome, welcome.

34:44.625 --> 34:49.838
(CASTING SPELL)

34:53.884 --> 34:54.969
You've got your staff?

34:55.052 --> 34:57.763
When the Sidhe is released,
it might not be very happy.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.598
Don't worry, I'll be ready for it.

34:59.682 --> 35:02.393
You better be ready for me first!

35:13.862 --> 35:16.198
I'll see how long I can hold her off.
You better be quick.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.621
Grunhilda?

35:23.038 --> 35:24.290
It's only me.

35:24.373 --> 35:25.791
Where has she gone?

35:25.874 --> 35:27.543
I'm getting married
in less than an hour.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.669
(CRASHING)

35:28.752 --> 35:29.795
(SHOUTING)

35:29.878 --> 35:33.048
-What was that?
-Uh, preparation for the wedding.

35:33.757 --> 35:37.803
Everybody's very excited.
But you must be nervous.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.805
| am a little flustered.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.141
That is only to be expected,
and just as I thought.

35:42.224 --> 35:44.435
| have brought you a
tonic to calm your nerves.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.104
You are very kind.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.273
(CRASHING)

35:53.610 --> 35:56.405
| cannot believe this is actually
my wedding day.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.907
Best to drink it all,
for the full effect.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.534
(GRUNHILDA CRYING OUT)

36:03.787 --> 36:07.124
-I really wish my mother was here.
-Try another sip.

36:25.893 --> 36:27.311
I'm trying.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.607
Elena, this is going to make you
feel a whole lot better.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.155
(RUMBLING)

36:55.672 --> 36:59.802
Not to worry, my dear, I think you
must have fainted. Such excitement.

36:59.927 --> 37:04.390
Fainted? I feel amazing.

37:05.307 --> 37:07.476
| haven't felt this good in years.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.646
Where is Grunhilda?

37:13.482 --> 37:15.567
-We'll look into it.
-We'll look into it.

37:17.986 --> 37:21.782
-I've brought you your ceremonial sword.
-Is that for me to fall on?

37:21.865 --> 37:23.409
Hopefully not.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.622
What's wrong?

37:28.705 --> 37:30.541
You wouldn't understand, Merlin.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.377
You have no idea what it's like
to have a destiny

37:35.254 --> 37:36.505
you can't escape.

37:39.133 --> 37:43.470
Destinies are troublesome things.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.101
You feel trapped.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.353
Like your whole life has been
planned out for you

37:51.437 --> 37:54.148
and you've got no control over anything,

37:54.231 --> 37:55.816
and sometimes you don't even know

37:55.899 --> 37:59.445
if what destiny has decided
is really the best thing at all.

38:04.533 --> 38:08.328
-How come you're so knowledgeable? Hmm?
-I read a book.

38:14.251 --> 38:17.588
And what would this book tell you?
Should I marry her?

38:19.715 --> 38:20.966
It's not really my place to say, sire.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.010
I'm asking you, it's your job to answer.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.678
If you really want to know
what I think...

38:28.390 --> 38:31.143
| think you're mad.
| think you're all mad.

38:31.226 --> 38:34.521
People should marry for love,
not convenience.

38:34.605 --> 38:37.441
And if Uther thinks an unhappy king
makes for a stronger kingdom,

38:37.566 --> 38:39.818
then he's wrong because you may be
destined to rule Camelot,

38:39.902 --> 38:41.737
but you have a choice

38:44.531 --> 38:46.241
as to how you do it.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.340
(TRUMPETS SOUND)

39:20.275 --> 39:21.652
What do you think?

39:22.611 --> 39:24.071
Beautiful.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.533
There's no other word for it.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.785
Beautiful.

40:00.148 --> 40:04.528
My lords,
ladies and gentlemen of Camelot.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.990
We are gathered here today to celebrate,

40:08.949 --> 40:11.410
by the ancient rite of hand-fasting,

40:11.827 --> 40:16.456
the union of Arthur Pendragon
and Princess Elena of Gawant.

40:22.254 --> 40:26.174
Is it your wish, Arthur,
to become one with this woman?

40:28.635 --> 40:29.845
It is.

40:30.178 --> 40:33.640
Is it your wish, Elena,
to become one with this man?

40:37.894 --> 40:39.146
It is.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.356
Do any say nay?

40:44.484 --> 40:49.781
Then as we gather here today,
we are all witness to this rite...

40:49.865 --> 40:51.033
Wait.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.829
There is something you would like
to say, Arthur?

41:04.671 --> 41:06.798
There's something I should
have said a long time ago.

41:08.842 --> 41:11.261
Something from the heart
| dare not speak.

41:15.932 --> 41:22.230
Elena, you are a wonderful woman,

41:24.316 --> 41:26.276
a beautiful bride.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.237
But I cannot deny my feelings.

41:31.907 --> 41:33.784
You do not love me.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.333
And [ think if you are honest,

41:42.834 --> 41:44.544
you do not love me either.

41:47.214 --> 41:48.340
No.

41:48.423 --> 41:50.467
Then we are both here out of duty.

41:55.931 --> 41:57.933
Can you forgive me?

41:58.016 --> 42:00.268
| agree with all you have said.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.147
Thank you, Arthur.

42:19.705 --> 42:22.290
-What did you think you were doing?
-The right thing, Father.

42:22.791 --> 42:23.917
For who?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.544
For Camelot, or for yourself?

42:25.627 --> 42:27.504
The two things aren't entirely separate.

42:27.587 --> 42:31.341
Until you put duty before your feelings,
you are clearly not ready to be king.

42:31.425 --> 42:33.635
When I'm ready to be king,
I'll be a much better king

42:33.719 --> 42:37.139
for the support and strength
of a woman I love.

42:39.975 --> 42:43.186
| can't imagine what's
happened to Grunhilda.

42:43.270 --> 42:45.230
No. I'm sure she'll turn up.

42:45.313 --> 42:48.442
| hope so. It's most unlike her.

42:53.530 --> 42:55.323
There's something different about her.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.660
You're not changing your mind, are you?

42:59.369 --> 43:02.289
Goodness. No.

43:03.874 --> 43:05.792
| wish you well, Arthur Pendragon.

43:07.169 --> 43:09.546
| hope one day we both
find the love we deserve.

43:14.342 --> 43:18.013
In the meantime, if you ever want
to be beaten in a horse race,

43:18.096 --> 43:20.056
you know where to find me.

43:20.766 --> 43:23.852
He did the right thing, you know.
You mustn't punish him.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.480
They were neither of them in love.

43:26.563 --> 43:29.316
That's not the point.
That's not the way things are done.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.151
Then maybe it's time things changed.

43:31.234 --> 43:34.988
| think he has
the makings of a great king.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.200
You should be proud of him.

43:57.594 --> 44:00.931
So, I'm still a single man.

44:01.640 --> 44:02.891
Indeed.

44:04.559 --> 44:08.146
| don't think you deserved her,
actually. She's really very lovely.

44:08.230 --> 44:09.272
Mmm.

44:09.898 --> 44:14.736
Well, I had hoped to have forsaken
her for one equally as lovely.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.031
Who knows, maybe even more so.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.284
- I do not know of such a person.
-Me neither.

44:23.119 --> 44:26.540
But I guess only time will tell.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.803
Merlin.

44:41.555 --> 44:44.015
-Elyan!
-Brother and sister reunited.

44:44.099 --> 44:46.017
It warms the heart.

44:46.101 --> 44:48.186
What would a man like Cenred
want with us?

44:48.270 --> 44:50.897
You can bring me Arthur Pendragon.

44:51.439 --> 44:52.732
Who did that to you?

44:53.859 --> 44:55.193
There is nothing
he would not do for her.

44:56.486 --> 44:57.571
And once he is dead?

44:58.864 --> 45:01.157
You may take your place
on the throne of Camelot.
