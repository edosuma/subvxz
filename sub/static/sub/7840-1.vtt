00:34.564 --> 00:37.358
Otto, Bart won't
give me a seat.

00:37.384 --> 00:40.200
You know I can deal with your problem
or I can rock out.

00:40.201 --> 00:42.000
But I cannot do both.

00:44.450 --> 00:51.600
We're an American band
We're an American band

00:52.000 --> 00:55.654
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party down

00:55.655 --> 00:58.700
We're an American band....

00:58.800 --> 01:01.000
Otto, help me.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.450
Fu-u-u-u... nk.

01:12.902 --> 01:14.150
What am I hearing now?

01:15.857 --> 01:17.030
Nature?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.090
The ultimate bring-down.

01:19.193 --> 01:20.400
Why...

01:21.006 --> 01:23.438
was I... born?!

01:24.159 --> 01:26.602
Don't worry, dude.
We'll hook you up with some tunes.

01:27.156 --> 01:31.523
Old McDonald had a fart
Fart, fart, fart, fart, fart

01:31.575 --> 01:35.901
And on his farthe had a fart.
Fart, fart, fart, fart, fart.

01:35.948 --> 01:37.302
That's not a song.

01:37.336 --> 01:40.850
Real songs are about deals
with the devil, far-off lands,

01:40.878 --> 01:43.542
and where you'd find smoke
in relation to water.

01:43.605 --> 01:44.703
Mister driver?

01:44.707 --> 01:47.752
One of my bus mates
has purloined my French horn.

01:47.826 --> 01:49.710
Why can't you talk like a dude?

01:49.735 --> 01:52.641
Oh, knock it off, Kearney.
Why are you still in this school anyway?

01:52.645 --> 01:54.551
We were in third grade together.

01:54.575 --> 01:57.001
Stupid school
doesn't know how to teach me.

01:57.257 --> 02:00.343
The farts on the bus
go round and round...

02:03.197 --> 02:06.413
Oh, wow, this is about 90% less funny
than you think it is.

02:06.467 --> 02:10.041
W-wait... the radio.
That'll drown 'em out.

02:11.748 --> 02:12.743
Disco?

02:13.778 --> 02:15.132
Easy listening.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.683
Country Western?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.641
World music?

02:20.177 --> 02:22.153
Urban smooth?

02:22.335 --> 02:24.001
Salsa fusion?

02:29.086 --> 02:30.373
Metallica?

02:31.746 --> 02:34.403
- Am I on drugs?
- Yes, you are,

02:34.466 --> 02:36.182
but that really is Metallica.

02:36.237 --> 02:39.931
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for
a gumdrop parade on Foo-foo Island.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.533
What's up, Metallica?
Need a lift?

02:44.588 --> 02:46.601
We don't take rides
from strangers.

02:46.656 --> 02:48.700
I'm no stranger.
Remember this?

02:48.705 --> 02:51.911
Metallica ru-u-u...les!

02:51.975 --> 02:56.723
Oh, yeah, Springfield Arena, 1997,
Row XX, Seat 64.

02:56.727 --> 02:59.282
I was about to quit the bande
when I saw your lighter.

02:59.325 --> 03:02.443
- You saved me that night.
- So what are you waiting for? Hop in.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.683
Hop in what?

03:05.505 --> 03:09.800
Look at me, I'm Otto. I'm a hundred
years old, and I drive a school bus.

03:12.896 --> 03:17.982
Oh, man. Maybe me and Metallica
can go splitsies on a cab.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.251
Hey, loser, we got a ride
from a real fan.

03:23.257 --> 03:26.800
I used to sleep
with Lars' grandmother.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.801
Never listen to
our music again.

03:40.205 --> 03:42.502
Bye-bye, take care,
watch your step,

03:42.508 --> 03:44.473
eat my shorts,
have a good one.

03:46.015 --> 03:49.473
She's all yours, dude.
Oh, and I think I
ran over a moose.

03:52.987 --> 03:57.751
This is for every bus driver,
lunch lady, gym coach, hall monitor...

03:57.756 --> 04:00.543
Otto.
Are you meting out
corporal punishment?

04:00.548 --> 04:03.802
Can't... talk... now.
I'm spanking a child.

04:04.006 --> 04:07.552
You are temporarily suspended
from bus driving, with pay.

04:07.557 --> 04:10.713
- No...!
- Hand in your beaded seat-cover.

04:12.188 --> 04:13.520
And your gun.

04:16.278 --> 04:19.180
I hope you're happy, Bart.
Thanks to your hijinks,

04:19.185 --> 04:21.721
I have to drive you and
your friends to school.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.451
Let me drive.
I go through yellow lights.

04:24.457 --> 04:26.373
One more crack out of you,
young man,

04:26.378 --> 04:29.153
and I'm showing everyone
your baby pictures.

04:30.797 --> 04:32.373
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:33.705 --> 04:35.393
Carpool!

04:35.595 --> 04:37.911
I brought my own car seat.
Look.

04:39.907 --> 04:44.050
Hey, Lisa, my safety bar
matches your eyes.

04:48.068 --> 04:50.100
Carpool, Nelson!

04:50.148 --> 04:53.733
Just a sec, I've got to finish
my science project.

04:57.728 --> 05:01.503
Whoa.
"Squirrels don't like rocks."

05:02.808 --> 05:05.303
Okay, just one more
kid to pick up.

05:06.905 --> 05:08.401
Ew, it's Michael.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.753
That weird kid who
never says anything.

05:10.808 --> 05:13.153
He's so gross and stupid.

05:13.157 --> 05:14.381
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Michael.

05:16.206 --> 05:18.632
Hey, dork, you're sittin'
on my shadow.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.843
Sorry.

05:20.048 --> 05:23.051
What, you're too good
to sitn my shadow?

05:23.725 --> 05:25.863
Aw, I forgot my math book.

05:25.866 --> 05:29.003
No problem, I'll just drive
up to your house and get it.

05:36.017 --> 05:38.902
Whoa. Your mother must dance at the
nicest strip club in town.

05:43.555 --> 05:45.963
Michael, my son.
Here is your book,

05:45.976 --> 05:49.940
and never forget:
the divisor goes into the dividend.

05:49.948 --> 05:51.500
Yes, Papa.

05:52.365 --> 05:53.981
That was Fat Tony.

05:54.657 --> 05:56.513
Your dad's a mob boss?

05:58.295 --> 06:00.803
Please don't have me whacked.
I was just kidding around.

06:00.808 --> 06:03.582
We were all having fun.
Wasn't it fun?

06:05.115 --> 06:06.453
Oh, fun is so fun.

06:06.637 --> 06:07.971
There is no Mafia.

06:07.977 --> 06:09.551
Columbus Day
is better than Christmas.

06:16.156 --> 06:17.602
He's Fat Tony's son!

06:19.708 --> 06:22.702
His daddy putted bullets
in my daddy.

06:22.708 --> 06:25.302
My daddy had to potty in a bag.

06:29.688 --> 06:33.901
Ah, look at all this puke!
Why did I come in on my day off?

06:35.465 --> 06:37.253
Oh, Fat Tony's lad!

06:42.707 --> 06:44.003
God bless you.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.603
Oh,  stop, stop!

06:55.665 --> 06:58.801
Who's the out-of-tune idiot
on third clarinet?

06:58.898 --> 07:02.022
- That's me.
- I p-- you didn't
let me finish!

07:02.158 --> 07:04.031
I... from now on you're not
third clarinet,

07:04.037 --> 07:05.970
you're first everything!

07:05.976 --> 07:09.500
Now if you excuse me, I'm brewing tea
and I have to go jiggle my bags!

07:18.335 --> 07:20.941
- You're sitting with me?
- I'm not afraid of you.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.240
Well, you shouldn't be.
I'm not like my dad.

07:23.245 --> 07:26.703
I understand.
I'm not like my dad either.

07:27.265 --> 07:28.253
Oh.

07:33.785 --> 07:37.563
There's  a triple-A battery
in my macaroni and cheese!

07:37.598 --> 07:39.700
It counts
as a vegetable.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.903
I can't eat this.

07:42.005 --> 07:45.201
You know, I cook a little.
Maybe I can make you something.

07:45.278 --> 07:47.210
All we need is some
fresh ingredients.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.960
Well, you're not going
to find any here.

07:57.528 --> 08:00.342
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
get in the bowl.

08:01.477 --> 08:04.773
Dandelion greens,
a sprig of wildill,

08:04.787 --> 08:07.342
fresh blackberry
juice for dressing.

08:09.636 --> 08:11.233
It's delicious!

08:11.258 --> 08:13.793
Are you just saying that
'cause you're afraid of my dad?

08:13.796 --> 08:17.602
No, it's great!
Ooh!  Except for the bee!

08:20.208 --> 08:22.020
It's good
to see you laughing!

08:25.615 --> 08:28.351
You could make
a great chef someday.

08:29.225 --> 08:31.902
My dad wants me to go
into the family business.

08:31.987 --> 08:35.303
Which is, uh...
"waste management."

08:37.807 --> 08:39.703
We are going for a ride.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.731
By which I mean the carpool.

08:42.768 --> 08:44.592
Perhaps we will get yogurt.

08:45.648 --> 08:48.270
Now who wants to sleep
with the fishes?

08:49.026 --> 08:52.401
Because I broughtthis Finding Nemo bedspread.

08:58.916 --> 09:02.802
The Calabresis!
My archenemies in waste management!

09:11.128 --> 09:13.702
Milhouse, may I borrow
your three-ring binder?

09:14.808 --> 09:17.211
"Garfield" or "Love Is?"

09:18.348 --> 09:22.380
Uh, I prefer the cat. He hates Mondays.
We can all relate.

09:38.645 --> 09:39.730
Not that bad.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.953
Mom!

09:46.166 --> 09:48.661
I apologize for
my tardiness.

09:48.666 --> 09:51.762
I "ran into" some
old acquaintances.

09:51.817 --> 09:54.373
On the surface, that sounds
perfectly pleasant.

09:54.477 --> 09:57.111
Papa, can Lisa and her family
come over for dinner?

09:57.117 --> 09:58.903
We'd love to!

09:59.307 --> 10:01.153
You know,
I've never met your wife.

10:01.237 --> 10:05.700
Sadly, my Anna Maria was whacked
by natural causes.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.470
Oh, you're a widower.

10:08.503 --> 10:11.780
I bring flowers to her
grave every Sunday.

10:12.026 --> 10:16.908
Ooh, flowers every week!
I wish I was dead.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.142
Welcome to my home.

10:22.608 --> 10:24.762
Must have cost a fortune.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.650
Actually, you can really
keep costs down

10:27.658 --> 10:30.102
when you don't pay
for materials or labor...

10:30.106 --> 10:32.782
or permits...
or land.

10:33.408 --> 10:38.280
Your paintings have brush marks.
And your statues have wieners!

10:38.357 --> 10:40.750
Your words honor
my family.

10:40.916 --> 10:44.830
In the words of the old country:
Mangiare, i miei amici!

10:46.007 --> 10:48.031
He's talkin' like the guy
in Fat Albert.

10:48.037 --> 10:50.003
Howba areba youba?

10:50.005 --> 10:51.143
Homer!

10:52.307 --> 10:54.252
Whyba youba doba thatba?

10:57.205 --> 11:00.202
Boss, the Calabresis are
here for the sit-down.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.681
The sit-down's tonight?!

11:05.808 --> 11:09.062
Again this Palm Pilot
has failed to remind me.

11:09.066 --> 11:12.200
I believe this needs to be
hot-synced.

11:14.225 --> 11:15.262
What are you doing?

11:15.266 --> 11:18.650
I thought you meant "hot-sync" it.
You know how it is with us--

11:18.657 --> 11:20.352
everything means kill.

11:20.568 --> 11:23.000
Sit-down item number one:

11:23.008 --> 11:27.050
your recent murderous overtures
with regard to my person.

11:27.105 --> 11:29.303
We meant no disrespect,
Fat Tony.

11:29.388 --> 11:30.980
We were simply trying
to kill you.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.000
When  we saw you driving
that carpool,

11:33.005 --> 11:35.890
we figured you'd gone soft,
and were therefore whackable.

11:35.968 --> 11:40.310
You'd be fools to kill me for my son,
Michael, would take my place.

11:40.368 --> 11:43.402
And wreak a terrible vengeance.

11:43.466 --> 11:45.002
I made soufflés!

11:47.348 --> 11:51.503
I've tried to make those, but
they always end up as brownies.

11:51.935 --> 11:55.000
You said you meant
to make brownies.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.583
Any other lies?

11:58.937 --> 12:03.100
Oh, this must be
what angels taste like!

12:03.405 --> 12:04.581
Oh, Michael,

12:04.588 --> 12:09.533
One bite of this soufflé and your father
will realize your gift deserves to flower.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.362
Why can't you do anything?

12:17.227 --> 12:19.703
So, we are at peace once more.

12:19.706 --> 12:23.322
Let us indulge in exaggerated
displays of affection!

12:23.358 --> 12:26.232
This guy, I love him!
Get over here!

12:26.235 --> 12:27.863
My brother, over here!

12:27.885 --> 12:29.803
You're my everything,
over here!

12:29.805 --> 12:32.053
You color my world, over here!

12:32.188 --> 12:34.000
Over here, over here.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.152
Papa, I brought
you some dessert.

12:44.006 --> 12:47.603
My God, this is like
a lap dance for my taste buds!

12:47.667 --> 12:48.851
Ah, yeah!

12:48.856 --> 12:52.560
The flavor just drove my sweet tooth
to a vacant lot and whacked it.

12:52.568 --> 12:55.803
Hey, kid, what bakery
did you boost these from?

12:57.576 --> 12:59.740
Well, actually,
I made them.

13:00.797 --> 13:02.863
Papa, I want to be a chef.

13:05.305 --> 13:06.720
A chef, huh?

13:06.725 --> 13:09.730
Hey, look what we got here.
It's Chef Boy-ar-gay!

13:09.768 --> 13:12.760
What's he gonna do if we rub you out,
serve our soup cold?

13:14.796 --> 13:18.273
Well, gazpacho is served cold.
So take that.

13:22.506 --> 13:25.900
Hey, Tony, catch you later.
Your kid's got a bright future--

13:25.908 --> 13:27.863
catering your funeral.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.972
You know what I like?
Those little baby hot dogs.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.702
Do they small down big ones
or do they make 'em different?

13:40.558 --> 13:44.400
Michael, you have made me appear weak
in the eyes of my enemies.

13:44.406 --> 13:48.530
Fat Tony, it's not important
what other people think of you.

13:48.537 --> 13:52.070
What matters is how
you feel inside.

13:57.808 --> 13:58.800
Papa!

14:08.868 --> 14:12.292
Your father's gonna be absolutely fine
in about three months.

14:12.317 --> 14:15.001
But for now, he can't talk,
write or blink.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.582
With Fat Tony
doing the morphine mambo,

14:18.585 --> 14:21.173
the Calabresis are gonna try
to put him down for a dirt nap.

14:21.276 --> 14:23.922
Dirt nap, eh?
Hmm...

14:27.757 --> 14:31.331
Homer, our house is on fire!
Help me save the children!

14:31.337 --> 14:33.092
Sorry, Marge, can't hear you!

14:36.346 --> 14:38.603
What am I gonna do now?

14:38.608 --> 14:41.361
Kid, the only way you're
gonna live to grow shprazoot

14:41.367 --> 14:44.172
on your abonjoola is if
you take your dad's place.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.202
Let's go.

14:45.456 --> 14:49.163
Hey, can we go by the Lexus place?
I want to test drive that new hybrid.

14:49.255 --> 14:52.172
You are a hybrid:
half idiot, half moron.

14:52.276 --> 14:55.502
Whoa!
Where did that come from? Whoa!

14:55.765 --> 14:57.630
I don't know what to do.

14:57.667 --> 15:01.140
This is all my daughter's fault.
But I'll make it up to you.

15:01.145 --> 15:04.002
Bart and I will run your
business till your dad's okay.

15:04.228 --> 15:06.872
Well, what do you know
about being a mob boss?

15:06.908 --> 15:11.600
Everything! And I learned it all
from the greatest gangster film ever:

15:11.746 --> 15:13.343
Shark Tale.

15:14.277 --> 15:18.183
- This guy in here owes us money.
- Leave him to me.

15:19.745 --> 15:21.922
I hurt my fist and my palm.

15:21.936 --> 15:24.251
I  thought you guys
were looking out for me.

15:28.066 --> 15:32.383
All right, tap jockey, you owe Fat
Tony 50 bucks. Cough it up!

15:32.465 --> 15:35.280
Look,  Mister, I don't got
the cash. My clientele...

15:35.297 --> 15:37.173
They're all bums.
They never pay!

15:37.227 --> 15:40.001
Just get the money!

15:41.867 --> 15:45.043
Homer, the mob is putting
the screws on me, see.

15:45.046 --> 15:47.802
I ain't getting killed
'cause you won't pay your tab.

15:47.827 --> 15:49.660
Now give me 50 bucks!

15:49.705 --> 15:52.803
Take it, take it!
Just don't hurt me!

15:53.226 --> 15:57.162
Okay, pretty boy, where's
Fat Tony's 50 bucks?

15:57.227 --> 16:01.180
Look, all-all I got is 25.
I swear! I swear!

16:01.238 --> 16:03.373
It'll do for now!

16:12.405 --> 16:14.702
Hey, hey, it's Fat Tony's crew!

16:15.327 --> 16:17.203
How's the big guy doing?

16:17.305 --> 16:19.731
I sent flowers, but you
probably didn't get them.

16:19.735 --> 16:22.291
You know florists.
Glug, glug.

16:23.205 --> 16:26.480
Krusty, Fat Tony hasn't
received his weekly payment

16:26.487 --> 16:29.732
for keeping McDonald's
and Burger King out of town.

16:29.737 --> 16:31.693
Well, I'm a little short this week.

16:31.698 --> 16:34.613
Could I just pay you $5
to keep out Hardee's?

16:36.937 --> 16:42.301
Ow! My schnoz! My punim! My pupik!
My genechtagazoink!

16:46.477 --> 16:48.603
Homer, where'd you get
that truck?

16:49.306 --> 16:54.383
Uh, it-it fell off a truck.
Uh, you know, a truck-truck.

16:57.566 --> 16:58.920
Where'd you get that?

16:58.996 --> 17:01.800
Eh, it fell off
a truck-truck truck.

17:09.137 --> 17:13.800
Homer, Helen Lovejoy never returned my
casserole dish from the church potluck.

17:13.805 --> 17:14.901
Could you pick it up?

17:14.907 --> 17:17.271
No problem.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

17:18.536 --> 17:20.440
Hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!

17:26.626 --> 17:27.859
I, uh...

17:28.006 --> 17:31.000
I got your, uh, phone bill
in my mail by mistake,

17:31.007 --> 17:34.502
and, uh...
I-I'll just pay it.

17:39.505 --> 17:41.402
Dad, you want I should
plug him in the ankle?

17:41.408 --> 17:45.001
You monster! Just cut his Achilles
tendon with this knife.

17:58.155 --> 18:02.642
Bart, Mr. Simpson, we are getting out of
the mob business, right now.

18:02.655 --> 18:04.810
But this is the only life I know!

18:04.815 --> 18:08.121
I'm sorry. I just can't live with
myself, seeing you this way.

18:08.147 --> 18:11.290
- Can I still talk wh my hands?
- I'm afraid not.

18:11.305 --> 18:13.352
- What about with my ears?
- No.

18:16.485 --> 18:18.681
My friends, I surrender.

18:18.827 --> 18:21.153
I'm handing over
all my father's territory,

18:21.268 --> 18:24.550
in exchange for the safety
of my family and the Simpsons.

18:24.648 --> 18:27.791
Sorry. We can only guarantee
we won't hurt them.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.703
Yeah. You know, they've still got
to eat right and exercise.

18:30.908 --> 18:34.653
Walk the dog once in a while.
He's a furry little fitness machine.

18:34.668 --> 18:36.590
Well said.
As for me,

18:36.597 --> 18:39.803
from now on, my only
business is cooking.

18:43.065 --> 18:47.300
You did the right thing, Mikey.
You weren't cut out to be a wise guy.

18:47.475 --> 18:51.800
But you, you got a future
in this business. Call me.

18:51.908 --> 18:54.712
Thanks, but I'm going
into bootleg DVDs.

18:58.206 --> 19:00.850
It's so great that Michael's
doing what he loves.

19:00.918 --> 19:04.421
And I can stop looking the other way
from what my husband's doing.

19:04.516 --> 19:06.170
Lady.
Man.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.603
Lady.
Man.

19:09.076 --> 19:10.901
Lady.

19:21.167 --> 19:25.470
I want to be buried next to my wife,
under that bridge in Jersey.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.471
Someone poisoned these meatballs.
Homer?

19:31.578 --> 19:34.303
Hey, if I poisoned them,
would I be doing this?

19:40.006 --> 19:42.800
This is a chef's worst nightmare.

19:42.855 --> 19:45.500
I won't be using this recipe anymore.

19:55.925 --> 19:58.043
Well done, my son.

19:58.278 --> 20:02.550
In making peace with our enemies,
you were able to take them down.

20:02.667 --> 20:06.301
Perhaps you and I are not
so different after all.

20:06.307 --> 20:09.801
Papa, I'm just glad you're okay.
Now get some rest.

20:11.918 --> 20:14.420
Why don't you tell him
it was an accident?

20:15.095 --> 20:17.822
It was an accident, right?
Michael?

20:18.116 --> 20:21.502
Don't ever ask me
out my business, Lisa.

20:22.216 --> 20:23.402
Michael?

20:24.305 --> 20:30.541
