WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.859
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:12.634 --> 00:15.364
-Hi,you guys!
- Hey!

00:16.104 --> 00:19.562
Yourfriend... Celia called to tell you...

00:19.641 --> 00:22.166
- Sammy?
- It's OK. It's only an escalator.

00:22.310 --> 00:24.369
Kristen called you from the Bahamas.

00:24.446 --> 00:29.645
And also, Elaine... Lieberman
will be at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

00:29.751 --> 00:33.551
- Great.
- Thank you so much for watching Sammy.

00:33.622 --> 00:36.113
Really, you saved my life.

00:36.191 --> 00:38.455
- Was he any trouble?
- No. Not at all.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.925
Good.

00:40.395 --> 00:42.727
So, everything worked out great.

00:42.797 --> 00:46.426
I was sure you'd either show up
three hours late or not at all.

00:46.601 --> 00:50.537
- I'm not like every other man you know.
- I realize that. I was kidding.

00:50.605 --> 00:52.573
No, you weren't but...

00:52.874 --> 00:55.434
I'm not like every other woman you know.

00:55.544 --> 00:58.035
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:58.146 --> 01:02.173
You probably think I'm a real control freak.
And I'm not, at all.

01:02.284 --> 01:06.186
Well, I mean, I do like things
the way I like them, but who doesn't?

01:06.288 --> 01:11.385
And, anyway, in my life I'm the only one who
ever does anything so... what does it matter?

01:11.459 --> 01:15.361
Maybe you should let somebody
help you out every once in a while.

01:15.430 --> 01:18.228
Definitely not. I've got
all these balls up in the air.

01:18.366 --> 01:21.893
If somebody else caught one
for me, I'd drop them all.

01:22.003 --> 01:25.564
- But you're not a control freak?
- No. I'm a single, working mother.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.006
OK. I have more work to do than time to do it.

01:28.076 --> 01:33.844
So before we get into yet another lengthy
and exhausting thing, I have a career to save.

01:33.915 --> 01:38.443
- Do you have any instructions for me?
- No, no. I trust you completely.

01:39.321 --> 01:44.725
I don't suppose you could
switch your thing from 5 to 4:30?

01:44.826 --> 01:47.693
I just found out that
I have a new thing at 5:30.

01:47.796 --> 01:50.424
- I can't switch.
- I'll switch mine. No problem.

01:50.599 --> 01:54.126
- OK. I'll see you guys at the soccer game.
- Bye, Jack!

01:54.936 --> 01:58.133
- Thanks again, Jack.
- You're welcome.

02:00.709 --> 02:06.113
I realize it's difficult,
what with Celia, Kristen, Elaine...

02:06.715 --> 02:09.205
I know your name, Mel.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.891 --> 02:52.121
So what'd you guys do with Jack?

02:52.193 --> 02:56.129
Quit kicking me, Maggie.
I wasn't gonna say anything about...

02:56.197 --> 02:58.062
About what?

02:59.301 --> 03:01.895
It's a secret. We're not supposed to say.

03:01.970 --> 03:04.131
Secret about what?

03:04.205 --> 03:07.140
- About your dad?
- And you too, Mommy.

03:07.208 --> 03:09.768
Me too?

03:09.878 --> 03:12.278
Come on, you guys. Tell.

03:14.983 --> 03:17.110
A secret about me and Jack.

03:19.521 --> 03:22.547
Does it have anything to do with feelings?

03:23.224 --> 03:25.351
- What do you mean?
- You know. Feelings.

03:25.493 --> 03:29.827
Like being scared or hurt or...
or happy and excited.

03:31.399 --> 03:35.096
- Those are all feelings.
- Definitely about feelings, then.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.764
Yeah. Definitely.

03:40.008 --> 03:42.306
Switch.

03:45.847 --> 03:48.213
- Sorry, Mom.
- It's OK, honey.

03:53.922 --> 03:56.948
- So what'd you get?
- Frozen hot chocolate.

03:59.127 --> 04:01.425
- You like chocolate?
- I love chocolate.

04:01.563 --> 04:05.624
Daddy told Dr Martin that he's got
deep, dark chocolate inside of him.

04:05.867 --> 04:07.630
Really?

04:07.736 --> 04:13.038
And that he'd like to meet a fish who
wasn't afraid of his dark-chocolate layer.

04:13.141 --> 04:15.837
I think I'm beginning to guess the secret.

04:15.944 --> 04:18.640
- Are you mad?
- Not really.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.340
- He should have talked about it with me.
- He was afraid you'd hate him.

04:23.418 --> 04:25.545
Of course I wouldn't hate him.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.679
Honestly, that is so silly.

04:30.425 --> 04:33.292
You don't understand. This is an emergency.

04:33.395 --> 04:37.024
I don't interrupt Mrs Lieberman
during her bikini wax.

04:37.098 --> 04:40.465
- Now listen.
- Don't bother with the cute face.

04:40.602 --> 04:45.471
I have five sons. You make eyes at me
like that, I make you pot roast.

04:45.607 --> 04:48.974
Excuse me. Hello, Mrs Kempner.
Let me get your robe.

04:54.215 --> 04:56.615
- Goodbye, Mrs Lieberman.
- Next week.

04:56.684 --> 04:58.777
Down, please.

05:12.634 --> 05:15.194
Is Mrs Lieberman here? No? OK.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.795
- Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.804
Hey, is Mrs Elaine Lieberman
in here, by any chance?

05:22.877 --> 05:25.277
It's OK. Sorry.

05:26.214 --> 05:29.274
- Hi. I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman.
- She just left.

05:29.350 --> 05:32.285
- Thank you.
- Jack! Is that you?

05:32.353 --> 05:34.878
- Yeah.
- It's Rita.

05:35.723 --> 05:38.089
Melanie's mother.

05:38.159 --> 05:40.150
- Rita. Hey.
- Sorry.

05:40.261 --> 05:44.288
- What a small world.
- I spent the afternoon with your grandson.

05:44.365 --> 05:47.493
- He's cute, but a handful.
- I need to find Elaine Lieberman.

05:47.569 --> 05:51.300
I wanna tell you one thing about Melanie.
Something you may suspect.

05:51.372 --> 05:55.536
She can make you scream like you're having
a body wax. She's that frustrating.

05:55.677 --> 05:58.145
Inside, Jack, she's mush.

05:58.713 --> 06:01.147
- Mush?
- So you scream all you want.

06:01.249 --> 06:05.117
- But just don't run away too soon.
- OK. All right. Bye.

06:05.186 --> 06:07.279
Bye-bye. You're adorable.

06:10.859 --> 06:12.918
- Mrs Lieberman?
- Right there.

06:12.994 --> 06:16.191
Hey, Mrs Lieberman! Mrs Lieberman!

06:16.297 --> 06:18.925
Mrs Lieberman! Jack Taylor! Daily News!

06:20.768 --> 06:23.362
- Get in.
- All right!

06:25.907 --> 06:28.375
I'm glad I finally found you.

06:28.476 --> 06:31.809
- I have to ask you a difficult question.
- About my husband.

06:31.913 --> 06:37.476
- Do you know about his business affairs?
- Are you referring to the illegal account?

06:37.552 --> 06:40.020
- So you know about that?
- It's in his name.

06:40.121 --> 06:42.919
- Yeah.
- I have the deposit slips.

06:43.992 --> 06:46.324
- I don't suppose you'd...
- Go on the record?

06:46.394 --> 06:50.330
- I know it's a lot to ask.
- Elaine Lieberman. E-L-A-I-N-E

06:50.398 --> 06:53.231
L-I-E-B-E-R-M-A-N.

06:53.334 --> 06:56.235
- I only have one request.
- Anything at all.

06:56.337 --> 06:59.431
- Fax him a copy in Barbados.
- All right.

07:02.744 --> 07:04.837
- Hello.
- Hi, darling.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.506
Mom. Thank God. I'm in big trouble.

07:07.582 --> 07:13.543
I have to have drinks with clients at 5:30
or I'll be fired. I have absolutely no childcare.

07:13.621 --> 07:18.115
When are you done at Elizabeth Arden's?
Sammy! Put that down! You'll break it.

07:18.192 --> 07:21.161
You only think about work.
What about your personal life?

07:21.229 --> 07:27.793
Actually, Mom, today I thought a lot
about my personal life. Don't laugh. I did.

07:27.869 --> 07:29.632
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.969
Kitty?

07:37.045 --> 07:39.275
Kitty! Kitty?

07:39.581 --> 07:42.675
What do you mean, don't be
my usual self with him?

07:42.817 --> 07:45.081
My usual self can't be all that bad

07:45.186 --> 07:48.849
since I'm pretty sure Jack told
the kids he has feelings for me.

07:49.390 --> 07:52.086
- He wants to ask me out on a date.
- Divine.

07:52.193 --> 07:54.423
Maggie? Sammy, where's Maggie?

07:54.495 --> 07:58.022
Take that out of your nose.
What is the matter with you?

07:59.033 --> 08:01.501
Excuse me. And the thing is, I'm...

08:02.103 --> 08:04.571
I think I could have feelings for him too.

08:04.639 --> 08:08.871
Or at least I think I might be able to,
which is... it's a big step up for me.

08:08.977 --> 08:10.604
Mom, could you hold on?

08:10.678 --> 08:12.077
Maggie?

08:12.180 --> 08:17.516
Well, I had no idea from that floating head
on top of his column that he was so tall.

08:17.619 --> 08:21.919
And he's got good color in his skin,
which you also couldn't tell from the photo.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.287
He really is altogether yummy, Mel.

08:24.392 --> 08:27.793
- How would you know?
- Because he was just here, darling.

08:28.096 --> 08:32.395
This isn't some horrifyingly elaborate
matchmaking scheme, is it? Maggie!

08:32.900 --> 08:35.299
- Of course not, darling.
- Maggie!

08:36.004 --> 08:40.236
- Oh my God. I just lost his daughter!
- You lost his daughter?

08:42.243 --> 08:44.302
Maggie!

08:46.014 --> 08:48.209
Maggie! Oh my God.

08:48.883 --> 08:51.113
Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl?

08:51.419 --> 08:55.287
Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl?
She's about six years old.

08:55.356 --> 08:57.722
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a little girl?

08:57.925 --> 09:01.053
Excuse me! Have you seen
a little girl about six?

09:01.496 --> 09:03.828
Maggie!

09:07.468 --> 09:09.732
Have you seen a little girl about six?

09:13.307 --> 09:15.935
Excuse me! Have you seen...

09:18.546 --> 09:20.639
Maggie!

09:23.317 --> 09:25.114
Maggie!

09:30.124 --> 09:32.183
Maggie!

09:50.178 --> 09:52.373
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.678
- Anything else you can tell us, Miss Parker?
- I don't think so. I just...

09:56.751 --> 10:00.710
He's still not answering. I can't believe it.
One minute she was there...

10:00.788 --> 10:04.986
- I understand but...
- You don't. I just met this guy this morning.

10:05.093 --> 10:07.152
And I was horrible to him all day!

10:07.228 --> 10:09.423
- Excuse me.
- You're shivering. Jimmy...

10:09.530 --> 10:14.900
Why was I so horrible to him! I called him
immature and uncharming and irresponsible!

10:15.002 --> 10:17.732
- I was my usual self, she said.
- I need to find my purse.

10:17.805 --> 10:21.104
Excuse me, but I've lost a little girl!
I'm sorry.

10:21.175 --> 10:25.134
She said "Don't be your usual self"
and I was my usual self!

10:25.213 --> 10:29.843
And he took perfect care of my son while
I did my presentation, which went very well!

10:29.984 --> 10:32.976
And then I lost his daughter!
How could I have done that?

10:33.054 --> 10:38.014
- It probably wasn't your fault.
- I didn't even pay my bill from Serendipity!

10:38.359 --> 10:40.418
Is that your mom?

10:46.934 --> 10:50.836
Mrs Lieberman... Elaine...
You have saved my life.

10:51.873 --> 10:53.966
Watch your head.

10:59.747 --> 11:01.806
That was smart.

11:03.951 --> 11:05.612
- Jack.
- Mike.

11:07.355 --> 11:09.346
I love you, Lew.

11:09.423 --> 11:13.587
I love this town. I love this job.
I love Elaine Lieberman.

11:13.661 --> 11:18.189
- That's a lot of love for you, Jack.
- I gotta tell you. I met someone today.

11:18.266 --> 11:22.498
- What are you talkin' about?
- I don't know how to describe her.

11:22.603 --> 11:25.470
She's luminous. Her face is...

11:26.207 --> 11:28.402
- You're talkin' about women.
- Yeah.

11:28.476 --> 11:31.070
Your ass is on the line. Are you nuts?

11:31.179 --> 11:34.774
That is under control. I have
Elaine Lieberman on the record.

11:34.849 --> 11:37.249
And she has proof of a campaign account.

11:37.318 --> 11:42.915
She's an angry wife. Her husband just sends
her a sorry-gram and she's off the record!

11:43.024 --> 11:46.323
- You have my word.
- Your word means nothing to management.

11:46.427 --> 11:49.863
Make sure Elaine Lieberman
gets to that press conference.

11:49.931 --> 11:53.389
Either she confronts the mayor
or I have to print a retraction.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.526
Don't worry. Elaine's my girl.

11:55.636 --> 11:57.729
I hope so, Jack.

11:57.839 --> 12:00.433
Jack? I just had lunch with Frank Burroughs.

12:00.508 --> 12:04.604
Very bright. Very funny. Very humble man.

12:04.679 --> 12:07.011
- You love me, Lew. You know you do.
- Yeah.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.514
Come on, Lois. Come on. Go ahead. That's it.

12:11.619 --> 12:13.678
Hey, Lew? Lew!

12:13.754 --> 12:16.245
- Where's Jack?
- On the way to city hall.

12:16.324 --> 12:18.554
But I have urgent messages for him.

12:21.062 --> 12:24.225
I can't sit here like this.
I gotta go find Jack.

12:27.268 --> 12:31.136
He's gonna be at city hall
in 15 minutes. Come on, honey.

12:36.043 --> 12:38.068
Uh-huh. Five o'clock. That's great.

12:38.179 --> 12:39.373
Hang on!

12:39.480 --> 12:41.539
Elaine, excuse me one second.

12:41.649 --> 12:43.549
City hall, please.

12:43.651 --> 12:48.452
- Look, I can't thank you enough.
- Duane! Please. City hall.

12:48.522 --> 12:54.051
I'll do my best to get there. I was on my way
to Staten Island so I might be a little late.

12:54.161 --> 12:55.685
All right? Bye.

12:55.763 --> 12:56.991
Duane! Hurry up.

13:04.739 --> 13:07.970
- Hello.
- Mr Taylor? Lt Bonomo, 18th Precinct.

13:08.075 --> 13:10.168
We found your daughter.

13:11.279 --> 13:12.075
What?

13:21.522 --> 13:25.219
- Excuse me. Have you seen Jack Taylor?
- No, I haven't.

13:26.494 --> 13:30.521
Excuse me. You don't happen
to know Jack Taylor, do you?

13:30.598 --> 13:34.625
- Very well, in fact.
- You're... Celia, aren't you?

13:34.735 --> 13:38.796
Yes. And you must be the one
who lost his little girl.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.939
- Hello! Maggie!
- Daddy!

13:44.011 --> 13:45.569
- Hey! Hi.
- Hello.

13:45.646 --> 13:49.343
Hey, I'm Jack Taylor. That's mine.
Thank you very much for watching her.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.908
- It was my pleasure.
- I'm sure it was.

13:52.753 --> 13:55.017
- Come on.
- I wanna play with the kitties.

13:55.122 --> 14:00.856
I gotta go to a press conference. Hi, kitties.
Come on. Tag - you're it! Chase me. Let's go.

14:00.962 --> 14:04.523
- No. I wanna play with the kitties.
- Come on. Red light, green light.

14:04.598 --> 14:08.056
- Stop it!
- Let's go. Maggie, don't do this right now.

14:08.169 --> 14:11.161
Don't you understand? If I don't get there...

14:11.272 --> 14:15.470
- No, Daddy, no! Stop it!
- Do you want me to lose my job?

14:28.189 --> 14:31.681
- You really love those kittens, right?
- Yeah.

14:33.894 --> 14:36.863
OK. Come on. Come here.
Watch your head. There.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.659
OK.

14:41.769 --> 14:43.703
What are their names?

14:43.804 --> 14:46.705
This one's Bob cos he looks like a bobcat.

14:47.842 --> 14:51.300
And that one's Fred, and that one's...

14:51.412 --> 14:53.471
I forget this one's name.

14:56.050 --> 15:00.248
OK. Listen, Maggie. I know that
this has been a rotten day for you,

15:00.388 --> 15:03.653
and I know all you wanna do
is play with these kittens.

15:03.724 --> 15:06.386
I don't blame you cos they're great.

15:07.094 --> 15:12.464
But if I don't get to this press conference, I'll
lose my job. And I don't wanna lose my job.

15:12.533 --> 15:16.526
So we gotta work somethin' out.
We gotta make some kind of a deal here.

15:16.637 --> 15:20.835
So... what if we talk
to this beautiful young lady

15:20.908 --> 15:25.106
and we ask her if maybe Bob can come
to the press conference with us?

15:25.212 --> 15:27.874
You mean keep him?

15:27.948 --> 15:31.076
- Borrow him.
- But I wanna keep him.

15:32.353 --> 15:35.948
- You'll have to ask your mother about that.
- She's allergic.

15:36.057 --> 15:38.548
Oh, that's right. She gets all...

15:41.062 --> 15:44.031
All right. You know what?

15:44.098 --> 15:46.157
Bob can just stay at my house.

15:46.634 --> 15:48.898
Where would he sleep?

15:48.969 --> 15:53.565
You know that room with all the boxes in it?
We could clear it out. He could sleep there.

15:53.674 --> 15:55.733
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

15:55.843 --> 16:00.644
Of course you're gonna have to come over
and visit every once in a while to check up.

16:00.714 --> 16:04.115
Make sure I'm feedin' him and everything.

16:04.185 --> 16:06.710
- I will.
- Yeah?

16:07.655 --> 16:09.919
Come here.

16:15.463 --> 16:18.762
You know, maybe what we oughta do

16:19.934 --> 16:22.562
is put a bed in that room for you too.

16:24.605 --> 16:26.732
Yeah.

16:26.807 --> 16:29.537
- Cos he might get lonely.
- Yeah.

16:30.344 --> 16:33.211
But he's not gonna get lonely with you there.

16:36.350 --> 16:38.682
Let me take a look at this guy.

16:38.752 --> 16:40.982
So this is gonna be our cat, huh?

16:41.088 --> 16:43.147
- Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

16:45.192 --> 16:47.990
Now can we get outta here already?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.082
Mr Mayor! Mr Mayor!

16:54.791 --> 16:56.224
Mr Burroughs?

16:56.326 --> 16:59.227
Do you plan to sue
Jack Taylor and the Daily News

16:59.329 --> 17:03.993
for the apparently false, unsubstantiated
charges they've made against you?

17:04.101 --> 17:06.330
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

17:10.607 --> 17:14.008
- Hey, Dad. That guy's on the bus too.
- Hurry, please.

17:14.111 --> 17:16.772
- His picture's bigger than yours.
- You speak English?

17:16.980 --> 17:19.972
Last question, please.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.576
Excuse me! Excuse me.

17:22.653 --> 17:25.247
Last question, please.

17:27.991 --> 17:31.256
- Mom, you're not a reporter.
- I gotta do something.

17:31.361 --> 17:33.386
- Mr Mayor!
- Mr Mayor!

17:33.530 --> 17:35.555
- What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

17:35.866 --> 17:37.925
- Mr Mayor!
- Yes?

17:38.869 --> 17:41.565
- You, on the right.
- I...

17:41.638 --> 17:44.607
- What about Elaine...
- Lieberman.

17:44.942 --> 17:46.807
- Lieberman!
- What about her?

17:46.877 --> 17:50.574
She's my sanitation commissioner's wife.
She has nothing to do with this.

17:50.647 --> 17:53.275
What paper are you with, young lady?

17:53.383 --> 17:58.685
I believe Mrs Lieberman has spoken to Jack
Taylor and can back up everything he said.

17:58.789 --> 18:02.657
Jack Taylor is a reckless man
with a gift for manipulating the truth.

18:02.759 --> 18:04.886
I... I know Jack Taylor, sir,

18:04.995 --> 18:09.557
and... and... and... and he is
pretty cocky most of the time

18:09.633 --> 18:14.400
and he does seem to have somewhat of
a cavalier attitude, but at least he's honest.

18:14.471 --> 18:18.066
I don't know what relationship
you have with Mr Taylor,

18:18.175 --> 18:22.111
but you clearly know nothing
about politics or journalism.

18:22.212 --> 18:25.204
That's it. No more questions. Thank you.

18:30.053 --> 18:31.816
Melanie!

18:31.888 --> 18:36.621
Look, Melanie. I got a kitty!
His name's Bob and Dad said I can keep him!

18:36.693 --> 18:39.685
- Mr Mayor?
- Jack, Elaine Lieberman didn't show up.

18:39.796 --> 18:42.856
- I know that. Mr Mayor!
- No, no, no, Mr Taylor.

18:42.933 --> 18:44.901
The press conference is over.

18:45.002 --> 18:48.529
Mr Mayor, you may be able
to strong-arm Manny Feldstein

18:48.672 --> 18:53.700
and to buffalo my paper into printing
a retraction, and they may actually fire me.

18:53.810 --> 18:58.042
- But we both know this garbage thing stinks.
- Pitiful, Mr Taylor.

18:58.115 --> 19:02.108
You and your little friend in the outfit.
Just pitiful!

19:02.219 --> 19:05.655
What is pitiful, Mr Mayor, is that
if I had a few minutes more,

19:05.722 --> 19:10.523
Elaine Lieberman would be here
with a canceled check for $250,000,

19:10.660 --> 19:12.924
from a very well-known Mob front,

19:13.030 --> 19:15.555
made out to your reelection campaign.

19:15.699 --> 19:20.534
That's a blatant fabrication! We both know
that no such canceled check exists!

19:20.670 --> 19:24.470
You know, you're right. I'm confused.
There would be no check.

19:24.541 --> 19:28.033
But there would be a deposit slip.
Wouldn't there, Elaine?

19:28.111 --> 19:31.342
- Come here. Hi. Can I have that, please?
- Hello, Sidney.

19:31.448 --> 19:38.377
All right. This is dated March 15 of this year.
It is a deposit slip for $250,000.

19:38.488 --> 19:44.723
That same day a deposit was made
into your campaign account for $250,000.

19:44.795 --> 19:47.787
But I guess that was just a coincidence.

19:47.898 --> 19:50.992
The press conference is over! I said over!

19:51.101 --> 19:53.092
How'd you discover the account?

19:53.170 --> 19:56.697
- Elaine, what can I say?
- Jack, it was my pleasure.

19:56.773 --> 19:59.970
- Can I see that document?
- In the paper tomorrow, Frank.

20:00.077 --> 20:02.477
You guys wanna go
to the soccer game? Come on.

20:02.546 --> 20:06.812
- All right. My public. Who first?
- Does your husband know you've done this?

20:06.917 --> 20:10.580
My husband. Funny you bring that up.
He's in Barbados. B-A-R-B-A-D...

20:10.954 --> 20:13.218
That was an excellent moment in my life.

20:13.323 --> 20:14.881
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.620
- Can we go to the soccer game now?
- Yes, sweetheart.

20:17.761 --> 20:21.128
- Yeah, boy. Come here.
- I really am so sorry about Maggie.

20:21.198 --> 20:24.827
- I don't wanna think what could've happened.
- Me neither.

20:24.935 --> 20:30.339
I can't believe I was issued shellfish
and dander warnings. Sandbox alerts.

20:30.407 --> 20:33.376
You laughed in my face
when I came to your office on time.

20:33.443 --> 20:35.968
- I know.
- And then you lost my daughter.

20:36.046 --> 20:38.378
It was the worst thing I could've done.

20:38.448 --> 20:42.179
- I really am so sorry.
- So someone else is the irresponsible one.

20:42.252 --> 20:46.188
- Yes, they are.
- I'd like to hear you say that for your kind.

20:46.256 --> 20:49.521
- My kind?
- The ones with all the balls in the air.

20:49.593 --> 20:52.824
- It's the least you could do.
- Of course I'll say it, Jack.

20:52.929 --> 20:55.921
I was the irresponsible one. Taxi!

20:55.999 --> 20:59.025
- Now say "I can't do everything on my own."
- Why?

20:59.136 --> 21:03.072
Because with one sentence
you can restore my faith in women again.

21:03.173 --> 21:05.869
- Of course I'll say it for you, Jack.
- OK.

21:06.576 --> 21:09.170
- We'll never get a cab.
- You can't say it.

21:09.246 --> 21:13.182
- Sure I can, but it won't be true.
- I'm waitin'.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.680
- OK. I can't do everything alone.
- There. Great.

21:16.820 --> 21:20.415
Even though my daily activities
year after year contradict that.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.458
Unbelievable!

21:22.559 --> 21:25.585
- You made me grovel for no reason.
- For a great reason.

21:25.662 --> 21:28.096
You are an arrogant ball-juggler, baby.

21:28.198 --> 21:30.962
First of all, don't call me "baby."

21:31.034 --> 21:34.470
If you don't want your balls juggled,
don't throw them in my face.

21:34.571 --> 21:39.031
- I never threw them in your face.
- You thrust your stupid column at me

21:39.109 --> 21:42.169
as a lame excuse for my son
missing his field trip.

21:42.245 --> 21:44.839
Balls in my face.

21:44.915 --> 21:48.851
Big Jack Reporter can't possibly
concentrate on mundane details like

21:48.919 --> 21:54.482
phoning to say "Thanks, but I won't need
you to take my daughter to school today."

21:54.591 --> 21:59.051
And then you have to ask who I assume
is one of your many girlfriends

21:59.129 --> 22:03.896
if she's wearing her panties,
as loud as you can! Balls in my face!

22:04.000 --> 22:08.300
And now, in the midst of
my obvious remorse, you make me grovel?

22:08.405 --> 22:11.431
First of all, I thrust my column in your face

22:11.508 --> 22:18.072
because I thought you were the most
beautiful woman that I have ever seen, and I...

22:21.284 --> 22:24.082
I wanted to make a good impression.

22:27.657 --> 22:31.354
I forgot to call you this morning
because I, as opposed to you,

22:31.461 --> 22:34.430
am not used to doing everything on my own.

22:34.497 --> 22:41.096
As for the panties, that remark was directed
to my editor Lew simply to piss you off.

22:44.274 --> 22:47.243
Come on, Dad. I've got a taxi. Can we go?

22:50.247 --> 22:53.148
Hey. Look who got the cab.

22:57.787 --> 23:01.689
- I think my dad likes your mom.
- Maybe my mom likes him back.

23:01.758 --> 23:04.124
Men like you have made me the woman I am.

23:04.194 --> 23:09.097
All the women I know like you
make me think all women are like you.

23:09.165 --> 23:13.363
Oh my God. I almost forgot.
I've got a meeting. Drinks with clients.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.938
It's 5:25. You're never gonna make it.

23:16.006 --> 23:20.739
Mom! It's the last game of the season.
It's for the championships, Mom.

23:20.810 --> 23:24.541
The coach said every kid has to play
or they don't get a trophy.

23:24.614 --> 23:28.607
Even the losers get one.
But you don't get a trophy if you don't play.

23:28.718 --> 23:32.154
- I know, but it's on the way. We'll make it.
- Let go of it.

23:32.522 --> 23:35.548
I can't let go of it. It's my job.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.718
Hold this.

23:38.395 --> 23:42.354
Could we go to the 21 Club instead?
21 West 52nd Street.

23:42.432 --> 23:46.698
And don't try to take 14th
or 32nd or 44th across.

23:46.770 --> 23:49.603
You can't make a left at this hour.

23:51.775 --> 23:53.834
I know I can do this.

23:55.045 --> 23:59.345
- No, don't take Broadway. Try Sixth Avenue.
-  Great green gobs of...

23:59.416 --> 24:03.113
-  Greasy, grimy gopher guts
- But after 23rd because of the construction.

24:03.186 --> 24:06.349
-  French-fried eyeballs floatin' in a bowl of...
-  Snot

24:06.423 --> 24:08.516
Snot.

24:39.989 --> 24:42.082
Here we go.

24:43.293 --> 24:47.821
Why don't you hold the cab? If I'm not back
in 15 minutes, go on ahead without me.

24:47.897 --> 24:51.060
- You'll take longer than 15 minutes.
- I can do this.

24:51.167 --> 24:53.397
OK, baby.

24:53.470 --> 24:56.633
Mommy, what if you don't come
and Daddy doesn't come?

24:56.706 --> 25:01.666
Oh, sweetheart, I'm going to be there. You are
the most important thing to me in the world.

25:01.911 --> 25:05.438
- Your job is.
- No. You are.

25:06.116 --> 25:08.482
But I have to do this now.

25:08.585 --> 25:13.249
Sammy, I know I've dragged you places and
left you and I've been a crazy person today.

25:13.323 --> 25:18.454
But it's going to be better tomorrow. And
I promise I won't take longer than 15 minutes.

25:18.528 --> 25:20.621
OK? Huh?

25:25.001 --> 25:26.798
Hey, Sammy, come here.

25:26.870 --> 25:31.307
Don't worry. She'll make it.
Let's get ready for soccer. Grab me that bag.

25:35.712 --> 25:38.044
- Hello. How are you?
- I see my party.

25:40.884 --> 25:43.444
I'm glad you could make it.
What's your poison?

25:43.520 --> 25:46.148
- I'll just have some water.
- Nonsense.

25:46.256 --> 25:48.315
You have some catching up to do.

25:49.359 --> 25:53.318
She'll have a dry vodka martini, straight up.

25:57.066 --> 26:00.502
Hey. What are you thinkin' about, kiddo?

26:01.037 --> 26:04.063
I hope my daddy can come
to our soccer game.

26:04.174 --> 26:06.267
Yeah.

26:07.710 --> 26:10.440
Mommy hopes he can come too.

26:10.513 --> 26:12.447
Last night...

26:12.515 --> 26:16.713
Last night my mom thought I was asleep
but I really wasn't.

26:16.786 --> 26:22.520
And I heard her say over and over: "Please
let Eddie come. Please let Eddie come."

26:25.261 --> 26:28.196
- Eddie? Who's Eddie?
- Eddie's my dad.

26:29.999 --> 26:32.092
I hope he comes too, kiddo.

26:33.670 --> 26:38.073
We were just discussing plans for
an upscale amusement complex for adults.

26:38.141 --> 26:41.668
- You know. With food and games and rides.
- No rides, Dad.

26:41.744 --> 26:44.542
After drinks, we wanted
to take a drive to Stamford.

26:44.614 --> 26:48.812
We were hoping to take a look at
a bad version of what we have in mind.

26:48.918 --> 26:54.823
Before we head out, Melanie, maybe you'd
toss out a few ideas off the top of your head.

26:57.293 --> 26:59.784
Well...

27:00.230 --> 27:04.530
Adult amusement complexes, up until now,
have been somewhat cheesy.

27:04.601 --> 27:08.298
Usually attached to
popular video stores and...

27:09.305 --> 27:13.435
What I'm thinking of is
something a bit more exciting.

27:14.644 --> 27:18.011
A drawing might help. Don't you think?

27:18.114 --> 27:20.582
- I...
- I love drawings.

27:20.650 --> 27:23.312
I don't have a...

27:24.053 --> 27:26.146
OK.

27:28.858 --> 27:31.793
Let's see. Something like...

27:44.007 --> 27:48.205
Isn't that the little lost boy
from this morning?

27:49.479 --> 27:51.276
With... You know...

28:10.600 --> 28:14.195
You know... I can't do this now.

28:15.972 --> 28:18.907
And I can't go with you
to Stamford now either.

28:20.243 --> 28:26.478
Yes, Mr Leland, that is the little lost boy from
this morning. Only he's not lost. He's my son.

28:27.116 --> 28:30.847
I have a child and he has
a soccer game in 20 minutes.

28:30.920 --> 28:36.017
If he's late, he won't get the trophy. And since
I'm in here with you, he'll probably be late.

28:36.092 --> 28:39.061
But what gets to me the most is,
instead of crying about it,

28:39.128 --> 28:44.031
he's out there with a big old smile
blowing fish faces at us.

28:47.070 --> 28:51.871
Gentlemen, if you're smart, you will want me
as much for my dedication and ability

28:51.941 --> 28:56.435
as for the fact that I am going to ditch you
right now and run like hell across town

28:56.512 --> 28:59.606
so that my kid knows that
what matters to me most is him.

28:59.682 --> 29:05.712
And, Mr Leland, your real grounds for firing
me should be if I were to stay here with you.

29:09.726 --> 29:12.251
- I like her.
- A lot.

29:15.665 --> 29:20.932
Well, I probably lost my job! But at least
we still have ten minutes to get to the game!

29:21.037 --> 29:22.698
Hey, shortcut!

29:22.772 --> 29:28.108
In spite of everything, Jack, I do
sincerely apologize for losing Maggie.

29:28.177 --> 29:30.702
That's OK. It happened to me this morning.

29:30.780 --> 29:34.944
- You lost Maggie this morning?
- Yeah. She wandered off after the office cat.

29:35.051 --> 29:38.782
It might have been helpful if you had
mentioned her tendency to wander.

29:38.888 --> 29:42.051
Yeah, well, it might have been helpful...
Here we go. Up here!

29:42.125 --> 29:47.461
..if you had mentioned Sammy's tendency
to stick things up his nose!

29:47.530 --> 29:50.055
- He didn't!
- Oh, yeah! Way up there!

29:50.133 --> 29:52.465
The doctor had to use this plier-type thing.

29:52.535 --> 29:57.598
It's called an alligator.
A tool I have come to know well.

29:57.707 --> 30:00.301
- OK!
- Hey, get up. Here we go.

30:02.945 --> 30:05.709
See? I told you we'd make it.

30:07.283 --> 30:11.344
- Any other catastrophes?
- Lois Lane ate the class fish.

30:11.487 --> 30:13.614
Why does that not surprise me?

30:13.723 --> 30:16.317
- Sorry, Sammy.
- Lois Lane?

30:19.495 --> 30:21.759
Come on! We gotta hurry up!

30:21.831 --> 30:23.799
I gotta go to the bathroom.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.368
- I'll take you.
- Why don't I take her?

30:38.514 --> 30:42.575
So, Maggie, you know that lady,
Celia, from your dad's office?

30:42.652 --> 30:45.212
Yeah.

30:45.321 --> 30:48.256
- Is she your daddy's girlfriend?
- No way.

30:49.592 --> 30:51.651
She wants to be, but she isn't.

30:52.595 --> 30:57.157
He wants somebody who would love
his cookie too, and Celia's not the type.

30:58.401 --> 31:00.995
Let me get that other sock for you.

31:04.173 --> 31:07.870
There's no king when love is the thing

31:08.244 --> 31:10.940
Play the same rules

31:14.183 --> 31:18.813
In a heartbeat, a wise man can be a fool

31:20.990 --> 31:25.586
Through the darkest hours

31:26.429 --> 31:29.023
When all is said and done

31:29.098 --> 31:34.297
It has the power

31:34.904 --> 31:37.896
You go from lonely to the lucky one

31:38.007 --> 31:41.238
Cos love 's funny that way

31:42.311 --> 31:45.246
No matter who you are

31:46.015 --> 31:49.075
Oh, it can shake your faith

31:50.219 --> 31:53.814
Or it can break your heart

31:53.890 --> 31:55.221
Yeah, yeah

31:55.291 --> 31:57.452
There we go.

32:01.063 --> 32:02.894
Give me that.

32:02.999 --> 32:05.058
That's my cat.

32:07.336 --> 32:11.204
So maybe you and Maggie could
come over for dinner after the game.

32:11.274 --> 32:13.902
Order out a little Chinese or something.

32:15.945 --> 32:18.539
- Oh, thank God he's here.
- Dad!

32:23.753 --> 32:28.156
- So what do you say?
- I don't think so. It's been a long day.

32:30.426 --> 32:34.362
OK. Yeah, I'm a little... a little tired myself.

32:36.532 --> 32:42.027
- I should go over and say hi to Sammy's dad.
- I like to watch the game on the sidelines.

32:42.972 --> 32:45.065
OK.

32:45.975 --> 32:48.068
- It was a good day.
- Yeah.

32:48.544 --> 32:50.671
OK.

33:03.726 --> 33:05.159
All right. Come here.

33:06.762 --> 33:09.094
What? You can't even look at me?

33:09.165 --> 33:13.067
This is the second game
you've made it to in two years, Eddie.

33:13.135 --> 33:15.365
- Look, I'm here, aren't I?
- Daddy!

33:16.405 --> 33:18.771
Are you staying for the whole game?

33:18.875 --> 33:21.309
- You bet I am.
- Cool!

33:21.377 --> 33:24.744
I'm gonna play my best.
You watch me. My really best.

33:25.348 --> 33:27.373
That's great.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.951
Go get 'em, tiger.

33:31.287 --> 33:33.346
Come on. I saved us a seat.

33:35.191 --> 33:37.284
Here, Daddy.

33:48.137 --> 33:50.196
Hey, Dad!

33:55.111 --> 33:58.103
Part of the reason I came
was to tell Sammy in person

33:58.180 --> 34:02.617
that I'm not gonna be able
to make our fishing trip this summer.

34:02.752 --> 34:07.121
- You can't do this to him, Eddie.
- I got a gig playing with Bruce, Mel.

34:07.189 --> 34:10.317
Can't you see how much he needs you?

34:10.393 --> 34:13.328
Come on, Mel. You can't
expect me to pass this up.

34:16.197 --> 34:18.860
Mom! Hey, Mom! Look!

34:20.670 --> 34:22.399
Yes!

34:40.422 --> 34:42.983
Let's go, Maggie! Come on! Maggie, let's go!

34:43.059 --> 34:45.458
Down the alley! Right down the alley!

34:45.561 --> 34:48.826
Watch that kid! Bodycheck him, Maggie!

34:48.898 --> 34:52.664
- But that would be rude, Daddy.
- That's not rude! That's sports!

34:52.768 --> 34:54.860
That's it!

34:55.771 --> 34:58.365
Hey! Hey! Come on!

34:58.441 --> 35:01.103
- What's with that guy?
- Get that kid!

35:11.087 --> 35:13.681
- Good game there, Sammy.
- Thanks, Jack.

35:15.992 --> 35:18.790
- I'll see ya.
- Thanks for everything.

35:18.894 --> 35:21.124
You too. I'll see you.

35:21.230 --> 35:23.095
OK. Are you ready?

35:23.199 --> 35:25.258
OK. Hang on.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.401
You were great.

35:30.106 --> 35:32.540
So I'll see you real soon, OK, big guy?

35:32.641 --> 35:34.541
OK.

35:34.643 --> 35:37.043
- Bye, Mel.
- Bye.

35:47.890 --> 35:52.657
- Hey. Let's get your rain stuff on. OK?
- OK.

35:52.728 --> 35:54.821
Let me see your trophy.

36:00.069 --> 36:03.937
- Wow! Do you think that's real gold?
- Yeah.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.271
- You do? What is that on his head?
- A soccer ball.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.443
OK. Are you ready?

36:23.759 --> 36:27.559
- Should we try to get a cab, Mom?
- No. I kind of feel like walking.

36:27.663 --> 36:31.099
- In the rain?
- So? You're dressed for Niagara Falls.

36:31.600 --> 36:37.163
Have I told you lately that I love you?

36:39.608 --> 36:44.136
Have I told you there's no one above you?

36:46.882 --> 36:49.146
Fill my heart with gladness

36:50.319 --> 36:52.378
Take away my sadness

36:53.355 --> 36:56.791
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

37:00.496 --> 37:03.727
For the mornin ' sun in all its glory

37:06.335 --> 37:09.827
Greets the day with hope and comfort too

37:13.109 --> 37:16.010
And you fill my life with laughter...

37:17.913 --> 37:20.404
Mom, I'm hungry.

37:20.516 --> 37:22.575
I'll be right there, honey.

37:23.853 --> 37:26.378
All right. That's a deal.

37:26.922 --> 37:29.447
Give me this one. Come here. Good night.

37:30.159 --> 37:32.957
- Good night.
- He'll be right here in the box, OK?

37:33.062 --> 37:34.791
- OK.
- All right.

37:34.864 --> 37:37.856
You know, when me and Melanie
were in the bathroom,

37:37.967 --> 37:40.401
she asked me if Celia was your girlfriend.

37:40.469 --> 37:43.666
- She did?
- Yeah. She really likes you.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.974
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:49.845 --> 37:51.938
She told you she likes me?

37:52.047 --> 37:54.277
It's so obvious, Daddy.

37:54.383 --> 37:56.442
Night.

37:57.586 --> 37:59.781
Did she say anything else about me?

37:59.855 --> 38:04.622
I don't know, Daddy. I'm pretty tired.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

38:06.095 --> 38:08.188
Yeah.

38:11.267 --> 38:13.633
- What'll you do about those fish?
- What?

38:13.702 --> 38:15.363
We gotta go buy new fish.

38:15.437 --> 38:17.268
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

38:17.373 --> 38:21.776
Sammy can't go back to class tomorrow
without those fish. Mrs Fineman'll kill him.

38:21.844 --> 38:25.075
- I'm in my pajamas!
- I know, but we gotta help him out.

38:25.614 --> 38:27.673
Like the sun

38:32.588 --> 38:34.647
At the end of the day

38:36.292 --> 38:38.852
We will give thanks and pray

38:39.228 --> 38:41.287
To the one

38:45.267 --> 38:51.103
Have I told you lately that I love you?

38:53.709 --> 38:57.668
Have I told you there's no one above you?

39:00.349 --> 39:02.647
Fill my heart with gladness

39:03.819 --> 39:06.049
Take away my sadness

39:06.922 --> 39:09.686
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

39:13.729 --> 39:15.822
Take away my sadness

39:16.832 --> 39:19.960
Fill my life with gladness

39:20.035 --> 39:23.562
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

39:33.782 --> 39:35.340
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:35.651 --> 39:39.109
Maggie insisted that
we bring Sammy some new fish.

39:41.457 --> 39:43.516
Thank you.

39:46.395 --> 39:51.196
- Do you guys wanna come in for a minute?
- No, no. We don't wanna intrude.

39:52.668 --> 39:54.397
OK. Well...

39:54.503 --> 39:56.562
Yes. Here they are.

39:58.107 --> 40:00.575
- OK.
- OK. Thank you.

40:00.676 --> 40:02.735
Come on, Dad.

40:03.679 --> 40:08.082
- Come in. Please.
- OK. For a few minutes.

40:09.518 --> 40:11.577
Hi, Jack!

40:11.820 --> 40:13.913
Sammy!

40:14.890 --> 40:17.415
What do you weigh?

40:17.526 --> 40:19.994
- Wanna come see my room?
- OK.

40:26.368 --> 40:30.828
- You're investigating my apartment.
- Not as neat as I would've thought.

40:30.939 --> 40:34.238
It's only neat on Sundays
when my mother comes for brunch.

40:34.343 --> 40:37.244
If she sees it like this, she shakes her head,

40:37.346 --> 40:40.804
which means she's unhappy
with my life choices.

40:40.916 --> 40:46.320
And then she lets out a sigh that means she'd
have rather gone to my sister's for brunch.

40:52.261 --> 40:55.788
- You guys wanna watch a video?
- Yeah!

40:55.864 --> 40:58.594
- How about The Wizard of Oz?
- Yeah!

41:00.869 --> 41:05.033
You can get all snuggled up on my bed
and watch for a little while.

41:06.475 --> 41:08.875
- I wanna watch it all, Mommy.
- It's too late.

41:08.977 --> 41:12.606
You can watch for as long as it takes us
to drink one cup of coffee.

41:12.681 --> 41:15.775
- Two cups of coffee.
- We'll see.

41:21.790 --> 41:25.089
It's always such a dilemma
when you have kids.

41:26.061 --> 41:30.691
After Sammy's dad and I got divorced, I put
up pictures of him all over Sammy's room.

41:30.799 --> 41:35.896
I wanted to reassure him that, no matter what,
his dad would still be in his life.

41:36.572 --> 41:39.234
- You want cream, or...?
- No, that's fine.

41:40.309 --> 41:43.676
- Sammy talked about him all day today.
- I'm sure he did.

41:43.779 --> 41:48.409
- Is he really a rock'n'roll drummer?
- He's touring with Springsteen this summer.

41:48.484 --> 41:49.849
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:49.918 --> 41:52.978
Springsteen? Wow.

41:56.091 --> 42:01.529
You know... I'm beatin' around the bush
here and there's something I gotta ask you.

42:01.630 --> 42:03.427
Yes?

42:03.499 --> 42:09.233
Why did you spend all day flirting with me if
you meant to get back with your ex-husband?

42:09.304 --> 42:10.999
What?

42:11.073 --> 42:14.133
I spent the whole day disliking you intensely.

42:14.243 --> 42:18.270
You were flirting with me. You even
told the kids you wanted to ask me out.

42:18.414 --> 42:22.043
- I never told them that.
- Yes, you did. That was your big secret.

42:22.117 --> 42:26.884
They told me. It was all about you and me
and going somewhere and feelings.

42:26.955 --> 42:29.116
You were going to ask me out.

42:29.525 --> 42:32.688
The big secret was that Sammy
got my marble stuck up his nose.

42:32.761 --> 42:35.696
And I never once even thought
about asking you out.

42:35.764 --> 42:39.029
- I'm so sure.
- I don't know why I would even want to.

42:39.101 --> 42:41.865
You said I was the most beautiful woman
you'd ever seen.

42:41.937 --> 42:46.067
- That was a line.
- That was not a line, Jack, and you know it.

42:46.141 --> 42:49.542
You wanted me ever since
I knew you were a writer...

42:49.645 --> 42:55.106
You wanted me ever since the drop-in center
when you saw me put my watch on Maggie.

42:55.184 --> 42:58.278
For someone so disinterested
in the other person,

42:58.353 --> 43:02.346
- you sure do remember every detail.
- You remember better than I do.

43:02.491 --> 43:03.856
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

43:03.926 --> 43:06.520
- What would you do if I kissed you?
- You wouldn't.

43:06.595 --> 43:08.688
What would you do if I did?

43:09.865 --> 43:13.892
- Do you wanna kiss me?
- I wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't.

43:16.472 --> 43:18.531
Fine.

43:29.885 --> 43:32.979
You're just... reelin' me in, aren't you?

43:36.124 --> 43:38.922
You're like Roy Scheider at the end of Jaws.

43:39.962 --> 43:44.126
The minute I open my mouth,
you're gonna drop a big bomb in there.

43:45.234 --> 43:47.794
Then you'll wear my teeth around your neck.

43:47.903 --> 43:50.633
So you're admitting you're a big shark?

43:52.941 --> 43:55.000
I am admitting that I am...

43:56.411 --> 43:59.346
scared of getting close to anyone again.

44:00.315 --> 44:02.806
I'm just as scared as you are.

44:10.759 --> 44:12.818
- Don't bite.
- I won't.

44:28.343 --> 44:30.277
- Mommy.
- What?

44:30.379 --> 44:34.145
Can you fast-forward for us?
That mean lady is on and we hate that part.

44:34.216 --> 44:36.650
Sweetheart, you know how to fast-forward.

44:36.752 --> 44:40.381
- The remote's broken.
- And she's stealing Toto.

44:40.455 --> 44:42.889
There. She's gone. OK?

44:43.425 --> 44:46.622
This is the colored part. You love this part.

45:10.919 --> 45:12.477
- Wait.
- Yeah. OK.

45:12.621 --> 45:14.680
No, let's do this right.

45:14.790 --> 45:20.023
Let me go in and freshen up so I feel
more like a woman and not a dead mommy.

45:20.095 --> 45:22.188
- OK.
- OK?

45:22.464 --> 45:25.865
Why don't you go in and
go sit over there and...

45:26.635 --> 45:31.299
close your eyes, lay your head back
and anticipate my return.

45:31.707 --> 45:33.538
OK.

45:33.675 --> 45:36.337
Or you can go in and watch The Wizard of Oz

45:36.445 --> 45:38.504
and wait for me to come back.

45:42.517 --> 45:44.644
Yeah, OK.

45:50.158 --> 45:52.718
One fine day

45:52.828 --> 45:55.422
You'll look at me

45:55.497 --> 46:00.935
And you will know
our love was meant to be

46:01.036 --> 46:03.664
One fine day

46:03.739 --> 46:09.871
You're gonna want me for your girl

46:11.847 --> 46:17.080
Though I know you're the kind of boy

46:17.152 --> 46:21.282
Who only wants to run around

46:22.557 --> 46:27.551
I'll keep waiting and someday, darling

46:27.696 --> 46:32.258
You'll come to me
when you want to settle down

46:32.334 --> 46:36.065
Oh, one fine day

46:36.138 --> 46:38.698
We'll meet once more

46:38.774 --> 46:44.144
And then you'll want the love
you threw away before

46:44.212 --> 46:46.874
One fine day

46:46.948 --> 46:51.749
You're gonna want me for your girl

46:55.624 --> 46:57.751
It stopped raining.

47:01.396 --> 47:03.489
Jack?

47:47.042 --> 47:51.035
You're out of the woods, you're
out of the dark, you're out of the night

47:51.146 --> 47:54.411
Step into the sun, step into the light

47:55.250 --> 47:57.582
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious...

47:57.652 --> 47:59.745
I wonder what they're doing.

48:03.191 --> 48:07.389
You're out of the woods, you're
out of the dark, you're out of the night

48:07.462 --> 48:10.158
Step into the sun, step into the light

48:11.566 --> 48:15.627
Hold onto your breath, hold onto
your heart, hold onto your hope

48:15.704 --> 48:20.403
Step into the sun, step into the light,
march up to the gate and bid it...

48:20.609 --> 48:22.474
Open

48:22.644 --> 48:24.703
Open

48:38.393 --> 48:41.487
You got to give a little

48:42.531 --> 48:44.624
Take a little

48:44.933 --> 48:48.664
And let your poor heart break a little

48:49.704 --> 48:51.934
That's the story of

48:52.040 --> 48:54.508
That's the glory of love

48:57.479 --> 48:59.538
You got to laugh a little

49:01.149 --> 49:03.242
Cry a little

49:03.552 --> 49:07.249
Before the clouds roll by just a little

49:08.290 --> 49:10.554
That's the story of

49:10.659 --> 49:13.150
That's the glory of love

49:16.631 --> 49:20.032
And as long as there 's the two of us

49:21.269 --> 49:24.830
We 've got the world and all its charms

49:25.907 --> 49:29.172
And when the world is through with us

49:29.978 --> 49:33.914
We 've got each other's arms

49:33.982 --> 49:36.678
You've got to win a little

49:37.752 --> 49:39.845
Lose a little

49:39.955 --> 49:43.789
And always have the blues a little

49:44.659 --> 49:46.786
But that's the story of

49:46.895 --> 49:49.125
And that's the glory of love

50:02.711 --> 50:04.770
Are those your eyes?

50:06.915 --> 50:09.008
Is that your smile?

50:11.519 --> 50:14.818
I've been lookin ' at you forever

50:15.824 --> 50:18.987
But I never saw you before

50:19.561 --> 50:22.086
Are these your hands

50:22.831 --> 50:26.028
Holding mine?

50:28.003 --> 50:33.635
Now I wonder how I could've been so blind

50:35.777 --> 50:39.770
And for the first time

50:40.215 --> 50:43.446
I am looking in your eyes

50:44.352 --> 50:46.149
For the first time

50:46.221 --> 50:49.850
I'm seein' who you are

50:51.626 --> 50:55.323
I can't believe how much I see

50:56.398 --> 51:00.027
When you're lookin' back at me

51:00.535 --> 51:04.528
Now I understand what love is

51:05.440 --> 51:07.533
Love is

51:08.677 --> 51:10.770
For the first time

51:16.184 --> 51:18.550
Can this be real?

51:20.088 --> 51:22.682
Can this be true?

51:24.826 --> 51:28.159
Am I the person I was this mornin'

51:28.964 --> 51:32.092
And are you the same you?

51:32.767 --> 51:35.497
It's all so strange

51:35.837 --> 51:39.432
How can it be?

51:41.076 --> 51:47.311
All along this love was right in front of me

51:49.384 --> 51:52.979
And for the first time

51:53.488 --> 51:56.616
I am looking in your eyes

51:57.459 --> 52:03.261
For the first time, I'm seein ' who you are

52:04.833 --> 52:08.826
I can 't believe how much I see

52:09.471 --> 52:13.271
When you're lookin ' back at me

52:13.742 --> 52:17.508
Now I understand what love is

52:18.646 --> 52:20.705
Love is

52:21.716 --> 52:24.207
For the first time

52:29.891 --> 52:33.156
Such a long time ago

52:34.095 --> 52:40.466
I had given up on findin' this emotion

52:41.436 --> 52:44.872
Ever again

52:46.274 --> 52:49.732
But you're here with me now

52:50.078 --> 52:54.481
Yes, I found you somehow

52:55.116 --> 53:00.349
And I've never been so sure

53:10.465 --> 53:13.866
And for the first time

53:14.736 --> 53:17.933
I am looking in your eyes

53:18.807 --> 53:20.900
For the first time

53:20.975 --> 53:24.741
I'm seein' who you are

53:26.214 --> 53:29.945
I can't believe how much I see

53:30.952 --> 53:35.616
When you're lookin' back at me

53:37.325 --> 53:42.319
Now I understand what love is

53:43.531 --> 53:46.432
Love is

53:47.969 --> 53:51.234
For the first time

53:52.305 --> 53:58.397
