00:21.373 --> 00:23.720
Looks like massive head trauma.
She's bleeding bad. I'm going in, man.

00:28.955 --> 00:30.707
Lacerations. The neck, the head, the arms.

00:34.590 --> 00:35.736
Alright.
- No, stay there.

00:36.415 --> 00:38.545
- Hand me that.
- I can't go any further.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.396
There we go.

00:43.442 --> 00:46.190
Toby, we've got a problem.
- Yeah, don't tell me you're stuck.

00:46.751 --> 00:48.317
Okay then. I won't mention it.

00:51.304 --> 00:52.421
You're kidding, right?

00:54.368 --> 00:56.338
It's over. They're stuck.

00:56.225 --> 00:57.883
Copy that, stand down.

01:02.020 --> 01:02.820
Brilliant.

01:03.537 --> 01:06.461
Absolutely brilliant.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.327
So you're an actress?

01:21.530 --> 01:23.019
So you boys could use a hand?

01:25.342 --> 01:29.813
- Alright, so it's not our finest hour, my friend.
-At least nobody died, that's something.

01:30.019 --> 01:31.074
Well, the day is not over yet.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.329
You know, if we don't pass evaluations,
we could get de-certified.

01:34.379 --> 01:35.519
We'll be fine.

01:35.519 --> 01:39.960
We lose certification, we'll be down to low
priority transport. You know what that means.

01:39.965 --> 01:40.896
Yeah, we're taxi drivers.

01:40.897 --> 01:42.427
No, we're taxi drivers with a speed limit.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.366
I can't do the speed limits.

01:45.981 --> 01:46.951
You can't.

01:47.347 --> 01:49.720
Alright, that's it. Double check the rig.
We cannot afford to fail inspections.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.861
You're right, you're right.

02:05.154 --> 02:08.579
I know I'm the one that got us stuck in here,
but you wanna help me out here...

02:10.142 --> 02:11.242
Or what?

02:42.480 --> 02:46.691
Season 01 Episode 02
"Emotional Rescue"

02:54.764 --> 02:59.489
*Subs by Maiden*

03:20.338 --> 03:22.199
What's going on?
- Relax. You're okay, you're in an ambulance.

03:23.557 --> 03:25.369
What happened?
-Your apartment blew up.

03:25.369 --> 03:27.151
What's your name?
-Vince.

03:27.151 --> 03:29.004
Vince, my name is Toby. My partner's
the best driver in the city.

03:29.004 --> 03:30.882
We'll get you to the hospital in ten minutes.

03:32.436 --> 03:33.654
Okay, make that five!

03:34.185 --> 03:36.664
Oh, man, I don't believe this.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.247
It's not as bad as it looks.

03:38.497 --> 03:40.854
No man, you cut my favorite shirt.

03:41.878 --> 03:44.135
Alright, I'll get you a new
one man, I promise.

03:47.512 --> 03:50.036
We've got a heart rate of 130.
BP 80 systolic.

03:50.261 --> 03:51.795
Reduced breath on the left side.

03:51.795 --> 03:54.755
We've got burns and lacerations
on the head, chest, arms.

03:54.823 --> 03:56.934
Hold up.
What's the word?

03:56.934 --> 03:58.799
Fire's got it under control. How many vics?

03:58.799 --> 04:01.028
Ah, just a couple. He's the worst
of them. It's his place that blew up.

04:01.248 --> 04:03.839
Let's get him to Trauma 1 now. Fawcett, watch the ***.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.350
Toby, you're bleeding.

04:11.105 --> 04:12.117
Let me take care of that.

04:15.024 --> 04:16.790
What did you do?
-It's nothing, I just...

04:17.725 --> 04:19.382
I was near the building when it blew.

04:19.755 --> 04:22.288
How did you manage that anyway?
We were like a block away from evaluation.

04:22.288 --> 04:26.426
I don't know, I just saw the smoke.
-Saw smoke? What are you talking about?

04:26.728 --> 04:29.836
-Oz, don't you know by now? Just don't ask.

04:31.507 --> 04:33.105
Never get a straight answer.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.517
Dr. Fawcett, you're wanted in Trauma 3.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.113
Don't go anywhere, okay?
I'll stitch you up in a minute.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.521
You really gotta get over your Olivia thing.

04:43.521 --> 04:45.476
Oh, thank you. Olivia and I are good.

04:45.476 --> 04:47.982
Really? 'Cause you're all broken up and done...

04:47.982 --> 04:51.772
And still the ER is thick with
moody looks and innuendo.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.078
I'm not saying I understand innuendo,
I'm just aware that it exists.

04:58.078 --> 05:00.871
Alright, well sorry for ruining the tranquility
of your Emergency Room experience.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.519
Hey, either move in or move on.
This in between thing is like a bad haircut.

05:04.519 --> 05:06.152
Something you'd know a
thing or two about, right?

05:06.763 --> 05:08.905
You should come out with me, start
looking around. I could be your wingman.

05:08.905 --> 05:11.250
You mean I could be your wingman?
- It works both ways.

05:11.798 --> 05:12.800
That'd be nice.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.706
You know, my uncle always says the best way to get over
your troubles is to go out and find some new kind of trouble.

05:17.019 --> 05:18.831
That's probably why all my cousins have done time.

05:22.829 --> 05:25.775
You're gonna get that thing looked at
before you start bleeding all over?

05:27.069 --> 05:28.179
Come here, look at this.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.162
Hold still, so I can make it straight.

05:34.173 --> 05:36.673
So, there's a good story to go with this?

05:36.666 --> 05:37.681
A collapsed roof, maybe a little axe wielding action?

05:39.696 --> 05:41.515
Would that work?
- What?

05:41.744 --> 05:43.135
Making a good impression.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.877
The truth always makes the best impression.

05:51.666 --> 05:54.478
Well, in that case, I got my arm jammed in
the hose rigging when we were pulling out.

05:58.544 --> 06:00.886
Actually, maybe a little axe wielding
action would've been better.

06:02.969 --> 06:05.783
Hey, it's better than a paper cut on the
site of a calendar shoot or anything.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.088
- You're not...

06:10.672 --> 06:11.916
September.

06:13.004 --> 06:14.458
Hey, it's for charity.

06:16.394 --> 06:17.365
Hey, Liv.

06:17.537 --> 06:20.171
Sorry, I didn't know you were with a patient.

06:20.237 --> 06:23.111
No it's okay. This is Toby Logan. And Tom...

06:23.225 --> 06:25.784
Crawford. Yeah, we met this morning.

06:26.378 --> 06:29.585
Yeah, I was doing standby at the evals. Great fun.

06:30.211 --> 06:33.852
Okay, Liv. I thought maybe you could sew me up.

06:33.950 --> 06:35.209
Right.
- I'll come back later.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.586
No, no, no. That's okay, Toby. You always wait too
long with these things and then it just never right.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.322
You're gonna live?

06:48.243 --> 06:49.244
Uh, it's touch and go.

06:50.292 --> 06:52.665
I heard you were one of the
first responders to today’s fire.

06:52.869 --> 06:55.014
We were training nearby.
We were all there pretty quick.

06:55.260 --> 06:57.298
Uh, Detective Marks.
- Yes?

06:57.449 --> 07:00.714
I have the last of the victims statements from the fire.

07:01.058 --> 07:03.591
I'm gonna head over to Mercy General
and follow up on that bus crash.

07:04.140 --> 07:08.015
Toby Logan, this is Kyle Elson
from Victim Resources.

07:08.082 --> 07:11.174
Oh hey, you're the guy that got stuck in the car.
Yeah, they had to get a fireman to cut him out.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.028
No, that wasn't me.

07:13.394 --> 07:17.641
Though we're all just the same.
I see how you would think that it was me.

07:17.941 --> 07:21.154
Yeah, right, right. Bye.

07:24.824 --> 07:26.961
Anything unusual about this fire?

07:27.492 --> 07:32.124
No, the sad thing is, accidental meth
lab explosions are pretty usual.

07:32.273 --> 07:33.810
You guys sure it's a meth lab?

07:33.898 --> 07:36.424
Yeah, a kid in the building is a well know cooker.

07:36.714 --> 07:40.278
Uh, I gotta wait 'till he wakes up before I
bring him in. A guy by the name of Vince Pirell.

07:40.611 --> 07:44.278
Vince. His last name is Pirell?
- Yeah, why? You know him?

07:44.872 --> 07:46.684
I think he might've told me that when he came in.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.782
Okay, well. If you think of anything
else, you know where to find me.

07:51.072 --> 07:51.855
Alright, yeah.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.342
Hey, rock star.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.458
I'm the medic who brought you in.

08:03.084 --> 08:04.627
Hey man, where do I know you from?

08:06.147 --> 08:08.286
I think we spent a couple of months
together at the Auffrey's.

08:09.776 --> 08:10.675
Toby.

08:11.435 --> 08:13.316
Dude, you were badass.

08:13.486 --> 08:16.342
You kidding me, I still am badass.
Just on the weekends now.

08:18.505 --> 08:20.049
Toby Logan.

08:21.053 --> 08:23.551
Man, I don't believe this.
We should hook up and hang sometime.

08:23.844 --> 08:25.066
You got it, man. You got it.

08:26.454 --> 08:30.815
Vince, the cops think you're cooking.
They wanna bring you in.

08:31.441 --> 08:34.710
No, man. I swear, I was just
hanging out. I don't cook.

08:34.990 --> 08:36.140
Not anymore.

08:37.427 --> 08:38.818
So, your apartment exploded?

08:47.252 --> 08:50.658
Oh, damn, I still had some supplies and a full tank.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.145
Yeah, that'll do it.

08:52.713 --> 08:56.683
But, I saw a flame before it blew.
It came out of the vent.

08:59.902 --> 09:01.239
Before it blew? Are you sure?

09:01.740 --> 09:03.755
They're gonna pin this
on me, man. I can feel it.

09:16.206 --> 09:19.955
It wasn't an accident. The fire. Pirell didn't start it.

09:20.456 --> 09:21.214
And you know this how?

09:21.465 --> 09:23.591
He told me. He said he saw
a flame before the explosion.

09:24.139 --> 09:25.614
Oh well, if the tweaker said so.

09:26.639 --> 09:30.795
Look, inspectors went through the place, alright?
Initial report says the explosion's consistent with a meth lab.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.138
Vince still had chemicals, but he wasn't cooking.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.879
-Alright, the fire was set.
And what makes you think that?

09:38.723 --> 09:41.100
I took this with my phone.

09:42.271 --> 09:44.646
Inside the heating duct of the unit under Vince’s place.

09:44.961 --> 09:46.084
I think it's some kind of timer.

09:46.858 --> 09:48.960
You went to the building?
- Yeah, I didn't touch anything.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.309
It doesn't matter. You shouldn't have
been there. This is a crime scene.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.789
Okay, and you're looking at the crime.
- This could be anything.

09:53.858 --> 09:57.680
Sorry, but I'm not about to step on anyone's toes
based on a blurry picture that I shouldn't even have.

09:57.836 --> 09:59.872
And on the word of some meth cooking tweaker.

10:00.151 --> 10:01.548
Great, okay. Don't step on any toes.

10:02.137 --> 10:04.310
You might end up doing paperwork
on the midnight shift.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.713
Wow, somebody was up all night.

10:58.889 --> 11:02.824
Hey, you knew there was over
350 cases of arson last year?

11:03.095 --> 11:06.452
Yes, I did. We have the second highest rate
of set fires in the area after Buffalo.

11:06.689 --> 11:08.168
I think they were just trying to stay warm, though.

11:09.809 --> 11:12.184
What? I know stuff. Ask me about climate change.

11:12.264 --> 11:14.606
I'm like the Turkish All Gore.
- Look at this.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.368
Five apartment fires downtown
in the past six weeks.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.515
Is this about that crispy dude
we brought in yesterday?

11:20.848 --> 11:22.271
The cops say he blew his meth lab.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.878
They were wrong. I know
Vince. At least I used to.

11:25.212 --> 11:26.963
The cops are just trying to pin it
on him, because it's easy to do.

11:27.952 --> 11:31.601
He didn't do it. So I'm gonna give
him some options. Just in case.

11:31.673 --> 11:34.082
Them? You mean that Detective.

11:34.144 --> 11:36.091
Marks.
- Yeah, Detective Marks.

11:36.361 --> 11:40.000
Hey man, I'm glad you're getting over Olivia, but maybe
you wanna start with somebody that doesn't carry a gun.

11:40.106 --> 11:42.176
All I have is a whole bunch of suspicious fires.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.546
And I have no idea who set them.

11:44.677 --> 11:48.530
Well, Toby, arsony is not something you just pick
up like stripper ****. It's usually repeat offenders.

11:48.861 --> 11:52.001
Arsonists have to register with the cops.
They keep a real close watch on them.

11:52.065 --> 11:54.056
Does that mean you can get
me a list of suspects?

11:54.743 --> 11:56.723
If I know where to look. And I do.

11:57.019 --> 11:59.361
I know a guy in arson who owes
me a favor. He'll take care of it.

11:59.813 --> 12:01.534
Right now, we gotta get to work.

12:08.025 --> 12:08.888
Hi, thank you.

12:10.575 --> 12:12.723
Tom. Oh, you're back so soon.

12:12.781 --> 12:15.507
Yeah, yeah, I tore some stitches up in gym.

12:15.804 --> 12:17.577
Guess I should've taken it
easy for a day or two.

12:20.924 --> 12:22.058
Hey, uh...

12:25.485 --> 12:28.083
You noticed there's been a lot of
apartment fires downtown lately?

12:28.329 --> 12:31.611
Yeah, I guess.
- More than usual?

12:32.237 --> 12:35.009
Actually, you know, some of the guys at the
station were talking about that yesterday.

12:35.348 --> 12:38.909
Yeah? What, did they think it's suspicious?
- Suspicious how?

12:39.329 --> 12:40.797
Like they're being set.

12:41.207 --> 12:44.583
No, man. I mean, I just put out the fires.

12:44.823 --> 12:48.123
The investigators check out all the
hows and why. Why do you ask?

12:48.621 --> 12:50.265
I just thought it was
kinda weird, that's all.

12:53.018 --> 12:56.496
Tom. I'm ready to see you.

13:01.418 --> 13:03.772
So I'll see you later at
the driving evaluations.

13:04.881 --> 13:06.966
Well, uh, good luck.

13:07.226 --> 13:09.106
Try not to get stuck this time, okay?

13:09.030 --> 13:10.029
Thanks. Yeah, thanks.

13:12.775 --> 13:16.323
So, what happened?
- I was working out...

13:24.540 --> 13:27.947
Yeah, yeah. Big deal, oh yeah. Bravo.

13:29.899 --> 13:31.337
Alright, so we're up next.
You ready for this?

13:31.446 --> 13:34.423
Oh yeah. I took this baby down to my uncle
Eppo's garage. Got the whole thing power washed.

13:34.987 --> 13:36.588
I even used some of that new car smell stuff.

13:36.809 --> 13:38.652
Great, so, it's an evaluation.
It's not a truck show.

13:38.933 --> 13:43.259
Yeah, I know. If it was a truck show,
I would've, I would've switched out the rims.

13:44.775 --> 13:47.059
Oh, look who decided to come watch.

13:47.775 --> 13:51.652
Hey, I'm sure it's just breezy conversation
between two colleagues.

13:52.141 --> 13:55.871
Two hot colleagues in their sexual prime.

13:56.205 --> 13:58.996
Oh, and he's going for the number.
And she's giving it, wow!

14:00.230 --> 14:01.861
It's probably just professional courteously.

14:02.184 --> 14:05.342
You know how it is, in case she has
any fire related work questions.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.450
See, look. He scared her off.
She can't get away soon enough.

14:08.420 --> 14:12.053
Is he going for the cutesy callback? Wow, that
is a risky play. That could go either way.

14:13.609 --> 14:14.495
And it's good!

14:16.396 --> 14:20.339
But it's so lame. That is just...
I mean, who does that?

14:20.585 --> 14:22.419
Seriously, I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

14:22.691 --> 14:24.125
Just be cool. It'll be fine.

14:26.250 --> 14:29.583
Mr. Bey, Logan. You're up.

14:31.331 --> 14:33.096
Try not to blow it like yesterday.

14:34.028 --> 14:35.485
I am gonna own this course.

14:49.202 --> 14:50.075
Brilliant.

14:50.730 --> 14:52.286
Absolutely brilliant.

14:52.380 --> 14:56.059
Uncle Eppo power washed the whole vehicle,
but he didn't check the engine?

14:57.254 --> 14:58.540
It would appear that way.

15:01.243 --> 15:03.848
You know, I asked my uncle Eppo to make
it shine. I didn't say power wash the engine.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.416
That's fine, man. Are you in the arsonist registry?

15:06.709 --> 15:08.131
Almost. Let's keep an eye out for Ryder.

15:08.666 --> 15:12.074
I mean, with trouble as it is, if he catches me hacking
the system, I might as well turn in my uniform.

15:12.493 --> 15:14.008
I look good in my uniform.
- Oz, come on.

15:14.905 --> 15:17.157
There it is. Just where
my buddy said to look.

15:19.438 --> 15:20.252
Hey, here's something.

15:22.065 --> 15:23.606
Alright, who's Wade Richter?

15:23.650 --> 15:27.371
It says here he did three years for torching
an unfinished condo. Got out last summer.

15:27.541 --> 15:28.993
Just the basics, but look where he lives.

15:29.181 --> 15:30.516
Yeah, right around the
corner from yesterday’s fire.

15:30.994 --> 15:33.808
Look, all those fires you're looking into
were within ten blocks of his place.

15:34.073 --> 15:34.778
Can you print this?

15:38.887 --> 15:39.593
Voila.

15:39.837 --> 15:42.994
Hey, if this info gets you any action with
that Detective, I want every little detail.

15:43.187 --> 15:44.074
You got it. Thanks, Oz.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.294
I'll settle for a synopsis.

15:50.122 --> 15:51.038
Mrs. Richter.

15:51.387 --> 15:53.226
I'm a friend of Wades, from work.

15:53.897 --> 15:55.974
Is that Levi, Wade’s friend?

15:56.994 --> 15:58.601
Hi. I'm Levi. Maybe he mentioned me?

15:58.897 --> 16:00.851
Oh, yes, off course.

16:02.183 --> 16:03.998
I'm sorry. Wade's not here right now.

16:04.418 --> 16:07.969
That's too bad. I lent Wade my camping stove.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.731
I'm heading up north and I
was hoping I could pick it up.

16:10.842 --> 16:12.390
Sorry, I'm sure I haven't seen it.

16:12.516 --> 16:14.685
I'm planning a little surprise
get-away for my girlfriend...

16:14.919 --> 16:16.764
Such a nice boy.

16:17.252 --> 16:19.579
Can you think of any place
he might be keeping it?

16:22.033 --> 16:25.200
Well, there, there is a place where
Wade works on some of his projects.

17:35.630 --> 17:36.658
Oh!
- Don't move!

17:39.458 --> 17:41.757
The guy's upstairs. Come on.

17:41.840 --> 17:42.819
I said don't move.

17:44.058 --> 17:44.968
You don't want to get him?

17:46.628 --> 17:47.973
What are you doing?
- I followed you.

17:48.059 --> 17:48.748
Me?

17:48.782 --> 17:51.393
Yeah. How'd you know about the timer?
- You found it?

17:52.049 --> 17:54.770
Yeah. I had the fire investigators
take a second look.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.473
They found the timer exactly
where you said it would be.

17:56.767 --> 17:57.835
Alright, so you believe me.

17:57.893 --> 18:00.193
I'm just trying to figure out if you
put it there before or after the fire.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.424
Wow, wow, wow. You think I did it?

18:02.569 --> 18:04.683
Makes sense to me.
A paramedic with a hero complex.

18:04.941 --> 18:07.473
A guy that puts lives in danger so
he can rescue them. Be the big man.

18:07.913 --> 18:08.634
This is insane.

18:08.896 --> 18:12.459
And I'm guessing you have the key to this place right now.
And a very good reason why you're on private property.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.713
Yeah, I was doing your job.

18:15.477 --> 18:19.586
Because you didn't want to take the word
of some tweaker. Who's right, by the way.

18:20.096 --> 18:23.391
Wade Richter, a convicted pyre, lives in the neighborhood.

18:23.523 --> 18:27.616
A few minutes ago he was upstairs,
praying at the altar of Crazy.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.555
Check it out yourself.

18:38.560 --> 18:42.187
You realize, by you being in the building,
that the evidence has been contaminated, right?

18:42.348 --> 18:45.515
Yeah. Yeah, that is, if you decide to tell anyone.

18:46.528 --> 18:49.576
Alright, I'll look into Richter, but I don't want to
see you anywhere near this case, do you hear me?

18:49.960 --> 18:50.866
Loud and clear.

18:54.947 --> 18:56.994
You told that guy to put some
pants on before we got in there.

18:57.042 --> 18:59.229
Oz, he threw his back out.
It's really hard to...

18:59.369 --> 19:02.275
Well, I've got whiplash from
trying not to look at his junk.

19:02.416 --> 19:03.448
Yeah, I saw you look, though.

19:03.791 --> 19:07.704
Maybe I'll get a workman’s comp. Yeah, "mental anguish" waver.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.294
Hey, what happened with that
pyro guy you were looking into?

19:10.389 --> 19:12.309
Well, I gave the cops his name.
They're gonna look into it.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.045
And?

19:13.108 --> 19:16.281
And it's not gonna take them long to realize
that he's the guy that's starting all the fires.

19:16.801 --> 19:20.098
And? Did you make an impression
on Detective Marks?

19:22.037 --> 19:23.177
Come on, give me something.

19:24.116 --> 19:25.492
Well, she showed me her gun.

19:27.865 --> 19:29.161
That's hot.
- Drive.

19:34.787 --> 19:37.149
I got it. Best one they had.

19:38.954 --> 19:40.131
Dude, you didn't have to.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.506
Yeah, I keep my promises.
The inexpensive ones at least.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.736
Hey, if you need anything,
Vic Resources will help you out.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.548
Call people...
- Dude, you know I got no family.

19:51.986 --> 19:53.962
How about a friend? A girl?

19:54.424 --> 19:56.862
No, man, I'm solo.

19:59.426 --> 20:00.302
Heather...

20:02.904 --> 20:04.032
What about Heather?

20:04.874 --> 20:06.658
You mentioned her name a couple
of times when you were out of it.

20:07.548 --> 20:10.126
Oh yeah, it's just a girl I knew.

20:10.965 --> 20:14.012
Okay, I get it. Conquest, no last names.

20:14.904 --> 20:18.714
No man, this girl's alright.
She's the coolest chick I ever met.

20:19.327 --> 20:22.705
So, uh, why isn't she here? What happened?

20:25.051 --> 20:28.437
I got issues, you know. I'm not
the easiest person to be around.

20:29.427 --> 20:32.065
I didn't want to drag her into my screwed
up life. She deserves better, you know?

20:33.596 --> 20:35.906
Yeah, believe me, man. I do.

20:37.068 --> 20:40.709
Besides, I'm sweet, young and sexy.
I don't wanna be tied down.

20:40.809 --> 20:43.152
I could be rocking this bed.
See man, I'm sizzling.

20:46.292 --> 20:50.275
I hear you and it's totally your call. But if you do, change your mind.

20:50.543 --> 20:53.543
You just take my number and call.
Totally confidential. *** office. Just call.

20:54.772 --> 20:55.599
Thank you.
- Okay.

20:59.928 --> 21:02.073
Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

21:02.301 --> 21:03.611
How are you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

21:04.084 --> 21:06.927
Good. Uh, I was wondering if you
could find a Heather Wallace?

21:07.631 --> 21:08.372
Uh, who?

21:08.663 --> 21:10.913
She's a friend of Vince Pirells.
She might be a waitress.

21:11.349 --> 21:13.919
Okay, one of his buddies?
- She's someone I think you should talk to.

21:14.242 --> 21:18.070
Great, give me an address, a number.

21:18.272 --> 21:19.467
That's uh, that's all I've got.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.696
Well, listen, man. I just don't think I've got time
to run around town looking for a girl, who uh,

21:22.781 --> 21:25.313
might not exist for a guy who probably
got what he deserved anyway.

21:26.403 --> 21:28.309
I know what you think,
but I don't think Vince did it.

21:28.369 --> 21:30.387
The cops actually think it might be arson.

21:31.305 --> 21:34.831
Come on, man. The guy's in rough shape.
- Well, Toby. I'll do what I can.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.223
And, uh, I just can't promise anything.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.666
Alright, thank you.
- No problem.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.314
How about tonight? "The Matty"?

21:59.349 --> 22:00.694
Finally, some company.

22:02.851 --> 22:04.007
Not very smart, Wade.

22:04.104 --> 22:06.744
Using your uncles old warehouse
as your little art project.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.028
Don't know what you're talking about.

22:11.321 --> 22:12.117
What do you call this?

22:13.728 --> 22:16.509
Therapy. It keeps the urges down.

22:17.509 --> 22:18.652
Most of them.

22:20.009 --> 22:22.759
Officers are searching your warehouse
and your moms place right now.

22:23.194 --> 22:27.617
And I think you know what it is that they're
gonna find. Maybe something like this?

22:29.399 --> 22:31.792
We found it at the torched apartment
in your neighborhood the other day.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.043
I don't know anything about that.
- Oh, I think you do.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.419
'Cause that's exactly like the
one you used in that condo fire.

22:39.434 --> 22:41.983
So you'd hook up one of these to the igniter hidden in the vent 

22:42.167 --> 22:43.941
Then you detached a *****.

22:44.753 --> 22:46.638
Really Wade? *****?

22:47.670 --> 22:49.082
That way, when it lights...

22:49.878 --> 22:53.047
Whoosh...
It spreads everywhere.

22:54.138 --> 22:58.486
Plastic melts. Impossible to trace.

22:59.988 --> 23:01.422
When it's done right.

23:02.891 --> 23:06.643
Then you need to be more careful.
'Cause your name's written all over this fire.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.622
Then somebody's trying to set me up.

23:09.825 --> 23:11.342
Right, because you've paid your dues?

23:12.233 --> 23:13.809
Fully recovered? No more urges?

23:16.702 --> 23:17.743
See this timer?

23:18.773 --> 23:21.938
It can't be set anymore than
12 hours in advance.

23:22.688 --> 23:25.970
The day of that fire, I was doing
back to back shifts in Burlington.

23:26.596 --> 23:30.786
Only a half hour for lunch.
There's no way I could've done this.

23:31.683 --> 23:32.724
Check it out.

24:02.810 --> 24:05.661
Hey Tom, we're gonna set up triage across
the street in case there's multiple vics.

24:07.292 --> 24:08.915
I'm afraid I'll do it again.

24:16.378 --> 24:18.812
What are you looking at? Let's go!

24:40.900 --> 24:43.015
I'm afraid I'll do it again.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.082
Okay, so tonight, we've got options.
"The Riv" has bands.

25:01.277 --> 25:02.923
$10 cover, but they could suck.

25:02.937 --> 25:05.230
"Beverbank" is probably packed, but it's all college girls.

25:05.344 --> 25:08.714
So, it's like
"OMG, LOL. Chat, chat, chat. You like me as a person."

25:08.843 --> 25:11.572
"The Mac", it's all drag queens

25:11.668 --> 25:12.855
and hot girls who like drag queens.

25:12.904 --> 25:15.400
But think about this: There's a distinct advantage
to being the only straight guys in there.

25:15.954 --> 25:18.000
So, that's my little theory, I think.

25:17.755 --> 25:19.767
You know what?
Oz, I'd like to go here.

25:20.410 --> 25:23.223
"The Matty"? What's here?

25:28.665 --> 25:30.884
Okay, pretty nice place.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.296
Hey, hey, check out who it is.

25:39.995 --> 25:41.572
Toby. What are you doing here?

25:41.713 --> 25:45.934
I'm just blowing off some steam, you know.
I thought you were busy tonight?

25:45.935 --> 25:48.865
I was, but...
-Hey.

25:48.949 --> 25:51.861
How's it going?
-  Good.

25:55.342 --> 25:57.081
About to get a lot better.

26:00.072 --> 26:01.039
Wanna join us?

26:01.916 --> 26:02.938
Yeah.

26:11.188 --> 26:12.732
You're driving me crazy. Get lost.

26:13.026 --> 26:14.543
Alright ****. You guys want another round?

26:14.721 --> 26:17.215
I'm in.
- Where's Oz anyway?

26:18.221 --> 26:21.690
I don't know, it looks like he's
working at his next projects.

26:22.484 --> 26:24.906
I should probably stick around
and make sure he's okay.

26:34.995 --> 26:37.369
The search at Richter’s place did not show anything.
- I know.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.026
What about his alibi?

26:39.372 --> 26:42.278
His boss called an hour ago saying he'll sign
an affidavit proving Richter never left.

26:42.450 --> 26:45.125
So why the hell is he still in holding?
- I know he had something to do with it.

26:45.561 --> 26:48.843
The timers, the ****.
The initial report matches his MO perfectly.

26:49.050 --> 26:51.395
Maybe you just don't like to be wrong.
- You know anyone who does?

26:51.439 --> 26:53.436
Cut him loose. Turn it over to Arson.

26:54.902 --> 26:56.311
Anything turns up,
they'll know where to find him.

27:00.739 --> 27:04.140
You know that the cops said that
that fire the other day might be set.

27:04.835 --> 27:06.936
That, uh, it might be
connected to some others.

27:07.344 --> 27:08.163
Oh, yeah?

27:09.411 --> 27:13.048
I mean, I just find that kind of crazy...

27:13.284 --> 27:14.930
That someone would set a fire
that put heroes like you in danger.

27:15.284 --> 27:16.833
If he only knew.

27:19.756 --> 27:24.116
So cowardly to just sit back like that,
knowing that people were gonna get hurt.

27:25.035 --> 27:26.556
I have to finish this now.

27:27.144 --> 27:28.072
Ready to go?

27:28.660 --> 27:33.285
Actually, I've got an early shift, tomorrow.
I should swing by the station.

27:34.177 --> 27:37.439
Can I call you a cab?
- Sure. Whatever.

27:38.111 --> 27:39.917
Good night, Toby.
- Good night.

27:40.573 --> 27:41.465
Hey, good night.

28:41.193 --> 28:41.970
Tom!

28:42.516 --> 28:43.724
Tom, it's me!

28:44.902 --> 28:45.890
Toby.

28:47.367 --> 28:48.495
Where you following me?

28:49.089 --> 28:51.037
I know what you did, man.
I know about the fires.

28:52.681 --> 28:53.837
What the hell are you talking about?

28:54.615 --> 28:56.179
I know you set the fires.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.351
You want to be a big hero.

28:59.257 --> 29:01.226
Yeah, you probably burned this
building too. You're reliving it, man.

29:02.735 --> 29:05.566
You get off on it.
- I didn't start any damn fires!

29:09.500 --> 29:10.742
Then why the hell are you here?

29:21.291 --> 29:23.138
Because this is where it happened.

29:27.692 --> 29:28.786
There was a girl.

29:29.641 --> 29:31.064
Help!

29:33.086 --> 29:34.063
She needed me.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.343
I couldn't move.

29:42.436 --> 29:43.397
You froze.

29:46.138 --> 29:47.919
I'm afraid I'll do it again.

29:52.247 --> 29:54.721
You tell anybody about
this and I'll kick your ass.

30:02.190 --> 30:02.987
Hey.

30:04.656 --> 30:07.533
What do you want, Toby?
- I just wanna say I'm sorry.

30:08.518 --> 30:09.909
Fine, whatever.

30:10.328 --> 30:12.968
No, I saw you with someone
and I acted like an idiot.

30:13.626 --> 30:14.734
Yeah, well you had company.

30:15.227 --> 30:17.612
Yeah, well, for what it's worth,
Tom's probably a good guy.

30:18.131 --> 30:19.292
He's just going through some stuff.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.790
Thanks, but I don't need your approval.

30:22.144 --> 30:23.148
Guess that's true.

30:24.775 --> 30:27.409
Look at that, Kyle found Vince’s ex.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.883
I did, actually. Had to twist his arm,
but he finally coughed up her number.

30:33.364 --> 30:34.445
How did you do that?

30:35.816 --> 30:38.095
I convinced him that,
no matter what he'd done,

30:38.254 --> 30:41.095
how bad he'd messed up in the past,
I'm sure that she cared about him.

30:52.701 --> 30:54.453
Here you go. Thanks.

30:55.299 --> 30:57.299
I'll be out for the rest of the day.
- You got a date?

31:00.673 --> 31:02.816
You're wearing Hugo and a new shirt.

31:03.551 --> 31:04.487
Where are you taking her?

31:07.277 --> 31:08.169
"Susur".

31:08.675 --> 31:11.280
"Susur"? This is what, your third date now?

31:13.355 --> 31:14.886
You've still got Richter’s' file.

31:16.597 --> 31:18.252
Yeah, one last look before I turn it over.

31:18.566 --> 31:20.439
You've got other cases. So move on, Charlie.

31:21.054 --> 31:22.744
Will do. First thing in
the morning, I promise.

31:23.252 --> 31:24.129
Okay.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.065
Okay, we've got one more eval.

31:30.293 --> 31:33.628
Full run through of CPR cardiac arrest
for choking. Should be easy, peasy.

31:33.824 --> 31:36.043
We do this by the book, no improvising.

31:36.857 --> 31:37.777
Alright.

31:37.845 --> 31:41.105
We've got an hour till Ryder
shows up to run through this stuff.

31:41.731 --> 31:43.218
It'll be a piece of cake.
- Sounds good, man.

31:44.247 --> 31:46.862
Hey, are you with me on this, or what?
Dude, you're not even dressed.

31:47.288 --> 31:50.077
Hey, we need this one. Otherwise we're
gonna be manning the geriatric rickshaw.

31:50.857 --> 31:55.183
Sorry, man. I was just thinking about Vince.
You know, growing up in foster care.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.294
A few different choices,
that could've been me in the hospital.

31:57.419 --> 31:59.075
Yeah, but you made the right choices. He didn't.

31:59.559 --> 32:00.889
Eventually people get what's coming to them.

32:03.827 --> 32:06.642
Sorry, I know you knew the dude. But you play
with meth, you're gonna get burned.

32:07.476 --> 32:09.110
Sometimes innocent victims
aren't so innocent.

32:10.628 --> 32:12.320
Probably got what he deserved anyway.

32:13.643 --> 32:15.119
Hey, Toby. How are you?

32:15.369 --> 32:17.714
Good, Ray. What are you doing here?
- I had a consultation in the hospital.

32:17.998 --> 32:21.808
Hey, actually, I could use a consultation myself.
- Uhuh, what's bothering you?

32:22.788 --> 32:26.081
Well, I've been getting a lot of weird hits lately.
What do you know about arsonists?

32:26.698 --> 32:29.058
Serial arsonists.
- Well, they have their own profile.

32:29.149 --> 32:32.183
Often male, under stress,

32:32.618 --> 32:34.399
difficulty forming relationships,

32:34.528 --> 32:36.609
Need for empowerment.
- Well, how does that work?

32:37.049 --> 32:38.674
They like the attention, the excitement.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.644
And some of them do it because they
actually think they're making things better.

32:42.465 --> 32:45.590
They're improving things?
- Fire clears the undergrowth.

32:45.684 --> 32:47.839
Probably our first weapon after the club.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.529
Thanks, Ray.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.249
You know where to find me.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.940
Hey, where are you going?
- I gotta go check something out.

32:54.032 --> 32:55.921
You'll be back in an hour though, right?

33:45.558 --> 33:46.374
Kyle.

33:48.781 --> 33:49.688
Hey.

33:49.779 --> 33:50.966
How did you know I was here?

33:51.894 --> 33:53.438
The hospital told me you moved.

33:55.979 --> 33:58.416
Just put the knife down, alright? It's over.

34:04.616 --> 34:05.668
It's not over.

34:05.927 --> 34:07.270
It'll never be over.

34:08.661 --> 34:12.960
But, what would you know? All these victims.
You just bring them in and drop them off.

34:14.273 --> 34:15.744
You don't know anything about them. I know.

34:16.710 --> 34:19.107
Vics like Tyler Moss. This fifteen year
old kid. Smart, he's pretty funny.

34:20.219 --> 34:22.768
Walking home, he was run
over by a drunk driver.

34:22.876 --> 34:26.031
He's paralyzed from the neck down.
Same day, Sara Martin...

34:26.712 --> 34:29.210
Stabbed in the stomach by her boyfriend.

34:29.658 --> 34:32.714
She didn't wanna press charges because
she didn't want him to get in trouble.

34:33.003 --> 34:35.511
Yeah, a month later she's dead.
There's complications.

34:36.396 --> 34:38.112
There are hundreds and hundreds.

34:38.349 --> 34:41.882
All these people, beaten and
robbed, raped by their loved ones.

34:41.944 --> 34:45.344
Again and again. And well,
you know what happens.

34:45.907 --> 34:47.213
Nothing.
- Nothing.

34:47.924 --> 34:51.752
There's no charges. No arrests.
Nothing that even comes close to justice.

34:53.193 --> 34:54.214
We can get you help.

34:55.971 --> 35:00.101
Oh, no. I, I, I, I'm not the one that needs help.
They're the ones who need help.

35:02.481 --> 35:04.903
I'm not gonna be the one who just
sits around anymore and listens.

35:05.413 --> 35:08.297
But you hurt those people, Kyle.
- Only the ones who needed to pay.

35:08.711 --> 35:11.333
That's not up to you. It's not.

35:11.813 --> 35:13.827
No. I had to do it.

35:14.425 --> 35:15.820
And I've done it again.

35:18.223 --> 35:19.256
There's another one?

35:23.927 --> 35:24.831
Where is it, Kyle?

35:29.979 --> 35:31.664
People need to pay!

35:33.680 --> 35:34.398
Kyle!

35:55.972 --> 35:58.730
Back up, people! People back up!

36:00.007 --> 36:01.238
Clear the area, please. Thank you.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.759
Oz.
- Toby, where the hell are you?

36:03.610 --> 36:04.851
Ryder's all over my ass over here.

36:04.942 --> 36:06.799
Oz, where's that building
with the red-blue carpet?

36:07.949 --> 36:08.729
What? What carpet?

36:08.896 --> 36:12.368
You know, the one that, the carpet that made
you dizzy when we picked up that cardiac arrest?

36:16.231 --> 36:17.837
Okay, meet me there
with the rig and call Fire.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.265
Logan! What the hell is going on?

36:30.355 --> 36:32.131
We've got to get everyone out of here.
There's gonna be another fire.

36:33.398 --> 36:35.179
I'll go to the top floor,
start getting people out of here.

36:43.559 --> 36:44.450
Hello!

36:47.713 --> 36:48.650
Hey!

37:05.963 --> 37:07.412
Don't move! Stay there!

37:07.504 --> 37:09.571
Toby. Come on, let's go.

37:14.375 --> 37:15.432
There's a girl down the hall.

37:15.890 --> 37:16.978
I got this.

37:18.314 --> 37:19.104
Let's go.

37:50.304 --> 37:51.540
There you go.

38:05.184 --> 38:06.689
Vince, are you sure you've
got a place to stay?

38:07.217 --> 38:09.064
He's gonna be crashing with
me 'till he finds a place.

38:09.632 --> 38:10.971
I have a really comfy couch for him.

38:13.278 --> 38:16.539
Well, it looks like the cops are off my ass, so I'll be
getting some insurance money out of this whole thing.

38:17.430 --> 38:19.914
That's good, 'cause next time
we go out, drinks are on you.

38:20.248 --> 38:21.822
You got it. Thanks, man.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.023
Sure.
- I'll call you.

38:24.330 --> 38:27.894
Yeah, I look forward to it. Take care
of yourself. Take care of her too, alright?

38:41.167 --> 38:42.208
Hey.
- Hey.

38:42.326 --> 38:43.252
What are you doing here?

38:43.825 --> 38:46.391
I thought you might want to know that
we connected Kyle to five more fires.

38:46.482 --> 38:47.736
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:47.786 --> 38:50.475
It seems the target in each case was
someone we had arrested before

38:50.507 --> 38:51.808
but just couldn't put a case against them.

38:52.788 --> 38:54.412
Kind of like your buddy, Vince Pirell.

38:54.974 --> 38:55.904
That's messed up.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.868
Guess you're not the only one who thought
the police couldn't do their work.

39:00.559 --> 39:02.476
So, tell me, how did you know about that last fire?

39:03.290 --> 39:04.634
I could smell the smoke.

39:05.314 --> 39:07.828
You were just walking by. You could smell it.

39:07.829 --> 39:09.345
Yeah, I was walking by.

39:11.632 --> 39:14.305
Next time, call the fire department.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
