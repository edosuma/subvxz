WEBVTT

03:17.311 --> 03:18.548
Okay, thanks.

03:28.357 --> 03:29.592
Hi.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.761
Veronica.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.430
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thanks for taking the time.

03:34.463 --> 03:36.633
Hey, of course.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.868
I just got an email from
one of our older parishioners.

03:38.901 --> 03:41.471
She was wanting to know
what her cut was going to be

03:41.504 --> 03:44.642
from the sale
of her deceased husband's books,

03:44.676 --> 03:48.512
which I thought she'd donated
to the church rummage sale.

03:48.545 --> 03:52.850
So, I, uh, gotta figure out
how to deal with that.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.487
Sounds complicated.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.290
Uh, please, have a seat.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.024
Thanks.

03:59.058 --> 04:03.062
Sorry. I'm a little nervous,
this is a little bit...

04:03.094 --> 04:04.929
My condolences.

04:04.963 --> 04:08.468
I'm extremely sorry
for your loss.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.637
Thank you,
that's very kind.

04:20.514 --> 04:23.451
As I mentioned on the phone,
it's um...

04:23.483 --> 04:26.787
it is unusual that your father
would have insisted on services

04:26.820 --> 04:29.924
and a funeral here.

04:29.958 --> 04:32.660
- I understand.
- Right.

04:32.693 --> 04:36.497
So I take it
he never visited the church?

04:36.530 --> 04:38.866
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Right.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.105
So that makes it
a little unusual.

04:42.137 --> 04:44.740
Though, of course,
we can fulfill this final wish,

04:44.774 --> 04:47.810
we'd be more than happy to.

04:47.843 --> 04:49.445
Great.

04:49.478 --> 04:52.514
But, um...
I'm glad that we could meet,

04:52.548 --> 04:55.719
I just think it's important
we spend some time so that...

04:55.753 --> 04:58.789
so that you can give me
a sense of who he was.

04:58.822 --> 05:00.491
That way, I can say
some words about him

05:00.524 --> 05:02.493
for the service,
if that's all right.

05:02.525 --> 05:04.127
Okay.

05:04.161 --> 05:10.402
So, while we think he might not
have been a churchgoer, um...

05:10.434 --> 05:12.470
well, is there anything that
you might wanna have mentioned

05:12.504 --> 05:15.874
about his spiritual path?

05:15.906 --> 05:18.377
Spiritual path?

05:20.478 --> 05:25.017
Um... whatever made him
special to you.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.458
A lot of things
made him special.

06:13.636 --> 06:17.441
I found this in my rice.

06:17.473 --> 06:18.943
You need to wear
something on your head

06:18.976 --> 06:21.446
to protect your hair
from falling in the food.

06:21.479 --> 06:23.181
It's not my hair.

06:24.681 --> 06:25.949
There are rules.

06:25.983 --> 06:28.653
We're talking about a code.

06:28.685 --> 06:31.489
What's your name?

06:31.523 --> 06:33.892
- Lisa.
- Hmm.

06:33.924 --> 06:36.694
Employees working
in food preparation

06:36.727 --> 06:40.031
need to wear a cap
or a hairnet, you see?

06:40.064 --> 06:42.734
I am a food inspector.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.703
Now, it's all right,
this is a private meal,

06:44.736 --> 06:46.205
you're not in trouble, Lisa.

06:46.238 --> 06:49.608
The idea is to stop people
from finding hair in their food.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.810
It's not hygienic, is it?

07:59.850 --> 08:02.654
<i>What, so he would have worked
for the city?</i>

08:02.688 --> 08:04.089
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:04.121 --> 08:07.661
<i>Go to the restaurants, um...</i>

08:07.694 --> 08:09.729
<i>see if the food was okay,</i>

08:09.762 --> 08:12.132
<i>people were wearing hairnets.</i>

08:12.165 --> 08:16.069
- <i>Right.</i>
- <i>Make sure it was clean.</i>

08:16.101 --> 08:18.338
- <i>Stuff like that.</i>
- <i>Mm.</i>

08:18.371 --> 08:21.308
<i>Always making sure
things were up to code,</i>

08:21.342 --> 08:23.945
<i>not contaminated.</i>

08:23.977 --> 08:26.347
It was all about
the contamination, for him.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.317
It seems like one of those
people that you, uh...

08:29.349 --> 08:33.120
that you kind of hear about
but you never actually see.

08:41.196 --> 08:43.099
Enjoy.

08:45.735 --> 08:48.303
Yes, sir,
are you here for lunch?

08:48.337 --> 08:50.907
Could I speak to the operator
of the restaurant?

08:50.939 --> 08:52.674
- I am the operator.
- Right.

08:52.707 --> 08:55.179
It's a customary check,
Health Services.

08:55.212 --> 08:57.213
There's no need
to stop what you're doing.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.849
- This is our busiest time.
- Yes, I understand that.

08:59.882 --> 09:03.353
You want to show the kitchen
or shall I make my own way?

09:12.997 --> 09:15.199
All bottles
and storage containers

09:15.233 --> 09:18.237
need to be clearly identified,
right?

09:18.269 --> 09:20.205
- Okay, so...
- Now, that's for the safety

09:20.239 --> 09:23.008
of your workers,
not to mention the customers.

09:26.445 --> 09:28.381
Yes, I'm perfectly aware
of that.

09:28.413 --> 09:30.683
But everything made in here
goes out there,

09:30.716 --> 09:32.718
and that's who I'm here
to protect.

10:09.157 --> 10:10.392
You're working
in a restaurant!

10:10.426 --> 10:14.164
Wash your hands!

10:14.196 --> 10:16.099
What is "conditional"?

10:16.132 --> 10:18.234
Well, it means
what it says.

10:28.077 --> 10:31.382
Yes, I'm very impressed
for a new establishment.

10:31.416 --> 10:34.419
So, uh...
we got a good rating?

10:34.452 --> 10:38.255
Yep, you've done
a wonderful job.

10:38.288 --> 10:40.258
Thank you!

10:40.291 --> 10:43.763
Thank you, thank you.

10:43.795 --> 10:44.797
You're welcome.

10:46.866 --> 10:48.366
I'll just need
to sign this certificate

10:48.400 --> 10:50.269
so you can put it in...

11:53.470 --> 11:56.908
Right, are you sure
about this, Veronica?

11:56.941 --> 11:58.509
Because once you give
an animal a name,

11:58.542 --> 12:02.346
it can't be changed,
it's very bad luck.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.819
What are you telling her now?

12:05.852 --> 12:07.821
I'm just telling her
the simple truth.

12:07.854 --> 12:10.556
<i>You can only give an animal
one name.</i>

12:10.589 --> 12:13.158
<i>Once it's uttered
from your lips,</i>

12:13.191 --> 12:15.828
<i>that's what it will always be.</i>

12:15.862 --> 12:17.965
<i>Right? So here we go.</i>

12:17.998 --> 12:22.102
<i>Now is the moment of truth,</i>

12:22.134 --> 12:26.373
<i>and the bunny's name is...</i>

12:26.406 --> 12:31.146
- <i>Benjamin.</i>
- <i>Ah! Benjamin.</i>

12:31.178 --> 12:35.616
<i>Does this mean I can't serve
rabbit at my restaurant?</i>

12:35.649 --> 12:39.154
<i>Don't look at me like that!</i>

12:52.267 --> 12:54.604
<i>Does this mean you want me
to work at your restaurant?</i>

12:54.637 --> 12:57.306
<i>No, let's open something new.</i>

12:57.339 --> 12:59.008
<i>I'm sure you parents
would love to invest</i>

12:59.041 --> 13:01.377
<i>in a Brazilian restaurant.</i>

13:01.411 --> 13:04.381
<i>Well, actually,
this is a Portuguese dish.</i>

13:04.414 --> 13:06.084
<i>Okay. So we'll make
my second restaurant</i>

13:06.117 --> 13:08.051
<i>a Brazilian-Portuguese
fusion</i>

13:08.085 --> 13:10.054
and name it after you.

13:10.086 --> 13:12.489
Roseangela.

13:12.522 --> 13:17.528
Beautiful name for the most
beautiful woman in the world.

13:17.562 --> 13:19.597
Mm-hm-hm.

13:19.630 --> 13:23.635
It's true,
I'm the luckiest man alive.

13:23.668 --> 13:27.105
If you only knew
how happy I feel right now.

15:01.373 --> 15:03.377
<i>See, I'm just trying
to get as much of a sense</i>

15:03.410 --> 15:06.748
<i>of who he was
in the brief time that I have.</i>

15:06.781 --> 15:08.181
<i>Was there anything
about his work</i>

15:08.215 --> 15:09.584
<i>that you'd like to mention?</i>

15:09.617 --> 15:11.285
<i>Like what?</i>

15:11.317 --> 15:13.388
<i>You know, that he was
respected by his peers.</i>

15:13.421 --> 15:16.456
<i>I never met
any of his co-workers.</i>

15:16.489 --> 15:18.059
He kept to himself a lot,

15:18.092 --> 15:20.395
especially after my mom died.

15:20.428 --> 15:22.230
They met in England.

15:22.264 --> 15:24.198
That's where he's from,

15:24.231 --> 15:25.767
and my mom's Brazilian.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.603
Raised here.

15:27.635 --> 15:33.142
My mother's parents gave
a lot of money to the church.

15:33.175 --> 15:35.678
It was important to them.

15:40.582 --> 15:42.420
Um...

15:44.454 --> 15:47.492
How many people are
you expecting at the funeral?

15:49.358 --> 15:52.062
It's hard to say, I...

15:52.096 --> 15:53.598
He used to own a restaurant,

15:53.631 --> 15:55.434
but that was a long time ago.

15:55.466 --> 15:57.201
And that would have been prior
to his having become

15:57.234 --> 15:59.236
a health inspector?

15:59.270 --> 16:00.539
Yeah.

16:03.407 --> 16:06.211
I don't know why he did that,
that was an odd choice.

16:06.244 --> 16:08.614
Yeah.

16:08.647 --> 16:12.652
He made a lot of odd choices.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.462
He's looking really tired.

17:23.493 --> 17:25.463
Is he drinking enough water?

17:25.497 --> 17:28.701
He's 15 years old, Veronica,
that's ancient for a rabbit.

17:30.603 --> 17:32.906
Do you remember
all the ribbons

17:32.939 --> 17:34.841
he used to win
in the pet fair?

17:34.874 --> 17:36.843
Mm, yeah.

17:36.876 --> 17:39.212
Where are those?

17:39.244 --> 17:40.813
In my desk.

17:44.451 --> 17:46.720
I'll see if I can find them.

17:46.752 --> 17:50.758
Top drawer,
way in the back.

17:57.898 --> 17:59.700
I was wondering
if you'd had a chance

17:59.734 --> 18:02.736
- to speak to your lawyer.
- About what?

18:02.770 --> 18:05.374
Early release.

18:05.407 --> 18:10.279
But I don't want
an early release, Dad.

18:10.312 --> 18:12.481
You know that.

18:12.514 --> 18:16.452
No one decides
to stay in jail.

18:16.485 --> 18:18.854
- I have.
- Why?

18:18.888 --> 18:21.491
Because.

18:21.524 --> 18:24.361
It's what I deserve.

18:24.393 --> 18:26.563
After what I did.

18:28.331 --> 18:30.235
Clive?

18:30.267 --> 18:31.501
Clive, I told everyone,

18:31.535 --> 18:32.970
leave your phones on the bus,

18:33.004 --> 18:37.507
on your seats, no distractions,
come on, let's go.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.012
I gotta bring this back
all the way inside,

18:41.045 --> 18:42.715
- is that it?
- Yep.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.415
That's right. Mike will be here
the whole time,

18:44.449 --> 18:46.252
and if he leaves,
the door will be locked.

18:46.285 --> 18:47.753
You can leave your phone
by mine in the front

18:47.786 --> 18:50.789
if you're too tired
to walk all the way back.

18:53.860 --> 18:56.329
Guard this with your life,
would you?

18:56.362 --> 18:57.864
Like you're guarding
her phone

18:57.896 --> 19:00.466
and all the other
fuckin' phones in this place.

19:36.806 --> 19:38.540
There's no way.

19:38.574 --> 19:39.842
Yeah, just watch.

19:39.875 --> 19:40.843
Yeah?

19:40.876 --> 19:43.414
Yep. We'll do it.

19:43.446 --> 19:44.948
That's for sure.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.899
What time we gotta be back
on the bus for again?

20:01.933 --> 20:03.667
Uh...

20:03.701 --> 20:07.973
we have an hour for dinner
before we need to leave.

20:08.005 --> 20:10.508
You wanna join me?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.378
Where's everyone going?

20:12.410 --> 20:14.714
Wouldn't be everybody,
it'd just be the two of us.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.585
That wouldn't be
such a good idea, Clive.

20:19.619 --> 20:20.754
Why not?

20:27.861 --> 20:31.666
Because I'm...
I'm having dinner with Mike.

20:31.699 --> 20:34.035
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.402
Seriously.

20:44.412 --> 20:45.580
<i>I don't get it.</i>

20:45.613 --> 20:47.516
You don't want to be here.

20:47.548 --> 20:49.617
No.

20:49.651 --> 20:54.524
No, I'm just saying
the reason I came over was...

20:54.556 --> 20:58.827
Clive had asked me out
and I needed an excuse.

20:58.861 --> 21:01.164
Which is dinner with me.

21:01.197 --> 21:02.732
Yeah.

21:02.765 --> 21:03.967
'Cause otherwise,
you would have been

21:03.999 --> 21:05.869
forced to have dinner with him.

21:05.903 --> 21:09.073
But I never would.

21:09.106 --> 21:11.875
'Cause he's a student.

21:11.909 --> 21:14.011
Obviously.

21:14.044 --> 21:16.046
So I guess I don't have
to pay for the meal, huh?

21:22.220 --> 21:24.655
So he's attracted to you.

21:24.689 --> 21:27.125
That's not the point.

21:27.157 --> 21:29.061
Of course it is.

21:32.665 --> 21:35.201
What do you mean?

21:35.233 --> 21:36.802
He wouldn't have asked you out

21:36.836 --> 21:39.172
if he didn't think
you were attractive.

21:39.204 --> 21:41.774
- Does it matter?
- Doesn't it?

21:41.808 --> 21:45.512
Doesn't it make you feel good?

21:45.544 --> 21:47.447
Why would it make me
feel good, Mike?

21:47.481 --> 21:49.883
You know, there's nothing wrong
with feeling good.

21:49.916 --> 21:52.653
Good about yourself,
you know.

21:52.685 --> 21:54.555
Havin' fun.

21:54.589 --> 21:59.860
I'm not saying it's easy,
but...

21:59.894 --> 22:02.664
You know, I feel good
when I listen to your music.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.801
It's so beautiful.

22:12.107 --> 22:13.976
We're two adults
chaperoning these students

22:14.008 --> 22:17.079
on a band trip.

22:18.111 --> 22:18.981
I'm no chaperone.

22:19.015 --> 22:21.217
I'm a bus driver.

22:21.250 --> 22:25.054
My job is over
when I turn the engine off.

22:25.088 --> 22:27.624
Nah, this is just
a part-time job for me

22:27.657 --> 22:29.126
while I figure out my life.

22:29.159 --> 22:31.528
For you, it's easy...
I mean,

22:31.562 --> 22:34.532
you're the hot young teacher.

22:34.564 --> 22:39.202
There was one at my school,
I mean, wow, she was...

22:39.236 --> 22:41.006
Aww, please...
no, sit down, please,

22:41.038 --> 22:44.175
I didn't mean to...

22:44.209 --> 22:46.178
It's okay, Mike.

22:49.814 --> 22:53.786
This hot young teacher
needs to cool herself down.

22:53.818 --> 22:57.590
Okay, all right,
not even talking.

23:32.962 --> 23:35.231
Send it.

23:35.263 --> 23:37.733
Yeah, she got it.

23:48.978 --> 23:51.614
Wouldn't it be nice

23:51.647 --> 23:56.087
if nothing actually happened
with those boys, Dad?

23:56.120 --> 24:00.625
If those texts were sent
by somebody else?

24:00.658 --> 24:03.360
If I did all of this because

24:03.393 --> 24:07.332
this is where I needed to be?

24:12.236 --> 24:16.140
I don't understand, love.

24:16.174 --> 24:18.945
Try, Dad.

24:18.977 --> 24:23.048
I know you can.

24:23.082 --> 24:26.352
You're not suggesting...

24:31.392 --> 24:33.361
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello, this is Jim Davis.

24:33.393 --> 24:35.630
I'm here with
my daughter, Veronica.

24:35.662 --> 24:37.664
We're a little early,
I'm afraid.

24:37.698 --> 24:39.233
<i>Oh, that's okay.</i>

24:39.266 --> 24:41.202
<i>You can wait
in the piano room downstairs.</i>

24:41.236 --> 24:42.838
<i>I'm just finishing
a lesson with my son</i>

24:42.871 --> 24:44.773
<i>on the second floor.</i>

24:44.806 --> 24:48.276
<i>Or, actually, come on up,
if you want.</i>

24:57.153 --> 25:00.390
So you want to keep your hands
very light,

25:00.423 --> 25:02.992
loosen the wrists.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.397
Hi.

25:06.430 --> 25:08.032
I'm Alicia.

25:08.065 --> 25:09.866
- Jim Davis.
- Nice to meet you.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.435
- This is my daughter, Veronica.
- Hi, Veronica.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.104
Hi.

25:14.136 --> 25:16.707
This is my son, Walter.

25:16.741 --> 25:19.778
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.812
Well, that's a beautiful
instrument, isn't it?

25:21.846 --> 25:24.749
You ever seen
anything like that?

25:24.781 --> 25:27.952
So the lessons will actually
take place downstairs.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.222
I just... I didn't quite
understand the setup, Alicia.

25:30.254 --> 25:32.691
- Is it...
- Sorry, it's Ali-sha.

25:32.724 --> 25:34.426
Oh, sorry, Alicia.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.162
Have you got
two apartments?

25:36.195 --> 25:39.130
Well, the woman downstairs
rents from me...

25:39.164 --> 25:41.435
Oh, I see; that's why
you call it a piano room.

27:58.983 --> 28:00.418
Here's a thing
you can say about my dad.

28:00.450 --> 28:01.986
- Okay.
- You can tell everyone

28:02.018 --> 28:05.289
how he helped look after
my rabbit.

28:05.323 --> 28:07.359
It died.

28:07.391 --> 28:11.996
Just before my father
found out he was so sick.

28:16.267 --> 28:18.036
And what was its name?

28:18.070 --> 28:20.640
- His name.
- Excuse me, his name.

28:20.672 --> 28:22.174
Benjamin.

28:22.208 --> 28:24.009
Benjamin Bunny.

28:24.043 --> 28:26.079
That's nice.

28:26.112 --> 28:28.247
I was nine
when I got him.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.883
Nine?

28:29.916 --> 28:31.651
And how old was Benjamin?

28:31.684 --> 28:35.121
Almost 16.

28:35.154 --> 28:37.156
So rabbits live that long?

28:37.190 --> 28:38.592
Yeah.

28:38.624 --> 28:42.062
They can... the oldest one
on record is 17, so...

28:42.095 --> 28:44.164
that's something
you can definitely say

28:44.198 --> 28:45.934
about my father.

28:45.967 --> 28:48.036
He was so good
at looking after my rabbit.

28:48.068 --> 28:49.270
Whenever I'd go away,

28:49.304 --> 28:52.073
I'd leave Benjamin
with my dad.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.542
Last time was quite a while.

28:54.576 --> 28:56.612
And where were you?

28:56.645 --> 28:58.981
I was in jail.

29:31.282 --> 29:34.352
<i>I woke up this morning</i>

29:34.386 --> 29:42.195
<i>to find that we have outlived
the myth of trust.</i>

29:42.227 --> 29:45.731
<i>You woke up this morning</i>

29:45.764 --> 29:47.333
<i>to the fact
we've lost the things</i>

29:47.367 --> 29:52.172
<i>we took for granted
between us.</i>

29:52.205 --> 29:56.310
<i>...will still
fall off the tree.</i>

29:56.342 --> 30:00.514
<i>When you're in as deep
as we are, honey,</i>

30:00.546 --> 30:05.019
<i>it's so easy
to get washed out to sea.</i>

30:05.053 --> 30:09.391
<i>For the facts of life
are not man and wife,</i>

30:09.423 --> 30:14.128
<i>but man and woman, sadly.</i>

30:14.161 --> 30:18.300
<i>And the apple that doesn't
want to get eaten</i>

30:18.334 --> 30:24.708
<i>will still fall off the tree.</i>

30:51.435 --> 30:54.406
<i>I woke up this morning</i>

30:54.440 --> 31:01.414
<i>to find that we have outlived
the myth of trust.</i>

32:07.184 --> 32:09.353
I just...

32:09.387 --> 32:14.159
watched the flames
and walked away, I think.

32:33.913 --> 32:37.217
Walter?

32:37.249 --> 32:39.619
Walter! Oh!

32:53.367 --> 32:55.503
<i>I'm leaving this on
your phone.</i>

32:55.537 --> 32:58.207
<i>You don't need
to show anyone.</i>

32:58.240 --> 33:01.309
<i>All these years
that I've adored you,</i>

33:01.343 --> 33:03.746
<i>given you my love.</i>

33:05.848 --> 33:07.250
Is that what I get in return

33:07.282 --> 33:08.251
for you telling me
about what happened

33:08.283 --> 33:11.187
with my mom in the fire?

33:11.221 --> 33:13.557
<i>And then,
did you let us get this close</i>

33:13.589 --> 33:15.958
<i>just so you could tell me?</i>

33:15.992 --> 33:18.495
<i>Now this is why
you want to break up?</i>

33:18.529 --> 33:20.598
<i>Leave me?</i>

33:20.630 --> 33:24.267
Do you feel better
about yourself now?

33:24.301 --> 33:27.571
Now that you've told me the
truth that I have to live with?

33:27.605 --> 33:29.841
<i>Except the joke is on you,
Veronica.</i>

33:29.873 --> 33:33.344
<i>I'm not gonna live with this.</i>

33:33.378 --> 33:35.480
'Cause I'm gonna join my mom

33:35.513 --> 33:39.584
in whatever underworld
you put her in.

34:11.886 --> 34:16.559
<i>Till the crowds are...</i>

34:16.592 --> 34:20.695
<i>Followed in the...</i>

34:27.001 --> 34:29.639
<i>Is it you I'm talking to?</i>

34:29.672 --> 34:33.409
<i>But my reflection
in the wind...</i>

34:39.049 --> 34:40.485
You're kidding me, man.

34:53.031 --> 34:54.800
What's up?

34:54.831 --> 34:56.400
Two of the kids,

34:56.435 --> 34:58.638
they're fucking
in the room beside me.

35:00.705 --> 35:04.877
Is one of them married?

35:04.911 --> 35:06.579
Why would you say that?

35:06.612 --> 35:08.748
What are you suggesting
we do, Mike?

35:08.781 --> 35:10.549
Knock down the door,
barge in there,

35:10.583 --> 35:14.421
see if it's all okay?

35:14.453 --> 35:17.724
Why do you make me
feel like this?

35:17.758 --> 35:18.993
Like what?

35:19.026 --> 35:20.594
Like I'm stupid.

35:20.626 --> 35:22.662
I'm just trying
to see the situation

35:22.695 --> 35:24.764
for what it is.

35:24.798 --> 35:26.434
They're teenagers.

35:26.466 --> 35:28.937
There are rules, but...

35:32.406 --> 35:36.344
Yeah, you're right, um...
the walls are thin.

35:36.377 --> 35:39.647
I was just trying
to play my music.

35:39.681 --> 35:42.418
I understand.

35:42.450 --> 35:43.785
Can I come in?

35:43.818 --> 35:46.355
I wanna talk to you
about something.

35:46.389 --> 35:48.858
What?

35:48.890 --> 35:49.992
Is he bothering you?

35:50.025 --> 35:51.793
I notice
he's sending you texts.

35:51.827 --> 35:53.797
How... how would you know that?

35:53.830 --> 35:56.667
Um, on the bus, all right,
I notice things.

35:59.069 --> 36:01.538
It's about the music.

36:01.571 --> 36:04.876
The texts,
they're about the music.

36:06.978 --> 36:08.113
Good night.

36:26.131 --> 36:28.835
It's not possible.

36:28.867 --> 36:31.938
Are you saying
it's not your restaurant?

36:31.971 --> 36:33.773
Clearly the same place.

36:33.806 --> 36:35.509
I've never had rats here.

36:35.541 --> 36:36.675
Well, perhaps
you've never looked.

36:36.708 --> 36:38.611
Can I see your kitchen?

36:40.613 --> 36:42.149
Someone brought that rat in

36:42.182 --> 36:43.784
and let him loose.

36:43.818 --> 36:45.720
Really?

36:45.752 --> 36:47.622
You know someone who would do
something like that?

36:47.655 --> 36:49.156
I do.

36:49.189 --> 36:51.425
People are jealous.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.961
Yes.

36:52.994 --> 36:54.829
Certainly, some people are.

36:54.862 --> 36:56.799
It would be rather
an extreme thing to do, though,

36:56.831 --> 36:58.500
wouldn't it?

36:58.532 --> 37:01.436
It is. Maybe this
isn't so anonymous.

37:02.603 --> 37:06.108
Ah, there we go.

37:09.211 --> 37:11.514
It's not possible.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.687
Jesus Christ.

37:16.719 --> 37:17.888
That's fresh.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.489
Someone put them there.

37:19.522 --> 37:21.791
- By bringing in a rat.
- Yes!

37:21.824 --> 37:23.560
All right, let's assume
that that's what happened.

37:23.594 --> 37:25.896
- It is what happened.
- I'm just saying that...

37:25.929 --> 37:27.831
- Luigi, is it?
- Yes.

37:27.864 --> 37:30.701
The combination of that video
that someone sent in and this

37:30.735 --> 37:33.472
means I'm gonna have
to close you down.

37:35.773 --> 37:37.108
Are you gonna put that
on your notice?

37:37.140 --> 37:39.744
- What?
- That you found a rat?

37:39.776 --> 37:42.714
That someone put a fuckin' rat
in my restaurant?

37:42.748 --> 37:46.118
- My customers...
- Oh, Luigi, look.

37:46.150 --> 37:47.953
Look.

37:47.986 --> 37:49.654
If there were anyone here,

37:49.687 --> 37:52.558
I'd have to ask you
to get them to leave.

37:52.592 --> 37:53.894
Please.

37:53.927 --> 37:55.629
- I am begging you.
- If they're truly loyal,

37:55.662 --> 37:57.698
- they'll understand.
- I know my customers.

37:57.731 --> 37:58.799
They won't come back.

37:58.831 --> 38:01.634
- Not after this.
- Listen.

38:01.668 --> 38:03.769
I'm going to give you a list

38:03.802 --> 38:06.006
of government-approved
exterminators

38:06.040 --> 38:07.609
so you can get on to this
right away,

38:07.642 --> 38:09.176
and I don't normally do that.

38:09.209 --> 38:12.980
But someone put a fuckin' rat
in my restaurant.

38:13.013 --> 38:14.716
You seem very certain
about this.

38:14.748 --> 38:18.086
I know exactly who it was.

38:21.657 --> 38:23.025
I can give you their name,

38:23.057 --> 38:25.193
I can give you their number.

38:27.028 --> 38:29.131
Right.

38:29.165 --> 38:30.667
If that is the case,

38:30.700 --> 38:32.035
you need to go
directly to the police

38:32.068 --> 38:33.669
and tell them.

38:33.703 --> 38:35.138
And don't put the blame
on yourself.

38:35.171 --> 38:36.705
That's the worst thing
you could do,

38:36.738 --> 38:39.808
that's what they want you to do.

38:39.841 --> 38:43.813
Whoever did this,
you need to strike back.

40:14.844 --> 40:16.081
Oh, God.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.258
Yeah, man, that was great.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.795
Thank you.

40:28.828 --> 40:31.130
Congratulations.
Nicely done.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.169
Can I talk to you
about something?

40:37.203 --> 40:39.139
About what?

40:39.172 --> 40:42.109
Uh... this.

40:50.984 --> 40:53.088
I didn't send this.

40:53.121 --> 40:55.724
No, I know.

40:55.757 --> 40:59.028
It was sent yesterday while
we were giving the concert.

41:02.362 --> 41:06.369
Which means...

41:06.401 --> 41:08.905
Well, which means
it was sent from the bus,

41:08.937 --> 41:12.240
which is pretty obvious
who it is.

41:12.274 --> 41:14.911
Yeah.

41:14.943 --> 41:17.480
Yeah, I'll...
I'll report him.

41:17.513 --> 41:19.115
No, you don't have
to do that.

41:19.149 --> 41:21.484
Who's gonna drive the bus after?

41:21.518 --> 41:23.020
No, you wouldn't want...

41:23.053 --> 41:24.922
wouldn't want
to cut the tour short.

41:24.955 --> 41:27.758
Right? It could wait.

41:30.193 --> 41:31.762
What do we do until then?

41:37.401 --> 41:38.903
We could hang out.

41:40.272 --> 41:41.774
It's a way
of getting back at him.

41:41.806 --> 41:43.209
It's not a good idea.

41:43.241 --> 41:44.977
Well, he's already
expecting me to react,

41:45.009 --> 41:46.277
tell all my friends.

41:46.310 --> 41:47.345
No, you already
told your friend.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.382
You already told Lenny.

41:51.985 --> 41:54.387
I have 30 witnesses who know
I was conducting a band

41:54.420 --> 41:58.925
at what...
2:45 yesterday afternoon?

41:58.958 --> 42:00.226
I know, yeah,
and they'll know that

42:00.260 --> 42:01.895
when we get back
from the tour,

42:01.927 --> 42:03.864
I thought maybe until then
I'd just act like

42:03.897 --> 42:07.501
I received this text
and I'm okay with it.

42:30.193 --> 42:33.229
- So?
- <i>Is one of them married?</i>

42:33.261 --> 42:35.430
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

43:03.996 --> 43:07.366
We're taking this further.

43:07.398 --> 43:08.534
Further?

43:08.567 --> 43:10.536
Yeah.

43:10.569 --> 43:12.971
It's the only way
I'll go along with this

43:13.005 --> 43:15.175
is if we take it further.

43:18.410 --> 43:20.613
Hey, it's working!
He's coming.

43:20.646 --> 43:22.415
And just like I said, guys,
act like we're having fun,

43:22.448 --> 43:23.450
act like we're having fun.

43:23.483 --> 43:25.419
Woo!

43:25.452 --> 43:26.620
- Woo!
- Woo!

43:28.489 --> 43:30.257
Woo!

43:36.596 --> 43:39.033
<i>Niggas, don't fuck up my vibe.</i>

43:39.065 --> 43:42.938
<i>Been killin' the game and now
I'm actin' like it's mine.</i>

43:42.970 --> 43:44.340
<i>You might fuck her once,</i>

43:44.372 --> 43:46.909
<i>but I can fuck her
all the time.</i>

43:46.941 --> 43:50.579
<i>Everybody dap me up,
I'm thinkin' it's a sign.</i>

43:50.612 --> 43:52.982
<i>I'm the fuckin' man,
if you can't see that,</i>

43:53.015 --> 43:54.517
<i>then you blind.</i>

43:54.549 --> 43:56.218
<i>Rippin' every track, man,</i>

43:56.252 --> 43:58.488
<i>it could never
block my shine.</i>

43:58.520 --> 44:00.223
<i>I cannot afford
to go ghost.</i>

44:00.256 --> 44:01.892
<i>Look at me, swear to God,
I do the most.</i>

44:01.924 --> 44:03.628
<i>I don't ever look
at what you post.</i>

44:03.661 --> 44:05.463
<i>Walked by a group of fans
and everybody froze, whoa.</i>

44:05.496 --> 44:07.465
<i>You can roll a blunt
from my roach.</i>

44:07.498 --> 44:09.367
<i>Really wanna meet me, when
I'm there you can't approach.</i>

44:09.400 --> 44:11.269
<i>Touchin' all the kids
but I'm feelin' like a pope.</i>

44:11.302 --> 44:14.539
<i>Huh, killing your career,
here's a rope.</i>

44:19.977 --> 44:21.613
<i>Walter?</i>

44:21.645 --> 44:23.582
<i>Walter!</i>

44:23.615 --> 44:24.549
<i>This is where
you'll find me.</i>

44:26.517 --> 44:29.588
<i>Blood, mess, and all.</i>

44:29.621 --> 44:33.192
<i>The mess you made
of my life.</i>

44:33.224 --> 44:34.694
<i>Walter?</i>

44:34.726 --> 44:36.362
<i>I want to haunt you,
Veronica.</i>

44:36.395 --> 44:38.498
<i>Walter!</i>

44:42.669 --> 44:44.071
<i>Someday, you may find
a version of me</i>

44:44.104 --> 44:47.073
<i>that you don't destroy.</i>

44:47.106 --> 44:49.009
<i>Walter?</i>

44:53.114 --> 44:54.148
They're your students.

44:54.181 --> 44:55.350
They're fucking kids!

44:55.382 --> 44:57.018
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

44:57.051 --> 44:57.719
<i>I'll become a ghost
from your past.</i>

44:57.752 --> 44:59.487
I wrote that text.

44:59.520 --> 45:01.322
<i>Like you made my mom
a ghost from my past.</i>

45:01.355 --> 45:03.223
I wanted to piss you off,
I wanted to make you honest.

45:03.257 --> 45:04.694
I don't know,
have a conversation!

45:04.727 --> 45:06.729
- I wanna talk to you!
- Don't fuckin' touch me!

45:06.762 --> 45:08.430
- Just fuckin' talk to me!
- Let me in!

45:08.463 --> 45:09.965
Let me in or I'll scream.

45:09.999 --> 45:11.267
I just wanna talk to you,
all right?

45:18.341 --> 45:19.409
Party's over.

45:19.442 --> 45:20.978
Everyone back
in their rooms.

45:21.011 --> 45:22.346
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

45:22.379 --> 45:24.181
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

45:24.214 --> 45:25.181
What the fuck
is wrong with me?

45:25.214 --> 45:26.350
I'll show you.

45:26.382 --> 45:27.651
Hey! Get off! Hey!

45:27.684 --> 45:29.320
Get back in your room,
asshole!

45:29.353 --> 45:31.188
- Get back in your room.
- You're crazy!

45:31.222 --> 45:32.590
"I heard you fucking
in your room last night."

45:32.622 --> 45:34.191
Shut up!

45:34.224 --> 45:35.192
You wish it was you, huh,
you fucking...

45:35.226 --> 45:36.561
Shut the fuck up!

45:36.593 --> 45:38.229
Is that the only way
you can get attention?

45:38.262 --> 45:40.498
Party's over!

45:51.343 --> 45:52.679
<i>So the police,</i>

45:52.711 --> 45:54.114
they wouldn't have known
that this all started

45:54.146 --> 45:57.316
with just a stupid prank?

45:57.349 --> 46:00.586
It just set the stage
for what I did.

46:00.619 --> 46:03.188
The hoax we played.

46:03.222 --> 46:05.192
What do you mean?

46:08.127 --> 46:12.165
I told the police
I abused my position of power.

46:12.198 --> 46:14.334
Whether the kids consented
to anything we did after that

46:14.368 --> 46:15.771
didn't matter.

46:15.804 --> 46:17.439
I was their teacher,

46:17.471 --> 46:19.573
they were my students.

46:19.607 --> 46:21.777
All under 18.

46:21.809 --> 46:25.146
I asked for the severest
possible sentence.

46:29.651 --> 46:30.819
Why?

46:30.852 --> 46:32.687
Because.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.790
I wanted to go to jail.

46:34.823 --> 46:37.392
I didn't want
any of the students,

46:37.426 --> 46:40.397
the victims,
to testify.

46:40.429 --> 46:42.232
Okay, but there weren't victims.

46:42.264 --> 46:44.801
There wasn't any sex,
you just explained that.

46:44.835 --> 46:46.570
Nothing actually happened.

46:46.603 --> 46:49.239
I wanted to go to jail.

46:49.272 --> 46:51.508
For something
you didn't do?

46:51.541 --> 46:54.678
No.

46:54.711 --> 46:57.481
For something I did do.

47:24.177 --> 47:25.879
I found it in the drawer

47:25.912 --> 47:30.685
when I was looking
for the ribbons, remember?

47:30.718 --> 47:33.321
You played it
at the recital.

47:33.353 --> 47:35.823
I remember the recital.

47:35.855 --> 47:38.859
Everyone was so impressed.

47:41.563 --> 47:46.235
I remember it
for different reasons.

47:46.267 --> 47:50.572
You always wanted
to become a composer.

47:50.604 --> 47:52.374
Do you remember
when you were very little,

47:52.408 --> 47:54.544
we took you to that
visiting children's symphony?

47:54.576 --> 47:57.714
You were sitting beside her.

47:57.747 --> 48:00.149
As I was playing.

48:00.183 --> 48:02.285
Who?

48:02.317 --> 48:04.521
My teacher.

48:04.554 --> 48:07.924
Alicia.

48:07.958 --> 48:10.260
<i>Yes.</i>

48:10.293 --> 48:12.695
<i>Alicia.</i>

48:12.728 --> 48:14.898
<i>You were sitting
beside Alicia</i>

48:14.931 --> 48:20.905
<i>and Mom was beside you,
on the other side.</i>

48:20.939 --> 48:23.408
<i>She was already sick.</i>

48:23.441 --> 48:25.176
<i>Yes.</i>

48:25.209 --> 48:26.343
<i>Might have been
one of the last times</i>

48:26.377 --> 48:29.749
<i>she got out.</i>

48:29.782 --> 48:34.754
She thought
she was going to faint.

48:34.786 --> 48:36.621
She really wanted to be there.

48:36.654 --> 48:38.891
She loved you so much.

48:46.600 --> 48:50.404
I also found...

48:50.437 --> 48:53.775
this.

48:53.808 --> 48:58.880
A lucky rabbit's foot key chain.

48:58.913 --> 49:00.548
I was surprised
to find it there.

49:00.580 --> 49:02.583
You were so disgusted
when I gave it to you,

49:02.616 --> 49:04.253
you wanted to get rid of it,

49:04.285 --> 49:05.720
and then I told you
that it was bad luck

49:05.753 --> 49:07.822
to throw a good luck charm
away, and I suppose...

49:07.856 --> 49:10.758
well, I suppose you must
have taken me seriously.

49:18.433 --> 49:22.372
Alicia.

49:22.404 --> 49:26.676
Alicia was holding your hand.

49:26.708 --> 49:29.246
Her son was playing
on the stage with me.

49:29.280 --> 49:33.417
What are you talking about,
Veronica?

49:33.450 --> 49:35.019
As I was playing,

49:35.052 --> 49:39.458
I looked over
and you were holding hands.

49:39.491 --> 49:42.628
That's impossible.

49:42.660 --> 49:46.931
You left me alone
in her piano room,

49:46.964 --> 49:50.736
while she showed you
something upstairs.

49:53.672 --> 49:56.242
That happened
a couple times.

49:59.679 --> 50:02.849
That's when I composed this.

50:06.886 --> 50:08.388
As I was waiting
for you to come down

50:08.421 --> 50:11.291
from whatever
you were doing.

50:19.366 --> 50:20.601
I don't remember
what made these things

50:20.634 --> 50:22.936
so lucky.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.676
It's not something
we normally use

52:01.709 --> 52:02.978
in our cuisine,

52:03.011 --> 52:04.748
but it's an ancient dish,

52:04.780 --> 52:06.049
and we thought
we'd present it

52:06.081 --> 52:08.085
as something special,

52:08.117 --> 52:10.853
just to try.

52:10.887 --> 52:12.456
What about the ears?

52:12.489 --> 52:14.958
Why have some of the ears
been cut off?

52:14.991 --> 52:16.794
The ears are for
another restaurant.

52:16.827 --> 52:19.430
They serve them as a specialty.

52:19.464 --> 52:23.701
- Hello.
- Garo, this is an inspector.

52:23.734 --> 52:25.136
He's from the health department.

52:25.169 --> 52:27.004
Hm, I see.

52:27.037 --> 52:29.174
Um, is there something wrong?

52:29.208 --> 52:31.010
Where are these rabbits from?

52:31.043 --> 52:32.545
Our usual supplier.

52:32.578 --> 52:35.014
Can I see some documentation?

52:38.817 --> 52:40.220
We don't usually do this.

52:40.253 --> 52:41.955
Do what?

52:41.988 --> 52:43.457
Separate the ears.

52:43.490 --> 52:44.925
That's not what concerns me.

52:44.957 --> 52:47.726
You shouldn't be processing
the meat here.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.095
We're not processing.

52:49.128 --> 52:50.930
This is from our supplier.

52:50.963 --> 52:52.866
We just needed
a large quantity of meat and...

52:52.900 --> 52:54.469
And this is cheaper.

52:54.502 --> 52:56.070
Well, it might indeed
be less expensive,

52:56.103 --> 52:57.839
but thriftiness
and the health code

52:57.871 --> 53:00.107
aren't necessarily
the best of friends, are they?

53:00.140 --> 53:02.176
No, no, no, no,
that's just an invoice

53:02.208 --> 53:03.845
for the delivery
of the rabbits.

53:03.878 --> 53:05.514
It shows where they're from.

53:05.546 --> 53:07.815
They're coming here unskinned,
unprocessed.

53:07.849 --> 53:09.517
That's against code.

53:09.550 --> 53:11.819
We have an arrangement
with another restaurant.

53:11.852 --> 53:13.621
Yes, so she told me.

53:13.655 --> 53:17.227
They serve deep-fried
rabbit's ears as a specialty.

53:20.596 --> 53:23.033
As a specialty.

53:25.868 --> 53:27.704
Hm...

53:30.541 --> 53:31.842
All right.

53:31.874 --> 53:33.143
I see.

53:35.077 --> 53:37.815
Well, I'll accept that
you're not having me on

53:37.847 --> 53:41.252
about the ears, but there are
two contraventions.

53:41.285 --> 53:44.088
The first is that you're
processing the meat here.

53:44.122 --> 53:46.191
The second is that
you're reselling it

53:46.223 --> 53:48.292
to another establishment.

53:48.325 --> 53:50.661
Those are properly farmed
animals.

53:50.694 --> 53:52.931
I'm sure they are, but they're
not properly processed.

53:52.965 --> 53:56.035
I'm gonna have
to close you down.

53:56.067 --> 53:57.669
Close us down?

53:57.702 --> 54:01.907
Yes, these are
major health code violations.

54:03.676 --> 54:05.044
Sorry.

54:30.838 --> 54:35.009
Look, sir, there must be
something we can do.

54:35.042 --> 54:37.012
There is a huge event here,
and we really...

54:37.044 --> 54:40.317
- I'm just doing my job.
- And so are we.

54:40.350 --> 54:42.185
No, no, no, you're not,
though, are you?

54:42.217 --> 54:43.252
You're not just doing your job.

54:43.286 --> 54:44.921
If you were doing your job,

54:44.953 --> 54:46.755
we wouldn't find ourselves
in this situation.

54:46.788 --> 54:50.326
Your job is to make sure
that this restaurant operates

54:50.359 --> 54:53.096
in full compliance
with the health code.

54:53.130 --> 54:57.168
That's not happening here,
is it?

54:57.200 --> 54:59.637
This is the second restaurant
I've had to close today.

54:59.669 --> 55:02.706
That doesn't make me happy.

55:02.740 --> 55:06.244
I understand how hard
you both had to work

55:06.277 --> 55:10.683
to make this place what it is,
and I know it's not easy.

55:12.750 --> 55:16.221
Please, I know
it's not easy to...

55:16.255 --> 55:19.258
build a reputation.

55:27.067 --> 55:29.203
Maybe I wasn't clear.

55:29.236 --> 55:31.806
This is for a private event.

55:33.305 --> 55:35.041
Meaning?

55:35.075 --> 55:37.877
Meaning we are not charging
anyone for this meat.

55:37.910 --> 55:42.250
They are friends
coming here for a party.

55:42.282 --> 55:44.418
So the restaurant
is closed tonight?

55:46.353 --> 55:47.888
It's on Tuesday.

55:47.922 --> 55:51.394
We're closed
for a private event on Tuesday.

55:51.426 --> 55:55.164
So you're telling me
that this rabbit meat

55:55.196 --> 55:56.932
will not be served
to any member

55:56.964 --> 55:59.135
of the paying public.

55:59.167 --> 56:01.069
Are you sure about that
'cause I didn't see a sign

56:01.102 --> 56:02.171
about the restaurant
being closed...

56:02.203 --> 56:05.141
I was just about to put it up.

56:07.844 --> 56:10.813
What about these ears?

56:10.846 --> 56:13.015
We can throw them away.

56:13.049 --> 56:15.218
No problem.

57:12.179 --> 57:13.914
Why are you showing me this?

57:13.947 --> 57:15.718
It's proof.

57:17.152 --> 57:18.855
Of what?

57:18.888 --> 57:23.058
How could I be holding her hand
if I was shooting this?

57:23.091 --> 57:25.127
Does it take two hands
to shoot something

57:25.160 --> 57:26.929
with your camera?

57:26.963 --> 57:29.867
It takes concentration.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.468
- But one hand.
- Does that make

57:31.501 --> 57:34.505
any kind of sense to you,
Veronica?

57:34.538 --> 57:37.273
That I could be
shooting you playing

57:37.306 --> 57:39.076
whilst holding
your teacher's hand

57:39.109 --> 57:42.914
and your mother is sick
beside me?

57:42.946 --> 57:44.915
Your mother was seated
on my left.

57:44.948 --> 57:48.787
Your teacher was seated
on my right.

57:48.819 --> 57:51.357
The beginning of this video
makes that perfectly clear.

57:51.389 --> 57:54.292
Now this was
a right-handed camera.

57:54.326 --> 57:56.561
I'm right-handed.
How could I be shooting this

57:56.594 --> 57:58.230
with my right hand

57:58.262 --> 58:00.031
if I was holding her hand
at the same time?

58:00.065 --> 58:02.903
It's impossible.

58:02.935 --> 58:05.004
I understand.

58:05.037 --> 58:07.506
You've done an excellent job
in proving that.

58:07.539 --> 58:10.042
Thank you.

58:14.613 --> 58:17.918
She was the love of my life.

58:17.951 --> 58:20.854
- Who, Dad?
- Your mother.

58:22.489 --> 58:23.925
You must know that, Veronica.

58:23.958 --> 58:26.360
I could never love
anybody else.

58:26.393 --> 58:29.532
And you promised her
you'd look after me.

58:31.399 --> 58:33.468
Her dying wish.

58:33.501 --> 58:36.405
Yeah.

58:36.437 --> 58:38.506
And here I am.

58:41.277 --> 58:43.513
Here we are.

01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:28.393
Smile.

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.197
One more.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.390
Wee!

01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:15.542
How is everything, sir?

01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:17.478
- Delicious.
- Thank you, sir.

01:02:17.511 --> 01:02:20.614
I wonder if I could have a word
with your manager?

01:02:20.647 --> 01:02:23.717
Your cousin, I believe.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:25.453
Is there something wrong?

01:02:25.485 --> 01:02:28.122
No, no, no, no. I just have
a question for him.

01:02:28.155 --> 01:02:30.591
- Ah.
- Thank you.

01:02:40.835 --> 01:02:43.638
Yes, sir. I hope everything
is to your satisfaction.

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:44.841
Oh, completely.

01:02:44.873 --> 01:02:48.477
The food was delicious.

01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:51.315
There was a small problem

01:02:51.347 --> 01:02:53.851
in the washroom, though.

01:02:53.883 --> 01:02:55.418
I didn't know...

01:02:55.452 --> 01:02:56.620
It's all right.

01:02:56.653 --> 01:02:58.789
It's not an official inspection.

01:02:58.822 --> 01:03:00.457
I'm actually here as a fan.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.361
I saw that wonderful article
in the newspaper

01:03:03.393 --> 01:03:04.596
and thought, "Well,
I've got to check

01:03:04.629 --> 01:03:07.198
that place out for myself."

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.767
You just might want to take
a careful look at the floor

01:03:09.799 --> 01:03:12.236
in the men's washroom.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.306
Excuse me.

01:03:23.548 --> 01:03:24.682
- Heinz.
- Ja.

01:03:24.715 --> 01:03:26.251
I do know your name.

01:03:26.284 --> 01:03:29.388
I read that article
in the newspaper.

01:03:29.421 --> 01:03:31.624
That's how I know Gunter
is your cousin.

01:03:31.658 --> 01:03:34.627
I started a restaurant myself
many years ago.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.231
- Oh, in this city?
- Yes, though I did have plans

01:03:38.263 --> 01:03:41.168
to expand into other cities.

01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:42.703
Very good, yeah.

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:44.871
Build an empire.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.673
Anyway...

01:03:46.706 --> 01:03:48.375
That's history now.

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:50.712
Had to sell half to my partner,

01:03:50.745 --> 01:03:54.783
get into something
with more regular hours.

01:03:54.816 --> 01:03:56.885
- Ah.
- I needed to spend more time

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:59.220
with my family.

01:04:02.323 --> 01:04:03.625
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:04:03.659 --> 01:04:05.295
The reason I called you over,
Heinz,

01:04:05.328 --> 01:04:06.696
I wonder if you could
get me another glass?

01:04:06.728 --> 01:04:08.197
I'd love to finish this wine
with Gunter.

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.765
Oh, naturally.

01:04:09.799 --> 01:04:11.868
One moment.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.476
I'm so sorry.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:23.247
Take a seat.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.448
I wonder if you'd...

01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:29.821
if I could offer you
some of this excellent wine.

01:04:31.855 --> 01:04:34.258
It's inexcusable.

01:04:36.527 --> 01:04:38.898
Well...

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:42.267
These things happen.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.670
At least it didn't occur
during an official inspection.

01:04:45.704 --> 01:04:47.974
You wouldn't want to have
this place closed down.

01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:50.743
Not after all the hard work
you've put into it.

01:04:50.777 --> 01:04:52.846
There aren't many restaurants
like this left, are there,

01:04:52.879 --> 01:04:55.248
built on so many years
of tradition.

01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:57.316
I read that in the article.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:59.553
How your family came here
after the war,

01:04:59.585 --> 01:05:03.690
how tough it was to settle in.

01:05:03.724 --> 01:05:05.559
I understand
a little of that myself.

01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:09.263
It's not easy
being from somewhere else.

01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:12.467
We just had an inspection
a few weeks ago.

01:05:12.499 --> 01:05:16.037
Like I said,
I'm not here officially.

01:05:16.071 --> 01:05:18.473
Then why did you mention
closing it down?

01:05:18.506 --> 01:05:19.941
Well, that would be
a last resort.

01:05:19.975 --> 01:05:21.043
You can do that?

01:05:21.075 --> 01:05:22.610
On a private visit?

01:05:22.644 --> 01:05:25.413
Well, it's much the same
as a citizen's arrest.

01:05:25.446 --> 01:05:27.683
Although, of course, this would
carry much more weight.

01:05:27.717 --> 01:05:29.885
I am a professional.

01:05:29.918 --> 01:05:31.954
I do have a badge.

01:05:33.623 --> 01:05:34.958
What do you want from me?

01:05:34.991 --> 01:05:36.726
You mean besides making sure

01:05:36.759 --> 01:05:40.732
that you get rid of
this rat infestation?

01:05:42.765 --> 01:05:45.635
Your grandson works here
in the kitchen, doesn't he?

01:05:45.669 --> 01:05:47.739
Is he here tonight?

01:05:49.372 --> 01:05:50.541
Yeah.

01:05:50.574 --> 01:05:52.343
Well, I'd like a word with him.

01:05:52.377 --> 01:05:55.480
I've tried reaching out,
phone calls, texts, e-mails,

01:05:55.512 --> 01:05:57.982
but he just keeps ignoring me.

01:05:59.683 --> 01:06:02.488
I think you might know why.

01:06:04.356 --> 01:06:06.391
You're her father.

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:08.928
Yes, I am.

01:06:10.963 --> 01:06:12.432
When did you work that out?

01:06:12.465 --> 01:06:14.100
Just now.

01:06:14.133 --> 01:06:16.402
Well...

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:18.604
I'd like that conversation

01:06:18.638 --> 01:06:21.842
here with your grandson
right now.

01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:24.110
I'd like you to be seated
across the room

01:06:24.143 --> 01:06:27.715
on that stool by the bar

01:06:27.749 --> 01:06:29.984
and make sure
he doesn't avoid me.

01:06:30.017 --> 01:06:33.955
Now, if you do that, I promise
I won't show any photographs

01:06:33.988 --> 01:06:35.790
of the rat shit in the washroom

01:06:35.822 --> 01:06:39.127
to my colleagues at work.

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:42.098
Now, does that sound fair?

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:55.878
<i>They were holding hands.</i>

01:06:55.912 --> 01:06:59.649
<i>He denies it,
but it's what I saw.</i>

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:00.917
He only let go of her hand

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:03.487
when he applauded me
at the end.

01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:07.892
Was your mother aware?

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:10.160
What do you mean?

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:11.996
It's just that I think
sometimes people,

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:13.164
whether it's right or wrong,

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.501
they, um,

01:07:16.534 --> 01:07:19.404
come to an arrangement.

01:07:19.438 --> 01:07:21.740
Arrangement?

01:07:25.177 --> 01:07:27.046
The lessons were at her house.

01:07:27.078 --> 01:07:28.147
It was close to where we lived.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.550
I could walk home alone.

01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:33.051
I began lessons
when I was eight.

01:07:33.084 --> 01:07:36.655
This was a year later.

01:07:36.689 --> 01:07:39.659
I remember because I got
Benjamin that year.

01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:43.130
Benjamin Bunny. Right.

01:07:43.163 --> 01:07:46.666
Yes. Benjamin Bunny.

01:07:49.002 --> 01:07:52.474
Sometimes Alicia
would send me off,

01:07:52.506 --> 01:07:54.876
say she needed a rest.

01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:58.847
I think she got migraines.

01:07:58.879 --> 01:08:01.983
She'd go upstairs and smoke.

01:08:02.015 --> 01:08:05.154
This one day,
I didn't leave immediately.

01:08:05.187 --> 01:08:07.889
I had an idea
for a composition,

01:08:07.922 --> 01:08:10.759
I was writing it down.

01:08:10.793 --> 01:08:14.932
When I finished,
I went upstairs

01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:17.867
<i>and I saw her.</i>

01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:20.837
<i>I remember the cigarette
in her hand.</i>

01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:24.942
<i>I remember her hand falling.</i>

01:08:26.611 --> 01:08:30.113
<i>The cigarette was still lit.</i>

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:33.518
<i>There was some sheet music
stacked there.</i>

01:08:35.051 --> 01:08:37.621
<i>It caught fire.</i>

01:08:39.224 --> 01:08:42.895
I didn't want her
to become my new mom.

01:08:49.767 --> 01:08:52.238
It must have been hard
for my father.

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:57.743
Losing both women
so close to each other.

01:09:12.692 --> 01:09:15.830
I've been reaching out to you,
but you've been ignoring me.

01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:17.866
I was told not to respond.

01:09:17.898 --> 01:09:19.901
By my daughter?

01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:22.837
And others.

01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:24.540
I have a right to know
what happened.

01:09:24.572 --> 01:09:26.643
A right?

01:09:26.676 --> 01:09:28.912
I'm the victim here.

01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:30.212
Your daughter
is the one in jail

01:09:30.246 --> 01:09:32.747
for abusing
her position of power.

01:09:32.782 --> 01:09:34.317
What she did to my friend
and me.

01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:36.685
Of course.

01:09:38.787 --> 01:09:41.256
What's left to know?

01:09:41.291 --> 01:09:45.095
Well, she's come out
with some new details.

01:09:45.127 --> 01:09:47.064
- Like what?
- Like the fact

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:50.768
the texts weren't sent by her.

01:09:50.801 --> 01:09:52.170
Is that what she's telling you?

01:09:52.203 --> 01:09:54.806
Yes. So I did some checking
of my own.

01:09:54.838 --> 01:09:56.240
The schedule
of the concert times

01:09:56.273 --> 01:09:59.777
and the first text
that was sent.

01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:02.747
- Mm-hm.
- They don't match.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:06.786
She was conducting
and you must have been playing.

01:10:06.818 --> 01:10:09.021
Yeah, maybe.

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:13.125
And if I know my daughter,
and I do know my daughter,

01:10:13.157 --> 01:10:14.627
she would have asked everyone

01:10:14.661 --> 01:10:16.797
to leave their phones
on the bus.

01:10:18.197 --> 01:10:19.966
Okay.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.337
So someone else sent that text
to you from her phone.

01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:24.904
I have nothing else to say.

01:10:24.938 --> 01:10:26.774
You know, I could close
this place down.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:28.775
Didn't your grandfather
explain that to you?

01:10:28.809 --> 01:10:31.244
Yeah, did he tell you
that it would be extortion?

01:10:31.278 --> 01:10:34.583
After what I found...

01:10:36.716 --> 01:10:39.754
I cleaned that bathroom
spotless two hours ago.

01:10:39.788 --> 01:10:42.790
And then the rat came in.

01:10:42.824 --> 01:10:44.226
Did he?

01:10:46.061 --> 01:10:47.863
I saw you go in there
right before you called

01:10:47.896 --> 01:10:49.264
my grandfather over.

01:10:49.297 --> 01:10:50.834
- So?
- So,

01:10:50.866 --> 01:10:52.668
you could've planted it there.

01:10:52.701 --> 01:10:54.336
So...

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:57.040
So is it fresh?

01:10:57.072 --> 01:10:58.974
If I took it to the police?

01:10:59.008 --> 01:11:01.177
You're right. That's precisely
the sort of thing

01:11:01.209 --> 01:11:03.713
the police would love to throw
all their resources behind,

01:11:03.746 --> 01:11:06.082
checking that the rat shit
you're presenting to them

01:11:06.116 --> 01:11:09.120
is indeed fresh.

01:11:09.152 --> 01:11:11.688
Has my grandson answered
everything you need to know?

01:11:11.721 --> 01:11:13.090
I'd like a few more minutes.

01:11:13.122 --> 01:11:15.426
- Can I get you anything?
- Just the bill, please.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.663
No, it's not a problem,
it's on us.

01:11:17.695 --> 01:11:20.032
I insist.

01:11:27.205 --> 01:11:30.043
Listen...

01:11:30.075 --> 01:11:34.180
All I want to know
is if that's the truth,

01:11:34.212 --> 01:11:36.148
that the texts
were waiting for you

01:11:36.181 --> 01:11:38.886
when you got back to the bus.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.922
Yeah.

01:11:41.954 --> 01:11:44.691
It happened.

01:11:44.724 --> 01:11:47.695
The bus driver sent them.

01:11:51.299 --> 01:11:54.402
- The bus driver.
- Mm-hm.

01:11:57.004 --> 01:11:59.941
- And you responded?
- Sure, yeah.

01:11:59.973 --> 01:12:01.876
Why?

01:12:03.412 --> 01:12:06.248
It was a prank.

01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:08.484
If I responded, then he'd
be able to see the text

01:12:08.516 --> 01:12:11.120
next time he got access
to her phone

01:12:11.153 --> 01:12:13.389
which was every time
that we were playing

01:12:13.421 --> 01:12:15.324
and every time
that he was alone.

01:12:15.358 --> 01:12:17.461
Was this bus driver
upset with her?

01:12:17.493 --> 01:12:19.962
Upset, yeah.

01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:24.200
Yeah. Obsessed is another way
of putting it.

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:29.406
He was messing around with her,

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.377
so we started messing
around with him.

01:12:33.409 --> 01:12:36.279
That's how we lured him
into the room.

01:12:36.312 --> 01:12:40.918
I sent her a text
inviting her to a party,

01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:44.489
and he got it when he got
access to her phone.

01:12:44.522 --> 01:12:47.358
And when she told the police
she'd had sex with you...

01:12:47.392 --> 01:12:49.495
I said yes.

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.100
I said that the rumors
about the three-way,

01:12:54.133 --> 01:12:56.402
- they were true.
- No, they weren't.

01:12:56.434 --> 01:12:58.837
No.

01:12:58.871 --> 01:13:00.807
They were just to bug him.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.178
- What about your reputations?
- Our reputations?

01:13:04.211 --> 01:13:06.180
Listen, you really think
having sex with your daughter

01:13:06.212 --> 01:13:08.548
is gonna affect
our reputations?

01:13:08.582 --> 01:13:09.917
They put her in jail.

01:13:09.949 --> 01:13:11.952
No, she wanted to go to jail.

01:13:11.984 --> 01:13:14.021
She confessed.

01:13:14.055 --> 01:13:16.258
Nobody asked me to testify.

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.360
Nobody asked me to go to court.

01:13:18.392 --> 01:13:21.462
They gave me some pretty useless
counseling sessions

01:13:21.495 --> 01:13:26.502
for the terrifying trauma,
sleeping with your daughter,

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:29.239
and that was that.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:46.490
She might have mentioned
something else.

01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:55.167
About her boyfriend's suicide.

01:13:58.235 --> 01:14:01.072
What did she say about that?

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.374
That she felt responsible.

01:14:03.408 --> 01:14:05.977
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:14:06.011 --> 01:14:07.814
You should ask her.

01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:11.284
You know your daughter, right?

01:14:25.365 --> 01:14:27.068
<i>From the moment I began,</i>

01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:30.138
<i>she told me
I should've started earlier.</i>

01:14:31.537 --> 01:14:34.442
I was gifted,

01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:37.979
but I needed to catch up.

01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:41.617
My father would sit in a chair
in the room

01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:43.551
and watch the two of us,

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:48.290
but I began to realize
he was watching her.

01:14:50.259 --> 01:14:53.096
The lessons were
just an excuse.

01:14:54.563 --> 01:14:58.100
Why couldn't he see her alone?

01:14:58.134 --> 01:15:02.672
Maybe this is how
they wanted to...

01:15:02.705 --> 01:15:05.308
to see each other.

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:10.881
As though my...

01:15:12.516 --> 01:15:17.289
...my presence made
their feelings for each other

01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:19.090
more intense. I...

01:15:20.691 --> 01:15:23.294
Is that possible?

01:15:23.328 --> 01:15:26.064
That I was responsible?

01:15:28.299 --> 01:15:31.336
Well, your mother was sick,

01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:32.671
and whatever
might have happened

01:15:32.705 --> 01:15:34.340
between your father
and your teacher

01:15:34.372 --> 01:15:36.142
didn't cause that.

01:15:36.174 --> 01:15:38.244
Might have happened?

01:15:38.278 --> 01:15:39.579
I just meant that I...

01:15:39.612 --> 01:15:42.616
Wait, so...

01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:47.221
So you're saying this could
all have been in my head.

01:15:51.025 --> 01:15:53.728
It wasn't in your head,
Veronica.

01:15:53.761 --> 01:15:56.064
It did happen.

01:15:56.096 --> 01:16:00.233
Alicia felt terrible
about the affair.

01:16:00.266 --> 01:16:03.972
She was mortified
you'd find out.

01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:08.009
She was a member
of our congregation,

01:16:08.043 --> 01:16:10.379
and she and I became
quite close.

01:16:12.213 --> 01:16:14.583
Well, Alicia told me
that your mother knew about

01:16:14.616 --> 01:16:17.987
what was going on.

01:16:18.021 --> 01:16:22.025
That she'd given
your father permission.

01:16:22.058 --> 01:16:24.194
Did he know that?

01:16:24.227 --> 01:16:26.197
My father?

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:31.502
Uh...

01:16:31.535 --> 01:16:35.238
I delivered the eulogy
at Alicia's funeral.

01:16:37.674 --> 01:16:39.610
Your father told me
I'd done a good job

01:16:39.644 --> 01:16:43.015
of summing up who she was.

01:16:46.051 --> 01:16:49.455
I asked him how he knew her.

01:16:51.556 --> 01:16:55.060
And he said
she was your teacher.

01:16:55.093 --> 01:16:58.196
That you were too upset
to come.

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:01.634
Like you were so upset
about her son.

01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:04.038
About Walter.

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:10.143
Why didn't he tell me
any of this?

01:17:17.285 --> 01:17:19.754
Maybe he thought you wouldn't
have believed him.

01:18:05.269 --> 01:18:08.639
Now it looks like she won't
be coming home at all.

01:18:08.673 --> 01:18:11.143
They want to move her
to a hospice

01:18:11.175 --> 01:18:13.779
and I can't administer
the medicine.

01:18:13.813 --> 01:18:15.515
What does Veronica think
of it all?

01:18:15.547 --> 01:18:18.718
Oh, I haven't told her.

01:18:18.751 --> 01:18:20.787
She knows her mommy is sick,
but I haven't managed

01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:24.857
to talk to her
about the full gravity of it.

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:28.528
I don't foresee a time
where I'll ever be able to...

01:18:28.561 --> 01:18:32.365
communicate
what's happening right now.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.956
We thought you might come back.

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:59.527
I thought you were throwing
these rabbit ears away.

01:19:59.559 --> 01:20:01.763
On second thought,
since you told us

01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:04.600
we cannot distribute them,
we thought we might as well

01:20:04.632 --> 01:20:05.666
serve them to our friends.

01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:07.368
That's okay, isn't it?

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:08.604
It's not that
they're very popular,

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:10.304
as you can see.

01:20:10.337 --> 01:20:12.541
- Are you still on duty?
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:20:12.573 --> 01:20:14.376
Well, perfect then.

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.246
Please enjoy.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.847
Thank you.

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:23.686
Another, please.

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:26.656
- Thank you.
- Hello, everyone!

01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:28.525
Hello, may I have
your attention, please?

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:29.627
Thank you.

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:31.394
Time for a few words.

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:32.997
I'd like to introduce you
to the person

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:34.698
who organized this happy event,

01:20:34.731 --> 01:20:37.501
not that she needs
any introduction, Anna.

01:20:51.849 --> 01:20:54.553
I love you, Anna.

01:20:54.585 --> 01:20:56.388
Thank you, thank you.

01:21:34.596 --> 01:21:36.398
Oh.

01:21:58.654 --> 01:22:00.925
A word.

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:02.426
This way.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.600
Mm, and this.

01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:14.140
Mm.

01:22:14.173 --> 01:22:16.542
Um...

01:22:16.574 --> 01:22:19.444
Well, hello.

01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:21.646
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.981
Um, I don't know what to say.

01:22:23.015 --> 01:22:27.053
Um, well, my name is Jim.

01:22:27.086 --> 01:22:28.054
That's a start.

01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:30.758
Um...

01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:35.695
Um, I am a food inspector,
as it happens,

01:22:35.728 --> 01:22:38.933
and I, um, I spend my days

01:22:38.965 --> 01:22:42.936
going from restaurant
to restaurant,

01:22:42.969 --> 01:22:45.906
making sure that things
are up to standard, you see.

01:22:45.939 --> 01:22:47.875
Standards of health
and cleanliness.

01:22:47.908 --> 01:22:50.845
And I was going to close
this place down, actually.

01:22:50.878 --> 01:22:52.415
But, uh, no,

01:22:52.448 --> 01:22:56.085
I thought I'd observed
a contravention,

01:22:56.118 --> 01:22:58.421
something to do
with those ears over there

01:22:58.453 --> 01:23:02.691
but, in fact,
I realize what I saw

01:23:02.725 --> 01:23:04.194
was not what it was.

01:23:04.226 --> 01:23:07.830
There was, in fact,
a greater health issue at work,

01:23:07.864 --> 01:23:09.666
namely the health
of this family

01:23:09.699 --> 01:23:15.039
and your desire to celebrate
a milestone.

01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:16.973
Um, I don't even know,
what is it,

01:23:17.007 --> 01:23:19.076
a wedding announcement,
I presume?

01:23:19.109 --> 01:23:22.547
- She's becoming a doctor.
- Oh!

01:23:24.048 --> 01:23:26.752
Thanks, Mom.

01:23:26.785 --> 01:23:29.655
Well, um, congratulations.

01:23:29.688 --> 01:23:32.524
- Thank you.
- Doctor. Goodness.

01:23:32.557 --> 01:23:35.059
Um...

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:39.131
A reputation
is about to be made.

01:23:39.165 --> 01:23:43.870
And here you all are, in unity,

01:23:43.903 --> 01:23:46.773
for this feast

01:23:46.805 --> 01:23:50.510
that will bind you
all together, so...

01:23:53.547 --> 01:23:55.450
His blood.

01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:04.692
I don't understand.

01:24:04.726 --> 01:24:07.094
I'd inspected the restaurant
earlier in the week,

01:24:07.128 --> 01:24:10.165
and they made me a promise,
so I went back to check.

01:24:10.198 --> 01:24:12.601
I found something
they weren't supposed to serve,

01:24:12.633 --> 01:24:14.169
and I could've
closed them down,

01:24:14.202 --> 01:24:17.005
but then they told me
it was for a private party.

01:24:17.039 --> 01:24:18.641
So you went back to make sure.

01:24:18.674 --> 01:24:20.776
Yes. And like I say,
they welcomed me

01:24:20.808 --> 01:24:23.012
and they made me feel at home.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:27.551
- That's nice of them.
- Yeah.

01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:32.022
At one point they asked me
to get up and say a few words.

01:24:33.924 --> 01:24:35.960
Why?

01:24:37.894 --> 01:24:40.531
I think I had become
their guest of honor.

01:24:53.712 --> 01:24:57.783
Some of you may have heard
about my daughter.

01:24:59.584 --> 01:25:03.589
What happened
to her reputation.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.335
Anyway...

01:25:25.647 --> 01:25:27.282
You see, if I told you
my daughter's name,

01:25:27.314 --> 01:25:31.185
you'd all reach
for your phones, wouldn't you?

01:25:31.219 --> 01:25:35.023
All pick up your phones and...

01:25:35.055 --> 01:25:37.693
search.

01:25:37.726 --> 01:25:40.796
And there'd be a flurry
of articles, and you'd think,

01:25:40.829 --> 01:25:45.300
"My goodness, how could a woman
do something like that?

01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:47.369
What kind of home
must she have come from?"

01:25:47.403 --> 01:25:51.174
Well, I can tell you she came
from a very loving family.

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:54.645
A very loving family.

01:25:54.677 --> 01:25:57.614
And my wife and I supported
her musical talent,

01:25:57.647 --> 01:26:02.286
and I took precious time
away from work

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.924
and I was thrilled.

01:26:08.058 --> 01:26:11.829
Thrilled to support her.

01:26:11.862 --> 01:26:15.000
I'd attend her classes, and...

01:26:16.769 --> 01:26:18.838
And, then...

01:26:20.839 --> 01:26:24.376
Well, then,
her entire world collapsed

01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:26.212
when her mother died,
of course,

01:26:26.246 --> 01:26:29.282
and everything was different
then, everything.

01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:32.219
Um...

01:26:32.252 --> 01:26:33.387
You see...

01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:38.960
I could never believe
that my daughter...

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.797
...Veronica...

01:26:44.397 --> 01:26:48.136
...was capable of such...

01:26:48.168 --> 01:26:50.940
terrible crimes.

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:56.245
And, now,
I suppose it's up to me

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:58.813
to find this person
who spread these rumors,

01:26:58.847 --> 01:27:02.952
these awful rumors,
they just grew like a...

01:27:04.487 --> 01:27:06.423
...cancer.

01:27:09.325 --> 01:27:12.295
Like an insidious cancer.

01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:15.198
Doctor.

01:27:17.867 --> 01:27:20.904
Not everything can be cured.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:28.246
These rumors that landed her
in jail, my little girl.

01:27:33.383 --> 01:27:35.386
So, if necessary,

01:27:35.419 --> 01:27:39.993
I will extract
my own vengeance...

01:27:41.459 --> 01:27:45.064
...on this bus driver.

01:27:47.232 --> 01:27:51.371
In fact, I swear, now,
here in front of you all...

01:27:53.106 --> 01:27:55.075
...I will find

01:27:55.107 --> 01:27:59.746
this horribly diseased beast...

01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:05.087
...and kill it.

01:28:09.523 --> 01:28:11.158
Here, the taxi will
take you home.

01:28:11.192 --> 01:28:12.359
- Yeah.
- Careful.

01:28:12.393 --> 01:28:14.197
Home.

01:28:16.864 --> 01:28:18.266
Jim...

01:28:19.868 --> 01:28:22.271
Drink as much water
as possible.

01:28:22.304 --> 01:28:24.140
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:28:24.172 --> 01:28:27.310
This man you're speaking about,
the bus driver...

01:28:27.342 --> 01:28:29.779
He destroyed
my daughter's life.

01:28:29.812 --> 01:28:31.280
Yes.

01:28:33.248 --> 01:28:36.285
Where does he live?

01:28:36.319 --> 01:28:38.856
I'm not sure.

01:28:38.888 --> 01:28:41.858
That's good.

01:28:41.892 --> 01:28:44.195
Drink a lot of water
before you sleep.

01:28:44.227 --> 01:28:45.862
Okay?

01:28:45.896 --> 01:28:47.831
What's your address?

01:28:47.865 --> 01:28:49.935
I'll tell him.

01:29:11.489 --> 01:29:13.560
Ah.

01:29:21.935 --> 01:29:23.404
Jim Davis?

01:29:25.173 --> 01:29:26.842
You mentioned something
about your daughter.

01:29:26.874 --> 01:29:28.243
No, no, no, no.

01:29:28.276 --> 01:29:31.580
This has nothing to do
with my daughter.

01:29:31.612 --> 01:29:33.914
Is this something
the two of you discussed?

01:29:33.948 --> 01:29:36.450
Extracting some sort of revenge
against this individual

01:29:36.484 --> 01:29:38.920
- who sent the texts?
- Revenge?

01:29:38.954 --> 01:29:42.625
The type you mentioned
at the party at the restaurant.

01:29:42.657 --> 01:29:46.528
"I will extract my own vengeance
on this bus driver,"

01:29:46.562 --> 01:29:50.868
or, "I will find this horribly
diseased beast and kill it."

01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:55.972
Have you made any travel plans?

01:29:56.005 --> 01:29:57.273
What do you mean?

01:29:57.306 --> 01:30:00.077
To pay the bus driver a visit?

01:30:01.913 --> 01:30:04.616
There's also a report
of you drinking a lot.

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:07.018
Look, we all understand
this is probably the result

01:30:07.051 --> 01:30:09.554
of a drunken night,
so let's just get this done.

01:30:09.587 --> 01:30:12.056
And we'll leave you alone.

01:30:12.088 --> 01:30:13.558
Mr. Davis?

01:30:34.513 --> 01:30:37.117
Um, excuse me for a second.

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.611
I wanted to ask you a favor.

01:31:02.645 --> 01:31:06.449
If you could take the feet off.

01:31:08.351 --> 01:31:12.355
I'd do it myself,
but it doesn't seem right.

01:31:12.387 --> 01:31:15.993
You've got the tools,
you've got the experience.

01:31:17.694 --> 01:31:20.196
I've already cleaned the feet.

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:22.433
I washed them in warm water
with soap

01:31:22.466 --> 01:31:25.970
and rinsed them thoroughly,
and then squeezed out

01:31:26.004 --> 01:31:28.974
the excess water like this.

01:31:29.006 --> 01:31:33.178
Now the feet
need to be separated.

01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:37.315
I did try, I just couldn't
cut them off.

01:31:37.349 --> 01:31:40.319
But you could.

01:31:40.352 --> 01:31:42.321
Like you did with the ears.

01:31:44.355 --> 01:31:47.126
You'll have to leave.

01:31:51.197 --> 01:31:55.301
You reported me to the police.

01:31:55.335 --> 01:31:59.538
You told them I was
going to kill someone.

01:31:59.572 --> 01:32:03.244
Please, let's go this way.

01:32:03.276 --> 01:32:05.279
Please, please, come.

01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:07.280
Through here, come.

01:32:07.314 --> 01:32:08.615
Please.

01:32:08.649 --> 01:32:11.285
Just four quick chops
with a cleaver

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:13.355
and then I'll leave,
I promise.

01:32:13.388 --> 01:32:16.358
I'll never bother you again.

01:32:18.293 --> 01:32:20.329
Take it.

01:33:04.843 --> 01:33:07.047
Thank you for this.

01:33:08.513 --> 01:33:11.484
Now you must leave.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.837
<i>...horribly diseased beast...</i>

01:33:31.538 --> 01:33:35.143
<i>...and kill it.</i>

01:33:35.175 --> 01:33:36.710
Where did you get this?

01:33:36.743 --> 01:33:39.280
It was sent to the police
by someone at the party.

01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:41.883
They were kind enough to share.

01:33:41.917 --> 01:33:44.453
Who was kind enough, Dad?

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.154
The police?

01:33:46.188 --> 01:33:48.390
The person who took this?

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:51.460
I got carried away.

01:33:51.494 --> 01:33:54.531
Why would you say
something like that?

01:33:54.564 --> 01:33:57.234
It came over me.

01:33:57.266 --> 01:33:58.567
And they took you seriously?

01:33:58.601 --> 01:34:00.504
Well, they had to, love.

01:34:00.537 --> 01:34:01.539
It was a public event.

01:34:01.571 --> 01:34:03.173
I uttered a death threat.

01:34:03.206 --> 01:34:05.776
They were just following
the rules.

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:07.544
And why would they think
I'd have anything to do

01:34:07.577 --> 01:34:09.312
with a death threat?

01:34:09.346 --> 01:34:11.616
Because of these visits.

01:34:11.648 --> 01:34:16.654
They thought we might be
planning something.

01:34:16.688 --> 01:34:19.825
Does this mean my sentence
is extended?

01:34:21.626 --> 01:34:25.165
What's wrong with you?

01:34:25.198 --> 01:34:27.200
You are, Dad.

01:34:28.868 --> 01:34:32.372
Everything you've done,
everything you are,

01:34:32.404 --> 01:34:34.174
everything I've watched
with you growing up

01:34:34.207 --> 01:34:36.944
is what's wrong with me.

01:34:39.913 --> 01:34:43.251
And what's right with me.

01:34:52.293 --> 01:34:54.529
I was lucky enough
to have met Jim.

01:34:54.562 --> 01:34:57.465
It was brief, but memorable.

01:34:57.498 --> 01:35:00.634
I had just arrived up here
and, frankly, at times

01:35:00.668 --> 01:35:03.472
I felt a little out of place.

01:35:03.505 --> 01:35:06.375
It was my first eulogy
here at this church

01:35:06.407 --> 01:35:08.878
and it left an impression.

01:35:08.911 --> 01:35:12.315
It was for a young woman,
Alicia,

01:35:12.348 --> 01:35:15.284
who had passed away tragically.

01:35:15.318 --> 01:35:16.853
Jim approached me
after the service

01:35:16.885 --> 01:35:18.354
to say how proud he was

01:35:18.388 --> 01:35:21.225
of his daughter's
musical talents,

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:26.396
and the tremendous inspiration
that Alicia had provided her.

01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:29.734
Like so many
in our congregation,

01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:33.604
he was devastated by her death.

01:35:33.637 --> 01:35:35.840
So while we're here today

01:35:35.873 --> 01:35:38.944
to mourn Jim's passing,

01:35:38.976 --> 01:35:42.981
let's also take a moment
to remember Alicia.

01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:51.357
Actually,
there's one last thing.

01:35:53.692 --> 01:35:57.830
I was wondering if you could
bury these with my father?

01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:03.638
Maybe I'll keep one.

01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:06.439
You can have one too.

01:36:06.473 --> 01:36:09.310
You'd like for this
to be in the grave?

01:36:09.343 --> 01:36:10.745
Uh, I was hoping
that they could be

01:36:10.777 --> 01:36:13.414
in the coffin with him.

01:36:13.448 --> 01:36:15.717
That was my father's
final request.

01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:18.453
He wanted one in each hand.

01:36:18.485 --> 01:36:21.657
Benjamin meant a lot to him.

01:36:21.689 --> 01:36:24.292
He meant a lot to both of us.

01:36:26.462 --> 01:36:29.999
I looked up what made
rabbit feet so lucky.

01:36:30.031 --> 01:36:31.833
My favorite theory
is that they're lucky

01:36:31.867 --> 01:36:34.736
because rabbits
live underground.

01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:38.442
It's their natural habitat.

01:36:38.474 --> 01:36:41.879
They communicate with spirits
of the underworld.

01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:21.421
The last work on the program
is an original piece of music

01:37:21.453 --> 01:37:23.923
I composed myself.

01:37:23.957 --> 01:37:27.094
It's a tune I came up with...

01:37:28.728 --> 01:37:34.002
...uh, a very difficult
part of my life...

01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:38.841
...when I was a girl.
