00:54.363 --> 00:58.299
Don't worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on. We're almost rid of it.

01:16.385 --> 01:19.013
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

01:19.088 --> 01:21.716
Run! Run!

01:21.790 --> 01:26.386
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.
Come on. Help me bury it.

01:29.698 --> 01:32.394
What if someone digs it up?

01:34.870 --> 01:37.737
May God have mercy
on his soul.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.232
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

02:13.308 --> 02:15.674
- Good afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

02:23.452 --> 02:26.250
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

02:40.669 --> 02:43.433
Get him!

02:48.310 --> 02:51.074
Prepare to die, Parrish!

02:52.514 --> 02:54.982
Hey, Parrish,
what's the rush?

03:01.957 --> 03:03.652
He's goin' to
his dad's factory!

03:05.861 --> 03:08.591
Alan wants his daddy now!

03:21.109 --> 03:25.273
Go ahead, Parrish.
Run to Daddy. We'll be waiting.

03:46.301 --> 03:49.998
- Hi, Carl.
- Hey, Alan, I gotta show you something.

03:50.072 --> 03:53.599
Come here. Now, I've been
working on this for almost a year.

03:53.675 --> 03:58.305
I got an appointment this afternoon
with your father to show him this.

03:58.380 --> 04:01.110
Go ahead. Take it.

04:01.183 --> 04:03.344
So what do ya think?
Ya think he'II like it?

04:04.720 --> 04:06.688
- What is it?
- What is it?

04:06.755 --> 04:10.350
Man, this is the future. If I can
get Wilt Chamberlain to wear 'em...

04:10.425 --> 04:13.952
I predict there'll be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

04:14.029 --> 04:16.156
That's gonna be
the height of fashion.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.132
What's wrong?

04:21.536 --> 04:24.164
- Nothin'.
- Alan!

04:25.274 --> 04:27.742
Thanks, Bob.
What are you doing here?

04:27.809 --> 04:31.142
I've told you before. This factory
isn't a playground. It's dangerous.

04:31.213 --> 04:34.649
- Dad, can I have a ride home?
- Look, Alan.

04:34.716 --> 04:37.685
Is Billy Jessup
picking on you again?

04:39.421 --> 04:42.117
Son, you're gonna have to
face him sooner or later.

04:42.190 --> 04:46.854
Look, if you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

04:47.796 --> 04:50.060
Now, run on, son.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.701
Carl, you should know better
than to let the boy play in here.

04:53.769 --> 04:55.862
Sorry, sir.

04:55.938 --> 04:59.874
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.

05:07.983 --> 05:09.712
What the devil...

05:12.854 --> 05:14.446
Get an extinguisher.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.726
Who did this?

05:27.602 --> 05:29.297
Well?

05:32.808 --> 05:34.241
I did, sir.

05:48.156 --> 05:51.717
Just because you're a Parrish doesn't
mean you can hang around my girlfriend.

05:52.527 --> 05:56.554
- We're just friends.
- Not anymore. Get him!

06:01.570 --> 06:03.401
- Let's go!
- Okay, I've got his bike.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.844
Jerks!

08:07.262 --> 08:08.695
Wow.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.511
Neat.

09:06.521 --> 09:09.490
Alan. Are you home?

09:17.165 --> 09:21.534
Oh, Alan, not again.
Come on.

09:24.706 --> 09:27.436
Hard work, determination,
a cheerful outlook...

09:27.509 --> 09:30.376
attributes that have exemplified
the Brantford spirit...

09:30.445 --> 09:34.347
since our forefathers
first settled this town.

09:34.416 --> 09:38.614
Despite the harshness of our native
clime and the granite of our soil...

09:38.687 --> 09:41.781
- we have...
- Prospered.

09:41.856 --> 09:45.883
- I knew the damn thing this morning.
- You'll know the darn thing tonight.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.863
- All right. Let's go.
- Sam. We have to talk to Alan.

09:56.137 --> 10:00.631
- Well, we're on our way.
- Okay.

10:00.709 --> 10:04.975
I told your father what you told me this
afternoon. It wasn't just Billy Jessup.

10:05.046 --> 10:07.606
Look, if I'd known that,
Alan, I wouldn't have...

10:07.682 --> 10:11.345
- It's okay, Dad.
- I want you to know I am proud of you.

10:11.419 --> 10:14.149
I mean, you faced them, even
though you were outnumbered.

10:14.222 --> 10:17.282
And since you
took it like a man...

10:17.359 --> 10:20.294
your mother and I have decided
that you're ready to go...

10:20.362 --> 10:22.660
to the Cliffside School for Boys.

10:22.731 --> 10:25.222
- There.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.767
- You don't want me living here anymore?
- Alan.

10:32.107 --> 10:34.905
It's always been the plan that you go
to Cliffside when you were ready.

10:34.976 --> 10:39.345
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

10:39.414 --> 10:42.349
Even your Uncle Skylar
went there.

10:42.417 --> 10:46.080
- Look at this. Parrish Hall.
- It's the main dormitory.

10:49.491 --> 10:53.689
Oh, this is great. Kids are on my
case here because I'm a Parrish.

10:53.762 --> 10:57.357
Just wait till I'm living in
a building named after me.

10:57.432 --> 10:59.866
It was named
after my father.

10:59.934 --> 11:03.392
- Good. Why don't you live in it?
- I did!

11:03.471 --> 11:06.463
I wouldn't be who I am today
if it weren't for my years there.

11:07.609 --> 11:11.875
Maybe I don't wanna be who you are.
Maybe I don't wanna be a Parrish.

11:14.516 --> 11:17.679
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.947
Get your coat!

11:23.758 --> 11:26.192
I guess I'm not ready
for Cliffside then!

11:26.261 --> 11:30.994
We're taking you there next Sunday! I
don't wanna hear another word about it!

11:31.066 --> 11:35.230
You won't.
I'm never talking to you again!

11:40.875 --> 11:42.740
- Sam...
- Don't!

11:42.811 --> 11:45.177
- Sam...
- What?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.508
Nothing. Just...

12:13.475 --> 12:17.172
- What are you doing here?
- I brought your bike back.

12:17.245 --> 12:21.306
You didn't have to. I was going
over to Billy's to get it myself.

12:21.383 --> 12:25.217
I told Billy to stop
picking on you.

12:25.286 --> 12:29.017
You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
We'll talk about this some other time.

12:30.091 --> 12:31.524
What was that?

12:33.595 --> 12:36.223
- You heard it too?
- Of course I heard it.

12:37.532 --> 12:40.899
Come on. I found this weird game
in the factory.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.698
A game?

12:59.587 --> 13:00.713
"Jumanji.

13:00.789 --> 13:05.385
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

13:05.460 --> 13:09.055
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

13:09.130 --> 13:12.429
And the first player to reach
the end wins." You wanna play?

13:12.500 --> 13:16.266
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

13:19.274 --> 13:21.208
Sarah.

13:26.881 --> 13:31.045
- It's gotta be magnetized or something.
- Alan, look.

13:33.621 --> 13:36.886
"At night they fly,
you better run...

13:36.958 --> 13:40.655
these winged things
are not much fun."

13:47.902 --> 13:51.269
- What was that?
- I don't know.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.265
- Put it away, Alan!
- Okay.

14:01.916 --> 14:04.783
Oh, no.
The game thinks I rolled.

14:05.687 --> 14:07.951
What do you mean,
"The game thinks"?

14:10.625 --> 14:12.991
"In the jungle you must wait...

14:13.061 --> 14:17.054
until the dice
read five or eight."

14:18.299 --> 14:21.894
"In the jungle you must wait..."
What's that mean?

14:40.522 --> 14:43.685
Roll the dice!

15:22.263 --> 15:25.562
I think a bed-and-breakfast
is just what this town needs.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.399
Well, it's pretty hard to pass up,
especially full of furniture.

15:29.470 --> 15:33.566
Oh, boy! I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.235
Judy, Peter,
come look at this.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.575
I'm gonna put
a reception area over here.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.641
And a bar over here
in the parlor.

15:46.688 --> 15:51.318
That sounds lovely. I'm sure you and
your kids are gonna be very happy here.

15:51.392 --> 15:55.886
Oh. Well, actually,
they're my late brother's.

15:55.964 --> 15:58.899
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

16:02.937 --> 16:04.768
Is this something,
or what?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.108
It sure is.

16:22.256 --> 16:25.282
So, what do you think, young man?
Is it big enough for you?

16:36.771 --> 16:39.831
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

16:42.543 --> 16:46.707
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.

16:47.782 --> 16:51.878
It's okay.
We barely even knew our parents.

16:51.953 --> 16:56.754
They were always away... skiing in
Saint Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo...

16:56.824 --> 17:00.760
safariing in darkest Africa.

17:00.828 --> 17:04.263
We didn't even know
if they loved us.

17:04.332 --> 17:07.267
But when the sheik's yacht
went down, well...

17:07.335 --> 17:10.361
they managed to write us
a really beautiful good-bye note...

17:10.438 --> 17:15.102
that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

17:15.175 --> 17:16.438
Excuse me.

17:24.452 --> 17:28.387
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

17:28.455 --> 17:31.482
- So you'll send me those escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

18:03.925 --> 18:06.587
I'll have to get a locksmith
out for this one.

18:06.661 --> 18:09.186
Peter, pick up your toys,
please.

18:16.037 --> 18:19.131
Peter, take this suitcase
up to the attic.

18:19.207 --> 18:22.665
Then we can all have
ice cream and bourbon.

18:49.871 --> 18:51.805
What? What is it?

18:52.940 --> 18:56.376
- I'm going to Motel 6.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

19:22.336 --> 19:25.032
I don't see any guano.

19:29.844 --> 19:33.541
- He said it looked like that.
- That's an African bat.

19:33.614 --> 19:36.310
Some kid said she saw a bunch
of those back in the '60s.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.785
But we don't get bats
like that in New England.

19:39.854 --> 19:43.722
- But that's what he saw.
- Well, whatever it was...

19:43.791 --> 19:46.282
is gone now.

19:46.360 --> 19:50.421
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house anyways.

19:50.498 --> 19:52.295
What would you worry about?

19:52.366 --> 19:54.459
Well, personally...

19:54.535 --> 19:57.561
I wouldn't wanna live in a house
where someone was murdered.

20:00.274 --> 20:01.673
- Murdered?
- Yep.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.734
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

20:05.613 --> 20:09.913
There's a thousand and one places he
could have hid the body in this house.

20:10.985 --> 20:13.954
Especially if he
chopped it up first.

20:14.021 --> 20:18.583
Hey, up there! You kids don't wanna
be late for your first day of school.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.760
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Ya hear that?

20:25.833 --> 20:29.564
There is nothing
to be afraid of in this house.

20:55.930 --> 20:59.491
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after the first day.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.159
What am I gonna do?

21:03.471 --> 21:08.238
Let's just try to relax and finish our
dinner and talk about something else.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.743
Well, we found out why
you got this house so cheap.

21:10.811 --> 21:15.407
Twenty-six years ago, a kid named
Alan Parrish used to live here.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.678
Then one day,
he just disappeared...

21:17.752 --> 21:21.711
'cause his parents chopped him up in
little pieces and hid him in the walls.

21:21.789 --> 21:25.725
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired of
your lies, young lady. You're grounded.

21:29.130 --> 21:32.827
Fine. There's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

21:32.900 --> 21:36.700
And just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

22:13.774 --> 22:17.266
Did you hear anything
a little while ago?

22:20.014 --> 22:22.414
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

22:24.018 --> 22:26.987
- No.
- Liar.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.649
If you don't cut that out,
they're gonna send you to a shrink.

22:30.725 --> 22:34.456
Where do you think they're gonna
send you if you don't start talking?

22:51.979 --> 22:55.676
If I get held up at the permit office,
I'll give you a call.

22:55.750 --> 22:59.015
School bus should be here
any minute.

23:00.621 --> 23:02.521
You guys still have
your house keys?

23:02.590 --> 23:05.582
You guys listening to me?

23:06.894 --> 23:08.828
Hello?

23:10.197 --> 23:12.631
- Hello?
- What?

23:14.502 --> 23:16.766
Maybe I should wait
with you till the bus comes.

23:16.837 --> 23:20.864
Did your parents used
to put you on the bus?

23:20.941 --> 23:23.466
- No. No.
- Are you sure?

23:24.812 --> 23:26.370
I could drop you off.

23:26.447 --> 23:30.474
No, don't worry about us.
The bus'll be here any minute.

23:30.551 --> 23:33.782
Okay.
Please be good today.

23:44.231 --> 23:47.257
- You do hear it.
- Hear what?

24:02.683 --> 24:04.617
Where's it coming from?

24:35.182 --> 24:37.116
Wow.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.584
Let's bring it over here.

24:52.299 --> 24:55.166
Weird. They're stuck.

24:55.236 --> 24:59.696
"Jumanji. A game for those who seek to
find a way to leave their world behind.

24:59.773 --> 25:02.571
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles get another turn.

25:02.643 --> 25:05.942
The first player
to reach the end wins."

25:11.285 --> 25:13.981
It's gotta be microchips
or something.

25:15.823 --> 25:17.984
You go first.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.094
Okay.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.592
Six.

25:38.345 --> 25:42.839
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

26:20.621 --> 26:22.145
Don't!

26:27.361 --> 26:29.727
"This will not be
an easy mission...

26:29.797 --> 26:32.493
monkeys slow the expedition."

26:35.903 --> 26:38.531
What is that?

27:18.779 --> 27:22.909
I bet those monkeys came from the game.
The mosquitoes too.

27:24.852 --> 27:28.253
Uh-oh.
I didn't see this part.

27:31.759 --> 27:34.387
"Adventurers beware."

27:39.633 --> 27:44.798
"Adventurers beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.602
The exciting consequences
of the game will vanish...

27:47.675 --> 27:50.906
only when a player has reached
Jumanji and called out its name."

27:50.978 --> 27:53.105
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.273
- Put it away.
- Wait!

27:55.349 --> 27:58.113
The instructions say if we
finish the game, it'll all go away.

27:58.185 --> 28:00.585
We better do it,
or Aunt Nora's gonna pitch a fit.

28:00.654 --> 28:04.317
We should just get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

28:06.593 --> 28:10.654
No, you rolled doubles.
You get another turn.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.289
Roll!

28:13.367 --> 28:14.493
Five.

28:18.072 --> 28:22.236
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

28:22.309 --> 28:26.575
Your party better move
poste haste."

28:26.647 --> 28:29.275
I don't like the sound of that.

28:31.819 --> 28:33.252
Judy, someone's in here.

28:54.007 --> 28:57.875
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.

28:58.245 --> 29:00.611
Run, Peter!

30:36.610 --> 30:38.544
I'm back.

31:31.698 --> 31:34.861
Somebody roll
a five or an eight?

31:36.537 --> 31:38.471
He did.

31:45.045 --> 31:47.741
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

31:51.218 --> 31:54.278
Thank you.
Sorry if I scared you.

31:54.354 --> 31:56.618
Sorry if I scared you.
Thank you.

31:56.690 --> 32:00.717
I'm back! Mom! Dad!

32:02.596 --> 32:05.190
I'm home!

32:05.265 --> 32:07.790
I'm back!

32:07.868 --> 32:12.100
It's me!
It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

32:12.172 --> 32:15.232
I'm home! I'm back.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.938
Are you my little sister?

32:19.012 --> 32:22.379
No.
I'm Judy and he's Peter.

32:22.449 --> 32:25.077
Where's Mom?
Is Dad at the factory?

32:26.219 --> 32:29.882
Are you Alan Parrish?

32:29.957 --> 32:33.085
Yeah.
Who are you?

32:33.160 --> 32:35.094
We live here now.

32:36.430 --> 32:40.264
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We don't know.

32:41.568 --> 32:44.969
This house has been empty
for years.

32:45.038 --> 32:47.438
Everyone thought you were dead.

32:58.352 --> 32:59.876
Sorry.

33:05.359 --> 33:08.226
<i>- Gimme that description again.</i>
- I said, red fur and long fail.

33:18.338 --> 33:21.102
Get down off of my car, please.

33:21.174 --> 33:23.267
And get up on the sidewalk.

33:25.345 --> 33:28.280
- What year is it?
- It was brand new.

33:28.348 --> 33:31.909
No.
What year is it?

33:31.985 --> 33:34.886
- Uh, 1995, remember?
- '95.

33:34.955 --> 33:39.153
You got some I. D? Oh, let me guess.
You left it in your other Tarzan outfit?

33:39.226 --> 33:42.354
- Twenty-six years.
- Are you from around here?

33:42.429 --> 33:45.694
I was!
But I've been in Jumanji.

33:45.766 --> 33:48.428
Indonesia.
He was in the Peace Corps.

33:50.470 --> 33:51.994
Bentley.

33:55.742 --> 33:59.041
- Carl Bentley, the Soleman.
- Is this man related to you?

33:59.112 --> 34:03.276
- Yes, sir. He's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

34:03.350 --> 34:06.012
Well, yeah,
he's a vegetarian.

34:06.086 --> 34:08.246
Get out of there!

34:14.061 --> 34:16.824
Monkeys! Monkeys.

34:17.797 --> 34:19.527
Is he all right upstairs?

34:19.599 --> 34:23.763
Uh, he suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

34:33.447 --> 34:36.938
Hey! Hey... What?

34:37.016 --> 34:40.817
Don't you move!
Freeze! Hey!

34:40.887 --> 34:42.855
Don't move. Don't move.

34:43.724 --> 34:47.989
- Wait a minute! Where are you going?
- To find my parents!

34:49.362 --> 34:51.226
Come on.

35:17.557 --> 35:18.854
Wait!

36:13.480 --> 36:15.948
My dad used to
make shoes here.

36:17.484 --> 36:19.577
They were the best shoes
in New England.

36:22.823 --> 36:24.256
Hey!

36:31.164 --> 36:32.290
Sorry.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.331
Easy, girl.

36:41.107 --> 36:43.974
Do you know what happened
to this shoe factory?

36:45.245 --> 36:50.046
Yeah, it folded up,
like everything else in this town.

36:50.116 --> 36:53.608
Hey, it's pretty cold out there.
How 'bout some coffee?

36:53.687 --> 36:56.747
Why would they close
Parrish Shoes?

36:57.557 --> 37:01.960
When his kid ran away, Sam put
all he had into trying to find him.

37:02.028 --> 37:04.053
His time, his money.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.121
Everything.

37:06.199 --> 37:09.327
After a while,
he stopped comin' to work.

37:09.402 --> 37:12.701
He just quit carin'.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.902
I don't think anybody
loved his boy more than Sam did.

37:18.712 --> 37:20.646
Here.

37:22.515 --> 37:25.040
You're gonna freeze out there.

37:26.353 --> 37:30.050
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

37:30.991 --> 37:34.017
- I see 'em now and then.
- Yeah?

37:35.228 --> 37:36.820
They're over on Adams Street.

37:55.849 --> 37:57.942
Our parents are dead too.

38:00.287 --> 38:03.484
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when...

38:09.930 --> 38:12.364
Our dad was in advertising.

38:14.200 --> 38:18.603
I bet you miss him, huh?
Me too.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.776
There he goes again.

38:27.180 --> 38:31.082
Listen, I know you're upset and all, but
I kinda feel we should finish the game.

38:31.151 --> 38:33.449
We?
Why do you need me?

38:33.520 --> 38:36.489
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

38:36.556 --> 38:39.320
Plus, there's a lion in my aunt's
bedroom. What should I do about that?

38:39.392 --> 38:43.089
- Do I look like a Ringling Brother?
- But she'll be home soon.

38:43.163 --> 38:46.997
Won't she be surprised.
Hope she's not allergic to cats.

39:01.781 --> 39:04.750
Larry, we need the wheels.
Gimme a hand.

39:04.818 --> 39:06.752
Did we hit her that hard?

39:06.820 --> 39:09.880
No, it looks like another one
of those weird bites.

39:16.296 --> 39:17.627
It's another one.

39:17.697 --> 39:20.689
Geez, that's over 50.
What the hell's goin' on?

39:20.767 --> 39:22.029
Easy now.

39:22.102 --> 39:25.299
- Hey, look. Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

39:25.372 --> 39:28.671
- The realtor.
- Quiet. Listen.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.233
You hear that?

39:31.311 --> 39:35.008
- Hear what?
- Get in the car.

39:41.021 --> 39:44.616
Okay, think.
What came out of the game before me?

39:44.691 --> 39:48.991
- There was a lion, a bunch of monkeys...
- That!

39:51.364 --> 39:54.629
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a bug.

39:54.701 --> 39:58.330
But we're safe in here.
See? We're fine.

40:01.041 --> 40:05.501
As long as we stay low, he can't get
through there too far. Don't worry.

40:05.578 --> 40:07.307
We're fine.

40:07.380 --> 40:10.440
Hey, he can't get us in here.
He can't get through the glass.

40:11.251 --> 40:12.684
We're safe.

40:15.388 --> 40:19.722
Either one of you know how to drive?
No? Well, that's no problem.

40:19.793 --> 40:25.231
Well, my dad used to let me back
the car down the driveway once.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.357
- So what's the big deal?
- Buckle up.

40:27.434 --> 40:30.130
Here we go!

40:32.439 --> 40:35.875
Oh, wait a minute.
What... Wait.

40:41.114 --> 40:42.672
Alan, the top!

41:00.066 --> 41:02.000
Piece of cake.

41:03.937 --> 41:05.063
Yeah.

41:22.822 --> 41:25.791
Keep that thing away from me!

41:26.626 --> 41:28.685
When are you gonna
help us play?

41:28.761 --> 41:31.355
We've gotta hurry.
Our aunt's gonna be home soon.

41:31.431 --> 41:35.891
Well, good. You can inform her
that she's the ex-owner of this house.

41:35.969 --> 41:40.338
I hope you realize, with my parents
gone, this home belongs to me.

41:43.877 --> 41:46.869
Oh, thank you.

41:46.946 --> 41:48.880
No more banana leaves.

41:55.555 --> 41:58.820
What do you think those monkeys are
gonna do to the ecosystem around here?

41:58.892 --> 42:01.019
<i>Just sit right back</i>
and you'll hear a tale

42:01.094 --> 42:03.585
<i>- A tale of a fateful trip</i>
- Hello!

42:03.663 --> 42:06.564
<i>That started out on this tropic port</i>
aboard this tiny ship

42:06.633 --> 42:09.227
<i>The mate was</i>
a mighty sailor man

42:09.302 --> 42:11.395
<i>The skipper</i>
brave and sure

42:11.471 --> 42:15.840
<i>Five passengers set sail that day</i>
for a three-hour four

42:33.226 --> 42:36.992
What happened to you?
You shave with a piece of glass?

42:37.063 --> 42:39.896
What happened to you?
The Clampetts have a yard sale?

42:41.067 --> 42:43.001
What do you want?
I've never shaved before.

42:43.903 --> 42:45.029
Where are you going?

42:45.939 --> 42:50.069
How 'bout Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

42:50.143 --> 42:51.701
No, thanks.
I've seen it.

42:53.079 --> 42:55.843
So if you're not gonna help us,
what are you gonna do?

42:55.915 --> 42:59.749
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

42:59.819 --> 43:02.686
I wonder if Mrs. Nedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

43:12.198 --> 43:15.099
Come on, Judy.
He's not gonna help us. He's afraid.

43:16.236 --> 43:18.227
What did you say?

43:19.472 --> 43:22.032
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.

43:25.778 --> 43:28.076
Let's go set it up
in the living room.

43:30.450 --> 43:33.908
No, you have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

43:33.987 --> 43:38.321
Whatever it is, we'll handle it
by ourselves. We don't need your help.

43:38.391 --> 43:40.222
I don't think so.

43:40.293 --> 43:44.855
You think monkeys,
mosquitoes and lions are bad?

43:44.931 --> 43:47.957
That's just the beginning.

43:48.034 --> 43:51.834
I've seen things you've only
seen in your nightmares.

43:51.904 --> 43:55.169
Things you can't even imagine.

43:55.241 --> 43:57.675
Things you can't even see.

43:57.744 --> 44:02.010
There are things that'll
hunt you in the night.

44:02.081 --> 44:06.450
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eat.

44:06.519 --> 44:10.512
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

44:10.590 --> 44:13.150
Afraid?

44:13.226 --> 44:16.354
You don't even know
what afraid is.

44:16.429 --> 44:19.262
You will not last
five minutes without me.

44:20.099 --> 44:24.229
So are you gonna help us?

44:26.673 --> 44:28.607
I'll watch.

44:32.779 --> 44:34.713
But I'm not afraid.

44:44.624 --> 44:47.752
Peter, that was very cool.

44:47.827 --> 44:52.594
That's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

44:52.665 --> 44:56.294
- Ready?
- Yeah.

44:57.203 --> 44:58.864
Alan, ready?

44:58.938 --> 45:00.872
There is no "ready."

45:10.817 --> 45:12.910
I'll try it again.

45:20.793 --> 45:22.454
It's not working.

45:30.903 --> 45:34.339
Oh, no. It's not your turn.

45:34.407 --> 45:36.432
Yeah. I rolled first...

45:36.509 --> 45:39.478
and then Peter twice 'cause he got
doubles, and now it's my turn again.

45:40.980 --> 45:44.575
No, look. Two of those
pieces are yours, right?

45:44.650 --> 45:45.912
Whose are the other pieces?

45:49.555 --> 45:51.022
The elephant was mine.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.186
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

45:59.165 --> 46:01.258
I'm gonna have to play.

46:05.772 --> 46:08.297
It's not my turn.

46:08.374 --> 46:10.308
Whose turn is it?

46:13.813 --> 46:16.043
Sarah Whittle.

46:23.790 --> 46:25.883
This is where
she used to live.

46:27.427 --> 46:29.520
This place gives me the creeps.

46:40.940 --> 46:43.033
We used to play
on this porch.

46:45.912 --> 46:48.278
I knew she still
wouldn't live here.

46:48.347 --> 46:51.077
Probably married Billy Jessup and
they're living in a trailer park.

46:51.150 --> 46:54.210
- Let's go.
- Maybe she'II know where Sarah went.

46:54.287 --> 46:56.983
Of course she'll know where Sarah went.
She's a psychic.

46:57.056 --> 46:58.523
Good point.

47:01.794 --> 47:04.194
- I remember the porch being bigger.
- Hello?

47:05.665 --> 47:09.260
- Um, can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

47:09.335 --> 47:11.565
No, we're just trying
to find someone.

47:11.637 --> 47:15.767
- Madam Serena can't see you right now.
- Maybe you can help us.

47:19.512 --> 47:21.173
What is it?

47:21.247 --> 47:23.374
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

47:23.449 --> 47:26.043
No, I've lived here
my whole life.

47:26.118 --> 47:28.586
Well, then you must know
Sarah Whittle.

47:33.526 --> 47:35.619
What do you want
with Sarah Whittle?

47:40.399 --> 47:42.663
No, I don't go
by that name anymore.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.263
What do you want?

47:50.276 --> 47:54.713
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

47:56.916 --> 47:59.350
A game with drums.

48:03.823 --> 48:05.256
How do you know that?

48:07.093 --> 48:09.789
I was that little boy,
Sarah.

48:21.908 --> 48:24.468
You killed her.

48:25.545 --> 48:27.706
<i>Leave a message and the docfor</i>
will call you back...

48:27.780 --> 48:30.647
<i>at his earliest convenience.</i>

48:30.716 --> 48:32.775
<i>Dr. Boorstein.</i>
Sarah Whittle calling.

48:32.852 --> 48:35.252
If you could call me back
as soon as you can...

48:35.321 --> 48:38.222
I think I need to have
my dosage checked.

48:38.291 --> 48:40.384
That event we've been discussing
for a long time now...

48:40.459 --> 48:43.053
the one that
didn't really happen...

48:43.129 --> 48:47.031
I'm havin' an episode here with the
little boy that didn't really disappear.

48:47.099 --> 48:50.262
I'm sittin' in his living room
drinkin' lemonade.

48:50.336 --> 48:53.635
If you could call me, I'd really
be interested in your interpretation.

48:53.706 --> 48:57.403
Thank you so much. He'II call me back
ten minutes before the hour.

48:57.476 --> 49:00.240
- While we're waiting...
- Whoa, God!

49:00.313 --> 49:02.907
- Sarah!
- No, no, no, no!

49:02.982 --> 49:06.076
- Sarah, please!
- I spent over 2,000 hours in therapy...

49:06.152 --> 49:08.245
convincing myself that
that doesn't exist.

49:08.321 --> 49:10.312
What happened to you was so awful,
I made up that whole thing.

49:10.389 --> 49:14.348
- Sarah, it was awful. It really was.
- Am I crazy?

49:15.861 --> 49:18.159
It was real. Real.

49:18.230 --> 49:20.164
No, no, no.
It wasn't real.

49:20.232 --> 49:22.666
Your father murdered you and
chopped you up in little pieces.

49:22.735 --> 49:27.729
Sarah, come on.
My dad did that?

49:27.807 --> 49:31.402
My father could
barely hug me...

49:31.477 --> 49:33.843
let alone cut me
into little pieces.

49:33.913 --> 49:36.541
Twenty-six years ago...

49:36.616 --> 49:39.483
we started playing
a little game.

49:39.552 --> 49:43.386
And now we're all
gonna sit down...

49:43.456 --> 49:45.390
and we're
gonna finish it.

49:45.458 --> 49:48.586
And guess what?
Your turn.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.931
No!

49:59.705 --> 50:01.138
Play the game.

50:01.207 --> 50:04.142
- Oh, no, no, no.
- All right.

50:05.811 --> 50:10.271
Just gimme the dice and you can go home.
You don't have to play.

50:10.349 --> 50:11.976
Thank you, Alan.

50:13.519 --> 50:15.885
Oh, my God!
How could you do that?

50:15.955 --> 50:19.391
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You'll get used to it.

50:19.458 --> 50:23.588
And I think of all the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit.

50:23.663 --> 50:25.130
Go on, read it.

50:30.903 --> 50:35.840
"They grow much faster than bamboo.
Take care or they'll come after you."

50:38.878 --> 50:43.747
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.

50:43.816 --> 50:45.750
Oh, it is.

50:45.818 --> 50:48.582
Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

50:48.654 --> 50:50.986
No quick movements.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.257
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- Oh, yeah, they're beautiful.

50:59.331 --> 51:02.528
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

51:02.601 --> 51:04.762
And definitely
stay away from the pods.

51:04.837 --> 51:06.930
The big yellow ones.

51:07.006 --> 51:09.133
What big yellow ones?

51:12.511 --> 51:14.411
Peter!

51:14.480 --> 51:16.607
I got ya!
Get his arms!

51:16.682 --> 51:18.877
Get it off me!

51:27.426 --> 51:28.586
Oh, my God!

51:35.434 --> 51:37.800
- Hang on, boy.
- Grab him!

51:37.870 --> 51:39.633
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, my God!

51:41.440 --> 51:42.702
Sorry, Angus.

51:46.312 --> 51:49.145
Whoa. Harvest time!

51:57.356 --> 51:59.017
Are you okay?

52:07.299 --> 52:08.732
Oh, my God!

52:09.769 --> 52:13.466
My car.
Oh, my car.

52:14.807 --> 52:17.708
<i>Has anybody seen Carl?</i>

52:17.777 --> 52:20.473
<i>- I can't believe this. Start. Please.</i>
- Carl, come in please.

52:24.183 --> 52:26.583
<i>- Carl here.</i>
- Where have you been?

52:26.652 --> 52:29.018
<i>We've got a serious</i>
animal control situation.

52:29.088 --> 52:31.886
You gotta get Stan and Willy on it.
I'm headin' to the old Parrish place...

52:31.957 --> 52:34.152
to check a suspicious character.

52:36.295 --> 52:37.887
I should've been a fireman.

52:51.277 --> 52:52.869
Get your hands off me!

52:52.945 --> 52:56.278
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
- It is for me.

52:56.348 --> 53:01.342
You are not in the jungle anymore. Stop
this! You don't treat people like this.

53:15.601 --> 53:19.093
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

53:24.610 --> 53:28.171
Alan, please. Last time I played
this game, it ruined my life.

53:29.515 --> 53:32.313
It ruined your life?

53:32.384 --> 53:36.650
"In the jungle you must wait,
till the dice read five or eight."

53:37.823 --> 53:40.792
I was a little girl, Alan.

53:40.860 --> 53:43.795
You disappeared.

53:43.863 --> 53:48.459
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

53:49.468 --> 53:50.696
I was afraid.

53:52.037 --> 53:54.335
I'm sorry, Alan.

53:54.406 --> 53:57.204
No one believed me.
I was all alone.

53:57.276 --> 53:59.210
So was I.

53:59.278 --> 54:01.712
For 26 years, Sarah.

54:03.449 --> 54:06.646
Me too.

54:06.719 --> 54:10.155
It's okay, Sarah.
We're scared too.

54:10.222 --> 54:13.623
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

54:13.692 --> 54:17.753
- What if I get stuck in the game?
- You won't.

54:19.765 --> 54:21.960
Because I won't stop playing.

54:22.034 --> 54:25.401
- And neither will I.
- I won't either.

54:33.646 --> 54:36.581
- Come on, Sarah.
- Please?

54:45.591 --> 54:47.252
I knew this was
gonna be a bad day.

54:48.761 --> 54:51.355
Hey, come on.
We'II be fine.

54:51.430 --> 54:53.557
We just have to
keep our heads.

54:55.801 --> 54:57.291
Roll with the punches.

55:15.654 --> 55:20.648
"A hunter from
the darkest wild...

55:20.726 --> 55:24.526
makes you feel
just like a child."

55:24.596 --> 55:28.589
- What is it?
- Van Pelt.

55:35.040 --> 55:39.306
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

55:47.853 --> 55:49.821
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

55:49.888 --> 55:52.220
Coming, ready or not.

56:11.210 --> 56:12.973
Hey, you!

56:17.249 --> 56:19.911
Drop your gun and get
your hands in the air!

56:45.644 --> 56:48.135
Man, I don't believe this.

56:56.455 --> 56:59.151
Even if Alan gets out of this,
the same kind of thing's...

56:59.224 --> 57:01.158
gonna happen over and over again.

57:01.226 --> 57:06.459
When you carry around so much anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy.

57:06.532 --> 57:10.161
And things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

57:10.235 --> 57:12.829
- There are no accidents.
- Whose turn is it?

57:12.905 --> 57:16.500
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

57:16.575 --> 57:19.408
You might have told us there was a man
in there with a rifle that hunts people.

57:19.478 --> 57:22.413
I didn't know, okay?
It's just the roll of the dice.

57:22.481 --> 57:24.949
Is he the reason
you didn't wanna play?

57:27.386 --> 57:29.479
You didn't wanna play either...

57:29.555 --> 57:33.548
Mr. We-Started-Something-26-Years-Ago-
And-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

57:36.195 --> 57:38.663
- What's the deal with you and this guy?
- He's a hunter.

57:38.730 --> 57:42.359
He kills things. Right now,
he wants to hunt me and kill me.

57:42.434 --> 57:44.902
- Why you?
- Why me? I don't know.

57:44.970 --> 57:47.905
Everything about me he finds offensive.
You think it'd be a waste of his time.

57:47.973 --> 57:51.602
- Maybe he needs something for his wall.
- It's your turn.

57:51.677 --> 57:54.771
You ever thought about sitting down
and talking about your differences?

57:54.847 --> 57:56.815
What, are you crazy?
The man has a gun.

57:56.882 --> 57:59.112
Don't ever call me crazy, Alan.

57:59.184 --> 58:01.778
Ever. 'Cause everyone in this town
has called me crazy...

58:01.854 --> 58:04.379
ever since I told the cops
you were sucked into a board game.

58:04.456 --> 58:07.789
- Maybe I should roll.
- You know what it's like to be known...

58:07.860 --> 58:09.885
as the little girl
who saw Alan Parrish murdered?

58:09.962 --> 58:12.453
You think anybody showed up
at my 14th birthday party?

58:12.531 --> 58:15.261
- Hello. I'm rolling now.
- Billy who?

58:15.334 --> 58:18.770
- I'm gonna roll.
- Are you an owl?

58:18.837 --> 58:21.431
- Dig into your higher consciousness...
- Here, just roll.

58:21.507 --> 58:24.738
And find the memory
of your old boyfriend.

58:24.810 --> 58:27.870
- The kid who stole your bicycle?
- No, the kid who took you to movies.

58:27.946 --> 58:30.437
"Don't be fooled.
It isn't thunder.

58:30.516 --> 58:32.541
Staying put
would be a blunder."

58:32.618 --> 58:34.518
- No, you're immature.
- You are.

58:34.586 --> 58:36.747
I know you are,
but what am I?

58:38.223 --> 58:40.054
Do you feel that?

58:41.126 --> 58:42.787
Listen.

59:05.050 --> 59:07.814
Run!
It's a stampede!

59:09.555 --> 59:11.113
The game!

59:17.996 --> 59:19.190
Don't look back!

59:46.024 --> 59:47.821
Not the game!

59:56.702 --> 59:59.296
Why didn't you
grab the game, Peter?

59:59.371 --> 01:00:01.134
Ignore him, honey.
He's a Libra.

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:03.470
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.277
<i>Judy, if's Aunt Nora.</i>
Where have you been?

01:00:09.348 --> 01:00:12.442
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

01:00:15.187 --> 01:00:16.586
Wait for me!

01:00:34.906 --> 01:00:38.103
- What can I do for you?
- I want a gross of these.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:41.668
You know, they stopped
making these in 1903.

01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:45.410
Damn. I shall need
a replacement weapon.

01:00:45.484 --> 01:00:47.042
There's a waiting period...

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:49.178
and you'll have to...

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:51.188
fill out these.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:54.522
Or I could fill these out.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.634
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

01:01:09.641 --> 01:01:12.735
You're not a postal worker,
are you?

01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:21.643
Quiet.

01:01:32.798 --> 01:01:34.322
Okay.

01:01:43.542 --> 01:01:44.509
No!

01:02:57.249 --> 01:02:59.843
- Peter, that was great.
- Are you okay?

01:02:59.918 --> 01:03:02.478
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

01:03:02.554 --> 01:03:04.749
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.

01:03:08.894 --> 01:03:12.091
It's nice work.
Come on, gimme the game. Let's go.

01:03:32.651 --> 01:03:34.380
Act natural.

01:03:38.256 --> 01:03:40.918
- Hey!
- Hide the game.

01:03:46.598 --> 01:03:50.125
I don't believe this. Every time
there's trouble, I run into you.

01:03:50.202 --> 01:03:53.069
Me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:53.138 --> 01:03:55.436
- I'm taking you in for questioning.
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:04:01.279 --> 01:04:03.975
Just a second.
You can't take him. He's...

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:06.745
- Her fiance.
- I thought he was your uncle.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.247
It's all right.
I'll be back soon.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.654
Blast.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:19.492
Remember you said you'd never
abandon your friends?

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:22.556
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:28.098
I suggest you all
go home now.

01:04:28.173 --> 01:04:29.663
Okay.

01:04:34.446 --> 01:04:37.472
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:39.779
We can't. We can't finish it
without him.

01:04:41.553 --> 01:04:43.487
What?

01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:47.421
What happened?

01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:50.689
I thought I could end the game.
I was only ten spaces away.

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:53.492
"A law of Jumanji
having been broken...

01:04:53.565 --> 01:04:55.931
you will slip back
even more than your token."

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.763
You tried to cheat?

01:04:58.837 --> 01:05:02.034
No. I tried to drop the dice
so they'd land on 12.

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:04.439
Oh, okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:08.845
Peter, your hands!
Look at your hands!

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.903
<i>Ray, come in, this is Willie.</i>

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.637
<i>They cleaned out Larry's Hardware,</i>
and they're headed for Parrish Common.

01:05:39.711 --> 01:05:43.579
<i>I can't stop 'em, Lorraine. You gotta</i>
get the Nafional Guard down here now!

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:46.344
What is this about?
I know you know.

01:05:46.418 --> 01:05:50.377
Yes, I do, but you wouldn't believe me
even if I told you, Carl.

01:05:50.455 --> 01:05:53.891
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

01:05:53.959 --> 01:05:55.859
I know a lot more than that.

01:05:55.927 --> 01:05:58.919
I know you used to work on the
stamping line at Parrish Shoes.

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:01.022
They used to call you
Soleman.

01:06:01.099 --> 01:06:03.727
Soleman.
Yeah, that's right.

01:06:03.802 --> 01:06:07.169
I was in there too, until
old man Parrish fired me.

01:06:07.238 --> 01:06:09.365
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:12.774
And I had something I could've turned
this whole town around.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:15.244
- Your shoes.
- Right.

01:06:15.313 --> 01:06:17.247
Listen, Carl...

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:21.619
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:24.917
but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:06:26.257 --> 01:06:29.749
- Sorry for what?
- It's me, Alan.

01:06:33.932 --> 01:06:36.400
Thank you.
Come on.

01:06:36.468 --> 01:06:40.234
- What's going on?
- Apparently there's a sale happening.

01:06:45.844 --> 01:06:48.813
You just saw three monkeys
go by on a motorcycle, didn't you?

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.814
- Yes.
- Good girl. Come on.

01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:55.544
Maybe we can bail him out
with a check.

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.144
Thanks.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:07:00.157
You tell that sniveling coward
from me, if he wants...

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:03.853
Give me that, boy!

01:08:05.223 --> 01:08:08.351
Hey! Help me!

01:08:08.426 --> 01:08:10.951
Get me outta here!

01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:13.862
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter. Come on.

01:08:42.227 --> 01:08:43.488
There it is!

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.392
Wait here.

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:56.100
Got ya, girlie.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:09:00.709
When Alan hears
of your predicament, he'll come.

01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:04.510
He doesn't know I'm here,
so this isn't gonna work. I'm going.

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:09.944
Don't move or I'II blow
your blinking brains out!

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.886
Call the cops!

01:09:11.956 --> 01:09:13.947
- That should do it, don't ya think?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:18.997 --> 01:09:20.430
Price check.

01:09:24.469 --> 01:09:27.700
If you let me go,
I can stop all this.

01:09:29.006 --> 01:09:31.532
<i>It sounds like something out of the</i>
Twilight Zone, but it's true.

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:34.203
Please.
You gotta help me on this.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:35.746
I know I'm gonna regret it.

01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:39.883
Just hold still.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.050
There. I let you go.
Now what are we gonna do?

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.654
- You are gonna stay here.
- Those are my keys!

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.318
It's for your own good.
You just stay there.

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:53.761
- My handcuff keys. Wait.
- This is something I have to do.

01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:56.062
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.

01:09:56.134 --> 01:10:00.867
<i>Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot</i>
involving a woman and two children.

01:10:00.939 --> 01:10:04.306
<i>Sounds like the armed perpetrator in</i>
the pith helmet and khakis you reported.

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:07.674
<i>- Carl? Come in, Carl.</i>
- Lorraine, come in. Lorraine!

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.736
- What's Sir Sav-a-Iot?
- It's a discount store.

01:10:09.814 --> 01:10:12.806
- Move over.
- Wait. Gently.

01:10:12.884 --> 01:10:14.647
All right.

01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:17.244
Don't worry.
I've done this before once.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.078
- Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?
- Monroe and Elm.

01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:47.276
- The Episcopal church.
- No, it's not a church anymore.

01:10:47.352 --> 01:10:50.685
Now it's a Speedy Burger, or it was.
I don't know what's left of it.

01:10:50.755 --> 01:10:52.347
People in this town
are goin' loopy.

01:11:04.936 --> 01:11:06.904
We got company.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.838
It's all right.
That's a traffic cop. He'll back us up.

01:12:03.161 --> 01:12:05.629
- Here's the game.
- Come on. Get outta here.

01:12:31.856 --> 01:12:34.086
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- I got it.

01:12:34.158 --> 01:12:35.785
Okay!

01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:45.625
Stop your cringing.
I could have shot you at any moment.

01:12:45.703 --> 01:12:47.068
Then why didn't you?

01:12:47.138 --> 01:12:49.800
You didn't roll the dice.
Alan did.

01:12:49.874 --> 01:12:52.172
There it is.
Hit the brakes.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:54.268
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' 'em.

01:12:54.345 --> 01:12:57.644
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' the brakes!

01:12:59.017 --> 01:13:01.008
He should be here any moment.

01:13:24.175 --> 01:13:25.540
You're all right?

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:28.340
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

01:13:30.982 --> 01:13:32.813
Oh, great.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.750
<i>So remember...</i>

01:13:36.821 --> 01:13:40.416
<i>circumstances are never ever</i>
out of your control.

01:13:41.492 --> 01:13:43.426
<i>End of tape three.</i>

01:13:45.163 --> 01:13:48.291
<i>... update on the events unfolding</i>
in Brantford, New Hampshire...

01:13:48.366 --> 01:13:51.267
<i>where at least 98 people have been</i>
hospitalized with symptoms...

01:13:51.335 --> 01:13:53.462
<i>ranging from fevers and rashes...</i>

01:13:53.538 --> 01:13:55.233
<i>to violent seizures.</i>

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.934
<i>Local resources have been</i>
strained to the breaking point.

01:13:58.009 --> 01:14:01.672
<i>State health officials are asking</i>
anyone experiencing symptoms...

01:14:01.746 --> 01:14:04.044
<i>to dial 9-1-1.</i>

01:14:49.427 --> 01:14:51.054
I got it.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.893
Alan, talk to him. Please?

01:14:55.967 --> 01:14:58.333
What? We don't have time
for this, okay?

01:14:58.402 --> 01:15:01.997
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

01:15:02.073 --> 01:15:04.439
- All right.
- Thank you.

01:15:08.446 --> 01:15:11.279
I warned you about this,
Peter.

01:15:11.349 --> 01:15:13.977
No, you wanted
to play the game.

01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:19.247
What, are you crying? You don't cry,
all right? You keep your chin up.

01:15:19.323 --> 01:15:21.917
Keep your chin up.

01:15:21.993 --> 01:15:24.928
Crying never helped anybody
do anything, okay?

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.427
You have a problem,
you face it like a man.

01:15:39.043 --> 01:15:41.136
I'm sorry.

01:15:41.212 --> 01:15:45.410
Twenty-six years buried in the jungle
and I still became my father.

01:15:45.483 --> 01:15:47.314
It's okay.
Come here. I'm sorry.

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:49.410
Hey.
It's all right.

01:15:49.487 --> 01:15:52.547
Remember what you told me?
It's all right to be afraid.

01:15:52.623 --> 01:15:55.091
It's not that.

01:15:55.159 --> 01:15:57.684
What is it?

01:16:09.307 --> 01:16:11.707
Okay. Ready?

01:16:15.146 --> 01:16:20.140
Don't worry. We're gonna have you turned
back into your old self in no time flat.

01:16:20.218 --> 01:16:22.846
'Cause we're gonna go in here,
and together...

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.445
we're gonna sit down,
we're gonna finish that game...

01:16:25.523 --> 01:16:28.515
no matter what.

01:16:40.504 --> 01:16:43.496
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

01:17:15.773 --> 01:17:17.934
Lorraine, this is Carl.

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:22.412
I know who's behind this. I'm headin'
to the Parrish place. Gimme backup.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.216
Wait!

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.123
- Now what?
- Stop!

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.126
Wait, stop!

01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:42.030
Is there a problem, ma'am?

01:17:42.099 --> 01:17:44.795
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:47.861
Jefferson Street.
The old Parrish place.

01:17:47.938 --> 01:17:50.463
Do you have children?
A boy and a girl?

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:54.534
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- Get in. I'II explain it on the way.

01:18:24.008 --> 01:18:26.602
Fine! Take it!

01:18:26.677 --> 01:18:28.770
We gotta get to that house.

01:18:34.485 --> 01:18:36.919
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

01:18:36.987 --> 01:18:40.115
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

01:18:41.459 --> 01:18:43.393
Okay, it's my turn.

01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:45.588
If you roll a 12, you win.

01:18:47.732 --> 01:18:50.292
Okay, ready? Here I go.

01:18:54.872 --> 01:18:55.861
It's okay.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.670
"Every month at the quarter moon...

01:18:58.743 --> 01:19:01.371
there'll be a monsoon...

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:03.436
in your lagoon."

01:19:03.514 --> 01:19:06.608
Monsoon.
Well, at least we're inside.

01:19:09.186 --> 01:19:10.983
Yeah, right.

01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:35.406
Well, a little rain
never hurt anybody.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:38.346
Yeah, but a lot could kill you.

01:19:47.758 --> 01:19:50.488
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground!

01:19:50.561 --> 01:19:53.724
- Okay.
- Come on! Stay together!

01:20:09.814 --> 01:20:10.906
You all right?

01:20:14.151 --> 01:20:16.085
Alan. What is that?

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:20.922
Swim! Go! Go!

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:28.388
Swim fast! Move!

01:20:31.168 --> 01:20:33.363
Keep goin'!

01:20:34.972 --> 01:20:37.964
Get on the table!
Peter, get out of the water!

01:20:41.645 --> 01:20:43.135
On the chandelier!

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:54.118
Come on, Sarah.

01:21:08.172 --> 01:21:10.140
Hang on, Sarah!

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.010
Are you okay?

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.652
Where is he?

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:47.210
Ma'am, step back and let me handle this,
please. It's probably nothing.

01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:49.337
They probably left the TV
on too loud.

01:21:54.184 --> 01:21:56.812
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:18.331
Give me your hand.

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:25.373
- Grab my hand!
- I got it! No!

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:49.533
Take the game.
Here you go.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.114
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:23:03.821 --> 01:23:06.449
Alan, you wrestled
an alligator for me.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.089
It was a crocodile.

01:23:11.161 --> 01:23:15.029
Alligators don't have
that little fringe on their hind leg.

01:23:16.133 --> 01:23:17.760
Come on.

01:23:20.938 --> 01:23:23.133
My mistake.

01:23:43.093 --> 01:23:44.287
Come on.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:52.262
Okay, it's my turn.

01:23:52.336 --> 01:23:56.773
I've got it. Colonel Mustard
in the library with a wrench.

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:01.601
Clue.

01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:16.687
"Beware the ground
on which you stand...

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.627
the floor is quicker
than the sand."

01:24:24.735 --> 01:24:27.329
- Help me.
- Okay. Stay calm.

01:24:27.404 --> 01:24:28.462
Don't struggle.

01:24:28.539 --> 01:24:30.530
- Stay calm.
- I'm calm.

01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:33.768
- Grab on!
- Pull.

01:24:33.844 --> 01:24:35.778
Okay, I got it.

01:24:35.846 --> 01:24:37.643
Pull!

01:24:40.984 --> 01:24:43.509
Stay calm!

01:24:43.587 --> 01:24:44.781
Come on.

01:24:45.823 --> 01:24:48.621
Oh, good!

01:24:50.861 --> 01:24:53.125
I got you.

01:24:53.197 --> 01:24:55.495
Stop giving me things
that come apart!

01:24:57.534 --> 01:25:01.129
- "There is a lesson..."
- All right.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:05.737
"There is a lesson
you will learn:

01:25:06.677 --> 01:25:07.803
I got you.

01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:13.143
Sometimes you must
go back a turn."

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.254
- Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:20.256
Oh, dear.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:23.418
Oh, thank you, Judy.
Thank you.

01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:25.223
That was quick thinking.

01:25:25.295 --> 01:25:28.093
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor...

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.099
so it's your turn, Peter.

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:31.794
Okay.

01:25:38.809 --> 01:25:40.834
I thought I lost you again.

01:25:40.911 --> 01:25:43.209
Thanks for stickin' around
this time.

01:25:48.819 --> 01:25:51.447
"Need a hand
while you just wait...

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:55.424
we'll help you out,
we each have eight."

01:26:04.501 --> 01:26:06.765
- What's that? What is it?
- Nothing.

01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:08.361
You don't go "Waah!"
For nothing.

01:26:10.841 --> 01:26:12.365
- Oh, my.
- Peter!

01:26:12.442 --> 01:26:15.411
My dad kept an ax
in the woodshed. Get it.

01:26:15.479 --> 01:26:17.572
- Okay.
- Hurry! Go, go, go!

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:30.185
Aunt Nora, it's me, Peter.

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:36.024
Oh, God!

01:27:36.093 --> 01:27:39.221
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

01:27:40.197 --> 01:27:41.721
- What?
- It's your turn.

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:44.733
- You can finish if you roll a 7.
- I can't roll!

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:47.565
Put the dice in your mouth...

01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:49.731
Bring the game!
Hurry!

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:07.419
- Judy, are you okay?
- I'm fine. Help them.

01:28:11.128 --> 01:28:13.426
Come on, Judy.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.233
Gimme the dice!

01:28:27.311 --> 01:28:29.336
"You're almost there
with much at stake...

01:28:30.314 --> 01:28:32.578
but now the ground
begins to quake."

01:28:36.119 --> 01:28:38.019
- Oh, my God!
- What?

01:28:43.493 --> 01:28:46.257
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:48.264
So do I.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:02.406
Our only chance is if
we finish the game!

01:29:02.479 --> 01:29:04.379
It's your turn!

01:29:04.448 --> 01:29:05.938
Oh, my God.

01:29:19.162 --> 01:29:22.563
- Get the game! The game!
- No, I won't let you go!

01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:53.253
Don't move!

01:29:57.734 --> 01:29:59.361
Stand up.

01:30:04.374 --> 01:30:06.205
What's in your hand?

01:30:08.678 --> 01:30:09.872
Drop it.

01:30:20.057 --> 01:30:22.150
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

01:30:22.225 --> 01:30:24.955
Game's up.
Stop running.

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:28.356
No.

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:33.666
- Aren't you afraid?
- I'm terrified.

01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:36.466
But my father told me...

01:30:37.674 --> 01:30:40.142
you should always face
what you're afraid of.

01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:48.510
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:51.886
Any last words?

01:31:02.299 --> 01:31:04.233
Jumanji.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.664
No, Alan!

01:32:41.531 --> 01:32:43.362
Forgot my speech notes.

01:32:47.571 --> 01:32:50.768
I'm so glad you're back.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.774
I've only been gone
five minutes.

01:32:54.644 --> 01:32:57.340
It seems like
a lot longer to me.

01:32:58.915 --> 01:33:01.941
I thought you told me you were never
gonna talk to me again.

01:33:05.755 --> 01:33:07.950
Whatever I said, Dad...

01:33:08.024 --> 01:33:10.356
I'm sorry.

01:33:12.729 --> 01:33:16.825
Look, Alan, I was angry.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.028
I'm sorry too. I'm sorry.

01:33:24.774 --> 01:33:28.801
You don't have to go to Cliffside
if you don't want to.

01:33:31.848 --> 01:33:35.306
Let's talk it over tomorrow,
man-to-man.

01:33:38.021 --> 01:33:40.046
How about father-to-son?

01:33:41.424 --> 01:33:44.086
All right.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.459
Hey, I gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.

01:33:49.633 --> 01:33:51.066
Dad?

01:33:55.105 --> 01:33:59.439
Back in 196...
I mean, today in the factory...

01:33:59.509 --> 01:34:01.773
it wasn't
Carl Bentley's fault.

01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:05.008
I put the shoe
on the conveyor belt.

01:34:07.284 --> 01:34:09.775
I'm glad you told me, son.

01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:11.787
Thanks.

01:34:12.922 --> 01:34:14.856
Bye, Dad.

01:34:14.924 --> 01:34:16.858
Good-bye.

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:28.637
Holy smokes!
Judy and Peter!

01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:32.808
They're not there.

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:36.403
It's 1969.

01:34:36.479 --> 01:34:39.107
They don't even exist yet.

01:35:08.812 --> 01:35:11.576
I'm starting to forget
what it's like to be a grown-up.

01:35:11.648 --> 01:35:15.482
That's okay. As long as
we don't forget each other.

01:35:15.552 --> 01:35:17.417
Or Judy and Peter.

01:35:18.955 --> 01:35:21.583
Alan, there's something
I've been wanting to do...

01:35:22.659 --> 01:35:26.288
and I better do it
before I feel too much like a kid.

01:35:45.382 --> 01:35:49.443
They probably don't teach
driver training in the sixth grade, huh?

01:35:51.521 --> 01:35:54.190
<i>God and sinners reconciled</i>

01:35:54.190 --> 01:35:55.487
<i>God and sinners reconciled</i>

01:35:55.558 --> 01:35:59.585
<i>Joyful all ye nations rise</i>

01:35:59.662 --> 01:36:04.463
<i>Join the triumph of the skies</i>

01:36:04.534 --> 01:36:08.334
Merry Christmas.
Want to try one of these?

01:36:08.405 --> 01:36:12.068
<i>Christ is born in Bethlehem</i>

01:36:12.142 --> 01:36:15.703
<i>Hark, he herald angels sing</i>

01:36:15.779 --> 01:36:19.510
No, Dad. It's a new cross-trainer.
It's doing fabulous.

01:36:19.582 --> 01:36:22.244
- It's not a bra. It's a shoe.
- Honey, they're here.

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:25.754
Dad, I gotta run. Merry Christmas.
We'll pick you up at the airport.

01:36:25.822 --> 01:36:29.121
You'll be the best
Christmas gift of all. Bye-bye.

01:36:29.192 --> 01:36:30.489
- They're here.
- Come on.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.993
Let's go.

01:36:34.230 --> 01:36:36.164
Pardon me.

01:36:36.232 --> 01:36:38.723
- Jim, glad you could make it.
- Thanks.

01:36:38.802 --> 01:36:41.327
- This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi, Martha. This is Sarah.

01:36:41.404 --> 01:36:43.531
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

01:36:44.441 --> 01:36:46.375
Oh, my God, there they are.

01:36:47.577 --> 01:36:49.044
How'd you know?

01:36:49.112 --> 01:36:52.570
A guess. A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

01:36:52.649 --> 01:36:54.742
You're right.
These are our children.

01:36:54.818 --> 01:36:58.117
Judy and Peter. Kids, say hi
to Mr. And Mrs. Parrish.

01:36:58.188 --> 01:37:01.385
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:37:02.692 --> 01:37:05.627
You're just like
we remembered you.

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:10.389
I feel like we know
so much about them...

01:37:10.467 --> 01:37:12.298
because, you know...

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:14.802
- You've told Alan so much about them.
- And I told her.

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.499
- Yeah.
- I'll go get the presents.

01:37:17.574 --> 01:37:19.064
Sure, honey.

01:37:19.142 --> 01:37:21.076
Well, we love children.

01:37:21.144 --> 01:37:23.806
- Merry Christmas.
- Cool!

01:37:26.816 --> 01:37:29.842
- When can you start?
- Martha and I were thinking...

01:37:29.919 --> 01:37:32.945
of taking a little skiing holiday
up in the Canadian Rockies.

01:37:33.022 --> 01:37:34.250
No!

01:37:36.526 --> 01:37:37.584
Sorry.

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:40.026
We... We just...

01:37:40.096 --> 01:37:43.224
Need you to get that marketing
done on the new line pronto.

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.862
No problem.
I could probably start next week.

01:37:46.936 --> 01:37:48.062
That'd be great.

01:37:48.137 --> 01:37:51.937
Let me introduce you to the rest of
the folks you'll be working with.

01:37:52.008 --> 01:37:54.636
Come on in.
Our house was your house.

01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:57.009
Is, anytime you like.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.447
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
We wish you a merry Christmas

01:38:00.517 --> 01:38:05.784
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
and a happy New Year
