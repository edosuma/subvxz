00:00.421 --> 00:04.059
You are Mr White's child
and you're to be married, are you not?

00:04.179 --> 00:05.878
Not as at 3 o'clock this afternoon.

00:05.998 --> 00:08.122
Why must it be the daughters who suffer?

00:08.243 --> 00:09.787
What you told me...

00:10.096 --> 00:12.360
***

00:12.480 --> 00:13.908
No brown, either.

00:14.028 --> 00:15.882
He was right on both counts.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.221
***

00:18.341 --> 00:21.607
**

00:21.727 --> 00:23.194

00:26.990 --> 00:29.463

00:29.583 --> 00:32.598

00:32.718 --> 00:36.283
***

00:36.403 --> 00:39.841
***

00:40.498 --> 00:41.414
Okay?

00:41.649 --> 00:43.845
It wasn't my son who died here.

00:43.965 --> 00:45.163
It was an innocent boy.

00:45.391 --> 00:46.758
His name was Roger.

00:47.127 --> 00:48.107
You get that?

00:48.464 --> 00:49.267
I did.

00:49.387 --> 00:51.411
I am with the Pinkerton Detective Agency.

00:51.531 --> 00:54.479
These men are my associates and witness to your confession to

00:54.599 --> 00:55.969
First degree murder.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.997
I know you like to relax.

00:58.051 --> 01:00.784
I've been meaning to talk to you
about expanding my role in your gang.

01:00.823 --> 01:02.993
You wouldn't squeeze me
out of my own operation...

01:03.003 --> 01:03.600
Get down!

01:06.650 --> 01:07.839
Lucky for Johnny,

01:07.959 --> 01:09.486
he left when he did, huh?

01:10.336 --> 01:12.416
What's on your mind?

01:12.536 --> 01:13.927
I want out!

<i>Sally over phone:
I think you're lying to me.</i>

03:17.584 --> 03:19.456
<i>Nucky: That's a hell
of a thing to say.</i>

03:19.489 --> 03:21.592
<i>Sally:
Prove you're not.</i>

03:21.625 --> 03:23.192
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

03:23.225 --> 03:25.561
<i>Nucky: Me llamo Enoch.</i>

03:25.594 --> 03:28.067
De los Estados Unidos

03:28.100 --> 03:31.776
soy hombre de negocios cansado.

03:31.809 --> 03:34.174
<i>You're a tired businessman?</i>

03:34.207 --> 03:36.711
<i>Nucky: Is that what I said?
I meant retired.</i>

03:36.744 --> 03:40.216
Sally: Otra almohada debajo
de los tobillos, cariño.

03:40.249 --> 03:42.384
<i>- Y apurate.
- Nucky: I give up.</i>

03:42.416 --> 03:44.455
<i>Sally: Another pillow
under my ankles, honey.</i>

03:44.488 --> 03:45.916
<i>And make it quick.</i>

03:45.957 --> 03:48.523
I think I'll let you
do the talking down there.

03:48.556 --> 03:50.658
What do you plan to do all day?

03:50.691 --> 03:53.824
<i>After today
I'm not making plans.</i>

03:53.857 --> 03:55.625
What's your plan today?

03:55.659 --> 03:57.827
The last business I need to do.

03:57.868 --> 03:59.763
<i>You know,
sitting around quietly</i>

03:59.796 --> 04:01.834
<i>isn't all
it's cracked up to be.</i>

04:01.867 --> 04:03.497
Nuck.

04:03.538 --> 04:06.800
<i>- What?
- Sally: I said, sitting by yourself-</i>

04:06.842 --> 04:09.536
<i>- I'm on the phone, God damn it.
- So am I, Sparky.</i>

04:09.577 --> 04:12.511
I'm sorry, it's just that...

04:17.046 --> 04:19.844
Sally:
Hola, Señor Negocios.

04:21.777 --> 04:23.680
<i>Look, I like
a man of few words, but-</i>

04:23.713 --> 04:26.448
Let me call you back.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.351
Facedown on the floor.

04:36.827 --> 04:40.332
Chalky, I- I looked
all over for you.

04:40.365 --> 04:42.666
You find me.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.968
- Whatever you think-
- Here it come now.

04:45.001 --> 04:47.936
- I had nothing-
- Who sitting in my club?

04:49.369 --> 04:52.777
- You have to understand-
- Answer the question.

04:52.810 --> 04:55.678
Narcisse.

04:55.711 --> 04:58.909
And who you cutting deals with?

05:00.117 --> 05:01.979
<i>Say it.</i>

05:02.012 --> 05:03.482
Narcisse.

05:03.515 --> 05:05.577
Mm, mm, mm.

05:06.753 --> 05:09.816
So he your nigger now,
that right?

05:09.849 --> 05:11.689
Not right.

05:11.722 --> 05:14.458
So you his nigger.

05:14.491 --> 05:16.659
I think I like that better.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.464
It's not what you think. I tried to stop it.
I didn't know-

05:19.497 --> 05:22.494
What I don't want
to hear from you-

05:22.527 --> 05:24.231
words.

05:24.264 --> 05:27.369
Outside my house last night,

05:27.402 --> 05:31.943
family inside
and I can't even go in.

05:32.008 --> 05:35.478
Wearing another man's clothes.

05:36.809 --> 05:40.851
Standing here with my friend.

05:40.884 --> 05:44.186
You have to trust me.
I promise-

05:44.219 --> 05:46.722
I don't have to do
nothing you ask,

05:46.755 --> 05:50.099
nohow, nowhere.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.627
Then what is it you want?

05:53.732 --> 05:56.330
Narcisse.

05:56.371 --> 06:00.000
You've got
to believe me, Chalky.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.607
We want the same thing.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.774
Oh, I know you want it now.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.881
Your regular team plus
eight additional agents?

06:10.946 --> 06:14.323
- These men are dangerous.
- How many are there?

06:14.356 --> 06:16.188
Four, counting Thompson.

06:16.221 --> 06:19.488
Each with an armed guard,
most likely more than one.

06:20.521 --> 06:23.097
You've actually
pulled this off?

06:23.130 --> 06:25.098
You seem surprised, Edgar.

06:25.131 --> 06:27.868
Organized crime?

06:27.901 --> 06:31.570
I'm merely exhibiting
a healthy skepticism.

06:31.603 --> 06:33.703
Is that what it is?

06:33.736 --> 06:35.367
What are you implying?

06:35.408 --> 06:37.906
That ever since the first
week of law school,

06:37.946 --> 06:40.516
you've been rooting
for me to fail.

06:40.549 --> 06:42.547
Sir.

06:42.580 --> 06:45.017
The US Attorney has arrived.

06:47.154 --> 06:49.218
Marcus Garvey.

06:49.263 --> 06:52.255
They're ruling on
his appeal within the month.

06:54.255 --> 06:55.695
Congratulations, Edgar.

06:55.728 --> 06:58.559
Well, we're not popping
the corks just yet.

06:58.592 --> 07:01.233
Eight additional agents.

07:01.266 --> 07:03.936
<i>Say, Jim.</i>

07:03.969 --> 07:06.471
I think it's time,

07:06.504 --> 07:09.874
considering the respect
the position deserves,

07:09.907 --> 07:13.380
you begin referring to me
as Director Hoover.

07:15.684 --> 07:19.049
Prosecutor: And when you
heard these cries for help,

07:19.082 --> 07:21.290
what did you do?

07:21.323 --> 07:23.827
Richard:
I went down-

07:23.860 --> 07:26.722
I'm sorry, sir,
I do need you to speak up.

07:27.857 --> 07:30.957
I went down the hall

07:30.990 --> 07:33.230
into the bathroom.

07:33.263 --> 07:36.503
And at what time
did you form the opinion

07:36.536 --> 07:40.404
that the body was not
that of James Darmody?

07:40.437 --> 07:42.128
Not an opinion.

07:42.169 --> 07:43.864
<i>Prosecutor:
I beg your pardon?</i>

07:43.905 --> 07:46.537
<i>Richard:
It was not an opinion.</i>

07:46.570 --> 07:49.442
I fought beside him.

07:49.475 --> 07:51.676
You don't forget that.

07:51.717 --> 07:53.842
<i>Ever.</i>

07:53.883 --> 07:57.183
Thank you, Mr. Harrow.
No further questions.

07:59.785 --> 08:01.552
I, uh...

08:01.585 --> 08:03.015
begging the pardon
of the court,

08:03.055 --> 08:06.786
I only received the particulars
of this case last-

08:06.819 --> 08:09.689
I notice you're
wearing glasses,

08:09.722 --> 08:12.488
Mr. Harold-
Harrow.

08:12.522 --> 08:14.760
<i>Are they for cosmetic purposes?</i>

08:14.794 --> 08:16.256
What?

08:16.289 --> 08:18.660
Are they for reasons of vanity

08:18.693 --> 08:20.725
or do you need them to see?

08:22.566 --> 08:24.997
They keep...

08:25.030 --> 08:27.311
Your Honor, what's the point
of a hearing if the witness-

08:27.334 --> 08:31.296
Sir, I remind you to speak
as loudly as you're able.

08:35.871 --> 08:38.405
They keep my face on.

08:41.676 --> 08:43.171
Yes, all right.

08:43.203 --> 08:45.276
So are we to believe

08:45.309 --> 08:47.876
that the vision
of your remaining eye...

08:47.917 --> 08:49.348
Badgering, Your Honor.

08:49.381 --> 08:52.016
...is more reliable than that
of Mr. Darmody's own mother?

08:52.049 --> 08:54.345
I know what happened.

08:54.386 --> 08:56.649
<i>I know what I saw.</i>

08:56.682 --> 08:58.248
I know.

08:58.289 --> 09:01.622
Your Honor, a duly certified
death record has already-

09:01.655 --> 09:03.391
A jerry-rigged death
record, Your Honor.

09:03.424 --> 09:05.826
Drake: And surely my
client's veracity

09:05.859 --> 09:08.164
- as to the identity of her own child...
- There's no body.

09:08.197 --> 09:09.963
- The exact point that we're debating.
- ... should carry more weight...

09:10.004 --> 09:12.601
- There's no body. - ... than the grief
of this aggrieved- bereaved-

09:12.633 --> 09:15.470
- We have a confession.
- There's no body.

09:15.503 --> 09:19.376
- I have to insist for your own defense, please-
- There's no body.

09:19.409 --> 09:23.115
<i>Judge: Mr. Drake, keep your client
in check or I'll have her removed.</i>

09:23.148 --> 09:26.311
It was my son. It doesn't
matter what I said.

09:26.344 --> 09:27.982
There's no one there.

09:31.953 --> 09:34.793
I was in love.
I was tricked.

09:34.826 --> 09:37.287
How can that be right?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.621
<i>Reporter: Hello. Excuse me!</i>

09:39.662 --> 09:43.094
<i>Gillian: I'm not allowed to speak.
I'm not allowed to live.</i>

09:44.128 --> 09:45.031
<i>Reporter #2:
Get on the wire.</i>

09:45.063 --> 09:47.102
Why does a man get to do
anything he wants?

09:47.135 --> 09:48.996
<i>Man: That a girl!</i>

09:49.036 --> 09:51.329
<i>Man #2: She's off! Where's the body?</i>

09:58.442 --> 10:00.178
<i>Knox: The idea is to
get them talking-</i>

10:00.211 --> 10:02.442
<i>alcohol importation,
heroin, what have you.</i>

10:02.475 --> 10:04.849
<i>Selby: Maybe they're planning
something, a heist perhaps.</i>

10:04.882 --> 10:06.914
<i>Knox: Conspiring
with one another.</i>

10:08.186 --> 10:10.217
<i>We're over here, Eli.</i>

10:13.518 --> 10:15.549
Agent Selby and our
other operatives

10:15.590 --> 10:17.686
will be stationed in
the next room listening in.

10:17.727 --> 10:20.391
When you hear the radio go
on, that's your signal.

10:20.424 --> 10:22.527
My signal for what?

10:22.560 --> 10:25.563
To excuse yourself,
go to the washroom.

10:25.595 --> 10:27.258
Things could get
a little messy.

10:27.299 --> 10:29.835
<i>Knox: All you have to
do is remain calm.</i>

10:29.868 --> 10:33.172
Neither Nucky nor the others will
ever know you were involved.

10:34.373 --> 10:37.440
You have a brother, Knox?

10:37.473 --> 10:39.134
Or whatever the fuck
your name is.

10:39.167 --> 10:41.406
- A family?
- That's none of your business.

10:41.439 --> 10:43.743
Fuck you.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.077
And you, too,
you smug son of a bitch.

10:47.979 --> 10:50.513
I have a brother named Claude.

10:50.546 --> 10:52.914
He's an admiralty lawyer
in Washington.

10:52.947 --> 10:56.084
<i>- You ever fuck Claude over?
- He's not a criminal, Eli.</i>

10:56.117 --> 10:58.554
And you're doing this
for your son.

11:02.381 --> 11:03.948
I need a guarantee.

11:03.989 --> 11:06.850
- There are no guaran-
- I'm not talking to you.

11:08.619 --> 11:11.193
We pull this off,
my son stays out of it.

11:11.226 --> 11:13.624
All that other shit,
this malarkey with him

11:13.657 --> 11:15.328
and the roommate,
that all goes away.

11:15.361 --> 11:16.929
We both have
a lot riding on-

11:16.962 --> 11:19.201
I don't even think
it's true, by the way.

11:22.369 --> 11:23.965
Get them in this room,

11:23.998 --> 11:26.405
your brother, Masseria
and the others,

11:26.438 --> 11:28.838
and Will has nothing
to worry about.

11:30.376 --> 11:32.006
Will?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.844
Do me a favor.

11:36.948 --> 11:39.275
Stop talking like you know him.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.347
<i>Al: I mean, the balls, right?</i>

11:44.387 --> 11:47.551
Took them all the way to Cicero,
building right across the street.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.612
They had to know
you were here, Al.

11:49.653 --> 11:50.747
In advance.

11:50.780 --> 11:51.916
The phone call.

11:51.949 --> 11:53.790
Now, how did he get
the number anyway?

11:53.823 --> 11:56.024
That Jew prick Hymie Weiss.

11:56.057 --> 11:58.631
Actually, he's Catholic.

11:58.664 --> 12:00.599
Wojciechoski.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.095
Wo-ja-what?

12:02.128 --> 12:04.536
His name.
He changed it to Weiss.

12:07.005 --> 12:08.445
Sit down.

12:13.852 --> 12:15.582
Have a drink.

12:15.623 --> 12:18.256
I don't drink, sir.

12:18.289 --> 12:20.423
Then start.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.194
So was it Weiss that done
the shooting or not?

12:27.227 --> 12:29.260
As you said, whoever it was

12:29.301 --> 12:32.899
felt comfortable enough to
venture into your territory.

12:32.932 --> 12:35.096
<i>Torrio: What's this?</i>

12:35.137 --> 12:36.536
A board meeting?

12:36.569 --> 12:38.473
Talking about the shooting.

12:38.506 --> 12:40.674
Thank God for them shutters.

12:40.707 --> 12:42.844
So what do you think, John?

12:42.877 --> 12:46.448
Weiss with Bugs Moran
and the other one...

12:46.481 --> 12:48.143
Schemer Drucci.

12:48.176 --> 12:50.713
<i>- You think so?
- Torrio: Sure.</i>

12:50.754 --> 12:54.554
After the O'Banion thing,
who else could it be?

12:54.587 --> 12:57.225
Yeah, I'm
sure you're right.

13:06.122 --> 13:07.792
All right, Jimmy, get this
thing the fuck out of here.

13:07.825 --> 13:10.128
You're killing me.
Come on.

13:12.563 --> 13:14.772
Before you ask, it's light.

13:14.805 --> 13:16.140
I already know that.

13:16.173 --> 13:19.967
This whole situation, your
friend there, the doctor.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.269
Narcisse.

13:21.302 --> 13:23.405
It ain't making things
easier, that's for sure.

13:23.438 --> 13:26.111
Five trucks full of scotch
turned away from the Northside.

13:26.144 --> 13:28.312
I mean, he must be getting his
liquor trucked down from New York.

13:28.345 --> 13:30.812
All of which answers the question
why the envelope is short.

13:30.845 --> 13:32.410
I said I already know, Mickey.

13:32.443 --> 13:35.050
All right. I just thought you
deserved an explanation.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.019
So what's the plan?

13:37.052 --> 13:38.787
With what?

13:38.820 --> 13:40.985
This Bible-thumping coon.

13:41.018 --> 13:43.581
<i>I mean, how much more of his
bullshit are we gonna take?</i>

13:43.614 --> 13:45.947
It's being handled, Eli.

13:45.988 --> 13:49.124
- How?
- I don't know.

13:49.157 --> 13:51.291
And nothing from Chalky?

13:54.623 --> 13:58.155
The meeting.
Are we set?

13:58.188 --> 14:00.925
Tomorrow night, the Blenheim.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.524
Masseria, Lansky,
and Petrucelli.

14:03.564 --> 14:05.561
Make sure they-

14:16.339 --> 14:18.903
Mr. Thompson.

14:18.936 --> 14:21.807
I looked for you
in the Onyx Club.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.717
Not the safest place
for me these days.

14:26.717 --> 14:29.921
I need to ask you a favor.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.887
I already gave you
a job, Mr. Harrow.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.500
Give us a minute.

14:54.470 --> 14:56.845
Jimmy Darmody.

14:56.878 --> 14:58.846
What about him?

15:00.016 --> 15:03.491
I need to know where he is.

15:04.357 --> 15:06.187
He was cremated

15:06.227 --> 15:08.289
after overdosing
in his mother's tub.

15:08.322 --> 15:11.730
You and I both know
that isn't true.

15:13.195 --> 15:15.767
I only know what I
read in the papers.

15:16.967 --> 15:20.501
Then you've read
Gillian Darmody

15:20.534 --> 15:23.272
has been arrested for murder.

15:24.976 --> 15:27.141
But that's ludicrous.

15:27.174 --> 15:30.939
It was James
who died in that tub.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.645
If they believe that,

15:33.678 --> 15:36.215
she'll go free.

15:36.248 --> 15:40.686
And she'll come back
for the boy to spite me.

15:40.719 --> 15:42.454
After all of this,

15:42.487 --> 15:44.895
my wife and I...

15:46.193 --> 15:48.199
could not bear that.

15:53.833 --> 15:57.274
If somehow an anonymous source

15:57.308 --> 15:59.410
were to disclose
to the authorities

15:59.443 --> 16:01.777
the whereabouts
of Jimmy's body...

16:01.810 --> 16:05.711
what would you do
for that anonymous source?

16:10.055 --> 16:14.317
I would do whatever you asked.

16:23.170 --> 16:26.305
- Nice and orderly, guys.
- All right, all right.

16:26.338 --> 16:28.168
Let the doctor through.

16:29.369 --> 16:31.779
Stand back, boys.
A little dignity.

16:31.812 --> 16:33.252
- Get a picture.
- Come on, get back.

16:33.276 --> 16:36.218
- Hey, don't push.
- Is it Darmody?

16:36.251 --> 16:38.147
Six screws in the right femur.

16:38.188 --> 16:40.555
- It's him. It's Darmody.
- Fellas, please, stand back.

16:40.587 --> 16:42.722
If that's Darmody,
then who's the other one?

16:42.755 --> 16:45.856
Hey, get it back!

16:45.889 --> 16:47.559
Take it easy!

16:47.591 --> 16:49.325
Call it in
for the afternoon edition.

16:59.995 --> 17:03.462
Well, guess I'll
kick things off and-

17:03.495 --> 17:05.301
- Ed.
- Yeah, Nuck?

17:05.335 --> 17:07.671
Get the fuck out of here.

17:07.704 --> 17:09.303
It's my office.

17:09.336 --> 17:11.636
I'll change that if it's
the last thing I do.

17:11.669 --> 17:14.002
I just did what I had to.

17:14.035 --> 17:15.674
You of all people-

17:15.707 --> 17:18.444
It would be best
to leave us be.

17:33.885 --> 17:36.019
- You've seen him.
- I didn't say that.

17:36.052 --> 17:38.354
You've heard from him.

17:38.387 --> 17:40.090
Either you have
or you have not.

17:40.123 --> 17:41.458
If you have not,
then my time-

17:41.491 --> 17:43.362
He wants this to end.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.395
Endings have been
attempted, have they not?

17:46.428 --> 17:49.067
- On all sides.
- This is a question of family.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.402
His daughter's getting married.
He wants to be there.

17:51.436 --> 17:54.369
He's looking for safe
passage in and out.

17:54.402 --> 17:56.537
In exchange for what?

17:56.570 --> 17:58.305
I'm just the middleman here.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.736
I thought you were friends.

17:59.777 --> 18:02.679
I don't have friends.
I have partners.

18:02.712 --> 18:04.207
You tried to save his life.

18:04.247 --> 18:08.111
I bet on a horse to win.
He didn't even place.

18:08.152 --> 18:10.247
Today is a different day.

18:10.287 --> 18:12.919
On whom will you
wager tomorrow?

18:14.458 --> 18:17.058
Let's get something
straight, all right?

18:17.091 --> 18:20.498
Your beliefs,
your tragic history,

18:20.531 --> 18:22.528
I don't give a rat's ass
about any of it.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.102
<i>The only thing your people
and mine have in common-</i>

18:26.135 --> 18:28.231
<i>we both know
what a dollar's worth.</i>

18:28.271 --> 18:31.535
And if we can't make it one
way, we'll make it another.

18:33.041 --> 18:36.377
I have a lot at stake
in this town.

18:36.410 --> 18:39.175
Try to take it from me,
we have a problem.

18:39.216 --> 18:41.015
<i>The club, the Northside,</i>

18:41.048 --> 18:43.815
<i>I don't care which of you
coloreds runs them,</i>

18:43.848 --> 18:45.415
<i>as long as they're run.</i>

18:45.456 --> 18:48.857
The percentage,
your new pal the mayor,

18:48.890 --> 18:50.394
we'll discuss those later.

18:50.427 --> 18:53.097
<i>This just needs to be over.</i>

18:53.130 --> 18:55.063
Over how?

18:55.096 --> 18:56.965
<i>That's for you to arrange.</i>

18:56.998 --> 18:59.299
I urge you to be explicit.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.065
I don't ever want to
worry about that spook

19:02.098 --> 19:04.696
coming at me in the dark again.

19:09.734 --> 19:12.173
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

19:12.206 --> 19:14.406
We do.

19:14.439 --> 19:16.837
At long last.

19:18.845 --> 19:22.147
Then I'll let Chalky know
you're willing to talk.

19:31.555 --> 19:34.016
Something he wanted
me to tell you.

19:34.057 --> 19:36.023
Said you'd be interested.

19:36.056 --> 19:38.023
Yes?

19:38.056 --> 19:39.589
<i>That singer.</i>

19:39.622 --> 19:42.293
<i>He says he knows where she is.</i>

19:54.861 --> 19:56.998
And be sure to pick up
the artichokes.

19:57.031 --> 19:58.599
They're 22 cents a pound.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.671
<i>- So? Aspetta.
- I'm not paying that.</i>

20:01.704 --> 20:04.835
What, are we paupers? I want
artichokes, for God's sake.

20:04.876 --> 20:07.443
<i>Maladetta funga.</i>

20:07.476 --> 20:09.949
I just sprayed all this.

20:41.261 --> 20:43.904
Go ahead.
Speak in a normal tone.

20:43.937 --> 20:46.936
Test, test.
Alpha, beta, gamma.

20:46.969 --> 20:48.303
Test, test.

20:48.336 --> 20:52.238
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

20:52.271 --> 20:54.375
Test, test.
One, two.

20:54.408 --> 20:56.783
<i>One, two, three, four, five.</i>

20:56.816 --> 20:59.447
<i>Panama.
Test, test.</i>

20:59.480 --> 21:02.255
<i>On the shores of Gitche
Gumee, on the shining...</i>

21:02.288 --> 21:04.991
I want four agents in the lobby,
two at either end of the hall.

21:05.024 --> 21:06.655
That seems excessive.

21:06.688 --> 21:09.957
I didn't ask how it seems.

21:09.990 --> 21:11.955
Check those magazines,
gentlemen.

21:11.988 --> 21:13.793
We can't afford any misfires.

21:13.826 --> 21:15.455
Well?

21:16.591 --> 21:18.757
- Sir?
- Can you hear him or not?

21:18.790 --> 21:21.355
- For the most part.
- What does that mean?

21:21.396 --> 21:24.089
- I can make out most-
- Yes or no?

21:24.130 --> 21:27.434
Relax, Jim.
It'll be all right.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.269
This is only my career, Harold.

21:31.302 --> 21:33.403
I'll relax when it's over.

21:38.473 --> 21:40.345
<i>Sid:
Right.</i>

21:40.378 --> 21:42.482
<i>Yes.</i>

21:42.515 --> 21:44.712
<i>Mr. White
will be there.</i>

21:46.415 --> 21:49.518
Narcisse's man, he'll
be at the club by 9:00.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.165
<i>Brian: Vroom vroom! Beep beep!</i>

22:15.666 --> 22:17.266
<i>Patrick:
Pop.</i>

22:17.299 --> 22:19.699
Pop, it's Uncle Nucky.

22:22.802 --> 22:24.968
Cut the racket, huh?

22:33.875 --> 22:35.305
Hello?

22:35.346 --> 22:37.712
<i>Nucky: The meeting, I
want you to pick me up.</i>

22:37.745 --> 22:39.849
<i>We'll drive over together.</i>

22:40.882 --> 22:42.945
Easier just to meet there, no?

22:42.986 --> 22:46.487
We should walk in together,
present a united front.

22:50.149 --> 22:52.085
I'm on your way anyway.

22:52.118 --> 22:54.727
Sure thing.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.064
I'll see you in a little while.

22:58.896 --> 23:00.803
That Uncle Nucky?

23:01.830 --> 23:04.198
What? Yeah.

23:04.239 --> 23:07.012
- What'd he want?
- What'd he want?

23:07.039 --> 23:09.006
How's that your concern?

23:09.039 --> 23:11.172
It's not.
I just-

23:11.205 --> 23:13.571
I'm curious, that's all.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.611
Tell your mother I'll be late.

23:32.924 --> 23:36.922
<i>Announcer: All aboard the
Camden Line for Philadelphia.</i>

23:36.955 --> 23:39.793
<i>Connecting with
the North Shore Line...</i>

23:39.826 --> 23:43.862
Two sleepers with extra
vouchers for the dining car.

23:43.895 --> 23:45.860
Tommy and I can double up.

23:45.893 --> 23:48.029
Your brother-in-law,
this Hubert,

23:48.062 --> 23:49.566
he got the message?

23:49.599 --> 23:52.799
He'll be there
90 minutes early.

23:54.407 --> 23:58.934
Hey, make sure you count
how many cows you see.

23:58.967 --> 24:01.638
- I want a full report.
- Okay.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.912
Tommy.

24:10.141 --> 24:12.013
I love you.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.727
Come on, sport. Let's get
some Chuckles for the road.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.962
What was that?
Good-bye?

24:29.995 --> 24:33.030
- No.
- Promise me you're coming.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.068
Because I've never even
spoken to your sister

24:35.102 --> 24:38.403
and it will be pretty goddamn
awkward if you don't show-

24:47.113 --> 24:49.878
I will see you in three days.

24:49.911 --> 24:53.010
Or I will hunt you down
and drag you to Wisconsin.

24:54.107 --> 24:55.641
I promise.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.363
Hello?

25:59.701 --> 26:01.940
Nuck?

26:15.962 --> 26:18.789
Put that away
before someone gets hurt.

26:18.822 --> 26:22.397
The fuck's going on?
Where is everyone?

26:22.430 --> 26:25.865
- Closing the place up.
- What for?

26:25.906 --> 26:29.137
Would you put
that away, please?

26:35.976 --> 26:38.015
I'm leaving town.

26:38.048 --> 26:40.512
Heading to Cuba with Sally.

26:40.553 --> 26:42.246
When?

26:42.287 --> 26:44.381
As soon as I finish
what I need to do.

26:44.414 --> 26:46.789
When were you gonna tell me?

26:46.822 --> 26:49.156
I intended to tell you now.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.189
We have a meeting.

26:53.230 --> 26:55.658
- Masseria is-
- There is no meeting.

26:55.691 --> 26:57.962
I saw to that.

26:57.995 --> 27:01.298
There are names on a hotel
register with three empty rooms.

27:01.331 --> 27:03.634
And you and me.

27:23.649 --> 27:26.951
<i>- Nucky, I-
- Nucky, I what?</i>

27:26.992 --> 27:29.654
Nucky, I made a mistake?

27:30.823 --> 27:33.190
Nucky, I'm sorry?

27:39.065 --> 27:41.601
What's it matter what I say?

27:41.642 --> 27:43.674
You have a lot to lose.

27:43.707 --> 27:46.713
Me?
I don't have anything.

27:48.210 --> 27:51.049
Sooner or later
you wind up taking it all.

27:51.082 --> 27:54.218
Can't help it.

28:02.426 --> 28:04.422
I'm ready.

28:04.455 --> 28:06.355
Are you?

28:27.077 --> 28:30.649
It's what you deserve.

28:34.649 --> 28:36.585
- Pop!
- Back off!

28:36.618 --> 28:38.554
- That's my son!
- What are you doing?

28:38.587 --> 28:41.258
- Hey!
- He's gonna kill you.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.592
No, he's not.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.128
He's- he's not.

28:46.161 --> 28:48.129
Nah.

28:50.669 --> 28:52.340
You tell him.

28:53.635 --> 28:55.844
Tell him what's going on.

28:57.408 --> 28:59.546
Knox.

28:59.580 --> 29:02.580
You had it right.
He's no Prohee.

29:02.613 --> 29:05.283
The kid at school,
that murder charge

29:05.316 --> 29:08.280
you had the DA squash,
he knows.

29:08.323 --> 29:10.886
He knows.

29:10.919 --> 29:15.390
He wants you and New
York and Florida

29:15.423 --> 29:17.854
all together all at once.

29:19.463 --> 29:21.862
That's the price

29:21.895 --> 29:23.534
to keep him out of jail.

29:23.567 --> 29:25.966
- Pop, I-
- So you go to him?

29:25.999 --> 29:27.902
Over your father?

29:27.935 --> 29:29.903
I'm the one who can fix it.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.942
He was supposed
to amount to something.

29:31.975 --> 29:33.742
He's still going to.

29:33.775 --> 29:38.585
What? A man
in an empty hotel

29:38.618 --> 29:41.352
pointing a gun at his brother?

29:41.385 --> 29:42.584
I did it for the family.

29:42.617 --> 29:45.090
You don't have a family.

29:45.123 --> 29:47.092
I do.

29:47.125 --> 29:49.827
Now you want that, too.

29:51.595 --> 29:55.497
Nothing will fill
that hole you got inside.

29:56.971 --> 29:59.108
Don't you know that yet?

30:04.508 --> 30:07.516
This is your mess, Eli.

30:07.549 --> 30:09.411
Drown in it.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
They're not coming.

30:29.833 --> 30:32.001
You don't know that.

30:33.906 --> 30:37.303
You've been duped, Jim.
Let's face it.

30:39.310 --> 30:42.047
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.651
- What?
- That would make your entire day.

30:45.789 --> 30:47.483
Give us a minute, will you?

30:58.704 --> 31:01.070
You're upset.
I understand.

31:01.103 --> 31:03.268
Upset?

31:03.301 --> 31:05.573
- Upset?!
- Just calm down.

31:05.605 --> 31:08.078
You think I don't know?
You, Hoover and the others,

31:08.111 --> 31:10.151
- what a joke this has all been?
- Jim, I-

31:10.184 --> 31:12.014
You were never on board,
never for a second.

31:12.047 --> 31:14.182
I have put everything
on the line!

31:18.119 --> 31:21.256
I think you should
give me your sidearm.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.695
What?

31:22.728 --> 31:25.293
You are not keeping
on an even keel.

31:29.702 --> 31:31.600
You want my gun, Harold?

31:33.978 --> 31:35.607
Why don't you take it?

32:21.454 --> 32:24.116
He's asking for you.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.800
You awake?

32:49.312 --> 32:50.784
How you feeling?

32:50.817 --> 32:53.153
I'm okay.

32:56.356 --> 32:58.491
I've never heard you
say that before.

32:58.531 --> 33:00.594
Morphine.

33:01.628 --> 33:03.004
Well, relax and enjoy it.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.605
We got round-the-clock
guards, nurses, too.

33:10.646 --> 33:12.613
You'll be out of here
in no time.

33:12.647 --> 33:15.478
And then we'll get
them sons of bitches.

33:24.126 --> 33:29.201
This is a young man's game.

33:29.234 --> 33:33.165
I'm not gonna fight.

33:33.198 --> 33:35.162
You're gonna let them
get away with it?

33:35.195 --> 33:38.574
It's yours, Al.

33:39.839 --> 33:42.607
- Take it.
- What? Take what?

33:42.648 --> 33:45.309
The whole operation.

33:45.382 --> 33:48.213
Jesus, Johnny.
Are you sure?

33:48.246 --> 33:50.415
You win, kid.

33:50.456 --> 33:53.394
I'm out of your way.

33:54.692 --> 33:56.962
It's Europe for me.

34:10.704 --> 34:12.944
- What is going on?
- Where's Will?

34:12.976 --> 34:14.543
- Eli...
- Is he here or not?

34:14.577 --> 34:16.007
You need to be honest with me.

34:16.049 --> 34:19.880
Eli. Did you forget
we had an appointment?

34:21.719 --> 34:24.120
No.

34:24.152 --> 34:26.058
Give me a second.

34:26.091 --> 34:28.259
- I need to speak with this man.
- He does, ma'am.

34:28.292 --> 34:29.960
- Please, I need-
- Where is Willie?

34:29.994 --> 34:32.094
That's an excellent
question, actually.

34:32.128 --> 34:34.496
- Mom, Anne is crying.
- Just one second.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.098
- Go back upstairs.
- Eli.

34:36.130 --> 34:37.668
Will someone please tell me
what is going on?

34:37.708 --> 34:40.603
Now, God damn it.
Go upstairs.

34:56.152 --> 34:58.920
Look, my brother knows-

34:58.953 --> 35:00.433
What did I tell you
would happen, Eli?

35:00.458 --> 35:02.291
- Will you just hear me out?
- I'm through talking.

35:02.332 --> 35:06.300
- I'm trying to explain to you.
- Your son is going to jail.

35:09.435 --> 35:11.403
There was this boy
a while back.

35:11.436 --> 35:13.035
Ellis something.

35:13.076 --> 35:14.809
About your own son's age.

35:14.842 --> 35:16.536
A real Boy Scout type.

35:16.576 --> 35:19.406
I arrested him
on a stolen vehicles charge.

35:19.439 --> 35:22.047
He got four years
in the federal lockup.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.577
Last I heard,

35:23.617 --> 35:25.882
he was very popular
with the other inmates.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.583
I will fucking kill you,
you son of a-

35:28.616 --> 35:31.787
Are you threatening
a federal agent?

35:35.560 --> 35:37.696
Give me your wrist.

35:45.763 --> 35:49.703
My partner, Agent Selby,
he thinks I'm crazy.

35:51.777 --> 35:54.710
Do you think I'm crazy, Eli?

35:54.743 --> 35:56.910
It's okay, you can say it.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.753
I don't know what you are.

36:00.786 --> 36:03.058
I'll tell you what I am.

36:03.091 --> 36:04.994
I'm the man
who's gonna-

36:05.027 --> 36:07.257
Fucking kill you!

36:41.622 --> 36:44.228
<i>Anne: Mama!</i>

36:44.261 --> 36:46.766
Eli! Eli!

36:46.799 --> 36:47.895
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

36:57.711 --> 36:59.976
<i>June: Stay up there!
I'm coming up.</i>

37:00.009 --> 37:01.913
<i>Edith:
Dad! Dad!</i>

37:01.946 --> 37:03.680
<i>Girls:
Dad! Daddy!</i>

37:06.351 --> 37:07.815
My son!

37:07.855 --> 37:09.823
My fucking son!

38:08.465 --> 38:11.435
<i>Girl: Daddy!</i>

38:13.842 --> 38:18.271
<i>Girls:
Daddy! Daddy!</i>

38:49.776 --> 38:51.808
What you want us to do?

38:53.378 --> 38:56.317
Stay right here
and don't raise no fuss.

38:56.350 --> 38:57.852
Don't like it.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.586
Ain't meant to be liked.

39:14.442 --> 39:16.239
Tell me your terms.

39:17.943 --> 39:19.844
You get everything.

39:19.877 --> 39:22.410
<i>- I already have that.
- Then why we talking?</i>

39:22.443 --> 39:24.809
I want and you want.

39:26.083 --> 39:28.517
<i>Emcee:
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

39:28.551 --> 39:30.549
<i>Egypt had its pharaohs</i>

39:30.590 --> 39:32.523
<i>and the emperors ruled
from Rome...</i>

39:32.556 --> 39:33.922
Where is she?

39:33.955 --> 39:36.551
Where she is and you ain't.

39:37.721 --> 39:39.889
Your daughter's wedding.
Safe passage.

39:39.922 --> 39:41.929
That right.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.863
- Then what?
- Matter to you so long as I'm gone?

39:44.896 --> 39:48.397
A daughter for a daughter.

39:48.430 --> 39:51.568
That woman ain't your blood.

39:51.601 --> 39:54.408
How could you
possibly understand?

39:54.441 --> 39:57.943
I understand I rock her fine.

39:58.943 --> 40:01.813
That was some sweet jelly.

40:01.846 --> 40:03.278
Hmm.

40:03.311 --> 40:05.480
Now her face ain't right

40:05.521 --> 40:08.256
and I don't need to be
looking at that no more.

40:08.289 --> 40:11.791
Behold the noble savage.

40:11.824 --> 40:13.525
That me.

40:13.558 --> 40:17.193
Bankroll in the one pocket,
pistol in the other.

40:18.297 --> 40:20.566
And all the rest...

40:22.030 --> 40:24.796
I never did give a fuck.

40:24.829 --> 40:27.302
We see each other now?

40:29.705 --> 40:33.110
You know what your friend
Mr. Thompson asked me to do?

40:36.044 --> 40:38.876
Kick a bullet in my head.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.583
But that ain't
gonna happen here.

40:42.624 --> 40:44.223
We civilized.

40:46.327 --> 40:48.358
None of you will
make it past the alley.

40:50.756 --> 40:53.562
Then you ain't never
gonna see her again.

40:53.595 --> 40:57.760
Baby you save from that half
and half choke her mama.

40:57.793 --> 40:59.727
They ever catch that man?

40:59.761 --> 41:01.367
Tell me where she is.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.135
My girl wedding.

41:03.168 --> 41:05.704
There is no wedding.

41:05.737 --> 41:07.440
What you know about it?

41:07.473 --> 41:10.039
I know what Maybelle told me.

41:10.072 --> 41:14.879
But hear it from her yourself.

41:20.654 --> 41:23.659
A nod from me and she's gone.

41:23.692 --> 41:26.857
I'd say that makes us even.

42:55.013 --> 42:56.814
<i>- Man: Let's go, Timmy!

42:56.847 --> 42:58.919
- We got to go.
- I ain't leaving her.

42:58.952 --> 43:00.518
We got to leave here now.
Come on, let's go!

43:00.550 --> 43:03.882

43:03.947 --> 43:05.922
Nobody move.
Bureau of Investigation.

43:05.955 --> 43:08.356
We're looking for Eli Thompson.

43:08.389 --> 43:11.659
Go, go, go.

43:11.692 --> 43:13.394
<i>Go!</i>

43:13.427 --> 43:15.496
<i>There on the right.</i>

43:15.529 --> 43:18.702
<i>Go. Go on, go.</i>

43:18.735 --> 43:23.341
<i>- Woman: Stop! Now what?
- Woman #2: I don't know! I don't know where to go.</i>

43:29.409 --> 43:32.746
- What are we supposed to do?
- Everybody's gone and run out the front door.

43:32.779 --> 43:34.499
- Out of the way, folks.
- Let's go, people.

43:34.515 --> 43:36.115
<i>- Move it, fellas.
- Scoot back.</i>

43:36.148 --> 43:37.419
<i>Okay, over here.</i>

43:37.452 --> 43:38.785
Excuse me.

43:51.663 --> 43:53.229
Back, back, back.

43:53.263 --> 43:54.733
- Back.
- Hey, get off.

44:06.804 --> 44:09.340
<i>Agent:
Let us through!</i>

44:09.380 --> 44:11.749
<i>Woman:
Yeah, take them away!</i>

44:56.490 --> 44:58.993
Selby:
Enoch Thompson?

44:59.026 --> 45:00.488
Yes?

45:00.528 --> 45:02.191
I need you
to come with me, sir.

45:02.224 --> 45:05.063
- Am I under arrest?
- You will be if you don't comply.

45:07.129 --> 45:08.634
What is it you want, Officer?

45:08.667 --> 45:10.677
The whereabouts
of your brother.

45:10.710 --> 45:14.043
Are you going to charge him
with cancelling a meeting?

45:14.077 --> 45:17.117
No, with the murder
of a federal agent.

45:50.013 --> 45:53.782
You entered this country through
the Port of New Orleans

45:53.815 --> 45:57.959
in 1898, is that correct?

45:57.992 --> 45:59.895
I beg your pardon?

45:59.928 --> 46:01.623
Is that correct?

46:04.803 --> 46:06.138
Who are you?

46:06.171 --> 46:08.337
The one asking questions.

46:11.001 --> 46:13.407
1898, yes.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.409
26 years
in the United States...

46:17.780 --> 46:19.817
but you're not a citizen.

46:19.850 --> 46:24.718
And that is grounds
for detaining me how?

46:24.751 --> 46:27.384
Why would you go on
living in a country

46:27.425 --> 46:29.857
you don't wish to belong to?

46:31.329 --> 46:34.127
The exile does not
choose his Babylon.

46:36.231 --> 46:41.268
Your, um, compatriot Garvey.

46:41.309 --> 46:44.169
He thinks you should
all return to Africa.

46:45.705 --> 46:48.513
That would be
an oversimplification

46:48.547 --> 46:50.347
of his philosophy.

46:50.380 --> 46:53.253
What am I missing?

46:53.286 --> 46:56.985
I doubt that I could
make you to understand.

46:58.489 --> 47:01.554
You seem to be a clever fellow.

47:03.933 --> 47:07.468
Who do you think gets to
decide what the truth is?

47:10.974 --> 47:15.645
Truth is what those
in power wish it to be.

47:17.739 --> 47:20.377
During the course
of investigating

47:20.410 --> 47:24.650
the seditious activities
of Marcus Garvey,

47:24.683 --> 47:26.819
James M. Tolliver,

47:26.852 --> 47:30.021
<i>a special agent with
the Bureau of Investigation,</i>

47:30.054 --> 47:33.155
was murdered in Atlantic
City, New Jersey,

47:33.188 --> 47:36.362
by an unidentified
colored male.

47:36.395 --> 47:40.230
<i>Dr. Valentin Narcisse
assisted the Bureau</i>

47:40.271 --> 47:43.807
in apprehending the suspect.

47:43.840 --> 47:48.176
He further agreed
in a private conversation

47:48.209 --> 47:51.019
with Director Hoover to provide

47:51.052 --> 47:55.924
<i>ongoing secret intelligence
regarding Mr. Garvey</i>

47:55.957 --> 47:59.596
with particular concern
to his radical agenda

47:59.629 --> 48:03.860
and his ties to foreign powers.

48:06.268 --> 48:08.530
Why would he do that?

48:08.571 --> 48:10.738
To demonstrate his commitment

48:10.771 --> 48:14.046
to the values
of his adopted land.

48:15.680 --> 48:19.279
Brother Garvey is a hero

48:19.320 --> 48:22.884
devoted to the liberation
of a great people.

48:22.917 --> 48:24.485
<i>But you are not.</i>

48:24.518 --> 48:28.362
You are just a peddler
and a pimp

48:28.395 --> 48:31.728
sitting in a jail cell.

48:34.129 --> 48:38.035
I am a businessman
and a follower of Christ.

48:38.075 --> 48:41.444
<i>You agree to cooperate,
you can go on pretending</i>

48:41.477 --> 48:43.642
to be anything you want.

48:45.212 --> 48:48.622
You don't, and I will make sure

48:48.655 --> 48:53.025
you never see daylight
in America again.

49:04.906 --> 49:06.935
<i>I cannot hear you.</i>

49:14.783 --> 49:18.645
I said yes.

49:18.686 --> 49:21.487
Yes, what?

49:22.791 --> 49:24.625
Yes...

49:26.964 --> 49:29.066
sir.

49:54.992 --> 49:57.024
That's everything Ma asked for.

49:57.057 --> 49:59.624
Tom can run it up
to Brigantine later.

49:59.657 --> 50:01.160
Unless you want to do it.

50:01.193 --> 50:04.465
I'm gonna stay in town
for a little.

50:04.498 --> 50:07.002
- Not trying to tell you-
- Uncle Nucky, can we just-

50:07.035 --> 50:09.442
But they're
counting on you-

50:09.475 --> 50:12.877
your mother, brothers
and sisters.

50:12.910 --> 50:15.581
You're in charge now.

50:15.614 --> 50:16.981
You understand?

50:19.519 --> 50:21.158
I'll drive up tonight.

50:21.191 --> 50:24.558
That's the right decision.

50:26.327 --> 50:28.865
What am I supposed
to tell them?

50:28.898 --> 50:32.464
That your father is safe
with friends out west.

50:32.505 --> 50:34.901
It's best
they don't know where.

50:34.934 --> 50:38.435
It's hard on everyone,
but that's how it has to be.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.509
Is he?

50:40.542 --> 50:42.278
Is he what?

50:42.311 --> 50:43.941
Safe.

50:46.109 --> 50:47.914
Speak your mind, Will.

50:50.713 --> 50:54.714
If I hadn't shown up,
what would you have done?

51:00.152 --> 51:04.451
He's your father, my brother.

51:05.959 --> 51:09.195
And I'm not the person
you think I am.

51:27.043 --> 51:29.277
Come by the Albatross later.

51:29.318 --> 51:32.087
We'll both head up.

51:32.120 --> 51:35.556
That way, all of us can
be together, all right?

51:40.154 --> 51:42.828
It gets easier.
You'll see.
