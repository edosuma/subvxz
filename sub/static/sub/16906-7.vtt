WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:05.210
- I don't want to look.
- Hey, come on. This is a win-win.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.649
If it's positive,
"Awesome! We're having a baby!

00:07.741 --> 00:08.776
I wanna name it Frisbee!"

00:09.075 --> 00:10.611
If it's negative, "Awesome.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.348
We're not gonna fight
about the name Frisbee,

00:12.445 --> 00:15.722
and we get disco fries
for breakfast 'cause we're sad."

00:20.120 --> 00:21.258
I bet it's me.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.028
All those years trying to get on
"America's Funniest Home Videos".

00:24.157 --> 00:25.158
Aah!

00:25.558 --> 00:26.366
Aah!

00:26.459 --> 00:27.460
Oh!

00:28.695 --> 00:30.197
Aah!

00:30.296 --> 00:33.175
It's just not fair.
I mean, that guy gets a baby?

00:33.266 --> 00:36.042
What kind of idiot gives
the little kid orange soda?

00:36.603 --> 00:39.345
- Hey, dummies.
- Hey, Dennis!

00:39.439 --> 00:40.611
- Hey, buddy!
- How you doin'?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.380
Why do you have a baby?
Is this a scam?

00:42.475 --> 00:43.385
I don't need any scams.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.478
I've got a brand-new business
selling suicide insurance,

00:45.578 --> 00:46.579
and it's going great.

00:46.679 --> 00:49.182
And this baby -- This is my adopted son.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.818
Obviously, he's gonna be an athlete,

00:51.117 --> 00:53.597
so I only got to save up
for, like, one year of college.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.098
Wait. They let you adopt a baby?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.759
If by "they" you mean those guys,
or whatever,

00:59.059 --> 01:01.471
yeah, they let me
and my wife adopt a baby.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.768
You remember Megan Duffy,
maiden name Duffy.

01:04.063 --> 01:04.769
Hopefully no relation.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.238
I recognize you two.
Did we have a four-way?

01:07.333 --> 01:08.778
No, St. Patty's Day.
Remember, honey?

01:09.069 --> 01:09.774
What? It is?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.175
Ha-ha!

01:13.606 --> 01:16.553
We decided to adopt 'cause Megan's
real career-oriented right now,

01:16.643 --> 01:17.849
didn't want to wreck her boobs.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.385
Couple months later, boom,
we got Black Dennis.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.222
His name is Black Dennis?
That's racist.

01:23.316 --> 01:26.456
Yeah, right, Liz,
the guy with the black son is racist.

01:27.687 --> 01:28.825
Later days, dummies.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.625
21st-century family coming through!
This is the new normal!

7x07 - Mazel Tov, Dummies!
Original Air Date on November 29, 2012

01:51.277 --> 01:53.450
Tray, have you read
any of these movie scripts yet?

01:53.546 --> 01:56.220
Yeah. I read the one
about a handsome genius

01:56.316 --> 01:58.489
who lied to two idiots
about reading scripts.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.225
You've got to choose the next project
for your company.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.301
Dammit-I'll-Pick-A-Name-Later
Dotcom Productions.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.493
You have pitch meetings all morning.

02:04.591 --> 02:07.197
Okay, it's almost 11:00.
Please send in my 8:00.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.794
While on holiday in Tuscany,

02:08.895 --> 02:12.843
a middle-aged divorcÃ©e falls in love
with a lazy pervert who's into hats.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.669
In a world with too much freedom,

02:14.767 --> 02:16.872
one young man dared to be different.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.583
"Hitler: The Boy Who Dreamed of Stars"!

02:20.673 --> 02:23.279
It's a Harriet Tubman biopic entitled,

02:23.376 --> 02:24.855
"The Moses of Maryland".

02:25.145 --> 02:26.749
I'll buy it!

02:26.846 --> 02:28.621
Sorry, I was talking on my Bluetooth

02:28.715 --> 02:30.319
to a guy at the octopus auction.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.724
I hate your idea.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.161
Tracy, NBC Universal

02:33.253 --> 02:34.664
has acquired the film rights

02:34.754 --> 02:36.256
to the YouTube clip,

02:36.356 --> 02:38.393
"Man Loses Pants on Trampoline".

02:38.491 --> 02:41.370
How would you like to be
the voice of Gaboing,

02:41.461 --> 02:43.566
the evil wizard who would take

02:43.663 --> 02:45.700
jumping away from Jumpland?

02:45.798 --> 02:47.835
Thank you for coming in.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.437
Running a movie studio is exhausting.

02:50.637 --> 02:51.843
I need a nap.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.748
Dotcom, tell us
your most interesting story.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.751
Sorry, Tray.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.584
The next item on the agenda
is your insurance physical.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.383
Great!

02:59.479 --> 03:02.619
Worst day ever!

03:05.418 --> 03:08.592
I mean, my name has been
on adoption lists for years.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.931
But Dennis Duffy gets a baby
because he's married? It's idiotic.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.364
You know who else was married?
Ted Bundy.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.633
- I don't think so, Liz.
- Really? He's so handsome.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.572
Is he still alive?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.577
The point is, anyone can get married.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.238
What, all of a sudden,
you're a better parent

03:23.336 --> 03:24.872
because you signed a piece of paper?

03:24.971 --> 03:27.474
Yeah, we're as committed
to each other as any married couple.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.848
We live together, we love each other.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.684
I ignore it when you eat popsicles
by biting them with your teeth,

03:31.778 --> 03:32.916
which is insane!

03:33.213 --> 03:34.317
I love popsicles!

03:34.414 --> 03:36.257
We might as well be married, so...

03:36.349 --> 03:40.820
So, let's do it. Let's get married.
Like every other idiot on earth.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.594
Me need piece of
paper to know how I feel!

03:43.690 --> 03:46.500
Guhhhh, Liz marry Criss?

03:46.593 --> 03:47.264
Doy!

03:47.360 --> 03:48.668
Errr, all right.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.604
Wait, was that a "yes"?
Are we getting married?

03:50.697 --> 03:51.698
Yeah, let's do this.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.802
We'll get a license today, get married
tomorrow, blammo! Engaged!

03:56.436 --> 03:58.313
"Top Gun"-style.

03:59.672 --> 04:02.243
Jenna Maroney, you are my slave.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.879
What? But the sheik who won me
in that poker game was beheaded.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.514
No, do you remember in 1994

04:06.613 --> 04:08.854
you made a commercial for Surge Cola?

04:08.948 --> 04:10.655
For 100 Surge points, I got these shades!

04:10.750 --> 04:14.527
Oh, yeah? For 500 Surge points,
I got this leather jacket!

04:14.621 --> 04:15.497
I can beat that.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.298
For a million points, he got me!

04:18.391 --> 04:20.632
Surge! Suck it down!

04:20.726 --> 04:22.502
Oh, I remember that.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.973
My boyfriend was supposed
to pick me up after that shoot,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.609
so I called him, and I was like,
"O.J., where are you?"

04:27.700 --> 04:29.976
And he was like, "Wait, you're alive?
Then who did I kill?"

04:30.270 --> 04:32.978
For 17 years I've been buying up
old cases of Surge Cola,

04:33.273 --> 04:35.344
and I now have one million Surge points.

04:35.475 --> 04:39.287
And that means I own you.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.422
Hey, Jack, do I look positively glowing?

04:45.518 --> 04:46.997
Well, you do have the wind-battered face

04:47.287 --> 04:49.631
of a New England cod fisherman,
if that's what you're asking.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.498
No! I'm getting married! Jeez!

04:52.592 --> 04:55.004
Lemon, that is wonderful!

04:55.295 --> 04:55.898
To Criss, right?

04:55.995 --> 04:58.032
This isn't one
of those Internet marriage scams

04:58.331 --> 04:59.537
where they prey on the elderly?

04:59.632 --> 05:00.576
Yes, to Criss.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.510
Then, wonderful!

05:02.602 --> 05:05.014
No, but the wedding is not a big deal.
I mean, it's just a...

05:05.305 --> 05:07.307
Oh, my God.
This is the best hug I've ever had.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.545
I know.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.951
Anyway, it's just a formality
for if we want to adopt.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.081
We're going down to City Hall
tomorrow. It's no big whoop.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.983
But it should be a very big whoop!

05:15.081 --> 05:18.790
Lemon, this is your special day.
Plan a real wedding.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.457
I'll get Tony Bennett to sing.

05:20.553 --> 05:24.399
I saved his life at an illegal pai gow
game once. He owes me a favor.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.401
And you can wear
that wedding dress that you bought.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.563
No, I can't. I got rid of that
after Hurricane Irene.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.504
I had forgotten to stock up
on toilet paper,

05:30.596 --> 05:32.837
but I had remembered to stock up
on seven-layer dip --

05:32.932 --> 05:33.603
I got it!

05:33.700 --> 05:34.940
You know, I just don't care
about this stuff.

05:35.034 --> 05:38.015
I don't want a "special day".
I don't want to be a princess.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.515
But, Lemon, you were a little girl once.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.016
Didn't you dream about your wedding?

05:41.107 --> 05:41.949
In my own way.

05:42.041 --> 05:45.488
Sol Rosenbear and I would like
to thank everyone for coming

05:45.578 --> 05:48.354
to our destination wedding
here on the Love Boat.

05:48.448 --> 05:53.090
Unfortunately, Sol has discovered
my previous relationship with Gopher,

05:53.386 --> 05:57.391
so he will be seeking an annulment
once we reach Puerto Vallarta.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.596
I realized a long time ago
that weddings aren't about love.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.833
They're just a giant industry
that preys on gender stereotypes

06:03.930 --> 06:06.570
to make adult women spend a ton of money

06:06.666 --> 06:08.077
and act like selfish children!

06:08.368 --> 06:10.780
I mean, have you ever seen
"Wedding Bitches" on Bravo?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.679
Maybe there's not gonna be a wedding!

06:12.772 --> 06:14.479
You're ruining my special day!

06:14.974 --> 06:17.784
Mom, what the [beep]
are you wearing?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.652
I remember when Bravo used to air operas.

06:19.746 --> 06:23.785
I reject the wedding industry's
phallocentric fairy tale grotesquerie!

06:23.883 --> 06:27.763
So tomorrow Liz Lemon is getting
married in a sweatshirt, no bra!

06:27.854 --> 06:28.832
Oh, for God's sakes, Lemon,

06:28.921 --> 06:31.060
don't take a stand
about your own wedding.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.534
Think about that kid
you're trying to adopt.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.003
What will you tell him
if he asks to see pictures?

06:35.094 --> 06:38.632
I will tell her or if
that I took an amazing stand

06:38.731 --> 06:41.541
against the wedding industrial complex.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.513
We are registered at Popcorn Palace!

06:53.679 --> 06:55.590
All right, now that I'm finished

06:55.681 --> 06:57.558
with my handwriting sample for the FBI,

06:57.650 --> 06:59.891
let's look at your test results.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.457
Oh, this is puzzling, Tracy.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.796
There doesn't seem to be
anything wrong with you at all.

07:04.891 --> 07:05.801
What?

07:05.925 --> 07:08.132
I guess we've replaced
so much of you over the years

07:08.428 --> 07:11.932
that you're maybe not you anymore,
but you're healthy.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.033
No! This isn't happening!

07:14.133 --> 07:15.476
This is good news.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.514
No, it's not!

07:17.603 --> 07:20.140
I always assumed I'd die young
because, you know,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.147
I look so much like James Dean.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.150
And that gave me the freedom
to live without consequences!

07:25.445 --> 07:28.654
That's why I'm always breaking
the law, buying exotic sharks,

07:28.748 --> 07:30.989
forgetting to feed them,
and then trying to hug them!

07:31.083 --> 07:34.530
I couldn't do cool stuff like that
if I knew I'd be alive for --

07:35.621 --> 07:37.066
How many years, Dr. Spaceman?

07:37.156 --> 07:39.466
40. Maybe 50.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.160
I'm sorry.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.940
Look, I'm not happy about this either.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.702
The money I've made
off your health problems

07:44.797 --> 07:46.936
has put me almost all the way
through medical school.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.138
I'm gonna have to start living
like there's a tomorrow.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.578
Open an IRA.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.842
Brush my teeth.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.475
Drink eight glasses a day of that stuff.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.576
You know, clear bathtub juice.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.747
Tracy, I'm afraid I don't have a pamphlet

07:58.845 --> 08:00.085
to help you get through this.

08:00.179 --> 08:04.491
But I do have a pamphlet that has
a bunch of drawings of vaginae.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.154
I'll take it.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.596
To make a long story short, I need
to be let out of my "TGS" contract.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.572
I'm moving to Arizona to be
with my new slave master Terry

08:16.662 --> 08:18.505
to live in a birdcage he built.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.908
- Why don't you both have a seat?
- You may sit.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.945
Now, Terry, I suspect
you know it's illegal

08:24.036 --> 08:26.073
for someone to own another human being.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.743
Fine, but according to the contest rules,

08:28.841 --> 08:33.153
either I collect my prize,
or her equivalent cash value.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.590
Ah, I see. So you'd be just as happy
with the money.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.254
Terry, is this true?

08:38.551 --> 08:39.256
I've done the math,

08:39.552 --> 08:42.556
and taking into account
Jenna's salary and earning potential,

08:42.655 --> 08:46.296
I've calculated that she is worth
$800,000.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.161
Ooh.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.764
Uh, let's say Jenna Was worth that
in her prime.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.240
That was 10 years ago.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.835
She has certainly depreciated since then.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.541
Jenna is becoming
more unemployable by the moment.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.118
And thanks to decades of partying,

09:01.207 --> 09:04.279
Jenna's internal organs will get you
nothing on the black market.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.250
She is an emotional train wreck.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.287
Daddy, why are you doing this?

09:08.581 --> 09:11.619
A 7th-grade education, hepatitis D,

09:11.717 --> 09:15.187
bullet in jaw, fatwa, credit card debt,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.234
wanted by the Yakuza --

09:17.323 --> 09:19.564
Jenna Maroney is worth...

09:22.161 --> 09:23.162
...$2,000.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.266
Fine.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.044
In Arizona, two grand
will buy me a castle

09:27.133 --> 09:28.203
and a pillowcase full of meth.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.115
Make it out to "Doomsday Enterprises".

09:36.242 --> 09:38.017
<i># Missed the Saturday Dance #</i>

09:38.110 --> 09:39.748
<i># Heard they crowded the floor #</i>

09:42.748 --> 09:46.958
<i># Couldn't bear it without you #</i>

09:47.053 --> 09:50.830
<i># Don't get around much anymore #</i>

09:53.859 --> 09:58.274
<i># Dar/in', I guess #</i>

09:58.364 --> 10:02.938
<i># My mind's more at ease #</i>

10:03.035 --> 10:06.778
<i># But nevertheless #</i>

10:07.373 --> 10:11.150
<i># Why stir up memories? #</i>

10:12.011 --> 10:13.649
Good-bye, Bitey.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.158
Well, I guess I need to read
all of these scripts

10:16.248 --> 10:18.785
to determine which one
has the greatest probability

10:18.884 --> 10:21.888
of succeeding in this ever-changing
global marketplace.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.361
I used to only say stuff like that
in my white nerd voice.

10:26.659 --> 10:30.163
<i># Don't get around much anymore #</i>

10:35.868 --> 10:37.074
Jeez, I feel like we're at a deli.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.171
Deli?
Save it for the honeymoon.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.049
Okay, you take our paperwork to the clerk

10:42.141 --> 10:43.347
because black women love you.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.647
Oh! I see you over there,
you little gumdrop.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.657
Don't hide from Shanice!

10:49.148 --> 10:51.025
I'll get us some witnesses,
and then we'll get married

10:51.117 --> 10:52.721
and magically become amazing parents!

10:52.818 --> 10:54.024
Just like the Hiltons!

10:55.755 --> 10:57.826
Oh! Here he comes!

10:57.923 --> 10:59.869
Mmh-mmh-mmh!

10:59.959 --> 11:03.372
I'll give you a bath in the sink
like a baby!

11:03.663 --> 11:05.267
Ooh-wee!

11:05.364 --> 11:07.742
Excuse me, what number are you guys?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.369
Would you be able to stay
and be our witnesses?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
You really didn't invite anyone
to your wedding?

11:11.771 --> 11:13.375
No, I mean, who cares, right?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.914
We're at City Hall.
You guys are wearing Mets t-shirts --

11:16.008 --> 11:18.386
Yeah, 'cause we were wearing them
when we first --

11:18.678 --> 11:19.315
- Met.
- Met.

11:19.445 --> 11:20.685
My God, you're beautiful.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.726
This is the greatest day of my life.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.090
Now, let me guess,
you guys are dressed like that

11:27.186 --> 11:28.290
'cause you met at a laundromat

11:28.387 --> 11:29.923
after you both ran out of clean clothes.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.263
No, it's 'cause this is just
a piece of paper --

11:32.358 --> 11:33.894
That's us! That's our number!

11:33.993 --> 11:35.700
- A04.
- Come on! Come on!

11:35.795 --> 11:36.705
Our number!

11:46.806 --> 11:47.375
You okay?

11:47.473 --> 11:50.181
Yeah. I just thought there'd be
more people here in gym clothes,

11:50.276 --> 11:51.812
carrying bags full of toilet paper.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.320
Look, we don't have to do it this way.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.914
You know, I always imagined
getting married

11:55.014 --> 11:56.891
right when they take your picture
on Splash Mountain.

11:56.982 --> 12:00.156
But weddings are about the bride,
so if you want your special day --

12:00.252 --> 12:01.731
I don't need a special day!

12:01.821 --> 12:04.825
The first wedding I ever went to,
I was a flower girl for my Aunt Linda.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.369
When they said,
"You may now kiss the bride,"

12:06.459 --> 12:08.268
I did my first ever eye-roll.

12:10.496 --> 12:14.842
And today, I honor that little girl's
eye-roll with this masterpiece.

12:21.807 --> 12:25.220
That's how much Liz Lemon cares
about having a special day.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.484
Great. 'Cause I forgot
my birth certificate.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.054
Are you kidding me, Chros?

12:29.148 --> 12:31.458
And even though Shanice said she'd
let it slide if I sat on her hand --

12:31.751 --> 12:33.059
Ugh! What?

12:33.152 --> 12:34.893
Lemon, I haven't seen anything
in the news

12:34.987 --> 12:37.831
about attitudes towards marriage
changing forever

12:37.923 --> 12:39.266
because of one brave woman.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.531
<i>- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.</i>

12:41.827 --> 12:44.330
I e-mailed Tony Bennett
just in case you came to your senses.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.842
He's singing at the White House,
but will cancel for me.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.106
Oh, also, I told him you're Italian,
so he might call you Tina --

12:52.238 --> 12:53.911
Okay. So we'll take another number,
I'll get some witnesses,

12:54.006 --> 12:55.007
you'll get your birth certificate.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.245
<i>It's not wedding stress.</i>

12:56.342 --> 12:57.480
lam no more annoyed right now

12:57.777 --> 13:00.018
than I was when you got that haircut
without consulting me.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.324
Oh, yeah!

13:05.417 --> 13:09.832
Oh, you can walk away from me
all day, you little tiger cub! Raar!

13:11.257 --> 13:15.399
I work at the Marriage Bureau,
but I'll never get married.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.469
Sir, we have a big problem.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.151
I didn't want anyone
to see me like this, she lied.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.809
Jenna, when I said what you were worth,

13:28.908 --> 13:30.410
that was a negotiation tactic.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.079
$2,000, Jack?

13:32.178 --> 13:34.488
I've stolen more than that
from my cleaning lady's purse!

13:34.580 --> 13:37.459
In this market, $2,000
is more than respectable.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.394
I mean, look at Kenneth.
He's worth $5 tops.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.157
I'm gonna hold you to that, sir!

13:43.255 --> 13:44.893
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.061
Everyone around here is human garbage!

13:47.159 --> 13:50.003
Okay, well, then, look at me.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.939
If you're past your prime, then so am I.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.204
I've been divorced twice.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.610
I'm at an age where I no longer
need erectile softeners.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.882
I'm number two
at an American television company,

13:58.971 --> 14:00.575
with no possibility for promotion.

14:00.873 --> 14:03.319
I'll probably die on this job.
I've already had one heart attack.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.949
I used to be a young man with promise.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.956
I coined the phrase, "You wish, pal!"

14:08.047 --> 14:09.219
But now...

14:09.315 --> 14:12.091
I'm sitting here trying to cheer up
a $2,000 actress

14:12.184 --> 14:15.358
because a janitor said
I hurt her feelings, so...

14:16.255 --> 14:19.361
Oh, God.
I'm worth less than you.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.904
Oh! Thank you, Jack!

14:25.264 --> 14:26.868
What are you doing?
Why did you change your clothes?

14:26.966 --> 14:29.344
Well, this is what I was wearing
when we met in Riverside Park.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.641
Remember?
You said, "Nice turtleneck".

14:30.936 --> 14:32.279
<i>No, I said, "Nice turtleneck."</i>

14:32.371 --> 14:33.406
Thank you again!

14:33.505 --> 14:35.985
Great, so now you're more dressed up
than I am at my own wedding.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.577
But whatever.
I got witnesses.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.517
These guys were in the park
either fighting or having sex.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.560
Okay, well, I thought it might be nice
to have a witness we actually know.

14:43.916 --> 14:44.894
Of course, it had to be someone

14:44.984 --> 14:46.327
with nothing to do
on a Wednesday afternoon.

14:46.418 --> 14:47.260
No, no, no, you didn't.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.993
Mazel tov, dummies.
You're Jewish, right, Liz?

14:50.089 --> 14:52.069
Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you?

14:52.191 --> 14:54.137
You forgot your birth certificate,
you invited Dennis.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.261
If you can't take this seriously,

14:55.361 --> 14:56.499
maybe there's not gonna be a wedding!

14:56.595 --> 14:59.974
Okay, is this a big deal or not?

15:00.065 --> 15:03.410
I don't know! It's not the most
important day of my life!

15:03.502 --> 15:05.345
Getting my show picked up,
or meeting you,

15:05.437 --> 15:07.644
or the time I got a sleeve
of Starburst with all pink!

15:07.940 --> 15:09.544
Those were all more important days!

15:09.642 --> 15:12.122
- So you're yelling at me because...?
- Because I'm Liz Lemon!

15:12.211 --> 15:14.350
My parents spent the money
they saved up for my wedding

15:14.446 --> 15:15.584
on a PT Cruiser.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.685
I have been sure for a long time
that this was never gonna happen.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.965
And I was fine with that.
Ergo, it couldn't matter.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.534
Ergo. Affleck's finally
gonna get that Oscar.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.261
Ugh!

15:26.358 --> 15:28.167
And I'm still 90% right.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.206
It's stupid. It doesn't matter.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.674
Guess what? You wasted
a lot of money on that dress.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.672
Oh, actually, it was my grandmother's.

15:34.967 --> 15:38.005
She made it out of parachute silk
while hiding from the Germans.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.207
Shut up!

15:39.305 --> 15:42.115
And then you came along,
and now we're doing this,

15:42.207 --> 15:46.485
and a tiny little part of me
that I hate wants to be a princess!

15:46.578 --> 15:48.717
Liz, it's okay to be a human woman.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.484
No, it's not! It's the worst!
Because of society!

15:52.584 --> 15:54.723
I mean, why do you watch
"Wedding Bitches" in the first place?

15:55.020 --> 15:58.490
And why did I find this hidden
under your underwear ball?

16:06.231 --> 16:07.642
Oh, Rosenbear.

16:07.733 --> 16:11.442
He never got enough time
in his garden before he passed.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.416
I want today to be special.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.611
God, do you have any idea how hard it was

16:16.709 --> 16:18.120
to get you to admit that?

16:18.210 --> 16:21.555
"I forgot my birth certificate.
Let's invite Dennis."

16:21.647 --> 16:23.627
Oh, you were playing me.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.629
- "I'll wear my stupid turtleneck!"
- Wait, you think it's stupid?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.699
We're gonna get married today,
but we're gonna do it right.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.399
We need rings and flowers,

16:30.489 --> 16:32.298
and I'm gonna put on deodorant,
and you're gonna wear a suit

16:32.391 --> 16:34.735
that makes you look
like a little marzipan candy man!

16:35.027 --> 16:39.567
So let's go, people!
IFS my special day!

16:40.466 --> 16:43.709
"Moses of Maryland," page one.

16:44.003 --> 16:48.145
"Open on: Interior Maryland
slave shack, the year 18--"

16:48.240 --> 16:49.742
Aah!

16:52.745 --> 16:54.452
Tracy.

16:54.546 --> 16:55.718
Tracy.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.688
Tracy, it's me, Harriet Tubman.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.230
Harriet? What is this place?

17:01.320 --> 17:04.267
Don't you know? It's your mind.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.097
We aren't so different, you and I.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.226
You grew up in the Bronx.

17:07.326 --> 17:11.273
I grew up Interior Maryland
slave shack, the year 18.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.604
And while I dreamed of becoming
the first woman

17:13.699 --> 17:15.337
to surf around the world --

17:15.434 --> 17:17.505
Really? Is that what you think I did?

17:17.603 --> 17:19.344
I only read the first page of the script!

17:19.438 --> 17:21.076
Use context clues!

17:21.173 --> 17:22.516
Whatever. I'm dead now.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.815
No, Tracy, you are not dead.
I told you, we're in your mind.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.487
Why else would Harriet Tubman

17:26.578 --> 17:29.457
look and sound like your boss,
Jim Dennison?

17:29.548 --> 17:31.118
Oh, come on!
You know that's wrong!

17:31.216 --> 17:34.163
Wait a minute, if this is my mind,
I should be able to control you.

17:34.253 --> 17:35.596
No, no, that only works in dreams.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.667
Eat a corn on the cob and make it sexy!

17:40.659 --> 17:43.765
Great, so I'm not dead. I'm gonna
have to keep on living forever now!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.703
No, my homie --
I can say that because I'm you.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.608
It doesn't matter if you're healthy.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.806
At any moment you could still get hit
by a cab just crossing the street.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.176
Right. So there's still
many ways I could die.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.514
I could fall into a manhole

17:56.608 --> 17:59.145
or I could forget
my chimpanzee's birthday!

17:59.244 --> 18:00.382
It's time to go now.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.755
Time to go back to being Tracy Jordan.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.259
Wake up!

18:05.651 --> 18:07.460
Oh, my God, Tracy!
Are you okay?

18:07.553 --> 18:09.863
I almost died!
I've never been better.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.328
Okay, good, 'cause I'm kind
of in a rush. I'm getting married!

18:12.791 --> 18:14.464
Liz Lemon is getting married today!

18:14.560 --> 18:15.732
Liz Lemon's getting married?

18:15.828 --> 18:19.469
Harry Truman was right!
Anything's possible!

18:19.565 --> 18:20.703
Oh, what a world!

18:21.667 --> 18:22.577
Oh!

18:24.403 --> 18:26.849
I'm fine! Go get married!

18:27.139 --> 18:28.379
Okay!

18:30.609 --> 18:33.590
My next project is gonna be
Toofer's Harriet Tubman movie!

18:33.679 --> 18:35.818
Are you sure, Tray?
It's pretty boring.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.753
I read it in the bath
on one of my "Grizz days."

18:37.850 --> 18:41.491
It's perfect 'cause it's the most
irresponsible choice I can make!

18:41.587 --> 18:45.125
A super-expensive period piece
starring a middle-aged woman?

18:45.224 --> 18:46.669
No one's gonna want to see it!

18:46.758 --> 18:48.829
And I'm probably not gonna be alive
when it comes out!

18:49.695 --> 18:52.232
Now, let's go buy a blimp
and scout locations!

18:57.636 --> 18:58.808
It's about time, Lemon.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.211
Whatever, just get down to City Hall!

19:01.306 --> 19:03.616
It's 30 minutes away.
I'll be there in 10.

19:05.144 --> 19:05.918
<i># Just in time #</i>

19:06.211 --> 19:11.593
Navy. Gray. Maroon. Gray.
Am I depressed? Later!

19:12.417 --> 19:15.591
Oh, you'll do quite nicely.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.826
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

19:17.923 --> 19:20.733
Black Dennis, start the car!

19:22.361 --> 19:25.570
<i># My bridges all were crossed #</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:28.201
<i># Nowhere to go #</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:35.243
What?
It's the only white dress I own.

19:35.908 --> 19:36.886
But your hair!

19:37.176 --> 19:38.519
I'm a princess!

19:42.481 --> 19:44.188
And will you be exchanging rings?

19:45.717 --> 19:48.197
Tito was a drug dealer
the police shot in the face.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.767
In Riverside Park.
Where we first met.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.665
It's perfect.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.898
Do you take this lady as your wife?

19:56.195 --> 19:56.696
I do.

19:56.795 --> 19:57.830
Do you take this --?

19:57.930 --> 19:58.670
I do.

20:00.566 --> 20:04.912
"'But you see,' said Roark quietly,
'I've chosen the work I want to do.

20:05.204 --> 20:10.381
And I can find joy only if I do my
work in the best way possible to me."'

20:18.417 --> 20:20.488
By the authority vested in me
by the State of New York,

20:20.586 --> 20:23.328
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.766
<i># Our love came just in time #</i>

20:25.857 --> 20:28.895
<i># I found you just in time #</i>

20:28.994 --> 20:33.909
<i># You changed my lonely life
that lovely day #</i>

20:33.999 --> 20:35.342
Oh! My lip is caught in the grill!

20:35.434 --> 20:37.846
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

20:40.505 --> 20:44.715
<i># I've got the world on a string,
I'm sittin' on a rainbow #</i>

20:44.810 --> 20:47.484
<i># I've got the string
around my finger #</i>

20:47.579 --> 20:50.287
Lemon, earlier today, I took
a hard look at where life has led me,

20:50.382 --> 20:51.554
and I didn't like what I saw.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.687
But now, looking at you, I realize --

20:53.785 --> 20:54.991
That anything's possible?

20:55.287 --> 20:56.459
You know, I'm attractive.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.592
I've got cheekbones and a pair
you can do something with.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.533
I'm just saying, from a grateful nation,

21:00.626 --> 21:01.866
thank you, Liz Lemon.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.839
There's hope for us all.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.967
Black Dennis got some cop's gun!

21:07.266 --> 21:09.473
<i># I'm sittin' on a rainbow #</i>

21:09.568 --> 21:13.448
<i># Got that string around my finger #</i>

21:13.538 --> 21:15.882
<i># What a world, what a life #</i>

21:15.974 --> 21:21.652
<i># I'm in love #</i>

21:22.305 --> 21:28.309
