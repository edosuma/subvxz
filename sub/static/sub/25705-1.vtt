in our innocence, they make us
to march to fight, to hate,

their games,

00:22.210 --> 00:24.811

39:18.878 --> 39:20.111
That's right.

39:20.113 --> 39:21.345
[exhales]

39:21.347 --> 39:22.749
Yeah, that's nice.

39:24.751 --> 39:27.919
- I like this.
- Yeah. Okay, he's starting to die.

39:27.921 --> 39:30.153
You have to finish
before he dies.

39:30.155 --> 39:31.588
Okay.

39:31.590 --> 39:33.457
Okay, stop now. Stop now.

39:33.459 --> 39:35.059
Don't drink after they're dead.

39:35.061 --> 39:37.765
The old cliche is true. Let's
get out of here. Come on.

39:49.709 --> 39:50.977
[howling]

39:55.247 --> 39:57.117
[Bronson]
They have arrived.

40:05.624 --> 40:07.557
Outside this society, right?

40:07.559 --> 40:09.760
So that we can be safe,

40:09.762 --> 40:13.798
and unnoticed. And now,
somebody is screwing that up

40:13.800 --> 40:17.434
because we are starting
to get a reputation.

40:17.436 --> 40:21.137
It's those low-life
vampire ghouls, isn't it?

40:21.139 --> 40:22.907
Drawing focus to us.

40:22.909 --> 40:25.376
Exactly, and we all know
who they are.

40:25.378 --> 40:26.646
All right.

40:28.381 --> 40:31.615
The point is
when you make a kill,

40:31.617 --> 40:33.917
you leave the body,
all right?

40:33.919 --> 40:35.253
Leave it.

40:35.255 --> 40:38.088
The police might suspect it's
vampires because of the bites,

40:38.090 --> 40:41.559
but a lot of people leave bite marks.
Serial killers leave bite marks.

40:41.561 --> 40:43.193
That don't matter, right?

40:43.195 --> 40:45.863
The only thing that matters
is if one of us is careless,

40:45.865 --> 40:47.664
that blows the whole society,

40:47.666 --> 40:49.869
and we're all dead, right?

40:50.637 --> 40:52.872
So don't fuck up.

40:54.541 --> 40:57.144
- [Ace] To the society.
- [all] To the society.

41:05.718 --> 41:08.188
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure, man. What's up?

41:10.122 --> 41:14.258
I don't know how to say this, especially
after this meeting we just had.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.961
I got an impulse,
I bit a girl.

41:16.963 --> 41:19.166
- We have a new vampire girl.
- You're kidding?

41:20.133 --> 41:21.765
After what Ace just told us?

41:21.767 --> 41:23.867
Dude, we've got to keep
a low profile.

41:23.869 --> 41:27.037
I know, that's why this is really
freaking me out right now.

41:27.039 --> 41:29.941
I really fucked up.
I'm really scared, dude.

41:29.943 --> 41:32.209
- No, you're on your own. I'm sorry, man.
- You've got to help me.

41:32.211 --> 41:35.546
You've been my best friend
since we were little kids.

41:35.548 --> 41:37.213
I know, that's why I made you.

41:37.215 --> 41:39.816
- I know, I know.
- Look, okay.

41:39.818 --> 41:41.484
You've got to keep this chick
away from here.

41:41.486 --> 41:43.687
You don't know
if you can trust her, okay?

41:43.689 --> 41:45.088
Before you make anybody,

41:45.090 --> 41:47.490
anyone at all, you've got
to be clear with all of us,

41:47.492 --> 41:49.093
just like I did with you.

41:49.095 --> 41:51.428
Right, right, I know.
I really fucked up.

41:51.430 --> 41:53.463
Just keep her away from here.

41:53.465 --> 41:55.168
All right, you got it, man.

41:56.135 --> 41:57.635
Ace.

41:57.637 --> 42:00.437
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

42:00.439 --> 42:02.673
Something of vital importance.

42:02.675 --> 42:04.809
- What is it?
- It's about Gage.

42:04.811 --> 42:07.945
Recently,
during one of his kills,

42:07.947 --> 42:11.481
he made his victim
one of us.

42:11.483 --> 42:14.121
And he's keeping it
a secret.

42:15.622 --> 42:18.856
Well, he's probably
ashamed of it, you know,

42:18.858 --> 42:21.225
probably didn't want it
to get around.

42:21.227 --> 42:23.160
He did this impulsively.

42:23.162 --> 42:25.296
Let it go, all right?

42:25.298 --> 42:27.100
- Even if I do...
- Let it go.

42:27.867 --> 42:29.600
[sighs]

42:29.602 --> 42:32.736
I overheard him
telling Daggar

42:32.738 --> 42:35.071
that he did it impulsively.

42:35.073 --> 42:37.475
This can't happen again.

42:37.477 --> 42:40.180
Ace, on this one,
you must listen to me.

42:40.579 --> 42:42.613
Let it go.

42:42.615 --> 42:44.280
You understand?

42:44.282 --> 42:48.753
I don't want you making a fuss about it.
Just let it go.

42:48.755 --> 42:50.756
- Ugh.
- I'll deal with it.

42:52.659 --> 42:55.128
[rock music playing]

43:13.979 --> 43:16.315
Listen, this is where it ends.

43:17.182 --> 43:19.582
Okay? I'm sorry,
this is where it ends.

43:19.584 --> 43:21.755
This is too dangerous.
I can't do this.

43:23.088 --> 43:24.921
No, what?

43:24.923 --> 43:27.957
This isn't funny.
I'm serious, okay?

43:27.959 --> 43:31.294
Listen, there's some things I
gotta tell you before we split.

43:31.296 --> 43:35.499
When you're feeding, you can't drink
when the person's already dead.

43:35.501 --> 43:37.100
You can't go out in the sun.

43:37.102 --> 43:38.568
I mean, you're not going
to like fry

43:38.570 --> 43:41.671
like in vampire movies
you see on TV.

43:41.673 --> 43:43.441
But it'll make you sick, okay?

43:43.443 --> 43:45.608
So, you're gonna
leave me here like this?

43:45.610 --> 43:47.945
It's too dangerous,
we can't be seen together.

43:47.947 --> 43:50.613
You made me.
You're not, we're together.

43:50.615 --> 43:52.682
It doesn't matter.
No, we're not together.

43:52.684 --> 43:55.251
- We are.
- We're not. I'm sorry.

43:55.253 --> 43:56.689
I have to go, okay?

43:57.423 --> 43:59.055
- Don't go.
- [Gage] No.

43:59.057 --> 44:01.293
Come on, let go,
I got to go, I gotta go.

44:38.631 --> 44:42.298
- I have good news for you.
- Really?

44:42.300 --> 44:45.803
I found a way you can
become a human again.

44:45.805 --> 44:48.872
- Are you serious? It can actually be done?
- Uh-hmm. Yes.

44:48.874 --> 44:51.307
The magic book I have,
it talks about transference.

44:51.309 --> 44:55.678
Your soul enters a human body,
you become human again.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.414
That's exactly what I want.

44:57.416 --> 44:58.782
I know,

44:58.784 --> 45:01.285
but you have to be careful. What
if something happens to you?

45:01.287 --> 45:04.254
I mean, you're not immortal
anymore, you could die.

45:04.256 --> 45:07.291
Nah, I don't care.
I want to do it.

45:07.293 --> 45:10.727
Well, I'll find a body,
and we'll make it happen.

45:10.729 --> 45:12.396
You're going to be human again.

45:12.398 --> 45:13.696
- Okay, great.
- We'll do it.

45:13.698 --> 45:15.068
- All right.
- Okay.

45:29.981 --> 45:32.052
[rock music playing]

46:19.631 --> 46:21.233
[bones snapping]

47:17.590 --> 47:20.392
Wow, she's real dead.

47:21.660 --> 47:23.162
And that is something.

47:27.198 --> 47:29.133
I told you.

47:29.135 --> 47:32.068
There's a vampire
out there, people.

47:32.070 --> 47:35.204
And this is the proof
right here.

47:35.206 --> 47:37.276
That girl is dead as a doorknob.

47:46.084 --> 47:48.285
[doorbell ringing]

47:48.287 --> 47:50.787
- Hey, Sophia.
- Hey Johnny.

47:50.789 --> 47:52.088
How you doing?

47:52.090 --> 47:54.490
You look good. You look way
better than your picture.

47:54.492 --> 47:56.794
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

47:56.796 --> 47:59.762
You look good too. You mind
going to the side of the house?

47:59.764 --> 48:01.164
- No, no. Okay.
- There's a door.

48:01.166 --> 48:03.502
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right, I'll see you.

48:07.572 --> 48:10.042
Sophia, Sophia?

48:11.477 --> 48:13.609
- Sophia?
- Hi, Johnny.

48:13.611 --> 48:16.548
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

48:17.450 --> 48:21.017
- Whoa, wow, hey.
- Hi.

48:21.019 --> 48:24.187
- So, thanks for coming over.
- Thanks for having me.

48:24.189 --> 48:28.024
- It's really good to be here.
- Well, tell me about yourself.

48:28.026 --> 48:32.095
I moved here
just a couple of weeks ago

48:32.097 --> 48:33.629
from Pennsylvania.

48:33.631 --> 48:37.704
Um, I came out, you know,
I want to be an actor

48:38.704 --> 48:40.372
and be all...

48:41.573 --> 48:45.108
You have really strong eyes.

48:45.110 --> 48:48.380
You look like an actor.
Aw, you're skin's so soft,

48:48.914 --> 48:50.680
strong body,

48:50.682 --> 48:53.550
- perfect.
- You're kind of perfect.

48:53.552 --> 48:56.523
Wow, well, why don't
you come with me?

49:00.092 --> 49:03.494
- Just relax and I'll be right back, okay?
- Yeah.

49:03.496 --> 49:04.564
[Sophia] Okay, cool.

49:09.101 --> 49:10.637
I found your human body.

49:11.970 --> 49:13.273
You're gonna like it.

49:15.273 --> 49:17.543
All right then, this is it.

49:23.749 --> 49:25.418
Johnny, this is Daggar.

49:27.318 --> 49:30.220
What do you think?
I picked a good one, huh?

49:30.222 --> 49:34.158
I don't care. As long as
he's not fat or disgusting.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.760
So, the way this works
is through transference.

49:36.762 --> 49:40.667
While he becomes more hypnotized
you will yourself into his body.

49:42.700 --> 49:44.303
He's becoming sleepier.

49:46.805 --> 49:48.307
Keep willing.

50:01.720 --> 50:03.490
Oh, my God, it worked.

50:05.657 --> 50:07.726
- Ah.
- How do you feel?

50:08.994 --> 50:13.432
Like a lot of gravity
and fleshy.

50:14.767 --> 50:17.133
Human, I guess,
I don't know.

50:17.135 --> 50:19.970
You're crazy.
Can't believe you did this.

50:19.972 --> 50:23.140
Feel a bit hungry.
You for some...

50:23.142 --> 50:27.176
chicken or meatloaf
or mashed potatoes or...

50:27.178 --> 50:28.945
That's disgusting.

50:28.947 --> 50:31.914
Yeah, this is a little crazy.

50:31.916 --> 50:34.584
Well, have fun
in your human body.

50:34.586 --> 50:36.820
What are you gonna do
about this?

50:36.822 --> 50:39.490
Oh, Bronson
will take care of him.

50:39.492 --> 50:41.461
Just don't get yourself killed.

50:42.628 --> 50:44.064
[exhales]

50:47.733 --> 50:54.073
Sophia, why'd you bring me this
God damn preppy faggot?

50:56.207 --> 50:57.709
This shit's all wrong.

51:04.416 --> 51:07.287
All right, pimpled faced Johnny.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.356
Not too bad,
can work with this.

51:15.293 --> 51:17.596
You fucking kidding me.

51:18.463 --> 51:19.829
Sophia!

51:19.831 --> 51:23.100
All the God damn actors in LA,
and you bring me this

51:23.102 --> 51:25.169
God damn

51:25.171 --> 51:28.738
cock-sucking teenie-weenie
two inch motherfucker.

51:28.740 --> 51:29.775
Fuck.

51:31.477 --> 51:33.709
[Sophia] Size doesn't matter.

51:33.711 --> 51:35.144
Oh, fuck off.

51:35.146 --> 51:39.249
All right, pimple-face Johnny, we're
gonna glam slam you up a bit.

51:39.251 --> 51:40.854
A little bit
of rock and roll here.

51:43.421 --> 51:46.325
Thanks for the body.
See you, Sophia.

51:51.896 --> 51:54.530
They told this guy. Hey, this
is what I'm telling you,

51:54.532 --> 51:56.466
you're gonna have
a lot of problems.

51:56.468 --> 51:58.838
Guess what kind of problems?
Say, use your imagination.

51:59.805 --> 52:01.271
Hey, guys,
what can I do for you?

52:01.273 --> 52:03.006
Can I get some
bling bling at all?

52:03.008 --> 52:04.240
Thank you.

52:04.242 --> 52:05.908
[indistinct chatter]

52:05.910 --> 52:07.878
Oh, Bruno.

52:07.880 --> 52:09.648
[Frankie] Oh, Bruno, come on.

52:11.983 --> 52:13.352
Bruno, Bruno.

52:14.385 --> 52:15.785
[man] That's a DVD movie.

52:15.787 --> 52:19.088
- A movie about what?
- About a real vampire.

52:19.090 --> 52:21.226
Hey, Uncle, check this out.

52:21.760 --> 52:23.193
What was that?

52:23.195 --> 52:24.428
Do you believe in vampires?

52:24.430 --> 52:27.030
I believe in vampires
100 percent, sir.

52:27.032 --> 52:29.066
Is this a Halloween kinda prank?

52:29.068 --> 52:32.468
- No, I catch him in the act.
- What?

52:32.470 --> 52:34.905
And I taped it on my camera.

52:34.907 --> 52:37.374
He's a real vampire in action.

52:37.376 --> 52:39.343
This better be real
or I'm going to kick your ass.

52:39.345 --> 52:41.311
I can 100% guarantee.

52:41.313 --> 52:42.345
Take my word for it.

52:42.347 --> 52:44.847
- Real vampires.
- Real vampires.

52:44.849 --> 52:47.084
- How much do you want for it?
- Twenty dollars.

52:47.086 --> 52:49.522
Uncle, it's probably some dumb
reality show.

52:50.021 --> 52:51.320
Twenty-five in that.

52:51.322 --> 52:53.289
- Keep the change.
- Remember what he said.

52:53.291 --> 52:55.124
It's a bit of warranty.

52:55.126 --> 52:56.862
Two block guarantee, thanks.

52:59.097 --> 53:02.164
[Frankie] I want to go see if this is
a fake. Let's go watch this thing.

53:02.166 --> 53:03.802
[Bruno] Yeah, it's a...
I agree with you there.

53:21.287 --> 53:24.187
What the fuck
are you doing here?

53:24.189 --> 53:26.960
I followed you that night
after you left me.

53:28.126 --> 53:29.728
We're so fucked
if we get caught.

53:30.928 --> 53:32.428
Oh, my God.

53:32.430 --> 53:33.932
You haven't been feeding,
have you?

53:34.967 --> 53:36.899
I can only think of you.

53:36.901 --> 53:40.340
Listen, you can't ever come here
again looking for me, okay?

53:41.639 --> 53:42.838
Okay.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.409
Okay, let's go, let's go.

53:58.090 --> 53:59.289
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

53:59.291 --> 54:00.959
Yeah, can we use your phone?

54:01.760 --> 54:02.992
What's the problem?

54:02.994 --> 54:06.262
Um, our car broke down,
I need to call a tow truck.

54:06.264 --> 54:07.463
- Me and my girlfriend.
- Hi.

54:07.465 --> 54:09.066
Um, don't you think
it's a little late?

54:09.068 --> 54:11.501
It'll only take us a second, I
swear, we're just going to come in,

54:11.503 --> 54:13.736
use the phone, and we'll
leave as soon as I hang up

54:13.738 --> 54:15.574
with the tow-truck drive,
I promise.

54:16.508 --> 54:18.811
- Okay, I guess that's all right.
- Come on in.

54:21.380 --> 54:23.383
The phone's through the
kitchen in the other room.

54:25.351 --> 54:27.287
Whoa, what's going on here?

54:29.921 --> 54:31.887
[bones snapping]

54:31.889 --> 54:32.924
[whimpers]

54:52.477 --> 54:54.079
Okay, come on, that's enough.

55:01.352 --> 55:04.490
Oh, much better, much
better, come on, lets go.

55:17.535 --> 55:20.070
- Hey.
- What's happening?

55:20.072 --> 55:21.506
What's wrong?

55:22.240 --> 55:23.606
No, no, I'm fine.

55:23.608 --> 55:26.545
I can read you.
Here, brought you this.

55:27.479 --> 55:28.981
Thanks. Little gift?

55:30.115 --> 55:31.580
What's the occasion?

55:31.582 --> 55:34.052
Because I can tell
something's wrong.

55:36.622 --> 55:37.824
I'm fine.

55:38.157 --> 55:39.923
Really.

55:39.925 --> 55:42.562
I can read you,
come on, what's wrong?

55:43.628 --> 55:46.562
If I tell you this,
you can't tell anybody else.

55:46.564 --> 55:48.534
- Okay, I won't.
- All right.

55:49.367 --> 55:50.969
I was out feeding

55:51.637 --> 55:54.037
couple of nights ago, and...

55:54.039 --> 55:58.111
You know, like, I got this crazy crazy
impulse and I saw this girl and I...

55:59.211 --> 56:00.747
got her, you know.

56:01.646 --> 56:03.982
- Now she's one of us.
- You did what?

56:04.650 --> 56:05.617
Yeah.

56:06.385 --> 56:07.883
If Ace finds out about this

56:07.885 --> 56:10.553
<i>you know he doesn't
like to fuck around.</i>

56:10.555 --> 56:12.756
I know, I don't know,
what am I going to do?

56:12.758 --> 56:16.193
Well, you know, maybe she'll
disappear and leave you alone.

56:16.195 --> 56:19.428
Well, she does know
where we live.

56:19.430 --> 56:21.530
What? How does she know that?

56:21.532 --> 56:23.168
She must have followed me.

56:24.503 --> 56:26.602
You didn't feel her
tracking you?

56:26.604 --> 56:28.204
I just saw her last night

56:28.206 --> 56:31.173
and I was looking out, and she was
on the other side of the gate.

56:31.175 --> 56:33.376
I could take care of her
for you.

56:33.378 --> 56:35.648
No, I think I've done enough
to her.

56:37.249 --> 56:39.584
Okay, I hope so.

56:41.186 --> 56:42.822
[Daggar] Check out the new den.

56:49.561 --> 56:51.764
Smells like fucking
rat piss in here.

56:52.965 --> 56:55.700
I'm a fucking rock star.
I can't live like this.

56:57.468 --> 57:00.903
Fuck! There's fucking God damn
trash on the floor.

57:00.905 --> 57:02.441
Who lives like this?

57:10.849 --> 57:12.151
Human.

57:12.918 --> 57:14.986
Fucking sucks.

57:21.226 --> 57:23.863
Rats... He's got rats.

57:28.467 --> 57:30.035
- Pick up.
- [phone ringing]

57:33.204 --> 57:35.372
Aye, hey.

57:35.374 --> 57:38.611
Did you investigate
this mother fucker?

57:39.077 --> 57:40.709
At all?

57:40.711 --> 57:43.847
What? Did you know he has
like three God damn dollars?

57:43.849 --> 57:46.619
And fucking rats
the size of my head?

57:47.952 --> 57:49.921
Fuck you, Sophia.

57:55.660 --> 57:57.496
So far being human sucks.

57:59.064 --> 58:00.162
But I'm hungry.

58:00.164 --> 58:02.701
Food is good. What's
this guy got to eat?

58:06.438 --> 58:08.673
Chocolate should taste
better than this.

58:13.678 --> 58:15.412
Ooh, I forgot about...

58:15.414 --> 58:16.948
[burps] That sensation.

58:35.066 --> 58:36.802
Oh! There you go.

58:38.003 --> 58:39.572
[woman moaning]

58:41.139 --> 58:44.242
Oh, burns, burns, burns.

58:55.486 --> 58:57.122
[doorbell ringing]

59:00.291 --> 59:01.825
This is for you.

59:01.827 --> 59:03.994
You're not
going to fucking believe this.

59:03.996 --> 59:05.327
What is this?

59:05.329 --> 59:07.664
It's Gage participating
in a kill.

59:07.666 --> 59:10.068
- On DVD.
- [Frankie] Yes.

59:11.936 --> 59:13.202
How do you know
it's Gage?

59:13.204 --> 59:15.807
It's so fucking clear.
I can read his tattoos.

59:16.173 --> 59:17.576
Really?

59:18.577 --> 59:22.579
And may I ask
how did you acquire this?

59:22.581 --> 59:25.115
Well, first of all,
it's not any stores.

59:25.117 --> 59:28.283
One man, one peddler
was selling this.

59:28.285 --> 59:30.419
And I think he made the movie.

59:30.421 --> 59:34.157
Interesting, thank you.

59:34.159 --> 59:38.595
[Bronson] Thank you very much. I
must show this to Ace immediately.

59:38.597 --> 59:39.899
Excuse me, please.

59:45.202 --> 59:49.007
You've got to see this.
You won't believe it.

59:49.573 --> 59:51.307
What's on there?

59:51.309 --> 59:55.544
Hmm, Gage was followed
during one of his recent kills.

59:55.546 --> 59:58.113
And he was videotaped.

59:58.115 --> 01:00:00.249
It's being sold
by a street salesman,

01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:04.055
to everyone,
the same one who made this.

01:00:05.557 --> 01:00:07.890
Okay, I want you to get
all of this shit.

01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:10.760
I need
every one of them back, recall.

01:00:10.762 --> 01:00:13.896
All right,
and recall the guy too.

01:00:13.898 --> 01:00:15.497
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

01:00:15.499 --> 01:00:16.966
- All right.
- Exactly.

01:00:16.968 --> 01:00:18.233
Good.

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:19.771
I'll deal with Gage.

01:00:30.749 --> 01:00:32.218
[bones snapping]

01:00:35.086 --> 01:00:36.322
[exhales sharply]

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.037
- Who are you?
- I'm Sophia.

01:00:55.039 --> 01:00:57.809
- I'm here because of Gage?
- Gage?

01:00:58.642 --> 01:01:02.014
- That fucking bastard.
- Sit down.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:11.588
I know what Gage did to you
was wrong. He knows it.

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:14.289
But you've got to let him go.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:16.358
No, no.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.729
No, I don't want to let him go.

01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:24.434
But you can have an amazing vampire
life if you just forget about him.

01:01:24.436 --> 01:01:26.135
No.

01:01:26.137 --> 01:01:29.037
I don't want to forget about him.
Look what he's done to me.

01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:30.976
I don't want to live this way.

01:01:33.445 --> 01:01:36.079
I don't want to be alone.

01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:39.816
- I want to kill him.
- Doesn't have to be that way.

01:01:39.818 --> 01:01:41.887
I don't want to live this way.

01:01:43.722 --> 01:01:45.091
I want to die.

01:01:45.724 --> 01:01:48.093
- Are you sure?
- Ya.

01:01:50.327 --> 01:01:51.796
I'm sure.

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:53.432
I wanna die.

01:01:58.736 --> 01:02:00.039
[Sophia] Okay.

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.760
This will be painless.

01:03:06.204 --> 01:03:07.872
What a shame.

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:26.892
Shiny.

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:36.765
Well, tickle my pickle,
I'll bet your a vampire.

01:03:36.767 --> 01:03:40.637
- I'm not a vampire.
- Oh, man, I've seen it.

01:03:40.639 --> 01:03:42.405
- You're a vampire.
- No, I'm not.

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:46.044
I've seen those teeth, man.
You've gotta bite me.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:47.977
You got to, man.

01:03:47.979 --> 01:03:50.479
I'm telling you, I've been
bitten by just about everything

01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:51.814
that roams this Earth.

01:03:51.816 --> 01:03:55.417
Sharks, alligators, snakes...

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:59.088
And I'd like to be bitten
by a vampire as well.

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.758
First of all,
I'm not a vampire.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.559
Second of all,
you haven't pissed me off.

01:04:03.561 --> 01:04:07.900
Well, maybe, I can piss you off
by shoving you.

01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:11.136
- Yeah.
- Now you pissed me off.

01:04:11.635 --> 01:04:13.037
Uh, yeah.

01:04:14.972 --> 01:04:16.472
- Yeah.
- Nah, you're not worth it.

01:04:16.474 --> 01:04:21.109
Get out of here.
Happy Halloween, jackass.

01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:24.383
- About time you got here.
- I'm sorry I'm late. I got held up.

01:04:27.785 --> 01:04:29.188
Oh, there he is.

01:04:30.088 --> 01:04:32.921
- Mike.
- Hey, come on.

01:04:32.923 --> 01:04:34.856
- How you doing?
- I want to talk to you.

01:04:34.858 --> 01:04:38.494
I want to buy some of those vampire DVDs.
Where are they?

01:04:38.496 --> 01:04:39.861
I got a lot of them...

01:04:39.863 --> 01:04:41.129
I'll take those.
I'll buy that.

01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:42.865
- I've got some at the house.
- At your house?

01:04:42.867 --> 01:04:45.334
- Give my assistant your address.
- Sure.

01:04:45.336 --> 01:04:48.439
- 5624, Kansas Avenue.
- [Frankie] Write that down.

01:04:49.773 --> 01:04:52.108
- You got it?
- Come in the morning.

01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:53.443
- [Frankie] Perfect.
- Sure.

01:04:53.445 --> 01:04:55.381
I gotta tell you something
really funny, listen.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.448
[groans]

01:05:00.885 --> 01:05:03.019
- You're one of them?
- Yes.

01:05:03.021 --> 01:05:05.187
- Don't bite me.
- I'm not going to bite you.

01:05:05.189 --> 01:05:08.091
- He's going to bite you.
- I don't bite dudes.

01:05:08.093 --> 01:05:09.662
I only bite hot chicks, man.

01:05:10.494 --> 01:05:11.995
Now you've got attitude.

01:05:11.997 --> 01:05:13.595
I've got an asshole
working for me.

01:05:13.597 --> 01:05:15.999
How do you do that?
These are my friends.

01:05:16.001 --> 01:05:18.901
You think you can do anything about
vampires? They're my buddies.

01:05:18.903 --> 01:05:20.470
Say goodnight!

01:05:20.472 --> 01:05:21.674
[bones snap]

01:05:23.073 --> 01:05:24.874
You've got to come get me.

01:05:24.876 --> 01:05:28.414
This whole experience is a frigging
disaster. I want to come back.

01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:36.051
[groans] It's me, it's Daggar.

01:05:36.053 --> 01:05:39.588
- Fuck. [groans]
- Gage, stop, it's Daggar.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.591
It's Daggar, stop.

01:05:41.593 --> 01:05:43.225
What are you talking about?

01:05:43.227 --> 01:05:46.995
He transferred himself into a human body.
You're going to kill him.

01:05:46.997 --> 01:05:49.032
Oh, come on.
That's not fucking Daggar.

01:05:49.034 --> 01:05:53.068
It's fucking daggar, dude. We fucking met on
the first day of the fucking third grade,

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:56.972
fucking shared a cigarette in the
fucking bathroom, you fucking asshole.

01:05:56.974 --> 01:05:59.274
- Yeah.
- That's true.

01:05:59.276 --> 01:06:02.278
Can't believe
you fucking bit me, man.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.213
Enough of this human bullshit.
I need my body back right now.

01:06:05.215 --> 01:06:07.450
Dude, you are human.
That's why I bit you.

01:06:07.452 --> 01:06:09.385
Fuck off, man.
Can we do this?

01:06:09.387 --> 01:06:13.559
Okay, okay, okay. You guys calm down.
Again, concentrate.

01:06:14.659 --> 01:06:16.258
Just like you did before.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.564
Will yourself into his body
with all your might, Daggar.

01:06:20.898 --> 01:06:23.198
Pull harder, you can do it.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.470
- Come on, Daggar, you don't want to be stuck...
- Fuck, it's not working.

01:06:27.472 --> 01:06:29.571
I can't even see
his fucking eyes.

01:06:29.573 --> 01:06:33.108
You've gotta concentrate harder, or else
you're going to be stuck in his body.

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:35.246
Concentrate, come on.

01:06:36.347 --> 01:06:38.283
Come on, Daggar.
You can do it.

01:06:50.528 --> 01:06:51.796
I'm back.

01:06:53.064 --> 01:06:54.767
- I'm back.
- Daggar.

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.666
- God.
- Holy shit.

01:06:57.668 --> 01:06:59.334
Sophia, thank you.

01:06:59.336 --> 01:07:01.706
I was almost stuck inside
that body forever.

01:07:03.173 --> 01:07:05.543
- Where am I?
- [Daggar] You...

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.209
[Gage] What? Dude.

01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:09.979
You bit me.
You almost took my immortality.

01:07:09.981 --> 01:07:12.215
Look at this guy,
that's not you.

01:07:12.217 --> 01:07:16.488
- I saw this. I didn't see you. I saw this guy...
- Gage, you're out of control.

01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:18.521
I am sorry, man.

01:07:18.523 --> 01:07:21.791
- I love you, dude. I would never...
- I'm back.

01:07:21.793 --> 01:07:25.327
- That was close. Thought you were going...
- [Gage] Sorry, man.

01:07:25.329 --> 01:07:29.265
- Did I pass out or what?
- Yeah, yeah, you passed out.

01:07:29.267 --> 01:07:32.401
Well, I want this guy now then.

01:07:32.403 --> 01:07:33.903
I'm going to give him a break.

01:07:33.905 --> 01:07:35.338
But it's not Daggar.

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.207
- [Sophia] I know but I want to let him go.
- Do what she says.

01:07:38.209 --> 01:07:39.908
- Get it out of here.
- All right. All right.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.280
[Sophia] I don't know.

01:07:42.213 --> 01:07:44.180
All right, later, fish food.

01:07:44.182 --> 01:07:45.981
What's with those guys?

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:47.617
Oh, they're my friends.

01:07:47.619 --> 01:07:51.887
- Looking at me funny.
- Well, they can be a little rowdy.

01:07:51.889 --> 01:07:53.421
Why does my neck hurt?

01:07:53.423 --> 01:07:56.526
Oh, we were making out
all night.

01:07:56.528 --> 01:07:59.262
- Huh?
- Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

01:07:59.264 --> 01:08:01.296
Dude, I'm sorry, man.

01:08:01.298 --> 01:08:02.597
[Daggar] We have to talk.

01:08:02.599 --> 01:08:05.033
- Well, you have a good night.
- I'm going now?

01:08:05.035 --> 01:08:06.804
Yeah, don't you want to?

01:08:07.572 --> 01:08:09.405
- Um...
- Yeah.

01:08:09.407 --> 01:08:11.640
- Okay. You're gonna call me?
- You have a good night.

01:08:11.642 --> 01:08:15.246
- Yeah, okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:08:17.148 --> 01:08:18.584
[sighs]

01:08:20.451 --> 01:08:23.319
- [Sophia] So, what was it like?
- What was it like?

01:08:23.321 --> 01:08:26.122
It was horrible, it was hell.

01:08:26.124 --> 01:08:28.990
- Ah.
- Humans are so dull, they have no senses.

01:08:28.992 --> 01:08:31.593
Duh, I could've told you that.

01:08:31.595 --> 01:08:35.330
It's so great to be back,
start to feel the gravity.

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:37.800
This city is so ugly
during the day time.

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:41.270
- I need to feed.
- Yeah, let's go. come on, man.

01:08:41.272 --> 01:08:44.143
Bronson,
what's the with attitude?

01:08:45.143 --> 01:08:46.545
Seriously.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:49.078
Maybe it's because

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.314
I know what you did
and Ace does too.

01:08:53.317 --> 01:08:57.819
- What did I do?
- Oh, you know what you did. You know exactly what you did.

01:08:57.821 --> 01:09:00.455
If I did, where would you
get your information from?

01:09:00.457 --> 01:09:01.756
[scoffs]

01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:03.124
Don't worry about it.

01:09:03.126 --> 01:09:04.725
I'm not worried about it,

01:09:04.728 --> 01:09:07.131
'cause if it was a big deal, Ace
would have said something to me.

01:09:07.464 --> 01:09:08.832
[roars]

01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:18.309
Ace is a lot nicer of a person
than I am.

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:20.612
[bones snapping]

01:09:26.049 --> 01:09:27.749
I've never done anything to you.

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:31.587
Would you like the entire list?
Or just the top 10?

01:09:31.589 --> 01:09:33.055
Well, if you're gonna be
like that,

01:09:33.057 --> 01:09:35.624
why don't we just shorten it way
down and just get to the top five?

01:09:35.626 --> 01:09:38.261
You're rude, you're arrogant,

01:09:38.263 --> 01:09:42.162
you're careless,
you're sloppy.

01:09:42.165 --> 01:09:45.001
You endanger our very lives.

01:09:45.002 --> 01:09:47.136
You threaten
our very existence.

01:09:47.138 --> 01:09:50.006
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:09:50.008 --> 01:09:52.173
- Fuck you, man.
- [groans]

01:09:52.175 --> 01:09:53.477
[Gage] Whatever.

01:10:33.718 --> 01:10:34.885
Hello.

01:10:36.487 --> 01:10:38.253
Hi.

01:10:38.255 --> 01:10:40.691
What's your name?
My name's Belinda.

01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:42.824
Oh, Belinda.

01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:44.593
Hmm, my name's Gage.

01:10:44.595 --> 01:10:49.601
- What are you doing here?
- Basically I'm throwing my ball to catch one of the leaves.

01:10:50.434 --> 01:10:53.371
Oh, hmm, interesting, well.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.909
You seem pretty good
with the ball.

01:11:07.852 --> 01:11:10.022
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Belinda, I got to go.

01:11:10.655 --> 01:11:11.822
Look at this.

01:11:27.938 --> 01:11:29.971
Okay, stop, just please stop.

01:11:29.973 --> 01:11:31.677
[bones snapping]

01:11:43.787 --> 01:11:48.123
No, no.

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:51.927
[Ace] <i>If one of us is careless
it blows our whole society,</i>

01:11:51.929 --> 01:11:53.832
and we're all dead forever.

01:11:54.831 --> 01:11:56.834
So, don't fuck up.

01:11:59.603 --> 01:12:01.005
So sorry.

01:12:02.572 --> 01:12:05.811
- Gage, you're out of control.
- You're careless.

01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:10.311
You're sloppy.

01:12:10.313 --> 01:12:15.450
<i>You endanger our very lives, you
threaten our very existence.</i>

01:12:15.452 --> 01:12:17.054
[Gage] Oh, really?

01:12:22.393 --> 01:12:23.862
[bones snapping]

01:12:31.169 --> 01:12:32.834
Hey, dude.

01:12:32.836 --> 01:12:34.837
Dude, you're
fucking hard, man. Wow.

01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:36.504
And here you are.

01:12:36.506 --> 01:12:38.507
- Ace is going to kill me.
- What now?

01:12:38.509 --> 01:12:39.675
I mean
he fucking knows everything,

01:12:39.677 --> 01:12:42.544
he knows
about the fucking chick.

01:12:42.546 --> 01:12:45.748
- He knows about the video.
- What fucking video?

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.382
[Gage]
I don't know, it's fucked up.

01:12:47.384 --> 01:12:48.818
I'm fucking dead.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.520
- Just hide me out.
- Oh, fuck that.

01:12:51.522 --> 01:12:54.323
We're not hiding him from Ace.
He'll kill us all.

01:12:54.325 --> 01:12:56.292
Where the fuck
is your loyalty?

01:12:56.294 --> 01:12:58.993
He left us
for fucking Daggar.

01:12:58.995 --> 01:13:01.163
You can hide out here
as long as you have to.

01:13:01.165 --> 01:13:03.402
Fuck, get the fuck
out of my way.

01:13:04.168 --> 01:13:05.836
Hey, you need to really relax.

01:13:06.269 --> 01:13:07.770
I'll relax.

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:10.205
I'll relax
when I'm fucking dead.

01:13:10.207 --> 01:13:13.007
I think you need to help yourself
to a little bit of Lola here.

01:13:13.009 --> 01:13:14.376
She can help you whine down.

01:13:14.378 --> 01:13:17.512
That's the fucking last thing I want to do.
You fucking crazy?

01:13:17.514 --> 01:13:19.981
No, I think it's the first
thing you have to do.

01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:21.883
Fuck, I don't know.

01:13:21.885 --> 01:13:23.187
Sure, you do.

01:13:25.356 --> 01:13:26.758
[moans appreciatively]

01:13:27.959 --> 01:13:29.461
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:37.468 --> 01:13:39.334
Think I've had too much
to drink.

01:13:39.336 --> 01:13:40.938
No, drink more.

01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:44.507
I like champagne,
this is good champagne.

01:13:44.509 --> 01:13:45.944
Tastes wonderful.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.479
You like necks.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.450
- I love necks.
- Hmm.

01:13:56.454 --> 01:13:58.023
[moans]

01:13:59.557 --> 01:14:01.492
[bones snapping]

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.638
Daggar.

01:14:15.171 --> 01:14:16.640
Daggar.

01:14:17.308 --> 01:14:18.707
Daggar.

01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:21.443
God dammit,
can't you see I'm busy?

01:14:21.445 --> 01:14:24.312
Ace wants you
to go find Gage.

01:14:24.314 --> 01:14:25.948
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:28.918
You're the only one
that knows where he is.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.957
- Why the fuck do I have to do this?
- Because he fucked up again.

01:14:33.624 --> 01:14:36.027
[groans] God dammit.

01:14:42.732 --> 01:14:45.700
Great, there you are, man.
Guess what?

01:14:45.702 --> 01:14:47.569
Party's over, it's time to go.

01:14:47.571 --> 01:14:49.771
Oh, man. I can't go anywhere.
I'm not going.

01:14:49.773 --> 01:14:52.874
- You got no choice, man.
- You know Ace is going to kill me.

01:14:52.876 --> 01:14:55.276
God dammit, you got no choice.

01:14:55.278 --> 01:14:57.178
He's staying right fucking here.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.016
- Yeah, man, I mean, come on.
- It's not up to them, man.

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.418
It's not up to you,
it's not up to us.

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.689
- It's up to Ace.
- God dammit, don't you guys fucking realize

01:15:06.691 --> 01:15:08.257
that he's going
to get us all killed.

01:15:08.259 --> 01:15:09.757
Stay the fuck out of this.

01:15:09.759 --> 01:15:12.962
We answer to Ace,
all of us.

01:15:12.964 --> 01:15:15.767
You're coming with me,
right now, let's go.

01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:20.602
I got to go, man,
I'll see you.

01:15:20.604 --> 01:15:23.741
Don't do it,
don't you fucking go.

01:15:52.969 --> 01:15:54.138
Stay right there.

01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:58.841
As long
as we've been in society,

01:15:58.843 --> 01:16:02.080
nobody has gone to the outside
world and given up our secrets.

01:16:02.746 --> 01:16:05.584
This is yours, is it not?

01:16:07.351 --> 01:16:09.251
This is going to make us

01:16:09.253 --> 01:16:12.186
hounded and hunted for the
rest of our immortal lives.

01:16:12.188 --> 01:16:15.556
And it's you, it's your fault,
you're the first.

01:16:15.558 --> 01:16:17.325
These are all recalled
and destroyed.

01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:20.928
The guy that was making them has
also been recalled and destroyed.

01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:23.034
The only problem there
is you, right?

01:16:23.401 --> 01:16:24.603
You.

01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:32.210
I've decided
to let this one go.

01:16:33.443 --> 01:16:39.017
If you fuck up once more,
that's the end of you, got it?

01:16:39.482 --> 01:16:40.884
[Gage] Yeah, yes.

01:16:42.219 --> 01:16:43.655
All right.

01:16:46.122 --> 01:16:50.995
My mom's at work, and my dad drank
too much wine, so he's asleep.

01:16:51.562 --> 01:16:52.927
No.

01:16:52.929 --> 01:16:54.865
[Ace] You killed a child?

01:17:00.336 --> 01:17:02.040
[screams]

01:17:34.604 --> 01:17:36.073
[thuds]

01:17:39.677 --> 01:17:41.780
He ain't gonna
fuck that up again.

01:18:19.015 --> 01:18:20.785
[Gage] <i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

01:18:21.451 --> 01:18:23.088
<i>You'll know what to do.</i>

01:18:29.692 --> 01:18:32.329
It's good to be back.

01:18:35.532 --> 01:18:37.168
[heart beating]

01:18:53.017 --> 01:18:55.519
How many years did you
spend working on that?

01:18:56.387 --> 01:18:57.919
Quite a few.

01:18:57.921 --> 01:19:00.087
You know, I had lots
of hidden cameras,

01:19:00.089 --> 01:19:02.126
and obviously some reenactments.

01:19:03.893 --> 01:19:09.163
- The animation was a nice touch.
- Uh-hmm, I hired someone.

01:19:09.165 --> 01:19:13.771
As I said, this was meant
to be a present for Ace.

01:19:14.437 --> 01:19:15.939
I'll give him your best.

01:19:16.773 --> 01:19:18.809
No hard feelings I hope.

01:19:19.876 --> 01:19:22.610
Oh, sure, no hard feelings.

01:19:22.612 --> 01:19:26.416
I'll just have to drink blood
through a straw now, thanks to you.

01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:34.323
Let's get out of here. Go get Ike,
tell him his play time's over.

01:19:34.325 --> 01:19:35.559
Yes, sir, Mr. Cross.

01:19:37.695 --> 01:19:39.130
I have one more question.

01:19:43.634 --> 01:19:45.069
Ike, we're leaving.

01:19:46.269 --> 01:19:48.005
Quit fucking around.

01:19:49.272 --> 01:19:50.474
Ike!

01:19:51.575 --> 01:19:52.943
[groans]

01:20:02.085 --> 01:20:04.856
Ace did kill Gage,
I remember when that happened.

01:20:05.923 --> 01:20:07.788
Yes, he did.

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:09.757
Gage broke that carnal rule,

01:20:09.759 --> 01:20:12.095
"Never drink from a child."

01:20:13.563 --> 01:20:14.432
What happened to the girl?

01:20:29.812 --> 01:20:32.217
Ike, I'm talking to you.

01:20:35.385 --> 01:20:37.155
- Ike?
- Ah, no, no.

01:20:38.354 --> 01:20:39.490
[groans]

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.897
I wonder if fangs grow back.

01:20:50.099 --> 01:20:52.700
Where the hell
are those two guys?

01:20:52.702 --> 01:20:54.669
[woman] Hey!

01:20:54.671 --> 01:20:56.640
Hey, where'd you guys go?

01:20:57.808 --> 01:21:00.044
Hello?

01:21:04.147 --> 01:21:05.282
What?

01:21:06.317 --> 01:21:07.585
What's going on?

01:21:08.451 --> 01:21:09.920
Where am I?

01:21:11.487 --> 01:21:13.120
[guffaws]

01:21:13.122 --> 01:21:16.361
Oh, shit, you're still alive.

01:21:18.329 --> 01:21:19.528
[chuckles]

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:23.699
- Who is she?
- Oh, just a girl I picked up at the bar.

01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:26.767
Brought her and her friend over
to share with you.

01:21:26.769 --> 01:21:29.439
Hey, you didn't pick me up.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:32.606
I picked you up.

01:21:32.608 --> 01:21:36.146
I think you got yourself
confused there, sweet cheeks.

01:21:42.286 --> 01:21:44.689
No, you are.

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:47.959
And gullible.

01:21:48.491 --> 01:21:50.025
And dead.

01:21:50.027 --> 01:21:51.793
I'm dead right here.

01:21:51.795 --> 01:21:52.894
Not for long.

01:21:52.896 --> 01:21:54.962
[screams]

01:21:54.964 --> 01:21:56.566
- Charlie!
- [groans]

01:21:57.835 --> 01:21:59.637
What did you inject me with?

01:22:00.637 --> 01:22:02.139
My own invention.

01:22:02.939 --> 01:22:06.475
Concentrated colloidal silver...

01:22:06.477 --> 01:22:07.577
Should do the trick.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:14.619
[groaning]

01:22:29.032 --> 01:22:30.701
Who the hell are you?

01:22:31.535 --> 01:22:32.970
Belinda Daniels.

01:22:36.205 --> 01:22:38.141
The little girl jumping rope.

01:22:38.976 --> 01:22:40.577
Not so little anymore.

01:22:48.352 --> 01:22:50.354
Your vamp wenches are history.

01:22:50.853 --> 01:22:52.453
How?

01:22:52.455 --> 01:22:54.592
Good ol' fashioned wooden stake
for Ike.

01:22:55.793 --> 01:22:57.228
Ike?

01:23:00.696 --> 01:23:02.830
Think fast, asshole.

01:23:02.832 --> 01:23:06.470
And then my little blue ball full of
holy water took care of the other one.

01:23:07.504 --> 01:23:09.404
Holy water!

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:12.541
- You bitch!
- The name's not bitch.

01:23:12.543 --> 01:23:15.213
- My name's Belinda.
- It's Belinda.

01:23:22.152 --> 01:23:27.055
Look, I didn't have anything
to do with this.

01:23:27.057 --> 01:23:29.858
I'm not part
of the Sunset Society.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.026
I'm not even a vampire.

01:23:32.028 --> 01:23:34.264
No, you just work for them.

01:23:50.914 --> 01:23:52.413
[gasps]

01:23:52.415 --> 01:23:56.553
Luckily, silver daggers kill
both humans and vampire alike.

01:23:58.155 --> 01:24:01.125
- How long have you been hunting us?
- Twelve years.

01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:04.159
Ever since Gage bit me.

01:24:04.161 --> 01:24:05.530
[bones snapping]

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:09.064
[Sophia] He didn't turn you?

01:24:09.066 --> 01:24:12.633
Or kill me.
Almost but not quite.

01:24:12.635 --> 01:24:18.006
I've been looking for you
for a long long time.

01:24:18.008 --> 01:24:23.979
I knew Charlie couldn't resist the
innocent catholic school girl routine.

01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:27.882
It was so easy to convince him to
bring Becky and I home with him,

01:24:27.884 --> 01:24:30.418
so that I could finally
meet you.

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:33.291
- Why me?
- You're the one that killed my sister.

01:24:34.657 --> 01:24:36.093
Your sister?

01:24:37.027 --> 01:24:38.693
Cara.

01:24:38.695 --> 01:24:42.467
<i>She was eight years older than me
living in an apartment on Sunset.</i>

01:24:46.436 --> 01:24:49.439
Oh, the girl with the coffin.

01:24:51.741 --> 01:24:53.210
Until you ended her.

01:24:54.644 --> 01:24:56.410
She wanted to die.

01:24:56.412 --> 01:24:59.547
I simply put her out
of her misery.

01:24:59.549 --> 01:25:01.651
Just like
I'm about to do to you.

01:25:04.787 --> 01:25:06.156
Oh, yeah?

01:25:06.756 --> 01:25:07.858
Bite me, bitch.

01:25:08.692 --> 01:25:10.194
That's the idea.

01:25:17.968 --> 01:25:19.967
This is for my sister.

01:25:19.969 --> 01:25:23.140
My own invention
of barbed wire rope.

01:25:44.393 --> 01:25:46.229
Now the world
will finally know.

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:56.307
