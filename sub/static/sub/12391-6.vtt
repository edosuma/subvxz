WEBVTT

00:03.430 --> 00:05.068
[banging noises]

00:08.700 --> 00:10.406
[clattering]

00:14.610 --> 00:15.702
GOOD MORNING, DAD.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.048
I MADE YOU SOME
OF YOUR FAVORITE

00:17.080 --> 00:18.604
BANANA NUT MUFFINS.
OH, YEAH?

00:18.650 --> 00:21.141
TRYING TO GET UN-GROUNDED BEFORE
ROBOCOP COMES OUT ON FRIDAY?

00:21.180 --> 00:22.078
[chuckles]

00:22.120 --> 00:24.748
DID I MENTION I MADE THEM
ALL BY MYSELF?

00:24.790 --> 00:26.712
MM, NOT BAD.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.821
WHAT RECIPE DID YOU USE?
MY RECIPE?

00:30.860 --> 00:32.828
UH, I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.293
UM, IT'S A SECRET.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.627
WELL, LET ME SEE
IF I CAN GUESS

00:35.660 --> 00:37.298
SOME OF THE INGREDIENTS
THAT YOU PUT IN HERE.

00:37.330 --> 00:40.367
IS THAT A HINT OF CINNAMON
THAT I'M TASTING?

00:40.400 --> 00:42.402
OH, YEAH, JUST A LITTLE.
MM-HMM.

00:42.440 --> 00:47.503
AND I'M DETECTING JUST A TOUCH
OF CILANTRO AND [smacking lips]

00:47.540 --> 00:49.144
THYM E--AM I RIGHT?

00:49.180 --> 00:50.704
WHOA, DAD,
YOU'RE REALLY SHARP.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.615
YEAH, I AM.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.448
GUS, YOU WANT TO COME OUT
OF THE PANTRY?

01:02.790 --> 01:04.678
[sighs]
SHAWN, WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU
1,000 TIMES BEFORE?

01:04.730 --> 01:07.119
DON'T HIDE GUS
IN THE PANTRY?

01:07.160 --> 01:08.388
NO!

01:08.430 --> 01:10.591
A LIE ALWAYS LEADS
TO MORE LIES.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.190
INSTEAD OF LYING TO ME
ABOUT BAKING THESE YOURSELF,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.662
AND THEN LYING TO ME
ABOUT YOUR SECRET INGREDIENTS

01:14.700 --> 01:15.792
THAT YOU PUT IN,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.661
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID
THAT GUS BAKED THESE MUFFINS,

01:18.710 --> 01:20.109
AND I MIGHT HAVE LET YOU
OFF THE HOOK.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.778
WHO SAID GUS MADE THEM?

01:21.810 --> 01:22.777
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

01:22.810 --> 01:23.845
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT IS.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.609
SHAWN...
WHO'S SHAWN?

01:32.520 --> 01:34.715
PUBLIC PARKING, HUH?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.456
NICE TO KNOW THAT
MY FIRST VISIT TO SANTA BARBARA

01:37.490 --> 01:38.479
ISN'T A GOOD ENOUGH REASON
FOR YOU

01:38.530 --> 01:40.748
TO POP FOR A COUPLE
OF EXTRA BUCKS FOR THE VALET.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.223
THE RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE
VALET PARKING, UNCLE BURTON.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.295
AM I GONNA NEED TOKENS
TO USE THE BATHROOM?

01:45.330 --> 01:47.298
IT'S BEEN WELL REVIEWED--
IT GOT FOUR SPOONS.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.137
CRACK SPOONS,
FROM THE SOUND OF IT.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.364
GUS, WAIT UP.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.604
SHAWN?

01:51.640 --> 01:52.777
FINALLY.

01:52.810 --> 01:55.176
YOU KNOW, I WENT
TO TWO COMIC BOOK STORES

01:55.210 --> 01:56.302
AND TH REE WOMEN'S
VOLLEYBALL GAMES

01:56.350 --> 01:57.499
LOOKING FOR YOU.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.245
LUCKILY YOUR PHONE HAS GPS.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.247
YOU TRACKED ME?

02:00.280 --> 02:01.372
YES, I DID.

02:01.420 --> 02:02.409
WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM MY FRIENDS

02:02.450 --> 02:03.644
AT YOUR WIRELESS
SERVICE PROVIDER.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.544
BY THE WAY,
THEY MIGHT BE CALLING.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.751
THEY THINK YOU'RE A FUGITIVE
FROM JUSTICE.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.655
RUN WITH IT.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.385
WHO IS THIS, BURTON?
SHAWN SPENCER.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.749
HE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE,
HE KNOWS WHAT YOU DO.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.290
DON'T SPEAK.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.695
WE'RE GOING TO DINNER.
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

02:15.730 --> 02:16.890
LET'S ROLL,
UNCLE BURTON.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.535
UH, JULES JUST CALLED--
WE'VE GOT A CASE.

02:19.570 --> 02:20.662
(Shawn)
WE SHOULD GO.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.598
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,

02:21.640 --> 02:23.835
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HANDLE THIS ONE YOURSELF.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.508
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

02:25.540 --> 02:27.838
FIRST TIME FOR--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:27.880 --> 02:31.873
SORRY, SHAWN,
I CAN'T MAKE IT.

02:31.910 --> 02:32.877
(Uncle Burton)
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
BURTON,

02:32.920 --> 02:34.342
THE COPS ARE
HANDING YOU A CASE.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.415
YOU'VE GO'I'I'A TAKE IT.

02:35.450 --> 02:36.712
YOU'RE THE ONLY
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

02:36.750 --> 02:37.887
TH EY'VE GOT.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.354
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
DON'T SPEAK.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.414
JUST ONE MINUTE.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.688
OKAY.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.651
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

02:43.690 --> 02:46.295
OF COURSE YOU DO,
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.627
A FEW MONTHS AGO
I WAS ON THE PHONE

02:47.660 --> 02:49.423
WITH MY GREAT AUNT,
WHO'S HARD OF HEARING,

02:49.470 --> 02:50.721
AND PRETI'Y MUCH OUT OF IT
IN GENERAL.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.466
I TOLD HER I WAS WORKING
PART-TIME

02:53.500 --> 02:55.661
AT A PSYCHIC
DETECTIVE AGENCY.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.839
SHE MUST'VE MISUNDERSTOOD
BECAUSE NOW EVERYBODY

02:57.870 --> 02:59.371
ON MY MOM'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY THINKS

02:59.410 --> 03:01.275
[whispering]
THAT I'M A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE...

03:01.310 --> 03:03.540
AND YOU'RE...
GAY.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.569
NO.
GERMAN?
NO.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.441
INVISIBLE.
MY ASSISTANT, SHAWN.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.617
WOW.

03:07.650 --> 03:09.618
GUS, THIS IS, UH...

03:09.650 --> 03:11.288
WOW!
I KNOW.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.480
IT'S A MESS.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.613
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HIM IT
WAS A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING?

03:14.660 --> 03:15.957
IT'S TOO LATE.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.582
I CAN'T COME CLEAN NOW
WITHOUT EVERYONE THINKING

03:17.630 --> 03:19.393
THAT I LIED TO THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.455
PLUS, UNCLE BURTON HAS
HAD IT OUT FOR ME

03:21.500 --> 03:23.388
EVER SINCE HE STARTED
GOING BY "GUS,"

03:23.430 --> 03:24.761
EVEN THOUGH
I'M NAMES AFTER HIM.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.893
IF HE FIGURES OUT
THAT I'M NOT PSYCHIC,

03:26.940 --> 03:27.964
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT HIS MISSION
TO DESTROY ME

03:28.000 --> 03:29.308
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.159
ALL RIGHT, SAY NO MORE.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.269
YOU'RE NOT GETTING DESTROYED
BY THAT MAN.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.402
(Uncle Burton)
I'M GETTING HUNGRY
OVER HERE.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.931
DON'T WORRY,
I HAVE A PLAN.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.642
UNCLE BURTON.
HMM?

03:38.680 --> 03:41.774
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME WITH US,

03:41.820 --> 03:44.414
AND WATCH YOUR NEPHEW
IN ACTION?

03:44.450 --> 03:46.554
TAG ALONG WITH YOU GUYS
ON A REAL DETECTIVE CASE?

03:46.590 --> 03:47.818
YEAH.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.815
HEY, MAYBE THIS WON'T BE

03:48.860 --> 03:51.328
THE MOST BORING VACATION
IN THE WORLD AFI'ER ALL.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.622
[chuckles]
MAYBE.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.960
I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH YOU WORK
YOUR PSYCHIC MAGIC.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.562
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:02.610 --> 04:03.463
*

04:03.510 --> 04:05.000
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:05.040 --> 04:07.031
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

04:07.080 --> 04:08.479
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:08.510 --> 04:10.046
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:10.080 --> 04:11.570
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:11.610 --> 04:13.475
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:13.520 --> 04:15.408
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:15.450 --> 04:17.543
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

04:17.590 --> 04:19.581
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

04:26.930 --> 04:28.557
(Shawn)
SO, HOW YOU FEELING, BUDDY?

04:28.600 --> 04:29.828
A LITTLE NERVOUS?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.462
FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING
IN THE BELLY?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.058
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO
SOME OF YOUR LAMAZE BREATHING.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.637
NO, YOU KNOW WHY, SHAWN?

04:35.670 --> 04:36.898
BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE PLAN
TO EMBARRASS ME

04:36.940 --> 04:37.964
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

04:38.010 --> 04:38.704
AS SOON AS THE COPS SEE
UNCLE BURTON HANGING AROUND,

04:38.740 --> 04:40.628
THEY'RE GONNA KICK HIM
RIGHT OUT.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.443
NICE TRY, SHAWNY BOY.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.947
HEY, GUYS.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.447
AH, BUZZ.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.970
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE
THEY'RE GONNA WANT YOU

04:47.020 --> 04:48.510
HAVING ANY GUESTS
IN HERE.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.711
I MEAN, SINCE IT'S
A CRIME SCENE AND ALL.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.581
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S NOT?

04:52.620 --> 04:53.712
NO.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.614
THERE'S NO CRIME-SCENE TAPE
AT THE DOOR,

04:55.660 --> 04:58.959
THE FORENSIC GUYS ARE NOT
COLLECTING ANY EVIDENCE,

04:58.990 --> 05:00.628
AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU GUYS
DON'T SUSPECT FOUL PLAY,

05:00.660 --> 05:02.719
SO I'VE GOT AS MUCH RIGHT
TO BE HERE AS YOU DO.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.796
AND DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THAT
FANCY POLICE TALK, PLEASE.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.060
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH
HILL STREET BLUES

05:08.100 --> 05:10.568
TO KNOW WHAT'S WHAT.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.339
I GOTTA GO.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.507
MMM.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.849
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING
SO QUICK.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.745
WHO'S THIS?

05:18.780 --> 05:20.543
THIS IS MY UNCLE BURTON,
FROM NEW JERSEY.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.808
SHAWN INVITED HIM.

05:21.850 --> 05:24.444
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU,
UNCLE...BURTON?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.082
HIS MOTHER NAMED HIM
AFTER ME.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.815
IT'S NOT
A VERY COMMON NAME,

05:27.860 --> 05:30.420
BUT SOME OF US STILL
USE IT PROUDLY.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.099
JULES, WHAT'S THE SKINNY?
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:33.130 --> 05:35.997
VINCE WAGNER,
LONGTIME RESTAURANT CRITIC

05:36.030 --> 05:37.019
AT THE SANTA BARBARA MIRROR,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.937
DIED SUDDENLY AFTER EATING
HIS WIFE'S CHICKEN SOUP.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.063
ALL SIGNS POINT
TO NATURAL CAUSES,

05:42.100 --> 05:45.001
BUT THE WIFE'S ACTING
A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.439
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING,

05:46.480 --> 05:47.777
SO I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO GET A READING ON HER.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.949
THEN THAT'S WHAT
WE WILL DO.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.049
SHE'S IN THE DEN.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.919
FINALLY A CHANCE TO SEE
GUS' PSYCHIC POWERS AT WORK.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.781
SHAWN, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

05:58.820 --> 06:00.685
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE?

06:00.720 --> 06:02.483
STOP PLAYING, SHAWN--
YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THIS!

06:02.530 --> 06:03.952
YES, YOU CAN.
NO, I CAN'T.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.878
YOU MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS,
YOU FORM A CONCLUSION,

06:05.930 --> 06:06.794
AND YOU REVEAL IT
TO EVERYBODY

06:06.830 --> 06:07.899
IN A RIDICULOUS
AND/OR ROUNDABOUT WAY.

06:07.930 --> 06:08.999
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:09.030 --> 06:10.861
I'LL SHOW YOU.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.869
UH-HUH...YEP.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.868
OH!

06:21.880 --> 06:23.905
RAW CHICKEN NEXT TO VEGETABLES,
CHARRED POTS,

06:23.950 --> 06:26.009
AND A REFRIGERATOR
FULL OF TAKE-OUT CONTAINERS.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.176
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU
ABOUT THE WIFE?

06:27.220 --> 06:30.189
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SUCKS AT COOKING.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.744
OH, YOU'RE ON FIRE.
WHAT?

06:31.790 --> 06:33.485
UNCLE BURTON, COME QUICK--
IT'S HAPPENING!

06:33.520 --> 06:34.885
SHAWN, STOP IT.
STOP PLAYING!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.057
PUT YOUR HAND
TO YOUR HEAD.

06:36.090 --> 06:38.422
IT REALLY HELPS SELL
THE THING.
I'M NOT DOING IT, SHAWN.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.098
THIS BETTER BE WORTH
SKIPPING DINNER FOR.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.688
HE'S A PSYCHIC
WILDEBEEST.

06:41.730 --> 06:46.838
I'M--I'M SEEING SOMETHING.

06:49.070 --> 06:50.628
I'M SENSING SOMETHING.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.936
I'M TASTING SOMETHING.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.699
[distasteful grunts]

06:57.750 --> 07:00.446
IT TASTES BAD.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.777
SHE'S A BAD COOK!

07:01.820 --> 07:04.983
(woman)
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE
MY HUSBAND.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.011
MRS. WAGNER?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.914
OH, PLEASE,
EXCUSE MY PARTNER.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.054
HIS PSYCHIC VISIONS ARE OFTEN
TERRIBLY IMPOLITE.

07:12.090 --> 07:14.194
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

07:14.230 --> 07:17.859
I REALLY AM
A TERRIBLE COOK.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.936
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

07:19.970 --> 07:24.998
I'M SENSING THAT YOU'RE AT PEACE
WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S PASSING.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.076
WELL, NOT EXACTLY
AT PEACE.

07:27.110 --> 07:30.602
BUT IT WASN'T EASY BEING MARRIED
TO A FOOD CRITIC.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.140
HE GRADED
EVERYTHING I DID.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.842
SURELY HE COULDN'T HAVE
GRADED EVERYTHING.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.113
I NEVER BROKE TWO STARS.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.659
WELL, THAT'S...
AWFULLY HARSH.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.657
SO WHY DID YOU
KEEP ON COOKING FOR HIM?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.099
HEALTH REASONS.

07:49.130 --> 07:50.620
HE HAD GOTTEN
A WORRISOME CHECKUP

07:50.670 --> 07:52.262
FROM HIS DOCTOR RECENTLY,

07:52.300 --> 07:55.929
HE ATE OUT EVERY DAY
FOR HIS JOB,

07:55.970 --> 07:57.039
AND ALWAYS BROUGHT
THE LEFTOVERS HOME,

07:57.070 --> 07:59.834
SO I STARTED MAKING HIM
HEALTHY, HOME-COOKED MEALS

07:59.880 --> 08:01.677
JUST ONCE A WEEK.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.076
THAT'S WHAT DINNER WAS TONIGHT.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.078
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MRS. WAGNER.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.919
YOU HAVE OUR CONDOLENCES.

08:10.020 --> 08:10.987
SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

08:11.020 --> 08:12.089
IF SHE WANTED HIM DEAD,

08:12.120 --> 08:13.781
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE COOKED HIM
HEALTHY MEALS ONCE A WEEK.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.788
GREAT, LET'S JUST
TELL THE POLICE,

08:15.820 --> 08:16.650
AND GET UNCLE BURTON
OUT OF HERE

08:16.690 --> 08:19.158
BEFORE THEY ASK US
ANYTHING ELSE.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.208
(Shawn)
CHECK IT OUT.

08:33.040 --> 08:36.203
I WENT TO CANDY EMPORIUM,
THIS TIME FOR RESEARCH.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.915
THERE ARE OVER 100 FLAVORS
OF LOLLIPOP ON THE MARKET,

08:39.950 --> 08:41.838
NOT ONE OF WHICH
TURNS YOUR TONGUE BLACK.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.847
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

08:42.890 --> 08:44.039
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:44.090 --> 08:45.011
RIGHT BEFORE WE LEFT,

08:45.050 --> 08:47.109
I CAUGHT A QUICK GLIMPSE
OF THE CRITIC'S MOUTH.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.889
HIS TONGUE WAS COATED BLACK.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.627
NOW, WHAT ELSE COULD POSSIBLY
CAUSE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

08:51.660 --> 08:53.924
BISMUTH SUBSALICYLATE.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.825
THAT DUDE THAT USED TO PLAY
FOR THE MAVERICKS?

08:55.860 --> 08:57.964
NO, SHAWN,
IT'S THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT

08:58.000 --> 08:59.024
IN THOSE PINK
STOMACH MEDICATIONS.

08:59.070 --> 09:00.731
HE MUST'VE HAD SOME.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.169
[toilet flushes]
LOOK, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.906
MY UNCLE IS--
GUS.
WHAT?

09:03.940 --> 09:05.202
THE CRITIC WAS MURDERED.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.936
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE WIFE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.038
SHE DIDN'T.
[Uncle Burton mumbling]

09:09.080 --> 09:11.139
HE WAS COMPLAINING OF
AN UPSET STOMACH BEFORE DINNER.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.738
HE ASKED FOR CHICKEN SOUP.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.714
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE
"I'M FEELING SICK" MEAL.

09:14.750 --> 09:15.876
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
FOR A TUB OF BACON GREASE

09:15.920 --> 09:17.114
AND HOTDOG WATER.

09:17.150 --> 09:20.187
BUT USUALLY--
SHAWN, THIS PLACE IS A STY.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.620
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TIDY UP
ONCE IN A WHILE, HUH?

09:22.660 --> 09:24.184
OR DID YOU FORGET
THAT YOU'RE THE ASSISTANT?

09:24.230 --> 09:27.722
YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, SIR.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.228
THE PERSON WHO'S NOT
THE PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

09:30.270 --> 09:32.226
SHOULD BE IN CHARGE
OF ALL THE CLEANING.

09:32.270 --> 09:33.191
IT JUST MAKES SENSE.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.095
MEANWHILE, GUS HERE
HAS NEW PSYCHIC KNOWLEDGE

09:36.140 --> 09:37.107
ABOUT YESTERDAY'S CASE.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.233
YEAH?
NO, I DON'T, SHAWN.

09:39.270 --> 09:42.103
I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T SPENT
SO MUCH TIME WORKING

09:42.140 --> 09:43.072
WHEN I'VE GOT FAMILY IN TOWN.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.873
OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
BURTON.

09:44.910 --> 09:47.174
YOU THINK DIAGNOSIS MURDER
EVER LET FAMILY GET IN THE WAY

09:47.220 --> 09:48.175
OF HIS WORK?

09:48.220 --> 09:49.812
ANOTHER EXCELLENT POINT.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.239
I BET DIAGNOSIS MURDER
NEVER DID THAT.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.758
GO AHEAD, GUS,
CALL UPON THE SPIRITS.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.655
ASK THEM WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE DEAD CRITIC.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.851
FINE.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.258
[sniffing]

10:05.900 --> 10:09.267
(chanting)
* OH, SPIRITS

10:09.300 --> 10:14.078
* ALWAYS WILLING TO LEND
A HELPING HAND *

10:14.110 --> 10:16.840
THIS PSYCHIC STUFF CAN GET
A LITTLE WIMPY, HUH?

10:16.880 --> 10:20.668
AT LEAST HE'S NOT DOING IT
IN THE TUTU AND CAPEZIOS.

10:20.720 --> 10:25.111
I ASKED YOU TO HELP ME SOLVE
THE MURDER OF VINCE WAGNER.

10:25.150 --> 10:28.278
SHOW ME WHAT TRANSPIRED.

10:31.860 --> 10:32.952
I'M SEEING SOMETHING.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.992
YEAH?

10:36.030 --> 10:38.089
I'M SEEING--

10:38.130 --> 10:40.735
I'M SEEING--

10:40.770 --> 10:44.137
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SEEING.

10:44.170 --> 10:45.660
WAIT, WAIT.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.679
[whispering]
IT'S COMING CLEARER NOW.

10:48.710 --> 10:52.840
SOMEBODY PUT SOMETHING
IN HIS FOOD...

10:52.880 --> 10:54.347
AT A RESTAURANT.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.238
AND THAT IS
WHAT MADE HIM SICK.

10:59.290 --> 11:04.057
SICK TO THE POINT
OF HAVING A SEIZURE.

11:04.090 --> 11:05.057
[mouths words silently]

11:05.090 --> 11:06.182
NO, NO, NO.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.024
THAT'S WHAT KILLED--

11:12.070 --> 11:14.163
THAT'S WHAT KILLED HIS NOSE.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.189
WHAT?

11:17.340 --> 11:19.205
THAT'S WHAT KILLED HIM.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.037
WHOO, GUS!

11:21.080 --> 11:23.344
YOU ARE SO AMAZING
WITH THAT STUFF.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.369
HEH.
THANK YOU.

11:24.410 --> 11:25.946
IF IT WASN'T FOR
HIS PSYCHIC TALENTS,

11:25.980 --> 11:27.345
I'D HAVE TO GET
SOME LAME JOB

11:27.380 --> 11:29.348
AT A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY
OR SOMETHING.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.348
THAT HAPPENS TO BE A VERY
EXCITING INDUSTRY, SHAWN.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.312
NOW LET'S GO AND TELL THE POLICE
OUR NEW REVELATION.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.384
UNCLE BURTON, WAIT HERE.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.819
NO WAY.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.088
IF I WANTED TO SIT ALONE
IN A DIRTY ROOM,

11:37.130 --> 11:38.324
I'D HAVE STAYED AT HOME
WITH MY WIFE.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.090
[chuckles]
I'M GOING WITH YOU GUYS.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.098
KILLED HIS NOSE?!

11:45.130 --> 11:46.324
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID!
WHAT'S WRONG?

11:46.370 --> 11:47.997
YOU WENT LIKE THIS.
HOW DO YOU KILL A NOSE?!

11:52.810 --> 11:55.278
SHAWN, THAT VISITOR'S BADGE IS
NOT GONNA HOLD HIM UP FOR LONG.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.346
I CAN'T BE PSYCHIC
IN FRONT OF THE COPS.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.347
DON'T WORRY,
I HAVE A PLAN.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.177
I'M GONNA GO IN VICK'S OFFICE,
YOU WAIT HERE.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.244
FOR WHAT?
MY SIGNAL.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.386
THE STUFF YOU DID IN THE OFFICE,
GENIUS, ALL OF IT.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.308
BUT I WANTED YOU
TO SAY "POISON," GUS.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.749
POISON.
GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.087
THIS TIME?
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT TO--

12:09.120 --> 12:10.985
[whispering harshly]
THERE'S NO TIME TO EXPLAIN!

12:11.030 --> 12:12.850
[loudly]
HAM PENCILS!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.424
SHEILA E. TOMATO BARK!

12:14.460 --> 12:16.098
VELVETY SHARK TOAST--

12:16.130 --> 12:18.291
SHARK TOAST!

12:18.330 --> 12:20.389
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU, MR. SPENCER?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.806
YOU PICKED TODAY
TO ASK HIM THAT QUESTION?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.535
DUDE, LASSIE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ARM?

12:24.570 --> 12:26.003
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:26.040 --> 12:26.904
HE WON'T TELL US EITHER.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.237
AND WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
WHEN YOU CAME IN?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.907
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
ANY OF IT.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.269
OH, JULES, IT'S THIS CASE.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.914
THESE VISIONS I'M HAVING,
THEY'RE SO INTENSE,

12:32.950 --> 12:34.247
I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE THEM.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.283
EVERY TIME I OPEN MY MOUTH,
THE WRONG FISHES COME OUT!

12:37.320 --> 12:39.311
YOU MEAN "WORDS"?
ISN'T THAT WHAT I SAID?

12:39.350 --> 12:40.317
OH, NO.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.112
IF ONLY THERE WERE
SOMEONE HERE

12:42.160 --> 12:42.979
THAT COULD TRANSLATE.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.349
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO'S
KNOWN ME SO LONG

12:44.390 --> 12:45.357
THEY UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING I SAY.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.156
SOMEONE JUST SLIGHTLY
LESS HANDSOME THAN I AM.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.193
GUS!
PERFECT --THIS IS PERFECT.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.367
GUS, GUS, GET IN HERE.
WHAT?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.539
(SHAWN)
OH, MAMBO BEEF PUDDLES!

12:55.570 --> 12:58.334
SWIRLY-WHIRLY JUNGLE PANTS!

12:58.370 --> 13:01.373
QUICK, TRANSLATE THAT
INTO NORMAL WORDS FOR US.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.105
MAN, THEY MADE ME
FILL THIS THING OUT

13:03.150 --> 13:04.299
FOR SIX PAGES
OF PAPER WORK,

13:04.350 --> 13:05.544
AND THEY DIDN'T PUT
MY PICTURE ON IT.

13:05.580 --> 13:06.547
SORRY, WHO ARE YOU?

13:06.580 --> 13:08.070
DON'T ASK
ANYMORE QUESTIONS.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.417
NO ONE.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.111
CONCENTRATE, GUS.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.412
TELL US THAT
ALL THIS MEANS.

13:12.450 --> 13:17.126
SWIRLY-WHIRLY JUNGLE PANTS.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.924
IT MEANS THE CRITIC
ATE SOMETHING

13:19.960 --> 13:22.019
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.220
TWO BONES AND A SKULL.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.999
TWO BONES AND A SKU--
POISON.

13:25.030 --> 13:27.362
YES, THE CRITIC
WAS POISONED.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.302
MAN, THIS IS BETTER
THAN GHOST WHISPERERS.

13:31.340 --> 13:32.329
GUYS, WE CHECKED
THE WIFE'S SOUP.

13:32.370 --> 13:33.473
IT'S CLEAN.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.307
AND AM I NOW SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT GUSTER HERE--

13:35.340 --> 13:37.069
CARNIVAL STUD MUFFIN--HUH?
WHAT?

13:37.110 --> 13:38.839
IT WASN'T THE WIFE.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.372
THE CRITIC WAS POISONED
AT A RESTAURANT.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.082
(Shawn)
NOW, THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.314
WAGNER WAS PRETTY HARSH
ON HIS OWN WIFE'S COOKING.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.614
HE WAS PROBABLY EVEN HARDER
ON THE RESTAURANTS HE REVIEWED.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.026
HE COULD HAVE EASILY
BEEN POISONED BY A CHEF

13:51.060 --> 13:52.584
WHO GOT A BAD REVIEW.
MM-HMM.

13:52.630 --> 13:53.892
DO YOU THINK SO?

13:53.930 --> 13:54.999
r569
,{gf§;i

13:55.030 --> 13:57.624
OKAY...

13:57.670 --> 13:58.466
CALL THE LAB.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.491
I WANT A TOX REPORT
ON MY DESK ASAP.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.132
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
LISTENING TO THIS?

14:02.170 --> 14:05.207
WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN INFORMATION
IN STRANGER WAYS BEFORE.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.299
NEVER HURTS
TO CHECK IT OUT.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.501
BURTON, THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.007
HOW DO YOU DO THAT STUFF?

14:11.050 --> 14:12.972
HE CAN'T TALK TIGHT NOW,
UNCLE BURTON.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.443
PSYCHIC EPISODES LIKE THAT
LEAVE HIM VERY, VERY PARCHED.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.344
[straining]
A LITTLE PARCHED--

14:16.380 --> 14:18.211
NO, NO, NO, LET ME
GET YOU SOME WATER.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.478
DOWN THOSE STAIRS,
AROUND THE CORNER.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.612
[raspy voice]
THANK YOU.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.355
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

14:22.390 --> 14:24.449
WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHAT THAT CRITIC ATE.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.422
IF HE WAS POISONED
BY A CHEF,

14:25.460 --> 14:26.324
IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING HE CONSUMED

14:26.360 --> 14:28.396
IN THE 24 HOURS
LEADING UP TO HIS DEATH.

14:28.430 --> 14:29.397
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

14:29.430 --> 14:30.397
WELL,
WAGNER'S WIFE SAID,

14:30.430 --> 14:31.567
HE BROUGHT ALL
OF HIS LEFTOVERS HOME, RIGHT?

14:31.600 --> 14:34.535
THE REFRIGERATOR WAS PACKED
WITH TAKE-OUT CONTAINERS.

14:34.570 --> 14:37.403
THE ONE ON TOP WAS PROBABLY
THE MOST RECENT.

14:37.440 --> 14:41.228
THE RESTAURANT
IT CAME FROM WAS...

14:45.210 --> 14:46.507
THE CURW A.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.211
"THE CURW A"?

14:48.250 --> 14:50.343
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
A PLACE THAT SERVES FOOD, SHAWN.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.948
IT'S NOT THE NAME, IT'S
THE SYMBOL ON TOP OF THE BOX.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.389
COME ON, MAN, YOU EAT OUT
ALL THE TIME.

14:53.420 --> 14:56.150
WHAT PLACE HAS A BIG,
SWOOPY, CURVING A?

14:56.190 --> 14:57.259
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.489
ANTONIO'S.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.464
SWEET!

15:07.500 --> 15:08.296
WHY DID YOU WRITE
ON MY HAND?!

15:08.340 --> 15:09.090
WHY WOULD I WRITE
ON MY OWN HAND?

15:09.140 --> 15:11.005
THIS THING IS
TOTALLY PERMANENT.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.337
WHA--SHAWN!

15:15.240 --> 15:16.036
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK

15:16.080 --> 15:17.308
BEFORE UNCLE BURTON
STARTS THINKING

15:17.350 --> 15:18.271
OF STICKING 'EM
WITH THE CHECK.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.346
(man)
FIRE UP THE ENTREES
FOR THE EIGHT-TOP.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.972
MARIO, WHERE ARE
MY STARTERS?

15:22.020 --> 15:22.987
HURRY UP!

15:23.020 --> 15:25.409
HEY, CHEF ANTONIO.

15:25.450 --> 15:27.589
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.952
SORRY, GUYS, NO CUSTOMERS
ALLOWED IN THE KITCHEN, OKAY?

15:29.990 --> 15:31.150
[Antonio speaks Italian]
(GUS)
NO, WE'RE NOT CUSTOMERS.

15:31.190 --> 15:32.589
WE'RE FROM THE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT,

15:32.630 --> 15:34.120
HERE FOR A SURPRISE
INSPECTION.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.299
AGAIN?

15:36.330 --> 15:37.558
WE JUST HAD
THE SURPRISE INSPECTION

15:37.600 --> 15:38.589
A FEW DAYS AGO.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.359
WHY, IS THERE A PROBLEM?
YES.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.108
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.008
(Antonio)
WALLS AND THE FLOOR ARE CLEAN.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.577
DRAINAGE IS CLEAR.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.101
HAND WASHING STATION
IS STOCKED WITH SOAP

15:52.150 --> 15:53.674
AND CLEAN TOWELS.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.540
DRY FOOD STORAGE
OVER THERE,

15:55.580 --> 15:59.016
WALK-IN FREEZER
OVER HERE.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.519
LOOKS GOOD.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.721
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO CHECK
THE TEMPERATURE?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.057
OF COURSE.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.727
GUS, GO AHEAD,
CHECK THE TEMPERATURE.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.569
ME? WHY DO I HAVE
TO DO IT?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.137
DUDE, I'M WEARING
SHORT SLEEVES.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.760
SO DID YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE FOOD CRITIC

16:17.810 --> 16:18.765
DOWN AT THE MIRROR?

16:18.810 --> 16:20.607
THAT'S SOME NASTY BUSINESS,
HUH?

16:20.640 --> 16:22.733
SURE, I HEARD
ABOUT WAGNER.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.600
I DON'T SAY I'M SAD.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.379
TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN WORKING
IN THIS TOWN,

16:26.410 --> 16:28.571
THAT MAN NEVER GAVE MY FOOD
A GOOD REVIEW.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.575
(Gus)
OOH, IT'S COLD!

16:29.620 --> 16:31.485
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT
VERY FOND OF THE GUY.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.648
VINCE WAGNER
MADE MY LIFE MISERABLE

16:34.690 --> 16:36.487
WITH HIS ASININE REVIEWS.

16:36.520 --> 16:41.025
HONESTLY, I AM GLAD THAT
THAT BASTARD IS DEAD!

16:41.060 --> 16:43.699
(McNab)
CHEF ANTONIO!

16:43.730 --> 16:46.699
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF VINCE WAGNER.

16:46.730 --> 16:49.164
TAKE HIM.
MURDER?

16:49.200 --> 16:51.634
IS THISI A JOKE?

16:51.670 --> 16:52.659
WHO PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

16:52.710 --> 16:54.530
JULES, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.571
TOX SCREEN
CAME BACK POSITIVE.

16:56.610 --> 16:58.248
APPARENTLY WAGNER ATE
A POISONOUS MUSHROOM

16:58.280 --> 16:59.474
CALLED THE "DEATH CAP."

16:59.510 --> 17:00.442
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.072
THERE WERE DEATH CAPS
IN THE MUSHROOM RISOTTO

17:02.120 --> 17:03.747
WAGNER ATE HERE
THE DAY BEFORE HE DIED.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.588
WE FOUND THE LEFTOVERS
IN HIS FRIDGE.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.418
LOOKS LIKE
YOU WERE RIGHT, SHAWN--OR GUS.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.452
OR. . .WHOEVER.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.390
WHAT A RELIEF.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.193
WE CAUGHT THE GUY,
WE SOLVED THE CASE,

17:16.230 --> 17:18.596
AND BEST OF ALL, I DON'T HAVE
TO BE PSYCHIC ANYMORE.

17:18.630 --> 17:22.066
HEH HEH HEH HEH..

17:24.670 --> 17:26.331
UH-OH.

17:26.370 --> 17:27.337
WHAT?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.632
WE GOT THE WRONG GUY.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.671
MAN!

17:39.390 --> 17:41.085
GUYS, IT'S NOT
THAT COMPLICATED.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.781
WHENEVER A CRITIC EATS
AT HIS RESTAURANT,

17:42.820 --> 17:44.424
ANTONIO PREPARES
THE MEAL HIMSELF.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.519
NOT THIS TIME.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.527
THE MUSHROOMS
IN THE TAKE-OUT CONTAINER

17:47.560 --> 17:48.424
WE CUT INTO CUBES.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.360
ANTONIO CUTS HIS MUSHROOMS
INTO STRIPS.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.267
LASSIE, I HAVE A REALLY
STRONG VIBE HE DIDN'T DO THIS.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.439
LOOK, WE KNOW ANTONIO
HATED WAGNER.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.233
WAGNER DIED
FROM EATING HIS RISOTTO.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.362
WE HAVE THE RISOTTO.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.799
WE EVEN HAVE WAGNER'S NOTES
PROVING HE ATE THE RISOTTO.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.068
IT'S A SLAM DUNK.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.184
[whispering]
THAT'S WAGNER'S NOTEBOOK.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.539
IT SAYS THE RISOTTO
WAS COLD.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.841
SO?
SO--

18:15.620 --> 18:17.781
WHOA--THE SANDPAPER
WITH THE BANANA PATCH!

18:17.830 --> 18:19.855
I THINK HE MEANS
THE RISOTTO WAS COLD.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.255
THANK YOU, GUS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.358
WHY WOULD FOOD
BE SERVED COLD

18:22.400 --> 18:24.823
AT A FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT,
UNLESS--

18:24.870 --> 18:27.338
UNLESS THE POISONED FOOD WAS
COOKED SOMEWHERE ELSE?

18:27.370 --> 18:29.759
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

18:29.800 --> 18:31.199
CASE IS CLOSED.

18:34.610 --> 18:36.271
HEY, GUYS.

18:36.310 --> 18:39.177
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
AN INCREDIBLE DAY, BURTON.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.144
YOU'RE A REGULAR
ROCKFORD FILES.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.841
[chuckles]

18:44.950 --> 18:46.918
DID MY UNCLE JUST THANK ME
FOR AN INCREDIBLE DAY?

18:46.950 --> 18:49.418
A MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION,
HOW MUCH TV DOES HE WATCH?

18:49.460 --> 18:50.859
I'M SERIOUS, SHAWN.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.152
MY COUSIN TOOK HIM
TO THE SUPER BOWL

18:52.190 --> 18:53.020
ON A HELICOPTER,

18:53.060 --> 18:54.322
AND HE NEVER EVEN
THANKED HIM FOR THAT.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.349
I'M SERIOUS TOO.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.856
HE'S LIKE THIS CRAZY,

18:56.900 --> 18:59.721
TANK-SHAPED ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF DETECTIVE SHOWS.

18:59.770 --> 19:01.294
I BE HE EVEN SAW
MANIMAL.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.205
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.138
ABOUT MANIMAL?
SHAWN,

19:04.170 --> 19:05.728
WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS CASE
BEFORE HE LEAVES.

19:05.770 --> 19:06.930
WHY?
BECAUSE,

19:06.970 --> 19:07.937
I THINK I'VE FINALLY
FIGURED OUT

19:07.980 --> 19:09.379
HOW TO GET BACK
ON HIS GOOD SIDE.

19:09.410 --> 19:10.809
I'VE BEEN SEEKING
UNCLE BURTON'S APPROVAL

19:10.850 --> 19:11.805
ALL MY LIFE.

19:11.850 --> 19:12.908
HE'S MEAN TO EVERYBODY.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.838
BUT EVER SINCE HE STARTED
TAGGING ALONG ON THIS CASE,

19:14.880 --> 19:15.949
HE'S BEEN KIND OF NICE
TO ME.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.585
YOU KNOW WHY?
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE BRAIDS ANYMORE.

19:18.620 --> 19:19.518
HE LIKES DETECTIVE SHOWS

19:19.550 --> 19:21.450
IF I COULD SOLVE THIS CASE
BEFORE HE LEAVES,

19:21.490 --> 19:23.526
HE MAY FINALLY GET OVER
THE WHOLE "GUS BURTON'l THING.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.187
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.221
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
MR. PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.899
TELL ME, SINCE ANTONIO
CLEARLY DIDN'T KILL THE CRITIC,

19:29.930 --> 19:31.261
WHO DID?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.961
I DON'T KNOW.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.228
MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND OUT

19:34.270 --> 19:35.259
IF ANYONE ELSE HATED HIM.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.335
SEE WHO ELSE MAY HAVE HAD
A MOTIVE.

19:36.370 --> 19:37.906
SHH!
WHAT?

19:37.940 --> 19:39.931
[whispering]
YOU'RE GONNA START
A CRIME-FIGHTING REVOLUTION

19:39.970 --> 19:43.406
WITH TALK LIKE THAT.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.771
SHAWN, YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME!

19:52.020 --> 19:54.386
(Shawn)
PHIL PRITIKIN,
MR. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.853
SHAWN SPENCER--

19:55.890 --> 19:58.984
LONG-TIME READER,
FIRST-TIME CALLER...

19:59.030 --> 20:00.497
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE SUNDAY SPREAD?

20:00.530 --> 20:01.895
LAYOUT'S WAITING
FOR YOUR APPROVAL

20:01.930 --> 20:02.919
ON THE MOCK-UP.

20:02.960 --> 20:03.892
"MOCK-UP," FUNNY WORD.

20:03.930 --> 20:04.919
LIKE I WAS SAYING--

20:04.970 --> 20:06.699
WHERE' SALAZAR'S ALDERMAN STORY?

20:06.730 --> 20:07.731
SHE'S TYPING IT UP.

20:07.770 --> 20:08.862
DO YOU WANT COPY
TO READ IT FIRST?

20:08.900 --> 20:10.436
NO, JUST SEND IT
STRAIGHT HERE.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.801
ANYTHING ELSE?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.376
YOU KNOW, PHIL,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

20:13.410 --> 20:15.378
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE--
DOES HE WORK HERE?

20:15.410 --> 20:16.832
I DON'T BELIEVE SO, SIR.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.847
SON, I'M A BUSY MAN.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.246
IF YOU DON'T WORK FOR ME,
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.918
I JUST HAVE A QUESTION
ABOUT VINCE WAGNER.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.679
COOPER, THESE GUYS
GOT QUESTIONS.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.986
OH, I ALSO HAVE AN IDEA
FOR A CROSSOVER STRIP,

20:28.020 --> 20:31.251
WHERE DILBERT FINALLY
MEETS MARMADUKE.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.929
(man)
DID YOU GUYS NEED SOMETHING?

20:33.960 --> 20:35.621
HI, I'M BURTON GUSTER,

20:35.660 --> 20:36.991
WITH THE SBPD.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.328
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE MURDER OF VINCE WAGNER.

20:39.370 --> 20:40.598
I'M COOPER.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.993
I WAS MR. WAGNER'S
ASSISTANT.
GREAT.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.928
MAYBE YOU COULD
HELP US OUT.

20:43.970 --> 20:45.665
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE
WHO MAY HAVE HAD A GRUDGE

20:45.710 --> 20:46.665
AGAINST YOUR BOSS?

20:46.710 --> 20:48.337
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:48.380 --> 20:51.599
WE CALL THEM
THE ANGRY CHEF LETTERS.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.470
EVERY CHEF WHO EVER GOT
A BAD REVIEW

20:53.520 --> 20:55.272
WOULD WRITE A NASTY LETTER
TO MR. WAGNER ABOUT IT.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.845
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THIS IS ALL HATE MAIL?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.915
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D CALL IT ALL HATE MAIL.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.987
IT RANGES FROM
"MILD DISLIKE" MAIL

21:03.020 --> 21:06.285
TO "EXTREME ABHORRENCE" MAIL.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.297
HOW ABOUT
"I WISH YOU WERE DEAD" MAIL?

21:07.330 --> 21:08.991
OH, WE HAVE THOSE TOO.

21:09.030 --> 21:10.998
BACK HERE.

21:11.030 --> 21:14.295
ANY ONE OF THESE CHEFS COULD
HAVE COOKED THE POISON RISO'ITO

21:14.340 --> 21:15.534
AND SNUCK IT INTO
ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT.

21:15.570 --> 21:16.696
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:16.740 --> 21:17.866
WE SHOULD TALK
TO ALL THESE CHEFS

21:17.910 --> 21:20.037
BEFORE THEY OPEN
FOR BUSINESS.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.571
CALL THE RESTAURANTS
AND MAKE A RESERVATION.

21:21.610 --> 21:22.804
FOR JUSTICE.

21:22.840 --> 21:23.670
IS JUSTICE THE TIME

21:23.710 --> 21:24.847
OR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
IN OUR PARTY?

21:24.880 --> 21:25.949
JUST CALL 'EM.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.072
AND MAKE IT FOR THREE.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.977
UNCLE BURTON'S COMING.
ALL RIGHT.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.885
[Bow Wow Wow's
I Want Candy]

21:31.920 --> 21:33.911
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF VINCE WAGNER?

21:33.960 --> 21:38.329
LOOKY HERE,
HE WAS A JACKASS.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.023
YOU KNOW WHAT HE CALLED
MY AWARD-WINNING JAM BALAYA?

21:42.060 --> 21:44.028
"JUMBA-LOUSY!"

21:44.070 --> 21:47.096
Y'ALL TELL ME IF THIS AIN'T
THE BEST DAMN JAMBALAYA

21:47.130 --> 21:48.734
YOU'VE NEVER HAD
IN YOUR LIFE.

21:48.770 --> 21:54.538
*

21:54.580 --> 21:56.002
YOU KNOW WHAT HE WROTE
IN HIS REVIEW

21:56.040 --> 21:57.007
OF MY FAMOUS
MISO YELLOWTAIL ROLL?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.007
HMM?

21:58.050 --> 21:59.403
"MISO DISAPPOINTED."

21:59.450 --> 22:00.712
[laughter]

22:00.750 --> 22:03.071
DON'T LAUGH.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.087
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.338
(woman)
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.085
HE ONCE REFERRED TO
MY WHITE CHOCOLATE TIRAMISU

22:08.120 --> 22:09.678
AS "ASS CAKE."

22:09.720 --> 22:11.585
OH, NOW THAT JUST
SEEMS MEAN.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.120
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.890
I WAS HERE THAT NIGHT COOKIN'.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.397
HAD A BUNCH OF BIG GROUPS.

22:17.430 --> 22:18.966
NEVER EVEN LEFT
THE KITCHEN.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.366
MM.
MM, YEAH.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.936
I WAS EITHER IN THE KITCHEN

22:22.970 --> 22:24.130
OR OUT HERE
TALKING TO CUSTOMERS.

22:24.170 --> 22:25.364
I OWN THIS PLACE.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.832
I HAVE TO WATCH OVER
EVERYTHING.

22:26.870 --> 22:29.634
EVERY BOWL, EVERY NOODLE,
EVERY CHOPSTICK--

22:29.680 --> 22:30.704
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.638
I DEFINITELY THOUGHT ABOUT IT
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.944
I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT
WHY THAT GUY WAS SO ANGRY.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.813
HE ATE OUT AT FANCY RESTAURANTS
ALL THE TIME FOR FREE,

22:37.850 --> 22:39.147
AND STILL,
ALL HE DID WAS COMPLAIN.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.158
ASK HER
SOME MORE QUESTIONS.

22:41.190 --> 22:43.920
MAYBE SHE'LL GIVE US
SOME COOKIES.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.951
* I WANT CANDY

22:45.990 --> 22:47.992
I'M CONFUSED--
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

22:48.030 --> 22:49.952
WAGNER NEVER EVEN REVIEWED
MY RESTAURANT.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.069
* HEY

22:51.100 --> 22:53.660
OH, MAKE IT RIGHT.
THERE IT IS.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.667
*HEY*

22:54.700 --> 22:57.601
THAT WAS,
WITHOUT QUESTION,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.858
THE TASTIEST DEAD-END
WE HAVE EVER GONE DOWN.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.834
WELL, AT LEAST IT WASN'T
A COMPLETE WASTE OF OUR TIME.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.507
IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE ANY OF THESE CHEFS

23:04.550 --> 23:06.074
WERE WAY TO BUSY
TO MURDER THE CRITIC.

23:06.110 --> 23:08.078
MATLOCK NEVER ATE
THIS GOOD.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.443
I'M GOING BACK TO THE CAR
AN UNBU'ITON MY PANTS.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.185
YOU KNOW,

23:14.220 --> 23:16.950
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT
THAT DESSERT CHEF SAID.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.685
WAGNER GOT TO EAT OUT
AT FANCY RESTAURANTS

23:18.730 --> 23:20.186
EVERY DAY
ON THE NEWSPAPER'S DIME.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.198
IF I WAS HIM,
I'D BE HAPPY.

23:22.230 --> 23:24.460
I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T WANT
TO HAVE THAT JOB?

23:24.500 --> 23:26.559
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.158
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT,
GUS.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.168
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT--
WE WERE WRONG ABOUT THE CHEFS.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.906
MAYBE THIS WASN'T
ABOUT REVENGE AT ALL.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.202
MAYBE THIS WAS ABOUT
SOMEBODY WANTING

23:33.240 --> 23:34.229
THE RESTAURANT CRITIC'S JOB.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.202
SOMEONE WHO WORKS
AT THE NEWSPAPER.
EXACTLY.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.174
WE NEED TO GET DOWN THERE
AND TALK TO THE EDITOR.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.178
WAIT, WAIT, SHAWN,
HE'S NOT GONNA TALK TO US.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.019
HE DOESN'T TALK TO ANYBODY
WHO DOESN'T WORK FOR HIM.

23:42.050 --> 23:45.486
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL
BE A PROBLEM.

24:00.030 --> 24:02.999
OKAY, I THINK
I HAVE SOMETHING HERE.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.201
YOU, SIR, ARE LEFT-HANDED.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.264
YOU HAVE A NEW BABY
AT HOME,

24:06.310 --> 24:10.508
YOU JUST COVERED A STORY
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDWEST,

24:10.550 --> 24:12.802
AND YOU--

24:12.850 --> 24:15.569
YOU JUST REALLY,
REALLY NEED TO PEE.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.609
JUST GO.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.254
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CONVINCED ME.

24:21.290 --> 24:23.258
CONGRATULATIONS,

24:23.290 --> 24:24.757
YOU'RE OUR NEW
ASTROLOGICAL FORECASTER.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.929
NOW GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU'VE GOT A JOB TO DO,

24:26.960 --> 24:28.951
YOU'VE GOT A DEADLINE
TO MEET.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.031
HEY, DUDE.

24:36.070 --> 24:37.037
DID YOU READ
MY HOROSCOPES?

24:37.070 --> 24:38.662
YES.
THEY'RE TERRIBLE.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.132
HOROSCOPES ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE VAGUE,

24:40.170 --> 24:41.933
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN
INTERPRET THEM

24:41.980 --> 24:43.129
TO MEAN
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.704
YOURS ARE ALL
WAY TOO SPECIFIC.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.968
I WROTE THEM WITH
SPECIFIC PEOPLE IN MIND.

24:47.010 --> 24:48.045
"ARIES:

24:48.080 --> 24:51.186
"CALCIUM IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU RIGHT NOW,

24:51.220 --> 24:52.585
"MR. SALT & PEPPER HAIR

24:52.620 --> 24:54.713
"WITH A MAROON CAR.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.820
"THERE MAY ALSO BE A PROMOTION
IN YOUR FUTURE.

24:57.860 --> 25:01.125
TRY WALKING BACKWARDS
THROUGH DOORWAYS FOR GOOD LUCK."

25:01.160 --> 25:02.650
CARLTON, ARE YOU EXPECTING
A PROMOTION?

25:02.700 --> 25:03.928
NO.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.028
COME ON, O'HARA,
DON'T BE SO NAIVE.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.732
IT'S A HOROSCOPE--
IT'S NONSENSE.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.931
(Vick)
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

25:09.970 --> 25:10.959
OF COURSE.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.307
LET'S SEE, WHAT'S MINE?

25:18.350 --> 25:22.241
"LIBRA: YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE
WILL BE WEARING SNEAKERS

25:22.280 --> 25:25.215
AND AN APPLE JACKS TEE SHIRT."

25:25.250 --> 25:26.945
THAT'S KIND OF
A WEIRD DETAIL.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.151
PHIL--HIYA.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.259
WONDERING IF I COULD ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS

25:30.290 --> 25:32.258
ABOUT THIS
RESTAURANT CRITIC JOB.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.827
GREAT, YOU TOO.

25:34.860 --> 25:35.849
I'M SORRY?

25:35.900 --> 25:37.720
EVERYBODY,
FROM THE OMBUDSMAN

25:37.770 --> 25:38.896
TO THE DELIVERY BOY

25:38.930 --> 25:40.761
WANTS TO BE
THE NEW RESTAURANT CRITIC.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.131
I KNOW IT'S
THE CUSHIEST GIG

25:42.170 --> 25:42.966
IN ALL OF JOURNALISM,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.831
BUT I HIRED YOU
TO WRITE HOROSCOPES,

25:44.870 --> 25:46.701
AND THAT'S WHAT
I EXPECT YOU TO DO.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.231
WHOA, PHIL, I THINK
YOU'RE GE'ITING THE WRONG IDEA.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.204
I JUST COULD SENSE
THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY SWAMPED.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.274
I FIGURED
I'D COME ON IN,

25:53.310 --> 25:56.313
OFFER UP MY SOOTHSAYER
SERVICES--

25:56.350 --> 25:58.215
SAYER SERVICES?

25:58.250 --> 25:59.615
SOOTH SERVICES.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.254
SOOTH SERVICES--

26:01.290 --> 26:03.281
TO HELP YOU PICK
THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR THE JOB.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.129
I GUESS YOU ARE
PRETTY SHARP.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.128
APPLICATIONS ARE
OVER THERE.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.320
KEEP IT QUIET THOUGH.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.624
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
WHO WORKS HERE

26:10.670 --> 26:11.864
IS PLAYING
SOME SORT OF ANGLE.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.322
TO GET THE RESTAURANT
CRITIC JOB.

26:13.370 --> 26:14.359
SIR, MEETING IN FIVE.

26:14.400 --> 26:18.700
YOU KNOW, THESE CHEETOS ARE
SO CRISPY, YET AIRY.

26:18.740 --> 26:22.301
AND ITS SUBTLE FLAVOR
IS SUCH A WONDERFUL CONTRAST

26:22.340 --> 26:23.807
TO ITS EYE-CATCHING COLOR.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.045
I GET IT!

26:26.080 --> 26:28.776
(Phil)
EVERY DAY WITH THE CHEETOS.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.788
SHAWN...

26:30.820 --> 26:32.344
THERE IS 100 APPLICATIONS
IN HERE.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.812
THAT'S 100 SUSPECT S.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.282
MY UNCLE'S FLIGHT
LEAVES TODAY.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.117
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK
TO 100 PEOPLE, SHAWN.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.320
WE DON'T NEED TO.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.987
WE JUST NEED TO TALK
TO THE ONE GUY

26:40.030 --> 26:41.054
THAT CAN LINK
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

26:41.100 --> 26:42.055
TO THE MURDER WEAPON.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.089
AND WHO'S THAT?

26:50.000 --> 26:50.967
MM!

26:51.010 --> 26:52.932
MM. . ..
DELICIOUS.

26:52.970 --> 26:57.134
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS GUY?

26:57.180 --> 27:00.877
HE'S THE ONLY MUSHROOM FARMER
IN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.808
IF ANYONE CAN HELP US,
HE CAN.

27:02.850 --> 27:05.318
MR. MOONEY,
THANKS AGAIN

27:05.350 --> 27:08.148
[gargling]
FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO SPEAK WITH US.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.215
AHH.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.353
SO, HOW MANY TYPES
OF MUSHROOMS

27:12.390 --> 27:13.322
DO YOU GROW HERE?

27:13.360 --> 27:15.658
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED,
DEPENDING ON THE SEASON.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.918
DOES THAT INCLUDE A MUSHROOM
CALLED THE "DEATH CAP"?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.995
THE DEATH CAP?

27:20.030 --> 27:21.190
HECK NO, MAN,
THOSE THINGS ARE POISONOUS.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.832
BESIDES, THEY ONLY GROW
IN THE WILD.

27:22.870 --> 27:25.862
WELL, LET'S SAY WE WERE LOOKING
FOR THE DEATH CAP

27:25.910 --> 27:27.104
AROUND HERE.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.038
WHERE WOULD WE FIND IT?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.776
WELL, I KNOW A FEW PLACES
IN THE HILLS.

27:30.810 --> 27:32.107
WHY DO YOU ASK?

27:32.150 --> 27:33.378
WHY DO YOU ASK
WHY DO I ASK?

27:33.410 --> 27:35.116
[laughter]

27:35.150 --> 27:37.880
WHY DO YOU ASK WHY DO I ASK
WHY DO YOU ASK?

27:37.920 --> 27:39.080
WHY DO YOU ASK WHY DO I ASK
WHY DO YOU ASK WHY DO--

27:39.120 --> 27:40.087
SHAWN!

27:40.120 --> 27:42.350
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.255
YEAH, WELL, A GUY CAME IN HERE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

27:44.290 --> 27:46.121
AND HE HAD
THE EXACT SAME QUESTION.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.923
SO YOU REMEMBER
THIS PERSON'S NAME?

27:49.160 --> 27:52.061
BUT I REMEMBER EXACTLY
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.933
CAN YOU GIVE US A DESCRIPTION?
YEAH, OKAY, MAN.

27:54.970 --> 27:57.097
THE GUY WAS ABOUT
NINE-FEET TALL, RIGHT.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.903
HE HAD SUNSHINE
COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH,

27:58.940 --> 28:00.464
AND HE HAD A HIPPOPOTAMUS
FOR A HAND.

28:00.510 --> 28:02.831
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.905
YEP, THAT'LL DO IT.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.770
OKAY, UNCLE BURTON,
JUST LET ME KNOW

28:06.810 --> 28:07.777
WHEN YOU'RE
ALL PACKED UP,

28:07.820 --> 28:09.048
AND I'LL PICK YOU UP AND
TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.115
ALL RIGHT.

28:10.150 --> 28:12.380
WE SPENT TWO HOURS RIDING UP
TO THAT MUSHROOM FARM,

28:12.420 --> 28:13.819
AND WE'RE RIGHT BACK
TO WHERE WE STARTED.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.316
OH...

28:15.360 --> 28:17.112
DON'T BE SUCH
A GLOOMY YOU, GUS.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.229
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.420
NOW WE KNOW THE KILLER
IS A HE.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.291
AND THAT HE HAS
A HIPPOPOTAMUS FOR A HAND?

28:21.330 --> 28:22.820
THAT HELPS US OUT A LOT.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.418
WHOA, DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:24.470 --> 28:25.767
"SAGI'ITARIUS:

28:25.800 --> 28:27.165
"PLEASE RETURN THE BB GUN

28:27.200 --> 28:29.896
"YOU CONFISCATED FROM YOUR SON
IN THE SECOND GRADE.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.965
P.S., YOU ARE
A CRANKY-PANTS."

28:32.010 --> 28:33.307
(Shawn)
THAT'S AN AMAZING
COINCIDENCE.

28:33.340 --> 28:35.205
DIDN'T YOU CONFISCATE
A BB GUN FROM ME

28:35.240 --> 28:36.275
IN THE SECOND GRADE?

28:36.310 --> 28:37.902
LOOK, SHAWN,
HERE'S YOUR STUFF.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.508
NEXT TIME YOU WANT
SOMETHING FROM ME,

28:39.550 --> 28:41.279
BE AN ADULT
AND ASK FOR IT.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.878
PASSING YOURSELF OFF
AS A PSYCHIC,

28:42.920 --> 28:44.046
THAT'S BAD ENOUGH.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.011
BUT HOROSCOPES--
SHAWN, SHAWN!

28:45.050 --> 28:48.178
WHAT IF SOME IDIOT OUT THERE
READS THIS CRAP

28:48.220 --> 28:49.915
AND DECIDES
TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY?

28:49.960 --> 28:53.259
DAD, IT CLEARLY STATES
THAT ASTROLOGICAL FORECASTS

28:53.290 --> 28:54.154
ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT
PURPOSES ONLY.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.293
BESIDES, I ONLY TOOK THE JOB
FOR A CASE.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.992
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE RESTAURANT CRITIC MURDER.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.065
THE COPS ALREADY HAVE
A SUSPECT,

29:00.100 --> 29:02.193
BUT WE'RE PRETTY SURE
THAT CHEF ANTONIO WAS FRAMED.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.266
THEN I ASSUME
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT

29:05.310 --> 29:07.266
THE VEGGIE BURGER
INCIDENT.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.277
[scoffs]

29:08.310 --> 29:09.072
OF COURSE WE KNOW ABOUT

29:09.110 --> 29:10.270
THE VEGGIE BURGER
INCIDENT, DAD.

29:10.310 --> 29:12.301
WE'RE PROFESSIONAL
DETECT IVES.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.817
GUS...
GOOGLING IT.

29:13.850 --> 29:17.115
SHAWN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
INSTEAD OF WASTING YOUR TIME

29:17.150 --> 29:18.515
WRITING THIS GARBAGE
FOR THE NEWSPAPER,

29:18.550 --> 29:20.984
YOU MIGHT TRY READING IT
ONCE IN A WHILE.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.180
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,

29:22.220 --> 29:24.085
VEGETARIAN CUSTOMERS
AT ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT

29:24.130 --> 29:25.882
STARTED COMPLAINING ABOUT
HOW BLAND

29:25.930 --> 29:27.557
THE VEGETARIAN BURGERS WERE.

29:27.590 --> 29:29.922
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION, YOU EAT
A BURGER WITHOUT BEEF IN IT,

29:29.960 --> 29:32.565
(both)
YOU'VE LOST THE RIGHT
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT FLAVOR.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.624
(Shawn)
I'VE HEARD THAT SPEECH
BEFORE.

29:33.670 --> 29:35.968
JUST CALL SOMEONE A HIPPIE
AND GET TO THE POINT.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.309
THE POINT IS ANTONIO DECIDED
TO MAKE THE BURGERS TASTIER

29:38.340 --> 29:40.228
BY ADDING BEEF BROTH
TO THE RECIPE.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.238
OH, GREAT,
ALL THE COMPLAINTS STOPPED,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.874
TILL SOME CRAZED VEGAN LADY--
BY THE NAME OF "DWYER."

29:44.910 --> 29:46.400
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

29:46.450 --> 29:48.338
AND STARTED
ORGANIZING BOYCOTTS

29:48.380 --> 29:50.177
AGAINST ANTONIO'S
RESTAURANT.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.482
THEY'VE BEEN FEUDING
EVER SINCE.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.182
THIS GUY SECRETLY FED BEEF
TO VEGETARIANS?

29:54.220 --> 29:55.255
WHY ARE WE TRYING
TO GET HIM OUT OF JAIL?

29:55.290 --> 29:56.587
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KILL
THE CRITIC.

29:56.620 --> 29:57.848
[snaps fingers]

29:57.890 --> 29:58.959
TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS ARTICLE, SHAWN.

29:58.990 --> 30:00.287
SHE ADVOCATES ANY ACTION

30:00.330 --> 30:01.456
TO PUT CHEF ANTONIO
OUT OF BUSINESS

30:01.500 --> 30:02.558
FOR THE VEGGIE BURGER
INCIDENT.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.262
SHE CALLS HERSELF
THE "VEGAN VIGILANTE.‘l

30:05.300 --> 30:06.824
HUH, HOW VERY VILLAINOUS
OF HER.

30:06.870 --> 30:08.963
YOU THINK SHE COULD'VE
FRAMED ANTONIO

30:09.000 --> 30:09.967
FOR WAGNER'S DEATH
OR WHAT?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.968
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.261
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS DWYER LADY MIGHT BE?

30:13.310 --> 30:15.301
SURE, I SAW HER
AT THE DRIVE-THRU

30:15.340 --> 30:16.307
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.342
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL,
DAD.

30:18.380 --> 30:20.041
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE THERE TODAY?

30:20.080 --> 30:23.413
[shouting]
MEAT IS MURDER!

30:23.450 --> 30:25.315
STOP EATING
YOUR FELLOW CREATURES!

30:25.350 --> 30:29.150
ALL ANIMALS HAVE GOT
THE RIGHT TO LIVE!

30:29.190 --> 30:30.316
MEAT IS MURDER!
[protesters chanting same]

30:30.360 --> 30:31.384
I HATE IT
WHEN MY DAD'S RIGHT.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.318
(Dwyer)
STOP EATING
YOUR FELLOW CREATURES!

30:33.360 --> 30:37.057
ALL ANIMALS HAVE GOT
THE RIGHT TO LIVE.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.159
YO, VEGAN
VIGILANTE LADY.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.565
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN OUT HERE?

30:40.600 --> 30:41.931
TH REE DAYS.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.267
WE HEARD THAT YOU HAD
A GRUDGE

30:43.300 --> 30:45.336
WITH CHEF ANTONIO.

30:45.370 --> 30:46.632
WERE YOU NEAR HIS RESTAURANT
RECENTLY?

30:46.670 --> 30:49.036
YEAH, I LED A PROTEST
OUTSIDE OF HIS PLACE

30:49.080 --> 30:50.035
ON TUESDAY NIGHT.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.401
TUESDAY NIGHT?

30:52.450 --> 30:54.475
EXCUSE US.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.216
THAT WAS THE SAME NIGHT
THE CRITIC WAS POISONED.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.888
DUDE, I THINK
WE JUST FOUND OUR KILLER.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.182
SUPER--

31:00.220 --> 31:02.359
[Lassiter shouting]
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
SBPD!

31:02.390 --> 31:04.278
WHO'S IN CHARGE
OF THIS FREAK FEST?

31:04.330 --> 31:05.888
(Juliet)
GUYS, WE GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.421
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL US
WHAT THIS HAS TO DO

31:08.460 --> 31:10.291
WITH THE. . .CASE?

31:10.330 --> 31:11.365
(Dwyer)
YOU'RE EATING
A DEAD CARCASS!

31:11.400 --> 31:13.425
NICE SHIRT.
THANKS.

31:13.470 --> 31:16.098
DID YOU BUY THAT TODAY
BY ANY CHANCE?

31:16.140 --> 31:18.358
THIS OLD RAG?
NAH.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.366
I'VE HAD THIS THING
FOR JUST ABOUT FOREVER.

31:20.410 --> 31:23.208
REMEMBER WHEN I SENT OFF
THOSE CEREAL BOX TOPS

31:23.240 --> 31:24.400
TO GET THIS THING?

31:24.450 --> 31:25.439
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.572
SURE I DID.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

31:26.610 --> 31:28.419
IT WAS THE SAME YEAR YOU GOT
YOUR FIRST CABBAGE PATCH--

31:28.450 --> 31:29.678
SHUT UP.
I REMEMBER.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.280
WHY DO YOU ASK, JULES?
NO REASON.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.446
ALL RIGHT, THIS WACK JOB
IS IN VIOLATION

31:33.490 --> 31:35.117
OF AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT
MUNICIPAL CODES,

31:35.160 --> 31:36.616
AND SHE SMELLS LIKE
CURLY FRIES.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.423
I SAY WE CUT HER LOOSE,
TAKE HER DOWN.

31:38.460 --> 31:39.358
WHERE'S THE RESTAURANT
MANAGER?

31:39.390 --> 31:41.358
HE'S PROBABLY INSIDE
MANAGING THE RESTAURANT.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.526
COPY THAT.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.065
WAIT FOR IT.

31:47.100 --> 31:50.297
(Shawn)
WAIT FOR IT...

31:50.340 --> 31:51.307
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

31:51.340 --> 31:53.365
NO, NO, I'M JUST...

31:53.410 --> 31:56.277
MAKING SURE
I'M NOT BEING FOLLOWED.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.198
GOOD COP--ALWAYS AWARE
OF HIS SURROUNDINGS.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.114
[crash]

32:03.150 --> 32:06.244
I BE'ITER GO
HELP HIM.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.580
UNCLE BURTON.
[car door Shuts]

32:08.620 --> 32:11.521
BURTON, I GOT HERE
AS SOON AS I COULD.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.629
WHO ARE ALL
THESE STRANGE PEOPLE?

32:12.660 --> 32:15.424
(Gus)
IT'S ALL A PART
OF OUR INVESTIGATION.

32:15.460 --> 32:16.154
WE HAD TO COME
CHECK OUT A LEAD.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.349
THANKS FOR MEETING ME
DOWN HERE.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.992
OH, NO PROBLEM.

32:19.030 --> 32:20.327
THAT RIDE IN THE CAB
GAVE ME A CHANCE

32:20.370 --> 32:21.439
TO FILL OUT THIS POSTCARD

32:21.470 --> 32:22.630
LE'ITING EVERYBODY
IN THE FAMILY KNOW

32:22.670 --> 32:24.467
ABOUT OUR
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.636
[chuckles]

32:25.670 --> 32:28.468
WELL, I HOPE YOU SAVED
SOME ROOM ON THERE...

32:28.510 --> 32:29.534
'CAUSE I JUST SOLVED
THE CASE.

32:29.580 --> 32:30.433
YEAH?
[Shawn applauds]

32:30.480 --> 32:32.243
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

32:32.280 --> 32:34.510
CHEF ANTONIO
PUT BEEF BROTH

32:34.550 --> 32:36.211
IN HIS VEGGIE BURGERS
AT HIS RESTAURANT,

32:36.250 --> 32:40.243
INFURIATING VEGETARIANS
ALL OVER SANTA BARBARA.

32:40.290 --> 32:43.555
THAT WOMAN TRIED TO
PUT THE CHEF OUT OF BUSINESS.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.387
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK

32:45.430 --> 32:47.352
SO INSTEAD,
SHE POISONED THE CRITIC,

32:47.390 --> 32:49.722
AND FRAMED CHEF ANTONIO
FOR IT.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.727
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.318
I NEVER POISONED ANYBODY.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.291
YOU GUYS ARE NUTS.

32:53.330 --> 32:55.036
HEY, WATCH THE WAY YOU TALK
TO MY NEPHEW,

32:55.070 --> 32:57.561
'CAUSE HE CAN SEE
RIGHT INTO YOUR SOUL.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.068
(GUS)
YOU WERE THERE
ON THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED,

33:00.110 --> 33:01.634
AND I'M SURE THAT
SEEING THE CHEF BEHIND BARS

33:01.680 --> 33:03.568
MUST MAKE YOU PRETTY HAPPY.

33:03.610 --> 33:05.578
WELL, OF COURSE
IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

33:05.610 --> 33:08.477
HE DIDN'T HAVE RESPECT
FOR THE RIGHTS OF ANIMALS.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.714
MEAT IS MURDER.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.639
BUT MURDER IS ALSO MURDER,
MISS DWYER!

33:12.690 --> 33:14.157
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

33:14.190 --> 33:16.158
GUYS, THERE'S BEEN
A DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR CASE.

33:16.190 --> 33:17.714
SOMEONE DIED
FROM EATING DEATH CAPS

33:17.760 --> 33:19.648
THAT WERE DISCARDED
DOWNTOWN YESTERDAY.

33:19.690 --> 33:20.657
YESTERDAY?

33:20.690 --> 33:21.691
YESTERDAY?

33:21.730 --> 33:23.425
DUDE, IT COULDN'T BE HER.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.267
SHE'S BEEN CHAINED
TO A POLE FOR THREE DAYS.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.165
PLUS, WE'RE
NOWHERE NEAR DOWNTOWN.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.167
SHE STILL COULD'VE DONE IT.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.497
SHE COULD HAVE EASILY
HAVE SLIPPED OUT OF HERE

33:28.540 --> 33:29.495
AND DONE IT
WHEN NO ONE WAS AROUND.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.531
ACTUALLY,
SHE COULDN'T HAVE.

33:31.570 --> 33:33.333
WE HAVE A ROUGH DESCRIPTION
OF THE SUSPECT

33:33.370 --> 33:34.530
THAT THREW THE MUSHROOMS AWAY.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.673
IT WAS A SIX-FOOT TALL MAN.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.512
PSYCHIC. . . BOGUS.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.454
(Vick)
OUR SECOND VICTIM WAS
A HOMELESS MAN.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.355
ATE A BAG
OF DEATH CAPS HE SAW

33:52.390 --> 33:54.426
BEING TOSSED IN A DUMPSTER
YESTERDAY,

33:54.460 --> 33:55.825
THEN WENT TO
THE HEALTH CLINIC TODAY

33:55.860 --> 33:57.452
AFTER COMPLAINING
OF ABDOMINAL PAINS.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.320
HE DIED
A FEW HOURS AGO.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.395
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
PERSON WHO DISCARDED THEM?

34:01.440 --> 34:02.668
NOT MUCH.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.361
THE VICTIM DIED
BEFORE HE WAS ABLE

34:04.410 --> 34:06.537
TO GIVE US
AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.

34:06.570 --> 34:08.208
AND CHEF ANTONIO
WAS IN CUSTODY,

34:08.240 --> 34:10.208
SO IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S INNOCENT.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.071
(Lassiter)
NOT IF HE HAD AN ACCOMPLICE.

34:12.110 --> 34:13.509
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THE CHEF,
HIS PARTNER'S OUT THERE

34:13.550 --> 34:14.414
TRYING TO DISPOSE OF EVIDENCE.

34:14.450 --> 34:16.338
LET'S GO DOWN TO LOCKUP,
TALK TO THAT CHEF.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.314
THAN KS.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.452
SEE YOU LATER.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.152
WHERE WAS THE DUMPSTER
LOCATED?

34:25.190 --> 34:26.748
AT THE CORNER
OF LAGUNA AND VISTA.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.821
SHAWN, WE WERE ON
THE RIGHT TRACK.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.691
LAGUNA AND VISTA IS ACROSS
THE STREET FROM THE NEWSPAPER.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.368
WHOEVER THREW OUT
THOSE MUSHROOMS

34:34.400 --> 34:35.367
WORKS AT THE PAPER.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.537
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
OVER THERE.

34:36.570 --> 34:38.709
UNCLE BURTON'S FLIGHT LEAVES
IN AN HOUR.

34:38.740 --> 34:39.866
I DON'T CARE.

34:39.910 --> 34:41.309
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE, SHAWN?

34:41.340 --> 34:42.739
MY ENTIRE FUTURE
WITH MY FAMILY.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.304
YEAH, THAT,
TWO UNSOLVED MURDERS,

34:44.350 --> 34:45.476
AND AN INNOCENT MAN
WHO'S STILL IN JAIL.

34:45.510 --> 34:46.499
BUT YOUR FAMILY TOO.

34:46.550 --> 34:48.541
DUDE, WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THE KILLER IS.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.548
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE LONGER
THAN AN HOUR TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

34:50.580 --> 34:53.219
[knocking]

34:53.250 --> 34:56.413
FINE, LET'S GO
TO THE STUPID AIRPORT.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.422
(Uncle Burton)
LISTEN, BURTON,

34:59.460 --> 35:00.859
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
ALL TO BLAME.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.255
FOR FOULING UP
THIS CASE.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.359
I MEAN, I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK

35:04.400 --> 35:06.425
THAT YOU'D DO BE'ITER
AT THIS DETECTIVE BUSINESS

35:06.470 --> 35:08.438
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SHAWN
WEIGHING YOU DOWN.

35:08.470 --> 35:10.392
I MEAN, I DON'T SEE
WHAT HE'S BRINGING

35:10.440 --> 35:11.407
TO THE OPERATION.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.362
YOU'RE PSYCHIC, HE'S NOT.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.275
WHAT DO YOU NEED HIM
AROUND FOR?

35:15.310 --> 35:17.574
YOU KNOW, GUS,
YOUR UNCLE HAS A POINT.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.749
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
IT WAS MURDER, SHE WROTE,

35:19.780 --> 35:20.747
NOT MURDE THEY WROTE.

35:20.780 --> 35:21.849
THAT'S TRUE.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.677
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.779
I LEFT SOME OF MY CLOTHES
AT THE HOTEL.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.515
MAYBE IF SOMEBODY HADN'T
RUSHED ME DOWN

35:27.550 --> 35:28.687
TO THE BURGER STAND,

35:28.720 --> 35:29.709
I WOULDN'T HAVE FORGO'ITEN
TO PACK

35:29.760 --> 35:31.557
MY NEW YELLOW HIPPO SHIRT.

35:31.590 --> 35:32.727
YOU MEAN
YOUR HIP SHIRTS?

35:32.760 --> 35:34.455
NO, I MEAN
MY HIPPO SHIRT.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.422
I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF 'EM
DOWN ON STATE STREET.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.293
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY I DON'T GO
FOR MODERN FASHION,

35:39.330 --> 35:40.490
BUT THESE HIPPO SHIRTS,

35:40.530 --> 35:41.758
THEY MAKE MY ARMS LOOK
SO HUGE.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.258
THEY'VE GOT A NICE
LI'ITLE HIPPO LOGO

35:45.310 --> 35:46.265
RIGHT ON THE SLEEVE--SEE?

35:46.310 --> 35:47.436
NICE.

35:49.740 --> 35:53.403
HE HAD SUNSHINE
COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.577
HE HAD A HIPPOPOTAMUS
FOR A HAND.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.411
[whispering]
GUS, I JUST FIGURED IT OUT.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.509
WHO HAD THE BEST ACCESS
TO THE PERSON

36:01.560 --> 36:02.709
PICKING THE NEXT
RESTAURANT CRITIC?

36:02.760 --> 36:04.819
THINK ABOUT IT.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.829
UNCLE BURTON, YOU MIGHT BE
A LITTLE LATE FOR YOUR FLIGHT.

36:13.270 --> 36:15.898
SO I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
THAT OUR NEW RESTAURANT CRITIC

36:15.940 --> 36:16.929
WILL BE...

36:16.970 --> 36:19.734
MY HARD-WORKING
ASSISTANT NICK.

36:19.770 --> 36:21.328
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.598
(Nick)
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.868
I AM SO SURPRISED.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.878
I HONESTLY DIDN'T EXPECT
TO GET THIS JOB AT ALL.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.343
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE,
IS IT?!

36:28.380 --> 36:30.439
WHOA, GUS--
DON'T WORRY, I GOT IT.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.483
(Gus)
YOU KNEW THAT PHIL PRITIKIN
WOULD GIVE YOU THIS JOB.

36:33.520 --> 36:36.216
THAT'S WHY YOU MURDERED
VINCE WAGNER.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.784
WAIT-
I SAID I GOT IT.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.754
HANG ON, HANG ON.
YOU'RE SAYING HE'S THE KILLER?

36:41.330 --> 36:42.854
AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
EXACTLY HOW HE DID IT...

36:42.900 --> 36:44.663
IN JUST A SECOND.

36:46.430 --> 36:47.624
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
HOW HE DID IT.

36:47.670 --> 36:48.762
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M TRYING TO STOP YOU?

36:48.800 --> 36:49.767
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

36:49.800 --> 36:50.869
MY UNCLE THINKS
I'M THE PSYCHIC,

36:50.900 --> 36:51.969
THE NEWSPAPER THINKS
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC,

36:52.010 --> 36:54.535
AND THE COPS THINK I'M JUST
TRANSLATING YOUR VISIONS.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.729
GIVE ME A SECOND TO THINK.
HURRY UP.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.678
OKAY, I HAVE A PLAN.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.803
BLURT OUT SOMETHING
NONSENSICAL--DO IT NOW.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.410
KEYLACES, SHOEBOARDS,
PINEAPPLES!
OH, NO.

37:01.450 --> 37:02.576
(Shawn)
THE VISIONS HAVE BECOME
TOO COMPLEX

37:02.620 --> 37:03.541
FOR ONE PERSON TO DECIPHER.

37:03.580 --> 37:05.616
GUS, MIGHT I OFFER
MY HELP?

37:05.650 --> 37:07.538
YES, SHAWN, YOU--
MAGIC HEAD.

37:07.590 --> 37:10.650
TWO HEADS WORKING TOGETHER
AS ONE.

37:10.690 --> 37:11.782
[strained groans]

37:11.830 --> 37:12.922
YOU!

37:12.960 --> 37:15.394
YOU WANTED THE MOST COVETED JOB
THE PAPER HAD TO OFFER,

37:15.430 --> 37:16.692
AND YOU WERE IN THE GOOD GRACES
OF THE ONE GUY

37:16.730 --> 37:18.789
THAT COULD GIVE IT TO YOU,
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

37:18.830 --> 37:20.889
NOW, WHAT WAS THAT PROBLEM?

37:20.930 --> 37:24.366
THE PROBLEM WAS WAGNER
WAS NEVER GOING TO RETIRE.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.662
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:26.710 --> 37:28.029
YOU HATCHED A PLAN

37:28.070 --> 37:29.970
TO FORCE WAGNER
OFF THE JOB.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.875
THE FIRST THING YOU NEEDED
WAS A FALL GUY.

37:31.910 --> 37:35.710
UNFORTUNATELY, LEE MAJORS
WASN'T AVAILABLE.

37:37.450 --> 37:38.678
APPARENTLY,
HE WAS AVAILABLE.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.517
HE LIVES HERE IN TOWN.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.313
BUT HE WAS A LITTLE
OUT OF YOUR PRICE RANGE,

37:42.360 --> 37:44.726
SO YOU FLIPPED THROUGH
WAGNER'S HATE MAIL,

37:44.760 --> 37:45.624
AND YOU DISCOVERED
THAT CHEF ANTONIO

37:45.660 --> 37:46.854
WAS THE PERFECT CANDIDATE.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.688
[pained groan]

37:49.730 --> 37:51.527
YOU KNEW ANTONIO'S
SIGNATURE DISH

37:51.570 --> 37:53.765
WAS HIS
WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO,

37:53.800 --> 37:54.789
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.468
[groaning]
YOU TRACKED DOWN

37:57.500 --> 37:59.400
SOME DEATH CAP MUSHROOMS,

37:59.440 --> 38:01.579
AND BAKED 'EM INTO A RISO'ITO
THAT RESEMBLED ANTONIO'S.

38:01.610 --> 38:02.804
BUT YOU MADE
TWO MISTAKES.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.638
FIRST, YOU SLICED YOUR MUSHROOMS
INTO CUBES

38:05.680 --> 38:07.443
INSTEAD OF STRIPS,
AND SECOND--

38:07.480 --> 38:09.016
UNH!

38:09.050 --> 38:11.712
WAGNER NOTICED THAT
HIS RISO'ITO WAS COLD.

38:11.750 --> 38:12.910
(Gus)
WHY WOULD RISOTI'O
BE SERVED COLD

38:12.950 --> 38:14.759
IN A FIVE-STAR
RESTAURANT?

38:14.790 --> 38:15.586
OW!

38:15.620 --> 38:18.657
BECAUSE...
ANTONIO DIDN'T COOK IT.

38:18.690 --> 38:19.725
YOU SNUCK IT IN.

38:19.760 --> 38:23.594
WE JUST HAD A SURPRISE
INSPECTION A FEW DAYS AGO.

38:23.630 --> 38:25.621
A SIMPLE CALL TO THE COUNTY
WILL CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE

38:25.670 --> 38:26.819
NO REAL HEALTH INSPECTORS

38:26.870 --> 38:27.825
AT ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT
THAT NIGHT.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.929
YOU POSED AS ONE.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.665
(Shawn)
AND THAT GAVE YOU THE COVER
YOU NEEDED

38:31.710 --> 38:35.339
TO SWITCH OUT THE RISO'ITO
WITH YOUR POISONED BATCH.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.977
[Gus crying out]
STOP!

38:44.020 --> 38:46.545
WAGNER DIED,
ANTONIO WAS ARRESTED,

38:46.590 --> 38:48.649
AND NO ONE SUSPECTED
YOU WERE THE REAL KILLER.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.351
THIS--THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS!

38:50.390 --> 38:52.028
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK IN HERE
AND ACCUSE SOMEONE

38:52.060 --> 38:53.049
OF BEING A MURDERER!

38:53.090 --> 38:54.694
WELL, ACTUALLY WE CAN.

38:57.660 --> 38:59.628
DAMN RIGHT WE CAN.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.399
THEY GUY YOU WENT TO
ABOUT THE MUSHROOMS

39:01.440 --> 39:02.930
REMEMBERS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

39:02.970 --> 39:06.565
AFTER HE TONED DOWN
THE DRUG-INDUCED EXAGGERATIONS.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.066
TALL GUY...

39:08.110 --> 39:10.476
ORANGE CHEESE POWDER
AROUND THE MOUTH...

39:10.510 --> 39:12.649
AND A HIPPO LOGO
ON HIS SLEEVE.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.908
AL MOONEY IS INSANE!

39:13.950 --> 39:15.770
NOBODY WILL BELIEVE
WHAT HE SAYS.

39:15.820 --> 39:16.809
(Lassiter)
HANG ON A MINUTE.

39:16.850 --> 39:17.919
I DON'T BELIEVE
ANYONE SAID

39:17.950 --> 39:19.986
THE WITN ESS' NAME.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.908
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.780
CUFF HIM, GUYS.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.924
BUSTED.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.054
I WANT TO TALK
TO A LAWYER.

39:31.130 --> 39:34.497
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
FINALLY ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

39:34.540 --> 39:35.632
YOUR VISIONS AGAIN.

39:35.670 --> 39:37.433
IT FEELS GOOD
TO BE BACK, JULES.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.028
MATTER OF FACT, I'M HAVING
ANOTHER VISION RIGHT NOW.

39:39.070 --> 39:42.779
YOU AND ME CELEBRATING
OVER DINNER, DRINKS.

39:42.810 --> 39:46.974
