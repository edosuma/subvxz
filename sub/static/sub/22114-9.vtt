00:09.171 --> 00:11.130
( theme music playing )

00:15.963 --> 00:17.672
- Larry: Huh?
Is that amazing?
- Cheryl: That is--

00:17.672 --> 00:19.338
- Ted: Unbelievable story!
- Larry: You know what?

00:19.338 --> 00:21.130
None of it
would have happened

00:21.130 --> 00:24.630
if I didn't intercede
on that guy's behalf
in the restaurant.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.755
- Unbelievable, Larry.
- It saved your life.

00:26.755 --> 00:28.839
- Saved my life.
- What if he hadn't
wanted seconds?

00:28.839 --> 00:30.380
None of this
would have happened.

00:30.380 --> 00:31.672
- Larry: None of it
would have happened.
- Bashert.

00:31.672 --> 00:34.255
The fatwa is over!

00:34.255 --> 00:35.422
- Leon: Yes!
- The fatwa is over!

00:35.422 --> 00:36.839
Susie:
Let's drink to that, huh?

00:36.839 --> 00:38.380
It's a new me.
It's a new me.

00:38.380 --> 00:40.463
Well, whatever.
We're glad you're back,
Larry.

00:40.463 --> 00:42.171
- Thank you, Susie.
- Welcome.

00:42.171 --> 00:43.547
Jeff:
I didn't even tell you
the biggest news.

00:43.547 --> 00:46.338
"Fatwa! the Musical"
is back on.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.589
- It is?
- Whoa, wait--
wait a second.

00:48.589 --> 00:50.297
You're jumping the gun
a little bit.

00:50.297 --> 00:53.005
We're having a meeting
with Lin-Manuel Miranda
this week,

00:53.005 --> 00:54.505
and if he wants
to do it, then--

00:54.505 --> 00:57.547
You're meeting
with Lin-Manuel Miranda?
Oh, my--

00:57.547 --> 01:00.505
It's the only way
it can go forward--
is if he's in it.

01:00.505 --> 01:02.839
He's in LA now, right?
Isn't it-- aren't they
doing the show here?

01:02.839 --> 01:04.755
Yeah, they're doing
"Hamilton."

01:04.755 --> 01:07.046
Yeah, can you
get us tickets?
I mean, it's here.

01:07.046 --> 01:08.880
No, it's here
and we can't even
get tickets to it!

01:08.880 --> 01:11.088
Already with
the "Hamilton" tickets?
Are you kidding?

01:11.088 --> 01:12.714
- I would love some, too.
- Huh?

01:12.714 --> 01:13.963
I don't know if I can
get you tickets.

01:13.963 --> 01:15.589
I haven't even
met the guy yet.

01:15.589 --> 01:17.714
- You saw it, right?
- Yeah, I saw it in New York.

01:17.714 --> 01:19.672
- Fantastic.
- Isn't it so fantastic?

01:19.672 --> 01:21.130
Oh, my God,
I love that show.
Incredible.

01:21.130 --> 01:23.338
I saw it
and I played...

01:23.338 --> 01:25.714
( chuckles )
36 holes of golf
that day.

01:25.714 --> 01:30.213
And, uh, I fell asleep
before the second act
of "Hamilton."

01:30.213 --> 01:32.755
- Bridget: You're kidding.
- I slept through-- I slept
through the intermission.

01:32.755 --> 01:34.921
- Bridget: No!
- Susie: You fell asleep?
Wait a minute.

01:34.921 --> 01:38.422
Only you would fall asleep
at the hottest show
on Broadway.

01:38.422 --> 01:40.338
- Ted: Hey, hey. Guys, guys.
- How did you fall asleep?

01:40.338 --> 01:41.797
- It's so exciting
and interesting.
- The Shucker.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.422
- Excuse me, the Shucker.
- Oh, the Shucker.

01:43.422 --> 01:45.505
- Hey, how's everybody doing?
- Susie: Hello.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.046
- Shucker: Taste good?
- Ted: Fantastic.

01:47.046 --> 01:48.463
It's all good?
No grit?

01:48.463 --> 01:49.921
- No grit.
- Okay, no grit.

01:49.921 --> 01:51.921
Just shuck and awe.
Okay, well, that's great.

01:51.921 --> 01:54.171
I've got a--
I got a whole bunch
of bluepoints.

01:54.171 --> 01:55.921
Got some Kusshis
for you all.

01:55.921 --> 01:58.130
- Ted: Whoo!
- Hope you left some room.

01:58.130 --> 02:00.005
- Okay.
- I know he did.
( chuckling )

02:00.005 --> 02:01.714
Susie:
Fantastic.
Cute as could be.

02:01.714 --> 02:03.589
- Ay, God.
- Susie: Shucking?

02:03.589 --> 02:05.338
- What's the matter?
- Bridget: What's the matter?

02:05.338 --> 02:07.797
- Jeff: What happened?
- He overheard that entire story

02:07.797 --> 02:09.589
about me sleeping
through "Hamilton."

02:09.589 --> 02:11.297
What do you care?
What difference does it make?

02:11.297 --> 02:13.297
I just hope it doesn't
get back to-- to Lin.

02:13.297 --> 02:15.422
I doubt that, Larry.
You're paranoid.

02:15.422 --> 02:17.797
He shucks all over town.
I don't know what circles
he shucks in.

02:17.797 --> 02:20.589
- He could shuck and tell.
- ( doorbell rings )

02:20.589 --> 02:23.130
- I'll be back.
- Do you think we can
still get the tickets?

02:23.130 --> 02:25.005
Who's ringing the bell
this time of night?

02:25.005 --> 02:26.714
It's Lin-Manuel Miranda.
( chuckles )

02:26.714 --> 02:28.963
Susie:
I think he heard
about the...

02:28.963 --> 02:33.297
Hello, I'm Rose Shapiro.
Remember me?

02:33.297 --> 02:34.380
No.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.797
I sold you this house
five years ago.

02:36.797 --> 02:38.130
Oh, okay.

02:38.130 --> 02:41.255
Um, well,
what can I do for you?

02:41.255 --> 02:43.338
Well, I was
in the neighborhood

02:43.338 --> 02:45.046
and I thought
I'd just pop in

02:45.046 --> 02:48.338
and see how my house is doing
if that's okay with you.

02:48.338 --> 02:51.380
Actually, I'm--
sorry, I've got
some dinner guests, so.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.171
Well, I won't take
but a minute.

02:53.171 --> 02:56.380
I was so happy in this house.
I lived here for 50 years.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.963
Raised all my children here.
Is that okay?

02:58.963 --> 03:01.088
- Yeah, I-- yeah, okay.
- Oh, oh, thank you.

03:01.088 --> 03:02.672
But it can't be
too long, though, okay?

03:02.672 --> 03:05.589
It won't be, I promise you.
I'll be very discreet.

03:05.589 --> 03:07.963
( gasps )
What have you done here?

03:07.963 --> 03:12.213
You've covered up
that cut stone from Italy
with a rug!

03:12.213 --> 03:14.630
Yeah, well, it needed
a little warming up in here.

03:14.630 --> 03:17.672
It was very cold
and I happen to like it.

03:17.672 --> 03:20.046
And you know what?
It happens to be
my house, so--

03:20.046 --> 03:22.422
And what have
you done in here?

03:22.422 --> 03:24.589
Where's the wonderful
wallpaper I put up?

03:24.589 --> 03:27.505
The wallpaper
with the pirates?
Are you kidding?

03:27.505 --> 03:29.171
It was the first thing
I took down when I moved in.

03:29.171 --> 03:30.463
Well, I guess
it's your house.

03:30.463 --> 03:32.297
You can do anything
you want to.

03:32.297 --> 03:34.130
- Yeah, oh, yes!
- I think I'll check
over here.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.297
That's true!
That-- I can do
anything I want to!

03:37.297 --> 03:38.797
What are you doing--
what the fuck?

03:38.797 --> 03:40.422
I'm checking
the master bedroom.

03:40.422 --> 03:42.880
I don't want you to.
It's my house.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.171
Well, all right.
If you wanna be that way.

03:45.171 --> 03:47.171
Yeah, I think I do
wanna be that way.

03:47.171 --> 03:48.839
I do.
All right,
you know what?

03:48.839 --> 03:51.005
I think it's time to go.
Let's go. Come on.

03:51.005 --> 03:52.589
- ( sighs ) All right.
- Come on.

03:52.589 --> 03:54.297
- I guess I better go.
- Enough. I've had enough.

03:54.297 --> 03:56.255
- Oh!
- Ay-ay-ay.

03:56.255 --> 04:00.005
Look at this poor ficus!
What have you done?

04:00.005 --> 04:03.714
I left this with you
in good faith to love
and cherish.

04:03.714 --> 04:05.714
Yeah, no, I've taken
very good care of it.

04:05.714 --> 04:07.963
- It's old.
- It's dropping all its leaves.
Do you water it?

04:07.963 --> 04:10.547
Of course I water it.
All right, come on, I got
some people here.

04:10.547 --> 04:12.088
You've got to go.
Come on.

04:12.088 --> 04:14.213
There's the door.
Time to go. Thank you.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.422
Good-bye.
Thank you for stopping by.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.213
- Don't do it again.
- Bridget: No, I know, I know.

04:19.213 --> 04:21.463
And then, Todd,
this other guy,

04:21.463 --> 04:23.963
had-- what's the male
equivalent of bush?

04:23.963 --> 04:25.422
- Jeff: Man bush.
- Man bush.

04:25.422 --> 04:28.755
That, like-- so, finding
his penis was like--

04:28.755 --> 04:30.963
I'm searching
for the baby bird
in the--

04:30.963 --> 04:33.672
- Susie: In the nest.
- In the nest.

04:33.672 --> 04:35.422
And then I'm, like,
looking.

04:35.422 --> 04:37.255
I couldn't even
find the goods

04:37.255 --> 04:39.839
because the Afro
was so intense.

04:39.839 --> 04:41.297
Yeah, okay, all right.

04:41.297 --> 04:43.130
I think-- I think we've heard
enough of that story.

04:43.130 --> 04:44.463
- Sorry, Lar.
- But, Larry,

04:44.463 --> 04:45.921
she has so many
funny stories about her exes.

04:45.921 --> 04:47.505
I've been hearing them
for years.

04:47.505 --> 04:49.380
- They're hilarious.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.046
- Yeah.
- Remember the one
you told me about?

04:51.046 --> 04:53.046
- The guy who-- the leaner?
- Yeah, the leaner.

04:53.046 --> 04:54.963
- Yes.
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa?

04:54.963 --> 04:56.589
- That guy?
- The Leaning Tower of Peter.

04:56.589 --> 04:58.797
Yeah, oh, that's--
that's a good one, too.

04:58.797 --> 05:01.046
- That was a good one.
- Bridget: I know, I know.

05:01.046 --> 05:02.797
And then Todd,
this other guy--

05:02.797 --> 05:04.755
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that was
so many years ago.

05:04.755 --> 05:07.630
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.

05:07.630 --> 05:10.380
This room used to be
so warm and inviting.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.463
Mrs. Shapiro, what are--
what are you doing?

05:12.463 --> 05:13.714
- Well, I just--
- I thought you left.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.338
Well, I was
just looking around.

05:15.338 --> 05:17.422
- It used to be so different.
- She used to live in the house.

05:17.422 --> 05:18.963
Uh, she wanted
to look around.

05:18.963 --> 05:21.380
And the house
was so much better
when I had it.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.963
- I don't know what
he's done with this.
- Okay, you need to go now.

05:23.963 --> 05:26.672
- Well, you don't have
to be rude about it.
- You're the one being rude.

05:26.672 --> 05:28.463
You come in here and
you're criticizing my house.

05:28.463 --> 05:30.213
You don't live here
anymore.

05:30.213 --> 05:31.755
That's right,
keep going.

05:31.755 --> 05:35.380
- ( door opens )
- Yeah, and now close it.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.797
- Close it.
- ( door closes )

05:36.797 --> 05:39.171
- Ted: Go-- go back
to the leaner.
- Okay.

05:39.171 --> 05:41.088
( laughs )
The Leaning Tower
of Peter?

05:41.088 --> 05:43.297
- ( all laughing )
- Oh, and he was
a biter, too.

05:43.297 --> 05:45.338
He used to bite me
on the ass.

05:45.338 --> 05:47.672
- Which was not as bad as--
- Leon: A bite on the damn
nipple!

05:47.672 --> 05:51.463
- ( laughing )
- Bridget: Oh, my God, totally.
'Cause that hurts.

05:51.463 --> 05:53.088
Well, that's it,
everybody.

05:53.088 --> 05:55.255
- I'm all done
for the night.
- Whoo!

05:55.255 --> 05:57.505
Thanks.
It's been a privilege
working for you tonight.

05:57.505 --> 05:59.005
And I hope
you agree with me

05:59.005 --> 06:02.171
that this has been
a spectacular "shuck-cess."

06:02.171 --> 06:04.297
- Whoa!
- Oh, nice. Okay.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.088
- Thank you.
- I'll-- I'll walk you out.

06:06.088 --> 06:07.714
- Susie: He's adorable.
- Bridget: Yeah.

06:07.714 --> 06:09.921
- Bridge,
what was the guy...
- Anyway, um,

06:09.921 --> 06:11.005
it was great having
you here tonight.

06:11.005 --> 06:12.338
Everybody
really enjoyed it.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.839
I hope so.
I hope so.

06:13.839 --> 06:15.338
- Had a great time.
- Yeah. Yeah, it was great.

06:15.338 --> 06:18.005
Um, I just wanna say
one thing.

06:18.005 --> 06:20.463
You know,
earlier when I was
talking about "Hamilton,"

06:20.463 --> 06:24.921
what-- what
you didn't hear me say
was that I played,

06:24.921 --> 06:29.380
uh, 36 holes
of golf that day
and I was exhausted.

06:29.380 --> 06:33.797
And that's one
of the reasons
I was so tired,

06:33.797 --> 06:35.422
uh, during
the performance.

06:35.422 --> 06:39.547
I mean, I-- I loved
what I-- what I saw.

06:39.547 --> 06:44.921
Sure. What I heard
was that you fell asleep.

06:44.921 --> 06:47.130
Yes, I did fall asleep,
but what you didn't hear

06:47.130 --> 06:49.380
is why  I fell asleep,
why I was so tired.

06:49.380 --> 06:50.880
- I loved the show.
- Sure.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.422
You can paint it
or dress it up

06:53.422 --> 06:57.630
anyway you want,
but sleep is sleep.

06:57.630 --> 07:01.046
- And you fell asleep.
- Yeah.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.088
- All right?
- True, I did.

07:04.088 --> 07:06.921
But, uh, I would hope
that as you shuck

07:06.921 --> 07:09.589
from house to house
that, uh,

07:09.589 --> 07:14.255
you can afford me
some shucker discretion
in this matter.

07:14.255 --> 07:16.255
- I understand.
- Oh.

07:16.255 --> 07:18.463
- And I appreciate that.
- Good. Thank you.

07:18.463 --> 07:22.213
And I would
also appreciate, um,

07:22.213 --> 07:23.921
two tickets
to "Hamilton."

07:26.714 --> 07:29.839
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.046
Well...
( sighs )

07:31.046 --> 07:33.921
I don't have any access

07:33.921 --> 07:36.130
to getting you tickets
to "Hamilton," okay?

07:36.130 --> 07:39.046
- It's most unfortunate.
- And why is-- why is that?

07:39.046 --> 07:44.963
It'd be a shame
if Lin-Manuel Miranda

07:44.963 --> 07:49.589
ever found out that someone
was falling asleep
in his show.

07:51.797 --> 07:55.589
- I'll see
what I can do.
- Super.

07:55.589 --> 07:57.171
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:01.463 --> 08:04.213
- ( door opens, closes )
- Susie: I like that guy.

08:04.213 --> 08:05.921
- Oh, he was adorable.
- Cheryl: He was adorable.

08:05.921 --> 08:08.714
- What? Who?
- This cake is unbelievable.

08:08.714 --> 08:10.880
- Bridget: I know.
- Oh, it's the best cheesecake.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.171
Um, all right.

08:12.171 --> 08:14.963
I think, uh--
I think we're good here.

08:14.963 --> 08:16.046
I think that's enough.

08:16.046 --> 08:17.338
- What?
- That's enough.

08:17.338 --> 08:19.297
- What are you talking about?
- Time to go.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.505
We're having afterdinner
conversation, Larry.

08:21.505 --> 08:23.880
- It's enough.
- You know, this is
so typical of you.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.880
I don't like
all the lingering
after dinner.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.630
You had your dessert.
Get-- get the hell out.
Come on, get out.

08:29.630 --> 08:32.547
All right,
thank you for ruining
a lovely  evening.

08:32.547 --> 08:34.921
On the contrary,
didn't ruin it.
Saved it.

08:34.921 --> 08:37.338
- Uh-huh. Bridget,
call me tomorrow.
- I saved it.

08:37.338 --> 08:38.963
- Mwah. Cheryl, Ted.
- Mwah. I'll call you.

08:38.963 --> 08:41.005
All right, okay, come on.
Time to go, people.

08:41.005 --> 08:42.380
- Hey.
- Ted: This is your Larry.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.505
- Whose is this?
- Oh, I don't know.

08:44.505 --> 08:46.630
Maybe-- maybe
the Shucker left it.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.005
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.547
Man, this is cool.

08:49.547 --> 08:51.171
- Susie: Ooh.
- You know what?
( snaps fingers )

08:51.171 --> 08:52.380
- Ooh, Jeffrey.
- Keep it.

08:52.380 --> 08:53.589
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:53.589 --> 08:55.589
Oh, definitely keep it.
I love it.

08:55.589 --> 08:57.672
- You do?
- It looks fantastic
on you.

08:57.672 --> 08:58.797
- Really?
- Looks good.

08:58.797 --> 08:59.839
How about that?

08:59.839 --> 09:02.130
Look at me.
I'm the sheriff.

09:02.130 --> 09:04.921
Now let's go home,
Sheriff.
Come on.

09:04.921 --> 09:06.171
- Yeah.
- All right, people.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.547
- Okay, yep.
- Let's go.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.755
- Time to go.
- We're getting kicked out.

09:09.755 --> 09:12.088
Jeff:
She's showing me love
and affection

09:12.088 --> 09:13.755
that I've never
felt before.

09:13.755 --> 09:16.088
- 'Cause of the hat.
- All 'cause of the hat.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.547
She listens
to what I say.

09:17.547 --> 09:19.505
She takes suggestions.

09:19.505 --> 09:22.338
And all she wants to do
is have sex.

09:22.338 --> 09:23.505
- Susie?
- Yes.

09:23.505 --> 09:25.338
So I have to keep
the hat on during sex.

09:25.338 --> 09:26.839
- That's her thing.
- What?

09:26.839 --> 09:29.130
Yeah. I haven't had
this much sex since college.

09:29.130 --> 09:31.880
- Wow.
- It's almost like,
you know,

09:31.880 --> 09:35.005
she's got a thing
for cowboys from her past
or something.

09:35.005 --> 09:37.213
She's got
a real perversion,
doesn't she?

09:37.213 --> 09:39.880
Yeah, she loves
the Old West.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.547
Where are the women
who have a bald perversion?

09:41.547 --> 09:43.380
I wonder if there's, like,
a place they all hang out.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.921
You just walk in
and, you know.

09:44.921 --> 09:46.589
I wonder if it's worth
investigating.

09:46.589 --> 09:48.005
- You wonder?
- ( laughs )

09:48.005 --> 09:49.839
I would have already
investigated it.

09:49.839 --> 09:54.880
I would have--
I would have blown up Google
with-- if I were you.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.921
- Hey, by the way.
- Yeah?

09:55.921 --> 09:57.630
Today with--
with Lin...

09:57.630 --> 10:00.088
- Yeah.
- Okay?

10:00.088 --> 10:02.797
You don't think
he's gonna wanna write
the songs, do you?

10:02.797 --> 10:04.338
Hmm, I hadn't
thought of that,

10:04.338 --> 10:05.921
but I-- I don't know.

10:05.921 --> 10:07.171
They're my songs.
I don't wanna--

10:07.171 --> 10:08.422
Your songs.
And can I say something?

10:08.422 --> 10:09.630
- Yeah.
- I love those songs.

10:09.630 --> 10:10.797
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:10.797 --> 10:12.422
Woman:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

10:12.422 --> 10:14.547
Lin isn't here yet,
but if you'd like
to go upstairs

10:14.547 --> 10:15.755
to Aaron's office,
you can.

10:15.755 --> 10:16.963
Oh.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.589
Ma'am.

10:25.714 --> 10:27.505
How you doing?

10:27.505 --> 10:30.297
- ( chuckles )
- ( phone rings )

10:33.714 --> 10:35.213
- Larry! Hey.
- Hey!

10:35.213 --> 10:37.005
Come on in,
come on in.
Jeff, hi.

10:37.005 --> 10:38.297
- How you doing, Aaron?
- Aaron Warden.

10:38.297 --> 10:39.422
- Yeah. I know you.
- Nice to meet you.

10:39.422 --> 10:41.130
Hello, hello.
Nice hat.

10:41.130 --> 10:43.088
- Thank you.
- You're just coming
back from Vegas?

10:43.088 --> 10:45.880
Uh, no.
This is my new look.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.422
I like it.
I like how you think.

10:47.422 --> 10:50.505
( laughs )
Lin's very excited,
by the way.

10:50.505 --> 10:53.130
I read the play
personally.
Great.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.630
- Laughed a lot.
- Really?

10:54.630 --> 10:56.380
- Great moments,
great comedy.
- Wow.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.046
We're really excited,
seriously.

10:58.046 --> 11:00.380
And you think
that he's interested
in-- in playing Salman?

11:00.380 --> 11:02.422
I think so.
The only issue--
he's so busy.

11:02.422 --> 11:05.005
So busy right now.
You know, the world
is after him.

11:05.005 --> 11:06.338
What's that?
"Judge Judy"?

11:06.338 --> 11:08.380
- Oh, you like Judith?
- Oh, I love Judge Judy.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.921
- Are you kidding?
- Good. Good, good.
She's my client.

11:09.921 --> 11:11.046
If I ever had
to go to court,

11:11.046 --> 11:12.630
I would like for her
to adjudicate.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.297
- That's how good she is.
- But she's tough.

11:14.297 --> 11:16.088
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Oh, there he is!

11:16.088 --> 11:17.630
- Our national treasure.
- Hey! Jeff. How are you?

11:17.630 --> 11:21.171
Jeff, Lin.
Larry, Lin.
Nice to see you.

11:21.171 --> 11:22.839
- How did it go? Good?
- It was good.

11:22.839 --> 11:24.463
- Yeah, I think we're done.
- Good. I'm excited.

11:24.463 --> 11:26.921
All right,
I was just telling them
how excited we are.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.380
Thank you so much
for bringing this to us.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.046
- It's so exciting.
- Oh, oh, thank--

11:30.046 --> 11:32.755
you know,
I loved "Hamilton,"
needless to say.

11:32.755 --> 11:34.880
- I saw it with you.
- Oh, great. Awesome.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.171
You know, I know
the show's in LA right now.
Everybody's loving it.

11:37.171 --> 11:41.171
I was wondering,
would it be possible to get
two tickets for my shucker?

11:43.088 --> 11:45.005
For your shucker?
Like an oyster shucker?

11:45.005 --> 11:48.338
Yeah, yeah, oyster shucker.
Yeah. Fantastic shucker.
So fast.

11:48.338 --> 11:52.005
- He's your personal shucker?
- No. He-- he shucks for me
from time to time.

11:52.005 --> 11:54.463
Hey, if he's important to you,
sure, I'll-- I'll--

11:54.463 --> 11:56.463
- no promises, but I'll ask.
- Oh, thank you.

11:56.463 --> 11:57.880
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.547
All right, I'll let
you chat together,

11:59.547 --> 12:01.171
and my office
is your office.

12:01.171 --> 12:02.963
Have a great time.
I'm excited about this.

12:02.963 --> 12:04.714
- Great work again, Larry.
- Thanks again.

12:04.714 --> 12:06.046
Thanks for letting us
use the office.

12:06.046 --> 12:08.547
Appreciate it.
Let's have a seat, guys.

12:08.547 --> 12:11.505
Okay, let's see.
Where do you want...

12:13.921 --> 12:15.338
( sighs )

12:16.547 --> 12:18.130
Right.

12:18.130 --> 12:20.797
So, "Fatwa! the Musical."

12:20.797 --> 12:22.130
Where do you guys
wanna do it?

12:22.130 --> 12:23.880
Well, you know,
we're thinking...

12:23.880 --> 12:25.130
- Broadway.
- Broadway.

12:25.130 --> 12:26.880
Broadway?
All right.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.297
I think you're
gonna wanna try it
out of town first.

12:29.297 --> 12:31.921
You know, why not LA?
I think you should do it here.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.714
- Okay.
- Nice.

12:37.714 --> 12:39.213
And who do you see
for a cast?

12:39.213 --> 12:44.130
Obviously, we'd like you
to play, um, Salman.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.171
- Oh, "Salmon."
- Salman.

12:46.171 --> 12:47.130
Yeah, "Salmon" Rushdie.

12:49.046 --> 12:50.380
"Salmon," yeah.

12:50.380 --> 12:53.046
And, um, Mandy Patinkin
for, uh...

12:53.046 --> 12:55.255
- No one but Mandy Patinkin.
- ...for the ayatollah.

12:55.255 --> 12:56.255
F. Murray Abraham.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.880
- Yeah. Good idea.
Let's do that.
- Yeah. I'm telling you.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.088
- ( phone buzzes )
- The "F" is for
fucking awesome.

13:03.088 --> 13:04.547
I'm sorry.

13:04.547 --> 13:06.380
I'm getting a--
I'm sorry, guys,
this is London.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.422
Can I just have you guys
step outside for a second?
Thanks so much.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.088
This is really
going well.
Hello?

13:12.088 --> 13:13.463
What the hell's
wrong with you?

13:13.463 --> 13:16.547
- You said yes
to everything.
- Yeah.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.672
You were
so determined downstairs.
What the hell happened?

13:21.839 --> 13:23.797
- It's the desk.
- The desk?

13:23.797 --> 13:26.505
Yes.
It's the power of the desk.
He's up high, I'm down low.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.088
Everything
he says, I say yes to.
He's in the boss chair.

13:29.088 --> 13:31.630
- He's-- he's like--
it's like he's my boss.
- This is not good.

13:31.630 --> 13:33.839
We gotta do everything
we can to get him out
from behind the desk.

13:33.839 --> 13:37.630
- Okay.
- Lin-Manuel: Hey, you guys
can come on back in.

13:37.630 --> 13:39.463
Please, make yourselves
comfortable.

13:41.963 --> 13:44.046
( grunts )

13:44.046 --> 13:47.130
I got an idea.
Why don't you sit over here?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.130
Yeah, no.
I'm comfortable.
Thank you so much.

13:49.130 --> 13:51.046
- Larry: Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm great.

13:51.046 --> 13:53.714
I gotta tell you,
we could have a real nice,
intimate discussion over here.

13:53.714 --> 13:55.672
You know, we'll be able
to kind of really
kick it around.

13:55.672 --> 13:57.463
Yeah, I feel like
we're at a nice, wide angle.

13:57.463 --> 13:59.046
This is a nice
bird's-eye view
of the piece.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.839
I gotta tell you something,
I'm getting laryngitis

14:00.839 --> 14:02.672
screaming across the room,
you're so far away.

14:02.672 --> 14:04.005
Well, I'm enthusiastic
about it, too.

14:04.005 --> 14:05.755
I think we're
on the same page.

14:05.755 --> 14:09.255
Listen, not only
do I wanna play "Salmon,"
I wanna write the songs.

14:09.255 --> 14:12.714
- Yeah, but I-- I've
written all the songs.
- Yeah.

14:12.714 --> 14:15.714
- That's all done.
- It's a great
starting point for us.

14:15.714 --> 14:17.547
You know, what you've written
is-- it's a great bedrock.

14:17.547 --> 14:19.463
It's a great foundation
for-- for me to--

14:19.463 --> 14:21.005
you know, 'cause
it's inspiring me so much.

14:21.005 --> 14:22.338
You know, let's start
with the opening.

14:22.338 --> 14:23.589
What?
The opening?

14:23.589 --> 14:25.422

terrific as is.

14:52.213 --> 14:53.963
No, have a seat.
I'm not done.

14:53.963 --> 14:55.046
Oh, okay-- okay.

14:55.046 --> 14:56.130
Yeah.
No, have a seat
over here.

14:56.130 --> 14:57.422
Yeah,
right where you were.

14:57.422 --> 14:59.046
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

14:59.046 --> 15:02.297
We're in a flow right now.
You're doing great.

15:02.297 --> 15:03.880
Listen, I feel like
I have a lot of ideas

15:03.880 --> 15:05.547
and maybe
we should call
another meeting

15:05.547 --> 15:07.463
where I can really download
everything that's in my head,

15:07.463 --> 15:08.921
'cause I'm just scratching
the surface here.

15:08.921 --> 15:10.797
I love what we've all
come up with together,

15:10.797 --> 15:12.046
so let's have
another meeting

15:12.046 --> 15:13.672
in a couple weeks
to keep working.

15:15.589 --> 15:17.046
Okay.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.714
Great.

15:18.714 --> 15:21.505
I have a couple of calls
to make to the West End
before it closes.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.088
Yeah, all right,
give me the room.
Thanks.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.297
- This is
just the beginning.
- Yeah.

15:24.297 --> 15:25.505
- Awesome.
- See you.

15:25.505 --> 15:26.755
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

15:31.338 --> 15:33.797
Ugh, how can you eat
that thing, Riggs?

15:33.797 --> 15:35.921
Hey, it's breakfast,
the most important meal
of the day.

15:35.921 --> 15:37.839
( scoffs )
What's the name
of this show?

15:37.839 --> 15:40.797
- "Chicago Homicide."
- Oh, my God, you poor kid.

15:40.797 --> 15:42.589
( laughs )
It's not that bad.

15:42.589 --> 15:44.839
- People love it.
- Two bullet wounds
to the chest...

15:44.839 --> 15:46.380
- Larry: People love this?
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.297
People will watch anything
with "Chicago" in the title.

15:48.297 --> 15:49.921
- It's been proven.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.

15:49.921 --> 15:53.088
Yeah.
( laughs )

15:53.088 --> 15:55.297
Ow. Could this couch
be any more uncomfortable?

15:55.297 --> 15:58.839
- You could have a new couch.
- And that's gonna require
people...

15:58.839 --> 16:00.422
- Oh, that's annoying.
- ...lugging something

16:00.422 --> 16:02.422
up the stairs,
lugging this out.

16:02.422 --> 16:04.630
I can't stand to see
people doing manual labor
in front of me.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.297
- Movers in particular.
- Right. Right.

16:08.297 --> 16:10.088
- Wow.
- A piano.

16:10.088 --> 16:11.839
- Nightmare. Tears.
- Oh, my God.

16:11.839 --> 16:13.505
I wouldn't get a piano
just because

16:13.505 --> 16:15.921
I wouldn't want them to move
the piano into my house.

16:19.255 --> 16:21.797
- That's so stupid.
- It is, but it's true.

16:21.797 --> 16:25.130
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16:25.130 --> 16:27.755
Interesting,
the things I'm learning.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.630
Just like talking
to all your friends
the other night.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.171
They were so, uh, nice.
That was fun.

16:33.797 --> 16:35.714
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Mmm.

16:35.714 --> 16:38.297
Except maybe...

16:38.297 --> 16:42.297
at the end
when you were talking
about those guys.

16:42.297 --> 16:45.547
( laughs )
Susie loves
those stories.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.963
- I don't know why.
- Yeah.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.672
I guess
I kept thinking...

16:50.672 --> 16:54.714
( scoffs )
what if-- what if that was me
she was talking about?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.213
( laughs )

16:56.213 --> 16:58.130
Well, I won't talk
about you, Larry.
Don't worry.

16:58.130 --> 17:01.297
Is there anything
you've observed thus far
or noticed

17:01.297 --> 17:05.505
that you might
wanna talk about
at a dinner party?

17:05.505 --> 17:09.839
No. Everything's
completely just regular.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.880
Woman on TV:
They're too much trouble.
I'm officially done dating.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.463
- "Regular."
- If I get lonely,
I'll just rent a penis.

17:15.463 --> 17:20.505
( gasps )
Ah! That is a--
an unapproved "penis."

17:20.505 --> 17:23.380
I'm so sorry,
I gotta call this in
before they...

17:23.380 --> 17:24.921
It's Bridget for Bill.

17:24.921 --> 17:26.714
( muffled clattering )

17:26.714 --> 17:28.380
No, he knows
why I'm calling.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.255
You hear something?

17:30.255 --> 17:32.213
Sorry,
I didn't-- I...

17:32.213 --> 17:33.338
Yeah.

17:33.338 --> 17:36.547
No, tell him
I'm holding for him.

17:36.547 --> 17:38.213
Don't let him get away.

17:38.213 --> 17:41.714
- Rose: You're so thirsty.
- Oh, my-- what?

17:41.714 --> 17:44.380
What?!
What are you
doing here?

17:44.380 --> 17:47.547
Well, obviously, I'm keeping
this plant alive.

17:47.547 --> 17:50.005
- It's dying here.
- How did you get in here?

17:50.005 --> 17:53.422
I have my own keys.
You forgot to change the locks.

17:53.422 --> 17:56.672
Okay, I want
that key back, okay?
And you need to go.

17:56.672 --> 17:58.046
This is not
a college dormitory

17:58.046 --> 17:59.213
where you can visit
years later

17:59.213 --> 18:00.547
and catch up on things.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.380
We don't have
alumni weekends, okay?

18:02.380 --> 18:04.213
I never should have
sold this house to you.

18:04.213 --> 18:07.171
You're destroying it
and you're certainly
destroying this plant.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.213
Okay, you listen to me,
Shapiro, all right?

18:09.213 --> 18:10.797
- Get out!
- All right.

18:10.797 --> 18:12.463
It's not your house!
It's my house!

18:12.463 --> 18:14.297
I live here, not you!

18:14.297 --> 18:16.505
What a fucking psycho.

18:16.505 --> 18:19.297
( Susie crying out )

18:19.297 --> 18:21.505
Fuck me, Tex!

18:21.505 --> 18:24.255
( crying out )

18:26.297 --> 18:29.338
You know how she got in?
She used her key.

18:29.338 --> 18:31.547
- You didn't change the locks?
- I never changed the locks.

18:31.547 --> 18:32.630
So crazy.

18:34.297 --> 18:36.797
- Speaking of crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

18:36.797 --> 18:40.088
- I mean, what the fuck?
- It is the new me.
I am all in.

18:40.088 --> 18:42.589
- The boots, too?
- The boots, too.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.130
I'm going
for the whole thing.

18:44.130 --> 18:46.213
Women love it.
They go nuts.

18:46.213 --> 18:48.672
The only downside
is I gotta keep
fucking my wife.

18:48.672 --> 18:50.589
- Sick of it?
- Oh, so sick of it.

18:50.589 --> 18:54.338
Yeah. Hey, we gotta talk about
this-- this meeting with Lin.

18:54.338 --> 18:57.380
- Yeah.
- I gotta sit
behind the desk today.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.672
- Oh, yeah.
- Change the whole dynamic.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.171
Well, you just
don't wanna piss him off,
that's all I can say.

19:02.171 --> 19:05.338
I'm not gonna piss him off,
but, you know, I need--
I need...

19:05.338 --> 19:07.714
to wrest creative control
from him somehow.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.505
He's taking over
the whole goddamn thing.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.755
Did-- did you...

19:14.755 --> 19:17.755
- Did you overhear what I--
- Yes, I did.

19:17.755 --> 19:22.297
I hope you'll exercise
some receptionist discretion...

19:25.297 --> 19:26.672
Just gotta keep it down.

19:26.672 --> 19:28.672
Everybody's got
such a big mouth.

19:28.672 --> 19:31.422
- Yeah.
- Nobody can hear anything
and keep it to themselves.

19:31.422 --> 19:35.297
- Hey!
- ( laughs )
Oh, look at you.

19:35.297 --> 19:36.505
- Nice.
- Jeff: Yeah.

19:36.505 --> 19:37.839
Yeah, you can
pull that off.

19:37.839 --> 19:39.547
- You're with this agency?
- Yeah.

19:39.547 --> 19:41.213
Yeah, I don't know
why I bother, though.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.589
Yeah, it's enough
with the acting already.

19:42.589 --> 19:44.672
How long do you have
to do it for?

19:44.672 --> 19:48.005
- Why don't you quit? Huh?
- Nah, I got a few more parts
in me, come on.

19:48.005 --> 19:50.338
Every time
I turn on the television,
I have to see you.

19:50.338 --> 19:52.338
It's enough. Retire.
Why don't you retire?

19:52.338 --> 19:54.505
- ( laughs ) Yeah.
Maybe I--
- Huh?

19:54.505 --> 19:56.171
We gonna see you
this weekend?

19:56.171 --> 19:58.505
Uh, no, actually,
I-- I'm not--

19:58.505 --> 20:00.672
Cheryl and I
are going up to Tahoe.

20:00.672 --> 20:03.505
- Oh, we-- we went there once.
- Yeah, I know.

20:03.505 --> 20:06.088
She, uh--
she told me.

20:06.088 --> 20:08.630
( laughing )

20:14.714 --> 20:16.505
Something funny
happen in Tahoe?

20:16.505 --> 20:19.088
No. Uh-uh.

20:19.088 --> 20:21.672
- Something weird?
- No. Nope.

20:21.672 --> 20:24.380
- I think something
happened in Tahoe.
- Nothing happened in Tahoe.

20:24.380 --> 20:27.714
- What happened in Tahoe?
- Nothing happened in Tahoe,
Jeff, okay?

20:27.714 --> 20:29.839
Can you look at me
and tell me nothing
happened in Tahoe?

20:29.839 --> 20:31.797
- Nothing happened in Tahoe!
- Something happened in Tahoe!

20:31.797 --> 20:33.880
- Nothing happened!
- Trust me, something happened.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.714
- Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.
- Oh! Hey.

20:35.714 --> 20:37.213
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you.

20:37.213 --> 20:38.213
Oh, great to see this.

20:38.213 --> 20:40.213
This is developing.
I like it.

20:40.213 --> 20:42.088
It's working really well.
Keep workshopping.
It's great.

20:42.088 --> 20:44.463
- Hey, did you get the tickets
for the shucker?
- Oh, I asked.

20:44.463 --> 20:45.921
They weren't--
they weren't able to do it.

20:45.921 --> 20:48.714
- I'm sorry.
- They? Who's they?

20:48.714 --> 20:49.839
Yeah, well,
you know, I mean,

20:49.839 --> 20:51.797
if it were for you...
no problem.

20:51.797 --> 20:53.880
You'd go as my guest.
It's my pleasure.

20:53.880 --> 20:58.380
But a shucker you met once
who's good at shucking...

20:58.380 --> 21:00.880
Well, he's not
just good at shucking;
he's great at shucking.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.171
Again, for you, no problem.
In a second.

21:03.171 --> 21:06.255
Anytime you wanna go,
please let me know.

21:08.797 --> 21:11.005
Okay.
Yeah, okay, I'll go.

21:11.005 --> 21:13.380
I'll-- I'll take
the tickets.

21:13.380 --> 21:15.422
- You'll take them?
- Yeah.

21:15.422 --> 21:18.755
- For the same day
that the shucker was...
- Yeah.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.255
- Now they're for you?
- Yeah.

21:20.255 --> 21:21.463
You'll be there
at the show?

21:23.130 --> 21:24.714
Yeah. Yeah.

21:24.714 --> 21:25.921
Are you sure?

21:25.921 --> 21:27.297
Yeah.

21:27.297 --> 21:29.046
Are you really sure?

21:29.046 --> 21:30.880
I'm really sure.

21:45.171 --> 21:48.338
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, Aaron
just left the office.

21:48.338 --> 21:49.589
You can have it
for your meeting.

21:49.589 --> 21:51.839
- Let's go to work.
- Great.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.963
( sotto voce )
I gotta get that desk.

21:57.297 --> 21:59.963
So, um,
how do you like LA?

21:59.963 --> 22:01.755
I like it okay.
Getting used to driving.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.963
- Yeah.
Oh, d-- you drive?
- Yeah.

22:04.963 --> 22:06.630
You-- do you have
a car in New York?

22:06.630 --> 22:08.589
No, not in New York,
but I have one here
I've been renting.

22:08.589 --> 22:10.005
- It's pretty great.
- Uh-huh.

22:10.005 --> 22:11.630
Yeah, I'm getting used
to the traffic.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.005
Yeah.
How come you don't have
a car in New York?

22:13.005 --> 22:14.463
Oh, you don't need one
with the subway.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.714
I know.
I wish they'd get
some kind of...

22:16.714 --> 22:19.088
You know, I pretty much
take the train...

22:19.088 --> 22:21.005
( both grunting )

22:24.171 --> 22:27.547
( groaning )

22:27.547 --> 22:29.338
( sighs )

22:29.338 --> 22:30.547
"Fatwa!..."

22:30.547 --> 22:33.380
- ( groans )
- "...the Musical."

22:38.589 --> 22:40.171
Yeah, have a seat, guys.

22:40.171 --> 22:42.130
I had
a couple of questions
about act two

22:42.130 --> 22:44.338
and a couple of ideas
that I think are really
gonna help us.

22:44.338 --> 22:46.672
You know,
there's always a bit of a drag
in the middle of act two

22:46.672 --> 22:49.589
and I think we can attack that
in a really innovative way.

22:49.589 --> 22:52.797
- Do you have
a pad and a pen?
- Yeah, sure.

22:52.797 --> 22:55.005
( snaps fingers )
I'll have, uh, Lucy
get that for you.

22:55.005 --> 22:56.755
Lucy?

22:56.755 --> 22:58.338
Leon:
Come on, Larry.
Spit that shit out.

22:58.338 --> 22:59.755
What happened in Tahoe?

22:59.755 --> 23:03.213
Listen, you can ask
as many questions
as you want.

23:03.213 --> 23:06.963
You are not going
to find out from me
what happened in Tahoe.

23:06.963 --> 23:11.046
- ( groans )
- If you really wanted to
find out, go ask Ted Danson.

23:11.046 --> 23:12.630
Okay? Let me
tell you something.

23:12.630 --> 23:14.255
There's just
no discretion anymore.

23:14.255 --> 23:16.921
I had to give
that fucking shucker
two tickets to "Hamilton."

23:16.921 --> 23:18.547
Who knows if he's gonna
keep his trap shut?

23:18.547 --> 23:21.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and by the way,

23:21.463 --> 23:23.672
you were at the table
the other night.

23:23.672 --> 23:25.921
Bridget-- you heard that,
what she was going on about.

23:25.921 --> 23:28.171
- That's some good-ass
dick stories, man.
- Horrifying.

23:28.171 --> 23:29.921
She could be talking
that way about me.

23:29.921 --> 23:31.547
If you're so goddamn
worried about it,

23:31.547 --> 23:33.505
make her sign an agreement
that she won't fucking talk.

23:33.505 --> 23:35.213
What do you mean,
like a nondisclosure
agreement?

23:35.213 --> 23:37.380
Fucking non-disclosure.
Make her sign that shit.

23:37.380 --> 23:39.380
You know, they have it
for housekeepers.

23:39.380 --> 23:41.213
You know, then--
so they can't talk
about it.

23:41.213 --> 23:42.589
They should
have that for sex.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.255
They should have it
for sex, but they don't.

23:44.255 --> 23:46.171
People don't sign
"fuck documents."

23:46.171 --> 23:48.130
- If you nervous
about your johnson...
- ( knocking on door )

23:48.130 --> 23:49.630
...make her sign
some shit.

23:52.797 --> 23:54.630
( sighs )

23:57.422 --> 23:59.422
- Take it.
- Huh?

23:59.422 --> 24:01.714
I'm done.

24:01.714 --> 24:05.505
- You all right?
- No, I'm not.
I'm not all right.

24:05.505 --> 24:06.880
- Oh, Jesus.
- Can we sit down?

24:06.880 --> 24:09.255
- Yeah, yeah.
Come in here.
- All right.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.672
Jeff:
Susie sprained my dick.

24:13.672 --> 24:17.963
- What?
- Wearing that hat has been
nothing but a curse for me.

24:17.963 --> 24:20.589
She took my dick to places
it wasn't meant to go.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.963
So far to the right,
so far to the left.

24:22.963 --> 24:25.547
- Back and forth.
- You need a dick
chiropractor.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.463
- Dick chiropractor?
There's dick chiropractors?
- Yeah.

24:27.463 --> 24:28.921
- Of course there are.
- Really?

24:28.921 --> 24:30.297
You know how many times
I fucked my dick up?

24:30.297 --> 24:32.046
- Several times.
- Oh, it's just--

24:32.046 --> 24:34.463
it's the worst thing
I've ever experienced.

24:34.463 --> 24:35.963
I'm taking these.
I'm popping these.

24:35.963 --> 24:37.797
This just cuts the pain.

24:37.797 --> 24:39.963
- Do you have any extra?
- Yeah, sure.

24:39.963 --> 24:42.297
- Lin-Manuel landed
on my shoulder.
- I remember.

24:42.297 --> 24:44.297
- I'm in terrible pain.
- Yeah, I remember.

24:44.297 --> 24:45.463
- But be careful.
- Thank you.

24:45.463 --> 24:46.714
Those are really strong.

24:46.714 --> 24:48.130
Take them only
if you need them.

24:48.130 --> 24:49.297
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

24:49.297 --> 24:50.589
Hey! Great news.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.547
I've been so focused
on my dick,

24:52.547 --> 24:54.213
I forgot to tell you
the good news.

24:54.213 --> 24:57.046
The good news is
I talked to his agent.

24:57.046 --> 24:59.755
Lin-Manuel Miranda
is in.

24:59.755 --> 25:02.338
- Oh! Wow, yeah.
Hey. Great.
- Yeah! Yeah!

25:02.338 --> 25:04.505
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah, all right.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.921
- I'm not surprised.
- I told you, I said
it was a sure thing.

25:06.921 --> 25:09.171
He's getting
everything he wants.
Why shouldn't he be in?

25:09.171 --> 25:13.088
I got Funkhouser invested.
I got Lewis invested.

25:13.088 --> 25:15.505
Of course,
I'm still invested.

25:15.505 --> 25:16.839
- Oh, yeah!
- Leon: Wow.

25:16.839 --> 25:18.338
- Huh? What do you think?
- Oh, yeah!

25:18.338 --> 25:20.005
- Wow. Fab.
- You like it?

25:20.005 --> 25:22.171
- I gotta check it out
in the mirror.
- Check it out.

25:22.171 --> 25:24.839
Leon:
He looks like a smart sheriff
who's also a doctor.

25:24.839 --> 25:27.213
He'll shoot you,
then he'll stitch
your ass up.

25:27.213 --> 25:29.005
Oh, my God!

25:30.463 --> 25:33.505
She took the plant!

25:33.505 --> 25:36.755
- Fuck!
- Mrs. Shapiro
took the plant!

25:36.755 --> 25:40.630
- That's fucked up.
- Oh, my God, that is insane!

25:40.630 --> 25:42.338
She didn't put
her old-ass foot
on the door,

25:42.338 --> 25:43.797
but that's still
a home invasion.

25:43.797 --> 25:45.338
Yeah. No,
I know what it is,

25:45.338 --> 25:47.672
but, I mean, she is--
you know, she's mental.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.963
- She's out of her mind.
- She didn't have to steal.

25:49.963 --> 25:52.380
A home invasion's
a fucking home invasion,
you know?

25:55.213 --> 25:56.422
That's a home invasion.

25:56.422 --> 25:58.380
She came in your house
without permission.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.505
You-- you better
get rid of the do-rag.

26:00.505 --> 26:02.839
Black man showing up
at her door with a do-rag?

26:02.839 --> 26:05.046
- She'll have a heart attack.
- ( chuckles ) She'll be fine.

26:05.046 --> 26:08.046
It's in the same family
as a scarf, as a ascot,
as a pocket square.

26:08.046 --> 26:09.547
- Same fucking family.
- I don't think

26:09.547 --> 26:11.422
that's in the scarf, ascot,
pocket square family.

26:11.422 --> 26:13.046
The same goddamn family.
Are you kidding me?

26:13.046 --> 26:15.213
( stutters )
I don't like the optics.

26:15.213 --> 26:17.839
She's gonna be fine.
I promise you, man.

26:17.839 --> 26:20.547
Fuck that.
Knock on that shit
aggressively.

26:20.547 --> 26:22.463
The hell
you give a fuck about--
this some bullshit.

26:22.463 --> 26:24.755
Oh!
What are you doing here?
Two of you?

26:24.755 --> 26:27.338
- Hey! My plant.
- Wait-- wait a minute.

26:27.338 --> 26:29.171
- ( Leon scoffs )
- That's not your plant.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.338
- Yeah.
- That's my plant.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.046
Oh, no,
it's not your plant.

26:32.046 --> 26:34.338
You came to my house
and you stole my plant.
Come on.

26:34.338 --> 26:35.630
I'm saving this plant.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.338
I'm letting it live
and flourish.

26:37.338 --> 26:39.255
- You were letting it die.
- Oh, come on.

26:39.255 --> 26:40.630
Don't give us
that green thumb shit.

26:40.630 --> 26:41.839
- ( barks )
- Oh!

26:41.839 --> 26:43.547
See, my dog
doesn't like you at all.

26:43.547 --> 26:45.589
Bella will bite you
on the ankles.

26:45.589 --> 26:48.046
I'll tell you what.
We're gonna take that dog
or this plant.

26:48.046 --> 26:50.130
Oh, no, you're not
taking my dog.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.839
- You're not touching my dog.
- What? No, you're not
taking the dog.

26:51.839 --> 26:53.297
- Why not?
- You think I want
that dog in my house?

26:53.297 --> 26:54.755
- I take the dog--
- What?

26:54.755 --> 26:56.297
- What are you, crazy?
- Why not?

26:56.297 --> 26:58.672
- Who's gonna walk it?
- We'll take turns.

26:58.672 --> 27:00.130
I'm not taking turns.

27:00.130 --> 27:02.005
I'm not walking the dog.
You gonna pick up its shit?

27:02.005 --> 27:03.797
- I'll take care of it.
- You'll take care of it?

27:03.797 --> 27:05.797
Yeah, that's what
8-year-olds say when
they wanna get a dog.

27:05.797 --> 27:07.755
"I'll take care of it."
And they don't do
a goddamn thing.

27:07.755 --> 27:09.463
See, you guys can't
even make up your minds

27:09.463 --> 27:11.755
what you're gonna do,
so why don't you just leave?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.088
Wait, who's that?

27:13.088 --> 27:15.505
That's Myron,
my dearly departed husband.

27:15.505 --> 27:17.505
You know what?
Let's take his hat.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.130
No, you're not
taking his hat.

27:19.130 --> 27:21.297
No,
take the whole goddamn head.
Take the whole fucking head.

27:21.297 --> 27:23.463
- The head? The whole head?
- The whole goddamn head.

27:23.463 --> 27:25.963
- You think I want
that head in my house?
- I don't want the fucking hat.

27:25.963 --> 27:28.255
- The hat is dumb as hell.
- I'm-- big shot, I'd rather
have the hat than the head.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.963
I'm not gonna take the head.
I don't want that monstrosity
in my house.

27:30.963 --> 27:32.547
He's a lot better-looking
than you.

27:32.547 --> 27:34.171
- Oh, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

27:34.171 --> 27:36.880
- I'm an Uber four, okay?
- Well, Myron was an Uber five.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.463
- ( barking, growling )
- ( scoffs ) He's not a five.

27:41.380 --> 27:42.755
- Hey.
- Let's get the fuck
out of here.

27:42.755 --> 27:44.380
Okay, you know what?

27:44.380 --> 27:46.130
You haven't
heard the last of me
about this, all right?

27:46.130 --> 27:48.046
Don't go into people's homes
and steal their plants.

27:48.046 --> 27:51.130
- I'll see you in court.
- The hell you will!

27:54.046 --> 27:56.422
- ( phone ringing )
- Hello?

27:56.422 --> 27:59.589
- Hi, Larry.
It's Lin Miranda.
- Oh, hey.

27:59.589 --> 28:02.046
I'm sure you heard it
from-- from Jeff already,
but I'm in.

28:02.046 --> 28:04.171
- That's great news.
- I'm clearing my schedule.

28:04.171 --> 28:07.005
It's gonna be you and me
writing this thing
toe to tip.

28:07.005 --> 28:08.839
You know what, Lin, I think
we're in pretty good shape.

28:08.839 --> 28:10.839
We don't need to get
into the weeds on this thing.

28:10.839 --> 28:14.005
- The weeds
are where the good stuff is.
- Very dangerous in the weeds.

28:14.005 --> 28:16.171
You can get
Lyme disease in there
if you're not careful.

28:16.171 --> 28:18.630
There's treasure in the weeds
and we'll pick for ticks after.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.338
The verses
are gonna be satanic.

28:21.338 --> 28:24.338
- Okay.
- Well, the other piece
of good news

28:24.338 --> 28:25.880
is that my wife, Vanessa,
and her friend

28:25.880 --> 28:27.839
are gonna be at "Hamilton"
the same night as you.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.880
- Oh.
- So, she'll be sitting
right next to you at the show.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.547
She's going?

28:32.547 --> 28:34.297
Yeah,
she's using the other half
of my house seats,

28:34.297 --> 28:36.380
so you'll be
right next to her.

28:36.380 --> 28:40.380
And, I mean,
she's gonna see you
'cause you're going.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.963
Oh, yeah.

28:41.963 --> 28:43.589
Yeah, well,
if she's going,

28:43.589 --> 28:46.005
she'll see me
because I'm going.

28:46.005 --> 28:48.130
Of course.
The ticket's for you.

28:48.130 --> 28:50.005
Yes, you got
the ticket for me

28:50.005 --> 28:52.046
and-- and I will use
the ticket you got for me,

28:52.046 --> 28:54.213
and as a result,
I-- I will be there.

28:54.213 --> 28:55.880
I'm really excited
for you guys to meet.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.046
"Fatwa!"
See you in the weeds, buddy.

28:58.046 --> 28:59.380
( phone beeps )

29:00.589 --> 29:03.005
Ah, Shucker.

29:10.921 --> 29:12.380
( knocking on door )

29:13.880 --> 29:15.589
No, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

29:15.589 --> 29:17.797
- Oh, hi.
- ( music playing, chatter )

29:17.797 --> 29:20.005
What's going on here?

29:20.005 --> 29:22.213
Oh, it's just
a little party.

29:22.213 --> 29:24.755
- How come I wasn't invited?
- To the party?

29:24.755 --> 29:26.755
Yeah,
why wasn't I invited?

29:26.755 --> 29:28.255
You just had dinner
at my house.

29:28.255 --> 29:30.547
I know.
That was so nice
and we had a great time.

29:30.547 --> 29:32.714
Okay, so how come
you're not inviting me?

29:32.714 --> 29:34.921
Where's the reciprocity?

29:34.921 --> 29:37.505
Well, I'm gonna reciprocate,
but not this one.

29:37.505 --> 29:40.755
You're gonna reciprocate?
This was the opportunity
to reciprocate.

29:40.755 --> 29:43.088
Come to the party!
I want you to come in
and really warm it up.

29:43.088 --> 29:45.130
I don't wanna go--
I don't wanna go
to the party.

29:45.130 --> 29:47.672
- Now you have to go.
- I wouldn't have come
even if I was invited.

29:47.672 --> 29:51.088
- Then what are you doing here?
- What did you tell Ted
about Tahoe?

29:51.088 --> 29:55.755
- Tahoe?
- Because, um, he told me that
you two were going to Tahoe.

29:55.755 --> 29:58.463
- We are going to Tahoe.
- And I said we had
been there.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.130
- Right.
- And he said, "Yeah, I know,"
and he snickered, okay?

30:02.130 --> 30:05.297
Leading me to believe
that you discussed it
with him.

30:05.297 --> 30:07.046
No offense to you,

30:07.046 --> 30:09.505
but Ted and I don't need
to sit around

30:09.505 --> 30:11.921
talking about
what you and I did
in hotel rooms.

30:11.921 --> 30:13.963
I just don't understand
why you're talking Tahoe
to Ted.

30:13.963 --> 30:16.547
- I wasn't talking Tahoe to Ted.
- No, you did talk Tahoe to Ted.

30:16.547 --> 30:18.463
Otherwise
there'd be no reason
for Ted to talk Tahoe.

30:18.463 --> 30:21.255
- What did he say?
- He-- he said you two
were going.

30:21.255 --> 30:24.130
So what?
That is not talking Tahoe.

30:24.130 --> 30:26.797
That is mentioning a trip
that's about to happen.

30:26.797 --> 30:28.714
- Is he here?
- No, he's shooting.

30:28.714 --> 30:30.880
More shooting?
Another job?

30:30.880 --> 30:33.255
When's it gonna end?

30:33.255 --> 30:36.630
Who's that?
Is that the Shucker?

30:36.630 --> 30:38.880
Oh, yeah.
That's the Shucker
from your party.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.630
Larry:
Ah, I gotta talk to him.

30:46.338 --> 30:48.630
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey. Yeah.

30:48.630 --> 30:50.839
I just wanna thank you
for those "Hamilton" tickets.

30:50.839 --> 30:53.422
I cannot wait.
Over the moon.

30:53.422 --> 30:56.839
Um, guess what.
I got your hat.

30:56.839 --> 30:59.672
Oh, thank God,
because I've been sick
without my hat.

30:59.672 --> 31:01.547
- Where is it?
- Yeah, it's-- it's in my car.

31:01.547 --> 31:03.755
So, um, if you can get
a little break,

31:03.755 --> 31:06.672
- we can go take a walk,
and I'll give it to you.
- Sure, that'd be great.

31:06.672 --> 31:10.255
And, uh, I got
another little thing
I wanna talk to you about.

31:10.255 --> 31:13.005
Ted is shooting
a limited series
in Vancouver.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.338
I'm borrowing your Shucker
for two minutes.

31:15.338 --> 31:17.338
Ma'am.

31:17.338 --> 31:18.755
Shucker:
There it is.

31:18.755 --> 31:23.046
- Oh, baby. ( chuckles )
- Oh, fuck.( groans )

31:23.046 --> 31:25.297
Come to Papa.

31:25.297 --> 31:28.839
Oh, I have missed you.
( clicks tongue )

31:28.839 --> 31:30.547
Well, got my hat.

31:30.547 --> 31:32.380
Thanks again
for those tickets.

31:32.380 --> 31:34.755
Yeah, that's kind of what
I wanna talk to you about.

31:34.755 --> 31:36.505
Um, Lin called me up,

31:36.505 --> 31:39.755
told me his wife
was gonna be sitting
next to me.

31:39.755 --> 31:43.630
He thinks
the tickets are for me,
and so I have to go now.

31:43.630 --> 31:47.422
So, I need--
sorry to say,
I need the tickets back.

31:47.422 --> 31:50.672
Well, what do you mean?
That's-- that's like a--
that's like a bad horse trade.

31:50.672 --> 31:54.255
- What are you talking about?
- How are you gonna show up
and sit-- sit there?

31:54.255 --> 31:55.880
Because
if she sees you there,

31:55.880 --> 31:57.839
I am gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.547
- All right.
- Come on.

32:01.547 --> 32:04.589
- All right, I'll get you
your tickets.
- Yeah?

32:04.589 --> 32:07.255
For $2,500.

32:07.255 --> 32:08.630
Take it or leave it.

32:11.005 --> 32:13.255
You're quite a prick,
aren't you?

32:13.255 --> 32:14.755
It's the Shucker's way.

32:16.755 --> 32:18.714
I don't have
that kind of cash on me.

32:18.714 --> 32:22.589
It's okay,
we take credit cards.

32:22.589 --> 32:24.213
Yeah.

32:28.297 --> 32:29.589
Thank you.

32:29.589 --> 32:31.088
Man on TV:
Jarvis isn't living up

32:31.088 --> 32:32.130
to his potential.

32:32.130 --> 32:33.589
What's on?

32:33.589 --> 32:35.088
"Chicago Teachers."

32:35.088 --> 32:36.255
- No!
- Yeah!

32:36.255 --> 32:38.380
- ( sighs )
- Oh, my God.

32:38.380 --> 32:41.921
- Oh, yeah.
- It's worse than the other
thing we were watching.

32:41.921 --> 32:43.130
They don't try
to curse that much

32:43.130 --> 32:44.297
on that one, though,
so it's okay.

32:44.297 --> 32:45.672
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.630
- Oh, that's good.
- What do you wanna do?

32:48.963 --> 32:50.338
- What do I wanna do?
- Mm-hmm.

32:50.338 --> 32:52.422
- You mean right now?
- Mm-hmm.

32:52.422 --> 32:54.255
Oh.

32:54.255 --> 32:57.963
I mean, if we could do
anything right now,

32:57.963 --> 32:59.463
what would it be?

32:59.463 --> 33:01.130
- ( smacks lips )
- Sexually.

33:01.130 --> 33:02.921
- Well...
- Mm-hmm?

33:06.880 --> 33:09.755
- Uh...
- What?

33:09.755 --> 33:11.338
- You know.
- Tell me.

33:11.338 --> 33:15.213
I just like
to get an erection,
put it in a vagina.

33:15.213 --> 33:16.505
- That's a--
- That's it?

33:16.505 --> 33:17.714
That's about it, yeah.

33:17.714 --> 33:20.005
That's your
biggest fantasy?

33:20.005 --> 33:22.297
I would just
get on the top

33:22.297 --> 33:26.130
and thrust
until orgasm.

33:26.130 --> 33:29.463
- Hmm.
- I'm sexually
a very simple man.

33:29.463 --> 33:31.213
Oh.

33:31.213 --> 33:33.672
Hmm.

33:33.672 --> 33:39.672
- But there is something
that can change that.
- Oh.

33:39.672 --> 33:41.672
- I got something.
I got something...
- There we go.

33:41.672 --> 33:44.213
- Ooh! Oh!
- ...that's
pretty interesting.

33:47.839 --> 33:51.755
- There you go.
- ( chuckling )

33:51.755 --> 33:57.839
This is a relationship
nondisclosure agreement?

33:57.839 --> 34:00.005
- Yeah.
- Is this a joke?

34:00.005 --> 34:01.422
No, no.

34:01.422 --> 34:05.171
You-- this is
a nondisclosure agreement

34:05.171 --> 34:08.297
that you want me to sign?

34:08.297 --> 34:10.213
Yeah, we both--
we both have to sign it.

34:10.213 --> 34:13.672
This is terrible!
This is-- what's wrong
with you?

34:13.672 --> 34:16.921
It's-- it's just
a discretion thing.
You know, it's a--

34:16.921 --> 34:19.380
"Partners prohibited
from disclosing the quality
of the sexual experience

34:19.380 --> 34:21.505
or the degree
of satisfaction attained"?

34:21.505 --> 34:24.255
- It's fairly boilerplate.
- There is no boilerplate,
Larry.

34:24.255 --> 34:25.839
This has never
existed before.

34:25.839 --> 34:28.046
- This is insane.
- I know, it's brilliant.

34:28.046 --> 34:31.046
- It's not brilliant.
- It locks in discretion, it's--

34:31.046 --> 34:32.630
"Partners shall not
divulge any details

34:32.630 --> 34:34.963
including the use of toys,
lotions, ointments..."

34:34.963 --> 34:36.797
What are you
talking about?

34:36.797 --> 34:38.880
- Fantastic idea.
- Larry, you are out
of your mind.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.213
- No, uh--
- This is horrible.

34:40.213 --> 34:41.963
It'll be great
for our sex life.

34:41.963 --> 34:43.839
- We can-- we can go wild.
- No, it won't.

34:43.839 --> 34:46.380
This is a great idea.
I-- I wish I thought of it
years ago!

34:46.380 --> 34:48.839
I wish
my ex-wife had signed one,
I can tell you that!

34:48.839 --> 34:50.921
'Cause I know she's talking,
she's blabbing.

34:50.921 --> 34:52.714
She's telling
Ted Danson everything.

34:52.714 --> 34:54.171
What happened in Tahoe--

34:54.171 --> 34:56.088
she's told him
what happened in Tahoe!

34:56.088 --> 34:57.797
You're presenting me
with a legal document.

34:57.797 --> 35:00.880
It's the least sexy thing
anyone has ever done, ever!

35:00.880 --> 35:02.380
- It's like a prenup!
- Bye.

35:02.380 --> 35:03.714
You're not thinking
this through!

35:03.714 --> 35:07.797
This is a good-- good idea!
Bridget! Bridget!

35:07.797 --> 35:10.880
Bridget, if we had this,
it'll take the boredom away!

35:10.880 --> 35:14.005
Sign this and you'll
have the wildest sex
you ever imagined!

35:14.005 --> 35:15.255
- No.
- Just sign it!

35:15.255 --> 35:17.589
- No.
- Orgasms galore!

35:17.589 --> 35:19.505
That's what
I'm promising you, baby!

35:19.505 --> 35:22.255
Orgasms galore!
You won't regret it!

35:22.255 --> 35:24.714
I'm not signing
your dumb piece of paper,
Larry.

35:24.714 --> 35:26.463
Should've known
this was not gonna work out.

35:26.463 --> 35:27.921
Eddie never liked you!

35:27.921 --> 35:30.589
Oh, the-- the kid
you pretended has Asperger's?

35:30.589 --> 35:33.589
It is not pretend.
He has Asperger's.

35:33.589 --> 35:35.088
What's your excuse?

35:38.171 --> 35:39.422
( sighs )

35:41.297 --> 35:44.755
( tapping )
You're missing out
on Tahoe Larry!

35:46.589 --> 35:49.213
( music playing )

35:49.213 --> 35:50.880
Announcer:
You are about to enter

35:50.880 --> 35:54.505
the courtroom
of Judge Judith Sheindlin.

35:54.505 --> 35:57.630
This is "Judge Judy."

35:57.630 --> 36:00.463
Larry David
is suing Rose Shapiro

36:00.463 --> 36:05.130
for trespassing at his home
and stealing his ficus plant.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.963
Larry David says
that Mrs. Shapiro

36:07.963 --> 36:10.880
has made him feel unsafe
in his own home.

36:10.880 --> 36:13.297
The defendant
is countersuing Mr. David

36:13.297 --> 36:18.005
for sole custody of the plant
on grounds of plant abuse.

36:18.005 --> 36:19.672
Petri:
All rise.

36:19.672 --> 36:22.005
Oh, my God.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.338
Your Honor, it's case number 249
on the calendar in the matter
of David vs. Shapiro.

36:25.338 --> 36:26.839
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Judge.

36:26.839 --> 36:28.672
Parties have been sworn in.
You may be seated.

36:28.672 --> 36:32.755
Oh, my fucking God!

36:32.755 --> 36:34.963
- Judy: When was that?
- Five years ago.

36:34.963 --> 36:37.213
Subsequently,
several weeks ago,

36:37.213 --> 36:39.672
you, without invitation,

36:39.672 --> 36:41.714
- came into the house.
- Oh...

36:41.714 --> 36:43.422
( chuckles )
That's him!

36:43.422 --> 36:45.005
That's the guy.
That's the guy I was
telling you about.

36:45.005 --> 36:47.547
This is the guy you had
all those sex stories about?

36:47.547 --> 36:50.297
Yes, that's
Larry Long Balls.

36:50.297 --> 36:51.797
Finally,
I shoo her away.

36:51.797 --> 36:53.755
She comes back
another time, uninvited,

36:53.755 --> 36:55.714
uses her key,
steals the plant.

36:55.714 --> 36:59.422
Miss Shapiro, I see that
you have some evidence here.

36:59.422 --> 37:02.046
This is the way
the plant looked

37:02.046 --> 37:04.297
- when I found it in his house.
- ( courtroom gasps )

37:04.297 --> 37:06.630
- I wanna object.
Objection.
- Larry: Yeah.

37:06.630 --> 37:08.547
- Total objection to that plant.
- Judy: Just a second.

37:08.547 --> 37:10.088
Who are you?

37:10.088 --> 37:12.714
This is Leon Black.
He's-- he's my witness.

37:12.714 --> 37:14.714
Does he have
any relevant information

37:14.714 --> 37:17.422
that would help--
that would help your case?

37:17.422 --> 37:20.088
I do.
This plant
is like a person.

37:20.088 --> 37:24.171
Certain parts of the year,
that plant turns darker,
like myself.

37:24.171 --> 37:27.463
When I go to Florida,
I turn a little darker,
a shade darker.

37:27.463 --> 37:29.714
Most of the time I carry myself
in a mocha tone,

37:29.714 --> 37:32.880
but there are some--
some parts of the year
when I'm more mahogany.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.921
Let's get finished
with the various tones
of Mr. Black

37:35.921 --> 37:37.505
and let's move on
to something else.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.463
Your Honor,
is it possible
I could pace

37:39.463 --> 37:41.338
while you're asking me
the questions?

37:41.338 --> 37:45.088
Would you put him
in his seat?

37:45.088 --> 37:47.672
- Mrs. Shapiro.
- Rose: Yes?

37:47.672 --> 37:49.963
You have another exhibit
underneath that

37:49.963 --> 37:51.839
to show me what the plant
looks like now?

37:51.839 --> 37:54.921
- Yes, I do.
- Larry: Anybody want
a cough drop?

37:54.921 --> 37:56.921
You want one, Judge?
Judge Sheindlin?

37:56.921 --> 37:58.338
You want a cough drop?

37:58.338 --> 38:00.171
It's so hard to be fair.

38:00.171 --> 38:02.005
Byrd, give her
a cough drop.

38:02.005 --> 38:04.005
So, this is the guy
you're working with?

38:04.005 --> 38:05.755
- Judy: Go-- shh! Uh!
- Yeah.

38:05.755 --> 38:07.755
Judy:
You went back
to Mr. David's home...

38:07.755 --> 38:09.921
- ( water pouring )
- ...and you stole the plant.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.338
I would say rather
than stole, rescued.

38:12.338 --> 38:14.589
Judge, yoo-hoo!
Is this filtered?

38:14.589 --> 38:16.714
I don't know.
What is he asking me?

38:16.714 --> 38:18.630
- Petri:
If it's filtered, Judge.
- It's...

38:18.630 --> 38:20.213
- Larry: Is it filtered?
- Yes, it's filtered.

38:20.213 --> 38:22.839
I'm sorry.
That is not filtered water.

38:22.839 --> 38:25.297
Don't drink it.
Don't drink it.
Put it down.

38:25.297 --> 38:27.839
What are you
putting unfiltered water--
tap water on the table for?

38:27.839 --> 38:30.130
That's it. That's it.
I'm done.

38:30.130 --> 38:32.630
Mr. David,
while I understand

38:32.630 --> 38:34.839
that Mrs. Shapiro
did the wrong thing,

38:34.839 --> 38:37.088
I can only say
to you, sir,

38:37.088 --> 38:39.297
that anyone who would
neglect a plant

38:39.297 --> 38:41.921
in that fashion
doesn't deserve to have it.

38:41.921 --> 38:43.963
- Your case is dismissed.
- ( gavel pounds )

38:43.963 --> 38:45.505
We're done.
There you go.

38:45.505 --> 38:47.255
- This is-- what?
- Good-bye.

38:47.255 --> 38:48.921
Petri:
Parties are excused.
You may step out.

38:48.921 --> 38:51.839
This is crazy!
I'm-- I'm shocked, shocked!

38:51.839 --> 38:54.589
Are we no better than the--
the beasts in the field?

38:54.589 --> 38:57.963
And by beasts,
I'm not talking about
the-- the chicken.

38:57.963 --> 39:01.130
I'm talking about the oxen
and the-- the donkey...

39:01.130 --> 39:04.255
- Oh, un-fucking-believable.
- ...with its slack-jawed
stare and...

39:04.255 --> 39:05.921
- What's going on?
- Susie: Oh, nothing.

39:05.921 --> 39:08.630
- ( TV turns off )
- Come on into bed, cowboy.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.505
( toothbrush clatters )

39:10.505 --> 39:12.005
Yes, ma'am.

39:13.755 --> 39:15.755
( chatter )

39:15.755 --> 39:17.505
( horn honking )

39:31.338 --> 39:32.714
Forget it, forget it.

39:34.921 --> 39:36.921
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:36.921 --> 39:38.130
- Hello.
- Vanessa.

39:38.130 --> 39:39.839
- Hi, Vanessa.
- So nice to meet you.

39:39.839 --> 39:42.213
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Larry David.
- Hi, Larry, yeah.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.255
Hi. I'm bald, I wear glasses,
and-- and this is my ticket.

39:45.255 --> 39:47.547
- ( chuckles )
- Here to see the show.
I'm very excited.

39:47.547 --> 39:49.338
I'm right here.
I'm sitting right
next to you.

39:49.338 --> 39:50.755
- How about that?
- Yeah.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.046
This is my friend,
Joanna, from college.

39:53.046 --> 39:54.213
- Hi.
- Hello, hi.

39:54.213 --> 39:55.797
- Larry.
- Nice to meet you.

39:55.797 --> 39:57.297
I'm not a shucker.

39:57.297 --> 39:59.505
- ( Joanna chuckles )
- I enjoy clams. I do.

39:59.505 --> 40:01.547
I like oysters,
but I don't shuck.

40:01.547 --> 40:03.963
I know a shucker,
but that doesn't mean

40:03.963 --> 40:05.547
that the shucker's
gonna be here.

40:05.547 --> 40:06.921
I'm here,
not the shucker.

40:06.921 --> 40:08.963
Do you like clams
and oysters?

40:08.963 --> 40:10.547
- They're okay.
- Yeah, okay.

40:10.547 --> 40:12.839
Well, but if you eat them,
somebody's gotta shuck them.

40:12.839 --> 40:15.547
Lin is so excited
about "Fatwa!"

40:15.547 --> 40:18.505
- Oh, "Fatwa!"
Come on!
- Yeah.

40:18.505 --> 40:20.380
This is gonna be
a big thing, though.

40:20.380 --> 40:21.547
He's so excited.

40:21.547 --> 40:23.213
He can't wait
to just get in there

40:23.213 --> 40:24.921
and start rewriting.

40:24.921 --> 40:26.880
He shouldn't be
getting into there,

40:26.880 --> 40:28.338
he should be
getting into you,

40:28.338 --> 40:29.672
and I don't mean that
in a sexual way.

40:29.672 --> 40:31.297
I mean it
in terms of time.

40:31.297 --> 40:32.921
Don't-- don't get
into the weeds of the show.

40:32.921 --> 40:35.005
Get into your weeds,
again not sexual,

40:35.005 --> 40:37.589
but delve into you,
you know.

40:37.589 --> 40:39.338
And again,
delve into you--

40:39.338 --> 40:42.255
nonsexual delving
is what I'm saying.

40:42.255 --> 40:44.422
A nonsexual delve.

40:44.422 --> 40:46.547
Ay, gosh.

40:46.547 --> 40:48.422
Shoulder.
Killing me.

40:48.422 --> 40:50.297
How'd you hurt
your shoulder?

40:50.297 --> 40:53.589
Wrestling with Lin
in his agent's office.

40:53.589 --> 40:56.755
- He threw me to the ground.
- Seriously?

40:56.755 --> 40:58.422
Yeah, yeah.

40:58.422 --> 40:59.589
( chuckles )

41:03.672 --> 41:06.130
I've got pain pills.
My friend gave me pain pills.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.422
- Fantastic!
- You want some water?

41:09.422 --> 41:11.921
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

41:19.630 --> 41:21.130
Oh, you can keep it.
