00:02.794 --> 00:04.379
- How's the meal?
- Tasty.

00:04.463 --> 00:05.714
Very tasty. New cook?

00:05.797 --> 00:08.675
Yes, Marisella. She's introduced us
to some wonderful dishes...

00:08.759 --> 00:10.719
so charmingly specific
to her native country.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.639
- What country is she from?
- A little one, next to Mexico.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.265
- How charmingly specific.
- Too bad Grandpa's not here.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.394
- He likes weird food.
- Where's he eating his weird food tonight?

00:19.478 --> 00:21.355
- Argentina? Morocco?
- Akron.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.648
- Ohio?
- Yes.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.234
- Get out of here.
- I will not 'get out of here. '

00:25.317 --> 00:27.236
No, I didn't mean really get out of here.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.029
- Why is Grandpa in Akron?
- I don't know.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.322
It was just a saying.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.575
They sent him to deal with a problem
with their local office.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.953
A saying, like 'save me,'
or 'get me out of here. '

00:36.036 --> 00:37.829
Would you like a mirror in front of you...

00:37.913 --> 00:40.082
so you can see yourself
during this conversation.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.917
- Sorry. Dad's in Akron.
- Yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.838
The amenities are atrociously lacking.
He had to eat at a coffee shop last night.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.090
The whole thing's insulting.
He's miserable.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.217
- I hate that he's miserable.
- So do I.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.427
- We ought to do something.
- Yes, I agree.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.679
Warning, warning.

00:53.762 --> 00:57.099
I'm glad you said that. I thought of
a wonderful way to cheer him up.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.434
- Cool. What?
- Danger, Will Robinson, danger!

00:59.518 --> 01:01.645
An oil portrait of you for his study.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.188
- An oil portrait?
- I tried. Have fun.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.900
It could hang right over his mantel.
He'd just love it.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.110
I guess that would be okay.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.071
- Mom, please don't make her do this.
- She just said she would.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.366
Fine, but don't make her sit
and pose for it. Paint it from a photo.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.870
- A photo? That's what they do at malls.
- I'll sit. It's fine.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.415
Just because your experience was bad
doesn't mean Rory's has to be.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.126
- What portrait? I haven't seen this.
- They never finished.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.336
Three painters started,
and they all three quit.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.505
- Why did they quit?
- She wouldn't stop scowling.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.257
I was going for a Billy Idol thing.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.342
The one from Italy
had some sort of breakdown.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.678
It didn't hurt Van Gogh.
The guy should thank me.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.056
A year later, I swear I saw him
rummaging through our recyclables.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.684
Well, I'm happy to sit.
If it's for Grandpa, why not?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.687
Wonderful. I'll set it up
first thing in the morning.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.106
If you want, I can teach you the Billy Idol.

01:46.190 --> 01:50.110
Most people focus on the lip thing,
but the eyes are just as important...

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.001 --> 02:50.796
So, first thing you and Sookie would do
is incorporate.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.297
Wow. Sounds so bigtime.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.008
Not really. It just means
you're a single business entity.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.010
You'll both be officers and shareholders...

02:57.094 --> 02:59.304
and you'll get to
make up a name for your company.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.640
I'm terrible at coming up with names.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.476
When we first bought our house,
Rory and I wanted to name it.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.728
Like Jefferson
named his place Monticello...

03:06.812 --> 03:08.856
but we could only come up with
'The Crap Shack. '

03:08.939 --> 03:10.315
- Nice.
- Coffee?

03:10.399 --> 03:11.900
Yeah, thanks.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.112
- How are you, Jess?
- I'm not bleeding or anything.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.989
Then it's gonna be a good day.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.323
- 7:45.
- So?

03:18.365 --> 03:21.827
You want me to go to school, or you want
to openly defy child-labor laws?

03:21.869 --> 03:22.911
Go.

03:23.954 --> 03:24.955
Stay out of trouble.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.791
I guess I'll call off
the chickie run at the salt flats.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.794
- Out!
- Wow. So much love.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.838
Do you guys have a site in mind
for the inn?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.047
- Yes.
- Great. Where?

03:34.131 --> 03:36.216
You've seen pictures of it.
The Rachel property.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.301
Right.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.677
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.181
Rachel took the pictures, and the pictures
kind of got us into the place.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.308
So we started calling it
the Rachel property...

03:44.391 --> 03:47.060
because it made sense,
and then it became a habit.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.147
Now, out of respect for you,
I'm gonna stop using her name...

03:50.230 --> 03:53.859
and think of another name to call it.
Let's see. 'The Crap Shack' is taken.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.485
It's okay. Call it what you want.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.238
Who taught you
about all this business stuff? Your dad?

03:58.322 --> 04:01.575
My dad didn't have a checking account
till I got taller than he was.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.745
He bought this land with cash,
built this place himself.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.039
Didn't have a bookkeeper,
accountant, or anything.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.832
So you had no one showing you the ropes.

04:08.916 --> 04:12.211
I figured I had to dive in on my own,
fail if that's my destiny...

04:12.252 --> 04:16.089
- and forget what the experts say.
- That is exactly my philosophy. Exactly.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.634
Except I'm not on my own,
I'm diving in with Sookie.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.011
And failure is not even a choice
of destinies.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.555
And I'm consulting any expert
who will listen to me.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.349
Otherwise, it's identical.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.477
I should be getting going.
You gonna write this meal off?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.604
- Why?
- We talked business.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.481
You gotta be thinking about these things.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.359
No, I mean, 'Why? I'm not paying for it. '

04:35.442 --> 04:37.736
- Exactly.
- You're gonna do fine.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.906
It shouldn't be too flashy.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.450
How about something historical,
like 'The Paul Revere'?

04:43.534 --> 04:45.035
- That could work.
- What could work?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.703
We're thinking up names for the inn.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.456
If you want simple,
something like 'The Country Rose. '

04:49.540 --> 04:50.541
That's pretty good.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.085
We could line the front path
with multicolored roses.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.878
Or 'The Inn by the Hollow. '

04:54.962 --> 04:56.213
- Kind of long.
- But nice.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.216
How about 'The Money Pit'?
Or 'The Outhouse'? Go international.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.425
Go back in your hole.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.262
Or 'The Inn Heading for Bankruptcy'?
Kind of long, but nice.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.347
You who have no dreams,
rain on those who do.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.600
I say this because I care about you.
It's risky, what you are doing.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.727
Most new businesses
go down within two years.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.437
I say if we go down after two years...

05:12.521 --> 05:14.731
it'll be the most exciting two years
of our lives.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.276
- Same here. Boredom stinks!
- Fine. Proceed blindly.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.652
This came in 10 minutes ago.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.571
It does not involve The Independence Inn.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.699
Therefore, delivering it was
beyond my official obligations...

05:23.782 --> 05:26.577
so I am taking an extra-long lunch break.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.245
He's so genuine.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.913
- Oh, my God.
- What?

05:29.997 --> 05:33.041
It's the title search for
the Rachel property. Guess who owns it?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.960
Tell me it's
not that bastard Donald Trump.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.920
- Fran.
- Fran from Westin Bakery?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.714
Sweet little Fran, the cupcake lady.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.258
Not some cigar-chomping,
dirty-dealing city slicker.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.636
That's good. Hey, 'The Country Slicker. '
Funny name, cutesy idea.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.430
- It's a little much.
- It's way too much.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.015
- I'll call Fran.
- 'Fran's Old Place. '

05:48.098 --> 05:49.725
It'll be like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.894
People will be
trying to figure out who Fran is.

05:51.977 --> 05:56.398
Or 'The In Inn'
It's an inn that's in with the in-crowd.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.985
- I'm gonna go sit down.
- Do that, sweetie.

06:15.334 --> 06:18.629
Honey, I am so sorry.
Am I late-late, or just late?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.506
Two pieces of carrot cake and a rum ball.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.133
I'm so sorry.
I swear, I meant to be on time.

06:23.217 --> 06:26.845
I was prepping the raspberry glaze
for tonight's dessert, and it struck me:

06:26.929 --> 06:31.183
I made a blueberry glaze for the soufflÃ©
I made last Tuesday, and this is Tuesday.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.311
And a lot of locals come every week
on the same night every week.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.022
And I just didn't want to serve them
a similar dessert...

06:37.105 --> 06:39.149
even though
it's a completely different berry.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.109
- I need another rum ball.
- I'm sorry.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.111
No, you're a perfectionist.

06:43.195 --> 06:46.281
And that attention to detail
is why people call you 'the maestro. '

06:46.365 --> 06:49.910
- Really? Who calls me that?
- The people who eat the rum balls.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.745
So, ladies, how are we doing here?

06:51.828 --> 06:54.414
- We're doing great, Fran.
- That's wonderful.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.875
Could Sookie and I talk to you
for a couple minutes?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.545
Of course. Marjorie can handle things.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.632
- Fran, are you okay?
- It's this bum hip.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.218
It needs to be replaced. Again.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.221
And I have this awful angina.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.056
We're so sorry to hear that.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.268
So, I know you didn't come here
to listen to me gripe...

07:14.351 --> 07:16.019
so tell me what's on your mind.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.522
Fran, we understand that you own...

07:18.605 --> 07:21.733
the old Dragonfly bed-and-breakfast,
that whole property out there.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.444
Yes, I do. It was my parents' business.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.988
It's a beautiful place.

07:26.071 --> 07:29.741
It used to be. But it's in such disarray now.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.035
Yes, it is. That's kind of why we're here.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.955
- We'd actually like to buy it.
- Buy the Dragonfly?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.249
We'd like to buy it
and make it beautiful again...

07:37.291 --> 07:39.543
and we're prepared
to make you an offer right now.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.753
My, this is a surprise.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.131
Sookie and I are going
to start our own inn...

07:44.214 --> 07:46.717
and we've been searching
for the perfect place.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.594
- Your own inn?
- Yeah.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.929
How wonderful!

07:51.263 --> 07:53.807
You are going to be so successful.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.100
Thanks, sweetie.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.769
That means so much,
like we have your blessing.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.897
But I can't sell you the property.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.064
- What?
- How come?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.733
I just couldn't.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.111
You know, I have no siblings
and no children...

08:06.445 --> 08:10.824
and, in a way, that place
is really the only family I have.

08:11.617 --> 08:15.704
I'm the last Westin left,
so I plan to own it forever.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.748
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.667
- That's a very long time.
- A very long time.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.544
I'm so sorry.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.379
Fran, may I ask...

08:26.215 --> 08:28.759
Go ahead, honey,
ask me anything you want.

08:28.842 --> 08:33.054
What happens to the place if you...
If forever isn't quite forever?

08:33.138 --> 08:37.851
I don't understand, dear.
All I know is that I can't sell the place.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.811
No, I don't mean selling it.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.190
I mean you would keep it forever,
but what happens...

08:43.273 --> 08:46.985
once you're no longer in the position
of physically controlling the property?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.320
How could that be?

08:48.362 --> 08:51.990
- Well, if you...
- Take a long vacation.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.660
- Yes, take a long vacation. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.872
And when you're on that vacation,
the property is just left sitting there.

08:58.956 --> 09:02.417
- What happens then?
- I don't enjoy vacations.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.213
I toured the California Gold Country
10 years ago.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.507
It was hot, and the bus smelled.

09:08.549 --> 09:13.345
Okay. I mean a longer vacation
than a trip to California.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.931
- To a different place.
- What kind of place?

09:16.014 --> 09:18.350
- A place out there.
- Way out there, Fran.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.685
Europe?

09:19.768 --> 09:23.981
- I mean, the ultimate long vacation.
- Yeah, Fran, see, eventually...

09:24.022 --> 09:27.317
we're all gonna take
the same long vacation.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.111
And with that being the case...

09:29.194 --> 09:32.865
you might want to sell the property now
and enjoy the money.

09:32.948 --> 09:37.369
I'm very sorry,
but I can never sell the place.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.707
- Thanks for your time, Fran.
- Yeah, thanks, Fran.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.876
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

09:48.505 --> 09:52.759
You both look so sad.
Would you like a cupcake?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.511
- Please.
- Yeah.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.890
So, Janie Fertman's
trying to be my friend again.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.892
Yikes. What kind of vibe
were you giving her?

09:59.975 --> 10:03.395
My patented Keith Richards, circa 1969,
don't-mess-with-me vibe...

10:03.478 --> 10:07.024
- with a 1000-yard Asian stare thrown in.
- That should do it.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.276
What's happening up there?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.321
Just try to calm down, Taylor.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.574
- Calm down? Why should I calm down?
- Yeah, why should he calm down?

10:15.657 --> 10:18.452
- I want action, not words!
- Yeah, action, not words.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.454
Don't you need
to get back to your newsstand?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.538
No, I'm all yours.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.415
We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise.

10:23.499 --> 10:26.168
A crime was committed
right in front of my store!

10:26.251 --> 10:30.047
- We can't say that for sure yet.
- How come you can't say that for sure?

10:30.088 --> 10:32.799
This is a police tape.
You're the police. You own the tape.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.595
We've contacted everyone in the precinct.
No one knows anything about this.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.932
What do I do? I've got
a dead body right in front of my store!

10:39.973 --> 10:43.268
No, you have a chalk outline
of a dead body in front of your store.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.270
- Meaning that there were two crimes.
- What?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.396
What do you mean, 'What?'

10:46.480 --> 10:48.774
Somebody got murdered,
then somebody stole the body.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.442
It's open-and-shut. Bing, bang, boom!

10:50.526 --> 10:52.945
- Is this your son?
- I should say not!

10:52.986 --> 10:56.573
Look, my partner's doing a head count
to see if anybody in town is missing.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.492
Until then, just hang tight.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.827
What's going on?

11:00.911 --> 11:03.163
I don't know. I got here,
and this is what I found.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.541
I told him it looked fake,
but he didn't believe me.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.459
And you have such an honest face.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.294
He must not love me as much as you do.

11:09.378 --> 11:12.089
Okay, you two are officially sickening.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.301
Everyone's accounted for.
Looks like this is just an elaborate prank.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.637
It looks so real.
Where'd they get the police tape?

11:18.720 --> 11:19.763
Kids have their ways.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.891
Who'd be depraved enough
to pull a stupid prank like this?

11:22.975 --> 11:24.351
Hard to say.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.822
You're not writing what you purchased
on the back of these receipts.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.867
- Just put 'cooking spray and sponges. '
- Okay.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.662
When an auditor wants to know why
you need such large amounts of those?

11:43.745 --> 11:46.081
I drop my pencil,
and put the scoop-neck sweater...

11:46.165 --> 11:48.584
that I'm making a mental note to wear,
to good use.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.377
At least you've got a solid plan.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.838
I had a dream last night about us and Fran.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.964
What was it?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.175
It was in the future, and we were all old:

11:56.216 --> 12:01.180
You, me, Rory, Jackson, Michel, everyone,
gray hair, walking around with canes...

12:01.263 --> 12:04.558
and we're all kind of ailing.
I had those big cataract glasses on.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.727
You were hard of hearing.
You kept going, 'Huh?'

12:06.810 --> 12:09.396
- Attractive.
- It's you kids with your rock 'n' roll.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.482
But what, ho! Here walks up Fran.
And guess what?

12:12.566 --> 12:15.861
- She looks exactly the same, even better.
- That's not fair.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.487
That woman is gonna live forever.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.157
Not necessarily.
Did you look up angina? I forgot to.

12:20.199 --> 12:21.325
Yeah, it's nothing major.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.660
- Guys, stop talking like this.
- Like what?

12:23.744 --> 12:25.579
We love Fran, remember? Fran is great.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.164
No, of course we love Fran.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.667
We just want to know
what God's plan is for her, that's all.

12:30.751 --> 12:35.088
I would advise at least pretending
to look busy. The boss is here.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.926
- You're kidding. When?
- I just spotted her walking in.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.260
Let's go.

12:41.512 --> 12:42.721
Mia!

12:43.597 --> 12:45.265
My babies!

12:46.391 --> 12:48.685
- Did we know you were coming?
- I didn't know.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.689
- This isn't a surprise inspection?
- That's exactly what this is. Ready?

12:53.148 --> 12:55.192
- You're too thin, as always.
- But we eat.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.527
And you're both too beautiful.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.780
We often feel guilty monopolizing
the amount of beauty we possess.

12:59.863 --> 13:03.617
I don't see you enough,
which is my fault, so you both pass.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.539
Michel. How nice to see you.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.834
And look at that suit.
You are quite the dandy, aren't you?

13:11.917 --> 13:15.420
I had a feeling that a lovely woman
was going to be visiting today...

13:15.504 --> 13:18.340
so I decided I must look my best for her.

13:19.049 --> 13:22.177
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch a word of that.
- He said he missed you.

13:22.261 --> 13:27.099
You've been in the US quite some time.
Your enunciation should be better by now.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.019
The customers
seem to understand me just fine.

13:31.103 --> 13:34.773
I didn't get that, either.
Did you get the tapes I sent you?

13:34.815 --> 13:37.526
You should hit the desk.
People are looking for help.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.320
Right away. Mia, I...

13:43.490 --> 13:46.285
So are you too busy
to sneak out with me for a walk?

13:46.368 --> 13:49.037
- If it's okay with the boss.
- It's a demand at this point.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.165
Let's go. Michel, hold down the fort.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.251
It's a little slow now, so it's no problem.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.171
He says he's never liked you
and that you're a problem.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.047
I said no such thing!

13:59.131 --> 14:02.718
I don't know where this hostility
comes from. Can we work this out?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.469
There is nothing to work out.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.930
- He told you to get out.
- I did not!

14:07.014 --> 14:09.892
I don't know what I did
to make him hate me.

14:14.188 --> 14:18.984
- Look at this place. Exactly the same.
- I made him paint it a few months ago.

14:19.026 --> 14:23.113
Well, good for you. Nice to see you, Lucas.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.657
You're the only person
that can call me that, Mia.

14:25.741 --> 14:26.783
I know this.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.077
I'm saying it for others
who plan to try it later.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.787
Whatever, Lucas.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.582
- Mia, you know anything about toasters?
- Not a damn thing.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.668
Then, sit down
and let me get you some coffee.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.297
So, Mia, how's living in Santa Barbara?

14:40.339 --> 14:43.258
Horrible. Did you know the sun
shines all the time out there?

14:43.342 --> 14:44.760
They've written songs about that.

14:44.843 --> 14:48.472
No one told me that's how it was.
Half my wardrobe is obsolete.

14:48.514 --> 14:51.934
- Drag. You know that blue coat?
- You're not getting it.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.480
- You're making that worse.
- Big help. Thanks.

14:56.522 --> 14:57.898
Luke's nephew.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.817
- Luke, that's your nephew?
- It's Liz's kid.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.904
Jess, this is Mia.
She owns the Independence Inn.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.740
That's, 'Hello, nice to meet you,'
in slacker.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.076
You don't need me down here, do you?

15:09.159 --> 15:10.452
I'm sorry, Mia. He's just...

15:10.536 --> 15:15.207
Please, forget it. You weren't exactly
talkative yourself when you were his age.

15:15.290 --> 15:19.002
- That's right. You knew Luke as a boy.
- I can't imagine Luke as a boy.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.379
Can we change the subject?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.589
He would help people
carry groceries home.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.342
- How very Boy Scouty of you.
- For a quarter a bag.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.970
How very John Birch Society of you.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.055
He was never without his skateboard
for a time.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.182
- Were you any good?
- I could hold my own.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.435
There was that year you wore
the same shirt everywhere you went.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.771
- I don't remember that.
- Maybe something flannel.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.732
No, it was from that TV show,
that famous one.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.318
- It's not important.
- Star Trek. That's it.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.571
- Oh, my God.
- Stop it.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.990
- You were a Trekkie?
- I was not a Trekkie.

15:48.073 --> 15:51.910
I believe denying you were a Trekkie
is a violation of the Prime Directive.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.203
Indubitably, Captain.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.789
It was a gift from my aunt.
I wore it to make her happy.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.875
I've never wanted
to make any aunt that happy.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.461
- Did I say something I shouldn't have?
- I have to cancel everything...

16:01.545 --> 16:05.340
scheduled for the next three months,
'cause I'll still be laughing my ass off.

16:05.424 --> 16:08.552
- Luke, I need to talk to you right now.
- What is it, Taylor?

16:08.594 --> 16:11.430
I have conducted a thorough investigation
of all the people...

16:11.513 --> 16:14.391
who may have inadvertently been witness
to the phony murder...

16:14.433 --> 16:16.018
at my store last night.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.728
There was a phony murder?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.771
The town's too dull
to work up a real murder.

16:19.813 --> 16:23.150
You're one 'Beam me up, Scotty'
reference away from being the victim.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.903
- Are you gonna listen?
- What's this got to do with me?

16:25.944 --> 16:30.532
Three people have reported seeing Jess in
that area late last night, skulking, lurking.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.451
There were a lot of people out last night.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.662
I fed them. I'll give you their names
to add to your suspect list.

16:35.746 --> 16:39.625
A person witnessed Jess walking out
of an arts-and-crafts store two days ago...

16:39.708 --> 16:42.794
- with what appeared to be chalk.
- You appear to be bugging me.

16:42.878 --> 16:44.963
- What are you gonna do about it?
- About what?

16:45.047 --> 16:48.509
- About the results of my investigation.
- Nothing, but thanks for the info.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.928
You have to do something.
People want action.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.514
- People? Meaning you.
- Not just me.

16:53.597 --> 16:56.308
I speak for the Stars Hollow
Business Association...

16:56.350 --> 16:59.436
the Stars Hollow Tourist Board,
Neighborhood Watch Organization...

16:59.520 --> 17:02.481
and the Stars Hollow Citizens
for a Clean Stars Hollow Council.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.317
- All of which are you.
- So are you going to act?

17:05.400 --> 17:08.945
- I'm gonna act like you never came in here.
- Fine, have it your own way.

17:08.987 --> 17:12.991
But I warn you, there's gonna be a lot
of unhappy people at the SHBA...

17:13.075 --> 17:17.871
the SHTB, the SHMWO, and the SHCCHSC.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.164
F- I-N-E!

17:19.623 --> 17:22.501
You are impossible!

17:26.003 --> 17:28.382
- Hi, Mia.
- Nice to see you, Taylor.

17:30.926 --> 17:35.639
I've got to get out of Santa Barbara.
I miss the small-town theater.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.683
And I miss you.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.186
Do you realize it was 15 years ago,
almost to the day?

17:41.270 --> 17:42.521
- Yes, it was.
- What was?

17:42.563 --> 17:46.316
To the day when this skinny
little teenage girl showed up at the inn.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.652
She had this tiny little thing in her arms.

17:48.694 --> 17:52.489
- A little thing named Rory.
- Okay, no physical re-enactment.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.992
You marched up to me,
looked me in the eye, and said:

17:55.033 --> 17:56.952
'I'm here for a job. Any job. '

17:57.035 --> 18:00.247
Well, IBM had turned me down
for the CEO slot, so I was desperate.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.709
Work experience, none.
Recommendations, none. Skills...

18:03.750 --> 18:06.837
Besides flawlessly applying mascara
in a moving car, none.

18:06.879 --> 18:09.798
Not one thing to recommend hiring her.
Just that...

18:09.882 --> 18:13.969
How do I put it and remain a lady?
That 'who cares?' look in her eye.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.139
So I gave her any job.
The other maids hated you.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.850
- Well, they were so slow.
- You were special.

18:19.892 --> 18:21.894
Why don't you move back here?
We miss you.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.521
Or at least visit more.
You never come at all.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.940
I don't have to.
You've made me redundant.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.234
- I have not.
- Don't be humble.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.069
The inn is beyond covered.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.655
It's never run this well
or been this successful.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.574
That inn is like your place now.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.452
Without you, I wouldn't know
what to do. I'd be lost.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.995
Lost, yeah.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.749
- You look sad now. Why?
- Nothing.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.632
In all the excitement,
I hadn't thought about telling Mia.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.009
- What is wrong with me?
- Nothing is wrong with you.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.428
I feel terrible.
I should have told her before.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.014
I should have told her
the day the idea occurred to us.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.059
She deserved that.
After all she's done for me.

19:03.644 --> 19:06.146
- Hello?
- Lorelai, your daughter's being impossible.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.733
- She won't pose in an appropriate manner.
- I'm trying to, Grandma.

19:09.775 --> 19:12.277
- It's just awkward.
- Let me guess how you're posing her.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.196
She's in a silly gown, on a silly chair...

19:14.279 --> 19:16.406
with both of her hands raised
in some silly way.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.159
Just the one hand is raised,
and none of it's silly.

19:19.368 --> 19:20.619
Pick a simpler pose.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.121
This is the simplest,
and it wasn't my choice.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.623
And your choice is?

19:24.706 --> 19:27.709
I wanted the swan to sit regally
aside Rory's throne.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.419
Swan? Throne?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.630
Now you have a problem
with swans and thrones.

19:31.713 --> 19:35.467
Because swans and thrones scream
one thing, Mom: Siegfried and Roy.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.885
- Who?
- Make a change, Mom.

19:36.969 --> 19:39.471
I suppose you'd have her in the chair,
reading a book.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.390
Now, that sounds great.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.517
- Be serious.
- I am!

19:43.600 --> 19:45.769
That's a completely natural pose for Rory.

19:45.811 --> 19:49.147
And a painting of her reading
that's gonna be hung in Dad's study...

19:49.231 --> 19:50.899
seems just crazy enough to work.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.111
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.446
Give it a try, and let her lower her arm.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.907
- Rory, you can lower your arm.
- Thanks.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.704
I think he's just hungry.
We're going to lose the swan!

20:03.829 --> 20:05.831
Good going, Mom. Bye.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.710
So, how do I do this?

20:09.793 --> 20:13.630
- How do I tell Mia that I'm leaving?
- Get her drunk first?

20:13.922 --> 20:17.634
I can't believe it. I'm gonna let down
the one person in my life...

20:17.676 --> 20:20.012
who was there for me
when I needed it the most.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.599
I wanted to put it on the front desk,
but I think it might be a tad short.

20:23.682 --> 20:27.144
We could get a carpenter to build up
a base and raise it up two inches...

20:27.186 --> 20:30.022
- and then it would be perfect.
- Great idea.

20:31.023 --> 20:33.275
- I got that, every word!
- Yes!

20:33.942 --> 20:35.402
I'm so proud.

20:36.862 --> 20:39.364
So, you gonna tell her now or later?

20:39.865 --> 20:43.577
Later, because she's so happy
that she can finally understand Michel...

20:43.660 --> 20:47.122
and that the lamp is fixed and...
And that, too.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.500
- We're late.
- We're not late.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.002
Last time, Taylor said
there would be consequences.

20:52.044 --> 20:54.546
No, he said there would be
severe consequences.

20:54.588 --> 20:55.797
What time is it? Are we late?

20:55.881 --> 20:57.216
- I hope so.
- Mia?

20:57.299 --> 21:00.636
I'm sorry, but it's been two years
since I've been to a town meeting...

21:00.719 --> 21:02.638
and I want some controversy.

21:02.721 --> 21:05.224
Jeez! Don't sneak up on me like that.

21:05.307 --> 21:08.602
Yeah, boy, I was lucky
you had your phasers on stun.

21:09.061 --> 21:11.021
At least we're not late. Luke's never late.

21:11.063 --> 21:14.733
- Actually, we're two minutes early.
- We should get a prize for being on time.

21:14.816 --> 21:18.195
Luke, let's go back to the diner
and get some pie as our reward.

21:18.237 --> 21:20.864
- Then you'd be late.
- A funny conundrum, but I want pie.

21:20.906 --> 21:23.242
- You're harassing me now.
- I'm not harassing you.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.535
We're your groupies.

21:24.576 --> 21:28.038
- 'Luke, you're so dreamy. Be my guy. '
- 'No, be my guy. '

21:28.121 --> 21:30.666
I'm bringing up the need
for more police protection.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.128
I think we're late.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.047
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

21:37.089 --> 21:40.467
Meeting was supposed to start at 8:00.
It's a minute to 8:00.

21:40.551 --> 21:43.762
- You might as well be honest with him.
- Honest about what?

21:43.804 --> 21:46.265
If you must know,
there was a special issue...

21:46.306 --> 21:48.433
the business community
had to deal with first...

21:48.517 --> 21:49.977
so we decided to start early.

21:50.060 --> 21:53.689
I'm in the business community,
and I wasn't told about it.

21:54.273 --> 21:57.651
- Taylor?
- All right, fine! You weren't invited, Luke.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.362
- And why is that?
- Controversy.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.699
You weren't invited because
we are dealing with the Jess situation.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.117
The Jess situation?

22:05.200 --> 22:08.871
If this was the Wild West, we'd be diving
into the water trough about now.

22:08.954 --> 22:09.955
Damn it, Taylor!

22:10.038 --> 22:13.500
- Luke, honey, calm down.
- After all, this is all your doing.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.878
If you hadn't so cavalierly dismissed
the issue...

22:15.961 --> 22:17.296
we wouldn't have had to do this.

22:17.379 --> 22:20.299
I lost business because of
what your hooligan nephew did.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.800
How was business lost, Taylor?

22:21.884 --> 22:25.053
If you opened late that day,
your customers just came back later.

22:25.137 --> 22:29.308
Not so. When Mrs. Lanahan couldn't buy
her head of lettuce for her lunch...

22:29.349 --> 22:33.145
she drove straight to Woodbury
to buy lettuce from a competing market.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.272
Isn't that right, Mrs. Lanahan?

22:39.067 --> 22:40.986
You really shouldn't be driving anymore.

22:41.028 --> 22:44.239
Word has it that she was telling
other Doose's Market shoppers...

22:44.323 --> 22:47.951
that Woodbury lettuce is crisper.
That's business flying out the door.

22:48.035 --> 22:50.287
Fine. How much is a head of lettuce? $1?

22:50.329 --> 22:51.955
Let's go crazy. Give me five heads.

22:52.039 --> 22:55.000
This goes well beyond a head of lettuce,
young man.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.002
The charges against your nephew
are numerous.

22:57.085 --> 22:59.421
- He stole 'Save the Bridge' money.
- He gave it back.

22:59.505 --> 23:02.257
- Stole a gnome from Babette's garden.
- Pierpont was returned.

23:02.341 --> 23:06.553
- He hooted at one of my dance classes.
- He took a garden hose from my yard.

23:06.637 --> 23:09.348
My son said he set off the fire alarms
at school last week.

23:09.389 --> 23:12.684
I heard he controls the weather
and wrote the screenplay to Glitter!

23:12.768 --> 23:15.604
- I think it's time for me to pipe in.
- Yeah, that'll be good.

23:15.687 --> 23:18.524
I have every right, Luke.
I'm a local entrepreneur.

23:18.607 --> 23:22.027
You took over your father's newsstand.
Doesn't make you an entrepreneur.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.029
You took over
your old man's hardware store.

23:24.071 --> 23:27.533
- And turned it into a diner.
- Big whoop! Who can't fry an egg?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.117
Let's keep things moving here, boys.

23:29.201 --> 23:31.995
I never liked the look of that kid
from the second I saw him.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.081
- Unbelievable!
- Excuse me, I've got the floor.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.792
- You don't have the floor.
- I'm standing, aren't I?

23:36.875 --> 23:39.211
I was standing first,
which means I have the floor...

23:39.294 --> 23:41.672
- and I'm not giving it to you.
- What is with you two?

23:41.713 --> 23:44.049
This goes way beyond
the Jess matter, Taylor.

23:44.091 --> 23:47.344
Luke's been on me since first grade,
when he wrongfully accused me...

23:47.386 --> 23:50.222
of sabotaging a clay imprint
that he made of his hand.

23:50.264 --> 23:52.391
Think hard. Was he dressed like Sulu?

23:52.474 --> 23:54.893
No one cares about
the stupid clay hand, Bootsy!

23:54.935 --> 23:57.312
And you stomped on it,
and three kids saw you!

23:57.396 --> 23:58.522
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

23:58.605 --> 24:00.691
- No, I didn't.
- Boys, please!

24:00.732 --> 24:04.319
The bottom line here is that there is
a consensus among townspeople...

24:04.403 --> 24:08.240
who are in agreement that Stars Hollow
was a better place before Jess got here.

24:08.282 --> 24:11.368
This half of the room gets the tar,
the other gets the feathers?

24:11.410 --> 24:14.246
There hasn't been any talk
of tar and feathers, although...

24:14.288 --> 24:16.665
Look, I've lived in this town
my entire life...

24:16.748 --> 24:18.375
longer than most everybody here.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.419
Beg to differ.
I'm five weeks older than you.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.045
That means I've been here longer.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.339
I've never bothered anyone,
I've kept to myself...

24:24.423 --> 24:25.841
and I've done the best I could.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.510
I pay my taxes,
and I help people when I can.

24:28.594 --> 24:31.638
I haven't pitched in on the decorative,
pageantry town stuff...

24:31.722 --> 24:35.434
because it all seems insane to me,
but I don't get in the way of that, either!

24:35.517 --> 24:37.436
- What's your point, Luke?
- His point is...

24:37.519 --> 24:39.188
- Do you mind?
- Be my guest.

24:39.271 --> 24:42.441
- If there's a problem...
- And I'm not saying there's a problem.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.110
Right. But if there is,
give him time to deal with it...

24:45.194 --> 24:47.029
before you storm his diner.

24:47.112 --> 24:51.116
Right, what I'm dealing with, being
a problem that I don't necessarily agree...

24:51.200 --> 24:52.784
that I even have!

24:52.868 --> 24:55.078
- Right.
- I didn't get that last part.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.331
Lay off him,
because what you're all doing stinks.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.917
I'm done here. I'm done with all of you.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.587
I was gonna stay open later in case anyone
wanted to eat after the meeting.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.047
Forget that.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.301
His turkey burgers are very dry.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.096
Well, I must say, that was quite exciting.

25:13.138 --> 25:16.308
A little disturbing.
I think the whole town needs a field trip.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.310
- You think Luke's okay?
- I think he will be.

25:18.393 --> 25:19.895
Just needs to cool off a little.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.313
I'm gonna go check on Dean.

25:21.355 --> 25:24.066
He's been scraping the outline
off the cement for two days.

25:24.149 --> 25:26.527
Good idea.
There's nothing like your face on his...

25:26.610 --> 25:28.487
to make the cleaning process go faster.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.948
- She's all yours, Mia.
- I'll take her.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.282
Bye, hon.

25:32.866 --> 25:35.661
I am just having the most wonderful time.

25:35.994 --> 25:40.624
And I am so proud of you and Rory.
You both have just come so far.

25:40.791 --> 25:42.292
Yeah, we have.

25:44.837 --> 25:48.674
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Of course. What is it, honey?

25:49.842 --> 25:53.095
It's really hard, and I should have
brought it up ages ago...

25:53.178 --> 25:55.764
but Sookie and I
are thinking of making a change.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.099
A change?

25:57.432 --> 25:59.768
We're going to open our own inn.

26:00.644 --> 26:04.439
We've talked about it for a long time,
and it seems like the time is right.

26:04.523 --> 26:07.901
I love the Independence Inn,
and Sookie loves it, too.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.362
- And we both love you so much.
- I know.

26:10.445 --> 26:13.490
But it just feels like something
we need to do.

26:14.658 --> 26:16.660
- You hate me.
- No, I don't.

26:16.702 --> 26:19.288
I'm letting you down.
I'm walking out. Being ungrateful.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.831
Lorelai, stop.

26:20.914 --> 26:24.376
Do you think I was naive enough to think
that you'd work for me forever?

26:24.418 --> 26:27.713
You and Sookie have more talent
for this business than I do...

26:27.796 --> 26:29.464
and I'm very good.

26:29.715 --> 26:32.259
You're going to open an incredible place.

26:32.342 --> 26:36.847
And if you don't let me help you
in any way I can, then I'll be very mad.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.892
Of course we need your help.
We'd be lost without your help.

26:39.933 --> 26:44.271
Good. I was just wondering,
what's the time frame for this big move?

26:44.354 --> 26:46.899
We're waiting
for this perfect location to free up.

26:46.982 --> 26:49.359
But you'll have plenty of notice...

26:49.401 --> 26:51.862
and I'll be there to find replacements
and train them.

26:51.904 --> 26:54.031
That's very sweet of you,
but I'm wondering...

26:54.072 --> 26:56.283
if you could make it sooner
rather than later.

26:56.366 --> 26:57.367
What?

26:57.409 --> 27:01.455
Your leaving gives me the perfect excuse
to finally sell the place.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.581
Sell the place?

27:02.664 --> 27:07.377
I get offers all the time, lucrative ones,
but I never even considered it because...

27:07.419 --> 27:10.964
Of course I love the inn,
but I couldn't do that to you.

27:11.715 --> 27:14.927
And now that you have this big change
coming up in your life...

27:14.968 --> 27:17.387
it might be time for one in mine.

27:19.181 --> 27:20.933
Good.

27:21.016 --> 27:25.562
- Then it all works out good.
- Actually, it's very good.

27:26.146 --> 27:29.942
Okay. Well, good.

27:51.922 --> 27:55.133
So, I'm working on the menu
for the Duncan wedding.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.261
- I can't read that.
- I know.

27:57.302 --> 28:00.556
I had it all typed up neat to begin with,
but on the drive to work...

28:00.639 --> 28:03.267
I got an inspiration.
I started writing in the new stuff.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.644
And it ain't easy writing and driving.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.856
- I can't read that. What is that?
- I can't read that, either.

28:08.939 --> 28:12.442
I'll just get you a new one.
How did your talk with Mia go?

28:12.484 --> 28:15.112
Fine. Good. She took it
like you said she would: Classy.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.739
She is classy. Good. That's a relief.

28:17.823 --> 28:20.242
It's a relief, right?
You said she took it good?

28:20.325 --> 28:22.286
- Yes, she did.
- But you look upset.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.164
- She's gonna sell the inn.
- You're kidding.

28:25.247 --> 28:29.376
She says gets offers, and
this might be fortuitous timing for her.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.587
Well, great. Everybody wins.

28:31.670 --> 28:35.299
That's good. Look happy.
Okay, this does not look happy.

28:35.382 --> 28:37.092
I don't understand how she can do this.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.844
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal is...

28:38.927 --> 28:40.637
she's not gonna sell it to another Mia.

28:40.679 --> 28:43.390
It's gonna be a big chain,
they'll come marching in...

28:43.473 --> 28:46.476
with their business models,
and their architects and designers...

28:46.560 --> 28:50.230
change everything, the place will lose
all its personality and charm.

28:50.314 --> 28:53.650
I hope they don't,
but our place is gonna be full of charm.

28:53.692 --> 28:55.110
You don't care what happens here?

28:55.194 --> 28:58.822
Of course I do. But it's not up to me.
I can't control that.

28:58.906 --> 29:01.909
The only thing we can control
is what our inn's gonna be like.

29:01.992 --> 29:03.577
- I guess.
- You guess what?

29:03.660 --> 29:05.078
- We'll see.
- We'll see what?

29:05.162 --> 29:09.041
It's shortsighted to write off this place
when we haven't even bought Fran's yet.

29:09.124 --> 29:12.669
- And we don't know if we will.
- We don't? Why wouldn't we?

29:14.004 --> 29:15.881
Is this about Fran's life expectancy...

29:15.964 --> 29:19.593
No, Sookie, it's about the fact
that we haven't looked at other places.

29:19.676 --> 29:23.847
And we don't know if that's the right one.
We have to be very practical about this.

29:23.889 --> 29:26.183
But it's the perfect location.
We all said so.

29:26.225 --> 29:29.353
You can't get emotionally attached
to our decisions about the inn.

29:29.436 --> 29:31.563
This is business.
You've got to stay detached.

29:31.647 --> 29:33.982
But we're all so not detached.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.985
- Do you have another location in mind?
- Not really.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.862
Wanna look for a new location?

29:38.904 --> 29:42.157
Yeah, like I have all this time
to go looking for other locations.

29:42.241 --> 29:44.368
I don't know.
Should we try to buy this place?

29:44.409 --> 29:46.578
This place is five times
what we can afford.

29:46.662 --> 29:49.665
- So what do we do?
- I don't know. It's on hold, I guess.

29:49.748 --> 29:52.417
It's been on hold for years.
We were moving forward.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.962
I'm looking at the economy right now...

29:55.045 --> 29:57.256
and I don't know if the timing's good.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.300
That's not fair because I don't know
anything about the economy.

30:00.384 --> 30:03.220
Good you hooked up with me,
because it's not looking good.

30:03.262 --> 30:05.264
- Okay, what happened?
- What do you mean?

30:05.305 --> 30:07.307
We had a vision, we had a plan.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.601
You're the one
that got this ball rolling again...

30:09.685 --> 30:12.938
and then I jump on the ball,
we're rolling on the ball together...

30:12.980 --> 30:15.691
then you hopped off the ball,
and I'm still on the ball!

30:15.774 --> 30:20.279
I'm confused, because I see our vision.
And you saw it, too, up until today.

30:20.362 --> 30:23.115
Well, I know you would like things
to be simple...

30:23.198 --> 30:25.701
but unfortunately,
things are more complicated.

30:25.784 --> 30:28.245
That's why we'd be partners.
If something gets heavy...

30:28.287 --> 30:30.372
the other one's there to pick up the slack.

30:30.455 --> 30:33.292
Yes, well, that's great in theory,
but I've got to tell you...

30:33.375 --> 30:36.295
my back is aching
from all the slack I'm taking up.

30:36.336 --> 30:39.590
- What did I do that's so wrong?
- Let's not get into this stuff!

30:39.631 --> 30:41.258
No, get into it!

30:41.925 --> 30:44.219
You're not the most reliable person
in the world.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.638
- Or the most punctual.
- You've always known that.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.391
But getting into business, it's not so cute.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.935
It could hurt us.
You were late for the Fran meeting.

30:52.019 --> 30:55.314
You're constantly changing menus,
even after you've started making it.

30:55.355 --> 30:58.775
I don't believe this. Before, it was kudos
for attention to detail.

30:58.817 --> 31:01.945
- I was 'the maestro. '
- That's fine for an established place...

31:02.029 --> 31:04.406
but you do that at our place,
it could wipe us out.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.992
Profit margins in a new business are slim.

31:07.075 --> 31:11.330
- Stop! Now you're talking down to me.
- I'm trying to explain.

31:11.371 --> 31:15.000
Yes, and I don't know why you are,
but I don't want to start crying...

31:15.083 --> 31:17.628
because it'll give you
one more thing to point at...

31:17.669 --> 31:21.006
to say, 'She's too emotional and weak
to go into business with. '

31:21.089 --> 31:22.174
So I'm leaving.

31:22.257 --> 31:25.719
And I'll see you tomorrow,
if I can remember to show up.

31:29.973 --> 31:32.476
- I've got to drop by the market.
- But it's your day off.

31:32.559 --> 31:33.977
It's to get my paycheck.

31:34.019 --> 31:36.563
If I don't get it by 4:00,
Taylor locks it in a safe.

31:36.647 --> 31:37.814
It's on some kind of timer.

31:37.856 --> 31:41.318
When I complain, he lectures me
on promptly putting checks in the bank...

31:41.401 --> 31:45.197
and my head hurts from all the
nodding I do, even though I don't listen...

31:45.239 --> 31:48.408
- Go.
- I'll just be a minute.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.499
Should you be standing here all alone?

31:55.582 --> 31:58.377
- I hear this is a dangerous corner.
- I'm fine.

31:58.418 --> 32:01.004
- Feeling succinct today?
- Pretty much.

32:01.547 --> 32:03.966
- Did I do something to offend?
- Me? No.

32:04.258 --> 32:06.844
- Ask that same question to Luke.
- Meaning?

32:06.927 --> 32:09.888
- You've got this whole town down on him.
- How did I do that?

32:09.930 --> 32:11.348
You know how.

32:11.390 --> 32:13.725
I'm familiar with the blue-book laws
in this town...

32:13.767 --> 32:15.727
you could be talking about a lot of things.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.855
Dropping a gum wrapper,
strolling arm in arm...

32:17.938 --> 32:20.941
with a member of the opposite sex
on a Sunday.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.194
What about it?

32:24.278 --> 32:26.280
You did it.
The whole town knows you did it.

32:26.363 --> 32:29.908
- They had a meeting about it.
- You actually went to that?

32:30.033 --> 32:32.661
Those things are so To Kill a Mockingbird.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.496
Yes, I went, and Luke went.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.665
When he got there,
they ganged up on him.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.876
- They all want you gone.
- Bummer.

32:38.959 --> 32:43.463
And he's defending you and paying Taylor
back for his lettuce losses.

32:43.547 --> 32:46.800
- His what?
- Now Luke's a pariah, all because of you.

32:48.177 --> 32:50.345
What a shock.
You don't care about any of this.

32:50.429 --> 32:52.014
I didn't say that.

32:52.097 --> 32:55.225
- Go. I'm tired of talking to you.
- Fine.

32:57.561 --> 33:00.439
You care nothing
about Luke and his feelings!

33:00.480 --> 33:01.732
You got a second wind?

33:01.773 --> 33:05.235
All he does is stick up for you,
and all you do is make his life harder!

33:05.319 --> 33:09.031
You have to when you're trying
to be Holden Caulfield, but I think it stinks.

33:09.114 --> 33:13.535
Luke has done a lot for my mom and me,
and I don't like to see him attacked.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.537
Okay, second wind over.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.874
Didn't know they were hard on him.

33:18.957 --> 33:21.251
I never pegged you as clueless.
My mistake.

33:21.293 --> 33:23.587
Okay, I get it.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.756
I do, I get it.

33:28.467 --> 33:30.969
Don't you at least think it was funny?

33:32.638 --> 33:36.308
- That is so not the point.
- Yeah, you thought it was funny.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.851
I got it.

33:39.937 --> 33:41.897
Dean, I don't think you two have met.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.566
- This is Jess. This is Dean.
- Boyfriend?

33:44.650 --> 33:47.069
- Of course.
- Sorry. You didn't say.

33:47.152 --> 33:48.946
- How you doing?
- Good.

33:50.322 --> 33:54.243
- Okay, see you around.
- Seems to turn out that way, doesn't it?

34:01.708 --> 34:03.126
Is Grandpa still in Akron?

34:03.168 --> 34:06.296
For Akron's sake,
I hope he's moved on to Boise.

34:09.091 --> 34:12.010
Hi, we're the daughter
and the granddaughter.

34:12.386 --> 34:14.596
- You are majorly crabby.
- I just have a headache.

34:14.679 --> 34:18.725
Good! Come. It's all done, and it's great.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.984
- What do you think?
- It's freaky.

34:27.025 --> 34:30.237
- Freaky?
- Just seeing me up on the wall like that.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.822
I like it, though. It's good, I guess.

34:32.864 --> 34:35.534
I should take myself out
of the judging process.

34:35.617 --> 34:38.954
I think Richard's gonna love it.
It's perfect. Don't you think?

34:39.036 --> 34:41.956
- It turned out better than you thought.
- Yeah.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.835
Come on. Say a little more than that.

34:44.918 --> 34:48.213
It's great, Mom.
It's just a notch below Rembrandt.

34:48.505 --> 34:50.674
You don't have to take that attitude.

34:50.716 --> 34:54.344
I'd light some sparklers
and jump up and down, yelling 'yay'...

34:54.386 --> 34:57.264
but I'm out of sparklers,
and my feet hurt too much to jump.

34:57.347 --> 35:02.269
But next week, when I have more energy,
I'll write a love song for the chandelier!

35:03.061 --> 35:04.104
Mom.

35:08.859 --> 35:13.238
How dare you walk away from me
when I'm being a world-class jerk to you?

35:14.114 --> 35:17.242
- The painting's great, Mom, really.
- Thank you.

35:17.326 --> 35:18.869
I really like it.

35:18.911 --> 35:21.872
It's so natural that she's reading,
which is great.

35:21.914 --> 35:26.210
She's not sitting next to a goose,
which is good, and Dad is gonna love it.

35:26.293 --> 35:28.128
It's a good thing you did here.

35:28.212 --> 35:32.591
You can be so harsh, and I don't know
where it comes from, or what I've done.

35:32.633 --> 35:35.344
- You did nothing.
- I must have done something.

35:35.427 --> 35:37.721
It's just been a bad week.

35:38.055 --> 35:41.934
Sookie and I were moving forward
with plans to open our inn...

35:42.100 --> 35:43.477
and we had a huge fight.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.146
We've never had a huge fight,
let alone a fight.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.650
Awful things were said. It started
when Mia showed up for a visit...

35:49.733 --> 35:51.777
and I told her about our plans.

35:51.860 --> 35:56.198
She's talking about selling the
Independence Inn, and it wigged me out.

35:56.281 --> 35:58.283
It's stupid. I don't know.

35:58.742 --> 36:01.912
But it was our home for so long,
mine and Rory's.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.957
It's just weird to think
that it wouldn't be there...

36:04.998 --> 36:08.210
and Mia wouldn't be there,
and I wouldn't be there.

36:08.627 --> 36:12.548
And I just got very upset.
Anyway, I'm rambling.

36:14.132 --> 36:16.301
The painting is really great.

36:18.595 --> 36:20.681
Will you accept my apology?

36:21.515 --> 36:24.434
Yes, I will. I've had bad days, too.

36:25.561 --> 36:28.272
- Thank you.
- We should get back to Rory.

36:32.484 --> 36:35.612
- Okay, I'm pretty much done.
- Thanks for doing this.

36:35.696 --> 36:38.490
I didn't want the rain
to destroy your beautiful chuppah...

36:38.574 --> 36:42.161
I looked in the yellow pages, and
didn't see a chuppah waterproofer listing.

36:42.244 --> 36:44.538
How about
chuppah-goat-figure repairman?

36:44.621 --> 36:45.914
- Gilbert.
- What?

36:45.998 --> 36:48.625
We named the goat Gilbert.
He's headless. Can you fix him?

36:48.709 --> 36:51.378
- Yeah, I got some glue here. I can fix him.
- Good.

36:51.461 --> 36:52.880
I'll make some tea.

36:52.963 --> 36:55.841
So, Sookie stopped at the diner
this morning.

36:55.966 --> 36:59.136
I asked her
how your plans were going at the new inn.

36:59.178 --> 37:02.431
She awkwardly changed the subject
to women's basketball.

37:02.514 --> 37:04.766
She's never shown much interest
in sports before.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.059
What's going on with that?

37:06.143 --> 37:08.937
Women's basketball
is getting super popular.

37:09.021 --> 37:12.316
That's good, I think.
The tall girls need an outlet.

37:12.399 --> 37:14.985
We had a fight. A big, humongous fight.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.738
- She's never gonna speak to me again.
- What happened?

37:17.821 --> 37:21.658
I just flat-out panicked about the enormity
of what we were getting into...

37:21.700 --> 37:25.329
and it clobbered me,
and I clobbered Sookie. I'm such a jerk.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.915
- If I cry, will it freak you out?
- Totally.

37:27.998 --> 37:29.917
- If I whimper?
- How about you suck it up?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.711
- I'll try.
- You're as ready as you've ever been.

37:34.296 --> 37:37.132
Luke, do not underestimate
the total lack of confidence...

37:37.216 --> 37:38.383
I have in my abilities.

37:38.467 --> 37:41.303
You're the most confident person I know,
obnoxiously so.

37:41.386 --> 37:43.180
- Thank you.
- I mean in a good way.

37:43.222 --> 37:47.351
- You're good at what you do.
- I'm good at doing what I have to do.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.269
When I had to get a job, I got it.

37:49.353 --> 37:51.480
When I had to find a house, I got it.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.815
When I had to get Rory into Chilton,
I did it.

37:53.899 --> 37:55.984
But I don't have to leave
the Independence Inn.

37:56.068 --> 37:58.028
I don't have to go into business for myself.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.863
I don't have to walk out on that limb...

37:59.905 --> 38:03.116
- and risk everything I've worked for.
- Don't do it.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.327
- What?
- Just stay where you are.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.579
What is this, reverse psychology?

38:07.663 --> 38:10.249
No, just stay at the inn.
You're happy there.

38:10.332 --> 38:13.001
- So you think I can't hack it?
- Of course you can hack it.

38:13.085 --> 38:17.756
- Great, lip service. That's what I need.
- If I start to cry, will that freak you out?

38:17.840 --> 38:20.551
I couldn't stay where I am if I wanted.

38:20.634 --> 38:22.636
Mia is selling the inn...

38:23.095 --> 38:25.931
and that hit me hard, too,
maybe harder than the other thing.

38:26.014 --> 38:27.558
I'm gonna be without a home.

38:27.599 --> 38:29.351
What do you mean? This is your home.

38:29.434 --> 38:33.272
No, I mean a home-home,
a memory home.

38:34.231 --> 38:36.859
The inn is where Rory took her first step.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.944
It's where I took my first step.

38:39.027 --> 38:41.697
It's more of a home to me
than my parents' house ever was.

38:41.780 --> 38:45.159
You're scared, like everybody else
when they're taking on something big.

38:45.242 --> 38:47.536
What does everybody do
to get through this feeling?

38:47.619 --> 38:52.249
They run in the back, throw up, pass out,
then smack their head on the floor.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.376
I did that on the morning
I opened the diner.

38:54.459 --> 38:56.712
There is no button to push
to get you through this.

38:56.795 --> 39:00.757
You've just got to jump in and be scared
and stick with it until it gets fun.

39:01.341 --> 39:04.344
- How long till the diner got fun?
- About a year.

39:04.428 --> 39:07.139
- And there's no button? Can I pull a lever?
- No.

39:07.222 --> 39:08.390
- Turn a knob?
- No.

39:08.473 --> 39:10.684
- You just jump?
- You just jump.

39:11.643 --> 39:14.104
- I want to do it.
- You should do it.

39:14.688 --> 39:15.898
Check it out.

39:15.981 --> 39:18.734
- Gilbert, you're not worse for the wear.
- I'll reattach him.

39:18.817 --> 39:20.319
How did this happen, anyway?

39:20.402 --> 39:22.529
Something must've smacked into it
with a hedger.

39:22.613 --> 39:26.492
Well, now no one will ever know.
Women's basketball is in season.

39:26.533 --> 39:28.494
You might want to run
that news past Sookie.

39:28.577 --> 39:30.496
Maybe you can go to a game
or something.

39:30.537 --> 39:33.707
Yeah, or something. Thanks.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.340
Hi.

39:44.092 --> 39:47.137
Meatloaf, mashed potatoes,
stuffing: Comfort food?

39:47.179 --> 39:49.181
It would be good
with the weather changing.

39:49.223 --> 39:51.850
If you don't think it's right,
I can make something else.

39:51.934 --> 39:56.480
Although I'm on-schedule and on-budget,
so a change would throw things off.

39:56.522 --> 39:58.857
No, everything looks great.

40:01.276 --> 40:03.028
- Sookie.
- Yeah?

40:03.570 --> 40:05.823
I'm sorry about what happened.

40:05.989 --> 40:08.534
I said stupid things,
and I said them for reasons...

40:08.617 --> 40:11.537
that have nothing to do with you,
I hate myself for doing it...

40:11.620 --> 40:13.413
and I know you do, too, and I am sorry.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.374
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

40:15.457 --> 40:18.252
You are a brilliant chef
and to do things differently...

40:18.335 --> 40:20.379
from how you do them now is ridiculous.

40:20.462 --> 40:23.507
You don't tell a great violinist
to hold his bow differently.

40:23.590 --> 40:27.469
You don't tell a great cymbal player
to crash his cymbals differently.

40:27.553 --> 40:30.514
- There are great cymbal players?
- Theoretically.

40:30.597 --> 40:34.268
- Okay, well, it's okay.
- I want to go ahead with our plans.

40:34.351 --> 40:36.854
Forget my freakout.
Pretend it didn't happen.

40:36.937 --> 40:38.689
Let's move forward.

40:39.815 --> 40:42.901
- You don't want to move forward?
- I do, but I need your promise...

40:42.985 --> 40:45.445
- you're not gonna lose it on me again.
- I promise.

40:45.529 --> 40:48.031
'Cause I couldn't take
losing a business partner...

40:48.073 --> 40:51.160
and my best friend in one fell swoop.
It'd be too much.

40:51.785 --> 40:54.538
I will place my hand
on whatever you want and swear...

40:54.580 --> 40:57.708
that you can trust that
I will not lose confidence in our dream.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.794
That's enough. I know you don't like
to put your hand on things.

41:00.878 --> 41:02.629
We're gonna give it our best shot.

41:02.713 --> 41:04.339
And if we go down after two years...

41:04.423 --> 41:07.551
It'll be the most exciting
two years of our lives.

41:07.593 --> 41:08.927
How about antiques?

41:08.969 --> 41:11.221
Absolutely. It's the best place for antiques.

41:11.263 --> 41:13.599
Michel will have a map for you
if you need it.

41:13.682 --> 41:15.017
Thank you.

41:15.517 --> 41:17.853
- Hello. Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I just...

41:17.936 --> 41:18.979
Yes?

41:20.189 --> 41:22.983
I just wanted to meet the woman
who helped raise my daughter.

41:23.066 --> 41:25.652
- Emily.
- Yes, I'm Emily Gilmore.

41:25.736 --> 41:28.614
I've wanted to meet you, too,
for a very long time.

41:28.697 --> 41:30.908
- That's nice.
- Would you like to sit down?

41:30.949 --> 41:34.328
- Have lunch with me, won't you?
- No, thank you.

41:35.162 --> 41:37.956
You have a lovely place here.
It's a beautiful hotel.

41:37.998 --> 41:42.252
- Not a home, but still a beautiful hotel.
- Sometimes home is where your hat is.

41:42.294 --> 41:45.297
- Or where your family is.
- Yes, that, too.

41:46.256 --> 41:47.674
You sure you don't want some tea?

41:47.758 --> 41:50.052
Tea usually makes things like this
less awkward.

41:50.135 --> 41:51.595
There's things to hold and stir.

41:51.678 --> 41:54.139
- I don't know why I came here.
- You wanted to meet me.

41:54.181 --> 41:56.099
After all these years, it makes no sense.

41:56.141 --> 41:59.102
- I expected you to come eventually.
- Did you?

41:59.311 --> 42:02.689
And what did you expect to say to me
when I did come?

42:02.814 --> 42:05.275
When Lorelai showed up
on my porch that day...

42:05.317 --> 42:08.654
with a tiny baby in her arms,
I thought to myself:

42:08.695 --> 42:10.531
'What if this were my daughter...

42:10.614 --> 42:14.076
'and she was cold and scared
and needed a place to live?

42:14.243 --> 42:16.078
'What would I want for her?'

42:16.161 --> 42:18.622
And then I thought,
'I'd want her to find somebody...

42:18.664 --> 42:22.251
'to take her in and make her safe
and help her find her way. '

42:22.334 --> 42:23.794
That's funny.

42:24.127 --> 42:27.965
I would've wanted her to find someone
who would send her home.

42:28.715 --> 42:30.175
I have to go.

42:30.342 --> 42:32.970
I'd appreciate
if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.

42:33.011 --> 42:34.263
I won't.

42:40.519 --> 42:43.355
Do you have pictures? From back then?

42:43.981 --> 42:46.358
I'll send you a boxful tomorrow.

42:48.318 --> 42:49.653
Thank you.

42:55.284 --> 42:58.120
Man, it's such a relief
to have that Sookie thing fixed.

42:58.203 --> 43:00.956
- I hate fighting with friends.
- That's what enemies are for.

43:01.039 --> 43:02.666
God knows we have our share of those.

43:02.708 --> 43:05.043
People who eat crunchy food
with their mouths open.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.587
People who dog-ear library books.

43:06.670 --> 43:09.339
- People who spit when they talk.
- You got me in the eye!

43:09.423 --> 43:11.425
- You totally did.
- You're full of it.

43:11.508 --> 43:12.634
Luke, where's my toast?

43:12.718 --> 43:16.054
It's gonna take a while.
My big toaster's broken, so I got stuck...

43:16.138 --> 43:19.433
with just this dinky one.
How did that happen?

43:19.516 --> 43:21.685
- You're gonna break that.
- It was broken before.

43:21.768 --> 43:22.769
It must've got better.

43:22.853 --> 43:24.980
Inanimate objects don't usually get better.

43:25.063 --> 43:26.899
- Did you fix this?
- Please.

43:27.399 --> 43:30.235
I have no idea what you're babbling about.
I don't fix things.

43:30.319 --> 43:32.571
- But yesterday...
- I've got school.

44:26.917 --> 44:27.918
