[instrumental music]

00:10.333 --> 00:12.750
(Delenn)
The humans have a phrase.

00:12.833 --> 00:16.833
What is past...is prologue.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.250
I am really excited
about signing on board

00:19.333 --> 00:21.208
the Icarus next week.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.292
(Anna)
John and I were supposed to
spend some time together

00:23.375 --> 00:25.375
but Dr. Chang thinks
he's found the ruins of

00:25.458 --> 00:27.458
an ancient civilization
that no one's ever even

00:27.542 --> 00:29.583
heard of before.

(Sheridan)
Anna, the Icarus.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.208
They found something,
didn't they?

00:54.292 --> 00:56.625
(Delenn)
Yes. Once awakened..

00:56.708 --> 00:59.375
...the Shadows could not
allow them to leave.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.917
Those who
would not serve..

01:02.000 --> 01:03.875
...were killed.

01:03.958 --> 01:06.292
One hundred and thirty nine
people died on board

01:06.375 --> 01:09.083
the Icarus, Mr. Morden.

01:09.167 --> 01:11.042
Including my wife.

01:13.708 --> 01:14.958
And here you sit..

01:15.042 --> 01:16.542
'...not a scratch.'

01:18.417 --> 01:20.458
(Delenn)
When Minbari become close..

01:20.542 --> 01:25.042
It is tradition that they
spend three nights together.

01:25.125 --> 01:29.500
The male sleeps
and the female watches.

01:29.583 --> 01:34.208
As you relax,
your true face is revealed.

01:38.542 --> 01:41.083
[music continues]

01:52.958 --> 01:54.542
(Anna)
'Hello.'

01:54.625 --> 01:56.500
You must be Delenn.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.542
I'm Anna Sheridan,
John's wife.

02:04.292 --> 02:07.417
(Delenn)
Minbari also have a phrase.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.333
What is past..

02:09.417 --> 02:12.375
...is also sometimes
the future.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.625
Anna?

02:27.083 --> 02:28.875
My God!

02:30.667 --> 02:32.375
What are you doing here?

02:32.458 --> 02:35.083
"What are you doing here?"

02:35.167 --> 02:38.042
After five years, that's
the best that you can do?

02:40.208 --> 02:42.833
Though under the circumstances,
I can understand.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.167
I...I should go.

02:48.542 --> 02:51.167
- I should go.
- No, Delenn, wait.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.917
It's alright, John.
Let her go.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.042
You can talk to her later.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.708
This should be a moment for us.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.917
I thought you were dead.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
You mean she didn't..

03:04.083 --> 03:06.083
She didn't tell you?

03:07.500 --> 03:10.458
[scoffs]
Well, that is interesting.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.958
Oh, John..

03:15.042 --> 03:18.833
I'm sorry that
I couldn't tell you myself.

03:18.917 --> 03:23.000
I'm sorry for leaving you
alone for so long

03:23.083 --> 03:25.333
not being able
to get word to you.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.917
But that's all behind us now.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.708
We're together again.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.500
I know what you're thinking.

03:36.583 --> 03:40.042
How can you be sure
if it's really me?

03:40.125 --> 03:42.458
For all you know,
for all she told you.

03:42.542 --> 03:46.208
thing
made up to look like me.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.167
Fine.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.292
I'll take
whatever test you want.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.833
Ask me any question,
I don't mind.

03:57.167 --> 04:00.333
I know there's a lot
that you don't know.

04:02.083 --> 04:05.125
I know there's a lot
that you don't understand.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.750
I'm here to fix that.

04:14.083 --> 04:17.500
Don't you wanna know
what it's all about?

04:18.583 --> 04:21.083
What it's really all about?

04:22.417 --> 04:23.833
I can do that.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.667
All you have to do
is come with me.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.167
Where?

04:31.250 --> 04:33.708
Where else?

04:33.792 --> 04:35.375
To Z'ha'dum.

04:35.458 --> 04:38.000
[intense music]

(Ivanova)
The Babylon Project

04:43.250 --> 04:46.417
was our last best hope
for peace.

04:50.042 --> 04:51.583
It failed.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.583
[dramatic music]

05:06.667 --> 05:08.417
But in the year
of the Shadow War

05:08.500 --> 05:10.875
it became
something greater.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.958
Our last best hope..

05:13.042 --> 05:14.708
...for victory.

05:18.792 --> 05:21.125
The year is 2260.

(G'Kar)
There they are,
commander, as promised.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.833
The ambassador from Gaim
was happy to deliver them.

06:17.917 --> 06:21.292
Each of these devices carries
terrible destructive force.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.125
In human terms, they can
deliver a thermonuclear blast

06:24.208 --> 06:26.167
of five or six hundred megatons.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.458
Will they show up
on a scanner?

06:27.542 --> 06:29.250
Only if you know
what you're looking for.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.167
Otherwise, they're
completely undetectable.

06:31.250 --> 06:34.542
So, the next time we find out
where the Shadows plan to strike

06:34.625 --> 06:36.333
We can mine the area,
and as soon as they

06:36.417 --> 06:37.625
come out of hyperspace..

06:37.708 --> 06:40.667
Then as you
so concisely say...boom.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.958
Good. Thank you
for delivering these, G'Kar.

06:44.042 --> 06:45.792
The captain will be
very happy about this.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.625
Where is Sheridan?
I thought he would be here.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.292
Well, it's a little
hard to explain.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.833
Let's just say that
something came up.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.000
- Well?
- She's human.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.042
I checked her dental
and medical records against

07:09.125 --> 07:12.083
what you gave me,
it's a 100% match

07:12.167 --> 07:14.167
right down to
her DNA sequence.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.583
Every piece of equipment
I've got says that's your wife.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.000
Anna died at Z'ha'dum.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.583
Well, she looks
pretty lively to me.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.125
I thought you'd be happy
to have her back.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.667
Oh, it's not that easy.

07:28.750 --> 07:33.000
It was years before I could
finally accept her death.

07:33.083 --> 07:37.375
I had to force myself to start
over, to create a new life.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.042
- A-and Delenn..
- Have you talked to her yet?

07:40.125 --> 07:43.000
She was in my quarters
when Anna showed up.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.292
Is-is there anything else?

07:47.375 --> 07:50.000
There's some epidermal scarring
just above the nape of her neck.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.833
Now, it may have been
caused when the Icarus

07:51.917 --> 07:53.083
was destroyed, but, uh..

07:53.167 --> 07:54.833
Anything beneath it?

07:54.917 --> 07:56.417
[sighs]
No, no, no.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.708
Now, maybe it's nothing.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.750
But, it never hurts
to run a few more tests.

07:59.833 --> 08:01.208
Alright, do so.

08:01.292 --> 08:02.708
If this is a trick,
I'm gonna take it out

08:02.792 --> 08:04.750
of somebody's hide.

08:04.833 --> 08:08.333
But if it's not
and that really is Anna..

08:11.167 --> 08:13.208
I have to know, Stephen.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.542
(John)
'Is it her?'

08:19.625 --> 08:21.833
Is it?

08:21.917 --> 08:23.417
I don't know.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.375
You don't know?

08:25.458 --> 08:27.292
You and Kosh
came to my quarters.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.167
You showed me images
from Z'ha'dum of Anna

08:30.250 --> 08:32.792
Icarus
waking up the Shadows.

08:32.875 --> 08:36.500
You gave me every reason
to believe she was dead.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.917
Now, how could you do that
when you didn't know for sure?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.667
Those who would not serve
the Shadows were killed.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.750
That we knew without question.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.292
We assumed she would not serve.

08:49.375 --> 08:50.500
Perhaps we were wrong.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.417
Anna would never work
for those things.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.333
Then I have no explanation.

08:58.667 --> 09:01.208
You have no explanation.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.542
That's it?

09:06.833 --> 09:09.625
Ah, damn it, Delenn,
I have always felt

09:09.708 --> 09:11.625
that you...you were
holding out on me

09:11.708 --> 09:13.042
on a couple of things.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.917
I figured you had
your reasons, but this?

09:17.875 --> 09:19.750
I mean, if you weren't sure

09:19.833 --> 09:22.167
if there was even a chance
of her being alive

09:22.250 --> 09:23.833
why the hell
didn't you tell me?

09:23.917 --> 09:27.042
Because you would have gone
to Z'ha'dum after her.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.042
We couldn't allow that.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.083
You and Kosh..

09:37.875 --> 09:39.917
You couldn't allow it.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.542
[sighs]

09:47.917 --> 09:50.042
I trusted you, Delenn.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.125
I cared for you.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.750
I let myself start to love you.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.417
Do you know what that means?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.458
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

10:01.208 --> 10:02.833
All along, a little part
of me was still

10:02.917 --> 10:04.917
in love with Anna
even though she was gone.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.333
I had to fight that part off.

10:07.417 --> 10:10.208
Every time I-I thought
about you, about..

10:12.333 --> 10:15.792
...about holding you,
about...building a life

10:15.875 --> 10:17.417
for the two of us.

10:18.875 --> 10:22.333
John, you must believe me.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.542
I didn't know she was alive.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.042
We assumed that she had died

10:26.125 --> 10:27.958
with the rest of
the crew of the Icarus

10:28.042 --> 10:29.833
that only Morden had survived.

10:31.292 --> 10:32.958
And had you known..

10:34.417 --> 10:36.750
...would you have told me?

10:36.833 --> 10:38.375
It would depend.

10:39.958 --> 10:42.958
It would depend on
what she had become.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.042
Z'ha'dum is the home world
of the Shadows.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.750
No one leaves there
the same as they arrived.

10:51.708 --> 10:55.375
You would have denied me
the right to make that choice?

11:01.625 --> 11:04.417
How can you say that..

11:04.500 --> 11:07.083
...and expect me
to ever trust you again?

11:11.792 --> 11:13.042
John..

11:15.625 --> 11:17.292
I do love you.

11:18.875 --> 11:22.375
If you believe
nothing else I ever say..

11:23.833 --> 11:27.708
Please...please believe that.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.250
Londo, you've been like this

11:44.333 --> 11:46.958
every since the diplomatic
pouch arrived this morning.

11:47.042 --> 11:49.667
At least you can do
is tell me what's wrong.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.958
Oh, Gods, Vir.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.833
I have been promoted.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.458
'I have been offered a position
in the royal court'

11:59.542 --> 12:01.875
'as an advisor
to Emperor Cartagia'

12:01.958 --> 12:04.542
on matters
of planetary security.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.000
A very important position.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.458
This is great news.
Why would you be upset?

12:09.542 --> 12:13.167
Because it should have
come to me 20 years ago

12:13.250 --> 12:16.250
when I could
have appreciated it.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.542
Because it wasn't given to me
because I earned it.

12:19.625 --> 12:22.167
They are, I think, afraid of me.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.667
Through our friend Mr. Morden

12:23.750 --> 12:27.833
I have gained influence,
money and power.

12:27.917 --> 12:30.750
And they think I will
move against Cartagia.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.583
Then why would they reward you?

12:32.667 --> 12:34.750
It's not a reward, it's a leash.

12:34.833 --> 12:39.333
I will have to divide my time
between here and the homeworld.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.375
They are reeling me in.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.458
They will watch me
very carefully.

12:43.542 --> 12:47.208
And if I do
anything suspicious..

12:47.292 --> 12:48.875
...they will find me
in the morning

12:48.958 --> 12:52.083
with my throat slit ear to ear.

- Keep the change.
- No charge, Ambassador.

13:01.792 --> 13:05.000
- And who are you, hm?
- A friend.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.042
I was sent by our
mutual associates.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.792
I have a message.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.750
You must leave
the station at once.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.750
And why must I leave?

13:14.833 --> 13:17.542
I am very comfortable
where I am.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.792
I have told you all I can.

13:19.875 --> 13:24.000
If you won't go,
I can't be responsible.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.458
But if you value your life..

13:26.542 --> 13:29.542
...you will leave...quickly.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.250

13:36.333 --> 13:37.958
Very likely.

13:38.042 --> 13:40.833
I do not think I like
the sound of this, Vir.

No, I do not like
the sound of this at all.

examined in such detail before.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.333
Well, except by you,
of course.

At least his report confirms
that I am who I say I am.

all these years?

Mm-hm.

why come back now?

14:55.250 --> 14:57.458
I can't tell you that, not here.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.042
You have to come with me.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.583
I can guarantee your safety.
They're eager to meet you.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.625
Mm. And if I don't go?

15:04.708 --> 15:06.167
Then I'll go back without you.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.125
And you'll never know the truth.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.083
No threats?

15:12.167 --> 15:15.667
John, they aren't
what you think they are.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.625
No, no threats, no ultimatums.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.250
Just an invitation to come
and hear

15:20.333 --> 15:22.625
their side
of the story, nothing more.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.875
Why would you go back there?

15:26.958 --> 15:28.875
'Cause it's my home now.

15:28.958 --> 15:30.250
I'm doing important work.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.542
You'll understand
when we get there.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.000
No...I'm not going anywhere

15:34.083 --> 15:35.833
until I get some answers.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.000
I wanna know what happened to
you and the crew of the Icarus

15:38.083 --> 15:39.417
when you landed on Z'ha'dum.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
- John, I--
- That's my condition.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.292
Just tell me that much.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.333
And you'll go
with me to Z'ha'dum?

15:53.083 --> 15:54.333
I'll go.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.458
(Anna)
'Interplanetary expeditions
said that one of their probes'

15:59.542 --> 16:01.792
out on the rim...had found

16:01.875 --> 16:04.667
the ruins of an ancient
civilization.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.333
Dr. Chang was putting together
a follow-up expedition

16:07.417 --> 16:09.708
and he wanted me on his team.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.500
It was the find of a lifetime.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.792
What he didn't tell me
or most of the crew..

16:16.875 --> 16:20.375
...was where he really
got the information.

16:20.458 --> 16:23.542
A few years earlier
IPX had found an alien ship

16:23.625 --> 16:26.292
buried beneath
the surface of Mars.

16:26.375 --> 16:29.708
It was unlike anything
they'd ever seen before.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.875
As soon as it was
exposed to daylight..

16:31.958 --> 16:35.833
...an automatic beacon on board
sent out a coded message.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.625
Well, they knew whoever
the ship belonged to

16:37.708 --> 16:39.500
would be coming in fast
to pick it up

16:39.583 --> 16:41.750
so they moved quickly.

16:41.833 --> 16:45.917
They analyzed the ship, took
pieces of it for study later

16:46.000 --> 16:49.208
and planted
a homing device inside.

16:49.292 --> 16:51.750
Three days later,
another ship turned up

16:51.833 --> 16:54.208
'and finished digging it
out of the ground.'

16:54.292 --> 16:55.667
When it left

16:55.750 --> 16:57.625
IPX was able to track it
through hyperspace

16:57.708 --> 17:00.083
to a world out on the rim.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.083
Z'ha'dum.

17:02.167 --> 17:04.250
We didn't have a name
for it at the time.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.625
And Chang was under
strict orders from Earthforce

17:06.708 --> 17:10.333
new technologies division
to keep this top secret.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.750
As soon as we landed,
we picked up an energy source.

17:17.833 --> 17:20.167
We were told
to check it out.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.083
And that's where
we found them.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.250
The Shadows?

17:41.167 --> 17:44.458
It's a very dramatic name
but not a very descriptive one.

17:44.542 --> 17:47.083
Their actual name
is 10,000 letters long.

17:47.167 --> 17:51.625
I couldn't pronounce it
if I tried, and I have.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.958
They were quite approachable.

17:54.042 --> 17:56.417
Tell that to
the rest of the crew.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.375
There was an accident.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.458
The crew was killed.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.625
Com system destroyed.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.958
Those of us who survived
had no way to tell Earth

18:14.042 --> 18:15.833
what had happened.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.167
And even if we could have..

18:18.250 --> 18:20.417
...the aliens had just
come out of hibernation.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.708
They were vulnerable.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.667
They couldn't risk
exposure to outsiders.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.000
So they made a deal.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.708
In exchange for our silence..

18:29.792 --> 18:32.542
...they'd let us study
their technology.

18:32.625 --> 18:36.042
John, we have learned things
in the last five years

18:36.125 --> 18:38.417
that will change Earth forever.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.000
Imagine...no more poverty.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.708
Limitless cheap energy,
organic ships.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.208
We could leap ahead
a thousand years.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.667
Ten thousand.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.792
And all you had to do was
let us think you were dead.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.417
It wasn't what I wanted.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.208
Besides, you were the one who
always said our personal lives

18:58.292 --> 19:00.458
had to take second place
to serving Earth.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.708
We didn't realize
how much time had passed.

19:04.792 --> 19:08.750
It doesn't work quite the same
way there as it does here.

19:08.833 --> 19:11.667
But now I'm back, John.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.583
And I've come to
take you back with me.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.042
So you can see for yourself.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.375
So they can tell you
what this is about.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.958
What it's really all about.

19:24.042 --> 19:25.708
Delenn, Kosh, and the others

19:25.792 --> 19:28.792
they have misled you
again and again.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.958
It's time to learn the truth.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.375
You're right.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.917
Maybe it is time.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.208
[instrumental music]

20:04.833 --> 20:06.417
Captain, I heard about..

20:07.958 --> 20:10.042
Well, I heard about Anna.
Anything I can do?

20:10.125 --> 20:13.042
No, thank you.
That situation is well in hand.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.250
But there is something you can
do on another matter.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.583
According to the logs, the
Minbari crew of the White Star

20:17.667 --> 20:19.250
haven't been logged
into the security net.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.667
No, sir.
I figured it wasn't necessary.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.125
Delenn vouched for them.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.625
I understand, but we
should have that information

20:23.708 --> 20:25.250
in case we ever need it.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.958
I want them shuttled over,
processed

20:27.042 --> 20:29.292
given indenticards, the usual.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.750
All of them.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.375
Who's gonna run the ship
while they're here?

20:32.458 --> 20:34.292
The White Star can orbit
the station on autopilot

20:34.375 --> 20:36.000
for a few hours, no problem.

20:37.542 --> 20:39.417
[sighs]
Alright, I guess we can do that.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.875
Anything else?

20:40.958 --> 20:42.375
Yes. While you're at it..

20:42.458 --> 20:45.000
...I need a few things
taken care of.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.417
It's all here.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.708
You will, of course,
keep this confidential.

20:49.792 --> 20:52.667
These days, what around here
isn't confidential?

20:52.750 --> 20:54.458
I'll take care of..

20:58.417 --> 20:59.917
Son of a bitch.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.167
It's against regulations
to address a senior officer

21:02.250 --> 21:04.167
in those terms, Mr. Garibaldi.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.833
Michael..

21:10.417 --> 21:12.375
When I first came here,
I wasn't sure about you

21:12.458 --> 21:14.083
you weren't sure about me.

21:14.167 --> 21:17.250
Since then, I've come
to trust you, to rely on you.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.500
Now, I need you to
take care of this for me.

21:19.583 --> 21:23.917
No questions, no speculations
no hunches, or educated guesses.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.083
Alright?

21:30.250 --> 21:31.417
Yeah.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.750
Good.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.667
And when I see you next..

21:36.750 --> 21:38.667
...if everything is set..

21:40.792 --> 21:42.917
...we'll talk about the weather.

21:45.375 --> 21:47.042
Yes, sir.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.083
[instrumental music]

22:12.083 --> 22:16.500
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

22:24.042 --> 22:27.083
[dramatic music]

22:36.708 --> 22:39.167
Com-system, I want to record
a time-delayed message

22:39.250 --> 22:40.750
for ambassador Delenn.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.083
[beeps]

22:42.167 --> 22:44.250
(automated message)
'Stand by.'

22:51.833 --> 22:53.042
Afternoon, captain.

22:53.125 --> 22:54.917
Mr. Garibaldi.
Is there a problem?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.583
No, just taking a walk.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.833
I, uh, heard
a weather report from earth.

22:58.917 --> 23:00.750
They've had a late winter,
but it...finally started

23:00.833 --> 23:03.583
snowing in New York.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.458
Well, it must be very pretty
there this time of year.

23:06.542 --> 23:08.458
Yes, sir. Must be.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.458
Take care, Michael.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.250
You, too.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.625
[intense music]

23:32.333 --> 23:33.875
Here.

23:35.958 --> 23:38.125
You sure you can
run this thing by yourself?

23:38.208 --> 23:39.333
I think so.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.500
I've watched them
whenever we've gone out.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.583
The ship's control system
is pretty intelligent

23:43.667 --> 23:45.792
so as long as we don't
run into any trouble..

23:45.875 --> 23:47.667
...we should be fine.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.333
You're guaranteed
safe passage.

23:50.417 --> 23:53.125
Well, then let's get this show
on the road, huh?

23:54.167 --> 23:55.500
Next stop..

23:55.583 --> 23:57.417
...Z'ha'dum.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.917
[intense music]

24:09.583 --> 24:12.750
I wish we could've
taken a different ship.

24:12.833 --> 24:15.833
This one's based partially
on Vorlon technology.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.250
The aliens believe they'll die

24:17.333 --> 24:20.250
if anything remotely Vorlon
touches Z'ha'dum.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.500
Then we won't risk it,
when we get there

24:22.583 --> 24:25.375
we'll take the shuttle
down to the surface.

24:32.625 --> 24:35.583
Susan. I just checked the logs.
The captain's gone.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.042
I know, I just found out
about it myself.

24:37.125 --> 24:38.708
I'm running it down now.
There must be a reason.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.542
No, you don't understand.
I mean, why did he do it?

24:40.625 --> 24:43.333
I-I gave him the report.
I know he read it.

24:43.417 --> 24:45.292
What report?

24:45.375 --> 24:47.625
There's a problem with Anna.

24:47.708 --> 24:50.250
[dramatic music]

25:09.333 --> 25:11.458
The entrance is up ahead.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.292
[air hissing]

25:35.583 --> 25:37.750
For security reasons,
they moved their main structures

25:37.833 --> 25:40.250
underground centuries ago.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.292
John, I'll need your gun.

25:46.542 --> 25:49.083
[intense music]

26:01.875 --> 26:05.417
They designed this part of
the complex specifically for us.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.417
Us?

26:07.500 --> 26:09.333
You'll see.

26:21.708 --> 26:24.042
No. Not that door. This one.

26:27.458 --> 26:28.958
[knocks on door]

26:29.042 --> 26:31.208
(male #1)
'Yes. Come in.'

26:35.583 --> 26:37.167
Anna.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.625
You got him
to come back with you.

26:39.708 --> 26:42.583
Excellent.
Just...excellent.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.083
Come in. Please.

26:45.167 --> 26:46.542
Have a seat.

it's chamomile'

if you like.'

26:51.875 --> 26:54.083
'It helps me sleep better.'

26:54.167 --> 26:56.542
Captain, I think
you already know..

26:56.625 --> 26:59.167
- Yes.
- Hello, captain.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.292
Have a seat. Please.

27:01.375 --> 27:02.583
Who are you?

27:02.667 --> 27:06.583
Now...that's really
not...important.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.042
Who are you?

27:08.125 --> 27:11.042
Who decides that the workday
is from nine to five

27:11.125 --> 27:15.042
instead of eleven to four?

27:15.125 --> 27:16.708
Who decides that the hemlines

27:16.792 --> 27:19.208
will be below the knee
this year..

27:19.292 --> 27:22.417
...and short again next year?

27:22.500 --> 27:25.750
Who draws up the borders

27:25.833 --> 27:28.042
controls the currency

27:28.125 --> 27:30.833
handles all of the decisions

27:30.917 --> 27:33.958
that happen transparently
around us?

27:34.042 --> 27:36.125
- I don't know.
- Ah.

27:37.250 --> 27:39.375
I'm...with them.

middle man.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.292
And the name..

27:48.375 --> 27:50.417
...is Justin.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.917
Come in, then. Sit. Sit.

We'd won the war, but Centauri
Prime had been devastated.

You said that this future
couldn't be changed.

28:37.792 --> 28:38.958
You also told me..

28:39.042 --> 28:42.042
Do not go to Z'ha'dum.
Do you understand?

28:42.125 --> 28:44.625
- Do not go to Z'ha'dum!
- Aah!

28:44.708 --> 28:47.125
I began to wonder..

28:47.208 --> 28:49.125
...what if that future happened
because I listened

28:49.208 --> 28:51.250
to your warning
and didn't go to Z'ha'dum?

28:51.333 --> 28:54.917
'What if...what if
I could prevent the fall'

28:55.000 --> 28:58.625
'of Centauri Prime and end
the Shadow War by going there?'

29:00.958 --> 29:06.625
What I want...is to
stay alive...to be with you.

29:06.708 --> 29:09.542
'But you were right before.'

29:09.625 --> 29:12.542
This is about more than
what I want.

29:12.625 --> 29:16.750
So I'm going, even though I know
it's almost certainly a trap.

29:16.833 --> 29:18.500
(Justin)
You see, John..

29:18.583 --> 29:21.417
...back a million years ago..

29:21.500 --> 29:23.333
..there were..

29:23.417 --> 29:27.125
...forces prowling
around the galaxy..

29:27.208 --> 29:31.208
...beyond anything
that we could understand.

29:31.292 --> 29:32.750
And..

29:32.833 --> 29:34.667
...like anything else..

29:34.750 --> 29:38.333
...most of them...outgrew..

29:38.417 --> 29:41.417
'...this little corner
of the universe..'

29:41.500 --> 29:45.333
...and headed off
toward greener pastures.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.500
Now..

29:46.583 --> 29:49.667
...two of them stayed...behind.

29:49.750 --> 29:52.000
'Shepherds,
you might call them.'

29:52.083 --> 29:55.250
They wanted to look after
the younger races

29:55.333 --> 29:56.708
bring them around

29:56.792 --> 30:00.125
help them evolve
into something better.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.292
One of these was the Vorlons.

30:02.375 --> 30:05.458
The other...was what you call
the Shadows.

30:05.542 --> 30:09.042
The Vorlons are like
your parents, I suppose.

30:09.125 --> 30:12.125
They want you to play nice,
clean your room

30:12.208 --> 30:14.292
do it by the rules.

30:14.375 --> 30:18.083
I guess you could call them
"Lords of order."

30:18.167 --> 30:20.333
The others,
the ones who live here

30:20.417 --> 30:23.917
believe that strength...
only comes from conflict.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.542
They want to release
our potential, not bottle it up.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.625
(Justin)
It's really simple.

30:29.708 --> 30:32.250
You...bring two sides
together.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.000
They fight.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.250
A lot of them die.

30:36.333 --> 30:40.125
But those who survive
are stronger

30:40.208 --> 30:42.000
smarter, and better.

30:42.083 --> 30:45.292
It's like...knocking over
an ant hill.

30:45.375 --> 30:48.250
Every new generation
gets stronger.

30:48.333 --> 30:51.292
The ant hill gets redesigned.

30:51.375 --> 30:53.458
Made better.

30:53.542 --> 30:56.250
So that's what the Shadows do.

30:56.333 --> 30:58.417
Come out every
few thousand years

30:58.500 --> 31:00.833
and kick over
all the ant hills.

31:00.917 --> 31:02.583
Start wars..

31:02.667 --> 31:04.250
...destroy entire races.

31:04.333 --> 31:08.333
A few get lost
along the way...yes.

31:08.417 --> 31:10.250
And that's unfortunate.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.583
I don't think
it was ever easy

31:12.667 --> 31:17.333
but you can't let that
get in the way of the dream.

31:18.750 --> 31:21.292
Commander, I'm picking up
a disturbance.

31:21.375 --> 31:24.000
- Location?
- 'All around us.'

31:25.625 --> 31:28.167
[intense music]

31:33.250 --> 31:35.458
Red alert! Red alert!

31:39.042 --> 31:42.083
[dramatic music]

31:42.167 --> 31:44.208
[alarm wails]

31:46.708 --> 31:48.958
- Status.
- They're not moving.

31:49.042 --> 31:50.792
Holding position.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.792
All fighter squadrons launch,
but do not approach

31:52.875 --> 31:54.875
until authorized to fire.

32:01.458 --> 32:03.708
Think about it, captain.

32:03.792 --> 32:07.208
Look at the long history
of human struggle.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.750
Six thousand years
of recorded wars.

32:10.833 --> 32:13.583
Bloodshed, atrocities
beyond description.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.875
But look at what came
out of all of that.

32:17.958 --> 32:20.125
We've gone to the stars.

32:20.208 --> 32:21.917
Split the atom.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.708
Written sonnets.

32:23.792 --> 32:25.125
We never would've come this far

32:25.208 --> 32:27.000
if we hadn't been
at each other's throats

32:27.083 --> 32:30.375
evolving...our way up..

32:30.458 --> 32:32.167
...inch by inch.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.250
(Anna)
It was supposed to be
an equal balance

32:34.333 --> 32:36.542
between our side
and the Vorlons.

32:36.625 --> 32:40.583
But the Vorlons decided that
their way was the right way.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.875
They enlisted the support
of other worlds..

32:42.958 --> 32:45.583
like...the Minbari.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.292
They even started interfering

32:47.375 --> 32:49.625
with the development
of younger races.

32:49.708 --> 32:52.208
When you look at a Vorlon

32:52.292 --> 32:54.833
you see what
they want you to see.

32:54.917 --> 32:58.958
They've manipulated us so we'd
respond favorably to them.

32:59.042 --> 33:01.958
They've even interfered...
at a genetic level

33:02.042 --> 33:05.792
taking humans
them.

33:05.875 --> 33:09.208
Why do you think certifiable
telepaths came out of nowhere

33:09.292 --> 33:10.708
a hundred years ago?

33:10.792 --> 33:14.500
They created telepaths
on a hundred worlds

33:14.583 --> 33:16.625
to use as cannon fodder
for the next war

33:16.708 --> 33:19.375
but fortunately,
our friends got there first

33:19.458 --> 33:22.083
'and, with the help
of the Psi Corps'

33:22.167 --> 33:26.083
'made sure that they came out
on our side.'

33:26.167 --> 33:28.125
'John, they think that'

33:28.208 --> 33:30.583
'the human race shows
great potential.'

33:30.667 --> 33:34.708
'When all this is over,
we can be riding high.'

33:34.792 --> 33:38.333
The first to rebuild,
making things our own way.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.875
But the only thing that's
standing in our way now is you.

33:41.958 --> 33:45.917
'So we can either
work together now..'

33:46.000 --> 33:49.333
'...or we can remove
your support mechanism.'

33:51.208 --> 33:53.750
[intense music]

33:57.625 --> 34:00.458
Moving into position.
Everybody, hang tight.

34:00.542 --> 34:04.125
- Can you get through to Draal?
- Negative. They're jamming us.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.042
I don't understand.
They're just sitting there.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.250
This has got
to have something to do

34:07.333 --> 34:08.667
with the captain, but what?

34:08.750 --> 34:10.125
What are they waiting for?

34:10.208 --> 34:12.208
Everything depends on getting

34:12.292 --> 34:14.292
the other races
to fight each other

34:14.375 --> 34:18.667
to create conflict in order to
promote growth and evolution.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.208
By getting them to cooperate

34:20.292 --> 34:22.958
you are working
against that goal.

34:23.042 --> 34:25.750
Whenever this starts,
there's always someone who tries

34:25.833 --> 34:28.000
to organize the other races.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.333
You've done it.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.958
That's a commendable
achievement.

34:31.042 --> 34:33.167
But as far as our goals
are concerned..

34:33.250 --> 34:34.750
'...unproductive.'

34:34.833 --> 34:36.417
So, why don't you just kill me?

34:36.500 --> 34:37.750
(Justin)
Doesn't work.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.250
Somebody'd just come
around and replace you.

34:40.333 --> 34:43.625
'That's always been the trouble
with creating martyrs.'

34:43.708 --> 34:48.875
We've brought you here
hoping you'd understand us.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.542
Work with us.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.083
Not against us.

34:52.167 --> 34:55.000
You're important.
You're what they call a nexus.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.875
You turn one way,
and the whole world

34:56.958 --> 35:00.417
has a tendency
to go the same way.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.792
Let...go

35:02.875 --> 35:04.208
of those other races.

35:04.292 --> 35:06.083
You can't hold them together.

35:06.167 --> 35:09.750
Evolution will be served
one way or another.

35:09.833 --> 35:12.125
So you can work with us, or--

35:12.208 --> 35:14.792
Or you'll do to me
what you did to Anna.

35:20.042 --> 35:21.083
I don't know what you're..

35:21.167 --> 35:22.667
All the memories are there.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.667
The voice is there.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.667
'The DNA is there.'

35:28.875 --> 35:30.583
But the personality..

35:32.458 --> 35:35.042
I look in her eyes,
and the woman I love

35:35.125 --> 35:38.917
the woman...I married..

35:39.000 --> 35:41.083
...isn't there.

35:44.042 --> 35:48.042
She would never
go along with this.

35:48.125 --> 35:50.375
You're right.

35:50.458 --> 35:52.208
Just so.

35:52.292 --> 35:55.000
'You see, when she came here
five years ago'

35:55.083 --> 35:56.375
'she was given the choice'

35:56.458 --> 35:59.167
'the same choice
that we're giving you.'

35:59.250 --> 36:02.042
She made the mistake
of choosing badly.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.875
You stuck her in one
of those ships, didn't you?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.292
How did you know?

36:11.375 --> 36:13.083
A few months ago, we intercepted
a ship full of people

36:13.167 --> 36:16.917
who were going to be merged
with the Shadow vessels.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.875
They had implants in
the brain stem, right back here.

36:20.958 --> 36:24.292
'Scars in the back of her head
are in exactly the same place.'

36:24.375 --> 36:26.917
Our associates
needed fresh bodies

36:27.000 --> 36:31.167
for the central processing units
in their ships.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.958
But we pulled her out
as soon as we found out

36:34.042 --> 36:36.958
who she was and who you are.

36:37.042 --> 36:40.375
But once you've been
inside of one of those ships

36:40.458 --> 36:42.458
for a while..

36:42.542 --> 36:44.250
...you're never..

36:44.333 --> 36:46.208
...quite whole..

36:46.292 --> 36:47.417
'...again.'

36:47.500 --> 36:49.417
'But you do what you're told!'

36:51.333 --> 36:53.250
And so will you!

36:57.333 --> 37:00.125
- Commander!
- 'G'Kar, good.'

37:00.208 --> 37:01.375
Can we get those nuclear weapons

37:01.458 --> 37:02.833
outside where
they can do some good?

37:02.917 --> 37:04.667
I'm afraid not,
even if we could get them out

37:04.750 --> 37:07.917
at this range, they'd vaporize
us right along with the enemy.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.708
Maybe...how many of those bombs
do we have?

37:09.792 --> 37:12.375
That's what I came to tell you.
Two of the devices are missing.

37:12.458 --> 37:13.792
What?

John.

38:15.958 --> 38:19.000
There's nowhere to run.

38:19.083 --> 38:21.875
Come back inside.
We can work this out.

38:28.458 --> 38:31.958
I know that this isn't
the Anna that you knew.

38:32.042 --> 38:35.417
What I am is what
her..

38:35.500 --> 38:37.208
...a new personality.

38:38.375 --> 38:40.292
'She can never come back.'

38:41.792 --> 38:44.708
But I can love you
as well as she did.

40:09.542 --> 40:12.208
I don't get it.
What happened?

40:12.292 --> 40:14.042
They wouldn't just leave.

40:14.125 --> 40:16.667
Unless we were
no longer a threat.

(G'Kar)
It was the end
of the Earth year 2260.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.750
And the war had paused..

40:39.833 --> 40:43.583
...suddenly and unexpectedly.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.000
All around us..

40:55.083 --> 40:59.667
...it was as if the universe
were holding its breath.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.667
Waiting.

41:04.958 --> 41:09.292
All of life can be broken down
into moments of transition

41:09.375 --> 41:11.708
or moments..

41:11.792 --> 41:13.708
...of revelation.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.833
This had the feeling of both.

41:26.333 --> 41:27.708
Commander?

41:29.042 --> 41:30.917
Any word on the captain?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.375
Anything at all?

41:32.458 --> 41:34.417
We've tried everything.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.458
The White Star isn't receiving.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.583
As far as we can tell..

41:39.667 --> 41:41.417
...it's been destroyed.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.208
'There's...something else.'

41:46.458 --> 41:48.208
We checked the fighter bays.

41:48.292 --> 41:51.125
One of the fighters
we sent out didn't come back.

41:53.958 --> 41:55.417
Who was the pilot?

41:56.875 --> 41:58.792
Mr. Garibaldi.
