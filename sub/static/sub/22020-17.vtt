WEBVTT

00:01.633 --> 00:04.436
The violence in Chicago has
now touched elected officials.

00:04.469 --> 00:07.105
Outspoken Alderman James Burton
of the 24th ward

00:07.139 --> 00:08.641
was gunned down this morning

00:08.673 --> 00:10.709
- in the financial district.
- Streets and Sanitation worker

00:10.743 --> 00:12.310
found him an hour ago.

00:12.343 --> 00:15.814
GSW to the head,
T.O.D. between 2:00 a.m.,

00:15.848 --> 00:17.382
3:00 a.m. based on lividity.

00:17.416 --> 00:19.352
- Witnesses?
- No one's come forward.

00:19.385 --> 00:21.621
Yeah, this place is
really dead after hours, Sarge.

00:21.653 --> 00:23.388
I doubt anybody was here.

00:23.422 --> 00:25.257
Pockets turned inside and out.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.292
Wallet, watch, and cell phone are gone.

00:27.326 --> 00:28.628
Any signs of a struggle?

00:28.661 --> 00:31.264
Nope, looks like a robbery gone wrong.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.666
Know what Alderman Burton
was doing down here?

00:33.698 --> 00:35.400
Drinking at the Crown Pub.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.335
Bartender said he was with a banker,

00:37.368 --> 00:39.204
Rudy Finnegan, till closing.

00:39.237 --> 00:40.839
We'll go talk to him.

00:40.872 --> 00:42.474
I heard this alderman said

00:42.508 --> 00:44.644
cops only care about white victims.

00:44.676 --> 00:46.179
I'd love to tell this jackass

00:46.212 --> 00:47.413
I'm working double overtime

00:47.445 --> 00:49.481
to help find the guy who killed him.

00:50.149 --> 00:51.384
Hank.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.753
Hey, that's great news
about your daughter.

00:53.786 --> 00:55.288
I hear she's going to be okay.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.690
Yeah, doctors did a great job.

00:58.723 --> 01:00.292
- Burton, huh?
- Yeah.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.561
You know he and the mayor
were very close friends.

01:02.594 --> 01:05.197
Yeah, the mayor would like
your team to work this quick.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.565
Understood.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.600
Detective Olinsky.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.539
We'd like a word.

01:15.808 --> 01:18.277
What's this about?

01:18.310 --> 01:20.680
Not here. Down at headquarters.

01:21.579 --> 01:22.527
It's important, Al.

01:22.559 --> 01:25.005
- We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Get off me, man.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.760 --> 01:37.097
What the hell is this about?

01:52.510 --> 01:54.212
Thanks for coming in, Detective Olinsky.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.447
So why am I here?

01:55.480 --> 01:57.382
We need to ask you some questions.

01:57.415 --> 01:59.685
- About?
- Kevin Bingham.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.257
He murdered Hank Voight's son.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.459
They dug his body up about six weeks ago

02:06.492 --> 02:08.759
at a Super Mart construction site.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.530
So?

02:10.562 --> 02:12.298
You meet the guy?

02:13.932 --> 02:15.367
Okay, look.

02:15.401 --> 02:19.605
Third party DNA was found
on Bingham's body.

02:19.638 --> 02:20.740
Yours.

02:22.241 --> 02:23.476
Al.

02:23.508 --> 02:25.377
Can you explain how your hair

02:25.411 --> 02:27.413
ended up on the victim?

02:29.548 --> 02:31.769
Lawyer.

02:32.933 --> 02:36.815

02:36.870 --> 02:38.790
I was with Alderman Burton
for about two hours.

02:38.824 --> 02:42.428
He wanted me to invest in some
urban revitalization project

02:42.461 --> 02:44.397
- in his ward.
- At midnight?

02:44.430 --> 02:48.534
Oh, yeah, he insisted
that we meet after dinner.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.203
He seemed desperate for cash.

02:50.235 --> 02:51.469
What do you mean?

02:51.502 --> 02:53.939
Well, he offered to pay 15% interest.

02:53.973 --> 02:55.575
That's double the market rate.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.343
We're friends, but that made me nervous.

02:57.376 --> 02:58.811
So I, uh, passed.

02:58.843 --> 03:00.812
Oh.

03:00.846 --> 03:03.682
Then I got in my Uber

03:03.716 --> 03:06.586
at 2:01

03:06.618 --> 03:09.222
at the bar, and Burton
went down the street.

03:09.254 --> 03:10.622
You see anything suspicious?

03:10.656 --> 03:13.725
No. There was a guy at the bar earlier.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.360
African-American, came in,

03:15.394 --> 03:16.829
looked around for a few minutes,

03:16.861 --> 03:17.963
left without ordering.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.399
Any details on that? Age, height?

03:20.431 --> 03:23.268
Eh, late twenties,
average height and build.

03:25.503 --> 03:26.972
You think of anything else,
give us a call, okay?

03:27.006 --> 03:29.574
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for calling.

03:29.608 --> 03:30.843
Hey, by the way, why do you think

03:30.876 --> 03:32.611
that IAD picked up Olinsky?

03:32.645 --> 03:33.879
I don't know.

03:33.912 --> 03:36.248
With Olinsky, you may never know.

03:37.415 --> 03:39.585
So anything you need, anything at all,

03:39.617 --> 03:41.519
you have my private number.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.889
I know you and James had doubts
about our police,

03:43.921 --> 03:45.858
but we're changing things.

03:45.890 --> 03:48.927
You'll be in good hands
with Sergeant Voight here.

03:48.961 --> 03:50.563
Thank you, Denny.

03:50.596 --> 03:52.998
- All right.
- Thank you.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.800
Commander.

03:54.832 --> 03:57.669
- We're so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

03:57.703 --> 04:00.473
It's a loss for everyone,
the entire city.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.040
- It is.
- Um.

04:02.074 --> 04:03.643
Sorry to do this now,

04:03.675 --> 04:06.645
but your husband's
personal items were stolen.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.647
And if you tell me what they
are, if you describe them,

04:08.681 --> 04:11.284
we may be able to track down
the offender who stole them.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.286
You think this was a stupid robbery?

04:13.318 --> 04:15.287
Mom, she's just trying to do her job...

04:15.320 --> 04:16.622
My husband was a leader.

04:16.654 --> 04:19.457
A visionary, he was
transforming this ward

04:19.490 --> 04:21.360
into a vibrant, bustling community.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.795
He didn't die over some damn Rolex.

04:23.829 --> 04:26.564
My father passed an ordinance last year.

04:26.598 --> 04:28.567
Uh, developers of blighted areas

04:28.600 --> 04:30.970
don't have to pay
property taxes for five years.

04:31.002 --> 04:33.639
Guess some of the locals
weren't too happy about that.

04:33.672 --> 04:35.641
Yes, they protested on our front lawn,

04:35.673 --> 04:38.777
slashed our tires, made death threats.

04:38.810 --> 04:39.911
Did you get any names?

04:39.944 --> 04:41.447
The ward secretary kept track

04:41.480 --> 04:43.716
of all the angry calls and emails.

04:44.583 --> 04:47.320
- Thank you, ma'am, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

04:50.555 --> 04:52.057
Hey, we got a list of pissed-off locals

04:52.091 --> 04:54.660
from the alderman's secretary.
There's at least 50 names.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.394
We weren't able to get video
of the male black

04:56.427 --> 04:57.797
Finnegan saw at the Crown Pub.

04:57.829 --> 04:59.899
What about the alderman's
personal belongings?

04:59.932 --> 05:02.568
His phone has no signal,
no hits on his credit cards,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.737
and his Rolex hasn't popped
up in any pawn shops yet.

05:04.769 --> 05:07.406
I thought you should know
the alderman's wife is on TV

05:07.439 --> 05:09.975
expressing concern
about Chicago PD's dedication

05:10.007 --> 05:11.443
to black politicians.

05:11.476 --> 05:12.544
It's been like what, five hours?

05:12.577 --> 05:13.878
Why is she going so hard at this?

05:13.911 --> 05:16.548
She's smart. She wants
to keep the pressure on.

05:16.581 --> 05:18.416
All right, so run the names
of the angry locals.

05:18.449 --> 05:20.952
But don't give up
on this robbery angle either.

05:20.985 --> 05:22.454
Listen, Adam.

05:23.788 --> 05:25.690
I want you to reach out to Woods.

05:25.723 --> 05:28.093
See if he knows what's going on with Al.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.096
You haven't talked to him?

05:30.129 --> 05:31.664
Still out of touch.

05:31.697 --> 05:33.833
Well, that's not a good sign.

05:33.865 --> 05:35.435
All right.

05:37.735 --> 05:38.971
Hey.

05:39.004 --> 05:42.141
I pulled foreign hair
and fibers from the body

05:42.173 --> 05:43.975
doing the DNA analysis.

05:44.009 --> 05:47.814
Cause of death,
single gunshot to the head.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.082
This is the recovered bullet.

05:51.115 --> 05:55.754
It's a hollow point .223
caliber from assault rifle.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.122
Probably AR-15.

05:57.156 --> 05:58.723
Entry wound is clean.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.994
No soot, powder tattooing,
internal cavitation.

06:02.026 --> 06:03.461
So it was fired from a distance.

06:03.495 --> 06:05.398
- That's right.
- So someone

06:05.430 --> 06:06.798
sniped the alderman from far away

06:06.831 --> 06:08.500
and then they get close to rob him.

06:08.533 --> 06:09.735
That doesn't make any sense.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.936
Yeah, you're right. It doesn't.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.672
Unless it was a hit.

06:13.704 --> 06:17.877
And a robbery was just to throw
us off the scent, right?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.746
- Thanks.
- Mm.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.485
Commander.

06:26.517 --> 06:29.020
Commander!

06:29.053 --> 06:30.455
I sent a few texts.

06:30.488 --> 06:31.790
I don't know if they went through.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.794
No, I got them. Why are you here?

06:34.826 --> 06:38.531
I, uh, heard that IA picked up Olinsky.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.734
Does this got something
to do with Bingham?

06:41.766 --> 06:43.067
Look, sir, I'm just trying to help.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.502
Just trying to work off my case,

06:44.536 --> 06:46.738
and Voight, he seems real nervous.

06:46.771 --> 06:48.173
I think this could
be a good opportunity.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.507
So if there's
something you want me to do,

06:49.540 --> 06:51.709
I'm ready for you.

06:51.742 --> 06:53.711
Don't contact me again, ever.

06:53.745 --> 06:54.446
Sir.

06:54.478 --> 06:57.416
If I need you, I will find you.

06:58.516 --> 06:59.617
Yes, sir.

07:02.553 --> 07:05.490
- He shut you down.
- He was ice cold.

07:05.524 --> 07:06.925
'Cause he doesn't need you anymore.

07:06.959 --> 07:10.062
Which means whatever
he's got on Olinsky is real.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.765
We ran the foreign DNA
on the alderman's body.

07:12.798 --> 07:14.500
It's a match to Darius Brown

07:14.533 --> 07:16.669
who also lives in Burton's ward.

07:16.701 --> 07:18.771
- Priors?
- One for assault.

07:18.803 --> 07:20.705
Beat the hell out
of his landlord six months ago

07:20.738 --> 07:21.940
'cause he tried to double the rent.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.908
Tell me you got a current address.

07:23.942 --> 07:25.545
We do.

07:27.278 --> 07:28.680
Chicago PD!

07:29.714 --> 07:31.182
All right, it's open.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.190
On your right. Okay.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.879
Darius Brown!

08:04.115 --> 08:05.884
Was I too loud, Officer?

08:11.857 --> 08:14.760
They found your DNA on Bingham's body?

08:15.994 --> 08:17.497
Yeah.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.032
What'd you say?

08:23.735 --> 08:26.072
I said I wanted a lawyer,
and the meeting was over.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.643
Anyone in mind?

08:30.675 --> 08:32.878
Yeah, Peter Manetti.

08:32.909 --> 08:34.145
He's good.

08:34.178 --> 08:36.881
Expensive, too.

08:36.914 --> 08:39.017
100 grand, up front.

08:44.188 --> 08:45.857
Listen, man, I...

08:47.793 --> 08:49.861
I hate to ask, but...

08:52.331 --> 08:55.801
I might need to borrow some
money from your Rainy Day fund.

08:55.833 --> 08:59.838
Al, I put all that money in
a trust fund for my grandson.

09:06.043 --> 09:07.779
When they dug up Bingham's body,

09:07.835 --> 09:10.286
I figured I could get arrested
at any minute, so...

09:13.384 --> 09:15.645
Man.

09:31.415 --> 09:33.984
When I found him, he was already dead.

09:34.018 --> 09:35.787
I didn't know he was an alderman.

09:35.819 --> 09:38.055
All right, so you just
happened to walk up to a body

09:38.088 --> 09:40.624
in the middle of the night
in the financial district?

09:40.658 --> 09:42.060
I was walking home.

09:42.092 --> 09:44.362
And I heard a gunshot,
so I went to look.

09:44.395 --> 09:46.130
I saw this dude in the alley, bleeding,

09:46.164 --> 09:47.631
but he was dead.

09:47.664 --> 09:49.568
How do you know that?

09:49.601 --> 09:51.535
- I just knew.
- Okay.

09:51.568 --> 09:53.104
Did you rob him?

09:53.138 --> 09:54.639
Rob him?

09:54.672 --> 09:56.475
Now, that would be disrespectful.

09:58.175 --> 10:00.778
Sorry to interrupt. Darius.

10:00.812 --> 10:03.148
Look what I found in your apartment.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.049
Well, that was
excellent timing right there

10:05.082 --> 10:06.952
because Darius was just telling us

10:06.985 --> 10:08.620
how he didn't rob the alderman.

10:08.653 --> 10:10.654
No, I never said I didn't rob him.

10:10.688 --> 10:11.822
- Ah.
- I said robbing him

10:11.856 --> 10:13.091
would be disrespectful.

10:13.124 --> 10:15.861
- There's a difference.
- Oh, my God.

10:15.894 --> 10:18.096
Did you steal his phone? His Rolex?

10:20.130 --> 10:21.533
Of course I did.

10:21.566 --> 10:23.402
What? The man was dead.

10:23.434 --> 10:25.069
Ain't like he needed to know
what time it was.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.072
But that don't mean I killed the man.

10:27.105 --> 10:29.941
No, but it looks pretty good.

10:29.973 --> 10:31.809
And unless you tell me something helpful

10:31.842 --> 10:33.645
I'm gonna charge your ass right now

10:33.678 --> 10:35.080
with murder.

10:37.081 --> 10:39.683
Okay, when I was walking up to the body,

10:39.717 --> 10:41.620
I saw a blue sedan.

10:41.653 --> 10:43.822
A Chrysler, I think.

10:43.855 --> 10:45.190
It was driving away too fast.

10:45.222 --> 10:47.425
- You see who was in the car?
- I couldn't see.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.726
It was dark.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.163
Look, I swear to God
I did not kill that man.

10:51.196 --> 10:52.264
Mm-kay.

10:52.297 --> 10:54.166
Well, just to be sure,
we're going to keep you here

10:54.198 --> 10:55.666
for a little while, so get comfortable.

10:55.699 --> 10:56.867
C'mon.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.438
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

11:01.105 --> 11:03.108
So, boss, this is the good news.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.843
There's only 5,260 blue Chrysler sedans

11:05.876 --> 11:07.813
- in the city of Chicago.
- All right, run the ones

11:07.846 --> 11:10.015
registered to people living in the 54th.

11:10.048 --> 11:12.217
Did that. It narrowed it down to 832.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.552
Huh. It is what it is.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.587
Run the names, see what you find.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.721
Hey, guys, check this out.

11:17.755 --> 11:21.025
This is a voicemail
from Alderman Burton's phone.

11:21.058 --> 11:23.895
<i>You are a greedy,
opportunistic hypocrite</i>

11:23.928 --> 11:25.563
<i>and deserve to die.</i>

11:25.596 --> 11:27.631
That was left last night
just before 11:00 p.m.,

11:27.664 --> 11:28.766
and the call came from a pay phone

11:28.799 --> 11:29.967
at a Douglas Park diner.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.069
Grab Upton. Check it out.

11:34.639 --> 11:35.874
This is the place.

11:35.906 --> 11:37.208
No security cameras.

11:37.241 --> 11:38.610
Yeah.

11:38.643 --> 11:40.045
Excuse me, sir.

11:40.812 --> 11:42.047
Are you the owner of this place?

11:42.079 --> 11:43.747
- I am.
- I'm Detective Upton.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.149
This is Detective Halstead.

11:45.183 --> 11:47.152
We're investigating a homicide.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.020
Did you see somebody use
that pay phone last night

11:49.053 --> 11:50.755
just before closing time?

11:50.788 --> 11:53.158
Uh, can't say that I did.

11:53.991 --> 11:56.160
Will you take a listen
to something for us?

11:57.127 --> 11:58.529
<i>You are a greedy,</i>

11:58.563 --> 11:59.931
<i>opportunistic hypocrite</i>

11:59.963 --> 12:01.732
<i>and deserve to die.</i>

12:01.765 --> 12:03.635
You recognize that voice?

12:03.668 --> 12:05.504
Can't say that I do.

12:05.537 --> 12:06.771
Right.

12:06.803 --> 12:09.507
- Well, thank you for your time.
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.774
Uh-oh.

12:10.808 --> 12:12.544
- What?
- I just saw a rat.

12:12.577 --> 12:14.645
Looks like it ran right
into the kitchen.

12:14.678 --> 12:16.615
You know what they say,
when there's one rat,

12:16.648 --> 12:17.816
there's always more.

12:17.848 --> 12:19.283
Yeah, and then we got to call it in

12:19.317 --> 12:20.818
to the Health Department.

12:20.851 --> 12:22.853
Uh, let me listen to that message again.

12:22.886 --> 12:24.121
Maybe something will click this time.

12:24.154 --> 12:25.756
I like where your head's at.

12:25.789 --> 12:28.760
<i>You are a greedy,
opportunistic hypocrite</i>

12:28.793 --> 12:30.794
<i>and deserve to die.</i>

12:30.827 --> 12:32.831
Kind of sounds like Coleman Lewis.

12:32.864 --> 12:34.165
He's a regular.

12:34.197 --> 12:36.534
Very passionate about the neighborhood.

12:36.568 --> 12:38.904
Wants to keep things the way they are.

12:38.937 --> 12:40.539
Hm.

12:40.572 --> 12:42.072
Thank you.

12:42.106 --> 12:44.109
Make sure you call that exterminator.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.215
Yeah, you better believe that was me.

12:51.249 --> 12:52.951
Okay, sounds like you admit

12:52.984 --> 12:54.986
to threatening to kill
Alderman Burton to me.

12:55.019 --> 12:57.221
I said he deserved to die.

12:57.255 --> 12:58.822
And I stand by that.

12:58.856 --> 13:00.558
- But I didn't kill him.
- Okay, well,

13:00.592 --> 13:02.126
Professor, we just want
to hear the rest of the story.

13:02.159 --> 13:06.063
So you are a music professor
with a gun permit?

13:06.096 --> 13:09.266
You got pinched for vandalizing a car?

13:09.299 --> 13:11.770
Some developer parks his brand new Lexus

13:11.803 --> 13:13.672
in my driveway.

13:13.704 --> 13:16.740
Blocks me in for two hours.

13:16.774 --> 13:19.010
He has no regard whatsoever for me

13:19.043 --> 13:21.279
or any of the residents
in my apartment building.

13:21.312 --> 13:23.748
Now, you guys tell me,
do you really believe

13:23.780 --> 13:26.183
that I'm the one that killed Burton?

13:26.217 --> 13:28.986
I wasn't even in town last night.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.054
Where were you?

13:30.087 --> 13:31.589
I was driving to Pittsburgh.

13:31.622 --> 13:33.057
Pittsburgh? What's in Pittsburgh?

13:33.091 --> 13:34.693
The rare books library
at Carnegie Mellon.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.294
There was a gospel manuscript
I wanted to see.

13:36.327 --> 13:38.897
- Hm.
- Burton was gonna demolish

13:38.929 --> 13:40.998
the Low Note Blues Club,
if you can believe that.

13:41.031 --> 13:43.601
All right? It is one
of the most iconic venues

13:43.635 --> 13:47.005
in this country, and the
greatest people played there.

13:47.038 --> 13:49.341
Okay, so you didn't do it.

13:49.374 --> 13:50.642
Who did?

13:50.674 --> 13:52.176
Who knows?

13:53.044 --> 13:54.913
Burton and his son play dirty.

13:54.946 --> 13:56.715
Plenty of people
that are angry with them.

13:56.747 --> 14:00.017
His son, Arthur? What does
he have to do with anything?

14:01.218 --> 14:03.654
He's the developer
on the Low Note project.

14:05.255 --> 14:08.827
- Hmm. That I didn't know.
- Oh, yeah, well.

14:08.860 --> 14:11.363
Daddy gave junior a plum prize.

14:11.395 --> 14:14.164
Even re-zoned things to make it
nice and easy for him.

14:14.197 --> 14:17.302
You said they were dirty.
I mean, you got any proof?

14:17.335 --> 14:19.904
I've seen Arthur go
into the Roadside Bar,

14:19.937 --> 14:23.842
- two, maybe three times.
- So?

14:23.875 --> 14:26.077
It's a gang hangout.

14:29.279 --> 14:31.182
<i>The Roadside Bar? Yeah.</i>

14:31.215 --> 14:32.684
I've stopped in there for a drink.

14:32.717 --> 14:34.318
It's near a project of mine.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.188
- The Low Note?
- That's the one.

14:37.221 --> 14:40.191
Which your father had re-zoned for you.

14:40.223 --> 14:43.327
You think I got special favors?

14:43.361 --> 14:46.331
Let me tell you, nobody
wanted the Low Note.

14:46.364 --> 14:49.000
Junkies shoot up
in the lobby over there.

14:49.033 --> 14:51.403
What are you getting at anyway?

14:51.436 --> 14:53.738
Did you and your father
have any side deals

14:53.770 --> 14:55.373
related to that project?

14:56.374 --> 14:59.010
Listen, Arthur, if you're
involved with a local gang...

14:59.043 --> 15:00.845
What the hell does that mean?

15:00.877 --> 15:03.247
Involved with a local gang?

15:03.280 --> 15:06.083
Are you suggesting that my son,

15:06.116 --> 15:09.286
my Ivy League-educated son,
is a gangbanger?

15:09.319 --> 15:10.888
No, ma'am, I'm just trying to figure out

15:10.922 --> 15:12.090
who killed your husband.

15:12.122 --> 15:13.323
And right now we don't have

15:13.356 --> 15:15.260
a whole lot of leads, so the more I know

15:15.293 --> 15:17.861
about your family's
business dealings the better.

15:17.895 --> 15:21.265
I'm quickly losing faith
in you, Sergeant Voight.

15:21.298 --> 15:23.168
Maybe I should let Denny Woods know

15:23.201 --> 15:26.271
that you're more focused
on tearing my family down

15:26.303 --> 15:28.673
than finding my husband's killer.

15:30.741 --> 15:33.077
We're done here.

15:41.151 --> 15:43.253
Platt, do you know what's
going on with Al?

15:43.287 --> 15:45.090
Does it have to do with Bingham's body?

15:45.122 --> 15:46.957
- I am not the guy to ask.
- Hey, Antonio.

15:46.991 --> 15:50.095
- Coleman Lewis' alibi check out?
- Yeah, sure does.

15:50.127 --> 15:51.361
He was at Carnegie Mellon checking out

15:51.395 --> 15:53.030
rare books early that morning.

15:53.063 --> 15:54.765
Timeline isn't perfect,
but it's pretty tight.

15:54.798 --> 15:56.467
And we have
a forensic accountant looking

15:56.500 --> 15:58.269
into Burton family finances.

15:58.302 --> 15:59.904
All right, good.
Let me know what you find.

15:59.937 --> 16:02.072
- Okay.
- Voight.

16:02.106 --> 16:04.008
Hold on.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.309
Yeah.

16:06.943 --> 16:09.745
We'll be right there.

16:10.881 --> 16:14.708
Arthur Burton was supposed to
meet a contractor here at 3:00.

16:14.724 --> 16:15.859
Contractor was late.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.962
Found him dead when he arrived.

16:17.994 --> 16:21.130
- Any witnesses?
- None so far.

16:21.163 --> 16:24.935
Single shot to the head,
just like his father.

16:26.769 --> 16:29.306
Thanks, Novick.

16:50.326 --> 16:53.931
Man, this isn't
about yoga studios or condos

16:53.964 --> 16:56.250
or destroying black culture.

16:56.666 --> 16:59.461
We're standing in the middle
of the heroin highway.

16:59.802 --> 17:02.172
This is about drugs.

17:04.306 --> 17:07.303
This old blues club gets torn down,

17:07.580 --> 17:09.450
condos put up,

17:09.848 --> 17:12.357
it would screw up
their whole business model.

17:24.616 --> 17:25.818
Thank you, ma'am.

17:36.758 --> 17:38.894
I never changed his room.

17:38.929 --> 17:41.432
Not since the day he left for college.

17:42.665 --> 17:44.367
I'm so sorry.

17:44.401 --> 17:47.238
We named him after King Arthur.

17:47.270 --> 17:51.274
I apologize, but I need to
ask you about some things.

17:53.676 --> 17:55.778
Have you ever heard
of the heroin highway?

17:55.811 --> 17:58.248
That's where folks from
the suburbs buys drugs.

17:58.281 --> 18:00.483
Pay on one end, pick up
the product on the other.

18:00.517 --> 18:01.717
Back home in no time.

18:01.741 --> 18:06.013
My husband and I grew up
with gangs, with drugs.

18:06.047 --> 18:10.250
I've seen the violence and
the pain up close and personal.

18:10.283 --> 18:14.354
I lost my sister to all that
nonsense when I was just a kid.

18:14.387 --> 18:17.324
Yeah, I know how it works.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.625
I know the rules.

18:18.658 --> 18:20.761
Do you think Arthur knew the rules?

18:20.795 --> 18:24.132
He knew the gang wasn't
in favor of the project.

18:24.164 --> 18:27.734
But James and Arthur told me
they worked it out.

18:27.768 --> 18:30.047
Came to some sort of an arrangement.

18:30.094 --> 18:31.296
Do you know what that was?

18:31.328 --> 18:33.397
No, they didn't go into details.

18:33.431 --> 18:35.600
They just said they took care
of the problem.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.002
Look, the LLC your husband
and son formed

18:38.036 --> 18:43.074
made several cash payments to
a guy named Lincoln Avanzano.

18:43.107 --> 18:45.143
But he doesn't seem to exist.

18:45.175 --> 18:47.945
You think that's how
they handled the problem?

18:47.979 --> 18:50.282
Paid off the gang?

18:50.315 --> 18:52.284
It's possible.

18:52.317 --> 18:54.920
And what gang do you think it would be?

18:55.552 --> 18:58.357
The Westside Disciples.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.195
Don't know Alderman Burton or his kid.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.198
Well, they're both dead now.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.532
Mm.

19:08.566 --> 19:10.935
- That's too bad.
- Mm-hmm.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.105
Word is, they tried to work a deal

19:14.137 --> 19:16.441
with the Westside Disciples.

19:16.473 --> 19:18.175
That's your gang.

19:18.209 --> 19:20.178
- Is that right?
- Gave you cash

19:20.211 --> 19:22.579
so you wouldn't interfere with
their construction project.

19:22.613 --> 19:24.482
Don't know nothing about that.

19:24.514 --> 19:26.650
That's hard to believe.

19:26.684 --> 19:29.320
I mean, you control the heroin highway.

19:29.354 --> 19:31.356
Not all of it.

19:31.388 --> 19:33.558
The part where the Low Note Club is?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.459
There's a lot of gangs
involved in there.

19:35.492 --> 19:37.995
Yeah, that may be.

19:38.029 --> 19:42.200
But you're the one calling the shots.

19:42.232 --> 19:44.735
I'll tell you what I think, Lamar.

19:44.769 --> 19:47.204
See, I think the Burtons
came to you with a deal.

19:47.238 --> 19:50.607
You liked it. You accepted it.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.643
But they couldn't come up
with all the cash,

19:52.676 --> 19:57.081
and, well, you didn't like that.

19:57.115 --> 19:59.084
So you popped them.

19:59.117 --> 20:01.453
And in the process

20:01.485 --> 20:03.988
you killed that whole construction deal.

20:05.022 --> 20:08.126
'Cause no one's gonna
want to build there.

20:08.158 --> 20:09.962
Not now.

20:13.498 --> 20:16.501
We done?

20:16.533 --> 20:18.669
'Cause I'm done talking.

20:19.771 --> 20:21.673
That's fine.

20:23.774 --> 20:27.111
'Cause you already told me
everything I need to know.

20:45.296 --> 20:47.432
Have you thought about your future?

20:48.698 --> 20:52.403
You are damn close to a fat pension.

20:52.436 --> 20:57.041
Spending time with your family,
lazy days on a boat in Florida.

20:57.075 --> 20:58.809
I'd hate to see you lose all that

20:58.842 --> 21:02.346
after years of dedicated service.

21:02.379 --> 21:04.515
Is there a reason I would?

21:08.853 --> 21:12.490
IAD filled me in
on the Bingham investigation.

21:12.522 --> 21:15.260
Besides the DNA match,

21:15.292 --> 21:18.695
they have a witness
who saw you and a young woman

21:18.729 --> 21:20.799
at the Super Mart construction site,

21:20.831 --> 21:23.734
same place we recovered Bingham's body.

21:23.768 --> 21:27.072
And the only reason you were
involved in any of this

21:27.105 --> 21:29.207
is because of Voight.

21:29.240 --> 21:33.111
You had no ax to grind
with that man Bingham.

21:33.144 --> 21:35.180
But you cooperate...

21:36.746 --> 21:39.450
You get full immunity.

21:39.483 --> 21:41.519
You stay on the job.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.721
Keep your full pension.

21:48.559 --> 21:51.195
I got nothing to say.

21:51.229 --> 21:53.264
You sure about that?

21:53.297 --> 21:57.769
See, you're protecting Voight
because that's your code.

21:59.604 --> 22:02.240
But you're the last of a breed.

22:02.272 --> 22:05.109
Loyalty above all else.

22:08.512 --> 22:10.714
Let me ask you something.

22:10.748 --> 22:14.853
You think Voight would fall
on his sword to protect you?

22:15.786 --> 22:18.623
Nah. He wouldn't.

22:20.524 --> 22:22.226
I know Voight.

22:22.260 --> 22:25.597
I do, too.

22:56.961 --> 23:00.498
We pulled video surveillance
from Arthur Burton's shooting.

23:00.530 --> 23:02.300
Blue Chrysler sedan.

23:02.332 --> 23:04.701
Just like the Rolex thief said
sped away from the crime scene.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.570
We ran the plates,
and we put out a BOLO.

23:06.604 --> 23:08.173
The car is registered to a Keon Walters.

23:08.205 --> 23:09.573
We're trying to find his home address.

23:09.906 --> 23:12.577
Car was just spotted behind
Landon's Market on Archer.

23:12.609 --> 23:14.212
All right, get over there now.

23:14.244 --> 23:15.713
Nice work.

23:17.615 --> 23:18.817
Let's talk.

23:24.387 --> 23:26.223
You hear anything else?

23:26.257 --> 23:27.859
No, nothing.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.766
What about Woods? You talk to him?

23:36.600 --> 23:37.868
I did.

23:38.836 --> 23:41.306
I'm guessing you already know that.

23:42.673 --> 23:44.709
What did he say?

23:46.711 --> 23:48.479
Well, he claims he's got a witness

23:48.511 --> 23:50.647
that saw me and a woman

23:50.681 --> 23:53.585
near Bingham's burial site

23:53.617 --> 23:55.287
18 months ago.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.291
He say anything more about this woman?

24:01.325 --> 24:02.961
Twenties.

24:02.993 --> 24:04.628
Dark hair.

24:06.896 --> 24:08.633
It's only a matter of time
before he figures out

24:08.665 --> 24:09.966
who it is.

24:13.838 --> 24:15.706
Might be a bluff.

24:18.842 --> 24:22.446
You know, wants us to panic,
make mistakes.

24:29.419 --> 24:31.689
I'll do some digging.

24:51.841 --> 24:53.377
Driver's getting in the car.

24:53.411 --> 24:56.014
Yep, we got eyes. No passenger visible.

24:56.047 --> 24:57.949
- You ready?
- Yeah.

25:07.857 --> 25:10.729
Keon Walters! Get out of the car!

25:11.395 --> 25:12.664
Out of the car!

25:12.696 --> 25:13.864
Hey!

25:13.897 --> 25:15.732
Turn off the car!

25:15.765 --> 25:18.469
Turn the car off and get out of the car!

25:26.444 --> 25:27.712
<i>5021 George emergency.</i>

25:27.744 --> 25:29.379
<i>We're in pursuit of a blue Chrysler</i>

25:29.413 --> 25:31.683
fleeing northbound on Levy,
just past 13th street.

25:31.715 --> 25:34.519
Illinois tag 65 George Ida 8 Charlie.

26:20.897 --> 26:22.666
Police! Show me your hands.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.068
Let me see your hands!

26:24.100 --> 26:26.905
Put your hands on the glass. Do it now!

26:27.905 --> 26:30.107
Get out of the car.
Put your hands on the roof.

26:30.140 --> 26:31.542
Don't move.

26:46.557 --> 26:48.960
AR-15 assault rifle.

26:50.194 --> 26:51.495
Bingo.

26:53.626 --> 26:54.962
Let's go.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.959
Keon Walters, age 21,
he lives at 907 Fillmore.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.412
- No priors.
- He's not in our system.

27:01.437 --> 27:03.334
He's not in the gang database either.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.150
- Ballistics?
- It's a match.

27:05.184 --> 27:07.173
The rifle in Keon's trunk
was used in both murders.

27:07.198 --> 27:09.362
- Prints?
- No, and this is where it gets weird.

27:09.402 --> 27:11.338
We reached out to the banker, Finnegan.

27:11.371 --> 27:13.140
He said he's certain Keon's not the guy

27:13.173 --> 27:15.075
he saw scoping out the bar
the night of the murder.

27:15.109 --> 27:17.412
Yeah, we searched his car,
belongings. No phone.

27:17.445 --> 27:19.112
Only things we found
other than the rifle

27:19.146 --> 27:20.348
were a pair of size 12 boots

27:20.380 --> 27:22.150
and an extra-large winter jacket.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.318
- All right, me and you.
- Size 12?

27:24.351 --> 27:27.287
Those kicks can't be Keon's.
Kid's barely 5'6".

27:27.321 --> 27:29.557
Sounds like the kid
might have a partner.

27:29.590 --> 27:31.426
All right, run him
through facial rec online.

27:31.458 --> 27:34.062
See if you can find who he hangs with.

27:38.765 --> 27:40.534
One potato.

27:42.602 --> 27:44.171
Two potato.

27:45.072 --> 27:47.275
Rifle we found in your trunk.

27:49.075 --> 27:50.745
It's the same weapon used to kill

27:50.777 --> 27:52.546
Alderman Burton and his son.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.314
<i>I didn't kill no one.</i>

27:54.348 --> 27:55.951
<i>Okay.</i>

27:57.017 --> 27:58.352
<i>So tell me.</i>

27:58.386 --> 28:00.488
<i>How'd the rifle end up in your trunk?</i>

28:00.521 --> 28:01.656
<i>Hm?</i>

28:01.688 --> 28:04.158
<i>Can you tell me that?</i>

28:04.190 --> 28:06.326
<i>We know you got a partner.</i>

28:06.360 --> 28:09.063
C'mon. You seem like a pretty good kid.

28:09.095 --> 28:11.465
No arrests, no gang affiliations.

28:11.498 --> 28:13.066
That's why we're guessing

28:13.100 --> 28:14.702
you're not the one doing the shooting.

28:14.735 --> 28:18.171
Which means you have a chance
to cut yourself a deal.

28:18.205 --> 28:21.208
Hm. All you got to do...

28:21.242 --> 28:23.011
Give us who you're working with.

28:23.044 --> 28:25.112
I got nothing to say.

28:25.146 --> 28:27.148
Look, bro, I know it feels good.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.516
Keep your mouth shut. Be loyal.

28:30.784 --> 28:32.620
But it's stupid.

28:32.652 --> 28:34.354
It's stupid.

28:34.388 --> 28:36.124
'Cause...

28:37.525 --> 28:40.594
You're the one who's gonna
end up doing the time.

28:40.628 --> 28:43.398
<i>Not your buddy.</i>

28:43.430 --> 28:46.066
<i>You.</i>

28:46.100 --> 28:48.369
<i>You understand?</i>

28:48.401 --> 28:51.538
<i>And life in prison is no joke, bro.</i>

28:51.572 --> 28:53.440
It's forever.

28:55.642 --> 28:57.411
<i>Every day.</i>

28:57.445 --> 28:59.047
<i>Every night.</i>

28:59.080 --> 29:01.282
<i>For the rest of your existence.</i>

29:02.749 --> 29:06.353
Hoping some dude you made
eye contact with at breakfast

29:06.387 --> 29:09.524
doesn't stick a shiv in your neck.

29:13.294 --> 29:14.762
Be smart.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.631
This is your life, Keon.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.569
There's nobody worth sacrificing

29:21.601 --> 29:24.072
<i>that for, believe me.</i>

29:24.104 --> 29:26.339
<i>Nobody.</i>

29:26.372 --> 29:29.110
<i>So.</i>

29:31.344 --> 29:33.547
I got nothing to say.

29:45.226 --> 29:47.160
Where'd you get this photo?

29:47.194 --> 29:49.330
Online. Facial recognition.

29:51.332 --> 29:54.267
- Is Keon in trouble?
- Yeah.

29:54.301 --> 29:55.602
We think he's involved in the murder

29:55.636 --> 29:58.139
of an alderman and his son.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.173
No way. Couldn't be Keon.

30:00.207 --> 30:01.708
- No?
- You sure?

30:01.742 --> 30:03.177
Know him pretty well?

30:03.209 --> 30:05.112
We met in high school.

30:05.146 --> 30:08.616
I see him every few months
when he comes to the hospital.

30:08.649 --> 30:12.652
- He's got sickle cell anemia.
- Oh, uh, yeah.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.554
Do you know if he's in a gang?

30:14.588 --> 30:17.658
No, he's a nice guy.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.826
We went on a couple of dates.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.529
I'm telling you he's not killer.

30:21.562 --> 30:24.799
Okay, well, if you want to
help him and I think you do,

30:24.832 --> 30:26.367
just tell us everything you know.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.503
- I am. I swear.
- What about his friends?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.470
Any of them in gangs that you know of?

30:30.504 --> 30:32.372
No.

30:32.406 --> 30:34.709
But I'm pretty sure his cousin is.

30:34.742 --> 30:36.409
He comes to Keon's
appointments sometimes.

30:36.442 --> 30:38.178
Okay, what's his cousin's name?

30:38.211 --> 30:40.515
Keon calls him LJ.
I don't know his real name.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.650
It's probably in
the visitors' log somewhere.

30:43.684 --> 30:46.420
- Noted.
- Thank you.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.623
Why don't you tell us
about your cousin...

30:48.656 --> 30:50.725
Lamar Jenkins.

30:50.757 --> 30:52.826
LJ?

30:52.860 --> 30:54.928
Yeah, you know big cuz.

30:54.961 --> 30:56.496
Runs the Westside Disciples.

30:56.530 --> 30:58.166
And everything on the heroin highway.

30:58.198 --> 30:59.432
That much we do know.

30:59.466 --> 31:00.400
Lamar is the one who actually

31:00.434 --> 31:02.570
did the murders, right?

31:02.602 --> 31:04.604
<i>It's either him or you, Keon.</i>

31:04.638 --> 31:06.640
<i>Don't know what you're talking about.</i>

31:06.673 --> 31:09.209
This kid's not gonna crack
no matter how hard we push.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.477
Nah, we'll break him.

31:10.511 --> 31:13.281
Just got to find his weakness.

31:14.715 --> 31:17.752
Everybody's got a breaking point, Al.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.689
No matter how strong you are.

31:22.723 --> 31:25.592
Well, not everyone.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.938
We can't find a home address for Lamar.

31:36.970 --> 31:38.672
You check out that bar I told you about?

31:38.706 --> 31:40.507
Yeah, he's not there.
Patrol stopped by an hour ago.

31:40.541 --> 31:41.876
The place looks shut down.

31:41.909 --> 31:43.311
You know, he's probably been on the run

31:43.343 --> 31:44.678
ever since we pinched his cousin.

31:44.711 --> 31:46.246
You're probably right.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.516
Guess we have to come up
with a different approach.

31:48.548 --> 31:49.950
I assume we still got his coat.

31:49.984 --> 31:51.619
Mm-hmm.

31:51.651 --> 31:53.286
You keep playing tough guy, Keon,

31:53.320 --> 31:54.822
the clock is gonna run out.

31:54.854 --> 31:56.556
Hey.

31:56.590 --> 31:59.293
Just talked to the ASA.
Told me to kick him free.

31:59.325 --> 32:00.361
What? You serious?

32:00.393 --> 32:01.561
He ain't talking and we don't

32:01.594 --> 32:02.996
have enough to charge him. Come on.

32:03.030 --> 32:05.230
You can grab your stuff downstairs.

32:06.332 --> 32:08.602
But stay in town. This ain't over.

32:20.648 --> 32:21.902
You all set?

32:21.927 --> 32:24.294
Yeah, I put a tracker
and mic in his coat.

32:25.518 --> 32:27.255
He's coming out, Jay.

32:30.024 --> 32:32.230
Copy that, Sarge. We're in position.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.176
This kid might be on to us.

32:45.201 --> 32:46.793
He's been walking for 20 minutes.

32:46.818 --> 32:48.847
Yeah, maybe he just wanted
some distance from the station.

32:48.909 --> 32:50.574
Maybe.

32:52.783 --> 32:54.752
He just went in to a mini-mart.

32:56.374 --> 32:59.077
He's dialing.
He must have bought a burner.

32:59.109 --> 33:01.011
<i>Yo, it's Keon. Come get me.</i>

33:01.045 --> 33:03.314
<i>I'm on Roosevelt near Saint Ignatius.</i>

33:03.347 --> 33:04.382
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:04.415 --> 33:07.117
<i>And tell Lamar to stay in Riverdale.</i>

33:07.151 --> 33:09.421
<i>The police are looking for him.</i>

33:09.453 --> 33:10.989
<i>All right.</i>

33:11.021 --> 33:12.723
Sarge, Lamar's in Riverdale.

33:12.757 --> 33:15.060
There's a Disciples house
at 290 Pine Street.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.929
<i>You and Upton scoop up Keon. Now.</i>

33:17.962 --> 33:19.129
<i>We'll take down Lamar.</i>

33:19.163 --> 33:21.031
- Copy.
- All right.

33:31.309 --> 33:32.976
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.945
Chicago PD!

33:34.979 --> 33:37.182
Put your hands in the air. Out!

33:37.214 --> 33:38.249
- Got the stairs.
- Okay.

33:38.281 --> 33:39.384
Put your hands up.

33:39.416 --> 33:41.118
I want you to take a step back

33:41.152 --> 33:43.288
- from that knife, ma'am.
- Upstairs clear.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.222
Where's Lamar Jenkins?

33:46.223 --> 33:48.225
There's no sign of Lamar in here.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.028
Hey. You hear that?

33:50.060 --> 33:51.463
Run.

33:54.799 --> 33:58.103
- I got this side.
- All right, go ahead.

33:59.803 --> 34:00.871
Check it out.

34:00.905 --> 34:03.375
- You ready?
- Go, go.

34:06.777 --> 34:07.846
Are you kidding me?

34:22.492 --> 34:24.328
Take the helmet off.

35:02.132 --> 35:04.335
Must be a stash house.

35:04.367 --> 35:06.538
There's got to be at least 200 Gs here.

35:08.438 --> 35:11.442
Whoa. Is this a stash house?

35:12.442 --> 35:14.545
Yeah, it looks that way.

35:15.478 --> 35:17.181
Atwater and Ruzek are transporting

35:17.215 --> 35:18.561
Lamar back to the District.

35:18.585 --> 35:20.054
All right, good.

35:20.087 --> 35:23.090
All right, clear it out.
Log it into evidence.

35:32.933 --> 35:35.902
This is your one and only shot, Lamar.

35:35.935 --> 35:38.004
You got the wrong man.

35:38.672 --> 35:39.840
We have the weapon.

35:39.873 --> 35:41.909
And we got your cousin, Keon.

35:41.942 --> 35:44.545
He's on audio referring
to you as the shooter.

35:44.578 --> 35:47.982
That's my nickname.
From when I played basketball.

35:48.881 --> 35:51.117
All we had to do
was offer Keon a deal, bro.

35:51.151 --> 35:52.986
Offer all you want.

35:53.020 --> 35:56.556
Keon? He's old school. He won't talk.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.892
So y'all can kiss my ass.

36:05.299 --> 36:06.567
Thanks.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.134
All right, just talked to the lab.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.836
Lamar's prints weren't on the car.

36:09.870 --> 36:10.938
All right, what about Finnegan?

36:10.971 --> 36:12.885
He able to make a positive ID?

36:12.910 --> 36:14.146
All Finnegan said that

36:14.171 --> 36:15.507
he can't tell if it was the guy or not.

36:15.532 --> 36:17.201
Honestly to me it sounds like
he didn't want

36:17.226 --> 36:18.395
to get involve with the gang stuff.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.323
We still have enough to arrest.

36:20.357 --> 36:24.393
Maybe. We sure as hell don't
have enough to convict.

36:24.426 --> 36:27.363
Our only real shot is to flip Keon.

36:27.397 --> 36:29.833
Who refuses to flip.

36:36.806 --> 36:39.877
Well, we arrested Lamar
for both murders.

36:41.178 --> 36:42.379
I'll tell you this.

36:42.411 --> 36:44.447
Cuz ain't excited about doing no time.

36:44.480 --> 36:48.351
- What's that mean?
- That means that he talkin'.

36:48.384 --> 36:50.353
He is talkin'.
Man, that boy gave you up.

36:50.386 --> 36:52.890
He said you the real trigger man.

36:55.058 --> 36:56.393
Is that true?

37:00.096 --> 37:02.099
Yeah.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.534
Yeah, it was me.

37:03.567 --> 37:04.967
I did it on my own.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.203
Don't do that.

37:06.236 --> 37:07.571
Don't eat this for him.

37:07.603 --> 37:09.071
C'mon, bro, you...

37:09.105 --> 37:10.207
He's supposed to be your family.

37:10.239 --> 37:11.408
He working your girl.

37:12.408 --> 37:14.577
Ah, you didn't know about Rochelle?

37:14.578 --> 37:16.446
- She ain't my girl.
- C'mon, man.

37:16.478 --> 37:18.515
You don't got to do that, man.
We know you like her.

37:18.547 --> 37:20.183
I mean, we could tell
by your social media.

37:20.216 --> 37:21.517
You like her a lot.

37:21.551 --> 37:23.920
Look what we found on her Facebook page.

37:25.154 --> 37:26.923
Looks like they've been hanging out.

37:26.957 --> 37:29.125
We didn't even want to show you those.

37:29.158 --> 37:31.027
What happens when you go to jail, man?

37:31.060 --> 37:33.029
And your cousin, Rochelle, they

37:33.062 --> 37:34.964
start doing more than hanging out.

37:40.036 --> 37:41.405
Man, Lamar can have this bitch.

37:44.207 --> 37:45.875
I ain't talking.

37:48.879 --> 37:51.348
This guy's loyal.

37:51.380 --> 37:53.317
We just haven't found
his breaking point.

37:53.350 --> 37:57.587
I had a partner way back.
His kid had sickle cell.

37:57.621 --> 37:59.924
Terrible chronic pain.

38:01.491 --> 38:02.893
Hm.

38:09.132 --> 38:10.300
All right, Keon, listen.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.436
Before we officially charge you

38:12.469 --> 38:14.538
just want to go over a few things.

38:14.571 --> 38:18.408
You're gonna be in Cook County
so medical care is limited.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.444
- But I have sickle cell.
- Yeah, I know.

38:20.476 --> 38:22.179
That's why I'm here. Okay?

38:22.212 --> 38:24.547
This form outlines the medical care.

38:24.580 --> 38:26.182
Here, just sign here at the bottom.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.884
All it says is that you received a copy.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.553
Man, I freak out every few months.

38:29.585 --> 38:31.187
I mean, they're gonna take me
to the hospital, right?

38:31.221 --> 38:33.357
- No. You're in lockup.
- Yeah.

38:33.390 --> 38:34.924
- Is the pain really that bad?
- Yes!

38:34.958 --> 38:37.294
Well, you can get
some aspirin or ibuprofen.

38:37.326 --> 38:38.361
- Yeah.
- No, I need IV Demerol.

38:38.395 --> 38:39.563
- Right.
- Oh, man.

38:39.596 --> 38:41.231
Like, aspirin don't do nothing.

38:41.263 --> 38:43.065
Demerol's the only thing
that stops the pain.

38:43.098 --> 38:44.333
- Like, I need it.
- Okay.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.937
Look, listen.

38:46.969 --> 38:49.339
You're not gonna get a
Schedule II narcotic in prison.

38:49.371 --> 38:51.241
There's no way.

38:52.375 --> 38:54.978
Oh, man.

38:55.011 --> 38:57.982
I'm sure I can figure out
a way to skirt the rules.

38:59.549 --> 39:02.052
But you got to play ball.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.462
I drove the car.

39:12.328 --> 39:14.063
All right? I drove the car.

39:14.096 --> 39:16.232
But it's all I did. I swear.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.534
Look, man, I ain't never shoot nobody.

39:21.036 --> 39:24.006
That was all Lamar.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.509
I swear to God.

39:46.429 --> 39:48.966
Talked to some sources.

39:48.998 --> 39:50.667
The witness is real.

39:51.567 --> 39:53.502
How did Internal Affairs find this guy?

39:53.536 --> 39:56.673
They called that tip line Woods set up.

39:56.705 --> 39:58.942
$5,000 reward.

40:02.011 --> 40:03.279
You know, it's probably a good idea

40:03.312 --> 40:05.281
to get Erin on the same page.

40:05.315 --> 40:08.385
You know... get our stories straight.

40:08.417 --> 40:11.521
No. Not so sure about that.

40:23.333 --> 40:26.070
We'll get through this.

40:28.737 --> 40:31.741
But like you said, everyone's
got a breaking point.

40:31.775 --> 40:33.677
Keon's was Demerol.

40:36.812 --> 40:39.082
Yours is Erin.

40:43.553 --> 40:46.089
What's yours, Al?
