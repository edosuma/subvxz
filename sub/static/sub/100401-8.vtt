17:42.456 --> 17:43.876
Not naming any names. Emily.

17:43.876 --> 17:45.211
‐ You gotta‐‐
you have to wrap‐‐

17:45.211 --> 17:46.590
FRAN: Excuse me?
‐ You have to wrap it up.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.343
‐ I want ten minutes more.
‐ No, no.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.388
‐ So guys,
let's get fuckin' wasted

17:50.388 --> 17:51.516
and blow up
some fuckin' fireworks.

17:51.516 --> 17:53.896
[all cheering]

17:56.860 --> 17:57.862
‐ [laughter]
‐ Okay, okay,

17:57.862 --> 17:58.864
I'm a Sagittarius,

17:58.864 --> 17:59.991
are we compatible?

17:59.991 --> 18:02.329
‐ Uh, yes, very, actually.
BOTH: Ooh!

18:02.329 --> 18:04.083
‐ Oh, yeah, great.
‐ Okay, are we compatible?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.922
‐ I'm a Taurus.
‐ Ohh. Uh, no.

18:06.922 --> 18:08.341
‐ No?
‐ No, we're actually

18:08.341 --> 18:09.511
‐ mortal enemies.
‐ What?

18:09.511 --> 18:11.013
‐ No!
‐ But I love you

18:11.013 --> 18:12.474
and sometimes
the stars are wrong.

18:12.474 --> 18:13.727
‐ They're wrong.
‐ Okay,

18:13.727 --> 18:15.063
‐ I'm gonna get more wine.
‐ Wait.

18:17.819 --> 18:21.117
‐ Um, Annie.
‐ What?

18:24.708 --> 18:29.216
Oh. Okay. Okay.

18:29.216 --> 18:30.886
‐ Hey, Annie.
‐ Hey.

18:32.305 --> 18:35.270
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ I brought you this.

18:35.270 --> 18:36.982
It's tomorrow's paper.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.198
‐ Holy shit.

18:41.198 --> 18:43.746
‐ Oh.
‐ Pretty cool, right?

18:43.746 --> 18:44.748
‐ Yeah.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.507
Yeah. Yeah, oh, my God.

18:49.507 --> 18:53.766
I can't believe I'm, like,
the whole cover.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.270
I could cry right now.

18:56.270 --> 18:57.648
Thank you. Um‐‐

18:59.193 --> 19:02.449
It's just, you know, I did
ask you for space tonight.

19:02.449 --> 19:04.411
‐ Oh, yeah, I know.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.875
I just don't think
I could even sleep.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.714
Like, if we don't
work this out, so‐‐

19:09.714 --> 19:11.676
‐ Maybe we can just talk.
‐ No.

19:11.676 --> 19:13.095
No, you know,
I'm, like, trying

19:13.095 --> 19:14.682
to have a night
with my friends.

19:14.682 --> 19:16.603
Can we just talk about it
tomorrow?

19:17.772 --> 19:20.778
‐ Annie. Please.

19:23.992 --> 19:27.917
‐ Okay, okay, okay.
Let's go.

19:29.378 --> 19:33.261
‐ Okay. Well, that's a mess.
‐ [both laugh]

19:33.261 --> 19:35.098
‐ Yeah, totally.
‐ Now to get more wine.

19:35.098 --> 19:37.185
‐ Can I‐‐uh‐‐

19:37.812 --> 19:39.439
[stammers]

19:39.439 --> 19:41.736
Sorry, I‐‐I don't think

19:41.736 --> 19:44.951
that there's gonna be, like,
a great time to do this.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.999
Um, I know you're doing
the whole single thing,

19:47.999 --> 19:51.590
and I think that's great. Um‐‐

19:51.590 --> 19:54.554
But I‐‐I do‐‐

19:54.554 --> 19:57.017
‐ I‐‐
‐ You what? Just say it.

19:57.017 --> 19:59.271
‐ Be quiet, you idiot.
I‐‐[chuckles]

19:59.271 --> 20:00.900
I'm trying to tell you
I like you.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.699
Um, yeah.

20:04.699 --> 20:07.412
I‐‐I like you a lot.

20:07.412 --> 20:08.999
‐ Why are you saying this now?

20:08.999 --> 20:10.376
‐ When was I supposed
to say it?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.339
When you were going
through your breakup with Vic?

20:12.339 --> 20:14.009
When you were being celibate?

20:14.009 --> 20:15.846
When you were
constantly talking about

20:15.846 --> 20:17.098
how single you were?

20:17.098 --> 20:19.061
I know my timing sucks,

20:19.061 --> 20:20.731
but I am doing this now.

20:22.652 --> 20:24.572
So now you know.

20:24.572 --> 20:26.785
‐ Now I know.

20:28.329 --> 20:30.542
‐ Did I fuck it up?

20:30.542 --> 20:32.253
‐ [exhales]

20:33.590 --> 20:35.636
‐ I fucked it up.
‐ [laughs]

20:35.636 --> 20:37.263
‐ I fucked it up!

20:37.263 --> 20:39.059
‐ I feel horrible

20:39.059 --> 20:41.355
I mean, I loved fucking you
in the office,

20:41.355 --> 20:44.069
but I get that I fucked
everything up.

20:44.069 --> 20:47.033
‐ Yeah, but it's not that
we fucked in the office.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.162
It's that you told someone.

20:49.162 --> 20:50.916
And then they told everyone.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.212
And now I'm a fucking joke.

20:53.212 --> 20:57.387
‐ Yeah, but I didn't know
that I couldn't tell anyone.

20:57.387 --> 21:00.769
But I feel like
I've been trying really hard

21:00.769 --> 21:02.815
and I've been getting better.

21:02.815 --> 21:04.276
‐ No, you‐‐you have.

21:04.276 --> 21:06.781
You really have been better.

21:06.781 --> 21:12.417
Um‐‐it's just‐‐um‐‐
I shouldn't have to tell you...

21:12.417 --> 21:15.298
that our sex life is private,
you know?

21:15.298 --> 21:16.760
‐ I mean, it's the same
with all the stuff.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.807
It's like, you just tell me
what to do,

21:19.807 --> 21:21.811
and I will do it, Annie.

21:21.811 --> 21:24.525
I'll do, like,
whatever you want.

21:24.525 --> 21:28.449
‐ Yeah, but I don't wanna
have to tell you what to do.

21:28.449 --> 21:32.666
Like, I don't wanna
be your mom

21:32.666 --> 21:35.506
because I cannot
fuck my son.

21:35.506 --> 21:36.841
I want an adult.

21:36.841 --> 21:40.264
‐ Like, I want a real partner.
‐ [Fran laughs]

21:40.264 --> 21:42.268
‐ Oh, fuck.

21:45.108 --> 21:47.445
‐ Okay. Come on.
‐ Oh.

21:47.445 --> 21:49.742
‐ Should we stop?
Am I ruining Fran Fest?

21:49.742 --> 21:51.203
‐ Shut up.
‐ [laughs]

21:51.203 --> 21:52.581
‐ We need to talk
about this, Annie.

21:52.581 --> 21:54.459
‐ Yeah, I know, I know.

21:54.459 --> 21:56.631
‐ So can we work through this?

21:56.631 --> 21:59.846
Can we just talk through this
like we did the back fence?

22:01.181 --> 22:03.269
‐ Oh, the back fence?

22:03.269 --> 22:07.068
Our very solid foundation
for our relationship?

22:07.068 --> 22:09.281
Where you made me climb
over a back fence

22:09.281 --> 22:10.784
'cause you were embarrassed
of me?

22:10.784 --> 22:13.164
‐ Well, you were
embarrassed of me

22:13.164 --> 22:14.709
at Gabe's party.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.921
And you wouldn't even
talk to me at work.

22:16.921 --> 22:19.844
‐ Well, then, if we make
each other feel that bad,

22:19.844 --> 22:21.263
then we really
shouldn't be together.

22:21.263 --> 22:23.894
‐ Annie, don't say that.

22:23.894 --> 22:27.066
‐ I'm sorry. I'll fix it.
‐ No, Ryan,

22:27.066 --> 22:28.945
if I'm being honest,

22:28.945 --> 22:31.325
like, I think I've been trying
to make this work with you

22:31.325 --> 22:34.414
just because being with you
is like...

22:34.414 --> 22:35.834
easier.

22:36.794 --> 22:38.172
‐ What does that mean?

22:39.049 --> 22:44.476
‐ Easier than fucking facing
putting myself out there

22:44.476 --> 22:48.317
and having guys
not even consider dating me

22:48.317 --> 22:49.862
because I'm fat.

22:49.862 --> 22:52.450
‐ I love you.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.414
I told you‐‐I‐‐
I'm past that.

22:55.414 --> 22:57.962
‐ Yeah, but I'm not, okay?

22:57.962 --> 22:59.381
I'm not past it,

22:59.381 --> 23:01.970
and I can never get past it,
not with you.

23:03.055 --> 23:05.644
‐ What is happening right now?

23:05.644 --> 23:07.063
Are you breaking up with me?

23:08.733 --> 23:11.488
‐ Actually, yes, I am.

23:14.829 --> 23:17.208
‐ So this is it?

23:17.208 --> 23:19.170
‐ We're over?
‐ Yes.

23:20.882 --> 23:22.343
‐ Jesus, Annie.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.020
Well, what are you
gonna do now?

23:27.020 --> 23:29.692
You're gonna go date
other guys?

23:31.696 --> 23:34.660
‐ Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.
